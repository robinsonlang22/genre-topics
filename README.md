# Topic Modelling of Various Literature Genres
The study utilized the topic modelling method to research the differences in the represented topics of different literature genres. The three genres are **children**, **fantasy**, **science-fiction**, and their sub-genres. The corpus is built based on the original texts extracted from **SPGC** through text and genre indices processing. The **LDA model** was selected to do the topic modelling tasks. The topic number of the LDA model was optimized objectively by **topic coherence** and subjectively by **pyLDAvis**.
