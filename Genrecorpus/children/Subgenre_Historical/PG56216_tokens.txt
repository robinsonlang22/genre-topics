rodney
the
overseer
chapter
i
a
disgusted
home
guard
i
do
say
that
you
fellows
played
the
part
of
cowards
by
firing
into
that
unarmed
boat
but
you
acted
like
born
idiots
and
it
would
serve
you
just
right
if
the
citizens
of
baton
rouge
should
come
out
here
in
a
body
and
lynch
the
last
one
of
you
why
do
you
not
wait
for
orders
from
me
instead
of
roaming
about
the
country
acting
on
your
own
responsibility
i
know
what
the
confederacy
expects
this
company
to
do
and
you
do
now
jest
listen
at
you
tom
randolph
yes
listen
when
your
commanding
officer
speaks
and
remember
that
there
is
a
handle
to
my
name
and
that
i
expect
you
to
use
it
as
often
as
you
address
me
well
randolph
if
that
suits
you
any
better
though
mighty
little
you
ever
done
to
deserve
the
title
when
this
company
of
ourn
was
first
got
up
did
you
say
that
we
was
going
to
make
all
the
union
men
about
here
hunt
their
holes
yes
i
did
and
i
would
have
done
it
in
a
manner
if
you
had
obeyed
my
orders
as
you
promised
to
do
when
you
were
sworn
into
the
service
but
when
you
made
up
your
minds
that
you
knew
more
than
your
captain
and
set
out
to
have
your
own
way
you
got
yourselves
into
hot
water
directly
and
i
am
very
glad
of
it
if
you
have
come
to
your
senses
and
will
promise
that
from
this
time
on
you
will
obey
my
orders
to
the
letter
and
quit
going
off
on
raids
unless
i
send
you
i
will
do
the
best
i
can
for
you
but
the
minute
you
take
the
bits
in
your
teeth
as
you
have
been
doing
for
the
last
few
months
that
minute
i
will
throw
you
over
and
the
conscript
officer
can
take
you
and
welcome
and
mark
my
words
this
is
the
last
warning
i
shall
give
you
the
last
one
of
you
ought
to
be
and
shot
it
was
a
motley
group
of
men
and
boys
perhaps
a
score
of
them
in
all
who
were
gathered
at
the
foot
of
the
wide
steps
that
led
up
to
the
front
door
of
randolph
plantation
house
and
one
could
have
told
at
a
glance
that
they
were
as
excited
and
angry
as
was
the
young
officer
in
confederate
uniform
on
the
gallery
above
who
shook
his
fists
at
them
over
the
railing
and
addressed
them
in
the
imperious
language
we
have
just
recorded
the
most
of
the
group
were
dressed
like
soldiers
and
that
was
what
they
claimed
to
be
but
whether
they
belonged
to
the
union
or
confederate
army
it
would
have
been
hard
to
tell
for
their
clothing
was
an
odd
mixture
of
the
uniforms
of
both
it
would
have
been
quite
as
hard
to
tell
whether
they
belonged
to
the
artillery
infantry
or
cavalry
for
the
distinguishing
colors
of
these
three
branches
of
the
service
were
about
equally
represented
these
men
and
boys
called
themselves
home
guards
and
they
were
members
of
the
independent
company
that
tom
randolph
and
his
father
raised
and
equipped
after
tom
failed
to
get
himself
elected
second
lieutenant
of
captain
hubbard
rangers
you
remember
something
about
that
do
you
not
when
the
war
excitement
was
at
its
height
in
the
spring
of
and
rodney
gray
marcy
gray
cousin
left
the
military
academy
at
barrington
because
he
could
not
study
while
others
were
going
into
the
southern
army
and
making
ready
to
fight
for
the
cause
in
which
they
honestly
believed
he
was
bound
by
a
compact
he
had
made
with
some
other
rebels
in
his
class
to
enlist
within
hours
after
he
reached
home
provided
he
could
get
to
a
recruiting
office
in
that
time
the
uniform
he
wore
at
school
was
gray
and
so
was
the
one
adopted
by
those
who
were
determined
to
break
up
the
government
because
they
could
no
longer
do
as
they
pleased
with
it
and
impulsive
rodney
gray
carried
away
by
the
excitement
of
the
hour
declared
that
he
would
not
wear
any
other
color
until
the
south
had
gained
her
independence
he
found
it
easy
to
keep
the
first
part
of
his
promise
for
it
so
happened
that
he
came
home
in
time
to
join
an
independent
company
of
cavalry
that
was
being
raised
in
his
immediate
neighborhood
and
which
was
intended
to
be
so
very
select
that
no
applicant
could
get
into
the
company
if
a
single
member
of
it
objected
to
him
among
the
prominent
citizens
of
mooreville
who
took
a
deep
interest
in
the
organization
they
all
claimed
mooreville
as
their
home
although
some
of
them
lived
from
three
to
a
dozen
miles
outside
of
it
and
used
both
money
and
influence
to
help
it
along
was
randolph
father
if
any
young
fellow
who
stood
well
in
the
community
hesitated
to
send
in
his
name
because
he
could
not
raise
money
enough
to
buy
a
horse
and
fit
himself
out
as
well
as
the
other
rangers
were
fitted
out
randolph
was
prompt
to
come
to
his
aid
with
the
assurance
that
if
he
would
go
ahead
and
enlist
money
need
not
stand
in
his
way
for
the
horse
uniform
weapons
and
all
other
necessary
things
would
be
forthcoming
he
scoured
the
country
for
miles
around
for
recruits
and
did
so
much
in
other
ways
to
aid
the
company
that
when
the
rangers
made
their
first
camp
and
hoisted
above
it
the
flag
under
which
they
hoped
to
ride
to
victory
they
named
it
camp
randolph
this
gentleman
was
so
rabid
a
secessionist
that
he
was
utterly
unreasonable
in
fact
some
of
his
warmest
friends
declared
that
he
was
about
half
crazy
he
had
no
clearer
conception
of
the
sufferings
and
trials
that
he
and
those
who
believed
as
he
did
were
bringing
upon
the
people
of
the
south
than
the
most
ignorant
negro
on
his
plantations
the
men
of
the
north
belonged
to
an
inferior
race
and
did
not
know
how
to
fight
they
were
going
to
be
whipped
without
any
trouble
at
all
and
when
the
southern
troops
had
covered
themselves
with
glory
by
taking
and
holding
washington
while
jefferson
davis
dictated
terms
of
peace
to
the
lincoln
hirelings
he
wanted
all
the
mooreville
boys
there
to
witness
the
grand
and
imposing
spectacle
and
that
was
why
he
urged
them
to
enlist
that
was
about
what
randolph
said
and
no
doubt
he
was
honest
with
himself
as
well
as
with
the
recruits
he
brought
into
captain
hubbard
company
but
events
proved
that
he
had
another
object
in
view
and
one
that
he
did
not
think
it
best
to
speak
of
tom
randolph
who
was
years
of
age
was
as
conceited
an
ignoramus
as
there
was
in
that
part
of
louisiana
but
he
had
an
idea
that
he
was
very
bright
and
capable
of
filling
any
office
he
could
get
at
first
he
declared
his
intention
of
going
to
the
front
as
captain
of
the
rangers
it
would
be
no
more
than
right
that
he
should
have
the
highest
place
in
return
for
what
his
father
had
done
for
the
company
but
when
randolph
told
him
that
would
be
aiming
a
little
too
high
that
bob
hubbard
who
had
really
done
more
hard
work
for
the
company
than
anybody
else
would
certainly
be
chosen
captain
and
that
it
would
look
better
and
be
better
if
tom
would
accept
something
a
little
lower
down
and
work
his
way
up
the
young
man
decided
that
he
would
be
a
candidate
for
the
second
place
he
was
sure
he
would
get
it
and
so
was
his
father
but
he
did
although
the
rangers
not
know
anything
about
soldiering
they
did
know
what
sort
of
men
they
wanted
for
officers
and
tom
received
but
twelve
votes
out
of
own
and
those
of
the
eleven
recruits
his
father
had
brought
into
the
company
then
there
was
trouble
in
the
camp
and
if
tom
and
his
father
had
possessed
the
physical
power
they
would
have
thrashed
every
ranger
in
it
but
there
was
one
thing
about
it
if
they
could
not
have
a
voice
in
the
management
of
the
company
they
would
not
only
cease
to
support
it
but
would
do
their
best
to
break
it
up
and
tom
acted
upon
this
rule
or
ruin
policy
by
withdrawing
from
the
ranks
almost
as
soon
as
the
result
of
the
ballot
was
announced
his
example
being
followed
by
the
eleven
recruits
who
had
voted
for
him
now
let
see
how
they
will
get
on
with
their
partisan
rangers
tom
said
to
his
father
that
night
there
almost
too
much
social
equality
in
that
company
anyway
to
suit
me
i
have
noticed
it
ever
since
i
have
been
in
it
who
is
their
second
lieutenant
the
man
they
shoved
into
my
place
a
common
who
never
in
his
life
had
the
price
of
a
pickaninny
in
his
pocket
tom
hoped
and
believed
that
by
withdrawing
from
the
company
he
had
inflicted
a
blow
upon
it
from
which
it
would
never
recover
but
to
his
surprise
and
disgust
the
rangers
went
ahead
with
their
plans
as
if
nothing
had
happened
rodney
gray
the
only
member
of
the
organization
who
knew
anything
about
military
matters
was
made
first
duty
sergeant
and
and
under
his
skillful
management
the
rangers
changed
so
rapidly
from
awkward
greenhorns
to
soldiers
and
became
so
proficient
in
the
school
of
the
company
that
the
deserters
with
the
single
exception
of
tom
randolph
himself
began
to
repent
their
hasty
action
and
ask
one
another
what
they
could
do
to
induce
the
rangers
to
take
them
back
again
they
knew
they
could
not
look
to
randolph
for
an
outfit
for
he
took
tom
defeat
as
a
deliberate
insult
to
his
family
and
instead
of
promoting
enlistments
in
the
company
was
doing
all
he
could
to
stop
them
the
only
one
they
could
turn
to
for
help
was
rodney
gray
man
who
had
said
and
done
nothing
of
consequence
to
show
that
he
was
in
favor
of
partisan
organizations
and
who
was
looked
upon
with
suspicion
by
his
neighbors
because
he
put
no
faith
in
the
final
success
of
the
secession
movement
and
did
not
hesitate
to
say
that
the
south
would
be
whipped
as
she
deserved
to
be
for
trying
to
break
up
the
government
there
were
thousands
of
wealthy
and
influential
men
in
louisiana
who
believed
as
he
did
and
yet
they
did
more
to
help
the
soldiers
than
the
blatant
rebels
who
were
fierce
for
a
fight
at
the
beginning
but
went
over
to
the
federals
at
the
first
opportunity
and
became
spies
and
informers
for
the
sake
of
the
loaves
and
fishes
that
fell
into
their
hands
the
sequel
proved
that
the
recruits
went
to
the
right
man
for
six
of
the
eleven
were
fitted
out
at
gray
expense
and
he
did
not
boast
of
it
either
as
randolph
and
tom
had
done
captain
hubbard
rangers
as
the
company
was
always
called
got
on
very
well
until
they
began
looking
around
for
someone
to
swear
them
into
the
service
and
order
them
to
the
front
and
then
the
trouble
began
they
first
applied
to
the
commanding
officer
at
new
orleans
but
he
declined
to
have
anything
to
do
with
them
unless
they
would
give
up
their
independent
organization
and
that
was
something
the
rangers
were
determined
they
would
not
do
to
please
anybody
they
formed
their
company
in
the
first
place
because
they
were
led
to
believe
that
the
richmond
government
was
in
full
sympathy
with
such
organizations
which
would
be
allowed
full
liberty
of
action
when
sworn
into
the
service
of
the
state
but
such
would
by
no
means
be
the
case
if
they
permitted
themselves
to
be
sworn
into
the
service
of
the
confederacy
as
one
of
the
rangers
expressed
it
if
they
were
going
to
give
their
liberty
up
to
a
new
government
they
might
as
well
have
stayed
under
the
old
tom
randolph
was
delighted
when
he
heard
of
this
state
of
affairs
and
the
rangers
themselves
were
much
depressed
but
rodney
gray
was
sure
he
saw
a
way
out
of
the
difficulty
when
he
received
a
letter
from
his
old
schoolmate
and
chum
dick
graham
who
lived
in
missouri
in
that
letter
dick
said
he
belonged
to
an
organization
of
partisans
who
were
known
as
state
guards
their
immediate
commander
was
general
price
but
they
were
required
to
take
oath
to
obey
governor
jackson
and
nobody
else
in
plain
english
this
meant
that
while
the
state
guards
were
willing
to
look
out
for
the
secession
movement
in
missouri
and
keep
all
yankee
invaders
off
her
soil
they
did
not
intend
to
go
into
any
other
state
unless
they
felt
like
it
or
permit
the
richmond
authorities
to
control
their
movements
in
any
way
that
was
exactly
the
kind
of
partisans
that
captain
hubbard
and
his
men
wanted
to
be
and
when
rodney
gray
said
that
if
the
governor
of
their
own
state
would
not
accept
them
as
a
company
they
had
a
perfect
right
to
offer
themselves
to
the
governor
of
another
and
that
it
might
be
a
good
plan
to
ask
general
price
if
he
would
take
the
rangers
just
as
they
were
captain
hubbard
was
glad
to
act
upon
the
suggestion
so
without
delay
a
telegram
was
sent
to
dick
graham
father
in
louis
and
in
due
time
the
answer
came
back
price
will
accept
company
officers
and
independent
organization
to
remain
the
same
to
quote
from
rodney
this
brought
the
matter
squarely
home
to
the
rangers
who
were
compelled
to
decide
upon
some
course
of
action
without
loss
of
time
a
business
meeting
of
the
company
and
a
stormy
one
it
turned
out
to
be
was
held
that
very
day
and
although
captain
hubbard
and
rodney
carried
their
point
it
was
only
by
a
small
majority
of
votes
that
the
rangers
consented
to
leave
their
own
state
and
go
into
the
service
of
another
believing
it
to
be
a
good
plan
to
strike
while
the
iron
was
hot
captain
hubbard
and
one
of
his
officers
at
once
set
out
for
new
orleans
to
find
a
boat
that
would
take
the
company
to
little
rock
but
in
the
meantime
the
governor
of
louisiana
got
wind
of
the
affair
through
spies
in
the
telegraph
office
in
mooreville
and
tried
to
upset
the
designs
of
the
rangers
by
having
them
sworn
in
by
general
lacey
who
was
a
confederate
officer
he
would
have
succeeded
too
had
it
not
been
for
rodney
gray
who
cautioned
his
comrades
not
to
answer
to
their
names
when
the
roll
was
called
he
did
more
when
his
own
name
was
called
he
rode
to
the
front
and
centre
and
surprised
and
angered
the
general
a
veteran
of
the
mexican
war
who
had
never
learned
to
recognize
any
organizations
outside
of
those
mentioned
in
the
army
regulations
by
stating
that
the
company
was
an
independent
one
whose
members
while
willing
and
eager
to
be
sworn
into
the
service
of
their
state
did
not
desire
to
enter
the
service
of
the
confederate
states
they
enlisted
as
partisans
and
partisans
they
wished
to
remain
upon
hearing
this
the
veteran
was
astounded
he
declared
by
the
shade
of
the
great
and
good
washington
that
he
did
not
know
what
the
country
was
coming
to
flung
the
on
the
ground
at
the
feet
of
rodney
horse
and
rode
away
in
a
huff
and
that
was
the
last
of
captain
hubbard
rangers
they
broke
ranks
then
and
there
and
never
held
a
company
meeting
afterward
the
next
morning
rodney
gray
who
was
determined
to
be
a
partisan
and
nothing
else
started
for
missouri
with
no
companion
but
his
horse
and
eventually
succeeded
in
finding
his
friend
graham
in
spite
of
all
the
efforts
that
were
made
both
by
union
men
and
rebels
to
stop
him
of
course
tom
randolph
was
happy
over
the
way
things
had
turned
out
and
one
would
think
he
ought
to
have
been
satisfied
but
he
was
not
every
one
of
the
rangers
who
voted
against
him
when
he
ran
for
second
lieutenant
made
an
enemy
of
tom
and
he
showed
it
as
often
as
the
opportunity
was
presented
he
felt
particularly
spiteful
toward
rodney
gray
whose
services
as
had
been
publicly
acknowledged
by
the
gift
of
an
elegant
sword
from
the
company
and
he
began
persecuting
him
the
moment
he
learned
that
rodney
had
decided
to
leave
the
state
and
go
to
missouri
with
the
aid
of
a
friend
of
his
drummond
by
name
who
had
charge
of
the
telegraph
office
in
mooreville
he
paved
the
way
for
rodney
arrest
in
louis
by
sending
a
description
of
him
and
his
horse
to
randolph
agent
a
yankee
cotton
factor
who
lived
in
that
city
but
this
scheme
which
might
have
brought
soldiering
to
an
end
before
it
was
fairly
begun
was
frustrated
by
a
student
in
drummond
office
whose
name
was
griffin
and
who
went
all
the
way
to
baton
rouge
by
night
to
warn
rodney
of
the
plots
that
had
been
laid
against
him
acting
on
his
friendly
hints
rodney
did
not
go
to
louis
as
he
had
intended
but
left
the
boat
at
cedar
bluff
landing
in
missouri
and
from
there
after
some
exciting
experiences
with
a
squad
of
emergency
men
who
happened
to
come
in
with
a
prisoner
during
the
night
he
set
off
across
the
country
to
find
general
price
and
dick
graham
he
had
undertaken
something
from
which
the
boldest
man
might
have
shrunk
without
any
fear
of
being
accused
of
timidity
but
he
came
through
with
flying
colors
as
we
have
said
did
a
soldier
duty
side
by
side
with
his
friend
dick
for
fifteen
dreary
months
was
discharged
with
him
at
tupelo
after
the
evacuation
of
corinth
and
brought
dick
home
with
him
to
his
father
house
at
mooreville
where
they
were
both
resting
at
the
time
this
story
begins
even
after
they
were
discharged
and
had
begun
telling
each
other
that
their
troubles
and
trials
as
soldiers
were
all
over
they
met
with
an
adventure
that
under
almost
any
other
circumstances
might
have
proved
a
serious
thing
for
them
shortly
after
they
left
camp
pinckney
on
their
way
home
they
ran
into
a
squad
of
union
troopers
who
covered
them
with
their
carbines
and
told
them
to
come
in
out
of
the
rain
they
were
prisoners
for
the
first
time
but
did
not
remain
so
any
longer
than
it
took
their
captors
to
read
their
discharges
the
boys
hearts
overflowed
with
gratitude
when
the
corporal
who
commanded
the
squad
jerked
his
thumb
over
his
shoulder
and
told
them
to
git
and
rodney
hinted
that
the
time
might
come
when
they
could
repay
his
kindness
strange
as
it
may
appear
the
time
did
come
and
perhaps
we
shall
see
if
rodney
remembered
and
kept
his
promise
rodney
gray
was
the
only
one
of
captain
hubbard
rangers
who
became
a
partisan
the
governor
attempt
to
have
them
sworn
into
the
confederate
service
against
their
will
broke
them
up
completely
and
so
disgusted
some
of
their
number
that
they
declared
they
never
wanted
to
see
a
man
with
a
star
on
his
collar
again
but
they
could
not
remain
at
home
while
all
their
friends
were
making
haste
to
go
to
the
front
for
fear
that
the
fun
would
all
be
over
and
the
yankees
whipped
before
they
could
get
there
and
in
the
end
every
one
of
them
became
what
he
repeatedly
declared
he
never
would
confederate
soldier
then
it
was
that
tom
randolph
and
his
father
began
to
bestir
themselves
there
was
a
good
deal
of
pressure
brought
to
bear
upon
every
young
man
and
boy
in
the
south
about
that
time
and
those
who
would
not
put
on
a
gray
jacket
or
do
something
else
to
show
their
zeal
for
the
cause
were
coldly
treated
and
sometimes
snubbed
but
tom
randolph
escaped
all
this
and
even
raised
himself
higher
in
the
estimation
of
some
of
the
mooreville
people
by
procuring
through
his
father
influence
a
captain
commission
in
the
state
militia
with
authority
to
recruit
a
company
of
mounted
men
who
were
to
act
as
home
guards
tom
knew
the
commission
was
coming
and
prepared
for
it
by
ordering
a
fine
uniform
and
horse
equipments
of
the
latest
and
most
expensive
pattern
not
forgetting
an
officer
sword
which
on
its
scabbard
bore
an
inscription
to
the
effect
that
the
weapon
was
presented
by
his
affectionate
relatives
and
on
the
blade
the
old
spanish
legend
draw
me
not
without
a
cause
nor
sheath
me
with
dishonor
that
is
a
good
motto
my
son
said
randolph
when
tom
drew
the
weapon
and
proudly
showed
it
as
though
his
father
had
never
seen
it
before
and
i
trust
you
will
bear
it
constantly
in
mind
the
cause
of
the
south
is
a
righteous
cause
for
it
is
the
cause
of
freedom
the
world
over
shouted
captain
randolph
pounding
the
table
with
his
fist
and
ignoring
the
fact
that
his
father
held
more
than
four
hundred
men
women
and
children
in
bondage
at
that
moment
to
cease
fighting
for
that
cause
at
the
bidding
of
the
tyrant
lincoln
would
be
dishonor
and
the
stain
upon
our
record
as
a
nation
would
be
so
deep
and
black
that
it
could
be
wiped
out
when
once
i
have
drawn
this
beautiful
sword
in
defence
of
the
of
my
country
it
shall
never
be
sheathed
until
every
yankee
south
of
mason
and
dixon
line
has
been
driven
back
where
he
belongs
the
eloquent
soldier
pounded
the
table
with
his
fist
everyone
in
the
room
negro
servants
and
all
applauded
and
one
of
the
latter
ventured
to
say
in
tones
that
of
course
were
not
intended
to
reach
the
ears
say
you
niggahs
what
you
bet
dem
yankees
do
run
fit
to
kill
derselves
when
dey
see
mass
tom
comin
as
to
tom
he
smiled
complacently
and
said
to
himself
that
was
a
better
speech
than
rodney
gray
delivered
when
those
rangers
gave
him
that
of
his
knowing
rodney
gray
and
dick
graham
as
well
as
you
ought
to
know
them
by
this
time
what
do
you
think
they
would
have
thought
if
they
had
been
in
that
room
and
listened
to
tom
words
before
twenty
minutes
had
passed
away
he
appeared
upon
the
streets
of
mooreville
in
the
full
glory
of
his
captain
suit
and
with
his
horse
duly
caparisoned
but
having
no
company
to
command
he
prudently
left
his
sword
at
home
it
was
tom
wish
and
his
father
to
bring
the
strength
of
the
company
up
to
a
hundred
men
but
tom
found
it
harder
work
to
raise
a
small
fraction
of
that
number
than
it
was
to
get
his
commission
from
the
governor
everyone
who
presented
himself
was
accepted
and
that
too
without
reference
to
his
social
standing
or
his
ability
to
pass
the
surgeon
and
when
all
other
expedients
to
promote
enlistments
had
been
tried
randolph
came
to
the
front
as
he
had
done
in
the
case
of
the
rangers
with
the
offer
to
arm
and
equip
all
recruits
who
could
not
furnish
their
own
outfit
this
helped
matters
along
amazingly
and
when
fifty
men
had
been
enrolled
captain
randolph
ordered
them
to
appear
in
one
of
his
father
fields
on
a
certain
afternoon
armed
and
equipped
as
the
law
directed
for
company
inspection
no
one
knew
just
what
the
order
meant
but
the
men
were
all
in
the
field
at
the
appointed
time
and
when
tom
came
to
look
at
them
as
they
sat
in
their
saddles
facing
him
after
making
an
awkward
and
ineffectual
effort
to
fall
in
line
he
was
disgusted
with
them
and
with
himself
too
until
that
moment
he
had
no
idea
that
he
had
been
enrolling
so
unpromising
a
body
of
men
they
looked
more
like
lazy
vagabonds
as
indeed
the
most
of
them
were
rodney
gray
himself
could
not
have
made
soldiers
of
them
the
next
half
hour
was
an
ordeal
that
captain
tom
never
wanted
to
pass
through
again
but
we
will
let
him
describe
it
in
his
own
way
they
were
the
worst
looking
fellows
i
think
i
ever
saw
tom
told
his
father
and
mother
when
he
reached
home
after
the
inspection
was
over
i
brought
them
together
because
i
wanted
to
see
how
they
looked
and
how
i
would
look
riding
at
their
head
and
to
tell
the
honest
truth
if
a
stranger
had
come
into
that
field
when
they
first
tried
to
draw
themselves
up
in
line
i
believe
i
should
have
put
spurs
to
my
horse
and
galloped
away
rather
than
be
seen
in
their
company
why
what
was
the
matter
with
them
inquired
his
mother
who
took
as
deep
an
interest
in
the
organization
as
tom
himself
and
was
anxious
that
it
should
win
a
name
for
him
after
the
rebuff
he
had
received
at
the
hands
of
captain
hubbard
rangers
you
knew
they
were
not
gentlemen
when
you
asked
them
to
give
in
their
names
there
are
few
of
that
sort
left
in
the
country
more
the
pity
i
know
that
but
i
hoped
they
might
have
pride
enough
to
make
a
respectable
appearance
at
inspection
answered
captain
tom
in
the
first
place
no
two
of
them
were
mounted
armed
or
dressed
alike
in
the
next
they
came
just
as
they
had
been
at
work
in
the
field
in
the
forenoon
and
i
do
believe
that
half
of
them
had
taken
the
trouble
to
wash
their
faces
or
comb
their
hair
they
looked
just
as
we
see
them
on
the
streets
every
day
i
suppose
said
randolph
just
the
same
only
worse
replied
tom
who
was
almost
mad
enough
to
cry
every
time
he
thought
of
it
here
was
a
man
mounted
on
the
heaviest
kind
of
a
plough
horse
and
carrying
a
long
squirrel
rifle
on
his
shoulder
and
beside
him
was
one
on
a
little
runt
of
a
mule
and
armed
with
a
heavy
not
a
few
of
them
had
chicken
or
turkey
feathers
stuck
in
their
slouch
hats
for
plumes
and
some
had
pipes
in
their
mouths
and
when
i
said
that
no
smoking
would
be
allowed
in
the
ranks
they
did
not
hesitate
to
tell
me
that
i
need
not
think
i
could
boss
them
around
as
rodney
gray
had
bossed
the
rangers
while
he
was
acting
as
their
for
that
was
something
they
would
not
submit
to
why
impudence
exclaimed
randolph
while
her
husband
looked
down
at
the
floor
and
told
himself
that
that
was
about
what
might
have
been
expected
of
such
men
as
he
and
tom
had
been
able
to
bring
into
the
home
guards
that
the
kind
of
soldiers
they
are
continued
captain
tom
they
know
i
have
the
power
to
enforce
my
commands
and
so
they
intend
to
do
pretty
near
as
they
please
the
only
reason
they
joined
was
because
they
wanted
an
excuse
for
keeping
out
of
the
army
and
get
the
horses
and
weapons
that
were
promised
them
and
food
added
randolph
food
exclaimed
her
husband
i
did
promise
them
any
food
except
in
case
they
were
ordered
to
some
other
part
of
the
state
and
then
i
said
i
would
look
out
for
the
families
of
those
who
were
too
poor
to
make
provision
for
them
well
a
rough
looking
fellow
who
said
he
was
a
member
of
the
company
came
to
the
kitchen
yesterday
and
asked
for
some
bacon
on
the
strength
of
that
promise
and
i
gave
it
to
him
said
randolph
i
bet
he
played
a
game
on
you
said
captain
tom
that
a
pretty
state
of
affairs
exclaimed
the
father
profoundly
astonished
do
give
another
mouthful
to
him
or
anybody
else
on
the
strength
of
promises
i
made
to
that
company
as
long
as
they
stay
about
here
they
will
earn
their
own
food
or
go
hungry
that
the
kind
of
soldiers
they
are
repeated
tom
they
enlisted
because
they
are
afraid
to
go
into
the
army
and
too
lazy
to
work
and
not
because
they
care
a
picayune
for
the
confederacy
and
after
i
had
brought
them
in
line
as
well
as
i
could
and
told
one
man
to
take
his
pants
out
of
his
boots
and
be
sure
that
those
boots
were
blacked
the
next
time
he
came
out
to
inspection
and
ordered
another
to
put
his
hat
on
straight
and
quit
carrying
his
gun
flat
on
his
shoulder
as
he
would
if
he
were
hog
hunting
in
the
woods
they
made
up
their
minds
that
they
would
elect
officers
when
i
told
them
that
i
had
brought
them
together
for
any
such
purpose
and
that
we
would
postpone
the
matter
until
the
company
had
been
brought
up
to
its
full
strength
they
pay
the
least
attention
to
me
it
a
mob
and
nothing
else
cried
randolph
who
looked
as
angry
as
her
son
felt
it
is
the
one
wish
of
my
heart
to
see
you
take
a
proud
position
among
the
noble
defenders
of
your
country
but
you
will
never
have
anything
more
to
do
with
those
ruffians
with
my
consent
whom
did
they
choose
for
officers
tom
mentioned
the
names
of
two
of
the
meanest
men
in
the
country
for
miles
around
and
his
angry
mother
continued
a
common
overseer
and
an
acknowledged
chicken
and
hog
thief
my
son
you
must
not
appear
again
in
the
company
of
those
men
i
do
intend
to
replied
tom
jumping
to
his
feet
and
striding
up
and
down
the
room
although
i
despise
every
man
in
captain
company
and
have
ever
since
they
defeated
me
for
the
second
lieutenancy
i
must
acknowledge
that
they
were
a
fine
looking
body
of
men
and
i
somehow
got
it
into
my
head
that
my
home
guards
would
look
and
act
just
like
them
but
they
do
and
i
am
so
disappointed
that
i
do
see
how
i
can
ever
get
over
it
i
hold
fast
to
my
commission
and
rank
but
i
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
that
company
of
home
guards
slowly
and
sadly
captain
tom
ascended
to
his
room
where
he
took
off
his
fine
uniform
and
arrayed
himself
in
the
citizen
suit
he
had
vowed
never
to
put
on
again
until
he
had
helped
the
south
gain
her
independence
then
he
put
his
handsome
sword
into
its
cloth
case
stood
it
up
in
the
darkest
corner
of
his
closet
and
closed
the
door
he
felt
like
a
monarch
who
had
lost
his
crown
chapter
ii
captain
tom
smells
powder
for
a
long
time
captain
randolph
remained
firm
in
his
resolution
to
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
the
home
guards
although
he
did
not
formally
throw
up
his
command
of
the
company
he
kept
away
from
it
as
much
as
he
could
and
never
ordered
it
to
appear
for
drills
and
inspections
but
by
so
doing
he
did
not
by
any
means
escape
being
taken
to
task
for
the
lawless
acts
of
which
his
men
were
guilty
the
company
well
deserved
the
name
that
randolph
had
applied
to
it
and
one
could
not
reasonably
expect
that
they
would
conduct
themselves
as
the
mooreville
rangers
would
have
done
under
the
same
circumstances
it
had
never
occurred
to
them
to
inquire
what
their
duties
would
be
when
they
were
sworn
into
the
service
of
the
state
and
it
is
extremely
doubtful
if
their
captain
could
have
enlightened
them
on
that
point
but
in
their
ignorance
they
took
it
for
granted
that
they
had
been
given
liberty
to
do
as
they
pleased
and
acting
under
the
leadership
of
their
lieutenants
lambert
the
overseer
and
moseley
the
chicken
and
hog
thief
they
very
soon
made
themselves
known
to
and
feared
and
hated
by
the
citizens
for
miles
around
tom
heard
of
their
exploits
now
and
then
and
although
he
stamped
his
feet
and
shook
his
clenched
hands
in
the
air
he
did
nothing
to
show
his
authority
at
last
things
came
to
such
a
pass
that
captain
tom
to
quote
from
rodney
friend
griffin
who
was
closely
watching
the
movements
of
the
home
guards
had
to
fish
or
cut
bait
bright
and
early
one
morning
a
couple
of
angry
planters
galloped
furiously
into
randolph
front
yard
threw
themselves
from
their
horses
leaving
the
animals
to
tramp
down
the
flower
beds
or
stand
still
as
they
pleased
entered
the
house
without
knocking
and
made
their
way
through
the
hall
into
the
dining
room
where
the
family
sat
at
breakfast
without
giving
anybody
time
to
express
surprise
at
their
abrupt
entrance
or
to
inquire
into
the
nature
of
their
business
they
stalked
around
the
table
to
the
chair
in
which
tom
was
sitting
and
shook
their
fists
in
his
face
pretty
close
to
his
nose
young
feller
said
the
one
whose
rage
would
permit
him
to
speak
first
what
do
you
mean
by
sending
them
vagabonds
of
yourn
them
home
guards
into
gentlemen
houses
to
turn
things
up
the
men
looked
so
dangerous
that
captain
tom
turned
white
with
alarm
but
could
not
utter
a
word
he
understood
the
charge
and
knew
he
was
innocent
but
he
could
not
say
so
when
that
company
of
yourn
was
first
got
together
you
took
pains
to
spread
it
around
that
you
were
going
to
use
them
to
clean
out
the
union
men
the
planter
almost
shouted
that
was
all
right
and
i
did
have
a
word
to
say
against
it
for
i
thought
they
oughter
be
driven
out
but
why
do
you
confine
yourselves
to
searching
the
houses
of
union
men
and
let
good
and
loyal
confederates
like
me
and
my
neighbor
alone
we
are
as
strong
for
the
south
and
as
ready
to
fight
for
her
as
you
are
and
i
tell
you
once
for
by
this
time
tom
father
and
mother
had
recovered
themselves
in
some
measure
but
tom
himself
was
still
so
frightened
that
he
could
not
speak
the
former
arose
and
placed
chairs
for
the
visitors
and
randolph
told
the
girl
to
lay
plates
for
them
adding
that
if
they
would
sit
down
and
tell
their
story
while
drinking
a
cup
of
coffee
she
was
sure
her
son
could
clear
himself
of
the
serious
accusations
they
had
brought
against
him
if
their
houses
had
been
raided
by
the
home
guards
they
might
rest
assured
that
a
randolph
was
in
no
way
to
blame
for
it
this
calmed
the
storm
and
made
the
visitors
look
as
though
they
felt
a
little
ashamed
of
themselves
but
they
sat
down
and
told
their
story
it
seems
that
that
man
lambert
who
always
was
too
lazy
and
trifling
to
earn
an
honest
living
has
give
up
his
situation
as
overseer
on
miss
randall
place
and
took
to
raiding
through
the
country
on
his
own
hook
said
the
planter
who
had
thus
far
done
all
the
talking
we
have
heard
of
him
a
time
or
two
but
so
long
as
he
stole
from
union
men
and
pestered
them
it
was
all
right
but
last
night
he
jumped
down
on
me
and
boswell
and
that
is
a
little
more
than
we
can
stand
i
do
see
what
made
him
do
that
exclaimed
tom
who
had
by
this
time
found
his
tongue
he
knows
you
are
good
confederates
of
course
he
knows
it
and
when
we
reminded
him
of
it
he
did
try
to
deny
it
but
he
allowed
we
had
guns
in
the
house
and
that
them
dangerous
things
could
be
permitted
to
stay
in
the
country
except
in
the
hands
of
soldiers
so
he
came
to
our
houses
and
searched
them
and
as
he
had
about
a
dozen
men
in
his
gang
we
could
help
ourselves
as
sure
as
i
live
i
never
gave
him
orders
to
search
premises
declared
tom
i
do
reckon
you
ever
gave
him
much
orders
of
any
sort
replied
the
planter
with
a
look
on
his
face
which
showed
that
he
knew
about
how
much
authority
tom
had
over
the
home
guards
and
bear
this
in
mind
added
his
companion
when
we
found
that
we
could
say
or
do
anything
to
stop
them
and
that
they
were
dead
set
on
having
the
guns
we
offered
to
bring
out
ruther
than
have
them
dirty
vagabonds
rummaging
over
our
things
but
that
did
by
no
means
suit
lambert
him
and
his
men
must
go
in
themselves
so
as
to
be
sure
of
getting
everything
in
the
shape
of
weapons
there
was
and
when
they
got
into
my
house
where
do
you
suppose
was
the
first
place
they
went
to
added
boswell
with
suppressed
fury
i
have
not
the
slightest
idea
replied
randolph
when
the
man
stopped
and
looked
around
as
if
he
expected
an
answer
to
the
bed
said
tom
who
had
heard
that
it
was
a
good
plan
for
raiders
to
look
between
mattresses
for
things
they
wanted
to
find
no
they
did
they
went
straight
to
my
wife
bureau
said
boswell
fiercely
that
was
a
pretty
place
to
look
for
guns
was
it
now
tom
was
thunderstruck
he
knew
that
the
home
guards
had
been
denounced
as
robbers
because
they
had
ransacked
the
dwellings
and
of
union
men
and
had
thought
nothing
of
it
for
union
men
had
no
rights
and
were
not
in
the
least
deserving
of
sympathy
but
this
was
a
different
matter
altogether
it
would
never
do
to
let
such
a
story
as
that
get
to
the
ears
of
the
governor
perhaps
they
looked
into
the
bureau
for
revolvers
he
managed
to
say
at
length
no
they
did
they
looked
for
rings
and
breastpins
and
bracelets
and
the
like
but
they
did
find
none
for
my
wife
was
sharp
enough
to
put
the
whole
business
into
her
pocket
as
soon
as
she
see
that
they
were
set
on
coming
into
the
house
all
the
same
they
got
a
rifle
that
cost
me
in
gold
in
new
orleans
in
good
times
and
a
shot
gun
that
is
worth
almost
twice
as
much
and
i
tell
you
what
a
fact
tom
randolph
i
want
them
guns
back
they
mine
and
if
i
do
get
i
raise
a
fuss
and
while
you
are
getting
them
you
might
as
well
tell
lambert
to
hand
over
the
two
guns
he
stole
from
me
said
the
other
visitor
and
that
if
he
ever
pokes
his
long
nose
inside
my
door
again
i
send
the
contents
of
one
of
into
it
i
say
nothing
about
the
hams
they
took
from
my
smoke
house
but
they
must
try
to
take
any
more
i
reckon
me
and
boswell
were
a
little
too
fast
in
accusing
you
of
sending
lambert
to
search
our
houses
but
you
being
the
captain
you
know
you
had
oughter
make
them
fellers
go
a
little
slower
what
do
you
think
of
the
situation
anyhow
randolph
and
how
long
will
it
be
before
we
shall
have
washington
randolph
and
his
wife
were
glad
to
have
the
conversation
turned
into
another
channel
and
so
was
captain
tom
who
did
not
want
to
hear
any
more
about
lieutenant
lambert
and
his
exploits
he
was
ill
at
ease
as
long
as
the
visitors
remained
but
they
went
away
as
soon
as
they
had
drunk
their
coffee
and
seemed
as
glad
to
go
as
the
randolphs
were
to
have
them
tom
did
not
eat
a
hearty
breakfast
that
morning
for
the
fear
that
the
governor
might
get
wind
of
lambert
latest
raid
and
revoke
his
commission
added
to
the
difficulties
he
saw
in
his
way
of
complying
with
the
demands
his
late
visitors
had
made
upon
him
took
away
his
appetite
he
must
restore
those
guns
to
their
were
no
two
ways
about
that
but
how
should
he
go
to
work
to
get
them
his
first
thought
was
to
present
himself
before
lambert
in
full
uniform
and
by
virtue
of
the
authority
conferred
upon
him
by
his
commission
which
stated
in
plain
language
that
he
was
to
be
obeyed
by
all
persons
under
him
demand
the
return
of
the
stolen
property
forthwith
that
was
the
way
any
other
captain
would
have
gone
about
it
tom
thought
but
he
was
afraid
that
bluster
might
not
prove
successful
in
his
case
he
had
reason
to
fear
and
it
was
one
of
the
heaviest
trials
he
was
called
upon
to
bear
that
he
did
not
stand
as
high
in
the
estimation
of
some
of
his
men
as
he
did
in
his
mother
that
he
had
on
one
or
two
occasions
been
compared
to
a
wagon
fifth
wheel
in
point
of
usefulness
and
it
would
be
just
like
the
insubordinate
lambert
to
refuse
point
blank
to
obey
his
orders
that
would
be
unfortunate
for
it
would
show
to
the
world
and
perhaps
to
the
governor
that
tom
was
not
the
real
captain
of
the
home
guards
after
looking
at
the
matter
from
all
sides
he
made
up
his
mind
that
conciliation
would
be
his
best
policy
and
when
he
rode
away
to
seek
an
interview
with
his
lieutenant
he
wore
citizen
clothes
and
left
his
sword
behind
he
found
lambert
at
his
quarters
on
the
randall
plantation
where
he
continued
to
live
although
he
had
turned
the
work
over
to
the
field
hands
and
seldom
took
the
trouble
to
see
how
it
was
going
on
and
he
was
just
getting
ready
to
mount
the
horse
that
had
been
brought
to
his
door
hallo
lieutenant
began
tom
with
more
familiarity
and
than
he
had
ever
before
exhibited
in
addressing
the
man
morning
replied
the
overseer
who
might
have
responded
to
the
salutation
in
a
very
different
way
if
tom
had
not
been
respectful
enough
to
put
a
handle
to
his
name
want
to
see
me
i
came
over
on
purpose
to
have
a
friendly
talk
with
you
said
tom
look
here
old
fellow
you
will
play
smash
if
you
do
stop
raiding
the
premises
of
such
men
as
boswell
and
wallace
what
induced
you
to
do
it
aint
i
got
a
right
to
look
for
demanded
lambert
you
have
authority
from
me
answered
tom
with
some
emphasis
on
the
two
last
words
to
search
the
houses
of
union
men
but
you
have
no
right
to
enter
the
dwellings
of
confederates
i
knowed
that
them
two
men
had
guns
in
hiding
but
you
did
expect
to
find
them
in
bureau
drawers
did
you
eh
exclaimed
the
overseer
he
looked
somewhat
abashed
for
a
moment
and
then
continued
when
i
search
a
house
i
search
it
i
look
into
every
hole
and
corner
in
it
that
is
perfectly
right
when
you
search
houses
belonging
to
the
enemies
of
your
country
but
it
is
all
wrong
when
you
enter
the
houses
of
our
friends
such
work
will
turn
them
against
enemies
of
them
i
saw
boswell
and
wallace
this
morning
and
they
are
mad
as
hornets
they
want
their
guns
back
well
the
next
time
you
see
just
ask
if
they
have
now
or
wait
till
they
get
i
want
them
guns
myself
to
keep
the
yankees
from
getting
the
yankees
said
tom
contemptuously
you
do
think
they
will
ever
get
this
far
south
do
you
they
mout
did
you
say
yourself
that
they
was
liable
to
come
down
from
cairo
or
up
from
new
orleans
and
that
we
oughter
have
a
company
of
home
guards
here
to
stop
i
said
there
was
a
bare
possibility
that
they
might
do
so
and
that
it
would
be
the
part
of
wisdom
to
prepare
for
an
emergency
answered
captain
tom
who
well
remembered
that
he
had
used
stronger
language
than
that
while
urging
lambert
to
send
in
his
name
but
i
want
those
guns
and
must
have
them
at
once
you
have
any
commission
from
the
governor
yet
and
when
tom
said
this
he
stopped
abruptly
and
gave
such
a
start
that
his
lieutenant
looked
up
at
him
in
surprise
what
the
matter
said
he
you
what
you
have
received
your
commission
from
the
governor
yet
repeated
tom
slowly
and
emphatically
and
when
have
i
got
to
have
a
paper
like
yourn
exclaimed
lambert
looking
astonished
and
interested
that
news
to
me
yes
and
it
can
come
to
you
only
through
my
recommendation
i
must
certify
that
you
were
legally
elected
to
the
office
you
hold
and
that
was
the
reason
i
did
not
want
you
men
to
go
through
the
farce
of
holding
an
election
on
horseback
on
the
day
i
ordered
you
out
for
inspection
replied
tom
but
the
truth
was
he
had
never
thought
of
it
until
that
moment
it
was
a
bright
idea
that
suddenly
flitted
through
his
mind
and
he
wondered
why
it
had
been
so
long
in
coming
to
him
well
by
gum
was
all
the
disgusted
lambert
could
say
in
reply
your
papers
if
you
get
them
will
be
something
like
mine
only
different
you
know
for
a
captain
outranks
a
lieutenant
by
a
large
majority
continued
tom
improving
to
the
utmost
the
advantage
he
had
so
unexpectedly
gained
you
have
no
authority
to
make
out
warrants
but
i
have
and
our
if
we
had
any
would
have
to
look
to
me
for
them
this
was
all
greek
to
the
overseer
who
had
taken
no
pains
to
post
himself
on
military
matters
but
he
did
not
ask
tom
to
explain
for
he
was
anxious
to
hear
more
about
the
commission
he
ought
to
have
but
had
not
yet
received
well
go
on
said
he
impatiently
and
when
you
what
and
when
i
make
my
first
report
to
the
governor
or
his
and
ask
him
about
your
commission
and
moseley
i
want
to
be
able
to
say
that
you
are
in
every
way
satisfactory
to
me
as
well
as
to
the
people
hereabouts
and
that
i
am
sure
you
will
make
brave
and
obedient
officers
but
you
can
see
for
yourself
that
i
say
that
if
you
keep
on
bothering
good
and
loyal
confederates
like
wallace
and
boswell
i
think
you
had
better
give
me
those
guns
i
aint
got
but
one
replied
lambert
who
seemed
to
have
lost
the
independent
and
swaggering
air
he
had
assumed
at
the
beginning
of
the
interview
and
i
go
right
in
and
bring
it
out
where
are
the
others
demanded
captain
tom
well
moseley
got
one
smith
got
another
and
where
one
has
went
i
disremember
just
at
this
minute
you
distributed
the
spoils
among
you
it
seems
yes
kinder
the
yankees
could
easy
find
them
then
you
must
ride
around
and
gather
them
up
and
as
i
have
nothing
particular
to
do
this
morning
i
will
go
with
you
i
rather
be
a
king
among
hogs
than
a
hog
among
kings
any
day
said
tom
to
himself
as
his
lieutenant
turned
about
and
went
into
his
house
but
i
confess
i
little
thought
i
should
get
so
low
down
as
to
command
a
lot
of
brigands
that
idea
about
the
commissions
makes
me
the
biggest
toad
in
the
puddle
from
this
time
on
i
hold
them
up
as
prospective
rewards
for
good
behavior
and
prompt
obedience
of
orders
but
lambert
and
moseley
shall
never
have
commissions
on
my
recommendation
i
bet
you
the
home
guards
had
deliberately
stolen
these
four
valuable
guns
and
tom
randolph
knew
it
as
soon
as
he
found
how
they
had
been
scattered
about
the
plea
that
if
permitted
to
remain
in
possession
of
their
owners
they
might
be
captured
by
the
yankees
who
would
use
them
to
kill
confederates
was
lambert
excuse
for
one
of
the
worst
outrages
that
had
ever
been
perpetrated
in
that
part
of
louisiana
but
it
was
by
no
means
the
last
of
all
the
home
guards
in
the
south
were
like
captain
tom
men
and
the
worst
that
can
be
said
of
them
is
that
they
acted
as
guards
at
andersonville
libby
millen
and
salisbury
it
was
not
the
confederate
soldiers
who
served
at
the
front
but
the
home
guards
who
starved
the
boys
in
blue
to
death
in
those
prison
pens
and
hunted
them
with
bloodhounds
when
they
escaped
the
upshot
of
the
whole
matter
was
that
tom
got
the
guns
which
in
due
time
were
restored
to
their
lawful
owners
and
plumed
himself
on
having
firmly
established
his
authority
over
his
men
well
they
did
behave
a
little
better
during
the
daytime
and
in
that
settlement
where
they
were
so
well
known
but
they
took
to
riding
around
of
nights
and
making
visits
of
ceremony
to
isolated
farmhouses
in
which
they
had
reason
to
suppose
that
they
would
find
something
worth
stealing
but
riding
was
anything
but
easy
work
and
the
novelty
of
frightening
women
and
children
and
browbeating
unarmed
men
wore
off
after
a
while
and
when
they
had
secured
bacon
and
meal
enough
to
last
them
for
a
few
weeks
the
home
guards
subsided
and
were
seldom
heard
of
again
until
the
news
of
the
glorious
victory
at
bull
run
raised
the
war
spirit
of
the
southern
people
to
the
old
fever
heat
then
they
came
to
the
surface
again
and
persecuted
union
people
in
and
around
mooreville
so
fiercely
that
some
of
them
were
compelled
to
flee
for
their
lives
captain
randolph
being
in
command
this
time
from
his
friend
drummond
the
telegraph
operator
he
secured
a
list
of
all
suspected
persons
in
the
neighborhood
and
with
this
to
aid
him
tom
succeeded
in
doing
effective
work
for
the
cause
of
southern
independence
but
it
was
too
much
like
labor
to
be
kept
up
for
any
length
of
time
there
was
not
very
much
glory
in
it
anyway
the
better
class
of
secessionists
in
the
community
became
strongly
opposed
to
it
and
so
the
home
guards
dropped
out
of
sight
once
more
not
to
appear
again
until
farragut
captured
new
orleans
and
sent
some
of
his
vessels
up
the
river
to
effect
a
junction
with
davis
at
vicksburg
when
the
people
of
mooreville
heard
of
it
they
were
very
indignant
and
some
of
them
declared
that
they
would
never
submit
to
have
their
country
overrun
in
that
would
die
first
and
to
show
how
very
much
in
earnest
they
were
they
stopped
all
work
shut
up
their
houses
and
ran
about
the
streets
in
the
greatest
excitement
when
the
ship
of
war
came
up
with
commander
palmer
on
board
and
demanded
the
surrender
of
baton
rouge
the
mayor
of
that
insignificant
little
town
indulged
in
the
same
nonsense
that
the
mayor
and
council
of
new
orleans
had
been
indulging
in
the
week
before
he
declared
that
the
city
would
not
be
surrendered
to
any
power
on
earth
and
that
if
the
federals
took
possession
of
it
they
would
do
it
without
the
consent
and
against
the
wishes
of
the
peaceable
inhabitants
it
was
all
done
for
effect
and
that
man
will
be
one
of
the
last
in
the
confederacy
to
shoulder
a
musket
said
rodney
gray
when
he
heard
of
it
but
being
a
soldier
he
applauded
the
action
of
captain
palmer
who
without
any
fuss
or
parade
promptly
took
possession
of
the
barracks
arsenal
and
other
property
of
the
united
states
he
hoisted
the
flag
of
the
union
over
the
arsenal
too
and
told
the
boastful
mayor
in
pretty
plain
language
that
he
would
let
it
stay
there
if
he
did
not
want
to
get
himself
and
his
town
into
trouble
all
honor
to
the
brave
citizens
of
new
orleans
they
have
shown
me
how
i
ought
to
act
in
this
emergency
said
captain
randolph
on
the
morning
the
startling
news
came
that
some
of
the
victorious
union
fleet
had
steamed
up
the
river
he
posted
for
his
room
the
moment
he
heard
of
it
and
when
he
came
down
he
was
dressed
in
his
uniform
and
wore
his
glittering
sword
by
his
side
now
take
those
things
off
and
do
make
a
fool
of
yourself
said
randolph
who
had
told
his
wife
over
and
over
again
that
from
the
bottom
of
his
heart
he
wished
he
had
never
had
anything
to
do
with
the
home
guards
do
be
rash
my
dear
said
his
mother
in
tones
more
befitting
the
occasion
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
shall
assemble
my
company
and
place
myself
in
a
strong
position
between
here
and
baton
rouge
and
stand
ready
to
resist
the
advance
upon
mooreville
replied
tom
the
federal
general
butler
has
more
than
men
and
can
easily
spare
some
of
them
long
enough
to
make
our
capital
a
heap
of
ashes
but
the
governor
shall
hear
that
i
harassed
them
while
they
were
doing
it
as
our
own
marion
and
his
bold
men
used
to
harass
the
redcoats
those
who
were
best
acquainted
with
tom
randolph
knew
that
he
would
not
have
gone
one
step
toward
baton
rouge
if
he
had
not
had
the
best
of
reasons
for
believing
that
there
were
no
troops
at
hand
to
take
possession
of
the
city
after
the
war
ships
had
captured
it
but
although
tom
hinted
as
much
to
the
members
of
his
company
whom
he
tried
to
rally
to
the
defence
of
their
he
could
not
induce
more
than
a
handful
of
them
to
turn
out
it
did
not
require
very
much
courage
to
rob
union
men
who
had
previously
been
deprived
of
their
weapons
but
facing
who
were
likely
to
have
loaded
muskets
in
their
hands
was
a
more
serious
matter
the
excuses
the
home
guards
made
for
refusing
to
follow
their
captain
were
of
the
flimsiest
kind
but
all
the
same
they
would
go
and
tom
finally
rode
away
with
only
a
baker
dozen
of
men
at
his
heels
they
arrived
within
sight
of
the
spires
of
the
city
on
the
same
day
that
captain
sailors
hoisted
the
union
flag
over
the
arsenal
and
might
perhaps
have
witnessed
the
ceremony
if
they
had
gone
a
mile
or
two
farther
down
the
road
but
captain
tom
could
not
uncover
mooreville
even
for
the
sake
of
saving
the
capital
of
his
state
he
did
not
even
venture
near
enough
to
the
mississippi
to
see
the
topmasts
but
he
went
closer
to
the
enemy
than
the
cowards
who
remained
at
home
and
that
was
something
to
be
proud
of
captain
tom
slept
in
a
planter
house
that
night
while
his
men
bunked
in
the
stables
and
corn
cribs
and
under
the
trees
in
the
yard
and
the
next
morning
made
a
wide
detour
to
the
river
above
the
city
with
no
other
object
in
view
than
to
be
able
to
say
when
he
went
home
that
he
had
been
there
if
he
had
known
what
he
was
going
to
see
and
experience
when
he
reached
the
river
it
is
likely
that
he
would
have
gone
in
that
direction
at
all
for
he
halted
his
men
behind
the
levee
just
in
time
to
see
a
monster
war
vessel
steaming
leisurely
up
the
swift
muddy
current
of
the
mississippi
she
was
the
blackest
ugliest
looking
thing
that
tom
eyes
had
ever
rested
on
and
the
queerest
sensations
came
over
him
as
he
gazed
at
her
it
was
not
a
cold
day
but
tom
shivered
violently
and
tasted
something
in
his
mouth
that
reminded
him
of
salt
by
gum
there
one
of
them
things
now
let
try
a
whack
at
her
what
do
you
say
boys
tom
had
been
on
the
point
of
giving
the
signal
for
retreat
or
trying
to
give
it
but
this
astounding
and
reckless
proposition
staggered
him
so
that
he
could
not
open
his
mouth
the
man
who
made
it
showed
that
he
was
in
earnest
by
swinging
himself
from
his
horse
and
advancing
on
all
fours
toward
the
levee
dragging
his
rifle
along
the
ground
at
his
side
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
it
he
and
all
his
companions
were
lying
prone
behind
the
levee
using
it
as
a
breastwork
and
captain
tom
sat
in
his
saddle
looking
on
like
one
in
a
dream
when
they
were
all
in
position
one
of
the
home
guards
set
up
a
warwhoop
a
straggling
fire
ran
along
the
top
of
the
levee
and
bullets
and
buckshot
went
whistling
toward
the
vessel
there
were
several
men
on
her
deck
and
around
the
and
although
tom
did
not
see
any
of
them
fall
he
did
see
that
they
were
badly
frightened
for
they
ran
in
all
directions
and
an
instant
later
there
was
not
one
of
them
to
be
seen
the
home
guards
yelled
triumphantly
and
turned
on
their
backs
behind
their
breastwork
to
reload
their
guns
then
tom
managed
to
find
his
voice
but
it
sounded
so
strangely
that
he
hardly
knew
whether
it
belonged
to
him
or
not
that
the
way
to
make
the
yankees
hunt
their
holes
he
said
in
trembling
tones
give
it
to
them
again
cut
their
old
tub
to
pieces
my
just
then
a
wide
dark
opening
appeared
in
the
side
of
the
vessel
nearest
them
a
black
object
came
slowly
out
a
thundering
concussion
rent
the
air
and
a
pound
shell
came
at
them
it
shrieked
fearfully
as
it
flew
over
the
levee
above
their
heads
and
made
such
a
horrid
din
when
it
exploded
in
the
thick
woods
behind
them
scattering
iron
and
branches
about
and
cutting
down
twigs
and
leaves
in
a
perfect
shower
that
for
a
single
instant
the
home
guards
were
motionless
with
astonishment
and
terror
they
had
not
hurt
the
gunboat
at
all
but
they
had
made
her
captain
angry
and
the
fear
that
he
might
resent
the
insult
to
his
flag
by
firing
more
shells
at
them
sent
the
home
guards
to
their
saddles
in
hot
haste
and
with
captain
tom
who
rode
the
swiftest
horse
far
in
the
lead
they
struck
out
for
home
at
a
better
pace
than
they
had
ever
travelled
before
and
they
never
drew
rein
until
they
had
left
the
dangerous
neighborhood
miles
behind
it
was
the
narrowest
escape
from
an
ambuscade
i
ever
had
in
my
life
said
captain
tom
to
the
first
man
he
met
when
he
rode
into
mooreville
that
night
and
if
it
had
been
for
my
promptness
in
getting
out
of
there
i
should
have
had
a
man
left
we
have
been
cut
to
pieces
or
captured
the
last
one
of
us
we
did
see
any
enemy
except
the
ship
we
fired
at
but
a
minute
or
so
after
she
opened
on
us
a
battery
of
flying
artillery
that
had
all
the
while
been
concealed
in
the
timber
in
our
rear
cut
loose
on
us
with
all
its
guns
and
it
a
miracle
that
one
of
us
escaped
to
tell
the
story
of
the
battle
but
my
partner
came
from
baton
rouge
said
the
man
doubtfully
and
he
declares
that
there
are
no
yankee
troops
in
the
country
this
side
of
new
orleans
so
where
did
that
battery
come
from
do
you
believe
any
such
stuff
replied
tom
indignantly
i
tell
you
the
woods
are
full
of
them
and
they
are
liable
to
come
to
mooreville
between
now
and
sunrise
if
no
one
else
believed
his
story
tom
believed
it
himself
and
the
consequence
was
he
slept
in
his
chair
that
night
but
for
some
reason
the
yankees
did
not
appear
as
he
had
predicted
and
they
might
have
postponed
their
coming
indefinitely
had
it
not
been
for
the
lawless
acts
of
captain
tom
own
men
chapter
iii
the
conscript
friend
tom
randolph
would
have
been
very
angry
indeed
if
anyone
had
told
him
that
the
noise
that
pound
shell
made
when
it
exploded
in
the
woods
and
led
him
and
his
men
to
believe
that
there
was
a
union
battery
concealed
there
had
frightened
all
the
war
spirit
out
of
him
but
it
is
a
fact
that
after
his
experience
with
the
gunboat
he
did
not
show
the
least
desire
to
take
the
field
again
at
the
head
of
his
company
everybody
knew
that
there
were
no
federal
troops
in
baton
rouge
but
there
were
war
vessels
in
the
mississippi
holding
the
city
under
their
guns
and
their
presence
had
a
depressing
effect
upon
a
good
many
rebels
besides
tom
randolph
more
than
that
general
butler
had
assumed
command
at
new
orleans
and
the
energetic
and
effective
way
in
which
he
dealt
with
treason
there
opened
the
eyes
of
the
mooreville
people
to
the
fact
that
there
might
be
a
day
of
settlement
coming
for
them
also
and
that
it
would
be
well
if
they
could
have
a
tolerably
clean
record
to
show
when
the
invading
army
moved
up
to
take
possession
of
baton
rouge
this
was
the
way
randolph
and
some
of
his
neighbors
looked
at
the
situation
and
acting
upon
the
hints
they
dropped
in
his
presence
tom
concealed
his
uniform
and
sword
in
the
garret
where
he
thought
no
one
would
be
likely
to
look
for
them
he
was
getting
tired
of
war
anyway
he
said
and
wished
the
past
could
be
blotted
out
and
things
be
as
they
were
before
south
carolina
by
her
senseless
act
of
secession
brought
so
much
trouble
upon
him
and
his
friends
he
was
not
as
disgusted
and
angry
as
a
good
confederate
ought
to
have
been
when
he
heard
a
man
from
baton
rouge
affirm
that
after
all
the
yankees
were
not
such
a
bad
sort
when
one
became
acquainted
with
them
and
that
some
of
the
were
not
ashamed
to
confess
to
a
friendly
feeling
for
the
crews
of
the
gunboats
that
were
anchored
in
front
of
the
city
the
always
acted
like
gentlemen
when
they
came
ashore
and
true
to
their
instincts
of
traffic
had
established
a
lively
little
trade
with
the
citizens
they
purchased
everything
the
latter
had
to
sell
in
the
way
of
milk
butter
and
eggs
and
paid
for
all
they
got
in
good
money
or
what
was
better
in
coffee
tea
store
tea
too
and
not
sassafras
wheat
flour
and
salt
it
is
true
that
the
salt
was
not
as
fine
nor
as
clean
as
some
they
had
seen
for
it
had
been
taken
from
the
brine
of
the
beef
and
pork
barrels
with
which
the
of
the
gunboats
were
abundantly
supplied
but
it
was
acceptable
to
people
who
had
boiled
down
the
dirt
floors
of
their
in
order
to
get
the
salt
that
had
trickled
off
the
hams
and
sides
of
bacon
which
had
been
cured
there
in
better
times
the
gunboat
officers
also
sent
their
soiled
linen
ashore
to
be
washed
so
that
not
a
day
passed
during
which
there
was
not
more
or
less
communication
with
the
fleet
this
was
a
pleasant
state
of
affairs
all
around
especially
to
the
victorious
who
had
grown
tired
of
fighting
and
wanted
all
the
shore
liberty
they
could
get
and
it
might
have
continued
until
the
confederate
general
breckenridge
made
his
unsuccessful
attempt
to
regain
control
of
the
mississippi
above
new
orleans
had
it
not
been
for
two
things
the
confederate
conscription
act
and
the
determination
on
the
part
of
the
home
guards
to
evade
it
the
passage
of
that
act
was
like
a
destructive
from
a
clear
sky
and
there
were
those
in
mooreville
who
refused
to
believe
that
their
chosen
rulers
would
be
guilty
of
such
perfidy
but
the
news
had
hardly
been
received
before
the
enrolling
officer
put
in
his
appearance
thus
proving
the
truth
of
what
we
have
already
the
richmond
government
developed
into
a
despotism
so
suddenly
that
it
was
plain
the
machinery
for
it
had
been
prepared
long
before
the
enrolling
officer
captain
roach
was
a
dapper
little
fellow
who
did
not
look
as
though
he
had
seen
much
service
and
indeed
he
seen
a
day
of
it
for
when
he
received
his
commission
and
orders
from
the
governor
he
was
a
practising
lawyer
in
a
small
inland
town
beyond
the
very
slight
knowledge
which
he
had
been
able
to
gain
from
his
printed
instructions
he
knew
nothing
of
his
duties
or
of
soldiering
but
his
taught
him
that
as
tom
randolph
commission
was
older
than
his
own
military
etiquette
required
that
he
should
call
upon
tom
without
any
unnecessary
to
report
to
him
for
tom
was
not
in
the
confederate
service
or
in
any
way
connected
with
the
conscription
business
but
merely
to
show
him
proper
respect
he
reached
mooreville
in
the
morning
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
in
opening
an
office
and
spreading
abroad
the
news
of
his
arrival
so
that
those
whose
duty
it
was
to
be
conscripted
would
have
no
trouble
in
finding
him
and
the
next
morning
mounted
his
horse
and
set
out
to
find
captain
randolph
the
first
man
he
met
on
the
road
was
tom
first
lieutenant
captain
roach
did
not
know
him
but
he
saw
that
lambert
was
anxious
to
ride
on
without
speaking
and
perhaps
that
was
the
reason
he
drew
rein
and
accosted
him
said
the
captain
pleasantly
you
know
i
have
opened
an
office
in
kimberly
store
i
suppose
say
what
made
you
ask
me
that
question
for
demanded
lambert
who
was
instantly
on
his
guard
because
i
take
you
to
be
over
eighteen
and
under
and
would
like
to
have
you
drop
around
and
see
me
was
the
reply
well
i
aint
to
do
it
and
that
settles
it
see
really
i
see
how
you
can
get
out
of
it
do
hey
well
i
do
i
aint
confedrit
i
state
rights
are
you
not
aware
that
there
are
no
state
rights
people
any
more
asked
the
captain
the
conscription
act
that
has
just
been
passed
withdraws
all
citizens
between
the
ages
of
eighteen
and
from
state
control
and
places
them
absolutely
at
the
disposal
of
the
president
during
the
war
but
i
aint
agreeing
to
no
such
do
you
know
exclaimed
lambert
who
did
not
like
to
see
the
enrolling
officer
so
quiet
and
confident
for
it
looked
as
though
he
knew
what
he
was
talking
about
that
was
just
what
lincoln
wanted
to
do
when
he
called
on
our
for
soldiers
to
whop
south
but
our
he
said
he
that
kind
of
a
feller
and
his
men
should
go
out
of
the
state
why
do
he
stick
to
his
word
and
say
the
same
to
jeff
davis
my
friend
you
do
understand
the
situation
at
began
the
captain
you
do
by
a
long
sight
interrupted
lambert
i
aint
agreeing
to
no
such
bargain
i
tell
you
them
as
wants
to
go
to
virginy
to
light
for
the
can
go
for
all
me
but
i
do
want
to
go
and
by
gum
i
wo
and
furder
i
a
home
guard
in
your
case
that
does
matter
the
government
would
be
quite
willing
to
stretch
a
point
in
favor
of
home
organizations
that
have
proved
themselves
to
be
worth
something
but
you
mooreville
fellows
have
done
the
first
thing
for
the
cause
you
have
turned
some
of
our
friends
against
us
but
where
are
the
yankees
you
have
shot
and
how
many
prisoners
have
you
taken
look
here
by
gum
exclaimed
the
lieutenant
i
have
heard
all
about
you
and
the
governor
says
in
the
letter
he
sent
with
my
commission
that
the
best
thing
i
can
do
is
to
send
you
to
a
camp
of
instruction
continued
the
captain
you
are
no
good
here
for
you
do
do
anything
my
pictur
what
the
reason
we
aint
been
doing
something
for
the
cause
right
along
shouted
lambert
his
red
face
showing
that
he
was
getting
angry
we
been
the
means
of
keeping
the
union
men
in
these
parts
from
rising
up
and
taking
the
country
for
the
yankees
and
licked
a
gunboat
in
the
river
who
told
you
we
aint
done
nothing
it
must
be
some
enemy
of
ourn
who
aint
got
the
spirit
to
jine
in
with
us
and
if
i
can
find
out
who
he
is
i
make
him
sorry
for
it
i
bet
you
but
you
ca
conscript
me
i
tell
you
i
an
officer
appointed
by
the
ah
that
does
make
a
difference
perhaps
well
i
reckon
it
does
said
lambert
with
a
satisfied
smile
do
you
happen
to
have
your
commission
with
you
or
will
you
tell
me
when
i
can
see
it
this
was
what
lambert
himself
would
have
called
a
and
his
first
thought
was
to
hunt
up
tom
randolph
and
stand
over
him
with
his
until
he
had
seen
him
write
to
the
governor
asking
for
that
long
delayed
commission
tom
had
often
promised
to
do
it
but
he
never
had
and
now
lambert
was
likely
to
see
trouble
on
account
of
his
negligence
i
am
first
leftenant
of
our
company
my
commission
is
all
right
and
that
settles
that
point
said
he
at
length
if
the
yankee
general
butler
brings
his
army
from
new
orleans
to
capture
mooreville
he
will
run
against
a
snag
for
he
will
find
me
and
my
men
here
to
stop
him
we
jined
to
guard
our
homes
that
why
they
call
us
home
guards
and
that
settles
the
other
point
you
was
speaking
of
we
aint
got
no
to
show
kase
there
aint
no
yankees
come
nigh
us
but
we
are
just
as
much
use
here
as
we
would
be
up
there
in
virginy
we
need
every
man
we
can
get
replied
captain
roach
those
who
do
not
come
of
their
own
free
will
must
expect
to
be
taken
by
force
unless
they
can
show
that
they
are
of
use
at
home
you
mooreville
home
guards
have
had
the
finest
chance
in
the
world
to
make
a
name
for
yourselves
why
did
you
drive
those
gunboats
away
from
baton
rouge
long
ago
shucks
exclaimed
lambert
why
man
alive
they
got
cannons
on
what
of
it
could
you
hide
behind
the
levee
where
you
would
be
safe
and
pick
off
every
sailor
who
showed
his
head
above
decks
could
you
keep
those
small
boats
from
coming
ashore
and
going
back
loaded
down
with
provisions
you
have
been
giving
aid
and
comfort
to
the
enemy
by
permitting
such
things
and
that
contrary
to
law
but
i
must
ride
along
for
i
am
on
my
way
to
visit
captain
randolph
i
am
not
sure
that
you
are
exempt
simply
because
you
are
an
officer
in
the
state
militia
but
will
tell
you
the
next
time
we
meet
you
need
mind
looking
it
up
for
i
aint
going
i
tell
you
but
tell
you
one
thing
and
that
aint
two
if
you
take
me
you
will
have
to
take
tom
randolph
likewise
i
raise
a
fuss
if
you
do
the
two
separated
and
the
enrolling
officer
kept
on
his
way
to
the
home
of
captain
randolph
who
had
somehow
heard
that
he
might
look
for
a
distinguished
visitor
on
this
particular
morning
and
was
thrown
into
a
state
of
great
excitement
by
the
unwelcome
news
the
presence
of
the
enrolling
officer
in
town
was
all
the
evidence
tom
needed
to
prove
that
there
was
no
immediate
danger
of
an
invasion
by
the
federals
so
he
brought
his
uniform
from
its
hiding
place
in
the
garret
and
when
he
had
arrayed
himself
in
it
and
leaned
his
sword
in
one
corner
of
the
gallery
to
show
that
he
was
prepared
to
answer
when
duty
called
he
was
ready
for
the
is
as
ready
as
he
ever
would
be
for
he
would
not
have
seen
captain
roach
at
all
if
he
could
have
thought
of
any
way
to
avoid
it
rumor
said
that
the
captain
looked
as
though
he
might
have
come
out
of
some
lady
bandbox
but
all
the
same
tom
supposed
him
to
be
a
confederate
veteran
who
had
seen
service
on
many
a
hardly
contested
field
and
who
would
overawe
him
with
his
profound
knowledge
of
military
matters
tom
wished
now
that
he
had
made
a
little
better
fight
with
that
gunboat
or
that
he
had
slipped
into
baton
rouge
some
dark
night
with
a
few
picked
men
and
pulled
down
the
flag
that
the
yankee
sailors
had
hoisted
over
the
arsenal
oh
what
honors
i
might
have
gained
for
myself
if
i
had
only
thought
of
these
things
before
he
said
to
his
mother
he
always
went
to
her
with
his
troubles
now
or
when
he
stood
in
need
of
encouragement
and
advice
his
father
having
told
him
somewhat
sharply
that
he
had
washed
his
hands
of
the
home
guards
and
never
wanted
to
hear
of
them
again
as
long
as
he
lived
but
that
is
the
way
it
is
with
me
my
wit
comes
too
slow
to
be
of
any
use
i
am
very
glad
that
you
did
not
think
of
them
before
you
reckless
boy
replied
randolph
your
record
is
better
than
i
wish
it
was
for
i
am
afraid
it
will
take
you
into
the
army
what
would
you
do
if
this
enrolling
officer
should
decide
to
take
the
company
just
as
it
stands
and
swear
you
into
the
confederate
service
cæsar
ghost
cried
captain
tom
in
great
alarm
if
my
record
as
a
loyal
soldier
leads
him
to
do
that
i
shall
be
sorry
i
ever
put
on
this
uniform
what
could
i
do
could
you
not
follow
the
same
course
that
rodney
gray
pursued
when
general
lacey
came
up
from
new
orleans
to
swear
the
mooreville
rangers
into
the
confederate
army
inquired
randolph
mother
if
you
were
a
man
you
would
be
a
general
yourself
exclaimed
tom
his
fears
vanishing
on
the
instant
if
a
first
duty
sergeant
can
back
down
a
i
reckon
a
captain
in
the
state
militia
can
do
the
same
for
a
confederate
captain
he
spoke
boldly
enough
but
when
one
of
the
house
servants
came
in
to
tell
him
that
there
was
a
strange
soldier
riding
into
the
yard
he
felt
his
courage
oozing
out
at
the
ends
of
his
fingers
and
he
would
hardly
have
dared
to
go
to
the
door
to
meet
his
visitor
if
his
mother
had
not
assured
him
that
she
would
go
also
and
that
she
would
remain
close
at
his
side
to
support
him
during
the
dreaded
interview
the
enrolling
officer
did
not
look
like
a
very
stern
soldier
she
told
herself
when
she
saw
him
get
off
his
horse
and
shake
hands
with
tom
who
had
hastened
down
the
steps
to
meet
him
but
then
he
was
backed
up
by
the
whole
tremendous
power
of
the
confederate
government
and
it
was
to
her
interest
and
tom
to
make
a
friend
of
him
if
she
could
captain
roach
was
equally
anxious
to
secure
tom
assistance
in
the
disagreeable
and
perhaps
dangerous
work
he
had
to
do
and
the
consequence
was
it
was
no
trouble
at
all
for
them
to
get
acquainted
or
to
come
to
an
understanding
with
one
another
after
they
had
spent
a
few
minutes
in
talking
over
the
situation
and
the
enrolling
officer
had
shown
his
written
instructions
as
well
as
a
copy
of
the
law
by
which
he
was
supposed
to
be
governed
the
latter
said
what
surprises
me
very
much
is
that
there
is
not
the
first
word
said
about
exemptions
whether
it
was
an
oversight
or
not
the
fact
remains
that
according
to
this
law
every
man
between
the
specified
ages
must
be
conscripted
and
that
is
perfectly
right
said
captain
tom
making
a
hurried
mental
list
of
certain
persons
in
the
neighborhood
whom
he
would
be
glad
to
see
go
first
of
all
everybody
except
our
home
guards
no
sir
said
captain
roach
in
tones
so
decided
that
tom
under
jaw
began
to
drop
down
the
law
excepts
nobody
but
wait
a
minute
after
the
regiments
and
companies
that
have
gone
to
the
front
from
this
state
are
filled
up
the
rest
of
the
conscripts
will
remain
at
home
as
a
reserve
to
be
drawn
upon
at
intervals
of
not
less
than
three
months
so
that
our
organizations
in
the
field
can
be
kept
always
full
now
why
ca
you
help
me
so
as
to
keep
your
company
of
home
guards
together
as
long
as
possible
if
we
work
it
right
perhaps
you
will
not
be
called
upon
at
all
that
the
idea
exclaimed
tom
greatly
relieved
while
his
mother
smiled
her
approval
of
the
suggestion
and
told
captain
roach
on
the
spot
that
she
expected
him
to
stay
to
dinner
and
as
long
as
he
remained
in
that
part
of
the
country
to
make
himself
as
free
in
her
house
as
he
would
in
his
own
when
she
ceased
speaking
tom
continued
i
am
like
nathan
hale
who
when
the
british
were
about
to
hang
him
as
a
spy
said
he
was
sorry
he
had
but
one
life
to
give
to
his
country
but
for
all
that
i
should
like
to
stay
here
until
i
have
seen
some
of
our
neighbors
who
have
had
so
much
to
say
against
the
south
sent
to
the
front
but
how
shall
i
work
it
to
keep
my
company
together
by
doing
as
you
have
suggested
replied
the
captain
by
first
sending
away
those
who
ought
to
be
made
to
fight
for
the
south
since
they
have
had
so
much
to
say
against
her
and
her
cause
perhaps
by
the
time
they
have
been
killed
off
our
independence
will
be
acknowledged
and
then
we
shall
not
need
any
more
soldiers
that
the
idea
said
tom
again
but
how
can
the
home
guards
help
you
by
serving
in
place
of
the
troops
that
i
am
authorized
to
call
on
for
assistance
answered
captain
roach
there
will
be
a
camp
of
instruction
established
somewhere
in
the
vicinity
very
shortly
and
it
will
be
my
duty
to
forward
my
conscripts
to
that
camp
as
fast
as
i
can
get
them
together
of
course
they
will
not
go
i
understand
interrupted
captain
tom
you
want
me
to
send
some
of
my
men
with
them
as
guards
exactly
it
will
be
a
feather
in
your
cap
as
well
as
in
mine
if
we
can
attend
to
the
business
without
calling
upon
the
government
for
aid
i
do
want
to
do
that
if
i
can
avoid
it
for
every
man
we
can
raise
is
needed
at
the
front
to
resist
mcclellan
advance
upon
richmond
we
must
be
alive
for
there
going
to
be
hot
work
up
there
i
am
with
you
and
i
do
know
of
anything
that
would
suit
the
home
guards
better
replied
tom
glad
of
the
opportunity
to
gain
a
little
cheap
notoriety
without
putting
himself
in
danger
and
when
captain
roach
rode
away
from
the
house
after
dinner
tom
accompanied
him
to
his
office
in
kimberly
store
and
assisted
in
obtaining
some
from
which
he
could
make
out
a
list
of
the
unhappy
men
who
were
subject
to
military
duty
under
the
terms
of
the
conscription
act
of
course
there
were
a
goodly
number
of
young
fellows
in
the
settlement
between
the
ages
of
eighteen
and
whose
names
did
not
appear
on
the
for
they
were
not
voters
but
tom
had
them
in
his
mind
and
with
his
mother
aid
and
lambert
he
succeeded
during
the
following
week
in
making
out
a
complete
list
of
them
at
the
head
of
the
list
stood
the
name
of
edward
griffin
drummond
assistant
operator
who
had
warned
rodney
gray
that
he
was
to
be
arrested
the
moment
he
left
the
boat
at
louis
but
drummond
name
did
not
appear
at
all
griffin
is
a
particular
friend
of
one
of
my
worst
enemies
explained
tom
not
only
is
he
strong
for
the
union
but
he
has
had
a
good
deal
to
say
about
me
and
my
company
behind
our
backs
and
i
want
you
to
serve
a
notice
on
him
the
first
thing
you
do
i
wish
they
would
make
haste
and
establish
that
camp
of
instruction
and
when
griffin
is
sent
there
i
want
to
command
the
squad
that
goes
with
him
i
wish
too
that
rodney
gray
was
here
to
go
with
him
in
the
meantime
events
proved
that
the
people
of
the
south
were
not
as
willing
to
submit
to
the
despotic
acts
of
their
government
as
they
ought
to
have
been
especially
in
georgia
and
arkansas
where
it
seemed
that
a
conflict
might
arise
between
state
and
confederate
authorities
officers
of
the
militia
in
the
former
state
were
arrested
by
the
enrolling
officers
but
the
governor
demanded
their
release
and
threatened
to
arrest
the
confederates
if
they
did
not
let
his
state
officers
alone
the
richmond
government
yielded
the
point
but
said
to
the
governor
of
georgia
through
the
secretary
of
war
if
you
arrest
any
of
our
enrolling
officers
in
their
attempts
to
get
men
to
fill
up
the
georgia
regiments
now
in
the
face
of
the
enemy
you
will
cause
great
mischief
i
think
we
may
as
well
drive
out
our
common
enemy
before
we
make
war
upon
each
other
in
arkansas
governor
rector
threatened
to
secede
from
the
confederacy
and
called
for
men
to
defend
the
state
adding
that
the
troops
raised
under
this
call
are
intended
exclusively
for
home
protection
and
will
not
under
any
circumstances
be
transferred
to
the
confederate
service
without
their
consent
in
short
the
confederacy
was
in
a
very
bad
way
and
their
authorities
knew
it
for
on
the
of
april
the
congress
adjourned
in
such
haste
as
to
show
that
the
members
were
anxious
to
provide
for
their
own
personal
safety
that
was
the
time
when
a
rebel
newspaper
invented
the
word
skedaddle
and
that
was
the
time
too
when
mcclellan
could
have
taken
richmond
but
he
wasted
three
full
months
every
day
of
which
was
of
vital
moment
to
the
confederacy
in
doing
nothing
and
when
at
last
he
was
ready
to
advance
he
found
himself
confronted
by
an
army
that
was
larger
than
his
own
the
murmurs
of
dissatisfaction
that
arose
all
over
the
south
when
that
sweeping
conscription
act
was
passed
were
not
entirely
lost
upon
the
richmond
government
and
the
next
news
that
came
to
mooreville
was
that
another
act
had
been
passed
providing
for
exemptions
rodney
father
was
one
of
the
first
to
hear
of
it
and
the
next
time
he
went
to
mooreville
he
stopped
at
the
telegraph
office
and
called
ned
griffin
to
the
door
the
young
fellow
had
been
very
much
distressed
ever
since
he
received
notice
from
captain
roach
to
hold
himself
in
readiness
to
march
to
the
camp
of
instruction
with
the
first
squad
of
conscripts
that
left
town
and
tom
randolph
had
been
mean
enough
to
let
him
know
how
his
name
happened
to
be
first
on
the
list
griffin
was
the
only
support
of
a
widowed
mother
and
he
knew
that
things
would
go
hard
with
her
when
the
small
sum
he
received
for
his
work
in
the
telegraph
office
ceased
to
come
into
her
hands
every
month
more
than
that
he
believed
in
the
union
and
the
flag
that
waved
over
it
and
did
not
want
to
fight
against
his
principles
when
he
came
to
the
door
in
answer
to
gray
hail
he
looked
as
though
he
had
lost
the
last
friend
he
had
in
the
world
i
came
here
to
cheer
you
up
a
bit
by
telling
you
that
you
need
not
go
into
the
army
if
you
do
want
to
was
the
way
in
which
father
announced
the
object
of
his
visit
the
new
law
provides
for
the
exemption
of
one
agriculturist
on
each
farm
where
there
is
no
white
male
adult
not
liable
to
military
duty
employing
fifteen
negroes
on
condition
that
the
party
exempted
shall
give
bond
to
deliver
to
the
government
in
the
next
twelve
months
pounds
of
bacon
or
its
equivalent
in
salt
pork
and
pounds
of
beef
for
each
slave
employed
on
said
farm
young
griffin
gasped
for
breath
but
did
not
say
a
word
in
reply
he
did
not
smile
either
as
gray
did
for
he
failed
to
see
how
that
new
law
could
affect
him
now
i
happen
to
have
such
a
farm
up
the
river
road
continued
the
planter
there
no
one
on
it
but
a
driver
to
look
out
for
things
and
if
you
have
a
mind
to
go
up
and
take
charge
of
it
i
shall
be
glad
to
have
you
and
i
think
i
can
put
you
in
the
way
of
earning
more
money
than
you
do
now
but
gray
i
am
not
an
overseer
stammered
griffin
who
wished
from
the
bottom
of
his
heart
that
he
had
chosen
that
humble
but
useful
vocation
instead
of
telegraphy
i
do
know
the
first
thing
about
farming
well
you
ca
learn
younger
can
you
no
sir
but
fact
of
the
matter
is
where
are
the
bacon
and
beef
to
come
from
if
they
were
selling
at
a
dollar
a
ton
i
could
buy
a
hundred
pounds
you
have
a
whole
year
in
which
to
pay
it
replied
gray
but
i
do
believe
in
going
in
debt
and
perhaps
we
can
scare
up
cattle
and
hogs
enough
on
the
farm
to
fill
the
bill
and
i
shall
depend
on
you
to
raise
others
to
replace
them
i
think
you
had
better
go
you
can
take
your
mother
along
to
keep
house
for
you
and
i
do
see
why
you
live
as
well
there
on
the
farm
as
you
do
here
in
town
tell
drummond
to
come
out
here
a
moment
gray
said
griffin
with
tears
of
gratitude
in
his
eyes
i
wish
you
would
ride
around
to
our
house
and
let
mother
thank
you
for
your
kindness
i
do
know
how
i
will
save
her
and
you
the
trouble
said
the
planter
bending
down
from
his
saddle
and
speaking
in
tones
so
low
that
none
of
the
could
hear
his
words
who
was
it
that
kept
rodney
from
falling
into
the
clutches
of
that
yankee
cotton
factor
in
louis
tell
drummond
to
come
here
drummond
came
and
griffin
afterward
said
that
he
never
saw
so
mad
a
man
as
his
chief
was
when
the
planter
explained
matters
to
him
in
a
few
brief
but
emphatic
words
the
operator
had
nothing
against
griffin
personally
but
tom
randolph
had
and
as
tom
had
been
friendly
enough
to
keep
his
name
off
the
enrolling
list
drummond
felt
in
duty
bound
to
make
common
cause
with
him
gray
i
am
afraid
it
wo
work
said
he
griffin
was
conscripted
before
that
exemption
law
was
passed
i
am
prepared
to
take
the
risk
was
the
quiet
rejoinder
in
case
objections
are
made
we
shall
insist
on
having
the
first
conscripts
selected
from
the
instead
of
from
a
private
list
and
if
any
objections
are
made
to
that
we
will
report
the
matter
at
headquarters
your
name
comes
pretty
close
to
the
top
of
the
list
mr
drummond
the
operator
was
frightened
and
saw
plainly
that
it
would
not
be
a
safe
piece
of
business
to
make
an
enemy
of
gray
he
knew
too
much
besides
he
was
one
of
the
richest
planters
in
the
state
and
such
men
always
exerted
a
good
deal
of
influence
when
they
set
about
it
of
course
sir
i
hope
it
will
work
drummond
hastened
to
say
for
i
do
want
to
see
anybody
forced
into
the
army
i
only
said
i
was
afraid
it
would
i
understand
ned
you
might
as
well
start
now
as
any
time
go
and
say
to
your
mother
and
hurry
up
to
my
house
i
will
be
there
in
a
couple
of
hours
and
after
we
have
had
a
snack
we
ride
up
to
the
farm
from
the
telegraph
office
gray
went
to
kimberly
store
where
he
created
another
commotion
tom
randolph
was
there
and
so
were
some
of
the
home
guards
who
had
of
late
taken
to
spending
all
their
waking
hours
at
the
enrolling
office
captain
tom
would
have
protested
loudly
if
his
amazement
and
chagrin
had
permitted
him
to
speak
at
all
but
captain
roach
had
no
objections
to
offer
when
gray
told
him
that
he
would
have
to
find
someone
to
take
griffin
place
in
the
first
squad
of
conscripts
that
was
sent
to
the
camp
of
instruction
for
griffin
himself
was
exempt
under
the
law
or
would
be
as
soon
as
he
had
taken
his
new
position
i
am
surprised
at
you
exclaimed
tom
when
gray
had
mounted
his
horse
and
galloped
away
you
must
let
that
man
griffin
off
you
ca
have
i
told
you
that
he
is
union
i
have
my
own
interests
to
look
out
for
replied
captain
roach
rather
sharply
and
consequently
i
can
not
afford
to
get
into
trouble
with
such
a
man
as
gray
he
did
say
much
nor
did
he
bluster
at
all
but
i
knew
by
the
glint
in
his
eye
that
there
was
a
whole
battery
of
big
guns
behind
the
little
he
did
say
and
that
he
was
ready
to
turn
them
loose
on
me
if
i
said
an
ugly
word
to
him
we
have
been
playing
square
since
this
thing
began
and
he
knows
it
and
if
he
should
insist
on
having
a
new
deal
from
the
with
your
list
of
names
thrown
out
where
would
your
friend
drummond
be
where
would
you
be
seeing
that
even
home
guards
are
not
exempt
i
just
do
care
and
that
all
there
is
about
it
whined
tom
who
was
mad
enough
to
cry
if
he
had
been
alone
they
ought
to
be
exempt
and
i
do
see
why
those
richmond
fellows
left
them
out
that
neither
here
nor
there
they
left
them
out
but
in
working
to
keep
you
with
me
i
have
practically
exempted
you
and
that
is
something
i
had
no
business
to
do
i
ca
imagine
where
gray
got
his
information
but
he
understands
all
this
and
if
he
should
report
me
to
the
governor
i
have
to
join
some
regiment
in
the
field
and
that
a
place
i
want
to
keep
away
from
as
bad
as
you
do
well
i
must
say
that
things
have
come
to
a
pretty
pass
when
a
man
can
say
who
shall
go
into
the
army
and
who
shall
not
just
because
he
happens
to
have
a
little
money
declared
tom
spitefully
that
the
way
the
thing
stands
and
if
you
want
to
stay
at
home
you
and
your
men
had
better
be
doing
something
these
chance
words
which
really
did
not
mean
anything
set
some
of
the
home
guards
to
thinking
chapter
iv
lieutenant
lambert
campaign
of
course
the
principal
topic
of
conversation
at
the
enrolling
office
during
the
rest
of
the
day
was
gray
unexpected
interference
in
behalf
of
ned
griffin
the
conscript
it
frightened
captain
roach
enraged
and
disgusted
tom
randolph
and
put
lieutenant
lambert
into
a
very
anxious
frame
of
mind
the
latter
was
obliged
to
confess
that
his
chances
for
keeping
out
of
the
army
were
very
slim
indeed
that
the
way
the
thing
stands
and
if
you
want
to
stay
at
home
you
and
your
men
had
better
be
doing
something
he
kept
saying
to
himself
as
he
galloped
along
the
dusty
road
on
his
way
home
it
was
easy
enough
for
captain
roach
to
talk
but
what
was
there
that
the
home
guards
could
do
to
distinguish
themselves
seeing
that
the
federal
troops
were
so
secure
in
their
position
at
new
orleans
that
the
whole
confederate
army
could
not
drive
them
out
and
that
the
gunboats
in
the
river
in
front
of
baton
rouge
could
not
be
whipped
by
men
who
were
armed
only
with
squirrel
rifles
and
shot
guns
lambert
had
been
turning
the
matter
over
in
his
mind
ever
since
gray
left
the
enrolling
office
in
the
morning
and
now
he
did
something
which
he
had
declared
he
never
would
do
as
long
as
he
lived
he
went
out
of
his
way
to
ask
the
advice
of
a
confederate
veteran
who
had
just
returned
from
the
army
of
the
centre
disabled
by
wounds
received
in
battle
there
were
several
of
these
crippled
veterans
in
the
neighborhood
and
they
had
been
so
many
thorns
in
tom
randolph
side
ever
since
they
first
began
straggling
home
from
the
front
to
begin
with
they
turned
up
their
noses
at
the
home
guards
and
made
all
manner
of
sport
of
their
finely
uniformed
captain
when
they
saw
him
riding
along
the
road
slyly
pricking
his
horse
with
his
spurs
to
make
the
animal
prance
and
go
sideways
as
an
officer
horse
ought
to
do
they
laughed
too
when
they
heard
the
home
guards
tell
of
their
fight
with
that
gunboat
and
some
of
them
went
so
far
as
to
declare
that
disabled
as
they
were
and
half
dead
with
camp
fever
besides
they
could
arm
themselves
with
and
drive
tom
randolph
and
his
warriors
into
the
mississippi
river
in
the
next
place
almost
all
these
veterans
had
brought
home
with
them
a
goodly
supply
of
yankee
relics
and
trophies
in
the
shape
of
uniform
coats
pants
caps
and
overcoats
that
had
been
picked
up
on
the
field
and
which
for
some
reason
or
other
they
seemed
anxious
to
get
off
their
hands
so
they
offered
them
to
the
home
guards
in
exchange
for
citizens
clothing
of
equal
or
less
value
and
the
latter
were
always
found
willing
to
trade
captain
tom
was
disgusted
and
angry
when
first
one
man
and
then
another
appeared
at
the
enrolling
office
clad
in
some
portion
of
a
shabby
uniform
that
had
once
belonged
to
a
federal
trooper
or
and
ordered
the
wearers
to
clear
out
and
never
come
there
again
unless
they
could
come
properly
dressed
but
the
home
guards
paid
no
sort
of
attention
to
him
they
were
soldiers
they
said
and
since
their
own
government
did
not
think
enough
of
them
to
provide
them
with
uniforms
they
felt
at
liberty
to
obtain
them
where
they
could
besides
their
new
clothes
even
though
they
were
well
worn
and
had
once
belonged
to
lincoln
hirelings
were
warm
and
comfortable
and
the
blue
overcoats
would
keep
out
next
winter
cold
as
effectually
as
gray
ones
much
against
his
will
tom
finally
appealed
to
the
enrolling
officer
but
the
latter
could
not
help
him
for
he
had
no
authority
over
the
home
guards
but
you
might
threaten
to
conscript
them
if
they
do
obey
my
orders
suggested
tom
i
should
like
to
do
it
for
a
little
thing
like
that
replied
captain
roach
they
got
the
uniforms
and
i
do
see
how
you
are
going
to
keep
them
from
wearing
them
what
difference
does
it
make
anyway
you
do
have
to
go
on
dress
parade
no
matter
for
that
replied
tom
i
did
enter
the
service
to
command
a
lot
of
yankees
and
i
wo
do
it
suppose
a
general
officer
should
happen
along
and
order
them
out
for
drill
and
inspection
feel
so
ashamed
of
myself
that
i
know
i
should
take
to
my
heels
make
your
mind
easy
on
that
score
was
the
captain
answer
if
you
do
take
to
your
heels
until
that
happens
you
will
never
run
judging
from
what
i
have
learned
since
i
have
been
here
the
government
cares
no
more
for
companies
of
this
kind
than
it
does
for
so
many
wild
hogs
in
the
woods
if
it
were
not
for
you
and
your
mother
i
would
conscript
the
last
one
of
them
but
what
do
you
suppose
makes
the
returned
veterans
so
anxious
to
get
rid
of
these
yankee
uniforms
and
things
continued
tom
it
looks
to
me
as
though
there
might
be
something
back
of
it
that
the
way
it
looks
to
me
too
replied
captain
roach
they
do
want
to
have
a
yankee
scouting
party
ride
up
on
them
suddenly
and
say
here
johnny
have
you
been
robbing
some
wounded
or
captive
yank
if
not
where
did
you
get
those
blue
clothes
but
the
yankees
are
not
here
cried
tom
i
know
they
are
not
here
now
but
they
coming
and
if
they
keep
on
besting
us
at
every
point
as
they
are
doing
at
this
minute
they
will
be
here
before
long
too
you
need
think
that
farragut
is
going
to
remain
idle
down
the
river
or
that
davis
is
going
to
keep
on
doing
nothing
up
the
river
while
we
are
fortifying
vicksburg
there
going
to
be
fun
here
one
of
these
days
and
sure
enough
there
was
it
came
much
sooner
than
captain
roach
had
any
reason
to
think
it
would
and
lieutenant
lambert
of
the
home
guards
whom
we
saw
on
his
way
to
ask
advice
of
a
confederate
veteran
was
the
man
who
did
the
most
to
help
it
along
he
found
the
soldier
of
whom
he
was
in
search
at
his
home
he
was
sitting
on
the
gallery
enjoying
his
after
supper
smoke
but
when
he
saw
the
home
guard
alight
at
his
gate
he
staggered
to
his
feet
laid
hold
of
the
crutch
that
leaned
against
the
house
behind
his
chair
and
said
in
mock
alarm
the
man
you
want
to
see
do
live
here
no
more
he
done
moved
outen
the
country
two
year
ago

lambert
or
by
gum
i

there
and

if
you
aint
got
but
one
leg
to
defend
yourself
with
he
hitched
his
horse
at
the
fence
shook
hands
with
the
veteran
then
seated
himself
on
the
porch
close
by
his
chair
and
continued
me
and
you
have
always
been
the
best
kind
of
friends
abner
and
i
do
want
you
to
sniff
at
me

by
the
yankees
and
i

i
wo
never
do
the
like
no
more
but
a
home
guard
and
lickin
a
gunboat
that
got
inches
of
iron
on
her
sides
and
four
foot
of
solid
oak
back
of
that
with
nothing
in
the
wide
world
but
popguns
said
the
veteran
taking
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
to
indulge
in
a
hearty
peal
of
laughter
tom
randolph
fur
a
that
there
is
a
leetle
the
worst
i
ever
heard
of
steady
on
the
left
centre
he
yelled
dropping
his
crutch
upon
the
gallery
and
grasping
with
both
hands
the
stump
of
his
leg
which
he
had
wrenched
a
little
too
severely
during
his
paroxysms
of
merriment
i
almost
disremembered
that
i
aint
got
only
part
of
a
leg
on
this
side
i
left
the
rest
up
to
shiloh
i
glad
to
see
you
again
sile
i
am
so
but
i
would
be
a
heap
gladder
if
me
and
you
had
chawed
and
fit
the
yanks
together
then
you
would
be
no
such
triflin
thing
as
a
home
guard
but
i
do
want
to
fight
no
yanks
said
lambert
truthfully
do
you
want
to
fight
no
yanks
well
i
do
know
i
blamin
you
fur
that
they
aint
by
no
means
the
easy
fellers
to
lick
that
we
uns
thought
they
was
goin
to
be
and
when
they
set
up
that
yell
of
theirn
to
let
we
uns
know
they
was
comin
fur
tell
you
sile
my
hair
always
riz
when
i
heard
that
yell
and
i
wisht
i
was
to
home
fur
taters
then
what
makes
you
poke
fun
at
me
fur
demanded
lambert
i
am
to
home
now
and
i
want
to
stay
but
roach
he
allows
that
if
we
uns
do
do
something
pretty
sudden
we
liable
to
be
conscripted
like
enough
then
why
do
you
uns
do
something
that
what
i
come
here
to
see
you
about
what
is
they
i
like
to
know
that
we
can
do
if
the
yanks
would
only
come
where
we
be
you
will
notice
that
lambert
did
not
say
yankees
any
more
he
copied
the
veteran
and
used
the
shorter
word
we
uns
could
show
the
folks
about
here
that
we
home
guards
aint
by
no
means
the
useless
truck
they
take
us
to
be
but
we
ca
go
all
the
way
to
new
orleans
fur
the
sake
of
fightin
you
uns
will
see
yanks
enough
if
you
stay
right
where
you
be
said
the
veteran
with
another
laugh
i
aint
spilin
fur
a
sight
at
any
more
of
but
all
the
same
i
look
to
see
them
ridin
right
along
this
road
while
i
am
settin
on
my
gallery
watchin
of
they
aint
come
this
clost
to
mooreville
to
go
away
without
seein
it
hoppin
us
right
along
and
we
had
oughter
be
whopped
now
just
listen
at
you
said
lambert
reproachfully
i
only
tellin
you
what
i
know
said
the
veteran
in
earnest
tones
look
at
the
way
they
doin
when
the
law
was
passed
that
everybody
must
be
conscripted
why
did
they
go
to
work
and
conscript
everybody
why
did
they
put
the
old
soldiers
ahead
and
shove
the
johnny
raws
into
the
ranks
steader
that
they
let
the
old
soldiers
stay
in
the
ranks
and
put
over
them
fur
officers
a
lot
of
new
chaps
who
could
a
yank
from
a
if
they
had
seed
the
two
standin
in
one
place
we
uns
aint
a
goin
to
whop
nobody
with
a
lot
of
greenhorns
to
command
us
and
although
i
aint
by
no
means
glad
to
go
hobblin
through
the
world
on
one
leg
i
am
mighty
glad
of
an
excuse
to
get
outen
the
army
now
there
that
there
rodney
gray
by
gum
i
wish
he
was
here
to
be
conscripted
exclaimed
lambert
the
veteran
took
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
blew
a
cloud
of
smoke
into
the
air
and
looked
at
his
companion
with
an
expression
on
his
face
which
seemed
to
say
that
he
did
not
know
whether
to
laugh
or
get
angry
but
finally
he
concluded
to
laugh
and
he
did
so
most
uproariously
rolling
about
on
his
chair
as
if
he
were
in
danger
of
falling
out
of
it
but
all
the
while
taking
good
care
not
to
give
his
wounded
leg
another
wrench
why
man
he
a
soldier
rodney
is
he
said
as
soon
as
he
could
speak
and
a
mighty
good
one
too
he
been
in
more
battles
than
me
and
that
useless
he
fit
all
through
missoury
with
daddy
price
and
then
they
brung
him
over
to
the
army
of
the
centre
and
that
where
i
seen
him
they
wanted
to
make
a
big
officer
of
him
but
rodney
he
would
have
it
so
kase
he
plum
sick
of
the
war
same
as
i
be
and
allows
to
come
home
soon
his
extry
three
months
is
out
you
tech
rodney
gray
i
know
that
well
enough
but
i
wish
we
could
you
see
tom
you
need
say
no
more
laughed
the
veteran
rodney
got
an
office
in
hubbard
rangers
and
tom
did
and
tom
is
mad
about
it
and
wants
to
spite
rodney
in
some
way
but
he
ca
do
it
and
if
he
tries
it
ole
man
gray
will
make
him
wish
he
had
and
ole
man
gray
is
another
chap
i
like
mighty
well
to
see
sent
to
the
front
exclaimed
lambert
angrily
but
we
ca
touch
him
neither
he
showed
his
hand
when
he
come
into
the
office
this
morning
and
told
roach
that
he
have
to
let
that
griffin
boy
go
free
kase
he
allowed
to
buy
him
off
with
bacon
and
beef
and
roach
was
that
skeared
that
he
dassent
open
his
mouth
what
was
he
skeared
of
that
ole
man
gray
would
report
him
fur
leavin
the
names
of
tom
randolph
friends
the
conscript
list
when
he
had
oughter
put
them
on
like
he
found
them
in
the
like
enough
replied
abner
and
then
you
and
tom
randolph
and
all
the
rest
of
the
home
guards
would
have
stood
as
fine
a
chance
of
to
the
front
as
ned
griffin
it
would
serve
you
just
right
fur
under
such
a
no
account
as
you
have
got
why
do
you
cut
loose
from
him
and
do
something
on
your
own
hook
that
would
be
me
if
i
was
you
safe
replied
lambert
who
had
not
yet
forgotten
that
he
brought
himself
into
trouble
the
last
time
he
tried
to
do
something
on
his
own
hook
somehow
our
folks
have
got
to
be
mighty
tender
of
the
union
men
about
here
and
do
like
to
have
them
pestered
you
let
your
union
neighbors
alone
and
pester
them
that
got
into
their
hands
said
the
veteran
indignantly
you
uns
aint
got
no
call
to
fight
them
that
ca
fight
back
but
there
them
gunboats
down
to
the
river
well
what
of
demanded
lambert
trembling
at
the
bare
thought
of
again
venturing
within
gunshot
of
one
of
those
black
monsters
got
cannons
on
and
they
shoot
balls
your
head
do
i
know
aint
i
been
in
a
fight
with
one
of
shucks
sneered
abner
you
stand
about
as
much
chance
of
bein
hit
by
one
of
them
big
balls
as
you
do
of
bein
struck
by
lightnin
i
have
seed
me
on
the
skirmish
line
lyin
fur
hours
behind
a
stump
that
no
a
plug
hat
while
shell
and
solid
shot
was
tearin
up
the
ground
all
around
me
they
do
do
damage
once
a
week
drapped
into
a
line
of
battle
or
into
a
fort
that
is
packed
full
of
men
but
how
can
we
lick
inches
of
iron
and
four
foot
of
solid
oak
protested
lambert
shucks
exclaimed
the
veteran
i
aint
talkin
about
lickin
on
i
talkin
about
pesterin
of
their
back
when
they
start
to
come
to
the
shore
and
pickin
off
the
officers
as
fast
as
they
come
outen
their
holes
in
the
cabin
you
uns
could
lay
behind
the
levee
and
do
that
and
be
as
safe
as
you
be
to
home
kase
the
shells
they
would
send
at
you
would
all
fly
over
your
heads
and
when
they
they
would
be
a
mile
to
your
rear
the
lieutenant
of
the
home
guards
was
overjoyed
to
hear
these
encouraging
words
fall
from
the
lips
of
a
man
who
had
faced
the
yankees
in
battle
and
knew
what
he
was
talking
about
he
had
given
his
friend
abner
to
understand
that
he
was
one
of
the
few
who
followed
captain
tom
when
the
latter
rode
out
with
a
handful
of
brave
men
to
see
if
the
union
army
was
advancing
upon
mooreville
from
baton
rouge
but
there
was
not
a
word
of
truth
in
his
story
he
was
one
of
the
majority
who
excused
themselves
and
stayed
behind
and
all
he
knew
about
that
desperate
fight
with
the
gunboat
and
the
concealed
battery
that
opened
on
the
rear
of
the
home
guards
was
what
his
comrades
told
him
the
veteran
did
not
seem
to
think
that
the
big
guns
on
the
war
vessels
were
so
very
dangerous
and
lambert
began
to
pluck
up
courage
to
me
that
roach
said
something
like
that
the
first
time
i
talked
with
him
said
the
latter
like
enough
and
if
he
did
you
can
bet
that
that
is
what
he
would
do
if
he
had
as
many
home
guards
under
his
command
as
you
have
got
i
ca
fur
the
life
of
me
see
what
makes
them
baton
rouge
folks
so
very
friendly
with
the
yanks
anyhow
they
take
into
their
houses
and
visit
with
and
feed
it
all
and
i
say
such
doings
aint
right
if
ole
daddy
bragg
was
here
fur
about
five
minutes
he
put
a
stop
to
all
that
friendship
business
i
bet
you
and
like
as
not
he
have
some
of
you
home
guards
shot
fur
lettin
it
go
on
as
long
as
it
has
anyway
he
kick
tom
randolph
into
the
ranks
and
put
a
soldier
in
his
place
that
the
way
they
do
things
up
in
the
army
of
the
centre
the
result
of
this
interview
was
that
when
lieutenant
lambert
took
leave
of
the
veteran
and
rode
home
to
a
late
supper
he
was
fully
satisfied
in
his
own
mind
that
tom
randolph
was
totally
unfit
for
the
responsible
position
he
held
that
the
home
guards
who
under
proper
leadership
might
have
made
themselves
known
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
confederacy
had
been
kept
in
check
too
long
already
and
that
he
lambert
being
second
in
command
of
the
company
had
a
perfect
right
to
take
matters
into
his
own
hands
without
saying
a
word
to
anybody
about
it
but
it
was
a
somewhat
delicate
task
he
told
himself
although
lambert
looked
upon
the
friendly
relations
existing
between
the
crews
of
the
union
war
vessels
and
the
baton
rouge
people
as
a
burning
disgrace
he
did
not
relish
the
idea
of
trying
to
bring
them
to
an
end
for
the
citizens
might
not
like
it
and
worse
than
that
they
might
make
him
trouble
on
account
of
it
but
something
must
be
done
or
he
would
be
compelled
to
go
into
the
army
seeing
that
he
had
no
rich
and
influential
friend
like
gray
to
purchase
his
release
with
bacon
and
beef
so
lambert
mind
was
made
up
and
before
he
reached
home
his
campaign
was
fully
planned
i
raise
a
big
squad
and
start
for
the
city
night
he
soliloquized
flourishing
his
in
the
air
to
give
emphasis
to
his
thoughts
and
if
i
once
gain
a
footing
behind
the
levee
put
a
stop
to
that
friendship
business
i
bet
you
i
give
the
folks
to
understand
that
we
uns
do
like
the
way
they
giving
aid
and
comfort
to
the
enemies
of
their
country
and
make
them
yankee
stay
on
board
their
ships
where
they
belong
i
take
pains
too
to
see
that
the
hears
of
it
and
perhaps
say
that
i
had
ought
to
be
of
the
home
guards
in
place
of
tom
randolph
that
was
an
encouraging
thought
and
the
longer
lambert
dwelt
upon
it
the
more
excited
he
became
he
did
not
sleep
much
that
night
and
after
an
early
breakfast
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
through
the
country
to
muster
his
men
but
as
fast
as
he
found
them
and
unfolded
to
them
the
details
of
his
campaign
he
was
met
by
the
same
excuses
and
refusals
that
tom
randolph
had
vainly
tried
to
combat
the
fighting
member
of
the
company
the
one
who
was
always
eager
to
shoot
or
hang
the
defenceless
union
men
he
assisted
in
robbing
was
feeling
so
very
poorly
on
this
particular
morning
that
he
was
thinking
strongly
of
riding
over
to
a
neighbor
to
see
if
he
could
not
borrow
a
dose
or
two
of
quinine
the
second
had
promised
to
go
to
a
log
rolling
the
third
had
a
lame
horse
and
did
rightly
know
where
he
could
go
to
get
another
and
not
more
than
three
or
four
out
of
the
fifty
men
whom
lambert
summoned
to
follow
him
to
baton
rouge
had
the
courage
and
honesty
to
tell
him
that
they
did
not
like
to
do
it
i
would
mind
hiding
behind
the
levee
and
shooting
a
few
yankees
said
lieutenant
moseley
but
they
shoot
back
and
like
as
not
that
make
the
baton
rouge
folks
mad
at
us
ask
somebody
else
you
can
get
all
the
men
you
want
and
i
do
reckon
i
go
whenever
a
home
guard
talked
to
him
in
this
way
lambert
always
said
in
reply
well
then
if
you
do
want
to
go
and
win
a
name
fur
yourself
you
can
stay
to
home
till
roach
gets
ready
to
conscript
you
if
you
were
in
kimberly
store
yesterday
you
must
have
seen
fur
a
fact
that
we
uns
aint
safe
from
going
into
the
army
just
kase
we
happen
to
belong
to
the
home
guards
roach
he
has
said
time
and
again
that
we
was
liable
to
go
if
we
did
wake
up
and
do
something
and
that
if
he
had
been
our
commander
he
would
have
let
them
city
people
get
on
such
amazing
good
terms
with
the
yanks
le
go
down
there
and
make
quit
it
right
now
and
say
nothing
to
nobody
till
the
thing
is
done
remember
i
do
ask
every
man
but
only
just
them
that
we
want
to
have
stay
in
the
company
when
we
get
back
i
give
roach
a
list
of
them
that
went
with
me
and
if
he
wants
to
conscript
the
that
was
afraid
to
face
the
enemies
of
their
send
them
to
the
camp
of
instruction
he
can
do
it
and
welcome
now
what
do
you
say
it
was
by
the
use
of
such
arguments
as
these
that
lieutenant
lambert
succeeded
in
inducing
some
of
his
particular
friends
to
believe
that
it
might
be
policy
for
them
to
join
his
expedition
and
that
night
they
secretly
gathered
at
a
designated
place
outside
the
town
and
started
for
baton
rouge
when
they
arrived
within
sight
of
the
church
spires
at
daylight
they
did
not
attract
attention
to
themselves
by
entering
the
city
in
a
body
for
lambert
was
afraid
that
some
union
man
or
converted
rebel
might
suspect
the
object
of
their
visit
and
interfere
with
their
designs
by
signalling
to
the
fleet
they
separated
and
went
in
by
different
roads
and
in
small
parties
and
came
together
again
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
landing
at
which
the
boats
from
the
fleet
always
touched
the
shore
taking
care
to
leave
their
horses
behind
some
warehouses
out
of
sight
now
be
careful
everybody
commanded
lambert
placing
a
fresh
cap
on
his
rifle
and
waving
his
hand
toward
the
levee
as
a
signal
to
his
men
to
advance
and
conceal
themselves
behind
it
we
ca
do
no
damage
from
too
fur
so
we
must
wait
till
some
of
their
come
off
the
home
guards
bent
themselves
almost
double
and
stole
across
the
clear
space
that
intervened
between
the
warehouses
and
the
levee
and
so
cautious
were
they
in
their
movements
that
the
quartermasters
on
watch
on
the
decks
of
the
different
gunboats
who
were
constantly
sweeping
the
banks
on
both
sides
of
the
river
with
their
spyglasses
saw
no
signs
of
them
and
so
silent
that
when
they
crept
to
the
top
of
the
levee
on
their
hands
and
knees
and
looked
over
it
the
negroes
gathered
at
the
landing
below
did
not
know
that
there
was
anyone
near
them
there
were
probably
a
dozen
men
women
and
children
in
the
group
and
they
were
lying
at
their
ease
on
the
ground
or
walking
slowly
back
and
forth
but
all
of
them
turned
their
gaze
toward
the
gunboats
now
and
then
as
if
they
were
waiting
for
somebody
to
come
ashore
there
were
several
covered
baskets
and
pails
near
by
and
the
sight
of
them
was
enough
to
enrage
lieutenant
lambert
who
whispered
to
the
man
who
lay
next
him
behind
the
levee
pass
the
word
along
the
line
fur
everybody
to
keep
under
kiver
ketched
them
niggers
in
the
very
act
fur
there
grub
in
them
buckets
and
things
now
you
just
watch
and
see
if
there
aint
then
he
raised
his
voice
a
little
and
said
to
the
nearest
darkey
what
you
folks
doing
there
who
you
looking
fur
waiting
for
wilcox
sah
was
the
negro
prompt
answer
he
looked
up
and
saw
two
or
three
heads
above
the
top
of
the
levee
but
thought
nothing
of
it
there
were
a
good
many
whites
in
baton
rouge
who
did
not
dare
show
themselves
as
freely
to
the
yankee
sailors
as
the
people
of
his
own
color
did
who
mr
wilcox
demanded
lambert
he
de
cater
ob
de
steerage
mess
sah
de
man
what
buys
de
fur
some
of
de
officers
on
dat
fust
boat
was
the
reply
and
although
lambert
did
not
understand
the
words
any
better
than
the
negro
did
himself
he
gathered
from
them
the
idea
that
somebody
on
the
gunboat
would
come
ashore
for
his
breakfast
very
shortly
and
that
he
and
his
warriors
had
reached
the
levee
just
in
the
nick
of
time
this
cheering
intelligence
was
passed
along
the
line
in
a
whisper
and
the
home
guards
pulled
off
their
hats
and
were
settling
themselves
into
comfortable
positions
behind
the
levee
to
await
the
coming
of
the
caterer
boat
when
they
were
startled
by
hearing
someone
close
beside
them
say
in
frightened
and
protesting
tones
gentlemen
what
are
you
going
to
do
lambert
faced
quickly
around
and
saw
a
couple
of
citizens
standing
at
the
base
of
the
levee
where
they
could
observe
all
that
was
being
done
by
the
home
guards
but
whether
they
had
come
upon
his
ambush
by
accident
or
design
the
lieutenant
did
not
know
or
care
to
ask
he
saw
the
necessity
for
prompt
action
scrooch
down
right
where
you
stand
so
that
the
yanks
ca
see
you
he
commanded
but
what
are
you
gentlemen
going
to
do
inquired
one
of
the
citizens
both
of
whom
obeyed
lambert
order
and
sank
upon
their
heels
with
alacrity
when
they
saw
the
black
muzzles
of
three
or
four
swinging
in
their
direction
well
if
you
ca
see
fur
yourselves
what
we
uns
are
going
to
do
i
reckon
i
have
to
tell
you
replied
the
lieutenant
of
the
home
guards
turning
part
way
around
so
that
he
could
watch
both
negroes
and
citizens
at
the
same
time
and
see
that
no
signals
passed
from
them
to
the
fleet
we
goin
to
break
up
the
visitin
and
tradin
been
going
on
between
this
town
and
the
yanks
till
we
are
teetotally
sick
and
tired
of
it
the
folks
back
in
the
country
who
are
all
good
confederits
do
like
it
and
me
and
my
men
have
come
in
here
to
say
so
in
a
way
that
both
you
and
the
yanks
will
understand
merciful
heaven
exclaimed
the
man
who
seemed
to
be
almost
overcome
with
astonishment
and
alarm
you
are
not
going
to
fire
into
those
war
vessels
what
the
reason
i
aint
said
lambert
coolly
you
just
wait
till
one
of
their
starts
to
come
ashore
and
i
show
you
but
consider
for
a
began
the
citizen
his
excitement
bringing
him
to
his
feet
down
you
go
again
interrupted
lambert
drawing
his
cocked
rifle
to
his
shoulder
we
uns
have
considered
the
whole
business
we
know
that
we
ca
hurt
inches
of
iron
and
four
foot
of
solid
oak
back
of
that
with
like
these
we
got
but
we
can
make
them
mighty
jubersome
about
comin
ashore
and
being
so
very
friendly
with
you
baton
rouge
folks
and
that
what
we
allow
to
do
in
the
name
of
god
and
humanity
i
protest
against
such
an
outrage
said
one
of
the
men
whose
pale
face
and
firmly
set
lips
showed
that
he
would
not
have
stopped
with
a
mere
protest
if
he
had
possessed
the
power
to
do
anything
else
you
must
not
think
of
it
you
madman
cried
the
other
do
you
know
that
the
boats
will
return
your
fire
and
that
they
can
knock
our
town
to
pieces
with
a
single
broadside
there
is
no
telling
how
many
innocent
women
and
children
will
be
killed
or
maimed
through
your
act
of
folly
well
then
why
did
you
think
of
all
them
things
before
you
made
friends
with
the
enemies
of
your
country
answered
lambert
but
the
gunboats
wo
fire
on
women
and
children
leastways
they
did
in
new
orleans
and
the
folks
in
that
burg
were
about
as
sassy
as
they
could
well
be
if
you
are
determined
to
carry
your
crazy
scheme
into
execution
i
beg
that
you
will
give
us
a
little
time
to
remove
our
families
to
a
place
of
safety
before
you
begin
said
one
of
the
citizens
as
he
and
his
companion
arose
to
their
feet
and
turned
to
go
away
not
much
as
anybody
knows
of
i
wo
replied
lambert
in
savage
tones
just
five
minutes
pleaded
the
citizen
perhaps
we
can
take
our
wives
and
little
ones
into
the
cellar
before
you
will
find
it
necessary
to
open
fire
not
one
one
second
nor
a
half
of
one
snarled
the
lieutenant
once
more
raising
his
weapon
to
his
shoulder
i
aint
to
have
you
shakin
a
handkercher
at
them
boats
to
warn
the
yanks
that
there
something
wrong
here
behind
the
levee
you
just
squat
down
where
you
are
till
this
thing
is
over
and
then
you
can
go
any
place
you
please
watch
out
sile
said
one
of
the
home
guards
suddenly
there
comes
that
feller
after
his
grub
lieutenant
lambert
flopped
over
on
his
face
as
if
he
had
been
shot
and
saw
a
small
boat
with
four
men
at
the
oars
and
two
officers
sitting
in
the
come
into
view
from
behind
one
of
the
war
vessels
and
turn
toward
the
landing
the
time
for
him
to
win
a
name
for
himself
had
arrived
chapter
how
it
resulted
i
would
take
ten
gold
dollars
fur
my
chance
of
being
made
of
this
company
of
home
guards
who
would
have
been
conscripted
to
the
last
man
if
it
had
been
fur
me
thought
lieutenant
lambert
as
he
rolled
over
on
his
face
and
watched
the
cutter
rounding
the
stern
of
the
nearest
war
vessel
look
wild
there
he
whispered
almost
fiercely
to
his
men
be
sure
and
hold
your
fire
till
they
come
clost
in
to
the
shore
so
that
every
shot
will
tell
i
do
want
to
hear
another
word
outen
you
two
he
went
on
addressing
himself
to
the
citizens
who
implored
him
to
stop
where
he
was
and
not
bring
destruction
upon
their
town
and
death
to
innocent
people
in
it
as
he
surely
would
do
if
he
commanded
his
home
guards
to
fire
upon
that
unarmed
boat
you
too
big
cowards
to
fight
the
enemy
yourselves
and
so
we
uns
had
to
come
in
here
and
do
it
fur
you
hold
steady
everybody
although
lambert
men
were
all
hunters
and
good
shots
they
were
not
disciplined
soldiers
and
that
was
all
that
saved
the
cutter
crew
from
annihilation
they
would
have
been
steady
enough
if
they
had
been
in
the
woods
watching
a
runway
for
deer
but
watching
for
yankees
was
a
different
matter
altogether
and
just
as
the
home
guards
had
pushed
their
guns
over
the
top
of
the
levee
making
use
of
every
clod
and
piece
of
driftwood
and
inequality
of
the
ground
that
came
handy
for
a
screen
and
lieutenant
lambert
was
cautiously
lifting
his
head
to
observe
the
progress
the
small
boat
was
making
toward
the
landing
a
deafening
roar
rang
in
his
ear
and
the
man
at
his
side
sprang
to
his
feet
stood
bewildered
for
a
moment
and
then
dropped
back
to
his
place
again
in
pushing
his
over
the
levee
with
nervous
hands
the
valorous
home
guard
had
accidentally
discharged
the
piece
and
the
unexpected
report
frightened
him
and
threw
his
comrades
into
some
confusion
for
an
instant
or
two
a
few
of
them
looked
and
acted
as
though
they
wanted
to
take
to
their
heels
but
the
voice
of
lieutenant
lambert
who
was
the
first
to
recover
himself
checked
them
shoot
fire
he
yelled
massy
knows
do
no
good
and
that
is
something
we
can
thank
you
fur
ike
spencer
a
man
that
lay
flat
on
the
ground
and
let
his
gun
shoot
itself
off
without
orders
ca
be
conscripted
any
too
quick
to
suit
me
and
i
introjuce
you
to
roach
soon
i
get
home
fire
i
tell
you
and
the
home
guards
all
together
like
trained
soldiers
but
one
after
another
just
as
it
happened
but
the
distance
was
so
great
and
their
aim
so
bad
that
not
a
man
in
the
boat
was
injured
it
stopped
instantly
however
and
came
no
nearer
the
landing
and
on
being
hailed
by
the
officer
of
the
deck
it
turned
about
and
went
back
to
the
vessel
to
which
it
belonged
then
came
the
very
thing
which
the
frightened
citizens
had
predicted
and
lieutenant
lambert
had
scouted
no
sooner
had
the
small
boat
disappeared
around
the
stern
of
the
war
ship
than
a
heavy
cloud
of
smoke
rolled
over
the
dark
muddy
surface
of
the
river
a
cannon
roared
and
the
embankment
behind
which
lieutenant
lambert
and
his
men
were
lying
was
jarred
perceptibly
as
if
some
heavy
body
had
been
dashed
with
violent
force
against
it
the
profound
silence
that
followed
was
broken
first
by
shouts
and
cries
of
terror
from
the
negroes
on
the
bank
who
scattered
in
all
directions
then
by
a
muffled
sound
something
like
the
puff
of
a
tired
locomotive
on
an
up
grade
and
lambert
view
of
the
river
was
shut
off
by
a
cloud
of
dirt
and
smoke
that
was
thrown
high
into
the
air
by
the
explosion
of
the
shell
that
had
buried
itself
in
the
ground
at
the
base
of
the
levee
that
was
enough
for
the
home
guards
who
could
not
stand
so
much
noise
at
such
close
quarters
they
jumped
to
their
feet
and
fairly
tumbled
over
one
another
as
they
fled
for
safety
behind
the
warehouses
where
they
had
left
their
horses
but
even
here
vengeance
pursued
them
for
the
next
shell
that
came
from
the
war
vessel
crashed
through
the
walls
of
the
nearest
house
scattering
bricks
and
mortar
about
their
ears
creating
a
panic
among
their
untrained
steeds
and
finally
exploding
in
the
edge
of
the
woods
half
a
mile
away
by
gum
boys
jump
on
and
get
outen
here
shouted
lambert
who
wished
from
the
bottom
of
his
heart
that
he
could
be
the
first
to
obey
his
own
order
beats
the
world
how
straight
they
can
shoot
with
them
big
guns
of
theirn
they
win
more
turkeys
at
a
shooting
match
than
the
best
man
among
us
for
a
few
brief
perilous
moments
the
terrified
horses
refused
to
stand
still
long
enough
for
their
equally
terrified
owners
to
mount
but
when
after
many
fruitless
efforts
the
home
guards
succeeded
in
placing
themselves
in
their
saddles
the
stampede
that
followed
was
something
we
can
not
describe
they
galloped
frantically
along
the
road
that
ran
behind
the
levee
through
the
streets
of
the
town
which
were
by
this
time
filled
with
pale
and
excited
citizens
who
could
not
imagine
what
the
trouble
was
about
and
did
not
know
which
way
to
run
for
safety
and
so
out
into
the
country
where
the
avenging
shells
could
not
reach
them
a
confederate
veteran
who
was
present
and
witnessed
the
bombardment
told
the
writer
that
the
home
guards
deliberately
rode
into
the
midst
of
the
fleeing
inhabitants
selecting
groups
of
terrified
women
and
children
into
whom
they
galloped
trampling
many
of
them
under
the
feet
of
their
horses
trusting
that
the
humane
and
chivalrous
who
had
been
so
lenient
with
the
insulting
rabble
at
new
orleans
would
not
follow
them
with
their
fire
we
believe
this
to
be
nothing
but
the
truth
but
whether
it
is
or
not
the
fact
remains
that
lambert
and
his
men
kept
to
the
crowded
streets
as
long
as
they
could
and
the
bursting
shells
followed
them
through
every
turn
they
made
but
unfortunately
without
doing
them
the
least
damage
those
who
ought
to
have
been
severely
punished
got
off
scot
free
while
the
innocent
inhabitants
suffered
in
wounds
and
loss
of
property
for
their
town
was
set
on
fire
in
half
a
dozen
different
places
the
home
guards
spread
the
utmost
consternation
among
the
farmers
who
lived
along
the
line
of
their
hurried
flight
and
who
ran
out
to
the
road
and
vainly
implored
the
frantic
horsemen
to
draw
rein
long
enough
to
tell
them
what
the
firing
was
about
and
if
the
yankees
were
coming
at
last
to
burn
them
out
of
house
and
home
but
it
was
not
until
the
roar
of
the
big
guns
ceased
entirely
and
the
home
guards
were
satisfied
that
they
had
ridden
beyond
the
reach
of
any
stray
shell
which
might
be
sent
after
them
that
those
who
were
leading
in
the
retreat
recovered
their
courage
sufficiently
to
slacken
their
speed
so
that
their
comrades
in
the
rear
could
come
up
then
they
were
willing
to
talk
to
the
planters
along
the
road
but
it
is
doubtful
if
they
gave
them
much
reliable
information
in
response
to
one
frightened
hurried
inquiries
lieutenant
lambert
said
we
uns
have
been
in
just
the
worst
fight
we
ever
was
in
before
in
all
our
born
days
and
if
anybody
but
me
had
been
in
command
the
most
of
us
would
have
left
our
bones
there
behind
the
levee
it
was
awful
to
see
the
way
them
yanks
fired
into
them
women
and
children
but
what
started
the
rucus
in
the
first
place
asked
the
planter
who
rebel
that
he
was
could
not
believe
that
the
had
turned
demons
all
on
a
sudden
what
have
you
mooreville
ruffians
who
have
any
business
in
this
part
of
the
country
anyway
been
doing
in
the
city
you
better
ask
what
them
baton
rouge
yankees
been
doing
retorted
lambert
hotly
we
state
troops
and
we
got
business
in
every
part
of
the
country
that
we
please
to
go
and
when
it
pleases
the
baton
rouge
people
to
start
a
nest
of
yankee
sympathizers
in
there
our
bounden
duty
to
go
in
and
break
it
up
and
that
just
what
we
have
done
we
drove
the
enemy
away
and
the
mississippi
between
new
orleans
and
memphis
belongs
to
we
uns
once
more
we
a
whopped
we
did
if
it
had
been
for
ike
spencer
who
let
his
gun
shoot
itself
off
before
the
rest
of
us
were
ready
i
reckon
he
feels
kinder
sneakin
over
it
fur
i
aint
seen
him
since
i
should
think
you
would
all
feel
sneaking
answered
the
planter
as
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
moved
away
if
you
have
kicked
up
a
row
on
the
river
i
hope
you
will
suffer
for
it
we
had
peace
and
quiet
in
this
part
of
the
country
for
a
few
weeks
back
and
now
you
have
gone
and
brought
war
and
all
its
miseries
on
us
again
the
last
one
of
you
ought
to
be
hanged
lieutenant
lambert
and
his
home
guards
were
amazed
to
find
that
this
angry
citizen
voiced
the
sentiments
of
all
the
people
who
lived
on
the
mooreville
road
and
after
a
few
more
planters
had
talked
to
them
in
this
plain
fashion
their
eyes
were
opened
to
the
disagreeable
fact
that
they
had
damaged
their
own
cause
a
great
deal
more
than
they
had
hurt
the
enemy
and
that
if
their
friends
and
neighbors
felt
the
same
way
toward
them
the
fire
that
had
been
poured
into
their
ranks
by
the
gunboats
was
nothing
to
what
they
would
have
to
stand
when
they
reached
home
when
they
came
to
think
it
all
over
they
were
the
maddest
lot
of
men
that
had
ever
been
seen
in
that
part
of
the
country
they
blamed
their
lieutenant
for
being
the
cause
of
it
and
swore
at
him
so
lustily
that
he
fell
behind
and
rode
alone
putting
in
his
time
by
wishing
a
good
many
heavy
penalties
to
the
address
of
his
friend
abner
who
after
the
experience
he
had
had
with
yankees
ought
to
have
known
better
than
to
advise
him
to
pester
the
gunboats
all
the
home
guards
rode
slowly
so
as
to
reach
the
outskirts
of
mooreville
a
little
after
nightfall
and
then
they
separated
and
slunk
away
toward
their
respective
homes
like
who
had
been
playing
truant
but
the
news
had
got
ahead
of
them
and
an
indignation
meeting
was
being
held
in
the
dining
room
of
the
hotel
some
of
the
mooreville
people
captain
randolph
among
the
number
had
seen
and
talked
with
men
who
lived
down
the
river
road
and
had
heard
the
roar
of
the
big
guns
and
mounted
messengers
had
been
sent
to
the
city
to
learn
what
the
firing
was
about
these
men
who
had
fast
horses
and
went
across
lots
rode
all
the
way
at
top
speed
and
to
such
good
purpose
that
they
returned
to
mooreville
about
two
hours
before
the
home
guards
came
straggling
in
and
the
story
they
told
to
the
crowd
at
the
hotel
raised
such
a
storm
of
indignation
that
for
a
while
things
looked
serious
in
the
meantime
and
to
make
matters
worse
the
news
spread
through
the
country
round
about
and
armed
planters
came
flocking
in
to
lend
assistance
in
driving
back
the
force
that
was
supposed
to
be
advancing
upon
mooreville
and
the
climax
was
reached
when
wagons
began
arriving
from
the
direction
of
the
river
drawn
by
panting
mules
that
had
been
driven
until
they
were
almost
exhausted
and
loaded
with
the
families
and
household
effects
of
the
frightened
owners
who
were
fleeing
before
the
invading
federals
of
course
the
very
meagre
information
these
people
brought
added
to
the
excitement
and
alarm
for
there
were
not
two
among
them
who
told
the
same
story
they
expected
to
find
the
town
deserted
by
its
inhabitants
and
were
much
surprised
to
discover
that
it
was
not
it
no
use
for
you
fellows
to
think
of
standing
against
them
exclaimed
one
trembling
driver
who
carried
in
his
hand
a
frayed
which
he
had
worn
out
over
his
mules
backs
butler
is
coming
with
his
whole
army
did
you
see
them
inquired
gray
who
had
ridden
in
with
ned
griffin
for
a
companion
they
were
both
armed
and
although
they
did
not
believe
in
shooting
at
those
who
carried
the
old
flag
they
were
ready
to
do
what
they
could
to
protect
their
homes
yes
sir
i
saw
them
replied
the
man
earnestly
i
had
left
my
house
a
quarter
of
a
mile
behind
before
i
discovered
some
of
their
cavalry
riding
along
one
of
my
lanes
i
suppose
my
house
is
in
ashes
by
this
time
were
they
burning
things
as
they
came
asked
one
of
neighbors
there
was
the
blackest
smoke
over
toward
the
river
that
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
was
the
answer
baton
rouge
is
gone
up
you
better
leave
while
you
can
you
may
save
your
lives
but
you
ca
save
your
property
get
along
there
mule
me
and
mine
will
take
to
the
brush
every
story
to
which
gray
and
ned
griffin
listened
was
more
thrilling
than
the
one
that
came
before
it
among
others
they
found
a
man
who
lived
in
the
outskirts
of
the
city
and
who
standing
in
his
back
door
had
seen
a
bench
which
supported
stands
of
bees
demolished
by
a
shell
from
the
gunboats
still
another
had
fled
from
his
house
just
in
time
to
escape
capture
by
butler
advance
infantry
which
was
moving
up
the
road
in
platoon
front
and
more
than
that
the
highway
was
blue
with
federals
as
far
as
his
eye
could
reach
of
course
such
tales
as
these
frightened
some
of
the
mooreville
people
but
gray
assured
his
young
companion
that
he
put
very
little
reliance
upon
them
these
folks
are
not
responsible
for
what
they
tell
us
because
they
are
scared
out
of
their
wits
was
what
he
said
to
ned
griffin
more
than
once
what
would
the
federals
gain
by
capturing
or
destroying
two
little
towns
like
baton
rouge
and
mooreville
if
there
was
a
fort
or
a
body
of
confederate
troops
here
i
might
put
some
faith
in
these
rumors
but
now
i
do
when
our
couriers
return
we
shall
have
the
straight
of
the
story
and
not
before
have
you
seen
anything
of
our
home
guards
who
ought
to
be
mustering
for
our
defence
no
ned
had
seen
them
and
when
he
came
to
ride
about
the
town
and
make
inquiries
he
could
not
find
anybody
else
who
had
seen
them
the
truth
was
they
were
too
badly
frightened
to
show
themselves
for
they
were
afraid
that
they
might
be
called
upon
to
do
something
captain
tom
uniform
was
in
its
old
hiding
place
in
the
garret
and
tom
himself
was
stretched
out
on
the
lounge
in
his
mother
room
eager
for
news
and
dreading
to
hear
it
but
too
ill
to
mount
his
horse
and
muster
his
men
for
the
defence
of
the
town
at
length
two
of
the
mooreville
messengers
returned
and
then
the
citizens
got
the
straight
of
the
story
when
they
learned
that
general
butler
army
had
not
moved
out
of
new
orleans
at
all
that
not
a
federal
soldier
had
stepped
upon
the
sacred
soil
of
louisiana
in
the
neighborhood
of
baton
rouge
during
the
whole
of
that
day
and
that
the
city
had
been
shelled
and
partially
burned
because
lieutenant
lambert
of
tom
randolph
home
guards
had
tried
to
gain
a
little
cheap
notoriety
for
himself
by
firing
upon
an
unarmed
the
citizens
heard
this
their
fear
give
way
to
the
wildest
rage
and
if
they
could
have
got
their
hands
upon
lambert
at
that
moment
it
is
more
than
probable
that
they
would
have
handled
him
roughly
with
one
accord
the
crowd
surged
up
the
steps
that
led
to
the
hotel
porch
and
through
the
wide
hall
into
the
dining
room
which
was
quickly
filled
with
men
who
had
about
made
up
their
minds
that
the
home
guards
had
made
them
trouble
enough
and
that
it
would
be
a
good
plan
to
get
rid
of
them
without
loss
of
time
of
all
the
senseless
acts
i
ever
heard
of
this
last
one
of
is
the
beat
shouted
an
excited
individual
who
had
perched
himself
upon
one
of
the
tables
those
baton
rouge
people
knew
what
they
wanted
and
if
it
suited
them
to
make
friends
with
the
yankees
and
trade
with
them
we
planters
have
no
business
to
find
any
fault
with
them
for
it
i
would
have
done
the
same
thing
myself
oh
you
traitor
shouted
a
voice
from
the
farther
end
of
the
dining
room
would
you
hold
communication
with
the
enemies
of
your
flag
yon
shut
up
bill
cummings
retorted
the
speaker
if
i
am
a
traitor
you
another
you
got
a
sack
of
federal
salt
and
some
federal
tea
and
coffee
hidden
in
one
of
your
corn
cribs
at
this
moment
and
i
can
prove
it
you
got
them
by
trading
a
beef
to
one
of
the
gunboats
down
there
at
baton
rouge
and
you
brought
them
home
in
your
wagon
at
dead
of
night
when
you
thought
all
your
neighbors
were
fast
asleep
this
raised
a
shout
of
laughter
at
the
expense
of
bill
cummings
but
no
one
said
a
harsh
word
to
him
for
probably
there
were
not
a
dozen
men
in
the
room
who
would
not
have
been
glad
to
get
some
of
that
salt
and
tea
and
coffee
gray
himself
was
standing
in
a
pair
of
federal
brogans
and
the
man
next
him
wore
a
straw
hat
that
looked
exactly
like
those
that
uncle
sam
issued
to
his
sailors
every
month
now
then
continued
the
man
who
had
taken
possession
of
the
table
i
am
in
favor
of
taking
that
ruffian
lambert
out
of
his
bed
if
he
has
had
time
to
get
there
and
giving
him
such
a
whipping
that
he
get
over
it
as
long
as
the
war
lasts
let
hang
him
and
be
done
with
him
cried
another
and
while
we
are
dealing
with
lambert
do
let
forget
tom
randolph
shouted
a
third
tom
randolph
is
in
no
way
to
blame
for
what
happened
at
baton
rouge
said
gray
who
was
one
of
the
few
cool
and
reasonable
men
there
were
in
the
crowd
he
has
no
more
authority
over
the
home
guards
than
i
have
then
i
say
let
lick
him
because
he
has
some
authority
over
them
so
that
he
can
make
them
behave
themselves
what
did
he
organize
the
company
for
anyhow
that
is
what
i
should
like
to
know
now
mark
my
words
there
will
be
a
yankee
garrison
in
baton
rouge
in
less
than
a
week
and
then
our
trading
will
be
up
stump
for
we
ca
go
there
any
more
that
so
what
excuse
has
that
man
lambert
for
living
i
like
to
know
let
him
and
the
home
guards
up
right
here
and
now
uttering
wild
yells
of
approval
with
which
were
mingled
loud
calls
for
ropes
and
dire
threats
against
the
peace
of
mind
and
bodily
comfort
of
captain
tom
randolph
the
crowd
made
a
rush
for
the
door
and
it
was
several
minutes
before
gray
and
the
men
who
sided
with
him
could
make
themselves
heard
above
the
tumult
be
reasonable
gentlemen
urged
the
former
do
let
your
excitement
lead
you
to
do
something
you
will
be
heartily
ashamed
of
and
sorry
for
you
can
not
touch
those
men
in
the
way
you
suggest
especially
tom
randolph
who
is
a
state
officer
whoop
and
yell
about
it
all
you
please
he
continued
after
the
angry
shouts
of
dissent
which
these
words
called
forth
had
subsided
but
it
is
a
fact
that
tom
holds
a
commission
from
the
governor
and
if
you
put
your
hands
on
him
you
will
go
to
jail
to
pay
for
it
confederate
officers
might
deal
with
him
though
on
that
point
i
am
not
sure
but
private
citizens
certainly
can
not
these
warning
words
caused
a
dissension
in
the
ranks
of
the
lynchers
at
once
and
the
hubbub
that
arose
all
over
the
room
as
well
as
from
the
outside
where
there
was
a
respectable
gathering
that
had
not
been
able
to
gain
admittance
to
the
dining
hall
was
almost
deafening
gray
looked
troubled
as
he
saw
his
angry
neighbors
swaying
back
and
forth
and
shaking
their
clenched
hands
in
one
another
faces
and
presently
he
stooped
and
whispered
a
few
hasty
words
to
ned
griffin
who
after
a
terrific
struggle
managed
to
work
his
way
through
the
crowd
to
the
nearest
window
by
which
he
made
his
exit
from
the
building
he
was
charged
with
an
important
duty
and
he
was
anxious
to
discharge
it
without
loss
of
time
but
the
men
on
the
outside
insisted
on
detaining
him
until
he
told
what
was
going
on
in
the
dining
room
honor
bright
there
is
anything
going
on
in
there
that
would
interest
you
or
anybody
else
declared
ned
who
knew
full
well
that
it
would
never
do
to
say
that
there
was
some
talk
of
lynching
lieutenant
lambert
and
up
tom
randolph
gray
has
been
quoting
some
law
that
all
let
me
go
please
i
want
to
tell
gray
that
the
excitement
is
all
over
the
men
released
him
and
ned
made
his
way
to
the
hitching
rack
where
he
had
left
his
horse
mounted
and
galloped
off
he
made
a
great
show
of
riding
down
the
road
toward
gray
house
but
as
soon
as
he
thought
he
could
do
so
without
attracting
attention
he
turned
back
and
went
at
top
speed
toward
the
plantation
on
which
lieutenant
lambert
found
employment
as
overseer
paying
no
heed
to
the
small
army
of
dogs
that
came
out
to
dispute
his
advance
he
rode
close
to
the
door
of
the
overseer
house
there
being
no
porch
to
bar
his
way
and
tapped
lightly
upon
it
with
the
handle
of
his
if
he
had
made
a
good
deal
of
noise
it
is
probable
that
he
would
not
have
received
any
response
from
the
solitary
occupant
of
the
building
who
was
thoroughly
frightened
at
what
he
had
done
but
totally
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
his
life
would
be
in
danger
if
gray
and
his
friends
failed
in
their
efforts
to
control
the
mob
at
the
hotel
the
cautious
way
in
which
his
visitor
strove
to
attract
his
attention
told
him
that
there
was
something
afoot
and
he
thought
it
best
to
answer
who
there
he
demanded
his
voice
sounding
as
if
it
came
from
under
the
bedclothes
it
griffin
was
the
reply
come
to
the
door
so
that
i
can
say
a
word
to
you
without
fear
of
being
overheard
and
be
quick
about
it
there
not
an
instant
to
lose
this
startling
announcement
brought
lambert
out
of
bed
and
to
the
door
which
he
opened
just
wide
enough
to
make
sure
that
his
visitor
was
ned
griffin
and
nobody
else
and
then
he
opened
it
so
that
he
could
put
his
head
out
and
look
up
and
down
the
lane
that
ran
by
the
house
to
the
negro
quarter
i
am
alone
ned
assured
him
without
waiting
to
be
questioned
and
i
am
here
because
gray
sent
me
do
you
know
what
you
have
done
by
this
day
work
you
have
destroyed
a
good
portion
of
baton
rouge
and
got
every
white
man
in
the
settlement
down
on
you
i
began
lambert
who
was
profoundly
astonished
i
am
not
here
to
argue
the
matter
interrupted
ned
but
to
tell
you
that
there
is
a
mob
in
the
hotel
who
are
talking
strongly
of
laying
violent
hands
on
you
they
would
have
been
here
before
this
time
if
it
had
been
for
gray
and
a
few
others
who
do
believe
in
such
things
but
the
gang
was
about
equally
divided
when
gray
sent
me
to
warn
you
and
you
had
better
dig
out
they
are
as
likely
to
decide
on
one
thing
as
another
and
you
are
not
safe
in
this
house
great
smoke
gasped
lambert
when
he
began
to
comprehend
the
situation
where
shall
i
go
get
into
your
duds
and
draw
a
for
the
nearest
patch
of
timber
gray
may
be
able
to
hold
the
mob
and
he
may
not
so
i
say
again
that
you
had
better
dig
out
illustration
ned
griffin
warning
lambert
i
never
looked
for
you
to
be
so
good
to
me
ned
faltered
lambert
who
seemed
to
be
so
dazed
that
he
did
not
realize
the
necessity
of
acting
quickly
do
thank
me
thank
gray
said
ned
hastily
if
it
had
not
been
for
him
i
am
afraid
i
should
have
left
you
to
look
out
for
yourself
for
i
know
how
you
and
tom
randolph
have
been
working
against
me
but
you
ca
injure
me
now
and
so
i
can
afford
to
be
magnanimous
are
you
going
to
clear
out
or
not
yes
lambert
thought
he
had
better
take
a
friend
advice
and
seek
safety
in
flight
while
the
way
was
open
to
him
and
when
ned
heard
him
say
that
he
wheeled
his
horse
and
set
off
to
carry
the
same
warning
and
advice
to
another
party
whose
name
had
that
night
been
rather
unpleasantly
mentioned
in
connection
with
a
sound
thrashing
this
one
was
tom
randolph
who
heard
his
ring
at
the
door
but
lacked
the
courage
to
answer
it
for
something
told
him
that
he
would
hear
disagreeable
news
if
he
did
randolph
answered
the
bell
himself
and
the
words
he
listened
to
almost
drove
him
frantic
ned
did
not
tell
him
that
the
mob
had
threatened
to
whip
tom
for
as
he
afterward
said
he
could
get
his
consent
to
go
as
far
as
that
but
he
said
enough
to
put
randolph
into
a
terrible
state
of
mind
he
stamped
his
feet
on
the
gallery
shook
his
fists
over
his
head
and
wished
from
the
bottom
of
his
heart
that
every
member
of
the
home
guards
had
been
sent
to
the
front
and
killed
off
long
ago
and
then
he
went
in
to
tell
his
wife
about
it
and
leave
her
to
break
the
news
to
tom
in
any
way
she
thought
best
to
say
that
the
young
man
was
utterly
confounded
would
be
putting
it
very
mildly
he
was
terribly
frightened
of
course
and
angry
as
well
but
for
some
reason
or
other
he
did
not
seem
to
stand
so
much
in
fear
of
personal
violence
as
he
did
of
losing
his
commission
when
his
mother
had
repeated
word
for
word
the
conversation
that
took
place
between
ned
griffin
and
randolph
and
tom
had
asked
a
question
or
two
he
jumped
to
his
feet
and
charged
about
the
room
like
a
caged
wild
animal
there
is
a
man
in
the
world
who
has
half
the
trouble
i
do
he
said
almost
tearfully
that
idiot
lambert
has
broken
up
the
company
as
completely
as
though
the
yankees
had
come
in
and
captured
every
member
of
it
and
think
of
the
misery
he
has
brought
upon
the
baton
rouge
people
suggested
his
mother
i
do
care
a
picayune
for
the
baton
rouge
people
said
tom
in
savage
tones
they
ought
to
have
known
that
they
would
bring
themselves
into
trouble
by
being
so
friendly
with
the
yankees
but
all
the
same
lambert
showed
himself
a
born
fool
when
he
fired
on
that
gunboat
i
should
be
glad
to
see
him
and
every
man
who
went
with
him
conscripted
and
put
where
they
would
have
to
behave
themselves
if
i
could
only
get
others
to
fill
their
places
but
that
is
something
i
ca
do
and
if
i
lose
my
men
i
shall
have
to
throw
up
my
commission
or
go
into
the
army
when
i
meet
them
at
the
enrolling
office
in
the
morning
i
will
talk
to
them
in
a
way
they
will
remember
but
when
morning
dawned
upon
his
sight
after
a
restless
and
sleepless
night
the
captain
of
the
home
guards
had
several
other
things
to
occupy
his
mind
first
came
a
committee
of
twelve
stalwart
men
appointed
by
the
indignant
citizens
of
baton
rouge
who
called
at
randolph
house
to
inquire
what
tom
meant
by
sending
a
gang
of
ruffians
to
their
peaceful
city
to
bring
destruction
upon
it
and
death
and
wounds
to
its
quiet
inhabitants
in
that
wanton
useless
and
outrageous
manner
the
scathing
denunciation
and
threats
that
captain
tom
was
obliged
to
listen
to
before
he
and
his
mother
could
convince
the
visitors
that
he
was
in
no
way
to
blame
for
it
that
he
did
not
know
the
first
thing
about
it
until
it
was
all
over
and
that
the
home
guards
had
acted
on
their
own
responsibility
and
without
orders
from
him
were
things
he
never
forgot
and
the
only
way
he
could
pacify
the
committee
who
seemed
determined
to
have
revenge
upon
somebody
before
they
left
town
was
by
promising
to
turn
his
company
over
to
the
conscripting
officer
as
soon
as
he
could
get
to
his
office
tom
knew
when
he
said
it
that
his
home
guards
would
refuse
to
be
disposed
of
in
that
way
but
he
was
so
much
afraid
of
the
baton
rouge
men
and
so
anxious
to
see
the
last
of
them
that
he
would
have
promised
more
than
that
for
the
sake
of
inducing
them
to
leave
the
house
although
tom
did
not
know
it
until
afterward
the
committee
took
a
little
responsibility
from
his
shoulders
by
calling
at
kimberly
store
before
they
went
home
and
telling
captain
roach
in
the
hearing
of
some
of
the
home
guards
that
if
he
did
not
at
once
conscript
every
man
who
was
in
any
way
concerned
in
lambert
mad
act
they
would
petition
the
governor
to
remove
him
and
put
in
his
place
an
officer
who
would
attend
to
his
business
and
this
threat
of
theirs
was
what
brought
some
of
the
home
guards
to
captain
tom
house
where
we
found
them
at
the
beginning
of
the
first
chapter
chapter
vi
captain
roach
lays
down
the
law
as
soon
as
the
baton
rouge
men
with
their
lowering
looks
and
big
revolvers
were
fairly
out
of
sight
of
the
house
captain
tom
feeling
much
the
worse
for
the
exciting
ordeal
through
which
he
had
just
passed
went
into
his
mother
room
and
flung
himself
down
on
the
lounge
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
nothing
in
the
world
to
live
for
there
was
another
captain
in
the
confederacy
he
told
himself
whose
ambition
to
do
something
great
for
his
country
had
been
balked
and
defeated
at
every
turn
as
his
had
been
ever
since
he
took
command
of
the
home
guards
in
no
single
instance
that
he
could
think
of
had
his
men
conducted
themselves
as
he
thought
they
ought
or
as
he
was
sure
captain
hubbard
rangers
would
have
conducted
themselves
if
they
had
been
situated
as
the
home
guards
were
and
it
was
a
sad
disappointment
and
trial
to
him
already
he
repented
of
his
rash
promise
to
turn
his
company
over
to
the
enrolling
officer
for
by
such
a
proceeding
he
would
place
himself
right
where
he
was
before
the
governor
honored
him
with
his
is
to
say
without
any
standing
at
all
in
the
community
now
he
had
influence
and
he
was
not
ignorant
of
the
fact
it
was
very
gratifying
to
his
vanity
to
have
men
who
were
his
superiors
in
every
point
of
view
who
had
seldom
invited
him
to
their
houses
or
treated
him
with
anything
more
than
ordinary
was
very
gratifying
to
have
such
men
go
out
of
their
way
to
speak
to
him
and
to
see
them
listen
attentively
while
he
discussed
the
issues
of
the
hour
and
told
how
the
war
ought
to
be
conducted
on
the
confederate
side
the
most
of
these
men
in
their
hearts
despised
him
and
captain
tom
knew
it
but
they
were
aware
that
through
his
intimacy
with
captain
roach
he
was
able
to
hasten
or
postpone
their
conscription
just
as
the
humor
seized
him
and
for
this
reason
thought
it
prudent
to
treat
him
with
some
show
of
respect
but
if
he
gave
his
company
over
to
the
enrolling
officer
or
if
captain
roach
were
relieved
and
a
new
and
stricter
man
put
in
his
ow
yelled
the
persecuted
and
furious
captain
of
the
home
guards
when
these
dispiriting
reflections
passed
through
his
mind
and
with
the
words
he
sprang
from
the
lounge
to
the
middle
of
the
room
where
he
swung
his
arms
and
danced
about
like
one
demented
no
matter
what
i
decide
to
do
i
am
in
a
fix
but
i
never
give
up
my
in
this
world
i
am
the
biggest
toad
in
the
puddle
now
and
i
am
going
to
stay
that
way
or
else
i
go
to
baton
rouge
and
curry
favor
with
the
yankees
as
other
good
confederates
have
done
to
keep
out
of
trouble
jeff
davis
ca
reach
inside
their
lines
and
take
me
by
the
collar
and
drag
me
into
his
army
and
as
for
roach
if
he
gets
up
on
his
dignity
and
says
ugly
things
to
me
on
account
of
lambert
foolishness
i
let
him
know
who
he
is
talking
to
report
him
myself
incompetency
and
general
worthlessness
about
as
fit
to
be
an
enrolling
officer
as
adam
off
ox
at
any
rate
he
shall
never
sit
at
my
mother
table
again
and
he
can
bet
on
that
at
this
moment
randolph
who
had
done
so
much
to
help
captain
tom
through
his
trying
interview
with
the
baton
rouge
committee
hastened
into
the
room
looking
very
much
excited
and
distressed
my
dear
said
she
nervously
i
am
afraid
we
are
going
to
have
more
trouble
there
is
a
score
or
more
of
home
guards
in
the
road
coming
toward
the
house
and
they
are
talking
loudly
and
shaking
their
fists
at
one
another
as
if
they
are
very
angry
i
do
care
if
they
are
shouted
captain
tom
i
am
mad
too
as
i
have
good
reason
to
be
stand
by
me
and
see
how
i
will
talk
to
them
money
would
not
have
induced
captain
randolph
to
go
out
on
the
gallery
alone
to
meet
his
mutinous
soldiers
and
even
with
his
fearless
mother
at
his
side
to
support
and
encourage
him
he
felt
like
running
back
into
the
house
when
he
saw
them
coming
through
the
gate
and
heard
their
loud
angry
voices
whether
they
intended
to
do
him
personal
injury
tom
never
knew
for
certain
though
he
afterward
heard
it
hinted
that
they
did
but
he
was
much
gratified
and
relieved
to
observe
that
they
ceased
all
hostile
demonstrations
when
they
saw
his
mother
standing
by
his
side
on
the
gallery
and
that
emboldened
him
to
go
on
with
the
programme
he
had
laid
out
for
himself
you
are
a
pretty
lot
of
very
pretty
lot
indeed
was
the
way
in
which
he
went
at
them
i
am
heartily
ashamed
of
you
and
disgusted
with
myself
to
think
i
ever
consented
to
act
as
your
commanding
officer
do
you
know
that
you
have
done
us
and
our
glorious
cause
more
injury
than
farragut
ever
did
men
have
been
shot
to
death
in
the
army
of
the
centre
for
doing
less
than
you
have
done
and
now
i
am
going
to
put
you
where
you
will
be
served
in
the
same
way
the
first
time
you
misbehave
yourselves
i
shall
stand
your
foolishness
no
longer
the
field
is
the
place
for
you
and
there
where
you
are
going
as
soon
as
captain
roach
can
send
you
roach
ca
send
us
there
nor
you
neither
shouted
lambert
who
of
course
was
expected
to
act
as
spokesman
for
the
home
guards
we
are
swore
into
the
service
of
the
state
we
are
and
confedrit
officers
ca
touch
us
did
bob
hubbard
i
can
send
you
to
the
front
to
pay
you
for
what
you
did
yesterday
and
i
will
interrupted
captain
tom
there
are
no
such
useless
things
as
states
troops
any
longer
and
i
am
glad
of
it
ask
captain
roach
and
he
will
tell
you
that
you
are
here
only
because
i
asked
him
to
let
you
stay
and
that
if
the
camp
of
instruction
we
are
waiting
for
had
been
established
i
could
have
sent
you
there
any
day
i
pleased
i
have
been
standing
between
you
and
him
all
along
and
this
is
the
way
you
repay
me
you
ungrateful
blackguards
i
teach
you
to
play
the
part
of
fools
without
my
orders
lieutenant
lambert
rubbed
his
hands
nervously
together
shaking
his
head
and
swearing
softly
to
himself
the
while
and
fairly
ached
to
make
a
suitable
rejoinder
but
the
presence
of
tom
mother
of
whom
he
had
always
stood
somewhat
in
awe
restrained
him
we
uns
thought
you
was
dead
set
agin
the
yankees
and
that
you
would
be
sorter
glad
to
see
them
sailors
made
to
stay
on
their
boats
one
of
the
home
guards
ventured
to
say
at
length
what
business
had
you
to
think
anything
of
the
kind
demanded
captain
tom
a
soldier
whole
duty
is
to
obey
he
is
nothing
but
a
machine
and
his
captain
does
his
thinking
for
him
if
i
had
wanted
you
to
go
to
the
city
and
fire
on
those
gunboats
i
should
have
led
you
there
myself
lambert
you
alone
are
to
blame
for
this
miserable
state
of
affairs
and
i
will
tell
you
for
your
satisfaction
that
you
have
killed
your
chances
for
a
lieutenant
commission
deader
than
a
smelt
i
never
recommend
you
to
the
governor
by
gum
i
wo
stand
no
such
talk
as
that
yelled
lambert
he
sprang
into
the
air
and
knocked
his
heels
together
dashed
his
hat
upon
the
ground
and
placed
his
foot
upon
the
lower
step
as
if
he
were
about
to
rush
up
to
the
gallery
where
tom
was
standing
the
face
grew
as
white
as
a
sheet
but
he
could
not
think
of
yielding
ground
to
a
mutinous
subordinate
while
his
mother
was
looking
on
in
an
instant
the
sword
that
hung
at
his
side
flashed
from
its
scabbard
i
have
drawn
it
without
a
cause
said
he
shaking
the
weapon
over
the
railing
almost
in
lambert
face
and
i
warn
you
that
i
shall
not
sheathe
it
with
dishonor
that
is
my
motto
and
i
shall
live
up
to
it
no
matter
what
happens
to
me
any
more
such
actions
on
your
part
will
shut
you
up
in
the
on
a
bread
and
water
diet
it
is
not
likely
that
the
sight
of
tom
sword
or
the
threat
which
he
could
not
have
carried
out
had
any
effect
upon
lieutenant
lambert
who
was
a
noted
rough
and
tumble
fighter
but
a
glance
at
the
face
of
the
resolute
woman
who
stood
quietly
on
the
porch
above
cowed
him
at
once
randolph
did
not
say
a
word
nor
did
she
move
an
inch
when
lambert
acted
as
though
he
was
about
to
charge
up
the
steps
but
there
was
something
in
her
eye
that
brought
the
angry
man
to
his
senses
he
backed
away
from
the
steps
picked
up
his
hat
and
remarked
that
he
had
always
supposed
a
first
lieutenant
had
a
right
to
harass
the
enemy
in
any
way
he
could
but
he
was
rebuked
and
silenced
before
he
had
uttered
half
a
dozen
words
because
he
forgot
his
manners
and
addressed
his
commanding
officer
by
his
christian
name
captain
tom
was
not
slow
to
improve
the
advantage
he
had
gained
and
the
way
he
scolded
threatened
and
even
insulted
the
home
guards
would
have
made
a
regular
soldier
open
his
eyes
he
showed
them
that
they
did
wrong
when
they
followed
lambert
to
baton
rouge
without
orders
from
their
captain
and
drew
so
harrowing
a
picture
of
the
dangers
and
privations
of
the
army
life
to
which
they
had
doomed
themselves
by
their
acts
of
disobedience
and
folly
that
he
frightened
the
bravest
of
them
and
when
he
thought
he
had
impressed
them
sufficiently
he
wound
up
by
declaring
that
nothing
short
of
a
solemn
promise
on
their
part
to
do
better
in
future
would
induce
him
to
break
the
agreement
he
had
made
with
the
baton
rouge
men
if
they
would
take
orders
from
him
and
nobody
else
he
would
stand
between
them
and
all
harm
and
mark
my
words
this
is
the
very
last
warning
i
shall
give
you
said
captain
tom
in
conclusion
the
last
one
of
you
ought
to
be
and
shot
to
his
great
surprise
and
his
mother
lieutenant
lambert
stepped
forward
assumed
the
position
of
a
soldier
as
near
as
he
could
get
it
touched
his
battered
hat
respectfully
and
said
we
do
it
and
there
my
hand
on
to
it
if
miss
randolph
will
take
it
from
this
time
on
you
boss
and
do
nary
one
of
you
forget
it
lambert
object
was
to
restore
himself
to
the
favor
of
tom
mother
and
so
he
went
on
to
declare
with
some
emphatic
language
to
make
it
more
binding
that
he
spoke
for
the
company
and
would
take
it
upon
himself
to
see
that
the
promise
was
kept
he
was
sure
he
had
succeeded
in
his
object
when
randolph
smiled
and
shook
hands
with
him
over
the
railing
but
all
the
same
lambert
meant
something
very
different
from
what
he
said
captain
tom
made
a
enemy
when
he
drew
his
sword
on
his
second
officer
and
all
the
latter
wanted
was
an
opportunity
to
show
it
tom
then
dismissed
his
men
with
the
assurance
that
he
would
do
the
best
he
could
for
them
and
went
into
the
house
congratulating
himself
on
having
won
a
complete
victory
i
have
had
the
narrowest
escape
of
my
life
this
morning
were
the
first
words
he
said
to
his
mother
the
next
time
i
come
so
near
to
going
into
the
army
i
shall
go
and
that
will
be
the
last
you
will
ever
see
of
tom
randolph
did
i
bring
lambert
to
time
when
i
drew
my
sword
on
him
he
had
an
idea
that
he
could
run
things
to
suit
himself
but
i
think
i
showed
him
his
mistake
of
course
it
will
not
be
safe
for
me
to
go
near
baton
rouge
for
i
believe
the
citizens
would
mob
me
but
i
ca
be
sent
to
a
conscript
camp
so
long
as
i
have
men
to
command
and
that
is
what
i
am
figuring
on
now
half
an
hour
later
and
before
captain
tom
had
finished
telling
his
mother
and
himself
that
he
was
well
out
of
the
scrape
into
which
his
officious
lieutenant
had
brought
him
one
of
the
home
guards
rode
into
the
yard
with
a
note
from
captain
roach
in
which
the
latter
requested
tom
to
come
to
his
office
at
once
on
business
of
the
last
importance
the
young
man
was
frightened
again
but
the
idea
of
talking
over
matters
with
captain
roach
while
his
mother
was
not
by
to
support
him
was
not
to
be
entertained
for
a
moment
he
passed
the
note
over
to
her
after
he
had
read
it
and
said
almost
fiercely
to
the
bearer
tell
captain
roach
that
he
has
forgotten
i
am
his
senior
and
if
he
is
so
anxious
to
see
me
he
must
come
where
i
am
at
the
present
time
i
am
not
dancing
attendance
upon
him
or
anybody
else
one
moment
my
dear
randolph
interposed
a
written
invitation
demands
the
courtesy
of
a
written
reply
permit
me
to
answer
the
captain
i
will
show
you
the
note
before
sending
it
away
his
mother
went
into
the
house
and
captain
tom
said
to
the
home
guard
who
sat
on
his
horse
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
have
you
any
idea
what
roach
wants
of
me
i
reckon
it
something
or
about
them
men
from
baton
rouge
who
acted
like
they
wanted
to
things
replied
the
messenger
looks
to
me
like
the
feels
sorter
shook
up
over
what
they
said
to
him
and
that
he
got
himself
into
some
kind
of
a
muss
that
nobody
but
you
can
help
him
out
of
he
talks
like
he
going
to
send
we
uns
to
camp
can
you
shet
him
off
on
that
do
you
reckon
it
depends
entirely
upon
the
way
you
home
guards
conduct
yourselves
from
this
time
on
answered
captain
tom
impressively
roach
would
have
conscripted
you
long
ago
if
i
had
stood
your
friend
and
he
may
do
it
yet
if
you
follow
lambert
on
any
more
of
his
crazy
expeditions
i
did
foller
said
the
man
hastily
and
i
do
want
you
to
think
i
did
i
was
to
home
all
the
blessed
time
i
aint
caring
to
bother
the
yankees
so
long
as
they
let
me
be
and
lambert
he
wo
go
off
that
away
agin
he
was
purty
bad
skeared
last
night
what
at
inquired
tom
why
do
you
know
some
of
our
folks
went
down
to
the
river
yesterday
to
see
what
all
that
shooting
was
about
and
when
they
come
back
and
told
what
lambert
had
been
ole
man
gray
and
the
rest
of
was
that
mad
that
they
talked
of
hanging
lambert
up
to
a
tree
and
licking
you
like
you
was
a
nigger
captain
tom
reeled
as
if
the
man
had
struck
him
with
the
handle
of
the
heavy
riding
whip
he
carried
in
his
hand
and
grasped
at
the
veranda
railing
for
support
i
am
telling
you
nothing
but
the
gospel
truth
continued
the
messenger
not
a
little
surprised
at
the
effect
his
words
had
produced
upon
his
commanding
officer
and
i
thought
you
had
had
time
to
hear
all
about
it
they
was
a
mad
lot
of
men
down
to
the
hotel
last
night
and
when
i
seen
going
on
i
was
mighty
glad
i
had
went
with
lambert
and
the
rest
do
you
mean
to
say
that
old
man
gray
dared
to
talk
of
whipping
exclaimed
tom
who
could
hardly
believe
his
ears
was
it
lambert
he
spoke
of
no
it
was
you
and
he
was
the
only
one
who
spoke
of
it
nuther
replied
the
home
guard
they
was
all
mad
i
tell
you
and
some
of
them
was
for
hanging
lambert
i
wish
to
goodness
they
had
said
captain
tom
speaking
before
he
thought
that
is
to
say
i
wish
they
had
done
something
to
him
before
he
brought
me
into
all
this
trouble
was
that
what
frightened
him
you
mighty
right
and
he
took
to
the
bresh
as
soon
as
he
got
wind
of
it
but
he
come
out
this
morning
and
we
all
have
promised
to
stand
by
him
if
they
put
a
ugly
hand
on
one
of
the
company
we
uns
allow
to
burn
them
out
that
the
idea
cried
tom
who
never
would
have
thought
of
such
a
thing
himself
i
see
very
plainly
that
we
got
to
do
something
to
protect
ourselves
we
are
state
troops
and
if
these
cowardly
citizens
drive
us
to
it
we
will
treat
them
as
we
would
the
armed
enemies
of
our
country
if
we
could
only
get
at
them
we
begin
on
old
man
gray
and
never
let
up
until
we
destroyed
everything
he
got
no
man
who
dares
to
threaten
me
and
those
who
serve
under
me
shall
hold
up
his
head
as
sh
here
comes
my
mother
do
say
a
word
in
her
hearing
but
tell
lambert
i
see
him
after
a
while
and
arrange
a
plan
of
operations
with
him
just
then
randolph
came
out
on
the
porch
with
the
note
she
had
written
and
which
she
presented
for
tom
approval
it
was
not
written
in
his
name
but
in
her
own
she
said
she
regretted
that
her
son
did
not
feel
able
to
accept
the
captain
kind
invitation
owing
to
the
excitement
and
distress
of
mind
into
which
he
had
been
thrown
by
the
unfortunate
occurrences
of
the
last
few
hours
but
if
captain
roach
would
honor
her
by
coming
up
to
dinner
at
the
usual
hour
she
hoped
he
would
find
captain
randolph
so
far
recovered
that
he
would
be
able
to
talk
over
with
him
the
very
important
business
to
which
captain
roach
had
referred
in
his
note
the
result
of
this
piece
of
strategy
was
that
an
open
rupture
between
captain
tom
and
the
conscript
officer
was
avoided
and
when
the
latter
who
had
been
so
frightened
and
angered
by
the
threats
of
the
baton
rouge
committee
that
he
was
several
times
on
the
point
of
doing
something
desperate
came
up
to
dinner
at
the
usual
hour
he
was
the
same
pleasant
and
agreeable
fellow
he
had
always
been
but
he
found
captain
tom
lying
on
the
sofa
in
and
slippers
and
looking
the
picture
of
misery
before
he
advanced
to
take
the
limp
palm
that
tom
languidly
extended
he
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
asked
if
someone
had
been
laying
violent
hands
upon
him
to
be
candid
he
thought
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
tom
if
the
citizens
would
shake
him
up
a
little
no
sir
was
the
very
dignified
reply
physical
pain
would
not
do
a
randolph
up
in
this
way
it
is
purely
mental
anguish
and
my
honor
has
been
touched
i
little
thought
that
i
should
ever
permit
living
men
to
talk
as
those
baton
rouge
ruffians
talked
to
me
this
morning
without
promptly
calling
them
to
account
for
it
but
my
home
guards
were
clearly
in
the
wrong
when
they
fired
upon
that
boat
without
my
orders
so
what
could
i
say
or
do
captain
roach
who
had
had
plenty
of
time
to
cool
off
and
recover
his
courage
since
he
wrote
that
note
smiled
pleasantly
gave
tom
hand
a
cordial
shake
pulled
up
a
chair
and
said
that
the
committee
had
been
quite
as
savage
with
himself
as
they
had
been
with
his
friend
tom
and
that
he
had
thought
it
the
part
of
wisdom
to
comply
with
their
demands
when
he
saw
that
they
carried
revolvers
in
their
and
were
in
just
the
right
mood
to
use
them
he
said
that
he
had
conscripted
all
the
home
guards
except
tom
as
he
had
agreed
to
do
because
he
did
not
see
how
he
could
help
himself
it
would
be
very
little
trouble
for
the
baton
rouge
people
with
the
aid
of
rodney
gray
father
and
a
score
of
others
whose
names
the
captain
could
mention
to
keep
watch
of
the
way
things
were
done
at
the
enrolling
office
and
if
he
failed
to
keep
his
promise
they
would
be
sure
to
find
it
out
but
he
had
conscripted
the
home
guards
conditionally
if
they
would
behave
themselves
in
future
and
take
orders
from
their
captain
instead
of
their
first
lieutenant
he
would
not
send
them
to
camp
until
the
last
minute
and
not
at
all
if
he
could
help
it
but
the
first
man
who
kicked
out
of
the
traces
would
be
the
first
to
be
sent
to
the
front
lambert
and
the
rest
understood
this
perfectly
and
had
agreed
to
be
bound
by
his
decision
that
the
idea
cried
captain
tom
delighted
to
learn
that
at
last
he
had
his
refractory
men
right
where
he
wanted
them
that
the
way
to
bring
mutineers
to
time
there
will
be
no
more
trouble
of
this
kind
i
assure
you
for
i
talked
to
some
of
my
troops
very
plainly
this
morning
and
made
lambert
knuckle
in
a
way
that
would
have
surprised
you
if
you
could
have
seen
it
of
course
i
shall
have
to
steer
clear
of
baton
rouge
but
i
do
care
much
for
that
although
i
confess
it
nettles
me
to
feel
that
i
can
not
go
and
come
when
i
please
as
i
have
always
been
in
the
habit
of
doing
randolph
remained
in
the
room
long
enough
to
assure
herself
that
the
relations
existing
between
captain
roach
and
her
son
had
not
been
strained
by
the
events
of
the
morning
and
then
bestowing
an
approving
smile
upon
each
she
arose
and
went
out
whereupon
captain
tom
got
upon
his
feet
and
carefully
closed
the
door
behind
her
say
he
whispered
when
he
came
back
and
resumed
his
position
on
the
sofa
did
you
know
that
the
town
was
in
possession
of
a
mob
last
night
and
that
some
yankee
sympathizers
among
them
had
the
impudence
to
threaten
me
and
my
man
lambert
i
know
all
about
it
replied
captain
roach
an
expression
of
anxiety
settling
on
his
face
but
they
were
not
yankee
sympathizers
for
men
of
that
stamp
would
not
dare
open
their
heads
in
this
community
they
were
as
good
confederates
as
you
or
i
do
you
believe
any
such
stuff
exclaimed
tom
there
is
a
word
of
truth
in
it
i
know
that
rodney
gray
is
a
lowdown
private
in
our
army
he
is
considered
worthy
of
a
commission
but
his
loyalty
has
always
been
suspected
and
last
night
he
proposed
that
his
gang
of
blackguards
should
whip
me
and
hang
lambert
now
i
tell
you
that
a
man
who
talks
that
way
about
somebody
has
told
you
what
is
so
interrupted
captain
roach
such
a
proposition
was
made
last
night
but
gray
would
not
hear
to
it
he
and
a
few
others
talked
it
down
on
the
spot
well
it
a
good
thing
for
old
gray
that
he
did
and
if
he
knows
when
he
is
watching
his
own
interests
he
will
take
pains
to
keep
it
talked
down
said
captain
tom
fiercely
i
was
ready
for
him
and
if
you
had
told
me
what
you
have
he
would
have
lost
some
of
his
buildings
this
very
night
the
enrolling
officer
had
seldom
been
so
surprised
and
startled
he
looked
fixedly
at
tom
to
see
if
he
was
in
earnest
and
then
cried
out
in
alarm
do
you
know
what
you
are
saying
are
you
crazy
i
know
what
i
am
saying
and
i
am
not
crazy
was
tom
answer
i
have
been
threatened
with
a
nigger
punishment
and
i
never
will
rest
easy
until
the
man
who
proposed
the
thing
suffers
for
it
but
you
do
know
who
proposed
it
and
neither
do
i
no
matter
i
make
it
my
business
to
find
out
and
if
you
succeed
are
you
going
to
burn
some
buildings
i
am
most
decidedly
you
have
fully
made
up
your
mind
to
that
have
you
i
have
please
present
my
compliments
to
your
mother
when
she
returns
and
say
to
her
that
i
could
not
stop
to
dinner
exclaimed
captain
roach
rising
to
his
feet
and
reaching
for
his
cap
what
is
the
matter
with
you
where
are
you
going
in
such
a
hurry
tom
almost
gasped
i
am
going
to
my
office
and
the
first
hard
work
i
shall
do
after
i
get
there
will
be
to
put
it
out
of
your
power
to
ruin
yourself
and
your
father
and
mother
as
you
seem
bent
on
doing
answered
the
captain
and
there
was
a
look
of
quiet
determination
on
his
face
that
tom
had
never
seen
there
before
of
course
you
do
not
intend
to
do
this
incendiary
work
alone
you
have
got
pluck
enough
for
that
the
captain
added
to
himself
so
i
shall
make
all
haste
to
send
your
men
into
the
army
where
they
ca
help
you
they
will
be
the
death
of
you
if
i
do
and
must
i
let
a
man
talk
about
whipping
me
as
if
i
were
a
nigger
and
never
do
or
say
the
first
thing
about
it
cried
tom
throwing
himself
back
upon
the
pillow
and
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
i
am
not
made
of
that
sort
of
stuff
and
i
did
not
think
a
confederate
officer
would
advise
me
to
such
a
cowardly
course
what
would
you
call
a
thing
in
the
shape
of
a
man
who
would
sneak
up
on
another
property
in
the
dead
of
night
when
there
was
no
one
to
oppose
him
and
touch
a
match
to
it
exclaimed
captain
roach
hotly
would
you
call
him
a
coward
or
not
i
do
care
whined
tom
i
am
bound
to
have
revenge
on
the
man
who
dared
to
say
that
i
ought
to
be
whipped
and
i
wo
give
up
my
plan
you
have
to
take
the
consequences
and
if
you
do
promise
right
here
and
now
that
you
will
be
governed
by
me
in
future
i
will
go
out
of
this
house
and
never
enter
it
again
and
you
know
well
enough
what
that
means
i
am
not
going
to
let
you
send
me
to
the
army
in
disgrace
if
i
can
help
it
sit
down
a
minute
said
tom
seeing
that
the
captain
stood
ready
to
carry
out
his
threat
to
leave
the
house
i
do
see
how
the
burning
of
a
or
two
will
disgrace
you
or
anybody
else
yes
you
do
for
i
have
explained
it
to
you
more
than
a
hundred
times
gray
and
some
others
are
almost
ready
to
report
me
now
for
my
failure
to
make
you
and
your
worthless
men
take
your
chances
with
the
other
conscripts
and
the
minute
somebody
begins
to
lose
property
that
minute
i
shall
be
ordered
away
from
here
and
into
the
army
and
would
that
put
me
in
disgrace
i
like
to
know
what
the
use
of
my
being
captain
of
the
home
guards
if
i
ca
call
upon
my
men
to
protect
me
cried
tom
who
would
have
given
something
to
be
alone
for
about
five
minutes
so
that
he
might
have
found
relief
in
a
flood
of
tears
there
is
a
bit
of
use
in
it
replied
the
enrolling
officer
bluntly
except
that
it
keeps
you
out
of
the
army
with
my
help
your
commission
gives
you
no
authority
to
call
upon
the
members
of
a
state
organization
to
avenge
your
supposed
private
wrongs
do
you
sit
down
repeated
tom
i
will
when
i
have
your
promise
and
not
before
if
you
have
laid
your
plans
to
get
me
into
a
muss
with
the
governor
i
must
head
you
off
if
i
can
then
i
will
make
no
effort
to
wipe
out
the
disgrace
that
has
been
put
upon
me
as
long
as
you
remain
in
town
said
tom
very
reluctantly
but
after
you
leave
i
make
some
people
i
know
of
wish
they
had
spoken
of
captain
randolph
with
more
respect
now
sit
down
and
act
like
yourself
you
ought
to
go
straight
to
gray
and
thank
him
for
if
he
and
his
friends
had
not
stood
by
you
last
night
you
might
have
been
badly
treated
answered
captain
roach
placing
his
cap
on
the
table
again
and
resuming
his
seat
by
tom
side
you
and
i
do
not
want
to
go
into
the
army
and
you
must
see
that
in
order
to
keep
out
of
it
it
will
be
necessary
for
you
to
follow
a
different
course
from
the
one
you
have
marked
out
for
yourself
if
i
am
reported
for
neglect
of
duty
the
jig
will
be
up
with
you
then
i
must
lie
around
and
do
nothing
must
i
is
there
anything
else
you
can
do
with
safety
you
can
ride
about
the
country
at
the
head
of
your
home
guards
occasionally
just
to
let
the
union
men
see
that
you
are
keeping
up
your
organization
and
after
i
receive
word
that
the
camp
of
instruction
has
been
established
you
can
take
the
conscripts
there
as
fast
as
i
can
get
them
together
and
that
about
all
you
can
do
it
a
dog
life
compared
with
what
i
thought
a
partisan
life
would
be
growled
tom
and
perhaps
it
is
safe
for
me
to
ride
about
the
country
the
threats
that
were
made
against
me
last
will
amount
to
nothing
i
assure
you
interrupted
captain
roach
the
who
made
them
and
who
seemed
to
be
so
fierce
for
a
fuss
are
few
in
number
and
have
had
time
to
recover
their
senses
since
then
you
ca
find
a
man
in
town
who
will
say
that
he
was
willing
to
go
with
the
rabble
last
night
and
more
than
that
the
people
in
the
community
would
not
stand
by
and
see
a
mob
run
things
to
suit
themselves
you
saw
lambert
this
morning
did
you
well
he
goes
around
as
freely
as
he
ever
did
and
no
one
says
a
word
to
him
captain
tom
thought
of
the
compact
that
lambert
and
the
rest
of
the
home
guards
had
made
to
stand
by
one
another
in
case
of
trouble
with
the
citizens
but
thought
it
best
to
say
nothing
about
it
to
his
friend
roach
of
course
he
had
to
give
the
required
promise
over
and
over
again
before
the
conscript
officer
became
satisfied
of
his
sincerity
and
he
did
it
with
apparent
willingness
but
all
the
while
he
was
telling
himself
that
the
men
who
had
threatened
to
whip
him
as
if
he
were
a
nigger
no
matter
who
they
were
would
hear
from
him
some
day
and
in
a
way
they
would
not
like
it
took
a
great
load
off
his
mind
to
know
that
he
would
not
be
mobbed
as
soon
as
he
showed
himself
in
mooreville
in
fact
it
cured
his
excitement
and
distress
of
mind
in
a
very
few
minutes
and
when
his
mother
returned
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
he
had
discarded
his
gown
and
slippers
and
was
sitting
up
dressed
in
his
full
uniform
chapter
vii
a
perplexing
situation
when
captain
roach
went
to
his
office
that
evening
after
the
best
dinner
he
had
ever
eaten
in
that
house
tom
randolph
rode
down
with
him
and
before
he
had
gone
half
a
mile
was
able
to
tell
himself
that
he
had
been
borrowing
trouble
and
without
reason
he
saw
no
coldness
whatever
in
the
greetings
of
those
he
met
along
the
road
and
the
few
who
stopped
to
speak
with
him
about
the
occurrences
of
the
previous
day
declared
with
one
accord
that
they
did
not
lay
any
blame
at
his
door
but
the
way
they
denounced
and
threatened
lieutenant
lambert
was
a
pleasant
thing
for
tom
to
hear
that
man
election
was
legal
any
way
was
what
tom
always
said
in
reply
but
because
i
have
permitted
him
to
act
as
my
second
in
command
he
has
somehow
got
it
into
his
head
that
he
is
a
bigger
man
than
i
am
and
has
a
right
to
do
as
he
pleases
if
he
has
at
last
found
out
that
i
know
a
trifle
more
than
he
does
and
that
it
is
a
soldier
place
to
wait
for
orders
from
his
superior
it
will
be
a
good
thing
for
lambert
if
the
baton
rouge
people
want
those
gunboats
driven
away
from
their
town
and
will
send
me
word
i
will
go
down
and
do
the
work
for
them
as
it
ought
to
be
done
tom
knew
that
he
was
quite
safe
in
talking
in
this
lofty
way
for
he
had
learned
during
his
interview
with
the
committee
that
the
people
of
baton
rouge
would
not
look
kindly
upon
or
support
any
effort
that
was
made
to
drive
the
boats
away
as
long
as
they
were
let
alone
the
yankees
were
not
unpleasant
fellows
to
have
around
they
put
good
food
into
the
mouths
of
some
of
the
city
people
good
hats
and
shoes
on
their
heads
and
feet
and
good
money
in
their
pockets
and
were
on
the
whole
more
desirable
neighbors
than
their
own
enlisted
men
would
have
been
for
the
latter
had
nothing
to
give
in
exchange
for
garden
produce
and
milk
and
butter
and
eggs
but
the
energetic
manner
in
which
they
went
to
work
to
scatter
lambert
home
guards
proved
that
these
peaceable
gunboat
men
were
ready
to
fight
at
a
moment
notice
captain
tom
courage
and
importance
came
back
to
him
rapidly
when
he
found
that
the
situation
was
by
no
means
as
serious
as
he
had
supposed
it
to
be
and
when
he
saw
that
even
lambert
was
willing
to
acknowledge
his
authority
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
that
indignation
meeting
at
the
hotel
and
the
visit
of
the
baton
rouge
committee
were
the
best
things
that
could
have
happened
to
him
and
the
home
guards
he
found
lambert
in
his
usual
loafing
place
in
kimberly
store
indeed
the
man
was
afraid
to
go
very
far
away
from
there
for
there
was
no
telling
what
might
be
said
and
done
against
him
if
he
should
absent
himself
he
saluted
captain
tom
respectfully
and
followed
him
out
of
the
back
door
in
obedience
to
a
motion
of
his
finger
look
here
lieutenant
said
tom
when
they
were
alone
together
i
do
not
in
the
least
blame
you
for
saying
that
you
would
like
to
see
rodney
gray
father
burned
out
to
pay
him
for
what
he
said
against
you
last
night
somebody
been
on
me
exclaimed
lambert
looking
alarmed
i
never
said
no
such
stuff
oh
what
is
the
use
of
denying
it
to
a
friend
said
tom
with
most
unbecoming
familiarity
but
i
do
ask
whether
you
intend
to
burn
him
out
or
not
what
i
want
to
say
is
that
you
must
on
no
account
think
of
it
so
long
as
captain
roach
stays
here
if
you
do
you
will
get
him
into
trouble
with
the
governor
and
he
will
pay
you
for
it
by
sending
you
and
all
the
men
to
the
front
and
you
too
asked
lambert
he
ca
conscript
a
commissioned
officer
can
he
said
tom
in
reply
no
he
ca
do
that
and
if
you
will
promise
that
you
will
never
do
another
thing
without
my
express
orders
i
will
see
that
he
does
conscript
you
either
all
right
i
knuckle
to
you
that
what
i
said
this
morning
and
i
meant
it
i
move
when
you
say
the
word
and
not
before
if
you
had
made
that
sensible
resolution
long
ago
you
would
have
saved
yourself
and
me
from
insult
said
tom
looking
at
his
lieutenant
as
if
he
would
like
to
give
him
another
piece
of
his
mind
if
you
have
learned
that
i
am
the
head
of
the
company
i
am
glad
of
it
but
if
you
want
to
do
anything
to
old
man
gray
on
your
own
your
own
hook
i
that
is
a
matter
with
which
i
have
nothing
to
do
however
you
must
wait
until
roach
leaves
mooreville
so
saying
captain
tom
saluted
and
went
into
the
office
when
the
door
closed
behind
him
lambert
shook
both
his
clenched
hands
at
it
and
said
through
his
tightly
shut
teeth
that
a
matter
you
have
nothing
to
do
with
is
it
well
i
reckon
it
is
and
you
do
get
sile
lambert
into
a
furse
with
no
such
oily
words
as
them
i
know
what
you
want
mighty
well
but
i
just
aint
to
do
it
you
can
pester
ole
man
gray
yourself
if
you
feel
like
it
and
when
the
job
is
done
i
tell
him
where
to
find
the
chap
who
done
it
i
learn
you
to
keep
my
commission
from
me
and
pull
a
sword
on
me
besides
the
way
you
done
this
morning
by
gum
if
i
was
afeared
go
and
make
friends
with
the
yankees
the
way
the
baton
rouge
folks
do
i
risk
it
any
way
before
i
will
let
myself
be
conscripted
having
weathered
this
storm
without
suffering
very
much
damage
except
so
far
as
his
feelings
were
concerned
and
quiet
having
been
restored
in
the
community
captain
tom
settled
back
into
his
old
lazy
way
of
passing
the
time
and
waited
for
something
exciting
to
happen
the
first
news
out
of
the
ordinary
that
came
to
his
ears
was
that
baton
rouge
had
been
occupied
by
federal
troops
much
to
the
gratification
of
the
citizens
both
union
and
confederate
who
experienced
so
delightful
a
sense
of
security
when
they
saw
the
on
their
streets
that
they
forgot
all
about
the
mooreville
home
guards
and
never
took
the
trouble
to
inquire
whether
they
had
been
conscripted
or
not
but
captain
roach
looked
grave
and
well
he
might
he
had
issued
an
order
to
the
effect
that
those
he
had
conscripted
must
report
at
his
office
at
least
once
in
every
hours
to
show
that
they
were
still
on
hand
and
ready
to
receive
marching
orders
but
on
the
day
the
news
came
that
the
yankees
had
garrisoned
the
city
only
fifteen
out
of
presented
themselves
of
their
number
had
left
home
and
friends
behind
and
sought
refuge
in
the
city
this
is
a
pretty
state
of
affairs
exclaimed
tom
when
captain
roach
told
him
of
it
those
men
are
not
worthy
to
be
called
southerners
before
i
would
show
myself
so
cowardly
i
would
go
somewhere
and
hang
myself
what
will
you
do
with
them
when
they
come
back
they
not
come
back
replied
the
enrolling
officer
they
will
stay
where
they
are
safe
and
no
doubt
desertions
will
be
of
daily
occurrence
as
long
as
the
yankees
remain
in
the
city
would
it
be
a
good
plan
for
me
to
go
down
there
and
harass
them
by
driving
in
their
pickets
now
and
then
inquired
tom
he
did
not
know
exactly
what
was
meant
by
driving
in
an
enemy
pickets
but
he
had
read
in
the
papers
that
it
was
often
done
by
the
soldiers
in
both
armies
what
good
would
it
do
asked
captain
roach
why
the
enemy
would
stay
where
they
were
bushwhacked
every
time
they
showed
themselves
would
they
a
few
determined
men
could
torment
them
as
the
buffalo
gnats
torment
our
stock
you
must
be
a
lunatic
or
take
me
for
one
was
what
captain
roach
said
in
reply
why
ca
you
be
content
to
let
the
yankees
alone
so
long
as
they
are
willing
to
let
us
alone
if
you
should
fire
on
their
pickets
they
would
send
their
cavalry
all
through
the
country
about
here
and
there
no
telling
how
much
damage
they
would
do
do
you
think
they
have
brought
cavalry
with
them
cried
tom
a
most
alarming
thought
suggesting
itself
to
him
at
the
moment
why
of
course
they
want
to
know
what
is
going
on
outside
the
city
do
they
and
how
are
they
to
find
out
except
through
their
cavalry
you
may
see
in
mooreville
before
sundown
you
stay
at
home
and
mind
your
business
for
i
hope
to
have
use
for
you
presently
do
you
mean
that
you
hope
to
send
me
off
with
some
conscripts
that
is
what
i
mean
i
shall
have
to
report
these
desertions
and
perhaps
it
will
open
the
eyes
of
the
state
enrolling
officer
to
the
fact
that
he
ought
to
have
had
that
camp
of
instruction
in
full
blast
long
ago
but
suppose
a
squad
of
yankee
cavalry
should
intercept
me
on
the
road
said
tom
in
a
trembling
voice
then
you
would
have
to
fight
that
all
if
you
whipped
them
it
would
be
a
fine
thing
for
you
and
might
lead
to
promotion
if
they
whipped
you
they
would
release
your
prisoners
and
take
you
and
your
men
away
with
them
and
then
they
would
send
me
up
north
and
i
might
not
see
home
again
for
long
years
faltered
tom
and
everyone
in
the
office
saw
that
he
was
badly
frightened
at
the
prospect
exactly
you
took
your
chances
on
that
when
you
accepted
your
commission
you
know
now
i
wish
you
to
go
to
work
on
your
men
and
see
that
they
are
in
some
sort
of
shape
when
marching
orders
come
there
will
be
guards
at
the
camp
and
i
hope
your
company
will
not
suffer
in
comparison
with
them
captain
tom
saw
very
clearly
that
his
connection
with
the
home
guards
was
not
likely
to
keep
him
entirely
out
of
reach
of
the
dreaded
yankees
and
when
he
looked
through
the
open
door
and
his
gaze
rested
upon
an
acquaintance
of
his
who
happened
to
be
passing
at
that
moment
another
alarming
thought
forced
itself
upon
him
it
was
ned
griffin
and
he
was
mounted
on
one
of
gray
blooded
horses
he
smiled
pleasantly
at
tom
nodded
to
the
home
guards
clustered
about
the
door
and
looked
on
the
whole
as
though
he
felt
well
satisfied
with
himself
and
with
his
lot
in
life
not
only
was
he
comfortably
settled
as
overseer
on
one
of
gray
fine
plantations
but
there
was
no
possible
chance
that
he
would
ever
be
forced
into
the
army
against
his
will
and
that
was
more
than
captain
randolph
could
say
for
himself
how
i
should
enjoy
knocking
that
beggar
out
of
his
saddle
said
the
latter
under
his
breath
then
he
bent
over
and
whispered
some
earnest
words
into
the
ear
of
the
enrolling
officer
look
here
roach
said
he
will
you
do
me
the
favor
to
keep
the
date
of
marching
a
secret
from
everybody
except
myself
i
be
glad
to
if
you
wish
it
but
i
do
see
how
i
can
said
the
captain
in
surprise
i
shall
have
to
notify
the
conscripts
themselves
wo
i
and
if
they
choose
to
publish
it
as
undoubtedly
they
will
in
order
to
give
their
friends
opportunity
to
come
to
the
office
and
bid
them
how
am
i
going
to
hinder
it
what
difference
does
it
make
to
you
anyway
it
may
make
all
the
difference
in
the
world
whispered
tom
that
fellow
who
just
rode
by
would
ask
nothing
better
than
to
send
or
take
word
to
the
yankees
where
they
could
capture
me
and
a
squad
of
conscripts
on
a
certain
day
whew
whistled
the
captain
if
he
does
that
i
arrest
him
and
ship
him
off
to
richmond
but
would
that
make
a
free
man
of
me
demanded
tom
impatiently
and
how
are
you
going
to
prove
it
on
him
that
so
and
when
it
comes
to
that
i
do
suppose
griffin
is
the
only
one
about
here
who
would
be
glad
to
see
you
and
all
the
home
guards
packed
off
to
a
northern
prison
the
only
thing
you
can
do
is
to
look
out
for
yourself
take
as
big
a
squad
with
you
as
you
can
muster
and
stand
ready
to
fight
your
way
captain
tom
was
almost
disheartened
but
made
one
more
effort
to
shirk
the
duty
to
which
until
this
particular
morning
he
had
looked
forward
with
the
liveliest
anticipations
of
pleasure
ca
you
ask
the
confederate
authorities
to
send
regular
troops
here
to
act
as
guards
and
leave
me
at
home
to
protect
the
town
said
he
desperately
he
knew
it
was
a
confession
of
cowardice
on
his
part
but
he
did
not
care
a
snap
for
that
protect
the
town
said
captain
roach
in
great
disgust
no
i
ca
yes
on
second
thought
i
can
but
it
will
end
in
you
and
the
home
guards
being
sent
to
the
front
the
captain
spoke
impatiently
and
jerked
a
sheet
of
paper
toward
him
on
the
desk
intimating
by
the
action
that
he
could
not
waste
any
more
time
with
his
friend
tom
just
then
and
the
latter
walked
out
of
the
office
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
slowly
homeward
something
was
forever
happening
to
upset
his
plans
and
this
last
trouble
was
all
the
fault
of
that
man
lambert
if
he
had
not
fired
upon
that
unarmed
boat
the
federals
would
never
have
thought
it
necessary
to
send
a
force
to
baton
rouge
and
captain
tom
could
have
escorted
his
conscripted
neighbors
to
the
camp
of
instruction
without
fear
of
coming
in
contact
with
the
cavalry
he
would
have
had
many
opportunities
to
show
his
fine
sword
and
uniform
to
soldiers
from
other
parts
of
the
state
and
could
have
talked
as
big
as
he
pleased
about
whipping
gunboats
in
a
fair
fight
he
had
hoped
to
gain
admirers
among
the
officers
stationed
at
the
camp
and
perhaps
he
could
have
himself
recommended
to
fill
the
commanding
officer
place
when
the
latter
was
ordered
to
take
the
field
but
that
all
past
and
gone
now
said
tom
as
he
saw
these
bright
hopes
disappearing
like
the
river
mists
before
the
rising
sun
if
the
yankee
cavalry
blocks
my
way
as
it
surely
will
if
ned
griffin
gets
a
chance
to
send
them
word
i
just
know
i
shall
be
captured
for
i
expect
raw
troops
like
my
home
guards
to
stand
against
veterans
i
wish
lambert
had
been
hanged
before
he
fired
on
that
boat
who
are
these
i
wonder
strangers
and
spies
i
bet
this
was
another
thought
that
troubled
him
and
if
there
had
been
a
branch
road
that
tom
could
have
turned
into
he
would
have
taken
it
rather
than
meet
the
two
civilians
he
saw
riding
toward
him
but
there
was
no
escape
and
so
he
kept
on
his
way
and
as
he
drew
nearer
to
them
his
eyes
began
to
open
wider
and
an
expression
of
amazement
came
to
his
face
he
recognized
the
horses
they
rode
and
the
clothes
they
wore
and
finally
it
dawned
upon
him
that
the
tanned
and
countenance
of
one
was
familiar
though
the
boy
to
whom
it
belonged
had
grown
wonderfully
tall
and
since
he
last
saw
much
so
in
fact
that
his
clothes
were
too
small
for
him
if
there
was
any
doubt
in
captain
randolph
mind
it
vanished
when
a
cheery
voice
called
out
hallo
tom
knew
the
voice
and
the
odious
name
by
which
he
had
been
addressed
it
was
the
one
with
which
his
mother
used
to
summon
him
into
the
house
in
the
days
gone
a
shrill
rising
inflection
on
the
last
syllable
his
first
thought
was
to
take
no
notice
of
the
greeting
or
to
make
an
angry
rejoinder
but
he
remembered
in
time
that
he
had
stood
in
fear
of
this
same
boy
when
he
was
several
pounds
lighter
than
he
was
now
he
looked
quite
formidable
as
he
sat
on
his
horse
and
no
doubt
during
his
fifteen
months
in
the
army
had
come
in
contact
with
some
rough
characters
and
gained
experience
and
skill
in
no
end
of
rough
and
tumble
fights
so
tom
thought
it
wise
to
be
civil
rodney
he
exclaimed
extending
his
hand
with
a
great
show
of
cordiality
you
do
know
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
back
safe
and
sound
how
long
have
you
been
at
home
just
three
days
answered
rodney
gray
for
it
was
he
and
this
is
my
old
schoolmate
dick
graham
who
lives
in
missouri
when
he
lives
anywhere
but
at
present
he
is
just
staying
wherever
night
overtakes
him
dick
and
tom
shook
hands
and
the
latter
continued
how
do
you
like
soldiering
i
suppose
you
have
seen
some
pretty
rough
times
in
the
army
oh
yes
but
nothing
compared
with
what
some
have
seen
dick
and
i
have
brought
our
usual
number
of
legs
and
arms
back
with
us
but
many
of
our
comrades
were
not
so
lucky
doing
anything
for
your
country
these
days
tom
if
he
had
any
ought
to
have
told
him
that
it
would
not
do
for
him
to
exaggerate
his
achievements
in
the
presence
of
rodney
gray
who
knew
him
of
old
and
had
seen
so
much
more
service
than
he
had
but
he
counted
a
good
deal
on
rodney
ignorance
and
dick
they
had
done
all
their
campaigning
in
the
interior
had
never
seen
the
mississippi
river
during
their
term
of
service
except
when
they
crossed
from
arkansas
to
tennessee
to
join
the
army
of
the
centre
and
perhaps
had
not
had
a
chance
to
read
a
newspaper
for
six
months
and
so
he
thought
he
could
say
what
he
pleased
and
they
would
believe
it
but
he
reckoned
without
his
host
i
have
been
very
busy
since
i
took
command
of
the
home
guards
he
said
in
answer
to
rodney
question
i
do
suppose
i
have
smelled
quite
as
much
powder
as
you
have
but
i
have
been
in
some
pretty
hard
battles
all
the
same
why
i
had
heard
of
it
said
rodney
looking
surprised
no
i
do
imagine
you
had
opportunity
to
read
the
papers
very
often
but
i
thought
perhaps
your
father
had
said
something
about
it
in
his
letters
i
have
whipped
two
heavy
two
which
exclaimed
dick
while
rodney
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
still
more
surprised
captain
tom
repeated
the
words
and
was
going
on
to
tell
about
the
fights
with
the
gunboats
when
rodney
interrupted
him
with
did
those
vessels
belong
to
the
upper
or
lower
fleet
i
do
know
replied
tom
but
they
came
up
from
new
orleans
then
they
were
not
you
may
rest
assured
of
that
do
i
know
an
when
i
see
it
cried
tom
angrily
i
have
it
from
good
authority
that
the
armor
on
their
sides
was
eleven
inches
thick
and
that
there
were
four
feet
of
solid
oak
back
of
that
great
moses
ejaculated
dick
there
is
a
vessel
in
the
yankee
navy
that
could
carry
such
a
load
as
that
farragut
has
done
all
his
brilliant
fighting
with
old
wooden
ships
and
there
are
no
in
his
fleet
unless
they
have
come
to
him
since
he
ran
past
forts
jackson
and
st
philip
that
so
assented
rodney
there
is
an
on
the
river
except
those
with
which
the
yankees
demolished
our
fleet
in
front
of
memphis
how
does
it
come
that
you
land
soldiers
know
so
much
about
what
is
going
on
here
on
the
river
demanded
captain
tom
who
was
very
much
astonished
at
the
extent
of
rodney
information
and
dick
oh
we
had
chances
to
read
the
papers
now
and
then
replied
the
latter
and
while
we
were
about
it
we
read
both
sides
chimed
in
rodney
our
officers
did
like
to
have
us
do
it
because
the
yankee
papers
tell
the
truth
while
our
own
do
not
scruple
to
lie
outrageously
when
things
go
against
us
captain
tom
did
not
know
what
answer
to
make
for
he
had
never
expected
to
hear
confederate
veterans
talk
like
that
he
began
to
have
a
suspicion
that
they
were
traitors
at
heart
but
he
prudently
kept
his
thoughts
to
himself
how
long
do
you
remain
at
home
he
asked
at
length
just
as
long
as
i
have
a
home
to
shelter
me
answered
rodney
and
when
the
yanks
come
in
here
and
burn
it
down
as
they
probably
will
sooner
or
later
i
shall
take
to
the
woods
i
am
sick
and
tired
of
the
service
and
i
do
care
who
knows
it
i
tell
you
i
felt
sorry
for
the
poor
fellows
i
saw
in
camp
pinckney
for
i
know
what
is
before
them
and
they
do
were
they
prisoners
inquired
tom
well
yes
but
they
did
go
by
that
name
they
were
called
conscripts
why
how
far
is
that
camp
from
here
said
tom
wondering
if
it
was
the
place
to
which
captain
roach
would
forward
his
conscripts
when
the
orders
came
about
miles
replied
dick
at
least
i
thought
it
was
that
far
before
we
covered
the
distance
that
lies
between
its
stockade
and
rodney
home
it
about
sixty
miles
as
near
as
i
can
judge
said
the
latter
have
you
and
what
his
men
enough
to
fill
up
a
squad
yet
father
says
you
have
been
working
at
it
for
a
good
while
captain
roach
has
mustered
some
men
but
has
had
no
orders
to
forward
them
in
fact
i
do
think
he
knows
that
the
camp
of
instruction
has
been
established
who
going
to
take
them
there
when
they
are
ready
to
go
i
am
said
tom
proudly
and
an
instant
afterward
he
felt
as
though
he
had
signed
his
own
death
warrant
there
was
no
chance
for
him
to
back
out
now
he
could
be
taken
suddenly
ill
or
send
lambert
in
his
would
have
to
go
with
the
conscripts
himself
for
that
was
what
he
in
his
haste
said
he
intended
to
do
and
if
he
did
not
keep
his
promise
this
old
enemy
and
rival
of
his
would
publicly
brand
him
as
a
coward
you
are
you
are
going
to
take
the
conscripts
to
the
camp
of
instruction
with
your
home
guards
cried
rodney
his
face
becoming
radiant
when
he
thought
of
the
obstacles
in
the
shape
of
soldiers
that
captain
tom
might
possibly
find
in
his
way
that
will
be
nuts
for
the
yanks
wo
it
dick
you
bet
there
tolerable
many
yanks
scattered
around
through
the
woods
and
like
as
not
your
friend
will
have
the
pleasure
of
meeting
some
of
them
do
you
mean
to
say
that
they
are
scouting
between
here
and
the
camp
exclaimed
tom
who
was
almost
ready
to
drop
when
he
heard
his
worst
fears
confirmed
in
this
positive
way
we
do
mean
anything
else
answered
rodney
we
ought
to
know
for
we
ran
into
a
squad
of
them
on
the
way
home
what
did
they
do
to
you
inquired
tom
who
did
not
know
whether
to
believe
it
or
not
nothing
they
just
covered
us
with
their
carbines
and
told
us
to
come
in
out
of
the
rain
and
we
came
humph
why
did
you
fight
or
run
well
seeing
that
we
had
no
weapons
we
could
fight
and
we
know
by
experience
that
when
a
yank
points
a
gun
at
you
and
tells
you
to
move
over
on
his
side
the
line
you
had
better
move
but
how
did
you
escape
we
did
escape
we
showed
them
our
discharges
and
when
they
told
us
to
git
we
got
oh
they
were
gentleman
high
up
assented
dick
i
never
yet
saw
a
yankee
who
was
a
gentleman
sneered
tom
look
here
exclaimed
dick
who
had
heard
a
good
deal
about
tom
randolph
and
learned
to
dislike
him
before
he
ever
met
him
have
you
much
of
an
acquaintance
with
live
mean
with
those
who
wear
uniforms
tom
was
obliged
to
confess
that
he
had
not
well
we
seen
and
talked
with
a
few
and
may
be
supposed
to
know
something
about
them
and
when
we
say
that
the
squad
who
captured
us
and
might
have
made
us
trouble
but
did
were
gentlemen
we
mean
it
if
we
ever
find
one
of
them
in
a
box
and
see
a
chance
to
help
him
out
we
intend
to
improve
it
but
as
you
have
no
discharge
to
show
you
had
better
not
permit
yourself
to
fall
into
their
hands
while
you
have
that
uniform
on
said
rodney
by
gracious
it
makes
my
old
hat
rise
to
think
how
i
should
feel
if
i
knew
i
was
going
to
be
ordered
off
to
that
camp
with
a
lot
of
conscripts
you
will
lose
your
prisoners
sure
and
your
home
guards
will
be
brushed
aside
like
so
many
cobwebs
if
you
get
through
with
a
whole
skin
we
shall
call
you
a
good
one
we
better
be
riding
along
dick
now
you
done
it
said
the
latter
as
he
and
rodney
moved
on
and
left
tom
out
of
hearing
you
have
frightened
him
out
of
his
wits
with
your
help
i
think
i
have
given
him
a
good
scare
was
answer
i
bet
you
a
month
wages
in
good
and
lawful
money
of
the
confederacy
that
tom
randolph
never
takes
a
squad
of
conscripts
to
camp
pinckney
i
know
i
should
hanker
after
the
job
if
i
were
in
his
place
as
to
tom
himself
he
was
about
as
badly
frightened
as
he
could
be
without
becoming
frantic
and
much
against
his
will
he
was
obliged
to
tell
himself
that
there
was
but
one
course
of
action
open
to
him
if
it
was
true
that
federal
scouting
parties
had
thrown
themselves
between
mooreville
and
camp
pinckney
he
must
run
the
fearful
risk
of
being
killed
or
captured
by
them
or
else
he
must
resign
his
commission
exchange
his
fine
uniform
for
a
citizen
suit
and
take
the
position
of
overseer
on
his
father
plantation
tom
wanted
to
yell
when
this
alternative
presented
itself
to
him
an
overseer
was
on
a
par
with
a
blacksmith
or
a
carpenter
or
a
clerk
in
a
store
he
had
to
work
for
his
living
and
was
in
consequence
a
nobody
and
tom
remembered
how
he
had
railed
at
ned
griffin
when
he
accepted
gray
offer
declaring
in
the
hearing
of
everyone
who
would
listen
to
him
that
nobody
but
a
poltroon
would
take
that
way
of
keeping
out
of
the
service
and
now
i
got
to
come
to
it
myself
or
get
shot
whined
tom
it
will
be
an
awful
come
down
for
a
man
who
has
held
a
commission
in
the
service
of
the
state
but
unless
mother
can
see
some
other
way
out
i
shall
have
to
do
it
captain
tom
wound
up
by
wishing
that
every
man
who
was
in
any
way
responsible
for
the
war
might
always
feel
as
miserable
as
he
felt
at
that
moment
chapter
viii
hounds
on
the
trail
why
tom
what
has
happened
to
make
you
look
so
pale
and
haggard
anxiously
inquired
randolph
as
the
perplexed
and
discouraged
captain
of
the
home
guards
drew
rein
before
the
door
and
rolled
out
of
his
saddle
instead
of
dismounting
in
his
usual
fashion
are
you
ill
or
have
you
heard
some
terrible
news
both
replied
tom
giving
his
horse
a
slap
to
start
him
toward
the
stable
and
afterward
throwing
himself
down
upon
one
of
the
steps
that
led
up
to
the
porch
who
do
you
suppose
has
come
back
to
town
to
worry
and
torment
me
i
hope
it
is
rodney
gray
said
his
mother
who
had
not
forgotten
that
the
barrington
boy
had
been
elected
to
office
and
presented
with
a
sword
by
bob
hubbard
rangers
while
her
son
was
left
in
the
ranks
although
she
never
said
so
out
loud
she
had
indulged
in
the
hope
that
something
might
happen
to
keep
rodney
away
from
mooreville
as
long
as
the
war
lasted
she
knew
that
he
had
faced
the
yankees
in
a
good
many
hard
battles
and
being
a
veteran
of
course
he
would
crow
over
tom
who
was
nothing
but
a
home
guard
well
it
is
rodney
gray
and
nobody
else
said
captain
randolph
in
a
tone
of
intense
disgust
he
looks
as
though
he
had
been
living
on
the
fat
of
the
land
for
the
citizen
clothes
he
discarded
when
he
went
into
the
army
are
much
too
small
for
him
he
has
brought
with
him
a
comrade
who
lives
in
missouri
and
who
i
judge
is
waiting
for
a
chance
to
get
over
the
river
and
he
about
the
most
impudent
chap
i
ever
talked
to
he
knows
more
about
gunboats
than
i
who
have
been
in
battle
with
them
have
you
not
learned
that
those
who
are
the
most
conceited
generally
know
the
least
but
you
are
not
obliged
to
associate
with
them
and
besides
you
ca
for
you
are
an
officer
and
they
were
nothing
but
privates
i
know
that
and
i
did
not
at
all
like
the
familiar
way
in
which
they
talked
to
me
they
gave
me
bad
news
they
were
captured
by
federal
cavalry
while
they
were
coming
home
tom
exclaimed
randolph
who
was
much
surprised
and
alarmed
to
hear
it
do
you
mean
to
say
that
our
enemies
are
scouting
through
the
country
that
what
i
mean
and
if
you
have
any
valuables
you
do
want
to
lose
you
had
better
be
taking
care
of
them
that
is
what
i
think
how
did
rodney
manage
to
escape
he
did
escape
the
yankees
read
his
discharge
and
let
him
go
free
and
that
chum
of
his
dick
graham
says
they
were
gentlemen
and
if
he
ever
sees
one
of
them
in
a
scrape
he
will
help
him
out
if
he
can
and
they
are
both
tired
of
the
war
and
do
mean
to
go
back
to
the
army
the
way
they
talked
was
shameful
and
i
will
speak
to
roach
about
it
the
very
next
time
i
go
to
the
office
tom
then
went
on
to
repeat
the
conversation
that
had
taken
place
between
himself
and
the
returned
veterans
and
by
the
time
he
got
through
his
mother
was
as
deeply
perplexed
and
as
badly
frightened
as
he
was
two
things
were
plain
to
her
rodney
and
dick
were
traitors
at
heart
and
ought
to
be
arrested
and
imprisoned
before
they
had
time
to
talk
to
any
of
the
conscripts
as
they
had
talked
to
tom
and
the
other
was
that
her
son
could
not
take
a
squad
of
men
to
the
camp
of
instruction
and
run
the
risk
of
being
captured
by
the
federal
troopers
now
that
i
have
had
time
to
think
of
it
i
do
care
whether
they
are
shut
up
or
not
answered
captain
tom
if
they
are
permitted
to
run
loose
in
the
settlement
and
to
talk
to
the
conscripts
as
they
did
to
me
they
may
frighten
them
into
deserting
to
baton
rouge
and
in
that
case
do
you
see
there
would
be
any
men
for
anybody
to
guard
to
the
camp
of
instruction
but
if
a
squad
is
sent
there
i
am
bound
to
go
in
command
of
the
escort
i
do
see
how
i
can
get
out
of
it
for
i
told
rodney
that
i
was
going
what
of
that
why
ca
you
send
lambert
or
let
captain
roach
go
in
your
place
if
you
can
think
of
any
excuse
i
can
offer
for
not
going
i
shall
be
delighted
to
hear
it
replied
tom
but
if
i
back
out
after
what
i
have
said
about
ned
griffin
cowardice
and
all
that
rodney
gray
will
never
let
me
hear
the
last
of
it
i
have
said
much
to
you
about
it
but
all
the
returned
soldiers
laugh
every
time
my
name
is
mentioned
in
their
hearing
and
make
sport
of
the
home
guards
because
they
are
willing
to
acknowledge
me
as
their
commander
and
i
believe
that
is
one
thing
that
makes
them
so
ready
to
rebel
whenever
i
issue
an
order
they
do
like
of
course
rodney
will
be
the
worst
of
all
for
he
never
liked
me
why
my
dear
boy
you
are
in
a
predicament
that
a
fact
exclaimed
randolph
who
had
never
dreamed
that
the
situation
was
as
bad
as
this
she
knew
that
tom
would
not
see
a
minute
peace
if
he
gave
the
common
people
of
mooreville
especially
such
low
fellows
as
the
returned
veterans
and
those
who
composed
the
rank
and
file
of
the
home
guards
any
reason
for
believing
that
he
was
lacking
in
courage
what
can
you
do
have
you
decided
upon
anything
i
have
not
that
is
something
you
will
have
to
do
for
me
as
far
as
i
can
see
there
are
but
two
courses
of
action
open
to
me
i
must
either
take
the
conscripts
to
camp
and
take
my
chances
on
being
shot
or
o
tom
i
never
consent
to
that
exclaimed
his
mother
almost
tearfully
you
had
much
better
follow
young
griffin
example
your
father
and
i
can
arrange
all
that
by
sending
larkin
into
the
army
and
putting
you
in
his
place
larkin
was
randolph
overseer
and
he
had
not
been
conscripted
by
captain
roach
because
his
employer
had
claimed
exemption
for
him
randolph
supposed
and
so
did
his
wife
that
tom
was
provided
for
as
long
as
the
war
continued
and
as
it
was
necessary
that
they
should
have
an
overseer
they
decided
that
larkin
would
do
as
well
as
anybody
else
and
tom
father
had
entered
into
a
verbal
contract
to
purchase
his
freedom
by
providing
the
hundred
pounds
of
bacon
and
beef
demanded
by
the
confederate
government
they
would
not
have
done
such
a
thing
if
they
had
had
the
least
suspicion
that
tom
position
as
captain
of
the
home
guards
was
likely
to
bring
him
into
contact
with
the
yankees
that
is
the
only
alternative
said
tom
i
must
face
death
or
confinement
in
a
northern
dungeon
or
i
must
send
my
resignation
to
the
governor
at
the
new
capital
but
i
am
afraid
larkin
will
demand
a
larger
bounty
than
father
will
be
willing
to
pay
your
father
will
not
give
him
a
penny
with
my
consent
said
randolph
very
decidedly
he
is
a
hireling
and
his
wishes
will
not
be
consulted
he
will
simply
be
discharged
that
is
all
there
is
of
it
but
he
is
obstinate
and
hard
to
deal
with
and
perhaps
he
will
refuse
to
go
before
his
year
is
out
suggested
captain
tom
in
times
like
these
civil
contracts
are
not
worth
the
paper
they
are
written
on
said
his
mother
in
a
tone
which
seemed
to
imply
that
she
had
already
determined
upon
some
course
of
action
there
are
some
hundred
hands
on
this
plantation
and
if
your
father
should
find
it
impossible
or
inconvenient
to
pay
within
twelve
months
the
eighty
thousand
pounds
of
meat
which
the
confederate
government
will
demand
as
the
price
of
larkin
exemption
then
what
i
think
myself
that
larkin
will
take
to
the
woods
before
he
will
go
into
the
army
i
do
care
where
he
goes
so
long
as
he
gets
out
of
my
way
declared
captain
tom
i
do
know
what
our
neighbors
will
think
of
me
when
they
see
me
in
the
field
with
a
gang
of
niggers
but
i
ca
discover
any
other
way
out
of
the
difficulty
can
you
at
present
i
can
not
but
i
would
much
rather
know
that
you
were
safe
in
the
field
and
within
sound
of
the
than
to
fear
that
you
were
in
danger
of
being
shot
or
captured
perhaps
we
had
best
let
the
subject
rest
where
it
is
until
i
have
had
time
to
ask
your
father
what
he
thinks
about
it
i
will
tell
you
our
decision
and
meanwhile
do
commit
yourself
there
goes
the
bell
it
was
the
call
to
dinner
and
captain
tom
answered
it
although
he
did
not
have
much
appetite
for
the
things
he
found
on
the
table
his
father
had
of
late
got
out
of
the
way
of
asking
his
son
if
he
had
heard
any
news
in
town
but
when
the
latter
remarked
that
he
had
met
and
talked
with
rodney
gray
that
morning
and
that
rodney
and
his
companion
had
been
captured
by
the
enemy
while
on
the
way
home
randolph
took
interest
enough
in
the
matter
to
inquire
into
the
particulars
and
to
ask
tom
if
he
did
think
he
would
run
some
risk
in
taking
conscripts
to
camp
risk
repeated
captain
tom
you
may
well
say
that
roach
thinks
i
will
have
to
fight
my
way
and
so
does
rodney
he
said
in
so
many
words
that
i
would
be
sure
to
lose
my
prisoners
that
the
home
guards
would
be
brushed
out
of
the
way
like
cobwebs
and
if
i
got
through
with
a
whole
skin
he
would
call
me
a
good
one
risk
i
should
think
so
positively
dangerous
well
if
you
do
want
to
go
there
is
one
way
you
can
get
out
of
it
replied
randolph
as
he
folded
his
napkin
and
pushed
his
chair
back
from
the
table
you
can
throw
up
your
commission
i
have
thought
of
resigning
said
tom
and
he
had
half
a
mind
to
broach
the
subject
of
larkin
discharge
then
and
there
but
finally
concluded
that
he
would
leave
it
to
his
mother
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
shall
be
glad
to
see
you
a
civilian
once
more
and
to
know
that
i
shall
never
put
eyes
on
that
sword
and
uniform
again
continued
randolph
the
southern
people
are
all
fools
and
a
year
ago
i
was
one
of
the
most
senseless
of
them
does
that
mean
that
you
have
given
up
the
hope
of
southern
independence
inquired
tom
who
was
not
greatly
surprised
although
he
had
never
heard
his
father
talk
in
this
way
before
it
means
that
we
have
made
beggars
of
ourselves
by
trying
to
break
up
the
government
when
we
had
no
earthly
excuse
for
it
we
were
never
short
of
anything
before
and
now
i
am
put
to
my
stumps
to
find
paper
to
write
on
and
salt
for
my
table
there
will
be
no
bacon
and
hams
for
us
next
winter
unless
i
can
induce
some
of
my
friends
to
do
a
little
trading
in
baton
rouge
for
me
i
dare
not
go
into
the
city
to
do
it
for
myself
for
you
are
captain
of
the
home
guards
i
wish
in
my
soul
that
i
had
had
a
guardian
appointed
over
me
about
the
time
i
was
making
such
an
idiot
of
myself
on
account
of
that
company
randolph
rubbed
some
nigger
twist
between
his
palms
jammed
it
rather
spitefully
into
an
earthen
pipe
with
a
cane
stem
and
went
out
on
the
gallery
to
enjoy
his
smoke
he
was
a
rich
planter
and
it
was
not
so
very
long
ago
that
his
crop
of
cotton
was
worth
a
fortune
to
him
every
year
but
he
could
not
smoke
cigars
now
unless
they
were
given
to
him
some
of
his
neighbors
who
had
not
taken
so
deep
an
interest
in
the
home
guards
rodney
gray
father
for
one
had
passes
that
took
them
in
and
out
of
baton
rouge
as
often
as
they
chose
to
make
use
of
them
and
these
men
had
salt
and
tea
and
coffee
stockings
and
shoes
and
cigars
in
abundance
and
plenty
of
greenback
money
too
as
one
darkey
affirmed
who
chanced
to
catch
a
momentary
glimpse
of
the
inside
of
gray
randolph
made
his
exit
from
the
room
through
one
of
the
low
windows
that
opened
upon
the
veranda
sat
down
long
enough
to
take
a
dozen
or
more
pulls
at
his
pipe
and
then
came
back
to
say
tom
you
want
to
be
kinder
careful
what
you
tell
about
rodney
gray
and
his
folks
for
if
we
work
matters
right
i
am
sure
gray
will
lend
me
a
helping
hand
now
and
then
and
goodness
knows
i
need
it
bad
enough
i
suspicion
that
in
some
way
or
other
he
has
got
on
the
blind
side
of
the
yankees
in
baton
rouge
then
he
ought
to
be
reported
to
our
authorities
said
randolph
spitefully
that
what
i
say
exclaimed
captain
tom
if
he
is
giving
aid
and
comfort
to
the
enemy
he
is
breaking
our
laws
and
i
hold
your
horses
interrupted
his
father
what
is
the
use
of
cutting
off
your
nose
to
spite
your
face
instead
of
giving
aid
and
comfort
to
the
federals
he
is
working
them
so
that
they
are
giving
much
aid
and
comfort
to
him
and
a
few
others
who
are
in
the
ring
with
him
and
is
it
your
desire
to
become
one
of
that
as
you
call
it
demanded
his
wife
pitching
her
voice
in
a
little
higher
key
than
usual
would
you
collogue
with
the
enemies
of
your
country
for
the
sake
of
making
something
out
of
them
am
surprised
to
hear
you
hint
at
such
baseness
and
in
the
presence
of
a
prominent
state
officer
too
hold
your
horses
said
randolph
again
if
i
can
make
something
to
eat
and
wear
by
trading
with
the
yankees
who
seem
to
have
enough
and
to
spare
it
is
to
my
interest
and
yours
to
do
it
is
it
not
and
through
it
all
i
can
still
be
a
good
confederate
ca
i
look
here
he
continued
walking
up
to
the
table
and
sinking
his
voice
almost
to
a
whisper
i
have
bales
of
cotton
concealed
in
the
swamp
and
gray
has
more
than
twice
as
much
and
every
bale
of
that
cotton
is
worth
sixty
cents
a
pound
in
new
york
randolph
straightened
up
and
looked
at
his
wife
and
son
as
much
as
to
say
what
do
you
think
of
that
he
expected
them
to
be
surprised
and
certainly
he
was
not
disappointed
for
a
minute
or
two
they
were
so
amazed
that
they
could
not
speak
i
understand
you
to
say
cents
a
pound
captain
tom
managed
to
ask
at
last
where
did
you
hear
that
ridiculous
story
chimed
in
randolph
i
have
read
the
papers
very
closely
and
i
did
see
anything
of
it
do
you
for
a
moment
imagine
that
our
lying
mr
hold
your
horses
i
know
what
i
am
talking
about
it
is
a
fact
that
our
papers
conceal
everything
that
goes
against
us
or
make
light
of
it
and
of
course
they
would
say
that
cotton
is
bringing
sixty
cents
in
the
north
while
in
the
confederacy
it
is
worth
only
seven
if
our
papers
should
publish
such
reports
as
that
do
you
see
that
the
confederacy
would
get
any
more
cotton
every
planter
who
owns
a
bale
would
make
haste
to
run
it
into
the
swamp
if
i
had
any
cotton
i
would
rather
give
it
to
our
government
for
three
cents
than
to
our
enemies
for
twenty
times
as
much
declared
captain
tom
who
seeing
that
he
did
not
possess
a
pound
of
the
commodity
in
question
could
afford
to
be
very
patriotic
he
looked
at
his
mother
expecting
to
hear
her
say
that
she
would
do
the
same
but
she
gazed
down
at
her
plate
and
said
nothing
sixty
cents
a
pound
reckoning
each
bale
at
pounds
that
would
make
her
husband
concealed
cotton
worth
about
it
could
only
be
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
yankees
without
being
confiscated
but
there
was
the
rub
tom
you
always
were
about
exclaimed
his
father
who
was
so
angry
that
he
spoke
without
thinking
i
would
rather
have
sixty
cents
in
greenback
money
than
four
dollars
in
confederate
scrip
any
day
and
i
do
see
the
use
of
your
talking
in
that
senseless
way
but
your
cotton
is
in
the
swamp
and
how
are
you
going
to
get
it
to
new
york
asked
randolph
and
how
do
you
know
that
you
and
the
darkeys
who
helped
you
put
it
there
are
the
only
ones
who
know
where
it
is
chimed
in
tom
the
lincoln
hirelings
have
been
stealing
cotton
all
the
way
from
cairo
to
vicksburg
and
what
assurance
have
you
that
some
enemy
of
ours
will
not
guide
a
gang
of
from
baton
rouge
to
the
place
where
it
is
hidden
i
have
no
assurance
whatever
and
that
is
one
thing
that
robs
me
of
sleep
at
night
replied
randolph
and
the
nervous
way
in
which
he
puffed
at
his
pipe
and
strode
about
the
room
showed
that
the
thought
made
him
uneasy
every
time
it
came
into
his
mind
of
course
i
stand
a
chance
of
losing
it
but
if
i
can
keep
it
a
few
months
longer
i
know
it
will
be
worth
a
big
sum
of
money
to
good
money
too
one
of
our
neighbors
who
shall
be
nameless
showed
me
a
couple
of
northern
papers
he
brought
from
baton
rouge
last
night
and
both
of
them
contained
a
notice
of
that
sale
of
cotton
in
new
york
there
were
seventy
bales
of
it
and
it
was
confiscated
at
port
royal
some
of
the
ranking
officers
in
the
city
also
told
him
that
there
was
some
talk
of
opening
a
trade
in
cotton
at
all
points
occupied
by
federal
troops
and
that
influential
parties
were
applying
by
the
hundred
for
permits
he
could
have
told
me
more
if
he
had
felt
like
it
but
tom
your
miserable
home
guards
whom
i
wish
i
had
never
heard
of
made
him
shut
his
mouth
i
am
afraid
i
ruined
myself
utterly
by
helping
you
organize
that
company
too
nervous
and
excited
to
say
more
randolph
stepped
through
the
window
to
the
porch
and
tom
left
the
table
and
went
slowly
upstairs
he
could
not
have
told
what
prompted
him
to
do
it
but
when
he
reached
his
room
he
took
off
his
fine
uniform
and
arrayed
himself
in
a
suit
of
citizen
clothes
he
stood
his
elegant
sword
up
in
the
corner
of
his
closet
and
when
it
slipped
down
so
that
he
could
not
close
the
door
he
kicked
it
out
of
the
way
as
he
would
have
done
with
any
other
worthless
piece
of
furniture
for
some
reason
he
seemed
to
have
conceived
a
sudden
and
violent
dislike
to
everything
that
reminded
him
of
the
service
in
which
one
short
year
ago
his
whole
soul
been
wrapped
up
and
when
he
mounted
his
horse
which
a
darkey
had
brought
to
the
door
and
the
animal
began
to
prance
and
go
sideways
as
he
had
been
taught
to
do
captain
tom
was
so
angry
that
he
lashed
him
unmercifully
with
his
whip
and
would
have
kept
him
in
a
dead
run
all
the
way
to
the
enrolling
office
had
it
not
been
for
an
unexpected
and
somewhat
startling
interruption
although
there
were
many
extensive
and
plantations
around
mooreville
there
were
some
unbroken
patches
of
timber
which
stretched
away
into
the
pearl
river
country
and
beyond
this
timberland
was
mostly
low
and
intersected
by
innumerable
little
streams
which
when
the
pearl
was
booming
at
certain
seasons
of
the
year
overflowed
their
banks
and
turned
all
the
productive
bottom
into
an
immense
swamp
it
was
here
that
tom
randolph
lieutenant
plied
his
vocation
though
he
might
have
had
venison
instead
of
pork
if
he
had
not
been
too
lazy
to
hunt
for
it
for
the
bottom
was
a
famous
place
for
game
of
all
kinds
there
were
runaway
negroes
there
too
by
the
score
and
their
numbers
had
increased
wonderfully
since
the
war
broke
out
it
was
while
tom
was
galloping
furiously
past
one
of
these
patches
of
timber
which
was
separated
from
the
road
by
a
narrow
field
of
corn
that
his
attention
was
attracted
by
the
loud
baying
of
a
pack
of
hounds
but
his
mind
was
so
fully
occupied
with
the
punishment
he
was
inflicting
upon
his
unoffending
horse
that
he
did
not
give
much
heed
to
it
until
he
caught
sight
of
a
couple
of
men
riding
swiftly
through
the
corn
a
little
in
advance
of
him
when
they
reached
the
fence
that
ran
between
the
field
and
the
road
one
of
them
threw
off
the
top
rails
so
that
they
could
jump
their
horses
over
it
while
the
other
raised
his
hand
as
a
signal
for
tom
to
stop
then
he
saw
that
the
men
were
strangers
to
him
that
they
wore
gray
uniforms
were
armed
with
carbines
and
sabres
instead
of
squirrel
rifles
and
shot
guns
and
wore
plumes
in
their
slouch
hats
instead
of
rooster
feathers
they
were
veterans
beyond
a
doubt
but
where
did
they
come
from
and
what
were
they
doing
in
that
country
which
was
supposed
to
be
guarded
by
an
efficient
company
of
home
guards
their
presence
angered
captain
tom
and
he
wished
he
had
the
authority
to
order
them
back
where
they
belonged
without
asking
any
questions
but
they
greeted
him
very
civilly
said
the
foremost
as
he
leaped
his
horse
over
the
ditch
and
came
into
the
road
where
tom
was
waiting
for
him
then
he
made
a
military
salute
which
was
promptly
and
gracefully
returned
ah
i
thought
you
were
one
of
us
from
the
start
continued
the
veteran
what
regiment
i
do
not
belong
to
any
regiment
admitted
tom
i
am
commander
of
a
partisan
company
and
hold
a
commission
from
the
governor
seen
any
service
was
the
soldier
next
question
more
than
i
want
to
see
again
replied
tom
who
had
not
yet
been
cured
of
his
propensity
to
boast
as
often
as
the
chance
was
presented
the
enemy
gunboats
have
kept
me
pretty
busy
since
they
came
up
from
new
orleans
well
if
you
got
courage
enough
to
fight
gunboats
you
got
more
than
i
have
said
the
veteran
honestly
how
high
up
are
you
i
am
a
captain
i
beg
your
pardon
sah
i
have
been
a
little
too
fast
i
am
only
a
second
lieutenant
and
my
comrade
is
a
first
duty
sergeant
and
then
the
lieutenant
and
his
sergeant
both
raised
their
caps
they
had
evidently
served
under
some
officer
who
exacted
all
the
honors
due
him
of
course
they
took
the
right
course
to
gain
tom
good
will
and
bring
them
an
invitation
to
supper
but
they
did
not
do
it
intentionally
having
served
at
the
front
ever
since
they
enlisted
and
until
they
were
transferred
to
the
invalid
corps
on
account
of
wounds
received
in
battle
they
had
never
seen
any
home
guards
and
did
not
know
the
estimation
in
which
that
useless
organization
was
held
by
the
people
who
knew
the
most
about
them
they
had
heard
of
the
exploits
of
john
mosby
who
commanded
a
body
of
men
that
were
farmers
during
the
daytime
and
robbers
and
at
night
and
who
had
kept
certain
portions
of
virginia
in
a
turmoil
even
before
he
was
thought
to
be
worthy
of
a
commission
in
the
confederate
army
and
they
supposed
that
every
company
of
partisans
was
just
like
his
consequently
they
were
ready
to
treat
tom
randolph
with
the
greatest
respect
the
latter
drew
himself
up
very
stiffly
assumed
a
soldier
position
in
the
saddle
copying
rodney
gray
as
nearly
as
he
could
and
said
with
the
dignity
befitting
his
rank
i
assure
you
that
no
apologies
are
necessary
i
am
always
glad
to
shake
a
loyal
confederate
by
the
hand
and
he
proved
it
by
extending
to
each
of
the
veterans
a
palm
that
was
as
limp
as
a
piece
of
wet
rope
now
may
i
ask
where
you
belong
and
what
business
brought
you
to
this
part
of
the
country
certainly
sah
we
used
to
belong
to
jackson
brigade
and
division
but
were
invalided
on
account
of
injuries
received
in
action
and
are
now
serving
as
guards
at
a
conscript
camp
the
luck
we
are
on
the
trail
of
four
escaped
yankees
who
are
making
tracks
for
baton
rouge
did
you
hear
our
dogs
giving
tongue
just
now
i
noticed
it
but
supposed
the
hounds
were
running
something
on
their
own
hook
i
noticed
too
that
they
yelped
as
though
they
were
baffled
and
so
they
are
we
have
followed
the
trail
for
forty
miles
through
swamp
and
briers
and
cane
and
now
we
have
lost
it
completely
we
ought
to
have
captured
and
hung
the
villains
long
ago
but
everywhere
along
their
line
of
flight
they
have
been
assisted
by
the
negroes
we
found
abundant
proof
of
it
well
that
bangs
me
exclaimed
tom
who
like
many
others
of
his
class
labored
under
the
delusion
that
the
slaves
did
not
know
who
their
friends
were
why
did
you
not
shoot
the
negroes
for
the
very
good
reason
sah
that
we
could
not
place
the
blame
upon
any
particular
ones
we
found
where
the
yanks
had
been
fed
and
once
came
so
close
upon
them
that
we
captured
some
quilts
which
the
darkeys
had
loaned
them
for
beds
but
among
the
hundred
and
fifty
negroes
on
that
plantation
we
could
not
find
the
one
who
owned
the
quilts
do
you
know
of
any
union
men
or
blacks
around
here
who
would
be
likely
to
give
them
food
and
shelter
or
aid
them
in
reaching
baton
rouge
if
that
question
had
been
asked
him
the
day
before
captain
randolph
could
have
mentioned
the
names
of
a
dozen
white
men
who
were
mean
and
disloyal
enough
to
give
food
and
shelter
to
anybody
who
wore
a
blue
uniform
but
now
he
could
not
think
of
a
single
one
among
others
he
would
have
given
the
names
of
some
returned
soldiers
who
had
spread
dissatisfaction
in
the
ranks
of
his
company
by
deriding
tom
ability
as
a
commander
and
laughing
at
the
story
of
his
battles
with
the
and
he
would
have
asked
the
lieutenant
what
he
thought
of
fellows
like
rodney
gray
and
dick
graham
who
did
not
hesitate
to
declare
that
they
were
sick
of
the
army
and
did
not
intend
to
go
back
if
they
could
help
it
he
would
have
told
too
of
the
trading
that
was
continually
going
on
between
the
yankee
invaders
and
confederates
who
lived
in
baton
rouge
and
mooreville
but
somehow
he
did
not
speak
of
any
of
these
things
the
knowledge
that
mooreville
might
at
any
moment
be
occupied
by
federal
cavalry
frightened
him
and
the
plain
words
his
father
spoke
at
the
dinner
table
opened
his
eyes
to
the
fact
that
silence
was
sometimes
good
policy
so
he
made
answer
there
are
several
people
about
here
who
are
suspected
of
being
union
but
i
ca
say
whether
they
are
or
not
i
drove
some
out
of
the
settlement
months
ago
and
they
have
never
returned
that
was
perfectly
right
sah
said
the
lieutenant
but
i
should
think
you
would
be
afraid
to
stay
here
what
will
you
do
when
the
yanks
come
swarming
into
town
and
some
mean
sneak
tells
them
that
you
have
been
persecuting
union
men
you
will
have
to
take
to
the
brush
but
do
you
think
the
enemy
is
in
sufficient
force
to
ride
over
us
like
that
inquired
tom
anxiously
he
had
often
asked
himself
this
very
question
and
tried
to
find
comfort
in
the
hope
that
the
yankees
would
never
find
their
way
to
mooreville
oh
it
does
require
much
force
to
take
full
possession
of
a
little
town
like
this
replied
the
veteran
i
could
do
it
with
a
dozen
men
we
have
seen
of
their
cavalry
since
we
have
been
on
this
hunt
you
have
seen
them
ejaculated
tom
yes
we
ran
into
some
of
them
and
had
to
skirmish
our
way
out
we
have
seen
a
squad
on
every
road
except
this
and
how
those
four
escaped
prisoners
we
are
after
missed
seeing
them
beats
me
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
there
are
yankees
between
here
and
camp
pinckney
exclaimed
tom
who
did
not
like
to
hear
rodney
story
and
dick
confirmed
in
this
positive
way
i
should
think
you
would
have
turned
back
when
you
found
your
way
blocked
since
you
are
an
old
soldier
sah
and
have
snuffed
yankee
powder
i
know
that
you
are
joking
our
way
was
blocked
and
we
had
no
orders
to
turn
back
we
were
commanded
to
capture
those
four
men
and
bring
them
to
camp
pinckney
without
the
loss
of
an
hour
and
so
we
kept
right
on
as
though
there
had
been
a
yank
within
miles
of
us
captain
randolph
gazed
admiringly
at
the
veteran
who
did
not
talk
or
act
as
though
he
had
done
more
than
any
other
soldier
would
have
done
under
the
circumstances
chapter
ix
uncle
sam
lost
boys
i
wish
i
had
some
of
your
courage
said
tom
at
length
i
may
need
it
for
i
am
liable
any
day
to
be
ordered
to
camp
pinckney
with
a
squad
of
conscripts
whistled
the
lieutenant
he
looked
at
the
sergeant
the
sergeant
looked
at
him
and
then
they
both
looked
at
captain
tom
with
an
expression
on
their
faces
that
the
latter
could
not
understand
well
if
this
is
the
sort
of
work
you
partisans
have
to
do
i
am
glad
i
am
not
a
partisan
continued
the
lieutenant
i
rather
go
through
bull
run
and
take
my
chances
than
attempt
to
travel
the
sixty
miles
between
here
and
camp
with
a
squad
of
conscripts
you
will
have
to
take
to
the
woods
of
course
and
that
will
be
the
time
your
conscripts
will
give
you
the
slip
if
you
start
with
a
hundred
and
get
through
with
ten
you
will
be
doing
well
there
are
people
here
who
think
i
not
get
through
at
all
said
tom
they
say
that
i
and
my
men
will
be
captured
or
killed
course
answered
the
lieutenant
who
had
never
once
thought
of
that
contingency
it
to
be
expected
that
you
will
take
your
chances
on
that
it
is
what
we
all
have
to
do
when
we
meet
the
enemy
have
you
found
them
a
tolerably
brave
lot
inquired
captain
tom
who
wanted
much
to
meet
some
veteran
who
would
assure
him
that
the
yankees
were
all
cowards
and
did
not
know
how
to
fight
as
brave
as
they
make
said
the
lieutenant
earnestly
and
dead
shots
into
the
bargain
we
have
bitten
off
a
good
deal
more
than
we
can
chew
in
ten
years
now
you
remember
what
i
tell
you
of
course
captain
i
would
say
that
in
the
presence
of
a
civilian
but
one
old
soldier
knows
how
to
take
another
now
do
you
think
sah
that
you
partisans
could
lend
us
a
hand
in
capturing
these
yankees
why
certainly
and
i
will
warn
my
company
out
at
once
replied
tom
readily
where
will
i
find
you
at
the
end
of
a
couple
of
hours
i
want
you
and
the
sergeant
to
take
supper
and
lodgings
at
my
mother
house
much
obliged
to
you
sah
but
we
could
think
of
it
said
the
lieutenant
colonel
the
regular
who
commands
the
take
us
to
task
for
wasting
time
if
he
should
hear
of
it
and
besides
we
do
want
to
run
the
risk
of
being
gobbled
gobbled
repeated
captain
tom
for
that
was
a
word
that
had
not
yet
reached
his
part
of
the
confederacy
captured
you
know
who
going
to
capture
you
at
our
house
exclaimed
tom
who
could
feel
himself
turning
white
the
yankee
scouts
might
if
they
should
happen
to
ride
into
town
and
any
enemy
of
yours
could
tell
them
where
to
find
us
and
these
escaped
prisoners
might
do
it
captain
randolph
was
utterly
confounded
his
idea
of
an
escaped
prisoner
was
a
man
running
frantically
for
his
life
and
too
badly
frightened
to
look
behind
him
but
the
lieutenant
words
made
it
plain
to
him
that
the
four
who
were
somewhere
in
the
vicinity
of
mooreville
were
not
that
sort
he
became
really
alarmed
when
the
soldier
went
on
to
explain
the
situation
you
see
they
were
run
down
and
gobbled
up
three
days
ago
by
a
large
squad
of
our
cavalry
who
started
them
for
camp
under
guard
of
four
good
men
one
for
each
prisoner
said
he
but
before
they
had
been
away
from
us
half
an
hour
what
do
those
yankees
do
but
rise
up
and
kill
their
guards
take
their
weapons
and
ammunition
hitch
their
horses
in
the
woods
so
that
they
could
not
go
on
and
alarm
the
camp
and
dig
out
through
the
swamp
for
the
mississippi
river
and
those
armed
and
desperate
prisoners
are
supposed
to
be
somewhere
in
the
settlement
at
this
moment
said
tom
with
a
shudder
that
is
what
we
think
for
the
dogs
tracked
them
within
a
mile
of
this
cornfield
i
hope
you
will
hang
them
the
minute
you
get
your
hands
on
them
said
tom
in
a
trembling
voice
there
are
fourteen
men
in
my
squad
and
that
is
what
they
allow
to
do
replied
the
lieutenant
but
then
they
wo
for
that
would
bring
them
into
trouble
with
colonel
parker
if
a
captured
man
sees
a
chance
to
escape
he
is
at
liberty
to
improve
it
and
to
hurt
anything
or
anybody
that
gets
in
his
way
and
in
doing
it
he
runs
the
risk
of
getting
hurt
himself
the
first
we
heard
of
it
said
the
sergeant
speaking
for
the
first
time
was
when
six
of
our
men
came
into
camp
on
foot
and
reported
that
they
had
been
disarmed
and
dismounted
by
four
yankees
who
had
paroled
and
turned
them
loose
that
was
about
as
impudent
a
thing
as
i
ever
heard
of
and
it
shows
what
a
daring
lot
those
escaped
yanks
are
said
the
lieutenant
and
instead
of
getting
angry
when
he
thought
of
it
he
surprised
tom
by
laughing
heartily
as
though
he
looked
upon
it
as
the
best
kind
of
a
joke
a
private
has
no
right
to
parole
anybody
but
all
the
same
those
yanks
wrote
out
the
papers
in
due
form
and
told
our
boys
that
they
could
either
sign
them
or
stay
there
in
the
swamp
till
a
party
came
out
from
camp
to
bury
them
and
our
boys
thought
they
had
better
sign
i
did
suppose
that
escaped
prisoners
ever
acted
that
way
said
captain
tom
after
a
few
minutes
of
surprised
silence
wo
they
have
something
to
talk
about
when
they
get
among
their
friends
said
the
lieutenant
with
another
laugh
they
are
brave
soldiers
and
i
bet
you
they
are
good
fellows
and
when
the
war
is
over
i
do
care
which
side
whips
i
would
like
to
meet
them
and
talk
over
the
events
of
the
last
few
days
we
have
a
good
laugh
over
them
i
do
think
it
is
any
laughing
matter
to
kill
four
men
as
those
yanks
killed
their
guards
replied
tom
who
could
not
understand
how
men
fighting
under
opposing
flags
could
have
the
least
particle
of
respect
or
kindly
feeling
for
one
another
oh
that
war
you
know
said
the
lieutenant
lightly
but
you
will
see
now
why
the
sergeant
and
i
must
decline
your
kind
invitation
to
take
supper
and
sleep
at
your
house
we
do
want
to
put
ourselves
in
a
position
to
be
surrounded
and
captured
for
we
are
pretty
close
to
baton
rouge
and
those
yanks
might
decide
to
take
us
along
instead
of
parolling
us
if
we
camp
in
the
woods
with
our
dogs
around
us
know
that
we
are
safe
now
we
shall
have
to
bid
you
captain
you
will
get
your
company
together
and
do
what
you
can
to
help
us
look
out
that
they
do
get
the
first
shot
at
you
sah
suggested
the
sergeant
and
if
you
are
lucky
enough
to
catch
them
may
i
depend
on
you
to
send
them
to
camp
under
guard
added
the
lieutenant
it
might
be
to
your
interest
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
our
colonel
captain
randolph
shook
hands
with
the
two
veterans
and
promised
to
do
all
a
loyal
soldier
could
do
to
head
the
fugitives
off
from
baton
rouge
and
send
them
back
to
camp
pinckney
but
there
was
not
so
much
heart
in
his
promise
as
there
was
in
the
one
he
made
before
he
learned
that
the
yankees
were
armed
and
daring
in
order
to
keep
up
appearances
however
he
put
his
horse
into
a
lope
as
soon
as
the
was
over
and
made
the
best
of
his
way
to
the
enrolling
office
he
found
a
few
home
guards
loafing
there
but
not
half
as
many
as
he
would
have
found
two
days
before
these
valiant
men
had
heard
that
they
might
be
ordered
off
with
a
squad
of
conscripts
any
time
and
they
did
not
care
to
go
while
the
union
cavalry
were
riding
about
through
the
country
so
the
most
of
them
stayed
at
home
holding
themselves
in
readiness
to
take
to
their
heels
if
they
saw
a
horseman
approaching
and
had
any
reason
to
believe
that
he
had
been
sent
by
captain
roach
to
warn
them
to
report
for
duty
the
captain
was
at
his
desk
and
for
some
reason
or
other
seemed
to
be
in
the
best
of
spirits
you
ought
to
have
dropped
in
about
half
an
hour
ago
said
he
as
tom
walked
into
the
office
after
hitching
his
horse
at
the
rack
in
front
of
the
door
i
have
had
a
very
pleasant
visit
from
one
of
your
old
friends
who
has
just
returned
from
bragg
army
captain
randolph
was
so
surprised
that
he
forgot
all
about
the
daring
yankees
who
were
running
wild
in
the
woods
in
close
proximity
to
mooreville
he
left
home
for
the
express
purpose
of
warning
the
enrolling
officer
against
rodney
gray
and
his
chum
dick
graham
but
something
in
the
captain
manner
told
him
that
his
efforts
in
that
direction
would
not
meet
with
much
success
for
the
returned
soldiers
had
had
the
first
chance
at
the
captain
and
they
were
both
winning
fellows
if
you
are
speaking
of
rodney
began
tom
in
angry
tones
so
you
have
seen
him
have
you
exclaimed
the
enrolling
officer
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
breaking
out
into
a
peal
of
laughter
well
he
a
good
one
is
he
if
you
are
speaking
of
him
sputtered
tom
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
he
is
no
friend
of
mine
i
have
told
you
so
more
times
than
i
can
remember
i
know
you
have
and
i
confess
that
i
treated
him
and
his
chum
rather
coldly
when
they
came
into
the
office
and
said
they
wanted
to
set
themselves
square
with
me
by
showing
that
they
were
honorably
discharged
confederate
soldiers
answered
the
captain
but
they
did
not
seem
to
care
a
snap
for
me
or
for
my
opinion
of
them
that
just
like
rodney
impudence
exclaimed
tom
well
you
see
he
has
a
sort
of
contempt
for
me
because
i
am
not
a
veteran
he
knows
more
in
five
minutes
than
i
do
in
a
month
and
he
is
not
ignorant
of
the
fact
he
and
his
chum
sat
down
without
waiting
to
be
asked
talked
as
though
they
had
known
me
always
and
i
laughed
till
i
cried
over
the
stories
they
told
of
army
life
i
hope
to
hear
more
of
those
stories
when
i
go
up
to
gray
to
dinner
on
thursday
if
the
enrolling
officer
had
aimed
a
blow
at
him
with
the
ebony
ruler
that
lay
on
his
desk
tom
randolph
would
not
have
been
more
dumfounded
he
leaned
heavily
upon
the
back
of
a
chair
for
a
moment
or
two
and
then
dropped
almost
helplessly
into
it
to
dinner
on
thursday
he
repeated
faintly
you
must
go
there
what
the
reason
i
must
demanded
captain
roach
surprised
in
his
turn
good
dinners
are
not
so
plenty
these
times
that
i
can
afford
to
throw
them
over
my
shoulder
it
is
that
replied
tom
it
the
sentiments
of
the
people
who
invited
you
that
i
object
to
when
you
go
into
old
man
gray
house
you
will
go
plump
into
a
nest
of
traitors
no
i
reckon
not
a
man
who
volunteers
and
does
a
soldier
duty
for
fifteen
long
months
and
who
shows
me
an
honorable
discharge
well
be
called
a
traitor
he
stayed
in
the
army
after
he
got
there
because
he
had
to
and
did
a
soldier
duty
for
the
very
good
reason
that
he
could
help
himself
said
captain
tom
spitefully
but
see
how
he
talks
since
he
came
back
he
says
he
will
not
go
into
the
army
again
and
declares
that
the
yanks
who
captured
him
while
he
was
on
the
way
home
were
gentlemen
well
what
would
you
think
if
you
had
been
in
his
place
what
was
there
to
hinder
those
yanks
from
taking
him
and
graham
to
baton
rouge
and
turning
them
over
to
the
provost
marshal
they
were
in
uniform
when
they
were
captured
i
see
you
are
on
the
side
of
those
traitors
said
tom
rising
to
his
feet
and
pounding
lightly
upon
the
captain
desk
with
his
clenched
hand
and
i
have
this
much
to
say
to
you
if
you
go
to
gray
you
will
no
longer
be
welcome
at
our
house
i
shall
be
sorry
for
that
of
course
but
i
do
suppose
i
can
help
it
gray
and
his
chum
know
all
about
soldiering
and
as
i
may
have
to
go
into
the
army
myself
some
day
i
want
to
learn
all
i
can
from
them
i
think
you
would
be
wise
to
do
the
same
and
while
you
have
been
having
a
good
time
with
my
enemies
i
have
been
working
for
the
cause
which
you
made
oath
to
support
but
seem
to
have
deserted
continued
tom
impressively
i
have
been
making
arrangements
to
capture
some
of
the
very
men
whom
rodney
gray
and
dick
graham
promised
to
assist
if
they
found
them
in
trouble
i
want
all
you
fellows
here
he
turned
about
and
addressed
himself
to
the
home
guards
who
had
come
into
the
office
to
hear
what
passed
between
their
captain
and
the
enrolling
officer
to
mount
your
horses
at
once
and
go
in
pursuit
of
four
escaped
prisoners
who
are
hiding
in
the
woods
somewhere
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
as
you
go
warn
every
other
member
of
the
company
you
see
to
turn
out
and
join
in
the
chase
why
captain
what
do
you
mean
cried
the
enrolling
officer
becoming
excited
at
once
without
paying
the
least
attention
to
him
or
his
question
captain
tom
proceeded
to
give
his
men
a
short
and
very
incomplete
account
of
the
interview
he
had
held
with
the
two
veterans
while
he
was
on
his
way
to
town
we
say
the
account
was
incomplete
because
tom
did
not
tell
his
men
that
the
fugitives
had
armed
themselves
when
they
escaped
from
their
guards
and
had
been
carrying
things
with
a
high
hand
ever
since
he
was
afraid
he
could
not
raise
much
of
a
squad
to
aid
in
the
pursuit
if
he
told
that
so
all
he
said
was
that
the
four
yankees
were
striking
for
baton
rouge
that
fourteen
confederate
veterans
had
been
following
them
with
hounds
for
three
days
past
and
that
if
they
the
home
guards
would
turn
out
in
a
body
and
capture
the
prisoners
from
under
the
noses
of
the
confederates
it
might
be
a
feather
in
their
hats
the
home
guards
thought
so
too
and
hardly
waiting
for
tom
to
get
through
with
what
he
had
to
tell
them
they
made
a
rush
through
the
door
toward
the
rack
at
which
their
horses
were
hitched
i
am
glad
to
see
you
so
prompt
to
obey
orders
shouted
captain
tom
following
them
to
the
sidewalk
and
waving
his
hand
to
them
as
they
rode
off
one
after
the
other
we
show
the
authorities
that
there
are
some
loyal
people
around
here
yet
i
be
with
you
as
soon
as
i
can
ride
home
and
get
my
uniform
and
weapons
but
you
need
wait
divide
yourselves
into
squads
of
six
or
eight
and
search
every
nook
and
corner
of
the
woods
you
can
get
into
between
this
time
and
dark
and
do
forget
and
nigger
cabins
nor
the
cellars
and
lofts
of
union
men
i
think
it
strange
that
you
did
not
bring
those
confederate
officers
straight
to
my
office
said
the
conscript
captain
when
the
last
home
guard
had
ridden
away
out
of
sight
since
you
have
deserted
loyal
people
for
the
society
of
those
who
say
that
they
will
not
do
anything
more
for
the
cause
they
pretend
to
believe
in
i
am
sorry
myself
that
i
did
not
bring
them
here
answered
tom
but
i
did
not
once
think
of
it
i
am
glad
they
did
not
accept
my
invitation
to
supper
for
i
should
have
felt
obliged
to
ask
you
to
join
them
where
are
you
going
he
added
when
captain
roach
began
bundling
his
papers
into
his
desk
and
locking
the
drawers
i
am
going
to
help
capture
those
four
yankees
said
he
they
are
confederate
prisoners
and
i
am
a
confederate
officer
tom
did
not
wait
to
see
him
off
but
mounted
his
horse
and
set
out
for
home
at
top
speed
as
if
he
were
impatient
to
arm
himself
and
join
his
men
in
the
pursuit
but
he
went
long
distances
out
of
his
way
to
summon
members
of
his
company
whom
he
knew
he
would
not
find
at
home
so
that
it
was
after
three
when
he
galloped
through
his
father
gate
and
drew
rein
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
he
had
had
ample
time
to
think
over
the
situation
and
make
up
his
mind
what
he
would
do
my
dear
boy
exclaimed
randolph
when
tom
had
hurriedly
explained
matters
to
her
you
must
not
risk
your
life
and
liberty
by
going
in
pursuit
of
those
escaped
prisoners
i
never
consent
to
it
never
in
this
world
then
show
me
please
how
i
can
get
out
of
it
answered
captain
tom
gently
disengaging
himself
from
his
mother
clinging
hands
and
starting
up
the
stairs
toward
his
room
some
of
my
men
are
in
the
woods
by
this
time
and
if
that
lieutenant
should
happen
to
run
against
them
his
first
question
would
be
your
captain
he
ought
to
be
here
conducting
the
pursuit
in
person
really
i
must
show
up
mother
for
i
want
those
veterans
to
tell
colonel
parker
when
they
go
back
to
camp
that
i
did
all
i
could
to
aid
them
in
capturing
the
yanks
then
you
are
sure
they
will
be
they
will
not
be
permitted
to
roam
at
liberty
during
the
night
said
randolph
who
had
never
before
exhibited
so
much
nervousness
and
anxiety
as
she
did
at
that
moment
i
could
sleep
if
i
knew
they
were
at
large
no
i
am
not
sure
of
it
for
they
have
proved
themselves
to
be
both
daring
and
cunning
just
think
what
they
have
done
they
have
killed
their
guards
captured
and
paroled
half
a
dozen
soldiers
and
kept
out
of
reach
of
the
hounds
for
three
days
and
such
men
are
not
going
to
be
taken
easily
i
bet
you
replied
tom
from
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
then
he
went
into
his
room
to
don
his
uniform
and
buckle
on
his
sword
and
revolver
a
few
minutes
later
he
came
out
to
ask
his
mother
what
she
thought
of
captain
roach
way
of
doing
business
i
wonder
if
he
could
be
reported
and
hauled
over
the
coals
for
associating
with
those
grays
said
tom
if
the
captain
is
we
have
no
way
of
judging
of
his
feelings
except
by
his
certainly
think
his
superior
officers
ought
to
know
it
said
randolph
but
my
i
know
what
you
want
to
say
interrupted
captain
tom
you
mean
that
if
i
report
him
for
any
of
his
shortcomings
he
will
conscript
me
then
he
had
better
do
it
at
once
for
if
he
waits
a
week
it
will
be
too
late
tom
are
you
going
to
resign
your
commission
i
am
going
to
take
larkin
place
as
overseer
of
this
plantation
replied
tom
very
decidedly
i
thought
it
would
be
a
big
at
first
but
since
i
have
thought
the
matter
over
i
have
made
up
my
mind
that
it
will
be
a
change
for
the
better
i
ca
be
forced
into
the
army
being
a
civilian
i
may
be
able
to
obtain
some
salt
coffee
and
things
from
the
yanks
and
if
father
ever
has
a
chance
to
sell
that
cotton
i
shall
be
at
hand
to
help
him
run
it
up
out
of
the
swamp
captain
tom
fully
expected
that
his
mother
would
strongly
object
to
these
plans
and
he
even
thought
she
might
denounce
him
as
a
traitor
to
the
south
and
its
flag
but
somewhat
to
his
surprise
she
did
nothing
of
the
kind
she
too
had
had
leisure
to
think
the
matter
over
and
much
against
her
will
had
been
obliged
to
confess
to
herself
that
it
did
pay
to
be
too
good
a
rebel
while
the
federals
held
undisputed
possession
of
baton
rouge
and
cavalry
were
scouting
about
through
the
country
she
even
wished
that
tom
would
hide
his
uniform
his
military
saddle
and
bridle
and
his
sword
where
nobody
would
ever
see
them
again
that
is
what
i
have
decided
to
do
continued
captain
tom
as
he
slipped
his
into
its
holster
and
came
down
the
stairs
and
i
mean
to
attend
to
it
as
soon
as
i
see
those
four
yanks
captured
perhaps
it
would
be
as
well
answered
his
mother
delays
are
sometimes
dangerous
but
i
do
see
how
i
can
give
my
consent
to
let
you
go
on
this
expedition
do
worry
about
me
i
am
bound
to
come
back
all
right
and
never
have
to
go
on
another
and
when
that
traitor
roach
gets
ready
to
send
off
his
conscripts
he
can
tell
somebody
besides
me
to
take
them
will
you
recommend
anyone
to
the
governor
to
take
your
place
not
much
i
do
care
whether
or
not
anybody
gets
it
so
long
as
lambert
is
left
out
in
the
cold
with
a
fair
chance
of
being
sent
to
camp
pinckney
mother
i
must
be
off
or
some
person
in
the
settlement
will
accuse
me
of
shirking
my
duty
the
was
a
tearful
one
on
randolph
part
but
captain
tom
could
not
have
been
more
unconcerned
if
he
had
been
going
to
mooreville
to
buy
groceries
he
thought
he
knew
a
way
to
keep
up
his
reputation
as
a
loyal
southerner
and
steer
clear
of
the
dreaded
yankees
at
the
same
time
there
one
thing
about
it
soliloquized
tom
as
he
galloped
out
of
the
gate
waving
a
last
farewell
to
his
mother
as
he
went
our
folks
are
not
as
fierce
for
secession
as
they
used
to
be
and
i
am
mighty
glad
to
know
it
we
getting
so
we
live
awful
hard
our
table
is
a
sight
to
behold
with
nothing
on
it
but
corn
pone
bacon
sweet
potato
coffee
and
buttermilk
from
one
week
end
to
another
and
i
am
getting
tired
of
such
grub
and
where
am
i
going
to
raise
dollars
in
confederate
money
to
pay
for
a
pair
of
boots
when
these
wear
out
there
plenty
of
gold
in
the
house
and
i
could
use
it
to
good
advantage
if
i
could
only
get
into
baton
rouge
and
obtain
a
permit
from
the
provost
marshal
to
trade
there
i
bet
you
that
rodney
gray
and
that
chum
of
his
will
be
rigged
out
from
head
to
foot
the
next
time
i
see
them
and
they
will
buy
their
things
inside
the
yankee
lines
too
now
i
tell
you
what
a
fact
i
just
as
much
right
to
use
the
yankees
as
they
have
when
captain
tom
reached
this
point
in
his
meditations
he
drew
rein
in
front
of
a
pair
of
bars
giving
entrance
into
a
lane
that
ran
through
his
father
plantation
in
the
direction
of
the
river
the
house
was
concealed
from
his
view
by
an
abrupt
bend
in
the
road
and
a
hasty
glance
on
each
side
showed
him
that
there
was
no
one
in
sight
so
he
bent
down
from
his
saddle
opened
the
bars
and
rode
into
the
lane
it
is
true
that
the
escaped
prisoners
and
the
soldiers
and
hounds
that
were
pursuing
them
were
not
on
that
side
of
the
road
but
two
miles
away
in
the
opposite
direction
but
captain
tom
did
not
stop
to
think
of
that
he
knew
where
he
was
going
and
made
all
haste
to
get
there
as
soon
as
he
had
put
up
the
bars
there
are
not
half
a
dozen
citizens
in
the
neighborhood
who
will
lend
a
hand
in
catching
those
prisoners
and
the
last
one
of
the
home
guards
will
fall
out
and
strike
for
a
place
of
safety
the
minute
they
find
out
that
the
yanks
are
armed
thought
tom
as
he
rode
swiftly
along
the
lane
turning
about
in
his
saddle
now
and
then
to
make
sure
that
no
one
was
observing
his
movements
and
that
being
the
case
why
should
i
risk
my
life
in
trying
to
capture
them
say
by
gracious
as
this
exclamation
fell
from
captain
tom
lips
he
pulled
up
his
horse
with
a
jerk
and
looked
first
at
the
road
and
then
at
the
cluster
of
trees
that
shut
the
house
off
from
his
sight
he
spent
a
minute
or
two
in
this
way
and
then
rode
on
again
that
a
splendid
idea
but
my
wit
always
comes
too
late
to
be
of
any
use
to
me
said
he
angrily
and
he
avenged
himself
on
his
slow
wit
by
hitting
his
spirited
horse
such
a
stinging
cut
with
his
whip
that
the
animal
came
very
near
flying
the
road
and
going
off
into
the
ditch
instead
of
this
gray
uniform
which
will
send
me
to
a
northern
prison
if
the
yankees
ever
catch
me
with
it
on
why
did
i
keep
on
my
citizen
clothes
then
i
need
have
had
the
least
fear
of
meeting
the
prisoners
i
could
have
fed
and
sheltered
them
and
guided
them
to
the
city
in
the
morning
and
in
return
for
my
services
i
could
have
asked
the
provost
marshal
to
give
me
a
permit
to
buy
some
things
in
the
stores
the
luck
captain
randolph
hit
his
horse
another
merciless
blow
with
the
whip
and
this
time
the
animal
sudden
spring
had
a
most
astounding
result
he
jumped
sideways
clear
over
the
ditch
that
ran
by
the
side
of
the
road
and
when
he
landed
on
the
opposite
bank
he
stopped
so
quickly
that
his
rider
was
thrown
headlong
from
his
saddle
bringing
up
among
the
cotton
stalks
ten
feet
farther
on
he
was
not
in
the
least
injured
or
even
jarred
by
his
fall
but
he
was
tolerably
angry
to
find
himself
so
easily
unhorsed
he
raised
himself
on
his
elbow
but
before
he
could
make
another
move
or
give
utterance
to
his
feelings
a
voice
near
at
hand
said
pleasantly
glad
to
see
you
john
but
did
expect
to
be
introduced
in
such
a
promiscuous
manner
you
know
do
stand
on
ceremony
but
come
right
in
the
is
always
out
this
incident
happened
almost
in
the
edge
of
the
little
grove
of
evergreens
toward
which
captain
tom
had
been
directing
his
course
ever
since
he
passed
through
the
bars
it
was
his
intention
to
conceal
himself
and
his
horse
among
the
evergreens
and
remain
there
in
safety
until
dark
while
the
rest
of
the
home
guards
and
the
citizens
if
any
there
were
who
had
a
fancy
to
join
captain
roach
in
such
perilous
business
searched
the
woods
for
the
escaped
prisoners
tom
randolph
first
feeling
was
one
of
the
most
intense
surprise
without
a
particle
of
fear
or
anxiety
in
it
but
when
he
rolled
over
on
his
side
to
bring
his
face
toward
the
grove
he
was
almost
paralyzed
with
terror
to
see
three
ragged
fellows
in
nondescript
uniforms
advancing
swiftly
upon
him
while
a
fourth
covered
his
head
with
a
cocked
carbine
from
the
edge
of
the
evergreens
one
of
the
three
secured
his
horse
which
had
not
moved
an
inch
since
he
rid
himself
of
his
inhuman
rider
a
second
swung
the
black
muzzle
of
a
musket
in
unpleasant
proximity
to
his
face
and
the
third
knelt
by
his
side
and
took
possession
of
his
sword
and
revolver
was
yer
looking
fur
we
uns
johnny
boy
chuckled
the
one
who
held
the
musket
if
yer
was
hyar
we
is
mighty
glad
to
see
yer
and
dat
a
fac
come
along
now
and
we
uns
will
cut
a
watermillyun
are
you
gasped
tom
whose
terror
was
greatly
increased
by
the
soldier
grim
humor
illustration
tom
randolph
captured
by
the
escaped
prisoners
well
johnny
we
so
ragged
and
dirty
just
now
that
we
do
rightly
know
who
we
are
except
that
we
are
some
of
uncle
sam
lost
boys
replied
the
one
who
had
captured
the
sword
and
revolver
i
expect
down
to
baton
rouge
now
waiting
for
us
and
so
we
best
be
toddling
along
take
that
horse
into
the
grove
out
of
sight
ben
come
on
johnny
have
you
heard
hounds
giving
tongue
in
the
woods
anywhere
about
here
inquired
the
one
who
had
first
spoken
tom
was
so
nearly
overcome
with
fear
that
he
could
not
answer
he
hardly
knew
when
two
of
uncle
sam
lost
boys
took
him
by
the
arms
and
raised
him
to
his
feet
all
he
realized
was
that
he
had
run
squarely
into
the
hands
of
those
he
had
tried
so
hard
to
avoid
chapter
ned
griffin
brings
news
after
accompanying
our
confederate
hero
rodney
gray
through
fifteen
months
of
army
life
during
which
he
saw
more
adventures
endured
more
hardships
and
learned
more
wisdom
than
he
had
ever
dreamed
of
we
left
him
at
the
close
of
the
second
volume
of
this
series
safe
in
the
home
of
his
boyhood
which
he
had
left
for
the
avowed
purpose
of
driving
the
yankees
out
of
missouri
he
confidently
assured
his
mother
and
the
servants
who
assembled
to
see
him
off
that
it
would
not
take
more
than
three
or
four
months
to
do
that
and
then
he
would
return
like
lentulus
of
old
with
victorious
eagles
instead
of
that
he
came
back
as
ragged
and
disgusted
a
specimen
of
a
confederate
volunteer
as
could
be
found
anywhere
in
the
south
at
the
time
of
which
we
write
and
that
is
saying
a
good
deal
the
summer
clothing
given
him
and
his
comrades
at
tupelo
after
the
retreat
from
corinth
and
which
had
been
furnished
by
one
of
the
numerous
ladies
associations
of
the
south
was
not
calculated
to
stand
soldier
treatment
the
trousers
rodney
wore
were
made
of
a
rich
shawl
and
his
blouse
had
once
been
part
of
a
costly
silk
dress
his
nights
at
the
and
the
days
he
had
passed
trudging
along
dusty
roads
had
played
sad
havoc
with
his
pictured
uniform
that
was
what
dick
graham
called
it
and
his
regiment
which
had
been
pretty
well
supplied
with
clothing
of
the
same
description
presented
a
very
fantastic
appearance
the
first
time
they
went
on
dress
parade
you
will
remember
that
rodney
brought
dick
home
with
him
dick
wanted
to
get
into
missouri
where
his
parents
were
and
in
order
to
do
that
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
find
some
point
on
the
mississippi
that
was
not
guarded
by
federal
gunboats
they
came
from
camp
pinckney
on
foot
and
had
been
doing
duty
as
infantrymen
for
months
although
their
regiment
was
always
spoken
of
as
the
missouri
cavalry
their
horses
had
been
confiscated
by
the
commissary
department
during
that
dreary
mud
march
from
the
disastrous
battlefield
of
pea
ridge
to
van
buren
and
pocahontas
the
commanding
general
van
dorn
did
not
need
cavalry
during
that
march
but
it
was
necessary
that
his
wagon
train
should
go
through
so
as
fast
as
his
jaded
teams
gave
out
and
dropped
in
the
road
he
took
cavalry
horses
to
replace
them
and
in
process
of
time
the
two
barrington
boys
found
themselves
on
foot
like
hundreds
of
others
you
will
remember
too
that
when
rodney
reached
home
he
led
his
friend
into
the
parlor
and
pushed
him
into
an
with
the
words
stay
here
till
i
find
somebody
and
that
his
mother
came
in
a
moment
later
the
way
in
which
the
two
greeted
each
other
after
their
long
separation
was
something
of
which
dick
graham
could
not
remain
an
unmoved
spectator
for
it
made
him
think
of
his
own
mother
away
off
across
the
river
whom
he
might
never
see
again
he
staggered
rather
than
walked
to
the
window
and
looked
out
at
the
oleanders
in
the
yard
o
rodney
is
it
possible
that
you
have
come
back
to
me
at
last
exclaimed
gray
tearfully
and
dick
knew
without
turning
his
head
that
she
was
holding
her
stalwart
son
off
at
arms
length
and
giving
him
a
good
looking
over
yes
sir
replied
the
returned
soldier
placing
his
arm
about
his
mother
waist
and
leading
her
toward
a
sofa
i
have
come
back
and
i
have
come
to
stay
the
last
words
you
said
to
me
right
out
there
on
the
gallery
were
that
you
never
wanted
to
hear
that
i
had
failed
to
do
my
duty
you
have
heard
any
such
report
as
that
have
you
i
have
done
the
best
i
could
but
i
have
come
back
whipped
and
i
wish
every
other
man
who
wears
a
gray
jacket
were
honest
enough
to
say
the
same
thing
the
listening
dick
expected
to
hear
his
chum
soundly
rebuked
for
giving
utterance
to
such
sentiments
because
he
knew
that
the
women
were
much
more
zealous
for
the
cause
of
southern
independence
than
their
male
relatives
that
they
were
exerting
themselves
to
the
utmost
to
keep
the
war
spirit
at
fever
heat
and
that
if
it
had
been
for
them
the
army
from
which
he
had
just
been
discharged
would
have
dwindled
to
a
corporal
guard
long
ago
by
an
accidental
glance
into
a
mirror
that
hung
on
a
side
wall
dick
saw
that
gray
was
holding
her
soldier
boy
tightly
clasped
in
her
arms
but
he
did
not
hear
her
utter
one
word
of
reproach
like
many
another
mother
her
patriotism
had
been
sorely
tried
and
now
that
rodney
had
returned
safe
and
sound
she
considered
that
she
had
done
all
for
the
cause
that
could
be
expected
of
her
and
hoped
that
he
would
never
leave
her
side
again
let
some
other
randolph
for
rodney
place
at
the
front
say
exclaimed
rodney
starting
up
all
of
a
sudden
what
the
matter
here
this
room
does
look
just
as
it
did
the
last
time
i
saw
it
where
the
carpet
it
was
cut
into
blankets
and
sent
to
corinth
along
with
a
lot
of
other
things
that
i
thought
might
be
of
use
to
you
ragged
shivering
soldiers
replied
his
mother
i
hoped
you
would
never
be
called
upon
to
make
the
smallest
sacrifice
said
rodney
in
a
tone
of
disgust
do
you
think
i
made
no
sacrifice
when
i
sent
you
to
the
field
said
gray
reproachfully
o
rodney
i
did
mean
that
said
the
boy
quickly
but
you
do
want
to
rob
yourself
for
the
sake
of
those
fellows
up
there
bobbing
his
head
in
the
direction
in
which
he
supposed
bragg
army
to
be
like
as
not
the
poor
foolish
woman
who
cut
her
shawl
up
to
make
these
trousers
of
mine
will
suffer
with
cold
for
the
want
of
it
but
i
am
forgetting
something
come
here
old
fellow
mother
you
have
often
heard
me
speak
of
dick
graham
the
only
brother
i
got
well
here
he
is
rags
and
dust
and
all
that
dick
kiss
him
for
his
mother
and
tell
me
where
i
will
find
father
the
lonely
homesick
young
missourian
was
almost
overwhelmed
by
the
kindly
greeting
that
rodney
mother
gave
him
but
his
friend
was
quick
to
notice
it
and
came
to
his
relief
when
his
mother
said
that
gray
had
gone
to
mooreville
on
business
and
might
not
be
back
for
an
hour
or
two
he
seized
dick
by
the
arm
and
hurried
him
up
to
his
room
i
have
known
you
a
good
while
but
i
never
saw
you
look
so
glum
before
said
he
as
he
closed
the
door
and
forced
dick
into
a
seat
you
may
well
say
that
replied
the
latter
i
bore
up
pretty
well
until
i
saw
you
and
your
mother
together
and
that
knocked
me
it
a
fur
ways
to
little
rock
and
there
are
a
good
many
yanks
on
the
road
i
trust
you
and
your
discharge
to
get
along
with
the
yankee
cavalry
if
i
can
only
see
you
safe
over
the
river
said
rodney
there
is
where
the
fun
is
going
to
come
in
do
you
think
that
the
commanding
naval
officer
or
the
provost
marshal
at
baton
rouge
might
be
prevailed
upon
to
give
me
permission
to
go
over
openly
and
inquired
dick
not
much
you
would
do
it
yourself
if
you
were
in
their
places
how
would
they
know
but
that
you
were
a
spy
or
a
bearer
of
secret
despatches
and
that
your
discharge
was
a
humbug
i
tell
you
dick
since
i
have
had
time
to
think
of
the
way
those
yankee
scouts
treated
us
when
they
told
us
to
come
in
out
of
the
wet
i
confess
to
a
very
friendly
feeling
for
the
yankees
how
many
are
there
who
would
have
run
us
in
just
to
be
able
to
say
that
they
had
captured
a
couple
of
graybacks
that
so
assented
dick
now
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
stay
with
me
long
enough
to
rest
your
hands
and
face
say
a
week
or
such
a
matter
and
then
we
go
up
to
suffering
moses
exclaimed
dick
there
is
a
portion
of
two
yankee
fleets
up
there
according
to
the
last
report
i
read
and
they
are
fighting
our
fellows
all
the
time
well
say
port
hudson
then
there
has
been
much
of
any
fighting
there
we
buy
a
light
tight
boat
and
provision
here
dick
straightened
up
and
turned
his
pockets
inside
out
one
after
the
other
to
show
that
they
were
empty
i
know
what
you
mean
by
that
exclaimed
rodney
but
i
see
that
you
have
all
the
money
you
i
said
and
not
such
stuff
as
that
he
added
thrusting
his
hand
into
his
pocket
and
pulling
out
the
roll
of
confederate
scrip
that
the
paymaster
had
given
him
with
his
discharge
mother
was
wild
for
southern
independence
when
this
thing
was
first
started
but
thought
it
wise
to
prepare
for
a
rainy
day
so
she
and
father
and
i
put
away
a
little
gold
if
it
was
for
the
fact
that
my
father
and
mother
did
the
same
thing
i
call
you
a
traitor
said
dick
oh
i
know
we
are
in
good
company
answered
rodney
with
a
laugh
and
we
do
think
any
the
less
of
ourselves
for
putting
away
that
gold
either
think
what
a
fix
washington
army
was
in
when
it
was
mustered
out
at
newburgh
those
men
were
victorious
but
even
victors
must
eat
and
have
something
to
wear
and
what
did
they
have
to
live
on
do
you
suppose
they
would
have
thought
seriously
of
mutiny
if
they
had
had
a
little
store
of
hard
stuff
to
fall
back
on
that
why
we
hid
the
gold
and
it
does
make
any
difference
what
sort
of
laws
the
government
at
richmond
passes
we
are
going
to
keep
what
we
have
now
let
me
show
you
how
much
my
old
company
thought
of
me
although
rodney
room
had
been
regularly
cared
for
during
the
long
months
it
had
been
without
an
occupant
he
noticed
the
moment
he
went
into
it
that
nothing
had
been
disturbed
a
newspaper
which
he
had
tossed
upon
the
floor
the
morning
he
left
was
lying
in
nearly
the
same
spot
yet
and
his
light
was
standing
in
the
corner
where
he
had
placed
it
after
shooting
a
hawk
that
was
bothering
aunt
chickens
he
opened
the
door
of
his
closet
as
he
spoke
and
almost
without
looking
put
his
hand
upon
the
elegant
cavalry
sabre
that
bob
hubbard
rangers
had
given
him
the
uniform
he
had
worn
while
acting
as
and
his
military
saddle
and
bridle
were
there
too
i
left
them
at
home
because
i
knew
they
would
get
me
captured
if
i
tried
to
take
them
into
missouri
said
he
now
pull
off
that
he
added
nodding
toward
dick
silk
blouse
and
after
you
have
removed
a
little
of
the
louisiana
soil
from
your
features
put
on
this
citizen
suit
i
am
not
sure
it
will
fit
you
but
it
is
the
best
i
can
do
until
i
see
how
trade
is
i
suppose
gold
is
as
potent
in
baton
rouge
as
it
was
in
little
rock
said
dick
but
do
you
think
our
discharges
will
take
us
inside
the
yankee
lines
we
make
them
replied
rodney
we
say
that
we
want
to
report
ourselves
to
the
provost
marshal
and
get
a
paper
of
some
kind
from
him
that
will
keep
the
federal
scouts
from
bothering
us
and
when
we
see
him
we
bounce
him
for
permission
to
trade
the
boys
went
to
work
to
make
such
improvements
in
their
personal
appearance
as
they
could
with
plenty
of
soap
and
water
and
abundant
wardrobe
and
when
a
bell
rang
in
a
lower
hall
half
an
hour
later
they
answered
it
looking
quite
unlike
the
dusty
ragamuffins
who
had
walked
unbidden
into
gray
front
parlor
it
is
true
that
their
coats
were
a
little
short
in
the
sleeves
and
tight
across
the
shoulders
but
there
were
no
holes
in
them
or
in
the
light
shoes
they
wore
on
their
feet
that
all
mother
said
rodney
catching
a
momentary
glimpse
of
a
table
through
the
open
door
when
you
ca
think
of
any
other
way
to
put
in
the
time
just
ask
us
if
we
want
something
to
eat
now
come
and
sit
down
with
us
and
tell
us
everything
happened
since
i
have
been
in
the
army
rodney
entrance
into
the
dining
room
seemed
to
be
the
signal
that
the
house
servants
had
been
waiting
for
the
moment
he
stepped
over
the
threshold
they
rushed
in
through
every
door
some
smiling
some
laughing
outright
and
all
pushing
and
crowding
one
another
in
the
effort
to
be
the
first
to
shake
young
moster
by
the
hand
foremost
in
the
struggle
was
rosebud
the
darkey
who
had
been
rodney
playmate
in
the
days
of
his
babyhood
and
who
yelled
so
dolefully
when
he
went
away
although
they
all
inquired
particularly
after
his
health
there
was
not
one
among
them
who
asked
what
he
thought
of
the
yankees
as
fighters
now
that
he
had
had
some
experience
with
them
they
knew
as
well
as
he
did
that
he
and
his
comrades
had
failed
utterly
in
their
efforts
to
take
missouri
out
of
the
union
gray
could
not
describe
in
one
dinner
hour
everything
that
had
happened
in
and
around
mooreville
during
the
last
fifteen
months
nor
could
she
do
it
in
a
dozen
hours
and
even
at
the
end
of
a
week
she
and
her
husband
had
many
questions
to
answer
as
well
as
many
to
ask
but
before
he
went
to
bed
that
night
rodney
knew
pretty
nearly
what
tom
randolph
and
his
home
guards
had
been
doing
and
how
he
and
the
enrolling
officer
stood
in
the
community
and
had
been
made
to
see
at
least
one
thing
very
clearly
the
surest
way
for
him
to
keep
out
of
the
army
was
to
follow
ned
griffin
example
and
take
a
position
as
overseer
on
one
of
his
father
plantations
i
am
overjoyed
to
know
that
you
have
decided
to
remain
at
home
with
us
said
his
father
but
to
be
honest
i
did
not
look
for
it
so
i
gave
griffin
the
best
opening
i
had
our
upper
plantation
as
you
are
aware
is
right
in
the
middle
of
the
woods
but
i
think
ned
will
be
willing
to
make
the
change
if
i
ask
him
not
for
the
world
said
rodney
quickly
i
am
used
to
living
in
the
woods
so
i
will
take
the
little
farm
and
let
ned
and
his
mother
stay
near
civilization
where
they
can
see
white
folks
once
in
a
while
besides
i
rather
like
to
be
within
reach
of
the
cotton
you
got
up
there
a
northern
paper
that
came
into
our
hands
just
before
we
left
tupelo
contained
the
information
that
there
going
to
be
trading
allowed
along
the
river
and
what
the
yanks
especially
want
is
cotton
i
do
blame
them
said
gray
with
a
smile
it
is
worth
sixty
cents
a
pound
in
new
york
this
piece
of
news
almost
took
rodney
breath
away
four
hundred
and
fifty
bales
me
see
great
scott
father
that
does
look
as
though
you
are
going
to
be
reduced
to
beggary
but
you
must
bear
in
mind
that
our
cotton
is
not
in
new
york
but
concealed
in
the
depths
of
a
swamp
said
his
mother
and
rodney
afterward
had
occasion
to
recall
the
words
when
he
was
working
night
and
day
with
sailor
jack
assistance
and
marcy
to
keep
this
cotton
out
of
the
hands
of
rascals
both
union
and
confederate
who
were
trying
their
best
to
take
it
from
him
by
force
or
to
cheat
him
out
of
it
this
news
was
so
very
important
that
it
could
be
talked
of
only
in
whispers
and
after
the
difficulties
that
lay
in
the
way
of
getting
the
cotton
into
the
hands
of
the
traders
had
been
discussed
in
tones
so
low
that
no
eavesdropper
at
the
door
could
have
heard
a
word
of
it
gray
said
in
her
ordinary
voice
you
boys
have
often
spoken
of
having
northern
papers
in
your
possession
did
your
officers
permit
that
well
no
said
rodney
with
a
laugh
it
was
against
orders
to
look
at
one
of
them
and
i
have
seen
men
triced
up
by
the
thumbs
for
disregarding
that
order
then
how
did
they
get
inside
our
lines
they
were
taken
from
dead
yanks
or
out
of
the
pockets
of
prisoners
replied
rodney
sometimes
they
were
handed
over
to
an
officer
or
thrown
aside
to
be
picked
up
by
other
men
who
did
care
so
much
for
orders
and
those
who
got
them
were
mighty
careful
to
know
who
was
around
when
they
took
them
out
to
read
them
why
mother
i
am
telling
you
the
gospel
truth
when
i
say
that
all
the
reliable
news
we
army
fellows
got
was
what
came
to
us
through
the
columns
of
northern
papers
or
from
the
mouths
of
northern
prisoners
but
as
i
was
and
over
that
what
your
cotton
is
worth
father
and
i
will
take
the
little
farm
so
as
to
be
where
i
can
see
it
once
in
a
while
there
were
so
many
questions
to
be
asked
and
answered
that
rodney
and
dick
scarcely
stirred
out
of
the
house
during
the
whole
of
the
next
day
on
the
second
day
they
rode
out
to
call
upon
ned
griffin
and
his
mother
both
of
whom
shed
tears
of
joy
and
gratitude
when
they
took
rodney
by
the
hand
yes
thanks
to
your
father
kindness
i
am
here
yet
said
ned
wiping
his
eyes
which
grew
misty
every
time
he
spoke
of
his
benefactor
though
mercy
knows
how
i
am
going
to
pay
the
debt
i
shall
owe
him
when
the
terms
of
the
conscription
law
are
complied
with
a
hundred
pounds
of
beef
and
bacon
for
every
darkey
on
this
place
big
and
little
and
beef
and
bacon
way
up
yonder
said
ned
pointing
to
the
ceiling
it
will
take
me
a
lifetime
to
pay
it
oh
no
it
wo
said
rodney
encouragingly
for
if
goods
are
high
your
services
will
command
wages
in
proportion
do
you
see
do
you
imagine
that
i
will
ever
charge
your
father
a
cent
after
what
he
has
done
for
me
cried
ned
indignantly
i
am
not
that
kind
of
a
fellow
and
you
ought
to
know
it
well
i
suppose
that
is
sentiment
but
it
is
business
said
the
practical
rodney
now
then
what
do
you
know
have
you
the
straight
of
the
fights
the
home
guards
had
with
those
gunboats
ned
laughed
until
he
was
red
in
the
face
and
then
went
on
to
give
the
straight
of
one
fight
as
he
had
heard
it
from
indignant
citizens
of
baton
rouge
who
had
petitioned
general
williams
the
union
commander
to
send
a
company
of
cavalry
to
mooreville
with
orders
to
exterminate
the
home
guards
or
drive
them
from
the
country
the
boys
heard
much
the
same
story
from
several
disabled
veterans
of
bragg
army
upon
whom
they
called
on
their
way
home
and
that
was
the
way
rodney
came
to
know
so
much
about
what
had
been
transpiring
along
the
river
during
his
absence
he
and
dick
also
learned
from
various
sources
that
the
enrolling
officer
would
prove
to
be
a
jolly
and
entertaining
companion
when
once
they
became
acquainted
with
him
but
as
he
was
tom
friend
they
had
better
not
trust
him
too
far
at
first
perhaps
we
not
trust
him
at
all
said
rodney
we
can
tell
better
after
we
have
had
a
look
at
him
as
we
are
not
in
the
confederate
service
we
are
under
no
obligations
to
go
near
him
still
he
might
look
upon
it
as
a
courteous
and
friendly
act
if
we
were
to
drop
into
his
office
and
tell
him
with
this
object
in
view
they
rode
to
mooreville
on
the
afternoon
of
the
next
day
and
that
was
the
time
they
saw
tom
randolph
and
frightened
him
nearly
out
of
his
wits
as
we
have
recorded
by
assuring
him
that
he
need
not
expect
to
take
a
squad
of
conscripts
to
camp
pinckney
without
having
a
brush
with
the
union
cavalry
it
was
after
they
left
him
that
they
heard
the
hounds
giving
tongue
in
the
woods
but
such
sounds
were
common
enough
in
that
country
and
so
they
paid
no
attention
to
it
although
they
might
have
done
so
had
they
been
able
to
look
far
enough
into
the
future
to
see
what
was
going
to
happen
afterward
when
they
reached
the
enrolling
office
rodney
found
that
he
knew
everyone
there
except
the
officer
in
charge
and
as
he
shook
hands
with
some
and
barely
nodded
to
others
he
told
himself
that
they
were
just
the
sort
of
men
he
expected
to
find
in
tom
randolph
company
of
home
guards
there
were
a
few
industrious
ones
among
them
but
the
majority
were
lazy
vagabonds
who
had
never
been
known
to
earn
an
honest
living
they
a
pretty
set
to
fight
a
gunboat
he
whispered
to
dick
while
the
two
were
hitching
their
horses
at
the
rack
and
i
bet
my
roll
of
confederate
scrip
against
yours
that
they
never
take
any
conscripts
to
the
camp
of
instruction
i
go
farther
and
say
that
they
will
never
start
with
any
for
when
they
are
wanted
they
not
be
found
now
let
go
in
and
see
what
sort
of
a
chap
we
have
to
deal
with
dick
graham
put
him
down
at
once
as
a
conceited
prig
who
did
not
know
a
thing
outside
of
office
routine
and
was
so
disgusted
with
the
airs
he
tried
to
throw
on
that
he
did
not
salute
when
he
handed
out
his
discharge
but
rodney
who
did
not
care
any
more
for
the
enrolling
officer
than
he
did
for
a
crooked
stick
in
the
road
pursued
a
different
course
and
very
soon
succeeded
in
making
captain
roach
ashamed
of
himself
he
made
him
see
that
there
was
a
big
difference
between
a
veteran
soldier
and
a
home
guard
and
ended
by
asking
him
to
dinner
now
you
done
it
said
dick
as
the
two
mounted
their
horses
and
rode
homeward
if
your
mother
had
wanted
that
officer
at
her
table
do
you
think
she
would
have
asked
him
long
ago
oh
that
all
right
said
rodney
we
privileged
characters
and
my
folks
will
back
up
anything
we
do
or
say
besides
during
the
last
three
days
i
got
to
be
a
policy
man
what
do
you
mean
by
that
just
this
so
long
as
captain
roach
collogues
with
tom
randolph
and
his
the
one
i
am
afraid
of
for
she
is
a
schemer
from
the
word
go
i
tell
long
will
he
be
more
or
less
under
their
influence
and
i
am
well
enough
acquainted
with
them
to
know
that
they
would
not
hesitate
to
say
or
do
anything
that
came
into
their
heads
if
they
thought
they
could
set
him
against
me
so
i
wanted
the
first
chance
at
the
captain
there
no
telling
at
what
moment
he
may
be
able
to
do
us
a
good
turn
when
the
boys
reached
home
they
were
surprised
to
find
that
there
was
a
good
deal
of
suppressed
excitement
among
the
servants
which
showed
itself
now
and
then
in
spite
of
all
their
efforts
to
keep
it
concealed
rodney
black
playmate
who
came
to
the
steps
to
take
charge
of
their
horses
was
full
of
news
but
his
master
could
not
get
anything
out
of
him
although
he
threatened
if
he
did
not
speak
to
take
him
on
board
the
gunboats
and
sell
him
to
the
yankees
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
when
they
went
into
the
house
they
met
gray
whose
face
showed
that
she
was
not
altogether
at
her
ease
what
up
demanded
rodney
nothing
more
than
we
can
expect
in
times
like
these
i
suppose
she
replied
with
a
smile
but
the
blacks
are
frightened
and
of
course
that
has
an
effect
on
me
there
are
four
escaped
union
prisoners
in
the
vicinity
and
some
confederate
soldiers
are
pursuing
them
with
bloodhounds
dick
graham
took
note
of
the
fact
that
she
did
not
say
some
of
soldiers
as
almost
every
other
southern
woman
would
have
done
he
thought
of
the
federal
scouts
who
had
captured
and
released
himself
and
rodney
a
few
days
before
and
said
mentally
i
hope
they
not
catch
them
i
wish
we
could
find
them
long
enough
to
hand
them
a
bottle
of
turpentine
that
would
throw
the
dogs
off
their
trail
in
short
order
well
what
are
the
blacks
frightened
at
continued
rodney
the
yanks
do
make
war
on
people
of
their
color
but
they
know
that
there
are
two
soldiers
in
this
began
gray
now
i
understand
it
exclaimed
rodney
and
that
was
the
reason
rosebud
would
tell
me
what
he
had
on
his
mind
though
i
promised
to
sell
him
if
he
did
he
was
afraid
that
dick
and
i
would
saddle
up
and
go
after
those
prisoners
well
we
not
making
war
on
yanks
so
much
as
we
were
so
you
can
rest
easy
mother
but
how
did
you
find
it
out
we
did
hear
a
word
of
it
in
town
or
along
the
road
three
of
the
pursuing
party
rode
into
the
yard
not
half
an
hour
ago
to
tell
me
of
it
and
to
ask
if
i
thought
any
of
our
blacks
would
be
likely
to
feed
and
shelter
the
federals
if
they
came
on
the
plantation
answered
gray
and
i
could
only
say
truthfully
that
i
was
sure
they
would
the
soldiers
do
not
mean
to
give
the
poor
fellows
any
rest
or
the
least
chance
to
escape
to
the
river
ejaculated
rodney
is
a
yank
a
poor
fellow
in
your
estimation
a
weary
and
hungry
man
is
always
an
object
of
pity
replied
his
mother
and
such
have
never
been
turned
from
this
plantation
without
having
their
wants
relieved
and
now
the
soldiers
have
gone
and
put
those
dreadful
home
guards
after
them
haw
haw
laughed
rodney
tom
randolph
home
guards
may
be
dreadful
to
unarmed
union
men
who
have
never
snuffed
powder
but
veterans
such
as
i
take
these
escaped
prisoners
to
be
wo
stand
in
fear
of
them
why
mother
if
these
four
men
were
armed
they
would
whip
tom
whole
company
they
are
thoroughly
armed
said
gray
and
when
they
are
in
need
of
food
they
walk
right
into
a
plantation
house
and
demand
it
that
all
right
too
you
do
expect
men
to
go
hungry
when
grub
in
sight
just
because
they
have
the
misfortune
to
be
yanks
do
you
where
did
they
get
their
weapons
gray
shuddered
as
she
told
the
story
as
we
have
already
heard
it
and
when
she
described
how
the
fugitives
had
surprised
captured
and
paroled
a
squad
of
six
men
who
had
been
sent
in
pursuit
of
them
rodney
face
and
dick
beamed
with
admiration
i
bet
they
are
bricks
said
the
former
chimed
in
dick
and
do
the
home
guards
know
that
the
yanks
are
armed
continued
rodney
if
they
do
there
is
a
man
in
the
company
who
will
join
in
the
pursuit
they
make
a
big
show
of
going
if
tom
orders
them
out
but
the
first
good
chance
they
get
they
hide
in
the
woods
and
i
do
know
that
i
blame
them
observed
dick
nor
me
there
no
fun
in
walking
up
on
an
armed
and
desperate
man
when
he
is
concealed
and
can
see
every
move
you
make
while
you
can
not
see
hide
nor
hair
of
him
mother
here
he
sunk
his
voice
to
a
whisper
i
hope
they
wo
catch
those
fellows
and
if
they
come
around
this
house
i
help
them
if
i
can
here
too
whispered
dick
and
gray
never
uttered
a
word
of
rebuke
the
boys
believed
that
she
would
help
them
herself
when
gray
came
in
the
matter
was
talked
over
again
and
he
did
not
appear
to
be
very
anxious
that
the
fugitives
should
be
captured
on
the
contrary
he
discussed
their
chances
of
escape
with
great
composure
and
said
he
thought
their
prospects
would
be
brighter
than
they
were
if
they
only
had
somebody
with
them
who
could
show
them
how
to
throw
off
the
dogs
these
dogs
were
not
intended
to
seize
the
fugitives
you
will
understand
but
merely
to
overtake
and
hold
them
at
bay
until
the
soldiers
could
come
up
large
packs
of
trained
nigger
dogs
would
sometimes
pull
down
a
single
man
when
they
found
him
in
the
woods
and
it
is
a
matter
of
history
that
some
of
our
poor
fellows
who
escaped
from
andersonville
were
sadly
torn
by
them
but
the
four
escaped
prisoners
in
question
did
not
come
near
house
that
night
or
if
they
did
rodney
and
dick
never
knew
it
it
was
on
the
morning
of
the
next
day
just
as
breakfast
was
nearly
over
that
the
first
exciting
thing
happened
ned
griffin
rode
into
the
yard
and
on
his
way
to
the
back
porch
he
passed
along
the
in
front
of
one
of
the
windows
rodney
had
a
fair
view
of
his
face
as
he
rode
by
and
ned
looked
through
the
open
window
and
saw
rodney
and
in
an
instant
a
signal
passed
from
one
to
the
signal
so
very
slight
that
no
one
but
a
schoolboy
would
have
noticed
it
but
it
told
rodney
as
plainly
as
words
that
ned
had
news
for
him
that
he
did
not
want
to
divulge
in
the
presence
of
any
third
party
so
rodney
hastily
excused
himself
and
went
out
on
the
porch
you
look
just
as
rosebud
did
when
i
came
home
last
evening
said
he
when
he
saw
ned
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
holding
his
horse
by
the
bridle
but
i
hope
you
will
be
more
accommodating
than
he
was
for
he
would
not
tell
what
he
had
on
his
mind
say
replied
ned
he
looked
all
around
to
make
sure
that
there
was
no
else
within
hearing
and
then
went
on
you
heard
about
those
escaped
yankees
did
you
i
heard
all
about
them
what
of
it
they
came
to
our
house
last
night
that
all
right
you
treated
them
white
did
you
i
treated
them
the
best
i
knew
how
i
thought
you
and
your
father
would
care
of
course
not
but
we
would
care
if
you
had
treated
them
any
other
way
what
of
it
they
want
me
to
guide
them
to
baton
rouge
continued
ned
and
then
rodney
noticed
that
the
hand
with
which
he
held
his
bridle
trembled
like
a
leaf
that
all
right
too
and
i
do
see
anything
alarming
in
it
why
do
you
do
it
i
am
perfectly
willing
to
do
it
but
you
see
they
have
got
tom
randolph
with
them
and
wo
give
him
up
they
are
bound
to
take
him
into
the
city
as
a
prisoner
for
they
captured
him
in
uniform
this
astounding
information
almost
knocked
rodney
over
he
sat
down
on
the
topmost
step
rested
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
his
chin
on
his
hands
and
looked
at
ned
without
speaking
chapter
xi
the
escaped
prisoners
story
i
tried
my
level
best
to
induce
the
yanks
to
let
tom
randolph
go
free
and
so
did
mother
continued
ned
slipping
the
bridle
over
his
head
and
seating
himself
on
the
steps
at
rodney
feet
but
they
would
hear
to
it
the
worst
of
it
is
they
scared
the
life
out
of
tom
and
made
him
confess
everything
i
am
sorry
to
hear
that
replied
rodney
who
had
leisure
while
ned
was
speaking
to
gather
a
few
of
his
wits
about
him
if
tom
told
how
he
persecuted
unarmed
union
men
in
this
settlement
he
a
goner
sure
enough
for
there
is
a
soldier
in
the
world
who
will
stand
such
work
as
that
i
do
believe
he
said
a
word
about
it
exclaimed
ned
then
what
in
the
name
of
sense
did
he
have
to
confess
about
fighting
those
gunboats
you
know
he
never
fought
any
gunboats
declared
rodney
impatiently
what
do
you
suppose
possesses
him
to
stick
to
that
lie
every
chance
he
gets
one
would
think
he
get
tired
of
it
after
a
while
i
asked
him
that
very
question
when
the
yanks
permitted
me
to
have
a
little
private
talk
with
him
said
ned
and
the
reason
he
gave
was
this
he
had
heard
that
brave
men
respected
brave
men
and
he
hoped
his
captors
would
treat
him
with
a
little
more
courtesy
if
they
knew
that
he
was
a
valiant
soldier
rodney
gray
was
utterly
confounded
valiant
great
scott
there
is
a
bigger
coward
in
the
confederacy
than
tom
randolph
he
exclaimed
but
you
see
the
yankees
do
know
that
and
tom
has
stuffed
them
so
full
of
his
ridiculous
stories
that
they
imagine
they
have
got
hold
of
a
second
mosby
or
morgan
and
that
he
is
worth
keeping
did
you
tell
them
all
this
inquired
rodney
of
course
i
did
but
although
they
know
that
i
am
a
union
man
and
down
on
everything
that
looks
like
secession
or
rebellion
they
would
not
believe
me
and
you
will
have
to
go
up
and
try
what
you
can
do
that
is
if
you
feel
like
helping
one
who
has
always
done
his
best
to
injure
you
i
like
to
take
tom
randolph
right
out
there
in
the
carriage
road
and
punch
his
head
for
him
this
minute
replied
rodney
but
i
am
not
coward
enough
to
take
vengeance
on
him
in
any
other
way
i
go
of
course
but
i
do
imagine
they
will
pay
any
more
attention
to
me
than
they
did
to
you
yes
they
will
for
they
know
you
know
me
cried
rodney
opening
his
eyes
wide
with
amazement
i
reckon
not
i
do
know
a
living
yank
well
they
know
you
and
dick
graham
as
well
insisted
ned
they
remember
perfectly
of
reading
your
names
on
the
discharges
you
showed
when
they
captured
you
between
here
and
camp
pinckney
rodney
gray
had
got
upon
his
feet
but
when
he
heard
these
words
he
sat
down
again
he
stared
hard
at
ned
as
if
he
were
trying
to
understand
something
that
was
too
hard
for
him
and
shouted
rosebud
what
are
you
going
to
do
asked
ned
when
in
response
to
the
summons
the
darkey
came
tumbling
out
of
the
kitchen
with
a
slice
of
bacon
in
one
hand
and
a
chunk
of
corn
pone
in
the
other
i
am
going
to
ask
you
to
come
into
the
house
and
tell
your
story
to
dick
and
the
folks
from
beginning
to
end
answered
rodney
give
your
horse
to
rosebud
and
come
on
ned
griffin
followed
his
conductor
with
some
reluctance
for
he
did
not
know
what
a
man
who
had
fitted
out
half
a
dozen
partisan
rangers
and
who
was
a
large
slaveholder
besides
might
think
of
an
overseer
who
gave
aid
and
comfort
to
union
soldiers
and
abolitionists
without
saying
a
word
to
him
about
it
the
rodney
must
have
known
what
he
was
thinking
about
for
after
placing
ned
in
a
chair
and
carefully
closing
all
the
doors
that
gave
entrance
into
the
dining
room
he
walked
up
to
his
father
and
whispered
those
escaped
prisoners
were
up
to
ned
last
night
and
he
is
afraid
you
will
think
hard
of
him
for
giving
them
a
bite
to
eat
and
loaning
them
blankets
too
gray
chimed
in
honest
ned
who
meant
that
his
employer
should
know
the
full
extent
of
his
offending
they
had
blankets
enough
first
and
last
but
were
so
hard
pressed
by
the
dogs
that
they
had
to
throw
away
everything
except
their
guns
well
i
assure
you
that
i
do
think
hard
of
you
for
giving
hungry
men
something
to
eat
and
a
bed
to
sleep
on
said
gray
i
should
have
done
the
same
thing
myself
if
they
had
applied
to
me
but
i
trust
you
exercised
due
care
while
you
were
doing
it
i
know
what
you
mean
sir
answered
ned
and
there
is
a
white
person
living
who
knows
what
happened
on
that
plantation
last
night
except
my
mother
and
tom
randolph
a
shell
from
one
of
the
gunboats
in
front
of
baton
rouge
could
scarcely
have
created
greater
consternation
in
that
room
than
ned
last
words
gray
thought
that
ned
doings
might
as
well
be
published
in
richmond
at
once
and
was
about
to
say
as
much
when
rodney
took
a
great
load
from
his
mind
and
astonished
him
almost
beyond
measure
at
the
same
time
by
quietly
remarking
that
tom
was
a
prisoner
in
the
hands
of
the
yankees
who
were
bent
on
taking
him
to
baton
rouge
then
he
requested
ned
to
tell
them
just
what
had
happened
on
his
plantation
the
night
before
and
the
latter
gave
the
particulars
substantially
as
follows
the
first
ned
and
his
mother
heard
of
the
escaped
prisoners
was
through
one
of
the
house
servants
who
declared
with
much
earnestness
that
she
could
not
remember
just
who
told
her
the
news
but
it
was
in
everybody
mouth
and
some
of
the
field
hands
she
did
know
who
had
seen
and
talked
with
white
men
who
had
seen
and
talked
with
the
confederate
soldiers
who
were
following
the
trail
of
the
fugitives
she
did
not
try
to
conceal
her
joy
when
she
informed
griffin
that
dem
yanks
was
boun
to
get
safe
to
de
ribber
kase
dey
had
done
pass
mooreville
de
night
befo
and
de
houn
dogs
had
done
been
heared
givin
tongue
in
de
woods
ten
miles
from
baton
rouge
being
intensely
loyal
to
the
old
flag
and
friendly
to
those
who
wore
the
blue
ned
hoped
from
the
bottom
of
his
heart
that
this
report
was
true
but
understanding
the
negro
nature
as
well
as
he
did
he
could
not
believe
more
than
half
of
it
he
told
his
mother
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
among
the
slaves
to
shield
those
four
men
and
that
they
might
be
concealed
on
the
plantation
for
a
month
and
no
white
person
would
know
a
thing
about
it
consequently
he
was
not
prepared
for
what
took
place
about
an
hour
after
dark
he
was
in
the
act
of
blowing
out
his
lantern
after
seeing
that
everything
was
snug
for
the
night
he
had
been
the
rounds
of
the
quarter
to
make
sure
that
the
darkeys
were
all
in
their
cabins
where
they
belonged
had
shaken
the
padlocks
on
the
and
smoke
house
assured
himself
that
his
chickens
were
all
roosting
high
and
being
entirely
satisfied
with
his
day
work
was
preparing
for
a
quiet
evening
with
his
mother
when
there
came
a
knock
at
the
back
door
ned
opened
it
and
saw
his
negro
foreman
standing
there
cæsar
he
exclaimed
did
i
leave
you
at
your
cabin
not
more
than
ten
minutes
ago
you
ought
to
be
in
bed
by
this
time
oh
yes
sah
i
was
dah
replied
cæsar
with
a
chuckle
kase
i
knowed
mighty
well
dat
you
be
around
to
see
if
i
was
dah
but
step
out
hyar
a
minute
please
sah
ned
went
out
closing
the
door
behind
him
and
was
surprised
as
well
as
startled
to
find
himself
confronted
by
two
men
who
carried
guns
in
their
hands
the
night
was
so
dark
that
he
could
not
see
their
faces
or
clothing
and
his
first
thought
was
that
some
of
the
home
guards
had
come
to
pay
him
what
their
commander
humorously
called
a
visit
of
ceremony
if
that
was
the
case
ned
knew
that
the
house
in
which
he
lived
would
be
ransacked
and
robbed
and
he
himself
given
notice
to
quit
the
country
at
once
or
take
such
a
whipping
as
the
old
time
overseers
used
to
give
their
negroes
but
cæsar
next
words
reassured
him
although
they
did
not
lessen
his
astonishment
you
know
dem
yankees
what
runnin
loose
in
de
woods
he
said
in
a
low
tone
wal
sah
moster
ned
dem
um
we
hear
that
you
are
union
and
so
we
have
made
bold
to
come
here
and
ask
if
you
can
give
us
a
little
help
said
one
of
the
men
and
ned
noticed
that
he
did
not
speak
like
one
who
begged
a
favor
there
was
a
ring
of
defiance
in
his
tones
which
under
the
circumstances
was
perfectly
surprising
who
told
you
that
i
am
union
said
ned
at
length
the
darkeys
we
know
the
name
and
politics
of
every
man
between
here
and
the
place
where
we
were
captured
just
now
we
are
looking
for
supper
and
lodging
but
i
care
more
for
a
pair
of
shoes
than
i
do
for
eating
and
sleeping
although
i
am
so
tired
that
i
could
drop
down
where
i
stand
and
sleep
for
a
week
said
the
second
man
the
hounds
have
driven
us
hard
since
we
got
away
and
i
have
worn
out
all
the
footgear
i
could
get
or
steal
we
had
some
blankets
and
quilts
yesterday
added
his
companion
but
we
had
to
throw
them
away
this
morning
in
order
to
make
light
weight
through
the
thick
woods
we
would
have
been
in
rags
if
it
had
not
been
for
our
good
friends
the
darkeys
i
can
supply
your
wants
and
shall
be
glad
to
do
so
said
ned
promptly
but
you
must
never
mention
my
name
where
any
of
my
neighbors
can
hear
it
come
into
the
house
and
cæsar
will
stand
outside
to
see
that
no
one
slips
up
on
you
there
ought
to
be
four
of
you
where
are
the
other
two
we
left
them
in
the
woods
at
the
end
of
the
lane
keeping
guard
over
a
prize
we
gobbled
this
afternoon
replied
one
of
the
and
when
they
were
conducted
into
the
room
in
which
griffin
was
sitting
they
removed
their
remnants
of
hats
respectfully
and
dropped
with
something
like
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
into
the
chairs
that
ned
pulled
up
for
them
but
they
held
fast
to
their
guns
it
took
but
a
minute
time
for
ned
to
explain
the
situation
to
his
mother
and
scarcely
longer
to
provide
for
the
immediate
wants
of
the
two
fugitives
for
when
griffin
said
that
they
were
welcome
to
everything
there
was
in
the
house
the
half
a
dozen
black
heads
that
filled
one
of
the
doors
were
quickly
withdrawn
and
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
it
a
plate
filled
with
cold
bread
and
meat
was
handed
to
each
of
the
hungry
mighty
sorry
i
aint
got
some
store
coffee
for
you
honey
said
one
of
the
women
who
by
virtue
of
her
age
and
position
took
it
upon
herself
to
act
as
mistress
of
ceremonies
but
i
is
got
none
we
sorry
for
that
aunty
not
on
our
account
but
on
yours
said
one
of
the
soldiers
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you
white
folks
ought
to
be
able
to
get
such
things
as
coffee
out
here
there
was
lots
of
trading
going
on
with
country
people
when
we
left
baton
rouge
we
had
a
few
things
through
the
kindness
of
my
employer
replied
ned
and
we
hope
to
have
more
when
i
get
a
permit
to
trade
myself
gray
thought
it
was
best
to
trouble
the
provost
marshal
for
too
many
permits
for
fear
that
he
would
shut
down
on
all
of
them
well
the
marshal
will
not
shut
down
on
you
nor
on
any
other
union
man
whose
name
we
have
on
our
list
said
the
soldier
confidently
we
are
not
going
to
forget
our
friends
i
assure
you
and
then
he
almost
made
ned
jump
out
of
his
chair
by
adding
you
spoke
gray
name
just
now
i
suppose
he
is
rodney
father
is
he
yes
he
is
cried
ned
but
what
do
you
know
about
him
not
much
that
a
fact
but
we
met
rodney
once
when
he
was
at
all
glad
to
see
us
if
we
had
been
a
different
lot
we
might
have
put
him
and
his
comrade
to
some
trouble
just
to
show
what
vigilant
scouts
we
were
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
belonged
to
the
squad
that
captured
rodney
and
dick
graham
a
few
days
ago
we
two
of
them
and
the
others
are
in
the
woods
if
our
pursuers
have
found
and
gobbled
them
up
but
i
do
think
they
have
or
we
have
heard
the
sounds
of
the
fight
well
you
not
go
away
without
seeing
rodney
and
dick
will
you
that
depends
answered
the
soldier
with
a
smile
we
are
not
on
a
pleasure
trip
and
ca
say
beforehand
just
what
we
will
do
the
first
thing
for
us
to
find
out
in
the
morning
is
whether
or
not
our
pursuers
have
placed
themselves
between
us
and
the
river
if
they
have
it
might
be
well
for
us
to
remain
in
hiding
a
few
hours
and
give
them
time
to
get
out
of
our
road
but
if
they
are
still
behind
us
we
ought
to
push
on
without
loss
of
time
i
do
suppose
those
two
rebs
would
go
back
on
us
if
they
knew
where
we
were
they
said
they
would
rodney
and
dick
exclaimed
ned
indignantly
while
they
were
in
the
army
they
fought
you
yanks
the
best
they
knew
how
but
i
know
what
i
am
talking
about
when
i
say
that
you
have
better
friends
in
your
regiment
or
company
than
rodney
gray
and
dick
graham
i
believe
it
said
the
soldier
earnestly
we
are
not
afraid
to
trust
any
man
who
met
us
in
open
battle
but
the
home
guards
we
afraid
of
you
better
be
exclaimed
ned
the
most
of
them
are
sneaks
and
cowards
and
disgrace
the
uniform
they
wear
i
believe
that
too
and
now
let
me
tell
you
why
we
are
afraid
of
them
when
we
met
your
two
friends
gray
and
graham
we
belonged
to
a
squad
of
twenty
men
who
were
under
orders
to
scour
the
country
between
the
river
and
camp
pinckney
so
that
we
could
give
timely
notice
to
general
williams
if
we
discovered
any
considerable
body
of
confederates
in
that
direction
the
general
has
information
that
the
enemy
is
going
to
try
to
open
the
river
again
and
of
course
he
means
to
be
ready
for
any
rebs
who
come
this
way
after
we
told
rodney
and
his
chum
to
go
home
and
see
their
mammies
we
rejoined
our
command
which
we
found
about
three
miles
down
the
road
and
reported
that
we
had
seen
any
graybacks
and
no
signs
of
any
and
the
very
next
day
we
were
surprised
and
routed
by
a
mixed
body
of
veterans
and
home
guards
which
some
good
rebel
had
put
on
our
track
we
gave
them
a
lively
fight
but
they
were
too
many
for
us
and
those
of
us
who
were
not
killed
or
captured
were
scattered
far
and
wide
i
had
much
of
an
idea
of
being
taken
prisoner
i
tell
you
and
i
have
still
less
now
i
rather
be
shot
and
have
done
with
it
i
had
talked
with
some
of
our
boys
who
had
had
experience
as
captives
and
the
stories
they
told
were
enough
to
make
one
hair
rise
on
end
they
did
not
have
a
word
of
fault
to
find
with
the
rebel
soldiers
who
so
they
said
always
treated
them
well
but
they
gave
it
to
the
home
guards
good
and
strong
and
declared
that
in
future
they
would
shoot
every
one
that
crossed
their
path
i
could
easily
tell
the
home
guards
from
the
soldiers
in
that
fight
both
by
their
dress
and
the
way
they
behaved
under
fire
and
when
i
saw
one
of
our
boys
killed
after
he
had
given
up
his
gun
and
saw
that
there
was
no
possible
chance
for
me
to
get
away
i
just
avenged
the
death
of
my
comrade
by
tumbling
that
home
guard
out
of
his
saddle
with
the
last
cartridge
i
had
and
hunted
up
an
old
soldier
and
surrendered
to
him
my
three
comrades
did
the
same
and
that
the
way
we
happen
to
be
alive
we
were
kept
with
the
main
body
about
two
hours
and
during
that
time
were
used
like
white
men
the
veterans
divided
their
grub
with
us
patted
us
on
the
back
and
said
we
were
good
fellows
for
driving
them
out
of
corinth
and
licking
them
on
the
river
as
we
had
been
doing
and
we
had
nothing
in
the
world
to
complain
of
but
i
tell
you
we
shook
in
our
shoes
when
we
learned
that
nine
of
us
prisoners
were
to
be
sent
to
camp
pinckney
under
a
strong
escort
of
home
guards
while
the
soldiers
kept
to
the
road
to
hunt
for
more
yankees
and
right
there
is
where
i
blame
the
officer
in
command
of
the
confederate
detachment
said
the
now
beginning
to
show
such
signs
of
anger
and
excitement
that
ned
griffin
would
have
been
alarmed
if
he
had
known
that
his
loyalty
to
the
flag
was
beyond
suspicion
and
if
he
ever
falls
into
the
hands
of
my
regiment
he
will
have
cause
to
regret
that
act
of
his
he
knew
what
manner
of
men
his
home
guards
they
were
as
you
say
sneaks
and
cowards
that
they
dared
not
go
to
the
front
and
that
their
highest
ambition
was
to
shoot
a
yankee
without
running
the
risk
of
being
shot
themselves
but
he
told
us
to
go
and
when
the
order
was
given
for
us
to
fall
in
we
had
to
obey
it
well
sir
you
may
believe
it
or
not
but
i
can
prove
it
we
had
much
more
than
got
out
of
sight
of
the
soldiers
before
those
home
guards
began
laughing
and
joking
about
losing
us
on
their
way
to
camp
did
they
think
you
were
going
to
try
to
escape
asked
ned
they
meant
that
they
were
going
to
shoot
us
said
the
man
fiercely
ned
and
his
mother
could
hardly
believe
that
their
ears
were
not
deceiving
them
thank
goodness
our
home
guards
are
not
as
bad
as
that
said
the
former
have
they
ever
been
put
to
the
test
demanded
the
fugitive
i
know
that
they
have
fought
gunboats
and
defeated
some
detachments
of
our
cavalry
but
did
they
ever
have
a
yankee
prisoner
in
their
hands
ned
was
greatly
astonished
to
hear
that
the
mooreville
home
guards
had
been
in
action
with
the
federal
cavalry
but
he
managed
to
say
that
he
did
think
they
had
ever
taken
a
prisoner
before
he
could
say
more
the
continued
i
should
like
to
fall
into
their
power
for
i
believe
they
would
make
short
work
of
me
the
men
who
had
been
detailed
to
take
us
nine
prisoners
to
camp
came
from
the
pearl
river
bottoms
and
looked
acted
and
talked
more
like
heathen
than
any
men
i
ever
saw
before
believing
that
we
did
not
understand
their
jokes
about
losing
us
in
the
woods
they
talked
freely
among
themselves
until
we
came
to
a
place
where
the
road
forked
and
there
they
separated
into
two
parties
four
of
their
number
taking
my
three
comrades
and
myself
down
one
road
while
the
rest
of
the
escort
went
with
the
other
five
prisoners
down
the
other
road
before
this
happened
i
had
made
up
my
mind
that
i
was
going
to
be
killed
by
those
yahoos
if
i
could
help
it
and
that
act
of
separation
was
two
points
in
favor
of
the
plans
i
had
formed
in
my
mind
it
gave
me
as
companions
three
men
who
enlisted
at
the
same
time
i
did
who
had
served
in
my
company
and
regiment
all
through
the
war
and
who
i
knew
could
be
depended
on
to
back
me
up
in
anything
i
undertook
and
it
gave
us
four
the
smallest
escort
the
main
body
having
gone
down
the
other
road
with
the
rest
of
the
prisoners
and
i
hope
and
believe
that
those
five
fellows
got
safely
into
camp
for
the
men
who
went
with
them
were
not
half
as
villainous
or
as
those
who
guarded
us
to
show
you
what
sort
of
men
we
had
to
deal
with
one
of
them
remarked
as
he
drew
a
big
knife
from
his
boot
to
cut
off
a
chew
of
tobacco
that
he
would
think
any
more
of
sticking
that
knife
into
a
yank
than
he
would
of
putting
it
into
a
pig
i
have
been
in
some
tight
places
since
i
joined
the
service
but
i
do
think
i
ever
suffered
as
i
did
during
the
next
fifteen
minutes
it
makes
me
sweat
now
to
think
of
it
continued
the
veteran
and
as
he
spoke
he
drew
his
crooked
finger
across
his
forehead
and
threw
off
the
perspiration
which
ned
saw
had
gathered
there
like
big
drops
of
rain
being
the
only
officer
there
was
in
our
was
corporal
you
fellows
naturally
looked
to
me
to
do
something
and
i
was
fully
aware
of
it
for
i
knew
then
as
well
as
i
do
now
that
they
had
one
and
all
determined
to
escape
from
those
home
guards
or
die
in
the
attempt
i
communicated
with
each
of
them
by
making
the
best
use
of
my
eyes
i
knew
how
and
could
have
yelled
with
delight
when
i
saw
that
i
made
them
understand
me
each
of
us
selected
a
rebel
and
kept
as
close
to
him
as
he
could
without
exciting
suspicion
i
was
impatient
to
get
to
work
for
i
did
know
how
soon
they
would
begin
work
on
us
but
i
was
afraid
to
do
anything
until
i
thought
we
were
well
out
of
hearing
of
the
party
that
had
taken
the
other
road
i
was
certain
that
there
would
be
some
shooting
done
during
the
fight
and
did
not
want
to
draw
their
attention
but
when
i
could
stand
it
no
longer
i
gave
a
yell
and
floored
my
man
as
easily
as
you
would
pitch
a
bundle
of
oats
on
to
a
wagon
i
had
him
out
of
his
saddle
before
he
could
wink
and
grabbed
his
carbine
just
in
time
to
help
ben
here
who
was
having
as
good
luck
as
i
did
you
kill
both
of
them
inquired
ned
who
was
so
deeply
interested
in
the
narrative
that
he
did
not
know
whether
he
breathed
or
not
we
laid
them
out
replied
the
veteran
and
as
we
were
in
something
of
a
hurry
we
did
wait
to
see
how
long
it
took
them
to
come
to
it
was
all
over
in
less
than
i
have
taken
time
to
tell
it
and
there
was
a
shot
fired
or
another
yell
raised
the
fight
was
carried
on
so
quietly
that
a
person
standing
fifty
feet
away
would
not
have
heard
it
we
did
not
waste
any
precious
moments
in
congratulating
one
another
on
our
good
fortune
but
carried
the
bodies
of
our
guards
into
the
woods
out
of
sight
dragged
some
brush
over
one
or
two
little
pools
of
blood
there
were
in
the
road
and
over
our
footprints
thus
concealing
all
traces
of
the
struggle
as
best
we
could
and
hitched
the
four
horses
among
the
trees
where
they
would
have
plenty
of
leaves
and
twigs
to
browse
on
until
they
were
released
and
then
we
struck
out
for
the
bottom
the
best
we
knew
how
whew
you
have
had
a
time
of
it
said
ned
as
the
corporal
settled
back
in
his
chair
clasped
his
hands
over
his
knee
and
looked
at
his
empty
plate
lucindy
bring
some
more
grub
and
pile
on
all
the
plates
will
hold
when
did
you
first
become
aware
that
the
dogs
were
on
your
trail
we
found
it
out
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
was
the
reply
or
rather
that
was
the
time
we
learned
that
the
rebs
were
going
to
use
hounds
to
follow
us
up
we
slept
in
the
woods
that
night
without
a
fire
or
a
bite
to
eat
and
at
daylight
set
out
to
find
a
negro
cabin
for
we
knew
that
the
darkeys
would
befriend
us
if
they
could
do
so
without
bringing
themselves
into
trouble
we
came
to
a
plantation
after
a
while
and
crept
close
enough
to
the
quarter
to
discover
a
negro
working
about
one
of
the
we
attracted
his
attention
without
much
trouble
but
as
soon
as
he
made
out
who
we
were
he
disappeared
so
suddenly
that
we
were
sorry
we
did
not
shoot
him
on
sight
for
we
were
certain
that
he
meant
to
betray
us
so
we
made
a
little
detour
and
took
up
another
position
in
the
field
from
which
we
could
watch
the
doors
of
the
great
house
for
there
was
where
we
knew
danger
would
come
from
if
it
came
at
all
by
that
move
we
came
near
losing
a
breakfast
and
missing
some
information
that
was
of
use
to
us
for
that
darkey
had
no
intention
of
going
back
on
us
he
slipped
around
to
his
cabin
gathered
up
everything
he
had
in
the
way
of
grub
and
spent
many
valuable
minutes
in
hunting
us
up
he
had
a
story
to
tell
us
but
was
so
badly
frightened
that
it
was
a
long
time
before
he
could
make
us
understand
that
the
news
of
our
escape
had
reached
camp
pinckney
that
all
the
soldiers
and
home
guards
that
could
be
spared
from
duty
there
had
been
sent
in
pursuit
of
us
and
that
a
big
squad
of
men
had
passed
the
house
before
daylight
that
morning
vowing
that
they
would
never
take
us
prisoners
if
they
found
us
they
would
shoot
us
in
our
tracks
to
pay
us
for
what
we
had
done
to
their
comrades
back
there
in
the
road
then
they
were
home
guards
ned
interposed
certainly
and
that
threat
proved
it
but
that
was
not
by
any
means
the
worst
news
the
darkey
had
to
tell
us
continued
the
corporal
placing
his
gun
on
the
floor
by
his
side
and
nodding
to
lucindy
as
she
handed
him
a
second
plateful
of
bread
and
meat
and
the
part
he
had
yet
told
was
what
frightened
him
after
much
questioning
he
made
us
understand
that
there
were
six
soldiers
in
the
great
house
waiting
for
the
breakfast
that
the
missus
had
promised
them
and
when
they
had
eaten
it
they
were
going
down
the
road
about
half
a
mile
after
a
pack
of
nigger
dogs
that
were
to
be
put
on
our
trail
and
then
he
assured
us
that
if
those
dogs
ever
got
after
us
we
would
be
gone
up
sure
for
they
were
smart
at
following
a
trail
having
had
lots
of
practice
in
running
down
the
unhappy
conscripts
who
escaped
from
camp
pinckney
that
was
bad
news
for
us
as
i
said
and
the
question
at
once
arose
should
we
take
to
our
heels
and
trust
to
luck
or
would
it
be
a
better
plan
to
rush
into
the
house
and
put
it
out
of
the
power
of
the
rebels
to
go
after
those
dogs
but
were
you
not
afraid
to
attack
them
in
the
house
exclaimed
ned
there
were
six
of
them
and
only
four
of
you
a
small
difference
in
numbers
to
men
who
are
working
for
life
and
liberty
answered
the
corporal
we
talked
the
matter
over
very
quickly
and
decided
without
a
dissenting
voice
that
we
would
put
a
stop
to
that
hound
business
before
it
had
gone
any
further
we
would
take
our
chances
on
surprising
the
rebels
while
they
were
at
breakfast
and
be
governed
by
circumstances
when
we
found
who
and
what
they
were
if
they
were
regular
soldiers
we
would
simply
parole
them
and
let
them
go
but
if
they
turned
out
to
be
home
the
fugitive
did
not
finish
the
sentence
but
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
looked
at
ned
and
his
mother
in
a
way
that
had
a
volume
of
meaning
in
it
it
did
not
take
us
many
seconds
to
determine
upon
a
plan
of
operations
he
continued
and
then
we
crept
toward
the
house
under
cover
of
the
bushes
and
out
buildings
telling
our
friendly
darkey
to
stay
where
he
was
till
the
trouble
was
over
and
no
one
should
ever
hear
from
us
that
we
had
exchanged
a
word
with
him
everything
was
in
our
favor
there
was
a
servant
outside
the
house
to
run
in
and
warn
the
inmates
that
we
were
coming
and
before
those
six
johnnies
knew
that
there
was
a
yank
within
miles
we
were
in
the
breakfast
room
where
they
sat
at
the
table
and
had
them
covered
and
what
did
they
turn
out
to
be
ned
almost
gasped
regular
soldiers
i
am
glad
to
say
and
we
were
saved
a
most
disagreeable
piece
of
business
we
told
them
they
were
in
a
trap
and
could
take
their
choice
between
going
to
the
and
signing
a
parole
not
to
take
up
arms
against
the
government
again
until
they
were
regularly
exchanged
and
they
thought
they
had
better
sign
and
it
did
take
them
a
great
while
to
say
so
either
had
you
any
right
to
do
that
inquired
griffin
not
the
least
in
the
world
madam
replied
the
corporal
with
a
smile
but
as
long
as
the
rebels
did
know
it
what
was
the
odds
we
could
take
them
with
us
we
could
shoot
them
seeing
that
they
were
not
home
guards
and
yet
we
had
to
do
something
all
we
really
hoped
to
accomplish
was
to
frighten
them
off
our
trail
long
enough
to
give
us
a
good
start
toward
the
swamp
we
knew
their
officers
would
tell
them
that
their
parole
did
amount
to
a
row
of
pins
but
by
the
time
they
found
their
officers
we
might
be
miles
away
there
was
one
thing
we
were
sorry
for
and
that
was
that
they
did
not
have
their
dogs
in
the
house
with
them
they
would
have
followed
any
more
escaped
prisoners
when
we
got
through
with
them
i
assure
you
chapter
xii
a
hail
at
the
bars
although
the
corporal
talked
rapidly
he
did
not
neglect
his
supper
and
by
the
time
he
reached
this
point
in
his
story
his
second
supply
of
bread
and
meat
was
all
gone
he
handed
back
the
empty
plate
rested
his
gun
across
his
knees
where
it
would
be
handy
in
case
of
emergency
and
drew
from
one
of
the
pockets
of
his
ragged
blouse
something
that
looked
like
a
small
bundle
of
brown
wrapping
paper
yes
they
concluded
they
better
sign
said
he
with
a
laugh
and
here
are
their
paroles
at
first
the
lady
of
the
house
who
was
disposed
to
be
impudent
and
sassy
until
one
of
the
rebs
cautioned
her
that
it
might
be
worse
for
them
if
she
did
keep
still
declared
that
she
had
nothing
at
all
in
the
way
of
writing
materials
but
when
one
of
the
johnnies
told
her
with
some
impatience
that
if
she
hand
them
out
we
be
likely
to
go
through
her
shanty
she
produced
the
stump
of
a
pencil
and
some
paper
that
was
so
rough
i
could
scarcely
write
on
it
but
i
made
it
do
and
would
you
believe
it
one
of
my
boys
had
to
witness
their
signatures
for
there
was
one
of
the
six
rebels
who
could
write
his
name
of
course
we
disarmed
and
dismounted
them
and
stood
among
the
bushes
in
the
front
yard
and
saw
them
make
tracks
in
the
direction
of
camp
pinckney
but
the
hounds
were
put
on
our
trail
all
the
same
and
the
next
day
they
pressed
us
so
close
that
we
had
to
shoot
some
of
the
leading
ones
and
what
surprised
us
was
that
those
dogs
would
not
attempt
to
follow
our
trail
across
a
piece
of
wet
ground
they
would
take
a
circle
around
it
and
pick
up
our
trail
again
on
the
other
side
where
the
ground
was
dry
they
do
it
every
time
said
ned
and
it
is
a
part
of
their
training
either
that
the
way
they
hunt
deer
and
foxes
and
it
is
something
they
pick
up
themselves
without
any
teaching
well
it
pretty
bright
in
the
dogs
i
must
say
and
we
were
sorry
to
shoot
them
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
first
and
last
we
must
have
killed
half
or
of
the
pack
but
they
have
been
strongly
reinforced
for
judging
by
the
yelping
we
heard
there
are
more
hounds
on
our
trail
now
than
there
were
at
the
start
you
were
very
fortunate
in
being
able
to
keep
out
of
their
way
said
griffin
and
i
do
see
how
you
managed
it
i
do
either
madam
but
somehow
we
did
it
we
ca
keep
it
up
much
longer
however
for
we
are
nearly
exhausted
and
i
wish
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
that
we
were
in
sight
of
those
gunboats
at
this
minute
but
we
get
there
in
due
time
and
we
not
go
we
made
an
important
capture
this
afternoon
and
perhaps
have
saved
our
scouts
and
gunboats
as
well
as
the
union
people
in
the
settlement
some
trouble
it
a
fortunate
thing
for
him
that
we
did
know
what
he
was
when
we
first
caught
sight
of
him
but
as
he
was
in
full
uniform
we
supposed
he
was
a
soldier
and
treated
him
accordingly
what
was
he
faltered
ned
while
his
mother
looked
anxious
and
bent
forward
in
her
chair
to
catch
the
corporal
answer
something
told
them
that
they
were
about
to
hear
bad
news
a
miserable
home
guard
and
a
captain
besides
replied
the
soldier
of
course
after
he
surrendered
we
could
shoot
him
down
in
cold
blood
as
his
kind
would
have
served
us
if
we
had
chanced
to
fall
into
their
power
but
we
put
him
where
he
not
fight
any
more
gunboats
for
one
while
i
bet
you
how
and
where
did
you
capture
him
was
ned
next
question
it
the
one
that
trembled
on
his
tongue
but
it
was
as
near
as
he
could
get
to
it
why
we
had
been
wading
for
two
miles
in
a
little
bayou
that
brought
us
through
a
cornfield
to
the
river
side
of
the
road
and
at
last
we
hid
in
a
grove
of
evergreens
from
which
we
could
command
a
view
in
all
directions
we
stayed
there
for
an
hour
listening
to
the
faint
baying
of
the
hounds
in
the
timber
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
and
never
once
dreaming
that
anybody
would
come
near
us
when
to
our
surprise
we
saw
a
gate
open
and
a
single
horseman
ride
down
the
lane
that
led
straight
to
our
place
of
concealment
i
tell
you
we
were
scared
for
we
expected
to
see
the
dogs
and
all
our
pursuers
come
through
the
gate
after
him
but
he
stopped
to
put
up
the
bars
and
then
came
on
alone
and
when
he
approached
nearer
we
saw
that
he
could
not
be
one
of
the
men
we
were
looking
for
because
his
horse
was
fresh
and
clean
and
did
have
the
splashed
legs
and
body
he
would
if
he
had
been
chasing
us
through
the
swamp
for
three
days
and
more
we
saw
too
that
he
and
his
horse
were
at
outs
about
something
for
every
once
in
a
while
he
would
pound
the
animal
with
his
whip
as
if
he
were
very
mad
at
him
and
the
last
time
he
tried
it
which
he
did
when
he
was
within
less
than
a
hundred
feet
of
our
the
horse
jumped
and
threw
him
as
slick
as
you
please
and
i
was
glad
of
it
that
was
the
time
we
rushed
out
and
took
him
in
did
he
tell
you
his
name
inquired
ned
and
the
words
seemed
to
force
themselves
out
against
his
will
yes
he
did
and
we
think
it
strange
that
general
williams
abolished
him
and
put
a
stop
to
his
doings
long
ago
but
none
of
us
ever
heard
the
name
of
captain
randolph
before
you
know
him
i
suppose
certainly
i
do
and
i
know
that
so
far
as
fighting
is
concerned
he
is
the
most
harmless
man
in
the
country
did
he
tell
you
that
his
company
had
defeated
some
of
your
cavalry
and
been
in
action
with
the
gunboats
he
certainly
did
tell
us
just
that
replied
the
corporal
and
ned
and
his
mother
thought
he
looked
at
them
rather
sharply
well
there
was
a
word
of
truth
in
it
said
the
young
overseer
stoutly
he
began
to
have
a
vague
idea
that
he
was
injuring
himself
in
the
estimation
of
these
two
federals
by
standing
up
for
tom
randolph
but
he
had
gone
too
far
to
back
out
he
knew
that
tom
would
not
have
uttered
a
word
in
his
defence
if
their
situations
had
been
reversed
but
that
made
no
difference
to
ned
griffin
who
in
few
words
gave
the
corporal
a
full
history
of
tom
military
exploits
the
occasional
raids
through
the
settlement
that
captain
randolph
had
made
at
the
head
of
his
company
ned
did
not
regard
as
military
business
for
their
sole
purpose
was
to
intimidate
union
men
and
increase
tom
importance
so
he
said
nothing
about
them
if
you
are
as
strongly
in
favor
of
the
old
flag
as
i
have
been
led
to
believe
i
do
see
what
your
object
is
in
saying
a
good
word
for
this
home
guard
said
the
corporal
when
ned
ceased
speaking
would
you
say
a
word
for
an
old
acquaintance
of
yours
if
you
saw
him
in
trouble
no
matter
whether
he
was
your
friend
or
not
asked
ned
in
reply
if
you
will
give
me
time
i
can
prove
that
i
have
told
you
nothing
but
the
truth
and
that
tom
has
deceived
you
from
beginning
to
end
what
do
you
suppose
his
object
was
in
doing
it
he
always
does
it
every
chance
he
gets
he
knows
he
will
never
win
a
reputation
by
deeds
of
arms
and
so
he
tries
to
win
it
with
his
mouth
he
never
did
you
yankees
the
least
harm
and
he
never
will
do
you
think
we
have
been
here
long
enough
charley
ben
asked
of
his
officer
and
he
answered
the
question
himself
by
getting
upon
his
feet
as
if
he
were
making
ready
to
leave
he
was
plainly
the
more
suspicious
of
the
two
and
showed
in
various
ways
that
he
did
have
much
of
an
opinion
of
one
who
had
so
friendly
a
feeling
for
a
home
guard
we
been
here
too
long
replied
the
corporal
our
friends
down
there
in
the
woods
will
think
we
are
lost
or
have
been
gobbled
up
may
we
trespass
still
further
on
your
by
asking
for
a
bite
for
our
absent
comrades
lucindy
fill
up
the
biggest
basket
you
can
find
in
the
house
said
ned
and
ben
if
you
will
sit
down
a
minute
i
will
get
shoes
and
stockings
for
you
and
have
you
anything
in
the
way
of
bedding
inquired
griffin
the
nights
are
cool
if
the
days
are
sultry
no
they
did
have
a
thing
except
their
guns
and
the
dilapidated
garments
they
stood
in
and
a
blanket
or
two
if
griffin
could
spare
them
would
protect
them
from
the
mosquitos
if
nothing
more
for
of
course
it
would
be
dangerous
for
them
to
build
a
smudge
until
they
knew
positively
that
their
pursuers
had
been
left
behind
ben
was
profuse
in
his
thanks
and
suggested
that
no
would
be
about
the
right
size
for
him
and
ned
went
among
the
darkeys
to
find
them
for
he
wore
nothing
larger
than
and
could
boast
of
an
extra
pair
of
them
while
he
was
gone
his
mother
saw
the
basket
filled
and
the
blankets
made
into
a
bundle
and
also
found
opportunity
to
say
a
word
for
tom
randolph
what
do
you
intend
to
do
with
him
she
asked
turn
him
over
to
the
provost
marshal
and
have
him
sent
north
was
the
answer
if
you
do
that
you
will
kill
his
mother
and
punish
a
man
who
is
as
innocent
of
any
military
achievements
as
i
am
said
griffin
you
must
not
think
that
i
am
a
friend
of
can
i
be
when
he
tried
his
best
to
have
my
son
conscripted
why
can
you
not
parole
him
and
let
him
go
we
did
parole
those
six
rebels
for
fun
or
because
we
thought
the
parole
was
binding
said
the
corporal
with
a
smile
but
simply
to
delay
them
until
we
could
get
a
start
if
we
turn
randolph
loose
it
will
be
out
of
gratitude
to
you
and
your
son
better
knock
him
in
the
head
growled
ben
do
mind
him
said
the
corporal
seeing
that
griffin
was
shocked
by
the
words
ben
is
down
on
all
home
guards
because
he
saw
one
of
them
shoot
his
chum
but
tom
randolph
was
in
no
way
to
blame
for
that
answered
the
lady
and
i
know
that
rodney
gray
would
insist
upon
his
release
if
he
were
here
promise
me
that
you
will
let
him
go
and
when
you
are
ready
to
start
for
the
river
ned
shall
take
you
there
by
the
shortest
and
easiest
course
the
corporal
opened
his
lips
to
reply
that
he
did
not
think
it
best
to
make
any
promises
until
he
could
consult
the
rest
of
his
party
but
before
he
could
utter
a
word
an
incident
happened
that
brought
him
and
ben
to
their
feet
in
a
twinkling
and
drove
all
the
color
from
griffin
face
leaving
it
as
white
as
a
sheet
first
there
was
a
terrific
and
sudden
outburst
of
yelps
and
growls
from
the
small
army
of
coon
dogs
that
found
a
home
on
the
plantation
and
then
answering
yelps
and
bays
came
from
the
direction
of
the
front
bars
mingled
with
the
shouts
of
command
and
the
sharp
cracking
of
there
was
a
second
oppressive
silence
and
a
strange
voice
called
out
the
house
coming
sir
get
out
you
whelps
shouted
ned
griffin
voice
in
reply
and
presently
the
frightened
inmates
of
the
house
heard
him
running
around
the
corner
toward
the
bars
the
corporal
and
his
comrade
who
stood
with
their
guns
in
readiness
seemingly
as
much
at
their
ease
as
they
had
been
while
sitting
quietly
in
their
chairs
eating
the
bread
and
meat
that
had
been
provided
for
them
looked
inquiringly
at
griffin
they
are
strangers
and
have
hounds
with
them
said
the
latter
in
a
terrified
whisper
i
fear
the
worst
but
ned
will
do
what
he
can
i
certainly
hope
he
will
keep
them
out
of
the
house
answered
the
corporal
calmly
for
if
he
do
some
of
them
will
never
see
the
sun
rise
again
ned
griffin
who
had
had
no
trouble
at
all
in
inducing
one
of
the
field
hands
to
hand
over
a
pair
of
stockings
and
his
best
shoes
for
the
benefit
of
the
soldier
in
the
house
was
almost
ready
to
drop
when
he
heard
that
racket
at
the
front
bars
but
he
answered
the
hail
without
an
instant
hesitation
tossing
the
stockings
and
shoes
into
the
nearest
bush
and
ran
to
the
road
knowing
that
he
would
meet
a
party
of
confederate
soldiers
and
a
pack
of
nigger
dogs
when
he
got
there
but
did
the
soldiers
know
or
suspect
that
the
men
of
whom
they
were
in
pursuit
had
sought
aid
and
comfort
in
that
house
they
ca
know
it
or
suspect
it
unless
somebody
has
betrayed
us
and
if
that
has
happened
it
is
all
up
with
ned
griffin
thought
the
young
overseer
and
when
he
reached
the
bars
and
caught
sight
of
the
party
on
the
other
side
he
did
not
feign
surprise
but
said
as
any
other
honest
hospitable
boy
would
have
done
alight
and
hitch
i
knew
it
was
you
the
minute
i
heard
the
music
of
your
hounds
did
you
catch
them
no
replied
one
of
the
men
who
wore
some
sort
of
insignia
on
his
collar
to
show
that
he
was
an
officer
they
gave
us
the
slip
about
eleven
this
morning
and
we
have
been
able
to
find
their
tracks
since
but
say
interrupted
ned
suddenly
please
do
let
your
big
hounds
come
over
the
fence
and
eat
up
my
pups
i
need
them
to
catch
wild
hogs
with
next
winter
that
was
very
true
but
it
was
not
the
reason
ned
did
not
want
the
hounds
to
come
inside
the
yard
he
was
afraid
that
some
of
them
might
go
foraging
on
their
own
hook
and
if
they
wandered
around
to
the
back
door
in
search
of
something
to
eat
they
could
not
help
striking
the
trail
the
two
escaped
prisoners
made
when
they
entered
the
house
they
would
be
sure
to
recognize
it
on
the
instant
and
give
tongue
and
then
there
would
be
trouble
indeed
for
ben
and
the
corporal
would
fight
till
they
dropped
before
they
would
be
recaptured
and
then
what
would
be
done
to
him
and
his
mother
for
feeding
and
trying
to
conceal
them
but
the
hounds
were
thrashed
and
scolded
back
into
the
road
and
the
officer
continued
we
will
get
the
start
of
them
if
they
are
in
this
neighborhood
they
will
stay
here
for
we
are
going
to
place
ourselves
between
them
and
the
river
but
we
were
well
fed
and
rested
at
a
house
three
miles
back
so
we
not
alight
thank
you
are
we
on
the
road
to
mooreville
that
what
i
called
you
out
for
keep
straight
ahead
and
you
ca
miss
it
said
ned
and
if
you
want
to
go
toward
the
mississippi
take
the
first
road
but
look
out
for
the
yanks
i
have
seen
any
of
their
critter
fellers
but
there
may
be
some
between
here
and
baton
rouge
if
we
run
on
to
them
before
we
know
it
it
will
be
our
fault
it
forward
trot
gallop
the
young
overseer
feeling
as
if
a
mountain
had
been
removed
from
his
shoulders
stood
leaning
on
the
bars
until
the
sound
of
the
feet
had
died
away
in
the
distance
and
then
he
settled
himself
into
a
comfortable
position
drew
a
long
breath
and
waited
fifteen
minutes
longer
in
order
to
make
sure
that
the
rebels
had
really
gone
on
toward
mooreville
while
he
was
waiting
cæsar
came
up
expecting
to
receive
a
good
scolding
and
perhaps
something
worse
for
neglect
of
duty
sho
you
live
marse
ned
i
watch
and
wait
wid
all
my
eyes
and
ears
and
dey
slip
along
de
road
and
up
to
de
bars
i
knowed
it
he
said
earnestly
you
know
ole
cæsar
aint
going
to
sleep
wid
two
yankees
in
de
house
and
rebels
all
around
that
all
right
i
was
out
of
doors
and
did
know
they
were
at
the
bars
until
they
hailed
now
stay
right
here
and
see
that
they
steal
a
march
on
us
if
you
hear
the
slightest
sound
down
the
road
mooreville
way
slip
into
the
house
and
let
me
know
it
ned
went
back
to
the
bushes
where
he
left
the
stockings
and
shoes
and
when
he
carried
them
into
the
house
he
found
no
one
there
except
his
mother
who
was
plying
her
needle
as
if
nothing
had
happened
the
two
fugitives
had
disappeared
and
there
was
not
a
darkey
to
be
seen
open
that
door
and
you
will
find
them
said
griffin
when
ned
stopped
and
looked
all
around
they
thought
they
would
rather
fight
it
out
downstairs
than
in
the
garret
for
they
would
have
a
better
chance
to
run
they
ca
go
any
farther
for
their
pursuers
are
riding
hard
to
get
between
them
and
the
river
and
may
send
the
hounds
into
the
woods
at
any
time
and
i
am
glad
of
it
whispered
ned
i
like
to
keep
them
until
i
can
go
for
rodney
perhaps
he
can
do
something
for
tom
randolph
why
mother
did
you
ever
hear
of
such
a
lunatic
if
he
gets
out
of
this
scrape
i
do
think
he
ever
let
his
tongue
bring
him
into
another
ned
pushed
open
the
door
and
the
two
escaped
prisoners
came
out
in
few
words
they
were
made
acquainted
with
the
result
of
the
interview
that
had
taken
place
at
the
bars
and
ned
and
his
mother
did
not
wonder
that
it
had
a
depressing
effect
upon
them
after
racing
through
the
almost
impassable
woods
and
swamps
until
they
were
ready
to
drop
with
fatigue
it
certainly
disheartening
to
know
that
the
enemy
had
come
so
close
to
them
when
they
imagined
themselves
safe
for
the
night
they
decided
that
they
had
better
return
to
their
companions
at
once
and
talk
the
situation
over
with
them
all
right
said
ned
i
will
go
with
you
for
i
want
to
see
what
tom
randolph
has
to
say
for
himself
if
you
will
take
my
advice
you
will
stay
pretty
close
about
this
plantation
until
you
have
seen
rodney
gray
he
can
do
more
for
you
than
almost
anybody
else
in
these
parts
and
if
you
get
into
trouble
you
find
it
so
the
blankets
and
the
basket
of
provisions
were
brought
from
the
room
in
which
they
had
been
hastily
concealed
and
the
fugitives
lingered
a
moment
to
shake
hands
with
griffin
and
tell
her
how
grateful
they
were
for
the
generous
treatment
they
had
received
at
her
hands
and
her
son
there
is
one
way
in
which
you
can
show
it
replied
ned
mother
and
that
is
by
releasing
your
prisoner
but
madam
we
have
no
right
to
do
it
said
ben
who
was
inclined
to
put
more
faith
in
tom
story
of
his
exploits
than
he
did
in
ned
it
was
natural
under
the
circumstances
for
him
to
believe
that
regard
for
the
truth
was
not
so
strong
as
his
desire
to
shield
an
old
acquaintance
we
are
bound
to
take
him
before
our
colonel
and
state
the
case
to
him
and
if
has
a
mind
to
let
him
all
right
have
you
the
same
right
to
release
tom
randolph
that
you
had
to
release
rodney
gray
and
his
friend
inquired
griffin
you
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
take
them
before
an
officer
perhaps
i
did
stretch
my
authority
just
a
little
said
the
corporal
coming
to
ben
assistance
but
almost
any
who
wanted
to
be
half
white
would
have
done
the
same
thing
rodney
and
graham
had
discharges
in
their
pockets
while
this
man
randolph
holds
a
commission
as
captain
of
home
guards
at
this
minute
but
we
tell
the
boys
what
you
have
done
for
us
griffin
and
let
them
decide
the
matter
i
hope
it
may
be
our
good
fortune
to
meet
again
under
pleasanter
circumstances
ned
led
the
way
from
the
house
and
along
the
lane
that
ran
through
the
negro
quarter
to
the
woods
in
which
the
corporal
two
comrades
and
their
prisoner
were
impatiently
awaiting
their
return
they
moved
silently
and
without
exchanging
a
word
above
a
whisper
but
the
inmates
of
the
cabins
seemed
to
be
on
the
watch
one
door
after
another
was
softly
opened
and
suppressed
voices
that
were
rendered
husky
by
emotion
cheered
them
with
such
expressions
as
lawd
bress
marse
linkum
sojer
boys
youse
boun
to
whop
de
rebels
honey
i
know
you
is
kase
ise
praying
for
you
free
times
a
day
like
in
de
lion
den
i
certainly
hope
you
not
get
into
any
trouble
through
what
you
have
done
for
us
said
ben
who
was
moved
in
spite
of
himself
by
these
expressions
of
sympathy
so
far
as
i
know
our
blacks
are
all
loyal
answered
ned
but
it
wo
do
to
trust
some
negroes
too
far
any
more
than
it
will
do
to
trust
some
white
people
and
when
we
are
in
the
presence
of
tom
randolph
i
wish
you
would
be
careful
not
he
stopped
suddenly
but
it
was
too
late
he
had
committed
himself
as
he
afterward
told
his
friend
rodney
he
came
near
ruining
everything
before
he
thought
what
he
was
doing
there
you
have
it
exclaimed
ben
angrily
why
do
you
try
to
befriend
that
man
randolph
when
you
dare
not
trust
him
for
fear
that
he
will
set
your
rebel
neighbors
against
you
he
shall
never
go
free
with
my
consent
and
that
is
a
word
with
a
bark
on
it
or
are
you
afraid
that
he
will
get
his
home
guards
together
and
burn
you
out
to
pay
you
for
what
you
have
done
for
us
yankees
said
the
corporal
i
do
believe
there
a
home
guard
in
the
world
that
will
do
to
tie
to
and
i
think
the
best
thing
we
can
do
is
to
hold
fast
to
that
fellow
if
he
done
us
half
the
damage
he
says
he
has
he
is
a
prize
ned
common
sense
told
him
that
words
would
not
rectify
the
big
mistake
he
had
made
so
he
dropped
tom
randolph
entirely
and
talked
of
the
hounds
and
the
risk
his
yankee
friends
would
incur
if
they
tried
to
make
their
way
to
the
mississippi
through
the
comparatively
open
country
that
lay
before
them
there
were
not
woods
enough
to
conceal
their
movements
the
people
along
the
route
were
mostly
rebels
and
they
could
hardly
help
meeting
someone
who
would
put
their
pursuers
on
their
track
if
he
saw
half
a
chance
what
they
needed
more
than
anything
else
during
the
rest
of
their
journey
was
a
guide
known
to
be
a
good
confederate
but
friendly
enough
to
yanks
to
help
them
out
of
trouble
if
they
got
into
it
the
two
fugitives
did
not
think
they
were
likely
to
fall
into
such
trouble
as
ned
hinted
at
but
the
next
day
they
were
obliged
to
confess
that
he
knew
what
he
was
talking
about
by
this
time
they
had
reached
the
fence
that
ran
across
the
end
of
the
lane
and
shut
it
off
from
the
woods
and
there
ben
and
the
corporal
stopped
as
if
expecting
something
it
came
presently
in
the
shape
of
the
challenge
given
in
low
tones
comes
there
friends
with
the
countersign
replied
the
corporal
halt
friends
advance
one
with
the
countersign
and
have
your
head
blown
off
if
you
do
give
it
right
continued
the
voice
and
although
the
words
seemed
to
be
spoken
in
a
jest
ben
and
ned
remained
by
the
fence
while
the
corporal
climbed
over
it
and
disappeared
in
the
bushes
a
moment
afterward
he
called
to
them
to
come
on
and
when
ned
joined
him
he
knew
that
he
was
in
the
presence
of
the
other
two
fugitives
and
tom
randolph
it
was
made
plain
to
him
at
once
that
tom
had
sent
the
corporal
and
his
comrade
to
the
house
with
the
assurance
that
they
would
find
union
people
there
and
plenty
to
eat
for
tom
said
did
you
find
griffin
they
not
only
found
me
but
brought
me
here
to
see
you
said
ned
answering
for
himself
and
working
his
way
slowly
through
the
dark
in
the
direction
from
which
tom
voice
came
and
i
am
sorry
to
find
you
in
this
fix
captain
randolph
may
have
borne
up
bravely
enough
while
he
was
alone
with
his
captors
but
the
sound
of
a
familiar
voice
and
the
warm
grasp
of
ned
hand
unnerved
him
completely
he
drew
the
young
overseer
to
a
seat
on
a
log
beside
him
rested
his
head
against
his
shoulder
and
shook
as
if
he
had
the
ague
but
whether
it
was
with
fear
or
with
the
violence
of
the
struggle
he
was
making
to
keep
up
the
character
he
had
so
foolishly
assumed
ned
could
not
tell
there
had
been
a
time
when
tom
randolph
would
have
been
ashamed
to
rest
his
head
against
an
overseer
shoulder
but
he
was
pretty
well
humbled
now
it
was
at
this
juncture
that
ned
was
allowed
a
few
minutes
talk
with
tom
the
soldiers
being
busy
with
their
own
of
them
in
describing
what
had
happened
at
the
house
and
the
others
in
disposing
of
the
contents
of
the
provision
basket
tom
said
ned
you
never
told
these
yankees
that
you
had
whipped
their
cavalry
and
fought
the
gunboats
yes
i
did
answered
the
captive
and
the
overseer
was
not
much
surprised
to
notice
that
his
voice
was
choked
with
sobs
i
took
them
for
brave
men
and
thought
they
would
extend
a
brave
man
treatment
to
me
if
they
knew
me
to
be
a
loyal
soldier
of
the
confederacy
well
do
you
know
that
you
have
got
yourself
in
a
scrape
that
may
end
in
your
being
sent
to
a
northern
prison
oh
do
tell
me
that
gasped
tom
that
what
they
have
been
threatening
me
with
and
you
must
make
them
let
me
go
you
can
do
it
for
you
are
known
to
be
union
and
my
father
will
reward
you
and
you
are
not
a
loyal
soldier
of
the
confederacy
continued
ned
who
was
befriending
tom
in
the
hope
of
making
anything
out
of
it
you
are
nothing
but
a
home
guard
and
these
men
have
reason
to
hate
home
guards
i
know
it
groaned
tom
but
am
i
to
blame
for
anything
those
pearl
river
heathen
did
to
them
you
are
my
only
hope
ned
and
you
have
to
get
me
out
of
this
you
must
there
no
must
about
it
i
have
said
everything
i
could
and
so
has
mother
your
only
hope
is
rodney
gray
then
send
for
him
said
tom
nervously
send
for
him
at
once
and
say
that
if
he
will
stand
by
me
now
he
can
command
me
and
my
father
ever
afterward
i
wish
the
men
who
are
responsible
for
this
war
were
here
in
my
place
and
sentenced
to
be
shot
at
sunrise
i
have
been
deceived
and
badgered
ever
since
i
sided
with
the
confederacy
i
stuck
by
her
through
thick
and
thin
while
those
who
deserted
her
at
the
first
sign
of
disaster
are
well
met
with
the
yanks
in
baton
rouge
and
live
on
the
best
the
land
affords
they
have
salt
and
tea
and
coffee
in
their
houses
and
white
flour
and
we
have
none
you
must
help
me
out
ned
tom
randolph
continued
to
talk
in
this
rambling
way
until
the
corporal
interrupted
him
with
well
boys
we
have
decided
to
stay
here
and
will
you
let
griffin
go
for
rodney
gray
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
exclaimed
tom
griffin
is
a
prisoner
and
can
go
and
come
as
he
likes
replied
the
officer
indifferently
it
a
matter
that
concerns
you
more
than
it
does
us
if
griffin
has
a
mind
to
go
or
send
for
rodney
gray
we
shall
be
glad
to
see
him
these
are
the
yanks
who
captured
rodney
and
graham
while
they
were
on
their
way
home
whispered
ned
that
why
i
say
that
rodney
can
help
you
if
anybody
can
then
without
giving
tom
a
chance
to
express
his
surprise
he
said
aloud
what
the
use
yanks
of
staying
here
all
night
in
the
dark
and
cold
if
you
will
come
to
the
quarter
i
will
give
you
a
tight
cabin
and
a
bright
fire
to
cheer
you
up
the
offer
was
a
tempting
one
to
men
situated
as
they
were
but
after
a
short
consultation
with
his
comrades
the
corporal
thought
they
had
better
not
accept
it
they
would
feel
safer
and
sleep
more
soundly
right
there
in
the
woods
then
ned
suggested
that
they
should
wrap
themselves
in
the
blankets
and
get
what
rest
they
could
while
he
stood
guard
and
to
his
surprise
and
tom
randolph
unbouded
delight
the
proposition
was
accepted
without
an
instant
hesitation
to
keep
up
appearances
tom
took
the
blanket
that
was
passed
to
him
and
rolled
himself
up
in
it
but
he
had
no
intention
of
going
to
sleep
he
had
another
idea
in
his
head
and
it
was
just
about
as
foolish
as
his
notion
of
trying
to
pass
himself
off
for
a
soldier
when
he
was
nothing
but
a
home
guard
johnny
and
many
thanks
for
that
grub
and
this
warm
blanket
said
one
of
the
escaped
prisoners
who
had
not
spoken
before
yank
and
welcome
replied
ned
but
i
am
not
a
johnny
and
neither
am
i
a
yank
said
the
soldier
i
came
from
michigan
but
after
that
silence
reigned
in
that
dark
lonesome
camp
for
the
space
of
half
an
hour
the
soldiers
were
weary
and
sank
into
a
deep
slumber
almost
as
soon
as
they
had
adjusted
their
blankets
to
suit
them
but
tom
randolph
was
wide
awake
he
curbed
his
impatience
until
the
heavy
breathing
of
his
captors
told
him
that
they
were
in
a
state
of
unconsciousness
and
then
said
cautiously
ned
ned
have
you
got
a
gun
no
what
do
i
want
of
a
gun
was
the
answer
where
are
they
wrapped
up
in
the
blankets
with
the
soldiers
most
likely
well
say
ned
look
here
whispered
tom
coaxingly
it
no
use
for
i
ca
do
it
replied
ned
who
knew
what
the
captive
was
about
to
say
you
do
show
your
usual
good
sense
in
asking
it
of
me
either
but
you
could
drop
asleep
could
you
and
let
me
crawl
away
i
could
but
i
wo
i
not
going
to
get
myself
into
a
scrape
by
going
back
on
these
yanks
they
shoot
me
but
you
might
go
with
me
suggested
tom
who
was
almost
ready
to
shed
tears
again
and
leave
gray
property
to
be
destroyed
demanded
ned
i
said
i
keep
guard
and
i
got
to
do
it
well
you
have
been
weighed
and
found
wanting
said
tom
desperately
i
know
just
what
you
are
now
but
i
was
foolish
enough
to
think
you
were
a
friend
of
mine
you
did
think
anything
of
the
sort
you
knew
better
said
ned
and
after
that
he
relapsed
into
silence
he
had
proved
that
he
was
ready
to
assist
tom
in
any
way
he
could
but
he
was
going
to
arouse
ben
rage
and
the
corporal
by
permitting
him
to
steal
away
in
the
darkness
it
was
the
most
senseless
proposition
he
had
ever
heard
of
and
he
was
glad
that
tom
did
not
trouble
him
with
it
again
the
latter
lay
so
quiet
that
his
guard
thought
he
was
asleep
but
he
was
he
was
trying
to
think
up
some
way
to
get
even
with
ned
although
the
overseer
was
not
at
all
drowsy
the
exciting
events
of
the
last
few
hours
having
banished
slumber
he
passed
a
dreary
night
on
his
log
leaning
against
a
tree
and
listening
for
the
first
baying
of
the
hounds
which
would
announce
that
the
pursuit
had
been
renewed
but
the
hours
dragged
themselves
away
without
disturbance
of
any
kind
and
at
daylight
the
corporal
threw
off
his
blanket
and
sat
up
he
felt
like
a
new
man
after
his
refreshing
sleep
and
that
was
what
all
his
comrades
said
when
they
were
aroused
then
a
short
consultation
was
held
and
ned
posted
off
to
the
house
with
the
empty
basket
it
was
full
of
eatables
when
he
returned
an
hour
later
to
learn
that
during
his
absence
the
fugitives
had
decided
that
tom
randolph
story
was
more
worthy
of
belief
than
his
own
it
does
stand
to
reason
that
a
man
would
tell
such
damaging
things
about
himself
just
for
fun
said
the
corporal
who
spoke
for
all
his
companions
he
was
as
defiant
as
you
please
when
we
captured
him
and
i
but
i
told
you
a
pack
of
lies
i
did
indeed
cried
tom
hiding
his
face
in
his
hands
we
do
believe
it
answered
the
soldier
your
weakening
is
all
put
on
because
you
have
learned
that
it
is
such
a
funny
thing
to
be
a
prisoner
as
you
thought
it
was
and
even
if
you
did
lie
to
us
you
are
a
home
guard
and
that
is
against
you
if
you
have
done
any
mean
things
it
because
you
have
had
the
chance
to
tom
randolph
rage
and
disgust
ned
did
not
try
to
combat
this
decision
he
simply
said
all
right
just
as
you
say
keep
a
stiff
upper
lip
tom
and
i
will
go
and
get
rodney
this
was
the
substance
of
the
story
that
ned
griffin
told
while
he
was
sitting
in
gray
dining
room
on
the
morning
of
which
we
have
spoken
of
course
he
did
not
tell
it
exactly
as
we
have
tried
to
but
he
told
enough
to
give
his
auditors
a
clear
idea
of
what
had
happened
on
his
plantation
the
night
before
they
heard
him
through
without
interruption
and
when
his
narrative
was
ended
they
settled
back
in
their
chairs
and
looked
at
one
another
there
was
one
thought
uppermost
in
their
minds
those
escaped
prisoners
deserved
their
freedom
after
working
so
hard
for
it
even
if
they
were
lincoln
hirelings
and
rodney
must
see
them
safe
to
the
river
as
to
tom
did
not
waste
much
sympathy
on
him
but
they
were
sorry
for
his
mother
tom
took
just
such
chances
as
these
when
he
put
on
his
gray
uniform
chapter
xiii
captain
tom
shows
his
gratitude
when
ned
griffin
brought
his
exciting
narrative
to
a
close
gray
beckoned
him
to
a
seat
at
the
table
and
gave
him
a
cup
of
coffee
while
rodney
sent
one
of
the
girls
to
his
room
after
a
couple
of
overcoats
and
rosebud
to
the
stable
to
see
the
saddle
put
on
his
horse
and
dick
he
was
elated
over
the
prospect
of
doing
even
a
little
to
help
the
federal
soldiers
who
had
shown
themselves
so
friendly
to
himself
and
his
chum
and
determined
that
tom
randolph
should
not
go
to
a
northern
prison
if
he
could
prevent
it
tom
was
an
old
acquaintance
and
a
near
neighbor
and
that
meant
a
good
deal
to
rodney
gray
ned
was
a
little
apprehensive
that
his
employer
might
not
be
altogether
pleased
with
what
he
had
done
but
to
his
relief
gray
did
not
have
a
word
of
fault
to
find
rodney
seems
to
have
made
up
his
mind
to
help
those
yankees
through
said
he
addressing
himself
to
the
overseer
and
i
need
not
tell
you
that
i
shall
be
glad
to
have
you
do
anything
you
can
to
aid
him
and
them
as
to
looks
now
as
though
he
would
have
to
stand
punishment
for
his
foolishness
and
how
about
me
said
rodney
it
looks
as
though
i
was
planning
to
get
myself
into
trouble
if
i
help
the
yankees
my
confederate
neighbors
will
be
down
on
me
and
if
i
help
tom
they
be
down
on
and
union
how
are
the
neighbors
going
to
find
it
out
inquired
dick
oh
tom
will
tell
them
said
rodney
carelessly
and
are
you
going
to
help
a
man
who
will
turn
around
and
blab
it
on
purpose
to
bring
you
into
trouble
exclaimed
dick
i
should
think
his
gratitude
is
the
rarest
sentiment
in
the
world
my
dear
boy
as
you
will
learn
long
before
your
head
is
as
white
as
mine
he
do
me
a
mean
turn
the
first
good
chance
he
gets
that
the
kind
of
a
chap
he
is
have
you
got
your
discharge
in
your
pocket
all
right
i
know
when
you
will
see
us
again
said
rodney
when
the
overcoats
made
their
appearance
and
the
horses
were
brought
to
the
door
but
when
we
return
we
hope
to
have
some
better
fitting
clothes
than
these
and
a
pass
from
the
provost
marshal
so
mother
if
you
have
any
currency
that
you
can
spare
i
shall
be
glad
to
have
some
these
last
words
were
whispered
into
the
ear
of
his
mother
who
led
him
to
her
room
where
she
kept
a
small
store
of
specie
for
an
emergency
where
the
rest
was
rodney
did
not
know
or
care
to
inquire
it
was
enough
for
him
that
he
could
get
a
few
pieces
as
often
as
he
found
it
necessary
to
ask
for
them
now
do
be
careful
pleaded
his
mother
suppose
the
hounds
strike
your
trail
in
spite
of
all
you
can
do
to
prevent
it
and
the
soldiers
with
them
find
you
and
dick
in
the
company
of
the
escaped
prisoners
your
discharges
would
not
save
you
do
cross
a
bridge
till
you
come
to
it
mother
answered
rodney
who
had
thought
of
all
this
while
ned
griffin
was
telling
his
story
we
are
not
going
into
any
danger
in
a
few
minutes
the
boys
were
riding
toward
plantation
they
reined
up
to
the
house
and
turned
their
horses
over
to
a
darkey
as
any
casual
visitors
would
have
done
for
ned
told
them
that
the
rest
of
their
journey
must
be
made
on
foot
and
under
cover
of
bushes
and
fences
there
no
telling
who
may
be
on
the
watch
said
he
or
whether
all
our
blacks
are
as
loyal
as
they
pretend
to
be
and
boys
do
say
a
word
in
tom
hearing
about
showing
the
yanks
the
way
to
the
river
he
take
it
for
granted
of
course
that
somebody
is
going
to
do
it
but
we
make
it
hard
for
him
to
prove
it
on
any
of
us
rodney
did
not
waste
many
minutes
in
comparing
notes
with
griffin
he
already
knew
everything
she
could
have
told
him
but
threw
his
overcoat
across
his
arm
and
motioned
to
ned
to
go
ahead
with
the
basketful
of
things
that
had
been
provided
for
the
fugitives
dinner
it
took
them
of
an
hour
to
reach
the
edge
of
the
woods
so
slow
and
cautious
were
they
in
their
movements
and
they
found
two
of
the
soldiers
at
the
fence
waiting
for
them
rodney
and
dick
recognized
them
on
the
instant
and
shook
hands
with
them
through
the
fence
as
cordially
as
though
they
had
always
been
the
warmest
of
friends
say
whispered
rodney
as
soon
as
the
greeting
was
over
call
up
the
corporal
and
the
other
yank
i
have
a
few
words
to
say
to
you
that
i
do
want
your
prisoner
to
hear
are
you
afraid
of
him
too
asked
one
of
the
soldiers
then
i
understand
why
you
are
so
anxious
to
have
him
go
free
we
ca
leave
him
in
camp
alone
for
if
we
do
he
run
off
he
has
the
pluck
to
try
it
said
ned
passing
his
basket
over
the
fence
but
i
stay
with
him
you
are
not
afraid
to
trust
me
i
suppose
after
allowing
me
to
stand
guard
over
him
all
night
but
ned
had
told
of
the
astounding
proposition
tom
made
while
he
was
standing
guard
over
him
that
was
something
he
kept
to
himself
until
he
told
his
story
in
gray
dining
room
he
climbed
the
fence
and
disappeared
in
the
woods
and
presently
the
corporal
and
the
other
yank
came
up
if
anyone
had
told
me
that
i
ever
shake
hands
with
a
rebel
in
this
friendly
way
i
should
have
said
he
did
know
what
he
was
talking
about
said
the
corporal
johnny
how
are
you
by
this
time
you
and
your
chum
must
have
got
safe
home
or
else
you
would
be
here
you
know
our
story
of
course
so
there
no
need
of
telling
it
over
again
no
need
and
no
time
replied
rodney
for
you
ought
to
be
jogging
along
now
you
an
open
and
dangerous
country
before
you
and
very
likely
every
man
in
it
is
on
the
lookout
for
you
that
about
what
griffin
said
to
us
last
night
replied
the
corporal
we
asked
him
to
act
as
our
guide
but
he
thinks
you
can
be
of
more
use
to
us
i
do
know
about
that
but
i
will
do
my
best
on
one
condition
of
course
the
soldiers
knew
what
that
condition
was
but
listened
patiently
while
rodney
went
on
to
tell
them
that
they
never
made
a
greater
mistake
in
their
lives
than
they
did
when
they
put
faith
in
tom
randolph
story
and
rejected
ned
griffin
he
urged
them
to
release
tom
without
any
more
nonsense
and
hinted
that
the
sooner
they
complied
with
his
request
the
sooner
he
would
be
ready
to
start
with
them
for
baton
rouge
he
also
added
if
you
are
bound
to
take
tom
with
you
i
ca
go
and
you
have
to
do
the
best
you
can
for
yourselves
he
find
means
to
let
my
rebel
neighbors
hear
of
it
and
then
i
have
to
go
among
the
yanks
or
back
to
the
army
for
i
could
live
here
what
do
you
say
what
do
you
say
boys
inquired
the
corporal
turning
to
his
companions
he
a
home
guard
and
a
mighty
mean
one
too
judging
none
of
that
please
rodney
interposed
having
submitted
the
case
you
have
no
business
to
keep
on
arguing
it
yes
or
no
yanks
i
wish
we
had
knocked
him
on
the
head
before
we
took
him
prisoner
said
ben
who
could
not
forget
his
lost
comrade
but
you
did
and
you
ca
very
well
do
it
now
replied
rodney
are
you
going
to
let
him
go
or
not
ben
did
not
answer
but
his
three
companions
gave
a
favorable
though
very
reluctant
response
to
rodney
question
and
the
latter
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
ben
looked
and
acted
ugly
and
if
he
had
been
a
little
better
talker
tom
randolph
chances
for
liberty
and
life
would
have
been
slim
indeed
as
dick
graham
afterward
explained
it
tom
was
saved
by
ben
want
of
gab
rodney
next
care
was
to
urge
upon
the
soldiers
the
necessity
of
sending
tom
about
his
business
with
the
least
possible
delay
and
of
being
careful
to
drop
no
word
in
his
hearing
that
would
give
him
a
hint
of
their
future
movements
tom
would
make
all
sorts
of
promises
but
they
must
not
put
the
least
faith
in
them
for
if
he
saw
an
opportunity
to
do
it
he
would
put
a
squad
on
their
trail
in
less
than
an
hour
this
done
he
and
dick
climbed
the
fence
and
followed
the
soldiers
toward
the
camp
ned
griffin
had
had
time
to
prepare
tom
for
rodney
coming
and
the
expression
rodney
face
wore
when
he
appeared
in
sight
prepared
him
for
the
good
news
you
have
prevailed
upon
them
to
release
me
and
i
know
it
he
exclaimed
seizing
one
of
rodney
hands
in
both
his
own
and
shaking
it
with
all
his
might
and
i
never
forget
you
for
it
never
in
this
world
if
you
want
anything
all
you
got
to
do
is
to
say
the
word
and
if
i
got
it
you
shall
have
it
and
as
for
you
cook
up
some
sort
of
a
story
when
i
reach
home
that
will
stop
all
pursuit
till
you
have
had
time
to
reach
the
union
lines
i
am
very
grateful
to
you
and
will
prove
it
by
pulling
off
my
gray
suit
as
soon
as
i
get
home
if
all
yanks
are
like
you
i
am
not
going
to
fight
any
more
during
the
war
tom
was
sure
he
saw
a
faint
prospect
of
escape
before
him
and
his
joy
was
so
great
that
it
choked
his
utterance
he
continued
to
rattle
on
in
this
way
until
the
corporal
interrupted
him
with
that
all
right
johnny
so
long
as
you
keep
the
hounds
off
our
trail
it
all
the
return
we
ask
for
setting
you
at
liberty
then
you
are
going
to
release
me
aint
you
cried
tom
i
do
suppose
such
a
thing
was
ever
done
before
said
the
corporal
hesitatingly
and
i
do
know
what
the
boys
will
say
to
me
when
they
hear
of
it
but
that
do
make
any
difference
mr
soldier
you
just
tell
me
to
go
home
and
i
will
keep
the
hounds
off
your
trail
said
the
corporal
you
will
find
your
sword
and
revolver
back
there
in
the
grove
where
we
hid
them
yesterday
tom
lost
no
time
in
grasping
the
corporal
hand
and
shaking
it
with
all
his
proceeding
to
which
the
boy
in
blue
submitted
with
very
bad
grace
he
felt
more
like
giving
his
late
captive
a
kick
and
so
did
his
comrades
but
they
let
him
shake
their
hands
except
ben
who
put
his
hands
into
his
pockets
and
turned
away
when
tom
approached
him
captain
randolph
would
have
persisted
in
his
efforts
to
take
leave
of
him
also
had
he
not
been
warned
by
a
look
from
rodney
that
he
had
better
stop
his
nonsense
and
get
away
while
the
federals
were
in
the
humor
to
let
him
go
acting
upon
the
hint
he
turned
away
from
ben
and
disappeared
in
the
direction
of
the
fence
if
i
am
any
prophet
that
surly
yank
will
see
the
time
when
he
wish
he
had
not
turned
his
back
on
me
in
that
style
soliloquized
tom
when
he
found
himself
safe
in
the
lane
i
square
accounts
with
him
and
with
rodney
and
dick
at
the
same
time
and
ned
griffin
too
i
might
have
given
those
yanks
the
slip
last
night
if
he
had
been
friendly
enough
to
fall
asleep
as
i
wanted
him
to
do
but
he
would
and
now
he
will
see
how
i
will
pay
him
for
it
tom
sped
along
the
lane
as
if
he
had
been
furnished
with
wings
through
the
negro
quarter
and
up
to
the
door
of
the
plantation
house
where
ned
mother
was
waiting
for
him
she
had
moved
her
low
rocking
chair
to
that
door
and
had
been
waiting
there
ever
since
she
saw
rodney
gray
and
his
two
companions
disappear
in
the
woods
at
the
end
of
the
lane
for
she
felt
the
keenest
anxiety
for
tom
and
wondered
what
his
mother
would
do
if
rodney
failed
in
his
efforts
to
have
him
released
o
tom
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
she
exclaimed
as
soon
as
the
captain
of
the
home
guards
came
within
speaking
distance
i
am
a
free
man
once
more
griffin
replied
tom
loftily
and
it
is
a
fortunate
thing
for
some
people
whose
names
i
could
mention
if
i
had
been
kept
a
prisoner
my
home
guards
would
have
made
sad
work
in
this
settlement
i
thank
you
to
lend
me
a
horse
i
want
to
reach
home
as
soon
as
i
can
in
order
to
relieve
my
mother
anxiety
and
this
was
all
he
had
to
say
to
the
woman
who
had
done
more
than
anybody
else
to
keep
him
out
of
prison
by
her
kindness
and
generosity
she
had
won
the
gratitude
of
tom
captors
and
made
it
comparatively
easy
for
rodney
to
effect
his
release
and
although
tom
did
not
know
this
he
did
know
that
ned
had
done
his
best
for
him
and
one
would
think
he
might
have
had
a
civil
word
for
ned
mother
instead
of
that
he
hinted
darkly
at
some
things
he
knew
about
some
people
whose
names
he
could
mention
and
griffin
knew
that
that
was
the
same
thing
as
a
threat
she
replied
that
she
did
not
feel
at
liberty
to
lend
without
saying
a
word
to
him
about
it
but
tom
could
have
a
mule
if
he
wanted
it
and
with
the
words
she
went
into
the
house
leaving
captain
randolph
to
stand
alone
at
the
door
until
the
mule
was
brought
up
this
is
another
insult
i
shall
have
to
remember
against
the
griffins
thought
tom
running
his
eye
over
the
animal
that
was
finally
led
to
the
door
now
how
shall
i
manage
to
have
those
escaped
prisoners
captured
with
the
least
possible
delay
if
they
could
be
taken
now
rodney
and
dick
and
ned
would
be
taken
with
them
but
i
do
know
whether
i
want
that
to
happen
or
not
if
it
should
get
noised
abroad
that
they
were
captured
with
my
help
or
through
information
furnished
by
me
i
have
everybody
in
the
settlement
down
on
me
and
goodness
knows
i
got
enemies
enough
already
this
was
a
matter
requiring
thought
and
in
order
that
he
might
have
plenty
of
leisure
to
devote
to
it
captain
tom
allowed
his
mule
to
walk
every
step
of
the
five
miles
that
lay
between
the
plantation
and
mooreville
he
rode
past
gray
house
without
stopping
and
in
due
time
drew
rein
in
front
of
kimberly
store
to
find
the
usual
number
of
lazy
home
guards
loitering
about
there
doing
nothing
they
were
surprised
to
see
him
for
the
news
of
his
sudden
and
mysterious
disappearance
had
been
spread
all
through
the
settlement
his
father
who
had
spent
half
the
night
riding
about
in
search
of
him
pretended
to
believe
that
tom
had
fallen
in
with
the
soldiers
from
camp
pinckney
and
joined
them
in
pursuit
of
the
escaped
yankees
but
there
was
a
man
in
the
country
who
did
laugh
at
the
idea
as
soon
as
he
heard
of
it
more
than
that
there
was
a
single
member
of
the
home
guards
who
had
made
an
earnest
effort
to
trace
the
fugitives
the
most
of
them
paid
no
attention
to
tom
order
to
turn
out
and
those
who
did
returned
to
their
homes
as
soon
as
they
learned
that
the
yankees
were
armed
why
where
in
the
wide
world
did
you
drop
from
exclaimed
lieutenant
lambert
as
tom
randolph
rolled
off
his
mule
in
front
of
the
store
have
you
been
after
them
yanks
your
pap
said
you
had
tom
walked
into
the
recruiting
office
and
met
captain
roach
who
began
to
tell
him
how
his
unexplained
absence
had
frightened
his
mother
but
the
commander
of
the
home
guards
interrupted
him
without
ceremony
before
i
tell
you
anything
about
myself
said
he
turning
to
the
eager
home
guards
who
had
followed
him
into
the
office
i
want
to
know
how
many
of
you
men
would
like
to
win
fame
and
perhaps
promotion
by
capturing
the
four
yankees
who
are
roaming
about
the
country
shooting
our
comrades
down
in
cold
blood
i
would
for
one
replied
lambert
promptly
and
me
and
me
and
here
too
chimed
in
the
others
and
they
threw
so
much
earnestness
into
their
words
and
seemed
so
impatient
to
learn
how
the
feat
could
be
accomplished
that
a
stranger
would
have
thought
they
really
meant
to
do
something
i
am
glad
to
see
you
so
patriotic
said
captain
tom
and
the
way
for
you
to
prove
your
words
is
know
where
ned
griffin
lives
now
do
you
well
go
down
there
at
once
and
you
will
find
the
men
you
want
at
the
foot
of
his
lane
how
do
you
know
that
demanded
captain
roach
because
i
left
them
there
not
more
mean
when
i
escaped
from
them
last
night
answered
tom
who
now
that
the
danger
was
past
would
not
have
sold
his
experience
for
any
reasonable
sum
of
money
you
do
believe
it
do
you
well
it
is
a
fact
that
i
have
been
a
prisoner
in
the
hands
of
those
very
men
and
narrowly
escaped
being
shot
but
how
did
you
get
away
from
them
continued
the
enrolling
officer
i
knocked
one
of
them
down
with
the
butt
of
his
own
musket
and
took
to
my
heels
that
the
way
i
did
it
this
was
going
too
far
and
captain
tom
was
quick
to
perceive
it
some
of
his
men
exchanged
sly
winks
with
each
other
and
turned
toward
the
door
as
if
they
had
heard
quite
enough
of
such
stories
as
that
while
captain
roach
who
had
put
a
little
faith
in
tom
tale
at
first
sat
down
in
his
chair
and
pulled
some
papers
toward
him
continue
to
report
regularly
every
day
said
he
addressing
himself
to
lambert
i
have
received
no
official
notice
that
camp
pinckney
is
ready
to
take
conscripts
but
all
the
same
i
know
it
is
ready
and
an
order
to
send
out
a
squad
may
come
any
hour
that
a
polite
way
of
calling
me
a
liar
said
tom
to
himself
i
know
where
i
can
find
those
who
will
take
some
interest
in
what
i
have
to
say
and
if
i
do
go
there
and
drop
a
bomb
into
this
camp
that
will
scatter
it
far
and
wide
i
a
dutchman
he
was
too
angry
to
say
anything
aloud
he
looked
hard
at
captain
roach
for
a
moment
and
then
went
out
to
the
hitching
rack
where
he
had
left
his
mule
the
home
guards
dividing
right
and
left
and
making
no
remark
as
he
passed
through
their
ranks
he
went
home
with
all
the
speed
he
could
induce
his
beast
to
put
forth
and
the
reception
he
met
when
he
got
there
almost
made
amends
for
the
deliberate
slight
that
had
been
put
upon
him
in
the
enrolling
office
but
the
best
part
of
the
story
he
intended
to
tell
was
knocked
in
the
head
by
the
first
words
his
mother
said
to
him
he
was
going
to
describe
a
terrific
battle
he
had
had
with
the
escaped
prisoners
somewhere
in
the
woods
but
his
mother
cried
as
she
ran
down
the
steps
and
clasped
him
in
her
arms
o
tom
where
have
you
been
and
how
came
your
horse
hitched
out
there
in
the
grove
captain
randolph
had
forgotten
all
about
his
horse
and
just
then
he
wished
that
one
of
the
yankees
had
put
a
bullet
through
the
head
instead
of
tying
him
among
the
evergreens
then
he
could
have
said
that
he
did
not
surrender
without
a
fight
and
the
dead
horse
would
have
proved
it
some
of
the
neighbors
heard
him
calling
as
they
were
riding
along
the
road
and
went
in
and
brought
him
home
but
they
saw
no
signs
of
you
continued
randolph
looking
hard
at
tom
as
if
to
assure
herself
that
he
was
all
there
you
do
know
how
frightened
we
all
were
the
first
thing
i
thought
of
was
those
dreadful
yankees
and
i
was
afraid
you
might
have
fallen
into
their
hands
and
that
just
what
happened
to
me
replied
tom
i
was
a
prisoner
in
less
than
an
hour
after
i
left
you
yesterday
but
i
made
something
of
a
fight
before
they
took
me
i
think
i
know
where
my
revolver
threw
it
into
the
bushes
rather
than
give
it
up
to
the
enemy
oh
you
reckless
boy
how
could
you
do
it
exclaimed
his
mother
come
right
in
and
go
to
bed
and
when
you
see
that
revolver
you
will
notice
that
there
is
a
single
cartridge
left
in
it
added
captain
tom
as
he
followed
his
mother
up
the
steps
i
threw
away
my
sword
too
but
think
i
can
find
it
again
i
did
surrender
mind
you
i
was
captured
at
the
muzzle
of
four
loaded
muskets
you
dear
boy
and
how
did
you
get
away
from
them
i
waited
until
they
went
to
sleep
last
night
of
course
they
left
one
of
their
number
to
guard
me
but
a
yankee
is
no
match
for
a
gentleman
when
it
comes
to
a
fight
i
just
knocked
him
down
and
cleared
out
and
was
you
hurt
a
bit
did
they
try
to
stop
you
of
course
they
tried
to
stop
me
and
the
way
the
bullets
flew
was
a
caution
but
the
night
was
dark
the
bushes
thick
and
i
escaped
without
a
scratch
this
was
only
the
introduction
to
the
long
story
tom
had
to
tell
and
although
there
was
scarcely
a
word
of
truth
in
it
from
beginning
to
end
his
doting
mother
believed
it
all
his
father
looked
slightly
incredulous
when
tom
told
how
he
had
laid
around
in
the
woods
for
long
hours
while
the
yankees
were
searching
high
and
low
to
find
him
for
his
boots
and
clothing
did
not
bear
out
his
thrilling
narrative
they
were
dusty
of
course
but
not
at
all
torn
and
mussed
as
they
ought
to
have
been
if
the
wearer
had
had
such
a
time
working
his
way
out
of
the
woods
but
randolph
was
so
overjoyed
to
see
tom
back
safe
and
sound
that
he
said
nothing
about
it
now
my
son
you
must
quit
the
home
guards
at
once
and
stay
right
here
on
the
plantation
said
randolph
when
she
had
asked
her
hero
all
the
questions
she
could
think
of
when
you
are
a
private
citizen
you
will
not
be
called
upon
to
assist
in
capturing
desperadoes
i
done
the
very
best
i
could
for
the
south
ever
since
i
joined
my
fortunes
with
hers
answered
captain
tom
i
have
risked
life
and
liberty
in
her
defence
more
than
once
and
am
ready
to
do
it
again
but
i
ca
fight
the
whole
yankee
nation
alone
and
unaided
certainly
not
assented
his
mother
i
was
the
only
one
of
the
company
who
had
the
pluck
to
face
those
desperate
men
in
the
woods
continued
tom
and
was
captured
for
my
pains
i
ordered
my
men
out
to
help
me
but
they
never
came
they
left
me
to
meet
the
danger
alone
and
when
i
dropped
into
the
enrolling
office
on
my
way
home
they
were
loafing
as
usual
and
bragging
too
and
when
i
told
them
right
where
they
would
find
those
yanks
and
tried
to
get
them
to
go
out
and
capture
them
do
you
suppose
they
would
go
they
just
as
good
as
told
me
that
they
did
not
believe
me
and
roach
broke
in
on
my
story
by
giving
orders
directly
to
lambert
instead
of
passing
them
to
him
through
me
i
have
put
up
with
that
man
just
as
long
as
i
am
going
to
and
father
if
you
will
pay
larkin
off
and
let
him
go
i
be
ready
to
take
his
place
morning
and
now
write
to
the
governor
the
very
first
thing
i
do
this
letter
to
the
governor
tendering
his
resignation
as
captain
of
state
troops
was
the
bomb
with
which
tom
had
threatened
to
scatter
captain
roach
camp
far
and
wide
but
when
he
sat
down
to
write
it
the
thought
occurred
to
him
that
if
he
said
too
much
the
letter
might
operate
like
a
boomerang
and
hurt
him
more
than
he
hoped
to
hurt
captain
roach
if
he
had
written
it
as
he
had
it
framed
in
his
mind
it
would
have
been
a
complete
and
scathing
indictment
of
the
enrolling
officer
way
of
doing
business
but
the
letter
he
showed
his
mother
when
she
came
to
his
room
in
response
to
his
call
read
something
like
this
i
have
the
honor
to
tender
herewith
my
resignation
as
captain
of
the
state
militia
which
was
granted
me
on
the
day
of
april
last
with
authority
to
raise
and
command
a
company
of
mounted
men
for
home
defence
i
have
long
been
of
opinion
that
partisan
organizations
are
not
what
we
need
in
this
hour
of
our
country
peril
and
now
i
am
satisfied
of
it
our
best
men
long
ago
went
to
the
front
voluntarily
leaving
behind
them
a
rabble
who
can
not
possibly
be
made
into
soldiers
the
men
under
my
command
were
selected
with
the
greatest
care
but
i
am
obliged
to
say
that
they
are
fit
for
nothing
but
guard
duty
at
camp
pinckney
if
they
were
ordered
there
in
a
body
to
take
the
place
of
better
men
who
could
be
sent
to
the
front
it
would
be
a
relief
to
the
community
for
myself
i
have
other
ideas
which
i
shall
proceed
to
carry
out
as
soon
as
i
receive
notice
that
my
resignation
has
been
accepted
that
is
nothing
but
the
truth
said
randolph
after
she
had
read
the
letter
but
tom
i
am
afraid
it
will
get
you
into
trouble
i
do
see
how
was
the
reply
you
do
suppose
that
the
governor
will
bring
it
down
here
show
it
to
such
fellows
as
lambert
and
moseley
and
the
rest
and
ask
them
what
they
think
of
it
do
you
he
has
other
fish
to
fry
but
suppose
he
should
ask
you
what
your
other
ideas
are
said
his
mother
there
no
danger
of
that
if
the
governor
thinks
that
my
chief
reason
for
resigning
is
because
i
want
to
go
to
the
front
well
and
good
i
am
not
to
blame
for
what
he
thinks
i
have
other
ideas
and
that
a
fact
and
one
of
them
is
to
see
the
men
who
winked
and
nudged
one
another
when
i
was
trying
to
put
a
little
courage
into
them
sent
where
they
will
be
held
with
their
noses
close
to
the
grindstone
now
ride
down
and
mail
this
and
when
the
acceptance
comes
i
tell
roach
what
i
have
done
that
reminds
me
that
the
mail
carrier
had
a
race
with
a
squad
of
yankee
cavalry
yesterday
said
randolph
great
scott
exclaimed
tom
have
they
come
as
close
as
that
to
mooreville
they
are
bound
to
get
here
sooner
or
later
but
i
hope
they
stay
away
a
week
longer
for
then
i
shall
be
a
free
man
and
captain
tom
might
have
added
that
he
would
be
glad
to
see
the
federals
at
the
end
of
a
week
provided
he
received
a
favorable
answer
from
the
governor
in
that
time
when
the
home
guards
were
ordered
away
to
do
duty
at
camp
pinckney
he
would
consider
his
account
with
them
settled
and
the
other
old
were
four
of
them
be
attended
to
at
some
future
time
chapter
xiv
rodney
keeps
his
promise
when
captain
randolph
was
done
with
his
he
hastened
away
as
if
he
feared
that
the
escaped
prisoners
might
change
their
minds
and
call
him
back
he
was
out
of
sight
in
an
instant
and
when
he
was
out
of
hearing
rodney
gray
said
now
we
must
ourselves
i
do
know
what
sort
of
a
story
tom
will
tell
when
he
gets
home
but
it
is
safe
to
say
that
he
will
make
himself
out
a
very
brave
fellow
and
urge
his
men
to
take
up
our
trail
at
once
you
need
trouble
yourself
about
the
home
guards
said
ned
i
do
but
if
those
same
home
guards
should
chance
to
stumble
upon
the
soldiers
from
camp
pinckney
we
have
something
to
trouble
ourselves
about
would
we
so
i
say
we
had
better
move
away
from
here
pick
up
that
basket
somebody
and
ned
you
take
care
of
the
quilts
for
we
not
need
them
we
shall
lie
by
during
the
daytime
and
travel
at
night
you
have
heard
the
last
of
this
morning
work
ned
and
neither
have
i
if
that
home
guard
gets
you
into
trouble
after
what
you
have
done
for
him
find
means
to
let
the
michigan
cavalry
know
it
and
the
first
time
we
scout
through
here
we
pay
our
respects
to
him
said
ben
hotly
if
it
had
been
for
griffin
mother
captain
randolph
would
have
gone
to
a
northern
stockade
as
sure
as
he
is
a
living
man
i
bear
that
in
mind
replied
ned
boys
yanks
may
the
best
of
good
luck
always
attend
you
johnny
said
the
fugitives
in
concert
this
parting
would
have
disgusted
captain
randolph
if
he
had
been
there
to
witness
it
and
might
have
led
him
to
say
this
is
another
insult
that
i
got
to
remember
against
the
griffin
family
for
there
was
a
good
deal
of
friendly
feeling
manifested
on
both
sides
surly
ben
did
not
turn
his
back
this
time
but
held
fast
to
ned
with
one
hand
while
he
pointed
to
the
shoes
he
wore
with
the
other
and
said
if
i
get
away
i
shall
have
you
to
thank
for
it
i
could
have
walked
a
mile
with
my
feet
on
the
ground
as
they
were
when
you
took
pity
on
me
last
night
if
i
can
ever
repay
you
i
will
you
have
repaid
me
a
hundred
times
over
by
letting
rodney
and
dick
go
free
when
you
captured
them
a
few
days
ago
yanks
fall
in
said
rodney
ned
i
wish
you
would
make
it
your
business
to
tell
mother
that
you
saw
us
safely
off
ned
began
to
roll
up
the
quilts
the
corporal
shouldered
the
basket
containing
the
provisions
and
rodney
led
the
way
deeper
into
the
woods
the
soldiers
coming
next
in
line
and
dick
graham
bringing
up
the
rear
and
as
he
trudged
along
in
silence
he
had
much
to
say
to
himself
was
this
rodney
gray
who
was
risking
so
much
to
guide
these
ragged
men
to
a
place
of
safety
the
same
rabid
secessionist
who
once
wanted
to
ride
over
everybody
who
stood
up
for
the
union
who
had
not
scrupled
to
bring
his
own
cousin
into
serious
difficulty
on
account
of
his
loyalty
to
the
old
flag
who
applauded
so
lustily
when
the
mobile
said
that
northern
soldiers
were
knaves
and
vagrants
who
were
fit
for
nothing
but
to
be
whipped
by
niggers
and
who
declared
he
would
not
pull
off
his
gray
suit
until
the
south
had
gained
her
independence
we
said
that
fifteen
months
experience
in
the
army
of
the
confederacy
which
never
kept
a
single
one
of
the
promises
it
made
to
those
who
enlisted
under
its
banner
had
opened
rodney
gray
eyes
and
although
he
still
believed
in
state
rights
he
did
not
believe
in
fighting
for
a
government
that
had
deliberately
gone
to
work
to
make
conscripts
of
its
volunteers
nor
did
he
longer
believe
that
northern
men
did
know
how
to
fight
the
way
they
thrashed
him
and
his
comrades
in
missouri
proved
that
they
did
dick
graham
was
like
marcy
gray
rodney
cousin
he
loved
the
union
and
the
flag
that
waved
over
it
but
unlike
marcy
he
thought
it
his
duty
to
stand
by
his
state
when
van
dorn
was
whipped
at
pea
ridge
dick
graham
was
willing
to
lay
down
his
arms
and
give
up
the
useless
struggle
but
the
government
at
richmond
would
let
him
it
made
conscripts
of
him
and
all
the
other
state
men
who
had
enlisted
under
governor
jackson
proclamation
and
ordered
them
across
the
mississippi
to
join
the
army
of
the
centre
under
beauregard
dick
went
because
he
could
not
help
himself
and
did
his
duty
faithfully
while
he
remained
but
he
had
his
discharge
in
his
pocket
now
and
said
there
would
have
to
be
a
marked
change
in
his
feelings
before
he
would
swear
away
his
liberty
again
there
were
many
like
him
he
thought
of
all
the
men
in
his
company
and
regiment
with
whom
he
had
been
on
terms
of
intimacy
and
could
not
name
half
a
dozen
who
would
have
said
a
harsh
word
to
rodney
gray
if
they
had
known
what
he
was
doing
at
that
moment
the
most
of
them
would
have
done
the
same
thing
and
been
glad
of
the
chance
although
rodney
exercised
little
or
no
caution
in
threading
his
way
through
the
woods
he
insisted
that
there
should
be
no
talking
among
his
followers
the
slight
rustling
they
made
in
the
bushes
might
not
attract
attention
because
there
were
so
many
cattle
and
hogs
running
at
large
in
the
timber
but
the
sound
of
a
voice
would
betray
them
to
anyone
who
might
happen
to
be
within
hearing
their
progress
was
easy
enough
until
they
reached
the
place
where
the
woods
ended
and
the
broad
cultivated
fields
began
and
then
rodney
announced
that
it
was
time
for
the
fugitives
to
halt
and
get
a
little
sleep
if
they
could
while
he
and
dick
went
on
ahead
to
see
how
things
looked
from
here
on
there
is
little
cover
except
such
as
we
shall
find
in
blind
ditches
and
behind
fences
said
he
you
boys
take
a
bite
and
a
nap
and
dick
and
i
will
go
to
that
plantation
house
you
see
over
there
and
inquire
about
our
friends
from
camp
pinckney
i
am
somewhat
anxious
to
know
where
they
are
do
be
in
any
haste
to
challenge
or
shoot
when
you
hear
us
coming
back
i
suppose
you
know
the
people
who
live
in
that
house
said
dick
as
he
and
rodney
started
off
after
taking
leave
of
the
federals
what
sort
of
a
story
are
you
going
to
tell
them
i
am
well
acquainted
with
them
answered
rodney
but
whether
or
not
their
friendship
for
our
family
would
lead
them
to
do
these
yanks
a
good
turn
i
ca
say
i
not
trust
them
too
far
till
i
find
out
we
tell
them
the
truth
so
far
as
our
war
record
is
concerned
but
we
hog
and
critter
hunting
when
they
ask
us
what
brought
us
into
the
woods
and
of
course
we
know
all
about
the
escaped
prisoners
rodney
did
not
lead
the
way
directly
toward
the
house
but
worked
his
way
along
a
fence
until
he
reached
a
point
from
which
the
dwelling
could
not
be
seen
and
then
he
and
dick
climbed
over
into
the
field
and
struck
out
across
it
without
making
any
further
attempt
at
concealment
it
never
occurred
to
them
that
possibly
the
little
clump
of
trees
that
hid
the
house
might
also
hide
something
else
from
their
view
but
such
proved
to
be
the
case
for
as
rodney
walked
around
the
corner
of
the
building
with
all
the
confidence
of
a
welcome
visitor
he
was
surprised
and
frightened
to
find
himself
in
the
presence
of
the
very
men
he
came
to
inquire
soldiers
from
camp
pinckney
who
were
sitting
or
lying
at
their
ease
under
the
shade
of
the
trees
while
the
master
of
the
house
and
his
family
moved
among
them
with
steaming
and
trays
filled
with
something
good
to
eat
their
hounds
were
lying
close
by
on
the
grass
their
horses
stood
at
the
front
fence
with
their
heads
down
as
if
asleep
and
both
looked
as
though
they
needed
rest
the
boys
made
a
mental
note
of
these
things
and
walked
straight
ahead
as
if
they
belonged
there
their
approach
being
hailed
with
an
exclamation
of
delight
from
the
owner
of
the
plantation
who
was
the
first
to
catch
sight
of
them
what
do
you
mean
sir
by
such
conduct
said
turnbull
passing
his
well
loaded
tray
to
one
of
the
soldiers
and
hastening
to
meet
rodney
with
outstretched
hand
you
been
at
home
five
or
six
days
and
this
is
the
first
glimpse
we
have
had
of
you
come
up
and
have
a
bite
rodney
thanked
him
and
presented
his
friend
dick
who
was
welcomed
in
the
same
breezy
way
then
they
shook
hands
with
the
other
members
of
the
family
and
were
made
acquainted
with
the
lieutenant
who
commanded
the
one
whom
captain
randolph
had
met
and
talked
with
the
day
before
there
was
also
a
neighbor
present
who
had
come
over
to
hear
what
the
soldiers
had
to
say
about
the
escaped
prisoners
and
about
tom
randolph
whose
mysterious
disappearance
was
the
talk
of
the
planters
for
miles
around
rodney
was
not
pleased
to
see
biglin
that
was
the
neighbor
name
for
he
was
a
secessionist
who
denounced
gray
for
his
moderate
views
and
declared
that
every
man
who
retained
a
spark
of
love
for
the
old
union
ought
to
be
shot
on
sight
now
i
think
we
are
all
happy
and
comfortable
said
turnbull
when
the
boys
had
been
provided
with
plates
and
something
to
put
on
them
and
that
better
provender
i
take
it
than
you
got
in
the
army
eh
rodney
how
do
you
like
army
life
anyway
and
when
are
you
going
back
the
lieutenant
looked
surprised
as
rodney
and
dick
knew
he
would
and
so
they
handed
over
their
discharges
to
prove
that
they
had
seen
service
and
had
the
right
to
be
at
home
at
that
particular
time
we
not
going
to
be
in
any
hurry
answered
rodney
who
thought
all
his
neighbors
ought
to
know
how
he
felt
on
that
point
since
i
came
home
i
have
met
many
civilians
who
were
fierce
for
a
fight
when
this
thing
first
broke
out
and
who
have
yet
put
on
a
gray
jacket
when
i
see
those
men
in
the
front
rank
i
go
back
and
not
before
biglin
winced
and
glanced
uneasily
at
the
soldiers
for
these
remarks
came
pretty
near
applying
to
him
as
rodney
meant
they
should
turnbull
was
exempt
by
reason
of
his
age
and
he
was
a
very
hot
secessionist
either
his
wife
hastened
to
turn
the
conversation
into
another
channel
by
saying
o
rodney
did
you
hear
anything
of
those
escaped
prisoners
in
your
neighborhood
and
do
you
think
they
have
killed
or
captured
tom
randolph
small
loss
began
turnbull
and
then
he
was
checked
by
a
look
from
his
wife
the
latter
knew
that
every
word
that
he
uttered
against
tom
would
get
to
randolph
ears
by
the
shortest
route
and
she
was
afraid
of
home
guards
randolph
was
down
here
last
night
looking
for
tom
continued
turnbull
but
he
told
a
story
that
was
too
funny
for
me
to
believe
he
said
tom
had
gone
out
with
his
home
guards
to
search
for
the
prisoners
but
i
know
better
than
that
and
tom
certainly
did
not
go
into
the
woods
alone
to
hunt
for
them
so
what
chance
had
the
yanks
to
kill
or
capture
him
added
rodney
we
know
that
they
were
in
our
neighborhood
yesterday
for
some
of
these
soldiers
told
my
mother
so
but
they
never
came
near
our
house
i
noticed
you
did
not
come
by
the
road
observed
the
lieutenant
have
you
been
riding
through
the
woods
back
of
this
plantation
dick
and
i
have
been
walking
through
them
but
not
a
horn
nor
a
hoof
did
we
see
answered
rodney
you
know
turnbull
that
my
father
will
have
a
big
lot
of
bacon
and
beef
to
pay
to
the
government
for
the
exemption
of
two
overseers
and
just
now
i
do
know
where
he
is
going
to
get
it
ned
griffin
is
one
overseer
said
turnbull
who
the
other
i
am
i
never
was
a
good
fighter
i
think
i
can
do
the
confederacy
just
as
much
service
by
working
on
a
farm
and
raising
grub
for
the
soldiers
as
i
can
by
staying
in
the
army
at
any
rate
i
am
going
to
try
it
until
some
of
my
neighbors
leave
off
fighting
with
their
mouths
and
shoulder
a
musket
that
fair
i
sure
said
the
lieutenant
while
the
soldiers
winked
and
nodded
at
one
another
as
if
to
say
our
sentiments
exactly
biglin
saw
it
and
it
nettled
him
for
he
had
done
a
great
deal
of
fighting
with
his
mouth
but
every
dollar
he
gave
to
aid
the
cause
of
the
south
was
fairly
squeezed
out
of
him
and
while
you
are
working
one
of
your
father
farms
i
suppose
you
will
hold
yourself
in
readiness
to
help
any
destitute
yankees
who
may
happen
to
come
your
way
said
biglin
if
rodney
and
dick
had
been
the
inexperienced
boys
they
were
when
they
first
entered
the
army
these
startling
words
would
have
knocked
them
out
of
their
chairs
if
biglin
did
know
what
they
had
been
doing
that
morning
his
language
and
actions
seemed
to
indicate
that
he
suspected
it
if
that
was
the
case
the
information
must
have
come
from
tom
randolph
he
had
had
plenty
of
time
to
reach
home
and
spread
the
news
far
and
wide
if
biglin
had
been
content
to
stop
right
there
he
might
have
left
a
bad
impression
upon
the
minds
of
some
of
his
auditors
but
seeing
that
he
had
made
rodney
and
his
friend
uneasy
he
went
on
to
say
i
heard
a
fishy
story
about
your
being
captured
by
yankee
soldiers
who
were
gentlemen
enough
to
release
you
there
nothing
fishy
about
it
replied
rodney
greatly
relieved
i
said
that
dick
and
i
were
captured
and
set
free
again
between
here
and
camp
pinckney
and
it
is
nothing
but
the
truth
i
said
further
that
if
i
ever
saw
those
men
in
trouble
i
would
try
my
best
to
help
them
out
and
i
appeal
to
these
soldiers
here
to
say
if
they
would
do
the
same
i
would
if
i
could
do
it
without
bringing
myself
to
the
notice
of
my
superiors
said
the
lieutenant
while
his
men
nodded
at
rodney
and
one
another
as
they
had
done
before
well
i
would
declared
biglin
in
savage
tones
and
more
than
that
i
would
report
every
soldier
or
civilian
whom
i
knew
to
be
guilty
of
such
a
thing
i
thank
you
for
your
words
said
rodney
to
himself
i
know
now
that
you
not
do
to
tie
to
and
shall
be
careful
that
none
of
my
doings
get
to
your
ears
turnbull
saw
that
it
was
time
for
her
to
interfere
again
two
of
her
guests
were
becoming
almost
red
in
the
face
with
anger
and
her
woman
wit
or
something
else
told
her
that
the
conversation
was
taking
a
dangerous
turn
she
had
wondered
from
the
first
what
brought
rodney
gray
so
far
from
home
on
foot
and
now
she
believed
that
she
knew
all
about
it
she
moved
her
chair
to
the
side
of
rodney
and
asked
the
young
soldier
to
tell
her
a
story
of
army
life
and
as
she
did
so
her
gaze
wandered
through
the
bushes
and
trees
to
the
front
fence
where
she
saw
one
of
biglin
negroes
dodging
about
and
evidently
trying
to
catch
the
eye
of
his
master
without
attracting
the
attention
of
anyone
else
in
the
yard
the
circumstance
increased
her
suspicions
but
she
said
very
calmly
your
boy
bill
is
out
there
in
the
road
biglin
and
i
think
he
wants
to
tell
you
something
then
why
do
he
come
in
replied
the
planter
he
has
been
down
in
the
woods
trying
to
locate
a
small
drove
of
my
hogs
and
perhaps
he
has
found
them
and
perhaps
he
has
found
something
else
was
what
rodney
eyes
and
dick
said
when
they
looked
at
each
other
and
they
could
hardly
conceal
their
agitation
when
they
observed
that
turnbull
was
keeping
her
gaze
fixed
on
their
faces
you
bill
shouted
the
planter
come
here
the
negro
came
very
reluctantly
and
when
he
saw
his
master
turn
about
in
his
chair
and
look
at
him
he
stopped
and
twisted
his
face
into
all
sorts
of
shapes
and
rolled
up
the
whites
of
his
eyes
trying
by
every
means
in
his
power
to
make
his
master
understand
that
he
desired
to
say
a
word
to
him
in
private
well
why
do
you
speak
demanded
biglin
did
you
find
anything
down
there
sah
oh
sah
i
found
sumfin
replied
the
negro
in
a
tone
so
significant
that
biglin
would
have
been
dull
indeed
if
he
had
failed
to
understand
him
this
time
with
the
remark
that
he
had
better
be
getting
along
toward
home
he
arose
and
followed
the
boy
who
promptly
led
the
way
toward
the
front
gate
peculiar
man
that
said
the
lieutenant
rising
from
his
comfortable
couch
on
the
grass
and
stretching
his
arms
he
did
even
bid
us
i
reckon
we
best
be
getting
along
toward
camp
boots
and
saddles
are
you
going
to
give
up
looking
for
those
yankees
inquired
turnbull
and
from
the
bottom
of
his
heart
rodney
thanked
him
for
asking
the
question
he
wanted
to
do
it
himself
but
was
afraid
to
speak
i
reckon
i
might
as
well
answered
the
officer
as
his
men
got
upon
their
feet
aroused
the
slumbering
hounds
by
snapping
their
fingers
at
them
and
hastened
to
obey
the
command
i
did
think
of
taking
in
those
woods
on
my
way
to
mooreville
but
do
suppose
it
would
be
of
any
use
if
the
yanks
were
there
you
two
would
have
been
likely
to
see
them
would
you
he
added
nodding
at
rodney
i
am
quite
sure
we
would
was
the
reply
but
after
all
he
was
not
so
sure
of
it
the
timber
was
thick
and
unless
accompanied
by
dogs
a
whole
regiment
might
have
walked
through
it
without
seeing
any
signs
of
a
fugitive
who
took
the
least
pains
to
conceal
himself
that
what
i
thought
continued
the
lieutenant
and
as
my
men
and
animals
are
somewhat
worn
with
travel
i
think
i
will
give
it
up
and
go
home
i
would
have
captured
those
men
yesterday
if
the
mooreville
home
guards
had
been
worth
their
salt
i
may
have
something
to
say
to
my
colonel
about
it
while
the
lieutenant
talked
he
shook
hands
with
the
planter
and
the
two
boys
lifted
his
cap
to
turnbull
and
thanked
her
for
the
excellent
dinner
she
had
given
his
hungry
men
and
walked
toward
the
place
where
he
had
hitched
his
horse
accompanied
by
their
host
the
latter
wife
remained
behind
and
when
she
saw
the
officer
swing
himself
into
his
saddle
she
made
some
slight
apology
to
dick
and
motioned
rodney
to
follow
her
into
the
house
what
down
there
in
the
woods
behind
our
plantation
were
the
first
words
she
said
to
him
when
they
were
alone
why
turnbull
began
rodney
how
should
i
know
i
assure
you
i
am
at
a
you
know
what
i
mean
rodney
gray
and
you
ca
deceive
me
interrupted
the
lady
with
so
much
earnestness
that
rodney
saw
it
was
useless
to
argue
with
her
you
never
in
your
life
before
came
to
this
house
on
foot
you
were
frightened
when
you
found
the
soldiers
here
you
became
angry
the
moment
biglin
spoke
of
yankees
you
were
frightened
again
when
the
boy
bill
intimated
that
he
had
a
word
to
say
to
his
master
in
private
and
all
aha
you
do
know
what
i
mean
do
you
turnbull
replied
rodney
in
a
husky
voice
they
are
the
men
i
promised
to
help
if
i
could
you
not
betray
them
i
ought
to
scold
you
for
speaking
such
words
to
me
and
some
day
i
will
said
the
lady
hastily
but
just
now
i
want
to
warn
you
against
biglin
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
he
is
not
trustworthy
when
she
ceased
speaking
she
stepped
to
the
window
and
looked
out
she
stood
there
a
moment
and
beckoned
rodney
to
her
side
the
confederate
soldiers
had
disappeared
up
the
road
in
a
cloud
of
dust
and
biglin
was
just
riding
by
the
house
it
was
plain
that
he
was
in
a
hurry
for
he
did
not
stop
to
pick
up
his
hat
which
flew
off
just
as
rodney
caught
sight
of
him
but
dug
his
heels
into
his
mule
sides
in
the
effort
to
make
him
go
faster
he
trying
to
overtake
the
soldiers
gasped
rodney
he
certainly
is
replied
turnbull
calmly
he
will
succeed
too
and
when
he
brings
them
back
with
the
the
yankees
will
burn
him
out
before
he
is
a
week
older
said
rodney
through
his
clenched
teeth
they
will
do
nothing
of
the
sort
unless
you
bear
witness
against
him
and
i
know
you
will
not
do
that
answered
turnbull
but
waste
no
time
in
words
you
know
what
to
do
i
will
say
something
in
your
favor
and
turnbull
as
soon
as
i
can
gain
the
ear
of
the
provost
marshal
said
rodney
and
thank
you
for
the
interest
you
take
in
my
yankee
friends
rodney
made
a
sign
to
dick
as
he
sprang
down
the
steps
and
ran
around
the
corner
of
the
house
and
told
him
his
story
as
they
sped
across
the
field
side
by
side
there
was
one
thing
in
their
favor
he
said
biglin
mule
was
one
of
those
critters
that
gallop
up
and
down
in
one
place
instead
of
going
ahead
and
if
the
confederates
were
moving
with
any
speed
at
all
he
might
not
be
able
to
overtake
them
until
they
had
gone
a
mile
or
two
toward
mooreville
but
he
would
certainly
come
up
with
them
sooner
or
later
and
bring
them
back
and
and
then
they
put
the
hounds
on
the
yanks
trail
exclaimed
dick
finishing
his
sentence
for
him
rodney
you
have
got
yourself
into
the
worst
kind
of
a
scrape
by
helping
those
prisoners
and
how
about
yourself
i
going
to
skip
out
and
go
over
the
river
you
know
but
you
got
to
stay
here
and
face
the
music
the
lieutenant
may
not
be
able
to
set
tom
randolph
cowardly
home
guards
on
to
i
do
believe
he
will
try
but
he
report
the
matter
at
camp
pinckney
and
that
will
be
bad
for
you
the
boys
ran
across
the
field
at
the
top
of
their
speed
and
scaled
the
fence
without
hearing
any
sounds
in
the
direction
of
the
house
to
indicate
that
biglin
had
returned
with
the
soldiers
ten
minutes
later
they
were
challenged
in
a
low
peremptory
tone
that
dick
said
meant
business
comes
there
said
the
corporal
voice
speak
quick
it
all
right
yank
i
do
wonder
you
look
anxious
replied
rodney
as
he
and
dick
made
their
way
through
the
bushes
and
found
the
fugitives
standing
erect
with
their
guns
in
their
hands
come
on
now
there
not
a
second
to
lose
do
you
know
about
that
nigger
inquired
ben
well
sir
he
found
us
all
asleep
and
was
onto
us
before
we
knew
it
we
could
have
captured
him
easy
enough
but
we
never
looked
for
treachery
among
the
darkeys
and
besides
we
did
know
but
you
johnnies
had
sent
him
down
with
a
message
or
something
but
the
minute
we
spoke
and
he
ran
we
knew
there
was
mischief
afoot
of
course
we
were
afraid
to
shoot
him
and
so
he
got
safely
away
did
you
see
him
what
did
he
say
we
did
hear
what
he
said
to
his
master
began
dick
but
you
go
to
the
rear
and
let
me
talk
interrupted
rodney
who
had
forgotten
to
tell
his
friend
that
biglin
name
must
not
be
mentioned
in
the
hearing
of
the
escaped
prisoners
they
would
remember
him
of
course
and
square
accounts
with
him
the
first
time
their
regiment
was
ordered
out
on
a
scout
he
managed
to
tell
some
sort
of
a
tale
without
speaking
of
biglin
but
it
was
not
entirely
satisfactory
to
the
corporal
you
shielding
somebody
johnny
but
if
he
is
a
friend
of
yours
all
right
said
the
latter
what
odds
does
it
make
to
you
so
long
as
you
get
safe
to
the
river
answered
rodney
i
am
shielding
somebody
and
i
do
it
because
turnbull
expects
me
to
that
the
name
of
the
woman
who
lives
in
that
house
and
if
it
had
been
for
her
there
no
telling
what
would
have
happened
bear
that
name
in
and
when
you
are
raiding
through
here
do
steal
so
much
as
a
drink
of
milk
from
that
family
the
corporal
and
his
men
promised
and
said
the
name
over
several
times
to
fix
it
in
their
memory
our
pursuers
are
all
soldiers
continued
rodney
and
under
almost
any
other
circumstances
i
believe
they
would
let
us
off
easy
but
the
way
they
fixed
they
got
to
do
their
duty
or
be
reported
they
are
bound
to
come
back
to
the
house
and
put
out
the
and
they
done
it
said
dick
graham
coming
to
a
sudden
standstill
and
turning
one
ear
toward
the
house
there
do
you
hear
it
all
this
while
the
fugitives
had
been
making
the
best
progress
they
could
through
the
woods
but
now
they
stopped
and
listened
intently
yes
they
could
hear
it
plainly
enough
not
a
single
bugle
note
like
that
which
had
attracted
dick
graham
attention
but
a
whole
chorus
of
eager
yelps
proving
that
all
the
hounds
had
taken
up
the
trail
this
is
going
to
be
the
tightest
squeak
we
had
yet
observed
ben
how
many
of
them
are
there
in
the
party
about
six
hounds
i
should
say
and
twice
as
many
men
replied
rodney
enough
altogether
to
make
running
easier
than
fighting
dick
take
this
bottle
and
do
use
it
until
i
say
the
word
what
in
it
inquired
the
corporal
turpentine
and
if
the
dogs
get
a
good
sniff
of
it
it
will
spoil
their
scenting
powers
for
quite
a
while
the
trouble
is
it
evaporates
quickly
and
dick
must
use
it
until
the
hounds
are
close
to
us
dick
fell
back
to
the
rear
and
rodney
set
off
on
a
keen
run
directing
his
course
toward
a
little
bayou
which
he
knew
he
would
find
a
mile
or
so
in
advance
but
fast
as
they
went
the
hounds
came
on
at
a
swifter
pace
their
sonorous
yelps
grew
louder
every
minute
and
presently
the
encouraging
shouts
of
the
soldiers
mingled
with
them
oh
do
i
wish
i
had
enlisted
in
the
infantry
puffed
ben
who
followed
close
at
rodney
heels
such
a
tramp
as
we
have
had
be
anything
to
a
foot
soldier
but
it
death
on
a
cavalryman
the
hounds
are
now
following
dick
trail
and
mine
across
the
field
said
rodney
they
come
on
faster
when
they
pick
up
yours
for
they
will
recognize
it
on
the
instant
and
so
it
proved
the
hounds
gradually
swept
around
from
a
point
to
the
rear
and
left
of
them
to
another
that
was
directly
behind
and
then
their
loud
baying
increased
wonderfully
in
volume
they
had
at
last
found
the
trail
that
had
been
lost
to
them
for
so
many
hours
and
were
holding
a
jubilee
over
it
after
that
the
horsemen
were
distanced
but
the
active
hounds
came
on
with
undiminished
speed
and
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
could
be
heard
making
their
way
through
the
bushes
close
behind
the
prisoners
began
to
wonder
if
it
was
about
time
for
dick
graham
to
use
the
contents
of
his
bottle
when
their
guide
parted
the
thicket
in
front
of
him
and
halted
for
an
instant
on
the
bank
of
the
bayou
for
which
he
had
been
heading
put
half
of
it
right
here
and
the
rest
on
the
opposite
bank
forward
the
rest
of
us
said
he
and
with
the
words
he
dashed
through
the
narrow
stream
and
into
the
bushes
on
the
other
side
illustration
dick
baffles
the
bloodhounds
dick
graham
showed
no
little
nerve
in
carrying
out
his
instructions
when
his
companions
disappeared
he
pulled
the
bottle
of
turpentine
from
his
pocket
but
knowing
the
volatile
nature
of
the
fluid
he
seemed
to
be
in
no
haste
to
use
it
until
the
leading
hound
was
so
close
upon
him
that
he
could
hear
his
labored
breathing
then
he
dug
the
heels
of
his
shoes
into
the
soft
earth
and
filled
the
depressions
with
turpentine
ten
seconds
later
he
stood
on
the
other
side
of
the
bayou
filling
other
footprints
with
what
was
left
in
the
bottle
and
just
as
the
foremost
of
his
fourfooted
pursuers
appeared
in
sight
he
flung
himself
into
the
bushes
but
he
was
not
prepared
for
what
followed
as
fast
as
the
hounds
arrived
upon
the
bank
they
smelt
at
the
turpentine
and
backed
away
with
a
sneeze
and
when
they
were
all
in
plain
view
running
about
with
their
heads
in
the
air
or
going
through
such
contortions
as
dogs
will
when
they
unexpectedly
encounter
something
disagreeable
a
deafening
roar
rang
through
the
woods
and
every
one
of
the
hounds
dropped
in
his
tracks
dead
or
wounded
the
union
soldiers
were
not
going
to
be
tracked
like
beasts
or
criminals
any
longer
chapter
xv
rodney
passes
inspection
this
was
the
first
and
last
adventure
that
befell
rodney
gray
and
his
party
while
they
were
on
their
way
to
baton
rouge
the
shooting
of
the
hounds
broke
the
backbone
of
the
pursuit
as
dick
graham
expressed
it
although
it
did
not
put
a
stop
to
it
altogether
the
rebels
raised
a
chorus
of
angry
yells
when
they
reached
the
bank
of
the
bayou
and
discovered
their
fourfooted
allies
weltering
in
their
blood
and
fired
their
guns
at
random
into
the
woods
in
the
direction
the
fugitives
had
gone
but
they
made
no
energetic
effort
to
continue
the
chase
after
that
and
this
went
far
to
confirm
rodney
in
his
belief
that
the
lieutenant
would
not
have
put
the
hounds
on
the
trail
at
all
if
it
had
been
for
biglin
by
expressing
this
opinion
aloud
he
could
have
made
biglin
a
beggar
before
another
week
passed
over
his
head
contrary
to
his
original
plan
rodney
kept
his
party
moving
until
late
that
afternoon
when
he
halted
the
soldiers
in
the
rear
of
another
plantation
while
he
and
dick
went
to
the
house
to
get
something
to
eat
and
make
inquiries
concerning
their
pursuers
this
time
they
were
not
gone
more
than
half
an
hour
and
when
they
returned
they
were
accompanied
by
the
owner
of
the
plantation
who
cordially
invited
the
soldiers
into
the
house
it
all
right
boys
rodney
assured
them
our
friends
from
camp
pinckney
have
been
this
far
down
the
road
banks
is
union
and
a
large
squad
of
your
cavalry
has
just
gone
back
into
the
country
so
that
they
are
between
us
and
the
rebels
why
rodney
said
banks
you
a
rebel
yourself
i
was
and
i
do
know
but
i
am
yet
but
i
am
not
fighting
any
yanks
just
now
was
the
smiling
reply
come
along
boys
and
after
we
have
eaten
everything
banks
has
to
spare
we
take
to
the
road
and
follow
it
as
though
we
had
a
right
there
we
done
hiding
now
the
corporal
glanced
at
the
military
pass
which
banks
produced
to
prove
that
he
was
all
right
with
the
federal
authorities
in
baton
rouge
and
gladly
accepted
his
invitation
and
for
fear
that
he
might
forget
it
he
drew
one
of
those
useless
paroles
from
his
pocket
and
wrote
banks
name
and
turnbull
upon
it
that
as
strong
a
promise
of
protection
as
a
officer
can
give
said
he
it
will
hold
good
with
my
regiment
any
way
the
four
prisoners
splashed
a
good
deal
of
water
at
the
horse
trough
before
they
would
consent
to
enter
the
house
and
sit
down
to
the
table
like
white
folks
but
when
they
got
there
they
did
ample
justice
to
the
substantial
food
that
was
placed
before
them
the
planter
apologized
for
the
absence
of
salt
on
the
table
by
saying
that
he
had
been
able
to
obtain
a
permit
to
bring
it
through
the
lines
then
smuggle
it
suggested
the
corporal
buy
a
barrel
of
flour
and
chuck
a
bag
of
salt
inside
of
it
but
do
let
your
best
friend
see
you
do
it
chimed
in
rodney
that
the
warning
my
father
received
there
are
lots
of
traitors
in
the
city
who
try
to
curry
favor
with
the
yanks
by
carrying
tales
about
their
old
neighbors
by
the
way
do
you
want
me
to
get
you
a
barrel
of
flour
the
expression
of
astonishment
that
came
upon
banks
face
set
the
table
in
a
roar
you
did
expect
me
to
speak
so
freely
in
the
presence
of
these
boys
i
suppose
continued
rodney
you
need
be
afraid
for
they
are
not
on
duty
now
besides
they
are
soldiers
and
rather
trust
them
than
some
civilians
i
know
of
how
will
you
bring
the
flour
out
asked
banks
i
bring
it
out
answered
rodney
confidently
in
the
first
place
i
ask
for
a
pass
for
inland
travel
and
a
permit
to
trade
and
i
am
bound
to
get
both
i
know
where
i
can
borrow
a
team
in
the
city
and
i
intend
to
bring
it
out
loaded
i
know
that
salt
and
all
munitions
of
war
are
contraband
and
that
there
is
an
inspection
of
all
persons
and
property
going
in
or
out
of
the
lines
but
i
shall
be
back
this
way
or
next
day
and
if
you
want
a
bag
of
salt
for
your
table
you
can
have
it
well
i
snum
said
the
planter
admiringly
your
war
experience
has
done
a
heap
for
you
rodney
he
had
the
reputation
of
being
the
best
forager
in
the
regiment
said
dick
i
known
him
to
stick
a
pig
and
clean
him
and
bring
him
into
camp
under
daddy
price
nose
when
the
orders
were
strict
that
such
things
should
be
done
if
there
was
anything
to
eat
in
the
country
our
mess
always
lived
well
dinner
over
rodney
led
his
party
out
of
the
house
and
into
the
woods
again
but
it
was
done
merely
to
mislead
any
talkative
rebel
or
treacherous
darkey
who
might
be
on
the
watch
it
would
do
to
let
all
the
neighbors
know
that
banks
had
sheltered
some
escaped
prisoners
in
his
house
during
the
night
but
when
darkness
came
they
left
the
woods
and
found
in
one
of
the
negro
cabins
beds
that
had
been
placed
there
on
purpose
for
them
and
on
which
they
slept
the
sleep
of
the
weary
daylight
the
next
morning
found
them
well
on
their
way
toward
the
city
with
a
breakfast
under
their
belts
and
a
big
lunch
in
their
pockets
there
was
more
travel
on
the
road
than
rodney
expected
to
see
and
the
number
of
teams
that
were
constantly
going
and
coming
gave
him
some
idea
of
the
amount
of
traffic
carried
on
between
the
invaders
and
the
country
people
when
he
and
his
companions
were
halted
by
the
first
pickets
a
few
miles
outside
the
city
they
told
as
much
of
their
story
as
they
thought
necessary
and
demanded
to
be
taken
before
colonel
baker
commanding
the
michigan
cavalry
in
order
to
avoid
delay
and
the
trouble
of
answering
the
thousand
and
one
questions
propounded
by
the
inexperienced
officer
who
responded
to
the
picket
call
the
corporal
who
did
the
talking
said
that
they
were
all
escaped
prisoners
but
when
they
reached
the
place
where
the
michigan
were
encamped
and
walked
down
the
street
toward
the
quarters
that
story
would
no
longer
pass
muster
for
the
corporal
was
recognized
by
his
comrades
who
crowded
about
him
from
all
sides
the
news
of
that
fight
near
camp
pinckney
had
been
brought
in
by
a
farmer
who
affirmed
that
all
the
yankees
had
been
killed
by
the
home
guards
as
fast
as
they
surrendered
and
as
a
consequence
the
michigan
boys
had
given
up
all
hope
of
seeing
their
friends
again
their
commanding
officer
greeted
them
in
the
same
cordial
way
laughed
over
the
paroles
which
the
corporal
gave
him
took
down
the
names
of
the
union
people
as
they
were
read
off
looked
at
rodney
discharge
and
dick
and
told
the
corporal
to
show
them
the
way
to
the
provost
marshal
office
but
colonel
these
boys
who
have
stood
by
us
as
though
they
belonged
to
us
want
a
pass
and
a
permit
to
trade
said
the
corporal
and
if
you
will
allow
me
to
use
your
name
perhaps
the
provost
will
be
more
willing
to
grant
the
favor
the
permission
was
readily
given
and
the
colonel
name
must
have
had
some
weight
with
the
marshal
for
he
did
not
detain
rodney
and
dick
at
his
office
on
business
for
more
than
ten
minutes
but
he
kept
them
there
talking
in
a
friendly
way
for
more
than
an
hour
when
he
handed
them
the
papers
they
wanted
he
took
pains
to
say
that
there
were
some
things
that
could
not
be
taken
through
the
lines
under
any
circumstances
whatever
and
then
he
asked
where
they
intended
to
make
their
headquarters
when
they
were
in
the
city
and
whether
or
not
they
had
any
cotton
to
sell
as
rodney
did
not
know
what
his
object
might
be
in
asking
this
question
he
answered
it
evasively
i
wish
i
owned
bales
and
that
it
was
in
the
northern
market
at
this
minute
said
he
it
is
worth
sixty
cents
a
pound
up
there
because
if
you
got
any
you
may
as
well
understand
that
it
do
you
much
good
said
the
marshal
that
is
unless
you
sharp
the
richmond
government
is
going
to
buy
or
steal
all
the
cotton
in
the
confederacy
and
make
it
the
basis
of
a
foreign
loan
and
of
course
you
yanks
are
going
to
stop
that
sort
of
work
by
destroying
every
bale
you
can
find
said
rodney
i
understand
that
but
i
do
know
what
you
mean
by
being
sharp
you
do
get
the
papers
very
often
do
you
said
the
captain
well
take
those
when
you
go
they
old
but
perhaps
their
contents
will
be
news
to
you
you
will
find
that
they
say
something
about
a
trade
that
is
to
be
established
between
northern
men
who
are
to
have
permits
to
trade
inside
our
lines
and
southern
people
does
that
hit
you
anything
to
cripple
the
rebs
you
know
and
you
will
see
something
about
the
ram
in
there
too
it
was
a
brave
act
if
it
was
performed
by
the
enemies
of
my
country
what
about
her
what
did
she
do
inquired
rodney
who
had
heard
vague
reports
that
there
was
such
a
vessel
as
the
and
that
great
things
were
expected
of
her
by
her
confederate
builders
why
you
know
that
the
navy
has
been
keeping
up
a
regular
bombardment
of
vicksburg
do
you
i
tell
you
the
pluck
of
the
johnnies
up
there
is
something
wonderful
said
the
captain
and
rodney
and
dick
disgusted
as
they
were
with
the
policy
of
the
richmond
government
felt
a
thrill
of
pride
as
they
listened
to
his
words
they
think
the
lower
river
was
given
up
too
easily
and
are
going
to
make
a
fight
for
their
city
and
when
farragut
passed
their
batteries
on
the
of
june
and
our
shells
were
falling
like
hail
in
the
streets
parties
of
ladies
were
seen
on
the
court
house
and
in
other
conspicuous
places
waving
handkerchiefs
and
little
rebel
flags
to
encourage
their
husbands
and
brothers
and
sons
who
were
fighting
the
guns
below
them
well
when
farragut
joined
davis
above
the
city
they
sent
an
expedition
up
the
yazoo
to
find
this
ram
and
destroy
her
but
before
they
were
fairly
started
they
met
the
coming
down
and
did
they
capture
her
exclaimed
dick
no
i
am
sorry
to
say
she
either
disabled
or
dodged
the
three
gunboats
composing
the
expedition
came
out
of
the
yazoo
with
flying
colors
ran
through
both
fleets
and
took
shelter
under
the
guns
of
vicksburg
and
she
there
now
in
spite
of
two
desperate
attempts
that
were
made
to
destroy
her
sorry
aint
you
i
ca
honestly
say
that
i
am
answered
rodney
who
had
already
made
up
his
mind
that
the
talkative
provost
marshal
was
willing
to
be
friendly
to
any
confederate
who
had
laid
down
his
arms
a
brave
act
like
that
ought
to
be
successful
then
our
attempts
to
destroy
her
ought
to
have
been
successful
for
they
were
equally
brave
retorted
the
captain
she
got
pretty
well
hammered
while
passing
through
the
two
fleets
and
report
says
that
as
soon
as
she
is
repaired
she
is
coming
down
to
take
baton
rouge
from
us
but
she
is
as
far
down
as
she
will
ever
get
farragut
is
here
now
with
his
whole
fleet
and
this
is
a
good
place
to
say
a
word
or
two
more
about
the
situation
at
baton
rouge
so
that
some
events
which
we
have
yet
to
record
may
be
made
perfectly
plain
on
the
of
the
month
july
davis
made
another
attempt
to
destroy
the
but
it
resulted
in
failure
two
of
his
boats
the
and
of
the
were
commanded
to
go
down
and
sink
her
as
she
lay
at
her
moorings
under
cover
of
the
confederate
batteries
but
her
picked
crew
fought
as
bravely
and
skilfully
now
as
they
had
done
a
week
before
the
ran
aground
and
remained
there
for
ten
minutes
under
fire
so
hot
that
it
is
a
wonder
she
was
not
cut
all
to
pieces
but
she
finally
worked
off
and
ran
down
to
join
farragut
while
the
of
the
struggled
back
up
the
river
to
report
the
failure
to
davis
the
situation
at
this
time
was
discouraging
to
our
side
the
gunboats
were
widely
separated
the
canal
that
was
to
make
vicksburg
an
inland
town
proved
a
failure
general
williams
removed
to
baton
rouge
the
small
body
of
troops
with
which
he
had
been
with
the
naval
forces
commodore
davis
went
back
to
the
mouth
of
the
yazoo
and
anchored
there
and
for
full
five
months
there
was
a
lull
in
the
operations
against
vicksburg
but
exciting
things
continued
to
happen
in
rodney
gray
part
of
the
country
to
tell
you
the
truth
we
of
the
army
of
the
centre
always
found
more
reliable
information
in
your
papers
than
we
did
in
our
own
and
i
suppose
that
these
you
have
kindly
given
me
will
tell
us
all
about
the
doings
on
the
river
said
rodney
continuing
the
conversation
we
have
broken
off
but
i
want
to
ask
you
one
question
before
i
go
my
friend
dick
wants
to
go
to
little
rock
how
is
he
going
to
get
there
i
give
it
up
replied
the
captain
do
you
think
the
commanding
naval
officer
would
permit
him
to
cross
the
river
if
he
showed
his
discharge
he
might
and
then
he
might
not
i
ca
say
those
navy
men
are
fine
fellows
the
finest
i
think
i
ever
saw
but
they
so
particular
that
if
i
wanted
to
go
to
little
rock
and
if
it
was
right
that
i
should
go
i
would
believe
i
just
go
that
all
well
we
will
no
longer
trespass
upon
your
time
said
rodney
getting
upon
his
feet
we
are
obliged
to
you
for
your
kindness
and
courtesy
and
if
you
ever
come
out
our
way
drop
in
and
see
us
i
should
be
glad
if
i
could
accept
half
the
invitations
that
have
been
given
me
by
people
hereabout
replied
the
captain
but
just
now
i
ca
any
rebs
out
your
way
i
do
expect
you
to
come
without
an
escort
there
are
soldiers
at
camp
pinckney
and
some
of
them
have
been
seen
in
mooreville
if
you
must
go
and
remember
that
there
are
a
few
things
which
that
permit
does
not
authorize
you
to
take
through
the
lines
rodney
said
he
would
not
forget
it
and
then
he
and
dick
saluted
and
went
into
the
outer
room
which
was
filled
with
civilians
and
soldiers
awaiting
an
audience
with
the
provost
marshal
after
looking
in
vain
for
the
corporal
they
concluded
that
he
had
returned
to
camp
so
they
took
the
nearest
way
to
the
home
of
martin
the
gentleman
under
whose
hospitable
roof
rodney
and
his
father
were
sojourning
on
the
night
that
ned
griffin
rode
in
from
mooreville
with
the
information
that
drummond
and
tom
randolph
were
laying
plans
to
have
rodney
arrested
when
he
reached
louis
martin
was
glad
to
see
them
and
made
them
feel
at
home
at
once
he
laughed
when
they
told
him
of
their
interview
with
the
provost
marshal
and
when
rodney
declared
that
he
like
to
see
anybody
treated
with
so
much
civility
by
an
officer
holding
that
position
in
bragg
army
cautioned
them
to
be
careful
how
they
trespassed
upon
the
captain
good
nature
the
latter
was
cordial
and
friendly
with
everyone
who
had
business
with
him
but
he
had
a
reputation
as
a
fighter
had
won
all
his
promotions
by
his
bravery
on
the
field
of
battle
and
had
no
mercy
on
civilians
or
soldiers
who
were
caught
disobeying
his
orders
but
smuggling
things
out
of
the
lines
is
like
foraging
in
the
army
said
martin
in
conclusion
the
sin
lies
in
being
detected
that
all
i
want
to
know
said
rodney
i
never
been
caught
yet
you
can
tell
me
where
i
can
borrow
or
hire
a
team
i
suppose
yes
the
host
could
do
that
and
he
might
also
be
able
to
make
a
few
suggestions
that
would
be
of
use
to
them
but
he
did
see
how
dick
would
get
over
the
river
unless
he
acted
upon
the
provost
advice
and
just
went
however
he
said
after
a
moment
reflection
i
will
introduce
you
to
our
mail
carrier
if
he
will
let
me
do
we
have
a
mail
carried
back
and
forth
under
the
noses
of
these
gunboats
exclaimed
dick
i
do
know
how
or
where
it
goes
but
we
certainly
have
communication
with
the
opposite
shore
the
service
was
very
irregular
while
general
williams
was
at
vicksburg
but
since
he
came
back
to
baton
rouge
our
mail
reaches
us
at
shorter
intervals
so
i
imagine
it
is
carried
across
at
some
point
up
the
river
and
brought
down
through
the
country
i
do
know
but
i
meet
the
mail
carrier
once
in
a
while
and
can
you
make
it
convenient
to
say
a
word
to
him
about
dick
i
can
and
will
but
i
must
tell
you
now
that
there
is
one
thing
that
will
operate
against
you
you
told
the
provost
marshal
that
you
would
make
your
headquarters
at
my
house
as
often
as
you
came
to
town
and
he
knows
me
to
be
a
southern
sympathizer
whew
whistled
rodney
while
dick
looked
frightened
martin
we
will
never
come
near
your
house
again
oh
yes
you
will
replied
their
host
but
you
must
be
careful
how
you
act
and
who
you
talk
to
the
city
is
full
of
the
meanest
sort
of
converted
rebels
who
are
harder
on
us
than
the
yankees
if
martin
goes
out
shopping
or
receives
a
guest
oftener
than
once
a
week
they
run
to
the
marshal
with
the
news
and
i
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
my
premises
are
being
watched
for
spies
they
are
a
contemptible
lot
declared
dick
and
if
the
provost
marshal
was
the
gentleman
we
took
him
for
he
would
not
pay
the
least
heed
to
their
reports
all
fair
in
war
said
the
host
these
converted
rebels
are
working
for
trade
permits
there
going
to
be
a
lot
of
money
made
in
cotton
one
of
these
days
and
they
want
some
of
it
while
in
the
city
you
may
listen
all
you
please
but
do
make
a
confidant
of
anybody
but
me
and
do
have
too
much
to
say
to
those
four
escaped
prisoners
you
may
run
across
them
some
time
when
they
are
on
duty
martin
talked
for
half
an
hour
in
this
strain
dropping
hints
here
and
there
which
proved
to
be
of
great
service
to
rodney
and
then
he
conducted
the
boys
to
a
clothing
store
and
left
them
to
make
their
purchases
while
he
went
out
to
look
for
a
team
before
they
went
to
bed
that
night
their
business
was
all
done
and
all
that
remained
for
them
to
do
in
the
morning
was
to
load
the
wagon
their
host
had
provided
for
them
and
go
home
martin
obtained
from
rodney
a
list
of
needed
goods
principally
groceries
which
he
purchased
and
packed
himself
and
when
the
various
boxes
barrels
and
bags
that
comprised
his
load
were
afterward
unpacked
at
his
father
door
rodney
found
in
them
many
little
articles
which
he
was
sure
he
had
not
placed
on
that
list
they
made
an
early
start
and
rodney
parting
injunction
to
martin
was
to
seek
an
interview
with
the
mail
carrier
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
for
dick
was
impatient
to
be
on
his
way
home
this
is
my
first
work
as
an
overseer
said
rodney
when
the
city
was
left
behind
and
the
two
scraggy
mules
that
pulled
the
wagon
had
been
coaxed
and
thrashed
into
a
snail
trot
and
i
think
i
have
made
a
very
fair
beginning
seeing
that
the
business
is
new
to
me
my
next
task
will
be
to
see
you
over
the
river
i
never
knew
you
were
an
overseer
said
dick
i
called
myself
one
ever
since
i
had
that
talk
with
my
father
on
the
night
we
came
home
answered
rodney
and
just
see
what
i
shall
have
to
do
when
you
are
gone
i
battled
for
fame
and
did
get
it
and
now
i
am
going
to
work
for
dollars
and
see
if
i
will
have
any
better
luck
dick
i
am
just
aching
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
one
of
those
is
a
yankee
trader
not
one
of
those
converted
rebels
martin
told
us
of
shall
touch
a
bale
of
our
cotton
if
i
have
to
fight
to
keep
him
away
from
it
but
if
some
good
yankee
comes
along
and
offers
sixty
cents
a
pound
for
it
you
just
wait
and
see
how
hard
i
will
work
to
put
it
in
his
hands
it
was
plain
that
rodney
gray
belonged
to
the
class
who
were
denounced
by
pollard
the
southern
historian
as
unpatriotic
planters
in
writing
of
this
very
matter
pollard
said
the
country
had
taken
a
solemn
resolution
to
burn
the
cotton
in
advance
of
the
enemy
but
the
conflagration
of
this
staple
became
a
rare
event
instead
of
being
committed
to
the
flames
it
was
spirited
away
to
yankee
markets
the
planters
of
the
extreme
south
who
prior
to
the
war
were
loudest
for
secession
were
known
to
buy
every
article
of
their
consumption
from
the
invading
army
nor
were
these
operations
always
disguised
some
commercial
houses
in
the
confederacy
counted
their
gains
by
millions
of
dollars
through
the
favor
of
the
government
in
allowing
them
to
export
cotton
at
pleasure
but
rodney
gray
was
a
private
individual
and
he
was
well
aware
that
if
his
father
cotton
brought
the
money
it
was
really
worth
it
would
take
some
good
scheming
on
his
part
about
an
hour
after
the
boys
left
the
city
they
came
upon
the
first
picket
post
which
they
found
to
be
an
unusually
strong
one
being
composed
of
one
sergeant
two
corporals
and
eight
or
nine
privates
rodney
had
just
time
to
remark
we
pass
inspection
here
probably
when
one
of
the
soldiers
walked
to
the
middle
of
the
road
brought
his
musket
to
arms
port
and
commanded
them
to
halt
an
instant
afterward
their
wagon
was
surrounded
by
the
rest
of
the
pickets
who
shook
the
barrels
back
and
forth
dug
their
fingers
into
the
bags
and
bumped
the
boxes
about
in
the
most
unceremonious
style
got
a
permit
demanded
the
sergeant
and
a
pass
he
did
not
ask
who
the
boys
were
or
where
they
came
from
and
the
sequel
proved
that
he
knew
without
asking
these
documents
appear
to
be
all
right
he
continued
after
he
had
read
the
papers
rodney
handed
out
discharged
rebels
eh
you
seem
to
be
such
a
desperate
looking
couple
what
you
got
in
your
wagon
munitions
of
war
replied
rodney
there
a
in
one
of
those
barrels
that
what
i
thought
get
out
both
of
you
although
the
boys
were
surprised
and
startled
by
this
unexpected
command
they
were
prompt
to
obey
it
now
let
me
see
what
you
got
in
your
pockets
said
the
sergeant
every
scrap
mind
you
you
welcome
to
read
all
the
letters
and
things
of
that
sort
you
can
find
about
us
answered
rodney
we
are
not
simple
enough
to
lose
our
permits
and
passes
by
carrying
despatches
the
first
thing
they
the
who
helped
the
michigan
boys
observed
a
corporal
i
know
but
business
is
business
said
the
sergeant
and
been
in
martin
company
ever
since
they
came
to
town
that
all
right
i
do
object
to
your
doing
your
duty
for
been
a
soldier
myself
said
rodney
but
i
do
object
to
being
taken
for
a
plumb
dunce
you
find
no
writing
about
us
except
the
papers
we
showed
you
and
our
discharges
but
the
sergeant
obeyed
orders
like
the
good
soldier
he
was
and
it
was
not
until
he
had
seen
all
their
pockets
turned
inside
out
and
had
felt
of
the
seams
of
their
coats
and
trousers
that
he
concluded
they
were
all
right
and
could
pass
on
he
did
not
say
a
word
about
the
things
they
had
in
the
wagon
he
was
after
despatches
and
nothing
else
climb
in
and
go
ahead
johnny
said
the
sergeant
giving
rodney
a
friendly
slap
to
help
him
along
and
when
you
see
that
best
girl
of
yours
give
her
my
regards
and
say
that
i
am
coming
out
to
call
on
her
one
of
these
days
well
be
sure
and
come
in
a
crowd
you
see
fun
if
you
do
any
graybacks
out
your
way
some
and
the
events
of
the
last
few
hours
will
probably
bring
more
boys
and
look
out
for
the
rebs
in
vicksburg
they
are
coming
down
to
clean
you
out
he
was
answered
by
shouts
of
laughter
and
derision
from
the
federals
who
advised
him
not
to
take
a
hand
in
the
business
for
he
would
be
whipped
if
he
did
he
drove
on
glad
to
escape
so
easily
and
in
due
time
turned
up
at
turnbull
house
where
he
and
dick
rested
the
balance
of
the
day
and
slept
that
night
when
it
was
dark
a
barrel
of
flour
was
taken
from
the
wagon
and
carried
into
dining
room
and
when
some
of
the
flour
had
been
taken
out
four
bags
of
salt
were
brought
to
light
if
those
little
bags
had
been
filled
with
money
turnbull
and
his
wife
could
scarcely
have
expressed
more
joy
we
been
seasoning
our
food
with
the
floor
of
the
for
the
last
two
months
said
the
former
and
i
tell
you
i
am
glad
to
see
some
clean
salt
once
more
you
have
made
us
your
everlasting
debtors
how
much
did
it
cost
you
i
did
get
an
itemized
bill
replied
rodney
take
it
to
pay
for
our
grub
and
lodging
the
next
night
saw
them
safe
at
home
and
the
night
following
found
them
settled
on
gray
upper
plantation
which
was
located
a
mile
or
two
up
the
river
from
the
one
on
which
ned
griffin
was
living
as
overseer
rodney
was
elated
over
the
result
of
his
first
visit
to
the
city
for
the
immediate
wants
of
the
family
had
been
abundantly
supplied
by
that
of
goods
and
he
and
dick
could
now
wear
clothes
that
looked
as
though
they
fitted
somewhere
but
his
father
and
mother
were
not
elated
they
looked
serious
and
rodney
told
dick
that
he
made
a
mistake
when
he
described
how
carefully
the
federal
soldiers
searched
them
for
despatches
and
it
is
a
bad
thing
for
you
that
they
know
we
make
our
headquarters
at
martin
he
added
they
got
an
eye
on
him
and
what
will
you
bet
that
they
do
know
he
sees
that
mail
carrier
once
in
a
while
then
what
the
reason
they
do
arrest
him
and
the
mail
carrier
too
said
dick
they
jump
down
on
the
pair
of
them
when
they
are
good
and
ready
and
think
they
can
capture
some
important
documents
by
doing
it
answered
rodney
you
ca
cross
at
baton
rouge
you
have
to
start
from
some
point
up
the
river
but
we
see
the
mail
carrier
if
we
can
and
hear
what
he
has
to
say
about
it
chapter

captain
randolph
receives
orders
rodney
gray
was
an
overseer
now
at
all
events
and
being
one
of
those
uneasy
fellows
who
must
have
something
to
occupy
their
minds
at
all
times
and
fond
of
hunting
he
would
have
been
as
happy
and
contented
as
he
wanted
to
be
if
there
had
been
no
such
things
as
home
guards
in
the
world
the
yankees
at
baton
rouge
he
did
not
bother
his
head
about
he
had
charge
of
acres
of
land
of
which
were
under
cultivation
and
fifteen
work
enough
to
bring
him
under
the
exemption
clause
of
the
conscription
act
for
the
privilege
of
staying
at
home
and
overseeing
these
hands
the
confederate
government
demanded
of
him
pounds
of
salt
pork
and
beef
or
their
equivalent
in
bacon
and
rodney
expected
to
furnish
the
meat
himself
there
were
many
hogs
running
loose
in
the
woods
and
as
the
negro
driver
who
had
charge
of
the
plantation
previous
to
rodney
coming
had
taken
no
pains
to
tame
them
by
feeding
them
regularly
they
were
as
wild
as
deer
and
rodney
intended
to
hunt
them
as
he
would
have
hunted
with
rifle
and
with
hounds
the
great
house
in
which
rodney
lived
was
very
unlike
the
same
dwelling
on
the
home
plantation
it
was
built
of
unhewn
logs
and
contained
two
rooms
the
wide
hall
between
them
being
used
as
the
dining
room
both
summer
and
winter
the
kitchen
which
stood
a
little
distance
away
was
built
of
logs
and
so
were
the
negro
cabins
smoke
houses
and
the
little
stable
in
which
his
riding
horse
would
find
shelter
in
stormy
weather
but
taken
as
it
stood
the
plantation
was
a
valuable
one
for
concealed
somewhere
in
the
dark
recesses
of
the
woods
that
hemmed
the
cultivated
fields
in
on
all
sides
were
several
hundred
bales
of
cotton
that
was
worth
sixty
cents
a
pound
in
northern
markets
the
driver
had
been
so
careless
with
his
work
and
so
lax
with
the
hands
that
rodney
found
plenty
of
things
demanding
his
attention
but
he
could
not
think
of
settling
down
to
business
so
long
as
dick
remained
with
him
when
they
parted
it
might
be
forever
and
rodney
was
reluctant
to
let
him
go
martin
told
them
that
they
need
not
come
to
the
city
under
a
week
expecting
to
hear
any
news
from
the
mail
carrier
but
they
did
not
wait
as
long
as
that
without
hearing
news
from
another
source
and
of
the
most
exciting
character
too
on
the
morning
of
the
third
day
after
their
arrival
at
the
plantation
dick
looked
over
rodney
shoulder
as
they
sat
at
the
breakfast
table
in
the
wide
hall
and
saw
half
a
dozen
armed
men
ride
up
to
the
bars
they
stood
there
a
minute
or
two
looking
up
and
down
the
road
and
then
three
of
them
dismounted
and
came
into
the
yard
at
the
same
instant
another
similar
squad
came
in
sight
and
also
rode
up
and
stopped
at
the
bars
rebs
for
a
dollar
whispered
dick
and
not
home
guards
either
replied
rodney
as
the
two
arose
from
the
table
and
walked
out
to
meet
the
visitors
they
are
strangers
well
said
the
foremost
who
might
have
been
an
officer
though
there
was
nothing
on
his
coat
to
show
it
how
does
it
come
that
a
couple
of
likely
lads
like
yourselves
are
here
in
citizen
clothes
while
everybody
else
is
in
the
army
been
there
and
came
home
to
take
a
little
rest
answered
rodney
feeling
in
his
pocket
for
his
discharge
but
everybody
else
is
in
the
army
by
a
long
shot
as
you
would
know
if
you
belonged
in
this
country
read
that
and
tell
me
if
you
are
out
conscripting
we
out
for
more
serious
business
than
that
replied
the
soldier
reading
the
discharges
one
after
the
other
and
handing
them
back
to
their
owners
any
yanks
about
here
none
nearer
than
baton
rouge
that
we
know
of
how
large
an
army
have
they
got
there
the
boys
were
obliged
to
say
they
could
tell
but
they
knew
that
general
williams
had
come
down
from
vicksburg
with
his
whole
force
we
know
that
too
and
are
following
him
up
to
lick
him
we
do
know
how
to
give
an
idea
in
words
of
the
exclamation
that
broke
from
dick
graham
lips
when
he
heard
this
it
was
the
famous
rebel
yell
long
loud
and
piercing
and
when
the
soldiers
at
the
bars
heard
it
they
turned
in
their
saddles
and
lifted
their
hats
and
needed
no
other
evidence
to
prove
that
dick
was
or
had
been
one
of
themselves
then
dick
demanded
if
there
was
going
to
be
a
fight
right
there
in
his
friend
it
happen
somewhere
about
here
replied
the
soldier
better
find
guns
you
two
and
join
in
it
bound
to
be
a
victory
for
our
side
and
you
want
to
share
in
the
honor
we
going
to
have
the
to
help
us
and
she
is
a
match
for
all
the
vessels
the
yanks
have
in
the
river
she
proved
it
by
what
she
did
up
at
yazoo
after
a
little
more
conversation
the
boys
learned
that
their
visitor
belonged
to
breckenridge
division
which
had
been
detached
from
the
force
at
vicksburg
as
soon
as
general
williams
withdrew
and
farragut
started
down
the
river
and
they
were
simply
scouting
in
advance
of
the
main
body
which
was
to
be
reinforced
by
all
the
conscripts
and
regular
troops
at
camp
pinckney
if
you
want
help
why
do
you
bring
into
your
ranks
all
the
home
guards
around
here
said
rodney
are
there
home
guards
about
here
i
am
glad
to
know
it
for
we
need
all
the
help
we
can
raise
who
their
captain
and
where
are
his
headquarters
rodney
gave
the
desired
information
adding
that
if
his
visitor
did
not
think
it
safe
to
venture
as
far
as
mooreville
with
the
small
force
at
his
command
he
and
dick
would
volunteer
to
take
a
message
to
captain
randolph
but
you
will
have
to
put
it
in
writing
said
he
for
tom
will
not
believe
us
and
you
must
caution
him
against
letting
his
men
know
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
fight
for
if
they
find
that
out
they
scatter
like
rats
in
a
pantry
like
home
guards
everywhere
replied
the
soldier
in
disgust
tell
you
what
i
do
said
he
after
thinking
a
moment
i
get
a
line
from
the
colonel
commanding
our
advance
ordering
captain
randolph
to
hold
his
company
in
readiness
to
march
at
a
moment
notice
and
i
either
bring
or
send
it
here
if
you
will
deliver
it
of
course
you
not
say
anything
to
him
or
anybody
else
that
will
get
to
the
enemy
ears
oh
you
need
think
to
surprise
the
yanks
exclaimed
dick
they
have
had
notice
already
that
you
are
coming
but
we
get
tom
out
if
we
can
the
soldier
asked
a
few
more
questions
that
the
boys
could
not
answer
satisfactorily
touching
the
length
shape
and
strength
of
the
federal
lines
at
baton
rouge
and
then
joined
his
men
who
moved
down
the
road
toward
mooreville
did
you
forget
captain
roach
and
his
conscripts
asked
dick
when
they
were
out
of
sight
i
left
them
out
on
purpose
said
rodney
but
of
course
i
shall
speak
to
roach
about
it
when
we
take
that
note
to
tom
randolph
his
conscripts
are
all
my
near
neighbors
and
mostly
union
men
who
would
be
of
the
least
use
in
a
fight
and
dick
here
rodney
sunk
his
voice
to
a
whisper
if
i
can
do
it
without
risk
to
myself
i
shall
go
out
of
my
way
to
warn
them
of
what
coming
oh
you
traitor
cried
dick
you
would
do
the
same
if
you
were
in
my
fix
of
course
there
are
some
i
would
not
dare
speak
to
for
they
would
tell
where
they
got
the
information
but
those
i
can
trust
to
keep
a
still
tongue
in
their
heads
will
be
warned
if
i
can
find
them
the
boys
went
back
to
their
unfinished
breakfast
and
ate
heartily
as
they
had
often
done
while
men
all
around
them
were
forming
in
line
of
battle
and
shells
were
bursting
over
their
heads
but
still
rodney
was
anxious
for
the
coming
contest
might
bring
great
loss
to
his
father
there
were
many
bales
of
cotton
concealed
within
a
circle
of
a
few
miles
of
the
place
where
he
was
sitting
both
sides
had
proclaimed
it
contraband
of
war
and
it
seemed
impossible
that
a
line
of
battle
could
go
far
in
any
direction
without
discovering
some
of
it
and
the
destruction
of
part
would
lead
to
the
destruction
of
the
whole
for
some
of
those
who
lost
randolph
for
instance
would
be
mean
enough
to
point
out
the
of
the
rest
this
reflection
troubled
rodney
but
before
he
sat
down
to
another
meal
he
had
something
besides
cotton
to
think
about
the
scouts
of
the
opposing
armies
came
together
down
the
road
out
of
sight
but
within
plain
hearing
of
the
two
boys
who
ran
to
the
bars
and
listened
to
the
sounds
of
the
conflict
they
heard
the
sharp
quick
reports
of
the
carbines
and
the
cheers
and
yells
of
the
combatants
and
when
the
yells
became
fainter
and
at
last
died
away
altogether
and
the
cheers
grew
in
volume
until
they
became
one
continuous
cheer
they
looked
at
each
other
with
the
same
startling
question
in
their
eyes
that
the
first
encounter
and
we
whipped
said
dick
now
if
the
victorious
yanks
come
back
this
what
our
discharges
and
passes
and
permits
will
be
of
no
more
use
than
so
much
blank
paper
answered
rodney
they
say
that
if
we
given
information
of
some
sort
to
the
enemy
already
we
will
do
it
the
first
chance
we
get
and
so
we
better
trot
right
along
with
them
to
baton
rouge
that
what
i
am
afraid
of
i
do
want
to
go
to
baton
rouge
neither
do
i
and
so
i
am
going
to
do
as
other
and
better
men
have
done
under
similar
circumstances
afoot
or
on
horseback
inquired
dick
who
knew
that
his
friend
had
resolved
to
take
to
the
woods
on
horseback
to
save
our
animals
from
being
stolen
and
to
give
color
to
the
story
that
we
have
gone
to
town
replied
rodney
come
on
for
there
no
telling
how
soon
the
yanks
may
come
down
the
road
at
a
gallop
while
one
started
for
the
stable
yard
the
other
ran
in
to
tell
his
black
housekeeper
that
he
was
going
to
ride
toward
mooreville
where
he
would
remain
until
the
federals
had
left
the
country
yes
there
had
been
a
sharp
skirmish
down
there
in
the
woods
he
said
in
reply
to
the
woman
anxious
inquiries
the
confederates
had
been
driven
from
the
field
and
he
and
dick
thought
it
best
to
get
out
of
sight
for
awhile
the
federals
may
not
come
back
this
way
added
rodney
but
if
they
do
tell
the
truth
and
do
try
to
pass
me
off
for
a
union
man
they
know
as
well
as
you
do
that
i
have
served
my
time
in
the
confederate
army
and
there
nothing
to
gain
by
telling
a
different
story
if
anyone
asks
for
me
you
can
say
that
i
have
ridden
toward
mooreville
well
he
and
dick
did
ride
toward
mooreville
but
they
did
not
go
there
not
knowing
how
far
the
darkeys
could
be
trusted
they
went
down
the
road
half
a
mile
or
so
and
turning
into
the
woods
hitched
their
horses
close
together
so
that
they
would
not
call
to
each
other
and
finally
took
up
a
position
from
which
they
could
see
the
house
and
anybody
who
approached
it
these
precautions
were
not
taken
any
too
soon
for
the
federals
did
scout
back
that
way
and
when
they
came
in
sight
they
were
riding
at
top
speed
they
knew
that
a
large
party
of
horsemen
had
passed
along
the
road
before
them
for
they
saw
the
prints
of
many
hoofs
in
the
dust
some
of
them
kept
on
without
drawing
rein
while
others
went
into
the
house
and
all
over
it
but
as
no
contraband
goods
rewarded
their
search
they
left
it
standing
when
they
went
away
and
although
the
hands
all
left
their
work
in
the
field
and
ran
to
the
dwelling
when
they
saw
the
surrounding
it
they
did
not
improve
the
opportunity
to
secure
their
freedom
as
the
boys
thought
they
would
they
returned
to
their
work
when
the
soldiers
departed
and
rodney
and
dick
thought
it
safe
to
go
back
to
the
house
their
next
visitor
was
a
single
confederate
soldier
who
arrived
just
at
dusk
with
a
note
addressed
to
captain
thomas
randolph
commdg
mooreville
troops
this
man
rodney
took
into
the
house
and
fed
as
if
he
had
been
a
brother
for
he
was
anxious
to
learn
something
about
the
battle
that
was
soon
to
take
place
but
although
the
messenger
said
he
was
orderly
at
headquarters
he
could
or
would
give
very
little
information
breckenridge
was
rapidly
feeling
his
way
toward
the
city
he
said
he
would
soon
be
reinforced
by
the
command
of
general
ruggles
which
would
be
picked
up
at
camp
pinckney
and
with
the
to
help
and
clean
the
yankee
gunboats
out
of
the
river
there
was
no
doubt
but
that
a
decisive
victory
awaited
him
and
having
finished
his
supper
and
said
all
he
had
to
say
the
messenger
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
off
five
minutes
later
rodney
and
dick
had
mounted
theirs
and
were
riding
hard
to
carry
that
note
to
captain
randolph
they
stopped
at
rodney
home
just
long
enough
to
put
the
folks
on
nettles
with
the
very
meager
information
they
had
to
give
and
a
quarter
of
an
hour
afterward
were
sitting
in
randolph
parlor
waiting
for
tom
to
show
himself
when
he
came
he
was
accompanied
by
his
mother
hallo
boys
exclaimed
tom
with
great
apparent
cordiality
while
randolph
shook
hands
with
them
one
after
the
other
you
know
how
i
have
longed
to
see
you
both
in
order
that
all
right
interposed
rodney
who
knew
there
was
a
word
of
truth
in
what
tom
had
set
out
to
say
but
if
you
will
excuse
is
an
order
that
i
was
requested
to
place
in
your
hands
who
got
any
right
to
order
me
around
exclaimed
tom
taking
the
note
and
fixing
his
gaze
upon
the
writing
on
the
outside
thomas
randolph
he
read
aloud
somebody
has
made
a
big
mistake
for
i
do
belong
to
the
army
of
the
confederate
states
and
never
did
what
in
it
i
do
know
answered
rodney
while
randolph
suggested
that
it
might
be
a
good
plan
for
him
to
open
it
and
find
out
tom
did
so
with
evident
reluctance
and
before
he
had
fairly
had
time
to
make
himself
master
of
its
contents
he
turned
as
white
as
a
sheet
and
fell
heavily
into
the
nearest
chair
oh
my
dear
boy
what
is
the
matter
what
could
have
disturbed
you
so
cried
his
mother
who
was
really
alarmed
i
not
obey
it
shouted
captain
tom
as
soon
as
he
could
speak
who
is
this
colonel
clark
who
takes
it
upon
himself
to
command
me
to
hold
my
company
ready
to
move
at
a
moment
notice
and
what
does
he
want
of
the
company
anyhow
no
doubt
he
wants
you
to
began
rodney
but
how
does
he
know
that
there
is
such
a
fellow
as
i
am
in
the
world
and
that
i
command
a
company
of
state
troops
continued
tom
who
was
almost
beside
himself
with
terror
acting
on
his
own
responsibility
and
serving
under
the
eye
of
a
confederate
officer
were
two
widely
different
things
his
mother
took
the
note
from
his
hand
and
read
it
and
she
too
became
visibly
affected
what
can
be
the
meaning
of
it
she
asked
of
rodney
it
means
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
battle
somewhere
in
this
vicinity
and
that
tom
must
bring
his
men
out
to
help
was
the
reply
rodney
had
predicted
just
such
a
scene
as
this
and
was
prepared
to
enjoy
it
a
battle
gasped
randolph
somewhere
in
this
vicinity
echoed
tom
that
what
they
tell
me
and
indeed
there
has
been
a
skirmish
already
breckenridge
is
coming
here
to
drive
the
yankees
out
of
baton
rouge
and
the
is
coming
to
assist
him
tom
and
his
mother
were
too
amazed
to
speak
they
stared
stupidly
at
the
bearer
of
these
evil
tidings
and
listened
in
a
dazed
sort
of
way
while
he
told
what
he
had
heard
and
seen
since
morning
there
was
one
thing
tom
and
his
mother
could
not
understand
and
that
was
how
colonel
clark
whoever
he
might
be
knew
there
was
a
company
of
home
guards
at
mooreville
and
that
tom
was
commander
of
them
but
of
course
rodney
did
not
enlighten
them
on
that
point
you
enlisted
for
just
such
work
as
this
said
he
no
i
did
shouted
tom
and
what
more
i
wo
go
i
as
close
to
the
yankees
as
i
want
to
be
and
besides
i
do
belong
to
the
service
any
longer
i
resigned
this
was
news
to
the
boys
who
could
scarcely
refrain
from
showing
how
surprised
they
were
to
hear
it
they
were
disappointed
as
well
for
if
tom
told
the
truth
they
would
lose
the
fun
of
hearing
how
he
took
to
the
bushes
to
escape
duty
of
course
if
your
resignation
has
been
accepted
by
the
governor
said
rodney
why
it
has
been
accepted
yet
replied
tom
speaking
before
he
thought
i
only
sent
it
then
you
are
still
in
the
service
and
can
be
held
to
duty
said
dick
and
captain
tom
and
his
mother
both
heard
the
sigh
of
satisfaction
that
escaped
him
as
he
uttered
the
words
i
have
known
men
to
go
into
action
and
be
killed
after
their
term
of
service
expired
but
i
wo
do
it
i
bet
you
whined
tom
with
tears
in
his
eyes
do
you
think
it
will
be
a
very
hard
fight
it
ca
help
it
it
bound
to
be
and
you
see
more
dead
and
wounded
men
lying
around
than
gracious
i
glad
they
call
on
you
and
me
dick
why
wo
you
have
to
go
faltered
randolph
no
we
showed
our
discharges
and
they
never
said
a
word
about
ordering
us
out
they
ca
for
we
have
served
our
time
this
was
the
heaviest
blow
yet
and
captain
tom
came
so
near
wilting
under
it
that
rodney
heart
smote
him
and
he
determined
to
take
his
leave
so
he
got
upon
his
feet
and
dick
followed
his
example
what
will
they
do
to
tom
if
he
fails
to
obey
this
order
asked
randolph
who
in
all
the
trying
ordeals
through
which
she
had
passed
on
her
cowardly
son
account
had
never
before
been
so
badly
frightened
i
could
obey
it
if
i
wanted
to
cried
tom
my
men
are
scattered
for
miles
through
the
country
and
i
could
spend
the
night
in
hunting
them
up
they
may
call
it
disobedience
of
orders
if
you
do
do
it
replied
rodney
who
wanted
to
laugh
if
i
were
in
your
place
i
would
make
the
effort
and
run
the
risk
of
being
shot
but
suppose
my
men
refuse
to
turn
out
said
tom
a
bright
idea
coming
into
his
mind
then
you
will
be
blameless
and
all
you
have
to
do
will
be
to
report
to
the
colonel
and
tell
him
that
you
are
ready
for
any
duty
he
may
assign
you
and
ca
i
stay
at
home
any
way
i
can
fix
it
inquired
tom
who
made
no
effort
to
conceal
his
terror
i
would
what
if
some
of
the
colonel
troopers
should
find
you
skulking
here
when
you
ought
to
be
in
the
front
rank
or
suppose
the
battle
should
be
fought
on
your
plantation
would
baton
rouge
is
not
on
our
plantation
i
know
but
a
battle
sometimes
ends
a
good
many
miles
from
where
it
begins
and
the
one
that
coming
is
as
likely
to
be
fought
here
as
anywhere
else
and
if
that
should
happen
would
you
rather
have
a
musket
in
your
hands
than
go
skulking
through
the
bushes
trying
to
keep
out
of
danger
i
would
a
hundred
times
over
but
really
we
must
be
going
rodney
and
his
companion
bowed
themselves
to
the
door
and
went
out
and
captain
tom
and
his
mother
sat
in
their
chairs
looking
at
each
other
and
listening
to
the
clatter
of
the
receding
hoofs
when
it
died
away
altogether
tom
jumped
to
his
feet
in
great
excitement
we
never
once
thought
to
ask
them
where
they
got
that
order
or
why
it
was
sent
by
their
hands
instead
of
by
the
hands
of
one
of
that
colonel
own
men
he
fairly
sputtered
mother
it
an
infamous
trick
and
there
is
going
to
be
any
fight
i
remember
rodney
gray
for
this
and
other
things
he
has
done
to
see
if
i
do
i
hope
you
are
duly
ashamed
of
yourself
for
frightening
that
poor
woman
so
terribly
said
dick
as
he
and
rodney
galloped
out
of
the
yard
and
turned
their
horses
toward
the
village
why
did
she
stay
out
of
the
room
retorted
rodney
we
sent
in
word
that
we
desired
to
see
captain
tom
privately
but
she
did
take
the
hint
so
tom
thought
he
could
spend
the
night
in
riding
about
the
country
well
we
got
to
if
we
do
the
work
we
set
out
to
do
the
first
part
of
that
work
was
to
call
upon
captain
roach
who
had
excited
tom
randolph
ire
by
accepting
rodney
invitation
to
dinner
and
the
next
to
warn
some
of
the
union
men
whom
he
had
conscripted
the
former
was
overwhelmed
with
surprise
and
did
know
what
to
do
not
being
a
veteran
but
he
was
a
coward
if
he
did
turn
white
he
talked
the
matter
over
very
calmly
with
his
visitors
and
following
their
advice
said
he
would
drop
the
conscript
business
until
the
battle
had
been
decided
one
way
or
the
other
and
then
he
looked
helplessly
at
rodney
as
if
to
ask
what
he
should
do
next
you
ought
to
do
duty
or
shed
that
uniform
said
the
boy
bluntly
you
ca
assemble
your
conscripts
now
and
if
you
could
where
would
you
find
men
to
guard
them
to
camp
pinckney
you
can
only
show
your
by
reporting
at
the
camp
and
if
i
were
in
your
place
i
think
i
should
start
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
if
you
delay
you
will
be
liable
to
be
cut
off
by
federal
scouting
parties
have
you
seen
any
yanks
about
here
captain
roach
replied
that
he
had
seen
or
heard
of
any
and
rodney
went
on
to
tell
about
the
skirmish
that
had
taken
place
near
his
plantation
and
how
he
and
dick
had
taken
to
the
woods
and
escaped
being
caught
in
the
house
the
federals
could
prove
anything
against
them
he
said
but
they
could
shut
them
up
in
baton
rouge
until
breckenridge
captured
it
or
was
driven
back
where
he
came
from
and
that
was
something
he
did
want
them
to
do
then
he
and
dick
shook
hands
with
the
enrolling
officer
wished
him
good
luck
and
went
out
into
the
night
to
finish
their
work
it
kept
them
busy
until
daylight
and
then
they
went
to
gray
to
breakfast
happy
in
the
knowledge
that
they
had
done
as
they
would
be
done
by
and
not
one
who
wished
them
harm
was
the
wiser
for
it
tom
randolph
was
hardly
out
of
bed
the
next
morning
before
he
was
made
aware
that
there
was
some
truth
in
rodney
gray
story
a
squad
of
federal
cavalry
went
by
the
house
on
a
keen
jump
and
about
an
hour
behind
them
a
larger
squad
of
confederates
went
past
at
the
same
rapid
gait
tom
was
soldier
enough
to
know
that
these
were
nothing
but
scouts
and
in
his
ignorance
supposed
that
the
battle
had
been
fought
while
he
was
asleep
and
that
the
confederates
had
driven
their
antagonists
but
it
was
not
long
before
he
discovered
that
the
worst
was
yet
to
come
all
that
day
soldiers
in
gray
uniforms
were
in
sight
somewhere
they
streamed
by
the
house
or
came
into
the
yard
and
gathered
about
the
well
and
an
officer
with
high
and
a
fierce
mustache
stood
on
the
front
gallery
and
issued
orders
in
a
voice
that
sounded
as
loud
as
a
they
trampled
down
the
flower
beds
cleared
the
cellar
of
everything
eatable
and
helped
themselves
to
what
there
was
in
the
kitchen
and
through
it
all
the
captain
of
the
home
guards
never
showed
himself
some
of
the
time
he
was
in
the
garret
oftener
he
was
under
the
bed
in
his
mother
room
and
then
again
his
frightened
eyes
were
peeping
through
the
carefully
closed
blinds
he
had
never
dreamed
that
there
were
so
many
men
in
an
army
and
yet
he
saw
but
one
column
of
a
very
small
army
for
breckenridge
made
his
assault
with
less
than
men
to
his
immense
relief
no
one
asked
for
him
and
perhaps
the
reason
was
because
colonel
clark
who
wrote
that
order
was
with
the
other
column
five
or
six
miles
away
the
attack
on
baton
rouge
was
made
the
next
morning
at
daylight
and
although
rodney
and
dick
heard
little
of
it
and
saw
less
they
had
some
hospital
work
on
their
hands
the
heat
was
intense
and
everywhere
along
the
line
of
march
men
fell
exhausted
out
of
the
ranks
and
were
taken
in
and
cared
for
by
the
planters
rodney
house
and
were
filled
with
soldiers
who
could
not
go
any
farther
toward
the
enemy
although
they
recovered
their
strength
and
power
of
action
very
suddenly
when
it
became
known
that
there
was
a
possibility
of
the
enemy
cavalry
coming
toward
them
the
attack
which
was
so
successful
at
first
that
the
federal
camps
were
captured
or
burned
failed
utterly
in
the
end
and
at
noon
the
fight
was
over
and
the
confederates
were
in
full
retreat
the
did
not
come
down
to
help
with
her
big
guns
and
if
she
had
she
might
have
met
a
warmer
reception
than
she
bargained
for
for
there
were
five
gunboats
in
the
river
including
the
these
took
an
earnest
part
in
the
fight
while
waiting
for
the
their
fire
being
directed
by
an
army
signal
officer
who
stood
on
the
roof
of
the
capitol
building
the
confederates
were
so
badly
whipped
that
they
left
seventy
men
on
the
field
for
the
union
forces
to
bury
the
closing
scene
of
the
fight
was
enacted
the
next
morning
the
went
up
the
river
six
miles
found
the
terrible
with
her
ten
heavy
guns
and
picked
men
hard
and
fast
aground
and
pounded
her
so
severely
that
in
fifteen
minutes
she
was
set
on
fire
and
abandoned
she
blew
up
when
the
fire
reached
her
magazine
but
she
left
others
behind
which
made
themselves
known
and
feared
before
the
war
was
over
chapter
xvii
conclusion
this
short
visit
of
the
confederate
army
was
like
a
plague
of
locusts
everything
in
the
shape
of
eatables
in
and
around
mooreville
that
they
could
place
their
hands
on
disappeared
and
was
never
heard
of
afterward
some
articles
of
value
disappeared
likewise
as
was
to
have
been
expected
but
not
very
many
for
the
settlers
had
learned
that
it
was
best
to
be
careful
of
such
things
during
war
times
no
one
had
seen
a
home
guard
during
those
two
troublous
days
nobody
could
tell
where
captain
randolph
had
kept
himself
or
how
he
had
behaved
and
neither
was
there
any
news
to
be
had
of
captain
roach
our
two
friends
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
when
the
fuss
was
over
congratulated
themselves
on
having
escaped
both
duty
and
suspicion
and
waited
with
what
patience
they
could
for
the
excitement
to
pass
away
so
that
it
would
be
safe
for
them
to
go
into
the
city
but
that
time
seemed
long
in
coming
inquisitive
federal
scouts
who
asked
troublesome
questions
and
insisted
on
knowing
all
about
everything
came
to
the
house
every
day
and
on
three
occasions
wounded
confederate
stragglers
appealed
to
their
pity
and
begged
assistance
nor
were
these
appeals
made
in
vain
though
the
boys
took
great
risks
in
concealing
their
confederate
friends
during
the
day
and
helping
them
on
their
road
at
night
they
deceived
their
neighbors
hoodwinked
the
darkeys
they
were
afraid
to
trust
and
told
gauzy
stories
to
federal
scouts
until
dick
affirmed
that
deceiving
and
lying
would
become
a
confirmed
habit
with
them
but
fortunately
the
necessity
for
these
things
passed
away
before
that
happened
the
country
was
cleared
of
stragglers
after
a
while
the
settlement
quieted
down
and
rodney
and
dick
were
ready
for
the
next
thing
on
the
programme
i
do
know
when
i
have
had
so
hard
a
task
set
before
me
said
rodney
and
i
would
be
glad
to
put
it
off
forever
if
i
could
but
since
the
parting
must
come
it
might
as
well
be
one
time
as
another
shall
we
start
for
the
city
morning
dick
answered
with
a
decided
affirmative
and
the
start
was
made
believing
that
he
ought
to
be
ready
to
act
as
soon
as
the
opportunity
was
presented
he
took
leave
of
rodney
father
and
mother
as
though
he
never
expected
to
see
them
again
and
rodney
drew
on
the
family
purse
for
a
good
many
gold
pieces
if
dick
succeeded
in
getting
across
the
river
he
would
still
have
a
long
journey
before
than
the
one
rodney
made
from
cedar
bluff
landing
to
price
he
would
need
a
horse
to
ride
a
coat
and
blanket
to
cover
him
when
he
camped
at
night
and
money
to
purchase
his
supplies
and
his
friend
forethought
provided
for
all
these
necessary
things
on
their
way
to
baton
rouge
they
passed
over
the
ground
on
which
the
right
wing
of
the
confederate
force
formed
in
line
of
battle
previous
to
the
assault
it
was
just
beyond
turnbull
house
and
that
gentleman
wife
after
giving
a
glowing
description
of
the
gallant
way
in
which
the
confederates
advanced
to
the
attack
told
the
boys
in
a
confidential
whisper
that
she
had
aided
two
yankees
who
were
captured
and
managed
to
escape
during
the
fight
that
there
was
a
wounded
rebel
in
one
of
the
upper
rooms
of
her
house
at
that
moment
that
he
was
going
to
remain
there
until
he
was
able
to
travel
and
that
one
of
the
escaped
prisoners
whom
rodney
befriended
had
smuggled
medicine
through
the
lines
for
him
at
her
request
thus
proving
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
gratitude
in
the
world
before
the
boys
left
the
house
they
visited
the
wounded
rebel
in
his
room
and
he
told
them
that
the
fight
was
the
most
savagely
contested
of
any
he
had
ever
been
in
and
for
the
number
of
men
engaged
the
bloodiest
some
of
the
indiana
and
michigan
boys
fought
with
rails
which
they
snatched
from
the
fences
and
the
yank
who
smuggled
the
medicine
out
for
him
said
he
had
counted
thirteen
dead
rebs
in
one
heap
it
was
bad
for
our
side
moaned
the
wounded
soldier
and
even
if
the
had
been
there
to
help
us
i
do
suppose
we
would
have
made
any
better
showing
the
yanks
had
things
fixed
for
us
and
now
i
got
to
hobble
through
the
world
on
one
leg
although
some
stray
missiles
from
the
confederate
side
found
their
way
into
the
streets
of
the
city
the
boys
did
not
find
there
as
many
signs
of
the
conflict
as
they
expected
to
see
martin
buildings
escaped
unscathed
but
martin
himself
had
been
placed
in
arrest
to
prevent
him
from
holding
any
communication
with
the
enemy
as
if
i
ever
dreamed
of
doing
such
a
foolish
thing
said
he
contemptuously
why
i
want
to
live
here
and
consequently
i
do
nothing
that
i
consider
to
be
risky
but
i
have
seen
the
mail
carrier
and
he
is
going
to
pick
up
some
bags
this
very
night
pick
them
up
repeated
rodney
where
are
they
out
in
the
country
somewhere
and
he
is
out
there
too
or
will
be
at
eight
and
if
your
friend
wants
to
go
now
his
chance
martin
i
hope
your
kind
efforts
in
my
behalf
will
not
bring
you
into
trouble
with
the
yanks
said
dick
i
feel
very
grateful
to
you
but
he
did
look
so
and
neither
did
rodney
the
time
when
they
must
part
was
close
at
hand
i
do
want
to
hurry
you
away
continued
martin
but
as
it
will
take
some
little
time
to
ride
to
the
place
to
which
i
shall
direct
you
you
had
better
have
your
horses
out
of
the
stable
at
five
so
as
to
pass
the
pickets
before
dark
i
will
give
you
a
letter
that
will
make
you
all
right
with
henderson
the
rest
of
the
day
to
quote
from
dick
graham
flew
away
as
if
the
hours
had
been
greased
four
came
before
they
knew
it
and
with
it
the
letter
their
host
had
promised
them
accompanied
by
some
instructions
which
they
must
closely
follow
in
order
to
find
and
obtain
an
interview
with
henderson
he
was
a
cross
crabbed
old
fellow
martin
said
but
the
boys
must
mind
that
they
would
be
cross
and
suspicious
too
if
they
had
been
bothered
and
balked
in
their
business
as
henderson
had
been
followed
and
harassed
in
his
they
must
try
and
get
on
the
right
side
of
him
for
he
could
take
dick
to
the
other
side
if
anybody
could
martin
excused
himself
for
not
accompanying
them
to
the
stable
where
they
left
their
horses
by
saying
that
to
be
seen
walking
the
streets
with
a
suspected
man
would
bring
suspicion
upon
them
and
that
was
one
thing
they
wanted
to
avoid
the
boys
left
the
city
and
the
pickets
behind
in
good
season
and
took
pains
to
make
some
noise
as
they
galloped
past
the
houses
of
three
converted
rebels
who
so
martin
said
were
always
watching
and
scheming
for
a
chance
to
report
somebody
they
rode
as
if
they
were
going
home
but
when
darkness
came
they
doubled
upon
their
trail
passed
these
same
houses
again
in
silence
and
turned
into
a
lane
that
took
them
miles
up
the
river
to
the
of
henderson
the
mail
carrier
they
found
it
to
be
a
pretentious
plantation
house
situated
in
plain
view
of
the
river
and
not
at
all
such
a
spot
as
they
would
have
chosen
had
they
been
engaged
in
henderson
business
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
surprise
the
mail
carrier
in
his
however
as
they
found
when
they
approached
nearer
to
it
for
they
had
barely
time
to
shout
out
the
customary
hallo
the
house
let
your
dogs
bite
before
their
horses
were
surrounded
by
a
pack
of
belligerent
canines
whose
angry
yelping
completely
drowned
the
voice
of
the
master
of
the
house
get
out
he
shouted
as
soon
as
he
could
make
himself
heard
above
the
tumult
who
is
it
and
what
wanted
friends
from
the
city
replied
rodney
who
had
been
told
just
what
to
say
i
have
a
communication
for
henderson
from
our
mutual
friend
martin
will
you
look
at
it
the
planter
came
down
to
the
gate
took
the
letter
from
rodney
hand
looking
sharply
at
him
and
dick
as
he
did
so
and
carried
it
into
the
house
with
him
he
did
not
ask
them
to
alight
and
hitch
and
that
proved
that
there
was
something
or
somebody
in
the
house
he
did
not
want
the
boys
to
see
it
was
all
of
ten
minutes
before
he
came
out
again
and
he
brought
with
him
a
companion
who
straightway
made
himself
known
by
saying
in
a
complaining
voice
i
told
martin
i
could
do
the
like
and
here
he
gone
and
sent
you
just
as
if
i
had
agreed
to
do
it
which
one
of
you
is
the
fool
i
am
the
one
who
wants
to
go
over
the
river
if
you
will
be
kind
enough
to
let
me
have
a
seat
in
your
boat
replied
dick
who
said
anything
about
a
boat
demanded
henderson
for
the
boys
were
sure
it
was
he
do
you
want
to
be
captured
by
the
gunboats
and
sent
up
for
a
spy
or
something
i
do
expect
to
get
back
alive
or
get
across
either
but
then
martin
a
friend
of
mine
and
keeps
me
posted
in
some
things
get
off
both
of
you
hitch
your
horses
somewhere
and
wait
till
i
come
dick
you
as
good
as
off
at
last
whispered
rodney
as
the
two
men
turned
about
and
went
back
to
the
house
think
of
me
riding
all
the
way
to
turnbull
alone
in
the
dark
while
you
are
running
the
risk
of
being
overhauled
by
the
naval
picket
boats
have
you
got
your
money
and
discharge
all
right
write
to
me
if
you
see
the
ghost
of
a
chance
for
a
letter
to
get
through
for
i
shall
be
anxious
to
hear
from
my
old
barrington
chum
the
boys
had
plenty
to
say
to
each
other
and
an
abundance
of
time
to
say
it
in
for
a
whole
hour
passed
before
the
mail
carrier
again
came
out
this
time
he
had
two
men
with
planter
and
another
passenger
the
latter
being
muffled
up
to
the
eyes
so
that
no
one
could
have
seen
his
face
if
it
had
been
broad
daylight
he
said
not
a
word
but
the
mail
carrier
did
and
rodney
was
gratified
to
notice
that
he
was
as
careful
to
conceal
dick
identity
as
he
was
that
of
his
other
passenger
come
on
you
moses
said
he
and
remember
that
you
are
deaf
dumb
and
blind
you
jonas
get
on
your
horse
and
clear
yourself
it
would
have
done
no
good
to
prolong
the
and
rodney
was
glad
to
have
it
broken
off
so
abruptly
he
gave
his
friend
hand
a
final
squeeze
and
shake
and
when
he
came
into
the
road
again
a
moment
later
riding
one
horse
and
leading
the
other
there
was
no
one
in
sight
the
way
home
was
a
long
and
lonely
one
to
rodney
gray
who
felt
as
if
the
last
tie
that
bound
him
to
his
school
days
had
been
sundered
forever
he
got
through
without
any
trouble
although
he
met
some
inquisitive
people
who
wanted
to
know
how
he
happened
to
have
a
riderless
horse
with
him
passed
one
night
at
his
father
house
and
in
due
time
was
back
in
his
old
quarters
on
the
upper
plantation
where
he
had
spent
so
many
pleasant
hours
with
the
absent
dick
but
before
he
had
leisure
to
look
about
and
tell
himself
how
very
lonesome
he
was
he
had
visitors
one
of
whom
threw
him
into
a
terrible
state
of
mind
before
he
left
they
were
a
squad
of
the
michigan
boys
and
commanded
by
the
corporal
who
had
once
taken
him
prisoner
and
whose
name
he
had
never
heard
they
demanded
all
the
weapons
he
had
and
threatened
to
go
through
his
house
if
he
did
trot
them
right
out
but
when
they
went
to
the
well
for
water
the
corporal
drew
off
on
one
side
intimating
by
a
look
that
he
had
something
to
say
to
rodney
in
private
where
your
partner
were
the
first
words
he
said
when
they
were
alone
gone
over
the
river
answered
rodney
how
long
since
he
went
night
before
last
well
i
bet
you
a
he
did
make
it
some
of
your
good
friends
were
the
means
of
stopping
him
you
see
he
went
on
without
giving
the
astonished
rodney
time
to
speak
ben
and
another
boy
who
were
in
my
party
when
you
and
griffin
did
so
much
for
us
scouted
down
randolph
way
a
few
days
after
the
fight
and
that
home
you
made
a
big
blunder
when
you
stuck
to
us
till
we
let
him
go
now
gone
back
on
you
what
has
he
done
inquired
rodney
who
told
himself
that
that
was
just
what
he
expected
from
tom
randolph
why
ben
distinctly
heard
him
tell
one
of
our
officers
that
a
bearer
of
despatches
would
go
from
mooreville
in
a
few
days
intending
to
cross
the
river
at
baton
rouge
where
he
had
friends
to
help
him
said
the
corporal
of
course
the
matter
was
reported
at
headquarters
and
the
houses
of
all
the
secession
sympathizers
in
the
city
were
watched
closer
than
ever
was
martin
house
watched
do
you
know
why
certainly
he
is
always
watched
and
we
had
him
under
arrest
during
the
fight
and
i
was
simple
enough
to
tell
the
provost
marshal
that
that
house
would
be
my
as
often
as
i
came
to
the
city
groaned
rodney
you
need
blame
yourself
for
that
for
i
do
suppose
it
made
a
particle
of
difference
said
the
corporal
soothingly
the
provost
marshal
would
have
found
it
out
sooner
or
later
because
it
is
a
part
of
his
business
to
find
out
where
every
stranger
lives
and
what
he
does
while
inside
the
lines
if
you
went
there
with
your
friend
i
did
whispered
rodney
and
we
went
from
there
up
henderson
well
he
watched
too
and
if
one
is
caught
the
other
will
be
if
tom
randolph
has
got
dick
graham
into
trouble
i
will
see
that
he
is
well
punished
for
it
said
rodney
angrily
if
he
has
it
is
because
he
did
try
if
you
say
the
word
i
will
go
straight
to
his
house
and
arrest
him
for
a
home
guard
no
no
do
do
that
i
am
not
coward
enough
to
take
revenge
on
him
in
that
way
but
since
he
has
made
his
boast
that
he
is
willing
to
die
for
the
south
i
will
see
that
he
has
all
the
chance
he
wants
well
my
boys
seem
to
have
had
their
fill
of
water
so
we
jog
along
said
the
corporal
if
the
home
guards
bother
you
let
us
know
and
we
clean
them
out
to
the
last
man
astonished
at
the
extent
of
the
corporal
information
and
wondering
how
it
was
possible
for
any
southern
sympathizer
to
live
in
baton
rouge
when
he
knew
that
he
was
so
closely
watched
rodney
went
into
the
house
as
soon
as
the
soldiers
rode
away
and
sat
down
to
write
a
letter
as
a
general
thing
his
thoughts
came
rapidly
and
it
was
no
trouble
for
him
to
put
them
on
paper
but
this
particular
letter
seemed
to
bother
him
for
he
made
three
copies
of
it
before
he
got
it
to
suit
him
then
he
ordered
his
horse
brought
to
the
door
changed
his
working
clothes
for
a
business
suit
and
galloped
off
in
the
direction
of
mooreville
he
stopped
at
his
home
just
long
enough
to
let
his
mother
see
that
he
was
all
right
and
then
rode
on
again
but
not
toward
mooreville
or
the
river
there
was
no
one
at
either
place
whom
he
wanted
to
see
that
day
but
he
did
want
to
have
a
few
earnest
words
with
general
ruggles
if
he
could
find
him
during
the
fight
the
general
commanded
the
confederate
column
that
came
from
camp
pinckney
and
there
was
where
rodney
hoped
to
find
him
now
before
he
had
ridden
a
dozen
miles
into
the
country
he
ran
into
a
small
party
of
rebels
who
looked
at
his
discharge
and
encouraged
him
by
saying
that
the
officer
he
desired
to
see
commanded
the
camp
and
was
recruiting
men
as
rapidly
as
he
could
for
some
special
service
that
was
to
be
performed
up
about
holly
springs
i
know
by
experience
that
special
service
usually
means
dangerous
service
thought
rodney
as
he
rode
on
his
way
if
tom
randolph
really
wants
to
do
something
for
the
south
he
will
jump
at
the
chance
of
going
to
holly
springs
camp
pinckney
looked
just
as
it
did
when
he
and
dick
graham
ran
the
guard
there
on
their
way
home
only
there
were
more
men
who
were
being
made
into
soldiers
and
the
number
was
being
increased
every
day
by
the
disconsolate
and
homesick
conscripts
who
were
sent
there
from
all
the
districts
in
that
part
of
the
state
rodney
was
shown
at
once
into
the
presence
of
the
commander
and
knew
before
he
had
exchanged
a
dozen
words
with
him
that
he
would
have
no
use
for
the
letter
he
had
taken
so
much
pains
to
write
i
can
attend
to
the
business
myself
without
any
aid
from
the
governor
said
general
ruggles
who
looked
more
like
a
farmer
than
he
did
like
a
brave
and
skilful
soldier
the
manner
in
which
recruiting
has
been
done
in
this
district
is
enough
to
make
one
forget
the
third
commandment
there
has
been
a
single
man
sent
to
this
camp
from
your
neighborhood
i
am
aware
of
it
sir
but
as
these
men
belong
to
the
state
and
not
to
the
confederacy
i
thought
there
no
need
of
it
sir
interrupted
the
general
i
have
all
the
authority
i
want
and
can
do
the
business
without
saying
a
word
to
the
governor
sent
in
his
resignation
has
he
he
continued
writing
the
name
on
a
slip
of
paper
and
it
has
not
yet
been
accepted
and
how
many
men
do
you
think
he
has
in
his
company
all
right
you
go
home
and
say
nothing
to
anybody
and
i
will
put
him
where
he
will
meet
something
besides
unarmed
men
and
women
and
children
his
business
having
been
transacted
to
his
entire
satisfaction
rodney
was
in
no
particular
haste
to
go
home
he
made
friends
with
one
of
the
veterans
who
composed
the
camp
guard
ate
supper
with
him
and
slept
under
half
his
blanket
that
night
but
the
morning
sun
saw
him
well
on
his
return
journey
he
made
a
wide
circuit
to
avoid
passing
through
mooreville
and
did
not
go
near
his
father
house
for
fear
it
might
be
remembered
against
him
at
some
future
time
he
went
home
as
rapidly
as
he
could
go
unsaddled
his
horse
and
turned
him
into
the
and
went
into
the
house
and
there
seated
in
rodney
favorite
rocking
chair
with
his
feet
upon
the
back
of
another
and
a
book
in
his
hand
graham
you
got
cheek
why
did
you
come
out
when
you
heard
me
at
the
bars
exclaimed
rodney
as
soon
as
he
found
his
tongue
because
i
thought
you
would
prefer
to
come
in
and
find
me
replied
dick
and
then
he
dropped
his
book
and
jumped
to
his
feet
and
the
two
embraced
each
other
schoolboy
fashion
o
dick
you
do
know
how
i
have
worried
about
you
said
rodney
and
tom
randolph
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
you
would
have
been
watched
if
he
had
said
a
word
but
what
i
mean
is
that
he
made
matters
worse
i
have
paid
him
for
it
however
now
tell
me
all
about
it
we
did
succeed
and
that
all
there
is
to
tell
answered
dick
we
made
six
attempts
on
two
different
nights
and
once
got
so
near
to
the
other
shore
that
i
was
sure
we
would
make
it
but
the
picket
boats
from
the
fleet
showed
up
and
we
had
to
dig
out
they
were
on
hand
every
time
and
you
ought
to
have
heard
henderson
cuss
he
declared
that
one
or
the
other
of
his
passengers
was
a
jonah
and
he
had
a
notion
to
chuck
us
both
overboard
so
as
to
be
sure
he
got
the
right
one
it
was
you
dick
who
was
the
other
passenger
i
do
know
any
more
about
him
now
than
i
did
when
i
first
saw
him
when
we
gave
up
trying
on
the
first
night
and
went
back
to
the
house
he
shut
himself
in
his
room
and
i
never
saw
him
till
we
went
out
on
the
second
night
to
try
it
over
again
no
doubt
he
was
a
officer
with
important
papers
in
his
pockets
of
course
the
picket
boats
opened
fire
on
you
of
course
they
did
for
we
saw
or
heard
them
in
time
to
dodge
out
of
their
way
one
of
them
passed
so
close
to
us
that
we
could
see
dark
as
it
was
that
she
pulled
six
oars
on
a
side
if
she
seen
us
or
heard
us
breathe
she
would
have
had
us
sure
go
on
what
did
you
do
on
the
night
i
left
you
nothing
we
walked
about
a
mile
to
where
a
little
bay
made
into
the
bank
from
the
river
and
there
we
found
a
skiff
with
piles
of
something
in
the
bow
and
stern
that
i
took
to
be
the
precious
which
martin
said
henderson
was
going
to
pick
up
when
we
got
in
there
was
barely
room
for
henderson
to
work
the
oars
and
i
did
wonder
that
he
growled
so
about
taking
me
over
how
did
you
come
home
well
when
we
came
back
after
making
the
sixth
attempt
and
henderson
got
mad
and
told
me
to
clear
out
and
never
let
him
put
eyes
on
me
again
i
noticed
that
he
did
say
a
word
to
the
other
fellow
and
what
makes
me
think
that
he
was
an
officer
whom
henderson
had
to
take
whether
he
wanted
to
or
not
i
took
him
at
his
word
and
put
for
turnbull
that
gentleman
was
kind
enough
to
hitch
up
a
team
and
take
me
to
your
father
and
your
father
brought
me
here
to
find
you
gone
you
been
gone
three
nights
and
i
want
to
know
what
you
mean
by
such
work
i
been
to
camp
pinckney
to
make
arrangements
for
tom
randolph
and
his
home
guards
to
go
into
the
army
replied
rodney
adding
that
he
had
written
to
the
governor
laying
the
blame
for
the
bombardment
of
baton
rouge
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
home
guards
and
giving
such
other
incidents
in
their
history
as
he
thought
would
attract
the
attention
of
the
authorities
and
induce
them
to
do
something
but
general
ruggles
had
promised
to
attend
to
the
matter
himself
of
course
captain
randolph
will
be
very
much
obliged
to
you
when
he
hears
of
it
observed
dick
he
has
nobody
to
thank
but
himself
and
since
i
have
heard
what
those
escaped
prisoners
had
to
say
about
home
guards
i
wish
every
one
of
them
could
be
forced
into
the
army
now
you
got
to
stay
with
me
until
the
war
is
ended
one
way
or
the
other
have
you
not
much
i
going
up
to
port
hudson
to
try
it
again
if
you
will
show
me
the
way
and
you
ought
to
have
heard
henderson
rip
and
snort
because
i
did
go
there
in
the
first
place
without
troubling
him
but
you
see
i
did
know
that
i
could
and
you
did
either
if
i
can
take
a
boat
from
port
hudson
up
red
river
to
alexandria
or
better
yet
up
black
river
to
monroe
i
shall
save
miles
of
horseback
travel
and
run
the
risk
of
being
captured
by
gunboats
every
step
of
the
way
added
rodney
but
i
suppose
i
have
to
go
and
he
did
the
very
next
morning
this
time
there
was
no
trouble
about
it
for
when
the
steamer
which
was
regularly
employed
in
bringing
army
supplies
from
the
red
river
country
moved
out
from
her
landing
at
port
hudson
bound
for
monroe
she
carried
dick
graham
with
her
the
night
was
as
dark
as
a
pocket
but
the
lonely
rodney
kept
watch
on
the
bank
as
long
as
a
single
spark
could
be
seen
coming
out
of
her
smokestacks
and
even
lingered
about
the
place
for
two
or
three
days
almost
hoping
that
some
union
gunboat
would
send
a
shot
across
her
bows
and
drive
her
back
but
when
the
soldiers
assured
him
that
she
must
have
gone
through
safely
or
else
she
would
have
returned
within
a
few
hours
of
her
departure
he
realized
that
the
long
delayed
separation
had
come
at
last
and
turned
his
face
sorrowfully
homeward
he
went
directly
to
his
father
house
to
report
the
success
of
his
undertaking
and
learned
that
mooreville
had
been
thrown
into
a
state
of
great
excitement
during
his
absence
no
one
had
seen
or
heard
of
captain
roach
since
breckenridge
made
his
fruitless
attempt
to
take
the
city
but
his
office
was
occupied
by
a
grizzly
veteran
who
hardly
gave
himself
time
to
sit
down
in
captain
roach
chair
before
declaring
that
he
had
come
there
to
stand
nonsense
from
anybody
and
that
everyone
liable
to
military
duty
home
guards
and
all
must
make
tracks
for
camp
pinckney
or
be
dragged
there
by
the
neck
it
did
make
the
least
difference
to
him
how
they
went
but
they
must
go
they
might
be
sure
of
that
he
brought
fifty
veterans
with
him
to
back
him
up
and
in
less
than
hours
after
taking
possession
of
the
office
sent
off
conscripts
of
whom
were
home
guards
randolph
tried
the
same
game
with
major
morgan
that
the
new
man
name
that
she
tried
with
so
much
success
with
captain
roach
said
gray
with
a
laugh
but
it
did
work
the
major
sent
back
word
that
he
had
no
time
to
go
about
visiting
and
eating
dinners
and
tom
was
given
his
choice
between
reporting
at
the
camp
voluntarily
or
being
sent
there
under
guard
it
the
best
thing
that
was
ever
done
for
this
community
rodney
wanted
to
shout
but
instead
of
doing
that
he
got
on
his
horse
and
rode
down
to
call
on
major
morgan
he
did
find
the
office
filled
with
loafers
as
it
had
been
in
captain
roach
time
but
there
were
a
few
bronzed
fellows
standing
about
who
remembered
seeing
rodney
at
the
camp
and
bowed
to
him
as
he
came
in
the
major
remembered
him
too
and
said
as
he
gave
the
boy
hand
one
short
quick
jerk
that
was
doubtless
intended
for
a
shake
there
material
enough
here
to
form
the
finest
kind
of
a
battalion
why
do
you
apply
for
a
commission
and
go
out
with
it
you
had
rest
enough
by
this
time
because
i
do
wish
to
command
conscripts
replied
rodney
ignoring
the
fact
that
half
the
soldiers
in
the
confederate
armies
were
conscripts
and
nothing
else
being
held
to
service
against
their
will
besides
i
am
an
overseer
now
and
i
like
it
better
than
fighting
but
rodney
could
not
keep
out
of
trouble
as
easily
as
he
kept
out
of
the
army
nor
did
major
morgan
succeed
in
sending
all
tom
home
guards
to
camp
pinckney
some
of
them
lieutenants
lambert
and
moseley
among
the
rest
took
to
the
woods
and
became
freebooters
to
all
intents
and
purposes
whether
these
worthies
knew
or
suspected
that
he
had
a
hand
in
the
breaking
up
of
their
organization
rodney
never
learned
but
he
was
quickly
made
aware
that
they
did
not
intend
he
should
see
a
moment
peace
if
they
could
help
it
they
either
found
the
cotton
of
which
we
have
spoken
or
else
somebody
put
them
on
the
track
of
it
and
the
efforts
they
made
to
destroy
it
as
well
as
the
counter
efforts
made
by
rodney
gray
and
his
two
union
cousins
