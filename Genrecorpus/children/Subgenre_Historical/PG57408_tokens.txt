introduction
those
who
made
friends
with
lucy
gordon
on
governor
s
island
it
will
seem
a
great
change
to
find
her
in
this
second
story
so
far
away
from
home
she
is
only
one
of
thousands
though
to
whom
a
few
months
of
the
great
war
brought
more
changes
than
they
ever
thought
could
be
crowded
into
a
lifetime
lucy
can
look
back
over
less
than
a
year
to
her
old
life
at
the
army
post
in
new
york
harbor
before
the
colonel
was
ordered
overseas
to
that
brief
summer
time
when
the
gordon
family
was
united
during
her
brother
bob
s
west
point
graduation
leave
and
to
the
dark
days
of
the
winter
of
when
bob
was
in
a
german
prison
even
then
lucy
never
lost
hope
and
her
brave
confidence
was
gloriously
rewarded
with
bob
s
freedom
but
in
those
dreadful
weeks
of
waiting
she
outgrew
her
childhood
as
though
even
in
that
pleasant
home
on
governor
s
island
she
knew
that
peace
and
content
could
never
come
back
to
her
and
to
those
she
loved
until
america
had
fired
her
final
shot
at
germany
s
crumbling
lines
she
could
not
guess
what
lay
before
her
old
friends
she
was
to
meet
again
in
strange
new
places
yet
she
had
resolved
even
before
she
had
any
hope
of
crossing
to
the
other
side
that
come
what
might
she
would
serve
in
her
own
way
as
steadfastly
as
her
father
served
as
valiantly

really
nice
part
about
doing
hard
work
is
that
you
feel
so
happy
when
you
ve
left
off
remarked
janet
leslie
stretching
her
lazy
length
on
the
shady
grass
with
arms
beneath
her
head
lie
down
again
lucy
we
have
still
half
an
hour
to
i
m
not
tired
i
haven
t
worked
as
hard
as
you
and
edith
because
i
stopped
to
read
bob
s
letter
said
lucy
gordon
turning
toward
the
other
girl
of
the
trio
who
was
likewise
lying
on
the
grass
her
heavy
pigtail
fallen
across
one
sunburned
cheek
grunted
edith
morris
with
closed
eyelids
that
last
row
of
beans
was
almost
too
much
for

all
lucy
s
hazel
eyes
wandered
from
her
two
companions
across
the
wide
level
stretch
of
green
lit
by
the
noonday
sun
to
where
the
light
spring
shadows
of
the
oak
groves
checkered
its
edges
the
smooth
turf
was
all
cut
up
into
a
dozen
big
with
reckless
disregard
of
the
beautiful
velvet
lawn
busy
hands
had
plowed
and
planted
until
everywhere
were
springing
up
young
corn
and
beans
peas
lentils
and
potato
plants
arthur
leslie
s
big
estate
was
given
up
to
raising
food
for
hungry
mouths
and
this
little
corner
of
it
showed
but
a
part
of
the
changes
that
had
come
to
highland
house
since
the
beginning
of
the
war
it
was
the
second
week
of
may
and
lucy
gordon
was
in
england
though
only
a
few
miles
from
london
this
quiet
countryside
seemed
very
peaceful
but
that
was
only
when
you
looked
up
at
the
clear
bright
sky
or
across
the
green
fields
to
watch
the
people
at
their
daily
tasks
was
to
see
that
not
one
of
them
from
school
children
to
old
men
and
women
was
for
one
moment
idle
or
forgetful
of
the
burden
each
had
to
share
certainly
lucy
could
not
forget
it
but
she
often
thanked
the
constant
work
for
the
distraction
it
gave
her
anxious
thoughts
it
was
two
months
since
her
father
now
colonel
gordon
had
been
ordered
from
his
home
station
at
governor
s
island
in
new
york
harbor
to
the
western
front
his
departure
had
followed
quickly
her
brother
bob
s
convalescence
after
his
german
captivity
and
on
top
of
it
had
come
her
mother
s
decision
to
put
her
knowledge
of
the
care
of
the
sick
and
of
children
to
some
use
in
the
country
which
held
her
son
and
husband
six
weeks
ago
gordon
had
sailed
to
join
english
and
american
workers
in
the
reclaimed
french
villages
behind
the
lines
and
with
her
had
gone
lucy
after
countless
prayers
to
her
mother
as
well
as
to
leslie
her
kind
and
sympathetic
cousin
henry
to
be
allowed
to
accept
her
english
cousins
invitation
and
remain
as
near
as
she
could
to
her
family
i
ll
take
care
of
her
sally
her
come
leslie
had
begged
for
her
in
those
last
hurried
days
at
governor
s
island
arthur
leslie
s
girl
will
love
to
have
her
there
and
it
s
tough
leaving
her
behind
even
at
your
mother
s
i
ll
be
back
and
forth
often
from
the
continent
you
know
and
can
bring
you
news
of
each
for
leslie
giving
up
the
active
superintendence
of
his
big
lumber
camps
had
organized
and
equipped
a
red
cross
unit
which
he
meant
to
accompany
to
the
french
front
in
the
end
he
had
his
way
and
gordon
only
too
glad
to
have
lucy
near
her
so
long
as
she
was
safe
had
given
her
consent
that
was
six
weeks
ago
and
they
had
passed
more
quickly
than
any
weeks
in
the
fifteen
years
of
lucy
s
life
for
since
coming
to
the
beautiful
surrey
home
of
her
unknown
english
cousins
she
had
worked
like
them
in
almost
every
waking
moment
and
longed
like
them
to
do
more
far
more
than
was
in
their
power
for
the
cause
of
the
allies
presently
janet
roused
herself
to
say
thoughtfully
as
she
blinked
up
at
the
sun
it
is
harder
for
lucy
than
for
us
because
her
family
are
all
away
our
brothers
are
gone
edie
and
my
father
but
we
both
have
our
mothers
mum
wants
to
join
cousin
sally
this
summer
lucy
so
perhaps
we
ll
be
left
alone
you
know
your
mother
wrote
how
few
there
are
over
there
to
help
and
how
many
of
those
poor
french
children
are
without
homes
i
wish
i
were
old
enough
to
lucy
s
eyes
flashed
instant
response
to
her
cousin
s
words
in
spite
of
her
hard
daily
tasks
her
eager
restless
spirit
was
still
unsatisfied
and
she
dreamed
as
in
the
year
gone
by
of
greater
and
braver
efforts
that
s
so
assented
edith
lazily
opening
her
eyes
as
she
pondered
janet
s
first
words
of
course
janet
is
your
cousin
but
she
s
scotch
and
english
and
you
re
american
is
all
your
family
in
france
lucy
s
william
said
lucy
smiling
to
herself
as
a
little
figure
came
before
her
mind
s
eye
with
the
name
he
s
my
brother
at
my
grandmother
s
in
connecticut
but
my
father
is
with
the
so
is
mother
is
behind
the
she
sighed
but
a
quick
realization
of
the
truth
made
her
add
more
cheerfully
still
it
s
a
lot
to
be
as
near
to
them
as
i
footnote
american
expedition
to
france
i
should
think
so
exclaimed
janet
sitting
up
with
a
sudden
return
of
energy
at
sight
of
a
quick
moving
figure
among
the
gardens
think
if
you
d
been
left
way
off
in
she
turned
to
her
cousin
as
she
spoke
with
a
look
of
real
understanding
for
already
frank
generous
janet
felt
a
warm
friendship
for
the
courageous
little
american
and
found
in
lucy
no
less
a
devotion
than
her
own
to
the
allies
cause
here
comes
mary
lee
she
said
nodding
toward
the
advancing
figure
of
a
tall
girl
of
eighteen
dressed
like
themselves
in
khaki
working
suit
time
s
up
i
the
two
rose
quickly
to
their
feet
and
gathered
up
rakes
and
hoes
time
mary
asked
edith
lingering
for
a
final
stretch
it
seems
about
ten
minutes
since
we
came
out
from
it
s
a
whole
hour
lazybones
said
mary
lee
smiling
as
she
showed
the
watch
on
her
tanned
wrist
i
want
you
three
to
finish
hoeing
the
corn
over
here
if
you
with
no
great
enthusiasm
but
with
obedient
alacrity
the
young
shouldered
their
hoes
and
walked
off
across
the
grass
for
the
junior
war
workers
were
under
orders
and
submitted
like
good
soldiers
to
discipline
for
days
after
her
arrival
in
england
lucy
had
marveled
at
the
organization
which
had
marshaled
thousands
of
schoolboys
and
schoolgirls
in
efficient
squads
under
the
direction
of
their
elders
and
told
them
off
for
countless
duties
throughout
the
land
since
she
herself
became
a
member
of
the
army
of
war
workers
she
had
gardened
for
endless
hot
weary
satisfying
hours
she
had
mended
linen
and
sewed
on
buttons
in
the
wardrobe
room
of
the
base
hospital
and
had
canvassed
the
countryside
with
janet
in
the
little
for
eggs
and
other
delicacies
promised
for
the
sick
and
wounded
it
was
extraordinary
the
amount
of
work
that
could
be
got
at
no
great
hardship
from
one
willing
and
active
girl
and
when
the
three
got
together
it
really
seemed
as
though
they
accomplished
something
in
spite
of
all
lucy
s
unsatisfied
longings
it
was
four
o
clock
and
the
sun
had
commenced
to
throw
long
shadows
from
the
oak
trees
on
the
grass
when
mary
lee
called
to
the
dozen
girls
busy
here
and
there
among
the
gardens
to
stop
work
for
the
day
phew
breathed
janet
pushing
back
the
thick
dark
hair
from
her
hot
face
and
stepping
gingerly
along
the
well
cultivated
row
of
tiny
green
shoots
i
know
what
i
m
going
to
do
i
m
going
in
to
lie
down
on
my
sofa
and
just
be
perfectly
worthless
until
it
s
time
for
tea
perhaps
i
ll
play
with
the
kitten
but
nothing
more
lucy
said
nothing
but
inwardly
she
knew
what
she
should
do
at
the
noon
rest
she
had
only
skimmed
over
bob
s
letter
and
now
it
fairly
burned
the
pocket
of
her
khaki
blouse
she
had
not
seen
her
brother
since
they
said
on
the
governor
s
island
dock
in
september
she
shouldered
her
hoe
and
followed
quickly
in
her
cousin
s
footsteps
waving
to
edith
who
had
started
homeward
through
the
grove
as
lucy
and
janet
set
off
toward
the
house
half
an
hour
later
bathed
and
free
from
clinging
chunks
of
surrey
earth
lucy
was
sitting
in
the
of
her
bedroom
in
the
beautiful
old
house
beside
the
bay
window
her
soft
fair
hair
was
smoothly
brushed
and
tied
with
a
black
ribbon
and
her
khaki
uniform
changed
for
a
blue
linen
dress
with
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
she
took
bob
s
hastily
written
letter
from
its
envelope
and
settled
back
among
the
cushions
to
read
dear
old
lucy
hope
you
are
not
too
homesick
for
the
it
s
no
use
so
cheer
up
and
do
all
you
can
to
help
but
i
know
there
s
no
need
to
tell
you
that
i
am
as
well
as
possible
and
as
you
may
imagine
frightfully
busy
since
the
boches
began
their
last
big
slugging
at
our
lines
i
can
t
tell
you
where
i
am
but
it
is
i
m
sorry
to
say
nowhere
near
mother
or
dad
so
i
haven
t
seen
either
of
them
for
a
month
i
hope
you
got
my
last
letter
telling
the
good
news
that
i
brought
down
my
first
german
plane
i
am
a
pilot
at
last
and
a
first
lieutenant
with
some
sweet
little
nieuports
of
my
own
that
can
do
wonders
in
the
air
cousin
henry
watched
me
fly
the
other
day
his
work
brought
him
near
here
last
week
and
he
gave
me
news
of
mother
which
i
was
awfully
glad
to
get
transportation
in
these
parts
is
pretty
crowded
just
now
and
letters
come
through
slowly
i
shouldn
t
be
surprised
if
you
heard
from
her
oftener
than
i
do
cousin
henry
like
the
trump
he
is
is
working
for
all
he
s
worth
time
and
money
are
nothing
for
him
to
give
where
they
will
help
and
i
wish
i
could
write
you
some
of
the
fine
things
he
has
done
i
didn
t
see
him
long
for
we
are
on
pretty
constant
duty
now
and
most
of
my
outlook
lately
consists
of
german
trenches
seen
eight
thousand
feet
below
me
with
shrapnel
spouting
up
from
them
like
fireworks
i
float
around
among
the
clouds
and
keep
out
of
reach
while
my
observer
makes
his
maps
or
gets
his
little
machine
gun
ready
if
the
german
taubes
come
buzzing
too
out
of
reach
lucy
murmured
with
a
quick
frown
not
if
i
know
him
and
a
worried
wrinkle
persisted
on
her
forehead
as
she
turned
to
the
last
page
the
yanks
are
doing
their
good
little
bit
on
the
battle
line
i
wish
there
were
more
of
us
but
we
re
not
to
be
despised
fritz
doesn
t
seem
to
think
so
anyway
from
the
bombing
he
gives
our
trenches
whenever
our
allies
give
him
a
little
respite
father
s
regiment
did
a
fine
piece
of
work
the
other
day
near
you
know
where
i
can
t
write
more
definitely
now
but
he
with
a
number
of
his
officers
was
recommended
for
decoration
by
the
french
divisional
lucy
s
forehead
cleared
a
little
over
this
and
her
serious
eyes
brightened
as
she
read
the
words
bob
had
only
written
a
few
lines
more
i
know
you
like
the
leslies
if
they
are
cousin
henry
s
sort
you
couldn
t
help
it
janet
s
brother
arthur
is
not
far
from
here
and
i
intend
to
meet
him
as
soon
as
we
can
manage
it
i
saw
him
last
when
i
was
ten
and
he
was
about
seventeen
i
haven
t
a
second
more
to
write
so
love
and
best
wishes
from
yours
as
ever
lucy
called
janet
s
soft
voice
outside
the
door
after
half
an
hour
had
stolen
by
aren
t
you
coming
down
to
tea
lucy
sat
up
and
recalled
her
thoughts
from
where
bob
s
letter
had
led
them
and
her
eyes
from
the
darkening
fields
and
woods
beyond
the
leaded
panes
i
m
coming
janet
she
answered
putting
back
the
letter
in
its
envelope
and
rising
swiftly
from
the
lucy
seldom
indulged
now
in
the
reveries
she
had
once
been
so
fond
of
they
were
too
apt
to
become
sad
ones
and
she
wanted
only
to
follow
the
example
of
her
cousins
and
do
each
day
s
work
cheerfully
rebellious
moments
came
and
this
last
half
hour
had
been
one
of
them
when
nothing
seemed
to
matter
but
the
endless
salt
waves
that
separated
her
from
all
she
loved
the
best
but
lucy
had
gained
stores
of
both
patience
and
courage
since
that
dark
day
in
december
of
the
year
before
when
bob
had
been
reported
missing
she
went
out
of
her
room
and
ran
down
the
wide
staircase
to
the
floor
below
the
big
on
the
right
had
most
of
the
furniture
removed
or
pushed
close
to
the
wall
to
make
place
for
bales
of
gauze
and
muslin
for
highland
house
was
the
headquarters
of
the
district
red
cross
chapter
beyond
the
was
the
library
and
there
a
table
at
one
side
was
set
with
kettle
and
teacups
and
the
jingle
of
china
and
silver
sounded
from
the
doorway
here
i
am
cousin
janet
i
hope
you
ve
kept
a
muffin
for
me
said
lucy
looking
inquiringly
at
the
table
and
at
the
small
lady
who
presided
at
it
with
fingers
of
course
we
have
declared
leslie
with
a
nod
and
smile
as
she
handed
lucy
a
cup
of
hot
milk
and
water
with
a
dash
of
tea
in
it
we
ve
kept
two
even
said
janet
pointing
to
the
muffin
plate
from
her
lazy
seat
in
a
big
chair
it
s
wonderful
what
an
appetite
hoeing
corn
gives
for
war
i
don
t
think
i
ll
ever
again
complain
of
food
at
home
sighed
lucy
as
she
sank
into
a
chair
she
had
learned
some
lessons
about
the
value
of
a
hearty
meal
during
those
eight
weeks
in
england
there
was
enough
to
eat
at
highland
house
but
it
was
simple
food
limited
to
each
one
s
needs
this
looks
wonderful
she
added
carefully
spreading
the
hot
split
muffin
with
a
slender
share
of
margarine
for
butter
was
an
unknown
luxury
outside
the
hospitals
that
must
have
been
a
long
letter
you
had
from
bob
remarked
janet
searching
her
cousin
s
face
for
signs
of
unusual
worry
or
homesickness
after
her
hour
s
seclusion
but
perhaps
you
weren
t
reading
it
much
of
the
time
no
i
wasn
t
said
lucy
i
was
thinking
you
sorts
of
things
but
everything
bob
wrote
was
pretty
good
news
he
s
a
pilot
as
he
told
me
last
week
and
doing
the
work
he
loves
to
do
he
spoke
of
seeing
arthur
very
soon
as
they
re
not
far
then
he
s
near
cantigny
said
leslie
quickly
for
that
s
where
arthur
is
at
mention
of
her
eldest
son
she
flushed
a
little
chiefly
with
pride
but
that
feeling
was
always
mixed
with
fear
and
more
than
ever
now
since
the
opening
of
the
great
offensive
arthur
leslie
had
served
for
over
three
years
had
received
four
wounds
and
had
been
decorated
with
the
victoria
cross
and
the
croix
de
guerre
in
his
mother
s
anxious
thoughts
it
seemed
almost
too
much
to
hope
that
he
should
be
longer
spared
lucy
glanced
up
at
leslie
s
face
in
that
moment
when
her
thoughts
were
far
away
from
the
and
the
cheerful
room
thinking
as
she
had
often
done
before
how
gay
and
merry
cousin
janet
must
have
been
in
the
happy
days
before
the
war
she
was
cheerful
still
in
spite
of
the
daily
crushing
weight
upon
her
but
her
lips
were
close
set
and
her
dark
eyes
had
a
sad
earnestness
behind
their
glancing
brightness
two
sons
and
her
husband
lucy
thought
that
s
one
more
than
mother
has
to
worry
come
children
leslie
said
rousing
herself
after
a
moment
let
s
go
in
and
get
the
gauze
cut
and
arranged
for
s
work
i
expect
a
good
many
will
be
the
two
girls
rose
obediently
and
as
they
did
so
the
ring
of
the
front
sounded
through
the
house
perhaps
that
s
some
one
come
to
help
us
suggested
janet
while
her
mother
putting
behind
her
the
dread
of
a
telegram
from
the
war
office
said
more
likely
it
s
old
fry
with
those
eggs
she
promised
to
collect
for
she
turned
as
she
spoke
to
learn
from
the
servant
who
the
visitor
was
the
newcomer
however
did
not
wait
for
announcement
but
came
straight
on
and
in
another
moment
henry
leslie
walked
into
the
room
cousin
henry
cried
lucy
and
janet
in
one
amazed
breath
he
carried
his
hat
and
gloves
still
in
his
hand
and
his
kind
bright
face
was
heavily
marked
with
weariness
and
anxiety
your
boys
were
both
well
too
were
his
first
words
as
he
met
leslie
s
eyes
you
re
not
on
leave
again
so
soon
lucy
faltered
and
as
she
spoke
a
dreadful
fear
clutched
at
her
heart
and
she
caught
tight
hold
of
janet
s
shoulder
as
she
stood
beside
her
only
for
two
days
was
leslie
s
still
unsmiling
answer
and
as
lucy
s
frightened
eyes
searched
his
he
reached
out
for
her
hand
and
took
it
in
a
warm
clasp
let
me
speak
to
this
child
a
minute
janet
he
said
to
leslie
and
the
next
moment
she
and
janet
had
left
the
room
and
lucy
was
staring
pale
and
trembling
into
his
face
were
the
thoughts
that
whirled
through
her
brain
yes
lucy
dear
i
have
bad
news
for
you
said
leslie
in
answer
to
that
unspoken
question
bob
is
safe
thank
god
but
your
father
is
seriously
wounded
now
be
brave
little
girl
he
added
as
lucy
s
hand
grew
cold
beneath
his
clasp
leading
her
to
a
chair
he
made
her
sit
down
and
knelt
beside
her
listen
to
every
word
i
say
for
i
can
t
waste
a
the
awful
dizziness
in
lucy
s
brain
seemed
to
subside
a
little
in
a
dazed
sort
of
calmness
she
forced
herself
to
listen
your
mother
is
only
twenty
miles
away
from
him
but
that
stretch
of
twenty
miles
is
impassable
just
now
there
are
not
trains
enough
to
carry
shells
and
reinforcements
to
our
hard
pressed
trenches
and
bob
farther
up
the
line
where
the
press
is
hardest
on
the
american
front
can
not
desert
his
post
your
father
wants
most
awfully
to
see
one
of
you
and
you
are
the
only
one
i
can
reach
now
i
ve
got
permission
where
it
seemed
impossible
i
m
going
to
take
you
to
him
there
was
not
the
slightest
doubt
of
lucy
s
consent
in
leslie
s
words
and
there
was
no
longer
any
fear
or
shrinking
in
the
hazel
eyes
from
which
lucy
shook
the
tears
before
she
met
his
gaze
while
he
spoke
she
had
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
and
the
promise
made
when
bob
came
out
of
german
captivity
never
again
to
give
way
to
despair
seemed
suddenly
very
hard
to
keep
but
she
stopped
trembling
and
sat
erect
for
months
she
had
breathed
the
atmosphere
of
brave
endurance
now
the
thought
uppermost
in
her
mind
was
this
i
must
think
only
of
father
how
we
can
get
to
him
most
aloud
she
asked
when
do
we
start
cousin
henry
you
re
a
brick
said
leslie
but
under
his
breath
for
his
own
voice
would
not
obey
him
just
then
at
sight
of
lucy
s
pale
and
face
he
managed
to
say
we
must
leave
here
by
seven
o
the
next
two
hours
seemed
all
one
hurried
flight
to
lucy
with
dinner
forced
upon
her
which
she
choked
down
somehow
and
cousin
henry
and
janet
hovering
about
her
with
hopeful
words
and
tender
sympathetic
hands
and
eyes
that
would
fill
up
with
tears
in
spite
of
them
then
hurried
farewells
and
the
train
that
drew
up
in
the
gloom
of
the
little
station
after
that
came
the
long
ride
to
dover
it
was
not
more
than
a
few
hours
but
to
lucy
it
was
endless
it
seemed
to
her
that
days
already
had
gone
by
when
in
the
darkness
of
the
first
hours
of
the
morning
she
felt
beneath
her
feet
the
gangway
of
the
ship
that
was
to
carry
them
across
the
channel
and
here
for
a
moment
she
forgot
her
surroundings
and
stood
on
the
deck
silent
and
motionless
all
at
once
she
seemed
to
have
come
very
close
to
the
great
for
borne
through
the
misty
darkness
she
heard
for
the
first
time
clearly
audible
the
distant
thunder
of
the
guns
the
water
was
whipped
into
choppy
waves
by
the
shifting
wind
and
lucy
standing
by
the
cabin
window
at
leslie
s
side
saw
the
dim
lights
of
dover
bob
up
and
down
as
the
ship
got
under
way
the
cabin
and
decks
were
crowded
with
people
officers
and
men
returning
to
duty
from
brief
leaves
at
home
as
well
as
a
number
of
nurses
and
women
war
workers
of
various
kinds
more
than
one
of
these
cast
a
friendly
pitying
glance
in
lucy
s
direction
but
they
were
strangers
to
her
and
she
could
not
so
much
as
return
their
smiles
just
then
the
courage
she
had
so
resolutely
summoned
up
at
highland
house
was
fast
sinking
she
dropped
down
in
the
chair
leslie
offered
her
in
a
secluded
corner
and
sheltered
by
the
darkness
enforced
by
lurking
submarines
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
and
cried
until
the
tears
ran
down
between
her
fingers
leslie
let
her
alone
for
a
while
but
presently
she
felt
his
arm
steal
about
her
shaking
shoulders
and
raising
her
wet
face
she
faltered
suddenly
ashamed
i
guess
i
m
a
coward
cousin
henry
but
i
couldn
t
help
i
guess
you
re
a
coward
was
the
quick
answer
and
as
he
had
done
months
before
the
day
he
promised
to
go
in
search
of
bob
in
prison
leslie
sat
silent
and
patted
his
little
cousin
s
shoulder
with
a
tender
comforting
hand
his
thoughts
went
back
to
his
own
little
daughter
whom
lucy
s
unselfish
care
and
comradeship
had
restored
to
health
and
strength
it
isn
t
always
easy
to
be
brave
lucy
he
said
at
last
not
for
the
bravest
of
gradually
lucy
dried
her
tears
and
tired
out
now
almost
beyond
the
power
to
think
she
leaned
back
in
her
chair
and
fell
half
asleep
but
even
in
her
dreams
her
father
s
face
appeared
before
her
she
could
see
plainly
his
clear
gray
eyes
and
bronzed
cheeks
she
saw
him
again
as
he
stood
on
the
governor
s
island
dock
the
day
he
left
to
join
his
regiment
and
soldierly
in
the
uniform
which
always
seemed
a
part
of
himself
and
which
he
had
worn
for
years
the
dream
was
almost
a
reassuring
one
even
when
she
woke
for
it
seemed
somehow
as
though
her
father
must
still
be
determined
and
confident
but
on
top
of
this
came
the
bitter
certainty
that
when
leslie
had
said
he
wants
most
awfully
to
see
one
of
you
he
had
shrunk
from
adding
before
he
at
last
she
made
up
her
mind
to
ask
the
question
until
now
evaded
where
is
father
wounded
cousin
henry
she
whispered
he
received
a
bullet
through
the
lungs
his
regiment
pushed
ahead
five
hundred
yards
against
heavy
odds
and
took
the
enemy
s
leslie
bent
down
toward
his
little
cousin
as
he
spoke
but
a
slow
nod
was
her
only
answer
at
daybreak
calais
was
but
a
few
miles
distant
lucy
went
into
a
cabin
to
wash
her
face
and
returning
to
leslie
s
side
was
persuaded
to
eat
a
sandwich
and
drink
a
glass
of
milk
the
precautions
observed
during
the
crossing
were
cast
aside
and
with
the
french
coast
in
plain
sight
beyond
a
narrow
blue
stretch
of
water
tramping
feet
filled
the
decks
and
windlasses
began
hauling
goods
up
from
the
crowded
hold
an
hour
later
after
interviews
in
which
leslie
showed
his
papers
half
a
dozen
times
over
to
curious
officials
he
and
lucy
walked
down
the
gangway
onto
the
quay
france
flashed
across
lucy
s
tired
mind
with
even
then
a
thrill
as
slowly
her
eyes
wandered
over
the
varied
crowd
of
officers
and
men
french
british
and
americans
intent
on
landing
and
getting
their
effects
ashore
while
stores
were
lowered
after
them
onto
the
docks
american
soldiers
in
campaign
hats
not
yet
exchanged
for
the
steel
helmets
french
guards
with
vigilant
eyes
on
everything
around
them
british
officers
and
tommies
with
here
and
there
a
big
highlander
in
kilt
and
hurried
about
their
business
shouting
what
must
be
said
in
tones
loud
enough
to
rise
above
the
clamor
to
which
the
continuous
firing
from
the
front
made
a
dull
rumble
of
accompaniment
it
was
a
wonderful
picture
but
it
all
seemed
strange
and
indistinct
to
lucy
at
that
moment
her
mind
was
too
oppressed
with
grief
to
have
a
keen
realization
of
what
was
going
on
around
her
mechanically
she
followed
her
cousin
s
lead
and
found
herself
in
a
bound
for
the
calais
station
half
a
dozen
english
and
as
many
american
officers
shared
the
crowded
seats
the
americans
were
strangers
to
her
and
she
was
glad
of
it
the
ride
was
short
and
then
after
an
hour
s
wait
they
were
on
board
a
train
again
still
crowded
in
with
soldiers
and
war
workers
leslie
urged
lucy
to
try
to
sleep
a
little
but
she
could
not
the
guns
were
like
thunder
in
the
first
mutter
of
an
approaching
storm
and
they
were
nearing
the
storm
every
moment
about
her
sounded
shouting
voices
as
the
slow
train
moved
on
with
frequent
jolting
stops
and
whistled
signals
beyond
the
windows
a
lovely
spring
sun
shone
down
on
the
french
fields
and
orchards
and
as
the
train
followed
the
french
coast
line
toward
boulogne
her
tired
eyes
brightened
at
sight
of
the
lovely
scene
unfolding
on
every
side
here
was
france
unconquered
undespoiled
still
in
the
beauty
of
its
springtime
as
in
the
days
of
peace
the
guns
pounded
at
its
doors
and
passed
and
repassed
endlessly
to
its
defense
through
a
world
of
green
meadows
and
apple
blossoms
women
and
children
thronged
the
fields
hard
at
work
cultivating
the
ripening
crops
they
stopped
to
wave
friendly
greetings
to
the
soldiers
in
the
train
near
every
farmhouse
grew
a
little
orchard
laden
with
pink
and
blossoms
through
the
open
windows
lucy
caught
whiffs
of
the
sweet
air
and
closing
her
eyes
a
moment
could
not
believe
she
was
nearing
the
great
after
an
hour
they
left
the
countryside
behind
to
enter
boulogne
and
in
the
noise
and
confusion
of
the
big
station
leslie
insisted
on
lucy
s
getting
down
with
him
for
something
to
eat
it
was
a
hurried
meal
taken
among
a
crowd
of
traveling
officers
and
soldiers
for
the
train
made
only
a
short
stop
a
quarter
of
our
journey
is
over
leslie
told
her
trying
to
put
a
little
hopeful
encouragement
into
his
voice
when
they
had
started
on
their
way
again
only
a
day
ago
lucy
thought
as
head
on
hand
she
stared
out
at
the
flowery
meadows
while
the
train
continued
its
slow
way
south
this
journey
had
held
for
her
all
that
was
marvelous
and
unobtainable
in
fancy
she
had
made
it
more
than
once
with
quickening
breath
and
beating
heart
to
be
in
the
very
field
over
which
bob
had
flown
so
boldly
the
land
where
the
allies
stood
undaunted
but
now
she
no
longer
looked
with
pleasure
at
that
lovely
landscape
outside
the
window
she
was
in
a
strange
far
country
america
was
thousands
of
watery
miles
away
and
her
father
lay
and
wanting
her
the
train
seemed
a
cruel
tyrant
as
it
lagged
along
and
she
saw
nothing
but
her
father
s
face
then
her
mother
s
tired
and
despairing
from
where
she
vainly
sought
to
reach
him
it
was
after
a
long
morning
s
travel
that
leslie
pointed
out
the
majestic
walls
of
amiens
cathedral
above
the
distant
town
lucy
nodded
silently
her
eyes
upon
the
noble
beauty
of
it
but
her
mind
wandering
eastward
beyond
the
noise
of
the
guns
until
now
merged
into
one
muffled
roar
seemed
all
at
once
to
break
apart
into
a
hundred
mighty
voices
overpowered
with
a
terrible
sense
of
dread
she
clasped
leslie
s
hand
for
comfort
and
felt
it
close
over
hers
with
a
kind
understanding
pressure
are
we
almost
there
she
asked
faintly
only
an
hour
more
when
we
ve
passed
amiens
was
the
hopeful
answer
then
a
short
ride
in
whatever
we
can
find
to
pick
us
up
and
we
ll
be
in
the
town
it
s
from
the
boches
only
two
days
communications
are
at
loose
ends
just
now
hold
on
a
little
longer
ve
been
such
a
trump
all
lucy
nodded
dully
half
deafened
by
the
guns
they
were
crashing
out
in
one
tremendous
thundering
volley
till
the
tearing
din
struck
on
lucy
s
ears
and
made
them
ring
and
tingle
while
she
shrank
back
more
than
once
as
from
a
blow
when
two
hours
later
they
entered
the
paved
streets
of
the
which
had
made
a
difficult
way
among
the
heaps
of
broken
stone
dropped
them
before
the
old
town
hall
over
which
the
red
cross
flag
now
floated
leslie
took
lucy
s
arm
and
led
her
up
the
wide
stone
steps
a
nurse
came
forward
and
some
men
in
uniform
but
lucy
hardly
saw
them
they
entered
a
great
hall
which
had
once
been
a
court
of
justice
but
now
was
a
crowded
ward
filled
to
overflowing
with
cots
on
which
lay
wounded
men
on
the
floor
lay
more
men
on
blankets
or
mattresses
and
between
them
stepped
nurses
and
orderlies
intent
and
earnest
without
time
to
so
much
as
lift
their
tired
eyes
at
sight
of
the
newcomers
a
surgeon
had
exchanged
a
few
quick
words
with
leslie
and
now
he
led
the
way
to
a
door
some
distance
down
the
ward
this
door
he
opened
and
after
glancing
inside
the
room
made
lucy
a
silent
sign
to
enter
lucy
was
trembling
from
head
to
foot
as
she
crossed
the
threshold
the
hand
that
clutched
at
leslie
s
left
red
marks
across
his
fingers
but
she
fought
desperately
to
hide
her
fear
as
she
raised
her
eyes
to
face
the
nurse
who
came
forward
from
beside
the
cot
at
one
end
of
the
little
room
she
might
have
spared
herself
that
effort
at
made
for
her
father
s
sake
colonel
gordon
lay
motionless
upon
the
pillows
his
cheeks
not
quite
hiding
the
deadly
pallor
of
his
face
his
breathing
was
quick
and
labored
and
his
eyes
were
closed
but
when
lucy
knelt
beside
him
and
forgetting
all
else
around
her
caught
his
responseless
hand
in
hers
for
a
second
his
lids
quivered
and
parted
and
the
wide
gray
eyes
looked
into
hers
then
the
lids
fluttered
down
again
and
behind
her
she
heard
the
surgeon
speaking
loud
against
the
roar
of
the
guns
say
he
will
hardly
know
her
now
he
s
but
half
lucy
bent
her
head
over
her
father
s
hand
and
the
tears
so
long
restrained
poured
down
her
cheeks
in
a
warm
salty
shower
sobs
choked
her
but
she
forced
them
back
or
buried
them
in
the
blanket
s
woolly
folds
then
the
hand
she
held
stirred
slowly
in
her
clasp
and
at
the
same
time
she
felt
a
soft
touch
upon
her
tumbled
hair
incredulous
she
raised
her
head
winking
away
the
tears
and
saw
her
father
s
eyes
fixed
full
upon
her
puzzled
and
uncertain
dimmed
with
pain
they
met
her
eager
longing
gaze
but
recognition
was
somewhere
in
their
depths
he
murmured
and
while
lucy
at
the
faint
smile
that
touched
his
weary
face
struggled
for
power
to
answer
him
he
added
clearly
poor
little
girl
i
wanted
so
to
see
you
it
was
hard
for
his
smile
had
faded
to
a
frown
of
pain
but
his
hold
on
lucy
s
hand
did
not
relax
and
she
suddenly
by
some
help
outside
of
herself
grown
strong
again
bent
down
and
spoke
close
to
his
ear
i
didn
t
mind
it
father
i
couldn
t
leave
you
here
to
get
well
all
could
it
really
be
her
old
cheerful
voice
that
spoke
for
voice
she
had
thought
never
to
hear
again
she
smiled
into
the
wondering
eyes
once
more
upraised
to
hers
and
went
on
confidently
you
re
going
to
get
well
father
dear
you
know
that
old
bullet
in
the
spanish
war
didn
t
get
you
and
neither
will
this
one
i
way
i
knew
that
bob
was
coming
back
even
when
the
germans
had
was
it
hope
or
only
longing
for
life
that
touched
with
a
new
light
the
eyes
until
now
so
dim
and
sombre
the
surgeon
leaned
forward
his
gaze
intently
fixed
on
the
wounded
officer
s
face
to
lucy
s
brave
and
resolute
heart
it
seemed
an
echo
of
her
own
prayers
as
though
her
father
felt
already
what
in
her
wakening
confidence
she
so
longed
to
make
him
he
was
not
going
to
die
chapter
ii
on
the
allied
front
a
good
little
nurse
lucy
gordon
that
s
the
way
to
talk
to
a
sick
man
said
a
strong
eager
voice
beside
her
as
lucy
left
her
father
s
room
at
last
a
long
hour
later
a
tall
young
army
surgeon
with
bright
blue
eyes
and
ruddy
freckled
face
had
crossed
the
ward
at
sight
of
her
lucy
looked
quickly
up
and
for
very
astonishment
her
heart
skipped
a
beat
while
a
slow
smile
lighted
up
her
tired
face
for
an
instant
she
was
at
home
again
on
governor
s
island
in
that
happy
time
when
her
family
had
all
been
together
was
it
only
two
years
since
captain
greyson
had
brought
her
through
the
was
it
a
hundred
years
anyway
he
was
a
major
now
from
the
leaves
upon
his
shoulders
was
it
you
in
there
all
the
time
she
asked
dazedly
i
never
that
s
not
surprising
said
the
officer
smiling
he
took
lucy
s
arm
and
led
her
through
a
doorway
into
a
little
ruined
garden
lit
by
the
afternoon
sunlight
here
s
a
bench
sit
down
until
miss
pearse
brings
you
out
something
to
thankful
beyond
words
for
the
presence
of
this
old
friend
to
care
for
her
in
her
utter
weariness
lucy
dropped
down
upon
the
stone
seat
and
looked
again
into
major
greyson
s
face
i
m
glad
to
see
you
she
said
simply
do
you
there
a
she
could
get
no
further
her
shaky
voice
half
lost
in
the
cannons
roar
but
major
greyson
bent
down
to
catch
her
words
yes
there
is
and
don
t
stop
for
one
moment
thinking
it
was
his
swift
answer
as
he
looked
at
lucy
with
keen
honest
eyes
there
s
more
of
a
chance
since
you
talked
with
him
than
since
he
was
wounded
there
s
a
tide
in
the
succession
of
weary
days
when
nature
needs
hope
and
nothing
else
to
keep
up
the
battle
and
by
jove
you
plucky
little
girl
you
brought
it
i
cry
again
thought
lucy
fighting
for
she
clenched
her
hands
together
with
all
her
strength
while
a
solitary
tear
dropped
down
upon
them
major
greyson
saw
her
struggle
and
prompted
by
a
heavy
burst
of
firing
from
the
french
and
american
batteries
in
front
of
began
to
speak
of
the
town
s
capture
things
are
still
in
poor
shape
and
everything
you
see
we
ve
been
in
possession
only
since
tuesday
he
said
glancing
about
the
little
garden
cluttered
with
fallen
stones
and
rubbish
to
where
through
a
gap
in
the
battered
wall
the
street
showed
beyond
we
had
a
hard
fight
to
get
it
but
strangely
enough
in
spite
of
the
heavy
bombardment
the
place
wasn
t
deserted
some
of
the
inhabitants
have
simply
stuck
it
out
german
occupation
and
all
it
takes
a
lot
to
drive
these
poor
french
people
from
their
but
weren
t
lots
of
them
killed
asked
lucy
amazed
not
those
who
hid
in
their
houses
at
the
further
end
of
the
town
it
was
the
poor
refugees
trying
to
get
out
of
the
place
between
bombardments
who
suffered
most
we
are
doing
all
we
can
for
them
leslie
has
worked
night
and
day
i
m
certain
since
the
opening
of
this
last
but
aren
t
the
german
lines
still
very
near
the
guns
sound
almost
on
top
of
us
said
lucy
her
voice
grown
scared
and
trembling
again
as
a
thunderous
explosion
hurt
her
ears
oh
their
lines
are
more
than
five
miles
away
those
are
our
guns
that
sound
so
close
said
major
greyson
reassuringly
he
glanced
over
lucy
s
shoulder
as
he
spoke
and
gave
a
nod
of
satisfaction
good
for
you
miss
pearse
he
said
that
s
just
exactly
what
she
needs
here
s
your
breakfast
and
luncheon
lucy
rolled
into
a
young
red
cross
nurse
with
brown
hair
curling
beneath
her
veil
and
lips
that
smiled
a
pleasant
welcome
at
the
little
newcomer
came
quickly
up
with
a
full
tray
which
she
set
down
upon
the
bench
miss
pearse
here
is
miss
lucy
gordon
said
major
greyson
nodding
in
lucy
s
direction
miss
pearse
has
promised
to
take
a
little
bit
of
care
of
you
lucy
if
you
re
not
too
big
now
to
be
taken
care
indeed
i
m
not
lucy
protested
rising
to
hold
out
a
friendly
grateful
hand
which
the
young
nurse
took
warmly
saying
perhaps
you
won
t
think
i
m
taking
much
care
of
you
when
you
see
what
i
ve
brought
miss
gordon
it
isn
t
even
a
lunch
but
we
re
rather
hard
up
oh
i
m
not
particular
smiled
lucy
thinking
back
a
day
to
tea
at
highland
house
and
to
what
she
had
thought
hardship
then
now
she
suddenly
discovered
that
she
was
dying
of
hunger
at
sight
of
the
eggs
and
bread
and
the
cup
of
chocolate
on
the
little
tray
when
miss
pearse
uncovered
the
dishes
sit
down
and
eat
it
all
urged
major
greyson
your
father
is
asleep
and
anyway
i
m
going
back
to
lucy
needed
no
more
urging
and
taking
the
tray
upon
her
knees
she
ate
the
little
meal
with
keen
enjoyment
and
a
great
feeling
of
returning
strength
in
both
mind
and
body
that
s
better
remarked
miss
pearse
ten
minutes
later
when
some
of
the
healthy
color
had
stolen
back
into
lucy
s
pale
cheeks
now
you
don
t
look
like
a
ghost
any
more
here
s
your
cousin
coming
to
find
she
pointed
to
the
doorway
from
which
leslie
was
just
coming
out
and
picked
up
the
tray
of
empty
dishes
saying
i
ll
take
these
and
go
back
for
you
won
t
be
alone
don
t
go
far
how
can
i
find
you
asked
lucy
anxiously
clinging
to
this
new
friend
in
the
sad
strangeness
of
her
surroundings
i
shan
t
be
more
than
a
hundred
yards
away
smiled
the
girl
nodding
toward
the
door
leading
to
the
big
crowded
ward
and
taking
up
the
tray
she
crossed
the
garden
stopping
to
point
out
to
leslie
the
bench
where
lucy
was
leslie
had
been
snatching
a
little
of
the
sleep
denied
him
for
the
past
hours
and
now
almost
rested
he
looked
better
than
when
lucy
had
first
seen
him
at
highland
house
her
spirits
rose
unaccountably
at
sight
of
his
more
cheerful
face
as
she
made
swift
room
for
him
on
the
seat
beside
her
major
greyson
said
father
get
better
were
the
eager
words
that
came
first
to
her
lips
she
scanned
leslie
s
face
for
confirmation
of
her
hopes
and
found
a
part
of
what
she
sought
in
the
slow
nod
with
which
he
answered
major
greyson
wouldn
t
have
said
it
if
it
were
not
true
and
more
than
that
he
told
me
he
had
hopes
thank
god
i
brought
you
dear
your
father
has
been
sleeping
quietly
ever
since
your
visit
he
longed
so
for
some
of
you
to
come
and
wondered
in
his
fever
where
you
oh
cousin
henry
lucy
cried
a
desperate
longing
rising
in
her
own
heart
how
many
days
before
mother
can
be
here
surely
the
trains
must
be
running
better
now
they
are
running
every
minute
of
the
day
and
night
but
not
just
along
her
way
which
is
and
mostly
they
are
freight
cars
crammed
with
men
and
munitions
being
rushed
to
where
they
are
most
needed
you
see
it
s
hard
to
tell
just
when
she
can
get
here
for
of
the
several
telegrams
i
know
she
has
sent
only
one
reached
lucy
sat
drearily
silent
it
won
t
be
many
days
though
m
sure
of
that
declared
leslie
speaking
in
a
more
hopeful
tone
after
having
put
the
facts
frankly
look
for
her
any
hour
and
you
may
be
just
as
right
as
i
am
and
now
see
here
he
added
rising
from
the
bench
and
holding
out
his
hand
i
want
you
to
come
and
get
some
sleep
you
won
t
be
any
good
to
your
father
if
you
are
all
worn
out
major
greyson
says
you
may
lie
down
in
the
nurses
resting
room
off
the
ward
i
promise
to
call
you
as
soon
as
your
father
sunset
was
streaming
through
the
narrow
windows
of
the
room
and
gleaming
on
the
old
stone
floor
when
miss
pearse
s
voice
calling
to
her
roused
her
from
sleep
the
colonel
is
awake
now
she
said
bending
over
the
cot
as
lucy
rubbed
her
heavy
eyes
lucy
sprang
up
struggling
to
collect
her
thoughts
as
she
followed
the
nurse
out
of
the
room
she
had
fallen
asleep
almost
as
soon
as
her
head
had
touched
the
pillow
and
now
awake
again
to
the
hammer
of
the
guns
upon
her
ears
she
marveled
at
it
she
smoothed
back
her
hair
remembering
dimly
that
she
had
not
fixed
it
since
that
morning
on
the
boat
and
wondering
how
long
before
people
living
in
a
place
like
this
could
learn
to
get
up
and
go
to
bed
as
though
they
lived
through
regular
peaceful
hours
miss
pearse
looked
as
neat
and
calm
as
the
young
nurse
who
had
taught
the
army
girls
on
governor
s
island
though
her
cheeks
were
flushed
just
now
with
weariness
after
a
long
hard
day
come
in
she
said
to
lucy
on
the
threshold
of
colonel
gordon
s
room
lucy
entered
softly
for
not
yet
had
the
uselessness
of
quiet
footsteps
in
the
midst
of
thundering
guns
occurred
to
her
and
went
to
her
father
s
side
his
long
sleep
had
lifted
a
little
of
the
shadow
from
his
pale
face
but
his
breathing
was
still
short
and
difficult
and
his
eyes
were
closed
lucy
s
heart
sank
miserably
as
she
looked
at
him
behind
her
major
greyson
entered
and
kneeling
beside
the
cot
clasped
the
wounded
officer
s
wrist
looking
keenly
into
his
face
father
said
lucy
at
last
her
voice
shaking
in
spite
of
all
she
could
do
won
t
you
speak
to
me
colonel
gordon
stirred
a
little
and
opened
his
eyes
for
a
moment
he
was
silent
then
as
before
a
smile
flickered
over
his
set
lips
and
taking
a
hard
breath
he
murmured
the
rest
was
lost
as
in
sudden
weakness
he
closed
his
eyes
again
and
turned
his
face
to
the
pillow
where
s
mother
did
you
say
entreated
lucy
bending
over
him
she
s
coming
father
truly
she
ll
soon
be
here
but
colonel
gordon
could
not
speak
in
answer
this
time
only
his
hand
moving
for
a
second
toward
lucy
s
arm
showed
that
he
felt
her
presence
lucy
turned
a
despairing
face
to
major
greyson
but
his
look
of
patient
hopefulness
had
not
changed
he
motioned
to
her
to
leave
her
father
s
side
and
when
with
a
backward
glance
at
that
still
figure
on
the
cot
she
had
obeyed
he
drew
her
outside
the
door
and
spoke
as
though
answering
her
question
it
s
all
right
i
didn
t
expect
any
more
this
is
the
worst
time
of
the
day
for
him
i
still
hope
and
have
every
reason
to
think
he
is
better
than
oh
major
greyson
lucy
faltered
vainly
seeking
to
put
her
thoughts
into
words
the
surgeon
led
her
out
again
into
the
little
garden
over
which
darkness
had
now
begun
to
fall
unbrightened
by
lights
from
the
sombre
streets
of
the
town
lucy
looked
up
at
the
first
twinkling
stars
in
the
clear
sky
and
they
seemed
the
only
familiar
things
in
all
that
dreary
desolation
you
re
tired
poor
little
girl
said
major
greyson
when
a
great
sigh
had
fallen
involuntarily
from
lucy
s
lips
miss
pearse
is
going
to
take
you
across
the
street
to
the
house
where
the
nurses
sleep
you
will
be
right
by
her
and
i
give
you
my
word
at
the
slightest
change
in
your
father
you
shall
be
sent
for
you
won
t
be
any
good
if
you
don
t
sleep
leslie
is
waiting
in
my
room
to
have
some
supper
with
you
it
was
soon
after
eight
o
clock
when
lucy
bade
her
cousin
henry
and
left
the
hospital
in
miss
pearse
s
charge
leslie
had
done
his
generous
best
in
the
past
hour
to
cheer
her
but
without
success
though
she
had
tried
hard
to
respond
to
his
kind
efforts
her
eyelids
were
like
leaden
weights
her
brain
seemed
to
have
no
thought
nor
feeling
left
in
it
and
she
crossed
the
street
which
was
cluttered
with
stones
and
débris
stumbling
as
she
walked
and
vaguely
wondering
if
all
this
were
true
miss
pearse
was
very
kind
and
helped
the
tired
girl
to
bed
with
gentle
hands
and
in
understanding
silence
but
once
in
her
narrow
cot
in
the
room
adjoining
that
in
which
miss
pearse
and
another
nurse
slept
lucy
s
dulled
mind
amazingly
awoke
and
flashed
before
her
pictures
of
everything
she
had
seen
and
done
in
the
past
day
and
night
the
pounding
of
the
guns
which
had
become
for
a
while
an
almost
unnoticed
part
of
her
surroundings
seemed
swelled
to
a
horrible
din
that
beat
like
hammers
on
her
forehead
and
not
even
with
her
head
buried
in
the
pillow
could
she
find
peace
enough
to
sleep
for
months
afterward
lucy
remembered
that
first
night
at
the
misery
of
her
loneliness
overwhelmed
her
as
she
lay
there
in
the
thundering
darkness
beset
by
fears
she
vainly
struggled
to
put
aside
afraid
to
look
back
at
what
seemed
peaceful
days
behind
or
ahead
to
what
might
come
at
last
she
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
sitting
up
in
bed
she
determined
to
go
and
beg
miss
pearse
s
company
tired
though
she
knew
the
poor
nurse
must
be
after
her
long
day
s
work
but
miss
pearse
had
not
quite
forgotten
the
lonely
little
girl
near
her
before
lucy
had
left
her
bed
she
heard
some
one
at
the
door
of
her
room
and
a
kind
voice
said
lucy
can
t
you
sleep
i
m
going
to
lie
down
on
your
bed
beside
there
was
not
much
room
but
lucy
made
all
she
could
with
a
heart
almost
too
grateful
for
speech
and
her
faltered
thanks
was
lost
in
the
roar
of
the
cannon
with
miss
pearse
dropping
off
to
exhausted
sleep
at
her
side
the
thoughts
that
had
tormented
her
weary
mind
faded
off
into
blankness
at
last
she
fell
asleep
when
morning
came
lucy
opened
her
eyes
and
found
she
was
alone
the
sun
shining
onto
her
cot
had
awakened
her
and
sitting
up
she
looked
soberly
around
at
the
bare
unfurnished
room
the
plaster
on
the
walls
was
cracked
and
fallen
stones
had
nearly
blocked
up
the
chimney
only
in
one
corner
hung
a
picture
as
though
forgotten
in
hurried
flight
it
was
of
a
dog
jumping
up
to
beg
with
ears
pricked
forward
and
twinkling
eyes
behind
his
silky
hair
lucy
smiled
at
it
wishing
it
were
alive
with
heavy
heart
she
shrank
from
facing
the
new
day
and
desperately
longed
to
fall
back
into
dreamland
but
unlike
the
night
before
she
felt
strength
enough
within
her
to
summon
up
her
courage
and
make
a
prompt
and
vigorous
effort
come
on
lucy
gordon
you
give
in
have
they
brought
you
this
near
the
battle
line
to
be
a
coward
or
are
you
going
to
help
your
father
and
scornfully
they
used
to
call
you
captain
lucy
like
alice
in
wonderland
she
was
fond
of
scolding
herself
and
could
do
it
as
effectively
as
any
one
else
could
have
done
it
for
her
close
on
top
of
the
scolding
she
got
up
and
in
her
anxious
eagerness
to
be
dressed
and
to
see
her
father
she
forgot
to
pity
herself
further
and
thought
more
than
anything
else
that
this
day
might
bring
her
mother
to
her
before
it
ended
but
if
only
those
guns
would
stop
one
minute
she
faltered
as
she
paused
in
her
dressing
to
cover
her
ears
half
deafened
by
the
double
bombardment
out
of
the
bag
so
hurriedly
packed
at
highland
house
she
selected
a
blue
gingham
dress
for
the
day
was
warm
and
sunny
she
gave
a
hasty
glance
at
her
in
the
little
mirror
she
had
brought
with
her
and
after
putting
the
bare
room
in
order
went
out
in
search
of
the
stairway
it
was
close
at
hand
beyond
the
adjoining
bedroom
the
foot
of
it
opening
directly
on
the
street
lucy
ran
down
it
the
sound
of
voices
coming
to
her
from
outside
above
the
cannons
noise
the
street
was
crowded
with
french
soldiers
together
with
a
scattering
of
americans
who
looked
very
much
a
part
of
things
as
they
passed
by
joined
in
friendly
groups
with
the
poilus
one
and
all
were
hot
dusty
and
loaded
down
with
field
equipment
for
there
were
few
just
now
and
these
men
had
been
sent
back
for
but
a
few
hours
respite
from
the
lucy
s
eager
shining
eyes
followed
each
american
soldier
as
he
passed
all
else
forgotten
but
those
dear
familiar
figures
until
two
women
coming
by
with
baskets
on
their
arms
stopping
to
smile
and
point
in
her
direction
recalled
her
to
herself
she
returned
their
smiles
as
cheerfully
as
she
could
wondering
much
at
the
patient
endurance
which
had
left
their
thin
faces
neither
frightened
nor
despairing
a
dozen
women
passed
her
as
she
stood
on
the
threshold
breathing
the
soft
spring
air
and
several
children
too
all
were
hurrying
intent
upon
their
errands
but
they
looked
quiet
and
not
seeming
even
to
hear
the
never
ceasing
explosions
which
forced
them
to
speak
loudly
in
each
other
s
ears
a
minute
later
lucy
caught
sight
of
miss
pearse
and
leslie
crossing
the
street
from
the
hospital
and
she
quickly
made
her
way
among
the
broken
paving
stones
to
meet
them
with
beating
heart
she
searched
both
their
faces
and
drew
a
sigh
of
relief
when
leslie
met
her
anxious
eyes
with
a
nod
and
smile
of
greeting
it
s
all
right
lucy
were
his
first
words
your
father
is
if
anything
better
he
is
waiting
to
see
you
he
looked
with
some
concern
into
her
face
which
was
pale
after
the
hours
she
had
lain
awake
but
she
smiled
with
quick
reassurance
don
t
say
i
look
tired
cousin
henry
she
begged
i
did
sleep
some
of
the
time
didn
t
i
miss
pearse
and
i
feel
perfectly
you
slept
more
than
i
expected
you
to
in
this
racket
said
the
nurse
frankly
it
takes
several
days
to
get
so
you
don
t
mind
that
s
putting
it
mildly
remarked
leslie
as
they
mounted
the
steps
of
the
quaint
old
building
crowned
with
its
two
gothic
towers
i
ve
been
near
here
for
several
weeks
now
but
to
tell
the
truth
i
m
not
used
to
it
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
into
colonel
gordon
s
room
and
as
lucy
entered
it
her
spirits
rose
with
a
sudden
great
rush
of
hope
her
father
s
eyes
were
open
and
for
the
moment
his
slow
heavy
breathing
did
not
contract
his
forehead
into
lines
of
pain
oh
father
she
said
gulping
down
a
wild
desire
to
cry
and
smiling
crookedly
instead
she
dropped
onto
the
little
chair
beside
the
cot
and
took
his
hand
in
hers
you
re
better
i
know
you
are
she
told
him
with
shining
eyes
hope
so
murmured
colonel
gordon
shifting
his
weight
cautiously
on
the
pillows
the
fingers
that
lucy
held
tightened
and
clasped
hers
and
her
father
looked
down
at
the
little
hand
in
the
blue
sleeve
lucy
he
said
slowly
as
though
making
an
effort
to
collect
his
thoughts
leslie
is
here
with
t
he
yes
s
right
outside
said
lucy
quickly
looking
into
her
father
s
eyes
she
saw
that
they
had
grown
clear
and
purposeful
in
spite
of
the
dark
shadows
of
pain
beneath
with
a
sudden
clearing
of
his
brain
he
spoke
more
quickly
you
ought
not
to
be
here
i
asked
for
you
when
i
was
too
far
gone
to
he
stopped
for
a
moment
listening
to
the
guns
they
re
not
far
off
our
lines
can
not
be
more
than
four
miles
away
you
must
go
back
to
oh
father
cried
lucy
breathlessly
you
won
t
make
me
go
back
as
soon
as
this
the
town
is
quite
safe
and
i
must
see
you
a
little
stronger
before
i
go
mother
will
be
here
soon
you
know
think
what
a
chance
it
is
for
help
you
to
get
well
don
t
you
know
how
i
ve
always
longed
to
help
a
smile
touched
colonel
gordon
s
pale
lips
as
he
answered
slowly
you
have
helped
little
daughter
i
ve
to
get
well
i
know
it
since
you
came
before
that
it
seemed
easier
not
he
struggled
for
breath
and
closed
his
eyes
terrified
lucy
started
up
but
her
father
s
fingers
still
clasped
hers
and
conquering
her
fear
she
sat
quietly
beside
him
until
footsteps
sounded
at
the
door
and
major
greyson
entered
all
where
you
are
he
nodded
his
eyes
on
colonel
gordon
s
face
the
sun
moved
slowly
across
the
floor
as
for
an
hour
lucy
sat
silent
and
motionless
until
her
father
s
fingers
at
last
relaxed
and
he
fell
into
a
quiet
sleep
miss
pearse
put
an
arm
about
lucy
s
cramped
shoulders
and
led
her
from
the
room
and
out
into
the
garden
you
poor
little
kid
you
haven
t
had
your
breakfast
she
said
pointing
to
the
tray
she
had
made
ready
and
set
on
the
old
stone
bench
we
ve
finished
long
ago
sit
down
this
minute
and
eat
and
i
ll
call
leslie
he
s
been
waiting
to
talk
to
lucy
thought
she
had
never
tasted
anything
so
delicious
as
that
breakfast
of
bread
and
army
bacon
she
could
not
stop
for
more
than
a
nod
to
leslie
when
he
approached
her
but
his
thoughtful
smile
had
a
look
in
it
as
though
he
had
plenty
to
think
over
while
he
waited
for
his
little
cousin
to
satisfy
her
hunger
at
last
she
put
aside
her
tray
and
he
sat
down
by
her
on
the
bench
drawing
some
papers
and
envelopes
from
his
pocket
i
m
going
off
lucy
he
began
to
attend
to
some
business
of
my
own
and
secondly
to
arrange
for
your
return
to
england
hold
on
a
minute
and
let
me
finish
he
said
quickly
as
lucy
showed
every
sign
of
interrupting
him
i
have
to
make
those
arrangements
a
day
or
two
ahead
if
you
are
to
get
through
with
as
little
delay
as
we
had
in
coming
here
these
papers
have
to
be
signed
by
the
proper
authorities
and
they
can
not
always
be
found
at
a
moment
s
notice
it
doesn
t
mean
that
you
must
leave
or
even
the
day
after
though
i
have
just
had
rather
a
debate
with
major
greyson
on
the
does
he
wish
me
to
go
asked
lucy
indignantly
no
i
ll
have
to
confess
it
was
i
who
made
the
suggestion
i
said
this
beastly
bombardment
was
too
hard
on
your
nerves
your
father
is
better
your
mother
is
on
her
way
here
and
you
ought
to
go
major
greyson
seemed
to
think
he
knows
you
better
than
i
he
declared
that
your
nerves
could
stand
the
strain
and
that
so
long
as
you
were
here
you
might
stay
two
or
three
days
longer
for
your
father
s
he
s
right
i
can
stand
it
exclaimed
lucy
with
a
quick
happy
smile
for
it
is
happiness
to
have
struggled
hard
for
courage
and
to
have
found
it
at
last
i
may
stay
cousin
said
i
might
she
pleaded
all
her
fear
and
loneliness
forgotten
in
renewed
longing
to
be
of
service
to
her
father
and
to
see
her
mother
again
if
only
for
an
hour
i
m
going
to
find
out
about
the
journey
back
was
leslie
s
cautious
answer
we
needn
t
decide
just
yet
on
the
time
for
as
we
shouldn
t
be
able
to
keep
to
any
schedule
we
shall
have
to
return
as
best
we
are
you
going
now
cousin
henry
which
way
asked
lucy
feeling
suddenly
very
at
the
thought
of
losing
his
brave
comforting
presence
to
amiens
to
american
headquarters
in
this
sector
some
time
and
back
here
night
the
distances
are
short
and
i
ve
already
booked
a
ride
in
a
to
amiens
i
know
you
re
in
good
hands
little
girl
he
added
rising
from
the
bench
and
taking
lucy
s
hands
in
his
miss
pearse
has
promised
me
to
take
care
of
you
and
major
greyson
is
right
on
the
spot
i
won
t
be
gone
longer
than
all
t
worry
about
me
said
lucy
summoning
the
ghost
of
a
smile
as
she
slipped
her
arm
through
his
and
walked
with
him
to
the
ruined
gateway
of
the
little
garden
all
around
the
gate
were
bursting
into
leaf
and
bud
as
though
this
spring
the
stones
of
the
wall
were
still
solidly
in
place
and
the
garden
paths
still
swept
and
tidy
outside
they
met
major
greyson
crossing
the
street
from
the
officers
mess
are
you
off
leslie
he
inquired
stopping
at
the
gate
then
with
a
frank
nod
of
cheerful
encouragement
at
sight
of
lucy
s
serious
face
he
added
we
ll
have
good
news
for
you
when
you
come
keep
your
eye
on
this
little
soldier
urged
leslie
trying
not
to
feel
anxious
at
the
moment
of
departure
don
t
worry
about
captain
yes
to
lucy
that
s
what
they
used
to
call
you
the
prompt
response
i
m
going
to
take
her
in
now
to
see
the
colonel
he
s
really
better
and
the
guns
have
slowed
down
a
they
can
hear
each
other
cousin
henry
said
lucy
still
lingering
at
the
gate
bring
mother
back
with
you
that
s
all
i
on
that
day
and
the
next
to
lucy
s
unspeakable
gratitude
colonel
gordon
continued
to
improve
slowly
he
came
back
from
the
shadowy
depths
of
unconsciousness
and
hour
by
hour
his
powerful
frame
gained
a
new
victory
over
his
desperate
weakness
his
heavy
hard
breathing
grew
gradually
more
natural
and
on
the
morning
following
leslie
s
departure
for
the
first
time
in
many
days
the
deadly
pallor
was
gone
from
his
thin
face
and
the
lines
of
pain
faded
from
his
forehead
as
he
slept
the
artillery
fire
had
slackened
on
both
sides
into
what
seemed
comparative
quiet
for
long
hours
lucy
had
sat
beside
him
a
silent
prayer
of
utter
thankfulness
in
her
heart
her
only
desire
that
her
mother
should
come
and
find
them
together
at
this
happy
moment
again
and
again
she
had
imagined
the
meeting
her
mother
s
tired
and
anxious
face
worn
with
a
long
journey
s
dreadful
apprehensions
and
the
swift
and
joyful
relief
of
the
good
news
awaiting
her
if
she
would
only
come
she
thought
on
the
evening
leslie
had
promised
to
return
fears
and
doubts
on
her
mother
s
account
began
to
trouble
her
though
miss
pearse
assured
her
they
were
needless
she
may
have
to
endure
a
hundred
tiresome
delays
on
the
road
but
she
will
not
be
in
danger
the
kind
young
nurse
persuaded
her
the
railroads
are
out
of
range
of
the
guns
just
have
patience
a
little
once
more
she
repeated
this
as
she
and
lucy
crossed
the
street
that
night
on
their
way
to
bed
leslie
had
not
yet
come
but
it
was
early
to
expect
him
whether
lucy
took
her
companion
s
words
to
heart
or
whether
she
was
too
sleepy
to
worry
about
anything
for
long
she
went
to
sleep
that
night
without
much
trouble
glad
of
what
was
really
a
lull
in
the
bombardment
for
several
hours
in
the
welcome
quiet
she
slept
peacefully
until
a
dream
began
disturbing
her
until
she
tossed
restlessly
on
the
hard
narrow
cot
the
dream
became
a
whirling
thing
about
some
mad
adventure
it
roused
her
almost
to
wakefulness
but
not
enough
to
know
she
was
awake
was
she
at
home
on
governor
s
island
the
drums
were
beating
wildly
in
her
ears
now
she
had
risen
into
the
bob
in
his
airplane
but
they
were
in
a
or
else
what
was
that
awful
thunder
she
sat
up
wide
awake
conscious
of
having
called
out
with
all
her
strength
miss
pearse
s
voice
spoke
to
her
from
the
door
did
you
call
lucy
don
t
be
frightened
i
was
coming
in
to
stay
with
she
shouted
but
lucy
could
not
hear
her
the
roar
and
crash
of
the
guns
was
like
the
noise
of
thunderbolts
above
the
thousand
of
them
together
miss
pearse
sat
down
on
the
cot
beside
her
and
spoke
into
her
ear
the
town
is
not
in
danger
but
the
firing
started
again
an
hour
ago
the
germans
have
begun
a
big
attack
for
miles
along
the
chapter
iii
a
glimpse
of
bob
knew
she
could
sleep
no
more
that
night
she
got
up
and
began
to
dress
with
pounding
heart
and
uncertain
fingers
there
was
no
use
trying
to
talk
miss
pearse
and
her
companion
miss
willis
were
also
getting
dressed
intending
to
return
to
duty
at
the
hospital
in
anticipation
of
heavy
casualties
from
the
front
dawn
was
just
breaking
through
the
shadowy
darkness
lucy
stood
by
the
open
window
her
ringing
from
the
quivering
air
and
thought
of
the
peace
of
a
surrey
morning
when
often
she
had
looked
out
at
dawn
on
the
quiet
woodland
and
of
the
first
soft
notes
of
the
birds
around
them
when
she
and
janet
had
started
out
early
to
their
gardens
if
she
were
only
back
there
as
this
thought
came
unbidden
she
tied
her
with
a
sharp
reproachful
jerk
and
answered
herself
with
genuine
scorn
is
this
what
all
your
longing
to
get
nearer
to
the
front
and
be
as
brave
as
bob
amounts
to
slacker
heavens
what
a
big
one
she
breathed
her
mind
distracted
from
all
else
as
a
mighty
explosion
shook
the
house
lucy
are
you
ready
asked
miss
pearse
in
her
ear
i
don
t
want
to
leave
you
here
alone
come
to
the
out
in
the
street
in
the
half
darkness
figures
of
men
were
hurrying
past
calling
to
each
other
in
scraps
of
french
or
english
that
went
unheard
in
the
increasing
uproar
the
eastern
sky
was
illumined
before
the
dawn
by
bursts
of
red
and
yellow
fire
and
the
air
smelt
thickly
of
smoke
and
dust
lucy
thought
dazedly
of
her
father
then
of
her
mother
remembering
thankfully
miss
pearse
s
confidence
that
she
must
be
further
from
the
guns
than
perhaps
leslie
might
be
with
must
surely
be
almost
back
by
now
lastly
her
anxious
thoughts
hovered
about
her
brother
and
could
find
no
comfort
there
was
bob
in
the
midst
of
that
awful
conflict
she
knew
he
was
since
the
attack
must
reach
as
far
as
cantigny
at
that
moment
though
it
did
not
seem
possible
that
such
a
bombardment
could
last
many
hours
outside
the
ward
major
greyson
was
talking
with
a
convalescent
infantry
officer
whom
lucy
knew
at
sight
of
her
they
both
came
forward
and
captain
lewis
said
close
to
her
ear
don
t
be
frightened
we
are
holding
them
well
half
of
this
infernal
racket
comes
from
our
own
guns
you
it
isn
t
pleasant
to
hear
though
is
it
lucy
asked
major
greyson
your
father
had
a
little
morphine
so
he
is
sleeping
he
s
doing
splendidly
think
of
that
instead
of
your
other
worries
it
will
soon
be
daylight
now
and
this
won
t
last
lucy
nodded
without
speaking
for
even
in
shouts
she
could
hardly
hear
her
own
voice
the
officers
left
her
each
bound
on
a
different
errand
and
she
followed
miss
pearse
into
the
nurses
the
first
shafts
of
light
were
stealing
through
the
narrow
windows
and
in
the
dusk
a
dozen
nurses
were
hurriedly
breakfasting
miss
pearse
made
room
for
lucy
beside
her
and
handed
her
a
plate
and
cup
a
general
haste
of
preparation
filled
the
air
as
they
ate
in
silence
the
bursting
shells
making
speech
next
to
impossible
other
nurses
and
orderlies
went
back
and
forth
outside
the
room
carrying
blankets
and
mattresses
in
a
last
effort
to
find
more
room
in
the
already
crowded
building
this
hospital
improvised
by
the
american
medical
corps
and
a
second
in
charge
of
a
french
staff
were
the
only
ones
in
and
the
need
had
grown
overwhelming
before
the
nurses
scattered
miss
pearse
brought
word
to
lucy
that
she
might
go
to
her
father
s
room
the
darkness
had
vanished
now
and
the
clear
light
of
dawn
filled
the
hospital
lucy
found
major
greyson
by
colonel
gordon
s
bedside
he
s
still
asleep
he
said
when
she
was
close
enough
to
hear
him
nodding
his
head
toward
the
quiet
figure
on
the
cot
his
pulse
is
good
and
he
breathes
easily
you
may
stay
here
a
while
if
you
may
wake
any
major
greyson
had
risen
from
the
chair
and
seeing
him
ready
to
go
lucy
hastily
asked
the
questions
that
were
trembling
on
her
tongue
major
greyson
where
do
you
think
mother
is
and
cousin
henry
promised
to
be
back
last
night
she
shouted
into
his
ear
as
he
bent
down
to
listen
but
the
bursting
shells
almost
drowned
her
words
he
nodded
quickly
to
show
he
understood
they
are
held
up
he
said
with
certainty
the
railroad
is
open
to
nothing
but
with
luck
they
may
manage
to
get
on
a
but
i
m
afraid
they
re
blocked
somewhere
along
the
road
you
mustn
t
worry
he
added
speaking
as
hopefully
as
he
could
in
a
voice
which
in
a
quiet
place
would
have
carried
across
a
field
they
are
well
out
of
from
the
front
than
we
lucy
sat
down
beside
her
father
thankful
that
he
had
slept
through
this
much
of
the
tumult
and
fell
to
thinking
of
bob
until
her
fear
for
him
grew
greater
than
her
courage
and
resolutely
she
tried
to
turn
her
thoughts
away
had
not
bob
come
back
once
from
deadly
peril
from
the
merciless
hands
of
the
enemy
remembering
her
own
despair
in
that
dreadful
december
of
lucy
never
failed
to
find
some
hope
for
her
brother
s
safety
her
father
did
not
wake
and
when
a
nurse
came
to
take
her
place
she
left
him
and
went
out
into
the
little
garden
the
sun
was
rising
gloriously
behind
the
clouds
of
dust
and
smoke
blown
from
the
batteries
before
the
town
the
pounding
of
the
cannon
seemed
for
a
moment
to
have
slackened
even
a
slight
lessening
of
the
din
bringing
a
quick
relief
to
her
tired
ears
down
by
the
ruined
gate
there
was
a
little
crowd
of
people
and
she
made
haste
to
join
them
they
were
doctors
nurses
and
convalescents
together
with
a
few
people
of
the
town
their
eyes
all
turned
toward
the
rising
sun
and
their
hands
lifted
as
a
shield
against
its
rays
what
is
it
asked
lucy
of
a
medical
officer
who
stood
beside
her
binoculars
in
hand
he
pointed
to
where
the
sky
was
touched
with
pale
rose
above
the
clouds
of
smoke
three
little
specks
were
darting
up
toward
the
blue
can
you
see
those
planes
the
germans
are
trying
hard
to
get
a
detailed
plan
of
our
new
batteries
their
airmen
have
been
up
for
hours
but
so
far
our
scouts
have
been
too
much
for
them
look
there
above
the
mounting
specks
appeared
two
others
seeming
to
pounce
down
upon
them
lucy
held
her
breath
as
the
newcomers
swooped
and
circled
closing
in
upon
the
three
below
until
a
feathery
cloud
cut
them
off
from
the
eager
watching
eyes
the
moment
of
suspense
among
the
little
group
changed
to
a
stirring
of
anxiety
and
disappointment
felt
rather
than
heard
in
the
cannon
s
roar
most
of
the
hospital
staff
members
tore
themselves
away
to
return
to
their
duties
but
lucy
could
not
take
her
dazzled
eyes
from
that
glowing
sky
half
unconsciously
she
followed
the
little
group
of
townspeople
who
seeking
a
place
in
the
open
away
from
the
pointed
towers
of
the
old
town
hall
moved
step
by
step
down
the
ruined
street
to
the
square
of
which
the
hospital
made
a
corner
the
sun
had
risen
higher
now
and
beneath
it
the
planes
were
again
visible
against
a
background
of
pearl
and
rose
as
they
gazed
breathlessly
up
at
those
moving
dots
that
were
men
in
desperate
struggle
one
of
the
planes
fell
swiftly
toward
the
earth
lucy
gave
a
quick
gasp
of
anguish
she
could
not
bear
to
watch
but
neither
could
she
turn
her
eyes
away
was
the
plane
just
brought
down
allied
or
enemy
she
inquired
of
her
nearest
neighbor
in
disjointed
shouts
of
french
but
the
woman
shook
her
head
sadly
knowing
no
more
than
she
was
bob
among
them
lucy
longed
most
to
know
that
for
better
or
worse
it
s
waiting
i
never
can
bear
she
had
said
to
marian
leslie
months
before
now
it
seemed
as
though
the
war
was
all
made
up
of
waiting
the
young
doctor
had
left
her
his
binoculars
but
she
found
it
hard
to
use
them
in
the
quivering
roar
of
the
guns
against
the
glaring
sky
if
the
airplanes
would
come
a
little
nearer
she
thought
she
could
find
out
something
that
wish
at
least
was
quickly
granted
out
of
the
distance
the
specks
grew
bigger
with
amazing
swiftness
lucy
winked
her
eyes
before
which
disks
of
red
and
black
were
dizzily
floating
from
the
glowing
sunlight
around
her
fingers
were
pointed
in
excited
gestures
and
her
ears
caught
fragments
of
shouts
and
exclamations
on
came
the
airplanes
until
in
what
seemed
but
a
breath
of
time
they
had
grown
to
big
winged
objects
that
hovered
in
plain
sight
far
overhead
but
not
a
mile
away
in
horizontal
flight
now
they
were
out
of
the
sun
s
path
and
the
watching
eyes
could
look
at
them
undazzled
there
were
six
as
nearly
as
lucy
with
fast
beating
heart
could
count
them
in
among
the
feathery
clouds
that
flecked
the
sky
the
little
crowd
had
gathered
to
three
times
its
size
and
for
all
the
thunder
of
the
guns
the
cries
of
the
excited
people
could
be
heard
in
their
anxious
expectancy
lucy
gave
a
quick
look
around
her
as
she
lowered
her
head
for
an
instant
to
ease
the
aching
muscles
of
her
eyes
and
throat
a
few
people
from
the
hospital
had
rejoined
the
crowd
and
familiar
faces
were
among
them
a
queer
sensation
of
having
caught
a
glimpse
of
some
one
intently
watching
a
keen
pair
of
eyes
looking
out
from
among
the
group
of
shawled
women
and
old
men
and
boys
gathered
from
the
her
glance
around
once
more
there
was
no
one
now
whose
gaze
was
not
turned
upward
and
she
looked
at
the
clouds
again
the
strange
impression
forgotten
the
six
planes
had
separated
into
two
groups
two
were
high
among
the
clouds
the
remaining
four
moving
here
and
there
below
them
of
the
four
one
was
clearly
out
of
the
fight
for
in
another
moment
it
turned
and
veered
off
in
the
direction
of
the
french
and
german
lines
sinking
slowly
as
it
flew
that
s
a
boche
said
a
voice
in
lucy
s
ear
captain
lewis
was
at
her
side
and
taking
the
glasses
she
held
he
leveled
them
at
the
sky
now
they
are
in
range
again
he
added
our
men
are
above
in
those
little
nieuports
the
boches
below
are
in
big
fokker
they
could
eat
up
our
little
fellows
if
they
could
reach
them
luckily
the
nieuports
can
keep
above
that
fourth
who
was
put
out
of
the
game
leaves
them
three
to
lucy
leaned
nearer
to
catch
his
words
for
in
his
preoccupation
he
forgot
to
speak
loud
enough
a
burst
of
fire
from
a
big
german
plane
made
one
of
the
nieuports
veer
sharply
from
its
level
poise
above
the
enemy
the
glasses
stiffened
in
the
young
officer
s
hands
but
in
a
moment
the
nieuport
righted
itself
and
rose
again
beside
its
fellow
from
the
french
trenches
guns
were
sending
shots
that
burst
below
the
german
craft
in
spouts
of
flame
but
they
fell
short
of
the
targets
the
gunners
evidently
fearing
to
hit
the
little
nieuports
so
close
above
them
as
the
battle
shifted
nearer
the
planes
flew
over
the
eastern
end
of
the
town
in
another
five
minutes
captain
lewis
seized
lucy
s
arm
saying
come
back
to
the
hospital
they
may
be
over
us
in
a
as
lucy
too
lost
in
that
terrible
and
thrilling
struggle
to
even
hear
his
words
stood
silent
and
unheeding
he
shook
her
arm
and
shouted
in
her
ear
come
on
look
here
s
the
patrol
come
to
break
up
the
crowd
you
can
t
stay
a
guard
of
a
dozen
french
soldiers
with
a
sergeant
had
arrived
to
disperse
the
people
who
oblivious
like
lucy
to
possible
danger
still
stood
gazing
spellbound
into
the
sky
even
when
ordered
with
shouts
and
unceremonious
gestures
to
get
under
shelter
they
walked
slowly
from
the
spot
turning
again
and
again
toward
the
clouds
among
which
the
five
planes
darted
each
pouring
a
deadly
fire
upon
its
enemy
lucy
got
back
somehow
into
the
hospital
garden
but
there
she
stopped
and
captain
lewis
seeing
the
planes
were
not
directly
overhead
stopped
with
her
they
were
not
alone
but
the
few
others
stood
like
them
in
tense
silence
watching
the
two
little
nieuports
still
swooping
about
their
big
opponents
in
quick
attack
or
momentary
retreat
and
every
watcher
awaited
with
eager
hopes
and
prayers
the
final
decision
lucy
s
racing
heart
beat
until
her
throat
ached
intolerably
and
her
head
began
to
swim
she
clutched
at
the
stone
heap
that
was
the
trying
to
quiet
her
panting
breath
suddenly
a
shout
went
up
around
her
one
of
the
big
german
fokkers
had
tilted
oddly
on
its
side
one
wing
was
drooping
helplessly
its
wire
supports
cut
by
bullets
and
now
flames
darted
from
the
body
of
the
plane
and
it
began
to
fall
lucy
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
then
an
arm
stole
around
her
shoulders
and
miss
pearse
s
kind
voice
said
in
her
ear
oh
lucy
don
t
tremble
so
i
know
it
is
awful
to
see
for
the
first
it
s
war
you
know
and
i
think
the
fight
is
ours
lucy
looked
up
again
not
trying
to
answer
the
german
plane
was
gone
a
quick
stir
among
the
little
group
told
her
that
things
were
happening
swiftly
at
that
moment
the
tide
of
battle
turned
the
two
enemy
biplanes
unwilling
to
remain
beneath
the
galling
fire
of
the
little
nieuports
which
hung
like
deadly
hornets
above
them
had
made
tremendous
efforts
to
rise
to
a
level
with
their
antagonists
but
fast
as
they
rose
the
lighter
planes
rose
still
faster
until
a
cloud
drove
in
between
allied
and
german
craft
concealing
each
from
the
other
only
the
germans
were
visible
to
the
watchers
below
they
evidently
saw
in
the
momentary
check
a
good
chance
of
escape
and
sped
off
swiftly
like
great
birds
through
the
bright
morning
air
toward
the
safe
shelter
of
the
german
lines
a
perfect
hail
of
fire
from
the
french
and
american
trenches
met
them
as
they
passed
this
perilous
frontier
puffs
of
smoke
and
balls
of
red
and
yellow
fire
enveloped
them
while
from
behind
the
drifting
cloud
the
nieuports
darted
in
pursuit
but
the
target
was
beyond
the
reach
of
the
gunners
the
german
planes
sailed
majestically
on
and
the
little
nieuports
remembering
that
discretion
is
a
part
of
valor
forbore
to
cross
into
german
territory
they
re
coming
back
they
re
quite
all
right
you
see
cried
captain
lewis
at
lucy
s
side
from
the
little
group
a
wild
cheer
went
up
at
sight
of
the
two
daring
little
scouts
returning
unharmed
from
a
battle
which
had
cost
the
enemy
dearly
without
the
compensation
of
a
glimpse
at
the
allies
defenses
they
are
looking
for
a
place
to
land
continued
captain
lewis
his
glasses
pointed
again
at
the
sky
one
fellow
has
a
badly
riddled
wing
there
they
are
going
to
land
on
that
big
meadow
just
outside
the
town
inside
our
as
he
spoke
the
nieuports
slowly
dropped
in
a
long
slanting
course
until
in
a
moment
the
hospital
towers
hid
them
from
sight
lucy
stirred
and
sighed
as
though
waking
from
a
dream
her
neck
and
shoulders
ached
so
she
could
hardly
straighten
them
and
her
eyes
were
almost
blinded
by
long
gazing
at
the
sunny
sky
she
looked
around
blinking
at
the
little
crowd
of
people
who
seemed
like
herself
slowly
coming
back
to
earth
to
take
up
their
tasks
again
the
street
had
once
more
filled
with
people
chiefly
women
who
had
paused
with
baskets
on
their
arms
oblivious
of
what
they
set
out
to
do
now
they
moved
on
with
hurried
steps
as
if
trying
to
overtake
the
time
lucy
suddenly
remembered
the
face
that
she
had
seen
watching
her
with
such
furtive
intentness
from
among
the
townspeople
in
the
square
the
impression
made
at
a
moment
when
she
was
too
preoccupied
to
give
it
any
thought
was
too
strong
to
be
forgotten
some
one
s
eyes
had
been
fixed
upon
her
with
a
piercing
earnestness
but
beyond
that
she
had
seen
definiteness
of
face
or
figure
in
the
midst
of
wondering
she
remembered
her
father
and
ran
back
at
once
to
the
hospital
colonel
gordon
was
awake
lying
quietly
upon
his
pillows
his
lips
set
and
his
eyes
keen
and
thoughtful
as
the
crash
of
the
bombardment
struck
his
ears
at
sight
of
lucy
he
smiled
and
held
out
a
welcoming
hand
but
the
searching
look
did
not
fade
from
his
eyes
and
his
thin
face
wore
some
of
the
old
confident
determination
that
lucy
so
well
remembered
for
a
moment
joy
at
the
change
in
his
appearance
overwhelmed
her
until
the
look
in
his
eyes
deepened
to
one
of
painful
anxiety
as
he
said
struggling
to
make
himself
heard
above
the
guns
you
must
go
can
t
stay
here
where
is
cousin
henry
eager
to
relieve
his
mind
lucy
shouted
i
m
going
cousin
henry
will
be
back
or
major
greyson
says
he
is
held
up
somewhere
like
mother
you
s
on
her
way
here
too
i
m
going
back
to
england
just
as
soon
as
he
can
take
me
anyway
the
germans
haven
t
got
ahead
a
bit
and
the
bombardment
is
letting
captain
lewis
she
stopped
breathless
wondering
if
the
firing
really
had
slackened
as
in
her
ears
the
merciless
pounding
still
continued
colonel
gordon
s
face
remained
unchanged
and
drawing
lucy
down
to
him
he
kissed
her
saying
send
major
greyson
to
me
as
soon
as
he
can
manage
it
you
are
going
back
now
if
it
is
any
way
lucy
went
thoughtfully
out
into
the
ward
and
meeting
major
greyson
sent
him
to
her
father
s
room
then
miss
pearse
found
her
and
took
her
off
to
lunch
at
which
she
sat
down
tired
and
famished
i
guess
you
are
hungry
remarked
the
young
nurse
helping
her
to
a
steaming
ladleful
of
cabbage
soup
i
would
lie
down
a
little
while
after
this
if
i
were
you
she
added
with
a
glance
at
lucy
s
flushed
cheeks
you
mustn
t
be
too
tired
for
your
journey
back
to
calais
for
i
m
afraid
it
will
be
a
long
and
tiresome
she
rose
from
the
table
as
she
spoke
in
answer
to
a
knock
at
the
door
almost
at
once
she
came
back
saying
major
greyson
would
like
to
speak
to
you
a
minute
outside
the
door
the
officer
gave
lucy
a
nod
of
greeting
and
spoke
quickly
i
wanted
to
tell
you
that
we
have
arranged
for
you
to
leave
here
morning
one
of
the
nurses
sent
back
for
rest
to
calais
is
going
too
i
can
t
stop
to
give
you
the
details
now
but
your
father
will
not
have
you
wait
for
leslie
in
case
he
does
not
get
here
he
gave
an
emphatic
nod
at
sight
of
lucy
s
troubled
face
he
s
right
you
know
leslie
would
have
taken
you
off
before
this
but
things
turn
up
so
quickly
one
can
t
plan
everything
go
back
and
eat
your
lunch
now
i
ll
see
you
lucy
went
back
and
sat
down
again
her
appetite
chased
away
now
that
departure
was
really
at
hand
her
thoughts
and
feelings
were
very
conflicting
longing
for
the
peace
of
surrey
and
its
freedom
from
the
terrible
sights
and
sounds
about
her
was
mixed
with
a
great
and
growing
sense
of
pride
and
satisfaction
in
her
nearness
to
the
heart
of
the
great
struggle
in
the
hope
that
she
might
be
of
service
to
the
cause
she
loved
so
well
thinking
these
things
she
choked
down
her
bread
untasted
wishing
desperately
that
her
mother
would
come
suddenly
something
struck
her
ears
like
a
great
shock
she
started
up
gasping
and
saw
that
the
nurses
had
started
up
likewise
but
now
they
were
dropping
back
into
their
chairs
with
faint
smiles
of
pure
relief
in
a
flash
she
understood
the
bombardment
had
ceased
not
died
away
to
utter
silence
but
compared
with
the
din
of
the
night
and
morning
the
scattering
fire
remaining
seemed
no
more
than
rifle
shots
miss
pearse
said
sit
down
lucy
it
s
stopped
thank
heaven
she
spoke
in
her
ordinary
tone
of
voice
and
lucy
answering
her
did
not
know
how
to
pitch
her
own
voice
and
half
shouted
uncertain
if
she
could
be
heard
is
it
all
over
she
stammered
wanting
to
cry
strangely
enough
and
swallowing
hard
to
keep
from
it
oh
i
don
t
know
was
the
doubtful
reply
be
thankful
anyhow
that
it
has
stopped
for
a
little
just
the
low
sound
of
the
voices
around
the
table
was
a
pleasure
after
the
fragments
shouted
in
each
other
s
ears
so
long
it
took
some
minutes
to
get
used
to
the
sudden
long
continued
noise
left
a
great
vacancy
not
at
once
filled
up
by
ordinary
sounds
the
nurses
hurried
through
their
meal
and
rose
one
by
one
to
go
back
to
their
duties
outside
the
door
a
nurse
whom
lucy
did
not
know
had
come
up
and
was
speaking
to
miss
pearse
they
came
down
on
that
biggest
one
right
outside
the
town
lucy
heard
her
saying
just
two
of
them
one
of
the
airplanes
had
a
badly
cut
wing
i
stopped
to
see
them
as
i
was
coming
back
from
the
farmhouse
with
the
orderly
after
getting
old
mère
breton
s
eggs
and
who
were
the
aviators
do
you
know
their
names
interrupted
lucy
forgetting
everything
but
her
eagerness
yes
said
the
nurse
turning
toward
her
with
a
pleasant
nod
and
a
look
of
curiosity
on
her
own
part
at
sight
of
the
little
stranger
one
of
them
is
captain
jourdin
of
the
french
flying
corps
the
other
is
an
lucy
s
heart
gave
such
a
bound
she
could
hardly
gasp
out
to
miss
pearse
the
wonderful
truth
your
lucy
the
nurse
exclaimed
are
you
sure
of
course
it
must
be
oh
i
m
sure
there
s
not
another
gordon
in
the
aviation
corps
how
can
i
get
to
him
who
will
take
me
cried
lucy
each
moment
s
delay
beyond
words
unbearable
i
ll
go
with
you
can
get
off
for
an
hour
we
ll
have
to
run
all
the
way
said
miss
pearse
in
one
hasty
breath
lucy
s
wild
eagerness
awaking
instant
sympathy
in
her
kind
heart
wait
here
until
i
get
she
was
off
as
she
spoke
leaving
lucy
standing
at
the
doorway
to
the
garden
trying
to
calm
her
whirling
thoughts
and
to
realize
the
truth
of
the
happy
chance
that
had
come
to
her
so
it
had
really
been
bob
all
the
time
whom
she
had
watched
with
such
desperate
hope
and
fear
as
he
fought
for
his
life
in
the
clouds
above
her
at
that
moment
it
seemed
days
and
days
since
she
had
risen
from
troubled
dreams
to
the
thunder
of
the
guns
that
morning
miss
pearse
came
up
behind
her
saying
all
on
together
they
ran
through
the
garden
and
out
into
the
street
it
was
a
mile
to
the
big
level
meadow
just
east
of
through
streets
heaped
with
fallen
stones
and
rubbish
the
houses
scarred
and
battered
by
flying
shrapnel
and
here
and
there
collapsed
in
utter
ruin
as
lucy
ran
on
tirelessly
looking
only
to
the
goal
ahead
thoughts
raced
tumultuously
through
her
excited
brain
until
her
father
mother
bob
and
william
the
past
and
the
uncertain
present
were
jumbled
together
into
a
maze
of
doubt
and
wondering
only
to
see
talk
to
everything
would
then
be
straightened
out
she
thought
of
captain
jourdin
what
ages
since
she
had
bound
up
his
injured
hand
on
governor
s
island
for
two
months
now
he
had
been
back
in
the
french
service
and
bob
s
letters
had
told
her
of
his
new
and
brilliant
exploits
how
bob
had
dreamed
of
having
a
part
in
all
this
that
was
now
coming
true
with
a
rush
of
strange
happiness
lucy
felt
that
she
herself
had
now
a
part
in
it
as
well
for
a
moment
she
had
forgotten
the
so
near
at
hand
tired
lucy
asked
miss
pearse
slowing
up
to
catch
her
breath
we
re
almost
the
streets
became
lanes
as
they
neared
the
outskirts
of
the
houses
thinned
to
scattered
cottages
set
among
neglected
all
empty
and
forlorn
for
this
side
of
the
town
had
been
most
exposed
during
the
bombardment
which
ended
in
its
capture
in
another
few
moments
they
passed
the
last
house
of
the
lane
and
beyond
what
was
left
of
a
grove
of
bright
green
poplars
opened
a
wide
grassy
meadow
it
stretched
with
several
others
in
broad
undulating
lines
as
far
as
the
wood
which
lay
between
the
fields
and
the
french
trenches
the
nearest
meadow
was
a
favorite
for
aviators
scouting
above
the
town
a
few
hundred
yards
to
the
left
a
little
crowd
of
people
had
gathered
around
two
airplanes
resting
on
the
grass
at
sight
of
them
miss
pearse
and
lucy
both
cried
out
with
the
little
breath
left
them
for
a
second
they
stood
still
panting
aloud
with
crimson
cheeks
and
hair
stuck
in
damp
wisps
to
their
hot
foreheads
then
they
ran
on
to
the
edge
of
the
crowd
which
had
collected
close
about
the
aviators
eager
to
offer
help
and
friendly
greetings
bob
gordon
was
standing
by
one
of
the
planes
his
hands
full
of
tools
his
gloves
and
helmet
he
had
flung
upon
the
grass
but
now
his
work
was
done
and
he
stood
idly
by
while
his
companion
put
the
finishing
touches
to
the
repair
of
his
wing
bob
s
face
was
hot
and
streaked
with
oil
and
dust
to
the
roots
of
his
brown
hair
his
sunburned
cheeks
were
thinner
than
when
he
had
left
west
point
less
than
a
year
ago
he
looked
calm
and
beyond
his
years
his
whole
lean
figure
filled
with
energy
and
decision
he
was
not
yet
but
to
lucy
he
seemed
a
boy
no
longer
the
crowd
made
way
for
her
in
astonishment
as
she
begged
and
pushed
her
panting
way
among
them
then
bob
turned
at
the
disturbance
and
caught
sight
of
her
his
face
was
a
study
of
unbelieving
wonder
and
delight
as
he
let
fall
the
tools
and
sprang
to
meet
her
lucy
flung
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
he
hugged
her
so
close
he
could
feel
her
heart
beating
as
she
fought
for
breath
for
a
moment
neither
of
them
spoke
a
word
lucy
too
breathless
and
bob
too
overcome
around
them
the
friendly
little
crowd
broke
into
delighted
cries
of
sympathy
and
pleasure
captain
jourdin
lifted
astonished
eyes
from
his
forgotten
work
and
miss
pearse
with
swimming
head
and
parching
throat
dropped
down
upon
the
grass
lucy
you
said
bob
at
last
drawing
back
from
his
little
sister
and
holding
both
her
hands
to
look
into
her
face
you
re
here
at
still
he
seemed
almost
incredulous
and
his
eyes
wandered
over
lucy
while
he
held
her
hands
as
though
he
thought
his
eyes
had
tricked
him
oh
bob
how
are
you
lucy
faltered
getting
her
breath
at
last
but
struggling
desperately
with
the
strangling
emotion
that
caught
her
at
sight
of
her
brother
september
long
ago
that
seemed
since
she
had
said
to
him
that
morning
at
governor
s
island
and
what
dreadful
days
they
had
been
through
since
then
bob
pulled
her
down
beside
him
on
the
grass
with
an
eager
searching
look
into
her
face
how
is
father
tell
me
that
he
s
better
lucy
answered
quickly
he
s
will
get
well
bob
whispered
and
lucy
seeing
the
lines
of
anxiety
that
had
chased
away
the
smile
about
his
lips
and
the
look
of
tired
suffering
in
his
eyes
almost
choked
before
she
managed
to
say
oh
bob
dear
he
s
safe
he
talks
to
me
just
like
himself
he
made
me
promise
to
go
back
to
england
illustration
this
meadow
is
the
best
and
is
she
bob
asked
after
a
moment
s
silent
thankfulness
lucy
s
words
had
brought
back
a
little
of
the
old
brightness
to
his
face
he
spoke
hurriedly
in
sudden
realization
of
the
short
time
they
had
together
then
as
lucy
shook
her
head
he
added
i
had
telegrams
you
know
one
reached
me
at
cantigny
from
cousin
henry
saying
you
had
come
to
father
and
that
he
had
improved
a
little
but
of
course
the
name
of
the
town
was
suppressed
so
i
didn
t
know
where
you
were
if
i
could
have
come
myself
i
should
have
learned
at
general
headquarters
where
father
was
but
i
never
thought
to
drop
down
on
the
lucky
spot
like
this
i
was
here
before
you
know
nearly
a
month
the
germans
took
the
town
this
meadow
is
the
best
around
the
little
crowd
of
people
had
dwindled
some
moving
off
to
leave
brother
and
sister
alone
together
for
miss
pearse
had
been
questioned
until
every
one
there
knew
the
story
of
bob
and
lucy
s
meeting
others
too
interested
to
go
still
stood
watching
with
smiling
faces
and
neither
bob
nor
lucy
minded
them
but
in
another
moment
lucy
sprang
up
from
the
grass
and
held
out
her
hand
to
captain
jourdin
he
took
it
with
a
quick
bow
his
face
lighting
up
as
he
returned
her
greeting
in
a
voice
deeply
touched
with
friendly
feeling
welcome
to
france
miss
lucie
i
never
thought
to
see
you
there
was
no
use
trying
to
put
into
words
the
strangeness
of
their
meeting
lucy
tried
to
say
a
little
of
what
she
felt
and
could
not
looking
into
the
frenchman
s
fine
grave
face
she
saw
again
the
land
by
the
on
governor
s
island
herself
and
william
standing
beside
a
sled
and
captain
jourdin
getting
out
of
his
stranded
airplane
and
limping
toward
them
she
had
told
him
that
day
of
bob
s
imprisonment
hoping
against
hope
that
he
could
give
her
encouragement
of
some
sort
for
his
safety
she
glanced
involuntarily
at
his
wrist
and
he
smiled
and
held
it
up
saying
you
see
it
is
quite
all
right
again
captain
lucy
you
are
back
in
the
s
better
than
anything
isn
t
it
she
said
at
last
and
his
eyes
lighting
up
at
her
words
told
her
the
depth
of
his
satisfaction
i
shall
not
soon
forget
that
american
surgeon
he
answered
softly
he
gave
me
back
to
lucy
said
bob
suddenly
from
behind
her
a
fellow
i
just
spoke
with
here
says
the
american
hospital

not
a
mile
away
i
m
going
to
see
father

run
all
the
way
how
about
it
jourdin
will
you
wait
half
an
hour
but
certainly
the
firing
has
almost
ceased
was
the
willing
answer
we
shall
have
a
quiet
night
so
it
appears
i
will
stay
here
on
guard
until
you
lucy
don
t
try
to
run
ll
kill
yourself
urged
bob
putting
his
arm
about
his
little
sister
s
shoulders
and
giving
her
an
involuntary
hug
stay
here
and
i
ll
be
back
as
soon
as
possible
this
man
who
told
me
where
the
hospital
was

run
bob
but
of
course

faster

said
lucy
reluctantly
hating
to
lose
her
brother
for
any
of
these
precious
moments
go
will
love
so
to
see
you
she
added
quickly
and
then
you
will
know
yourself
that
he
is
really
getting
her
words
were
hardly
spoken
when
the
heavy
crashing
boom
of
a
cannon
broke
the
quiet
of
the
german
lines
other
shots
followed
before
the
screaming
shell
had
burst
at
once
from
the
wood
in
front
of
the
meadows
the
french
and
american
guns
replied
the
bursting
german
shells
increased
in
number
and
now
once
more
a
thunderous
din
reëchoed
through
the
quivering
air
speechless
with
despairing
terror
lucy
threw
her
arms
about
bob
s
neck
and
he
held
her
while
he
shouted
in
her
ear
it
s
on
can
t
go
now
buck
up
there
captain
the
old
name
roused
lucy
s
sinking
courage
she
stood
erect
and
dazedly
saw
the
little
crowd
around
them
fast
dispersing
captain
jourdin
putting
away
the
tools
and
picking
up
his
helmet
and
miss
pearse
running
quickly
to
her
side
she
did
not
hear
the
words
the
nurse
shouted
but
she
heard
captain
jourdin
speaking
hastily
to
bob
get
back
to
the
squadron
before
the
fire
grows
time
to
shall
be
needed
if
the
german
lines
are
stiffening
before
the
these
fragments
caught
her
ear
she
understood
too
that
bob
was
in
greater
danger
if
he
delayed
and
that
was
enough
to
make
her
forget
everything
else
she
put
her
arms
about
his
neck
again
and
said
a
brief
hoping
the
shake
in
her
voice
was
drowned
by
the
cannon
the
next
moment
bob
was
seated
in
his
plane
leaning
down
to
her
for
a
final
a
mechanic
from
the
town
stood
ready
by
the
propeller
captain
jourdin
was
in
his
own
machine
and
now
he
turned
to
lucy
raising
his
hand
in
a
farewell
gesture
that
seemed
to
speak
his
own
dauntless
courage
in
another
moment
he
was
off
down
the
meadow
like
a
skimming
bird
bob
s
last
words
were
quickly
spoken
give
lots
of
love
to
cousin
henry
you
ll
go
back
to
england
he
shouted
lucy
had
not
even
had
time
to
tell
him
leslie
was
not
there
he
nodded
to
the
man
at
the
propeller
then
turned
to
lucy
once
more
do
you
know
whom
i
saw
in
a
month
the
roaring
propeller
drowned
his
words
begged
lucy
straining
her
ears
as
she
leaped
back
from
the
machine
but
bob
could
not
hear
her
either
she
saw
his
lips
move
though
not
a
sound
came
from
them
but
he
thought
she
understood
and
with
a
last
nod
and
smile
which
he
tried
hard
to
make
cheerful
for
that
lonely
little
figure
standing
there
brought
an
aching
pang
to
his
heart
he
pressed
forward
his
control
stick
and
sped
off
down
the
field
side
by
side
miss
pearse
and
lucy
watched
the
two
nieuports
rise
into
the
air
over
the
wood
soaring
far
above
the
bursting
shells
then
they
turned
and
with
one
accord
ran
swiftly
toward
the
town
while
the
thundering
guns
shook
the
earth
beneath
their
feet
chapter
iv
the
fortune
of
war
was
hardly
breaking
on
the
morning
of
may
when
lucy
woke
from
the
heavy
sleep
into
which
she
had
fallen
early
the
night
before
the
crash
of
the
bombardment
nor
the
ceaseless
anxiety
of
her
own
have
kept
her
awake
for
long
after
her
head
touched
the
pillow
the
evening
of
bob
s
visit
sleep
had
been
stronger
than
all
fears
though
now
she
wondered
that
it
had
ever
come
for
the
shock
of
the
battle
seemed
louder
and
more
terrible
as
it
struck
her
protesting
ears
miss
pearse
and
her
companion
were
already
up
and
lucy
hastily
dressed
herself
eager
to
learn
what
major
greyson
had
decided
about
her
departure
last
night
the
plan
had
still
been
unsettled
as
it
must
be
while
trains
and
motor
trucks
had
three
times
their
normal
work
to
do
it
was
a
bitter
disappointment
to
give
up
all
hope
of
seeing
her
mother
though
major
greyson
had
told
her
that
the
renewed
bombardment
might
last
for
days
and
that
leslie
would
have
reached
before
this
had
any
sort
of
undelayed
travel
been
possible
she
was
swayed
by
alternate
hopes
and
fears
as
she
brushed
her
hair
in
the
and
felt
about
on
the
little
table
for
her
comb
and
ribbons
it
was
so
desperately
hard
to
think
at
all
with
that
unearthly
noise
dazing
her
brain
but
in
spite
of
her
tormenting
uncertainty
she
clung
steadfastly
to
one
consoling
thought
she
had
helped
to
bring
her
father
out
of
danger
her
journey
had
not
been
in
vain
however
hopeless
her
longing
to
do
more
than
stand
weakly
by
watching
the
struggle
in
which
bob
and
the
rest
fought
so
gallantly
she
knew
she
could
here
on
the
last
year
it
seemed
impossible
that
she
could
do
anything
toward
winning
bob
s
freedom
and
yet
did
she
not
have
a
hand
in
sending
leslie
on
that
long
hard
journey
lucy
had
not
much
conceit
in
her
nature
but
she
did
have
a
good
deal
of
her
brother
s
confident
energy
and
her
courage
once
firmly
grasped
she
could
persevere
in
a
cause
on
which
her
heart
was
set
like
a
true
soldier
s
daughter
i
m
ready
miss
pearse
she
called
presently
waking
from
her
serious
thoughts
as
the
nurse
came
to
her
door
they
went
in
silence
down
the
stairs
into
the
street
for
this
morning
miss
pearse
did
not
try
any
of
her
usual
kind
and
encouraging
means
of
bolstering
up
lucy
s
cheerfulness
she
was
strangely
silent
and
preoccupied
in
the
street
a
hurrying
throng
of
soldiers
women
and
children
were
passing
by
dim
shadows
in
the
first
light
of
the
dawn
lucy
wondered
at
their
numbers
as
she
made
her
way
among
them
her
eyes
turning
with
a
fearful
fascination
toward
the
east
where
the
light
of
bursting
shells
outshone
the
pale
streaks
of
day
the
hospital
was
the
scene
of
a
great
though
orderly
confusion
almost
a
hundred
wounded
men
had
been
brought
in
during
the
night
and
every
spare
foot
of
space
had
been
used
to
lay
down
a
mattress
or
to
unfold
a
narrow
army
cot
doctors
orderlies
and
nurses
were
moving
in
every
direction
about
the
crowded
halls
and
lucy
stole
away
with
painfully
beating
heart
and
found
refuge
in
her
father
s
little
room
a
nurse
was
sitting
there
with
her
arms
upon
the
staring
out
into
the
shadowy
street
she
turned
pale
cheeks
and
troubled
eyes
toward
lucy
and
her
faint
smile
had
nothing
cheerful
in
it
as
she
rose
and
offered
her
a
chair
by
her
father
s
side
lucy
felt
a
pang
of
fear
at
sight
of
that
tired
face
the
nurse
looked
as
though
she
had
kept
an
anxious
watch
and
lucy
turned
searching
eyes
upon
her
father
fearing
a
change
for
the
worse
he
s
doing
well
the
nurse
said
in
her
ear
guessing
her
thoughts
and
she
accompanied
the
words
with
a
little
encouraging
nod
though
the
color
did
not
come
back
to
her
pale
cheeks
nor
the
apprehension
leave
her
eyes
lucy
sat
down
at
her
father
s
side
wondering
greatly
and
the
nurse
went
out
colonel
gordon
was
just
beginning
to
wake
but
for
a
few
moments
more
he
lingered
in
a
doze
at
last
he
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
at
lucy
with
a
slow
understanding
smile
of
recognition
you
little
daughter
he
asked
reaching
out
a
hand
what
time
is
it
anyway
it
s
not
light
yet
what
are
you
doing
here
then
as
the
full
force
of
the
guns
smote
upon
his
ears
and
brain
he
started
up
on
his
pillows
saying
with
quick
earnestness
you
re
going
they
ve
arranged
it
greyson
promised
me
henry
s
not
back
i
don
t
know
yet
lucy
answered
bending
over
him
to
be
heard
i
haven
t
seen
major
greyson
he
s
so
busy
but
i
think
he
s
going
to
send
me
off
some
time
just
then
it
was
real
happiness
to
hear
her
father
s
voice
so
full
of
energy
and
nearly
like
his
old
confident
self
she
smiled
and
forgot
her
worries
for
a
moment
in
all
colonel
gordon
s
eager
interest
of
the
evening
before
at
the
news
of
bob
s
visit
he
had
seemed
tired
and
restless
but
this
morning
even
lucy
s
unskilled
eyes
could
see
a
real
improvement
she
began
to
tell
him
about
bob
once
more
if
you
could
only
have
watched
him
yesterday
morning
in
the
air
father
you
ve
seen
him
fly
though
of
course
they
were
so
wonderful
he
and
captain
jourdin
keeping
after
those
big
german
planes
until
they
drove
them
home
he
looks
well
i
she
checked
herself
and
added
truthfully
but
he
s
thinner
than
he
she
did
not
tell
her
father
of
the
anxiety
bob
had
undergone
in
his
behalf
she
wanted
to
describe
his
surprise
at
their
meeting
but
the
effort
needed
to
talk
was
terrific
it
was
like
speaking
in
a
peal
of
thunder
soon
colonel
gordon
s
nurse
came
back
and
told
lucy
that
breakfast
was
ready
it
was
daylight
now
in
the
wards
where
the
workers
still
passed
from
one
patient
to
the
next
along
the
rows
of
cots
and
mattresses
lucy
glanced
down
the
long
room
with
a
little
shuddering
tremor
of
pity
and
horror
not
daring
to
look
too
closely
at
those
silent
bandaged
figures
but
in
the
depths
of
her
heart
the
longing
still
persisted
first
roused
months
ago
at
that
little
nursing
class
on
governor
s
island
to
do
something
to
help
from
the
stores
of
her
own
health
and
energy
she
went
on
into
the
nurses
rest
and
and
finding
no
one
yet
at
the
table
stood
by
one
of
the
quaint
narrow
windows
from
which
the
glass
had
been
shattered
long
ago
looking
out
across
the
garden
into
the
street
the
crowd
of
people
had
grown
dense
in
the
last
hour
now
it
was
entirely
made
up
of
townspeople
women
old
men
and
children
who
seemed
to
have
forgotten
their
orderly
routine
and
to
be
hurrying
blindly
through
the
streets
with
baskets
on
their
arms
and
bundles
on
their
shoulders
the
children
clung
to
their
mothers
skirts
with
looks
of
fear
and
bewilderment
in
the
few
minutes
that
lucy
stood
there
not
a
person
passed
by
going
toward
the
eastern
side
of
they
were
fleeing
from
the
toward
the
other
end
of
the
town
where
already
the
transport
lines
were
overloaded
until
not
a
horse
or
mule
was
to
be
had
for
miles
around
as
she
watched
a
deadly
fear
crept
over
lucy
s
heart
she
tried
to
stifle
it
but
could
not
her
eyes
did
not
deceive
her
and
had
not
miss
pearse
s
face
two
hours
ago
first
stirred
her
to
uneasiness
she
went
to
the
door
of
the
room
wondering
why
the
nurses
did
not
come
and
caught
sight
of
major
greyson
and
another
medical
officer
talking
earnestly
together
they
were
forced
to
speak
so
loud
that
the
words
came
plainly
to
her
ears
as
uncertainly
she
started
forward
it
s
impossible
major
exclaimed
the
younger
man
she
can
t
go
now
she
s
better
off
here
than
lost
in
that
raging
torrent
of
humanity
behind
the
town
we
may
a
shell
that
seemed
to
burst
over
the
hospital
itself
drowned
his
last
words
and
lucy
could
not
hear
major
greyson
s
reply
as
the
two
moved
off
together
her
heart
had
begun
to
pound
with
terror
and
she
longed
desperately
to
follow
major
greyson
and
find
out
the
worst
but
the
wards
were
a
place
of
battle
now
where
the
workers
strained
every
nerve
to
do
what
their
small
number
could
for
the
growing
hundreds
of
wounded
men
she
could
not
enter
it
yet
and
hastily
deciding
to
go
back
to
her
father
who
was
often
alone
in
these
crowded
hours
she
dropped
down
on
a
chair
for
a
moment
until
she
could
calm
her
frightened
breathing
she
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
and
while
she
sat
there
running
steps
came
up
behind
her
and
miss
pearse
fell
on
her
knees
beside
the
chair
and
caught
hold
of
lucy
s
hands
the
young
nurse
s
cheeks
were
deadly
pale
but
her
brave
honest
blue
eyes
met
lucy
s
frankly
she
took
the
terrified
girl
by
the
shoulders
and
spoke
close
to
her
ear
they
said
for
me
to
tell
you
but
you
ll
need
all
your
courage
so
don
t
you
let
it
go
oh
lucy
lucy
the
french
and
americans
are
far
outnumbered
they
are
retreating
on
both
sides
of
us
and
will
soon
be
inside
the
german
in
spite
of
all
her
her
voice
trembled
and
broke
and
for
a
second
she
hid
her
face
on
lucy
s
shoulder
while
the
two
clung
together
too
dazed
to
realize
at
that
moment
the
extent
of
the
catastrophe
lucy
tried
to
put
her
whirling
thoughts
together
and
make
this
awful
thing
seem
real
the
germans
will
take
she
told
herself
and
still
the
words
had
little
meaning
for
her
she
felt
that
somewhere
she
had
stopped
living
and
begun
to
dream
but
just
where
was
the
question
only
miss
pearse
s
face
recalled
her
a
brave
young
face
with
lips
tight
closed
to
hide
their
trembling
and
undaunted
purpose
in
her
clear
eyes
it
began
with
a
new
push
against
our
lines
at
argenton
lucy
heard
her
saying
they
ve
given
countless
lives
to
take
it
but
now
they
are
there
we
have
to
fall
back
to
straighten
out
our
line
it
was
all
in
an
hour
of
the
early
morning
of
the
battle
our
reserves
were
held
up
somewhere
and
the
germans
brought
two
divisions
for
every
one
of
ours
into
the
she
stopped
breathless
and
lucy
beginning
to
understand
asked
suddenly
all
those
people
running
by
can
they
get
away
not
unless
they
walk
for
is
no
other
chance
major
greyson
is
nearly
wild
because
you
have
not
gone
of
course
there
was
no
question
of
evacuating
the
have
to
and
i
have
to
stay
said
lucy
slowly
but
miss
pearse
did
not
hear
the
words
your
father
does
not
know
she
continued
they
have
given
him
something
to
make
him
sleep
and
he
is
a
sob
rose
unchecked
in
lucy
s
throat
but
in
a
moment
miss
pearse
had
drawn
her
to
her
feet
saying
earnestly
whatever
happens
we
must
look
ahead
and
hope
or
we
shall
have
no
courage
left
they
will
leave
us
in
the
hospital
you
know
we
shall
be
safe
enough
sounded
a
strange
word
to
use
lucy
thought
as
she
walked
dully
toward
the
table
she
tried
her
best
in
spite
of
that
numbing
paralysis
of
fear
to
capture
something
of
miss
pearse
s
calm
and
steadfast
bravery
but
that
hurried
breakfast
and
the
whole
morning
after
it
seemed
no
more
than
a
great
waking
nightmare
the
other
nurses
had
joined
them
for
a
few
hasty
mouthfuls
every
one
with
that
desperate
struggle
between
fear
and
courage
written
upon
her
tired
face
for
it
is
harder
to
be
brave
when
one
is
spent
with
weariness
and
none
of
the
nurses
had
slept
more
than
three
or
four
hours
out
of
the
since
the
opening
of
the
second
attack
when
lucy
was
left
alone
again
she
sat
on
the
staring
at
the
scene
outside
big
loaded
with
stores
and
equipment
were
making
their
difficult
way
through
the
streets
now
perched
on
top
of
the
loads
were
men
hanging
on
somehow
for
the
convalescent
patients
who
were
at
all
able
to
stand
a
journey
had
begged
or
stolen
transportation
for
a
few
miles
toward
the
rear
whence
they
could
strike
another
blow
instead
of
falling
into
the
enemy
s
hands
along
with
these
came
the
crowd
of
civilian
refugees
weighed
down
with
the
shabby
household
furnishings
that
meant
too
much
to
them
to
leave
behind
just
as
their
homes
had
meant
so
much
that
they
had
clung
there
in
desperate
hope
until
escape
became
all
but
impossible
the
straggling
lines
looked
sadly
unable
to
cover
the
long
hard
miles
that
lay
between
them
and
any
refuge
lucy
s
eyes
grew
blurred
with
tears
of
pity
as
forgetting
her
own
overpowering
fear
and
dread
she
watched
a
woman
shuffle
past
carrying
her
baby
as
well
as
bulky
bundles
of
clothes
and
bedding
after
her
toddled
two
other
children
one
of
them
no
more
than
able
to
walk
stumbling
helplessly
among
the
heaps
of
stone
oh
how
terrible
cried
lucy
burying
her
face
in
her
trembling
hands
with
a
quick
sob
then
she
thought
this
is
war
i
never
knew
what
it
was
until
in
another
hour
fragments
of
the
retreating
french
and
american
regiments
passed
through
the
town
field
artillery
too
whose
wheels
and
galloping
horses
were
almost
unheard
in
the
fire
of
the
german
guns
but
the
greater
part
of
the
troops
which
had
so
stubbornly
held
the
trenches
in
front
of
the
wood
retreated
around
the
edge
of
the
town
to
their
prepared
defenses
in
the
rear
preferring
to
abandon
at
once
than
to
submit
the
two
hospitals
to
a
prolonged
bombardment
toward
noon
the
noise
of
the
guns
seemed
to
lucy
s
aching
ears
to
have
grown
intolerable
too
restless
to
sit
still
she
visited
her
father
s
room
and
found
him
peacefully
asleep
she
was
glad
of
it
and
yet
she
longed
so
desperately
for
the
comfort
of
his
companionship
where
were
her
mother
and
cousin
henry
as
for
bob
she
dared
not
think
of
him
she
went
toward
the
door
leading
out
into
the
little
garden
the
street
was
filled
with
dust
but
the
lines
of
fleeing
people
had
passed
on
out
of
sight
she
stepped
onto
the
threshold
and
as
she
did
so
an
orderly
opening
a
box
of
red
cross
dressings
close
by
let
fall
his
tools
and
caught
her
arm
in
an
iron
grip
no
miss
not
another
step
he
shouted
lucy
stared
at
the
american
s
hot
tired
face
as
he
bent
toward
her
to
be
heard
in
the
uproar
he
was
a
hospital
corps
man
whom
she
had
spoken
with
often
in
the
past
few
days
now
in
excuse
for
his
rough
handling
he
beckoned
her
to
look
quickly
through
the
doorway
as
she
did
so
the
explosion
of
a
german
shell
threw
up
a
great
heap
of
stones
and
earth
not
two
hundred
feet
away
across
the
square
they
ve
got
our
range
he
said
close
to
her
ear
but
this
old
building
s
pretty
solid
it
will
stand
some
his
voice
was
steady
as
ever
and
lucy
looked
at
him
with
respect
and
admiration
in
her
frightened
eyes
longing
for
his
courage
but
he
had
faced
the
enemy
before
he
had
told
her
of
service
on
filipino
and
mexican
would
there
be
fighting
in
the
streets
in
which
the
germans
would
be
victorious
lucy
had
seen
fighting
once
in
the
streets
of
a
village
in
the
island
of
jolo
but
then
the
enemy
had
been
filipino
savages
quickly
overpowered
by
the
soldiers
and
she
had
been
too
little
to
do
more
than
cling
to
her
mother
s
skirts
in
wonder
as
she
turned
back
toward
the
street
another
shell
struck
a
house
close
to
the
hospital
leaving
a
huge
gaping
hole
in
the
brick
wall
when
the
smoke
and
dust
cleared
away
still
she
stood
frozen
to
the
spot
her
heart
beating
in
great
throbs
helplessly
waiting
for
she
knew
not
what
presently
major
greyson
s
hand
was
laid
on
her
trembling
arm
and
he
was
saying
come
away
from
here
lucy
come
into
your
father
s
it
was
the
only
spot
free
from
hurrying
workers
making
their
difficult
way
among
beds
too
close
together
even
here
cots
had
been
brought
in
and
made
ready
for
two
more
wounded
officers
colonel
gordon
still
slept
on
unconscious
of
the
day
s
calamity
and
lucy
breathed
a
quivering
sigh
of
misery
as
her
eyes
rested
on
his
peaceful
face
major
greyson
led
her
to
the
window
and
pointed
toward
the
sky
above
the
square
it
s
almost
over
he
said
these
last
shots
are
only
for
bravado
don
t
you
notice
the
slackening
of
the
fire
in
the
sky
the
clouds
of
dust
and
smoke
were
clearing
and
lucy
did
distinguish
a
lessening
in
the
terrific
wave
of
sound
its
quality
had
changed
too
as
the
german
infantry
engaged
the
retreating
troops
rifle
and
fire
was
mingled
with
the
bursting
shells
in
another
few
minutes
the
bombardment
had
sunk
to
single
explosions
at
irregular
intervals
even
at
that
awful
moment
the
relief
to
her
ears
seemed
almost
like
peace
our
batteries
in
the
wood
have
been
withdrawn
to
the
new
line
or
silenced
major
greyson
went
on
the
germans
will
stop
firing
until
their
airmen
get
the
range
he
took
lucy
s
hand
in
his
and
held
it
in
a
strong
clasp
we
ll
just
have
to
bear
up
lucy
shan
t
we
i
have
no
fear
for
your
courage
you
ve
got
the
good
american
stuff
in
sort
that
never
fails
we
ll
show
them
their
new
enemy
is
worthy
of
their
his
eyes
flashed
in
his
haggard
and
anxious
face
as
he
searched
the
street
with
watchful
gaze
we
ll
do
well
enough
here
you
know
they
ll
want
us
to
look
after
their
own
wounded
with
any
luck
in
the
our
troops
will
recover
the
at
these
words
a
great
flood
of
hope
swept
back
to
lucy
s
heart
the
germans
could
not
hold
then
she
be
brave
for
only
a
few
days
she
could
face
it
as
bob
would
do
suddenly
she
felt
major
greyson
s
hand
leave
hers
to
steal
about
her
shoulders
as
though
warning
her
to
summon
all
her
strength
of
will
she
looked
through
the
broken
window
and
that
arm
about
her
shoulder
tightened
up
the
street
were
advancing
a
squad
of
mounted
officers
figures
with
helmets
like
no
others
in
the
world
behind
them
came
a
company
of
infantry
the
noise
of
the
guns
had
died
down
almost
to
silence
lucy
s
throat
began
to
choke
her
until
she
pressed
one
cold
hand
against
it
struggling
for
breath
her
eyes
could
not
bear
to
look
upon
that
hateful
sight
and
still
she
could
not
force
herself
to
turn
away
on
they
came
another
company
behind
the
first
and
still
another
she
was
looking
at
the
kaiser
s
soldiers
servants
of
the
man
who
was
the
author
of
all
this
had
made
the
world
into
a
these
were
a
part
of
germany
s
army
of
the
greedy
power
which
had
roused
even
peaceful
america
at
last
in
furious
it
had
torn
apart
the
gordons
happy
home
sent
bob
to
prison
and
to
hourly
peril
and
brought
her
father
close
to
death
lucy
did
not
put
these
flying
thoughts
in
words
they
passed
through
her
mind
in
images
of
trembling
dread
and
bitter
indignation
from
the
hopeless
conflict
of
her
brain
a
despairing
sigh
escaped
her
lips
and
major
greyson
s
eyes
left
the
advancing
troops
to
look
at
her
come
lucy
be
a
soldier
he
begged
pity
shining
in
his
eyes
at
sight
of
her
white
face
struggling
for
composure
beneath
the
childish
mop
of
fair
hair
then
as
she
turned
her
wide
hazel
eyes
filled
with
a
desperate
resolution
upon
him
he
said
with
stubborn
confidence
this
isn
t
the
end
of
things
you
know
lucy
this
is
only
the
dark
hour
before
the
chapter
v
the
english
prisoner
major
greyson
spoke
both
he
and
lucy
turned
again
by
a
common
impulse
to
the
street
where
the
german
mounted
officers
had
advanced
as
far
as
the
square
in
front
of
the
hospital
lucy
looked
at
them
more
calmly
now
and
for
the
first
time
saw
ranks
of
and
motor
ambulances
following
in
the
wake
of
the
companies
the
men
too
who
at
her
first
terrified
glance
had
seemed
only
pitiless
visitors
were
not
formed
into
the
full
strength
of
companies
they
marched
in
column
of
fours
but
the
columns
were
short
and
straggling
ones
the
men
s
step
was
slow
and
heavy
their
gray
uniforms
thickly
covered
with
mud
and
dust
and
more
than
one
bandaged
arm
or
head
showed
among
them
they
crossed
the
broken
pavement
of
the
square
with
the
springless
tread
of
utter
weariness
no
light
of
triumph
in
their
faces
as
they
came
to
a
halt
in
front
of
the
old
town
hall
of
the
recaptured
town
huh
pretty
well
done
for
ejaculated
major
greyson
a
kind
of
exultation
in
his
voice
as
he
stepped
back
from
his
place
by
the
window
not
much
of
the
conquering
hero
left
just
now
i
must
go
to
the
officer
in
charge
lucy
we
are
likely
to
have
a
hundred
or
so
of
german
wounded
quartered
on
with
a
last
reassuring
pat
on
her
shoulder
he
left
the
room
and
lucy
stayed
alone
by
the
window
in
a
moment
the
nurse
stole
in
behind
her
and
after
a
glance
at
colonel
gordon
joined
her
in
a
silent
fascinated
watch
for
the
next
move
of
the
invaders
two
officers
had
dismounted
and
gone
up
the
hospital
steps
the
other
four
wheeled
about
and
rode
across
the
square
in
the
direction
of
the
mayor
s
office
and
the
french
hospital
not
a
human
being
except
themselves
was
to
be
seen
about
the
place
the
remaining
townspeople
did
not
come
out
to
act
as
audience
to
the
german
entrance
perhaps
the
conquerors
were
just
as
well
pleased
that
few
eyes
saw
the
second
half
of
the
column
the
soldiers
of
the
depleted
companies
at
a
second
order
now
sprang
forward
and
began
helping
to
unload
the
packed
with
wounded
and
to
assist
the
to
carry
their
burdens
into
the
hospital
some
of
the
ambulances
had
turned
across
the
square
toward
the
other
hospital
but
long
before
lucy
stopped
counting
the
wounded
men
the
nurse
beside
her
had
hurried
away
to
hear
her
part
in
the
tremendous
task
for
a
few
minutes
more
lucy
stood
there
but
she
was
no
longer
watching
without
purpose
her
fear
and
horror
she
had
resolutely
fought
down
not
down
for
good
but
under
her
control
she
saw
now
clearly
the
hard
inevitable
facts
that
was
in
german
hands
that
the
price
of
safety
for
the
people
in
the
her
father
and
the
other
wounded
soldiers
of
the
in
caring
for
the
enemy
s
wounded
and
that
the
task
was
very
great
she
was
here
in
the
midst
of
it
and
here
she
must
stay
she
was
strong
and
able
to
help
and
in
hard
work
she
saw
her
only
chance
for
any
peace
of
mind
with
a
determination
firmly
taken
she
turned
from
the
window
and
dropping
down
beside
her
father
s
cot
laid
her
face
for
a
moment
against
his
hand
he
stirred
a
little
as
though
about
to
wake
but
she
rose
cautiously
from
beside
him
and
with
a
last
look
as
though
for
courage
at
that
brave
soldier
s
quiet
face
went
out
into
the
wards
the
hospital
was
filled
with
german
soldiers
carrying
in
their
wounded
while
the
american
staff
did
all
in
their
limited
power
to
bring
order
out
of
the
confusion
lucy
took
but
one
timid
glance
among
them
she
caught
sight
of
miss
pearse
on
one
side
of
the
hall
kneeling
by
a
mattress
to
unfold
a
blanket
her
face
was
flushed
and
weary
and
her
eyes
bright
with
troubled
emotion
but
at
lucy
s
approach
she
looked
up
at
her
to
say
what
is
it
lucy
what
can
i
do
lucy
chopped
down
beside
her
and
spoke
quickly
knowing
how
little
time
could
be
spared
to
listen
that
s
what
i
came
to
ask
you
what
can
i
do
may
i
help
in
the
wards
you
let
me
do
something
i
m
strong
and
can
stand
a
lot
don
t
say
you
won
t
i
can
do
more
than
you
miss
pearse
smiled
faintly
at
the
eager
rush
of
words
of
course
i
shan
t
refuse
she
answered
and
her
eyes
met
lucy
s
with
a
silent
tribute
to
that
battle
for
courage
she
had
fought
and
won
you
can
t
work
in
the
least
not
now
but
there
are
oh
so
many
things
to
do
come
with
me
to
the
steward
s
in
after
days
when
lucy
had
time
to
think
it
over
she
dated
from
that
hour
the
change
in
herself
from
a
mere
bewildered
onlooker
at
the
mighty
struggle
to
a
real
sharer
instead
in
the
work
that
must
be
done
with
that
little
part
assigned
to
her
she
began
dimly
to
understand
the
secret
of
the
calm
determined
courage
of
those
about
her
they
had
their
task
to
do
and
nothing
must
turn
them
from
it
this
work
went
on
uninterrupted
while
the
germans
took
possession
of
the
town
not
a
very
imposing
possession
with
an
almost
decimated
battalion
of
which
the
survivors
had
been
hammered
into
exhaustion
by
the
dogged
french
and
american
resistance
but
their
presence
nevertheless
meant
everything
of
the
bitter
humiliation
and
helplessness
of
surrender
to
the
hospital
was
now
under
german
control
dependent
on
whatever
supplies
the
conquerors
accorded
them
in
fact
beneath
the
german
heel
just
now
however
the
hospital
was
as
much
a
german
as
an
allied
refuge
the
major
in
command
of
the
battalion
assigned
three
german
surgeons
and
a
dozen
orderlies
to
help
in
the
enormous
labor
of
caring
for
the
five
hundred
patients
crowded
into
the
old
town
hall
early
that
afternoon
lucy
started
out
under
german
orders
on
her
first
duty
in
company
with
a
french
convalescent
soldier
who
carried
two
empty
baskets
like
the
one
slung
across
her
own
shoulder
she
left
the
hospital
armed
with
permits
from
the
german
senior
surgeon
she
had
faced
the
new
chief
a
big
boche
with
red
face
and
bristling
eyebrows
and
had
obtained
his
kind
permission
to
walk
two
miles
in
the
sun
in
search
of
dairy
supplies
to
feed
the
german
wounded
but
if
food
for
the
enemy
were
not
forthcoming
the
allies
wounded
would
be
the
first
to
suffer
so
the
two
willing
helpers
the
little
american
and
the
poilu
he
still
pale
and
limping
as
he
walked
did
not
linger
on
their
errand
beyond
the
square
their
way
led
through
the
desolate
and
deserted
streets
where
the
bombardment
had
been
heaviest
this
was
the
part
of
from
which
the
inhabitants
had
earliest
fled
and
not
a
human
being
was
in
sight
not
even
a
pilfering
german
soldier
for
the
place
had
been
in
the
german
hands
before
and
they
well
knew
there
was
little
worth
stealing
left
in
it
lucy
s
heart
beat
hard
and
painfully
as
she
neared
once
more
the
broad
meadows
beyond
the
outskirts
of
the
town
how
short
a
time
it
was
since
she
had
gone
free
and
unmolested
to
that
field
to
give
bob
joyful
welcome
she
had
thought
it
hard
that
day
to
bear
the
ceaseless
roar
of
the
artillery
in
her
ears
yet
then
she
had
been
on
allied
ground
safe
in
the
power
of
those
she
loved
and
trusted
while
glanced
up
at
the
wounded
poilu
beside
her
and
suddenly
felt
ashamed
he
was
breathing
quickly
as
he
limped
along
for
it
was
not
a
week
since
he
had
left
his
bed
yet
he
had
begged
to
do
this
little
bit
to
help
his
comrades
she
was
so
well
and
strong
surely
she
ought
to
be
as
brave
as
he
just
then
he
broke
into
her
thoughts
look
mademoiselle
he
said
stopping
to
take
breath
as
he
pointed
on
ahead
there
is
the
boche
patrol
they
ll
want
our
papers
when
we
pass
so
get
em
at
the
corner
of
the
last
street
before
the
lanes
began
a
little
house
remained
almost
undamaged
before
it
paced
a
german
sentry
and
over
the
gabled
roof
the
red
white
and
black
flag
hung
lifeless
in
the
warm
still
air
lucy
hastily
drew
out
the
papers
from
her
blouse
for
the
sentry
at
sight
of
the
pedestrians
stopped
his
march
and
stood
in
the
narrow
street
to
bar
the
way
inside
the
open
door
of
the
house
a
half
dozen
figures
sat
or
stood
and
one
of
them
strolled
to
the
doorway
on
hearing
the
sentry
s
challenge
he
was
a
short
burly
captain
of
infantry
with
keen
bright
eyes
and
stiff
upstanding
hair
his
uniform
though
lately
brushed
still
dirty
and
after
the
desperate
encounter
of
the
past
three
days
he
glanced
down
at
lucy
with
a
look
of
surprise
as
he
held
out
his
hand
for
the
papers
which
the
sentry
ran
to
present
him
she
kept
her
eyes
on
the
ground
fearful
lest
some
of
her
thoughts
might
show
in
her
too
expressive
face
while
the
officer
looked
over
the
surgeon
s
permits
for
lucy
gordon
american
and
jean
brêlet
french
prisoner
of
war
to
pass
freely
for
the
good
of
the
german
hospital
corps
after
a
moment
he
gave
a
short
nod
and
handed
them
back
to
the
sentry
but
as
lucy
with
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
snatched
the
papers
from
the
sentry
s
hand
and
was
starting
on
again
she
was
stopped
by
an
imperious
gesture
from
the
doorway
a
second
officer
had
joined
the
first
and
while
speaking
he
nodded
his
head
inquiringly
toward
lucy
and
her
companion
the
infantry
captain
motioned
the
two
to
approach
the
steps
and
addressing
the
poilu
who
had
obeyed
the
summons
with
obvious
reluctance
asked
him
in
slow
labored
french
do
you
speak
any
german
brêlet
shook
his
head
with
emphasis
not
the
least
bit
in
the
world
he
said
exultantly
the
german
gave
him
a
quick
contemptuous
look
and
forbearing
to
continue
his
questions
turned
to
lucy
sprechen
sie
deutsch
fräulein
he
asked
with
a
shade
more
of
civility
in
his
masterful
tone
lucy
longed
with
all
her
heart
to
answer
as
the
poilu
had
done
at
that
moment
she
bitterly
repented
of
the
once
pleasant
hours
spent
in
the
company
of
elizabeth
a
german
servant
at
governor
s
island
when
she
had
learned
something
of
the
language
bob
refused
to
bother
with
in
her
uncertainty
and
confusion
she
stammered
out
the
truth
a
the
german
gave
a
nod
of
approval
the
irritation
fading
from
his
arrogant
face
without
a
word
or
glance
vouchsafed
to
brêlet
he
motioned
lucy
to
come
into
the
house
most
unwillingly
she
obeyed
with
a
backward
imploring
glance
at
her
companion
which
had
the
effect
of
making
the
good
fellow
start
boldly
forward
to
accompany
her
only
to
be
thrust
back
into
the
street
by
the
watchful
sentry
with
beating
heart
and
knees
that
shook
with
apprehension
lucy
mounted
the
few
steps
that
led
into
the
principal
room
of
the
old
house
the
officers
within
made
way
for
her
with
slight
bows
and
from
the
rear
a
feldwebel
or
sergeant
brought
a
chair
which
he
placed
beside
the
table
near
the
centre
of
the
room
the
captain
signed
to
lucy
to
sit
down
and
taking
a
seat
across
the
table
from
her
said
at
once
you
are
american
fräulein
what
are
you
doing
here
lucy
s
momentary
fright
and
weakness
had
swiftly
given
way
to
a
great
burst
of
hatred
and
indignation
at
finding
herself
subject
to
the
commands
of
these
triumphant
enemies
she
was
too
angry
to
be
afraid
and
it
was
in
a
confident
and
defiant
voice
that
she
returned
if
you
wish
me
to
understand
you
will
have
to
speak
more
the
german
glanced
up
at
her
with
an
air
of
surprise
a
faint
smile
at
the
corners
of
his
mouth
but
he
only
said
very
well
did
you
understand
my
question
yes
lucy
answered
looking
across
at
him
with
steady
eyes
i
came
here
to
see
my
father
who
is
badly
wounded
i
was
going
back
to
england
when
the
town
was
the
officer
nodded
without
comment
then
turning
to
the
sergeant
beside
him
he
ordered
bring
in
the
the
junior
officers
in
the
room
had
taken
seats
about
the
table
with
much
clumping
of
boots
and
rattling
of
swords
the
sergeant
opened
a
door
at
the
back
of
the
room
and
entering
it
returned
almost
at
once
preceded
by
a
tall
young
fellow
in
the
khaki
of
the
british
army
he
was
covered
with
dirt
and
dust
even
his
face
was
stained
with
mud
and
the
grime
of
powder
through
which
his
blue
eyes
shone
oddly
out
above
his
lean
sunburned
cheeks
he
looked
desperately
weary
almost
done
for
but
he
squared
his
shoulders
and
crossed
the
room
with
a
firm
step
lucy
bit
her
lip
until
it
bled
to
force
back
the
tears
of
sympathy
that
rushed
to
her
eyes
the
young
officer
was
not
more
than
twenty
years
old
and
how
terribly
like
bob
he
seemed
with
that
brown
hair
and
the
still
boyish
curve
about
his
lips
just
as
bob
must
have
appeared
when
he
too
tired
and
despairing
faced
his
german
captors
without
a
friendly
face
to
look
upon
she
met
the
young
englishman
s
weary
but
undaunted
gaze
with
such
a
look
of
eager
friendliness
that
he
stopped
short
and
for
a
second
the
cold
defiance
left
his
face
and
astonishment
confusion
and
a
kind
of
welcoming
light
played
over
it
but
it
was
hardly
a
moment
room
was
made
for
him
to
stand
before
the
table
and
the
german
captain
once
more
addressed
lucy
only
this
time
with
a
frown
of
annoyance
as
you
know
few
english
or
americans
speak
he
paused
as
though
this
fact
was
strange
enough
to
ponder
over
then
continued
as
it
happens
we
do
not
any
of
us
speak
english
for
that
reason
we
have
need
of
lucy
had
already
guessed
that
she
was
to
act
as
interpreter
and
this
knowledge
had
relieved
her
vague
fears
of
detention
or
imprisonment
but
now
her
thoughts
began
to
whirl
again
did
she
know
enough
german
to
fulfil
her
task
to
her
captor
s
satisfaction
more
troubling
still
would
she
be
asked
to
put
questions
which
the
young
englishman
would
not
answer
at
this
her
heart
leaped
with
a
sudden
confidence
if
there
was
any
game
of
wits
to
be
played
she
thought
that
she
and
this
boy
with
the
brave
blue
eyes
and
steady
lips
would
be
more
than
a
match
for
their
pompous
questioner
to
make
sure
of
her
powers
she
asked
the
captain
suddenly
in
english
shall
i
translate
for
you
he
stared
frowningly
at
her
understanding
not
a
word
nor
did
any
signs
of
intelligence
appear
on
the
others
faces
one
little
lieutenant
exclaimed
ach
english
as
though
making
a
discovery
but
could
get
no
further
and
the
captain
with
a
mutter
of
annoyance
said
sharply
speak
german
with
a
faint
excuse
for
her
forgetfulness
lucy
repeated
the
question
to
which
the
captain
nodded
agreement
adding
still
more
sharply
do
your
best
and
keep
your
wits
alert
the
more
he
tells
us
the
better
for
understand
as
lucy
nodded
in
silence
he
commenced
at
once
ask
him
his
the
question
being
translated
the
englishman
answered
archibald
beattie
captain
royal
ask
him
what
army
corps
he
belongs
after
a
second
s
hesitation
the
prisoner
answered
the
what
division
the
be
careful
said
the
german
sharply
tell
him
that
division
was
moved
toward
day
before
yesterday
and
he
was
taken
last
night
before
the
englishman
shrugged
his
shoulders
that
is
my
division
he
said
calmly
they
must
have
gone
down
to
without
the
german
gave
his
prisoner
an
glance
when
this
was
translated
what
regiment
he
persisted
the
this
time
lucy
repeated
the
number
with
something
like
a
cold
chill
down
her
back
the
fifth
regiment
of
the
second
division
had
passed
with
others
through
three
days
ago
on
its
way
south
she
knew
now
what
she
had
really
never
doubted
that
the
young
britisher
was
feeding
false
information
into
the
brain
of
his
questioner
and
trusting
to
the
germans
very
imperfect
knowledge
of
the
disposition
of
the
allied
troops
at
this
point
to
make
his
bluff
pass
muster
and
it
had
evidently
done
so
in
the
case
of
the
distant
division
he
had
joined
on
such
short
notice
the
captain
was
not
well
enough
informed
to
contradict
him
with
much
assurance
bob
had
been
right
lucy
thought
with
triumph
the
allied
airplanes
had
kept
the
enemy
from
observing
the
troops
movements
with
the
same
ascendancy
in
men
he
had
said
something
even
approaching
equality
in
numbers
not
a
foot
of
ground
would
have
been
captured
how
long
was
your
regiment
at
argenton
while
lucy
translated
the
englishman
s
answers
she
could
not
reflect
for
to
translate
the
english
into
german
was
all
she
could
manage
she
spoke
german
far
from
well
though
some
terms
much
alike
in
the
two
languages
such
as
corps
regiment
company
helped
her
a
little
but
when
she
put
the
english
questions
to
the
prisoner
and
in
the
pauses
while
the
german
captain
pondered
frowningly
over
his
next
words
she
thought
out
and
decided
on
her
scheme
her
chance
came
with
a
long
question
how
was
it
that
the
british
and
american
troops
south
of
argenton
retired
westward
after
their
artillery
as
lucy
translated
this
into
rapid
english
she
looked
hard
at
the
prisoner
and
without
pausing
added
the
words
are
they
sending
you
the
englishman
did
not
change
countenance
as
he
answered
the
artillery
had
to
move
cannon
are
valuable
we
stayed
where
we
were
posted
until
the
guns
were
safe
further
than
this
the
old
prison
outside
the
trembling
with
joy
at
her
success
lucy
translated
the
first
half
of
the
reply
the
german
received
it
with
a
sneering
smile
demanding
promptly
how
many
prisoners
do
you
claim
were
taken
by
your
regiment
to
this
inquiry
lucy
added
you
certain
the
englishman
answered
about
five
thousand
in
three
days
fighting
french
prisoners
told
me
so
what
are
you
doing
here
he
was
trying
her
own
game
anxious
she
could
see
to
account
for
her
presence
in
this
place
burning
with
eagerness
to
offer
a
few
words
of
hope
or
comfort
to
the
brave
young
officer
who
brought
bob
s
face
so
vividly
before
her
as
well
as
to
satisfy
his
own
curiosity
in
her
behalf
lucy
turned
expectantly
for
the
next
question
but
the
german
captain
with
the
gesture
of
a
man
who
feels
that
he
is
wasting
his
time
rose
noisily
from
his
seat
at
the
table
he
gave
a
keen
unfriendly
look
at
his
prisoner
as
though
he
would
like
to
have
compelled
his
confidence
but
perhaps
his
keenness
told
him
that
not
all
the
german
army
could
accomplish
that
the
four
juniors
had
sprung
to
their
feet
beside
him
and
he
waved
a
hand
toward
lucy
saying
shortly
that
will
do
lucy
turned
for
one
farewell
glance
at
her
ally
left
in
the
enemy
s
hands
his
face
lighted
up
for
a
second
also
as
though
her
sympathy
had
not
been
wasted
with
relief
too
she
guessed
that
she
was
quite
free
to
leave
then
she
was
in
the
sunny
street
again
and
patient
brêlet
greeting
her
with
a
look
of
thankful
joy
limped
forward
eagerly
saying
mademoiselle
i
don
t
know
what
i
thought
waiting
here
i
would
have
gone
for
help
but
where
is
help
when
the
boches
are
on
top
he
wiped
his
hot
face
shouldering
the
baskets
once
more
while
lucy
hurried
him
on
explaining
in
her
difficult
french
it
s
all
right
brêlet
they
only
wished
me
to
speak
she
breathed
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
looking
up
toward
the
blue
sky
and
the
soft
green
leaves
of
the
poplar
grove
before
them
i
ll
tell
you
about
it
brêlet
but
first
let
s
hurry
to
get
the
eggs
from
old
mère
breton
that
s
her
cottage
isn
t
it
beyond
the
trees
the
long
afternoon
was
almost
over
when
lucy
s
tired
feet
once
more
climbed
the
steps
of
the
hospital
her
arms
ached
with
the
weight
of
her
basket
of
eggs
and
vegetables
and
her
head
too
with
the
heat
of
the
sun
and
the
throb
of
anxious
thoughts
with
a
blank
depression
stealing
over
her
she
made
her
way
among
the
crowd
of
workers
and
found
herself
at
last
by
her
father
s
room
miss
pearse
was
just
coming
out
and
at
sight
of
lucy
her
face
wakened
to
a
glad
relief
as
she
exclaimed
oh
thank
heaven
you
re
back
i
couldn
t
think
what
had
happened
you
were
gone
so
long
were
you
all
right
yes
i
ll
tell
you
about
it
later
said
lucy
briefly
how
is
father
he
has
been
awake
all
the
afternoon
and
asking
for
you
he
doesn
t
know
yet
that
the
germans
have
the
town
in
another
day
it
won
t
hurt
him
to
hear
s
getting
well
so
fast
don
t
let
him
guess
it
though
lucy
he
thinks
you
are
going
back
to
england
he
has
fallen
asleep
just
now
but
go
in
and
sit
by
him
he
ll
wake
again
before
lucy
nodded
looking
at
the
young
nurse
s
tired
face
what
an
awful
day
you
ve
had
miss
pearse
oh
i
m
going
to
help
more
we
have
a
few
women
now
of
those
left
in
the
town
to
help
us
so
we
are
better
off
than
we
expected
was
the
still
cheerful
answer
and
you
have
helped
lucy
some
one
would
have
had
to
take
that
long
walk
if
you
hadn
t
been
lucy
smiled
faintly
not
convinced
that
she
had
done
much
and
went
softly
into
her
father
s
room
his
cot
was
sheltered
by
a
screen
since
morning
for
the
beds
of
two
other
officers
british
and
american
had
been
made
room
for
in
the
little
space
more
than
anything
in
the
world
lucy
longed
now
to
find
her
father
awake
and
filled
with
all
his
old
strength
of
purpose
she
wanted
to
tell
him
the
whole
dreadful
story
of
the
town
s
capture
and
to
ask
what
the
chances
really
were
that
the
allies
would
get
it
back
again
she
wanted
to
hear
him
share
her
grief
and
anger
and
lay
down
the
law
of
hope
and
courage
with
unshaken
resolution
she
needed
him
to
stand
by
her
in
spirit
that
she
might
lean
on
his
strength
of
mind
in
spite
of
his
weakness
of
body
but
she
could
not
have
her
wish
he
had
fallen
asleep
ignorant
of
her
desperate
need
overcome
at
last
with
the
weight
of
a
long
day
s
crushing
anxiety
the
lonely
little
girl
dropped
down
beside
the
cot
and
buried
her
hot
face
in
her
father
s
pillow
presently
she
heard
footsteps
approaching
but
indifferent
to
everything
she
did
not
move
then
some
one
knelt
down
on
the
floor
behind
her
and
two
arms
stole
gently
about
her
trembling
shoulders
for
a
moment
lucy
could
not
believe
she
really
heard
the
familiar
voice
that
filled
with
the
tenderest
affection
cried
softly
in
her
ear
miss
lucy
dear
miss
lucy
is
it
so
i
see
you
again
at
last
chapter
vi
a
german
ally
lucy
s
lips
could
hardly
frame
the
word
as
with
bewildered
gaze
she
stared
into
the
face
so
close
to
hers
there
were
the
same
bright
dark
eyes
filled
with
shrewd
kindliness
and
the
smiling
patient
mouth
lucy
seized
hold
of
the
hands
that
held
her
shoulders
to
make
sure
she
was
not
dreaming
and
the
touch
of
elizabeth
s
thin
fingers
made
her
presence
real
the
strangeness
of
their
meeting
was
for
that
moment
quite
forgotten
lucy
felt
nothing
but
an
overwhelming
relief
and
joy
as
her
kind
old
nurse
s
arms
once
more
went
around
her
she
was
no
longer
alone
with
her
sad
thoughts
in
the
gloomy
twilight
elizabeth
who
had
loved
her
and
shared
her
worries
for
ten
years
back
who
had
said
to
bob
with
tears
that
day
on
governor
s
island
was
here
to
help
and
comfort
her
lucy
forgot
karl
s
treachery
remembering
only
that
elizabeth
had
saved
bob
from
her
husband
s
hands
how
often
had
both
lucy
and
her
mother
longed
to
tell
her
of
their
gratitude
she
leaned
against
elizabeth
s
kind
shoulder
and
shed
a
few
tears
of
weariness
and
joy
giving
way
to
her
feelings
for
a
brief
comforting
moment
then
she
sat
up
and
wiped
her
eyes
footnote
see
captain
lucy
and
lieutenant
how
did
you
get
here
elizabeth
oh
if
things
go
on
happening
this
way

won
t
be
surprised
at
anything
many
days
have
i
been
here
miss
lucy
elizabeth
answered
as
she
too
wiped
away
tears
of
quiet
rejoicing
since
the
germans
hold
the
town
before
was
i
here
but
only
have
i
come
to
ask
if
i
may
help

the
and

lucy
stammered
over
the
question
he
is
with
his
regiment
not
far
lucy
thought
that
elizabeth
hesitated
before
she
added
i
could
not
follow
him
so
here
i
came
from
working
with
the
wounded
when
the
germans
take
the
first
time
already
i
saw
you
once
miss
lucy
the
day
of
the
you
watched
the
airplanes
in
the
in
a
flash
lucy
remembered
the
face
among
the
crowd
and
the
eyes
she
had
fancied
were
watching
her
that
was
it
i
saw
you
too
elizabeth
at
least
i
felt
sure
that
some
one
was
looking
at
me
why
didn
t
you
let
me
see
you
i
thought
better
not
miss
lucy
the
germans
must
keep
very
quiet
while
the
french
and
americans
were
elizabeth
s
voice
shook
a
little
as
she
spoke
and
in
spite
of
herself
lucy
felt
an
unreasoning
pity
for
her
as
the
little
german
woman
went
on
i
thought
maybe
you
learn
from
bob
that
i
was
here
you
have
not
seen
him
no
i
saw
him
once
about
a
month
the
words
were
on
lucy
s
lips
to
tell
elizabeth
of
bob
s
visit
to
the
day
before
the
town
s
capture
but
before
they
were
spoken
she
checked
herself
the
trust
and
affection
of
nearly
ten
years
companionship
were
not
ties
lightly
cast
aside
but
now
her
first
childish
delight
at
elizabeth
s
presence
over
a
barrier
rose
between
and
impassable
elizabeth
was
a
german
and
the
wife
of
a
german
soldier
summoning
the
prudence
she
had
so
nearly
forgotten
lucy
kept
silent
and
pressed
her
lips
close
together
the
vision
of
the
german
officer
questioning
the
young
englishman
came
before
her
eyes
what
might
her
unconsidered
words
mean
to
bob
elizabeth
s
expressive
face
looked
both
hurt
and
downcast
at
lucy
s
sudden
silence
of
which
the
meaning
was
plain
enough
but
she
made
no
complaint
and
pointing
toward
colonel
gordon
s
cot
beside
which
they
sat
on
the
floor
said
softly
your
father
wakes
now
miss
lucy
already
have
i
talked
with
him
did
you
stay
with
him
this
afternoon
elizabeth
asked
lucy
reaching
out
to
clasp
her
old
nurse
s
hand
in
sudden
remorse
at
her
own
suspicion
for
had
not
elizabeth
saved
bob
s
life
yes
elizabeth
nodded
i
stay
with
him
a
little
she
rose
to
her
feet
looking
toward
the
cot
where
the
wounded
officer
had
begun
to
stir
in
waking
i
leave
you
with
him
now
she
said
and
with
a
lingering
glance
at
lucy
from
her
brown
eyes
went
quietly
out
of
the
room
lucy
turned
eagerly
to
her
father
hardly
waiting
for
him
to
open
his
eyes
before
she
exclaimed
oh
father
i
ve
seen
elizabeth
and
she
said
she
had
talked
to
you
isn
t
it
wonderful
to
find
her
here
colonel
gordon
smiled
settling
his
big
lean
shoulders
among
the
pillows
as
he
gave
an
understanding
nod
to
his
daughter
s
quick
words
but
lucy
had
paused
suddenly
in
her
outburst
of
joy
over
elizabeth
s
presence
she
remembered
miss
pearse
s
warning
and
with
a
pang
of
fear
lest
some
unconsidered
word
escape
her
realized
that
her
father
was
still
ignorant
of
the
town
s
capture
unless
her
father
s
first
words
put
her
mind
at
rest
on
that
score
i
saw
her
for
only
a
minute
after
i
woke
up
he
said
turning
on
his
side
with
a
slight
painful
effort
to
look
into
lucy
s
face
but
that
was
long
enough
to
thank
her
for
what
she
did
last
year
she
told
me
that
she
had
been
allowed
to
help
in
the
hospital
and
that
she
hoped
to
see
you
how
she
got
here
i
can
t
imagine
nor
why
they
trust
her
to
work
among
the
we
both
know
there
couldn
t
be
found
a
better
lucy
was
silent
afraid
to
answer
since
she
could
not
tell
the
elizabeth
was
trusted
because
the
hospital
was
in
the
hands
of
her
compatriots
colonel
gordon
did
not
notice
her
confusion
as
he
continued
earnestly
i
m
very
glad
she
s
she
your
sake
lucy
she
is
devoted
to
you
beyond
all
doubt
and
i
won
t
be
quite
so
uneasy
with
her
here
to
look
after
you
greyson
seems
almighty
slow
about
getting
you
off
to
calais
i
suppose
he
can
t
help
it
i
can
imagine
what
the
state
of
transportation
is
but
surely
you
won
t
have
to
stay
much
longer
of
course
if
it
were
possible
to
get
right
on
your
mother
and
henry
would
have
been
here
long
he
paused
breathing
a
little
hard
and
frowning
unreconciled
as
he
silently
considered
the
obstacles
to
lucy
s
departure
lucy
sat
wretchedly
silent
knowing
the
truth
to
be
a
hundred
times
worse
than
what
already
greatly
troubled
him
in
a
moment
he
found
breath
to
speak
again
lucy
he
said
thoughtfully
i
said
i
knew
elizabeth
was
devoted
to
you
and
so
she
is
but
don
t
forget
for
a
moment
however
kindly
we
feel
toward
her
that
her
country
is
our
enemy
we
have
good
proof
that
she
would
not
harm
bob
even
at
karl
s
command
but
that
is
a
personal
affection
with
her
it
does
not
mean
she
would
not
harm
the
allies
cause
you
must
be
on
the
watch
lest
you
speak
a
word
that
might
be
repeated
to
the
enemy
s
lucy
murmured
her
agreement
as
her
father
his
emphatic
tone
changing
to
one
of
wonder
said
again
why
they
allow
her
to
work
here
i
can
t
imagine
i
must
ask
you
re
tired
father
said
lucy
getting
up
after
a
moment
from
the
floor
beside
the
cot
as
colonel
gordon
lay
wearily
back
after
his
prolonged
talk
her
voice
shook
a
little
with
threatening
tears
for
it
seemed
dreadful
to
her
that
he
should
not
know
the
truth
and
that
she
should
help
to
deceive
him
though
common
sense
told
her
it
was
wise
and
necessary
he
would
certainly
sleep
more
peacefully
that
night
thinking
the
allies
in
possession
of
the
town
but
it
was
a
deception
which
could
not
be
kept
up
much
longer
she
bade
him
with
a
brave
attempt
at
cheerfulness
and
went
out
into
the
big
ward
which
was
just
dimmed
by
approaching
twilight
elizabeth
was
carrying
a
heavy
basket
of
red
cross
supplies
across
the
hall
to
the
storeroom
and
lucy
without
asking
permission
ran
up
to
her
and
seized
one
of
the
straw
handles
taking
half
the
weight
on
her
own
arm
go
on
i
m
going
to
help
she
said
briefly
elizabeth
obeyed
glancing
back
with
troubled
solicitude
at
the
serious
determined
face
of
the
little
girl
she
knew
so
well
while
lucy
with
that
familiar
figure
before
her
bringing
swift
memories
of
happy
days
at
home
looked
down
the
rows
of
wounded
men
and
wondered
again
if
this
could
all
be
real
that
night
in
spite
of
the
welcome
silence
of
the
guns
lucy
s
natural
fear
and
dread
at
the
strange
fate
that
had
befallen
her
brought
wakefulness
and
feverish
dreams
but
she
was
too
worn
out
to
lie
awake
long
and
miss
pearse
s
footsteps
moving
about
in
the
gray
dawn
roused
her
from
deep
sleep
she
struggled
at
that
moment
with
desperate
drowsiness
intensified
by
the
longing
to
fall
back
where
the
bitter
truth
could
be
forgotten
but
she
fought
hard
against
her
weakness
and
fearful
of
yielding
sprang
out
of
bed
and
plunged
her
face
into
cold
water
her
sleepy
eyes
blinked
stupidly
back
at
her
from
the
shadowy
mirror
as
she
vigorously
rubbed
away
the
drops
but
her
resolution
was
triumphant
she
meant
to
work
that
by
nightfall
she
might
feel
the
satisfaction
of
having
done
what
she
could
to
only
thing
that
was
worth
doing
here
the
guns
had
commenced
again
with
intermittent
bursts
of
firing
but
they
were
not
so
close
now
and
the
vibration
of
the
air
not
so
terrific
the
allied
guns
were
turned
toward
since
the
capture
and
the
german
batteries
had
found
new
emplacement
outside
the
town
s
western
edge
the
edge
nearest
to
the
railways
and
the
channel
lucy
looked
from
the
window
toward
the
eastern
sky
where
the
clouds
were
gleaming
with
a
soft
pearly
light
there
were
no
bursting
shells
to
mar
the
sunrise
all
was
quiet
on
this
side
now
she
glanced
down
at
the
street
along
which
a
dozen
german
soldiers
were
strolling
a
few
shouted
words
reached
her
ears
and
once
more
she
wished
with
all
her
heart
she
did
not
understand
that
language
of
which
every
word
had
grown
hateful
then
suddenly
she
remembered
captain
beattie
and
the
possibility
of
help
to
him
which
that
knowledge
had
put
into
her
hands
it
would
give
her
glorious
satisfaction
to
bring
the
enemy
s
own
tongue
to
use
against
them
she
had
first
though
to
learn
the
whereabouts
of
the
old
prison
to
which
he
had
been
taken
she
quickly
finished
dressing
and
joined
the
two
nurses
who
saw
her
with
surprise
and
a
little
protest
on
miss
pearse
s
part
against
her
early
rising
she
did
not
scold
much
though
and
seemed
glad
of
the
promise
of
lucy
s
help
i
ll
give
you
work
to
do
the
minute
you
are
ready
for
it
she
said
in
answer
to
lucy
s
eager
demand
as
they
crossed
the
street
and
climbed
the
hospital
steps
under
the
inspection
of
the
sentry
go
in
and
speak
to
your
father
first
and
then
we
ll
lucy
entered
the
little
room
softly
mindful
of
the
other
wounded
officers
as
well
as
of
her
father
and
found
colonel
gordon
awake
with
eyes
turned
toward
the
door
he
looked
rested
and
stronger
with
the
improvement
each
day
now
brought
but
his
lips
were
firmly
set
as
lucy
had
often
seen
them
when
he
was
thinking
out
a
hard
piece
of
work
and
his
smile
was
but
a
faint
one
as
he
greeted
her
did
you
sleep
well
father
are
you
all
right
she
asked
stammering
a
little
because
she
hated
to
remember
the
unhappy
secret
between
them
colonel
gordon
s
keen
eyes
studied
her
flushed
and
anxious
face
as
he
answered
quietly
yes
i
m
all
right
little
girl
you
may
drop
the
camouflage
now
i
know
we
ve
lost
the
oh
father
who
told
you
i
didn
t
cried
lucy
dropping
down
beside
him
a
great
rush
of
relief
overpowering
all
her
fears
he
knew
the
worst
and
they
could
share
it
together
and
he
had
borne
the
news
with
his
old
unshakable
courage
lucy
thought
of
what
bob
had
said
more
than
four
years
ago
at
fort
douglas
when
the
mexican
rebels
rose
over
night
threatening
the
border
father
may
get
excited
if
breakfast
is
late
but
when
anything
is
really
wrong
he
s
all
greyson
told
me
said
colonel
gordon
i
suppose
he
thought
i
should
guess
it
anyhow
when
i
began
asking
him
about
elizabeth
funny
letting
me
he
spoke
with
a
faint
scorn
for
the
ways
of
the
medical
corps
forgetting
as
a
man
on
the
road
to
recovery
is
apt
to
do
how
ill
he
had
been
only
a
few
days
before
i
wondered
what
in
thunder
was
the
matter
that
they
couldn
t
get
you
off
he
went
on
poor
little
s
pretty
tough
his
face
was
drawn
with
anxiety
as
he
reached
out
a
hand
and
caught
hers
in
a
strong
clasp
but
she
broke
in
eagerly
i
m
all
right
father
please
don
t
feel
so
worried
i
m
working
in
the
hospital
and
honestly
you
don
t
know
how
glad
and
proud
i
the
scary
part
is
getting
i
can
be
of
use
it
can
t
be
helped
was
her
father
s
slow
and
almost
unheeding
answer
greyson
tells
me
the
enemy
has
left
the
hospital
pretty
much
in
our
own
hands
they
are
rather
too
tired
to
bother
us
he
said
a
flash
of
satisfaction
lighting
his
face
i
know
that
much
from
the
action
in
which
i
was
hit
their
advance
is
made
with
a
desperately
driven
force
that
leaves
them
limp
and
done
for
when
it
is
over
a
couple
of
million
americans
will
turn
the
great
tide
long
before
that
time
our
should
free
the
meanwhile
you
poor
little
girl
you
re
in
the
german
i
m
quite
used
to
it
now
lucy
insisted
not
realizing
the
absurdity
of
her
words
in
her
longing
to
reassure
her
father
s
keenly
suffering
mind
and
elizabeth
is
here
you
will
take
care
of
thankful
i
am
for
that
said
colonel
gordon
quickly
here
comes
major
greyson
so
i
ll
leave
you
said
lucy
rising
from
her
place
as
the
surgeon
entered
for
his
morning
visit
i
ll
go
and
get
my
in
the
little
she
found
elizabeth
setting
the
table
with
plates
and
spoons
the
sight
was
such
a
reminder
of
on
governor
s
island
that
forgetting
all
her
repugnance
to
elizabeth
s
german
sympathies
she
threw
her
arms
around
her
old
nurse
s
thin
little
shoulders
and
gave
her
a
hug
for
a
morning
greeting
elizabeth
turned
a
delighted
face
toward
her
exclaiming
dear
miss
lucy
how
early
you
are
up
come
in
this
chair
sit
and
i
will
get
you
the
best
i
it
seemed
very
pleasant
to
sit
down
and
be
waited
on
by
elizabeth
s
deft
fingers
but
the
strangeness
of
her
being
there
had
not
yet
passed
from
lucy
s
mind
and
she
said
wistfully
oh
elizabeth
if
we
were
only
back
at
home
father
and
mother
and
bob
and
william
and
you
and
wouldn
t
it
be
great
that
will
come
again
miss
lucy
suggested
elizabeth
hopefully
but
lucy
unable
to
say
frankly
not
while
there
are
enough
germans
left
alive
to
fight
lifted
a
spoonful
of
weak
cocoa
to
her
lips
in
silence
and
he
is
asked
elizabeth
stopping
her
work
to
make
the
inquiry
with
eager
affection
in
her
eyes
he
is
well
and
thank
goodness
safe
at
home
sighed
lucy
seeing
again
before
her
the
forlorn
stumbling
little
children
of
the
refugees
from
miss
pearse
came
in
presently
and
joined
her
famished
after
an
hour
s
hard
work
i
have
a
job
all
ready
for
you
lucy
she
said
when
she
had
taken
a
sip
of
hot
coffee
and
eaten
a
piece
of
black
bread
it
is
a
tiresome
one
but
very
i
ll
do
anything
said
lucy
quickly
our
hospital
garments
are
falling
into
rags
and
no
one
has
any
time
to
mend
them
elizabeth
has
been
helping
but
i
am
going
to
send
her
for
mère
breton
s
supplies
this
morning
while
you
stay
here
and
sew
in
her
miss
pearse
had
heard
all
about
lucy
s
adventure
of
the
day
before
and
did
not
wish
her
sent
on
the
same
errand
again
until
the
germans
should
have
their
own
interpreters
or
officers
who
spoke
the
barbarous
english
tongue
in
any
case
elizabeth
could
serve
their
purpose
lucy
had
also
told
miss
pearse
of
the
years
the
german
woman
had
spent
with
the
gordon
family
and
of
the
service
she
had
rendered
them
miss
pearse
had
shown
both
interest
and
sympathy
wondering
much
like
lucy
at
the
strange
chance
of
war
which
had
brought
these
two
old
friends
together
on
such
hard
terms
for
friendship
like
colonel
gordon
she
warned
lucy
repeatedly
against
speaking
unguardedly
before
her
old
nurse
she
is
the
most
german
person
i
ever
saw
she
said
with
conviction
she
has
all
their
good
qualities
so
i
shouldn
t
be
surprised
if
she
had
some
of
their
bad
ones
anyway
you
may
be
sure
her
husband
could
make
her
try
to
worm
out
information
about
the
troops
you
don
t
know
what
trifling
little
facts
they
can
make
use
of
don
t
answer
any
questions
about
what
troops
were
in
the
town
or
anything
like
she
hasn
t
asked
me
any
said
lucy
she
has
been
here
herself
since
the
last
german
occupation
anyhow
but
i
ll
be
she
was
thinking
over
these
warnings
as
she
sat
half
an
hour
later
by
the
narrow
windows
of
the
nurses
room
mending
long
rips
and
tears
in
and
pajamas
outside
the
window
the
german
sentry
paced
the
little
garden
by
the
budding
and
crumbling
walls
and
within
the
hospital
the
workers
continued
their
task
while
she
meditated
elizabeth
came
out
from
the
side
door
into
the
garden
carrying
two
baskets
on
her
arms
and
with
a
nod
to
the
sentry
passed
quickly
out
through
the
ruined
gate
she
could
have
obtained
brêlet
s
company
and
assistance
but
she
had
started
off
alone
with
her
big
baskets
lucy
as
she
looked
after
her
thought
she
guessed
why
the
little
german
woman
suspected
that
the
poilu
would
have
gone
with
her
most
unwillingly
outside
the
gate
elizabeth
turned
east
through
the
same
deserted
streets
which
led
toward
the
cottages
in
the
lanes
and
to
the
meadows
beyond
the
town
she
walked
quickly
for
the
supplies
were
urgently
needed
besides
she
had
worked
so
hard
all
her
life
that
active
occupation
had
become
second
nature
to
her
bob
had
once
said
elizabeth
never
sits
down
to
to
work
more
easily
that
she
found
a
path
among
the
broken
stone
with
patient
care
for
her
shoes
were
old
and
gave
little
protection
to
her
feet
once
she
stopped
to
exchange
a
word
with
a
german
sentry
during
a
lull
in
the
firing
when
she
neared
the
edge
of
the
town
she
was
challenged
by
the
guard
in
front
of
the
headquarters
building
but
her
german
tongue
and
written
permission
won
her
ready
passage
at
the
border
of
the
meadow
stood
a
little
improvised
shack
put
up
to
accommodate
a
guard
and
a
field
telephone
in
case
of
any
alarm
from
this
side
of
the
town
in
front
of
it
a
corporal
was
idly
walking
about
stopping
to
stare
at
elizabeth
as
she
hurried
by
she
called
out
a
to
him
which
he
answered
with
the
inquiry
where
are
you
going
to
fill
those
big
baskets
elizabeth
nodded
over
toward
mère
breton
s
cottage
hidden
behind
its
little
grove
of
apple
and
plum
trees
of
which
many
were
reduced
to
blackened
and
leafless
trunks
the
cottage
itself
had
been
twice
struck
but
the
sturdy
old
frenchwoman
refused
to
abandon
it
and
in
the
deadly
rain
and
thunder
of
bursting
shells
had
gone
on
cultivating
her
garden
and
coaxing
her
frightened
hens
to
eat
and
fatten
for
the
wounded
poilus
in
the
hospitals
now
she
feared
they
would
nearly
all
go
down
german
throats
but
lucy
had
the
day
before
tried
her
best
in
her
halting
french
to
convince
mère
breton
that
only
by
feeding
the
boches
could
their
own
people
expect
a
share
elizabeth
looked
up
at
the
blue
sky
away
from
the
shattered
trees
of
the
wood
in
front
as
she
crossed
the
meadow
her
eyes
always
anxious
and
watchful
these
days
felt
a
relief
in
turning
from
the
scarred
earth
to
the
untroubled
heavens
but
this
war
is
not
only
on
the
earth
as
she
realized
with
a
swift
start
when
out
from
behind
the
clouds
darted
two
flying
specks
which
hung
poised
above
the
meadow
the
sun
just
touching
their
tiny
wings
she
hurried
on
reached
mère
breton
s
house
and
found
the
old
woman
in
the
garden
among
her
cabbages
elizabeth
did
not
know
a
word
of
french
but
she
held
out
the
hospital
baskets
with
a
pleasant
nod
and
smile
to
cover
the
deficiency
of
language
mère
breton
s
sharp
blue
eyes
from
beneath
her
white
cap
gave
the
german
woman
a
look
of
bitter
hostility
quite
untouched
by
the
smile
which
faded
from
elizabeth
s
lips
unanswered
mère
breton
took
the
baskets
trudged
off
to
fill
them
and
presently
returned
them
in
silence
her
thoughts
were
as
plain
as
though
she
had
spoken
she
knew
that
not
an
egg
nor
a
fowl
would
go
to
her
poilus
with
a
boche
for
messenger
elizabeth
nodded
without
attempting
any
further
friendly
advances
and
started
on
her
hot
walk
back
this
time
weighed
down
with
a
heavy
load
she
looked
quickly
up
at
the
sky
again
as
she
came
out
from
beneath
the
trees
for
the
noise
of
an
airplane
was
now
distinctly
heard
as
it
circled
not
more
than
half
a
mile
above
her
head
as
she
stared
up
squinting
in
the
sunlight
the
machine
dived
suddenly
and
flew
around
the
meadow
hardly
two
hundred
yards
above
the
earth
elizabeth
stood
paralyzed
between
an
impulse
to
drop
down
upon
the
grass
and
another
to
run
for
shelter
at
the
observation
post
behind
her
the
corporal
had
rushed
inside
to
the
telephone
no
batteries
were
stationed
at
this
point
for
the
germans
counted
on
the
allies
not
caring
to
drop
bombs
on
but
a
telephone
call
could
bring
guns
to
bear
on
intruding
planes
from
the
north
of
the
town
while
elizabeth
stood
frozen
to
the
spot
the
airplane
above
her
as
though
scorning
to
recognize
the
fact
that
was
in
german
hands
flew
over
her
so
close
that
she
could
see
the
glistening
paint
of
the
american
emblems
on
its
wings
and
tail
and
the
pilot
sitting
alone
in
his
little
monoplane
leaned
over
the
side
and
looked
at
her
elizabeth
let
fall
her
baskets
heedless
she
who
was
always
so
careful
of
the
fragile
provisions
within
the
face
looking
down
with
eager
eyes
from
a
hundred
feet
above
her
was
bob
gordon
s
he
reached
toward
his
feet
and
through
the
roaring
of
the
propeller
elizabeth
heard
a
wild
shout
of
warning
directed
to
her
from
the
observation
post
behind
but
no
bomb
was
flung
from
the
plane
which
had
her
at
its
mercy
instead
she
was
suddenly
enveloped
in
a
shower
of
papers
fluttering
down
toward
the
grass
from
the
pilot
s
hand
as
she
brushed
them
dazedly
from
her
shoulders
bob
leaned
out
once
more
and
threw
a
last
paper
only
this
one
was
crushed
into
a
ball
with
a
hasty
pressure
of
his
fingers
then
the
guns
crashed
out
and
the
nieuport
rose
like
a
bird
and
winged
its
way
toward
the
sun
dropping
another
shower
of
papers
as
it
mounted
which
scattered
over
the
green
surface
of
the
field
the
balls
whistled
through
the
air
but
before
any
accurate
shot
was
possible
the
daring
little
scout
had
disappeared
behind
a
drifting
cloud
beyond
the
reach
of
fire
elizabeth
had
picked
up
the
ball
of
paper
as
soon
as
it
touched
the
grass
with
trembling
hands
while
she
watched
the
nieuport
make
its
swift
escape
she
smoothed
out
the
wrinkled
sheet
and
held
it
against
the
sunlight
what
s
that
you
have
there
asked
an
angry
voice
behind
her
and
the
corporal
and
panting
looked
over
her
shoulder
then
stooped
to
pick
up
another
of
the
leaflets
some
more
of
president
wilson
s
talk
said
elizabeth
still
looking
with
a
critical
air
at
the
printed
sheet
before
her
but
she
added
turning
to
the
corporal
with
an
anxious
shake
of
the
head
for
a
moment
i
thought
i
was
done
for
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
it
was
no
time
to
stand
staring
like
a
dummy
was
the
corporal
s
comment
come
help
me
gather
up
this
trash
and
i
ll
burn
it
and
give
the
impertinent
yankee
that
for
his
elizabeth
nodded
leaning
down
to
pick
up
the
papers
thickly
scattered
over
the
grass
her
heart
was
beating
so
hard
she
could
hardly
conceal
her
hurried
breathing
in
spite
of
her
calm
and
docile
exterior
as
she
obeyed
the
corporal
s
orders
she
gathered
up
the
crumpled
sheet
together
with
the
others
crumpling
them
all
into
a
wad
before
handing
them
to
her
companion
she
had
seen
all
she
wanted
in
those
two
or
three
minutes
while
she
held
the
paper
against
the
sunlight
the
printed
leaves
were
copies
in
english
and
german
of
a
part
of
president
wilson
s
speech
made
in
new
york
on
the
of
may
but
the
paragraph
that
elizabeth
read
had
been
pricked
with
pinholes
before
it
was
dropped
at
her
feet
it
was
as
follows
there
are
two
with
which
we
are
face
to
face
the
duty
is
to
win
and
the
second
duty
that
goes
hand
in
hand
with
it
is
to
win
it
and
showing
of
our
power
but
the
quality
of
our
purpose
of
ourselves
of
course
the
first
the
duty
that
we
must
keep
in
the
of
our
thought
it
is
accomplished
is
to
win
the
war
i
have
heard
recently
say
we
must
get
five
million
men
ready
why
limit
it
to
five
million
footnote
tn
the
letters
that
were
marked
with
pinholes
are
marked
here
in
against
the
glowing
sunlight
elizabeth
read
bob
s
message
i
shall
try
to
land
back
in
the
hospital
lucy
worked
hard
at
the
big
pile
of
garments
with
their
long
ragged
tears
her
neck
ached
and
her
fingers
after
two
hours
but
she
kept
steadily
at
it
with
the
satisfying
sense
of
being
one
of
the
hospital
workers
of
doing
right
where
the
product
of
her
hands
was
so
urgently
needed
what
she
had
often
done
from
far
away
when
the
morning
was
half
over
elizabeth
came
back
through
the
garden
walking
slowly
with
her
loaded
baskets
and
presently
she
came
into
the
room
where
lucy
was
hello
elizabeth
exclaimed
lucy
tired
of
her
own
thoughts
and
welcoming
her
old
nurse
with
a
smile
are
you
coming
to
sew
with
me
i
d
love
some
one
to
talk
yes
for
a
few
minutes
i
help
you
said
elizabeth
in
a
quick
earnest
voice
that
made
lucy
look
up
at
her
curiously
as
she
continued
because
i
something
have
to
tell
you
that
no
one
must
hear
so
i
sit
by
you
and
softly
always
when
elizabeth
was
excited
her
english
grew
worse
and
now
lucy
astonished
at
her
words
and
manner
stopped
sewing
and
asked
hurriedly
what
is
it
elizabeth
oh
tell
me
s
nobody
to
not
convinced
of
this
elizabeth
gave
a
sharp
glance
outside
the
open
door
and
taking
a
torn
garment
on
her
lap
drew
her
chair
close
to
lucy
s
by
the
window
before
she
answered
i
have
bob
seen
and
he
gave
me
a
bob
gasped
lucy
her
terrified
eyes
devouring
elizabeth
s
face
oh
what
is
he
doing
here
he
is
not
here
now
said
elizabeth
quickly
he
has
got
safe
with
her
needle
poised
between
her
fingers
while
she
forgot
all
pretense
of
sewing
she
told
lucy
in
a
voice
just
above
a
whisper
of
her
morning
s
adventure
lucy
heard
her
in
stupefied
silence
only
her
glowing
cheeks
and
shining
eyes
giving
sign
of
her
overpowering
excitement
other
feelings
too
beside
joy
at
this
news
of
her
brother
showed
in
her
face
a
puzzled
wonder
was
strongest
with
the
realization
of
her
old
nurse
s
german
sympathies
when
elizabeth
came
to
the
part
of
her
story
where
bob
contrived
to
drop
his
message
and
she
to
decipher
it
lucy
could
contain
herself
no
longer
but
how
did
you
there
was
a
message
hidden
there
how
could
bob
know
you
would
find
it
she
burst
out
speaking
but
a
part
of
her
confused
thoughts
aloud
for
answer
elizabeth
first
looked
earnestly
into
her
face
as
though
she
read
clearly
what
lucy
would
not
she
wondered
greatly
at
bob
s
trust
in
putting
down
her
needle
clasped
her
thin
hands
anxiously
together
miss
lucy
she
said
a
little
shakily
i
hope
you
believe
me
because
i
nothing
tell
you
but
the
truth
did
i
not
tell
you
i
saw
bob
here
a
month
ago
when
the
allies
take
the
town
at
that
time
we
talk
and
bob
explain
to
me
a
way
that
he
could
a
message
send
if
he
needs
he
have
the
charge
to
let
fall
those
speeches
of
the
president
over
the
german
lines
he
show
me
how
with
a
pin
he
could
a
message
make
that
no
one
would
see
if
they
had
no
thought
for
it
when
he
said
this
he
spoke
of
war
news
course
he
not
think
then
that
you
be
left
here
if
the
germans
take
the
but
elizabeth
lucy
stammered
more
at
sea
than
ever
he
arranged
a
cipher
with
he
spoke
to
you
of
war
news
yes
elizabeth
nodded
i
know
what
you
would
say
miss
lucy
you
wonder
that
he
tell
me
but
it
was
first
me
who
tell
him
elizabeth
s
dark
eyes
were
filled
with
pain
and
sorrow
as
she
looked
into
lucy
s
face
and
whispered
no
longer
do
i
wish
for
germany
to
never
in
ten
long
years
had
lucy
doubted
elizabeth
s
word
but
now
a
wretched
fear
shot
through
her
did
she
dare
trust
blindly
to
karl
s
wife
but
even
while
she
hesitated
the
kind
steady
honest
gaze
of
those
dark
eyes
swept
her
last
doubts
away
with
impetuous
remorse
and
thanksgiving
she
reached
out
her
hands
and
clasped
elizabeth
s
closely
while
her
tongue
struggled
for
words
to
express
her
joy
and
confidence
oh
elizabeth
i
m
glad
i
m
so
glad
was
all
she
said
but
her
face
spoke
for
her
and
elizabeth
s
anxious
eyes
shone
with
relief
and
friendliness
you
believe
me
dear
miss
know
i
speak
truth
she
asked
eagerly
then
at
lucy
s
swift
assent
she
continued
earnestly
i
tell
you
the
truth
and
then
you
see
i
do
not
deceive
you
miss
lucy
i
do
not
love
france
or
england
or
even
america
better
than
my
fatherland
germany
i
love
and
always
will
i
love
her
only
miss
lucy
now
is
no
longer
with
us
the
dear
country
i
before
a
look
of
horror
flashed
into
her
kind
face
as
she
said
heavily
i
have
things
seen
that
never
could
i
tell
you
of
at
first
i
believe
my
countrymen
who
say
the
english
prisoners
are
guilty
of
i
never
any
englishmen
knew
i
think
perhaps
they
deserve
the
deadly
punishment
but
when
america
send
her
soldiers
against
elizabeth
s
voice
trembled
when
bob
so
nearly
was
given
up
to
death
when
they
tell
me
lies
of
how
the
americans
they
are
worse
than
believe
them
not
too
long
was
i
in
america
to
be
so
fooled
and
now
i
know
it
is
a
cruel
war
that
has
brought
her
against
us
for
those
men
who
have
put
the
world
on
fire
who
have
made
to
die
those
many
innocent
miss
lucy
better
they
are
beat
and
conquered
by
america
and
so
may
god
let
the
old
germany
live
again
the
little
german
woman
s
low
cautious
voice
shook
with
earnestness
her
clasped
hands
opened
and
closed
in
quick
restless
gestures
so
unlike
quiet
steady
elizabeth
that
lucy
s
heart
beat
with
pity
and
understanding
in
elizabeth
s
simple
nature
love
of
country
was
very
strong
and
her
disillusionment
at
returning
to
germany
very
bitter
yet
she
still
found
courage
to
hope
for
better
things
lucy
marveled
at
her
patient
faith
but
she
could
not
at
all
put
her
thoughts
into
words
nor
indeed
find
thoughts
that
would
not
hurt
more
than
console
so
after
a
look
of
warm
affection
she
sat
silent
but
in
a
moment
curiosity
prompted
her
to
ask
how
about
karl
elizabeth
does
he
know
how
you
feel
a
shadow
settled
once
more
on
elizabeth
s
face
but
she
answered
quietly
karl
is
very
angry
with
me
miss
lucy
but
it
is
not
that
he
knows
i
would
help
the
allies
then
why
is
he
angry
but
even
as
lucy
asked
the
question
she
knew
the
answer
is
it
because
of
bob
she
faltered
and
seeing
she
had
guessed
elizabeth
nodded
somehow
karl
find
out
that
it
is
my
fault
bob
was
not
taken
as
a
spy
not
yet
will
he
forgive
it
but
i
not
think
he
feel
so
always
and
still
if
he
need
me
i
go
to
where
is
he
now
asked
lucy
thinking
how
little
karl
deserved
such
faithfulness
and
ashamed
that
she
had
ever
wondered
at
bob
s
trusting
elizabeth
so
entirely
he
is
in
in
a
hospital
he
is
safe
miss
lucy
i
not
think
i
could
work
to
help
america
to
win
if
karl
was
in
the
lucy
had
no
sympathy
for
this
feeling
but
she
dimly
understood
it
another
desire
had
grown
stronger
than
all
else
in
her
mind
now
the
wish
to
make
sure
of
reaching
bob
s
rendezvous
the
great
meadows
behind
the
town
were
his
only
possible
but
they
were
more
than
a
mile
away
and
sentries
were
on
guard
all
night
in
the
town
oh
elizabeth
how
shall
we
ever
manage
to
get
there
she
questioned
in
a
torment
of
anxiety
elizabeth
gave
her
a
funny
little
and
yet
resolute
you
have
forgot
miss
lucy
that
i
am
a
german
almost
where
i
like
can
i
go
since
the
town
is
chapter
vii
bob
gordon
and
captain
beattie
nightfall
of
the
same
day
lucy
left
the
hospital
and
crossed
the
street
to
return
to
her
bedroom
miss
pearse
had
urged
her
to
go
early
to
bed
though
the
truth
was
she
did
not
feel
so
tired
after
a
long
afternoon
spent
in
helping
unpack
supplies
as
she
had
done
on
the
days
when
she
sat
unoccupied
waiting
for
she
knew
not
what
she
picked
her
way
among
the
broken
slowly
burdened
with
many
thoughts
she
had
not
told
miss
pearse
a
word
about
bob
s
coming
nor
of
her
own
and
elizabeth
s
intention
it
was
not
that
she
was
unwilling
to
confide
in
her
kind
friend
but
that
she
dreaded
to
face
miss
pearse
s
doubts
and
fears
weighed
down
as
she
was
with
plenty
of
her
own
it
seemed
much
easier
to
go
as
elizabeth
had
planned
without
causing
anxiety
or
alarm
to
any
one
for
however
difficult
the
way
and
severe
the
trial
to
her
courage
lucy
knew
that
the
chance
of
seeing
bob
and
of
hearing
news
of
himself
and
of
their
mother
was
enough
to
overcome
all
her
fears
she
lay
down
dressed
as
she
was
on
her
bed
and
promptly
fell
asleep
for
she
had
been
up
since
five
o
clock
that
morning
she
set
miss
pearse
s
alarm
clock
before
lying
down
and
put
it
beside
her
pillow
in
case
she
should
sleep
too
long
but
after
an
hour
a
prolonged
burst
of
firing
roused
her
she
sat
up
and
looked
at
the
clock
but
it
was
too
dark
to
see
anything
she
found
some
matches
and
striking
a
light
discovered
that
it
was
nine
o
clock
just
time
for
the
alarm
miss
pearse
did
not
come
off
duty
till
eleven
with
fast
beating
heart
lucy
threw
around
her
shoulders
a
little
cape
which
she
often
wore
on
summer
evenings
for
the
night
had
grown
damp
and
chilly
breathing
a
fervent
prayer
for
the
success
of
her
expedition
and
for
her
brother
s
safety
she
left
the
room
and
closing
her
door
that
miss
pearse
might
think
her
asleep
when
she
came
in
stole
softly
to
the
stairs
and
down
into
the
street
it
was
a
starlit
night
and
the
figure
of
the
sentry
patrolling
the
square
in
front
of
the
hospital
showed
clearly
his
bayonet
touched
with
a
faint
gleam
as
he
shifted
his
gun
on
his
shoulder
the
handful
of
french
townspeople
were
all
indoors
none
of
them
being
allowed
by
the
germans
on
the
streets
after
eight
o
clock
unless
on
hospital
duty
but
an
occasional
soldier
passed
by
with
clumping
boots
or
clinking
spurs
while
lucy
stood
hidden
in
the
doorway
the
lights
of
the
hospital
windows
twinkled
now
and
then
as
a
hurrying
figure
passed
in
front
of
them
a
bat
whizzed
close
by
lucy
s
ear
she
felt
so
lonely
at
that
moment
that
she
welcomed
the
sound
of
its
blundering
wings
it
was
a
nice
french
bat
she
thought
bent
on
some
peaceful
errand
but
she
had
not
much
longer
to
wait
in
a
moment
quick
light
footsteps
sounded
near
her
and
elizabeth
s
little
figure
took
shape
out
of
the
darkness
here
i
am
elizabeth
lucy
whispered
elizabeth
stepped
inside
the
door
reaching
out
to
touch
lucy
s
arm
as
she
caught
her
breath
after
her
rapid
walk
then
right
away
we
start
she
said
panting
a
little
so
soon
as
we
get
there
the
do
you
think
we
can
do
it
shan
t
we
be
stopped
asked
lucy
fearfully
the
most
they
can
do
is
to
send
us
back
elizabeth
answered
but
i
think
we
get
by
all
right
my
room
in
the
house
of
my
friend
is
close
to
the
town
s
edge
that
far
i
go
every
night
and
of
the
soldiers
who
are
here
on
guard
i
many
know
last
autumn
was
this
regiment
in
often
have
i
seen
that
big
sergeant
now
working
at
the
hospital
when
i
help
in
my
nephew
s
while
elizabeth
talked
in
a
quick
nervous
undertone
she
had
drawn
lucy
from
the
doorway
and
the
two
were
making
their
way
along
the
gloomy
street
nothing
more
than
an
occasional
lantern
lighted
the
captured
town
when
the
lights
of
the
few
occupied
houses
were
put
out
and
were
left
to
find
their
way
by
the
starlight
or
by
the
occasional
bursting
of
a
in
the
heavens
oh
i
wish
the
guns
would
not
start
again
sighed
lucy
when
a
new
burst
of
explosions
had
shaken
the
air
no
miss
lucy
it
is
better
so
elizabeth
objected
with
the
guns
firing
no
one
hears
bob
s
of
course
lucy
exclaimed
suddenly
welcoming
the
vibrations
of
the
cannon
against
her
ears
why
didn
t
i
think
of
that
oh
elizabeth
i
can
t
bear
to
think
of
the
risk
he
runs
i
wish
he
were
not
be
sure
he
comes
not
unless
a
good
chance
he
has
elizabeth
reassured
her
he
said
only
i
shall
they
had
covered
half
a
mile
through
streets
leading
to
the
town
s
outskirts
by
a
more
southerly
direction
than
the
way
lucy
had
taken
the
day
before
now
at
the
corner
of
a
street
that
remained
quite
undamaged
a
sentry
stood
out
from
the
shadow
of
the
wall
elizabeth
gave
a
sharp
glance
at
his
tall
thin
figure
and
as
they
drew
nearer
and
the
man
brought
his
gun
to
the
challenge
she
called
out
in
german
well
hans
eberhardt
don
t
you
know
me
yet
you
re
younger
than
i
am
and
should
have
better
illustration
who
s
that
with
you
the
soldier
lowered
his
piece
and
said
with
a
laugh
it
was
your
footsteps
i
was
going
to
challenge
frau
müller
i
couldn
t
see
you
in
this
then
as
the
two
approached
him
he
added
but
who
s
that
with
you
just
a
little
girl
who
helps
in
the
hospital
i
m
going
to
take
her
home
to
lucy
trying
to
follow
the
rapid
german
speech
felt
her
heart
pound
at
these
words
but
the
sentry
offered
no
objection
inquiring
sleepily
of
elizabeth
as
she
paused
close
by
him
isn
t
it
eleven
o
clock
yet
frau
i
must
have
been
on
guard
here
almost
a
it
is
nearly
ll
soon
get
off
said
elizabeth
encouragingly
what
sort
of
quarters
have
you
here
pretty
good
better
than
those
at
though
the
french
guns
haven
t
left
us
many
whole
roofs
to
sleep
under
and
donnerwetter
we
need
a
little
he
gave
a
weary
sigh
as
elizabeth
starting
on
again
at
lucy
s
side
said
with
a
friendly
nod
well
to
you
said
the
sentry
shouldering
his
gun
once
more
lucy
held
fast
to
elizabeth
s
arm
in
an
ecstasy
of
relief
as
they
walked
quickly
on
through
the
starlit
darkness
no
others
shall
we
meet
inside
the
town
elizabeth
said
softly
once
outside
we
must
be
careful
and
on
the
lookout
they
were
already
near
the
border
of
but
not
among
the
lanes
with
which
lucy
was
familiar
they
had
come
further
south
making
an
abrupt
turn
after
passing
the
sentry
away
from
the
real
route
to
elizabeth
s
lodgings
she
wished
to
give
the
german
headquarters
on
this
side
of
the
town
a
wide
berth
as
well
as
the
field
observation
post
in
the
meadow
bob
s
probable
she
and
lucy
had
discussed
that
morning
for
lucy
had
faith
in
elizabeth
s
shrewd
judgment
sharpened
by
months
of
experience
on
or
near
the
battle
line
mr
bob
dares
not
to
land
now
where
three
days
ago
you
saw
him
miss
lucy
elizabeth
said
with
certainty
nor
yet
near
the
place
where
he
let
fall
to
me
the
message
but
there
is
a
further
meadow
where
sometimes
aviators
have
the
landing
made
and
that
is
on
the
other
side
of
the
old
frenchwoman
s
house
and
nearer
to
the
wood
it
is
there
i
look
for
him
to
now
as
they
passed
the
scattered
houses
between
them
and
the
open
fields
lucy
guessed
that
they
would
come
out
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
south
of
mère
breton
s
cottage
already
she
saw
the
safety
of
the
way
elizabeth
had
chosen
for
this
corner
of
was
the
farthest
removed
from
the
german
front
and
the
least
frequented
the
fields
it
bordered
on
were
too
near
the
wood
where
the
french
batteries
had
been
hidden
to
have
been
tilled
or
cultivated
they
lay
neglected
torn
up
by
shell
holes
and
overgrown
with
weeds
the
stars
gave
light
enough
to
show
the
outline
of
mère
breton
s
cottage
among
the
trees
at
their
left
as
they
emerged
at
last
from
a
lane
into
the
grass
of
the
nearest
meadow
lucy
stumbled
a
little
as
her
feet
met
the
rough
clods
of
earth
and
elizabeth
breathing
fast
after
her
anxious
walk
said
softly
in
her
ear
we
can
sit
down
and
rest
a
while
miss
lucy
too
early
is
it
yet
for
him
to
where
shall
we
go
asked
lucy
uncertainly
near
to
the
cottage
i
think
then
we
shall
be
safely
hidden
and
can
see
around
elizabeth
nodded
cautiously
choosing
her
steps
in
the
darkness
fearful
of
the
treacherous
shell
holes
here
and
there
at
mère
breton
s
back
gate
they
paused
and
lucy
held
her
breath
listening
with
a
shiver
of
fear
for
she
knew
not
what
but
only
the
pounding
of
the
cannon
as
the
bombardment
fitfully
continued
broke
the
silence
while
far
to
the
west
on
the
battle
line
beyond
the
town
bursting
shells
threw
a
glaring
light
against
the
sky
through
the
soft
darkness
near
at
hand
a
cricket
by
the
made
a
brave
effort
to
chirp
against
the
guns
lucy
and
elizabeth
sat
down
on
the
worn
stone
steps
outside
the
gate
and
peered
across
the
fields
and
up
at
the
sky
in
anxious
expectancy
he
may
not
come
elizabeth
i
almost
hope
he
doesn
t
lucy
said
again
the
old
dreadful
fear
for
bob
clutching
at
her
heart
inside
the
gate
and
drooping
above
it
grew
a
big
lilac
bush
and
as
they
sat
there
the
night
air
shook
the
blossoms
and
floated
over
them
laden
with
fragrance
lucy
leaned
back
against
the
post
and
drank
in
the
sweet
air
in
deep
refreshing
breaths
never
again
she
thought
would
she
smell
lilacs
without
remembering
this
night
after
a
long
time
of
waiting
she
felt
certain
it
must
be
late
enough
for
bob
to
come
out
of
many
thoughts
an
idea
had
occurred
to
her
as
she
sat
gazing
up
into
the
sky
the
most
dangerous
part
of
the
descent
would
be
when
bob
drew
near
enough
to
be
seen
against
the
stars
once
in
the
black
shadow
of
the
wood
he
could
land
unseen
and
bob
knew
these
meadows
well
and
would
make
use
of
such
protection
this
meant
that
he
would
land
at
some
distance
from
where
they
were
and
she
wanted
to
be
as
near
as
possible
to
save
every
precious
minute
she
waited
a
moment
for
a
good
pause
in
the
firing
to
tell
her
thoughts
more
easily
to
elizabeth
but
before
it
came
a
sound
made
her
suddenly
clutch
at
her
companion
s
arm
in
the
distance
between
the
scattering
shots
she
heard
the
whir
of
an
airplane
silently
elizabeth
nodded
pointing
upward
toward
the
sky
above
the
wood
a
little
dark
speck
showed
for
an
instant
against
the
clear
starry
blue
then
before
lucy
s
eager
eyes
had
more
than
caught
it
sank
swiftly
down
among
the
shadowy
tree
tops
lucy
sprang
to
her
feet
not
speaking
a
word
all
her
energy
and
breath
reserved
for
that
mad
dash
across
the
fields
to
bob
s
but
elizabeth
s
hand
caught
hers
and
her
voice
entreated
don
t
run
in
the
dark
across
there
miss
lucy
surely
you
will
in
the
holes
fall
bob
will
come
this
way
himself
to
look
for
only
a
little
deterred
by
this
warning
lucy
began
running
toward
the
wood
searching
every
yard
of
ground
ahead
of
her
and
narrowly
avoiding
more
than
once
a
bad
fall
into
a
yawning
shell
hole
close
at
hand
elizabeth
was
soon
lost
sight
of
but
she
could
not
stop
to
wait
before
long
her
breath
began
to
come
hard
and
fast
and
her
back
to
ache
unbearably
from
leaning
forward
as
she
ran
to
watch
for
dangerous
ground
on
she
went
until
presently
a
wide
field
lay
between
her
and
mère
breton
s
cottage
a
hummock
in
the
grass
at
one
side
made
her
dodge
a
little
to
the
left
uncertainly
it
looked
like
an
animal
asleep
but
as
she
came
closer
it
moved
and
up
beside
her
sprang
a
tall
figure
two
strong
arms
were
around
her
trembling
shoulders
while
a
familiar
voice
said
quickly
in
her
ear
it
s
bob
lucy
m
not
a
boche
that
s
what
i
took
you
for
oh
i
had
been
lucy
gasped
as
she
caught
tight
hold
of
him
and
glanced
shivering
into
the
darkness
don
t
wouldn
t
have
got
me
i
shan
t
fall
tamely
into
their
hands
a
second
suddenly
his
fingers
on
lucy
s
arm
stiffened
who
s
that
it
s
elizabeth
i
ran
ahead
of
her
where
shall
we
go
bob
won
t
you
be
safer
close
by
your
machine
we
re
near
enough
i
can
see
all
around
me
here
elizabeth
can
tell
me
where
the
guards
are
posted
i
bet
she
knows
them
all
oh
lucy
and
here
bob
s
momentary
cheerfulness
collapsed
with
a
dismal
groan
i
never
thought
this
could
you
should
be
left
here
they
beat
us
back
with
six
full
divisions
jerusalem
many
men
they
must
have
lost
for
we
gave
them
a
good
fight
though
we
were
outnumbered
three
to
don
t
mind
can
t
help
it
and
i
m
all
right
before
long
we
ll
surely
get
the
town
that
s
what
we
hope
for
is
father
doing
well
he
must
have
been
nearly
wild
when
he
knew
you
couldn
t
get
yes
but
you
know
how
calm
he
is
when
things
are
really
wrong
he
s
better
in
spite
of
i
m
thankful
for
that
here
s
bob
took
a
few
steps
forward
and
caught
hold
of
the
little
german
woman
s
arm
as
she
came
panting
up
to
them
you
re
a
brick
elizabeth
he
said
with
eager
earnestness
i
was
so
afraid
you
wouldn
t
get
the
message
or
understand
i
might
have
known
you
would
i
ve
hung
over
these
meadows
looking
for
you
again
and
again
since
the
town
was
oh
yes
bob
i
understand
the
message
all
right
nodded
elizabeth
breathing
fast
it
was
just
like
you
showed
me
and
you
are
don
t
get
hurt
she
asked
the
same
affectionate
anxiety
in
her
voice
as
when
she
watched
over
lucy
s
welfare
i
m
as
fine
as
a
fiddle
look
here
elizabeth
where
s
the
nearest
outpost
more
than
half
a
mile
from
here
bob
pretty
safe
you
are
here
and
i
a
good
watch
will
keep
while
you
say
all
you
want
to
the
little
bob
i
m
so
frightened
for
you
said
lucy
trembling
afresh
when
any
pause
in
the
firing
made
the
little
night
noises
audible
around
them
why
did
you
come
because
i
had
to
see
you
and
know
that
you
were
safe
father
too
you
can
imagine
how
mother
and
cousin
henry
have
felt
since
was
oh
bob
you
ve
seen
mother
where
is
she
lucy
cried
in
a
burst
of
relief
and
longing
she
is
near
our
line
about
fifteen
miles
of
here
that
s
where
the
trains
were
those
carrying
that
she
couldn
t
get
on
she
tried
every
possible
mule
and
she
would
have
made
it
on
foot
if
the
town
had
held
out
another
day
come
let
s
sit
down
on
this
bank
and
stop
shaking
like
that
i
m
all
they
dropped
down
beneath
a
ragged
row
of
poplars
which
separated
the
field
from
its
neighbor
as
bob
continued
i
was
so
thankful
to
have
the
good
news
of
father
s
recovery
for
her
at
the
same
time
that
she
heard
of
the
town
s
capture
now
i
can
at
least
tell
her
something
of
you
you
re
in
the
hospital
lucy
do
the
germans
let
us
run
it
as
before
i
know
something
of
what
goes
on
in
t
stop
now
to
tell
you
i
know
that
the
town
is
held
by
only
a
company
and
that
the
enemy
is
too
fagged
out
to
do
more
than
care
for
their
own
make
us
care
for
them
you
mean
said
lucy
but
where
can
you
get
news
from
never
mind
now
tell
me
more
of
mother
oh
how
often
i
ve
thought
of
her
and
longed
to
tell
her
i
was
safe
it
s
elizabeth
being
here
with
you
that
has
comforted
her
most
did
you
find
elizabeth
that
day
i
told
you
she
might
still
be
here
the
day
you
landed
over
there
on
the
meadow
you
never
told
me
said
lucy
puzzled
suddenly
a
light
broke
through
her
mind
was
that
what
you
tried
to
tell
me
as
you
started
off
i
couldn
t
hear
a
word
with
the
propeller
bob
put
his
arm
suddenly
about
her
in
the
darkness
and
looked
up
into
the
starry
sky
if
only
i
could
take
you
back
with
me
he
groaned
it
seems
too
awful
to
leave
you
here
but
i
have
to
cross
the
german
lines
and
their
guns
and
scouts
are
fiendishly
watchful
my
little
nieuport
can
skim
over
their
heads
and
dodge
them
with
a
i
need
a
fellow
in
front
of
me
pumping
a
machine
gun
for
all
he
s
he
fell
silent
for
a
despairing
moment
then
said
more
calmly
never
mind
lucy
just
be
a
plucky
sport
i
won
t
leave
you
here
long
if
i
have
to
bring
a
squadron
after
you
if
only
we
could
force
them
out
of
argenton
that
s
the
place
where
they
threaten
to
outflank
us
if
we
at
the
name
argenton
lucy
all
at
once
forgot
the
sickening
fear
and
ache
of
her
own
heart
in
a
vivid
recollection
that
was
the
place
where
captain
beattie
had
been
taken
what
makes
it
so
hard
to
get
through
there
bob
she
asked
eagerly
you
mean
the
enemy
is
too
strong
not
don
t
need
a
large
force
there
s
a
long
fortified
ridge
in
front
of
the
town
that
keeps
us
from
approaching
it
s
a
piece
of
rolling
ground
about
three
miles
long
their
trenches
run
through
it
and
they
have
a
collection
of
guns
and
we
hang
over
the
place
day
in
and
out
but
we
can
t
fly
low
enough
to
get
sight
of
their
would
any
one
who
had
been
in
their
trenches
know
what
you
want
to
learn
asked
lucy
peering
into
her
brother
s
face
through
the
darkness
of
he
wasn
t
blind
but
people
who
have
reached
their
trenches
from
our
side
haven
t
come
back
to
tell
us
look
here
lucy
what
i
want
more
than
anything
to
know
is
this
do
you
get
enough
to
eat
if
you
don
t
i
can
manage
to
bring
over
supplies
on
nights
when
things
look
quiet
and
leave
them
in
the
oh
no
bob
please
lucy
entreated
the
hospital
has
a
garden
and
the
place
is
so
packed
with
german
wounded
that
we
get
all
there
is
to
be
had
i
know
the
danger
you
run
to
come
here
and
i
don
t
want
you
to
try
it
again
much
as
i
long
to
see
as
bob
sat
in
troubled
helpless
silence
for
the
moment
she
added
quickly
but
if
i
should
learn
anything
that
might
help
the
allies
to
retake
the
town
how
could
i
get
news
to
you
what
could
you
learn
you
foolish
kid
there
s
nothing
about
this
town
we
don
t
know
and
for
heaven
s
sake
don
t
put
your
finger
into
such
a
risky
business
keep
out
of
anything
like
spying
and
be
satisfied
to
help
where
it
is
safe
elizabeth
might
not
get
you
out
of
trouble
as
she
did
do
you
know
of
a
place
called
the
old
prison
somewhere
in
asked
lucy
irrelevantly
yes
it
s
about
a
mile
from
here
it
s
nothing
but
an
old
jail
the
french
used
as
a
sort
of
town
office
keeping
one
or
two
cells
for
an
occasional
prisoner
we
let
out
some
french
soldiers
the
germans
had
stuck
there
when
we
took
the
town
why
have
they
any
one
in
there
now
yes
i
heard
of
some
one
being
put
there
said
lucy
briefly
i
think
i
remember
the
place
now
bob
she
added
anxiously
don
t
you
think
you
d
better
go
it
seems
as
though
the
firing
were
much
heavier
i
ll
be
so
horribly
worried
about
your
getting
please
don
t
be
i
ll
keep
way
over
their
heads
and
play
safe
how
i
wish
i
could
leave
you
and
father
some
good
news
but
i
can
t
except
to
promise
you
that
won
t
stay
in
german
hands
one
second
after
we
can
take
lucy
choked
down
a
sob
and
thankful
that
the
darkness
hid
her
eyes
brimming
with
tears
of
lonely
wretchedness
threw
her
arms
about
bob
s
neck
in
a
desperate
embrace
give
mother
my
dearest
love
she
said
huskily
in
his
ear
tell
her
i
m
safe
and
please
go
now
elizabeth
said
bob
having
a
hard
time
with
his
own
unsteady
voice
take
care
of
her
won
t
you
and
whenever
you
cross
that
field
keep
a
lookout
for
yes
bob
assented
elizabeth
patting
the
tall
young
aviator
on
the
shoulder
with
a
loving
hand
tell
your
mother
she
should
not
too
much
worry
over
miss
lucy
i
do
my
best
for
i
know
you
will
said
bob
with
some
relief
in
his
heavy
anxiety
another
moment
and
he
was
swallowed
up
in
the
shadows
while
lucy
and
elizabeth
stood
gazing
after
him
with
straining
eyes
their
ears
on
the
alert
for
every
sound
though
nothing
could
be
heard
around
them
just
then
in
the
noise
of
the
cannon
still
silent
and
motionless
they
stood
there
after
bob
had
gone
with
eyes
lifted
now
to
the
sky
above
the
wood
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
little
nieuport
rose
like
a
winged
speck
over
the
tree
tops
lucy
clutched
elizabeth
s
arm
her
heart
pounding
intolerably
there
he
is
there
he
is
she
whispered
her
mind
hovering
between
relief
that
bob
had
got
safely
away
from
german
territory
and
dread
of
what
he
had
still
to
face
another
second
and
the
little
monoplane
had
disappeared
in
the
blue
and
elizabeth
was
tugging
at
lucy
s
arm
and
saying
earnestly
in
her
ear
come
miss
lucy
we
should
go
back
quickly
now
lucy
turned
away
from
the
wide
starry
spaces
on
which
her
eyes
were
still
fixed
and
obedient
to
elizabeth
s
urging
began
to
retrace
her
steps
across
the
fields
behind
her
old
nurse
s
cautious
feet
she
walked
mechanically
her
eyes
on
possible
shell
holes
but
her
mind
far
distant
lucy
s
moments
of
fear
and
weakness
had
one
redeeming
feature
they
were
usually
followed
by
a
great
scorn
of
herself
in
which
her
courage
and
endurance
rose
to
a
high
pitch
so
it
was
with
her
now
after
the
despairing
terror
which
had
made
her
hold
fast
to
bob
and
forget
half
she
had
to
say
to
him
at
the
moment
of
parting
at
sight
of
him
flying
back
through
the
night
to
make
his
perilous
way
among
the
swarming
german
planes
above
the
trenches
all
her
courage
returned
to
her
she
could
do
nothing
toward
bob
s
safety
but
while
he
was
in
danger
she
would
do
the
one
thing
in
her
power
which
might
be
of
some
distant
help
to
the
allies
elizabeth
she
said
as
together
they
made
a
difficult
way
through
a
tangle
of
bushes
near
mère
breton
s
cottage
i
m
going
back
by
way
of
the
old
but
why
miss
lucy
for
what
elizabeth
demanded
in
amazement
stopping
short
to
catch
her
breath
as
quickly
as
she
could
lucy
told
her
of
the
encounter
of
two
days
ago
with
the
young
englishman
and
of
her
hopes
that
he
might
have
some
of
the
information
bob
so
sorely
needed
elizabeth
listened
with
no
answering
enthusiasm
for
the
risky
project
but
the
vigorous
objections
which
she
launched
when
lucy
paused
in
her
rapid
explanation
fell
on
deaf
ears
you
needn
t
come
with
me
i
can
find
the
place
and
there
are
so
few
sentries
i
know
i
can
keep
out
of
their
way
was
the
only
answer
vouchsafed
her
in
her
impulsive
resolution
lucy
forgot
elizabeth
s
larger
share
in
the
dangers
of
the
expedition
she
had
only
one
thought
just
then
to
succeed
in
her
undertaking
and
this
required
such
a
desperate
keying
up
of
her
own
courage
as
to
make
her
thoughtless
for
her
kind
and
unselfish
companion
oh
miss
lucy
i
beg
you
not
to
go
implored
elizabeth
in
a
last
attempt
to
dissuade
the
determined
girl
from
her
purpose
to
this
lucy
returned
doggedly
it
s
all
i
can
do
for
bob
and
i
must
do
elizabeth
sighed
despondently
but
her
faithful
affection
answered
without
hesitation
on
her
own
account
very
well
if
you
must
i
go
with
oh
thank
you
dear
elizabeth
i
knew
you
d
help
me
cried
lucy
with
genuine
relief
and
gratitude
now
come
into
mère
breton
s
garden
till
i
show
you
what
i
m
going
to
along
with
lucy
s
mad
eagerness
to
learn
from
captain
beattie
s
lips
what
he
knew
of
the
defenses
of
which
bob
himself
had
told
her
might
free
from
german
another
and
more
womanly
motive
for
her
visit
to
the
prison
the
sight
of
her
brother
had
reminded
her
of
the
young
prisoner
who
had
so
aroused
her
admiration
and
pity
she
could
not
help
bob
to
safety
but
could
she
not
do
something
for
this
other
boy
now
that
chance
had
brought
her
within
possible
reach
of
him
she
thought
to
herself
how
she
would
despise
an
english
girl
who
could
have
seen
bob
taken
off
to
prison
as
she
had
seen
captain
beattie
without
lifting
a
finger
to
ease
his
unhappy
fate
somewhere
this
young
officer
s
family
was
waiting
anxiously
for
news
of
him
and
hoping
that
one
kind
hand
might
be
stretched
out
to
offer
him
help
and
comfort
while
she
thought
this
lucy
had
entered
mère
breton
s
garden
and
feeling
for
elizabeth
in
the
shadowy
darkness
said
softly
gather
some
of
whatever
you
can
find
i
know
where
the
eggs
are
put
after
they
are
collected
in
the
evening
i
m
going
for
the
little
was
not
far
off
where
the
basket
of
eggs
was
nightly
placed
inside
the
door
lucy
felt
for
the
key
upon
the
roof
unlocked
the
door
and
putting
in
her
hand
took
out
half
a
dozen
eggs
and
tied
them
in
her
handkerchief
she
felt
no
compunction
about
making
off
with
the
old
frenchwoman
s
property
she
and
mère
breton
had
talked
together
in
confidence
and
lucy
knew
that
this
food
was
far
better
destined
in
her
eyes
than
if
it
had
gone
down
the
throats
of
the
german
wounded
she
hurried
back
across
the
garden
and
found
elizabeth
collecting
a
small
supply
of
the
only
ripe
vegetables
to
be
had
just
then
got
them
she
asked
breathing
hard
with
uncontrollable
excitement
all
right
come
they
stole
out
of
the
gate
into
the
meadow
and
now
elizabeth
trying
to
resign
herself
to
the
attempt
since
she
could
not
prevent
it
asked
anxiously
what
shall
we
do
there
miss
lucy
better
we
think
of
that
now
while
there
is
well
first
how
far
from
here
is
the
prison
lucy
hoped
it
was
no
farther
than
bob
had
said
she
knew
her
courage
would
not
last
forever
only
a
little
way
after
we
reach
the
town
i
know
the
shortest
way
but
always
a
guard
there
is
when
in
daylight
i
have
passed
the
place
no
good
it
will
do
there
that
i
am
german
miss
lucy
for
i
have
not
any
excuse
to
make
him
for
lucy
thought
for
a
minute
i
don
t
believe
there
are
many
guards
do
you
elizabeth
no
only
one
i
because
bob
said
there
were
cells
on
just
one
side
if
i
can
only
get
to
his
window
and
talk
with
him
for
five
minutes
it
will
be
enough
it
doesn
t
seem
as
though
they
would
watch
the
prisoners
all
the
no
more
likely
they
very
little
watch
but
oh
miss
lucy
i
am
not
sure
how
it
will
be
and
i
wish
you
do
not
go
i
must
try
elizabeth
be
nice
and
just
think
how
to
help
the
most
instead
of
worrying
i
know
we
will
be
all
very
well
i
help
you
all
i
can
agreed
elizabeth
with
quiet
resignation
she
spoke
not
another
word
of
protest
as
entering
the
silent
abandoned
streets
they
stole
cautiously
along
the
town
s
outskirts
toward
the
south
after
a
few
moments
walk
elizabeth
pointed
to
an
open
square
ahead
at
one
corner
of
which
a
low
building
gloomed
against
the
sky
a
church
with
the
steeple
shot
away
rose
opposite
it
there
is
the
prison
elizabeth
said
in
lucy
s
ear
the
cells
are
on
the
other
now
that
they
were
near
to
danger
elizabeth
seemed
once
more
to
take
command
of
things
miss
lucy
you
must
here
in
the
shadow
stay
she
continued
quickly
while
i
go
to
see
who
is
on
guard
better
i
some
excuse
can
make
alone
if
he
should
see
without
waiting
for
an
answer
she
was
gone
and
lucy
shrank
close
against
the
brick
wall
of
the
house
behind
her
and
stood
there
with
suddenly
quaking
heart
and
ears
listening
vainly
for
any
other
sound
than
the
occasional
bursts
of
shell
fire
in
five
minutes
elizabeth
was
back
again
and
the
moment
she
spoke
lucy
felt
the
joyful
relief
in
her
voice
oh
miss
lucy
she
said
softly
the
best
of
luck
we
have
the
guard
inside
the
house
was
the
office
they
are
a
couple
of
sleepy
fellows
leaning
on
their
guns
i
watch
the
door
while
you
in
back
to
the
barred
windows
go
so
soon
as
the
guard
should
move
i
come
to
warn
you
so
in
the
dark
we
safely
get
elizabeth
you
re
a
brick
lucy
whispered
squeezing
her
companion
s
hand
in
eager
gratitude
as
she
followed
her
toward
the
dark
wall
of
the
old
building
a
square
of
light
showed
on
the
side
toward
the
church
and
here
elizabeth
took
up
her
watch
from
the
shadow
of
the
corner
leaving
lucy
carrying
the
little
spoils
of
mère
breton
s
garden
in
her
cloak
to
make
her
way
to
the
right
or
prison
end
of
the
building
with
a
hard
clutch
at
her
already
waning
courage
lucy
felt
with
her
free
hand
for
the
angle
of
the
corner
on
the
rough
stone
wall
and
stepping
cautiously
around
it
reached
the
side
of
the
prison
which
opened
on
a
narrow
courtyard
she
stared
up
at
the
wall
seeing
no
break
at
first
in
its
dim
outline
but
as
she
looked
three
windows
detached
themselves
faintly
from
the
shadows
in
another
moment
she
could
see
that
each
was
with
bars
only
one
course
of
action
suggested
itself
to
her
excited
mind
and
whatever
its
drawbacks
she
dared
not
delay
she
went
close
up
to
the
first
window
and
dropping
her
cape
stood
on
tiptoe
and
put
her
face
against
the
bars
she
could
see
nothing
inside
the
room
but
making
a
trumpet
of
her
hands
she
said
captain
beattie
she
dared
not
call
out
for
as
luck
would
have
it
in
the
last
five
minutes
there
had
come
a
decided
pause
in
the
firing
and
a
loud
voice
might
very
well
carry
between
the
shots
the
occupant
of
the
cell
made
no
response
only
lucy
fancied
that
she
heard
some
one
sigh
and
the
rustle
of
a
straw
mattress
beneath
a
sleeper
s
weight
with
pounding
heart
she
stood
a
minute
longer
listening
then
stepping
back
crept
on
to
the
next
window
she
reached
up
on
tiptoe
to
grasp
the
bars
and
as
she
did
so
her
fingers
touched
something
soft
s
clothing
at
the
same
moment
a
voice
speaking
within
a
few
inches
of
her
face
asked
breathlessly
in
english
who
s
that
lucy
s
heart
gave
a
wild
throb
of
triumph
captain
beattie
she
stammered
clutching
at
the
bars
on
the
voice
was
shaky
with
bewilderment
lucy
knew
she
had
not
a
second
to
lose
she
said
hastily
you
remember
the
girl
who
translated
the
german
questions
for
you
the
day
the
town
was
taken
i
m
an
american
my
father
is
an
i
came
to
see
him
from
england
and
couldn
t
get
away
in
but
what
are
you
doing
here
now
asked
the
amazed
young
englishman
as
he
spoke
his
hand
reached
through
the
bars
for
lucy
s
as
though
to
establish
the
comradeship
of
touch
out
of
the
darkness
i
came
to
see
you
because
i
knew
you
d
be
had
a
brother
in
a
german
for
another
reason
too
but
first
she
reached
down
for
her
cape
and
gathered
up
the
meager
supplies
it
held
do
you
get
enough
to
eat
i
should
say
not
but
quite
as
much
as
i
expected
how
about
yourself
oh
i
m
all
right
i
m
in
the
hospital
and
there
is
always
enough
there
look
here
i
ve
brought
you
a
few
things
i
know
raw
eggs
are
horrid
but
they
re
nourishing
it
s
all
i
could
manage
do
you
want
them
do
i
want
them
the
rest
of
the
prisoner
s
answer
was
to
reach
through
the
bars
and
take
the
scanty
provisions
carefully
from
lucy
s
hands
you
plucky
little
kid
i
m
as
hungry
as
a
wolf
don
t
tell
me
you
came
here
all
alone
oh
no
friend
from
the
hospital
came
with
me
but
captain
beattie
please
listen
now
while
i
tell
you
she
paused
for
a
second
and
a
sudden
thought
prompted
her
to
preface
her
words
by
asking
are
you
quite
sure
i
m
all
right
and
that
you
trust
me
you
can
put
out
your
hand
and
feel
my
hair
and
face
if
you
like
so
you
ll
see
i
m
really
who
i
i
believe
you
said
the
englishman
and
his
voice
sounded
as
though
he
were
smiling
what
s
your
name
you
haven
t
told
lucy
gordon
my
brother
is
lieutenant
robert
gordon
of
the
american
aviation
no
is
he
i
ve
seen
him
from
inside
the
barred
window
lucy
heard
a
deep
sigh
as
though
the
young
prisoner
had
suddenly
realized
again
his
hopeless
captivity
she
went
on
quickly
he
came
here
to
see
me
what
here
yes
he
got
word
to
me
that
he
was
going
to
try
to
land
behind
the
town
and
i
came
out
to
meet
she
plunged
into
the
story
of
bob
s
coming
repeating
all
he
had
told
her
of
the
difficulties
in
the
way
of
the
allied
advance
and
her
own
hope
at
mention
of
argenton
that
the
young
englishman
might
have
some
of
the
information
so
vital
for
the
recovery
of
and
the
adjoining
ground
oh
if
i
could
only
have
seen
him
for
one
moment
what
a
chance
in
a
thousand
her
listener
broke
in
with
desperate
eagerness
then
you
do
know
about
argenton
you
could
have
told
him
lucy
panted
didn
t
i
walk
all
through
their
trenches
and
wait
for
hours
in
the
broiling
sun
above
their
beastly
batteries
but
i
had
no
hope
of
getting
news
of
it
to
our
lines
if
i
could
have
seen
gordon
for
five
minutes
i
never
thought
of
it
in
time
i
always
do
things
too
late
moaned
lucy
almost
in
despair
couldn
t
you
tell
me
anyhow
captain
beattie
so
that
if
he
does
come
s
going
to
try
won
t
fail
a
second
time
her
voice
shook
with
the
sobs
that
rose
uncontrollably
in
her
throat
to
have
been
so
near
success
and
to
have
missed
it
a
weight
of
disappointment
settled
on
her
heart
i
couldn
t
explain
the
defenses
to
you
now
said
captain
beattie
doubtfully
you
wouldn
t
remember
them
accurately
enough
to
do
any
good
anyhow
it
s
unlikely
that
he
ll
be
able
to
make
the
trip
never
well
i
have
paper
and
pencil
and
i
ll
draw
a
camouflaged
one
you
could
tell
him
of
course
what
it
is
but
i
don
t
think
you
ought
to
come
here
a
second
i
m
coming
i
ll
bring
you
things
to
eat
didn
t
i
tell
you
bob
had
been
in
a
german
prison
anyway
i
ve
made
such
a
mess
of
this
i
m
going
to
try
to
succeed
in
the
don
t
feel
bad
said
the
young
officer
concealing
his
disappointment
it
would
have
been
a
horrible
risk
to
bring
your
brother
so
far
as
i
can
see
the
town
is
empty
and
deserted
as
a
tomb
i
wish
you
d
go
now
yourself
though
i
m
awfully
anxious
about
you
where
is
your
friend
she
s
watching
to
see
that
your
guard
doesn
t
come
out
all
right
i
m
going
but
you
ll
see
me
soon
bless
the
young
captain
reached
quickly
through
the
bars
and
took
lucy
s
hands
in
a
warm
clasp
you
don
t
know
what
it
s
meant
to
talk
english
with
a
lucy
sprang
down
from
her
foothold
in
the
wall
and
with
one
swift
glance
about
her
through
the
darkness
picked
up
her
cape
and
stole
around
the
corner
of
the
building
elizabeth
was
still
standing
by
the
shadow
of
the
wall
but
as
lucy
came
up
she
reached
out
and
caught
her
arm
leading
the
way
swiftly
down
the
narrow
street
oh
miss
lucy
she
exclaimed
i
thought
you
never
come
i
have
prayed
for
you
every
moment
you
were
gone
the
soldiers
stay
there
but
i
feel
so
afraid
they
change
the
guard
and
i
have
no
time
to
get
to
you
i
m
sorry
i
know
i
stayed
too
i
found
him
now
that
her
disappointment
was
not
so
sharp
lucy
was
glad
that
at
least
she
had
accomplished
half
her
mission
i
ll
tell
you
all
about
it
elizabeth
where
are
we
the
hospital
no
indeed
miss
lucy
i
take
you
to
my
room
and
there
we
can
sleep
a
little
while
by
four
o
clock
we
will
back
to
the
hospital
go
so
you
will
get
there
as
soon
as
the
all
right
said
lucy
faintly
i
don
t
know
whether
i
m
sleepy
or
not
but
i
think
we
started
out
to
find
bob
about
a
week
chapter
viii
a
little
french
heroine
will
you
do
something
for
me
asked
miss
pearse
as
they
mounted
the
hospital
steps
early
in
the
morning
two
days
later
miss
willis
and
brêlet
are
going
to
the
german
supply
depot
after
some
things
we
need
i
wish
you
would
go
with
them
and
see
if
you
can
t
bring
back
more
soap
and
matches
we
want
them
terribly
and
we
always
have
to
wait
for
them
at
a
separate
door
from
the
food
depot
it
s
impossible
to
spare
any
one
else
from
here
she
added
turning
toward
lucy
a
decidedly
reproachful
look
or
i
d
keep
you
working
in
the
hospital
goodness
knows
what
you
ll
do
once
i
let
you
lucy
not
having
any
defense
ready
said
nothing
but
she
did
not
look
particularly
repentant
miss
pearse
had
come
face
to
face
with
her
outside
the
hospital
when
she
returned
the
morning
after
bob
s
visit
astonished
at
catching
sight
of
her
charge
whom
she
thought
still
in
bed
and
asleep
she
had
insisted
on
a
complete
explanation
lucy
had
received
a
scolding
but
underneath
all
of
her
severity
miss
pearse
could
not
hide
the
sympathetic
heart
that
beat
in
warm
response
to
lucy
s
hope
and
anxiety
her
lecture
had
weakly
broken
down
into
a
fire
of
questions
about
bob
s
daring
flight
which
left
lucy
feeling
less
remorseful
than
miss
pearse
intended
now
after
waiting
a
moment
while
their
passes
were
inspected
by
a
deliberate
german
sentry
she
followed
the
nurse
into
the
hospital
saying
of
course
i
ll
go
miss
pearse
right
after
breakfast
just
let
me
tell
father
colonel
gordon
was
sitting
up
in
bed
for
his
convalescence
had
now
really
begun
and
his
thin
face
from
which
the
tan
had
almost
faded
was
tinged
with
the
first
suggestion
of
returning
health
his
eyes
though
held
a
sombre
look
in
their
gray
depths
and
at
sight
of
lucy
it
did
not
leave
them
even
when
he
smiled
cheerfully
and
held
out
a
welcoming
hand
lucy
had
told
her
father
everything
about
bob
s
visit
and
the
news
that
he
had
brought
and
in
the
thrilling
story
colonel
gordon
s
fear
for
his
son
s
safety
had
been
almost
outweighed
by
admiration
of
his
pluck
and
skill
his
face
had
lighted
up
as
he
listened
and
lucy
had
repeated
the
details
of
bob
s
message
and
landing
twice
over
it
meant
much
to
the
wounded
officer
to
feel
that
if
he
himself
must
remain
a
helpless
prisoner
of
war
his
son
at
least
was
doing
a
brave
part
alone
lucy
had
not
told
him
a
word
about
her
visit
to
captain
beattie
s
prison
she
had
not
accomplished
what
she
hoped
and
she
dreaded
lest
her
father
s
fears
for
her
safety
might
lead
him
to
make
her
promise
not
to
go
there
again
just
now
she
felt
she
could
not
give
up
the
one
chance
that
might
mean
so
much
and
had
she
not
given
a
promise
too
that
she
would
do
what
she
could
to
make
the
young
englishman
s
lot
more
bearable
this
morning
she
told
her
father
of
her
intended
trip
across
the
town
for
the
supplies
doled
out
by
the
german
conquerors
colonel
gordon
lay
watching
his
daughter
with
anxious
eyes
as
she
sat
beside
him
thankful
to
see
that
her
cheeks
had
not
yet
lost
their
color
in
spite
of
all
she
had
endured
nor
her
hazel
eyes
their
brightness
i
m
all
right
father
so
long
as
i
have
work
to
do
said
lucy
reading
his
troubled
thoughts
it
was
sitting
idle
and
worrying
that
i
couldn
t
stand
now
that
you
are
getting
well
and
we
know
the
worst
about
the
town
i
can
grin
and
bear
a
weight
is
off
my
mind
since
i
know
bob
has
told
your
mother
we
are
safe
said
colonel
gordon
as
for
grinning
and
bearing
it
our
troops
won
t
be
satisfied
to
do
that
thank
heaven
they
ll
push
through
again
must
i
don
t
know
what
i
d
do
if
i
thought
i
was
a
prisoner
for
the
rest
of
the
lucy
was
silent
but
again
she
resolved
to
tell
her
father
nothing
of
the
secret
captain
beattie
held
until
she
had
revisited
the
prison
and
accomplished
at
least
a
part
of
what
she
sought
i
must
go
to
breakfast
now
father
she
said
after
a
moment
i
ll
come
in
to
see
you
again
just
as
soon
as
i
get
back
from
my
morning
s
lucy
needed
no
urging
to
do
all
in
her
power
to
help
inside
the
hospital
to
her
natural
eagerness
to
be
of
service
to
the
allies
cause
was
added
a
keen
desire
to
show
the
germans
in
command
that
she
was
useful
she
had
a
secret
dread
that
they
might
think
her
in
the
way
and
forbid
her
to
remain
where
she
longed
to
stay
close
by
her
father
s
side
the
streets
were
glowing
in
hot
sunshine
when
she
started
out
with
miss
willis
and
brêlet
an
hour
later
since
the
night
before
the
guns
had
been
almost
silent
and
every
soul
among
the
allies
in
the
town
wondered
how
things
were
going
on
the
but
steadfastly
refused
to
ask
their
conquerors
certain
they
would
hear
of
nothing
else
than
a
german
victory
but
even
the
germans
could
not
claim
much
of
an
advance
for
the
firing
of
the
past
night
showed
their
line
to
be
still
held
at
about
four
miles
west
of
the
german
food
supply
depot
was
about
a
mile
north
from
the
american
hospital
it
was
inconveniently
placed
for
both
hospitals
and
for
the
few
hundred
inhabitants
remaining
in
the
town
but
naturally
the
germans
gave
no
thought
to
this
every
one
wishing
to
buy
or
beg
food
was
obliged
to
go
in
person
showing
the
registry
card
which
had
been
furnished
each
inhabitant
soon
after
the
town
s
capture
this
systematic
arrangement
promised
well
but
in
reality
many
a
tired
and
french
citizen
had
a
long
hot
walk
to
the
supply
depot
for
nothing
the
food
was
scanty
and
only
the
worst
portions
of
it
were
reserved
for
the
townspeople
in
addition
to
this
the
long
wait
necessary
to
secure
anything
kept
those
away
who
had
a
few
vegetables
left
growing
in
their
little
gardens
the
old
men
and
boys
of
had
been
put
to
work
clearing
the
streets
of
broken
stone
and
rubbish
for
there
was
no
more
than
a
company
of
soldiers
in
the
town
and
these
contented
themselves
with
mounting
guard
and
exercising
a
general
supervision
but
the
civilian
workers
received
no
more
food
than
if
they
had
been
idle
and
hungry
and
dejected
worked
grudgingly
at
their
task
fearful
lest
they
should
be
in
some
way
aiding
the
german
advance
lucy
watched
these
unwilling
workers
as
the
three
passed
close
to
a
little
group
of
them
on
their
way
across
the
town
somehow
they
seemed
even
more
pitiful
to
her
than
soldier
prisoners
the
soldier
has
at
least
had
a
chance
to
strike
his
enemy
and
he
is
at
a
time
of
life
when
blows
are
given
and
endured
but
these
old
men
and
bent
with
labor
had
earned
a
quiet
home
in
the
little
town
where
most
of
them
were
born
the
boys
from
twelve
to
about
sixteen
years
old
glanced
up
with
shamefaced
and
defiant
looks
they
had
had
no
chance
at
and
lucy
guessed
with
a
quick
throb
of
sympathy
how
their
young
loyal
hearts
must
suffer
in
obeying
the
conqueror
s
commands
suppose
it
were
america
and
the
germans
were
ordering
us
to
work
for
them
she
thought
and
her
cheeks
flushed
with
anger
at
the
triumphant
foe
who
caused
such
misery
then
she
shook
her
head
impatiently
at
herself
as
the
house
used
for
the
food
depot
came
into
sight
i
ll
have
to
feel
a
little
more
polite
than
this
if
i
m
to
get
any
soap
and
matches
out
of
them
she
decided
there
s
not
much
of
a
crowd
thank
goodness
remarked
miss
willis
looking
at
the
scattered
handful
of
people
standing
about
the
building
but
i
suppose
there
are
enough
more
indoors
to
keep
us
waiting
half
the
well
i
ll
go
to
the
other
side
and
try
my
luck
said
lucy
making
for
the
door
and
taking
her
place
in
line
with
the
written
request
from
the
hospital
in
her
hand
presently
her
turn
came
to
step
inside
the
door
and
hand
her
paper
to
the
sergeant
at
the
desk
he
read
it
pursing
his
lips
doubtfully
glanced
at
a
written
list
beside
him
and
finally
told
lucy
to
come
back
in
half
an
hour
he
shouted
it
under
the
odd
impression
that
people
who
could
not
understand
german
would
get
his
meaning
somehow
if
he
spoke
loud
enough
lucy
nodded
wanting
to
laugh
at
his
hot
face
and
went
out
in
search
of
miss
willis
and
brêlet
the
people
of
the
hospital
owing
in
great
part
to
the
german
wounded
sheltered
there
were
in
a
much
easier
position
than
the
rest
of
the
population
in
regard
to
food
the
german
authorities
allowed
them
to
convey
the
somewhat
variable
supplies
allotted
to
them
the
chief
part
of
the
food
had
already
been
sent
over
but
some
necessary
things
were
missing
and
these
miss
willis
had
volunteered
to
bring
back
the
chances
looked
uncertain
however
the
german
in
charge
as
a
matter
of
course
appeared
doubtful
about
granting
her
request
a
lucy
entered
the
room
things
had
advanced
no
further
than
this
seeing
every
prospect
of
a
long
wait
she
glanced
about
her
to
see
who
else
was
in
the
same
plight
or
thirty
people
were
standing
wearily
waiting
on
the
sergeant
s
pleasure
some
of
them
had
sat
down
on
the
floor
and
leaned
against
the
wall
among
these
last
was
a
slight
woman
whom
lucy
noticed
because
she
seemed
so
sadly
out
of
place
seated
on
the
dusty
floor
in
the
midst
of
the
noisy
and
perspiring
crowd
she
was
plainly
dressed
in
black
with
a
widow
s
cap
over
her
soft
dark
hair
but
something
about
her
face
and
bearing
set
her
apart
from
the
peasants
and
townspeople
around
her
beside
her
stood
an
old
woman
who
was
evidently
a
servant
with
an
empty
basket
on
her
arm
and
an
angry
scowl
on
her
forehead
as
she
watched
the
german
soldiers
leisurely
dealing
out
supplies
to
the
waiting
crowd
but
it
was
the
third
member
of
the
little
group
to
whom
lucy
s
attention
quickly
shifted
this
was
a
girl
about
her
own
age
who
stood
leaning
against
the
wall
by
her
mother
s
side
a
kind
of
scornful
patience
on
her
face
her
blue
eyes
which
looked
as
though
not
long
ago
they
had
been
full
of
childish
gaiety
now
held
a
defiant
resolution
in
their
depths
her
hair
was
so
black
it
reminded
lucy
of
julia
houston
s
except
that
julia
s
hair
was
straight
and
this
girl
s
fell
in
soft
waves
over
her
thin
shoulders
lucy
could
not
take
her
eyes
away
from
that
pretty
sensitive
face
so
pathetic
in
its
look
of
having
been
roughly
wakened
from
the
happy
childhood
that
french
girls
know
until
well
into
their
teens
in
another
moment
the
object
of
her
gaze
looked
around
and
caught
sight
of
her
lucy
did
not
hesitate
she
had
longed
for
the
companionship
of
a
girl
her
own
age
since
she
had
found
time
to
think
in
these
last
few
days
and
she
had
seen
this
girl
once
before
in
crossing
the
town
with
brêlet
and
elizabeth
and
had
heard
from
brêlet
something
of
her
history
she
made
a
difficult
way
across
the
crowded
room
to
her
side
and
overcoming
a
sudden
shyness
as
the
stranger
s
eyes
met
hers
she
said
in
french
with
a
friendly
smile
you
won
t
mind
if
i
speak
to
you
i
d
like
so
much
to
have
another
girl
to
talk
for
a
second
her
listener
looked
puzzled
for
lucy
s
french
was
much
worse
than
her
german
then
her
face
lighted
comprehendingly
and
a
bright
smile
chased
away
all
the
scornful
sadness
from
her
look
i
shall
be
glad
she
exclaimed
her
pretty
voice
sounding
pleasantly
on
lucy
s
ears
after
the
shouts
of
the
german
soldiers
calling
off
the
names
upon
their
lists
then
hesitating
for
a
second
the
girl
said
in
careful
english
if
you
prefer
we
can
talk
in
english
i
speak
enough
that
you
can
understand
me
though
i
make
some
mistakes
at
every
oh
yes
cried
lucy
enormously
relieved
at
the
loosening
of
her
tongue
i
can
understand
you
perfectly
and
you
tell
me
if
i
talk
too
then
let
us
sit
on
the
floor
the
french
girl
suggested
dropping
down
as
she
spoke
against
the
wall
lucy
quickly
followed
suit
and
when
they
were
seated
side
by
side
on
the
rickety
floor
which
shook
and
creaked
under
many
footsteps
her
companion
continued
i
know
a
little
of
you
already
clemence
our
servant
has
told
me
how
you
came
here
to
see
your
a
look
of
such
keen
sympathy
shone
in
the
blue
eyes
fixed
on
hers
that
lucy
for
a
moment
could
not
speak
and
the
french
girl
added
you
are
american
no
tell
me
your
lucy
gordon
and
i
know
part
of
yours
you
are
mademoiselle
de
la
tour
but
what
is
your
first
name
michelle
it
was
the
poilu
who
was
with
you
when
you
saw
me
in
the
street
who
has
told
you
that
he
knows
well
this
town
he
you
call
it
of
my
uncle
very
near
here
before
the
brêlet
had
in
fact
told
lucy
more
of
michelle
de
la
tour
than
her
name
he
had
described
the
first
german
advance
early
in
the
war
which
had
driven
the
widow
and
her
little
daughter
from
their
beautiful
to
find
refuge
in
the
town
since
then
things
had
gone
from
bad
to
worse
with
this
family
once
so
honored
and
fortunate
madame
de
la
tour
s
only
son
was
fighting
for
his
country
while
his
mother
and
sister
were
left
poor
and
needy
in
german
hands
lucy
wondered
what
stories
of
privation
and
sacrifice
michelle
s
lips
could
tell
but
she
also
guessed
that
she
would
hear
little
of
them
impelled
by
an
instinctive
confidence
and
liking
which
made
her
feel
more
warmly
toward
this
girl
than
five
minutes
acquaintance
warranted
she
began
telling
her
a
little
of
her
own
history
of
her
coming
from
england
of
her
father
s
recovery
in
the
midst
of
the
german
advance
of
her
mother
s
vain
attempts
to
reach
them
and
lastly
she
spoke
of
bob
not
of
course
of
his
visit
since
the
town
s
capture
for
lucy
had
learned
prudence
enough
in
the
last
week
she
did
not
say
a
word
that
could
have
brought
danger
to
any
friend
of
the
allies
however
unlikely
it
was
that
her
english
would
be
understood
michelle
heard
her
with
an
eager
intentness
and
lucy
s
friendly
interest
seemed
reflected
in
her
listener
s
eyes
which
in
their
changing
brightness
expressed
her
thoughts
far
better
than
her
halting
english
at
last
she
turned
to
where
her
mother
sat
and
reached
out
an
eager
hand
to
her
i
have
a
little
here
is
my
lucy
crawled
over
and
held
out
a
dusty
hand
to
madame
de
la
tour
who
gave
her
in
return
a
firm
lingering
clasp
of
her
delicate
fingers
michelle
s
mother
had
her
daughter
s
radiant
smile
and
it
hid
for
an
instant
even
the
heavy
lines
of
weariness
and
anxiety
in
her
pale
face
i
am
very
glad
if
you
will
be
company
to
my
little
girl
she
said
in
better
english
than
michelle
s
at
the
same
time
her
dark
eyes
searched
lucy
s
face
as
though
the
terrible
years
of
doubt
dread
and
suspicion
had
made
her
slow
to
accept
any
friendship
even
one
so
innocent
as
this
little
american
s
but
lucy
s
frank
honest
glance
seemed
to
convince
her
she
patted
her
hand
and
smiled
again
as
though
the
dangers
were
forgotten
for
the
moment
in
motherly
pity
for
the
lonely
child
before
her
michelle
she
said
quickly
you
must
ask
to
come
and
visit
us
very
sad
it
must
be
for
her
always
in
the
will
you
come
asked
michelle
eagerly
yes
but
please
call
me
lucy
was
the
prompt
reply
to
which
michelle
agreed
with
a
nod
and
a
smile
saying
you
too
call
me
michelle
so
it
is
much
where
do
you
live
was
on
the
tip
of
lucy
s
tongue
but
at
that
moment
she
saw
brêlet
making
energetic
signals
to
her
across
the
room
with
a
sudden
remembrance
of
her
supplies
next
door
she
sprang
up
and
bade
her
new
friends
a
hasty
i
hope
to
see
you
very
soon
again
she
found
time
to
say
before
she
squeezed
her
way
through
the
increasing
crowd
all
right
brêlet
just
wait
a
minute
until
i
get
my
things
is
miss
willis
ready
to
go
she
asked
the
poilu
who
stood
by
the
door
his
full
basket
slung
over
his
shoulder
yes
i
will
come
with
mademoiselle
he
said
following
lucy
outside
to
the
other
door
where
a
scanty
supply
of
the
articles
she
wanted
were
handed
from
the
desk
after
a
further
wait
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
all
during
the
hot
walk
home
lucy
thought
of
michelle
and
wondered
how
soon
she
should
be
able
to
see
her
again
that
afternoon
as
soon
as
she
sat
down
to
work
on
the
torn
linen
with
elizabeth
she
asked
her
old
nurse
how
she
could
manage
to
visit
her
new
friend
you
see
i
suppose
she
works
in
the
french
hospital
with
her
mother
so
i
don
t
know
how
we
can
do
any
work
together
will
the
germans
let
me
go
to
her
house
she
asked
doubtfully
the
germans
here
not
so
many
are
that
they
will
bother
to
see
what
you
do
unless
you
the
town
try
to
leave
was
elizabeth
s
answer
when
i
in
the
morning
to
the
cottage
in
the
meadows
go
you
may
come
with
me
and
stop
at
the
house
of
your
oh
do
you
know
where
she
lives
cried
lucy
overjoyed
surely
do
i
near
by
to
where
stood
the
sentry
when
we
passed
him
the
other
lucy
left
off
working
toward
sundown
to
go
and
sit
with
her
father
and
in
him
she
had
an
interested
listener
to
elizabeth
s
plan
for
visiting
michelle
i
m
so
glad
you
ve
found
a
friend
little
daughter
he
said
with
sober
satisfaction
it
must
be
so
almighty
hard
and
lonesome
for
you
here
but
remember
you
re
never
to
cross
the
town
even
that
far
without
elizabeth
or
some
one
else
from
the
lucy
nodded
thinking
rather
guiltily
of
her
determination
to
visit
captain
beattie
on
the
first
night
that
elizabeth
was
off
duty
just
now
though
she
had
only
one
thought
in
her
head
it
is
no
small
thing
to
find
a
companion
one
s
own
age
after
many
days
spent
among
grownups
and
this
girl
had
appealed
to
lucy
from
the
first
glimpse
she
caught
of
her
in
the
street
a
week
ago
lucy
was
not
given
to
rushing
headlong
into
friendships
but
she
did
follow
her
impulses
frankly
and
on
the
whole
did
not
often
have
reason
to
regret
it
by
the
following
morning
elizabeth
had
forgotten
all
about
lucy
s
inquiries
of
the
day
before
and
looked
up
in
surprise
when
she
came
early
into
the
greeting
her
with
well
elizabeth
when
may
we
start
lucy
had
risen
at
daybreak
obtained
miss
pearse
s
consent
to
her
plan
and
arranged
breakfast
trays
for
the
convalescents
an
hour
under
the
nurse
s
direction
then
she
had
sat
with
her
father
a
while
for
it
was
early
in
the
day
that
he
felt
most
rested
and
ready
for
conversation
now
she
felt
that
it
was
time
her
wish
was
gratified
and
sighed
regretfully
when
elizabeth
answered
so
soon
as
i
can
i
will
go
miss
lucy
but
first
i
have
some
work
to
do
and
the
sergeant
must
sign
us
the
permissions
for
oh
all
right
agreed
lucy
somewhat
pacified
at
sight
of
the
breakfast
elizabeth
was
placing
on
the
table
it
was
a
beautiful
early
summer
morning
with
white
clouds
piled
against
the
soft
blue
sky
and
the
sun
just
warm
enough
to
make
the
shade
feel
pleasant
after
the
unusual
heat
of
the
past
few
days
it
was
exhilarating
to
both
mind
and
body
lucy
felt
filled
to
the
brim
with
life
and
energy
in
spite
of
herself
her
spirits
soared
with
hope
and
confidence
in
better
things
to
come
somehow
she
believed
when
she
and
elizabeth
set
out
from
the
hospital
half
an
hour
later
that
must
soon
be
restored
to
its
rightful
owners
it
seemed
as
though
this
nightmare
of
german
conquest
were
but
a
passing
thing
and
could
be
bravely
borne
with
that
assurance
there
was
nothing
whatever
to
suggest
a
change
for
the
better
in
reality
as
they
crossed
the
town
the
guns
were
still
silent
except
for
scattered
shots
the
german
sentries
still
kept
guard
over
the
desolate
streets
and
the
gangs
of
unhappy
old
men
and
boys
labored
at
the
piles
of
débris
in
sullen
submission
still
lucy
s
spirits
refused
to
be
much
dampened
in
her
mind
she
debated
schemes
for
carrying
food
to
captain
beattie
resolving
to
tell
michelle
all
about
the
prisoner
at
the
first
opportunity
look
miss
lucy
said
elizabeth
presently
as
they
neared
the
southeastern
part
of
the
town
there
is
the
house
of
madame
de
la
she
pointed
down
the
street
to
a
little
brick
house
with
a
gabled
roof
it
is
one
that
she
owns
before
but
now
she
goes
there
to
live
because
it
is
not
much
by
the
shells
in
a
minute
they
stopped
in
front
of
the
door
and
lucy
asked
eagerly
may
i
go
in
and
see
them
now
will
you
come
back
for
me
she
glanced
along
the
street
which
was
deserted
except
for
a
shuffling
old
woman
making
her
weary
way
toward
the
food
depot
and
looked
back
at
elizabeth
who
answered
thoughtfully
i
will
be
only
an
hour
gone
but
no
longer
can
i
wait
to
take
you
back
i
have
plenty
work
to
do
in
the
hospital
anyway
you
will
have
with
your
friend
a
little
visit
but
first
i
wait
to
see
if
she
is
lucy
ran
up
the
short
flight
of
steps
and
was
just
about
to
knock
on
the
door
when
it
opened
and
michelle
herself
stood
on
the
threshold
smiling
a
welcome
i
have
seen
you
by
the
window
she
explained
so
i
came
to
oh
i
m
so
glad
you
are
at
home
said
lucy
delighted
all
right
elizabeth
don
t
forget
to
come
back
for
she
followed
michelle
into
the
house
which
was
a
bare
homely
little
place
oddly
furnished
with
a
few
splendid
pieces
brought
from
the
old
home
eked
out
with
simple
stools
and
tables
got
from
near
at
hand
but
it
was
neat
and
homelike
and
that
meant
much
to
lucy
after
her
days
spent
in
the
midst
of
the
hospital
s
terrible
activity
madame
de
la
tour
had
already
gone
to
the
french
hospital
and
michelle
was
putting
the
house
in
order
while
the
old
servant
was
busy
in
the
kitchen
sit
down
upon
this
chair
she
said
to
lucy
bringing
an
old
carved
armchair
close
to
the
open
window
the
windows
had
been
open
ever
since
the
glass
was
shattered
by
the
but
now
that
summer
had
come
the
boards
which
helped
keep
out
the
winter
cold
were
put
aside
michelle
pulled
up
a
second
chair
for
herself
and
taking
some
knitting
on
her
lap
exclaimed
with
a
look
of
pleasant
anticipation
now
we
are
comfortable
no
it
is
so
long
since
i
have
company
i
feel
almost
strange
to
see
a
there
is
so
much
i
want
to
talk
about
i
can
t
think
where
to
begin
said
lucy
frankly
but
as
she
spoke
she
remembered
her
need
of
making
another
visit
to
the
old
prison
and
realized
also
that
such
chance
of
speaking
in
safe
privacy
with
michelle
might
not
come
soon
again
she
did
not
have
very
long
either
for
elizabeth
walked
fast
michelle
i
want
first
to
tell
you
about
my
brother
s
coming
here
the
other
night
she
began
quickly
your
come
here
gasped
michelle
her
english
failing
her
in
her
amazement
yes
lucy
nodded
she
plunged
into
her
story
and
repeated
the
whole
incident
of
bob
s
coming
and
of
her
own
visit
to
captain
beattie
s
prison
by
the
time
she
finished
michelle
s
eyes
were
shining
her
cheeks
were
flushed
with
pink
and
the
knitting
lay
unheeded
in
her
hands
when
lucy
stopped
for
breath
she
burst
into
such
enthusiastic
praise
and
comment
that
lucy
was
almost
overcome
goodness
i
didn
t
do
anything
she
said
hastily
for
she
had
not
told
the
story
with
any
idea
of
winning
applause
for
herself
the
reasons
i
want
you
to
know
about
it
are
first
because
i
hope
you
will
let
me
bring
things
for
captain
beattie
here
and
stop
for
them
on
my
way
to
the
prison
secondly
because
we
are
friends
and
i
wanted
to
tell
you
about
michelle
s
face
was
a
study
the
strangest
mixture
of
warm
sympathy
and
a
kind
of
puzzled
doubt
lucy
looked
at
her
wonderingly
for
she
answered
with
evident
sincerity
very
gladly
will
i
help
you
to
take
things
to
the
poor
englishman
i
will
go
with
you
if
i
long
so
to
help
a
little
bit
oh
lucy
only
to
make
pass
that
news
of
argenton
across
the
german
lines
lucy
s
heart
eagerly
responded
to
this
wish
but
a
queer
discomfort
at
the
baffling
look
in
michelle
s
eyes
kept
her
a
moment
silent
suddenly
she
realized
that
while
she
had
told
this
almost
stranger
her
dearest
secrets
michelle
on
the
other
hand
had
not
opened
her
lips
on
the
subject
of
her
brother
or
of
her
hopes
for
the
success
of
the
allies
lucy
was
too
candid
and
impulsive
to
bear
this
state
of
things
unquestioningly
she
looked
into
michelle
s
troubled
face
and
asked
why
won
t
you
tell
me
anything
about
yourself
and
your
family
michelle
i
ve
trusted
you
in
speaking
of
bob
s
coming
don
t
you
trust
me
the
french
girl
started
hesitated
looked
again
into
lucy
s
wondering
eyes
and
burst
into
a
flood
of
speech
oh
lucy
i
you
are
with
all
america
but
some
americans
are
not
enough
on
guard
against
our
enemies
for
what
you
are
a
friend
with
that
german
woman
who
has
the
husband
in
the
fight
against
us
of
course
what
a
donkey
i
am
exclaimed
lucy
relieved
beyond
words
as
things
were
thus
made
plain
to
her
i
forgot
all
about
elizabeth
michelle
or
i
should
have
guessed
what
you
might
think
from
seeing
me
always
with
her
you
see
elizabeth
was
our
old
nurse
in
i
ve
known
her
since
i
was
four
years
old
but
that
would
not
be
enough
to
make
us
real
friends
now
she
is
just
as
as
we
are
she
does
not
wish
to
see
the
kaiser
as
michelle
still
looked
utterly
unconvinced
lucy
went
back
to
tell
of
elizabeth
s
rescue
of
bob
from
german
hands
the
year
before
she
did
not
stop
until
michelle
knew
of
bob
s
confidence
in
the
german
woman
s
sincerity
of
the
message
dropped
from
the
airplane
and
of
elizabeth
s
repudiation
of
her
country
s
war
aims
and
her
promise
to
help
in
all
lucy
s
efforts
michelle
sat
silent
and
astonished
her
blue
eyes
fixed
upon
lucy
s
face
does
she
hate
germany
she
asked
at
last
oh
no
but
she
hates
the
junkers
ruling
her
it
is
for
germany
s
own
sake
that
she
is
do
you
see
what
i
mean
besides
she
loves
america
where
she
lived
so
long
it
was
the
lies
that
they
told
her
about
america
that
first
taught
her
the
michelle
reflected
for
a
long
moment
then
she
said
slowly
lucy
i
know
your
brother
would
not
be
deceived
and
i
believe
what
you
tell
me
but
it
is
hard
to
think
the
wife
of
a
boche
soldier
to
be
karl
isn
t
a
s
too
old
he
s
only
a
cook
he
was
our
cook
for
nearly
ten
years
at
home
anyway
michelle
you
know
that
i
m
all
right
and
you
will
soon
see
that
elizabeth
is
too
i
know
how
you
feel
for
i
wouldn
t
have
believed
her
myself
though
i
ve
known
and
trusted
her
so
long
if
she
had
not
brought
the
message
from
michelle
nodded
quickly
lucy
i
go
to
tell
you
now
about
my
brother
but
all
the
same
though
i
believe
you
promise
me
you
will
not
tell
the
old
nurse
a
word
of
what
i
i
promise
said
lucy
wondering
an
fear
the
look
that
madame
de
la
tour
s
glance
had
held
when
she
first
saw
lucy
s
face
lighted
michelle
s
clear
eyes
as
she
bent
forward
and
whispered
my
brother
armand
is
a
spy
for
the
french
army
once
already
after
the
first
german
victory
he
made
his
way
into
the
how
could
he
breathed
lucy
with
fast
beating
heart
sudden
glorious
possibilities
awaking
in
her
thoughts
i
tell
you
how
said
michelle
her
voice
trembling
with
pride
and
emotion
at
her
brother
s
gallant
exploit
changed
from
michelle
s
slow
and
halting
english
the
story
of
armand
de
la
tour
s
entrance
into
the
captured
town
was
this
during
an
attempted
made
by
a
dozen
germans
on
the
french
trenches
before
one
of
the
germans
fell
mortally
wounded
in
close
to
the
french
lines
armand
wearing
the
uniform
of
a
german
soldier
leaped
out
and
took
the
fallen
man
s
place
in
the
darkness
the
german
attacking
party
with
armand
among
them
regained
their
own
trenches
the
germans
surprised
at
the
sudden
pause
in
the
rifle
fire
from
the
french
side
dawn
found
the
spy
inside
the
town
having
made
a
perilous
way
in
on
pretense
of
special
duty
once
under
the
shelter
of
his
mother
s
roof
he
obtained
the
information
he
came
for
and
at
nightfall
returned
to
the
german
trenches
having
arranged
with
his
friends
on
the
french
side
a
preconcerted
time
and
place
he
went
over
the
top
in
a
pretended
attack
and
reached
his
own
lines
in
safety
this
feat
had
led
directly
to
the
capture
of
the
town
by
the
french
and
american
action
in
which
lucy
s
father
had
been
wounded
there
was
no
chance
so
far
as
the
allies
knew
of
learning
anything
in
now
but
michelle
and
her
mother
knew
that
anxiety
on
their
behalf
would
lead
armand
to
run
great
risks
to
enter
the
town
again
and
they
dreaded
lest
he
attempt
it
if
he
should
michelle
cried
lucy
thrilled
at
this
story
of
unselfish
heroism
he
could
take
back
word
from
captain
beattie
of
what
they
long
to
that
is
why
i
make
haste
to
tell
you
said
michelle
nodding
better
you
get
the
english
to
write
you
what
he
knows
and
you
bring
it
here
for
though
armand
wear
the
german
uniform
he
dare
not
show
himself
about
the
streets
look
she
added
pointing
through
the
window
there
is
the
german
woman
come
for
you
poor
thing
she
has
the
heavy
lucy
was
not
sure
whether
michelle
really
believed
in
elizabeth
or
not
but
more
than
satisfied
in
any
case
with
her
morning
s
visit
she
got
up
nodding
to
elizabeth
that
she
was
coming
michelle
rising
too
slipped
an
arm
through
lucy
s
with
shy
friendliness
as
they
went
out
toward
the
door
chapter
ix
the
fight
over
argenton
was
reading
a
letter
from
his
mother
as
he
sat
in
the
principal
room
of
a
little
farmhouse
outside
of
cantigny
the
place
had
long
been
abandoned
by
its
owners
and
now
sheltered
a
dozen
american
airmen
and
as
many
mechanics
in
spite
of
the
serious
damage
it
had
suffered
when
the
town
was
taken
bob
was
seated
on
a
stool
tilted
dangerously
as
he
propped
his
feet
against
the
what
was
left
of
it
in
a
heap
of
brick
and
mortar
fragments
the
morning
sun
streamed
in
on
the
earthen
floor
and
fell
across
his
face
as
he
read
the
closely
written
lines
his
thin
brown
cheeks
were
tinged
with
healthy
color
and
his
whole
lean
figure
in
its
khaki
looked
full
of
life
and
vigor
but
just
now
his
face
was
serious
and
sad
and
the
eyes
he
raised
from
the
letter
toward
the
sunny
window
were
darkened
with
painful
anxiety
he
could
see
his
mother
s
pale
face
before
him
as
he
read
her
lips
set
with
that
brave
firmness
that
women
learned
to
keep
in
the
midst
of
fear
and
suffering
even
in
her
letter
she
tried
to
hide
her
thoughts
and
to
write
hopefully
for
bob
s
sake
though
she
spoke
frankly
of
the
trouble
they
shared
together
i
can
think
of
nothing
but
lucy
bob
wondering
when
the
time
will
ever
come
that
i
shall
see
her
safe
and
beyond
the
power
of
the
enemy
but
since
that
night
you
saw
her
with
elizabeth
i
can
find
courage
to
hope
again
how
strange
things
dreadful
and
the
good
all
mixed
together
for
i
feel
so
sure
that
your
father
would
not
have
made
his
wonderful
recovery
if
dear
little
lucy
had
not
been
there
beside
bob
looked
up
once
more
pondering
his
reveries
these
days
were
one
long
rebellion
against
his
helplessness
all
his
courage
and
strength
of
purpose
were
not
enough
to
bring
his
little
sister
out
of
across
the
hotly
contested
battle
line
he
and
his
comrades
had
all
they
could
do
to
hold
back
the
german
tide
without
yet
advancing
to
retake
the
town
the
success
of
the
american
troops
at
cantigny
could
be
repeated
at
not
without
adequate
plans
of
attack
and
further
reinforcements
that
every
one
wanted
at
once
thank
heaven
our
men
are
coming
overseas
now
at
a
good
rate
he
thought
with
a
sudden
hope
illuminating
his
dejection
and
things
seem
just
endurable
in
the
boches
are
few
enough
there
except
those
who
are
flat
on
their
for
bob
had
news
from
inside
the
captured
town
of
which
lucy
never
guessed
his
restless
and
unsatisfactory
thoughts
were
cut
short
by
the
sound
of
a
footstep
on
the
stone
threshold
behind
him
he
swung
around
toward
the
door
while
the
newcomer
at
sight
of
him
exclaimed
here
you
are
bob
i
ve
been
looking
for
you
on
the
field
we
re
to
go
up
at
once
the
sergeant
is
running
around
with
orders
just
telephoned
from
up
the
the
speaker
was
a
young
aviator
about
bob
s
age
so
wrapped
up
in
his
leather
helmet
that
little
of
his
face
could
be
seen
but
a
pair
of
twinkling
blue
eyes
what
are
the
orders
larry
asked
bob
getting
up
and
cramming
his
letter
into
his
pocket
the
guns
don
t
seem
to
be
firing
very
no
it
s
the
same
old
business
the
french
observers
are
trying
to
get
a
peep
at
argenton
the
boche
scouts
seemed
to
be
asleep
for
a
while
and
the
french
made
some
bold
swoops
but
now
the
enemy
has
waked
up
with
a
vengeance
and
if
the
observers
are
to
see
anything
they
must
have
some
guards
to
engage
the
boche
where
are
your
duds
i
ve
got
to
go
back
to
my
plane
you
re
to
go
up
with
jourdin
i
think
he
s
got
two
fine
new
machine
guns
on
his
ought
to
bring
down
half
the
german
air
force
with
them
well
i
m
bob
slipped
into
his
flying
coat
put
on
his
helmet
picked
up
half
a
dozen
things
he
needed
and
went
out
just
as
the
sergeant
met
him
at
the
door
with
the
orders
in
his
hand
all
right
sergeant
i
m
off
he
said
returning
the
salute
where
is
major
kitteredge
do
you
know
he
s
on
the
field
sir
or
was
a
minute
ago
i
think
the
lieutenant
will
find
him
near
the
the
sergeant
pointed
across
the
farmyard
to
a
broad
field
behind
it
and
bob
nodded
to
him
as
he
started
off
the
sergeant
was
a
friend
of
his
and
bob
never
had
a
moment
s
talk
with
him
before
his
thoughts
turned
with
a
pang
at
his
heart
to
that
other
friend
sergeant
cameron
whom
he
had
left
behind
in
a
german
prison
he
had
sent
him
many
packages
of
food
and
comforts
since
then
and
had
even
received
a
printed
card
of
acknowledgment
from
him
forwarded
under
red
cross
supervision
but
what
were
presents
of
food
and
as
they
were
to
the
with
freedom
and
a
chance
to
strike
a
blow
in
the
good
cause
on
such
a
day
as
this
bob
crossed
the
farmyard
and
vaulted
the
fence
into
the
the
old
barn
had
been
converted
into
a
workshop
and
near
it
stood
a
dozen
men
preparing
for
flight
six
biplanes
were
waiting
on
the
field
to
some
of
which
the
mechanics
were
giving
a
last
careful
inspection
bob
found
major
kitteredge
beside
one
of
them
major
he
said
saluting
any
further
orders
for
me
you
are
to
go
up
as
gunner
gordon
said
the
officer
looking
up
from
the
papers
he
held
we
re
short
one
gunner
and
jourdin
wants
you
he
has
received
all
the
orders
i
have
here
so
he
will
pass
them
on
to
you
get
off
as
soon
as
yes
major
kitteredge
had
known
bob
when
bob
was
twelve
years
old
and
he
the
major
was
a
lieutenant
in
his
father
s
company
in
their
most
formal
intercourse
there
was
an
undercurrent
of
friendliness
never
quite
hidden
he
watched
bob
keenly
for
a
second
now
as
the
young
officer
crossed
the
field
to
captain
jourdin
s
side
you
are
here
eh
gordon
said
the
frenchman
throwing
away
his
cigarette
with
a
smile
of
welcome
then
we
will
lead
the
rest
and
be
the
first
off
the
he
drew
on
his
gloves
and
shouted
orders
to
his
french
mechanics
who
shouted
back
mon
capitaine
through
the
whirling
of
a
propeller
close
by
the
big
biplane
in
which
bob
now
took
the
front
or
gunner
s
seat
strapping
himself
in
behind
the
two
machine
guns
was
a
far
different
craft
from
the
little
monoplane
in
which
he
had
landed
behind
foreseeing
that
night
that
he
might
have
to
dodge
and
fly
for
his
life
he
had
chosen
one
of
these
swift
strong
little
hornets
capable
of
performing
the
most
breakneck
evolutions
at
incredible
speed
but
this
morning
he
and
jourdin
were
out
to
face
and
force
back
the
enemy
and
the
spad
was
built
for
combat
jourdin
gave
him
the
plan
of
operation
in
a
few
quick
sentences
the
biplanes
were
to
act
each
one
independently
attempting
to
drive
off
as
many
as
possible
of
the
enemy
planes
from
their
own
scouts
at
the
same
time
they
must
keep
a
sharp
lookout
for
whatever
information
they
might
be
in
a
position
to
pick
up
we
will
fly
north
to
then
on
to
argenton
he
finished
try
the
gordon
all
right
bien
partons
he
shouted
to
his
mechanic
who
responded
by
giving
a
twirl
to
the
propeller
which
sent
it
spinning
jourdin
opened
his
throttle
and
pressed
forward
on
the
control
stick
they
were
off
down
the
field
in
a
buoyant
bounding
rush
bob
settled
himself
comfortably
fastening
the
flap
of
his
helmet
jourdin
pulled
back
his
stick
and
the
machine
steadied
to
a
glide
swaying
ever
so
little
the
rushing
grass
disappeared
from
alongside
and
in
a
moment
the
earth
had
grown
a
distant
scene
below
in
ten
minutes
they
were
flying
swiftly
northward
at
a
height
of
four
thousand
feet
two
other
flyers
had
risen
from
the
field
after
them
and
were
in
close
pursuit
no
enemy
planes
as
yet
disturbed
the
solitude
and
bob
fell
to
looking
over
his
machine
guns
the
cold
air
of
these
high
spaces
blowing
pleasantly
against
his
face
jourdin
led
the
way
confidently
for
the
little
squadron
and
where
he
led
any
airman
was
well
content
to
follow
in
half
an
hour
they
were
over
while
below
them
the
german
trenches
spouted
fire
from
guns
the
bombardment
at
this
point
was
not
heavy
the
enemy
s
persistent
attempt
to
push
the
french
and
american
line
further
west
having
met
with
dismal
failure
a
few
german
airplanes
darted
up
from
their
guard
over
the
trenches
but
jourdin
had
no
desire
to
engage
in
battle
here
he
pointed
his
machine
upward
and
bob
had
no
more
than
a
glimpse
of
the
little
town
that
meant
so
much
to
him
before
they
had
mounted
to
five
thousand
feet
just
below
the
clouds
which
hung
under
the
deep
blue
arch
in
soft
fluffy
piles
below
them
the
enemy
planes
had
given
up
the
chase
the
town
was
only
a
little
square
made
up
of
dots
and
lines
before
it
where
the
trenches
ran
rose
little
smoky
puffs
that
hung
in
the
still
air
even
the
bursting
of
the
shells
was
deadened
to
a
dull
roar
captain
jourdin
spoke
through
the
tube
we
ll
go
a
little
higher
gordon
and
hide
behind
those
clouds
we
shall
sight
the
enemy
any
moment
now
and
shall
have
the
advantage
if
we
take
him
while
he
spoke
was
left
behind
argenton
was
only
fifteen
minutes
distant
again
he
pointed
the
big
plane
upward
another
thousand
feet
into
the
midst
of
a
great
enveloping
smothering
bank
of
cloudy
vapor
the
soft
cottony
mass
gave
way
dissolving
into
clinging
wisps
of
fog
that
trailed
along
with
them
like
streamers
then
they
burst
through
a
hole
in
the
cloud
roof
into
the
upper
world
of
celestial
loveliness
often
as
bob
had
risen
above
the
clouds
he
could
never
do
it
without
marveling
anew
at
the
strange
beauty
around
him
when
the
airplane
pushed
its
way
through
the
last
foggy
barriers
no
sky
however
beautiful
seen
from
the
earth
could
compare
with
the
absolute
clearness
of
the
dazzling
blue
about
them
below
the
clouds
were
banked
again
into
close
white
masses
tinged
here
and
there
with
a
gold
edge
where
the
sun
struck
them
a
mile
behind
came
following
two
growing
part
of
the
squadron
which
it
seemed
to
bob
had
laid
aside
for
the
moment
all
thought
of
battle
and
like
themselves
were
idly
exploring
this
upper
dreamland
a
rift
in
the
clouds
below
put
an
end
to
these
thoughts
for
through
it
he
saw
eight
airplanes
darting
back
and
forth
maneuvering
for
position
beyond
and
below
them
near
the
narrow
line
of
the
avre
river
lay
the
town
of
argenton
and
another
mile
to
the
west
the
old
medieval
fort
behind
the
fortified
ridge
bob
turned
his
binoculars
upon
the
moving
planes
and
as
he
focused
the
glass
he
spoke
to
jourdin
do
you
see
them
go
down
a
thousand
all
right
returned
the
pilot
promptly
he
pushed
the
stick
and
the
machine
dropped
swiftly
bob
could
see
the
allied
emblems
now
on
the
tails
of
three
of
the
planes
they
were
french
scouts
and
the
other
five
were
german
taubes
distinguished
by
their
shape
as
well
as
by
the
great
black
crosses
painted
on
their
wings
at
a
little
distance
another
group
was
swaying
in
combat
he
shifted
his
glass
to
these
and
saw
that
here
allies
and
enemies
were
equally
matched
two
french
scouts
and
one
american
were
fighting
three
german
fliers
jourdin
seemed
to
divine
his
thoughts
for
without
waiting
for
a
signal
he
bore
swiftly
down
upon
the
taubes
which
had
surrounded
the
three
frenchmen
just
below
and
were
pouring
a
deadly
fire
upon
them
the
scouts
were
willing
enough
to
run
away
but
unable
to
do
so
were
fighting
gamely
against
impossible
odds
another
moment
and
jourdin
had
brought
his
plane
and
its
weapons
into
range
bob
turned
the
trigger
handle
of
his
machine
gun
and
pumped
a
hail
of
bullets
into
the
wing
of
the
taube
nearest
him
he
saw
the
german
aviator
dart
a
glance
upward
as
he
tried
to
get
his
plane
out
of
range
in
a
quick
climbing
turn
but
before
he
could
sheer
off
his
wing
hung
warped
and
crippled
the
silk
out
almost
to
ribbons
the
pilot
pointed
downward
making
a
try
for
a
landing
on
one
wing
three
thousand
feet
below
bob
saw
no
more
of
him
he
turned
his
gun
on
a
taube
which
had
abandoned
the
scouts
and
was
firing
at
him
with
furious
and
accurate
aim
the
bullets
whizzed
about
the
big
but
jourdin
did
not
remain
an
easy
target
he
took
a
dropped
in
short
circles
for
a
thousand
feet
then
came
up
again
behind
the
enemy
two
more
americans
had
now
arrived
to
engage
the
taubes
and
the
scouts
were
out
of
danger
jourdin
spoke
into
the
tube
at
bob
s
ear
we
ll
go
on
west
we
re
not
needed
here
i
should
like
to
follow
our
scouts
who
are
making
for
the
as
he
spoke
they
mounted
a
little
and
flew
off
toward
the
edge
of
the
town
marked
by
the
german
trenches
a
second
plane
of
the
squadron
followed
them
as
they
crossed
the
french
lines
and
flew
over
the
enemy
s
trenches
above
the
fortified
ridge
below
the
gunners
were
sending
up
a
continuous
fire
of
shells
to
hinder
their
further
descent
around
them
hovered
the
french
scouts
vainly
endeavoring
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
camouflaged
defenses
through
the
curtain
of
fire
and
smoke
spread
out
beneath
them
it
isn
t
a
bit
of
use
bob
thought
bitterly
after
half
an
hour
of
this
useless
watching
what
can
we
see
from
here
we
are
keeping
the
boches
from
sending
more
planes
after
our
scouts
but
what
does
that
amount
to
as
he
fumed
in
helpless
impatience
scheming
a
desperate
attempt
to
penetrate
that
curtain
of
fire
jourdin
s
calm
voice
in
its
english
came
to
him
with
a
shock
of
reality
we
ll
go
down
now
gordon
i
have
orders
to
report
at
noon
through
the
field
telephone
station
near
here
behind
our
lines
our
squadron
can
be
called
together
and
at
least
put
some
of
these
taubes
out
of
the
combat
the
scouts
can
accomplish
nothing
all
right
bob
answered
reluctantly
he
was
roused
to
the
point
where
it
was
hard
to
give
up
without
having
done
anything
more
than
scare
off
a
few
german
fliers
well
the
day
s
not
over
he
consoled
himself
casting
a
resentful
glance
down
at
the
german
defenses
along
the
ridge
where
smoke
and
flame
were
spouting
from
a
dozen
batteries
the
pilot
s
feet
were
on
the
rudder
and
already
the
plane
was
making
westward
again
across
the
french
lines
though
captain
jourdin
was
flying
only
temporarily
with
the
americans
at
cantigny
he
had
been
given
orders
to
report
the
morning
s
events
to
headquarters
because
he
could
do
so
with
the
greatest
ease
and
dispatch
to
most
of
the
american
fliers
the
country
along
the
battle
line
was
still
a
thing
to
be
puzzled
out
with
the
aid
of
maps
and
glasses
by
day
and
stars
and
compass
by
night
but
to
jourdin
it
was
old
and
familiar
ground
for
this
part
of
picardy
was
his
home
and
these
ruined
fields
and
villages
he
had
known
since
boyhood
bob
thought
of
argenton
only
as
a
town
half
destroyed
by
a
place
he
could
always
find
easily
from
above
because
of
the
towers
of
the
old
fort
behind
the
blazing
line
of
german
batteries
but
to
the
frenchman
it
had
a
different
meaning
it
was
the
little
town
whose
quaint
cobbled
streets
he
had
often
passed
through
on
summer
days
in
his
childhood
to
visit
his
grandfather
whose
old
home
outside
argenton
was
now
a
ruin
if
it
was
late
enough
in
the
afternoon
the
peaceful
townsfolk
had
brought
their
babies
out
to
the
old
fort
to
hear
the
sunset
bugle
and
see
the
soldiers
change
guard
no
one
would
have
believed
in
those
days
that
the
germans
would
ever
hammer
at
its
gates
and
take
possession
behind
the
french
lines
the
country
stretched
in
rolling
fields
to
a
burned
wood
jourdin
steered
for
a
little
clump
of
larches
beside
which
was
a
telephone
shack
sheltered
by
a
bit
of
rising
ground
bob
had
the
glasses
at
his
eyes
and
swiftly
picked
out
a
to
the
right
it
a
hundred
yards
before
you
dip
there
s
a
nice
level
bit
before
those
the
pilot
leisurely
studied
the
ground
shut
off
his
gas
and
glided
beautifully
downward
until
the
earth
rose
to
meet
them
with
a
rush
and
the
wheels
of
the
big
plane
touched
and
ran
along
the
grass
to
a
gradual
standstill
bob
unstrapped
himself
and
got
out
glad
to
stretch
his
legs
but
the
next
moment
he
caught
sight
of
a
wire
slightly
out
of
adjustment
on
the
plane
s
broad
wing
and
pointed
it
out
to
his
companion
that
can
t
be
left
jourdin
shall
i
fix
it
while
you
go
to
report
there
s
a
mechanic
in
the
shack
i
ll
bring
him
out
said
jourdin
if
we
wait
for
the
repair
let
us
take
this
chance
to
eat
our
ration
on
the
ground
we
shall
have
fifteen
good
idea
said
bob
with
enthusiasm
as
jourdin
walked
off
toward
the
shack
he
brought
out
the
little
packages
of
food
and
laid
them
on
a
convenient
rock
for
a
moment
he
forgot
his
disappointment
at
the
morning
s
failure
nothing
can
rouse
such
an
appetite
as
flying
and
bob
had
not
yet
learned
to
enjoy
a
meal
snatched
on
the
wing
he
could
read
write
think
in
fact
do
many
things
during
a
swift
flight
but
he
liked
to
eat
on
level
ground
when
jourdin
returned
and
set
the
mechanic
to
work
the
two
young
aviators
took
off
their
gloves
and
helmets
and
sitting
down
devoured
their
rations
of
sandwiches
and
chocolate
along
with
a
canteen
of
cool
water
a
gentle
breeze
was
blowing
from
the
west
across
the
blackened
fields
it
blew
the
drifting
smoke
away
from
them
and
except
for
the
noise
of
the
shells
it
seemed
almost
peaceful
in
the
deserted
meadow
above
them
the
airplanes
still
floated
but
none
very
near
for
the
time
being
the
french
scouts
had
given
up
their
search
on
a
little
rising
ground
not
far
off
stood
a
ruined
windmill
its
burned
stumps
of
arms
stretching
out
dismally
above
level
earth
that
had
once
been
a
green
there
was
an
old
brick
chimney
near
it
that
was
left
of
a
little
farmhouse
the
allies
have
got
that
much
back
anyway
bob
thought
the
boches
were
here
last
captain
jourdin
had
risen
to
his
feet
and
was
looking
off
across
the
fields
in
silence
more
than
once
in
their
familiar
intercourse
bob
had
recognized
moments
when
the
frenchman
s
devoted
heart
was
bitterly
wrung
and
his
whole
mind
distracted
from
his
work
at
sight
of
some
such
hard
reminder
of
his
country
s
fate
the
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
clenched
themselves
tightly
together
as
turning
he
said
to
bob
i
remember
the
windmill
when
that
farm
was
a
prosperous
little
place
the
farmer
had
lived
there
many
bob
could
not
think
of
any
answer
there
was
no
asking
for
pity
or
encouragement
in
jourdin
s
calm
melancholy
voice
it
held
more
of
resolute
defiance
than
any
german
s
burst
of
bravado
bob
thought
of
the
lines
he
had
read
in
an
english
paper
a
few
days
before
they
were
spoken
by
a
frenchman
looking
over
the
ruined
fields
of
france
almost
as
though
the
writer
had
seen
jourdin
s
shining
dark
eyes
and
written
for
him
and
we
that
remember
the
windmill
spinning
we
may
go
under
but
not
in
vain
for
our
sons
shall
come
in
the
new
beginning
and
see
that
the
windmill
spins
again
est
fini
mon
said
the
coming
up
with
a
quick
salute
and
a
backward
gesture
toward
the
airplane
bob
picked
up
his
helmet
while
jourdin
followed
the
man
over
to
inspect
his
work
bob
looked
up
into
the
blue
sky
streaked
with
feathery
cloud
streamers
devoutly
hoping
for
better
success
in
the
afternoon
s
offensive
a
desperate
eagerness
took
hold
of
him
once
more
he
had
learned
a
part
of
the
secret
of
the
french
soldier
s
it
means
to
be
fighting
to
rescue
one
s
family
and
his
father
and
lucy
were
prisoners
in
it
is
all
right
now
said
jourdin
turning
as
bob
came
up
from
a
critical
examination
of
the
wing
s
supports
let
us
get
off
at
once
look
there
he
pointed
upward
to
where
three
german
planes
were
deliberately
crossing
the
french
lines
from
which
several
aircraft
quickly
rose
to
intercept
them
most
of
our
little
squadron
stayed
near
to
engage
the
enemy
there
said
captain
jourdin
i
think
we
shall
be
needed
to
help
drive
these
fellows
as
he
spoke
so
modestly
of
what
might
be
expected
of
him
the
light
of
battle
shone
in
the
frenchman
s
eyes
he
hurriedly
completed
his
preparations
for
flight
bob
no
less
eager
seconded
him
in
silence
with
one
more
quick
glance
at
the
planes
now
circling
overhead
in
five
minutes
they
were
off
down
the
meadow
and
rising
swiftly
toward
the
scene
of
the
fight
no
sooner
had
the
germans
seen
the
french
planes
mounting
to
the
attack
than
they
sent
reinforcements
from
their
own
lines
evidently
the
persistent
hovering
of
the
allies
scouts
over
the
argenton
defenses
was
beginning
to
annoy
them
according
to
their
usual
tactics
when
suffering
from
wounded
dignity
they
prepared
to
take
the
offensive
as
the
carrying
bob
and
jourdin
approached
a
height
of
six
thousand
feet
and
came
on
a
level
with
the
combatants
the
situation
had
not
as
yet
advanced
beyond
a
skirmish
there
were
eight
enemy
and
seven
allied
planes
not
counting
the
newcomer
which
evened
the
numbers
of
the
french
and
american
planes
three
were
heavy
machines
from
the
cantigny
squadron
the
remaining
five
light
scouting
craft
the
germans
were
all
armored
planes
but
three
were
of
a
heavy
type
almost
invincible
by
bullet
fire
but
unable
to
quickly
follow
up
an
advantage
jourdin
gave
one
keen
look
around
him
as
though
summing
up
the
odds
then
spoke
through
the
tube
to
bob
we
have
a
good
chance
of
victory
gordon
but
we
ll
have
to
fight
hard
for
it
bob
was
already
convinced
of
that
he
caught
sight
of
larry
eaton
on
his
left
pouring
a
murderous
fire
from
his
lewis
gun
into
the
heavy
german
craft
maneuvering
beside
him
but
he
also
saw
the
man
who
skilfully
guided
the
boche
machine
into
position
for
a
swift
retaliation
on
larry
s
flank
this
pilot
was
von
arnheim
the
german
for
whom
bob
had
been
exchanged
one
of
his
feet
had
been
rendered
useless
by
shrapnel
fragments
but
that
had
not
prevented
his
returning
to
the
air
service
his
eyes
shone
out
from
behind
his
helmet
with
all
his
old
reckless
audacity
and
bob
felt
his
determination
harden
and
his
courage
mount
to
fearlessness
at
sight
of
him
a
big
german
plane
swooped
down
upon
him
as
these
thoughts
took
shape
he
saw
the
gunner
jerking
his
weapon
into
range
a
bare
second
quicker
than
his
enemy
bob
began
pumping
his
port
machine
gun
a
jet
of
flame
burst
out
and
the
next
moment
the
german
machine
quivered
its
planes
twisted
to
one
side
and
like
a
shot
bird
it
fell
from
sight
through
the
tube
bob
faintly
heard
jourdin
shout
to
the
out
i
ll
put
you
in
range
he
had
no
time
to
take
breath
after
his
recent
victory
before
two
more
of
the
enemy
were
upon
him
the
privilege
of
flying
with
the
famous
french
ace
had
its
perils
too
every
boche
who
could
manage
to
do
so
made
for
jourdin
hoping
to
down
the
hero
who
once
already
disposed
of
had
returned
by
some
miracle
to
active
service
jourdin
brought
his
machine
around
in
a
climbing
turn
to
avoid
one
aggressor
while
bob
pressed
the
handle
of
his
starboard
gun
hoping
to
rid
himself
of
his
opponent
instead
of
the
burst
of
flame
which
should
have
resulted
the
gun
remained
bob
frantically
maneuvered
his
other
gun
into
position
but
the
boche
had
opened
a
deadly
fire
upon
him
bullets
spattered
through
the
wings
and
whizzed
around
him
at
the
same
instant
a
third
enemy
descended
from
above
suddenly
a
machine
gun
began
firing
from
the
other
side
bob
saw
larry
eaton
s
face
behind
it
and
the
next
moment
his
newest
antagonist
wavered
tilted
and
the
wreck
hurtled
down
six
thousand
feet
to
earth
bob
could
catch
only
a
glimpse
of
this
for
jourdin
had
grasped
the
need
of
a
momentary
retreat
he
made
a
fell
a
thousand
feet
then
having
thrown
off
his
enemy
rose
in
a
climbing
circle
while
bob
remedied
the
jam
in
his
gun
and
looked
around
for
further
developments
he
had
not
long
to
wait
close
beside
him
a
german
plane
was
getting
into
range
and
now
it
began
a
heavy
fire
in
the
midst
of
a
series
of
plunging
dives
which
did
not
allow
bob
to
return
the
fire
with
any
effect
jourdin
made
another
hoping
to
come
up
beneath
the
enemy
but
the
german
was
too
quick
for
him
he
dived
again
and
came
up
in
a
swift
turn
beside
the
frenchman
pouring
out
a
hail
of
bullets
bob
was
at
a
white
heat
of
rage
once
more
jourdin
he
shouted
the
pilot
dived
again
simultaneously
with
the
german
and
this
time
the
enemy
was
caught
at
his
own
game
jourdin
slowed
up
and
let
the
other
plane
sweep
past
as
the
boche
shot
upward
he
followed
close
in
his
wake
and
for
the
first
time
bob
poured
shot
after
shot
from
a
range
of
a
few
feet
the
big
german
machine
continued
swiftly
upward
then
it
lost
speed
fell
tail
foremost
recovered
and
finally
to
the
ground
bob
drew
a
long
hard
breath
and
glanced
below
him
the
allies
were
holding
their
own
but
two
of
them
were
missing
of
the
german
planes
three
were
gone
he
saw
no
more
than
this
before
another
airman
made
for
him
in
a
climbing
turn
the
two
planes
were
in
easy
range
and
each
gunner
began
to
pour
a
deadly
fire
on
his
opponent
the
bullets
spattered
around
bob
over
the
big
plane
and
lost
themselves
in
space
and
still
both
machines
remained
uninjured
jourdin
maneuvered
with
all
his
skill
for
an
advantage
but
his
antagonist
matched
him
at
every
turn
bob
had
not
even
to
snatch
a
look
at
the
enemy
pilot
to
know
whose
hand
was
on
the
throttle
von
arnheim
pale
and
sat
behind
his
gunner
as
though
calmly
awaiting
victory
but
it
would
not
be
quite
so
easy
as
that
bob
thought
his
mind
was
wildly
excited
so
that
the
sudden
burning
pain
in
his
left
shoulder
seemed
to
be
only
a
part
of
his
mad
eagerness
jourdin
dipped
and
rose
with
incredible
skill
the
fire
from
the
enemy
was
growing
haphazard
as
the
target
dodged
in
every
direction
and
bob
s
steady
hand
on
the
trigger
grew
steadier
as
his
brain
grew
hot
and
throbbing
suddenly
jourdin
gave
a
shout
the
gunner
of
the
enemy
plane
fell
forward
across
his
starboard
gun
von
arnheim
snatched
at
the
weapon
beside
him
but
in
that
second
bob
had
sent
a
burst
of
fire
through
his
right
plane
the
german
gave
one
flashing
glance
at
the
torn
wing
and
pushed
upon
his
stick
his
big
machine
pointed
swiftly
downward
the
next
instant
jourdin
followed
but
this
time
bob
s
fire
was
less
accurate
in
that
dizzy
descent
at
three
thousand
feet
jourdin
stopped
in
his
downward
flight
and
hovered
for
von
arnheim
useless
wing
and
all
had
guided
his
plane
to
a
safe
landing
inside
the
german
lines
for
a
second
bob
s
disappointment
outweighed
all
his
victories
as
his
eyes
followed
his
enemy
s
retreat
he
had
risked
death
to
go
down
inside
his
own
lines
and
bob
understood
that
feeling
he
thought
von
arnheim
would
have
it
in
much
stronger
measure
if
he
had
ever
endured
the
german
sort
of
captivity
bob
knew
that
never
again
could
he
let
himself
be
taken
prisoner
from
the
french
trenches
over
which
they
floated
came
a
faint
sound
of
voices
he
peered
over
the
side
of
the
cockpit
and
saw
hands
and
helmets
waved
in
the
air
they
were
cheering
his
heart
leaped
with
a
sudden
exultation
then
he
glanced
upward
the
allies
were
four
to
there
at
any
rate
jourdin
do
you
hear
them
cheering
he
asked
through
the
tube
and
as
he
spoke
a
strange
and
painful
weakness
overpowered
him
until
he
clutched
at
the
hot
barrel
of
the
gun
at
his
right
cautiously
he
felt
of
his
aching
shoulder
and
drew
away
a
hand
wet
with
blood
so
that
s
it
he
murmured
i
ll
have
to
go
back
m
sorry
he
said
unsteadily
the
pilot
s
quick
eyes
had
already
seen
the
red
stain
oozing
through
bob
s
torn
leather
sleeve
with
a
swift
touch
he
sent
the
plane
speeding
through
the
air
at
ninety
miles
an
hour
its
nose
pointed
above
the
silver
ribbon
of
the
avre
back
toward
the
safe
shelter
of
cantigny
chapter
x
the
plan
of
the
defenses
was
a
dull
gloomy
day
with
rain
clouds
dissolving
into
showers
at
intervals
and
the
streets
of
looked
sad
and
sodden
in
their
battered
abandonment
only
an
occasional
german
soldier
wrapped
in
his
poncho
or
a
woman
hurrying
by
with
a
shawl
over
her
head
passed
in
front
of
the
hospital
within
things
looked
dreary
too
lucy
thought
as
in
her
little
cap
and
apron
she
helped
brêlet
wheel
the
last
of
the
convalescents
into
the
hall
off
the
old
court
of
justice
for
the
past
three
days
she
had
undertaken
the
task
of
finding
amusement
and
occupation
for
fifteen
or
twenty
men
on
the
road
to
recovery
and
she
had
found
it
the
hardest
kind
of
work
since
her
own
spirits
were
none
too
high
or
hopeful
some
of
the
convalescents
were
germans
too
and
lucy
had
not
quite
mastered
the
red
cross
motto
of
neutrality
but
she
was
cheerful
and
felt
equal
to
doing
her
very
best
the
most
trying
work
grows
easier
if
it
is
done
in
pleasant
company
and
major
greyson
had
obtained
from
the
german
senior
surgeon
an
indifferent
consent
for
michelle
de
la
tour
to
help
occasionally
among
the
convalescents
at
the
american
hospital
there
michelle
sat
now
by
one
of
the
windows
opening
on
the
garden
talking
to
a
french
soldier
with
bandaged
eyes
lucy
smiled
across
the
room
at
her
and
in
her
gratitude
for
her
friend
s
presence
on
this
dark
and
depressing
morning
she
seated
herself
by
the
side
of
a
young
german
who
leaned
languidly
back
in
his
chair
still
weak
from
fever
what
would
you
like
paul
she
asked
kindly
some
water
all
a
she
rose
to
bring
the
water
and
after
satisfying
half
a
dozen
other
demands
for
it
helped
brêlet
distribute
the
few
books
and
papers
available
among
those
well
enough
to
read
some
of
the
men
who
felt
too
weak
to
make
any
effort
were
wheeled
in
front
of
the
windows
though
the
outlook
of
driving
rain
on
crumbling
walls
lucy
did
not
think
particularly
cheering
for
the
wounded
poilus
it
was
extraordinary
though
how
little
attention
it
took
to
brighten
up
a
soldier
s
tired
face
often
a
few
words
were
enough
to
start
them
talking
among
themselves
of
the
twenty
in
the
hall
eight
were
americans
and
the
poilus
always
got
some
amusement
in
practising
their
english
on
their
new
allies
michelle
far
more
inventive
and
resourceful
than
lucy
made
up
her
mind
at
once
to
help
find
occupation
for
the
convalescents
maman
and
i
have
already
done
so
in
our
hospital
she
said
eagerly
it
is
not
so
of
course
we
can
do
what
for
instance
asked
lucy
puzzling
we
can
t
possibly
get
any
more
german
ones
and
the
german
patients
have
too
many
of
those
no
but
there
are
other
ways
michelle
insisted
we
have
many
willows
over
by
mère
breton
s
cottage
i
have
brought
the
young
branches
for
our
poilus
to
cut
with
the
knife
and
weave
oh
they
are
glad
to
have
work
in
their
fingers
also
clemence
and
i
dug
the
clay
from
the
little
brook
near
the
old
château
it
is
far
from
here
they
send
a
boche
soldier
with
us
i
know
well
the
place
for
armand
and
i
were
friends
in
the
peace
with
the
children
of
the
château
the
poilus
can
make
of
the
clay
all
kinds
of
cups
and
bowls
i
know
that
is
pleasant
work
for
armand
and
i
have
made
them
when
i
was
sick
long
ago
and
he
played
with
i
never
thought
of
those
things
michelle
said
lucy
but
in
the
same
breath
she
added
doubtfully
who
will
show
them
how
to
make
baskets
can
you
oh
you
will
find
more
than
one
soldier
here
who
already
knows
only
we
have
to
bring
the
willow
twigs
and
they
will
make
of
them
baskets
in
one
i
ll
get
some
i
can
go
to
the
meadows
if
elizabeth
comes
with
me
i
must
stay
a
while
with
paul
schwartz
now
michelle
he
is
not
well
and
i
said
i
would
look
after
i
will
come
with
you
for
a
moment
said
michelle
making
a
wry
face
but
hiding
her
feelings
quickly
they
will
never
let
me
come
here
to
help
if
i
do
nothing
for
the
boches
he
looks
not
so
as
the
rest
i
a
poor
silly
the
german
to
whom
michelle
gave
this
unusual
praise
had
certainly
nothing
bold
nor
ferocious
about
him
as
he
lay
weakly
back
in
his
chair
his
blue
eyes
wandered
about
the
hall
with
a
kind
of
vague
curiosity
his
blond
hair
lying
in
uncut
locks
against
his
pale
face
for
the
little
that
lucy
had
seen
of
him
he
had
been
quiet
and
melancholy
making
few
demands
on
her
attention
or
on
that
of
the
nurses
so
far
she
had
not
felt
interested
enough
to
ask
him
questions
but
this
morning
as
she
sat
down
beside
him
with
sewing
in
her
hands
she
could
think
of
no
other
way
to
amuse
him
where
do
you
live
paul
she
asked
wrinkling
her
forehead
a
little
over
the
effort
of
speaking
german
michelle
laughed
at
her
labored
accent
but
the
soldier
understood
her
and
his
dull
blue
eyes
lighted
up
a
trifle
at
her
words
i
come
from
the
he
answered
nodding
his
head
slowly
as
he
spoke
as
though
for
him
the
simple
fact
was
full
of
meaning
oh
do
you
said
lucy
suddenly
reduced
to
silence
his
words
held
a
strange
meaning
for
her
too
the
black
forest
in
which
she
had
never
set
foot
was
familiar
ground
nevertheless
all
elizabeth
s
stories
in
the
old
days
had
been
about
it
it
was
full
of
gnomes
and
she
knew
the
people
you
first
met
when
you
ventured
into
it
were
hansel
and
gretel
going
toward
the
house
built
of
cake
and
candy
she
had
never
thought
of
german
soldiers
living
there
what
did
you
do
in
the
forest
paul
she
asked
vaguely
i
lived
there
said
the
soldier
his
interest
growing
with
awakening
recollection
in
my
little
house
with
my
family
just
inside
the
forest
s
border
i
am
a
and
we
had
a
fine
herd
of
pigs
the
market
town
is
not
three
miles
had
a
donkey
the
light
died
out
of
his
eyes
as
he
looked
gloomily
down
at
his
injured
leg
lucy
thought
she
had
never
seen
a
man
so
unfitted
to
be
a
soldier
how
long
have
you
been
fighting
asked
michelle
her
eyes
lifted
suddenly
to
his
face
the
german
seemed
uncertain
yes
he
added
nodding
thoughtfully
it
must
be
all
that
time
since
the
day
i
got
my
papers
and
was
told
to
join
my
regiment
at
the
village
i
heard
how
the
russians
were
getting
ready
to
invade
the
fatherland
then
how
the
english
would
attack
us
on
the
other
side
at
first
my
wife
hoped
they
would
not
call
were
so
many
others
they
said
too
that
we
could
quickly
beat
the
enemy
but
they
did
call
he
ended
with
a
dull
melancholy
that
took
the
little
life
out
of
his
face
i
had
to
leave
everything
and
go
i
don
t
know
how
things
are
with
hedwig
but
the
russians
weren
t
invading
germany
said
lucy
indignantly
while
michelle
flashed
a
warning
glance
at
her
she
lowered
her
voice
but
finished
obstinately
nor
the
english
yes
that
is
what
we
heard
maintained
paul
indifferently
our
kaiser
called
us
to
defend
the
fatherland
it
was
all
strange
to
me
for
we
don
t
get
much
news
there
in
the
michelle
smiled
at
lucy
s
flushed
and
angry
face
it
is
no
use
to
talk
with
him
of
that
she
said
in
english
with
a
shake
of
the
head
he
would
not
understand
in
many
days
the
kaiser
told
him
allons
marchez
s
all
he
lucy
was
silent
a
moment
were
you
ever
in
the
black
forest
michelle
she
asked
giving
up
her
argument
oh
yes
often
two
summers
i
have
been
there
it
is
big
and
michelle
s
eyes
shone
with
the
words
as
though
at
the
remembrance
of
happy
summer
days
gone
by
what
are
there
in
it
besides
germans
lucy
asked
smiling
to
herself
at
the
question
bears
said
michelle
and
many
animals
herds
of
pigs
too
like
this
man
s
many
live
near
the
border
and
further
in
are
lodges
for
i
ve
always
wanted
to
go
there
said
lucy
rather
sadly
i
don
t
care
so
much
about
it
oh
it
is
lovely
still
michelle
objected
perhaps
when
the
war
is
ended
the
germans
will
not
be
so
many
i
have
a
pretty
little
girl
paul
interrupted
them
she
has
hair
like
yours
he
pointed
to
lucy
s
head
with
one
upraised
finger
she
must
be
years
old
lucy
smiled
faintly
she
tried
to
imagine
this
man
on
the
engaged
in
a
fierce
fight
for
the
allies
trenches
he
was
the
very
opposite
to
karl
s
brutal
and
aggressive
type
yet
he
was
driven
forward
by
the
same
irresistible
force
of
blind
obedience
perhaps
more
than
one
allied
soldier
had
met
death
by
his
hand
the
vision
of
the
led
her
thoughts
back
into
another
channel
with
a
quick
pang
at
her
heart
that
was
half
fear
and
half
eager
anticipation
the
coming
night
elizabeth
would
be
off
duty
and
the
time
had
come
for
a
second
visit
to
captain
beattie
s
prison
the
evening
promised
to
be
dull
and
rainy
lucy
was
thankful
at
the
prospect
of
cloudy
darkness
in
place
of
summer
starlight
michelle
had
crossed
the
hall
to
visit
another
convalescent
and
lucy
rose
too
nodding
to
paul
who
had
relapsed
once
more
into
silent
apathy
her
mind
was
so
filled
with
the
evening
s
expedition
and
with
her
desire
to
talk
to
michelle
about
it
that
her
thoughts
wandered
for
a
moment
the
american
soldier
by
whom
she
had
sat
down
to
translate
a
french
paper
of
a
month
back
remarked
shrewdly
as
he
glanced
at
his
little
nurse
got
somethin
on
your
mind
miss
he
bent
down
to
her
ear
and
spoke
in
a
loud
whisper
they
haven
t
pushed
on
again
look
here
you
don
t
want
to
believe
all
these
fritzes
tell
you
no
no
said
lucy
smiling
they
haven
t
got
on
an
inch
major
greyson
says
he
can
tell
by
the
guns
when
he
goes
to
the
depot
at
that
end
of
the
town
shall
i
read
you
this
she
asked
looking
over
the
old
paper
again
you
ll
have
to
be
patient
though
for
i
can
t
translate
french
very
at
noon
she
got
the
moment
with
michelle
for
which
she
had
been
waiting
she
caught
her
friend
by
the
arm
as
she
was
returning
to
the
nurses
room
to
take
off
her
cap
and
apron
michelle
wait
a
minute
what
about
tonight
she
asked
eagerly
michelle
darted
a
look
of
angry
reproach
from
her
blue
eyes
she
drew
lucy
after
her
in
silence
into
the
room
and
over
to
a
window
opening
on
the
deserted
garden
oh
lucy
she
faltered
will
you
not
be
careful
she
caught
lucy
s
hands
in
hers
and
looked
entreatingly
into
her
downcast
face
do
you
know
it
is
my
brother
s
life
that
is
in
danger
if
they
should
suspect
me
there
are
germans
all
around
us
here
waiting
to
learn
of
any
help
given
to
their
enemies
if
they
suspect
me
they
will
watch
our
will
catch
armand
if
he
she
spoke
so
low
lucy
could
hardly
hear
her
but
she
understood
and
hung
her
head
in
sharp
remorse
and
shame
i
m
sorry
michelle
i
m
an
idiot
she
said
humbly
lucy
had
not
michelle
s
long
and
bitter
experience
to
develop
her
powers
of
caution
and
concealment
she
was
not
made
for
a
conspirator
and
her
frank
and
candid
nature
did
not
easily
get
used
to
a
life
in
which
walls
had
ears
as
truly
and
as
perilously
as
in
any
old
story
of
intrigue
and
adventure
can
we
talk
safely
here
do
you
think
she
asked
timidly
yes
but
speak
softly
said
michelle
flashing
a
forgiving
smile
you
wish
to
tell
me
the
hour
when
i
should
look
for
you
she
asked
once
more
growing
grave
and
earnest
yes
we
will
be
there
as
near
to
nine
o
clock
as
possible
of
course
we
can
t
be
come
to
the
door
by
the
garden
know
i
will
have
ready
all
that
we
can
spare
it
is
oh
he
ll
be
glad
to
get
it
i
can
t
bring
much
from
here
said
lucy
she
had
nothing
to
give
but
a
part
of
her
own
scanty
food
but
remembering
the
young
englishman
in
his
dismal
captivity
how
trifling
her
sacrifice
seemed
i
will
watch
for
you
oh
lucy
i
hope
all
goes
well
michelle
s
eyes
were
troubled
as
she
spoke
but
lucy
feeling
courageous
at
that
moment
smiled
back
at
her
saying
don
t
worry
the
night
will
be
too
dark
for
any
one
to
see
us
look
there
s
the
old
frenchwoman
returning
from
the
with
her
basket
was
standing
outside
the
garden
gate
glancing
doubtfully
past
the
sentry
toward
the
hospital
window
michelle
bade
lucy
a
hasty
and
drawing
her
pass
from
the
pocket
of
her
dress
made
for
the
door
into
the
garden
elizabeth
had
taken
on
herself
the
task
of
setting
the
nurses
table
and
bringing
in
their
food
so
as
to
watch
over
lucy
and
see
that
she
had
enough
to
eat
it
was
now
and
lucy
left
the
window
to
help
in
carrying
in
the
meagre
supplies
a
platter
of
baked
potatoes
a
pot
of
coffee
and
two
slices
apiece
of
coarse
black
bread
was
what
the
nurses
sat
down
to
after
a
hard
morning
s
work
but
they
were
hungry
enough
to
find
it
good
lucy
was
too
but
curbing
her
appetite
she
managed
in
the
course
of
the
meal
to
slip
her
two
potatoes
and
a
slice
of
bread
into
her
apron
pocket
unnoticed
it
was
little
enough
she
felt
to
take
a
hungry
man
but
the
dairy
supplies
were
strictly
reserved
for
the
wounded
and
she
saw
no
chance
of
getting
to
mère
breton
s
cottage
that
day
she
could
only
hope
with
michelle
s
help
to
eke
out
a
tolerable
meal
she
felt
the
injustice
of
not
confiding
in
her
faithful
companion
the
real
need
for
their
visit
to
the
prison
but
she
had
promised
michelle
not
to
reveal
a
word
of
her
brother
s
possible
coming
to
any
one
but
captain
beattie
as
on
the
night
of
their
first
visit
lucy
made
a
pretense
of
going
early
to
bed
she
had
no
difficulty
in
leaving
the
empty
house
unobserved
and
ten
o
clock
found
her
and
elizabeth
on
their
way
to
the
eastern
edge
of
the
town
the
rain
still
fell
and
the
wind
blew
in
gusts
around
the
street
corners
and
sweeping
through
the
in
the
walls
brought
down
loose
bricks
which
fell
with
a
sodden
crash
lucy
and
elizabeth
had
coats
wrapped
closely
about
them
but
in
a
few
moments
they
were
drenched
by
the
warm
pelting
downpour
their
feet
stumbled
among
loose
stones
and
splashed
into
puddles
lucy
stared
helplessly
ahead
into
the
darkness
trusting
entirely
to
elizabeth
for
guidance
in
half
an
hour
not
having
met
even
a
sentry
they
stole
up
the
garden
path
to
the
side
door
of
the
de
la
tours
house
and
michelle
instantly
admitted
them
oh
poor
things
but
you
are
wet
like
from
the
river
sit
down
lucy
pauvre
stay
one
moment
by
the
kitchen
fire
she
exclaimed
at
sight
of
the
soaked
and
bedraggled
visitors
oh
no
we
can
t
wait
said
lucy
pushing
her
wet
hair
from
her
face
eager
to
get
on
and
accomplish
her
purpose
before
her
courage
failed
it
s
only
a
warm
rain
rather
like
let
me
go
with
you
begged
michelle
bringing
out
a
little
basket
she
had
got
ready
and
looking
entreatingly
at
lucy
maman
has
gone
to
bed
she
will
not
know
to
be
afraid
for
me
i
do
not
want
that
you
should
have
all
the
no
no
mademoiselle
elizabeth
hastily
interposed
enough
it
is
that
i
fear
for
miss
lucy
you
can
nothing
do
to
help
and
much
better
you
do
not
she
s
right
michelle
there
s
nothing
you
could
do
i
m
going
to
bring
the
paper
he
gives
me
here
so
that
it
will
be
she
had
almost
blurted
out
captain
de
la
tour
s
name
when
elizabeth
was
risking
so
much
to
help
them
it
seemed
absurd
to
lucy
that
michelle
should
still
suspect
her
a
startled
look
sprang
into
the
french
girl
s
eyes
but
lucy
gave
her
a
reassuring
smile
to
show
that
she
had
not
forgotten
her
promise
and
cautiously
opened
the
door
michelle
she
whispered
in
another
moment
they
were
out
in
the
rain
again
with
the
little
basket
of
food
carefully
protected
beneath
elizabeth
s
shawl
it
was
but
half
a
mile
further
to
the
prison
and
after
fifteen
minutes
walk
through
the
empty
streets
lucy
stood
once
more
before
the
barred
windows
in
the
wall
the
drip
drip
of
the
rain
against
the
stone
was
the
only
sound
except
the
occasional
boom
of
a
cannon
from
the
watchful
german
lines
elizabeth
had
taken
up
her
post
commanding
the
window
of
the
but
a
curtain
was
drawn
to
shut
out
the
rain
and
all
was
silent
inside
even
german
guards
relax
their
vigilance
with
so
little
to
fear
as
in
deserted
and
ruined
they
knew
their
prisoners
were
securely
barred
and
bolted
in
lucy
grasped
the
wet
iron
and
pulled
herself
up
a
step
to
the
window
s
level
softly
calling
the
young
officer
s
name
no
sound
came
back
but
the
steady
drip
of
the
rain
which
fell
upon
her
upturned
face
captain
beattie
she
said
again
imploringly
some
one
stirred
on
a
rustling
straw
bed
and
footsteps
sounded
on
the
stone
floor
then
the
englishman
s
voice
from
just
inside
the
bars
asked
uncertainly
is
that
you
lucy
gordon
then
with
a
little
more
of
its
natural
energy
the
voice
out
of
the
darkness
added
but
you
poor
child
what
a
night
to
be
out
why
did
you
come
again
i
told
you
i
would
said
lucy
peering
through
the
bars
in
a
vain
attempt
to
see
beyond
them
this
sort
of
night
is
the
safest
to
come
the
rain
doesn
t
hurt
me
i
have
something
for
you
captain
beattie
i
can
t
get
the
basket
through
the
bars
will
you
hold
out
your
hands
you
ve
brought
me
some
grub
you
little
friend
in
need
exclaimed
the
prisoner
with
a
sudden
shake
in
his
low
voice
can
you
honestly
spare
it
i
bet
you
can
oh
yes
indeed
i
have
plenty
here
i
ll
put
the
things
into
your
hands
they
are
only
two
baked
potatoes
some
bread
and
eggs
and
a
little
chocolate
be
right
i
see
now
where
your
hand
i
hate
to
be
a
funker
but
i
m
horribly
hungry
admitted
the
young
officer
as
his
careful
hands
drew
in
the
contents
of
the
little
basket
they
give
us
the
most
beastly
food
i
m
all
right
get
along
but
it
s
jolly
to
have
a
friend
like
the
attempt
at
cheerfulness
in
his
sad
voice
struck
at
lucy
s
heart
i
ll
come
often
captain
beattie
i
ll
bring
you
all
i
can
she
promised
eagerly
no
you
won
t
lucy
you
mustn
t
you
don
t
mind
if
i
call
you
lucy
i
ll
tell
you
why
i
like
to
i
have
a
little
sister
named
least
she
was
a
kid
like
you
before
the
war
when
we
used
to
be
together
now
she
s
eighteen
and
learning
to
be
a
nurse
but
i
always
think
of
her
as
a
little
of
course
you
may
call
me
that
i
m
so
glad
if
i
can
cheer
you
up
the
least
bit
didn
t
i
tell
you
that
my
brother
bob
was
in
a
german
prison
yes
see
here
said
captain
beattie
suddenly
how
about
that
brother
of
yours
i
don
t
suppose
he
s
been
able
to
pull
off
that
stunt
again
no
but
i
want
the
plan
of
the
defenses
bob
may
not
come
again
nor
i
get
word
to
him
but
i
ve
found
another
she
stopped
for
a
second
looking
fearfully
back
into
the
rainy
darkness
then
turned
once
more
to
the
window
and
told
him
of
the
chance
of
armand
de
la
tour
s
coming
when
she
had
finished
her
listener
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
he
said
slowly
it
s
pretty
doubtful
that
he
will
get
into
the
town
again
still
those
french
spies
have
incredible
skill
and
daring
anyway
it
s
a
chance
and
i
ll
give
you
the
paper
i
have
it
all
ready
and
hidden
in
the
straw
of
my
he
went
further
back
into
the
room
and
after
a
minute
returned
to
the
window
can
you
put
it
where
it
will
keep
dry
lucy
it
s
only
drawn
on
a
scrap
of
the
paper
they
gave
me
to
write
home
oh
yes
i
ll
keep
it
dry
lucy
promised
her
heart
beating
high
with
hope
as
she
took
the
folded
slip
from
the
young
officer
s
hand
i
don
t
like
to
give
it
to
you
he
said
doubtfully
it
s
beastly
bringing
you
into
danger
i
ve
camouflaged
it
pretty
well
you
ll
see
that
it
looks
like
a
little
sketch
of
german
soldiers
changing
guard
here
in
the
road
the
crooked
road
i
ve
shaped
like
the
ridge
at
argenton
and
each
group
of
men
stands
for
a
battery
that
s
all
you
need
tell
the
frenchman
of
course
it
isn
t
complete
for
i
couldn
t
learn
everything
but
it
s
enough
to
give
our
airmen
and
gunners
the
exact
range
oh
what
luck
if
you
could
really
contrive
to
get
it
over
i
can
t
help
hoping
though
it
may
be
silly
you
ve
managed
to
do
so
much
already
under
the
boches
very
i
can
t
make
captain
de
la
tour
come
said
lucy
wistfully
but
if
he
does
i
ll
surely
get
this
to
now
go
lucy
i
can
t
bear
to
have
you
out
there
in
the
rain
and
i
don
t
feel
so
sure
of
their
not
seeing
you
it
s
so
jolly
to
have
you
to
talk
to
i
m
selfish
and
hate
to
let
you
i
m
coming
again
said
lucy
smiling
with
pleasure
at
his
words
and
at
the
happy
knowledge
of
success
in
this
much
of
her
plan
as
dripping
wet
she
clung
with
aching
fingers
to
the
rusty
bars
what
do
you
do
all
day
captain
beattie
how
i
wish
i
could
make
things
better
for
i
don
t
do
anything
i
sit
and
walk
up
and
down
and
then
sit
again
and
wonder
by
the
hour
when
we
ll
begin
to
push
the
germans
back
then
i
look
at
these
bars
and
convince
myself
i
can
t
get
out
and
end
by
longing
for
the
next
you
could
call
it
a
meal
i
ve
tried
tapping
on
the
wall
to
the
soldiers
next
to
me
but
either
they
have
gone
or
the
stone
is
too
thick
they
don
t
at
this
dismal
picture
lucy
sighed
she
knew
how
such
confinement
had
tried
bob
s
active
spirit
and
overcome
his
power
to
resist
sickness
when
it
came
she
was
about
to
offer
some
words
of
feeble
encouragement
when
a
muffled
step
around
the
corner
of
the
building
made
her
hold
her
breath
in
terror
the
next
moment
she
dropped
to
the
ground
and
crouched
on
the
wet
earth
in
the
shadow
of
the
wall
a
german
soldier
came
sauntering
by
looking
up
at
the
barred
windows
from
under
his
rubber
hood
he
seemed
to
have
no
particular
duty
here
for
he
walked
along
humming
to
himself
as
though
on
his
way
to
bed
before
he
passed
the
window
beneath
which
lucy
crouched
trembling
another
figure
came
up
behind
him
splashing
with
heavy
boots
through
the
muddy
pools
is
that
you
franz
asked
a
guttural
german
voice
yes
responded
the
man
in
front
stopping
to
wait
you
off
guard
too
for
three
time
enough
to
sleep
grumbled
the
first
speaker
why
don
t
they
send
enough
men
to
garrison
the
place
if
these
empty
streets
must
be
watched
like
because
the
front
line
needs
more
watching
still
said
the
first
man
pausing
to
cover
his
rifle
carefully
with
his
rubber
cape
those
american
are
getting
nasty
you
know
the
little
hill
with
the
old
on
it
there
s
our
weak
point
if
you
ask
me
how
could
we
hold
the
pond
and
swamp
below
when
they
won
t
spare
us
artillery
for
the
hill
i
ve
been
on
guard
there
and
i
tell
you
we
couldn
t
i
know
that
much
without
wearing
shoulder
you
seem
to
know
a
lot
remarked
the
other
man
still
suppose
you
tell
me
where
we
are
to
get
supper
they
passed
on
out
of
hearing
and
lucy
breathing
fast
with
terror
sprang
up
from
the
ground
she
whispered
to
the
darkness
of
the
window
and
fled
swiftly
but
with
infinite
caution
through
the
mud
and
water
of
the
road
toward
the
place
where
elizabeth
waited
the
talk
she
had
just
heard
meant
little
at
first
when
her
mind
was
filled
with
the
wild
thought
of
flight
but
the
gruff
words
spoken
in
that
language
she
had
learned
to
hate
stuck
in
her
memory
as
vividly
as
did
the
two
disconsolate
figures
standing
in
the
rain
before
her
chapter
xi
a
chance
in
a
thousand
looks
like
a
regular
workshop
oh
michelle
i
m
so
glad
you
thought
of
it
exclaimed
lucy
looking
around
the
hall
with
admiring
eyes
almost
every
convalescent
soldier
had
a
lump
of
clay
or
some
willow
splits
in
his
fingers
of
which
he
was
trying
to
fashion
something
pretty
or
useful
generally
without
much
success
a
few
of
the
poilus
and
germans
were
expert
basket
weavers
and
one
potter
was
among
them
the
rest
knew
enough
to
get
along
with
help
as
for
the
americans
they
caused
more
amusement
than
had
been
heard
among
the
men
in
a
long
time
not
one
of
them
could
weave
the
willow
splits
into
a
symmetrical
shape
and
only
one
succeeded
in
making
of
the
clay
anything
more
than
a
dumpy
jug
this
was
a
little
westerner
who
formed
his
lump
into
a
dozen
animals
in
as
many
minutes
to
the
great
interest
of
the
frenchmen
about
him
ending
the
exhibition
with
a
figure
of
a
cowboy
on
horseback
waving
a
lasso
made
of
a
willow
sliver
it
was
not
the
quality
of
the
work
that
made
the
two
girls
proud
and
delighted
at
the
result
of
their
hard
labor
it
was
the
atmosphere
of
interested
occupation
and
rivalry
so
different
from
the
listless
melancholy
that
takes
possession
of
a
roomful
of
idle
men
the
work
was
trifling
and
almost
useless
but
it
was
far
better
than
nothing
and
lucy
felt
well
repaid
for
her
hot
walks
and
the
heavy
loads
carried
in
her
aching
arms
it
was
two
days
since
her
visit
to
the
prison
and
she
had
spent
the
intervals
from
work
in
vain
attempts
to
scheme
out
a
means
of
getting
her
precious
paper
to
the
allied
lines
one
idea
she
communicated
to
michelle
rather
expecting
to
be
laughed
at
do
you
think
we
could
tame
one
of
the
pigeons
that
fly
around
the
hospital
roof
michelle
it
could
take
the
message
so
but
this
is
their
home
michelle
objected
you
must
have
a
bird
who
longs
to
return
across
the
is
a
stranger
here
there
were
many
like
that
guarded
here
last
month
by
the
french
i
do
not
know
where
they
are
what
an
easy
way
that
would
be
and
what
a
safe
one
lucy
thought
this
morning
as
she
went
back
and
forth
among
the
convalescents
giving
encouragement
since
she
could
not
give
advice
and
seeing
that
each
man
had
material
to
work
with
oh
how
too
bad
we
must
give
so
much
to
the
boches
whispered
michelle
as
lucy
picked
up
a
handful
of
splits
for
paul
schwartz
to
finish
his
neat
basket
but
we
have
to
said
lucy
resignedly
it
was
the
sight
of
the
german
soldiers
working
away
at
the
materials
furnished
by
the
hard
efforts
of
the
two
little
aides
which
had
caused
the
german
surgeon
in
charge
to
give
lucy
a
brisk
nod
of
approval
in
passing
she
felt
more
angry
than
gratified
at
this
condescending
reward
for
her
trouble
but
she
knew
his
good
will
was
necessary
if
they
were
to
continue
helping
the
french
and
americans
i
can
not
stay
long
with
you
this
afternoon
said
michelle
a
few
minutes
later
when
all
the
patients
were
again
supplied
with
occupation
poor
maman
does
not
get
up
she
has
a
bad
cold
from
coming
in
the
rain
from
the
i
m
so
sorry
michelle
could
i
do
anything
to
help
i
suppose
the
french
doctors
can
give
you
what
she
needs
yes
but
one
thing
i
would
like
to
ask
of
you
i
am
not
sure
if
you
can
do
the
french
girl
gave
her
friend
an
appealing
look
as
she
said
with
a
more
natural
childishness
than
she
had
shown
lucy
before
i
am
very
lonely
while
maman
is
ill
if
you
could
come
and
pass
the
night
with
would
be
michelle
of
course
i
will
i
know
how
i
can
manage
it
i
ll
go
home
with
one
objects
to
she
can
leave
me
at
your
house
it
will
be
late
though
she
can
t
leave
here
before
oh
how
glad
i
shall
be
of
your
company
michelle
exclaimed
her
face
instantly
brightening
then
her
lip
curved
to
a
mocking
smile
as
she
added
what
could
we
do
without
that
elizabeth
laugh
at
her
all
you
like
said
lucy
unruffled
i
know
her
better
than
i
do
not
laugh
at
her
michelle
protested
but
to
be
friend
with
her
seems
strange
never
i
thought
to
trust
in
one
of
that
country
oh
michelle
that
s
not
quite
fair
lucy
began
but
her
arguments
died
away
on
her
lips
she
had
no
right
to
lecture
michelle
who
had
seen
the
worst
and
would
be
more
than
human
if
the
name
of
german
were
not
hateful
to
her
you
ll
know
before
long
that
elizabeth
can
be
trusted
she
contented
herself
with
saying
oh
yes
answered
michelle
unconvinced
but
anxious
to
make
amends
for
her
frankness
you
will
come
then
lucy
i
will
wait
for
the
eagerness
in
her
eyes
made
lucy
respond
quickly
i
certainly
will
i
may
be
late
but
that
can
t
be
helped
i
m
never
sure
when
elizabeth
can
get
then
and
thank
you
smiled
michelle
stopping
on
her
way
down
the
hall
to
carry
a
handful
of
wet
clay
to
the
american
cowboy
artist
he
in
turn
presented
her
with
a
clay
buffalo
quite
lifelike
with
its
lowered
head
and
threatening
horns
only
mind
you
don
t
break
off
the
horns
he
cautioned
i
d
a
given
that
little
mamzel
a
fair
treat
if
i
hadn
t
been
skeered
to
try
it
he
confided
to
lucy
after
michelle
s
departure
i
wanted
to
make
her
a
little
boche
head
pig
eyes
and
one
of
our
boys
getting
a
good
swipe
at
him
with
a
bayonet
i
ll
do
it
hush
said
lucy
laughing
but
glancing
apprehensively
around
you
mustn
t
talk
about
boches
so
loud
at
the
end
of
another
hour
she
went
off
duty
in
the
hall
to
help
elizabeth
bring
in
the
nurses
supper
at
the
first
opportunity
she
explained
the
promise
made
michelle
you
ll
take
me
with
you
won
t
you
elizabeth
she
asked
anxiously
oh
yes
miss
lucy
i
think
so
in
the
morning
i
stop
to
bring
you
back
after
i
get
the
basket
full
from
the
little
farm
only
elizabeth
added
looking
earnestly
into
lucy
s
face
promise
me
you
don
t
by
yourself
to
the
old
prison
i
you
ll
take
me
there
soon
again
said
lucy
thinking
sadly
that
the
little
stock
of
provisions
she
had
left
captain
beattie
must
be
already
gone
i
hope
you
can
leave
early
elizabeth
she
said
returning
to
the
evening
s
plan
if
you
can
t
miss
pearse
will
make
such
a
she
was
happy
at
the
chance
of
doing
michelle
a
service
as
well
as
at
the
prospect
of
seeing
her
friend
for
longer
than
a
hurried
hour
elizabeth
was
more
sympathetic
this
time
too
than
when
lucy
had
proposed
the
other
expedition
elizabeth
did
not
encourage
patriotism
or
daring
on
lucy
s
part
and
if
she
had
had
her
way
would
have
kept
her
in
safe
seclusion
she
did
her
best
to
get
through
her
long
day
s
work
early
and
it
was
not
yet
ten
o
clock
when
she
left
lucy
at
the
side
door
of
michelle
s
house
lucy
was
instantly
admitted
and
her
hostess
gave
her
a
warm
welcome
i
thought
perhaps
you
do
not
come
and
i
feel
so
sorry
said
michelle
smiling
with
pleasure
as
she
took
lucy
s
cape
from
her
shoulders
maman
is
asleep
and
clemence
working
in
the
kitchen
because
she
stayed
with
maman
while
i
was
at
the
hospital
you
know
we
give
the
breakfast
every
morning
to
the
german
sentinel
on
this
you
do
cried
lucy
indignantly
yes
we
must
come
and
sit
here
by
the
candle
said
michelle
leading
the
way
into
the
little
parlor
and
show
me
what
gave
you
the
english
you
said
that
i
should
see
of
course
i
m
going
to
leave
it
here
with
you
anyway
it
s
the
first
chance
i
ve
michelle
glanced
keenly
toward
the
windows
across
which
calico
curtains
were
drawn
as
lucy
raised
the
hem
of
her
dress
and
ripping
a
few
stitches
drew
out
a
folded
slip
of
paper
the
two
girls
sat
down
at
the
table
on
which
the
flickering
candle
burned
and
lucy
spread
the
paper
out
before
them
i
ve
hardly
done
more
than
peek
at
it
myself
she
remarked
you
ve
made
me
so
cautious
michelle
i
don
t
do
anything
without
stopping
to
think
if
it
is
i
am
glad
of
that
said
michelle
soberly
it
is
better
you
should
be
too
careful
than
to
forget
once
that
the
boches
are
always
listening
oh
see
he
has
drawn
it
like
a
picture
that
the
danger
may
not
be
so
great
for
lucy
remembered
the
englishman
s
brief
explanation
as
she
bent
over
the
little
sketch
and
repeated
it
to
michelle
the
drawing
was
cleverly
but
roughly
made
with
quick
strokes
of
the
pen
and
to
her
eye
at
least
would
have
suggested
nothing
suspicious
beneath
it
were
scrawled
the
words
changing
the
the
six
groups
of
german
soldiers
leaning
lazily
on
their
guns
as
they
awaited
their
orders
to
relieve
the
various
might
have
been
seen
any
day
from
captain
beattie
s
prison
window
as
for
the
curving
line
of
the
road
as
he
had
drawn
it
only
an
observing
eye
would
notice
that
the
road
behind
the
prison
had
really
far
less
width
and
fewer
windings
the
sketched
in
beyond
completed
the
zigzag
outline
lucy
saw
it
all
now
with
a
rush
of
comprehension
the
carefully
measured
lines
behind
the
lounging
figures
of
the
guard
were
the
bastions
of
the
great
fortified
ridge
at
argenton
the
soldiers
were
the
hidden
batteries
whose
locations
had
been
the
object
of
such
deadly
and
ineffectual
search
oh
michelle
she
sighed
filled
with
eager
and
helpless
longing
i
d
do
get
this
over
to
our
and
i
too
exclaimed
the
french
girl
with
flashing
eyes
but
what
can
we
do
we
can
only
lucy
frowned
in
bitter
rebellion
as
she
folded
the
paper
once
more
and
slipped
it
carefully
into
her
pocket
i
must
return
to
maman
said
michelle
picking
up
the
candle
perhaps
she
is
awake
lucy
followed
her
friend
up
the
narrow
dingy
stairs
and
as
she
did
so
her
exasperation
began
to
give
place
to
a
pleasanter
and
more
helpful
feeling
she
looked
forward
to
spending
the
night
in
the
de
la
tours
little
house
though
they
were
in
enemy
hands
this
house
still
kept
some
of
the
elements
of
home
its
neat
simple
interior
and
the
united
affection
of
the
three
who
made
up
the
clemence
was
one
of
them
by
virtue
of
hardships
long
shared
in
much
to
lucy
after
her
days
in
the
crowded
hospital
and
nights
in
the
house
across
the
street
madame
de
la
tour
was
lying
awake
but
she
declared
that
her
sleep
had
made
her
feel
much
better
there
is
no
need
to
remain
up
for
me
she
said
decidedly
but
i
am
glad
you
came
she
added
taking
lucy
affectionately
by
the
hand
my
michelle
is
very
happy
to
have
your
i
wanted
to
come
it
s
lovely
to
be
in
a
real
somebody
s
home
again
said
lucy
warmly
her
eyes
filled
with
sympathy
and
pity
as
she
looked
at
the
fragile
little
figure
in
the
old
french
peasant
bed
with
clumsy
wooden
side
boards
then
try
to
have
a
good
night
s
sleep
urged
madame
de
la
tour
fixing
her
bright
eyes
on
lucy
s
face
your
checks
are
grown
thinner
than
i
like
to
see
lucy
was
glad
to
go
to
bed
in
these
surroundings
and
made
no
objection
when
michelle
led
the
way
with
a
candle
to
the
little
chamber
next
her
own
old
clemence
slept
just
now
on
a
sofa
by
her
mistress
s
side
already
down
below
they
could
hear
her
noisily
bolting
doors
and
doing
her
best
to
secure
the
broken
windows
by
fastening
the
shutters
the
two
girls
talked
a
while
together
for
their
sleepiness
was
not
quite
proof
against
the
many
things
each
wanted
to
hear
about
the
other
but
presently
michelle
stole
out
to
see
that
her
mother
wanted
nothing
and
coming
back
took
up
lucy
s
candle
and
wished
her
i
must
wake
you
very
early
in
the
morning
you
know
how
good
it
will
be
to
have
you
here
for
breakfast
she
said
with
friendly
satisfaction
as
she
went
away
for
the
first
time
in
many
nights
lucy
slept
deep
and
dreamlessly
as
though
she
were
safe
at
home
again
she
could
not
believe
the
night
was
over
when
at
the
first
peep
of
dawn
she
woke
to
find
michelle
standing
at
her
bedside
her
pretty
black
hair
tumbled
about
her
shoulders
and
her
eyes
still
heavy
with
sleep
i
am
very
sorry
i
must
call
you
from
the
bed
so
early
she
apologized
but
i
must
help
clemence
before
i
go
to
the
hospital
it
is
for
that
we
take
the
breakfast
as
soon
as
it
grows
all
right
said
lucy
yawning
and
stretching
herself
awake
before
she
added
i
have
to
be
ready
early
anyway
for
elizabeth
will
stop
for
me
at
seven
o
clock
i
ll
help
you
too
michelle
what
do
you
have
to
do
not
so
much
michelle
responded
sitting
down
for
a
moment
at
the
foot
of
lucy
s
bed
to
comb
her
hair
free
from
its
curling
tangles
i
make
a
little
coffee
for
maman
while
clemence
is
preparing
breakfast
for
the
sentinel
he
eats
well
oh
to
think
of
having
to
feed
him
exclaimed
lucy
tossing
about
in
her
indignation
sometimes
when
i
first
wake
in
the
morning
i
can
t
believe
we
really
are
in
the
german
lines
it
seems
too
awful
to
be
it
is
much
better
now
than
when
the
boches
make
their
first
capture
of
the
town
said
michelle
the
brightness
dying
out
of
her
face
with
the
words
then
there
were
many
more
regiment
they
were
proud
with
victory
and
cared
for
no
one
s
prayers
they
went
into
the
houses
stealing
all
they
found
maman
and
i
for
two
days
hid
in
the
hospital
when
the
officers
made
again
a
little
order
in
the
town
we
returned
to
poor
she
would
not
leave
the
house
rather
she
tell
us
she
will
stay
and
fight
the
boches
who
enter
but
for
all
her
scolding
they
take
away
the
little
food
we
have
and
maman
and
i
must
go
and
beg
for
bread
from
the
sergeant
at
the
for
wood
also
we
must
beg
for
the
soldiers
take
all
we
have
and
it
was
snow
upon
the
as
michelle
spoke
her
quiet
voice
became
filled
with
trembling
indignation
she
let
fall
her
hair
upon
her
shoulders
and
pressed
her
hands
together
while
her
blue
eyes
shone
with
the
bitter
resentment
reawakened
she
had
told
lucy
but
a
tenth
part
of
the
suffering
and
humiliation
of
those
days
which
far
from
being
safely
past
might
be
repeated
at
any
moment
lucy
s
indignant
sympathy
was
for
an
instant
too
strong
for
words
and
the
next
michelle
had
regained
her
rising
from
the
bed
she
exclaimed
with
a
kind
of
scornful
impatience
at
herself
it
is
no
good
to
think
of
those
bad
times
enough
that
is
bad
we
have
still
with
she
turned
to
smile
faintly
back
at
lucy
as
she
said
more
cheerfully
we
must
have
a
pleasant
breakfast
together
so
you
will
like
to
come
and
give
me
your
company
lucy
dressed
very
thoughtfully
her
mind
filled
with
the
glimpse
michelle
had
given
her
of
that
terrible
past
which
had
been
even
harder
to
endure
than
the
uncertain
present
now
lucy
better
understood
the
look
that
had
arrested
her
attention
at
first
sight
of
michelle
s
face
lucy
had
thought
that
she
herself
was
bearing
much
and
with
passable
courage
but
how
much
smaller
her
trials
seemed
when
compared
with
michelle
s
long
years
of
suffering
and
anxiety
borne
with
no
other
companion
than
her
frail
little
mother
when
she
finished
dressing
and
ran
michelle
was
already
in
the
engaged
in
setting
the
table
with
a
breakfast
of
hot
pea
soup
and
two
slices
of
coarse
black
bread
lucy
knew
it
was
the
best
the
house
afforded
and
she
felt
reluctant
to
eat
of
the
precious
little
store
but
evidently
her
company
was
worth
far
more
to
michelle
than
a
few
mouthfuls
of
food
the
french
girl
had
cheered
up
from
her
melancholy
and
greeting
lucy
with
a
bright
smile
made
place
for
her
at
the
bare
wooden
table
oh
lucy
she
exclaimed
if
only
you
had
come
to
see
me
four
years
ago
what
a
nice
breakfast
i
should
have
given
you
this
was
the
first
reference
michelle
had
ever
made
to
her
beautiful
old
home
which
was
now
a
ruin
but
perhaps
she
added
thoughtfully
you
never
would
have
come
to
france
without
this
but
after
the
war
i
ll
come
again
michelle
said
lucy
eagerly
i
don
t
think
a
friendship
begun
like
ours
can
ever
be
forgotten
france
and
america
will
never
seem
so
far
apart
as
they
did
we
won
t
think
of
france
any
more
as
a
foreign
she
looked
across
the
table
at
her
friend
for
response
to
her
sincere
enthusiasm
for
michelle
had
fallen
suddenly
silent
lucy
followed
her
eyes
in
astonishment
to
where
they
were
fixed
on
the
little
door
which
led
from
the
back
of
the
room
down
to
the
cellar
as
she
looked
closely
at
it
trying
to
discover
the
cause
of
michelle
s
motionless
attention
she
saw
that
it
was
not
quite
shut
before
she
had
time
to
think
further
she
saw
the
door
pushed
open
and
a
german
soldier
entered
the
room
the
spoon
in
lucy
s
hand
dropped
on
the
table
a
bewildered
fear
took
possession
of
her
the
soldier
was
a
tall
stalwart
blond
with
dusty
and
uniform
as
though
fresh
from
active
duty
as
he
stood
there
against
the
door
he
had
closed
behind
him
he
panted
a
little
and
his
face
seen
in
the
shadowy
light
though
young
looked
haggard
and
lined
with
weariness
this
picture
formed
itself
in
an
instant
on
her
mind
the
next
she
heard
a
trembling
cry
from
michelle
s
lips
the
soldier
pushed
off
his
little
round
cap
and
held
out
his
arms
michelle
he
said
armand
michelle
answered
in
a
voice
that
was
half
a
sob
with
one
bound
she
had
crossed
the
floor
and
thrown
her
arms
about
the
soldier
s
neck
while
over
his
tired
face
broke
a
smile
as
sweet
and
radiant
as
her
own
oh
armand
did
you
come
why
did
you
come
was
all
she
could
say
in
the
first
moment
of
her
joy
and
terror
i
had
to
come
to
learn
that
you
were
safe
he
said
unsteadily
lucy
s
heart
had
given
one
leap
and
now
it
began
racing
furiously
as
her
paralyzing
fright
changed
to
different
emotions
fear
for
michelle
s
brother
in
the
deadly
peril
in
which
he
had
placed
himself
and
a
thrill
of
admiration
at
his
daring
exploit
were
mingled
with
the
wild
delight
of
knowing
that
captain
beattie
s
paper
was
safely
in
her
pocket
ready
to
be
confided
to
the
frenchman
s
keeping
while
these
thoughts
chased
each
other
through
her
mind
michelle
turned
from
her
brother
with
blue
eyes
shining
in
her
white
frightened
face
to
say
tremblingly
in
english
oh
lucy
it
is
armand
my
friend
armand
mademoiselle
lucy
gordon
who
knows
all
we
hope
and
fear
a
brother
she
has
too
with
the
captain
de
la
tour
stretched
a
friendly
hand
to
lucy
with
a
courteous
bow
which
seemed
strange
to
her
from
a
man
in
german
uniform
he
spoke
english
without
michelle
s
difficulty
gordon
is
your
brother
lieutenant
gordon
the
aviator
then
mademoiselle
we
are
not
strangers
i
have
brought
him
news
of
how
things
are
in
for
once
since
the
capture
i
crossed
the
lines
but
could
not
manage
to
reach
this
we
have
something
to
give
that
will
help
the
allies
stammered
lucy
almost
choking
over
the
words
in
her
realization
of
success
at
last
in
sight
truly
but
first
of
all
i
must
see
maman
she
is
michelle
ill
you
say
in
bed
he
ran
to
the
stairs
while
michelle
half
mad
with
anxiety
called
clemence
from
the
kitchen
and
in
a
few
hasty
words
bade
her
watch
the
street
and
the
entrance
to
the
garden
i
ll
watch
from
the
other
side
lucy
offered
but
michelle
objected
you
can
see
better
from
above
all
should
be
well
and
if
not
we
have
no
way
to
forbid
that
they
come
in
he
will
stay
only
a
few
minutes
the
guard
is
not
changed
before
two
hours
more
so
not
till
then
will
the
sentinel
come
for
breakfast
if
only
it
did
not
grow
light
so
soon
armand
was
kneeling
by
his
mother
s
bed
questioning
her
about
her
welfare
with
feverish
eagerness
i
had
no
peace
not
knowing
that
you
were
safe
he
said
in
answer
to
his
mother
s
reproaches
made
in
an
agony
of
fear
how
could
you
think
i
would
not
come
lucy
stood
by
the
front
window
breathing
fast
her
face
flushed
and
burning
in
the
cool
morning
air
outside
the
sentry
was
lazily
pacing
he
passed
the
house
perhaps
once
in
fifteen
minutes
but
this
time
he
had
turned
toward
it
with
a
curious
glance
that
set
lucy
in
a
frenzy
of
uncertainty
he
had
not
the
look
of
suspecting
that
an
enemy
spy
was
in
the
neighborhood
but
the
house
seemed
to
interest
him
perhaps
lucy
thought
with
a
rush
of
hope
as
he
passed
on
he
was
only
longing
for
the
hour
of
relief
and
the
sausages
and
potatoes
awaiting
him
she
turned
back
to
the
room
where
armand
was
telling
of
his
entrance
into
the
town
interrupted
by
a
hundred
questions
from
his
mother
and
michelle
there
were
such
endless
things
to
be
asked
and
answered
on
both
sides
and
lucy
herself
would
have
given
much
for
a
few
words
with
him
she
was
listening
to
his
rapid
talk
following
the
french
with
an
effort
when
a
loud
knock
sounding
on
the
front
door
echoed
through
the
house
captain
de
la
tour
sprang
to
his
feet
his
body
alert
and
his
blue
eyes
flashing
michelle
seizing
his
hand
with
ashy
cheeks
and
quivering
lips
entreated
him
hide
armand
come
my
room
the
young
frenchman
gave
a
quick
shake
of
the
head
if
they
suspect
me
all
concealment
is
useless
you
forget
i
am
well
disguised
do
as
i
say
and
nothing
more
go
down
michelle
and
do
not
deny
a
german
soldier
is
he
listened
intently
as
michelle
silently
obeyed
him
his
mother
white
and
motionless
waited
likewise
for
signs
of
what
was
taking
place
below
clemence
had
admitted
some
one
and
now
they
heard
her
voice
protesting
and
a
man
s
voice
short
and
surly
in
reply
then
michelle
interposed
calm
and
conciliating
steps
crossed
the
floor
of
the
hall
toward
the
stairway
there
was
no
time
for
any
plan
lucy
thought
wildly
but
in
the
moment
that
clemence
preceded
the
intruder
up
the
stairs
captain
de
la
tour
had
drawn
from
his
gray
tunic
a
and
pencil
and
standing
by
his
mother
s
bedside
began
jotting
down
notes
with
a
steady
hand
clemence
and
terrified
ran
into
the
room
her
hands
wound
frenziedly
about
her
apron
after
her
came
the
german
sentry
a
frown
on
his
heavy
face
and
curiosity
lighting
up
his
eyes
at
sight
of
the
occupants
of
the
room
he
made
the
suggestion
of
a
bow
but
he
offered
no
apology
for
his
intrusion
as
fingering
his
gun
he
stared
at
armand
s
tall
commanding
figure
illustration
what
s
your
business
here
hello
mate
said
armand
in
german
looking
quietly
up
from
his
as
michelle
followed
the
soldier
into
the
room
lucy
could
not
restrain
a
gasp
of
amazement
at
the
scene
before
her
she
knew
michelle
s
wonderful
and
did
not
so
much
marvel
at
her
hastily
assumed
look
of
angry
annoyance
unmixed
with
the
least
sign
of
her
mortal
anxiety
but
to
see
delicate
little
madame
de
la
tour
lying
back
on
her
pillows
with
an
expression
of
cold
exasperation
her
eyes
glancing
from
armand
to
the
sentry
saying
plainly
that
one
german
soldier
had
been
quite
enough
without
another
forcing
himself
upon
her
was
such
a
wonderful
change
from
her
helpless
terror
of
a
moment
past
that
lucy
could
hardly
believe
her
eyes
even
the
german
sentry
looked
uncomfortable
before
the
little
french
lady
s
calm
and
silent
dignity
he
shuffled
his
feet
awkwardly
as
he
answered
with
a
nod
at
armand
hello
you
a
stranger
what
s
your
business
here
because
i
m
a
stranger
to
you
doesn
t
mean
i
m
one
to
the
whole
town
returned
armand
with
a
twitch
at
the
corner
of
his
mouth
as
though
hiding
a
smile
at
his
own
wit
then
in
a
more
friendly
tone
he
added
however
i
ve
no
objection
to
telling
you
my
business
i
m
detailed
from
the
third
regiment
up
the
line
to
help
here
in
the
supply
depot
they
re
making
a
new
list
of
the
population
the
food
s
not
holding
i
know
that
well
enough
grumbled
the
sentry
his
inquisitive
look
changing
to
one
of
gloomy
dissatisfaction
much
good
you
can
do
about
now
suppose
you
tell
me
what
you
are
doing
here
suggested
armand
with
a
return
of
his
faintly
mocking
tone
the
sentry
leaned
on
his
gun
a
little
sheepishly
as
he
answered
i
m
supposed
to
keep
an
eye
on
who
goes
in
and
out
along
this
he
did
not
care
to
confess
the
real
motive
for
his
precipitate
entrance
seeing
a
fellow
soldier
enter
the
garden
path
and
disappear
in
the
shrubbery
he
had
been
seized
with
a
greedy
suspicion
that
the
newcomer
had
designs
on
his
breakfast
a
chance
shortening
of
his
usual
beat
had
given
him
this
glimpse
of
armand
and
he
had
shortened
it
once
more
to
enter
the
house
after
lucy
had
watched
him
pass
to
change
the
subject
he
inquired
amicably
the
third
did
you
say
you
belonged
to
that
s
in
the
trenches
now
isn
t
it
how
did
you
get
off
two
days
only
said
armand
without
enthusiasm
i
m
on
sick
leave
light
work
they
call
he
closed
his
and
slipped
it
back
inside
his
tunic
well
are
you
ready
to
go
asked
the
sentry
restored
to
good
humor
i
d
like
some
company
as
far
as
the
end
of
my
beat
i
suppose
you
re
not
going
nearer
the
meadows
than
this
there
s
no
one
living
no
i
m
starting
back
now
said
armand
he
turned
toward
the
bed
where
madame
de
la
tour
lay
and
giving
a
slight
stiff
bow
murmured
the
sentry
moved
by
force
of
example
made
a
faint
bow
likewise
and
followed
his
companion
to
the
stairs
motionless
and
silent
armand
s
mother
and
sister
watched
him
go
they
heard
him
engaged
in
friendly
conversation
with
the
german
in
the
hall
below
where
armand
paused
to
get
his
cap
from
the
the
next
minute
the
door
slammed
behind
the
sentry
s
heavy
hand
and
their
footsteps
sounded
on
the
stone
flags
outside
lucy
and
michelle
with
one
accord
rushed
to
the
window
armand
and
the
sentry
were
walking
slowly
down
the
street
with
another
few
steps
a
projecting
wall
hid
them
from
sight
michelle
was
shaking
from
head
to
foot
and
the
hand
that
touched
lucy
s
was
icy
cold
but
she
overcame
herself
enough
to
return
with
clemence
to
her
mother
s
side
and
give
poor
madame
de
la
tour
the
comfort
of
her
presence
at
that
moment
lucy
had
not
their
awful
anguish
of
fear
to
endure
it
was
not
her
brother
who
walked
the
streets
of
in
imminent
danger
of
recognition
and
certain
death
but
she
was
almost
as
wretched
as
they
in
the
bitterness
of
her
disappointment
she
felt
an
unreasoning
confidence
that
captain
de
la
tour
would
manage
to
reach
the
allied
lines
in
safety
his
nerve
and
coolness
were
powerful
weapons
among
the
german
soldiery
but
he
would
return
without
the
slip
of
paper
which
she
had
dared
so
much
to
obtain
and
which
might
have
brought
safety
and
freedom
to
them
all
twice
i
ve
failed
she
thought
as
with
choking
throat
and
eyes
blurred
with
tears
she
sank
miserably
down
on
the
little
oh
it
seems
as
though
any
one
could
have
done
better
than
i
before
the
occupants
of
the
room
had
collected
their
stunned
and
bewildered
thoughts
a
second
knock
sounded
on
the
front
door
this
time
a
gentler
one
that
s
elizabeth
exclaimed
lucy
starting
to
her
feet
and
winking
the
tears
from
her
eyes
at
the
same
moment
an
idea
occurred
to
her
at
sight
of
michelle
s
white
face
and
madame
de
la
tour
s
pitiful
struggle
for
hope
and
courage
michelle
i
ll
ask
elizabeth
to
find
out
about
your
brother
to
learn
where
he
goes
and
if
he
gets
safely
away
she
can
go
among
the
soldiers
and
ask
them
any
questions
without
being
no
no
i
beg
you
cried
michelle
suddenly
restored
to
speech
and
movement
never
could
i
trust
her
with
armand
s
secret
her
blue
eyes
had
lighted
up
with
that
dread
and
terror
of
every
german
lucy
opened
her
lips
to
say
frankly
that
her
doubts
were
absurd
and
that
now
if
ever
was
a
time
when
elizabeth
could
be
of
service
and
could
relieve
the
agony
of
madame
de
la
tour
s
mind
but
unwilling
to
argue
the
subject
before
michelle
s
mother
she
drew
her
friend
toward
the
stairway
instead
saying
come
down
with
me
while
i
let
elizabeth
in
i
want
to
speak
to
michelle
agreed
but
as
they
descended
the
stairs
she
forestalled
lucy
by
repeating
earnestly
you
must
not
tell
the
german
woman
of
my
brother
enough
enemies
he
has
her
voice
broke
as
she
ended
the
deadly
fear
at
her
heart
overwhelming
her
once
more
lucy
had
reached
the
lower
floor
and
stood
staring
into
the
uncertain
what
to
say
or
do
for
elizabeth
receiving
no
answer
to
her
knocks
had
become
anxious
for
lucy
and
had
entered
the
house
left
unlocked
since
armand
s
departure
she
stood
there
within
a
few
feet
of
them
and
the
day
was
bright
enough
for
lucy
to
see
by
her
face
that
she
had
heard
michelle
s
words
michelle
gave
a
gasp
herself
but
elizabeth
did
not
wait
for
either
one
to
speak
you
need
not
fear
me
mademoiselle
she
said
quietly
and
lucy
thought
she
had
never
seen
in
that
little
figure
so
much
proud
dignity
i
am
not
among
the
enemies
of
your
brudder
since
for
france
i
suppose
he
fights
when
i
tell
miss
lucy
i
am
it
is
that
i
am
changed
in
heart
and
only
in
my
tongue
better
you
trust
me
and
that
we
together
work
for
else
it
is
little
good
that
i
can
for
a
moment
michelle
was
silent
for
the
struggle
in
her
mind
was
too
intense
for
words
but
at
the
end
of
that
short
pause
she
spoke
and
the
hatred
and
suspicion
had
left
her
voice
grief
and
anxiety
alone
remained
as
she
said
falteringly
i
will
trust
you
elizabeth
you
must
forgive
me
that
i
could
not
before
i
think
i
do
so
truly
only
time
will
show
you
that
i
am
true
replied
elizabeth
still
with
a
little
hurt
accent
in
her
voice
as
though
she
felt
michelle
s
conversation
was
not
yet
complete
it
is
not
for
love
of
france
that
i
have
turned
against
my
country
it
is
for
love
of
michelle
said
lucy
breaking
in
fearful
the
new
alliance
would
not
withstand
an
argument
and
wildly
anxious
to
make
use
of
elizabeth
s
help
i
m
going
now
ll
do
all
i
can
you
trust
me
she
put
her
arms
around
michelle
s
neck
with
all
the
warmth
of
her
sympathy
and
understanding
and
looked
into
her
face
in
her
eyes
she
read
unwilling
consent
and
no
further
objection
came
from
her
lips
i
m
going
to
tell
her
lucy
whispered
absolving
herself
from
her
promise
i
ll
come
again
as
soon
as
i
possibly
the
next
moment
she
and
elizabeth
were
outside
in
the
street
walking
silently
back
in
the
direction
of
the
hospital
lucy
gave
a
keen
glance
about
her
and
seeing
only
ruined
desolation
on
both
sides
quickly
began
telling
elizabeth
the
story
of
armand
s
coming
and
of
the
miserable
that
had
prevented
the
delivery
of
captain
beattie
s
message
elizabeth
what
michelle
didn
t
want
to
tell
you
was
that
her
brother
is
making
his
way
out
of
the
town
now
can
t
you
discover
for
us
whether
he
gets
safely
out
they
are
in
such
awful
i
will
try
miss
lucy
elizabeth
promised
tell
me
how
he
looks
and
to
what
regiment
he
pretends
that
he
lucy
gave
all
the
details
she
was
able
and
as
she
spoke
the
realization
of
her
failure
came
over
her
again
in
a
bitter
flood
of
disappointment
oh
elizabeth
she
groaned
feeling
a
desperate
need
of
her
old
nurse
s
comforting
affection
to
think
i
should
have
such
a
chance
and
miss
it
a
chance
we
can
never
hope
will
come
elizabeth
could
not
see
lucy
unhappy
and
remain
unmoved
her
dark
eyes
tenderly
softened
as
she
said
with
a
vain
attempt
at
the
consolation
beyond
her
power
to
give
ach
dear
miss
lucy
be
not
so
sad
long
ago
when
i
was
a
child
there
comes
to
our
house
a
so
kind
old
man
the
friend
of
my
father
when
any
of
us
children
wished
long
for
something
he
would
say
remember
the
proverb
many
times
your
cake
may
to
coal
turn
but
the
last
time
come
fair
from
the
i
don
t
want
to
hear
your
old
german
proverbs
were
the
words
that
rose
angrily
to
lucy
s
tongue
but
she
kept
them
back
instead
after
a
little
silence
she
said
very
thoughtfully
a
resolution
as
yet
vague
and
uncertain
waking
to
life
behind
her
words
i
think
the
best
proverb
is
one
that
an
american
made
up
if
you
want
a
thing
done
do
it
chapter
xii
gordon
and
bob
hour
after
gordon
received
news
that
bob
was
wounded
she
had
turned
over
her
little
flock
of
orphans
to
a
s
charge
and
was
on
her
way
to
cantigny
her
companion
had
almost
more
work
of
her
own
than
she
could
manage
in
spite
of
her
cheerful
willingness
to
accept
the
added
responsibility
gordon
felt
at
imposing
the
task
upon
her
but
nothing
at
that
moment
could
keep
her
from
her
son
if
she
must
walk
every
step
of
the
way
to
reach
him
the
telegram
was
scarcely
a
reassuring
one
it
said
wounded
degree
undetermined
and
it
had
taken
hours
to
come
the
short
distance
at
the
moment
that
she
set
out
however
fortune
favored
her
a
big
loaded
with
stores
was
crawling
along
the
village
street
and
a
officer
to
whom
she
had
already
appealed
for
transportation
crossed
the
street
at
sight
of
her
saying
here
s
your
chance
gordon
i
m
so
glad
we
can
manage
this
lorry
is
going
to
cantigny
and
will
be
faster
traveling
than
the
railroad
i
can
t
offer
you
anything
but
a
seat
with
the
gordon
thanked
him
from
the
depths
of
her
heart
in
a
few
hurried
words
as
he
stopped
the
lorry
and
helped
her
to
a
place
beside
the
soldier
at
the
wheel
make
as
good
time
as
you
can
adams
he
said
no
short
cuts
though
keep
well
out
of
it
was
only
fifteen
miles
to
cantigny
directly
northeast
but
the
necessary
détours
made
the
real
distance
nearer
the
road
was
full
of
holes
and
cut
up
into
ruts
by
the
heavy
traffic
to
and
from
the
front
on
every
side
the
ruin
and
desolation
of
blackened
fields
and
woodland
overpowered
the
beauty
of
the
springtime
still
struggling
to
show
itself
in
nooks
and
corners
that
had
escaped
the
cannon
the
soldier
at
gordon
s
side
a
lanky
new
englander
withdrew
his
eyes
from
the
road
occasionally
to
look
at
his
passenger
with
pity
and
a
kind
of
troubled
helplessness
in
his
glance
gordon
had
begun
preparing
for
her
journey
immediately
after
reading
the
telegram
she
had
not
yielded
to
a
moment
s
weakness
or
inaction
but
had
gone
methodically
through
the
details
of
turning
over
her
charges
and
getting
herself
ready
it
was
a
hot
sultry
morning
and
in
her
preoccupation
she
did
not
realize
how
hard
she
worked
in
the
hour
before
leaving
now
seated
in
the
lorry
with
two
hours
at
least
of
waiting
before
her
her
courage
seemed
all
at
once
to
give
way
and
the
dreadful
suspense
she
must
endure
became
unbearable
her
vivid
imagination
saw
bob
seriously
wounded
perhaps
dying
and
wondering
why
she
did
not
come
the
sight
tormented
her
so
that
she
sank
her
face
into
her
hands
welcoming
the
hard
jolting
of
the
heavy
vehicle
as
at
least
a
momentary
distraction
from
her
suffering
her
husband
had
been
given
back
to
her
and
could
she
hope
that
bob
would
be
spared
too
then
remembering
lucy
she
unreasonably
hoped
again
surely
lucy
s
captivity
was
enough
to
bear
and
nothing
further
would
be
asked
of
her
just
now
i
got
a
little
cold
water
here
ma
am
said
the
soldier
breaking
the
sound
of
the
laboring
motor
with
an
embarrassed
cough
this
dust
is
sure
the
gordon
looked
up
at
him
and
read
the
sympathy
in
his
eyes
he
held
out
to
her
a
full
canteen
and
she
took
it
gratefully
for
the
had
dried
her
throat
in
the
first
half
hour
of
travel
the
dust
stuck
to
her
face
and
hands
too
and
powdered
her
clothing
but
she
hardly
noticed
it
she
unscrewed
the
canteen
and
poured
a
little
of
the
water
into
her
mouth
it
was
cool
and
refreshing
and
as
she
swallowed
it
she
tried
hard
to
get
back
a
little
courage
and
calmness
she
had
by
nature
plenty
of
both
and
in
a
moment
handing
back
the
canteen
to
the
soldier
with
a
word
of
thanks
she
clasped
her
hands
in
her
lap
and
looked
about
her
she
could
not
tell
how
far
they
had
come
for
the
landscape
was
much
the
same
except
that
a
church
tower
with
its
belfry
shot
away
rose
now
from
the
woody
distance
when
do
you
think
we
shall
get
to
cantigny
she
asked
longingly
well
was
the
thoughtful
answer
sometimes
i
make
it
in
two
hours
but
that
ain
t
often
i
ll
do
the
best
i
can
ma
am
we
ll
be
there
by
noon
sure
it
s
not
but
ten
he
glanced
at
the
pale
face
beside
him
and
at
the
delicate
hands
clasped
so
tightly
together
and
added
diffidently
don
t
feel
so
bad
ma
am
the
lieutenant
is
a
strong
young
feller
he
ll
come
out
right
do
you
know
him
asked
gordon
surprised
sure
i
do
i
took
over
this
bus
full
of
stuff
for
the
aero
field
only
last
week
lieutenant
gordon
checked
off
my
list
and
when
he
got
through
he
nodded
to
me
and
says
good
work
adams
you
really
brought
everything
you
were
supposed
to
how
did
it
happen
i
had
to
laugh
at
that
ma
am
because
the
truth
was
i
did
forget
a
bundle
of
wire
and
the
sergeant
called
me
back
for
bob
s
mother
tried
to
smile
at
the
soldier
s
story
though
the
remembrance
of
bob
s
health
and
cheerfulness
was
small
comfort
now
but
she
had
controlled
herself
dreading
to
become
ill
and
useless
at
the
end
of
her
journey
if
she
yielded
longer
to
her
fears
she
straightened
up
resolutely
against
the
hard
seat
and
in
a
moment
answered
the
man
s
kindly
encouragement
by
saying
oh
i
have
good
hope
that
he
is
not
seriously
wounded
what
part
of
the
united
states
are
you
from
adams
where
is
your
home
it
was
hard
to
interest
herself
in
the
account
the
yankee
willingly
poured
forth
but
nevertheless
she
managed
it
in
return
the
time
passed
more
quickly
for
her
and
her
nerves
grew
steadier
it
was
about
a
quarter
past
twelve
when
at
last
they
entered
cantigny
it
seemed
a
whole
day
to
gordon
that
she
had
sat
enveloped
in
the
dust
of
that
endless
road
but
on
the
whole
the
journey
had
been
a
quick
one
she
turned
to
the
soldier
with
brief
thanks
and
farewell
as
they
drew
up
at
the
steps
of
the
house
made
into
a
hospital
an
officer
appeared
in
the
doorway
and
gordon
summoning
all
her
reserves
of
courage
in
case
she
should
have
to
hear
the
worst
asked
hurriedly
lieutenant
gordon
captain
how
is
he
i
am
his
she
never
afterward
forgot
the
smile
with
which
the
surgeon
promptly
answered
you
may
stop
worrying
right
now
gordon
your
son
had
a
bullet
through
his
shoulder
muscle
but
what
s
that
to
a
strong
young
man
not
until
that
moment
did
gordon
realize
the
dread
she
had
endured
now
that
the
fear
was
lifted
from
her
heart
she
leaned
weakly
against
the
doorway
tears
blinding
her
eyes
and
hardly
knew
that
the
surgeon
had
taken
her
arm
and
was
urging
her
to
follow
him
but
the
next
minute
she
was
herself
again
strengthened
by
her
longing
to
see
with
her
own
eyes
that
bob
was
safe
the
surgeon
led
her
into
a
room
made
into
a
ward
which
could
accommodate
about
twenty
wounded
officers
he
had
no
need
to
point
bob
out
to
his
mother
in
a
second
she
was
beside
him
he
was
leaning
against
his
pillows
with
one
arm
and
shoulder
closely
bandaged
but
his
face
was
not
pale
nor
his
bright
smile
changed
as
he
cried
out
at
sight
of
her
mother
i
knew
you
d
come
oh
i
m
afraid
you
ve
been
dreadfully
gordon
could
hardly
speak
but
her
eyes
told
her
that
bob
was
safe
and
the
touch
of
his
cool
strong
fingers
swept
her
last
fears
away
near
by
on
a
cot
half
hidden
by
a
screen
lay
a
young
man
tossing
about
and
muttering
to
himself
his
face
was
flushed
and
a
wide
bandage
was
wrapped
about
his
head
from
which
the
brown
hair
had
been
cut
away
gordon
turned
back
to
bob
with
unspeakable
thankfulness
in
her
heart
i
knew
you
d
be
worried
he
said
with
a
frown
of
anger
at
sight
of
his
mother
s
pale
face
i
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
off
the
telegram
for
fear
you
would
hear
the
news
some
other
way
that
i
bungled
things
the
obstinate
old
sergeant
here
copied
the
message
right
off
the
card
they
pinned
on
me
at
the
before
they
examined
my
wound
i
told
him
to
say
slightly
wounded
but
nothing
could
make
him
change
never
mind
bob
dear
i
know
now
that
you
are
all
right
smiled
gordon
sinking
down
on
the
little
chair
beside
the
cot
with
a
sigh
of
peaceful
weariness
her
face
and
hands
were
grimy
with
dust
but
she
did
not
think
yet
of
her
discomfort
tell
me
all
about
it
it
happened
she
begged
they
let
you
talk
don
t
they
yes
indeed
they
let
me
do
anything
but
shrug
my
shoulders
and
i
don
t
particularly
want
to
do
happy
in
his
mother
s
presence
and
in
the
knowledge
that
she
was
freed
from
anxiety
about
him
bob
began
telling
the
story
of
the
fight
in
which
he
was
wounded
a
quarter
of
an
hour
passed
quickly
while
gordon
listened
with
fascinated
interest
too
proud
of
bob
s
skill
and
daring
to
wish
him
more
prudent
but
sadly
fearful
for
the
future
in
the
midst
of
her
satisfaction
his
account
was
cut
short
by
the
sound
of
a
footstep
at
the
door
of
the
ward
bob
paused
to
look
up
then
forgot
his
story
as
he
called
out
with
a
welcoming
smile
come
on
in
harding
here
she
is
at
while
he
spoke
a
young
infantry
captain
with
a
bandaged
hand
crossed
the
room
holding
out
his
sound
left
hand
to
gordon
a
frank
merry
smile
that
no
hardships
had
yet
robbed
him
of
lighted
up
his
face
at
the
pleasure
of
the
meeting
mrs
gordon
he
exclaimed
i
glad
to
see
dick
you
here
too
cried
gordon
starting
to
her
feet
he
took
her
hand
and
looking
earnestly
into
her
tired
face
the
smile
faded
from
his
lips
and
he
said
remorsefully
if
i
d
only
known
in
time
i
d
have
gone
to
you
myself
with
the
news
of
bob
s
wound
and
saved
you
all
this
worry
i
m
convalescent
and
could
have
got
gordon
patted
the
young
officer
s
shoulder
looking
at
him
with
friendly
affection
i
know
you
would
have
dick
thank
you
for
thinking
of
it
but
tell
me
what
you
re
doing
here
you
ve
been
wounded
again
her
eyes
shrank
a
little
from
the
sight
of
his
bandaged
hand
for
dick
harding
s
first
wound
had
been
a
serious
affair
and
well
remembered
by
the
gordons
for
it
was
coincident
with
bob
s
capture
and
imprisonment
he
held
up
his
hand
to
show
her
saying
reassuringly
it
s
nothing
this
a
bullet
wound
fingers
are
all
right
sit
down
and
tell
me
about
a
shadow
stole
over
his
face
and
his
eyes
saddened
as
he
added
don
t
talk
about
lucy
if
you
don
t
feel
like
it
but
i
ve
thought
of
her
so
much
i
can
t
think
of
anything
gordon
s
eyes
filled
with
sudden
tears
at
his
words
his
grief
and
sympathy
were
so
sincere
and
real
that
the
little
he
said
meant
much
to
her
he
had
suffered
with
them
during
lucy
s
captivity
and
she
and
bob
had
no
secrets
from
him
i
have
nothing
to
tell
you
dear
dick
she
said
unsteadily
the
news
bob
brought
is
the
last
we
as
she
spoke
her
thoughts
went
back
a
year
to
governor
s
island
to
lucy
s
and
this
young
officer
s
pleasant
friendship
how
long
it
seemed
since
the
july
morning
that
lucy
had
waked
her
to
tell
her
that
dick
s
regiment
had
gone
i
can
t
help
hoping
for
the
best
captain
harding
was
saying
when
she
listened
to
him
again
it
seems
so
wonderful
that
the
colonel
has
recovered
and
that
lucy
has
found
that
precious
old
elizabeth
to
watch
over
her
with
such
good
luck
i
keep
looking
for
more
and
do
you
know
i
m
almost
sure
it
will
it
was
faint
enough
consolation
but
somehow
it
cheered
gordon
a
little
she
smiled
at
the
young
officer
thanking
him
in
her
heart
for
his
determined
optimism
at
the
same
moment
a
nurse
came
up
to
offer
her
a
cup
of
tea
and
a
chance
to
wash
her
dusty
face
and
hands
beginning
to
realize
her
appearance
she
gladly
accepted
leaving
captain
harding
at
bob
s
side
for
a
few
minutes
dick
said
bob
thoughtfully
after
his
mother
had
left
the
two
alone
i
m
going
to
tell
her
my
scheme
it
s
only
your
plan
to
bring
lucy
out
asked
captain
harding
ruffling
his
hair
with
a
nervous
hand
while
the
troubled
anxious
look
returned
to
his
face
it
impossible
no
i
won
t
be
a
he
added
quickly
as
bob
frowned
at
him
i
don
t
blame
you
for
attempting
the
impossible
it
s
beyond
endurance
to
leave
her
there
and
we
don
t
seem
much
nearer
to
recapturing
the
it
s
a
question
of
getting
some
of
the
information
we
need
or
of
waiting
for
reinforcements
for
a
mass
attack
along
this
front
i
wait
any
longer
without
trying
something
mother
is
worrying
herself
sick
if
i
landed
once
behind
why
can
t
i
do
it
again
and
even
recross
the
german
lines
in
safety
with
help
from
you
fellows
on
this
side
may
i
join
you
comrades
asked
captain
jourdin
s
voice
from
a
few
steps
away
the
frenchman
had
paused
on
his
way
across
the
ward
for
bob
s
invitation
which
was
not
slow
in
coming
you
re
just
the
person
we
wish
to
see
bob
exclaimed
reaching
out
a
hand
to
his
friend
in
warm
welcome
it
was
bully
of
you
to
come
over
no
flights
this
morning
there
s
another
chair
for
you
dick
he
added
to
captain
harding
who
had
yielded
his
own
seat
to
the
aviator
yes
but
i
came
down
again
early
things
are
quiet
along
the
line
since
last
night
what
is
your
discussion
if
i
may
know
it
s
about
trying
to
bring
lucy
out
of
now
don
t
shake
your
head
and
say
it
s
a
difficult
undertaking
i
know
that
well
enough
but
i
m
going
to
try
then
it
is
not
my
advice
you
wish
but
my
assistance
remarked
the
frenchman
tell
me
your
plan
and
i
promise
you
all
the
help
in
my
power
i
will
lead
a
guarding
squadron
to
keep
off
enemy
that
what
you
wish
just
exactly
said
bob
with
enthusiasm
i
don
t
see
why
it
can
t
be
done
anyway
once
over
their
lines
i
ll
know
if
i
can
bring
her
safely
back
lucy
could
crouch
down
in
the
observer
s
seat
so
as
to
be
almost
entirely
and
you
harding
asked
captain
jourdin
you
will
direct
your
battery
that
will
be
ticklish
work
at
night
but
you
can
keep
the
boches
wary
and
unwilling
to
fly
once
they
are
up
you
can
not
do
i
can
scare
them
off
a
part
of
the
for
bob
to
make
a
safe
crossing
our
trenches
are
very
near
theirs
at
that
point
i
ll
need
of
course
with
luck
we
might
even
find
a
night
when
they
did
not
fly
they
seem
decidedly
short
of
scouts
around
they
have
massed
them
at
but
it
seems
to
me
you
are
two
wounded
men
how
are
you
to
accomplish
all
this
inquired
captain
jourdin
in
the
puzzled
tone
of
a
man
who
thought
the
adventure
more
gallant
than
feasible
before
his
mind
s
eye
came
some
of
the
many
and
had
seen
fall
to
death
bob
s
chance
of
safety
was
no
more
than
theirs
and
lucy
must
helplessly
share
his
danger
i
ll
be
up
in
a
surgeon
said
so
bob
insisted
and
harding
is
all
right
now
he
expects
they
will
let
him
out
in
three
captain
jourdin
rose
quickly
at
sight
of
gordon
who
was
just
reëntering
the
ward
your
mother
has
come
gordon
he
said
with
keen
surprise
and
pleasure
she
knows
of
your
may
talk
of
it
no
but
i
will
tell
her
right
now
said
bob
i
certainly
can
t
try
it
without
her
jourdin
had
met
bob
s
mother
in
governor
s
island
days
and
now
in
the
midst
of
common
fears
and
perils
they
seemed
rather
friends
than
acquaintances
gordon
greeted
him
warmly
as
she
joined
the
little
group
looking
herself
again
with
the
dust
quite
got
rid
of
what
were
you
saying
bob
she
asked
smiling
at
her
son
from
whom
she
could
hardly
take
her
eyes
bob
told
his
plan
without
delay
and
gordon
paling
a
little
listened
in
silence
until
he
had
finished
she
no
longer
felt
as
she
would
have
a
few
months
ago
at
hearing
such
a
proposal
she
had
endured
so
much
and
had
seen
such
terrific
obstacles
overcome
by
skill
and
daring
that
she
hesitated
to
call
any
feat
impossible
it
was
dreadful
to
her
to
think
of
lucy
s
share
in
such
a
desperate
venture
but
no
more
dreadful
than
what
she
was
bearing
every
day
in
the
knowledge
of
her
captivity
what
can
i
say
she
asked
her
voice
shaking
a
little
it
seems
a
mad
attempt
but
if
there
a
good
she
turned
to
the
frenchman
fancying
that
his
willingness
to
help
bob
outran
his
confidence
of
success
would
you
have
proposed
this
yourself
captain
jourdin
she
said
earnestly
you
have
had
more
experience
than
it
seem
too
foolhardy
to
you
jourdin
considered
a
moment
his
fine
candid
face
grave
and
thoughtful
we
have
first
of
all
to
make
known
our
coming
to
mademoiselle
he
said
at
last
successful
in
that
i
shall
be
eager
to
go
on
if
the
firing
is
heavy
we
must
come
back
without
her
that
is
captain
harding
stirred
in
his
chair
frowning
as
he
inquired
doubtfully
how
about
the
old
man
i
can
t
see
him
allowing
his
squadron
to
go
off
like
that
on
private
major
kitteredge
thus
referred
to
did
seem
a
and
for
a
moment
bob
could
find
no
reply
oh
well
he
can
only
refuse
he
said
finally
i
ll
ask
him
he
s
coming
to
see
me
anyway
gordon
it
is
a
very
indefinite
plan
yet
said
captain
harding
thinking
bob
s
mother
had
endured
enough
anxiety
for
one
day
nothing
can
be
settled
until
bob
is
well
and
you
know
how
many
things
may
happen
before
then
may
even
be
here
the
conversation
ended
for
so
many
uncertainties
entered
into
the
project
it
was
hard
to
talk
it
over
gordon
had
only
that
day
to
remain
with
bob
and
the
other
two
officers
rose
to
leave
her
alone
with
him
early
on
the
following
day
gordon
returned
to
her
duty
and
soon
afterward
bob
had
his
conversation
with
major
kitteredge
his
superior
officer
had
been
very
kind
about
paying
him
short
visits
and
the
old
friendship
between
them
would
ordinarily
have
made
bob
speak
boldly
but
this
time
caution
urged
him
to
be
wary
he
had
narrowly
escaped
disaster
the
night
he
returned
from
and
he
doubted
much
that
his
chief
would
sanction
a
second
visit
there
or
would
believe
in
its
possible
success
he
broached
the
subject
nearest
his
heart
by
idly
remarking
funny
isn
t
it
major
how
different
the
discipline
of
the
aviation
corps
is
from
that
of
the
other
arms
of
the
service
i
mean
every
man
is
more
or
less
on
his
can
carry
out
his
plan
once
he
is
in
the
air
without
consulting
you
mean
he
can
obey
orders
in
whatever
way
he
thinks
best
major
kitteredge
corrected
he
is
always
following
out
a
plan
from
headquarters
though
it
may
be
a
vague
one
he
can
t
for
instance
sail
off
and
drop
bombs
on
frankfort
if
he
has
been
told
to
harass
the
enemy
troops
at
both
are
praiseworthy
bob
was
silent
a
moment
yes
of
course
he
assented
but
if
an
aviator
asked
permission
to
make
a
certain
flight
over
enemy
territory
his
superior
would
probably
consent
wouldn
t
he
for
instance
asked
major
kitteredge
looking
keenly
at
him
well
i
know
a
fellow
who
is
anxious
to
cross
the
boche
lines
near
here
for
reasons
of
his
own
a
risky
flight
as
it
happens
but
worth
it
to
him
i
wonder
if
he
can
get
reasons
of
his
own
you
mean
he
chooses
to
take
great
risks
on
a
flight
of
no
military
value
no
his
commander
ought
to
refuse
him
leave
said
major
kitteredge
frankly
but
if
the
flight
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
later
bob
persisted
the
elder
officer
still
kept
his
eyes
on
his
companion
it
was
fairly
plain
that
he
guessed
who
the
fellow
was
of
whom
bob
spoke
watching
his
chief
s
face
bob
oddly
remembered
an
incident
of
long
ago
in
the
west
at
fort
leavenworth
when
he
had
watched
that
same
face
with
equal
anxiety
bob
had
coaxed
the
driver
of
the
ambulance
which
took
the
post
children
to
school
to
let
him
drive
the
four
frisky
mules
neither
he
nor
the
soldier
had
counted
on
passing
lieutenant
kitteredge
on
the
lonely
road
just
outside
the
reservation
how
bob
had
hoped
that
morning
that
the
young
officer
would
not
raise
his
eyes
to
the
driver
s
seat
and
notice
this
serious
breach
of
orders
bob
had
already
been
punished
once
for
it
it
seemed
impossible
that
the
lieutenant
should
not
see
him
and
he
scorned
to
hand
over
the
reins
at
the
last
second
even
if
it
could
have
been
done
in
safety
the
officer
slightly
turned
his
head
and
cast
a
glance
in
their
direction
then
he
looked
straight
up
the
road
again
as
the
ambulance
rolled
swiftly
by
bob
s
boyish
heart
had
warmed
with
gratitude
for
that
friendly
blindness
he
pulled
up
the
mules
handed
the
reins
back
to
the
driver
without
a
word
and
climbed
over
to
his
own
place
it
was
his
eager
study
of
major
kitteredge
s
face
now
that
brought
this
little
scene
so
vividly
back
would
he
be
generous
once
more
in
this
new
favor
that
bob
sought
and
ignore
what
he
could
not
approve
so
you
want
to
go
into
again
and
bring
lucy
out
was
the
surprising
answer
he
received
after
a
long
moment
to
bob
s
how
did
you
guess
it
look
major
kitteredge
added
smiling
you
re
a
great
conspirator
then
grown
serious
again
he
said
slowly
it
s
a
hard
question
to
answer
i
hesitate
as
much
on
lucy
s
account
as
for
other
reasons
she
must
share
all
the
but
if
mother
bob
put
in
eagerly
at
any
rate
you
can
do
nothing
until
you
are
fit
for
duty
declared
major
kitteredge
you
know
how
useless
it
is
to
plan
a
week
ahead
wait
until
you
are
well
and
then
we
ll
talk
about
bob
was
willing
to
change
the
subject
for
a
while
he
stretched
his
injured
shoulder
carefully
to
try
its
strength
another
week
and
i
ll
be
back
on
duty
major
it
s
tough
waiting
all
this
time
i
m
so
afraid
we
ll
commence
a
push
and
i
shan
t
be
there
after
hoping
so
long
for
bob
believed
that
a
week
would
see
him
back
at
work
but
the
surgeon
thought
differently
and
it
was
ten
days
after
gordon
s
departure
when
he
returned
to
duty
his
desire
to
get
on
with
the
plan
for
lucy
s
rescue
had
only
increased
with
the
delay
and
now
he
was
determined
to
make
at
least
a
beginning
major
kitteredge
could
not
object
to
his
communicating
with
his
sister
and
arranging
some
signal
which
should
announce
their
coming
when
the
attempt
was
made
it
was
a
beautiful
morning
with
a
sky
ideal
for
his
flight
over
the
firing
along
the
line
was
light
and
scattered
he
could
surely
hang
over
the
meadows
in
and
out
of
the
veiling
clouds
with
a
fair
chance
of
discovering
elizabeth
on
her
daily
round
it
was
still
early
enough
to
meet
her
on
her
morning
trip
across
the
fields
he
had
a
bundle
of
papers
containing
s
latest
speech
beside
him
on
the
farmhouse
floor
one
copy
he
had
spread
against
a
book
on
his
knee
and
was
carefully
pricking
it
full
of
holes
that
you
jourdin
he
called
out
hearing
a
footfall
outside
the
door
yes
was
the
answer
as
the
frenchman
entered
the
room
with
his
quick
light
step
good
come
and
help
me
with
this
message
will
you
i
want
to
say
as
much
as
possible
in
a
few
words
so
elizabeth
can
read
it
quickly
see
what
you
think
of
he
held
the
sheet
of
paper
to
the
light
and
was
about
to
decipher
it
when
jourdin
laying
a
hand
upon
his
shoulder
interrupted
him
i
am
very
sorry
bob
he
said
we
can
not
think
of
this
now
i
came
to
tell
you
that
we
must
go
up
at
once
the
boches
are
out
in
force
over
montdidier
and
half
our
little
squadron
has
engaged
them
they
need
help
before
he
finished
speaking
bob
had
sprung
to
his
feet
the
german
airplanes
were
always
thick
around
montdidier
he
knew
what
straits
the
americans
must
be
in
if
they
had
encountered
a
full
squadron
of
their
fokkers
i
ll
be
with
you
in
two
minutes
he
said
i
ve
been
feeling
ever
since
i
got
up
that
something
was
going
to
happen
but
i
couldn
t
tell
what
blessings
on
my
shoulder
for
getting
well
just
in
chapter
xiii
the
price
of
victory
members
of
the
squadron
had
remained
in
cantigny
and
these
now
took
to
the
biplanes
and
four
light
monoplanes
both
bob
and
jourdin
were
in
this
time
little
craft
in
which
the
pilot
must
trust
to
speed
and
dexterity
of
handling
for
his
defense
bob
s
heart
beat
high
with
hope
and
confidence
as
he
rose
from
the
field
into
the
bright
morning
air
they
were
pointed
south
for
montdidier
and
in
ten
minutes
flight
the
monoplanes
had
outstripped
their
heavier
comrades
bob
carefully
examined
his
guns
and
everything
within
reach
in
the
cockpit
his
little
plane
was
flying
beautifully
the
rhythmic
pulse
of
the
engine
told
him
all
was
in
perfect
order
and
a
world
of
glorious
opportunity
opened
again
before
him
the
last
days
in
the
hospital
had
filled
him
with
restless
longing
his
efforts
in
lucy
s
behalf
were
for
the
time
being
thwarted
and
for
that
very
reason
he
must
put
in
good
work
against
the
boches
jourdin
flew
right
ahead
of
him
and
larry
eaton
was
in
a
third
monoplane
at
his
side
in
twenty
minutes
they
had
neared
montdidier
and
above
the
hot
fire
from
the
german
trenches
there
came
swiftly
into
view
the
battle
in
the
air
bob
had
taken
part
in
several
fierce
engagements
and
had
grown
familiar
with
the
wild
thrill
that
comes
with
plunging
into
conflict
at
thousands
of
feet
above
the
earth
but
as
the
little
reinforcing
squadron
drew
nearer
to
the
city
he
realized
that
this
fight
was
the
greatest
he
had
ever
seen
the
air
was
so
filled
with
planes
whirling
hither
and
thither
in
furious
attack
or
swift
retreat
and
the
noise
of
the
nearest
propellers
made
such
a
volume
of
sound
that
he
could
make
but
a
vague
guess
at
the
numbers
engaged
gathered
together
into
squadrons
or
pursuing
each
one
his
enemy
independently
the
airplanes
were
fighting
in
and
out
among
the
clouds
above
the
whole
of
montdidier
and
far
beyond
the
city
bob
s
thoughts
got
no
further
than
this
in
his
momentary
confusion
when
from
a
group
a
few
hundred
yards
in
front
a
german
albatross
scout
darted
toward
him
he
needed
no
more
than
this
to
restore
his
coolness
and
determination
he
saw
the
black
crosses
on
the
little
plane
s
silvery
wings
and
the
wide
muzzle
of
the
machine
gun
into
which
the
german
was
fitting
a
belt
of
ammunition
his
own
gun
was
already
loaded
the
two
weapons
crashed
out
together
the
bullets
spattering
over
both
moving
targets
then
each
swooped
lightly
out
of
range
to
maneuver
again
for
the
advantage
bob
s
tactics
were
different
now
when
no
heavy
metal
body
protected
him
his
nieuport
could
not
withstand
the
hail
of
bullets
that
jourdin
s
had
received
in
the
fight
above
argenton
and
to
use
his
guns
he
must
swing
his
whole
machine
into
range
he
glanced
quickly
over
the
cockpit
and
saw
that
the
fire
from
the
trenches
was
too
distant
to
be
dangerous
he
was
flying
at
just
nine
thousand
feet
the
next
instant
his
enemy
came
up
from
below
him
trying
for
a
shot
at
the
tail
of
his
machine
bob
dropped
in
a
spin
then
paused
to
discharge
a
stream
of
bullets
on
the
german
s
flank
his
enemy
dodged
but
failed
to
return
the
fire
bob
guessed
why
his
gun
was
jammed
the
german
ran
away
northward
bob
following
the
two
machines
were
fairly
matched
in
speed
another
german
scenting
danger
for
his
comrade
in
the
escaping
plane
made
northward
too
a
third
plane
followed
and
as
bob
turned
his
head
to
see
if
this
last
were
friend
or
foe
the
pilot
s
hand
was
raised
in
greeting
and
larry
eaton
signaled
with
a
quick
gesture
that
the
second
german
was
his
quarry
bob
nodded
agreement
and
putting
on
speed
flew
after
his
retreating
foe
he
was
soon
making
a
hundred
miles
an
hour
and
the
summer
air
thin
and
cold
at
this
height
cut
sharply
against
his
face
and
made
welcome
the
protection
of
his
leather
coat
and
helmet
the
german
was
speeding
too
in
spite
of
having
to
clean
and
reload
his
guns
in
another
moment
he
dived
so
suddenly
that
bob
flashed
right
over
the
spot
where
he
had
been
as
his
enemy
mounted
in
a
climbing
turn
directly
underneath
bob
passed
too
swiftly
to
receive
a
close
hit
but
the
german
managed
to
deliver
a
broadside
which
cut
holes
in
bob
s
left
plane
and
sent
bullets
whizzing
against
the
cockpit
and
about
his
head
now
bob
was
in
front
his
enemy
following
not
liking
this
new
arrangement
bob
himself
dived
circled
up
at
terrific
speed
and
fired
a
burst
at
his
pursuer
as
the
latter
was
grasping
his
stick
for
a
plunge
for
a
second
bob
thought
he
had
downed
his
foe
for
the
german
plane
wavered
and
one
wing
tilted
as
though
the
shots
had
fatally
injured
it
but
the
next
moment
the
plane
righted
itself
the
sudden
turn
the
pilot
made
in
seeking
to
escape
the
broadside
had
caused
his
machine
to
veer
to
one
side
the
wing
was
cut
by
bullets
but
not
more
than
bob
s
own
before
bob
could
bring
his
gun
to
bear
again
upon
his
shaken
enemy
the
german
darted
upward
at
lightning
speed
and
vanished
in
a
soft
white
cloud
bob
hovered
reloaded
his
guns
and
picking
up
his
binoculars
looked
around
for
larry
and
the
antagonist
he
had
pursued
how
had
jourdin
ever
managed
he
wondered
to
send
down
the
enemy
planes
the
famous
ace
had
to
his
credit
it
seemed
to
bob
sometimes
as
though
the
winged
fighters
were
almost
invincible
his
best
efforts
when
he
flew
alone
were
usually
rewarded
by
seeing
his
enemy
elude
him
uninjured
a
cloud
lay
right
beneath
him
but
as
he
peered
down
searching
for
the
other
planes
it
floated
by
leaving
a
clear
view
of
the
distant
earth
below
to
bob
s
astonishment
he
discovered
that
he
was
over
there
off
to
his
right
were
the
wide
meadows
so
familiar
to
his
eyes
directly
beneath
was
the
town
itself
looking
on
the
side
nearest
the
meadows
but
growing
less
damaged
toward
the
centre
his
surprise
once
over
at
the
distance
he
had
covered
from
montdidier
his
feeling
was
one
of
keen
regret
his
father
and
lucy
would
see
the
fight
above
their
heads
and
suffer
all
the
pain
of
suspense
and
uncertainty
their
conquerors
would
give
them
no
news
of
the
battle
unless
they
could
announce
a
german
victory
for
as
these
thoughts
flashed
through
bob
s
mind
he
saw
that
this
minor
fight
was
growing
into
a
battle
from
the
cloud
beneath
him
darted
up
two
german
planes
after
one
of
which
larry
eaton
s
nieuport
with
its
red
white
and
blue
emblems
closely
followed
the
other
german
was
engaged
in
a
duel
with
a
second
american
plane
which
now
appeared
behind
it
and
their
loops
and
spirals
left
bob
at
a
loss
for
the
moment
to
see
which
had
the
advantage
his
hand
was
on
his
control
to
fly
to
larry
s
aid
for
the
foe
at
that
instant
had
turned
upon
his
pursuer
but
some
good
fortune
prompting
him
to
glance
upward
bob
saw
his
old
enemy
descending
on
him
from
the
shelter
of
the
the
german
opened
fire
and
bob
made
a
climbing
turn
to
elude
him
before
attempting
any
offensive
from
his
height
of
some
fifty
feet
above
his
antagonist
he
saw
the
german
copying
his
tactics
and
rising
swiftly
to
get
into
range
bob
planned
a
little
stratagem
he
wanted
above
all
things
to
get
rid
of
this
pursuer
for
with
the
tail
of
his
eye
he
saw
that
the
fighters
below
were
engaged
in
deadly
struggle
as
the
german
rose
above
him
bob
hovered
uncertainly
firing
at
his
enemy
from
an
ineffectual
distance
while
the
latter
contemptuous
of
these
scattering
bullets
flew
nearer
on
a
higher
level
and
prepared
to
pounce
bob
left
off
firing
gave
a
swift
touch
to
his
responsive
motor
and
rose
like
lightning
to
the
other
side
of
his
adversary
the
german
snatched
at
his
port
machine
gun
but
in
that
second
bob
s
deadly
broadside
had
riddled
his
left
wing
and
torn
the
fabric
to
rags
the
wire
supports
cut
loose
left
the
wing
sagging
and
powerless
bob
was
so
close
he
saw
the
pilot
s
look
of
furious
despair
he
saw
too
that
even
at
this
moment
when
his
machine
wavered
to
fall
the
german
s
hand
was
on
his
trigger
bob
dropped
in
a
as
the
gun
crashed
out
a
hundred
feet
down
he
paused
hovering
and
glanced
over
the
cockpit
his
enemy
s
descent
had
been
quicker
than
his
he
saw
the
helpless
german
machine
fall
to
earth
among
the
streets
of
the
next
moment
he
had
darted
to
the
aid
of
the
three
allied
planes
who
were
now
engaged
by
six
germans
three
of
these
last
had
risen
from
the
trenches
in
front
of
bob
saw
with
joy
that
jourdin
was
fighting
near
larry
eaton
s
side
the
second
american
was
a
veteran
of
the
lafayette
squadron
we
have
a
good
chance
bob
thought
with
rising
confidence
at
the
same
time
he
saw
the
face
of
the
german
pilot
who
was
gracefully
maneuvering
his
monoplane
for
a
shot
on
jourdin
s
flank
von
arnheim
bob
sent
his
plane
speeding
forward
his
determination
roused
as
never
before
his
eyes
on
the
german
s
every
movement
as
von
arnheim
sought
with
incredible
nimbleness
to
throw
jourdin
off
his
guard
meanwhile
in
the
friends
of
the
allies
were
watching
the
fight
with
desperate
interest
the
planes
were
too
high
to
be
clearly
seen
without
glasses
and
every
pair
of
french
or
american
binoculars
had
been
confiscated
colonel
gordon
s
eagerness
had
led
him
out
into
the
garden
his
longest
walk
since
his
illness
and
lucy
glanced
anxiously
at
his
pale
face
from
time
to
time
as
side
by
side
they
watched
the
distant
planes
dart
back
and
forth
against
the
bright
blue
sky
it
was
torment
to
see
the
fighters
swift
movements
without
being
able
to
distinguish
friend
from
enemy
or
even
to
guess
at
the
progress
of
the
battle
when
bob
s
antagonist
fell
lucy
hid
her
eyes
in
horror
and
dismay
she
clung
to
her
father
s
arm
in
panting
silence
for
words
were
useless
he
knew
no
more
than
she
whether
it
was
ally
or
german
or
even
bob
himself
who
had
fallen
the
little
group
gathered
around
them
shifted
back
and
forth
in
hopeless
efforts
to
get
a
better
sight
of
the
combatants
only
the
german
officers
at
headquarters
knew
who
was
winning
and
they
were
not
likely
to
send
any
news
of
a
reassuring
sort
to
the
american
hospital
at
lucy
s
entreaty
elizabeth
had
gone
on
a
vain
search
for
information
vain
at
least
so
far
as
getting
any
accurate
news
was
concerned
for
elizabeth
dared
not
question
any
one
higher
in
rank
than
a
officer
and
these
were
not
supplied
with
glasses
and
knew
scarcely
more
than
she
the
little
crowd
in
the
square
among
which
she
paused
was
alive
with
excited
speculation
animated
or
cast
down
each
moment
by
alternate
hopes
and
fears
hopes
and
fears
this
time
for
most
of
the
crowd
at
least
the
noisiest
part
of
it
was
made
up
of
german
soldiers
all
those
off
duty
or
convalescent
at
the
hospitals
were
there
and
elizabeth
soon
found
an
acquaintance
sergeant
vogel
she
said
politely
to
a
burly
german
who
stood
staring
upward
at
her
side
we
are
winning
likely
enough
i
suppose
i
can
t
tell
though
from
the
sergeant
looked
down
from
the
sky
with
a
short
laugh
to
be
sure
you
can
t
frau
no
more
can
i
all
i
know
is
that
one
of
the
birds
fell
just
now
i
hope
with
all
my
heart
it
brought
a
yankee
where
did
it
fall
asked
elizabeth
cold
with
apprehension
bob
s
smiling
young
face
flashed
before
her
eyes
and
it
was
hard
for
her
to
listen
calmly
to
the
sergeant
s
reply
off
toward
the
eastern
part
of
the
town
it
was
some
enemy
be
sure
of
that
i
can
guess
at
the
shape
of
our
planes
well
enough
to
see
that
we
far
outnumber
elizabeth
dared
not
show
her
agitation
nor
continue
her
inquiries
only
a
few
days
past
she
had
questioned
this
same
man
about
the
german
soldier
who
was
armand
de
la
tour
until
he
wondered
at
her
idle
curiosity
she
had
learned
that
michelle
s
brother
succeeded
in
getting
away
undiscovered
but
her
unusual
inquisitiveness
had
excited
some
surprise
while
she
hesitated
now
whether
to
go
off
by
herself
and
try
to
stumble
on
some
news
or
to
return
to
console
lucy
as
best
she
could
a
soldier
came
up
and
murmured
something
in
sergeant
vogel
s
ear
the
message
was
not
a
welcome
one
the
german
s
eyebrows
and
mustaches
bristled
in
an
angry
frown
his
face
flushed
red
and
his
jaw
closed
sharply
all
the
had
left
his
face
but
elizabeth
hazarded
a
timid
question
what
is
it
sergeant
may
i
hear
the
news
no
snapped
the
german
can
t
you
bottle
up
your
curiosity
for
a
moment
am
i
to
answer
your
questions
all
day
elizabeth
guessed
that
he
was
only
venting
his
on
the
nearest
object
and
waited
unresentfully
in
silence
the
sergeant
raised
his
eyes
again
to
the
sky
where
the
airplanes
still
swooped
and
circled
and
the
frown
and
flush
gradually
left
his
face
in
a
moment
elizabeth
spoke
gently
once
more
i
should
be
so
much
obliged
to
you
sergeant
for
a
little
news
one
good
turn
deserves
another
don
t
you
remember
how
often
i
supplied
you
the
best
bread
and
sausage
from
my
nephew
s
shop
you
and
karl
were
pretty
good
cronies
the
german
laughed
his
short
laugh
again
the
recollections
elizabeth
called
up
were
pleasant
ones
well
well
frau
i
see
there
s
no
peace
until
i
tell
he
stooped
close
to
her
ear
and
spoke
in
a
gruff
whisper
it
was
a
german
plane
that
fell
the
pilot
was
killed
keep
your
mouth
shut
now
he
added
sharply
i
tell
you
a
bit
of
news
for
friendship
s
sake
but
it
s
not
the
sort
to
spread
about
our
men
are
none
too
cheerful
lately
as
it
is
a
lot
of
grumbling
dogs
elizabeth
sadly
shook
her
head
with
a
look
of
silent
grief
and
disappointment
it
was
not
all
affected
either
for
beneath
her
genuine
joy
that
the
unfortunate
pilot
was
not
bob
and
that
she
could
bring
relief
to
lucy
s
anxiety
her
heart
ached
at
the
death
of
her
young
countryman
with
all
her
honest
soul
elizabeth
longed
for
the
kaiser
s
bloody
tyranny
to
be
overthrown
but
sometimes
she
wondered
despairingly
if
there
would
be
any
germans
left
to
enjoy
the
blessings
of
peace
eager
to
return
to
lucy
she
made
her
way
quickly
through
the
crowd
and
across
the
square
to
the
hospital
garden
lucy
and
her
father
were
still
standing
there
gazing
up
at
the
sky
colonel
gordon
rested
his
arm
against
the
broken
gatepost
but
weary
as
he
was
neither
lucy
nor
major
greyson
could
persuade
him
to
go
in
elizabeth
went
up
to
them
and
as
lucy
s
anxious
eyes
met
hers
she
said
in
her
soft
quick
voice
it
was
not
bob
who
fell
dear
miss
any
her
voice
sank
still
lower
as
she
added
a
german
it
was
but
nothing
say
of
it
to
any
the
two
faces
before
her
lighted
as
though
a
cloud
were
lifted
from
them
oh
elizabeth
thank
you
breathed
lucy
from
the
depths
of
her
grateful
heart
i
knew
you
her
words
broke
off
in
a
quick
gasp
roused
by
the
stir
about
her
she
had
again
glanced
upward
another
airplane
was
falling
to
the
earth
whirling
down
through
the
clear
air
on
one
helpless
broken
wing
the
battle
had
begun
to
shift
south
again
toward
cantigny
but
in
the
hot
fighting
of
the
past
few
minutes
bob
failed
to
notice
that
they
were
no
longer
directly
above
jourdin
had
sent
down
one
of
his
antagonists
and
bob
tried
hard
to
do
as
much
for
von
arnheim
but
without
success
jourdin
still
eluding
him
the
german
turned
all
his
attention
to
the
young
american
never
until
that
moment
had
bob
fully
realized
von
arnheim
s
skill
and
coolness
his
own
movements
as
they
had
seemed
before
became
suddenly
slow
and
clumsy
while
a
swift
and
deadly
fire
enveloped
him
from
the
enemy
swooping
and
dodging
alongside
he
himself
dodged
fell
in
a
then
rose
again
vainly
seeking
to
throw
von
arnheim
off
or
get
him
within
range
the
stream
of
bullets
from
his
own
machine
gun
scarcely
touched
the
little
plane
that
circled
like
a
gnat
around
him
never
an
instant
still
bob
s
heart
began
to
pound
in
his
ears
and
his
cool
brain
grew
furious
and
desperate
unable
to
endure
the
galling
fire
which
was
cutting
his
wings
and
beating
against
the
body
of
his
plane
he
determined
to
risk
a
rush
at
his
pursuer
suddenly
the
nose
of
a
monoplane
shot
up
in
front
of
him
as
bob
s
tense
fingers
felt
for
the
trigger
of
his
second
gun
the
stranger
pilot
gave
a
shout
and
larry
eaton
s
eyes
looked
into
his
never
was
help
more
welcome
bob
s
courage
soared
again
and
while
larry
pumped
bullets
on
von
arnheim
s
flank
bob
climbed
swiftly
and
once
above
his
enemy
at
last
turned
an
effective
fire
upon
him
von
arnheim
dodged
in
a
graceful
circle
turning
this
time
upon
larry
with
undiminished
vigor
bob
saw
that
his
friend
was
no
more
able
than
himself
to
withstand
these
tactics
he
shot
downward
to
larry
s
help
and
diving
between
the
two
planes
delivered
a
heavy
burst
of
fire
on
von
arnheim
s
right
just
as
the
german
had
got
into
range
to
make
an
end
of
his
new
adversary
larry
s
blue
eyes
flashed
acknowledgment
to
bob
as
von
arnheim
staggered
for
the
moment
sank
in
a
seeking
a
chance
to
reload
bob
did
not
follow
him
with
frantic
haste
he
reloaded
both
his
guns
feeling
cautiously
of
his
left
wrist
where
a
bullet
had
grazed
it
a
german
fokker
had
swooped
down
upon
larry
and
bob
after
one
quick
glance
about
him
at
the
airplanes
darting
in
and
out
among
the
light
clouds
made
for
the
new
enemy
s
left
a
german
albatross
scout
was
flying
toward
larry
on
the
other
side
and
bob
thought
to
engage
the
fokker
himself
and
give
larry
a
chance
for
a
fair
fight
with
the
newcomer
at
that
instant
he
heard
the
familiar
crackling
of
fire
directly
above
and
looking
up
saw
von
arnheim
coming
down
upon
him
he
dropped
his
spin
becoming
a
spiral
dive
that
sent
him
down
a
thousand
feet
but
still
the
german
followed
bob
darted
to
one
side
and
rose
at
top
speed
looking
for
the
friendly
shelter
of
a
cloud
there
was
none
near
enough
to
give
him
a
moment
s
respite
as
he
maneuvered
his
starboard
gun
into
range
resolved
to
retreat
no
longer
von
arnheim
rushing
upon
him
from
a
slightly
higher
level
drew
his
pistol
and
leveled
it
at
bob
s
head
in
that
breath
of
time
a
monoplane
swooping
like
a
hawk
from
above
came
between
von
arnheim
and
his
prey
with
a
mastery
equal
to
the
german
s
own
jourdin
s
fire
struck
von
arnheim
full
on
the
to
withstand
he
dropped
like
a
plummet
avoiding
new
attack
by
a
zigzag
fall
as
bob
and
jourdin
closely
followed
the
three
were
almost
on
a
level
jourdin
glanced
keenly
in
bob
s
direction
for
bob
s
left
wing
was
badly
riddled
at
that
instant
von
arnheim
quick
as
a
flash
of
light
leaned
forward
and
discharged
his
pistol
at
the
frenchman
s
breast
bob
did
not
know
that
he
cried
out
overcome
with
grief
and
horror
he
saw
jourdin
fall
helplessly
against
his
gun
the
little
monoplane
abandoned
by
its
pilot
reeled
and
tilted
bob
flung
his
arm
up
to
shut
out
the
sight
but
at
the
sound
of
a
propeller
near
at
hand
he
raised
his
head
and
looked
dizzily
about
him
with
one
hand
he
felt
blindly
for
his
trigger
jourdin
had
fallen
and
close
to
bob
von
arnheim
was
circling
into
range
the
light
of
triumph
in
his
eyes
bob
s
troubled
glance
had
hardly
rested
on
his
enemy
when
larry
eaton
stealing
up
from
below
opened
a
burst
of
fire
upon
von
arnheim
s
rear
in
that
instant
without
larry
s
interference
bob
would
have
unresistingly
met
jourdin
s
fate
but
as
the
german
turned
on
his
new
aggressor
the
despair
that
had
held
bob
paralyzed
gave
way
before
a
new
emotion
never
in
his
life
had
he
felt
anything
like
the
spirit
of
indomitable
purpose
that
surged
now
within
him
his
face
grew
hard
and
pale
his
eyes
flashed
like
von
arnheim
s
own
and
with
a
swift
light
touch
on
his
control
stick
he
flew
after
larry
in
the
german
s
wake
one
thing
bob
was
sure
of
he
would
send
von
arnheim
down
or
fall
himself
both
of
them
could
not
survive
this
battle
he
thought
coolly
and
quickly
now
every
sense
on
guard
as
he
stole
up
behind
his
enemy
the
german
was
beating
off
larry
s
pursuit
with
steady
firing
larry
would
try
to
rush
closer
in
another
moment
bob
thought
planning
how
to
take
his
friend
s
place
in
the
duel
for
larry
s
plane
was
not
flying
well
it
veered
too
much
at
a
turn
of
the
rudder
and
bob
looked
at
the
wings
to
see
if
they
were
badly
torn
as
he
looked
larry
s
plane
began
to
sway
and
the
propeller
s
speed
slackened
engine
trouble
bob
guessed
now
and
gave
a
shout
of
warning
the
next
moment
the
engine
stopped
dead
and
larry
abandoning
his
attack
was
forced
to
volplane
down
as
best
he
could
for
a
landing
von
arnheim
followed
firing
at
the
helpless
plane
in
its
swift
descent
but
before
he
had
dived
a
hundred
feet
bob
was
beside
him
all
sense
of
his
own
danger
had
vanished
as
completely
as
though
he
were
invulnerable
to
von
arnheim
s
skill
with
careful
aim
he
fired
full
at
the
body
of
the
german
plane
it
quivered
and
tilted
while
von
arnheim
oblivious
to
his
damaged
left
wing
returned
the
attack
by
a
withering
blast
of
fire
the
bullets
sprayed
bob
s
little
monoplane
his
riddled
right
wing
began
to
bend
and
sag
the
instruments
on
the
board
in
front
of
him
were
smashed
to
atoms
von
arnheim
had
dodged
again
and
was
behind
him
bob
flashed
a
glance
at
his
own
wings
and
thought
he
could
risk
one
loop
without
lessening
his
speed
he
turned
completely
over
and
darting
up
behind
von
arnheim
in
a
swift
and
skilful
maneuver
discharged
his
port
gun
from
a
distance
of
a
few
yards
on
the
right
wing
and
rudder
with
a
throb
of
glorious
triumph
he
saw
the
german
plane
pitch
forward
unable
to
recover
it
fluttered
a
moment
vainly
struggling
for
life
then
plunged
down
toward
the
green
fields
below
bob
leaned
out
and
watched
it
crash
against
the
earth
then
panting
a
little
he
rubbed
one
hand
across
his
forehead
and
looked
about
him
he
had
left
the
other
fighters
behind
no
new
enemy
threatened
him
and
fortunately
for
his
plane
would
hardly
answer
the
rudder
the
right
wing
was
a
mass
of
flying
ribbons
and
the
cockpit
was
dented
and
hammered
in
by
countless
bullets
even
protected
by
its
metal
sides
he
could
not
think
how
he
had
escaped
unhurt
one
hand
was
bleeding
but
the
wound
was
only
a
trifle
he
began
cautiously
flying
down
fearing
to
put
his
damaged
wings
to
the
pressure
of
high
speed
his
one
thought
now
was
to
reach
jourdin
s
side
he
might
have
fallen
in
some
lonely
spot
where
no
one
would
come
to
him
by
the
look
of
the
country
beneath
him
bob
guessed
that
he
was
somewhere
near
cantigny
he
picked
out
a
level
bit
of
ground
and
glided
safely
to
the
grass
as
he
landed
he
caught
sight
of
a
fallen
airplane
in
an
adjoining
field
a
little
group
of
four
or
five
men
were
gathered
about
it
von
arnheim
bob
thought
not
realizing
that
his
course
had
been
confined
to
a
small
circle
in
the
past
few
moments
he
climbed
out
and
began
running
toward
the
group
in
search
of
information
passing
through
a
line
of
poplars
he
came
upon
larry
eaton
s
plane
resting
at
the
edge
of
the
field
the
next
minute
larry
himself
left
the
others
and
came
toward
him
bob
looked
again
at
the
wrecked
monoplane
beyond
and
saw
that
it
was
jourdin
s
larry
slowly
nodded
in
answer
to
bob
s
sad
questioning
glance
he
s
dead
bob
he
was
dead
before
he
fell
he
had
no
other
injury
when
they
lifted
him
in
silence
bob
drew
near
and
stood
by
the
body
of
his
friend
where
it
lay
upon
the
grass
they
had
taken
off
his
helmet
and
jourdin
s
fine
face
looked
calm
and
peaceful
in
its
utter
repose
the
officers
and
mechanicians
gathered
about
him
gave
tribute
of
their
grief
in
downcast
looks
and
gloomy
silence
at
bob
s
approach
a
flash
of
satisfaction
lighted
their
eyes
for
the
swift
retribution
he
had
meted
to
von
arnheim
the
officer
beside
him
murmured
some
words
of
congratulation
and
sympathy
but
bob
could
only
nod
in
answer
he
was
not
ashamed
of
the
tears
that
rushed
to
his
eyes
as
he
knelt
bareheaded
at
jourdin
s
side
he
thought
of
the
fight
above
argenton
and
of
the
words
that
had
come
to
his
mind
that
day
as
jourdin
stood
looking
at
the
ruined
countryside
we
may
go
under
but
not
in
not
in
vain
while
america
was
free
and
had
men
left
to
fight
at
that
moment
as
never
before
bob
felt
his
consecration
to
the
cause
that
he
upheld
jourdin
s
faith
and
deathless
courage
became
part
of
him
as
he
rose
unsteadily
to
his
feet
larry
eaton
flung
an
arm
about
his
shoulders
and
drew
him
a
little
to
one
side
you
re
wounded
bob
he
said
anxiously
let
me
it
s
nothing
said
bob
showing
the
hand
he
had
concealed
in
his
i
don
t
even
feel
it
s
bleeding
all
the
same
i
ll
tie
it
up
for
under
larry
s
commonplace
words
bob
felt
such
genuine
friendly
sympathy
that
he
was
dumbly
grateful
larry
was
just
a
boy
like
himself
who
had
left
yale
to
join
the
army
when
bob
had
left
west
point
their
thoughts
and
feelings
had
much
in
common
he
held
out
his
hand
and
let
his
companion
dress
the
slight
wound
that
caused
the
bleeding
von
he
dead
too
he
asked
presently
where
did
he
come
down
on
the
other
side
of
that
little
slope
he
was
killed
by
the
fall
bob
you
did
a
wonderful
day
s
work
think
what
von
arnheim
s
loss
means
we
paid
dearly
enough
for
it
said
bob
sombrely
on
the
day
following
the
battle
captain
jourdin
was
buried
behind
cantigny
in
a
part
of
his
picardy
that
the
boches
had
never
reached
officers
men
and
townspeople
followed
the
body
covered
with
the
tricolor
his
brother
aviators
flew
overhead
along
his
path
and
every
honor
that
love
and
homage
could
devise
was
paid
him
at
almost
the
same
hour
the
body
of
von
arnheim
received
honorable
burial
within
the
allied
lines
above
his
grave
were
fired
the
three
volleys
which
are
the
privilege
of
every
soldier
under
major
kitteredge
s
directions
larry
eaton
flew
over
the
german
lines
and
dropped
a
message
announcing
their
ace
s
death
it
was
the
of
june
one
month
after
the
capture
of
chapter
xiv
a
desperate
resolve
the
air
battle
shifted
south
again
toward
cantigny
lucy
and
her
father
were
left
in
a
state
of
dreadful
uncertainty
neither
on
that
day
nor
the
next
did
they
learn
the
result
of
the
fight
except
for
the
vague
rumors
that
went
constantly
from
mouth
to
mouth
among
the
friends
of
the
allies
these
felt
some
hope
that
the
germans
had
met
defeat
because
of
the
complete
silence
their
conquerors
kept
on
the
subject
german
victories
were
usually
loudly
proclaimed
before
them
but
there
was
talk
of
heavy
french
and
american
losses
and
this
depressing
news
was
all
that
elizabeth
could
learn
for
lucy
unable
longer
to
bear
the
continual
sight
of
the
german
officers
and
men
in
authority
at
the
hospital
lucy
sought
out
michelle
the
afternoon
of
the
day
after
the
battle
michelle
i
can
t
stand
it
any
longer
she
told
her
friend
in
the
privacy
of
the
de
la
tours
little
house
her
calmness
and
patience
had
all
at
once
fallen
from
her
michelle
looked
at
her
flushed
cheeks
and
eyes
and
exclaimed
frightened
at
the
change
in
her
but
can
you
do
no
good
comes
from
fear
and
anger
i
know
that
well
we
can
do
nothing
but
wait
and
i
wait
and
i
hope
any
longer
i
m
not
like
you
all
the
time
my
courage
comes
in
spurts
and
when
it
goes
i
am
a
coward
the
one
thing
i
can
not
stand
is
waiting
michelle
was
silent
but
her
expressive
face
said
as
plainly
as
words
that
lucy
might
have
to
bear
longer
than
a
month
what
she
herself
had
borne
four
years
yes
i
know
what
you
think
michelle
cried
lucy
reading
her
mind
it
s
you
who
should
be
desperate
not
i
but
it
was
watching
the
fight
yesterday
that
finished
me
before
that
i
still
had
a
little
courage
you
brother
michelle
asked
softly
yes
not
knowing
he
is
safe
or
who
won
the
battle
like
father
i
m
getting
so
i
can
t
sleep
or
eat
or
do
anything
but
wonder
why
on
earth
the
americans
haven
t
tried
to
push
i
know
michelle
agreed
with
instant
sympathy
but
they
will
lucy
it
seems
bright
to
us
now
who
remember
the
black
days
before
america
was
with
but
michelle
major
greyson
and
the
others
who
can
get
near
the
german
lines
think
the
allies
are
going
to
attack
you
know
how
the
firing
has
recommenced
toward
montdidier
the
last
two
days
last
night
a
regiment
marched
through
on
its
way
south
i
m
sure
the
germans
expect
i
hope
they
will
wait
for
it
at
the
wrong
place
said
michelle
sighing
but
they
are
very
hard
to
i
know
captain
beattie
s
plan
of
the
batteries
isn
t
everything
lucy
went
on
earnestly
but
he
and
bob
are
so
sure
that
argenton
is
the
key
to
an
advance
along
this
line
if
the
allies
can
take
argenton
they
think
and
the
towns
north
toward
amiens
will
fall
too
i
don
t
know
about
yes
so
thinks
armand
as
well
said
michelle
a
trifle
wearily
but
we
can
not
reach
the
other
side
to
tell
them
what
we
lucy
fell
into
gloomy
silence
presently
with
an
effort
at
she
raised
her
hands
to
smooth
her
loosened
hair
and
tried
to
recover
some
of
her
calmness
you
have
enough
to
stand
without
bearing
my
tantrums
she
said
looking
at
michelle
remorsefully
i
ll
behave
now
shall
we
go
to
the
hospital
the
convalescents
are
waiting
for
their
yes
michelle
nodded
clemence
goes
to
the
commissariat
now
i
can
stay
at
the
hospital
with
you
until
she
neither
of
the
two
felt
much
like
talking
as
they
crossed
the
town
a
few
minutes
later
their
spirits
were
heavily
clouded
and
the
occasional
sighs
and
ejaculations
of
the
patient
old
frenchwoman
trudging
beside
them
found
an
echo
in
their
own
hearts
on
entering
the
hospital
lucy
noticed
an
unusual
stir
and
activity
about
the
wards
that
some
of
the
faces
turned
toward
her
were
sadder
than
an
hour
before
did
not
at
first
strike
her
because
she
was
sad
herself
but
the
next
moment
she
met
miss
pearse
and
seeing
the
young
nurse
s
troubled
face
asked
anxiously
is
anything
wrong
miss
pearse
anything
more
i
mean
only
that
they
are
sending
some
of
our
convalescents
to
prison
camps
the
order
came
just
after
you
left
oh
lucy
i
hated
so
to
tell
them
her
voice
shook
and
tears
started
to
her
eyes
but
she
swallowed
hastily
to
overcome
her
weakness
i
must
go
and
help
them
get
off
come
into
the
hall
and
try
to
cheer
them
up
a
easier
said
than
done
lucy
thought
wretchedly
she
wanted
to
do
nothing
so
much
as
to
cry
but
she
had
begun
to
learn
the
uselessness
of
that
michelle
caught
her
hand
with
a
hard
squeeze
of
angry
understanding
as
they
went
on
into
the
convalescents
hall
where
the
men
to
be
sent
away
were
assembled
one
of
the
first
that
lucy
saw
was
the
little
westerner
tyler
whose
cheerful
spirit
and
jolly
little
clay
images
had
done
so
much
for
the
others
in
the
past
few
days
she
longed
overwhelmingly
to
give
all
she
had
of
help
and
sympathy
to
her
unfortunate
countrymen
for
the
ten
or
twelve
soldiers
french
and
american
gathered
there
were
the
picture
of
despondency
the
strength
which
might
have
upheld
them
was
wanting
for
they
were
scarcely
recovered
or
able
to
be
about
their
cheeks
were
pale
and
their
bodies
thin
from
suffering
and
fever
all
the
courage
they
could
summon
was
only
enough
to
give
their
set
faces
a
look
of
grim
endurance
of
them
all
tyler
seemed
to
lucy
the
most
pitiful
his
hopeful
cockiness
was
almost
gone
and
the
strain
of
getting
ready
and
standing
about
after
the
days
spent
in
bed
or
in
a
chair
had
nearly
exhausted
his
wiry
little
frame
major
greyson
went
here
and
there
among
them
giving
what
help
or
advice
he
could
cast
down
like
them
by
the
knowledge
that
another
hour
would
see
them
beyond
his
power
to
aid
tyler
nodded
to
lucy
with
a
last
attempt
at
his
persistent
cheerfulness
well
miss
he
remarked
in
such
a
sad
ghost
of
his
old
chaffing
tone
that
lucy
could
hardly
bear
to
listen
i
guess
it
s
a
case
of
where
do
we
go
from
here
all
right
for
us
on
to
berlin
s
the
idea
i
suppose
hope
the
kaiser
don
t
take
a
fancy
to
adopt
me
say
he
added
with
a
look
of
utter
misery
in
his
eyes
who
d
a
thought
after
years
i
ve
spent
in
arizona
that
i
d
end
up
in
germany
lucy
stammered
out
words
of
hope
and
encouragement
which
deceived
him
no
more
than
they
did
herself
as
she
went
on
down
the
line
repeating
the
same
useless
efforts
michelle
ran
up
behind
her
and
caught
her
sharply
by
the
arm
the
french
girl
s
eyes
were
gleaming
and
two
crimson
spots
burned
in
her
pale
cheeks
come
with
me
lucy
she
commanded
rather
than
asked
the
hard
time
will
come
when
they
leave
there
we
must
be
to
say
farewell
for
they
go
almost
at
once
i
heard
speak
the
german
guard
this
only
half
understanding
lucy
allowed
herself
to
be
led
out
of
the
hall
into
the
big
ward
in
the
bustle
and
confusion
no
one
noticed
their
departure
they
went
out
by
the
side
door
into
the
garden
and
from
here
michelle
led
the
way
across
the
square
and
eastward
toward
the
edge
of
the
town
as
they
hurried
along
through
the
almost
deserted
streets
michelle
explained
again
her
purpose
they
must
pass
on
the
road
that
goes
across
the
meadows
on
their
way
from
she
said
breathing
fast
it
is
there
when
they
say
to
the
town
that
they
will
be
it
is
the
last
french
town
where
they
can
set
foot
for
but
two
miles
from
here
the
train
will
take
them
into
oh
michelle
it
s
too
dreadful
to
bear
cried
lucy
bitterly
rebelling
once
more
against
the
inevitable
it
is
not
the
first
time
that
i
have
seen
it
said
michelle
her
voice
suddenly
trembling
never
before
though
have
americans
gone
as
they
neared
the
meadows
making
for
the
road
that
ran
across
them
north
of
the
german
observation
post
the
empty
streets
became
filled
with
a
steady
line
of
people
hurrying
eastward
like
themselves
women
their
faces
half
concealed
by
shawls
with
children
running
beside
them
shared
the
road
with
bent
old
men
who
found
a
cautious
way
among
the
débris
of
broken
stone
michelle
s
was
not
the
only
loyal
french
heart
to
foresee
the
desolation
of
the
prisoners
on
reaching
the
outskirts
of
one
and
all
had
learned
the
news
somehow
and
had
come
out
at
any
cost
for
a
last
farewell
at
the
edge
of
the
field
where
lucy
and
michelle
paused
among
the
little
crowd
stood
old
mère
breton
with
a
covered
basket
on
the
ground
at
her
feet
the
bright
eyes
beneath
her
white
cap
were
sparkling
with
defiance
as
with
hands
on
her
hips
she
stared
across
the
grass
at
the
german
post
where
a
sentry
walked
looking
curiously
toward
the
little
throng
lucy
went
up
to
her
with
a
faint
smile
of
greeting
guessing
at
the
contents
of
the
basket
and
thinking
how
hopeless
any
kindness
was
which
could
not
follow
the
prisoners
beyond
the
german
border
i
have
something
here
nodded
the
frenchwoman
pointing
to
her
basket
in
answer
to
lucy
s
glance
they
will
get
a
taste
of
it
on
their
way
if
i
should
be
beaten
for
befriending
before
lucy
could
reply
michelle
drew
her
attention
by
pointing
silently
down
the
street
they
had
left
behind
the
little
column
of
prisoners
was
coming
along
it
preceded
by
two
german
soldiers
the
faded
blue
and
khaki
of
the
french
and
american
uniforms
showed
beyond
the
armed
gray
figures
leading
the
way
the
pace
had
not
been
slackened
for
these
men
just
from
the
hospital
in
spite
of
the
hot
sun
and
the
difficulty
of
walking
among
the
broken
stone
as
they
neared
the
field
some
of
the
men
glanced
back
into
the
desolate
streets
of
lucy
knew
how
dear
and
greatly
to
be
desired
the
little
town
must
seem
here
they
had
cherished
a
hope
of
freedom
and
here
too
were
friendly
hands
to
tend
them
and
friendly
faces
to
look
upon
ahead
lay
germany
where
how
many
of
their
comrades
had
gone
to
misery
and
death
where
at
best
only
wretchedness
awaited
them
in
a
moment
they
had
come
out
on
to
the
meadow
road
and
with
one
accord
every
voice
in
the
little
crowd
was
raised
in
greeting
and
farewell
kind
faces
eyes
brimming
with
tears
and
hands
with
trifling
presents
of
fruit
and
flowers
met
the
prisoners
on
their
way
the
children
ran
to
clasp
the
soldiers
hands
and
mère
breton
her
basket
on
her
arm
gave
out
her
little
store
of
provisions
as
fast
as
her
quick
fingers
could
move
all
this
took
so
short
a
time
that
the
guards
at
the
front
and
rear
of
the
column
had
scarcely
time
to
interfere
but
now
as
the
cries
on
every
side
grew
louder
and
the
crowd
closed
in
almost
on
the
prisoners
path
one
of
the
rear
guards
sprang
threateningly
forward
with
upraised
rifle
astonishment
and
fury
were
written
on
his
face
that
these
townspeople
so
docile
and
downtrodden
should
have
dared
thus
to
show
their
unquenchable
love
and
loyalty
the
prisoners
passed
and
the
little
crowd
gazing
after
the
retreating
column
with
eyes
blurred
with
tears
hardly
noticed
the
brutal
figure
advancing
upon
them
mère
breton
had
emptied
her
basket
and
was
standing
now
in
the
road
with
one
hand
shading
her
wrinkled
forehead
she
was
hoping
that
a
little
present
had
found
its
way
to
each
man
s
hands
her
thoughts
were
all
with
the
prisoners
on
their
hard
way
but
the
german
guard
took
her
preoccupation
for
defiance
he
had
charged
down
upon
the
people
remaining
in
the
road
and
as
these
scattered
the
butt
of
his
heavy
rifle
was
raised
directly
above
mère
breton
s
head
whether
he
really
meant
to
strike
the
old
woman
down
or
only
to
terrify
her
lucy
never
knew
in
common
with
half
a
dozen
others
she
sprang
to
mère
breton
s
side
and
dragged
her
back
as
the
german
s
rifle
cut
through
the
air
lucy
s
horror
almost
robbed
her
of
power
to
think
at
that
moment
but
she
had
to
think
quickly
nevertheless
michelle
had
rushed
in
front
of
the
old
frenchwoman
in
furious
defense
she
stood
facing
the
guard
with
hands
clenched
at
her
sides
her
blazing
eyes
confronting
the
man
s
angry
face
as
his
rifle
struck
the
earth
in
its
harmless
descent
his
fingers
clutched
it
as
though
for
another
blow
and
still
seeing
mère
breton
as
the
intended
victim
the
enraged
girl
was
actually
going
to
offer
battle
to
the
burly
man
before
her
but
mère
breton
had
slipped
safely
among
the
crowd
and
lucy
with
madame
de
la
tour
s
face
before
her
eyes
seized
her
friend
s
arm
and
dragged
her
back
with
all
her
young
strength
the
guard
indulging
in
more
brandishings
of
his
rifle
and
a
burst
of
abusive
words
turned
to
rejoin
his
prisoners
the
little
group
of
people
were
now
fast
dispersing
their
courage
shaken
and
only
fear
remaining
at
the
thought
of
possible
punishment
lucy
led
michelle
quickly
across
the
meadow
toward
the
town
she
did
not
try
to
speak
at
first
for
michelle
was
still
deadly
pale
and
shaking
with
anger
but
she
struggled
to
recover
her
and
in
five
minutes
more
had
calmed
herself
enough
to
say
unsteadily
i
did
not
think
what
i
did
lucy
only
to
save
that
poor
old
woman
i
would
fight
the
boche
i
could
not
help
i
know
but
think
of
your
mother
comes
first
said
lucy
this
time
the
wiser
of
the
two
yes
you
are
right
responded
michelle
sighing
she
walked
on
with
downcast
eyes
depressed
and
miserable
after
her
useless
outburst
of
indignation
lucy
could
not
find
words
to
express
the
pity
she
felt
for
her
instead
she
changed
the
subject
by
saying
i
m
coming
to
spend
the
night
with
you
michelle
had
you
forgotten
no
not
at
all
i
am
too
glad
that
you
will
come
to
forget
said
michelle
sincerely
she
looked
up
at
lucy
as
she
spoke
the
blazing
light
quenched
in
her
eyes
what
time
will
you
come
perhaps
a
little
more
early
i
m
not
sure
may
not
be
able
to
go
when
she
promised
said
lucy
floundering
a
little
but
she
said
she
could
bring
you
early
after
the
dark
michelle
persisted
said
so
but
you
never
know
don
t
expect
me
very
early
was
lucy
s
rather
evasive
answer
at
any
other
time
michelle
would
have
remarked
her
friend
s
lack
of
candor
but
just
now
she
was
too
unhappy
to
be
observant
i
d
better
leave
you
here
said
lucy
as
they
approached
the
middle
of
the
town
you
are
near
home
and
i
shall
go
straight
to
the
hospital
i
m
breaking
my
word
to
father
and
miss
pearse
every
i
suppose
our
being
together
isn
t
quite
like
running
off
alone
anyway
i
was
so
excited
i
never
yes
poor
maman
would
be
sadly
anxious
if
she
knew
michelle
agreed
soberly
then
i
will
wait
for
you
lucy
reëntered
the
hospital
with
slow
and
heavy
steps
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
she
had
grown
deeply
thankful
that
her
father
s
convalescence
was
slow
and
uncertain
suppose
he
had
been
one
of
those
to
whom
she
had
just
said
but
he
was
gaining
strength
daily
could
the
time
be
deferred
much
longer
when
he
would
be
sent
away
as
she
pondered
these
things
major
greyson
who
had
known
her
well
in
the
old
days
glanced
at
her
startled
by
the
change
in
her
face
her
hazel
eyes
had
become
sombre
and
watchful
her
lips
were
pressed
together
and
her
cheeks
at
that
moment
had
lost
their
healthy
color
the
surgeon
looked
after
her
frowning
and
troubled
he
was
thin
and
worn
himself
but
he
did
not
think
of
that
lucy
was
crossing
the
convalescents
hall
now
so
sparsely
occupied
toward
the
nurses
when
a
voice
called
eagerly
fräulein
fräulein
rebelling
at
the
sound
of
the
hateful
german
tongue
she
would
have
gone
on
unheeding
but
a
german
doctor
was
right
in
her
path
and
she
dared
not
risk
his
she
turned
toward
the
voice
and
saw
paul
schwartz
leaning
from
his
chair
with
a
bright
smile
on
his
face
half
lucy
s
anger
left
her
at
sight
of
him
she
could
not
cherish
it
against
this
simple
peasant
with
the
mild
eyes
and
childish
flaxen
hair
what
is
it
paul
she
asked
going
up
to
him
i
am
discharged
he
cried
his
voice
trembling
with
joy
and
his
blue
eyes
shining
i
start
for
the
schwarzwald
i
will
be
lame
he
added
his
smile
fading
a
little
but
i
can
get
about
and
it
is
much
to
be
at
home
lucy
had
not
the
heart
to
say
less
than
oh
that
s
fine
paul
i
m
so
glad
you
will
see
your
wife
then
and
the
little
girl
yes
yes
all
and
i
have
my
pension
a
i
will
come
and
say
before
you
go
lucy
promised
stumbling
with
the
german
words
as
pity
and
anger
struggled
together
in
her
heart
paul
was
going
back
to
his
peaceful
home
thankful
to
get
out
of
the
war
but
her
father
and
brother
and
countrymen
were
but
just
entering
it
a
long
hard
fight
was
ahead
of
them
in
a
minute
however
her
natural
good
sense
began
to
overcome
the
brooding
dread
that
was
tormenting
her
it
may
not
happen
she
told
herself
trying
to
be
hopeful
again
anyhow
i
won
t
be
any
good
this
way
for
what
i
have
to
and
at
thought
of
one
task
that
lay
before
her
she
felt
the
need
of
calmness
and
courage
as
never
before
she
nodded
to
paul
and
went
on
with
a
quicker
step
into
the
nurses
that
evening
a
little
after
eight
o
clock
lucy
drew
near
to
michelle
s
house
and
at
the
garden
gate
elizabeth
turned
to
leave
her
the
german
woman
had
snatched
this
time
to
bring
lucy
across
the
town
but
her
work
was
by
no
means
done
and
she
was
returning
at
once
to
the
hospital
lucy
bade
her
with
strange
reluctance
she
was
about
to
deceive
her
faithful
friend
and
she
hated
the
necessity
for
doing
so
but
elizabeth
could
not
spare
her
any
more
time
and
lucy
well
knew
she
could
never
win
her
old
nurse
s
consent
to
her
project
when
elizabeth
had
turned
her
back
lucy
went
a
few
steps
into
the
garden
and
waited
behind
the
shelter
of
a
bush
she
must
deceive
michelle
too
for
on
madame
de
la
tour
s
account
she
did
not
want
her
company
glad
as
she
would
otherwise
have
been
of
it
but
frightened
or
not
her
increasing
horror
at
the
german
captivity
now
far
outweighed
her
timidity
at
venturing
alone
to
the
prison
for
it
was
captain
beattie
she
was
determined
to
see
again
and
without
another
night
s
delay
after
a
moment
she
went
back
to
the
gate
and
looked
cautiously
down
the
street
elizabeth
had
disappeared
it
was
clear
moonlight
and
the
deserted
street
was
sharply
outlined
in
light
and
shadow
there
was
little
chance
of
moving
unobserved
in
the
moon
s
path
but
by
contrast
with
its
soft
radiance
the
shadows
looked
black
and
deep
along
the
walls
lucy
left
the
garden
and
made
her
way
as
quickly
as
constant
watchfulness
would
permit
along
the
now
familiar
streets
leading
toward
the
prison
she
was
in
a
miserable
state
of
mind
but
the
fear
that
hurried
her
footsteps
was
not
caused
by
her
own
solitary
errand
it
was
all
for
her
father
at
thought
of
the
irrevocable
fate
hanging
over
him
irrevocable
unless
she
could
do
something
to
prevent
it
for
however
feeble
her
efforts
must
be
she
saw
no
other
help
in
sight
remembering
the
chances
she
had
missed
of
communicating
with
the
allied
lines
she
came
near
to
thorough
dejection
how
differently
bob
would
have
managed
things
in
her
place
she
could
not
know
how
close
to
despair
her
brother
was
at
that
moment
and
how
his
cherished
plan
for
her
release
had
died
with
jourdin
s
death
since
the
battle
of
yesterday
lucy
hardly
dared
think
of
bob
she
reached
the
prison
square
and
slackening
her
pace
began
creeping
along
in
the
shadow
of
the
walls
the
prison
was
lighted
and
the
door
open
as
she
paused
uncertainly
flattening
herself
against
the
stones
of
the
house
opposite
the
old
guard
came
noisily
out
and
shouldering
their
guns
marched
off
across
the
square
the
relief
proceeded
to
make
a
round
of
the
prison
finding
all
secure
both
men
retired
into
the
again
and
shut
the
door
lucy
breathed
a
thankful
sigh
and
moved
cautiously
on
to
where
a
shadow
falling
on
the
street
gave
her
a
chance
to
cross
unseen
the
next
moment
she
was
behind
the
prison
and
lifting
herself
up
to
captain
beattie
s
window
he
was
there
close
by
it
as
though
expecting
her
and
the
warmth
of
his
welcome
did
something
toward
cheering
her
depression
you
got
off
safely
that
night
lucy
was
his
first
eager
question
those
prowling
soldiers
didn
t
see
you
how
that
s
worried
me
oh
they
didn
t
catch
a
glimpse
of
me
i
m
sorry
you
ve
been
anxious
here
s
all
i
could
bring
you
captain
beattie
she
said
smiling
it
s
better
than
for
two
days
lucy
had
saved
a
part
of
her
bread
and
potatoes
and
these
she
held
out
in
her
handkerchief
close
to
the
bars
the
young
prisoner
s
gratitude
made
her
almost
happy
for
a
moment
the
prison
wall
cast
a
deep
shade
on
the
courtyard
but
in
spite
of
it
a
little
light
penetrated
the
bars
and
for
the
first
time
since
she
had
visited
the
prison
lucy
could
see
the
young
officer
s
face
it
was
thin
and
sad
though
a
brave
smile
touched
his
lips
now
in
answer
to
her
searching
glance
what
should
i
do
without
you
lucy
he
asked
giving
her
hand
a
warm
friendly
grasp
as
she
clung
to
the
bars
goodness
i
don
t
do
much
said
lucy
sighing
as
she
spoke
she
remembered
that
time
was
precious
and
her
voice
grew
alert
and
earnest
you
can
t
possibly
get
out
of
s
sure
isn
t
it
the
englishman
laughed
rather
bitterly
quite
sure
the
surest
thing
i
know
some
famous
prisoners
i
ve
read
of
contrived
to
saw
their
bars
with
a
or
a
pair
of
scissors
but
i
don
t
seem
to
have
the
knack
of
don
t
you
ever
wonder
though
what
you
d
do
if
you
could
manage
to
get
you
would
escape
to
our
lines
of
course
i
do
there
never
was
a
prisoner
i
expect
who
didn
t
dream
of
escape
more
than
that
i
have
planned
it
all
across
the
german
lines
i
mean
it
s
a
beastly
waste
of
time
but
heavens
i
have
to
think
of
something
however
i
ll
be
out
soon
enough
he
added
grimly
they
ve
kept
me
here
to
be
questioned
by
the
divisional
commander
he
came
yesterday
and
our
talk
was
so
dull
i
dare
say
i
ll
be
on
my
way
to
germany
within
the
oh
perhaps
t
think
of
it
stammered
lucy
wretchedly
then
she
drew
a
quick
breath
i
wish
you
d
tell
me
anyway
about
your
plan
to
cross
the
lines
captain
beattie
you
must
be
so
tired
of
thinking
here
all
alone
i
want
to
talk
to
you
a
little
while
the
guard
has
just
been
around
so
they
won
t
come
you
know
i
heard
what
those
two
fellows
said
the
other
night
when
they
stopped
in
front
here
poor
kid
how
scared
you
must
have
i
was
you
mean
what
one
said
about
the
château
hill
being
a
weak
point
in
their
defenses
he
was
right
too
i
ve
been
all
over
that
part
of
the
month
when
the
germans
were
pushed
back
i
m
so
sure
of
the
ground
that
my
plan
for
breaking
through
was
made
for
that
spot
even
before
i
heard
those
soldiers
how
would
you
go
about
it
they
must
have
some
defenses
oh
yes
there
s
a
trench
line
running
right
through
the
château
old
one
but
poorly
garrisoned
as
they
are
here
they
don
t
hold
it
in
any
force
they
simply
mount
guard
on
the
hill
as
that
fellow
told
us
they
count
on
being
able
to
reinforce
the
trenches
long
before
an
infantry
column
could
advance
across
that
pond
and
but
the
big
t
there
any
up
there
there
were
last
winter
but
from
what
he
said
there
are
none
now
they
must
plan
to
rush
them
from
the
rear
in
case
of
an
attack
it
looks
like
a
real
shortage
of
well
aren
t
you
going
to
tell
me
your
scheme
if
you
really
want
to
hear
it
i
ve
spent
hours
devising
it
but
i
ll
cut
the
telling
short
first
you
ll
have
to
pretend
that
i
m
outside
the
getting
out
is
beyond
all
right
you
are
here
where
i
and
it
s
about
ten
at
night
but
no
moon
or
at
least
a
clouded
one
starlight
would
be
much
better
i
creep
along
the
streets
to
the
eastern
edge
of
the
i
don
t
dare
cross
it
straight
i
reach
the
meadows
these
i
skirt
gradually
getting
westward
and
nearer
their
lines
until
i
come
out
behind
the
château
hill
the
point
of
the
town
this
far
i
m
pretty
confident
of
success
the
place
is
too
deserted
for
me
to
be
discovered
short
of
villainous
now
you
re
behind
the
château
hill
lucy
prompted
getting
up
the
hill
through
the
wood
is
not
very
the
stream
you
know
the
place
i
m
not
likely
to
meet
a
soul
there
for
the
guards
probably
go
up
by
the
trenches
now
i
m
at
the
top
with
the
château
in
front
of
me
also
the
trench
line
and
the
sentries
but
we
can
take
it
that
the
trench
isn
t
held
or
they
wouldn
t
have
sentries
to
right
and
left
stretches
the
german
line
this
part
is
ticklish
some
nights
i
make
it
easily
enough
others
i
m
challenged
at
the
second
step
i
turn
left
around
the
park
avoiding
the
open
lawns
where
the
artificial
lake
and
the
fountains
are
and
keeping
well
under
the
trees
cross
the
trenches
at
an
unguarded
point
but
by
the
time
i
m
on
the
left
of
the
château
the
cover
ends
and
to
avoid
coming
out
on
to
the
grass
in
full
sight
of
a
sentry
i
have
to
climb
down
the
side
of
the
regular
precipice
just
here
if
i
remember
right
but
it
can
t
be
helped
it
s
dark
mossy
one
from
the
trenches
below
could
see
a
moving
figure
against
with
care
i
get
down
to
the
foot
safely
and
find
myself
at
the
edge
of
the
swamp
the
trenches
are
behind
me
on
the
left
of
the
hill
and
they
are
strongly
occupied
here
the
allies
lines
are
a
mile
away
beyond
the
swamp
and
pond
and
a
stretch
of
level
ground
my
back
aches
at
thought
of
covering
it
though
my
khaki
is
good
earth
color
in
the
but
the
you
get
through
that
oh
it
s
not
a
real
bog
you
don
t
go
in
above
your
ankles
but
every
step
is
likely
to
make
a
squelching
sound
this
is
the
place
where
the
chances
are
i
would
be
seen
or
heard
i
have
to
walk
bent
almost
double
among
the
long
grass
and
reeds
my
only
hope
is
that
the
big
in
the
marsh
have
accustomed
the
soldiers
ears
to
strange
the
trenches
are
only
a
hundred
yards
behind
me
on
this
side
of
the
hill
once
safely
through
the
marsh
i
drop
down
at
the
edge
of
the
pond
to
get
my
breath
and
reconnoitre
the
pond
extends
so
far
that
to
avoid
it
would
mean
a
long
détour
in
the
open
it
s
not
wide
though
scarcely
two
hundred
feet
the
castle
hill
is
a
quarter
of
a
mile
behind
me
i
m
well
on
my
way
if
a
stray
bullet
from
one
side
or
the
other
doesn
t
find
me
about
this
time
if
not
i
guarantee
to
slip
into
that
pond
without
a
sound
and
swim
across
undiscovered
provided
the
moon
doesn
t
shine
upon
it
to
show
me
climbing
out
on
the
far
bank
too
would
be
my
finish
i
can
only
trust
there
won
t
any
fall
my
way
once
i
ve
slipped
out
of
the
pond
and
started
crawling
forward
again
barring
i
have
faced
a
lot
and
missed
m
pretty
near
but
when
you
get
to
our
t
they
shoot
how
will
you
prove
who
you
are
lucy
asked
with
breathless
eagerness
i
ll
call
out
and
show
that
i
m
alone
i
d
convince
them
right
enough
wish
i
had
the
chance
they
won
t
shoot
without
a
look
at
me
too
many
of
their
own
men
are
likely
to
be
out
on
listening
there
was
a
moment
s
silence
then
the
young
officer
said
quickly
a
keen
in
his
low
voice
what
am
i
thinking
of
keeping
you
here
to
listen
to
all
this
nonsense
go
back
now
lucy
at
once
you
ve
been
here
long
all
right
she
agreed
after
a
minute
s
preoccupation
she
began
to
speak
again
stopped
short
and
finally
stretched
her
hand
through
the
bars
and
gave
her
friend
s
a
warm
lingering
clasp
captain
beattie
she
said
and
the
englishman
fancied
her
voice
shook
a
little
lucy
wish
better
luck
for
us
both
and
come
soon
again
or
you
ll
find
me
gone
he
answered
forcing
what
cheerfulness
he
could
into
the
cheerless
words
his
pity
for
lucy
just
then
stronger
than
any
for
himself
she
repeated
as
earnestly
as
before
then
dropping
down
from
the
bars
she
began
her
cautious
progress
back
around
the
prison
i
will
get
to
the
de
la
tours
by
ten
o
clock
she
thought
wondering
if
michelle
had
been
long
expecting
her
then
all
captain
beattie
had
said
crowding
into
her
mind
she
glanced
up
at
the
moon
with
troubled
eyes
as
though
it
felt
that
appealing
and
reproachful
look
its
bright
face
vanished
from
her
sight
behind
a
fleecy
little
cloud
early
the
next
morning
when
lucy
returned
to
the
hospital
she
met
major
greyson
in
the
ward
the
surgeon
s
face
was
so
sad
and
filled
with
dismay
that
lucy
stared
dumbly
at
him
he
did
not
wait
for
her
to
speak
i
ve
been
looking
for
you
he
said
drawing
her
aside
to
a
window
his
usually
brave
and
hopeful
voice
dull
and
heavy
i
ve
done
everything
possible
i
pretended
to
the
last
moment
but
the
german
doctor
himself
examined
all
the
patients
he
saw
that
the
colonel
had
no
as
lucy
with
swiftly
mounting
fear
struggled
to
understand
these
incoherent
phrases
major
greyson
reached
out
and
took
her
hand
in
his
it
s
no
use
lucy
i
ve
got
to
tell
you
your
father
is
considered
well
enough
to
travel
he
will
be
sent
to
germany
day
after
chapter
xv
across
the
lines
nine
that
night
lucy
entered
miss
pearse
s
bedroom
and
left
a
note
on
the
little
miss
pearse
did
not
come
off
duty
till
eleven
so
there
was
time
enough
lucy
thought
then
she
returned
to
the
hospital
and
stole
into
the
elizabeth
had
finished
her
work
there
and
against
the
wall
hung
the
apron
the
german
woman
would
put
on
again
at
daybreak
to
begin
her
hard
day
s
labor
lucy
slipped
another
note
into
the
pocket
and
turned
back
to
the
door
with
a
heavy
sigh
she
had
not
the
courage
for
farewells
made
without
betraying
her
purpose
and
to
betray
it
meant
to
put
an
end
to
her
plan
her
father
s
answer
would
be
instant
prohibition
elizabeth
would
certainly
tell
colonel
gordon
if
lucy
confided
in
her
and
even
michelle
s
terrified
persuasions
she
could
not
face
just
now
the
hospital
was
filled
with
its
usual
stream
of
tireless
workers
lucy
made
her
way
unnoticed
into
the
garden
and
out
into
the
street
she
looked
up
at
the
sky
with
deep
gratitude
for
the
moon
was
completely
hidden
behind
dull
heavy
clouds
a
warm
wind
was
blowing
with
rain
in
its
wake
it
tossed
lucy
s
hair
about
her
face
and
every
gust
brought
down
loose
fragments
of
brick
and
stone
from
some
crumbling
wall
near
by
she
longed
for
another
talk
with
captain
beattie
but
she
knew
well
enough
that
the
young
englishman
would
never
have
told
her
what
he
did
if
he
had
for
a
moment
guessed
her
purpose
she
was
puzzled
to
discover
at
that
moment
that
all
fear
had
left
her
she
did
not
realize
that
it
was
only
submerged
beneath
a
far
greater
dread
of
standing
at
that
meadow
road
and
watching
her
father
go
by
into
german
captivity
her
mind
was
but
little
excited
as
she
walked
quickly
along
the
dark
streets
toward
the
road
to
the
supply
depot
her
thoughts
just
then
were
all
with
her
mother
that
mother
she
had
trusted
in
so
entirely
for
guidance
until
these
last
few
months
and
to
whom
she
could
not
turn
now
for
help
in
her
necessity
but
even
this
thought
of
her
was
some
comfort
lucy
felt
dimly
that
her
mother
did
she
know
would
understand
in
spite
of
fearing
for
her
safety
that
she
could
not
stay
helplessly
in
and
leave
her
father
to
his
fate
if
captain
beattie
s
knowledge
can
help
the
allies
i
must
try
to
reach
them
she
thought
without
any
further
doubt
or
hesitation
at
the
end
of
half
a
mile
she
came
to
a
narrow
street
leading
south
up
a
gentle
slope
it
was
the
one
that
she
and
michelle
had
followed
when
they
went
to
the
stream
below
the
château
hill
in
search
of
clay
for
the
convalescents
lucy
recognized
it
by
the
little
church
that
stood
at
the
corner
its
pointed
spire
still
undamaged
showing
faintly
against
the
cloudy
sky
she
turned
to
the
left
up
the
street
and
stole
cautiously
along
it
this
was
the
part
of
town
nearest
the
and
soldiers
were
likely
to
be
met
with
in
the
south
toward
montdidier
she
could
hear
the
guns
faintly
booming
but
in
front
of
all
was
quiet
enough
the
street
gradually
rose
higher
becoming
a
lane
that
opened
out
into
woodland
part
way
up
the
château
hill
it
was
nearly
half
a
mile
from
the
little
church
to
where
the
lane
ended
and
lucy
s
cautious
feet
took
some
time
to
cover
it
the
moon
was
still
hidden
for
the
had
grown
heavier
the
wind
too
had
increased
and
when
she
came
out
on
to
the
hill
the
pine
branches
were
tossing
furiously
about
with
a
noise
like
dashing
water
she
paused
for
breath
after
her
quick
climb
up
the
slope
and
peered
ahead
through
the
trees
and
then
back
toward
the
town
the
scattered
houses
along
the
street
she
had
left
were
in
darkness
for
no
unnecessary
lights
were
permitted
after
eight
o
clock
all
around
her
was
darkness
too
through
which
she
could
distinguish
the
black
the
outline
of
the
wooded
hill
in
front
of
her
and
the
clouds
scudding
overhead
her
heart
had
begun
to
pound
with
exertion
and
excitement
and
her
mind
wavered
in
its
calm
confidence
but
her
determination
was
as
strong
as
ever
if
she
could
not
go
on
cool
and
fearless
she
would
do
so
trembling
and
afraid
but
go
on
she
must
she
drew
a
long
breath
and
began
climbing
the
hill
through
the
dense
growth
of
pines
in
a
few
minutes
she
came
to
the
stream
whose
course
she
and
michelle
had
followed
down
to
the
clay
bed
at
the
foot
of
the
slope
she
could
hear
the
water
flowing
swiftly
over
the
stones
close
beside
her
and
shaping
her
course
by
it
she
kept
near
the
middle
of
the
hill
and
before
many
moments
reached
the
level
ground
above
here
she
stopped
resting
her
hand
on
a
swaying
pine
trunk
and
listening
intently
no
sound
but
the
wind
in
the
trees
came
to
her
ears
thinking
of
captain
beattie
s
words
some
nights
i
make
it
easily
i
m
challenged
at
the
second
step
she
crept
out
of
the
wood
to
the
edge
of
the
wide
open
lawns
behind
the
château
the
towers
of
the
beautiful
old
building
rose
dimly
against
the
sky
about
five
hundred
yards
ahead
at
the
end
of
a
broad
avenue
of
pines
one
tower
had
been
destroyed
by
leaving
only
a
crumbling
ruin
across
the
lawns
she
saw
the
broad
dark
line
that
marked
the
trenches
further
on
the
pine
groves
closed
in
again
covering
the
slopes
of
the
hillside
to
the
right
of
the
château
lucy
caught
sight
of
the
little
artificial
lake
by
the
dull
gleam
reflected
on
its
surface
near
the
edge
stood
a
with
slender
marble
columns
her
eyes
lingered
on
it
trying
to
detach
a
dark
shadow
from
the
climbing
roses
that
fell
in
a
shower
over
the
white
columns
in
a
minute
the
shadow
moved
and
became
the
figure
of
a
german
sentry
he
strolled
out
to
the
border
of
the
lake
and
raised
his
head
toward
the
stormy
sky
lucy
glanced
quickly
around
her
suddenly
cold
in
spite
of
the
sultry
heat
before
the
storm
she
felt
surrounded
trapped
before
she
had
even
left
the
cover
of
the
woods
that
solitary
sentry
became
a
company
of
men
searching
for
her
with
keen
merciless
eyes
furious
at
her
own
weakness
she
looked
around
once
more
for
reassurance
there
were
no
other
guards
in
sight
anyway
she
must
go
on
she
crept
back
into
the
shadow
of
the
pines
and
began
circling
the
crest
of
the
hill
to
the
left
watching
and
listening
with
infinite
caution
of
the
trenches
running
across
the
lawns
she
had
seen
nothing
but
a
dark
line
of
defenses
if
there
were
men
behind
them
they
were
invisible
she
was
following
one
of
the
pretty
paths
that
wound
through
the
wooded
park
of
the
château
in
another
moment
she
came
upon
felled
pine
trunks
and
earth
over
which
she
stumbled
breathless
with
terror
she
waited
tensely
for
a
challenge
but
none
came
not
a
voice
was
heard
though
before
her
she
could
now
see
the
a
deep
cut
in
the
ground
with
earth
in
front
of
it
she
stole
up
to
the
very
edge
and
looked
down
a
fallen
pine
trunk
had
been
laid
across
as
a
the
complete
lack
of
human
voices
or
movement
below
told
her
that
the
trench
was
deserted
but
no
answering
hope
or
confidence
sprang
up
within
her
that
lazy
figure
by
the
lake
had
not
looked
as
if
he
had
the
entire
hill
to
guard
if
the
trenches
were
empty
the
line
was
watched
some
other
way
in
her
wary
and
suspicious
advance
lucy
put
one
foot
on
the
slab
of
pine
trunk
that
served
as
bridge
testing
her
foothold
and
staring
across
into
the
shadows
just
as
she
started
forward
a
twig
cracked
beneath
a
heavy
foot
and
a
sentry
came
into
view
on
the
other
side
of
the
trench
lucy
had
flung
herself
on
the
ground
among
the
fallen
boughs
before
the
german
had
even
time
to
turn
his
head
the
wind
sighing
through
the
branches
effectively
drowned
whatever
slight
noise
she
made
the
sentry
shifted
his
gun
without
a
glance
in
her
direction
and
passed
up
the
line
among
the
trees
for
five
minutes
lucy
lay
there
motionless
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
sentry
returned
along
his
beat
at
his
reappearance
despair
almost
conquered
lucy
s
terror
she
knew
she
dared
not
venture
across
that
abandoned
line
in
the
darkness
on
unknown
ground
she
stood
little
chance
of
passing
undiscovered
to
judge
by
the
length
of
the
soldier
s
beat
at
least
a
dozen
sentries
must
be
patrolling
the
woods
about
the
castle
the
lawns
were
easily
watched
from
the
or
from
the
château
for
one
desperate
minute
retreat
suggested
itself
to
lucy
s
mind
but
and
anger
mounted
swifter
than
the
thought
took
shape
and
she
knew
that
her
purpose
remained
undaunted
all
courage
aside
she
was
as
afraid
to
turn
back
as
to
go
on
to
make
her
way
to
the
town
again
confessing
failure
and
facing
the
certainty
of
her
father
s
departure
as
that
realization
swept
over
her
she
crept
up
to
a
pine
tree
and
leaning
against
its
base
searched
feverishly
for
some
way
to
go
on
the
château
that
was
a
part
of
the
line
of
defense
and
to
pass
through
it
would
be
to
pass
the
trenches
however
full
of
unknown
perils
it
might
be
she
thought
she
could
face
them
better
there
than
in
this
gloomy
and
terrifying
wood
but
here
difficulties
again
confronted
her
was
the
château
inhabited
she
had
seen
no
lights
but
surely
the
sentries
would
be
likely
to
take
refuge
in
it
from
the
storm
could
she
possibly
get
through
that
great
building
unseen
since
not
a
step
of
the
way
would
be
familiar
but
think
as
she
would
no
other
solution
came
to
her
even
in
her
dark
dress
she
dared
not
try
to
cross
the
open
lawns
the
wind
was
bending
the
pliant
pine
boughs
in
every
direction
and
some
of
them
struck
against
her
as
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
started
back
the
way
she
had
come
in
a
few
minutes
she
paused
uncertainly
for
she
no
longer
felt
the
path
beneath
her
feet
fearful
of
completely
losing
her
way
she
turned
directly
toward
the
château
and
presently
came
out
at
the
edge
of
the
lawn
not
far
from
the
avenue
the
château
was
approached
by
a
drive
winding
up
the
gentler
slope
on
the
side
of
the
hill
toward
the
town
this
road
became
the
avenue
that
ran
over
the
lawns
offering
lucy
shelter
from
near
where
she
stood
to
the
terrace
at
the
rear
of
the
building
a
flash
of
lightning
cut
through
the
dark
clouds
as
she
reached
the
avenue
by
that
flash
she
saw
the
road
stretching
empty
before
her
she
began
running
oblivious
to
prowling
sentries
the
only
sounds
in
her
ears
the
sigh
of
the
swaying
branches
on
each
side
and
the
distant
rumbling
thunder
in
five
minutes
she
stopped
panting
a
few
yards
from
the
terrace
at
the
back
of
the
château
long
french
windows
opened
on
to
it
but
their
glass
had
long
ago
been
shattered
and
in
the
wind
the
neglected
shutters
were
banging
to
and
fro
lucy
stole
up
the
steps
of
the
terrace
and
approaching
one
of
the
windows
flattened
herself
against
the
wall
and
glanced
back
about
the
lawns
and
gardens
by
the
lake
the
sentry
was
still
pacing
she
could
see
the
faint
gleam
of
his
bayonet
as
he
moved
but
he
had
not
discovered
her
no
other
sentry
was
in
sight
so
far
as
she
could
pierce
the
shadows
she
turned
to
the
window
and
peeped
cautiously
through
darkness
reigned
within
and
the
wind
whistling
through
the
rooms
made
the
heavy
hangings
against
the
walls
flap
like
sails
in
a
storm
with
a
quick
sigh
that
was
something
like
a
gasp
at
thought
of
the
unknown
dangers
before
her
lucy
stepped
through
the
window
shrinking
from
the
jagged
edges
of
the
broken
glass
that
caught
at
her
hands
and
clothing
inside
she
stopped
for
a
second
making
sure
of
her
direction
then
moved
on
through
the
room
feeling
every
step
of
the
way
and
more
than
once
narrowly
avoiding
a
collision
with
some
piece
of
furniture
in
her
path
she
reached
the
opposite
side
and
saw
an
open
doorway
leading
onward
beyond
it
was
a
large
hall
or
for
at
the
far
end
were
windows
and
the
lightning
playing
against
them
showed
the
vast
interior
filled
with
the
débris
of
broken
furniture
but
quite
deserted
enormously
relieved
lucy
started
quickly
forward
urged
by
a
rising
hope
of
success
in
her
impulsive
haste
she
ran
full
against
a
stool
or
small
table
startled
she
sprang
back
and
the
object
flung
aside
by
her
sudden
movement
fell
to
the
floor
with
a
noise
that
echoed
through
the
building
almost
with
the
sound
a
door
was
thrown
open
somewhat
on
her
right
as
she
stood
frozen
to
the
spot
with
horror
a
candle
shone
out
of
the
darkness
and
a
loud
commanding
voice
shouted
wilhelm
wilhelm
scarcely
were
the
words
spoken
when
lucy
recovering
her
power
of
motion
fled
across
the
room
glancing
wildly
about
her
for
some
way
out
the
windows
in
front
were
raised
from
the
floor
and
she
dared
not
try
to
climb
through
one
and
risk
showing
herself
against
a
glare
of
lightning
on
her
left
she
dimly
saw
an
open
doorway
with
pounding
heart
she
darted
to
it
and
arms
outstretched
before
her
passed
through
the
opening
down
a
corridor
and
found
herself
before
an
arched
entrance
lighted
by
a
faint
red
glow
the
room
beyond
into
which
she
ran
mortal
fear
of
what
lay
behind
driving
her
on
was
huge
and
lofty
with
narrow
pointed
windows
whose
leaded
panes
were
imitated
in
the
glass
doors
of
the
countless
bookcases
which
lined
the
walls
the
fire
which
gave
light
to
see
burned
faintly
in
a
massive
marble
and
was
mostly
fed
by
some
of
the
priceless
books
torn
from
these
very
shelves
before
the
chimney
were
several
pots
and
kettles
and
other
evidences
that
the
fire
was
used
by
the
sentries
to
cook
their
food
since
an
abundance
of
fuel
lay
close
at
hand
in
the
thousands
of
volumes
the
library
contained
they
were
strewn
all
over
the
polished
floor
and
lucy
stumbled
over
them
as
she
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
room
looking
desperately
around
her
for
some
place
of
concealment
or
escape
there
were
no
hangings
on
the
walls
and
the
bookcases
seemed
to
offer
no
safe
she
approached
the
chimney
with
a
vague
idea
of
crouching
behind
its
shadowy
columns
by
the
flickering
firelight
the
motto
cut
into
the
marble
caught
her
eyes
avant
pour
le
illustration
she
approached
the
chimney
but
now
hearing
no
sound
of
pursuit
her
terrified
mind
regained
a
little
power
of
thought
she
stole
over
toward
the
windows
on
the
right
one
of
which
was
entirely
shattered
fearful
of
listening
ears
she
moved
with
infinite
caution
and
reaching
the
window
stood
aside
from
it
to
peer
out
on
to
the
terrace
and
lawns
in
front
of
the
château
a
clearing
had
been
cut
in
the
trees
that
crowned
the
hilltop
to
open
a
view
of
the
valley
below
just
now
the
trees
were
only
dark
blotches
framing
a
stormy
sky
lucy
drew
back
after
one
swift
glance
a
sentry
was
walking
across
the
lawn
beyond
the
terrace
struggling
with
the
confusion
that
began
to
take
possession
of
her
she
looked
toward
the
windows
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
at
that
moment
heavy
footsteps
sounded
in
the
corridor
with
the
gruff
murmur
of
conversation
between
two
advancing
men
then
the
voice
from
which
she
had
fled
raised
more
angrily
than
before
against
the
increasing
noise
of
the
wind
shouted
wilhelm
wilhelm
sehen
sie
there
were
no
two
ways
open
as
the
germans
entered
the
library
lucy
slipped
through
the
broken
window
and
dropping
on
her
hands
and
knees
crawled
along
the
stone
terrace
over
a
broad
parapet
of
rising
in
her
way
until
she
reached
the
lawn
that
voice
had
been
heard
beyond
the
château
walls
for
as
shaking
with
fear
she
looked
back
to
where
the
sentry
paced
she
saw
the
man
running
up
the
steps
of
the
terrace
toward
the
library
windows
without
waiting
for
more
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
ran
like
a
deer
to
the
crest
of
the
hill
where
it
sloped
down
to
the
valley
she
was
well
ahead
of
the
precipitous
rocks
down
which
captain
beattie
had
planned
his
descent
she
made
for
the
gentler
declivity
in
front
dodging
about
a
big
raised
platform
that
was
a
german
as
she
crossed
the
clearing
which
opened
like
a
little
amphitheatre
in
the
woody
hillside
a
marble
set
in
the
centre
big
raindrops
began
to
fall
lightning
glared
from
the
heavy
and
the
rumbling
thunder
was
succeeded
by
a
tremendous
peal
then
the
pine
trees
swallowed
her
up
and
she
began
to
feel
her
way
among
the
trunks
which
bent
and
groaned
about
her
in
the
fierce
gusts
of
wind
whether
the
front
of
the
hill
was
guarded
below
the
crest
lucy
had
no
idea
even
had
she
known
there
were
sentries
about
her
she
could
have
done
nothing
else
than
press
on
panting
in
the
windy
darkness
the
growing
downpour
of
rain
penetrating
the
branches
and
striking
on
her
head
and
shoulders
now
and
again
the
lightning
shone
on
her
path
revealing
the
rough
wet
trunks
and
writhing
green
boughs
around
her
and
the
thunder
crashing
overhead
drowned
the
incessant
noise
of
the
wind
and
rain
the
storm
had
become
the
only
enemy
against
which
she
struggled
as
step
by
step
she
fought
her
way
down
the
slope
at
last
when
a
strong
blast
of
wind
showed
her
she
was
nearing
the
open
a
flash
of
lightning
disclosed
the
gleaming
wet
swamp
and
the
level
ground
around
it
at
the
base
of
the
hill
beneath
the
last
pine
tree
lucy
flung
herself
on
the
ground
to
catch
her
breath
she
was
drenched
from
head
to
foot
with
wet
fingers
she
felt
inside
her
dress
to
see
that
captain
beattie
s
precious
paper
was
safely
held
in
its
scrap
of
canvas
and
protecting
handkerchief
reassured
she
pushed
her
dripping
hair
from
her
face
and
stared
out
over
the
swamp
she
knew
that
great
obstacles
were
still
before
her
but
she
had
burned
her
bridges
to
retreat
through
the
château
was
unthinkable
in
a
few
minutes
the
rain
and
wind
began
to
diminish
and
the
clouds
overhead
parted
turning
from
black
to
gray
the
lightning
became
less
frequent
and
the
thunder
sank
to
a
sullen
muttering
lucy
studied
the
sky
with
deep
anxiety
she
was
eager
to
have
the
lightning
cease
but
knowing
the
uncertainty
of
summer
storms
she
dreaded
lest
the
clouds
should
drift
entirely
by
and
the
moon
appear
while
she
was
still
before
the
enemy
s
eyes
there
was
no
time
to
lose
and
she
had
begun
to
fear
that
wilhelm
s
master
might
put
the
men
in
the
trenches
on
guard
against
the
unknown
intruder
she
sprang
up
and
stepped
out
on
level
ground
and
into
the
spongy
yielding
earth
at
the
border
of
the
marsh
she
knew
that
the
trenches
were
close
behind
on
her
left
and
a
shiver
ran
through
her
as
her
foot
withdrew
from
the
soaked
ground
with
a
loud
squelching
noise
on
a
quiet
night
any
sound
might
have
reached
her
from
where
the
soldiers
watched
behind
their
defenses
but
in
the
rumbling
thunder
and
the
gusts
of
wind
blowing
away
the
last
of
the
rain
she
heard
no
sign
of
their
presence
the
reedy
grass
came
above
her
waist
as
she
stooped
forward
feeling
her
way
along
the
precarious
footing
every
nerve
and
muscle
on
the
alert
to
receive
the
warning
of
danger
an
occasional
backward
glance
at
the
château
towers
rising
above
the
gloom
of
the
hill
was
her
only
guide
for
the
plain
stretched
dimly
in
front
until
it
was
lost
in
obscurity
suddenly
with
a
frightened
squawk
a
big
rose
with
flapping
wings
from
under
her
very
feet
with
loud
cries
at
such
unexpected
disturbance
it
fluttered
over
her
head
and
only
settled
down
once
more
when
she
had
been
reduced
to
abject
terror
whether
the
keen
ears
behind
her
became
suspicious
at
the
bird
s
alarm
or
whether
the
quieting
of
the
storm
made
sounds
more
clearly
audible
lucy
at
that
moment
heard
a
voice
it
came
from
the
trenches
but
what
it
said
or
ordered
she
had
no
idea
it
gave
strength
and
speed
to
her
tired
and
trembling
limbs
so
that
she
fled
on
across
the
marsh
nearly
as
fast
as
though
she
were
on
dry
and
level
ground
her
ankles
ached
unbearably
and
her
beating
heart
hammered
against
her
ribs
when
she
stumbled
on
to
a
little
ridge
of
grassy
ground
just
beyond
the
swampy
bottom
with
stooping
shoulders
and
head
bent
down
she
had
no
chance
to
see
ahead
now
she
looked
up
and
saw
the
dull
gleam
of
water
only
a
few
yards
in
front
with
a
sigh
of
utter
weariness
she
dropped
to
the
wet
earth
and
lay
motionless
a
bright
glow
reflected
in
the
waters
of
the
pond
made
her
start
up
she
thought
of
lightning
but
one
glance
showed
her
the
graceful
form
of
a
falling
across
the
sky
it
came
from
the
allies
lines
the
french
and
americans
were
on
the
watch
for
any
surprise
attempted
under
cover
of
the
cloudy
darkness
lucy
sank
back
to
earth
a
bitter
reproach
in
her
heart
for
this
friendly
weapon
discharged
against
her
the
light
sputtered
out
and
with
the
return
of
darkness
she
sat
up
and
struggled
for
courage
to
go
on
she
drew
captain
beattie
s
message
from
inside
her
dress
and
tied
the
handkerchief
around
her
forehead
like
a
bandage
she
felt
doubtfully
of
her
rubber
soled
sneakers
and
deciding
they
were
too
light
to
impede
her
progress
crept
forward
to
the
edge
of
the
pond
at
that
moment
a
sound
which
she
had
heard
a
second
before
and
wondered
at
was
unmistakably
repeated
the
germans
in
the
trenches
were
replying
to
the
with
a
scattering
fire
the
shots
were
few
and
far
apart
but
lucy
heard
one
bullet
sing
over
her
head
and
that
was
enough
there
is
a
courage
that
comes
with
desperation
and
it
was
this
which
caused
her
to
crawl
instantly
forward
into
the
lake
and
strike
out
across
it
the
cool
water
brought
a
welcome
sense
of
refreshment
and
cleared
her
whirling
mind
a
little
she
swam
on
strongly
trying
hard
to
make
no
sound
and
to
keep
her
arms
beneath
the
surface
and
searching
the
sky
with
frightened
eyes
dreading
to
see
another
flaring
up
she
heard
no
more
shots
behind
her
and
this
brought
back
a
little
hope
she
struggled
to
keep
the
stroke
even
and
not
to
hurry
it
for
the
pond
was
at
least
one
hundred
feet
across
and
she
was
burdened
by
her
clothing
but
to
swim
slowly
and
calmly
was
too
much
for
her
she
could
not
resist
bursts
of
speed
as
from
the
darkness
behind
her
straining
ears
imagined
every
sort
of
approaching
peril
when
at
last
she
neared
the
opposite
bank
her
breath
was
coming
in
painful
gasps
and
she
was
dangerously
near
exhaustion
with
a
few
more
frenzied
strokes
she
managed
to
get
within
her
depth
and
in
another
moment
crawled
weakly
out
on
to
the
grassy
field
beyond
she
lay
there
on
her
back
a
prayer
of
thankfulness
on
her
lips
though
as
she
untied
the
handkerchief
from
about
her
head
she
watched
the
sky
with
fresh
anxiety
the
clouds
were
rapidly
dispersing
and
a
faint
silvery
gleam
announced
the
moon
s
coming
she
thought
that
in
another
quarter
of
an
hour
these
level
fields
would
be
flooded
with
moonlight
and
she
too
far
from
either
line
to
be
closely
distinguished
would
be
a
target
for
both
sides
but
she
had
to
have
breath
to
move
and
for
five
minutes
longer
she
lay
panting
before
she
rose
from
the
ground
and
began
plodding
wearily
on
her
body
bent
forward
and
her
feet
stumbling
over
the
little
grassy
hummocks
in
her
way
a
line
of
dark
objects
coming
suddenly
into
view
gave
her
a
sickening
pang
of
fear
but
as
she
crept
up
to
them
they
proved
to
be
only
the
stumps
of
what
had
been
a
row
of
trees
bordering
a
field
it
seemed
to
lucy
that
she
had
struggled
on
for
long
miles
through
the
darkness
when
all
at
once
the
moon
shone
out
in
cloudy
radiance
with
a
gasp
she
stopped
short
staring
wildly
before
her
not
three
hundred
yards
in
front
a
tangle
of
posts
and
barbed
wire
extended
before
the
allies
trenches
she
was
in
plain
sight
but
at
that
moment
even
a
bullet
from
her
own
countrymen
seemed
better
than
what
she
had
fled
from
so
long
she
raised
both
arms
above
her
head
and
walked
straight
on
toward
the
edge
of
the
barbed
wire
behind
which
showed
the
parapet
of
the
trenches
rifle
barrels
glinted
over
the
top
and
a
helmeted
head
popped
into
sight
stammered
lucy
her
scared
little
voice
sounding
strangely
out
of
the
night
don
t
shoot
i
m
an
american
it
s
a
s
a
girl
cried
an
astonished
voice
a
dozen
heads
were
raised
above
the
trench
a
murmur
of
voices
filled
the
air
and
the
next
instant
two
soldiers
had
sprung
over
the
top
and
were
running
toward
her
the
first
caught
her
by
the
arm
and
drew
her
swiftly
toward
the
trenches
saying
through
this
s
a
lane
in
the
wire
but
where
on
earth
do
you
come
from
demanded
the
second
slipping
between
her
and
the
distant
german
lines
just
follow
on
now
as
quick
as
you
can
urged
her
guide
lucy
hardly
heard
them
she
knew
that
she
was
led
safely
through
the
wire
and
that
strong
arms
lifted
her
down
inside
the
american
lines
for
a
minute
she
was
near
to
fainting
but
the
triumph
filling
her
heart
cleared
her
brain
and
overcame
her
exhaustion
a
light
flashed
in
front
of
her
and
some
one
held
a
cup
of
water
to
her
lips
as
she
sat
on
the
of
the
trench
and
leaned
panting
against
the
parapet
a
dozen
soldiers
had
crowded
around
her
expressing
every
degree
of
pity
wonder
and
admiration
the
next
moment
the
light
revealed
a
sergeant
hurrying
along
the
trench
with
an
officer
following
here
she
is
lieutenant
said
the
sergeant
as
they
stopped
at
lucy
s
side
the
lantern
raised
above
lucy
s
head
illumined
her
figure
as
disheveled
and
drenching
wet
she
sat
on
the
muddy
the
young
officer
s
astonished
face
was
on
a
level
with
hers
as
he
sank
down
beside
her
asking
hurriedly
you
re
an
american
what
on
earth
were
you
doing
out
there
in
front
of
our
lines
in
front
lucy
repeated
faintly
why
i
came
from
behind
the
german
came
from
from
château
the
lieutenant
s
words
were
lost
in
a
cheer
that
rang
out
deafeningly
between
the
trench
s
narrow
walls
helmets
were
frantically
waved
in
the
air
and
a
dozen
hands
were
held
out
for
lucy
s
grasp
by
the
eager
listeners
about
her
she
felt
her
face
flush
hot
and
her
heart
bound
with
happiness
it
was
had
succeeded
it
was
hard
to
realize
she
crossed
the
german
lines
that
alone
be
lieutenant
wants
to
talk
to
the
murmur
died
away
as
the
officer
no
less
enthusiastic
than
his
men
at
that
moment
inquired
once
more
you
got
over
here
from
inside
the
town
without
being
seen
you
deserve
a
war
medal
what
were
you
doing
in
my
father
is
there
a
prisoner
he
s
colonel
gordon
i
had
to
come
lucy
answered
still
breathless
and
somewhat
incoherent
then
she
started
forward
from
where
she
had
leaned
wearily
against
the
supporting
timbers
of
the
trench
saying
earnestly
i
can
t
tell
you
the
rest
now
where
is
the
divisional
commander
will
you
take
me
to
him
i
have
news
for
him
that
mustn
t
wait
any
longer
and
i
am
afraid
he
is
a
long
way
from
clinton
is
at
a
farm
only
five
miles
behind
here
and
cantigny
he
has
been
inspecting
along
the
line
of
course
you
may
see
him
the
lieutenant
added
rather
puzzled
but
must
it
be
at
once
you
look
used
up
and
the
trip
will
be
pretty
uncomfortable
after
all
this
rain
the
roads
are
a
sea
of
to
mention
a
walk
through
the
almost
laughed
aloud
at
his
words
she
had
seen
a
good
deal
of
both
that
night
and
what
were
they
compared
to
the
anguish
of
mind
she
had
borne
in
the
past
weeks
she
could
endure
any
hardships
now
with
this
glorious
hope
flooding
her
heart
i
don
t
mind
how
bad
it
is
she
said
quickly
i
only
want
to
see
the
general
as
soon
as
i
the
young
officer
read
the
clear
eager
purpose
in
her
eyes
and
gave
a
nod
of
consent
at
his
order
a
soldier
led
the
way
with
alacrity
lantern
in
hand
along
the
trench
lucy
rose
and
followed
and
the
lieutenant
came
behind
her
after
stopping
for
a
word
with
the
sergeant
we
have
half
a
mile
to
walk
he
told
lucy
pointing
ahead
along
the
mud
and
water
of
the
trench
bottom
she
nodded
undismayed
the
line
of
men
standing
behind
their
rifles
at
the
parapet
of
whom
many
turned
to
her
with
looks
of
astonishment
and
eager
friendliness
were
but
dim
figures
that
seemed
a
dream
they
re
americans
i
m
with
americans
she
repeated
to
herself
and
the
joy
welling
up
at
the
thought
made
her
almost
dizzy
as
she
trudged
along
the
wet
slippery
path
it
is
at
such
moments
that
physical
discomfort
is
hardly
felt
and
weary
though
she
was
lucy
did
not
suffer
greatly
during
the
long
hour
s
journey
the
tramp
through
the
trenches
was
followed
by
a
ride
in
the
bottom
of
a
along
a
dark
road
that
the
rain
had
transformed
into
a
bog
the
three
passengers
were
flung
from
side
to
side
as
the
heavy
wheels
struggled
through
the
ruts
or
careened
into
the
deep
gullies
the
laboring
motor
stalled
and
missed
fire
and
the
moon
hidden
again
behind
a
cloud
gave
no
light
now
when
it
was
so
sorely
needed
at
last
the
truck
reached
drier
ground
and
stopped
before
a
lighted
house
in
the
middle
of
a
grassy
meadow
and
bruised
from
the
terrific
jolting
lucy
was
helped
down
and
the
young
officer
took
hold
of
her
arm
and
led
her
inside
the
door
in
the
little
hallway
he
left
her
to
speak
with
an
orderly
who
preceded
him
to
an
adjoining
room
lucy
heard
murmurs
of
conversation
and
beyond
the
doorway
saw
a
second
officer
standing
with
papers
in
his
hand
she
took
out
the
handkerchief
from
inside
her
dress
making
also
a
futile
effort
to
smooth
her
hair
which
drying
during
the
long
ride
had
begun
to
curl
in
a
tangled
mass
about
her
head
in
another
moment
the
young
lieutenant
who
had
brought
her
returned
saying
come
right
in
the
general
will
see
lucy
followed
him
into
the
anteroom
whose
farther
door
the
other
officer
was
holding
open
beyond
it
a
man
with
hair
was
seated
at
a
big
desk
under
the
electric
light
his
face
was
turned
toward
the
door
and
as
lucy
entered
he
rose
sharply
to
his
feet
saying
with
quick
earnestness
you
are
colonel
james
gordon
s
daughter
you
came
from
he
put
his
hands
on
lucy
s
shoulders
fixing
his
eyes
on
hers
yes
general
lucy
answered
with
trembling
eagerness
i
am
lucy
gordon
i
have
been
in
since
before
the
germans
took
it
my
father
is
there
you
got
through
the
enemy
crossed
over
to
us
alone
the
general
insisted
his
glance
softening
with
pity
and
wonder
as
he
surveyed
lucy
s
and
bedraggled
figure
and
the
shining
eager
eyes
in
her
tired
face
yes
i
did
i
had
to
they
are
going
to
send
father
into
germany
and
i
couldn
t
stay
there
and
do
nothing
when
i
thought
i
had
a
chance
to
save
you
have
courage
enough
for
anything
what
can
we
do
though
poor
they
will
delay
your
father
s
going
for
some
days
longer
but
tell
me
how
on
earth
you
got
over
here
i
brought
you
something
that
i
know
will
help
lucy
persisted
and
with
shaking
fingers
she
unfolded
her
handkerchief
and
laid
the
precious
slip
of
paper
in
general
clinton
s
hands
a
british
officer
who
is
a
prisoner
in
gave
me
this
he
was
captured
at
argenton
and
that
drawing
shows
what
he
learned
of
the
the
defenses
of
argenton
as
the
general
spoke
he
sat
down
at
his
desk
with
the
paper
quickly
spread
before
him
and
the
two
young
officers
with
one
accord
sprang
to
his
side
the
road
is
the
fortified
ridge
the
soldiers
are
the
batteries
he
explained
it
to
me
said
lucy
breathing
fast
the
general
wheeled
about
in
his
chair
and
looked
at
her
with
a
new
light
in
his
eyes
you
ve
done
us
a
good
turn
my
little
girl
he
exclaimed
and
reaching
for
lucy
s
hand
he
took
it
in
a
strong
clasp
you
are
of
the
sort
that
will
bring
victory
to
america
and
i
m
proud
of
you
lucy
s
heart
was
too
full
for
words
and
her
eyes
filled
up
with
sudden
smarting
tears
the
two
junior
officers
seeing
her
emotion
checked
and
cut
short
the
burst
of
generous
praise
that
rushed
to
their
lips
almost
at
once
the
general
continued
i
must
question
you
in
detail
before
any
use
can
be
made
of
this
plan
also
i
must
hear
how
you
got
out
of
the
town
but
first
i
will
let
you
dry
your
clothes
and
rest
a
little
you
have
done
enough
for
one
lucy
raised
her
head
dashing
the
tears
from
her
eyes
i
can
answer
any
questions
now
general
clinton
she
said
quickly
do
you
think
i
have
come
all
this
hard
way
and
almost
died
of
fear
to
go
and
rest
before
telling
you
all
i
can
don
t
think
of
me
or
anything
but
learning
what
you
want
to
her
firm
earnest
voice
and
the
steady
light
in
her
eyes
carried
reassurance
and
conviction
general
clinton
gave
a
nod
of
satisfaction
and
his
voice
as
he
ordered
lucy
to
take
a
seat
beside
him
told
her
that
her
answers
would
hold
a
new
weight
and
value
in
his
mind
my
only
fear
he
began
in
trusting
to
this
plan
you
have
brought
is
that
you
may
have
been
deceived
by
some
german
knave
who
was
this
officer
who
gave
you
the
information
captain
archibald
beattie
of
the
royal
infantry
he
is
a
prisoner
in
wheeler
said
the
general
turning
to
his
aide
where
is
that
british
liaison
officer
who
was
with
us
could
you
get
hold
of
him
yes
sir
he
is
right
in
the
other
farm
building
said
the
aide
saluting
find
one
of
our
officers
too
the
general
added
as
the
lieutenant
turned
to
leave
where
did
you
see
this
englishman
he
continued
facing
lucy
once
more
the
first
time
was
when
a
german
officer
made
me
interpret
for
him
what
captain
beattie
said
because
i
speak
a
little
german
after
he
was
in
the
old
town
prison
i
used
to
see
him
through
the
bars
of
his
window
he
gave
me
this
plan
in
case
i
should
ever
be
able
to
send
it
to
our
lines
i
missed
two
chances
in
succession
so
there
was
no
way
but
to
come
what
chances
could
you
have
had
my
brother
bob
landed
in
once
but
that
was
before
i
knew
about
the
hidden
guns
at
argenton
then
a
french
spy
got
into
the
town
but
i
failed
that
time
here
they
are
sir
said
the
other
lieutenant
going
toward
the
door
steps
sounded
outside
and
crossed
the
outer
room
the
aide
reappeared
with
two
officers
behind
him
one
was
a
tall
handsome
britisher
about
thirty
years
old
whose
face
was
so
strangely
familiar
to
lucy
that
she
stared
at
him
wonderingly
as
his
hand
rose
to
the
salute
but
the
impression
passed
for
he
bowed
to
her
without
recognition
before
the
general
had
more
than
spoken
a
word
of
greeting
the
second
officer
entered
the
room
and
stood
at
attention
then
at
sight
of
lucy
he
gave
a
gasp
of
such
surprise
as
almost
caused
him
to
forget
the
general
s
presence
lucy
lucy
gordon
you
are
free
he
cried
the
general
looked
up
sharply
you
know
her
then
and
you
miss
gordon
for
lucy
had
leaped
to
her
feet
to
hold
out
both
hands
to
the
young
officer
her
face
all
lighted
up
with
joyful
recognition
oh
yes
general
she
stammered
struggling
for
words
in
her
happiness
at
sight
of
this
friend
it
s
captain
harding
well
captain
harding
i
congratulate
you
on
your
friend
said
the
general
with
a
kindly
smile
this
young
lady
crossed
the
german
lines
to
bring
us
this
plan
of
the
argenton
defenses
i
will
ask
you
two
gentlemen
to
give
me
your
opinion
on
making
a
respectful
effort
to
hide
his
astonishment
and
to
silence
his
unbounded
admiration
captain
harding
bent
together
with
the
british
officer
over
the
little
paper
on
the
general
s
desk
now
miss
gordon
please
tell
us
again
about
that
british
officer
who
gave
you
this
plan
the
general
commanded
he
is
captain
archibald
beattie
royal
infantry
captured
at
argenton
on
may
lucy
repeated
beattie
exclaimed
the
british
liaison
officer
i
know
him
general
he
is
a
prisoner
yes
in
lucy
nodded
he
is
light
brown
hair
and
blue
eyes
and
a
little
scar
on
his
just
so
he
got
that
scar
from
a
grazing
bullet
at
ypres
if
this
plan
is
from
him
sir
it
s
trustworthy
why
that
s
his
writing
at
the
bottom
changing
the
guard
the
britisher
s
calm
face
had
grown
flushed
with
excitement
then
the
group
of
men
must
represent
batteries
yes
so
he
told
this
young
lady
what
part
of
the
ridge
would
that
be
harding
the
west
front
sir
where
the
concealed
batteries
are
the
main
front
captain
harding
exclaimed
overcome
with
joy
oh
sir
we
should
be
able
to
silence
those
guns
now
his
hand
behind
the
general
s
back
came
down
on
lucy
s
shoulder
with
a
pressure
that
would
have
been
painful
if
its
friendly
and
delightful
meaning
had
not
increased
her
happiness
oh
but
you
ve
done
a
good
piece
of
work
captain
lucy
i
always
knew
you
had
it
in
you
he
whispered
next
attack
we
had
the
general
was
saying
forgetting
herself
lucy
interrupted
him
oh
not
next
week
general
right
away
my
father
will
be
sent
into
germany
day
after
the
general
swung
around
in
his
chair
and
looked
at
her
with
keen
thoughtful
eyes
i
can
t
make
promises
he
said
at
last
but
if
any
one
has
deserved
to
have
her
father
saved
it
is
you
and
the
army
can
not
afford
to
lose
colonel
gordon
if
there
s
a
chance
of
reaching
him
tell
us
what
else
you
i
can
tell
you
the
weakest
point
in
the
line
before
captain
beattie
and
i
heard
two
german
soldiers
talking
about
it
outside
his
prison
window
but
he
knew
it
before
anyway
it
was
there
that
i
got
wheeler
bring
that
scale
map
and
put
it
on
the
desk
ordered
the
general
gentlemen
draw
up
and
miss
gordon
will
show
us
just
exactly
where
she
crossed
the
the
british
officer
rising
to
obey
this
invitation
held
out
his
hand
to
lucy
as
he
neared
the
desk
his
face
had
in
it
something
more
than
a
friendly
admiration
for
her
brave
exploit
i
want
to
congratulate
you
myself
lucy
gordon
he
said
i
m
your
cousin
i
m
janet
s
brother
arthur
chapter
xvi
the
yanks
are
coming
daybreak
of
the
morning
following
lucy
s
departure
from
colonel
gordon
awoke
to
the
boom
of
cannon
he
raised
his
head
listening
intently
in
a
moment
he
was
aware
that
the
fighting
had
recommenced
along
the
whole
front
he
guessed
that
the
bombardment
extended
from
argenton
as
far
south
as
cantigny
though
as
yet
the
lines
in
front
of
were
quiet
enough
he
rose
and
dressed
and
went
out
into
the
garden
the
sentry
glanced
at
him
with
a
look
of
surprise
and
annoyance
for
he
was
not
the
only
one
who
had
been
roused
by
the
guns
several
of
the
convalescents
were
strolling
about
the
garden
though
in
the
faint
light
of
a
foggy
dawn
colonel
gordon
could
distinguish
them
but
vaguely
neither
could
he
see
the
sky
beyond
the
town
but
the
fog
could
not
prevent
his
hearing
and
his
ears
told
him
much
the
bombardment
was
steadily
increasing
the
german
artillery
in
front
of
had
gone
into
action
now
and
the
vibrations
of
the
powerful
explosions
began
to
shake
the
air
from
the
distant
boom
of
the
guns
before
argenton
to
the
crash
of
those
but
a
mile
away
the
mighty
volume
of
sound
rolled
ever
increasingly
on
the
listeners
ears
as
colonel
gordon
stood
motionless
by
the
garden
wall
the
figure
of
a
french
officer
advanced
out
of
the
fog
and
came
to
his
side
colonel
said
his
fellow
prisoner
and
in
the
frenchman
s
voice
colonel
gordon
detected
something
of
the
longing
hope
that
was
stirring
his
own
heart
what
do
you
think
of
it
it
sounds
as
if
they
were
in
he
spoke
very
low
and
colonel
gordon
answered
him
as
softly
it
is
evident
that
the
allies
began
the
attack
i
m
sure
the
firing
commenced
from
our
own
lines
the
german
batteries
in
front
of
the
town
have
but
just
come
the
attack
appears
to
be
developing
on
our
is
not
directly
menaced
yet
i
fear
it
could
not
be
held
even
if
taken
while
the
enemy
holds
the
frenchman
s
eager
voice
had
grown
more
anxious
than
hopeful
as
the
situation
grew
clearer
to
his
mind
that
is
probable
enough
colonel
gordon
muttered
thoughtfully
but
captain
remy
i
think
the
americans
are
opposite
us
and
they
are
not
likely
to
attempt
an
advance
over
this
unknown
terrain
without
good
hope
of
colonel
gordon
was
not
at
heart
quite
as
confident
as
he
appeared
as
the
frenchman
easily
recognized
but
both
men
knew
the
value
of
a
little
optimism
and
captain
remy
allowed
himself
to
be
somewhat
encouraged
in
fact
notwithstanding
the
obstacle
of
argenton
s
formidable
defenses
the
thought
of
that
american
army
about
to
strike
with
all
the
ardor
of
its
growing
strength
and
determination
was
cause
for
hope
and
even
for
confidence
an
hour
passed
while
the
two
officers
stood
there
listening
in
silence
and
occasionally
exchanging
a
few
words
when
a
german
orderly
came
to
call
them
back
to
the
hospital
they
left
reluctantly
the
crash
of
the
guns
was
the
only
sound
they
cared
to
hear
just
then
and
the
only
sight
their
eyes
looked
for
the
dark
puffs
of
bursting
shells
in
the
sky
beyond
the
town
from
which
the
fog
had
begun
to
clear
away
inside
the
hospital
colonel
gordon
caught
sight
of
elizabeth
and
stopped
the
german
woman
on
her
hurried
way
across
the
ward
where
is
lucy
elizabeth
he
asked
she
is
usually
here
before
this
elizabeth
s
face
was
flushed
and
troubled
and
her
hands
began
clasping
each
other
nervously
colonel
gordon
thought
he
guessed
the
reason
for
her
uneasiness
convinced
as
he
was
of
his
old
servant
s
loyalty
to
the
allies
cause
he
could
not
but
suppose
that
her
feelings
would
undergo
some
conflict
on
the
eve
of
another
fight
elizabeth
stammered
a
little
as
she
answered
miss
lucy
not
yet
is
here
colonel
she
told
me
i
should
say
to
you
that
she
will
before
very
long
see
this
vague
reply
satisfied
colonel
gordon
for
the
moment
and
he
went
in
to
breakfast
still
deeply
thoughtful
over
the
commencing
battle
it
was
easy
to
see
that
every
one
in
the
hospital
shared
his
preoccupation
the
americans
and
their
allies
listened
to
the
roaring
cannon
with
eager
intent
faces
between
patients
and
nurses
many
a
hopeful
word
or
meaning
glance
was
exchanged
in
spite
of
german
doctors
and
orderlies
near
by
these
seemed
not
to
share
in
the
keen
interest
the
others
showed
they
looked
sullen
anxious
and
many
a
poor
french
or
american
soldier
was
roughly
handled
that
morning
by
a
german
orderly
who
saw
a
chance
to
vent
his
smouldering
resentment
by
no
stretch
of
imagination
could
any
german
in
see
a
cheerful
prospect
ahead
when
the
french
and
british
had
exacted
from
them
such
a
fearful
toll
during
the
progress
of
germany
s
victorious
spring
offensive
what
would
the
price
be
now
that
america
had
joined
the
ranks
of
the
allies
the
bombardment
had
grown
heavy
and
continuous
all
along
the
line
colonel
gordon
presently
started
back
to
the
garden
but
was
prevented
by
the
sentry
on
the
path
outside
who
shook
his
head
scowlingly
with
upraised
rifle
surprised
at
this
sudden
change
of
front
colonel
gordon
went
back
to
his
room
and
looked
out
of
the
main
window
toward
the
west
the
sky
was
filled
with
darting
airplanes
and
bursting
shrapnel
formed
countless
dark
spots
among
the
white
clouds
beyond
the
town
as
he
looked
the
scream
of
a
shell
drowned
for
a
moment
every
other
sound
the
next
instant
with
a
terrific
explosion
a
jet
of
earth
and
stone
rose
into
the
air
not
five
hundred
yards
distant
leaving
a
gaping
hole
in
the
street
leading
westward
from
the
hospital
colonel
gordon
turned
to
the
door
of
the
room
and
catching
sight
of
miss
pearse
motioned
quickly
to
her
the
big
ward
had
suddenly
taken
on
a
look
of
excitement
and
confusion
a
german
doctor
was
loudly
issuing
orders
right
and
left
miss
pearse
ran
to
colonel
gordon
s
side
her
face
reflecting
the
emotions
that
filled
her
heart
almost
to
bursting
at
that
moment
colonel
gordon
gave
her
no
time
to
speak
before
he
asked
sharply
where
is
lucy
why
isn
t
she
here
miss
pearse
gave
a
quick
sigh
as
though
she
had
nearly
reached
the
limit
of
endurance
she
drew
colonel
gordon
back
into
the
room
and
said
with
what
calmness
she
could
muster
i
will
have
to
tell
you
colonel
and
i
can
t
take
long
to
do
it
i
hope
and
believe
that
lucy
is
safely
inside
the
allies
where
what
gasped
colonel
gordon
stupefied
miss
pearse
took
lucy
s
note
from
her
apron
pocket
and
put
it
in
his
hands
that
will
tell
you
all
i
know
she
said
with
trembling
fingers
colonel
gordon
held
the
slip
of
paper
to
the
light
and
read
the
following
in
a
hurried
blotted
likeness
of
lucy
s
writing
dear
miss
pearse
i
am
going
to
try
to
cross
the
german
lines
to
take
captain
beattie
s
plan
to
the
allies
i
can
not
stay
here
and
see
father
sent
to
germany
i
know
a
the
château
perhaps
i
can
get
through
if
i
succeed
i
will
beg
the
american
commander
to
attack
at
once
pray
that
he
can
i
wrote
elizabeth
not
to
let
father
know
sooner
than
can
be
helped
you
too
please
don
t
tell
him
before
colonel
gordon
could
not
find
breath
to
speak
as
he
stood
staring
at
miss
pearse
in
horror
and
amazement
the
young
nurse
cried
in
an
agony
of
longing
oh
colonel
gordon
if
only
the
allies
could
take
the
town
the
germans
have
given
orders
to
evacuate
the
hospitals
they
are
taking
out
the
german
patients
now
and
in
another
hour
the
rest
must
her
voice
shook
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
as
they
met
his
with
a
look
of
almost
hopeless
misery
but
in
the
same
moment
she
wiped
the
tears
away
and
turned
back
to
the
ward
to
resume
her
share
of
the
tremendous
task
colonel
gordon
stood
motionless
where
she
had
left
him
then
his
thoughts
a
little
collected
he
glanced
sharply
out
into
the
hurry
and
movement
of
the
ward
where
the
work
of
evacuation
had
begun
he
sprang
toward
the
window
once
more
trying
to
learn
something
of
the
battle
s
progress
amidst
the
roar
of
the
artillery
a
german
regiment
was
running
along
the
street
toward
the
west
making
its
utmost
speed
among
the
impeding
stones
and
rubbish
the
shells
no
longer
fell
near
by
he
could
hear
them
screaming
over
the
town
but
they
fell
short
of
the
centre
avoiding
the
hospitals
and
searching
out
the
german
main
headquarters
and
supply
depot
behind
the
trenches
he
thought
the
two
airplanes
circling
far
overhead
were
accountable
for
this
change
the
sentry
had
deserted
the
garden
to
help
in
the
interior
of
the
hospital
and
ambulances
were
drawn
up
outside
the
doors
and
the
german
wounded
had
begun
to
be
carried
out
colonel
gordon
entered
the
ward
and
finding
himself
unobserved
in
the
general
confusion
went
out
into
the
garden
and
from
there
to
the
street
beyond
the
regiment
had
passed
and
the
street
was
deserted
he
glanced
back
and
saw
that
the
angle
of
the
hospital
wall
hid
him
from
the
group
about
the
ambulances
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
began
to
run
in
the
direction
of
the
firing
not
far
from
the
street
which
lucy
had
followed
to
the
château
hill
the
night
before
he
stopped
breathing
a
little
hard
after
his
enforced
idleness
of
the
past
weeks
the
chief
reason
for
his
pause
however
was
the
change
in
the
noise
of
the
attack
which
became
distinguishable
to
his
ears
as
he
drew
nearer
the
of
machine
guns
and
rifle
fire
was
plainly
audible
in
the
midst
of
the
bombardment
it
came
from
his
left
the
direction
of
the
hill
he
ran
forward
again
until
between
the
houses
he
could
obtain
a
distant
view
of
the
hillside
the
fog
had
now
lifted
from
all
but
the
lowlands
and
at
the
sight
which
met
his
eyes
he
gave
a
shout
of
amazement
and
exultation
all
over
the
behind
the
château
men
were
advancing
in
skirmish
line
now
they
ran
on
a
few
steps
now
dropped
to
earth
or
fell
back
before
a
sudden
onset
from
the
enemy
concealed
in
the
woods
in
front
of
them
while
the
bursting
flame
from
machine
guns
the
volleys
of
musketry
fire
and
the
gaps
opening
in
the
thinning
ranks
announced
a
bitter
and
desperate
struggle
it
could
mean
but
one
thing
the
german
line
still
held
before
but
at
this
the
extreme
southern
point
of
the
town
it
had
been
broken
by
a
bold
surprise
colonel
gordon
stood
staring
toward
the
hill
convincing
himself
of
the
truth
of
what
he
saw
while
his
heart
throbbed
with
triumph
every
nerve
in
his
body
rebelled
at
remaining
an
idle
spectator
to
that
thrilling
and
unequal
conflict
barely
two
companies
of
americans
had
breasted
the
hill
from
the
swampy
land
below
and
they
had
all
they
could
do
to
hold
their
own
at
that
moment
he
heard
the
thud
of
footsteps
behind
him
and
glanced
quickly
back
a
german
infantry
column
making
toward
the
front
was
debouching
from
a
street
on
his
right
the
foremost
officer
gave
one
look
at
the
uniformed
american
and
sent
a
shot
from
his
pistol
at
colonel
gordon
s
breast
the
bullet
whizzed
by
his
shoulder
and
a
second
kicked
up
the
dust
behind
him
for
he
did
not
wait
to
furnish
a
target
to
the
german
captain
those
shots
more
than
anything
else
added
to
the
strength
and
ardor
of
his
purpose
the
german
thought
him
a
combatant
and
a
combatant
he
was
from
that
instant
he
had
slipped
around
the
corner
of
the
church
at
the
head
of
the
street
leading
to
the
hill
once
out
of
sight
of
his
enemy
who
was
leading
his
men
on
too
desperate
an
errand
to
turn
aside
in
pursuit
he
ran
on
until
the
road
sloped
upward
the
american
shells
had
penetrated
this
far
before
the
infantry
had
advanced
to
climb
the
hillside
under
cover
of
the
fog
right
before
him
gaped
a
huge
whose
flying
earth
had
partly
concealed
a
shattered
german
machine
gun
with
the
crew
lying
dead
beside
it
colonel
gordon
bent
over
one
of
the
dead
soldiers
seized
the
pistol
from
his
holster
and
unbuckled
his
in
another
second
he
stood
up
no
longer
unarmed
and
defenseless
with
every
pulse
on
fire
though
his
brain
remained
keen
and
watchful
he
ran
on
toward
the
hill
to
skirt
its
northern
side
would
be
to
run
full
into
the
german
trenches
any
way
was
perilous
enough
but
he
was
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
ground
it
was
the
same
over
which
he
had
advanced
six
weeks
before
to
victory
he
could
not
linger
at
the
base
of
the
hill
either
where
bodies
of
troops
might
be
met
with
at
any
moment
just
now
he
saw
only
a
straggling
group
of
women
and
children
fleeing
from
a
cottage
toward
the
town
he
plunged
into
the
wood
and
began
mounting
the
hill
among
the
thick
growth
of
pines
while
above
him
increased
the
hammer
of
fire
the
rattle
of
musketry
and
the
shouts
of
furious
men
the
hillside
up
which
he
climbed
was
deserted
the
germans
had
gone
to
the
defense
of
the
position
by
way
of
the
trenches
and
though
already
driven
back
to
seek
cover
in
the
woods
they
had
not
yet
retreated
down
the
slope
as
he
neared
the
crest
colonel
gordon
crept
cautiously
up
behind
a
rock
which
overhung
the
hillside
and
breathing
fast
crouched
low
to
peer
out
from
its
concealing
shelter
directly
in
front
of
him
about
twenty
yards
away
soldiers
were
falling
back
in
disorder
though
firing
as
they
retired
in
a
moment
they
were
almost
at
the
rock
s
level
and
now
the
americans
burst
out
from
the
lingering
fog
wreaths
among
the
pines
pursuing
the
demoralized
foe
at
the
point
of
the
bayonet
colonel
gordon
started
up
from
the
ground
victory
the
one
thought
in
his
exultant
heart
at
that
instant
a
sharp
command
rang
out
from
the
trees
on
his
right
before
it
died
away
a
heavy
was
discharged
on
the
flank
of
the
advancing
americans
a
dozen
of
whom
fell
forward
in
the
midst
of
their
triumphant
charge
he
knew
in
a
second
what
had
happened
german
reinforcements
had
crept
up
by
the
road
which
wound
about
the
hillside
the
swift
retreat
of
the
germans
defending
the
hill
was
playing
into
the
very
hands
of
these
newcomers
who
had
the
surprised
americans
for
the
moment
at
their
mercy
an
american
soldier
pitching
forward
as
he
fell
rolled
down
to
the
rock
close
by
colonel
gordon
s
side
he
was
already
dead
colonel
gordon
saw
the
gaping
wound
in
his
temple
and
in
the
same
glance
he
read
the
number
on
his
insignia
these
men
were
from
his
own
regiment
in
that
breath
of
time
that
he
had
remained
inactive
his
mind
had
been
desperately
planning
how
to
make
the
most
of
the
help
he
could
offer
now
he
hesitated
no
longer
a
captain
frantically
trying
to
rally
his
men
to
withstand
the
flank
attack
of
twice
their
own
number
fell
dead
in
the
act
of
urging
on
his
company
their
leader
shot
down
a
murderous
fire
cutting
their
ranks
to
pieces
for
an
instant
the
men
wavered
at
that
moment
there
appeared
in
front
of
them
the
tall
figure
of
an
officer
bareheaded
a
pistol
in
his
upraised
hand
there
was
no
time
to
express
any
of
the
emotions
which
seized
the
soldiers
bewildered
minds
at
sight
of
their
lost
commander
a
bullet
struck
colonel
gordon
in
the
arm
but
he
did
not
feel
it
his
voice
ringing
out
clear
strong
and
confident
in
the
midst
of
death
and
confusion
cried
forward
men
of
the
follow
me
it
was
all
they
needed
what
were
overwhelming
odds
with
that
familiar
figure
leading
them
to
victory
a
cheer
that
shook
the
enemy
s
sense
of
easy
triumph
burst
from
their
panting
throats
colonel
gordon
was
no
longer
alone
for
the
whole
company
had
sprung
to
his
side
a
solid
volley
met
the
german
attack
and
then
in
the
face
of
a
rain
of
bullets
the
americans
charged
the
germans
saw
that
hedge
of
bayonets
rushing
down
upon
them
and
commenced
to
give
way
a
little
trained
fighters
as
they
were
they
could
not
stand
before
that
onslaught
leaping
down
the
slope
between
the
trees
and
over
rocks
and
brushwood
the
americans
came
irresistibly
on
the
germans
retiring
faster
now
scowled
in
sullen
rage
at
this
enemy
who
advanced
shouting
against
such
withering
fire
their
eyes
aflame
with
the
eager
light
of
victory
as
they
neared
the
foot
of
the
hill
the
german
fire
had
almost
ceased
hand
to
hand
the
men
of
the
and
their
enemy
continued
the
bitter
struggle
now
more
americans
had
reached
the
from
the
château
and
while
some
remained
to
lend
aid
to
those
men
of
the
who
had
fought
as
others
came
bounding
down
the
hill
their
help
was
welcome
but
the
fight
was
already
won
a
hundred
survivors
of
the
two
hundred
men
who
had
followed
colonel
gordon
down
the
hill
faced
the
shattered
remnant
of
the
german
reinforcing
column
those
of
the
enemy
who
managed
to
escape
alive
or
uncaptured
fled
into
the
town
through
which
at
news
of
the
broken
line
the
german
troops
from
the
trenches
in
front
of
could
be
seen
retreating
in
disorder
two
officers
reaching
colonel
gordon
s
side
seized
hold
of
him
and
cried
inaudible
words
of
astonishment
and
joy
through
the
rattle
of
musketry
and
the
shouts
around
them
but
their
faces
spoke
plainly
enough
one
thing
colonel
gordon
knew
in
that
glorious
moment
even
before
the
silencing
of
the
artillery
fire
confirmed
it
was
in
the
hands
of
the
allies
the
american
regiments
now
poured
unimpeded
down
the
hillside
road
hoping
to
take
the
fleeing
germans
on
the
flank
or
rear
a
thought
struck
colonel
gordon
in
the
midst
of
his
joy
to
a
signal
officer
pausing
beside
him
the
vanguard
of
the
new
communication
lines
he
asked
hurriedly
can
we
hold
the
town
major
it
s
a
regular
pocket
how
far
does
our
advance
extend
can
we
hold
it
repeated
the
officer
with
triumph
in
his
voice
colonel
we
entered
argenton
an
hour
ago
before
passing
on
he
pointed
to
colonel
gordon
s
left
sleeve
it
was
stained
with
blood
and
the
elder
officer
noticing
for
the
first
time
his
wounded
arm
found
that
it
hung
powerless
by
his
side
lucy
and
her
mother
were
in
the
little
hospital
at
cantigny
when
the
news
reached
them
lucy
had
been
sent
there
by
general
clinton
to
rest
after
her
fatigue
of
the
night
before
and
it
was
captain
harding
who
had
instantly
sent
word
to
gordon
at
nine
the
morning
of
the
advance
gordon
reached
cantigny
and
ten
minutes
later
lucy
s
arms
were
around
her
mother
s
neck
and
all
the
suffering
and
anxiety
of
the
past
two
months
seemed
to
slip
like
a
heavy
burden
from
her
shoulders
she
was
free
and
her
mother
was
with
longer
to
be
tormented
with
fears
for
her
safety
after
the
first
happy
moments
all
their
thoughts
turned
to
bob
and
colonel
gordon
and
to
the
battle
now
raging
which
would
decide
fate
they
had
not
long
to
spend
in
uncertainty
for
that
morning
events
moved
quickly
gordon
saw
from
the
window
a
soldier
running
up
the
hospital
steps
i
wonder
what
news
he
has
lucy
she
said
her
voice
shaking
with
mingled
hope
and
fear
the
next
moment
the
door
of
the
little
room
opened
and
a
nurse
whose
shining
eyes
and
radiant
face
spoke
plainer
than
words
ran
in
and
handed
gordon
a
folded
paper
a
soldier
brought
it
she
explained
darting
out
again
i
haven
t
time
to
gordon
unfolded
the
paper
and
together
she
and
lucy
devoured
the
few
lines
we
have
won
argenton
has
fallen
follows
the
guns
were
still
thundering
a
few
miles
away
and
at
that
distance
neither
lucy
nor
her
mother
distinguished
the
slackening
of
the
fire
they
could
not
sit
quietly
any
longer
and
going
into
the
wards
they
joined
in
the
general
rejoicing
oh
lucy
it
s
too
good
to
be
true
gordon
exclaimed
a
dozen
times
over
now
if
only
i
can
see
bob
and
father
they
went
out
into
the
streets
of
cantigny
and
it
was
in
front
of
the
brick
house
which
was
the
staff
headquarters
in
the
town
that
lucy
caught
sight
of
general
clinton
he
was
standing
by
a
big
military
automobile
the
door
of
which
his
aide
lieutenant
wheeler
was
holding
open
at
thought
of
what
the
general
had
done
for
her
in
trusting
to
captain
beattie
s
plan
and
ordering
the
advance
lucy
s
eyes
as
they
were
raised
to
his
filled
up
with
quick
grateful
tears
at
that
moment
he
turned
and
saw
the
young
girl
watching
him
he
gave
her
one
sharp
glance
and
leaving
the
car
came
forward
to
her
side
with
a
bow
to
gordon
he
held
out
his
hand
shake
hands
lucy
gordon
he
said
his
grave
face
lighting
with
keen
satisfaction
we
ve
won
and
your
brave
act
made
victory
possible
our
troops
occupy
argenton
and
as
lucy
too
overcome
to
speak
put
her
hand
in
his
with
burning
cheeks
and
wildly
beating
heart
he
turned
quickly
to
his
aide
any
empty
seats
in
that
other
car
wheeler
i
know
this
girl
and
her
mother
are
anxious
to
get
to
yes
sir
there
is
plenty
of
room
responded
the
young
officer
with
alacrity
he
led
the
way
to
a
second
machine
while
the
general
stepped
into
his
own
before
lucy
could
find
words
to
thank
him
it
was
almost
noon
when
lucy
and
her
mother
entered
the
automobiles
of
general
clinton
s
staff
made
a
slow
way
among
the
soldiers
and
civilians
crowding
the
once
desolate
streets
in
cheering
throngs
the
poor
townspeople
had
robbed
their
little
gardens
to
shower
the
victorious
troops
with
lilacs
and
roses
cries
of
friendly
greeting
filled
the
air
on
every
side
and
general
clinton
advanced
to
joyful
shouts
of
l
amérique
vive
nos
libérateurs
a
shower
of
rose
petals
fell
in
lucy
s
lap
and
gazing
about
her
with
wide
unbelieving
eyes
she
caught
her
breath
in
a
quick
sob
too
many
feelings
struggled
in
her
heart
for
any
connected
thought
most
of
all
she
longed
to
see
her
father
and
know
that
he
was
safe
they
neared
the
old
town
hall
no
longer
a
hospital
since
the
german
evacuation
and
bearing
signs
of
their
rage
for
destruction
in
the
heaps
of
torn
mattresses
and
broken
furniture
flung
outside
the
doors
into
the
street
american
soldiers
were
hurriedly
restoring
things
to
order
for
the
allies
wounded
had
been
removed
to
the
french
hospital
and
here
were
to
be
general
clinton
s
headquarters
for
the
time
being
even
before
they
drew
up
in
front
of
the
old
building
lucy
recognized
some
familiar
faces
among
the
group
of
officers
gathered
in
the
doorway
they
had
preceded
the
general
from
cantigny
to
establish
his
headquarters
and
now
came
forward
to
receive
him
a
few
doctors
and
nurses
too
were
among
them
lucy
scanned
each
face
with
eager
eyes
for
bob
had
flown
into
immediately
after
the
german
retreat
in
search
of
his
father
and
she
and
her
mother
waited
to
hear
from
him
of
colonel
gordon
s
safety
major
arthur
leslie
was
standing
in
the
road
talking
with
a
young
british
officer
lucy
s
throbbing
heart
gave
a
bound
as
she
saw
captain
beattie
s
face
the
look
of
cold
defiance
with
which
he
had
faced
his
bitter
melancholy
of
his
days
in
prison
had
utterly
vanished
and
he
looked
like
a
happy
boy
as
arthur
leslie
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
and
shook
his
hands
in
joyful
greeting
at
that
instant
lucy
caught
sight
of
bob
from
behind
a
little
group
of
men
the
next
she
sprang
from
the
automobile
and
ran
across
the
street
for
colonel
gordon
his
left
arm
closely
bandaged
was
standing
at
bob
s
side
five
minutes
later
when
the
gordons
had
begun
to
realize
the
wonderful
and
happy
truth
that
they
were
reunited
general
clinton
made
his
way
from
among
his
aides
to
colonel
gordon
s
side
he
held
out
his
hand
to
the
wounded
officer
glancing
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
faces
before
him
with
real
sympathy
in
his
shrewd
understanding
eyes
i
congratulate
you
on
your
gallant
service
he
said
with
simple
directness
it
shall
not
be
forgotten
rather
general
gordon
he
corrected
your
son
has
no
doubt
told
you
that
you
were
awarded
that
rank
a
month
in
the
same
breath
he
turned
to
bob
with
hand
again
you
too
deserve
than
i
can
offer
what
does
he
mean
bob
lucy
whispered
when
general
clinton
had
turned
to
speak
to
gordon
bob
had
lost
for
a
moment
his
dignity
and
was
looking
flushed
and
boyish
with
so
many
eyes
fixed
upon
him
my
promotion
i
suppose
he
explained
a
little
huskily
i
m
a
will
be
but
that
s
not
all
interrupted
arthur
leslie
smiling
at
bob
s
confusion
he
hasn
t
told
you
that
he
is
recommended
for
decoration
by
both
french
and
american
lucy
thought
her
heart
was
too
full
for
any
more
emotion
but
the
next
minute
she
heard
general
clinton
saying
we
expected
your
devoted
service
general
gordon
and
your
son
s
as
well
but
we
had
no
claim
on
your
daughter
s
yet
she
has
given
all
she
had
of
resourcefulness
and
bravery
to
the
common
cause
she
deserves
a
reward
as
much
as
any
soldier
lucy
could
not
have
spoken
a
word
in
the
midst
of
her
happiness
without
bursting
into
childish
tears
she
wanted
to
explain
captain
beattie
s
part
in
her
success
more
than
anything
she
hoped
the
general
understood
how
complete
her
reward
was
in
seeing
honors
heaped
upon
those
she
loved
so
dearly
he
s
right
it
s
you
who
deserve
it
all
bob
whispered
in
her
ear
unable
to
stay
quietly
where
she
was
with
such
hot
cheeks
and
pounding
heart
she
edged
her
way
toward
the
door
when
an
officer
had
drawn
general
clinton
to
one
side
out
in
the
street
the
cool
air
touched
her
face
gratefully
at
that
moment
she
thought
of
elizabeth
longing
to
see
her
again
in
this
triumphant
hour
was
lucy
s
fifteenth
birthday
and
elizabeth
in
the
midst
of
their
fears
of
the
past
weeks
had
promised
lucy
a
present
in
one
of
her
kind
efforts
to
cheer
the
anxious
girl
from
her
growing
depression
lucy
eagerly
questioned
the
people
around
her
but
without
avail
there
s
not
a
german
left
in
captain
harding
told
her
when
she
explained
to
him
the
object
of
her
search
elizabeth
must
have
gone
on
with
the
german
wounded
from
the
hospital
we
advanced
before
they
could
force
our
own
people
to
for
a
moment
a
cloud
dimmed
lucy
s
happiness
was
she
not
to
see
that
faithful
friend
again
after
those
dreadful
weeks
of
captivity
did
elizabeth
mean
to
vanish
from
now
that
her
work
there
was
ended
before
she
could
answer
her
own
doubts
she
caught
sight
of
old
clemence
standing
with
michelle
at
the
edge
of
the
little
crowd
michelle
s
eyes
were
raised
to
meet
her
own
and
lucy
saw
that
the
french
girl
s
lovely
face
was
transfigured
as
captain
beattie
s
had
been
with
the
glad
light
of
freedom
the
look
of
scornful
rebellion
had
left
her
eyes
and
the
sad
curve
of
her
lips
had
changed
to
a
serene
smile
of
happiness
lucy
seized
both
her
hands
in
a
clasp
that
said
more
than
the
few
halting
words
in
which
she
tried
to
express
their
rejoicing
michelle
had
not
managed
to
respond
much
either
except
with
her
shining
eyes
when
a
wild
cheer
rising
on
every
side
caused
the
two
girls
to
look
quickly
around
caps
were
snatched
off
and
flung
in
the
air
the
remaining
flowers
were
pelted
at
the
officers
in
the
doorway
by
children
shouting
themselves
hoarse
in
jubilation
all
eyes
were
turned
toward
the
roof
of
the
old
town
hall
of
willing
hands
had
raised
two
poles
between
the
pointed
towers
and
now
from
the
roof
side
by
side
with
the
heroic
tricolor
there
floated
the
