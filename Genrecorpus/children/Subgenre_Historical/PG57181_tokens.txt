s
preface
not
to

but
to

negroes
should
find
great
pride
indeed
in
race
progress
herein
they
read
but
to
such
readers
let
me
tell
this
book
means
not
our
heads
to
swell
for
five
of
the
greatest
rich
white
men
could
buy
the
wealth
of
our
race
and
then
so
this
book
is
neither
a
brag
nor
boast
but
just
to
inspire
our
younger
host
to
elevate
their
racial
name
from
poisoned
stains
of
slavery
shame
by
climbing
to
the
highest
heights
thro
aid
of
friends
who
are
real
whites
years
ago
when
a
lad
fifteen
years
old
attending
the
public
schools
of
pennsylvania
in
which
state
i
was
born
and
reared
certain
ideas
and
sentiments
caused
me
to
secretly
resolve
that
some
day
when
i
had
gotten
together
the
necessary
data
i
would
write
just
such
a
book
as
is
contained
herein
at
the
time
that
resolution
was
formed
i
was
attending
the
darlington
school
in
middletown
district
delaware
county
over
which
smith
was
superintendent
and
i
remember
with
much
gratefulness
my
first
and
last
public
school
teachers
misses
carrie
hamilton
and
rebecca
crumley
and
smith
for
their
kind
and
frequent
words
to
me
as
encouragement
to
continue
my
education
after
graduating
from
the
public
schools
my
favorite
study
was
the
united
states
history
and
even
at
the
tender
age
of
fifteen
years
i
was
greatly
surprised
and
race
pridely
hurt
not
to
find
any
history
except
about
slavery
in
such
books
concerning
the
american
negro
i
had
such
childish
confidence
in
my
school
books
and
their
authors
that
i
felt
sure
if
negroes
had
fought
and
died
in
the
several
american
wars
had
become
great
poets
orators
artists
sculptors
the
histories
i
was
studying
would
have
mentioned
such
i
thought
in
doing
that
they
would
have
been
preserving
united
states
valuable
history
more
so
than
merely
giving
just
credit
to
the
colored
people
who
had
made
such
history
i
did
not
know
that
right
then
the
attentions
of
many
public
school
children
in
far
away
europe
were
often
called
to
the
histories
of
such
distinguished
colored
americans
as
phyllis
wheatley
the
poetess
frederick
douglas
the
orator
henry
tanner
the
artist
edmonia
lewis
the
sculptoress
all
of
them
having
won
recognition
and
fame
in
europe
as
well
as
in
america
my
youthful
ignorance
regarding
the
achievements
of
my
race
is
easily
explained
when
it
is
taken
into
consideration
that
i
was
a
farmer
boy
living
far
from
libraries
i
had
never
seen
and
negro
histories
i
had
never
heard
about
and
the
united
states
histories
then
used
in
the
public
schools
had
nothing
in
them
to
enlighten
me
on
that
subject
they
misled
and
kept
me
along
with
thousands
of
other
colored
school
children
in
absolute
ignorance
relative
to
the
progress
and
attainments
of
the
american
colored
people
so
whenever
our
history
classes
went
up
to
recite
and
my
white
classmates
proudly
went
through
the
lessons
about
general
george
washington
noah
webster
benjamin
franklin
eli
whitney
longfellow
while
i
knew
and
could
just
as
easily
recite
such
history
nevertheless
my
feelings
of
crushed
race
pride
and
mortification
were
beyond
expression
because
not
one
thing
could
i
proudly
recite
from
my
lessons
about
great
things
my
people
had
accomplished
in
america
it
is
the
same
with
the
united
states
histories
used
in
our
public
schools
of
today
they
do
not
relate
about
crispus
attucks
a
negro
soldier
and
the
first
colonist
martyr
to
give
his
life
for
america
in
the
revolutionary
war
nor
about
the
colored
sailor
william
tillman
who
received
six
thousand
dollars
from
the
federal
government
for
recapturing
a
stolen
schooner
from
the
rebels
in
the
civil
war
nor
about
the
colored
registrars
of
the
united
states
treasury
bruce
lyons
vernon
and
napier
whose
names
during
different
administrations
covering
a
period
of
more
than
thirty
years
appeared
on
all
the
united
states
paper
money
made
and
issued
during
that
period
nor
about
matthew
henson
who
was
with
commodore
peary
when
he
peary
discovered
the
north
pole
nor
about
booker
washington
one
of
the
greatest
orators
america
has
ever
produced
and
also
builder
of
one
of
the
most
famous
institutions
of
learning
not
only
in
america
but
in
the
world
as
i
said
before
i
knew
nothing
about
such
negro
history
while
i
was
a
farmer
s
boy
but
i
could
never
quite
rid
myself
of
a
feeling
that
the
colored
people
in
the
united
states
did
have
a
worthy
history
i
studied
the
white
man
s
history
from
cover
to
cover
and
learned
all
i
could
from
it
but
i
got
no
more
racial
inspiration
from
it
than
a
white
boy
would
get
from
studying
only
a
negro
history
in
which
nothing
was
written
about
his
own
racial
achievements
so
i
secretly
resolved
to
immediately
begin
to
quietly
and
patiently
research
for
american
negro
data
in
order
to
some
day
publish
a
book
so
that
future
colored
school
children
would
not
be
kept
in
ignorance
about
their
own
race
history
i
felt
it
was
perfectly
right
and
necessary
to
study
the
white
man
s
history
at
the
school
desks
but
if
colored
children
were
not
permitted
to
study
the
history
of
their
own
race
at
the
same
desks
it
was
perfectly
right
and
necessary
that
colored
children
learn
about
the
achievements
of
their
great
men
and
women
at
their
home
firesides
within
their
family
circles
so
for
the
benefit
mostly
of
colored
youths
here
are
the
crude
results
of
my
boyhood
resolutions
and
manhood
efforts
after
years
filled
with
trying
discouragements
and
bitter
disappointments
but
also
just
as
full
of
unswerving
determinations
constant
hopefulness
upward
climbs
ceaseless
works
and
fervent
prayers
to
god
to
succeed
the
author
wishes
to
use
this
place
and
opportunity
to
express
his
deepest
thanks
to
the
more
than
one
hundred
prominent
colored
men
and
women
living
in
as
many
large
cities
in
all
parts
of
the
united
states
who
so
friendly
sent
to
him
information
regarding
the
progress
and
success
of
colored
people
in
those
cities
for
the
unusual
generosity
and
kindness
in
giving
of
their
valuable
time
to
personally
and
helpfully
send
to
him
exceptionally
fitting

as
the
results
of
those
and
many
other

being
later
captured
and
forcibly
brought
to
america
real
slavery
was
finally
started
and
spread
so
rapidly
that
there
were
about
four
million
slaves
in
the
united
states
by
january
at
that
time
all
the
slaves
in
the
rebel
states
were
set
free
by
the
emancipation
proclamation
of
president
abraham
lincoln
who
was
later
murdered
for
that
godly
act
by
one
of
his
own
race
but
today
abraham
lincoln
is
remembered
in
all
civilized
countries
as
one
of
the
greatest
among
the
greatest
men
the
world
has
ever
known
as
the
noblest
president
who
has
ever
governed
the
united
states
and
as
the
truest
and
most
white
friend
the
negro
race
has
ever
had
on
december
the
adoption
of
the
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
gave
freedom
to
the
remaining
slaves
who
lived
in
the
states
that
had
not
rebelled
against
the
union
thus
in
these
two
legal
ways
that
were
made
possible
by
the
northern
states
winning
the
civil
war
were
all
the
slaves
in
the
united
states
of
america
set
free
when
the
few
white
people
in
the
early
colonies
stopped
to
realize
that
the
first
african
people
who
arrived
were
not
used
to
america
s
new
foods
unusual
hard
work
cold
changeable
climates
and
were
without
a
knowledge
of
the
white
man
s
language
habits
and
religion
it
is
no
great
wonder
why
that
small
portion
of
justice
thinking
white
people
so
readily
saw
unusual
good
qualities
and
latent
talents
in
a
group
of
supposed
brainless
heathens
who
so
quickly
peacefully
and
profitably
stepped
from
the
narrow
paths
of
african
savagery
into
the
broad
avenues
of
american
civilization
but
the
large
numbers
of
people
who
then
as
now
tried
so
hard
to
make
themselves
and
others
believe
that
negroes
were
inferior
human
beings
to
themselves
put
forth
the
explanation
that
the
remarkable
and
rapid
adjustments
of
the
slaves
to
american
surroundings
were
due
to
their
childlike
dispositions
to
imitate
actions
to
humbly
obey
orders
and
their
great
physical
strength
to
do
all
kinds
of
hard
work
at
all
times
under
all
conditions
such
people
were
entirely
wrong
in
such
ideas
just
as
all
prejudiced
ideas
keep
their
owners
wrong
mean
and
in
the
lowest
stages
of
human
society
when
men
and
women
allow
their
minds
to
become
poisoned
with
hateful
envious
and
jealous
prejudice
toward
other
people
and
refuse
to
have
anything
to
do
with
them
because
they
are
colored
they
have
and
show
just
about
as
much
greatness
in
good
taste
and
good
as
if
they
were
to
refuse
to
puff
on
their
favorite
brand
of
havana
cigars
or
to
nibble
on
one
of
huyler
s
famed
chocolate
just
because
the
cigar
and
are
of
rich
brown
colors
such
actions
do
not
make
people
great
except
in
their
own
little
social
circles
and
when
they
leave
home
and
go
out
into
the
world
to
mingle
among
highly
educated
and
people
prejudiced
men
and
women
soon
find
that
their
supposed
greatness
along
side
of
for
instance
an
abraham
lincoln
or
a
harriet
beecher
stowe
a
is
as
large
as
a
grain
of
sand
is
along
side
of
a
mountain
if
president
lincoln
had
not
preserved
the
union
and
signed
the
emancipation
proclamation
or
if
stowe
had
not
written
uncle
tom
s
cabin
a
but
instead
both
had
turned
up
their
noses
in
disdain
tossed
their
heads
in
haughty
proudness
and
snobbishly
spurned
and
intelligent
people
just
because
of
their
colors
the
names
of
lincoln
and
stowe
in
stead
of
now
being
enshrined
in
the
hall
of
fame
and
written
in
the
world
s
history
ever
to
be
remembered
and
beloved
by
all
nations
would
have
been
buried
and
forgotten
a
few
years
after
their
owners
had
died
as
is
the
case
with
the
names
of
all
race
prejudiced
people
but
this
point
regarding
the
utter
foolishness
and
ignorance
of
people
showing
race
prejudice
was
much
more
ably
and
vividly
brought
out
in
one
of
mckay
s
bull
and
pictures
that
appear
in
the
sunday
issues
of
the
new
york
american
one
among
several
such
big
white
journals
from
which
the
writer
derives
new
inspiration
and
increased
knowledge
every
sunday
this
picture
and
editorial
in
question
that
described
the
namaqua
savage
tribe
of
negroes
living
in
the
african
jungles
were
printed
in
the
march
issue
of
the
new

american

the

is
an
extract
from
that
article
titled
shooting

the
the
savages
of
africa

first
of
all
to
fight
and
conquer
the
burning

hence
the
black
skin
that
keeps
off
the
deadly
actinic
rays
that
would
quickly
destroy
any
white
race
in
their
climate
and
the
thick
woolly
hair
saturated
with
grease
protecting
the
skull
from
the
heat
and
the
deadly
effect
of
those
same
rays
as
we
think
of
different
kinds
of
human
beings
let
us
judge
them
by
the
conditions
under
which
they
live
whether
they
be
eskimos
near
the
north
pole
or
men
like
these
namaquas
at
the
equator
ignorance
is
horrified
at
the
eskimo
eating
enormous
quantities
of
rank
fat
whale
blubber
any
race
transferred
to
the
arctic
circle
would
do
that
or
die
ignorance
despises
the
black
skin
and
woolly
hair
of
the
african
any
white
race
transferred
to
the
african
tropics
would
develop
such
skin
and

or
it
would
die
understand
what
you
are
discussing
as
far
as
possible
before
discussing
it
an
eagle
can
not
understand
a
turtle
or
a
turtle
an
eagle
and
a
cow
mildly
grazing
can
not
understand
either
every
human
being
that
despises
another
no
matter
what
the
other
may
be
simply
represents
the
animal
expression
of
prejudice
based
on
now
the
real
truth
as
to
how
those
strange
and
friendless
slaves
were
able
to
so
readily
adapt
themselves
to
this
country
and
so
aptly
adopt
the
methods
and
customs
of
the
colonists
is
that
from
mere
force
of
habits
they
put
into
their
everyday
lives
their
inherited
qualities
of
trustworthiness
and
undying
hopefulness
these
qualities
in
which
all
civilized
countries
of
today
stand
badly
in
need
of
a
much
broader
growth
and
a
higher
culture
had
been
handed
down
to
the
american
slaves
by
their
african
forefathers
who
had
for
centuries
dwelt
in
the
darkest
and
wildest
torrid
jungles
without
a
knowledge
of
the
white
man
s
civilization
and
those
black
ancestors
had
passed
to
their
suffering
offsprings
such
full
portions
of
the
above
named
manhood
and
brotherhood
principles
that
the
slaves
were
able
as
they
pitifully
and
tearfully
went
back
and
forth
to
their
and
tasks
to
shame
by
their
unspiteful
and
unrevengeful
actions
under
such
cruel
treatments
just
a
little
measure
of
their
inherited
virtues
into
the
civilized
educated
and
christian
white
people
who
held
them
in
bondage
it
must
be
granted
that
their
owners
did
teach
the
slaves
whose
foreparents
had
lived
in
a
very
hot
country
where
little
clothing
was
needed
and
food
was
plentiful
without
working
for
it
how
to
properly
dress
and
how
to
regularly
work
and
although
those
enslaved
people
were
taught
those
good
habits
only
as
means
for
their
selfish
and
greedy
owners
to
enable
themselves
to
get
richer
nevertheless
the
colored
people
of
are
glad
and
thankful
that
they
are
now
able
to
turn
to
their
own
personal
and
racial
advantages
the
industrial
habits
learned
by
their
people
in
slavery
on
the
other
hand
colored
people
will
always
be
sorry
and
unthankful
to
those
brute
overseers
and
raping
slave
owners
who
so
sinfully
and
beastfully
forced
upon
and
taught
numerous
and
most
harmful
immoral
vices
to
their
slaves
and
those
and
vices
are
still
clinging
to
and
leaving
their
marks
on
the
rapidly
advancing
colored
people
just
as
the
poison
ivy
clings
to
and
mars
the
health
and
beauty
of
the
young
and
tender
acorn
sprouts
as
they
struggle
upward
to
become
future
majestic
oaks
in
the
densely
foliaged
forests
however
all
of
the
white
people
in
america
at
that
time
did
not
approve
of
or
own
slaves
just
as
all
of
the
white
people
in
the
united
states
today
do
not
approve
of
nor
take
part
in
discriminating
against
respectable
colored
people
because
they
knew
it
was
not
right
they
had
the
kind
of
christianity
that
was
real
and
pure
enough
to
make
their
minds
fully
understand
and
their
hearts
to
tenderly
feel
that
slavery
in
its
kindest
manner
is
the
worse
sin
against
god
and
the
greatest
crime
against
humanity
and
it
was
this
class
of
and
white
men
and
women
who
secretly
and
in
great
danger
of
being
caught
and
punished
for
the
laws
of
the
country
forbid
the
educating
of
slaves
taught
the
otherwise
friendless
people
in
bondage
their
first
knowledge
of
god
and
jesus
christ
when
it
is
remembered
that
those
african
people
were
just
a
few
years
out
of
a
land
where
the
practices
of
their
tribes
for
centuries
had
been
to
worship
in
a
different
religion
it
is
easily
seen
that
the
slaves
were
an
unusual
reasoning
sensible
and
group
of
uncivilized
people
to
have
so
quickly
found
the
mistake
in
and
so
suddenly
thrown
aside
their
old
and
false
religion
and
so
readily
accepted
in
its
place
the
new
and
true
faith
answered
prayers
during
the
two
hundred
and
years
of
their
bitter
servitude
those
shackled
people
had
learned
to
place
so
much
faith
and
trust
in
their
newly
found
religion
that
they
felt
sure
god
in
his
own
wisdom
time
and
manner
would
hear
and
answer
their
usually
silent
and
always
prayers
for
deliverance
from
slavery
so
as
southern
heats
washed
briny
sweat
into
their
eyes
or
northern
colds
checked
frozen
blood
from
flowing
through
their
veins
the
hopeful
prayers
of
the
slaves
that
they
and
their
children
might
some
day
become
free
were
constantly
offered
up
from
the
tobacco
plantations
of
virginia
from
the
cotton
belts
of
alabama
georgia
and
mississippi
from
the
corn
fields
of

likewise
the
colored
people
of
today
as
they
patiently
and
gradually
draw
themselves
up
and
away
from
the
slum
and
slime
of
slavery
are
constantly
sending
up
to
heaven
from
the
east
the
west
the
north
and
the
south
points
of
this
country
their
hopeful
and
earnest
prayers
that
god
in
his
mysterious
way
will
convert
and
bring
back
to
christianity
those
prejudiced
heathenish
and
uncivilized
members
of
the
caucasian
race
who
persecute
and
discriminate
against
all
darker
races
just
on
account
of
their
progress
as
living
witnesses
and
proofs
that
such
prayers
are
already
being
duly
heard
and
daily
answered
by
god
the
author
will
tell
on
the
following
pages
of
this
book
mainly
for
the
inspiration
of
colored
boys
and
girls
so
that
they
will
not
lose
confidence
in
themselves
trust
in
mankind
and
faith
in
god
just
a
little
of
the
remarkable
progress
and
success
made
by
the
american
colored
people
during
their
years
of
freedom
but
the
negro
youths
who
read
these

pages
should
ever
bear
in
mind
that
the
members
of
their
race
who
have
climbed
and
mounted
these
rounds
of
success
have
only
been
able
to
do
so
through
the
guidance
and
care
of
god
through
the
unswerving
determinations
and
ceaseless
struggles
on
the
part
of
themselves
and
through
the
hearty
and
brotherhood

of
the

who
avenged
the
death
of

seven
american
martyrs
at
lexington
and

by
slaying
major
pitcairn
the
british
officer

cited
for

gallantry
at

is
understood
that
among
those
who
received
pensions
at
the
close
of
the
war
were
cato
howe
ames
and
coburn
few
know
that
it
was
a
colored
man
jordan
freeman
who
timely
and
mortally
received
on
his
ready
spear
point
the
british
officer
major
montgomery
as
he
daringly
leaped
followed
by
his
soldiers
over
the
walls
of
griswold
an
american
fort
later
on
in
that
same
battle
of
the
colonists
were
over
powered
and
compelled
to
surrender
whereupon
the
american
leader
ledyard
courteously
handed
his
sword
to
the
british
officer
in
command
that
unfair
englishman
upon
receiving
the
sword
immediately
thrust
it
up
to
the
hilt
through
the
body
of
ledyard
a
colored
soldier
lambo
latham
who
was
standing
near
and
saw
the
dastardly
act
made
one
mighty
pantherlike
leap
and
loyally
avenged
the
death
of
his
american
commander
by
plunging
his
bayonet
clear
through
the
body
of
that
ungallant
britisher
for
that
act
of
fidelity
and
patriotism
lambo
latham
received
over
thirty
bayonet
stabs
from
the
enemy
before
he
stopped
fighting
and
gave
his
last
breath
for
america
and
its
white
people
who
at
that
moment
were
denying
their
colored
slaves
the
same
sweet
freedom
for
which
they
were
fighting
to
get
from
england
not
only
did
john
bull
s
subjects
have
to
face
human
lions
in
the
forms
of
fighting
colored
men
but
they
also
had
to
feel
the
pains
and
fear
the
death
dealing
blows
of
human
tigeresses
in
the
forms
of
colored
women
fighters
and
all
americans
who
are
truely
proud
of
their
country
and
its
real
history
should
read
and
remember
about
one
molly
pitcher
who
after
her
husband
had
been
killed
in
the
battle
of
monmouth
bravely
took
his
place
at
a
cannon
and
nervely
upheld
america
s
cause
during
the
remainder
of
that
fierce
and
bloody
conflict
then
there
was
the
undaunted
and
resourceful
deborah
gannet
who
by
assuming
the
name
of
bob
shurtliff
entered
the
american
army
and
went
through
more
than
one
year
of
actual
battlefield
fighting
and
camp
life
exposure
and
during
her
entire
service
she
successfully
kept
her
moral
purity
by
cleverly
hiding
from
the
officials
and
the
soldiers
the
knowledge
of
her
sex
this
in
other
words
read
her
war
record
on
a
pension
certificate
granted
to
her
after
her
honorable
discharge
from
the
army
and
there
were
doubtless
many
other
unrecognized
but
noble
negro
women
who
entered
numerous
conflicts
and
gave
their
last
drop
of
blood
and
lives
in
order
that
the
white
colonists
might
enjoy
the
freedom
that
their
colored
brothers
and
sisters
then
saw
no
signs
of
ever
receiving
in
the
war
of
there
are
few
people
who
know
that
one
of
the
main
causes
of
the
war
of
was
on
account
of
the
british
forcibly
taking
and
compelling
three
americans
two
negroes
and
one
caucasian
to
sail
under
the
english
flag
it
was
in
that
same
war
that
a
colored
soldier
jefferys
on
seeing
a
body
of
american
troops
retreating
under
heavy
fires
from
the
enemy
dashed
to
their
front
rallied
them
together
led
their
steps
back
and
repelled
the
british
soldiers
who
were
about
to
break
through
a
very
important
but
weak
point
in
general
jackson
s
defense
at
mobile
that
general
not
only
noted
that
leadership
rally
but
gave
full
credit
and
praise
where
it
was
due
he
also
expressed
gratefulness
to
the
soldier
of
color
whose
ideas
first
suggested
the
successful
use
of
bales
of
cotton
for
breastworks
in
fortifications
in
the
battles
around
new
orleans
he
looked
with
soldierly
pride
upon
the
splendid
fighting
of
his
black
troops
when
american
school
children
learn
from
their
united
states
histories
that
and
famous
naval
battle
report
we
have
met
the
enemy
and
they
are
ours
such
histories
do
not
also
inform
their
readers
that
the
personal
pronouns
we
and
ours
so
prominent
in
commodore
perry
s
above
message
includes
the
heroic
deeds
of
colored
sailors
as
well
as
white
so
when
in
reciting
these
stirring
words
their
bloods
suddenly
gallop
through
their
veins
their
chests
expand
wide
with
national
pride
their
heads
jerk
erect
with
proud
fighting
spirits
and
their
eyes
sparkle
bright
with
slumbering
fires
such
patriotic
emotions
have
been
unknowingly
and
involuntarily
aroused
in
true
american
youths
because
of
the
loss
of
colored
blood
and
lives
as
well
as
of
white
in
those
lake
battles
and
among
those
bronze
salts
were
jack
johnson
not
our
present
heavyweight
prize
fighter
of
the
world
and
john
davis
who
were
both
especially
mentioned
for
distinguished
service
on
the
schooner
george
that
world
known
message
of
also
included
many
other
negro
sailors
who
pitted
their
bravery
and
brawn
against
the
british
tars
in
order
to
help
commodore
oliver
hazard
perry
to
break
the
backbone
of
the
war
of
by
opening
up
a
clear
passage
on
the
great
lakes
it
was
through
that
same
newly
made
water
path
that
general
william
henry
harrison
the
hero
of
tippicanoe
log
cabin
and
hard
cider
and
his
seasoned
famed
indian
fighters
were
conveyed
in
order
to
enter
canada
where
they
completely
defeated
the
artful
proctor
and
slew
the
cunning
tecumseh
in
that
savagely
fought
battle
of
the
thames
thus
colored
fighters
helped
to
end
the
foxy
and
wolfish
partnership
that
had
annoyed
and
tormented
for
so
long
the
american
settlers
on
the
northern
frontiers
in
the
mexican
war
if
it
were
possible
for
general
santa
anna
to
bodily
slip
back
to
earth
personally
mingle
amid
and
chat
with
those
of
his
soldier
friends
who
are
still
living
it
is
more
than
likely
that
among
the
many
things
talked
over
they
would
seriously
mention
the
fact
of
having
caught
many
hasty
glances
of
dark
fighting
faces
under
command
of
the
american
generals
taylor
and
scott
who
kept
the
mexicans
on
a
constant
around
vera
cruz
buena
vista
and
other
places
in
that
section
on
account
of
negroes
at
that
period
being
greatly
removed
from
the
united
states
army
and
state
militias
because
of
racial
questions
it
is
not
likely
that
many
colored
fighters
had
a
chance
to
get
busy
in
that
one
and
a
half
year
backyard
quarrel
and
fight
there
was
published
in
a
western
paper
a
few
years
ago
an
account
of
a
mexican
war
colored
veteran
known
as
captain
jackson
who
died
in
chicago
in
and
in
order
to
have
received
that
military
title
officially
or
unofficially
he
surely
must
have
used
some
brain
power
as
well
as
much
brawn
force
in
helping
to
establish
america
s
boundary
line
on
the
southern
frontier
through
the
underground
railroad
every
local
was
a

no
thundering

no

on

where
all
were
hid
throughout
the
day
engineers

and
agents
most
were
of
quaker
stock
that
godly
host
who
through
their
silent
roads
transported
blacks
from
slavery
goads
many
years
before
the
civil
war
there
was
organized
among
the
northern
white
and
christian
people
mostly
quakers
a
secret
society
to
help
runaway
slaves
to
escape
from
the
south
into
the
free
states
and
canada
this
society
on
account
of
its
hidden
winding
and
rapid
ways
of
carrying
its
fleeing
and
hunted
passengers
into
places
of
freedom
and
safety
was
known
as
the
underground
railroad
as
early
as
there
are
evidences
of
an
underground
road
a
letter
of
george
washington
written
in
that
year
speaks
of
a
slave
escaping
from
virginia
to
philadelphia
and
being
there
aided
by
a
society
of
quakers
formed
for
the
purpose
of
assisting
in
liberating
slaves
it
was
not
however
until
after
the
war
of
that
escaped
slaves
began
to
find
their
way
by
the
underground
roads
in
considerable
numbers
to
from
maine
to
kansas
all
the
northern
states
were
dotted
with
the
underground
stations
and
covered
with
a
network
of
the
underground
roads
it
is
estimated
that
between
and
over
slaves
were
aided
to
escape
by
way
of
philadelphia
during
this

period

without

among
the
greatest
workers
in

society
and
truest
white

to
the
freedom
seeking

were
calvin
fairbanks
who
was
arrested
and
kept
for
over
fifteen
years
in
southern
jails
where
he
was
daily
whipped
until
blood
flowed
from
his
back
just
because
he
helped
human

to
get
their
freedom

was

and
had
to
sell
all
his

and
real

to
pay
the

imposed
upon
him
by
the
southerners
for
doing
the

by
aiding
the

kind

serious
wit

that
smile
up
from
a
walt
mason

article
from

they

when
he
signed
his
immortal
name
that
day
it
meant
that
together
the

stay
it

the

to
their
freedom
goals
it
washed
one
sin
from
the
rebels
souls
if
colored
men
and
women
in
the
previous
wars
could
become
such
wonderful
fighters
and
loyal
americans
with
no
knowledge
and
little
hope
of
ever
receiving
freedom
from
their
unnumbered
slave
sufferings
and
sacrifices
then
how
much
braver
and
more
patriotic
would
they
be
when
fighting
with
a
new
hope
and
full
knowledge
that
their
future
freedom
depended
upon
the
success
of
the
side
on
which
they
were
fighting
it
is
needless
to
say
that
out
of
the
more
than
one
hundred
forty
thousand
colored
people
who
took
active
parts
in
the
civil
war
there
were
countless
numbers
of
gallant
and
deeds
performed
by
them
that
were
only
seen
and
noted
by
god
and
those
acts
of
valor
and
heroism
that
were
witnessed
and
recorded
here
on
earth
by
mankind
are
so
numerous
that
space
herein
will
not
allow
but
the
mention
of
a
very
few
captain
andre
cailloux
was
one
of
the
bravest
soldiers
to
fall
in
the
union
charge
on
fort
hudson
it
is
said
that
his
company
charged
that
fort
six
times
looking
into
the
and
mouths
of
the
enemy
s
cannons
with
a
heavy
loss
among
his
men
in
each
charge
feeling
sure
he
was
going
to
his
certain
death
yet
never
flynching
a
colored
soldier
anselmas
plancianocis
who
was
a
color
sergeant
uttered
the
following
words
to
his
commander
before
departing
to
his
post
of
duty
within
gun
range
and
full
view
to
the
enemy
colonel
i
will
bring
back
these
colors
in
honor
or
report
to
god
the
reason
he
never
brought
back
the
colors
at
another
time
during
the
noted
battle
at
fort
wagner
it
was
william
carney
who
upon
seeing
the
colors
about
to
trail
on
the
ground
as
they
slipped
from
the
relaxing
grasp
of
a
dying
comrade
quickly
leaped
to
his
side
grabbed
the
flag
staff
and
planted
it
on
the
breastworks
when
he
in
turn
was
severely
wounded
and
carried
to
the
rear
he
had
just
strength
and
breath
enough
to
whisper
boys
the
old
flag
never
touched
the
both
artists
and
poets
have
often
come
forth
to
paint
and
sing
of
the
fierce
fighting
and
brave
stand
made
by
that
famous
massachusetts
colored
regiment
and
its
fearless
and
beloved
white
commander
robert
gould
shaw
he
fell
in
the
thickest
of
the
battle
surrounded
by
hundreds
of
his
wounded
and
dying
colored
troops
whom
he
had
watched
over
as
a
loving
father
and
always
led
as
a
fighting
officer
although
shaw
and
his
men
were
greatly
outnumbered
by
the
enemy
who
repulsed
their
attack
at
fort
wagner
the
colored
soldiers
who
had
marched
continually
a
day
and
a
night
without
stopping
and
then
pitched
right
into
fighting
without
rest
or
food
proved
to
both
the
north
and
south
that
they
were
among
the
bravest
of
brave
soldiers
civil
war
veterans
now
living
and
when
meeting
each
other
usually
become
so
excited
when
tongue
fighting
their
battles
over
again
that
they
forget
for
the
time
being
all
about
their
rheumatics
and
throw
away
their
canes
as
they
hop
about
trying
to
imitate
their
former
military
actions
in
battles
those
who
were
there
take
delight
in
telling
how
fitzhugh
lee
and
his
prancing
old
dominion
well
trained
white
soldiers
met
their
waterloo
in
fort
powhatan
at
the
hands
of
the
belittled
and
untrained
slave
troops
it
was
at
fort
harrison
in
virginia
that
the
southerners
on
seeing
negro
troops
charging
on
the
fort
taunted
them
with
come
on
darkies
we
want
your
eye
witnesses
say
that
the
darkies
being
so
used
to
obeying
orders
really
did
take
the
guns
to
the
fort
but
several
hours
afterwards
when
the
smoke
had
cleared
away
it
was
seen
that
those
rebels
who
had
remained
to
accept
the
muskets
had
received
the
bayonet
ends
through
their
bodies
instead
of
the
trigger
ends
into
their
hands
butler
s
records
show
that
his
ten
regiments
of
soldiers
brought
victory
and
fame
all
along
their
fighting
lines
aside
from
the
chief
motive
to
help
free
themselves
without
doubt
one
of
the
main
things
that
spurred
the
negro
men
to
fight
so
valiantly
was
their
constant
memory
of
fort
pillow
at
that
fort
were
stationed
northern
white
soldiers
and
colored
troops
all
under
the
command
of
major
booth
on
the
twelfth
of
april
that
place
was
surrounded
by
a
much
larger
confederate
force
under
generals
chalmers
and
forest
and
ordered
to
surrender
upon
the
fort
refusing
to
do
so
the
rebels
closed
in
with
their
usual
battle
cry
no
quarter
and
then
as
they
broke
in
the
fort
and
overpowered
the
handful
of
union
men
there
began
a
scene
of
unmentioned
butchering
and
slaughtering
of
northern
white
soldiers
and
colored
men
women
and
children
that
far
surpassed
in
horribleness
the
massacre
of
custer
and
his
faithful
little
band
by
the
sioux
chief
sitting
bull
and
his
merciless
indian
warriors
so
after
that
whenever
colored
men
entered
battles
their
answer
to
the
rebel
s
no
quarter
was
a
challenge
remember
fort
pillow
and
times
too
numerous
to
mention
did
negro
soldiers
fully
avenge
that
awful
massacre
of
their
comrades
on
that
april
day
in
fort
pillow
by

of

supreme
brave

for

purpose
the
saving
of
the

and
the
freedom
of
themselves
in
summing
up
this
part
of
this
very
important
topic
the
writer
can
think
of
no
better
way
of
strengthening
the
truth
of
foregoing
assertions
relative
to
negro
battlefield
valour
and
loyalty
in
the
civil
war
than
by
quoting
the
following
when
the
battle
test
came
these
regiments
justified
the
hopes
entertained
by
their
sanguine
this
just
and
high
tribute
was
paid
to
colored
civil
war
fighters
by
comrade
john
mcelroy
a
white
editor
of
washington
in
the
editorial
correspondence
of
his
national
tribune
published
april
he
had
written
about
general
rufus
saxton
of
massachusetts
taking
military
command
of
helena
island
and
forming
the
thousands
of
idle
negro
men
into
regiments
during
the
early
stages
of
the
civil
war
on
the
sea
in
the
month
of
june
the
union
schooner
s
waring
was
captured
by
the
confederate
privateer
jeff
davis
all
the
crew
of
the
schooner
with
the
exception
of
a
colored
man
william
tillman
and
two
white
men
were
taken
from
the
ship
and
replaced
by
rebel
sailors
at
an
opportune
moment
tillman
killed
the
rebel
captain
and
mate
drove
all
the
other
rebels
at
the
point
of
a
gun
below
deck
and
took
full
charge
of
the
ship
after
ploughing
through
a
terrific
storm
during
which
time
the
rebel
sailors
were
brought
up
and
forced
to
help
man
the
ship
the
colored
sailor
safely
guided
the
recaptured
s
waring
into
the
harbor
of
new
york
for
that
nervy
and
patriotic
act
he
received
from
the
federal
government
prize
money
amounting
to
six
thousand
dollars
it
was
through
the
gamesness
and
shrewd
planning
of
robert
small
a
man
of
color
that
the
confederate
gunboat
the
planter
was
stolen
out
of
charleston
harbor
running
the
gauntlet
of
the
rebel
s
watchful
forts
and
barking
cannons
and
safely
delivered
into
the
hands
of
a
northern
squadron
in
payment
for
this
naval
strategy
robert
small
was
made
captain
of
the
gunboat
he
captured
and
during
his
service
continued
to
show
marked
fearlessness
as
a
fighting
sailor
and

compelling

the
colored
soldiers
and

laid
aside
their
warfare

with
proud
and
thankful
feelings
that
they
had
been
given
such
great
chances
to
help
fight
for
and
secure
their
own
freedom
on
the
plantations
from
african
jungles
to
american
shores
negroes
were
brought
to
do
all
the
chores
though
bought
and
sold
without
due
blame
they
now
forgive
this
country
s
shame
the
slaves
who
went
into
the
battles
of
the
civil
war
came
up
to
all
the
standards
of
loyalty
and
bravery
that
had
been
set
for
them
as
fighting
soldiers
but
it
was
left
to
the
millions
of
colored
men
who
staid
on
the
plantations
during
the
war
to
come
up
to
and
go
far
beyond
the
standards
of
moral
and
human
just
treatment
set
by
their
owners
the
colored
men
who
were
in
the
war
were
really
enjoying
a
temporary
freedom
while
they
were
fighting
for
a
permanent
freedom
but
it
was
quite
different
with
the
shackled
men
who
staid
on
the
plantations
during
the
war
they
were
then
slaves
not
only
one
way
but
in
three
ways
first
they
were
still
slaves
to
their
owners
as
they
were
yet
under
their
control
secondly
they
were
slaves
to
themselves
inasmuch
as
they
were
their
own
bosses
and
overseers
to
plant
cultivate
and
reap
the
crops
in
the
absence
of
the
white
men
thirdly
and
most
important
of
all
they
were
slaves
to
the
trust
and
honor
under
which
they
had
been
left
with
the
care
and
protection
of
the
white
women
and
children
on
the
plantations
and
no
records
in
history
have
been
found
to
show
where
those
thousands
of
white
wives
daughters
mothers
and
sisters
made
complaints
to
their
returned
husbands
sons
fathers
and
brothers
about
having
forced
upon
them
insulting
and
raping
attentions
from
those
millions
of
slave
men
under
whose
whole
care
those
white
women
had
been
freely
left
and
safely
kept
during
the
civil
war
if
those
colored
men
had
wanted
to
copy
the
spiteful
revengeful
and
immoral
actions
of
most
of
their
white
owners
they
could
easily
have
mistreated
or
destroyed
all
of
those
helpless
white
women
and
children
in
revenge
for
the
two
hundred
and
years
of
unspeakable
crimes
committed
against
their
colored
womanhood
by
the
southern
white
slave
owners
and
overseers
or
the
slaves
could
have
run
away
joined
the
union
army
in
a
mass
and
left
alone
those
destitute
white
women
and
children
to
starve
on
the
untilled
plantations
but
those
men
of
the
negro
race
not
then
three
hundred
years
from
the
underbrush
of
africa
had
under
their
dark
skins
too
much
inborn
manhood
and
brotherhood
qualities
to
stoop
down
to
such
beastily
acts
they
naturally
grasped
that
grand
and
big
opportunity
to
show
to
the
southern
white
people
and
the
rest
of
the
watchful
world
that
helplessly
looked
on
in
silence
but
with
pitiful
and
admiring
glances
that
they
had
in
their
characters
and
dispositions
and
knew
when
and
how
to
use
them
the
sterling
principles
of
loyal
friendliness
tender
feelings
human
considerations
moral
and
christlike
mercy
it
is
undeniably
true
that
as
early
as
there
were
in
the
united
states
over
five
hundred
thousand
mulattoes
ref
work
s
negro
year
book
page
edition
among
that
large
number
many
thousands
were
beautiful
and
innocent
girls
who
were
either
retained
as
their
white
owners
immoral
mistresses
on
southern
plantations
or
sold
hither
and
thither
from
the
potomac
river
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
to
be
forced
into
shameful
and
degraded
lives
a
more
friendless
unhappy
and
unprotected
than
longfellow
s
wandering
evangeline
as
the
civil
war
did
not
begin
until
it
is
readily
seen
that
those
one
half
million
and
more
mulattoes
were
not
the
results
of
slave
men
forcing
immoral
attentions
upon
the
white
women
and
girls
left
under
their
personal
cares
during
the
four
years
of
the
civil
war
but
those
half
white
people
were
the
undeniable
results
of
the
brutal
rapings
of
white
plantation
owners
and
overseers
upon
their
helpless
and
unprotected
black
slave
women
for
over
two
hundred
years
so
is
it
strange
that
fair
and
pure
minded
white
people
throughout
the
world
knowing
and
seeing
all
around
them
today
the
increased
results
of
those
first
beastily
actions
by
immoral
members
of
their
own
race
listen
without
interest
but
with
shame
and
impatience
whenever
through
sheer
politeness
they
are
compelled
to
remain
as
audiences
before
certain
classes
of
southern
men
who
for
centuries
including
today
have
been
talking
through
mouth
and
press
about
keeping
their
southern
white
blood
untainted
and
unstained
colored
boys
and
girls
therefore
should
not
become
and
discouraged
when
they
read
in
newspapers
or
hear
from
platforms
such
southern
white
men
writing
or
making
such
talks
because
and
white
people
in
the
south
in
the
north
and
throughout
the
world
fully
understand
the
whole
situation
and
do
not
in
the
least
take
such
southern
false
utterances
seriously
in
fact
they
usually
can
not
keep
from
laughing
at
the
funny
side
of
the
whole
thing
and
say
among
themselves
how
no
one
but
god
knows
the
number
of
deceived
southern
white
married
women
who
during
slavery
days
secretly
worried
themselves
sick
slowly
pined
away
and
silently
died
of
broken
hearts
in
their
richly
furnished
colonial
mansions
because
of
the
ever
haunting
taunting
and
stinging
knowledge
that
their
unfaithful
disloyal
and
immoral
husbands
as
well
as
being
the
fathers
of
their
white
wives
children
were
also
the
fathers
of
their
slave
mistresses
mulatto
offsprings
so
is
it
surprising
that
and
white
people
always
exchange
knowing
winks
with
their
friends
and
hurriedly
put
handkerchiefs
up
to
their
mouths
in
order
to
hide
disgusted
features
and
weary
yawns
whenever
they
find
themselves
in
places
where
they
have
to
listen
to
certain
classes
of
southern
white
men
who
for
centuries
including
today
have
been
boasting
from
platform
and
press
about
their
unsurpassed
and
unexcelled
fidelity
and
chivalry
to
their
southern
white
womanhood
instead
of
losing
their
ambitions
and
hopes
when
hearing
and
reading
such
blaspheming
words
against
their
race
and
progress
colored
boys
and
girls
should
take
on
new
hope
and
redouble
their
efforts
in
striving
to
become
even
more
devout
christians
higher
learned
students
better
skilled
industrial
workers
and
fuller
citizens
in
reference
to
the
inferiority
of
their
colors
colored
youths
should
remember
that
the
prettiest
thing
in
the
world
the
rainbow
is
colored
and
yet
no
one
is
able
to
resist
the
fascinations
of
its
archful
beauty
or
forget
the
consolations
of
its
floodless
promise
just
because
nature
with
splashing
rain
drops
and
flashing
sun
rays
oft
ribbons
the
sky
with
rainbow
hues
no
one
but
god
knows
the
number
of
black
slave
women
who
moaned
their
heart
strings
loose
and
died
of
broken
spirits
either
in
their
log
cabins
or
out
in
fields
because
of
the
ever
torturing
knowledge
that
the
virtues
and
womanhoods
of
themselves
and
the
chaste
maidenhoods
of
their
immatured
and
innocent
daughters
had
been
repeatedly
and
forcibly
taken
or
sold
by
their
white
owners
and
overseers
yet
not
one
of
those
white
rapists
was
lynched
tortured
and
burned
at
the
stake
by
negroes
not
even
at
the
close
of
the
civil
war
when
there
were
thousands
of
holders
living
in
some
southern
districts
where
the
colored
people
outnumbered
the
white
people
five
to
one
and
surely
after
gallantly
fighting
through
the
thickest
and
hottest
battles
of
the
war
it
was
not
fear
nor
cowardice
that
held
those
colored
men
from
avenging
the
unprintable
immoral
wrongs
forcibly
done
for
over
two
hundred
years
to
their
unprotected
and
helpless
colored
women
but
it
was
the
living
up
to
and
the
carrying
out
of
a
certain
high
civic
principle
of
their
african
tribal
laws
that
they
had
inherited
and
which
prevented
the
from
striking
such
a
revengeful
blow
upon
the
southern
whites
for
among
savage
tribes
in
africa
the
universal
punishment
for
raping
was
certain
death
different
tribes
having
different
methods
of
dealing
out
that
penalty
but
that
punishment
was
never
dealt
out
by
a
mob
those
tribes
so
respected
and
obeyed
the
laws
under
which
they
lived
and
were
governed
that
as
savage
as
they
appeared
to
be
they
always
had
enough
over
their
tempers
and
passions
to
leave
the
captures
trials
convictions
and
executions
of
such
offenders
to
be
carried
out
by
their
chiefs
and
their
assistants
who
had
been
put
in
their
offices
for
such
purposes
and
since
america
had
made
laws
and
appointed
officers
who
should
have
caught
tried
convicted
and
punished
those
southern
white
men
who
raped
enough
black
women
to
cause
the
birth
of
over
a
half
million
mulattoes
the
men
felt
that
even
if
those
laws
had
not
been
enforced
by
people
who
had
been
selected
to
do
so
it
was
not
their
rights
to
take
the
laws
into
their
own
hands
by
forming
themselves
into
lynching
mobs
they
felt
that
just
as
raping
of
either
black
or
white
women
is
a
most
damnable
crime
so
is
lynching
either
by
black
or
white
mobs
a
most
hellish
sin
in
making
comparisons
between
the
ancient
laws
of
nippur
and
the
modern
laws
of
the
united
states
relative
to
slaves
the
journalist
arthur
brisbane
in
the
june
issue
of
the
new
york
american
under
the
title
today
wrote
in
part
as
follows
five
thousand
years
ago
some
laws
were
better
than
those
of
our
day
for
instance
in
those
ancient
laws
if
a
slave
woman
had
a
child
the
father
being
her
owner
the
mother
and
the
child
were
set
free
in
magnificent
america
in
lincoln
s
day
thousands
of
slave
children
with
slave
owners
for
fathers
were
sold
in
the
public
now
not
for
one
moment
do
intelligent
and
colored
citizens
uphold
or
make
excuses
for
the
brutish
crimes
committed
by
the
degenerate
members
and
there
are
many
of
their
own
race
for
they
fully
realize
that
it
means
a
faster
and
higher
progress
of
all
their
people
to
have
colored
criminals
punished
to
the
fullest
extent
of
the
law
after
they
have
been
given
the
same
fair
trials
convictions
and
sentences
that
are
handed
out
to
the
thousands
of
white
criminals
who
commit
the
same
kind
of
crimes
and
just
as
colored
degenerates
are
disgusting
and
shameful
to
living
white
people
so
are
white
degenerates
disgusting
and
shameful
to
living
colored
people
thus
the
and
colored
and
white
citizens
now
mutually
know
that
it
is
for
the
greater
advancement
of
both
races
and
a
closer
brotherhood
combining
of
all
americans
for
them
to
see
to
it
as
far
as
possible
that
all
criminals
be
rightly
protected
when
arrested
given
fair
trials
safely
guarded
after
sentenced
and
fully
punished
in
a
confinement
where
they
can
not
further
morally
lower
themselves
nor
longer
dilute
the
purity
of
human
society
and
in
thus
far
carrying
out
their
christian
duties
for
the
elevation
of
humanity
good
colored
and
white
people
are
contented
in
knowing
that
for
those
criminals
of
both
races
who
are
shrewd
enough
to
escape
the
detection
and
punishment
of
earthly
laws
there
is
a
heavenly
law
that
never
fails
to
punish
them
at
the
proper
time
and
even
while
on
their
death
beds
those
evil
doers
are
twisting
and
turning
in
mental
and
bodily
sufferings
they
will
not
on
account
of
their
torturing
pains
be
able
to
truthfully
and
peacefully
chant
such
consoling
lines
that
are
found
in

a

by

author
of
a
man
without

in
relation
to
the
rightful
recognition
and

of
the
american
negro
melodies
sung
on
the
southern
plantations
during
slavery
since
then
and
music
loving
people
of
both
races
have
come
to
fully
recognize
acknowledge
and
appreciate
the
truthfulness
of
the
above
compliment
for
many
years
after
their
freedom
great
number
of
harbored
bitter
dislikes
toward
these
songs
because
they
so
clearly
and
painfully
reminded
them
of
their
past
and
sufferings
during
slave
days
most
of
their
children
caught
this
feeling
direct
from
their
parents
or
indirectly
through
their
own
vivid
imaginations
formed
from
what
they
had
heard
about
slavery
but
quick
and
deep
understanding
people
of
both
races
soon
found
in
these
crude
tuneful
words
something
far
more
interesting
and
touching
than
mere
memories
of
slavery
sins
and
sufferings
they
saw
and
felt
in
such
weird
and
original

the
most
beautiful

it
is
possible
for

to
paint

colorful
and

transposers

are
today
taking
these
rough

and
without

lifting
them
from

under
only
a
liberty
that
had
been
won
from
the
english
for
the
white
americans
by
the
illustrious
george
washington
but
it
was
left
for
abraham
lincoln
to
win
for
the
united
states
a
liberty
by
cutting
the
chains
of
slavery
from
the
wrists
and
ankles
of
the
black
americans
and
also
refreeing
the
white
americans
by
unchaining
from
their
souls
the
temptations
they
had
become
too
to
resist
and
too
selfish
to
give
up
of
their
own
accord
as
soon
as
the
colored
people
had
passed
out
from
the
sufferings
of
slavery
they
were
at
once
compelled
as
free
but
ignorant
homeless
and
penniless
people
to
begin
their
upward
struggles
and
progress
through
a
reign
of
terror
this
reign
of
terror
was
caused
by
the
brutal
treatment
and
murdering
of
thousands
of
innocent
colored
people
and
the
destruction
of
their
properties
by
an
uneducated
uncivilized
and
unchristianized
element
of
southern
white
people
who
were
known
as
night
riders
ku
klux
klan
of
whom
the
best
minded
white
people
even
in
the
south
were
ashamed
but
the
sturdy
and
hopeful
colored
people
came
through
that
awful
ordeal
as
they
had
come
through
slavery
with
increasing
determination
and
greater
efforts
to
push
forward
and
upward
to
the
best
and
highest
things
in
life
however
it
was
only
their
unfaltering
trust
in
god
that
gave
them
enough
hopeful
vision
in
the
future
it
was
only
their
gratitude
to
and
appreciation
of
their
northern
and
southern
white
aiding
friends
that
retained
them
enough
patience
and
faith
in
mankind
it
was
only
their
keenness
to
see
the
funny
side
of
life
s
happenings
that
enabled
them
to
laugh
and
keep
cheerful
it
was
only
their
ability
and
willingness
to
do
any
and
all
kinds
of
hard
work
that
enabled
them
to
sleep
through
the
whole
nights
with
peaceful
minds
and
it
was
only
their
great
big
healthy
appetites
that
gave
them
enough
vitality
stamina
physical
strength
and
to
pass
through
those
years
of
body
sufferings
and
spirit
crushings
and
safely
reach
their
present
stages
of
upward
progress
and
onward
success
thus
the
negro
race
has
proven
that
just
as
a
and
resourceful
individual
can
not
rest
with
a
peaceful
and
happy
mind
as
long
as
staying
in
the
easygoing
and
narrow
rut
of
a
position
but
fearlessly
steps
out
with
a
determined
mind
hopeful
heart
and
unbounded
enthusiasm
to
face
and
overcome
the
of
this
world
that
finally
yields
up
to
that
individual
his
or
her
and
genuine
success
so
will
a
race
of
people
of
similar
qualities
and
aspirations
be
restless
until
it
wades
and
crawls
out
of
a
miry
and
stagnant
pool
of
ignorance
and
poverty
and
enters
a
channel
of
freshly
flowing
active
thoughts
where
it
can
freely
swim
abreast
in
fair
competition
with
other
races
in
order
to
reach
those
distant
ports
of
christian
service
citizenship
usefulness
financial
independence
self
culture
and
human
helpfulness
while
the
negro
race
in
the
united
states
succeeded
in
swimming
into
that
channel
in
it
has
never
been
allowed
like
other
races
therein
to
use
either
a
and
noisy
stroke
or
a
and
noiseless
but
has
been
compelled
to
paddle
along
using
a
stroke
having
one
leg
and
arm
tied
together
with
strings
of
race
discriminations
the
entire
racing
course
clogged
with
floating
debris
of
public
decayed
sentiments
and
a
plaited
cord
of
race
tied
to
the
big
toe
of
the
free
leg
that
has
been
roughly
and
constantly
yanked
back
throughout
the
swim
with
all
that
prejudiced
and
unsportsmanlike
handicap
the
american
colored
people
have
increased
their
ownership
of
homes
from
twelve
thousand
in
to
six
hundred
thousand
in
they
owned
in
over
two
hundred
thousand
farms
that
with
other
real
estate
holdings
comprised
million
acres
of
land
in
they
ran
a
little
over
two
thousand
business
enterprises
and
in
they
had
increased
that
number
to
fifty
thousand
business
concerns
doing
a
volume
of
business
amounting
to
about

were

they
continued
to

that
the

within

this
is
not
a
bad
record
for
such
a
handicapped
life
swimmer
as
the
negro
race
is
compelled
to
be
in
the
united
states
and
certainly
proves
that
when
it
comes
to
keeping
a
body
above
the
water
surface
and
at
the
same
time
make
progress
up
a
rough
stream
against
a
strong
prejudiced
current
the
negro
if
he
really
is
a
fifth
cousin
to
the
foolish
noisy
frolicsome
and
call
of
the
wild
goose
family
he
is
also
a
first
cousin
to
the
sensible
industrious
frugal
quiet
dignified
and
swan
family
in
congress
it
is
a
most
remarkable
fact
that
only
seven
years
after
the
emancipation
of
his
race
hiram
revels
a
colored
man
entered
the
united
states
congress
as
a
senator
from
mississippi
but
it
becomes
a
remarkable
and
interesting
fact
when
one
learns
that
the
congressional
seat
taken
by
revels
was
the
chair
made
vacant
by
jefferson
davis
who
left
congress
and
the
union
side
to
join
the
confederacy
where
he
later
became
its
president
and
leader
to
keep
negroes
in
slavery
that
explains
the
question
so
many
people
have
asked
why
revels
only
served
one
year
in
the
senate
he
was
elected
to
serve
the
last
year
that
jeff
davis
had
left
unfinished
in
his
term
when
he
went
over
to
the
rebel
forces
bruce
also
from
mississippi
served
a
full
term
of
six
years
in
the
senate
so
far
those
two
have
been
the
only
colored
men
to
be
seated
and
serve
in
the
senate
in
pinchback
a
colored
man
was
elected
to
the
senate
but
the
right
of
the
legislature
to
legally
elect
a
senator
was
challenged
the
contention
was
urged
that
the
legislature
itself
was
not
legally
elected
the
contest
lasted
four
years
and
ended
with
seven
republican
senators
voting
with
the
democrats
to
deny
him
the
seat
he
was
later
given
four
years
salary
as
a
senator
during
the
period
of
reconstruction
right
after
the
civil
war
this
same
colored
man
was
elected
and
served
as
of
louisiana

bravely
facing

pouring
down
from

hill
tops
of
el
caney
and
san
juan
and
ever
will
it
go
down
in
history
that
they
were
members
of
the
celebrated
colored
cavalry
who
while
fighting
on
san
juan
hill
sprang
to
the
timely
rescue
of
the
late
colonel
theodore
roosevelt
and
his
famous
rough
riders
and
saved
them
from
certain
and
horrible
deaths
at
the
hands
of
the
merciless
spaniards
but
why
here
go
further
into
details
regarding
the
conduct
of
colored
men
in
that
war
when
the
official
reports
of
such
capable
warriors
and
experienced
military
judges
as
shafter
kent
lawton
joseph
wheeler
colonel
now
general
leonard
wood
and
other
high
commanding
officers
give
rightful
credit
and
praise
to
the
colored
soldiers
who
displayed
such
remarkable
patriotism
and
heroism
in
that
short
and
fierce
there
ll
be
a
hot
time
in
the
old
town
war
this
quotation
is
the
title
of
a
very
popular
tune
sung
during
this
war
by
the
american
soldiers
and
civilians
when
hobson
made
his
and
sea
trip
through
a
gauntlet
of
spanish
frowning
guns
there
were
more
than
colored
sailors
with
him
who
then
shared
all
of
his
dangers
and
later
a
little
of
his
fame
another
most
important
naval
action
centered
around
a
colored
sailor
john
jordan
chief
gunner
s
mate
who
on
may
during
the
battle
of
manilla
fired
the
first
shot
from
the
crusier
olympia
flag
ship
of
the
late
admiral
dewey
that
was
the
shot
that
opened
the
first
decisive
battle
of
the
war
as
well
as
starting
the
destruction
of
the
modern
spanish
armada
it
is
surely
in
place
to
mention
here
that
jordan
entered
the
navy
as
a
apprentice
and
was
honorably
retired
as
a
chief
petty
officer
after
spending

drew
closer

many
of
the
mexicans
slyly
slowly
and
seemingly
unconcerned
quietly
fell
back
spread
out
and
in

style
rapidly
formed
a
circle
around
the
little
band
of

they

really
noticed

regardless

loyalty
and
patriotism
in
america
colored
people
at
the
time
the
united
states
was
about
to
enter
the
world
war
were
made
to
feel
that
they
were
not
needed
nor
wanted
in
the
conflict
and
on
many
occasions
they
were
even
told
that
the
world
war
was
not
their
affair
but
was
a
white
man
s
here
is
again
shown
where
an
inherited
african
instinct
that
of
usually
being
able
to
sense
some
big
future
happening
enabled
the
american
colored
people
to
see
far
enough
into
the
distance
to
fully
realize
that
white
people
who
made
such
remarks
were
sadly
mistaken
colored
people
then
knew
as
all
other
people
later
found
out
that
they
were
as
much
concerned
and
needed
in
that
world
conflict
as
any
and
all
other
races
of
people
who
took
part
in
it
but
not
until
america
was
fearfully
startled
and
sensibly
awakened
by
the
rapid
and
persistent
progress
of
the
germans
into
france
did
this
country
reluctantly
consent
to
give
the
colored
soldiers
a
chance
and
part
in
the
war
and
even
then
their
acceptances
had
more
the
resemblances
of
the
probationary
trials
of
total
strangers
rather
than
the
glad
welcomings
of
and
friends
in
other
words
figuratively
speaking
it
was
in
the
highly
tempered
crucibles
of
the
world
war
s
whitehot
furnaces
of
universal
conflict
that
negro
americanism
was
put
through
a
retesting
process
in
order
to
determine
the
actual
purity
of
its
material
and
abstract
composition
as
to
the
outcome
of
that
unnecessary
and
unjust
retesting
process
let
the
reader
like
a
minutely
trained
chemist
sum
up
in
accurate
notations
the
final
results
but
only
after
carefully
weighing
and
reweighing
the
following
analysis
in
the
scales
of
impartiality
henry
johnson
albany
and
needham
roberts
of
trenton
were
the
first
two
americans
soldiers
colored
or
white
who
were
honored
by
the
french
government
with
the
much
coveted
croix
de
guerre
these
men
were
privates
in
the
infantry
formerly
the
distinguished
fifteenth
new
york
national
guard
regiment
that
had
been
brigaded
with
french
troops
it
was
during
the
loneliest
and
latest
hours
of
a
night
in
may
while
johnson
and
roberts
were
on
guard
duty
at
an
outpost
on
the
front
near
the
german
lines
that
they
were
suddenly
surrounded
and
attacked
by
a
raiding
party
of
a
score
of
german
soldiers
although
the
two
colored
boys
used
their
firearms
with
quickness
and
deadly
aim
to
keep
the
enemy
off
the
superior
number
of
germans
wounding
johnson
three
times
and
roberts
twice
closed
in
on
them
in
a
death
struggle
they
soon
had
roberts
on
the
ground
helpless
one
german
at
his
head
and
another
at
his
feet
johnson
noticing
the
sad
plight
of
his
loyal
friend
leaped
forward
like
a
wild
cat
at
bay
and
with
one
mighty
downward
blow
of
his
bolo
knife
split
wide
open
the
head
of
the
enemy
who
was
strangling
roberts
then
with
a
crouching
pantherlike
spring
johnson
made
a
terrific
sweep
with
his
trusty
knife
that
completely
opened
the
stomach
of
the
german
at
roberts
feet
although
on
the
ground
covered
with
blood
and
gore
roberts
upon
thus
being
released
immediately
began
to
hurl
hand
grenades
among
the
enemy
with
telling
effect
as
the
foe
with
whose
stomach
johnson
s
bolo
knife
had
made
such
a
deep
and
lasting
acquaintance
was
the
leader
of
the
raiding
party
the
then
thoroughly
frightened
germans
suddenly
lost
their
nerve
dropped
their
weapons
picked
up
their
helpless
ones
and
made
a
hasty
retreat
some
of
the
germans
had
been
killed
and
many
of
the
party
received
such
wounds
and
indelible
marks
that
throughout
their
future
lives
they
will
always
be
reminded
that
american
colored
is
a
guaranteed
fast
dye
slow
die
that
does
not
run
among
the
three
hundred
thousand
and
more
colored
soldiers
who
served
in
the
united
states
army
during
the
world
war
twenty
thousand
were
already
prepared
and
in
fighting
trim
when
america
declared
war
against
germany
those
twenty
thousand
men
were
divided
into
the
first
separate
battalion
of
the
district
of
columbia
company
g
tennessee
national
guards
first
separate
companies
of
maryland
and
connecticut

of
massachusetts
ninth

national
guard
eighth
illinois
regiment
and
cavalries
and
infantries
after
spending
the
necessary
time
in
undergoing
the
proper
government
training
colored
men
took
and
satisfactorily
passed
the
required
military
examination
and
on
october
were
commissioned
at
fort
dodge
as
officers
in
the
united
states
army
they
were
divided
into
captains
first
lieutenants
and
second
lieutenants
during
and
at
the
close
of
the
great
war
leading
white
newspapers
vied
with
each
other
in
filling
their
columns
about
the
unsurpassed
bravery
and
patriotism
of
colonel
bill
hayward
the
and
nervy
white
commander
and
his
seasoned
colored
regiment
of
new
york
it
was
the
first
colored
combat
regiment
to
go
overseas
and
was
brigaded
with
the
french
fighting
forces
as
the
regiment
to
his
admiring
colored
soldiers
fighting
bill
hayward
was
known
as
the
hell
man
and
to
the
surprised
germans
the
colored
fighters
of
the
old
regiment
were
frightfully
known
as
the
bloodthirsty
black
a
few
years
before
that
time
william
hayward
had
been
elected
the
youngest
judge
in
nebraska
and
was
known
in
that
state
as
her
handsomest
man
but
with
all
of
that
previous
civic
and
social
honor
and
fame
fighting
bill
never
forgot
to
be
a
real
white
man
and
gentleman
as
well
as
a
strict
and
just
commander
at
all
times
to
his
colored
troops
when
resting
in
camp
he
regarded
and
treated
them
as
human
beings
and
full
american
citizens
and
when
in
the
thickest
of
battles
he
did
not
ask
them
to
go
where
he
dared
not
to
venture
if
there
ever
was
such
a
place
in
battlefield
action
he
always
led
his
men
he
never
followed
them
this
explains
why
he
and
his
black
tigers
won
undying
fame
and
glory
by
holding
a
certain
sector
of
trenches
at
bois
d
hause
champagne
for
days
and
then
charging
in
great
victory
over
the
top
of
belleau
woods
and
the
bodies
of
falling
germans
it
was
during
a
very
dangerous
charge
that
a
french
commander
seeing
hayward
and
his
colored
men
about
to
plunge
into
what
seemed
to
be
a
sure
death
trap
ordered
the
american
fighters
back
big
bill
hayward
was
already
in
motion
and
shouted
over
his
shoulder
my
men
don
t
come
back
they
will
go
through
hell
but
they
won
t
come
and
with
that
parting
farewell
the
hell
man
and
his
impatiently
waiting
black
tigers
plunged
forward
and
were
soon
busy
serving
to
the
enemy
such
a
smoking
hot
dish
of
scrambled
shots
shells
and
bayonets
that
in
swallowing
them
down
those
germans
at
once
and
for
all
times
became
completely
filled
and
lost
their
appetites
for
everything
on
their
return
after
so
quickly
and
efficiently
serving
such
a
well
prepared
menu
hayward
and
his
fighters
were
decorated
with
the
croix
de
guerre
at
metz
argonne
forest
and
dis
in
the
sectors
of
marbacne
meuse
and
vosges
the
newly
trained
colored
division
mostly
manned
by
colored
officers
went
into
the
thickest
of
the
battles
with
such
telling
effects
that
fourteen
officers
and
were
awarded
the
distinguished
service
cross
when
those
battles
were
over
and
the
survivors
learned
that
they
had
lost
from
among
their
chums
killed
in
action
dead
from
wounds
slightly
or
severely
wounded
overcome
by
the
german
s
scientific
gases
and
unaccounted
for
the
division
became
even
more
convinced
that
it
had
well
earned
the
many
honors
and
distinctions
accorded
to
it
those
regiments
that
were
brigaded
with
the
french
army
were
the
and
infantries
in
the
engagements
of
minancourt
and
bois
d
hause
champagne
the
infantry
y
took
an
active
part
and
it
was
at
that
the
whole
regiment
was
cited
for
deeds
of
valor
and
awarded
the
croix
de
guerre
it
was
at
soissons
front
that
the
most
formidable
oppositions
were
successfully
faced
by
the

was
commanded
by
negro
officers
from
lieut
o
duncan
down
the
final
capture
of
hill
after
a
severe
encounter
by
that
regiment
proved
to
the
germans
that
those
colored
lads
had
not
paddled
across
the
big
pond
to
learn
the
goose
the
loss
of
out
of

signifies
the
serious
activities
of
the

in
the
champagne
sector
between
september
and
october
besides
the
entire
regiment
receiving
citation
for
extreme
bravery
its
regimental
colors
were
decorated
it
was
this
regiment
that
broke
a
standing
record
at
that
time
by
shooting
down
three
german
airplanes
on
the
wing
the
infantry
took
part
in
the
fighting
around
vacquois
sector
and
argonne
west
places
not
very
far
from
the
celebrated
verdun
for
distinguished
service
all
along
the
fighting
lines
the
whole
regiment
was
decorated
with
the
croix
de
guerre
while
the
new

enjoyed
the
distinctions
of
being
the
first
colored
fighting
organization
to
go
overseas
into
action
and
the
first
allied
division
colored
or
white
to
reach
the
banks
of
the
rhine
it
was
the
illinois
infantry
that
won
the
glory
of
probably
fighting
the
last
engagement
of
the
world
war
it
appears
that
on
the
morning
of
november
the
french
commander
sent
word
to
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
regiment
to
cease
firing
at
as
the
armistice
would
be
signed
at
that
hour
but
the
colored
troops
were
pressing
forward
so
rapidly
after
the
enemy
that
it
was
long
past
before
the
messenger
could
overtake
them
when
he
did
finally
ride
up
to
the
regiment
it
was
just
putting
on
the
finishing
frills
and
frazzles
in
capturing

of
fifty

it
was
just
at
that
most
critical
time
during
the
first
months
of
this
same
year
before
the
united
states
declared
war
against
germany
and
when
no
white
man
in
america
positively
knew
nor
absolutely
trusted
any
other
white
man
as
to
his
real
one
hundred
percent
americanism
that
the
administration
called
out
the
first
separate
colored
battalion
of
the
district
of
columbia
this
group
of
well
trained
and
true
loyal
american
soldiers
was
made
a
special
national
guard
to
defend
from
the
enemies
of

the
capitol
white
house
and
other
important
federal
buildings
located
in
washington
the
capital
of
the

of

the
mere
fact
that
the
administration
did
not
select
a
white
group
of
soldiers
for
such
a
purpose
at
such
a
critical
time
when
spies
of
the
enemy
were
everywhere
in
every
form
proves
without
a
doubt
that
the
american
white
people
not
only
had
to
admit
among
themselves
but
were
forced
to
acknowledge
to
the
whole
world
that
this
was
one
time
in
the
history
of
the
country
when
they
had
not
confidence
enough
in
members
of
their
own
race
to
intrust
to
them
the
nation
s
most
valuable
and
delicate
assets
and
responsibilities
namely
its
official
records
its
treasuries
of
monies
its
cherished
honors
and
its
government
and
the
necessary
intrusting
of
such
national
assets
and
responsibilities
to
the
care
of
colored
soldiers
reminded
the
outside
world
what
american
white
people
should
never
forget
that
the
colored
people
in
the
united
states
form
the
backbone
of
the
american
nation
especially
when
the
nation
is
required
to
use
that
backbone
in
overthrowing
such
white
traitors
of
this
country
as
the
despised
benedict
arnold
and
such
white
murderers
of
presidents
as
the
scorned
booth
that
special
colored
guard
of
honor
was
under
a
colored
commander
major
james
walker
who
at
all
times
intelligently
and
fearlessly
directed
and
guided
his
men
in
so
successfully
carrying
out
that
responsible
and
trustworthy
task
and
it
was
on
account
of
his
constant
exposure
to
all
kinds
of
early
spring
weather
they
started

march
while
daily
and
nightly
directing
and
watching
the
movements
of
his

that
major
walker
contracted
the
incurable
cold
which
resulted
in
his
fatal
illness
and
untimely
death
just
in
the
flower
of
his
youth
and
in
the
performance
of
one
of
the
most
confidential
and
duties
the

impose
upon

more

and
some
are
worthy
of
better
fates
than
be
only

and

mates
miss
should
never

foreign
nations
are
looking
in
shocking
regret
at
her
vamping
white
boys
for
caresses
to
get
in
this
school
where
one
colored
has
studied
but
yet
in
regard
to
the
colored
men
who
took
part
in
naval
strifes
on
the
high
seas
it
has
been
estimated
that
at
least
ten
thousand
of
them
served
in
the
navy
during
the
world
war
while
they
were
not
allowed
to
advance
in
the
navy
in
proportion
to
their
advancement
in
the
army
nevertheless
colored
college
graduates
and
students
fully
knowing
such
facts
put
aside
for
the
time
being
their
educational
ambitions
and
careers
entered
the
navy
and
patriotically
as
well
as
unselfishly
served
in
the
menial
positions
of
stewards
cooks
and
mess
boys
and
judging
from
the
sleek
full
cheeks
and
plump
round
bodies
of
the
officers
and
sailors
aboard
the
vessels
those
colored
boys
who
were
and
enough
to
put
down
college
pride
and
take
up
in
its
place
national
patriotism
went
into
galley
and
mess
rooms
and
used
the
same
kind
of
brain
power
in
wrestling
with
pots
and
pans
foods
and
dishes
as
they
had
so
brilliantly
used
in
tussling
with
slippery
mathematical
historical
and
linguistic
problems
when
in
their
college
and
who
but
god
has
an
accurate
record
of
the
noble
deeds
humbly
performed
by
many
of
those
entrapped
and
unrescued
colored
firemen
and
stokers
who
to
the
very
last
possible
moment
kept
up
the
motor
powers
of
their
vessels
in
trying
to
outspeed
and
outdodge
the
death
dealing
submarine
torpedoes
those
swift
snakelike
missives
were
always
aimed
and
usually
struck
at
either
the
lungs
fire
rooms
or
the
pulsating
hearts
engine
rooms
of
their
objects
and
it
was
in
those
vital
organs
of
several
great
vessels
where
many
feverishly
working
loyally
dying
and
unsung
colored
heroes
went
down
to
forever
sleep
in
the
dark
deep
chambers
of
father
the
stevedores
while
their
duties
not
being
on
the
battle
fields
nor
firing
lines
called
forth
no
spectacular
incidents
citations
for
bravery
or
award
of
medals
nevertheless
the
work
of
the
stevedores
was
as
important
and
valuable
as
the
efforts
of
any
other
division
in
the
world
war
and
their
giant
strengths
and
swiftness
of
movements
in
loading
and
unloading
supply
transports
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
ocean
played
a
very
very
clever
part
in
helping
the
world
to
finally
get
a

a

several
books
could
be
written
but
limited
space
herein
will
not
permit
but
a
few
paragraphs
covering
their
many
activities
after
the
white
american
men
had
enlisted
or
were
drafted
into
the
army
and
navy
there
were
left
vacant
thousands
and
thousands
of
responsible
positions
the
european
foreigners
who
had
previously
immigrated
here
and
were
immediately
given
even
before
they
could
understand
the
laws
of
the
land
or
speak
its
language
full
american
opportunities
and
privileges
except
the
ballot
were
now
found
unreliable
great
hordes
of
them
showed
their
gratefulness
to
america
for
earlier
throwing
wide
open
her
doors
to
them
by
refusing
to
come
up
to
her
test
of
one
hundred
percent
americanism
even
after
all
of
the
available
mothers
wives
daughters
and
sisters
of
the
departed
white
american
soldiers
were
used
in
such
places
there
still
remained
many
thousands
of
positions
unfilled
all
that
time
millions
of
colored
men
and
women
who
were
loyally
and
willingly
asking
and
waiting
to
fill
such
places
were
at
first
purposely
ignored
because
of
the
lack
of
sufficient
man
power
the
of
industry
all
over
the
country
began
to
stop
it
seemed
as
though
the
american
white
sentiment
of
prejudiced
feeling
against
the
colored
people
had
become
so
bitter
that
the
country
was
willing
to
commit
industrial
suicide
while
stopping
to
wallow
in
its
mires
of
racial
hatred
but
a
certain
good
white
sentiment
that
usually
turns
up
sooner
or
later
and
in
some
cases
more
later
than
sooner
after
great
sufferings
have
been
caused
gently
but
firmly
reminded
america
that
there
were
millions
of
colored
people
who
were
able
and
willing
to
fill
those
places
they
were
the
people
who
had
made
and
spent
their
money
here
to
enrich
and
build
up
america
as
well
as
at
all
times
and
under
all
conditions
had
proved
themselves
most
loyal
and
trustworthy
citizens
that
reminder
although
known
to
be
wholly
true
was
still
laughed
and
sneered
at
by
many
until
they
were
suddenly
and
painfully
brought
to
realize
that
they
must
either
employ
colored
people
in
those
positions
or
let
the
country
go
in
starvation
and
ruin
for
want
of
sufficient
and
proper
productions
colored
men
and
women
were
then
at
first
reluctantly
given
employment
in
all
parts
of
the
country
in
almost
all
kinds
of
work
thus
for
the
first
time
since
their
forefathers
and
mothers
had
arrived
in
america
nearly
three
hundred
years
before
colored
people
were
nationally
allowed
to
use
and
enjoy
many
of
the
opportunities
and
privileges
that
had
been
stingingly
withheld
from
them
merely
because
they
were
negroes
and
freely
given
to
many
times
forced
upon
alien
enemies
just
because
they
were
caucasians
leaving
home
in
the
morning
long
before
dawn
and
returning
late
after
twilight
colored
men
faithfully
dug
coal
in
the
mines
of
alabama
iowa
west
virginia
and
elsewhere
in
order
that
various
kinds
of
industrial
plants
might
continue
to
run
in
full
blast
and
that
transportation
carriers
might
quicken
their
speeds
to

to

broken

half
of

was
based
on
the
amount
of

along
both
the

pacific
coasts
where
the
long

grey

that
the

of

from

train
tendered
his

fifteen

of

it
is
proved
by
facts

that
about
of
the
colored

in

are
members
in
churches
and
that
they
have
put
over
million
dollars
of
their
hard
earned

into

properties

is
plainly
seen
that
people
of
the

still

perfect

trust

are
continuing

colored
ministers
of
today
on
account
of
their
advancements
have
been
able
to
bring
about
a
better
understanding
and
knowledge
of
the
true
teachings
of
the
bible
for
instance
they
are
teaching
their
congregations
that
the
timely
proper
and
equal
uses
of
emotional
and
practical
religion
are
necessary
thus
the
masses
of
people
attending
colored
churches
are
fast
learning
from
their
pulpits
that
there
is
just
as
much
needs
for
christianity
in
practical
business
and
social

each

emotional

themselves

on

also
ministers
of
today
have
long
since
come
to
differ
from
most
of
those
old
school
ministers
god
blessed
them
for
doing
the
best
they
knew
how
who
taught
their
people
to
live
think
and
say
to
other
races
give
us
jesus
and
you
can
take
the
so
the
new
school
and
more
businesslike
ministers
of
these
times
are
patiently
teaching
fast
convincing
and
gradually
converting
their
congregations
in
the
belief
and
truth
that
it
is
just
as
much
christianity
in
the
honest
earning
the
frugal
saving
the
fair
investment
the
wise
spending
and
the
merciful
sharing
of
a
dollar
with
the
poor
and
needy
as
there
is
need
for
christianity
in
the
saving
of
their
souls
and
the
spreading
of
the
gospel
along
other
practical
lines
these
gospel
leaders
are
having
remarkable
success
especially
in
large
cities
where
many
colored
people
live
it
is
wonderful
to
see
how
these
practical
ministers
have
taught
their
congregations
that
they
are
showing
as
much
reverence
to
god
when
they
pass
out
of
their
churches
after
services
and
go
quietly
and
orderly
to
their
homes
instead
of
great
numbers
of
them
stopping
right
in
front
of
their
church
doors
with
loud
talk
and
laughter
and
blocking
the
whole
pavement
against
people
who
wish
to
go
by
for
fifteen
and
twenty
minutes
as
they
do
when
sitting
quietly
and
dignified
in
their
church
pews
listening
to
the
sermons
such
gospel
leaders
in
every
instance
finally
win
their
members
over
to
their
sides
in
such
matters
by
pleasantly
and
plainly
pointing
out
that
people
of
other
races
seldom
attend
colored
churches
of
today
and
see
the
polished
and
refined
ways
people
of
the
race
deport
themselves
but
if
just
two
or
three
dozen
members
of
a
church
come
out
after
services
and
thoughtlessly
block
the
side
walks
go
along
the
streets
or
ride
in
the
trolley
cars
roughly
laughing
and
loudly
talking
their
church
and
private
affairs
to
each
other
from
one
end
of
the
car
to
the
other
they
are
seen
and
heard
by
other
races
who
class
not
only
the
church
but
the
whole
negro
race
with
those
few
and
sometimes
vain
colored
people
who
often
use
such
shameful
public
manners
to
attract
attention
to
themselves
and
their
clothes
just
like
the
same
class
of
uncouth
white
people
do
of
course
when
white
men
and
women
appear
in
public
places
acting
and
talking
in
noisy
unrefined
and
vulgar
ways
the
colored
man
or
woman
no
matter
how
little
learning
he
or
she
may
have
who
sees
and
hears
such
actions
never
judges
and
stamps
the
intelligent
refined
and
portion
of
the
caucasian
race
as
a
whole
group
of
people
also
to
be
ignored
and
discriminated
against
but
when
a
person
of
color
sees
and
hears
such
vulgar
actions
on
the
part
of
a
white
person
that
colored
person
merely
comments
to
himself
there
is
a
human
being
who
is
a
sample
of
the
worse
element
among
the
white
people
and
is
far
from
being
a
fair
and
pure
sample
of
the
best
people
in
the
white
then
that
colored
person
will
at
once
throw
the
incident
off
his
mind
he
will
then
turn
his
back
on
the
uncouth
white
person
with
disgust
and
in
facing
about
will
the
very
next
moment
give
the
fullest
consideration
the
most
humane
treatment
the
most
polite
manners
and
the
deepest
respect
to
the
white
lady
or
gentleman
whose
christian
speech
and
civilized
actions
warrant
and
deserve
such
courtesies
and
this
is
only
one
of
the
countless
big
little
instances
in
which
the
american
colored
people
are
daily
showing
their
practical
use
of
the
golden
rule
cornerstone
in
the
foundation
and
keystone
in
the
archway
of
the
white
man
s
christianity
thus
the
brotherhood
actions
and
manners
of
the
masses
of
negroes
from
the
to
the
president
of
a
university
and
from
the
scrub
woman
to
the
president
of
a
national
organization
in
being
and
enough
to
apply
the
golden
rule
to
the
caucasian
race
so
as
to
mentally
separate
and
treat
accordingly
the
good
white
people
from
the
bad
are
certainly
proving
that
the
colored
people
as
a
whole
are
daily
putting
into
practical
usages
the
lord
s
golden
rule
in
much
more
christlike
ways
than
the
white
race
is
itself
of
course
there
are
exceptions
in
both
races
but
considering
both
from
the
standpoint
of
masses
the
above
assertion
can
not
be
truthfully
denied
a
present
day
exception
on
the
white
side
may
be
cited
as
follows
during
the
summer
of
when
southern
white
savages
turned
paris
texas
into
a
human
slaughter
house
by
lynching
torturing
and
burning
alive
of
human
beings
rev
shuler
white
a
prominent
methodist
minister
living
in
that
community
fearlessly
denounced
the
mob
at
the
time
of
its
heathenish
actions
and
at
the
risk
of
his
own
life
later
when
speaking
of
a
former
statement
he
had
made
regarding
the
lynching
according
to
an
article
in
the
july
issue
of
the
chicago
defender
he
said
the
above
statement
i
make
in
the
face
of
the
advice
that
has
come
to
me
from
many
friends
that
such
a
policy
is
and
will
be
at
present
unsafe
for
me
i
am
informed
that
my
life
has
been
numerously
threatened
if
i
make
such
a
statement
i
am
told
that
the
mob
used
my
name
repeatedly
in
such
a
manner
as
to
very
much
concern
my
friends
i
can
truthfully
say
that
the
attitude
of
this
mob
toward
me
does
not
in
the
least
concern
me
better
men
than
myself
have
died
when
far
less
was
at
stake
i
am
only
concerned
in
doing
my
duty
in
this
situation
therefore
without
apology
or
plea
for
quarter
i
unhesitatingly
condemn
the
burning
of
these
men
in
our
city
as
an
act
of
lawlessness
which
if
carried
to
its
legitimate
ends
would
destroy
our
government
and
damn
our
civilization
and
in
making
this
statement
i
ask
for
neither
the
protection
of
my
friends
nor
the
mercy
of
my
if
all
other
white
ministers
were
to
take
such
fearless
and
open
stands
against
such
savage
doings
that
are
heaping
as
much
shame
and
stain
on
the
united
states
as
such
crimes
in
europe
ever
heaped
on
turkey
they
could
in
a
few
years
make
these
united
states
a
truly
christian
land
and
in
taking
such
stands
such
ministers
if
they
showed
the
same
kind
of
faith
in
god
as
rev
shuler
did
who
is
still
living
and
preaching
they
would
also
be
delivered
from
a
threatening
mob
but
where
within
the
recent
past
or
the
present
have
there
stepped
out
from
the
white
ministry
two
rev
shulers
among
all
the
nationally
famed
white
evangelists
which
one
or
three
of
recent
times
have
in
preaching
in
all
parts
of
the
united
states
proved
himself
a
second
henry
ward
beecher
an
elijah
lovejoy
or
a
torry
who
fearlessly
and
fruitfully
preached
against
all
national
as
well
as
local
sins
crimes
and
lawlessness
that
came
under
their
notice
among
all
the
white
ministers
in
the
united
states
only
they
themselves
can
tell
how
many
of
them
peacefully
feel
within
their
secret
hearts
and
contentedly
feel
within
their
reasoning
minds
that
they
are
giving
full
reverences
to
god
full
honor
to
their
calling
and
full
service
toward
all
weak
and
suffering
humanity
through
their
sunday
preachings
against
all
sins
and
crimes
and
among
them
only
they
can
tell
how
many
of
them
through
advising
words
in
reasoning
talks
are
trying
each
sunday
if
only
for
five
minutes
to
blow
out
and
drown
the
sinful
sparks
of
jealousy
envy
malice
and
hate
that
instantly
flame
up
in
the
breasts
of
so
many
of
their
church
members
as
soon
as
they
see
a
colored
person
even
if
that
person
is
and
such
feelings
merely
on
account
of
color
are
not
natural
and
god
has
not
meant
for
such
to
be
for
if
he
had
he
would
have
made
the
brown
earth
white
the
green
grass
white
the
blue
sky
white
the
yellow
sun
white
these
are
the
greatest
things
in
the
world
and
all
of
them
are
colored
even
the
water
that
covers
of
the
earth
while
it
is
supposed
to
be
colorless
is
more
colored
than
it
is
white
those
white
people
who
wish
that
there
were
no
colored
on
earth
should
remember
that
god
in
his
infinite
wisdom
fully
realized
in
making
the
universe
that
if
he
made
all
things
white
the
glare
would
be
so
great
and
intense
that
every
seeing
thing
would
be
driven
totally
blind
so
god
put
soft
and
blending
colors
on
earth
in
order
that
humanity
might
retain
its
sight
to
see
his
works
and
learn
to
love
them
but
not
to
look
upon
any
of
his
works
with
scorn
and
hatefulness
while
intelligent
preachers
of
the
race
upon
quietly
and
carefully
looking
about
them
see
that
practically
the
entire
earth
is
one
mass
of
colors
the
majority
of
internal
and
external
earth
elements
the
foods
the
clothes
inside
and
outside
building
materials
and
furnishings
are
colored
yet
these
negro
ministers
teach
their
congregations
that
the
white
color
god
has
placed
here
has
as
much
right
on
earth
as
the
big
majority
of
colors
and
there
are
such
advising
and
logical
talks
going
on
every
sunday
from
the
colored
pulpits
in
order
to
keep
down
race
prejudice
and
friction
and
colored
ministers
are
silently
and
hopefully
praying
to
god
that
he
will
finally
soften
melt
and
move
the
hearts
of
the
white
ministers
so
that
they
will
at
last
come
forward
and
do
their
parts
by
logic
reasonings
with
their
white
congregations
a
few
minutes
every
sunday
regarding
the
rights
of
all
colors
of
peoples
to
live
unmolested
and
progress
unhindered
here
on
earth
it
has
been
left
for
the
white
press
to
come
forward
and
take
the
lead
which
it
is
nobly
and
increasingly
doing
in
this
movement
of
reasoning
with
the
masses
of
white
people
in
america
regarding
racial
discriminations
and
injustices
but
the
entire
world
including
the
american
white
press
itself
is
looking
on
in
puzzled
and
wondering
silence
as
it
continues
to
hopefully
wait
for
the
american
white
ministry
to
dutifully
and
courageously
come
forward
in
a
mass
and
take
its
rightful
lead
in
this
christian
movement
to
help
bring
about
a
closer
brotherhood
a
truer
christlike
understanding
and
a
smoother
racial
adjustment
between
the
white
and
colored
people
living
in
the
united
states
the
influence
of
the
white
church
is
the
greatest
human
power
in
the
world
it
unintentionally
encourages
mobs
and
rioting
in
america
by
continuing
to
keep
silent
on
the
question
but
it
can
intentionally
discourage
and
prevent
in
a
very
short
time
the
occurence
of
a
second
arkansas
atlanta
chester
chicago
duluth
east
louis
houston
philadelphia
tulsa
washington
and
other
race
riots
if
it
will
come
out
as
a
whole
all
over
the
country
and
speak
to
its
congregations
sunday
after
sunday
against
such
barbarism
and
heathenism
being
constantly
carried
on
here
in
the
united
states
according
to
notices
that
have
recently
appeared
in
the
white
press
the
federal
council
of
the
churches
of
christ
in
america
spurred
on
by
the
barbarisms
carried
on
at
the
riot
of
tulsa
of
a
few
months
ago
has
boldly
come
forward
and
denounced
such
sins
and
crimes
in
order
to
bring
about
better
relations
between
the
two
races
and
help
to
prevent
such
future
occurences
this
council
has
already
appointed
a
commission
that
has
held
a
meeting
in
washington
it
is
planned
to
hold
conferences
composed
of
white
and
colored
clergymen
all
over
the
country
and
an
effort
will
be
made
to
have
the
white
churches
to
educate
their
audiences
regarding
the
sins
of
race
prejudice
and
the
crimes
resulting
therefrom
so
just
as
god
in
his
own
time
answered
the
prayers
of
american
slaves
that
they
and
their
children
would
some
day
become
free
he
is
gradually
and
surely
answering
the
prayers
of
persecuted
negroes
of
today
that
the
white
ministry
will
come
forward
and
take
its
proper
place
as
a
leader
in
helping
to
swing
into
the
right
channels
the
public
sentiments
of
white
people
regarding
their
christlike
treatments
of
colored
neighbors
colored
people
must
continue
to
work
and
pray
and
be
hopeful
that
out
of
this
movement
will
eventually
come
a
second

aside
from
the

list
of
colored
ministers
there
are
many
thousands
of
others
whose
names
the
writer
did
not
get
in

who
are
known
to
be
faithfully
serving
on
similar

smaller

none

less
important
scales

from

does
easter
get
its
blend
in
life
of
plants
and
men
and
thus
the
two
will
ever
trend
while
god
with
love
the
world
does
tend
new
life
and
hope
in
spring
are
seen
as
fields
unfold
their
rugs
of
green
where
robins
bold
in
songs
serene
strut
forth
in
cheer
that
is
supreme
fresh
is

with

are

pious

always
tell

they

in

young
crops
on
farms
have
just
begun
to
feel
the
warmth
of
golden
sun
that
sends
its
beams
to
dance

run
with
little
babes
in
play

fun
up
from
the
mire

black
room
white
lilies
rise
in
purest
bloom
to
drive
away
all
tainted
gloom
and
leave
on
earth
their
sweet
perfume
thus
did
our
christ
from
manger
start
and
served
the
role
of
jesus
part
thence
on
the
cross
to
give
his
heart
in
pay
for
sins
that
must
depart
so
to
our
minds
is
always
borne
that
every
man
can
shed
his
thorn

did
our
christ
so
bruised

torn

in

in

except
the

life
is
there
a
more
suitable
or
fruitful
place
in
which
to
spiritually
nourish
and
grow
up
colored
youths
than
in
the
thousand
or
more
colored
sunday
schools
where
over
two
million
boys
and
girls
are
regularly
having
impressed
upon
their
tender
and
open
minds
the
religious
teachings
of
the
bible
as
a
step
toward
further
broadening
the
sunday
school
work

children
and
at
the
same
time
enabling
them
to
get
better
teachings
about
the
christian
religion
the
international

began
in

organize

training
sunday
school
teachers
among
the
young
men

attending
colored
colleges
and
large

many

became
interested

this
good
movement
especially

who
gave
of
his
own
personal
money
to
pay
the
expenses
of
a
fair
trial
of
the
work
this
christian
effort
has
aroused
so
much
interest
and
has
grown
so
rapidly
that
at
present
upward
of
two
hundred
colored
universities
colleges
and
large
schools
have
accepted
and
given
this
sunday
school
teachers
course
a
regular
place

some

the

leaderships
of

among

in

given
opportunity
to
the
colored
woman
to
prove
her
ability
for
leadership
she
had
her
chance
and
she
made
good
with
all
the
strength
of
having
suffered
she
will
be
able
through
the
patience
born
of
suffering
to
lead
the
women

whom
only
she
can
lead
the
time
is
past
for
white
leadership
for

as
white

we
must
understand
each
other
we
must
think
and
work
and

together
for

rests
the

julius
rosenwald

made
an
offer
in

give
the

subscription

the
construction
of
a
building

throughout

far
back
as
had
already
decided

carefully
planned
to
gather
and
form
some
kind
of
a
national
body
among
themselves
they
were
indeed
suddenly
inspired
to
and
fearlessly
carry
out
those
plans
immediately
when
a
prejudiced
white
editor
of
a
village
paper
in
the
united
states
published
an
open
letter
in
which
he
accused
alike
all
american
colored
women
as
being
without
moral
characters
and
uplifting
principles
not
only
the
educated
refined
and
moral
colored
women
resented
and
challenged
that
letter
that
had
lied
on
and
slandered
a
whole
race
of
their
sisters
but
the
largest
nationally
known
white
newspapers
of
large
cities
in
both
america
and
europe
came
out
in
editorials
verbally
chastising
and
denouncing
without
mercy
that
editor
of
their
race
who
stained
his
profession
and
shamed
his
race
by
stooping
so
low
in
unsuccessfully
using
that
and
means
of
gaining
subscriptions
for
his
failing
paper
and
fame
for
his
unheard
of
name
as
a
result
of
the
above
plans
and
decisions
nearly
a

son
of

washington
while
the

has
a
distinctive
purpose
that
of
promoting
the
commercial
and
financial
development
of
our
race
it
does
not
attempt
to
prescribe
for
every
racial
endeavor
yet
it
is
a
significant
fact
that
through
the
instrumentality
of
this
the
national
body
and
its
more
than
local
branches
or
local
leagues
scattered
throughout
the
country
a
very
large
part
of
the
progress
made
by
the
race
in
the
direction
of
home
and
farm
ownership
banking
insurance
manufacturing
and
mercantile
enterprises
has
been
achieved
since
the
organization
of
the
business
league
among
the
many
subjects
discussed
are
such
as
making
farming
pay
building
a
negro
town
the
relation
of
education
to
business
conducting
a
grocery
store
editing
a
newspaper
and
many
others
which
space
will
not
permit
me
to
mention
here
questions
are
asked
and
in
that
way
those
who
did
not
come
up
to
their
expectations
the
previous
year
try
when
they
return
to
their
various
communities
as
far
as
possible
to
put
into
practice
what
they
have
gained
through
the
league
the
symposiums
conducted
in
the
main
convention
by
the
following
organizations
are
highly
interesting
and
instructive
the
national
negro
bankers
association
the

negro
funeral
directors
association
the

negro
press
the

men
finally
as
a
race
we
must
not
be
discouraged
there
will
come
to
us
as
to
all
races
seasons
of
depression
and
gloom
once
in
a
while
even
those
in
high
places
may
seem
to
seek
to
insult
humiliate
and
harass
us
but
they
can
not
last
the
morning
those
who
treat
us
unjustly
are
losing
more
than
we
are
above
all
we
must
not
lose
faith
in
ourselves
nor
in
our
race
we
must
be
as
proud
of
being
negroes
as
a
japanese
is
of
being
a
japanese
it
is
through
such
meetings
as
the

that
the

the
national
equal

league
was
started
in
and
one
of
its
chief
purposes
is
contending
for
and
securing
in
peaceful
but
firm
ways
the
same
equal
rights
in
the
united
states
for
american
colored
citizens
as
those
so
generously
given
to
members
of
other
races
especially
many
foreigners
in
this
country
who
do
not
understand
the
laws
can
not
speak
the
language
and
have
no
intentions
of
becoming
naturalized
the

assisted
by
such

as

the
lincoln
league
of
america
is
an
organization
that
was
started
in
and
one
of
its
main
objects
is
to
instil
race
pride
on
a
broader
scale
among
colored
people
and
at
the
same
time
encourage
them
along
all
lines
of

and
advancement
roscoe

is
president

is
nobly

this
work
by
such
national
figures

schools
the
national
association
of
teachers
for
colored
schools
is
under
the
scholarly
and
experienced
leadership
of
gandy
it
is
due
mostly
to
this
organization
that
the
managements
and
sentiments
of
the
different
southern
colored
colleges
and
schools
have
come
to
better
understand
each
other
and
thereby
work
in
closer
conjunction
and
harmony
for
the
broadest
and
most
practical
development
of
negro
youths
in
both
industrial
and
higher
education
other

who
have
helped
to
bring
about
such
good
feelings
are

negro
organization
society
although
it
has
not
yet
developed
into
a
national
organization
the
negro
organization
society
of
virginia
is
making
rapid
strides
in
that
direction
it
was
organized
several
years
ago
at
the
wise
suggestion
of
the
late
frissell
by
major
moton
who
with
the
valuable
assistance
of
captain
allen
washington
profs
gandy
erwin
rev
a
graham
lawyer
walker
hon
robert
clay
and
others
soon
made
it
a
leading
source
of
encouragement
and
helpfulness
throughout
the
entire
state
while
its
purpose
is
to
unite
into
one
large
solid
body
for
more
mutual
understandings
all
the
church
fraternal
and
social
organizations
and
societies
big
and
little
in
the
state
it
has
no
desires
nor
intentions
whatever
of
selfishly
absorbing
within
itself
or
taking
away
the
individuality
of
any
organized
body
that
comes
under
its
advice
and
help
one
of
the
chief
objects
of
this
society
is
to
gather
all
such
organizations
in
the
state
under
its
guiding
wisdom
and
sheltering
arms
into
one
big
congenial
family
whose
members
may
then
be
constantly
taught
how
best
to
work
in
helpful
understandings
and
harmony
among
themselves
and
in
brotherhood
with
their
white
neighbors
in
order
to
secure
better
health
better
schools
better
homes
and
better
farms
for
the
colored
people
these
efforts
have
proven
so
fruitful
that
this
society
has
already
overflown
its
virginian
cup
of
uplift
influence
that
is
now
running
and
dripping
over
the
sides
into
surrounding
states
and
under
the
continued
successful
campaigns
of
its
present
leader
major
allen
washington
this
organ
is
destined
some
day
to
become
one
of
the
most
helpful
national
movements
in
america
in
aiding
to
bring
about
stronger
and
broader
feelings
between
the
two
races
and
at
the
same
time
more
friendly
and
solidly
uniting
all
colored
organizations
for
a
more
rapid
and
advancement
of
the
negro
race
the
congress
on
february
dubois
editor
of
the
crisis
called
a
meeting
known
as
the
congress
that
held
three
days
session
in
the
grand
hotel
paris
france
it
was
attended
by
delegates
representing
sixteen
different
negro
groups
who
passed
resolutions
of
which
two
of
the
most
important
paragraphs
are
quoted
below
as
follows
whenever
persons
of
african
descent
are
civilized
and
able
to
meet
the
tests
of
surrounding
culture
they
shall
be
accorded
the
same
rights
as
their
fellow
citizens
they
shall
not
be
denied
on
account
of
race
or
color
a
voice
in
their
own
government
justice
before
the
courts
and
economic
and
social
equality
according
to
ability
and
desert
whenever
it
is
proven
that
african
natives
are
not
receiving
just
treatment
at
the
hands
of
any
state
or
that
any
state
deliberately
excludes
its
civilized
citizens
or
subjects
of
negro
descent
from
its
body
politic
and
cultural
it
shall
be
the
duty
of
the
league
of

to
bring
the
matter
to
the
attention
of
the
civilized

after

in

according
to
the
july
issue
of
the
crisis
the
chief
working
plans
mapped
out
on
the
practical
progress
of
this
congress
are
as
follows
to
satisfy
the
urgent
need
of
securing
information
about
africa
s
physical
climatic
and
commercial
conditions
as
well
as
the
attitude
of
the
natives
and
the
european
governments
to
thresh
such
newly
gained
knowledge
and
put
it
into
the
form
of
a
statement
presenting
the
main
social
problems
which
face
the
negros
of
the
world
to
enable
the
leaders
of
the
different
negro
groups
the
world
over
to
become
acquainted
to
get
in
touch
with
and
put
before
those
persons
groups
nations
and
organizations
of
various
races
who
either
do
sympathize
with
the
peoples
of
africa
and
their
descendants
or
who
would
sympathize
with
them
if
they
knew
the
fundamental
characteristics
needs
and
deserts
of
the
black
man
all
over
the
globe
to
have
the
congress
finally
evolved
into
one
permanent
body
that
welds
the
negro
people
and
their
friends
for
the
emancipation
of
the
race
for
his
services
in
originating
and
conducting
in
paris
the
congress
dubois
was
presented
with
the
spingarn
medal
and
this
congress
in
the
judgment
of
president
hope
of
morehouse
college
made
the
negro
representatives
from
seventeen
countries
discover
that
the
problems
of
colored
people
the
world
over
are
the
the
origin
and
purpose
of
the
above
mentioned
spingarn
medal
is
explained
in
the
following
quotation
a
few
years
ago
spingarn
of
new
york
decided
that
he
would
offer
each
year
a
gold
medal
to
be
awarded
to
the
man
or
woman
of
african
descent
who
had
rendered
valuable
though
perhaps
somewhat
inconspicuous
service
to
his
race
and
to
modern
civilization
spingarn
had
very
clearly
in
his
mind
the
for
merit
type
of
decoration
this
idea
has
always
been
kept
before
the
committee
on
award
ref
july
issue
of
the
southern
workman
a
complete
list
of
those
who
have
been
awarded
the
spingarn
medal
since
when
it
was
first
presented
up
to
the
present
date
is
as
follows
ernest

colonel

harry
burleigh
wm
stanley
braithwaite
archibald

duboise
charles

celebrated

marcus
garvey
whatever
may
be
their
private
thoughts
and
judgements
as
to
the
methods
purposes
and
final
results
of
his
efforts
the
one
conclusion
at
which
close
observing
colored
and
white
people
alike
have
unanimously
arrived
and
publically
admitted
is
that
the
negro
marcus
garvey
who
is
estimated
to
have
united
more
than
a
million
of
his
race
people
into
different
organizations
has
unquestionably
become
the
world
s
greatest
group
organizer
of
today
relative
to
the
race
interests
efforts
and
leaderships
of
dubois
and
garvey
the
writer
quotes
below
the
very
logical
and
impartial
editorial
that
appeared
in
editor
finley
wilson
s
washington
eagle
that
was
published
september
in
washington
world
league
of
the
african
races
necessary
we
are
very
much
in
favor
of
the
movement
which
dubois
has
in
charge
and
is
trying
to
make
a
success
of
the
race
needs
an
international
organization
which
will
gather
representatives
of
the
african
peoples
of
the
world
where
their
rights
and
wrongs
may
be
registered
and
looked
after
and
where
annually
they
may
gather
in
an
open
congress
or
a
discussion
and
agreement
upon
questions
affecting
them
the
question
is
a
broad
one
and
should
be
considered
from
that
viewpoint
on
the
other
hand
we
are
very
much
in
favor
of
the
movement
fostered
by
marcus
garvey
the
provisional
president
of
africa
to
create
a
sentiment
in
africa
in
favor
of
a
oneness
of
sentiment
among
africans
themselves
and
the
building
up
of
african
states
for
africans
garvey
has
been
pointing
out
recently
and
very
wisely
we
think
that
the
time
may
come
when
who
are
dissatisfied
with
their
conditions
in
states
of
the
united
states
may
desire
to
go
to
africa
and
to
a
state
in
africa
governed
by
africans
this
is
reasonable
foresight
there
are
millions
of
jews
working
hard
for
the
rehabilitation
of
palestine
who
have
no
desire
to
make
it
their
home
as
they
are
satisfied
in
the
states
where
they
are
but
there
are
millions
who
are
not
satisfied
as
in
turkey
and
russia
who
would
go
to
palestine
and
build
its
waste
places
while
repatriating
it
it
is
in
the
same
way
that
we
regard
the
building
of
a
strong
african
state
as
a
sufficient
asylum
of
those
of
the
race
who
are
persecuted
anywhere
on
the
globe
that
they
may
be
mr
garvey
is
as
much
of
a
prophet
in
his
way
as
dubois
and
we
should
be
willing
to
hold
up
the
hands
of
both
of
them
in
any
plans
they
may
advance
which
seems
possible
of
working
out
for
the
good
of
the
race
both
of
them
have
ideas
and
methods
we
do
not
approve
but
that
would
be
the
case
with
any
movement
whatsoever
that
may
be
started
on
a
large
or
small
scale
by
any
man
or
group
of
men
of
the
race
but
it
should
not
prevent
us
from
encouraging
them
in
any
idea
or
plan
which
appears
reasonable
and
possible
of
resulting
in
good
for
the
race
a
world
league
of
african
people
is
necessary
an
independent
african
state
in
africa
is
necessary
we
already
have
liberia
and
abyssinia
but
we
need
more
than
these
and
stronger
than
both
of
on
the
farm
education
the
negro
needs
all
wild

first
learned
to

agricultural
education
in
building

they
found
industrial
education
then
exchange

university

since
the
raising
of
tobacco
cotton
corn
sugar
cane
and
other
farm
products
had
been
the
main
reason
for
starting
slavery
in
america
it
is
plainly
seen
that
farming
was
the
chief
work
of
the
colored
people
until
they
were
set
free
and
it
is
quite
natural
that
they
took
a
great
dislike
to
a
work
that
they
had
been
compelled
to
do
against
their
wills
for
over
two
hundred
years
so
at
the
close
of
the
civil
war
when
they
were
free
to
choose
their
own
work
the
majority
of
were
willing
to
do
any
kind
of
labor
under
the
sun
or
over
the
sun
for
that
matter
but
work
on
the
farm
such
a
state
of
affairs
continued
for
a
number
of
years
and
caused
much
of
the
rich
fertile
lands
in
the
south
to
go
unfarmed
neglected
and
but
after
some
years
away
from
the
only
kind
of
work
they
knew
the
most
about
their
dislike
to
farming
began
to
lessen
and
they
gradually
drifted
back
to
work
patches
of
land
on
shares
with
their
former
owners
who
had
survived
the
war
and
their
return
to
the
bosom
of
nature
rapidly
increased
as
the
saw
how
it
would
enable
them
to
make
a
living
and
save
money
to
buy
land
for
themselves
as
a
result
of
that
movement
back
to
the
farms
which
continued
to
increase
there
were
according
to
the
census
over
two
hundred
thousand
farms
or
million
acres
of
land
owned
in
the
united
states
by
colored
people
negroes
in
the
south
alone
own
more
than
two
hundred
thousand
of
those
farms
that
are
valued
at
more
than
four

just
in
the
state
of

colored

over
one

a
new

rekindled
enthusiasm
and
extra
efforts
have
been
aroused
among
colored
farmers
in
all
parts
of
the
country
they
have
at
last
been
made
to
plainly
see
and
fully
understand
that
it
is
always
to
their
seemingly
dull
country

gates
that
the
and
learned

men
of
the
cities
must
sooner
of
later
turn
for
their
ham
and
eggs
steak
and
chops
bread
and
butter
and
different
vegetables
these
same
farmers
manfully
realize
that
they
or
others
can
only
produce
such
necessities
of
life
by
daily
mingling
among
the
neighing
horses
the
mooing
cows
the
grunting
pigs
the
bleating
sheep
the
cackling

the

they

be

for
what
is
so
fragrant
so
refreshing

so
sweet

early

accord
with
their
special
agricultural
training
than
any
place
in
america
with
the
exception
of
the
south
and
whenever
any
of
those
colored
farmers
arrived
in
california
for
instance
without
money
to
buy
a
few
acres
of
land
they
at
once
hired
themselves
out
to
farmers
without
any
fear
of
southern
peonage
systems
and
in
a
little
while
had
saved
enough
money
to
strike
out
for
themselves
during
the
time
they
served
as
farm
laborers
they
were
able
to
get
practical
and
valuable
experience
in
three
ways
through
experimenting
they
got
acquainted
with
the
western
crops
that
were
new
to
them
they
got
acquainted
with
the
customs
and
habits
of
the
people
and
they
had
time
to
carefully
and
slowly
investigate
many
sections
of
the
country
before
selecting
the
plot
of
land
and
district
in
which
they
planned
to
later
and
permanently
settle
the
following
two
quotations
are
parts
of
articles
written
by
governor
wm
stephens
and
secretary
of
state
frank
jordan
of
california
and
which
articles
appeared
in
the
april
issue
of
the
california
free
lance
that
has
since
been
absorbed
into
the
california
voice
the
reading
of
these
quotations
may
be
of
interest
to
those
concerned
governor
stephens
said
workers
are
what
we
need
and
opportunity
was
never
so
widely
open
to
the
negro
as
it
is
today
a
very
large
number
of
colored
workers
are
well
fitted
for
farm
labor
and
it
would
be
better
for
them
and
a
measure
of
aid
to
our
agricultural
interests
if
they
could
be
diverted
from
the
cities
into
the
country
the
farm
laborer
situation
is
difficult
in
this
state
and
steps
might
well
be
taken
to
shift
to
the
country
those
colored
men
who
are
residing
in
large
cities
under
conditions
unsuited
to
them
our
negro
workers
could
themselves
help
to
solve
this
problem
any
effort
initiated
on
their
part
undoubtedly
would
meet
with
active
encouragement
some
adaptation
to
new
conditions
would
be
necessary
but
this
could
easily
be
brought
about
through
between
negro
workers
and
the
employing
farmers
of
our
state
i
regard
this
matter
of
shifting
workers
who
are
misplaced
in
cities
to
the
farms
of
our
state
as
a
matter
of
importance
and
i
invite
the
earnest
attention
of
the
negro
people
to
it
as
one
primarily
in
their
interest
as
well
as
being
for
the
best
interest
of
our
secretary
of
state
jordan
said
in
part
california
today
has
need
of
farmers
and
farm
laborers
there
is
a
general
alarm
felt
by
persons
acquainted
with
farming
conditions
at
the
shortage
of
laborers
the
farmer
or
farm
laborer
has
a
comfortable
living
under
conditions
and
the
money
he
makes
he
can
save
he
is
an
independent
producer
and
plays
a
most
important
part
in
the
national
welfare
the
california
lands
are
marvels
of
richness
truck
gardening
fruit
orchards
wheat
and
rice
fields
cotton
lands
in
fact
nearly
all
farm
culture
can
be
found
in
this
state
the
important
question
at
present
is
where
are
we
to
find
laborers
to
increase
and
intensify
cultivation
immigration
from
european
countries
has
practically
ceased
mexican
labor
is
difficult
and
uncertain
we
can
only
hope
for
laborers
to
come
from
the
more
thickly
settled
parts
of
the
country
the
youth
of
today
needs
to
be
educated
not
only
in
the
technique
of
farming
but
also
in
the
advantages
of
farm
life
the
prosperity
of
the
nation
rests
largely
on
the
agricultural
workers
the
city
dwellers
can
not
reduce
the
high
cost
of
living
without
the
farmer
s
in
increased
production
the
factory
worker
depends
upon
the
farmer
for
food
his
high
wages
mean
little
to
him
unless
food
is
plentiful
let
a
young
man
consider
carefully
the
opportunities
offered
by
country
as
well
as
civic
life
the
sturdy
independence
the
healthful
surroundings
the
wholesome
food
of
the
former

he
decides
what
his

recent
reports
from
various
sections
of
the
state
show
that
there
are
now
over
negroes
engaged
in
agricultural
forestry
and
animal
husbandry
in
this
in
his
annual
report
of
february
secretary
houston
of
the
department
of
agriculture
pointed
out
that
when
both
the
acreage
and
yield
per
acre
are
taken
into
account
the
american
farmer
leads
the
world
in
individual
production
of
crops
he
further
pointed
out
that
the
aggregate
value
of
all
crops
raised
in
the
united
states
for
that
year
amounted
to
over
fifteen
billion
dollars
these
facts
are
truly
very
encouraging
and
complimentary
to
the
american
farmer
and
are
quite
apt
to
give
him
somewhat
of
a
until
he
reads
social
aspects
of
the
decreasing
food
surplus
in
the
united
this
is
a
agricultural
survey
written
by
one
of
america
s
best
authorities
on
that
subject
bernhard
ostrolenk
director
of
the
national
farm
school
at
farm
school
one
of
the
most
startling
facts
and
timely
warnings
he
brings
out
in
his
survey
is
that
three
million
farms
in
the
united
states
are
idle
on
account
of
the
american
people
not
developing
their
unimproved
lands
in
writing
about
the
already
improved
lands
and
abandoned
farms
he
says
in
part
and
now
we
come
to
the
most
serious
aspect
of
the
agricultural
situation
in
the
united
states
for
the
period
of
to
more
than
two
and
a
half
million
people
left
the
country
to
go
to
the
cities
double
that
figure
could
safely
be
assumed
to
be
the
true
situation
from
to
a
tragedy
is
facing
the
country
scarcity
of
food
means
dissatisfaction
unrest
riots
mob
rule
anarchy
instead
of
proud
boasting
when
new
acquisitions
are
made
in
our
cities
new
apprehensions
for
the
future
food
supply
should
be
aroused
can
the
nation
afford
to
be
indifferent
to
the
farmer
much
longer
we
need
an
exodus
from
our
congested
districts
back
to
the
soil
and
the
national
farm
school
is
ready
to
lead
in
that
movement
we
have
proved
that
it
can
be
done
by
taking
raw
city
youths
and
training
them
to
be
successful
farmers
per
cent
of
our
graduates
own
and
operate
their
own
in
giving
out
this
advice
and
information
of
deep
thought
and
timely
warning
ostrolenk
has
meant
for
it
to
apply
to
and
benefit
the
great
masses
of
colored
people
who
are
jammed
in
the
cities
living
in
unsanitary
courts
and
alleys
as
he
has
meant
for
it
to
influence
the
masses
of
his
own
people
who
have
left
the
country
for
the
cities
and
in
putting
a
last
spread
on
this
subject
the
writer
can
truthfully
say
that
just
as
the
national
farm
school
under
the
direction
of
ostrolenk
is
taking
the
lead
among
other
white
agricultural
schools
in
helping
to
solve
this
great
problem
by
turning
out
such
efficient
white
farmers
so
are
hampton
institute
under
the
guidance
of
jas
gregg
and
tuskegee
institute
under
the
leadership
of
robt
moton
gladly
and
joining
hands
with
the
national
farm
school
in
helping
to
bring
about
this
movement
by
taking
the
lead
among
other
negro
agricultural
schools
in
turning
out
practically
and
scientifically
trained
colored
farmers
young
men
who
wish
to
take
a
scientific
course
in
agriculture
but
hesitate
to
do
so
because
they
fear
their
race
and
color
will
prevent
them
from
getting
sales
for
their
products
should
remember
that
the
greatest
and
only
food
supplier
in
the
world
the
earth
is
colored
and
that
no
race
of
people
ever
attempts
to
wean
itself
from
sucking
its
daily
nourishments
from
nature
s
nippled
breasts
just
because
those
breasts
are
made
of
the
brown
colored
dust
and
dirt
from
which
all
crops
must
come

at

were
made
for
saturday
roves
among
the

half
that

we

tramping
over

we
saw
a

fenced
in
with
rails
and
there
tree
limbs
were
bending
down
thick
with
burs
all
big
and
round
then
we
raced
by
rocky
juts
until
we
spied
the
brownish
nuts
peeping
down
from
sticky
burs
smooth
inside
as
softest

boys
shook
boughs

rained

we
climbed

we
sat

to
learn

founder
of
the
wonderful
school
tuskegee
was
the
greatest
agricultural
and
industrial
leader
of
his
race
in

so
robert
moton
former
educator
at
hampton
institute
and
present
principal
of
tusgkee
institute
is
today
the
foremost
leader
of
the
american
colored
people
in
industrial
and
agricultural
education
and
the
tireless
efforts
and
uplifting
influence
of
those
two
great
industrial
leaders
have
either
originated
or
greatly
encouraged
and
advanced
much
of
the
skilled
industrial
and
intensive
agricultural
progress
made
by
the
colored
people
in
america
during
the
past
thirty
or
more
years
but
the
pioneer
and
greatest
industrial
educator
of
them
all
was
general
samuel
chapman
armstrong
who
founded
in
the
famous
hampton
institute
which
is
said
to
be
the
leading
school
of
its
kind
in
america
and
among
the
best
in
the
world
for
years
not
even
many
intelligent
white
and
colored
people
looked
with
kindly
favor
upon
general
armstrong
s
then
new
and
strange
methods
of
teaching
the
head
the
hand
and
the
heart
to
work
together
for
the
highest
development
of
an
individual
or
a
race
people
then
generally
thought
that
it
was
foolish
to
go
to
school
just
to
learn
the
trades
or
how
to
work
on
a
farm
as
they
had
always
been
taught
that
schools
were
places
where
one
went
to
learn
to
study
books
alone
and
that
was
what
nearly
every
one
wanted
to
do
as
it
was
thought
to
be
a
disgrace
and
dishonor
to
work
with
the
hands
but
many
years
had
not
passed
before
it
was
seen
and
proved
that
general
armstrong
s
methods
were
among
the
most
valuable
educational
teachings
in
the
world
and
today
civilized
countries
throughout
the
world
are
using
in
their
private
public
and
government
schools
vocational
and
industrial
plans
and
methods
copied
after
those
originated
by
the
general
armstrong
and
so
successfully
carried
on
after
his
death
by
hollis
burke
frissell
the
unusual
beneficial
careers
of
those
two
life
long
friends
of
colored
peoples
stand
with
the
foremost
among
the
careers
of
many
brave
white
men
and
women
who
have
not
been
ashamed
to
follow
the
footsteps
of
christ
by
unselfishly
giving
their
lives
and
fortunes
for
the
encouragement
and
uplift
of
an
oppressed
people

apposed

education
of

were
many
of
the
best

who
did
everything
possible
to
elevate
their
colored

northern

willingly
gave
their

and
in

their

for

just
right
not

years
ago
were

in

and
as

of

who
were
in

hundred

this
marvelous
and
successful

the
most
dazzling
banking
achievement
as

as

records
ever
made
in

world
in
the

length

by
a
like
group
of
people
placed
under
the

kind
of
circumstances
in
fact
this
most
heavily
handicapped
business
has
been
made
with
such
sudden
rapidity
length
of
leap
and
landing
that
financial
judges
and
onlookers
of
all
races
are
still
dizzy
from
trying
to
measure
the
distance
and
solve
how
it
was
covered
banking
critics
throughout
the
country
seem
to
agree
in
estimating

norfolk
as
the
foremost
colored

financier
of

through

the

people
throughout

the
following
unusually
successful
business
colored
men
and
women
each
reputed
able
to
write
his
or
her
personal
check
for
thousand
dollars
nearly
all
of
them
have
saved
a
fortune
of
fifty
thousand
dollars
a
large
number
of
them
have
reached
the
one
hundred
thousand

mark
numbers

two

fifty

many
of

count
their

up

five
hundred
thousand

and
quite
a
few
of
them
own
over
a

in

in

say

would
remind
the

that
all

there
are
just
as
successful

wealthy
colored

men

one
of
the
chief
living
conditions
surrounding
the
american
colored
people
that
always
stood
as
a
puzzled
question
to
the
masses
of
american
white
people
was
how
did
negroes
considering
the
low
cheating
wages
until
the
world
war
they
had
always
received
for
their
work
and
the
usually
double
prices
they
were
made
to
pay
in
buying
clothes
furniture
homes
etc
manage
to
keep
up
decent
living
expenses
save
money
and
at
the
same
time
nourishingly
care
for
their
sick
and
properly
bury
their
dead
it
has
never
been
understood
why
so
few
colored
people
have
been
seen
as
beggars
and
paupers
holding
up
every
other
street
corner
or
silently
filling
the
potter
fields
while
these
same
places
have
always
been
with
dependent
white
people
who
in
their
prosperous
life
times
had
received
the
highest
paid
wages
and
given
the
lowest
bargain
sales
when
it
is
remembered
that
there
is
over
ninety
million
caucasians
in
the
united
states
against
twelve
million
negroes
even
then
the
percentage
of
whites
in
such
places
is
much
larger
than
that
of
the
blacks
and
from
the
fact
that
in
nearly
every
large
city
in
america
there
are
to
be
found
white
men
and
women
who
own
homes
and
thousands
of
dollars
and
still
beg
on
street
corners
proves
that
begging
is
easier
and
comes
more
natural
to
white
than
to
colored
people
because
no
instance
has
ever
been
heard
of
a
negro
street
begging
when
owning
a
home
or
money
in
a
bank
now
the
facts
that
answer
the
puzzled
question
as
to
how
negroes
have
always
been
able
to
get
along
generally
under
all
circumstances
are
the
insurance
companies
fraternal
orders
and
beneficial
societies
founded
and
operated
by
colored
people
in
america
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
including
death
that
the
average
colored
people
dread
more
than
to
face
downright
poverty
need
and
beggary
and
to
prevent
such
misfortunes
they
become
full
members
in
these
organizations
even
from
childhood
for
this
reason
insurance
enterprises
have
proven
to
be
one
of
the
most
congenial
occupations
quickest
surest
and
best
paying
business
into
which
negro
business
men
have
so
far
ventured
on
the
other
hand
the
founders
and
managers
of
these
companies
have
taken
full
advantage
of
their
opportunities
to
give
to
the
masses
of
people
in
their
companies
a
timely
practical
and
material
helpfulness
that
is
surpassed
by
no
other
group

and
still
a
widely
read
contributor
to

of

this
pioneer

who
was
at
one

right

man
to

great
white
journalist
chas
dana
who
bought
and
revived
the
moribund
new

in

absorbed
into

monthly
a

he
first
began
to
publish
in
there
are
yet
living
today
many
older
men
and
women
who
can
vividly
recall
from
personal
observation
how
that
great
orator
reformer
statesman
and
journalist
could
in
a
column
on
his
editorial
page
wield
a
pungent
pen
against
the
enemy
of
his
race
so
forcefully
by
turning
out
polished
and
gentlemanly
invective
articles
that
neither
feared
nor
spared
but
manfully
denounced
and
exposed
those
who
held
or
upheld
slavery
and
in
another
column
on
that
same
editorial
page
he
could
just
as
ably
use
an
unsurpassed
tactful
ability
in
penning
mutual
and
grateful
paragraphs
to
the
loyal
friends
of
his
race
who
were
at
once
more
strongly
allied
to
his
side
or
he
could
in
a
third
column
just
as
diplomatically
word
a
concilatory
to
the
whites
who
after
thoroughly
reading
and
thoughtfully
thinking
over
his
and
convincing
sentences
were
usually
completely
persuaded
to
friendly
join
his
cause
for
the
freedom
of
his
people
and
the
increasing
denouncements
and
criticisms
that
are
read
in
the
northern
white
press
against
the
present
barbarous
peonage
systems
carried
on
in
the
south
today
are
but
very
very
faint
echoes
of
the
clarion
and
stenotorian
thunderings
that
electrically
flashed
roared
and
rumbled
seventy
years
ago
throughout
the
world
from
the
columns
of
the
north
star
or
from
the
actual
lips
of
fred
douglass
while
lecturing
in
england
ireland
scotland
and
wales
against
the
real
slavery
that
the
south
was
then
savagely
carrying
on
with
his
race

pioneer

line
of
work

the

although
not

three

the
associated
negro
press
of
which
brascher
of

is
is
already
exerting
a
wonderful
influence
in
the
field
of
negro
journalism
and
is
doing
excellent
work
in
so
efficiently
gathering
and
so
promptly
releasing
to
its
newspaper
members
the
most
vital
current
events
of
the
day
the
noble
and
tireless
efforts
of
the
colored
editors
in
trying
to
help
convert
the
prejudiced
white
people
of
the
united
states
from
their
unjust
hatred
discrimination
and
cruelties
upon
the
negro
race
just
because
of
its
progress
are
each
day
being
more
ably
backed
up
by
the
american
white
press
as
the
writer
has
said
in
the
chapter
dealing
with
church
work
white
papers
throughout
the
country
are
increasing
in
numbers
in
making
their
editorials
stronger
and
stronger
in
justly
denouncing
mob
rule
its
results
and
future
reaction
upon
these
united
states
this
sentiment
in
the
white
press
is
increasing
and
spreading
so
rapidly
that
even
white
papers
in
different
parts
of
the
south
are
fearlessly
joining
this
movement
for
right
in
the
summer
of
a
southern
paper
the
san
antonio
express
of
texas
set
aside
a
fund
of
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
to
be
used
in
helping
to
put
down
lynching
in
the
united
states
this
money
is
to
be
used
to
pay
rewards
for
the
arrest
and
conviction
of
all
persons
taking
part
in
lynchings
other
texas
white
papers
the
houston
post
and
the
austin
american
have
on
different
occasions
come
out
strongly
in
contending
for
fair
treatment
and
justice
to
the
colored
people
with
reference
to
the
jury
which
heard
the
evidence
in
the
peonage
trial
of
john
williams
georgia
white
planter
accused
of
killing
eleven
negro
farm
hands
and
on
trial
for
the
slaying
of
one
of
them
and
which
jury
brought
in
a
verdict
of
guilty
with
life
sentence
but
urged
mercy
on
the
court
the
following
editorial
by
thomas
loveless
appeared
in
a
georgia
white
paper
the
according
to
an
article
that
came
out
in
the
april
issue
of
the
chicago
defender
a
newton
county
jury
has
tried
john
williams
the
jasper
county
multimurderer
found
him
guilty
and
recommended
him
to
the
mercy
of
the
court
by
what
process
of
reasoning
the
jury
arrived
at
this
form
of
verdict
is
difficult
if
not
well
nigh
impossible
to
imagine
this
is
if
we
try
to
analyze
it
by
any
process
of
reasoning
but
if
we
brush
aside
all
subterfuge
and
hypocrisy
and
tell
the
plain
truth
about
it
the
verdict
as
great
a
travesty
of
justice
as
it
is
is
not
so
difficult
to
understand
and
this
plain
truth
is
we
have
not
yet
reached
that
stage
of
grace
or
of
justice
in
georgia
where
we
hang
a
white
man
for
killing
a
nigger
as
the
expression
is
and
has
long
been
however
the
owner
and
operator
of
this
georgia
murder
farm
escapes
with
his
own
life
a
penitentiary
sentence
and
perhaps
a
pardon
later
on
if
he
lives
long
enough
and
his
family
can
bring
enough
influence
to
bear
thus
do
we
again
advertise
god
help
referring
to
the
recent
tulsa
oklahoma
race
riot
in
which
the
mob
destroyed
blocks
of
negro
property
the
following
extracts
are
parts
of
an
editorial
that
appeared
in
the
july
issue
of
a
white
newspaper
the
national
tribune
of
washington
the
burning
disgrace
of
race
riot
as
we
have
said
before
there
is
a
strong
element
in
tulsa
coming
from
the
renegade
whites
who
fled
out
of
the
reach
of
justice
to
start
a
race
riot
on
any
pretext
the
more
that
the
situation
is
studied
the
less
provocation
there
was
for
such
an
outrage
the
absurdity
of
the
white
girl
s
story
that
she
had
been
insulted
by
a
negro
boy
was
apparent
on
its
face
it
is
said
her
reputation
was
not
of
the
best
and
no
one
apparently
stopped
to
think
of
the
impossibility
of
such
an
outrage
in
the
most
public
place
in
a
city
of
people
the
elevator
which
she
was
running
was
in
the
most
conspicuous
part
of
the
building
the
riot
was
made
possible
by
the
worthlessness
of
the
police
and
judiciary
as
usual
in
a
place
of
such
sudden
rise
to
greatness
as
tulsa
the
vicious
elements
have
entirely
too
large
a
control
of
the
municipal
authorities
the
houses
of
gambling
joints
bootleggers
and
other
criminals
have
too
much
to
say
as
to
the
selection
of
officials
for
years
tulsa
has
been
in
the
absolute
control
of
this
element
the
better
class
of
people
were
too
much
absorbed
making
the
easy
money
possible
there
to
bother
themselves
and
give
up
any
time
to
politics
quite
a
number
of
negroes
have
made
fortunes
in
tulsa
and
they
became
the
special
objects
of
the
mob
one
colored
man
owned
and
operated
a
printing
plant
with
of
printing
machinery
in
it
it
was
assailed
and
burned
to
the
ground
by
a
mob
led
by
a
man
who
had
been
working
a
linotype
at
a
salary
of
a
week
of
course
this
linotype
man
professed
to
be
a
perfect
southern
gentleman
and
superior
to
a
negro
although
he
degraded
himself
by
working
for
him
at
good
wages
jackson
a
colored
physician
who
was
called
by
competent
authorities
the
most
able
negro
surgeon
in
america
was
marked
for
the
wrath
of
the
mob
because
he
owned
worth
of
property
he
tried
to
fight
against
the
mob
and
surrendered
under
a
pledge
of
protection
but
was
murdered
on
his
way
to
the
above
are
but
a
few
of
the
many
such
editorials
that
have
recently
come
under
the
notice
of
the
writer
and
if
white
editors
who
run
out
such
editorials
could
just
mingle
among
the
masses
of
both
races
where
their
papers
are
read
and
listen
to
the
comments
being
made
they
would
be
amazed
to
note
the
influence
for
good
that
such
writings
are
exerting
and
if
now
in
this
critical
period
of
racial
unrest
the
majority
of
white
editors
through
this
land
together
with
the
white
clergy
will
take
such
stands
for
law
and
order
the
race
prejudice
in
this
country
will
be
checked
before
its
barbarism
pulls
the
united
states
down
down
down
to
the
very
lowest
and
most
despised
race
among
all
nations
and
countries
civilized
and
uncivilized
for
this
unjust
public
sentiment
can
only
be
checked
and
changed
by
the
right
kind
of
influences
starting
from
the
white
pulpits
and
printing
rooms
the
frequent
clashings
of
swords
can
not
force
about
such
a
change
but
the
constant
exchange
of
reasoning
sermons
and
editorials
can
persuade
such
a
change
to
come
about
if
it
is
the
fear
of
losing
their
congregations
and
churches
that
prevents
so
many
white
ministers
from
taking
such
a
stand
then
the
way
to
be
outspoken
instead
of
silent
against
mob
sins
and
crimes
and
still
keep
mrs
wolf
from
grinning
at
them
through
their
parsonage
windows
is
for
all
of
them
to
become
outspoken
and
as
their
people
must
continue
to
have
churches
and
be
preached
to
those
ministers
would
still
hold
their
pulpits
as
they
would
then
be
the
only
kind
of
preachers
outspoken
to
listen
to
if
it
is
the
fear
of
losing
their
subscribers
and
seeing
their
papers
go
into
the
waste
baskets
that
keeps
so
many
white
editors
from
taking
such
a
rightful
stand
then
the
way
to
keep
and
increase
their
subscribers
and
at
the
same
time
keep
mr
wolf
from
sniffing
around
the
kitchen
doors
is
for
all
editors
to
begin
to
use
the
golden
printer
s
guiding
rule
to
measure
out
their
editorials
on
the
race
questions
as
their
people
must
have
newspapers
in
order
to
learn
what
is
going
on
in
the
world
rather
than
get
no
papers
they
would
buy
the
only
kind
the
fair
and
just
that
would
then
be
printed
and
in
using
the
above
methods
in
bringing
about
brotherhood
and
christlike
feelings
between
the
two
races
no
one
would
be
the
loser
but
all
would
be
the
gainers
as
another
witness
and
proof
that
courageously
standing
for
right
and
fearlessly
denouncing
wrong
through
their
convincing
columns
does
not
weaken
but
eventually
strengthens
and
increases
the
influence
of
such
white
periodicals
the
writer
quotes
below
in
part
an
editorial
that
appeared
in
the
september
issue
of
the
nation
a
white
magazine
that
has
been
successfully
published
in
new
york
for
over
fifty
years
during
all
which
time
its
publication
has
continued
to
grow
and
spread
as
the
results
of
just
such
golden
rule
editorials
as
the
following
the
daughter
of
j
webb
prominent
in
financial
and
social
circles
chose
to
marry
a
groom
her
sister
having
previously
married
a
policeman
the
newspapers
sent
around
special
reporters
in
battalions
then
up
spoke
webb
it
s
rotten
that
s
what
i
call
it
rotten
to
tear
a
person
s
life
to
shreds
like
this
and
bring
up
for
the
public
eye
the
affairs
of
one
poor
little
to
which
we
say
a
hearty
amen
but
more
rotten
than
this
outrageous
violation
of
individual
rights
by
the
press
is
the
careless
or
malicious
zest
with
which
certain
papers
especially
in
the
south
publish
stories
from
depraved
or
irresponsible
white
women
accusing
some
black
man
of
a
more
or
less
grave
offense
against
them
every
newspaperman
knows
that
just
such
a
story
started
the
tulsa
riots
as
well
as
those
in
washington
and
in
omaha
yet
here
we
find
on
the
front
pages
of
the
memphis
commercial
appeal
two
circumstantial
stories
of
attack
by
negroes
on
white
women
both
of
them
were
false
as
the
newspaper
itself
admitted
less
conspicuously
next
day
this
sort
of
thing
is
all
too
common
and
not
every
city
has
a
paper
as
bold
as
the
memphis
press
in
denouncing
it
it
is
high
time
for
a
renascence
of
ethical
standards
in
in
magazine
writing
just
as
dubois
is
recognized
as
the
foremost
magazine
writer
in
the
negro
race
not
only
in
america
but
throughout
the
world
it
is
said
he
has
also
made
the
crisis
magazine
of
which
he
is
the
widest
read
colored
magazine
of
its
kind
not
only
in
the
western
but
also
in
the
eastern
hemisphere
it
is
estimated
that
this
magazine
is
read
each
month
by
nearly
four
hundred
thousand
people
among
lettered
colored
women
miss

of

magazine
is
today
recognized
by
the
best
critics
as
a
leading
and
most
versatile

writer
such
wise
timely
and
meatful
articles
as

talk
representation
of
the
american

world
brotherhood
oil
upon

are
among
the
many
writings
that
have
stamped
miss
georgiana
whyte
editor
of
the
women
s
department
of
the
favorite
magazine
as
one
of
the
most
forceful
and
helpful
magazine
writers
among
colored
women
aside
from
long
ago
proving
himself
as
one
of
the
ablest
colored
newspaper
editors
in
the
country
attorney
robt
vann
of
pittsburgh
has
shown
by
the
high
quality
of
his
competitor
magazine
that
as
a
writer
in
this
field
he
is
second
to
none
the
cheerfulness
and
life
that
editor
fenton
johnson
puts
into
his
favorite
magazine
explains
why
it
is
having
such
a
rapid
growth
and
has
become
a
favorite
with
the
colored
readers
not
only
in
its
home
city
of
chicago
but
throughout
the
country
the
inspiring
snap
that
editor
willis
huggins
throws
into
his
upreach
magazine
accounts
for
it
being
so
popular
especially
with
the
younger
and
progressive
element
among
the
colored
readers
who
are
always
benefited
by
such
well
chosen
and
written
articles
the
exceptional
ability
to
so
vividly
portray
human
nature
from
the
viewpoints
of
both
races
when
building
up
stories
is
one
of
the
secrets
that
is
the
cause
of
editor
aubery
bowser
s
rainbow
magazine
being
sought
after
by
all
readers
who
want
to
learn
and
understand
the
inside
life
situations
as
they
really
exist
when
the
two
races
come
in
close
contact
except
those
people
who
personally
go
through
the
tedious
processes
of
a
similar
work
no
one
is
able
to
fully
realize
and
appreciate
the
value
of
the
culled
methodically
complied
instructively
and
tastily
arranged
matter
that
miss
madeline

presents
each

in

under
the
heading
the
in
monthly
compiling
the
tremendous
new

her
department
contains
miss
allison
is
doing
a
grand
and
unique
piece
of
literary
writing
the
workmanship
and
quality
of
which
any
magazine
of
any
race
would
be
proud
to
carry
as
the
results
of
the
deep
thinking
and
outspoken
opinions
that
get
down
to
the
very
core
and
essence
of
the
subjects
handled
by
them
editors
owens
and
chandler
through
the
medium
of
their
magazine
the
messenger
are
fast
mounting
top
rungs
in
their
profession
and
at
the
same
time
attracting
the
wide
attentions
of
and
seasoned
newspaper
and
magazine
people
in
both
races
although
it
has
not
been
founded
very
long
the

magazine
edited
by
hallion
of
richmond
is
attracting
wide
attention
on
account
of
its
instructive
and
helpful
articles
pertaining
to
business
relations
in
their
many
fields
of
activities
the
brownies
book
edited
by
dubois
dill
of
new
york
city
is
something
entirely
new
in
the
field
of
negro
journalism
it
is
a
monthly
magazine
for
children
which
attempts
to
bring
to
them
the
best
in
pictures
and
stories
of
negro
life
the
life
and
deeds
of
famous
men
and
women
of
the
negro
race
the
current
events
of
the
world
told
in
beautiful
language
which
children
can
in
going
out
of
the
way
to
thoughtfully
assert
that
the
brownies
book
should
be
in
every
negro
home
where
there
are
children
the
writer
expresses
such
a
sentiment
not
because
of
being
more
partial
to
this
certain
magazine
and
its
editors
than
to
other
magazines
and
their
editors
but
because
he
is
ever
proud
to
admit
that
he
is
really
cranky
partial
to
any
negro
history
no
matter
under
what
covers
it
may
appear
especially
is
this
true
when
such
history
is
written
as
in
the
brownies
book
in
plain
easy
truthful
and
interesting
english
that
makes
first
and
lasting
impressions
upon
young
and
tender
negro
minds
before
they
are
indelibly
imprinted
and
permanently
poisoned
by
the
devilish
trash
contained
in
underworld
dime
novels
so
youthfully
secured
and
greedily
read
by
unwatched

now
if
after
reading
through
the

pages
of
inspiration
regarding
the

of

writers
some
colored
girls

boys
should
still
lack
courage
because
of
their
color
and
race
to
throw
their
talents
into
such
literary
avenues
they
should
remember
that
the
most
important
thing
about
a
newspaper
magazine
or
book
is
not
its
white
pages
because
such
pages
can
be
and
often
are
colored
but
the
most
important
thing
in
such
a
publication
is
its
print
of
jet
black
letters
and
words
but
if
those
genuine
ethiopian
letters
refused
just
because
of
their
color
to
mingle
with
and
make
lasting
impressions
upon
the
fair
caucasian
pages

peeped

peered

learned
much
of

inexhaustive

therein
and
with

it
is
not
impossible
for
some

scientist
some

becoming

finally
discovering

giving

and

quotation
is
part
of
an
article
that
appeared
in
the
april
issue
of
the
chicago
defender
in
the
various
fields
of
learning
the
race
has
wrought
and
has
its
representatives
but
not
until
now
have
we
had
a
graduate
doctor
of
metaphysics
the
pioneer
in
this
instance
is
adene
minott
founder
and
head
of
the
clio
school
of
mental
sciences
state
street
this
city
while
yet
a
girl
in
her
teens
miss
minott
showed
exceptional
ability
she
graduated
first
in
her
class
from
grammar
school
no
new
york
city
and
won
the
prize
for
general
excellence
from
her
teacher
miss
mary
eaton
miss
minott
then
entered
the
girl
s
technical
high
school
of
that
city
and
after
receiving
necessary
academic
counts
entered
the
mac
donnall
college
of
phrenology
and
psychology
washington
because
she
was
a
race
woman
she
was
not
permitted
to
study
with
the
regular
classes
but
forced
to
take
the
course
by
private
instruction
despite
this
disadvantage
miss
minott
completed
the
studies
in
the
regular
time
graduated
with
honors
and
received
the
degree
of
bachelor
of
philosophy
returning
to
new
york
city
she
next
forced
admittance
into
the
american
institute
of
anthropology
perfecting
herself
as
a
teacher
in
five
branches
of
anthropology
as
follows
phrenology
physiognomy
practical
psychology
physiology
and
anatomy
of
the
brain
when
she
graduated
from
this
institution
as
a
mark
of
distinction
for
an
excellent
record
she
was
presented
with
a
membership
medal
and
received
the
degree
of
fellow
of
the
american
institute
of
anthropology
this
making
her
the
only
race
woman
in
the
united
states
to
graduate
from
this
institution
or
holding
such
a
degree
two
years
ago
minott
began
an
intensive
course
in
metaphysics
and
business
psychology
at
the
college
of
metaphysics
louis
mo
she
completed
the
courses
and
took
the
midwinter
examinations
recently
passing
with
honors
and
receiving
the
title
and
degree
of
doctor
of
metaphysics
being
the
first
again
of
the
race
to
receive
that
degree
in
this
country
the
first
years
of
minott
s
practice
were
confined
to
an
exclusive
clientele
among
the
whites
of
new
york
city
five
years
ago
however
she
was
prevailed
upon
to
establish
a
branch
of
the
clio
school
of
mental
sciences
in
chicago
and
to
centralize
her
efforts
somewhat
upon
the
developing
and
improving
of
her
own
people
this
she
did
and
her
efforts
have
met
with
enviable
success
and
gratifying
miss
minott
s
unusually
successful
career
proves
that
a
colored
girl
has
the
same
brain
power
to
reach
the
mental
heights
a
white
girl
is
able
to
attain
even
when
that
colored
girl
is
given
only
half
the
encouragement
half
the
privileges
and
half
access
to
the
proper
environments
it
is
true
that
all
colored
girls
can
not
soar
as
high
in
education
as
miss
minott
but
all
colored
girls
can
improve
themselves
from
day
to
day
if
they
will
only
decide
to
study
a
cook
can
elevate
herself
to
a
hairdresser
a
chambermaid
can
elevate
herself
to
a
dressmaker
a
waitress
can
elevate
herself
to
a
stenographer
and
typewriter
a
factory
girl
can
elevate
herself
to
a
bookkeeper
and
a
child
s
nurse
can
elevate
herself
to
a
school
teacher
but
such
girls
can
not
reach
such
successes
if
they
go
to
ball
rooms
and
cabarets
to
elevate
their
skirts
instead
of
going
to
night
schools
to
elevate
their
minds
it
all
depends
upon
each
girl
herself
whether
she
will
do
drudgery
work
all
her
life
or
whether
she
will
do
it
a
few
years
as
a
stepping
stone
while
she
is
preparing
herself
for
something
higher
colored
cooks
waitresses
who
think
it
is
no
use
to
develop
their
minds
or
study
for
more
education
just
because
they
are
colored
and
will
not
get
a
chance
to
use
such
education
should
remember
that
they
would
never
have
grape
fruits
oranges
or
bananas
to
prepare
and
serve
if
those
fruits
refused
to
grow
and
develop
because
of
their
yellow
skins
they
would
never
have
coffee
to
serve
if
it
had
refused
to
grow
because
it
is
brown
they
would
never
have
steak
to
broil
and
serve
if
yellow
alderney
or
black
holstein
cattle
had
refused
to
develop
from
calves
to
cows
because
of
their
colors
thus
if
fruits
vegetables
and
dumb
animals
keep
right
on
growing
and
developing
into
their
fullest
bloom
of
power
and
usefulness
regardless
of
their
colors
why
should
not
colored
girls
who
have
brains
to
think
hands
to
work
and
god
to
guide
them
in
right
do
the
same
in
medicine
the
medicine
man

fellow
who
makes
you
one
minute
cry
to
give
you
more
years
of

enough
money
to
set
himself
up
in

had
secured
his
freedom

moved

was

regarding
the
results

the

the

as

to

in

issue
of

by
wilton

edward
orval
gourdin
now
goes
down
in
the
harvard
annals
as
the
greatest
track
athlete
ever
to
represent
the
crimson
his
jump
of
feet
inches
in
the
running

last
saturday
at

international
college
meet
was
just
a
climax
to
his
amazing
achievements
on
the
cinders
amazing
record
but
that
particular
feat
alone
would
have
been
enough
to
rank
ned
with
the
elite
of
cambridge
because
the
world
has
been
waiting
twenty
years
for
a
man
capable
of
matching
peter
o
connor
s
leap
of
feet
inches
the
harvard
idol
accomplished
it
and
with
such
a
margin
that
it
now
seems
hopeless
of
developing
a
greater
jumper
for
a
number
of
years
anyway
his
prowess
on
the
track
would
have
been
sufficient
to
rate
him
with
the
best
had
he
chosen
to
specialize
in
any
one
of
the
eight
events
it
is
not
beyond
the
scope
of
human

see

it
convinced

of
two
truths
first
the
brotherhood
and
true
sportsmanship
feelings
between
white
and
colored
schools
in
america
are
slowly
but
surely
increasing
and
becoming
closer
and
more
friendly
secondly
negro
universities
colleges
and
schools
are
today
turning
out
athletes
who
can
hold
their
own
when
competing
with
athletes
developed
by
white
schools
of
the
same
class
colored
athletes
in
colored
universities
and

those
colored

in

but
a

of

colored

the
stamina
endurance
and
strength
of
their
muscles
bones

will
powers
against

the

cris
terriente
colored
champion
hitter
and
and
known
as
the
cuban
babe
ruth
was
a
marvel
even
several
years
ago
when
he
played
in
the
united
states
with
the
famous
colored
teams
american
giants
of
chicago
and
the
of
kansas
city
this
colored
ball
player
has
been
frequently
estimated
by
white
baseball
critics
as
being
an
equal
hitter
to
the
celebrated
babe
ruth
whose
services
were
sold
by
a
boston
team
to
a
new
york
team
for
over
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
and
one
of
those
white
critics
when
commenting
on
the
wonderful
baseball
playing
of
terriente
so
far
forgot
his
and
one
hundred
per
cent
americanism
as
to
allow
some
of
his
grayless
brain
matter
and
stagnant
watery
thoughts
to
soak
through
his
system
and
overflow
into
his
pen
point
that
splashed
little
puddles
of
poisoned
ink
in
his
article
he
lamented
the
fact
that
it
was
impossible
to
indelibly
terrente
so
as
to
make
him
white
enough
to
be
accepted
as
a
playing
member
on
one
of
the
big
league
white
baseball
teams
now
if
that
same
baseball
critic
had
entered
the
united
states
army
as
either
a
volunteer
or
a
draftee
in
the
world
war
and
had
been
dying
of
thirst
on
the
bloodsoaked
and
plains
of
no
man
s
land
it
is
wondered
if
he
would
have
thought
it
necessary
to
indelibly
colored
soldiers
before
accepting
from
their
black
lips
and
greedily
pressing
to
his
own
parched
white
lips
the
water
canteens
of
the
colored
soldiers
for
such
exchanges
of
canteens
between
generous
colored
and
dying
white
soldiers
occurred
thousands
of
times
and
in
not
one
instance
did
those
famished
white
men
allow
color
prejudice
to
stand
between
them
and
a
few
mouthsfuls
of
colored
water
that
meant
the
saving
of
their
lives
nevertheless
a
majority
of
those
soldiers
whose
lives
had
been
saved
by
the
timely
swallows
of
water
from
the
canteens
of
black
soldiers
immediately
resumed
their
persecution
of
and
discriminations
against
the
negro
race
even
before
they
got
back
home
to
america
thus
while
history
shows
that
the
majority
of
white
people
when
in
the
jaws
of
threatened
or
actual
death
become
too
and
to
see
the
hue
of
the
hand
or
the
shape
of
the
face
that
comes
to
its
help
and
vital
rescue
history
also
shows
that
a
great
many
white
people
while
in
the
pink
of
life
health
and
prosperity
allow
their
visions
to
become
so
magnified
and
their
minds
to
become
so
overrun
and
soaked
with
vile
race
prejudice
that
they
constantly
see
imaginary
that
really
do
not
exist
they
also
are
constantly
building
up
before
and
progressive
classes
of
colored
people
certain
racial
barriers
that
are
not
only
proving
a
stain
but
also
a
shame
in
the
eyes
of
the
rest
of
the
onlooking
world
upon
this
land
of
freedom
civilization
and
christianity
but
at
this
time
and
place
the
writer
will
not
go
further
into
this
particular
phase
of
this
subject
as
it
is
being
more
fully
dealt
with
in
the
writing
of
one
of
his
other
books
white
people
are
justly
ashamed
of
the
words
and
actions
of
such
members
of
their
race
as
the
above
mentioned
reporter
and
already
bright
rays
of
hope
are
beginning
to
shine
in
the
big

players

this
direction

from

about

a

negro
slave
by
the
name
of
tommy
molineaux
whipped
all
american
boxers
who
met
him
after
which
he
went
to

where
he
was
beaten
by
the
englishman
cribb
who
was
at
that
time
the
champion
of

britain
along
in
the
s
george
godfrey
was
in
his
prime
and
became
known
on
both
sides
of
the
ocean
on
account
of
whipping
the
famous
white
fighter
lannon
in
one
of
the
greatest
prize
fights
ever
pulled
off
in
new
england
godfrey
fought
rounds
with
the
great
fighter
jake
kilrain
and
he
also
staid
twenty
rounds
with
the
australian
black
wildcat
peter
jackson
as
john
sullivan
known
as
the
greatest
white
slugger
of
all
times
was
then
in
his
prime
and
zenith
godfrey
repeatedly
tried
to
meet
him
in
the
ring
but
sullivan
always
managed
to
evade
a
fight
with
him
peter
jackson
although
an
australian
by
birth
spent
his
best
fighting
years
in
america
he
fought
with
came
out
even
or
on
top
of
all
the
best
men
of
his
days
it
was
he
who
fought
a
round
draw
with
james
corbett
who
is
known
as
the
most
scientific
heavyweight
champion
boxer
the
world
has
ever
seen
jackson
was
considered
by
many
as
the
quickest
heavyweight
foot
worker
in
the
game
it
is
said
that
he
was
so
uncanny
quick
on
his
feet
that
many
times
when
an
opponent
made
a
lunge
at
him
jackson
would
dodge
the
blow
circle
to
the
rear
of
the
fighter
and
pin
him
one
back
of
the
ear
before
the
opponent
could
regain
his
balance
face
around
and
throw
up
his
guard
to
block
off
the
blow
during
all
the
time
he
was
meeting
the
best
heavyweights
jackson
held
out
a
standing
challenge
to
john
sullivan
who
never
would
meet
him
in
the
ring
but
john
was
always
truthful
enough
to
admit
that
he
did
not
consider
himself
champion
of
the
world
because
he
had
never
whipped
peter
jackson
for
proof
of
this
statement
write
to
the
editor
of
everybody
s
column
philadelphia
inquirer
according
to
an
article
that
appeared
in
the
philadelphia
evening
bulletin
of
january
and
which
was
written
by
hughey
fullerton
a
white
sport
critic
john
sullivan
also
side
stepped
another
colored
heavyweight
prize
fighter
who
was
known
in
louisiana
as
black
zeke
this
zeke
who
weighed
pounds
and
was
six
feet
two
inches
tall
could
lift
a
bale
of
cotton
weighing
five
hundred
pounds
in
reference
to
this
fighter
a
paragraph
in
the
above
mentioned
article
read
as
follows
after
the
fight
carrol
tried
to
arrange
a
bout
between
zeke
and
john
the
latter
refused
and
the
planter
followed
sullivan
over
the
country
but
to
no
so
while
sullivan
was
truthfully
champion
over
the
world
of
white
fighters
there
were
at
least
three
colored
fighters
george
godfrey
peter
jackson
and
black
zeke
over
whom
john
never
was
champion
because
he
had
never
whipped
any
one
of
them
although
all
three
had
repeatedly
followed
and
challenged
him
after
they
had
met
and
held
their
own
with
the
other
best
men
of
their
times
of
all
prize
fighters
colored
or
white
the
world
has
ever
known
george
dixon
was
declared
the
most
wonderful
of
them
all
being
a
little
over
four
feet
tall
weighing
less
then
pounds
with
small
tapering
legs
that
seemed
to
sweat
tears
of
pain
under
the
weight
of
his
gigantic
chest
and
unusually
broad
shoulders
from
which
dangled
muscular
arms
of
such
thickness
and
length
that
they
looked
unnatural
dixon
presented
a
most
uncanny
and
formidable
foe
when
stripped
in
the
ring
waiting
for
action
he
always
proved
just
as
formidable
as
he
looked
for
when
he
warmed
up
and
got
into
real
action
it
seemed
to
his
opponent
that
satan
and
their
entire
brood
of
little
satan
imps
from
hades
had
been
turned
loose
in
the
ring
during
a
period
of
ten
years
dixon
at
different
times
held
both
the
bantamweight
and
featherweight
championships
of
the
world
and
one
of
the
main
reasons
why
his
name
will
ever
go
down
in
ring
history
as
the
wonder
of
wonders
is
that
he
did
something
no
other
world
champion
has
ever
done
he
came
back
three
times
and
regained
his
lost
championship
it
is
said
that
he
made
a
record
of
over
a
thousand
clean
knockouts
during
his
fighting
career
his
three
come
backs
were
staged
as
follows
benny
jordan
took
the
title
from
him
and
he
regained
it
from
eddie
santry
frankie
erne
gave
dixon
a
good
spanking
one
year
and
the
next
year
he
thrashed
that
same
frankie
erne
sol
smith
gave
him
a
good
lacing
and
the
same
year
dixon
in
a
return
battle
took
back
his
title
and
in
doing
so
to
use
a
frequent
and
amusing
expression
of
one
tommy
howard
a
jolly
fellow
and
virginia
friend
of
the
writer
s
nearly
shook
the
living
life
out
of
because
dixon
always
went
into
the
to
give
his
best
in
manhood
fighting
and
not
his
worse
in
childhood
playing
and
faking
he
was
respected
and
beloved
by
fight
fans
of
all
classes
and
colors
which
was
proved
by
the
most
celebrated
sport
followers
of
the
day
including
champion
james
corbett
acting
as
pallbearers
at
his
funeral
joe
walcott
and
dixie
kid
were
two
other
great
little
fighters
and
they
both
became
welterweight
world
champions
walcott
from
to
and
dixie
kid
from
to
it
is
said
of
these
two
fighters
that
like
dixon
they
became
famous
in
their
readiness
to
meet
fighters
who
were
nearly
twice
their
height
and
weight
when
they
could
get
such
big
men
in
the
ring
with
them
they
usually
jumped
clear
off
the
floor
to
land
a
mighty
crushing
paw
upon
some
rival
s
tempting
jaw
that
then
and
there
felt
nothing
more
but
the
old
master
of
them
all
who
even
today
is
conceded
to
have
been
one
of
if
not
the
cleanest
hitting
quickest
moving
gamest
staying
and
most
scientific
boxers
colored
or
white
big
or
little
who
ever
waltzed
and
into
and
around
a
was
the
ring
s
national
favorite
joe
cans
of
baltimore
md
this
great
little
fighter
who
was
as
much
a
pet
of
the
white
sporting
faction
as
of
the
colored
element
took
the
lightweight
championship
away
from
frank
erne
in
and
kept
it
for
six
years
during
that
time
he
defeated
all
the
best
men
in
his
field
and
jumped
over
the
fence
into
the
welterweight
pastures
where
he
gored
and
tossed
into
the
air
several
human
beings
and
caused
many
to
climb
up
on
the
fence
in
order
to
keep
out
of
his
way
until
they
saw
that
his
constant
mad
rushes
had
weakened
his
stamina
and
tore
down
his
system
it
was
during
the
zenith
of
his
fighting
career
that
whenever
gans
started
from
home
to
engage
in
a
fight
his
mother
would
laughingly
say
bring
home
the
bacon
the
boy
fully
understood
and
appreciated
his
mother
s
encouraging
joke
and
never
returned
home
when
in
his
prime
without
bringing
along
the
winner
s
roll
of
money
joe
gans
was
as
game
as
any
game
rooster
that
ever
threw
defiant
crows
from
a
barnyard
gate
and
when
he
was
in
great
need
of
money
to
get
a
fight
he
would
make
such
vitality
sapping
and
strength
weakening
weights
that
people
wondered
how
he
was
able
to
stand
up
much
less
jump
around
and
fight
and
to
the
very
last
poor
but
not
broken
spirited
joe
gans
put
up
one
of
the
gamest
losing
battles
ever
fought
against
that
greatest
champion
of
all
times
among
all
peoples
death
panama
joe
gans
a
colored
fighter
of
today
has
added
laurels
to
the
name
he
has
adopted
by
becoming
middleweight
champion
like
his
late
namesake
he
is
willing
at
all
times
to
give
the
best
of
them
in
and
out
of
his
class
chances
to
win
his
title
just
because
he
is
a
champion
he
does
not
draw
the
color
line
against
any
white
fighter
but
fights
as
often
as
four
and
five
times
a
month
with
his
championship
at
stake
every
time
other
colored

who
were
among
the
best
in
their

who
no

would

won

on

along
with
the
american
public
disputed
jack

right
to
the
title
after
his
complete
whipping
of
jefferies
the
colored
fighter
proved
to
the
entire
world
that
he
was
not
only
the
rightful
holder
of
the
title
but
that
he
was
also
one
of
the
best
champions
the
ring
had
ever
seen
because
of
his
having
the
pantherlike
movements
and
quickness
of
a
peter

the
punch
of
a
john

the
scientific

balanced

first
good
step
that
johnson
has
taken
to
win
the
favor
of
the
real
sporting
public
the
present
public
will
not
stand
for
a
crook
or
a
bad
loser
it
killed
fred
fulton
a
very
likable
man
johnson
in
part
made
it
quite
plain
when
he
stated
if
he
was
going
to
lay
down
to
willard
he
would
have
done
so
in
the
seventh
or
ninth
round
and
not
wait
until
the
to
flop
he
also
stated
he
had
always
fought
square
and
that
was
the
reason
he
got
to
the
top
johnson
gives
a
good
reason
for
his
failure
to
whip
willard
a
very
good
reason
first
he
had
underestimated
willard
hadn
t
proper
training
ran
around
on
the
ocean
looking
for
a
battle
ground
these
had
their
effects
on
the
throughout
his
marvelous
fighting
career
johnson
was
climbing
to
success
under
most
unfavorable
conditions
white
fighters
in
winning
championships
have
only
to
fight
against
and
beat
down
the
opponent
in
the
ring
before
them
but
before
he
even
got
a
chance
to
fight
for
the
titled
belt
jack
had
always
to
mentally
fight
race
prejudice
on
the
outside
of
the
ring
at
the
same
time
he
was
physically
beating
down
his
white
opponent
in
the
ring
it
would
be
hard
to
find
proper
words
to
describe
the
great
fistic
career
johnson
would
have
made
for
himself
if
he
had
received
the
same
kind
of
unprejudiced
encouragements
and
boostings
all
white
champions
receive
and
if
up
to
this
date
nearly
one
hundred
million
of
white
americans
consider
it
wonderful
to
have
produced
out
of
that
number
seven
white
heavyweight
champion
fighters
sullivan
corbett
fitzsimmons
jefferies
burns
willard
and
dempsey
or
in
other
words
a
champion
for
ever
fourteen
million
of
their
population
then
it
must
be
most
wonderful
that
less
than
thirteen
million
of
colored
americans
under
most
unfair
and
persecuting
conditions
have
produced
one
heavyweight
champion
fighter
of
the
world
john
arthur
jack
johnson
for
the
benefit
of
those
people
who
on
account
of
their
jealousy
and
envy
of
johnson
s
fighting
ability
try
to
defame
and
lower
his
character
to
the
lowest
the
writer
would
suggest
the
reading
of
the
logic
article
jack
johnson
man
that
was
written
in
the
may
issue
of
the
chicago
defender
by
the
able
sport
scribe
juli
jones
jr
the
following
is
an
extract
from
that
article
both
races
got
jack
wrong
his
aim
in
life
was
not
to
be
a
doctor
preacher
lawyer
or
race
leader
he
set
out
to
be
the
best
man
with
his
fists
which
he
did
beyond
all
question
of
doubt
we
can
not
find
one
case
where
jack
ruined
any
young
girl
s
future
or
broke
up
any
man
s
happy
home
neither
was
he
mixed
up
in
any
barroom
fights
never
was
he
found
in
the
gutter
drunk
or
making
a
disgraceful
fellow
of
himself
throwing
away
his
money
on
the
other
hand
since
jack
has
been
from
his
country
press
reports
from
england
france
spain
and
mexico
tell
us
that
he
has
conducted
himself
in
the
most
gentlemanly
way
and
is
welcome
back
in
their
countries
at
any
time
how
many
men
who
have
been
born
under
any
flag
could
have
stood
what
jack
has
stood
for
the
past
six
or
eight
years
and
still
be
in
the
limelight
handing
the
world
a
golden
smile
saying
good
will
to
all
now
not
for
one
moment
is
the
writer
in
dealing
with
this
subject
attempting
to
shield
or
any
that
may
have
occured
in
the
private
life
of
jack
johnson
but
if
after
reading
the
above
quotation
there
still
be
those
people
who
continue
to
sneer
at
and
belittle
the
upward
struggles
and
crowning
success
of
this
professional
fighter
the
writer
would
kindly
suggest
that
each
one
of
such
people
ask
himself
or
herself
the
following
question
have
i
with
all
my
good

if
your

thus
far
have
colored
athletes
pushed
onward
but
the
following
are
a
few
mentioned
fields
of
athletics
in
which
colored
youths
have
not
become
very
active
or
efficient
mainly
because
of
the
lack
of
certain
facilities
and
sufficient
appliances
and
accommodations
for
proper
and
seasonable
trainings
rowing
crews
have
not
been
developed
in
any
of
the
colored
universities
colleges
and
schools
to
any
outside
recognized
extent
this
fact
is
quite
explainable
and
excusable
when
it
is
taken
into
consideration
that
few
of
these
institutions
are
located
near
natural
and
adequate
bodies
of
water
for
such
purposes
bordentown
school
bordentown
and
hampton
institute
hampton
are
perhaps
the
two
most
favorable
exceptions
in
this
case
both
of
these
schools
have
peaceful
streams
of
gurgling
waters
that
flow
so
near
as
to
softly
caress
the
oft
kissed
lips
of
their
lawns
calmly
setting
upon
the
banks
of
the
hampton

arm

has
running
before
its
very

half
mile

nearly
straight

unusually
smooth

is
wide

graceful
bend
from

to
downward
camden
there
are
already
hopeful
signs
appearing
which
show
that
both
of
these
institutions
in
the
near
future
will
take
full
advantages
of
their
natural
and
wonderful
water
facilities
by
developing
rowing
crews
that
some
day
will
be
second
to
none
in
the
country
by
the
time
this
stage
of
their
rowing
development
has
been
reached
it
is
hoped
that
the
racial
and
sportsmanship
feelings
between
white
and
colored
colleges
will
have
become
so
brotherly
and
peacefully
allied
that
the
rowing
crews
of
annapolis
will
be
friendly
competing
against
hampton
oarsmen
and
the
shellmen
of
princeton
will
be
friendly
churning
the
delaware
waters
against
the
crews
of
the
bordentown
school
and
when
such
times
do
come
about
the
writer
feels
sure
that
the
oarsmen
of
hampton
and
bordentown
will
guarantee
to
keep
enough
water
between
themselves
either
at
the
bow
or
stern
and
the
shells
of
annapolis
and
princeton
to
wash
away
and
keep

general
swimming
as
a
recreation
and
pastime
by
the
colored
people
in
the
united
states
has
in
the
past
been
sadly
neglected
for
some
excusable
and
some
unexcusable
reasons
the
chief
excusable
reasons
have
been
that
with
few
exceptions
they
have
not
had
access
to
the
places
where
they
could
indulge
in
this
sport
and
that
they
did
not
have
the
money
with
which
to
promote
and
construct
such
places
for
themselves
the
main
unexcusable
reason
has
been
that
they
with
but
few
exceptions
were
too
timid
and
scared
of
drowning
to
enter
water
deep
enough
and
stay
there
long
enough
to
learn
how
to
swim
for
instance
the
writer
several
years
ago
made
personal
investigations
among
many
colored
fishermen
oystermen
and
crabmen
who
live
along
the
shores
of
and
spend
the
biggest
part
of
their
lives
on
the
chesapeake
bay
in
little
boats
that
every
year
are
numerously
overturned
by
sudden
squalls
and
storms
and
to
his
great
and
painful
surprise
he
learned
from
those
men
themselves
that
the
majority
of
them
could
not
swim
a
stroke
while
among
those
who
had
learned
to
swim
but
few
had
confidence
enough
in
themselves
to
believe
they
could
even
swim
a
half
or
one
mile
and
yet
those
men
daily
risked
their
lives
and
ventured
out
upon
that
deep
and
uncertain
body
of
water
without
attempting
to
revive
and
develop
that
valuable
and
necessary
instinct
that
is
born
in
every
human
being
and
every
dumb
animal
as
the
result
of
such
thoughtless
neglect
of
their
own
personal
welfare
many
of
those
cheerful
honest
frugal
and
people
are
drowned
each
year
because
of
their
not
knowing
how
to
swim
but
today

swimming
instructors
are
using
every
persuasive
means
to
get
their
youths
interested

skilled
in
this
most
useful

refreshing
pastime
these

fully
realize

their
art
is
rightly
learned

it

brings
into

every
right

lines

if
a

should
at
any
time
just
before
entering
a
severe
critical
and
history
making
contest
suddenly
become
discouraged
and
because
of
his
race
and

he
should
remember
that

bert
williams
is

factor
when

humorous
moods

reinold
wolf
white
one
of
the
leading
stage
critics
of
today
wrote
of
bert
williams
as
being
the
greatest
comedian
on
the
american
years
back
this
noted
actor
was
a
partner
in
the
famous
abyssinia
williams
walker
company
for
several
years
he
has
been
a
star
actor
in
the
zeigfield
follies
a
leading
white
vaudeville
company
the
instant
that
williams
appears
before
the
footlights
whether
he
moves
stands
still
or
doesn
t
do
either
he
captures
his
audience
and
when
with
a
look
a
suggestive
motion
and
a
song
he
is
always
able
to
bring
down
a
most
dignified
house
in
uproarious
laughter
it
is
no
wonder
that
he
has
been
titled
the
harry
lauder
of
the
negro
race
for
years
the
columbia
phonograph
has
been
reproducing
williams
songs
on
their
records
that
are
in
great
demand
especially
his
songhit
parson
eatmore
aida
overton
walker
at
the
time
of
her
death
was
mentioned
by
some
of
the
new
york
papers
as
having
been
the
lillian
russell
of
the
negro
race
appearing
first
as
a
chorus
dancer
in
isham
s
octoroons
she
through
untiring
and
ceaseless
work
improved
her
acting
until
she
reached
her
highest
dancing
feature
in
the
interpretation
of
salome
which
acting
was
said
to
have
been
of
a
mary
garden
standard
in
their
primes
and
times
aida
and
her
talented
husband
george
walker
were
the
dancing
castles
of
that
period
and
no
couple
colored
or
white
before
or
since
have
been
able
to
excel
them
in
their
cake
walks
that
they
executed
by
invitation
before
most
of
the
kings
and
queens
in
europe
her
singing
of
why
adam
sinned
it
s
hard
to
love
somebody
when
somebody
don
t
love
you
and
if
you
ain
t
got
no
money
well
you
needn
t
come
around
had
not
been
equaled
by
any
singer
in
that
line
until
our
present
and
famous
mamie
smith
first
daintly
tripped
forth
and
with
those
hypnotizing
smiles
of
hers
caused
the
audience
to
quiver
and
tremble
from
the
crown
of
its
head
to
the
sole
of
its
feet
while
listening
to
her
singings
of
that
thing
called
love
you
can
t
keep
a
good
man
down
and
it
s
right
here
for
george
walker
the
partner
of
bert
williams
and
the
late
husband
of
aida
walker
was
the
real
bon

great
deal
of
his

glory
in

presentation
of

well
as

he
was

goers
were

shoo

katydid
and
i
must
have
been
a
before
going
any
further
mention
ought
to
be
made
of
the
ira
aldridge
who
was
born
in
bel
air
maryland
in
and
therefore
can
be
rightly
classed
as
an
american
product
although
he
spent
most
of
his
years
and
died
in
europe
even
today
he
is
considered
as
one
of
the
greatest
actors
the
negro
race
has
ever
had

europe

young
and
studying
at
glasgow
university
scotland
he
excelled
in

work
and
won
many
prizes
winning
one
success
after
another
he
finally
reached
his
zenith
in
the
playing
of
othello
the
moor
from
that
time
until
his
death
he
was
without
a
peer
in
portraying
that
character
and
few
have
equaled
him
since
his
acting
was
infused
with
so
much
intelligence
personality
naturalness
and
composure
that
he
was
always
assured
of
theatres
and
was
constantly
entertained
and
awarded
gold
medals
of
honor
by
the
crowned
rulers
of
england
prussia
austria

of
his
day
my

played
its

his

the

in

right
here
before
the

again
slips
from
the
writer
s
mind
must
be
mentioned
two
actors
the
late
tom
brown
and
ernest
hogan
on
account
of
their
seemingly
unlimited
theatrical
abilities
their
earnestness
in
performing
and
their
cheerful
and
lovable
dispositions
those
two
were
among
the
best
and
most
popular
actors
during
their
times
dudley
aside
from
having
shone
in
the
center
of
the
actor
s
spotlight
when
taking
active
parts
on
the
stage
has
become
one
of
america
s
leading
colored
theatrical
promoters

and
managers
in
the
country
he
is
owner
or
part
owner
of
theatres
in
washington
petersburg
and
other
cities
in
theatrical
circles
the
name
of
dudley
is
as
familiar
and
popular
among
colored
people
as
the
name
of
keith
is
among
white
people
the
king
pin
of
em
all
a
humorous
and
fitting
description
made
by
the
old
roll
top
desk
man
with
the
million
dollar
smile
is
charles
gilpin
the
dramatic
actor
who
was
given
the
highest
thespian
honors
of
the
season
on
broadway
never
in
the
history
of
the
stage
has
an
actor
been
accorded
the
class
of
press
notices
handed
gilpin
during
his
present
engagement
what
he
did
in
a
dramatic
way
in
abraham
lincoln
attracted
the
plaudits
of
the
critics
of
the
metropolitan
press
but
his
wonderful
work
in
the
emperor
jones
has
more
than
eclipsed
anything
seen
on
broadway
in
many
years
indeed
some
writers
claim
that
never
before
has
a
character
been
portrayed
in
as
graphic
a
manner
as
is
the
title
role
in
gilpin
s
present
the
above
is
an
extract
taken
from
an
article
that
appeared
in
the
march
issue
of
the
chicago
defender
and
which
article
was
written
by
tony
langston
dramatic
editor
and
advertising
manager
of
that
paper
to
the
thoughtless
observer
the
sudden
leap
to
fame
by
this
colored
actor
looked
like
a
streak
of
good
luck
but
not
so
years
ago
when
gilpin
was
working
as
a
coal
miner
butler
porter
and
many
other
menial
jobs
he
was
perhaps
unknown
to
even
himself
making
preparations
to
face
some
big
event
that
his
elevating
aspirations
pushed
him
on
to
meet
he
was
an
actor
then
but
he
had
not
found
himself
and
his
talents
were
undeveloped
when
he
organized
the
first
lafayette
dramatic
players
in
new
york
many
years
ago
he
was
beginning
to
find
and
unfold
himself
this
unfolding
continued
for
sometime
until
he
was
given
a
cast
in
john
drinkwater
s
abraham
then
what
gilpin
knew
for
years
but
did
not
get
a
chance
to
show
the
nation
learned
that
in
this
man
were
the
qualities
and
abilities
of
a
great
actor
so
when
the
big
opportunity
came
for
gilpin
to
play
the
principal
actor
in
eugene
o
neill
s
play
the
emperor
jones
this
colored
man
s
previous
years
of
hard
struggles
in
and
out
of
his
avenues
of
cherished
hopes
had
well
equipped
him
for
the
place
chance
may
have
put
him
there
but
luck
did
not
keep
him
there
only
long
preparations
and
the
proper
qualifications
that
are
allied
with
those
preparations
can
balance
and
keep
a
man
on
such
a
high
and
dizzy
steeple
point
as
that
and
also
enable
him
to
hold
a
spingarn
medal
some
of
the
other
colored
actors
and

in
america

walks
in

out

of
this
firm
as
the
highest
paid
writer
in

history
of

since
then
he
has
been
constantly
thumping
and
pounding
on
colored

boards
with
such
hard

with
ability

hopefulness
and
gratefulness
through
all
his
trials
upon
this
land
some
white
folks
take
the
negro
s
stand
and
this
has
kept
his
hopes
alive
for
higher
things
to
ever
strive
so
as
to
show
his
worth
and
thanks
to
those
who
share
their
brains
and
banks
from
the
year
when
negroes
were
first
brought
from
africa
to
the
american
colonies
colored
people
had
from
the
very
first
a
few
of
the
truest
kind
of
friends
among
a
certain
class
of
clean
hearted
and
christian
white
people
this
group
of
people
never
was
in
favor
of
slavery
but
they
could
not
stop
it
because
their
numbers
were
so
much
smaller
than
those
who
wanted
and
did
have
slaves
but
white
friends
of
those
shackled
human
beings
rapidly
increased
in
numbers
until
when
they
felt
that
at
last
they
were
not
only
evenly
matched
but
also
had
the
sentiment
of
the
rest
of
the
world
with
them
against
the
southern
white
enemies
of
the
negro
in
freedom
even
during
the
darkest
days
of
slavery
there
were
white
men
and
women
in
both
the
north
and
south
who
after
having
slaves
given
to
them
by
their
parents
became
so
heavy
of
heart
and
worried
in
mind
because
of
their
parts
in
such
soul
damming
sins
and
crimes
that
they
would
not
longer
keep
their
colored
people
as
slaves
but
set
them
free
then
again
on
account
of
some
valuable
deeds
or
services
they
had
performed
many
slaves
were
made
free
outright
or
were
allowed
to
work
their
freedom
out
on
easy
terms
some
owners
while
they
were
not
quite
christianized
or
civilized
enough
to
free
their
slaves
were
in
several
ways
quite
kind
to
them
and
sometimes
secretly
for
the
laws
of
the
land
forbid
owners
educating
their
slaves
taught
them
to
read
and
write
in
somewhat
the
same
amusing
and
pitying
manner
that
boys
and
girls
of
today
are
kind
to
their
pet
birds
and
rabbits
and
teach
them
several
smart
tricks
but
yet
will
not
open
the
cage
doors
and
turn
them
loose
thus
in
the
above
ways
there
were
during
the
whole
period
of
slavery
in
the
colonies
a
certain
number
of
negroes
who
had
secured
their
freedom
as
well
as
good
educations
in
many
instances
this
explains
how
it
is
possible
for
the
writer
to
truthfully
mention
within
these
pages
historical
facts
relative
to
certain
colored
people
becoming
noted
teachers
preachers
doctors
newspaper
editors
long
before
the
civil
war
and
the
freedom
of
all
negroes
in
america
through
the
agencies
of
such
organizations
and
societies
as
named
below
thousands
of
northern
white
people
either
by
means
of
their
money
or
through
actual
service
among
the
colored
people
in
the
south
showed
their
unquestioned
friendships

either

stands

justice
to

three
southern
governors
have
fearlessly
taken
within
the
past
two
years
in
july
governor
thos
bickett
of
north
carolina
sent
the
state
militia
under
capt
fowler
to
graham
with
orders
to
halt
and
prevent
a
white
mob
from
breaking
into
jail
and
lynching
three
negro
prisoners
after
the
troops
had
arrived
and
were
placed
on
guard
the
mob
advanced
on
the
jail
to
secure
the
prisoners
but
were
halted
and
scattered
by
the
militia
s
machine
gun
that
killed
one
and
wounded
three
of
the
lynchers
during
march
governor
edwin
morrow
of
kentucky
removed
from
office
the
white
jailer
edgar
for
allowing
a
white
mob
to
enter
the
jail
and
lynch
richard
james
a
colored
prisoner
this
governor
also
offered
a
reward
of
one
thousand
five
hundred
dollars
for
the
capture
and
conviction
of
each
member
of
the
mob
right
on
the
heels
of
the
exposure
and
arrest
of
the
georgia
white
planter
williams
who
was
convicted
in
april
for
the
murder
of
lindsey
peterson
a
colored
laborer
on
williams
peonage
plantation
where
the
murdered
bodies
of
at
least
ten
other
colored
laborers
were
found
governor
hugh
dorsey
of
georgia
had
published
and
freely
circulated
a
pamphlet
entitled
the
negro
in
in
this
publication
the
governor
bravely
and
in
detail
tells
of
incidents
of
cruelties
committed
upon
georgia
negroes
in
only
two
of
these
cases
were
the
victims
accused
of
crimes
against
white
women
the
remaining
exposures
tell
of
the
whippings
shootings
lynchings
and
the
enslavement
of
colored
laborers
under
the
forced
labor
systems
as
well
as
the
driving
away
of
wealthy
colored
people
from
their
homes
by
bodily
abuses
or
threatened
tortures
when
it
is
taken
into
consideration
that
those
officials
fully
knew
that
their
stands
against
and
exposures
of
such
savage
behaviors
of
their
own
people
would
without
doubt
mean
their
political
deaths
as
well
as
making
for
themselves
state
wide
enemies
who
would
not
hesitate
to
do
them
physical
harm
the
acts
of
those
governors
were
really
those
of
heroes
in
performing
their
full
official
and
christian
duties
they
have
already
influenced
many
other
southern
officials
to
come
forward
like
real
men
and
help
to
wash
away
from
the
south
especially
georgia
its
stain
and
shame
during
the
past
twenty
years
hon
joseph
manning
of
alabama
because
of
his
continued
courageous
stands
and
his
mighty
platform
and
pen
fights
for
justice
to
the
colored
people
especially
in
the
south
has
constantly
proved
himself
one
of
the
most
fearless
and
truest
white
friends
the

today
in
the

issue
of

there
was
republished
the
article
let
him
have
due
credit
that
appeared
in
the
april
issue
of
the
washington
bee
the
article
in
part
says
the
peonage
conditions
in
georgia
and
the
trail
that
has
been
going
on
down
there
recalls
that
it
was
hon
joseph
manning
of
alabama
who
first
brought
peonage
conditions
in
alabama
and
the
south
to
national
attention
and
into
national
discussion
a
letter
written
by
manning
to
the
new
york
evening
post
in
not
only
assailed
this
condition
but
named
the
peonage
perpetrators
the
literary
digest
made
a
review
of
the
newspaper
comment
the
article
aroused
the
papers
in
alabama
some
of
them
vilified
manning
unmercifully
he
was
denounced
as
a
defamer
of
his
state
branded
as
a
liar
the
peonage
conditions
were
denied
but
in
not
a
great
while
the
citizens
he
named
were
prosecuted
and
convicted
through
the
operations
of
the
department
of
justice
when
moody
was
attorney
general
in
the
matter
of
peonage
as
well
as
in
the
showing
up
of
black
belt
frauds
in
the
south
it
was
none
other
than
hon
joseph
manning
who
took
the
initiative
and
has
stood
the
burden
to
follow
for
having
stood
for
right
precisely
as
he
fought
black
belt
frauds
helping
to
unseat
southern
members
of
congress
in
he
has
kept
on
fighting
disfranchisement
and
arraigned
lynching
and
all
sorts
of
mobs
and
mob
government
president
harding
when
in
the
united
states
senate
was
called
on
frequently
by
manning
who
discussed
these
wrongs
with
the
man
who
was
to
become
president
the
bee
then
followed
the
work
being
done
in
right
here
in
washington
by
manning
no
man
more
than
the
president
of
the
united
states
knows
about
this
labor
of
manning
for
right
and
for
illustration

sensibly
educated
and
white
lady
harriet

stowe
made
for
herself
everlasting
fame
immortalized
her
name
and
at
the
same
time
reaped
an
independent
fortune
just
by
sowing
seeds
of
consideration
and
kindness
among
looking
upon
and
treating
as
god
s
human
beings
and
american
citizens
the
colored
people
in
the
united
states
as
the
above
were
the
earthly
rewards

hearts
of
weak
and
sinful
mankind
were
softened
and
melted
enough
to
give
to
stowe
just
think
of
the
indescribable
rewards

always
loving
heart
of
