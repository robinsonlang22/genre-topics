dedicate
this
book
introduction
fair
leyden
i
am
glad
that
mrs
seaman
has
written
this
story
americans
can
not
know
leyden
too
well
for
no
city
in
europe
so
worthily
deserves
the
name
of
alma
mater
here
after
giving
the
world
an
inspiring
example
of
heroism
modern
liberty
had
her
chosen
home
the
siege
so
finely
pictured
in
this
story
took
place
about
midway
in
time
between
two
great
events
the
march
of
alva
the
spaniard
and
his
terrible
army
of
black
beards
into
the
netherlands
and
the
union
of
utrecht
by
which
the
seven
states
formed
the
dutch
republic
this
new
nation
was
based
on
the
federal
compact
of
a
written
constitution
under
the
red
and
white
striped
flag
in
which
each
stripe
represented
a
state
under
that
flag
which
we
borrowed
in
and
still
keep
though
we
have
added
stars
universal
common
school
education
of
all
the
children
in
public
schools
sustained
by
taxation
and
freedom
of
religion
for
all
was
the
rule
leyden
won
her
victory
seven
years
before
the
dutch
declaration
of
independence
in
july
as
our
own
benjamin
franklin
declared
in
love
of
liberty
and
bravery
in
the
defense
of
it
she
the
dutch
republic
has
been
our
great
example
with
freedom
won
as
so
graphically
portrayed
in
this
story
leyden
enlarged
her
bounds
and
welcomed
to
residence
and
citizenship
three
companies
of
people
who
became
pioneers
of
our
american
life
like
the
they
brought
something
with
them
to
our
nation
they
gave
some
of
the
noblest
principles
of
the
seven
dutch
united
states
to
help
in
making
those
thirteen
of
july
and
the
constitutional
commonwealth
of
formed
by
the
people
of
the
united
states
of
america
first
of
all
to
victorious
leyden
came
the
walloons
or
refugees
from
belgium
to
gather
strength
before
sailing
in
the
good
ship
new
netherland
in
to
lay
the
foundations
of
the
empire
state
then
followed
the
pilgrim
fathers
of
new
england
many
of
the
young
and
strong
who
sailed
in
the
speedwell
and
mayflower
were
born
in
leyden
and
spoke
and
wrote
dutch
the
old
folks
who
could
not
cross
the
atlantic
remained
in
leyden
until
they
died
and
some
were
buried
in
pancras
and
peter
church
in
this
city
also
dwelt
the
huguenots
in
large
numbers
many
of
whom
came
to
america
to
add
their
gifts
and
graces
to
enrich
our
nation
last
but
not
least
besides
educating
in
her
university
hundreds
of
colonial
americans
including
two
sons
of
john
adams
one
of
whom
john
quincy
adams
became
president
of
the
united
states
leyden
in
led
in
the
movement
to
recognize
us
as
an
independent
country
then
the
dutch
lent
us
four
millions
of
dollars
which
paid
off
our
starving
continentals
principal
and
interest
repaid
in
amounting
to
fourteen
millions
were
used
to
develop
six
thousand
square
miles
of
western
new
york
when
new
amsterdam
later
called
buffalo
was
laid
out
and
whence
came
two
of
our
presidents
fillmore
and
cleveland
a
most
delightful
romance
is
this
of
mrs
seaman
true
to
facts
and
exact
in
coloring
it
is
all
the
better
for
being
the
straightforward
narrative
of
a
real
boy
and
a
genuine
girl
gysbert
cooking
pot
once
smoking
with
savory
spanish
stew
or
is
still
to
be
seen
in
the
stedelyk
city
museum
which
every
american
ought
to
visit
when
in
leyden
it
is
in
the
old
laken
hal
or
cloth
hall
from
the
turreted
battlements
of
hengist
hill
den
burg
we
may
still
look
out
over
the
country
if
in
leyden
on
october
one
will
see
thanksgiving
day
celebrated
as
i
know
it
was
most
gaily
in
in
a
most
delightfully
dutch
way
when
the
brides
of
the
year
are
in
evidence
in
belfry
lane
where
jacqueline
lived
was
the
later
home
of
the
pilgrim

on
the
wall
of
great
saint
peter

is
a
bronze
tablet
in
honor
of
the

inside

of
jean
luzac
friend
of
washington
jefferson
and
adams
his
newspaper
printed
in
dutch
and
french
during
our
revolutionary
war
won
for
us
the
recognition
of
three
governments
in
europe
on
the
rapenburg
where
he
lived
a
bronze
tablet
in
his
honor
was
unveiled
to
the
singing
of
the
star
spangled
banner
on
september
having
spent
weeks
in
leyden
during
a
dozen
visits
i
can
testify
to
the
general
historic
accuracy
as
well
as
to
the
throbbing
human
interest
of
this
story
of
of

chapter
i
on
hengist
hill
the
hush
of
a
golden
may
afternoon
lay
on
the
peaceful
watery
streets
of
leyden
just
enough
breeze
circulated
to
rustle
the
leaves
of
the
poplars
limes
and
willows
that
arched
the
shaded
canals
the
city
drowsed
in
its
afternoon
siesta
and
few
were
about
to
notice
the
boy
and
girl
making
their
way
rapidly
toward
the
middle
of
the
town
directly
before
them
the
streets
and
stone
bridges
gave
place
to
a
steep
incline
of
ground
rising
to
a
considerable
height
its
sides
were
clothed
with
groves
of
fruit
trees
and
from
its
summit
frowned
the
mouldering
walls
of
some
fortress
so
old
and
deserted
was
this
tower
that
a
great
clump
of
oak
trees
had
grown
up
inside
of
it
and
overtopped
its
walls
art
thou
tired
gysbert
asked
the
girl
a
slim
lass
of
seventeen
of
her
younger
brother
a
boy
of
little
over
fourteen
years
no
jacqueline
i
am
strong
a
burden
of
this
sort
does
not
weary
me
answered
the
boy
and
he
stoutly
took
a
fresh
grip
on
some
large
object
wrapped
in
a
dark
shawl
that
they
carried
between
them
up
the
steep
sides
of
the
hill
they
toiled
now
lost
to
sight
in
the
grove
of
fruit
trees
now
emerging
again
near
the
grim
walls
of
the
old
battlement
panting
for
breath
yet
laughing
gaily
they
placed
the
burden
on
the
ground
and
sat
down
beside
it
to
rest
and
look
about
them
before
their
eyes
lay
pictured
the
sparkling
of
the
city
beyond
whose
limits
stretched
the
fair
fertile
plains
of
holland
and
in
the
dim
distance
the
blue
line
of
the
boundless
ocean
eyes
grew
misty
with
longing
ah
if
i
had
but
brush
and
colors
i
would
paint
this
he
sighed
i
would
paint
it
so
that
all
the
world
would
think
they
looked
upon
the
very
scene
itself
some
day
thou
shalt
have
them
gysbert
if
thou
dost
but
possess
thyself
with
patience
answered
his
sister
with
the
gentle
yet
authoritative
air
of
her
three
years
senority
we
will
raise
many
pigeons
and
train
them
then
when
the
price
we
have
obtained
from
them
is
sufficient
thou
shalt
buy
an
artist
outfit
and
paint
to
thy
heart
content
meantime
thou
must
practice
with
thy
charcoal
and
pencil
and
wait
till
the
war
is
over
both
sat
silent
for
a
while
each
occupied
with
thoughts
that
were
in
all
probability
very
similar
the
little
word
war
recalled
to
them
memories
pictures
speculations
and
fears
all
very
painful
and
puzzling
neither
one
could
remember
the
time
when
their
land
of
the
netherlands
had
been
allowed
to
pursue
its
avocations
unmolested
by
the
terrible
spanish
soldiery
from
time
immemorial
had
these
fair
provinces
been
tightly
grasped
in
the
clutch
of
spain
now
at
last
they
were
awakening
rousing
themselves
from
the
long
inaction
and
striking
the
first
bold
blows
for
liberty
from
the
relentless
oppressor
little
did
the
children
dream
as
they
sat
looking
out
over
the
beautiful
city
that
this
same
year
of
and
this
same
leyden
were
to
witness
the
great
of
the
struggle
look
look
jacqueline
there
is
the
church
of
saint
pancras
and
there
is
our
house
in
belfry
lane
i
can
almost
see
vrouw
voorhaas
looking
from
the
window
come
let
us
set
free
the
pigeons
and
gysbert
all
excitement
began
to
fumble
with
the
wrappings
of
the
bundle
jacqueline
rose
threw
back
the
two
golden
braids
that
had
fallen
across
her
shoulders
and
knelt
down
to
superintend
the
work
very
carefully
they
removed
the
dark
shawl
and
laid
it
aside
disclosing
a
box
roughly
fashioned
like
a
cage
containing
four
pigeons
the
frightened
birds
fluttered
about
wildly
for
a
moment
then
settled
down
cooing
softly
when
they
had
become
accustomed
to
the
daylight
jacqueline
opened
one
side
of
the
box
thrust
in
her
arm
and
drew
toward
her
a
young
pigeon
of
magnificent
coloring
whose
iridescent
neck
glittered
as
if
hung
with
jewels
the
girl
cuddled
the
bird
gently
under
her
chin
and
with
one
finger
stroked
his
handsome
head
let
us
send
of
orange
first
she
said
he
is
the
finest
strongest
and
wisest
and
will
lead
the
way
i
am
glad
we
named
him
after
our
great
leader
but
the
message
gysbert
reminded
her
we
must
not
forget
that
or
good
vrouw
voorhaas
will
never
know
whether
he
got
back
first
or
not
she
can
not
seem
to
remember
one
pigeon
from
another
here
i
will
write
it
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
tiny
scrap
of
paper
on
which
he
hastily
scrawled
of
orange
brings
greetings
to
vrouw
voorhaas
from
jacqueline
and
gysbert
this
he
wrapped
about
the
leg
of
the
bird
and
tied
it
with
a
string
now
let
him
go
he
cried
jacqueline
stood
up
lifted
the
bird
in
both
hands
and
with
a
swift
upward
movement
launched
him
into
the
air
the
pigeon
circled
round
and
round
for
a
moment
then
mounted
up
into
the
sky
with
a
curious
spiral
flight
when
it
was
many
feet
above
the
children
it
suddenly
changed
its
tactics
spread
its
wings
taut
and
made
straight
in
the
direction
of
saint
pancras
spire
and
belfry
lane
bravo
bravo
they
cried
watching
intently
till
its
wings
had
all
but
faded
from
sight
of
orange
is
a
true
carrier
pigeon
now
for
the
rest
one
after
another
they
released
the
three
remaining
birds
to
whom
they
had
given
the
names
louis
and
john
after
the
great
william
of
nassau
two
favorite
brothers
and
lastly
boisot
it
seemed
to
be
a
fancy
of
the
children
to
call
their
pets
after
their
famous
generals
and
naval
commanders
these
are
the
finest
pigeons
we
have
raised
remarked
jacqueline
as
she
shaded
her
eyes
to
watch
their
flight
none
of
the
others
can
compare
with
them
though
all
are
good
now
we
have
twenty
added
gysbert
and
all
have
proved
that
they
have
the
very
best
training
no
pigeons
in
the
city
are
like
ours
not
even
old
jan
van
buskirk
when
shall
we
begin
to
hire
them
out
as
messengers
jacqueline
perhaps
there
will
be
an
opportunity
soon
answered
the
girl
now
that
our
city
is
no
longer
besieged
we
may
have
to
bide
our
time
but
no
one
can
tell
what
will
happen
next
in
these
days
we
must
wait
gysbert
come
come
let
us
be
going
said
her
brother
restlessly
and
see
if
they
all
get
back
safely
and
whether
of
orange
was
first
no
let
us
stay
awhile
replied
jacqueline
it
is
pleasant
and
cool
up
here
and
the
afternoon
is
long
vrouw
voorhaas
will
let
the
birds
in
and
tell
us
all
about
when
they
arrived
we
may
as
well
enjoy
the
day
she
reseated
herself
and
gazed
off
toward
the
blue
line
of
the
ocean
shut
out
from
the
land
by
a
series
of
dykes
whose
erection
represented
years
of
almost
incredible
labor
the
river
rhine
making
its
way
sluggishly
to
the
sea
a
very
different
rhine
from
that
of
its
earlier
course
through
germany
was
almost
choked
off
by
the
huge
sand
dunes
through
which
it
forced
its
discouraged
path
the
girl
thoughtful
mood
was
infectious
and
gysbert
after
rambling
about
idly
for
a
time
came
and
settled
himself
at
her
side
is
a
strange
hill
this
is
it
not
jacqueline
to
be
rising
right
in
the
middle
of
a
city
like
leyden
why
there
is
nothing
like
it
for
miles
upon
miles
in
this
flat
country
how
came
it
here
i
wonder
father
used
to
tell
me
said
the
girl
that
some
think
it
was
the
work
of
the
romans
when
they
occupied
the
land
many
centuries
ago
while
more
declare
that
it
was
raised
by
the
conqueror
hengist
that
is
why
it
is
called
hill
how
different
it
would
have
been
for
us
if
father
had
lived
exclaimed
gysbert
suddenly
changing
the
subject
it
seems
so
long
ago
and
i
was
so
young
that
i
do
not
remember
much
about
him
tell
me
what
thou
knowest
jacqueline
thou
art
older
and
must
remember
him
better
yes
i
was
eleven
said
jacqueline
with
a
dreamy
look
in
her
eyes
and
thou
wast
only
eight
when
he
went
away
and
we
never
saw
him
again
we
had
always
lived
in
the
city
of
louvain
and
father
was
a
professor
of
medicine
in
the
big
university
there
mother
died
when
thou
wast
but
a
little
baby
i
can
just
remember
her
as
tall
and
pale
and
and
very
gentle
good
vrouw
voorhaas
always
kept
house
for
us
and
we
had
a
big
house
then
a
grand
house
and
many
servants
father
was
so
loving
and
so
kind
he
used
to
take
me
on
his
knee
and
tell
me
many
tales
of
holland
and
the
former
days
i
liked
best
those
about
the
beautiful
countess
jacqueline
of
bavaria
after
whom
he
said
i
was
named
and
of
how
good
and
beloved
she
was
and
how
much
she
suffered
for
her
people
then
came
the
day
when
he
disappeared
no
one
knew
how
or
where
for
a
while
till
the
news
reached
vrouw
voorhaas
that
he
had
been
captured
by
the
cruel
duke
of
alva
and
put
to
death
it
was
at
the
same
time
that
the
young
count
de
buren
the
eldest
son
of
our
great
william
of
orange
was
kidnapped
from
the
university
where
he
was
studying
and
taken
a
captive
to
spain
we
had
little
time
to
think
of
that
outrage
so
great
was
our
grief
for
our
dear
father
vrouw
voorhaas
dismissed
all
the
servants
closed
the
house
and
sold
it
and
we
came
to
leyden
to
live
in
the
little
house
in
belfry
lane
where
we
have
been
ever
since
the
boy
listened
spellbound
though
the
recital
was
evidently
one
that
had
been
but
had
never
lost
its
mystery
and
sorrowful
charm
i
was
so
little
he
said
at
last
i
only
remember
our
father
as
a
tall
man
with
gray
hair
and
beard
and
very
blue
twinkling
eyes
it
is
all
like
a
dream
to
me
but
is
it
not
singular
jacqueline
that
vrouw
voorhaas
will
never
talk
about
him
to
us
nor
answer
any
questions
when
we
ask
about
him
and
she
has
told
us
never
to
mention
his
name
to
others
and
has
made
us
change
our
last
name
from
cornellisen
to
coovenden
i
wonder
why
it
is
very
strange
agreed
jacqueline
shaking
her
head
and
i
do
not
understand
it
myself
she
told
me
once
that
i
should
know
some
day
and
till
then
must
never
question
her
but
the
restless
spirit
had
again
seized
gysbert
and
he
scrambled
to
his
feet
to
make
another
tour
around
the
old
fortress
suddenly
the
girl
was
startled
by
his
loud
insistent
shout
jacqueline
jacqueline
come
here
there
is
something
very
odd
coming
across
the
plains
come
quickly
she
rose
and
ran
to
the
other
side
of
the
hill
where
she
found
gysbert
shading
his
eyes
with
one
hand
with
the
other
he
pointed
to
a
thin
dark
undulating
line
moving
slowly
in
the
direction
of
the
city
while
here
and
there
the
sun
caught
a
flash
of
blue
and
white
as
from
waving
banners
jacqueline
cheeks
grew
white
the
spaniards
she
breathed
the
spaniards
indeed
shouted
gysbert
and
coming
to
besiege
the
city
once
more
when
we
thought
they
had
left
us
for
good
and
all
in
five
hours
at
most
they
will
be
here
in
front
of
the
walls
we
must
run
to
warn
the
burgomaster
van
der
werf
to
strengthen
the
defences
and
make
all
speed
to
close
the
gates
there
is
not
a
moment
to
lose
come
and
without
another
thought
but
for
the
safety
of
the
beautiful
city
the
two
children
clasped
hands
and
ran
at
top
speed
down
the
steep
hillside
in
the
direction
of
the
great
statehouse
the
king
pardon
chapter
ii
this
king
pardon
a
week
had
passed
and
leyden
lay
encircled
by
the
spanish
army
in
a
state
of
close
siege
eight
thousand
troops
under
the
spanish
commander
valdez
surrounded
the
city
redoubts
had
been
raised
to
bombard
its
walls
and
moreover
the
number
of
the
enemy
was
daily
increasing
but
the
town
were
only
a
small
corps
of
burgher
guards
and
freebooters
under
the
command
of
brave
john
van
der
does
three
sources
alone
supplied
the
reliance
of
the
beleaguered
city
their
trust
in
god
the
stout
hearts
and
willing
hands
of
the
inhabitants
and
the
sleepless
energy
of
prince
william
of
orange
their
heroic
national
commander
jacqueline
stood
in
the
one
morning
about
eight
days
after
the
trip
to
hengist
hill
feeding
her
little
troop
of
carrier
pigeons
her
golden
hair
fell
over
her
shoulders
in
two
shining
braids
her
eyes
sparkled
and
her
cheeks
glowed
with
the
pleasure
of
her
occupation
upon
her
shoulders
her
hands
and
even
her
head
perched
the
feathered
pets
so
tame
that
they
fairly
disputed
among
themselves
for
the
privilege
of
her
attention
the
was
a
room
on
the
top
floor
of
the
little
house
in
belfry
lane
the
sun
streamed
in
brightly
through
the
large
open
window
the
walls
were
lined
with
boxes
serving
as
nests
and
every
detail
of
the
room
was
through
the
untiring
efforts
of
jacqueline
as
neat
and
immaculate
as
a
new
pin
suddenly
the
door
opened
and
gysbert
hatless
and
panting
stood
on
the
threshold
ah
jacqueline
he
exclaimed
with
true
artist
instinct
what
a
beautiful
picture
thou
dost
make
standing
there
in
the
sunlight
with
the
pigeons
all
around
thee
had
i
but
time
i
would
bring
my
pencil
and
sketch
thee
just
as
thou
art
but
hurry
hurry
the
burgomaster
van
der
werf
is
going
to
make
a
speech
and
read
two
proclamations
from
the
steps
of
the
statehouse
every
one
will
be
there
come
we
must
get
near
the
front
yes
yes
echoed
jacqueline
as
eager
as
the
boy
close
thou
the
door
tightly
gysbert
and
we
will
hurry
that
we
may
not
miss
a
word
ah
i
hope
that
the
good
william
the
silent
has
sent
the
city
a
message
out
into
the
street
they
sallied
mingling
with
the
crowd
that
was
surging
toward
the
open
square
in
front
of
the
great
statehouse
the
bells
of
saint
pancras
sounded
the
signal
for
a
public
meeting
and
one
could
read
from
each
earnest
excited
countenance
the
importance
that
was
placed
on
being
present
in
this
crisis
look
cried
gysbert
there
is
jan
van
buskirk
not
far
ahead
i
thought
he
was
too
ill
with
lumbago
to
leave
his
bed
see
how
he
hobbles
along
let
us
join
him
jacqueline
they
ran
ahead
and
caught
up
with
the
old
man
who
greeted
them
cheerily
in
spite
of
the
pains
with
which
his
poor
bent
body
was
racked
yes
i
managed
to
crawl
out
of
my
bed
he
assured
them
is
important
that
every
one
should
attend
these
meetings
in
such
a
pass
as
we
are
now
think
you
we
will
hear
word
from
william
the
silent
aye
but
i
hope
so
though
i
do
not
yet
know
certainly
answered
the
boy
we
have
received
no
word
from
him
since
the
siege
began
surely
he
will
not
desert
us
in
this
hour
of
need
see
gysbert
whispered
jacqueline
there
is
that
dirk
willumhoog
across
the
street
do
not
let
us
get
near
him
his
very
appearance
makes
me
shudder
the
girl
shrank
closer
to
her
brother
and
old
surely
thou
art
not
afraid
of
him
jacqueline
said
gysbert
scornfully
is
true
i
detest
him
myself
but
i
fear
him
not
what
harm
can
he
do
us
i
do
not
know
replied
his
sister
but
there
is
that
in
his
look
that
makes
me
think
he
would
harm
us
if
he
could
poof
exclaimed
gysbert
did
i
not
tell
thee
that
he
stopped
me
in
the
street
one
day
and
asked
me
who
we
were
and
where
we
lived
and
who
took
care
of
us
i
reminded
him
that
it
was
naught
of
his
affairs
as
far
as
i
could
see
and
left
him
to
scowl
his
ugly
scowl
as
i
walked
away
whistling
but
the
crowd
had
swept
dirk
willumhoog
from
their
sight
and
in
a
few
moments
they
found
themselves
in
the
great
square
surging
with
people
and
as
fortune
would
have
it
almost
directly
in
front
of
the
imposing
statehouse
from
whose
high
carved
steps
the
proclamations
were
to
be
read
they
were
not
a
moment
too
soon
and
had
but
just
pushed
their
way
to
the
front
near
a
convenient
wall
against
which
jan
might
lean
when
adrian
van
der
werf
the
dignified
and
honored
burgomaster
of
the
city
appeared
on
the
stone
steps
high
above
the
crowd
the
universal
babel
of
tongues
immediately
ceased
and
the
hush
that
followed
was
broken
only
by
the
occasional
booming
of
the
spanish
guns
battering
at
the
walls
of
the
city
then
the
burgomaster
began
to
speak
men
and
women
of
leyden
i
am
here
to
read
to
you
two
proclamations
one
from
our
beloved
william
the
silent
prince
of
here
he
was
interrupted
by
loud
and
prolonged
cheers
from
the
multitude
and
one
from
his
majesty
king
philip
the
second
of
spain
the
absolute
and
scornful
silence
with
which
the
people
received
the
last
name
was
but
a
fitting
indication
of
their
hatred
i
shall
read
the
message
from
the
prince
of
orange
first
and
while
the
people
listened
in
eager
respectful
silence
he
repeated
to
them
how
their
prince
and
leader
whose
headquarters
were
now
at
delft
and
rotterdam
sympathized
with
them
sincerely
in
their
fresh
trouble
and
how
he
deplored
the
fact
that
they
had
not
followed
his
suggestion
to
lay
in
large
stocks
of
provisions
and
fortify
their
city
while
there
had
been
time
in
the
months
before
the
siege
the
prince
reminded
them
that
they
were
now
about
to
contend
not
for
themselves
alone
but
for
all
future
generations
of
their
beloved
land
the
eyes
of
the
world
were
upon
them
they
would
reap
eternal
glory
if
they
exhibited
a
courage
worthy
of
the
cause
of
their
liberty
and
religion
he
implored
them
to
hold
out
for
three
months
in
which
time
he
would
surely
devise
means
for
their
deliverance
he
warned
them
to
take
no
heed
of
fair
promises
from
the
spaniards
if
they
would
surrender
the
city
reminding
them
of
how
these
same
soldiers
had
behaved
at
the
sieges
of
naarden
and
haarlem
when
in
spite
of
their
declaration
to
let
the
citizens
go
out
in
peace
they
had
rushed
in
and
murdered
every
one
as
soon
as
the
gates
were
opened
finally
he
begged
them
to
take
a
strict
account
of
all
the
provisions
in
the
city
and
be
most
saving
and
economical
with
food
lest
it
should
fail
them
before
the
siege
was
raised
when
the
message
was
ended
the
crowds
cheered
themselves
hoarse
and
when
the
burgomaster
inquired
what
word
they
desired
him
to
send
the
prince
they
shouted
as
with
one
voice
tell
him
that
while
there
is
a
living
man
left
in
the
city
we
will
contend
for
our
liberty
and
our
religion
and
now
continued
adrian
van
der
werf
hear
the
proclamation
of
the
king
of
spain
he
invites
all
his
erring
and
repentant
subjects
in
the
netherlands
and
especially
leyden
to
return
to
his
service
and
he
will
extend
to
them
full
forgiveness
for
all
their
crimes
he
declares
that
if
any
will
lay
down
their
arms
surrender
themselves
and
become
his
loyal
subjects
once
more
that
they
shall
receive
his
pardon
and
all
shall
be
forgotten
he
has
authorized
general
valdez
to
say
that
if
the
city
will
surrender
at
once
that
the
citizens
shall
be
shown
every
mercy
no
sooner
had
the
burgomaster
ceased
to
speak
than
old
jan
van
buskirk
raised
his
voice
it
is
a
trap
believe
not
in
it
yes
yes
it
is
a
trap
stormed
the
multitude
we
will
have
none
of
it
we
will
die
to
the
last
man
before
we
will
surrender
what
right
has
that
wretch
of
a
spanish
king
to
offer
pardon
growled
gysbert
to
his
sister
and
forgive
us
indeed
and
it
is
he
that
has
been
doing
all
the
wrong
and
committing
all
the
crimes
many
thanks
to
him
truly
but
what
message
is
it
your
pleasure
that
i
shall
send
in
answer
to
this
asked
the
burgomaster
tell
him
roared
jan
who
seemed
to
have
constituted
himself
spokesman
for
the
people
that
the
fowler
plays
sweet
notes
on
his
pipe
while
he
spreads
his
net
for
the
birds
aye
aye
assented
the
crowd
approvingly
tell
him
that
is
a
good
answer
commented
van
der
werf
and
i
will
send
it
as
it
stands
now
who
will
take
advantage
of
this
pardon
for
himself
let
any
who
may
feel
so
inclined
come
forward
at
once
and
they
shall
be
sent
out
of
the
gates
to
go
their
chosen
ways
in
peace
another
tense
silence
ensued
each
person
stood
his
own
ground
stanchly
and
watched
for
any
sign
of
wavering
in
his
neighbor
presently
from
out
the
crowd
there
pushed
a
stout
old
man
who
finally
gained
the
open
space
before
the
burgomaster
i
am
a
brewer
of
utrecht
he
announced
i
do
not
live
in
this
city
and
have
no
desire
to
maintain
the
siege
i
wish
to
take
advantage
of
the
king
pardon
be
it
as
you
wish
neighbor
answered
van
der
werf
here
are
the
necessary
papers
you
shall
pass
out
unmolested
at
the
opening
of
the
gate
the
man
received
the
papers
while
the
crowd
looked
on
muttering
in
contemptuous
undertones
and
i
declared
another
who
had
shoved
his
way
to
the
front
will
also
receive
the
pardon
if
you
please
jacqueline
grasped
her
brother
arm
convulsively
dirk
willumhoog
he
whistled
softly
the
city
will
be
well
rid
of
him
to
be
sure
but
what
a
coward
when
the
two
men
had
been
furnished
with
the
proper
credentials
the
burgomaster
commanded
them
to
proceed
at
once
to
the
principal
city
gate
where
they
would
be
dismissed
to
the
spanish
army
outside
but
as
they
made
their
way
down
the
wide
breede
straat
the
fury
of
the
crowd
broke
loose
shame
shame
hissed
the
following
throng
shame
on
the
cowards
who
desert
their
countrymen
to
join
the
despicable
ranks
of
spain
thrice
shame
on
their
accursed
heads
straight
to
the
walls
of
the
city
the
multitude
pursued
the
fleeing
men
now
actually
trembling
for
their
lives
the
two
children
and
old
jan
caught
in
the
swirling
throngs
found
themselves
almost
on
the
heels
of
the
fugitives
jan
grunted
and
spluttered
his
disapproval
but
gysbert
seemed
fairly
boiling
over
in
his
wrath
especially
against
dirk

the
gate
having
been
reached
it
was
opened
but
the
smallest
crack
available
by
the
guarding
soldiers
the
brewer
from
utrecht
squeezed
his
bulky
form
with
difficulty
through
the
narrow
aperture
followed
by
the
howls
of
the
crowd
but
gysbert
could
contain
himself
no
longer
breaking
away
from
his
sister
grasp
he
rushed
up
to
the
remaining
fugitive
and
shouted
in
his
face
shame
on
thee
dirk

for
a
dog
of
a
coward
shame
shame
the
man
turned
on
him
with
so
savage
a
countenance
that
jacqueline
could
not
repress
a
frightened
scream
the
cry
attracted
the
man
attention
to
her
also
you

he
vociferated
you

rue

jacqueline
i
want
to
get
a
full
profile
in
the
little
of
the
house
in
belfry
lane
sat
the
two
children
on
an
evening
a
month
after
the
events
of
the
last
chapter
on
one
side
of
the
table
vrouw
voorhaas
bent
over
a
huge
pile
of
mending
casting
an
occasional
loving
and
solicitous
glance
at
her
two
charges
but
otherwise
quiet
silent
and
reserved
she
was
a
woman
of
large
almost
masculine
proportions
and
her
muscular
frame
knew
not
the
meaning
of
fatigue
her
features
were
plain
and
unprepossessing
to
a
degree
but
nevertheless
grave
and
intelligent
she
was
rarely
known
to
smile
and
her
manner
was
as
that
of
one
weighted
down
with
a
great
responsibility
gysbert
frequently
told
his
sister
that
vrouw
voorhaas
acted
as
though
she
had
some
dark
secret
on
her
mind
and
jacqueline
was
forced
to
admit
the
truth
of
the
remark
her
devotion
to
the
children
was
beyond
question
yet
she
seldom
exhibited
any
outward
expression
of
affection
jacqueline
bent
over
a
old
book
turning
its
pages
thoughtfully
and
drawing
her
pretty
brows
together
with
a
puzzled
expression
at
frequent
intervals
gysbert
sat
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
with
pencil
and
paper
before
him
making
a
sketch
of
his
sister
head
as
she
leaned
over
her
book
what
is
it
thou
art
reading
so
intently
he
demanded
at
length
is
an
old
volume
that
belonged
to
father
library
the
only
book
that
was
not
sold
before
we
left
louvain
answered
jacqueline
neither
she
nor
gysbert
noticed
the
startled
glance
with
which
vrouw
voorhaas
raised
her
head
at
these
words
jacqueline
continued
it
seems
to
be
all
about
medicine
thou
knowest
how
that
subject
interests
me
gysbert
i
long
when
i
grow
up
to
practice
the
healing
art
i
feel
in
some
way
as
if
the
gift
were
in
me
poof
said
the
boy
women
are
not
fashioned
to
be
physicians
they
have
other
duties
thou
art
mad
jacqueline
such
business
is
not
for
thee
ah
i
know
it
is
not
considered
a
woman
business
and
few
if
any
have
tried
it
yet
there
is
the
famous
queen
marguerite
of
navarre
they
say
she
is
the
wisest
woman
in
france
for
all
she
is
so
young
and
knows
not
only
latin
greek
and
other
languages
but
much
about
medicine
and
the
healing
art
also
i
have
been
reading
in
this
old
book
but
i
can
make
little
out
of
it
for
there
is
much
latin
in
it
of
which
i
understand
nothing
but
it
is
my
great
hope
that
some
day
i
shall
study
all
about
it
even
though
i
never
become
a
physician
while
they
were
talking
vrouw
voorhaas
gathered
up
her
work
and
without
a
word
left
the
room
no
sooner
had
she
gone
than
gysbert
leaned
across
the
table
and
spoke
to
his
sister
in
a
voice
scarcely
above
a
whisper
jacqueline
now
that
vrouw
voorhaas
is
out
of
the
way
i
want
to
tell
thee
several
things
some
of
which
i
learned
one
thing
i
have
fully
made
up
my
mind
to
do
i
am
going
to
become
a
a
gysbert
and
what
may
that
be
why
i
might
as
well
begin
at
the
beginning
and
explain
it
all
he
answered
thou
knowest
the
siege
has
lasted
now
for
over
a
month
and
things
are
beginning
to
look
black
for
us
there
is
no
more
bread
in
the
city
and
but
very
little
of
the
on
which
we
are
all
now
living
precious
glad
i
am
that
we
were
fortunate
enough
to
lay
in
an
extra
stock
of
seeds
for
our
pigeons
or
we
should
soon
be
reduced
to
feeding
on
well
i
was
in
the
square
before
the
statehouse
this
morning
and
through
listening
to
and
taking
part
in
some
of
the
gossip
there
i
learned
a
few
things
in
the
first
place
our
good
william
the
silent
can
not
possibly
raise
a
sufficient
army
to
encounter
the
besieging
troops
of
the
spaniards
that
plain
relief
must
come
in
some
other
way
but
how
god
alone
knows
however
our
wonderful
prince
is
wise
and
resourceful
let
us
not
despair
but
trust
him
to
save
us
and
do
our
best
to
help
jacqueline
i
am
going
to
do
part
i
go
to
burgomaster
van
der
werf
to
offer
myself
as
a
let
me
tell
thee
what
that
means
the
prince
wants
a
few
swift
skillful
messengers
who
will
go
out
of
the
gates
secretly
in
some
kind
of
disguise
and
make
their
way
through
the
spanish
forces
to
him
now
i
am
young
i
know
but
i
am
big
and
strong
and
i
know
my
way
around
the
walls
and
outside
the
city
as
well
and
perhaps
better
than
anyone
in
leyden
and
i
want
to
something
i
ca
sit
around
idle
while
all
are
helping
in
one
way
or
another
why
dost
thou
look
so
white
and
frightened
jacqueline
ah
gysbert
thou
must
do
this
thou
wilt
surely
be
captured
and
killed
ah
i
can
not
allow
it
nor
will
vrouw
voorhaas
vrouw
voorhaas
must
not
know
of
it
at
least
at
first
and
thou
must
not
interfere
with
me
dear
sister
i
know
that
our
father
were
he
alive
would
approve
of
my
decision
did
he
not
always
tell
us
to
be
courageous
and
would
he
not
wish
us
to
serve
our
city
in
this
great
distress
this
argument
silenced
jacqueline
remonstrances
do
what
thou
wilt
gysbert
since
thou
thinkest
that
our
father
would
approve
only
be
not
rash
and
have
a
care
for
thy
life
what
would
i
do
if
thou
wert
taken
from
me
brother
i
will
be
most
cautious
sister
never
fear
for
that
but
how
shall
we
keep
it
from
vrouw
voorhaas
she
would
lock
thee
in
a
room
and
never
let
thee
out
did
she
but
dream
of
thy
decision
thou
mayst
tell
her
that
i
am
out
helping
with
the
defence
of
the
city
if
i
fail
to
come
back
for
too
long
a
period
that
will
be
the
strict
truth
yet
not
enough
to
alarm
her
seriously
answered
gysbert
how
absurdly
worried
and
careful
she
has
been
about
us
since
the
day
we
told
her
of
the
king
pardon
and
dirk
willumhoog
she
turned
deathly
white
at
the
mention
of
his
name
and
i
thought
she
was
going
to
faint
when
we
told
her
what
he
said
before
he
left
the
gate
dost
thou
remember
gysbert
aye
but
let
me
tell
thee
something
else
jacqueline
what
dost
thou
think
of
this
i
saw
dirk
willumhoog
in
the
city
this
morning
gysbert
thou
art
surely
joking
that
can
not
be
possible
since
he
was
expelled
from
the
city
how
could
he
get
back
ask
me
not
how
he
got
back
for
i
do
not
know
but
the
best
of
it
is
that
he
did
not
see
me
and
he
was
so
disguised
that
had
it
not
been
for
certain
circumstances
i
should
never
have
known
him
i
had
strolled
up
hengist
hill
after
leaving
the
breede
straat
and
had
climbed
into
a
tree
to
get
a
better
view
of
the
spanish
army
outside
the
walls
i
was
sitting
in
the
branches
very
quietly
when
a
man
in
a
long
cloak
and
big
slouching
hat
came
out
of
the
grove
and
sat
down
right
under
my
tree
thinking
himself
alone
he
took
off
his
hat
threw
aside
his
cloak
and
then
to
my
great
surprise
pulled
off
the
thick
beard
that
covered
his
face
but
it
is
hot
i
heard
him
mutter
then
he
stood
up
and
stretched
his
arms
and
i
all
but
lost
my
hold
and
fell
out
of
the
tree
when
i
recognized
who
it
was
he
sat
down
again
and
rested
for
half
an
hour
and
i
thought
he
would
never
go
fortunately
he
did
not
once
think
of
looking
up
or
he
would
have
certainly
seen
me
at
last
he
donned
his
beard
hat
and
cloak
and
sneaked
off
never
dreaming
who
had
watched
his
every
movement
i
would
give
a
good
round
florin
to
know
what
he
is
after
ah
i
am
sure
it
is
some
harm
to
us
he
is
plotting
shuddered
jacqueline
dost
thou
recall
his
look
of
hate
on
that
dreadful
day
gysbert
he
has
some
reason
for
wishing
us
evil
that
may
or
may
not
be
answered
gysbert
at
any
rate
i
think
he
can
do
us
but
little
harm
however
thou
shouldst
be
careful
about
going
abroad
in
the
city
alone
jacqueline
thou
art
not
as
strong
as
i
i
go
nowhere
except
to
purchase
our
small
allowance
of
food
thou
knowst
vrouw
voorhaas
never
goes
out
at
all
now
and
to
visit
poor
jan
van
buskirk
once
a
day
and
take
him
some
soothing
medicine
he
says
that
nothing
helps
him
like
the
decoction
of
my
herbs
and
nothing
charms
away
his
pain
like
the
touch
of
my
hands
dost
thou
know
gysbert
that
he
has
been
obliged
to
kill
and
eat
most
of
his
pigeons
since
food
has
been
so
short
i
know
not
what
he
will
do
when
they
are
gone
we
will
share
our
food
with
him
jacqueline
he
has
always
been
so
kind
to
us
and
taught
us
how
to
raise
and
train
our
pigeons
but
now
let
us
to
rest
it
is
late
and
i
must
see
burgomaster
van
der
werf
early
poor
jacqueline
sleep
that
night
was
restless
and
tormented
by
frightful
dreams
in
which
gysbert
new
and
dangerous
vocation
and
the
evil
face
of
dirk
willumhoog
bore
no
inconspicuous
part
gysbert
on
the
contrary
slept
sweetly
and
undisturbed
as
a
year
old
baby
and
rose
next
morning
betimes
to
seek
what
fortune
he
should
meet
in
this
new
enterprise
adrian
van
der
werf
sat
alone
in
his
great
office
in
the
statehouse
his
fine
face
was
clouded
with
an
expression
of
intense
gloom
and
he
shook
his
head
gravely
as
he
looked
out
over
the
besieged
city
was
this
fair
spot
to
fall
a
prey
to
spanish
vengeance
as
its
sister
cities
had
fallen
he
saw
no
hope
in
present
prospects
for
a
better
fate
presently
an
official
opened
the
door
and
saluted
him
a
small
boy
outside
wishes
to
speak
with
your
worship
admit
him
answered
the
burgomaster
i
am
not
engaged
at
present
glancing
up
as
gysbert
entered
his
face
lighted
with
a
smile
of
recognition
ah
thou
art
the
boy
who
warned
us
of
the
approach
of
the
spaniards
thou
art
a
brave
and
thoughtful
lad
what
can
i
do
for
thee
your
worship
i
have
a
request
to
make
answered
gysbert
promptly
i
wish
to
serve
my
city
by
becoming
a
a
jumper
but
thou
art
scarce
fourteen
years
of
age
if
i
judge
rightly
it
would
be
wicked
to
expose
one
so
young
to
such
dangers
exclaimed
the
astonished
burgomaster
aye
your
worship
you
have
guessed
my
age
correctly
but
i
am
strong
and
agile
and
know
the
walls
and
outlying
districts
well
moreover
i
have
a
plan
that
i
trust
will
take
me
safely
through
the
spanish
lines
and
what
may
be
that
plan
demanded
van
der
werf
more
and
more
amazed
this
answered
the
boy
i
shall
stain
my
skin
and
hair
darker
with
walnut
juice
that
i
may
not
be
recognized
and
pretending
to
be
somewhat
i
shall
go
out
among
the
spanish
troops
peddling
healing
herbs
my
sister
raises
many
such
in
her
little
garden
and
has
taught
me
much
of
their
use
in
this
way
i
can
most
likely
get
through
the
lines
unsuspected
and
unmolested
and
deliver
any
message
to
your
faithful
ones
who
are
beyond
it
is
a
clever
scheme
admitted
the
wondering
burgomaster
and
if
thou
dost
act
thy
part
well
thou
wilt
be
fairly
safe
likewise
added
gysbert
i
have
some
carrier
pigeons
that
have
been
exceedingly
and
perchance
could
make
them
of
use
also
the
very
thing
exclaimed
van
der
werf
our
stock
of
carrier
pigeons
waxes
very
low
having
either
died
of
starvation
or
been
eaten
i
have
been
wondering
where
i
should
find
birds
to
fill
their
place
canst
thou
take
a
couple
at
a
time
with
thee
i
must
needs
send
some
to
william
the
silent
at
delft
else
we
will
get
no
more
messages
from
him
aye
i
can
bind
two
and
take
them
at
the
bottom
of
my
bag
of
herbs
answered
gysbert
i
will
wager
for
it
that
they
shall
be
delivered
safely
adrian
van
der
werf
spent
a
moment
in
silent
consideration
thou
art
a
brave
and
clever
youth
he
said
but
thou
must
know
that
thou
art
risking
much
in
this
hazardous
enterprise
however
god
will
watch
over
those
who
serve
him
come
to
me
bringing
two
carrier
pigeons
and
i
will
instruct
thee
as
to
the
message
and
gysbert
highly
pleased
departed
for
belfry
lane
whistling
lustily
one
of
the
popular
songs
of
the
day
beat
the
drums
gaily
a
beat
the
drums
gaily
and
the
spaniards
will
flee
in
the
camp
of
the
enemy
chapter
iv
in
the
camp
of
the
enemy
in
the
cold
gray
mist
of
earliest
dawn
gysbert
crept
silently
through
one
of
the
city
gates
so
changed
was
his
appearance
that
his
own
sister
would
scarcely
have
known
him
had
she
not
assisted
in
effecting
his
disguise
late
the
night
before
his
straight
light
hair
had
assumed
a
dark
brown
color
and
his
fresh
rosy
complexion
had
suddenly
become
as
swarthy
as
any
spaniard
his
dutch
blouse
cap
and
wooden
sabots
were
exchanged
for
garments
of
a
more
foreign
cut
and
in
his
hand
he
bore
a
large
bag
of
assorted
herbs
both
green
and
dried
thanks
to
an
almost
daily
study
of
the
spanish
camp
from
his
perch
on
hengist
hill
he
had
selected
the
most
favorable
quarter
for
his
egress
through
the
enemies
ranks
the
situation
farthest
removed
from
the
headquarters
of
commander
valdez
the
camp
had
very
much
the
appearance
of
a
little
city
of
mushroom
growth
rows
upon
rows
of
tents
and
here
and
there
a
hut
of
larger
proportions
hastily
constructed
of
boards
in
the
middle
of
one
tented
street
had
been
erected
a
rude
shrine
protected
by
an
awning
at
which
knelt
a
priest
celebrating
the
early
morning
mass
the
tinkle
of
the
silver
bell
calling
to
service
was
the
only
sound
that
broke
the
silence
gysbert
proceeded
cautiously
rejoicing
at
every
step
that
took
him
unmolested
on
his
way
when
suddenly
a
rough
command
arrested
his
progress
halt
the
password
what
art
thou
doing
here
answered
gysbert
glibly
thanking
his
stars
that
the
burgomaster
had
not
failed
to
inform
him
of
the
spanish
password
for
the
day
van
der
werf
had
two
or
three
trusted
spies
in
the
spanish
army
who
kept
him
well
posted
as
to
their
daily
plans
and
watchwords
is
correct
enough
replied
the
sentinel
but
who
art
thou
and
where
art
thou
going
so
early
i
am
a
glipper
answered
gysbert
in
a
nasal
voice
i
come
from
the
city
we
are
starving
there
i
sell
these
healing
herbs
in
order
to
get
some
food
now
a
glipper
was
the
name
given
to
any
hollander
who
sympathized
with
spain
and
they
were
as
a
rule
very
favorably
regarded
by
the
spaniards
gysbert
being
naturally
truthful
disliked
exceedingly
to
thus
falsify
himself
but
consoled
his
conscience
with
the
motto
fair
in
war
the
sentinel
looked
him
over
suspiciously
but
concluded
that
he
had
not
the
appearance
of
a
genuine
dutch
boy
moreover
it
was
evident
from
his
speech
and
expression
that
he
was
not
blessed
with
more
than
half
the
usual
quantity
of
wits
well
little
fool
i
will
let
thee
pass
provided
thou
wilt
supply
me
with
something
healing
for
this
wound
in
my
hand
where
the
gunpowder
from
my
musket
burned
me
yesterday
morn
gysbert
hunted
in
his
bag
brought
out
a
small
bundle
of
dried
leaves
and
recited
as
if
by
rote
thou
shalt
steep
these
in
boiling
water
thou
shalt
make
a
poultice
with
the
leaves
thus
steeped
thou
shalt
bind
it
on
thy
wound
in
two
days
thou
shalt
be
better
thanks
little
numbskull
thy
poultice
and
not
thy
wits
have
saved
thee
and
now
cut
away
quickly
availing
himself
not
too
hastily
of
the
permission
gysbert
strolled
away
as
if
there
were
not
a
thought
of
danger
in
his
mind
but
no
sooner
was
he
out
of
sight
of
the
sentinel
than
he
took
to
his
heels
and
ran
swiftly
and
silently
through
the
still
sleeping
camp
if
only
i
can
reach
the
outskirts
before
they
waken
all
will
be
well
he
thought
once
again
only
at
the
edge
of
the
encampment
he
was
challenged
by
another
sentry
but
the
password
given
he
was
allowed
to
go
on
without
question
by
a
sentinel
whose
one
sleepy
thought
was
the
bed
into
which
he
hoped
soon
to
turn
once
on
the
to
delft
gysbert
troubles
were
for
the
time
over
and
he
abandoned
himself
to
a
leisurely
walk
and
to
the
enjoyment
of
his
breakfast
a
stale
which
he
munched
contentedly
as
he
trudged
along
then
the
sun
rose
the
morning
mist
evaporated
and
the
waters
of
the
canal
sparkled
like
jewels
in
the
clear
air
of
the
july
day
a
lazy
boat
with
one
big
brown
sail
edged
its
way
slowly
along
the
canal
in
the
direction
of
delft
i
might
as
well
save
my
strength
argued
gysbert
to
himself
and
what
is
more
i
have
time
in
quantities
to
spare
hi
herr
captain
i
pray
you
take
me
on
your
gallant
bark
the
captain
looked
up
from
a
sail
he
was
mending
and
scanned
the
boy
from
head
to
foot
i
like
thee
not
he
answered
thou
hast
too
much
of
the
spaniard
about
thee
little
frog
thine
own
two
good
feet
can
carry
thee
gysbert
was
secretly
delighted
that
his
disguise
was
so
effective
but
hastened
to
add
good
herr
captain
you
are
much
mistaken
look
you
and
from
the
bottom
of
his
bag
he
pulled
out
two
pigeons
bound
and
helpless
these
be
carriers
he
announced
i
am
commissioned
by
burgomaster
van
der
werf
to
take
them
to
our
prince
at
delft
also
i
have
a
message
but
that
is
in
my
mind
instantly
the
captain
surly
manner
changed
come
aboard
come
thou
aboard
he
called
heartily
thou
art
a
small
lad
but
a
clever
one
here
catch
this
plank
in
two
minutes
gysbert
comfortably
ensconced
in
the
stern
had
curled
himself
up
to
finish
the
morning
nap
with
which
his
early
expedition
had
seriously
interfered
in
due
time
this
vessel
reached
the
gate
catherine
the
principal
entrance
to
delft
and
gysbert
disembarking
thanked
the
captain
for
his
assistance
no
thanks
to
me
youngster
replied
the
man
it
all
for
the
good
cause
and
my
name
is
joris
fruytiers
shouldst
thou
ever
meet
me
and
need
my
help
again
gysbert
set
off
with
all
speed
to
the
the
palace
where
william
the
silent
held
his
headquarters
one
of
the
boy
greatest
desires
in
life
was
to
see
and
speak
with
this
great
father
of
his
country
the
prince
of
orange
who
had
been
for
several
years
his
hero
and
idol
hence
his
errand
was
all
the
more
delightful
to
him
since
it
was
to
afford
him
this
coveted
opportunity
but
this
time
he
was
doomed
to
disappointment
the
prince
was
away
at
rotterdam
and
his
commissioner
paul
buys
took
the
message
in
his
stead
it
was
to
the
effect
that
the
people
of
leyden
implored
immediate
help
they
were
on
the
point
of
facing
starvation
and
feared
lest
the
weaker
ones
would
lose
courage
and
yield
up
the
city
paul
buys
sent
word
back
to
van
der
werf
that
the
prince
of
orange
was
on
the
point
of
putting
into
execution
a
scheme
of
release
that
he
had
long
been
considering
and
would
send
word
by
one
of
the
carrier
pigeons
when
he
was
ready
to
put
it
into
effect
buys
then
told
gysbert
that
hereafter
he
would
not
have
to
come
as
far
as
delft
with
the
pigeons
but
could
leave
them
at
the
farmhouse
of
julius
van
shaick
not
far
beyond
leyden
from
whence
they
would
be
conveyed
to
delft
in
safety
before
the
boy
left
for
his
homeward
journey
buys
superintended
him
in
the
disposal
of
such
a
meal
as
he
had
not
seen
for
many
a
long
day
and
he
sighed
only
that
he
could
not
convey
some
of
it
to
jacqueline
and
vrouw
voorhaas
trusting
to
no
canal
vessel
but
relying
mainly
on
the
swiftness
of
his
strong
young
legs
he
accomplished
the
fifteen
miles
back
to
leyden
in
four
hours
and
at
nightfall
reached
once
more
the
outskirts
of
the
spanish
camp
but
his
passage
through
the
enemy
midst
was
not
destined
to
be
as
uneventful
as
that
of
the
morning
the
camp
streets
were
bustling
with
life
and
activity
soldiers
promenaded
up
and
down
women
the
few
who
had
chosen
to
follow
their
husbands
fortunes
called
to
each
other
shrilly
from
the
and
even
some
children
ran
hither
and
thither
in
garments
of
startling
untidiness
gysbert
hoped
to
escape
notice
in
the
general
confusion
but
in
this
he
was
mistaken
a
sudden
hand
was
laid
in
no
gentle
manner
on
his
shoulder
and
a
voice
from
behind
demanded
the
password
he
replied
confidently
in
that
thou
art
much
in
error
answered
the
soldier
dost
thou
think
that
the
password
does
not
change
from
day
to
day
thou
art
twelve
hours
too
late
come
thou
with
me
and
he
led
gysbert
to
the
door
of
a
tent
which
was
empty
and
lighted
only
by
a
large
fire
outside
here
alonzo
de
rova
he
called
to
a
burly
sentinel
guard
this
young
interloper
till
i
have
time
to
report
him
to
commander
valdez
now
thought
gysbert
i
caught
in
earnest
but
without
seeming
to
possess
any
wits
i
will
try
to
use
those
the
good
god
has
given
me
as
skillfully
as
i
can
alonzo
de
rova
paced
up
and
down
before
the
tent
door
for
a
time
apparently
utterly
ignoring
the
boy
yet
in
reality
watching
him
keenly
gysbert
on
his
part
kept
his
eyes
well
open
yet
assumed
the
vacant
gaze
he
had
attempted
in
the
morning
presently
he
took
up
a
charred
stick
from
the
fire
that
happened
to
lie
near
him
and
with
it
commenced
to
make
some
strokes
on
the
white
canvas
of
the
tent
what
art
thou
doing
demanded
de
rova
and
he
drew
near
curiously
to
examine
the
marks
why
by
the
pope
he
exclaimed
it
is
myself
my
very
self
as
i
stand
here
with
my
musket
thou
canst
indeed
draw
little
stranger
who
art
thou
i
am
a
glipper
repeated
gysbert
monotonously
i
sell
healing
herbs
i
also
can
draw
art
thou
indeed
a
glipper
well
that
is
not
so
bad
and
look
thou
here
canst
draw
a
good
portrait
of
me
on
fine
paper
aye
i
can
answered
gysbert
in
his
adopted
nasal
tone
well
thou
hast
evidently
not
all
the
wits
that
god
usually
gives
us
but
thou
shalt
try
said
de
rova
and
he
drew
from
his
belongings
a
sheet
of
paper
and
what
stood
for
a
pencil
in
those
days
illustration
gysbert
draws
the
portrait
of
alonzo
de
rova
draw
me
well
little
glipper
make
of
me
a
fine
figure
for
i
wish
to
send
it
to
my
sweetheart
in
madrid
and
we
will
see
what
can
be
done
for
thee
drawing
himself
up
to
his
full
height
he
assumed
a
martial
position
ready
for
the
likeness
he
was
truly
a
splendid
specimen
of
a
soldier
and
evidently
very
proud
of
his
magnificent
proportions
gysbert
seized
the
pencil
and
paper
and
went
to
work
with
a
will
never
had
he
striven
so
hard
to
give
satisfaction
never
had
so
much
been
at
stake
never
had
his
art
stood
him
in
such
good
stead
when
the
picture
was
finished
alonzo
de
rova
was
profuse
in
expressing
his
wonder
and
delight
and
slipped
a
coin
into
the
boy
hand
and
now
little
artist
fly
slip
away
under
the
back
of
the
tent
when
i
am
not
looking
and
no
one
will
be
the
wiser
the
captain
who
caught
thee
is
a
good
friend
of
mine
and
beside
i
will
tell
him
thou
art
a
glipper
remember
alonzo
de
rova
and
if
thou
dost
ever
come
to
the
camp
again
i
will
put
thee
in
the
way
of
earning
a
pretty
penny
for
there
are
many
like
me
who
would
gladly
sit
for
their
portraits
i
doubt
not
but
that
thou
couldst
make
a
florin
a
day
at
that
work
one
more
word
of
advice
the
password
for
is
farewell
with
that
he
turned
his
back
on
the
boy
and
commenced
pacing
up
and
down
before
the
fire
gysbert
lost
not
a
moment
time
but
acting
on
the
friendly
suggestion
slipped
out
through
a
loose
flap
at
the
back
of
the
tent
thanks
to
the
now
dense
darkness
and
his
knowledge
of
the
password
he
escaped
safely
through
the
camp
to
the
cow
gate
where
giving
a
peculiar
knock
previously
concerted
between
himself
and
the
gatekeeper
he
once
more
stood
secure
within
the
city
walls
speeding
homeward
to
belfry
lane
he
murmured
to
himself
i
have
accomplished
the
mission
without
mishap
and
have
also
made
two
friends
on
the
whole
i
think
i
have
not
done
so
badly
the
decision
of
jacqueline
chapter
v
the
decision
of
jacqueline
on
the
morning
of
gysbert
first
venture
into
the
midst
of
the
enemy
jacqueline
rose
with
a
very
heavy
heart
she
helped
her
brother
with
the
last
preparations
for
his
departure
aided
him
in
escaping
the
vigilant
eye
of
vrouw
voorhaas
who
was
already
at
work
though
the
hour
was
so
early
and
bade
him
a
tearful
farewell
as
he
sped
down
the
silent
street
but
her
mind
was
full
of
foreboding
and
she
felt
as
though
she
could
never
live
through
the
time
till
he
should
return
in
safety
to
pass
the
weary
hours
and
otherwise
occupy
her
thoughts
she
assisted
vrouw
voorhaas
with
the
daily
routine
of
housework
cleaned
the
and
fed
her
eighteen
remaining
pets
with
a
scanty
supply
of
their
rapidly
diminishing
stock
of
corn
vrouw
voorhaas
had
many
questions
to
ask
concerning
the
whereabouts
of
gysbert
whom
she
had
not
seen
that
day
jacqueline
parried
these
as
best
she
could
explaining
that
he
had
gone
off
early
to
execute
some
errands
for
burgomaster
van
der
werf
her
companion
unconvinced
that
all
was
as
it
should
be
and
vaguely
uneasy
about
her
youngest
charge
accepted
the
explanation
somewhat
distrustfully
to
change
the
subject
jacqueline
began
to
talk
about
their
supply
of
food
and
to
make
plans
for
husbanding
it
to
the
last
crumb
while
she
was
talking
her
gaze
suddenly
riveted
itself
on
the
tall
form
of
the
older
woman
why
vrouw
voorhaas
she
exclaimed
how
thin
thou
art
growing
see
thy
dress
dost
hang
about
thee
in
great
folds
and
thine
arms
almost
show
the
bones
surely
we
have
not
yet
come
to
the
pass
when
such
loss
of
flesh
would
be
noticeable
what
hast
thou
been
doing
nothing
nothing
child
exclaimed
the
woman
hastily
i
eat
as
heartily
as
our
supply
of
food
will
permit
but
the
hot
weather
always
did
reduce
my
flesh
hurry
away
now
and
see
what
thou
canst
purchase
at
the
market
but
try
not
to
be
seen
too
prominently
young
people
are
not
too
safe
in
the
streets
in
these
wild
times
art
going
to
visit
old
jan
yes
answered
jacqueline
he
grows
worse
and
worse
though
i
do
my
best
to
aid
him
there
seems
to
be
something
else
ailing
him
beside
just
his
lumbago
but
i
can
not
quite
make
out
what
it
is
and
he
will
not
see
a
physician
i
will
go
out
and
gather
some
fresh
herbs
now
to
take
with
me
the
girl
took
her
little
basket
and
went
out
to
her
patch
of
garden
at
the
back
of
the
house
gay
flowers
bloomed
in
one
half
of
it
but
the
other
was
devoted
to
the
cultivation
of
the
medicinal
herbs
whose
healing
properties
she
had
carefully
studied
in
the
old
book
belonging
to
her
father
first
she
gathered
a
bouquet
of
late
roses
and
jasmine
to
cheer
the
eyes
of
old
jan
and
then
stooping
among
the
herbs
selected
those
most
calculated
to
help
his
poor
infirm
body
when
this
was
done
she
the
house
added
some
and
a
bottle
of
vrouw
voorhaas
cooling
homemade
wine
and
proceeded
on
her
errand
of
comfort
jan
van
buskirk
home
was
on
a
tiny
street
just
off
the
marendorfstrasse
and
to
reach
it
jacqueline
was
obliged
to
take
a
rather
circuitous
route
that
led
through
the
poorest
section
of
the
city
what
she
saw
there
on
that
day
tore
her
gentle
heart
with
an
agony
of
sympathy
the
weather
was
extremely
hot
and
oppressive
and
every
one
seemed
to
have
sought
the
coolness
of
the
shaded
street
in
preference
to
the
little
suffocating
rooms
pale
emaciated
children
thronged
the
doorways
many
gnawing
on
dry
unsightly
bones
from
which
the
last
vestige
of
meat
had
long
since
disappeared
sick
babies
wailed
fretfully
white
haggard
men
and
women
strove
in
vain
to
comfort
them
and
here
and
there
lay
stretched
on
an
improvised
cot
the
form
of
some
person
desperately
ill
moaning
piteously
jacqueline
contrasted
the
scene
with
these
same
comfortable
happy
people
of
a
few
months
before
and
her
heart
grew
rebellious
at
the
mighty
suffering
entailed
in
just
the
little
word
war
is
there
no
help
no
help
for
it
she
asked
herself
jan
van
buskirk
was
worse
unquestionably
worse
than
when
she
had
visited
him
before
and
his
condition
alarmed
her
seriously
he
was
tossing
from
side
to
side
rolling
his
head
feverishly
and
muttering
incoherent
words
nor
did
he
seem
in
the
least
to
recognize
his
little
friend
jacqueline
quietly
determined
that
it
was
high
time
he
had
more
expert
medical
advice
than
she
could
offer
and
went
out
hastily
to
seek
the
nearest
physician
pieter
de
witt
was
hard
to
find
for
his
duties
were
long
and
arduous
in
these
dreadful
days
but
finally
she
discovered
him
in
the
house
of
a
poor
family
all
sick
but
the
mother
who
could
hardly
drag
herself
around
hearing
jacqueline
errand
he
made
haste
to
accompany
her
one
glance
at
the
unconscious
jan
told
him
the
tale
my
girl
he
said
turning
to
jacqueline
go
away
from
here
as
speedily
as
thou
canst
this
man
has
the
plague
it
has
broken
out
in
several
parts
of
the
city
owing
to
bad
food
or
none
at
all
and
this
man
has
caught
it
thou
art
exposing
thyself
to
a
terrible
disease
and
almost
certain
death
this
is
no
place
for
thee
go
home
and
i
will
take
care
of
the
man
to
the
best
of
my
ability
but
i
doubt
if
he
will
live
even
so
jacqueline
eyes
opened
wide
with
a
startled
look
and
she
glanced
uncertainly
at
jan
the
sick
man
stirred
restlessly
then
with
a
sudden
cry
muttered
her
name
in
his
feverish
sleep
at
that
word
the
girl
formed
her
decision
i
will
not
go
de
witt
this
man
has
been
a
friend
to
me
and
mine
ever
since
i
can
remember
i
do
not
fear
the
plague
and
even
if
i
did
it
would
not
keep
me
from
giving
all
the
aid
i
could
to
jan
van
buskirk
moreover
i
know
a
little
about
medicine
myself
having
read
it
in
an
old
book
in
my
possession
i
have
raised
healing
herbs
and
i
also
possess
one
which
has
the
power
they
say
to
protect
from
such
diseases
if
carried
about
the
person
i
will
always
have
it
by
me
for
i
wish
to
help
you
in
nursing
this
my
friend
back
to
life
and
health
de
witt
looked
her
over
for
a
moment
in
silent
astonishment
then
he
spoke
thou
art
a
brave
maiden
whoever
thou
art
and
i
would
that
there
were
many
more
like
thee
help
me
thou
shalt
if
such
is
thy
determination
and
the
good
god
will
bless
thee
and
protect
thee
from
all
harm
there
is
much
in
having
absolutely
no
fear
of
this
contagion
and
i
see
thou
hast
none
with
thy
help
we
may
perhaps
save
our
old
friend
and
neighbor
together
they
labored
over
the
old
man
and
before
he
left
the
doctor
expressed
his
amazed
approval
of
the
skill
and
knowledge
exhibited
by
this
fair
slip
of
a
girl
in
tending
and
administering
to
the
sick
beyond
this
too
something
in
her
manner
her
look
and
her
speech
indefinably
recalled
to
him
old
recollections
thou
dost
constantly
put
me
in
mind
of
some
one
he
remarked
finally
hadst
thou
ever
any
relation
who
was
a
physician
what
is
thy
father
i
have
no
father
answered
the
girl
with
the
reticence
she
had
learned
to
exhibit
through
vrouw
voorhaas
teaching
he
is
long
since
dead
but
what
is
thy
last
name
persisted
the
good
doctor
coovenden
replied
jacqueline
with
the
hesitancy
she
could
never
quite
overcome
in
pronouncing
this
assumed
title
coovenden
ah
it
is
not
a
name
that
i
recognize
and
yet
there
is
something
i
know
not
what
which
stirs
me
and
he
went
away
shaking
his
head
thoughtfully
on
her
way
home
jacqueline
stopped
at
the
public
market
to
purchase
what
scarce
supply
of
provisions
she
was
able
to
obtain
but
this
is
a
miserable
little
cabbage
she
expostulated
mildly
to
the
huckster
who
served
her
and
see
this
has
scarce
any
meat
upon
it
be
watery
soup
that
is
made
from
this
mess
and
lucky
thou
art
to
have
any
soup
at
all
answered
the
i
tell
thee
girl
the
time
is
coming
when
we
shall
be
glad
to
eat
the
grass
that
grows
in
the
streets
and
that
not
far
distant
either
i
for
one
would
gladly
see
the
gates
opened
to
the
spaniards
they
are
better
at
least
than
slow
starvation
jacqueline
shrank
away
from
her
at
these
words
so
like
disloyalty
to
the
great
cause
and
hurried
home
with
the
news
she
had
to
tell
as
the
day
wore
on
vrouw
voorhaas
became
more
and
more
uneasy
about
gysbert
and
questioned
his
sister
so
closely
about
his
absence
that
she
had
hard
work
quieting
the
woman
fears
and
at
the
same
time
hiding
the
truth
about
him
she
herself
was
beset
by
more
definite
terrors
for
his
safety
than
vrouw
voorhaas
could
even
guess
and
though
she
did
not
expect
gysbert
before
nightfall
counted
the
moments
with
agitation
then
darkness
came
and
the
two
partook
of
their
frugal
supper
laying
aside
a
generous
portion
for
the
boy
one
by
one
the
stars
twinkled
out
jacqueline
sitting
by
the
window
tried
to
count
them
to
distract
her
thoughts
her
mind
reverted
again
and
again
to
the
scenes
of
the
morning
and
the
pictures
of
the
suffering
she
had
witnessed
would
not
fade
from
her
consciousness
as
she
sat
leaning
her
head
against
the
casement
she
was
suddenly
startled
by
having
two
hands
clapped
over
her
eyes
and
a
voice
whispering
in
her
ear
guess
who
it
is
gysbert
she
exclaimed
how
didst
thou
get
in
hush
i
slipped
in
through
the
garden
and
climbed
to
my
window
up
the
i
did
not
want
vrouw
voorhaas
to
see
my
disguise
and
have
washed
it
all
off
and
changed
my
clothes
where
is
she
in
her
room
answered
his
sister
and
right
anxious
about
thee
i
can
warrant
but
tell
me
all
about
it
gysbert
in
hasty
sentences
the
boy
told
her
of
his
day
adventures
she
listened
with
breathless
interest
and
shuddered
not
a
few
times
at
the
narrowness
of
his
escapes
then
she
recounted
to
him
her
own
experiences
and
told
of
jan
van
buskirk
illness
and
danger
when
she
had
finished
they
sat
together
in
the
darkness
for
a
long
time
without
speaking
finally
jacqueline
took
her
brother
hand
in
hers
and
said
gysbert
thine
own
bravery
and
the
dark
scenes
i
have
witnessed
have
set
me
thinking
and
i
have
made
my
resolve
since
thou
hast
given
thyself
to
the
dangerous
task
of
assisting
our
beloved
city
i
too
can
do
no
less
than
devote
myself
to
the
relief
of
some
of
its
suffering
i
shall
seek
de
witt
and
ask
him
to
allow
me
to
accompany
him
in
his
visits
to
the
sick
and
starving
i
can
aid
in
nursing
them
at
least
since
god
has
given
me
that
power
gysbert
returned
his
sister
clasp
but
continued
in
silence
for
some
moments
truth
to
tell
he
was
struggling
with
a
lump
that
had
risen
in
his
throat
and
was
glad
that
the
darkness
hid
the
tears
that
had
gathered
under
his
lashes
the
experience
of
the
last
few
days
and
weeks
had
helped
to
give
him
a
poise
beyond
his
years
but
his
admiration
for
his
sister
quiet
courage
almost
deprived
him
of
words
with
which
to
express
it
presently
however
he
got
up
and
put
his
arms
around
her
neck
jacqueline
he
said
trying
to
master
the
huskiness
in
his
voice
thou
art
very
brave
i
would
rather
go
ten
times
into
the
heart
of
the
spanish
army
than
once
into
a
room
with
the
plague
but
thou
art
right
it
is
thy
destined
work
since
thou
hast
chosen
it
and
our
father
were
he
here
would
surely
say
done
the
coming
of
the
first
pigeon
chapter
vi
the
coming
of
the
first
pigeon
the
middle
of
august
found
the
conditions
in
leyden
in
no
way
improved
but
rather
the
worse
being
just
so
many
weeks
nearer
starvation
the
poor
had
reached
a
point
where
they
were
indeed
glad
to
get
what
nourishment
they
might
from
the
grass
that
grew
in
the
streets
and
even
the
leaves
from
the
trees
that
shaded
the
canals
even
the
rich
now
suffered
from
the
scantiness
of
provisions
and
were
fain
to
draw
in
their
belts
tightly
to
lessen
the
gnawing
of
constant
hunger
jacqueline
and
gysbert
had
lost
their
fresh
rosy
complexions
and
the
roundness
of
their
youthful
curves
and
looked
white
and
thin
yet
they
still
fared
better
than
some
gysbert
had
made
seven
trips
through
the
spanish
lines
each
time
bearing
away
two
carrier
pigeons
and
bringing
back
when
he
could
a
little
supply
of
fresh
food
in
his
bag
the
six
remaining
birds
they
had
decided
to
kill
and
eat
one
a
week
so
that
they
might
have
at
least
a
taste
of
fresh
untainted
meat
occasionally
it
had
cost
jacqueline
many
a
pang
to
thus
sacrifice
her
pets
but
she
could
not
see
her
dear
ones
suffer
when
it
was
in
her
power
to
give
them
food
gysbert
latest
excursion
outside
the
city
walls
had
been
successful
and
without
any
of
the
excitement
that
had
attended
his
first
trip
he
had
chosen
an
entirely
different
quarter
through
which
to
pass
had
met
with
either
a
friendly
reception
or
indifference
from
those
he
met
and
who
freely
purchased
his
herbs
he
was
taken
without
question
for
a
glipper
as
he
had
announced
himself
to
be
and
his
presence
soon
became
a
familiar
figure
in
their
midst
then
too
these
expeditions
were
of
much
shorter
duration
than
his
first
since
instead
of
travelling
all
the
way
to
delft
he
had
only
to
leave
his
message
and
the
pigeons
at
the
farmhouse
of
julius
van
schaick
a
short
distance
from
the
city
he
had
thus
far
managed
also
to
escape
the
vigilance
of
vrouw
voorhaas
who
now
accepted
without
question
the
explanation
of
his
executing
errands
for
the
burgomaster
and
what
of
jacqueline
plague
now
raged
through
all
the
poorer
sections
of
the
city
a
dread
disease
brought
on
by
improper
nourishment
or
none
at
all
de
witt
and
jacqueline
went
their
daily
rounds
cheering
comforting
and
administering
medicine
and
nourishment
on
every
side
never
was
a
presence
more
welcome
in
a
sick
room
than
that
of
the
slim
fair
girl
whom
many
in
their
delirium
took
to
be
an
angel
never
was
a
touch
more
deft
light
and
soothing
than
hers
by
her
tender
care
jan
van
buskirk
had
been
nursed
through
the
awful
scourge
he
was
still
as
weak
as
a
baby
yet
able
to
crawl
about
his
room
listlessly
and
inquire
after
the
progress
of
the
siege
his
admiration
for
and
devotion
to
the
girl
who
had
brought
him
safely
through
his
peril
was
beyond
all
expression
and
he
did
little
else
when
she
was
near
than
follow
her
with
his
eyes
in
an
ecstasy
of
dumb
admiration
vrouw
voorhaas
utterly
disapproved
of
jacqueline
mission
to
the
sick
and
spared
no
pains
to
make
her
disapproval
known
she
was
constantly
in
terror
lest
the
girl
herself
should
become
infected
and
scolded
muttered
and
sighed
whenever
jacqueline
prepared
to
go
out
but
the
young
girl
determination
was
too
firm
to
be
shaken
by
the
older
woman
expostulations
and
her
interest
and
devotion
to
the
work
had
grown
with
her
increasing
responsibility
de
witt
secretly
marvelled
at
her
quiet
firmness
skill
and
unflinching
courage
more
and
more
did
he
rack
his
brains
to
elucidate
the
mystery
of
her
strange
resemblance
to
someone
he
had
once
known
or
seen
but
without
result
jacqueline
come
up
to
hengist
hill
with
me
said
gysbert
one
hot
oppressive
day
about
the
twentieth
of
august
thou
dost
look
white
and
tired
and
needest
a
little
change
of
air
and
besides
i
want
to
talk
to
thee
ah
gysbert
the
day
is
too
hot
and
i
am
very
tired
let
us
rest
here
in
the
house
instead
replied
the
girl
wearily
nay
the
air
is
fresh
and
cool
on
the
hill
and
i
have
yet
another
reason
for
the
expedition
come
with
me
and
thou
wilt
not
regret
it
yielding
to
his
wish
jacqueline
accompanied
him
through
the
blazing
streets
striving
for
once
not
to
see
the
misery
that
now
lay
open
to
the
daylight
all
about
them
but
gysbert
was
right
the
hill
was
a
decided
improvement
on
the
heated
atmosphere
of
the
town
the
grove
was
cool
and
pleasant
and
a
refreshing
breeze
swept
the
summit
they
sat
down
in
the
shadow
of
the
old
fortress
and
drew
in
great
breaths
of
the
salt
air
ah
it
is
good
to
be
here
exclaimed
gysbert
art
thou
not
glad
we
came
jacqueline
and
now
let
me
ask
a
question
answer
truly
what
hast
thou
had
to
eat
oh
i
had
plenty
answered
the
girl
evasively
the
weather
is
so
hot
that
i
can
not
eat
much
now
look
thou
here
he
replied
for
breakfast
this
morning
we
had
some
watery
gruel
of
our
pigeon
grain
and
a
thin
slice
of
apiece
i
saw
thee
eat
the
gruel
but
the
cake
disappeared
quickly
in
some
mysterious
way
jacqueline
didst
thou
save
it
to
take
to
jan
well
yes
i
suppose
so
she
faltered
cornered
so
cleverly
that
she
could
not
deny
it
very
well
replied
gysbert
with
decision
then
i
will
tell
him
the
next
time
i
go
there
that
thou
art
starving
thyself
to
feed
him
no
no
gysbert
she
cried
in
genuine
alarm
thou
must
not
do
that
it
would
grieve
him
unto
death
for
i
have
told
him
that
we
have
plenty
ah
does
that
worry
thee
then
if
thou
wilt
do
something
to
please
i
promise
not
to
tell
him
yes
yes
said
jacqueline
eagerly
anything
gysbert
will
i
do
if
thou
wilt
only
keep
that
secret
the
boy
did
not
answer
but
running
to
the
wall
of
the
fortress
lifted
a
stone
and
took
from
the
hollow
underneath
something
which
he
brought
to
his
sister
it
was
the
legs
and
body
of
a
wild
rabbit
which
had
been
prepared
and
cooked
evidently
before
an
open
fire
why
gysbert
exclaimed
jacqueline
in
astonishment
where
didst
thou
get
this
i
brought
down
the
rabbit
with
a
stone
here
on
the
hill
early
this
morning
then
i
skinned
him
dressed
him
built
a
fire
and
roasted
him
before
it
and
hid
him
away
in
a
cool
place
for
our
treat
this
afternoon
thou
must
eat
exactly
half
of
it
now
or
i
will
tell
jan
all
about
thy
deception
but
vrouw
voorhaas
said
the
girl
doubtfully
we
ought
to
take
some
of
it
to
her
nay
he
answered
i
have
watched
her
and
i
know
what
she
does
also
she
would
thank
us
and
put
it
aside
only
to
present
it
to
us
at
another
meal
saying
she
could
not
eat
it
herself
and
what
is
more
she
never
would
eat
it
if
we
left
it
till
it
rotted
away
so
we
might
just
as
well
finish
it
now
together
they
divided
the
doubtful
dainty
and
devoured
it
as
though
it
were
the
perfection
of
epicurean
cookery
never
did
a
meal
taste
sweeter
to
these
children
as
they
sat
nibbling
the
last
vestige
of
meat
from
the
bones
and
feeling
new
life
renewed
within
them
now
said
gysbert
when
they
had
finished
let
me
tell
thee
all
about
my
last
trip
through
the
besieging
lines
yesterday
and
the
messages
i
bore
mynheer
van
der
werf
sent
very
discouraged
word
to
our
good
prince
of
orange
the
city
he
said
was
on
the
brink
of
starvation
the
bread
was
gone
and
the
would
hold
out
but
four
days
more
moreover
the
people
had
fulfilled
the
promise
made
in
the
beginning
of
the
siege
they
had
held
out
two
months
with
food
and
one
month
without
and
human
strength
could
do
no
more
mynheer
paul
buys
himself
was
at
the
farmhouse
and
took
the
message
and
the
pigeons
he
said
the
number
of
birds
was
now
sufficient
and
i
need
bring
no
more
unless
these
should
all
return
before
the
siege
was
over
then
he
sent
by
word
of
mouth
this
reply
to
the
burgomaster
prince
begs
you
to
hold
out
a
few
days
more
as
his
scheme
for
relief
has
already
begun
to
be
put
into
execution
in
a
day
or
two
a
carrier
pigeon
will
come
from
him
telling
all
about
it
jacqueline
i
have
guessed
what
that
relief
is
going
to
be
a
few
chance
words
dropped
by
mynheer
buys
and
an
exclamation
from
the
burgomaster
has
made
me
certain
of
it
ah
it
is
a
great
thought
great
indeed
and
like
our
wonderful
prince
to
dare
it
canst
thou
imagine
what
it
is
nay
said
the
girl
wonderingly
i
can
not
look
cried
gysbert
pointing
in
the
direction
of
the
ocean
dost
thou
see
that
huge
bulk
across
the
rhine
about
five
miles
from
here
that
is
the
greatest
outer
barrier
the
see
how
it
keeps
back
the
ocean
dost
thou
guess
now
what
is
happening
not
hesitated
the
girl
not
that
the
dykes
have
been
pierced
just
that
just
that
cried
her
brother
is
it
not
wonderful
the
prince
is
calling
the
ocean
to
his
aid
since
he
can
not
raise
an
army
the
spaniards
will
drown
like
rats
in
a
tank
jacqueline
looked
doubtful
and
not
quite
convinced
but
the
land
she
said
it
will
ruin
all
the
farms
and
crops
between
here
and
the
ocean
and
think
of
all
the
labor
that
has
been
spent
on
the
dykes
to
shut
out
the
sea
when
will
they
ever
be
able
to
rebuild
these
barriers
and
shut
out
the
waters
that
will
all
come
in
good
time
he
replied
first
it
is
most
important
to
get
rid
of
this
spanish
pest
did
i
not
hear
mynheer
van
der
werf
himself
mutter
a
drowned
land
than
a
lost
one
it
was
this
exclamation
that
put
me
on
the
track
dost
say
that
the
prince
sends
word
that
the
scheme
is
already
begun
asked
jacqueline
yes
and
i
think
i
know
what
he
has
done
mynheer
buys
was
telling
me
that
he
has
but
lately
been
to
kappelle
and
schiedam
i
will
wager
that
they
have
pierced
the
dykes
all
the
way
from
here
to
rotterdam
and
even
as
far
as
kappelle
but
the
tide
does
not
rise
high
at
this
time
of
the
year
and
there
is
only
an
east
wind
so
that
the
water
flows
in
slowly
but
see
see
and
he
pointed
far
off
in
the
sky
where
a
tiny
speck
floated
a
mere
golden
moat
in
the
sunshine
i
feel
certain
that
is
one
of
our
pigeons
jacqueline
he
flies
like
of
orange
thou
hast
good
eyes
gysbert
i
can
see
nothing
but
a
faint
speck
let
us
watch
it
though
together
they
waited
in
breathless
suspense
while
the
speck
drew
nearer
and
assumed
more
definite
shape
look
how
the
left
wing
droops
a
trifle
i
that
is
of
orange
cried
gysbert
in
an
incredibly
short
time
the
bird
had
passed
the
limits
of
the
city
wall
had
drawn
closer
and
closer
and
at
last
passed
directly
over
their
heads
so
close
to
the
summit
of
the
hill
was
its
flight
that
they
could
faintly
hear
the
whir
of
its
wings
when
it
was
close
above
them
all
doubt
as
to
its
identity
vanished
and
besides
it
was
making
straight
in
the
direction
of
belfry
lane
without
waiting
a
moment
they
rushed
down
the
hill
their
bodies
refreshed
by
their
meal
of
none
too
well
cooked
rabbit
meat
their
courage
restored
by
the
hope
of
speedy
deliverance
for
the
city
they
found
when
they
reached
the
house
that
the
pigeon
had
been
long
before
them
vrouw
voorhaas
declaring
that
she
had
let
it
in
some
half
an
hour
previously
up
to
the
they
clambered
breathless
and
excited
to
behold
william
of
orange
strutting
about
proudly
preening
his
ruffled
feathers
and
cooing
plaintively
to
be
fed
gysbert
found
a
message
tied
about
the
bird
leg
as
fast
as
his
feet
would
carry
him
he
flew
to
the
statehouse
to
deliver
the
precious
bit
of
paper
into
the
hands
of
adrian
van
der
werf
but
jacqueline
with
a
handful
of
corn
coaxed
the
weary
messenger
to
alight
on
her
arm
when
he
had
eaten
his
fill
she
cuddled
his
head
under
her
soft
chin
and
stroked
his
brilliant
plumage
of
orange
she
crooned
thou
art
the
city
owes
much
to
thee
and
to
thy
great
namesake
a
swim
in
the
canal
and
what
came
of
it
chapter
vii
a
swim
in
the
canal
and
what
came
of
it
the
message
brought
by
the
pigeon
proved
to
be
word
direct
from
the
prince
of
orange
himself
to
the
people
of
leyden
he
implored
them
to
take
courage
and
explained
what
means
he
had
taken
to
effect
their
relief
the
plan
was
what
gysbert
had
suspected
but
was
of
even
wider
scope
not
only
had
all
the
dykes
been
ruptured
and
the
water
had
begun
to
rise
upon
the
but
also
the
prince
had
been
rapidly
collecting
provisions
in
all
the
principal
cities
and
towns
near
by
and
was
loading
them
on
a
fleet
of
vessels
ready
to
sail
across
the
land
to
leyden
when
the
flood
would
permit
thus
the
same
waters
that
were
to
rout
the
spanish
army
were
to
bear
life
and
food
to
the
suffering
city
it
was
truly
a
daring
and
original
plan
and
van
der
werf
stern
harassed
countenance
lighted
with
joy
when
he
read
the
missive
ring
the
bells
he
commanded
call
a
meeting
of
the
populace
in
the
great
square
order
the
military
bands
to
play
inspiriting
music
fire
the
cannons
and
sing
lustily
surely
this
news
must
put
heart
into
the
people
then
such
a
bedlam
of
sounds
as
rose
within
the
walls
of
leyden
not
for
months
had
there
been
such
a
stir
and
life
in
the
streets
of
the
city
the
spaniards
outside
hearing
the
revelry
and
not
in
the
least
understanding
its
cause
gazed
at
each
other
in
amazement
and
could
only
conjecture
that
a
great
army
must
be
coming
to
the
relief
of
their
foes
but
they
were
not
long
to
remain
in
doubt
that
night
a
sentinel
rushed
into
the
camp
shouting
the
water
the
water
it
stands
ten
inches
deep
all
round
the
outskirts
of
the
the
dykes
have
all
been
pierced
and
swift
consternation
seized
them
as
they
began
to
grasp
the
meaning
of
the
shouts
of
joy
within
the
walls
of
leyden
but
a
week
passed
and
the
waters
did
not
continue
to
rise
the
low
tides
and
the
constant
east
winds
were
most
unfavorable
to
the
present
flooding
of
the
land
confidence
was
restored
to
the
spanish
army
and
in
the
city
the
recent
joy
faded
away
as
suddenly
as
it
had
come
dull
distrust
reigned
unchecked
and
the
glippers
of
whom
there
were
not
a
few
in
the
town
lost
no
opportunity
to
scoff
at
mad
hopeless
scheme
of
the
prince
as
they
called
it
go
up
to
the
tower
on
hengist
hill
they
would
cry
scornfully
to
the
patriots
and
if
the
ocean
is
coming
over
the
dry
land
to
your
relief
then
it
came
to
be
that
hengist
hill
was
haunted
day
and
night
by
anxious
men
and
women
watching
hoping
trusting
praying
that
some
help
might
come
to
the
famished
city
meantime
the
weather
continued
stifling
and
unbearable
and
sickness
death
and
the
plague
raged
in
leyden
jacqueline
had
her
heart
and
hands
full
with
her
newly
assumed
duties
but
gysbert
not
having
lately
any
mission
to
execute
beyond
the
walls
found
time
hanging
rather
heavily
on
his
hands
one
muggy
oppressive
morning
he
determined
for
lack
of
anything
better
to
do
to
seek
some
secluded
spot
and
indulge
in
a
refreshing
swim
in
one
of
the
canals
reaching
a
shaded
spot
sufficiently
isolated
for
his
purpose
he
divested
himself
of
his
garments
plunged
in
and
remained
for
half
an
hour
swimming
about
idly
in
the
cool
water
at
length
concluding
that
his
bath
had
been
long
enough
he
drew
himself
out
and
was
about
to
resume
his
clothes
when
he
happened
to
glance
down
the
road
that
led
by
the
canal
about
a
hundred
yards
ahead
a
figure
whose
rear
view
struck
him
as
somewhat
familiar
was
hurrying
stealthily
along
by
st
pancras
muttered
gysbert
if
that
is
dirk
willumhoog
again
there
mischief
afoot
dropping
his
clothes
he
ran
down
the
bank
slipped
without
noise
into
the
water
and
swam
hurriedly
in
the
direction
of
the
retreating
figure
if
i
keep
behind
him
close
and
to
the
bank
thought
the
boy
i
can
watch
him
very
well
and
he
never
suspect
there
is
a
soul
around
it
did
not
take
him
long
to
catch
up
with
the
man
he
was
pursuing
most
of
the
time
he
kept
out
of
sight
but
he
rose
occasionally
far
enough
to
poke
his
head
over
the
edge
of
the
canal
and
peep
at
his
enemy
once
as
he
did
so
he
dropped
back
quickly
finding
that
dirk
had
seated
himself
under
a
tree
not
five
feet
away
the
man
was
busily
engaged
in
examining
the
writing
on
some
scraps
of
paper
or
he
would
certainly
have
seen
the
wet
tousled
head
poked
suddenly
up
over
the
bank
whew
thought
gysbert
as
he
ducked
but
that
was
a
narrow
escape
i
wonder
how
long
he
going
to
sit
mooning
there
is
right
unpleasant
hanging
here
motionless
and
in
spite
of
the
heat
the
water
grows
chilly
but
dirk
had
evidently
no
intention
of
moving
at
present
and
gysbert
was
obliged
to
shiver
and
wait
for
some
time
before
the
spirit
moved
the
man
to
be
gone
at
length
the
crunch
of
footsteps
on
the
gravel
warned
the
boy
that
his
enemy
was
once
more
on
his
way
it
was
a
relief
to
swim
again
and
limber
up
his
stiffened
body
but
to
his
astonishment
he
found
that
they
were
drawing
near
to
an
unfrequented
portion
of
the
city
near
the
walls
and
that
the
would
soon
turn
off
in
another
direction
where
he
be
going
questioned
gysbert
as
he
poked
up
his
head
at
the
turn
and
saw
dirk
advancing
straight
on
apparently
right
to
the
wall
itself
at
that
moment
the
man
half
turned
his
head
and
gysbert
ducked
under
hastily
when
he
again
raised
himself
to
his
amazement
dirk
had
disappeared
as
completely
as
though
the
earth
had
opened
up
and
swallowed
him
has
the
rascal
spread
his
cloak
and
over
the
wall
or
has
he
changed
his
bodily
substance
and
passed
right
through
it
like
the
prince
in
the
fairy
tale
demanded
gysbert
of
the
air
about
him
but
as
it
was
plain
this
would
bring
no
solution
of
the
enigma
he
cautiously
crept
toward
the
wall
determined
by
some
means
to
solve
the
mystery
from
the
turn
of
the
canal
to
the
wall
was
a
distance
of
perhaps
five
hundred
yards
an
unoccupied
space
of
ground
like
a
meadow
broken
by
nothing
save
a
little
brook
that
connected
with
the
canal
at
the
base
of
the
wall
this
brook
spread
out
for
a
space
like
a
miniature
lake
gysbert
examined
every
inch
of
the
ground
attentively
without
finding
anything
that
might
serve
to
enlighten
him
at
the
face
of
the
wall
he
stopped
plainly
no
human
being
could
scale
at
this
point
the
high
smooth
surface
that
confronted
him
dropping
on
his
knees
he
examined
the
base
nothing
here
he
muttered
and
waded
into
the
tiny
lake
that
spread
out
before
him
step
by
step
he
advanced
feeling
carefully
of
the
brick
wall
at
every
interval
to
detect
any
possible
weak
spot
when
suddenly
his
feet
slipped
into
a
deep
hole
he
was
drawn
under
and
swept
by
the
force
of
some
swift
current
through
a
small
hidden
aperture
in
the
wall
when
he
came
to
the
surface
he
grasped
at
a
projecting
ledge
and
tried
to
ascertain
what
had
happened
it
did
not
take
him
long
to
guess
the
marshy
land
in
and
about
leyden
was
constantly
intersected
by
the
formation
of
new
brooks
and
streams
not
infrequently
they
would
undermine
the
very
wall
itself
and
in
times
of
peace
these
defects
were
always
carefully
watched
and
remedied
but
in
the
terrible
strain
under
which
the
city
had
existed
for
the
past
months
this
one
had
evidently
passed
unnoticed
and
in
truth
no
one
would
have
suspected
its
presence
from
the
inside
of
the
city
so
well
was
it
hidden
by
the
little
spreading
lake
now
what
ought
i
do
next
thought
gysbert
when
he
had
unravelled
this
mystery
without
doubt
this
is
dirk
secret
doorway
and
how
he
discovered
it
the
evil
one
only
knows
the
question
is
should
i
try
to
explore
it
before
he
is
well
out
of
the
way
i
would
hardly
care
to
meet
him
in
this
black
hole
on
the
other
hand
i
do
believe
he
will
remain
in
here
a
moment
longer
than
he
has
to
and
i
freezing
hanging
here
i
risk
it
so
saying
he
plunged
into
the
grim
cave
and
commenced
his
journey
through
the
base
of
the
great
wall
of
leyden
to
his
disgust
he
found
that
the
stream
did
not
penetrate
straight
from
side
to
side
but
turned
and
pierced
through
the
of
the
wall
for
many
yards
the
way
was
difficult
enough
since
he
had
to
fight
every
inch
of
his
progress
against
the
swift
current
and
once
the
water
deepened
to
such
an
extent
that
he
was
forced
to
swim
moreover
unwarmed
by
any
sun
it
was
icy
cold
and
his
limbs
grew
numb
and
his
teeth
chattered
for
a
moment
panic
seized
him
and
he
felt
sure
he
would
never
get
out
alive
but
would
drown
in
this
horrible
place
then
his
natural
courage
again
asserted
itself
and
he
pressed
steadily
forward
at
length
the
course
of
the
hidden
stream
changed
again
a
faint
glimmer
of
daylight
appeared
and
in
another
moment
he
stood
outside
the
walls
of
leyden
protected
from
the
gaze
of
the
spanish
camp
only
by
a
few
bushes
no
dirk
willumhoog
was
to
be
seen
but
there
remained
not
a
shadow
of
doubt
that
this
was
his
mode
of
ingress
to
and
exit
from
the
city
of
leyden
gysbert
lay
down
in
the
sunlight
and
warmed
his
numbed
body
in
its
welcome
heat
in
half
an
hour
time
he
had
started
on
his
return
trip
and
found
it
twice
as
easy
as
travelling
in
the
opposite
direction
far
from
fighting
the
current
he
was
helped
along
by
it
and
in
a
short
time
stood
safe
within
the
town
again
arrived
there
another
swim
awaited
him
for
as
he
could
not
run
through
the
town
clad
in
nothing
at
all
he
was
obliged
to
take
to
the
canal
till
he
reached
the
spot
where
he
had
left
his
clothes
once
only
he
stopped
to
climb
out
and
investigate
the
place
where
dirk
had
sat
examining
his
papers
as
good
luck
would
have
it
he
discovered
hidden
away
in
the
grass
where
it
had
evidently
fallen
unnoticed
one
of
the
scraps
on
it
were
written
a
few
words
evidently
only
a
part
of
the
whole
whatever
that
might
have
been
gysbert
read
them
and
his
eyes
grew
big
with
wonder
and
then
snapped
angrily
ah
this
is
shameful
he
cried
we
see
about
this
dirk
willumhoog
thou
traitor
as
well
as
coward
with
the
paper
in
his
mouth
for
safety
he
plunged
into
the
canal
swam
to
the
point
where
he
had
left
his
clothes
flung
them
on
hastily
and
hurried
home
as
fast
as
he
could
run
i
shall
have
something
to
tell
jacqueline
about
day
work
he
remarked
to
himself
with
great
satisfaction
tranquil
amid
raging
billows
chapter
viii
tranquil
amid
raging
billows
jacqueline
was
not
at
home
when
gysbert
arrived
hot
and
breathless
she
had
been
out
all
morning
with
de
witt
on
their
usual
errand
of
mercy
and
vrouw
voorhaas
declared
with
much
sullen
complaining
that
she
could
not
be
expected
for
an
hour
yet
so
the
boy
was
compelled
to
fret
and
wander
about
idly
till
she
appeared
when
she
came
she
looked
desperately
tired
but
she
ascended
cheerfully
to
the
with
her
brother
which
place
he
chose
as
the
safest
and
most
secluded
in
which
to
impart
his
secret
i
had
the
greatest
adventure
this
morning
jacqueline
he
began
and
while
she
listened
eagerly
petting
the
smooth
head
of
her
finest
pigeon
and
coaxing
him
with
a
little
grain
gysbert
told
of
his
swim
in
the
canal
and
its
results
when
he
came
to
the
part
concerning
the
discovery
of
the
paper
he
pulled
it
from
his
pocket
and
showed
it
to
her
it
was
as
has
been
said
only
a
portion
of
the
whole
writing
and
commenced
at
the
top
with
the
completion
of
some
sentence
begun
on
another
piece
evidently
in
belfry
lane
the
prince
is
dangerously
ill
in
rotterdam
we
have
conveyed
to
him
the
report
that
leyden
has
surrendered
while
this
is
not
yet
true
the
news
will
so
discourage
him
that
it
is
doubtful
if
he
will
recover
canst
thou
imagine
anything
more
despicable
than
that
exclaimed
gysbert
our
good
prince
sickened
unto
death
by
such
reports
something
must
be
done
about
it
shall
thou
go
at
once
and
tell
mynheer
van
der
werf
inquired
his
sister
well
i
suppose
i
should
but
then
he
would
only
send
me
off
at
once
to
deny
the
rumor
so
i
may
just
as
well
not
lose
the
time
but
gysbert
what
can
that
mean
at
the
first
said
jacqueline
evidently
in
belfry
lane
can
it
possibly
refer
to
us
i
do
not
doubt
that
it
is
just
what
it
does
refer
to
he
replied
he
has
most
likely
found
out
where
we
live
he
means
mischief
i
tell
thee
not
only
to
the
country
but
to
us
also
though
what
we
have
done
to
merit
his
attention
i
can
not
imagine
thou
didst
anger
him
gysbert
that
day
at
the
gate
and
he
has
not
forgotten
but
there
is
something
else
beside
what
can
it
be
ah
i
fear
harm
is
coming
to
us
well
i
for
one
am
not
going
to
think
about
that
when
this
other
matter
is
so
much
more
important
replied
gysbert
characteristically
this
very
night
i
shall
disguise
myself
as
usual
and
make
one
more
trip
through
the
camp
as
i
must
travel
all
the
way
to
rotterdam
i
may
not
return
for
two
or
three
days
so
thou
must
explain
it
as
best
thou
canst
to
vrouw
voorhaas
i
do
not
care
much
now
what
thou
dost
tell
her
for
she
can
do
little
to
prevent
my
getting
away
if
i
choose
ah
brother
i
dread
to
have
thee
go
these
be
evil
times
and
i
have
a
foreboding
that
all
will
not
go
well
whilst
thou
art
away
and
yet
i
would
not
keep
thee
for
is
more
than
wicked
that
our
prince
should
be
so
ill
and
so
cruelly
deceived
but
thou
must
take
a
pigeon
with
thee
and
send
him
to
me
with
a
message
if
thou
art
detained
over
long
else
i
shall
break
my
heart
with
anxiety
watching
for
thee
at
dawn
next
morning
gysbert
set
forth
in
his
usual
disguise
carrying
the
pigeon
william
of
orange
at
the
bottom
of
his
bag
of
herbs
passing
out
through
the
gate
of
the
tower
of
burgundy
he
chose
a
route
through
a
part
of
the
army
near
that
of
his
first
attempt
since
that
way
lay
nearer
to
the
road
for
delft
and
rotterdam
the
usual
sleeping
camp
lay
all
about
him
the
usual
challenge
from
drowsy
sentinels
arrested
his
progress
but
thanks
to
the
magic
countersign
which
he
had
learned
from
the
gatekeeper
he
was
no
where
detained
he
accomplished
the
passage
of
the
camp
with
absolutely
no
molestation
or
exciting
incident
thinking
that
the
feat
was
becoming
very
very
easy
on
the
road
to
delft
he
looked
along
the
canal
to
see
if
he
might
spy
joris
fruytiers
and
his
bulky
craft
but
the
canal
was
deserted
and
he
was
obliged
to
make
up
his
mind
that
his
own
two
feet
must
carry
him
most
of
the
way
as
he
trudged
along
he
could
not
but
notice
the
exceeding
muddiness
of
the
road
and
the
farther
he
proceeded
the
worse
did
it
become
till
at
length
he
found
himself
plowing
through
a
veritable
bog
this
is
singular
was
his
first
thought
and
then
why
no
it
either
this
is
the
result
of
the
broken
down
dykes
how
strange
that
i
did
not
think
of
it
at
first
and
the
worse
it
became
the
more
it
pleased
him
since
it
might
mean
ultimate
relief
and
victory
to
the
city
finally
he
found
himself
wading
through
several
inches
of
water
and
he
took
infinite
boyish
delight
in
slopping
through
its
muddy
depths
splashing
the
drops
from
side
to
side
as
he
walked
in
due
time
he
reached
delft
and
stopped
to
get
a
hearty
meal
at
a
baker
shop
with
a
few
coins
he
had
in
his
pocket
thus
refreshed
and
rested
he
continued
on
his
way
darkness
at
length
overtook
him
and
abandoning
all
hope
of
reaching
rotterdam
that
night
he
crept
into
a
farmer
barn
and
in
the
hayloft
slept
the
sleep
of
healthy
weariness
till
the
first
streaks
of
dawn
tinted
the
horizon
trudging
on
his
road
again
without
either
a
breakfast
or
the
prospect
of
one
it
was
noon
before
he
reached
the
goal
of
his
desire
rotterdam
where
lay
ill
and
despairing
the
idol
of
his
boyish
dreams
william
prince
of
gysbert
had
never
been
in
rotterdam
consequently
he
was
compelled
to
inquire
his
way
frequently
ascertaining
that
the
prince
was
then
stopping
at
a
house
on
the
hoog
straat
and
being
directed
to
that
thoroughfare
he
was
not
long
in
arriving
at
his
destination
it
was
a
much
smaller
establishment
than
the
palace
of
the
in
delft
and
to
the
boy
astonishment
there
seemed
to
be
absolutely
no
one
about
the
premises
the
large
front
entrance
was
not
locked
and
having
knocked
in
vain
for
many
minutes
he
pushed
open
the
door
and
entered
nothing
greeted
him
but
deserted
halls
and
rooms
he
lingered
about
in
the
corridors
for
a
while
hoping
that
someone
might
come
in
then
his
attention
became
attracted
by
occasional
groans
and
muttered
ejaculations
from
the
room
above
fearing
that
someone
possibly
the
prince
himself
might
be
in
trouble
he
decided
to
go
up
and
see
if
he
might
render
any
assistance
he
crept
up
softly
and
guided
by
the
sounds
reached
an
open
doorway
and
peeped
in
tossing
and
moaning
on
a
bed
lay
the
gaunt
form
of
a
man
one
glance
sufficed
to
convince
gysbert
that
it
was
william
of
orange
and
that
he
was
desperately
why
the
great
head
of
his
country
should
be
thus
deserted
by
every
one
of
his
attendants
in
his
trouble
was
more
than
gysbert
could
fathom
a
natural
hesitancy
however
kept
him
from
intruding
on
the
privacy
of
the
sick
man
bedroom
and
he
stood
outside
for
a
time
watching
and
wondering
if
there
were
anything
he
might
do
the
prince
lay
in
a
huge
bed
raised
on
a
sort
of
dias
or
platform
at
his
feet
on
the
coverlet
sat
a
little
brown
and
white
spaniel
who
whined
plaintively
as
if
in
answer
to
his
master
groans
when
gysbert
appeared
in
the
doorway
the
animal
sprang
up
barking
furiously
and
tried
to
wake
his
master
but
the
prince
was
at
the
time
in
a
sort
of
stupor
and
paid
no
heed
to
the
animal
cries
the
dog
soon
perceived
that
the
intruder
attempted
no
harm
and
settled
himself
in
his
former
post
gysbert
knew
well
why
the
prince
was
attended
by
this
faithful
beast
two
years
before
at
the
siege
of
mons
he
had
been
surprised
one
night
while
asleep
in
his
tent
by
a
party
of
spaniards
who
had
planned
to
capture
him
a
little
spaniel
who
slept
in
his
quarters
sprang
up
barking
and
scratching
his
hands
the
prince
thus
wakened
found
time
to
escape
but
had
it
not
been
for
the
faithful
little
animal
the
netherlands
would
have
lost
their
strongest
protector
for
the
rest
of
his
life
the
prince
was
never
without
a
spaniel
of
the
same
breed
who
slept
nightly
in
his
room
gysbert
had
ample
time
to
note
what
manner
of
man
was
this
his
idol
his
forehead
was
high
noble
and
marked
with
many
lines
of
care
the
expression
of
his
face
even
racked
with
burning
fever
was
of
a
tender
strong
and
fatherly
benignity
near
by
lay
his
armor
and
sword
on
the
hilt
of
which
was
carved
in
latin
his
chosen
motto
sævis
tranquillus
in
undis
tranquil
amid
raging
billows
no
language
could
have
better
expressed
the
quiet
firmness
and
unshaken
courage
of
this
wonderful
nobleman
even
in
the
most
harrowing
and
adverse
circumstances
the
sick
man
was
gradually
emerging
from
unconsciousness
his
eyes
opened
widely
but
unseeingly
and
he
muttered
in
a
ah
leyden
leyden
would
god
that
i
might
help
thee
it
is
not
true
it
can
not
be
true
that
thou
hast
yielded
to
the
enemy
ah
my
country
what
fate
is
now
before
thee
and
i
so
helpless
to
render
thee
aid
tranquil
tranquil
i
must
be
tranquil
amid
the
billows
oh
thou
my
god
help
me
again
unconsciousness
overcame
him
and
he
sank
into
another
stupor
gysbert
heart
ached
with
pity
and
the
wild
desire
to
tell
him
that
his
fears
were
groundless
when
he
next
wakes
thought
the
boy
i
will
go
in
and
tell
him
how
false
is
this
report
he
has
heard
presently
the
prince
exhibited
signs
of
returning
consciousness
but
he
seemed
weaker
and
could
only
murmur
leyden
leyden
tranquil
then
gysbert
with
trembling
knees
and
quaking
heart
entered
the
door
and
walked
up
to
the
bed
at
first
the
prince
did
not
see
him
but
soon
the
renewed
barking
of
his
spaniel
attracted
his
attention
to
the
curious
little
figure
standing
by
the
bedside
who
art
thou
he
queried
feebly
mynheer
prince
faltered
gysbert
i
am
only
a
boy
from
leyden
but
i
have
come
to
tell
you
that
it
is
not
true
what
you
have
been
told
concerning
the
city
surrender
leyden
still
holds
out
and
will
so
continue
till
its
last
defender
is
slain
the
dullness
of
fever
in
the
sick
man
eyes
gave
place
to
an
actual
sparkle
leyden
still
safe
he
exclaimed
then
have
i
surely
been
deceived
oh
god
be
praised
that
he
has
answered
my
prayer
but
tell
me
brave
little
fellow
how
camest
thou
to
know
what
only
one
of
my
confidential
servants
has
whispered
to
me
and
how
camest
thou
all
this
way
to
undeceive
me
methinks
too
thou
hast
assumed
something
of
a
disguise
then
gysbert
told
him
the
circumstances
of
the
finding
of
the
paper
and
much
about
dirk
willumhoog
from
this
the
prince
beguiled
him
into
telling
about
how
he
had
made
expeditions
with
messages
through
the
spanish
army
and
how
his
sister
was
helping
care
for
the
sick
and
in
leyden
and
many
details
about
the
condition
of
the
city
when
he
had
finished
he
was
emboldened
to
ask
the
prince
how
it
was
that
the
house
had
no
attendants
especially
when
he
lay
so
truly
it
must
seem
strange
answered
william
the
silent
i
have
the
kindest
of
servants
and
the
best
medical
attendance
but
it
so
happens
that
i
have
sent
all
off
this
morning
on
errands
of
the
greatest
importance
when
this
traitor
this
joachim
hansleer
returns
i
will
discharge
him
straightway
for
a
lying
villain
who
thinks
to
kill
me
by
his
deception
he
has
been
whispering
to
me
this
past
week
that
leyden
had
surrendered
but
that
the
rest
were
afraid
to
tell
me
if
the
great
prince
would
forgive
me
for
saying
it
replied
gysbert
i
would
suggest
that
he
be
locked
up
in
close
confinement
instead
else
he
will
join
his
companion
dirk
willumhoog
and
plot
more
wickedness
true
true
exclaimed
the
prince
laughing
for
the
first
time
in
weeks
thou
art
a
clever
lad
to
have
thought
of
it
and
now
tell
me
thy
name
i
shall
not
forget
thee
when
gysbert
had
told
him
he
held
out
his
hand
take
these
ten
florins
and
buy
thyself
all
the
food
thou
canst
carry
back
with
thee
be
sure
to
tell
van
der
werf
to
guard
that
opening
in
the
wall
well
and
arrest
dirk
willumhoog
if
he
enters
again
tell
him
also
that
help
is
very
near
and
pray
god
for
a
west
wind
my
grateful
thanks
go
with
thee
already
i
feel
the
fever
abated
and
new
life
surging
through
me
farewell
gysbert
knelt
to
kiss
the
hand
of
his
hero
and
then
sped
away
light
of
heel
and
glad
of
heart
at
the
successful
outcome
of
his
errand
and
when
a
few
moments
later
the
of
holland
cornelius
van
meirop
ascended
to
the
to
visit
his
prince
he
marvelled
at
the
great
change
for
the
better
that
had
suddenly
taken
place
in
the
condition
of
william
the
silent
vrouw
voorhaas
secret
chapter
ix
vrouw
voorhaas
secret
no
sooner
had
gysbert
been
dispatched
on
his
journey
to
rotterdam
than
jacqueline
turned
her
attention
to
preparing
breakfast
much
to
her
astonishment
vrouw
voorhaas
was
not
yet
up
and
about
but
she
concluded
that
the
woman
was
wearied
out
with
hard
work
and
anxiety
and
was
taking
an
extra
involuntary
nap
the
most
careful
search
in
the
larder
revealed
nothing
that
under
ordinary
circumstances
would
be
considered
in
the
least
palatable
jacqueline
remembered
two
pigeons
eggs
that
had
been
laid
the
day
before
and
determined
that
they
must
go
toward
furnishing
the
these
with
some
very
thin
gruel
of
pigeon
grain
completed
the
arrangements
wondering
that
vrouw
voorhaas
had
not
yet
appeared
and
fearing
lest
something
were
the
matter
she
decided
to
go
up
and
investigate
the
cause
of
this
unusual
state
of
affairs
at
the
door
of
the
bedroom
she
paused
at
the
sound
of
a
curious
muttering
and
groaning
now
grown
terribly
familiar
to
her
ears
then
she
opened
the
door
her
worst
suspicions
were
verified
vrouw
voorhaas
had
the
plague
the
woman
lay
tossing
and
moaning
utterly
unconscious
of
anything
about
her
muttering
strange
incoherent
sentences
in
her
delirium
amazed
and
shocked
at
what
she
heard
jacqueline
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
listening
i
will
not
eat
it
i
must
not
eat
it
cried
the
unconscious
woman
it
is
for
the
children
oh
god
how
i
hunger
then
in
a
lower
tone
dirk
willumhoog
thou
shalt
harm
them
as
thou
didst
endeavor
to
harm
here
she
appeared
to
fall
into
a
restless
sleep
and
for
a
few
moments
her
tossing
form
lay
quiet
jacqueline
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
and
wept
with
sheer
bitterness
and
despair
oh
vrouw
voorhaas
vrouw
voorhaas
now
i
know
what
doth
ail
thee
she
sobbed
aloud
thou
hast
starved
thyself
for
our
sakes
thou
didst
deceive
us
into
thinking
thou
wast
satisfied
with
a
little
and
now
thou
art
reaping
the
results
of
thy
sacrifice
the
realization
that
this
faithful
servant
had
brought
herself
to
this
pass
by
her
own
occupied
jacqueline
mind
to
the
exclusion
of
every
other
thought
how
wicked
and
ungrateful
i
have
been
she
blamed
herself
going
out
to
nurse
other
people
when
starvation
and
illness
lay
waiting
right
at
my
own
door
and
i
never
guessed
oh
if
gysbert
were
only
here
then
the
necessity
for
doing
something
and
that
speedily
forced
itself
upon
her
deciding
that
she
could
leave
the
sick
woman
more
easily
now
than
later
she
ran
out
at
once
to
find
de
witt
he
accompanied
her
without
an
instant
delay
when
he
reached
the
sick
room
he
gave
one
keen
glance
at
his
patient
and
then
set
about
his
work
of
relief
jacqueline
assisting
him
with
the
intelligence
and
skill
perfected
by
much
practice
now
said
he
finally
thou
must
make
up
thy
mind
juffrouw
jacqueline
to
one
thing
for
the
present
thou
must
give
up
all
thought
of
going
on
thy
daily
round
with
me
and
devote
thyself
to
the
care
of
this
thy
companion
her
case
is
more
critical
than
usual
having
been
brought
on
i
judge
by
systematic
starvation
but
jan
faltered
the
girl
he
is
still
very
weak
and
needs
my
care
let
him
come
here
and
stay
ordered
the
doctor
i
will
myself
fetch
him
this
afternoon
and
thus
thou
wilt
have
both
thy
patients
under
thine
eye
he
also
may
be
able
to
help
thee
a
little
where
is
thy
brother
he
has
gone
out
of
the
city
on
an
errand
of
importance
i
do
not
expect
him
back
for
two
or
three
days
she
answered
well
keep
him
out
of
the
sick
room
when
he
returns
is
best
for
him
not
to
be
exposed
to
the
disease
now
i
must
be
going
on
my
usual
way
i
shall
miss
thy
helpful
presence
much
juffrouw
jacqueline
ah
but
times
are
sore
in
this
wretched
city
as
he
turned
to
go
vrouw
voorhaas
roused
herself
and
began
muttering
anew
louvain
louvain
yes
from
there
we
came
but
what
is
that
to
thee
the
doctor
started
and
walked
back
toward
his
patient
she
hath
been
raving
much
without
sense
remarked
jacqueline
hastily
i
fear
her
mind
is
all
unhinged
but
de
witt
continued
to
scrutinize
sharply
the
features
of
the
sick
woman
didst
thou
really
come
from
louvain
he
asked
jacqueline
at
length
yes
faltered
the
girl
many
years
ago
what
is
the
name
of
this
woman
the
doctor
continued
to
question
as
jacqueline
told
him
a
great
light
appeared
to
break
in
on
his
mind
ah
ah
he
exclaimed
i
see
it
all
it
is
as
clear
as
day
to
me
now
that
resemblance
in
thee
i
was
sure
i
should
place
sometime
is
not
thy
name
cornellisen
and
was
not
thy
father
the
famous
in
the
university
aye
answered
jacqueline
in
fear
and
trembling
thou
hast
guessed
aright
but
tell
no
one
i
pray
thee
i
knew
it
i
felt
it
continued
the
doctor
and
yet
i
could
not
make
the
memory
a
connected
one
till
now
i
was
a
student
about
to
graduate
from
the
university
and
thy
father
was
my
great
admiration
and
example
i
saw
vrouw
voorhaas
once
on
visiting
his
home
but
never
his
children
hence
i
did
not
recognize
thee
it
was
sad
sad
thy
father
end
and
i
grieved
over
it
many
a
long
day
it
was
his
great
devotion
to
the
young
count
de
buren
who
was
under
his
special
care
that
brought
him
to
his
death
dost
thou
know
all
about
it
i
know
only
what
vrouw
voorhaas
has
told
me
of
his
being
captured
and
killed
by
the
cruel
duke
of
alva
answered
jacqueline
then
i
can
tell
thee
more
and
i
will
some
time
right
glad
i
am
that
it
has
fallen
to
my
lot
to
help
and
befriend
thee
for
so
i
can
render
service
to
thy
dead
father
who
was
always
more
than
kind
to
me
all
the
morning
jacqueline
sat
by
the
sick
woman
bedside
moistening
her
parched
lips
with
water
cooling
her
feverish
brow
with
refreshing
compresses
and
tending
to
every
unspoken
want
with
a
devotion
born
of
love
and
remorse
at
no
time
did
vrouw
voorhaas
become
sane
and
conscious
of
her
surroundings
and
her
feverish
delirium
increased
as
the
day
wore
on
it
wrung
the
girl
tender
heart
to
hear
her
cry
out
against
the
pangs
of
hunger
and
imagine
that
she
must
continually
deny
herself
for
the
children
sake
little
by
little
the
history
of
all
the
past
weeks
of
suffering
was
revealed
to
the
watching
girl
and
she
realized
that
what
she
had
supposed
to
be
a
sufficient
supply
of
provisions
for
all
had
only
been
rendered
enough
for
herself
and
gysbert
by
the
cruel
deprivation
of
this
faithful
woman
but
other
chance
ejaculations
were
more
mystifying
and
served
to
arouse
in
jacqueline
an
intense
terrified
curiosity
as
to
what
might
be
this
long
kept
secret
that
so
troubled
the
soul
of
vrouw
voorhaas
once
she
was
electrified
by
hearing
the
sick
woman
hiss
how
didst
thou
get
in
the
city
dirk
willumhoog
no
go
away
thou
canst
draw

their

jacqueline
puzzled
over
it
in
trembling
astonishment
was
it
possible
that
dirk
willumhoog
had
been
here
in
belfry
lane
and
interviewed
vrouw
voorhaas
while
they
were
away
somewhere
but
why
had
she
not
told
them
of
it
what
could
be
this
dreadful
mystery
that
the
two
seemed
to
share
in
common
what
harm
did
he
plan
to
do
them
that
afternoon
jan
arrived
accompanied
by
de
witt
jacqueline
now
had
her
hands
full
with
the
two
patients
but
she
was
grateful
for
the
companionship
of
the
old
man
it
had
seemed
unutterably
depressing
to
be
shut
up
alone
with
this
sick
woman
who
was
never
for
a
moment
in
her
right
mind
and
who
raved
incessantly
about
disturbing
mysteries
two
more
days
passed
and
the
conditions
in
belfry
lane
continued
about
the
same
vrouw
voorhaas
did
not
improve
except
that
she
had
less
delirium
and
jacqueline
was
worried
almost
out
of
her
senses
because
gysbert
had
not
yet
appeared
nothing
could
convince
her
that
all
was
well
with
him
and
she
kept
constant
watch
for
the
carrier
pigeon
to
bring
some
news
running
up
to
the
cote
on
the
fourth
day
she
found
to
her
joy
william
of
orange
strutting
about
among
the
two
or
three
other
birds
a
note
was
fastened
about
his
leg
and
jacqueline
unfastened
it
with
trembling
eager
fingers
to
her
surprise
it
was
addressed
not
to
her
but
to
vrouw
voorhaas
and
was
in
a
strange
handwriting
with
a
great
throb
of
terror
she
opened
it
and
read
these
words
vrouw

fortune
has
at
last
turned
in
my
favor
the
boy
is
now
in

juffrouw
jacqueline
remarked
pieter
de
witt
as
he
left
the
bedside
of
the
sick
woman
she
is
really
coming
out
of
this
illness
very
well
thanks
to
thy
careful
nursing
and
our
good
jan
assistance
is
it
so
indeed
answered
jacqueline
listlessly
striving
to
force
herself
to
some
show
of
enthusiasm
then
am
i
right
glad
for
i
have
done
my
best
and
thou
hast
been
devotion
itself
de
witt
oh
if
only
she
turned
away
her
head
to
hide
the
tears
that
would
come
and
a
sob
stopped
her
further
utterance
the
good
doctor
understood
and
busied
himself
over
his
patient
till
the
girl
had
regained
her
if
i
mistake
not
he
ventured
at
length
she
will
probably
be
quite
herself
having
regained
consciousness
several
times
lately
it
would
be
well
should
she
recover
sufficiently
to
ask
after
thy
brother
not
to
allow
her
to
think
he
has
come
to
harm
a
shock
like
that
would
thrust
her
lower
than
she
has
yet
been
but
what
shall
we
say
faltered
jacqueline
i
must
not
tell
an
untruth
wouldst
thou
tell
her
the
broad
brutal
facts
and
thereby
cause
her
death
demanded
the
doctor
sternly
nay
it
is
only
necessary
to
say
that
since
she
had
been
suffering
with
the
plague
it
was
deemed
wisest
to
send
him
away
for
a
time
lest
he
contract
the
disease
she
will
be
satisfied
with
that
for
the
present
jacqueline
acquiesced
in
this
and
the
two
went
downstairs
to
acquaint
jan
van
buskirk
with
the
news
of
the
improvement
in
vrouw
voorhaas
condition
jan
was
sitting
in
the
sunny
immaculate
kitchen
reading
his
big
bible
one
of
the
few
possessions
he
had
brought
with
him
to
belfry
lane
he
was
as
pleased
as
the
others
with
the
good
report
listen
to
this
he
remarked
i
just
been
reading
it
in
the
good
book
i
think
the
lord
must
have
had
the
siege
of
leyden
in
mind
when
he
caused
this
to
be
written
he
shall
deliver
thee
from
the
snare
of
the
fowler
and
from
the
noisome
pestilence
is
that
just
what
happened
to
vrouw
voorhaas
and
myself
i
call
it
nothing
less
than
miraculous
and
here
some
more
shalt
not
be
afraid
for
the
terror
by
night
nor
for
the
arrow
that
flieth
by
day
does
that
just
describe
the
spanish
army
out
beyond
for
the
pestilence
that
walketh
in
darkness
that
the
plague
for
the
destruction
that
wasteth
at
noonday
that
starvation
thousand
shall
fall
at
thy
side
and
ten
thousand
at
thy
right
hand
but
it
shall
not
come
nigh
thee
have
more
than
five
thousand
died
of
starvation
and
the
pestilence
here
already
and
we
are
yet
spared
true
true
murmured
jacqueline
but
gysbert
now
there
was
an
unspoken
but
conspiracy
between
the
doctor
and
jan
to
keep
up
the
spirits
of
the
despairing
girl
on
this
painful
subject
thou
didst
not
let
me
read
far
enough
jacqueline
the
old
man
hastened
to
add
only
listen
here
is
another
psalm
that
i
was
reading
this
morning
it
should
be
a
great
help
to
thee
lord
is
my
light
and
my
salvation
whom
shall
i
fear
the
lord
is
the
strength
of
my
life
of
whom
shall
i
be
afraid
the
wicked
even
mine
enemies
came
upon
me
to
eat
up
my
flesh
they
stumbled
and
fell
though
an
host
should
encamp
against
me
my
heart
shall
not
fear
though
war
should
rise
against
me
in
this
will
i
be
confident
me
thy
way
o
lord
and
lead
me
in
a
plain
path
because
of
mine
enemies
wait
on
the
lord
be
of
good
courage
and
he
shall
strengthen
thine
heart
wait
i
say
on
the
lord
what
thou
hast
read
does
truly
give
me
new
courage
said
jacqueline
thanks
jan
thou
art
indeed
a
help
and
a
comfort
and
now
i
will
go
up
to
the
to
see
if
perchance
a
pigeon
has
come
with
some
message
for
the
burgomaster
a
week
had
passed
since
the
disappearance
of
the
boy
and
not
a
sign
or
a
token
had
come
to
the
anxious
watchers
in
belfry
lane
to
indicate
his
whereabouts
or
his
fate
after
the
first
shock
caused
by
dirk
message
jacqueline
had
gone
straight
to
adrian
van
der
werf
and
explained
the
situation
imploring
him
to
assist
in
trying
to
find
and
rescue
her
brother
the
burgomaster
was
deeply
distressed
at
the
misfortune
that
had
come
to
his
little
jumper
and
was
much
mystified
as
to
the
cause
of
this
continued
persecution
of
two
innocent
children
by
an
unknown
man
but
as
to
offering
any
assistance
that
he
told
jacqueline
was
quite
beyond
his
power
already
concern
for
the
famishing
besieged
city
and
despair
at
its
vanishing
hopes
of
relief
had
driven
him
almost
beyond
his
senses
with
anxiety
it
was
now
not
only
impossible
but
would
be
also
quite
fruitless
for
him
to
send
men
outside
the
walls
to
search
for
gysbert
as
they
would
probably
be
killed
on
sight
by
the
ferocious
spaniards
he
advised
jacqueline
to
wait
quietly
for
further
developments
and
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
gysbert
had
not
been
killed
but
was
probably
being
kept
alive
for
some
yet
unknown
purpose
but
little
encouraged
by
this
interview
jacqueline
crept
home
to
endure
silent
but
unending
misery
for
she
was
too
proud
to
be
seen
by
the
others
constantly
grieving
and
moreover
she
blamed
herself
bitterly
for
ever
allowing
her
brother
to
undertake
such
a
hazardous
enterprise
ascending
to
the
that
morning
she
found
a
returned
messenger
strutting
about
among
the
remaining
birds
he
bore
a
note
wrapped
round
his
leg
addressed
to
adrian
van
der
werf
jacqueline
made
all
haste
to
carry
this
to
the
statehouse
for
it
now
devolved
upon
her
to
be
the
bearer
of
these
messages
when
they
arrived
the
burgomaster
welcomed
her
kindly
juffrouw
jacqueline
hast
heard
any
news
from
thy
brother
yet
nay
answered
the
girl
shaking
her
head
sadly
but
i
have
here
another
message
for
you
mynheer
van
der
werf
it
has
but
just
come
by
a
pigeon
thanks
thanks
he
said
opening
it
eagerly
then
with
sparkling
eyes
he
cried
ah
this
is
excellent
excellent
news
admiral
boisot
with
his
fleet
manned
by
the
beggars
of
the
sea
has
arrived
out
of
zeeland
and
is
already
entering
the
rhine
over
the
broken
dykes
he
can
not
be
ten
miles
from
the
city
praise
god
praise
god
he
turned
to
jacqueline
for
an
answering
enthusiasm
but
found
to
his
surprise
that
the
poor
girl
had
fainted
away
in
the
chair
where
she
sat
evidently
from
sheer
hunger
and
fatigue
van
der
werf
hastened
to
a
closet
took
out
a
bottle
and
forced
some
cordial
between
her
set
teeth
as
he
chafed
her
cold
hands
he
murmured
poor
poor
little
girl
thou
hast
borne
thy
share
of
this
cursed
trouble
nobly
and
well
that
i
know
from
de
witt
himself
thou
shalt
have
every
comfort
and
help
that
i
can
render
thee
jacqueline
soon
returned
to
consciousness
but
the
burgomaster
would
not
yet
allow
her
to
leave
and
insisted
that
she
drink
another
glass
of
the
revivifying
cordial
when
she
was
quite
herself
again
he
sent
her
back
to
belfry
lane
with
a
large
basket
of
food
from
his
own
larder
which
he
had
despatched
a
soldier
to
procure
it
is
not
much
he
apologized
for
we
are
hard
put
to
it
ourselves
for
sustenance
now
but
it
is
at
least
something
i
can
do
for
so
faithful
a
helper
see
that
thou
dost
not
stint
in
thy
distribution
of
it
he
ended
laughing
when
she
had
gone
van
der
werf
hastened
to
despatch
a
to
spread
the
good
news
and
himself
made
all
speed
to
hengist
hill
to
observe
the
position
of
the
fleet
the
day
was
clear
and
the
flotilla
lay
in
plain
sight
not
far
beyond
the
a
motley
array
of
more
than
two
hundred
vessels
of
every
conceivable
shape
and
size
the
largest
an
enormous
craft
with
bulwarks
and
moved
by
huge
paddle
wheels
turned
by
a
crank
was
called
the
of
it
served
as
the
for
admiral
boisot
and
was
renowned
for
being
the
leader
in
every
battle
each
ship
carried
from
eight
to
ten
cannon
and
the
whole
fleet
was
manned
by
hundred
wild
and
veterans
the
bravest
and
fiercest
in
the
land
they
called
themselves
the
beggars
of
the
sea
a
name
they
had
assumed
since
a
time
at
first
when
the
scornful
spanish
soldiery
had
mocked
them
who
is
afraid
of
you
you
are
nothing
but
a
pack
of
scoffed
the
spaniards
very
well
replied
the
zeelanders
ye
shall
see
how
can
and
truly
they
made
a
ferocious
crew
as
the
spanish
found
later
to
their
surprise
and
dismay
they
neither
gave
nor
took
quarter
for
theirs
was
a
battle
to
the
death
and
woe
to
the
luckless
spaniard
who
fell
within
their
power
long
live
the
beggars
was
their
rallying
cry
and
long
live
the
beggars
now
echoed
in
shout
upon
shout
from
hengist
hill
by
the
crowds
that
had
followed
the
burgomaster
to
the
summit
hope
was
once
more
restored
and
leyden
gathered
herself
together
and
drew
a
long
breath
of
renewed
courage
but
before
the
consummation
of
this
hope
there
was
much
to
be
done
and
many
battles
to
fight
the
lay
before
the
fleet
guarded
by
spanish
troops
and
all
about
the
villages
and
fortresses
were
in
the
hands
of
the
same
enemy
on
the
night
of
september
tenth
the
city
was
startled
by
loud
cannonading
to
the
southwest
and
the
sky
grew
lurid
with
the
flames
of
burning
farmhouses
and
villages
boisot
had
made
the
first
bold
move
finding
that
the
great
dyke
was
but
insufficiently
guarded
he
attacked
it
in
the
dead
of
night
at
the
same
time
setting
fire
to
and
ruining
several
adjacent
strongholds
of
the
enemy
when
morning
dawned
he
was
in
possession
of
the
coveted
without
the
loss
of
a
single
man
the
discomfited
spaniards
had
but
too
late
discovered
their
mistake
in
underestimating
the
courage
of
their
assailants
a
dove
flew
in
on
the
morning
of
the
eleventh
sent
by
boisot
telling
of
the
victory
jacqueline
carried
it
to
the
statehouse
with
the
first
feeling
of
enthusiasm
she
had
experienced
in
many
a
long
day
perhaps
the
city
really
would
be
relieved
and
perhaps
gysbert
might
be
restored
to
them
after
all
jacqueline
responds

chapter
xi
jacqueline
responds
to
an
urgent
summons
since
the
great
dyke
had
been
pierced
an
entire
week
had
elapsed
admiral
boisot
had
expected
to
find
the
the
only
barrier
between
his
fleet
and
the
city
but
no
sooner
had
this
been
passed
than
he
discovered
to
his
surprise
and
disgust
that
several
more
dykes
and
fortresses
stood
between
himself
and
the
goal
of
a
mile
farther
on
was
the
another
long
dyke
rising
a
foot
above
the
water
but
the
spaniards
had
not
yet
sufficiently
learned
their
lesson
and
this
barrier
also
was
very
scantily
guarded
with
his
usual
promptness
and
audacity
boisot
carried
this
situation
set
his
men
to
levelling
the
dyke
and
the
fleet
passed
through
triumphantly
but
again
he
was
doomed
to
disappointment
beyond
the
stretched
a
large
shallow
lake
called
freshwater
mere
through
which
there
was
but
one
passage
a
deep
canal
as
fortune
would
have
it
however
this
canal
led
directly
under
a
bridge
that
was
in
possession
of
the
spaniards
this
time
the
enemy
had
looked
well
to
its
defences
and
a
few
skirmishes
soon
convinced
boisot
that
the
foe
had
the
advantage
of
him
so
he
prudently
drew
off
and
waited
only
two
and
a
half
miles
from
the
beleaguered
city
lay
the
rescuing
fleet
stranded
in
shallow
water
unable
to
progress
an
inch
the
east
wind
blew
steadily
the
waters
decreased
and
the
spaniards
laughed
in
their
faces
within
the
city
reigned
a
despair
all
the
blacker
for
the
brief
illumination
of
hope
that
had
now
died
but
god
had
not
yet
forsaken
the
cause
of
the
right
on
the
eighteenth
of
september
the
wind
changed
a
great
gale
raged
for
three
days
out
of
the
northwest
the
waters
rose
rapidly
and
the
vessels
were
again
afloat
fortunately
too
from
some
fugitives
from
one
of
the
villages
who
had
come
aboard
boisot
learned
of
another
course
he
could
pursue
a
little
roundabout
indeed
but
having
the
advantage
of
avoiding
the
terrible
guarded
bridge
he
lost
no
time
in
availing
himself
of
this
and
the
amazed
spaniards
at
the
village
of
nord
aa
suddenly
beheld
this
flotilla
bearing
down
upon
them
from
an
entirely
unexpected
direction
they
fled
precipitately
not
even
stopping
to
gather
up
their
possessions
to
the
strongly
fortified
village
of
zoeterwoude
only
a
mile
and
from
the
city
a
little
beyond
nord
aa
boisot
encountered
the
last
dyke
the
this
he
promptly
levelled
but
the
wind
had
again
changed
the
water
fell
to
the
depth
of
only
nine
inches
and
the
fleet
lay
once
more
helpless
in
its
shallows
day
by
day
passed
and
nothing
occurred
to
alter
the
monotony
of
this
inaction
but
one
circumstance
took
place
which
filled
the
sea
beggars
with
renewed
courage
and
inspired
universal
joy
the
prince
of
orange
now
recovered
sufficiently
from
his
long
illness
to
be
about
came
on
board
the
of
to
grasp
the
hand
of
the
doughty
admiral
from
thence
he
made
a
triumphal
tour
of
all
the
vessels
instilling
into
every
heart
fresh
courage
cheering
advising
and
directing
he
looked
pale
and
worn
after
his
illness
and
his
devoted
veterans
even
these
fierce
sea
beggars
were
ready
to
fall
at
his
feet
and
obey
his
lightest
command
after
a
long
and
serious
conference
with
boisot
he
returned
to
delft
meanwhile
what
of
jacqueline
upon
the
messages
borne
by
whose
carrier
pigeons
the
whole
city
hung
with
breathless
expectation
since
the
passing
of
the
she
had
continued
to
carry
constant
messages
to
van
der
werf
for
every
time
the
admiral
gained
a
new
advantage
he
hastened
to
despatch
another
pigeon
for
the
encouragement
of
leyden
everyone
who
was
not
too
weak
with
hunger
to
walk
haunted
the
summit
of
hengist
hill
to
watch
the
advance
of
the
rescuers
it
filled
their
hearts
with
new
courage
to
note
how
small
a
space
the
besieging
army
was
now
forced
to
occupy
only
a
ring
little
more
than
a
mile
wide
all
about
the
city
with
the
threatening
ocean
and
a
crew
of
desperate
sea
beggars
on
one
side
and
the
populace
of
leyden
in
the
center
the
situation
was
certainly
becoming
a
trifle
embarrassing
for
the
spanish
army
jacqueline
occasionally
went
to
hengist
hill
with
jan
who
was
now
able
to
get
about
quite
briskly
de
witt
insisted
that
she
must
get
out
and
take
fresh
air
and
exercise
and
he
was
always
willing
to
sit
with
vrouw
voorhaas
while
she
was
away
they
never
allowed
the
girl
to
go
far
alone
for
all
yet
feared
the
threat
of
dirk
willumhoog
to
entrap
her
as
well
as
her
brother
and
took
care
that
she
was
well
guarded
vrouw
voorhaas
had
also
made
decided
improvement
but
was
yet
unable
to
leave
her
bed
the
excessive
weakness
caused
by
her
long
and
its
consequences
seemed
almost
impossible
to
overcome
her
constant
inquiries
about
gysbert
too
were
becoming
more
and
more
difficult
to
answer
though
they
still
kept
up
the
fiction
that
he
was
quartered
with
de
witt
during
her
illness
sometimes
it
seemed
as
though
she
watched
them
all
with
hidden
suspicion
and
once
she
even
murmured
i
fear
he
is
not
safe
something
tells
me
he
is
in
danger
on
the
night
when
the
fleet
reached
nord
aa
a
pigeon
flew
in
bearing
the
tidings
jacqueline
found
him
for
she
was
constantly
on
the
watch
for
messages
but
since
it
was
nearly
nine
it
was
deemed
best
that
jan
should
carry
the
word
to
the
burgomaster
the
doctor
had
just
left
not
five
minutes
before
and
jan
hobbled
off
to
execute
his
mission
leaving
jacqueline
with
vrouw
voorhaas
the
girl
sat
reading
by
the
sick
bed
casting
an
occasional
glance
at
her
patient
who
was
sound
asleep
presently
thinking
she
heard
a
knock
at
the
door
she
closed
her
book
and
hurried
downstairs
is
early
for
jan
to
be
back
she
thought
he
has
but
just
left
and
i
know
he
will
want
to
stay
and
chat
awhile
with
mynheer
van
der
werf
who
can
it
be
some
indefinable
sensation
of
misgiving
caused
her
to
be
a
little
long
about
opening
the
door
she
was
reassured
however
by
seeing
only
a
small
boy
who
thrust
a
note
into
her
hand
and
turning
ran
down
the
street
she
called
to
him
to
come
back
as
there
might
be
an
answer
required
but
the
child
apparently
did
not
hear
her
and
was
soon
out
of
sight
wonderingly
she
brought
the
scrap
of
paper
to
the
and
read
its
contents
juffrouw
jacqueline
it
ran
if
thou
wouldst
hear
news
of
thy
brother
and
dost
also
desire
a
chance
to
rescue
him
i
beg
thee
to
come
to
the
end
of
the
wirtemstrasse
at
once
do
not
waste
a
moment
for
the
opportunity
is
but
brief
the
messenger
there
can
only
wait
fifteen
minutes
thy
brother
sends
his
love
one
who
is
thy
friend
jacqueline
flushed
with
joy
and
then
turned
deathly
pale
hope
doubt
and
distrust
reigned
equally
in
her
mind
news
of
gysbert
a
chance
to
rescue
him
she
would
go
to
the
end
of
the
world
for
that
but
why
had
not
the
writer
of
the
note
signed
his
name
why
had
the
little
boy
who
brought
it
run
away
so
quickly
oh
if
jan
or
de
witt
were
only
here
to
advise
her
oh
if
there
were
but
more
time
she
glanced
at
the
note
again
it
said
come
immediately
the
messenger
has
but
fifteen
minutes
to
wait
fifteen
minutes
had
gone
already
while
it
would
take
at
least
ten
to
reach
the
appointed
spot
only
four
minutes
in
which
to
decide
but
she
had
been
forbidden
to
go
out
alone
especially
at
night
that
she
concluded
would
not
interfere
if
they
knew
that
gysbert
welfare
hung
upon
it
the
girl
was
on
a
positive
rack
of
torturing
doubt
but
the
note
again
conquered
thy
brother
sends
his
love
gysbert
was
then
at
least
alive
and
safe
and
was
thinking
of
her
one
who
is
thy
friend
surely
no
one
who
wished
her
evil
could
subscribe
that
signature
if
it
were
a
she
need
fear
no
harm
then
and
there
she
formed
her
determination
to
risk
all
and
obey
this
summons
god
would
surely
watch
over
her
catching
up
a
light
wrap
she
opened
and
closed
the
door
softly
and
sped
down
the
dark
street
the
night
was
starless
and
chilly
the
few
people
she
met
were
hurrying
in
the
opposite
direction
to
witness
the
conflagration
at
nord
aa
from
hengist
hill
her
way
lay
in
the
direction
of
the
city
wall
between
the
cow
gate
and
the
tower
of
burgundy
it
was
a
deserted
section
and
approaching
it
she
recognized
it
as
the
scene
of
gysbert
adventure
in
the
canal
a
shudder
of
apprehension
shook
her
but
she
hurried
on
it
was
do
or
die
now
and
nothing
could
have
induced
her
to
turn
back
reaching
the
end
of
the
wirtemstrasse
she
found
herself
at
the
bend
of
the
canal
described
by
gysbert
a
meadow
stretched
out
before
her
and
beyond
that
rose
a
section
of
the
grim
wall
of
leyden
there
was
not
a
soul
in
sight
and
the
girl
began
to
think
that
in
some
way
she
had
been
deceived
concluding
however
that
she
might
possibly
be
a
little
ahead
of
time
she
leaned
over
the
rail
of
the
stone
bridge
that
crossed
the
canal
and
waited
illustration
dirk
willumhoog
seizes
jacqueline
suddenly
without
a
warning
sound
she
felt
herself
seized
from
behind
before
she
could
even
cry
out
a
bandage
was
clapped
over
her
mouth
and
fastened
at
the
back
of
her
head
instantly
another
was
bound
over
her
eyes
and
her
hands
were
tied
behind
her
in
spite
of
her
desperate
struggles
in
all
this
time
she
had
not
caught
one
glimpse
of
her
captor
but
she
heard
a
rough
voice
mutter
ah
i
have
thee
at
last
i
have
waited
long
enough
for
a
chance
to
find
thee
unguarded
by
those
two
watchdogs
and
she
knew
it
to
be
the
voice
of
dirk
willumhoog
now
walk
with
me
and
do
exactly
as
i
tell
thee
if
thou
dost
not
wish
to
be
knocked
in
the
head
the
voice
commanded
in
a
low
key
in
utter
despair
jacqueline
was
forced
to
obey
there
being
obviously
no
other
course
to
pursue
the
man
grasped
her
by
one
arm
and
pulled
her
along
after
him
she
could
tell
by
the
feeling
of
the
ground
that
they
were
crossing
the
meadow
and
anticipating
what
was
to
come
she
trembled
till
her
knees
almost
refused
to
support
her
presently
she
stepped
up
to
her
ankles
in
a
pool
of
water
draw
a
long
breath
and
hold
it
commanded
the
voice
she
tried
to
do
as
she
was
told
when
with
a
sudden
plunge
she
was
immersed
head
and
all
for
what
seemed
an
interminable
length
of
time
at
last
she
felt
her
head
raised
above
the
surface
keep
it
up
so
was
the
order
the
icy
current
more
than
once
forced
her
from
her
feet
causing
her
to
slip
under
and
the
atmosphere
of
the
place
struck
a
chill
to
her
very
marrow
once
again
the
ground
gave
way
beneath
her
and
she
felt
the
man
strong
arm
pulling
her
after
him
while
he
swam
in
water
too
deep
for
wading
but
the
girl
senses
could
no
longer
stand
the
strain
of
cold
fatigue
and
terror
and
at
this
point
she
suddenly
became
unconscious
how
the
rest
of
the
journey
was
accomplished
she
could
never
imagine
for
she
knew
no
more
till
she
came
to
herself
in
what
seemed
to
be
some
sort
of
narrow
hallway
a
door
was
opened
and
she
was
rudely
thrust
inside
with
the
exclamation
there
at
length
i
thought
i
should
never
get
thee
here
then
the
door
was
slammed
to
and
loudly
bolted
reunited
chapter
xii
reunited
for
a
time
jacqueline
sat
huddled
and
motionless
in
the
corner
where
she
had
fallen
her
eyes
were
still
bandaged
her
mouth
was
gagged
and
her
hands
were
tied
behind
her
she
wondered
vaguely
whether
they
would
ever
come
to
release
her
from
these
bonds
and
she
shivered
pitifully
in
her
wet
garments
finally
she
roused
herself
and
struggled
feebly
to
free
her
hands
her
surprise
was
great
when
she
found
that
the
cords
fell
apart
easily
but
it
was
not
till
later
that
she
guessed
the
secret
they
had
probably
been
severed
nearly
through
before
she
was
pushed
into
the
room
once
her
hands
were
free
it
was
the
work
of
but
a
few
seconds
to
unbind
her
eyes
and
mouth
and
look
about
her
the
room
was
in
inky
darkness
save
where
a
small
window
admitted
a
faint
gray
light
that
indicated
the
outer
world
there
was
no
sound
anywhere
through
the
house
oh
if
they
had
only
allowed
her
a
little
light
it
was
weird
and
uncanny
to
be
thus
thrust
into
a
strange
room
and
left
there
in
utter
darkness
presently
the
chill
of
her
dripping
clothes
caused
her
to
shudder
and
give
an
involuntary
moan
a
moment
after
she
was
electrified
by
hearing
move
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
there
was
then
some
living
thing
in
here
with
her
a
chill
not
of
cold
this
time
but
of
sheer
terror
shook
her
from
head
to
foot
and
a
wild
desire
to
shriek
aloud
possessed
her
again
the
dreaded
something
moved
breathed
hard
and
uttered
the
word
jacqueline
with
a
cry
of
joy
and
recognition
she
sprang
across
the
room
and
brother
and
sister
found
themselves
tightly
clasped
in
each
others
arms
for
a
moment
neither
of
them
could
do
anything
but
sob
and
laugh
and
kiss
the
other
distractedly
at
last
they
grew
sufficiently
calm
for
speech
oh
gysbert
my
brother
art
thou
truly
unharmed
and
well
how
did
this
dreadful
thing
happen
breathed
jacqueline
yes
i
am
alive
and
whole
he
replied
but
how
i
got
here
is
a
long
story
which
i
will
tell
thee
later
but
what
about
thee
jacqueline
thou
art
soaking
wet
how
didst
thou
come
to
be
caught
in
the
same
trap
in
rapid
sentences
she
sketched
the
history
of
the
adventures
the
scoundrel
exclaimed
gysbert
he
must
have
brought
thee
through
that
same
hole
in
the
wall
i
felt
sure
he
had
been
planning
to
capture
thee
but
when
thou
wert
thrown
so
violently
into
the
room
i
could
not
tell
whether
it
was
thyself
or
some
new
trap
he
had
been
setting
for
me
not
till
i
heard
thee
moan
was
i
sure
he
has
some
scheme
in
getting
possession
of
us
two
but
what
it
is
i
can
not
imagine
however
thou
must
get
rid
of
these
wet
things
sister
there
is
a
little
room
adjoining
this
where
thou
canst
sleep
it
has
evidently
been
arranged
for
that
purpose
take
off
thy
dripping
clothes
and
wrap
thyself
in
the
and
we
will
then
tell
each
other
all
that
has
happened
since
we
parted
now
said
gysbert
when
his
sister
had
arrayed
herself
in
the
warm
i
will
begin
by
telling
thee
all
about
my
journey
to
rotterdam
and
he
rehearsed
to
her
all
the
details
of
his
interview
with
the
prince
of
orange
and
continued
it
took
me
another
day
and
night
to
pass
delft
and
reach
the
spanish
outposts
feeling
so
certain
i
should
get
through
in
safety
i
think
i
grew
a
little
reckless
and
determined
to
try
the
route
i
had
taken
the
first
time
i
never
made
a
bigger
mistake
in
the
first
place
i
had
an
idea
of
the
password
having
been
away
three
days
as
luck
would
have
it
i
failed
to
encounter
my
friend
alonzo
de
rova
but
did
meet
right
face
to
face
with
the
same
captain
who
had
arrested
me
before
he
made
short
work
of
laying
hands
on
me
and
delivered
me
over
to
the
charge
of
about
six
or
eight
soldiers
in
a
big
tent
i
tried
again
my
scheme
of
drawing
pictures
and
they
all
became
very
much
interested
hanging
over
me
with
laughter
and
much
admiration
as
i
drew
the
portrait
of
each
one
i
was
hoping
alonzo
would
happen
along
but
he
did
i
can
not
tell
how
my
plan
would
have
worked
nor
whether
the
soldiers
would
have
released
me
for
just
as
i
was
finishing
the
last
one
i
happened
to
look
up
and
there
was
the
evil
face
of
dirk
willumhoog
in
the
door
of
the
tent
staring
down
at
me
i
thought
perhaps
he
would
not
recognize
me
in
my
disguise
but
he
did
somehow
disappearing
for
a
moment
he
came
back
with
the
captain
and
pointed
to
me
saying
is
the
boy
i
want
and
i
been
hunting
for
him
all
over
he
is
no
glipper
at
all
but
a
spy
and
a
very
dangerous
character
give
him
to
me
and
i
see
that
he
is
properly
taken
care
of
i
saw
by
this
that
resistance
would
be
useless
so
i
very
meekly
followed
him
out
of
the
tent
once
outside
he
blindfolded
my
eyes
tied
my
hands
and
led
me
what
seemed
a
long
distance
at
last
we
entered
this
house
upstairs
we
climbed
and
inside
this
room
he
uncovered
my
eyes
see
if
thou
art
a
glipper
he
said
and
proceeded
to
wash
off
all
the
stain
we
will
pay
off
some
old
scores
of
long
standing
he
added
and
with
a
heavy
switch
he
gave
me
such
a
beating
as
i
never
had
in
my
life
before
he
beat
exclaimed
the
girl
her
eyes
blazing
in
the
dark
oh
i
could
kill
him
for
it
yes
but
i
did
not
cry
out
replied
gysbert
proudly
not
one
moan
did
he
hear
from
me
till
at
last
he
stopped
from
sheer
weariness
to
pay
for
thy
kind
remarks
on
the
day
i
left
leyden
he
said
will
settle
the
rest
later
then
he
took
my
bag
and
examined
it
wondering
at
the
herbs
and
finding
the
food
and
pigeon
hast
thou
here
he
asked
why
wast
thou
outside
the
walls
i
told
him
we
were
hungry
and
i
had
been
trying
to
get
some
food
by
selling
herbs
liest
he
shouted
was
this
carrier
pigeon
for
i
tell
thee
thou
earnest
messages
to
the
enemy
i
said
i
had
taken
it
so
that
in
case
i
could
not
get
back
in
time
i
could
send
a
message
send
the
message
he
replied
it
will
be
somewhat
differently
worded
thou
canst
wager
what
was
it
jacqueline
the
girl
told
him
and
both
together
puzzled
over
the
supposition
that
dirk
and
vrouw
voorhaas
must
sometime
have
met
and
held
some
secret
knowledge
in
common
she
also
told
him
what
the
woman
had
uttered
in
her
delirium
but
they
could
make
nothing
of
the
mystery
then
gysbert
went
on
with
his
story
after
that
he
left
me
bolting
the
door
behind
him
and
i
was
free
to
look
about
me
and
see
where
i
was
as
far
as
my
limited
space
would
permit
i
found
myself
in
this
room
which
thou
wilt
see
at
daylight
with
the
other
small
one
opening
from
it
both
contained
a
bed
and
that
made
me
guess
that
at
some
time
he
hoped
to
capture
thee
also
there
are
two
little
windows
well
guarded
by
heavy
iron
bars
like
a
prison
however
i
could
see
enough
through
them
to
guess
where
i
was
this
is
a
little
lonely
farmhouse
well
outside
the
village
of
zoeterwoude
thou
knowest
where
that
is
jacqueline
we
have
often
gone
there
to
buy
pigeons
it
is
about
a
mile
and
a
half
from
leyden
the
walls
and
floorings
of
the
rooms
are
thick
and
i
seldom
hear
any
sounds
from
the
rest
of
the
house
there
is
no
fireplace
and
very
little
furniture
well
here
i
was
and
likely
to
remain
till
fortune
again
turned
in
my
favor
for
three
successive
days
dirk
came
up
and
gave
me
a
beating
till
i
foresaw
that
this
was
to
become
a
daily
practice
otherwise
i
had
food
enough
shoved
in
the
door
at
me
more
than
i
had
in
leyden
and
nothing
on
earth
to
do
at
length
i
became
thoroughly
weary
of
the
beating
performance
and
hit
upon
a
scheme
to
avoid
it
and
what
dost
thou
think
that
was
jacqueline
i
can
not
guess
she
answered
why
i
pretended
i
had
the
he
cried
gleefully
oh
jacqueline
thou
canst
not
guess
what
a
desperate
coward
that
dirk
willumhoog
is
one
day
when
i
heard
him
coming
i
held
my
breath
till
i
was
scarlet
in
the
face
like
fever
i
lay
covered
up
in
bed
and
when
he
entered
i
began
to
toss
my
arms
about
and
rave
as
though
light
in
the
head
he
did
not
beat
me
that
time
but
stared
at
me
uneasily
for
a
while
and
went
out
muttering
he
did
not
come
in
again
that
day
and
i
had
a
chance
to
make
myself
a
little
worse
i
found
a
place
in
the
wall
where
some
loose
plaster
had
fallen
away
from
the
brick
lining
within
breaking
off
some
of
this
brick
powdering
and
moistening
it
i
thus
obtained
some
fine
red
paint
with
which
i
proceeded
to
decorate
myself
with
the
pail
of
water
for
a
mirror
all
over
my
face
and
hands
i
imitated
the
blotches
that
appear
on
the
oh
i
must
have
been
a
fine
healthful
sight
when
dirk
came
in
to
visit
me
next
morning
he
looked
gave
one
howl
and
rushed
out
of
the
room
i
have
not
seen
him
since
and
i
know
he
believes
me
far
gone
in
this
illness
strange
to
say
though
in
spite
of
his
hatred
he
does
not
seem
to
wish
me
to
die
but
has
caused
to
be
thrust
in
the
door
the
finest
food
and
nourishment
that
could
be
procured
i
could
live
like
a
lord
if
i
wished
but
i
scarcely
touch
it
saving
only
enough
to
keep
life
in
me
else
he
would
surely
suspect
thus
have
i
passed
the
three
weeks
he
ceased
to
speak
and
for
a
while
they
sat
silent
hoping
doubting
fearing
for
the
future
yet
rejoicing
that
they
were
at
last
together
but
now
thou
must
go
to
bed
jacqueline
said
gysbert
at
length
thou
art
wearied
out
and
sleep
will
do
thee
good
obediently
she
crept
into
the
bed
in
the
little
room
dropped
asleep
almost
as
soon
as
her
head
touched
the
pillow
and
never
woke
till
the
sun
was
streaming
in
at
the
small
window
high
overhead
rising
and
donning
the
clothes
that
were
now
dry
she
hurried
into
the
next
room
to
get
the
first
glimpse
at
her
brother
he
was
indeed
a
remarkable
sight
as
he
lay
in
bed
exhibiting
his
horribly
blotched
face
and
hands
it
would
have
taken
a
keen
eye
so
cleverly
had
he
executed
this
dreadful
decoration
to
detect
it
as
false
thou
must
pretend
to
be
greatly
alarmed
about
me
jacqueline
should
they
interview
thee
and
do
not
be
surprised
at
my
ravings
for
they
are
right
gysbert
had
hardly
uttered
this
caution
when
there
was
a
sound
of
steps
approaching
the
door
immediately
he
began
to
toss
his
arms
about
moan
mutter
and
occasionally
shriek
in
a
muffled
manner
go
away
go
away
from
me
he
raved
thou
art
not
my
sister
why
dost
thou
say
thou
art
jacqueline
i
do
not
know
thee
thou
art
someone
sent
by
that
enemy
of
ours
go
away
go
away
i
tell
thee
then
the
door
was
unbolted
a
basket
of
food
was
thrust
within
and
a
voice
was
heard
calling
above
the
racket
of
gysbert
pretended
delirium
juffrouw
jacqueline
is
thy
brother
very
ill
yes
answered
the
girl
trembling
he
is
so
sorely
ill
that
i
fear
he
will
die
well
thou
must
not
let
him
die
thou
must
nurse
him
carefully
we
do
not
wish
either
of
you
to
come
to
harm
why
dost
thou
keep
us
here
demanded
jacqueline
growing
bolder
let
us
go
away
where
he
can
get
a
doctor
and
proper
treatment
is
not
for
thee
to
inquire
why
thou
art
here
that
thou
shalt
perhaps
know
in
due
time
answered
the
voice
as
for
a
doctor
it
is
impossible
to
procure
one
and
inadvisable
to
bring
him
here
if
we
could
thou
knowest
much
about
nursing
the
plague
and
hast
had
rare
experience
in
the
city
if
thou
dost
need
any
special
food
or
medicine
for
him
we
will
try
to
procure
it
but
otherwise
all
must
remain
as
it
is
dost
think
this
case
is
very
contagious
ah
very
replied
jacqueline
slyly
even
the
odor
from
the
room
is
enough
to
infect
one
especially
if
one
fears
it
greatly
at
this
the
door
was
slammed
hastily
shut
and
when
the
children
had
heard
the
last
departing
footsteps
of
dirk
willumhoog
die
away
they
could
not
in
spite
of
their
danger
repress
a
giggle
of
uncontrollable
mirth

chapter
xiii
adrian
van
der
werf
words
can
not
express
the
astonishment
of
jan
van
buskirk
when
he
returned
from
the
burgomaster
to
find
no
jacqueline
in
the
little
house
in
belfry
lane
unfortunately
she
had
still
grasped
the
crumpled
note
in
her
hand
when
she
left
the
house
so
he
had
absolutely
no
clew
to
her
whereabouts
the
only
explanation
he
could
offer
to
himself
was
that
she
must
have
gone
out
unpremeditatedly
to
obtain
some
fresh
medicine
at
a
little
chemist
shop
near
by
so
he
sat
down
to
wait
for
her
return
but
the
time
passed
on
and
still
she
did
not
come
an
hour
rolled
by
and
vrouw
voorhaas
awoke
to
ask
for
jacqueline
jan
quieted
her
by
telling
her
that
the
girl
had
retired
to
take
a
little
rest
and
vrouw
voorhaas
went
to
sleep
again
another
hour
passed
and
jan
frightened
almost
out
of
his
senses
resolved
to
seek
de
witt
waking
vrouw
voorhaas
he
told
her
that
he
did
not
feel
well
and
was
going
out
to
consult
the
doctor
she
he
said
must
go
quietly
to
sleep
again
as
it
was
nothing
serious
unsuspectingly
she
assented
and
he
hurried
out
to
find
de
witt
weary
with
his
day
exertion
just
about
to
turn
into
bed
the
tale
was
soon
told
and
pieter
de
witt
lost
not
a
moment
in
resuming
his
clothes
she
has
answered
some
summons
said
he
and
has
been
led
into
a
trap
i
know
it
i
have
suspected
all
along
that
something
like
this
would
happen
when
we
least
dreamed
of
it
my
god
it
is
unthinkable
from
end
to
end
the
two
searched
the
city
that
night
no
one
had
heard
of
her
none
had
seen
her
and
they
returned
home
in
the
gray
of
early
morning
despairing
and
heartsick
it
will
kill
vrouw
voorhaas
said
de
witt
and
by
this
time
she
must
certainly
know
something
is
wrong
since
both
you
and
the
girl
have
been
away
all
night
come
right
for
me
jan
if
it
is
necessary
but
i
must
turn
in
now
for
just
a
few
moment
rest
or
i
break
down
too
poor
jan
crept
home
broken
and
almost
in
tears
at
the
door
he
was
met
by
vrouw
voorhaas
who
had
dragged
herself
out
of
bed
to
search
the
house
for
its
usual
inmates
her
eyes
were
wild
and
haggard
and
she
faced
him
fiercely
where
hast
thou
been
all
night
where
are
jacqueline
and
gysbert
she
demanded
oh
they
are
all
right
all
safe
he
tried
to
prevaricate
but
his
face
betrayed
him
it
is
not
so
thou
liest
she
interrupted
him
evil
has
come
to
them
i
know
it
i
know
it
for
many
days
have
i
suspected
that
all
was
not
well
with
gysbert
and
now
jacqueline
has
disappeared
too
thou
canst
not
deceive
me
do
not
try
ah
dirk
willumhoog
thou
she
could
not
finish
but
fell
unconscious
at
the
feet
of
jan
he
tried
to
raise
her
but
in
his
own
weakened
condition
found
it
impossible
and
concluded
that
the
best
thing
to
do
was
to
go
back
at
once
for
the
doctor
pieter
de
witt
exhausted
but
indefatigable
still
in
the
cause
of
his
friends
hurried
back
with
him
at
once
together
they
succeeded
in
raising
her
and
getting
her
back
to
bed
but
they
failed
utterly
in
restoring
her
to
consciousness
de
witt
shook
his
head
many
times
over
the
black
prospect
this
shock
has
caused
a
sudden
relapse
and
no
wonder
he
said
i
sadly
fear
that
the
end
is
not
now
far
away
thou
wilt
have
to
be
her
attendant
now
for
the
sake
of
the
children
do
thy
best
and
i
will
help
thee
there
is
one
more
possibility
that
we
have
not
tried
said
we
did
not
go
to
the
burgomaster
can
it
be
possible
that
another
message
came
while
i
was
returning
and
she
hurried
out
with
it
going
some
other
way
perchance
as
it
was
late
mynheer
van
der
werf
wife
would
not
allow
her
to
go
home
and
has
kept
her
till
morning
perchance
she
has
been
taken
sick
there
it
is
a
small
chance
jan
a
very
small
one
said
de
witt
they
would
surely
have
sent
us
word
in
any
case
but
go
to
him
if
it
will
set
thy
heart
at
rest
i
will
stay
with
vrouw
voorhaas
the
while
jan
set
out
once
more
his
poor
old
legs
fairly
tottering
under
him
with
loss
of
sleep
lack
of
food
and
weakness
but
excitement
still
buoyed
him
up
and
the
faint
vague
hope
that
jacqueline
might
have
passed
the
night
with
mevrouw
van
der
werf
spurred
him
on
to
one
more
effort
it
was
yet
too
early
to
find
the
burgomaster
at
the
statehouse
so
he
proceeded
straight
to
the
residence
in
the
werfsteg
he
was
obliged
to
lift
the
heavy
knocker
several
times
before
he
could
arouse
the
sleepy
servants
within
at
length
he
was
admitted
by
a
yawning
hastily
clad
domestic
who
went
to
call
the
burgomaster
van
der
werf
came
down
quickly
expecting
another
message
from
outside
the
city
his
face
was
pale
haggard
and
careworn
and
his
eyes
showed
plainly
that
he
had
passed
a
sleepless
night
jan
he
cried
what
news
hast
thou
is
there
another
message
then
seeing
the
old
man
wild
questioning
eyes
ah
what
ails
thee
has
anything
dreadful
happened
is
she
not
here
is
she
not
here
muttered
jan
sinking
limply
into
a
chair
is
who
not
here
questioned
van
der
werf
mystified
jacqueline
the
juffrouw
jacqueline
juffrouw
jacqueline
has
not
been
here
for
three
days
why
jan
what
has
happened
then
the
old
man
told
the
story
while
van
der
werf
listened
with
darkening
face
is
passing
strange
is
fairly
devillish
he
vociferated
i
could
feel
no
worse
if
harm
had
come
to
one
of
my
own
family
nay
i
know
nothing
about
her
and
what
is
worse
i
can
do
nothing
i
am
as
helpless
as
thou
art
my
hands
are
tied
thou
sayest
thou
hast
searched
the
city
even
i
can
do
no
more
if
she
has
by
any
means
been
taken
beyond
the
walls
god
help
her
the
two
men
sat
for
some
moments
gloomily
silent
jan
had
reached
a
point
of
exhaustion
where
his
body
absolutely
refused
to
obey
the
behests
of
his
mind
when
he
attempted
to
take
his
departure
he
could
not
rise
from
his
chair
thou
must
stay
and
have
a
little
food
and
drink
such
poor
stuff
as
i
can
offer
thee
said
the
burgomaster
seeing
his
plight
and
he
rang
for
a
servant
to
bring
in
such
fare
as
they
had
in
the
house
jan
had
no
heart
to
attack
the
breakfast
but
van
der
werf
insisted
that
he
should
eat
a
little
to
sustain
his
strength
so
he
made
a
brave
attempt
while
the
burgomaster
strode
restlessly
up
and
down
the
room
jan
jan
he
cried
at
length
the
lord
hath
put
more
on
my
shoulders
than
mortal
man
can
bear
dost
thou
know
it
is
by
my
will
alone
that
this
city
holds
out
daily
i
receive
the
most
cajoling
and
notes
from
commander
valdez
he
makes
the
most
extravagant
promises
of
mercy
and
leniency
if
i
will
only
open
the
gates
is
but
a
song
as
everyone
well
knows
yet
the
dissatisfied
ones
are
clamorous
to
try
once
more
the
mercy
of
the
spaniard
they
accuse
me
of
starving
and
killing
them
for
a
mere
question
of
my
personal
pride
my
god
has
not
one
of
my
own
family
already
died
of
the
plague
is
not
my
own
wife
even
now
desperately
ill
am
the
gainer
by
my
policy
alas
no
jan
a
dead
body
was
found
placed
against
my
door
yesterday
morning
we
all
know
what
that
means
they
lay
the
city
terrible
plight
to
my
stubbornness
but
while
i
live
i
swear
i
will
not
open
the
gates
when
jan
somewhat
refreshed
had
finished
his
meal
and
rose
to
start
for
home
van
der
werf
offered
to
accompany
him
a
way
saying
he
wanted
no
breakfast
himself
and
must
be
at
the
statehouse
early
together
they
went
out
the
burgomaster
supporting
the
old
man
feeble
steps
as
tenderly
as
a
son
might
have
assisted
his
father
not
many
rods
behind
them
two
or
three
malcontents
for
having
always
leaned
toward
the
opinions
of
the
glippers
began
to
follow
the
magistrate
muttering
remarks
of
no
very
pleasant
nature
jan
the
fiery
turned
about
once
and
rebuked
them
hold
thy
tongue
janus
de
vries
and
thou
pieter
brouwer
hast
thou
not
thyself
been
fed
from
the
burgomaster
own
kitchen
i
know
all
about
thee
who
art
thou
to
utter
complaint
do
not
pay
any
more
attention
to
them
jan
lest
they
begin
to
be
wordy
and
attract
more
attention
to
themselves
and
us
than
is
desirable
said
van
der
werf
but
a
crowd
had
already
begun
to
gather
which
in
an
incredibly
short
time
grew
into
a
mob
shouting
yelling
gesticulating
fiercely
demanding
bread
and
the
opening
of
the
gates
the
burgomaster
began
to
fear
not
for
his
own
life
but
for
that
of
the
feeble
old
man
who
would
be
so
helpless
in
their
hands
did
they
come
at
last
to
violence
just
at
this
crisis
they
emerged
into
the
triangular
space
in
front
of
the
old
church
of
pancras
deeming
the
time
ripe
for
him
to
exert
all
his
powers
of
persuasion
on
this
threatening
throng
van
der
werf
ascended
the
steps
of
the
edifice
placed
jan
in
a
protecting
angle
of
the
doorway
and
turned
about
to
face
the
crowd
as
he
removed
his
great
felt
hat
the
morning
sunlight
fell
through
the
surrounding
on
a
face
calm
imposing
and
softened
with
a
great
and
overwhelming
sadness
its
silent
appeal
touched
even
the
hearts
of
the
famishing
mob
and
when
he
raised
his
hand
there
was
instant
silence
then
after
a
moment
he
spoke
in
words
that
history
has
forever
made
memorable
what
would
ye
my
friends
why
do
ye
murmur
that
we
do
not
break
our
vows
and
surrender
to
the
spaniards
that
would
be
a
fate
more
horrible
than
what
the
city
now
endures
i
tell
you
i
have
made
an
oath
to
hold
the
city
and
may
god
give
me
strength
to
keep
that
oath
i
can
die
but
once
whether
by
your
hands
or
the
enemy
or
the
hand
of
god
my
own
fate
is
indifferent
to
me
but
not
so
that
of
the
city
which
has
been
entrusted
to
my
care
i
know
that
we
shall
starve
if
we
are
not
soon
relieved
but
starvation
is
preferable
to
a
dishonored
death
is
it
not
your
threats
move
me
not
my
life
is
at
your
disposal
here
is
my
sword
plunge
it
into
my
breast
if
ye
will
take
my
body
to
appease
your
hunger
but
do
not
expect
me
to
surrender
while
i
live
he
held
out
his
arms
a
moment
then
dropped
them
at
his
side
instantly
a
great
shout
of
approval
went
up
from
the
multitude
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
the
threats
were
changed
to
cries
of
encouragement
to
the
city
and
defiance
to
the
enemy
transmuted
by
the
persistent
dogged
courage
of
one
man
standing
absolutely
alone
long
live

van

they
shouted
we
will
indeed
fight
to
the
end
and
leaving
the
two
standing
on
the
steps
of
pancras
the
crowd
rushed
to
the
walls
where
they
remained
all
day
hurling
renewed
defiance
at
the
spaniards
when
the
mob
had
deserted
them
van
der
werf
escorted
jan
to
belfry
lane
and
left
him
at
the
door
after
which
he
proceeded
with
firmer
step
and
easier
mind
to
his
daily
duties
at
the
statehouse
but
when
jan
reached
vrouw
voorhaas
room
he
sat
suddenly
down
in
a
chair
and
looked
hard
at
the
doctor
who
noticed
that
the
old
man
expression
was
as
exalted
as
though
he
had
seen
some
heavenly
vision
what
is
the
matter
he
asked
hast
thou
found
juffrouw
jacqueline
nay
answered
jan
i
have
not
found
her
but
pieter
de
witt
i
have
just
beheld
the
finest
act
of
courage
that
it
was
ever
the
lot
of
one
poor
man
to
witness
if
adrian
van
der
werf
can
thus
bear
the
sorrows
of
a
whole
city
on
his
heart
thou
and
i
through
god
must
not
shrink
at
the
burdens
his
wisdom
has
seen
fit
to
lay
upon
us
and
he
told
the
doctor
of
his
morning
experience
alonzo
de
rova
is
as
good
as
his
word
chapter
xiv
alonzo
de
rova
is
as
good
as
his
word
meanwhile
jacqueline
and
gysbert
isolated
in
the
upper
room
of
the
little
farmhouse
in
zoeterwoude
found
themselves
with
a
great
deal
of
time
on
their
hands
and
liberty
to
do
pretty
much
as
they
liked
within
their
limited
space
the
fiction
of
gysbert
illness
with
the
plague
was
rigorously
adhered
to
and
beyond
opening
the
door
a
crack
to
poke
in
the
food
dirk
willumhoog
never
ventured
to
intrude
every
day
he
would
shout
through
the
closed
door
to
jacqueline
inquiring
about
gysbert
condition
generally
she
would
reply
that
he
was
no
better
or
that
the
symptoms
were
very
much
worse
very
infrequently
she
answered
that
he
was
a
little
better
they
lived
on
the
best
of
fare
for
dirk
was
evidently
anxious
that
the
patient
should
have
every
opportunity
in
that
way
to
improve
gysbert
now
ate
even
more
than
his
share
but
jacqueline
was
of
course
supposed
to
have
consumed
the
larger
amount
on
the
whole
though
they
felt
that
the
deception
could
not
be
sustained
very
much
longer
without
discovery
from
the
barred
windows
they
watched
constantly
endeavoring
to
discover
in
that
way
if
possible
something
that
was
going
on
there
was
little
life
about
the
farmhouse
though
they
occasionally
saw
a
few
spanish
soldiers
go
in
and
out
and
a
woman
sometimes
moving
about
the
yard
only
once
they
overheard
a
conversation
that
threw
some
light
on
whose
house
they
were
inhabiting
a
soldier
entered
the
yard
one
day
and
was
accosted
by
this
woman
who
seemed
to
belong
to
the
place
hast
thou
heard
any
news
of
my
husband
she
questioned
nothing
certain
vrouw
hansleer
he
replied
but
there
is
a
rumor
that
the
prince
has
discovered
him
and
had
him
cast
into
prison
then
the
two
passed
out
of
hearing
but
gysbert
snapped
his
fingers
delightedly
and
cried
is
it
now
i
know
where
we
are
jacqueline
the
prince
told
me
that
the
name
of
the
wretch
who
was
deceiving
him
was
joachim
hansleer
dost
thou
not
remember
and
it
is
due
to
me
that
he
has
been
imprisoned
how
much
dost
thou
suppose
our
lives
would
be
worth
if
dirk
willumhoog
and
vrouw
hansleer
knew
that
long
live
the
prince
and
may
he
keep
our
secret
but
one
day
when
gysbert
was
looking
from
the
window
he
was
startled
by
the
sight
of
a
figure
that
had
something
familiar
in
its
aspect
it
was
a
man
in
the
uniform
of
a
spanish
soldier
who
was
tall
and
finely
built
but
his
face
could
not
be
seen
by
the
boy
presently
however
he
looked
up
and
gysbert
recognized
in
an
instant
the
features
of
alonzo
de
rova
immediately
a
plan
formed
itself
in
his
mind
jacqueline
he
whispered
it
is
a
big
risk
but
i
going
to
take
the
chance
he
to
help
me
if
ever
i
needed
it
now
we
will
see
the
yard
is
deserted
and
i
will
try
to
attract
his
attention
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
he
gave
a
low
whistle
and
the
soldier
looked
up
seeing
this
strange
horribly
spotted
face
at
the
window
he
uttered
a
startled
exclamation
by
lawrence
what
dost
thou
want
with
me
art
thou
the
boy
dirk
willumhoog
is
keeping
for
some
unknown
purpose
yes
answered
gysbert
in
a
low
tone
dost
thou
not
remember
the
little
glipper
lad
who
drew
thy
portrait
by
the
pope
i
do
replied
alonzo
surely
thou
art
not
he
i
am
said
gysbert
wilt
thou
help
me
if
so
ask
to
come
up
and
see
me
but
thou
hast
the
plague
answered
the
soldier
for
reply
gysbert
shook
his
head
and
significantly
rubbed
off
one
of
the
spots
alonzo
gave
a
loud
guffaw
of
appreciation
at
the
joke
and
nodded
encouragingly
wait
he
motioned
with
his
lips
for
someone
was
coming
out
of
the
house
not
long
after
the
children
heard
a
great
commotion
on
the
stairs
immediately
gysbert
leaped
into
bed
covered
himself
well
and
began
to
moan
and
rave
incoherently
while
jacqueline
trembled
lest
their
secret
should
now
be
discovered
through
her
brother
rashness
nearer
and
nearer
came
the
sounds
as
of
remonstrance
and
scuffling
combined
i
tell
thee
i
will
see
them
dirk
it
will
do
no
harm
and
thou
sayest
the
lass
is
pretty
i
wager
five
florins
she
is
not
so
fair
as
my
sweetheart
in
madrid
dost
thou
take
the
wager
nay
but
thou
wilt
catch
the
plague
thou
canst
not
wish
to
risk
that
the
boy
is
a
terrible
sight
and
the
very
odor
of
the
room
will
infect
thee
zounds
man
how
careful
thou
art
of
my
health
but
fortunately
i
do
not
fear
the
plague
i
had
it
three
years
ago
and
got
over
it
bravely
they
say
one
is
then
exempt
and
can
never
catch
it
again
let
me
go
dirk
aye
but
i
will
not
answer
for
the
consequences
thou
reckless
man
answered
dirk
as
he
reluctantly
unbolted
the
door
shutting
it
again
quickly
when
the
soldier
was
once
inside
alonzo
sat
down
on
a
vacant
chair
and
laughed
till
the
tears
rolled
down
his
cheeks
at
the
capers
gysbert
cut
raving
and
tossing
shouting
and
groaning
and
flinging
the
about
thou
art
the
cleverest
lad
i
ever
met
he
whispered
glancing
significantly
at
the
door
to
intimate
that
dirk
was
probably
outside
listening
then
aloud
by
the
pope
thou
art
in
a
right
bad
predicament
and
methinks
thou
hast
not
much
longer
to
survive
my
lively
boy
and
thy
sister
is
truly
as
handsome
as
dirk
painted
her
but
i
like
the
dark
beauty
of
my
inez
best
here
someone
called
dirk
loudly
and
they
heard
him
descending
the
stairs
knowing
however
that
his
absence
would
probably
not
be
for
long
they
made
the
best
use
of
their
time
de
rova
hurriedly
whispered
gysbert
we
are
caught
here
like
rats
in
a
trap
canst
thou
help
us
to
escape
willingly
would
i
answered
the
soldier
for
i
have
not
forgotten
the
splendid
portrait
of
me
which
i
sent
to
madrid
i
do
truly
think
it
has
at
last
turned
the
undecided
heart
of
fair
inez
montagno
toward
me
for
her
letters
of
late
have
been
warmer
and
less
flouting
also
i
bear
no
particular
love
to
dirk
willumhoog
who
has
done
me
one
or
two
sneaking
ill
turns
that
he
thinks
i
do
not
trace
to
him
but
how
can
i
aid
thee
i
can
not
unlock
doors
so
carefully
guarded
i
can
not
waft
thee
from
barred
windows
nor
can
i
rescue
thee
with
ladders
what
wilt
thou
only
one
thing
said
gysbert
quickly
hast
thou
a
knife
about
thee
if
so
leave
it
with
me
i
pray
no
seeing
the
soldier
questioning
glance
i
do
not
mean
to
kill
anyone
with
it
but
with
something
sharp
in
our
possession
i
think
we
can
furnish
our
own
means
of
escape
for
an
answer
the
spaniard
drew
from
his
belt
a
weapon
with
a
strong
toledo
blade
and
placed
it
in
the
boy
hands
quickly
concealing
it
under
his
mattress
gysbert
thanked
him
with
an
eloquent
look
but
footsteps
were
again
approaching
and
all
knew
that
the
interview
must
soon
end
alonzo
turned
to
jacqueline
with
a
look
of
reverent
admiration
in
his
eyes
fair
young
juffrouw
beyond
everything
do
i
admire
thy
quiet
courage
and
devotion
to
thy
brother
for
the
sake
of
my
lady
donna
inez
montagno
whom
i
shall
one
day
tell
all
about
thee
may
i
kiss
thy
hand
in
farewell
jacqueline
genuinely
touched
extended
her
hand
de
rova
dropped
gallantly
on
one
knee
and
touched
it
with
his
lips
i
would
that
i
could
do
more
for
thee
he
whispered
but
i
have
done
all
that
is
in
my
power
god
bless
you
both
and
grant
you
success
a
knock
was
heard
at
the
door
gysbert
began
to
rave
again
and
alonzo
prepared
to
take
his
departure
they
are
hard
put
to
it
the
children
heard
him
telling
dirk
as
he
went
out
i
doubt
whether
the
boy
will
recover
and
he
is
not
in
his
senses
a
minute
but
i
have
won
my
wager
dirk
i
consider
donna
inez
far
handsomer
than
thy
little
juffrouw
jacqueline
in
there
but
is
he
not
a
jewel
whispered
gysbert
i
told
thee
i
had
made
a
friend
when
i
cultivated
his
acquaintance
this
pretty
little
blade
is
going
to
save
us
i
hope
and
he
stroked
the
weapon
admiringly
but
how
demanded
jacqueline
in
wonder
trust
me
and
thou
wilt
see
was
all
he
would
reply
the
eavesdroppers
and
the
plot
chapter
xv
the
eavesdroppers
and
the
plot
gysbert
did
not
keep
his
sister
long
in
doubt
as
to
the
use
he
proposed
to
make
of
alonzo
de
rova
toledo
blade
the
first
thing
he
did
caused
her
considerable
wonder
and
not
a
little
alarm
in
one
corner
of
the
room
he
pried
up
the
tiles
of
the
flooring
for
the
space
of
a
square
foot
and
cut
away
the
planking
underneath
leaving
nothing
but
some
thin
lath
and
plaster
between
them
and
the
room
below
oh
gysbert
what
art
thou
doing
asked
jacqueline
in
distress
we
will
be
discovered
and
all
will
be
lost
not
at
all
said
gysbert
as
he
covered
up
his
work
by
carefully
replacing
everything
he
had
removed
no
one
will
suspect
what
i
have
done
and
through
this
hole
we
can
listen
to
much
that
goes
on
below
we
may
hear
something
worth
while
if
we
listen
hard
enough
but
that
is
only
one
thing
i
intend
to
do
with
this
valuable
weapon
let
me
show
thee
to
what
other
use
it
may
be
put
he
went
to
the
window
reconnoitered
long
and
carefully
to
see
that
no
one
was
near
and
then
commenced
to
file
away
at
one
of
the
iron
bars
digging
carefully
into
the
wood
in
which
it
was
imbedded
and
using
every
effort
to
dislodge
it
from
the
socket
in
which
it
was
set
this
will
be
a
long
and
tedious
piece
of
work
he
remarked
there
are
three
thick
bars
each
set
stoutly
in
woodwork
nearly
as
hard
as
iron
itself
and
we
want
to
do
this
work
so
carefully
that
it
will
not
be
noticeable
should
anyone
enter
the
room
each
bar
will
have
to
be
loosened
both
top
and
bottom
and
i
know
not
how
long
it
will
take
us
we
will
work
as
constantly
as
we
can
and
i
doubt
not
in
time
we
shall
be
free
as
the
birds
as
far
as
this
window
is
concerned
is
a
good
thing
the
blade
is
sharp
and
enduring
yes
but
even
so
demurred
jacqueline
what
are
we
going
to
do
when
the
bars
are
loosed
to
be
as
free
as
the
birds
as
thou
sayest
we
must
have
wings
for
we
are
fully
twenty
feet
from
the
ground
there
are
many
ways
to
get
out
of
a
window
jacqueline
as
thou
wouldst
know
if
thou
hadst
climbed
in
and
out
of
one
as
many
times
as
i
have
but
that
too
will
all
come
in
good
season
and
meanwhile
we
must
work
away
at
the
bars
hope
even
vague
and
indefinite
hope
lends
wings
to
the
soul
and
zest
to
the
brain
and
hands
this
faint
glimmer
that
had
been
cast
across
the
blackness
of
the
two
children
prospects
so
filled
their
hearts
with
its
brightness
that
they
were
almost
gay
as
they
sawed
away
on
the
stout
iron
bars
they
would
have
shouted
and
sung
had
not
that
performance
surely
encouraged
unwelcome
attention
in
their
direction
that
same
night
gysbert
removed
the
tiles
and
piece
of
plank
from
the
hole
he
had
dug
in
the
flooring
leaning
over
it
the
children
strove
to
gather
from
any
sounds
they
might
hear
what
was
going
on
beneath
them
it
was
destined
that
they
should
hear
something
that
night
which
while
it
enlightened
them
upon
several
points
hitherto
inscrutable
served
in
no
way
to
add
to
their
peace
of
mind
the
room
just
under
theirs
was
evidently
one
that
was
not
often
used
for
it
seemed
to
be
dark
and
deserted
presently
however
a
light
shown
through
the
cracks
in
the
ceiling
someone
was
heard
moving
about
and
voices
whispered
words
that
could
not
be
distinguished
at
length
the
sentence
he
is
even
now
coming
penetrated
up
through
the
ceiling
and
there
was
another
silence
then
the
neighing
of
horses
was
heard
outside
a
loud
tramping
of
heavily
shod
feet
resounded
on
the
wooden
floors
the
door
of
the
room
below
opened
and
three
people
entered
sit
you
down
pray
sit
you
down
said
a
voice
easily
recognized
as
dirk
willumhoog
we
will
be
secure
here
from
all
interruption
and
can
talk
freely
with
absolutely
no
fear
of
being
overheard
here
gysbert
pinched
jacqueline
till
she
almost
laughed
aloud
two
gruff
voices
replied
in
monosyllables
and
there
was
a
scraping
of
chairs
and
jingling
of
spurs
as
the
two
horsemen
placed
themselves
at
the
table
now
commanded
one
of
the
gruff
voices
tell
us
quickly
dirk
willumhoog
what
is
this
plan
that
thou
hast
and
we
will
then
discuss
whether
it
be
worth
considering
nay
nay
commander
valdez
whined
dirk
we
must
not
be
quite
so
speedy
didst
thou
hear
that
jacqueline
whispered
gysbert
commander
valdez
now
we
are
going
to
hear
something
worth
while
come
come
put
in
the
third
voice
impatiently
why
all
this
parleying
if
thou
hast
a
plan
worth
considering
out
with
it
and
thou
shalt
be
recompensed
accordingly
dost
thou
think
us
willing
to
sit
here
all
night
to
split
hairs
with
such
as
thou
not
so
fast
not
so
fast
colonel
borgia
complained
dirk
if
my
plan
is
worth
anything
it
is
worth
bargaining
for
and
i
do
not
intend
to
sell
it
cheaply
i
assure
you
jacqueline
again
whispered
gysbert
there
is
some
dreadful
plan
afoot
colonel
borgia
is
the
spaniard
in
command
of
fort
lammen
the
strongest
redoubt
against
the
city
listen
well
dirk
interrupted
valdez
perceiving
evidently
that
it
would
not
do
to
try
bullying
this
subtle
rascal
tell
us
then
what
is
thy
price
for
the
service
thou
dost
propose
to
render
the
spanish
army
fifty
thousand
florins
replied
dirk
calmly
but
firmly
thousand
flying
devils
roared
valdez
pounding
the
table
with
his
fist
dost
thou
think
the
spanish
treasury
is
a
mine
of
diamonds
away
with
thee
thou
scurvy
rascal
come
borgia
is
useless
parleying
with
a
madman
gentlemen
remarked
dirk
quite
unmoved
by
this
outburst
on
the
part
of
the
spanish
general
you
do
me
wrong
did
you
but
know
my
plan
you
would
say
it
was
easily
worth
full
twice
the
amount
i
have
named
however
i
have
other
ways
of
disposing
profitably
of
my
secret
should
my
terms
not
appeal
to
you
in
the
silence
that
ensued
the
two
listeners
could
imagine
the
spaniards
consulting
each
other
with
uncertain
glances
at
last
the
voice
of
valdez
spoke
again
this
time
in
a
more
conciliatory
tone
willumhoog
i
am
not
authorized
to
offer
any
such
amount
as
thou
dost
name
but
i
swear
to
thee
that
i
will
consult
with
one
ever
gracious
and
merciful
king
philip
ii
at
the
earliest
opportunity
to
obtain
this
amount
for
thee
using
every
influence
in
my
power
will
your
worship
put
that
down
in
writing
inquired
dirk
eagerly
certainly
certainly
replied
the
general
glad
to
have
made
an
impression
so
easily
dirk
hastened
out
evidently
to
obtain
pen
and
paper
and
was
back
again
in
a
jiffy
i
have
one
more
request
to
make
he
remarked
in
honeyed
tones
as
thou
wilt
said
valdez
it
is
that
your
worship
will
write
at
my
dictation
there
was
another
uneasy
pause
and
then
the
general
acquiesced
muttering
that
he
did
not
have
to
write
anything
that
he
did
not
wish
i
general
valdez
dictated
dirk
commander
of
the
spanish
army
before
leyden
do
hereby
give
my
promise
that
i
will
intercede
with
his
majesty
philip
ii
to
pay
over
to
dirk
willumhoog
for
the
valuable
secret
he
shall
impart
concerning
an
unknown
entrance
into
the
city
the
sum
of
fifty
thousand
florins
scratch
scratch
went
the
pen
and
coming
to
this
point
valdez
exclaimed
there
now
i
will
sign
my
name
not
quite
yet
said
dirk
quietly
there
is
something
else
and
if
i
do
not
succeed
in
so
persuading
his
majesty
i
stand
ready
to
reimburse
said
dirk
willumhoog
for
the
amount
remaining
above
what
he
shall
have
already
received
out
of
my
own
private
funds
and
estates
never
shouted
valdez
springing
to
his
feet
and
clanking
around
the
room
dost
thou
take
me
for
a
fool
thou
sneaking
rascal
the
loss
will
be
all
your
worship
responded
dirk
unmoved
as
the
glory
would
also
be
could
you
but
take
the
city
by
surprise
i
am
not
asking
for
glory
i
do
not
wish
my
part
in
it
to
become
generally
known
all
i
ask
is
the
gold
valdez
and
borgia
consulted
together
for
a
moment
in
low
tones
and
the
result
of
their
consultation
seemed
to
be
the
hasty
decision
that
they
must
capitulate
very
well
declared
the
general
i
will
write
as
thou
hast
said
but
mark
my
words
thou
hadst
better
keep
out
of
my
way
dirk
willumhoog
when
this
transaction
is
completed
and
now
gentlemen
just
one
thing
more
added
dirk
when
the
writing
was
finished
and
in
his
possession
as
an
earnest
of
your
good
faith
i
require
a
thousand
florins
to
be
paid
me
at
once
more
splutterings
from
borgia
and
explosions
from
valdez
ensued
but
this
was
evidently
mere
bluster
for
after
a
due
amount
of
bickering
and
bargaining
a
clinking
of
coins
was
heard
and
money
was
counted
out
slowly
and
reluctantly
there
said
valdez
thou
hast
now
every
jot
thou
didst
demand
out
with
thy
secret
and
be
quick
about
it
for
we
have
not
all
night
to
spend
this
then
is
my
story
answered
dirk
i
have
discovered
never
mind
how
a
passageway
through
a
certain
part
of
the
wall
of
leyden
not
a
soul
knows
of
its
existence
save
myself
and
none
could
ever
find
it
unassisted
for
i
myself
stumbled
upon
it
quite
by
chance
there
is
room
for
but
one
to
pass
through
at
a
time
and
the
passage
is
dangerous
but
it
would
be
an
easy
matter
to
introduce
a
regiment
of
soldiers
through
it
in
the
night
and
in
the
morning
the
town
would
be
yours
for
the
inhabitants
are
all
too
weak
from
starvation
to
make
much
resistance
but
where
this
secret
passage
demanded
valdez
that
will
i
not
divulge
till
i
lead
the
first
soldier
through
it
replied
willumhoog
shrewdly
when
does
your
worship
think
would
be
the
best
and
earliest
opportunity
to
effect
the
entrance
again
valdez
and
borgia
consulted
together
is
the
thirtieth
of
september
replied
the
general
on
the
night
of
october
third
we
will
have
all
in
readiness
and
thou
shalt
fulfill
thy
promise
at
the
same
time
colonel
borgia
shall
make
an
assault
upon
the
wall
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
city
and
thus
draw
off
the
attention
from
our
place
of
ingress
with
a
few
more
remarks
relative
to
the
payment
of
the
money
and
a
hasty
and
anything
but
cordial
the
two
spaniards
tramped
out
mounted
their
horses
and
rode
away
the
lights
in
the
room
below
were
extinguished
the
door
was
shut
and
darkness
and
silence
reigned
throughout
the
farmhouse
but
up
in
their
prison
room
the
two
children
clasped
each
other
and
shuddered
with
horror
at
the
dark
crime
that
was
soon
to
be
committed
it
is
frightful
gysbert
moaned
jacqueline
our
beautiful
city
that
has
so
long
and
so
bravely
held
out
will
be
given
over
by
this
traitor
to
the
spanish
fury
but
what
makes
me
feel
the
worst
raged
gysbert
is
that
i
could
not
warn
the
burgomaster
of
that
breach
as
the
prince
bade
me
why
did
i
not
think
to
tell
mynheer
van
der
werf
before
i
went
away
why
didst
not
thou
tell
him
jacqueline
i
somehow
never
thought
of
it
when
i
was
with
him
and
he
never
asked
me
how
dirk
got
in
i
think
his
mind
was
all
but
distracted
with
the
burden
of
the
city
distress
so
that
he
could
give
no
heed
to
what
seemed
then
but
a
comparatively
light
matter
oh
gysbert
can
we
do
nothing
about
it
surely
god
who
led
us
to
overhear
this
vile
plot
will
show
us
the
way
to
foil
it
i
think
he
will
said
gysbert
reverently
and
anyhow
i
am
going
to
pray
that
he
show
us
some
means
of
getting
out
of
our
prison
and
warning
the
city
wilt
thou
too
jacqueline
i
will
indeed
answered
the
girl
and
before
we
go
to
bed
we
will
work
long
at
the
bars
for
that
seems
our
surest
means
of
escape
only
three
days
groaned
gysbert
i
would
that
it
were
as
many
times
as
far
away
but
in
three
days
we
can
do
much
if
we
work
hard
when
the
wind
changed
chapter
xvi
when
the
wind
changed
all
the
next
day
the
children
bent
every
effort
toward
sawing
and
digging
away
at
their
window
bars
but
the
hours
wore
away
and
only
one
had
been
completely
loosened
while
another
was
unfastened
at
the
bottom
the
was
becoming
dull
with
this
rough
usage
and
their
courage
dropped
in
proportion
as
their
strength
gave
out
and
night
approached
well
on
in
the
afternoon
gysbert
again
removed
the
tiles
and
planking
for
both
had
imagined
they
heard
unusual
sounds
in
the
room
below
they
were
not
mistaken
a
moment
listening
convinced
them
that
it
was
dirk
and
the
wife
of
joachim
hansleer
holding
an
animated
conversation
in
low
tones
give
me
my
share
now
dirk
they
heard
the
woman
say
if
thou
art
going
to
depart
for
spain
shortly
it
will
be
just
as
well
to
settle
up
this
matter
at
once
i
know
not
where
my
good
man
joachim
is
nor
when
i
will
see
him
again
and
i
need
the
money
i
shall
not
depart
for
spain
with
those
brats
till
after
the
sack
of
the
city
when
the
boy
ought
to
be
better
i
do
not
half
believe
he
is
as
ill
as
he
makes
out
to
be
why
canst
thou
not
wait
till
then
answered
dirk
i
must
go
away
this
afternoon
and
will
probably
not
be
back
till
after
the
third
i
am
going
to
make
one
more
test
to
see
if
my
secret
is
still
safe
and
practicable
when
i
return
will
be
time
enough
thou
art
a
slippery
eel
dirk
willumhoog
and
that
i
know
right
well
replied
the
woman
after
the
excitement
is
all
over
thou
wouldst
find
some
means
of
sliding
away
without
paying
up
thy
just
debts
i
swear
to
thee
that
if
thou
dost
not
pay
me
at
once
those
three
hundred
florins
which
are
due
me
for
my
trouble
i
will
go
straightway
upstairs
after
thou
art
gone
to
the
city
and
release
those
two
children
and
i
care
not
what
may
be
the
consequences
this
argument
evidently
convinced
dirk
that
it
would
be
best
to
parley
no
longer
with
the
decided
vrouw
hansleer
but
pay
her
at
once
there
was
a
clinking
of
coins
a
counting
aloud
several
disputes
over
the
reckoning
and
at
last
the
matter
was
settled
and
peace
restored
remember
warned
dirk
as
they
were
leaving
the
room
to
guard
those
children
well
for
they
will
surely
mean
more
money
to
us
then
the
door
was
shut
and
the
listeners
heard
no
more
what
can
all
this
mean
queried
gysbert
didst
thou
hear
him
speak
of
those
two
brats
to
spain
in
a
short
time
that
means
us
of
course
what
can
he
possibly
mean
to
do
with
us
there
and
how
can
we
bring
him
more
money
one
would
think
we
were
important
personages
and
he
was
trying
to
get
a
ransom
for
us
it
is
all
dark
and
mysterious
answered
his
sister
but
if
we
do
what
we
hope
master
willumhoog
will
receive
a
little
surprise
before
october
third
come
we
must
waste
no
more
time
but
work
away
later
on
they
saw
dirk
willumhoog
leave
the
house
carrying
with
him
a
bag
which
they
did
not
doubt
contained
the
remaining
seven
hundred
florins
while
watching
his
progress
down
the
road
gysbert
attention
suddenly
became
fixed
on
something
in
the
sky
and
he
seized
jacqueline
arm
excitedly
look
look
he
cried
dost
thou
see
i
see
nothing
what
is
it
why
the
wind
is
changing
look
at
those
black
clouds
rising
out
of
the
northwest
look
at
the
leaves
of
the
trees
all
bending
toward
the
east
look
at
the
birds
flying
so
low
i
tell
thee
jacqueline
we
are
going
to
have
a
terrible
storm
the
equinoctial
gale
should
have
come
a
week
ago
but
it
is
here
at
last
what
gysbert
predicted
was
quite
correct
the
continual
east
wind
had
at
last
shifted
to
the
northwest
bringing
with
it
the
strong
salt
smell
of
the
sea
the
sky
was
still
beautifully
clear
and
blue
but
a
person
would
have
certainly
read
the
signs
of
coming
change
dirk
willumhoog
was
now
far
out
of
sight
but
they
saw
vrouw
hansleer
come
out
to
the
yard
and
scan
the
horizon
anxiously
here
jacqueline
said
gysbert
when
the
woman
had
gone
in
give
me
that
knife
now
while
thou
dost
take
a
rest
we
must
get
along
even
faster
for
if
the
wind
holds
and
the
water
rises
there
will
be
fine
doings
and
we
want
to
be
prepared
to
take
our
part
look
i
think
the
top
of
this
end
bar
will
give
way
in
a
short
time
this
surely
will
float
the
fleet
will
it
not
asked
his
sister
the
night
i
was
captured
boisot
sent
a
message
that
he
was
at
nord
aa
but
must
remain
there
until
the
water
rose
they
have
probably
been
stranded
there
ever
since
surely
surely
answered
gysbert
and
what
is
more
we
ought
to
have
a
full
view
from
our
little
window
here
if
they
come
by
for
though
we
are
a
good
distance
from
the
canal
i
think
we
could
get
a
fine
sight
of
a
battle
if
there
is
to
be
one
oh
i
hope
there
will
be
a
battle
in
a
frenzy
of
excitement
they
kept
at
their
work
till
darkness
fell
before
the
last
streaks
of
twilight
had
faded
they
had
witnessed
the
puddles
in
the
road
grow
and
spread
into
small
ponds
the
ponds
widen
and
join
themselves
into
a
shallow
lake
which
lapped
against
the
walls
of
the
house
then
came
the
tempest
the
wind
raged
and
howled
the
sky
was
black
with
clouds
the
tree
branches
tossed
and
groaned
or
were
split
asunder
with
loud
cracking
noises
the
walls
of
the
farmhouse
shook
the
windows
rattled
and
pandemonium
itself
seemed
let
loose
the
children
trembled
half
with
awed
admiration
at
this
war
in
the
elements
half
with
delight
at
what
this
would
mean
to
the
besieged
city
and
clasped
their
hands
convulsively
at
every
louder
roar
of
the
wind
or
crash
of
huge
trees
falling
down
below
it
was
evident
that
panic
and
disorder
reigned
supreme
cries
and
shouts
of
dismay
mingled
with
the
shrill
screaming
of
a
woman
voice
once
they
heard
vrouw
hansleer
splash
out
into
the
flooded
yard
calling
to
someone
unseen
in
the
darkness
come
wilhelm
come
and
help
me
move
my
furniture
oh
my
beautiful
furniture
it
will
all
be
ruined
zounds
woman
responded
the
voice
dost
thou
think
thou
canst
save
thy
wretched
furniture
in
this
pass
thou
shalt
be
thankful
to
get
off
with
thy
life
take
what
thou
canst
carry
and
be
quick
for
the
is
broken
through
and
the
flood
will
soon
be
upon
us
hurry
hurry
i
say
merciful
anthony
i
can
hear
it
roar
now
and
true
enough
from
far
in
the
distance
came
a
faint
ominous
sound
low
at
first
as
the
sighing
of
a
summer
breeze
yet
dreadful
enough
to
those
who
understood
it
to
paralyze
every
muscle
with
terror
with
one
final
shriek
vrouw
hansleer
darted
into
the
house
for
a
moment
then
out
again
and
the
children
heard
the
retreating
footsteps
splashing
hurriedly
down
the
road
after
that
a
deathlike
silence
reigned
in
the
house
gysbert
they
have
gone
and
left
us
cried
the
terrified
jacqueline
left
us
to
perish
here
like
rats
drowned
in
a
trap
when
the
flood
reaches
us
oh
it
is
cruel
cruel
nonsense
retorted
her
brother
this
is
the
finest
thing
that
could
have
happened
i
am
certain
the
flood
will
not
rise
higher
than
these
windows
so
we
will
be
perfectly
safe
from
drowning
and
now
that
they
have
deserted
the
house
we
can
turn
our
attention
to
getting
out
of
the
door
somehow
and
not
bother
with
these
window
bars
any
longer
i
feel
certain
the
wood
of
the
door
will
yield
to
this
knife
and
when
we
have
made
a
hole
big
enough
we
can
crawl
out
or
burst
it
open
or
pull
back
the
bolts
or
something
but
we
must
be
quick
about
it
for
we
want
to
get
ahead
of
dirk
and
warn
the
city
before
october
third
that
is
the
day
after
in
the
pitchy
darkness
they
groped
and
found
the
door
gysbert
began
immediately
to
hack
away
at
one
of
the
panels
finding
that
it
offered
much
less
resistance
than
did
the
deeply
imbedded
iron
bars
of
the
window
courage
jacqueline
he
called
at
intervals
we
are
going
to
make
it
soon
without
fail
but
thou
hadst
best
keep
watch
at
the
window
the
storm
far
from
abating
increased
in
violence
the
wind
shifted
again
from
the
northwest
to
the
southwest
piling
up
the
waters
of
the
german
ocean
in
huge
masses
and
dashing
them
against
the
broken
dykes
at
about
eleven
the
ominous
distant
murmur
increased
to
a
loud
roar
jacqueline
at
the
window
called
to
gysbert
and
together
they
watched
the
terrible
sight
or
as
much
of
it
as
they
could
see
in
the
darkness
the
dreadful
approached
nearer
and
nearer
till
with
an
sound
it
suddenly
appeared
out
of
the
gloom
a
huge
black
wall
of
water
nearly
ten
feet
high
rolling
forward
with
incredible
swiftness
deluging
submerging
or
pushing
before
it
everything
that
came
in
its
way
for
one
horrible
instant
it
surged
about
the
house
rocking
the
structure
to
its
very
foundations
and
threatening
to
uproot
it
outright
and
fling
it
to
the
ground
but
the
house
stood
firm
and
the
vanguard
of
the
flood
passed
on
leaving
the
water
well
up
to
the
second
story
window
and
burying
all
else
in
its
swirling
depths
when
this
moment
of
danger
was
past
the
children
breathed
again
gysbert
went
back
to
his
work
on
the
door
with
only
an
i
told
thee
so
while
jacqueline
kept
watch
at
her
post
by
the
window
the
black
waters
just
a
little
way
below
her
seemed
dangerously
near
and
she
imagined
them
to
be
rapidly
rising
but
as
they
were
not
yet
up
to
the
window
the
children
were
for
the
present
at
least
safe
at
midnight
another
panorama
was
spread
before
their
eyes
while
gysbert
was
digging
away
at
the
door
jacqueline
was
suddenly
startled
by
a
bright
flash
and
a
sharp
report
across
the
black
waste
of
waters
instantly
it
was
followed
by
a
resounding
roar
as
from
the
mouths
of
twenty
cannon
gysbert
dropped
the
knife
and
rushed
to
the
window
the
fleet
the
fleet
he
cried
they
have
passed
the
and
are
making
their
way
toward
the
city
long
live
admiral
boisot
it
was
indeed
the
doughty
admiral
and
his
fearless
beggars
of
the
sea
up
till
that
day
he
had
been
all
but
in
despair
and
had
even
written
to
the
prince
of
orange
that
the
expedition
must
be
abandoned
if
the
wind
did
not
change
then
came
the
storm
the
waters
rose
and
the
already
broken
through
was
soon
levelled
and
the
flotilla
passed
in
triumph
at
midnight
toward
the
village
of
zoeterwoude
not
half
a
mile
distant
from
the
farmhouse
in
which
the
children
were
incarcerated
the
fleet
received
its
first
challenge
from
the
guarding
spanish
sentinels
and
answered
with
such
a
roar
of
cannon
as
all
but
staggered
the
astounded
outposts
then
ensued
a
terrible
battle
amid
a
scene
perhaps
the
strangest
in
which
ever
a
battle
was
fought
from
out
the
village
of
zoeterwoude
flocked
the
spanish
making
their
way
in
any
kind
of
craft
on
which
they
could
lay
hands
the
fleet
found
itself
progressing
amid
and
orchards
interspersed
with
chimney
stacks
and
the
roofs
of
low
houses
in
this
strange
surrounding
they
grappled
with
the
spanish
enemy
all
the
advantage
however
was
on
their
side
as
they
had
but
to
upset
the
frail
crafts
of
the
spanish
in
order
to
create
the
most
utter
rout
in
the
ranks
of
the
enemy
from
the
window
the
children
watched
the
strange
spectacle
the
room
being
frequently
illuminated
by
the
glare
from
the
cannons
so
near
were
they
that
even
the
shouts
and
cries
reached
them
distinctly
and
once
was
borne
to
them
across
the
waters
the
song
of
the
beggars
uplifted
in
a
swelling
chorus
of
triumphant
voices
long
live
the
beggars
wilt
thou
god
word
cherish
long
live
the
beggars
bold
of
heart
and
hand
long
live
the
beggars
god
will
not
see
thee
perish
long
live
the
beggars
oh
noble
christian
band
then
the
fleet
swept
on
and
though
the
sound
of
shouting
and
cannonading
diminished
but
little
the
battle
passed
out
of
the
range
of
the
children
vision
when
morning
dawned
over
the
waste
of
gray
waters
it
revealed
a
weird
and
desolate
scene
outside
the
window
but
inside
it
lighted
up
a
door
in
which
gysbert
had
carved
a
hole
long
enough
for
him
to
reach
his
arm
through
and
unloose
the
bolts
a
crash
in
the
night
chapter
xvii
a
crash
in
the
night
with
a
mighty
effort
gysbert
drew
back
the
massive
bolt
and
chain
that
had
so
long
kept
them
prisoners
pushed
open
the
demolished
door
and
they
stood
outside
the
room
free
at
last
go
cautiously
warned
he
we
are
not
yet
absolutely
sure
that
everyone
is
out
of
the
house
but
i
have
this
knife
if
we
meet
anyone
and
it
comes
to
the
worst
we
wo
try
to
go
down
stairs
it
would
be
like
diving
into
a
tank
and
indeed
the
water
had
entered
the
house
and
crept
of
the
way
up
the
staircase
while
bumping
against
the
ceiling
of
the
rooms
below
floated
articles
of
vrouw
cherished
furniture
from
room
to
room
on
the
second
floor
the
children
crept
carefully
listening
and
waiting
before
they
entered
any
door
but
the
house
was
plainly
deserted
except
for
themselves
and
in
a
short
time
they
abandoned
all
caution
rollicking
about
in
their
new
freedom
like
a
couple
of
theirs
they
soon
discovered
were
the
only
other
bedrooms
on
that
floor
and
of
course
the
only
ones
with
barred
windows
two
other
large
apartments
occupied
the
remaining
space
one
evidently
used
as
a
storeroom
the
other
as
a
granary
both
had
large
open
windows
through
which
it
would
be
easy
to
pass
for
a
long
time
they
stood
at
one
of
these
windows
watching
the
strange
sight
outside
the
water
swept
by
from
the
ocean
inward
with
a
rapid
current
bearing
on
its
surface
every
imaginable
article
that
could
float
boxes
barrels
furniture
of
every
description
parts
of
houses
here
and
there
a
struggling
cow
or
pig
and
not
infrequently
a
great
haystack
striking
out
majestically
on
its
impromptu
voyage
once
a
baby
cradle
completely
furnished
came
in
sight
and
jacqueline
went
nearly
wild
with
terror
and
excitement
lest
it
might
bear
a
precious
burden
in
its
wrappings
but
as
it
was
swept
nearer
they
saw
that
it
was
empty
and
both
children
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
meanwhile
gysbert
of
the
fertile
brain
had
already
concocted
a
plan
of
escape
i
tell
thee
jacqueline
we
shall
get
out
of
here
in
the
easiest
way
imaginable
if
we
can
only
fish
out
of
this
muddle
the
thing
we
need
sooner
or
later
some
small
boat
is
bound
to
come
along
i
know
it
for
i
saw
one
way
off
there
just
now
too
far
away
to
reach
first
we
will
try
to
forage
up
something
to
eat
if
that
is
possible
for
i
am
nearly
starved
and
thou
must
be
also
then
we
will
each
station
ourselves
at
a
window
i
in
this
room
and
thou
in
the
granary
to
watch
for
a
boat
in
this
way
we
can
see
from
both
directions
i
will
be
prepared
to
swim
for
it
if
it
comes
near
enough
and
then
the
matter
will
be
simple
aye
but
i
advise
thee
to
first
wash
thy
face
responded
jacqueline
gaily
that
countenance
of
thine
would
frighten
away
any
rescuers
we
might
encounter
and
so
laughing
gysbert
followed
her
advice
leaning
out
of
the
window
to
dabble
his
hands
in
the
water
that
now
lapped
within
a
foot
of
the
sill
breakfast
was
about
as
difficult
a
matter
as
any
they
had
to
undertake
for
everything
eatable
was
downstairs
and
it
would
be
worse
than
useless
to
attempt
procuring
anything
from
those
depths
beside
they
had
very
little
notion
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
the
kitchen
so
they
turned
again
to
the
windows
to
solve
their
problem
counting
it
almost
certain
that
eatables
of
some
sort
must
in
due
time
go
sailing
by
their
watch
was
long
but
not
in
vain
for
in
an
hour
or
so
there
hove
in
sight
a
loaf
of
bread
floating
so
close
that
it
was
within
reach
of
a
long
stick
which
they
used
to
secure
their
treasure
and
unsavory
as
it
was
they
devoured
it
with
unspeakable
relish
for
was
it
not
the
first
meal
they
had
eaten
in
freedom
this
many
a
weary
day
then
came
the
watch
for
the
craft
that
was
to
bear
them
away
but
the
morning
wore
on
and
though
they
strained
their
eyes
in
every
direction
nothing
in
the
least
available
came
into
view
the
water
continued
to
rise
till
it
was
only
six
inches
below
the
window
ledge
and
should
it
come
much
further
their
position
might
be
reckoned
exceedingly
precarious
what
they
should
do
if
the
second
floor
became
flooded
except
climb
out
on
the
roof
they
could
not
imagine
at
last
well
on
in
the
afternoon
jacqueline
called
excitedly
from
her
lookout
gysbert
gysbert
come
here
immediately
the
very
thing
he
was
at
her
side
in
an
instant
and
there
sure
enough
coming
rapidly
down
stream
was
a
little
shallow
rowboat
bobbing
gaily
along
on
the
waves
in
a
very
few
moments
it
would
be
abreast
of
them
i
have
to
swim
for
it
said
gysbert
it
too
far
away
to
reach
with
the
pole
hastily
flinging
off
some
of
his
outer
garments
he
plunged
out
of
the
window
he
reached
the
spot
opposite
the
window
not
an
instant
too
soon
just
as
the
stern
of
the
boat
swung
by
he
grasped
it
and
climbed
clumsily
aboard
but
to
jacqueline
surprise
he
did
not
instantly
grasp
the
oars
and
start
to
pull
back
instead
he
put
his
hands
to
his
mouth
shouted
no
oars
and
in
a
twinkling
was
swept
from
her
sight
for
a
moment
the
situation
did
not
seem
very
serious
and
she
waited
calmly
thinking
he
would
soon
pick
up
an
oar
or
a
pole
and
return
to
her
but
the
time
passed
on
and
he
did
not
come
the
minutes
grew
into
half
an
hour
then
dragged
themselves
out
to
a
full
hour
still
no
gysbert
jacqueline
became
almost
distracted
and
the
situation
warranted
every
fear
that
thronged
her
terrified
soul
suppose
the
water
should
rise
and
flood
the
room
suppose
the
night
should
fall
and
add
its
horrors
to
the
prospect
suppose
dirk
willumhoog
should
return
and
snatch
her
away
to
unknown
terrors
suppose
gysbert
should
be
swamped
in
his
little
boat
and
drowned
suppose
but
the
accumulated
burden
of
these
fears
was
too
great
to
be
borne
she
fell
on
her
knees
by
the
window
ledge
in
an
agony
of
prayer
but
could
only
murmur
oh
god
god
god
help
the
afternoon
waned
and
twilight
drew
down
the
water
was
now
within
an
inch
of
the
window
ledge
but
jacqueline
did
not
notice
she
knelt
with
her
head
buried
in
her
arms
and
neither
saw
nor
heard
anything
suddenly
she
was
aroused
from
this
by
a
loud
shout
she
raised
her
head
and
perceived
to
her
delight
a
bulky
canal
vessel
so
close
that
it
looked
as
though
it
were
about
to
sail
right
in
the
window
over
the
prow
leaned
gysbert
and
a
man
whose
face
she
did
not
recognize
oh
jacqueline
called
her
brother
didst
thou
think
i
had
forsaken
thee
well
i
had
the
amazing
good
fortune
to
be
picked
up
by
herr
captain
joris
fruytiers
and
we
came
at
once
to
get
thee
it
took
but
a
moment
to
launch
the
little
boat
and
take
jacqueline
on
board
as
she
crept
into
the
boat
gysbert
noticed
that
the
water
was
just
beginning
to
trickle
over
the
into
the
room
jacqueline
we
were
a
moment
too
soon
were
we
he
remarked
gravely
when
the
girl
had
been
established
in
comfortable
quarters
in
the
roomy
old
gysbert
told
her
the
history
of
his
adventures
since
he
had
been
swept
from
her
sight
he
had
at
first
felt
perfectly
confident
of
finding
an
oar
or
a
pole
floating
along
in
the
general
confusion
so
he
did
not
jump
out
and
swim
back
as
he
might
have
done
but
the
current
bore
him
on
and
on
and
nothing
available
did
he
see
in
all
his
journey
presently
as
he
was
watching
over
one
side
of
the
boat
he
heard
a
hearty
voice
call
out
from
the
opposite
direction
ship
ahoy
well
if
that
is
a
pretty
small
fry
commanding
that
bark
and
he
recognized
the
gruff
voice
of
his
former
acquaintance
on
the
road
to
delft
captain
fruytiers
had
lost
no
time
in
getting
both
himself
and
his
little
boat
aboard
the
big
lugger
which
he
said
he
was
taking
to
join
the
fleet
of
boisot
at
zwieten
gysbert
quickly
told
the
bluff
captain
his
story
and
easily
persuaded
him
to
turn
back
and
rescue
jacqueline
from
her
perilous
position
this
was
all
except
that
from
some
passing
vessel
they
had
picked
up
the
news
that
the
fleet
had
made
a
most
triumphant
progress
all
day
scattering
the
spaniards
right
and
left
as
they
poured
from
the
captured
fortresses
and
fled
along
the
road
to
the
hague
but
boisot
had
now
arrived
before
the
strongest
spanish
redoubt
the
fortress
of
lammen
less
than
five
hundred
rods
from
the
city
here
he
was
obliged
to
halt
for
it
swarmed
with
soldiers
bristled
with
artillery
and
defied
the
fleet
to
either
capture
it
by
force
or
pass
under
its
guns
the
admiral
hoped
to
carry
the
fort
next
morning
but
he
expected
a
stiff
battle
joris
fruytiers
was
to
join
the
rear
of
the
flotilla
and
help
to
swell
its
numbers
plainly
it
was
no
situation
for
jacqueline
in
the
midst
of
these
beggars
of
the
sea
and
yet
no
safer
place
could
be
found
for
her
at
present
so
it
was
decided
that
she
should
remain
on
board
but
gysbert
head
was
full
of
another
plan
for
himself
i
get
into
the
city
somehow
it
would
be
horrible
with
relief
so
near
to
have
that
scoundrel
dirk
lead
in
a
spanish
regiment
and
bring
about
an
untimely
surrender
he
urged
what
is
more
i
have
not
a
minute
to
spare
for
night
the
deed
is
to
be
done
if
i
can
get
in
it
will
be
time
enough
to
warn
the
burgomaster
and
raise
a
defending
corps
to
guard
the
breach
stay
thou
here
with
good
joris
fruytiers
and
i
will
take
the
small
boat
and
a
pair
of
oars
and
row
to
the
side
where
i
can
get
through
the
scattering
army
and
into
dirk
willumhoog
clever
little
entrance
so
jacqueline
acquiesced
and
watched
her
brother
row
away
with
much
trepidation
and
many
muttered
prayers
for
his
safety
darkness
soon
shut
each
boat
from
the
sight
of
the
other
but
gysbert
paddled
on
keeping
clear
of
floating
debris
as
best
he
could
and
trying
hard
to
ascertain
through
the
blackness
just
what
was
his
location
several
times
he
found
himself
far
out
of
his
course
and
thus
more
than
one
valuable
hour
was
lost
at
length
however
the
water
became
too
shallow
to
continue
rowing
and
he
disembarked
tying
the
boat
to
a
tree
by
several
signs
he
recognized
the
spot
to
be
near
where
he
had
come
out
of
the
hidden
tunnel
several
weeks
ago
of
the
spanish
army
at
this
spot
there
remained
but
a
few
stragglers
gathering
up
their
possessions
gysbert
concluded
that
the
safest
place
for
him
was
the
tree
to
which
he
had
tied
his
boat
and
he
was
soon
among
its
branches
from
here
he
watched
the
departure
of
the
last
spaniard
and
was
just
about
to
descend
when
one
solitary
sneaking
shadow
attracted
his
attention
in
the
blackness
of
the
night
he
could
discover
little
of
its
intentions
but
as
it
moved
off
in
the
direction
of
the
wall
he
decided
to
get
down
and
follow
it
the
shadow
glided
along
straight
for
the
wall
till
it
finally
disappeared
behind
the
bushes
that
hid
the
secret
opening
when
gysbert
arrived
on
the
spot
there
was
not
even
a
shadow
to
be
seen
then
a
great
light
dawned
on
his
mind
dirk
willumhoog
he
whispered
what
on
earth
am
i
to
do
now
for
a
moment
he
stood
undecided
he
dared
not
venture
into
the
secret
passage
while
his
enemy
was
there
and
should
dirk
not
come
back
it
was
still
very
unsafe
for
he
might
be
guarding
the
other
entrance
but
the
matter
was
soon
to
be
solved
in
a
way
very
different
from
any
he
could
possibly
have
imagined
while
he
stood
considering
his
course
he
was
startled
by
a
curious
rumbling
sound
that
appeared
to
emanate
from
the
very
earth
under
his
feet
then
there
were
grinding
and
groaning
noises
low
and
indistinct
but
terrifying
beyond
imagination
gysbert
hair
fairly
rose
on
his
head
and
something
impelled
him
to
beat
the
hastiest
kind
of
a
retreat
turning
on
his
heel
he
ran
with
all
speed
to
his
boat
unmoored
it
pushed
it
off
and
rowed
far
out
upon
the
black
water
suddenly
there
was
a
terrific
sound
like
an
explosion
then
a
crash
that
shook
the
earth
for
miles
around
and
made
gysbert
little
boat
rock
on
the
waves
till
it
all
but
completely
when
the
boy
recovered
himself
enough
to
realize
what
had
happened
it
did
not
take
him
long
to
explain
the
dreadful
sounds
undermined
by
the
stream
so
long
secretly
eating
at
its
base
the
whole
wall
of
leyden
between
the
cow
gate
and
the
tower
of
burgundy
had
suddenly
fallen
in
utter
ruins
the
dawn
of
october
third
chapter
xviii
the
dawn
of
october
third
gysbert
rowed
away
frantically
from
the
scene
of
destruction
he
had
not
for
the
moment
the
slightest
idea
what
direction
he
was
taking
but
his
mind
was
actively
at
work
the
wall
of
leyden
had
fallen
in
for
the
space
of
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
mile
if
the
spaniards
had
the
faintest
suspicion
of
this
he
reasoned
they
would
flock
immediately
to
the
scene
and
make
an
easy
and
terrible
entrance
there
was
no
defending
the
breach
from
the
for
the
brave
but
corps
of
john
van
der
does
would
be
as
nothing
before
the
fierce
thousands
of
the
spanish
army
to
his
mind
there
remained
but
one
course
he
must
in
some
way
get
word
to
admiral
boisot
and
his
sea
beggars
and
let
them
make
an
entrance
into
the
city
before
the
spaniards
got
wind
of
the
disaster
with
this
end
in
view
he
looked
about
him
ascertained
as
nearly
as
he
could
the
position
of
the
fleet
and
commenced
to
row
steadily
in
that
direction
as
he
drew
near
the
fortress
of
lammen
however
he
became
aware
that
something
very
strange
was
taking
place
wonderingly
he
shipped
his
oars
and
turned
about
to
watch
the
curious
sight
myriads
of
tiny
lights
twinkled
across
the
dark
waste
of
waters
there
was
almost
no
sound
but
only
a
vague
impression
that
something
mysterious
was
happening
after
a
time
the
lights
formed
themselves
into
a
long
procession
which
seemed
to
flit
steadily
across
the
one
remaining
causeway
that
led
to
the
hague
the
boy
sat
breathless
eager
marvelling
at
this
apparently
procession
of
lights
twinkling
in
single
file
over
what
seemed
the
very
face
of
the
water
for
a
time
he
could
find
no
explanation
for
this
singular
spectacle
till
all
at
once
the
truth
flashed
on
him
the
spaniards
were
retreating
under
cover
of
darkness
they
were
silently
sneaking
away
fleeing
from
the
unknown
terror
of
that
hideous
sound
in
the
night
fleeing
like
cowards
at
the
very
moment
when
fortune
had
rendered
their
entrance
to
the
coveted
city
as
easy
as
stepping
over
a
log
truly
had
god
providence
operated
in
a
marvellous
manner
at
the
crash
of
the
falling
wall
the
terrified
citizens
of
leyden
believed
that
the
spaniards
had
at
last
effected
their
entrance
in
some
horrible
way
the
spanish
on
the
other
hand
felt
certain
that
the
citizens
were
making
a
final
desperate
sortie
and
between
this
new
danger
on
one
side
and
the
fierce
sea
beggars
and
the
ocean
on
the
other
they
deemed
retreat
to
be
their
only
course
short
of
complete
extermination
and
they
fled
away
in
the
night
for
two
hours
gysbert
sat
in
his
little
boat
and
watched
the
retreat
in
all
the
city
of
leyden
or
its
environments
he
was
the
only
soul
that
night
who
was
aware
of
the
true
state
of
affairs
at
length
the
last
few
straggling
lights
disappeared
and
all
was
silence
and
darkness
when
he
was
convinced
that
a
nearer
approach
was
safe
he
rowed
slowly
toward
fort
lammen
reconnoitering
carefully
at
almost
every
yard
but
the
nearer
he
drew
the
plainer
it
became
that
the
fort
was
absolutely
deserted
boldly
landing
at
the
foot
of
the
battlement
he
entered
at
the
gate
and
found
the
enclosure
empty
colonel
borgia
and
his
troops
had
fled
so
hastily
that
even
some
of
their
were
left
behind
gysbert
was
not
content
however
with
ascertaining
only
the
condition
of
lammen
it
was
quite
possible
that
the
retreating
army
had
halted
at
leyderdorp
the
headquarters
of
valdez
half
a
mile
away
now
that
he
was
about
it
he
concluded
that
he
might
as
well
investigate
there
before
daylight
again
pushing
off
his
boat
he
paddled
across
the
shallow
lake
that
now
spread
over
what
was
ordinarily
but
leyderdorp
was
also
deserted
guided
by
a
dying
he
reached
a
small
building
which
he
guessed
to
be
the
abode
of
general
valdez
the
fire
was
built
before
the
doorway
and
over
it
was
still
cooking
a
pot
of
or
stewed
meat
and
vegetables
evidently
it
had
been
intended
for
the
breakfast
of
the
general
but
so
speedy
had
been
the
retreat
that
it
was
left
behind
in
the
hurry
whew
ejaculated
gysbert
leaning
over
the
pot
this
smells
right
savory
to
a
stomach
that
has
had
nothing
but
half
a
loaf
thanks
my
cowardly
friends
i
partake
of
your
bounty
before
i
do
another
thing
swinging
the
pot
from
its
hook
and
scarcely
waiting
for
it
to
cool
he
helped
himself
to
a
large
quantity
doled
out
with
a
great
iron
spoon
and
ate
as
only
a
healthy
boy
can
eat
till
he
could
hold
no
more
hunger
satisfied
he
proceeded
to
investigate
the
fleeing
quarters
by
the
dying
he
could
discern
several
maps
of
leyden
and
the
outlying
districts
pinned
about
the
walls
and
on
the
table
lay
a
scrap
of
paper
hastily
written
upon
gysbert
took
it
out
to
the
fire
coaxed
the
embers
into
a
blaze
and
kneeling
over
the
flames
tried
to
decipher
the
writing
it
was
in
latin
and
very
poor
latin
at
that
and
was
plainly
the
general
farewell
to
the
city
gysbert
had
been
for
over
a
year
studying
this
language
in
school
so
he
was
able
to
construe
its
meaning
fairly
well
civitas
he
read
castelli
parvii
qui
relicti
estis
propter
aquam
et
non
per
vim
inimicorum
civitas
that
city
of
leyden
i
suppose
castelli
parvii
what
in
the
world
can
he
mean
by
that
if
i
had
written
such
stuff
in
the
the
master
would
have
boxed
my
ears
and
kept
me
in
from
play
for
three
days
to
write
my
conjugations
what
this
doughty
spaniard
to
remark
was
probably
miserable
town
thou
art
abandoned
because
of
the
water
and
not
because
of
the
strength
of
thy
resistance
oh
ho
noble
valdez
thy
latin
is
as
poor
as
thy
courage
i
must
keep
this
carefully
to
hand
to
admiral
boisot
but
the
dawn
was
already
breaking
and
gysbert
hurried
back
to
lammen
carrying
with
him
as
a
souvenir
the
iron
pot
of
early
that
morning
there
was
to
be
a
combined
assault
on
the
fort
by
the
fleet
and
the
citizens
of
the
town
the
day
before
boisot
had
despatched
the
last
pigeon
into
the
city
urging
the
starving
populace
to
aid
him
in
one
last
desperate
attack
with
the
first
streaks
of
daylight
all
was
in
readiness
and
the
admiral
prepared
to
push
his
fleet
under
the
very
guns
of
lammen
but
to
his
great
astonishment
as
the
flotilla
drew
nearer
not
a
sound
came
from
within
the
fort
not
a
vestige
of
life
was
to
be
seen
anywhere
a
sickening
fear
assailed
him
that
the
spaniards
had
entered
the
walls
during
the
night
which
would
explain
the
hideous
sounds
he
had
heard
and
were
already
sacking
the
city
suddenly
upon
the
summit
of
the
breastwork
appeared
the
figure
of
a
small
boy
with
one
hand
he
waved
his
cap
and
in
the
other
he
brandished
a
great
pot
of
come
on
come
on
he
shouted
they
gone
they
fled
in
the
night
have
no
fear
for
a
moment
good
boisot
could
hardly
believe
his
senses
but
his
sailors
lost
no
time
pushed
the
fleet
to
the
very
walls
of
the
fortress
and
found
it
to
be
true
past
the
terrible
lammen
they
floated
in
triumph
the
watching
wondering
citizens
of
the
city
opened
the
gates
with
shouts
of
joy
and
the
conquering
fleet
sailed
in
leyden
was
saved
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
were
the
canals
and
docks
lined
with
throngs
of
the
starving
populace
they
grasped
with
famished
delight
the
loaves
of
bread
thrown
to
them
by
the
jolly
beggars
of
the
sea
and
nearly
choked
themselves
to
death
trying
to
swallow
huge
mouthfuls
without
even
chewing
them
gysbert
waited
impatiently
on
the
fortress
till
he
saw
the
familiar
lugger
of
joris
fruytiers
come
into
view
and
then
ran
down
and
climbed
aboard
her
words
can
not
describe
the
meeting
between
himself
and
jacqueline
who
during
that
night
of
terror
and
uncertainty
had
given
him
up
for
dead
they
had
much
to
tell
each
other
but
little
time
to
give
to
it
for
old
captain
joris
demanded
at
once
the
whole
history
of
gysbert
night
and
was
loud
in
the
praise
of
his
bravery
when
the
last
vessel
had
entered
the
gates
stanch
admiral
boisot
stood
on
the
deck
of
his
and
made
a
speech
to
the
assembled
crowds
he
ended
by
saying
that
both
the
city
and
the
sea
beggars
had
much
to
thank
god
for
and
proposed
that
they
all
proceed
to
the
great
cathedral
of
peter
to
render
their
praise
to
the
god
of
battles
at
once
then
many
remembered
what
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
they
had
quite
forgotten
that
the
day
was
sunday
with
the
admiral
at
their
head
they
marched
in
solid
ranks
down
the
breede
straat
and
entered
the
cathedral
reverently
shall
we
go
questioned
gysbert
of
his
sister
or
dost
thou
think
we
had
best
go
straight
home
first
no
answered
jacqueline
i
think
god
worship
claims
us
before
all
else
and
they
entered
the
church
with
the
rest
only
a
suffering
lately
besieged
and
recently
delivered
people
could
have
rendered
such
thanks
as
rose
up
to
god
throne
from
that
day
there
were
sounds
of
suppressed
sobbing
all
through
the
congregation
and
strong
men
eyes
grew
moist
when
the
clergyman
read
that
men
would
praise
the
lord
for
his
goodness
and
for
his
wonderful
works
to
the
children
of
men
cried
unto
the
lord
in
their
trouble
and
he
saved
them
out
of
their
distresses
he
satisfieth
the
longing
soul
and
filleth
the
hungry
with
good
things
brought
them
out
of
darkness
and
the
shadow
of
death
he
brake
their
bands
in
sunder
he
commandeth
and
raiseth
the
stormy
wind
which
lifteth
up
the
waves
give
thanks
unto
the
lord
for
he
is
good
for
his
mercy
endureth
forever
then
the
congregation
rose
and
every
voice
joined
in
their
a
mighty
fortress
is
our
god
a
bulwark
never
failing
our
helper
he
amid
the
flood
of
mortal
ills
prevailing
for
still
our
ancient
foe
doth
seek
to
work
us
woe
his
craft
and
power
are
great
and
armed
with
cruel
hate
on
earth
is
not
his
equal
but
in
the
midst
of
the
second
verse
a
general
emotion
checked
the
volume
of
sound
one
by
one
the
voices
failed
till
at
last
the
whole
vast
multitude
broke
down
and
wept
like
children
out
of
the
great
thankfulness
for
their
deliverance
in
their
corner
by
a
window
gysbert
openly
sobbed
with
his
head
on
his
arm
and
jacqueline
stood
with
the
tears
raining
down
her
face
and
the
glad
light
of
happiness
in
her
eyes
come
she
said
when
the
service
was
over
we
must
hasten
at
once
to
vrouw
voorhaas
i
have
sad
misgivings
that
all
is
not
well
with
her
they
had
however
gone
but
a
few
steps
when
they
heard
a
shout
behind
them
and
turning
they
beheld
pieter
de
witt
beckoning
to
them
and
running
as
fast
as
he
could
come
seizing
gysbert
he
hugged
him
distractedly
and
he
squeezed
jacqueline
hand
till
she
almost
screamed
aloud
you
blessed
blessed
children
he
shouted
i
never
supposed
i
should
see
you
again
ah
this
will
indeed
old
jan
and
even
vrouw
voorhaas
may
but
come
and
he
rushed
them
along
so
fast
that
jacqueline
could
hardly
find
breath
in
which
to
ask
after
the
sick
woman
she
is
very
very
low
panted
de
witt
we
hardly
expect
her
to
live
through
the
day
but
the
sight
of
you
two
may
make
some
difference
i
can
not
tell
hurry
hurry
they
reached
belfry
lane
stopped
a
moment
to
regain
breath
and
all
three
crept
upstairs
as
softly
as
possible
the
opened
door
revealed
a
strange
sight
to
their
astonished
gaze
jan
stood
huddled
in
a
corner
eyes
wide
with
amazement
apprehension
and
doubt
vrouw
voorhaas
withered
and
shrunken
by
her
long
illness
half
sat
up
in
her
bed
looking
more
like
a
ghost
than
a
living
being
but
most
astonishing
of
all
over
her
leaned
a
stranger
a
tall
gaunt
man
clad
in
the
uniform
of
the
beggars
of
the
sea
he
bent
over
the
woman
clasping
her
hand
and
questioning
her
anxiously
in
a
low
voice
her
face
was
lined
with
despair
and
her
words
though
faint
were
audible
to
the
listeners
at
the
door
gone
gone
not
here
suddenly
she
raised
her
head
and
saw
the
newcomers
with
a
great
happy
cry
she
pointed
to
them
they
are
here
they
are
safe
i
have
fulfilled
my
duty
praise
god
and
she
fell
back
unconscious
on
the
pillow
the
secret
out
chapter
xix
the
secret
out
de
witt
flew
to
vrouw
voorhaas
assistance
pushing
the
stranger
unceremoniously
aside
in
his
haste
for
a
moment
no
one
spoke
while
he
busied
himself
over
the
sick
woman
then
he
turned
to
the
intruder
sternly
inquiring
who
art
thou
and
why
art
thou
here
the
man
pulled
off
his
cap
ornamented
with
the
beggar
crescent
and
drew
himself
up
to
face
the
physician
i
am
cornellisen
he
said
and
i
have
come
to
claim
my
children
struck
dumb
with
amazement
and
incredulity
not
a
soul
moved
then
de
witt
advanced
a
step
and
stuttered
but
cornellisen
is
dead
no
he
is
not
dead
answered
the
stranger
he
never
died
but
there
was
excellent
reason
why
he
should
be
considered
so
come
children
will
you
not
kiss
your
father
and
he
held
out
his
arms
to
the
two
then
the
spell
was
broken
doubting
no
longer
jacqueline
and
gysbert
rushed
into
his
embrace
while
jan
blubbered
in
his
joy
like
a
great
baby
and
de
witt
tore
around
the
room
alternately
laughing
and
crying
and
trying
to
shake
hands
with
jan
the
confusion
lasted
many
minutes
during
which
time
vrouw
voorhaas
came
unassisted
to
her
senses
and
smiled
understandingly
on
the
scene
oh
my
boy
and
girl
said
the
father
at
last
god
has
brought
us
through
many
strange
trials
and
vicissitudes
to
the
happiness
of
this
meeting
but
now
if
it
pleases
him
we
shall
never
part
again
but
father
answered
jacqueline
we
can
scarcely
yet
realize
that
thou
art
our
father
so
much
dost
thou
seem
like
one
risen
from
the
dead
wilt
thou
not
tell
us
the
whole
story
i
will
indeed
daughter
and
right
here
and
now
since
it
must
seem
passing
strange
to
you
all
they
sat
down
to
listen
breathlessly
while
cornellisen
began
his
story
as
the
tale
unfolded
it
revealed
many
things
to
them
that
had
long
been
hidden
in
mystery
jacqueline
here
must
remember
he
commenced
the
time
when
i
mysteriously
disappeared
six
year
ago
and
so
must
thou
de
witt
for
now
i
recognize
thy
face
and
thank
thee
for
thy
devotion
to
me
and
mine
well
as
you
all
know
the
young
count
de
buren
was
cunningly
enticed
away
from
the
university
of
louvain
by
king
philip
orders
to
be
taken
to
spain
and
either
killed
outright
or
kept
as
a
hostage
he
was
only
a
boy
of
thirteen
and
they
flattered
and
cajoled
him
with
fine
promises
count
de
chassy
had
been
sent
from
spain
with
a
retinue
under
the
pretext
of
escorting
the
young
count
on
a
visit
to
his
majesty
philip
ii
the
boy
was
under
my
special
care
and
i
counselled
him
strongly
not
to
accept
these
doubtful
honors
but
the
child
was
uncontrollable
in
his
desire
to
have
his
own
way
and
before
i
could
get
word
to
the
prince
of
orange
the
start
was
made
young
de
buren
was
to
travel
in
state
though
secretly
he
had
a
retinue
of
two
pages
two
valets
a
cook
and
an
accountant
and
moreover
insisted
that
i
should
go
with
him
as
a
personal
companion
i
was
nothing
loath
to
do
so
for
i
thought
i
might
thus
be
able
to
shield
him
from
harm
my
presence
however
was
not
relished
by
the
spanish
envoys
but
at
first
they
thought
it
best
not
to
oppose
the
boy
wish
we
reached
the
borders
of
spain
and
camped
one
night
in
a
little
mountain
village
as
the
evening
was
fine
i
determined
to
take
a
short
stroll
before
retiring
on
reaching
a
lonely
spot
i
was
set
upon
by
a
masked
man
overpowered
stabbed
in
the
ribs
dragged
into
the
bushes
and
left
for
dead
i
know
now
that
my
assailant
was
dirk
willumhoog
and
that
he
had
been
hired
to
kill
me
at
this
familiar
name
the
children
gasped
next
morning
the
calvacade
passed
on
without
me
telling
the
boy
i
had
left
in
the
night
to
return
to
louvain
but
dirk
thrust
had
not
quite
reached
its
mark
i
was
picked
up
next
day
by
some
peasants
carefully
tended
for
weeks
and
at
last
was
as
well
as
ever
i
was
of
course
perfectly
unknown
to
them
and
remained
so
in
the
meantime
i
had
decided
on
a
plan
i
communicated
with
vrouw
voorhaas
told
her
to
sell
the
house
take
you
children
and
go
to
live
in
leyden
she
was
to
carefully
conceal
the
fact
that
i
was
alive
and
bring
you
children
up
in
her
good
care
till
i
should
return
i
knew
that
you
would
be
more
than
safe
in
her
excellent
keeping
but
i
never
dreamed
that
my
term
of
absence
would
be
so
long
at
the
same
time
i
wrote
to
the
prince
of
orange
who
was
almost
distracted
for
the
safety
of
his
son
i
told
him
what
had
happened
and
also
that
i
intended
to
disguise
myself
as
a
dutch
malcontent
or
glipper
under
the
name
of
leonidus
graafzoon
and
obtain
entrance
to
the
court
of
spain
there
i
could
remain
for
a
time
and
watch
over
the
fortunes
of
the
young
boy
so
cruelly
enticed
into
the
midst
of
his
father
enemies
the
prince
wrote
back
that
by
so
doing
i
would
earn
his
eternal
gratitude
and
procured
me
letters
of
introduction
to
the
spanish
court
under
my
assumed
name
there
i
remained
for
five
years
carefully
guarding
the
safety
of
the
count
at
the
end
of
that
time
however
it
became
apparent
that
they
contemplated
no
harm
toward
young
de
buren
he
was
systematically
carefully
educated
and
seemed
rather
to
like
his
new
surroundings
than
otherwise
i
had
of
course
been
most
anxious
to
be
reunited
with
my
family
and
begged
the
prince
to
free
me
from
my
duties
and
allow
me
to
join
you
he
gave
a
hearty
and
gracious
consent
and
i
began
my
preparations
to
return
to
leyden
when
the
news
of
the
siege
reached
me
and
i
knew
that
great
and
imminent
danger
threatened
you
i
left
spain
as
i
learned
later
not
a
day
too
soon
for
my
old
enemy
dirk
willumhoog
had
in
some
way
discovered
my
secret
unearthed
all
my
past
history
and
was
hot
upon
a
little
scheme
of
his
own
vrouw
voorhaas
sent
me
word
it
was
the
last
i
heard
from
her
that
a
man
whom
she
described
as
dirk
called
on
her
one
day
when
you
both
were
out
informed
her
that
he
knew
her
secret
and
who
you
children
were
and
all
about
me
then
he
tried
to
bribe
her
to
give
you
up
to
him
offering
a
good
round
sum
in
gold
when
she
refused
he
threatened
to
get
possession
of
you
in
some
other
way
she
was
wild
with
anxiety
for
your
safety
and
begged
me
to
hasten
to
leyden
without
delay
but
by
the
time
i
reached
holland
the
siege
was
in
full
progress
and
all
thought
of
access
to
the
city
was
hopeless
having
thus
a
double
reason
for
serving
the
city
i
went
to
zeeland
and
joined
the
sea
beggars
i
fought
all
the
way
to
leyden
on
the
of
and
have
been
frequently
almost
prostrated
by
the
alternations
of
hope
and
despair
but
i
am
here
we
are
reunited
and
now
you
know
my
story
yes
said
jacqueline
with
a
breath
but
i
still
do
not
see
why
dirk
wished
to
get
possession
of
gysbert
and
myself
why
dost
thou
not
comprehend
interrupted
the
boy
he
wanted
to
hold
us
for
a
ransom
well
knowing
father
would
pay
any
price
to
have
us
back
dost
thou
not
remember
how
we
overheard
him
telling
vrouw
hansleer
that
we
would
surely
mean
more
money
to
them
and
that
is
why
they
were
so
careful
of
us
too
yes
said
cornellisen
that
is
what
he
wanted
with
you
but
now
i
must
hear
your
story
too
how
came
vrouw
voorhaas
to
think
she
had
lost
you
the
children
recounted
their
adventures
first
one
and
then
the
other
interrupting
in
a
breathless
excited
fashion
at
last
gysbert
ended
with
the
recital
of
the
singular
adventure
of
the
night
before
and
the
terrible
falling
of
the
wall
just
after
dirk
willumhoog
had
entered
the
breach
it
doubtless
became
his
tomb
remarked
cornellisen
thoughtfully
and
a
terrible
ending
indeed
too
terrible
to
linger
over
no
no
interrupted
old
jan
eagerly
it
was
but
just
just
was
he
not
about
to
betray
the
city
for
filthy
spanish
gold
and
does
it
not
fulfil
every
word
of
that
verse
from
the
scriptures
the
snare
which
the
wicked
hath
set
is
his
own
foot
taken
the
bible
says
also
not
that
ye
be
not
judged
said
cornellisen
quietly
so
we
will
leave
dirk
willumhoog
forever
as
he
has
gone
to
face
his
sentence
in
a
higher
court
than
any
human
one
presently
de
witt
made
a
sign
to
old
jan
and
the
two
crept
quietly
out
together
leaving
the
happy
family
alone
for
a
while
in
their
new
joy
of
glad
reunion
the
great
day
chapter
xx
the
great
day
four
months
had
passed
since
the
lifting
of
the
great
siege
of
leyden
no
sooner
had
the
spaniards
effected
their
retreat
than
the
gales
shifted
the
wind
changed
to
the
east
the
sea
retreated
and
left
the
waters
to
drain
from
the
sodden
fields
in
due
time
the
work
of
reconstructing
the
dykes
commenced
and
the
exhausted
city
once
more
lifted
up
its
head
smiling
to
meet
its
renewal
of
life
no
one
rejoiced
more
over
the
wonderful
victory
than
did
the
prince
of
orange
and
to
express
his
gratitude
to
the
citizens
for
their
enduring
heroism
during
all
the
long
weary
months
he
determined
to
present
the
city
with
a
gift
this
gift
was
one
more
highly
valued
by
the
dutch
than
anything
else
it
was
in
his
power
to
bestow
for
it
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
accordingly
the
university
of
leyden
destined
in
after
years
to
be
so
illustrious
was
endowed
with
a
rich
sum
of
money
and
provided
with
professors
and
instructors
the
most
learned
and
distinguished
in
all
the
netherlands
among
these
was
cornellisen
whose
valuable
personal
services
the
prince
was
never
weary
of
praising
william
of
orange
declared
that
a
professorship
was
all
too
poor
a
reward
for
such
devotion
but
the
doctor
would
accept
of
no
other
vowing
that
his
ambition
was
completely
satisfied
in
being
connected
with
such
a
wonderful
institution
of
learning
on
the
fifth
of
february
all
preparations
being
completed
the
solemn
ceremony
of
consecrating
the
university
was
to
take
place
it
was
to
be
a
great
day
and
the
whole
city
was
on
of
expectation
in
consequence
the
weather
was
perfect
and
even
though
so
early
in
the
year
the
atmosphere
had
a
flavor
the
canals
were
packed
with
gay
barges
houses
flaunted
in
bunting
and
floral
decorations
and
a
festive
air
was
prevalent
in
every
quarter
of
the
city
at
seven
in
the
morning
there
was
a
solemn
ceremony
of
consecration
in
the
great
church
of
peter
jacqueline
and
gysbert
could
not
but
think
of
another
scene
in
this
same
church
only
four
months
before
but
how
different
there
was
no
weeping
now
all
the
new
professors
filed
in
and
took
their
places
in
the
chancel
looking
very
grand
and
imposing
in
their
flowing
robes
and
decorations
look
look
vrouw
voorhaas
there
is
father
whispered
gysbert
pulling
her
sleeve
and
the
faithful
woman
now
quite
recovered
from
her
long
illness
nodded
and
smiled
approvingly
the
impressive
service
continued
ending
with
the
singing
of
the
famous
hymn
a
mighty
fortress
is
our
god
but
this
time
the
joyful
anthem
was
interrupted
by
no
sobs
of
overwrought
emotion
as
on
that
memorable
sunday
when
leyden
was
saved
then
came
a
gorgeous
procession
up
the
wide
breede
straat
it
moved
slowly
and
majestically
under
great
triumphal
arches
and
over
pavements
strewn
with
flowers
first
there
was
a
grand
military
escort
in
which
adrian
van
der
werf
the
brave
and
loyal
burgomaster
rode
at
the
head
of
his
company
of
burgher
guards
this
was
followed
by
glittering
chariots
and
wonderfully
arrayed
figures
representing
justice
peace
the
four
gospels
and
many
mythological
and
allegorical
characters
but
in
the
midst
of
these
there
was
a
little
break
and
then
appeared
riding
on
a
horse
a
fair
young
girl
her
beautiful
golden
hair
floated
all
about
her
she
was
clothed
in
a
long
trailing
robe
of
white
silk
and
on
one
shoulder
sat
a
glistening
pigeon
fastened
to
her
by
a
small
golden
chain
she
represented
and
carried
a
garland
of
healing
herbs
in
one
hand
as
she
passed
through
the
crowds
a
great
cry
went
up
jacqueline
jacqueline
of
the
carrier
pigeons
for
all
recognized
her
as
the
sweet
unselfish
girl
who
had
done
and
risked
so
much
in
the
terrible
days
of
the
plague
and
siege
and
not
a
few
were
also
acquainted
with
the
remarkable
story
of
her
father
return
it
was
a
proud
moment
in
her
life
but
she
bore
herself
with
the
ease
of
entire
unconsciousness
for
her
thoughts
were
on
the
honor
of
the
university
and
not
on
herself
last
in
the
procession
came
the
professors
and
instructors
and
the
whole
passed
through
every
prominent
street
of
the
city
till
it
came
to
the
cloister
of
saint
barbara
the
place
prepared
for
the
new
university
here
there
was
a
long
address
by
the
reverend
casper
kolhas
orator
of
the
day
and
later
on
a
magnificent
banquet
it
was
nightfall
before
all
was
over
and
the
tired
participants
returned
to
their
various
homes
in
a
fine
roomy
house
on
the
marendorfstrasse
the
new
quarters
of
the
cornellisen
family
gysbert
and
jacqueline
waited
to
bid
their
father
when
his
social
duties
at
last
permitted
him
to
come
to
the
children
he
entered
the
room
and
they
gathered
about
him
to
talk
it
all
over
before
going
to
bed
i
am
proud
of
my
children
said
cornellisen
proud
of
thee
jacqueline
because
thou
hast
borne
thyself
with
so
much
grace
and
dignity
during
a
difficult
day
proud
of
thee
gysbert
because
thou
didst
not
complain
of
having
no
prominent
part
in
the
parade
although
thy
services
to
the
city
during
the
siege
were
really
most
praiseworthy
and
now
i
am
going
to
tell
thee
that
the
prince
wished
me
to
allow
thee
to
ride
on
a
float
all
by
thyself
dressed
as
thou
wert
on
the
morning
of
october
third
with
the
pot
of
at
thy
side
eyes
opened
wide
at
this
but
i
would
not
permit
it
went
on
his
father
thou
art
yet
too
young
to
take
so
prominent
a
part
and
i
did
not
think
it
best
for
thee
but
to
make
up
for
this
i
am
going
to
allow
thee
in
addition
to
studying
in
the
university
to
take
a
course
in
art
under
the
very
finest
master
that
can
be
procured
does
that
please
thee
son
father
father
answered
the
boy
and
his
voice
trembled
with
the
intensity
of
his
feeling
i
know
naught
in
all
this
world
that
would
please
me
so
much
and
as
for
thee
jacqueline
said
the
doctor
turning
to
her
since
thou
hast
shown
thyself
so
proficient
in
the
healing
art
and
de
witt
tells
me
thou
didst
do
wonders
during
the
plague
i
shall
give
thee
a
special
course
under
my
own
tuition
in
the
university
thou
mayst
not
ever
become
a
titled
physician
that
not
being
exactly
a
woman
work
but
at
least
thou
shalt
have
all
the
understanding
of
one
daughter
i
trust
that
makes
thee
happy
jacqueline
did
not
answer
in
words
but
she
put
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
laid
her
soft
cheek
against
his
own
and
her
father
understood
and
now
let
us
call
in
vrouw
voorhaas
and
jan
cried
gysbert
and
tell
them
the
good
news
vrouw
voorhaas
expressed
her
approval
in
her
own
quiet
way
and
jan
who
now
occupied
a
trusted
position
in
the
household
shouted
hurrah
like
a
boy
in
the
midst
of
this
rejoicing
de
witt
dropped
in
on
his
way
home
from
the
burgomaster
and
let
me
tell
you
all
something
else
he
added
when
he
had
been
informed
of
the
children
good
fortune
mynheer
van
der
werf
has
been
commissioned
by
the
prince
in
the
name
of
the
city
to
buy
all
thy
juffrouw
jacqueline
that
were
used
during
the
siege
preserve
them
carefully
while
they
live
and
have
them
stuffed
and
placed
in
the
leyden
museum
when
they
die
likewise
he
undertakes
to
buy
thy
pot
gysbert
for
a
good
round
sum
and
place
that
also
in
the
museum
so
i
suppose
you
will
both
have
to
make
up
your
minds
to
part
with
these
cherished
possessions
i
only
too
glad
to
part
with
mine
said
gysbert
for
i
shall
be
proud
to
go
and
look
at
that
old
iron
pot
in
its
honored
place
in
the
museum
and
think
how
i
found
it
that
horrible
night
and
how
good
the
spanish
tasted
that
i
got
out
of
it
and
i
said
jacqueline
will
give
up
my
pigeons
since
the
prince
wishes
it
but
i
think
i
will
keep
of
orange
for
myself
he
rode
with
me
in
the
procession
and
i
love
him
both
for
the
name
he
bears
and
the
part
he
played
in
those
dreadful
days
no
i
am
sure
i
can
not
part
with
my
faithful
of
orange
but
the
future
was
to
hold
one
more
for
the
cornellisen
family
at
which
we
must
have
one
glimpse
before
we
leave
them
five
years
more
had
passed
and
again
it
was
october
third
the
anniversary
of
the
great
relief
of
leyden
the
day
was
always
set
apart
as
one
of
feasting
and
general
thanksgiving
and
a
holiday
air
pervaded
the
city
but
in
the
cornellisen
home
were
preparations
of
quite
another
character
for
it
was
the
wedding
day
of
jacqueline
grown
into
a
fair
and
noble
womanhood
was
this
same
jacqueline
of
splendid
promise
who
had
so
bravely
discharged
what
seemed
to
her
the
highest
duty
in
the
days
of
the
memorable
siege
she
was
going
to
marry
loyal
pieter
de
witt
who
had
learned
to
love
her
in
the
terrible
days
when
they
tended
the
starving
and
together
patiently
had
he
waited
and
watched
her
grow
to
be
a
sweet
unselfish
woman
then
he
had
courted
and
won
her
and
she
stood
ready
to
become
his
wife
no
prettier
bride
could
have
possibly
been
imagined
than
jacqueline
as
she
stood
robed
in
her
vrouw
voorhaas
hovered
over
her
lovingly
giving
the
last
tender
anxious
touches
to
the
array
of
her
beloved
charge
presently
the
door
opened
and
gysbert
laughingly
demanded
admission
gysbert
no
longer
a
little
lad
of
fourteen
but
a
tall
fine
youth
of
nineteen
he
entered
at
his
sister
bidding
and
surveyed
her
admiringly
from
top
to
toe
thou
art
perfect
my
jacqueline
but
no
one
knows
how
i
hate
to
part
with
thee
even
to
pieter
whom
i
do
certainly
love
but
thou
art
not
parting
with
me
gysbert
are
we
not
going
to
stay
right
here
with
thee
and
father
i
shall
be
with
thee
as
much
as
ever
well
i
suppose
that
is
true
after
all
i
am
only
gaining
a
brother
by
this
but
dost
thou
remember
jacqueline
how
we
used
to
talk
over
our
ambitions
up
there
on
hengist
hill
i
am
in
a
fair
way
to
gain
mine
for
what
dost
thou
think
karel
van
mander
told
father
that
i
bid
fair
to
become
a
great
artist
if
i
persevere
and
he
is
the
greatest
himself
in
the
netherlands
at
the
present
time
and
then
the
prince
of
orange
admired
and
purchased
my
last
picture
and
has
promised
to
hang
it
in
his
salon
in
the
but
what
of
great
ambition
sister
ah
she
answered
laughingly
i
have
studied
medicine
till
i
have
it
at
my
finger
ends
i
am
the
daughter
of
one
physician
and
am
about
to
become
the
wife
of
another
what
more
can
i
ask
i
am
content
gysbert
but
is
it
not
splendid
said
the
boy
that
the
prince
is
to
be
present
at
the
wedding
thou
art
much
honored
jacqueline
and
i
am
wild
to
see
him
again
he
is
still
my
hero
and
ideal
thou
hast
not
yet
seen
the
present
he
sent
added
jacqueline
it
came
but
a
short
time
ago
look
she
held
out
her
arm
and
exhibited
a
beautiful
bracelet
set
with
many
pearls
in
the
center
was
a
small
gold
plate
on
which
was
engraved
to
jacqueline
of
the
carrier
pigeons
from
william
of
in
memory
of
faithful
services
in
leyden
i
prize
this
more
than
aught
else
i
received
she
said
softly
then
in
came
jan
brave
in
wedding
finery
to
have
a
last
intimate
view
of
his
jacqueline
round
and
round
her
he
walked
speechless
with
admiration
and
could
only
smile
and
chuckle
and
rub
his
hands
and
stroke
her
dainty
garments
with
touches
last
of
all
came
her
father
in
his
scholarly
robes
of
the
university
and
took
her
in
his
arms
for
a
final
caress
thou
art
sweet
and
fair
my
darling
he
whispered
be
as
good
a
wife
to
pieter
as
thou
hast
been
ever
a
daughter
to
me
and
heaven
itself
could
ask
no
more
but
come
the
prince
and
his
suite
have
arrived
the
guests
are
all
assembled
and
thy
future
husband
waits
to
claim
thee
and
so
to
the
sound
of
merry
wedding
music
we
say
farewell
to
jacqueline
of
the
carrier
pigeons
the
end
