one
stormy
night
mother
we
afloat
agin
it
was
a
gruff
sleepy
voice
that
spoke
and
the
old
fisherman
turned
over
and
snored
on
as
though
the
fact
of
their
home
being
afloat
was
of
no
consequence
to
him
his
wife
however
was
by
no
means
so
easy
in
her
mind
for
it
was
only
during
the
equinoctial
gales
and
an
unusually
high
tide
that
their
home
was
lifted
from
its
moorings
and
now
it
had
been
swinging
and
swaying
for
hours
and
the
rusty
chains
that
held
it
fast
to
some
posts
were
creaking
and
straining
as
though
the
next
gust
of
wind
would
certainly
carry
them
out
to
sea
or
drive
them
up
the
river
where
they
would
inevitably
be
swamped
in
a
very
short
time
for
their
was
leaky
at
the
bottom
had
been
a
boat
before
the
fisherman
took
possession
of
it
and
turned
it
into
a
cottage
by
running
up
some
wooden
walls
along
the
sides
and
roofing
it
in
with
planks
and
tarpaulin
thus
converted
into
a
the
boat
had
been
secured
by
four
chains
fixed
to
posts
in
the
ground
on
the
top
of
a
that
formed
the
boundary
of
the
mouth
of
the
river
the
ocean
itself
was
less
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
where
the
old
boat
was
moored
and
so
the
poor
woman
might
well
be
excused
for
growing
more
alarmed
as
the
minutes
went
on
and
the
gale
increased
until
the
boat
fairly
rocked
and
the
children
in
the
adjoining
cabin
began
crying
and
screaming
in
their
fright
coomber
coomber
she
said
at
last
shaking
her
husband
and
starting
up
in
bed
for
a
sound
more
dreadful
than
the
children
screams
had
made
itself
heard
above
the
din
of
the
wind
and
waves
there
a
ship
coomber
close
in
shore
i
can
hear
the
guns
screamed
his
wife
giving
him
another
vigorous
shake
ship
guns
exclaimed
the
old
fisherman
starting
up
in
bed
the
next
minute
he
was
on
his
feet
and
working
himself
into
his
clothes
she
must
be
on
the
if
you
heard
the
guns
he
said
a
sudden
lurch
of
the
boat
almost
pitched
the
old
man
forward
and
the
children
screams
redoubled
while
coomber
hastily
scrambled
out
of
bed
and
lighted
the
lantern
that
hung
against
the
wall
what
are
yer
going
to
do
asked
her
husband
in
some
surprise
women
ai
no
good
in
such
work
as
this
what
are
you
going
to
do
asked
coomber
almost
crying
herself
the
boat
will
soon
be
adrift
with
this
wind
and
tide
and
we
shall
all
be
drowned
like
rats
in
a
hole
nay
nay
old
woman
the
boat
was
made
taut
enough
before
i
brought
you
here
and
you
think
she
would
have
broke
away
before
this
if
she
was
going
to
do
it
do
be
a
stupid
lubber
he
added
but
the
children
coomber
the
children
i
ai
afraid
for
myself
said
the
mother
with
a
sob
well
well
the
old
boat
hold
the
boys
for
many
a
day
yet
said
the
fisherman
you
go
in
and
stop
their
noise
while
i
get
help
for
the
poor
souls
that
are
surely
perishing
out
there
but
what
can
you
do
for
them
asked
his
wife
there
ai
a
boat
besides
ours
at
bermuda
point
nor
a
man
to
help
you
manage
it
besides
bob
no
no
bob
and
i
could
manage
the
boat
in
such
a
sea
as
this
but
he
shall
go
with
me
to
fellness
bob
bob
called
his
father
in
the
same
breath
aye
aye
came
an
answering
shout
from
the
adjoining
cabin
slip
into
your
things
as
quick
as
you
can
we
must
be
off
to
fellness
there
a
ship
out
there
on
the
bar
sands
i
ready
dad
i
heard
mother
call
yer
and
thought
you
let
me
go
along
replied
bob
before
the
fisherman
put
on
his
he
took
a
black
bottle
from
a
recess
and
after
taking
a
hearty
draught
he
said
it
lucky
got
a
drop
as
he
handed
it
to
his
wife
and
with
a
parting
word
to
her
not
to
be
afraid
he
and
bob
stepped
out
of
the
door
to
meet
the
full
fury
of
the
blast
that
threatened
at
first
to
carry
them
off
their
legs
the
three
miles
walk
to
the
little
fishing
village
of
fellness
was
no
easy
task
such
a
wild
night
as
this
for
although
the
road
was
inland
it
was
fully
exposed
to
the
sea
and
between
the
wilder
outbreaks
of
the
wind
and
rain
they
could
hear
the
guns
of
distress
and
occasionally
see
a
rocket
piercing
the
midnight
blackness
of
the
sky
appealing
for
help
for
the
drowning
men
at
the
coastguard
station
midway
between
the
point
and
the
village
they
found
the
men
on
the
alert
and
two
volunteered
to
go
with
coomber
and
help
man
the
boat
then
the
four
plodded
silently
along
the
slushy
road
for
talking
was
next
to
impossible
in
such
a
gale
and
it
needed
all
the
strength
and
energy
they
could
muster
to
fight
the
wind
and
rain
they
made
their
way
to
the
beach
as
soon
as
they
reached
fellness
and
as
they
expected
found
most
of
the
men
gathered
there
watching
the
distressed
vessel
halloo
here
coomber
from
the
point
said
one
as
the
pushed
their
way
in
among
them
what
are
yer
standing
here
for
shouted
coomber
in
some
impatience
looking
wo
do
her
no
good
we
ca
do
nothing
else
said
the
man
we
got
rodwell
boat
here
she
the
best
craft
on
this
coast
for
such
a
trip
and
we
made
three
tries
in
her
but
it
no
good
nothing
could
live
in
such
a
sea
as
this
we
been
beat
back
every
time
and
swamped
well
mates
i
do
say
nothing
but
what
yer
may
have
tried
but
suppose
now
one
of
yer
had
got
a
boy
out
in
that
there
ship
got
a
boy
in
that
or
another
if
he
ai
gone
to
where
there
no
more
sea
said
the
old
fisherman
with
a
groan
and
before
he
had
done
speaking
one
or
two
had
moved
to
where
the
boat
had
been
dragged
on
to
the
low
sandy
shore
we
try
again
they
said
in
quiet
but
determined
voices
let
the
youngsters
go
said
coomber
as
two
or
three
married
men
pressed
forward
them
as
has
got
wives
ai
no
call
to
go
on
such
a
trip
as
this
there
be
enough
of
us
there
me
and
bob
and
rook
and
white
came
with
us
a
purpose
and
but
how
about
your
wife
coomber
interrupted
one
of
the
men
oh
never
you
fear
lads
she
not
grudge
me
if
i
save
her
boy
now
lads
look
here
seven
of
us
be
enough
and
we
got
four
there
were
so
many
volunteers
for
the
three
vacant
places
that
the
men
seemed
on
the
point
of
quarrelling
among
themselves
now
for
the
privilege
of
joining
in
this
dangerous
errand
but
by
common
consent
coomber
was
constituted
the
leader
of
the
party
and
he
chose
three
of
the
most
stalwart
of
the
single
men
and
the
rest
were
allowed
to
run
the
boat
down
through
the
surf
then
with
a
loud
cheer
from
all
who
stood
on
the
shore
the
seven
brave
men
bent
to
their
oars
and
during
a
slight
lull
in
the
wind
they
made
a
little
headway
towards
the
wreck
but
the
next
minute
they
were
beaten
back
again
and
the
boat
swamped
again
they
pushed
off
but
again
were
they
driven
back
and
five
times
was
this
repeated
and
thus
an
hour
was
lost
in
the
fruitless
endeavour
to
get
away
from
the
shore
at
length
the
fury
of
the
storm
somewhat
abated
and
they
were
able
to
get
away
but
it
was
a
long
time
before
they
could
get
near
the
dangerous
bar
sands
on
which
the
vessel
had
struck
and
when
they
did
get
there
the
ship
had
disappeared
there
was
plenty
of
wreckage
about
broken
spars
fragments
of
masts
and
torn
we
too
late
groaned
one
of
the
men
as
he
peered
through
the
darkness
trying
to
descry
the
hull
of
the
vessel
they
had
not
heard
the
guns
or
seen
a
rocket
thrown
up
for
some
time
they
all
gone
poor
fellows
said
another
sadly
we
may
as
well
go
back
now
before
the
gale
freshens
again
oh
stop
a
bit
we
look
among
this
rubbish
and
see
what
there
is
here
perhaps
some
of
them
are
holding
on
to
the
floating
timber
said
coomber
who
had
frequently
been
out
on
a
similar
errand
they
raised
their
voices
together
and
cried
hi
hi
trying
to
outscream
the
wind
but
it
was
of
no
use
there
was
no
answering
call
for
help
and
after
waiting
about
for
some
time
and
going
as
near
to
the
dangerous
sands
as
they
dared
they
at
length
reluctantly
turned
their
boat
towards
the
shore
and
began
to
row
back
but
before
they
had
got
far
on
their
way
they
descried
the
gleam
of
something
white
floating
in
front
of
them
only
a
bit
of
said
one
as
they
paused
in
their
rowing
to
concentrate
all
their
attention
upon
the
object
let
make
sure
mates
said
coomber
steady
now
mind
your
oars
let
her
float
it
coming
this
way
and
we
pick
it
up
and
in
another
minute
coomber
had
reached
over
and
seized
the
white
bundle
which
he
found
to
be
carefully
lashed
to
a
spar
it
a
child
he
exclaimed
mates
we
ai
come
out
for
nothing
after
all
now
row
for
dear
life
he
said
as
he
carefully
laid
the
bundle
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
they
could
do
nothing
for
it
here
not
even
ascertain
whether
it
was
dead
or
alive
and
they
pulled
for
the
shore
with
even
greater
eagerness
than
they
had
left
it
the
dawn
was
breaking
before
they
got
back
and
they
were
welcomed
with
a
shout
from
their
waiting
comrades
who
were
watching
anxiously
for
the
return
of
the
boat
there
was
disappointment
however
in
the
little
crowd
of
watchers
when
they
saw
only
the
brave
crew
returning
from
the
perilous
journey
what
nothing
exclaimed
one
of
the
men
as
the
boat
drew
close
in
shore
only
a
child
and
that
may
be
dead
shouted
one
of
the
crew
but
i
think
it
alive
said
coomber
run
peters
and
rouse
up
your
missus
the
womenfolk
are
better
hands
at
such
jobs
than
we
are
and
as
soon
as
he
could
leave
the
boat
he
picked
up
the
white
bundle
and
hurried
after
peters
leaving
his
companions
to
tell
the
story
of
their
disappointment
peters
was
a
motherly
woman
and
had
already
lighted
a
fire
to
prepare
some
breakfast
for
her
husband
in
readiness
for
his
return
from
the
beach
so
the
wet
clothes
were
soon
taken
off
the
child
and
they
saw
it
was
a
little
girl
about
five
years
old
fair
and
decently
but
not
richly
clad
with
a
small
silver
medal
hung
round
her
neck
by
a
black
ribbon
at
first
they
feared
the
poor
little
thing
was
dead
for
it
was
not
until
peters
had
exhausted
all
her
methods
for
restoring
the
apparently
drowned
that
the
little
waif
showed
any
sign
of
returning
life
coomber
stood
watching
with
silent
but
intense
anxiety
the
efforts
of
the
dame
to
restore
animation
not
daring
to
join
in
the
vigorous
chafings
and
slappings
administered
for
fear
his
rough
horny
hands
should
hurt
the
tender
limbs
for
some
time
the
woman
was
too
much
occupied
with
her
task
to
notice
his
presence
but
when
her
labour
was
rewarded
by
a
faint
sigh
and
a
breath
parted
the
pale
lips
she
heard
a
grunt
of
satisfaction
behind
her
and
turning
her
head
she
exclaimed
what
gowks
men
are
to
be
sure
eh
what
is
it
dame
said
coomber
meekly
for
he
had
conceived
a
wonderful
respect
for
peters
during
the
last
ten
minutes
ha
you
been
there
like
a
post
all
this
while
and
never
put
out
yer
hand
to
help
save
the
child
she
said
reproachingly
i
could
dame
i
could
with
such
hands
as
these
but
i
do
anything
for
you
that
i
can
whispered
the
fisherman
as
though
he
feared
to
disturb
the
child
well
i
want
a
tub
of
hot
water
snapped
peters
you
find
the
tub
in
the
backyard
and
the
kettle
near
on
the
boil
look
sharp
and
get
the
tub
and
then
go
upstairs
and
get
a
blanket
off
the
bed
coomber
soon
brought
the
tub
and
a
pitcher
of
cold
water
that
stood
near
but
it
was
not
so
easy
for
him
to
grope
his
way
upstairs
the
staircase
was
narrow
and
dark
and
seemed
specially
contrived
that
the
uninitiated
might
bump
and
bruise
themselves
coomber
in
his
having
no
such
convenience
or
inconvenience
in
general
use
found
the
ascent
anything
but
easy
and
the
dame
sharp
voice
was
heard
calling
for
the
blanket
long
before
he
had
groped
his
way
to
the
bedroom
door
but
what
would
he
not
do
for
that
child
whose
faint
wail
now
greeted
his
ears
he
pushed
on
in
spite
of
thumps
and
knocks
against
unexpected
corners
and
when
he
had
found
the
blanket
was
not
long
in
making
his
way
down
with
it
now
what
to
be
done
with
her
demanded
the
woman
as
she
lifted
the
little
girl
out
of
the
water
and
wrapped
her
in
the
blanket
wo
she
drink
some
milk
said
coomber
scratching
his
head
helplessly
i
dessay
she
will
presently
but
who
to
keep
her
you
say
there
none
of
the
people
saved
from
the
wreck
to
tell
who
she
belongs
to
no
there
ai
none
of
saved
so
i
think
i
take
her
myself
said
coomber
you
take
her
exclaimed
the
woman
what
will
your
wife
say
do
you
think
to
another
mouth
to
fill
when
there
barely
enough
now
for
what
you
got
four
hearty
boys
who
are
very
sharks
for
eating
well
dame
i
had
a
little
gal
o
my
own
but
ai
likely
to
have
another
unless
i
takes
this
one
said
coomber
with
a
little
more
courage
and
so
i
ai
to
lose
this
chance
for
i
do
want
a
little
gal
oh
that
all
very
well
but
you
ai
no
call
to
take
this
child
that
no
ways
your
own
she
can
go
to
the
workus
you
know
take
her
her
clothes
ai
much
so
her
belongings
likely
to
trouble
themselves
much
about
her
yer
can
see
by
this
trumpery
medal
she
do
belong
to
rich
folks
so
my
advice
is
let
her
go
to
the
workus
where
she
be
well
provided
for
no
no
the
missus
see
things
as
i
do
when
i
talk
to
her
a
bit
so
if
you
take
care
of
her
for
an
hour
or
two
while
i
go
home
and
get
off
these
duds
and
tell
her
about
it
i
be
obliged
and
without
waiting
for
the
dame

spoke
in

reproachful
tone
for

found

the
cowering
children
huddled
together
in

an
comfortable
and
have
a
bit
breakfast
ready
for
a
feller
when
he
comes
home
after
a
tough
job
such
as
i
had
i
i
did
know
when
you
was
coming
to
breakfast
said
coomber
timidly
and
still
keeping
close
in
the
corner
of
the
shed
for
fear
her
husband
should
knock
her
down
while
the
children
stopped
their
mutual
grumblings
and
complaints
and
crept
closer
to
each
other
behind
their
mother
skirts
could
you
ha
got
it
ready
and
waited
wi
a
bit
o
fire
to
dry
these
duds
exclaimed
her
husband
but
the
boat
coomber
it
was
safe
pleaded
the
poor
woman
we
might
ha
been
adrift
any
minute
did
i
tell
yer
she
was
safe
and
did
i
ought
to
know
when
a
boat
safe
better
nor
you
a
poor
tool
of
a
woman
come
out
of
it
he
added
impatiently
turning
away
the
children
wondered
that
nothing
worse
than
hard
words
fell
to
their
share
and
were
somewhat
relieved
that
the
next
question
referred
to
bob
and
not
to
their
doings
you
say
he
ai
come
home
said
coomber
i
ai
seen
him
since
he
went
with
you
to
fellness
ai
you
just
come
from
there
said
his
wife
timidly
of
course
i
have
but
bob
ought
to
have
been
back
an
hour
or
so
ago
for
i
had
something
to
do
in
the
village
come
to
the
boat
and
tell
you
all
about
it
he
added
in
a
less
severe
tone
for
the
thought
of
the
child
he
had
rescued
softened
him
a
little
and
he
led
the
way
out
of
the
the
storm
had
abated
now
and
the
boat
no
longer
rocked
and
swayed
so
that
the
children
waded
back
through
the
mud
without
fear
while
their
father
talked
of
the
little
girl
he
had
left
with
dame
peters
at
fellness
they
listened
to
his
proposal
to
bring
her
home
and
share
their
scanty
meals
with
very
little
pleasure
and
they
wished
their
mother
would
say
she
could
not
have
another
baby
but
instead
of
this
coomber
assented
at
once
to
her
husband
plan
of
fetching
the
child
from
fellness
that
afternoon
the
coombers
were
not
a
happy
family
for
the
fisherman
was
a
stern
hard
man
by
nature
and
since
he
had
lost
his
little
girl
he
had
become
harder
his
neighbours
said
at
all
events
his
wife
and
children
grew
more
afraid
of
him
afraid
of
provoking
his
stern
displeasure
by
any
of
those
little
playful
raids
children
so
delight
in
and
every
one
of
them
looked
forward
to
the
day
when
they
could
run
away
from
home
and
go
to
sea
as
their
brother
had
done
bob
the
eldest
now
at
home
was
already
contemplating
taking
this
step
very
soon
and
had
promised
to
help
dick
and
tom
when
they
were
old
enough
it
had
been
a
startling
revelation
to
bob
to
hear
his
father
speak
as
he
had
done
on
the
beach
at
fellness
about
his
brother
for
he
had
long
ago
decided
that
his
father
did
not
care
a
pin
for
any
of
them
unless
it
was
for
the
baby
sister
who
had
died
and
even
of
that
he
was
not
quite
sure
he
had
made
up
his
mind
as
he
walked
through
the
storm
that
morning
that
he
would
not
go
back
again
but
make
his
way
to
grimsby
or
some
other
seaport
town
after
his
business
at
fellness
was
done
but
what
he
had
heard
on
the
beach
from
his
father
somewhat
shook
his
purpose
and
when
he
learned
from
dame
peters
afterwards
that
the
child
they
had
rescued
was
to
share
their
home
he
thought
he
would
go
back
again
and
try
to
bear
the
hard
life
a
little
longer
if
it
was
only
to
help
his
mother
and
tell
her
his
father
did
care
for
them
a
bit
in
spite
of
his
stern
hard
ways
perhaps
coomber
did
not
need
to
be
told
that
her
husband
loved
her
and
his
children
at
all
events
she
received
bob
information
with
a
nod
and
a
smile
and
a
whispered
word
yer
father
all
right
and
a
rare
good
fisherman
she
said
for
in
spite
of
the
frequent
unkindness
she
experienced
coomber
was
very
fond
of
her
husband
ah
he
a
good
fisherman
but
he
be
all
the
better
if
he
did
have
so
much
of
that
bottle
grumbled
bob
he
thinks
a
deal
more
about
that
than
he
does
about
us
it
was
true
enough
what
bob
said
if
his
father
could
not
by
any
chance
get
his
bottle
replenished
wife
and
children
had
a
little
respite
from
their
usual
hard
driving
life
and
he
was
more
civil
to
their
only
neighbours
who
were
at
the
farm
about
half
a
mile
off
but
once
the
bottle
got
filled
again
he
grew
sullen
and
morose
or
quarrelsome
he
had
recently
made
himself
very
disagreeable
to
farmer
hayes
in
one
of
his
irritable
fits
a
fact
which
suddenly
recurred
to
his
wife
when
she
heard
of
the
sick
child
being
brought
home
to
her
to
nurse
but
she
dared
not
mention
it
to
her
husband
when
coomber
brought
the
child
that
afternoon
he
said
gaily
here
a
present
for
yer
from
the
sea
mother
maybe
she
bring
us
good
luck
coming
as
she
did
it
be
better
luck
if
we
picked
up
a
boat
muttered
bob
who
was
standing
near
why
she
ai
such
a
baby
as
you
said
exclaimed
coomber
as
she
unpinned
the
shawl
in
which
she
was
wrapped
she
is
about
five
five
years
old
repeated
coomber
but
she
talk
if
she
was
as
old
as
that
and
dame
peters
told
me
she
just
laid
like
a
dead
thing
ever
since
she
been
there
she
ill
that
what
it
is
poor
little
mite
ill
and
frightened
out
of
her
senses
and
coomber
gathered
her
in
her
arms
and
kissed
the
little
white
lips
and
pressed
her
to
her
bosom
as
only
a
tender
mother
can
while
the
boys
stood
round
in
wondering
silence
and
coomber
dashed
a
tear
from
his
eye
as
he
thought
of
the
little
daughter
lying
in
fellness
churchyard
but
he
was
ashamed
of
the
love
that
prompted
this
feeling
and
said
hastily
now
mother
we
must
begin
by
spoiling
her
but
then
he
turned
away
and
called
bob
to
go
with
him
and
look
after
the
boat
for
several
days
the
child
continued
very
ill
too
ill
to
notice
anything
or
to
attempt
to
talk
but
one
day
when
she
was
lying
on
coomber
lap
before
the
fire
the
boys
mutely
looking
at
her
as
she
lay
she
suddenly
put
up
her
little
hands
and
said
in
a
feeble
whisper
dear
faver
dod
tate
tare
o
daddy
and
mammy
and
tiny
and
then
she
seemed
to
drop
off
into
a
doze
the
boys
were
startled
and
coomber
looked
down
hastily
at
the
little
form
on
her
lap
for
this
was
the
first
intimation
they
had
had
that
the
child
could
talk
although
coomber
fancied
that
she
had
showed
some
signs
of
recognising
her
during
the
previous
day
i
say
did
you
hear
that
whispered
dick
was
she
saying
her
prayers
mother
like
harry
hayes
does
coomber
nodded
while
she
looked
down
into
the
child
face
and
moved
her
gently
to
and
fro
to
soothe
her
to
sleep
but
mother
ought
she
to
say
that
did
you
hear
her
she
said
god
said
dick
creeping
round
to
his
mother
side
coomber
was
puzzled
herself
at
the
child
words
they
had
awakened
in
her
a
memory
of
days
when
she
was
a
girl
and
knelt
at
her
mother
knee
and
said
our
father
before
she
went
to
bed
but
that
was
long
before
she
had
heard
of
bermuda
point
or
thought
of
having
boys
and
girls
of
her
own
when
they
came
she
had
forgotten
all
about
those
early
days
and
so
they
had
never
been
taught
to
say
their
prayers
or
anything
else
in
fact
except
to
help
their
father
with
the
boat
shoot
in
the
winter
and
gather
samphire
on
the
shore
during
the
summer
she
thought
of
this
now
and
half
wished
she
had
thought
of
it
before
perhaps
if
she
had
tried
to
teach
her
children
to
pray
they
would
have
been
more
of
a
comfort
to
her
perhaps
jack
her
eldest
would
not
have
run
away
from
home
as
he
did
leaving
them
for
years
to
wonder
whether
he
was
alive
or
dead
but
sending
no
word
to
comfort
them
the
boys
were
almost
as
perplexed
as
their
mother
the
little
they
had
heard
of
god
filled
them
with
terror
and
so
to
hear
such
a
prayer
as
this
was
something
so
startling
that
they
could
think
and
talk
of
nothing
else
until
their
father
came
in
when
as
usual
silence
fell
on
the
whole
family
for
coomber
was
in
a
sullen
mood
now
the
next
day
tiny
as
she
had
called
herself
was
decidedly
better
a
little
bed
had
been
made
up
for
her
in
the
family
and
she
lay
there
quiet
but
observant
while
coomber
went
about
her
work
cooking
and
cleaning
and
mending
and
occasionally
stopping
to
kiss
the
little
wistful
face
that
watched
her
with
such
quiet
curiosity
am
i
in
a
now
the
child
asked
at
length
when
coomber
had
kissed
her
several
times
you
in
a
boat
deary
but
you
need
be
afraid
our
boat
is
safe
enough
i
ai
afraid
dod
is
tatin
tare
of
me
said
the
child
with
a
little
sigh
coomber
wondered
whether
she
was
thinking
of
the
storm
whether
she
could
tell
them
who
she
was
and
where
her
friends
might
be
found
and
she
ventured
to
ask
her
several
questions
about
this
but
failed
to
elicit
any
satisfactory
answer
the
child
was
sleepy
or
had
forgotten
what
coomber
thought
she
would
be
sure
to
remember
but
it
was
evident
she
had
taken
notice
of
her
surroundings
during
the
last
few
days
for
after
a
little
while
she
said
where
der
boys
dat
dick
and
tom
coomber
was
amused
they
out
in
the
boat
looking
after
the
nets
she
said
when
they
toming
home
asked
the
little
girl
home
to
dis
boat
i
mean
she
added
oh
they
come
soon
replied
coomber
but
now
ca
you
tell
me
something
about
your
mother
and
father
and
where
you
lived
my
deary
she
asked
again
i
tomed
in
a
and
my
mammy
now
said
the
child
looking
round
the
cosy
room
with
perfect
content
but
where
is
your
own
mammy
who
taught
you
to
say
your
prayers
asked
coomber
the
tears
came
into
the
sweet
blue
eyes
for
a
minute
as
she
said
see
dorn
up
dere
to
tay
in
dod
house
and
tiny
do
too
if
see
a
dood
dal
coomber
laid
down
the
jacket
she
was
patching
and
kissed
the
serious
little
face
is
your
mother
dead
my
deary
she
asked
while
the
tears
shone
in
her
own
eyes
see
done
to
see
daddy
and
tell
him
about
tiny
answered
the
child
from
which
coomber
gathered
that
mother
and
father
were
both
dead
and
when
her
husband
came
home
she
told
him
what
she
had
heard
which
seemed
to
afford
the
old
fisherman
a
good
deal
of
satisfaction
then
she
ours
safe
enough
mother
he
said
rubbing
his
hands
and
when
she
gets
well
she
toddle
about
the
old
boat
like
our
own
little
polly
did
but
i
thought
you
said
peters
was
going
to
see
the
newspaper
man
to
tell
him
to
put
something
in
the
about
finding
her
so
that
her
friends
should
know
she
was
saved
and
come
and
fetch
her
i
said
her
mother
or
father
interrupted
coomber
sharply
but
if
they
dead
there
ai
anybody
else
likely
to
want
such
a
little
and
so
we
may
keep
her
i
take
it
but
peters
shall
go
to
the
newspaper
man
never
fear
added
coomber
i
do
want
to
rob
anybody
of
the
little
but
if
nobody
do
come
in
a
week
why
then
mary
and
coomber
paused
and
looked
at
his
wife
well
then
i
get
out
little
polly
things
they
just
about
fit
her
said
coomber
hastily
wiping
her
eyes
with
her
apron
for
fear
her
husband
should
reproach
her
again
for
her
tears
when
the
boys
came
in
the
little
girl
said
shyly
tome
and
tell
me
about
the
nets
dick
looked
at
her
and
then
at
his
mother
what
does
she
mean
he
asked
drawing
near
the
little
bed
where
tiny
lay
she
wants
to
know
about
the
fishing
said
coomber
have
you
had
a
good
take
dick
asked
his
mother
rather
anxiously
for
she
wanted
some
more
milk
for
tiny
and
her
little
secret
store
of
halfpence
was
gone
now
oh
it
ai
much
said
dick
bob
has
taken
a
few
plaice
to
fellness
and
i
dessay
he

back
some
bread
or
some
flour
but
i
want
some
milk
for
the
child
she
ca
eat
bread
and
fish
and
potatoes
now
she
could
you
run
up
to
the
farm
dick
and
ask
hayes
if
she
wants
a
bit
o
fish
and
i
be
thankful
for
a
drop
o
milk
for
it
but
dick
looked
dubious
i
like
to
go
he
said
if
it
was
only
to
have
a
word
with
harry
hayes
and
ask
him
about
his
rabbits
but
father
do
like
the
farm
people
now
and
he
said
i
was
never
to
speak
to
them
you
know
they
had
a
quarrel
well
what
are
we
to
do
they
are
our
only
neighbours
and
they
ai
a
bad
sort
either
hayes
is
a
kind
soul
who
has
children
of
her
own
and
would
let
me
have
milk
in
a
minute
if
she
knew
i
wanted
it
for
this
poor
little
mite
said
coomber
in
perplexity
as
to
the
best
thing
to
do
i
go
mother
if
you
can
find
any
fish
worth
taking
at
last
said
dick
coomber
went
and
turned
over
what
the
boys
had
brought
the
best
had
been
picked
out
and
sent
to
fellness
and
what
was
left
was
not
more
than
sufficient
for
themselves
but
she
carefully
looked
out
the
largest
she
could
find
and
washed
it
while
she
was
doing
this
her
husband
came
in
it
a
poor
take
mother
he
said
yes
and
i
wanted
a
bit
extra
to
get
some
milk
for
the
child
said
coomber
but
i
think
i
can
manage
with
this
she
said
still
busying
herself
with
the
fish
and
not
turning
to
look
at
her
husband
what
are
yer
goin
to
do
wi
it
he
inquired
i
want
to
send
dick
up
to
the
farm
hayes
will
give
me
some
milk
for
it
i
know
replied
his
wife
trying
to
speak
in
a
tone
illustration
likes
she
said
page
and
you
send
dick
to
that
place
when
i
said
they
should
go
near
the
house
said
her
husband
angrily
take
the
fish
and
cook
it
for
supper
not
a
bit
o
my
fish
shall
they
have
but
the
milk
what
am
i
to
do
for
the
milk
for
the
child
now
ill
what
have
yer
done
afore
demanded
her
husband
and
the
poor
woman
was
obliged
to
confess
that
she
had
taken
milk
from
the
man
as
he
went
past
in
his
cart
to
the
village
each
day
since
the
child
had
been
there
she
could
do
milk
protested
coomber
how
do
you
know
she
could
said
her
husband
what
business
have
you
to
spend
money
for
milk
what
business
have
you
wi
money
at
all
he
inquired
suspiciously
for
he
saw
in
this
wastefulness
a
cause
for
the
recent
strange
scarcity
of
whisky
and
he
felt
he
had
been
deeply
wronged
his
quarrel
with
hayes
had
also
been
disregarded
and
this
made
him
further
angry
with
his
wife
and
he
strictly
charged
her
never
to
have
any
more
dealings
with
any
of
the
farm
people
we
can
live
very
well
without
milk
he
said
i
will
feed
the
little
and
you
see
she
can
eat
fish
and
bread
as
well
as
the
rest
of
us
it
was
useless
for
coomber
to
protest
against
this
she
knew
if
her
husband
made
up
his
mind
to
do
anything
he
would
do
it
but
she
almost
dreaded
coming
for
she
could
not
tell
how
tiny
would
like
the
proposed
change
in
her
nurse
and
diet
but
as
it
happened
the
little
girl
was
very
pleased
to
be
lifted
out
of
bed
and
seated
on
coomber
knee
at
the
table
me
likes
she
said
patting
his
cheek
with
her
little
white
hand
and
she
ate
the
fish
and
bread
as
though
she
was
quite
used
to
such
food

iii
tiny
hope
the
slant
rays
of
the
setting
sun
lay
on
the
wide
stretch
of
level
sand
surrounding
bermuda
point
for
the
tide
was
out
and
had
left
it
smooth
or
slightly
rippled
as
with
tiny
wavelets
standing
at
the
very
edge
of
the
sands
with
her
eyes
shaded
and
her
clothes
blowing
round
her
bare
legs
was
a
little
girl
she
was
slender
and
still
in
spite
of
the
arms
and
face
months
had
passed
but
tiny
was
still
at
the
point
she
stood
gazing
seawards
for
some
minutes
and
then
turned
and
walked
slowly
across
the
rippled
sand
i
ca
see
him
dick
she
said
in
a
disappointed
tone
oh
well
never
mind
said
the
boy
who
sat
scooping
the
loose
sand
up
in
a
heap
beyond
the
reach
of
the
present
ordinary
tides
have
you
filled
both
the
baskets
asked
the
little
girl
as
she
waded
through
the
loose
dry
sand
to
where
the
boy
was
sitting
no
that
i
ai
answered
dick
mother
said
you
could
pick
the
samphire
yes
but
you
said
you
help
me
said
the
girl
walking
steadily
across
the
sand
to
the
beyond
here
the
samphire
grew
in
abundance
and
the
little
girl
set
to
work
to
fill
the
two
large
baskets
that
stood
near
you
might
come
and
help
dick
she
called
hardly
repressing
a
sob
as
she
spoke
look
here
i
help
if
you
just
come
and
make
some
more
of
them
letters
you
said
you
would
you
know
added
the
boy
still
piling
up
the
sand
oh
dick
you
know
i
ca
you
know
i
forgot
everything
since
i
been
here
and
this
time
the
little
girl
fairly
burst
into
tears
and
sat
down
beside
the
baskets
and
sobbed
as
though
her
heart
would
break
the
boy
heart
was
touched
at
the
sight
of
her
distress
and
he
ran
across
to
comfort
her
do
cry
tiny
i
help
yer
and
then
we
try
agin
at
the
letters
i
know
three
a
b
c
you
soon
find
out
about
the
others
and
make
in
the
sand
for
me
but
tiny
shook
her
head
i
know
if
i
had
a
book
she
said
sadly
ai
it
a
pity
daddy
ai
got
one
what
be
the
good
of
books
to
dad
said
dick
harry
hayes
has
got
some
i
know
but
then
he
goes
to
school
and
knows
all
about
there
let
forget
we
see
him
with
that
book
yesterday
for
it
ai
no
good
for
us
to
think
about
it
concluded
dick
for
he
did
not
like
to
see
tiny
tears
and
the
easiest
way
of
banishing
them
was
to
forget
the
original
cause
he
thought
but
the
little
girl
was
not
of
the
same
opinion
she
shook
her
head
sadly
as
she
said
i
forgot
everything
my
mother
told
me
oh
that
you
ai
contradicted
the
boy
you
never
forget
to
say
your
prayers
before
you
go
to
bed
i
wonder
you
ai
forgot
that
i
should
i
know
how
could
you
dick
if
you
knew
god
was
waiting
to
hear
you
said
tiny
lifting
her
serious
blue
eyes
to
his
face
then
why
ai
he
waiting
to
hear
me
asked
dick
the
question
seemed
to
puzzle
the
little
girl
for
a
minute
or
two
but
at
length
she
said
he
is
dick
i
think
i
sure
he
waiting
for
yer
to
begin
then
he
waited
a
good
while
said
dick
bluntly
and
he
got
up
and
began
to
pull
away
at
the
samphire
by
way
of
working
off
or
digesting
the
wonderful
thought
after
working
away
in
silence
for
some
minutes
dick
said
d
think
god
cares
for
us
down
here
at
bermuda
point
tiny
paused
with
her
hands
full
of
samphire
why
should
he
she
said
i
know
he
cares
for
me
he
loves
me
she
added
in
a
tone
of
triumph
my
mother
told
me
so
she
said
he
loved
me
just
as
well
as
she
did
i
like
to
know
whether
he
cares
about
me
said
dick
d
think
yer
could
find
out
for
us
tiny
yer
see
everybody
likes
you
mother
and
father
and
bob
and
harry
hayes
showed
you
his
book
yesterday
you
see
you
a
gal
and
i
think
you
pretty
added
dick
critically
so
it
be
a
wonder
if
he
did
like
you
and
why
should
he
love
you
dick
said
tiny
dick
looked
down
at
the
patched
ragged
nondescript
garments
that
served
him
as
jacket
and
trousers
and
then
at
his
bare
sunburnt
arms
and
legs
well
i
just
dick
of
the
point
i
ai
a
gal
and
i
pretty
nobody
could
dispute
the
latter
fact
which
dick
himself
seemed
to
consider
conclusive
against
any
interest
being
taken
in
him
for
he
heaved
a
sigh
as
he
returned
to
his
work
of
picking
the
samphire
the
sigh
was
not
lost
on
tiny
look
here
dick
she
said
you
ai
a
gal
and
you
ai
pretty
but
i
love
you
and
she
threw
her
arms
round
his
neck
as
he
stooped
over
the
basket
i
love
yer
dick
and
i
find
out
all
about
it
for
yer
i
sure
god
loves
yer
too
oh
he
ca
yet
yer
know
said
dick
drawing
his
arms
across
his
eyes
to
conceal
the
tears
that
had
suddenly
come
into
them
i
never
say
no
prayers
nor
nothing
i
ai
never
heerd
about
him
only
when
dad
swears
till
you
come
and
said
your
prayers
to
him
still
he
might
yer
know
said
tiny
but
if
you
help
i
find
out
all
about
it
what
can
yer
do
asked
dick
well
i
tell
yer
why
i
want
dad
to
come
home
soon
said
tiny
resting
her
hands
on
the
basket
and
looking
anxiously
across
the
sea
mother
said
he
take
the
samphire
by
boat
to
fellness
and
i
thought
perhaps
he
take
me
too
well
he
did
said
dick
who
could
see
no
connection
between
a
visit
to
the
village
and
the
attainment
of
the
knowledge
they
both
desired
why
then
i
might
get
a
book
said
tiny
i
go
with
dad
to
sell
the
samphire
and
then
we
see
the
shops
and
if
he
had
a
good
take
and
we
got
a
lot
of
samphire
he
have
enough
money
to
buy
me
a
book
as
well
as
the
bread
and
flour
and
tea
dick
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
so
this
is
your
secret
this
is
what
you
been
thinking
of
like
a
little
goose
all
day
tiny
was
half
offended
you
need
laugh
she
said
i
shall
do
it
dick
will
yer
he
said
in
a
teasing
tone
if
there
was
no
whisky
and
there
was
bookshops
at
fellness
you
might
why
what
do
you
think
the
village
is
like
he
asked
like
oh
i
dunno
everything
comes
from
fellness
added
the
little
girl
vaguely
to
the
dwellers
at
the
point
the
little
was
the
centre
of
the
universe
and
tiny
with
faint
recollections
of
a
large
town
with
broad
streets
and
rows
of
shops
all
brilliantly
lighted
at
night
had
formed
magnificently
vague
notions
of
fellness
as
being
something
like
this
and
she
had
only
got
to
go
there
and
it
would
be
easy
to
coax
the
old
fisherman
to
buy
her
a
book
as
she
coaxed
him
to
build
her
a
castle
in
the
sand
or
take
her
on
his
knee
and
tell
her
tales
of
ships
that
had
been
wrecked
on
the
bar
sands
but
do
you
know
what
fellness
is
like
persisted
dick
there
ai
no
shops
at
all
only
one
where
they
sells
flour
and
bread
and
and
tea
and
sugar
and
soap
they
has
meat
there
sometimes
but
i
never
sees
no
books
and
i
do
believe
they
ever
has
there
concluded
the
boy
perhaps
they
keeps
in
a
box
where
you
ca
see
suggested
tiny
who
was
very
unwilling
to
relinquish
her
hope
pigs
might
fly
and
they
will
when
they
sells
books
at
fellness
remarked
dick
where
does
harry
hayes
get
his
from
suddenly
asked
the
girl
and
at
the
same
moment
she
espied
a
speck
on
the
horizon
which
she
decided
was
a
fisherman
boat
he
coming
dick
dad
coming
she
exclaimed
make
haste
make
haste
and
fill
up
the
baskets
and
she
tore
away
at
the
seaweed
piling
it
into
the
baskets
as
fast
as
her
small
hands
would
permit
now
we
carry
one
down
she
said
taking
hold
of
the
handle
catch
hold
dick
for
she
wanted
to
be
at
the
edge
of
the
sands
by
the
time
the
boat
touched
the
shore
but
dick
was
in
no
such
hurry
to
meet
his
father
there
plenty
of
time
he
said
leisurely
untying
a
knot
in
a
piece
of
string
no
there
is
dick
do
you
know
i
going
to
fellness
in
the
boat
but
you
afraid
said
the
boy
ai
father
tried
to
coax
you
lots
o
times
to
go
out
with
him
and
yer
never
would
you
just
get
to
the
edge
and
when
yer
sees
it
rock
a
bit
yer
run
away
no
i
wo
dick
this
time
said
the
little
girl
but
as
she
spoke
a
shiver
of
fear
and
dread
ran
through
her
frame
at
the
thought
of
the
swaying
boat
dick
saw
it
and
laughed
did
i
tell
yer
you
was
afraid
he
said
in
a
mocking
tone
what
the
good
of
going
down
there
when
frightened
but
i
want
a
book
dick
i
must
learn
to
read
and
find
out
what
we
want
to
know
oh
do
make
haste
she
added
as
she
saw
the
boat
approaching
the
shore
dick
was
still
laughing
but
he
helped
her
carry
the
basket
though
he
teased
her
as
they
went
along
about
being
frightened
they
got
across
the
sands
with
their
samphire
just
as
coomber
and
bob
were
springing
ashore
oh
daddy
take
me
with
yer
to
fellness
called
tiny
shutting
her
eyes
as
she
spoke
that
she
might
not
see
the
treacherous
waves
and
the
swaying
boat
halloo
halloo
what
now
deary
exclaimed
coomber
and
it
was
wonderful
to
see
the
change
in
his
hard
face
as
he
lifted
the
little
girl
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
she
says
she
go
said
dick
but
i
do
believe
she
means
it
yes
i
do
you
take
me
daddy
wo
yer
i
picked
a
lot
of
samphire
all
that
and
another
basketful
up
there
go
and
fetch
it
bob
and
daddy
can
put
it
in
the
boat
and
i
going
too
so
you
shall
deary
so
you
shall
said
the
old
fisherman
in
a
pleased
tone
for
he
had
often
tried
to
coax
her
out
with
him
on
the
sea
but
the
memory
of
that
awful
night
on
the
bar
sands
still
clung
to
her
and
the
sight
of
the
boat
swayed
about
at
the
mercy
of
the
waves
filled
her
with
a
nameless
terror
there
wo
be
a
storm
will
there
asked
tiny
with
a
shiver
of
fear
as
the
fisherman
carefully
lifted
her
in
and
placed
her
beside
the
basket
of
samphire
my
deary
if
i
thought
the
wind
be
even
a
bit
fresh
i
would
take
yer
said
the
fisherman
in
an
earnest
tone
he
had
never
been
so
tender
with
one
of
his
own
children
unless
it
was
to
the
little
girl
lying
in
the
churchyard
as
he
was
to
this
little
waif
of
the
sea
and
now
as
he
pushed
off
from
the
shore
he
was
careful
to
keep
the
old
boat
as
steady
as
possible
and
sat
watching
her
little
frightened
face
as
he
plied
his
oars
he
kept
as
close
to
the
beach
too
as
he
well
could
just
skirting
the
so
that
she
should
have
the
comfort
of
seeing
the
land
all
the
way
along
after
a
few
minutes
tiny
grew
less
frightened
and
ventured
to
ask
a
question
about
where
they
were
going
oh
i
take
yer
to
see
dame
peters
while
bob
unloads
the
boat
said
coomber
nodding
at
her
in
an
approving
manner
and
shall
i
see
the
shops
asked
tiny
for
she
did
not
believe
what
dick
had
told
her
shops
shops
repeated
the
fisherman
resting
on
his
oars
for
a
minute
to
stare
at
the
little
girl
well
there
a
shop
he
said
slowly
but
i
do
see
what
you
can
want
there
do
they
sell
books
asked
tiny
eagerly
for
answer
the
fisherman
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
what
does
a
little
like
you
know
about
books
he
said
but
i
know
of
something
they
do
sell
as
suit
you
a
deal
better
they
sell
sweets
and
almond
rock
as
well
as
and
bread
and
you
shall
have
some
my
deary
the
fisherman
expected
a
joyous
outburst
in
anticipation
of
these
unwonted
dainties
but
the
little
girl
said
slowly
do
they
sell
books
too
daddy
i
rather
have
a
book
than
almond
rock
she
added
why
what
do
you
want
with
a
book
a
little
like
you
said
coomber
impatiently
we
both
wants
it
dick
and
me
we
wants
to
find
out
whether
god
loves
boys
as
well
as
gals
the
fisherman
looked
at
her
serious
little
face
for
a
minute
and
then
burst
into
a
laugh
again
well
you
are
a
rum
as
ever
i
came
across
did
you
hear
that
bob
he
asked
appealing
to
his
elder
son
who
was
steering
bob
turned
his
sulky
face
round
what
she
saying
now
he
asked
what
was
it
little
whether
god
loved
boys
and
gals
was
it
asked
the
fisherman
who
was
highly
amused
at
the
question
he
do
love
none
of
us
i
can
tell
her
that
said
bob
sharply
he
forgot
us
long
ago
if
ever
he
knowed
anything
about
us
there
what
d
think
o
that
little
said
the
fisherman
pulling
away
at
the
oars
tiny
looked
perplexed
for
a
minute
or
two
but
at
length
she
said
i
think
god
knows
all
about
the
point
he
loves
me
and
he
listens
when
i
say
my
prayers
but
i
tell
him
she
suddenly
added
as
though
the
thought
had
just
occurred
to
her
i
can
ask
him
to
bless
you
and
mammy
and
dick
and
bob
but
i
should
like
to
get
a
book
she
said
in
conclusion
oh
the
sweets
do
as
well
said
the
fisherman
who
saw
little
use
in
books
he
might
have
humoured
tiny
in
what
he
looked
upon
as
a
most
extraordinary
whim
but
he
never
remembered
seeing
such
a
thing
as
a
book
in
fellness
all
the
years
he
had
known
the
place
people
might
have
books
some
of
them
at
least
but
they
were
not
of
much
use
to
and
he
rather
despised
them
the
sun
had
gone
down
before
they
landed
but
the
moon
was
rising
and
so
between
daylight
and
moonlight
they
would
be
able
to
get
back
without
any
difficulty
when
the
fish
and
samphire
were
disposed
of
now
bob
get
her
unloaded
while
i
take
the
little
up
to
see
dame
peters
said
coomber
as
he
lifted
tiny
out
of
the
boat
she
was
looking
round
eagerly
in
search
of
the
houses
and
shops
for
in
spite
of
what
she
had
been
told
she
could
not
divest
herself
of
the
idea
that
fellness
was
a
grand
glorious
place
where
everything
could
be
bought
if
people
only
had
fish
and
seaweed
enough
and
surely
two
big
baskets
of
samphire
were
sufficient
to
buy
a
book
but
to
her
disappointment
she
saw
only
a
few
lounging
fishermen
and
children
like
herself
and
dick
instead
of
the
crowds
of
people
she
had
expected
and
as
for
shops
well
she
could
see
a
row
of
stone
cottages
at
a
distance
there
might
be
a
dozen
perhaps
and
a
few
sheds
and
outbuildings
but
the
rest
of
the
landscape
was
flat
and
unoccupied
as
their
own
point
and
at
the
sight
tiny
hid
her
face
in
the
neck
and
burst
into
tears
illustration
chapter
iv
tiny
treasure
well
now
if
you
can
make
her
out
it
more
than
i
can
said
coomber
pausing
in
the
doorway
of
dame
peters
cottage
after
he
had
seated
tiny
by
the
old
woman
fire
oh
leave
her
here
for
half
an
hour
she
be
all
right
by
the
time
you
come
back
there
no
for
children
and
she
may
feel
frightened
a
bit
for
all
she
ai
cried
till
she
got
ashore
it
just
that
that
beats
me
said
the
fisherman
she
as
lively
as
you
please
in
the
boat
but
as
soon
as
she
gets
out
down
she
pops
her
head
and
begins
to
pipe
her
eye
well
there
you
go
and
look
after
perkins
and
the
fish
and
i
see
to
her
said
dame
peters
a
little
impatiently
for
she
had
some
potatoes
cooking
for
her
husband
supper
and
she
knew
they
needed
attention
after
looking
to
these
she
turned
to
tiny
who
had
dried
her
tears
by
this
time
and
sat
watching
the
old
woman
d
like
to
see
pictures
deary
she
asked
and
at
the
same
time
she
opened
the
top
drawer
of
an
chest
of
drawers
and
brought
out
a
print
which
she
laid
on
the
table
and
lifted
tiny
chair
and
all
close
up
to
look
at
it
pictures
were
not
to
be
seen
in
every
cottage
a
few
years
ago
as
they
may
be
now
the
of
hope
and
had
not
been
heard
of
in
fellness
at
the
time
of
which
we
write
and
so
dame
peters
was
very
choice
of
her
picture
although
she
knew
nothing
about
the
reading
at
the
back
of
it
tiny
brightened
up
wonderfully
when
her
eyes
fell
upon
this
treasure
but
after
looking
at
it
for
some
minutes
while
dame
peters
turned
out
the
potatoes
she
ventured
to
lift
it
up
and
look
at
the
other
side
and
she
exclaimed
joyfully
oh
it
a
book
there
reading
on
it
what
what
exclaimed
the
old
woman
turning
from
the
fireplace
to
see
what
had
happened
what
is
it
child
see
see
there
reading
g
o
d
what
does
that
spell
asked
tiny
looking
up
in
the
old
woman
face
her
finger
still
resting
on
the
word
she
had
picked
out
bless
the
child
how
should
i
know
it
is
some
sort
of
reading
as
you
say
but
i
never
learned
a
letter
in
my
life
and
i
forgot
said
tiny
sadly
and
then
her
finger
roved
over
the
printed
page
and
she
found
that
she
could
remember
most
of
the
letters
now
she
saw
them
again
but
how
to
put
them
together
was
the
difficulty
she
had
forgotten
how
to
do
this
entirely
g
o
d
spelt
a
word
familiar
enough
to
her
at
one
time
but
which
of
all
the
words
she
used
now
those
letters
were
intended
to
signify
she
could
not
remember
again
and
again
her
finger
returned
to
the
letters
but
beyond
this
her
memory
failed
her
and
she
sat
with
puckered
brow
and
steadfast
eyes
still
looking
at
the
printed
page
instead
of
the
picture
when
coomber
came
back
oh
daddy
daddy
look
here
exclaimed
tiny
here
a
book
with
reading
she
just
sat
and
looked
at
them
letters
as
she
calls
ever
since
you
been
gone
said
dame
peters
in
a
tone
for
her
picture
was
not
valued
as
much
as
it
ought
to
be
she
thought
oh
she
a
rum
said
coomber
well
now
are
you
ready
little
he
asked
tiny
looked
up
wistfully
in
the
old
woman
face
could
i
take
this
home
and
show
it
to
dick
she
asked
timidly
laying
her
hand
on
the
print
take
my
picture
home
exclaimed
the
old
woman
coomber
turned
the
paper
over
and
looked
at
it
contemptuously
peters
got
this
when
he
went
to
grimsby
i
he
said
yes
he
did
well
now
could
you
let
her
have
it
and
let
peters
bring
you
another
said
the
fisherman
who
was
anxious
that
his
darling
should
be
gratified
if
possible
but
the
old
woman
was
little
more
than
a
child
herself
over
this
picture
and
was
unwilling
to
part
with
it
at
first
at
last
she
agreed
to
sell
it
to
tiny
for
a
basket
of
samphire
for
this
seaweed
made
a
kind
of
pickle
among
the
and
was
of
some
marketable
value
too
for
it
did
not
grow
everywhere
along
the
coast
although
round
bermuda
point
it
flourished
in
great
luxuriance
tiny
was
only
too
glad
to
obtain
such
a
treasure
on
such
easy
terms
although
she
was
paying
about
five
times
the
value
of
it
and
when
it
had
been
folded
up
and
carefully
stowed
away
in
coomber
pocket
she
was
quite
ready
to
go
to
the
boat
although
dame
peters
pressed
them
to
stay
and
have
some
of
the
hot
potatoes
for
supper
tiny
seemed
brimful
of
joy
that
night
and
when
she
was
seated
in
the
boat
and
they
were
rowing
over
the
placid
water
she
so
far
forgot
her
fears
as
to
begin
singing
something
in
the
surroundings
had
recalled
to
her
mind
the
time
when
she
used
to
sing
nearly
every
night
her
favourite
hymn
it
all
came
back
to
her
as
freshly
as
though
she
had
sung
it
only
last
week
and
her
sweet
young
voice
rang
out
bold
and
clear
star
of
peace
to
wanderers
weary
bright
the
beams
that
smile
on
me
cheer
the
pilot
vision
dreary
far
far
at
sea
she
paused
there
not
feeling
quite
sure
of
the
next
verse
but
coomber
said
quickly
go
on
deary
go
on
do
you
know
the
next
bit
i
try
said
tiny
and
again
the
voice
rang
out
in
its
childish
treble
star
of
hope
gleam
on
the
billow
bless
the
soul
that
sighs
for
thee
bless
the
sailor
lonely
pillow
far
far
at
sea
who
told
you
that
deary
asked
the
fisherman
eagerly
when
she
paused
again
my
mother
used
to
sing
it
every
night
she
used
to
say
it
was
meant
for
daddy
and
she
told
me
i
must
always
sing
it
too
only
somehow
forgot
everything
since
i
came
here
never
mind
the
rest
deary
try
and
think
about
that
it
just
the
song
for
a
sailor
and
a
sailor
lass
that
just
what
my
mother
used
to
say
that
i
was
a
sailor
lass
exclaimed
tiny
and
she
taught
you
just
the
right
kind
of
a
song
now
try
a
bit
more
deary
he
added
coaxingly
star
of
faith
when
winds
are
mocking
all
his
toil
he
flies
to
thee
save
him
on
the
billows
rocking
far
far
at
sea
i
do
think
i
know
any
more
said
the
child
as
she
finished
this
verse
well
you
done
deary
and
mind
you
must
sing
that
song
to
me
every
night
he
added
for
a
little
while
they
went
on
in
silence
and
nothing
could
be
heard
but
the
gentle
lap
lap
of
the
waves
at
the
side
of
the
boat
until
coomber
said
come
sing
to
us
again
about
that
sailor
star
bob
you
try
and
pick
it
up
as
she
sings
he
added
so
the
verses
were
sung
through
again
and
without
a
break
this
time
and
tiny
was
able
to
recall
the
last
verse
too
and
sang
star
divine
oh
safely
guide
him
bring
the
wanderer
back
to
thee
sore
temptations
long
have
tried
him
far
far
at
sea
bravo
little
exclaimed
bob
who
was
completely
charmed
out
of
his
sulky
mood
by
the
singing
i
say
bob
suddenly
exclaimed
coomber
is
the
bottle
up
there
i
ai
seen
the
bottle
sulkily
responded
the
lad
his
returning
at
once
i
i
took
it
up
and
told
to
fill
it
exclaimed
coomber
and
as
he
spoke
he
drew
in
his
oars
and
felt
under
the
seat
and
all
round
the
boat
i
must
ha
forgot
it
thinking
about
the
little
and
her
picture
he
said
after
searching
round
the
boat
in
vain
it
too
late
to
go
back
said
bob
it
be
dark
soon
it
too
late
to
go
back
with
the
child
said
coomber
slowly
and
regretfully
though
what
he
should
do
without
his
nightly
dose
of
whisky
he
did
not
know
sing
again
whispered
bob
to
tiny
and
the
next
minute
the
little
voice
rang
out
once
more
its
star
of
peace
it
brought
peace
to
the
angry
fisherman
the
more
angry
perhaps
because
he
had
nobody
but
himself
to
blame
that
the
bottle
had
been
left
behind
before
they
landed
the
singing
had
worked
its
mysterious
charm
and
the
fisherman
had
almost
forgotten
his
anger
and
his
bottle
too
you
tie
up
the
boat
and
make
haste
in
bob
he
said
as
he
took
the
little
girl
in
his
arms
and
stepped
out
upon
the
shore
a
light
was
shining
in
the
window
of
the
old
and
tiny
was
all
impatience
to
get
home
and
show
her
treasure
to
dick
take
it
out
of
your
pocket
daddy
and
give
it
to
me
she
said
as
they
were
crossing
the
sands
and
the
moment
the
door
was
opened
she
ran
in
exclaiming
i
got
it
i
got
it
dick
hush
hush
deary
dick
and
tom
have
gone
to
bed
and
both
are
fast
asleep
come
in
and
get
your
supper
it
been
waiting
ever
so
long
for
you
as
she
spoke
the
poor
woman
cast
several
furtive
glances
at
her
husband
fearing
that
he
was
more
than
usually
morose
as
he
had
not
spoken
but
to
her
surprise
he
said
in
a
merry
tone
bless
you
mother
the
little
has
got
something
better
than
supper
dame
peters
wanted
her
to
stay
and
have
some
hot
potatoes
but
she
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
be
off
with
her
prize
that
she
would
look
at
the
potatoes
i
got
some
reading
said
tiny
in
a
delighted
whisper
holding
up
her
sheet
of
paper
why
what
the
good
of
that
exclaimed
coomber
in
a
disappointed
tone
nobody
at
the
point
can
read
unless
it
the
at
the
farm
and
she
better
not
let
me
catch
her
with
any
of
them
put
in
coomber
sharply
dick
and
me
are
going
to
learn
to
read
by
ourselves
announced
tiny
spreading
out
her
picture
on
the
table
this
would
enhance
its
value
to
everybody
she
thought
since
dame
peters
set
such
store
by
it
solely
because
of
the
picture
and
so
she
did
not
venture
to
turn
it
over
to
con
the
letters
on
the
other
side
until
after
bob
had
come
in
and
they
had
all
looked
at
it
what
it
all
about
asked
bob
turning
to
the
smoking
plate
of
fish
which
his
mother
had
just
placed
on
the
table
do
you
see
it
a
kind
man
putting
his
hand
on
the
boys
heads
said
tiny
rather
scornfully
oh
anybody
can
see
that
said
bob
but
what
does
it
mean
what
i
want
to
know
but
tiny
could
only
shake
her
head
as
she
gazed
earnestly
at
the
print
i
dunno
what
it
is
she
said
with
a
sigh
come
come
you
must
put
that
away
for
said
coomber
you
ought
to
have
been
in
bed
an
hour
ago
and
she
would
have
taken
the
picture
away
but
tiny
hastily
snatched
it
up
and
carefully
folding
it
wrapped
it
in
another
piece
of
paper
and
then
begged
that
it
might
be
put
away
in
a
drawer
for
fear
it
should
be
lost
before
the
morning
coomber
smiled
as
she
took
it
from
her
hand
i
take
care
of
it
she
said
and
you
go
and
get
your
supper
it
was
not
often
that
the
fisherman
family
were
up
so
late
as
this
but
no
one
seemed
in
a
hurry
to
go
to
bed
coomber
himself
was
so
that
his
wife
and
bob
forgot
their
habitual
fear
of
him
in
listening
to
his
account
of
how
brave
tiny
had
been
and
how
dame
peters
thought
she
was
growing
very
fast
then
tiny
had
to
sing
one
verse
of
star
of
peace
after
she
had
finished
her
supper
coomber
would
not
let
her
sing
more
than
that
for
she
was
looking
very
sleepy
and
tired
and
then
they
all
went
to
bed
with
a
strange
new
feeling
of
peace
and
content
coomber
vaguely
wondering
what
had
become
of
the
whisky
bottle
and
wishing
every
night
could
be
like
this
as
soon
as
her
eyes
were
open
the
next
morning
tiny
thought
of
her
treasure
and
crept
into
the
boys
room
to
tell
dick
the
wonderful
news
but
to
her
surprise
she
found
the
bed
was
empty
and
peeping
into
the
kitchen
saw
coomber
washing
up
the
breakfast
things
oh
mammy
what
is
the
time
she
exclaimed
but
yawning
as
she
spoke
oh
you
awake
at
last
make
haste
and
put
your
clothes
on
and
come
and
have
your
breakfast
said
coomber
where
dick
asked
tiny
he
helping
daddy
and
bob
with
the
net
and
you
can
go
too
when
you
had
your
breakfast
daddy
would
let
the
boys
come
and
wake
you
you
was
so
tired
last
night
what
are
they
doing
to
the
net
asked
tiny
as
she
came
to
the
table
mending
it
of
course
daddy
going
shrimping
what
a
bother
that
net
is
said
tiny
daddy
always
mending
it
yes
so
he
is
deary
it
old
you
see
and
we
ca
afford
to
get
a
new
one
i
got
to
get
a
lot
of
samphire
and
i
promised
dick
i
make
some
more
letters
for
him
in
the
sand
said
tiny
meditatively
but
daddy
wants
you
to
help
him
with
the
net
suggested
coomber
the
little
girl
had
always
been
so
pliant
so
amenable
to
control
that
coomber
was
surprised
to
hear
her
say
passionately
i
wo
do
that
nasty
net
i
must
pick
the
samphire
for
dame
peters
and
show
dick
my
picture
first
and
then
she
snatched
up
a
basket
and
ran
out
not
to
the
sands
where
the
fisherman
and
his
boys
sat
mending
the
torn
net
but
away
to
the
where
the
seaweed
grew
thickest
and
she
could
fill
her
basket
most
quickly
in
an
hour
or
two
she
came
home
looking
tired
and
cross
ai
dick
come
home
yet
she
asked
throwing
herself
on
the
floor
they
ai
done
the
net
yet
tom
came
to
fetch
you
a
little
while
ago
i
do
want
tom
i
want
dick
we
going
to
make
some
letters
and
learn
to
read
said
tiny
you
better
leave
the
reading
alone
if
it
makes
you
so
cross
said
coomber
no
it
do
make
me
cross
it
that
nasty
net
but
you
always
liked
to
help
daddy
wind
the
string
and
mend
the
net
before
why
do
you
go
to
them
now
but
tiny
would
not
move
she
lay
on
the
floor
kicking
and
grumbling
because
dick
could
not
leave
the
net
and
come
and
see
her
picture
you
a
very
naughty
girl
tiny
said
coomber
at
last
and
i
do
see
how
you
can
think
god
will
love
you
if
you
do
try
to
be
good
the
little
girl
sat
up
instantly
and
looked
earnestly
into
her
face
my
other
mammy
used
to
say
something
like
that
she
said
slowly
and
then
she
burst
into
tears
and
ran
and
shut
herself
in
the
bedroom
what
passed
there
coomber
did
not
know
but
half
an
hour
afterwards
as
she
glanced
out
of
the
little
kitchen
window
she
saw
her
running
across
the
sands
to
where
the
group
of
boys
sat
mending
the
old
net
and
she
smiled
as
she
thought
of
what
her
words
had
done
she
did
not
know
what
a
hard
fight
tiny
had
had
with
herself
before
she
could
make
up
her
mind
to
give
up
her
own
way
she
only
thought
how
pleased
her
husband
would
be
when
he
saw
the
child
come
running
towards
him
and
that
a
fit
of
from
which
they
would
probably
all
have
suffered
had
been
warded
off
by
the
little
girl
conquest
of
herself
but
neither
tiny
nor
coomber
ever
forgot
that
day
a
new
element
was
introduced
into
the
lives
of
the
fisherman
family
the
little
girl
learned
her
first
lesson
in
and
dick
and
tom
began
to
master
the
difficulties
of
the
alphabet
for
when
the
net
was
finished
and
bob
and
his
father
waded
out
into
the
sea
on
their
shrimping
expedition
tiny
ran
and
fetched
her
pretty
picture
to
show
the
boys
and
then
they
all
set
to
work
with
bits
of
stick
to
make
the
letters
in
the
sand
illustration
chapter
on
the
sands
tiny
was
somewhat
disappointed
as
the
days
went
on
to
find
that
her
pupils
tom
and
dick
took
less
and
less
interest
in
learning
the
letters
she
marked
in
the
sand
or
pointed
out
on
the
paper
they
teased
her
to
know
how
to
put
the
letters
together
and
make
them
into
words
which
they
could
understand
but
alas
labour
as
she
would
tiny
could
not
get
over
this
difficulty
even
for
herself
she
had
a
dim
idea
that
g
o
d
spelt
god
but
she
could
not
be
quite
sure
not
sure
enough
to
tell
dick
that
it
was
so
it
was
enough
however
to
quicken
her
own
interest
in
what
the
lines
of
letters
might
be
able
to
tell
her
if
only
she
could
solve
the
mystery
of
putting
them
into
words
for
doubtless
they
would
clear
up
her
anxiety
as
to
whether
god
loved
boys
as
well
as
girls
she
did
not
spend
her
whole
time
poring
over
her
picture
she
gathered
samphire
helped
to
sort
the
fish
when
it
was
brought
in
or
mend
the
net
but
every
day
she
spent
some
time
diligently
tracing
out
the
letters
she
knew
and
spelling
over
g
o
she
might
have
mastered
the
difficulty
with
very
little
trouble
if
the
fisherman
had
been
less
obstinate
in
his
quarrel
with
the
farm
people
for
harry
hayes
and
his
sisters
were
often
down
on
the
sands
sometimes
bringing
their
books
with
them
and
dick
who
longed
to
join
them
in
their
play
tried
to
persuade
tiny
to
go
and
ask
them
to
help
her
with
the
reading
difficulty
dad
wo
say
anything
to
you
even
if
he
should
see
you
talking
but
he
wo
see
and
i
wo
tell
urged
dick
one
day
when
the
children
from
the
farm
were
at
play
among
the
sandhills
and
occasionally
casting
sidelong
glances
towards
dick
and
tiny
but
the
little
girl
only
shook
her
head
i
ca
dick
she
said
god
would
like
it
mother
told
me
that
long
ago
but
how
is
he
to
know
if
you
do
tell
him
said
the
boy
in
an
impatient
tone
do
you
know
that
god
can
see
us
all
the
time
that
he
taking
care
of
us
always
said
tiny
slowly
oh
come
what
you
tell
us
next
said
dick
looking
over
his
shoulder
with
a
gesture
of
fear
he
ai
here
now
you
know
he
added
yes
he
is
said
the
little
girl
confidently
mother
said
god
was
a
spirit
i
dunno
what
that
is
but
it
just
as
real
as
the
wind
we
ca
see
that
you
know
but
it
real
and
we
ca
see
god
but
close
to
us
all
the
time
the
boy
crept
closer
to
her
while
she
was
speaking
what
makes
you
talk
like
that
he
said
in
a
tone
what
a
matter
dick
she
asked
not
understanding
his
fear
you
like
to
think
god
is
close
to
you
and
all
round
you
she
suddenly
added
in
surprise
dick
shook
his
head
nobody
never
thinks
about
god
at
bermuda
point
so
he
do
come
here
he
said
at
last
in
a
tone
of
relief
oh
i
say
tiny
look
harry
hayes
has
got
a
book
let
go
and
see
what
it
about
well
we
ask
dad
when
he
come
home
and
he
let
us
said
the
little
girl
turning
resolutely
to
her
own
paper
again
oh
then
it
dad
you
afraid
of
and
not
god
said
dick
afraid
what
do
you
mean
asked
tiny
god
loves
me
and
takes
care
of
me
and
so
does
daddy
and
if
i
was
to
talk
to
harry
hayes
it
would
make
him
cross
and
god
does
like
us
to
make
people
cross
and
little
gals
has
to
do
as
they
are
told
you
know
oh
yes
i
know
all
about
that
said
dick
but
what
do
you
suppose
god
thinks
of
dad
when
he
makes
himself
cross
with
the
whisky
oh
he
dreadfully
sorry
dick
i
know
he
is
for
he
makes
me
afraid
of
him
sometimes
when
he
had
a
big
lot
and
he
just
the
dearest
daddy
when
he
forgets
to
bring
the
bottle
home
from
fellness
ah
but
that
ai
often
grunted
dick
and
if
god
would
like
you
to
talk
to
harry
hayes
dad
says
you
mus
i
like
to
know
what
he
thinks
of
dad
sometimes
that
all
and
then
dick
ran
away
for
if
he
could
not
speak
to
the
farm
children
he
liked
to
be
near
them
when
they
came
to
play
on
the
sands
a
minute
or
two
after
dick
had
left
her
tiny
was
startled
by
a
sound
close
at
hand
and
looking
round
she
saw
coomber
coming
from
the
other
side
of
the
sandhill
oh
dad
i
thought
you
was
out
in
the
boat
she
said
illustration
want
you
to
sing
a
bit
while
i
rub
away
at
this
old
gun
page
bob
and
tom
have
gone
by
themselves
for
i
wanted
to
clean
the
gun
ready
for
winter
said
the
fisherman
still
rubbing
at
the
lock
with
a
piece
of
oiled
rag
tiny
looked
up
at
him
half
shyly
half
curiously
for
if
he
had
only
been
on
the
other
side
of
the
he
must
have
heard
all
she
and
dick
had
been
talking
about
but
if
he
had
heard
the
fisherman
took
no
notice
of
what
had
passed
come
i
want
you
to
sing
a
bit
while
i
rub
away
at
this
old
gun
he
said
sing
of
peace
it
sound
out
here
as
though
he
had
never
heard
it
out
there
before
when
as
a
matter
of
fact
scarcely
a
day
passed
but
she
sang
it
to
please
him
when
she
had
finished
he
said
quickly
what
do
you
think
about
that
of
peace
deary
it
the
sailor
star
you
know
so
i
got
a
sort
of
share
in
it
like
i
think
it
means
god
i
sure
mother
said
it
meant
god
added
the
little
girl
ah
then
i
do
think
there
much
share
of
it
for
me
said
coomber
somewhat
sadly
and
he
turned
to
rubbing
his
gun
again
and
began
talking
about
it
how
rusty
he
had
found
it
and
how
he
would
have
to
use
it
more
than
ever
when
winter
came
for
the
boat
was
growing
old
and
would
not
stand
much
more
knocking
about
by
the
rough
wintry
sea
so
he
and
bob
must
shoot
more
wild
birds
and
only
go
out
in
calm
weather
when
winter
came
then
half
shyly
and
with
apparent
effort
he
brought
the
conversation
round
so
as
to
include
farmer
hayes
he
ai
a
bad
sort
you
know
tiny
if
he
could
just
remember
that
a
fisherman
is
a
bit
proud
and
independent
though
he
may
be
poor
and
if
you
could
do
one
of
them
young
a
good
turn
any
time
why
you
a
sailor
lass
yer
know
and
a
sailor
is
always
ready
to
do
a
good
turn
to
anybody
yes
daddy
said
tiny
slowly
and
thoughtfully
and
then
after
a
minute
pause
she
said
daddy
i
think
harry
or
polly
would
just
like
to
help
me
a
bit
with
this
reading
for
answer
the
fisherman
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
that
what
like
i
he
said
as
he
looked
at
her
yes
i
want
to
find
out
about
this
picture
and
these
letters
tell
all
about
it
i
know
if
i
only
could
find
out
what
they
mean
said
tiny
eagerly
oh
well
when
i
gone
indoors
you
can
go
and
ask
if
they
like
to
help
you
he
said
with
another
short
laugh
maybe
you
be
able
to
tell
us
all
about
it
when
winter
comes
and
it
soon
be
here
now
added
the
fisherman
with
a
sigh
never
before
had
coomber
looked
forward
with
such
dread
to
the
winter
until
lately
he
had
always
thought
the
would
last
his
time
as
he
used
to
say
but
he
had
patched
and
repaired
it
so
often
lately
until
at
last
the
conviction
had
been
forced
upon
him
that
it
was
worn
out
and
to
be
caught
in
a
sudden
squall
on
the
open
sea
would
inevitably
break
her
up
and
all
who
were
in
her
would
meet
with
a
watery
grave
he
was
as
brave
as
a
lion
but
to
know
that
his
boat
was
gradually
going
to
pieces
and
that
its
timbers
might
part
company
at
almost
any
moment
made
even
his
courage
quail
especially
when
he
thought
of
his
wife
and
the
boys
and
this
little
helpless
girl
some
hard
things
had
been
said
at
fellness
about
his
folly
in
taking
her
upon
his
hands
when
she
could
without
difficulty
have
been
sent
to
the
poorhouse
a
girl
was
such
a
useless
burden
never
likely
to
be
helpful
in
managing
a
boat
as
a
boy
might
be
and
it
was
clear
that
no
reward
would
ever
be
obtained
from
her
friends
even
if
they
were
found
for
her
clothing
made
it
evident
that
she
was
only
the
child
of
poor
parents
this
had
been
the
reasoning
among
the
fellness
busybodies
ever
since
coomber
had
announced
his
intention
of
taking
the
little
girl
home
but
he
was
as
obstinate
in
this
as
in
most
other
things
he
had
followed
his
own
will
or
rather
the
compassion
of
his
own
heart
in
spite
of
the
poverty
that
surrounded
him
and
the
hard
struggle
he
often
had
to
get
bread
enough
for
his
own
children
i
just
have
to
stay
out
a
bit
longer
or
go
out
in
the
boat
a
bit
oftener
he
said
with
a
light
laugh
when
they
attempted
to
reason
him
out
of
his
project
he
did
not
know
then
that
the
days
of
his
boat
were
numbered
but
he
knew
it
now
knew
that
starvation
stared
them
in
the
face
and
at
no
distant
date
either
he
could
never
hope
to
buy
a
new
boat
it
would
cost
over
twenty
pounds
and
he
seldom
owned
twenty
pence
over
the
day
stock
of
bread
and
other
household
necessaries
among
these
he
counted
his
whisky
for
that
a
fisherman
could
do
his
work
without
a
daily
supply
of
ardent
spirits
never
entered
his
head
blue
ribbon
armies
and
temperance
crusades
had
never
been
heard
of
and
it
was
a
fixed
belief
among
the
fisher
folk
that
a
man
could
not
work
without
drinking
as
well
as
eating
and
drinking
deeply
too
so
coomber
never
thought
of
curtailing
his
daily
allowance
of
grog
to
meet
the
additional
expense
of
his
household
he
rather
increased
the
allowance
that
he
might
be
able
to
work
the
boat
better
as
he
fancied
and
so
catch
more
fish
when
he
forgot
his
bottle
and
left
it
at
fellness
it
struck
him
as
something
all
but
marvellous
that
he
should
be
able
to
work
the
next
day
without
his
usual
drams
but
it
had
not
convinced
him
that
he
could
do
without
it
all
together
of
its
effect
upon
himself
in
making
him
sullen
morose
and
disagreeable
he
was
in
absolute
ignorance
and
so
the
children
talk
about
it
came
upon
him
as
a
revelation
he
knew
that
tiny
sometimes
shrank
from
and
avoided
him
but
he
had
considered
it
a
mere
childish
whim
not
to
be
accounted
for
by
anything
in
himself
and
so
to
hear
that
she
was
absolutely
afraid
of
him
sometimes
was
something
to
make
him
think
more
deeply
than
he
had
ever
done
in
his
life
before
but
he
did
not
say
a
word
to
tiny
about
this
when
he
had
done
rubbing
his
gun
he
carried
it
home
and
tiny
was
left
free
to
make
acquaintance
with
the
farm
children
she
walked
shyly
up
to
where
they
were
sitting
polly
reading
and
harry
throwing
sand
at
dick
who
had
seated
himself
at
a
short
distance
and
was
returning
the
salute
would
would
you
like
to
tell
me
about
these
letters
please
said
tiny
holding
out
her
paper
to
polly
well
that
a
rum
way
of
asking
said
harry
with
a
laugh
suppose
she
would
now
little
he
added
then
she
must
said
tiny
stoutly
though
the
tears
welled
up
to
her
eyes
at
the
thought
of
all
her
hopes
being
overthrown
just
when
they
seemed
about
to
be
realised
do
harry
what
a
tease
you
are
said
his
sister
i
should
like
to
tell
you
dear
she
added
in
a
patronising
tone
come
and
sit
down
here
and
tell
me
what
you
want
it
what
you
want
do
forget
that
polly
else
she
get
her
back
up
and
go
off
again
laughed
her
brother
but
he
was
not
sorry
the
embargo
had
been
taken
off
their
intercourse
with
the
family
for
although
he
had
had
surreptitious
dealings
with
boys
sometimes
they
had
to
be
so
watchful
lest
they
should
be
discovered
that
the
play
was
considerably
hindered
now
he
understood
that
this
advance
on
tiny
part
was
a
direct
concession
from
coomber
himself
for
he
and
the
boys
had
long
ago
agreed
to
try
and
draw
the
little
girl
into
some
intimacy
as
the
only
way
of
breaking
down
the
restrictions
laid
upon
them
but
tiny
had
proved
obstinate
she
had
been
asked
again
and
again
but
she
had
always
returned
the
same
answer
daddy
would
let
her
some
day
and
then
she
would
play
with
them
so
harry
hayes
was
perfectly
aware
that
she
had
won
the
fisherman
consent
at
last
although
no
word
had
been
said
about
it
when
the
girls
were
left
to
themselves
polly
took
up
the
picture
and
looked
at
it
then
turned
it
over
and
read
god
is
good
to
all
he
loves
both
boys
and
girls
at
this
point
tiny
interrupted
her
by
laying
her
hand
on
her
arm
and
saying
eagerly
are
you
quite
sure
that
is
what
it
says
why
do
you
think
i
can
read
said
polly
in
a
tone
but
the
subject
was
new
to
her
and
so
she
was
anxious
to
read
further
and
turned
to
the
page
again
and
read
on
at
the
bottom
was
a
line
or
two
in
smaller
print
and
polly
read
these
longer
words
with
a
touch
of
pride
jesus
said
suffer
the
little
children
to
come
unto
me
and
forbid
them
not
for
of
such
is
the
kingdom
of
god
then
this
must
be
jesus
and
these
are
the
little
children
concluded
polly
as
she
turned
over
the
paper
to
look
at
the
picture
again
the
two
girls
sat
and
looked
at
it
and
talked
about
it
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
tiny
said
wistfully
will
you
show
me
now
how
you
make
up
them
nice
words
oh
it
easy
enough
if
you
know
the
letters
but
you
must
learn
the
letters
first
said
polly
and
she
proceeded
to
tell
tiny
the
name
of
each
and
the
little
girl
had
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
now
that
she
had
remembered
them
quite
correctly
and
that
g
o
d
did
spell
god
as
she
had
surmised
she
was
not
long
now
in
putting
other
words
together
and
before
she
went
home
she
was
able
to
spell
out
the
first
two
lines
of
the
printed
page
for
they
were
all
easy
words
and
intended
for
beginners
what
a
triumph
it
was
to
tiny
to
be
able
to
read
out
to
the
family
what
she
had
learned
on
the
sands
that
day
she
was
allowed
to
have
the
candle
all
to
herself
after
supper
and
they
sat
round
the
table
looking
at
each
other
in
wondering
amazement
as
her
little
finger
travelled
along
the
page
and
she
spelt
out
the
wonderful
news
is
good
to
all
he
loves
both
boys
and
girls
it
true
dick
what
i
told
you
ai
it
she
said
in
a
tone
of
delighted
satisfaction
dick
scratched
his
head
and
looked
round
at
his
father
wondering
what
he
would
think
or
say
for
a
minute
or
two
the
fisherman
smoked
his
pipe
in
silence
at
length
taking
it
from
his
mouth
he
said
in
a
slow
meditative
fashion
well
little
i
if
it
printed
that
way
it
true
and
if
it
is
why
i
we
all
got
a
share
in
that
of
peace
we
was
talking
about
tiny
did
not
quite
follow
his
train
of
thought
but
she
nodded
her
head
and
then
proceeded
to
tell
them
what
she
had
heard
about
the
picture
and
the
conclusion
she
and
polly
had
arrived
at
upon
the
subject
that
jesus
the
kind
loving
man
of
the
picture
had
come
to
show
them
how
kind
god
was
to
them
illustration
chapter
vi
bad
times
winter
around
bermuda
point
was
at
all
times
a
dreary
season
and
the
only
thing
its
few
inhabitants
could
hope
for
was
that
its
reign
might
be
as
short
as
possible
a
fine
calm
autumn
was
hailed
as
a
special
boon
from
heaven
by
the
all
round
the
coast
and
more
especially
by
the
lonely
dwellers
at
the
point
a
fine
autumn
enabled
coomber
to
go
out
in
his
boat
until
the
time
for
shooting
wild
fowl
began
and
the
children
could
play
on
the
sands
or
gather
samphire
instead
of
being
penned
up
in
the
house
half
the
time
but
when
the
weather
was
wild
and
wet
and
the
salt
marshes
lay
under
water
that
meant
little
food
and
much
discomfort
frequent
quarrels
and
much
bitterness
to
the
fisherman
family
this
autumn
the
weather
was
more
than
usually
boisterous
and
long
before
the
usual
time
the
old
boat
had
to
be
drawn
up
on
to
the
bank
for
fear
the
waves
should
dash
it
to
pieces
the
fisherman
sometimes
went
to
fellness
on
the
chance
of
picking
up
a
stray
job
for
it
was
only
the
state
of
his
boat
and
his
anxiety
to
keep
it
together
as
long
as
possible
that
prevented
him
braving
the
perils
of
the
sea
and
so
he
sometimes
got
the
loan
of
another
boat
or
helped
another
fisherman
with
his
and
then
rough
though
they
might
be
these
were
kind
and
helpful
to
each
other
and
if
they
could
not
afford
to
pay
money
for
a
job
they
could
pay
for
it
in
bread
or
flour
or
potatoes
perhaps
and
so
they
would
generally
find
coomber
something
to
do
that
they
might
help
him
without
hurting
him
but
there
was
little
work
that
could
be
done
in
such
bad
weather
as
this
and
he
knew
it
and
his
proud
independent
spirit
could
not
brook
to
accept
even
a
mouthful
of
bread
that
he
had
not
earned
and
so
there
were
many
weary
days
spent
at
home
or
sauntering
round
the
coast
with
his
gun
on
the
for
a
stray
wild
fowl
tiny
often
went
to
bed
hungry
and
woke
up
feeling
faint
and
sick
and
although
she
never
forgot
to
say
her
prayers
she
could
not
help
thinking
sometimes
that
god
must
have
forgotten
her
she
read
her
paper
to
dick
and
he
and
tom
had
both
learned
to
spell
out
some
of
the
words
and
she
read
to
herself
again
and
again
the
divine
assurance
god
is
good
to
all
he
loves
both
boys
and
girls
but
then
as
dick
said
sometimes
bermuda
point
was
such
a
long
way
from
anywhere
and
he
might
forget
there
were
any
boys
and
girls
living
there
when
she
was
very
hungry
and
more
than
usually
depressed
tiny
thought
dick
must
be
right
but
even
then
she
would
not
admit
such
a
thought
to
others
when
she
saw
coomber
in
tears
because
she
had
no
food
to
prepare
for
her
hungry
children
she
would
steal
up
to
her
pass
her
little
arm
round
the
poor
woman
neck
and
whisper
god
is
good
take
care
of
us
mammy
he
send
us
some
supper
if
he
ca
send
us
any
dinner
and
the
child
hopeful
words
often
proved
a
true
prophecy
for
sometimes
when
coomber
had
been
out
all
day
without
finding
anything
that
could
be
called
food
he
would
when
returning
manage
to
secure
a
wild
duck
perhaps
or
a
couple
of
sea
magpies
or
a
few
young
gulls
nothing
came
amiss
to
the
young
coombers
at
any
time
and
just
now
a
tough
stringy
gull
was
a
dainty
morsel
it
threatened
to
be
an
unusually
hard
and
long
winter
and
at
last
coomber
ventured
to
suggest
that
tiny
should
be
taken
to
the
poorhouse
at
least
until
the
spring
when
she
could
come
back
again
look
at
her
poor
little
white
face
said
the
woman
with
her
apron
to
her
eyes
i
afraid
she
be
ill
soon
and
then
what
can
we
do
time
enough
to
talk
about
that
when
she
is
ill
said
coomber
gruffly
as
he
took
up
his
gun
and
went
out
they
were
generally
able
to
keep
a
good
fire
of
the
and
wreckage
that
was
washed
ashore
for
unfortunately
there
was
scarcely
a
week
passed
but
some
noble
vessel
came
to
grief
on
the
perilous
bar
sands
during
the
more
boisterous
weather
once
when
they
were
at
their
wits
end
for
food
and
bob
had
begged
his
mother
to
boil
some
samphire
for
supper
tiny
was
fortunate
enough
to
discover
an
unopened
cask
which
the
sea
had
cast
up
the
night
before
and
left
high
and
dry
behind
the
ridge
of
sandhills
she
was
not
long
fetching
bob
and
the
boys
to
see
her
treasure
trove
all
sorts
of
wild
speculations
passing
through
her
mind
as
to
what
it
could
contain
as
she
ran
shouting
bob
bob
dick
dick
come
and
see
what
i
found
illustration
dick
come
and
see
what
i
found
page
the
boys
were
not
long
in
making
their
appearance
and
bob
fetched
a
hatchet
and
soon
broke
open
the
cask
and
oh
what
joy
for
the
starving
children
it
was
full
of
ship
biscuits
oh
dick
did
i
tell
you
this
morning
god
had
forgotten
us
said
tiny
in
a
quavering
voice
when
bob
announced
what
the
cask
contained
oh
yes
said
dick
so
you
did
but
he
was
too
hungry
to
think
of
anything
but
the
biscuits
now
too
hungry
even
to
shout
his
joy
as
he
would
have
done
at
another
time
as
soon
as
they
could
be
got
at
he
handed
one
to
tiny
and
then
tom
and
dick
helped
themselves
filling
their
pockets
and
munching
them
at
the
same
time
but
tiny
though
she
nibbled
her
biscuit
as
she
went
ran
at
once
to
tell
coomber
of
her
wonderful
discovery
and
she
scarcely
daring
to
believe
that
such
good
news
could
be
true
ran
out
at
once
to
see
for
herself
and
met
the
boys
who
confirmed
tiny
tale
but
she
must
see
the
cask
for
herself
and
then
she
ate
and
filled
her
apron
and
shed
tears
and
thanked
god
for
this
wonderful
gift
all
at
the
same
time
then
she
told
the
boys
to
come
and
fetch
some
baskets
at
once
to
carry
them
home
in
and
she
would
sort
them
over
for
some
were
soaked
with
but
others
near
the
middle
were
quite
dry
bob
took
a
bagful
and
went
in
search
of
his
father
along
the
coast
and
everybody
was
busy
carrying
or
sorting
or
drying
the
biscuits
for
they
had
to
be
secured
before
the
next
tide
came
in
or
they
might
be
washed
away
again
when
coomber
came
home
bringing
a
couple
of
he
had
shot
he
was
fairly
overcome
at
the
sight
of
the
biscuits
daddy
it
was
god
that
sent
said
tiny
in
an
earnest
joyful
whisper
the
fisherman
drew
his
sleeve
across
his
eyes
seems
as
though
it
must
ha
been
deary
he
said
for
how
that
cask
ever
came
ashore
without
being
broken
up
beats
me
god
did
let
it
break
we
wanted
the
biscuits
said
tiny
confidently
yer
see
daddy
he
ai
forgot
us
though
bermuda
point
is
a
long
way
from
anywhere
the
biscuits
lasted
them
for
some
time
for
as
the
season
advanced
coomber
was
able
to
sell
some
of
the
wild
ducks
he
shot
and
so
potatoes
and
flour
and
bread
could
be
brought
at
fellness
again
if
the
fisherman
could
only
have
believed
that
whisky
was
not
as
necessary
as
bread
they
might
have
suffered
less
privation
but
every
time
he
got
a
little
money
for
his
wild
fowl
the
bottle
had
to
be
replenished
even
though
he
took
home
but
half
the
quantity
of
bread
that
was
needed
and
so
tiny
sometimes
was
heard
to
wish
that
god
would
always
send
them
biscuits
in
a
tub
and
then
daddy
could
drink
the
stuff
that
made
him
so
cross
coomber
smiled
and
sighed
as
she
heard
tiny
whisper
this
to
dick
she
too
had
often
wished
something
similar
or
at
least
that
her
husband
could
do
without
whisky
now
as
the
supply
of
wild
fowl
steadily
increased
he
came
home
more
sullen
than
ever
his
return
from
fellness
grew
to
be
a
dread
even
to
tiny
at
last
and
she
and
dick
used
to
creep
off
to
bed
just
before
the
time
he
was
expected
to
return
leaving
bob
and
tom
to
bear
the
brunt
of
whatever
storm
might
follow
he
seldom
noticed
their
absence
until
one
night
when
having
drunk
rather
more
than
usual
he
was
very
cross
on
coming
in
and
evidently
on
the
for
something
to
make
a
quarrel
over
where
dick
and
the
gal
he
said
as
he
looked
round
the
little
kitchen
after
flinging
himself
into
a
chair
they
gone
to
bed
said
his
wife
timidly
not
venturing
to
look
up
from
her
work
then
tell
to
get
up
i
i
dunno
whether
it
be
good
for
tiny
faltered
the
poor
woman
she
got
a
cold
now
and
and
are
you
going
to
call
up
or
shall
i
go
and
lug
out
of
bed
demanded
the
angry
tipsy
man
but
coomber
began
his
wife
there
do
stand
staring
like
that
but
do
as
i
tell
you
interrupted
the
fisherman
i
wo
have
go
sneaking
off
to
bed
just
as
i
come
home
i
heard
that
little
say
one
day
she
was
afraid
of
me
sometimes
afraid
indeed
i
teach
her
to
be
afraid
he
repeated
working
himself
into
a
passion
over
some
maudlin
recollection
of
the
children
talk
in
the
his
wife
saw
it
would
be
of
no
use
reasoning
with
him
in
his
present
mood
and
so
went
to
rouse
the
children
without
further
parley
they
were
not
asleep
and
so
were
prepared
for
the
summons
as
they
had
overheard
what
had
been
said
oh
mammy
must
i
come
said
tiny
her
teeth
chattering
with
fear
as
she
slipped
out
of
bed
do
be
afraid
deary
do
let
him
see
you
frightened
whispered
coomber
slip
your
clothes
on
as
quick
as
you
can
and
come
and
sing
of
peace
to
him
then
he
drop
off
to
sleep
and
you
can
come
to
bed
again
i
will
i
will
try
said
the
child
trying
to
force
back
her
tears
and
speak
bravely
but
in
spite
of
all
her
efforts
to
be
brave
and
not
look
as
though
she
was
frightened
she
crept
into
the
kitchen
looking
cowed
and
with
terror
and
before
she
could
utter
a
word
of
her
song
coomber
pounced
upon
her
what
do
yer
look
like
that
for
he
demanded
what
business
have
you
to
be
frightened
of
me
tiny
turned
her
white
face
towards
him
and
ventured
to
look
up
i
i
she
going
to
sing
of
peace
interposed
coomber
let
her
come
and
sit
over
here
by
the
fire
you
let
her
alone
roared
her
husband
she
to
do
what
i
tell
her
come
here
he
called
in
a
still
louder
tone
tiny
ventured
a
step
nearer
but
did
not
go
close
to
him
are
you
coming
he
roared
again
then
stretching
out
his
hand
he
seized
her
by
the
arm
and
dragged
her
towards
him
giving
her
a
violent
shake
as
he
did
so
there
now
sing
he
commanded
placing
her
against
his
knee
the
child
stared
at
him
with
a
blank
fascinated
gaze
once
he
saw
her
lips
move
but
no
sound
came
from
them
and
after
waiting
a
minute
he
dashed
her
from
him
with
all
the
strength
of
his
mad
fury
there
was
a
shriek
from
coomber
and
screams
from
the
boys
but
poor
little
tiny
uttered
no
sound
they
picked
her
up
from
where
she
had
fallen
or
rather
had
been
thrown
and
her
face
was
covered
with
blood
but
she
uttered
no
groan
gave
no
sign
of
life
oh
she
dead
she
dead
wailed
dick
bending
over
her
as
she
lay
in
his
mother
arms
the
terrible
sight
had
completely
sobered
coomber
did
i
do
it
did
i
do
that
he
asked
in
a
changed
voice
why
yer
know
yer
did
growled
bob
or
leastways
the
whisky
in
yer
did
it
i
often
thought
you
do
for
mother
or
one
of
us
but
i
never
thought
yer
lift
yer
hand
agin
a
poor
little
like
that
coomber
groaned
but
made
no
reply
hold
your
tongue
bob
commanded
his
mother
for
she
could
see
that
her
husband
was
sorry
enough
now
for
what
he
had
done
what
to
be
done
mother
he
asked
in
a
subdued
voice
surely
surely
i
have
killed
the
child
but
coomber
feared
that
he
had
and
it
was
this
that
paralysed
all
her
faculties
i
do
know
what
to
do
she
said
helplessly
wiping
away
the
blood
that
kept
flowing
from
a
deep
gash
on
tiny
forehead
could
you
give
her
some
water
said
dick
who
did
not
know
what
else
to
suggest
coomber
meekly
fetched
a
cupful
from
the
pan
outside
and
coomber
dipped
her
apron
in
it
and
bathed
tiny
face
and
in
a
minute
or
two
dick
saw
to
his
great
delight
that
she
drew
a
faint
fluttering
breath
coomber
saw
it
too
and
the
relief
was
so
great
that
he
could
not
keep
back
his
tears
please
god
he
spare
us
his
little
i
never
touch
another
drop
of
whisky
he
sobbed
as
he
leaned
over
his
wife
chair
and
watched
her
bathe
the
still
pallid
face
open
the
door
dick
and
let
her
have
a
breath
of
fresh
air
and
stand
too
close
said
his
mother
as
tiny
drew
another
faint
breath
the
door
was
opened
and
the
boys
stood
anxiously
aside
watching
the
faint
gasping
breath
until
at
last
tiny
was
able
to
swallow
a
little
of
the
water
and
then
they
would
have
closed
round
her
again
but
their
mother
kept
them
off
would
a
drop
o
milk
do
her
good
whispered
coomber
after
a
time
but
she
was
sensible
enough
to
recognise
his
voice
and
shuddered
visibly
he
groaned
as
he
saw
it
but
drew
further
back
so
that
she
should
not
see
him
when
she
opened
her
eyes
give
me
the
dick
said
his
mother
when
tiny
had
somewhat
revived
coomber
was
used
to
cuts
and
wounds
and
could
strap
them
up
as
cleverly
as
a
surgeon
it
was
not
the
sight
of
the
ugly
cut
that
had
frightened
her
but
the
swoon
which
she
did
not
understand
how
about
the
milk
mother
coomber
ventured
to
ask
after
forehead
was
strapped
up
and
bandaged
again
came
that
shudder
of
fear
and
the
little
girl
crept
closer
to
the
sheltering
arms
do
be
frightened
deary
daddy
wo
hurt
you
now
do
let
him
come
whispered
tiny
but
coomber
heard
the
whisper
and
it
cut
him
to
the
heart
although
he
kept
carefully
in
the
background
as
he
repeated
his
question
would
yer
like
a
little
milk
deary
asked
coomber
there
ai
no
money
to
buy
milk
said
tiny
in
a
feeble
weary
tone
but
coomber
crept
round
the
back
of
the
kitchen
so
as
to
keep
out
of
sight
took
up
the
bottle
of
whisky
he
had
brought
home
and
went
out
he
brought
a
jug
of
milk
when
he
came
back
you
can
send
for
some
more
and
as
long
as
she
wants
it
he
said
as
he
stood
the
jug
on
the
table
illustration
chapter
vii
a
tea
meeting
tiny
was
very
ill
the
next
day
too
ill
to
get
up
or
to
notice
what
was
passing
around
her
coomber
who
had
had
very
little
experience
of
sickness
was
very
anxious
when
she
saw
tiny
lying
so
quiet
and
the
white
bandage
on
her
forehead
making
her
poor
little
face
look
quite
ghastly
in
its
paleness
the
fisherman
had
crept
into
the
room
before
he
went
out
to
look
at
her
while
she
was
asleep
and
the
sight
had
made
his
heart
ache
i
never
thought
i
could
ha
been
such
a
brute
as
to
hurt
a
little
like
that
he
said
drawing
his
sleeve
across
his
eyes
and
speaking
in
a
whisper
to
his
wife
it
was
the
whisky
said
his
wife
by
way
of
comforting
him
but
coomber
would
not
accept
even
this
poor
comfort
i
was
a
fool
to
take
so
much
he
said
wus
than
a
fool
for
i
knowed
it
made
me
savage
as
a
bear
and
yet
i
let
it
get
the
mastery
of
me
but
it
the
last
mother
i
took
the
bottle
to
the
farm
last
night
and
they
going
to
let
me
have
the
value
of
it
in
milk
for
the
little
and
please
god
she
gets
well
again
it
no
more
whisky
i
touch
it
was
not
easy
for
a
man
like
coomber
to
make
such
a
promise
and
still
more
difficult
to
keep
it
for
the
first
few
days
while
tiny
was
very
ill
it
was
not
so
hard
to
send
bob
and
tom
to
fellness
with
the
teal
and
widgeon
he
had
shot
but
when
she
began
to
get
better
and
the
craving
for
the
drink
made
itself
felt
then
began
the
tug
of
war
during
the
first
few
days
of
the
little
girl
illness
the
fisherman
kept
carefully
out
of
her
sight
though
he
longed
to
see
her
once
more
and
hear
her
say
she
had
forgiven
him
the
cruel
blow
he
had
dealt
to
her
tiny
too
longed
for
him
to
come
and
see
her
in
the
daytime
but
as
it
grew
dusk
the
longing
passed
away
and
every
night
as
the
hour
drew
near
when
he
usually
came
back
from
fellness
a
positive
dread
and
terror
of
him
seized
her
and
she
would
lie
shivering
and
holding
coomber
hand
whenever
she
heard
his
voice
in
the
kitchen
coomber
tried
to
persuade
her
husband
to
go
and
see
the
child
in
the
daytime
but
he
only
shook
his
head
she
hates
me
and
i
deserve
to
see
her
agin
he
said
gloomily
he
returned
the
same
answer
again
and
again
when
pressed
to
go
in
and
see
her
before
he
went
out
with
his
gun
in
the
morning
at
length
as
he
sat
at
breakfast
one
day
he
was
startled
by
tiny
creeping
up
to
him
just
as
she
had
slipped
out
of
bed
oh
daddy
why
did
you
come
to
me
she
said
with
a
little
gasping
sob
throwing
her
arms
round
his
neck
my
deary
my
deary
he
said
in
a
choking
voice
gathering
her
in
his
arms
and
kissing
her
while
the
tears
rolled
down
his
face
oh
daddy
do
you
love
me
said
tiny
that
you
did
come
to
see
me
all
these
days
love
you
my
deary
ah
you
may
well
ask
that
after
what
i
done
to
yer
but
it
was
just
because
i
did
love
yer
that
i
kept
away
from
yer
he
went
on
i
thought
you
never
want
to
see
yer
cruel
old
daddy
any
more
and
as
for
me
why
i
punish
myself
by
not
trying
to
see
yer
or
get
back
your
love
that
just
how
it
was
deary
said
the
fisherman
as
he
looked
tenderly
at
the
little
pallid
face
but
daddy
i
love
you
and
i
wanted
you
all
the
days
said
tiny
nestling
closer
to
him
as
she
spoke
bless
you
deary
i
believe
you
one
of
god
own
bairns
as
well
as
a
sailor
lass
said
coomber
i
wanted
you
all
the
days
daddy
but
but
do
come
at
night
she
added
in
a
hesitating
tone
i
know
what
you
mean
mother
told
me
little
he
said
drawing
his
sleeve
across
his
eyes
and
sighing
i
ca
help
it
daddy
i
ca
help
it
said
the
little
girl
with
a
sob
well
i
not
but
you
need
be
afraid
now
you
know
i
done
with
the
bottle
now
and
it
was
me
you
was
afraid
of
mother
said
but
the
whisky
tiny
nodded
yes
that
it
she
said
and
i
sha
be
afraid
long
if
i
know
you
do
have
it
now
and
from
that
time
the
little
girl
set
herself
strenuously
to
overcome
the
terror
and
dread
that
nightly
crept
over
her
but
still
it
was
some
time
before
she
could
endure
presence
after
dusk
meanwhile
pinching
want
was
again
making
itself
felt
in
the
household
for
some
reason
known
only
to
themselves
the
teal
and
widgeon
did
not
come
within
range
of
the
fisherman
gun
just
now
and
sometimes
after
a
whole
day
spent
in
the
punt
or
among
the
salt
marshes
along
the
coast
only
a
few
unsaleable
old
gulls
would
reward
coomber
toil
they
were
not
actually
uneatable
by
those
who
were
on
the
verge
of
starvation
but
they
were
utterly
unfit
for
a
child
like
tiny
in
her
present
weak
delicate
condition
and
again
the
question
of
sending
her
to
the
poorhouse
until
the
spring
was
mooted
by
coomber
her
husband
did
not
refuse
to
discuss
it
this
time
when
it
was
mentioned
and
it
was
evident
that
he
himself
had
thought
of
it
already
for
he
said
with
a
groan
it
seems
as
though
god
was
going
to
let
me
keep
the
little
though
she
getting
on
a
bit
for
never
have
i
had
such
a
bad
shooting
season
as
this
since
i
knocked
the
little
down
it
seems
hard
mother
what
do
you
think
but
coomber
did
not
know
what
to
think
she
only
knew
that
poor
little
tiny
was
often
hungry
although
she
never
complained
they
had
eaten
up
all
the
store
of
biscuits
by
this
time
and
although
dick
and
tom
often
spent
hours
wandering
along
the
shore
in
the
hope
of
finding
another
wonderful
nothing
had
come
of
their
wanderings
beyond
the
usual
harvest
of
drift
wood
that
enabled
them
to
keep
a
good
fire
in
the
kitchen
all
day
at
length
it
was
decided
that
coomber
should
take
tiny
to
the
poorhouse
and
ask
the
authorities
to
keep
her
until
this
bitter
winter
was
over
and
then
when
the
spring
came
and
the
boat
could
go
out
once
more
he
would
fetch
her
home
again
but
it
was
not
without
many
tears
that
this
proposal
was
confided
to
tiny
the
fisherman
insisting
though
he
shrank
from
the
task
himself
that
she
should
be
told
what
they
thought
of
doing
she
is
a
sailor
lass
and
it
only
fair
to
her
he
said
as
he
left
his
wife
to
break
the
news
to
tiny
she
was
overwhelmed
at
the
thought
of
being
separated
from
those
who
had
been
so
kind
to
her
and
whom
she
had
learned
to
love
so
tenderly
but
with
a
mighty
effort
she
choked
back
her
tears
for
she
saw
how
grieved
coomber
was
though
she
could
not
help
exclaiming
oh
if
god
would
only
let
me
stay
with
you
and
daddy
and
dick
her
last
words
to
dick
before
she
started
were
in
a
whispered
conference
in
which
she
told
him
to
pray
to
god
every
day
to
let
her
come
back
soon
i
will
i
will
said
dick
through
his
tears
i
say
what
you
told
me
last
night
i
say
it
every
day
and
then
coomber
and
tiny
set
out
on
their
dreary
walk
to
fellness
reaching
it
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
bob
and
tom
had
let
their
old
friends
know
that
their
father
had
given
up
the
whisky
and
now
he
foolish
man
felt
half
afraid
and
half
ashamed
to
meet
them
but
he
was
obliged
to
go
for
he
wanted
peters
to
go
with
him
and
tell
the
workhouse
people
about
the
rescue
of
the
little
girl
for
fear
they
should
refuse
to
take
her
in
unless
his
story
was
confirmed
coomber
explained
this
to
his
friend
in
a
rather
roundabout
fashion
for
he
had
not
found
peters
on
the
shore
as
he
had
expected
and
where
he
could
have
stated
his
errand
in
a
few
words
he
had
found
instead
that
all
the
village
was
astir
with
the
news
of
a
that
was
to
take
place
that
afternoon
in
the
chapel
and
that
peters
who
was
something
of
a
methody
as
coomber
expressed
it
had
gone
to
help
in
the
preparations
he
was
astonished
to
see
coomber
when
he
presented
himself
and
still
more
to
hear
the
errand
he
had
come
upon
he
scratched
his
head
and
looked
pityingly
at
the
little
girl
who
held
fast
to
coomber
hand
well
now
mate
i
in
a
fix
he
said
slowly
and
pointing
round
the
room
i
got
all
these
forms
to
move
and
to
fix
up
the
tables
for
by
four
but
if
you
stay
and
lend
a
hand
why
you
and
the
little
be
welcome
to
stay
to
tea
i
know
it
free
to
all
the
village
he
added
and
the
more
that
come
the
better
we
shall
like
it
coomber
looked
at
tiny
and
saw
how
wistfully
her
eyes
rested
on
a
pile
of
cakes
that
stood
near
and
that
look
decided
him
would
you
like
to
have
some
of
it
he
said
with
a
faint
smile
the
little
girl
face
flushed
with
joy
at
the
prospect
of
such
a
treat
oh
daddy
if
i
could
only
take
dick
some
too
she
said
both
the
men
laughed
but
peters
said
well
well
we
see
what
we
can
do
come
in
here
while
daddy
helps
me
with
the
forms
and
he
led
the
way
into
a
small
room
where
several
of
the
fishermen
wives
were
cutting
bread
and
butter
peters
whispered
a
word
to
one
of
them
and
she
seated
tiny
by
the
fire
and
gave
her
some
bread
and
butter
at
once
when
the
tea
was
all
ready
and
the
company
began
to
arrive
coomber
fetched
tiny
to
sit
with
him
and
the
two
had
a
bountiful
tea
and
such
cake
as
the
little
girl
had
not
tasted
for
a
long
time
but
she
would
not
eat
much
she
took
what
was
given
to
her
but
slipped
most
of
it
into
coomber
pocket
that
he
might
take
it
home
to
dick
for
the
little
girl
thought
they
would
go
on
to
the
poorhouse
as
soon
as
tea
was
over
but
while
the
were
being
cleared
away
and
they
were
preparing
for
the
meeting
that
was
to
follow
the
fisherman
drew
her
aside
and
whispered
i
do
believe
god
has
heard
what
you
been
for
deary
for
peters
has
heard
of
a
job
of
work
for
me
since
i
been
here
oh
daddy
and
we
shall
go
home
together
again
exclaimed
tiny
looking
round
for
her
bonnet
at
once
yes
but
not
jest
yet
there
to
be
some
preaching
or
somethin
and
and
little
i
been
a
bad
man
and
i
dunno
as
god
have
anything
to
do
wi
helping
such
a
tough
customer
to
be
any
better
but
if
he
would
and
here
coomber
drew
his
sleeve
across
his
eyes
and
turned
his
head
aside
to
hide
his
emotion
the
little
girl
threw
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
drew
his
face
close
to
hers
oh
daddy
he
will
he
will
she
whispered
earnestly
he
loves
you
and
he
been
waiting
all
this
long
time
for
you
to
love
him
and
you
will
wo
you
now
you
know
but
there
was
no
time
for
coomber
to
reply
for
the
people
were
taking
their
seats
again
and
peters
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
motioning
him
to
do
the
same
the
two
sat
down
feeling
too
eager
for
shyness
or
to
notice
that
others
were
looking
at
them
a
hymn
was
sung
and
a
prayer
followed
and
then
coomber
began
to
feel
disappointed
for
he
was
hungering
to
hear
something
that
might
set
his
doubts
at
rest
at
length
he
heard
the
words
that
have
brought
help
and
gladness
to
so
many
souls
god
so
loved
the
world
that
he
gave
his
only
begotten
son
that
whosoever
believeth
in
him
should
not
perish
but
have
everlasting
life
then
followed
a
simple
address
enlarging
upon
the
text
and
an
exhortation
to
accept
god
offer
of
salvation
the
lord
jesus
christ
himself
said
unto
me
all
ye
that
labour
and
are
heavy
laden
and
i
will
give
you
rest
continued
the
speaker
and
in
his
name
i
beg
each
one
of
you
to
become
reconciled
to
god
he
is
waiting
he
is
willing
to
receive
each
one
of
you
these
were
his
closing
words
and
coomber
who
had
listened
with
eager
rapt
attention
stayed
only
for
the
people
to
move
towards
the
door
and
then
followed
the
speaker
into
the
little
vestry
beg
pardon
sir
he
said
pausing
at
the
door
but
often
as
i
gets
the
chance
of
hearing
such
words
as
i
heard
from
you
and
so
i
hopes
you
forgive
me
if
i
asks
for
a
bit
more
i
a
bad
man
i
begins
to
see
it
all
now
but
but
my
friend
if
you
feel
that
you
are
a
sinner
then
you
are
just
one
of
those
whom
the
lord
jesus
died
to
redeem
he
came
to
seek
and
to
save
those
who
are
lost
to
redeem
them
from
sin
he
gave
his
life
dying
upon
the
cross
a
shameful
painful
death
not
mark
me
that
they
may
continue
in
sin
to
say
we
believe
in
god
and
to
live
in
sin
makes
our
belief
of
no
effect
we
must
learn
of
christ
or
he
will
have
died
in
vain
for
us
we
must
learn
of
him
and
he
will
help
us
to
overcome
our
love
of
drink
our
selfishness
and
sullenness
and
for
the
gentleman
knew
something
of
coomber
and
so
particularised
the
sins
he
knew
to
be
his
easily
besetting
ones
and
you
think
he
help
me
you
see
sir
he
done
a
deal
for
me
lately
bad
as
i
am
said
coomber
twisting
his
hat
in
his
hand
help
you
ah
that
he
will
if
he
gave
his
only
son
what
do
you
think
he
will
withhold
man
is
there
of
you
whom
if
his
son
ask
bread
will
he
give
him
a
stone
or
if
he
ask
a
fish
will
he
give
him
a
serpent
if
ye
then
being
evil
know
how
to
give
good
gifts
unto
your
children
how
much
more
shall
your
father
which
is
in
heaven
give
good
things
to
them
that
ask
him
and
what
are
the
good
things
that
i
to
ask
for
said
coomber
i
know
what
the
asking
means
this
little
here
has
taught
me
that
praying
is
asking
god
and
though
i
ai
never
done
it
afore
begin
now
do
my
man
ask
that
the
holy
spirit
may
be
given
you
to
lead
you
and
teach
you
and
guide
you
into
all
truth
without
his
help
you
can
do
nothing
but
seeking
his
help
trusting
in
his
guidance
you
will
be
enabled
to
overcome
every
difficulty
and
obstacle
however
hard
it
may
be
and
you
think
god
will
forgive
me
all
the
past
my
brother
christ
died
he
shed
his
precious
blood
to
wash
away
our
sin
to
set
our
conscience
free
from
guilt
and
to
assure
us
beyond
a
doubt
of
the
perfect
love
of
god
towards
us
the
words
spoken
fell
into
prepared
soil
for
coomber
had
been
hungering
and
thirsting
after
righteousness
and
he
went
home
that
night
feeling
that
he
had
been
fed
what
a
happy
walk
home
that
was
for
tiny
and
the
fisherman
as
he
left
the
little
chapel
at
fellness
a
basket
well
filled
with
the
odds
and
ends
left
from
the
had
been
handed
to
coomber
to
take
home
and
peters
whispered
as
he
went
out
i
heard
of
another
job
for
yer
so
be
along
in
good
time
in
the
morning
mate
to
describe
coomber
joy
when
her
husband
walked
in
with
tiny
asleep
in
his
arms
and
also
with
the
basket
of
bread
and
butter
would
be
impossible
god
has
given
us
the
little
back
mother
he
said
placing
the
child
in
his
wife
arms
he
been
good
to
me
better
than
i
deserved
only
the
lord
jesus
christ
has
died
for
me
and
that
explains
it
all
his
heart
was
full
of
joy
and
gratitude
and
he
forgot
his
usual
shyness
and
told
his
wife
of
the
good
news
he
had
heard
at
fellness
both
for
body
and
soul
now
mother
he
said
as
he
concluded
you
and
i
must
both
begin
a
new
life
we
must
ask
god
to
help
us
like
this
little
and
we
must
teach
our
boys
to
do
the
same
we
owe
it
all
to
her
he
added
as
he
kissed
tiny
for
if
she
come
among
us
we
might
never
have
heard
about
god
down
here
at
bermuda
point

chapter
viii
brighter
days
the
dreary
winter
came
to
an
end
at
last
and
with
the
first
spring
days
there
was
a
general
bustle
of
preparation
in
the
fisherman
family
for
boat
and
nets
alike
required
overhauling
and
there
would
be
a
good
deal
of
repairing
to
do
before
the
old
boat
would
be
fit
for
further
use
bob
face
was
fast
losing
its
sullen
defiant
angry
look
and
he
was
whistling
as
merrily
as
a
lark
one
morning
when
he
and
coomber
went
to
remove
the
tarpaulin
that
had
been
covered
over
the
boat
during
the
winter
but
the
whistling
suddenly
ceased
when
the
boat
was
uncovered
for
with
all
their
care
the
winter
storms
had
worked
sad
havoc
with
the
little
craft
seams
were
starting
ribs
were
bulging
and
there
were
gaping
holes
that
made
coomber
lift
his
hat
and
scratch
his
head
in
consternation
this
be
a
tough
job
bob
he
said
aye
aye
dad
it
will
that
said
the
lad
carefully
passing
his
finger
down
where
one
rib
seemed
to
be
almost
rotten
a
few
months
before
coomber
would
have
raved
and
blustered
and
sworn
it
was
all
bob
fault
but
since
that
at
fellness
he
had
been
a
changed
man
old
things
had
passed
away
and
all
things
had
become
new
and
none
felt
this
more
than
bob
it
was
a
blessed
change
for
him
and
he
had
given
up
all
thoughts
of
running
away
now
if
the
old
boat
could
only
be
patched
up
and
made
serviceable
but
it
was
a
problem
whether
this
could
ever
be
done
effectually
enough
to
make
it
seaworthy
if
i
only
found
out
ten
years
ago
that
i
could
do
better
without
the
whisky
than
with
it
we
might
ha
got
a
new
boat
afore
this
bob
said
the
fisherman
with
a
sigh
aye
aye
and
had
jack
with
us
too
dad
bob
ventured
to
remark
he
had
not
dared
to
mention
his
brother
name
for
years
but
he
had
thought
a
good
deal
of
him
lately
wishing
he
could
come
home
and
see
the
blessed
change
that
had
been
wrought
in
his
father
the
old
fisherman
lifted
his
head
and
there
was
a
look
of
bitter
anguish
in
his
face
as
he
said
hark
ye
lad
i
give
all
the
days
of
my
life
to
bring
jack
back
the
thought
of
him
is
making
yer
mother
an
old
woman
afore
her
time
and
i
ca
help
it
now
it
too
late
too
late
and
the
old
fisherman
covered
his
face
and
groaned
there
now
father
ai
i
heard
you
say
it
was
never
too
late
to
repent
aye
lad
that
you
have
and
the
precious
blood
of
christ
can
take
away
the
guilt
of
our
sin
but
mark
me
not
even
god
himself
can
do
away
with
the
consequences
of
sin
hard
as
they
may
be
and
truly
and
bitterly
as
we
may
repent
the
past
ca
be
undone
and
as
we
sow
we
must
reap
poor
jack
poor
jack
if
i
could
only
know
where
he
was
why
it
nigh
on
ten
years
since
he
went
away
and
never
a
storm
comes
but
i
thinking
my
boy
may
be
in
it
and
wanting
help
bob
recalled
what
had
passed
on
fellness
sands
the
night
they
rescued
tiny
and
which
had
helped
him
often
since
to
bear
with
his
gruff
sullen
ways
and
fierce
outbursts
of
temper
but
he
would
not
say
any
more
just
now
only
he
thought
that
but
for
that
his
father
would
now
be
mourning
the
loss
of
two
sons
for
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
leave
home
when
it
was
decided
to
take
tiny
to
the
poorhouse
they
were
working
at
the
boat
a
few
days
after
this
caulking
and
plugging
and
tarring
when
tiny
who
had
been
playing
on
the
sandhills
a
little
way
off
came
running
up
breathless
with
some
news
illustration
tiny
and
the
old
man
page
oh
daddy
there
a
little
ugly
old
man
over
there
and
he
says
my
name
is
coomber
is
it
daddy
the
fisherman
lifted
his
hat
and
scratched
his
head
looking
puzzled
strange
to
say
this
question
of
the
little
girl
name
had
never
suggested
itself
to
anybody
before
living
as
they
did
in
this
spot
she
was
tiny
or
deary
or
the
little
and
no
need
had
arisen
for
any
other
name
and
so
after
scratching
his
head
for
a
minute
he
said
well
deary
if
i
your
daddy
i
your
name
is
coomber
but
who
is
the
old
man
he
asked
for
it
was
not
often
that
strangers
were
seen
at
bermuda
point
even
in
i
dunno
daddy
but
he
says
he
knowed
my
mother
when
she
was
a
little
gal
like
me
coomber
dropped
the
he
was
using
and
a
spasm
of
pain
crossed
his
face
had
somebody
come
to
claim
the
child
after
all
he
instinctively
clutched
her
hand
for
a
minute
but
the
next
he
told
her
to
go
home
while
he
went
to
speak
to
the
stranger
he
found
a
little
old
man
seated
on
one
of
the
sandhills
and
without
a
word
of
preface
he
began
you
come
after
my
little
gal
i
the
old
man
smiled
what
your
name
my
man
he
said
taking
out
a
and
preparing
to
write
coomber
coomber
exclaimed
the
old
man
dropping
his
book
in
his
surprise
why
yes
what
should
it
be
said
the
fisherman
did
you
tell
my
little
tiny
that
you
knew
her
name
was
coomber
but
how
you
came
to
know
why
i
never
saw
you
before
that
i
know
of
interrupted
the
other
sharply
so
how
do
you
suppose
i
should
know
your
name
i
told
the
child
i
knew
her
name
was
matilda
coomber
for
she
is
the
very
image
of
her
mother
when
she
was
a
girl
and
she
was
my
only
daughter
oh
sir
and
you
come
to
fetch
her
gasped
the
fisherman
the
stranger
took
out
his
and
helped
himself
to
a
pinch
well
i
do
know
so
much
about
that
he
said
cautiously
i
am
her
grandfather
and
i
thought
when
i
picked
up
that
old
newspaper
the
other
day
and
read
about
her
being
saved
i
just
like
to
come
and
have
a
look
at
her
i
was
pretty
sure
she
was
my
tilly
little
one
by
the
description
of
the
silver
medal
she
wore
for
i
given
it
to
her
mother
just
before
she
ran
away
to
get
married
to
that
sailor
coomber
oh
sir
a
sailor
and
his
name
was
coomber
where
is
he
what
was
he
like
asked
the
fisherman
eagerly
he
was
drowned
before
his
wife
died
she
never
held
up
her
head
afterwards
the
people
tell
me
i
never
saw
her
after
she
was
married
and
swore
i
never
help
her
or
hers
but
when
she
was
dying
she
wrote
and
told
me
she
was
leaving
a
little
girl
alone
in
the
world
and
had
left
directions
for
it
to
be
brought
to
me
after
her
death
with
this
letter
she
sent
her
own
portrait
and
that
of
her
husband
and
child
begging
me
to
keep
them
for
the
child
until
she
grew
up
a
day
or
two
after
came
another
letter
saying
she
was
dead
and
a
neighbour
was
coming
from
grimsby
to
london
by
ship
and
would
bring
the
child
to
me
but
i
never
heard
or
saw
anything
of
either
and
concluded
she
was
drowned
when
about
a
month
ago
an
old
newspaper
came
in
my
way
and
glancing
over
it
i
saw
the
account
of
a
little
girl
being
saved
from
a
wreck
and
where
she
might
be
heard
of
i
went
to
the
place
and
they
sent
me
here
and
the
minute
i
saw
the
child
i
knew
her
for
my
tilly
the
old
man
had
talked
on
but
coomber
had
comprehended
very
little
of
what
was
said
he
stood
looking
for
a
minute
or
two
after
the
stranger
had
ceased
speaking
at
length
he
gathered
his
wits
sufficiently
to
say
have
you
got
them
pictures
now
yes
said
the
old
man
promptly
taking
out
his
as
he
spoke
here
they
are
i
took
care
to
bring
with
me
and
he
brought
out
three
photographs
coomber
seized
one
instantly
it
is
him
it
is
my
jack
he
gasped
oh
sir
tell
me
more
about
him
i
know
nothing
about
him
i
tell
you
said
the
other
coldly
i
never
saw
or
spoke
to
my
daughter
after
she
married
him
but
i
willing
to
do
something
for
the
little
child
seeing
it
was
my
girl
last
wish
the
child
repeated
coomber
do
you
mean
to
say
little
tiny
is
my
jack
child
well
yes
of
course
i
do
what
else
could
i
mean
replied
the
other
then
then
i
her
grandfather
and
have
as
much
right
to
her
as
you
have
said
the
fisherman
quickly
the
stranger
shrugged
his
shoulders
well
i
you
have
he
said
i
not
going
to
dispute
it
i
willing
to
do
my
duty
by
her
but
mind
i
not
a
rich
man
not
a
rich
man
he
added
coomber
was
puzzled
for
a
minute
to
know
what
he
meant
and
was
about
to
say
that
he
wanted
no
payment
for
keeping
tiny
but
the
other
lifted
his
hand
in
a
commanding
manner
and
exclaimed
now
hear
me
first
let
me
have
my
say
and
then
perhaps
we
can
come
to
terms
about
the
matter
you
got
a
wife
i
that
can
look
after
this
child
i
have
and
if
she
came
to
me
i
should
know
what
to
do
with
her
well
now
that
being
the
case
she
better
stay
here
for
the
present
at
least
she
happy
enough
i
and
i
pay
you
twenty
pounds
a
year
as
my
share
towards
her
expenses
coomber
was
about
to
exclaim
indignantly
against
this
and
protest
that
he
would
accept
no
payment
but
just
then
he
caught
sight
of
bob
and
the
old
boat
and
the
thought
of
what
that
money
would
enable
him
to
do
kept
him
silent
a
little
longer
well
now
resumed
the
old
man
if
that
plan
suits
you
we
come
to
business
at
once
you
had
her
about
eighteen
months
now
so
about
thirty
pounds
due
you
see
i
an
honest
man
and
mean
to
do
the
just
thing
by
her
he
added
thirty
pounds
repeated
coomber
to
whom
such
a
sum
seemed
immense
wealth
but
the
other
mistook
the
exclamation
for
one
of
discontent
and
so
he
said
quickly
well
now
i
throw
you
ten
pounds
in
as
i
hear
you
were
the
one
that
saved
her
and
pay
you
the
next
six
months
in
advance
that
make
it
a
round
fifty
but
i
wo
go
a
penny
farther
now
will
that
satisfy
you
satisfy
him
coomber
was
debating
with
himself
whether
he
ought
to
take
a
farthing
considering
what
a
rich
blessing
the
little
girl
had
been
to
him
it
was
only
the
thought
of
the
bitter
winter
they
had
just
passed
through
and
that
if
he
could
get
a
new
boat
he
could
better
provide
for
the
child
that
made
him
hesitate
lest
in
refusing
it
he
should
do
tiny
a
wrong
at
length
after
a
pause
during
which
he
had
silently
lifted
his
heart
in
prayer
to
god
he
said
well
sir
for
the
little
sake
take
your
offer
but
look
you
i
shall
use
this
money
as
a
loan
that
is
to
be
returned
and
as
i
can
save
it
i
shall
put
it
in
the
bank
for
her
the
other
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
can
do
as
you
like
about
that
i
shall
come
and
see
the
child
sometimes
and
do
sir
do
god
bless
her
to
think
she
my
jack
child
interrupted
coomber
drawing
his
sleeve
across
his
eyes
do
you
know
sir
where
my
boy
went
down
he
asked
in
a
tremulous
voice
but
the
other
shook
his
head
i
tell
you
i
know
nothing
of
my
daughter
after
she
married
but
she
sent
me
a
box
with
some
letters
and
these
portraits
and
some
other
odds
and
ends
to
be
kept
for
her
little
matilda
i
send
you
them
if
you
like
and
the
old
man
rose
as
he
spoke
can
you
go
with
me
to
fellness
now
and
settle
this
business
about
the
money
he
added
but
do
you
want
to
see
tiny
exclaimed
coomber
who
could
not
understand
his
willingness
to
give
up
his
claim
to
the
child
i
have
seen
her
we
had
a
long
talk
here
before
you
came
you
may
tell
her
that
her
grandfather
west
will
come
and
see
her
sometimes
and
now
if
you
follow
me
as
quickly
as
you
can
to
the
village
we
settle
this
business
and
as
he
spoke
west
turned
towards
the
road
leaving
coomber
still
with
astonishment
bob
bob
he
called
at
last
i
got
to
go
to
the
village
a
strange
thing
has
happened
here
and
i
want
to
get
my
wits
a
bit
together
before
i
tell
your
mother
but
you
need
do
much
to
the
boat
till
i
come
back
for
it
may
be
we
shall
have
a
new
one
after
all
bob
looked
up
in
his
father
face
speechless
with
surprise
he
spoke
of
having
a
new
boat
as
though
it
was
a
very
sad
business
but
his
next
words
explained
it
i
heard
of
jack
he
said
no
storms
will
trouble
him
again
and
then
the
fisherman
burst
forth
into
sobs
and
groans
and
bob
shed
a
few
tears
although
he
felt
heartily
ashamed
of
them
now
go
back
bob
and
tell
your
mother
i
gone
to
fellness
and
if
i
ai
home
by
five
you
come
and
meet
me
for
i
shall
have
some
money
to
carry
almost
a
fortune
bob
having
heard
so
much
bob
wanted
to
hear
more
and
so
walked
with
his
father
for
the
first
mile
along
the
road
listening
to
the
strange
tale
concerning
tiny
then
he
went
back
and
told
the
news
to
the
astonished
group
at
home
and
so
before
coomber
returned
his
wife
had
got
over
the
first
outburst
of
grief
for
the
death
of
her
son
and
she
and
bob
had
had
time
to
talk
calmly
over
the
whole
matter
they
had
decided
that
the
money
must
be
used
in
such
a
way
as
would
give
the
little
girl
the
greatest
benefit
from
it
and
that
she
must
go
to
school
if
possible
now
if
dad
could
buy
a
share
in
one
of
the
bigger
boats
where
he
and
i
could
work
would
it
be
better
than
buying
a
little
one
for
ourselves
suggested
bob
then
we
could
go
and
live
at
fellness
and
tiny
could
go
to
school
as
well
as
and
dick
too
put
in
tiny
yes
and
we
should
all
go
to
god
house
on
sunday
said
coomber
drying
her
eyes
strange
to
say
a
similar
project
had
been
suggested
to
coomber
by
his
old
friend
peters
who
knew
a
man
who
wanted
to
sell
his
share
in
one
of
the
large
and
was
asking
forty
pounds
for
it
that
will
leave
us
ten
pounds
mother
to
buy
the
children
some
new
clothes
and
take
us
to
fellness
what
do
you
say
to
it
now
asked
her
husband
after
they
had
talked
it
over
why
it
seems
too
good
to
be
true
said
the
poor
woman
through
her
tears
but
oh
if
only
poor
jack
was
here
she
sighed
her
husband
shook
his
head
and
was
silent
for
a
minute
or
two
but
at
length
he
said
god
has
been
very
good
to
us
when
we
had
no
thought
of
him
i
always
knew
the
little
must
be
a
sailor
lass
but
to
think
that
she
should
be
our
jack
own
child
is
wonderful
the
old
gentleman
had
made
quite
sure
of
it
before
he
came
here
he
would
part
with
his
money
unless
he
been
sure
i
know
and
now
she
ours
just
as
much
as
dick
and
bob
is
and
we
take
good
care
of
her
god
bless
her
and
him
for
sending
her
to
us
the
rest
of
my
story
is
soon
told
the
fisherman
and
his
family
removed
to
fellness
and
brighter
days
dawned
for
them
than
they
had
ever
hoped
to
see
when
the
box
arrived
from
west
containing
the
letter
and
papers
relating
to
the
latter
years
of
their
son
life
they
found
that
he
had
become
a
true
christian
through
his
wife
influence
he
had
also
learned
to
read
and
write
and
in
the
last
letter
sent
to
his
wife
before
his
death
he
told
her
he
meant
to
go
and
see
his
parents
as
soon
as
he
returned
from
that
voyage
alas
he
never
did
return
but
the
little
lass
of
whom
he
spoke
so
lovingly
became
god
messenger
to
his
old
home
and
the
joy
and
comfort
of
his
parents
hearts
