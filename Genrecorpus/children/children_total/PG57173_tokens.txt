rock
here
is
the
little
messenger
of
whom
i
told
you
a

girl
at

chapter
i
berry
there
had
been
a
light
fall
of
snow
during
the
night
and
the
tall
oak
trees
that
grew
near
the
arnolds
log
cabin
which
stood
on
the
slope
of
a
wooded
ridge
overlooking
the
tennessee
river
were
still
sprinkled
with
clinging
white
flakes
when
the
heavy
door
of
the
cabin
was
pushed
open
and
a
slender
little
figure
appeared
on
the
rough
porch
if
a
stranger
had
been
passing
along
the
trail
that
led
near
this
secluded
cabin
he
would
perhaps
have
decided
that
it
was
a
boy
who
darted
out
and
jumped
up
and
down
exclaiming
snow
snow
just
like
vermont
snow
for
the
curling
brown
hair
was
cut
short
and
the
blue
flannel
blouse
the
baggy
knickerbockers
of
blue
corduroy
as
well
as
the
stout
leather
shoes
were
all
in
keeping
as
a
suitable
costume
for
a
lad
whose
home
was
a
log
cabin
in
the
rough
region
on
the
westerly
bank
of
the
tennessee
river
over
two
hundred
miles
from
its
mouth
and
when
some
casual
stranger
failing
to
see
the
blue
corduroys
so
mistook
berenice
arnold
and
called
her
my
lad
she
was
very
well
pleased
on
this
january
morning
in
berenice
had
been
awakened
at
an
unusually
early
hour
by
a
call
from
her
father
telling
her
to
dress
quickly
and
hasten
down
in
time
to
see
the
snow
that
lay
like
a
white
veil
over
the
wooded
slopes
before
the
sun
came
out
from
behind
the
distant
mountains
and
swept
it
away
snow
berry
not
enough
for
a
sleigh
ride
but
enough
to
make
you
think
of
vermont
he
had
called
as
if
announcing
an
unexpected
delight
for
the
arnolds
had
only
lived
in
tennessee
for
two
years
berry
was
nine
years
old
when
with
her
father
and
mother
and
her
older
brother
francis
she
had
left
the
big
white
house
in
the
pleasant
vermont
village
near
montpelier
and
come
to
this
hillside
cabin
where
arnold
hoped
to
regain
something
of
his
former
health
and
strength
this
was
the
second
winter
and
this
fall
of
snow
in
early
january
was
the
first
real
snowfall
since
their
arrival
there
had
been
many
flurries
but
until
this
january
morning
not
enough
had
fallen
to
whiten
wood
and
trail
and
the
arnolds
ran
to
door
and
windows
exclaiming
over
the
new
beauty
of
the
slopes
and
forest
beneath
their
white
coverlets
what
would
francis
say
to
this
exclaimed
berry
as
her
father
came
out
and
stood
beside
her
francis
was
now
a
soldier
with
the
northern
forces
in
virginia
and
berry
s
thoughts
were
often
with
her
brother
wondering
why
he
had
been
so
determined
a
year
ago
to
return
to
vermont
and
enlist
in
a
northern
regiment
in
the
conflict
to
prevent
the
southern
states
from
leaving
the
union
and
to
bring
an
end
to
the
slavery
of
the
negroes
in
america
francis
had
been
only
eighteen
when
he
had
become
a
soldier
and
berry
knew
that
her
father
and
mother
had
both
been
willing
that
he
should
go
the
little
girl
had
often
puzzled
about
it
for
she
had
heard
her
father
say
that
when
abraham
lincoln
became
president
the
united
states
would
soon
understand
each
other
and
all
the
talk
of
war
would
come
to
an
end
but
even
lincoln
had
not
been
able
to
avert
the
conflict
and
the
hillside
cabin
ten
miles
distant
from
the
flourishing
town
of
corinth
was
shadowed
by
the
news
of
battles
you
must
write
francis
about
it
responded
berry
s
father
tell
him
the
slope
is
as
white
as
the
main
street
at
home
in
vermont
in
and
berry
nodded
smilingly
it
will
be
gone
before
noon
so
we
can
go
out
to
the
river
road
and
see
what
the
left
for
us
yesterday
continued
arnold
and
if
tis
not
too
muddy
can
we
not
walk
as
far
as
lick
creek
and
try
for
fish
asked
berry
her
brown
eyes
shining
with
eagerness
at
the
thought
of
a
long
tramp
with
her
father
through
the
winter
woods
and
best
of
all
the
fun
of
catching
a
pickerel
or
bass
from
the
waters
of
lick
creek
for
in
the
two
years
that
berry
had
lived
on
this
remote
mountain
slope
she
had
been
her
father
s
constant
companion
in
his
life
and
it
was
for
that
reason
that
her
mother
had
decided
to
dress
the
little
girl
in
suitable
clothing
if
berry
had
been
obliged
to
wear
dainty
clothes
if
her
hair
had
been
long
and
hung
down
her
back
in
curls
or
braids
and
her
feet
covered
only
by
thin
kid
shoes
she
would
never
have
known
every
nook
and
crevice
along
the
rolling
and
ridgy
a
few
miles
above
pittsburg
landing
a
place
that
was
to
become
an
historic
spot
no
fishing
her
father
declared
and
as
at
that
moment
arnold
called
them
to
breakfast
he
did
not
add
that
he
intended
going
in
the
opposite
direction
that
morning
to
visit
the
rude
log
chapel
known
as
shiloh
church
where
sunday
services
were
occasionally
held
and
where
arnold
now
and
then
busied
himself
in
repairing
windows
painting
the
outer
door
and
doing
such
light
work
as
his
strength
was
equal
to
in
improving
the
condition
of
the
neglected
building
berry
was
of
great
assistance
to
her
father
in
this
work
he
had
taught
her
how
to
use
a
plane
and
smooth
off
a
piece
of
wood
until
it
was
fit
for
use
she
knew
the
names
and
use
of
all
the
tools
he
used
about
his
carpentering
work
and
as
a
trip
to
shiloh
church
meant
a
picnic
dinner
cooked
in
the
open
air
berry
was
always
well
pleased
when
her
father
set
off
in
that
direction
and
on
hearing
that
he
intended
to
start
as
soon
as
the
sun
was
well
up
she
quite
forgot
her
plan
to
visit
lick
creek
berry
helped
her
mother
clear
the
table
and
wash
the
dishes
while
her
father
selected
the
few
tools
he
would
need
and
also
packed
a
small
basket
with
food
for
their
midday
meal
and
when
he
called
all
ready
for
the
trail
berry
slipped
on
her
brown
corduroy
jacket
and
her
knitted
cap
of
scarlet
wool
and
was
ready
to
start
if
there
is
a
letter
from
francis
in
the
i
will
bring
it
home
as
fast
as
i
can
mother
she
promised
as
arnold
stood
on
the
porch
to
watch
them
start
we
will
be
home
before
sunset
arnold
promised
and
followed
berry
who
was
running
down
the
trail
arnold
stood
looking
after
them
for
a
moment
smiling
at
berry
s
delight
in
starting
off
for
a
day
in
the
woods
and
thinking
gratefully
of
her
husband
s
improvement
in
health
their
cabin
was
several
miles
from
any
neighbors
and
arnold
had
in
the
first
months
of
their
stay
often
been
homesick
for
the
friends
and
home
she
had
left
so
far
away
among
the
peaceful
hills
of
vermont
but
gradually
the
peace
and
quiet
of
their
simple
life
in
the
hillside
cabin
berry
s
happiness
in
playing
and
best
of
all
the
improvement
in
arnold
s
health
reconciled
her
to
the
exile
from
new
england
often
she
accompanied
her
husband
and
berry
on
their
excursions
but
this
morning
she
intended
writing
a
long
letter
to
her
soldier
son
before
berry
and
her
father
reached
the
that
was
fastened
to
a
stout
oak
tree
on
the
highway
the
veil
of
snow
had
nearly
disappeared
and
the
piles
of
brown
leaves
along
the
trail
glistened
in
the
morning
sun
there
was
nothing
in
the
box
and
arnold
and
berry
turned
back
into
a
path
that
would
lead
them
direct
to
shiloh
church
a
flock
of
bluejays
started
up
from
the
underbrush
and
went
scolding
and
screaming
into
the
branches
of
a
tall
chestnut
tree
their
blue
feathers
and
crested
heads
catching
the
sunlight
and
brightening
the
shadowy
path
berry
gazed
after
them
wonderingly
i
do
think
it
s
a
pity
they
squawk
so
she
said
thoughtfully
when
they
are
so
lovely
to
look
at
and
the
are
so
plain
and
berry
had
become
familiar
with
the
birds
who
nested
near
the
woodland
cabin
and
had
learned
much
about
their
ways
she
knew
that
the
handsome
jay
was
a
thief
who
ate
the
eggs
from
the
nests
of
other
birds
and
sometimes
even
destroyed
the
birds
she
knew
where
the
fine
cardinal
in
his
scarlet
coat
and
madam
cardinal
in
her
more
modest
colors
made
their
nest
in
the
underbrush
along
the
banks
of
the
ravine
and
the
tiny
wrens
who
fluttered
about
the
trail
were
her
friends
but
best
of
all
berry
loved
the
with
their
musical
trills
and
clear
song
even
in
january
they
could
be
heard
near
the
cabin
not
with
their
springtime
song
but
with
soft
notes
and
hopeful
calls
the
little
girl
often
put
bits
of
bread
and
cake
on
the
porch
rail
and
it
was
not
long
before
the
birds
had
discovered
this
unexpected
bounty
and
came
fluttering
down
to
look
for
it
and
gradually
the
family
had
all
made
friends
among
their
bird
neighbors
giving
them
names
and
keeping
a
sharp
outlook
for
the
young
birds
who
were
their
springtime
visitors
what
are
you
going
to
do
father
berry
questioned
as
they
came
in
sight
of
the
log
building
that
stood
on
the
crest
of
the
ridge
i
am
going
to
fix
the
benches
some
of
them
are
dropping
to
pieces
responded
her
father
i
have
a
good
store
of
fine
oak
wood
dry
and
ready
for
use
in
the
shed
near
the
church
and
we
can
soon
make
the
old
seats
as
good
as
and
may
i
put
the
new
rail
on
the
pulpit
i
have
polished
it
until
it
shines
like
glass
said
berry
as
they
came
out
into
the
little
clearing
in
which
the
church
stood
of
course
her
father
agreed
smiling
down
at
his
little
daughter
s
eager
face
he
was
well
pleased
that
berry
found
pleasure
in
the
outdoor
life
that
she
was
learning
to
do
many
things
that
little
girls
seldom
have
an
opportunity
to
learn
and
that
she
was
as
active
and
healthy
as
it
was
possible
for
a
girl
to
be
before
beginning
the
work
he
had
planned
arnold
stood
looking
at
the
wild
country
spread
out
before
him
look
berry
he
said
pointing
to
a
ravine
on
the
left
along
which
ran
the
main
road
to
corinth
this
spot
is
like
a
picture
in
a
frame
he
continued
the
little
streams
of
owl
creek
and
lick
creek
the
road
to
corinth
and
the
tennessee
river
making
the
frame
it
would
make
a
safe
camp
for
an
army
he
added
thoughtfully
but
without
an
idea
that
within
three
months
that
very
spot
would
be
the
scene
of
one
of
the
most
important
battles
of
the
civil
war
or
that
his
little
daughter
who
stood
so
quietly
beside
him
would
by
her
courage
and
endurance
have
rendered
a
great
service
to
the
cause
of
the
northern
forces
they
had
walked
a
long
distance
and
seated
themselves
on
the
broad
step
of
the
chapel
for
a
rest
it
is
nearly
noon
i
ll
start
our
fire
and
get
lunch
under
way
said
arnold
but
berry
was
eager
to
do
this
for
she
knew
exactly
how
to
lay
a
fire
in
the
open
how
to
bake
potatoes
in
hot
ashes
and
to
broil
bacon
over
the
coals
and
to
set
the
tin
pail
in
which
they
made
coffee
where
it
would
boil
slowly
all
right
agreed
arnold
i
ll
fetch
the
berry
ran
along
the
ridge
to
where
a
granite
ledge
made
a
good
shelter
for
a
blaze
and
in
a
short
time
a
little
curl
of
smoke
crept
into
the
air
and
the
appetizing
odor
of
broiling
bacon
and
of
fragrant
coffee
made
arnold
declare
that
he
was
hungry
as
a
bear
greatly
to
berry
s
delight
wouldn
t
it
be
splendid
if
francis
was
here
she
said
as
she
and
her
father
began
their
luncheon
not
much
hope
of
seeing
francis
this
winter
replied
arnold
i
hate
war
berry
declared
breaking
open
a
potato
and
proceeding
to
sprinkle
salt
on
it
if
it
were
not
for
war
francis
would
be
here
this
no
francis
would
be
in
college
her
father
rejoined
what
s
college
berry
demanded
why
berenice
isabel
arnold
exclaimed
her
father
in
amazement
i
will
have
to
turn
schoolmaster
and
keep
you
shut
in
the
house
with
books
if
you
really
do
not
know
the
meaning
of
college
berry
shook
her
head
her
mouth
was
filled
with
hot
potato
and
she
could
not
speak
college
is
a
school
where
young
men
like
francis
learn
more
important
things
than
can
be
taught
to
younger
boys
explained
her
father
and
i
have
made
up
my
mind
berry
your
regular
lessons
oh
father
not
like
the
school
at
home
berry
pleaded
not
geography
and
maps
and
arithmetic
and
sums
and
grammar
and
compositions
exactly
it
will
never
do
for
a
little
yankee
girl
even
if
she
does
live
in
tennessee
to
grow
up
without
an
education
school
will
begin
replied
arnold
then
mollie
bragg
will
have
to
go
to
school
with
me
berry
declared
chapter
ii
mollie
bragg
the
nearest
neighbors
to
the
arnolds
were
a
family
named
bragg
who
lived
in
a
cabin
some
three
miles
distant
near
the
road
leading
to
corinth
the
braggs
cabin
was
not
a
comfortable
convenient
home
such
as
the
arnolds
had
made
their
own
mountain
cabin
the
doors
of
the
braggs
cabin
sagged
from
clumsy
leather
hinges
the
floor
of
the
rough
porch
was
broken
here
and
there
so
that
anyone
entering
the
house
had
to
be
careful
where
he
stepped
bragg
announced
each
day
that
he
was
gwine
ter
try
mighty
hard
to
find
time
to
fix
that
po
ch
an
mend
up
the
but
days
weeks
and
months
went
by
and
no
repairs
were
made
although
bragg
spent
long
hours
on
the
porch
tilted
back
against
the
house
in
an
old
chair
smoking
and
as
he
would
promptly
explain
to
any
visitor
tryin
to
rest
indoors
bragg
swept
and
scoured
mended
the
poor
garments
of
her
family
and
tried
her
best
to
make
the
rough
place
pleasant
for
her
children
mollie
bragg
the
youngest
of
the
family
was
a
little
girl
about
the
age
of
berenice
arnold
but
not
as
tall
or
strongly
built
as
berry
mollie
s
eyes
were
a
pale
blue
her
hair
which
hung
straight
about
her
thin
little
face
was
a
pale
yellow
and
her
arms
and
legs
were
so
thin
that
berry
sometimes
wondered
that
they
did
not
break
as
mollie
ran
down
the
rough
mountain
paths
or
valiantly
followed
berry
in
climbing
a
tall
tree
to
peer
into
the
nest
of
a
robin
or
yellowhammer
mollie
s
elder
sister
had
left
home
the
year
the
arnolds
came
to
tennessee
to
live
with
an
aunt
in
nashville
and
the
only
son
a
lad
of
sixteen
had
run
away
to
join
the
army
of
the
confederacy
so
that
in
january
mollie
was
the
only
child
at
home
although
the
arnold
and
bragg
cabins
were
three
miles
apart
hardly
a
day
passed
that
mollie
and
berry
did
not
see
each
other
mollie
would
often
set
out
early
in
the
morning
and
appear
at
the
arnolds
door
before
they
had
finished
breakfast
to
be
eagerly
welcomed
by
berry
and
urged
to
a
seat
at
the
round
breakfast
table
near
the
big
window
that
overlooked
the
ravine
by
arnold
and
helped
to
the
porridge
followed
by
crisp
bacon
and
toast
and
often
a
dish
of
stewed
fruit
all
of
which
the
little
visitor
evidently
enjoyed
to
mollie
the
arnolds
cabin
seemed
the
finest
place
in
the
world
although
it
had
only
five
rooms
and
the
family
had
their
meals
in
the
kitchen
it
was
indeed
a
pleasant
and
attractive
home
with
its
windows
its
floors
painted
a
shining
yellow
with
rag
rugs
here
and
there
the
open
fire
in
the
that
blazed
so
cheerfully
on
winter
days
the
bookshelves
in
one
corner
and
the
stout
wooden
chairs
and
settles
with
their
big
cushions
arnold
had
spent
a
good
part
of
his
time
in
improving
the
cabin
from
the
rough
state
in
which
they
had
found
it
and
had
made
most
of
the
simple
furniture
a
fence
enclosed
the
yard
where
berry
had
her
own
garden
each
spring
she
began
by
planting
lettuce
and
radishes
and
then
peas
and
carrots
and
string
beans
before
these
had
time
to
sprout
she
had
bordered
her
vegetable
beds
with
spring
flowers
mollie
learned
many
things
from
her
new
friends
and
in
her
turn
showed
berry
where
the
wild
trillium
and
could
be
found
and
where
to
look
for
the
nests
of
cardinal
and
birds
that
the
little
yankee
girl
had
never
seen
before
coming
to
tennessee
therefore
when
arnold
declared
that
it
was
time
for
berry
to
have
regular
lessons
to
begin
school
as
he
termed
it
it
was
quite
natural
for
berry
to
say
that
mollie
bragg
would
also
have
to
study
there
was
no
schoolhouse
within
miles
of
these
mountain
cabins
where
the
little
girls
could
begin
school
and
berry
understood
that
her
father
would
be
her
teacher
and
on
the
day
after
their
excursion
to
shiloh
church
arnold
told
berry
that
she
could
go
to
the
braggs
cabin
and
ask
mollie
to
be
her
schoolmate
tell
her
school
begins
at
ten
o
clock
each
morning
and
closes
at
twelve
he
said
as
berry
put
on
her
cap
and
started
toward
the
door
and
say
to
bragg
that
we
shall
expect
mollie
to
stay
for
dinner
added
arnold
who
realized
that
the
bragg
family
seldom
had
the
kind
of
food
that
would
nourish
a
delicate
child
like
mollie
and
welcomed
the
opportunity
to
give
her
small
neighbor
one
good
meal
each
day
all
right
berry
called
back
as
she
ran
down
the
path
turning
to
wave
her
hand
before
the
thick
growing
forest
trees
hid
her
from
sight
berry
s
way
led
through
the
forest
across
a
wide
brook
that
went
dancing
down
over
its
rocky
bed
toward
the
river
and
then
the
path
turned
into
the
highway
near
which
was
the
rough
clearing
surrounding
the
braggs
cabin
a
tiny
gray
bird
called
as
if
to
greet
the
little
figure
that
ran
so
swiftly
along
the
rough
path
further
on
she
heard
the
cheerful
whistle
of
the
cardinal
and
stopped
for
a
moment
to
look
up
into
the
branches
of
the
big
trees
that
towered
above
her
hoping
for
a
glimpse
of
the
songster
but
he
was
not
to
be
seen
the
crossing
of
the
wide
brook
meant
stepping
carefully
from
stone
to
stone
until
the
middle
of
the
stream
was
reached
where
a
broad
flat
rock
gave
a
firm
foothold
and
from
which
berry
was
accustomed
to
jump
to
the
opposite
bank
she
made
the
passage
skilfully
springing
over
the
rushing
water
and
landing
on
firm
ground
with
the
lightness
and
sure
footing
of
an
active
boy
before
she
had
taken
a
further
step
however
a
chuckling
voice
close
at
hand
called
well
done
youngster
it
takes
a
tennessee
lad
to
jump
and
berry
found
herself
facing
a
tall
man
whose
face
was
nearly
covered
by
a
brown
beard
and
whose
brown
eyes
twinkled
with
amusement
at
her
surprise
he
wore
a
round
cap
of
coonskin
a
leather
jacket
with
stout
trousers
of
corduroy
and
high
boots
a
hunter
s
belt
held
a
revolver
and
and
a
knapsack
was
strapped
across
his
shoulders
it
was
seldom
that
berry
encountered
anyone
in
her
forest
tramps
but
she
had
been
taught
to
believe
in
the
friendliness
of
the
mountain
people
and
smiled
and
nodded
in
response
to
the
man
s
greeting
i
can
jump
farther
than
that
she
boasted
i
can
jump
farther
than
most
boys
of
my
the
man
nodded
approvingly
well
you
ain
t
so
stocky
as
some
he
said
thoughtfully
guess
your
ma
kind
of
likes
to
dress
you
up
don
t
she
sonny
he
continued
with
an
amused
glance
at
berry
s
red
silk
tie
and
scarlet
wool
cap
berry
nodded
if
this
stranger
mistook
her
for
a
boy
she
did
not
mean
to
undeceive
him
well
continued
the
man
you
can
t
help
that
my
lad
what
s
your
name
berry
responded
the
little
girl
berry
what
he
continued
berenice
said
berry
thinking
that
now
the
stranger
had
discovered
her
secret
and
that
he
would
at
once
tell
her
that
the
place
for
little
girls
was
at
home
helping
their
mother
as
bragg
so
often
announced
but
the
man
evidently
had
not
understood
her
nees
eh
berry
nees
well
you
mountain
folks
have
queer
names
but
i
m
glad
to
make
your
acquaintance
i
reckon
you
can
run
considerable
as
well
as
jump
yes
berry
replied
quickly
well
pleased
that
she
need
not
hear
that
girls
should
not
be
running
wild
in
boys
clothes
as
had
sometimes
been
said
to
her
i
can
run
faster
than
len
bragg
who
is
sixteen
years
where
does
len
bragg
live
questioned
the
man
oh
he
s
in
the
war
he
s
with
general
johnston
s
army
replied
berry
promptly
that
s
right
declared
the
man
approvingly
there
s
not
a
finer
man
in
the
confederate
army
than
albert
sidney
berry
had
heard
her
own
father
praise
general
johnston
s
character
so
she
was
not
surprised
and
replied
politely
yes
i
m
bound
for
corinth
myself
continued
the
man
i
ve
journeyed
across
country
from
fort
donelson
and
i
reckon
i
shan
t
stop
long
at
corinth
like
as
not
i
may
come
back
this
way
long
in
the
spring
and
the
man
smiled
to
himself
as
if
well
pleased
with
such
a
prospect
if
i
do
berry
maybe
i
ll
want
you
to
let
me
see
if
you
can
run
as
fast
as
you
say
maybe
i
ll
want
you
to
take
a
message
to
pittsburg
landing
in
a
hurry
for
and
the
man
s
eyes
rested
sharply
upon
berry
before
berry
could
reply
the
man
spoke
again
and
in
a
sharper
tone
than
he
had
yet
used
and
see
here
my
lad
don
t
you
let
on
to
a
living
soul
about
having
met
me
understand
and
his
hand
touched
the
sheath
of
his
in
a
threatening
manner
but
berry
did
not
wait
to
answer
she
was
off
like
a
flash
not
keeping
to
the
path
but
darting
behind
big
trees
circling
around
underbrush
and
at
last
hiding
behind
a
tall
stump
she
heard
the
man
crashing
along
behind
her
but
berry
s
boast
of
being
a
swift
runner
was
well
proved
the
woodsman
could
not
overtake
her
berry
smiled
to
herself
as
she
heard
him
floundering
about
through
the
thickets
she
was
not
at
all
afraid
of
being
caught
for
she
knew
all
the
forest
ways
and
many
a
she
kept
very
quiet
however
and
did
not
venture
out
from
behind
the
stump
until
a
hovering
flock
of
nuthatches
who
had
been
scolding
vigorously
at
being
disturbed
settled
down
in
a
thicket
he
s
gone
she
whispered
and
stepped
cautiously
out
he
didn
t
come
this
way
or
the
nuthatches
would
not
have
stopped
berry
peered
sharply
about
however
as
she
made
her
way
noiselessly
from
tree
to
tree
stopping
often
to
listen
for
any
sound
that
might
mean
she
was
being
followed
but
except
for
the
call
of
woodland
birds
the
forest
was
quiet
berry
was
sure
the
man
had
given
up
trying
to
find
her
and
hastened
down
the
ridge
to
the
braggs
cabin
she
said
nothing
of
her
adventure
to
the
braggs
but
told
of
her
father
s
plan
for
morning
lessons
mollie
may
come
every
day
may
she
not
she
pleaded
and
mother
wants
her
to
stay
for
bragg
s
anxious
face
had
brightened
as
berry
spoke
of
lessons
and
she
answered
quickly
i
reckon
prayers
are
answered
fer
i
ve
been
a
hopin
and
a
prayin
there
d
be
some
chance
for
mollie
to
get
but
no
way
seemed
to
open
and
now
your
folks
come
along
an
want
to
teach
her
of
course
she
can
come
an
mighty
thankful
fer
the
chanst
and
bragg
wiped
her
faded
eyes
with
the
corner
of
her
worn
apron
and
managed
to
smile
at
mollie
who
was
jumping
up
and
down
as
if
too
happy
to
keep
still
bragg
had
started
off
to
look
after
the
traps
he
set
along
the
river
banks
for
muskrats
whose
skins
he
sold
to
a
trader
in
corinth
so
there
was
no
argument
about
the
foolishness
of
for
bragg
often
proudly
announced
that
he
never
had
no
schoolin
an
never
was
any
the
wus
fer
it
without
any
idea
that
his
poverty
and
laziness
had
been
caused
by
his
ignorance
school
begins
berry
added
at
ten
o
what
will
we
learn
mollie
asked
eagerly
her
pale
blue
eyes
shining
with
delight
berry
shook
her
head
i
don
t
know
i
expect
it
will
be
a
surprise
i
don
t
believe
it
will
be
like
a
real
school
she
replied
mollie
s
smile
vanished
to
go
to
a
real
school
seemed
the
finest
thing
in
the
world
to
the
little
mountain
girl
who
had
not
even
known
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
until
berry
had
taught
them
to
her
and
who
could
now
at
ten
years
of
age
only
read
words
of
one
syllable
and
was
just
beginning
to
learn
the
meaning
of
figures
berry
was
quick
to
notice
the
change
in
mollie
s
expression
and
added
i
mean
we
won
t
sit
behind
little
desks
and
keep
as
quiet
as
mice
the
way
girls
do
in
p
raps
we
will
mollie
rejoined
hopefully
p
raps
i
ll
learn
writin
of
course
you
will
berry
declared
and
mollie
s
smile
promptly
reappeared
may
i
spin
this
morning
berry
asked
going
toward
the
big
that
stood
in
one
corner
of
the
kitchen
on
which
bragg
spun
the
yarn
for
the
stockings
worn
by
the
family
and
often
permitted
berry
to
spin
the
soft
fleecy
rolls
of
wool
into
yarn
berry
always
considered
this
permission
a
great
privilege
and
her
father
had
promised
to
make
a
for
her
usually
bragg
was
quite
ready
to
let
berry
try
her
hand
at
the
wheel
but
this
morning
she
shook
her
head
dolefully
the
wheel
s
give
out
she
declared
steve
promised
to
take
a
look
at
it
but
land
knows
when
he
ll
get
round
to
berry
approached
the
big
wheel
and
looked
at
it
anxiously
what
s
the
matter
with
it
she
asked
twon
t
move
and
to
prove
this
bragg
touched
the
rim
of
the
wheel
that
usually
responded
to
the
lightest
touch
but
now
kept
firm
and
steady
berry
had
watched
her
father
in
his
work
with
tools
had
seen
him
oil
hinges
that
would
not
move
or
loosen
nuts
that
held
some
wheel
or
bar
too
tightly
and
she
had
been
taught
to
do
many
things
that
most
little
girls
never
learn
so
now
she
examined
the
wheel
with
so
serious
a
face
that
bragg
looked
at
her
in
amazement
if
i
had
a
and
an
i
believe
i
could
fix
it
she
declared
fer
the
land
s
sake
muttered
bragg
we
never
saw
a
but
there
s
a
broken
knife
that
ll
twist
a
screw
mighty
perhaps
that
would
do
berry
responded
gravely
and
mollie
ran
off
to
find
the
broken
knife
while
berry
peered
under
the
to
make
sure
that
she
understood
the
simple
movement
of
the
wheel
bragg
watched
berry
as
the
little
girl
carefully
loosened
and
adjusted
the
axle
on
which
the
wheel
turned
until
it
would
move
but
it
did
not
move
smoothly
it
needs
a
drop
of
oil
berry
announced
but
the
bragg
cabin
could
furnish
nothing
better
than
a
bit
of
melted
tallow
and
bragg
declared
that
far
superior
to
oil
and
hastened
to
prepare
it
and
at
last
to
the
amazement
and
delight
of
bragg
and
mollie
and
to
berry
s
great
satisfaction
the
big
wheel
revolved
as
swiftly
as
ever
i
reckon
you
know
ter
do
sich
things
berry
on
account
of
being
a
yankee
girl
bragg
declared
admiringly
steve
says
folks
up
north
prides
theirselves
on
workin
an
on
inventin
ways
ter
make
work
i
declar
to
it
i
ll
have
ter
rest
a
spell
and
bragg
sank
down
on
a
wooden
bench
near
the
door
maw
tell
berry
that
story
you
tole
me
bout
the
selfish
mouse
said
mollie
maw
kin
tell
gran
stories
berry
the
little
girl
continued
eagerly
w
en
we
wus
off
up
in
the
mountains
she
used
ter
tell
a
new
one
mos
every
berry
s
face
brightened
at
the
prospect
of
a
story
and
bragg
said
she
would
tell
it
as
nearly
as
she
could
remember
it
it
s
bout
a
mouse
that
jes
was
set
on
gettin
all
he
could
fer
hisself
she
explained
this
mouse
lived
with
his
mother
an
four
brothers
in
a
fine
cabin
whar
thar
was
a
big
cupboard
thar
was
cakes
an
cheese
an
nice
white
bread
an
cold
meat
an
like
as
not
thar
was
raisins
an
nuts
in
that
thar
cupboard
but
the
door
was
allers
kep
shut
tight
an
thar
was
a
big
white
cat
that
seemingly
was
allers
lurkin
roun
that
pantry
door
so
mother
mouse
warned
her
children
to
be
satisfied
with
the
crumbs
they
could
pick
up
roun
the
kitchen
but
one
day
one
of
the
little
mice
found
that
the
door
was
open
and
he
slipped
in
an
twa
n
t
a
minute
afore
that
little
mouse
found
a
big
round
cheese
an
began
to
nibble
it
an
he
was
so
busy
and
so
happy
that
he
didn
t
hear
the
cupboard
door
shut
or
notice
that
twas
dark
wal
mother
mouse
didn
t
miss
him
fer
a
considerable
spell
bein
busy
collectin
grain
jest
outside
the
cabin
but
when
it

mother

goes
all
about
the
kitchen
calling
the
missing
mouse
an
when
she
crept
by
the
cupboard
she
heard
a
little
bit
of
a
squeak
and
then
she
stopped
mighty
quick
she
knew
the
little
mouse
was
in
that
cupboard
an
she
prob
ly
knew
that
thar
war
traps

she
began
to
nibble
at
the
edge
of
the
door
and
the
little
mice
did
their
best
to
help
her
and
jes
fore
daylight
there
was
a
hole
big
enough
for
the
little
mouse
to
come
through
but
he
wouldn
t
come
says
he
i
only
squeaked
so
you
d
know
that
i
m

to
gather
kitchen
crumbs

he
says
an
so
you
can
all
go
your
ways
an
ferget
an
he
ran
back
to
his
cheese
wal
at
that
very
minute
the
woman
of
the
house
came
into
the
kitchen
to
light
up
the
fire
an
she
sees
the
mice
my
land
she
calls
out
an
off
went
mother
mouse
and
all
her
family
into
a
safe
but
the
woman
opened
the
cupboard
door
and
then
she
called
puss
puss
an
the
big
cat
came
running
an
into
the
pantry
she
sprung
an
the
little
mouse
who
had
felt
so
grand
and
had
scorned
his
own
folks
who
were
tryin
ter
help
him
was
so
stupid
and
clumsy
because
he
had
eaten
so
much
that
he
couldn
t
run
and
in
a
minute
the
cat
had
grabbed
him
and
fetched
him
out
to
the
kitchen
an
ate
him
up
thar
bragg
concluded
i
guess
i
ll
hev
to
stir
up
a
corn
pone
fer
dinner
and
she
got
up
from
the
bench
what
became
of
the
mother
mouse
and
the
other
little
mice
berry
demanded
but
bragg
shook
her
head
i
reckon
they
jes
moved
away
she
said
it
was
now
nearly
noon
and
berry
realized
that
she
must
get
home
as
soon
as
possible
so
reminding
mollie
that
school
would
begin
the
next
morning
she
bade
them
as
soon
as
she
had
left
the
bragg
cabin
berry
s
thoughts
flew
back
to
the
man
she
had
encountered
that
morning
although
she
had
not
spoken
of
him
to
bragg
for
some
reason
that
she
could
not
easily
account
for
she
was
now
eager
to
reach
home
and
tell
her
father
and
mother
of
the
stranger
who
had
taken
her
for
a
boy
and
who
had
threatened
her
i
ll
go
home
another
path
she
decided
i
never
want
to
see
that
man
again
and
she
made
her
way
up
the
crest
of
the
ridge
circling
about
thick
growths
of
trees
and
underbrush
and
coming
into
the
trail
that
led
to
the
cabin
a
mile
above
the
place
where
she
had
encountered
the
stranger
chapter
iii
school
it
was
with
a
grave
face
that
arnold
listened
to
berry
s
story
of
her
morning
s
adventure
at
the
brook
and
her
mother
instantly
declared
that
berry
could
no
longer
run
about
alone
the
man
was
probably
a
confederate
spy
she
said
anxiously
and
if
he
had
discovered
that
a
family
from
new
england
were
living
near
by
that
instead
of
being
a
little
boy
of
tennessee
you
were
a
little
yankee
girl
we
can
not
tell
what
would
have
yes
i
believe
the
man
has
been
traveling
along
the
cumberland
and
tennessee
rivers
looking
over
the
confederate
line
of
defense
and
his
saying
he
might
return
this
way
in
the
spring
may
mean
that
the
confederates
fear
an
attack
will
be
made
upon
fort
henry
or
fort
donelson
if
the
union
army
could
capture
these
forts
and
open
the
tennessee
and
cumberland
rivers
the
confederate
line
of
defense
would
be
destroyed
said
arnold
thoughtfully
and
arnold
instantly
added
we
surely
need
not
fear
any
battle
taking
place
near
this
remote
spot
but
with
spies
everywhere
we
must
take
all
possible
precautions
i
hope
you
did
not
tell
the
braggs
of
meeting
a
stranger
berry
she
added
no
i
didn
t
tell
bragg
i
don
t
know
why
i
didn
t
berry
responded
thoughtfully
i
guess
i
was
really
frightened
after
all
and
didn
t
want
bragg
to
know
nonsense
berry
said
arnold
sharply
you
could
run
away
from
anyone
and
if
you
blew
your
whistle
even
if
you
were
too
far
away
for
me
to
hear
and
come
to
your
assistance
it
would
make
any
dangerous
person
sure
that
help
was
close
at
hand
and
would
probably
frighten
him
berry
s
father
did
not
like
the
idea
of
the
little
girl
going
about
in
fear
he
knew
it
would
destroy
all
her
pleasure
in
the
free
woodland
life
which
they
had
all
taken
so
much
happiness
in
the
whistle
of
which
he
spoke
had
been
a
gift
to
berry
from
her
brother
francis
it
was
a
silver
whistle
attached
to
a
long
silver
chain
that
berry
always
wore
about
her
neck
with
the
whistle
tucked
into
the
pocket
of
her
blouse
during
the
first
year
in
the
cabin
arnold
had
not
been
sufficiently
strong
to
walk
far
and
it
was
francis
who
had
chopped
the
wood
for
the
cabin
fires
journeyed
to
corinth
for
necessary
provisions
and
fished
for
bass
and
pickerel
along
the
river
and
berry
had
often
been
his
companion
he
had
given
her
the
whistle
so
if
she
lost
sight
of
him
in
the
woodland
trails
she
could
instantly
call
him
and
berry
valued
it
more
than
anything
else
and
never
left
the
cabin
without
it
nothing
more
was
said
that
day
in
regard
to
the
stranger
but
in
the
afternoon
arnold
started
off
into
the
forest
telling
berry
that
he
thought
she
would
better
stay
and
keep
her
mother
company
he
followed
the
trail
to
the
braggs
cabin
and
made
his
way
for
some
distance
up
the
stream
where
berry
had
encountered
the
stranger
but
he
found
nothing
to
cause
alarm
and
was
tempted
to
believe
that
after
all
the
man
might
have
been
only
a
woodsman
journeying
across
country
who
had
thought
it
an
amusing
game
to
frighten
the
small
boy
for
whom
he
had
mistaken
berry
as
he
walked
along
the
ridge
and
down
the
slope
to
his
cabin
arnold
thought
to
himself
that
as
his
wife
had
said
that
noon
however
the
conflict
went
between
the
armies
of
the
north
and
the
south
there
was
small
danger
of
its
coming
nearer
to
shiloh
church
than
the
defensive
line
of
the
confederates
at
the
river
forts
and
which
stretched
on
through
kentucky
from
the
mississippi
river
to
the
cumberland
mountains
the
control
of
this
defense
was
in
the
hands
of
general
albert
sidney
johnston
a
man
respected
alike
by
his
opponents
and
his
soldiers
his
line
of
defense
included
fort
henry
on
the
right
bank
of
the
tennessee
and
fort
donelson
on
the
left
bank
of
the
cumberland
river
and
arnold
was
confident
that
general
ulysses
grant
the
commander
of
union
forces
in
the
west
would
not
long
delay
in
an
attempt
to
conquer
these
river
strongholds
with
those
forts
destroyed
grant
s
army
could
soon
break
the
whole
western
line
of
defense
reflected
arnold
little
realizing
that
within
a
month
this
very
thing
would
be
accomplished
before
arnold
reached
home
the
sky
filled
with
heavy
clouds
and
it
began
to
snow
glad
berry
is
indoors
he
thought
as
he
approached
the
cabin
and
saw
the
dancing
blaze
of
the
fire
shine
out
through
the
windows
berry
and
her
mother
were
on
the
settle
beside
the
fire
busy
with
sewing
it
looks
just
like
my
things
only
smaller
said
berry
holding
up
a
blue
serge
blouse
only
mollie
s
suit
is
a
skirt
and
blouse
instead
of
knickerbockers
her
mother
smilingly
reminded
her
well
mollie
would
like
knickerbockers
but
her
father
never
would
let
her
wear
them
said
berry
why
does
bragg
think
i
ought
to
wear
long
calico
skirts
i
wonder
i
could
not
run
or
climb
trees
or
jump
across
brooks
if
i
wore
skirts
mollie
is
always
tearing
hers
and
tumbling
down
when
she
runs
after
mr
bragg
doesn
t
really
think
my
dear
he
simply
echoes
responded
arnold
but
i
am
sure
mollie
will
like
her
new
won
t
she
be
surprised
mother
to
have
a
birthday
party
and
on
the
very
day
school
begins
the
minute
bragg
said
that
january
tenth
was
mollie
s
birthday
i
thought
i
d
make
her
a
present
but
it
was
you
who
thought
of
a
party
and
berry
gazed
admiringly
at
her
pretty
smiling
mother
who
was
always
thinking
of
such
interesting
things
for
little
girls
to
do
for
it
was
arnold
who
had
suggested
ripping
up
a
blue
serge
skirt
of
her
own
and
making
a
blouse
and
skirt
of
it
for
mollie
but
it
was
berry
who
with
her
mother
s
help
had
cut
out
blouse
and
skirt
and
who
had
stitched
the
seams
and
embroidered
a
star
in
red
worsted
on
the
corners
of
the
collar
when
the
arnolds
came
to
tennessee
they
had
brought
a
good
store
of
clothing
but
they
had
not
believed
a
great
war
was
so
close
at
hand
a
war
that
was
to
impoverish
the
southern
states
and
to
make
it
nearly
impossible
for
people
to
procure
suitable
clothing
and
at
the
close
of
their
second
year
in
their
mountain
cabin
the
arnolds
began
to
realize
that
they
must
take
good
care
of
their
garments
as
they
could
not
purchase
new
material
in
the
town
of
corinth
with
the
braggs
conditions
were
more
difficult
as
they
had
never
possessed
decent
clothing
such
dresses
as
bragg
had
managed
to
secure
for
herself
and
mollie
were
worn
to
rags
arnold
had
given
bragg
a
dress
of
stout
gingham
but
poor
little
mollie
ran
about
in
a
thin
worn
calico
arnold
was
teaching
the
little
girl
to
knit
a
jacket
for
herself
of
the
fine
blue
yarn
that
her
mother
spun
and
with
a
dress
of
serge
mollie
would
soon
be
comfortably
clothed
when
the
last
stitches
were
set
and
mollie
s
dress
was
quite
finished
berry
carried
the
serge
blouse
and
skirt
into
her
own
room
which
opened
from
the
and
that
was
as
pleasant
a
chamber
as
any
little
girl
could
ask
the
floor
of
the
room
like
all
the
cabin
floors
was
painted
yellow
the
walls
and
ceiling
were
boarded
with
pine
whose
soft
color
blended
with
the
floor
arnold
and
francis
had
built
this
room
on
to
the
cabin
and
its
wide
window
overlooked
the
deep
ravine
toward
lick
creek
but
a
tall
oak
tree
grew
so
close
to
the
cabin
on
this
side
as
to
hide
the
little
building
from
sight
and
when
berry
looked
from
her
window
she
looked
out
between
the
branches
of
the
trees
toward
rough
banks
and
wooded
ridges
arnold
had
made
the
simple
white
bedstead
that
stood
in
berry
s
room
and
the
over
which
hung
a
small
square
mirror
and
francis
had
built
the
which
arnold
had
covered
with
flowered
chintz
which
she
had
brought
with
her
from
the
north
and
had
made
curtains
for
the
window
of
the
same
material
a
white
rug
of
sheepskin
lay
beside
the
bed
and
there
was
a
chest
of
drawers
in
one
corner
of
the
room
and
a
small
wooden
painted
white
berry
put
mollie
s
new
dress
in
the
lower
drawer
of
the
wide
chest
and
looked
at
it
admiringly
then
from
a
far
corner
of
the
drawer
she
took
a
long
package
wrapped
in
a
piece
of
tissue
and
wrapping
paper
were
not
easy
to
obtain
in
that
part
of
the
world
in
unrolled
it
and
a
small
doll
appeared
a
doll
made
of
cloth
whose
hair
was
of
yarn
raveled
from
the
foot
of
an
old
brown
stocking
whose
eyes
were
black
buttons
and
whose
scarlet
mouth
had
been
marked
by
beet
juice
the
doll
wore
a
gay
dress
made
of
bits
of
yellow
silk
from
arnold
s
her
feet
were
covered
with
kid
shoes
made
from
a
glove
and
the
little
hat
tied
on
with
a
bit
of
yellow
silk
berry
had
made
by
plaiting
dried
grasses
mollie
will
like
this
doll
too
berry
thought
happily
as
she
returned
the
package
to
its
former
place
i
wish
there
were
some
other
little
girls
to
ask
to
her
birthday
party
she
thought
recalling
her
former
playmates
of
the
vermont
village
where
a
birthday
party
had
meant
the
gathering
of
at
least
a
dozen
little
girls
all
in
pretty
dresses
and
each
bringing
a
gift
for
the
girl
whose
birthday
they
were
celebrating
berry
smiled
to
herself
as
she
glanced
down
at
her
stout
leather
boots
and
baggy
knickerbockers
they
would
all
think
my
clothes
as
queer
as
bragg
does
she
thought
recalling
the
full
flounced
skirts
and
embroidered
pantalettes
that
she
had
worn
before
coming
to
shiloh
snow
continued
to
fall
during
the
night
so
that
mollie
s
feet
were
wet
and
her
faded
skirt
more
drabbled
and
limp
than
usual
when
she
reached
the
arnolds
cabin
the
next
morning
an
old
brown
shawl
of
bragg
s
covered
her
head
and
shoulders
and
one
end
of
it
trailed
behind
her
as
she
entered
the
pleasant
kitchen
arnold
took
off
mollie
s
shawl
as
she
welcomed
their
little
visitor
and
berry
ran
for
a
pair
of
moccasin
slippers
that
arnold
had
made
from
tanned
sheepskin
and
in
a
few
moments
mollie
s
wet
shoes
had
been
set
to
dry
and
she
was
following
berry
through
the
to
berry
s
chamber
looking
about
as
she
always
did
with
admiring
eyes
at
the
simple
comforts
of
a
home
so
different
from
the
braggs
dark
squalid
cabin
do
you
remember
what
day
this
is
mollie
berry
demanded
as
they
entered
her
room
mollie
nodded
eagerly
as
she
smiled
radiantly
up
at
her
friend
deed
i
does
it
s
the
day
school
begins
she
responded
her
pale
eyes
shining
with
delight
and
what
else
questioned
berry
mollie
s
smile
faded
and
her
face
grew
anxious
i
dunno
berry
it
s
snowing
you
don
t
mean
that
do
you
she
questioned
and
berry
gave
a
gay
little
laugh
and
leaning
toward
her
kissed
mollie
s
cheek
saying
happy
birthday
mollie
bragg
here
you
are
eleven
years
old
and
you
forgot
all
about
it
mollie
looked
at
her
friend
with
wide
eyes
i
most
always
fergits
it
she
replied
i
guess
nobody
ever
said
happy
birthday
to
me
well
i
ll
always
say
it
to
you
after
this
always
berry
declared
if
i
go
back
to
vermont
and
can
t
it
i
ll
write
it
she
promised
and
it
was
a
promise
she
remembered
and
fulfilled
after
the
two
little
girls
were
separated
by
the
long
distance
between
vermont
and
tennessee
as
berry
spoke
she
turned
toward
the
chest
of
drawers
and
said
birthdays
mean
presents
and
here
are
your
birthday
presents
from
mother
and
me
and
berry
drew
forth
a
little
petticoat
of
soft
gray
flannel
one
that
she
had
formerly
worn
and
the
blue
serge
blouse
and
skirt
slip
off
your
dress
mollie
and
we
ll
see
if
they
fit
urged
berry
laying
the
garments
on
her
bed
and
before
mollie
had
recovered
from
her
surprise
she
found
herself
dressed
in
the
warm
petticoat
and
the
pretty
serge
dress
and
berry
was
tying
one
of
her
own
scarlet
neckties
under
the
wide
sailor
collar
of
the
blouse
there
mollie
look
at
yourself
and
berry
swung
mollie
about
in
front
of
the
small
mirror
where
the
little
girl
gazed
admiringly
at
her
new
appearance
then
with
a
sober
face
she
began
to
untie
the
strip
of
scarlet
silk
and
to
unfasten
the
blouse
don
t
take
them
off
mollie
exclaimed
the
astonished
berry
you
are
to
wear
them
are
they
mine
truly
asked
mollie
as
if
unable
to
believe
that
she
could
really
own
such
beautiful
apparel
of
course
they
are
yours
i
helped
to
make
them
but
it
was
mother
who
planned
them
responded
berry
exclaimed
mollie
but
before
she
could
say
anything
more
a
bell
in
the
tinkled
sharply
school
father
is
waiting
berry
exclaimed
laughingly
and
putting
her
arm
about
the
little
figure
she
drew
mollie
toward
the
door
chapter
iv
a
cabin
party
there
was
nothing
in
the
arnolds
that
january
morning
to
remind
berry
of
a
schoolroom
unless
it
was
the
little
brass
bell
that
stood
on
the
table
beside
which
arnold
sat
berry
was
so
much
in
advance
of
mollie
in
the
usual
school
lessons
that
her
father
realized
it
would
be
difficult
to
teach
the
two
little
girls
at
the
same
time
the
slate
berry
had
used
in
the
village
school
in
vermont
and
a
box
of
slate
pencils
lay
on
the
table
and
a
large
atlas
opened
at
a
map
of
the
united
states
was
spread
out
beside
it
while
arnold
intended
that
berry
should
have
a
proper
knowledge
of
grammar
and
mathematics
he
felt
that
she
should
understand
something
of
the
government
under
which
she
lived
and
this
morning
he
called
the
girls
to
look
at
the
map
of
the
united
states
thinking
it
a
good
plan
for
both
the
girls
to
learn
the
names
and
location
of
the
various
states
of
the
union
where
s
shiloh
questioned
mollie
gazing
wonderingly
at
the
brightly
colored
spaces
on
the
map
which
arnold
pointed
out
as
the
different
states
of
the
union
poor
little
shiloh
isn
t
even
a
village
mollie
it
is
only
the
name
of
a
log
church
on
a
mountain
ridge
in
tennessee
he
responded
but
before
the
year
ended
shiloh
was
known
all
through
the
country
as
the
name
of
the
place
of
one
of
the
most
terrific
battles
of
the
civil
war
and
had
become
an
historic
spot
here
is
tennessee
continued
arnold
and
this
blue
line
is
the
tennessee
river
along
here
and
with
a
pencil
he
pointed
out
the
course
of
the
broad
stream
it
sweeps
for
many
miles
along
the
boundary
line
of
alabama
then
turns
northerly
in
this
great
curve
and
flows
past
fort
henry
and
pours
its
waters
into
the
ohio
river
right
here
is
pittsburg
both
the
little
girls
exclaimed
at
this
familiar
name
for
pittsburg
landing
was
not
many
miles
distant
and
was
the
point
where
the
river
steamers
landed
freight
for
corinth
eighteen
miles
distant
before
the
morning
lesson
hours
were
over
mollie
had
learned
that
washington
was
the
capital
of
the
united
states
where
laws
for
the
government
of
the
union
were
made
that
the
terrible
war
between
the
southern
and
northern
states
with
francis
arnold
in
the
northern
army
and
len
bragg
with
the
southern
troops
meant
that
the
south
wished
to
secede
to
leave
the
union
and
form
a
new
government
if
the
northern
armies
won
the
negroes
would
be
freed
and
the
north
and
south
remain
a
united
nation
if
the
south
conquered
the
north
slavery
would
continue
and
there
would
be
two
separate
governments
my
pa
says
the
south
will
win
mollie
announced
he
says
they
beat
the
yankees
at
bull
run
she
continued
yes
the
southern
troops
are
valiant
fighters
arnold
agreed
for
he
never
forgot
that
the
union
had
been
formed
by
south
and
north
alike
and
he
hoped
earnestly
for
a
peace
that
would
again
unite
them
in
a
firm
and
lasting
friendship
then
while
berry
was
learning
the
rules
of
a
lesson
in
algebra
mollie
happily
began
her
first
effort
in
writing
the
slate
and
pencil
seemed
a
wonderful
thing
to
the
little
mountain
girl
and
she
patiently
endeavored
to
copy
the
lines
and
letters
that
arnold
traced
for
her
the
clock
struck
twelve
and
arnold
again
tinkled
the
small
brass
bell
and
said
smilingly
pupils
are
expected
to
be
in
the
schoolroom
at
ten
sharp
as
he
finished
speaking
the
door
into
the
kitchen
opened
and
arnold
said
this
is
mollie
s
birthday
dinner
party
so
she
must
lead
the
way
to
the
mollie
whispered
softly
to
herself
a
little
flush
creeping
over
her
thin
face
as
berry
gave
her
a
gentle
push
toward
the
kitchen
where
the
round
table
was
spread
for
four
and
where
mollie
s
chair
held
the
newspaper
bundle
containing
the
doll
mollie
bragg
always
remembered
her
eleventh
birthday
and
she
always
treasured
the
cloth
doll
the
only
one
she
ever
owned
and
which
she
at
once
named
mrs
there
were
broiled
partridge
for
dinner
that
arnold
had
shot
in
the
ravine
two
days
before
and
baked
potatoes
there
were
spiced
pears
that
arnold
had
put
up
the
previous
autumn
and
crisp
hot
rolls
and
steaming
chocolate
a
great
luxury
and
then
a
marvelous
thing
happened
when
mollie
believed
that
the
dinner
was
quite
over
and
was
again
holding
mrs
arnold
and
almost
too
happy
to
believe
in
so
much
good
fortune
arnold
went
to
the
pantry
and
came
back
bringing
a
round
cake
on
which
stood
eleven
tiny
pink
lighted
candles
again
murmured
mollie
as
arnold
set
this
wonderful
creation
in
front
of
her
little
guest
your
birthday
cake
mollie
wish
wish
for
something
splendid
then
try
to
blow
all
the
candles
out
with
one
breath
like
this
and
berry
puffed
out
her
cheeks
and
blew
so
strongly
that
the
little
flames
wavered
if
all
the
candle
flames
go
out
your
wish
will
come
true
before
your
next
birthday
berry
concluded
earnestly
mollie
promptly
obeyed
berry
s
directions
with
such
good
success
that
every
tiny
flame
was
extinguished
goody
goody
but
you
mustn
t
tell
your
wish
until
next
birthday
cautioned
berry
running
around
the
table
and
carefully
removing
the
candles
from
the
cake
they
were
the
same
candles
that
had
been
used
on
berry
s
own
cake
on
her
eleventh
birthday
in
october
and
they
were
now
carefully
put
away
for
who
could
tell
when
it
would
again
be
possible
to
purchase
wax
candles
then
arnold
helped
mollie
cut
the
cake
and
at
the
first
taste
mollie
smiled
more
radiantly
than
ever
but
quickly
put
the
piece
back
on
her
plate
don
t
you
like
it
mollie
berry
asked
anxiously
it
s
beautiful
mollie
replied
soberly
but
i
m
goin
ter
take
it
home
ter
ma
may
i
she
added
a
little
doubtfully
the
whole
cake
is
yours
mollie
dear
but
you
must
eat
the
first
piece
yourself
arnold
said
quickly
you
are
to
take
the
remainder
mollie
drew
a
long
breath
i
reckon
my
ma
never
tasted
a
birthday
cake
she
said
soberly
after
dinner
was
over
and
mollie
had
seen
arnold
put
the
cake
carefully
into
a
small
basket
which
she
told
the
little
girl
she
was
to
carry
home
berry
and
mollie
went
back
to
the
and
berry
brought
out
her
own
two
fine
dolls
which
had
heads
of
china
with
black
curls
painted
on
them
and
were
dressed
in
white
muslin
and
wore
sashes
of
blue
silk
berry
had
brought
these
dolls
from
vermont
and
one
was
named
josephine
maria
for
berry
s
grandmother
arnold
who
had
given
the
dolls
to
berry
and
the
other
was
called
maria
josephine
then
you
see
neither
one
can
be
the
favorite
berry
explained
as
she
set
the
dolls
side
by
side
in
her
father
s
big
chair
now
let
s
play
it
s
a
real
party
my
dolls
and
your
doll
can
be
real
girls
and
we
ll
talk
for
them
she
continued
mollie
nodded
with
smiling
delight
and
for
an
hour
or
more
the
two
little
friends
and
their
dolls
played
happily
but
as
the
clock
struck
three
mollie
announced
that
she
must
start
for
home
it
gets
shadowy
and
kinder
fearsome
in
the
woods
come
late
afternoon
she
said
and
my
pa
says
that
niggers
are
runnin
off
every
little
while
and
maybe
are
hid
up
in
the
woods
so
i
d
be
skeered
to
go
home
don
t
be
afraid
of
any
poor
colored
man
or
woman
who
might
be
coming
over
the
ridge
mollie
said
arnold
gently
you
mean
niggers
questioned
the
little
girl
and
then
added
quickly
oh
arnold
i
never
knew
how
grand
it
would
be
to
be
eleven
years
old
and
have
a
birthday
cake
and
a
doll
and
a
dress
and
she
looked
from
one
gift
to
another
with
so
radiant
a
face
that
arnold
felt
well
rewarded
for
her
friendly
efforts
for
her
small
neighbor
s
happiness
berry
had
slipped
on
her
cap
and
coat
and
was
ready
to
go
part
of
the
way
home
with
mollie
just
as
they
had
started
mollie
suddenly
turned
back
and
running
to
arnold
she
looked
up
at
her
and
said
earnestly
i
been
tryin
to
say
thank
but
tain
t
enough
to
say
fer
all
you
give
me
tain
t
enuff
jes
ter
say
thank
you
indeed
it
is
enough
dear
mollie
responded
arnold
leaning
down
to
kiss
the
little
face
now
flushed
with
the
joy
of
her
happy
birthday
arnold
stood
in
the
doorway
of
the
cabin
and
watched
the
two
little
girls
until
the
forest
shut
them
from
view
the
snow
had
all
vanished
the
winter
sun
still
shone
warmly
above
the
and
only
the
caws
of
a
passing
flock
of
crows
disturbed
the
perfect
quiet
of
the
scene
chapter
v
lily
although
arnold
had
told
mollie
there
was
no
need
to
fear
the
fugitive
negroes
who
now
and
then
made
their
way
across
the
mountains
hoping
to
find
freedom
from
slavery
in
the
northern
states
the
little
girl
s
words
made
arnold
thoughtful
supposing
a
fleeing
tennessee
slave
appealed
to
her
for
a
or
for
assistance
to
escape
into
kentucky
which
remained
loyal
to
the
union
while
tennessee
was
a
confederate
state
what
could
she
do
and
arnold
both
realized
that
even
on
that
remote
mountain
ridge
the
fact
that
they
were
from
the
north
that
their
son
was
a
soldier
in
the
northern
army
would
naturally
prejudice
southerners
against
them
and
if
any
member
of
the
little
household
was
discovered
befriending
a
fleeing
in
those
days
was
regarded
as
a
piece
of
property
by
his
master
and
could
be
dragged
back
into
would
place
them
in
a
dangerous
position
she
spoke
of
it
to
her
husband
but
arnold
saw
no
cause
for
uneasiness
of
course
if
any
human
being
came
to
our
door
in
need
we
would
have
to
do
what
we
could
for
him
especially
if
it
were
a
black
man
or
woman
for
they
have
never
had
a
fair
chance
in
this
country
and
we
are
bound
to
help
them
i
do
not
think
there
are
half
a
dozen
people
beside
the
braggs
who
know
anything
about
us
and
they
are
our
friends
he
concluded
mr
bragg
declares
he
doesn
t
care
which
side
wins
responded
arnold
he
says
he
is
neutral
and
that
is
why
he
is
so
angry
at
len
s
running
away
to
join
the
confederate
army
but
i
don
t
quite
trust
steve
while
and
arnold
discussed
the
questions
that
were
then
causing
so
much
trouble
berry
and
mollie
had
reached
the
brook
and
were
saying
berry
had
carefully
explained
just
how
mollie
s
doll
had
been
made
i
spread
out
a
piece
of
white
cloth
doubled
and
marked
a
doll
out
with
a
piece
of
charcoal
and
then
cut
it
out
and
stitched
the
two
pieces
together
just
leaving
a
place
open
on
top
of
the
head
and
then
filled
her
with
sawdust
sewed
up
the
open
place
and
covered
her
head
with
raveled
yarn
said
berry
p
raps
i
can
make
one
mollie
suggested
hopefully
of
course
you
could
berry
agreed
promptly
i
ll
make
a
black
nigger
doll
so
s
mrs
arnold
can
have
it
for
a
slave
said
mollie
oh
mollie
you
can
t
that
s
what
this
war
is
about
to
make
white
people
stop
making
slaves
of
black
people
it
isn
t
fair
declared
berry
and
quickly
added
mollie
why
don
t
you
give
your
doll
an
easier
name
i
don
t
know
any
names
i
loves
your
ma
an
i
loves
this
doll
so
i
calls
the
doll
mrs
arnold
mollie
responded
soberly
an
i
don
see
no
harm
in
makin
a
nigger
well
mollie
my
mother
s
name
is
ellen
why
don
t
you
call
the
doll
that
berry
suggested
oh
yes
ellen
is
lovely
mrs
arnold
your
name
is
ellen
mollie
promptly
informed
her
doll
holding
it
out
at
arm
s
length
that
she
might
better
admire
it
i
ll
start
back
now
said
berry
school
is
going
to
be
fine
isn
t
it
mollie
mollie
vigorously
nodded
her
head
it
s
grand
she
declared
and
then
coming
very
close
to
berry
she
whispered
i
ve
got
a
secret
maybe
i
can
tell
it
to
you
and
before
berry
had
time
to
question
her
mollie
had
taken
the
basket
that
held
the
precious
birthday
cake
and
started
to
cross
the
brook
making
her
way
carefully
from
stone
to
stone
she
did
not
leap
from
the
broad
stone
to
the
opposite
bank
as
berry
delighted
in
doing
but
followed
the
until
the
stream
was
safely
crossed
then
she
turned
and
called
to
berry
who
had
stood
waiting
to
be
sure
that
mollie
crossed
the
stream
in
safety
i
m
all
right
berry
she
called
i
think
it
s
fine
to
be
what
s
the
secret
mollie
berry
called
back
but
mollie
had
turned
and
was
hurrying
off
toward
home
berry
looked
after
the
little
figure
in
the
trailing
shawl
until
it
vanished
in
the
forest
path
and
then
turned
and
ran
lightly
up
the
ridge
a
cold
wind
crept
among
the
branches
of
the
tall
oaks
as
berry
ran
a
rabbit
leaped
out
from
the
underbrush
and
sped
along
before
her
for
a
short
distance
and
then
vanished
squirrels
scolded
noisily
from
the
oak
trees
and
from
the
deep
woods
berry
could
hear
the
distant
call
of
some
bird
but
the
little
girl
hardly
noticed
these
familiar
sounds
of
the
forest
i
wonder
what
mollie
s
secret
can
be
she
thought
and
resolved
to
start
out
and
meet
mollie
the
next
morning
then
she
can
tell
me
before
she
decided
berry
had
just
reached
this
conclusion
when
her
quick
eye
caught
the
movement
of
a
dark
object
behind
the
underbrush
that
bordered
the
path
a
fox
maybe
she
thought
stopping
to
look
more
closely
at
the
dark
form
as
she
looked
the
figure
raised
itself
from
behind
the
underbrush
and
berry
gave
a
startled
exclamation
for
it
was
not
a
fox
or
any
woodland
animal
that
confronted
her
but
a
young
negro
girl
evidently
more
frightened
than
berry
and
it
was
berry
who
spoke
first
what
are
you
hiding
there
for
berry
demanded
come
out
in
the
path
where
i
can
see
there
were
few
negroes
near
shiloh
and
since
coming
to
live
in
the
mountain
cabin
the
little
yankee
girl
had
seldom
encountered
them
but
she
knew
that
tennessee
was
a
state
where
negroes
were
considered
as
the
property
of
white
masters
that
negroes
possessed
no
rights
in
regard
to
protection
from
cruelty
and
injustice
if
they
were
fortunate
in
belonging
to
a
kind
master
and
there
were
many
such
throughout
the
slaveholding
states
they
were
well
treated
but
if
owned
by
cruel
ignorant
men
the
negroes
were
abused
and
it
was
from
such
unfair
treatment
that
they
frequently
endeavored
to
escape
by
fleeing
north
but
unless
they
could
reach
canada
there
was
no
safety
for
them
in
the
northern
states
as
the
law
of
the
union
then
gave
their
masters
the
right
to
pursue
them
and
force
them
to
return
to
end
this
injustice
was
one
of
the
chief
reasons
for
the
civil
war
as
berry
looked
at
the
frightened
black
face
that
peered
at
her
above
the
underbrush
she
instantly
realized
that
this
was
a
runaway
slave
and
she
again
called
come
out
in
the
path
where
i
can
see
you
and
now
the
negro
girl
crept
out
from
her
and
stood
facing
berry
oh

she
faltered

so

i
won
t

kotched
and
she
fixed
her
big
eyes
pleadingly
on
berry
s
face
her
thin
form
clad
in
a
ragged
garment
made
of
coarse
bagging
material
shivering
in
the
cold
i
m
a
girl
berry
announced
you
can
t
hide
out
in
the
woods
it
s
too
cold

she
added
quickly
and
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
me
i
ll
help
the
negro
girl
stared
at
berry
as
if
even
more
frightened
than
before
wot
yo
dressed
up
dis
way
for
she
asked
never

about

berry
replied
but
do
as
i
say
if
you
will
come
with
me
you
can
have
something
warm
to
eat
and
drink
anyway
then
if
you
want
to
keep
on
running
away
you
for
a
moment
the
little
white
girl
rosy
well
clad
and
unafraid
and
the
gaunt
frightened
black
girl
faced
each
other
then
a
softer
expression
crept
over
the
face
of
the
negro
girl
and
she
took
a
step
toward
berry
i
se
gwine
ter
trus
yo
young
she
said
softly
berry
nodded
nobody
shall
hurt
you
she
promised
soberly
and
let
s
run
or
father
will
be
coming
to
find
but
the
negro
girl
shook
her
head
dolefully
i
cyan
t
run
young
my
feetes
is
hurt
and
now
for
the
first
time
berry
noticed
that
the
girl
s
legs
were
bare
and
that
her
feet
were
protected
from
the
rough
frozen
ground
only
by
worn
pieces
of
cloth
tied
about
with
string
and
at
this
berry
exclaimed
pityingly
your
poor
feet
well
we
ll
go
easy
and
she
clasped
the
girl
s
thin
arm
and
started
forward
the
negro
girl
did
not
speak
again
until
they
came
in
sight
of
the
cabin
then
she
stopped
suddenly
yo
ain
gwine
ter
let
nobuddy
sen
me
back
ter
alabamy
she
asked
fearfully
berry
s
clasp
on
the
girl
s
arm
tightened
i
am
going
to
help
you
i
am
going
to
be
your
friend
she
promised
earnestly
and
the
slave
girl
meeting
the
pitying
friendly
glance
of
berry
s
brown
eyes
was
convinced
that
the
impossible
had
happened
that
a
runaway
slave
girl
had
really
found
a
friend
from
that
moment
she
had
full
confidence
in
berry
whatever
berry
told
her
to
do
she
did
instantly
sure
that
no
harm
could
befall
her
as
long
as
berry
was
near
what
is
your
name
berry
asked
as
they
reached
the
porch
my
name
s
berry
pushed
open
the
door
into
the
kitchen
still
clasping
her
companion
s
arm
mother
here
is
lily
she
announced
chapter
vi
secrets
arnold
was
busy
at
the
kitchen
table
when
berry
s
announcement
here
is
lily
caused
her
to
turn
toward
the
door
and
it
was
small
wonder
that
for
a
moment
she
was
too
surprised
at
the
sight
that
confronted
her
to
speak
but
she
quickly
realized
what
had
happened
that
berry
had
encountered
a
fugitive
slave
girl
and
brought
her
to
the
cabin
and
poor
lily
s
frightened
pleading
eyes
as
well
as
her
trembling
form
instantly
appealed
to
arnold
s
sympathies
come
right
to
the
fire
lily
she
said
kindly
and
berry
you
would
better
heat
some
milk
at
arnold
did
not
ask
any
questions
she
could
see
that
the
negro
girl
was
worn
out
by
fatigue
hunger
and
cold
and
promptly
began
to
make
her
comfortable
bringing
a
warm
blanket
from
the
little
chamber
off
the
kitchen
where
francis
had
formerly
slept
and
wrapping
it
about
the
girl
who
silent
and
still
inclined
to
be
afraid
sat
stiffly
on
the
wooden
kitchen
chair
near
the
stove
berry
had
instantly
slipped
off
her
cap
jacket
and
mittens
and
put
on
a
long
gingham
apron
that
at
once
changed
her
appearance
from
that
of
a
slender
alert
boy
to
a
little
girl
and
as
the
shivering
lily
watched
her
new
friend
set
a
small
dipper
filled
with
milk
on
the
stove
and
hurry
back
to
the
pantry
for
bread
which
she
proceeded
to
toast
and
liberally
spread
with
butter
lily
s
face
softened
and
she
became
sure
that
this
wonderful
little
person
who
had
brought
her
to
warmth
and
shelter
and
promised
to
protect
her
was
really
a
girl
lily
ate
ravenously
the
hot
milk
and
buttered
toast
disappeared
so
quickly
that
berry
hurried
to
the
pantry
for
the
remains
of
the
partridge
left
from
dinner
and
for
more
bread
and
a
new
supply
of
milk
all
of
which
the
negro
girl
devoured
i
ain
t
et
rael
food
fer
days
she
whispered
looking
up
at
berry
an
i
neve
spected
i
d
hev
a
chanst
ter
eat
while
berry
was
providing
food
for
this
unexpected
visitor
arnold
had
filled
a
big
kettle
with
water
and
set
it
on
the
stove
to
heat
the
door
into
francis
s
room
was
open
and
arnold
had
placed
a
small
tub
there
and
by
the
time
lily
s
appetite
was
satisfied
the
water
was
ready
and
the
tub
filled
taking
soap
and
towels
arnold
told
the
negro
girl
to
follow
her
and
the
surprised
lily
was
soon
after
introduced
to
the
first
hot
bath
of
her
life
then
clad
in
a
warm
flannel
wrapper
she
curled
up
on
the
cot
bed
and
was
fast
asleep
when
arnold
returned
to
the
kitchen
berry
told
her
mother
the
story
of
finding
the
fugitive
slave
girl
hiding
on
the
side
of
the
ridge
and
arnold
listened
with
a
grave
face
it
was
so
cold
mother
and
she
was
so
shivery
and
frightened
i
had
to
bring
her
home
and
you
said
that
of
course
we
must
help
anyone
who
needed
help
berry
pleaded
half
afraid
by
her
mother
s
serious
face
that
she
did
not
approve
of
berry
s
having
brought
the
negro
girl
home
of
course
berry
dear
you
did
exactly
right
it
has
begun
to
snow
again
and
the
poor
creature
would
have
perished
if
you
had
not
brought
her
to
shelter
she
looks
and
arnold
wondered
to
herself
at
the
courage
of
this
young
slave
girl
who
had
started
out
in
midwinter
facing
the
dangers
of
the
forest
of
hunger
and
cold
and
of
probable
pursuit
capture
and
punishment
rather
than
remain
a
slave
but
you
look
as
if
you
wished
i
hadn
t
mother
said
berry
do
i
and
arnold
smiled
at
berry
s
troubled
expression
well
my
dear
i
was
wondering
what
we
can
do
with
lily
you
know
slaveholders
always
try
to
find
a
runaway
negro
and
if
lily
s
owner
comes
after
her
and
finds
her
here
he
would
have
a
right
to
take
her
that
is
the
law
and
we
could
not
prevent
her
it
s
a
horrid
law
berry
declared
and
her
mother
promptly
agreed
but
mother
perhaps
lily
s
master
may
not
even
try
to
find
her
and
then
lily
can
stay
here
the
little
girl
continued
hopefully
and
arnold
assented
saying
we
will
see
what
father
says
when
he
comes
in
of
course
the
girl
must
stay
here
for
the
arnold
had
gone
to
the
little
clearing
further
down
the
ridge
where
stood
the
rough
log
shelter
that
he
had
built
for
the
cow
and
when
he
entered
the
cabin
berry
and
her
mother
were
eager
to
tell
him
of
berry
s
encounter
with
the
negro
girl
and
that
berry
had
promised
to
befriend
her
and
had
brought
her
home
and
greatly
to
berry
s
delight
and
to
the
relief
of
arnold
he
did
not
appear
to
be
greatly
troubled
by
lily
s
presence
in
the
cabin
we
ll
find
out
more
about
her
when
the
girl
is
well
rested
very
likely
her
owner
won
t
bother
to
look
for
her
he
said
but
i
don
t
know
what
we
can
do
with
her
he
added
oh
father
there
are
lots
of
things
lily
could
do
berry
assured
him
eagerly
quite
as
if
she
had
known
the
negro
girl
all
her
life
and
and
arnold
smiled
at
their
little
daughter
s
evident
adoption
of
the
fleeing
lily
the
wind
thrashing
among
the
branches
of
the
forest
trees
and
the
cold
rain
that
had
followed
the
fall
of
snow
made
the
blazing
fire
in
the
arnolds
seem
even
more
pleasant
than
usual
that
evening
as
berry
drew
her
small
near
the
hearth
berry
s
thoughts
were
occupied
with
lily
she
was
sure
that
lily
must
have
had
wonderful
adventures
and
looked
forward
to
hearing
them
she
had
entirely
forgotten
mollie
s
secret
and
was
earnestly
planning
how
lily
could
be
provided
with
clothing
while
berry
s
thoughts
were
filled
by
this
new
adventure
that
had
befallen
her
and
arnold
were
talking
of
the
union
armies
and
of
the
troops
under
general
ulysses
grant
a
quiet
unostentatious
officer
whose
name
was
to
be
linked
with
the
mightiest
achievements
of
the
civil
war
grant
s
soldiers
are
now
on
their
first
campaign
untrained
and
unused
to
war
but
most
of
them
are
from
the
west
hardy
and
brave
and
if
grant
moves
against
forts
henry
and
donelson
it
will
open
the
cumberland
and
tennessee
rivers
and
carry
forward
the
union
front
of
war
two
hundred
miles
general
grant
would
have
foote
s
fleet
of
on
the
river
to
make
victory
sure
declared
arnold
if
the
tennessee
is
once
opened
there
will
be
conflicts
near
pittsburg
landing
at
even
nearer
to
us
than
that
responded
arnold
anxiously
arnold
acknowledged
that
might
be
possible
but
even
so
we
could
not
be
in
a
safer
place
than
in
this
mountain
ravine
an
army
might
march
by
on
the
corinth
road
or
arrive
at
pittsburg
landing
without
troubling
us
i
am
much
more
anxious
about
berry
s
adventures
with
these
wanderers
along
the
trails
than
i
am
about
armies
and
battles
coming
to
shiloh
he
said
and
at
the
sound
of
her
own
name
berry
jumped
up
and
ran
to
the
big
settle
where
her
mother
and
father
were
sitting
what
army
father
she
asked
general
grant
s
army
of
west
tennessee
and
the
confederate
army
of
albert
johnston
replied
her
father
are
you
going
to
meet
strange
woodsmen
or
fleeing
negroes
every
time
you
leave
the
house
he
added
smiling
down
at
berry
s
serious
face
i
wish
spring
would
come
i
m
tired
of
winter
said
berry
it
won
t
be
long
now
her
mother
declared
if
the
weather
turns
warm
after
this
storm
the
catkins
will
begin
to
show
on
the
alder
bushes
the
wild
geese
will
come
flying
over
and
spring
will
be
close
at
hand
but
it
s
bedtime
berry
dear
so
say
and
be
may
i
peek
in
and
see
if
lily
is
asleep
asked
berry
and
at
her
mother
s
smiling
nod
the
little
girl
ran
to
open
the
door
into
the
little
room
where
the
negro
girl
slept
in
safety
the
arnolds
had
finished
breakfast
the
next
morning
before
there
was
any
sound
in
the
adjoining
chamber
arnold
had
selected
some
garments
for
the
negro
girl
and
in
a
little
while
lily
appeared
in
the
kitchen
a
very
different
lily
from
the
ragged
frightened
lily
that
berry
had
brought
home
she
was
eager
to
help
in
the
work
of
the
cabin
and
before
the
hour
for
lessons
arrived
arnold
realized
that
lily
had
been
well
trained
as
a
house
servant
do
not
ask
lily
any
questions
berry
her
mother
cautioned
wait
until
she
is
ready
to
tell
us
her
story
and
berry
a
little
reluctantly
agreed
for
she
was
eager
to
hear
of
lily
s
journey
and
of
her
escape
from
slavery
at
ten
o
clock
the
little
bell
tinkled
warningly
and
berry
hastened
to
the
mollie
has
not
come
she
announced
we
will
have
to
plan
extra
studies
for
pupils
who
are
late
or
absent
said
arnold
oh
father
you
said
that
just
like
a
real
teacher
said
berry
are
we
not
going
to
wait
for
mollie
no
indeed
you
and
i
will
read
a
while
replied
arnold
opening
a
book
on
the
table
berry
looked
at
him
questioningly
but
reading
isn
t
lessons
father
it
s
just
fun
she
said
a
little
note
of
reproach
in
her
voice
listen
to
this
and
then
when
i
finish
repeat
as
much
of
it
as
you
can
remember
responded
arnold
smilingly
pansies
lilies
kingcups
daisies
let
them
live
upon
their
praises
long
as
there
s
a
sun
that
sets
primroses
will
have
their
glory
long
as
there
are
violets
they
will
have
a
place
in
story
there
s
a
flower
that
shall
be
mine
tis
the
modest
father
that
s
not
a
lesson
i
can
say
it
all
declared
berry
and
indeed
she
could
so
well
had
her
memory
been
trained
in
this
very
way
repeat
wordsworth
s
beautiful
lines
without
a
mistake
the
lesson
in
algebra
followed
and
the
morning
hours
of
study
ended
without
mollie
appearing
probably
she
doesn
t
want
to
come
said
arnold
but
berry
and
her
mother
were
sure
that
was
not
the
reason
that
kept
mollie
away
may
i
go
down
and
find
out
why
she
did
not
come
asked
berry
as
she
sat
down
at
the
dinner
table
no
i
m
not
willing
for
you
to
go
down
the
trail
said
arnold
quickly
perhaps
mollie
will
appear
this
perhaps
she
will
agreed
berry
hopefully
and
i
guess
she
will
be
surprised
to
see
lily
and
she
smiled
at
the
silent
lily
who
stood
in
one
corner
of
the
kitchen
with
her
eyes
fixed
wonderingly
upon
her
new
friends
chapter
vii
a
surprise
when
the
third
day
passed
without
mollie
appearing
at
the
arnolds
cabin
arnold
gave
berry
permission
to
go
and
find
out
the
reason
there
were
not
to
be
any
lessons
that
morning
as
arnold
had
not
been
well
for
several
days
and
it
was
lily
who
cared
for
the
cow
brought
the
milk
to
the
cabin
the
wood
from
the
shed
and
did
all
the
chores
that
berry
s
father
usually
did
about
the
cabin
isn
t
it
lucky
i
found
lily
berry
asked
soberly
as
she
made
ready
for
her
tramp
over
the
ridge
to
the
braggs
cabin
lily
is
a
great
help
arnold
replied
but
she
did
not
tell
berry
that
the
fact
of
having
the
fugitive
slave
girl
in
the
house
might
prove
a
great
danger
to
the
yankee
household
on
the
tennessee
mountain
ridge
do
not
say
a
word
about
lily
to
mollie
or
to
and
bragg
arnold
added
and
berry
promised
thinking
that
whatever
mollie
s
secret
was
it
could
not
be
more
wonderful
than
the
discovery
of
lily
it
s
like
spring
thought
berry
as
she
strode
along
the
path
i
smell
it
in
the
for
it
was
one
of
the
days
of
late
january
when
among
the
ravines
and
valleys
of
the
tennessee
mountains
spring
seems
close
at
hand
the
sun
shone
warmly
down
and
wrens
nuthatches
and
cardinals
flitted
about
the
forest
it
won
t
be
long
before
the
sap
begins
to
run
and
we
can
make
thought
berry
for
there
was
a
grove
of
sugar
maples
not
two
miles
distant
from
the
cabin
and
berry
recalled
the
previous
spring
when
she
and
her
father
had
tapped
the
trees
boiled
down
the
sap
and
made
and
that
s
what
we
ll
do
this
year
she
decided
happily
as
she
left
the
path
for
a
moment
to
watch
a
scurrying
partridge
as
it
fluttered
over
the
rough
ground
berry
had
not
gone
far
from
home
however
before
she
was
sure
that
she
was
being
followed
that
someone
keeping
well
out
of
sight
behind
trees
and
underbrush
was
not
far
behind
her
and
she
wondered
if
it
might
not
be
the
man
who
only
a
week
earlier
had
spoken
to
her
at
the
brook
crossing
and
mistaken
her
for
a
boy
and
at
this
thought
berry
s
hand
sought
the
silver
whistle
but
the
whistle
wouldn
t
help
father
is
too
ill
to
come
she
thought
but
it
might
frighten
anyone
who
was
hiding
she
decided
but
berry
did
not
use
the
whistle
she
was
a
fleet
runner
and
off
she
went
at
her
best
pace
sure
that
she
could
outrun
any
pursuer
nevertheless
by
the
breaking
of
twigs
and
the
crashing
noises
in
the
undergrowth
the
little
girl
knew
that
her
unseen
pursuer
still
kept
her
in
view
and
not
until
she
reached
the
highway
along
which
she
must
go
for
a
short
distance
before
reaching
the
rough
lane
leading
to
the
braggs
cabin
did
she
believe
that
she
was
at
last
out
of
reach
of
her
pursuer
i
ll
ask
bragg
to
go
home
with
me
berry
resolved
as
she
hurried
up
the
lane
for
she
recalled
the
stranger
s
threats
if
she
told
of
having
seen
him
and
did
not
wish
to
encounter
him
again
as
berry
came
in
sight
of
mollie
s
home
she
noticed
that
there
was
no
thread
of
smoke
rising
from
the
chimney
of
the
cabin
it
had
a
lonely
and
deserted
look
but
berry
did
not
stop
to
think
of
this
she
was
sure
that
in
a
moment
the
door
would
open
wide
and
mollie
smiling
with
pleasure
at
the
sight
of
her
friend
would
give
her
a
warm
welcome
berry
rapped
on
the
door
and
then
gave
it
a
little
push
but
the
door
did
not
open
there
was
no
response
to
her
knock
and
berry
now
noticed
that
the
cabin
windows
on
each
side
of
the
door
were
evidently
boarded
up
on
the
inside
they
ve
gone
away
and
mollie
did
not
tell
me
she
exclaimed
aloud
with
a
sense
of
angry
resentment
against
poor
mollie
that
was
her
old
secret
all
the
time
i
was
making
her
doll
and
her
dress
and
when
she
was
pretending
to
want
to
come
to
school
she
knew
she
was
going
off
thought
berry
tears
of
angry
resentment
and
disappointment
coming
to
her
eyes
it
was
to
be
many
weeks
before
berry
was
to
hear
the
true
story
of
the
braggs
sudden
disappearance
and
learn
that
poor
little
mollie
had
not
been
given
time
to
tell
her
great
secret
or
to
say
to
the
friends
who
had
given
her
such
a
happy
birthday
for
a
few
moments
berry
stood
on
the
worn
stone
that
formed
the
threshold
to
the
dilapidated
cabin
wondering
where
the
braggs
had
gone
and
if
they
meant
to
return
the
boarded
windows
made
her
feel
sure
that
they
had
no
intention
of
coming
back
and
with
a
mournful
sigh
berry
at
last
turned
from
the
cabin
and
started
on
her
tramp
back
through
the
forest
her
thoughts
were
so
filled
by
mollie
s
disappearance
that
she
had
entirely
forgotten
the
possibility
of
again
encountering
the
man
who
had
called
her
berry
nees
and
not
until
she
had
left
the
main
road
and
chanced
to
see
a
crouching
figure
lurking
behind
an
old
stump
near
the
path
did
she
realize
that
whoever
it
was
that
had
followed
her
from
home
was
still
watching
her
every
step
almost
without
thinking
berry
drew
the
silver
whistle
from
her
pocket
and
its
sharp
call
sounded
clearly
through
the
silence
of
the
woodland
path
and
came
echoing
back
as
if
repeated
by
a
dozen
whistles
and
instantly
the
crouching
figure
sprang
upright
and
leaped
toward
the
little
girl
exclaiming
don
missie
fer
de
lawd
sakes
don
blow
no
whissel
and
berry
found
herself
clasped
tightly
by
the
thin
arms
of
lily
who
whispered
fearfully
yo
don
know
w
at
a
whissel
might
fotch
missie
deed
yo
don
and
her
big
frightened
eyes
stared
at
berry
as
if
they
were
both
facing
some
great
peril
berry
pulled
herself
angrily
away
from
the
girl
s
clutching
fingers
was
it
you
who
followed
me
all
the
way
from
home
she
demanded
yas
missie
came
the
faltering
response
and
you
were
hiding
behind
that
stump
to
follow
me
home
i
suppose
she
continued
yas
missie
replied
lily
in
a
whisper
berry
was
now
feeling
herself
a
much
abused
person
to
have
mollie
her
only
friend
and
playmate
disappear
without
a
word
of
explanation
or
had
been
a
bitter
experience
to
have
felt
herself
pursued
all
along
the
forest
trail
by
a
possible
enemy
and
now
to
discover
that
she
had
been
needlessly
afraid
because
of
this
stupid
negro
girl
made
her
angry
and
resentful
berry
did
not
stop
to
ask
why
lily
had
followed
her
or
to
remember
that
the
girl
was
still
afraid
of
every
sound
and
felt
herself
safe
only
when
near
to
the
little
girl
who
had
befriended
her
and
angry
words
rushed
to
her
lips
don
t
you
dare
follow
me
another
step
i
don
t
want
to
see
you
again
ever
she
declared
and
without
another
glance
at
the
cowering
figure
berry
hurried
on
up
the
trail
she
no
longer
noticed
the
calls
of
the
forest
birds
or
the
sunshine
that
sent
flickering
shadows
across
the
woodland
path
mollie
was
gone
she
was
sure
she
would
never
see
her
again
and
that
stupid
negro
girl
had
made
her
run
all
that
distance
down
the
ridge
as
if
pursued
by
a
mountain
lion
she
thought
resentfully
i
wish
francis
was
home
she
half
sobbed
as
she
drew
near
the
cabin
everything
was
all
right
when
he
was
here
i
hate
war
for
berry
realized
that
it
was
the
war
that
had
taken
her
brother
from
home
to
unknown
perils
and
to
certain
danger
and
left
her
alone
with
her
mother
and
father
in
the
cabin
remote
from
friends
she
ran
into
the
kitchen
and
almost
ready
to
cry
exclaimed
mother
mother
mollie
s
gone
the
braggs
are
all
gone
and
the
cabin
fastened
up
and
mollie
never
let
us
know
perhaps
mollie
did
not
have
a
chance
my
dear
said
arnold
quietly
i
am
sure
she
would
have
told
us
if
she
could
but
the
braggs
are
not
the
only
ones
who
have
disappeared
lily
has
run
away
from
us
she
disappeared
just
after
you
left
the
cabin
i
don
t
understand
her
going
for
she
seemed
to
think
herself
safe
with
berry
stood
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
said
slowly
lily
will
come
back
of
course
she
i
hope
she
will
she
was
a
great
help
if
your
father
has
to
stay
indoors
for
a
time
i
do
not
know
how
we
will
manage
without
her
help
rejoined
arnold
berry
stepped
back
to
the
porch
and
looked
anxiously
down
the
path
but
there
was
no
sign
of
lily
come
in
dear
it
is
no
use
to
look
for
her
something
must
have
frightened
her
and
so
she
has
started
off
or
else
she
is
dishonest
and
ungrateful
said
arnold
when
berry
told
her
father
of
the
disappearance
of
the
entire
bragg
family
he
declared
that
he
was
not
surprised
very
likely
steve
bragg
has
heard
that
commodore
foote
s
gunboats
are
ready
to
come
up
the
tennessee
and
that
general
grant
is
preparing
to
advance
upon
the
river
forts
or
that
the
confederate
forces
may
move
toward
corinth
for
bragg
is
as
much
afraid
of
one
army
as
of
the
other
and
he
has
probably
taken
his
family
to
some
place
farther
from
the
river
and
from
the
road
to
corinth
he
said
adding
poor
little
mollie
her
one
day
at
school
is
likely
to
be
her
perhaps
they
will
come
back
berry
suggested
wishing
she
had
not
been
so
quick
to
blame
mollie
for
what
it
was
plainly
evident
the
little
girl
could
not
help
i
do
not
think
so
said
arnold
but
what
do
you
suppose
has
become
of
your
black
lily
and
her
father
s
eyes
rested
questioningly
on
the
sober
face
of
his
little
daughter
berry
made
no
reply
she
was
beginning
to
be
ashamed
of
her
anger
toward
lily
and
to
be
sorry
for
her
hasty
words
chapter
viii
lily
s
story
arnold
had
been
right
in
thinking
that
steve
bragg
had
removed
to
a
location
that
he
believed
safer
than
the
neighborhood
of
the
tennessee
river
in
the
late
winter
of
and
it
was
a
long
time
before
the
arnolds
had
any
news
of
their
former
neighbors
but
in
her
anxiety
about
lily
berry
forgot
for
the
moment
that
her
playmate
mollie
would
not
be
on
hand
for
their
walks
and
games
and
that
henceforth
she
would
be
the
only
little
girl
on
shiloh
ridge
noonday
passed
and
the
winter
afternoon
drew
to
a
close
and
berry
now
became
sure
that
they
would
never
see
lily
again
she
thought
of
the
friendless
negro
girl
again
wandering
about
without
food
or
shelter
and
trembling
at
every
noise
and
earnestly
wished
she
had
not
driven
her
away
just
at
nightfall
the
outer
door
was
cautiously
pushed
open
and
lily
her
arms
filled
with
wood
appeared
on
the
threshold
without
a
word
or
a
look
toward
the
astonished
arnold
and
the
surprised
berry
she
quietly
filled
the
and
taking
the
from
its
accustomed
place
started
toward
the
door
before
she
could
reach
it
berry
called
lily
and
started
toward
her
i
knows
yo
don
wan
me
h
ar
missie
an
soon
s
i
do
de
chores
fer
yo
ma
i
ll
get
my
ole
dress
an
go
the
girl
said
humbly
not
raising
her
eyes
to
look
at
the
little
girl
who
had
promised
to
be
her
friend
and
who
had
then
ordered
her
never
to
return
to
the
cabin
berry
does
not
want
you
to
go
lily
whatever
made
you
think
that
questioned
arnold
we
have
all
been
troubled
and
anxious
about
at
the
sound
of
arnold
s
friendly
voice
lily
looked
up
and
her
eyes
sought
berry
s
questioningly
don
t
go
away
lily
exclaimed
the
little
girl
i
don
t
want
you
to
a
broad
smile
crept
over
lily
s
face
as
she
glanced
from
berry
to
arnold
den
i
ain
ever
gwine
away
she
declared
and
started
off
with
the
milk
pail
toward
the
barn
lily
seemed
to
think
you
did
not
want
her
here
poor
girl
i
wonder
what
will
become
of
her
said
arnold
thoughtfully
oh
mother
you
talk
as
if
you
did
not
mean
for
her
to
stay
here
berry
reproachfully
responded
and
i
told
her
to
go
and
never
come
back
she
added
quickly
and
then
berry
told
the
story
of
lily
following
her
to
the
highway
she
kept
out
of
sight
all
the
way
mother
but
so
near
that
i
could
hear
her
in
the
underbrush
and
then
after
i
found
the
braggs
were
gone
and
started
for
home
and
heard
someone
ready
to
follow
me
again
and
found
it
was
lily
she
acted
so
foolish
and
frightened
i
told
her
i
never
wanted
to
see
her
arnold
busied
herself
with
some
work
at
the
kitchen
table
and
for
a
moment
made
no
response
it
was
berry
who
was
the
first
to
speak
of
course
i
did
not
mean
it
mother
i
want
her
to
stay
i
was
only
i
expect
lily
is
used
to
people
being
angry
with
her
perhaps
that
is
why
she
ran
away
it
may
be
the
reason
that
she
would
rather
suffer
cold
and
hunger
and
flee
in
terror
from
every
noise
rather
than
live
with
people
who
were
easily
angered
arnold
responded
quietly
angry
people
are
usually
cruel
people
she
added
and
before
berry
could
speak
her
mother
continued
the
only
reason
that
troubles
me
in
regard
to
lily
staying
with
us
is
that
your
father
and
i
might
be
accused
of
sheltering
a
runaway
slave
and
if
she
is
found
in
our
house
it
might
involve
us
in
serious
trouble
you
know
berry
this
is
a
slaveholding
but
no
one
knows
she
is
here
and
if
anyone
comes
they
will
think
lily
belongs
to
us
berry
responded
eagerly
and
mother
she
added
soberly
i
did
not
mean
to
be
angry
i
just
couldn
t
help
arnold
shook
her
head
that
s
what
everyone
thinks
my
dear
but
even
if
you
were
angry
it
was
no
excuse
lily
followed
you
because
she
loved
you
if
any
accident
had
befallen
you
on
the
way
lily
would
have
been
close
at
hand
to
help
or
protect
you
i
am
sure
that
was
her
reason
for
following
you
you
see
berry
you
were
the
first
one
to
help
lily
and
she
trusted
oh
dear
sniffed
berry
ready
to
cry
as
she
remembered
that
lily
had
not
tasted
food
since
early
morning
and
had
believed
herself
deserted
by
her
new
friend
and
she
came
back
to
do
your
chores
she
whimpered
i
ll
make
it
up
to
her
so
she
will
know
i
didn
t
mean
it
the
little
girl
declared
and
when
lily
brought
in
the
milk
it
was
berry
who
ran
to
meet
her
and
declared
oh
lily
we
couldn
t
manage
without
you
smiling
up
at
the
negro
girl
who
beamed
with
happiness
at
the
unexpected
kindness
i
jes
follered
yo
missie
cos
i
was
feared
fer
yo
she
whispered
i
didn
mean
no
harm
berry
nodded
she
did
not
want
lily
to
see
her
cry
and
so
she
ran
off
to
the
to
tell
her
father
the
good
news
of
lily
s
return
as
the
days
passed
and
no
one
appeared
in
pursuit
of
a
runaway
negro
girl
the
little
household
in
the
hillside
cabin
became
sure
that
at
least
for
a
time
lily
was
safe
and
arnold
came
to
feel
that
berry
might
be
right
in
thinking
that
chance
visitors
to
the
cabin
would
believe
lily
belonged
there
and
as
a
week
went
by
before
arnold
could
venture
very
far
from
the
cabin
lily
became
berry
s
companion
when
the
little
girl
journeyed
down
to
the
on
the
corinth
road
and
in
her
walks
along
the
mountain
paths
and
as
the
two
girls
wandered
about
together
lily
told
her
new
friend
something
of
her
pitiful
story
i
reckons
i
had
a
mammy
sometime
but
i
don
member

and
the
negro
girl

on

face
of

mistress

nodded

declared
solemnly

said
lily
with
a
delighted
chuckle
as
if
she
felt
that
her
wrongs
would
be
punished
by
the
freedom
of
her
berry
looked
at
her
in
astonishment

she
asked

and
lily
again
chuckled
as
if
comforted
by
the
possibility
that
her
would
soon
be
obliged
to
look
after
themselves
as
soon
as
they
reached
home
berry
repeated
the
story
of
lily
s
escape
from
the
alabama
plantation
she
hid
in
swamps
and
crept
into
barns
to
sleep
and
ate
corn
and
frozen
apples
and
eggs
and
it
wasn
t
her
master
she
ran
away
from
said
berry
and
then
told
her
mother
what
lily
had
said
then
we
can
feel
safe
about
her
not
being
followed
or
a
reward
offered
for
news
of
her
said
arnold
with
evident
relief
very
likely
her
master
does
not
even
know
that
she
has
run
and
the
little
household
was
no
longer
troubled
by
anxious
fears
lest
their
kindness
to
the
wandering
slave
girl
might
involve
them
in
trouble
and
arnold
felt
that
berry
was
much
safer
in
her
wanderings
about
the
ravine
with
lily
for
her
companion
and
berry
soon
discovered
that
the
slave
girl
knew
many
interesting
things
about
the
little
creatures
of
the
forest
it
was
lily
who
discovered
the
partridge
eggs
behind
a
fallen
log
not
far
from
the
cabin
and
cautioned
berry
not
to
go
near
them
or
the
partridge
might
desert
the
eggs
jes
keep
way
from
dar
missie
an
fus
t
ing
dar
ll
be
a
flock
of
little
partridges
she
said
and
it
was
lily
who
heard
the
first
call
of
the
wild
geese
flying
north
one
morning
in
early
february
it
was
lily
who
tamed
the
two
tiny
woodland
mice
that
peered
out
from
under
an
old
stump
one
sunny
morning
when
berry
and
lily
were
resting
near
by
the
negro
girl
cautioned
berry
to
be
quiet
and
attracted
the
tiny
creatures
with
little
calls
until
they
stopped
and
fixed
their
bright
eyes
upon
her
and
even
ventured
near
enough
to
eat
bits
of
bread
from
the
girls
luncheon
for
several
days
berry
and
lily
made
daily
trips
to
the
old
log
with
food
for
their
new
friends
whom
they
named
dot
and
dash
and
the
mice
apparently
were
always
on
the
watch
for
them
when
arnold
was
again
able
to
take
his
usual
walks
there
were
many
hints
of
spring
along
the
slopes
of
the
ravine
and
on
one
of
his
visits
to
the
highway
a
traveler
told
him
that
the
forts
on
the
cumberland
and
tennessee
rivers
had
been
captured
on
february
by
general
grant
assisted
by
the
fleet
of
gunboats
commanded
by
commodore
foote
fort
donelson
had
been
taken
and
general
buell
was
preparing
to
advance
against
the
confederate
army
at
nashville
this
was
a
great
success
for
northern
forces
and
the
arnolds
earnestly
hoped
might
help
to
bring
the
war
to
an
end
but
arnold
realized
that
it
must
bring
the
troops
of
both
the
confederate
and
the
union
armies
further
south
and
who
could
tell
how
near
the
little
mountain
cabin
might
stand
to
some
future
battlefield
but
he
did
not
mention
this
anxiety
to
berry
but
cautioned
her
not
to
go
to
the
road
leading
to
corinth
and
berry
was
now
counting
the
days
when
the
could
be
tapped
and
begin
when
another
adventure
befell
her
that
might
well
have
proven
a
dangerous
one
had
it
not
been
for
lily
s
courage
and
faithfulness
chapter
ix
the
witch
s
tree
mother
can
t
lily
wear
those
old
clothes
of
francis
s
berry
asked
one
march
day
when
lily
had
returned
from
a
scramble
up
the
ridge
with
the
old
dress
of
arnold
s
that
she
had
worn
since
coming
to
the
cabin
so
badly
torn
by
the
thorns
and
underbrush
that
it
was
no
longer
fit
to
wear
she
can
t
climb
trees
or
run
as
fast
as
i
do
or
anything
in
that
long
skirt
complained
berry
and
added
quickly
and
she
would
like
to
wear
things
like
yas
m
lily
agreed
hopefully
looking
admiringly
at
her
little
mistress
why
did
i
not
think
of
it
before
exclaimed
arnold
who
had
been
puzzled
to
know
how
to
obtain
clothing
for
the
negro
girl
with
northern
armies
advancing
into
tennessee
and
with
general
johnston
at
the
head
of
the
southern
forces
at
nashville
the
family
in
the
mountain
cabin
would
have
no
opportunity
to
procure
clothing
arnold
realized
that
it
might
be
months
before
it
would
be
safe
to
venture
to
any
of
the
neighboring
towns
and
that
they
must
take
every
possible
care
of
their
supplies
therefore
berry
s
suggestion
that
lily
should
wear
the
outgrown
garments
of
francis
seemed
to
solve
a
difficult
problem
and
arnold
closely
followed
by
berry
and
lily
hastened
to
open
the
old
trunk
in
the
small
chamber
where
lily
slept
where
francis
s
clothing
was
packed
here
are
some
very
good
shoes
said
arnold
as
she
took
out
a
pair
of
stout
leather
shoes
try
them
on
the
negro
girl
promptly
obeyed
and
they
proved
a
fairly
good
fit
then
arnold
drew
forth
the
brown
corduroy
knickerbockers
and
the
patched
flannel
blouse
which
her
boy
who
was
now
so
far
away
with
the
army
of
the
potomac
in
virginia
had
worn
in
the
early
days
of
their
stay
in
the
mountain
cabin
lily
was
soon
dressed
in
these
comfortable
garments
and
berry
jumped
about
in
delight
as
she
exclaimed
now
lily
we
ll
see
who
can
run
the
faster
and
if
i
win
you
can
t
say
it
is
because
you
wear
long
dat
s
de
truf
missie
berry
but
i
reckons
yo
ll
win
anyways
responded
lily
her
solemn
eyes
fixed
admiringly
on
berry
that
afternoon
berry
raked
the
leaves
from
her
garden
bed
and
began
to
make
plans
for
the
border
of
wild
flowers
that
she
would
transplant
from
the
slopes
of
the
ravine
or
from
sheltered
places
in
the
wood
on
the
previous
day
she
and
lily
had
discovered
the
butterwort
in
bloom
near
the
wide
brook
where
she
had
encountered
the
threatening
stranger
its
pale
yellow
flowers
nodding
from
their
slender
stems
above
its
flat
rosette
of
curious
leaves
it
was
one
of
the
earliest
blooms
of
the
year
in
that
part
of
tennessee
and
berry
was
eager
to
bring
home
enough
of
the
plants
to
brighten
her
garden
border
as
she
knew
the
butterwort
would
continue
to
blossom
through
march
and
early
in
the
afternoon
with
lily
as
her
companion
she
started
off
toward
the
brook
lily
carried
the
large
basket
in
which
they
planned
to
bring
the
plants
home
there
were
many
hints
that
spring
was
close
at
hand
robins
and
cardinals
flitted
about
among
the
squirrels
scolded
and
chattered
and
little
now
and
then
scampered
out
from
shelter
as
the
girls
came
out
from
the
forest
berry
stopped
suddenly
and
looked
about
in
delight
the
is
in
blossom
she
exclaimed
for
the
tall
slender
growing
along
the
borders
of
the
forest
and
standing
in
small
clumps
in
the
open
clearing
had
put
forth
their
crimson
buds
and
blossoms
brightening
the
leafless
branches
and
making
the
woods
glow
with
color

shook
her
head
as

feeling
it
was
hardly
safe
to
speak
of
such
dangerous
subjects
do
you
really
believe

she
added
i

said
berry
thoughtfully
and
if
they
were
good
witches
perhaps
they
would
tell

she
added
thoughtfully
berry
was
now
eager
to
know
all
that
lily
could
tell
her
and
forgetting
all
about
the
butterwort
the
two
girls
seated
themselves
on
a
log
near
the
trees
and
lily
began
the
story
she
had
so
often
heard
on
the
alabama
plantation
of
the
proper
way
to
secure
the
friendly
assistance
of
a
witch
course

and
lily
nodded
her
woolly
head
so
solemnly
that
berry
was
convinced
that
her
companion
could
tell
her
exactly
the
right
manner
to
win
the
friendship
of
these
powerful
creatures
who
met
at
midnight
beneath
the

and
lily
cast
a
troubled
glance
at
her
young
mistress
of
course
you
must
tell
me
lily
berry
insisted
eagerly
just
telling
me
what
people
do
to
get
a
promise
from
a
witch
can
t
do
me
any
harm
and
sometime
it
might
be
a
great
help
she
urged
dat
s
so
missie
lily
agreed
thoughtfully
and
with
a
cautious
look
toward
the
flaming
as
if
even
in
daylight
some
careless
witch
might
forget
herself
and
appear
at
the
chosen
of
her
kind
the
negro
girl
drew
a
long
breath
and
leaning
nearer
to
berry
began
in
almost
a
whisper
to
tell
the
proper
way
to
gain
the
favor
of
witches

berry
drew
a
long
breath
as
lily
finished
the
little
girl
was
quite
ready
to
believe
that
this
negro
girl
really
was
sure
in
regard
to
the
witches
and
their
power
if
i
can
find
out
about
mollie
and
perhaps
send
her
a
message
it
will
be
splendid
thought
berry
and
then
made
the
decision
to
try
and
win
the
favor
of
the
witches
who
made
the
their
but
she
said
nothing
to
lily
of
this
resolve
and
as
the
negro
girl
took
up
the
basket
and
they
made
their
way
to
the
borders
of
the
stream
where
the
butterwort
was
in
blossom
neither
of
the
girls
even
imagined
that
close
to
the
log
where
they
sat
a
man
had
been
hiding
behind
the
underbrush
a
tall
man
whose
face
was
nearly
covered
by
a
brown
beard
he
wore
a
round
cap
of
coonskin
a
leather
jacket
stout
corduroy
breeches
and
high
boots
a
hunter
s
belt
held
a
revolver
and
a
and
if
berry
could
have
had
even
a
glimpse
of
this
skulking
figure
she
would
have
at
once
recognized
him
as
the
threatening
stranger
whom
she
had
encountered
near
this
very
spot
nearly
two
months
earlier
the
man
chuckled
to
himself
as
he
watched
the
girls
go
down
the
little
slope
to
the
stream
berry
has
a
nigger
boy
with
him
nowadays
eh
he
reflected
that
may
be
a
help
later
on
for
that
white
boy
means
to
find
out
more
about
witches
well
i
ll
send
him
over
the
road
to
corinth
at
a
good
pace
or
know
why
when
the
time
comes
he
concluded
and
slunk
away
in
the
forest
the
man
was
a
spy
in
the
employ
of
the
confederate
army
and
was
now
traveling
back
along
their
line
of
defense
carrying
messages
from
general
breckinridge
commander
of
the
confederate
reserves
who
only
a
little
more
than
a
year
earlier
had
been
of
the
united
states
to
general
beauregard
whose
plan
to
concentrate
the
confederate
army
of
the
mississippi
at
corinth
was
to
bring
about
one
of
the
greatest
battles
of
the
civil
war
the
battle
of
shiloh
the
name
of
this
man
was
orson
he
realized
that
the
time
was
close
at
hand
when
a
messenger
might
be
of
the
utmost
importance
and
in
berry
nees
he
believed
he
had
discovered
such
a
messenger
orson
was
still
sure
berry
was
a
lad
from
some
remote
cabin
and
meant
very
soon
to
make
berry
prove
the
boast
of
being
a
fleet
runner
chapter
x
berry
in
danger
lily
was
interested
in
all
the
tiny
wild
creatures
who
lived
along
the
mountain
slopes
or
made
their
homes
near
the
creeks
she
had
queer
names
for
many
of
these

the

lily
would
conclude
soberly
and
as
the
two
girls
wandered
about
the
mountain
trails
lily
s
keen
eyes
were
always
searching
path
and
thicket
for
a
sight
of
some
nest
or
the
of
tiny
woodland
creatures
of
each
one
of
these
she
would
have
some
story
to
tell
either
of
the
way
the
birds
built
their
nests
or
of
how
weasels
would
spring
from
unseen
coverts
upon
rabbits
or
squirrels
lily
had
made
a
rough
bag
of
a
piece
of
cloth
that
she
had
begged
from
arnold
and
berry
noticed
that
the
negro
girl
was
always
on
the
alert
to
discover
and
secure
any
feather
that
might
drift
across
their
path
or
that
had
lodged
on
some
wayside
bush
lily
had
fastened
this
bag
to
her
belt
and
not
a
day
passed
that
some
downy
feather
was
not
secured
and
safely
put
away
sometimes
she
would
be
fortunate
enough
to
discover
a
tiny
red
feather
of
the
scarlet
tanager
or
perhaps
a
quill
from
the
blue
jay
and
on
these
fortunate
occasions
she
would
rejoice
triumphantly
dat
shure
am
fine
she
would
exclaim
with
chuckles
of
delight
what
do
you
want
with
all
those
feathers
lily
berry
would
ask
but
lily
would
only
nod
and
say
jes
yo
wait
missie
berry
some
day
yo
s
gwine
ter
be
s
prised
and
after
a
while
berry
ceased
to
question
her
believing
that
the
gathering
of
these
tiny
feathers
was
only
another
of
lily
s
peculiar
ways
beside
securing
birds
feathers
lily
was
always
searching
for
the
strong
pliant
grasses
that
grew
near
the
creeks
she
would
cut
these
grasses
close
to
the
ground
with
the
greatest
care
and
tie
them
together
one
day
as
the
two
girls
climbed
the
slope
toward
shiloh
church
lily
suddenly
exclaimed
dar
i
b
en
fer
cedar
and
har
it
be
and
she
left
the
trail
and
began
to
tug
at
the
small
trailing
roots
of
a
cedar
tree
with
the
small
knife
that
lily
always
carried
she
cut
and
dug
up
portions
of
these
roots
and
then
scraped
off
the
soft
bark
nodding
and
smiling
her
satisfaction
berry
s
mind
was
entirely
filled
with
possible
plans
for
visiting
the
blossoming
trees
at
midnight
and
with
securing
the
necessary
gifts
by
which
the
witches
were
to
be
made
friendly
and
willing
to
answer
her
questions
in
regard
to
mollie
bragg
a
fine
cake
was
not
an
easy
thing
to
secure
the
arnolds
store
of
sugar
was
now
very
small
and
berry
remembered
that
in
order
to
make
the
birthday
cake
for
mollie
her
mother
had
said
they
must
henceforth
be
careful
in
their
use
of
sugar
beside
that
berry
could
not
offer
a
good
reason
in
asking
her
mother
to
make
a
cake
there
was
however
no
lack
of
honey
in
the
mountain
cabin
for
in
the
early
autumn
arnold
had
the
good
fortune
to
discover
a
a
partly
hollow
tree
where
wild
bees
had
stored
up
honey
and
berry
remembered
with
satisfaction
that
her
mother
had
declared
it
to
be
of
the
finest
quality
the
little
girl
knew
she
could
easily
secure
enough
of
this
store
of
honey
to
satisfy
any
witch
but
lily
had
declared
that
witches
were
not
easily
influenced
to
friendly
deeds
and
berry
felt
that
the
cake
must
in
some
way
be
obtained
and
as
soon
as
possible
for
with
the
approach
of
spring
berry
missed
mollie
more
and
more
and
was
eager
to
try
any
plan
by
which
she
might
get
news
of
her
absent
playmate
at
the
beginning
of
march
the
week
after
berry
first
heard
of
the
possibility
of
securing
the
of
midnight
witches
arnold
received
news
that
general
buell
in
command
of
union
forces
in
east
tennessee
had
captured
nashville
the
capital
of
tennessee
and
that
general
johnston
and
the
confederate
troops
had
moved
southward
to
murfreesboro
thus
while
the
confederates
had
won
all
the
earlier
battles
of
the
conflict
along
the
eastern
line
of
defense
the
capture
of
fort
henry
and
fort
donelson
and
the
taking
of
nashville
had
restored
the
confidence
of
the
north
and
created
vague
terrors
in
the
south
berry
heard
her
father
and
mother
discuss
these
happenings
and
her
father
even
declared
that
if
general
johnston
with
his
army
of
men
should
join
general
beauregard
at
corinth
there
would
be
confederate
troops
ready
to
meet
general
grant
s
army
if
he
moved
against
such
a
stronghold
where
would
grant
s
army
come
from
berry
asked
eagerly
would
it
march
up
the
road
from
pittsburg
landing
oh
i
could
see
it
march
from
the
big
oak
tree
that
hangs
over
the
ravine
she
exclaimed
eagerly
very
likely
grant
s
soldiers
may
be
landed
at
pittsburg
and
march
over
the
ravine
road
arnold
responded
thoughtfully
but
if
they
do
we
may
not
know
anything
about
it
armies
do
not
advertise
the
time
of
their
arrival
my
dear
and
for
my
part
i
hope
general
grant
will
choose
another
approach
to
corinth
but
you
must
promise
me
berry
not
to
go
near
the
ravine
road
even
now
the
confederates
may
be
on
guard
at
pittsburg
landing
and
we
must
all
do
our
best
to
keep
near
the
cabin
until
we
really
know
what
grant
will
berry
promised
a
little
reluctantly
pittsburg
landing
was
so
far
from
the
hillside
cabin
that
berry
thought
the
road
from
there
to
corinth
that
led
through
a
ravine
not
far
distant
would
be
safe
enough
even
with
soldiers
at
each
end
of
it
and
if
armies
by
any
chance
should
march
that
way
berry
felt
it
a
great
pity
to
miss
so
wonderful
a
sight
for
she
was
too
young
to
realize
all
the
terror
and
suffering
brought
by
war
and
she
had
not
the
faintest
idea
how
soon
she
was
to
be
almost
in
the
centre
of
one
of
the
most
terrific
battles
of
the
civil
war
up
to
the
spring
of
the
battle
of
shiloh
when
her
father
spoke
of
general
grant
s
probable
advance
against
johnston
s
army
berry
s
thoughts
were
chiefly
occupied
with
plans
for
a
midnight
visit
to
the
and
she
did
not
really
believe
it
possible
that
troops
might
soon
be
on
the
march
along
those
quiet
roads
near
her
home
it
was
now
early
march
arnold
and
lily
were
busy
with
making
a
supply
of
soap
setting
a
barrel
with
ashes
over
which
water
was
turned
and
which
was
called
the
to
drip
into
a
big
iron
kettle
then
the
scraps
of
fat
that
had
been
carefully
saved
for
months
were
boiled
down
over
a
fire
in
the
yard
and
strained
the
lye
from
the
was
added
and
again
boiled
and
a
good
supply
of
soft
soap
was
the
result
these
yard
fires
had
to
be
carefully
watched
and
tended
the
soft
soap
in
its
last
process
of
boiling
had
to
be
frequently
stirred
and
berry
and
lily
spent
the
greater
part
of
several
days
in
the
yard
tending
fires
and
kettles
beside
there
were
other
springtime
affairs
that
required
attention
it
was
time
to
tap
the
in
the
little
grove
on
a
distant
hillside
and
arnold
had
begun
to
spade
the
plot
used
for
a
vegetable
garden
so
that
every
member
of
the
little
household
was
busy
and
until
the
day
set
for
the
visit
to
the
maple
grove
berry
and
lily
did
not
go
outside
the
space
about
the
cabin
the
day
set
for
the
visit
to
the
maples
was
clear
and
sunny
and
it
was
decided
that
the
entire
family
should
go
have
a
picnic
dinner
and
spend
the
greater
part
of
the
day
on
the
hillside
we
will
find
arbutus
in
bloom
said
arnold
as
they
started
out
berry
and
lily
leading
the
way
along
the
woodland
paths
berry
had
now
discarded
the
leather
boots
that
she
had
worn
during
the
winter
months
and
wore
moccasins
that
arnold
had
made
for
her
and
as
she
went
rapidly
along
the
trail
she
made
no
more
noise
than
a
woodland
squirrel
berry
and
her
father
tapped
the
maples
this
was
done
by
making
a
small
incision
into
the
trunk
of
the
tree
about
two
feet
above
the
ground
inserting
a
tiny
spout
and
setting
a
pail
under
it
to
hold
the
sap
the
next
morning
arnold
would
come
and
gather
the
sap
turn
it
into
a
large
kettle
and
boil
it
down
to
a
syrup
while
berry
and
her
father
went
from
tree
to
tree
arnold
and
lily
searched
the
hillside
for
the
arbutus
blossoms
and
carefully
placed
damp
moss
about
the
blooms
they
gathered
to
keep
them
fresh
arnold
was
busy
with
his
work
and
did
not
notice
when
berry
wandered
farther
up
the
hillside
and
when
he
had
finished
setting
the
pails
and
the
little
girl
was
not
to
be
seen
he
supposed
she
was
with
her
mother
and
lily
searching
for
arbutus
and
looked
about
for
a
suitable
place
to
start
a
fire
over
which
to
boil
the
coffee
and
cook
the
bacon
and
potatoes
for
their
dinner
when
this
was
well
under
way
he
opened
the
basket
containing
the
food
and
decided
to
surprise
arnold
by
having
the
meal
all
ready
before
calling
her
and
it
was
nearly
an
hour
later
when
his
familiar
whistle
brought
arnold
closely
followed
by
lily
scrambling
up
the
hillside
each
carrying
a
basket
of
twisted
spruce
and
fir
branches
well
filled
with
moss
and
the
delicate
fragrant
arbutus
blossoms
it
is
like
a
may
day
arnold
declared
smilingly
and
how
good
that
bacon
smells
frederic
i
never
was
so
hungry
and
seating
herself
a
short
distance
from
the
glowing
bed
of
coals
over
which
the
bacon
was
cheerfully
sizzling
arnold
looked
about
for
her
little
daughter
thinking
berry
was
close
at
hand
arnold
refused
any
assistance
declaring
no
one
could
broil
bacon
over
a
wood
fire
as
perfectly
as
he
could
do
it
and
not
until
arnold
had
been
served
with
a
potato
bacon
and
a
plate
of
biscuit
from
the
lunch
basket
set
beside
her
did
berry
s
father
and
mother
look
about
for
her
and
then
discovered
that
lily
had
also
disappeared
berry
can
t
be
as
hungry
as
i
am
or
she
would
be
on
hand
said
arnold
as
the
sound
of
arnold
s
whistle
echoed
along
the
hillside
hunting
for
flowers
but
she
ll
soon
be
here
with
lily
at
her
heels
responded
arnold
and
added
i
wonder
if
we
shall
ever
see
little
mollie
bragg
again
i
am
sure
we
will
arnold
replied
poor
child
i
am
glad
she
was
not
taken
away
before
we
could
give
her
a
happy
birthday
to
remember
and
talking
of
the
braggs
the
time
sped
by
and
yet
no
sign
or
sound
of
berry
or
lily
but
neither
nor
arnold
felt
anxious
as
to
the
girls
safety
berry
had
her
whistle
which
she
would
surely
sound
if
in
any
danger
and
with
lily
close
at
hand
it
did
not
seem
probable
that
any
accident
had
befallen
their
little
daughter
and
only
the
fact
that
the
potatoes
and
bacon
would
not
keep
hot
at
last
decided
arnold
to
repeat
his
call
and
finally
to
start
back
toward
the
maple
grove
in
search
of
berry
quite
sure
that
he
would
find
lily
with
her
berry
had
not
intended
to
go
out
of
sight
of
her
father
when
she
wandered
up
the
ridge
but
the
discovery
of
an
unexpected
trillium
in
blossom
led
her
to
go
further
on
hoping
to
find
more
and
by
the
time
her
father
had
started
his
fire
berry
was
on
the
further
slope
out
of
hearing
of
arnold
s
shrill
whistle
she
had
just
decided
to
turn
back
when
she
noticed
a
tiny
thread
of
smoke
creeping
up
behind
a
ledge
berry
knew
the
dangers
of
a
forest
fire
and
thinking
some
careless
woodsman
had
failed
to
put
out
his
fire
she
promptly
started
toward
the
smoke
meaning
to
put
out
the
fire
her
feet
made
no
noise
as
berry
climbed
over
the
ledge
as
she
looked
down
toward
the
thread
of
smoke
berry
nearly
lost
her
balance
for
just
below
not
twenty
feet
from
the
ledge
of
rocks
where
she
crouched
was
the
threatening
stranger
whom
she
had
met
at
the
brook
in
january
and
who
had
mistaken
her
for
a
boy
the
man
was
crouched
near
a
tiny
fire
over
which
he
was
roasting
a
partridge
if
he
had
not
been
so
intent
upon
his
cooking
he
might
have
become
conscious
that
someone
was
very
close
to
him
for
orson
was
a
thorough
woodsman
with
every
sense
on
the
alert
berry
looking
down
upon
him
realized
that
the
man
was
camping
there
as
a
rough
shelter
of
boughs
stood
near
by
she
resolved
to
slip
away
as
noiselessly
as
possible
with
her
eyes
still
fixed
on
the
crouching
figure
she
cautiously
moved
one
foot
and
then
the
other
backward
holding
to
the
rocks
with
both
hands
there
was
a
little
noiseless
movement
along
the
ledge
and
berry
felt
both
her
feet
held
a
loose
rock
started
by
her
movements
had
been
gradually
slipping
and
now
held
berry
a
prisoner
it
had
rolled
against
her
ankles
binding
her
to
the
side
of
the
ledge
what
can
i
do
she
wondered
to
sound
her
whistle
even
to
endeavor
to
push
the
rock
away
would
instantly
bring
the
man
leaping
up
the
ledge
i
must
get
clear
myself
some
way
she
resolved
but
she
could
think
of
no
way
to
free
herself
chapter
xi
the
midnight
adventure
lily
s
wanderings
during
her
flight
from
the
alabama
plantation
had
made
her
alert
and
watchful
of
every
woodland
noise
and
sign
since
berry
had
not
come
down
the
ridge
with
arnold
lily
was
sure
she
had
followed
a
wandering
path
leading
to
the
summit
and
the
negro
girl
sped
swiftly
along
at
first
she
thought
of
calling
her
young
mistress
s
name
but
her
instinct
for
silence
prevented
this
and
as
she
found
herself
facing
the
ledge
where
berry
was
held
prisoner
by
the
rock
that
had
slipped
against
her
ankles
lily
had
no
impulse
to
cry
out
as
quietly
as
berry
herself
she
crept
down
close
to
the
ledge
and
noticing
the
thread
of
smoke
a
dreadful
fear
took
possession
of
her
lak
as
not
it
s
fo
ks
fer
me
my
lan
w
ot
i
better
do
was
her
first
thought
then
her
eyes
turned
toward
the
girl
clinging
to
the
ledge
the
girl
who
had
been
the
first
to
speak
kindly
to
the
fugitive
slave
girl
and
instantly
lily
recalled
all
berry
s
kindness
had
meant
to
her
and
she
forgot
her
fears
for
her
own
safety
and
thought
only
of
her
young
mistress
illustration
without
a
word
berry
pointed
to
the
heavy
rock
she
be
fraid
ob
dat
man
down
dar
she
instantly
decided
as
peering
from
behind
a
sheltering
tree
she
discovered
orson
still
intent
on
his
roasting
bird
lily
crept
up
the
ledge
whispering
softly
missie
berry
and
berry
turned
her
head
to
find
lily
s
hand
near
her
shoulder
without
a
word
berry
pointed
to
the
heavy
rock
resting
against
her
ankles
and
then
toward
the
camp
beneath
the
ledge
and
shook
her
head
solemnly
and
lily
promptly
understood
that
berry
feared
to
be
discovered
lily
nodded
her
understanding
of
the
message
and
cautiously
worked
her
way
to
a
place
where
she
could
make
an
effort
to
release
berry
s
feet
pulling
with
all
her
strength
she
was
able
to
raise
the
heavy
stone
so
that
berry
could
draw
herself
free
from
its
hold
and
then
noiselessly
as
before
the
negro
girl
lowered
the
stone
gently
back
and
the
two
girls
crept
down
the
ledge
and
were
soon
safely
in
the
shelter
of
the
forest
neither
of
them
had
spoken
a
single
word
since
lily
s
whisper
when
she
reached
the
ledge
but
now
berry
turned
quickly
to
her
companion
and
said
gratefully
oh
lily
what
would
i
have
done
if
you
had
not
found
me
and
how
clever
you
were
to
come
so
quietly
that
s
the
man
who
threatened
me
near
the
brook
before
you
came
she
added
as
they
hurried
up
the
rough
slope
dat
man
af
er
me
lily
declared
solemnly
oh
missie
berry
don
let
him

togedder
missie
berry
at
railway
stations
to
be
tuk
and
lily
trembled
at
the
thought
of
being
discovered
at
that
moment
before
berry
could
reply
arnold
s
shrill
whistle
reached
their
ears
and
berry
instantly
responded
and
lily
had
only
time
to
say
don
say
a
wud
bout
dat
man

missie
berry
promise
she
pleaded
so
urgently
that
berry
agreed
but
i
know

lily
she
added
as
they
ran
forward
to
meet
arnold
oh
father
i
got
my
feet
caught
in
a
ledge
and
lily
helped
me
out
she
explained
hurriedly
and
we
re
both
arnold
had
contrived
to
keep
the
potatoes
hot
and
the
two
girls
made
an
excellent
lunch
while
berry
told
of
finding
the
trillium
blossom
and
of
climbing
a
ledge
and
a
rock
rolling
against
her
ankles
lily
came
just
in
time
and
moved
the
rock
so
gently
that
my
ankles
don
t
hurt
a
bit
said
berry
while
lily
listened
fearful
that
some
careless
word
might
betray
the
secret
but
arnold
hurried
them
all
toward
home
as
the
march
day
was
drawing
toward
sunset
and
on
the
way
berry
found
a
chance
to
tell
lily
that
the
man
they
had
seen
was
probably
a
confederate
spy
my
father
says
that
general
beauregard
has
a
confederate
army
at
corinth
and
probably
this
man
is
watching
to
see
if
general
grant
s
soldiers
are
coming
this
way
she
explained
to
the
frightened
negro
girl
and
her
explanation
was
the
right
one
orson
knew
that
numbers
of
confederate
soldiers
were
daily
arriving
from
mississippi
louisiana
and
alabama
in
regiments
squads
or
unarmed
and
singly
at
corinth
all
these
were
being
formed
into
the
confederate
army
of
the
mississippi
with
general
johnston
in
supreme
command
and
with
the
brave
and
accomplished
beauregard
as
second
supplies
for
this
army
reached
corinth
over
all
railroads
spies
were
bringing
daily
reports
of
the
progress
of
grant
s
army
and
of
general
buell
s
rapid
approach
from
columbia
and
orson
was
lurking
along
the
roads
from
pittsburg
landing
to
corinth
ready
to
carry
or
send
instant
news
of
any
approach
of
the
enemy
over
these
roads
but
lily
shook
her
head
over
berry
s
explanation
he
luk
jes
lak
de
men
dat
hunt

er
de
run
way
niggers
she
insisted
and
so
berry
again
agreed
not
to
tell
her
father
of
her
discovery
of
the
camping
spy
orson
knew
of
the
arnolds
cabin
but
kept
a
good
distance
from
it
although
he
believed
it
the
cabin
of
some
industrious
mountaineer
who
was
without
doubt
loyal
to
the
confederacy
he
had
seen
lily
and
berry
more
than
once
unseen
by
them
and
supposed
lily
to
be
a
negro
boy
owned
by
the
arnolds
he
meant
at
the
right
moment
to
send
berry
nees
speeding
over
the
road
to
corinth
with
news
for
general
beauregard
he
kept
a
nightly
watch
by
the
to
see
if
berry
had
brought
the
sweets
that
would
mean
a
midnight
visit
and
on
the
second
evening
after
the
arnolds
visit
to
the
maple
grove
his
watch
was
rewarded
for
close
against
the
trees
rested
a
number
of
small
packages
orson
had
no
scruples
in
examining
these
one
contained
a
glass
tumbler
filled
with
honey
over
which
the
spy
chuckled
thinking
it
would
be
an
acceptable
addition
to
his
somewhat
limited
food
supply
in
another
package
was
a
square
of
made
from
the
fresh
syrup
there
was
also
a
small
square
cake
sweetened
with
that
berry
had
persuaded
her
mother
to
make
for
her
that
morning
for
berry
had
noticed
that
the
were
beginning
to
fade
the
leaves
rapidly
covering
such
blossoms
as
remained
and
by
cautiously
questioning
lily
she
discovered
that
unless
the
tree
were
in
bloom
the
witches
were
not
apt
to
visit
them
and
she
realized
she
must
lose
no
time
in
asking
their
help
for
news
of
mollie
berry
found
no
trouble
in
carrying
her
gifts
to
the
near
the
stream
for
that
afternoon
lily
had
gone
with
arnold
to
bring
home
the
syrup
that
arnold
had
made
leaving
berry
alone
in
the
cabin
and
she
collected
her
supplies
and
hastened
off
to
leave
them
at
the
in
order
that
the
witches
might
not
fail
to
find
them
on
their
arrival
and
she
was
resolved
to
be
on
hand
when
the
witches
appeared
at
midnight
although
she
was
a
little
fearful
that
it
might
not
be
an
easy
matter
to
keep
awake
until
the
time
came
to
leave
the
cabin
or
to
creep
out
without
being
discovered
by
her
mother
or
father
nevertheless
she
was
resolved
to
make
the
attempt
for
it
seemed
to
berry
as
if
she
could
get
news
from
mollie
in
no
other
way
than
through
the
friendly
help
of
witches
who
were
new
possibilities
in
berry
s
experience
the
sky
clouded
over
before
arnold
and
lily
returned
and
by
sunset
a
strong
wind
was
sweeping
along
the
ridge
dis

and
she
rolled
her
eyes
solemnly
and
shook
her
head
berry
made
no
response
she
heard
the
wind
moaning
and
shrieking
as
the
big
branches
of
the
forest
trees
bent
before
it
and
began
to
dread
the
undertaking
that
was
before
her
she
was
so
quiet
in
the
early
evening
that
her
mother
was
sure
berry
must
be
more
tired
than
usual
and
suggested
that
the
little
girl
go
to
bed
lily
had
already
gone
to
her
room
and
arnold
declared
that
she
herself
was
too
sleepy
to
sit
up
and
at
an
unusually
early
hour
the
lights
in
the
little
cabin
were
extinguished
and
the
entire
household
excepting
berry
were
fast
asleep
in
her
own
room
still
fully
dressed
berry
sat
on
the
edge
of
her
bed
waiting
for
the
clock
to
strike
eleven
the
time
she
had
set
to
leave
the
cabin
more
than
once
she
dozed
off
to
wake
with
a
sudden
start
fearful
lest
she
had
overslept
but
when
the
clock
in
the
sounded
the
hour
of
eleven
berry
was
wide
awake
her
window
that
opened
outward
on
hinges
was
already
partly
open
and
berry
s
feet
made
no
noise
as
she
crossed
the
room
cautiously
swung
the
latticed
window
wide
open
and
fastened
it
back
and
then
reaching
out
grasped
the
strong
branch
of
the
big
oak
tree
that
grew
close
to
the
cabin
and
fearlessly
swung
herself
clear
of
the
berry
had
done
this
many
times
it
was
no
new
exploit
for
the
little
girl
to
scramble
along
the
stout
branch
and
down
the
trunk
of
the
oak
tree
to
a
secure
footing
on
the
slope
of
the
ravine
below
her
window
she
stood
silent
a
moment
looking
up
at
the
cabin
then
sure
that
no
one
had
heard
her
quiet
escape
she
crept
up
to
the
trail
and
was
off
toward
the
witches
tree
the
wind
swept
against
her
and
the
trees
of
the
forest
creaked
and
swayed
the
night
was
too
dark
even
for
shadows
and
berry
with
a
little
thrill
of
fear
recalled
lily
s
words
that
it
was
a
reg
lar
witch
s
as
she
neared
the
brook
she
saw
a
tiny
light
near
the
place
where
she
had
left
her
gifts
and
stopped
suddenly
then
remembering
that
lily
had
said
witches
usually
carried
tiny
lanterns
she
drew
a
long
breath
and
stepped
boldly
forward
bowing
very
low
according
to
lily
s
directions
and
putting
both
hands
over
her
eyes
for
lily
had
said
it
would
be
a
fatal
thing
to
let
your
eyes
rest
upon
a
witch
chapter
xii
orson
s
mistake
with
bent
head
and
covered
eyes
berry
stumbled
toward
the
trees
and
at
the
sound
of
her
approach
orson
promptly
extinguished
his
pipe
the
tiny
light
that
berry
had
mistaken
for
a
witch
lantern
having
been
the
match
he
had
used
in
lighting
it
the
little
girl
had
just
reached
the
clump
of
trees
when
close
at
hand
a
voice
called
halt
what
seek
ye
at
the
orson
was
so
close
to
berry
that
he
could
have
touched
her
and
berry
gave
a
little
gasp
of
terror
at
the
sound
of
a
voice
coming
apparently
from
the
tree
itself
but
her
question
was
ready
and
although
her
voice
faltered
a
little
orson
could
hear
distinctly
if
you
please
kind
witch
i
want
to
know
where
mollie
bragg
is
and
when
i
will
see
her
said
berry
do
you
intend
to
obey
and
promise
what
i
require
if
i
answer
growled
the
voice
so
near
to
berry
that
she
gave
a
little
backward
start
to
obey
a
witch
seemed
rather
a
dreadful
undertaking
but
berry
did
not
hesitate
i
do
she
faltered
tis
well
you
promise
to
come
to
this
tree
each
day
to
look
under
a
flat
rock
at
its
roots
and
when
you
find
a
letter
there
to
take
it
and
run
your
swiftest
until
you
give
it
to
the
person
whose
name
is
written
upon
it
growled
the
voice
i
promise
said
berry
it
seemed
to
the
little
girl
that
the
witch
chuckled
and
then
there
was
a
moment
s
silence
the
wind
died
away
the
thrashing
branches
of
the
forest
trees
gradually
lessened
stars
shone
out
from
among
the
drifting
clouds
and
the
darkness
of
the
night
grew
less
dense
berry
heard
the
movement
of
some
large
body
close
beside
her
and
knew
that
the
witch
would
soon
vanish
but
tell
me
of
mollie
she
called
anxiously
boy
mollie
will
soon
return
watch
for
letters
came
the
response
from
some
little
distance
and
now
berry
uncovered
her
eyes
and
lifted
her
bowed
head
boy
she
repeated
in
amazement
witches
don
t
know
everything
after
all
she
decided
and
it
was
so
dark
how
could
it
see
i
didn
t
wear
a
dress
and
berry
was
conscious
of
a
vague
disappointment
as
she
turned
back
toward
the
cabin
but
the
witch
had
said
mollie
would
soon
return
and
berry
told
herself
that
this
news
was
worth
all
her
trouble
then
she
recalled
her
promise
and
wondered
about
the
letter
to
carry
a
witch
s
letter
would
she
thought
be
something
that
had
never
before
happened
to
a
little
girl
she
wished
she
could
tell
her
mother
of
this
wonderful
encounter
with
a
witch
but
lily
had
said
that
one
must
never
tell
of
such
things
or
the
witches
would
be
angry
so
berry
made
her
way
back
through
the
shadowy
forest
climbed
into
her
and
crept
noiselessly
into
bed
but
she
lay
long
awake
thinking
over
her
wonderful
adventure
at
the
witch
s
tree
orson
was
well
pleased
at
his
success
in
securing
berry
nees
s
promise
to
watch
for
any
message
the
witch
might
leave
at
the
he
lurked
behind
a
stout
oak
until
the
little
girl
had
made
her
way
up
the
trail
and
then
started
back
toward
his
camp
if
this
boy
could
run
as
fast
as
berry
had
boasted
he
knew
it
might
prove
the
means
of
defeating
general
grant
when
that
officer
should
decide
to
attack
the
confederates
and
assured
himself
that
he
had
been
very
clever
indeed
in
making
berry
believe
that
she
had
really
encountered
a
witch
orson
knew
that
grant
was
determined
to
push
on
to
the
memphis
and
charleston
railroad
and
that
beauregard
hoped
to
surprise
and
capture
the
union
army
of
the
cumberland
to
send
the
confederate
general
news
of
grant
s
approach
would
be
a
great
triumph
for
this
spy
and
might
as
he
well
realized
bring
him
a
reward
in
the
approval
of
jefferson
davis
the
head
of
the
southern
confederacy
it
was
therefore
natural
that
he
should
think
himself
very
clever
in
securing
berry
s
promise
to
become
his
messenger
ever
since
he
had
overheard
lily
s
story
of
the
he
had
lurked
about
the
place
confident
that
berry
nees
intended
to
ask
a
favor
of
the
witches
and
on
discovering
the
honey
and
cake
he
had
promptly
established
himself
close
to
the
tree
thinking
if
berry
braved
the
darkness
and
the
high
wind
it
would
be
a
good
proof
of
the
boy
s
courage
and
orson
was
well
pleased
to
find
berry
so
fearless
plucky
little
chap
he
thought
approvingly
and
almost
regretted
that
he
had
not
openly
told
berry
the
service
he
meant
to
ask
but
on
the
whole
he
decided
he
had
chosen
the
better
way
he
was
glad
that
he
could
now
start
off
toward
the
tennessee
river
where
he
could
keep
a
sharp
outlook
for
any
advance
of
the
union
army
berry
had
not
the
slightest
idea
as
she
sped
along
through
the
darkness
that
close
behind
her
came
lily
or
that
when
the
voice
had
called
halt
lily
trembling
with
terror
had
nevertheless
moved
a
step
nearer
to
her
little
mistress
ready
if
need
be
to
risk
any
danger
to
herself
in
defense
of
berry
she
had
been
so
frightened
at
berry
s
question
that
it
was
a
wonder
she
had
not
screamed
aloud
but
when
orson
responded
calling
berry
boy
lily
regained
her
courage
dat
ain
no
witch
she
promptly
decided
for
the
negroes
of
the
southern
plantations
firmly
believed
in
the
existence
of
unseen
creatures
which
they
called
witches
that
knew
far
more
than
mortals
and
lily
was
sure
that
a
true
witch
could
not
be
deceived
and
instantly
she
remembered
the
man
berry
had
met
at
the
brook
and
whom
they
had
seen
at
his
forest
camp
i
reckon
dat
man
am
a
makin
believe
jes
ter
skeer
my
missie
or
else
he
be
up
to
somethin
decided
lily
and
as
berry
turned
toward
home
lily
moved
quickly
after
the
shadowy
figure
that
was
rapidly
making
its
way
from
tree
to
tree
it
did
not
take
lily
long
to
discover
that
she
was
right
in
her
suspicion
and
to
recognize
the
tall
shadowy
figure
as
that
of
the
woodsman
whom
she
had
seen
roasting
a
partridge
near
the
ledge
where
she
had
discovered
berry
de
misserbul
critter
lily
muttered
angrily
to
herself
an
who
know
w
ot
place
he
wan
my
missie
ter
kerry
a
letter
to
i
jes
kal
ate
i
ll
get
dat
air
letter
and
lily
now
hastened
after
berry
reaching
the
cabin
just
in
time
to
see
her
young
mistress
clamber
into
the
open
window
with
a
sigh
of
relief
lily
crept
silently
to
her
own
room
although
she
had
gone
to
sleep
very
early
that
evening
she
had
awakened
an
hour
before
berry
left
the
cabin
and
prompted
by
a
vague
fear
in
regard
to
the
safety
of
her
young
mistress
lily
had
cautiously
made
her
way
through
the
shadowy
rooms
to
the
door
of
berry
s
chamber
and
curled
herself
up
there
her
quick
ear
had
instantly
followed
berry
s
movement
toward
the
window
and
she
had
been
close
behind
the
adventurous
little
girl
as
berry
scrambled
down
the
trunk
of
the
oak
tree
both
the
girls
slept
late
the
next
morning
and
arnold
watched
berry
a
little
anxiously
for
the
little
girl
seemed
unusually
serious
i
believe
berry
misses
mollie
bragg
more
than
we
have
realized
she
said
to
arnold
after
berry
had
gone
out
to
work
in
her
garden
where
the
iris
was
already
several
inches
high
and
where
the
transplanted
butterwort
was
in
blossom
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
the
braggs
return
to
their
cabin
arnold
replied
bragg
is
such
a
coward
that
the
sight
of
the
marching
troops
of
either
the
confederate
or
union
army
will
start
him
off
and
he
will
not
be
welcomed
by
any
community
where
brave
men
are
willing
to
fight
for
what
they
believe
to
be
it
was
very
hard
for
arnold
to
feel
that
he
could
not
serve
his
country
he
realized
now
that
from
this
remote
cabin
perched
on
the
side
of
a
ridge
of
the
mountains
of
tennessee
he
might
watch
the
advance
of
general
grant
s
army
of
the
cumberland
moving
toward
corinth
to
attack
the
forces
of
general
johnston
not
for
a
moment
did
arnold
imagine
that
the
task
of
the
union
army
would
be
one
of
defense
or
that
on
the
heights
of
shiloh
the
confederates
would
surprise
and
very
nearly
overcome
the
army
of
the
cumberland
nor
could
it
possibly
occur
to
him
that
his
small
daughter
was
to
render
a
great
service
to
the
union
cause
and
to
be
long
remembered
as
the
yankee
girl
of
berry
busy
in
her
garden
thought
over
her
adventure
of
the
previous
night
and
wondered
if
the
witch
was
right
in
saying
that
mollie
would
soon
return
father
thinks
they
will
come
back
she
reminded
herself
for
berry
could
not
forget
that
the
witch
had
failed
to
discover
that
it
was
a
little
girl
who
had
asked
assistance
nevertheless
berry
was
resolved
that
not
a
day
should
pass
without
her
visiting
the
clump
of
near
the
stream
that
she
might
keep
her
promise
to
the
witch
and
deliver
any
letter
she
might
find
there
and
quite
unknown
to
her
young
mistress
lily
had
resolved
to
be
the
first
to
discover
any
letter
hidden
at
the
witch

chapter
xiii
berry
receives
a
message
lily
s
as
berry
called
the
receptacle
in
which
the
negro
girl
so
carefully
stored
each
feather
that
she
could
secure
was
missing
from
her
belt
one
morning
and
berry
at
once
announced
the
fact
your
lily
have
you
forgotten
it
she
asked
as
lily
appeared
at
the
corner
of
the
cabin
and
stood
watching
berry
who
was
busily
engaged
in
transplanting
woodland
violets
to
the
shady
corner
of
her
garden
no
missie
berry
i
knows
jes
whar
dat
bag
is
yas
m
i
se
got
it
hid
up
safe
lily
responded
with
her
usual
nods
and
chuckles
i
se
got
all
de
feathers
i
wants
she
added
well
you
must
have
nearly
enough
to
stuff
a
pillow
berry
declared
wishing
that
lily
would
tell
her
what
she
intended
to
do
with
the
treasured
feathers
but
lily
only
repeated
yas
m
and
berry
went
on
with
her
work
lily
immediately
vanished
and
did
not
again
appear
until
it
was
time
for
her
to
help
with
the
midday
meal
i
do
wonder
where
lily
goes
and
what
she
is
up
to
berry
confided
to
her
mother
every
day
she
suddenly
disappears
and
is
gone
for
an
hour
or
two
she
always
comes
back
looking
as
well
pleased
with
herself
as
if
she
had
just
discovered
a
pot
of
why
do
you
not
ask
her
where
she
goes
questioned
arnold
very
likely
she
only
goes
off
by
herself
for
a
nap
for
she
is
up
very
early
each
i
have
asked
her
berry
responded
and
she
just
chuckles
and
nods
and
says
that
she
hasn
t
been
anywhere
jes
kinder
perspectin
roun
that
s
what
she
says
and
arnold
smiled
at
berry
s
imitation
of
lily
s
voice
and
manner
but
it
was
only
a
few
days
after
this
when
berry
coming
into
the
discovered
lily
peeping
out
from
berry
s
chamber
lily
what
are
you
doing
in
my
room
she
called
sharply
and
the
surprised
lily
gazed
at
her
a
little
fearfully
i
jes
stepped
in
to
take
yo
somefin
somefin
ter
s
prise
yo
she
finally
found
courage
to
say
for
berry
did
not
usually
speak
in
so
sharp
a
tone
and
lily
was
sure
that
she
herself
was
to
blame
i
wasn
t
lookin
fer
yo
missie
she
went
on
as
if
to
excuse
herself
for
some
fault
but
berry
pushed
past
the
negro
girl
and
entered
her
chamber
her
quick
glance
went
straight
to
the
dainty
and
with
an
admiring
exclamation
she
ran
across
the
room
and
stood
looking
eagerly
at
the
prettiest
basket
she
had
ever
seen
it
was
shaped
like
a
shallow
bowl
and
at
the
first
glance
berry
thought
it
was
made
entirely
of
feathers
but
the
feathers
were
only
skilfully
woven
in
broad
bands
through
the
that
formed
the
warp
of
the
basket
the
woof
was
of
the
fragrant
cedar
roots
these
lily
had
split
and
polished
until
they
shone
like
silver
bands
it
was
indeed
a
beautiful
piece
of
work
and
lily
s
surprise
was
a
great
success
the
negro
girl
had
never
before
been
so
praised
and
thanked
and
when
and
arnold
were
called
to
come
and
admire
lily
s
basket
and
when
they
also
said
that
it
was
the
finest
basket
they
had
ever
seen
lily
was
as
happy
as
it
was
possible
for
a
girl
to
be
who
taught
you
lily
questioned
arnold
and
lily
told
of
the
old
negroes
at
the
plantation
from
which
she
had
fled
who
were
expert
basket
makers
i
hears
tell
dey
learned
ter
make
baskets
fore
dey
was
fetch
to
dis
country
she
said
and
arnold
remembered
having
seen
feather
baskets
that
were
brought
from
africa
and
that
s
what
you
wanted
feathers
for
and
that
s
what
you
have
been
doing
when
i
wondered
where
you
were
berry
exclaimed
and
she
was
now
eager
to
learn
how
to
make
just
such
a
basket
and
lily
promised
to
at
once
begin
gathering
more
feathers
the
basket
henceforth
was
one
of
berry
s
chief
treasures
and
years
afterward
in
her
new
england
home
she
would
often
show
it
and
tell
of
lily
s
as
the
days
went
on
berry
was
constantly
discovering
how
many
things
lily
knew
not
the
same
things
i
know
she
explained
to
her
mother
but
wonderful
things
lily
can
make
all
sorts
of
things
out
of
tiny
twigs
she
can
make
dolls
and
birds
cranes
that
look
just
like
those
that
father
and
i
have
seen
along
the
and
lily
could
indeed
twist
the
pliant
willow
twigs
into
many
shapes
over
which
berry
would
laugh
delightedly
the
spring
days
went
rapidly
by
and
it
was
now
months
since
the
arnolds
had
received
any
word
from
their
soldier
son
francis
and
visits
to
the
on
the
corinth
road
only
brought
disappointment
one
morning
toward
the
end
of
march
after
her
unfailing
daily
visit
to
the
clump
of
berry
decided
to
visit
the
box
and
then
to
go
on
to
the
braggs
cabin
and
see
if
there
was
any
sign
of
the
witch
s
promise
of
mollie
s
speedy
return
coming
true
much
to
berry
s
surprise
there
was
something
in
the
box
but
she
quickly
discovered
that
it
was
not
the
letter
for
her
hand
had
closed
on
a
smooth
roll
of
berry
drew
it
out
and
looked
at
it
wonderingly
there
were
a
number
of
letters
traced
on
its
smooth
surface
i
wonder
who
put
this
in
our
box
she
said
aloud
and
then
suddenly
she
waved
the
bark
triumphantly
and
exclaimed
mollie
mollie
did
it
she
makes
letters
just
that
way
this
means
mollie
s
home
and
berry
started
off
toward
the
wood
road
leading
to
the
braggs
cabin
sure
that
mollie
would
come
running
to
welcome
her
and
thinking
happily
of
all
she
would
have
to
tell
and
of
all
mollie
s
probable
adventures
of
which
she
would
hear
she
looked
eagerly
for
some
trace
of
smoke
rising
from
the
cabin
chimney
but
there
was
none
to
be
seen
and
as
she
came
to
the
rough
clearing
about
the
cabin
berry
stopped
suddenly
they
re
not
there
she
exclaimed
for
the
windows
were
still
boarded
over
and
there
was
no
sign
that
the
dilapidated
cabin
was
again
inhabited
berry
standing
near
a
sheltering
clump
of
fir
trees
felt
almost
ready
to
cry
over
her
disappointment
she
still
held
the
roll
of
bark
in
her
hand
and
now
again
looked
at
it
the
letters
and
were
clumsily
traced
with
a
bit
of
charcoal
on
the
smooth
surface
of
the
bark
and
were
followed
by
the
lines
and
curves
such
as
mollie
had
drawn
on
the
slate
during
the
lesson
hour
in
the
arnolds
i
am
sure
mollie
wrote
these
berry
whispered
and
that
she
put
them
in
our
box
as
a
message
to
me
she
must
have
been
here
and
berry
s
eyes
again
turned
anxiously
toward
the
cabin
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
to
indicate
that
the
braggs
had
returned
berry
decided
that
she
would
go
home
by
a
woodland
trail
that
led
from
the
back
of
the
cabin
through
a
thick
growth
of
forest
trees
toward
the
stream
which
ran
down
from
the
shiloh
plateau
and
she
walked
slowly
across
the
clearing
and
to
the
back
of
the
cabin
her
feet
made
no
noise
and
as
she
turned
the
corner
of
the
cabin
she
heard
the
familiar
voice
of
bragg
and
saw
that
the
back
door
was
ajar
berry
s
first
impulse
was
to
run
toward
the
open
door
but
at
that
moment
she
heard
bragg
say
no
mollie
how
many
times
must
i
tell
ye
that
yer
can
t
see
berry
arnold
didn
yer
pa
warn
us
ter
keep
ter
ourselves
till
he
lets
us
know
which
army
s
gwine
ter
win
i
reckon
we
kin
stan
bein
a
little
hungry
an
i
reckon
berry
s
fergot
ye
fore
this
oh
bragg
i
haven
t
berry
exclaimed
darting
forward
and
pushing
open
the
cabin
door
why
don
t
you
want
us
to
know
you
are
home
oh
mollie
i
m
so
glad
to
see
you
and
berry
ran
toward
the
thin
little
figure
that
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
had
jumped
up
from
the
wooden
stool
in
a
far
corner
of
the
room
oh
berry
berry
sobbed
mollie
as
she
felt
berry
s
firm
arms
holding
her
tightly
and
for
a
moment
the
two
little
friends
quite
forgot
bragg
and
everything
except
the
joy
of
seeing
each
other
again
it
was
mollie
who
spoke
first
my
nice
dress
is
spoiled
she
said
and
berry
s
swift
glance
noticed
that
the
serge
skirt
had
evidently
been
torn
and
clumsily
mended
and
the
blouse
showed
that
it
had
received
hard
wear
the
kitchen
was
cold
and
dark
and
bragg
explained
that
bragg
had
warned
her
not
to
start
a
fire
for
fear
some
wandering
spy
might
discover
that
the
cabin
was
inhabited
steve
says
corinth
is
chuck
full
of
confederate
soldiers
and
that
the
yankee
soldiers
have
landed
at
crump
s
landing
not
more
n
ten
miles
from
here
the
yanks
tore
up
a
good
stretch
of
railroad
between
corinth
an
columbus
an
steve
says
thar
s
more
yanks
on
the
march
from
columbia
an
steve
jes
put
off
ter
the
mountains
he
ll
cum
back
soon
s
these
pesky
armies
goes
off
bragg
explained
as
if
thinking
it
only
natural
that
steve
should
flee
from
any
possible
danger
but
we
have
fires
bragg
and
no
american
soldier
confederate
or
yankee
would
harm
you
berry
declared
why
bragg
perhaps
your
own
boy
len
might
get
a
chance
to
come
and
see
you
if
the
confederates
come
this
way
and
if
the
cabin
is
all
shut
up
he
would
think
you
had
all
gone
away
and
he
would
go
off
and
you
wouldn
t
see
him
said
berry
eagerly
for
a
moment
bragg
stared
at
her
little
visitor
in
amazement
then
moving
toward
the
fireplace
she
exclaimed
my
lan
that
be
the
very
truth
yo
gals
fetch
me
some
kindlin
an
i
ll
start
up
a
blaze
an
i
ll
wrench
them
boards
off
n
the
windows
and
open
the
front
but
a
shrill
scream
from
mollie
brought
her
mother
s
plans
to
a
sudden
end
looking
toward
the
open
door
mollie
had
discovered
a
stranger
a
young
negro
boy
stood
there
peering
anxiously
into
the
cabin
for
lily
never
permitted
berry
to
be
long
out
of
her
sight
and
had
followed
her
to
the
and
then
on
to
the
braggs
cabin
it
s
only
lily
berry
explained
she
is
living
with
us
and
wearing
francis
s
old
clothes
because
they
are
easier
to
go
about
the
woods
dat
s
so
agreed
lily
solemnly
looking
first
at
mollie
and
then
at
bragg
i
declar
exclaimed
bragg
wal
then
she
can
take
hold
and
holp
us
git
this
cabin
fit
ter
live
in
ter
think
i
didn
t
project
len
comin
this
way
and
bragg
was
now
as
eager
to
get
a
fire
started
to
open
the
windows
and
give
the
cabin
the
look
of
being
in
use
as
a
few
hours
earlier
she
had
been
to
hide
away
from
any
possible
visitor
it
s
a
blessin
you
happened
this
way
berry
she
declared
yo
jes
tuck
that
roll
of
nice
under
those
sticks
she
added
noticing
the
roll
of
bark
on
which
mollie
s
message
was
traced
that
berry
still
held
with
a
smiling
glance
at
mollie
berry
promptly
obeyed
and
in
a
moment
the
bark
blazed
up
the
kindlings
caught
fire
and
a
cheerful
glow
and
warmth
filled
the
room
with
the
help
of
berry
and
lily
the
boards
were
taken
from
the
cabin
windows
and
bragg
did
her
best
to
put
the
poor
rooms
in
order
when
berry
declared
it
was
time
for
her
to
start
for
home
bragg
cheerfully
consented
for
mollie
to
go
with
her
and
with
lily
close
behind
them
the
two
little
friends
made
their
way
along
the
forest
trail
berry
listened
eagerly
to
mollie
s
story
of
the
wandering
life
the
braggs
had
led
since
leaving
their
cabin
we
visited
paw
s
cousin
first
mollie
explained
but
he
wanted
paw
to
jine
up
with
the
tennessee
sojers
an
go
ter
corinth
but
paw
don
b
lieve
in
fightin
so
we
went
on
we
lived
in
a
cave
fer
a
spell
an
berry
mos
days
i
ve
bin
hungry
concluded
the
poor
little
mountain
girl
looking
up
at
her
friend
as
if
appealing
for
protection
well
you
shan
t
be
hungry
again
mollie
berry
promised
and
we
have
lots
of
new
maple
syrup
and
i
ll
ask
mother
to
make
for
our
dinner
mollie
s
pale
eyes
brightened
at
this
unexpected
delight
she
was
sure
her
troubles
were
over
now
that
berry
was
with
her
i
hoped
you
could
read
what
i
wrote
on
the
she
said
as
they
came
in
sight
of
the
arnolds
cabin
i
put
it
in
the
box
day
before
yesterday
oh
berry
i
m
so
glad
we
have
a
fire
in
our
kitchen
she
added
solemnly
with
a
little
shiver
in
remembrance
of
the
dark
chilly
cabin
where
she
and
her
mother
had
remained
in
hiding
for
several
days
without
warmth
or
light
arnold
gave
mollie
a
warm
welcome
and
when
late
that
afternoon
the
little
girl
started
for
home
lily
carrying
a
basket
filled
with
food
went
with
her
and
berry
promised
to
be
at
the
brook
in
the
place
where
she
and
mollie
always
planned
to
meet
by
an
early
hour
the
next
forenoon
that
evening
berry
told
her
mother
and
father
the
story
of
the
braggs
wanderings
and
of
the
hardships
mollie
and
her
mother
had
suffered
wouldn
t
it
be
fine
if
len
could
only
come
home
and
help
them
said
berry
as
she
finished
the
story
he
may
be
here
at
any
time
for
his
regiment
is
probably
in
corinth
arnold
responded
gravely
i
do
not
believe
the
confederates
mean
to
wait
for
grant
s
army
to
attack
them
the
spies
of
general
johnston
and
general
beauregard
will
keep
them
informed
each
day
of
the
advance
of
general
buell
s
troops
beauregard
is
used
to
winning
with
the
laurels
of
fort
sumter
and
manassas
fresh
in
his
mind
he
may
decide
to
advance
upon
grant
s
forces
at
once
len
bragg
is
with
beauregard
s
army
and
may
find
himself
near
home
any
that
will
be
splendid
berry
declared
smiling
happily
at
the
thought
of
the
pleasure
of
mollie
and
bragg
if
len
should
suddenly
appear
but
arnold
shook
his
head
anything
but
that
berry
he
replied
if
beauregard
s
army
surprises
the
forces
of
grant
and
buell
it
might
mean
the
capture
of
the
army
of
the
cumberland
the
confederate
troops
must
be
nearly
equal
in
numbers
to
those
of
the
union
forces
if
beauregard
could
take
grant
by
surprise
it
would
indeed
be
a
sad
day
for
the
union
berry
listened
soberly
she
well
knew
that
her
brother
francis
was
fighting
for
the
cause
of
the
union
that
slavery
might
cease
to
exist
and
the
united
states
remain
an
undivided
nation
she
now
began
to
realize
that
war
might
come
very
near
her
cabin
home
that
general
grant
s
men
marching
toward
corinth
might
be
surprised
and
captured
by
the
daring
and
triumphant
beauregard
and
that
night
berry
resolved
to
henceforth
keep
a
sharp
outlook
for
possible
confederate
spies
or
for
any
evidence
of
marching
troops
along
the
corinth
road
if
i
could
let
general
grant
know
that
confederates
were
on
the
march
then
beauregard
could
not
surprise
him
thought
berry
remembering
that
she
knew
all
the
forest
trails
and
woodland
roads
and
that
if
she
kept
a
sharp
watch
no
body
of
soldiers
could
reach
pittsburg
landing
where
her
father
believed
grant
would
land
his
soldiers
over
either
of
the
corinth
roads
without
her
seeing
them
and
no
one
can
run
faster
than
i
can
i
could
get
to
the
union
camp
long
before
the
confederates
and
then
general
grant
would
be
ready
she
thought
not
realizing
any
of
the
dangers
in
store
for
such
a
messenger
just
before
an
impending
battle
i
ll
go
to
the
top
of
the
ridge
twice
every
day
and
i
ll
make
lily
promise
to
keep
a
sharp
watch
resolved
berry
at
first
the
little
girl
thought
she
would
tell
her
mother
and
father
of
her
plan
but
she
remembered
her
father
s
caution
in
regard
to
keeping
out
of
sight
of
wayfarers
along
the
trails
and
said
to
herself
i
ll
wait
until
i
have
seen
real
soldiers
perhaps
until
after
i
have
seen
general
grant
himself
i
guess
my
father
will
be
proud
if
i
run
faster
than
any
confederate
and
so
berry
confided
her
new
resolve
to
no
one
but
lily
and
the
colored
girl
proved
the
best
possible
assistant
chapter
xiv
on
guard
mollie
bragg
wondered
a
good
deal
about
lily
berry
treated
the
colored
girl
as
if
she
had
the
same
right
to
friendship
and
kindness
as
if
her
skin
were
white
in
fact
to
mollie
it
sometimes
seemed
that
berry
was
more
kind
and
thoughtful
toward
lily
than
toward
anyone
else
and
this
sadly
puzzled
mollie
and
one
day
when
the
two
little
friends
were
making
a
playhouse
under
the
big
oak
tree
behind
the
arnold
cabin
mollie
said
berry
lily
s
a
nigger
ain
she
berry
who
was
carefully
building
a
fireplace
stopped
and
gazed
at
mollie
in
astonishment
why
mollie
you
know
just
as
well
as
i
do
that
lily
s
a
negro
girl
my
mother
says
lily
be
any
blacker
she
responded
well
you
treats
her
jes
like
you
treats
white
folks
you
says
please
to
her
when
you
asks
her
to
do
things
an
you
says
thank
you
after
she
s
done
em
i
ve
heard
you
berry
and
mollie
nodded
solemnly
as
if
expecting
berry
would
promptly
deny
it
but
berry
also
nodded
and
only
looked
more
and
more
surprised
of
course
i
say
please
and
thank
you
she
said
and
of
course
i
treat
her
just
as
i
would
a
white
girl
i
guess
i
ought
to
treat
her
better
than
i
do
berry
continued
thoughtfully
because
she
has
never
had
anyone
to
be
kind
to
her
until
she
came
to
live
with
us
lily
can
t
help
being
black
just
suppose
your
skin
was
black
mollie
you
d
be
mollie
just
the
same
inside
of
your
skin
wouldn
t
you
mebbe
i
would
mollie
replied
soberly
and
just
think
how
many
things
lily
knows
that
we
don
t
berry
continued
eagerly
don
t
you
remember
that
wood
pewee
s
nest
she
showed
us
between
the
forked
twigs
of
the
young
oak
tree
near
our
gate
and
the
s
nest
in
the
cedar
tree
and
all
the
stories
she
tells
us
mollie
about
the
thrush
that
pounds
acorns
on
the
ground
until
the
shells
are
broken
and
he
can
get
the
nut
and
she
made
that
beautiful
basket
berry
hesitated
for
a
moment
in
her
list
of
lily
s
achievements
and
then
said
and
anyway
she
is
lily
and
i
like
her
just
as
well
as
if
she
were
mollie
nodded
she
could
understand
berry
s
final
reason
better
than
any
other
to
like
lily
just
because
she
is
lily
satisfied
her
i
likes
you
berry
jes
because
you
are
berry
she
said
and
the
two
little
friends
resumed
their
play
neither
of
them
imagined
that
lily
had
heard
every
word
of
the
conversation
from
her
perch
on
one
of
the
lower
branches
of
the
big
oak
tree
it
was
lily
s
secret
perched
there
among
the
branches
she
could
look
far
down
the
ravine
in
one
direction
and
toward
shiloh
church
in
the
other
and
with
little
danger
of
being
discovered
she
had
just
settled
herself
there
at
the
time
when
berry
and
mollie
arrived
beneath
the
tree
and
so
could
not
help
hearing
mollie
s
questions
and
berry
s
reply
and
as
she
eagerly
listened
to
berry
s
declaration
that
she
lily
knew
many
things
that
the
little
white
girls
did
not
know
that
she
was
just
the
same
inside
her
skin
as
if
she
were
a
white
girl
and
berry
s
assertion
of
affection
toward
her
lily
nearly
tumbled
from
the
tree
tears
came
to
her
eyes
and
a
new
sense
of
happiness
filled
her
heart
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
the
homeless
uncared
for
negro
girl
knew
that
she
was
loved
jes
like
i
was
white
she
whispered
to
herself
and
her
affection
for
berry
deepened
and
she
again
made
solemn
vows
that
no
harm
should
ever
come
near
missie
it
was
the
next
day
when
berry
confided
to
lily
the
news
that
confederate
troops
might
at
any
day
appear
on
the
corinth
road
that
is
unless
the
union
soldiers
march
to
corinth
first
explained
berry
and
lily
my
brother
francis
is
a
union
soldier
he
s
fighting
to
set
you
free
she
continued
her
brown
eyes
resting
solemnly
upon
lily
yas
missie
berry
i
reckon
yo
brudder
would
do
dat
lily
responded
an
yo

questioned

yes
lily
and
you
must
help
me
and
it
must
be
a
secret
not
even
mollie
bragg
is
to
know
cautioned
berry
we
must
begin
she
added
yas
missie
berry
lily
promptly
agreed
whatever
berry
wanted
done
lily
would
do
without
question
but
there
was
something
on
lily
s
mind
that
troubled
her
she
knew
that
berry
made
daily
visits
to
the
ready
to
fulfil
the
promise
to
the
witch
and
lily
now
resolved
to
tell
her
young
mistress
that
the
voice
berry
had
heard
at
midnight
as
the
wind
swept
down
the
ridge
had
been
the
voice
of
the
man
of
whom
berry
seemed
afraid
and
now
the
colored
girl
began
to
wonder
if
this
man
might
not
be
one
of
those
confederates
for
whom
berry
meant
to
watch
missie
berry
yo
knows
w
ot

we

a

fire
by

it
was
now
berry
s
turn
to
be
surprised
but
she
instantly
realized
that
lily
was
right
and
when
lily
added
i
follered
arter
dat
man
an
i
knows
berry
looked
at
her
companion
admiringly
lily
she
exclaimed
my
father
thought
that
man
was
a
spy
and
probably
the
letter
he
means
to
hide
at
the
will
be
for
some
confederate
do
yo
reckons

fer
sum
confedrit
gen
ril
questioned
lily
yes
because
he
has
been
about
shiloh
all
winter
i
m
sure
he
has
keeping
watch
of
the
tennessee
river
so
that
he
could
send
word
of
union
troops
being
landed
and
the
time
i
met
him
at
the
brook
i
bragged
of
how
fast
i
could
run
berry
continued
eagerly
and
that
s
what
made
him
want
me
for
a
messenger
he
must
have
been
hiding
near
the
brook
lily
the
day
you
told
me
about
dat
s
so
missie
berry
an
i
reckon
he
got
de
cake
an
de
honey
lily
responded
regretfully
he
s
exactly
like
the
cupboard
mouse
that
bragg
told
me
about
berry
declared
remembering
how
difficult
it
had
been
for
her
to
secure
the
cake
and
how
much
trouble
she
had
taken
to
please
some
possible
witch
only
to
have
the
woodsman
laugh
at
her
folly
i
ain
nebber
heard
no
story
bout
de
cupboard
mouse
said
lily
and
berry
repeated
it
greatly
to
the
negro
girl
s
satisfaction
dat
am
a
fine
story
missie
an
maybe
we
s
gwine
ter
set
de
cat
af
er
dis
mouse
dat
kep
all
de
cake
ter
hisse
f
she
chuckled
berry
was
sure
that
any
message
this
wandering
spy
might
leave
at
the
tree
trusting
to
her
promise
to
run
her
swiftest
to
deliver
it
to
whomever
it
might
be
addressed
would
be
a
message
of
great
importance
to
both
the
contending
armies
it
might
be
to
inform
general
johnston
of
the
progress
of
grant
s
army
or
it
might
even
tell
when
it
would
be
best
for
johnston
s
troops
to
march
toward
pittsburg
landing
thought
berry
and
her
brown
cheeks
flushed
with
excitement
at
the
possibility
that
she
berenice
arnold
a
little
yankee
girl
from
vermont
of
whom
general
grant
had
never
heard
might
do
this
great
soldier
a
real
service
by
delivering
this
message
whatever
it
might
prove
to
be
into
his
hands
for
the
army
that
knows
first
what
the
other
army
plans
to
do
will
surely
have
the
best
chance
she
gravely
decided
and
resolved
that
it
should
be
through
no
fault
of
hers
if
the
message
did
not
promptly
reach
the
commander
of
the
union
forces
berry
could
now
think
of
but
little
else
than
her
plans
to
outwit
the
spy
she
realized
that
henceforth
a
constant
watch
must
be
kept
that
either
lily
or
herself
must
be
steadily
on
the
alert
so
that
the
moment
a
message
was
deposited
at
the
witch
s
tree
she
could
start
instantly
for
the
race
that
she
firmly
believed
might
result
in
the
triumph
of
the
union
forces
as
all
these
thoughts
went
swiftly
through
her
mind
berry
stood
flushed
and
silent
while
the
negro
girl
watched
her
wondering
what
her
young
missie
was
thinking
about
and
when
at
last
berry
exclaimed
lily
instead
of
standing
here
we
ought
to
be
on
the
outlook
for
that
man
lily
nodded
her
head
soberly
and
promptly
agreed
and
when
her
young
mistress
said
that
lily
must
start
at
once
for
shiloh
church
carefully
keeping
out
of
sight
of
any
possible
traveler
along
the
trails
lily
was
quite
ready
to
obey
and
if
you
see
any
signs
of
him
or
get
a
glimpse
of
him
hurry
back
as
fast
as
you
can
and
tell
me
said
berry
as
lily
started
off
for
a
moment
the
negro
girl
hesitated
she
knew
that
arnold
would
expect
her
to
return
to
the
cabin
with
berry
and
she
remembered
that
there
was
work
for
her
to
attend
to
beside
this
lily
was
sure
that
as
she
could
not
explain
her
absence
arnold
would
think
she
had
purposely
neglected
her
duties
and
as
lily
was
always
eager
to
win
arnold
s
approval
she
now
had
to
choose
between
being
praised
and
approved
by
arnold
for
returning
promptly
and
so
disappointing
berry
or
obeying
berry
s
wish
and
having
arnold
think
her
a
thoughtless
and
ungrateful
girl
but
her
indecision
lasted
only
a
moment
berry
would
always
hold
the
first
place
in
lily
s
affections
to
please
berry
seemed
the
most
important
thing
lily
would
never
forget
that
it
was
berry
who
had
rescued
her
from
the
dangers
and
hardships
of
her
perilous
flight
from
slavery
and
brought
her
to
the
safety
and
comfort
of
her
own
home
so
lily
started
off
toward
shiloh
church
going
almost
noiselessly
along
the
rough
path
as
lily
made
her
way
up
the
slope
she
thought
of
all
the
trouble
this
woodsman
spy
was
making
pears
like
tain
only
dat
he
am
ob
missie
berry
but
he
am
up
trubble
fer
dat

ter
set
me
free
looks
like
i
orter
do
somet
ing
to
dat
spy
to
stop
his
doin
s
she
whispered
to
herself
and
her
thoughts
flew
to
possible
aid
from
witches
but
she
shook
her
head
remembering
how
they
had
failed
her
young
mistress
looks
s
if
i
d
got
to
conjure
up
some
way
by
myse
f
she
decided
and
before
lily
reached
the
woods
that
bordered
on
the
little
clearing
where
stood
the
rough
structure
known
as
shiloh
church
she
had
thought
of
several
plans
by
which
she
could
prevent
this
threatening
stranger
from
being
of
further
trouble
either
to
berry
or
berry
s
brother
or
to
general
grant
but
notwithstanding
the
making
of
plans
lily
s
eyes
had
been
sharply
on
the
alert
for
any
noise
that
might
indicate
someone
near
at
hand
and
she
had
frequently
stopped
to
listen
for
sounds
of
movements
that
would
betray
any
traveler
along
those
mountain
trails
but
beyond
the
bubbling
song
of
the
the
musical
calls
of
the
pewee
and
scarlet
tanager
and
now
and
then
the
rush
through
the
underbrush
of
some
small
woodland
creature
there
was
nothing
to
be
heard
and
a
quick
glance
about
the
clearing
proved
that
there
was
no
lurking
stranger
in
sight
close
by
where
lily
had
halted
grew
a
bunch
of
slender
ash
saplings
and
after
she
had
satisfied
herself
that
there
was
no
one
within
sight
or
hearing
lily
drew
out
the
that
arnold
had
given
her
and
after
carefully
examining
the
size
and
condition
of
the
various
saplings
she
began
to
cut
at
a
branch
of
one
of
the
larger
trees
in
a
short
time
she
was
able
to
break
the
branch
off
without
splitting
it
dat
gwine
ter
make
a
good
nuff
bow
she
decided
with
a
little
chuckle
an
i
reckon
i
kin
cut
off
de
top
of
my
moc
sin
fer
de
cord
an
dar
s
some
fine
in
dat
shed
back
of
de
and
lily
still
careful
to
keep
out
of
sight
of
any
possible
traveler
slunk
along
the
edge
of
the
woods
and
came
out
behind
the
rough
shed
where
arnold
kept
a
store
of
seasoned
wood
for
repairs
on
the
church
it
did
not
take
long
for
her
to
find
a
number
of
slender
pieces
of
hard
wood
of
the
desired
length
for
arrows
and
seating
herself
on
an
old
stump
behind
the
shed
lily
began
to
whittle
one
of
these
into
the
proper
shape
notching
one
end
and
pointing
the
other
end
i
reckon
i
won
mek
but
one
arrow
she
decided
as
she
pulled
off
one
of
her
moccasins
and
with
great
care
carefully
cut
two
slender
strips
from
its
top
with
these
she
proceeded
to
string
the
bough
cut
from
the
sapling
and
although
it
lacked
the
force
and
rebound
of
seasoned
wood
it
nevertheless
proved
equal
to
speeding
the
arrow
with
considerable
force
i
jes
fin
a
chanst
ter
mek
dat
spy
t
ink
he
s
shot
she
thought
as
she
turned
toward
home
realizing
that
hours
had
passed
since
she
had
parted
from
berry
and
beginning
to
dread
arnold
s
questionings
as
to
her
absence
i
reckon
i
cyan
t
say
nothin
jes
kind
of
act
sulky
she
decided
mournfully
but
a
moment
later
she
forgot
her
own
troubles
the
soft
even
pad
of
approaching
footfalls
made
her
scurry
into
the
underbrush
and
conceal
herself
and
she
was
not
a
moment
too
soon
for
she
had
hardly
crouched
behind
a
thick
growing
mass
of
laurel
before
the
hated
figure
of
the
spy
came
into
sight
lily
held
her
breath
until
he
had
passed
her
then
she
stepped
out
noiselessly
into
the
path
behind
him
drew
her
bow
took
careful
aim
and
the
clumsy
arrow
sped
through
the
air
striking
the
man
sharply
on
his
neck
with
a
yell
that
echoed
through
the
silent
woods
he
gave
a
leap
forward
and
fled
as
if
pursued
by
an
army
of
foes
as
indeed
he
for
the
moment
believed
himself
to
be
the
impact
of
the
sharp
pointed
arrow
had
left
its
mark
on
his
neck
a
bruise
that
he
believed
to
be
that
of
a
glancing
bullet
and
he
afterward
wondered
why
he
had
not
heard
the
report
of
the
rifle
and
finally
decided
that
he
had
heard
it
but
he
did
not
turn
back
or
seek
to
discover
his
assailant
but
lily
s
clumsy
arrow
had
made
him
resolve
that
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
in
sending
a
message
to
corinth
and
as
he
crawled
into
a
that
he
believed
secure
he
decided
to
take
no
more
chances
by
traveling
on
trails
if
orson
could
have
seen
the
delighted
lily
as
she
gazed
after
his
fleeing
figure
it
is
probable
that
she
would
have
had
to
flee
for
her
life
for
lily
fairly
danced
with
delight
and
as
she
sped
toward
the
cabin
she
would
frequently
come
to
a
standstill
and
laugh
and
wave
her
bow
in
triumphant
satisfaction
while
she
had
not
really
injured
the
dreaded
stranger
lily
was
sure
that
she
had
frightened
him
and
was
well
satisfied
with
that
meanwhile
berry
had
met
mollie
at
the
brook
as
they
had
agreed
on
and
the
two
friends
turned
toward
the
arnolds
cabin
although
berry
s
thoughts
were
full
of
the
spy
and
the
mysterious
message
she
realized
that
she
must
not
speak
of
them
to
mollie
and
as
she
looked
at
mollie
s
happy
face
and
noticed
how
much
better
the
little
girl
looked
since
the
day
when
berry
had
discovered
the
returned
wanderers
in
their
own
cabin
berry
for
the
time
forgot
her
plans
to
help
the
union
army
and
thought
only
of
what
she
could
do
for
this
friend
who
depended
so
much
on
her
i
am
going
to
teach
you
after
this
mollie
she
said
reaching
out
to
clasp
mollie
s
hand
firmly
in
her
own
as
they
walked
on
side
by
side
you
see
father
is
too
busy
just
now
and
i
am
sure
i
can
help
you
learn
to
oh
yes
why
you
can
teach
me
all
you
know
mollie
agreed
eagerly
thinking
how
fortunate
she
was
to
have
such
a
friend
perhaps
so
responded
berry
a
little
doubtfully
anyway
i
am
sure
i
can
teach
you
to
write
and
then
if
you
ever
go
away
again
you
can
write
i
don
t
want
to
ever
go
away
again
mollie
declared
soberly
remembering
the
weeks
of
uncertain
wanderings
about
the
mountains
during
the
past
winter
weeks
when
she
had
often
known
cold
and
hunger
and
fear
and
that
made
her
rough
cabin
home
seem
a
place
of
comfort
and
safety
and
which
she
hoped
never
again
to
leave
clasping
berry
s
hand
and
tightly
holding
her
birthday
doll
mis
ellen
arnold
to
which
mollie
had
clung
during
all
her
wanderings
mollie
listened
happily
to
berry
s
plan
for
teaching
her
to
write
and
to
learn
wonderful
things
such
as
who
discovered
america
the
places
first
settled
and
of
the
great
rebellion
that
had
made
america
an
independent
nation
arnold
was
standing
at
the
cabin
door
as
the
two
little
girls
came
up
the
path
and
smiled
as
she
noticed
how
eagerly
they
were
talking
and
how
much
better
mollie
seemed
but
where
was
lily
she
wondered
for
there
was
no
sign
of
lily
and
after
greeting
mollie
and
telling
berry
that
she
and
mollie
could
help
themselves
to
a
freshly
baked
ginger
cake
that
was
cooling
on
the
kitchen
table
she
began
to
ask
about
the
missing
lily
where
is
lily
she
questioned
and
much
to
her
surprise
was
obliged
to
repeat
her
question
before
berry
replied
oh
lily
s
so
supposing
the
colored
girl
might
appear
at
any
moment
arnold
did
not
question
berry
further
berry
brought
her
slate
to
the
porch
steps
and
began
to
show
mollie
how
to
trace
letters
and
for
a
time
no
more
was
said
in
regard
to
lily
s
absence
but
as
the
hour
of
noon
drew
near
and
there
was
no
sign
of
her
and
when
arnold
had
several
times
come
to
the
cabin
door
and
looked
down
the
path
in
search
of
the
missing
girl
berry
began
to
feel
uneasy
suppose
after
all
the
stranger
was
in
search
of
runaway
slaves
and
had
recognized
lily
she
thought
fearfully
and
had
captured
the
negro
girl
and
taken
her
away
and
berry
found
it
difficult
to
sit
quietly
beside
mollie
on
the
porch
step
instead
of
rushing
off
to
search
for
lily
came
and
as
they
gathered
at
the
table
lily
was
still
missing
and
now
arnold
also
began
to
feel
anxious
she
wondered
if
it
might
not
be
possible
that
lily
had
tired
of
living
with
them
or
perhaps
becoming
frightened
by
the
rumors
of
advancing
armies
had
again
started
on
her
wanderings
and
she
questioned
berry
very
closely
as
to
probable
reasons
for
lily
s
absence
and
finally
said
after
this
lily
must
remain
in
the
cabin
or
near
at
hand
unless
i
give
her
permission
to
go
with
you
berry
now
that
mollie
is
once
more
at
home
you
can
have
her
for
a
companion
and
will
not
need
lily
with
you
so
berry
listened
hardly
believing
it
possible
that
all
her
plans
could
be
so
overturned
for
she
knew
that
unless
lily
could
go
and
come
without
interference
that
she
might
easily
fail
to
secure
the
spy
s
message
in
time
for
it
to
be
of
any
use
to
general
grant
and
as
her
mother
turned
back
to
the
kitchen
berry
ran
after
her
oh
mother
i
ll
do
lily
s
work
please
do
not
say
she
must
stay
in
berry
pleaded
so
earnestly
that
arnold
looked
at
her
wonderingly
but
she
shook
her
head
no
berry
you
have
your
own
work
to
do
and
nothing
could
do
lily
more
harm
than
to
let
her
run
wild
after
this
i
mean
to
have
her
learn
more
about
household
work
so
that
when
she
leaves
us
she
can
find
a
good
berry
stared
at
her
mother
in
amazement
but
lily
isn
t
going
to
leave
us
ever
i
promised
she
should
always
stay
with
me
she
responded
nearly
ready
to
cry
at
these
new
possibilities
if
lily
could
not
run
about
if
she
was
to
be
kept
indoors
berry
knew
that
she
must
give
up
her
effort
to
defeat
the
spy
if
arnold
wondered
at
her
little
daughter
s
excitement
over
her
decision
she
did
not
speak
of
it
we
will
always
befriend
lily
my
dear
you
know
that
she
said
but
berry
would
not
be
satisfied
with
this
promise
mother
say
that
lily
shall
always
always
stay
with
us
she
urged
i
have
told
her
over
and
over
that
she
should
and
mother
it
will
be
dreadful
if
lily
can
not
go
and
come
as
she
wants
to
why
she
will
think
that
you
are
displeased
with
i
am
displeased
with
her
responded
arnold
she
has
neglected
her
work
and
is
wandering
about
for
her
own
pleasure
look
there
she
comes
and
berry
turned
to
see
lily
coming
up
the
path
swinging
the
clumsy
ash
bow
in
one
hand
and
smiling
radiantly
as
if
very
well
pleased
with
herself
berry
started
to
run
to
meet
her
feeling
sure
that
lily
had
important
news
but
arnold
quickly
prevented
this
stop
berry
go
back
to
mollie
i
want
to
speak
to
lily
you
can
see
that
i
was
quite
right
she
has
been
making
a
bow
and
arrows
and
playing
about
in
the
please
mother
don
berry
began
but
arnold
only
shook
her
head
and
berry
had
only
time
to
wave
a
welcoming
hand
toward
her
faithful
messenger
before
lily
reached
the
porch
lily
at
once
realized
that
her
fears
in
regard
to
arnold
s
disapproval
were
justified
she
made
no
effort
to
explain
her
absence
but
stood
with
bowed
head
and
downcast
eyes
while
arnold
told
her
that
all
the
work
expected
of
her
had
been
delayed
and
added
that
henceforth
she
was
not
to
go
out
of
sight
of
the
cabin
without
permission
lily
listened
silently
when
arnold
had
finished
the
colored
girl
dropped
the
weapon
she
had
so
cleverly
made
and
turned
diligently
toward
the
work
of
the
cabin
it
was
nightfall
before
she
found
an
opportunity
to
tell
berry
of
her
successful
shot
at
the
spy
and
of
his
flight
along
the
trail
but
berry
was
too
anxious
about
the
fact
that
lily
was
no
longer
to
be
free
to
go
and
come
to
praise
her
for
her
clever
shot
and
poor
lily
who
was
quite
willing
to
bear
arnold
s
blame
hard
as
that
might
be
if
berry
was
only
pleased
went
about
her
usual
duties
with
so
solemn
an
air
that
arnold
became
sorry
for
the
girl
and
feared
that
she
had
been
too
severe
with
her
it
was
toward
sunset
when
mollie
started
for
home
it
had
been
rather
an
unhappy
day
for
the
little
girl
for
after
arnold
s
decision
in
regard
to
lily
berry
s
interest
in
mollie
s
lesson
vanished
she
became
impatient
with
all
mollie
s
attempts
to
write
and
all
mollie
s
efforts
to
please
her
were
of
no
avail
nor
did
berry
notice
the
tears
in
mollie
s
eyes
as
the
little
girl
bade
her
i
ll
write
better
berry
i
know
i
will
mollie
faltered
as
clasping
her
shabby
beloved
doll
she
started
to
join
arnold
who
had
offered
to
walk
as
far
as
the
brook
with
her
i
don
t
care
how
you
write
berry
had
carelessly
responded
her
eyes
anxiously
following
lily
and
eager
for
mollie
to
go
that
she
might
hear
whatever
lily
could
tell
her
mollie
gave
a
little
sob
as
she
turned
and
followed
arnold
down
the
path
she
decided
that
she
must
be
so
stupid
that
berry
no
longer
cared
to
teach
her
it
was
the
first
time
berry
had
ever
spoken
unkindly
to
the
little
mountain
girl
arnold
was
quick
to
notice
mollie
s
trouble
and
comforted
the
little
girl
by
saying
that
berry
was
anxious
about
lily
and
when
she
added
i
have
a
skirt
for
your
mother
in
this
package
mollie
the
little
girl
s
eyes
brightened
happily
for
mollie
s
chief
sorrow
was
that
her
mother
had
nothing
for
herself
whatever
mollie
had
she
was
eager
to
share
with
her
mother
arnold
knew
this
and
it
made
her
very
tender
toward
the
little
girl
chapter
xv
soldiers
on
shiloh
ridge
berry
had
not
realized
that
her
words
would
hurt
mollie
s
sensitive
nature
indeed
she
hardly
remembered
what
she
had
said
for
her
thoughts
were
full
of
marching
armies
of
sleeping
soldiers
suddenly
attacked
by
relentless
foes
and
of
herself
as
a
messenger
reaching
the
union
camp
in
time
to
warn
and
save
them
she
went
about
the
cabin
after
her
mother
s
departure
repeating
a
verse
from
a
poem
she
had
learned
that
winter
a
poem
by
sir
walter
scott
down
from
the
hill
the
maiden
pass
d
at
the
wild
show
of

aghast
o
gay
yet
fearful
to
behold
flashing
with
steel
and
rough
with
gold
and
bristled
o
er
with
swords
and
spears
with
plumes
and
pennons
waving
fair
was
that
bright
my

berry
exclaimed
the
admiring
lily
does
yo
reckon

and
at
lily
s
question
berry
quickly
remembered
that
she
should
be
off
to
shiloh
and
keep
watch
the
little
girl
realized
from
her
father
s
anxious
face
and
from
what
he
said
of
the
probable
advance
of
confederate
troops
that
any
hour
might
see
them
on
the
march
i
don
t
know
lily
she
responded
gravely
but
i
m
sure
we
ought
to
keep
watch
all
the
time
and

her
eyes
and

her
head
solemnly
oh

berry
responded
eagerly

promised
lily
and
returned
to
her
work
while
berry
put
on
her
red
cap
and
started
off
for
another
look
along
the
roads
leading
to
corinth
it
was
the
day
of
march
and
on
that
very
day
general
halleck
of
the
union
army
had
informed
general
buell
that
grant
would
attack
the
enemy
as
soon
as
the
roads
are
it
was
to
be
a
deliberate
forward
movement
on
corinth
from
pittsburg
landing
to
be
undertaken
some
days
later
for
the
union
forces
had
no
idea
of
the
confederates
plan
to
surprise
them
by
an
attack
on
pittsburg
landing
the
river
banks
at
the
landing
rise
eighty
feet
above
the
river
but
are
cloven
by
a
series
of
ravines
through
one
of
which
runs
the
main
road
to
corinth
beyond
the
crest
of
the
acclivity
stretches
a
rough
tableland
on
this
plateau
five
divisions
of
general
grant
s
army
of
west
tennessee
were
camped
feeling
themselves
absolutely
secure
from
any
hostile
visit
and
unsuspicious
of
any
shock
of
battle
and
little
imagining
that
a
small
yankee
girl
was
to
be
the
means
of
saving
them
from
capture
as
berry
ran
along
through
the
forest
she
could
hear
the
cheerful
songs
of
cardinals
and
robins
squirrels
scolded
at
her
as
they
clung
to
the
trunks
of
the
tall
oaks
and
the
air
was
full
of
the
springtime
fragrance
the
silver
chain
and
whistle
hung
about
her
neck
and
berry
gave
them
a
little
loving
touch
thinking
of
the
absent
brother
who
had
given
them
to
her
as
she
came
out
on
the
high
plateau
and
stood
looking
toward
the
tennessee
river
there
was
no
sound
except
the
songs
of
birds
and
the
chattering
of
squirrels
to
break
the
stillness
berry
s
keen
glance
scanned
the
distant
road
but
there
was
no
moving
form
to
be
seen
she
turned
and
looked
toward
shiloh
woods
the
woods
where
confederate
troops
would
lay
on
their
arms
on
the
night
before
the
battle
of
shiloh
were
now
quiet
in
the
spring
sunshine
berry
perched
herself
on
the
stump
of
an
old
tree
and
began
to
wish
that
she
had
asked
mollie
to
be
her
companion
mollie
would
not
imagine
why
i
wanted
to
climb
up
here
and
we
could
play
our
old
games
thought
berry
recalling
the
previous
autumn
when
she
and
mollie
had
made
families
of
dolls
out
of
sticks
and
twigs
with
moss
for
hair
and
with
gowns
of
and
vines
they
had
made
playhouses
among
the
ledges
or
at
the
roots
of
some
big
tree
where
happy
and
undisturbed
they
would
play
for
hours
berry
wondered
if
they
would
ever
again
play
together
on
that
pleasant
hillside
she
had
only
been
resting
a
few
moments
when
she
heard
the
crashing
of
underbrush
on
the
slope
beneath
her
berry
quickly
concealed
herself
behind
a
tree
and
in
a
moment
the
sound
of
loud
voices
the
jingle
of
arms
and
the
noise
of
approaching
feet
made
her
whisper
soldiers
and
it
was
not
long
before
half
a
dozen
men
in
the
blue
uniform
of
the
northern
army
came
out
into
the
open
space
on
top
of
the
ridge
they
were
evidently
tired
from
their
climb
up
the
ravine
and
to
berry
s
surprise
they
apparently
had
no
notion
of
concealing
were
talking
and
laughing
together
as
if
they
had
no
thought
of
war
berry
was
near
enough
to
the
newcomers
to
see
them
distinctly
and
to
hear
every
word
they
said
she
heard
them
speak
of
the
army
in
camp
at
pittsburg
landing
and
gave
a
little
gasp
of
surprise
wondering
if
her
father
knew
that
grant
s
troops
were
so
near
there
ought
to
be
outposts
stationed
all
along
here
she
heard
one
of
the
younger
soldiers
declare
and
another
laughingly
responded
oh
colonel
peabody
the
confederates
won
t
march
over
these
roads
and
gullies
it
s
the
union
soldiers
who
will
go
after
them
at
that
may
be
but
it
would
do
no
harm
to
guard
the
roads
responded
the
young
officer
gravely
berry
waited
to
hear
no
more
it
seemed
to
the
little
girl
that
there
must
be
marching
soldiers
in
every
direction
and
she
crept
noiselessly
away
into
the
shelter
of
the
forest
and
ran
toward
home
eager
to
tell
her
father
of
what
she
had
seen
and
heard
down
the
ravine
she
met
her
father
who
was
on
his
way
home
from
a
visit
to
the
braggs
cabin
father
father
there
are
soldiers
at
shiloh
church
i
saw
them
and
grant
s
army
is
at
pittsburg
landing
berry
exclaimed
clasping
her
father
s
hand
as
if
she
expected
an
army
instantly
to
seize
him
yes
my
dear
and
you
must
now
stay
closely
at
home
the
main
roads
to
corinth
will
be
guarded
by
soldiers
but
our
cabin
is
too
far
from
the
highways
for
us
to
see
them
arnold
quietly
replied
do
you
suppose
we
will
see
general
grant
asked
berry
and
her
father
smiled
down
at
the
little
girl
s
eager
face
he
will
probably
march
on
to
corinth
in
a
few
days
he
responded
and
then
added
the
flare
of
his
can
be
seen
from
shiloh
their
outposts
are
not
more
than
a
mile
from
the
main
line
if
the
confederates
surprise
them
it
will
be
a
terrible
but
they
mustn
t
surprise
them
the
little
girl
exclaimed
earnestly
and
again
resolved
that
she
would
watch
more
closely
than
ever
for
any
sign
of
the
approaching
enemy
when
they
reached
the
cabin
arnold
was
on
the
outlook
for
them
she
and
arnold
spoke
of
mollie
and
her
mother
and
arnold
declared
that
bragg
was
sure
that
len
might
appear
any
day
their
cabin
is
so
far
in
from
the
highway
that
i
think
they
will
be
safe
arnold
said
thoughtfully
and
both
berry
and
her
mother
understood
that
he
was
thinking
that
it
might
be
possible
before
many
days
passed
that
northern
and
southern
troops
would
meet
in
deadly
conflict
along
those
peaceful
country
roads
that
night

followed

when
the
colored
girl
started
toward
the
barn

i

going

chapter

berry
s
morning
lessons
with
her
father
were
now
for
a
time
discontinued
the
little
household
in
the
mountain
cabin
realized
that
the
encampment
of
union
soldiers
at
pittsburg
landing
meant
that
a
battle
was
near
at
hand
and
berry
s
thoughts
as
well
as
those
of
her
mother
and
father
were
absorbed
in
what
general
grant
s
next
movement
might
be
mollie
bragg
came
nearly
every
morning
to
practise
her
lessons
in
writing
and
apparently
had
quite
forgotten
berry
s
thoughtless
unkindness
berry
presented
the
slate
and
pencil
to
the
little
girl
so
that
she
might
use
it
at
home
and
this
gift
made
mollie
sure
that
berry
had
not
meant
to
be
unkind
arnold
had
again
fitted
mollie
out
with
a
neat
dress
of
stout
gingham
bragg
had
made
the
poor
cabin
neat
and
livable
and
had
planted
the
rough
garden
plot
with
early
vegetables
every
day
she
and
mollie
kept
a
sharp
outlook
for
len
but
general
beauregard
was
doing
his
best
to
get
his
forces
at
corinth
ready
for
a
march
on
the
enemy
and
no
absences
were
permitted
but
len
was
to
see
his
mother
and
sister
nevertheless
much
earlier
than
he
then
imagined
lily
s
first
night
of
guard
duty
as
berry
called
it
passed
without
her
seeing
or
hearing
anything
to
awaken
her
fears
the
colored
girl
however
had
slept
for
several
hours
as
she
crouched
against
a
mossy
log
near
shiloh
church
but
lily
was
sure
that
she
would
have
awakened
at
the
slightest
sound
on
her
way
home
in
the
gray
light
of
the
early
morning
she
had
stopped
at
the
and
found
a
sealed
letter
under
the
rock
at
the
roots
of
the
tree
i
reckons
i
ll
let
missie
berry
see
dis
fus
she
resolved
and
followed
berry
s
plan
of
reaching
her
chamber
by
the
help
of
the
old
oak
so
that
berry
was
suddenly
awakened
just
at
daybreak
by
a
gentle
touch
on
her
curly
hair
and
a
whispered
word
missie
berry
missie

de

said
lily
for
a
moment
berry
believed
herself
dreaming
and
rubbed
her
eyes
sleepily
then
instantly
she
was
wide
awake
and
seized
the
letter
it
was
enclosed
in
a
brown
paper
and
tied
with
a
coarse
string
in
the
dim
morning
light
berry
read
for
general
johnston
at
corinth
and
beneath
it
in
large
letters
run
the
two
girls
stared
at
each
other
with
sober
faces
w
ot

questioned
lily
berry
shook
her
head
i
don
t
know
yet
if
i
give
it
to
father
i
would
have
to
tell
him
about
my
going
to
the
at
midnight
she
whispered
i
ll
have
to
think
what
i
will
and
lily
nodded
and
made
her
way
noiselessly
to
the
kitchen
berry
turned
the
letter
over
in
her
hand
to
open
a
letter
addressed
to
another
person
did
not
occur
to
her
but
this
was
a
spy
s
letter
it
must
contain
news
of
the
union
army
secretly
obtained
and
berry
knew
that
it
would
be
of
value
to
the
enemy
and
that
it
would
be
a
service
if
she
could
give
it
to
a
union
officer
i
ll
carry
it
to
the
pittsburg
camp
she
resolved
the
moment
breakfast
was
over
berry
sauntered
out
to
the
porch
and
instantly
disappeared
she
scrambled
down
the
rough
slope
of
the
ravine
and
followed
a
path
just
above
the
corinth
road
it
was
a
day
of
early
april
and
a
damp
mist
lay
over
the
river
and
drifted
in
little
clouds
along
the
hills
berry
had
to
make
her
way
with
some
caution
as
recent
rains
had
made
the
path
boggy
and
uncertain
but
within
an
hour
she
was
in
sight
of
the
rows
of
white
tents
that
dotted
the
rough
plateau
facing
the
tennessee
river
not
a
single
spadeful
of
earth
had
been
thrown
up
for
entrenchments
no
horseman
patrolled
the
encampment
as
berry
stood
for
a
moment
looking
at
what
seemed
to
her
so
wonderful
a
sight
she
heard
the
sound
of
laughter
and
a
moment
later
a
group
of
soldiers
came
from
a
tent
very
near
to
where
she
was
standing
what
s
this
exclaimed
one
of
the
men
as
he
discovered
a
slight
boyish
figure
in
a
flannel
blouse
and
knickerbockers
and
wearing
a
red
cap
standing
directly
in
front
of
him
off
with
that
cap
young
man
don
t
you
know
enough
to
salute
the
officers
of
your
country
s
army
berry
instantly
clutched
at
her
cap
and
bowed
to
each
officer
in
turn
the
three
men
laughed
again
and
one
of
them
whom
berry
now
recognized
as
the
officer
she
had
seen
a
few
days
earlier
at
shiloh
and
who
had
been
addressed
as
colonel
peabody
exclaimed
pretty
good
for
a
southern
lad
what
s
your
errand
at
this
camp
my
boy
if
you
please
colonel
peabody
i
want
to
see
general
grant
berry
replied
soberly
sorry
young
man
but
the
general
is
at
his
headquarters
in
savannah
nine
miles
down
the
river
did
you
call
to
ask
him
to
dinner
responded
the
officer
smiling
kindly
down
at
the
brown
eyes
that
rested
on
his
with
so
serious
an
expression
no
sir
although
i
am
sure
we
would
be
pleased
to
ask
him
to
dinner
began
berry
but
before
she
could
continue
the
officers
evidently
greatly
amused
by
her
response
broke
into
laughter
and
the
man
who
had
first
spoken
said
southern
hospitality
eh
well
this
boy
looks
a
bit
different
from
most
of
those
i
ve
seen
what
do
you
want
he
concluded
a
little
suspiciously
looking
at
berry
so
sharply
that
for
the
first
time
she
began
to
feel
a
little
afraid
this
letter
and
she
pulled
the
message
from
the
pocket
of
her
blouse
i
found
it
and
i
thought
general
grant
would
like
to
see
it
and
berry
held
the
letter
out
toward
colonel
peabody
to
general
johnston
at
corinth
run
he
read
the
inscription
aloud
and
the
three
officers
gazed
at
each
other
in
amazement
and
a
second
later
berry
felt
a
firm
hand
grasp
her
shoulder
so
you
are
a
messenger
for
the
confederate
spy
eh
well
you
have
come
to
the
wrong
camp
what
s
your
idea
in
bringing
this
letter
here
want
to
count
our
troops
pretty
clever
scheme
wasn
t
it
and
the
man
turned
to
his
companions
who
nodded
their
agreement
they
believed
berry
had
been
sent
to
the
camp
to
secure
information
for
the
confederates
and
that
the
letter
had
only
been
an
excuse
colonel
peabody
thrust
it
into
his
pocket
and
keeping
a
fast
hold
of
berry
s
shoulder
led
her
toward
a
tent
guess
we
ll
keep
you
with
us
until
we
march
into
corinth
he
said
giving
her
a
little
push
into
the
tent
where
two
soldiers
instantly
sprang
up
from
a
small
table
keep
your
eyes
on
this
boy
until
i
come
for
him
commanded
the
officer
and
berry
found
herself
alone
facing
the
two
soldiers
one
of
whom
motioned
to
a
wooden
stool
and
said
roughly
sit
down
berry
quickly
obeyed
this
was
a
very
different
reception
than
the
one
she
had
imagined
she
began
to
wish
that
she
had
followed
lily
s
suggestion
and
given
the
letter
to
her
father
once
or
twice
she
started
to
speak
but
one
of
the
men
promptly
commanded
her
to
shut
up
with
so
rough
a
voice
that
berry
did
not
dare
to
continue
she
realized
that
she
was
a
prisoner
in
the
camp
of
the
union
army
and
that
no
one
would
know
where
to
look
for
her
if
i
had
only
told
lily
what
i
meant
to
do
she
thought
mournfully
as
the
hours
passed
and
her
hope
of
a
speedy
release
vanished
but
she
was
resolved
that
in
some
way
she
must
escape
and
was
on
the
alert
for
a
possible
chance
to
slip
out
of
the
tent
once
free
from
the
camp
she
was
sure
she
could
outrun
any
pursuer
the
hour
of
noon
came
and
one
of
the
soldiers
sauntered
out
after
his
dinner
the
other
followed
him
to
the
entrance
urging
him
to
hurry
berry
was
sure
she
would
have
no
better
opportunity
to
make
an
attempt
to
escape
in
a
moment
she
had
slipped
from
the
stool
and
creeping
behind
the
unsuspecting
soldier
she
gave
him
so
sudden
and
unexpected
a
push
that
he
stumbled
and
she
sped
past
him
and
was
off
running
her
best
toward
the
steep
slope
above
which
stood
the
camp
with
a
yell
the
soldier
was
after
her
and
berry
dared
not
look
backward
she
was
sure
the
whole
army
was
in
pursuit
as
she
fled
down
the
embankment
chapter
xvii
the
evening
before
shiloh
it
was
well
on
in
the
afternoon
when
berry
reached
the
cabin
as
mollie
had
not
appeared
that
morning
arnold
supposed
berry
was
with
her
and
had
not
been
anxious
but
berry
now
told
the
story
of
her
adventure
to
which
her
mother
and
father
listened
in
amazement
the
soldiers
did
not
give
me
a
chance
to
tell
them
that
i
was
a
little
yankee
girl
berry
concluded
resentfully
no
pickets
on
guard
and
general
grant
at
savannah
exclaimed
arnold
quite
forgetting
berry
s
experience
with
witches
and
spies
as
berry
described
the
unguarded
camp
at
pittsburg
landing
if
johnston
and
beauregard
discover
these
things
they
will
attack
at
once
he
said
thoughtfully
perhaps
that
letter
was
to
tell
them
said
berry
adding
i
m
so
hungry
lily
instantly
sped
to
the
pantry
and
in
a
few
moments
berry
was
happily
occupied
with
a
plate
of
corn
bread
and
a
pitcher
of
milk
later
on
her
mother
talked
seriously
with
the
little
girl
telling
berry
of
the
possible
accidents
that
might
have
befallen
her
and
no
one
at
the
cabin
knowing
where
to
look
for
her
and
if
you
had
given
the
letter
to
your
father
my
dear
he
would
have
read
it
and
discovered
if
it
was
of
any
importance
she
concluded
arnold
did
not
ask
any
promise
from
berry
for
she
felt
sure
there
would
be
no
more
midnight
visits
to
the
and
she
did
not
for
a
moment
imagine
that
berry
had
resolved
to
do
guard
duty
for
the
camp
at
pittsburg
landing
a
week
passed
with
heavy
rains
making
the
roads
to
corinth
nearly
impassable
and
convincing
berry
that
there
was
no
need
for
anyone
to
look
out
for
marching
foes
but
although
saturday
morning
the
fifth
of
april
dawned
in
a
furious
rain
berry
resolved
it
was
again
time
for
her
to
visit
the
distant
ridge
but
her
father
was
ill
that
morning
lily
was
kept
busy
at
household
tasks
and
arnold
required
berry
s
assistance
so
it
was
not
until
night
that
berry
could
leave
the
cabin
dark
clouds
were
sweeping
over
the
tops
of
the
forest
trees
as
the
little
girl
lowered
herself
from
the
window
of
her
room
and
made
her
way
through
the
gathering
darkness
to
the
trail
leading
to
shiloh
long
before
her
journey
was
completed
she
heard
strange
sounds
and
muffled
noises
but
the
rain
had
ceased
and
she
went
slowly
forward
stopping
now
and
then
to
listen
but
with
no
idea
that
in
spite
of
rain
and
almost
impassable
roads
the
confederates
had
marched
from
corinth
and
that
in
shiloh
woods
yonder
grimly
awaiting
the
dawn
confederate
troops
lay
waiting
the
command
to
attack
pittsburg
landing
an
army
that
general
grant
believed
to
be
in
corinth
twenty
miles
away
this
stealthily
moving
host
now
lay
on
its
arms
weary
from
its
day
s
march
no
fires
had
been
lighted
and
sheltered
in
the
shadowy
forest
a
council
of
confederate
generals
gathered
in
the
small
clearing
toward
which
berry
was
noiselessly
approaching
the
flicker
of
a
light
attracted
the
little
girl
s
attention
and
she
made
her
way
toward
it
and
in
a
moment
stopped
suddenly
too
amazed
and
frightened
to
comprehend
that
she
was
gazing
upon
one
of
the
important
scenes
in
the
history
of
the
civil
war
resting
on
a
stump
was
a
lantern
a
drum
served
as
a
and
seated
on
a
blanket
close
by
was
general
hardee
and
muscular
general
bragg
who
sat
beside
him
was
wan
and
haggard
his
iron
gray
beard
and
thin
form
in
great
contrast
to
that
of
hardee
s
berry
s
eyes
rested
longest
on
a
dignified
and
martial
figure
that
paced
slowly
from
the
stump
to
the
edge
of
the
group
tall
erect
and
powerful
with
a
gray
military
cloak
thrown
over
his
shoulders

albert
sidney
johnston
commander
of
the
confederate
forces
at
shiloh
might
well
hold
the
attention
of
any
observer
and
berry
never
forgot
her
only
glimpse
of
this
resolute
and
fearless
soldier
who
before
another
sunset
was
fated
to
fall
on
the
field
of
battle
walking
quickly
to
and
fro
was
a
slender
figure
in
gray
uniform
the
soldierly
and
handsome
beauregard
and
generals
breckinridge
and
polk
stood
silent
near
by
berry
crouching
behind
a
stump
could
hear
their
entire
conversation
she
heard
beauregard
declare
that
the
union
camp
was
entirely
unprepared
to
face
an
attack
that
general
grant
was
nine
miles
down
the
river
and
on
the
other
shore
at
that
and
as
he
bade
his
companions
he
confidently
announced
gentlemen
night
we
sleep
in
the
enemy
s
berry
waited
to
hear
no
more
here
was
the
very
opportunity
for
which
she
had
been
waiting
to
be
of
use
to
the
cause
for
which
francis
was
fighting
she
quite
forgot
her
reception
at
the
union
camp
that
morning
of
a
week
earlier
as
she
realized
how
close
at
hand
was
the
attack
upon
them
she
knew
that
no
time
must
be
lost
the
night
was
dark
and
it
would
be
no
easy
matter
for
her
to
find
her
way
along
trails
and
over
the
streams
swollen
by
recent
rains
that
she
must
cross
to
reach
pittsburg
landing
one
clumsy
step
might
plunge
her
down
the
ravine
or
into
the
muddy
waters
of
the
stream
but
she
did
not
consider
these
things
as
she
fearfully
made
her
way
from
the
steadily
moving
sentinels
about
the
sleeping
army
alert
as
they
were
they
did
not
see
or
hear
the
little
figure
that
slid
from
tree
to
tree
in
the
forest
darkness
and
berry
was
soon
on
a
shadowy
trail
that
would
take
her
to
the
corinth
road
leading
to
pittsburg
landing
colonel
peabody
who
commanded
the
first
brigade
of
general
prentiss
s
division
had
read
the
letter
that
berry
had
given
him
but
as
he
believed
it
some
sort
of
a
hoax
gave
it
little
attention
nevertheless
he
was
vaguely
uneasy
that
night
of
april
fifth
over
the
safety
of
the
camp
and
long
after
his
companions
were
asleep
he
paced
about
the
plateau
and
when
a
tired
panting
little
figure
came
running
toward
him
out
of
the
shadows
he
stopped
in
amazement
before
he
could
speak
berry
was
close
beside
him
i
m
not
a
southern
boy
i
m
a
little
yankee
girl
from
vermont
she
announced
before
the
surprised
officer
could
ask
a
question
and
there
are
thousands
of
confederate
soldiers
in
shiloh
woods
who
are
going
to
march
here
early
perhaps
they
are
coming
now
berry
whispered
too
tired
to
speak
aloud
but
she
managed
to
answer
the
officer
s
sharp
questions
without
faltering
and
colonel
peabody
was
quickly
convinced
that
this
tired
little
girl
had
brought
news
that
might
save
the
pittsburg
landing
camp
from
capture
he
now
realized
that
the
little
figure
beside
him
could
hardly
stand
upright
and
lifting
berry
in
his
arms
he
carried
her
to
his
tent
and
set
her
gently
down
on
his
bed
rest
here
brave
little
yankee
he
said
kindly
you
have
indeed
proved
your
berry
heard
his
words
as
if
they
were
part
of
a
dream
almost
instantly
her
eyes
closed
before
she
awoke
the
battle
of
shiloh
had
begun
the
morning
of
sunday
april
sixth
was
already
dawning
as
colonel
peabody
hastened
to
dispatch
five
companies
of
soldiers
down
the
corinth
road
the
divisions
of
mcclernand
prentiss
and
sherman
were
at
once
ready
for
action
while
generals
hurlburt
and
wallace
made
ready
to
defend
the
landing
as
the
union
soldiers
marched
down
the
corinth
road
they
were
met
by
a
rattling
fire
of
musketry
it
was
the
advancing
confederates
instantly
the
woods
were
alive
with
the
yells
of
the
exultant
confederates
the
union
generals
overwhelmed
by
surprise
could
only
do
their
best
to
defend
themselves
general
sherman
s
troops
with
two
batteries
at
shiloh
church
for
a
time
held
off
the
foe
sherman
himself
held
his
surprised
troops
to
their
task
and
was
the
chief
figure
on
the
union
side
that
day
at
shiloh
general
wallace
moved
his
troops
forward
to
sherman
s
assistance
but
the
union
troops
were
forced
steadily
back
toward
the
landing
and
by
afternoon
the
fate
of
the
union
army
was
critical
but
at
this
crisis
nelson
s
division
sent
forward
from
general
grant
s
headquarters
arrived
and
rushed
upon
the
scene
darkness
approached
and
beauregard
called
off
his
troops
confident
that
on
the
morrow
they
could
complete
their
triumph
next
morning
however
the
astounded
confederates
beheld
a
new
enemy
in
the
field
general
buell
s
troops
and
those
of
general
lew
wallace
had
arrived
and
before
monday
night
the
confederate
retreat
had
begun
it
was
conducted
with
masterly
order
and
precision
the
confederates
winning
the
first
day
were
conquered
only
by
the
timely
arrival
of
buell
s
fresh
troops
but
it
is
easy
to
picture
the
disappointment
of
the
brave
beauregard
as
he
led
his
men
back
to
corinth
berry
had
awakened
to
the
roar
of
cannon
the
reports
of
musketry
and
the
calls
of
officers
urging
their
men
forward
she
peered
from
the
tent
door
and
wondered
how
she
could
ever
again
reach
home
for
the
first
time
she
began
to
think
of
how
troubled
and
anxious
her
mother
and
father
must
be
as
they
heard
the
reverberations
of
guns
through
the
ravines
and
realized
that
a
battle
was
under
way
and
discovered
that
their
little
daughter
was
missing
but
i
couldn
t
help
it
berry
whispered
to
herself
with
a
little
sob
i
had
to
her
feet
were
nearly
blistered
and
she
found
it
difficult
to
walk
and
crept
back
to
the
bed
it
was
nearly
dusk
when
a
soldier
stumbled
into
the
tent
opened
a
box
and
muttered
here
the
colonel
said
to
give
you
a
bite
to
eat
and
handed
berry
some
hard
crackers
and
strips
of
dried
beef
there
s
water
in
that
jar
he
said
pointing
to
a
stone
jar
on
a
table
and
berry
drank
thirstily
i
want
to
go
home
she
announced
turning
toward
where
the
soldier
had
stood
but
he
had
vanished
berry
again
found
herself
alone
the
reports
of
artillery
gradually
ceased
darkness
settled
over
the
camp
and
the
little
girl
who
had
brought
the
news
of
the
advancing
enemy
was
apparently
forgotten
chapter
xviii
after
the
battle
berry
s
absence
from
home
on
the
morning
of
the
battle
of
shiloh
made
and
arnold
seriously
anxious
the
fact
that
lily
had
also
disappeared
was
of
some
comfort
however
for
they
knew
the
colored
girl
would
do
her
best
to
protect
and
shield
her
young
mistress
from
any
danger
the
position
of
the
arnolds
cabin
in
the
remote
ravine
was
fortunately
out
of
range
of
the
guns
and
the
terrible
encounters
between
the
confederate
and
union
forces
were
all
several
miles
beyond
the
ridge
that
sheltered
the
cabin
but
sunday
with
the
echoing
sound
of
guns
passed
slowly
by
to
the
nearly
frantic
parents
to
venture
far
from
the
cabin
was
not
to
be
considered
and
added
to
their
anxiety
for
berry
was
the
fear
of
what
might
have
befallen
bragg
and
mollie
but
at
the
approach
of
night
the
sound
of
musketry
ceased
the
roar
of
cannon
died
away
for
a
time
and
a
heavy
rain
began
to
fall
but
with
darkness
came
a
new
sound
union
gunboats
had
come
up
the
tennessee
river
and
began
a
steady
fire
upon
the
confederates
sleep
was
impossible
and
when
monday
morning
came
arnold
declared
that
he
must
go
in
search
of
berry
and
arnold
determined
to
accompany
him
but
as
they
turned
down
the
familiar
trail
two
miles
from
the
cabin
to
the
brook
where
berry
had
met
the
spy
they
could
see
the
dense
smoke
from
the
guns
rising
in
every
direction
and
down
a
road
a
mass
of
confederate
soldiers
in
their
gray
uniforms
dashed
by
it
is
of
no
use
to
go
any
farther
we
may
be
shot
by
stray
bullets
or
taken
prisoners
as
suspicious
strangers
said
arnold
possibly
some
friendly
officer
has
taken
charge
of
berry
and
lily
and
when
the
battle
ends
will
send
them
safely
home
all
we
can
do
is
to
return
to
the
cabin
and
wait
arnold
sadly
agreed
and
they
made
their
way
home
wondering
anxiously
as
to
the
course
of
the
battle
if
the
union
army
had
any
warning
at
all
of
the
advance
of
the
confederates
they
may
be
able
to
defend
the
landing
said
arnold
as
they
again
reached
the
cabin
when
lily
awakened
on
sunday
morning
to
the
sound
of
echoing
artillery
and
when
she
discovered
that
berry
was
not
at
home
she
at
once
understood
what
had
happened
missie
berry
s
at
de
union
camp
she
promptly
decided
an
i
se
gwine
dar
ter
tek
keer
ob
her
and
lily
was
off
like
the
wind
but
she
found
it
no
easy
matter
to
reach
her
destination
after
she
had
left
the
rough
ridge
where
the
arnolds
cabin
stood
and
made
her
way
down
the
ravine
she
was
instantly
in
the
midst
of
moving
masses
of
confederates
and
it
took
all
her
alertness
and
caution
to
avoid
discovery
for
hours
she
crouched
in
thickets
and
once
even
marched
steadily
along
with
a
division
of
soldiers
who
were
driving
union
soldiers
back
toward
the
landing
and
darkness
had
begun
to
gather
before
the
tired
frightened
lily
reached
the
plateau
above
the
tennessee
river
from
where
the
thunder
of
guns
held
back
the
advancing
confederates
slowly
and
cautiously
lily
crept
along
the
embankment
rain
began
to
fall
darkness
came
and
the
confederates
fell
back
and
the
exhausted
lily
crawled
along
and
at
last
found
herself
near
a
tent
i
reckon
i
ll
jes
go
in
dar
she
thought
an
wait
til
dis
rain
stops
and
making
no
more
noise
than
a
woodland
rabbit
lily
softly
crept
under
the
swinging
flap
of
the
tent
but
quietly
as
she
had
entered
ears
as
sharp
as
her
own
and
eyes
accustomed
to
shadowy
woodland
ways
had
discovered
her
who
s
there
called
a
familiar
voice
and
lily
jumped
to
her
feet
and
ran
forward
my
lan
missie
berry
she
exclaimed
ain
i
de
lucky
nigger
ter
cum
right
to
dis
tent
i
se

har
oh
lily
for
a
moment
berry
clung
silently
to
the
faithful
girl
who
had
braved
every
danger
to
reach
her
young
mistress
and
then
quickly
told
the
story
of
her
discovery
of
the
confederates
in
shiloh
woods
and
now
i
want
to
go
home
we
ll

she
exclaimed
eagerly

lily
concluded
and
berry
at
last
agreed
not
to
attempt
to
start
for
home
until
the
next
morning
lily
curled
up
on
the
floor
beside
the
cot
where
berry
lay
and
in
spite
of
storm
and
the
crashing
sound
of
guns
the
girls
were
soon
fast
asleep
on
monday
lily
was
awake
at
an
early
hour
and
left
the
camp
to
skirmish
for
food
it
was
too
serious
a
moment
in
the
great
battle
for
colonel
peabody
to
remember
the
little
yankee
girl
in
his
tent
but
lily
managed
to
secure
a
quantity
of
hard
biscuit
and
refilled
the
water
jug
we
kin
go
home
i
reckon
she
assured
berry
who
was
now
rested
and
eager
to
leave
the
tent
early
that
afternoon
the
sound
of
cheers
echoed
along
the
plateau
and
berry
and
lily
ventured
to
peer
from
the
tent
a
soldier
rushed
past
them
shouting
beauregard
s
men
are
retreating
the
battle
of
shiloh
is
over
praise
de
lawd
said
lily
an
i
hopes
dis
ends
de
by
four
o
clock
the
last
shot
had
been
fired
and
the
union
generals
found
that
in
the
two
days
battle
union
soldiers
had
been
killed
or
taken
prisoners
by
the
enemy
while
the
confederate
loss
was
not
over
men
in
spite
of
berry
s
pleading
lily
resolutely
refused
to
start
for
home
until
night
tain
safe
missie
berry
jes
wait
she
insisted
and
berry
at
last
agreed
it
was
six
o
clock
when
the
flap
to
the
tent
was
drawn
back
and
colonel
peabody
his
arm
in
a
sling
and
a
bandage
about
his
head
stood
smiling
in
the
doorway
thank
heaven
you
are
here
and
safe
he
exclaimed
as
berry
started
toward
him
and
then
discovering
lily
dressed
in
francis
s
old
clothes
added
where
did
this
boy
come
from
from
my
home
it
s
lily
berry
explained
she
s
going
to
take
me
home
the
officer
looked
puzzled
but
asked
no
further
question
in
regard
to
lily
and
a
moment
later
a
soldier
appeared
with
a
pitcher
of
hot
coffee
a
plate
of
fried
eggs
and
bacon
and
another
of
biscuit
he
set
the
food
on
a
rough
table
and
colonel
peabody
at
once
drew
a
stool
toward
it
he
had
hardly
tasted
food
since
the
beginning
of
the
battle
but
he
did
not
forget
his
visitors
and
berry
was
told
to
sit
beside
him
while
lily
was
given
a
liberal
share
they
were
all
too
hungry
to
talk
until
they
had
satisfied
their
hunger
and
colonel
peabody
was
the
first
to
speak
now
little
yankee
girl
tell
me
your
name
or
better
still
write
it
down
for
me
you
will
find
some
paper
and
a
pencil
in
that
box
and
he
pointed
toward
a
wooden
box
at
the
head
of
the
cot
write
your
father
s
name
also
he
added
as
berry
began
to
write
my
brother
francis
is
a
union
soldier
he
s
a
corporal
berry
proudly
announced
as
she
handed
colonel
peabody
the
paper
on
which
she
had
written
her
own
name
and
that
of
her
father
well
i
think
you
should
be
a
general
declared
the
officer
so
your
name
is
berenice
arnold
said
colonel
peabody
and
in
a
thoughtful
tone
he
repeated
berenice
arnold
the
little
yankee
girl
of
shiloh
and
then
added
if
you
had
not
reached
us
when
you
did
with
your
warning
of
the
advancing
confederates
this
camp
would
surely
have
been
captured
general
grant
will
thank
you
missie
berry
i
reckons
we
better
be
startin
whispered
lily
and
before
berry
could
respond
colonel
peabody
rose
to
his
feet
and
said
before
you
go
berenice
i
must
take
you
to
the
hero
of
the
day
general
william
sherman
his
efforts
led
us
to
victory
and
resting
his
hand
on
berry
s
shoulder
the
wounded
officer
moved
toward
the
door
of
the
tent
with
lily
close
at
his
heels
the
union
generals
were
gathered
in
a
tent
near
by
discussing
the
fortunes
of
the
day
general
rousseau
whose
brigade
had
swept
everything
before
it
general
mccook
and
crittenden
who
against
tremendous
odds
had
held
their
stand
at
shiloh
church
and
general
buell
whose
arrival
had
given
victory
to
the
union
forces
were
all
gathered
about
general
sherman
as
colonel
peabody
with
his
two
odd
companions
appeared
in
the
open
doorway
of
the
tent
very
briefly
he
told
the
story
of
berry
s
flight
through
the
forest
on
the
night
before
the
battle
of
shiloh
to
bring
the
news
of
the
stealthy
advance
of
the
enemy
and
with
a
gentle
push
sent
berry
toward
the
general
whose
keen
eyes
softened
as
they
rested
on
the
slender
little
figure
and
as
he
clasped
berry
s
hand
and
smiled
down
upon
her
berry
wished
with
all
her
heart
that
there
was
some
greater
service
she
could
do
for
the
man
who
had
that
day
won
an
undying
fame
later
on
when
berry
attempted
to
repeat
to
her
father
and
mother
what
general
sherman
had
said
to
her
she
found
that
all
she
could
remember
was
that
he
had
called
her
a
brave
little
yankee
girl
and
when
colonel
peabody
summoned
a
tall
young
soldier
to
go
to
the
outskirts
of
the
camp
with
the
girls
that
each
one
of
the
great
generals
had
clasped
her
hand
and
smiled
upon
her
and
repeated
general
sherman
s
words
the
late
april
twilight
had
begun
to
fade
when
and
arnold
from
their
seats
on
the
cabin
porch
heard
the
sound
of
a
clear
whistle
three
times
repeated
berry
s
signal
and
started
to
their
feet
to
see
berry
with
lily
close
behind
her
running
toward
the
cabin
and
when
the
little
girl
told
the
story
of
her
night
watch
in
shiloh
woods
her
journey
to
the
union
camp
and
all
that
had
so
quickly
followed
her
mother
and
father
listened
in
amazement
there
was
no
word
of
blame
for
the
girl
who
had
been
intent
only
on
being
of
service
to
the
cause
for
which
her
brother
was
fighting
we
have
two
soldiers
in
the
family
her
father
declared
proudly
as
she
finished
the
story
of
her
adventures
i
tole
missie
berry
yo
d
know
i
d
tek

ob
her
said
the
smiling
lily
as
arnold
said
to
the
faithful
girl
that
she
had
been
sure
lily
had
followed
her
young
mistress
len
bragg
is
at
home
said
arnold
he
was
wounded
but
not
seriously
in
the
fight
along
corinth
road
and
carried
to
the
cabin
i
have
just
returned
from
there
and
must
go
down
again
chapter
xix
general
grant
the
sunny
april
days
brought
many
blossoms
along
the
tennessee
ravines
near
shiloh
trillium
and
butterwort
arbutus
and
violets
were
to
be
found
and
masses
of
dogwood
bloomed
along
the
slopes
where
only
a
few
weeks
earlier
the
fierce
battle
of
shiloh
had
raged
the
union
fleet
had
moved
down
the
tennessee
beauregard
convinced
that
the
campaign
was
lost
was
about
to
leave
corinth
in
the
possession
of
grant
s
army
and
it
was
felt
that
the
union
cause
would
soon
triumph
in
the
arnolds
cabin
the
little
household
had
returned
to
the
peaceful
occupations
of
the
days
before
the
two
armies
had
come
so
near
to
them
berry
s
garden
flourished
lily
was
becoming
a
servant
and
arnold
was
rapidly
gaining
strength
within
two
weeks
after
beauregard
s
defeat
steve
bragg
had
appeared
at
his
cabin
and
was
as
warmly
welcomed
as
if
he
had
been
a
brave
soldier
returned
from
war
it
was
soon
evident
however
that
a
change
had
come
over
bragg
for
he
at
once
began
to
work
steadily
he
enlarged
the
garden
cut
logs
with
which
he
built
a
shelter
for
the
calf
that
arnold
gave
him
made
repairs
on
the
old
cabin
and
was
so
praised
by
his
wife
and
children
for
his
industry
that
he
firmly
resolved
that
in
the
future
no
one
should
ever
again
truthfully
speak
of
him
as
shiftless
when
he
looked
at
his
wounded
soldier
son
bragg
also
made
many
other
excellent
resolves
it
was
late
in
may
when
arnold
made
his
first
trip
since
the
preceding
autumn
to
corinth
and
brought
back
the
letter
from
francis
who
was
with
the
union
forces
in
virginia
and
wrote
that
he
was
well
but
it
seemed
to
berry
that
her
father
had
other
good
news
he
smiled
so
often
she
noticed
and
berry
had
been
quick
to
see
that
whatever
it
was
her
mother
was
in
the
secret
maybe
it
is
about
going
back
to
vermont
this
summer
she
decided
for
berry
knew
that
her
father
and
mother
were
both
hopeful
that
a
return
to
their
new
england
home
might
soon
be
possible
and
when
arnold
announced
that
she
was
going
to
have
a
party
berry
was
convinced
that
she
was
right
in
her
conclusions
of
course
a
party
means
that
we
are
to
have
the
bragg
family
to
dinner
said
berry
but
arnold
shook
her
head
smilingly
that
s
not
what
this
party
means
although
len
is
so
much
better
that
we
will
ask
them
all
to
come
up
on
next
sunday
this
party
is
a
surprise
she
responded
tell
me
mother
oh
please
tell
me
urged
berry
but
arnold
laughingly
refused
no
my
dear
not
until
the
very
day
comes
and
then
you
are
to
wear
your
white
muslin
dress
i
will
let
out
the
tucks
and
the
seams
so
it
will
do
and
your
roman
sash
and
be
a
real
little
yankee
girl
and
lily
shall
have
a
dress
and
a
white
apron
and
cap
and
i
shall
wear
my
gray
tibet
dress
and
your
father
will
wear
a
white
collar
yes
indeed
it
is
to
be
a
great
occasion
and
arnold
laughed
again
as
if
her
secret
was
one
that
meant
a
great
pleasure
near
at
hand
so
berry
was
greatly
puzzled
and
she
and
lily
waited
expectantly
for
the
day
to
come
when
they
would
be
told
to
discard
knickerbockers
and
blouses
and
put
on
the
dresses
that
were
ready
for
them
and
on
the
morning
of
june
first
berry
awoke
to
find
her
mother
taking
the
white
muslin
dress
from
the
closet
oh
mother
is
the
party
exclaimed
the
little
girl
springing
out
of
bed
and
who
is
it
mother
who
is
coming
you
said
you
would
tell
me
when
the
day
came
and
berry
seized
her
mother
s
arm
and
looked
pleadingly
up
at
her
mother
s
smiling
face
yes
as
soon
as
you
are
dressed
dear
responded
arnold
put
on
your
white
stockings
and
slippers
and
make
these
short
curls
as
neat
as
you
can
and
she
touched
berry
s
brown
hair
and
left
the
room
oh
how
can
i
wait
thought
berry
impatiently
as
she
hurried
to
dress
if
i
was
in
vermont
i
should
think
it
was
either
the
minister
or
aunt
melvina
coming
to
visit
she
decided
as
she
vigorously
brushed
her
brown
curls
when
berry
reached
the
kitchen
she
exclaimed
in
amazement
for
the
table
was
spread
for
six
people
its
coarse
cover
was
white
as
snow
and
the
blue
of
the
dishes
the
glass
dish
filled
with
wild
strawberries
and
the
white
bowl
filled
with
violets
gave
it
a
very
festive
air
lily
in
a
blue
dress
and
wearing
a
white
cap
and
apron
was
busy
at
the
stove
and
arnold
was
just
cutting
out
a
pan
of
rolls
while
berry
s
father
dressed
for
church
as
the
little
girl
exclaimed
stood
in
the
open
doorway
over
which
hung
the
american
flag
who
is
it
who
is
it
that
is
coming
i
should
think
it
was
general
grant
himself
exclaimed
berry
as
she
ran
toward
her
father
before
arnold
could
speak
and
fulfil
her
promise
there
was
the
sound
of
hoofs
the
jangle
of
harness
and
arnold
ran
down
the
path
berry
was
close
behind
him
but
she
suddenly
stopped
short
it
s
colonel
peabody
she
exclaimed
and
then
noticed
a
bearded
man
mounted
on
a
fine
gray
horse
whom
her
father
was
eagerly
welcoming
behind
these
two
officers
rode
the
young
soldier
whom
berry
instantly
remembered
as
the
one
who
had
guided
lily
and
herself
from
the
camp
at
pittsburg
landing
the
two
officers
dismounted
and
the
young
soldier
took
charge
of
their
horses
berry
stood
on
the
path
not
knowing
quite
what
to
do
but
colonel
peabody
came
to
meet
her
and
in
a
moment
berry
was
being
led
toward
that
quiet
unimposing
and
unostentatious
officer
grant
whom
in
neither
public
opinion
nor
his
own
thought
had
marked
out
for
the
mighty
achievements
before
him
illustration
here
is
the
little
messenger
of
whom
i
told
as
berry
heard
colonel
peabody
say
general
grant
here
is
the
little
messenger
of
whom
i
told
you
the
yankee
girl
of
shiloh
she
looked
up
to
meet
the
steady
friendly
glance
of
the
grave
eyes
of
the
great
general
of
the
civil
war
and
it
was
berry
who
walked
beside
him
to
the
cabin
door
and
who
sat
at
his
right
hand
at
that
simple
breakfast
party
where
the
soldiers
feasted
on
hot
rolls
and
coffee
and
praised
the
broiled
chicken
and
hominy
that
arnold
and
lily
had
so
carefully
prepared
the
visit
was
a
brief
one
within
an
hour
the
party
was
over
and
general
grant
and
his
companions
were
again
on
horseback
as
berry
bade
them
general
grant
rested
his
hand
lightly
on
the
curly
head
and
said
gravely
berenice
be
sure
i
shall
not
forget
you
and
berry
smiled
up
at
the
serious
face
and
responded
i
wish
i
were
a
soldier
like
my
brother
francis
and
could
fight
in
your
army
general
after
the
last
sound
of
the
horses
feet
had
died
away
and
berry
had
ceased
to
exclaim
over
the
surprise
arnold
told
the
little
girl
more
fully
of
the
great
honor
that
had
befallen
her
general
grant
s
visit
was
wholly
for
you
berry
he
said
soberly
colonel
peabody
told
me
of
the
plan
on
the
day
of
my
visit
to
corinth
and
you
must
not
forget
the
honor
of
such
a
berry
nodded
silently
her
thoughts
drifted
back
to
the
night
when
in
shiloh
woods
she
crouched
listening
to
the
words
of
the
confederate
generals
planning
their
attack
on
grant
s
army
i
never
can
forget
it
she
responded
and
added
quickly
nor
the
battle
of
shiloh
father
or
anything
that
has
happened
this
winter
but
i
do
wish
we
could
go
home
to
well
my
dear
that
is
just
what
we
are
going
to
do
general
grant
has
given
us
passes
through
the
union
lines
and
within
a
few
weeks
we
will
start
replied
arnold
smilingly
oh
lor
w
ot
s
gwine
ter
become
ob
me
wailed
a
smothered
voice
close
at
hand
and
berry
turned
to
find
lily
with
her
apron
thrown
over
her
head
swaying
back
and
forth
on
the
path
you
will
go
with
us
of
course
berry
declared
and
arnold
promptly
repeated
her
words
of
course
and
instantly
lily
was
smiling
radiantly
but
mollie
bragg
heard
the
news
of
berry
s
departure
with
a
sad
heart
not
even
the
gifts
that
the
arnolds
bestowed
on
mollie
s
mother
could
comfort
the
little
mountain
girl
for
the
loss
of
the
only
playmate
she
had
ever
known
the
only
comfort
for
mollie
was
the
fact
that
berry
promised
to
write
to
her
from
vermont
and
you
can
write
to
me
mollie
berry
reminded
her
and
at
this
a
smile
crept
over
the
little
girl
s
face
yes
i
kin
she
responded
proudly
len
says
i
m
a
right
smart
and
sometime
i
ll
come
back
and
see
you
berry
promised
mollie
s
pale
eyes
brightened
oh
berry
i
hopes
you
will
come
back
she
said
eagerly
promise
you
and
again
berry
promised
but
it
was
many
years
before
the
little
yankee
girl
visited
the
cabin
on
the
ridge
beyond
the
battlefield
of
shiloh
and
fulfilled
the
promise
to
the
