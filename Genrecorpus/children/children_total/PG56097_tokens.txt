i
still
as
the
night
would
the
long
night
never
pass
a
figure
on
a
bed
in
a
big
bare
room
stirred
and
then
sighed
ages
ago
a
clock
in
the
great
house
known
as
primrose
hall
not
far
from
the
famous
region
of
sleepy
hollow
had
struck
three
then
four
and
now
one
two
three
four
five
solemn
strokes
boomed
forth
and
yet
not
a
glimmer
of
light
nor
a
sound
to
announce
the
coming
of
morning
in
the
lord
put
i
my
trust
how
say
ye
then
to
my
soul
that
she
should
flee
as
a
bird
unto
the
hill
for
lo
the
ungodly
bend
their
bow
and
make
ready
their
arrow
within
the
quiver
that
they
may
privily
shoot
at
them
which
are
true
of
heart
a
tired
voice
murmured
and
then
after
a
short
pause
oh
girls
are
you
awake
yet
aren
t
you
ever
ever
going
to
wake
up
dear
me
this
night
already
seems
to
me
to
have
lasted
forever
and
ever
for
no
answer
had
followed
the
question
although
a
door
stood
wide
open
between
this
and
an
adjoining
room
and
the
bed
in
the
other
room
was
occupied
by
two
persons
five
minutes
crawled
by
and
then
another
five
tired
of
reciting
the
psalms
of
david
to
induce
repose
the
wakeful
figure
slipped
suddenly
from
its
own
bed
and
a
slim
ghost
stole
across
the
ghost
that
even
in
the
darkness
revealed
two
shadowy
lengths
of
hair
in
the
farther
room
it
knelt
beside
another
bed
pressing
its
cheek
against
another
cheek
that
felt
both
plump
and
peaceful
while
its
hand
reached
forth
to
find
another
hand
that
lay
outside
the
coverlet
they
are
both
sound
asleep
and
i
am
a
wretch
to
be
trying
to
waken
them
the
spectre
faltered
but
how
can
they
sleep
so
soundly
the
first
night
at
a
strange
boarding
school
when
i
am
so
homesick
and
lonely
i
know
that
i
am
going
to
die
or
cry
or
do
something
else
desperate
if
only
jack
were
here
things
would
be
different
and
olive
ralston
one
of
the
four
girls
from
the
rainbow
ranch
sliding
to
the
floor
again
sat
with
her
legs
crossed
under
her
and
her
head
resting
on
her
hands
in
a
curious
indian
posture
of
grief
and
while
she
waited
watching
beside
the
bedside
where
jean
bruce
and
frieda
ralston
were
now
quietly
asleep
her
thoughts
wandered
away
to
the
hospital
in
new
york
city
which
held
her
beloved
friend
jack
only
the
day
before
the
three
ranch
girls
accompanied
by
their
chaperon
ruth
drew
had
made
their
initial
appearance
at
primrose
hall
to
begin
their
first
year
of
fashionable
boarding
school
life
but
once
the
girls
had
been
introduced
to
the
principal
of
the
school
miss
katherine
winthrop
and
ruth
had
had
a
talk
with
her
and
seen
the
rooms
assigned
to
the
ranch
girls
she
had
been
compelled
to
take
the
next
train
back
to
new
york
a
journey
of
twenty
or
more
miles
for
jack
had
been
left
behind
in
a
hospital
and
must
not
be
long
alone
there
she
lay
awaiting
the
verdict
of
the
new
york
surgeons
to
know
whether
after
her
accident
at
the
yellowstone
park
the
summer
before
she
might
ever
expect
to
walk
again
the
chief
reason
of
the
trip
from
the
rainbow
lodge
in
wyoming
to
new
york
city
had
not
been
to
give
the
ranch
girls
an
eastern
education
and
to
fit
them
for
a
more
cosmopolitan
life
now
that
so
great
wealth
was
being
brought
forth
from
the
rainbow
mine
but
to
find
out
what
could
be
done
for
jack
now
even
while
olive
was
thinking
of
her
best
loved
friend
a
faint
chirrupy
noise
and
a
flutter
of
unfolding
wings
sounded
along
the
outside
walls
of
primrose
hall
lifting
her
head
with
a
smothered
cry
of
delight
the
girl
spied
a
thin
streak
of
light
shining
across
the
floor
a
moment
later
back
in
her
own
room
with
the
door
closed
behind
her
and
her
own
window
open
her
eyes
were
soon
eagerly
scanning
the
unfamiliar
scene
before
her
dawn
had
come
at
last
the
young
girl
drew
a
deep
breath
in
the
excitement
of
her
arrival
at
school
the
day
before
in
the
first
meeting
with
so
many
strangers
olive
had
not
spared
time
to
see
or
think
of
the
surroundings
of
primrose
hall
but
now
she
could
examine
the
landscape
thoroughly
set
in
the
midst
of
one
of
the
most
beautiful
valleys
along
the
hudson
river
this
morning
the
fields
near
by
were
bright
with
blue
asters
with
goldenrod
and
the
white
blossoms
of
the
immortelles
the
low
hills
in
the
background
were
brown
and
red
and
gold
with
the
october
foliage
of
the
trees
beyond
the
fields
the
hudson
river
ran
broader
and
deeper
than
any
stream
of
water
a
ranch
girl
had
ever
seen
and
across
from
it
the
new
jersey
palisades
rose
like
hoary
battlements
now
veiled
in
a
light
fog
surely
no
sunrise
on
the
river
rhine
could
be
more
wonderful
than
this
sunrise
over
the
hudson
river
and
yet
as
olive
ralston
gazed
out
upon
it
its
beauty
did
not
dry
her
tears
nor
ease
the
lump
in
her
throat
for
what
she
wanted
was
home
the
old
familiar
sights
and
sounds
the
smell
of
the
rainbow
nothing
could
be
more
unlike
the
low
level
sweep
of
their
wyoming
prairie
than
this
hudson
river
country
heimweh
the
germans
call
this
yearning
for
home
which
we
have
named
homesickness
but
a
better
word
theirs
than
ours
for
surely
this
longing
for
home
for
accustomed
people
and
things
in
the
midst
of
strange
surroundings
may
be
a
woe
very
deep
and
intense
from
the
first
hour
of
the
ranch
girls
planning
to
come
east
to
boarding
school
olive
ralston
had
believed
that
the
change
from
the
simple
life
of
the
ranch
to
the
more
conventional
school
atmosphere
would
be
more
difficult
for
her
than
for
either
jean
or
frieda
true
she
had
not
spoken
of
it
but
olilie
whom
the
ranch
girls
had
renamed
olive
had
never
forgotten
that
she
was
in
reality
an
unknown
girl
with
no
name
of
her
own
and
no
people
and
except
for
her
friends
generosity
might
still
be
living
in
the
dirty
hut
in
the
indian
village
with
old
laska
after
talking
it
over
with
ruth
and
jack
they
had
all
decided
that
it
would
be
wiser
not
to
mention
olive
s
strange
history
to
her
new
schoolmates
now
in
the
midst
of
her
attack
of
homesickness
olive
wondered
if
the
girls
would
not
at
once
guess
her
mixed
blood
from
her
odd
appearance
or
else
might
she
not
some
day
betray
her
ignorance
of
the
little
manners
and
customs
that
reveal
a
good
family
and
good
breeding
in
the
two
happy
years
spent
at
the
rainbow
ranch
she
had
learned
all
she
could
from
ruth
and
the
other
three
girls
but
were
there
not
fourteen
other
ignorant
years
back
of
those
two
years
a
charming
picture
olive
made
standing
at
the
open
window
with
her
quaint
foreign
face
framed
in
the
high
colonial
casement
but
now
finding
both
the
autumn
air
and
her
own
thoughts
chilling
she
turned
away
and
began
slowly
to
dress
she
was
still
blue
and
yet
at
the
same
time
ashamed
of
herself
for
had
she
not
been
indulging
in
the
most
foolish
habit
in
the
world
feeling
sorry
for
herself
here
at
primrose
hall
did
she
not
hope
to
find
the
beginning
of
her
big
opportunity
and
have
not
big
opportunities
the
world
over
the
fashion
of
starting
out
with
difficulties
to
be
overcome
when
olive
s
education
was
completed
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
return
once
more
to
the
indian
village
where
she
had
spent
her
childhood
and
there
devote
her
life
to
the
teaching
of
the
indian
children
though
jack
and
frieda
ralston
since
the
discovery
of
the
gold
mine
near
rainbow
creek
were
probably
very
wealthy
and
though
it
was
but
right
that
jean
bruce
as
their
first
cousin
should
share
their
fortune
with
them
olive
did
not
feel
that
she
wished
to
be
always
dependent
even
on
the
best
of
friends
having
slowly
dressed
with
these
thoughts
in
her
mind
the
young
girl
s
mood
was
afterwards
a
little
more
cheerful
and
yet
she
could
not
make
up
her
mind
how
best
to
amuse
herself
until
the
seven
o
clock
bell
should
ring
for
breakfast
she
might
write
jack
of
course
but
there
was
no
news
to
tell
her
at
present
and
stirring
about
in
her
room
hanging
pictures
or
arranging
ornaments
would
surely
awaken
jean
and
frieda
who
were
still
slumbering
like
the
seven
famous
sleepers
no
other
girl
shared
olive
s
room
because
ruth
and
the
four
ranch
girls
hoped
that
after
a
few
weeks
treatment
in
the
new
york
hospital
jack
would
then
be
able
to
join
the
others
at
school
idling
about
and
uncertain
what
to
do
olive
came
again
to
her
open
window
and
there
stood
listening
to
the
chug
chug
chug
of
a
big
steamer
out
on
the
river
and
then
to
the
shriek
of
an
engine
along
its
banks
suddenly
her
face
brightened
what
a
goose
i
am
to
be
moping
indoors
she
exclaimed
aloud
i
think
i
will
try
jack
s
old
remedy
for
a
bad
temper
and
go
and
have
a
good
walk
to
myself
before
now
olive
did
not
have
the
least
idea
that
in
going
out
alone
and
without
permission
she
would
be
breaking
an
iron
law
of
primrose
hall
nothing
was
farther
from
her
mind
than
disobedience
but
no
one
had
yet
told
her
of
the
school
rules
and
regulations
and
taking
a
walk
alone
seemed
to
her
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
had
she
only
waited
a
few
hours
longer
she
must
have
understood
differently
for
the
students
were
expected
to
assemble
that
very
morning
to
hear
what
was
required
of
them
at
primrose
hall
as
quietly
as
possible
olive
now
slipped
on
her
coat
and
hat
creeping
along
the
hall
on
tiptoes
so
as
not
to
disturb
the
other
sleepers
and
for
the
same
reason
she
as
quietly
unlocked
the
big
front
door
but
once
out
on
the
lawn
so
innocent
was
she
of
trying
to
escape
unnoticed
that
she
paused
for
several
moments
to
gaze
back
at
the
great
house
she
was
about
to
leave
primrose
hall
was
so
handsome
and
imposing
that
its
new
pupil
felt
a
thrill
of
admiration
as
she
looked
upon
it
a
red
brick
mansion
of
the
old
colonial
period
it
was
set
in
a
lovely
garden
with
flowers
and
shrubs
growing
close
about
the
house
and
an
avenue
of
elm
trees
leading
down
to
the
gate
back
of
the
house
was
an
english
garden
with
a
border
of
box
and
a
at
the
end
of
a
long
path
this
morning
only
a
few
late
asters
were
in
bloom
in
the
garden
and
bushes
of
hardy
hydrangeas
with
their
great
blossoms
now
turning
rose
and
brown
from
the
first
early
autumn
frosts
the
house
and
estate
of
twelve
acres
had
belonged
in
the
family
of
miss
katherine
winthrop
for
the
past
five
generations
and
olive
smiled
a
little
over
her
queer
conceit
for
the
house
somehow
suggested
its
present
owner
to
her
surely
miss
winthrop
had
appeared
just
as
imposing
and
aristocratic
as
her
old
home
on
first
meeting
with
her
the
day
before
but
far
colder
and
more
imposing
than
any
mere
pile
of
brick
and
stone
primrose
hall
was
of
so
great
size
that
it
included
all
the
bedrooms
and
reception
rooms
necessary
for
its
pupils
and
teachers
and
the
only
other
school
buildings
about
the
grounds
were
the
recitation
hall
and
two
sorority
houses
devoted
to
the
pleasures
of
the
girls
olive
had
never
heard
of
secret
societies
yet
she
wondered
what
the
mystic
words
kappa
and
theta
meant
inscribed
above
their
doors
primrose
hall
had
been
recommended
to
ruth
drew
and
the
ranch
girls
by
peter
drummond
the
new
york
friend
whom
they
had
learned
to
know
at
the
yellowstone
park
but
apart
from
its
excellent
reputation
as
a
finishing
school
their
choice
had
fallen
upon
it
because
of
the
beauty
of
its
historic
grounds
in
this
same
old
house
washington
and
lafayette
had
been
known
to
stay
and
who
can
guess
how
many
powdered
belles
and
beaus
may
have
flirted
with
one
another
in
the
garden
by
the
old
when
olive
had
grown
tired
of
the
views
about
the
houses
she
determined
to
extend
her
walk
over
a
portion
of
the
estate
and
coming
to
a
low
stone
wall
climbed
over
it
without
thinking
or
caring
just
where
it
led
her
being
outdoors
once
more
and
free
to
wander
as
she
choose
after
two
weeks
confinement
one
aboard
a
stuffy
train
and
the
other
in
a
hotel
in
new
york
was
now
so
inspiring
that
olive
felt
like
singing
aloud
indeed
it
seemed
to
her
that
her
own
personality
which
had
somehow
vanished
since
leaving
the
ranch
had
come
back
to
her
this
morning
like
a
dear
familiar
garment
it
was
as
though
she
had
lately
been
wearing
fine
clothes
that
did
not
belong
to
her
and
in
this
hour
had
donned
once
again
her
own
dress
running
along
with
the
fleetness
and
quietness
of
her
early
indian
days
soon
the
truant
found
herself
in
a
woods
thick
with
underbrush
and
trees
never
seen
before
by
a
wyoming
girl
the
air
was
delicious
the
leaves
sparkled
with
the
melting
of
the
frost
there
was
a
splendid
new
wine
of
youth
and
romance
abroad
in
the
world
and
olive
completely
forgot
that
she
was
in
the
midst
of
a
highly
civilized
community
and
not
in
the
heart
of
a
virgin
forest
indeed
it
was
not
until
she
had
come
entirely
out
of
the
woods
that
her
awakening
took
place
then
she
found
herself
apparently
in
some
one
s
private
yard
for
she
stood
facing
a
white
house
set
up
on
a
hill
with
a
tower
at
the
top
of
it
and
queer
gabled
windows
on
either
side
at
the
entrance
to
its
big
front
door
stood
two
absurd
iron
dogs
and
yet
there
was
nothing
in
any
of
these
ordinary
details
to
make
the
onlooker
turn
crimson
and
then
pale
and
yet
as
she
stared
up
at
the
house
the
idea
that
had
suddenly
come
to
her
seemed
so
utterly
so
absurdly
impossible
that
surely
she
must
be
losing
her
senses
for
five
minutes
olive
waited
without
taking
her
gaze
from
the
house
and
then
with
a
shrug
of
her
shoulders
turned
and
walked
back
into
the
woods
at
first
she
paid
no
particular
attention
to
what
direction
she
was
taking
until
all
at
once
hearing
footsteps
not
far
behind
she
felt
reasonably
sure
they
were
following
hers
chapter
ii
in
disgrace
it
was
ridiculous
for
olive
to
have
been
so
frightened
with
so
slight
cause
yet
the
thought
that
some
one
might
be
in
pursuit
of
her
filled
her
with
a
nervous
terror
to
the
people
not
afflicted
with
timidity
most
fears
are
ridiculous
and
yet
no
single
weakness
is
harder
to
overcome
of
the
four
ranch
girls
olive
was
the
only
timid
one
but
before
one
criticizes
her
remember
her
childhood
now
with
her
heart
pounding
and
her
breath
coming
in
short
gasps
she
quickened
her
pace
into
a
run
recalling
at
the
same
time
their
chaperon
s
forgotten
instruction
that
she
must
no
longer
expect
the
happy
freedom
of
their
western
lands
but
the
faster
the
frightened
girl
ran
the
faster
the
traveler
back
of
her
appeared
to
be
following
and
now
olive
dared
not
hide
deeper
in
the
woods
knowing
that
the
hour
was
growing
late
and
that
any
added
delay
would
make
her
late
for
breakfast
many
times
in
her
life
would
her
indian
knowledge
of
the
woods
save
her
in
emergencies
of
this
sort
so
in
another
moment
she
remembered
that
an
indian
never
runs
away
from
his
pursuer
but
hides
until
his
enemy
has
passed
behind
a
low
clump
of
laurel
bushes
the
girl
hid
herself
crouching
low
and
expecting
each
instant
to
see
a
tramp
or
an
armed
gamekeeper
whose
business
it
was
to
keep
intruders
out
of
private
property
savagely
on
the
lookout
for
her
her
pursuer
did
come
on
without
hesitation
and
finally
arrived
just
opposite
olive
s
hiding
place
but
then
it
was
the
girl
in
hiding
who
suddenly
sprang
to
her
feet
startling
the
newcomer
for
the
enemy
she
had
so
dreaded
was
only
another
girl
like
herself
with
a
smile
on
her
face
and
a
bundle
of
books
under
her
arm
she
was
ten
years
older
perhaps
yet
she
looked
not
unlike
jacqueline
ralston
before
her
illness
her
eyes
were
blue
instead
of
gray
but
she
had
the
same
bright
bronze
hair
and
firm
line
to
her
chin
and
the
same
proud
way
of
holding
up
her
head
who
or
what
are
you
she
asked
olive
a
wood
nymph
living
in
this
underbrush
for
your
clothes
are
of
so
nearly
the
same
color
that
i
did
not
see
you
at
olive
who
was
wearing
a
dark
coat
suit
and
a
of
velvet
of
the
same
shade
shook
her
head
i
am
one
of
the
new
girls
from
primrose
hall
and
i
have
been
out
for
a
walk
but
as
i
am
not
very
familiar
with
these
woods
i
am
not
just
sure
where
i
am
would
you
her
request
came
to
an
abrupt
end
because
of
the
expression
of
surprise
and
disapproval
on
the
older
girl
s
face
a
student
from
primrose
hall
and
outdoors
alone
at
this
hour
of
the
morning
how
on
earth
did
miss
winthrop
happen
to
give
you
permission
she
asked
in
the
positive
fashion
that
olive
was
to
learn
to
know
so
well
later
on
the
first
consciousness
of
possible
now
swept
over
the
truant
could
it
be
that
in
taking
a
walk
without
asking
permission
she
had
broken
a
rule
of
her
new
school
the
idea
seemed
ridiculous
to
olive
and
not
all
things
different
than
in
the
old
days
i
am
so
sorry
but
no
one
gave
me
permission
to
take
a
walk
was
it
necessary
to
ask
she
inquired
you
see
we
only
arrived
at
primrose
hall
yesterday
and
we
often
stay
out
hours
before
breakfast
at
home
riding
over
the
plains
olive
s
innocence
of
offense
and
her
distress
were
so
plain
to
the
older
girl
that
straightway
she
slipped
her
arm
through
hers
and
without
delay
hurried
her
along
toward
school
talking
as
she
went
i
am
jessica
hunt
the
teacher
of
english
and
elocution
at
primrose
hall
and
i
have
been
spending
the
night
with
some
jessica
gave
a
reassuring
pressure
to
the
hand
in
hers
you
must
not
be
frightened
child
if
miss
winthrop
seems
rather
terrifying
on
your
return
i
used
to
be
a
pupil
at
primrose
hall
before
i
started
in
with
the
teaching
and
i
m
really
very
fond
of
her
miss
winthrop
isn
t
so
severe
as
she
looks
but
i
expect
i
had
better
tell
you
that
it
is
after
breakfast
time
now
and
as
the
school
girls
are
never
allowed
to
go
out
alone
and
never
without
permission
why
she
may
scold
you
a
if
only
she
might
at
this
moment
have
dropped
down
in
the
path
to
weep
like
a
naughty
child
about
to
be
punished
for
a
fault
olive
would
have
felt
it
a
great
relief
and
only
the
thought
of
her
age
prevented
her
doing
this
could
she
ever
live
through
the
embarrassment
of
facing
fifty
strange
girls
more
than
half
a
dozen
teachers
and
miss
winthrop
while
she
was
being
reprimanded
why
yesterday
just
on
being
introduced
to
miss
winthrop
with
ruth
and
jean
and
frieda
with
her
for
protection
had
she
not
felt
as
and
frightened
as
a
silly
baby
and
now
must
she
face
this
stern
woman
alone
and
under
the
shadow
of
her
displeasure
never
as
long
as
she
lived
and
the
circumstances
of
olive
ralston
s
life
were
always
unusual
and
romantic
would
she
ever
forget
the
next
half
hour
s
experience
at
primrose
hall
nor
the
appearance
of
the
great
hall
as
she
entered
it
with
girls
and
teachers
grouped
about
and
towering
above
everything
and
everybody
the
tall
commanding
presence
of
its
principal
miss
katherine
winthrop
almost
without
her
own
volition
olive
found
herself
standing
in
front
of
miss
winthrop
jessica
s
arm
still
through
hers
heard
the
teacher
of
mathematics
say
here
is
your
new
runaway
pupil
with
miss
hunt
and
realized
that
this
teacher
whom
she
had
disliked
yesterday
because
she
wore
round
spectacles
and
dressed
like
a
man
wished
not
so
much
to
get
her
into
trouble
as
to
involve
jessica
in
her
disgrace
but
jessica
was
not
in
the
least
disturbed
being
the
only
teacher
at
primrose
hall
not
afraid
of
its
owner
miss
winthrop
she
now
began
coaxingly
i
have
brought
our
new
girl
home
she
was
only
taking
a
walk
in
the
woods
near
by
but
i
am
sure
she
would
rather
explain
to
you
herself
that
in
going
out
without
permission
she
did
not
know
she
was
breaking
a
school
rule
you
see
she
has
lived
always
in
the
west
and
been
accustomed
to
such
perfect
jessica
was
continuing
her
case
for
the
defendant
realizing
that
olive
was
still
too
frightened
to
speak
for
herself
but
suddenly
miss
hunt
was
thrust
aside
by
a
small
plump
person
with
the
longest
yellow
braids
and
the
biggest
blue
eyes
in
the
school
and
without
the
least
regard
for
either
teachers
or
principal
frieda
ralston
now
flung
her
arms
about
olive
for
goodness
sake
why
didn
t
you
tell
jean
and
me
where
you
were
going
she
demanded
we
have
been
so
frightened
about
and
then
before
olive
could
reply
another
girl
stood
at
her
other
side
a
girl
with
dark
brown
hair
a
pale
skin
and
demure
brown
eyes
whose
nose
had
the
faintest
most
delicious
tilt
at
the
end
of
it
jean
bruce
said
nothing
but
she
looked
ready
and
anxious
to
defend
her
friend
against
all
the
world
surrounding
the
little
group
of
ranch
girls
and
the
three
teachers
were
numbers
of
other
students
most
of
whom
were
casting
glances
of
sympathy
at
the
new
pupil
who
had
so
soon
fallen
into
disgrace
breakfast
just
over
they
were
supposedly
on
their
way
upstairs
to
their
own
rooms
but
olive
s
entrance
with
jessica
had
interrupted
them
and
until
miss
winthrop
spoke
no
one
had
stirred
you
may
go
to
your
own
apartments
now
girls
she
said
quietly
miss
ralston
will
explain
her
absence
to
me
in
my
private
as
her
words
and
look
included
jean
and
frieda
they
also
were
compelled
to
follow
the
other
students
up
the
broad
mahogany
stairs
leaving
olive
to
face
her
fate
alone
only
one
girl
with
short
curly
hair
and
a
freckled
nose
actually
had
the
courage
to
stop
in
passing
and
whisper
to
the
offender
fare
thee
well
light
of
my
life
farewell
for
crimes
unknown
you
go
to
a
dungeon
cell
she
chanted
then
while
olive
was
trying
to
summon
a
smile
in
return
a
beautiful
girl
with
pale
blonde
hair
joined
both
of
them
and
drawing
the
other
girl
away
said
loud
enough
for
a
dozen
persons
near
by
to
overhear
oh
do
come
on
upstairs
gerry
when
will
you
learn
not
to
be
friendly
to
objectionable
persons
whom
no
one
knows
anything
about
and
so
cool
and
indifferent
did
her
expression
appear
as
she
made
her
unkind
speech
that
it
was
hard
to
believe
she
understood
that
her
words
could
be
overheard
but
olive
ralston
heard
them
and
in
spite
of
her
gentleness
never
in
after
years
forgot
or
forgave
them
a
minute
or
so
later
when
everybody
else
had
disappeared
olive
found
herself
alone
in
miss
winthrop
s
study
seated
in
a
comfortable
leather
chair
facing
a
desk
at
which
miss
winthrop
was
writing
i
will
talk
to
you
in
a
few
minutes
she
had
said
as
they
entered
the
room
and
at
first
the
prisoner
had
felt
that
waiting
to
hear
her
sentence
would
be
unendurable
of
course
she
would
be
expelled
from
primrose
hall
olive
had
no
other
idea
and
of
course
ruth
and
jack
would
understand
and
forgive
her
but
there
would
be
no
going
back
on
her
part
to
be
a
burden
and
disgrace
to
them
somehow
she
must
find
work
to
support
herself
in
the
future
but
as
time
passed
on
and
miss
winthrop
continued
with
her
writing
by
and
by
olive
s
attention
wandered
from
her
own
sorrows
and
she
busied
herself
in
studying
her
judge
s
face
miss
winthrop
s
expression
was
not
so
stern
in
repose
for
though
the
lines
about
her
mouth
were
severe
and
her
nose
aquiline
her
forehead
was
high
and
broad
and
her
dark
eyes
full
of
dignity
and
purpose
and
then
her
figure
olive
felt
obliged
to
admit
that
though
she
was
taller
and
larger
than
almost
any
woman
she
had
known
her
grace
and
dignity
were
most
unusual
and
the
severity
of
her
simple
black
silk
gown
showed
her
to
great
advantage
weary
of
scrutinizing
the
older
woman
olive
s
eyes
next
traveled
idly
to
the
top
of
miss
winthrop
s
desk
resting
there
for
an
eager
moment
while
in
her
interest
she
forgot
everything
else
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
this
young
girl
who
had
seen
nothing
of
the
world
of
art
had
her
attention
arrested
by
one
of
the
world
s
great
masterpieces
on
miss
winthrop
s
desk
there
stood
a
cast
of
an
heroic
figure
of
a
woman
with
broad
beautiful
shoulders
and
wonderful
flowing
draperies
the
figure
was
without
head
or
arms
and
yet
was
so
inspiring
that
without
realizing
it
olive
gave
a
sigh
of
delight
straightway
miss
winthrop
glanced
up
you
like
my
cast
she
asked
quickly
do
you
know
that
it
is
a
copy
of
the
statue
of
the
winged
victory
the
nike
the
real
statue
now
stands
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
in
the
louvre
in
paris
and
there
you
will
probably
see
it
some
day
but
i
like
to
keep
the
figure
here
as
a
kind
of
inspiration
to
me
and
to
my
girls
for
to
me
the
victory
means
so
much
more
than
the
statue
of
a
woman
it
stands
i
think
as
the
emblem
of
the
superwoman
what
all
we
women
must
hope
to
be
some
day
see
the
beauty
and
dignity
of
her
as
though
she
had
turned
her
back
on
all
sin
and
injustice
and
was
moving
forward
into
a
new
world
of
light
i
like
to
believe
that
the
splendid
lost
arms
of
the
nike
carried
the
world
s
children
in
of
course
miss
winthrop
realized
that
she
was
talking
above
the
head
of
her
new
pupil
but
she
wished
an
opportunity
to
study
the
girl
s
face
now
she
saw
by
its
sudden
glow
and
softening
that
she
had
caught
at
least
a
measure
of
her
meaning
girls
girls
sometimes
miss
winthrop
felt
that
the
world
held
nothing
else
and
that
she
knew
all
the
varieties
and
yet
one
could
never
be
too
sure
for
here
before
her
was
a
new
type
unlike
all
the
others
and
for
some
reason
at
this
moment
she
attracted
her
strongly
to
miss
winthrop
alone
at
primrose
hall
ruth
drew
had
thought
it
wise
to
confide
as
much
as
they
knew
of
olive
s
extraordinary
history
pledging
her
to
secrecy
now
to
herself
miss
winthrop
said
it
is
utterly
ridiculous
to
believe
this
child
has
indian
blood
for
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
her
appearance
to
indicate
it
i
believe
that
her
history
is
far
more
curious
than
her
friends
but
to
olive
of
course
she
said
nothing
of
this
for
after
her
first
speech
her
manner
appeared
to
change
entirely
sitting
very
erect
in
her
chair
she
turned
upon
her
pupil
you
may
go
she
said
coldly
for
i
understand
that
by
your
action
this
morning
you
did
not
deliberately
intend
to
break
one
of
my
rules
but
kindly
be
more
careful
in
the
future
for
i
am
not
accustomed
to
overlooking
disobedience
whatever
its
with
a
sigh
of
relief
olive
straightway
fled
into
the
hall
wondering
if
she
could
ever
like
this
miss
winthrop
who
could
be
so
stern
one
moment
and
so
interesting
the
next
for
her
own
part
olive
felt
that
she
much
preferred
their
former
chaperon
ruth
drew
for
if
ruth
were
less
handsome
and
perhaps
not
so
cultivated
she
was
at
least
more
human
if
only
they
were
all
back
at
the
rainbow
ranch
with
ruth
to
scold
and
pet
them
for
their
misdoings
all
in
the
same
breath
chapter
iii
gerry
the
three
ranch
girls
had
their
set
of
apartments
toward
the
front
of
the
house
on
the
second
floor
at
primrose
hall
so
in
order
for
olive
to
reach
her
room
it
was
necessary
that
she
should
pass
along
a
long
corridor
into
which
various
other
apartments
opened
she
was
not
interested
in
anything
but
the
one
thought
of
finding
frieda
and
jean
and
yet
hurrying
by
an
open
door
she
was
obliged
to
overhear
a
conversation
between
two
girls
who
were
talking
in
rather
loud
tones
i
don
t
care
winifred
graham
whether
you
like
it
or
not
one
of
the
voices
asserted
but
i
certainly
intend
to
be
as
nice
to
these
new
western
girls
as
i
know
how
they
are
strangers
and
i
think
it
horrid
to
try
to
snub
them
just
because
you
think
perhaps
they
are
not
so
rich
and
fashionable
as
the
rest
of
the
primrose
girls
i
suppose
you
will
try
to
turn
as
many
of
the
other
juniors
against
them
as
you
can
twist
around
your
finger
but
kindly
don
t
include
me
in
your
list
perhaps
you
think
i
don
t
know
why
you
have
had
me
for
one
of
your
chums
for
so
long
goodness
child
i
am
not
so
foolish
as
i
look
it
is
because
i
am
homely
as
a
mud
fence
so
when
i
m
around
you
re
more
the
stately
beauty
than
ever
in
contrast
with
poor
little
me
but
maybe
you
won
t
always
be
thought
the
prettiest
girl
in
the
school
for
this
queer
looking
olive
what
s
her
name
is
as
good
looking
as
you
are
in
an
odd
foreign
way
and
the
one
named
jean
bruce
goes
you
a
close
second
if
you
are
angry
with
me
why
you
need
not
have
me
for
a
roommate
for
i
am
going
this
very
second
to
call
on
the
new
ranch
girls
and
welcome
them
to
primrose
and
with
a
flounce
the
same
girl
who
had
stopped
to
tease
olive
earlier
that
morning
now
ran
along
the
hall
after
her
slipping
her
arm
through
hers
in
the
friendliest
of
fashions
please
m
may
i
come
and
make
you
a
call
she
inquired
for
i
have
been
several
years
at
primrose
hall
and
know
the
place
like
an
old
shoe
besides
i
think
that
you
and
the
older
one
of
your
sisters
or
friends
i
can
t
guess
your
relation
must
be
going
to
be
in
our
junior
class
and
i
tell
you
we
juniors
have
to
stick
close
together
these
by
this
time
the
two
girls
had
arrived
before
olive
s
door
but
hearing
queer
noises
in
another
room
they
followed
the
sounds
discovering
jean
and
frieda
in
the
adjoining
chamber
which
was
to
be
the
ranch
girls
sitting
room
an
immediate
introduction
was
difficult
because
both
jean
and
frieda
were
apparently
standing
on
their
heads
inside
the
trunk
of
their
indian
curios
they
were
not
alone
for
two
sisters
mollie
and
lucy
johnson
from
across
the
hall
had
come
in
to
lend
them
hammer
and
nails
and
were
now
watching
them
with
deep
absorption
jean
frieda
olive
exclaimed
this
and
then
she
stopped
in
some
confusion
remembering
that
she
had
not
yet
heard
their
new
friend
s
name
the
two
ranch
girls
came
forth
from
the
trunk
in
time
to
see
their
new
visitor
smiling
at
them
i
am
geraldine
ferrows
at
your
service
she
explained
but
i
m
better
known
to
the
world
as
gerry
see
i
have
brought
your
olive
safe
back
from
the
lion
s
den
and
as
she
is
no
more
eaten
up
than
was
the
prophet
daniel
why
it
proves
that
she
s
a
saint
to
start
with
i
wonder
if
you
would
care
to
have
me
tell
you
about
primrose
hall
and
what
we
are
expected
to
do
and
what
not
to
do
olive
frieda
and
mollie
and
lucy
johnson
nodded
thankfully
but
jean
closed
her
lips
and
hardly
appeared
to
have
heard
the
question
she
was
not
accustomed
to
feeling
out
of
things
as
she
had
this
morning
and
was
not
sure
she
cared
to
have
strangers
making
an
effort
to
be
kind
suppose
this
geraldine
ferrows
was
one
of
the
old
students
and
said
to
be
one
of
the
cleverest
if
not
the
cleverest
of
the
girls
well
even
that
gave
her
no
right
to
be
patronizing
to
them
but
gerry
apparently
not
observing
jean
s
unfriendliness
and
having
already
taken
a
fancy
to
her
as
strangers
usually
did
now
seated
herself
on
the
floor
beckoning
to
the
others
to
follow
suit
all
gaul
my
children
is
divided
into
three
parts
as
we
learn
in
our
latin
book
she
said
gayly
but
primrose
hall
i
regret
to
say
is
divided
into
only
two
parts
the
girls
winifred
graham
likes
and
the
girls
she
docs
not
i
used
to
belong
to
the
first
class
but
now
i
probably
belong
to
the
second
i
was
kind
of
in
love
with
winifred
last
year
and
let
her
boss
me
around
but
during
the
summer
i
thought
things
over
and
decided
to
strike
when
she
was
so
horrid
to
a
stranger
this
morning
it
seemed
to
me
the
time
was
ripe
she
won
t
care
a
snap
about
my
desertion
for
she
never
cares
for
people
unless
they
are
rich
and
i
m
not
a
bit
only
my
father
is
a
famous
surgeon
in
new
york
and
i
m
going
to
be
a
doctor
myself
some
day
since
i
m
too
homely
for
any
kind
gentleman
to
marry
i
suppose
it
is
because
winifred
thought
you
girls
didn
t
look
rich
and
instantly
gerry
bit
her
lively
tongue
pretending
not
to
be
able
to
say
anything
more
although
jean
was
gazing
at
her
in
a
more
encouraging
fashion
than
she
had
worn
at
the
beginning
of
her
speech
all
the
way
across
the
continent
from
wyoming
to
new
york
city
the
four
ranch
girls
ruth
and
their
english
friend
frank
kent
had
discussed
this
question
should
the
girls
on
arriving
at
boarding
school
speak
of
their
gold
mine
to
their
new
acquaintances
ruth
and
jack
advised
against
it
olive
had
no
pronounced
opinion
frieda
and
frank
thought
they
might
as
well
mention
it
now
and
then
while
jean
was
determined
to
speak
of
their
gold
mine
whenever
the
chance
offered
and
to
make
the
biggest
impression
she
possibly
could
so
now
it
was
surprising
to
hear
jean
say
with
a
slight
flush
in
the
healthy
pallor
of
her
clear
skin
no
we
wouldn
t
wish
any
one
at
primrose
hall
to
care
for
us
because
of
our
lack
of
it
she
answered
demurely
so
i
am
afraid
miss
graham
and
her
friends
will
not
like
us
any
too
well
you
see
we
are
simply
ranch
girls
and
will
have
to
stand
or
fall
by
that
i
suppose
this
miss
graham
decided
that
we
were
poor
because
our
clothes
are
so
simple
and
we
haven
t
thirteen
trunks
apiece
as
most
of
the
girls
here
have
olive
and
i
were
laughing
yesterday
because
on
our
arrival
we
were
given
united
states
lock
boxes
for
our
jewels
jewels
why
we
haven
t
any
except
a
few
trinkets
and
two
or
three
keepsakes
that
belong
to
olive
and
jean
frowned
and
shook
her
head
warningly
at
frieda
whose
eyes
were
bigger
and
bluer
than
ever
and
whose
lips
were
about
to
form
the
name
of
the
rainbow
mine
jumping
up
in
order
to
divert
her
attention
jean
ran
across
to
their
trunk
of
indian
relics
and
diving
down
into
it
again
came
forth
with
three
pretty
indian
baskets
won
t
each
one
of
you
take
one
of
these
baskets
to
remind
you
that
you
were
our
first
callers
at
primrose
hall
and
we
hope
our
first
friends
she
said
prettily
handing
a
basket
to
gerry
and
then
the
others
to
the
two
sisters
but
all
the
while
jean
was
talking
and
acting
this
little
pantomime
inside
of
her
something
kept
repeating
jack
was
right
and
we
don
t
want
to
be
liked
for
our
money
we
will
find
out
who
the
really
nice
girls
are
at
primrose
hall
and
well
it
was
comfortable
to
recall
that
in
jim
s
last
letter
written
after
they
had
left
the
ranch
he
had
said
the
pot
of
gold
from
the
end
of
their
rainbow
mine
had
yielded
five
thousand
dollars
within
the
month
just
past
and
that
there
appeared
to
be
plenty
more
gold
where
that
had
come
from
suddenly
a
great
bell
sounded
close
by
and
five
girls
started
with
surprise
only
geraldine
ferrows
remaining
perfectly
calm
getting
up
from
the
floor
however
she
stuck
her
indian
basket
on
her
head
for
a
hat
using
the
handle
as
a
strap
tidy
your
hair
young
women
and
come
along
over
to
the
recitation
hall
that
was
not
an
alarm
of
fire
that
just
sounded
only
a
gentle
reminder
that
we
are
to
assemble
within
the
next
ten
minutes
to
meet
our
teachers
and
to
get
ready
our
schedules
of
work
for
the
next
quarter
i
can
only
hope
that
all
of
you
are
as
wise
as
you
are
beautiful
for
primrose
hall
is
no
gerry
was
marching
out
of
the
room
to
the
tune
of
tommy
atkins
when
jean
called
after
her
you
were
awfully
good
to
come
in
to
see
us
and
we
are
obliged
to
you
so
please
help
us
out
whenever
you
can
i
am
afraid
that
the
things
we
know
such
as
riding
bareback
and
raising
cattle
and
shooting
straight
won
t
be
considered
accomplishments
at
boarding
and
jean
looked
unusually
humble
and
particularly
pretty
gerry
laughed
don
t
worry
we
are
none
too
learned
ourselves
at
primrose
hall
for
we
keep
all
varieties
of
insects
here
butterflies
as
well
as
bookworms
but
i
will
say
for
miss
winthrop
that
though
this
is
a
fashionable
school
she
does
try
to
make
us
mind
our
q
s
as
well
as
our
p
frieda
was
never
born
to
understand
a
joke
please
what
does
it
mean
to
mind
our
p
s
and
q
s
she
inquired
solemnly
oh
p
s
stand
for
parties
and
politeness
and
primping
and
how
to
enter
a
room
and
what
to
say
when
you
get
there
and
all
the
things
that
mean
society
with
a
big
s
miss
frieda
ralston
gerry
returned
but
q
s
q
s
are
dreadful
things
called
quizzes
and
you
will
pretty
soon
find
out
what
quizzing
means
particularly
if
you
happen
to
be
in
the
mathematics
class
taught
by
the
female
who
rejoices
in
the
delicious
name
of
miss
rebecca
sterne
but
really
frieda
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
about
the
meaning
of
the
old
expression
mind
your
p
s
and
q
s
the
century
dictionary
tells
us
that
the
expression
alluded
to
the
difficulty
in
the
early
days
of
discerning
the
difference
between
the
two
and
with
this
last
bit
of
wisdom
and
a
shake
of
her
curly
head
gerry
really
vanished
from
the
ranch
girls
room
chapter
iv
getting
into
harness
two
weeks
had
elapsed
since
the
arrival
of
the
three
ranch
girls
at
boarding
school
and
so
many
changes
appeared
to
have
taken
place
in
their
lives
that
already
the
weeks
seemed
as
many
months
one
of
the
changes
they
themselves
did
not
realize
but
nevertheless
it
was
a
serious
one
for
jean
frieda
and
olive
were
no
longer
so
intimate
as
they
had
been
in
the
old
days
at
rainbow
lodge
each
girl
was
going
her
own
way
keeping
her
own
confidence
forming
new
friendships
and
apparently
forgetting
the
importance
of
past
ties
and
of
the
three
girls
it
was
frieda
who
had
become
the
most
emancipated
having
conceived
a
tremendous
devotion
for
mollie
johnson
the
two
girls
were
rarely
apart
lucy
johnson
was
a
good
deal
older
than
frieda
but
mollie
was
a
year
younger
than
the
youngest
miss
ralston
and
looked
up
to
her
as
the
most
wonderful
person
in
the
world
insisting
that
the
stories
frieda
told
of
her
life
on
the
ranch
made
her
appear
like
a
heroine
in
a
book
now
frieda
was
tired
of
being
treated
like
a
baby
by
her
family
and
besides
as
no
one
had
ever
told
her
before
that
she
was
in
the
least
like
a
heroine
she
found
the
idea
distinctly
pleasant
the
two
johnson
sisters
were
from
richmond
virginia
and
had
vivacious
manners
and
soft
southern
voices
mollie
was
small
and
dark
and
fluttered
about
like
a
little
brown
bird
such
a
complete
contrast
to
frieda
s
fairness
and
slow
movements
that
it
was
small
wonder
the
two
girls
were
drawn
together
by
their
very
unlikeness
and
that
already
their
schoolmates
were
calling
them
the
siamese
twins
because
they
went
everywhere
together
with
their
arms
locked
about
one
another
wore
one
another
s
clothes
when
their
different
sizes
permitted
and
were
never
without
true
lover
s
knots
of
blue
ribbon
tied
in
their
buttonholes
knots
made
from
a
sacrificial
division
of
all
frieda
s
best
hair
ribbons
not
that
hair
ribbons
interested
their
owner
any
further
for
the
fifth
day
after
frieda
s
arrival
at
boarding
school
and
in
spite
of
jean
s
and
olive
s
objections
her
long
braids
had
disappeared
and
in
their
place
a
pysche
knot
of
huge
proportions
could
be
seen
at
the
back
of
her
head
the
psyche
knot
was
not
becoming
because
its
wearer
did
not
have
a
greek
face
but
it
was
grown
up
and
the
latest
fashion
and
of
course
nothing
else
really
matters
as
frieda
s
school
work
was
not
the
same
as
jean
s
and
olive
s
on
account
of
her
age
and
the
fact
that
she
never
had
cared
much
about
books
the
division
of
her
time
was
different
from
theirs
so
perhaps
it
was
but
natural
that
in
the
excitement
of
her
first
independence
and
without
jack
s
influence
she
should
be
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
ganging
her
own
but
with
jean
bruce
the
change
was
even
more
subtle
and
more
unconscious
why
jean
and
olive
had
actually
laughed
together
over
frieda
s
desertion
of
them
and
all
the
while
they
were
laughing
though
she
had
said
nothing
olive
was
wondering
if
jean
did
not
know
that
she
saw
almost
as
little
of
her
as
she
did
of
frieda
these
days
without
realizing
it
or
having
made
any
special
effort
jean
bruce
two
weeks
after
her
arrival
at
primrose
hall
was
one
of
the
most
popular
girls
in
the
school
as
a
proof
of
it
she
had
already
been
invited
to
join
both
the
two
sororities
and
had
not
made
up
her
mind
which
one
she
should
choose
the
fact
that
winifred
graham
belonged
to
the
kappa
sorority
certainly
influenced
jean
in
the
direction
of
the
theta
for
from
the
hour
of
geraldine
ferrows
revelation
of
winifred
s
character
there
had
been
open
war
between
winifred
and
jean
of
course
winifred
s
rudeness
to
olive
was
the
first
cause
of
jean
s
offense
but
now
olive
was
almost
forgotten
and
overlooked
in
their
personal
rivalry
it
was
an
open
discussion
that
the
choice
for
junior
class
president
which
must
be
made
before
the
christmas
holidays
would
lie
between
these
two
girls
for
though
jean
had
continued
her
masquerade
of
poverty
the
best
girls
in
the
school
had
not
been
influenced
by
it
indeed
jean
s
closest
friend
margaret
belknap
belonged
to
one
of
the
oldest
and
wealthiest
families
in
new
york
city
people
who
looked
down
upon
the
four
hundred
as
belonging
to
the
dreadful
new
but
while
school
life
was
apparently
moving
so
pleasantly
for
jean
and
frieda
olive
for
some
unexplained
reason
was
making
no
friends
though
it
was
customary
to
invite
the
new
girls
at
primrose
hall
into
one
or
the
other
of
the
secret
societies
almost
immediately
upon
their
arrival
at
school
olive
had
not
yet
been
chosen
for
either
sorority
too
shy
and
sensitive
to
mention
it
even
to
her
best
friends
she
did
not
dream
that
jean
was
unaware
of
the
slights
put
upon
her
only
in
secret
olive
suffered
tortures
wondering
if
her
blood
showed
itself
so
plainly
that
her
classmates
disliked
her
for
that
reason
or
if
she
were
more
unattractive
than
all
other
girls
still
her
beloved
jack
who
was
finer
and
more
beautiful
than
anybody
in
the
world
had
cared
for
her
and
if
only
the
doctors
would
say
that
jack
was
strong
enough
to
join
them
at
primrose
hall
nothing
else
would
make
any
difference
letters
from
ruth
drew
and
now
and
then
one
from
peter
drummond
had
assured
the
girls
that
jack
was
doing
as
well
as
could
be
expected
but
as
yet
there
had
been
no
definite
report
from
the
surgeon
however
if
olive
ralston
had
so
far
made
no
friends
among
her
classmates
there
were
other
persons
in
the
school
interested
in
her
who
were
more
important
among
them
was
jessica
hunt
the
young
teacher
whom
olive
had
met
on
the
morning
of
her
unfortunate
walk
there
was
something
in
the
strange
girl
s
shyness
and
gentle
dignity
that
made
a
strong
appeal
to
jessica
and
though
she
had
so
far
no
opportunity
to
reveal
her
friendliness
she
had
noticed
the
slights
put
upon
olive
and
was
trying
her
best
to
discover
their
cause
some
secret
story
might
possibly
be
in
circulation
about
the
newcomer
but
so
far
jessica
had
not
been
able
to
find
it
out
one
friday
afternoon
olive
had
been
alone
in
their
sitting
room
for
several
hours
always
books
had
been
her
consolation
for
loneliness
since
the
days
when
her
only
white
friend
had
been
the
teacher
in
the
indian
school
in
her
village
yet
nevertheless
hearing
an
unexpected
knock
at
the
door
her
face
brightened
jean
is
sending
for
me
to
join
her
somewhere
perhaps
she
thought
happily
but
on
opening
the
door
her
eyes
had
widened
with
surprise
please
may
i
come
in
i
m
not
a
teacher
this
afternoon
i
am
a
visitor
jessica
hunt
had
said
at
once
i
have
been
looking
for
you
everywhere
in
the
garden
and
at
the
sorority
houses
and
on
the
verandas
to
quote
kipling
over
the
world
and
under
the
world
and
back
at
the
last
to
you
here
in
your
sitting
room
why
aren
t
you
with
the
other
girls
knowing
what
she
did
perhaps
jessica
s
question
to
olive
may
seem
cruel
yet
she
asked
it
hoping
that
olive
might
confide
in
her
the
unfriendliness
of
her
classmates
then
they
might
talk
the
matter
over
sensibly
together
and
she
might
be
able
to
help
but
alas
for
olive
though
ruth
had
warned
her
to
try
to
overcome
her
reserve
that
day
of
the
flower
fortunes
in
yellowstone
park
she
was
yet
unable
to
give
her
confidence
to
any
one
but
jack
so
now
she
only
answered
miss
hunt
quietly
it
is
because
i
am
stupider
than
the
other
girls
that
i
have
to
stay
in
my
room
to
study
more
but
i
am
through
with
my
work
now
and
awfully
glad
to
see
you
and
olive
s
rather
misty
smile
of
welcome
revealed
more
of
her
real
feeling
than
any
number
of
words
once
inside
the
ranch
girls
sitting
room
jessica
hunt
gave
a
little
cry
of
admiration
and
surprise
why
no
wonder
you
don
t
wish
to
be
outdoors
she
exclaimed
for
this
is
the
most
charming
girls
room
at
primrose
hall
it
makes
me
think
of
that
same
poem
of
kipling
s
which
i
was
misquoting
a
minute
ago
the
gypsy
you
must
read
it
some
day
when
you
re
older
for
you
look
like
a
romany
maid
yourself
and
surely
in
this
room
at
least
the
east
and
the
west
are
truly
the
ranch
girls
sitting
room
was
indeed
what
they
had
dreamed
of
making
it
in
the
last
days
at
home
a
bit
of
the
rainbow
lodge
in
miniature
their
own
beloved
ranch
house
living
room
reproduced
many
miles
across
the
continent
by
ruth
s
request
miss
winthrop
had
allotted
to
the
three
ranch
girls
a
large
and
almost
empty
room
containing
only
a
divan
a
few
chairs
and
low
bookshelves
now
the
floor
was
covered
with
half
a
dozen
gayly
colored
indian
rugs
bright
shawls
were
thrown
over
the
divan
piled
with
sofa
cushions
of
leather
and
silk
and
on
the
walls
were
prints
of
indian
heads
one
of
them
a
picture
of
a
young
girl
looking
singularly
like
olive
and
several
remington
drawings
of
cowboys
on
lonely
western
plains
over
the
open
fireplace
about
the
size
of
the
one
at
the
lodge
was
the
head
of
an
elk
shot
by
jim
colter
himself
on
the
border
of
their
own
ranch
and
on
the
mantel
the
very
brass
candlesticks
that
belonged
on
the
mantelpiece
at
home
besides
several
pieces
of
indian
crockery
the
ancient
ornaments
discovered
by
frieda
in
the
indian
cave
on
the
day
when
olive
had
made
her
first
appearance
in
the
ranch
girls
lives
but
when
jessica
had
seen
the
beauties
of
the
sitting
room
she
began
at
once
to
look
more
closely
at
the
few
photographs
which
the
ranch
girls
had
placed
on
top
of
their
bookshelves
knowing
that
there
is
no
quicker
way
to
learn
to
understand
and
enter
the
heart
of
a
school
girl
than
by
taking
an
interest
in
her
photographs
of
course
these
must
represent
the
persons
nearest
and
dearest
their
families
and
closest
friends
the
ranch
girls
had
not
a
very
large
collection
of
pictures
only
an
absurd
one
of
jim
taken
at
laramie
as
a
farewell
present
to
them
but
as
he
wore
a
stiff
collar
and
shirt
and
his
sunday
clothes
it
was
not
in
the
least
like
their
big
splendidly
handsome
friend
next
jim
s
was
one
of
ruth
and
alongside
that
one
of
frank
kent
but
almost
instinctively
jessica
s
hand
reached
forth
to
pick
up
a
photograph
of
a
girl
on
horseback
and
at
the
same
instant
she
touched
olive
s
heart
who
is
this
beautiful
girl
she
asked
quickly
she
is
just
the
type
of
girl
i
admire
the
most
so
graceful
and
vigorous
and
with
such
a
lot
of
character
oh
i
hope
i
haven
t
said
anything
i
shouldn
t
she
ended
suddenly
seeing
that
olive
s
eyes
had
filled
with
tears
olive
shook
her
head
no
it
s
all
right
only
jack
isn
t
vigorous
any
and
then
to
her
own
surprise
and
relief
olive
poured
forth
the
whole
story
of
jack
s
accident
and
their
reasons
for
coming
east
strange
and
yet
no
stranger
than
the
same
kind
of
thing
that
takes
place
every
day
but
just
as
olive
was
on
the
point
of
telling
miss
hunt
that
she
expected
each
day
to
hear
more
definite
news
of
jack
a
message
was
sent
upstairs
to
her
from
the
office
a
visitor
was
in
the
reception
room
desiring
to
see
the
misses
ralston
and
miss
bruce
at
once
would
olive
find
the
other
girls
and
come
to
the
reception
room
immediately
with
but
one
thought
in
her
mind
that
it
must
be
ruth
drew
who
had
come
to
tell
them
that
jack
was
better
olive
with
a
hurried
apology
to
jessica
begging
her
to
wait
until
her
return
fled
out
of
her
room
down
through
the
lower
part
of
the
house
and
then
out
into
the
school
grounds
to
search
for
jean
and
frieda
for
much
as
she
yearned
to
run
at
once
to
ruth
it
would
be
too
selfish
not
to
let
the
other
girls
hear
the
good
news
with
her
and
jessica
hunt
was
glad
enough
to
be
left
alone
in
the
ranch
girls
room
for
a
few
minutes
longer
for
standing
near
the
photograph
of
jacqueline
ralston
was
another
photograph
whose
presence
in
the
room
puzzled
her
greatly
she
did
not
feel
that
she
had
the
right
to
ask
curious
questions
and
yet
she
must
look
at
this
picture
more
closely
for
the
exact
copy
of
it
was
at
this
moment
lying
in
her
own
bureau
drawer
between
folds
of
silk
chapter
v
news
and
a
discovery
jean
and
frieda
were
not
to
be
found
on
either
of
the
two
great
side
porches
where
the
primrose
hall
girls
spent
many
recreation
hours
on
these
warm
indian
summer
afternoons
but
just
in
front
of
the
sorority
house
with
theta
engraved
above
the
door
olive
spied
jean
surrounded
by
a
dozen
girls
she
was
talking
in
a
very
animated
fashion
and
had
her
back
turned
so
that
she
did
not
see
olive
who
started
to
run
toward
her
and
then
hesitated
and
flushed
each
girl
in
the
group
was
known
to
her
by
name
all
of
them
were
juniors
and
her
classmates
and
yet
not
one
of
them
except
geraldine
ferrows
had
ever
voluntarily
held
five
minutes
conversation
with
her
did
she
have
the
courage
now
to
thrust
herself
among
them
and
to
interrupt
jean
only
the
thought
that
ruth
must
be
waiting
for
them
with
news
of
jack
braced
her
jean
olive
called
softly
and
then
in
a
louder
tone
jean
at
once
jean
swung
round
but
at
the
same
moment
twelve
other
pairs
of
eyes
stared
poor
olive
up
and
down
oh
i
am
so
glad
you
have
come
olive
jean
exclaimed
her
brown
eyes
shining
with
enthusiasm
for
it
has
all
been
arranged
that
i
am
to
join
the
theta
society
and
i
do
hope
that
you
will
come
in
with
me
then
we
are
going
to
form
a
dramatic
club
in
our
sorority
and
after
a
little
while
give
a
perfectly
stunning
play
i
am
sure
the
girls
will
want
you
to
take
part
in
it
for
you
see
olive
can
act
better
than
any
one
of
us
or
at
least
she
used
to
when
we
had
charades
at
rainbow
jean
paused
feeling
a
peculiar
change
in
the
atmosphere
about
her
would
no
one
echo
her
invitation
to
olive
and
why
had
her
friends
drawn
away
in
silence
unless
something
was
the
matter
for
olive
was
standing
right
before
them
with
her
cheeks
crimson
and
biting
her
lips
to
hide
their
trembling
jean
stamped
her
foot
with
a
flash
of
her
old
anger
if
you
think
for
an
instant
margaret
belknap
she
said
turning
to
her
best
friend
in
the
little
company
a
tall
distinguished
but
girl
that
i
will
be
in
things
and
do
things
without
olive
but
olive
took
jean
softly
by
the
arm
please
don
t
say
anything
dear
she
whispered
and
then
as
jean
caught
the
message
she
had
come
to
give
her
without
further
thought
of
anything
or
anybody
at
primrose
hall
the
two
friends
hurried
off
together
jean
was
not
so
conscientious
about
trying
to
find
frieda
but
leaving
word
with
the
maids
to
send
her
after
them
in
a
few
moments
the
two
girls
appeared
at
the
reception
room
door
ruth
you
darling
they
called
in
chorus
and
then
turned
white
faces
to
stare
at
each
other
and
at
the
tall
figure
that
rose
to
greet
them
holding
frieda
s
hand
in
one
of
his
it
is
peter
drummond
gooseys
don
t
you
know
him
frieda
cried
happily
some
one
told
me
we
had
a
caller
and
i
came
in
here
expecting
to
find
some
strange
horrid
visitor
and
when
i
saw
peter
i
forgot
i
wasn
t
a
little
girl
any
longer
and
most
hugged
him
you
might
say
you
think
it
good
of
him
to
come
to
see
us
she
ended
rather
crossly
we
thought
you
were
ruth
drummond
jean
replied
coming
to
herself
sooner
than
olive
but
of
course
we
are
terribly
glad
it
is
you
truth
is
we
expected
ruth
to
be
able
to
tell
us
that
jack
was
better
or
something
just
think
we
haven
t
seen
old
jack
in
weeks
ages
it
jean
put
out
her
hand
to
take
hold
of
their
friend
s
when
olive
spoke
i
think
drummond
has
come
to
tell
us
about
jack
instead
of
ruth
she
said
in
a
slightly
strained
voice
i
am
afraid
that
jack
isn
t
so
well
as
we
hoped
she
would
be
and
ruth
couldn
t
leave
her
won
t
she
ever
be
able
to
walk
again
like
other
people
have
the
doctors
said
tell
us
please
quickly
what
has
brought
you
to
see
us
for
anything
is
better
than
and
still
for
a
second
peter
drummond
did
not
reply
the
first
cause
of
his
silence
was
that
frieda
entirely
surprised
at
olive
s
interpretation
of
his
visit
had
unexpectedly
burst
into
tears
come
now
drummond
said
finally
patting
frieda
s
hand
it
isn
t
so
bad
as
all
this
olive
did
guess
the
truth
and
i
have
come
to
tell
you
about
jack
perhaps
she
isn
t
so
well
as
we
hoped
for
she
can
t
join
you
at
school
just
at
present
or
get
about
very
much
the
fact
drummond
cleared
his
throat
well
the
surgeons
are
not
quite
sure
of
jack
s
condition
yet
and
must
wait
a
while
longer
and
keep
her
very
quiet
before
they
can
decide
but
i
saw
her
a
minute
the
other
day
and
she
and
ruth
send
you
their
love
and
jack
hopes
boarding
school
isn
t
so
dreadful
as
she
thinks
it
must
be
why
doesn
t
some
one
else
say
something
for
never
before
in
my
life
have
i
been
with
three
women
and
had
to
do
all
the
talking
and
peter
with
a
man
s
embarrassment
at
being
the
bearer
of
ill
news
looked
at
the
ranch
girls
with
pretended
indignation
are
you
sure
you
have
told
us
the
truth
drummond
jean
asked
and
their
visitor
not
in
the
least
offended
by
the
question
emphatically
bowed
his
head
jean
turned
to
the
other
two
girls
then
olive
and
frieda
i
don
t
think
we
need
be
frightened
she
said
stoutly
though
of
course
we
are
terribly
disappointed
at
not
having
jack
here
at
school
with
us
i
have
always
felt
she
would
be
well
some
day
even
if
the
surgeons
should
say
she
won
t
my
money
is
on
old
jack
instantly
frieda
s
face
cleared
at
jean
s
courageous
attitude
though
olive
looked
considerably
depressed
but
at
this
minute
drummond
to
divert
everybody
s
attention
turned
toward
frieda
will
somebody
tell
me
please
what
is
the
trouble
with
the
youngest
miss
ralston
for
if
two
weeks
at
boarding
school
can
affect
her
like
this
what
will
a
whole
year
do
instinctively
frieda
s
hand
went
up
to
her
psyche
knot
don
t
tell
jack
and
ruth
she
begged
and
then
tossing
her
blonde
head
oh
tell
away
if
you
like
peter
drummond
i
haven
t
any
disease
if
that
s
what
you
mean
i
am
just
not
a
baby
any
peter
s
expression
was
a
funny
mixture
of
gravity
and
amusement
if
it
s
old
age
that
is
afflicting
you
frieda
he
said
pulling
at
his
own
heavy
hair
then
you
ve
got
about
the
worst
disease
in
the
world
and
the
most
incurable
but
i
didn
t
really
think
it
was
apt
to
overtake
one
at
seeing
that
frieda
looked
injured
he
turned
again
to
olive
and
jean
the
harmons
have
been
awfully
nice
to
jack
and
ruth
and
they
are
coming
out
here
to
see
you
pretty
soon
there
is
a
queer
old
house
in
this
neighborhood
where
an
old
relative
of
theirs
lives
the
house
is
supposed
to
be
haunted
or
at
least
there
is
some
mystery
about
it
i
wonder
if
you
girls
have
seen
it
i
have
olive
answered
quickly
and
jean
laughed
how
on
the
face
of
the
earth
do
you
know
you
have
seen
the
place
peter
is
describing
olive
jean
questioned
for
he
hasn
t
told
you
the
name
of
it
or
what
it
looks
like
or
anything
to
identify
olive
looked
puzzled
yes
i
know
it
is
funny
but
it
is
a
place
called
the
towers
with
a
high
tower
at
the
top
of
it
and
a
balcony
and
queer
little
quite
unconsciously
olive
had
closed
her
eyes
because
for
some
strange
reason
she
seemed
to
be
able
to
recall
the
house
she
had
seen
on
the
morning
of
her
early
walk
better
with
her
eyes
closed
drummond
smiled
at
her
olive
is
right
the
place
is
called
the
i
remember
now
he
repeated
i
wonder
if
because
olive
is
perhaps
a
gypsy
or
an
indian
she
is
going
to
be
a
fortune
but
because
olive
s
face
had
crimsoned
at
his
speech
his
tone
changed
my
dear
olive
suppose
you
are
half
indian
why
on
earth
should
you
care
there
isn
t
the
least
disgrace
in
it
is
there
and
olive
noticed
that
drummond
s
speech
ended
with
a
question
but
he
had
now
risen
picking
up
from
the
table
near
him
a
large
box
and
a
small
one
the
large
box
he
handed
to
jean
you
are
please
to
conceal
this
from
the
powers
that
be
if
it
s
against
boarding
school
laws
to
eat
candy
he
said
and
then
stood
turning
the
smaller
box
about
in
his
hand
surveying
it
thoughtfully
this
is
a
gift
to
you
girls
from
jack
he
remarked
finally
miss
drew
tells
me
it
contains
a
great
surprise
and
as
i
haven
t
the
faintest
idea
what
is
inside
of
it
may
i
be
present
at
its
opening
the
girls
allowed
frieda
to
tear
off
the
paper
covering
outside
the
parcel
inside
a
white
velvet
box
was
revealed
which
opened
with
a
spring
instantly
frieda
touched
this
spring
there
were
three
cries
of
oh
followed
by
a
moment
s
silence
on
the
white
satin
lining
of
the
box
were
three
pins
as
large
in
circumference
as
a
quarter
the
pins
were
composed
of
seven
lovely
jewels
shading
from
red
to
pale
violet
each
girl
took
her
gift
from
the
box
regarding
it
with
characteristic
expressions
jean
s
eyes
were
dancing
with
delight
the
dimple
showing
at
the
corner
of
her
mouth
frieda
s
blue
eyes
were
bluer
than
ever
and
her
cheeks
pinker
while
olive
s
eyes
were
overclouded
and
her
face
quivered
with
pleasure
illustration
there
were
three
cries
of
oh
followed
by
a
moment
s
silence
they
are
the
loveliest
things
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
and
the
grandest
and
now
jean
won
t
be
able
to
pretend
we
are
poor
any
more
frieda
announced
ah
but
maybe
jack
is
a
fairy
godmother
and
even
poor
girls
may
have
fairy
godmothers
jean
teased
i
think
none
of
us
have
guessed
yet
what
jack
intends
our
gifts
to
suggest
olive
added
slowly
her
eyes
still
resting
on
the
glowing
colors
of
the
jeweled
pins
don
t
you
see
drummond
that
our
pins
represent
rainbows
i
have
been
repeating
the
rainbow
colors
to
orange
yellow
green
blue
indigo
violet
and
here
are
seven
jewels
of
the
same
colors
in
our
peter
drummond
took
olive
s
pin
in
his
own
hand
right
you
are
and
jack
has
beaten
me
at
my
own
game
for
i
have
been
collecting
jewels
all
my
life
and
never
thought
of
so
pretty
an
idea
as
this
here
is
a
garnet
to
start
with
for
the
red
then
a
topaz
for
the
orange
a
yellow
diamond
next
an
emerald
for
the
green
a
sapphire
for
blue
a
blue
opal
for
indigo
and
last
of
all
an
amethyst
for
the
last
shade
of
they
are
to
make
us
think
of
the
ranch
and
the
lodge
and
the
mine
and
all
the
good
things
that
have
come
to
us
through
a
rainbow
jean
said
thoughtfully
and
then
more
huskily
i
guess
jack
is
pretty
frieda
made
a
dive
toward
the
floor
at
this
moment
rising
up
with
a
piece
of
paper
in
her
hand
this
fell
out
of
the
jewel
case
when
i
opened
it
but
i
hadn
t
time
to
pick
it
up
then
she
announced
oh
goodness
gracious
jack
of
all
people
has
written
us
a
poem
and
frieda
read
here
are
seven
colors
in
nature
and
art
what
i
think
they
mean
i
wish
you
from
my
heart
here
s
red
that
good
courage
may
fill
you
each
day
and
orange
and
yellow
to
shine
on
your
way
here
s
green
for
the
ocean
to
bear
us
afar
to
some
lovely
blue
land
neath
an
opal
star
and
yet
to
the
end
shall
we
ever
forget
our
own
prairie
fields
of
pale
violet
it
is
a
rather
hard
poem
to
understand
but
it
rhymes
pretty
well
frieda
ended
doubtfully
olive
s
loyalty
left
no
room
for
criticism
it
s
beautiful
i
think
and
i
know
what
jack
means
at
the
end
if
we
ever
do
go
to
europe
as
we
sometimes
have
planned
we
must
never
forget
the
rainbow
ranch
you
know
frieda
dear
that
the
alfalfa
clover
is
violet
and
not
pink
and
white
like
the
clover
in
the
but
the
poem
could
not
be
further
unraveled
because
drummond
had
now
to
tear
himself
away
in
order
to
catch
his
train
back
to
new
york
hurrying
out
into
the
hall
with
the
three
ranch
girls
close
behind
him
he
suddenly
came
to
an
abrupt
stop
he
had
nearly
run
into
a
young
woman
who
also
stood
still
staring
at
him
with
reproachful
blue
eyes
and
a
haughtily
held
head
peter
that
is
drummond
how
could
you
come
down
here
when
i
told
you
not
to
the
girls
heard
jessica
hunt
say
with
the
least
little
nervous
tremor
in
her
voice
drummond
bowed
to
her
coldly
i
am
very
sorry
jessica
miss
hunt
he
returned
coldly
but
i
had
not
the
faintest
idea
of
seeing
you
at
primrose
hall
you
do
not
know
it
but
the
ranch
girls
are
my
very
dear
friends
and
my
visit
was
solely
to
peter
was
moving
majestically
away
when
a
hand
was
laid
for
the
briefest
instant
on
his
coat
sleeve
this
time
a
humbler
voice
said
forgive
me
peter
i
might
have
known
you
would
never
trouble
to
come
to
see
me
that
evening
as
the
ranch
girls
were
dressing
for
dinner
jean
poked
her
head
in
olive
s
room
olive
ralston
has
it
ever
occurred
to
you
that
peter
drummond
may
have
recommended
primrose
hall
to
us
because
a
certain
young
woman
named
jessica
hunt
taught
here
men
folks
is
deep
child
powerful
deep
but
as
the
book
says
we
shall
see
what
we
shall
i
wonder
though
why
girls
and
men
can
t
fall
in
love
and
get
married
without
such
a
lot
of
fussing
and
misunderstanding
think
how
ruth
is
treating
poor
jim
when
i
fall
in
love
i
am
not
going
to
be
so
silly
and
tiresome
i
am
just
going
to
say
yes
and
thank
you
too
and
let
s
get
married
next
jean
s
face
was
very
serious
for
the
moment
and
also
very
bewitching
but
olive
answered
her
with
the
voice
of
prophecy
jean
bruce
you
will
have
the
hardest
time
of
us
all
in
making
up
your
mind
when
you
are
in
chapter
vi
her
temptation
face
to
face
with
her
first
serious
temptation
stood
jean
bruce
always
beyond
anything
else
had
she
desired
to
be
popular
even
in
the
old
days
at
the
ranch
when
the
only
society
in
which
she
had
a
part
was
composed
of
the
few
neighbors
in
riding
distance
of
the
lodge
but
here
at
primrose
hall
was
her
first
real
opportunity
to
gratify
her
heart
s
desire
and
would
she
for
the
sake
of
another
be
compelled
to
give
it
up
for
how
could
she
accept
the
honor
that
might
be
bestowed
upon
her
of
being
chosen
for
junior
class
president
without
turning
traitor
to
olive
after
her
friends
treatment
of
olive
in
front
of
the
theta
house
on
the
afternoon
of
peter
drummond
s
visit
jean
could
no
longer
shut
her
eyes
to
olive
s
unpopularity
what
was
the
cause
of
it
try
as
she
might
she
could
not
find
out
yet
the
prejudice
was
certainly
deeper
than
any
one
could
suppose
suspecting
winifred
graham
to
be
at
the
bottom
of
the
mischief
jean
kept
a
close
watch
upon
her
but
if
she
had
circulated
any
story
against
olive
no
one
would
confess
it
miss
ralston
is
so
shy
and
queer
her
appearance
is
so
odd
i
do
not
think
she
enjoys
being
with
other
girls
these
evasions
of
the
truth
were
all
jean
could
get
hold
of
but
in
the
meantime
there
was
no
doubt
that
olive
s
classmates
absolutely
refused
to
have
her
in
either
of
the
two
sororities
and
that
this
insult
was
almost
unprecedented
in
the
history
of
primrose
hall
of
course
jean
might
have
appealed
to
miss
winthrop
or
one
of
the
other
teachers
asking
that
their
influence
be
exerted
in
olive
s
behalf
but
this
for
olive
s
own
sake
she
was
unwilling
to
do
for
even
if
olive
should
be
forced
into
one
of
the
sororities
how
would
it
change
her
classmates
attitude
toward
her
would
it
not
make
them
more
unkind
than
ever
no
there
were
only
two
courses
open
to
jean
either
she
must
join
the
sorority
she
had
chosen
without
any
question
of
olive
s
being
a
member
or
else
she
must
decline
to
be
admitted
herself
until
such
time
as
the
girls
should
come
to
their
senses
and
voluntarily
desire
the
election
of
them
both
of
course
if
membership
in
one
or
the
other
of
the
two
sororities
had
been
jean
s
only
dilemma
there
had
been
small
excuse
for
her
hesitation
but
a
larger
issue
was
at
stake
unless
she
became
a
member
of
a
sorority
and
as
one
of
its
leaders
could
influence
new
girls
to
her
cause
she
might
lose
the
junior
presidency
and
winifred
graham
the
head
of
the
kappa
organization
would
surely
be
chosen
in
her
stead
jean
had
won
her
way
to
her
present
popularity
in
a
very
charming
fashion
just
by
the
power
of
her
own
personality
which
is
after
all
the
greatest
force
in
the
world
she
had
no
prominent
family
connections
as
so
many
of
the
primrose
hall
girls
had
and
she
continued
to
act
as
though
she
had
no
money
except
what
was
necessary
for
very
simple
requirements
indeed
she
behaved
as
she
must
have
done
had
the
ranch
girls
come
east
to
boarding
school
before
the
discovery
of
the
gold
mine
of
rainbow
creek
but
it
was
a
hard
fight
and
many
times
the
young
girl
longed
to
break
faith
with
herself
before
setting
out
on
their
journey
after
a
careful
reading
of
the
primrose
hall
catalogue
ruth
drew
had
ordered
the
three
ranch
girls
school
outfits
but
now
these
clothes
seemed
so
simple
and
ordinary
that
at
least
two
of
the
girls
hated
the
wearing
of
them
each
one
of
them
had
several
pretty
school
dresses
of
light
weight
flannel
and
serge
two
simple
silks
for
afternoon
entertainments
and
dinner
use
and
a
single
party
dress
for
the
monthly
dances
which
were
a
feature
of
primrose
hall
school
life
their
underclothes
were
plentiful
but
plain
indeed
until
jean
saw
her
friend
margaret
belknap
s
lingerie
she
had
supposed
that
only
brides
and
very
wealthy
ones
at
that
could
have
such
possessions
just
think
of
a
single
item
of
a
dozen
nightgowns
at
fifteen
dollars
apiece
in
a
school
girl
s
outfit
and
yet
these
were
among
margaret
s
clothes
jean
openly
expressed
her
wonder
and
yet
managed
quietly
to
refuse
to
receive
a
gift
of
two
of
them
without
hurting
her
new
friend
s
feelings
to
a
girl
brought
up
in
the
conventional
and
moneyed
atmosphere
that
margaret
belknap
had
been
jean
was
a
revelation
she
seemed
not
to
know
the
meaning
of
snobbery
not
to
care
who
people
were
so
long
as
she
liked
what
they
were
her
manners
were
as
charming
to
one
person
as
to
another
and
her
interest
as
sincere
margaret
had
already
asked
jean
to
visit
her
in
her
home
in
new
york
during
the
christmas
holidays
as
she
longed
to
introduce
her
to
her
own
family
in
order
that
they
might
lose
their
prejudice
against
western
girls
but
more
especially
margaret
desired
to
bring
her
harvard
college
brother
cecil
and
jean
together
so
as
to
find
out
what
they
would
think
of
one
another
she
was
only
awaiting
the
first
opportunity
in
the
meantime
although
jean
would
not
accept
other
gifts
from
her
wealthy
friend
she
could
not
refuse
the
flowers
margaret
so
constantly
sent
her
indeed
she
went
about
school
so
much
of
the
time
with
a
pink
carnation
tucked
in
her
hair
that
she
soon
became
known
as
the
pink
carnation
one
of
jean
s
greatest
was
not
being
able
to
send
flowers
to
margaret
in
return
but
in
order
to
retain
her
masquerade
of
poverty
most
of
the
time
she
had
to
refrain
only
now
and
then
she
did
relieve
her
feelings
by
presenting
margaret
a
bunch
of
violets
or
roses
regardless
of
cost
and
occasionally
a
box
of
roses
or
chrysanthemums
would
find
their
way
into
the
room
of
a
teacher
who
had
been
especially
kind
to
olive
frieda
or
her
with
olive
there
was
apparently
no
in
failing
to
spread
abroad
the
news
of
their
wealth
and
in
spending
no
pocket
money
but
with
frieda
the
case
was
very
different
it
is
quite
certain
that
jean
would
never
have
had
her
way
with
frieda
except
by
appealing
directly
to
jack
for
advice
and
assistance
when
the
letter
from
jack
came
begging
her
little
sister
to
keep
the
secret
of
their
wealth
and
to
agree
to
jean
s
plan
frieda
s
rebellion
had
weakened
not
that
she
saw
any
sense
in
her
sacrifice
or
was
in
the
least
reconciled
to
it
but
simply
because
under
the
circumstances
while
jack
was
still
so
ill
she
could
refuse
her
nothing
and
this
was
particularly
hard
on
both
the
ranch
girls
because
never
before
in
their
lives
had
they
had
any
money
of
their
own
to
spend
and
now
jack
was
sending
each
one
of
them
fifty
dollars
a
month
for
pin
money
think
of
the
fortune
of
it
if
you
have
had
only
of
that
amount
per
month
for
your
own
use
before
and
yet
so
far
only
once
in
all
the
weeks
had
frieda
yielded
to
temptation
going
up
to
new
york
one
saturday
for
her
first
visit
to
the
grand
opera
she
had
drifted
into
a
big
department
store
with
half
a
dozen
of
the
other
school
girls
and
their
chaperon
in
order
to
buy
herself
a
pair
of
gloves
late
that
same
afternoon
jean
and
olive
who
happened
at
the
time
to
be
dressing
for
dinner
received
a
shock
an
elegant
young
woman
arrayed
in
a
dark
blue
velvet
coat
and
a
hat
encircled
with
a
large
feather
entering
jean
s
room
dropped
exhausted
on
the
bed
a
cry
brought
olive
to
the
scene
but
either
because
frieda
looked
too
pretty
in
her
new
clothes
to
scold
or
because
she
pretended
to
be
ill
from
fatigue
no
word
of
reproach
was
spoken
to
her
not
even
when
a
pale
blue
silk
followed
next
morning
by
the
early
express
and
dollars
had
to
be
borrowed
from
olive
and
jean
to
pay
for
it
possibly
both
of
the
older
girls
were
secretly
pleased
at
frieda
s
extravagance
because
while
saving
money
is
a
virtuous
act
it
certainly
is
a
very
dull
one
and
while
olive
was
storing
her
income
away
in
a
lock
box
wondering
if
it
were
possible
to
return
it
some
day
in
a
gift
for
jack
jean
was
also
hoarding
hers
in
the
same
fashion
but
intending
finally
to
spend
it
all
in
one
grand
splurge
while
jean
often
regretted
having
taken
the
vow
of
poverty
at
primrose
hall
she
was
always
convinced
of
its
wisdom
that
there
could
be
so
much
talk
and
thought
of
money
as
she
had
lately
heard
among
the
set
of
girls
of
whom
winifred
graham
was
leader
was
repellant
to
her
and
as
jean
already
had
developed
strong
class
feeling
one
of
her
chief
reasons
for
desiring
to
be
elected
junior
class
president
was
in
order
to
prove
that
this
snobbish
set
was
not
really
in
control
of
primrose
hall
would
ruth
and
jack
and
jim
colter
the
overseer
of
their
ranch
who
had
always
said
money
would
be
the
ruination
of
jean
not
feel
proud
of
her
if
they
could
hear
that
she
won
out
in
her
battle
without
its
help
and
yet
what
would
they
think
of
her
if
she
turned
her
back
on
olive
surely
if
jean
had
not
been
so
harassed
and
torn
between
the
twin
enemies
ambition
and
love
she
would
hardly
have
accused
olive
of
being
the
cause
of
her
own
unpopularity
and
certainly
not
at
so
unpropitious
an
hour
as
she
chose
but
the
time
for
jean
to
make
up
her
mind
one
way
or
another
was
drawing
close
at
hand
and
so
far
olive
had
no
idea
of
her
friend
s
struggle
naturally
supposing
that
jean
had
already
entered
the
theta
society
without
mentioning
it
to
her
in
order
to
spare
her
pride
monthly
dances
were
an
institution
at
primrose
hall
and
it
was
now
the
evening
of
the
first
one
of
them
of
course
dances
at
girls
boarding
schools
are
not
unusual
but
the
dances
at
primrose
hall
were
for
miss
winthrop
allowed
young
men
to
be
present
at
them
her
guests
were
brothers
and
cousins
of
her
students
or
else
intimate
friends
carefully
introduced
by
the
girls
parents
miss
winthrop
regarded
primrose
hall
as
a
training
school
for
the
larger
social
world
and
desired
her
students
to
learn
to
accept
an
acquaintance
with
young
men
as
simply
and
naturally
as
they
did
the
same
acquaintance
with
girls
if
young
girls
and
boys
never
saw
or
spoke
to
one
another
during
the
years
of
their
school
life
it
was
miss
winthrop
s
idea
that
they
developed
false
notions
in
regard
to
one
another
and
false
attitudes
therefore
although
no
one
could
be
more
severe
than
the
principal
of
primrose
hall
toward
any
shadow
of
flirtation
she
was
entirely
reasonable
toward
a
simple
friendship
it
was
because
most
of
her
girls
had
respected
miss
winthrop
s
judgment
in
this
matter
that
her
monthly
dances
at
first
much
criticized
had
since
become
a
great
success
watching
her
students
and
their
friends
together
the
older
woman
could
often
give
her
students
the
help
and
advice
they
needed
in
their
first
knowledge
of
young
men
so
when
olive
sent
down
an
imploring
message
asking
to
be
excused
from
attendance
at
these
monthly
dances
miss
winthrop
had
positively
refused
her
request
no
excuse
save
illness
was
ever
accepted
from
either
the
junior
or
senior
girls
it
was
a
quarter
before
eight
o
clock
and
the
dance
was
to
begin
at
eight
that
evening
when
olive
already
dressed
strolled
slowly
into
jean
s
and
frieda
s
room
pretending
that
she
wished
to
assist
them
but
really
longing
for
some
word
of
sympathy
or
encouragement
to
help
her
in
overcoming
her
shyness
frieda
had
slipped
across
the
hall
to
show
herself
in
her
new
blue
gown
to
the
johnson
sisters
therefore
jean
was
alone
at
the
very
instant
of
olive
s
entrance
she
was
thinking
of
her
with
a
good
deal
of
annoyance
and
uncertainty
and
now
the
very
fact
that
olive
looked
so
charming
in
a
crepe
dress
made
her
crosser
than
ever
when
olive
was
so
pretty
how
could
the
school
girls
fail
to
like
her
but
olive
immediately
on
entering
the
room
and
entirely
unconscious
of
jean
s
anger
stood
silent
for
a
moment
lost
in
admiration
of
her
friend
s
appearance
in
truth
jean
was
a
pink
carnation
girl
for
margaret
belknap
had
sent
her
a
great
box
of
the
deep
variety
and
she
wore
a
wreath
of
them
in
her
hair
quite
by
accident
her
frock
happened
to
be
of
the
same
color
and
the
rose
was
particularly
becoming
to
her
healthy
pallor
and
the
dark
brown
of
her
hair
while
the
excitement
of
attending
her
first
school
dance
made
jean
s
brown
eyes
sparkle
and
her
lips
a
deep
crimson
i
do
wish
ruth
could
see
you
olive
said
wistfully
for
i
think
she
has
already
cared
more
for
you
than
even
for
frieda
or
and
not
for
you
at
all
olive
i
suppose
jean
answered
ungraciously
i
do
wish
you
would
get
over
the
habit
of
depreciating
yourself
didn
t
miss
winthrop
say
the
other
day
that
we
generally
got
what
we
expected
in
this
world
and
if
you
don
t
expect
people
to
like
you
and
are
too
shy
and
proud
to
let
them
why
how
can
they
be
nice
to
you
olive
colored
but
did
not
reply
at
once
i
do
wish
jack
were
here
jean
continued
for
she
would
have
some
influence
with
you
and
not
let
you
be
so
pokey
and
unfriendly
i
am
sure
i
have
tried
in
vain
to
stir
you
up
and
now
i
think
i
ll
write
jack
and
ruth
how
you
are
behaving
really
you
are
spoiling
frieda
s
and
my
good
times
at
school
by
being
so
stiff
and
and
jean
knowing
that
olive
did
not
yet
understand
how
her
failure
to
be
invited
into
either
sorority
was
influencing
her
chance
for
the
class
election
yet
had
the
grace
to
turn
her
face
away
for
olive
had
grown
white
please
don
t
write
to
jack
or
ruth
jean
she
asked
quietly
i
do
not
wish
them
to
know
i
am
not
a
success
at
school
and
if
you
tell
them
that
no
one
here
likes
me
they
will
then
know
that
i
am
unhappy
and
will
be
worried
and
jack
must
not
have
any
worry
now
it
isn
t
that
i
don
t
try
to
make
the
girls
like
me
you
are
mistaken
if
you
think
i
don
t
try
but
oh
what
is
the
matter
with
me
jean
that
makes
me
so
unpopular
in
an
instant
jean
s
arms
were
about
olive
and
she
was
kissing
her
warmly
don
t
be
a
goose
dear
there
is
nothing
the
matter
with
you
and
you
are
not
unpopular
really
it
is
just
some
horrid
silly
mistake
now
promise
me
that
you
won
t
be
frightened
and
you
will
be
friendly
with
in
this
instant
jean
made
up
her
mind
that
in
some
unexplainable
way
olive
must
be
standing
in
her
own
light
or
else
her
classmates
must
see
how
charming
she
was
olive
promised
with
a
quaking
heart
knowing
that
many
eyes
would
soon
be
upon
her
including
miss
winthrop
s
who
would
be
noticing
her
unpopularity
and
would
she
know
a
single
guest
at
the
dance
frieda
and
mollie
johnson
had
already
disappeared
so
that
jean
and
olive
went
down
to
the
big
reception
rooms
together
holding
each
other
s
hands
like
little
girls
chapter
vii
cinderella
to
miss
katherine
winthrop
s
credit
it
must
be
stated
that
she
desired
her
students
at
primrose
hall
to
grow
into
something
more
useful
than
mere
society
women
her
ambition
was
to
have
them
fill
many
important
positions
in
the
modern
world
now
offering
such
big
opportunities
to
clever
women
miss
winthrop
was
herself
an
unusually
clever
woman
cold
perhaps
and
not
sympathetic
with
most
of
her
girls
but
just
always
and
interested
in
their
welfare
but
then
none
of
her
girls
knew
the
story
of
her
youth
nor
realized
that
the
last
life
she
had
ever
expected
for
herself
in
her
rich
and
brilliant
girlhood
was
that
of
a
mistress
of
a
fashionable
boarding
school
years
before
katherine
winthrop
had
been
the
belle
and
beauty
of
the
countryside
a
toast
in
new
york
city
and
in
the
homes
of
the
old
dutch
and
english
families
along
the
hudson
river
until
she
had
let
her
pride
spoil
the
one
romance
of
her
life
by
and
by
when
her
father
died
and
her
family
fortune
disappeared
she
had
then
opened
up
her
old
home
as
a
girls
boarding
school
and
her
aristocratic
connections
and
old
name
immediately
made
primrose
hall
both
fashionable
and
popular
until
now
its
mere
name
lent
its
students
an
assured
social
prestige
nevertheless
miss
winthrop
wished
her
school
to
be
something
more
than
fashionable
indeed
this
thought
had
been
in
her
mind
when
she
had
chosen
the
ranch
girls
for
her
pupils
from
among
a
list
of
fifty
or
more
applicants
whom
she
had
been
obliged
to
refuse
there
was
little
in
the
life
of
her
school
which
she
did
not
see
and
understand
and
now
her
hope
was
that
jean
and
olive
and
frieda
with
their
freedom
from
snobbery
their
simplicity
and
broader
way
of
looking
at
things
would
bring
the
element
most
needed
into
their
mere
and
conventional
eastern
atmosphere
though
no
one
had
mentioned
it
to
her
she
had
already
observed
jean
s
great
popularity
with
her
classmates
frieda
s
good
time
among
the
younger
girls
and
olive
s
failure
to
make
friends
what
was
the
trouble
with
this
third
ranch
girl
although
miss
winthrop
had
been
particularly
busy
for
the
past
month
in
getting
her
school
into
good
working
order
she
had
not
forgotten
the
peculiar
emotion
that
olive
had
awakened
in
her
at
their
first
meeting
because
the
child
was
unusual
in
her
manner
and
appearance
was
scarcely
a
sufficient
reason
for
the
universal
prejudice
against
her
and
at
the
first
dance
of
the
school
season
miss
winthrop
had
determined
to
watch
olive
closely
and
find
out
for
herself
wherein
lay
the
difficulty
jessica
hunt
was
receiving
with
miss
winthrop
and
had
also
wondered
how
olive
would
stand
the
ordeal
of
their
first
evening
entertainment
for
the
dances
at
primrose
hall
were
not
informal
it
being
a
part
of
the
principal
s
idea
that
they
should
train
her
girls
for
social
life
in
any
part
of
the
world
where
in
later
years
circumstances
might
chance
to
take
them
miss
winthrop
her
teachers
and
students
always
appeared
in
full
evening
dress
at
these
entertainments
and
this
evening
miss
winthrop
wore
a
plain
black
velvet
gown
with
a
small
diamond
star
at
her
throat
a
piece
of
jewelry
for
which
she
had
a
peculiar
affection
jessica
hunt
who
was
standing
next
her
was
in
pure
white
so
that
her
blue
eyes
and
the
of
her
hair
so
like
jack
s
olive
had
thought
made
a
striking
contrast
with
the
darker
sterner
beauty
of
the
older
woman
though
there
were
a
dozen
or
more
of
the
primrose
hall
girls
grouped
about
the
two
women
when
jean
and
olive
entered
the
reception
room
together
both
of
them
immediately
saw
and
watched
them
as
they
came
slowly
forward
the
eyes
of
jean
the
flush
and
sparkle
of
her
spoke
of
her
anticipation
of
unutterable
delights
yet
who
should
know
as
she
moved
through
the
room
with
an
expression
of
fine
unconsciousness
that
this
was
the
first
really
formal
party
she
had
ever
attended
in
her
life
neither
her
blush
nor
her
dimple
betrayed
her
although
she
was
perfectly
aware
that
a
number
of
youths
in
coats
and
black
trousers
wearing
immaculate
white
gloves
and
ties
had
stopped
talking
for
several
moments
to
their
girl
friends
in
order
to
glance
at
olive
and
at
her
she
even
saw
without
appearing
to
lift
her
lids
that
a
tall
blonde
fellow
standing
near
her
friend
margaret
belknap
was
deliberately
staring
at
her
through
a
pair
of
eyeglasses
and
at
once
jean
decided
that
the
young
man
was
extremely
ugly
in
spite
of
his
fashionable
clothes
and
therefore
not
to
be
compared
to
ralph
merrit
or
other
simple
western
fellows
whom
she
had
known
in
the
past
perhaps
five
minutes
were
required
for
this
list
of
jean
s
passing
observations
in
her
forward
progress
toward
miss
winthrop
and
yet
in
the
same
length
of
time
olive
who
was
close
beside
her
had
seen
nothing
but
a
sea
of
unknown
even
her
school
companions
in
their
frocks
of
silk
and
lace
looked
unfamiliar
and
yet
somehow
with
jean
s
assistance
she
also
managed
to
arrive
in
front
of
miss
winthrop
and
jessica
hunt
and
to
pay
her
respects
to
them
then
still
sticking
close
to
jean
she
was
soon
borne
off
for
a
short
distance
and
there
surrounded
by
a
group
of
jean
s
girl
friends
half
a
dozen
or
more
of
them
gerry
ferrows
and
margaret
belknap
in
the
number
had
come
up
with
their
cousins
brothers
and
friends
to
meet
jean
bruce
and
to
fill
up
her
dance
card
they
were
of
course
also
introduced
to
olive
but
as
she
did
not
speak
no
one
noticed
her
particularly
and
no
one
invited
her
to
dance
jean
had
not
intended
to
desert
olive
but
when
the
music
of
the
first
waltz
began
she
forgot
her
and
marched
off
with
an
enthusiastic
partner
who
had
asked
gerry
ferrows
to
introduce
him
to
the
most
fascinating
girl
in
the
room
and
gerry
had
unhesitatingly
chosen
jean
there
were
two
or
three
other
girls
and
young
men
standing
near
olive
when
jean
had
turned
away
but
a
few
seconds
later
and
she
was
entirely
alone
is
there
greater
anguish
than
for
a
shy
girl
unaccustomed
to
society
to
find
herself
solitary
in
a
crowded
ballroom
at
first
olive
felt
desperate
knowing
that
her
cheeks
were
crimson
with
shame
and
fearing
that
her
eyes
were
filling
with
tears
then
looking
about
her
she
soon
discovered
a
group
of
palms
in
a
corner
of
the
room
not
far
away
and
guessed
that
she
could
find
shelter
behind
them
slipping
across
she
came
upon
a
small
sofa
hidden
behind
the
evergreens
and
with
a
little
sigh
of
thanksgiving
sank
down
upon
it
soon
after
olive
began
to
grow
serene
for
from
her
retreat
she
could
watch
the
dancers
and
see
what
a
good
time
jean
and
frieda
were
having
without
being
seen
herself
once
she
almost
laughed
aloud
as
frieda
waltzed
by
her
hiding
who
had
been
a
fat
little
girl
with
long
plaits
down
her
back
just
a
few
weeks
ago
now
attired
in
a
blue
silk
and
lace
was
whirling
about
on
the
arm
of
a
boy
who
had
such
a
small
nose
and
ridiculous
quantity
of
blonde
curls
that
he
might
almost
have
been
frieda
s
twin
brother
five
minutes
later
olive
decided
that
jean
was
the
belle
of
the
evening
and
that
she
would
write
the
news
to
jack
for
apparently
every
young
man
in
the
ballroom
was
wishing
to
dance
with
her
even
the
supercilious
fellow
with
the
eyeglasses
whom
olive
recognized
as
margaret
belknap
s
harvard
brother
could
be
seen
dancing
attendance
on
jean
twenty
minutes
half
an
hour
must
have
passed
by
in
this
fashion
until
olive
felt
perfectly
safe
in
her
green
retreat
when
unexpectedly
a
hand
was
laid
upon
her
shoulder
and
a
voice
said
sternly
what
in
the
world
child
are
you
doing
hiding
yourself
in
here
when
i
said
you
could
not
stay
up
in
your
room
it
was
because
i
desired
you
to
take
part
in
the
dancing
there
really
isn
t
much
difference
between
your
being
concealed
up
there
or
and
then
to
olive
s
discouragement
an
absurd
catch
in
her
breath
made
her
unable
to
answer
at
once
olive
s
retreat
behind
the
palms
had
not
been
unnoticed
as
she
had
thought
for
both
miss
winthrop
and
jessica
hunt
had
seen
first
her
embarrassment
at
being
left
alone
and
next
her
withdrawal
in
much
the
same
fashion
that
jack
would
have
followed
jessica
had
wished
to
rush
off
at
once
to
comfort
olive
but
miss
winthrop
had
held
her
back
what
is
the
difficulty
about
this
girl
jessica
what
makes
her
so
unpopular
she
had
asked
when
every
one
else
was
out
of
hearing
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
if
you
know
any
explanation
for
but
jessica
had
only
been
able
to
shake
her
head
answering
i
can
t
for
the
life
of
me
understand
there
are
a
good
many
little
things
that
olive
does
not
seem
to
know
and
yet
as
she
studies
very
hard
i
believe
she
will
soon
be
one
of
the
honor
girls
in
my
class
i
have
a
friend
in
new
york
or
an
acquaintance
rather
and
here
jessica
blushed
unaccountably
who
seems
to
know
the
ranch
girls
very
well
perhaps
i
had
best
ask
him
if
there
is
anything
unusual
about
but
the
older
woman
had
interrupted
no
i
had
rather
you
would
ask
no
questions
at
least
not
now
please
jessica
for
i
have
heard
at
least
a
part
of
the
girl
s
history
and
yet
i
believe
the
real
truth
is
not
known
to
any
one
and
perhaps
never
will
be
it
may
be
happier
for
olive
if
it
never
is
found
out
but
i
wish
we
could
teach
her
not
to
be
so
and
then
when
the
opportunity
arrived
miss
winthrop
had
moved
across
the
room
to
where
olive
was
in
hiding
as
the
girl
s
startled
brown
eyes
were
upturned
to
hers
miss
winthrop
who
was
not
poetic
yet
thought
that
her
pupil
in
her
pale
green
dress
with
her
queer
pointed
chin
and
her
air
of
mystery
somehow
suggested
a
girl
from
some
old
fairy
legend
of
the
sea
and
she
wondered
why
the
girls
and
young
men
in
the
ballroom
had
not
also
seen
olive
s
unusual
beauty
forgetting
that
young
people
seldom
admire
what
is
out
of
the
ordinary
some
impulse
after
her
first
speech
to
olive
made
the
older
woman
quickly
put
out
her
hand
clasping
olive
s
slender
brown
fingers
in
hers
don
t
be
afraid
of
me
she
said
in
a
voice
that
was
gentler
than
usual
for
i
understand
it
is
timidity
that
is
making
you
hide
yourself
don
t
you
think
though
that
you
would
enjoy
dancing
olive
s
face
was
suddenly
aglow
i
should
love
it
she
returned
forgetting
for
the
instant
her
shyness
only
no
one
has
invited
then
as
her
teacher
suddenly
rose
to
her
feet
as
though
intending
to
find
her
a
partner
with
a
sudden
accession
of
dignity
and
fearlessness
olive
drew
her
down
again
please
don
t
ask
anyone
to
dance
with
me
miss
winthrop
she
begged
if
you
will
sit
by
me
for
a
little
while
i
am
sure
it
will
be
delightful
just
watching
the
while
the
woman
and
girl
were
quietly
gazing
at
the
dancers
miss
winthrop
happened
to
notice
a
silver
chain
with
a
cross
at
the
end
of
it
which
olive
was
wearing
around
her
throat
leaning
over
she
took
the
cross
in
her
hand
this
is
an
odd
piece
of
jewelry
child
and
must
be
very
old
it
is
so
heavy
that
i
wonder
if
there
is
anything
concealed
inside
olive
shook
her
head
no
that
is
i
don
t
know
anything
about
it
except
that
i
hope
it
once
belonged
to
my
mother
she
replied
for
some
strange
reason
this
shy
girl
was
speaking
of
her
mother
to
a
comparative
stranger
when
she
rarely
had
spoken
the
name
even
to
her
best
beloved
friend
jacqueline
ralston
but
before
miss
winthrop
had
time
to
reply
a
new
voice
startled
both
of
them
why
olive
ralston
it
exclaimed
what
do
you
mean
by
hiding
yourself
away
with
miss
winthrop
when
i
have
been
searching
the
house
over
for
turning
around
to
her
intense
surprise
olive
now
beheld
donald
harmon
standing
near
them
the
young
fellow
whose
father
had
rented
the
rainbow
ranch
from
the
ralston
girls
the
summer
before
and
whose
sister
had
been
responsible
for
jack
ralston
s
fall
over
the
cliff
i
wonder
why
you
would
not
tell
olive
that
i
was
to
be
one
of
your
guests
miss
winthrop
he
continued
and
that
my
aunt
is
your
old
friend
and
lives
near
primrose
while
miss
winthrop
was
laughing
and
protesting
that
she
had
no
idea
that
olive
and
donald
could
know
each
other
donald
was
trying
to
persuade
olive
out
on
the
ballroom
floor
for
her
first
dance
with
him
by
accident
it
happened
to
be
a
spanish
waltz
and
olive
had
not
danced
it
before
but
she
had
been
watching
the
other
girls
donald
was
an
excellent
partner
and
in
five
minutes
she
might
have
been
dancing
it
all
her
life
now
dancing
with
olive
and
with
jean
was
quite
a
different
art
although
both
of
the
girls
were
beautiful
dancers
jean
was
gay
and
vivacious
full
of
grace
and
activity
keeping
excellent
time
to
the
music
but
olive
seemed
to
move
like
a
flower
that
is
swayed
by
the
wind
hardly
conscious
of
what
she
was
dancing
or
how
she
was
dancing
it
and
yet
yielding
her
body
to
every
note
of
the
music
and
movement
of
her
partner
by
and
by
as
olive
and
donald
continued
their
dancing
many
of
the
others
stopped
and
at
once
the
young
men
demanded
to
be
told
who
olive
was
and
why
she
had
been
hidden
away
from
their
sight
until
now
whatever
replies
the
girls
may
have
made
to
these
questions
they
did
not
apparently
affect
their
questioners
for
from
the
time
of
her
first
dance
until
the
close
of
the
evening
olive
no
longer
lacked
for
partners
she
did
not
talk
very
much
but
her
eyes
shone
and
her
cheeks
grew
crimson
with
pleasure
and
now
and
then
her
low
laugh
rang
out
and
always
she
could
dance
what
did
conversation
at
a
ball
amount
to
anyhow
when
movement
was
the
thing
and
this
stranger
girl
could
dance
like
a
fairy
princess
just
awakened
from
a
long
enchantment
donald
harmon
grew
sorry
later
in
the
evening
that
he
had
ever
brought
olive
forth
from
her
retreat
but
just
before
midnight
when
primrose
hall
parties
must
always
come
to
an
end
he
did
manage
to
get
her
away
for
a
moment
out
on
the
veranda
where
chairs
were
placed
so
that
the
young
people
could
rest
and
talk
chapter
viii
shadows
before
the
veranda
was
prettily
lighted
with
japanese
lanterns
and
shaded
electric
lights
and
donald
found
chairs
for
olive
and
himself
in
a
corner
where
they
could
see
the
dancers
and
yet
not
be
interrupted
for
he
wished
to
talk
to
her
alone
for
a
few
moments
never
having
forgotten
the
impression
she
had
made
upon
him
at
their
first
meeting
nor
the
peculiar
likeness
which
he
still
saw
in
her
to
his
mother
but
though
olive
could
not
forget
the
harmons
she
had
never
really
liked
them
nor
could
she
forgive
the
hurt
which
elizabeth
had
innocently
brought
upon
her
beloved
jack
and
yet
as
she
knew
that
this
attitude
on
her
part
was
hardly
fair
she
now
turned
to
donald
i
hope
your
mother
and
elizabeth
are
quite
well
she
inquired
with
unconscious
coldness
donald
felt
the
coldness
but
answered
at
once
yes
they
are
both
unusually
well
these
days
and
if
beth
could
only
hear
that
your
friend
miss
ralston
was
going
to
get
quite
well
why
she
would
brace
up
a
lot
but
she
worries
about
her
a
great
deal
so
she
and
my
mother
have
just
come
out
here
to
tarrydale
for
a
short
visit
to
my
aunt
i
got
away
from
college
for
a
few
days
to
be
with
them
and
to
see
you
ranch
girls
again
he
ended
honestly
you
are
very
kind
olive
murmured
watching
the
for
a
glimpse
of
jean
or
frieda
elizabeth
and
mother
wish
you
to
come
over
very
soon
and
have
tea
with
them
the
young
man
urged
appearing
not
to
notice
his
companion
s
lack
of
interest
my
aunt
s
place
is
very
near
primrose
hall
so
you
can
easily
walk
olive
shook
her
head
i
don
t
believe
miss
winthrop
would
care
to
have
us
go
about
the
neighborhood
making
visits
she
announced
glad
of
what
seemed
to
her
a
reasonable
excuse
donald
laughed
although
he
did
feel
somewhat
hurt
by
olive
s
manner
don
t
try
to
get
out
of
coming
to
see
us
for
any
such
cause
miss
olive
he
protested
for
miss
winthrop
is
one
of
my
aunt
s
dearest
friends
and
she
and
my
mother
have
known
one
another
since
they
were
girls
why
my
aunt
is
one
of
the
shareholders
in
this
school
and
is
always
offering
prizes
to
the
girls
a
shakespeare
prize
and
perhaps
some
others
that
i
don
t
know
about
you
see
i
was
going
to
ask
miss
winthrop
to
bring
you
and
miss
bruce
and
frieda
over
to
us
as
she
always
comes
to
see
my
aunt
every
week
now
that
aunt
agatha
has
grown
too
old
and
too
cranky
to
leave
her
olive
was
essentially
gentle
in
her
disposition
and
knowing
that
donald
had
always
been
their
friend
in
all
family
difficulties
she
was
sorry
to
have
seemed
unkind
i
ll
tell
jean
and
frieda
she
replied
with
more
enthusiasm
and
if
miss
winthrop
is
willing
why
of
course
we
will
be
happy
to
come
you
are
staying
at
the
towers
aren
t
you
the
white
house
at
the
end
of
the
woods
with
a
tower
at
the
top
of
it
and
queer
gabled
windows
and
two
absurd
dogs
on
either
side
the
front
door
the
young
man
nodded
you
have
seen
the
place
haven
t
you
we
are
dreadfully
ashamed
of
those
dogs
now
but
we
used
to
love
them
as
children
i
suppose
a
good
many
generations
of
the
children
in
our
family
have
had
glorious
rides
on
their
olive
frowned
a
wave
of
color
sweeping
over
her
face
which
even
in
the
glow
of
the
artificial
lights
donald
was
able
to
see
i
wonder
she
said
about
that
tower
room
isn
t
it
very
big
with
guns
and
swords
and
things
around
the
walls
and
books
and
a
man
in
armor
standing
in
one
corner
donald
stared
as
olive
s
face
went
suddenly
white
again
i
am
sorry
i
made
such
a
silly
speech
of
course
your
tower
room
isn
t
like
that
i
think
i
must
just
have
read
of
some
such
a
room
at
the
top
of
a
house
somewhere
that
looks
like
yours
only
i
want
to
ask
you
a
few
at
this
instant
a
pair
of
hands
were
suddenly
clasped
over
olive
s
eyes
and
a
voice
asked
oh
tell
me
lady
fair
and
blind
whose
hands
about
thee
are
entwined
the
voice
there
was
little
difficulty
in
recognizing
for
jean
had
come
up
quietly
behind
olive
and
donald
with
cecil
belknap
and
with
gerry
ferrows
and
one
of
her
friends
jean
promptly
began
a
conversation
with
donald
gerry
and
her
friend
after
being
properly
introduced
to
the
others
continued
their
discussion
so
there
was
nothing
for
poor
olive
to
do
but
to
try
to
talk
to
cecil
rather
more
sure
of
counting
on
jean
s
interest
in
his
invitation
than
olive
s
donald
harmon
had
promptly
repeated
his
request
to
her
so
that
for
five
minutes
or
more
they
were
deep
in
questions
and
answers
jean
laughingly
reproaching
donald
for
not
having
asked
her
to
dance
all
evening
while
he
assured
her
that
in
vain
had
he
tried
to
break
through
the
wall
of
her
admirers
when
a
truce
was
finally
declared
jean
smilingly
accepted
his
invitation
to
tea
and
then
turning
stood
for
a
moment
with
her
eyes
dancing
as
she
watched
olive
s
struggle
to
keep
up
a
conversation
with
cecil
belknap
the
subject
of
the
weather
had
evidently
been
exhausted
also
the
beauty
of
the
moon
even
now
peeping
over
one
of
the
ridges
of
the
sleepy
hollow
hills
and
still
olive
was
struggling
bravely
on
without
the
least
assistance
from
her
superior
companion
who
merely
stared
at
her
without
volunteering
a
single
remark
jean
s
laugh
rang
out
mischievously
i
do
ask
your
pardon
olive
for
having
left
you
to
talk
to
belknap
so
long
just
think
she
turned
to
look
up
at
the
young
man
with
her
most
demure
expression
i
used
to
think
the
sphinx
a
woman
but
now
i
am
entirely
convinced
that
he
or
she
is
a
harvard
student
for
surely
nothing
else
could
be
so
equally
silent
and
cecil
belknap
s
glasses
slid
off
his
nose
could
it
be
that
this
small
ranch
girl
whom
he
had
been
trying
to
be
nice
to
all
evening
on
account
of
his
sister
s
affection
for
her
was
actually
poking
fun
at
him
a
harvard
senior
and
heir
to
half
a
million
dollars
the
thing
was
impossible
had
she
not
realized
that
his
mere
presence
near
her
had
added
to
her
social
distinction
all
evening
could
it
be
that
she
had
also
expected
him
to
chatter
with
her
like
any
ordinary
schoolboy
winifred
graham
would
have
had
no
such
ridiculous
ideas
and
cecil
now
hoped
it
was
not
too
late
to
reduce
jean
to
a
proper
state
of
humility
however
jean
at
this
moment
asking
pardon
for
her
rudeness
drew
olive
aside
olive
she
whispered
in
her
friend
s
ear
in
rather
anxious
and
annoyed
tones
have
you
seen
anything
of
frieda
ralston
for
the
past
hour
i
told
that
young
lady
to
come
and
speak
to
one
or
the
other
of
us
every
half
hour
all
this
evening
and
she
has
never
been
near
me
a
single
time
has
she
spoken
to
you
olive
laughed
shaking
her
head
no
frieda
has
never
spoken
to
me
she
replied
but
once
in
dancing
by
me
she
did
deign
to
smile
as
though
we
had
met
somewhere
before
isn
t
she
funny
but
jean
was
not
amused
she
s
perfectly
ridiculous
with
her
airs
and
i
wish
ruth
were
here
to
send
her
upstairs
to
bed
you
know
it
is
nearly
twelve
o
clock
olive
and
our
dance
will
be
over
at
exactly
twelve
and
then
miss
winthrop
expects
each
one
of
us
to
come
up
and
personally
say
to
her
suppose
frieda
and
that
johnson
child
should
not
be
around
for
i
can
t
find
mollie
either
i
wonder
if
they
have
gone
off
anywhere
with
that
grasshopper
of
a
boy
you
take
frieda
too
seriously
jean
olive
murmured
she
is
sure
to
be
in
the
parlor
and
will
say
with
the
rest
of
us
you
see
we
are
so
used
to
thinking
of
her
as
a
baby
that
we
can
t
get
used
to
her
but
the
two
ranch
girls
could
not
continue
indefinitely
to
talk
of
family
matters
with
strangers
waiting
near
them
anyhow
just
at
this
moment
the
big
clock
in
the
hall
the
same
clock
that
olive
had
listened
to
so
long
on
that
first
night
at
primrose
hall
now
slowly
began
to
boom
forth
the
hour
of
midnight
and
at
the
same
moment
the
music
began
to
play
the
farewell
strains
of
the
home
sweet
home
waltz
cecil
belknap
straightway
offered
his
arm
to
olive
not
that
he
desired
her
as
a
partner
but
that
he
wished
to
punish
jean
a
moment
later
gerry
and
her
friend
entered
the
ballroom
so
that
naturally
donald
and
jean
were
compelled
to
have
this
last
dance
together
of
course
donald
would
have
preferred
olive
but
any
ranch
girl
was
sure
of
being
second
best
however
donald
need
not
have
worried
over
jean
s
being
forced
upon
him
for
no
sooner
had
they
come
into
the
parlor
with
the
other
dancers
than
two
young
fellows
seizing
hold
of
jean
declared
she
had
promised
the
home
sweet
home
waltz
to
both
of
them
and
almost
forcibly
bore
her
away
to
divide
the
dance
between
them
so
with
nothing
better
left
to
do
donald
stood
for
a
moment
watching
olive
and
cecil
belknap
they
were
having
a
conspicuously
sad
time
for
cecil
could
not
dance
and
so
olive
was
miserable
rushing
to
the
rescue
donald
bore
his
first
partner
away
and
now
cecil
had
the
desire
of
his
heart
for
jean
s
benefit
he
spent
the
closing
moments
of
the
evening
in
the
society
of
her
rival
winifred
graham
however
the
young
man
would
have
been
better
satisfied
could
he
have
known
whether
or
not
the
western
girl
noticed
his
desertion
his
sister
had
asked
him
to
be
nice
to
jean
in
order
that
the
mere
influence
of
his
presence
near
her
might
induce
her
classmates
to
vote
for
her
and
yet
she
had
not
appeared
particularly
grateful
it
is
the
old
story
with
a
girl
or
a
woman
strange
but
she
never
seems
to
care
for
a
man
s
attention
when
he
makes
a
martyr
of
himself
for
her
sake
however
in
these
last
few
minutes
of
the
dance
the
older
ranch
girls
were
concerned
only
with
thoughts
of
frieda
nowhere
about
the
great
room
could
she
be
seen
not
even
after
the
young
men
guests
had
gone
away
and
the
girls
had
formed
in
line
to
say
to
miss
winthrop
and
jessica
hunt
olive
and
jean
were
separated
by
several
students
and
yet
the
same
questions
traveled
from
one
face
to
the
other
suppose
miss
winthrop
asks
us
what
has
become
of
frieda
what
must
we
say
and
what
will
she
do
if
after
trusting
frieda
and
mollie
they
have
gotten
into
some
kind
of
mischief
two
steps
at
a
time
the
two
girls
when
their
own
had
been
said
and
no
questions
asked
rushed
upstairs
to
their
bedrooms
but
outside
jean
s
door
olive
suddenly
stopped
and
laughed
frieda
is
such
a
baby
she
has
only
gone
upstairs
to
bed
of
course
she
has
said
long
cautiously
they
thrust
open
the
door
a
dim
light
was
burning
inside
the
room
and
a
maid
had
turned
down
frieda
s
bed
but
that
young
lady
was
not
in
it
neither
was
there
any
sign
of
her
presence
about
the
place
jean
slipped
across
the
hall
to
the
johnson
girls
room
lucy
says
mollie
hasn
t
come
upstairs
either
she
reported
immediately
so
what
on
earth
shall
we
do
miss
sterne
has
charge
of
our
floor
and
will
be
around
in
a
few
minutes
to
see
that
we
are
ready
for
bed
then
if
frieda
isn
t
here
won
t
she
just
get
it
jean
was
almost
in
tears
from
nervousness
and
vexation
having
always
tried
to
keep
frieda
a
little
bit
in
order
now
that
frieda
no
longer
paid
any
attention
to
her
she
was
both
angry
and
frightened
i
will
slip
downstairs
and
look
for
her
olive
suggested
faintly
knowing
that
she
could
never
get
downstairs
and
back
again
before
miss
sterne
s
appearance
and
feeling
that
the
vanishment
of
two
girls
might
be
even
more
conspicuous
and
draw
greater
wrath
down
upon
their
heads
than
the
disappearance
of
one
miss
winthrop
or
one
of
the
other
teachers
would
surely
see
you
prowling
around
and
would
have
to
know
the
reason
why
so
that
wouldn
t
help
the
present
situation
jean
answered
surely
frieda
will
be
here
in
a
few
all
up
and
down
the
hall
the
opening
and
shutting
of
bedroom
doors
could
now
be
heard
and
the
voices
of
the
other
girls
bidding
miss
sterne
and
each
other
chapter
ix
frieda
s
mistake
jean
had
on
her
blanket
wrapper
and
had
taken
down
her
hair
but
olive
still
fully
dressed
kept
darting
from
her
own
bedroom
to
jean
s
and
frieda
s
peering
out
both
doors
for
a
sign
of
the
wanderer
finally
jean
turned
to
her
come
on
olive
i
don
t
care
in
the
least
what
miss
winthrop
does
to
frieda
when
she
finds
out
how
she
has
behaved
but
you
and
i
must
go
to
look
for
jean
and
olive
were
out
in
the
hall
where
the
lights
were
now
being
turned
low
when
a
figure
brushed
by
them
please
let
me
get
into
my
own
room
a
voice
said
peevishly
and
nothing
loath
the
three
figures
returned
inside
the
room
begin
undressing
at
once
frieda
ralston
jean
commanded
and
don
t
say
one
word
in
explanation
or
excuse
until
rebecca
sterne
has
gone
by
our
room
for
it
is
just
barely
possible
that
she
may
not
have
seen
you
sneaking
along
the
jean
spoke
in
tones
of
the
utmost
severity
and
even
olive
gazed
upon
the
youngest
ranch
girl
with
an
expression
of
disapproval
the
preceptress
s
knock
came
at
this
very
instant
whatever
are
you
doing
in
your
ball
gown
frieda
miss
sterne
inquired
with
her
head
on
one
side
gazing
about
through
her
large
horn
spectacles
that
olive
had
so
promptly
disliked
like
a
wise
old
owl
and
you
miss
ralston
why
aren
t
you
in
your
own
room
she
continued
you
know
you
are
not
expected
to
enter
another
girl
s
sleeping
apartment
after
the
hour
for
without
replying
olive
promptly
slipped
back
into
her
own
room
and
rapidly
began
making
ready
for
bed
not
returning
to
talk
to
jean
or
to
frieda
even
when
miss
sterne
s
retreating
footsteps
were
far
out
of
hearing
and
only
once
in
the
next
ten
minutes
did
she
understand
what
the
other
two
ranch
girls
were
saying
and
then
it
was
jean
s
tones
that
were
the
more
distinct
frieda
was
quietly
slipping
off
a
pale
blue
silk
stocking
and
slipper
keeping
her
eyes
fastened
conscientiously
on
the
floor
when
jean
now
in
her
night
gown
planted
herself
before
her
where
have
you
been
all
this
time
frieda
ralston
and
why
didn
t
you
and
mollie
johnson
say
to
miss
winthrop
when
the
rest
of
us
did
frieda
looked
up
her
eyes
almost
the
color
of
her
blue
stockings
swimming
in
tears
i
was
in
the
back
hall
jean
and
i
didn
t
dream
of
its
being
so
late
do
you
think
miss
winthrop
noticed
the
culprit
faltered
jean
cruelly
bowed
her
head
what
is
there
that
goes
on
in
this
school
frieda
that
escapes
miss
winthrop
she
inquired
i
suppose
you
will
be
able
to
explain
to
her
in
the
morning
why
you
were
in
the
back
hall
instead
of
in
the
parlor
with
her
guests
as
you
never
seem
to
care
to
tell
anything
to
olive
or
to
me
any
more
please
hurry
to
frieda
was
very
angry
at
jean
s
superior
air
but
her
own
heart
was
quaking
and
her
lips
trembling
so
that
she
could
not
answer
back
in
the
cool
fashion
she
desired
mollie
johnson
was
with
me
she
managed
to
say
and
two
jean
might
have
been
the
late
empress
dowager
of
china
or
the
present
czarina
of
russia
so
majestic
was
her
manner
as
she
sat
up
in
bed
with
her
arms
folded
before
her
i
had
no
idea
you
were
alone
frieda
she
said
firmly
but
will
you
please
tell
me
why
you
went
to
the
back
hall
when
you
knew
perfectly
well
that
miss
winthrop
was
trusting
you
to
behave
like
a
lady
and
remain
in
the
rooms
where
she
was
receiving
her
guests
i
don
t
know
what
ruth
and
jack
will
frieda
began
to
cry
softly
we
were
so
hungry
jean
she
murmured
struggling
to
braid
her
long
locks
of
flaxen
hair
you
see
we
had
only
ices
and
cake
for
the
party
and
about
eleven
o
clock
tom
parker
the
boy
i
was
with
said
he
wished
he
had
a
sandwich
and
i
was
just
as
hungry
for
one
so
we
found
mollie
and
another
boy
and
slipped
out
of
the
dining
room
white
the
housekeeper
was
up
and
back
in
the
pantry
and
she
gave
us
cheese
and
pie
and
all
sorts
of
good
and
now
frieda
s
courage
returning
in
a
small
measure
she
turned
out
the
electric
lights
hopping
into
bed
i
am
not
going
to
be
treated
like
a
criminal
though
jean
bruce
so
i
shan
t
tell
you
anything
more
she
ended
burying
herself
under
the
cover
so
half
an
hour
passed
and
supposedly
the
three
ranch
girls
were
sound
asleep
though
in
reality
the
three
of
them
were
still
wide
awake
jean
and
olive
were
both
worrying
over
frieda
not
yet
understanding
the
real
facts
of
her
escape
and
frieda
was
longing
with
all
her
might
for
some
one
to
sympathize
with
her
and
help
her
in
her
scrape
some
one
who
would
let
her
cry
herself
out
by
and
by
olive
crept
softly
from
her
room
to
jean
s
bedside
jean
has
frieda
explained
things
to
you
she
whispered
jean
sighed
she
said
they
were
hungry
she
and
mollie
and
two
boys
and
that
they
went
into
the
pantry
and
had
something
to
eat
but
she
didn
t
say
why
they
stayed
in
the
back
hall
afterwards
they
couldn
t
have
kept
on
eating
pickles
and
cheese
for
over
an
and
both
girls
giggled
softly
in
spite
of
their
worry
for
was
it
not
like
little
greedy
baby
frieda
to
have
required
extra
food
just
as
she
was
constantly
doing
on
their
long
trip
through
the
yellowstone
the
summer
before
well
it
all
sounds
pretty
simple
jean
olive
comforted
and
i
don
t
think
miss
winthrop
will
be
very
angry
when
she
hears
that
the
pantry
was
the
difficulty
for
she
knows
how
good
the
housekeeper
is
to
all
the
little
it
isn
t
the
pantry
that
worries
me
it
s
the
back
jean
s
voice
became
low
and
impressive
what
do
you
suppose
that
frieda
ralston
could
have
to
talk
about
to
a
stifled
sob
at
this
moment
shook
the
and
both
older
girls
started
guiltily
reaching
over
olive
patted
the
outside
of
the
blanket
were
you
talking
to
the
boy
frieda
she
inquired
in
a
sterner
manner
than
was
usual
to
her
or
were
all
four
of
you
just
sitting
around
having
a
jolly
time
together
now
that
frieda
s
sobs
assured
the
other
two
girls
that
she
was
awake
they
were
glad
enough
to
be
able
to
go
on
with
her
i
was
talking
to
the
boy
all
by
myself
frieda
s
reply
was
unhesitating
though
somewhat
choked
mollie
and
the
other
boy
were
sitting
on
a
higher
step
and
the
servants
were
around
but
no
one
told
us
how
late
it
well
what
were
you
talking
about
that
you
found
so
interesting
that
you
could
not
hear
the
clock
strike
twelve
or
the
home
sweet
home
waltz
or
the
being
said
jean
demanded
fiercely
this
time
frieda
made
not
the
least
effort
to
restrain
her
sorrow
for
the
bed
fairly
shook
with
her
weeping
we
were
talking
about
worms
she
sobbed
worms
olive
and
jean
repeated
in
chorus
believing
that
they
could
not
have
heard
aright
oh
yes
worms
and
flies
the
culprit
continued
you
see
we
got
to
talking
about
fishing
and
tom
parker
said
he
loved
it
better
than
most
anything
he
ever
did
and
some
summers
he
goes
way
up
into
the
maine
woods
and
fishes
in
the
lakes
for
trout
he
uses
flies
for
bait
always
but
i
told
him
that
we
fished
with
worms
in
rainbow
creek
and
sometimes
when
it
wouldn
t
rain
for
a
long
time
we
used
to
have
to
dig
way
down
under
the
ground
to
find
them
i
told
him
too
how
once
i
started
a
fishing
worm
aquarium
and
kept
all
the
worms
i
could
dig
up
in
a
glass
bowl
to
sell
to
jim
and
the
cowboys
whenever
they
wished
to
go
frieda
did
not
further
endeavor
to
outline
her
conversation
with
her
first
admirer
feeling
too
angry
and
too
puzzled
to
go
on
for
the
minute
for
her
former
irate
judges
were
now
holding
their
sides
and
doing
their
level
best
to
keep
from
shrieking
with
laughter
and
i
was
afraid
she
was
talking
sentiment
instead
of
fishing
worms
jean
whispered
in
olive
s
ear
around
to
the
other
side
of
the
bed
olive
went
to
tuck
the
covers
more
closely
about
frieda
go
to
sleep
baby
and
dream
of
jack
she
comforted
and
perhaps
miss
winthrop
will
never
hear
of
your
mistaking
the
time
for
saying
and
if
she
does
hear
you
ll
ask
her
to
forgive
me
frieda
returned
sleepily
for
i
believe
she
likes
you
olive
better
than
most
any
of
the
girls
i
have
seen
her
looking
at
you
so
strangely
every
now
and
in
another
half
minute
frieda
was
fast
asleep
not
feeling
so
penitent
over
her
escapade
as
the
two
older
ranch
girls
supposed
but
frieda
had
always
been
a
good
deal
spoiled
and
as
miss
winthrop
had
not
noticed
her
failure
to
say
no
further
scolding
impressed
her
fault
upon
her
mind
perhaps
this
was
unfortunate
for
it
is
better
that
both
little
girls
and
big
receive
their
punishment
for
a
fault
so
soon
as
the
fault
is
committed
in
order
not
to
keep
on
growing
naughtier
and
naughtier
until
fate
punishes
us
for
many
sins
at
once
chapter
x
the
house
of
memory
after
lunch
the
day
following
the
dance
as
it
chanced
to
be
saturday
afternoon
jean
came
into
the
ranch
girls
sitting
room
looking
for
olive
and
frieda
she
had
been
playing
basketball
for
the
past
two
hours
and
in
spite
of
having
known
nothing
of
the
game
on
her
arrival
at
school
was
already
one
of
its
acknowledged
champions
but
although
jean
s
cheeks
were
glowing
and
her
hair
in
a
tumbled
mass
above
her
face
her
expression
was
uncommonly
serious
and
in
her
hand
she
held
a
bundle
of
letters
one
she
tossed
to
frieda
who
was
curled
up
on
a
sofa
nursing
a
small
cold
due
to
her
frivolity
and
two
to
olive
keeping
two
for
herself
olive
quickly
tore
open
the
letter
addressed
to
her
in
jack
s
handwriting
and
frieda
followed
suit
when
jack
had
first
been
taken
to
the
hospital
and
there
compelled
to
lie
always
flat
on
her
back
her
handwriting
had
been
difficult
to
read
but
now
that
she
had
gotten
used
to
this
method
of
writing
her
stroke
was
again
as
vigorous
and
characteristic
as
of
old
frieda
after
reading
a
few
lines
smiled
up
at
the
other
girls
jack
says
she
is
getting
on
very
well
and
we
are
to
see
her
in
a
few
she
announced
olive
looked
over
at
jean
it
is
worse
than
jack
writes
of
course
isn
t
it
she
asked
i
suppose
ruth
has
written
you
for
jack
never
tells
anything
but
the
best
news
of
there
may
be
an
operation
or
something
of
the
sort
later
on
jean
conceded
ruth
does
not
say
positively
for
it
may
not
be
for
some
months
yet
only
if
the
operation
does
have
to
take
place
jack
has
demanded
that
jim
come
on
from
the
ranch
to
new
york
leaving
ralph
merrit
to
look
after
things
at
the
mine
jim
would
come
now
but
things
are
in
a
bit
of
a
tangle
i
wonder
how
ruth
will
behave
if
jim
does
come
and
jean
sighed
an
interested
expression
crossed
frieda
s
face
why
should
she
behave
in
any
special
way
she
inquired
sitting
straight
up
on
the
couch
to
gaze
from
olive
to
jean
quickly
the
subject
of
conversation
needed
to
be
changed
for
frieda
was
the
only
one
of
the
four
ranch
girls
who
knew
nothing
of
what
had
happened
at
the
ranch
between
jim
colter
their
overseer
and
ruth
drew
their
chaperon
what
had
come
between
the
two
lovers
only
jack
ralston
understood
but
olive
and
jean
were
both
perfectly
aware
that
jim
and
ruth
had
seemed
to
care
a
great
deal
for
one
another
and
then
some
mysterious
misunderstanding
had
suddenly
parted
them
i
wonder
if
old
jack
looks
very
badly
jean
suggested
knowing
this
would
surely
divert
frieda
s
attention
to
one
theme
sometimes
i
wish
for
jack
s
sake
that
we
were
all
back
at
rainbow
lodge
for
there
she
was
able
to
be
out
in
the
air
a
part
of
the
time
and
the
vision
of
jack
lying
helpless
at
the
hospital
was
too
much
for
the
three
girls
so
that
there
was
a
moment
of
painful
silence
in
the
room
then
jean
said
more
cheerfully
after
the
latter
part
of
ruth
s
letter
jim
says
that
ralph
merrit
is
doing
perfectly
splendid
work
at
the
mine
and
that
he
is
a
trump
do
you
know
i
am
rather
vain
of
having
discovered
ralph
that
day
in
the
wilderness
considering
how
well
he
has
turned
out
jim
likes
him
a
lot
better
than
he
does
frank
the
young
lady
on
the
sofa
with
the
cold
had
not
yet
forgiven
jean
for
last
night
s
scolding
now
she
turned
up
her
small
nose
a
trifle
more
than
usual
oh
you
just
say
that
because
ralph
likes
you
best
and
frank
kent
is
more
fond
of
jack
she
answered
scornfully
and
jean
flushed
that
is
not
true
frieda
of
course
it
is
only
natural
that
jim
should
like
ralph
better
because
ralph
is
poor
and
has
to
make
his
own
way
in
the
world
just
as
jim
has
and
frank
kent
though
he
is
awfully
simple
and
a
thorough
good
fellow
is
the
son
of
an
english
lord
and
may
have
a
title
himself
some
then
wouldn
t
it
be
splendid
if
jack
should
become
an
english
lady
and
own
country
estates
and
ride
to
hounds
frieda
suggested
more
peacefully
gazing
across
the
room
at
frank
kent
s
photograph
which
ornamented
the
bookshelf
i
think
i
should
love
to
be
introduced
into
english
society
and
talk
to
earls
and
princes
and
things
she
ended
lamely
a
fine
sarcasm
curled
jean
s
lips
though
her
eyes
sparkled
with
mischief
talk
to
earls
and
princes
and
things
about
fishing
worms
baby
she
queried
with
studied
politeness
and
promptly
frieda
flushing
quite
up
to
her
ears
hurled
a
sofa
cushion
at
jean
which
olive
caught
saying
gently
please
don
t
let
s
quarrel
children
we
never
used
to
at
the
lodge
what
would
ruth
think
of
us
and
picking
up
a
second
letter
that
jean
had
brought
to
her
she
began
to
read
it
jean
sat
penitently
down
on
the
sofa
trying
to
kiss
frieda
who
resolutely
covered
up
her
head
come
on
and
get
dressed
infant
no
your
cold
isn
t
too
bad
for
you
to
come
olive
is
reading
a
note
of
invitation
from
harmon
for
us
to
come
over
to
the
towers
to
have
tea
and
miss
winthrop
and
jessica
hunt
are
to
go
with
but
the
rôle
of
invalid
was
too
precious
a
one
and
too
seldom
enjoyed
by
the
youngest
miss
ralston
for
her
to
surrender
it
easily
i
am
too
sick
please
tell
harmon
she
protested
resolutely
only
if
they
have
any
candy
or
cake
and
happen
to
mention
sending
me
some
you
might
bring
it
along
and
i
do
wish
both
you
girls
would
go
out
for
a
while
for
mollie
is
coming
to
spend
the
afternoon
with
me
after
she
finishes
her
music
lesson
and
we
would
love
to
have
the
sitting
room
to
i
hope
olive
that
you
know
when
you
are
not
wanted
without
being
actually
knocked
over
by
the
broadness
of
the
hint
jean
said
seeing
that
olive
was
hesitating
about
what
she
should
do
come
along
it
will
do
us
both
good
to
get
away
and
not
to
sit
here
thinking
about
what
we
can
t
help
she
ended
while
both
girls
were
putting
on
their
best
afternoon
frocks
preparatory
to
starting
forth
on
their
visit
in
the
silence
of
her
own
room
olive
was
trying
to
persuade
herself
that
her
hesitation
in
going
for
the
call
upon
the
harmons
was
because
she
dreaded
to
be
reminded
by
the
sight
of
elizabeth
of
the
old
tragedy
to
jack
but
there
was
something
more
than
this
in
her
mind
for
actually
she
dreaded
entering
the
big
white
house
which
had
given
her
such
an
uncomfortable
sensation
the
moment
her
eyes
had
rested
upon
it
yet
what
connection
could
she
have
ever
had
with
an
old
place
like
the
towers
or
any
house
resembling
it
her
impression
that
she
must
have
seen
the
house
somewhere
before
was
sheer
madness
for
was
it
not
an
old
dutch
mansion
perhaps
built
hundreds
of
years
ago
and
certainly
wholly
unlike
any
of
the
ranch
houses
out
west
olive
resolutely
put
all
the
ridiculous
ideas
that
had
annoyed
her
out
of
her
mind
and
with
jessica
hunt
miss
winthrop
and
jean
started
gayly
forth
on
their
walk
it
was
about
four
o
clock
in
the
late
november
afternoon
and
instead
of
following
the
path
through
the
woods
the
little
party
set
out
along
the
lane
that
led
through
an
exquisite
part
of
the
sleepy
hollow
neighborhood
crossing
a
little
brook
they
climbed
a
short
hill
and
from
the
top
of
it
could
see
at
some
distance
off
the
spire
of
the
old
sleepy
hollow
church
and
on
the
other
side
the
hudson
river
with
the
autumn
mists
rising
above
it
like
breath
from
its
deep
hidden
lungs
jessica
and
olive
were
together
jean
and
miss
winthrop
as
olive
was
particularly
silent
jessica
drew
her
arm
through
hers
this
is
a
land
of
legends
and
of
dreams
about
here
dear
and
some
day
i
must
take
you
western
girls
about
the
country
and
show
you
the
historic
places
nearby
do
you
know
anything
about
them
she
asked
but
olive
was
dreaming
or
else
stupid
for
she
only
shook
her
head
i
don
t
know
she
answered
the
country
does
seem
somehow
familiar
yet
it
did
not
at
first
don
t
you
believe
that
all
the
world
at
least
the
world
of
outside
things
of
hills
and
trees
and
valleys
and
water
somehow
belongs
alike
to
all
of
us
and
once
we
have
seen
a
landscape
and
moved
about
in
it
why
we
are
at
home
there
isn
t
any
strangeness
in
nature
there
can
t
be
it
is
only
people
and
houses
and
streets
that
are
odd
and
unlike
and
fail
to
belong
to
donald
harmon
met
his
four
guests
some
yards
up
the
road
on
their
approach
to
the
house
as
he
was
holding
a
great
bernard
dog
by
the
collar
and
as
it
bounded
away
from
him
all
of
a
sudden
nearly
upsetting
olive
and
jessica
in
the
rapture
of
its
welcome
the
little
party
entered
the
towers
with
too
much
laughter
and
excitement
for
olive
to
feel
any
or
emotion
indeed
she
quite
forgot
all
of
her
past
foolishness
in
meeting
harmon
and
elizabeth
again
after
so
many
eventful
months
elizabeth
was
able
to
walk
about
the
room
quite
easily
and
of
course
her
first
inquiry
was
for
jack
without
a
chance
for
exchanging
views
jean
and
olive
both
decided
at
once
that
the
drawing
room
at
the
towers
in
spite
of
its
magnificence
was
one
of
the
darkest
and
most
unattractive
rooms
either
of
them
had
ever
seen
for
everything
was
very
stiff
and
formal
and
without
life
or
fragrance
carved
black
furniture
sat
stiffly
against
the
walls
which
were
hung
with
old
portraits
of
men
and
women
in
high
fluted
ruffs
with
gorgeous
embroidered
clothes
and
hard
cold
faces
over
in
one
corner
stood
a
tea
table
piled
with
silver
and
white
linen
and
having
a
large
arm
chair
near
it
carved
like
a
throne
and
behind
this
chair
was
a
portrait
of
a
beautiful
boy
of
ten
or
twelve
who
looked
a
little
like
donald
harmon
my
aunt
will
be
down
in
a
few
minutes
katherine
harmon
had
said
as
soon
as
her
guests
were
seated
she
has
asked
us
to
wait
tea
for
and
jean
and
olive
both
noticed
that
harmon
s
manner
was
a
little
constrained
and
that
she
kept
looking
at
olive
as
though
she
intended
asking
her
some
question
but
as
the
question
was
never
asked
the
girls
must
have
been
mistaken
however
the
conversation
in
the
little
company
did
not
become
general
for
no
one
except
miss
winthrop
seemed
to
feel
at
ease
until
by
and
by
the
tap
tap
tap
of
a
long
stick
was
heard
coming
along
the
hall
and
with
a
low
bow
the
butler
flung
open
the
drawing
room
door
everybody
sat
up
straighter
in
their
chairs
jean
could
not
forbear
a
slight
wink
at
donald
but
olive
felt
her
heart
rise
up
in
her
throat
why
on
earth
was
the
old
mistress
of
the
towers
so
formidable
that
the
entire
neighborhood
felt
an
awe
of
her
olive
was
rather
sorry
that
she
was
competing
for
one
of
her
prizes
offered
to
the
junior
students
at
primrose
hall
madame
van
mater
the
butler
announced
very
distinctly
and
at
the
name
of
the
owner
of
the
white
house
which
olive
now
heard
for
the
first
time
since
her
arrival
at
primrose
hall
the
young
girl
caught
at
the
sides
of
her
chair
and
drew
in
her
breath
sharply
then
when
no
one
was
looking
at
her
smiled
at
herself
and
turned
her
gaze
curiously
on
their
ancient
hostess
chapter
xi
sleepy
hollow
a
land
of
dreams
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
now
beheld
a
lady
for
whom
there
is
no
english
expression
so
good
as
the
french
a
grande
there
was
still
daylight
in
madame
van
mater
s
drawing
room
but
she
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
center
of
her
doorway
staring
with
brilliant
hard
black
eyes
from
one
guest
to
the
other
and
slightly
inclining
her
head
then
she
walked
over
to
the
high
carved
chair
near
the
tea
table
and
sat
down
under
the
picture
of
the
little
boy
feeble
from
old
age
she
was
yet
of
too
determined
a
spirit
to
accept
help
from
any
one
for
when
donald
tried
to
slip
a
cushion
under
her
feet
she
calmly
motioned
it
away
her
hair
which
was
snow
white
was
piled
high
on
her
head
by
a
careful
maid
her
skin
showing
the
remorseless
touch
of
age
was
yet
as
delicately
powdered
and
rouged
as
if
she
had
been
an
actress
about
to
make
her
debut
and
she
was
carefully
dressed
in
a
gown
of
deep
purple
silk
with
lace
at
her
throat
and
old
amethysts
and
yet
no
art
or
effort
could
hide
the
ravages
of
age
and
of
sorrow
in
the
face
though
the
coldness
of
her
air
and
expression
suggested
that
she
would
have
repelled
grief
as
well
as
love
whenever
she
was
humanly
able
the
atmosphere
of
the
old
drawing
room
was
not
any
more
cheerful
after
its
hostess
had
entered
indeed
no
one
in
the
room
seemed
to
be
able
to
speak
except
miss
winthrop
for
harmon
was
plainly
ill
at
ease
and
even
elizabeth
had
been
taught
to
treat
this
wealthy
old
aunt
whose
fortune
she
expected
some
day
to
share
with
her
brother
with
more
respect
than
she
showed
to
any
one
else
in
the
world
unconsciously
the
young
people
including
jessica
hunt
had
huddled
close
together
solemnly
drinking
their
tea
but
having
little
to
say
to
one
another
finally
a
cold
voice
made
the
five
of
them
jump
and
jean
was
barely
able
to
suppress
a
giggle
donald
madame
van
mater
said
bring
the
girl
whom
you
tell
me
you
met
in
the
west
and
who
bears
so
strange
a
resemblance
to
your
mother
closer
to
me
i
think
all
resemblances
are
ridiculous
and
yet
you
have
made
me
why
on
earth
should
olive
be
made
the
center
of
all
eyes
when
of
all
things
she
most
hated
it
and
yet
what
else
was
there
for
her
to
do
in
this
instance
but
to
arise
and
allow
donald
to
lead
her
across
the
room
to
his
aunt
donald
s
eyes
begged
forgiveness
for
the
old
woman
s
peremptory
manner
and
yet
he
showed
no
sign
of
disobedience
turn
on
the
electric
light
madame
van
mater
ordered
for
the
dusk
was
creeping
into
the
big
room
and
under
the
light
facing
her
hostess
olive
waited
with
harmon
only
a
few
feet
away
it
was
unlike
this
shy
delicate
girl
on
meeting
with
strangers
even
to
raise
her
eyes
to
theirs
and
yet
she
now
stared
straight
at
madame
van
mater
with
a
gaze
as
fixed
and
direct
as
hers
and
almost
as
searching
and
haughty
for
olive
s
emotion
was
immediately
one
of
the
deepest
antagonism
toward
this
woman
however
old
she
might
be
who
summoned
her
as
a
queen
might
summon
a
subject
beginning
at
the
girl
s
feet
madame
van
mater
surveyed
her
slowly
through
a
pair
of
lorgnettes
her
eyes
of
course
resting
longest
on
olive
s
face
and
was
the
sigh
she
drew
one
of
relief
as
she
turned
again
to
donald
and
to
harmon
i
do
not
see
the
least
likeness
in
this
girl
to
any
member
of
my
family
she
announced
whatever
her
name
may
be
her
appearance
is
quite
foreign
and
i
should
prefer
never
to
have
the
subject
of
this
resemblance
mentioned
and
nodding
her
head
the
old
lady
apparently
dismissed
olive
to
her
seat
but
miss
winthrop
caught
at
her
pupil
s
hand
as
she
passed
her
drawing
her
down
toward
her
let
me
look
at
you
olive
she
murmured
i
had
not
heard
of
this
fancy
of
donald
s
but
it
has
seemed
to
me
that
i
have
seen
some
one
a
little
like
you
somewhere
i
fancied
in
some
old
then
smiling
she
shook
her
head
no
donald
i
can
t
say
i
see
any
likeness
to
your
mother
and
yet
after
all
perhaps
there
is
enough
of
a
suggestion
of
her
for
you
not
to
be
altogether
and
now
at
last
olive
was
permitted
to
return
to
her
chair
where
she
sat
down
pretending
to
look
out
of
the
window
though
all
the
time
she
was
feeling
hot
and
rebellious
at
the
scene
in
which
she
had
just
been
compelled
to
play
an
unwilling
part
why
because
she
was
so
uncertain
of
her
ancestry
should
she
be
forced
to
go
through
these
moments
that
made
the
fact
more
bitterly
painful
to
her
donald
guessed
at
olive
s
feelings
for
though
the
ranch
girls
had
tried
their
best
to
keep
her
story
from
the
ears
of
the
harmons
during
their
stay
at
rainbow
lodge
a
part
of
it
donald
his
sister
and
mother
had
learned
through
aunt
ellen
through
the
cowboys
on
the
ranch
and
through
one
or
two
of
their
closest
neighbors
and
for
this
reason
the
young
fellow
was
perhaps
even
more
interested
in
this
half
indian
girl
now
he
wished
very
much
to
help
her
escape
from
the
unpleasant
situation
into
which
his
own
idle
talk
had
led
her
donald
turned
to
jean
and
jessica
hunt
i
wonder
if
you
and
miss
ralston
would
care
to
come
and
look
over
the
old
house
with
me
he
asked
it
is
so
old
that
it
is
quite
worth
seeing
and
i
am
sure
that
elizabeth
will
excuse
elizabeth
did
not
pretend
that
she
enjoyed
the
idea
of
being
left
with
only
the
older
people
but
as
jacqueline
ralston
was
the
only
one
of
the
ranch
girls
for
whom
she
deeply
cared
she
made
no
objection
particularly
as
no
one
waited
for
her
to
speak
for
jean
fairly
bounced
from
her
chair
with
relief
jessica
hunt
rose
immediately
and
olive
soon
after
feeling
that
she
would
surely
turn
to
stone
if
she
were
obliged
to
remain
another
moment
in
the
room
with
the
old
mistress
of
the
once
out
in
the
hall
the
party
of
young
people
appeared
suddenly
to
have
been
released
from
prison
jean
danced
a
jessica
clapped
her
hands
softly
together
and
olive
laughed
while
donald
straightway
plunged
head
first
up
the
dark
mahogany
steps
do
come
on
upstairs
he
begged
for
there
isn
t
much
time
and
miss
hunt
knows
the
house
well
enough
to
tell
you
that
it
is
the
tower
room
where
we
have
the
great
view
that
is
most
interesting
please
save
your
breath
for
we
have
rather
a
long
immediately
after
donald
jean
climbed
and
then
olive
and
then
jessica
of
course
the
first
two
flights
of
stairs
were
like
those
in
any
ordinary
house
but
the
third
was
a
queer
spiral
resembling
the
steps
in
a
lighthouse
about
midway
up
these
steps
jessica
noticed
that
olive
paused
pressing
her
hands
to
her
eyes
as
though
to
shut
out
some
idea
or
some
vision
that
assailed
her
and
that
she
wavered
as
though
she
felt
faint
what
is
the
matter
olive
are
you
ill
jessica
inquired
knowing
that
climbing
to
unexpected
heights
often
has
this
effect
on
sensitive
persons
and
though
olive
now
shook
her
head
moving
on
again
jessica
determined
to
watch
her
to
jean
s
openly
expressed
surprise
the
tower
room
was
not
a
small
place
as
she
had
supposed
but
a
big
spacious
apartment
out
of
which
the
little
gabled
windows
winked
like
so
many
friendly
eyes
the
room
was
fitted
up
as
a
boy
s
room
with
a
bed
apparently
just
ready
to
be
slept
in
there
was
a
trapeze
at
one
end
and
a
punching
bag
but
the
bookcases
were
filled
with
books
of
all
kinds
and
for
all
ages
french
spanish
and
german
books
and
plays
from
the
days
of
the
miracle
plays
down
to
the
english
comedies
olive
looked
at
these
books
for
a
long
time
and
then
went
over
to
a
far
corner
of
the
room
which
seemed
to
be
a
small
museum
for
rusty
swords
and
old
pistols
were
hung
on
the
walls
a
shield
and
a
helmet
and
the
complete
figure
of
a
knight
in
armor
stood
in
one
corner
curious
why
these
masculine
trophies
should
interest
a
girl
and
yet
for
some
reason
they
did
interest
olive
for
she
waited
there
alone
jessica
jean
and
donald
having
gone
over
to
one
of
the
windows
were
gazing
out
over
the
countryside
made
famous
the
world
over
through
its
history
and
legend
sleepy
hollow
the
land
of
jean
beckoned
to
olive
come
over
here
dear
if
you
wish
to
see
the
view
she
begged
for
the
sun
will
be
going
down
in
the
next
few
and
in
a
moment
taking
tight
hold
of
jean
s
hand
olive
also
looked
out
the
window
she
saw
the
little
brook
and
a
bit
of
the
bridge
over
which
they
had
lately
passed
with
the
stretch
of
woodlands
to
one
side
and
the
hills
rising
in
the
background
very
quietly
she
began
to
speak
not
far
from
the
village
perhaps
about
two
miles
there
is
a
little
valley
or
rather
lap
of
land
among
high
hills
which
is
one
of
the
quietest
places
in
the
whole
world
a
small
brook
glides
through
it
with
just
murmur
enough
to
lull
one
to
repose
and
the
occasional
whistle
of
a
quail
or
tapping
of
a
woodpecker
is
almost
the
only
sound
that
ever
breaks
in
upon
the
uniform
these
words
olive
repeated
with
her
eyes
still
on
the
landscape
and
her
lips
moving
as
though
she
were
reciting
a
verse
of
poetry
long
ago
forgotten
and
now
brought
back
to
mind
by
the
objects
that
inspired
it
it
was
so
utterly
unlike
olive
to
be
drawing
attention
to
herself
by
reciting
that
jean
stared
at
her
in
blank
amazement
but
neither
donald
harmon
nor
miss
hunt
appeared
in
the
least
surprised
and
after
a
moment
as
though
again
striking
the
strings
of
her
memory
the
young
girl
went
on
if
ever
i
should
wish
for
a
retreat
whither
i
might
steal
from
the
world
and
its
distractions
and
dream
quietly
away
the
remnant
of
a
troubled
life
i
know
of
none
more
promising
than
this
little
and
then
her
recitation
abruptly
ended
what
on
earth
are
you
spouting
olive
ralston
jean
demanded
or
tell
us
please
if
you
are
composing
an
essay
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
to
impress
your
english
teacher
jessica
laughed
ignorant
child
not
to
know
what
olive
is
repeating
i
should
have
taught
it
you
before
now
but
olive
seems
to
have
gotten
ahead
of
me
and
learned
it
but
what
is
it
jean
insisted
the
idea
of
olive
s
memorizing
a
thing
like
that
and
then
waiting
for
a
critical
minute
to
recite
it
so
as
to
impress
her
audience
i
never
should
have
suspected
her
but
as
olive
made
no
answer
to
her
friend
s
teasing
jessica
said
in
explanation
why
olive
has
just
recited
washington
irving
s
description
of
this
countryside
which
he
gives
in
his
legend
of
sleepy
hollow
and
when
you
get
back
to
school
jean
i
advise
you
to
ask
olive
to
lend
you
her
downstairs
the
little
party
broke
up
and
on
the
way
back
to
primrose
hall
olive
walked
close
beside
miss
winthrop
at
first
both
the
woman
and
the
girl
were
silent
but
as
they
neared
the
school
olive
spoke
suddenly
miss
winthrop
i
suppose
most
everybody
in
the
world
knows
the
feeling
of
coming
to
a
strange
place
and
all
at
once
thinking
that
you
have
been
there
before
seen
the
same
things
or
people
and
even
heard
the
same
words
said
miss
winthrop
nodded
trying
to
study
olive
s
face
closely
and
yet
not
appearing
too
deeply
interested
although
the
girl
s
expression
was
both
puzzled
and
intent
why
yes
olive
it
is
a
very
usual
experience
she
answered
no
one
can
understand
or
explain
it
very
well
but
the
impression
is
more
apt
to
come
to
you
when
you
are
young
i
can
recall
once
having
gone
into
a
ballroom
and
there
having
had
some
one
make
a
perfectly
ordinary
speech
to
me
and
yet
i
had
a
sudden
sensation
almost
of
faintness
so
sure
was
i
that
at
some
past
time
i
had
been
in
the
same
place
under
the
same
circumstances
and
heard
the
same
speech
and
yet
i
knew
at
the
time
it
was
but
can
one
remember
actual
words
that
may
have
been
spoken
in
a
certain
place
i
don
t
see
how
a
thing
can
suddenly
pop
into
one
s
mind
without
our
remembering
where
we
have
learned
it
before
olive
persisted
miss
winthrop
took
the
girl
s
hand
in
hers
my
dear
she
said
quietly
i
think
there
are
many
wonderful
things
in
the
world
around
us
that
we
do
not
believe
in
because
we
do
not
yet
understand
them
just
as
long
years
ago
men
and
women
did
not
believe
that
our
world
was
round
because
it
had
not
then
been
revealed
to
them
and
so
i
do
not
understand
about
these
strange
psychical
experiences
about
which
we
have
just
been
talking
but
i
recall
a
remarkable
book
by
du
maurier
one
of
the
most
remarkable
novels
i
have
ever
read
called
peter
in
this
story
there
is
a
song
whose
refrain
is
ever
repeated
in
the
hero
s
mind
from
the
time
he
is
a
little
boy
all
through
his
life
he
does
not
understand
why
he
remembers
this
song
but
by
and
by
it
is
explained
to
the
reader
that
this
song
had
played
an
important
part
in
the
life
of
one
of
peter
ibbetson
s
ancestors
and
just
as
we
can
inherit
the
color
of
our
eyes
the
shape
of
our
nose
a
queer
trait
of
character
from
some
ancestor
so
du
maurier
wrote
that
we
might
inherit
some
mental
impression
like
the
lines
of
this
song
it
is
a
difficult
thing
to
understand
but
the
idea
is
it
is
very
olive
replied
i
think
i
should
like
to
read
the
miss
winthrop
again
turned
to
study
olive
s
face
but
the
darkness
of
the
late
fall
afternoon
had
now
fallen
completely
may
i
ask
if
you
have
had
any
queer
experience
olive
have
you
ever
felt
that
you
have
been
in
a
certain
place
before
where
you
know
you
could
never
really
have
been
or
have
you
thought
suddenly
of
something
that
you
did
not
remember
having
in
your
mind
before
but
please
do
not
answer
me
if
you
would
rather
not
for
i
know
that
these
queer
experiences
most
of
us
would
rather
keep
to
thank
you
was
olive
s
unsatisfactory
answer
as
the
four
women
started
up
the
outside
steps
of
primrose
hall
chapter
xii
winifred
graham
and
gerry
while
jean
and
olive
were
having
tea
at
the
towers
and
frieda
and
mollie
were
engaged
in
a
confidential
talk
in
the
ranch
girls
sitting
room
school
politics
were
playing
an
important
part
in
the
precincts
of
primrose
hall
for
winifred
graham
and
gerry
ferrows
were
devoting
that
same
saturday
afternoon
to
canvassing
their
class
in
order
to
discover
whether
jean
or
winifred
might
hope
in
the
following
week
to
be
elected
president
of
the
junior
class
gerry
was
electioneering
for
jean
while
winifred
was
conducting
a
personal
investigation
indeed
the
situation
between
these
two
girls
was
a
peculiar
and
a
difficult
one
for
having
once
been
intimate
friends
they
had
now
become
violently
estranged
from
one
another
and
yet
continued
to
be
for
no
other
reason
than
because
winifred
suspected
gerry
s
political
intentions
on
that
saturday
afternoon
did
she
arrange
to
bring
her
own
followers
together
and
with
their
aid
to
outclass
gerry
for
jean
had
positively
refused
to
work
for
herself
having
turned
over
her
cause
to
her
two
best
friends
gerry
and
margaret
belknap
but
before
leaving
for
the
towers
very
early
on
that
morning
jean
and
gerry
had
had
a
long
and
intimate
talk
over
the
chances
for
her
election
and
gerry
had
been
perfectly
frank
about
the
whole
situation
olive
was
still
the
obstacle
standing
in
the
way
of
jean
s
success
if
even
at
this
late
date
jean
would
allow
herself
to
be
elected
into
one
of
the
sororities
and
thus
proclaim
her
independence
of
the
girl
whose
presence
in
the
school
her
classmates
resented
she
might
yet
win
their
complete
allegiance
if
it
was
just
this
state
of
the
case
that
gerry
was
trying
to
fathom
for
jean
absolutely
declined
to
turn
her
back
on
her
adopted
sister
and
yet
longed
with
all
her
heart
for
the
honor
of
the
class
presidency
gerry
s
own
position
on
this
question
of
olive
was
an
exceedingly
anomalous
one
while
she
was
too
good
a
sport
to
be
unkind
to
any
one
in
adversity
yet
she
did
not
herself
care
to
associate
with
olive
on
terms
of
perfect
equality
although
she
had
never
mentioned
this
fact
to
jean
and
lately
she
had
felt
her
own
decision
waver
for
since
her
father
had
written
her
that
he
had
charge
of
jack
ralston
s
case
at
his
hospital
and
found
her
the
pluckiest
girl
he
had
ever
seen
gerry
longed
to
take
all
the
ranch
girls
under
her
protection
and
yet
her
prejudice
still
held
out
against
olive
being
but
human
and
entirely
devoted
to
jean
this
prejudice
grew
deeper
on
the
afternoon
that
gerry
went
from
one
room
to
the
other
of
her
classmates
asking
them
whether
they
intended
to
cast
their
votes
for
winifred
or
for
jean
at
the
coming
election
some
of
the
girls
were
quite
frank
they
had
intended
voting
for
jean
but
lately
decided
that
it
would
be
wiser
not
to
have
as
the
representative
of
their
class
a
girl
who
claimed
as
her
adopted
sister
a
indian
others
of
the
juniors
hedged
they
might
or
they
might
not
vote
for
jean
not
having
entirely
made
up
their
minds
between
her
and
winifred
a
number
of
them
were
of
course
jean
s
frank
and
loyal
supporters
and
yet
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
discouragement
that
gerry
at
the
close
of
her
canvass
returned
to
her
own
room
she
had
taken
a
note
book
with
her
and
written
down
each
girl
s
position
in
regard
to
the
election
and
yet
she
could
not
now
decide
whether
jean
s
prospects
were
good
or
bad
so
it
was
peculiarly
irritating
on
bouncing
angrily
into
her
sitting
room
to
find
winifred
already
there
before
her
with
her
long
blonde
hair
down
her
back
and
while
she
was
pretending
to
cut
the
pages
of
a
magazine
wearing
a
particularly
cheerful
and
expression
winifred
graham
was
a
very
beautiful
girl
and
perhaps
not
an
agreeable
one
and
yet
she
represented
a
type
not
unusual
in
a
certain
portion
of
american
society
as
long
as
winifred
could
remember
she
had
been
taught
these
two
things
by
her
brains
and
her
beauty
she
must
some
day
win
for
herself
the
wealth
and
the
position
that
her
family
had
always
longed
to
have
and
yet
never
had
quite
succeeded
in
attaining
for
always
her
mother
and
father
had
been
spending
more
money
than
they
could
afford
in
trying
to
keep
up
with
their
friends
who
were
richer
and
more
prominent
than
themselves
indeed
winifred
s
presence
at
primrose
hall
was
but
another
proof
of
their
extravagance
for
they
could
by
no
means
afford
the
expense
of
such
a
school
yet
their
hope
was
that
there
winifred
would
make
so
many
wealthy
and
aristocratic
friends
that
later
on
they
might
help
her
to
a
wealthy
marriage
but
winifred
was
not
only
ambitious
socially
she
had
a
good
mind
and
longed
to
succeed
in
her
classes
as
well
as
in
her
friendships
so
it
was
hardly
to
be
wondered
at
that
she
should
cordially
dislike
the
two
older
ranch
girls
who
coming
out
of
nowhere
and
pretending
to
nothing
seemed
likely
to
prove
her
rivals
for
while
jean
might
stand
in
the
way
of
her
being
chosen
to
fill
the
highest
position
in
the
junior
class
olive
was
seeking
to
wrest
from
her
the
shakespeare
prize
which
the
old
lady
at
the
towers
offered
each
year
to
the
junior
students
in
jessica
hunt
s
class
gerry
ferrows
was
also
competing
for
this
prize
but
as
it
represented
a
fairly
large
sum
of
money
sufficient
to
cover
a
year
s
tuition
at
primrose
hall
winifred
felt
that
in
any
case
it
must
be
hers
she
looked
up
and
laughed
mockingly
as
gerry
flung
herself
down
on
their
couch
closing
her
eyes
as
though
she
wished
to
take
a
nap
what
luck
for
the
fair
jean
at
the
coming
election
friend
gerry
she
asked
in
an
irritating
fashion
better
luck
than
for
the
fair
winifred
gerry
answered
none
too
truthfully
but
enraged
at
her
companion
s
air
of
calm
assurance
winifred
laughed
again
that
isn
t
the
truth
gerry
and
you
know
it
and
i
thought
you
always
spoke
the
truth
no
matter
if
it
half
killed
you
being
anxious
to
prove
that
women
are
as
honest
as
men
as
brave
and
as
and
as
clever
and
therefore
should
be
entitled
to
equal
gerry
now
sat
up
on
her
couch
challenging
her
foe
her
homely
face
crimsoning
you
are
right
winifred
i
wasn
t
quite
truthful
i
am
afraid
that
your
chance
for
the
presidency
is
better
than
jean
s
but
you
know
that
it
is
all
because
the
girls
here
think
that
olive
isn
t
a
fit
associate
for
the
rest
of
us
or
else
jean
would
have
won
in
a
walkover
i
wonder
if
the
story
of
olive
s
not
knowing
anything
of
her
parentage
is
true
and
if
she
is
a
half
indian
girl
you
told
it
me
where
did
you
get
the
information
perhaps
after
all
it
isn
t
so
oh
the
story
came
through
the
harmons
who
were
out
west
and
heard
the
tale
and
elizabeth
s
repeating
it
to
one
of
the
younger
girls
she
knew
in
this
school
i
don
t
suppose
elizabeth
meant
any
harm
in
telling
for
she
seemed
to
think
that
we
would
be
pleased
to
have
an
indian
enliven
us
at
primrose
hall
you
may
be
very
sure
however
that
olive
and
jean
and
frieda
have
been
very
quiet
about
the
whole
question
of
this
objectionable
olive
but
if
you
don
t
believe
the
story
gerry
why
don
t
you
inquire
of
miss
winthrop
winifred
ended
again
gerry
flushed
i
have
she
answered
shortly
and
miss
winthrop
treated
me
with
her
most
frozen
manner
if
there
is
any
mystery
about
olive
ralston
s
parentage
that
is
her
private
affair
she
said
but
kindly
remember
that
she
is
a
student
at
primrose
hall
and
if
i
thought
her
unfit
for
the
companionship
of
my
other
girls
she
would
not
be
among
you
can
imagine
that
i
felt
about
the
size
of
a
small
caterpillar
when
she
got
through
with
and
gerry
bridled
still
sore
from
miss
winthrop
s
snubbing
you
can
count
on
katherine
winthrop
to
recommend
you
to
mind
your
own
business
winifred
interposed
with
secret
satisfaction
knowing
from
gerry
s
report
that
miss
winthrop
had
heard
of
olive
s
past
and
glad
to
have
the
truth
of
the
story
that
she
had
been
repeating
confirmed
but
don
t
you
think
perhaps
it
is
unkind
to
be
so
unfriendly
to
a
girl
for
something
she
can
not
help
gerry
questioned
not
so
anxious
to
have
winifred
s
opinion
as
to
clear
things
up
in
her
own
mind
winifred
shook
her
head
i
don
t
know
how
you
feel
gerry
but
honestly
i
couldn
t
be
friends
with
an
indian
girl
and
i
don
t
think
she
ought
to
be
in
so
exclusive
a
school
as
primrose
hall
if
miss
winthrop
were
anyone
but
miss
winthrop
i
believe
some
of
the
girls
parents
would
have
complained
of
olive
before
this
but
that
lady
is
just
as
likely
to
fire
us
all
out
and
to
keep
just
this
one
girl
as
she
seems
to
have
such
an
unaccountable
fancy
for
her
look
here
gerry
you
and
i
used
to
be
good
friends
and
jean
bruce
can
t
be
elected
so
why
don
t
you
give
up
working
for
her
and
come
over
to
my
side
and
not
mix
yourself
up
with
this
other
business
you
may
be
sorry
for
it
some
day
and
jean
hasn
t
a
ghost
of
a
gerry
jumped
several
feet
off
her
couch
don
t
you
be
so
sure
winifred
graham
that
jean
bruce
hasn
t
a
chance
for
the
election
and
not
for
anything
would
i
go
back
on
her
now
besides
i
have
a
plan
that
has
just
come
into
my
mind
this
very
second
that
may
straighten
things
out
for
jean
most
chapter
xiii
the
appeal
to
olive
and
gerry
s
plan
was
nothing
more
or
less
than
to
make
a
direct
personal
appeal
to
olive
asking
her
to
aid
in
the
fight
for
jean
by
making
a
sacrifice
of
herself
true
gerry
did
not
know
that
olive
was
as
yet
completely
in
the
dark
about
jean
s
refusal
to
join
the
theta
sorority
because
of
the
failure
of
the
girls
to
include
her
in
the
invitation
but
even
with
this
knowledge
gerry
would
hardly
have
been
deterred
from
her
plan
for
how
could
it
help
olive
to
have
jean
wreck
her
own
chances
on
her
account
nor
how
could
it
alter
her
classmates
attitude
toward
her
the
monday
following
her
talk
with
winifred
gerry
overtook
olive
as
both
girls
were
leaving
their
class
room
and
coming
up
close
behind
her
leaned
over
and
whispered
in
her
ear
oh
olive
i
wonder
if
you
could
have
a
little
talk
with
me
this
afternoon
on
strictly
private
business
i
wish
to
talk
to
you
quite
although
gerry
had
never
been
so
rude
and
cold
to
her
as
some
of
her
other
classmates
at
this
attitude
of
unexpected
intimacy
olive
appeared
surprised
she
had
no
idea
that
gerry
could
be
wishing
to
speak
to
her
of
the
class
election
for
jean
had
carefully
excluded
all
mention
of
this
subject
from
the
conversation
in
their
own
rooms
and
no
one
else
had
seen
fit
to
mention
the
subject
to
olive
oh
certainly
i
shall
be
delighted
to
see
you
at
any
time
olive
nodded
pleased
that
gerry
should
wish
to
be
with
her
alone
why
not
come
up
to
our
sitting
room
right
now
as
our
lessons
are
over
for
the
afternoon
but
with
a
great
appearance
of
secrecy
gerry
shook
her
curly
head
no
i
am
afraid
jean
might
be
bobbing
in
there
at
any
minute
she
confided
and
i
particularly
don
t
want
her
to
know
just
at
present
what
i
wish
to
say
to
suppose
i
ask
miss
hunt
to
let
us
take
a
walk
together
without
any
one
else
olive
next
proposed
i
am
sure
she
half
an
hour
later
the
two
girls
well
away
from
primrose
hall
were
walking
through
the
nearby
woods
and
yet
gerry
had
not
mentioned
the
subject
of
conversation
they
had
come
forth
to
discuss
curious
why
she
should
find
it
difficult
she
was
perfectly
sure
of
having
right
on
her
side
in
this
suggestion
she
was
about
to
make
and
yet
there
was
a
quiet
unconscious
dignity
in
olive
s
manner
that
made
her
companion
a
little
fearful
of
approaching
her
with
advice
or
entreaty
perhaps
it
might
have
been
just
as
well
to
have
laid
this
matter
before
jessica
hunt
or
as
a
last
resort
miss
winthrop
before
forging
ahead
but
gerry
was
an
ardent
suffragette
in
the
making
and
as
she
had
determined
to
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
her
brilliant
father
she
knew
that
indecision
must
never
be
a
characteristic
of
the
new
woman
however
it
was
just
as
well
to
have
this
stranger
girl
recognize
her
entire
friendliness
before
she
made
known
her
mission
having
talked
of
many
things
together
of
their
love
of
the
outdoors
of
jack
s
condition
after
all
it
was
olive
who
at
last
opened
up
the
way
for
her
companion
s
disclosure
i
am
sorry
to
have
talked
so
much
she
said
suddenly
for
i
have
not
yet
given
you
a
chance
to
say
what
you
wished
to
me
what
is
it
and
all
at
once
her
face
flooded
with
color
her
eyes
widened
and
she
looked
at
gerry
with
a
appeal
up
to
this
moment
it
had
not
occurred
to
olive
that
her
classmate
s
desire
for
a
private
interview
with
her
could
have
any
serious
import
but
noticing
gerry
s
hesitation
and
apparent
embarrassment
olive
suddenly
believed
that
she
intended
questioning
her
about
her
past
and
what
could
she
say
ruth
and
jack
had
advised
her
not
to
reveal
her
story
and
yet
if
her
schoolmate
now
asked
her
for
the
truth
she
would
not
lie
gerry
had
always
been
kinder
than
the
other
girls
and
possibly
thinking
the
gossip
about
her
false
her
desire
now
might
be
to
disprove
it
with
a
kind
of
proud
humility
olive
faced
the
girl
whom
she
hoped
for
the
minute
wished
to
be
her
friend
what
is
it
she
asked
again
evasion
was
not
gerry
ferrows
strong
point
do
you
want
jean
to
be
elected
junior
class
president
she
demanded
abruptly
olive
stared
and
then
laughed
happily
well
i
should
say
i
do
rather
she
answered
what
a
funny
thing
for
you
to
ask
me
and
i
am
awfully
grateful
to
you
for
the
help
you
are
giving
jean
for
she
is
awfully
ambitious
and
ruth
and
jack
and
jim
colter
and
all
of
us
would
be
so
proud
of
her
if
she
should
win
after
being
so
short
a
time
at
well
if
you
are
so
anxious
for
her
to
win
why
don
t
you
do
something
to
help
her
instead
of
standing
in
her
way
this
question
was
even
more
blunt
than
the
first
and
it
hurt
because
olive
bit
her
lips
i
help
her
i
stand
in
her
way
she
repeated
stopping
in
her
walk
and
turning
to
face
the
other
girl
squarely
tell
me
please
how
i
can
help
her
and
how
i
stand
in
the
way
of
her
election
at
this
gerry
ferrows
felt
extremely
uncomfortable
still
she
was
not
of
the
kind
to
turn
back
well
you
can
help
jean
a
whole
lot
by
making
her
join
our
theta
sorority
at
once
and
not
hold
back
any
longer
because
you
have
not
been
invited
to
join
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
olive
s
amazement
was
perfectly
genuine
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
jean
isn
t
a
theta
already
with
the
girls
tormenting
her
every
minute
for
weeks
to
come
into
the
society
why
i
thought
that
jean
had
joined
long
ago
and
simply
had
not
mentioned
the
matter
to
me
because
of
not
wishing
to
talk
of
a
thing
that
might
make
me
uncomfortable
i
can
see
now
that
the
girls
may
not
want
a
class
president
who
isn
t
a
member
of
a
sorority
and
also
that
if
jean
stays
out
of
the
societies
because
of
me
it
makes
us
seem
more
like
real
sisters
instead
of
just
a
girl
whom
jean
s
family
is
gerry
nodded
mute
for
once
because
olive
had
put
the
case
too
plainly
for
her
either
to
add
to
it
or
to
contradict
dear
jean
it
is
awfully
good
of
her
and
awfully
foolish
and
just
what
i
should
have
expected
she
went
on
please
understand
that
i
am
very
sorry
both
for
jean
s
and
frieda
s
sakes
that
i
ever
came
with
them
as
a
student
to
primrose
hall
and
i
would
have
gone
away
before
now
only
i
could
not
worry
jacqueline
ralston
who
is
so
ill
or
our
chaperon
ruth
drew
who
must
give
all
her
time
and
thought
to
jack
but
you
see
none
of
us
realized
that
the
girls
at
primrose
hall
would
care
so
much
because
my
birth
and
past
were
so
different
from
theirs
in
the
west
these
things
do
not
count
to
so
great
an
to
her
own
surprise
gerry
ferrows
eyes
which
were
seldom
given
to
this
proceeding
suddenly
filled
with
tears
like
ishmael
of
old
olive
seemed
to
her
to
be
cast
out
into
the
desert
for
a
crime
in
which
she
had
no
part
but
if
this
indian
girl
had
always
been
shy
and
sensitive
in
her
attitude
before
the
hurt
of
her
schoolmates
coldness
toward
her
in
times
past
at
this
moment
her
manner
greatly
changed
perhaps
because
olive
was
so
quiet
and
gentle
it
had
looked
as
though
she
had
no
pride
but
this
is
not
true
for
her
pride
was
of
a
deeper
kind
than
expresses
itself
in
noise
and
protest
it
was
of
that
unconscious
kind
associated
with
high
birth
and
breeding
the
pride
that
suffers
wrong
and
hurt
with
dignity
and
in
silence
now
she
drew
herself
up
facing
her
companion
quietly
her
dark
eyes
quite
steady
her
lips
fixed
in
a
firm
line
and
two
bright
spots
of
color
glowing
in
her
dark
cheeks
i
can
not
tell
you
how
much
i
thank
you
for
telling
me
this
about
jean
she
said
and
please
believe
i
did
not
know
of
it
of
course
you
wish
me
to
make
jean
see
the
foolishness
and
the
utter
uselessness
of
her
sacrifice
of
herself
for
me
and
i
surely
will
i
suppose
you
must
have
wondered
why
i
did
not
do
this
and
still
gerry
continued
to
find
conversation
increasingly
difficult
though
fortunately
olive
was
saying
for
her
the
very
things
she
had
intended
to
say
shyly
gerry
slipped
her
arm
in
fashion
across
olive
s
shoulder
but
the
other
girl
drew
herself
away
not
angrily
in
the
least
but
as
if
she
wished
neither
sympathy
nor
an
apology
do
let
us
go
on
back
to
the
house
at
once
she
suggested
for
i
must
not
waste
any
time
before
i
see
jean
as
the
election
is
to
take
place
so
soon
if
her
connection
with
me
should
make
her
lose
it
i
simply
don
t
know
what
i
should
do
and
forgetting
all
about
the
presence
of
gerry
olive
started
for
home
walking
with
that
peculiar
grace
and
swiftness
which
was
so
marked
a
characteristic
of
her
training
almost
panting
gerry
who
was
herself
exceedingly
athletic
tried
to
keep
up
you
must
not
be
foolish
olive
she
begged
and
you
are
a
brick
whatever
happens
it
can
t
be
your
fault
if
we
girls
at
primrose
hall
are
narrow
and
hateful
and
for
somehow
at
this
late
hour
in
their
acquaintance
gerry
ferrows
had
begun
to
realize
that
whatever
unfortunate
past
olive
ralston
may
have
had
somehow
she
had
managed
to
breathe
a
higher
atmosphere
than
most
other
girls
in
their
first
intimate
talk
together
olive
had
shown
no
anger
against
her
classmates
for
their
cruelty
no
envy
of
jean
s
popularity
or
desire
to
claim
her
allegiance
as
a
defense
against
their
unkindness
no
she
had
only
been
too
anxious
to
sacrifice
herself
to
make
the
way
straight
for
jean
and
at
this
moment
quite
humbly
gerry
would
have
liked
to
have
begged
olive
to
allow
her
to
be
her
friend
only
at
this
time
she
did
not
dare
and
as
they
walked
on
together
in
silence
some
lines
that
she
had
learned
that
morning
in
their
shakespeare
class
in
their
reading
of
the
winter
s
tale
came
suddenly
to
her
mind
nothing
she
does
or
seems
but
smacks
of
something
greater
than
herself
too
noble
for
this
chapter
xiv
to
thine
own
self
be
true
fortunately
the
two
girls
had
not
to
spend
a
minute
in
looking
for
jean
for
no
sooner
had
they
entered
the
front
hall
of
the
school
than
she
was
seen
talking
with
a
group
of
friends
hello
she
cried
pleased
to
find
that
gerry
and
olive
had
been
out
together
for
a
walk
and
grateful
for
what
she
thought
gerry
s
friendliness
to
olive
olive
went
straight
up
to
her
too
much
in
earnest
to
be
abashed
by
the
presence
of
others
come
on
up
to
our
sitting
room
jean
she
begged
for
gerry
and
i
have
something
to
talk
to
you
about
that
must
be
decided
at
it
was
a
pity
that
olive
must
be
in
such
a
hurry
gerry
thought
a
little
impatiently
and
also
a
pity
that
she
had
used
her
name
in
speaking
to
jean
and
plainly
wished
her
to
be
present
at
their
coming
interview
for
there
was
of
course
a
possibility
that
jean
might
be
a
good
deal
vexed
at
her
interference
but
as
jean
left
her
other
friends
immediately
slipping
one
arm
through
olive
s
and
another
through
gerry
s
and
propelling
them
as
rapidly
as
she
could
up
the
broad
stairs
what
was
there
for
gerry
to
do
but
to
surrender
and
let
things
take
their
course
whatever
weighty
problem
there
is
on
your
mind
olive
ralston
that
you
wish
me
to
help
you
solve
jean
exclaimed
gaily
as
they
reached
their
own
door
kindly
remember
that
three
heads
are
better
than
one
even
if
one
is
a
dunce
s
head
else
i
should
never
have
allowed
geraldine
ferrows
to
be
present
at
our
and
giving
each
of
the
girls
an
added
shove
the
three
of
them
plunged
headlong
into
the
sitting
room
frieda
was
not
to
be
seen
but
to
their
surprise
there
before
their
open
fire
jessica
hunt
sat
peacefully
holding
a
large
open
box
of
flowers
on
her
lap
with
her
cheeks
a
good
deal
flushed
possibly
from
the
heat
of
the
fire
i
beg
your
pardon
children
for
having
taken
possession
of
your
apartment
in
this
way
she
explained
but
i
happen
to
have
a
present
for
you
sent
through
my
care
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
surest
way
to
find
you
was
to
wait
at
your
own
hearthstone
until
you
chose
to
while
jessica
was
speaking
she
was
holding
out
the
box
of
flowers
toward
jean
and
olive
mr
drummond
has
sent
you
these
with
a
note
to
me
asking
me
to
see
that
you
get
with
cries
of
delight
the
two
ranch
girls
pouncing
on
the
great
box
which
was
brimful
of
violets
buried
their
noses
in
its
fragrances
they
are
just
too
lovely
and
too
rainbow
ranchy
for
anything
jean
exclaimed
thrusting
a
bunch
into
gerry
s
hand
won
t
frieda
be
homesick
for
her
violet
beds
when
she
sees
them
even
if
she
is
so
enraptured
with
boarding
school
that
she
hardly
talks
of
home
any
more
while
jean
was
speaking
olive
was
busily
lifting
the
flowers
from
the
box
just
toward
the
last
she
discovered
a
separate
bouquet
wrapped
in
white
paper
and
bearing
a
card
with
a
name
inscribed
upon
it
this
is
for
you
miss
hunt
it
has
your
name
upon
it
olive
announced
trying
to
look
entirely
unconscious
although
she
and
jean
both
guessed
at
once
that
the
gift
of
the
large
box
of
flowers
to
them
had
been
made
largely
in
order
to
include
the
smaller
offering
inside
it
jessica
assuming
a
expression
of
complete
indifference
took
the
flowers
they
were
lilies
of
the
valley
encircled
with
violets
and
it
was
difficult
for
any
girl
to
conceal
her
delight
in
them
watching
her
with
her
head
slightly
to
one
side
and
a
dangerously
demure
look
on
her
face
jean
said
suddenly
i
wonder
miss
hunt
how
long
you
have
known
our
drummond
you
see
we
are
awfully
fond
of
him
and
he
has
been
very
good
to
all
of
us
especially
to
jack
sometimes
i
have
wondered
if
he
could
think
you
and
jack
look
a
little
bit
alike
olive
and
i
think
you
do
but
we
don
t
know
anything
about
drummond
except
that
he
is
terribly
rich
and
terribly
good
looking
and
very
kind
can
t
you
tell
us
something
more
jessica
shook
her
head
gravely
i
am
afraid
that
is
all
i
can
tell
you
about
peter
i
mean
drummond
that
is
of
any
importance
just
that
he
is
rich
and
good
looking
and
kind
he
is
so
rich
that
he
has
never
done
anything
or
been
anything
else
and
i
have
known
him
a
great
many
years
since
i
was
a
small
girl
and
he
was
a
big
boy
and
we
used
to
live
near
one
another
in
washington
square
before
my
father
died
and
we
lost
some
of
our
well
jean
returned
reflectively
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
a
good
deal
to
be
just
rich
and
good
looking
and
kind
for
there
are
lots
of
people
who
are
not
one
of
those
three
and
though
jessica
was
not
feeling
especially
happy
at
the
moment
jean
s
words
made
her
smile
that
is
true
dear
she
returned
but
i
am
afraid
that
i
want
a
man
to
be
more
and
to
mean
more
in
this
world
than
just
she
was
about
to
leave
the
room
when
olive
put
her
hand
on
her
arm
don
t
go
jessica
miss
hunt
i
mean
she
apologized
but
i
so
often
think
of
you
as
a
girl
like
the
rest
of
us
i
want
to
talk
to
jean
about
something
and
i
wish
you
to
stay
to
help
me
make
her
behave
still
unsuspicious
of
what
olive
had
in
mind
but
realizing
now
that
it
was
important
else
she
would
not
have
called
in
so
many
persons
to
her
assistance
jean
put
down
her
flowers
and
coming
up
to
her
friend
placed
one
hand
on
each
of
her
shoulders
looking
closely
with
her
own
brown
eyes
into
her
friend
s
darker
ones
out
with
it
olive
ralston
what
on
earth
is
it
that
you
wish
me
to
do
that
requires
so
much
persuasion
and
olive
equally
in
earnest
likewise
put
her
hands
on
jean
s
shoulders
so
that
the
two
girls
made
an
unconscious
picture
illustrating
the
old
proverb
united
we
stand
divided
we
i
want
you
jean
please
not
to
be
a
goose
olive
pleaded
gay
laughter
rang
out
in
response
i
knew
olive
from
the
first
that
you
were
going
to
ask
me
something
i
could
not
grant
jean
returned
plaintively
has
any
one
in
this
world
ever
heard
of
a
goose
who
chose
to
be
one
her
listeners
could
not
help
smiling
but
olive
s
mood
was
too
intense
for
interruption
without
allowing
jean
another
opportunity
for
a
moment
s
speech
she
began
her
request
imploring
her
to
join
the
theta
society
at
once
and
not
to
put
it
off
a
day
longer
than
necessary
for
how
dear
can
you
do
me
the
least
good
by
not
belonging
when
the
girls
want
you
so
much
and
when
if
you
don
t
you
may
lose
your
chance
at
the
junior
election
she
ended
and
who
olive
has
been
telling
you
that
i
am
not
already
a
member
of
the
theta
society
and
that
my
chance
for
the
presidency
will
be
influenced
if
i
am
not
jean
inquired
angrily
although
she
did
not
glance
toward
any
one
for
her
answer
save
olive
but
gerry
ferrows
was
not
in
the
least
a
coward
neither
did
she
feel
in
any
sense
a
traitor
either
to
jean
or
to
olive
so
now
she
moved
quietly
forward
i
told
olive
jean
she
answered
and
you
may
be
angry
with
me
but
i
have
no
intention
of
playing
a
sneak
for
the
life
of
me
i
can
not
see
how
it
will
hurt
olive
for
you
to
join
the
thetas
without
her
and
it
will
hurt
you
very
much
in
your
election
if
you
don
t
olive
is
not
going
to
be
invited
to
become
a
member
if
you
stay
out
and
you
may
lose
the
class
presidency
if
you
are
so
olive
turned
to
jessica
hunt
won
t
you
please
tell
jean
that
gerry
is
perfectly
right
and
that
there
is
no
other
way
of
looking
at
this
matter
she
entreated
she
will
just
break
my
heart
if
she
does
not
and
i
can
t
see
a
bit
of
sense
in
her
i
can
jessica
answered
briefly
but
i
would
rather
not
say
anything
at
all
until
i
have
heard
just
how
jean
feels
about
this
whole
a
grateful
look
was
flashed
at
her
but
jean
moved
first
toward
gerry
i
am
awfully
sorry
i
was
cross
gerry
she
murmured
because
of
course
i
know
you
are
being
good
as
gold
to
me
and
only
acting
for
what
you
believe
to
be
my
good
but
i
don
t
think
either
you
or
olive
in
the
least
understand
my
position
i
am
not
staying
out
of
the
theta
society
for
olive
s
sake
i
am
staying
out
for
my
but
that
can
t
be
possible
both
the
other
girls
urged
gerry
ferrows
jean
said
i
want
you
to
do
me
a
favor
i
want
you
to
think
quietly
of
what
your
opinion
of
another
girl
would
be
leaving
me
out
of
the
case
entirely
if
that
girl
should
win
out
in
a
big
matter
like
a
class
election
by
turning
her
back
on
her
best
friend
and
more
than
her
friend
her
almost
sister
and
you
olive
suppose
you
had
no
part
in
this
business
at
all
or
suppose
you
and
i
had
changed
places
what
would
you
think
of
a
girl
who
would
say
to
another
group
of
girls
yes
thank
you
i
am
very
grateful
indeed
to
you
for
permitting
me
to
enjoy
your
superior
society
even
if
you
do
think
the
people
whom
i
love
and
who
belong
to
my
family
are
not
worthy
of
association
with
you
i
of
course
am
humbly
delighted
to
be
a
renegade
and
a
traitor
if
you
will
just
let
me
play
with
and
jean
s
brown
eyes
were
flashing
and
her
face
was
pale
yet
she
laughed
a
little
at
her
own
fierceness
oh
i
won
t
pretend
that
i
didn
t
think
at
first
of
doing
just
this
thing
that
you
girls
are
begging
me
to
do
she
went
on
and
i
argued
it
all
out
in
my
own
mind
that
i
wouldn
t
hurt
olive
by
joining
the
theta
s
but
i
never
could
persuade
myself
that
such
an
action
would
not
hurt
me
see
here
dear
and
jean
s
usually
merry
lips
were
trembling
as
she
spoke
again
directly
to
olive
how
could
it
injure
you
for
me
to
forget
our
friendship
and
happy
years
together
at
the
ranch
for
wouldn
t
you
still
be
true
and
loyal
and
devoted
to
me
but
poor
little
me
and
what
would
i
be
wouldn
t
i
have
to
live
with
myself
day
time
and
night
time
knowing
exactly
what
kind
of
a
wretch
i
was
no
and
here
jean
struck
a
highly
dramatic
attitude
pretending
to
slip
her
fingers
inside
an
imaginary
coat
in
the
words
of
that
famous
gentleman
whether
henry
clay
or
patrick
henry
or
daniel
webster
i
can
t
remember
i
would
rather
be
right
than
president
bravo
jean
called
jessica
s
voice
from
the
doorway
i
take
off
my
hat
to
you
gerry
olive
please
don
t
argue
this
question
any
further
with
jean
for
she
has
just
said
something
that
we
all
know
to
be
a
fact
to
thine
own
self
be
true
thou
canst
not
then
be
false
to
any
gerry
cleared
her
throat
pulling
at
her
short
hair
rather
like
an
embarrassed
boy
than
a
clever
girl
of
seventeen
all
right
jean
she
conceded
maybe
you
are
right
and
of
course
you
are
if
you
feel
as
you
say
you
do
so
i
shall
not
try
to
make
you
change
your
but
olive
equally
miserable
and
unconvinced
standing
alone
in
the
center
of
the
room
said
to
jean
you
are
dreadfully
good
but
i
don
t
care
what
you
say
i
simply
can
t
allow
you
to
sacrifice
yourself
in
the
way
you
are
doing
for
me
i
must
find
out
how
to
prevent
it
and
i
warn
you
now
that
i
shall
write
to
jack
and
have
her
ask
you
to
change
your
jean
only
laughed
it
would
be
so
like
old
jack
to
ask
a
fellow
to
be
a
poor
sport
she
teased
but
for
goodness
sake
don
t
let
us
talk
about
this
tedious
subject
any
longer
and
do
let
us
put
the
kettle
on
and
all
take
tea
for
i
have
talked
so
much
i
am
nearly
dying
of
around
a
small
table
the
four
girls
placed
themselves
the
ranch
girls
getting
out
their
tins
of
cakes
and
chocolates
kept
for
just
such
occasions
and
nothing
more
of
a
serious
character
was
said
until
they
were
all
comfortably
sipping
their
tea
and
then
jean
turned
to
olive
look
here
olive
i
want
to
ask
gerry
a
question
if
it
won
t
hurt
your
feelings
too
much
and
while
miss
hunt
is
here
with
us
it
seems
to
me
the
best
time
to
ask
it
gerry
of
course
we
have
known
for
some
time
that
there
has
been
some
gossip
about
olive
going
the
rounds
of
the
school
but
we
have
never
known
who
started
it
nor
just
what
the
story
is
would
you
mind
telling
us
instead
of
answering
gerry
hesitated
her
homely
kindly
face
showing
nervousness
and
discomfort
is
the
story
just
that
olive
does
not
know
who
her
parents
are
and
that
we
ranch
girls
found
her
several
years
ago
with
an
indian
woman
and
that
she
may
be
of
part
indian
blood
jean
continued
inexorably
gerry
nodded
her
head
yes
and
the
story
came
originally
through
the
harmons
i
believe
though
they
meant
no
is
that
all
the
tale
or
has
anything
else
been
added
her
questioner
continued
and
gerry
answered
with
her
eyes
on
her
saucer
yes
that
is
then
please
tell
every
girl
at
primrose
hall
that
what
they
have
heard
is
perfectly
true
jean
blazed
although
she
was
trying
to
speak
calmly
i
can
see
now
that
we
have
made
a
mistake
it
would
have
been
better
if
we
had
been
perfectly
candid
about
olive
s
past
from
the
first
there
never
has
been
a
minute
when
we
would
have
minded
telling
it
if
any
one
of
the
girls
had
come
and
asked
us
but
lately
i
have
thought
that
some
extra
story
must
have
been
hatched
up
about
poor
olive
and
joined
to
the
true
one
for
i
simply
couldn
t
believe
that
any
human
beings
could
be
so
horrid
and
so
stupid
as
the
primrose
hall
girls
have
been
to
olive
unless
they
had
been
told
something
perfectly
dreadful
about
her
well
i
don
t
think
i
care
a
snap
about
being
class
president
of
such
a
set
of
girls
jean
added
impolitely
forgetting
one
of
her
guests
olive
ralston
i
don
t
believe
you
are
any
more
an
indian
than
i
am
but
i
want
to
say
just
this
one
more
thing
and
then
i
positively
promise
to
stop
talking
for
my
part
i
would
rather
have
good
red
indian
blood
in
my
veins
than
the
kind
of
thin
white
blood
that
must
run
in
the
veins
of
such
a
horrid
set
of
snobs
gerry
dear
i
do
beg
your
pardon
and
of
course
i
don
t
mean
you
but
if
i
hadn
t
been
allowed
to
speak
this
out
loud
i
should
certainly
have
gerry
s
head
dropped
well
perhaps
i
have
belonged
to
the
snobs
too
jean
she
answered
truthfully
but
if
olive
will
forgive
me
and
make
up
perhaps
some
day
we
may
be
slowly
the
door
now
opened
and
a
languid
figure
clothed
in
a
marvelous
dressing
gown
of
pale
blue
silk
and
lace
with
yellow
hair
piled
high
on
its
head
entered
the
room
what
on
earth
is
jean
preaching
about
the
voice
of
no
other
person
than
the
youngest
miss
ralston
inquired
i
have
just
been
across
the
hall
with
mollie
and
lucy
johnson
and
i
declare
she
has
been
talking
steadily
for
an
jessica
hunt
made
some
laughing
explanation
but
olive
and
jean
could
only
stare
in
amazement
at
frieda
where
on
earth
had
she
gotten
so
marvelous
a
kimono
it
really
looked
like
a
stage
affair
but
at
this
instant
beholding
the
violets
frieda
forgetting
her
manner
for
a
moment
jumped
at
them
aren
t
they
too
she
said
like
the
small
girl
who
once
had
taken
care
of
her
own
violet
beds
at
the
rainbow
lodge
chapter
xv
the
danger
of
wealth
the
truth
of
the
matter
was
that
frieda
ralston
would
have
been
somewhat
happier
and
certainly
a
great
deal
better
off
in
many
respects
could
she
now
have
turned
back
the
pages
of
her
existence
for
a
few
months
and
been
again
that
same
little
girl
who
was
the
beloved
of
every
man
woman
and
child
within
the
thousand
acres
of
the
rainbow
ranch
for
frieda
had
lately
been
getting
into
a
kind
of
mischief
that
is
of
a
serious
nature
whether
practiced
by
a
young
girl
or
by
very
much
older
persons
she
had
been
spending
far
too
much
money
after
the
trip
to
new
york
and
the
purchase
of
the
blue
silk
gown
and
velvet
coat
a
number
of
weeks
before
the
desire
for
beautiful
clothes
awoke
in
frieda
remember
that
she
was
only
a
western
ranch
girl
and
had
never
dreamed
of
such
splendors
as
the
new
york
shops
afforded
neither
did
she
have
any
very
clear
idea
of
the
real
value
of
money
because
gold
had
been
discovered
on
their
ranch
and
because
jack
was
sending
her
fifty
dollars
as
pin
money
each
month
frieda
considered
that
their
wealth
must
be
fabulous
and
so
she
had
contracted
the
very
dangerous
habit
of
buying
whatever
she
wished
without
considering
the
cost
and
the
way
she
managed
to
do
this
was
by
making
bills
earlier
in
the
season
when
the
girls
had
found
it
difficult
to
go
into
town
for
every
little
purchase
it
became
necessary
for
them
to
make
ruth
had
opened
a
charge
account
for
the
three
ranch
girls
at
one
of
the
best
of
the
new
york
shops
but
the
bills
were
expected
to
be
sent
to
the
girls
and
to
be
paid
out
of
their
allowances
jean
and
olive
had
made
only
a
few
necessary
purchases
but
though
no
one
else
knew
of
it
frieda
had
lately
been
buying
with
utter
recklessness
indeed
the
gorgeous
kimono
which
had
just
electrified
the
other
two
ranch
girls
was
only
one
of
a
number
of
articles
that
had
arrived
that
very
afternoon
and
been
delivered
in
the
care
of
mollie
johnson
hanging
up
in
mollie
s
closet
at
the
same
instant
was
an
equally
charming
garment
almost
of
the
same
kind
as
frieda
s
save
that
it
was
pink
and
but
lately
presented
by
frieda
to
her
best
friend
so
it
would
appear
that
even
though
frieda
might
be
keeping
the
letter
of
the
law
in
not
speaking
of
their
wealth
at
primrose
hall
she
was
certainly
not
obeying
it
in
spirit
and
indeed
she
had
broken
her
promise
altogether
on
the
afternoon
when
she
and
mollie
had
been
alone
together
while
olive
and
jean
were
drinking
tea
at
the
not
that
she
had
meant
to
do
this
when
mollie
came
in
far
from
it
the
story
had
just
leaked
out
quite
innocently
at
first
for
frieda
naturally
began
the
conversation
with
her
friend
by
telling
her
that
jean
and
olive
had
gone
to
tea
with
the
harmons
and
then
that
they
had
learned
to
know
the
harmons
because
they
had
rented
their
ranch
to
them
the
summer
before
from
the
ranch
the
speaker
traveled
very
naturally
to
the
yellowstone
and
the
story
of
jack
told
many
times
before
and
coming
back
again
to
the
ranch
ended
with
harmon
s
effort
to
buy
the
rainbow
mine
when
this
word
mine
popped
out
frieda
had
stopped
suddenly
but
it
was
soul
satisfying
to
observe
how
her
friend
mollie
s
eyes
had
grown
wider
and
bigger
with
admiration
and
surprise
at
her
words
why
frieda
ralston
mollie
had
reproached
at
once
you
don
t
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
are
an
heiress
as
well
as
everything
else
that
is
interesting
why
you
have
let
me
think
that
you
were
poor
before
though
i
have
wondered
sometimes
about
the
lovely
things
you
have
been
buying
do
please
tell
me
whether
your
mine
is
copper
or
silver
or
pure
gold
to
frieda
s
credit
it
must
be
stated
that
when
mollie
thus
began
her
very
natural
investigation
of
her
story
she
felt
at
once
both
sorry
and
frightened
it
is
a
secret
mollie
she
began
that
is
i
don
t
see
any
sense
in
its
being
but
i
have
promised
jack
and
jean
and
ruth
drew
not
to
talk
about
our
money
at
primrose
hall
since
we
would
rather
have
our
friends
just
know
us
as
ranch
girls
but
we
really
have
a
gold
mine
do
you
see
why
i
shouldn
t
talk
about
it
earnestly
mollie
shook
her
head
well
i
suppose
i
shouldn
t
so
long
as
i
have
promised
frieda
conceded
but
now
i
have
told
you
of
it
without
meaning
to
i
am
glad
for
i
do
just
want
to
talk
about
it
with
somebody
and
you
are
my
dearest
friend
and
i
wish
you
to
know
everything
about
frieda
might
have
said
that
she
wished
mollie
to
know
all
the
nice
things
about
her
for
it
really
is
not
our
faults
that
we
long
to
pour
into
the
ears
of
our
friends
the
invalid
who
had
been
stretched
on
the
couch
with
a
bad
cold
for
the
past
hour
or
so
now
curled
her
feet
up
under
her
and
rested
her
chin
on
her
hands
want
me
to
tell
you
every
single
thing
about
our
mine
she
demanded
it
is
quite
like
a
fairy
and
of
course
there
is
nobody
in
the
world
and
certainly
not
mollie
johnson
who
does
not
like
to
hear
of
the
finding
of
a
mine
cross
your
heart
and
body
that
you
ll
never
betray
me
say
you
wish
you
may
die
if
you
do
frieda
abjured
and
promising
everything
and
making
all
the
mystic
signs
necessary
to
eternal
secrecy
mollie
then
had
listened
to
the
unfolding
of
the
fairy
tale
frieda
had
not
really
intended
to
make
her
story
a
fairy
tale
but
she
had
no
more
idea
of
how
much
money
the
rainbow
mine
produced
than
a
baby
and
of
course
with
the
telling
of
her
tale
the
size
of
the
nuggets
that
jim
was
getting
out
of
the
mine
each
week
naturally
grew
you
see
frieda
explained
warming
with
her
subject
we
simply
don
t
know
how
rich
we
are
jim
our
overseer
at
the
ranch
who
now
looks
after
our
mine
says
you
never
can
tell
at
first
how
much
a
mine
may
yield
perhaps
we
may
be
millionaires
some
the
word
millionaire
was
an
entirely
new
one
in
frieda
s
vocabulary
which
she
had
learned
since
coming
to
primrose
hall
but
certainly
it
had
a
magnificent
sound
and
made
mollie
blink
it
sounds
just
too
wonderful
the
little
southern
girl
sighed
and
i
do
declare
frieda
that
if
i
didn
t
love
you
more
than
most
anybody
i
should
feel
envious
we
aren
t
rich
a
bit
my
father
is
just
a
lawyer
in
richmond
and
while
we
have
a
pretty
house
and
all
that
why
we
have
some
other
brothers
and
sisters
and
father
says
all
he
can
afford
to
do
is
to
let
lucy
and
me
have
two
years
apiece
at
primrose
hall
he
can
t
give
us
money
for
the
wonderful
clothes
you
buy
won
t
i
be
proud
if
you
can
make
me
a
visit
in
the
christmas
holidays
to
show
you
and
your
lovely
things
to
my
friends
and
mollie
began
twisting
into
curls
the
ends
of
her
frieda
s
yellow
braids
and
looking
up
at
her
with
an
even
increased
admiration
such
a
rush
of
recklessness
and
affection
then
seized
hold
on
the
youngest
miss
ralston
that
without
even
discussing
the
question
with
mollie
she
immediately
arose
from
her
couch
and
rushing
to
her
desk
indited
a
letter
to
a
new
york
firm
asking
that
the
two
kimonos
be
sent
her
at
once
with
slippers
and
stockings
to
match
for
her
beloved
mollie
was
just
too
sweet
and
sympathetic
for
anything
and
quite
unlike
adopted
sisters
and
relations
who
scolded
and
put
on
airs
when
one
s
affairs
went
a
bit
wrong
frieda
would
have
liked
at
the
instant
of
writing
her
letter
to
have
poured
all
her
wealth
at
her
friend
s
feet
but
all
that
she
could
do
more
was
to
invite
her
to
come
into
town
the
next
week
to
be
her
guest
at
the
matinee
and
lunch
and
to
help
her
make
a
few
more
purchases
for
frieda
s
december
bill
had
not
yet
arrived
and
her
check
had
and
so
for
the
time
being
like
many
another
person
she
felt
fairly
well
off
although
her
allowance
for
the
past
two
months
had
melted
away
like
wax
without
her
being
able
to
pay
back
a
single
cent
of
the
money
to
either
jean
or
olive
which
they
had
advanced
to
help
with
her
first
extravagance
the
blue
silk
dress
and
velvet
coat
one
of
the
subjects
that
a
great
many
people
discuss
with
a
good
deal
more
money
at
their
disposal
than
frieda
had
at
present
is
the
way
that
bills
have
of
disappearing
in
new
york
city
so
by
the
time
frieda
had
paid
for
three
tickets
to
the
matinee
as
the
girls
were
of
course
compelled
to
bring
a
chaperon
into
town
with
them
and
three
lunches
at
a
fashionable
restaurant
there
was
so
little
of
her
money
left
out
of
her
original
amount
that
again
she
was
obliged
to
do
some
charging
on
her
account
in
order
to
get
the
few
more
things
that
she
and
mollie
decided
might
be
needed
in
case
she
paid
the
visit
in
richmond
toward
the
close
of
december
on
the
way
back
to
primrose
hall
however
seated
on
the
train
and
feeling
a
bit
weary
frieda
wished
that
she
had
not
spent
this
extra
money
now
she
wouldn
t
be
able
to
pay
her
debts
until
january
and
what
with
christmas
coming
there
would
be
so
many
presents
for
others
that
she
would
wish
to
buy
so
once
frieda
sighed
but
when
mollie
giving
her
a
hug
demanded
to
know
what
worried
her
she
would
not
say
for
how
confess
that
money
matters
were
worrying
her
but
a
few
days
after
the
time
when
she
had
announced
herself
as
an
heiress
of
course
jack
and
ruth
would
see
that
she
was
supplied
with
extra
money
at
christmas
time
if
they
should
consent
to
let
her
make
the
trip
south
and
out
of
this
amount
she
would
certainly
save
enough
to
pay
her
bills
without
having
to
confess
her
extravagances
for
frieda
knew
that
jack
and
ruth
would
both
be
angry
and
ashamed
of
her
for
breaking
her
promise
and
for
buying
things
which
she
did
not
really
need
chapter
xvi
election
day
the
day
for
the
election
of
the
president
of
the
junior
class
had
arrived
at
last
lessons
were
over
at
noon
and
from
three
o
clock
until
six
in
the
afternoon
jessica
hunt
and
miss
sterne
would
remain
in
the
library
at
primrose
hall
watching
over
the
ballot
box
immediately
after
six
the
box
would
be
opened
the
ballots
counted
and
the
choice
of
the
juniors
announced
for
december
had
come
with
her
white
frosts
and
cold
brilliant
days
and
the
fields
about
primrose
hall
were
sere
and
brown
now
and
then
in
the
past
few
weeks
a
light
snow
had
fallen
and
the
shore
waters
of
the
hudson
river
would
then
be
trimmed
with
a
fine
fringe
of
ice
once
the
election
was
over
the
primrose
hall
students
would
be
making
plans
for
the
christmas
holidays
but
until
then
nothing
else
not
even
home
and
family
appeared
of
so
great
importance
do
not
think
because
gerry
s
appeal
to
olive
to
save
jean
had
gone
astray
that
she
had
given
up
the
fight
for
her
friend
s
cause
indeed
like
many
another
brave
campaigner
she
had
only
worked
the
harder
rallying
jean
s
friends
closer
around
her
exhorting
her
enemies
and
trying
to
persuade
the
girls
on
the
fence
that
there
was
no
real
point
in
their
antagonism
toward
olive
and
in
all
the
efforts
gerry
had
made
she
had
had
an
able
lieutenant
in
margaret
belknap
jean
s
other
devoted
friend
for
herself
jean
could
do
little
electioneering
realizing
that
unless
her
classmates
desired
her
to
represent
them
by
reason
of
the
character
she
had
already
established
among
them
nothing
she
could
do
or
say
at
this
late
day
should
influence
them
and
jean
had
also
never
wavered
from
the
attitude
she
had
taken
in
regard
to
olive
on
the
afternoon
of
their
final
discussion
of
the
subject
she
had
not
needed
that
her
resolution
be
strengthened
but
if
she
had
letters
from
ruth
drew
and
jack
ralston
would
certainly
have
accomplished
it
for
olive
true
to
her
threat
had
written
them
the
entire
situation
begging
that
jean
be
persuaded
from
the
error
of
her
ways
instead
of
the
reply
she
hoped
for
ruth
and
jack
had
both
emphatically
declared
jean
s
position
the
only
possible
one
all
the
morning
in
the
hours
just
before
the
election
jean
had
been
conscious
that
olive
s
eyes
were
fixed
on
her
whenever
their
presence
in
one
of
the
class
rooms
made
it
possible
her
expression
was
so
wistful
and
apologetic
that
jean
began
to
care
more
for
her
own
success
on
olive
s
account
than
her
own
so
as
soon
as
luncheon
was
over
and
three
o
clock
had
come
around
slipping
her
arm
through
her
adopted
sister
s
she
drew
her
along
the
hall
toward
the
library
door
come
on
olive
child
and
cast
your
vote
for
me
and
then
let
us
go
upstairs
and
stay
hidden
away
until
the
election
is
over
then
gerry
and
margaret
will
let
us
know
the
result
if
i
were
a
really
person
i
suppose
i
should
now
vote
for
my
rival
miss
graham
but
as
i
can
t
bring
myself
up
to
that
point
i
ll
just
slip
in
a
piece
of
paper
for
old
ten
minutes
after
this
conversation
jean
and
olive
were
in
their
own
sitting
room
for
the
entire
afternoon
having
placed
a
sign
outside
announcing
that
no
one
could
be
admitted
of
course
both
ranch
girls
were
excited
and
nervous
but
of
the
two
olive
was
plainly
the
more
affected
for
while
jean
talked
and
laughed
in
a
perfectly
natural
fashion
she
was
pale
and
silent
and
oftentimes
on
the
verge
of
tears
the
day
was
cold
and
lovely
and
outside
the
sun
shone
on
the
bare
upturned
branches
of
the
trees
and
on
the
broad
bosom
of
the
earth
silly
child
jean
began
arranging
her
paper
and
ink
on
the
writing
table
before
one
of
their
windows
why
should
you
behave
as
though
the
question
of
my
election
was
the
only
important
thing
in
the
world
on
a
day
like
this
i
only
feel
desperately
homesick
for
jack
and
the
old
ranch
what
wouldn
t
i
give
if
we
were
all
there
and
just
starting
out
on
a
long
hard
ride
sometimes
i
am
so
desperate
about
never
seeing
jack
that
i
don
t
know
what
to
do
i
think
i
will
write
to
jim
and
to
ralph
merrit
this
afternoon
for
it
will
help
to
make
the
time
pass
faster
than
anything
else
i
am
afraid
i
have
treated
ralph
rather
badly
as
i
promised
to
write
him
often
and
have
only
written
twice
then
i
want
to
ask
jim
if
he
is
really
coming
east
to
see
how
jack
is
getting
on
i
wonder
if
he
will
hate
to
see
ruth
again
or
like
it
one
never
can
tell
about
a
person
in
perhaps
jean
s
thought
of
her
old
friends
and
affairs
at
the
rainbow
ranch
may
have
had
a
cheering
influence
upon
her
for
no
sooner
had
she
put
her
pen
to
the
paper
than
apparently
all
worry
and
suspense
left
her
and
she
scratched
away
rapidly
and
clearly
for
several
hours
but
poor
olive
found
no
such
distraction
or
solace
indeed
she
kept
up
such
a
restless
and
unnecessary
moving
about
the
room
that
at
any
other
time
jean
most
certainly
would
lave
scolded
first
she
tried
studying
her
shakespeare
since
she
was
making
a
special
effort
to
succeed
in
the
shakespeare
class
and
before
coming
east
to
school
had
read
only
a
few
plays
with
ruth
and
the
ranch
girls
in
the
big
living
room
at
the
lodge
but
not
the
most
thrilling
historic
drama
nor
the
most
delightful
comedy
by
william
shakespeare
could
take
her
mind
from
the
one
idea
that
engrossed
it
after
half
an
hour
of
merely
pretending
to
read
she
flung
her
book
down
on
the
floor
saying
petulantly
tiresome
stuff
i
wonder
what
ever
made
me
think
for
an
instant
i
could
stand
any
chance
of
getting
the
shakespeare
prize
jean
smiled
oh
i
suppose
olive
because
ruth
and
all
of
us
thought
you
had
a
lot
of
talent
for
reciting
and
acting
and
you
dearly
love
to
read
and
study
at
most
times
but
why
don
t
you
go
out
for
a
walk
you
can
find
frieda
somewhere
around
downstairs
and
make
her
go
with
you
i
don
t
want
and
i
don
t
want
to
either
and
won
t
olive
answered
with
a
good
deal
more
temper
than
usual
with
her
and
flying
into
her
own
room
she
banged
the
door
behind
her
rummaging
about
for
some
occupation
she
came
across
a
piece
of
sewing
which
she
had
once
started
at
the
lodge
some
white
silk
cut
in
the
shape
of
a
round
cap
to
be
covered
over
with
small
white
pearl
beads
slipping
back
once
more
into
the
sitting
room
olive
found
a
low
stool
by
the
fire
and
there
tried
to
see
whether
sewing
would
have
a
more
soothing
influence
upon
her
than
reading
for
the
two
more
hours
that
had
somehow
to
be
disposed
of
yes
sewing
on
this
occasion
was
more
distracting
than
reading
for
very
soon
olive
s
fingers
worked
automatically
while
her
brain
began
to
concern
itself
with
interesting
and
puzzling
ideas
the
many
hours
which
she
had
spent
alone
at
primrose
hall
had
not
been
wholly
hours
need
never
be
unless
we
choose
to
make
them
olive
perhaps
had
more
to
think
of
and
to
ponder
over
than
most
girls
of
her
age
who
have
not
led
such
eventful
lives
after
her
afternoon
call
at
the
towers
and
her
conversation
later
with
miss
winthrop
olive
had
been
reading
all
the
books
in
the
school
library
that
she
could
find
which
might
help
her
explain
the
curious
to
no
which
she
had
passed
that
afternoon
but
it
was
not
just
this
one
experience
that
had
puzzled
and
worried
olive
for
many
strange
fancies
impressions
memories
she
knew
not
what
to
call
them
had
been
drifting
into
her
mind
since
her
first
sight
of
that
white
house
on
the
hill
on
the
morning
after
her
arrival
at
tarry
dale
the
ideas
had
no
special
connection
with
anything
that
was
definite
but
olive
was
lately
beginning
to
believe
that
she
could
recall
dim
ideas
and
events
having
no
connection
with
the
years
she
had
spent
in
the
indian
tent
with
old
laska
but
why
had
these
memories
not
assailed
her
in
the
two
years
at
the
rainbow
ranch
perhaps
then
the
recollection
of
laska
of
her
son
josef
who
had
treated
her
with
such
an
odd
mixture
of
respect
and
cruelty
of
the
indian
people
about
her
whom
she
had
so
disliked
had
been
too
close
too
omnipresent
in
her
mind
had
she
needed
to
come
far
away
from
the
west
and
its
associations
to
feel
that
she
had
come
home
no
it
was
impossible
for
olive
felt
sure
that
she
had
never
been
east
before
in
her
life
finally
the
clock
struck
five
and
then
and
at
last
six
jean
some
moments
before
had
ceased
writing
and
now
sat
calmly
folding
up
her
pile
of
letters
placing
them
in
their
respective
envelopes
she
looked
tired
and
perhaps
a
trifle
pale
but
composed
at
last
she
got
up
from
her
chair
and
crossing
the
floor
knelt
down
in
front
of
olive
taking
the
piece
of
sewing
from
her
cold
fingers
olive
dear
she
said
unexpectedly
you
are
looking
positively
ill
from
thinking
of
something
or
other
and
worrying
over
me
for
both
our
sakes
i
wish
that
jack
could
be
with
us
this
afternoon
just
for
the
next
hour
i
know
i
have
not
been
elected
the
junior
president
i
never
have
really
expected
to
be
but
just
as
i
sat
there
writing
about
half
an
hour
ago
i
knew
i
had
not
been
now
see
here
olive
i
have
been
thinking
that
i
have
been
defeated
for
more
than
thirty
minutes
and
yet
look
at
me
do
i
look
heartbroken
or
as
if
i
were
very
deeply
disappointed
and
jean
smiled
quietly
and
serenely
at
her
companion
promise
me
that
when
the
girls
come
in
in
a
few
minutes
to
tell
me
i
have
not
been
elected
that
you
will
take
things
sensibly
and
not
think
that
you
have
had
anything
to
do
with
my
olive
shook
her
head
how
can
i
promise
such
a
thing
jean
when
i
know
perfectly
well
it
isn
t
true
she
answered
vainly
attempting
to
hide
the
fact
that
she
was
trembling
with
excitement
and
that
her
ears
were
strained
forward
to
catch
the
first
noise
of
footsteps
coming
toward
their
door
sighing
jean
continued
oh
you
silly
child
what
shall
i
say
or
do
with
you
don
t
you
know
if
the
girls
had
really
wanted
me
for
president
nothing
and
no
one
could
have
stood
in
my
way
the
shove
which
olive
gave
her
slight
though
it
was
nearly
made
jean
tumble
backwards
why
do
you
talk
as
though
you
knew
positively
you
had
not
been
elected
jean
bruce
when
you
really
know
absolutely
nothing
about
it
i
am
sorry
i
pushed
you
but
i
thought
i
heard
some
one
coming
down
the
as
olive
had
gotten
to
her
feet
jean
now
arose
also
no
one
had
appeared
to
interrupt
them
i
know
by
this
time
that
i
have
not
been
elected
jean
said
because
it
must
now
be
some
little
time
after
six
o
clock
and
miss
sterne
and
jessica
could
never
have
taken
so
long
a
time
as
this
to
count
the
few
ballots
of
the
junior
however
there
was
no
doubt
at
this
instant
of
noises
out
in
the
hall
approaching
nearer
and
nearer
the
ranch
girls
sitting
room
it
was
olive
who
rushed
to
the
door
and
fairly
tore
it
open
while
jean
waited
calmly
in
the
center
of
the
room
outside
were
gerry
and
margaret
belknap
frieda
and
lucy
and
mollie
johnson
and
one
look
at
the
five
faces
told
the
waiting
girls
the
truth
coming
in
margaret
flung
her
arms
about
jean
and
gerry
took
a
farm
clasp
of
olive
s
hand
i
never
would
have
believed
it
in
the
world
she
exclaimed
chapter
xvii
congratulations
by
this
time
the
usually
margaret
was
weeping
bitterly
in
jean
s
arms
while
she
patted
her
reassuringly
on
the
back
gerry
looked
utterly
exhausted
her
hair
was
in
a
perfect
tumble
and
a
smut
ornamented
one
of
her
cheeks
frieda
had
turned
toward
the
wall
and
lucy
and
mollie
johnson
each
had
an
arm
about
her
well
girls
the
game
is
up
isn
t
it
jean
spoke
first
but
olive
simply
would
not
accept
what
her
eyes
had
already
told
her
it
isn
t
true
jean
hasn
t
been
defeated
has
she
gerry
she
entreated
squeezing
the
hand
that
held
hers
winifred
graham
has
just
been
elected
president
of
the
junior
class
at
primrose
hall
for
the
coming
year
gerry
announced
stoically
and
then
there
was
a
sudden
sound
of
weeping
from
all
parts
of
the
sitting
room
why
goodness
gracious
girls
don
t
take
things
like
this
jean
insisted
being
the
only
person
on
the
scene
margaret
dear
you
are
positively
wetting
my
shirtwaist
of
course
i
am
sorry
not
to
have
been
elected
but
i
m
not
disappointed
as
i
haven
t
thought
lately
that
i
could
be
and
please
this
isn
t
anybody
s
then
jean
kissed
margaret
and
walked
over
to
shake
hands
with
gerry
you
have
both
worked
terribly
hard
for
me
and
i
never
can
cease
to
be
grateful
to
you
but
now
that
things
are
all
over
do
let
us
show
the
girls
that
we
can
take
defeat
gracefully
anyhow
please
everybody
stop
crying
at
once
and
come
on
with
me
to
shake
hands
and
offer
my
congratulations
to
winifred
graham
wouldn
t
we
look
a
sorry
set
if
the
next
time
she
beheld
us
we
should
all
appear
to
have
been
washed
away
in
tears
the
first
person
that
looks
cheerful
in
this
room
shall
have
a
box
of
candy
from
me
in
the
of
course
jean
s
suggestion
that
winifred
graham
should
not
learn
the
bitterness
with
which
they
accepted
their
defeat
had
an
immediate
effect
as
she
had
guessed
it
would
upon
gerry
and
margaret
both
girls
stiffened
up
at
once
jean
is
perfectly
right
margaret
immediately
agreed
for
it
will
never
do
in
the
world
for
us
to
make
a
split
in
our
junior
class
just
because
things
have
not
gone
as
we
wanted
lots
of
the
girls
did
vote
for
jean
and
if
we
take
our
defeat
bravely
why
winifred
graham
and
her
set
can
t
crow
over
us
half
so
much
as
if
we
show
our
gerry
made
such
a
funny
face
over
the
prospect
of
winifred
s
crowing
that
everybody
was
able
to
summon
a
faint
laugh
come
on
at
once
then
let
us
go
and
offer
our
congratulations
to
winifred
while
we
have
our
courage
screwed
to
the
sticking
point
for
my
part
i
would
rather
do
my
duty
and
remember
my
manners
without
and
jean
opened
the
door
believing
that
all
her
friends
would
follow
her
once
in
the
hall
however
she
soon
discovered
that
olive
was
missing
and
going
back
called
out
softly
come
on
olive
and
help
us
congratulate
the
winner
you
wouldn
t
have
us
show
an
ugly
spirit
now
would
you
but
olive
quietly
shook
her
head
and
as
jean
was
by
no
means
sure
how
winifred
might
receive
any
attention
from
olive
she
forbore
to
insist
on
her
accompanying
them
should
winifred
be
disagreeable
under
the
present
circumstances
jean
was
not
perfectly
sure
of
being
able
to
keep
cool
and
of
all
things
she
must
not
show
temper
at
the
present
moment
besides
her
few
minutes
conversation
with
olive
before
the
coming
of
the
girls
to
announce
her
defeat
had
evidently
borne
good
fruit
for
olive
did
not
appear
particularly
distressed
at
the
result
of
the
election
after
a
first
moment
of
breaking
down
she
had
entirely
regained
her
truly
jean
was
delighted
at
seeing
her
so
sensible
one
two
three
minutes
passed
after
the
other
girls
departure
and
an
entire
silence
reigned
in
the
room
olive
standing
perfectly
still
had
jean
been
pleased
because
she
had
accepted
her
failure
so
sensibly
sensibly
why
olive
had
not
spoken
simply
because
she
could
not
trust
herself
to
speak
she
had
not
cried
because
in
the
first
moments
of
humiliation
and
regret
there
are
but
few
people
who
can
at
once
summon
tears
of
course
olive
was
taking
the
affair
too
seriously
and
jean
s
view
was
the
only
reasonable
one
but
she
had
not
been
defeated
herself
she
had
stood
in
the
way
of
her
friend
s
victory
and
this
last
blow
had
come
to
her
after
months
of
coldness
and
neglect
on
the
part
of
her
classmates
which
she
had
borne
bravely
and
in
silence
now
olive
was
through
with
courage
and
with
silence
at
last
she
seemed
to
have
made
up
her
mind
to
some
action
for
the
relief
of
tears
came
going
into
her
own
room
olive
flung
herself
face
downward
on
the
bed
giving
herself
up
to
the
luxury
of
this
weakness
when
she
arose
her
face
wore
a
look
of
unusual
determination
whatever
her
fight
it
was
ended
now
first
she
walked
over
to
her
bureau
and
there
unlocking
a
small
iron
safe
took
out
a
sandalwood
box
a
box
which
all
who
have
followed
her
history
know
to
be
the
single
possession
she
had
rescued
from
the
indian
woman
before
running
away
from
her
for
the
last
time
the
girl
carried
her
few
treasures
to
her
desk
and
before
beginning
the
letter
she
plainly
intended
writing
she
picked
them
up
one
by
one
looking
at
them
closely
the
silver
cross
and
chain
worn
on
the
evening
of
the
dance
the
small
book
only
a
few
inches
in
size
and
the
watch
with
the
picture
of
a
woman
s
face
in
it
the
picture
that
ruth
and
the
ranch
girls
had
always
believed
to
look
like
olive
at
the
face
she
looked
longest
but
after
a
few
moments
this
also
was
laid
aside
for
the
work
she
had
in
mind
dear
ruth
her
letter
read
i
write
to
tell
you
that
i
am
not
willing
to
remain
longer
as
a
student
at
primrose
hall
i
am
sorry
to
trouble
you
with
this
news
and
if
jack
is
too
ill
to
be
worried
please
do
not
mention
this
to
her
i
have
tried
very
hard
to
bear
my
difficulties
here
and
truly
i
would
have
gone
on
without
complaining
for
i
can
live
without
the
friendship
of
other
girls
so
long
as
you
and
the
ranch
girls
care
for
me
but
what
i
can
not
bear
is
to
be
a
drawback
to
jean
and
frieda
and
to
stand
in
their
way
as
i
do
here
i
do
not
know
what
to
ask
you
to
do
with
me
for
i
can
not
go
back
to
live
among
the
indians
until
i
know
more
than
i
do
now
and
am
able
to
teach
them
can
i
not
go
to
some
little
school
where
the
girls
will
not
care
so
much
about
my
past
but
if
you
are
not
willing
for
me
to
do
this
and
i
know
how
little
i
am
worthy
of
all
you
and
the
ranch
girls
have
done
for
me
you
must
not
mind
if
i
find
some
work
to
do
so
that
i
can
make
my
living
for
no
matter
what
happens
i
can
remain
no
longer
at
primrose
hall
with
all
love
and
when
the
letter
was
finished
olive
whose
head
was
hot
and
aching
rested
it
for
a
moment
on
the
desk
upon
her
folded
arms
when
she
lifted
it
because
of
a
noise
nearby
miss
katherine
winthrop
was
standing
only
a
few
feet
away
i
beg
your
pardon
i
knocked
at
your
door
olive
but
you
must
have
failed
to
hear
me
and
then
i
came
inside
for
i
wanted
to
talk
to
the
fact
that
miss
katherine
winthrop
in
some
remarkable
fashion
seemed
always
to
know
almost
before
it
happened
every
event
that
transpired
at
primrose
hall
with
the
causes
that
led
to
it
was
well
recognized
by
her
pupils
so
of
course
she
now
knew
not
only
that
winifred
graham
had
been
elected
to
the
junior
class
presidency
but
the
particular
reason
why
jean
had
been
defeated
i
am
sorry
to
have
you
see
that
i
have
been
crying
miss
winthrop
olive
said
knowing
that
there
was
no
use
in
trying
to
disguise
the
truth
i
know
you
think
it
very
foolish
and
stupid
of
miss
winthrop
sat
down
in
a
big
chair
beckoning
the
young
girl
to
a
stool
near
her
feet
well
i
suppose
i
do
usually
discourage
tears
she
answered
with
a
half
smile
at
least
i
know
my
girls
think
i
am
very
unsympathetic
about
them
but
i
suppose
now
and
then
we
women
are
just
obliged
to
weep
being
made
that
way
what
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
is
jean
s
defeat
at
the
election
this
afternoon
you
feel
responsible
for
it
don
t
you
why
be
surprised
at
miss
winthrop
s
knowledge
of
her
feelings
as
apparently
she
knew
everything
so
olive
merely
bowed
her
head
i
want
to
ask
you
to
tear
up
the
letter
which
you
have
just
written
asking
your
friends
to
let
you
leave
primrose
hall
because
of
what
has
miss
winthrop
s
eyes
had
not
apparently
been
turned
for
an
instant
toward
the
desk
on
which
her
letter
lay
and
even
so
she
could
not
have
seen
inside
a
sealed
envelope
olive
stared
almost
gasped
how
could
you
know
miss
winthrop
miss
winthrop
put
her
hand
on
olive
s
dark
hair
so
black
that
it
seemed
to
have
strange
colors
of
its
own
in
it
i
didn
t
know
about
your
letter
dear
i
only
guessed
that
after
the
experience
you
have
passed
through
this
afternoon
with
what
has
gone
before
you
were
almost
sure
to
have
written
it
and
i
want
to
ask
you
to
stay
on
at
primrose
olive
shrank
away
shaking
her
head
quietly
i
have
made
up
my
mind
she
returned
i
have
been
thinking
of
it
before
and
now
i
am
quite
a
moment
s
silence
followed
and
then
in
a
different
voice
as
though
she
were
not
speaking
directly
to
the
girl
before
her
miss
winthrop
went
on
i
believe
there
are
but
three
types
of
people
in
this
world
be
they
men
or
women
that
i
can
not
endure
coward
a
quitter
and
a
snob
unfortunately
i
have
discovered
that
there
are
among
the
girls
here
in
my
school
a
good
many
snobs
i
guessed
it
before
you
ranch
girls
came
to
me
and
now
that
i
have
seen
what
you
have
been
made
to
suffer
i
am
very
sure
but
olive
i
want
you
to
help
me
teach
my
girls
the
weakness
the
ugliness
the
foolishness
of
snobbery
and
can
you
help
me
if
though
not
a
snob
you
are
one
or
both
of
the
other
two
things
i
have
mentioned
a
coward
and
a
quitter
olive
repeated
slowly
wondering
at
the
older
woman
s
choice
of
these
two
words
and
yet
knowing
that
no
others
could
express
her
meaning
so
forcibly
but
i
would
not
be
going
away
on
my
own
account
but
for
the
sake
of
jean
and
frieda
she
defended
i
think
not
you
may
just
now
be
under
that
impression
but
if
you
think
things
over
does
it
not
come
back
at
last
to
you
you
feel
you
have
endured
the
slights
and
coldness
of
your
classmates
without
flinching
and
it
has
hurt
yes
but
not
like
the
hurt
that
comes
to
you
with
the
feeling
that
your
presence
in
the
school
is
reflecting
on
frieda
and
jean
they
do
not
wish
you
to
go
away
olive
they
will
be
deeply
sorry
if
you
do
and
whatever
harm
you
may
think
you
have
done
them
has
already
been
done
and
can
t
be
undone
no
dear
if
you
go
away
from
primrose
hall
now
it
is
because
of
your
own
wounded
feelings
because
your
pride
which
you
hide
way
down
inside
you
has
been
touched
at
last
miss
winthrop
said
nothing
more
but
turned
and
looked
away
from
her
listener
for
olive
was
trying
now
to
face
the
issue
squarely
and
needed
no
further
influence
from
the
outside
by
and
by
she
put
her
small
hand
on
miss
winthrop
s
firm
large
one
i
won
t
go
she
replied
i
believe
i
been
thinking
all
this
time
about
myself
without
knowing
it
you
made
me
think
of
jack
when
you
spoke
of
a
coward
and
a
quitter
for
they
are
the
kind
of
words
she
would
have
been
apt
to
miss
winthrop
laughed
oh
i
have
been
a
girl
in
my
day
too
olive
and
i
haven
t
forgotten
all
i
learned
indeed
i
believe
i
learned
those
two
words
and
what
they
stood
for
from
a
boy
friend
of
mine
long
years
ago
now
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
the
woman
leaned
over
and
putting
her
two
fingers
under
olive
s
sharply
pointed
chin
she
tilted
her
head
back
so
that
she
could
see
in
sharp
outline
every
feature
of
the
girl
s
face
olive
your
friend
miss
drew
told
me
on
bringing
you
here
to
primrose
hall
what
she
and
your
friends
knew
of
your
curious
story
of
their
finding
you
with
an
old
indian
woman
with
whom
you
had
apparently
lived
a
great
many
years
i
believe
that
the
woman
claimed
you
as
her
daughter
but
though
no
one
believed
her
your
western
friends
have
never
made
any
investigation
about
your
past
fearing
that
this
indian
woman
might
again
appear
to
claim
yes
the
girl
gratefully
agreed
well
olive
i
have
seen
a
great
deal
of
the
world
and
very
many
people
in
it
and
since
the
idea
that
you
are
an
indian
worries
you
so
much
i
want
to
assure
you
i
do
not
believe
for
a
moment
you
have
a
trace
of
indian
blood
in
you
except
that
you
have
black
hair
and
your
skin
is
a
little
darker
than
peoples
there
is
nothing
about
you
to
carry
a
remote
suggestion
of
the
indian
race
why
dear
your
features
are
exquisitely
thin
and
fine
your
eyes
are
large
the
idea
is
too
absurd
i
wonder
if
you
could
tell
me
anything
about
yourself
and
if
you
would
like
me
to
try
to
find
out
something
of
your
history
perhaps
i
might
know
better
how
to
go
about
it
than
your
western
for
answer
olive
rose
and
going
over
to
her
desk
returned
with
the
sandalwood
box
containing
her
three
treasures
this
is
all
i
have
of
my
own
she
said
first
putting
the
box
into
miss
winthrop
s
lap
and
then
tearing
up
the
letter
just
written
to
ruth
before
sitting
down
again
on
her
stool
near
the
older
woman
gratefully
she
touched
her
lips
to
miss
winthrop
s
hand
saying
i
would
like
very
much
to
tell
you
all
i
can
recall
about
myself
for
lately
queer
ideas
and
impressions
have
come
to
me
and
i
believe
i
can
remember
a
time
and
people
in
my
life
whom
i
must
have
known
long
before
old
laska
and
the
indian
chapter
xviii
fancies
or
memories
miss
winthrop
nodded
tell
me
everything
you
can
recall
and
keep
back
nothing
for
fear
it
is
not
the
whole
truth
or
that
i
will
not
understand
whoever
your
father
and
mother
may
have
been
you
certainly
have
ancestors
of
whom
you
need
not
be
then
olive
clasping
her
fingers
together
over
her
knee
with
her
eyes
on
the
floor
began
to
speak
and
first
she
told
the
story
of
the
indian
village
and
of
laska
and
how
she
could
not
recall
a
time
when
she
had
not
spoken
english
as
white
people
speak
it
then
of
her
years
at
the
government
school
for
indians
taught
by
a
white
woman
who
had
always
been
her
friend
and
assured
her
that
she
was
not
of
the
same
race
as
the
indian
children
about
her
but
in
proof
of
this
she
had
nothing
save
the
ornaments
in
the
sandalwood
box
which
in
the
interest
of
her
story
miss
winthrop
had
not
yet
examined
yes
and
one
thing
more
olive
could
remember
through
all
the
years
she
had
lived
with
the
indian
woman
there
had
come
to
old
laska
in
the
mail
each
month
a
certain
sum
of
money
large
enough
to
keep
her
and
her
son
in
greater
wealth
and
idleness
than
any
of
the
other
indians
in
the
village
enjoyed
but
from
what
place
this
money
had
come
nor
who
had
sent
it
olive
did
not
know
and
so
to
her
this
fact
did
not
seem
of
great
value
although
miss
winthrop
s
face
had
shown
keen
interest
on
hearing
it
was
there
not
a
postmark
on
the
outside
of
the
letter
olive
she
demanded
clasping
her
fingers
over
her
eyes
in
a
way
she
had
when
puzzled
the
girl
waited
a
moment
why
yes
there
was
she
said
slowly
how
strange
and
stupid
of
me
never
to
have
thought
of
this
before
the
postmark
was
new
york
but
new
york
meant
nothing
to
me
in
those
days
miss
winthrop
except
just
a
name
on
a
map
at
school
you
can
not
guess
how
strange
and
ignorant
i
was
until
the
ranch
girls
found
me
and
began
teaching
me
a
few
things
that
were
not
to
be
found
in
school
books
but
no
one
could
have
sent
money
to
laska
for
me
from
new
york
i
must
have
been
mistaken
and
this
money
did
not
come
for
me
as
i
have
always
hoped
laska
must
have
received
it
for
some
other
and
then
olive
either
from
weariness
or
disappointment
stopped
in
her
narrative
not
as
though
she
had
told
all
that
she
knew
but
because
she
could
not
quite
make
up
her
mind
to
go
on
a
few
moments
of
quiet
waiting
and
then
miss
winthrop
spoke
again
the
money
was
sent
laska
for
your
care
olive
i
am
sure
of
it
but
this
story
of
the
indian
woman
and
your
life
there
you
have
told
to
other
persons
to
the
ranch
girls
and
your
chaperon
miss
drew
what
i
most
wish
you
to
confide
to
me
are
the
ideas
and
impressions
of
the
years
when
you
may
not
always
have
lived
in
the
indian
sadly
the
girl
shook
her
head
miss
winthrop
the
fancies
that
i
have
had
lately
have
been
too
ridiculous
for
me
to
feel
i
can
confide
even
to
you
kind
as
you
are
to
me
for
how
can
it
be
possible
that
a
human
being
can
remember
things
at
one
time
of
their
life
and
not
have
known
them
always
why
since
my
arrival
at
primrose
hall
do
i
seem
to
recall
impressions
that
i
did
not
have
at
the
rainbow
ranch
the
older
woman
did
not
reply
at
once
as
she
was
pondering
over
the
question
just
asked
her
olive
she
returned
slowly
i
believe
i
can
in
a
measure
understand
this
problem
that
troubles
you
half
the
memories
that
we
have
in
the
world
come
through
association
it
is
the
sight
of
an
object
that
recalls
something
in
our
past
which
brings
that
past
back
to
us
now
when
you
were
living
at
the
rainbow
ranch
the
memory
of
your
life
with
laska
the
fear
that
she
might
take
you
away
from
your
friends
was
so
close
to
you
that
you
thought
of
little
else
but
now
you
are
in
an
entirely
different
place
the
fear
of
the
woman
has
gone
from
you
it
is
but
natural
i
think
that
new
and
different
associations
should
bring
to
life
new
memories
what
is
there
that
you
have
been
recalling
in
these
past
few
months
and
still
the
girl
hesitated
it
is
so
absurd
of
me
she
murmured
at
last
but
one
of
my
most
foolish
ideas
is
that
i
have
seen
the
big
white
house
where
madame
van
mater
lives
at
some
time
before
of
course
i
know
i
have
not
seen
it
for
i
have
never
been
in
this
part
of
the
world
before
but
the
other
day
standing
at
the
window
i
suddenly
remembered
a
description
of
the
sleepy
hollow
scenery
which
i
must
have
read
and
learned
long
years
ago
though
i
never
thought
of
it
until
that
miss
winthrop
s
face
was
now
more
puzzled
than
the
speaker
s
by
reason
of
her
deeper
knowledge
of
life
go
on
she
insisted
quietly
can
you
recall
anything
more
about
the
house
and
do
you
think
that
you
ever
saw
madame
van
mater
before
the
other
day
the
strange
note
in
her
questioner
s
voice
was
lost
upon
the
girl
at
her
feet
no
i
never
saw
madame
van
mater
in
my
life
and
i
do
not
like
her
olive
returned
quickly
the
furniture
inside
the
house
did
not
seem
familiar
only
the
outside
and
the
tower
room
and
those
ridiculous
iron
dogs
guarding
the
front
door
but
i
want
to
tell
you
something
that
seems
to
me
course
my
impression
about
madame
van
mater
s
home
is
sheer
madness
what
i
really
can
remember
is
olive
stopped
for
a
moment
as
though
trying
to
be
very
careful
of
only
telling
the
truth
i
remember
that
when
i
was
a
very
little
girl
i
must
have
traveled
about
from
one
place
to
another
a
great
deal
for
i
do
not
think
i
ever
had
a
home
nor
do
i
remember
my
mother
my
father
lately
i
have
believed
i
have
a
real
impression
of
him
and
olive
s
eyes
turned
toward
her
teacher
were
big
with
mystery
and
hope
he
must
have
been
very
tall
or
at
least
he
seemed
so
to
me
then
and
i
went
about
with
him
everywhere
finally
we
came
to
a
place
where
we
stayed
a
much
longer
time
and
there
laska
first
must
have
come
to
take
care
of
us
i
think
now
that
my
father
must
have
died
in
that
place
for
i
can
not
remember
anything
more
of
him
and
ever
afterwards
i
lived
on
with
laska
and
the
indians
that
isn
t
very
much
to
know
and
of
nothing
am
i
perfectly
certain
olive
ended
with
a
sigh
seeing
that
miss
winthrop
had
not
spoken
and
supposing
therefore
that
she
considered
her
idle
fancies
of
little
account
the
older
woman
now
sat
with
one
elbow
on
the
arm
of
her
chair
her
hand
shading
her
eyes
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
catch
the
expression
of
her
face
whatever
idea
had
come
to
her
with
the
hearing
of
her
pupil
s
strange
story
she
did
not
now
mean
to
reveal
it
is
all
very
interesting
olive
she
answered
quietly
and
surely
very
puzzling
so
that
i
am
not
surprised
at
your
putting
but
little
faith
in
your
own
recollections
for
i
can
not
see
any
possible
connection
between
your
travels
in
the
west
as
a
little
child
and
your
idea
that
you
had
seen
some
old
house
like
the
but
there
is
one
person
who
can
tell
us
something
of
your
early
history
without
that
person
is
this
woman
laska
she
kept
you
with
her
all
those
years
for
money
and
probably
pretends
that
you
are
with
her
still
so
that
she
continues
to
receive
the
same
money
each
month
else
she
would
have
made
another
effort
to
get
hold
of
you
well
if
the
love
of
money
has
made
the
indian
woman
keep
your
secret
perhaps
an
offer
of
more
money
will
make
her
tell
it
we
will
not
speak
of
this
olive
dear
to
any
one
in
the
world
at
present
but
i
will
write
to
your
old
teacher
at
the
government
school
in
the
indian
village
and
perhaps
through
her
aid
we
may
reach
this
olive
made
no
answer
for
to
have
expressed
ordinary
thanks
in
the
face
of
so
great
interest
and
kindness
would
have
been
too
inadequate
what
could
she
say
besides
miss
winthrop
was
now
looking
at
her
few
treasures
in
the
sandalwood
box
i
have
seen
your
cross
and
chain
before
she
said
letting
it
slip
through
her
fingers
as
once
more
she
examined
its
curious
workmanship
but
this
little
it
is
written
in
spanish
and
is
a
spanish
prayer
then
for
a
second
time
miss
winthrop
put
her
hand
under
olive
s
chin
studying
the
unusual
outline
of
her
face
i
wonder
if
you
are
a
spanish
girl
child
for
that
would
explain
why
you
are
darker
than
most
americans
and
why
you
have
so
foreign
an
appearance
olive
silently
opening
the
watch
lifted
the
picture
inside
it
to
her
friend
s
gaze
miss
winthrop
looking
at
the
picture
nodded
and
then
began
turning
the
watch
over
in
her
hand
strangely
enough
not
so
deeply
interested
in
the
photograph
as
in
the
watch
itself
this
watch
was
sold
here
in
new
york
olive
and
i
have
seen
one
exactly
like
it
years
her
voice
trembled
a
little
and
she
seemed
fatigued
but
don
t
let
us
talk
of
this
any
more
this
evening
as
it
is
nearly
dinner
time
i
am
going
to
ask
you
to
trust
me
with
these
trinkets
of
yours
as
i
want
to
study
them
more
and
without
another
word
miss
winthrop
quietly
arose
and
left
the
room
chapter
xix
new
year
s
eve
several
weeks
had
passed
since
the
interview
between
olive
and
miss
winthrop
on
the
evening
of
jean
s
defeat
and
now
the
christmas
holidays
at
primrose
hall
were
well
nigh
over
for
twelve
days
save
for
olive
and
its
owner
the
great
house
had
been
empty
of
all
its
other
pupils
and
teachers
now
in
another
hours
they
would
be
returning
to
take
up
their
work
again
the
time
had
been
long
and
lonely
for
olive
of
course
for
jean
and
gone
into
new
york
to
visit
gerry
ferrows
and
margaret
belknap
and
frieda
had
departed
south
with
the
two
johnson
sisters
the
ranch
girls
had
not
wished
to
leave
olive
alone
and
each
one
of
them
had
offered
to
remain
at
school
with
her
but
this
sacrifice
could
hardly
be
accepted
because
olive
had
made
no
friends
who
had
wished
her
to
be
with
them
jessica
hunt
would
have
liked
to
have
had
olive
visit
her
but
she
had
no
home
of
her
own
and
her
sister
s
apartment
was
crowded
with
babies
margaret
and
gerry
who
had
been
kinder
since
their
common
disappointment
had
invited
her
for
week
ends
but
these
invitations
olive
had
quietly
declined
all
she
would
have
cared
for
in
a
trip
to
new
york
was
an
opportunity
to
see
jack
and
this
privilege
was
still
denied
the
ranch
girls
of
course
ruth
had
been
informed
that
olive
was
to
be
left
alone
at
primrose
hall
with
only
miss
winthrop
as
her
companion
during
the
holidays
and
one
afternoon
had
hurried
out
to
see
what
arrangements
could
be
made
for
her
pleasure
however
after
a
serious
half
hour
s
talk
with
miss
winthrop
and
a
shorter
consultation
with
olive
she
had
gone
away
again
content
to
leave
the
fourth
ranch
girl
in
wiser
hands
than
her
own
and
though
the
two
weeks
may
have
been
long
and
lonely
for
olive
yet
they
had
never
been
dull
for
each
moment
she
was
hoping
and
praying
to
hear
some
news
from
old
laska
and
each
hour
being
drawn
into
closer
intimacy
with
miss
winthrop
for
now
that
the
discipline
of
school
life
had
been
relaxed
the
principal
of
primrose
hall
showed
herself
to
her
favorite
pupil
in
a
light
that
would
have
surprised
most
of
her
students
she
was
no
longer
unsympathetic
or
stern
but
treated
olive
with
an
affection
that
was
almost
like
a
mother
s
each
evening
in
her
private
study
before
a
beautiful
open
fire
the
woman
and
girl
would
sit
close
together
under
the
shadow
of
the
winged
victory
reading
aloud
or
talking
of
the
great
world
of
men
and
cities
about
which
miss
winthrop
knew
so
much
and
olive
so
little
but
of
the
secret
of
the
girl
s
past
her
new
friend
did
not
encourage
her
to
talk
for
the
present
if
you
have
told
me
all
you
know
olive
then
it
is
better
for
us
not
to
go
into
this
subject
again
until
we
hear
from
the
indian
woman
and
then
should
she
fail
us
i
must
try
to
think
of
some
other
plan
to
help
and
so
one
by
one
the
holidays
went
by
as
days
will
go
under
every
human
circumstance
and
yet
no
word
had
come
from
laska
though
it
was
now
the
afternoon
of
new
year
s
eve
olive
had
been
alone
all
morning
and
unusually
depressed
for
although
she
had
not
heard
what
she
so
eagerly
waited
to
hear
she
had
learned
that
the
surgeons
had
at
last
decided
an
operation
must
be
performed
on
jack
ruth
had
written
her
that
there
was
supposed
to
be
some
pressure
from
a
broken
bone
on
jack
s
spine
that
made
it
impossible
for
her
to
walk
and
although
the
operation
might
not
be
absolutely
successful
jack
herself
had
insisted
that
it
should
be
tried
the
snow
had
been
falling
all
morning
and
the
neighborhood
of
sleepy
hollow
had
never
been
more
beautiful
not
even
in
its
indian
summer
mists
if
olive
could
go
for
a
walk
she
felt
that
she
might
brace
up
for
certainly
she
did
not
intend
to
let
frieda
and
jean
find
her
in
the
dumps
on
their
return
from
their
holidays
miss
winthrop
would
probably
go
out
with
her
as
she
had
been
attending
to
school
matters
all
morning
seeing
that
the
house
was
made
ready
for
the
return
of
her
students
and
olive
felt
the
fresh
air
might
also
do
her
good
they
had
eaten
lunch
together
but
miss
winthrop
had
not
been
seen
since
while
olive
dispatched
one
of
the
maids
to
look
for
her
friend
she
herself
went
into
the
rooms
where
she
had
been
accustomed
to
find
her
in
the
past
two
weeks
but
neither
in
her
study
nor
in
the
library
nor
in
the
drawing
rooms
could
she
be
found
and
by
and
by
the
maid
came
back
to
tell
olive
that
miss
winthrop
had
gone
out
and
would
probably
not
return
till
tea
time
she
had
left
word
that
olive
must
not
be
lonely
and
that
she
must
entertain
herself
in
any
way
she
desired
well
olive
knew
of
but
one
thing
she
wished
to
do
she
would
go
for
a
walk
and
she
would
go
alone
school
was
not
in
session
so
school
rules
were
no
longer
enforced
and
by
this
time
olive
had
become
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
nearby
neighborhood
instead
of
a
check
which
had
been
jack
s
christmas
present
to
both
jean
and
frieda
in
order
that
they
might
have
their
christmas
visits
to
friend
s
she
had
given
olive
a
brown
fur
coat
and
cap
olive
had
not
worn
them
before
but
now
with
the
snow
falling
and
the
thought
of
jack
in
her
mind
she
put
them
both
on
for
a
minute
she
glanced
at
herself
in
her
mirror
before
leaving
the
house
and
though
her
vanity
was
less
than
most
girls
she
could
not
help
a
slight
thrill
of
pleasure
on
seeing
her
own
reflection
in
the
mirror
somehow
her
new
furs
were
uncommonly
becoming
as
they
are
to
most
people
the
soft
brown
of
the
cap
showed
against
the
darkness
of
her
hair
and
in
her
olive
cheeks
there
was
a
bright
color
which
grew
brighter
the
longer
and
faster
she
trudged
through
the
lightly
falling
snow
olive
did
not
know
the
direction
that
miss
winthrop
had
taken
for
her
walk
but
half
guessed
that
she
must
have
gone
for
a
visit
to
madame
van
mater
as
she
was
in
the
habit
of
calling
on
the
old
lady
every
few
days
and
knew
olive
s
dislike
to
accompanying
her
indeed
she
had
not
been
inside
the
towers
nor
seen
its
mistress
since
her
first
and
only
visit
there
but
now
she
set
off
in
the
direction
of
the
house
hoping
to
find
her
friend
returning
toward
home
the
walk
through
the
woods
olive
s
first
walk
in
the
vicinity
of
primrose
hall
was
now
a
familiar
one
and
less
dark
because
the
trees
had
long
ago
cast
off
their
cloakings
of
leaves
and
were
covered
only
with
the
few
snowflakes
that
clung
to
them
no
man
or
woman
who
has
lived
a
great
deal
out
of
doors
in
their
youth
fails
to
draw
new
strength
and
cheerfulness
from
the
air
and
sunshine
and
olive
who
had
left
school
thinking
only
that
jack
s
operation
might
not
be
successful
and
of
the
pain
her
friend
must
suffer
now
began
to
dwell
on
the
beautiful
possibility
of
her
growing
well
and
strong
as
she
had
been
in
the
old
days
at
the
ranch
and
of
their
being
reunited
there
some
day
not
too
far
off
then
she
had
been
weakly
believing
that
she
would
never
hear
news
of
herself
that
old
laska
was
probably
dead
or
had
disappeared
into
some
other
indian
encampment
now
with
her
blood
running
quickly
in
her
veins
from
the
cold
and
the
snow
she
determined
if
laska
failed
her
to
go
west
the
next
summer
and
try
to
trace
out
her
ancestry
herself
miss
winthrop
ruth
and
the
four
ranch
girls
she
knew
stood
ready
to
help
her
in
anything
she
might
undertake
it
is
a
pretty
good
thing
to
have
friends
even
if
one
is
bare
of
relations
olive
thought
coming
out
of
the
woods
to
the
opening
where
she
could
catch
the
first
glimpse
of
the
big
white
house
i
wish
miss
winthrop
would
come
along
out
of
there
she
said
aloud
after
waiting
a
minute
and
finding
that
standing
still
made
her
shiver
in
spite
of
her
furs
i
wonder
why
i
can
t
get
up
the
courage
to
march
up
to
that
front
door
past
those
two
fierce
iron
dogs
ring
the
bell
and
ask
for
her
i
don
t
have
to
go
into
the
house
and
as
it
is
growing
a
little
late
miss
winthrop
would
probably
prefer
my
not
walking
back
alone
besides
i
want
to
walk
with
like
most
people
with
only
a
few
affections
olive
s
were
very
true
and
deep
and
now
that
she
had
learned
to
care
for
miss
winthrop
she
cared
for
her
with
all
her
heart
slowly
she
approached
the
house
hesitating
once
or
twice
and
looking
up
toward
the
tower
room
as
though
she
were
ashamed
to
recall
her
own
foolishness
on
the
afternoon
of
her
introduction
to
it
there
was
no
one
about
in
the
front
of
the
house
not
a
servant
nor
a
caller
for
a
moment
olive
stopped
smiling
by
one
of
the
big
iron
dogs
that
seemed
to
guard
the
entrance
to
the
old
place
she
brushed
off
a
little
snow
from
the
head
of
one
of
them
and
stooping
patted
it
isn
t
it
silly
of
me
to
think
i
remember
having
seen
you
she
murmured
and
then
olive
s
hand
went
up
swiftly
to
her
own
eyes
and
she
appeared
to
be
brushing
away
something
from
them
as
she
had
brushed
the
snow
from
the
statue
of
a
dog
i
haven
t
seen
you
before
i
have
only
heard
about
you
and
i
haven
t
seen
this
old
house
but
i
have
been
told
about
it
until
i
felt
almost
as
if
i
had
seen
it
she
announced
with
greater
conviction
in
her
tones
than
she
had
ever
used
before
even
to
herself
in
trying
to
recall
the
confused
impressions
of
her
childhood
but
now
instead
of
going
up
the
front
steps
of
the
old
house
and
ringing
the
bell
she
hesitated
and
while
she
waited
the
door
was
suddenly
opened
and
into
the
white
world
outside
miss
winthrop
stepped
with
an
expression
on
her
face
no
one
had
ever
seen
it
wear
of
surprise
and
wonder
anger
and
pleasure
olive
is
it
you
she
said
just
as
if
she
had
expected
to
find
the
girl
waiting
outside
for
her
on
the
doorstep
come
in
to
madame
van
mater
we
have
something
to
tell
illustration
i
suppose
i
can
not
deny
the
proofs
you
have
brought
to
chapter
xx
the
true
history
of
olive
in
the
same
high
carved
chair
that
she
had
used
on
the
afternoon
of
olive
s
first
meeting
with
her
madame
van
mater
now
sat
apparently
waiting
for
someone
for
her
hair
and
complexion
were
as
artistically
arranged
and
she
was
as
carefully
dressed
as
ever
at
the
stranger
girl
s
sudden
entrance
with
miss
winthrop
she
showed
no
marked
surprise
turn
on
the
lights
please
katherine
and
bring
the
girl
close
to
me
she
commanded
in
almost
the
same
tones
that
she
had
used
on
a
former
occasion
and
now
for
the
second
time
olive
found
herself
facing
the
old
lady
and
being
critically
surveyed
by
her
again
with
almost
unconscious
antagonism
their
glances
met
i
suppose
i
can
not
deny
the
proofs
you
have
brought
to
me
katherine
winthrop
that
this
girl
is
my
granddaughter
madame
van
mater
said
coldly
and
i
am
obliged
to
confess
that
her
appearance
is
not
what
i
feared
it
might
be
considering
my
son
s
marriage
however
i
do
not
see
the
least
trace
of
resemblance
in
her
to
any
member
of
my
and
possibly
to
hide
the
trembling
of
her
old
hands
madame
van
mater
now
picked
up
a
number
of
papers
with
which
the
table
in
front
of
her
was
strewn
you
may
sit
down
child
she
remarked
turning
to
olive
and
katherine
winthrop
will
explain
the
extraordinary
circumstance
of
your
connection
with
me
because
i
tried
to
keep
you
as
far
away
from
me
as
possible
fate
has
therefore
brought
you
here
under
my
very
nose
it
has
ever
been
the
way
of
circumstances
to
thwart
not
understanding
in
the
least
what
madame
van
mater
was
talking
about
and
yet
feeling
a
sudden
curious
weakness
in
her
knees
olive
dropped
into
a
chair
which
miss
winthrop
had
at
this
instant
placed
near
her
sit
perfectly
still
a
moment
olive
dear
miss
winthrop
interposed
strange
and
improbable
as
it
may
seem
to
you
to
hear
that
you
are
the
granddaughter
of
madame
van
mater
it
will
not
take
long
for
me
to
explain
the
necessary
facts
to
you
years
ago
your
grandmother
had
an
only
child
a
son
of
whom
she
was
very
proud
and
as
her
husband
had
died
some
time
before
all
her
great
wealth
was
to
be
given
to
this
son
she
hoped
that
some
day
he
would
be
a
great
lawyer
a
statesman
and
that
he
would
make
his
old
family
name
known
all
over
the
world
well
by
and
by
when
this
son
had
grown
up
he
cared
nothing
for
law
or
any
of
the
interests
that
his
mother
wished
and
one
day
announced
to
her
and
to
me
that
he
had
chosen
the
stage
as
his
profession
it
is
not
worth
while
for
me
to
try
to
explain
to
you
what
this
decision
meant
to
his
mother
and
to
me
then
miss
winthrop
continued
but
twenty
years
ago
the
stage
did
not
hold
the
position
in
the
world
that
it
does
and
even
now
there
are
few
mothers
who
would
choose
it
as
the
profession
for
their
only
sons
well
there
were
many
arguments
and
threats
but
as
your
father
was
determined
on
his
own
course
he
went
away
from
this
part
of
the
country
to
the
far
west
and
there
after
several
years
we
learned
that
he
had
married
i
knew
that
your
mother
had
died
soon
after
her
marriage
and
some
years
later
your
father
but
i
was
never
told
that
they
had
left
a
child
only
your
grandmother
of
course
has
always
known
of
your
existence
for
since
your
father
s
death
she
has
been
paying
this
indian
woman
laska
to
have
charge
of
you
the
fact
that
laska
has
now
sent
me
papers
signed
by
your
grandmother
s
own
hand
makes
it
impossible
for
your
relationship
to
be
miss
winthrop
now
paused
for
a
moment
olive
was
not
looking
at
her
but
at
madame
van
mater
you
did
not
wish
to
recognize
me
as
your
granddaughter
because
you
did
not
believe
my
mother
a
lady
she
asked
quietly
precisely
madame
van
mater
agreed
i
see
it
is
all
strangely
clear
to
me
now
i
thought
i
remembered
this
house
because
my
father
had
talked
of
it
so
much
to
me
that
i
really
believed
i
had
seen
it
myself
his
bedroom
in
the
tower
the
old
dogs
at
the
front
door
that
he
used
to
play
with
as
a
child
and
all
the
story
of
sleepy
hollow
well
i
am
sorry
for
your
sake
madame
van
mater
that
miss
winthrop
has
discovered
my
father
s
name
and
people
but
for
my
own
i
am
very
and
olive
s
eyes
turned
toward
the
picture
of
the
boy
on
the
wall
i
suppose
that
when
my
father
was
ill
he
wrote
and
asked
you
to
care
for
me
and
that
is
how
you
came
to
hear
of
laska
she
questioned
and
again
the
old
woman
bowed
her
head
very
quietly
olive
now
got
up
from
her
chair
shall
we
be
going
back
to
school
miss
winthrop
she
inquired
i
believe
i
would
rather
not
stay
here
any
longer
at
in
ten
minutes
the
two
women
the
young
and
the
older
one
were
walking
home
through
the
winter
dusk
together
olive
keeping
a
tight
clutch
of
miss
winthrop
s
arm
for
now
that
she
was
well
away
from
the
towers
and
the
cold
woman
who
was
its
mistress
she
felt
frightened
and
confused
as
though
the
story
she
had
just
heard
was
a
ridiculous
dream
yes
it
is
very
very
strange
miss
winthrop
had
reiterated
over
and
over
again
in
the
course
of
their
walk
but
i
can
not
believe
that
the
queer
accidents
of
life
are
accidents
at
all
i
believe
that
it
has
always
been
intended
that
you
should
some
day
know
your
own
people
and
for
that
reason
you
were
brought
from
your
home
in
the
west
to
this
very
after
a
while
when
olive
had
found
her
voice
she
said
i
do
not
like
my
grandmother
miss
winthrop
and
i
feel
sure
that
we
will
never
like
one
another
but
i
am
very
glad
because
if
she
had
cared
for
me
she
might
have
wished
me
to
leave
the
ranch
girls
and
not
for
all
the
world
can
i
give
up
there
was
another
moment
of
silence
and
then
miss
winthrop
spoke
again
i
cared
for
your
father
once
very
deeply
olive
and
i
have
cared
in
the
same
way
for
no
one
else
since
but
i
also
felt
as
your
grandmother
did
about
the
work
he
chose
to
do
and
so
here
in
the
old
garden
at
primrose
hall
we
said
one
afternoon
for
all
time
i
suppose
my
pride
was
greater
than
my
love
for
him
but
i
have
been
sorry
since
now
i
care
very
much
for
my
old
friend
s
daughter
and
hope
she
will
let
me
be
her
she
has
been
more
than
that
already
olive
returned
fervently
no
one
save
jack
has
ever
been
so
and
then
both
women
talked
only
of
trivial
matters
until
after
dinner
time
that
evening
in
miss
winthrop
s
study
from
eight
o
clock
until
nine
olive
sat
with
her
portfolio
on
her
lap
writing
a
long
letter
to
ruth
drew
disclosing
to
her
the
story
of
the
afternoon
and
asking
her
to
keep
the
discovery
of
the
secret
of
her
ancestry
from
jacqueline
ralston
if
she
felt
it
better
that
jack
be
not
informed
at
present
and
at
her
desk
during
the
same
hour
miss
winthrop
was
also
engaged
in
writing
ruth
carefully
she
set
forth
to
her
how
through
the
efforts
of
olive
s
former
teacher
at
the
government
school
and
by
the
payment
of
a
sum
of
money
which
seemed
very
large
to
the
indian
woman
laska
had
been
induced
to
surrender
certain
papers
proving
that
the
old
mistress
of
the
towers
at
tarry
dale
was
undoubtedly
olive
s
grandmother
though
the
news
had
come
as
an
entire
surprise
to
olive
her
grandmother
was
not
so
wholly
unprepared
for
the
revelation
for
it
seemed
that
harmon
had
known
of
the
existence
of
a
young
girl
the
daughter
of
her
first
cousin
who
was
being
taken
care
of
by
an
indian
woman
somewhere
in
the
state
of
wyoming
on
meeting
olive
at
the
rainbow
ranch
the
summer
before
and
learning
of
her
extraordinary
history
she
had
wondered
if
the
girl
could
have
any
connection
with
her
own
family
although
she
had
not
really
believed
this
possible
knowing
that
olive
had
come
as
a
student
to
primrose
hall
she
had
confided
the
girl
s
story
to
her
aunt
and
olive
s
first
visit
to
the
towers
had
been
of
great
interest
to
both
women
however
madame
van
mater
s
first
survey
of
olive
had
set
her
mind
at
rest
this
girl
whom
donald
believed
to
resemble
his
mother
was
to
her
mind
wholly
unlike
her
neither
could
she
catch
the
faintest
resemblance
to
her
son
who
had
been
supposed
to
be
like
his
cousin
harmon
then
olive
s
quiet
beauty
and
refined
appearance
had
also
satisfied
madame
van
mater
that
this
girl
could
not
be
her
granddaughter
for
she
believed
that
olive
s
mother
had
been
of
too
humble
an
origin
to
have
had
so
lovely
a
daughter
besides
did
not
old
laska
continue
to
receive
the
allowance
sent
her
each
month
for
her
granddaughter
s
care
in
a
few
lines
at
the
close
of
miss
winthrop
s
letter
of
explanation
to
ruth
she
added
the
only
apology
that
could
ever
be
made
for
madame
van
mater
s
behavior
the
proud
old
woman
had
not
understood
how
ignorant
this
indian
woman
laska
was
nor
had
she
dreamed
that
olive
was
being
brought
up
as
an
indian
she
had
simply
told
the
woman
to
continue
as
olive
s
servant
until
such
time
as
the
girl
should
reach
the
age
of
when
she
intended
settling
a
certain
sum
of
money
upon
her
she
had
not
wished
that
this
child
of
her
son
s
should
suffer
only
that
she
should
not
be
troubled
with
her
nor
compelled
to
recognize
her
as
her
heiress
and
the
bearer
of
her
name
by
and
by
however
both
olive
and
miss
winthrop
grew
weary
of
their
long
letter
writing
and
olive
coming
across
the
room
placed
herself
on
a
low
stool
near
her
companion
resting
her
chin
on
her
hands
in
a
fashion
she
had
when
interested
both
women
talked
of
her
father
they
could
recall
his
reading
aloud
to
them
hour
after
hour
and
olive
believed
that
she
must
have
learned
by
rote
washington
irving
s
description
of
sleepy
hollow
valley
when
she
was
only
a
tiny
girl
and
that
her
first
look
out
of
her
father
s
bedroom
window
had
suddenly
brought
the
lines
back
to
her
recollection
till
a
little
before
midnight
there
were
questions
to
be
asked
and
answered
between
the
two
friends
but
just
as
the
old
year
was
dying
with
the
twelve
strokes
of
the
clock
in
the
hall
olive
said
good
night
she
was
half
way
out
the
door
when
she
turned
back
again
and
miss
winthrop
could
see
by
the
color
in
her
cheeks
that
there
was
still
another
question
she
wished
to
ask
do
you
think
she
asked
finally
that
my
mother
could
have
been
such
a
dreadful
person
i
do
not
think
i
ever
saw
a
lovelier
face
than
her
picture
in
my
father
s
miss
winthrop
looked
closely
at
olive
remembering
how
her
strange
and
foreign
beauty
had
always
interested
her
no
my
dear
your
mother
could
most
certainly
not
have
been
dreadful
she
answered
i
think
i
heard
that
she
was
a
spanish
girl
and
these
curios
you
have
and
your
own
appearance
make
me
feel
assured
of
the
fact
it
was
because
your
grandmother
was
informed
that
your
mother
was
a
singer
or
an
actress
that
she
felt
so
deep
a
prejudice
against
her
but
the
real
truth
is
that
she
never
forgave
her
son
and
wished
never
to
hear
his
name
mentioned
as
long
as
she
with
a
little
shiver
at
the
thought
of
such
a
nature
as
the
old
woman
s
at
the
towers
olive
went
on
up
to
her
own
room
to
bed
chapter
xxi
jean
and
frieda
return
to
primrose
hall
in
less
than
hours
after
the
close
of
the
last
chapter
primrose
hall
was
once
more
emptied
of
its
silences
and
loneliness
and
gay
with
the
returning
of
its
students
now
that
the
holiday
season
was
well
past
most
of
the
girls
came
back
in
groups
of
twos
and
threes
since
trains
at
tarrydale
were
numerous
but
every
now
and
then
the
school
carryall
would
be
loaded
up
with
girls
hanging
on
to
the
steps
sitting
in
one
another
s
laps
and
it
happened
that
in
one
of
these
overloaded
parties
jean
and
frieda
arrived
at
primrose
hall
together
there
was
so
much
excitement
of
course
in
the
arrival
of
such
a
number
of
students
at
one
time
and
so
much
kissing
and
embracing
among
some
of
the
girls
tragically
separated
from
their
best
chums
for
two
weeks
that
in
the
general
hubbub
jean
and
frieda
noticed
no
special
change
in
olive
if
jean
thought
at
first
that
she
had
looked
a
little
tired
she
forgot
about
it
in
a
few
minutes
the
girls
had
so
many
stories
to
tell
of
their
own
experiences
there
was
so
much
running
back
and
forth
from
one
room
to
the
other
so
much
unpacking
of
trunks
and
bestowing
of
forgotten
gifts
that
the
three
ranch
girls
really
saw
very
little
of
each
other
without
outside
friends
being
present
until
almost
bedtime
that
night
then
at
nine
o
clock
with
only
an
hour
to
spare
before
their
lights
were
turned
out
they
met
before
their
fire
wearing
their
kimonos
their
hair
down
their
backs
prepared
at
last
for
the
confidential
talk
to
which
for
different
reasons
they
had
all
been
looking
forward
for
some
time
a
sign
with
no
admittance
printed
on
it
hung
outside
their
door
and
on
the
floor
in
convenient
reach
of
the
three
girls
sat
two
large
boxes
of
candy
one
presented
to
frieda
upon
leaving
richmond
and
the
other
a
farewell
gift
to
jean
from
cecil
belknap
in
new
york
for
the
first
moment
so
great
was
the
satisfaction
of
the
three
girls
at
being
reunited
that
nobody
spoke
and
then
all
at
once
they
began
talking
in
chorus
i
think
i
ought
to
have
the
first
chance
to
tell
things
as
i
am
the
youngest
and
have
been
the
farthest
away
frieda
protested
of
course
jean
and
olive
were
glad
enough
to
give
frieda
the
first
chance
but
now
as
she
began
to
speak
very
naturally
both
of
them
turned
their
attention
full
upon
her
it
was
strange
for
of
course
frieda
had
had
a
wonderful
girl
in
a
southern
city
fails
to
yet
in
spite
of
all
her
accounts
of
dances
and
dinner
parties
and
germans
given
for
the
school
girls
in
richmond
during
the
holidays
both
jean
and
olive
noticed
that
she
did
not
look
as
cheerful
as
usual
but
that
if
it
were
possible
to
believe
such
a
thing
a
fine
line
of
worry
appeared
to
pucker
her
brow
frieda
ralston
you
have
been
going
too
hard
and
seeing
altogether
too
much
of
life
for
such
a
baby
jean
insisted
when
frieda
had
triumphantly
cast
a
dozen
or
more
pretty
trinkets
received
as
favors
at
germans
at
their
feet
but
frieda
had
only
obstinately
shaken
her
head
i
haven
t
either
jean
she
declared
mrs
johnson
says
it
does
not
hurt
girls
to
have
a
good
time
in
the
holidays
if
they
only
study
hard
and
behave
themselves
properly
at
well
perhaps
you
are
just
tired
frieda
olive
suggested
and
again
the
youngest
miss
ralston
disagreed
i
am
not
tired
why
should
you
girls
think
there
is
anything
the
matter
with
me
and
she
turned
such
round
innocent
blue
eyes
on
her
audience
that
it
became
silenced
for
five
ten
minutes
afterwards
frieda
continued
to
hold
the
floor
and
then
in
the
midst
of
an
account
of
a
party
given
at
the
johnson
home
she
had
suddenly
stopped
talking
and
thrown
herself
down
on
the
floor
tucking
a
sofa
pillow
under
her
blonde
head
maybe
i
am
tired
on
account
of
the
trip
home
she
confessed
anyhow
i
don
t
want
to
talk
any
more
just
now
i
suppose
olive
you
haven
t
anything
special
to
say
just
having
stayed
here
at
school
with
miss
winthrop
so
jean
you
tell
us
what
you
did
in
new
because
jean
took
up
the
conversational
gauntlet
so
promptly
both
the
older
girls
failed
to
notice
that
before
frieda
had
even
ceased
talking
her
eyes
had
filled
with
tears
the
story
jean
told
of
her
visits
to
gerry
and
margaret
in
new
york
city
was
not
exactly
like
frieda
s
for
though
jean
was
several
years
older
than
her
cousin
in
new
york
school
girls
are
never
allowed
the
same
privileges
that
they
enjoy
in
the
south
but
jean
had
been
to
the
theatre
many
times
and
to
luncheons
and
twice
belknap
had
taken
margaret
and
jean
and
gerry
to
the
opera
in
her
box
yes
cecil
belknap
had
been
very
nice
and
she
had
liked
him
a
little
better
though
she
still
thought
him
horribly
vain
jean
confessed
in
answer
to
a
leading
question
from
frieda
then
she
too
abruptly
concluded
her
story
there
is
just
a
weeny
thing
more
i
have
got
to
tell
everybody
when
the
lights
go
out
she
concluded
but
i
am
not
willing
to
tell
frieda
reached
out
for
comfort
toward
her
box
of
candy
popping
a
large
chocolate
into
her
mouth
now
olive
you
please
tell
us
what
you
did
while
we
went
away
like
selfish
pigs
and
left
you
for
most
two
weeks
you
must
have
had
a
dreadfully
dull
time
frieda
suggested
indulgently
olive
laughed
quietly
well
i
didn
t
have
exactly
a
dull
time
at
least
not
another
chocolate
passed
from
the
box
to
the
youngest
girl
s
lips
oh
i
suppose
you
mean
that
miss
winthrop
was
kind
to
you
and
you
took
long
walks
together
and
things
like
that
i
believe
miss
winthrop
is
really
fond
of
you
olive
even
more
than
she
is
of
jean
and
me
i
wonder
why
at
this
both
the
girls
laughed
oh
i
suppose
it
is
because
she
thinks
olive
the
most
attractive
of
the
three
baby
of
course
you
and
i
are
the
other
two
jean
interrupted
but
i
hope
olive
dear
that
she
was
good
to
and
at
this
simple
remark
of
jean
s
olive
s
face
suddenly
flushed
scarlet
yes
miss
winthrop
has
been
good
to
me
better
than
any
one
else
in
the
world
except
you
ranch
girls
she
replied
struck
by
something
unusual
in
her
friend
s
face
and
expression
jean
s
own
face
suddenly
sobered
what
do
you
mean
how
can
she
have
been
so
unusually
kind
to
you
she
questioned
then
with
a
sudden
flash
of
illumination
olive
ralston
you
have
something
important
on
your
mind
that
you
want
to
tell
us
i
might
have
guessed
that
you
have
been
keeping
it
a
secret
ever
since
we
returned
letting
us
chat
all
this
nonsense
about
our
visits
first
don
t
you
dare
to
tell
us
that
miss
winthrop
wants
to
adopt
you
as
her
daughter
and
that
you
have
consented
or
none
of
us
will
ever
forgive
you
in
this
world
still
olive
hesitated
truly
i
don
t
know
how
to
tell
you
yet
she
murmured
though
i
have
been
planning
a
dozen
different
ways
of
starting
in
the
last
two
that
is
it
then
jean
has
guessed
right
interrupted
frieda
darkly
i
suppose
it
has
happened
just
as
a
punishment
to
us
for
having
left
you
alone
at
primrose
hall
during
the
christmas
holidays
of
course
miss
winthrop
decided
that
we
really
do
not
care
much
for
you
and
for
all
her
coldness
to
the
other
girls
she
needn
t
try
to
deceive
me
she
is
just
crazy
about
you
olive
frieda
now
began
really
to
shed
tears
but
whether
you
like
jean
and
ruth
and
me
or
not
i
never
could
have
believed
that
you
would
be
so
cruel
as
to
turn
your
back
on
poor
jack
when
she
is
too
ill
to
speak
for
herself
she
finished
hush
frieda
olive
returned
sternly
that
is
not
what
i
want
to
tell
you
of
course
miss
winthrop
has
asked
me
to
live
with
her
if
you
should
ever
wish
to
stop
taking
care
of
me
but
i
don
t
want
to
live
with
her
if
you
ranch
girls
want
me
i
was
only
trying
to
what
for
heaven
s
sake
olive
jean
demanded
now
nearly
as
white
and
shaken
as
her
friend
seeing
olive
s
great
difficulty
in
making
her
confession
jean
frieda
olive
began
speaking
quietly
now
and
in
her
accustomed
voice
and
manner
it
is
only
that
since
you
have
been
away
miss
winthrop
has
found
out
for
me
that
i
am
not
an
indian
girl
i
am
not
even
a
western
girl
or
at
least
my
father
was
not
a
westerner
you
remember
the
day
we
went
to
see
the
harmons
at
the
towers
and
old
madame
van
mater
stared
at
me
so
strangely
and
scolded
donald
for
thinking
i
was
like
his
mother
she
did
not
wish
me
to
look
like
harmon
because
harmon
was
my
father
s
first
cousin
oh
olive
what
are
you
talking
about
you
sound
quite
crazy
frieda
interposed
and
then
olive
went
on
even
more
clearly
and
rapidly
telling
the
other
girls
the
history
of
her
father
and
of
herself
as
far
back
as
she
had
learned
it
oh
i
know
you
can
t
believe
what
i
have
told
you
all
at
once
girls
for
it
does
sound
like
a
miracle
or
a
fable
and
we
never
would
have
believed
such
a
story
had
we
read
of
it
in
a
book
but
miss
winthrop
says
that
every
day
in
the
real
world
just
such
wonderful
things
are
happening
as
my
coming
here
to
primrose
hall
in
the
very
neighborhood
where
my
father
used
to
live
and
finding
my
grandmother
alive
in
any
newspaper
you
pick
up
you
can
run
across
just
such
an
odd
as
olive
had
been
allowed
to
talk
on
without
interruption
of
course
she
believed
by
this
time
that
both
jean
and
frieda
understood
the
news
she
had
been
trying
to
make
plain
to
them
frieda
had
risen
to
a
sitting
posture
and
was
staring
at
her
with
frightened
eyes
jean
was
frowning
deeply
you
mean
said
jean
helplessly
you
don
t
mean
said
frieda
at
the
same
moment
and
then
to
relieve
the
tension
of
the
situation
the
three
girls
giggled
hysterically
please
begin
right
at
the
beginning
and
tell
the
whole
story
over
again
olive
and
i
will
try
to
understand
this
time
jean
had
then
commanded
and
patiently
olive
went
through
the
whole
tale
again
therefore
it
was
small
wonder
that
they
forgot
about
the
bedtime
hour
until
a
knock
at
the
door
startled
them
jessica
hunt
was
preceptress
of
their
floor
for
the
evening
and
as
miss
winthrop
had
already
told
her
something
of
olive
s
history
she
readily
allowed
the
ranch
girls
a
half
hour
s
extra
talk
she
could
not
help
their
lights
going
out
at
ten
o
clock
however
but
the
ranch
girls
did
not
really
care
a
candle
under
an
umbrella
makes
an
excellent
light
and
no
one
outside
can
be
any
the
wiser
perhaps
it
was
their
two
weeks
of
separation
perhaps
it
was
olive
s
strange
story
for
rarely
had
the
three
girls
felt
more
devoted
to
one
another
than
they
did
they
were
sitting
with
their
arms
about
one
another
when
olive
jumped
up
please
lend
me
the
candle
a
minute
she
begged
unexpectedly
i
have
been
talking
so
much
about
myself
that
i
forgot
i
had
some
letters
for
you
they
may
be
in
another
moment
coming
back
from
her
desk
she
dropped
several
envelopes
in
jean
s
and
in
frieda
s
hands
i
suppose
if
they
are
christmas
cards
you
can
see
them
by
this
light
she
said
carelessly
but
if
they
are
letters
you
had
best
wait
till
with
a
quick
gesture
frieda
tore
open
one
of
her
envelopes
and
the
paper
enclosed
was
neither
a
card
nor
a
letter
oh
my
goodness
gracious
what
ever
am
i
going
to
do
she
asked
desperately
seeing
three
large
black
figures
staring
at
her
even
in
the
dark
i
have
but
ten
cents
in
all
this
world
and
i
owe
a
bill
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
the
reason
for
the
line
in
frieda
s
brow
was
now
disclosed
instead
of
having
saved
any
of
her
christmas
present
during
her
christmas
visit
she
had
spent
every
cent
of
it
now
without
waiting
for
her
to
find
out
what
she
could
do
to
get
the
money
for
her
dreadful
bill
the
wretched
unkind
shop
people
had
sent
it
her
on
the
very
first
day
of
the
new
year
i
don
t
like
to
borrow
money
of
you
and
olive
jean
when
i
haven
t
paid
back
the
last
frieda
said
after
a
slight
uncomfortable
moment
of
surprise
on
the
part
of
the
other
ranch
girls
but
what
can
i
do
i
suppose
i
have
just
got
to
write
to
ruth
and
jack
asking
them
to
pay
it
for
how
could
you
ever
have
made
such
a
bill
frieda
jean
demanded
looking
over
her
cousin
s
shoulder
in
the
flicker
of
the
candle
light
clothes
the
answer
came
back
in
a
weak
small
voice
unexpectedly
jean
laughed
oh
well
i
need
not
preach
baby
what
i
wanted
to
tell
you
myself
when
the
lights
went
out
is
that
i
became
a
backslider
in
new
york
and
with
ruth
s
consent
told
gerry
and
margaret
that
we
were
not
absolutely
paupers
i
just
had
to
spend
some
of
the
money
i
had
saved
the
things
in
new
york
were
so
fascinating
so
i
haven
t
much
left
to
lend
you
frieda
and
i
am
awfully
sorry
for
ruth
says
the
mine
is
not
yielding
quite
as
much
as
it
formerly
did
and
we
must
all
be
economical
for
such
a
dreadful
lot
of
money
is
needed
right
away
for
jack
i
am
pretty
glad
we
did
not
tell
the
girls
at
primrose
hall
that
we
were
rich
because
it
may
turn
out
that
we
are
not
after
all
gold
mines
are
often
then
i
suppose
i
will
have
to
go
to
prison
for
debt
frieda
murmured
and
both
older
girls
were
heartless
enough
to
laugh
oh
no
it
need
not
go
as
far
as
that
frieda
olive
assured
her
for
i
have
hardly
spent
a
cent
since
coming
to
primrose
hall
so
i
have
nearly
enough
to
help
you
out
so
you
need
not
worry
besides
miss
winthrop
says
that
however
much
i
may
dislike
my
grandmother
and
she
me
i
can
not
refuse
to
allow
her
to
do
for
me
now
that
she
has
discovered
my
whereabouts
for
the
money
that
is
now
hers
should
have
come
to
my
father
even
though
she
did
not
wish
him
to
have
remember
the
fortune
the
old
gypsy
told
you
olive
jean
repeated
just
as
they
were
separating
for
the
night
and
a
fortune
untold
shall
make
for
your
feet
a
rich
pathway
of
i
used
to
think
she
meant
our
chapter
xxii
readjustments
in
the
weeks
that
followed
the
discovery
of
olive
s
connection
with
the
wealthy
old
patroness
of
primrose
hall
a
student
of
psychology
would
have
had
an
interesting
opportunity
in
the
study
of
the
changed
attitude
of
her
schoolmates
toward
her
in
the
first
place
from
being
an
indian
girl
of
uncertain
origin
olive
had
suddenly
become
a
heroine
of
romance
and
also
there
was
the
possibility
that
she
might
in
time
be
an
heiress
should
her
grandmother
change
in
her
feelings
toward
her
and
disinherit
the
harmons
in
any
case
the
law
would
certainly
allow
her
some
portion
of
the
old
estate
so
you
see
that
instead
of
being
looked
down
upon
as
the
most
undesirable
student
at
primrose
hall
the
fourth
ranch
girl
had
suddenly
become
exalted
upon
a
pedestal
and
perhaps
it
is
just
as
deceptive
in
this
world
to
look
up
to
other
people
as
it
is
to
look
down
upon
them
since
a
fair
judgment
can
only
be
attained
by
standing
face
to
face
truly
olive
had
no
more
desire
for
this
second
false
position
than
she
had
for
the
first
but
now
her
shyness
once
regarded
as
ill
breeding
was
called
haughtiness
and
her
classmates
stood
a
little
in
awe
of
her
the
position
was
indeed
a
trying
one
for
everybody
concerned
in
it
for
scarcely
could
the
girls
who
had
been
unkind
to
olive
now
throw
themselves
about
her
neck
begging
her
forgiveness
simply
because
so
unexpected
a
turn
had
come
in
her
fortunes
of
course
some
of
the
unwise
girls
did
do
this
but
not
those
with
better
judgment
and
taste
for
they
understood
that
olive
must
be
approached
more
slowly
and
with
greater
tact
among
this
second
class
of
girls
was
winifred
graham
now
no
one
could
be
more
vexed
than
she
was
with
herself
for
her
persistent
snubbing
of
olive
from
the
first
day
of
her
entrance
into
primrose
hall
not
because
she
liked
olive
any
better
than
she
had
at
first
but
because
winifred
only
cared
for
persons
who
might
be
useful
to
her
and
now
this
ridiculous
olive
with
her
romantic
history
might
be
very
useful
indeed
the
point
at
issue
was
the
bestowal
of
the
shakespeare
prize
of
several
hundred
dollars
given
each
year
by
madame
van
mater
to
the
junior
students
in
jessica
hunt
s
class
mention
has
been
made
before
that
the
three
girls
who
stood
closest
in
line
for
this
prize
were
winifred
olive
and
gerry
now
winifred
supposed
that
olive
would
of
course
withdraw
from
the
contest
since
she
could
hardly
take
a
prize
presented
by
her
own
grandmother
but
what
winifred
feared
was
that
olive
might
throw
the
balance
of
her
influence
in
gerry
s
favor
very
carefully
she
now
undertook
to
show
her
change
of
feeling
toward
the
ranch
girls
without
offending
them
or
making
them
suspicious
by
too
great
haste
a
confidential
talk
with
jessica
hunt
who
had
always
been
their
friend
was
one
of
the
methods
winifred
first
employed
but
there
was
little
assistance
to
be
had
from
jessica
for
in
the
first
place
jessica
declared
immediately
that
olive
was
not
to
give
up
her
effort
to
win
the
shakespeare
prize
jessica
had
talked
the
matter
over
both
with
olive
and
miss
winthrop
and
they
had
decided
in
council
that
olive
need
not
give
up
her
cherished
ambition
on
account
of
her
altered
connection
with
madame
van
mater
the
prize
had
been
freely
offered
without
reservations
to
whatever
girl
in
the
junior
class
should
have
the
best
yearly
record
write
the
best
shakespeare
essay
at
the
close
of
the
school
year
and
give
the
best
recitation
from
any
one
of
the
shakespeare
plays
not
approving
of
olive
s
continuance
in
the
contest
winifred
had
then
freely
expressed
her
opinion
to
jessica
and
afterwards
to
olive
but
though
her
manner
was
now
entirely
friendly
her
protest
had
not
the
least
effect
upon
olive
s
decision
indeed
when
things
had
settled
down
into
routine
again
olive
continued
to
work
harder
than
ever
during
the
following
winter
and
spring
months
of
course
her
position
among
her
classmates
had
altered
somewhat
margaret
and
gerry
were
both
her
friends
as
well
as
a
number
of
other
girls
who
had
never
been
actively
disagreeable
but
with
winifred
olive
could
not
keep
up
more
than
a
faint
pretense
of
friendliness
at
heart
the
two
girls
did
not
like
one
another
and
no
amount
of
veneering
can
ever
cover
a
real
antagonism
of
temperament
they
exchanged
greetings
in
their
class
rooms
and
several
times
winifred
called
on
the
ranch
girls
but
as
her
visits
were
never
returned
she
had
to
try
other
methods
of
softening
the
hostility
her
own
unkindness
had
created
hoping
that
before
the
school
year
was
over
something
would
give
her
a
chance
to
win
their
liking
one
month
after
the
return
of
the
primrose
hall
students
from
their
christmas
holidays
the
theta
sorority
had
solemnly
and
with
distinguished
rites
received
olive
and
jean
into
their
mystic
order
when
finally
the
invitation
so
much
discussed
had
been
extended
to
the
two
ranch
girls
they
had
not
known
what
to
do
in
the
matter
of
course
they
had
not
wished
to
show
continued
ill
feeling
so
with
jessica
s
advice
had
joined
the
society
afterwards
greatly
enjoying
the
pretty
club
house
and
the
frequent
informal
entertainments
which
the
sorority
gave
during
the
rest
of
the
school
year
so
month
after
month
rolled
pleasantly
and
less
eventfully
on
at
primrose
hall
weekly
visits
at
the
command
of
her
grandmother
were
still
made
by
olive
to
the
at
first
miss
winthrop
had
been
in
the
habit
of
accompanying
her
and
later
jean
and
frieda
but
there
were
times
when
pilgrimages
had
to
be
made
alone
why
they
had
to
be
made
at
all
olive
did
not
understand
for
madame
van
mater
still
showed
but
little
liking
for
the
granddaughter
whom
circumstances
and
miss
winthrop
had
surely
thrust
upon
her
if
she
liked
any
one
of
the
three
ranch
girls
it
was
jean
for
as
usual
jean
had
not
really
felt
the
least
fear
of
her
and
when
they
had
made
their
first
call
it
was
with
difficulty
that
she
refrained
from
giving
her
hostess
a
piece
of
her
mind
in
regard
to
her
treatment
of
olive
perhaps
madame
van
mater
s
age
prevented
her
from
receiving
the
scolding
and
perhaps
her
manner
for
instead
jean
told
her
the
story
of
the
ranch
girls
discovery
of
olive
and
of
how
much
she
had
previously
suffered
and
perhaps
this
story
worked
as
well
as
the
scolding
since
the
old
mistress
of
the
towers
abruptly
invited
jean
to
tell
her
nothing
more
of
this
woman
laska
but
of
their
life
at
the
rainbow
ranch
although
all
three
girls
could
be
eloquent
on
the
subject
of
the
ranch
jean
was
allowed
the
floor
and
three
times
in
the
course
of
the
conversation
madame
van
mater
actually
had
laughed
aloud
a
proceeding
most
unusual
with
her
perhaps
after
all
in
spite
of
her
hardness
and
pride
the
old
woman
had
not
been
altogether
happy
over
her
treatment
of
her
son
s
child
even
though
she
believed
that
her
son
had
forfeited
her
love
and
consideration
by
his
own
actions
but
whatever
her
reasons
thus
far
kept
to
herself
olive
was
forced
to
continue
the
weekly
calls
one
afternoon
in
april
when
miss
winthrop
was
busy
with
school
matters
and
jean
and
frieda
were
engaged
in
a
game
of
basketball
olive
found
herself
compelled
to
go
alone
to
see
her
grandmother
and
she
was
particularly
vexed
over
this
special
visit
as
she
had
wished
to
join
the
other
girls
in
their
game
always
until
this
afternoon
olive
had
been
received
by
madame
van
mater
with
entire
formality
in
the
old
drawing
room
where
they
had
had
their
two
memorable
meetings
but
she
found
the
drawing
room
empty
and
while
she
waited
a
maid
came
to
say
that
she
was
kindly
to
walk
upstairs
anything
was
better
than
the
stiffness
and
coldness
of
the
old
drawing
room
because
the
spring
day
was
cool
olive
on
going
upstairs
found
her
grandmother
before
an
open
fire
wrapped
about
with
silk
shawls
and
comforts
her
hair
was
of
course
piled
as
high
as
usual
and
her
costume
as
handsome
but
it
was
plain
to
see
that
she
was
not
so
well
kindly
don
t
come
near
me
as
i
am
suffering
from
a
severe
cold
she
announced
as
olive
approached
to
shake
hands
with
her
never
having
at
any
time
offered
her
any
more
intimate
greeting
olive
sat
down
trying
to
look
properly
interested
but
really
feeling
bored
and
uncomfortable
at
the
thought
of
the
next
half
hour
these
visits
and
the
fact
that
jack
ralston
was
still
a
prisoner
in
new
york
were
the
only
worries
she
now
seemed
to
have
at
primrose
hall
i
am
sorry
you
are
ill
she
began
politely
only
to
have
her
remark
waved
aside
i
am
not
ill
madame
van
mater
returned
only
not
well
but
if
i
were
there
are
other
more
important
matters
than
my
health
which
i
wish
to
discuss
with
you
this
afternoon
therefore
am
i
very
glad
to
see
you
there
was
no
answer
to
be
made
to
this
statement
olive
had
never
attempted
to
be
hypocritical
with
her
grandmother
by
pretending
to
feel
any
affection
for
her
she
now
simply
sat
perfectly
still
and
respectful
waiting
to
hear
what
was
to
be
said
next
but
rarely
had
she
looked
more
attractive
than
on
this
afternoon
in
the
first
place
her
walk
had
given
her
a
bright
color
and
she
was
wearing
a
particularly
becoming
frock
miss
winthrop
had
insisted
that
olive
always
dress
with
great
care
on
these
visits
to
her
grandmother
so
this
special
frock
which
ruth
lately
had
sent
from
new
york
was
now
worn
for
the
first
time
it
was
of
some
soft
material
of
silk
and
wool
made
with
a
short
waist
and
softly
clinging
skirt
of
a
bright
golden
brown
with
a
girdle
of
brown
velvet
olive
was
very
slender
always
and
of
only
medium
height
but
her
dark
coloring
was
rich
and
unusual
and
now
her
expression
was
gayer
and
in
some
unconscious
way
she
seemed
more
confident
and
less
timid
in
her
manner
than
formerly
for
several
moments
after
her
first
long
speech
madame
van
mater
continued
to
study
the
appearance
of
the
young
girl
sitting
opposite
her
and
then
without
the
least
warning
of
her
intention
said
abruptly
olive
i
suppose
you
have
not
understood
why
i
have
insisted
on
your
coming
to
see
me
so
regularly
and
constantly
since
my
discovery
of
your
connection
with
me
you
may
of
course
have
guessed
but
if
you
have
not
i
am
prepared
to
tell
you
this
afternoon
i
have
been
studying
you
and
i
am
now
willing
to
say
that
i
have
in
the
past
done
you
a
great
injustice
however
much
my
son
disappointed
me
by
his
choice
of
an
occupation
and
by
his
marriage
to
your
mother
instead
of
katherine
winthrop
i
had
no
real
right
to
cast
off
from
me
all
responsibility
in
regard
to
his
child
you
are
not
altogether
what
i
would
have
you
to
be
you
have
less
social
ease
of
manner
and
less
conversational
ability
than
i
desire
in
my
granddaughter
but
i
am
prepared
to
overlook
these
faults
in
you
now
olive
or
at
least
to
give
you
time
to
conquer
them
what
i
am
coming
to
is
this
i
have
recently
decided
to
make
reparation
to
you
by
having
you
come
here
to
live
with
me
when
your
year
at
primrose
hall
is
passed
and
if
i
find
you
as
refined
and
as
capable
of
being
managed
as
i
now
suppose
you
to
be
i
am
prepared
to
change
my
will
making
you
heir
to
the
greater
part
of
my
estate
and
giving
my
and
nephew
donald
and
elizabeth
harmon
only
the
portion
formerly
intended
for
you
you
need
not
thank
me
i
am
doing
this
simply
because
i
wish
to
do
it
and
also
because
it
will
please
katherine
winthrop
who
is
one
of
the
few
persons
for
whom
i
have
always
olive
smiled
although
the
smile
did
not
really
cross
her
lips
but
seemed
somehow
to
drift
across
her
entire
face
i
had
no
intention
of
thanking
you
grandmother
she
returned
quietly
only
of
refusing
your
offer
it
may
be
very
kind
of
you
to
desire
me
to
live
with
you
but
i
thought
you
understood
that
nothing
and
no
one
in
the
world
could
ever
persuade
me
to
stop
living
with
the
ranch
girls
so
long
as
they
wish
me
to
be
with
them
and
even
after
we
are
grown
up
and
they
marry
or
anything
else
happens
why
even
then
i
have
plans
of
my
ranch
girls
fiddlesticks
exclaimed
madame
van
mater
far
more
inelegantly
than
one
would
have
thought
possible
to
her
of
course
i
wish
to
say
nothing
against
these
friends
of
yours
under
the
circumstances
i
am
even
prepared
to
be
grateful
to
them
for
their
kindness
to
you
but
surely
you
can
not
expect
to
live
forever
on
their
bounty
and
what
can
they
offer
you
in
the
way
of
social
opportunity
i
believe
they
have
no
parents
to
introduce
them
into
society
only
this
chaperon
named
ruth
drew
and
some
man
or
other
who
manages
their
olive
flushed
and
then
smiled
i
don
t
believe
i
am
very
anxious
or
very
well
fitted
for
social
opportunity
she
answered
but
i
don
t
think
you
need
worry
about
the
ranch
girls
for
when
the
time
comes
for
them
to
take
any
part
in
society
i
am
sure
they
will
find
opportunities
enough
i
wrote
jack
only
a
few
weeks
ago
ten
days
after
her
operation
was
over
that
as
soon
as
she
was
well
enough
and
whenever
she
wanted
me
to
i
would
go
back
with
her
to
the
ranch
or
we
would
travel
or
do
whatever
was
best
for
her
of
course
we
don
t
any
of
us
know
yet
whether
jack
s
operation
was
successful
but
jean
and
frieda
and
i
have
positively
made
up
our
minds
that
nothing
will
induce
us
to
be
separated
from
her
after
this
you
are
talking
school
girl
nonsense
madame
van
mater
returned
coldly
but
naturally
i
do
not
care
to
argue
this
question
with
you
i
shall
have
katherine
winthrop
put
the
matter
before
you
but
you
can
rest
assured
olive
of
these
two
things
in
the
first
place
that
if
at
any
time
you
displease
me
i
can
leave
my
money
to
any
one
whom
i
may
select
as
my
husband
s
will
gave
his
estate
entirely
into
my
hands
and
in
the
second
place
that
if
i
desire
to
control
your
actions
you
are
not
yet
of
age
and
i
and
not
the
ranch
girls
am
your
natural
very
few
times
in
her
life
had
olive
ever
known
what
it
was
to
be
violently
angry
and
yet
no
matter
how
gentle
one
s
nature
anger
must
get
the
best
of
all
of
us
now
and
then
quickly
the
girl
now
got
up
from
her
chair
and
crossing
the
room
faced
madame
van
mater
with
an
expression
as
determined
as
her
own
please
understand
that
i
do
not
want
to
defraud
either
donald
or
elizabeth
harmon
of
the
money
you
have
always
promised
them
they
have
been
very
kind
since
the
discovery
of
my
connection
with
them
and
of
course
you
must
be
more
fond
of
them
than
you
can
ever
be
of
me
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
though
i
don
t
want
to
be
rude
or
unfair
i
do
not
like
you
grandmother
nor
do
i
feel
that
i
can
ever
forgive
the
years
of
your
neglect
of
me
do
you
think
it
is
quite
fair
for
you
now
to
speak
of
being
my
natural
guardian
when
for
so
many
years
you
desired
nothing
so
much
as
that
my
name
should
never
be
mentioned
to
you
please
don
t
let
us
talk
of
this
ever
ever
any
more
but
understand
that
i
shall
never
leave
the
ranch
plainly
madame
van
mater
was
amazed
at
olive
s
unexpected
anger
for
until
this
moment
her
granddaughter
had
always
seemed
to
her
rather
too
gentle
and
shy
now
the
old
woman
simply
shrugged
her
shoulders
indifferently
you
may
go
she
replied
but
of
course
olive
i
shall
decide
later
what
course
in
regard
to
you
i
shall
consider
it
advisable
to
so
with
scarlet
cheeks
and
feeling
more
obstinate
than
ever
before
in
her
life
olive
finding
herself
dismissed
rushed
for
consolation
to
primrose
hall
chapter
xxiii
may
time
is
gay
time
may
had
arrived
and
with
it
the
first
warm
spring
weather
along
the
hudson
river
valley
now
the
river
was
often
crowded
with
sail
boats
dipping
their
white
and
gray
canvases
toward
the
sky
and
toward
the
water
like
the
wings
of
a
seagull
motor
boats
chugged
along
making
more
noise
than
automobiles
while
the
steam
yachts
ever
the
aristocrats
among
all
water
craft
sailing
into
their
own
harbors
up
and
down
the
hudson
shores
ever
and
anon
put
forth
again
as
though
intending
to
leave
home
behind
for
adventures
on
the
open
sea
all
the
hills
beyond
and
near
by
the
neighborhood
of
sleepy
hollow
were
like
mammoth
bouquets
with
their
fragrance
and
beauty
upturned
to
the
sun
while
within
the
meadows
and
fields
and
gardens
were
a
greater
variety
of
than
can
be
found
in
many
other
places
in
this
land
now
at
last
the
ranch
girls
understood
why
miss
katherine
winthrop
s
old
home
had
been
called
primrose
hall
long
before
ever
the
school
was
thought
of
for
wild
primroses
blossomed
everywhere
although
the
season
was
late
until
the
garden
about
the
old
place
looked
like
the
famous
field
of
the
cloth
of
as
much
as
possible
on
these
bright
may
days
the
students
at
primrose
hall
lived
out
of
doors
but
with
the
school
year
drawing
to
a
close
it
was
not
always
easy
to
desert
lessons
and
the
thought
of
approaching
examinations
one
afternoon
jean
and
frieda
had
arranged
themselves
in
a
corner
of
one
of
the
big
verandas
with
a
table
between
them
and
a
screen
carefully
set
up
to
protect
them
from
interruption
the
girls
were
not
talking
indeed
an
utter
silence
had
reigned
between
them
for
the
last
ten
minutes
broken
only
by
the
squeak
of
frieda
s
pen
writing
its
last
essay
for
the
present
term
and
by
an
occasional
sigh
from
jean
from
the
depth
of
an
oration
by
cicero
stealing
along
outside
the
defensive
wall
of
this
screen
a
short
time
later
mysterious
footsteps
might
be
heard
not
of
one
pair
of
feet
but
of
several
and
yet
not
a
single
head
appeared
above
it
frowning
jean
listened
and
then
went
on
with
her
work
determined
not
to
be
lured
from
the
strict
path
of
duty
whatever
geese
are
outside
the
screen
she
thought
to
herself
seeing
our
sign
on
it
positively
no
admittance
studying
will
go
away
and
leave
us
in
but
when
a
screen
falls
to
the
floor
with
a
bang
only
a
few
inches
from
where
one
is
seated
certainly
no
degree
of
devotion
to
the
study
of
literature
and
the
classics
will
prevent
one
from
jumping
up
with
a
scream
and
this
jean
and
frieda
did
at
the
same
instant
and
behold
there
with
only
the
prostrate
screen
dividing
them
were
gerry
and
margaret
lucy
and
mollie
johnson
besides
several
other
members
of
their
junior
class
the
city
has
fallen
and
the
prisoners
are
ours
gerry
announced
pointing
a
pen
at
jean
s
heart
as
an
improvised
dagger
jean
tried
not
to
look
cross
look
here
girls
what
do
you
want
with
us
she
demanded
you
know
it
isn
t
fair
to
come
interrupting
a
fellow
at
his
labors
and
miss
oh
miss
winthrop
old
thing
gerry
answered
saucily
do
you
suppose
that
when
school
is
nearly
over
that
we
care
half
so
much
for
the
views
and
wishes
of
our
lady
principal
as
we
do
earlier
in
the
year
when
we
might
have
to
live
on
under
the
shadow
of
her
displeasure
however
on
this
one
occasion
the
fear
of
that
august
personage
need
not
darken
our
young
lives
since
she
has
given
her
consent
to
what
i
am
now
about
to
propose
oh
well
since
it
is
margaret
s
party
i
suppose
i
had
best
let
her
extend
the
actual
invitation
while
i
beg
you
to
accept
it
jean
put
up
two
protesting
hands
but
frieda
showed
no
such
moral
hesitancy
please
don
t
ask
frieda
and
me
to
do
anything
agreeable
this
afternoon
jean
pleaded
for
we
simply
can
t
accept
any
invitation
and
yet
if
you
ask
us
we
margaret
belknap
laughed
of
course
you
will
when
you
hear
what
it
is
you
must
get
your
coats
and
hats
at
once
and
come
and
drive
with
us
for
a
mile
or
so
to
the
nearest
landing
pier
and
there
father
and
cecil
will
be
waiting
for
us
in
our
yacht
to
take
us
for
a
oh
my
goodness
gracious
me
exclaimed
frieda
ecstatically
gathering
her
school
paraphernalia
into
her
arms
and
to
think
that
i
have
never
been
on
a
yacht
or
even
a
sailboat
in
my
whole
life
apparently
there
was
to
be
no
further
question
of
their
studies
this
afternoon
for
jean
and
frieda
now
fairly
leaped
over
the
overturned
screen
in
their
efforts
to
get
up
to
their
room
for
hats
and
coats
without
delay
however
but
two
minutes
had
passed
a
not
sufficient
time
for
jean
to
have
made
preparations
for
the
trip
when
she
was
seen
slowly
returning
toward
her
group
of
friends
margaret
gerry
she
begged
if
the
other
girls
will
please
excuse
us
i
want
to
speak
to
you
privately
for
half
a
jean
s
face
was
flushed
and
her
manner
embarrassed
please
don
t
think
i
am
ungrateful
for
your
invitation
margaret
she
said
softly
but
really
i
don
t
believe
i
had
better
go
with
you
this
afternoon
after
all
frieda
says
she
go
and
unconsciously
the
speaker
put
an
added
emphasis
on
the
verb
will
margaret
hurt
at
her
friend
s
attitude
did
not
answer
at
once
particularly
as
gerry
hardly
gave
her
the
opportunity
will
you
kindly
tell
us
jean
bruce
what
has
happened
to
make
you
change
your
mind
in
the
distance
between
the
veranda
and
your
bedroom
door
she
inquired
you
need
not
tell
me
that
you
won
t
go
for
a
sail
on
the
hudson
for
the
first
time
in
your
life
because
you
love
your
cicero
jean
shook
her
head
smiling
in
spite
of
herself
well
not
oh
margaret
for
heaven
s
sake
explain
to
jean
that
we
have
asked
olive
too
but
that
olive
says
she
positively
can
t
join
us
of
course
she
is
working
on
that
plagued
old
shakespeare
essay
of
hers
and
to
think
that
once
i
believed
i
had
a
chance
at
that
shakespeare
at
gerry
s
first
words
jean
s
face
had
magically
cleared
oh
if
margaret
wants
olive
too
i
will
make
her
come
along
with
us
she
shall
not
be
such
a
grind
she
protested
but
before
she
could
vanish
for
the
second
time
margaret
and
gerry
both
clutched
at
her
skirts
don
t
urge
olive
to
come
with
us
for
you
see
we
don
t
really
want
her
and
only
asked
her
because
we
knew
she
couldn
t
margaret
explained
hastily
and
then
seeing
jean
s
face
crimson
with
anger
and
resentment
she
gave
her
an
affectionate
shake
oh
for
heaven
s
sake
child
when
will
you
ranch
girls
get
over
being
so
touchy
about
one
another
you
know
that
now
we
know
olive
better
we
like
her
as
much
as
any
girl
in
our
class
to
tell
you
the
truth
it
is
just
because
we
are
trying
to
fix
up
some
plan
to
show
olive
how
we
feel
toward
her
that
we
did
not
want
her
to
come
along
with
us
now
it
seemed
to
us
this
would
be
our
best
chance
to
let
you
know
our
idea
and
to
see
what
you
think
about
it
i
suppose
i
might
have
told
you
this
at
first
margaret
ended
only
i
am
not
a
tactful
person
and
perhaps
put
things
pretty
you
certainly
did
jean
laughed
but
now
i
will
hurry
and
get
my
belongings
as
i
am
perfectly
dying
to
hear
what
you
have
in
an
hour
later
eight
members
of
the
junior
class
frieda
and
mollie
and
miss
rebecca
sterne
having
arrived
at
a
private
landing
pier
not
far
from
their
school
were
assisted
aboard
the
steam
yacht
marathon
by
cecil
belknap
and
his
father
during
the
first
half
of
the
sail
there
was
little
real
conversation
among
the
girls
only
ohs
and
ahs
of
delight
at
the
beauty
of
the
river
scenery
and
the
wonders
of
the
yacht
but
by
and
by
on
their
return
journey
when
margaret
and
her
guests
were
seated
around
the
salon
dining
table
drinking
afternoon
tea
gerry
who
never
could
bear
putting
off
things
turned
to
her
hostess
look
here
margaret
she
said
in
tones
loud
enough
for
the
entire
company
to
overhear
if
your
father
and
brother
will
pardon
us
i
vote
that
we
plunge
right
into
the
subject
we
have
come
together
to
discuss
this
afternoon
i
suppose
your
father
and
cecil
must
both
have
heard
something
of
olive
s
story
by
margaret
nodded
jean
was
not
so
sure
that
she
cared
to
have
olive
s
difficulties
at
school
discussed
before
cecil
belknap
whom
she
did
not
yet
thoroughly
like
but
as
margaret
s
guest
she
did
not
like
to
protest
gerry
then
leaned
across
the
table
toward
the
ranch
girls
with
her
teaspoon
poised
in
the
air
look
here
jean
frieda
everybody
it
is
just
like
this
you
know
that
when
the
three
ranch
girls
came
to
primrose
hall
most
of
us
liked
two
of
the
three
girls
right
from
the
first
after
a
few
of
their
western
peculiarities
had
rubbed
up
against
our
eastern
ones
but
with
the
third
girl
with
it
was
different
in
the
first
place
olive
was
shy
and
did
not
look
exactly
like
the
rest
of
us
she
is
much
prettier
than
i
am
for
example
in
the
second
place
the
story
was
circulated
about
among
the
girls
that
olive
was
part
indian
the
daughter
of
a
dreadfully
ignorant
indian
woman
from
whom
she
had
run
away
and
that
now
she
was
trying
to
pretend
that
she
was
no
relation
to
her
own
mother
of
course
had
any
one
of
us
ever
looked
at
olive
very
hard
we
must
have
known
that
this
story
was
an
untruth
or
else
only
a
half
truth
which
is
the
worst
kind
of
a
lie
but
we
were
too
prejudiced
and
olive
too
shy
to
stand
up
for
herself
what
is
the
use
of
my
going
into
this
horrid
part
of
my
story
when
i
want
to
come
to
the
fairy
tale
at
the
end
after
a
while
some
of
us
girls
did
begin
to
see
a
little
further
than
the
end
of
our
noses
and
to
suspect
that
a
girl
as
clever
as
olive
in
her
studies
as
lovely
in
disposition
and
as
refined
and
gentle
in
her
manner
could
hardly
be
what
we
had
believed
her
simply
couldn
t
and
now
i
want
to
say
just
one
thing
in
excuse
for
myself
i
did
know
that
olive
was
a
lady
and
more
than
a
lady
a
trump
before
i
learned
that
she
was
not
an
indian
girl
but
a
heroine
and
here
gerry
paused
an
instant
to
sigh
and
to
get
her
breath
in
order
to
continue
to
express
her
romantic
delight
in
the
change
of
the
stranger
girl
s
fortune
hurriedly
however
margaret
belknap
now
seized
this
moment
s
respite
i
knew
that
olive
was
charming
too
she
interposed
and
i
did
try
to
be
nicer
to
her
before
i
went
away
for
the
christmas
holidays
intending
on
my
return
to
ask
her
to
overlook
the
past
and
be
friends
i
suppose
there
were
other
girls
in
our
class
who
felt
the
same
way
and
had
this
same
intention
as
margaret
paused
four
or
five
other
voices
answered
there
certainly
were
before
she
went
on
yes
i
know
but
after
we
got
back
from
our
holidays
it
was
then
too
late
to
make
olive
believe
in
our
good
intentions
because
in
that
short
time
things
had
so
changed
for
her
that
she
had
become
more
interesting
than
any
of
the
rest
of
us
you
can
see
jean
and
frieda
just
what
we
have
been
up
against
the
margaret
was
not
conscious
of
using
slang
at
this
moment
and
only
her
brother
smiled
at
her
if
our
junior
class
had
then
rushed
up
at
once
to
olive
and
apologized
to
her
after
we
had
learned
of
what
had
befallen
her
why
we
did
not
believe
that
she
would
care
very
much
for
such
a
belated
repentance
so
for
months
now
we
have
been
trying
to
think
of
some
pretty
and
tactful
way
to
show
our
real
feeling
toward
her
and
now
we
hope
we
have
at
last
hit
upon
the
right
do
let
me
tell
the
rest
margaret
you
have
talked
such
a
long
time
and
though
a
laugh
went
all
around
the
table
at
her
expense
gerry
again
burst
forth
everybody
here
knows
that
we
are
to
have
our
school
finals
now
in
a
short
time
and
see
the
seniors
graduate
and
the
juniors
who
are
trying
for
the
shakespeare
prize
give
their
recitations
before
the
committee
specially
chosen
to
pass
on
them
then
of
course
we
have
luncheon
and
afterwards
a
dance
on
the
lawn
with
all
our
guests
at
the
commencement
present
but
there
is
one
thing
that
perhaps
you
two
ranch
girls
don
t
know
and
that
is
that
we
always
choose
one
of
the
primrose
hall
girls
as
our
queen
for
commencement
day
of
course
she
must
be
selected
from
among
the
entire
school
not
from
any
one
class
but
margaret
and
some
of
the
other
juniors
and
i
have
been
talking
things
over
with
the
seniors
and
they
say
it
is
our
turn
to
have
the
queen
and
that
they
are
willing
know
what
we
want
to
do
don
t
you
jean
and
frieda
jean
bowed
her
head
showing
that
she
understood
but
frieda
still
appeared
mystified
i
think
it
would
be
a
beautiful
thing
for
you
girls
to
do
if
you
really
wish
to
do
it
jean
answered
a
bit
huskily
although
she
was
trying
not
to
show
any
special
emotion
before
cecil
belknap
who
had
been
watching
her
pretty
closely
all
afternoon
through
his
same
hateful
pair
of
eyeglasses
beautiful
to
do
what
frieda
now
demanded
turning
first
toward
mollie
and
then
toward
lucy
johnson
for
the
explanation
of
this
everlasting
preamble
of
gerry
s
and
margaret
s
why
choose
olive
for
our
school
queen
for
commencement
day
gerry
returned
and
as
our
finals
take
place
in
may
i
suppose
you
can
call
her
queen
of
the
may
if
you
like
for
you
see
she
does
preside
over
our
dances
all
afternoon
leads
any
special
ones
and
we
pay
her
whatever
homage
we
can
now
please
don
t
you
cecil
or
any
other
human
being
at
this
table
start
reciting
you
must
wake
and
call
me
early
call
me
early
mother
dear
she
concluded
for
if
it
were
not
for
that
tiresome
weepy
poem
i
should
think
the
choosing
of
a
may
queen
one
of
the
prettiest
customs
in
the
world
but
i
can
assure
you
that
at
least
eleven
out
of
every
twelve
persons
who
come
to
our
commencement
feel
called
upon
to
spout
that
poem
i
suppose
because
it
is
so
ridiculously
easy
to
as
soon
as
the
speaker
finished
margaret
jumped
up
from
the
table
her
guests
immediately
following
suit
then
it
is
all
settled
she
exclaimed
happily
lifting
high
her
pretty
teacup
so
let
us
drink
to
olive
as
our
next
queen
and
to
the
other
ranch
i
suppose
you
mean
jack
too
even
if
you
don
t
know
her
frieda
suggested
loyally
before
joining
in
the
toast
and
gerry
s
hearty
of
course
ended
the
pretty
scene
for
now
the
entire
party
of
girls
deserting
the
salon
made
their
way
again
out
on
to
the
deck
of
the
yacht
of
the
group
jean
was
the
last
to
leave
followed
by
cecil
belknap
oh
i
say
miss
bruce
will
you
go
a
bit
slow
he
asked
my
sister
tells
me
that
she
has
asked
you
to
pay
us
a
visit
at
our
cottage
on
the
massachusetts
coast
this
summer
and
i
hope
you
are
going
to
be
jolly
enough
to
come
for
i
should
enjoy
it
most
you
wouldn
t
really
not
a
visit
from
a
western
ranch
girl
jean
s
eyes
danced
but
it
is
very
kind
of
you
to
say
so
she
ended
prettily
extending
her
hand
to
the
young
man
cecil
was
looking
out
the
open
door
to
where
the
lights
were
now
twinkling
forth
one
by
one
along
the
side
of
the
jersey
shore
no
it
is
not
what
i
would
call
good
of
me
he
replied
quietly
i
thought
i
told
you
at
our
house
at
christmas
that
i
liked
you
and
that
if
there
wasn
t
any
fellow
out
west
i
would
like
to
see
more
of
you
anyhow
do
say
you
will
make
us
the
visit
with
a
new
dignity
that
a
year
of
primrose
hall
had
helped
develop
in
her
jean
now
shook
her
head
no
she
replied
quietly
i
have
already
explained
to
margaret
that
i
shan
t
be
able
to
come
to
her
this
summer
you
see
my
cousin
jack
ralston
whether
she
is
better
or
not
is
to
leave
the
hospital
in
new
york
early
in
june
and
then
we
expect
to
go
back
to
the
rainbow
ranch
for
the
summer
time
after
that
we
may
go
who
knows
where
the
young
people
went
out
on
deck
together
as
the
yacht
was
now
running
in
toward
shore
and
beyond
the
landing
pier
in
the
soft
spring
dusk
the
travelers
could
see
the
old
school
carryall
and
in
another
carriage
olive
and
miss
winthrop
waiting
to
drive
the
party
back
to
primrose
hall
but
before
anybody
was
allowed
to
leave
the
yacht
gerry
had
solemnly
whispered
to
each
one
of
them
remember
please
olive
is
not
to
hear
a
single
solitary
word
about
our
plan
it
is
to
be
a
secret
up
to
the
very
last
chapter
xxiv
shakespeare
s
heroines
i
declare
i
never
saw
such
a
spectacle
as
i
am
in
my
life
gerry
ferrows
protested
turning
half
way
around
to
get
a
back
view
of
herself
in
her
bedroom
mirror
you
look
perfectly
lovely
winifred
and
i
would
not
be
a
bit
surprised
if
you
get
the
shakespeare
prize
after
all
even
though
olive
has
the
best
class
record
for
the
year
and
i
the
highest
mark
for
my
essay
we
are
so
close
together
in
this
contest
that
the
least
thing
may
change
the
balance
it
is
my
private
opinion
that
whoever
gives
the
best
shakespeare
recitation
will
receive
the
and
gerry
sighed
and
then
laughed
as
she
stooped
to
adjust
her
doublet
and
hose
dear
me
winifred
why
couldn
t
i
have
been
born
a
stately
blonde
beauty
like
you
so
that
i
might
have
appeared
as
lovely
ophelia
instead
of
having
to
represent
rosalind
on
account
of
my
short
hair
winifred
also
laughed
just
the
least
bit
complacently
happening
at
that
moment
to
catch
sight
of
her
own
fair
reflection
she
was
dressed
in
a
long
clinging
robe
of
some
soft
white
material
and
her
pale
blonde
hair
bound
with
a
fillet
of
silver
hung
loose
about
her
neck
in
her
hand
she
held
a
sheet
of
paper
with
her
speech
written
upon
it
which
she
glanced
at
a
little
nervously
every
now
and
then
oh
what
a
noble
mind
is
here
o
erthrown
the
courtier
s
soldier
s
scholar
s
eye
tongue
sword
the
expectancy
and
rose
of
the
fair
dear
me
gerry
don
t
talk
of
my
winning
the
prize
by
my
recitation
winifred
groaned
i
have
the
most
dreadful
case
of
stage
fright
already
and
to
think
that
i
have
to
make
the
first
speech
she
glanced
up
at
the
clock
on
their
mantel
it
is
only
a
half
hour
now
before
we
must
go
downstairs
and
i
believe
that
there
have
never
been
so
many
guests
at
one
of
our
commencements
before
i
suppose
it
is
because
the
day
is
so
beautiful
that
we
can
have
our
whole
entertainment
outdoors
i
wish
we
had
a
front
window
for
i
am
sure
i
have
heard
at
least
a
hundred
automobiles
drive
up
to
the
house
if
we
go
to
the
ranch
girls
room
we
can
see
out
into
the
yard
and
i
can
have
a
look
at
olive
i
am
simply
dying
to
find
out
what
she
looks
like
gerry
shook
her
head
positively
jean
says
that
no
one
is
to
come
near
olive
she
even
means
to
go
downstairs
with
her
herself
and
to
slip
around
to
the
entrance
to
the
stage
in
the
pavilion
so
that
no
one
shall
dare
speak
to
her
so
i
suppose
if
the
truth
be
known
winifred
olive
is
just
about
as
badly
scared
as
you
are
and
a
good
deal
more
so
considering
how
dreadfully
shy
she
is
but
don
t
fear
that
she
will
not
look
pretty
i
heard
jessica
hunt
say
the
other
night
that
she
never
saw
any
one
so
exquisite
in
her
life
as
olive
in
her
shakespeare
costume
and
i
feel
rather
proud
because
olive
chose
perdita
in
the
winter
s
tale
for
her
character
because
i
asked
her
to
she
had
once
made
me
think
of
a
description
of
winifred
flushed
angrily
and
then
began
walking
up
and
down
the
room
see
here
gerry
ferrows
i
do
think
it
is
just
too
hateful
for
you
to
have
kept
on
encouraging
olive
to
try
for
this
prize
it
will
look
awfully
queer
to
people
if
she
accepts
a
prize
from
her
own
grandmother
anyhow
and
i
do
need
it
most
in
her
nervousness
and
temper
winifred
was
almost
in
tears
though
not
for
worlds
would
she
consciously
have
marred
her
lovely
appearance
a
low
whistle
came
from
between
gerry
s
red
lips
please
don
t
leave
me
out
of
the
race
altogether
sweet
winifred
she
begged
i
may
not
have
so
great
beauty
as
you
and
olive
to
commend
me
but
remember
from
the
east
to
western
ind
no
jewel
is
like
rosalind
her
worth
being
mounted
on
the
wind
through
all
the
world
bears
then
gerry
marching
over
with
an
exaggerated
swashbuckling
stride
toward
winifred
smote
her
on
the
shoulder
with
more
friendliness
than
she
had
shown
her
in
many
weeks
come
winifred
what
is
the
use
of
our
worrying
now
i
believe
i
need
this
prize
money
quite
as
much
as
you
do
since
my
father
has
just
made
some
unfortunate
investments
and
may
not
be
able
to
let
me
come
back
to
old
primrose
hall
to
graduate
next
year
and
of
course
we
know
this
prize
would
mean
our
tuition
but
we
must
take
what
comes
with
a
good
grace
for
you
and
olive
and
i
have
an
equally
fair
chance
with
our
speeches
so
if
olive
wins
we
ought
not
to
fuss
for
i
can
perfectly
well
understand
how
she
wants
the
glory
of
winning
and
not
the
prize
itself
she
told
me
that
she
had
been
working
for
this
prize
ever
since
she
first
came
to
primrose
hall
in
order
to
show
her
beloved
jack
ralston
how
much
she
had
appreciated
the
opportunities
she
had
given
in
reply
winifred
merely
shrugged
her
shoulders
scornfully
but
at
the
same
instant
a
bell
sounding
out
on
the
lawn
and
a
great
clapping
of
hands
she
again
fell
to
studying
the
paper
in
her
hand
good
gracious
there
is
someone
s
speech
just
ending
she
exclaimed
so
our
turns
will
come
and
gerry
even
though
she
was
sure
of
being
letter
perfect
in
rosalind
s
saucy
reply
to
orlando
no
no
orlando
men
are
april
when
they
woo
december
when
they
wed
opened
her
as
you
like
it
and
began
once
more
to
read
over
her
part
so
five
ten
fifteen
minutes
went
by
and
then
jessica
hunt
s
voice
was
heard
outside
in
the
hall
where
are
my
shakespeare
heroines
she
demanded
gerry
winifred
please
put
your
long
coats
around
you
and
come
on
downstairs
now
the
coast
is
clear
and
it
is
almost
time
for
your
speeches
i
will
tell
winifred
had
indeed
been
right
no
commencement
day
at
primrose
hall
had
ever
been
so
beautiful
as
this
one
and
never
before
had
one
called
forth
so
many
guests
built
as
like
as
possible
to
an
old
greek
outdoor
theatre
a
stage
had
been
erected
at
the
edge
of
a
grove
of
trees
not
many
yards
from
the
great
house
and
a
kind
of
covered
arbor
temporarily
arranged
so
that
the
girls
who
took
part
in
the
commencement
exercises
might
pass
from
the
house
to
the
stage
without
being
seen
by
the
audience
the
stage
had
no
curtain
and
only
the
sky
for
a
canopy
a
rarely
blue
sky
with
the
white
clouds
that
melt
before
the
deeper
warmth
of
june
on
either
side
were
piled
great
branches
of
trees
freshly
brought
in
from
the
woods
delicately
green
with
the
early
leaves
of
spring
and
the
floor
of
the
stage
was
strewn
with
buttercups
violets
and
daisies
in
the
yard
facing
the
pretty
impromptu
theatre
the
audience
was
seated
perhaps
two
hundred
persons
so
that
any
girl
making
her
first
public
appearance
before
it
might
reasonably
be
frightened
perhaps
it
was
the
beauty
of
the
day
perhaps
the
novelty
of
miss
winthrop
s
stage
arrangements
for
surely
no
audience
had
ever
appeared
more
enthusiastic
than
hers
and
as
each
girl
had
stepped
forth
on
the
stage
apparently
entering
from
the
heart
of
a
woods
on
to
a
carpet
of
flowers
the
applause
and
interest
had
increased
the
shakespeare
heroines
were
to
be
the
closing
feature
of
the
programme
therefore
in
the
front
row
facing
the
stage
were
half
a
dozen
men
and
women
whom
miss
winthrop
had
invited
to
act
as
judges
and
a
few
feet
from
them
in
a
chair
next
miss
winthrop
s
sat
old
madame
van
mater
the
owner
of
the
towers
and
the
donor
of
the
shakespeare
prize
her
appearance
at
the
commencement
had
been
a
surprise
to
everybody
but
whether
she
came
because
of
her
interest
in
her
granddaughter
or
whether
because
of
her
affection
for
miss
winthrop
no
one
had
been
told
when
winifred
graham
first
came
out
upon
the
stage
such
a
murmur
of
admiration
ran
through
the
audience
that
its
echo
reached
to
her
giving
her
just
the
confidence
she
had
needed
for
the
making
of
her
speech
and
truly
her
beauty
justified
the
admiration
for
she
was
wearing
the
costume
that
best
suited
her
and
was
most
effective
against
the
natural
background
of
evergreens
and
flowers
the
sunshine
falling
between
the
leaves
of
the
trees
overhead
touched
her
pale
blonde
hair
to
a
deeper
gold
making
fairy
shadow
patterns
on
the
pure
white
of
her
dress
without
a
trace
of
the
nervousness
that
had
haunted
her
upstairs
nor
a
moment
s
faltering
over
her
lines
winifred
recited
ophelia
s
famous
description
of
hamlet
ending
with
the
words
o
woe
is
me
to
have
seen
what
i
have
seen
see
what
i
then
for
just
a
moment
she
paused
with
a
pretty
pathetic
gesture
and
her
gaze
swept
the
faces
of
her
judges
before
she
vanished
from
the
stage
amid
much
clapping
of
hands
three
times
winifred
was
recalled
by
the
audience
and
at
each
call
gerry
s
heart
sank
lower
and
lower
in
her
pretty
boots
there
is
no
use
my
trying
now
she
grumbled
because
winifred
has
already
when
a
friend
standing
near
whispered
something
in
her
ear
she
laughed
in
her
usual
fashion
oh
yes
i
suppose
i
can
recite
better
than
winifred
but
what
avails
it
me
when
i
can
t
look
like
the
goddess
of
spring
as
she
does
at
this
moment
there
on
the
stage
with
her
arms
full
of
gerry
and
two
of
her
closest
friends
were
under
the
enclosed
arbor
in
the
spot
nearest
the
entrance
to
the
stage
as
her
recitation
came
next
and
a
few
feet
away
olive
closely
guarded
by
jean
was
also
waiting
hurriedly
jessica
hunt
rushed
in
whispering
something
to
jean
then
she
darted
across
to
gerry
winifred
is
coming
off
now
for
the
last
time
are
you
ready
winifred
looked
perfectly
lovely
but
she
did
not
speak
distinctly
enough
remember
it
is
difficult
to
hear
out
of
then
came
gerry
s
cue
a
little
nearsighted
without
her
glasses
she
tripped
over
some
branches
making
a
headlong
rush
on
to
the
stage
in
her
entrance
as
though
rosalind
really
trying
to
find
her
way
through
an
unknown
woods
had
stumbled
in
the
underbrush
no
one
had
ever
been
able
to
call
gerry
ferrows
handsome
and
yet
in
the
character
and
costume
of
rosalind
she
was
certainly
at
her
best
perhaps
the
description
that
the
heroine
gives
of
herself
in
masquerade
will
best
describe
gerry
s
present
appearance
more
than
common
tall
that
i
did
suit
me
all
points
like
a
man
a
gallant
curtle
axe
upon
my
thigh
a
in
my
hand
my
heart
lie
there
what
hidden
woman
s
fear
there
we
ll
have
a
swashing
and
a
martial
and
truly
if
gerry
did
feel
any
womanish
fear
during
her
recitation
she
did
not
in
any
way
betray
it
for
at
once
the
gayety
of
rosalind
her
wit
and
gallant
courage
seemed
to
have
fallen
like
a
mantle
upon
gerry
twice
her
audience
laughed
aloud
in
the
course
of
her
recitation
and
once
two
of
the
judges
nodded
at
each
other
which
had
not
happened
during
winifred
s
speech
nevertheless
though
gerry
came
twice
on
to
the
stage
again
to
receive
her
flowers
and
applause
she
was
certain
that
unless
olive
made
a
much
better
showing
than
she
had
winifred
would
be
the
winner
of
their
contest
for
some
unexplainable
reason
there
was
a
slight
wait
before
the
third
girl
who
was
to
close
the
competition
made
her
appearance
and
this
was
unfortunate
for
olive
in
the
first
place
the
large
audience
was
growing
a
little
bit
tired
and
hungry
and
in
the
second
place
it
gave
them
the
opportunity
to
begin
talking
of
olive
s
curious
history
retailing
to
one
another
as
much
or
as
little
as
each
one
of
them
knew
olive
s
costume
was
a
gift
from
ruth
and
jack
sent
from
new
york
and
shown
to
no
one
before
the
entertainment
save
jessica
hunt
and
miss
winthrop
no
one
will
ever
know
how
much
pleasure
the
planning
of
it
had
given
to
jack
ralston
in
the
tiresome
days
at
the
hospital
not
that
she
and
ruth
were
shakespeare
scholars
only
it
had
happened
that
years
before
ruth
had
seen
a
famous
actress
who
soon
afterwards
retired
from
the
stage
in
this
very
character
of
perdita
in
the
winter
s
tale
and
had
never
forgotten
the
details
of
her
dress
quietly
when
but
few
persons
were
looking
olive
at
last
skipped
on
to
the
stage
she
was
wearing
a
pale
pink
crepe
dress
that
came
down
to
her
ankles
covered
with
an
overdress
of
flowered
tulle
her
long
and
curiously
black
hair
was
braided
in
the
two
familiar
loose
braids
with
a
single
pink
flower
at
one
side
and
on
her
arm
she
carried
a
basket
of
spring
flowers
had
all
her
friends
and
acquaintances
not
been
convinced
from
the
first
that
olive
would
be
frightened
to
death
before
so
many
people
it
was
odd
therefore
that
as
she
first
came
down
toward
the
edge
of
the
platform
she
smiled
assurance
at
miss
winthrop
who
was
trying
her
best
not
to
appear
too
anxious
or
too
interested
in
her
favorite
pupil
then
olive
before
beginning
perdita
s
speech
started
slowly
to
dance
an
old
english
folk
dance
such
as
the
country
people
must
have
danced
in
rustic
england
long
before
even
shakespeare
s
time
dancing
was
an
art
with
olive
so
that
before
she
commenced
her
speech
her
audience
was
won
still
not
showing
the
least
trace
of
fright
or
nervousness
when
her
dance
was
concluded
olive
stepped
forward
again
to
the
center
of
the
stage
i
would
i
had
some
flowers
o
the
spring
that
might
become
your
time
of
day
and
yours
and
she
looked
from
one
face
to
the
other
in
the
rows
of
people
watching
her
as
though
addressing
perdita
s
pretty
speech
to
them
then
miss
winthrop
lost
her
color
and
old
madame
van
mater
stiffened
and
her
eyes
flashed
foolish
girl
she
has
forgotten
her
part
and
is
going
to
make
a
spectacle
of
herself
and
me
she
whispered
in
her
friend
s
ear
i
wish
i
had
never
and
apparently
olive
had
forgotten
her
lines
or
else
grown
suddenly
ill
for
she
continued
standing
perfectly
still
and
speechless
for
a
period
of
one
two
minutes
though
surely
it
seemed
like
ten
while
waves
of
color
swept
over
her
face
turning
it
crimson
and
then
leaving
it
pale
oh
i
can
not
believe
it
she
whispered
softly
to
herself
never
taking
her
eyes
from
a
central
place
in
the
audience
as
though
on
this
exquisite
may
morning
she
had
suddenly
seen
a
ghost
what
secret
message
traveled
across
the
heads
of
the
audience
to
the
girl
on
the
stage
no
one
knows
but
olive
must
have
caught
it
for
she
smiled
again
and
dipping
her
hand
in
her
basket
of
appeared
to
present
them
to
various
characters
who
in
shakespeare
s
play
stand
grouped
around
the
figure
of
perdita
as
she
makes
this
speech
daffodils
that
come
before
the
swallow
dares
and
take
the
winds
of
march
with
beauty
violets
dim
but
sweeter
than
the
lids
of
juno
s
eyes
or
cytherea
s
breath
pale
primroses
that
die
as
olive
spoke
slowly
she
drew
her
flowers
from
her
basket
dropping
them
to
the
ground
and
moving
gradually
backwards
toward
the
entrance
to
the
stage
then
when
she
had
recited
the
last
line
of
her
speech
she
made
a
quick
bow
and
before
her
audience
realized
that
her
speech
was
actually
over
had
disappeared
whether
the
applause
that
followed
after
her
equalled
winifred
s
and
gerry
s
she
did
not
know
and
at
the
moment
did
not
care
for
jean
was
waiting
only
a
few
yards
away
and
olive
rushed
to
her
at
once
oh
jean
dear
she
said
half
laughing
and
half
crying
i
didn
t
see
it
can
t
be
true
oh
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
before
because
we
did
not
want
you
to
be
too
excited
jean
answered
trying
to
speak
calmly
but
oh
olive
please
hurry
for
jack
wishes
you
to
come
to
her
at
chapter
xxv
jack
under
a
tall
linden
tree
shedding
its
yellowy
perfumed
blossoms
about
her
a
young
girl
stood
alone
waiting
she
was
pale
and
fragile
and
leaned
slightly
on
a
cane
her
hair
was
a
deep
bronze
the
color
of
copper
in
the
sunlight
and
her
gray
eyes
were
now
unusually
dark
with
emotion
she
was
evidently
trying
to
appear
less
disturbed
than
she
felt
for
her
head
was
tilted
back
the
least
bit
and
her
lips
were
held
close
together
indeed
her
whole
attitude
suggested
a
strong
effort
at
jack
two
figures
came
running
across
the
lawn
entirely
unconscious
of
the
number
of
persons
about
them
and
the
girl
in
the
costume
of
an
english
shepherdess
arrived
at
the
desired
goal
first
olive
there
are
no
adequate
words
that
can
be
spoken
on
first
meeting
after
a
long
separation
from
one
we
love
and
so
for
several
moments
the
two
ranch
girls
clung
together
trying
hard
to
keep
back
their
tears
while
jean
standing
a
little
apart
from
them
pretended
to
laugh
at
their
emotion
but
jack
you
are
well
why
didn
t
you
let
us
know
when
did
it
happen
there
are
so
many
things
i
want
to
ask
you
and
yet
i
don
t
care
whether
you
answer
me
or
not
i
am
so
glad
you
are
olive
said
at
last
perhaps
it
wasn
t
quite
fair
of
me
olive
to
have
taken
you
so
much
by
surprise
jean
and
frieda
had
a
few
days
of
warning
but
you
see
it
was
like
this
jack
explained
leaning
a
little
more
heavily
on
her
cane
although
neither
jean
nor
olive
noticed
it
when
my
operation
was
over
neither
the
surgeons
nor
anybody
knew
just
at
first
whether
or
not
i
was
to
get
well
so
of
course
ruth
did
not
wish
to
write
and
tell
you
until
we
were
certain
then
after
a
little
while
when
i
began
to
get
stronger
i
thought
how
i
should
love
to
surprise
you
by
appearing
out
here
at
primrose
hall
just
as
i
have
done
of
course
i
did
not
mean
to
put
off
coming
until
commencement
day
jack
continued
apologetically
but
somehow
i
did
not
get
well
quite
as
fast
as
i
expected
until
it
had
to
be
now
or
never
so
ruth
wrote
jean
and
frieda
to
expect
us
this
morning
but
not
to
let
you
know
for
we
were
afraid
that
seeing
me
would
somehow
affect
your
it
nearly
finished
it
altogether
olive
returned
just
think
how
i
felt
jack
when
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
my
poor
effort
i
saw
you
standing
straight
up
in
the
crowd
looking
just
as
you
used
to
i
shouldn
t
have
stood
up
ruth
tried
her
best
to
hide
me
only
i
got
so
jack
wavered
a
little
jean
of
course
i
am
perfectly
well
but
would
you
mind
getting
me
a
chair
i
am
not
accustomed
to
standing
so
feeling
dreadfully
ashamed
of
her
thoughtlessness
jean
hurried
off
returning
in
another
minute
empty
handed
but
following
close
behind
her
was
a
tall
man
in
a
costume
that
somehow
looked
a
little
out
of
place
at
primrose
hall
also
he
walked
with
a
freedom
and
power
that
did
not
speak
of
city
streets
neither
did
the
deep
tan
of
his
skin
he
was
carrying
the
big
comfortable
chair
for
jean
oh
jim
colter
i
don
t
think
it
fair
to
give
a
person
so
many
surprises
in
one
day
olive
protested
jim
colter
the
overseer
of
the
rainbow
ranch
and
the
manager
of
the
rainbow
mine
was
engaged
in
helping
jack
into
her
chair
so
that
he
could
not
at
once
shake
hands
with
olive
but
in
another
moment
his
big
hands
closed
over
hers
don
t
talk
about
surprises
miss
olive
van
mater
he
replied
to
think
i
used
to
laugh
at
all
the
yarns
in
the
story
books
and
here
i
was
raising
up
a
real
live
heroine
out
at
the
rainbow
ranch
whose
history
makes
most
of
the
fiction
tales
look
real
pale
but
ain
t
it
great
to
see
the
boss
herself
again
i
couldn
t
believe
she
was
getting
well
when
she
wrote
me
i
was
like
that
man
from
missouri
you
had
to
show
me
and
here
jim
put
his
hand
on
top
of
jack
s
uncovered
head
jim
colter
where
are
you
and
jack
and
everybody
a
new
voice
demanded
i
promised
to
let
jack
and
olive
have
just
five
minutes
together
alone
and
i
have
but
now
i
am
not
going
to
let
my
sister
get
out
of
my
sight
again
as
long
as
i
live
frieda
had
joined
the
little
group
under
the
linden
tree
just
as
jim
was
finishing
his
speech
and
before
olive
could
answer
him
now
olive
turned
again
to
jack
do
you
know
about
everything
my
grandmother
and
all
my
queer
history
she
asked
illustration
don
t
talk
about
jack
nodded
yes
olive
i
do
know
she
returned
and
i
am
awfully
glad
and
awfully
sorry
for
somehow
it
seems
to
make
you
belong
to
us
less
than
you
used
to
do
ruth
told
me
as
soon
as
she
thought
i
was
well
enough
to
hear
didn
t
you
know
that
i
have
even
had
a
letter
from
your
grandmother
thanking
me
for
rescuing
you
from
a
person
by
whom
she
had
been
deceived
meaning
old
laska
i
suppose
but
goodness
gracious
who
are
all
those
persons
coming
towards
us
now
half
a
dozen
persons
were
approaching
madame
van
mater
and
miss
winthrop
ruth
drew
and
gerry
ferrows
and
bringing
up
the
end
of
the
line
jessica
hunt
and
peter
drummond
smiling
at
one
another
and
apparently
unconscious
of
every
one
else
with
great
solemnity
introductions
were
soon
exchanged
and
then
immediately
afterwards
gerry
ferrows
slipped
over
next
olive
miss
winthrop
said
i
might
be
first
to
tell
you
that
you
have
received
the
shakespeare
prize
she
whispered
the
judges
voted
your
speech
the
most
effective
and
as
you
already
had
the
best
record
for
the
year
in
the
junior
shakespeare
class
why
of
course
the
honors
are
yours
and
i
want
to
congratulate
with
entire
good
feeling
gerry
put
forth
her
hand
toward
her
victorious
rival
but
olive
quickly
clasped
her
own
hands
behind
her
i
won
t
be
congratulated
gerry
and
i
won
t
have
a
prize
that
i
don
t
deserve
she
answered
tell
me
please
who
was
the
second
choice
i
was
or
at
least
the
judges
said
so
though
i
entirely
disagree
with
them
gerry
returned
blushing
furiously
for
olive
was
almost
forcibly
trying
to
drag
her
over
to
where
madame
van
mater
and
miss
winthrop
were
standing
together
yes
the
shakespeare
prize
is
to
be
yours
gerry
miss
winthrop
at
once
explained
olive
wanted
the
pleasure
of
trying
for
it
just
to
see
what
she
could
do
but
madame
van
mater
does
not
wish
the
prize
given
her
and
of
course
under
the
circumstances
olive
does
not
wish
it
ten
minutes
later
jean
frieda
olive
and
gerry
were
peremptorily
borne
away
by
a
number
of
their
classmates
later
on
from
a
kind
of
throne
on
one
of
the
primrose
hall
verandas
jack
and
some
of
her
friends
witnessed
the
pretty
ceremony
of
the
crowning
of
olive
as
queen
of
the
day
for
several
hours
afterwards
the
dancing
out
on
the
lawn
continued
olive
raising
a
silver
wand
as
a
signal
for
each
dance
to
begin
and
then
in
royal
fashion
leading
it
off
herself
four
or
five
times
during
the
afternoon
olive
and
donald
harmon
had
been
partners
once
when
jack
had
been
watching
them
she
happened
to
turn
to
speak
to
madame
van
mater
who
sat
next
her
but
whatever
she
may
have
intended
to
say
she
did
not
but
instead
waited
to
study
her
companion
s
expression
there
was
no
doubt
that
madame
van
mater
was
looking
distinctly
pleased
at
the
sight
of
olive
and
donald
together
for
there
was
almost
a
smile
of
satisfaction
on
her
face
watching
her
jack
flushed
biting
her
lips
then
she
leaned
over
and
spoke
you
are
very
good
madame
van
mater
to
be
willing
to
have
olive
go
home
with
us
to
our
ranch
this
summer
i
wonder
if
afterwards
you
will
do
something
that
is
kinder
still
she
asked
with
distinct
approval
madame
van
mater
regarded
jack
for
there
was
an
air
of
distinction
and
aristocracy
about
her
that
was
very
pleasing
it
was
katherine
winthrop
s
idea
that
i
should
not
interfere
with
my
granddaughter
s
liberty
at
present
she
replied
but
what
more
would
you
have
me
to
do
for
answer
jack
who
was
growing
weary
leaned
back
on
her
sofa
cushions
looking
out
over
the
garden
and
fields
to
where
afar
off
she
could
see
just
a
silver
line
marking
the
course
of
the
hudson
river
i
have
been
shut
up
inside
a
hospital
for
seven
months
madame
van
mater
she
explained
slowly
and
until
my
accident
i
don
t
believe
i
had
ever
been
indoors
hours
together
in
my
life
and
all
the
time
lately
i
have
been
thinking
and
longing
for
just
two
things
one
to
see
our
beloved
ranch
again
to
get
on
horseback
and
ride
for
miles
and
miles
over
the
prairie
and
and
then
old
madame
van
mater
repeated
with
more
interest
than
you
would
believe
she
could
show
jack
laughed
why
then
i
want
to
travel
as
far
and
as
fast
as
i
can
you
see
i
have
been
shut
in
so
long
and
some
days
i
used
to
think
perhaps
i
should
never
see
much
more
of
the
world
than
just
four
jack
shuddered
and
then
braced
her
shoulders
in
her
old
determined
way
but
i
am
well
now
and
as
the
doctors
don
t
wish
me
to
be
in
school
i
want
you
to
promise
to
let
olive
go
to
europe
with
jean
and
frieda
and
me
next
fall
europe
madame
van
mater
reflected
a
moment
an
excellent
idea
i
could
have
planned
nothing
better
for
olive
for
travel
and
experience
may
give
her
just
the
ease
and
culture
she
needs
but
who
will
look
after
you
at
this
moment
ruth
drew
slowly
approached
towards
jack
and
her
companion
she
too
was
looking
pale
and
worn
from
her
long
vigil
of
watching
but
she
smiled
as
jack
reaching
forth
took
tight
hold
of
her
hand
why
miss
drew
will
chaperon
us
of
course
she
answered
she
will
not
go
home
with
us
this
summer
but
she
has
promised
to
go
abroad
afterwards
and
to
stay
forever
if
we
before
ruth
could
do
more
than
make
a
conventional
reply
miss
winthrop
arriving
persuaded
her
old
friend
to
join
her
in
saying
farewell
to
her
guests
so
just
for
a
few
moments
as
all
their
friends
were
walking
about
in
the
great
garden
ruth
and
jack
were
once
more
left
alone
not
far
off
they
could
see
jim
colter
slowly
approaching
them
with
jean
and
frieda
holding
on
to
his
hands
like
little
girls
jack
looked
first
at
jim
and
then
turned
to
the
older
girl
at
her
side
i
am
so
sorry
ruth
she
said
perhaps
i
was
foolish
but
i
used
to
hope
in
those
long
empty
days
at
the
hospital
that
when
you
and
jim
saw
each
other
again
you
would
forget
what
has
separated
you
and
only
remember
you
care
for
one
another
somehow
when
one
has
been
very
ill
love
seems
the
only
thing
that
is
really
ruth
flushed
until
she
looked
like
the
old
ruth
of
those
last
weeks
at
the
ranch
before
jim
had
made
the
tragic
confession
of
his
past
fault
to
her
jim
does
not
care
for
me
any
more
jack
dear
she
whispered
although
no
one
was
near
enough
to
hear
he
has
not
spoken
to
me
alone
since
he
arrived
in
new
york
so
i
suppose
he
has
not
forgiven
my
hardness
and
narrowness
besides
men
forget
love
very
jack
shook
her
head
and
somehow
her
expression
was
happier
than
it
had
been
the
moment
before
ruth
s
speech
jim
does
not
forget
she
answered
he
is
the
faithfulest
tenderest
kindest
person
in
the
and
then
the
oldest
ranch
girl
sighed
dear
me
isn
t
it
the
horridest
thing
in
the
world
to
have
to
wait
for
the
nice
things
to
happen
she
asked
of
course
we
all
know
ruth
that
some
day
everything
will
turn
out
for
the
best
but
it
is
just
that
silly
old
indefinite
word
some
that
makes
the
waiting
so
the
next
volume
to
be
issued
in
the
ranch
girls
series
will
appear
under
the
title
of
the
ranch
girls
in
in
this
story
the
histories
of
the
four
girls
and
their
chaperon
will
be
more
fully
developed
for
having
put
childhood
and
school
life
behind
them
they
will
enter
that
broader
world
of
young
womanhood
where
romance
stands
ever
waiting
round
the
corner
