the
military

well
now
i
am
so
am
i
call
it
a
most
unusual
that
is
a
very
mild
term
to
be
applied
to
it
call
it
an
outrage
the
professor
has
deliberately
gone
to
work
to
disgrace
the
school
and
every
student
in
that
s
my
opinion
i
shall
give
my
father
a
full
history
of
the
case
in
the
next
letter
i
write
to
him
and
i
incline
to
the
belief
that
he
will
order
me
to
pack
my
trunk
and
start
for
i
know
that
is
what
my
father
will
do
why
fellows
just
think
of
it
for
a
moment
what
if
this
street
gamin
who
has
been
brought
here
as
the
professor
s
pet
should
accidentally
win
a
warrant
at
the
next
examination
or
a
commission
that
would
be
worse
yet
wouldn
t
a
gentleman
s
son
look
nice
obeying
his
orders
of
a
bootblack
i
ll
never
do
that
i
ll
stay
in
the
until
i
am
well
i
won
t
i
ll
go
home
this
conversation
took
place
one
cold
frosty
morning
in
the
latter
part
of
january
among
the
members
of
a
little
party
of
boys
who
were
walking
up
the
path
that
led
to
the
door
of
the
bridgeport
military
academy
there
were
a
dozen
of
them
in
all
and
their
ages
varied
from
thirteen
to
sixteen
years
they
looked
like
young
soldiers
dressed
as
they
were
in
their
neat
uniforms
of
cadet
gray
set
off
by
light
blue
trimmings
but
it
seems
that
they
were
anything
but
good
soldiers
just
then
for
their
words
indicated
a
determination
on
their
part
to
rebel
against
lawful
authority
the
bridgeport
military
school
was
a
wealthy
and
aristocratic
institution
it
was
modeled
after
the
school
at
the
point
and
although
its
course
of
study
differed
materially
from
that
pursued
at
the
national
academy
its
rules
of
discipline
were
almost
the
same
it
was
intended
to
fit
boys
for
college
for
business
for
civil
or
mining
engineering
or
for
west
point
if
they
wanted
to
go
there
and
could
command
influence
enough
to
secure
the
appointment
and
in
order
that
they
might
begin
early
in
life
to
realize
the
majesty
and
dignity
of
law
and
to
see
the
necessity
of
submitting
to
it
as
becomes
good
citizens
of
the
republic
they
were
put
through
a
course
of
military
drill
as
strict
as
that
to
which
they
would
have
been
subjected
if
they
had
been
private
soldiers
in
the
regular
army
the
majority
of
the
were
nearly
three
hundred
of
them
in
all
were
deeply
in
love
with
the
school
and
with
every
body
and
every
thing
connected
with
it
although
they
were
obliged
to
study
hard
for
seven
months
in
the
year
to
avoid
being
dropped
from
their
classes
and
to
watch
themselves
closely
in
order
to
keep
within
the
rules
they
were
allowed
two
seasons
of
rest
and
recreation
during
the
year
a
faithful
student
could
always
obtain
a
pass
for
an
evening
provided
his
standing
as
a
soldier
was
what
it
should
be
and
warrants
and
commissions
were
to
be
obtained
by
anybody
who
was
willing
to
work
for
them
more
than
that
the
institution
was
endeared
to
them
by
a
thousand
associations
the
fathers
of
some
of
the
present
students
had
sat
in
those
same
seats
pronounced
their
orations
from
that
very
rostrum
handled
those
same
muskets
and
swords
and
been
drilled
at
the
identical
guns
that
still
composed
the
battery
and
their
sons
had
heard
them
speak
in
the
highest
terms
of
the
benefits
derived
from
the
instructions
they
had
there
received
during
the
days
of
their
boyhood
under
these
circumstances
it
was
no
wonder
that
the
students
took
pride
in
their
school
and
that
the
most
of
them
had
come
there
with
the
determination
that
no
act
of
theirs
should
in
any
way
detract
from
its
high
and
reputation
but
if
these
were
the
sentiments
of
some
of
the
boys
there
was
a
small
but
busy
minority
who
cherished
feelings
that
were
exactly
the
who
had
been
sent
there
because
they
could
not
be
controlled
at
home
who
were
restive
under
the
restraints
that
were
imposed
upon
them
and
whose
sole
object
was
to
complete
the
course
and
get
away
from
the
school
with
as
little
trouble
to
themselves
as
possible
these
were
the
fellows
who
were
always
in
trouble
they
did
not
mind
their
hard
lessons
so
much
as
they
did
the
fatiguing
drills
with
muskets
and
broadswords
they
envied
the
officers
in
their
class
on
account
of
the
authority
they
possessed
the
extra
privileges
that
fell
to
their
lot
and
the
respect
they
demanded
from
the
rest
of
the
students
but
they
were
not
willing
to
work
for
a
commission
themselves
and
they
did
not
like
those
who
were
they
ran
the
guard
at
every
opportunity
to
eat
pancakes
with
cony
ryan
who
was
quite
as
important
a
personage
at
bridgeport
as
benny
havens
is
or
used
to
be
at
west
point
and
did
penance
for
it
the
next
saturday
by
performing
extra
duty
as
sentries
with
bricks
in
their
knapsacks
when
they
saluted
a
member
of
the
class
above
them
as
the
law
required
them
to
do
they
did
it
in
a
very
sullen
and
ungracious
manner
but
if
a
member
of
the
class
below
them
neglected
his
duty
in
this
respect
they
were
prompt
to
take
him
to
task
for
it
the
two
meanest
boys
in
school
were
tom
fisher
and
clarence
duncan
who
at
the
time
our
story
opens
had
been
members
of
the
academy
just
two
years
they
were
smart
enough
at
their
books
and
stood
well
in
their
classes
when
they
felt
in
the
humor
to
apply
themselves
but
their
record
as
soldiers
was
something
of
which
they
ought
to
have
been
ashamed
tom
to
put
it
in
plain
english
was
a
sneak
and
clarence
was
a
bully
who
boasted
of
his
ability
to
whip
any
boy
in
school
these
boys
had
a
good
many
adherents
among
the
students
and
if
there
were
any
mischief
done
about
the
village
it
was
pretty
certain
to
be
traced
home
to
them
the
two
seasons
of
rest
and
recreation
of
which
we
have
spoken
were
the
frolic
that
came
off
in
august
and
the
vacation
which
began
on
the
of
september
and
continued
until
the
of
january
then
the
boys
went
home
to
spend
the
holidays
and
show
their
uniforms
when
the
time
came
to
go
into
camp
no
one
was
excused
except
upon
the
surgeon
s
certificate
of
disability
in
fact
there
were
very
few
among
them
who
ever
asked
to
be
excused
even
the
most
studious
had
grown
tired
of
their
books
by
this
time
and
were
anxious
to
get
out
among
the
hills
where
they
could
breathe
invigorating
air
go
and
botanizing
and
in
various
other
ways
brace
up
their
nerves
in
readiness
for
the
searching
examination
that
was
to
be
held
immediately
on
their
return
to
the
academy
this
camp
was
intended
as
a
school
of
review
theory
was
reduced
to
practice
and
those
of
the
students
who
kept
their
eyes
and
ears
open
and
tried
to
profit
by
the
instructions
there
received
were
almost
sure
to
pass
the
examination
with
flying
colors
the
civil
engineers
surveyed
the
bar
in
the
river
just
as
their
fathers
had
done
before
them
staked
out
the
best
route
for
a
canal
around
the
falls
and
laid
out
a
railroad
and
got
everything
in
readiness
for
tunneling
the
hills
to
let
it
through
the
military
engineers
under
cover
of
a
hot
fire
of
blank
cartridges
from
the
battery
threw
pontoon
bridges
over
the
creek
and
when
they
were
finished
the
infantry
which
had
been
concealed
in
a
ravine
close
by
charged
across
them
and
swarmed
up
the
opposite
heights
to
dislodge
an
enemy
that
was
supposed
to
be
intrenched
there
they
fortified
the
hills
to
prevent
the
approach
of
an
invading
army
sent
out
scouts
to
scour
the
surrounding
country
held
drumhead
and
tried
everybody
who
was
reported
for
any
misdemeanor
in
fact
they
did
everything
that
soldiers
do
when
they
are
in
the
field
perhaps
two
or
three
days
would
be
spent
in
this
way
and
then
there
would
come
two
or
three
days
of
rest
during
which
the
young
soldiers
would
roam
about
the
woods
and
fields
going
wherever
their
fancy
led
them
when
the
examination
came
off
the
graduates
were
presented
with
their
diplomas
and
the
degrees
that
the
institution
was
empowered
to
confer
new
officers
were
appointed
from
among
the
students
the
classes
were
reorganized
new
applicants
were
received
and
everything
was
made
ready
for
work
at
the
beginning
of
the
new
school
year
at
the
time
of
which
we
write
the
school
had
been
in
session
about
two
weeks
two
hundred
and
fifty
of
the
old
students
had
returned
and
the
places
of
the
large
number
who
were
graduated
at
the
close
of
the
last
term
were
filled
by
the
second
class
which
became
the
first
the
third
became
the
second
the
fourth
became
the
third
and
the
new
fourth
was
made
up
of
the
plebes
who
had
signed
the
why
the
were
called
plebes
which
is
short
for
plebeians
it
is
hard
to
tell
perhaps
it
was
because
their
fathers
in
the
days
of
their
boyhood
had
given
that
name
to
all
new
scholars
or
it
may
have
been
for
the
reason
that
everybody
was
down
on
them
they
certainly
looked
out
of
place
there
they
still
wore
their
citizens
clothes
the
uniforms
for
which
they
had
been
measured
when
they
first
arrived
not
having
yet
been
received
they
were
not
allowed
to
go
on
because
they
could
not
handle
a
musket
and
as
they
had
not
yet
been
broken
in
they
were
a
little
too
independent
in
their
conduct
to
suit
the
old
students
who
exacted
the
greatest
show
of
respect
from
those
who
were
below
them
among
these
plebes
was
one
whose
advent
created
the
profoundest
astonishment
among
some
of
the
students
the
boys
we
have
already
introduced
to
the
reader
were
talking
about
him
as
they
came
up
the
path
they
were
tom
fisher
and
his
crowd
having
drawn
the
capes
of
their
overcoats
over
their
heads
they
were
strolling
leisurely
along
paying
no
heed
to
the
cutting
wind
that
swept
across
the
but
the
thinly
clad
young
fellow
who
came
up
the
path
behind
them
was
shivering
violently
under
its
influence
his
hands
and
face
were
blue
with
cold
and
his
feet
were
so
poorly
protected
that
he
was
obliged
to
stop
now
and
then
and
stamp
them
on
the
ground
to
get
them
warm
the
noise
he
made
attracted
the
attention
of
tom
fisher
and
his
companions
who
turned
to
see
what
had
occasioned
it
here
he
comes
now
exclaimed
dick
henderson
a
little
fellow
whose
mother
would
have
been
ashamed
of
him
if
she
had
known
what
sort
of
company
he
was
keeping
at
the
academy
say
you
fellow
where
are
your
manners
only
one
short
year
ago
dick
was
a
plebe
himself
but
now
he
was
a
third
class
boy
and
he
was
resolved
that
everybody
should
know
it
and
treat
him
accordingly
let
him
go
dick
said
tom
fisher
in
a
tone
of
disgust
you
would
be
highly
honored
by
a
salute
from
a
bootblack
wouldn
t
you
now
who
are
these
said
clarence
duncan
in
a
low
tone
tom
and
his
crowd
looked
down
the
path
and
saw
two
other
approaching
in
appearance
they
were
very
unlike
the
shivering
boy
who
had
just
gone
along
the
path
they
were
warmly
clad
wore
sealskin
caps
and
gloves
and
there
was
something
in
their
air
and
bearing
that
proclaimed
them
to
be
boys
who
respected
themselves
and
who
intended
that
others
should
respect
them
one
of
them
was
tall
and
and
carried
himself
as
though
he
had
never
been
in
the
habit
of
submitting
to
any
nonsense
and
the
other
was
small
slender
and
apparently
delicate
why
they
are
the
planter
and
his
brother
said
one
of
the
students
all
of
whom
had
had
opportunity
to
learn
more
or
less
of
the
history
of
the
boys
who
composed
the
fourth
class
they
re
from
mississippi
their
father
is
worth
no
end
of
money
and
they
say
he
gives
his
boys
a
very
liberal
then
they
ll
be
good
fellows
to
foot
the
bills
at
cony
ryan
s
will
they
not
said
fisher
they
say
that
the
little
one
is
a
saint
chimed
in
dick
henderson
he
never
does
anything
wrong
but
his
brother
must
be
a
brick
for
he
was
expelled
from
the
last
school
he
attended
on
account
of
some
violation
of
the
then
he
s
the
fellow
for
us
said
tom
fisher
we
must
make
it
a
point
to
see
him
after
the
near
approach
of
the
cut
short
the
conversation
tom
and
his
crowd
strolled
leisurely
on
filling
up
the
path
so
completely
that
it
was
impossible
for
any
one
to
pass
them
without
stepping
out
into
the
deep
snow
that
had
been
thrown
up
on
each
side
this
the
new
scholars
did
not
seem
inclined
to
do
the
smaller
one
came
up
behind
dick
henderson
and
placing
the
back
of
his
hand
against
his
arm
said
pleasantly
will
you
be
good
enough
to
give
us
a
little
room
tom
and
his
friends
faced
about
at
once
and
the
former
stepped
up
to
the
speaker
and
laid
his
hand
rather
heavily
on
his
shoulder
look
here
plebe
said
he
in
an
insolent
tone
subordination
is
of
discipline
the
root
when
you
address
an
old
cadet
forget
not
to
mind
that
in
take
your
hand
off
that
boy
or
i
will
salute
you
with
a
blow
in
the
face
that
will
bury
you
out
of
sight
in
that
snowdrift
said
he
who
had
been
called
the
who
are
you
demanded
fisher
take
a
good
look
at
me
so
that
you
will
remember
me
was
the
reply
the
boy
drew
off
his
gloves
and
pulled
down
his
muffler
revealing
the
familiar
features
of
our
old
friend
don
gordon
just
then
the
clear
notes
of
a
bugle
rang
out
on
the
frosty
air
it
was
the
study
call
and
all
the
students
within
hearing
made
haste
to
respond
to
it
chapter
ii
don
and
bert
at
school
don
gordon
and
his
brother
hubert
were
two
of
the
heroes
of
the
series
those
who
have
met
them
before
will
not
need
to
be
told
what
sort
of
boys
they
were
and
strangers
we
will
leave
to
do
as
the
boys
of
the
bridgeport
academy
acquainted
with
them
by
degrees
they
lived
near
the
little
town
of
rochdale
in
the
state
of
mississippi
where
their
father
owned
an
extensive
cotton
plantation
that
was
the
reason
why
the
students
who
had
a
new
name
for
every
called
don
the
planter
the
last
time
we
spoke
of
him
and
hubert
was
in
connection
with
the
building
of
a
on
the
site
of
the
one
that
had
been
burned
by
bob
owens
and
lester
brigham
we
then
informed
the
reader
that
the
new
structure
was
much
better
than
the
old
one
and
that
is
all
we
shall
say
about
it
until
such
time
as
the
owners
get
ready
to
take
possession
of
it
after
bob
owens
ran
away
from
home
to
become
a
hunter
and
godfrey
evans
and
his
son
dan
went
to
work
to
earn
an
honest
living
and
david
evans
became
and
lester
brigham
withdrew
himself
from
the
society
of
the
boys
in
the
neighborhood
the
inhabitants
of
rochdale
and
the
surrounding
country
settled
back
into
their
old
ways
and
waited
for
something
to
happen
that
would
create
an
excitement
they
marveled
greatly
at
the
sudden
change
that
had
taken
place
in
godfrey
and
dan
talked
of
the
indomitable
courage
bob
owens
had
displayed
on
the
night
the
steamer
sam
kendall
was
burned
and
cast
jealous
eyes
upon
david
evans
who
they
thought
was
making
money
a
little
too
rapidly
and
throwing
on
a
few
more
airs
than
were
becoming
in
a
boy
who
had
a
woodchopper
and
a
lazy
and
worthless
one
at
that
for
a
father
rochdale
was
like
some
other
country
towns
that
you
may
have
heard
of
the
people
most
of
whom
had
been
impoverished
by
the
war
were
envious
of
one
another
though
outwardly
they
were
friendly
and
all
one
had
to
do
to
gain
enemies
was
to
be
successful
if
he
made
money
one
year
by
planting
potatoes
when
the
next
season
came
around
everybody
planted
potatoes
if
he
set
up
a
blacksmith
shop
or
opened
a
store
and
seemed
to
be
prospering
some
one
was
sure
to
start
opposition
to
him
when
david
evans
began
riding
the
mail
route
for
don
gordon
s
father
who
had
the
contract
and
exchanged
his
rags
for
warm
and
durable
clothing
and
purchased
a
fine
horse
for
himself
there
were
a
good
many
who
thought
that
he
was
getting
on
in
the
world
altogether
too
fast
his
most
bitter
enemy
was
owens
who
had
tried
so
hard
to
secure
the
contract
for
his
son
bob
the
runaway
he
generally
rode
a
very
dilapidated
specimen
of
and
whenever
david
passed
him
on
the
road
mounted
on
his
colt
owens
always
felt
as
though
he
wanted
to
knock
him
out
of
his
saddle
just
look
at
that
beggar
on
horseback
he
would
say
to
himself
things
have
come
to
a
pretty
pass
when
white
trash
like
that
can
hold
their
heads
so
high
in
the
air
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
him
and
that
meddlesome
gordon
bob
might
have
been
riding
that
route
now
instead
of
roaming
about
the
world
nobody
knows
where
if
the
opportunity
ever
presents
itself
i
ll
get
even
with
both
of
them
for
that
piece
of
as
for
don
and
bert
they
hardly
knew
what
to
do
with
themselves
their
private
tutor
left
a
northern
man
he
could
not
stand
the
then
they
were
as
uneasy
as
fish
out
of
their
native
element
they
galloped
their
ponies
about
the
country
in
search
of
adventure
paddled
around
the
lake
in
their
canoe
roamed
listlessly
through
the
woods
with
their
guns
in
their
hands
in
short
to
quote
from
don
they
became
as
shiftless
and
of
as
little
use
in
the
world
as
ever
godfrey
evans
had
i
don
t
at
all
like
this
thing
the
general
one
day
said
to
his
wife
and
there
must
be
a
stop
put
to
it
the
boys
will
grow
up
as
ignorant
as
the
negroes
i
shall
pack
them
both
off
to
gordon
thought
of
the
way
in
which
don
had
conducted
himself
at
the
last
school
he
attended
he
had
been
expelled
from
it
on
account
of
the
scrapes
that
his
inordinate
love
of
mischief
brought
him
into
and
made
no
reply
i
have
not
forgotten
that
unfortunate
occurrence
said
the
general
who
well
knew
what
was
passing
in
his
wife
s
mind
but
i
think
it
was
a
lesson
to
don
and
one
that
will
never
fade
from
his
memory
being
blessed
with
wonderful
health
and
strength
he
is
fairly
overflowing
with
animal
spirits
and
some
of
his
surplus
energy
must
be
worked
off
in
some
way
i
ll
put
him
where
he
will
be
held
with
his
nose
close
to
the
grindstone
i
ll
send
him
to
do
you
think
he
can
endure
the
discipline
asked
the
anxious
mother
who
knew
how
easily
don
could
be
governed
by
kindness
and
how
obstinate
he
was
under
harsh
treatment
he
ll
have
to
it
is
just
what
he
needs
after
he
has
spent
six
hours
in
racking
his
brain
over
the
hardest
kind
of
problems
in
mathematics
and
two
hours
and
a
half
more
in
handling
muskets
and
broadswords
under
the
eye
of
a
strict
drillmaster
he
will
feel
more
like
going
to
bed
than
he
will
like
running
the
guard
to
eat
cony
ryan
s
pancakes
and
drink
his
sour
buttermilk
i
know
for
i
have
been
right
when
general
gordon
once
made
up
his
mind
to
a
course
of
action
he
lost
no
time
in
carrying
it
into
effect
before
the
week
was
passed
he
and
his
two
boys
were
on
their
way
to
bridgeport
where
they
arrived
in
time
to
learn
something
of
the
life
the
students
led
while
they
were
in
camp
the
veteran
superintendent
welcomed
the
general
as
an
old
friend
and
pupil
received
him
and
his
boys
into
his
marquee
and
took
pains
to
see
that
the
latter
made
some
agreeable
acquaintances
among
the
members
of
the
first
class
who
showed
them
every
thing
there
was
to
be
seen
bert
did
not
have
much
to
say
but
don
was
all
enthusiasm
that
s
the
school
for
me
said
he
to
his
father
when
they
were
on
their
way
to
rochdale
after
don
and
bert
had
passed
their
examination
and
been
admitted
as
members
of
the
academy
how
nicely
those
fellows
were
drilled
and
what
gentlemen
all
the
instructors
are
we
shall
have
easy
times
during
the
first
year
it
will
seem
like
play
for
me
to
go
back
to
the
beginning
of
algebra
the
general
smiled
but
said
nothing
until
they
reached
home
and
the
boys
began
to
get
ready
to
go
back
to
the
academy
at
the
beginning
of
the
school
year
then
he
tried
to
make
them
understand
that
easy
times
were
entirely
unknown
in
bridgeport
that
the
instructors
although
they
were
enough
to
the
guests
they
met
while
in
camp
were
the
sternest
and
most
inflexible
of
disciplinarians
in
the
barracks
and
that
there
was
as
wide
a
gulf
between
them
and
the
students
as
there
was
between
the
officers
and
privates
in
the
army
somehow
don
could
not
bring
himself
to
believe
it
but
before
many
months
more
had
passed
over
his
head
he
found
out
that
his
father
knew
what
he
was
talking
about
he
made
his
mother
the
most
solemn
promises
in
regard
to
his
behavior
assuring
her
that
he
had
been
in
scrapes
enough
and
that
henceforth
he
would
give
her
and
his
teachers
no
trouble
and
when
he
made
those
promises
he
was
fully
resolved
to
live
up
to
them
he
was
then
entirely
unacquainted
with
the
temptations
that
fell
to
the
lot
of
a
bridgeport
student
cony
ryan
s
pancakes
and
surreptitious
had
no
charms
for
him
neither
had
the
and
extra
duty
any
terrors
because
he
did
not
know
that
there
were
any
such
things
but
they
were
soon
brought
to
his
notice
and
perhaps
we
shall
see
how
he
kept
his
promises
after
that
the
night
of
the
of
january
found
don
and
bert
installed
in
their
room
in
the
academy
it
was
large
enough
to
accommodate
two
single
beds
a
a
washstand
a
table
and
two
chairs
at
the
foot
of
each
bed
was
a
small
cupboard
in
which
they
were
to
keep
their
uniforms
after
they
got
them
and
also
their
officers
swords
if
they
were
fortunate
enough
to
win
them
at
the
next
examination
bert
was
poring
over
his
french
lesson
while
don
who
was
more
than
a
year
ahead
of
his
class
in
all
his
studies
was
reading
the
rules
and
regulations
that
hung
upon
the
wall
there
were
fifty
rooms
on
that
floor
all
occupied
by
boys
who
were
supposed
to
be
studying
their
lessons
for
the
morrow
the
only
sound
that
broke
the
stillness
was
a
steady
tramping
in
the
hall
i
wish
that
fellow
whoever
he
is
would
go
into
his
room
and
keep
still
said
bert
after
he
had
waited
a
long
time
for
the
tramping
to
cease
he
ll
not
go
away
until
he
is
relieved
replied
don
he
is
a
sentry
i
have
just
been
reading
about
him
he
has
charge
of
all
the
rooms
on
this
floor
and
it
is
his
duty
to
suppress
all
loud
talking
or
laughing
and
to
inspect
the
rooms
occasionally
to
see
that
the
occupants
have
not
slipped
where
would
they
go
if
they
did
slip
out
asked
bert
i
am
sure
i
don
t
know
replied
don
as
he
walked
up
to
the
heater
and
held
his
hands
over
it
neither
do
i
see
why
one
should
want
to
leave
a
comfortable
room
like
this
to
parade
around
in
the
deep
snow
even
if
there
a
place
to
go
to
pass
the
evening
it
s
fearful
cold
up
here
in
this
country
isn
t
it
when
don
and
bert
left
their
southern
home
the
air
was
balmy
the
birds
were
singing
a
few
early
flowers
were
beginning
to
bud
under
the
genial
influence
of
the
sun
and
they
earned
their
overcoats
done
up
in
but
long
before
they
reached
their
journey
s
end
they
had
put
on
all
their
heaviest
clothing
and
when
the
train
brought
them
into
bridgeport
they
found
the
streets
blocked
with
snow
and
the
river
covered
with
a
sheet
of
ice
that
was
fourteen
inches
in
thickness
the
dreary
winter
scene
that
met
their
gaze
every
time
they
looked
out
of
the
academy
windows
made
them
shiver
involuntarily
and
it
was
no
wonder
that
they
wanted
to
hug
the
fire
suppose
that
sentry
should
find
a
room
empty
when
he
looked
into
it
said
bert
without
replying
to
his
brother
s
question
what
then
it
would
be
his
duty
to
report
the
owners
said
don
that
looks
almost
too
much
like
answered
bert
i
don
t
like
the
idea
do
you
no
i
don
t
but
what
is
a
fellow
to
do
about
it
if
it
ever
comes
our
turn
to
stand
sentry
during
study
hours
we
can
take
our
choice
between
doing
our
full
duty
without
fear
or
favor
and
being
reported
and
punished
ourselves
for
negligence
i
know
what
my
choice
will
be
if
the
boys
don
t
want
me
to
report
them
they
must
live
up
to
the
when
don
said
this
he
meant
every
word
of
it
but
after
he
had
been
at
the
academy
a
few
weeks
bert
noticed
that
he
never
gave
expression
to
such
ideas
as
these
he
learned
how
to
keep
his
back
turned
toward
a
room
when
he
had
reason
to
believe
that
the
owners
desired
to
take
french
for
the
evening
and
when
he
was
certain
that
they
were
out
of
harm
s
way
he
could
open
the
door
of
that
very
room
and
without
much
stretching
of
his
imagination
convert
the
dummies
that
occupied
the
beds
into
living
breathing
students
it
soon
became
known
to
a
certain
class
of
boys
that
the
planter
was
a
brick
who
would
rather
get
into
trouble
himself
than
report
any
of
his
schoolmates
and
they
were
not
slow
to
take
advantage
of
his
that
was
the
term
the
students
applied
to
his
neglect
of
duty
but
the
superintendent
called
it
disobedience
of
orders
and
don
was
punished
accordingly
what
was
that
noise
exclaimed
bert
suddenly
it
sounded
like
a
drum
answered
don
and
that
was
just
what
it
was
a
couple
of
drummers
were
walking
around
the
building
every
now
and
then
giving
their
instruments
a
single
tap
it
certainly
means
something
said
bert
with
no
little
anxiety
in
his
tone
but
i
am
all
in
the
so
was
don
he
was
about
to
propose
that
they
should
step
out
into
the
hall
and
ask
the
sentry
to
enlighten
them
when
the
door
suddenly
opened
and
that
dreaded
functionary
thrust
his
head
into
the
room
i
say
plebe
he
exclaimed
nodding
to
don
give
us
your
name
will
you
don
wonderingly
complied
and
the
sentry
drew
a
from
his
pocket
and
wrote
something
in
it
very
unpleasant
piece
of
business
said
he
but
it
can
t
be
helped
orders
are
orders
as
you
will
find
before
you
have
been
here
a
great
while
next
time
keep
your
ears
why
what
s
the
matter
inquired
don
have
we
done
anything
wrong
i
should
say
so
why
didn
t
you
douse
your
glim
did
you
not
hear
the
signal
we
heard
a
drum
if
that
s
what
you
mean
said
bert
that
was
taps
and
it
meant
lights
put
that
lamp
out
at
we
ll
do
it
just
as
soon
as
we
get
ready
for
bed
replied
bert
jumping
up
and
pulling
off
his
coat
put
it
out
i
tell
you
exclaimed
the
sentry
put
it
out
and
undress
in
the
dark
as
the
rest
of
the
fellows
do
you
had
better
take
my
advice
and
slumber
lightly
for
after
the
morning
gun
is
fired
you
will
have
just
six
minutes
in
which
to
get
into
your
clothes
and
fall
in
for
pleasant
humph
said
bert
as
the
sentry
closed
the
door
and
went
out
into
the
hall
to
inspect
the
other
rooms
how
can
a
fellow
s
dreams
be
pleasant
when
he
knows
that
he
is
going
to
be
reported
in
the
morning
this
is
a
bad
beginning
don
although
we
have
not
been
here
hours
we
have
got
ourselves
into
trouble
this
reflection
worried
bert
who
always
tried
hard
to
obey
the
rules
of
the
school
he
attended
and
considered
himself
disgraced
if
he
were
taken
to
task
for
violating
any
of
them
but
it
had
no
more
effect
upon
don
than
water
has
on
a
duck
s
back
he
tumbled
into
bed
and
slept
soundly
while
bert
who
was
very
much
afraid
that
he
might
not
hear
the
morning
gun
lay
awake
during
the
greater
part
of
the
night
toward
morning
he
sank
into
a
troubled
slumber
from
which
the
solemn
booming
of
the
aroused
him
he
and
don
were
out
on
the
floor
and
putting
on
their
clothes
before
the
reverberations
that
came
from
the
hills
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
had
fairly
died
away
there
was
no
time
lost
in
stretching
and
a
second
wasted
in
waking
up
the
drums
were
beating
in
the
and
the
fifes
were
shrilly
piping
forth
the
first
strains
of
the
three
tunes
that
constituted
the
morning
call
before
the
second
tune
was
finished
don
and
bert
following
the
lead
of
the
crowd
of
students
they
found
in
the
hall
ran
into
the
and
took
their
places
in
line
there
were
four
companies
in
all
each
one
numbering
when
the
school
was
full
members
they
were
all
officered
by
boys
the
highest
in
rank
being
the
while
the
superintendent
of
the
academy
or
one
of
the
instructors
acted
as
commandant
of
the
battalion
the
companies
were
drawn
up
on
the
four
sides
of
the
spacious
in
which
all
the
battalion
and
company
exercises
and
ceremonies
were
held
during
bad
weather
the
members
standing
at
parade
in
front
of
each
company
stood
the
upright
soldierly
figure
of
the
first
sergeant
in
hand
behind
him
stood
his
boy
captain
while
the
officer
of
the
day
his
arms
folded
across
his
breast
critically
surveyed
the
scene
from
his
post
near
the
door
the
instant
the
last
notes
of
the
reveille
died
away
business
commenced
attention
company
shouted
all
the
first
sergeants
in
a
breath
whereupon
the
students
brought
their
heels
in
line
dropped
their
hands
by
their
side
turned
their
eyes
to
the
front
and
assumed
the
position
of
a
soldier
the
roll
was
called
in
less
than
two
minutes
and
after
the
first
sergeants
had
reported
to
their
captains
and
the
captains
had
reported
to
the
adjutant
and
the
adjutant
had
reported
to
the
officer
of
the
day
whose
duty
it
was
to
report
the
absentees
to
the
superintendent
the
guards
for
the
day
were
detailed
the
ranks
were
broken
and
the
students
hurried
away
to
wash
their
hands
and
faces
comb
their
hair
and
put
their
rooms
in
order
for
morning
inspection
after
that
came
two
hours
of
hard
study
then
the
was
sounded
followed
shortly
afterward
by
the
enlivening
strains
of
peas
upon
the
trencher
which
was
the
summons
to
breakfast
the
different
companies
were
marched
to
and
from
the
by
their
and
when
the
ranks
were
broken
the
students
were
allowed
an
hour
to
brush
up
on
their
lessons
for
the
day
or
to
stroll
about
the
grounds
and
watch
at
nine
o
clock
the
bugle
called
them
to
their
respective
and
from
that
time
until
one
they
were
kept
at
work
at
their
books
after
dinner
an
hour
was
allowed
for
rest
and
recreation
from
two
until
three
there
were
more
recitations
followed
by
a
long
and
fatiguing
drill
and
then
liberty
until
sunset
then
came
the
of
the
battalion
and
when
that
was
ended
the
day
s
work
was
over
with
everybody
except
the
guards
and
those
who
were
behind
with
their
lessons
for
the
next
day
after
supper
and
another
hour
of
recreation
the
bugle
called
to
quarters
and
that
was
a
sound
that
nobody
liked
to
hear
it
meant
that
all
the
fun
was
over
for
that
day
that
every
boy
must
go
to
his
room
at
once
and
keep
quiet
after
he
got
there
under
penalty
of
being
reported
by
the
sentry
who
had
charge
of
that
floor
after
this
description
of
the
routine
of
study
and
drill
that
was
pursued
at
the
academy
the
reader
will
understand
how
don
gordon
passed
the
most
of
his
during
the
next
four
years
how
he
passed
his
vacations
it
is
the
purpose
of
this
series
of
books
to
relate
it
will
be
seen
also
that
he
was
allowed
very
little
time
in
which
to
study
up
plans
for
mischief
in
fact
he
did
not
think
of
such
a
thing
for
he
had
come
there
firmly
resolved
to
do
his
best
and
to
win
a
record
for
himself
that
his
father
should
be
proud
of
but
still
he
did
feel
very
revengeful
while
he
and
his
brother
were
standing
in
front
of
the
superintendent
s
desk
listening
to
the
sharp
reprimand
that
was
administered
to
them
for
neglecting
to
extinguish
their
light
at
taps
this
was
the
same
gentleman
who
had
greeted
them
and
their
father
so
cordially
when
they
visited
his
camp
during
the
previous
summer
but
he
did
not
talk
as
he
did
then
he
used
cutting
words
and
laid
down
the
law
in
tones
that
had
made
more
than
one
culprit
tremble
don
did
not
mind
it
in
the
least
for
he
was
used
to
being
scolded
by
his
teachers
but
when
he
saw
how
bert
took
it
to
heart
he
became
so
angry
that
he
could
hardly
hold
his
peace
that
s
just
the
kind
of
a
man
that
i
like
to
get
the
advantage
of
said
he
to
himself
and
if
i
had
a
few
good
fellows
to
help
me
i
would
set
him
and
his
rules
at
defiance
i
just
know
i
could
slip
out
of
my
room
and
get
off
the
grounds
at
night
and
if
i
had
any
place
to
go
to
spend
the
evening
i
would
try
it
and
see
what
he
would
do
about
don
made
this
up
all
out
of
his
own
head
he
had
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
as
running
the
guard
and
he
thought
of
it
now
simply
as
a
daring
exploit
and
one
that
he
would
undertake
without
a
moment
s
hesitation
if
there
were
anything
to
be
gained
by
it
he
was
in
just
the
right
humor
to
be
manipulated
by
such
fellows
as
fisher
and
duncan
and
into
their
hands
he
fell
before
he
had
worn
the
academy
uniform
hours
they
took
him
up
because
they
hated
him
and
wanted
to
get
him
into
trouble
and
it
was
only
by
an
unexpected
stroke
of
good
fortune
that
he
escaped
from
their
clutches
what
he
did
to
arouse
their
animosity
shall
be
told
further
on
chapter
iii
hazing
a
we
ll
settle
with
you
at
some
future
time
my
fine
gentleman
said
tom
fisher
as
he
and
his
companions
ran
toward
the
academy
in
obedience
to
the
call
of
the
bugle
they
had
spent
the
hour
after
breakfast
in
strolling
about
the
grounds
discussing
the
history
of
one
of
the
new
students
as
we
have
related
in
the
first
chapter
all
right
replied
don
gordon
winking
at
his
brother
who
laid
his
finger
on
his
lips
and
shook
his
head
warningly
whenever
you
want
to
see
me
just
send
me
word
and
i
will
be
on
you
may
get
some
of
that
independence
whipped
out
of
you
before
you
have
been
here
many
more
days
chimed
in
clarence
duncan
who
ll
do
it
asked
don
cheerfully
will
replied
duncan
in
savage
tones
o
you
can
t
it
s
bred
in
the
bone
but
i
ll
tell
you
one
and
your
partner
there
added
don
nodding
his
head
toward
tom
fisher
you
want
to
keep
your
hands
off
my
brother
or
i
ll
make
of
the
pair
of
well
that
beats
anything
i
ever
heard
of
exclaimed
dick
henderson
opening
his
eyes
in
surprise
you
have
good
cheek
to
talk
of
making
of
such
fellows
as
fisher
and
duncan
haven
t
you
now
do
you
think
so
little
one
asked
don
as
he
said
this
he
patted
dick
on
the
head
in
a
most
patronizing
action
on
his
part
that
caused
dick
to
jump
aside
and
bristle
up
like
a
bantam
that
had
been
poked
with
a
stick
well
you
hang
around
and
you
will
see
it
done
unless
they
take
my
advice
and
mind
their
own
business
added
don
fisher
and
duncan
did
not
have
an
opportunity
to
reply
to
this
threat
for
just
then
they
reached
the
door
and
found
one
of
the
teachers
standing
there
they
were
somewhat
behind
time
and
they
were
obliged
to
hasten
to
their
dormitories
and
take
off
their
caps
and
overcoats
so
that
they
could
march
to
their
with
their
classes
they
looked
daggers
at
don
as
they
went
up
the
stairs
but
he
smiled
back
at
them
in
the
most
unconcerned
manner
possible
i
knew
he
was
a
tough
one
the
moment
i
put
my
eyes
on
him
said
fisher
that
night
after
drill
hours
when
he
and
about
fifty
other
students
were
exercising
their
muscles
in
the
gymnasium
there
isn
t
another
fellow
in
school
who
can
do
the
subject
of
these
remarks
was
don
gordon
who
had
just
come
out
dressed
in
neat
trunks
and
tights
his
arms
were
bare
to
the
shoulder
revealing
muscles
at
which
the
boys
around
him
gazed
in
admiration
his
first
act
was
to
walk
up
to
the
nearest
swing
take
hold
of
one
of
the
rings
and
draw
himself
up
to
his
chin
twice
in
succession
with
one
hand
i
tell
you
duncan
you
had
better
let
him
alone
continued
fisher
still
watching
don
who
was
now
going
hand
over
hand
up
a
rope
toward
the
lofty
ceiling
and
swallow
everything
he
said
to
me
this
morning
exclaimed
the
bully
no
i
didn
t
mean
that
fisher
hastened
to
reply
those
insulting
remarks
must
of
course
be
taken
back
and
apologized
for
but
you
can
t
make
him
do
it
just
give
me
the
chance
and
i
ll
show
you
whether
i
can
or
not
answered
duncan
who
was
always
angry
whenever
there
was
any
imputation
cast
upon
his
prowess
he
has
come
here
intending
to
set
at
naught
all
the
customs
of
the
t
you
noticed
how
persistently
he
refuses
to
salute
everybody
but
an
officer
if
we
are
willing
to
stand
by
and
let
him
do
it
i
say
we
are
a
pack
of
cowards
he
must
be
made
to
come
down
from
his
high
and
he
shall
be
said
fisher
encouragingly
we
will
attend
to
that
bootblack
s
case
and
the
first
good
chance
we
get
we
ll
take
gordon
in
hand
by
the
way
the
two
boys
drew
off
on
one
side
and
entered
into
a
whispered
consultation
now
and
then
beckoning
to
one
or
another
of
their
friends
until
there
were
a
dozen
or
more
students
gathered
about
them
they
conversed
earnestly
together
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
put
on
their
clothes
and
left
the
gymnasium
don
and
bert
gordon
followed
them
soon
after
and
on
giving
their
names
to
the
orderly
in
the
hall
were
admitted
to
the
presence
of
the
superintendent
after
they
had
both
saluted
him
don
said
colonel
we
have
brought
with
us
a
letter
of
introduction
from
our
father
addressed
to
packard
who
is
a
relative
of
one
of
our
nearest
neighbors
and
if
you
have
no
objections
we
should
like
permission
to
present
it
certainly
said
the
superintendent
as
he
picked
up
a
pen
and
pulled
a
sheet
of
paper
toward
him
you
can
go
immediately
after
supper
and
i
will
write
you
a
pass
you
ought
to
have
presented
it
when
you
first
came
why
did
you
put
it
off
so
long
know
sir
that
we
received
a
reprimand
on
the
morning
following
our
arrival
here
for
not
putting
out
our
light
at
ten
o
clock
faltered
don
and
i
was
afraid
you
would
think
we
ought
to
stay
inside
the
grounds
until
we
had
learned
to
obey
the
ah
yes
said
the
superintendent
with
a
smile
i
believe
i
remember
something
about
that
well
it
did
you
good
did
it
not
you
haven
t
been
reported
since
i
hope
your
record
at
the
end
of
your
course
will
be
as
good
as
that
of
your
father
who
i
must
say
was
a
very
exemplary
student
it
is
true
that
he
did
run
the
guard
now
and
then
the
temptations
at
cony
ryan
s
proving
rather
too
strong
for
him
and
when
he
was
here
with
you
last
august
i
think
he
told
me
that
while
he
was
a
member
of
my
school
he
spent
saturdays
in
walking
extras
but
for
all
that
he
was
a
good
good
boy
here
s
your
don
expressed
his
thanks
for
the
favor
and
he
and
bert
saluted
and
retired
lost
in
wonder
running
the
guard
repeated
the
former
in
a
loud
tone
what
does
that
mean
what
s
walking
an
extra
said
bert
in
the
same
low
voice
and
who
is
cony
ryan
here
comes
egan
we
ll
ask
him
said
don
the
individual
referred
to
was
a
boy
and
the
first
sergeant
of
don
s
company
when
he
was
on
duty
he
was
a
soldier
all
over
but
during
the
hours
of
recreation
he
was
as
jovial
and
friendly
a
fellow
as
there
was
to
be
found
about
the
academy
say
sergeant
said
don
not
forgetting
to
salute
what
does
a
cadet
do
when
he
runs
the
guard
what
does
he
do
repeated
the
sergeant
why
he
spends
a
good
portion
of
the
next
saturday
afternoon
in
walking
an
extra
to
pay
for
i
mean
how
does
he
run
the
guard
explained
don
now
gordon
isn
t
that
just
the
least
know
said
the
sergeant
laying
his
finger
by
the
side
of
his
nose
and
looking
very
wise
you
surely
don
t
expect
me
to
tell
you
how
it
is
done
do
you
you
had
better
ask
fisher
or
duncan
or
some
of
that
crowd
they
have
had
considerable
experience
in
we
want
to
know
what
the
meaning
of
the
expression
is
said
bert
o
that
s
it
well
when
a
fellow
slips
out
of
his
room
gets
off
the
grounds
without
being
caught
and
comes
back
in
the
morning
in
time
to
fall
in
and
answer
to
we
call
that
running
the
guard
by
walking
an
extra
we
mean
doing
additional
guard
duty
the
reason
that
saturday
is
selected
as
a
day
of
punishment
is
because
the
afternoon
is
given
over
almost
entirely
to
recreation
but
those
who
have
been
arrested
while
attempting
to
run
the
guard
or
who
have
been
caught
in
other
acts
of
disobedience
are
not
allowed
to
take
advantage
of
those
hours
of
recreation
because
they
have
already
had
their
fun
understand
don
said
he
did
and
then
he
inquired
who
cony
ryan
was
and
what
he
did
to
tempt
the
boys
cony
ryan
repeated
the
sergeant
his
eyes
growing
brighter
and
a
smile
overspreading
his
face
as
the
memory
of
old
times
came
back
to
him
why
he
is
a
part
of
the
academy
and
i
have
seen
the
day
when
i
thought
we
could
not
possibly
get
along
without
him
he
keeps
a
neat
little
house
down
by
the
big
pond
where
he
serves
up
the
best
pancakes
ever
ate
his
mince
and
pumpkin
pies
top
the
heap
and
as
for
his
maple
the
sergeant
walked
off
smacking
his
lips
and
don
and
bert
kept
on
up
the
stairs
i
rather
think
egan
has
been
there
observed
the
latter
i
know
he
has
replied
don
and
the
taste
of
that
maple
syrup
clings
to
his
palate
on
entering
their
room
don
threw
himself
into
a
chair
stretched
his
legs
out
before
him
buried
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
gazed
down
at
the
floor
in
a
brown
study
while
bert
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
table
rested
his
chin
on
his
hands
and
looked
at
him
presently
don
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
so
loudly
and
heartily
that
his
brother
was
obliged
to
laugh
too
i
never
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
said
bert
who
knew
what
was
passing
in
don
s
mind
no
more
did
i
just
think
how
that
dignified
father
of
ours
must
have
looked
running
the
guard
and
standing
punishment
for
it
afterward
he
took
good
care
not
to
say
a
word
to
us
about
it
didn
t
he
i
say
bert
exclaimed
don
suddenly
and
then
he
as
suddenly
paused
don
t
you
do
it
said
bert
earnestly
you
will
be
certain
to
get
yourself
into
trouble
by
if
i
did
i
should
be
perfectly
willing
to
take
the
consequences
but
father
couldn
t
haul
me
over
the
coals
for
it
could
he
if
father
were
here
now
he
wouldn
t
think
of
doing
such
neither
would
i
if
i
were
a
but
you
won
t
go
to
cony
ryan
s
will
you
pleaded
bert
of
course
not
don
t
borrow
any
trouble
on
that
score
i
promised
mother
that
i
would
behave
myself
and
i
am
going
to
do
it
but
i
should
like
to
taste
those
pies
and
pancakes
all
the
same
added
don
to
himself
that
evening
after
supper
don
and
bert
showed
their
pass
to
the
sentry
at
the
gate
and
set
out
to
pay
their
long
deferred
visit
to
packard
why
was
it
that
they
did
not
think
to
read
that
pass
when
it
was
given
to
them
if
they
had
they
might
have
saved
themselves
from
something
disagreeable
that
afterward
happened
they
passed
a
very
pleasant
evening
at
packard
s
house
and
at
ten
they
took
leave
of
their
new
friends
and
started
for
the
academy
as
they
were
walking
briskly
along
the
road
that
ran
around
one
end
of
the
big
pond
they
heard
an
indistinct
murmur
of
voices
and
presently
saw
a
crowd
of
boys
who
were
walking
in
a
compact
body
pass
across
the
road
in
front
of
them
and
direct
their
course
toward
the
middle
of
the
pond
they
thought
at
first
that
it
was
a
skating
party
but
as
they
did
not
stop
to
put
on
their
skates
don
and
bert
became
interested
in
their
movements
and
halted
to
observe
them
just
then
a
voice
speaking
in
pleading
accents
came
to
their
ears
don
t
do
it
don
t
it
said
in
piteous
tones
i
wouldn
t
mind
it
so
much
if
i
could
stand
it
but
i
solemnly
assure
you
that
i
can
t
i
have
had
one
attack
of
pneumonia
this
winter
that
was
brought
on
by
exposure
and
ducking
me
in
this
icy
water
will
surely
give
me
no
it
won
t
replied
another
voice
that
don
knew
belonged
to
tom
fisher
this
is
a
custom
and
we
are
not
going
to
give
it
up
are
we
boys
not
much
answered
the
others
in
concert
our
fathers
were
hazed
when
they
went
to
this
school
they
in
turn
hazed
others
and
we
couldn
t
think
of
disgracing
them
by
refusing
to
follow
in
their
footsteps
continued
tom
everyone
of
the
fellows
you
see
around
among
the
been
hazed
in
one
way
or
another
and
are
you
a
new
york
any
better
than
we
are
hurry
him
on
and
pitch
him
in
said
clarence
duncan
in
his
deep
base
tones
wash
some
of
the
black
out
of
yes
in
with
him
piped
little
dick
henderson
well
boys
if
you
must
do
it
to
preserve
your
honor
let
me
take
my
clothes
off
first
said
the
pleading
voice
this
is
the
only
suit
i
have
in
the
world
and
if
i
get
it
wet
i
shall
freeze
to
death
for
i
have
no
fire
in
my
room
to
dry
it
then
go
to
bed
was
the
rough
rejoinder
why
what
in
the
world
are
those
fellows
going
to
do
said
bert
who
had
listened
in
great
amazement
to
this
conversation
every
word
of
which
came
distinctly
to
the
ears
of
himself
and
his
brother
i
am
afraid
they
are
going
to
do
something
to
have
you
just
found
it
out
exclaimed
don
who
now
discovered
that
the
boys
were
making
their
way
toward
a
hole
that
had
been
previously
cut
in
the
ice
a
party
of
students
led
by
fisher
and
duncan
are
going
to
haze
a
plebe
by
ducking
him
in
the
pond
now
i
shall
have
a
word
or
two
to
say
about
that
they
are
the
same
fellows
who
blocked
up
our
path
this
morning
and
wouldn
t
let
us
go
by
you
know
they
promised
to
settle
with
me
some
day
for
showing
so
much
independence
as
they
called
it
and
they
might
as
well
do
it
now
as
any
other
o
don
mind
what
you
are
about
cried
bert
i
will
i
ll
black
the
eyes
of
some
of
them
before
they
shall
stick
that
boy
through
the
ice
why
bert
what
would
father
say
to
me
if
he
should
hear
that
i
stood
by
and
witnessed
such
a
proceeding
without
lifting
a
hand
to
prevent
it
he
would
tell
me
i
wasn
t
worthy
of
the
name
i
no
one
who
knew
the
temper
of
the
academy
boys
and
the
tenacity
with
which
they
clung
to
the
customs
of
the
institution
to
which
they
belonged
would
have
thought
don
gordon
a
coward
if
he
had
taken
to
his
heels
and
made
the
best
of
his
way
to
his
room
he
knew
very
well
that
if
he
attempted
to
interfere
with
tom
and
his
crowd
he
stood
a
good
chance
of
being
ducked
himself
but
the
knowledge
of
this
fact
did
not
deter
him
from
promptly
carrying
out
the
plans
he
had
resolved
upon
it
would
have
been
bad
enough
he
told
himself
if
the
students
had
selected
as
a
victim
a
boy
who
had
an
extra
suit
of
clothes
a
change
of
linen
to
put
on
and
a
fire
to
warm
himself
by
after
his
cold
bath
but
to
pitch
upon
one
who
had
none
of
these
comforts
and
who
ran
the
risk
of
being
thrown
into
a
dangerous
illness
by
the
folly
of
his
tormentors
was
in
his
estimation
a
most
cowardly
act
and
one
that
could
not
be
too
severely
punished
bert
you
had
better
stay
here
where
you
will
be
safe
said
don
i
ll
not
do
it
was
the
prompt
reply
if
you
are
going
into
danger
i
am
going
in
don
knowing
that
it
would
be
of
no
use
to
argue
the
matter
ran
out
on
the
ice
and
when
he
came
up
with
the
crowd
his
coats
were
off
and
he
was
in
his
fisher
and
his
companions
stopped
when
they
heard
the
sound
of
his
approaching
footsteps
and
some
of
them
acted
as
if
they
wanted
to
run
away
but
when
they
discovered
that
don
and
bert
were
alone
they
waited
for
them
to
come
nearer
thinking
that
perhaps
they
were
a
couple
of
the
members
of
their
own
class
who
wanted
to
join
in
the
sport
when
they
saw
don
pull
off
his
overcoat
however
their
eyes
were
opened
here
comes
an
intruder
boys
exclaimed
one
of
the
students
and
judging
by
the
way
he
acts
he
is
getting
ready
for
a
let
him
get
ready
said
fisher
there
are
a
dozen
of
us
if
he
turns
out
to
be
a
plebe
we
ll
stick
him
in
too
the
more
the
merrier
you
know
who
comes
there
he
added
raising
his
voice
a
replied
don
throwing
his
coats
on
the
ice
yes
you
look
like
it
sneered
clarence
duncan
if
that
is
so
what
did
you
pull
your
duds
off
for
because
i
did
not
know
how
you
would
receive
my
overtures
and
i
thought
it
the
part
of
wisdom
to
be
prepared
for
any
emergency
answered
don
so
saying
he
walked
boldly
into
the
crowd
which
gave
way
right
and
left
as
he
advanced
and
took
his
stand
by
the
side
of
the
prisoner
who
was
firmly
held
by
two
of
the
largest
and
strongest
students
while
two
others
stood
close
behind
him
in
readiness
to
lend
their
assistance
in
case
he
made
any
attempt
at
escape
although
don
had
never
exchanged
a
word
with
the
boy
he
knew
him
at
once
for
they
belonged
to
the
same
company
it
was
the
new
student
whose
presence
if
we
are
to
believe
fisher
and
his
friends
was
a
disgrace
to
the
academy
and
everybody
belonging
to
it
he
wore
the
same
thin
clothes
in
which
he
had
shivered
as
he
walked
up
the
path
that
morning
and
the
keen
wind
that
swept
across
the
icy
surface
of
the
big
pond
must
have
chilled
him
to
the
very
marrow
he
had
no
muffler
about
his
face
nor
any
gloves
on
his
hands
which
he
held
clasped
one
within
the
other
as
if
they
were
very
cold
don
looked
at
him
and
then
at
the
comfortably
clad
boys
who
were
standing
around
and
his
blood
which
was
none
of
the
coolest
at
any
time
boiled
with
indignation
you
are
a
pack
of
contemptible
cowards
said
he
pulling
off
his
gloves
and
slamming
them
down
on
the
ice
why
bless
our
royal
heart
it
s
the
planter
exclaimed
tom
fisher
who
now
for
the
first
time
recognized
the
intruder
here
s
luck
boys
grab
hold
of
him
some
of
you
and
we
ll
wash
him
if
that
s
the
planter
this
must
be
his
brother
said
dick
henderson
why
so
it
is
said
fisher
after
he
had
taken
a
sharp
look
into
bert
s
face
here
s
more
luck
take
hold
of
him
too
boys
and
since
they
have
had
the
assurance
to
push
themselves
in
among
us
without
being
asked
we
will
give
them
the
post
of
honor
we
ll
duck
them
in
obedience
to
these
orders
three
or
four
pairs
of
hands
were
laid
upon
bert
s
arms
but
when
the
rest
of
the
crowd
moved
forward
to
lay
hold
of
don
duncan
stepped
up
and
stopped
them
stand
back
all
of
you
said
he
i
want
to
have
a
little
talk
with
this
fellow
before
he
is
put
into
that
gordon
you
insulted
me
this
morning
in
the
presence
of
my
friends
and
i
want
you
to
apologize
for
it
at
once
if
you
don
t
do
it
i
will
give
you
a
thrashing
right
here
on
this
ice
that
you
won
t
get
over
for
a
how
did
i
insult
you
asked
don
and
the
bully
was
somewhat
surprised
to
see
that
he
did
not
appear
to
be
at
all
alarmed
you
said
you
would
make
a
of
me
now
which
will
you
do
apologize
or
fight
well
if
it
s
all
the
same
to
you
i
ll
duncan
was
fairly
staggered
by
this
reply
remembering
the
exhibition
of
strength
he
had
witnessed
in
the
gymnasium
that
afternoon
he
had
no
desire
to
come
to
blows
with
the
stalwart
youth
who
stood
before
him
he
had
hoped
to
frighten
an
apology
from
don
and
when
he
found
that
he
could
not
do
it
he
wished
he
had
not
been
in
such
haste
to
make
overtures
of
battle
to
him
but
it
was
too
late
to
think
of
that
now
for
his
reputation
was
at
stake
besides
he
did
not
believe
that
his
friend
fisher
would
stand
by
and
see
him
worsted
you
need
have
no
fear
of
these
fellows
who
are
standing
around
said
duncan
who
wanted
to
put
off
the
critical
moment
as
long
as
he
could
they
will
not
on
if
they
do
they
will
take
the
consequences
said
don
confidently
i
think
myself
that
they
had
better
keep
their
these
bold
words
astonished
everybody
why
i
believe
he
thinks
he
can
whip
the
whole
crowd
said
henderson
who
was
one
of
the
four
who
were
holding
fast
to
bert
s
arms
bert
was
a
little
fellow
like
himself
and
consequently
dick
was
not
very
much
afraid
of
him
come
on
said
don
impatiently
i
am
getting
cold
standing
here
in
my
give
me
a
little
exercise
to
warm
me
up
remember
i
wasn
t
born
as
near
the
arctic
circle
as
you
fellows
were
and
for
that
reason
i
can
t
stand
the
cold
as
well
hurry
up
who
thinks
he
was
insulted
by
the
words
i
uttered
this
driven
almost
to
desperation
by
this
challenge
which
he
knew
was
addressed
to
himself
and
which
seemed
to
imply
that
his
prospective
antagonist
placed
a
very
low
estimate
upon
his
powers
duncan
pulled
off
both
his
coats
assumed
a
threatening
attitude
and
advanced
toward
don
who
extended
his
hand
in
the
most
friendly
manner
the
bully
believing
that
don
wanted
to
parley
with
him
took
the
proffered
hand
in
his
own
and
in
a
second
more
arose
in
the
air
as
if
an
exceedingly
strong
spring
had
suddenly
uncoiled
itself
under
his
feet
when
he
came
down
again
he
measured
his
full
length
on
the
ice
landing
in
such
dangerous
proximity
to
the
hole
that
had
been
cut
for
the
poor
student
s
benefit
that
his
uniform
cap
fell
into
it
everybody
was
struck
motionless
and
dumb
with
amazement
the
bully
was
so
bewildered
that
he
did
not
get
upon
his
feet
again
immediately
and
the
poor
student
forgot
to
shiver

iv

take
your
hands
off
those
boys
said
don
who
was
in
just
the
right
humor
to
make
a
scattering
among
fisher
s
crowd
of
friends
release
them
both
and
do
it
at

i
will

you

with
your

open
come
over
here
he
stepped
up
and
took
the
prisoner
by
the
arm
and
his
four
guards
surrendered
him
without
a
word
of
protest
the
magical
manner
in
which
don
had
floored
the
biggest
bully
in
school
before
whom
no
boy
in
bridgeport
had
ever
been
able
to
stand
for
a
minute
either
with
or
bare
fists
and
the
ease
with
which
he
had
done
it
astounded
them
they
had
never
seen
anything
like
it
before
and
there
was
something
very
mysterious
in
it
did
not
this
backwoodsman
have
other
equally
bewildering
tactics
at
his
command
which
he
could
bring
into
play
if
he
were
crowded
upon
probably
he
had
and
so
the
best
thing
they
could
do
was
to
let
him
alone
your
name
is
sam
arkwright
is
it
not
said
don
taking
one
of
the
boy
s
hands
in
both
his
own
warm
ones
i
thought
i
had
heard
you
answer
to
that

and
so
we
ll
stand
together
put
on

gloves
and
come
with
me
you
will
freeze
if
you
stay
here
any
longer
as
for
you
he
added
waving
his
hand
toward
the
students
to
show
that
he
included
them
all
in
the
remarks
he
was
about
to
make
you
are
a
pack
of
cowards
and
i
can
whip
the

man

you

here

i

but
i
give
in

when
they
all

he
led

away

my
room
is
and
any

notes
you
may
choose
to
shove

my
door
will
receive

tom
and
his
crowd
did
not
speak
they
had
not
yet
recovered
from
their
amazement
they
stood
gazing
after
the
rescued
boy
and
his
champion
until
they
disappeared
in
the
darkness
and
then
they
turned
and
looked
at
one
another
i
declare
duncan
exclaimed
tom
fisher
who
was
the
first
to
speak
you
ve
met
your
master
at
last
have
you
not
the
defeated
bully
growled
out
something
in
reply
but
his
friends
could
not
understand
what
it
was
like
every
boy
who
prides
himself
upon
his
strength
and
skill
he
did
not
like
to
acknowledge
that
he
had
been
beaten
did
he
hurt
you
asked
one
of
the
students
i
noticed
that
you
didn
t
get
up
right
how
in
the
name
of
all
that
s
wonderful
did
he
do
it
inquired
another
i
didn
t
see
him
clinch
or
strike
he
did
neither
replied
duncan
and
that
s
just
what
bangs
me
i
am
willing
to
swear
that
he
did
not
touch
me
anywhere
except
on
the
hand
and
he
took
hold
of
that
just
as
though
he
wanted
to
give
it
a
friendly
shake
it
s
a
trick
of
some
boss
one
i
will
give
him
my
next
quarter
s
spending
money
if
he
will
teach
it
to
humph
exclaimed
tom
fisher
you
needn
t
expect
to
him
to
do
that
he
doesn
t
look
to
me
to
be
such
a
fool
you
and
he
may
come
together
in
earnest
some
you
don
t
he
will
be
about
the
only
boy
you
haven
t
had
a
fight
with
since
you
have
been
a
student
at
this
then
you
will
probably
find
out
what
his
tricks
he
didn
t
hurt
me
at
all
continued
clarence
but
he
could
if
he
had
been
so
disposed
if
he
had
used
a
little
more
exertion
he
could
have
thrown
me
into
that
and
if
i
had
happened
to
come
up
under
the
exclaimed
clarence
shivering
all
over
as
he
looked
down
into
the
dark
water
is
there
no
way
in
which
we
can
get
even
with
him
asked
fisher
there
replied
clarence
angrily
do
you
suppose
that
i
am
going
to
submit
tamely
to
an
insult
like
that
we
ll
make
a
way
to
get
even
with
him
things
have
come
to
a
pretty
pass
if
a
plebe
is
going
to
be
allowed
to
come
here
and
run
this
school
to
suit
the
mere
reference
to
such
an
thing
was
enough
to
raise
the
ire
of
tom
fisher
and
all
his
companions
who
with
one
voice
declared
that
the
planter
having
presumed
to
lay
violent
hands
on
an
boy
and
to
set
at
defiance
one
of
the
customs
of
the
academy
must
be
made
to
suffer
the
consequences
they
held
a
long
and
earnest
consultation
there
on
the
ice
and
fisher
and
duncan
who
were
fruitful
in
expedients
soon
hit
upon
a
plan
which
promised
if
skillfully
managed
to
bring
sam
arkwright
s
champion
into
serious
trouble
it
was
a
most
dangerous
plan
because
it
was
to
be
carried
out
under
the
guise
of
friendship
that
s
the
only
way
to
do
it
fellows
you
may
depend
upon
it
said
duncan
after
their
scheme
had
been
thoroughly
discussed
we
must
bring
him
into
trouble
with
the
faculty
and
let
them
do
the
hazing
for
we
couldn
t
do
it
if
we
wanted
to
i
was
nothing
but
a
child
in
his
grasp
and
to
tell
the
honest
truth
i
have
no
desire
to
face
him
i
hope
we
shall
succeed
said
fisher
but
if
the
planter
turns
out
to
be
one
of
those
good
little
boys
who
never
do
anything
wrong
then
what
if
tom
had
only
known
it
he
need
not
have
bothered
his
head
on
this
point
unfortunately
for
don
something
happened
that
very
night
which
made
it
comparatively
easy
for
the
conspirators
to
carry
out
the
plans
they
had
formed
regarding
him
meanwhile
don
and
bert
were
walking
briskly
toward
the
academy
in
company
with
the
rescued
boy
who
was
somewhat
protected
from
the
keen
wind
by
bert
s
muffler
which
the
latter
had
wrapped
about
his
neck
and
by
don
s
gloves
which
he
wore
upon
his
hands
he
was
lost
in
admiration
of
his
new
friend
s
prowess
and
complimented
him
in
the
best
language
he
could
command
are
you
an
irishman
sir
sam
asked
at
length
look
here
answered
don
my
name
is
s
no
sir
about
it
no
i
am
not
an
irishman
i
am
an
american
i
am
proud
to
say
but
i
understand
the
irish
hand
and
foot
well
enough
to
give
it
to
such
fellows
as
that
clarence
duncan
i
can
throw
a
man
weighing
two
hundred
pounds
in
that
way
if
he
will
let
me
take
hold
of
his
it
was
well
done
said
sam
i
never
saw
it
done
i
learned
it
of
one
of
my
father
s
hired
discharged
union
soldier
who
came
to
our
plantation
penniless
and
hungry
and
asked
for
work
said
don
i
always
make
it
a
point
to
pick
up
any
little
thing
of
that
kind
that
happens
to
fall
in
my
way
it
may
come
handy
some
day
you
perhaps
you
will
now
understand
how
don
had
managed
to
throw
the
bully
of
the
school
so
easily
but
if
you
do
not
we
can
only
say
that
it
can
not
be
described
on
paper
so
that
you
can
gain
even
a
faint
idea
of
it
if
you
want
to
know
just
how
it
was
done
the
easiest
way
to
learn
is
to
ask
some
fresher
he
is
from
the
old
sod
the
give
you
a
practical
illustration
of
the
hand
and
simply
give
him
your
hand
and
if
his
feelings
toward
you
are
friendly
he
will
send
you
flying
through
the
air
without
hurting
you
in
the
least
but
if
he
is
not
friendly
we
would
not
advise
you
to
go
to
him
for
information
for
he
can
turn
you
heels
up
in
an
instant
and
land
you
on
your
head
with
force
enough
to
knock
all
your
brains
into
your
boots
don
had
become
so
expert
in
this
novel
way
of
wrestling
and
so
prone
to
put
it
into
practice
at
every
opportunity
that
none
of
the
boys
about
rochdale
could
be
induced
to
shake
hands
with
him
how
did
you
ever
happen
to
find
your
way
to
this
school
inquired
don
after
sam
had
exhausted
his
vocabulary
in
praising
his
new
friend
s
skill
as
a
wrestler
were
you
really
a
new
york
yes
i
was
answered
sam
hesitatingly
it
is
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
said
bert
who
thought
from
the
way
sam
spoke
that
he
did
not
like
to
confess
that
he
had
once
occupied
so
lowly
a
position
in
the
world
of
course
not
don
hastened
to
add
any
honest
work
is
honorable
your
presence
here
proves
that
you
didn
t
want
to
remain
a
all
your
no
i
didn
t
i
was
ambitious
to
be
something
better
said
sam
who
then
went
on
to
give
don
and
his
brother
a
short
history
of
his
life
he
said
that
his
father
who
followed
the
sea
for
a
livelihood
had
gone
down
with
his
vessel
during
a
terrific
storm
off
cape
hatteras
that
his
mother
had
survived
him
but
a
few
months
and
that
after
her
death
a
grasping
landlord
had
seized
all
the
household
furniture
as
security
for
the
rent
that
was
due
and
unpaid
turning
him
sam
into
the
streets
to
shift
for
himself
he
spent
the
days
in
roaming
about
the
city
looking
in
vain
for
work
and
his
nights
in
a
to
which
he
had
been
invited
by
a
friendly
who
found
free
lodgings
there
every
night
and
who
seeing
sam
s
forlorn
condition
gave
him
a
plate
of
soup
to
eat
and
furnished
him
with
a
plank
to
sleep
on
finding
that
work
was
not
to
be
had
sam
at
last
ran
in
debt
for
a
s
kit
which
he
procured
from
one
of
the
fraternity
who
had
saved
money
enough
to
open
a
corner
peanut
stand
and
after
a
score
or
more
of
battles
with
boys
whose
claims
he
unwittingly
jumped
he
succeeded
in
establishing
himself
in
front
of
a
popular
hotel
in
the
city
where
he
was
to
be
found
early
and
late
it
was
there
he
met
the
superintendent
of
the
bridgeport
military
academy
who
patronized
him
twice
every
day
never
failing
to
give
him
a
quarter
for
each
shine
or
to
spend
a
few
minutes
in
conversation
with
him
after
the
boy
s
work
was
completed
from
the
day
he
was
six
years
old
up
to
the
time
his
father
was
lost
at
sea
sam
attended
the
district
school
regularly
and
as
he
was
a
very
faithful
student
and
tried
hard
to
learn
he
knew
more
about
books
than
boys
of
his
age
generally
do
he
felt
that
he
was
out
of
place
among
the
ragged
ignorant
little
gamins
with
whom
he
was
daily
and
hourly
thrown
in
contact
and
they
realizing
that
he
was
not
one
of
them
and
that
he
believed
himself
to
be
fitted
for
something
better
than
the
life
of
a
tormented
him
in
every
conceivable
way
he
was
so
often
called
upon
to
protect
his
brush
and
his
box
of
blacking
from
the
young
rowdies
who
would
have
despoiled
him
of
them
that
he
became
an
adept
at
fighting
and
it
is
probable
that
he
would
have
opened
the
eyes
of
tom
fisher
and
his
crowd
had
they
not
pounced
upon
him
while
he
was
asleep
and
overpowered
him
before
he
could
raise
a
hand
to
defend
himself
i
am
sure
i
don
t
know
what
it
was
that
made
the
professor
take
a
liking
to
me
said
sam
in
conclusion
but
it
was
something
and
when
he
asked
me
if
i
wouldn
t
like
to
quit
that
miserable
business
and
go
to
school
and
learn
to
be
a
civil
or
a
mining
engineer
i
tell
you
it
almost
took
my
breath
away
i
jumped
at
the
chance
i
gave
my
kit
to
a
boy
who
was
too
poor
to
buy
one
and
came
out
here
and
i
am
very
sorry
for
it
the
fellows
don
t
want
me
here
and
they
didn
t
want
me
in
new
york
either
i
hope
i
shall
some
day
find
a
place
where
i
shall
not
be
in
everybody
s
don
t
get
said
don
taking
one
of
his
hands
out
of
his
pocket
long
enough
to
give
sam
an
encouraging
slap
on
the
back
of
course
your
tuition
is
free
yes
everything
is
furnished
me
if
it
wasn
t
i
couldn
t
stay
here
for
i
have
no
money
to
speak
of
the
boys
in
new
york
badgered
me
so
and
ran
such
heavy
opposition
to
me
that
i
couldn
t
earn
enough
to
buy
a
warm
suit
of
you
will
have
an
abundance
of
them
in
a
day
or
two
said
don
for
our
uniforms
will
be
along
by
that
time
you
couldn
t
get
an
education
on
better
terms
than
the
professor
offers
it
to
you
could
you
and
so
long
as
he
is
willing
that
you
should
stay
here
you
can
well
afford
to
let
the
fellows
grumble
to
their
hearts
content
show
the
professor
that
you
appreciate
his
kindness
by
doing
your
duty
like
a
man
and
look
to
me
for
help
whenever
you
get
into
trouble
now
the
next
thing
is
something
else
added
don
as
he
and
his
companions
came
to
a
halt
in
front
of
the
high
which
inclosed
the
academy
grounds
where
s
your
room
sam
i
haven
t
any
yet
i
sleep
in
the
attic
the
rooms
on
the
floor
occupied
by
our
class
are
all
taken
except
one
that
has
been
used
as
a
and
as
soon
as
it
is
cleared
out
i
am
to
have
it
for
my
well
do
you
want
the
teachers
to
know
anything
about
this
night
s
work
of
course
not
returned
sam
who
had
all
a
decent
boy
s
horror
of
because
if
you
do
continued
don
you
can
walk
up
to
one
of
the
guards
let
him
report
you
for
being
outside
the
grounds
without
a
pass
and
when
you
are
hauled
over
the
coals
for
it
you
can
say
that
you
were
taken
out
against
your
but
i
don
t
want
to
say
that
answered
sam
quickly
it
would
bring
tom
and
the
rest
into
trouble
i
have
nothing
against
them
and
i
should
be
glad
to
be
friends
with
them
if
they
would
only
let
you
ll
do
to
tie
to
said
don
approvingly
bert
and
i
have
a
pass
that
will
see
us
through
all
right
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
do
you
think
you
can
make
your
way
to
the
attic
without
being
seen
by
any
of
the
sentries
or
floor
guards
tom
and
his
crowd
brought
me
out
without
attracting
the
attention
of
any
of
them
and
i
don
t
see
why
i
can
t
get
back
without
being
caught
at
any
rate
i
shall
try
my
best
i
hope
that
neither
of
you
will
ever
stand
in
need
of
such
aid
as
you
have
rendered
me
but
if
you
do
you
may
count
on
me
every
so
saying
sam
moved
away
in
one
direction
closely
examining
all
the
pickets
on
the
fence
as
he
went
and
don
and
bert
walked
off
in
the
other
when
the
latter
arrived
within
sight
of
the
main
gate
they
were
somewhat
surprised
to
see
that
it
was
closed
the
sound
of
their
footsteps
on
the
frosty
snow
quickly
attracted
the
attention
of
the
alert
sentry
who
came
out
of
his
box
and
demanded
to
know
who
they
were
and
what
they
were
doing
there
at
that
time
of
night
we
belong
to
this
academy
replied
don
and
have
a
pass
from
the
corporal
of
the
guard
no
yelled
the
sentry
and
the
call
was
caught
up
and
repeated
by
another
sentinel
who
stood
at
the
farther
end
of
the
academy
and
finally
reached
the
ears
of
the
corporal
who
was
toasting
his
shins
in
front
of
a
warm
fire
in
the
what
do
you
want
the
corporal
for
here
s
our
pass
said
don
and
taking
the
paper
in
question
from
his
pocket
he
thrust
it
between
the
bars
of
the
gate
still
the
sentry
made
no
reply
nor
did
he
seem
to
know
that
don
had
spoken
to
him
he
brought
his
musket
to
a
support
and
paced
back
and
forth
on
the
other
side
of
the
gate
with
slow
and
dignified
steps
don
muttered
something
under
his
breath
and
bert
believing
that
he
was
grumbling
at
the
sentry
for
being
so
uncivil
laid
his
hand
on
his
brother
s
arm
and
said
in
a
low
don
t
be
angry
with
him
perhaps
he
is
not
allowed
to
talk
while
he
is
on
don
said
nothing
he
began
to
believe
that
he
and
bert
had
unwittingly
got
themselves
into
trouble
again
and
when
the
corporal
came
up
he
found
that
he
had
not
been
mistaken
what
s
the
matter
here
demanded
the
officer
there
are
a
couple
of
plebes
out
there
who
want
to
come
in
was
the
sentry
s
reply
who
are
you
said
the
corporal
peering
through
the
pickets
at
the
two
brothers
don
gave
him
their
names
whereupon
the
corporal
took
a
key
down
from
a
nail
in
the
sentry
s
box
and
after
unlocking
the
gate
told
the
boys
to
come
in
they
obeyed
and
the
officer
having
returned
the
key
to
its
place
drew
a
from
his
pocket
and
wrote
something
in
it
that
s
all
right
said
he
as
he
closed
the
book
and
put
it
back
in
his
pocket
have
we
done
anything
wrong
inquired
bert
in
anxious
tones
you
will
find
that
out
was
the
corporal
s
very
unsatisfactory
answer
why
can
t
you
give
a
civil
reply
to
a
civil
question
demanded
don
impatiently
we
had
liberty
to
go
outside
the
grounds
for
the
evening
and
here
s
the
pass
that
says
i
don
t
want
to
see
it
said
the
corporal
as
he
buttoned
his
overcoat
and
drew
the
cape
over
his
head
i
know
just
how
it
reads
come
where
are
you
going
to
take
us
asked
bert
while
visions
of
the
gloomy
danced
before
his
eyes
to
the
officer
of
the
day
of
and
what
will
he
do
with
us
that
s
for
him
to
tell
come
on
it
s
too
cold
to
stand
here
any
don
and
bert
fell
in
behind
the
corporal
who
led
the
way
to
the
and
ushered
them
into
a
little
office
where
the
officer
of
the
stern
old
prussian
soldier
who
wore
a
medal
he
had
won
by
his
gallantry
on
the
field
of
battle
while
serving
under
prince
frederick
reading
a
newspaper
when
the
officer
entered
with
his
prisoners
he
laid
the
paper
down
and
took
off
his
spectacles
vel
gorporal
said
he
in
a
pompous
tone
vat
ish
the
drouble
mit
dem
gadets
they
have
overstayed
their
time
sir
said
the
corporal
vot
for
you
do
dot
demanded
the
officer
of
the
day
turning
fiercely
upon
the
culprits
vot
for
you
not
come
in
ha
we
were
not
aware
that
we
had
overstayed
our
time
sir
answered
don
if
we
had
known
that
we
were
expected
to
return
at
a
certain
hour
we
should
have
been
here
we
had
a
pass
for
the
evening
and
there
it
dot
s
no
good
after
daps
said
the
officer
of
the
day
turning
away
his
head
and
waving
his
hand
in
the
air
to
indicate
that
he
did
not
care
to
look
at
the
paper
which
don
presented
for
his
inspection
i
assure
you
sir
that
it
was
a
mistake
on
our
part
said
bert
but
the
officer
of
the
day
declared
in
his
broken
english
and
with
many
gesticulations
that
such
things
as
mistakes
were
not
recognized
in
that
don
and
his
brother
had
violated
the
regulations
and
might
make
up
their
minds
to
be
punished
accordingly
then
he
ordered
them
to
their
quarters
while
the
corporal
went
back
to
his
seat
by
the
stove
he
didn
t
say
that
we
were
in
arrest
did
he
said
don
as
he
and
bert
ascended
the
stairs
at
the
top
of
which
they
met
the
sentry
who
had
charge
of
that
floor
standing
with
his
in
his
hand
your
names
please
said
he
pleasantly
the
corporal
of
the
guard
has
them
and
so
has
the
officer
of
the
day
answered
don
and
i
must
have
them
too
returned
the
sentry
holding
his
pencil
poised
in
the
air
don
gave
the
required
information
in
rather
a
sullen
tone
and
closed
the
door
of
his
dormitory
behind
him
with
no
gentle
hand
as
soon
as
bert
had
struck
a
light
he
drew
the
pass
from
his
pocket
and
read
as
follows
guards
and
patrols
will
pass
privates
donald
and
hubert
gordon
until
nine
o
clock
this
then
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
saw
that
it
lacked
only
a
quarter
of
eleven
allowing
fifteen
minutes
for
their
interviews
with
the
corporal
and
the
officer
of
the
day
they
had
overstayed
their
time
just
an
hour
bert
was
very
penitent
but
don
was
inclined
to
be
rebellious
chapter
don
and
bert
have
visitors
i
wonder
if
a
fellow
can
make
a
move
in
any
direction
without
breaking
some
of
the
numerous
rules
of
this
school
and
being
reported
for
it
said
don
throwing
his
overcoat
and
cap
spitefully
down
upon
the
bed
i
declare
just
then
the
door
opened
and
the
sentry
thrust
his
head
into
the
room
put
out
that
light
plebe
said
he
two
reports
in
one
night
make
a
tolerably
bad
showing
the
first
thing
you
catch
hold
of
that
and
jerk
it
out
of
the
wall
exclaimed
don
as
bert
hastened
to
obey
the
sentry
s
order
that
makes
twice
it
has
got
us
into
oh
i
wouldn
t
do
that
said
the
sentry
with
a
laugh
you
had
better
read
the
rules
and
regulations
until
you
have
them
firmly
fixed
in
your
mind
and
then
if
you
see
fit
to
obey
them
to
the
very
letter
you
will
have
plain
don
undressed
in
the
dark
and
tumbled
into
bed
telling
himself
the
while
that
he
didn
t
care
a
snap
of
his
finger
for
the
rules
and
regulations
he
had
not
purposely
violated
any
of
them
and
yet
he
had
been
severely
reprimanded
and
was
yet
to
be
punished
as
though
he
had
been
willfully
disobedient
when
the
leopard
can
change
his
spots
and
the
ethiopian
his
skin
i
shall
believe
that
there
is
some
hope
for
me
said
don
to
himself
as
he
arranged
his
pillow
and
prepared
to
go
to
sleep
but
there
doesn
t
seem
to
be
much
now
for
the
harder
i
try
to
be
good
the
more
rows
i
get
into
i
would
give
something
to
know
how
tom
fisher
and
his
crowd
came
out
and
whether
or
not
sam
succeeded
in
getting
back
to
his
attic
without
being
seen
by
the
bert
arose
the
next
morning
after
an
almost
sleepless
night
full
of
apprehension
and
trembling
for
fear
of
the
punishment
that
was
to
be
visited
upon
him
while
don
s
face
wore
a
defiant
expression
he
had
slept
the
sleep
of
the
healthy
and
awoke
refreshed
and
fully
prepared
to
meet
anything
that
might
be
in
store
for
him
greatly
to
his
surprise
and
bert
s
nothing
was
said
to
them
regarding
what
had
taken
place
the
night
before
they
found
opportunity
to
exchange
a
few
words
with
sam
arkwright
who
gleefully
informed
them
that
everything
was
all
right
and
that
no
one
was
the
wiser
for
the
assault
that
had
been
made
upon
him
by
the
boys
and
caught
a
momentary
glimpse
of
fisher
and
duncan
both
of
whom
smiled
and
saluted
in
the
most
courteous
manner
don
did
not
know
what
this
meant
but
it
was
not
long
before
he
found
out
that
afternoon
all
the
members
of
the
fourth
class
were
ordered
to
the
where
they
found
a
the
captain
of
their
company
and
one
of
the
teachers
who
served
out
to
them
their
new
uniforms
which
they
were
told
to
put
on
at
once
when
ranks
were
broken
don
and
bert
hastened
to
their
dormitory
and
had
just
completed
the
work
of
exchanging
their
citizen
s
clothes
for
their
natty
suits
of
cadet
gray
when
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
bert
s
heart
seemed
to
stop
beating
that
must
be
the
orderly
said
he
in
an
excited
if
it
is
we
shall
soon
know
what
is
going
to
become
of
well
we
might
as
well
know
one
time
as
another
said
don
doggedly
i
hope
it
is
the
orderly
for
i
have
been
kept
in
suspense
long
bert
opened
the
door
when
who
should
appear
on
the
threshold
but
tom
fisher
and
clarence
duncan
the
former
extended
his
hand
to
bert
who
took
it
after
a
little
hesitation
while
clarence
entered
the
room
and
greeted
don
in
the
same
friendly
way
gordon
said
clarence
as
don
s
sinewy
fingers
closed
about
his
own
you
re
a
brick
we
came
here
to
tell
you
and
your
brother
that
we
and
the
rest
of
the
fellows
are
sorry
for
what
happened
last
night
and
that
we
want
to
be
friends
with
nothing
would
suit
me
better
answered
don
we
have
had
time
to
consider
the
matter
said
fisher
seating
himself
on
bert
s
bed
and
depositing
his
cap
on
the
table
and
we
are
all
very
glad
that
you
didn
t
let
us
duck
that
plebe
it
would
have
been
a
mean
piece
of
business
to
haze
him
in
that
way
seeing
that
he
didn
t
have
a
suit
of
dry
clothes
to
put
or
a
fire
to
warm
himself
by
chimed
in
bert
with
some
indignation
in
his
tones
why
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
it
would
have
been
the
death
of
it
was
cold
wasn
t
it
said
clarence
well
we
didn
t
haze
him
and
as
tom
says
we
are
all
glad
of
it
but
i
say
you
make
soldiers
you
two
did
you
get
in
last
night
all
right
we
got
in
twice
answered
don
ruefully
we
got
inside
the
grounds
and
we
got
into
how
was
that
didn
t
you
have
a
pass
yes
but
it
was
only
good
until
nine
and
we
stayed
out
until
oh
ah
well
that
s
nothing
when
you
get
used
to
it
is
it
fisher
said
clarence
nothing
at
all
replied
tom
it
has
been
a
very
common
thing
with
me
and
now
i
never
think
of
asking
for
a
pass
i
go
when
i
please
and
come
back
when
i
feel
like
what
do
you
suppose
they
will
do
with
us
asked
bert
who
was
anxious
to
have
that
point
settled
as
soon
as
possible
let
me
see
said
clarence
thoughtfully
who
was
officer
of
the
day
yesterday
i
don
t
know
his
name
answered
don
but
he
was
the
same
one
who
instructs
our
class
in
mathematics
an
old
gentleman
with
gold
spectacles
and
a
medal
of
some
kind
on
his
oh
that
was
dutchy
said
fisher
in
a
tone
of
contempt
he
s
our
also
well
he
will
make
the
case
against
you
as
black
as
he
can
and
if
he
were
the
one
to
say
how
you
should
be
punished
i
tell
you
you
would
have
a
lively
time
of
it
for
he
is
a
regular
martinet
the
president
is
a
very
strict
disciplinarian
but
he
hasn
t
yet
forgotten
that
he
was
once
a
boy
himself
and
he
will
probably
be
easy
with
but
what
will
he
do
insisted
bert
that
s
what
don
and
i
want
to
know
and
if
he
is
going
to
punish
us
at
all
why
doesn
t
he
say
so
because
the
proper
time
has
not
yet
arrived
wait
until
comes
off
and
then
you
will
find
out
all
about
it
for
it
will
be
published
in
general
before
the
whole
school
cried
bert
of
course
answered
clarence
bert
grew
very
red
in
the
face
and
looked
at
don
who
in
turn
stared
hard
at
bert
it
is
nothing
to
worry
over
said
fisher
some
of
the
best
fellows
in
school
have
been
gated
and
made
to
walk
extras
on
saturday
afternoons
with
packed
knapsacks
and
that
is
all
the
punishment
you
will
what
do
you
mean
by
gated
asked
don
what
is
a
packed
knapsack
inquired
bert
why
when
a
fellow
is
gated
he
is
confined
inside
the
grounds
and
not
allowed
to
go
out
under
any
circumstances
replied
clarence
but
he
can
go
out
all
the
same
if
he
feels
like
it
said
fisher
with
a
laugh
i
never
knew
a
fellow
to
stay
inside
the
grounds
simply
because
he
was
gated
unless
he
was
one
of
those
milk
and
water
boys
who
hadn
t
spirit
enough
to
say
that
his
soul
was
his
how
can
he
get
out
asked
don
he
can
run
the
guards
clarence
and
i
have
done
it
many
a
were
you
never
caught
at
it
inquired
bert
once
or
twice
but
that
was
owing
to
our
own
carelessness
it
is
an
easy
thing
to
do
when
the
right
kind
of
fellows
are
on
duty
and
really
exciting
when
the
posts
are
held
by
such
boys
as
blake
and
walker
and
others
of
that
sort
they
re
a
mean
set
they
are
always
on
the
watch
for
a
chance
to
report
somebody
because
they
believe
that
that
is
the
way
to
gain
the
of
the
and
a
packed
knapsack
continued
clarence
is
one
with
something
heavy
in
it
such
as
bricks
or
when
you
are
called
upon
to
walk
an
extra
you
have
to
pace
up
and
down
your
beat
for
four
hours
with
that
knapsack
on
your
back
and
a
musket
on
your
that
can
t
be
very
pleasant
observed
don
well
i
am
free
to
confess
that
it
isn
t
returned
clarence
and
it
is
all
owing
to
the
way
the
thing
is
managed
if
they
would
let
us
perform
the
extra
duty
while
the
rest
of
the
boys
were
drilling
or
while
the
class
in
geometry
was
reciting
i
should
not
mind
it
in
the
least
but
you
see
they
won
t
do
that
we
have
to
work
hard
all
the
week
and
walk
our
extras
on
saturday
afternoons
during
the
hours
that
are
given
to
the
good
little
boys
for
cricket
fishing
and
recreations
of
that
but
overstaying
our
time
was
not
the
only
offence
of
which
we
were
guilty
last
night
said
don
after
a
moment
s
pause
when
we
reached
our
room
we
struck
a
light
and
i
suppose
we
shall
be
reported
for
of
course
you
will
said
fisher
you
had
no
business
to
have
a
light
in
your
room
after
but
we
didn
t
think
said
bert
and
besides
we
wanted
to
read
our
pass
so
that
we
might
know
just
what
we
had
done
that
was
no
odds
exclaimed
clarence
no
excuse
will
be
accepted
you
will
probably
be
gated
for
a
but
you
need
not
submit
to
the
restriction
of
your
liberty
unless
you
feel
like
it
chimed
in
fisher
do
as
all
the
best
fellows
in
school
the
guard
and
have
a
good
time
in
spite
of
the
oh
we
ll
never
do
that
said
bert
quickly
will
we
don
that
would
only
make
a
bad
matter
don
looked
down
at
the
floor
but
said
nothing
he
always
grew
restive
under
restraint
and
having
been
allowed
when
at
home
to
go
and
come
as
he
pleased
he
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
being
confined
within
bounds
if
fisher
and
duncan
had
known
what
he
was
thinking
about
just
then
they
would
have
said
that
the
success
of
the
plans
they
had
formed
the
night
before
was
a
foregone
conclusion
well
gordon
said
tom
at
length
everything
is
all
square
between
us
i
certainly
it
is
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
answered
don
and
i
know
that
arkwright
does
not
bear
you
any
for
he
said
so
you
fellows
ought
to
make
matters
straight
with
him
for
he
is
true
blue
he
took
a
good
deal
of
pains
to
work
his
way
back
to
the
attic
without
being
seen
for
he
didn
t
want
the
teachers
to
know
what
you
had
we
ll
see
him
and
have
a
talk
with
him
said
tom
as
he
arose
from
the
bed
and
picked
up
his
cap
perhaps
we
had
better
go
clarence
you
know
what
will
happen
to
us
if
we
fail
in
our
logic
what
do
you
think
of
the
prospect
he
added
as
soon
as
he
and
his
crony
had
reached
their
own
dormitory
and
closed
the
door
behind
them
will
he
bite
i
am
sure
of
it
was
duncan
s
confident
reply
he
is
a
fellow
who
doesn
t
like
to
be
held
with
too
tight
a
can
see
that
plainly
enough
but
bert
is
a
different
sort
of
what
do
we
care
for
bert
exclaimed
tom
don
is
the
one
we
are
i
know
that
and
i
know
too
that
we
could
get
him
very
easily
if
his
brother
were
out
of
the
way
these
little
spooneys
sometimes
exert
a
good
deal
of
influence
over
their
big
brothers
and
if
he
sets
his
face
against
us
and
our
plans
our
cake
will
be
turned
into
dough
in
short
we
must
see
to
it
that
don
doesn
t
listen
to
him
said
tom
we
have
done
all
we
can
do
we
have
given
him
an
idea
and
now
we
will
let
him
chew
on
it
for
a
while
we
mustn
t
appear
to
be
too
eager
you
know
for
if
we
give
him
the
least
reason
to
suspect
that
we
are
putting
up
a
job
on
him
it
is
my
opinion
that
he
will
prove
an
unpleasant
fellow
to
have
as
fisher
said
this
he
picked
up
his
logic
in
which
both
he
and
duncan
had
failed
miserably
that
day
and
read
in
a
listless
indifferent
what
is
true
with
limitations
is
frequently
assumed
to
be
true
absolutely
deleterious
drugs
are
always
to
be
rejected
opium
is
a
deleterious
drug
therefore
opium
is
always
to
be
what
s
wrong
with
that
reasoning
clarence
i
don
t
know
and
i
don
t
care
answered
the
latter
snatching
the
book
from
his
friend
s
hand
and
slamming
it
down
upon
the
table
let
it
go
until
this
evening
and
then
we
will
study
it
together
let
s
have
a
game
of
checkers
now
and
see
if
you
can
beat
me
as
badly
as
you
did
the
last
time
we
i
don
t
much
like
those
fellows
don
said
bert
when
fisher
and
duncan
had
taken
their
leave
i
can
t
see
what
there
is
wrong
about
them
replied
don
who
knew
in
a
moment
what
his
brother
meant
i
am
sure
they
acted
very
honorably
in
coming
here
to
make
things
right
with
i
have
nothing
to
say
against
that
bert
hastened
to
answer
but
i
don
t
like
to
hear
them
talk
so
glibly
about
disobeying
the
i
don
t
know
that
that
is
any
business
of
yours
or
mine
either
said
don
rather
impatiently
if
they
are
willing
to
take
the
risk
and
abide
the
consequences
if
they
are
detected
that
is
their
own
affair
needn
t
do
i
exclaimed
bert
in
great
amazement
you
maybe
sure
that
i
have
no
intention
of
doing
anything
of
the
kind
and
i
hope
you
haven
t
you
need
not
waste
any
valuable
time
in
worrying
about
me
i
am
able
to
look
out
for
myself
but
i
ll
tell
you
what
s
a
fact
bert
i
don
t
think
as
much
of
this
military
business
as
i
did
a
few
weeks
ago
if
i
were
only
back
home
with
my
pony
dogs
and
guns
i
tell
you
i
would
stay
there
i
feel
more
like
going
out
in
the
woods
and
knocking
over
a
wild
turkey
than
i
do
like
sitting
here
in
this
gloomy
room
preparing
for
s
don
opened
one
of
the
books
that
lay
upon
the
table
but
the
page
on
which
he
fastened
his
eyes
might
have
been
blank
for
all
he
saw
there
his
mind
was
not
upon
the
work
that
demanded
his
attention
he
was
thinking
over
his
recent
interview
with
fisher
and
duncan
i
wonder
if
they
pass
their
evenings
at
cony
ryan
s
when
they
run
the
guards
said
don
to
himself
i
wonder
too
if
cony
s
hotel
or
whatever
he
calls
it
was
in
existence
when
my
father
attended
this
school
and
if
he
went
there
to
eat
pancakes
if
he
did
i
don
t
see
how
he
can
find
any
fault
with
me
if
i
go
there
tom
and
clarence
don
t
seem
to
be
such
a
bad
lot
and
it
is
nothing
more
than
fair
that
i
should
meet
their
advances
half
when
the
hour
for
recreation
came
don
did
something
he
had
never
done
before
in
his
life
watching
his
opportunity
he
slipped
away
from
bert
and
set
out
to
hunt
up
fisher
and
duncan
he
did
not
have
much
trouble
in
finding
them
for
they
also
were
looking
for
him
after
returning
his
salute
they
slipped
their
arms
through
his
and
led
him
toward
the
gymnasium
you
are
a
stranger
here
said
clarence
and
as
we
know
you
must
be
lonely
we
will
introduce
you
to
the
boys
in
our
set
if
you
would
like
to
know
you
will
find
them
all
fellows
added
tom
you
see
there
is
a
little
crowd
of
us
who
run
together
and
somehow
we
manage
to
have
good
times
there
are
some
boys
here
however
with
whom
we
never
have
anything
to
do
we
will
point
them
out
to
you
as
fast
as
we
can
so
that
you
can
steer
clear
of
they
are
lads
said
clarence
and
won
t
associate
with
any
but
the
members
of
their
own
class
some
of
them
are
preparing
for
west
point
they
pride
themselves
on
being
soldiers
all
over
and
if
they
can
t
prove
their
soldierly
qualities
in
any
other
way
they
will
report
where
s
your
brother
asked
tom
suddenly
don
replied
that
he
didn
t
know
where
he
was
i
rather
fancied
that
he
didn
t
exactly
like
what
we
said
about
running
the
guard
a
while
ago
continued
tom
did
he
no
he
didn
t
he
wouldn
t
think
of
doing
such
a
well
then
he
can
make
up
his
mind
to
be
gated
on
an
average
of
once
a
month
as
long
as
he
stays
here
for
no
matter
how
hard
he
tries
he
can
t
help
breaking
some
of
the
rules
if
he
has
a
mind
to
submit
to
that
s
his
business
and
not
i
haven
t
done
it
since
i
have
been
here
said
fisher
emphatically
and
what
s
more
i
won
where
do
you
go
when
you
run
the
guard
anywhere
we
please
sometimes
we
spend
an
hour
or
two
in
skating
or
and
when
we
get
tired
of
that
we
go
down
to
cony
ryan
s
after
pancakes
and
i
don
t
for
the
life
of
me
see
how
you
can
get
out
said
don
there
are
sentries
all
around
the
it
does
require
some
skill
and
cunning
that
s
a
fact
especially
when
fellows
who
don
t
like
you
happen
to
be
on
duty
but
if
the
members
of
your
own
set
are
on
post
it
is
easy
enough
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
give
them
notice
of
your
coming
and
they
will
turn
their
backs
until
you
can
creep
by
go
with
us
and
we
will
show
you
how
it
is
done
said
fisher
that
s
so
exclaimed
clarence
as
if
the
idea
had
just
been
suggested
to
him
it
will
be
a
good
time
another
like
it
may
not
occur
for
a
month
will
you
do
it
gordon
i
dare
it
is
a
common
saying
in
my
country
that
a
man
who
will
take
a
dare
will
steal
sheep
said
don
of
course
he
will
answered
clarence
i
knew
we
had
not
been
mistaken
in
we
haven
t
had
any
of
cony
s
pies
and
pancakes
this
winter
continued
tom
and
we
are
getting
hungry
for
some
i
have
taken
particular
pains
to
find
out
who
the
sentries
are
and
i
know
that
some
of
them
are
good
men
and
true
there
are
some
of
our
boys
now
come
on
gordon
and
we
will
make
you
acquainted
with
they
had
by
this
time
entered
the
gymnasium
large
building
which
stood
a
little
apart
from
the
academy
and
was
fitted
up
with
all
the
appliances
that
are
supposed
to
be
necessary
or
useful
in
such
institutions
it
was
filled
with
students
who
were
exercising
their
muscles
in
various
ways
and
among
them
don
recognized
some
of
the
boys
who
had
composed
the
hazing
party
don
was
introduced
to
them
one
after
another
and
was
welcomed
by
them
in
the
most
cordial
manner
they
spent
a
few
minutes
in
talking
and
laughing
over
the
incidents
of
the
previous
night
and
then
at
a
sign
from
fisher
they
drew
off
on
one
side
so
that
they
could
carry
on
their
conversation
without
danger
of
being
overheard
by
those
who
did
not
belong
to
their
fellows
gordon
is
one
of
us
duncan
and
i
vouch
for
him
so
you
need
not
hesitate
to
speak
freely
in
his
presence
said
tom
again
taking
up
the
subject
that
just
then
was
nearest
his
heart
do
we
go
to
cony
ryan
s
or
not
of
course
replied
all
the
boys
in
chorus
then
that
much
is
settled
i
know
who
the
guards
are
he
added
turning
to
don
and
i
will
see
you
safely
out
and
back
as
soon
as
we
are
out
of
the
but
how
am
i
going
to
get
out
interrupted
don
you
forget
the
sentry
who
has
charge
of
our
no
i
don
t
here
he
is
said
tom
taking
by
the
arm
a
boy
who
had
been
introduced
as
charley
porter
you
won
t
stop
him
will
you
charley
i
shall
not
know
when
he
goes
out
was
the
ready
answer
i
can
be
both
blind
and
deaf
when
circumstances
require
that
i
should
be
you
see
what
kind
of
fellows
we
are
said
tom
you
will
never
be
reported
for
having
a
light
after
taps
or
for
any
other
offence
by
one
of
tom
then
went
on
to
tell
don
just
what
he
must
do
in
order
to
make
his
undertaking
successful
and
aided
by
his
friends
who
put
in
a
word
now
and
then
succeeded
in
making
him
believe
that
cony
ryan
s
was
but
little
short
of
a
paradise
and
that
he
tom
and
his
set
had
done
him
a
great
favor
in
bringing
the
house
and
its
proprietor
to
his
notice
he
promised
to
be
on
hand
at
the
hour
appointed
and
then
he
and
tom
went
into
the
to
put
on
their
gymnastic
suits
while
duncan
hurried
away
to
carry
out
an
idea
of
his
own
that
had
suddenly
suggested
itself
to
him
chapter
vi
cony
ryan
s
pancakes
he
did
bite
didn
t
he
said
duncan
to
himself
as
he
hurried
about
the
grounds
and
through
the
academy
building
looking
everywhere
for
dick
henderson
he
jumped
at
the
bait
quicker
than
i
thought
he
would
but
he
never
would
have
done
it
if
he
had
not
got
himself
into
trouble
last
night
that
made
him
mad
and
now
he
don
t
much
care
what
he
does
we
ll
fix
him
a
and
extra
lessons
and
guard
duty
and
drills
for
a
whole
month
will
so
disgust
him
with
this
school
that
he
will
clear
out
and
we
shall
be
well
rid
of
duncan
soon
found
the
boy
of
whom
he
was
in
search
and
the
following
is
a
part
of
the
conversation
that
took
place
between
them
you
are
on
post
no
down
there
at
the
north
side
of
the
grounds
are
you
not
said
duncan
dick
replied
that
he
was
that
he
went
on
at
midnight
well
you
know
that
the
boys
are
going
down
to
cony
ryan
s
don
t
you
continued
clarence
yes
dick
knew
all
about
it
and
stood
ready
to
help
them
in
every
way
he
could
without
getting
himself
into
trouble
well
said
duncan
again
don
gordon
is
going
with
dick
seemed
delighted
to
hear
it
we
roped
him
in
just
as
easy
as
falling
off
a
log
clarence
went
on
he
has
been
introduced
to
some
of
the
fellows
and
fisher
and
i
have
worked
things
so
nicely
that
he
doesn
t
suspect
anything
now
you
must
be
on
the
alert
to
catch
him
when
we
come
back
which
will
be
some
time
between
one
and
four
o
how
shall
i
know
him
from
the
rest
of
you
by
the
signal
of
course
have
you
forgotten
that
here
duncan
coughed
slightly
and
in
a
peculiar
manner
no
i
haven
t
forgotten
it
i
only
want
to
know
just
how
things
are
going
to
be
managed
so
that
i
shall
not
make
any
mistakes
it
would
be
awkward
you
know
if
i
should
call
the
corporal
of
the
guard
to
arrest
the
wrong
you
musn
t
do
that
said
duncan
quickly
it
would
be
much
better
to
let
gordon
pass
unchallenged
with
the
rest
of
us
you
know
we
boys
got
ourselves
into
lots
of
trouble
last
term
and
if
we
don
t
keep
our
names
off
the
from
this
time
on
we
stand
a
good
chance
of
being
sent
by
being
sent
down
duncan
meant
all
right
said
dick
i
know
just
what
you
want
of
me
do
everything
just
as
it
was
done
last
term
and
i
will
see
that
our
boys
get
safely
through
and
that
don
gordon
comes
in
for
a
when
the
hour
for
arrived
the
classes
were
marched
to
the
by
their
respective
captains
three
of
them
being
drawn
up
in
line
while
the
plebes
were
stationed
at
one
end
of
the
room
so
that
they
could
watch
the
movements
of
their
comrades
and
learn
something
of
the
duties
that
would
be
required
of
them
when
they
were
well
enough
drilled
in
the
manual
of
arms
and
school
of
the
company
to
go
on
parade
themselves
there
were
two
of
them
who
did
not
pay
much
attention
to
the
proceedings
although
they
appeared
to
watch
them
closely
and
they
were
don
and
bert
gordon
they
noticed
that
the
adjutant
carried
some
papers
in
his
belt
and
they
knew
instinctively
that
one
of
them
contained
something
that
would
prove
to
be
of
interest
to
them
in
obedience
to
the
adjutant
s
order
the
captains
brought
their
companies
to
parade
rest
the
band
sounded
off
a
few
exercises
in
the
manual
of
arms
were
gone
through
with
and
then
came
the
command
attention
to
don
listened
and
heard
his
name
and
bert
s
read
off
in
connection
with
those
of
three
or
four
other
culprits
who
were
ordered
to
be
punished
according
to
their
deserts
it
was
ordered
that
privates
donald
and
hubert
gordon
for
overstaying
their
time
and
having
a
light
burning
in
their
quarters
after
taps
this
being
their
second
offence
be
deprived
of
liberty
for
thirty
days
and
required
to
stand
guard
for
four
hours
on
the
ensuing
saturday
afternoon
with
packed
knapsacks
then
the
parade
was
dismissed
the
band
struck
up
a
lively
tune
the
officers
advanced
to
salute
the
commander
of
the
battalion
and
the
first
sergeants
marched
their
companies
to
the
armory
where
ranks
were
broken
didn
t
i
tell
you
just
how
it
would
be
whispered
fisher
who
happened
to
overtake
don
while
the
latter
was
on
his
way
to
his
room
it
s
no
trouble
at
all
to
stand
an
extra
for
it
is
over
with
in
four
hours
and
as
for
depriving
you
of
your
s
all
in
my
one
eye
you
can
see
much
more
fun
without
a
pass
than
you
can
with
one
for
you
are
not
obliged
to
return
at
any
specified
i
don
t
mind
the
punishment
as
much
as
i
do
the
disgrace
said
don
disgrace
echoed
fisher
nonsense
this
has
been
a
military
school
for
half
a
century
or
more
and
of
the
thousands
of
students
who
have
been
graduated
here
there
are
not
a
hundred
who
did
not
at
some
time
or
another
break
some
rule
and
get
punished
for
it
why
my
own
father
used
to
run
the
so
did
mine
said
don
father
exclaimed
tom
in
great
surprise
did
he
ever
attend
this
school
yes
he
received
a
military
education
and
prepared
for
college
i
am
surprised
to
hear
it
well
he
didn
t
get
through
the
whole
course
without
being
hauled
up
occasionally
did
he
i
just
know
he
didn
t
if
he
was
a
boy
who
had
any
spirit
in
him
now
as
i
may
not
see
you
again
until
the
time
for
action
arrives
i
want
to
know
if
you
understand
just
what
you
have
to
don
answered
that
he
was
sure
he
did
and
then
went
on
to
repeat
the
instructions
he
had
received
in
the
gymnasium
when
he
had
finished
fisher
gave
him
an
approving
wink
and
nod
and
left
him
during
the
evening
don
and
bert
did
very
little
studying
the
latter
took
his
punishment
very
much
to
heart
and
asked
himself
over
and
over
what
his
mother
would
think
when
she
heard
of
it
while
don
was
so
busy
thinking
of
the
festivities
that
were
to
come
off
at
cony
ryan
s
that
he
could
not
have
concentrated
his
mind
on
his
books
if
he
had
tried
when
taps
were
sounded
the
light
went
out
instanter
i
shall
never
get
into
trouble
for
again
said
don
as
he
tumbled
into
bed
after
bidding
his
brother
the
next
time
i
am
reported
it
will
be
for
something
that
is
worth
don
began
to
be
excited
now
he
had
been
instructed
to
wait
twenty
minutes
as
near
as
he
could
guess
at
it
in
order
to
give
the
officer
of
the
day
time
to
make
his
rounds
which
he
did
as
often
as
the
huge
bell
in
the
cupola
tolled
the
hours
he
knew
when
the
officer
ascended
the
stairs
heard
him
talking
with
the
sentry
who
had
charge
of
that
floor
and
breathed
easier
when
he
went
down
only
for
a
moment
for
now
something
that
appeared
to
be
an
insurmountable
obstacle
arose
before
him
all
on
a
sudden
the
sensitive
bert
was
sadly
troubled
and
when
he
got
that
way
it
was
almost
impossible
for
him
to
go
to
sleep
in
case
he
remained
awake
until
the
expiration
of
the
twenty
minutes
what
could
don
do
i
never
thought
of
that
soliloquized
the
latter
his
ears
telling
him
the
while
that
bert
was
tossing
restlessly
about
on
his
bed
it
would
be
simply
impossible
for
me
to
get
up
and
dress
and
slip
out
of
the
room
without
his
knowledge
of
course
i
might
go
out
openly
and
above
board
for
i
know
that
he
would
never
blow
on
me
but
if
i
do
that
he
will
improve
every
opportunity
to
lecture
me
and
i
would
rather
spend
every
saturday
afternoon
in
walking
extras
than
listen
to
him
i
ought
to
have
told
the
fellows
to
allow
me
at
least
an
while
don
was
busy
with
such
reflections
as
these
and
trying
in
vain
to
conjure
up
some
plan
for
leaving
the
room
without
attracting
his
brother
s
attention
he
was
electrified
by
a
gentle
snore
which
came
from
the
direction
of
bert
s
bed
don
thought
it
was
a
pleasant
sound
to
hear
just
then
for
it
told
him
that
the
way
was
clear
in
an
instant
he
was
out
on
the
floor
and
in
five
minutes
more
he
was
dressed
after
wrapping
one
of
his
pillows
up
in
the
quilts
and
arranging
them
as
well
as
he
could
in
the
dark
so
that
they
would
bear
some
resemblance
to
a
human
figure
he
walked
across
the
room
with
noiseless
steps
and
cautiously
opened
the
door
the
hall
was
lighted
up
by
a
single
under
which
the
sentry
charley
porter
sat
reading
a
book
he
looked
up
when
he
heard
don
s
door
grating
on
its
hinges
but
he
did
not
look
don
s
way
he
turned
his
eyes
in
the
other
direction
then
he
laid
down
his
book
got
upon
his
feet
and
walking
leisurely
along
the
hall
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
took
his
stand
in
front
of
a
window
and
looked
out
into
the
darkness
his
back
was
turned
toward
don
who
closed
the
door
of
his
room
behind
him
moved
along
the
hall
on
and
dodging
around
an
angle
in
the
wall
was
quickly
out
of
sight
a
few
hurried
steps
brought
him
to
another
door
which
yielded
to
his
touch
and
then
don
found
himself
in
utter
darkness
this
door
gave
access
to
the
back
stairs
which
ran
from
the
ground
floor
to
the
upper
story
of
the
building
and
were
intended
to
be
used
only
as
a
the
doors
that
opened
into
was
one
on
each
kept
locked
and
all
the
keys
that
rightfully
belonged
to
them
were
hung
up
on
a
nail
in
the
superintendent
s
room
where
they
could
be
readily
found
by
the
teachers
in
case
circumstances
required
that
they
should
be
brought
into
use
the
superintendent
was
happy
in
the
belief
that
by
placing
a
sentry
in
charge
of
the
dormitories
on
each
floor
and
keeping
the
keys
of
these
doors
under
his
eye
all
the
time
he
had
put
it
out
of
the
power
of
any
student
to
leave
the
building
during
the
night
but
he
had
not
taken
into
consideration
the
fact
that
sentries
may
sometimes
prove
false
to
their
duty
and
that
an
old
rusty
key
picked
up
in
the
yard
can
by
the
aid
of
a
file
and
a
little
ingenuity
be
made
to
fit
almost
any
lock
tom
fisher
and
his
friends
all
had
keys
that
would
open
these
doors
and
don
had
resolved
that
he
would
have
one
too
whispered
don
as
he
stepped
out
into
the
came
the
response
in
the
same
low
whisper
the
of
the
band
of
worthies
to
which
don
now
belonged
was
of
course
it
was
used
only
in
the
dark
or
when
the
members
could
not
see
each
other
if
a
boy
desired
to
know
whether
or
not
a
student
whom
he
suddenly
encountered
in
some
place
was
a
friend
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
spell
the
last
syllable
of
the
as
don
had
done
and
if
he
received
the
same
answer
that
don
did
he
knew
at
once
that
he
had
found
some
one
who
could
be
depended
on
at
least
that
was
what
fisher
and
duncan
told
don
but
the
reader
already
knows
that
they
did
not
tell
him
the
truth
who
is
it
whispered
don
fisher
replied
the
owner
of
that
name
and
as
he
spoke
he
stepped
forward
to
lock
the
door
hadn
t
you
better
leave
it
unfastened
asked
don
not
by
a
great
sight
answered
fisher
quickly
the
officer
of
the
day
and
the
corporal
on
duty
try
all
these
doors
every
time
they
make
their
rounds
and
if
they
should
happen
to
find
one
of
them
unlocked
to
all
our
hopes
of
eating
pies
and
pancakes
at
cony
ryan
s
again
this
then
how
can
i
get
back
to
my
room
why
i
shall
be
here
to
open
the
door
for
but
we
might
get
separated
you
oh
no
we
won
t
answered
tom
confidently
don
t
you
be
at
all
uneasy
on
that
score
duncan
and
i
will
stand
by
you
come
on
now
the
boys
are
all
ready
and
how
fearful
dark
it
is
said
don
i
can
t
see
my
hand
before
neither
can
i
but
i
have
been
through
here
so
often
that
i
know
every
step
of
the
way
give
me
your
fisher
took
don
in
tow
and
succeeded
in
conducting
him
safely
down
two
flights
of
afterward
proved
to
be
a
fortunate
thing
for
don
that
he
remembered
out
into
the
yard
where
duncan
and
the
rest
were
waiting
for
them
after
greeting
don
in
the
most
cordial
manner
they
moved
off
in
a
body
toward
the
north
corner
of
the
except
tom
fisher
who
went
on
ahead
to
notify
the
sentry
of
their
approach
this
he
did
in
some
mysterious
way
and
without
alarming
any
of
the
guards
on
the
neighboring
posts
and
the
boy
who
ought
to
have
called
the
corporal
of
the
guard
at
once
went
into
his
box
and
stayed
there
until
tom
and
his
companions
had
crossed
his
beat
and
were
out
of
sight
they
easily
found
the
place
where
two
of
the
tall
fence
pickets
had
been
loosened
at
the
bottom
and
pushing
these
aside
they
crept
through
the
opening
into
the
road
well
gordon
that
wasn
t
such
a
very
hard
thing
to
do
was
it
said
duncan
as
he
took
off
his
overcoat
and
shook
the
snow
out
of
it
no
answered
don
and
i
don
t
see
much
fun
in
it
either
it
is
not
a
very
smart
thing
to
crawl
by
a
sentry
who
is
accommodating
enough
to
keep
out
of
sight
until
you
have
had
time
to
get
out
of
harm
s
way
there
s
no
excitement
in
could
do
it
if
that
guard
had
been
faithful
to
his
trust
i
should
think
we
had
done
something
worth
bragging
o
you
want
excitement
do
you
exclaimed
duncan
you
want
a
chance
to
run
by
some
spooney
who
would
be
only
too
glad
to
report
you
and
get
you
into
a
row
don
t
you
all
right
we
ll
see
that
you
get
the
chance
and
very
shortly
too
won
t
we
boys
yes
replied
all
the
boys
in
concert
and
unless
i
am
very
badly
mistaken
you
will
see
quite
as
much
excitement
as
you
want
added
duncan
to
himself
if
dick
henderson
does
his
duty
you
will
be
under
arrest
and
a
candidate
for
a
before
you
see
the
inside
of
your
dormitory
during
the
walk
to
the
big
pond
near
which
cony
ryan
s
house
stood
don
s
new
friends
entertained
him
with
many
thrilling
stories
of
the
deeds
of
daring
that
had
been
performed
by
themselves
and
former
students
such
as
running
the
guard
when
all
the
posts
were
occupied
by
those
who
were
not
friendly
to
them
stealing
the
when
the
cupola
was
guarded
by
some
of
the
best
soldiers
in
the
academy
turning
the
bell
upside
down
on
a
cold
night
filling
it
with
water
and
allowing
it
to
freeze
solid
and
spiking
the
gun
whose
unwelcome
booming
aroused
them
at
so
early
an
hour
every
morning
as
don
listened
he
began
to
grow
excited
and
when
there
was
a
little
lull
in
the
conversation
he
proposed
one
or
two
daring
schemes
of
his
own
that
had
suddenly
occurred
to
him
and
which
were
so
far
ahead
of
any
his
auditors
had
ever
engaged
in
that
they
could
hardly
believe
he
was
in
earnest
gordon
you
see
around
you
a
lot
of
fellows
who
never
have
and
never
will
back
down
from
any
reasonable
undertaking
said
tom
fisher
but
the
idea
of
stealing
a
cow
taking
her
into
the
grounds
and
hoisting
her
up
to
the
top
of
the
belfry
overpowering
and
binding
every
sentry
who
stands
in
our
cæsar
s
ghost
gordon
you
must
be
taking
leave
of
your
and
as
for
taking
the
butcher
s
big
up
to
the
top
story
of
the
building
tying
a
tin
can
to
his
tail
and
starting
him
on
a
run
down
four
pairs
of
stairs
and
through
the
s
another
thing
i
don
t
approve
of
said
duncan
i
guess
not
said
another
of
the
fellows
i
wouldn
t
touch
that
dog
for
a
million
dollars
we
are
in
for
anything
new
that
promises
to
be
either
interesting
or
exciting
but
as
tom
says
it
must
be
something
reasonable
think
up
some
other
the
boys
had
by
this
time
reached
cony
ryan
s
house
led
by
tom
fisher
they
mounted
the
steps
and
passing
through
a
narrow
hall
entered
a
neatly
furnished
little
parlor
whose
walls
could
they
have
found
tongues
would
have
told
some
strange
and
amusing
stories
of
the
scenes
that
had
been
enacted
there
it
was
brilliantly
lighted
and
a
cheerful
fire
burned
in
the
grate
this
looks
as
though
cony
was
expecting
us
doesn
t
it
said
tom
gazing
about
the
room
with
a
smile
of
satisfaction
take
off
your
overcoat
gordon
and
sit
down
make
yourself
at
do
you
know
added
duncan
that
this
house
was
built
and
furnished
with
the
money
that
the
academy
boys
have
put
into
cony
s
pocket
years
ago
when
he
was
nothing
but
a
poor
fisherman
and
lived
down
there
on
the
bank
of
the
river
in
a
little
shanty
about
half
the
size
of
this
room
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
turn
an
honest
penny
by
supplying
the
students
with
milk
and
pies
he
drove
a
thriving
trade
until
some
of
the
teachers
began
to
suspect
that
he
was
putting
something
stronger
than
water
in
his
milk
and
then
they
shut
down
on
him
and
he
was
forbidden
to
enter
the
grounds
but
that
didn
t
trouble
him
any
the
boys
had
got
in
the
habit
of
spending
their
extra
dimes
with
him
and
since
he
couldn
t
come
to
them
any
more
they
fell
into
the
way
of
going
to
him
why
gordon
if
you
could
look
over
some
of
his
old
registers
you
would
find
in
them
the
names
of
men
who
are
known
all
over
the
just
then
a
side
door
opened
admitting
a
portly
old
fellow
dressed
in
a
modest
suit
of
black
who
was
greeted
by
the
students
in
the
most
uproarious
manner
they
crowded
around
him
all
trying
to
shake
his
hands
at
the
same
time
while
cony
for
it
was
he
beamed
benevolently
upon
them
over
his
spectacles
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
seen
any
of
them
since
the
close
of
the
last
school
term
you
see
we
are
all
on
hand
again
cony
said
duncan
when
the
greetings
were
over
and
if
you
will
trot
out
a
few
plates
of
your
pancakes
you
will
find
that
we
are
as
hungry
as
ever
by
the
way
did
you
know
a
boy
of
the
name
of
gordon
who
used
to
attend
this
academy
gordon
of
mississippi
exclaimed
cony
who
having
a
retentive
memory
never
forgot
the
names
of
any
of
his
patrons
i
should
say
so
he
has
spent
many
a
pleasant
evening
in
this
well
here
is
one
of
his
boys
continued
duncan
mr
ryan
donald
the
old
fellow
was
very
much
surprised
it
doesn
t
seem
possible
said
he
as
he
shook
don
s
hand
and
gave
him
a
good
looking
over
he
is
the
very
image
of
his
father
who
was
one
of
the
young
soldiers
i
ever
put
my
eyes
on
mercy
on
us
how
time
does
fly
say
cony
said
tom
fisher
coaxingly
can
t
we
have
just
one
game
of
sell
out
no
sir
was
the
emphatic
reply
you
can
have
all
the
pancakes
you
want
and
as
much
sweet
milk
or
buttermilk
as
you
can
hold
but
you
don
t
turn
a
card
in
this
house
it
is
bad
enough
for
you
to
run
the
guard
and
if
i
did
my
duty
i
should
report
the
last
one
of
you
in
the
suppose
you
trot
out
the
pancakes
and
milk
and
let
somebody
else
report
us
suggested
don
yes
that
s
the
idea
cried
the
others
with
one
voice
don
thought
he
enjoyed
himself
that
night
and
his
companions
thought
so
too
for
he
sang
as
many
songs
told
as
many
stories
and
laughed
as
heartily
as
any
of
them
he
listened
with
much
interest
while
cony
told
of
the
exploits
of
the
students
he
had
known
in
the
years
gone
by
and
who
had
since
made
themselves
famous
as
lawyers
legislators
and
soldiers
and
was
greatly
astonished
when
tom
fisher
jumped
to
his
feet
with
his
watch
in
his
hand
and
a
look
of
alarm
on
his
face
fellows
said
he
where
has
the
night
gone
it
is
three
and
we
have
just
half
an
hour
in
which
to
crawl
by
dick
henderson
s
post
and
get
into
bed
if
we
are
two
minutes
behind
time
we
are
a
gone
this
startling
announcement
broke
up
the
party
at
once
the
boys
made
a
simultaneous
rush
for
their
overcoats
and
caps
and
after
don
had
settled
their
proceeding
on
his
part
that
raised
him
to
a
high
place
in
the
estimation
of
some
of
the
students
whose
parents
did
not
think
it
best
to
give
them
a
very
liberal
allowance
of
spending
dashed
out
of
the
house
and
started
for
the
academy
on
a
dead
run
duncan
and
don
gordon
bringing
up
the
rear
if
the
latter
had
known
what
the
boy
who
kept
so
close
to
his
elbow
was
thinking
about
he
would
have
thrown
him
headlong
into
the
nearest
chapter
vii
running
the
guard
now
boys
said
tom
fisher
one
at
a
time
but
remember
lively
is
the
word
gordon
you
had
better
stay
back
and
watch
the
rest
of
us
and
then
you
will
know
how
to
proceed
when
your
turn
comes
we
are
not
afraid
of
henderson
but
still
we
don
t
want
to
show
ourselves
to
him
too
plainly
for
fear
that
the
corporal
of
the
guard
or
the
officer
of
the
day
may
be
loafing
around
somewhere
within
sight
of
his
they
had
now
reached
the
academy
grounds
and
half
the
time
at
their
disposal
had
already
been
consumed
they
had
barely
fifteen
minutes
left
and
haste
was
necessary
as
matters
stood
all
the
floors
and
one
of
the
outside
beats
were
in
charge
of
boys
who
had
been
duly
posted
and
would
permit
them
to
pass
unchallenged
but
these
accommodating
guards
would
very
soon
be
relieved
and
their
places
taken
by
those
who
would
report
them
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
as
fisher
spoke
he
pushed
aside
the
loosened
squeezed
himself
through
the
opening
and
with
his
body
half
bent
made
his
way
toward
dick
henderson
s
post
presently
he
threw
himself
upon
his
hands
and
knees
and
in
a
few
seconds
more
was
out
of
sight
another
and
another
followed
him
and
finally
duncan
took
his
turn
and
don
was
left
alone
don
t
be
in
too
great
a
hurry
were
the
latter
s
parting
words
let
me
get
out
of
your
sight
before
you
during
the
last
hour
and
a
half
dick
henderson
had
been
walking
his
beat
in
no
very
pleasant
frame
of
mind
tom
had
told
him
that
he
and
his
friends
would
return
some
time
between
the
hours
of
two
and
four
but
at
three
o
clock
dick
had
seen
no
signs
of
them
i
wonder
if
they
went
in
at
some
other
part
of
the
grounds
dick
often
said
to
himself
i
can
t
believe
they
did
for
i
think
i
am
the
only
fellow
in
our
crowd
who
holds
an
outside
post
besides
duncan
said
they
would
come
in
here
so
that
i
could
halt
don
gordon
they
ll
have
to
hurry
up
if
they
want
me
to
do
anything
for
as
the
minutes
wore
away
dick
s
anxiety
increased
and
finally
he
became
really
alarmed
the
bell
had
struck
three
long
ago
and
dick
was
beginning
to
look
for
his
relief
when
to
his
great
joy
he
saw
somebody
creeping
toward
him
through
the
deep
snow
as
soon
as
he
caught
sight
of
him
he
moved
back
to
his
box
and
stood
behind
it
leaning
on
his
musket
the
boy
tom
fisher
crossed
dick
s
beat
in
plain
view
of
him
uttering
a
peculiar
cough
as
he
passed
and
disappeared
behind
the
high
piles
of
snow
that
had
been
thrown
out
of
the
path
leading
to
the
academy
that
s
one
thought
dick
and
duncan
said
there
were
to
be
nine
in
the
party
i
am
to
allow
eight
of
them
to
go
in
peace
and
the
ninth
man
who
will
be
don
gordon
is
to
be
halted
and
turned
over
to
the
tender
mercies
of
the
officer
of
the
day
that
is
two
he
added
as
another
boy
crept
by
giving
the
signal
as
he
went
when
the
eighth
man
was
safely
out
of
sight
dick
shouldered
his
musket
and
stepping
out
from
behind
his
box
prepared
for
action
as
he
came
into
view
a
boy
who
was
moving
rapidly
toward
him
in
a
crouching
attitude
suddenly
stopped
and
then
as
suddenly
plunged
into
the
nearest
snowdrift
burying
himself
in
it
head
and
ears
that
fellow
is
like
an
ostrich
soliloquized
dick
as
he
walked
quickly
along
his
beat
he
thinks
that
because
his
head
is
out
of
sight
his
whole
body
is
having
taken
up
a
position
between
the
recumbent
figure
and
the
path
that
led
from
his
beat
to
the
academy
dick
brought
his
musket
to
arms
port
and
sung
out
in
his
loudest
tones
who
comes
there
immediately
following
up
his
challenge
with
lusty
calls
for
the
corporal
of
the
guard
no
the
last
words
had
hardly
left
his
lips
when
the
prostrate
boy
sprang
to
his
feet
and
coughing
up
the
snow
which
had
filled
his
mouth
and
got
into
his
throat
when
he
made
his
sudden
plunge
into
the
drift
ran
toward
the
academy
with
surprising
swiftness
dick
heard
that
cough
and
it
affected
him
very
strangely
he
stood
with
open
mouth
and
eyes
gazing
in
the
direction
in
which
the
boy
had
disappeared
while
his
musket
trembled
in
his
grasp
and
his
face
grew
almost
as
white
as
the
snow
around
him
now
i
ve
done
it
he
said
to
himself
with
no
little
alarm
i
ve
gone
and
called
the
corporal
for
one
of
our
own
boys
what
in
the
world
shall
i
do
tom
and
clarence
will
read
me
out
of
their
good
books
and
i
shall
have
no
one
to
be
friends
with
for
those
lads
in
the
upper
classes
won
t
look
at
me
well
if
trouble
comes
of
it
they
can
just
blame
duncan
he
told
me
to
stop
the
ninth
boy
and
i
know
i
didn
t
make
any
mistake
in
counting
them
but
what
shall
i
say
to
the
corporal
that
s
what
bothers
dick
was
obliged
to
come
to
a
decision
on
this
point
very
speedily
for
just
then
the
door
of
the
was
thrown
open
and
the
corporal
came
out
and
hurried
toward
him
what
s
the
matter
sentry
he
asked
as
soon
as
he
had
approached
within
speaking
distance
some
fellow
has
just
run
by
me
was
dick
s
reply
whew
whistled
the
corporal
running
the
guard
has
begun
rather
early
in
the
term
hasn
t
it
who
was
he
i
don
t
know
answered
dick
and
he
told
the
truth
whom
did
he
look
like
i
don
t
know
that
either
you
can
t
tell
one
student
from
another
in
the
dark
when
they
are
all
dressed
then
why
didn
t
you
catch
him
and
find
out
who
he
was
catch
him
repeated
dick
cony
ryan
s
grayhound
couldn
t
have
caught
him
he
ran
like
a
well
he
ll
be
stopped
when
he
tries
to
get
into
his
dormitory
said
the
corporal
indifferently
i
ll
go
and
see
what
the
officer
of
the
day
thinks
about
it
you
re
sure
this
fellow
whoever
he
was
didn
t
go
out
since
you
have
been
on
post
of
course
he
didn
t
said
dick
indignantly
then
patchen
that
was
the
name
of
the
sentry
who
held
post
no
when
fisher
and
his
companions
left
the
grounds
will
have
to
answer
to
the
superintendent
for
neglect
of
duty
said
the
corporal
as
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
walked
back
toward
the
and
just
as
likely
as
not
he
will
punch
my
head
for
getting
him
into
trouble
thought
dick
trembling
again
but
i
didn
t
mean
to
do
it
it
s
all
that
clarence
duncan
s
fault
for
he
ought
to
have
told
me
that
he
was
going
to
add
more
boys
to
his
party
don
gordon
must
be
outside
the
grounds
yet
and
perhaps
some
of
our
boys
are
with
meanwhile
tom
fisher
having
gained
the
academy
building
in
safety
opened
the
back
door
climbed
two
pairs
of
stairs
and
felt
his
way
along
the
hall
to
the
door
that
gave
entrance
to
the
floor
on
which
don
gordon
s
dormitory
was
situated
this
door
he
unlocked
and
opened
and
stepping
into
the
next
hall
saw
the
sentry
who
had
relieved
charley
porter
at
midnight
sitting
under
the
light
reading
a
book
ahem
said
tom
whereupon
the
sentry
laid
down
his
book
and
walked
toward
him
well
you
fellows
have
made
a
night
of
it
haven
t
you
said
he
in
a
cautious
whisper
i
should
think
so
answered
tom
had
a
splendid
time
too
the
pancakes
were
just
as
good
as
they
used
to
be
and
gordon
settled
the
bill
like
a
you
had
better
go
to
bed
and
be
in
a
hurry
about
it
too
said
the
sentry
it
is
almost
time
for
me
to
be
i
know
it
but
i
promised
to
wait
at
this
door
and
let
gordon
in
he
has
no
key
of
his
if
he
doesn
t
come
along
pretty
soon
he
ll
not
get
in
morning
without
being
reported
for
gulick
comes
after
is
that
so
then
he
d
better
hurry
that
s
a
fact
i
can
t
wait
much
longer
for
him
without
bringing
myself
into
the
sentry
who
did
not
dare
remain
longer
in
conversation
with
tom
for
fear
that
the
officer
of
the
day
or
the
corporal
of
the
guard
might
come
quietly
up
the
stairs
and
catch
him
at
it
walked
away
toward
the
other
end
of
the
hall
while
tom
closed
the
door
and
stood
there
in
the
dark
impatiently
awaiting
the
arrival
of
don
gordon
he
heard
his
friends
as
they
crossed
the
landing
one
after
another
and
went
on
up
to
their
dormitories
but
the
boy
he
wanted
to
see
did
not
make
his
appearance
presently
some
one
jerked
open
the
back
door
slammed
it
behind
him
and
came
up
the
stairs
in
great
haste
who
is
that
idiot
i
wonder
he
makes
noise
enough
to
arouse
the
whole
school
whispered
tom
as
the
boy
sprang
upon
the
landing
came
the
prompt
response
who
is
it
continued
tom
well
you
are
making
a
fearful
racket
the
first
thing
you
know
said
tom
angrily
i
am
in
a
hurry
panted
the
boy
here
s
the
very
mischief
to
pay
that
fool
henderson
has
gone
and
challenged
one
of
our
no
gasped
tom
who
was
greatly
alarmed
but
i
say
he
has
for
i
heard
him
come
on
we
musn
t
stay
here
another
but
i
promised
to
let
gordon
in
said
tom
what
do
you
care
for
gordon
let
him
go
and
take
care
of
yourself
that
s
what
i
am
going
to
so
saying
the
boy
went
on
up
the
stairs
leaving
tom
to
himself
the
latter
could
not
make
up
his
mind
what
to
do
he
knew
that
he
was
in
danger
but
still
he
did
not
like
to
desert
don
in
his
extremity
don
speaking
in
parlance
had
shown
himself
to
be
a
thoroughbred
he
could
sing
a
good
song
tell
an
interesting
story
and
better
than
all
he
was
provided
with
a
liberal
supply
of
which
he
spent
with
a
lavish
hand
this
was
enough
to
raise
him
to
a
high
place
in
the
estimation
of
tom
fisher
whose
own
supply
of
dimes
was
limited
i
have
it
soliloquized
tom
at
length
i
ll
leave
the
key
in
the
lock
and
if
he
succeeds
in
getting
by
the
guard
he
can
let
himself
in
of
course
he
will
have
sense
enough
to
fasten
the
door
after
him
and
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
henderson
will
have
to
explain
his
conduct
in
the
morning
he
had
no
business
to
halt
any
of
our
fellows
unless
he
did
it
to
protect
tom
hurriedly
ascended
the
next
flight
of
stairs
but
scarcely
had
he
reached
the
top
when
the
back
door
was
thrown
open
again
and
another
boy
came
bounding
up
the
steps
it
was
clarence
duncan
who
was
congratulating
himself
on
the
complete
success
of
his
plans
he
lingered
a
moment
or
two
in
the
hall
where
fisher
had
stood
waiting
for
don
gordon
and
then
went
on
to
his
own
dormitory
the
was
so
very
deeply
interested
in
a
dime
novel
that
he
did
not
appear
to
see
or
hear
him
as
he
passed
and
in
a
few
seconds
more
clarence
was
safe
in
bed
he
was
just
in
time
he
had
not
been
between
the
sheets
two
minutes
before
he
heard
the
gruff
tones
of
the
officer
of
the
day
who
was
questioning
the
clarence
could
not
hear
what
they
said
but
he
knew
what
they
were
talking
about
presently
he
heard
doors
softly
opened
and
closed
the
sounds
came
nearer
and
at
last
the
door
of
his
own
room
was
opened
and
the
officer
of
the
day
attended
by
the
corporal
of
the
guard
who
carried
a
lantern
in
his
hand
stepped
across
the
threshold
the
officer
saw
duncan
and
fisher
lying
with
their
faces
to
the
wall
apparently
fast
asleep
took
note
of
the
fact
that
their
clothes
were
deposited
in
orderly
array
upon
the
chairs
at
the
side
of
their
beds
and
departed
satisfied
with
his
investigations
in
a
few
minutes
the
relief
came
up
and
clarence
began
to
breathe
easier
say
fisher
he
whispered
are
you
asleep
no
was
the
reply
and
what
s
more
i
don
t
want
to
go
to
sleep
if
i
do
i
am
afraid
i
shall
miss
and
then
the
superintendent
would
know
where
to
look
to
find
at
least
one
fellow
who
ran
the
i
think
myself
that
it
would
be
a
good
plan
for
us
to
keep
awake
say
fisher
whispered
clarence
again
gordon
s
goose
is
what
do
you
mean
by
that
i
mean
just
what
i
say
i
shall
be
amply
revenged
on
him
for
the
insults
he
has
heaped
upon
us
when
we
came
through
the
fence
i
managed
to
keep
him
until
the
last
and
henderson
halted
him
i
didn
t
know
but
he
might
succeed
in
getting
by
in
spite
of
dick
s
efforts
to
stop
him
so
in
order
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure
i
took
the
pains
to
examine
the
door
in
the
second
hall
and
in
it
i
found
a
key
that
some
kind
friend
had
left
there
for
his
benefit
but
i
just
took
the
key
out
of
that
lock
and
put
it
into
my
pocket
don
can
t
possibly
get
in
without
being
reported
by
the
and
he
can
take
his
choice
between
freezing
outside
and
giving
himself
up
to
the
did
you
tell
henderson
to
halt
him
demanded
fisher
who
had
listened
with
the
greatest
amazement
to
this
astounding
revelation
yes
sir
i
did
chuckled
duncan
who
seemed
to
be
highly
elated
i
posted
dick
yesterday
afternoon
and
he
carried
out
my
idea
to
a
dot
i
didn
t
expect
to
get
even
with
gordon
so
soon
did
you
well
of
all
the
i
ever
saw
you
are
the
greatest
said
tom
in
deep
disgust
why
what
s
the
matter
demanded
duncan
who
was
now
surprised
in
his
turn
what
are
you
going
to
do
he
added
as
tom
got
out
of
his
bed
and
moved
toward
the
door
i
am
going
to
see
if
there
is
any
chance
for
me
to
undo
your
miserable
work
replied
tom
who
was
so
enraged
that
he
could
scarcely
speak
you
have
made
a
nice
mess
by
your
meddling
why
didn
t
you
ask
the
advice
of
the
rest
of
us
before
issuing
any
orders
on
your
own
responsibility
you
re
just
a
trifle
too
smart
to
be
of
any
use
to
me
opening
the
door
tom
looked
out
into
the
hall
and
saw
at
a
glance
that
he
could
do
nothing
to
help
the
unlucky
don
he
had
intended
if
it
were
possible
to
go
down
to
the
lower
floor
and
put
the
key
back
in
the
lock
so
that
don
could
use
it
in
case
he
succeeded
by
any
chance
in
getting
past
the
sentry
but
he
could
not
carry
this
plan
into
execution
now
because
the
who
had
permitted
himself
and
duncan
and
all
the
other
boys
who
belonged
on
that
floor
to
pass
unnoticed
had
been
relieved
and
his
chair
was
occupied
by
a
boy
who
could
not
be
fooled
with
anything
wanting
fisher
asked
the
sentry
looking
up
from
his
book
i
thought
somebody
came
into
my
room
a
few
minutes
ago
said
tom
in
reply
so
there
did
it
was
the
officer
of
the
what
did
he
want
not
much
of
anything
only
to
make
sure
that
you
were
in
bed
where
you
what
s
up
somebody
has
been
running
the
guard
that
s
did
they
catch
him
no
and
neither
did
henderson
recognize
him
there
s
something
mysterious
about
it
as
far
as
i
can
learn
there
is
no
one
missing
and
the
are
all
willing
to
swear
that
nobody
has
passed
in
or
out
of
the
academy
since
taps
as
this
was
a
hint
that
the
sentry
did
not
want
to
talk
any
longer
tom
drew
in
his
head
and
closed
the
door
now
i
beat
said
he
aloud
and
so
was
duncan
who
had
sat
up
in
bed
and
heard
every
word
that
passed
between
his
and
the
sentry
gordon
was
stopped
by
dick
henderson
locked
out
in
the
cold
through
your
lack
of
sense
and
yet
the
officer
of
the
day
finds
him
in
his
room
how
does
that
come
i
can
t
understand
neither
can
i
said
duncan
but
tom
what
made
you
get
so
angry
at
me
i
had
two
reasons
for
it
in
the
first
place
you
had
no
right
to
tell
henderson
to
stop
don
until
you
found
out
what
the
rest
of
us
thought
about
it
you
took
altogether
too
much
upon
yourself
when
you
presumed
to
act
for
a
dozen
or
more
fellows
in
the
way
you
have
you
forgotten
that
gordon
has
repeatedly
neglected
to
salute
us
and
that
he
threatened
to
make
of
the
pair
of
us
demanded
clarence
i
wanted
to
get
even
with
him
for
that
s
no
excuse
i
want
to
get
even
with
him
too
and
what
is
more
i
intend
to
do
it
but
i
never
would
have
given
my
consent
to
your
idea
as
you
call
it
while
we
were
coming
from
cony
s
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
propose
to
the
boys
to
take
gordon
into
full
fellowship
with
us
and
stand
by
him
through
thick
and
thin
until
near
the
close
of
the
term
and
when
we
had
enjoyed
all
the
treats
we
could
squeeze
out
of
him
we
d
go
for
him
he
s
got
a
lot
of
money
and
what
s
more
to
the
point
he
is
perfectly
willing
to
spend
that
s
so
said
duncan
thoughtfully
your
idea
is
better
than
mine
why
didn
t
you
speak
of
it
before
i
should
have
thought
your
own
good
sense
if
you
had
any
would
have
suggested
it
to
you
answered
tom
i
have
been
thinking
about
it
ever
since
we
left
cony
s
your
governor
and
mine
have
curtailed
our
allowance
and
unless
somebody
foots
the
bills
for
us
how
are
we
going
to
get
any
pancakes
this
term
besides
we
may
want
to
borrow
a
dollar
occasionally
and
i
know
gordon
will
give
it
to
us
if
we
only
handle
him
that
s
so
said
duncan
again
i
wish
i
had
kept
away
from
so
do
i
we
may
see
trouble
over
that
thing
yet
i
wish
it
was
morning
i
shall
be
on
nettles
until
i
see
don
in
the
ranks
i
hope
he
will
get
in
all
right
but
somehow
i
can
t
bring
myself
to
believe
that
he
the
two
boys
did
not
sleep
a
wink
that
morning
rather
they
rolled
and
tossed
about
on
their
beds
waiting
impatiently
for
the
report
of
the
morning
gun
which
finally
rang
out
on
the
frosty
air
being
followed
almost
immediately
by
the
rattle
of
drums
and
the
shrieking
of
fifes
in
the
they
marched
down
with
their
company
and
while
the
roll
was
being
called
they
ran
their
eyes
over
the
plebes
who
were
drawn
up
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
there
was
don
gordon
in
the
front
rank
looking
as
fresh
as
a
daisy
and
as
innocent
as
though
he
had
never
violated
a
rule
in
his
life
he
did
get
in
didn
t
he
said
duncan
while
he
and
fisher
were
clearing
up
their
room
in
readiness
for
inspection
he
didn
t
seem
any
the
worse
for
his
night
s
experience
either
but
did
you
notice
dick
henderson
his
face
was
as
long
as
your
having
received
positive
proof
that
don
had
succeeded
in
reaching
his
room
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
had
been
locked
against
him
tom
and
his
companion
their
friendly
relations
having
been
fully
restored
by
the
unexpected
and
mysterious
failure
of
duncan
s
idea
became
anxious
to
know
how
he
had
done
it
during
the
two
hours
of
study
that
came
after
the
inspection
of
their
rooms
they
did
not
look
at
their
books
as
soon
as
breakfast
was
over
and
the
ranks
were
broken
they
put
on
their
overcoats
and
went
out
in
search
of
don
they
found
him
in
a
very
few
minutes
for
he
was
also
looking
for
them
he
was
just
as
anxious
to
know
why
he
had
been
challenged
while
the
other
members
of
the
party
were
allowed
to
pass
as
they
were
to
ascertain
how
he
had
got
back
to
his
room
before
any
of
the
three
could
speak
dick
henderson
came
rushing
up
o
boys
he
began
that
will
do
for
the
present
bub
interrupted
duncan
run
away
now
like
a
good
little
but
i
say
fellows
exclaimed
dick
well
say
it
some
other
time
we
are
busy
just
let
him
speak
said
don
i
want
him
to
tell
why
he
stopped
me
this
i
didn
t
stop
you
replied
dick
that
s
a
fact
you
didn
t
but
you
tried
to
all
the
same
and
i
want
to
know
what
you
meant
by
why
gordon
it
can
t
be
possible
that
you
dick
was
about
to
ask
don
if
he
was
the
boy
who
tried
to
bury
himself
out
of
sight
in
a
snowdrift
and
who
jumped
up
and
ran
toward
the
academy
when
the
corporal
of
the
guard
was
summoned
but
he
was
interrupted
by
a
look
from
duncan
then
the
latter
pointed
with
his
thumb
over
his
shoulder
and
dick
who
understood
the
motion
beat
a
hasty
retreat
looking
crestfallen
as
well
as
bewildered
he
committed
a
most
inexcusable
blunder
and
came
very
near
getting
the
whole
of
us
into
hot
water
said
fisher
who
knew
that
he
must
offer
something
in
the
way
of
explanation
we
will
give
him
a
good
talking
to
and
make
him
promise
to
be
more
careful
in
future
now
gordon
how
in
the
world
did
you
get
in
easy
enough
answered
don
i
say
boys
there
s
lots
of
fun
in
running
the
guard
and
some
little
excitement
too
i
am
ready
to
try
it
again
any
night
come
on
and
i
will
tell
you
all
about
the
three
boys
linked
their
arms
together
and
walked
toward
an
unfrequented
part
of
the
grounds
so
that
don
could
give
the
details
of
his
exploit
without
danger
of
being
overheard
we
will
tell
the
story
in
our
own
way
chapter
viii
how
don
got
in
don
t
be
in
too
great
a
hurry
let
me
get
out
of
your
sight
said
clarence
duncan
as
he
crept
through
the
fence
and
don
whose
suspicions
had
not
been
aroused
was
careful
to
obey
when
he
thought
that
clarence
had
been
allowed
time
to
reach
the
academy
he
passed
through
the
opening
and
moved
toward
dick
henderson
s
post
he
saw
the
latter
when
he
came
out
from
behind
his
box
and
walked
along
his
beat
and
remembering
tom
fisher
s
words
of
it
would
not
be
safe
to
approach
dick
s
post
openly
for
fear
that
the
officer
of
the
day
or
the
corporal
might
be
somewhere
within
sought
concealment
by
throwing
himself
at
full
length
in
the
snow
he
expected
to
see
dick
turn
about
and
go
behind
his
box
again
and
consequently
he
was
not
a
little
amazed
when
the
sentry
took
up
a
position
directly
in
front
of
him
and
called
for
the
corporal
of
the
guard
don
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
it
but
he
know
that
if
he
stayed
where
he
was
detection
and
punishment
were
inevitable
he
still
had
one
chance
for
escape
and
he
lost
no
time
in
improving
it
he
jumped
up
and
took
to
his
heels
trusting
to
the
darkness
and
to
his
uniform
to
conceal
his
identity
he
was
very
light
of
foot
and
by
doing
some
of
his
best
running
he
succeeded
in
dodging
around
the
corner
of
the
academy
building
just
as
the
corporal
threw
open
the
door
of
the
the
signal
which
had
produced
such
an
effect
upon
dick
henderson
he
had
given
by
the
merest
accident
it
was
one
that
fisher
by
some
oversight
had
neglected
to
teach
him
although
he
had
let
him
into
the
secret
of
all
the
other
signs
and
a
miss
is
as
good
as
a
mile
but
still
that
was
a
pretty
close
shave
said
don
to
himself
as
he
opened
the
back
door
and
felt
his
way
up
the
stairs
i
can
t
understand
why
dick
challenged
me
unless
it
was
because
my
approach
was
discovered
by
somebody
else
who
would
have
reported
him
if
he
hadn
t
tried
to
stop
on
reaching
the
second
landing
don
moved
cautiously
along
the
hall
spelling
the
last
syllable
of
the
as
he
went
greatly
to
his
surprise
he
met
with
no
response
when
his
hands
came
in
contact
with
the
door
he
began
searching
for
the
knob
but
when
he
turned
it
the
door
did
not
open
for
him
it
was
locked
now
here
s
a
go
thought
don
who
did
not
know
whether
to
laugh
or
get
angry
over
the
predicament
in
which
he
so
unexpectedly
found
himself
where
s
fisher
he
knew
very
well
that
i
couldn
t
get
to
my
room
without
assistance
and
yet
he
has
deserted
me
if
that
is
the
sort
of
fellow
he
is
he
ll
not
eat
any
more
pancakes
this
winter
at
my
having
satisfied
himself
that
tom
was
not
on
hand
as
he
had
promised
to
be
don
placed
his
ear
close
to
the
and
found
that
he
could
distinctly
hear
the
footsteps
of
the
as
he
paced
up
and
down
the
hall
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
there
was
a
fellow
who
could
and
would
help
him
if
he
could
only
attract
his
attention
waiting
with
all
the
patience
he
could
command
until
the
sentry
came
down
to
that
end
of
the
hall
again
don
rapped
softly
upon
the
door
and
in
a
peculiar
manner
the
footsteps
ceased
on
the
instant
the
sentry
was
listening
again
don
gave
the
mystic
quick
rap
then
after
a
little
pause
three
more
raps
delivered
in
rapid
succession
and
presently
a
voice
came
through
the
it
whispered
whispered
don
in
reply
who
is
it
a
moment
later
a
key
rattled
in
the
lock
the
door
swung
open
and
don
stood
face
to
face
with
the
sentry
where
s
fisher
demanded
the
latter
that
s
just
what
i
should
like
to
know
answered
don
he
said
he
would
be
here
to
let
me
in
but
i
haven
t
seen
anything
of
he
s
a
pretty
fellow
exclaimed
the
sentry
i
don
t
know
whether
you
can
reach
your
room
or
not
the
guards
have
been
aroused
and
i
am
expecting
the
officer
of
the
day
every
minute
but
i
ll
do
the
best
i
can
for
you
stay
here
till
i
come
the
sentry
was
not
gone
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
minute
he
went
as
far
as
the
head
of
the
stairs
that
led
to
the
floor
below
and
then
he
turned
and
ran
back
on
you
re
too
late
said
he
the
officer
of
the
day
is
down
stairs
and
he
ll
be
up
here
in
a
second
you
might
as
well
come
out
and
give
yourself
up
for
the
boy
who
comes
after
me
will
not
pass
i
can
t
help
that
replied
don
i
ll
not
give
myself
up
that
isn
t
my
the
sentry
had
seen
many
a
boy
in
a
tight
corner
but
he
had
never
before
seen
one
who
took
matters
as
coolly
as
don
did
all
the
other
students
of
his
acquaintance
would
have
been
frightened
when
they
found
that
every
avenue
of
escape
was
closed
against
them
but
don
was
as
serene
as
a
summer
s
morning
you
re
a
plucky
one
said
the
sentry
and
i
am
sorry
that
i
can
not
help
you
if
my
out
of
sight
quick
he
added
as
a
heavy
step
sounded
on
the
stairs
that
s
the
officer
of
the
day
and
if
he
finds
this
door
unlocked
i
shall
be
in
as
bad
a
box
as
you
don
went
back
into
the
hall
his
movements
being
quickened
by
a
gentle
push
from
the
sentry
who
having
closed
and
locked
the
door
succeeded
in
reaching
his
own
hall
just
a
second
before
the
officer
of
the
day
appeared
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
close
at
his
heels
came
the
corporal
of
the
guard
who
carried
a
lighted
lantern
in
his
hand
sentry
said
the
officer
have
any
of
your
men
left
their
rooms
not
since
i
have
been
on
post
sir
replied
the
sentry
the
beds
were
all
occupied
half
an
hour
we
will
look
into
this
matter
corporal
said
the
officer
and
as
he
spoke
he
led
the
way
to
the
farther
end
of
the
hall
to
begin
an
examination
of
the
rooms
the
sentry
knew
that
he
would
do
this
and
he
awaited
the
issue
of
events
with
no
little
uneasiness
somebody
is
in
for
a
regular
overhauling
said
he
to
himself
of
course
they
will
see
that
gordon
s
bed
is
empty
and
the
next
question
to
be
decided
will
be
who
let
him
out
porter
or
i
i
know
i
didn
t
do
it
porter
will
be
sure
to
deny
can
keep
a
smooth
face
and
tell
a
lie
easier
than
any
boy
ever
unless
i
can
prevail
upon
gordon
to
back
up
my
statement
i
shall
be
in
a
bad
this
was
the
sentry
s
only
chance
for
escape
and
it
looked
like
a
very
slim
one
he
was
not
at
all
acquainted
with
don
gordon
in
fact
he
had
never
exchanged
a
word
with
him
until
that
night
and
consequently
he
had
no
idea
what
don
would
do
when
he
was
taken
before
the
superintendent
and
ordered
to
give
the
names
of
the
and
of
the
outside
sentry
who
had
permitted
him
to
pass
unchallenged
would
he
refuse
to
obey
the
order
as
an
honorable
boy
ought
to
do
or
would
he
seek
to
screen
himself
by
making
a
clean
breast
of
everything
while
the
sentry
was
turning
these
matters
over
in
his
mind
the
officer
of
the
day
opened
the
door
of
don
s
dormitory
it
s
all
over
now
thought
he
and
the
next
thing
is
the
investigation
i
don
t
believe
i
shall
have
another
opportunity
to
speak
to
gordon
for
my
relief
ought
to
be
along
now
but
i
must
see
him
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
and
find
out
what
sort
of
a
story
he
intends
to
tell
when
he
is
hauled
up
if
he
has
nerve
enough
to
keep
a
still
tongue
in
his
the
sentry
brought
his
soliloquy
to
a
close
and
stood
looking
the
very
picture
of
astonishment
just
then
the
officer
of
the
day
and
his
attendant
came
out
of
don
s
room
and
there
was
nothing
in
their
faces
to
indicate
that
they
had
made
any
discovery
there
they
looked
into
all
the
other
dormitories
and
then
came
back
to
the
lower
end
of
the
hall
and
tried
the
door
that
led
to
the
it
was
locked
and
everything
seemed
to
be
all
right
sentry
said
the
officer
of
the
day
in
stern
tones
are
you
sure
you
are
telling
me
the
truth
when
you
say
that
no
one
has
passed
you
yes
sir
i
am
answered
the
boy
looking
his
questioner
squarely
in
the
eye
no
one
has
passed
across
this
floor
since
i
came
on
when
this
matter
has
been
sifted
to
the
bottom
as
it
certainly
will
be
a
fine
reckoning
awaits
somebody
said
the
officer
corporal
we
will
go
to
the
next
when
the
two
had
disappeared
and
the
sentry
s
ears
told
him
that
they
were
making
the
round
of
the
dormitories
above
he
pulled
his
key
from
his
pocket
and
quickly
opened
the
door
behind
which
don
gordon
stood
trying
to
make
up
his
mind
to
something
he
did
not
expect
to
get
into
his
room
that
morning
and
the
question
he
was
trying
to
decide
was
should
he
stay
there
in
the
cold
and
take
his
chances
of
with
the
rest
of
the
plebes
when
they
were
marched
down
to
the
to
answer
to
or
should
he
give
himself
up
and
ask
permission
to
sit
by
the
stove
until
he
was
thawed
out
he
was
very
much
surprised
when
the
door
opened
and
he
saw
the
sentry
beckoning
to
him
gordon
said
the
latter
in
a
hurried
whisper
you
re
safe
did
you
put
a
dummy
in
your
bed
before
you
came
out
don
replied
that
he
did
well
it
must
be
a
perfect
one
for
the
officer
of
the
day
went
in
there
with
a
light
and
never
saw
anything
to
excite
his
suspicions
it
s
the
greatest
wonder
in
the
world
to
me
that
he
didn
t
miss
your
my
clothes
were
there
answered
don
calmly
i
took
my
dress
suit
out
of
the
closet
and
put
it
on
a
chair
by
the
side
of
my
bed
turning
the
coat
inside
out
and
doubling
up
the
skirts
of
it
so
that
it
would
look
like
a
fatigue
coat
what
did
the
old
fellow
have
to
say
about
it
anyhow
the
sentry
could
not
waste
much
time
in
conversation
for
every
moment
was
precious
but
he
said
enough
to
give
don
an
idea
of
what
had
passed
between
himself
and
the
officer
of
the
day
and
to
enable
him
to
give
fisher
and
duncan
a
very
accurate
account
of
it
you
have
got
porter
and
me
and
all
the
rest
of
us
out
of
a
bad
scrape
said
the
sentry
in
conclusion
now
keep
mum
or
if
you
speak
at
all
deny
everything
and
this
night
s
work
will
prove
to
be
the
most
bewildering
piece
of
business
in
the
way
of
that
has
ever
been
done
at
this
academy
go
to
your
room
while
the
way
is
open
to
you
and
be
quick
about
don
whose
teeth
were
chattering
with
the
cold
lost
no
time
in
acting
upon
this
suggestion
his
first
act
was
to
hang
his
in
the
closet
and
his
next
to
deposit
in
its
place
on
the
chair
the
suit
he
had
on
and
which
he
proceeded
to
pull
off
with
all
possible
haste
then
he
tumbled
into
bed
and
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
just
as
the
s
relief
came
up
the
stairs
that
was
another
close
shave
thought
don
and
now
comes
something
else
i
hope
the
investigation
will
not
be
a
very
searching
one
for
if
it
is
the
whole
thing
is
bound
to
come
out
i
am
always
in
for
a
good
time
when
i
can
have
it
without
getting
anybody
into
difficulty
but
when
it
comes
to
telling
a
deliberate
lie
about
s
a
huckleberry
beyond
my
i
say
don
whispered
bert
from
his
bed
great
moses
was
the
culprit
s
mental
ejaculation
was
he
awake
when
i
came
in
if
he
was
i
am
in
for
lectures
by
the
i
say
don
whispered
bert
in
a
louder
tone
m
said
don
drowsily
i
thought
i
heard
some
one
come
in
just
very
likely
you
did
the
officer
of
the
day
has
been
in
the
officer
of
the
day
repeated
bert
who
had
learned
to
dread
that
official
as
much
as
some
of
the
other
boys
disliked
him
what
did
he
want
is
there
anything
wrong
he
wanted
to
make
sure
that
we
were
both
safely
stowed
away
in
our
little
beds
wake
me
when
you
hear
the
morning
this
was
the
substance
of
the
story
that
don
told
his
two
companions
as
they
strolled
about
the
grounds
arm
in
arm
they
listened
in
amazement
and
complimented
don
s
presence
of
mind
in
no
measured
terms
don
said
he
didn
t
look
upon
it
as
much
of
an
almost
any
boy
could
have
done
the
same
thing
under
the
same
circumstances
but
there
are
two
or
three
matters
that
i
want
cleared
up
and
at
least
one
on
which
i
wish
to
come
to
the
plainest
kind
of
an
understanding
with
you
what
made
henderson
halt
me
i
don
t
know
i
am
sure
replied
duncan
he
made
the
biggest
kind
of
a
blunder
didn
t
he
i
ll
tell
you
what
think
about
it
said
tom
dick
probably
knew
that
there
was
somebody
else
watching
you
and
that
if
he
didn
t
challenge
you
he
would
be
reported
for
neglect
of
that
was
the
construction
i
put
upon
his
conduct
said
don
we
can
t
expect
a
fellow
to
get
himself
into
trouble
for
the
sake
of
keeping
another
out
of
it
you
know
chimed
in
clarence
duncan
of
course
not
now
fisher
what
was
the
reason
you
were
not
there
at
that
door
to
let
me
in
i
was
to
blame
for
that
said
clarence
he
knew
don
would
be
sure
to
ask
that
question
and
while
the
latter
was
telling
his
story
he
had
leisure
to
make
up
his
mind
how
he
would
answer
it
when
i
was
running
toward
the
academy
i
heard
footsteps
in
the
and
believing
that
the
relief
was
being
called
i
dodged
behind
the
building
to
wait
until
they
began
the
round
of
the
posts
just
then
henderson
challenged
and
shortly
afterward
some
one
ran
by
me
and
went
into
the
academy
through
the
back
door
i
supposed
it
was
you
and
believing
that
i
was
the
last
one
to
go
in
i
took
pains
to
examine
the
doors
leading
out
of
the
knowing
that
they
would
all
be
tried
by
the
officer
of
the
day
when
he
came
up
to
look
into
the
rooms
in
the
door
opening
on
to
your
floor
i
found
a
key
of
which
i
took
possession
supposing
of
course
that
you
had
used
it
to
let
yourself
in
and
forgotten
to
take
it
away
with
that
was
perfectly
right
gordon
said
tom
fisher
if
the
officer
of
the
day
had
found
that
key
in
the
door
it
would
have
knocked
our
night
excursions
into
a
cocked
hat
the
teachers
don
t
even
suspect
that
we
make
use
of
the
doors
leading
to
the
back
stairs
and
if
they
ever
find
it
then
to
cony
ryan
s
pancakes
said
duncan
finishing
the
sentence
for
his
companion
what
is
that
point
on
which
you
wish
to
come
to
the
plainest
kind
of
an
understanding
with
us
he
added
in
the
hope
of
turning
the
conversation
into
another
channel
he
was
afraid
that
don
might
begin
a
vigorous
and
find
a
flaw
or
two
in
the
story
he
had
told
him
regarding
that
key
it
is
this
replied
don
when
that
whatever
his
name
is
let
me
in
he
told
me
to
keep
mum
or
if
i
opened
my
lips
at
all
to
deny
everything
now
that
is
something
i
ll
not
do
to
please
or
screen
don
s
companions
were
utterly
astounded
they
withdrew
their
arms
from
his
and
stood
off
and
looked
at
him
i
didn
t
think
you
were
that
sort
of
a
chap
said
fisher
neither
did
i
exclaimed
duncan
we
have
been
deceived
in
you
certainly
have
if
you
picked
me
up
for
that
kind
of
a
fellow
answered
don
boldly
and
you
had
better
drop
me
like
a
hot
potato
all
the
secrets
you
have
intrusted
to
my
keeping
are
perfectly
safe
with
me
but
i
want
you
to
understand
that
i
will
not
tell
a
barefaced
lie
if
i
should
chance
to
be
hauled
up
to
keep
you
or
any
one
else
out
of
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
will
confess
if
you
are
hauled
up
demanded
duncan
if
the
superintendent
asks
me
if
i
ran
the
guard
last
night
i
shall
tell
him
the
truth
that
s
what
i
and
give
the
rest
of
us
away
too
exclaimed
fisher
by
no
means
answered
don
quickly
i
didn
t
say
that
if
he
asks
me
any
questions
i
don
t
want
to
answer
i
can
keep
my
mouth
shut
can
t
i
but
will
you
that
s
the
if
you
think
i
can
t
be
trusted
you
had
better
drop
me
was
don
s
reply
it
was
plain
that
tom
and
clarence
were
very
much
disappointed
in
don
and
that
they
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
him
he
had
shown
himself
perfectly
willing
to
break
the
rules
of
the
school
but
his
sense
of
honor
would
not
permit
him
to
lie
about
it
in
order
to
escape
punishment
they
had
never
before
met
a
boy
like
him
i
don
t
believe
such
a
fellow
ever
lived
since
the
days
of
george
washington
thought
duncan
and
neither
do
i
believe
he
means
what
he
says
if
he
is
questioned
he
will
blow
the
whole
thing
and
some
of
us
will
be
sent
down
as
sure
as
the
world
gordon
won
t
do
to
tie
can
see
that
with
half
an
eye
if
you
will
excuse
me
fellows
he
added
aloud
i
will
go
and
ask
dick
henderson
to
give
an
account
of
tom
would
have
been
glad
to
go
with
duncan
for
he
wanted
an
opportunity
to
ask
him
what
he
thought
of
this
boy
who
would
not
tell
a
lie
when
circumstances
seemed
to
demand
it
but
as
he
could
think
up
no
good
excuse
for
leaving
don
just
then
he
remained
with
him
and
duncan
went
off
alone
dick
was
easily
found
for
he
was
loitering
about
waiting
for
a
chance
to
speak
to
duncan
or
fisher
he
expected
that
there
was
trouble
ahead
and
he
wanted
it
distinctly
understood
that
if
it
came
duncan
was
the
boy
who
was
to
blame
for
it
you
re
a
wise
one
you
are
said
he
when
clarence
came
up
to
him
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
some
that
i
don
t
begin
to
understand
you
would
have
got
us
all
into
a
nice
mess
by
your
blundering
you
told
me
to
halt
the
ninth
man
but
it
turned
out
to
be
somebody
besides
don
there
s
where
you
are
mistaken
said
clarence
it
was
gordon
and
nobody
but
he
gave
the
signal
all
fair
and
square
replied
dick
and
i
d
like
to
know
where
he
got
i
am
sure
i
don
t
know
fisher
didn
t
give
it
to
him
in
my
hearing
and
i
didn
t
suppose
he
had
it
i
don
t
know
whether
to
be
glad
or
sorry
that
you
didn
t
succeed
in
stopping
him
he
s
got
a
pocketful
of
money
and
paid
our
bill
at
cony
s
last
night
like
a
gentleman
but
he
s
no
good
and
when
the
boys
hear
what
he
said
to
tom
and
me
just
a
few
minutes
ago
i
don
t
think
they
will
go
on
any
more
excursions
with
him
he
says
that
he
will
not
blow
on
any
of
us
but
if
he
is
accused
of
running
the
guard
he
will
acknowledge
it
because
he
can
t
tell
a
humph
exclaimed
dick
contemptuously
somebody
ought
to
make
him
the
hero
of
a
book
we
don
t
want
anything
more
to
do
with
that
s
what
i
say
now
be
on
your
guard
and
be
careful
how
you
talk
to
but
what
shall
i
say
to
him
if
he
insists
on
knowing
why
i
challenged
him
tell
him
as
fisher
did
that
you
had
to
do
it
in
order
to
protect
yourself
that
the
officer
of
the
day
was
talking
with
post
no
or
something
of
that
greatly
to
the
relief
and
surprise
of
tom
fisher
and
his
party
no
trouble
grew
out
of
that
night
s
work
the
investigation
came
off
that
forenoon
but
the
matter
was
not
sifted
to
the
bottom
as
the
officer
of
the
day
had
declared
it
should
be
for
the
simple
reason
that
it
could
not
be
done
all
the
and
sentries
who
had
been
on
duty
between
the
hours
of
ten
in
the
evening
and
four
in
the
morning
were
subjected
to
a
thorough
examination
but
nothing
was
drawn
from
them
the
innocent
had
nothing
to
tell
and
the
guilty
ones
were
such
adepts
at
lying
that
they
succeeded
in
escaping
punishment
even
if
they
did
not
succeed
in
escaping
suspicion
dick
henderson
said
he
had
tried
to
stop
somebody
who
ran
past
him
but
he
was
quite
positive
that
he
did
not
know
who
he
was
the
officer
of
the
day
and
the
corporal
of
the
guard
were
certain
that
they
had
looked
into
every
room
on
all
the
floors
and
that
every
bed
was
occupied
the
only
conclusion
the
superintendent
could
come
to
was
that
somebody
had
been
outside
the
grounds
after
taps
but
who
he
was
and
how
he
got
out
were
other
and
deeper
questions
he
held
a
council
of
war
with
the
teachers
after
completing
the
examination
of
the
sentries
and
with
them
discussed
various
plans
for
preventing
such
excursions
in
future
or
at
least
making
them
more
difficult
of
accomplishment
one
suggestion
which
he
decided
to
adopt
was
carried
out
that
very
afternoon
of
course
don
and
his
guilty
comrades
were
very
anxious
to
learn
the
result
of
the
investigation
and
when
the
hour
of
recreation
came
they
sent
out
some
of
their
number
to
interview
the
sentries
and
the
reports
these
faithful
scouts
brought
back
were
very
encouraging
the
general
impression
among
the
sentries
who
had
faithfully
performed
their
duty
the
night
before
seemed
to
be
that
although
the
teachers
had
their
suspicions
they
would
not
proceed
any
further
in
the
matter
for
the
simple
reason
that
nothing
could
be
proved
against
anybody
they
were
also
united
in
the
belief
that
in
future
the
buildings
and
grounds
would
be
more
closely
guarded
well
as
soon
as
we
find
out
what
new
precautions
are
to
be
taken
we
can
lay
our
plans
accordingly
said
fisher
to
his
friend
duncan
what
is
it
bub
he
added
turning
to
dick
henderson
who
just
then
hurried
up
with
a
face
full
of
news
come
with
me
and
see
for
yourselves
answered
dick
last
night
s
work
was
an
unlucky
thing
for
us
but
i
am
not
to
blame
for
dick
led
the
way
around
the
academy
building
and
stopped
in
front
of
the
back
door
it
was
open
and
in
the
lower
hall
stood
a
carpenter
who
was
bending
over
a
box
of
tools
fisher
and
duncan
looked
at
dick
but
he
only
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
waved
his
hand
toward
the
man
as
if
to
say
that
if
they
wanted
any
information
they
could
ask
it
of
him
taking
the
hint
tom
inquired
what
are
you
doing
in
there
broken
not
that
i
know
of
replied
the
man
looking
up
to
see
who
it
was
that
addressed
him
i
am
putting
some
new
fastenings
on
these
doors
so
that
you
boys
can
t
slip
out
so
easily
of
nights
i
am
afraid
you
are
getting
to
be
a
bad
very
bad
lot
he
added
with
a
grin
as
he
picked
up
three
or
four
strong
bolts
and
made
his
way
up
the
stairs
clarence
was
thunderstruck
while
tom
was
so
highly
enraged
that
for
a
minute
or
two
he
could
not
trust
himself
to
speak
chapter
ix
don
s
yankee
invention
i
am
not
to
blame
for
it
fellows
repeated
dick
i
did
just
as
i
was
told
to
do
as
nearly
as
i
could
i
know
i
did
not
succeed
in
stopping
don
gordon
and
i
don
t
believe
there
is
a
boy
in
school
who
could
have
stopped
him
but
i
did
my
i
hope
you
see
now
what
you
have
done
by
your
meddling
exclaimed
tom
turning
fiercely
upon
duncan
you
are
not
at
all
to
blame
dick
only
another
time
don
t
take
any
private
orders
from
anybody
we
all
run
the
same
risk
and
we
ought
all
to
have
a
word
to
say
in
regard
to
the
manner
in
which
things
shall
be
if
dick
had
stopped
gordon
as
i
told
him
to
do
this
thing
never
would
have
happened
said
duncan
as
soon
as
he
had
had
time
to
collect
his
wits
there
s
where
i
differ
with
you
answered
tom
the
fact
that
gordon
wasn
t
stopped
does
not
in
the
least
alter
the
case
so
far
as
these
bolts
are
concerned
if
don
had
been
caught
the
bolts
would
have
been
put
on
all
the
same
and
furthermore
you
and
i
and
all
the
rest
of
us
would
have
had
to
stand
a
for
don
would
have
gone
back
on
us
as
sure
as
you
are
a
foot
high
dick
ought
to
have
let
him
and
i
would
too
if
clarence
hadn
t
told
me
to
halt
him
exclaimed
dick
i
know
it
duncan
is
the
one
we
have
to
thank
for
the
loss
of
many
pleasant
evenings
we
might
have
had
this
winter
we
may
as
well
throw
away
our
keys
for
they
will
be
of
no
further
use
to
us
now
that
the
doors
are
to
be
bolted
on
the
i
don
t
know
why
you
should
take
on
so
about
those
bolts
exclaimed
duncan
who
began
to
think
he
had
been
scolded
quite
enough
if
we
wanted
to
go
to
cony
s
what
is
there
to
hinder
one
of
us
from
slipping
up
the
stairs
as
soon
as
this
man
goes
away
and
drawing
the
bolts
don
t
throw
away
your
key
yet
tom
it
may
come
handy
to
fisher
who
was
too
angry
to
reply
turned
on
his
heel
and
walked
away
before
many
hours
had
passed
all
the
boys
belonging
to
the
set
had
heard
about
the
bolts
and
listened
with
no
little
indignation
to
the
story
of
clarence
duncan
s
meddling
except
don
gordon
who
did
not
know
that
he
was
the
victim
of
misplaced
confidence
the
fellows
were
careful
to
keep
that
from
his
ears
for
fear
that
he
and
clarence
would
come
to
blows
over
it
some
of
them
would
have
looked
upon
a
fight
between
these
two
as
an
interesting
spectacle
but
they
knew
that
it
would
be
followed
by
a
court
of
inquiry
during
which
some
things
they
wanted
to
keep
concealed
would
probably
be
brought
to
light
they
had
learned
that
it
was
not
quite
safe
to
trust
their
friend
duncan
too
far
and
as
for
don
he
was
a
stranger
and
there
was
no
telling
how
he
would
act
or
what
he
would
say
when
he
was
told
that
he
could
take
his
choice
between
answering
such
questions
as
were
propounded
to
him
and
being
punished
by
expulsion
from
the
school
that
would
bring
him
to
his
senses
said
tom
to
some
of
his
cronies
who
had
gathered
about
him
to
talk
over
the
situation
he
says
he
wouldn
t
blow
on
us
but
i
don
t
believe
a
word
of
it
there
isn
t
a
boy
in
school
who
can
stand
defiant
in
the
presence
of
the
superintendent
when
he
draws
down
those
gray
eyebrows
of
his
and
looks
at
a
fellow
as
if
he
meant
to
pierce
him
through
hallo
here
comes
henderson
with
more
news
he
s
a
bully
little
scout
even
if
he
did
come
near
getting
us
all
into
trouble
by
halting
don
gordon
what
is
it
this
time
dick
we
may
as
well
follow
your
advice
and
throw
away
our
keys
for
they
are
of
no
use
to
us
now
was
dick
s
reply
the
officer
of
the
day
goes
up
and
tries
those
doors
and
examines
the
new
fastenings
as
regularly
as
he
makes
his
there
exclaimed
tom
in
great
disgust
you
see
what
duncan
has
brought
us
to
by
being
so
smart
no
more
pancakes
for
during
the
next
few
weeks
nothing
happened
at
the
academy
that
is
worthy
of
record
duncan
and
don
gordon
had
rather
a
lonely
time
of
it
for
the
members
of
the
set
were
not
as
cordial
toward
them
as
they
used
to
be
they
did
not
cut
them
entirely
for
they
did
not
think
that
would
be
quite
safe
but
they
did
not
seek
them
out
and
associate
with
them
as
freely
as
they
would
if
they
had
been
on
friendly
terms
duncan
took
it
very
much
to
heart
but
don
did
not
seem
to
care
he
studied
and
drilled
with
the
rest
and
having
served
the
sentence
that
had
been
passed
upon
him
for
overstaying
the
time
for
which
his
leave
of
absence
was
granted
he
began
to
feel
and
act
more
like
himself
so
did
bert
who
soon
began
to
count
his
friends
by
the
score
they
were
true
friends
too
and
very
unlike
the
boys
who
belonged
to
tom
fisher
s
crowd
it
was
not
long
before
the
plebes
began
to
show
the
result
of
their
regular
and
fatiguing
drills
they
became
handy
with
their
muskets
very
proficient
in
company
and
battalion
evolutions
and
finally
they
were
ordered
to
go
on
dress
parade
this
honor
brought
with
it
a
duty
from
which
they
had
thus
far
been
exempt
that
of
standing
guard
up
to
this
time
cony
ryan
had
been
deserted
by
all
except
a
very
few
of
his
old
patrons
who
sometimes
passed
an
hour
or
two
there
of
a
saturday
afternoon
but
they
never
came
away
without
telling
one
another
that
they
had
not
enjoyed
themselves
in
the
their
visits
now
were
not
at
all
like
the
jolly
times
they
used
to
have
when
they
crowded
into
his
little
parlor
after
creeping
by
the
sentries
there
had
been
none
of
that
sort
of
work
of
late
the
sight
of
the
bolts
the
carpenter
had
put
on
the
doors
and
the
increased
vigilance
of
the
officer
of
the
day
had
taken
all
the
courage
out
of
the
bravest
of
them
at
least
so
it
seemed
for
no
one
ever
thought
of
running
the
guard
now
tom
fisher
had
almost
forgotten
that
he
had
ever
done
such
a
thing
when
one
day
he
was
approached
by
don
gordon
who
beckoned
him
off
on
one
side
look
here
old
fellow
said
don
you
ll
dry
up
and
blow
away
if
you
don
t
have
some
excitement
to
put
your
blood
in
circulation
if
you
want
to
go
down
to
cony
s
again
is
your
but
the
bolts
exclaimed
tom
greatly
surprised
the
bolts
won
t
delay
you
five
minutes
replied
don
confidently
i
haven
t
been
idle
during
the
last
few
days
and
i
have
found
a
way
to
draw
those
i
could
do
it
myself
by
going
up
the
back
stairs
said
tom
but
the
officer
of
the
day
would
find
it
out
the
first
time
he
made
his
round
besides
we
want
to
get
in
after
we
have
gone
out
and
how
would
we
throw
those
bolts
back
to
their
place
when
the
door
was
closed
behind
us
have
you
thought
of
that
i
have
but
i
can
show
you
how
it
can
be
done
easier
than
i
can
explain
it
to
you
we
can
t
go
up
to
my
floor
to
operate
for
bert
is
standing
guard
there
who
s
on
your
floor
clarence
are
you
willing
to
trust
him
i
notice
that
you
and
he
are
not
quite
as
thick
as
you
used
to
i
ve
got
to
trust
him
whether
i
am
willing
or
not
if
i
should
go
back
on
him
entirely
he
would
find
a
way
to
get
me
into
a
row
that
would
send
me
i
don
t
see
how
he
could
make
anything
by
that
he
is
as
deep
in
the
mud
as
you
are
and
he
would
probably
be
sent
down
he
wouldn
t
care
for
that
he
ll
go
any
lengths
to
injure
a
boy
he
hates
that
s
his
style
i
have
managed
to
keep
up
a
show
of
friendship
with
him
and
i
know
he
will
let
you
do
anything
you
like
on
his
floor
come
clarence
who
was
seated
in
his
chair
reading
a
sensational
story
paper
that
one
of
the
students
had
smuggled
into
the
academy
nodded
to
tom
returned
don
s
salute
and
would
probably
have
paid
no
further
attention
to
them
had
he
not
seen
them
turn
into
the
hall
that
led
to
the
this
excited
his
curiosity
and
he
arose
and
followed
them
what
are
you
going
to
do
here
he
demanded
gordon
has
discovered
a
way
to
open
these
doors
replied
tom
not
from
this
side
exclaimed
duncan
yes
from
this
side
said
don
i
have
done
it
once
and
i
know
i
can
do
it
duncan
who
believed
that
the
feat
could
not
possibly
be
accomplished
was
unable
to
find
words
with
which
to
express
his
surprise
he
could
only
look
bewildered
he
took
up
a
position
in
the
main
hall
so
that
he
could
watch
the
stairs
and
guard
against
intrusion
and
occasionally
turned
his
eyes
toward
don
whose
proceedings
he
watched
with
the
greatest
interest
don
s
first
act
was
to
produce
his
with
which
he
removed
from
the
lower
corner
of
the
panel
above
the
lock
a
round
plug
of
wood
which
fitted
into
a
hole
about
half
an
inch
in
diameter
the
top
of
the
plug
was
painted
white
like
the
door
and
it
filled
the
opening
so
accurately
that
the
different
officers
of
the
day
who
had
probably
looked
at
it
a
hundred
times
since
it
had
been
placed
there
had
never
seen
it
don
then
pulled
out
of
his
pocket
a
short
crooked
wire
one
end
of
which
was
bent
into
the
form
of
a
hook
and
the
other
made
into
the
shape
of
a
ring
the
hook
he
inserted
into
the
hole
in
the
panel
and
a
moment
later
the
bolt
was
heard
to
slide
from
its
socket
there
you
are
said
he
turning
to
tom
now
take
out
your
key
and
open
the
tom
obeyed
lost
in
wonder
and
then
he
and
duncan
stepped
forward
to
see
how
don
s
invention
worked
simple
as
it
was
it
was
admirably
adapted
to
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
intended
the
only
difficult
thing
about
it
said
don
in
explanation
is
to
get
the
hook
around
the
knob
of
the
bolt
that
done
a
simple
turn
of
the
wrist
does
the
gordon
you
re
a
good
one
exclaimed
tom
you
ought
to
be
a
this
is
a
yankee
least
a
new
england
carpenter
was
the
one
who
brought
it
to
my
notice
answered
don
as
fisher
closed
and
locked
the
door
while
he
was
doing
some
work
on
our
plantation
our
and
were
robbed
more
than
a
dozen
times
it
seemed
impossible
for
father
to
get
locks
that
could
not
be
picked
or
broken
the
carpenter
said
he
could
put
a
stop
to
that
business
and
he
did
it
by
making
some
heavy
wooden
bolts
working
on
the
same
principle
that
this
one
does
only
there
were
three
or
four
knobs
in
them
instead
of
one
then
he
made
a
key
in
shape
something
like
this
one
of
mine
and
when
we
wanted
to
shut
up
for
the
night
all
we
had
to
do
was
to
throw
the
bolts
to
their
places
take
out
the
wire
and
the
doors
were
fast
there
was
but
one
way
to
pass
them
and
that
was
to
break
them
down
and
if
anybody
had
tried
that
he
would
have
got
himself
into
business
directly
for
i
own
some
dogs
that
won
t
permit
any
such
well
i
ve
locked
the
door
said
tom
when
don
ceased
speaking
and
now
i
d
like
to
see
you
throw
that
bolt
back
again
that
s
important
you
don
said
he
knew
it
he
thrust
his
wire
through
the
opening
again
and
in
a
second
more
the
bolt
was
shot
into
its
socket
in
order
to
make
sure
of
it
tom
unlocked
the
door
again
and
tried
to
open
it
but
the
bolt
held
it
fast
don
s
plan
would
work
to
and
duncan
were
sure
of
it
when
did
you
find
opportunity
to
do
all
this
work
asked
the
former
o
i
did
it
at
odd
times
when
i
thought
there
was
the
least
danger
of
being
caught
but
i
tell
you
i
had
a
narrow
escape
once
i
was
working
on
this
very
door
and
tom
you
were
at
the
time
you
see
there
were
a
good
many
days
when
i
couldn
t
do
anything
at
all
on
account
of
the
guards
who
i
knew
were
not
to
be
trusted
well
i
was
working
there
in
the
dark
and
had
just
put
the
plug
into
the
hole
when
the
bell
rang
i
had
been
obliged
to
do
some
whittling
in
order
to
make
the
plug
fit
to
suit
me
but
i
had
been
careful
to
put
all
the
shavings
on
a
piece
of
paper
if
i
had
left
them
on
the
floor
and
anybody
had
come
in
there
with
a
lantern
he
would
have
seen
them
of
course
and
i
should
have
had
my
work
for
nothing
when
i
heard
the
bell
ring
i
grabbed
up
that
piece
of
paper
and
started
for
the
stairs
but
just
then
the
back
door
opened
and
who
should
come
in
but
the
officer
of
the
don
s
auditors
who
were
listening
with
almost
breathless
interest
uttered
ejaculations
indicative
of
the
greatest
surprise
and
sympathy
i
thought
i
was
fairly
cornered
continued
don
and
at
first
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
i
listened
until
i
heard
the
officer
go
into
the
hall
on
the
lower
floor
and
then
i
jerked
off
my
boots
and
went
up
the
next
two
flights
of
stairs
and
up
the
ladder
that
leads
to
the
scuttle
and
there
i
sat
on
one
of
the
topmost
rounds
until
he
tried
all
the
doors
and
went
down
don
you
re
a
good
one
said
fisher
again
but
why
didn
t
you
let
us
know
what
you
were
doing
some
of
us
might
have
helped
well
you
see
i
expected
to
be
caught
and
i
wanted
to
be
able
to
say
that
i
had
received
no
assistance
and
that
nobody
knew
what
i
was
up
to
i
couldn
t
have
told
that
story
if
i
had
taken
you
into
my
confidence
and
i
wouldn
t
we
confess
to
a
great
liking
for
don
gordon
and
to
a
positive
admiration
of
his
moral
as
well
as
physical
courage
but
we
are
not
blind
to
his
failings
we
have
no
patience
with
the
way
he
acted
at
school
after
the
solemn
promises
he
had
made
his
were
all
forgotten
do
we
like
the
way
he
reasoned
with
himself
in
his
opinion
there
were
different
grades
of
lies
for
example
if
the
superintendent
had
asked
him
if
it
were
he
who
had
been
halted
by
dick
henderson
on
a
certain
morning
he
would
have
promptly
replied
that
it
fear
of
punishment
would
not
have
made
him
deny
it
and
yet
when
he
reached
his
room
he
told
bert
a
lie
although
every
word
he
uttered
was
the
truth
by
the
answers
he
gave
to
bert
s
questions
he
led
the
latter
to
infer
that
the
officer
of
the
day
was
the
only
one
who
had
come
into
that
room
and
we
know
that
such
was
not
the
case
don
was
not
altogether
consistent
are
all
the
doors
that
lead
into
the
fixed
in
this
way
asked
tom
no
only
yours
and
mine
there
was
no
need
of
bothering
with
the
other
two
doors
for
the
boys
in
the
first
and
second
classes
don
t
run
with
our
that
s
so
said
duncan
but
i
know
that
some
of
them
go
to
cony
ryan
s
as
regularly
as
we
they
used
to
said
tom
but
i
don
t
think
they
have
been
there
since
these
new
fastenings
were
put
on
what
shall
i
do
with
this
he
added
as
don
passed
the
wire
over
to
him
why
take
it
and
use
then
what
will
you
do
i
have
another
but
i
shall
not
need
it
are
you
not
going
down
to
cony
s
with
us
i
can
t
i
am
to
relieve
henderson
on
post
no
at
midnight
so
you
ll
have
to
go
out
and
come
in
by
dick
and
that
night
everything
passed
off
smoothly
the
guards
who
held
the
floor
when
tom
and
a
chosen
few
went
out
and
in
were
accommodating
the
bolt
was
easily
worked
by
the
aid
of
the
wire
don
had
fashioned
the
sentries
on
post
no
kept
themselves
out
of
sight
the
pancakes
and
syrup
were
excellent
the
night
was
passed
in
a
most
agreeable
manner
and
at
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
the
were
all
sleeping
soundly
in
their
beds
and
no
one
was
the
wiser
for
what
they
had
done
they
missed
don
especially
tom
fisher
who
had
to
pay
his
share
of
the
bill
from
a
very
slender
purse
whom
they
as
well
as
cony
ryan
declared
to
be
an
honor
to
his
class
it
begins
to
look
as
though
the
old
times
were
coming
back
again
said
cony
as
he
sat
by
and
saw
his
pancakes
disappear
before
the
attacks
of
his
visitors
who
ate
as
though
they
never
had
anything
good
served
up
to
them
at
the
academy
i
tell
you
the
boys
who
went
to
school
here
years
ago
some
of
whom
are
now
men
with
boys
of
their
own
to
look
after
were
a
sharp
lot
you
couldn
t
keep
them
in
if
they
didn
t
want
to
stay
and
there
was
no
use
in
trying
of
late
you
fellows
haven
t
done
anything
to
be
proud
of
but
perhaps
this
young
gordon
will
put
some
life
into
and
he
certainly
did
in
which
don
took
an
active
part
became
of
common
occurrence
although
the
teachers
never
suspected
it
and
cony
ryan
slapped
his
pockets
and
blessed
the
day
that
brought
don
gordon
to
the
bridgeport
academy
but
the
reckoning
came
at
last
though
long
delayed
and
don
aided
by
an
unexpected
proceeding
on
the
part
of
tom
fisher
did
something
that
raised
him
to
a
high
place
in
the
estimation
of
all
the
students
and
knocked
the
set
so
high
that
it
never
came
down
again
at
least
it
was
never
heard
of
afterward
it
came
about
in
this
way
winter
had
passed
the
snow
had
disappeared
the
ice
was
all
out
of
the
river
the
buds
were
starting
on
the
maple
trees
and
those
of
the
students
who
were
ambitious
to
be
something
better
than
privates
in
their
companies
were
studying
night
and
day
to
prepare
themselves
for
the
approaching
examination
these
found
rest
and
recreation
by
whipping
the
neighboring
brooks
for
trout
on
saturday
afternoon
you
know
it
is
time
to
begin
when
the
maple
buds
start
while
tom
fisher
and
his
followers
diverted
themselves
by
running
the
guard
as
often
as
the
opportunity
was
presented
on
a
certain
night
one
of
tom
s
friends
who
held
one
of
the
outside
posts
from
eight
o
clock
until
midnight
was
taken
suddenly
ill
and
was
relieved
by
the
corporal
his
beat
being
taken
by
a
boy
who
did
not
belong
to
the
tom
had
made
arrangements
for
visiting
cony
ryan
s
and
don
gordon
had
charge
of
his
floor
when
taps
had
sounded
and
the
officer
of
the
day
had
made
his
rounds
the
left
their
dormitories
one
by
one
don
turning
his
back
so
that
he
did
not
see
them
as
they
passed
they
left
the
building
without
being
discovered
but
when
they
attempted
to
pass
the
sentry
their
troubles
began
they
were
halted
and
by
a
voice
that
did
not
belong
to
the
friend
they
had
expected
to
find
on
that
post
amazed
and
disconcerted
they
huddled
together
for
a
moment
like
a
flock
of
sheep
that
had
been
suddenly
frightened
and
then
knowing
that
there
was
but
one
thing
they
could
do
they
turned
and
started
for
the
academy
on
a
dead
run
the
vigilant
sentry
all
the
while
rending
the
air
with
his
lusty
calls
for
the
corporal
of
the
guard
they
tumbled
up
the
stairs
gained
access
to
the
floor
on
which
their
dormitories
were
situated
pulled
off
their
uniforms
without
loss
of
time
and
went
to
bed
as
miserable
and
frightened
a
lot
of
boys
as
the
walls
of
that
academy
had
ever
inclosed
did
you
ever
hear
of
anything
so
very
unfortunate
whispered
fisher
to
his
friend
duncan
if
there
was
any
one
of
our
fellows
except
gordon
in
charge
of
this
floor
we
should
be
all
right
for
it
is
as
dark
as
a
pocket
out
of
doors
and
i
know
that
that
sentry
could
not
have
recognized
we
ought
never
to
have
had
anything
to
do
with
gordon
in
the
first
place
whispered
duncan
in
reply
that
s
what
i
have
thought
for
a
long
time
but
it
is
too
late
to
mend
the
matter
now
there
they
are
he
added
as
the
sound
of
footsteps
on
the
stairs
came
to
their
ears
it
is
all
over
with
us
so
thought
don
gordon
only
he
used
the
word
me
instead
of
i
am
in
for
it
he
soliloquized
and
i
would
give
something
to
know
what
they
will
do
with
me
i
ll
not
go
back
on
the
boys
and
that
s
flat
the
superintendent
will
give
me
a
lively
of
course
and
then
what
will
bert
say
what
will
mother
think
when
the
officer
of
the
day
attended
as
usual
by
the
corporal
came
up
the
stairs
he
found
don
pacing
slowly
along
the
hall
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
they
returned
his
salute
but
did
not
speak
to
him
they
went
to
the
upper
end
of
the
hall
and
began
a
thorough
examination
of
all
the
rooms
the
officer
of
the
day
arousing
the
occupant
of
every
bed
while
the
corporal
held
his
lantern
aloft
so
that
the
face
of
each
one
could
be
plainly
seen
don
s
dummy
would
not
have
saved
him
this
time
when
they
had
satisfied
themselves
that
no
one
on
that
floor
was
missing
and
had
tried
the
door
opening
into
the
hall
that
led
to
the
they
went
up
the
stairs
to
look
into
the
dormitories
on
the
floors
above
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
they
went
back
to
the
and
don
was
left
alone
scarcely
had
the
sound
of
their
footsteps
died
away
in
the
lower
hall
when
a
dozen
doors
were
softly
opened
and
almost
twice
as
many
heads
were
thrust
cautiously
out
what
s
the
row
gordon
was
the
whispered
chorus
that
saluted
don
s
ears
what
did
the
officer
of
the
day
wake
us
up
for
anybody
out
there
s
no
one
out
who
belongs
on
this
floor
replied
don
and
if
there
has
been
anything
going
on
up
stairs
i
don
t
know
what
did
he
say
to
you
not
a
word
the
students
were
all
surprised
to
hear
this
and
there
were
some
among
them
who
were
frightened
as
well
after
a
few
more
questions
which
brought
no
information
from
don
for
the
simple
reason
that
he
had
none
to
impart
the
students
all
went
back
to
bed
except
fisher
and
duncan
who
lingered
to
have
a
word
with
don
in
private
they
were
ill
at
ease
and
told
themselves
that
when
the
new
fastenings
were
put
on
the
doors
some
new
routine
had
been
adopted
of
which
they
had
not
yet
heard
didn
t
he
ask
you
any
questions
at
a
single
one
whispered
fisher
he
didn
t
open
his
lips
answered
don
didn
t
say
anything
to
you
about
reporting
to
him
as
soon
as
you
were
relieved
did
he
put
in
duncan
who
thought
don
must
surely
be
mistaken
how
could
he
when
he
didn
t
open
his
lips
asked
don
in
reply
this
is
an
unusual
way
of
doing
business
said
tom
reflectively
and
there
s
something
about
it
that
doesn
t
look
just
right
to
me
now
mark
my
words
fellows
they
re
going
to
spring
something
new
on
us
and
they
will
do
it
so
suddenly
that
it
will
knock
us
flatter
than
one
of
cony
ryan
s
pancakes
you
ll
and
sure
enough
they
did
chapter
x
breaking
up
the
it
was
an
eager
and
anxious
lot
of
boys
who
answered
to
the
next
morning
of
course
they
knew
that
a
party
of
their
fellows
had
been
challenged
while
they
were
attempting
to
run
the
guard
and
they
were
impatient
to
learn
who
they
were
and
what
the
superintendent
was
going
to
do
about
it
two
things
astonished
and
bewildered
them
they
could
not
imagine
how
the
culprits
had
managed
to
leave
the
building
and
get
back
again
so
easily
and
neither
could
they
understand
why
the
officer
of
the
day
had
neglected
to
question
the
they
believed
with
tom
fisher
that
something
new
was
to
be
sprung
on
them
and
as
soon
as
breakfast
was
over
they
found
out
what
it
was
on
ordinary
occasions
the
marched
their
respective
companies
to
and
from
the
but
on
this
particular
morning
the
captains
took
command
and
led
them
to
the
where
they
were
drawn
up
in
line
as
they
were
when
preparing
for
the
teachers
were
all
there
and
many
a
sly
and
inquiring
glance
was
cast
toward
them
but
their
countenances
revealed
nothing
right
dress
commanded
the
captains
as
the
companies
came
into
line
and
when
these
orders
had
been
obeyed
the
superintendent
who
stood
in
the
place
that
is
occupied
by
the
battalion
commander
during
thus
addressed
them
young
gentlemen
said
he
and
his
tones
were
not
near
as
stern
and
severe
as
the
boys
expected
they
would
be
i
am
sorry
to
hear
that
some
of
you
attempted
to
run
the
guard
last
night
heretofore
when
such
offences
have
been
committed
it
has
been
our
rule
to
examine
the
and
sentries
who
were
on
duty
at
the
time
but
we
have
seldom
succeeded
in
drawing
from
them
any
information
that
would
lead
to
the
detection
of
the
guilty
parties
a
student
who
will
prove
false
to
his
duty
and
violate
the
confidence
reposed
in
him
will
not
scruple
to
tell
any
number
of
falsehoods
to
conceal
his
now
i
intend
before
these
ranks
are
broken
to
learn
the
names
of
all
those
who
tried
to
run
by
post
no
last
night
as
well
as
the
name
of
the
who
permitted
them
to
pass
the
first
sergeants
will
now
call
the
roll
and
you
can
answer
guilty
or
not
guilty
just
as
your
sense
of
honor
may
seem
to
dictate
if
innocent
simply
answer
here
and
keep
your
place
in
the
ranks
if
you
are
guilty
step
three
paces
to
the
front
i
put
you
all
upon
your
when
the
superintendent
ceased
speaking
the
first
sergeants
moved
to
the
front
and
centre
of
their
respective
companies
and
the
began
as
it
proceeded
more
than
one
boy
standing
in
the
ranks
of
the
third
company
tried
to
twist
himself
around
so
that
he
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
don
gordon
s
face
hoping
to
see
something
there
that
would
give
him
a
hint
of
the
course
don
intended
to
pursue
when
his
turn
came
to
answer
to
his
name
he
certainly
will
dare
were
the
thoughts
that
passed
through
their
minds
if
he
does
he
will
be
sent
down
sure
if
some
one
could
only
get
a
chance
to
whisper
a
word
or
two
in
his
ear
we
would
come
out
all
right
yet
in
spite
of
this
honor
the
anxiety
and
alarm
experienced
by
these
boys
showed
very
plainly
in
their
countenances
and
before
the
had
been
going
on
for
two
minutes
the
superintendent
could
have
stepped
forward
and
picked
out
every
one
of
the
the
names
of
the
boys
belonging
to
the
first
and
second
companies
were
called
in
quick
succession
and
as
yet
nobody
had
stepped
to
the
front
the
culprits
in
this
instance
all
belonged
to
the
third
class
with
the
single
exception
of
don
gordon
who
having
long
ago
made
up
his
mind
what
he
would
do
waited
with
some
impatience
to
see
how
his
companions
in
guilt
would
stand
the
test
the
result
was
just
what
he
might
have
expected
clarence
duncan
said
the
third
company
sergeant
here
answered
the
owner
of
that
name
making
a
desperate
but
unsuccessful
effort
to
appear
at
his
ease
george
richard
thomas
they
re
a
pack
of
cowards
was
don
s
mental
comment
such
fellows
always
are
and
i
ought
to
have
known
better
than
to
take
up
with
them
my
last
act
in
this
school
will
be
to
show
them
and
everybody
else
that
i
am
just
as
willing
to
pay
the
fiddler
as
i
am
to
at
last
the
sergeant
of
the
fourth
company
began
and
near
the
top
of
his
list
was
the
donald
there
was
no
response
to
it
but
to
the
intense
amazement
of
everybody
present
and
the
almost
overwhelming
consternation
of
some
don
stepped
quickly
and
firmly
to
the
front
no
one
outside
the
set
would
have
thought
of
picking
him
out
as
a
the
sergeant
hesitated
and
stammered
over
the
next
name
and
there
was
a
perceptible
flutter
among
all
except
the
boys
they
showed
their
three
years
drill
and
discipline
by
standing
as
stiff
as
so
many
posts
and
holding
their
eyes
straight
to
the
front
but
they
could
not
control
their
countenances
and
surprise
and
sorrow
were
depicted
upon
every
one
of
them
when
the
was
ended
the
sergeants
went
back
to
their
places
and
don
was
left
standing
alone
he
had
passed
through
one
ordeal
and
now
came
another
gordon
said
the
superintendent
i
am
glad
to
see
that
you
have
too
much
manhood
to
take
refuge
behind
a
lie
i
should
have
been
very
much
surprised
and
grieved
if
you
had
showed
me
that
i
had
formed
a
wrong
opinion
of
these
words
made
some
of
the
guilty
ones
in
the
third
class
open
their
eyes
duncan
s
face
grew
whiter
than
ever
while
tom
fisher
said
to
himself
i
really
believe
the
old
fellow
knows
right
where
to
look
to
find
every
boy
who
was
outside
the
building
last
night
after
taps
if
i
had
had
the
faintest
suspicion
that
don
intended
to
confess
i
should
have
been
ahead
of
him
he
ll
get
off
easy
by
giving
the
names
of
the
rest
of
us
and
duncan
and
i
and
a
few
others
who
kicked
up
such
a
row
last
term
will
be
sent
you
had
charge
of
the
third
floor
between
the
hours
of
eight
and
twelve
last
evening
continued
the
superintendent
addressing
himself
to
don
yes
sir
was
the
reply
and
while
you
were
on
duty
several
boys
who
you
knew
intended
to
run
the
guard
left
their
dormitories
and
you
permitted
them
to
pass
out
of
the
building
yes
sir
said
don
again
give
me
the
names
of
those
boys
said
the
superintendent
nodding
to
the
adjutant
who
pulled
out
his
and
pencil
but
he
did
not
use
least
just
then
while
he
held
his
pencil
in
the
air
and
looked
at
don
and
the
culprits
were
trembling
with
apprehension
and
the
others
were
listening
with
all
their
ears
to
catch
the
first
name
that
fell
from
don
s
lips
the
answer
came
clear
and
distinct
i
hope
you
will
not
insist
upon
that
sir
for
it
is
something
i
do
not
like
to
the
superintendent
stared
the
teachers
looked
astonished
and
another
flutter
of
excitement
ran
along
the
line
this
time
it
did
not
even
miss
the
boys
some
of
whom
so
far
forgot
themselves
as
to
turn
their
heads
and
look
at
the
boy
who
dared
stand
in
the
presence
of
the
head
of
the
school
and
say
that
he
did
not
like
to
obey
an
order
that
had
been
given
him
such
a
thing
had
never
happened
before
in
the
bridgeport
academy
don
s
companions
in
guilt
began
to
breathe
easier
if
he
will
only
stick
to
that
am
all
right
but
will
have
to
go
down
soliloquized
clarence
duncan
whose
every
thought
was
a
selfish
one
and
who
did
not
care
the
snap
of
his
finger
what
became
of
don
or
anybody
else
so
long
as
he
escaped
punishment
himself
that
bangs
me
thought
tom
fisher
who
was
not
altogether
bad
at
heart
even
though
he
did
have
faults
almost
without
number
he
knew
a
brave
boy
when
he
saw
one
and
don
s
conduct
excited
his
unbounded
admiration
he
s
the
pluckiest
fellow
i
ever
saw
and
he
shall
not
be
sent
down
if
i
can
help
do
you
refuse
to
give
me
the
names
of
those
boys
asked
the
superintendent
as
soon
as
he
had
somewhat
recovered
from
his
surprise
i
would
rather
not
sir
replied
don
he
did
not
like
to
use
so
strong
a
word
as
refuse
but
still
his
answer
was
given
in
a
tone
which
showed
that
he
had
no
intention
of
wavering
you
know
the
alternative
said
the
superintendent
quietly
but
firmly
yes
and
you
are
willing
to
submit
to
it
yes
sir
but
i
am
not
willing
that
he
should
sir
exclaimed
tom
fisher
stepping
three
paces
to
the
front
and
raising
his
hand
to
his
cap
if
he
won
t
tell
who
the
are
i
attention
shouted
the
superintendent
who
was
utterly
confounded
by
this
breach
of
discipline
but
tom
having
made
a
resolution
was
determined
to
stick
to
it
regardless
of
the
consequences
no
boy
in
this
academy
shall
ever
again
suffer
for
my
misdeeds
if
i
can
help
it
said
he
speaking
as
rapidly
as
he
could
in
order
that
he
might
get
everything
off
his
mind
before
he
was
interrupted
i
was
one
of
the
and
if
the
others
have
the
least
particle
of
pluck
in
shouted
the
superintendent
again
captain
morgan
he
added
addressing
the
commander
of
the
first
company
detail
a
corporal
s
guard
to
take
private
fisher
to
his
room
under
i
don
t
care
thought
tom
as
he
was
marched
off
by
the
guard
that
was
quickly
detailed
to
take
charge
of
him
i
did
my
best
to
save
don
and
i
shall
go
down
with
something
like
a
clear
conscience
but
i
really
wish
the
superintendent
would
give
me
another
chance
i
would
make
an
honest
and
earnest
effort
to
do
this
was
the
unexpected
act
on
the
part
of
tom
fisher
to
which
we
referred
a
short
time
ago
and
which
taken
in
connection
with
don
s
bold
acknowledgment
of
his
guilt
did
more
to
break
up
at
that
academy
than
all
the
locks
and
bolts
that
could
have
been
put
upon
the
doors
these
two
incidents
upset
everybody
teachers
included
but
the
latter
were
quick
to
see
how
to
take
advantage
of
it
sergeant
clayton
call
the
roll
of
your
company
again
said
the
superintendent
the
sergeant
obeyed
and
this
time
all
the
stepped
to
the
front
with
the
exception
of
clarence
duncan
he
had
good
reasons
for
fearing
exposure
as
we
shall
presently
see
and
believing
that
his
companions
would
follow
don
gordon
s
example
and
refuse
to
bear
witness
against
him
he
was
resolved
to
keep
up
a
bold
front
and
to
deny
his
guilt
to
the
very
last
it
is
a
pity
that
some
of
these
fellows
didn
t
come
to
the
same
determination
said
he
to
himself
there
was
not
a
scrap
of
evidence
against
any
of
us
and
if
they
had
only
stood
by
sergeant
call
private
duncan
s
name
again
said
the
superintendent
breaking
in
upon
his
soliloquy
clarence
duncan
said
the
sergeant
here
came
the
response
duncan
repeated
clayton
replied
the
culprit
adding
to
himself
you
can
t
make
me
own
up
and
you
might
as
well
give
up
private
duncan
three
paces
to
the
front
commanded
the
superintendent
break
duncan
was
taken
to
his
room
under
guard
and
when
he
got
there
he
found
an
armed
sentry
pacing
back
and
forth
in
front
of
the
door
tom
fisher
was
seated
at
the
table
with
an
open
book
before
him
but
he
was
not
studying
he
was
thinking
over
the
incidents
that
had
just
transpired
well
clarence
said
he
cheerfully
we
re
in
for
yes
replied
clarence
angrily
thanks
to
you
and
don
gordon
we
are
in
for
it
i
never
knew
before
that
you
were
such
a
coward
what
made
you
side
with
gordon
well
i
had
two
reasons
for
it
in
the
first
place
he
showed
himself
to
be
a
good
fellow
and
as
true
as
steel
and
i
couldn
t
stand
by
and
see
him
punished
if
i
hadn
t
spoken
up
he
would
have
been
sent
down
for
refusing
to
give
our
that
s
just
what
ought
to
have
been
done
with
him
said
clarence
as
the
case
now
stands
continued
tom
he
will
most
likely
be
let
off
easy
this
being
the
first
time
that
anything
serious
has
been
charged
against
and
what
is
to
become
of
you
and
me
you
know
what
they
told
us
the
last
time
we
were
don
t
you
i
should
think
i
ought
for
i
have
been
reminded
of
it
often
enough
don
t
you
know
that
by
befriending
don
you
have
got
me
into
a
terrible
scrape
don
t
you
remember
that
my
father
told
me
that
he
would
put
me
on
board
the
if
i
were
sent
down
it
would
have
been
strange
if
tom
had
forgotten
it
for
duncan
had
such
a
horror
of
that
same
that
he
talked
about
it
every
day
he
had
seen
and
conversed
with
boys
who
had
been
sent
there
because
they
would
not
behave
themselves
at
home
and
he
had
noticed
that
they
all
agreed
on
these
two
the
officers
were
very
stern
and
severe
and
that
the
life
of
a
was
easier
and
more
respectable
than
that
of
a
foremast
hand
clarence
had
a
horror
of
the
sea
and
every
thing
connected
with
it
and
he
looked
forward
to
five
years
on
the
with
feelings
very
near
akin
to
those
with
which
he
would
have
looked
forward
to
a
term
in
the
penitentiary
you
went
back
on
me
an
friend
for
the
sake
of
a
boy
you
never
saw
or
heard
of
until
last
winter
continued
clarence
i
didn
t
act
the
craven
i
tell
you
i
stuck
it
out
as
long
as
i
did
they
find
you
out
asked
tom
i
am
under
arrest
the
same
as
you
are
but
they
can
t
prove
anything
against
then
how
does
it
come
that
you
are
in
arrest
that
s
just
what
beats
me
they
called
the
roll
of
our
company
again
after
you
were
sent
off
under
guard
and
to
my
intense
disgust
every
fellow
who
was
with
us
last
night
stepped
to
the
front
they
tried
to
bully
a
confession
out
of
me
but
i
didn
t
leave
the
ranks
until
i
was
ordered
to
do
that
brings
me
to
the
second
reason
i
had
for
doing
as
i
did
said
tom
they
ve
got
evidence
against
every
one
of
i
don
t
see
where
they
got
if
clarence
had
taken
the
trouble
to
look
in
the
mirror
he
would
have
seen
at
a
glance
where
the
evidence
that
convicted
him
came
from
he
carried
it
in
his
face
we
need
not
dwell
upon
the
incidents
that
happened
during
the
next
few
days
for
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
our
story
and
no
one
except
the
boys
who
attended
the
bridgeport
academy
at
this
particular
time
would
be
interested
in
them
it
will
be
enough
to
say
that
the
culprits
were
confined
to
their
rooms
and
given
ample
leisure
in
which
to
think
over
their
folly
and
make
good
resolutions
for
the
future
the
repentant
ones
devoted
the
most
of
their
time
to
their
books
but
there
were
some
among
them
who
did
nothing
but
bemoan
their
hard
luck
and
rail
at
don
gordon
for
being
such
a
the
came
off
in
due
time
and
clarence
duncan
who
denied
his
guilt
to
the
very
last
and
even
denounced
the
others
for
bearing
false
witness
against
him
was
sent
down
and
it
was
not
long
before
reports
came
to
the
academy
that
he
had
been
placed
on
board
the
tom
fisher
was
given
a
new
lease
of
life
he
evidently
knew
just
what
he
was
doing
when
he
took
sides
with
don
for
that
one
act
was
all
that
saved
him
from
going
home
too
next
to
duncan
he
and
don
received
the
heaviest
sentences
both
being
gated
for
two
months
during
which
time
they
were
required
to
walk
eight
extras
with
packed
knapsacks
on
their
backs
the
others
were
punished
in
nearly
the
same
way
only
they
were
not
gated
for
so
long
a
period
nor
were
they
called
upon
to
perform
as
much
extra
duty
strange
as
it
may
appear
no
one
suspected
that
the
had
made
use
of
the
all
the
blame
was
laid
upon
the
who
suffered
accordingly
these
stirring
events
as
we
said
before
broke
up
the
set
completely
and
made
fast
friends
of
don
gordon
and
tom
fisher
who
holding
firmly
to
their
determination
to
do
better
gradually
broke
off
their
intimate
relations
with
the
lazy
mischievous
and
discontented
members
of
their
classes
and
began
to
have
more
to
do
with
fellows
who
were
worth
knowing
the
manly
stand
they
had
taken
during
the
investigation
it
was
a
manly
act
on
don
s
part
but
largely
prudential
on
the
part
of
tom
fisher
excited
the
wonder
and
admiration
of
all
the
students
and
the
boys
in
the
upper
classes
who
had
never
taken
any
notice
of
them
except
to
return
their
salutes
now
sought
them
out
and
became
intimate
with
them
it
was
certainly
a
great
relief
to
don
to
associate
with
fellows
who
were
not
all
the
while
grumbling
about
something
or
discussing
plans
for
getting
by
the
guard
one
day
he
was
surprised
by
a
visit
from
egan
the
first
sergeant
of
his
company
who
entered
his
room
holding
an
open
letter
in
his
hand
say
gordon
he
exclaimed
taking
no
notice
of
don
s
salute
why
didn
t
you
let
the
fellows
know
that
your
father
used
to
go
to
this
school
some
of
them
do
know
it
replied
don
well
i
didn
t
know
it
until
i
received
this
letter
said
the
sergeant
helping
himself
to
a
chair
and
throwing
his
cap
on
bert
s
bed
i
spoke
of
you
in
a
letter
i
wrote
home
a
short
time
ago
and
am
surprised
to
learn
that
your
father
and
mine
used
to
be
and
chums
when
they
belonged
to
this
academy
let
s
don
took
the
sergeant
s
proffered
hand
and
this
was
the
beginning
of
another
friendship
that
has
never
been
broken
the
sergeant
was
just
the
kind
of
associate
that
don
needed
he
was
a
faithful
soldier
a
close
student
a
favorite
with
both
teachers
and
scholars
and
his
example
and
influence
did
wonders
for
don
gordon
it
is
true
that
during
his
first
year
at
the
academy
he
had
been
rather
restive
under
the
strict
discipline
to
which
he
was
subjected
he
had
even
run
the
he
hadn
t
he
would
not
have
known
as
much
as
he
did
about
cony
ryan
s
pancakes
and
maple
he
had
paid
for
his
fun
by
walking
extras
and
being
gated
but
that
was
all
over
now
and
he
was
one
of
the
last
boys
in
school
who
would
have
been
suspected
of
any
violation
of
the
rules
egan
introduced
his
new
friend
to
the
fellows
in
the
first
class
and
fellows
don
found
them
to
be
some
of
them
were
fond
of
shooting
and
fishing
knew
a
good
dog
and
gun
when
they
saw
them
and
could
tell
hunting
stories
without
number
others
among
they
were
southern
boys
like
more
of
their
horses
than
they
did
of
almost
anything
else
they
were
at
home
in
the
saddle
and
delighted
to
talk
of
the
fine
times
they
had
enjoyed
while
riding
to
the
hounds
courtland
hopkins
who
was
the
falstaff
of
the
academy
always
grew
enthusiastic
when
the
subject
of
was
introduced
ah
gordon
he
said
one
day
that
is
the
sport
come
down
into
maryland
with
me
next
vacation
and
i
ll
show
you
some
fun
a
lot
of
the
fellows
have
been
promising
to
go
for
a
long
time
but
that
s
all
it
has
amounted
i
d
like
to
see
you
in
the
saddle
hop
said
egan
taking
his
friend
by
the
arm
and
turning
him
around
so
that
he
could
give
him
a
good
looking
over
you
ve
almost
too
much
avoirdupois
for
a
rider
according
to
my
way
of
thinking
in
other
words
you
re
a
great
deal
too
just
give
me
a
good
horse
and
see
if
i
can
t
take
a
fence
as
cleverly
as
anybody
returned
hopkins
quickly
i
am
good
for
a
plate
of
soup
at
the
international
if
there
is
a
colt
in
bridgeport
that
can
throw
if
you
will
all
go
home
with
i
will
give
you
some
of
the
best
you
ever
saw
said
don
yes
but
that
would
require
a
and
that
is
something
i
never
did
like
said
walter
curtis
if
you
want
to
see
fun
combined
with
skill
take
a
thanksgiving
dinner
with
me
and
watch
the
members
of
our
club
break
glass
balls
with
these
words
were
spoken
carelessly
but
they
were
not
forgotten
if
they
had
been
this
series
of
books
would
never
have
been
written
chapter
xi
the
students
in
camp
time
flew
on
the
school
term
drew
to
a
close
and
at
last
the
day
of
all
days
day
to
which
all
the
students
in
the
bridgeport
military
academy
looked
forward
with
the
liveliest
anticipations
of
of
late
there
had
been
a
perceptible
bustle
among
the
boys
those
of
their
number
who
had
hitherto
thought
of
nothing
but
mischief
and
whose
highest
ambition
was
to
shirk
their
duty
in
every
way
they
could
began
to
show
some
interest
in
the
daily
school
routine
and
tried
by
the
hardest
kind
of
study
and
strict
attention
to
business
to
make
up
for
the
time
they
had
lost
there
was
no
idleness
and
consequently
no
rules
were
broken
and
there
was
no
extra
duty
to
be
done
there
was
less
time
wasted
in
loitering
about
the
grounds
the
hours
of
recreation
being
devoted
to
the
discussion
of
various
plans
for
amusement
and
to
the
overhauling
of
and
their
studies
were
soon
to
be
thrown
aside
for
a
whole
month
their
pleasant
dormitories
were
to
be
exchanged
for
oars
and
geologists
hammers
were
to
take
the
place
of
the
pens
pencils
and
mathematical
instruments
that
had
so
long
been
their
daily
companions
and
their
tiresome
drills
were
to
give
way
to
moonlight
and
to
some
other
sports
that
would
not
have
been
permitted
while
the
students
were
living
at
the
academy
but
which
were
winked
at
during
the
time
they
were
in
camp
what
these
sports
were
shall
be
told
presently
as
the
eventful
day
drew
near
the
excitement
and
impatience
and
we
may
add
anxiety
of
the
students
increased
to
such
a
degree
that
it
was
all
they
could
do
to
study
the
reason
for
this
state
of
affairs
was
found
in
the
fact
that
it
had
somehow
leaked
what
source
no
one
seemed
able
to
an
event
of
unusual
interest
was
to
take
place
during
this
particular
encampment
something
that
had
never
occurred
before
and
might
never
occur
again
some
of
the
boys
who
were
in
the
secret
had
said
just
enough
to
put
their
companions
on
nettles
but
not
enough
to
give
them
even
the
faintest
idea
of
what
they
might
expect
i
know
that
and
trolling
for
pickerel
and
spearing
eels
by
are
fine
sports
egan
said
to
don
one
day
and
they
are
exciting
too
when
you
have
no
better
way
of
passing
the
time
but
you
very
soon
forget
all
about
the
pleasure
you
have
in
that
way
don
t
you
well
there
s
something
going
to
happen
very
shortly
that
you
ll
not
forget
so
easily
tell
you
you
will
remember
it
as
long
as
you
now
sergeant
what
is
it
exclaimed
don
after
egan
had
talked
to
him
a
few
times
in
this
way
can
t
you
give
me
a
hint
no
couldn
t
possibly
think
of
well
then
if
you
were
told
to
keep
it
to
yourself
why
don
t
you
do
it
what
s
the
use
of
aggravating
a
fellow
in
this
way
i
assure
you
my
dear
boy
that
no
aggravation
is
intended
replied
egan
in
his
blandest
tones
i
only
meant
to
prepare
you
for
something
you
never
dreamed
of
if
your
eyes
don
t
open
and
your
hair
stand
on
end
i
can
t
think
of
it
without
a
little
thrill
of
meanwhile
the
question
as
to
where
and
how
the
coming
vacation
should
be
spent
had
been
repeatedly
referred
to
and
talked
over
by
don
and
his
three
friends
in
the
first
hopkins
and
curtis
the
latter
was
anxious
to
go
home
and
join
his
friends
in
the
that
always
came
off
on
thanksgiving
day
hopkins
wanted
don
to
see
him
add
another
brush
to
the
numerous
trophies
of
the
chase
that
adorned
the
walls
of
his
room
and
don
held
out
strongly
in
favor
of
his
own
about
diamond
lake
the
matter
was
finally
settled
by
the
assistance
of
general
gordon
who
sent
each
of
the
boys
a
cordial
invitation
to
spend
at
least
a
small
portion
of
their
next
vacation
at
don
s
and
made
sure
of
its
acceptance
by
communicating
with
the
fathers
of
these
students
all
of
whom
he
had
known
in
the
days
of
his
boyhood
this
point
having
been
decided
to
his
entire
satisfaction
don
could
have
settled
down
to
good
hard
work
had
it
not
been
for
the
fact
that
he
was
continually
looking
forward
to
that
unusual
and
interesting
event
that
was
to
transpire
when
the
boys
went
into
camp
his
curiosity
had
been
aroused
to
the
highest
pitch
and
he
could
scarcely
think
about
anything
else
the
sun
rose
clear
and
cloudless
on
the
morning
of
the
first
day
of
august
and
before
the
echoes
awakened
by
the
roar
of
the
had
fairly
died
away
the
boys
were
crowding
into
the
breakfast
was
served
immediately
after
and
two
hours
later
three
hundred
students
led
by
the
band
and
marching
with
the
precision
of
veteran
soldiers
moved
through
the
wide
gateway
and
down
the
principal
street
of
the
village
toward
their
everybody
turned
out
to
see
them
flags
and
handkerchiefs
were
waved
all
along
their
line
of
march
flowers
were
showered
into
their
ranks
and
when
in
obedience
to
the
command
platoons
right
front
into
line
double
time
march
they
broke
from
column
of
fours
into
column
of
platoons
the
cheers
that
greeted
their
prompt
and
execution
of
the
manœuvre
which
is
always
an
awkward
one
unless
it
is
well
done
were
always
deafening
the
camp
was
always
pitched
upon
a
little
rise
of
ground
about
three
miles
from
the
village
in
front
of
it
was
the
river
on
its
left
arose
a
range
of
hills
which
were
almost
high
enough
to
be
called
mountains
and
among
these
hills
were
located
the
streams
and
ponds
in
which
the
speckled
trout
pickerel
sunfish
and
bass
abounded
here
too
were
found
the
thieving
raccoons
that
ravaged
the
farmers
the
hawks
that
caught
their
chickens
and
the
black
and
gray
squirrels
which
afforded
the
boys
many
an
exciting
hunt
and
excellent
dinner
between
these
hills
and
the
camp
ran
a
wide
and
deep
creek
whose
rapid
current
often
baffled
the
skill
of
the
young
engineers
who
tried
to
throw
a
across
it
on
reaching
the
camping
ground
the
arms
were
stacked
and
the
tents
which
had
already
arrived
were
distributed
among
the
different
companies
and
pitched
at
the
tap
of
the
drum
then
were
detailed
to
grade
and
ditch
the
streets
provide
for
the
kitchens
and
to
perform
various
other
duties
and
when
they
were
relieved
at
four
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
the
little
camp
presented
a
scene
of
neatness
and
order
with
which
the
most
exacting
officer
could
not
have
found
a
word
of
fault
there
were
several
orders
read
that
night
on
and
among
them
was
one
that
expressly
prohibited
don
could
not
see
the
necessity
for
such
an
order
so
he
waited
for
an
opportunity
to
speak
to
egan
about
it
it
means
said
the
latter
in
response
to
don
s
inquiries
that
we
mustn
t
steal
anything
from
the
farmers
so
i
supposed
but
who
is
there
among
us
who
would
be
mean
enough
to
do
such
a
thing
i
don
t
know
about
it
s
being
mean
replied
the
sergeant
in
a
tone
of
voice
that
made
don
open
his
eyes
we
want
something
good
to
eat
don
t
we
of
course
we
do
but
why
can
t
we
buy
what
we
want
we
ve
all
got
a
little
that
s
very
likely
but
it
is
cheaper
to
but
suppose
you
are
caught
at
it
that
s
your
lookout
you
must
be
sharp
enough
to
get
away
with
your
plunder
after
you
have
secured
i
ll
not
try
it
said
don
decidedly
i
ve
had
trouble
enough
this
term
and
i
am
not
going
to
have
any
more
black
marks
placed
against
my
name
if
i
can
help
it
besides
i
don
t
see
what
there
is
to
o
there
are
lots
of
things
the
farmers
hardly
ever
lock
their
and
it
s
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
slip
into
one
of
them
and
take
a
good
swig
out
of
a
pan
of
milk
that
has
cream
on
it
an
inch
thick
ah
said
the
sergeant
smacking
his
lips
that
s
the
way
hop
got
himself
into
a
snarl
last
not
court
hopkins
exclaimed
don
yes
courtland
hopkins
he
and
a
party
of
fellows
went
down
to
hudson
s
one
day
after
some
eggs
and
the
way
that
same
farmer
hudson
always
has
a
splendid
melon
patch
and
the
melons
will
begin
to
ripen
pretty
while
some
of
the
boys
were
occupying
the
attention
of
the
farmer
s
wife
hop
slipped
around
to
the
and
there
he
found
a
jar
full
of
fresh
buttermilk
that
was
too
much
for
hop
who
can
make
way
with
more
buttermilk
than
any
boy
ever
saw
he
grabbed
the
jar
and
made
off
with
it
but
just
as
he
was
leaving
the
hudson
who
was
at
work
in
a
field
close
by
caught
sight
of
him
and
started
in
pursuit
hop
heard
him
coming
and
knowing
that
he
could
not
escape
with
his
burden
he
put
it
down
never
spilling
a
drop
of
the
milk
and
took
to
his
heels
fat
as
he
is
he
led
hudson
a
good
long
chase
but
he
was
collared
at
last
and
taken
to
don
was
utterly
amazed
here
was
hopkins
who
was
looked
upon
by
all
his
companions
as
a
model
of
perfection
and
yet
he
had
been
caught
in
the
act
of
stealing
and
here
was
egan
another
good
scholar
and
a
officer
besides
who
told
the
story
of
his
friend
s
guilt
as
though
it
were
something
well
worth
relating
don
could
not
understand
it
what
did
they
do
with
him
he
asked
as
soon
as
he
had
somewhat
recovered
from
his
surprise
well
the
superintendent
thought
that
was
carrying
matters
a
little
too
far
and
so
he
refused
hop
a
pass
for
a
week
was
the
sergeant
s
reply
but
he
didn
t
gain
any
black
marks
by
how
was
that
inquired
don
why
you
see
your
record
for
the
term
is
all
made
up
and
the
hooks
are
closed
and
any
mischief
you
may
do
here
in
camp
will
not
count
against
you
in
the
examination
we
come
out
here
to
have
fun
and
the
teachers
are
willing
we
should
have
it
so
long
as
we
keep
within
bounds
the
farmers
around
here
make
lots
of
money
out
of
us
every
year
and
if
we
want
to
go
into
their
orchards
and
and
help
ourselves
to
what
we
find
there
we
are
welcome
to
do
it
if
we
go
about
it
openly
and
above
board
but
if
we
try
to
forage
on
them
they
enter
into
the
spirit
of
the
matter
as
fully
as
we
do
and
make
every
effort
to
capture
us
if
they
succeed
they
march
us
to
camp
and
all
the
boys
laugh
at
us
and
we
have
to
fork
over
money
enough
to
pay
for
the
articles
we
took
whatever
they
are
but
after
all
one
don
t
lose
anything
by
it
for
very
likely
that
same
farmer
will
meet
you
the
next
day
and
give
you
a
peck
of
peaches
or
an
armful
of
or
a
as
big
as
you
can
don
began
to
understand
the
matter
now
and
to
see
why
it
was
that
the
students
looked
forward
to
their
month
in
camp
with
so
much
eagerness
and
impatience
here
were
opportunities
for
him
to
work
off
a
little
of
his
superabundant
energy
without
violating
any
rules
or
doing
harm
to
anybody
and
those
who
are
acquainted
with
him
will
know
that
he
was
not
long
in
making
up
his
mind
to
improve
them
but
there
is
one
thing
we
have
to
keep
constantly
before
us
continued
the
sergeant
who
did
not
fail
to
notice
and
to
rightly
interpret
the
look
he
saw
in
don
s
eye
the
teachers
do
not
object
to
innocent
fun
but
anything
that
savors
of
meanness
won
t
go
down
if
a
boy
oversteps
the
mark
he
goes
back
to
the
academy
and
stays
there
under
guard
duncan
went
back
last
camp
for
trying
to
rob
a
the
farmer
who
owned
the
fowls
laughed
and
said
it
was
all
right
but
the
teachers
didn
t
think
so
i
never
foraged
so
much
as
an
ear
of
corn
but
i
am
a
number
one
deserter
echoed
don
growing
more
and
more
interested
yes
you
see
we
want
to
do
things
here
just
as
they
are
done
in
a
regular
camp
and
there
is
much
more
fun
in
working
up
a
case
against
a
real
culprit
who
will
try
by
every
means
in
his
power
to
hide
his
guilt
than
there
is
in
trumping
up
a
charge
against
some
innocent
boy
i
have
deserted
every
time
i
have
been
in
what
did
they
do
with
you
nothing
for
i
got
back
before
i
was
caught
if
i
had
been
captured
by
any
of
the
scouting
parties
that
were
sent
out
in
pursuit
of
me
i
should
have
been
and
ordered
to
the
to
await
sentence
that
s
the
way
they
did
with
hop
who
was
sentenced
to
be
shot
but
then
he
deserted
when
the
camp
was
supposed
to
be
surrounded
by
the
enemy
hop
always
was
unlucky
he
can
t
do
any
mischief
without
being
caught
at
how
did
they
carry
out
the
sentence
asked
don
they
didn
t
carry
it
out
they
simply
put
him
in
the
and
about
midnight
the
officer
of
the
day
came
along
and
let
him
out
and
that
was
the
last
of
it
when
the
members
of
the
grand
army
of
the
republic
hold
their
encampments
and
capture
a
deserter
or
a
spy
they
go
through
all
the
the
prisoner
blindfolded
on
a
coffin
and
shooting
at
him
with
blank
cartridges
but
we
don
t
believe
in
that
it
is
almost
too
much
like
the
reality
by
the
way
gordon
that
great
european
railroad
show
is
advertised
to
pitch
its
tent
in
bridgeport
very
shortly
and
i
should
really
like
to
see
the
man
who
turns
a
double
somerset
over
three
elephants
and
four
camels
wouldn
t
you
of
course
i
would
and
i
ll
go
if
you
will
shall
we
ask
for
a
pass
certainly
not
because
we
don
t
intend
to
come
back
until
we
get
ready
the
boys
all
want
to
get
out
of
the
lines
for
exercise
and
nothing
would
suit
them
better
than
tramping
about
the
country
in
search
of
just
then
the
officer
of
the
day
appeared
at
the
door
of
his
tent
and
beckoned
to
the
sergeant
who
hurried
away
leaving
don
to
himself
the
latter
wished
most
heartily
that
that
great
european
railroad
show
had
been
billed
to
appear
at
bridgeport
that
very
night
for
he
was
in
just
the
right
humor
for
an
adventure
like
egan
he
had
no
taste
for
foraging
it
is
true
that
he
had
joined
in
raids
upon
when
they
were
closely
guarded
and
when
he
knew
that
speedy
punishment
would
be
visited
upon
him
if
he
were
discovered
and
captured
and
he
might
without
a
great
deal
of
urging
have
been
induced
to
do
the
same
thing
over
again
if
there
were
any
risk
to
be
run
but
the
thought
of
plundering
a
farmer
who
would
freely
have
given
him
all
the
melons
he
wanted
was
not
to
be
entertained
for
a
moment
desertion
as
proposed
by
egan
was
according
to
don
s
way
of
thinking
a
more
proceeding
creeping
unobserved
past
the
sentries
visiting
an
entertainment
that
would
doubtless
be
witnessed
by
a
majority
of
the
teachers
and
fifty
or
perhaps
a
hundred
of
their
all
of
whom
would
be
glad
to
report
them
just
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
roaming
about
the
country
wherever
their
fancy
led
them
dodging
the
scouting
parties
that
were
sent
in
pursuit
and
at
last
when
weary
of
their
freedom
making
their
way
back
to
camp
and
into
their
tents
without
being
was
something
interesting
and
exciting
in
all
this
and
the
longer
don
thought
of
it
the
more
he
wished
that
the
show
would
hasten
its
coming
during
the
first
two
weeks
the
students
were
kept
at
work
at
something
nearly
all
the
time
and
there
were
but
few
passes
granted
don
and
egan
were
among
those
who
were
lucky
enough
to
get
out
of
the
lines
for
an
afternoon
and
before
they
came
back
they
had
made
arrangements
for
procuring
citizen
s
clothes
in
which
to
visit
the
show
when
it
arrived
after
that
don
became
more
impatient
and
uneasy
than
ever
and
proposed
to
his
friend
egan
that
they
should
desert
at
once
and
stay
out
until
the
show
left
town
oh
that
would
never
do
was
the
sergeant
s
reply
we
want
to
absent
ourselves
only
on
our
off
is
on
days
when
there
is
no
work
to
be
done
in
surveying
or
in
artillery
and
you
know
i
am
to
complete
the
course
this
year
and
as
i
want
to
pass
a
good
examination
i
must
be
on
hand
to
receive
all
the
practical
instruction
i
can
i
wouldn
t
like
to
miss
but
we
don
t
seem
to
have
any
off
days
answered
don
we
are
kept
busy
all
the
time
what
s
the
use
of
surrounding
the
camp
with
these
there
are
two
reasons
for
it
in
the
first
place
the
enemy
may
be
hovering
around
watching
for
a
chance
to
make
an
attack
upon
don
laughed
outright
and
in
the
next
place
you
want
to
learn
just
how
to
go
to
work
to
fortify
a
camp
in
case
you
should
ever
have
command
of
which
is
not
at
all
likely
interrupted
don
why
can
t
the
engineers
stake
out
the
works
so
that
we
could
see
the
shape
of
them
and
stop
at
that
i
didn
t
come
here
to
handle
picks
and
shovels
for
so
many
hours
every
day
and
i
don
t
see
any
sense
in
almost
the
first
thing
the
superintendent
did
after
the
students
were
fairly
settled
in
their
new
quarters
was
to
put
the
engineers
at
work
laying
out
a
very
elaborate
system
of
fortifications
with
which
the
entire
camp
was
surrounded
the
boys
would
have
made
no
complaint
if
he
had
been
satisfied
with
that
but
he
wasn
t
when
the
fortifications
had
been
laid
out
he
detailed
to
build
them
just
as
he
would
have
done
if
the
camp
had
been
located
in
an
enemy
s
country
such
a
thing
had
never
been
done
before
and
don
gordon
was
not
the
only
one
who
could
not
see
any
sense
in
it
at
first
the
boys
laughed
at
their
sergeants
and
corporals
who
urged
them
to
greater
exertions
with
their
picks
and
shovels
assuring
them
at
the
same
time
that
an
attack
might
be
expected
at
any
moment
and
finally
they
began
to
get
angry
with
them
but
the
attack
was
made
all
the
same
but
these
days
of
toil
were
ended
at
last
and
when
the
old
soldiers
who
lived
in
bridgeport
came
out
and
inspected
the
works
and
declared
with
one
voice
that
in
everything
except
extent
they
were
equal
to
any
with
which
the
confederates
had
surrounded
vicksburg
and
richmond
the
boys
felt
that
they
were
in
some
measure
repaid
for
their
labor
they
made
the
most
of
the
days
of
recreation
that
followed
passes
were
freely
granted
and
every
boy
who
went
outside
the
lines
made
it
a
point
to
bring
back
something
for
his
one
day
while
don
was
lounging
in
his
tent
egan
appeared
at
the
door
and
beckoned
him
to
come
out
in
one
hand
he
carried
a
huge
yellow
poster
which
he
passed
over
to
don
with
the
request
that
the
latter
would
read
it
at
his
leisure
and
at
the
same
time
he
held
up
the
forefinger
of
the
other
hand
as
if
he
were
listening
to
something
don
listened
also
and
presently
the
breeze
bore
to
his
ear
the
enlivening
strains
of
martial
music
they
ve
come
said
egan
and
they
are
now
making
their
street
parade
are
you
ready
i
am
answered
don
well
say
one
o
clock
then
i
shall
be
busy
with
my
reports
why
man
alive
interrupted
don
are
we
going
to
run
the
guard
in
broad
daylight
how
in
the
world
are
we
going
to
help
it
demanded
egan
in
reply
we
ought
to
have
gone
out
last
night
when
we
would
have
had
the
darkness
to
aid
us
said
don
who
began
to
think
that
his
chances
for
seeing
that
wonderful
leaper
were
very
slim
indeed
i
couldn
t
have
gone
last
night
for
i
was
busy
and
as
i
told
you
i
don
t
want
to
be
out
of
camp
when
my
class
is
under
instruction
i
shall
be
busy
until
about
one
o
clock
but
after
my
work
is
done
i
am
going
to
that
show
are
you
going
with
me
don
answered
very
decidedly
that
he
was
i
don
t
deny
that
we
shall
have
a
tight
squeak
for
it
continued
the
sergeant
pulling
off
his
cap
and
scratching
his
head
in
deep
perplexity
you
see
there
used
to
be
a
little
ridge
out
there
in
the
upper
end
of
the
camp
that
ran
close
by
the
side
of
post
no
it
was
thickly
lined
with
bushes
under
cover
of
which
a
fellow
who
was
at
all
cautious
in
his
movements
could
creep
by
the
sentry
very
easily
but
when
these
were
built
that
ridge
was
cut
away
and
i
haven
t
yet
been
able
to
decide
how
we
are
going
to
get
out
although
i
have
reconnoitered
every
part
of
the
camp
more
than
a
dozen
look
here
said
don
perhaps
one
of
the
sentries
could
be
prevailed
upon
to
keep
his
back
turned
no
he
couldn
t
interrupted
egan
who
knew
very
well
what
don
was
about
to
say
there
isn
t
a
boy
in
camp
who
wouldn
t
report
his
best
friend
if
he
had
the
chance
just
for
the
sake
of
getting
a
joke
on
just
then
hopkins
and
curtis
came
hurrying
by
their
faces
wore
a
pleased
expression
and
each
held
in
his
hand
a
piece
of
paper
which
he
flourished
exultantly
over
his
head
we
re
going
to
see
the
elephants
and
the
lions
and
tigers
and
all
the
other
things
said
curtis
i
say
boys
if
you
want
passes
you
d
better
not
be
standing
here
the
fellows
are
packed
around
the
superintendent
s
marquée
as
closely
as
sardines
in
a
don
and
egan
replied
that
they
had
concluded
not
to
ask
for
passes
on
that
particular
day
and
hopkins
and
his
friend
hurried
on
to
their
tents
to
exchange
their
fatigue
suits
for
their
dress
uniforms
i
haven
t
yet
been
able
to
decide
how
we
are
going
to
get
out
repeated
the
sergeant
when
he
and
don
were
left
alone
but
don
t
you
worry
about
that
i
ll
hit
upon
something
before
the
time
for
action
all
right
replied
don
i
ll
be
ready
when
you
want
egan
turned
toward
his
tent
and
don
went
back
into
his
he
spent
the
time
until
dinner
in
reading
the
poster
the
sergeant
had
given
him
hundreds
of
which
had
that
morning
been
distributed
about
the
camp
by
village
boys
who
were
hired
for
that
purpose
and
then
he
made
his
toilet
and
waited
for
the
hands
on
his
watch
to
travel
around
to
one
o
clock
they
had
scarcely
got
there
before
sergeant
egan
put
in
an
appearance
carrying
in
his
hand
a
small
tin
pail
he
seemed
somewhat
disconcerted
when
he
looked
into
don
s
tent
for
it
was
full
of
boys
come
in
sergeant
said
bert
pleasantly
where
are
you
going
inquired
don
to
the
spring
after
some
fresh
water
i
suppose
hold
on
till
i
get
a
bucket
and
i
will
go
with
so
will
i
said
bert
that
wouldn
t
do
at
all
the
sergeant
looked
perplexed
but
don
was
equal
to
the
emergency
bert
said
he
you
stay
here
till
i
come
back
and
i
will
have
something
to
tell
the
confiding
bert
was
enough
to
submit
without
any
argument
and
don
having
secured
a
bucket
walked
off
with
the
sergeant
to
his
great
surprise
egan
led
the
way
directly
to
the
principal
gate
and
the
sentry
who
was
on
duty
there
allowed
them
to
pass
without
a
word
of
protest
he
had
no
business
to
do
it
and
if
they
had
exhibited
the
least
timidity
or
been
at
all
uncertain
in
their
movements
they
would
have
been
halted
on
the
instant
but
as
it
was
their
audacity
carried
them
safely
through
if
don
had
been
alone
he
would
have
been
stopped
beyond
a
doubt
but
the
fact
that
he
was
in
the
company
of
a
officer
who
however
had
no
more
right
to
go
outside
the
lines
than
a
private
had
disarmed
the
sentry
of
all
suspicion
illustration
running
the
guard
the
two
deserters
astonished
and
delighted
at
the
ease
with
which
their
escape
had
been
effected
but
showing
no
outward
signs
of
exultation
walked
slowly
toward
the
spring
which
bubbled
up
among
the
rocks
about
fifty
yards
from
the
gate
their
every
movement
being
closely
watched
by
the
sentry
who
began
to
wonder
if
he
had
done
just
right
in
permitting
them
to
pass
they
made
a
great
show
of
washing
out
their
pails
stopping
now
and
then
to
point
out
to
each
other
objects
of
interest
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
creek
all
of
which
they
had
seen
a
hundred
times
before
and
at
last
pretending
to
discover
something
at
a
little
distance
that
they
considered
to
be
worthy
of
close
examination
they
set
down
their
buckets
and
moved
down
the
bank
of
the
stream
that
movement
aroused
the
sentry
who
now
began
to
see
through
the
little
game
that
had
been
so
neatly
played
upon
him
halt
he
shouted
bringing
his
musket
to
arms
now
for
it
gordon
said
egan
in
an
excited
whisper
leg
bail
is
all
that
will
save
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
the
sergeant
pulled
his
fatigue
cap
down
over
his
ears
and
darted
through
the
bushes
like
a
frightened
hare
don
following
close
at
his
heels
chapter
xii
the
deserters
at
the
show
halt
shouted
the
sentry
corporal
of
the
guard
no
this
is
a
regular
game
of
follow
the
leader
gordon
said
egan
looking
back
over
his
shoulder
are
you
good
at
that
i
used
to
be
answered
don
they
ll
be
after
us
in
less
than
no
time
continued
the
sergeant
and
as
there
are
some
splendid
runners
among
the
fellows
who
will
give
us
more
than
we
want
to
do
if
they
come
up
with
us
our
game
must
be
to
keep
out
of
sight
we
can
t
run
much
further
in
this
direction
for
the
river
will
stop
us
so
that
the
best
thing
we
can
do
here
egan
turned
like
a
flash
and
jumped
as
far
as
he
could
toward
the
middle
of
the
creek
the
water
was
deep
enough
to
let
him
down
out
of
sight
but
he
arose
to
the
surface
almost
immediately
and
struck
out
for
the
opposite
shore
don
was
astonished
but
he
did
not
hesitate
an
instant
to
follow
his
settling
his
cap
firmly
on
his
head
he
dove
from
the
bank
and
swimming
rapidly
under
the
water
passed
egan
much
to
that
young
gentleman
s
surprise
and
came
up
a
long
way
ahead
of
him
a
few
long
steady
strokes
carried
them
across
the
stream
and
while
they
were
climbing
out
by
the
aid
of
the
bushes
that
hung
over
the
water
voices
and
footsteps
sounded
from
the
bank
they
had
just
left
and
presently
ejaculations
indicative
of
the
greatest
amazement
came
to
their
ears
followed
by
ringing
peals
of
laughter
ha
ha
ha
i
say
you
ha
ha
and
dear
o
dear
this
will
be
the
death
of
me
i
just
ha
halt
was
the
command
that
was
shouted
at
them
from
the
other
side
of
the
creek
and
looking
over
their
shoulders
they
saw
on
the
bank
a
party
of
their
pursuers
some
of
whom
stamped
about
and
flourished
their
arms
over
their
heads
as
if
they
were
fighting
off
a
swarm
of
while
the
others
rolled
on
the
ground
or
stood
in
a
crouching
attitude
holding
their
hands
firmly
against
their
sides
they
were
all
convulsed
with
laughter
and
the
corporal
who
commanded
the
squad
and
who
thought
he
had
never
before
seen
so
ludicrous
a
sight
as
the
deserters
presented
in
their
dripping
uniforms
was
so
completely
overcome
with
merriment
that
he
could
not
speak
again
he
stood
there
on
the
bank
shaking
his
head
and
slapping
his
knees
until
egan
and
his
companion
disappeared
in
the
woods
well
gordon
what
do
you
think
of
the
situation
asked
the
sergeant
throwing
himself
flat
on
his
back
and
holding
his
feet
aloft
so
that
the
water
could
run
out
of
his
boots
i
m
seeing
lots
of
fun
answered
don
wiping
the
tears
from
his
eyes
for
he
had
laughed
as
heartily
as
any
of
the
corporal
s
men
but
do
you
think
we
can
get
through
we
must
get
through
replied
the
sergeant
earnestly
if
we
should
be
caught
and
taken
back
after
what
we
have
done
the
boys
never
would
quit
joking
us
that
corporal
is
a
good
fellow
to
keep
out
of
the
way
of
he
s
as
sharp
as
any
detective
as
fleet
as
an
antelope
and
if
he
once
gets
a
grip
on
a
deserter
s
collar
he
don
t
let
up
he
s
a
bad
one
and
if
he
isn
t
recalled
he
will
follow
us
all
over
the
if
he
is
as
persevering
as
that
what
s
the
reason
he
did
not
swim
the
creek
in
pursuit
of
us
asked
don
he
wouldn
t
have
made
anything
by
it
answered
the
sergeant
and
besides
he
wouldn
t
care
to
go
tramping
about
the
country
in
his
wet
clothes
he
will
follow
a
better
plan
than
that
he
will
cross
at
the
bridge
and
go
over
to
the
main
road
and
try
to
ambush
us
you
see
if
he
don
having
wrung
a
little
of
the
water
out
of
their
clothes
don
and
his
companion
continued
their
flight
threading
their
way
rapidly
but
cautiously
through
the
thick
woods
but
before
they
had
gone
two
hundred
yards
the
sergeant
who
was
acting
as
guide
stopped
all
on
a
sudden
and
pointed
silently
before
him
don
looked
and
saw
that
they
had
barely
escaped
running
into
an
ambuscade
that
had
been
prepared
for
them
having
crossed
the
creek
at
the
bridge
corporal
mack
and
his
men
had
made
the
best
of
their
way
to
the
main
road
and
were
now
hidden
in
the
bushes
on
each
side
of
it
awaiting
the
approach
of
the
deserters
don
could
see
their
uniform
caps
and
he
counted
a
dozen
of
them
in
all
mack
knows
that
we
are
going
to
the
show
and
he
will
exert
himself
to
the
utmost
to
prevent
it
said
the
sergeant
after
he
and
don
had
made
a
wide
detour
and
safely
passed
the
ambuscade
we
must
hurry
on
now
for
we
are
not
safe
so
long
as
we
wear
these
it
would
have
been
much
easier
walking
in
the
main
road
which
was
in
plain
sight
of
them
but
the
sergeant
dared
not
follow
it
for
he
and
don
were
in
no
condition
weighed
down
as
they
were
by
their
wet
clothing
to
engage
in
a
with
the
fleet
and
persevering
corporal
who
would
be
sure
to
see
them
the
moment
they
came
out
of
their
concealment
so
they
kept
to
the
bushes
and
at
the
end
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
came
to
a
halt
in
the
rear
of
a
snug
little
which
was
the
home
of
one
asa
peters
who
had
agreed
for
a
suitable
consideration
to
furnish
them
with
disguises
whenever
they
might
stand
in
need
of
them
asa
was
chopping
wood
in
the
back
yard
and
egan
had
no
difficulty
in
attracting
his
attention
hearing
his
name
pronounced
in
a
cautious
tone
asa
threw
down
his
axe
and
after
looking
all
around
to
make
sure
that
his
movements
were
not
observed
he
climbed
the
fence
and
joined
the
deserters
behind
the
where
they
had
stopped
for
concealment
he
was
a
stalwart
young
rustic
with
a
red
head
a
peaked
nose
and
a
freckled
homely
in
short
but
with
a
most
exalted
opinion
of
his
personal
appearance
i
say
asa
said
egan
hurriedly
we
want
those
clothes
now
is
there
any
way
for
us
to
get
into
the
house
without
being
seen
asa
leaned
against
the
and
twirled
his
thumbs
but
said
nothing
what
s
the
matter
asked
egan
in
some
alarm
you
are
not
going
back
from
your
word
are
you
you
agreed
to
furnish
each
of
us
with
a
suit
of
your
clothes
for
a
dollar
apiece
and
we
expect
you
to
live
up
to
your
wal
drawled
you
he
blushed
and
hesitated
well
go
on
what
about
sally
asked
don
impatiently
she
doesn
t
want
to
borrow
your
clothes
does
she
eh
no
said
asa
indignantly
but
she
wants
to
go
to
the
show
an
how
am
i
goin
to
take
her
when
i
aint
got
no
duds
to
go
in
that
s
what
s
been
a
botherin
me
an
you
see
if
i
don
t
take
her
bijah
sawin
well
let
bijah
have
her
said
don
not
by
a
long
asa
glared
savagely
at
don
as
he
said
this
and
brought
his
fist
down
into
his
open
palm
with
a
sounding
whack
the
idea
of
allowing
a
rival
to
walk
off
with
his
sweetheart
was
not
to
be
entertained
for
a
moment
don
looked
blank
but
egan
who
had
had
dealings
with
asa
before
thought
he
knew
a
sure
road
to
his
heart
now
asa
said
he
coaxingly
listen
to
me
for
a
moment
i
know
that
sally
is
a
beauty
egan
had
never
seen
the
girl
in
his
life
but
there
are
plenty
of
others
in
the
world
who
are
just
as
handsome
and
a
dashing
young
fellow
like
yourself
can
always
take
his
asa
stroked
the
yellow
down
on
his
chin
and
grinned
complacently
besides
we
ll
make
it
worth
your
while
to
stick
to
your
bargain
continued
egan
closely
watching
the
effect
of
his
words
we
will
give
you
a
dollar
extra
for
the
use
of
your
asa
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
interested
we
mean
by
that
a
dollar
extra
for
the
use
of
each
suit
put
in
don
and
if
you
want
it
we
will
pay
you
half
the
money
in
it
was
evident
from
the
expression
on
the
face
of
asa
peters
that
there
was
a
severe
conflict
going
on
in
his
conflict
between
his
love
of
money
and
his
affection
for
sally
but
avarice
conquered
at
last
and
without
saying
a
word
asa
climbed
the
fence
and
led
the
way
toward
the
house
followed
by
the
deserters
who
exchanged
many
a
wink
and
laughed
silently
at
the
boy
who
was
willing
to
give
up
his
sweetheart
for
two
dollars
asa
led
the
deserters
up
the
back
stairs
and
into
his
room
whose
front
window
which
was
open
looked
out
upon
the
road
while
he
was
taking
from
his
trunk
his
cherished
wearing
apparel
the
judicious
selection
of
which
had
occasioned
him
infinite
trouble
and
perplexity
don
glanced
out
at
the
window
and
saw
corporal
mack
and
his
men
approaching
i
declare
egan
said
he
we
re
o
no
said
the
latter
who
was
making
all
haste
to
get
out
of
his
wet
uniform
mack
doesn
t
know
that
we
are
here
and
even
if
he
suspected
it
he
has
no
right
to
search
the
having
placed
his
best
suits
of
clothes
in
orderly
array
upon
the
bed
the
deep
sighs
he
uttered
while
he
was
thus
engaged
proved
that
sally
was
not
yet
wholly
forgotten
asa
seated
himself
on
his
trunk
and
looked
out
of
the
window
while
don
and
his
companion
proceeded
to
put
on
their
disguises
and
disguises
they
proved
to
be
in
every
sense
of
the
word
it
is
doubtful
if
even
the
sharp
eyes
of
corporal
mack
could
have
penetrated
them
the
boys
looked
for
all
the
world
like
a
couple
of
green
country
fellows
who
were
out
for
a
holiday
and
when
don
after
disarranging
his
hair
and
assuming
an
expression
of
countenance
that
would
have
done
credit
to
mark
twain
s
inspired
idiot
walked
across
the
floor
after
the
manner
of
a
plantation
darkey
egan
who
never
could
control
himself
when
he
wanted
to
laugh
rolled
on
the
bed
convulsed
with
merriment
nothing
but
the
near
approach
of
corporal
mack
and
his
men
kept
him
from
shouting
at
the
top
of
his
voice
look
here
gordon
said
he
as
soon
as
he
could
speak
no
more
of
that
you
will
give
us
away
sure
mack
is
a
southern
boy
and
he
knows
the
negro
style
of
progression
as
well
as
you
do
so
mind
what
you
are
just
then
the
clear
tones
of
corporal
mack
sounded
under
the
window
hallo
asa
said
he
seen
any
of
our
boys
around
here
lately
wal
yes
drawled
asa
in
reply
i
seed
a
power
of
em
have
you
seen
any
of
them
wal
yes
but
i
seed
a
right
smart
sprinklin
of
em
don
t
say
that
again
asa
whispered
egan
excitedly
if
you
do
you
will
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
sure
that
boy
is
sharper
than
a
steel
trap
and
you
must
be
careful
how
you
talk
to
you
say
you
have
seen
some
of
our
boys
continued
the
corporal
were
their
names
egan
and
gordon
i
thought
so
well
where
are
they
now
i
don
t
rightly
know
where
they
be
answered
asa
and
he
didn
t
either
for
his
back
was
turned
toward
the
two
boys
in
question
i
see
very
plainly
that
there
is
nothing
to
be
gained
by
questioning
you
said
the
corporal
whose
suspicions
had
been
aroused
you
know
where
those
two
fellows
are
and
when
you
see
them
again
you
may
tell
them
that
we
are
going
to
the
show
asa
said
he
would
and
the
corporal
and
his
squad
moved
off
what
did
i
tell
you
exclaimed
egan
didn
t
i
say
that
if
he
wasn
t
recalled
he
would
follow
us
all
over
the
country
now
let
s
be
moving
we
ll
keep
out
of
sight
as
much
as
possible
until
we
reach
the
village
and
after
we
have
got
into
the
crowd
we
shall
be
comparatively
safe
but
remember
this
if
you
are
separated
from
me
by
any
mischance
dodge
every
fellow
in
uniform
you
see
no
matter
whether
he
wears
a
bayonet
by
his
side
or
not
even
hop
and
curtis
would
report
us
to
the
corporal
if
they
should
see
and
recognize
don
had
never
engaged
in
an
undertaking
that
was
more
to
his
liking
it
was
one
that
required
the
exercise
of
all
the
skill
and
cunning
he
possessed
and
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
while
he
was
working
to
the
utmost
to
accomplish
his
object
he
was
violating
no
rule
and
was
in
no
danger
of
being
taken
to
task
when
he
returned
to
camp
having
paid
asa
a
portion
of
the
money
they
had
agreed
to
give
him
for
the
use
of
his
clothes
don
and
his
companion
made
the
best
of
their
way
toward
bridgeport
which
was
filled
to
overflowing
with
people
from
the
surrounding
country
who
had
flocked
in
to
see
the
sights
they
mingled
with
the
crowd
and
acted
their
parts
as
rustics
to
perfection
they
gazed
with
open
mouth
and
eyes
at
every
thing
they
saw
munched
apples
and
gingerbread
as
they
walked
along
and
tried
to
beat
down
the
price
of
candy
as
often
as
they
stopped
to
purchase
they
went
into
all
the
to
see
the
curiosities
on
exhibition
and
manfully
bore
their
part
in
the
crush
and
jam
that
took
place
when
the
was
opened
up
to
this
time
they
had
succeeded
in
keeping
out
of
the
way
of
their
all
of
whom
having
been
warned
by
the
corporal
were
keeping
a
sharp
for
them
but
now
they
ran
against
some
of
them
almost
before
they
knew
it
having
secured
their
tickets
after
a
terrific
struggle
they
moved
with
the
crowd
toward
the
entrance
to
the
grand
pavilion
and
all
on
a
sudden
found
themselves
face
to
face
with
four
of
the
corporal
s
men
don
and
his
friend
knew
that
they
belonged
to
mack
s
squad
for
they
wore
bayonets
by
their
sides
to
show
that
they
were
on
duty
they
stood
two
on
each
side
of
the
entrance
and
looked
closely
at
everybody
who
went
in
the
situation
was
growing
interesting
and
it
grew
still
more
interesting
before
the
afternoon
was
over
and
some
of
the
village
people
afterward
declared
that
don
and
corporal
mack
furnished
the
best
part
of
the
entertainment
now
for
it
gordon
said
egan
in
an
excited
whisper
see
how
they
stare
at
everybody
that
proves
that
they
either
know
or
suspect
that
we
are
disguised
it
would
be
a
pity
if
we
were
to
be
gobbled
right
here
in
the
presence
of
all
these
people
how
everybody
would
laugh
at
us
but
both
the
boys
were
equal
to
the
emergency
egan
trusting
entirely
to
his
disguise
kept
straight
ahead
without
looking
at
the
sentries
while
don
throwing
all
the
stupidity
he
could
into
an
unusually
intelligent
countenance
gazed
about
him
with
a
frightened
air
and
clung
to
his
friend
s
as
if
he
were
afraid
of
being
lost
that
move
came
very
near
being
fatal
to
them
egan
laughed
audibly
in
spite
of
himself
and
hurried
on
dragging
don
after
him
while
the
four
guards
exchanged
significant
glances
and
one
of
them
hurried
out
to
find
corporal
mack
the
deserters
did
not
know
it
but
from
that
moment
they
were
under
surveillance
having
taken
a
look
at
the
animals
they
went
into
the
second
tent
picked
out
a
good
seat
invested
a
portion
of
their
in
peanuts
and
waited
patiently
for
the
performance
to
begin
they
did
not
pay
much
attention
to
the
stale
jokes
of
the
clowns
but
they
were
really
interested
in
the
riding
and
much
so
that
they
did
not
notice
that
corporal
mack
was
improving
the
opportunity
to
station
his
men
so
that
they
could
not
escape
finally
the
trick
mule
was
brought
in
and
after
he
had
gone
through
with
his
antics
and
thrown
the
darkey
who
tried
to
ride
him
some
of
the
spectators
went
out
while
those
who
had
purchased
tickets
for
the
musical
entertainment
moved
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
tent
among
the
latter
were
don
and
egan
by
this
time
don
had
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
he
had
made
himself
an
object
of
interest
to
the
people
about
him
who
told
one
another
that
he
was
the
greenest
specimen
of
a
country
boy
they
had
ever
seen
when
he
moved
with
the
rest
over
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
tent
he
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
give
a
specimen
of
old
jordan
s
style
of
locomotion
and
he
did
it
so
perfectly
that
he
excited
the
laughter
of
some
and
the
sincere
pity
of
others
who
believed
that
that
was
his
usual
way
of
walking
there
was
one
however
who
was
keeping
a
sharp
eye
on
all
his
movements
and
who
was
not
spruce
young
soldier
who
elbowed
his
way
through
the
crowd
and
to
the
surprise
of
everybody
laid
hold
of
the
young
countryman
s
collar
that
s
most
too
attenuated
said
he
with
a
laugh
no
white
fellow
ever
had
so
outlandish
a
gait
gordon
i
know
you
and
i
have
come
for
you
corporal
mack
had
never
yet
failed
to
capture
the
deserter
of
whom
he
had
been
sent
in
pursuit
he
was
noted
for
his
grip
he
had
confidence
in
it
and
when
he
placed
his
hand
on
don
s
collar
he
thought
he
had
him
sure
but
as
it
happened
he
didn
t
know
the
boy
he
was
trying
to
arrest
don
wheeled
as
quick
as
thought
tore
himself
lose
from
the
detaining
hand
and
took
to
his
heels
darting
like
a
flash
through
the
crowd
of
spectators
who
astonished
beyond
measure
to
see
the
awkward
clown
who
had
moved
so
slowly
and
painfully
over
the
ground
suddenly
transformed
into
a
runner
parted
right
and
left
to
give
him
room
and
cheered
him
lustily
as
he
passed
through
their
ranks
corporal
mack
started
in
hot
pursuit
his
men
who
had
been
stationed
around
the
outside
of
the
tent
drew
in
upon
the
fugitive
from
all
sides
while
egan
seeing
that
no
attention
was
paid
to
himself
crawled
through
between
the
seats
raised
the
canvas
and
took
himself
safely
off
it
was
an
amusing
as
well
as
an
exciting
race
that
came
off
in
that
tent
that
afternoon
and
the
shouts
of
laughter
and
yells
of
encouragement
that
arose
on
all
sides
were
almost
deafening
don
in
his
clothes
and
big
cowhide
boots
looked
clumsy
enough
but
he
got
over
the
ground
at
an
astonishing
rate
seeing
that
every
way
of
escape
except
one
was
closed
against
him
he
dashed
straight
across
the
ring
toward
the
seats
that
had
just
been
vacated
he
ascended
to
the
topmost
one
in
half
a
dozen
jumps
and
diving
through
the
opening
between
the
top
of
the
tent
and
the
side
he
dropped
lightly
to
the
ground
and
continued
his
flight
the
cheers
and
laughter
of
the
amused
spectators
ringing
in
his
ears
as
he
went
there
were
two
long
freight
trains
standing
on
the
railroad
track
which
was
close
at
hand
toward
these
don
bent
his
steps
intent
on
getting
out
of
sight
as
soon
as
possible
and
without
pausing
to
consider
the
risk
he
ran
in
so
doing
he
crawled
under
one
of
the
cars
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
track
corporal
mack
followed
him
without
loss
of
time
but
when
he
arose
to
an
upright
position
after
crawling
under
the
car
don
was
not
to
be
seen
he
was
dodging
about
among
the
and
after
a
twenty
minutes
run
having
as
he
believed
placed
a
safe
distance
between
himself
and
his
pursuers
he
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
sidewalk
to
take
a
rest
pulling
asa
s
big
red
handkerchief
from
his
pocket
and
mopping
his
dripping
forehead
vigorously
he
broke
out
into
a
cheery
laugh
and
was
surprised
as
well
as
startled
to
hear
it
echoed
close
by
well
my
young
friend
you
seem
to
be
in
good
humor
said
a
pleasant
voice
don
looked
up
and
saw
before
him
an
old
gentleman
leaning
on
his
cane
and
beaming
at
him
over
his
gold
spectacles
yes
sir
said
he
respectfully
at
the
same
time
imitating
asa
s
drawl
i
ve
been
to
the
ah
indeed
and
you
saw
the
clowns
i
suppose
yes
sir
but
i
didn
t
care
for
them
i
seen
the
tigers
and
the
elephants
and
the
and
all
them
things
and
i
seen
that
there
throw
that
there
here
don
went
off
into
another
paroxysm
of
laughter
the
old
gentleman
laughed
too
and
passed
on
marveling
greatly
at
the
boy
s
innocence
and
wondering
where
in
the
world
he
came
from
after
taking
time
to
cool
off
a
little
and
to
recover
his
breath
don
got
upon
his
feet
and
walked
away
all
the
fun
was
over
now
so
far
as
the
show
was
concerned
his
disguise
being
known
it
would
be
dangerous
for
him
to
stay
about
the
village
and
the
only
thing
he
could
do
was
to
go
back
to
the
home
of
asa
peters
where
he
hoped
to
find
his
friend
egan
i
hope
he
wasn
t
captured
thought
don
for
i
should
find
it
very
lonely
roaming
about
the
woods
all
by
myself
besides
i
don
t
know
where
those
are
that
he
said
would
afford
us
so
much
sport
there
s
one
thing
about
it
i
am
out
and
i
shall
not
go
back
until
i
get
don
would
doubtless
have
been
very
much
surprised
if
any
one
had
told
him
that
when
he
got
ready
to
go
back
to
camp
he
would
not
be
allowed
to
do
so
but
such
was
the
case
as
he
found
when
he
made
the
attempt
just
before
dark
don
came
within
sight
of
asa
s
home
as
he
was
hurrying
along
the
road
not
dreaming
of
danger
he
heard
a
familiar
voice
calling
to
him
and
looking
in
the
direction
from
which
it
came
he
saw
his
missing
friend
egan
snugly
hidden
away
among
the
bushes
in
a
when
he
saw
that
he
had
attracted
don
s
attention
he
broke
out
into
a
hearty
peal
of
laughter
you
re
a
good
one
gordon
said
he
and
i
would
give
something
to
know
how
corporal
mack
feels
over
his
failure
to
make
a
prisoner
of
you
i
never
knew
a
boy
to
get
away
before
when
once
mack
got
a
good
grip
on
his
collar
and
neither
did
i
ever
see
no
cowhide
boots
climb
over
the
ground
so
rapidly
you
have
done
something
worth
boasting
what
are
you
doing
there
asked
don
waiting
for
you
come
over
here
i
struck
out
for
this
place
as
soon
as
i
could
get
out
of
the
tent
said
the
sergeant
as
don
climbed
the
fence
hoping
to
secure
possession
of
our
uniforms
before
the
corporal
could
get
here
but
he
and
his
men
hired
a
wagon
and
a
span
of
horses
and
got
ahead
of
do
you
mean
to
say
that
they
are
guarding
the
house
now
exclaimed
don
certainly
i
do
and
you
would
have
run
right
into
their
clutches
if
i
hadn
t
been
here
to
warn
you
they
ll
get
supper
and
sleep
there
and
we
must
look
elsewhere
for
grub
and
lodging
asa
will
be
in
a
fearful
way
about
his
good
clothes
but
we
can
t
help
that
we
can
t
get
our
uniforms
while
mack
is
prowling
egan
who
was
well
acquainted
in
the
neighborhood
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
food
and
shelter
for
himself
and
his
companion
another
opened
its
hospitable
doors
to
them
and
there
they
passed
the
night
setting
out
bright
and
early
the
next
morning
to
try
one
of
the
of
which
egan
had
spoken
late
in
the
afternoon
they
secured
an
interview
with
asa
who
after
telling
them
that
corporal
mack
had
been
recalled
that
morning
growled
lustily
at
them
for
keeping
his
clothes
so
long
in
order
to
silence
him
and
make
sure
of
other
disguises
in
future
in
case
they
should
need
them
they
gave
him
an
extra
dollar
and
paid
his
mother
the
same
amount
for
drying
and
pressing
out
their
uniforms
during
the
next
two
days
the
deserters
thoroughly
enjoyed
themselves
living
on
the
fat
of
the
land
and
catching
as
many
fish
as
they
could
dispose
of
on
the
afternoon
of
the
third
day
they
began
to
talk
of
returning
to
camp
they
took
supper
with
asa
that
night
and
as
soon
as
darkness
came
to
conceal
their
movements
they
set
out
for
the
works
hoping
to
creep
by
the
sentries
and
reach
the
shelter
of
their
tents
without
arousing
anybody
thus
winding
up
their
exploits
in
the
most
approved
style
but
they
did
not
get
into
the
camp
as
easily
as
they
thought
they
would
while
they
were
passing
through
a
piece
of
thick
woods
on
their
way
to
the
bridge
they
were
suddenly
surrounded
by
a
multitude
of
dark
forms
which
seemed
to
rise
out
of
the
ground
on
all
sides
of
them
and
before
they
could
resist
or
cry
out
they
were
seized
by
strong
hands
and
hurried
away
through
the
darkness

squad
halt
no
it
was
thursday
afternoon
and
the
relief
was
going
its
rounds
when
his
number
was
called
bert
gordon
stepped
forward
and
holding
his
musket
at
arms
port
prepared
to
receive
the
orders
which
the
sentry
whom
he
was
about
to
relieve
had
to
pass
while
the
two
corporals
stood
by
and
listened
my
instructions
are
to
stop
anybody
who
may
attempt
to
go
out
of
the
lines
without
a
pass
and
to
keep
a
good
lookout
for
prowlers
said
the
sentry
for
prowlers
echoed
bert
what
is
the
meaning
of
that
order
i
give
it
up
replied
the
sentry
i
pass
the
command
to
you
just
as
it
was
given
to
me
if
you
see
anybody
prowling
about
on
the
other
side
of
the
creek
call
the
the
sentry
fell
into
place
in
the
rear
of
the
squad
and
the
relief
passed
on
leaving
bert
alone
on
his
post
prowlers
he
repeated
over
and
over
again
i
don
t
understand
it
why
should
there
be
any
more
danger
from
prowlers
now
than
at
any
other
time
o
he
added
an
idea
suddenly
occurring
to
him
perhaps
they
think
that
don
and
egan
will
try
to
work
their
way
back
to
camp
this
afternoon
well
if
they
do
they
ll
not
get
by
so
saying
bert
settled
his
musket
firmly
on
his
shoulder
and
began
pacing
his
beat
casting
suspicious
and
searching
glances
now
and
then
toward
the
bushes
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
creek
when
bert
first
learned
that
his
brother
and
egan
had
deserted
the
camp
he
was
almost
overwhelmed
with
surprise
and
mortification
he
supposed
they
had
committed
a
serious
offence
one
that
would
be
sure
to
bring
disgrace
and
punishment
upon
them
and
took
it
so
much
to
heart
that
the
boys
were
obliged
to
explain
matters
to
him
they
assured
him
that
the
deserters
had
not
lowered
their
standing
or
forfeited
the
of
the
teachers
and
that
all
they
had
to
do
to
make
heroes
of
themselves
was
to
outrun
or
outwit
the
parties
that
were
sent
in
pursuit
of
them
and
make
their
way
back
to
camp
without
being
caught
they
are
heroes
already
said
one
of
the
students
with
great
enthusiasm
for
didn
t
they
swim
the
creek
during
their
flight
that
s
something
that
none
of
the
fellows
ever
did
before
i
wish
they
might
get
back
all
right
but
the
superintendent
has
sent
mack
after
them
and
he
s
a
bad
one
he
s
bound
to
catch
this
seemed
to
be
the
opinion
of
all
the
students
and
consequently
when
corporal
mack
returned
to
camp
and
reported
that
he
had
found
don
gordon
at
the
show
disguised
as
a
country
boy
and
had
actually
had
his
hand
on
his
collar
and
don
had
broken
away
and
beaten
him
in
a
fair
race
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
he
was
incumbered
by
heavy
boots
that
were
many
sizes
too
large
for
the
corporal
reported
all
this
the
boys
were
not
a
little
surprised
it
would
have
made
you
laugh
to
see
him
said
the
corporal
who
had
the
greatest
respect
for
the
boy
who
had
so
neatly
outwitted
him
he
looked
and
acted
so
much
like
a
born
simpleton
that
i
couldn
t
make
up
my
mind
that
it
was
don
gordon
until
he
revealed
his
identity
by
walking
like
a
then
i
knew
in
a
moment
that
he
was
the
fellow
i
wanted
and
i
didn
t
get
him
but
i
have
got
him
if
i
hadn
t
been
recalled
he
had
a
suit
of
asa
peter
s
clothes
on
and
i
had
asa
s
house
guarded
so
that
he
couldn
t
get
his
why
he
had
been
recalled
so
soon
and
at
a
time
too
when
he
had
the
deserters
just
where
he
wanted
them
the
corporal
could
not
imagine
and
neither
could
the
rest
of
the
students
understand
why
their
liberty
had
been
stopped
so
suddenly
on
the
day
following
that
on
which
the
railroad
show
had
pitched
its
tent
in
bridgeport
all
passes
had
been
refused
and
since
that
time
no
one
had
been
outside
the
gates
except
the
they
were
permitted
to
go
to
the
spring
three
times
every
day
and
they
always
went
under
guard
too
such
a
regulation
had
never
been
established
before
and
the
students
were
at
a
loss
to
know
the
meaning
of
it
it
s
all
gordon
s
fault
and
egan
s
said
one
of
the
boys
they
have
shown
that
a
fellow
can
desert
under
the
eye
of
a
sentry
if
he
sees
fit
to
do
so
and
the
superintendent
is
afraid
that
some
of
us
will
follow
their
example
that
s
the
reason
he
sends
a
guard
with
the
when
they
go
to
the
spring
after
there
s
where
you
are
mistaken
said
one
of
the
sergeants
in
reply
we
are
in
the
enemy
s
the
boys
who
were
standing
around
laughed
uproariously
and
turning
on
their
heels
walked
away
they
had
heard
quite
enough
of
such
talk
as
that
and
wanted
to
know
some
good
reason
for
the
stopping
of
their
liberty
while
bert
gordon
paced
his
beat
on
this
particular
afternoon
he
kept
one
eye
directed
toward
the
bushes
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
creek
and
the
other
turned
toward
the
camp
the
huge
tent
that
had
been
erected
the
day
before
for
the
accommodation
of
visitors
was
already
pretty
well
filled
and
from
his
lofty
perch
on
the
embankment
bert
could
see
his
strolling
about
in
company
with
their
parents
or
with
their
brothers
and
sisters
who
had
come
hundreds
of
miles
to
see
the
students
in
their
summer
quarters
every
now
and
then
one
of
the
village
hacks
would
drive
in
at
the
south
gate
and
deposit
a
load
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
before
the
door
of
the
superintendent
s
marquee
every
train
that
steamed
up
to
the
station
brought
a
fresh
influx
of
visitors
and
finally
the
camp
began
to
present
quite
a
holiday
appearance
don
t
i
wish
that
my
father
and
mother
were
among
them
thought
bert
who
began
to
feel
lonely
when
he
saw
that
almost
every
boy
who
was
off
duty
had
hastened
to
the
tent
to
receive
some
relative
or
friend
who
had
come
there
to
see
him
if
they
didn
t
live
so
far
away
they
would
certainly
be
here
but
as
it
bert
suddenly
stopped
and
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
looked
intently
at
something
on
the
other
side
of
the
creek
he
was
certain
that
the
bushes
toward
which
he
directed
his
gaze
were
suddenly
and
violently
agitated
as
if
some
heavy
body
were
working
its
way
through
them
a
moment
later
something
that
looked
like
a
head
crowned
with
feathers
was
thrust
cautiously
into
view
then
a
dark
brown
face
appeared
and
a
pair
of
glittering
eyes
looked
straight
at
him
what
in
the
world
is
that
muttered
bert
after
he
had
winked
hard
and
looked
again
to
make
sure
that
he
had
not
been
deceived
it
can
t
be
a
head
and
a
head
and
nothing
else
corporal
of
the
guard
no
the
head
or
whatever
it
was
bobbed
down
out
of
sight
in
an
instant
and
presently
the
corporal
came
hurrying
up
there
s
something
or
other
over
there
in
the
bushes
began
bert
in
response
to
the
officer
s
inquiries
and
it
looked
like
a
head
with
feathers
on
it
i
suppose
interrupted
the
corporal
with
some
impatience
in
his
tones
i
don
t
see
what
is
the
matter
with
everybody
this
afternoon
you
are
the
third
one
who
has
called
me
out
for
but
i
didn
t
call
you
out
for
nothing
protested
bert
my
eyes
never
went
back
on
me
yet
and
i
know
that
there
is
somebody
over
there
in
the
i
don
t
dispute
that
it
is
probably
your
brother
or
egan
who
is
watching
for
a
chance
to
creep
by
some
of
you
but
they
wouldn
t
have
feathers
on
their
heads
would
they
demanded
bert
o
get
out
exclaimed
the
corporal
you
didn
t
see
any
feathers
you
only
dreamed
do
you
suppose
that
i
have
been
asleep
cried
bert
it
looks
like
it
for
i
declare
i
don
t
see
how
any
boy
who
is
wide
well
have
it
your
own
way
said
the
corporal
who
noticed
that
bert
s
cheek
began
to
flush
and
his
eye
to
sparkle
as
if
he
were
growing
indignant
just
keep
your
eye
on
him
and
see
that
he
doesn
t
get
into
camp
that
s
all
you
ve
got
to
do
but
i
say
gordon
we
are
in
for
a
good
time
are
we
not
did
you
ever
see
so
many
visitors
before
i
never
did
answered
bert
this
is
my
first
camp
you
well
fellows
who
have
been
here
during
four
camps
say
that
they
never
saw
such
a
crowd
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings
continued
the
corporal
our
friends
generally
put
in
an
appearance
a
day
or
two
before
we
break
camp
and
stay
with
us
during
the
examination
and
over
commencement
and
what
it
was
that
brought
them
here
so
early
in
the
day
this
year
i
can
t
imagine
but
we
are
glad
to
see
them
all
the
same
and
we
re
going
to
have
a
smashing
hop
some
of
the
fellows
have
sent
to
town
for
the
you
didn
t
hear
anybody
inquiring
for
me
did
you
asked
bert
with
some
hesitation
i
did
not
in
fact
i
didn
t
hear
anybody
asked
for
i
took
time
to
kiss
my
mother
and
say
hallo
to
my
big
brother
and
that
s
all
the
visiting
i
can
do
until
i
go
off
duty
but
don
t
call
me
out
to
look
at
any
more
feathers
unless
you
can
show
them
to
i
saw
them
i
know
i
did
said
bert
to
himself
as
the
sentry
walked
away
no
one
can
make
me
believe
that
i
could
be
so
badly
fooled
in
broad
daylight
i
wish
i
could
have
another
look
at
once
more
bert
turned
his
eyes
toward
the
opposite
bank
of
the
stream
but
the
head
with
the
crown
of
feathers
did
not
again
show
itself
and
he
finally
resumed
his
walk
feeling
very
lonely
and
homesick
almost
every
boy
in
camp
had
fact
he
could
not
see
a
single
student
wandering
about
no
one
had
been
heard
to
ask
for
him
he
would
have
been
glad
to
see
anybody
from
rochdale
even
the
sight
of
dan
evans
s
face
would
have
been
most
welcome
bert
stood
his
time
out
without
seeing
anything
more
of
the
feathers
and
finally
the
relief
came
around
having
stacked
their
muskets
in
the
the
sentries
some
of
whom
had
received
notice
of
the
arrival
of
their
friends
scattered
in
all
directions
leaving
bert
alone
he
strolled
slowly
along
the
street
lifting
his
cap
whenever
he
met
a
accompanied
by
his
mother
or
sister
and
finally
reached
the
door
of
his
own
tent
which
was
crowded
with
the
relatives
and
friends
of
his
he
was
about
to
pass
on
with
a
word
of
apology
when
a
lady
whom
he
did
not
see
until
that
moment
arose
from
the
in
which
she
was
sitting
and
a
second
later
bert
was
clasped
in
the
arms
of
his
mother
general
gordon
was
there
too
he
had
been
visiting
with
his
old
friend
and
preceptor
the
superintendent
and
was
now
looking
over
the
fortifications
in
company
with
egan
hopkins
and
curtis
all
of
whom
were
veteran
soldiers
he
came
into
the
tent
in
a
few
minutes
and
when
he
had
greeted
bert
warmly
he
asked
for
don
i
m
sorry
to
say
that
i
don
t
know
where
he
is
replied
bert
who
then
went
on
to
give
a
hurried
history
of
don
s
exploits
at
the
show
as
reported
by
corporal
mack
gordon
listened
with
a
shade
of
anxiety
on
her
face
but
the
general
laughed
heartily
boys
will
be
boys
said
he
and
so
long
as
don
doesn
t
break
any
of
the
rules
of
the
school
or
carry
his
fun
too
far
where
is
the
harm
the
superintendent
thinks
that
he
and
egan
have
played
their
parts
as
deserters
very
well
and
i
think
so
too
i
should
like
very
much
to
see
him
but
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
wait
until
he
gets
ready
to
come
you
will
not
go
home
until
you
do
see
him
will
you
said
bert
o
no
we
shall
not
return
to
mississippi
until
you
and
don
can
go
with
us
and
then
we
shall
have
company
young
egan
hopkins
and
curtis
are
to
spend
a
month
at
our
house
i
have
just
been
talking
with
their
fathers
about
bert
was
delighted
to
hear
that
this
matter
had
been
definitely
settled
and
he
wished
that
don
had
been
there
to
hear
it
too
he
little
dreamed
that
his
brother
and
egan
who
were
at
that
very
moment
laying
their
plans
for
getting
into
camp
were
destined
to
be
waylaid
and
taken
captive
by
those
who
had
every
reason
for
holding
fast
to
them
but
such
was
the
fact
as
bert
was
to
be
off
duty
until
midnight
he
had
ample
opportunity
to
visit
with
his
father
and
mother
he
walked
about
the
fortifications
with
them
told
them
amusing
and
interesting
stories
of
his
life
at
the
academy
and
ate
supper
with
them
in
the
big
tent
when
all
had
satisfied
their
appetites
with
the
good
things
that
had
been
provided
for
them
the
tables
were
taken
out
the
chinese
lanterns
that
hung
suspended
from
the
wires
overhead
were
lighted
the
music
struck
up
and
the
dancing
began
everybody
young
and
old
seemed
bent
on
having
a
good
time
and
the
fun
grew
fast
and
furious
for
an
hour
everything
passed
off
smoothly
and
then
there
came
a
most
unexpected
and
alarming
ringing
report
of
a
musket
followed
it
made
the
cold
chills
creep
over
every
one
who
heard
it
the
music
ceased
and
the
dancers
stood
still
in
their
places
and
looked
at
one
another
there
was
a
moment
s
hush
and
then
a
whole
chorus
of
yells
such
as
no
one
in
that
company
had
ever
heard
before
rang
out
on
the
still
air
they
seemed
to
come
from
all
sides
of
the
camp
and
their
effect
was
most
startling
the
ladies
screamed
and
ran
to
their
husbands
for
protection
the
gentlemen
stood
irresolute
each
one
gazing
inquiringly
into
the
face
of
his
neighbor
and
the
students
were
thrown
into
a
stupor
from
which
they
were
quickly
aroused
by
the
roll
of
the
drum
and
loud
cries
of
fall
in
fall
in
o
my
boy
you
mustn
t
go
out
there
exclaimed
gordon
as
bert
dashed
forward
to
obey
the
order
her
face
was
very
white
and
she
clung
to
her
husband
for
support
let
him
go
said
the
general
if
he
has
any
pluck
at
all
now
is
the
time
for
him
to
show
he
did
not
know
what
the
matter
were
few
in
that
camp
who
he
was
a
soldier
when
he
was
in
the
service
he
had
yielded
prompt
and
willing
obedience
to
every
order
given
him
by
his
superiors
no
matter
how
great
the
danger
he
might
incur
by
so
doing
and
he
wanted
his
boys
to
do
the
same
thing
bert
proved
that
he
had
inherited
a
goodly
share
of
his
father
s
courage
for
although
he
was
badly
frightened
he
lost
not
a
moment
in
obeying
the
order
to
fall
in
he
ran
into
the
and
seized
his
musket
but
to
his
great
surprise
he
found
that
the
bayonet
that
belonged
to
it
was
gone
in
fact
the
bayonets
were
all
gone
and
the
pieces
were
stacked
by
the
ramrods
utterly
at
a
loss
how
to
account
for
this
bert
caught
up
the
weapon
and
ran
to
join
his
company
which
was
forming
on
the
street
in
front
of
its
own
tents
fall
in
commanded
the
boy
captain
right
dress
order
arms
bayonets
these
orders
were
promptly
except
the
last
when
the
young
soldiers
came
to
feel
for
their
bayonets
they
discovered
that
their
scabbards
were
empty
before
anybody
could
ask
the
meaning
of
this
an
orderly
hurried
up
with
instructions
for
the
captain
to
move
his
company
by
the
left
flank
and
take
up
a
position
in
reserve
so
as
to
protect
the
big
tent
and
its
occupants
all
this
while
those
hideous
yells
had
been
arising
on
all
sides
and
now
they
were
accompanied
by
the
discharge
of
these
discharges
rapidly
increased
in
number
and
frequency
until
it
seemed
as
if
the
camp
were
surrounded
by
a
wall
of
flame
and
still
nobody
knew
what
was
the
matter
as
bert
s
company
wheeled
into
position
the
first
company
went
by
moving
at
double
time
and
disappeared
in
the
darkness
and
a
few
moments
later
rapid
platoon
firing
sounded
in
the
direction
of
the
bridge
then
the
students
began
to
understand
the
matter
it
s
a
sham
fight
said
the
boy
who
stood
at
bert
s
elbow
but
who
are
our
assailants
asked
the
latter
who
was
greatly
relieved
that
was
a
question
the
boy
could
not
answer
but
bert
was
able
to
answer
it
for
himself
a
few
minutes
later
the
fight
at
the
bridge
increased
in
fury
and
the
first
company
finding
its
position
there
untenable
was
ordered
to
fall
back
so
that
the
artillery
could
have
a
chance
to
come
into
play
encouraged
by
this
retrograde
movement
the
enemy
rushed
across
the
bridge
in
overwhelming
numbers
pressing
the
young
soldiers
so
closely
that
the
retreat
which
was
begun
in
good
order
very
speedily
became
a
rout
the
old
german
professor
highly
excited
ran
up
sword
in
hand
and
made
frantic
appeals
to
them
to
stand
their
ground
and
defend
the
gate
but
the
ranks
were
hopelessly
broken
they
came
through
the
tents
and
took
refuge
behind
bert
s
company
the
members
of
which
were
thunderstruck
what
kind
of
an
enemy
was
it
anyhow
they
asked
themselves
that
could
throw
the
boys
of
the
first
class
into
such
confusion
as
this
young
shentlemens
exclaimed
the
professor
flourishing
his
sword
angrily
over
his
head
i
been
ashamed
of
you
such
fighting
is
von
grand
disgrace
to
the
pridgebort
military
academy
captain
bumroy
he
added
turning
to
the
commander
of
bert
s
company
go
ahead
and
sweep
the
enemy
from
the
face
of
the
earth
make
good
piziness
captain
pomeroy
and
his
men
went
about
this
work
as
if
they
were
in
earnest
holding
their
muskets
at
arms
port
they
advanced
in
good
order
and
when
they
reached
the
end
of
their
company
street
they
found
out
who
the
enemy
were
they
were
indians
hideously
painted
and
dressed
in
all
sorts
of
odd
costumes
they
had
gained
a
footing
inside
the
works
and
were
engaged
in
pulling
down
the
tents
preparatory
to
carrying
them
off
excited
as
bert
was
he
could
nevertheless
calmly
recall
some
of
the
incidents
of
the
afternoon
now
i
know
the
meaning
of
that
order
regarding
prowlers
said
he
to
himself
i
see
somebody
in
the
bushes
with
feathers
on
his
head
and
it
was
one
of
these
indians
who
was
reconnoitering
our
being
interrupted
in
the
work
of
stealing
the
tents
the
indians
advanced
in
a
body
brandishing
their
weapons
and
yelling
with
all
the
power
of
their
lungs
they
hoped
no
doubt
to
frighten
captain
pomeroy
and
his
men
create
a
panic
among
them
and
having
scattered
them
to
take
some
of
them
prisoners
but
in
this
they
failed
the
boys
were
so
very
much
in
earnest
and
so
fully
determined
to
save
their
tents
that
they
came
very
near
changing
the
sham
fight
into
a
real
fight
now
captain
pomeroy
saw
why
it
was
that
the
teachers
had
taken
the
precaution
to
remove
the
bayonets
if
his
men
had
been
provided
with
those
dangerous
weapons
he
would
have
charged
the
indians
without
an
instant
s
hesitation
and
there
was
no
telling
what
the
young
soldiers
might
have
done
in
their
excitement
steady
commanded
the
boy
captain

the

the
order
was
obeyed
with
the
greatest
alacrity
raising
a
yell
the
boys
rushed
upon
the
indians
and
if
the
latter
had
stood
their
ground
there
would
have
been
a
fight
sure
but
fortunately
they
broke
and
ran
the
captain
followed
them
as
far
as
the
gate
and
then
drawing
his
men
up
in

opened
a
hot
fire
of
blank
cartridges
on

had
kept
a

on
the

aha
now
stay
here
and
don

let
them
red
fellows
come
in
some
meanwhile
the
rest
of
the
battalion
had
not
been
idle
the
battery
had
been
in
almost
constant
use
the
first
platoon
of
the
second
company
had
successfully
defended
the
south
gate
and
the
second
platoon
assisted
by
the
third
company
had
held
the
rest
of
the
works
repulsing
every
charge
that
had
been
made
upon
them
the
artillery
roared
small
arms
popped
the
threatening
of
the
indians
were
answered
by
yells
of
defiance
from
the
boy
short
there
was
nothing
wanting
to
make
a
real
fight
of
it
except
bullets
and
bayonets
this
state
of
affairs
continued
for
half
an
hour
during
which
the
different
companies
were
handled
just
as
they
would
have
been
in
action
and
then
the
firing
ceased
as
suddenly
as
it
had
begun
the
battle
was
over
just
then
an
orderly
from
headquarters
stepped
up
and
saluted
captain
pomeroy
the
superintendent
presents
his
compliments
and
requests
that
you
will
keep
a
lookout
for
a
delegation
from
the
indian
camp
said
he
should
any
appear
you
will
receive
it
and
send
it
to
the
big
tent
under
the
young
captain
at
once
detailed
a
corporal
s
guard
to
wait
at
the
bridge
and
escort
the
expected
delegation
inside
the
lines
and
scarcely
had
the
squad
disappeared
before
it
came
in
again
accompanied
by
half
a
dozen
stately
indians
who
were
closely
wrapped
up
in
their
blankets
they
were
fellows
in
spite
of
their
feathers
and
paint
and
if
they
had
been
entering
a
hostile
camp
they
could
not
have
behaved
with
more
dignity
and
seriousness
what
do
you
want
demanded
captain
pomeroy
want
to
see
big
chief
grunted
one
of
the
indians
in
reply
have
you
any
weapons
about
you
inquired
the
captain
recalling
the
stratagem
to
which
pontiac
resorted
when
he
tried
to
capture
detroit
the
indians
shook
their
heads
but
the
captain
as
in
duty
bound
ordered
them
to
be
searched
after
which
he
told
his
first
lieutenant
to
take
command
of
the
squad
and
to
conduct
the
visitors
to
the
big
tent
then
as
there
was
no
danger
to
be
apprehended
so
long
as
the
delegation
was
in
camp
he
placed
a
guard
at
the
gate
and
allowed
the
rest
of
his
men
to
stack
arms
and
sit
down
on
the
grass
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
two
of
the
indians
came
back
guarded
by
the
lieutenant
and
his
squad
and
accompanied
by
the
officer
of
the
day
captain
pomeroy
said
the
latter
pass
these
two
chiefs
and
stand
ready
to
receive
them
when
they
very
good
sir
replied
the
captain
what
did
they
do
in
the
big
tent
perkins
he
asked
of
his
lieutenant
as
soon
as
the
officer
of
the
day
had
retired
and
who
are
they
any
way
why
they
are
mount
pleasant
indians
answered
the
lieutenant
who
during
his
absence
had
had
opportunity
to
talk
with
some
of
the
boys
in
the
first
class
who
knew
all
about
the
matter
they
are
principally
farmers
and
mechanics
but
there
are
one
or
two
professional
men
among
teachers
and
the
well
i
declare
exclaimed
the
captain
they
haven
t
forgotten
how
to
give
the
if
they
are
civilized
have
they
of
course
this
night
s
work
was
a
job
certainly
it
was
the
superintendent
wanted
to
do
something
to
amuse
us
so
he
went
out
to
their
reservation
which
is
about
twenty
miles
from
here
and
easily
induced
the
to
promise
to
bring
in
three
hundred
of
his
young
men
on
a
certain
night
and
make
an
attack
on
us
then
he
wrote
to
our
parents
and
that
s
what
brought
this
crowd
here
ah
that
explains
it
but
they
didn
t
know
anything
about
it
for
i
noticed
that
some
of
them
were
as
frightened
as
we
were
didn
t
you
hear
the
women
scream
i
thought
the
girl
i
was
dancing
with
was
going
to
faint
she
turned
so
white
what
did
they
do
in
the
big
tent
o
they
held
a
there
in
the
presence
of
all
our
guests
smoking
a
pipe
and
going
through
all
the
motions
of
a
regular
indian
peace
commission
the
chief
made
a
speech
i
tell
you
it
was
a
good
one
and
astonished
everybody
during
which
he
said
that
his
young
men
had
taken
some
prisoners
whom
he
would
be
happy
to
prisoners
repeated
the
captain
incredulously
yes
eight
of
the
boys
are
missing
you
see
this
company
was
thrown
into
confusion
when
they
fell
back
from
the
bridge
and
as
soon
as
they
became
separated
the
indians
jumped
in
and
dragged
some
of
them
well
they
didn
t
serve
me
that
way
said
captain
pomeroy
with
an
air
of
triumph
they
had
the
impudence
to
try
to
steal
my
boys
tents
but
when
we
turned
butts
to
the
front
didn
t
they
dig
out
in
a
hurry
lieutenant
perkins
who
had
borne
his
full
part
in
that
gallant
charge
said
he
thought
they
did
chapter
xiv
don
gordon
s
well
what
did
the
chief
say
about
the
prisoners
asked
captain
pomeroy
after
a
moment
s
pause
o
he
went
through
the
usual
formula
answered
lieutenant
perkins
he
said
he
would
be
happy
to
surrender
his
captives
if
the
white
chief
would
give
him
and
his
warriors
presents
enough
to
make
it
an
object
for
him
to
do
so
the
superintendent
said
he
wouldn
t
do
that
but
if
the
chief
would
give
up
the
prisoners
and
come
into
camp
afternoon
and
dance
for
us
he
would
furnish
him
and
his
warriors
with
all
the
grub
they
could
eat
the
chief
finally
accepted
the
offer
and
those
two
indians
who
went
out
a
little
while
ago
are
to
bring
in
the
who
comes
there
shouted
the
sentry
at
the
bridge
there
they
are
now
exclaimed
the
lieutenant
corporal
go
out
the
corporal
went
and
presently
returned
accompanied
by
the
two
indians
and
ten
prisoners
instead
of
eight
bert
and
his
companions
moved
up
close
to
the
gate
to
see
who
the
prisoners
were
and
the
former
was
astonished
beyond
measure
to
find
that
his
brother
and
sergeant
egan
were
marching
with
the
squad
the
boys
wanted
to
laugh
at
them
but
they
were
on
duty
and
they
knew
that
such
a
breach
of
discipline
would
not
be
allowed
led
by
lieutenant
perkins
and
his
squad
they
were
marched
to
the
big
tent
where
the
ceremony
of
surrendering
them
was
gone
through
with
after
which
the
indian
delegation
was
escorted
out
of
the
camp
captain
pomeroy
and
his
men
were
ordered
to
their
quarters
the
sentries
were
posted
the
ranks
broken
and
all
the
young
soldiers
who
were
off
duty
flocked
into
the
big
tent
to
talk
over
the
incidents
of
the
fight
with
their
guests
bert
quickly
found
his
way
to
a
merry
group
consisting
of
his
father
mother
and
brother
and
egan
hopkins
and
curtis
with
their
fathers
and
mothers
all
of
whom
were
listening
with
interest
to
what
the
deserters
had
to
say
regarding
their
experience
among
the
indians
when
they
had
finished
their
story
general
gordon
said
you
missed
it
boys
the
members
of
your
company
covered
themselves
with
glory
and
you
have
no
share
in
it
the
first
company
was
so
badly
demoralized
by
the
very
first
charge
the
indians
made
that
they
couldn
t
be
rallied
while
pomeroy
with
his
raw
recruits
as
you
might
call
them
drove
the
enemy
from
the
field
and
saved
the
tents
from
it
was
really
thrilling
gordon
said
egan
s
pretty
sister
to
whom
don
had
just
been
introduced
and
i
never
before
was
so
badly
frightened
we
were
not
expecting
anything
of
the
kind
you
know
and
i
could
not
imagine
what
the
matter
i
wouldn
t
have
had
those
indians
get
their
hands
on
us
for
anything
exclaimed
egan
who
seemed
to
take
the
matter
very
much
to
heart
i
knew
the
fight
was
coming
and
i
wanted
very
much
to
take
part
in
it
well
it
serves
me
right
for
deserting
when
i
ought
to
have
stayed
in
it
was
growing
late
late
that
the
dancing
was
not
resumed
the
carriages
which
had
been
ordered
for
eleven
o
clock
began
to
arrive
and
the
guests
to
take
their
departure
for
bridgeport
whose
two
hotels
and
numerous
were
taxed
to
the
utmost
to
find
room
for
them
the
next
morning
passes
were
granted
by
wholesale
and
every
boy
who
was
able
to
secure
one
started
at
once
for
the
indian
camp
which
was
located
in
a
deep
ravine
about
a
mile
away
the
young
braves
drove
a
thriving
trade
in
bows
and
arrows
and
earned
a
snug
sum
of
pocket
money
by
shooting
dimes
and
quarters
out
of
split
sticks
while
the
squaws
sold
moccasins
beaded
purses
and
miniature
canoes
by
the
bushel
at
one
o
clock
the
big
tent
was
again
crowded
with
guests
and
an
hour
later
the
indian
warriors
who
were
all
armed
and
freshly
painted
filed
silently
into
the
works
the
entertainment
that
followed
and
which
was
much
better
than
some
the
boys
had
paid
cents
to
witness
included
the
and
a
scalping
scene
by
the
time
it
was
ended
dinner
had
been
served
in
the
big
tent
after
the
dancers
had
done
full
justice
to
it
and
had
exchanged
courtesies
with
their
late
antagonists
by
giving
an
in
return
for
their
three
cheers
and
a
tiger
they
filed
out
of
the
works
as
silently
as
they
had
come
into
them
and
the
students
once
more
settled
down
to
business
there
were
no
more
desertions
after
that
some
of
their
friends
came
to
see
them
every
day
and
as
there
were
many
veterans
among
them
who
watched
their
movements
with
a
critical
eye
of
course
the
boys
were
careful
to
perform
all
their
duties
in
a
prompt
and
manner
in
due
time
the
camp
was
broken
and
the
students
marched
back
to
the
academy
which
during
their
absence
had
been
thoroughly
renovated
the
examination
was
held
the
members
of
the
first
class
received
their
degrees
and
new
officers
were
appointed
for
the
coming
year
among
the
latter
were
bert
gordon
and
sam
former
being
made
first
sergeant
of
the
fourth
company
which
was
yet
to
be
organized
and
the
other
receiving
a
warrant
as
second
corporal
don
gordon
stood
head
and
shoulders
above
everybody
in
his
class
and
the
only
thing
that
prevented
him
from
being
commissioned
lieutenant
of
the
new
company
was
his
record
as
a
soldier
which
as
we
know
was
by
no
means
perfect
contrary
to
dick
henderson
s
prediction
the
school
had
not
been
disgraced
by
the
presence
of
the
new
york
its
popularity
seemed
to
be
increasing
for
the
number
of
those
who
applied
for
admission
was
greater
than
it
had
ever
been
before
and
when
the
examination
was
over
bert
found
that
he
had
a
hundred
and
ten
names
on
his
company
roster
dick
would
not
have
made
such
a
prediction
now
for
he
was
different
in
every
way
from
the
boy
we
introduced
to
the
reader
at
the
beginning
of
this
story
having
got
out
from
under
clarence
duncan
s
baneful
influence
and
having
don
gordon
s
example
and
tom
fisher
s
to
encourage
him
he
was
in
a
fair
way
to
make
a
man
of
himself
at
length
the
exercises
were
all
ended
and
one
bright
morning
hopkins
egan
and
curtis
took
leave
of
their
friends
and
in
company
with
don
and
bert
gordon
and
their
parents
set
out
for
rochdale
they
went
fully
prepared
to
enjoy
themselves
as
soon
as
it
was
settled
that
they
were
to
go
home
with
the
gordons
they
had
written
for
their
hunting
rigs
which
were
duly
forwarded
to
them
walter
curtis
s
favorite
in
fact
his
only
weapon
was
a
light
stevens
rifle
with
which
he
had
broken
out
of
glass
balls
thrown
from
a
revolving
trap
hopkins
took
pride
in
a
short
shotgun
of
large
calibre
that
he
had
often
used
on
horseback
while
following
deer
and
foxes
to
the
music
of
the
hounds
while
egan
who
lived
on
the
eastern
shore
of
maryland
where
and
abound
put
all
his
faith
in
a
ponderous
parker
which
was
so
heavy
that
don
gordon
strong
and
enduring
as
he
was
declared
that
he
wouldn
t
carry
it
all
day
through
the
woods
if
his
friend
egan
would
make
him
a
present
of
it
neither
would
i
chimed
in
hopkins
you
exclaimed
egan
standing
off
and
looking
at
the
speaker
s
rotund
figure
you
d
look
nice
starting
out
for
an
tramp
you
would
your
legs
are
too
short
and
you
carry
too
much
weight
around
with
you
you
would
get
out
of
breath
before
you
had
gone
half
a
mile
but
as
i
am
not
going
to
mississippi
after
squirrels
i
don
t
intend
to
tramp
about
the
woods
gordon
promised
me
some
as
for
myself
curtis
remarked
i
always
did
despise
a
a
blind
man
ought
to
be
able
to
hit
a
duck
by
sending
a
pound
or
two
of
shot
at
well
it
s
not
so
easy
either
interrupted
egan
a
duck
when
flying
down
wind
moves
at
the
rate
of
ninety
miles
an
hour
old
fellow
and
it
takes
the
best
kind
of
a
marksman
to
make
a
good
a
true
sportsman
never
prides
himself
upon
the
number
of
birds
he
kills
but
upon
the
superiority
of
his
shots
said
curtis
when
you
can
strike
a
rapidly
moving
object
with
a
single
ball
from
a
rifle
then
you
can
boast
of
your
during
the
journey
down
the
mississippi
the
boys
were
on
deck
almost
all
the
time
listening
to
don
who
pointed
out
the
various
places
of
interest
along
the
route
adding
some
entertaining
scraps
of
the
history
of
each
over
there
on
the
right
bank
he
said
was
the
of
belmont
and
on
the
opposite
shore
was
columbus
from
which
came
the
confederate
reinforcements
that
had
turned
the
union
victory
into
defeat
this
was
island

where
the
gunboat
cincinnati
distinguished
herself
by
running
the
batteries
and
a
young
master

mate
afterward
the
brave
commander
of
the
champion
won
his
by
going
ashore
with
a
boat

crew
spiking
some
of
the
guns
and
bringing
off
the
wipers
and
spongers
that
belonged
to
them
over
there
on
the
bluff
was
fort

where
that
terrible
massacre
took
place
under
forrest
and
this
was
memphis
the
scene
of
the
fight
between
the
union
and
confederate
fleets
which
resulted
in
the
utter
defeat
of
the
latter
and
in
the
capture
of

here

at
last
it

a
history
too
don

and
he
promised
that
he
would
relate
it
when
they
reached
the
egan
and
hopkins
were
southern
boys
and
consequently
life
on
a
plantation
was
not
new
to
them
but
curtis
who
was
from
new
england
found
much
to
interest
him
and
showed
himself
to
be
a
true
yankee
by
asking
a
thousand
and
one
questions
about
everything
he
saw
hopkins
s
first
exploit
was
riding
a
kicking
mule
that
fred
and
joe
packard
brought
out
for
him
to
try
his
skill
upon
to
the
surprise
of
everybody
hopkins
mounted
in
regular
texas
style
placing
his
left
hand
on
the
mule
s
shoulder
and
throwing
his
right
leg
over
his
back
the
moment
he
was
firmly
settled
his
appearance
changed
as
if
by
magic
his
seat
was
easy
and
graceful
and
he
kept
his
place
on
that
mule
s
back
with
as
little
trouble
as
he
would
have
kept
his
place
in
a
rocking
chair
the
animal
could
not
move
him
an
inch
with
all
his
kicking
and
plunging
the
performance
effectually
silenced
egan
who
was
himself
a
fine
horseman
and
he
never
had
anything
to
say
about
hopkins
s
riding
after
that
the
ducks
geese
swans
and
brant
were
already
beginning
to
come
into
the
lake
and
on
the
morning
of
the
third
day
following
their
arrival
at
the
plantation
the
young
hunters
fred
and
joe
packard
being
included
among
the
number
made
ready
to
take
up
their
abode
at
the
the
canoe
and
both
of
which
had
been
securely
housed
during
the
absence
of
their
owners
were
put
into
the
water
and
loaded
to
their
utmost
capacity
with
bedding
provisions
and
camp
furniture
there
was
just
room
enough
left
in
the
canoe
to
accommodate
old
cuff
the
negro
who
was
to
act
as
cook
and
during
their
sojourn
at
the
and
when
all
the
boys
and
don
s
two
pointers
had
crowded
into
the
the
little
craft
seemed
on
the
point
of
sinking
as
an
irishman
would
have
remarked
if
the
water
in
the
lake
had
been
two
inches
higher
she
would
have
gone
to
the
bottom
beyond
a
doubt
we
ve
got
about
three
hundred
pounds
too
much
cargo
aboard
said
curtis
in
his
quiet
way
hop
suppose
you
get
out
and
go
afoot
there
s
a
good
make
egan
throw
his
artillery
overboard
and
we
shall
get
on
well
enough
retorted
hopkins
that
s
what
makes
the
boat
sink
so
deep
in
the
with
much
fun
and
chaffing
the
boys
pulled
toward
the
point
on
which
the
was
located
and
by
handling
their
heavily
loaded
craft
in
the
most
careful
manner
they
succeeded
in
beaching
her
in
safety
as
her
bow
touched
the
shore
old
cuff
who
landed
at
the
same
moment
uttered
an
exclamation
indicative
of
the
greatest
astonishment
don
looked
up
and
saw
that
the
was
already
occupied
a
smoke
was
curling
out
of
the
that
served
for
a
chimney
and
a
man
dressed
in
a
tattered
suit
of
brown
jeans
stood
in
front
of
the
open
door
leaning
on
his
axe
from
the
cabin
there
came
the
sound
of
voices
mingled
with
another
sound
that
made
old
cuff
almost
ready
to
boil
over
with
indignation
fore
moses
don
he
exclaimed
somebody
in
dar
crackin
all
de
nuts
dat
i
done
pick
up
for
you
an
your
frien
we
ll
soon
put
a
stop
to
that
answered
don
those
people
whoever
they
are
have
no
business
in
there
and
they
must
get
out
at
did
you
ever
hear
of
such
impudence
exclaimed
bert
angrily
where
did
they
come
from
anyhow
they
don
t
belong
in
this
part
of
the
the
man
with
the
axe
seemed
as
much
surprised
to
see
don
and
his
party
as
the
latter
were
to
see
him
he
too
uttered
an
exclamation
which
brought
to
the
door
the
other
occupants
of
the
cabin
seven
of
them
in
all
including
two
more
men
and
three
women
and
very
disreputable
looking
persons
the
most
of
them
were
the
other
two
one
of
whom
seemed
to
be
entirely
out
of
place
there
did
not
show
themselves
at
the
door
as
openly
as
their
companions
did
and
consequently
don
and
bert
did
not
see
them
they
thrust
their
heads
out
very
cautiously
and
as
soon
as
they
saw
who
the
were
they
drew
back
and
made
all
haste
to
effect
their
escape
through
the
window
on
the
other
side
of
the
cabin
by
keeping
the
building
between
themselves
and
the
beach
they
managed
to
reach
the
cover
of
the
woods
without
being
observed
don
and
bert
would
have
been
very
much
surprised
if
they
had
seen
them
for
they
were
our
old
acquaintances
lester
brigham
and
dan
evans
they
were
now
almost
constant
companions
and
how
they
came
to
be
so
shall
be
told
further
on
illustration
squatter
sovereignty
what
do
you
want
here
demanded
the
man
with
the
axe
as
don
walked
up
the
bank
followed
by
his
companions
i
think
that
is
a
proper
question
for
me
to
ask
you
replied
don
who
did
not
at
all
like
the
surly
tone
in
which
he
had
been
addressed
this
house
belongs
to
my
brother
and
myself
and
we
would
thank
you
to
vacate
it
without
the
loss
of
a
wal
i
reckon
we
shall
do
as
we
please
about
that
drawled
one
of
the
men
who
stood
in
the
door
well
i
reckon
you
won
t
you
ll
do
as
i
please
about
it
i
want
possession
here
and
i
want
it
now
i
see
you
broke
the
lock
in
order
to
gain
admittance
and
you
had
no
business
to
do
do
you
live
here
asked
the
man
with
the
axe
i
m
going
to
live
wal
thar
s
two
rooms
in
the
shantee
an
why
can
t
take
one
of
em
an
let
we
don
t
want
company
exclaimed
don
who
was
fairly
staggered
by
the
proposition
we
want
you
to
clear
out
bag
and
baggage
and
to
be
quick
about
it
too
my
father
is
a
magistrate
and
this
is
on
his
the
word
magistrate
had
a
magical
effect
upon
the
members
of
the
dirty
group
in
the
it
put
life
into
them
and
at
the
same
time
set
the
women
s
tongues
in
motion
they
began
packing
up
their
scanty
belongings
declaring
with
much
vociferation
that
it
was
a
sin
and
a
shame
that
they
should
be
turned
out
of
such
snug
quarters
just
to
accommodate
the
whims
of
a
party
of
young
aristocrats
who
wanted
to
come
there
and
shoot
a
few
ducks
why
couldn
t
they
go
elsewhere
for
their
ducks
and
leave
honest
people
alone
that
was
always
the
way
with
rich
folks
they
didn
t
care
how
others
suffered
so
long
as
they
had
their
own
pleasure
but
it
was
a
great
comfort
to
know
that
it
wouldn
t
always
be
so
there
was
a
time
coming
and
it
wasn
t
so
very
far
distant
either
when
rich
folks
would
be
required
to
give
up
some
of
their
gains
that
sounds
like
communism
doesn
t
it
said
curtis
yes
and
sounds
very
much
like
incendiarism
answered
hopkins
and
so
it
did
for
just
then
one
of
the
men
in
the
cabin
was
heard
to
say
never
mind
luke
the
old
shantee
is
dry
an
fire
ll
burn
let
them
burn
it
if
they
dare
said
bert
his
slight
form
swelling
with
indignation
i
wouldn
t
give
a
picayune
for
the
life
of
the
person
who
attempts
it
cuff
he
added
turning
to
the
negro
as
soon
as
we
get
things
straightened
up
here
i
want
you
to
go
back
to
the
plantation
after
don
s
hounds
it
looks
now
as
though
we
should
need
the
tramps
if
such
they
were
seemed
to
be
in
no
hurry
to
leave
the
they
bundled
up
their
goods
with
great
deliberation
abusing
the
boys
roundly
all
the
while
and
finally
came
out
and
turned
their
faces
toward
the
river
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
sight
don
and
bert
began
an
investigation
of
the
premises
the
cabin
looked
as
though
it
had
been
occupied
for
a
long
time
the
wood
which
they
had
provided
for
their
own
use
was
all
gone
the
stove
had
been
copiously
bedewed
with
tobacco
juice
the
floor
was
littered
with
and
everything
was
dingy
and
smoky
we
can
t
live
in
any
such
looking
hole
as
this
said
don
in
deep
disgust
cuff
build
up
a
good
fire
put
on
the
kettle
and
scrub
out
let
s
have
things
neat
and
clean
as
they
used
to
be
bert
suppose
you
take
somebody
with
you
and
watch
those
people
and
see
where
they
go
bert
at
once
started
off
with
hopkins
for
a
companion
and
while
they
were
gone
the
others
employed
themselves
in
setting
things
to
rights
the
bones
squirrel
skins
and
turkey
feathers
that
were
scattered
about
in
front
of
the
door
were
raked
into
a
pile
and
set
on
fire
a
fresh
supply
of
was
cut
and
the
boats
were
unloaded
and
their
cargoes
piled
up
outside
of
the
cabin
in
readiness
to
be
transferred
to
the
interior
as
soon
as
the
purifying
process
had
been
completed
by
the
time
this
work
was
done
bert
and
hopkins
came
back
they
re
on
the
good
said
the
former
they
have
a
little
in
the
that
s
all
we
want
to
know
interrupted
don
they
are
thieves
and
vagabonds
of
the
first
what
makes
you
say
that
asked
curtis
what
s
a
inquired
egan
i
will
answer
the
last
question
first
said
don
a
is
simply
a
scow
or
thirty
feet
long
and
six
or
eight
feet
wide
with
a
cabin
amidships
this
cabin
takes
up
the
whole
of
the
boat
with
the
exception
of
two
or
three
feet
at
each
end
where
the
crew
stand
when
they
are
handling
the
lines
and
the
steering
oar
these
boats
are
generally
the
property
of
fishermen
and
hunters
who
float
about
looking
for
a
suitable
place
to
ply
their
occupation
for
example
there
is
a
in
the
bayou
above
mound
s
in
illinois
you
has
been
there
four
or
five
years
its
solitary
occupant
making
a
good
living
by
trapping
minks
and
raccoons
in
the
winter
and
catching
buffalo
and
catfish
the
rest
of
the
buffalo
repeated
egan
yes
i
didn
t
say
what
s
the
difference
asked
hopkins
who
although
he
was
a
splendid
was
not
very
well
posted
in
natural
history
there
s
a
good
deal
of
difference
the
first
thing
you
know
a
buffalo
is
a
fish
somewhat
resembling
a
in
shape
but
possessing
none
of
his
game
qualities
while
a
bison
is
an
but
there
are
such
animals
as
buffaloes
said
egan
yes
in
africa
and
asia
but
not
in
this
country
there
are
no
partridges
pheasants
or
wild
rabbits
here
either
as
i
was
going
on
to
say
this
man
will
probably
stay
at
mound
city
until
the
fish
and
game
begin
to
grow
scarce
and
then
he
will
paddle
his
boat
out
into
the
current
and
float
down
the
river
until
he
finds
another
place
that
suits
him
if
he
gets
hard
up
for
grub
he
will
not
hesitate
to
visit
anybody
s
or
no
honest
industrious
man
ever
lives
in
that
way
said
bert
the
planters
along
the
river
are
suspicious
of
these
and
when
they
find
one
tied
up
on
their
premises
they
always
order
it
if
these
people
had
a
shelter
of
their
own
why
did
they
take
possession
of
your
asked
egan
o
for
the
sake
of
variety
probably
answered
don
perhaps
their
house
was
too
small
for
them
or
it
may
be
that
the
roof
leaked
or
that
the
scow
was
full
of
water
they
always
like
to
live
ashore
when
they
have
the
there
was
much
to
be
done
about
the
and
the
boys
were
kept
busy
all
the
forenoon
old
cuff
grumbled
lustily
while
he
scrubbed
declaring
over
and
over
again
that
don
ought
to
set
fire
to
the
cabin
and
destroy
it
for
it
never
could
be
made
fit
for
white
folks
to
live
in
again
after
eating
a
substantial
lunch
which
was
served
under
the
trees
egan
hopkins
and
curtis
took
their
guns
and
accompanied
by
bert
and
fred
packard
strolled
along
the
shore
of
the
lake
to
see
if
they
could
find
anything
for
supper
while
don
and
joe
remained
behind
to
assist
cuff
at
his
work
when
egan
and
curtis
returned
at
dark
they
declared
that
they
were
more
than
satisfied
with
their
prospects
for
sport
the
lower
end
of
the
lake
was
full
of
ducks
they
said
and
egan
had
astonished
his
companions
by
bringing
fourteen
of
them
down
with
a
single
discharge
of
his
heavy
while
curtis
had
showed
his
skill
with
the
rifle
by
shooting
four
ducks
on
the
wing
and
killing
a
swan
at
the
distance
of
more
than
two
hundred
yards
they
were
tired
as
well
as
hungry
and
glad
to
see
the
inside
of
the
which
did
not
look
now
as
it
did
when
they
first
came
there
in
the
morning
a
cheerful
fire
was
burning
in
the
stove
which
had
been
blacked
and
polished
until
one
could
almost
see
his
face
in
it
the
room
was
brilliantly
lighted
by
two
lamps
that
were
suspended
from
the
ceiling
the
floor
was
covered
with
rugs
pictures
of
hunting
and
fishing
scenes
adorned
the
walls
and
camp
chairs
and
stools
were
scattered
about
in
the
next
apartment
which
was
used
principally
as
a
sleeping
and
the
same
scene
of
neatness
and
order
was
presented
the
wide
which
occupied
nearly
the
whole
of
one
end
of
it
was
piled
high
with
blazing
logs
and
comfortable
beds
were
made
up
in
the
bunks
there
were
pictures
on
the
walls
of
this
room
also
rugs
on
the
floor
some
of
these
rugs
at
once
attracted
the
attention
of
egan
and
his
friends
for
they
were
made
of
the
skins
of
bears
and
deer
that
had
fallen
to
don
s
rifle
and
there
were
enough
to
accommodate
all
the
boys
that
could
crowd
about
the
the
room
looked
cosey
and
comfortable
and
the
visitors
no
longer
wondered
why
it
was
that
don
thought
so
much
of
his
i
am
going
to
have
one
of
my
own
said
curtis
and
it
shall
be
modeled
after
this
one
i
shall
build
it
this
fall
so
as
to
have
it
in
readiness
to
receive
you
fellows
when
you
go
home
with
me
next
vacation
now
then
where
are
those
quails
that
hop
brought
in
can
your
darkey
serve
them
up
on
toast
in
good
shape
of
course
he
can
answered
don
no
one
can
do
it
better
but
hop
hasn
t
brought
in
any
quails
yet
where
did
you
leave
him
i
wondered
why
he
didn
t
come
home
with
hasn
t
he
returned
exclaimed
egan
then
he
s
lost
we
haven
t
seen
him
since
two
o
clock
when
he
coaxed
your
pointers
away
from
owe
him
a
grudge
for
that
for
we
wanted
the
dogs
to
stay
by
us
and
retrieve
the
ducks
we
went
over
into
a
field
after
a
flock
of
quails
he
had
marked
down
there
we
heard
him
shoot
several
times
after
that
and
as
he
is
a
good
marksman
we
made
up
our
minds
that
we
were
to
have
quails
for
supper
there
he
is
now
added
egan
as
an
impatient
yelp
sounded
at
the
door
i
am
afraid
you
are
mistaken
replied
don
and
the
sequel
proved
that
he
was
for
just
then
the
door
was
thrown
open
and
don
s
hounds
which
cuff
in
obedience
to
bert
s
orders
had
brought
up
to
guard
the
came
bounding
in
there
were
six
of
them
and
the
one
which
held
the
foremost
place
in
don
s
estimation
was
carlo
the
dog
that
had
been
the
first
to
respond
to
his
whistle
when
he
was
tied
up
in
godfrey
evans
s
he
was
an
immense
brute
as
well
as
a
savage
one
and
when
he
raised
himself
on
his
hind
feet
and
placed
his
paws
on
don
s
shoulders
his
head
was
higher
than
his
master
s
we
will
keep
them
in
here
with
us
until
hop
comes
for
as
they
are
not
very
well
acquainted
with
him
they
might
object
to
his
coming
to
the
house
said
bert
now
cuff
dish
up
a
couple
of
those
ducks
in
your
very
best
style
be
in
a
hurry
for
we
are
curtis
and
egan
having
exchanged
their
boots
for
shoes
and
their
heavy
for
others
of
lighter
material
set
to
work
to
clean
their
guns
while
the
rest
of
the
boys
drew
their
chairs
up
in
front
of
the
fire
and
asked
one
another
what
it
was
that
was
detaining
hopkins
he
couldn
t
get
lost
they
were
sure
of
that
for
all
he
had
to
do
when
he
wanted
to
come
home
was
to
follow
the
shore
of
the
lake
and
he
would
find
the
without
the
least
trouble
do
you
suppose
he
would
be
in
any
danger
from
those
vagabond
friends
of
ours
if
he
should
chance
to
stumble
upon
them
in
the
woods
said
curtis
as
he
pointed
his
toward
the
lamp
and
looked
through
the
barrel
to
make
sure
that
it
was
perfectly
clean
i
must
confess
that
i
didn
t
quite
like
the
looks
of
i
never
thought
of
them
said
don
jumping
up
and
taking
his
down
from
the
antlers
on
which
it
rested
i
believe
he
would
be
in
danger
if
he
should
meet
one
of
those
fellows
in
the
woods
for
he
wears
a
splendid
gold
watch
and
chain
and
i
noticed
that
the
man
who
was
chopping
wood
when
we
came
here
this
morning
looked
at
the
chain
very
frequently
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
plan
to
signal
to
better
let
me
do
it
said
egan
he
can
hear
my
gun
farther
than
he
can
accompanied
by
all
the
boys
egan
went
out
on
the
shore
of
the
lake
and
fired
both
barrels
of
his
heavy
piece
in
quick
succession
but
there
was
no
response
again
and
again
the
roared
awaking
a
thousand
echoes
along
the
shore
but
still
the
missing
boy
did
not
reply
when
egan
had
fired
away
all
the
cartridges
he
had
brought
out
with
him
the
boys
went
back
into
the
cabin
and
sat
down
and
looked
at
one
another
they
began
to
fear
that
their
friend
s
had
followed
him
from
bridgeport
to
rochdale
and
that
he
had
got
himself
into
some
kind
of
a
scrape
chapter
xv
lester
brigham
makes
new
friends
we
said
in
the
second
chapter
that
after
bob
owens
ran
away
from
home
to
become
a
hunter
and
godfrey
evans
and
his
son
dan
went
to
work
to
earn
an
honest
living
and
david
evans
became
and
lester
brigham
withdrew
himself
from
the
society
of
the
boys
in
the
neighborhood
the
inhabitants
of
rochdale
and
the
surrounding
country
settled
back
into
their
old
ways
and
waited
for
something
to
happen
that
would
create
an
excitement
unfortunately
they
were
not
obliged
to
wait
long
after
one
has
spent
years
of
his
life
in
idleness
he
finds
it
an
exceedingly
difficult
task
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
and
make
a
radical
and
permanent
change
in
his
whole
course
of
conduct
and
godfrey
and
dan
were
no
exceptions
to
this
rule
so
long
as
they
worked
for
general
gordon
who
took
pains
to
keep
a
close
watch
over
them
and
to
encourage
them
by
every
means
in
his
power
there
was
no
fault
to
be
found
with
them
they
labored
early
and
late
godfrey
as
we
know
saving
enough
from
his
hard
earnings
to
refund
the
money
of
which
he
had
robbed
clarence
gordon
on
the
highway
the
old
cabin
in
which
they
lived
was
repaired
and
refurnished
and
everything
seemed
to
be
well
with
them
but
when
they
had
cut
all
the
wood
the
general
could
use
that
year
and
the
latter
went
away
on
business
leaving
them
to
take
care
of
themselves
the
trouble
began
they
made
a
few
feeble
attempts
to
find
more
work
and
in
their
efforts
to
do
so
they
came
in
contact
with
the
professional
loafers
about
the
landing
whose
influence
over
them
was
anything
but
beneficial
the
majority
of
them
spent
their
time
in
watching
the
steamboats
taking
part
in
and
making
a
pretense
of
hunting
and
trapping
for
a
livelihood
while
those
who
had
work
and
were
able
to
pay
for
having
it
done
did
not
want
godfrey
and
dan
to
do
it
owens
bob
s
father
was
mainly
responsible
for
this
state
of
affairs
he
had
not
yet
got
over
being
angry
at
general
gordon
for
putting
in
a
bid
for
the
when
he
wanted
it
himself
and
he
never
allowed
an
opportunity
to
abuse
him
to
pass
unimproved
gordon
seems
to
have
taken
godfrey
and
his
family
under
his
protecting
wing
and
now
he
can
provide
for
them
and
welcome
owens
often
said
i
want
some
wood
cut
the
worst
way
but
i
ll
see
godfrey
and
dan
in
jerusalem
before
they
shall
have
the
job
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
gordon
i
might
have
had
my
boy
at
home
with
me
yes
and
my
boy
would
not
have
been
obliged
to
make
a
hermit
of
himself
brigham
would
always
remark
when
he
heard
owens
talking
in
this
way
these
two
men
had
been
rather
distant
toward
each
other
after
brigham
s
refusal
to
go
on
bob
s
bond
but
they
were
firm
friends
now
they
both
hated
general
gordon
and
for
nearly
the
same
reason
brigham
had
come
to
rochdale
with
the
idea
that
his
money
would
at
once
make
him
the
head
man
of
the
county
but
in
this
he
was
most
sadly
disappointed
he
found
that
the
general
was
worth
just
as
much
if
not
more
than
he
was
that
he
was
everybody
s
friend
and
adviser
a
member
of
the
legislature
and
a
candidate
for
governor
and
that
it
would
be
of
no
use
for
anybody
to
try
to
usurp
his
place
that
was
the
reason
he
didn
t
want
the
general
to
have
the
contract
for
carrying
the
mail
and
when
he
learned
that
the
latter
had
influence
enough
to
secure
it
without
any
of
his
help
he
was
greatly
enraged
and
felt
quite
as
bitter
toward
his
rich
neighbor
as
bob
s
father
did
never
mind
said
owens
it
is
a
long
lane
that
has
no
turning
and
we
shall
some
day
be
able
to
get
square
with
gordon
for
that
piece
of
business
mark
my
words
david
evans
will
sooner
or
later
prove
himself
to
be
utterly
unworthy
the
confidence
that
is
placed
in
him
it
can
t
be
otherwise
for
he
owens
was
about
to
add
that
david
was
the
son
of
a
thief
as
well
as
the
brother
of
one
but
he
didn
t
say
it
for
he
recollected
in
time
that
his
own
son
was
not
above
he
had
left
rochdale
having
in
his
possession
more
than
a
hundred
and
sixty
dollars
that
did
not
belong
to
him
where
have
you
fellows
kept
yourselves
so
long
asked
one
of
the
loafers
when
godfrey
and
dan
once
more
made
their
appearance
at
the
landing
carrying
their
rifles
on
their
shoulders
as
in
the
days
gone
by
been
spendin
some
of
dave
s
money
in
a
tower
to
europe
o
been
cuttin
wood
for
gordon
eh
well
that
s
what
i
call
nigger
s
work
and
wouldn
t
do
it
for
no
ristocrat
it
s
right
smart
easier
to
hunt
and
trap
there
s
going
to
be
a
power
of
deer
and
turkey
this
fall
and
silas
jones
has
agreed
to
pay
cash
for
all
i
can
bring
him
he
d
be
willing
to
make
the
same
bargain
with
you
i
know
for
he
wants
all
he
can
get
to
ship
to
some
commission
merchant
in
louis
he
gives
eight
cents
a
pound
for
the
deer
and
sixty
cents
apiece
for
the
i
ll
just
tell
ye
what
s
the
gospel
truth
dannie
said
godfrey
after
some
of
his
old
friends
had
talked
to
him
in
this
way
a
few
times
i
ve
got
just
as
much
right
to
hire
somebody
to
chop
my
wood
as
gordon
has
an
i
ain
t
goin
to
cut
no
more
fur
him
nor
no
other
ristocrat
i
m
goin
huntin
so
be
i
said
dan
who
was
delighted
at
the
prospect
of
going
back
to
his
old
way
of
living
so
ye
shall
dannie
we
ve
done
niggers
work
long
enough
an
now
we
ll
be
gentlemen
agin
like
we
used
to
be
thar
ain
t
no
call
fur
you
an
me
to
work
so
hard
every
day
when
everybody
else
takes
it
so
easy
down
thar
at
the
landin
an
we
won
t
do
it
neither
here
s
dave
makin
a
power
of
money
and
as
he
ain
t
of
age
yet
every
cent
he
arns
ought
to
go
into
my
own
pocket
it
shall
go
thar
too
or
i
ll
make
a
bigger
furse
here
in
the
settlement
nor
i
did
afore
gordon
needn
t
go
to
pokin
his
nose
into
the
matter
either
for
he
won
t
scare
me
as
easy
as
he
did
the
last
how
much
would
a
deer
be
worth
at
eight
cents
a
pound
pap
inquired
dan
wal
that
depends
if
he
weighed
a
hundred
an
twenty
pounds
he
d
bring
as
much
as
five
or
six
dollars
i
reckon
an
if
he
weighed
two
hundred
an
fifty
pounds
like
the
one
i
killed
three
winters
ago
he
d
be
worth
fifteen
an
mebbe
dollars
answered
godfrey
who
was
no
quicker
at
figures
than
he
used
to
be
that
s
a
heap
more
nor
i
could
make
chopping
wood
said
dan
course
it
is
a
smart
hunter
like
yourself
oughter
be
able
to
get
a
deer
every
day
to
say
nothin
of
the
turkeys
ye
might
trap
an
shoot
sides
ye
d
be
doin
a
gentleman
s
work
an
not
a
nigger
this
conversation
took
place
between
dan
and
his
father
one
bright
summer
s
day
when
they
were
returning
home
from
the
landing
whither
they
had
gone
under
pretense
of
looking
for
work
evans
knew
there
was
something
wrong
the
moment
they
appeared
at
the
door
and
she
was
not
long
in
finding
out
what
it
was
godfrey
and
dan
had
worked
faithfully
during
the
whole
of
the
winter
and
spring
and
evans
although
she
did
not
see
a
cent
of
the
money
they
earned
david
being
expected
to
look
out
for
her
comfort
began
to
believe
that
their
reformation
was
complete
and
that
it
would
prove
to
be
lasting
but
now
she
learned
to
her
great
sorrow
that
she
had
been
too
hasty
in
coming
to
these
conclusions
when
she
saw
that
the
axes
were
thrown
aside
and
that
the
rifles
which
had
so
long
been
idle
were
daily
taken
down
from
their
hooks
she
knew
that
bad
times
were
coming
again
and
they
came
apace
too
godfrey
and
dan
seemed
to
have
lost
all
their
skill
as
hunters
for
the
game
they
brought
to
the
landing
did
not
amount
to
much
it
is
true
that
they
made
some
money
but
it
all
slipped
through
their
fingers
without
doing
them
any
good
and
by
the
time
cold
weather
came
they
were
as
ragged
and
lazy
as
they
had
ever
been
and
just
as
ready
to
engage
in
any
scheme
that
would
bring
them
money
without
work
meanwhile
lester
brigham
mustered
up
courage
enough
to
come
out
of
his
retirement
and
was
somewhat
surprised
as
well
as
vexed
to
learn
that
he
might
have
done
so
long
ago
if
he
had
felt
so
disposed
and
that
his
voluntary
banishment
was
entirely
needless
nobody
paid
much
attention
to
him
fred
and
joe
packard
and
all
the
other
decent
boys
who
lived
in
the
neighborhood
greeted
him
pleasantly
whenever
they
passed
him
on
the
road
and
no
one
except
the
loafers
at
the
landing
had
anything
to
say
to
him
concerning
his
past
conduct
these
gentlemen
of
leisure
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
question
him
regarding
that
terrible
on
bruin
s
island
in
which
he
and
the
absent
bob
had
won
so
much
renown
and
now
and
then
they
reminded
him
that
he
had
assisted
in
burning
don
gordon
s
but
they
did
it
all
so
that
lester
could
not
get
angry
at
them
don
s
got
another
shantee
over
there
on
the
point
and
i
shouldn
t
be
sorry
to
see
that
go
up
in
smoke
like
the
old
one
did
a
man
of
the
godfrey
evans
stamp
said
to
lester
one
day
tain
t
no
use
to
him
and
bert
and
by
building
it
there
they
have
taken
the
bread
out
of
the
mouths
of
a
good
many
folks
who
live
about
here
as
soon
as
school
is
out
they
ll
come
home
get
a
party
of
their
friends
together
and
kick
up
such
a
rumpus
there
on
the
lake
that
all
the
birds
will
be
driven
out
of
the
country
and
when
a
poor
man
gets
out
of
bacon
he
can
t
have
a
duck
or
goose
for
dinner
for
there
won
t
be
any
for
him
to
every
time
lester
brigham
rode
away
from
the
very
soon
fell
into
the
habit
of
going
there
as
regularly
as
godfrey
and
dan
carried
with
him
the
impression
that
the
gordons
were
not
held
in
very
high
esteem
and
that
he
and
bob
owens
had
the
sympathy
of
all
the
best
people
in
the
settlement
encouraged
by
this
belief
he
began
making
efforts
to
work
his
way
into
the
good
graces
of
the
packard
boys
but
he
failed
utterly
fred
and
joe
were
warm
friends
of
the
gordons
and
they
met
his
advances
in
so
freezing
a
manner
that
lester
was
highly
enraged
and
straightway
set
his
wits
at
work
to
conjure
up
some
plan
for
getting
even
with
them
he
wished
for
bob
owens
more
than
he
had
ever
wished
for
him
before
if
bob
had
been
there
he
would
not
have
joined
him
in
any
plan
for
mischief
or
revenge
for
he
was
not
that
kind
of
a
boy
now
but
as
the
only
friend
he
had
ever
had
since
he
had
been
in
the
settlement
was
many
miles
away
and
lester
could
no
longer
bear
to
live
alone
he
was
forced
to
look
for
another
who
had
plenty
of
time
at
his
disposal
and
who
would
accompany
him
on
all
his
hunting
and
fishing
excursions
he
found
him
at
last
in
the
person
of
dan
evans
who
lost
no
time
in
turning
their
intimacy
to
account
lester
as
we
know
was
provided
with
all
the
implements
that
any
sportsman
could
possibly
find
use
for
but
he
was
a
very
poor
shot
and
he
knew
nothing
whatever
about
hunting
he
had
however
a
larger
amount
of
pocket
money
than
he
could
spend
in
rochdale
and
whenever
dan
evans
made
a
good
bag
lester
would
select
from
it
such
birds
or
animals
as
he
fancied
pay
the
cash
for
them
and
carry
them
home
to
show
as
trophies
of
his
own
skill
of
course
dan
was
not
just
such
a
companion
as
he
would
like
to
have
had
but
he
was
better
than
no
friend
at
all
and
in
his
presence
lester
could
brag
to
his
heart
s
content
no
matter
how
unreasonable
the
story
he
told
dan
never
disputed
it
or
even
looked
incredulous
he
was
much
too
cunning
for
that
if
i
had
the
money
that
your
brother
brought
my
father
last
night
i
wouldn
t
be
here
at
this
time
lester
said
to
dan
one
day
he
had
of
late
grown
very
tired
of
life
in
mississippi
and
was
almost
constantly
urging
his
father
to
let
him
go
somewhere
he
didn
t
much
care
where
so
long
as
he
could
find
ample
opportunity
for
recreation
and
would
not
be
required
to
work
or
study
brigham
had
threatened
to
send
him
away
to
school
if
he
did
not
leave
off
bothering
him
and
lester
was
so
very
much
afraid
he
would
carry
his
threat
into
execution
that
he
began
to
think
seriously
of
leaving
home
as
his
friend
bob
owens
had
done
the
only
thing
that
stood
in
his
way
was
the
want
of
money
when
the
mail
was
distributed
last
night
my
father
got
a
letter
with
five
thousand
dollars
in
it
continued
lester
he
gets
that
much
on
the
fifteenth
day
of
every
month
from
his
agent
who
is
selling
off
our
property
in
the
dan
opened
his
eyes
in
great
surprise
five
thousand
dollars
was
not
so
large
an
amount
as
he
and
his
father
had
hoped
to
make
by
digging
up
the
barrel
of
gold
and
silver
that
was
supposed
to
be
buried
in
general
gordon
s
but
still
it
was
a
lot
of
much
greater
sum
than
dan
ever
expected
to
earn
by
honest
labor
i
don
t
want
you
to
say
anything
about
it
continued
lester
for
it
is
my
opinion
that
there
are
a
good
many
men
about
here
who
would
not
be
any
too
good
to
waylay
dave
and
rob
him
if
they
knew
that
he
was
entrusted
with
the
care
of
so
much
dan
protested
that
he
wouldn
t
think
of
such
a
thing
but
still
the
information
he
had
received
seemed
to
make
an
impression
upon
him
for
he
became
very
silent
and
thoughtful
after
that
and
lester
could
hardly
get
a
word
out
of
him
he
seemed
to
have
suddenly
lost
all
interest
in
hunting
for
he
missed
several
fair
shots
and
finally
declaring
that
he
did
not
feel
in
the
humor
for
sport
he
abruptly
abandoned
his
companion
leaving
him
to
continue
the
hunt
alone
or
to
go
home
just
as
he
pleased
an
idea
had
suggested
itself
to
dan
and
he
wanted
to
get
off
by
himself
so
that
he
could
turn
it
over
in
his
mind
and
see
what
he
could
make
of
it
five
thousand
dollars
said
dan
to
himself
as
he
hurried
through
the
woods
that
s
a
right
smart
chance
of
money
the
first
thing
you
know
and
to
think
that
our
leetle
dave
should
have
the
handlin
of
it
dave
makes
stacks
of
greenbacks
by
ridin
around
the
country
doin
nothin
he
wears
good
clothes
all
the
time
and
here
s
my
buttons
i
ve
got
just
as
good
a
right
to
have
five
thousand
dollars
as
brigham
has
i
wish
i
was
i
wouldn
t
ask
to
go
more
n
one
trip
an
after
that
nobody
in
this
country
wouldn
t
ever
set
eyes
onto
me
dan
seemed
to
know
where
he
was
going
and
what
he
intended
to
do
when
he
got
there
for
he
kept
straight
ahead
without
once
slackening
his
pace
paying
no
heed
to
the
squirrels
which
barked
at
him
as
he
hurried
along
and
making
his
way
around
the
foot
of
diamond
lake
he
finally
reached
the
levee
that
ran
along
the
bank
of
the
river
here
he
found
a
dilapidated
which
had
been
tied
up
to
the
bank
for
a
month
or
enough
at
any
rate
for
dan
to
become
very
well
acquainted
with
the
men
who
owned
it
he
had
met
them
while
hunting
in
the
woods
had
showed
them
the
best
places
to
set
their
traps
for
minks
and
coons
had
taken
part
with
them
in
at
the
landing
and
had
given
them
information
which
rendered
it
comparatively
easy
for
them
to
forage
upon
the
and
of
the
planters
who
lived
in
the
neighborhood
they
had
drawn
a
good
many
secrets
from
the
especially
that
they
intended
to
use
for
their
own
benefit
as
soon
as
the
opportunity
was
presented
dan
walked
up
the
plank
that
ran
from
the
shore
to
the
bow
of
the
and
entered
the
cabin
without
ceremony
it
was
as
dismal
a
hole
as
he
had
ever
looked
into
and
dan
accustomed
as
he
was
to
gloomy
surroundings
wondered
how
anybody
could
live
there
it
contained
but
one
apartment
and
that
was
used
as
a
kitchen
and
the
men
were
lounging
in
their
bunks
while
their
wives
were
gathered
about
the
rusty
stove
puffing
vigorously
at
their
when
the
boat
careened
under
dan
s
weight
one
of
the
men
sprang
from
his
bunk
and
made
an
effort
to
conceal
a
couple
of
chickens
he
had
just
been
picking
but
as
soon
as
he
saw
who
the
visitor
was
he
laid
them
down
again
for
he
knew
he
had
nothing
to
fear
mornin
i
reckon
i
skeered
ye
jest
a
trifle
didn
t
i
how
wet

here
said
dan
glancing
at
the
little
pools
of
water
that
filled
every
depression
in
the
rough
uneven
floor
come
in
an
take
a
cheer
dannie
said
the
man
who
had
tried
to
hide
the
chickens
while
the
other
two
sat
up
in
their
bunks
and
nodded
to
him
it
is
damp
that
s
a
fact
but

yesterday

an
i
wouldn

stand
back
if
i
wanted
to
go
thar
thar
aint
no
sense
in
don
s
livin
in
that
shantee
when
his
father
s
got
a
big
house
with
carpets
an
a
pianner
into
it
an
chiny
an
silver
to
set
the
table
no
thar
ain
t
said
the
man
who
had
done
the
most
of
the
talking
and
who
answered
to
the
name
of
barlow
we
ll
move
our
duds
over
thar
if

can
get
in
an
stay
thar
until
we
can
fix
our
boat
up
a
little
if
everything
works
right
we
ll
have
a
better
one
before
he
got
upon
his
feet
as
he
spoke
and
drew
from
under
his
bunk
a
short
bar
of
iron
which
had
more
than
once
come
into
play
when
barlow
wanted
to
force
an
entrance
into
somebody
s
carrying
this
in
his
hand
he
went
ashore
with
dan
who
led
the
way
through
the
woods
toward
don
gordon
s
it
was
the
work
of
scarcely
a
moment
to
pull
out
one
of
the
staples
and
when
that
had
been
done
the
door
swung
open
and
dan
and
his
companion
went
in
to
take
a
survey
of
the
interior
it
was
dry
and
comfortable
as
clean
as
it
could
possibly
be
and
barlow
at
once
decided
that
he
would
live
there
as
long
as
he
remained
in
that
neighborhood
it
s
nice
to
be
rich
said
he
seating
himself
in
one
of
the
empty
bunks
after
touching
a
match
to
the
pile
of
light
wood
which
the
lawful
owner
of
the
had
left
in
the
it
s
nice
to
have
horses
an
hounds
an
niggers
to
work
for
you
while
you
have
nothing
to
do
but
ride
around
the
country
an
enjoy
yourself
that
s
the
way
i
d
live
if
i
had
the
chance
to
make
money
that
your
brother
s
yes
dave
makes
right
smart
said
dan
with
some
pride
in
his
tones
an
he
don
t
do
no
work
nuther
but
he
s
scandalous
mean
with
what
he
arns
he
gives
it
all
to
mam
an
me
an
pap
never
have
none
of
it
he
s
gettin
mighty
tired
of
dave
s
way
of
doin
pap
is
an
t
other
night
he
told
dave
that
he
could
jest
fork
over
every
cent
of
his
arnin
s
an
let
pap
have
the
handlin
of
em
dave
he
said
he
wouldn
t
do
it
an
i
m
looking
for
the
biggest
kind
of
a
furse
up
to
our
house
when
next
your
pap
has
got
the
right
to
every
cent
dave
makes
till
he
is
years
old
an
dave
can
t
hender
him
from
takin
it
said
barlow
i
spose
he
carries
a
heap
of
money
between
the
landin
an
the
in
that
of
his
i
should
say
he
did
exclaimed
dan
only
last
night
he
brought
in
five
thousand
dollars
for
father
of
that
boy
who
was
down
here
with
me
t
other
day
lester
said
so
this
mornin
he
told
me
too
that
dave
brings
in
just
that
much
on
the
fifteenth
day
of
every
barlow
started
and
looked
hard
at
dan
and
then
he
looked
down
at
the
floor
wal
if
i
was
dave
said
he
after
a
moment
s
pause
i
d
bring
in
jest
one
more
of
them
letters
an
then
i
d
so
would
i
said
dan
what
does
brigham
want
with
that
money
he
s
got
more
n
he
can
use
already
lester
said
that
s
always
the
way
with
rich
folks
dannie
the
more
they
get
the
more
they
want
an
me
an
you
an
everybody
like
us
could
starve
for
all
they
care
we
re
jest
as
good
as
they
be
too
it
s
a
wonder
to
me
that
somebody
don
t
go
for
dave
an
take
some
of
them
letters
away
from
i
don
t
care
if
they
do
answered
dan
if
i
should
see
em
doin
it
i
wouldn
t
lift
a
hand
to
hender
em
that
would
bring
dave
down
from
his
high
hoss
fur
gen
ral
gordon
wouldn
t
never
hire
him
to
tote
the
mail
agin
an
then
he
d
have
to
scratch
for
a
livin
the
way
me
an
pap
it
would
serve
him
right
for
bein
so
stingy
said
barlow
but
the
feller
that
goes
for
him
had
better
watch
out
continued
dan
fur
dave
he
carries
a
dissolver
in
his
pocket
it
shoots
six
times
an
he
knows
how
to
use
i
don
t
reckon
that
would
stand
in
the
way
of
anybody
who
wanted
them
letters
said
barlow
with
a
laugh
if
dave
should
see
a
couple
of
loaded
rifles
lookin
him
square
in
the
face
he
wouldn
t
think
of
his
mebbe
he
wouldn
t
said
dan
but
if
could
ride
that
the
next
time
brigham
s
comes
dave
could
be
tuk
sick
or
get
lost
in
the
woods
or
something
so
t
i
could
take
his
fellow
that
wanted
them
five
thousand
wouldn
t
have
no
trouble
for
i
shouldn
t
have
no
dissolver
with
me
but
he
d
have
to
give
me
this
was
the
idea
that
had
so
suddenly
suggested
itself
to
dan
get
david
out
of
the
way
for
one
day
so
that
he
could
carry
the
mail
and
give
barlow
and
his
two
friends
a
chance
to
secure
a
portion
of
brigham
s
money
if
barlow
had
jumped
at
the
bait
thus
adroitly
thrown
out
dan
would
have
proposed
that
after
the
robbery
had
been
accomplished
they
should
all
take
to
the
push
it
out
into
the
river
and
let
the
current
take
it
to
new
orleans
where
they
would
divide
the
money
and
separate
dan
going
his
way
and
barlow
and
his
companions
going
theirs
dan
thought
it
was
a
splendid
idea
but
barlow
knocked
it
into
a
cocked
hat
by
the
very
next
words
he
uttered
you
couldn
t
take
your
brother
s
place
even
for
a
single
day
said
he
what
fur
demanded
dan
who
was
greatly
surprised
can
t
i
ride
that
thar
colt
of
his
n
as
well
as
he
kin
i
spose
you
can
but
that
ain
t
the
pint
you
ve
never
been
swore
in
fur
a
an
so
you
would
have
no
right
to
tech
that
if
dave
should
be
tuk
sick
or
get
lost
in
the
woods
gen
ral
gordon
would
have
to
carry
the
mail
whoop
yelled
dan
jumping
up
and
knocking
his
heels
together
he
d
be
a
wusser
man
to
fool
with
nor
dave
fur
he
s
an
old
barlow
made
no
reply
the
boy
had
given
him
something
to
think
about
and
he
was
as
anxious
to
be
rid
of
his
presence
as
dan
was
to
get
rid
of
his
friend
lester
brigham
he
left
him
without
taking
the
trouble
to
assign
any
reason
for
his
hurried
departure
and
went
back
to
his
boat
in
the
course
of
the
day
he
and
his
friends
transferred
their
luggage
to
the
and
there
they
lived
until
they
were
ordered
out
by
its
indignant
owner
as
their
time
was
not
fully
occupied
they
had
leisure
to
talk
about
the
and
brigham
s
money
and
we
shall
presently
see
how
their
numerous
consultations
resulted
chapter
xvi
the
in
trouble
here
dandy
here
punch
to
heel
said
bert
as
he
and
his
four
companions
started
down
the
shore
of
the
lake
in
search
of
their
supper
why
do
you
make
the
dogs
go
behind
demanded
hopkins
why
don
t
you
hie
them
on
and
perhaps
they
will
stand
something
for
us
i
should
think
this
ought
to
be
good
quail
so
it
is
answered
bert
and
if
you
want
a
chance
at
some
we
no
we
won
t
interrupted
egan
if
little
birds
are
the
height
of
hop
s
ambition
let
him
take
the
pointers
some
day
and
go
off
by
himself
we
are
after
ducks
now
and
we
want
the
dogs
to
stay
with
us
and
bring
our
game
ashore
when
we
kill
hopkins
made
no
reply
like
all
enthusiastic
sportsmen
he
had
his
own
ideas
of
shooting
and
he
was
much
more
successful
with
some
kinds
of
game
than
he
was
with
others
there
was
no
boy
who
could
beat
him
in
getting
over
a
rough
country
on
horseback
when
the
hounds
were
in
pursuit
of
a
deer
or
fox
he
was
almost
certain
to
kill
every
snipe
quail
or
grouse
that
got
up
before
him
but
a
wild
duck
going
down
wind
with
the
speed
of
a
lightning
express
train
bothered
him
with
all
his
practice
he
had
never
been
able
to
make
a
respectable
bag
of
so
he
stood
around
holding
his
gun
in
the
hollow
of
his
arm
and
watched
egan
who
cut
down
every
duck
that
passed
anywhere
within
yards
of
him
the
pointers
brought
them
out
as
fast
as
they
fell
into
the
lake
and
it
was
not
long
before
bert
and
fred
packard
who
were
polite
enough
to
allow
their
guests
to
do
all
the
shooting
had
about
as
many
ducks
slung
over
their
shoulders
as
they
wanted
to
carry
this
is
like
the
handle
of
a
on
one
side
said
hopkins
at
length
i
must
find
something
to
shoot
at
for
i
can
t
carry
these
loads
back
home
with
he
gradually
drew
away
from
his
companions
as
he
spoke
but
he
had
no
intention
of
going
off
alone
he
kept
his
eyes
on
the
dogs
and
when
he
saw
them
looking
at
him
he
waved
his
hand
toward
the
bushes
the
intelligent
and
animals
understood
him
and
believing
no
doubt
that
hunting
upland
birds
was
easier
and
pleasanter
work
than
retrieving
ducks
from
the
cold
waters
of
the
lake
they
were
prompt
to
obey
the
order
thus
silently
conveyed
to
them
egan
and
the
rest
did
not
see
the
dogs
when
they
went
away
for
their
attention
was
fully
occupied
with
a
fine
flock
of
mallards
some
of
which
were
coming
across
the
lake
holding
a
course
which
promised
to
bring
them
within
easy
range
of
egan
s
the
latter
who
was
snugly
hidden
in
a
thicket
of
bushes
had
cocked
both
barrels
of
his
gun
and
was
waiting
for
the
ducks
to
come
a
little
nearer
to
his
place
of
concealment
when
all
on
a
sudden
they
took
wing
and
disappeared
up
the
lake
egan
and
his
companions
looked
all
around
to
see
what
had
frightened
them
and
discovered
hopkins
and
the
pointers
in
the
act
of
crossing
a
fence
that
ran
between
the
woods
and
a
now
hop
that
will
never
do
cried
egan
how
are
we
going
to
get
our
ducks
ashore
if
you
take
the
dogs
away
throw
chunks
on
the
other
side
of
them
and
let
the
waves
wash
them
ashore
was
the
reply
i
saw
a
flock
of
quails
over
here
and
as
soon
as
i
get
some
of
them
i
will
bring
the
dogs
you
re
not
much
of
a
sportsman
hop
said
curtis
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
flock
of
quails
covey
is
the
proper
aw
said
hopkins
well
i
don
t
care
what
you
call
them
so
long
as
you
will
let
me
have
the
dogs
long
enough
to
shoot
some
of
them
i
ll
be
back
in
a
few
the
duck
hunters
were
obliged
to
be
satisfied
with
this
promise
and
when
hopkins
made
it
he
fully
intended
to
keep
it
but
in
the
ardor
of
the
chase
he
forgot
all
about
it
the
pointers
very
soon
found
the
covey
which
hopkins
had
marked
down
very
accurately
and
when
it
took
wing
at
his
approach
he
brought
down
five
members
of
it
very
handsomely
punch
and
dandy
dropped
to
is
when
the
gun
was
fired
they
laid
down
and
waited
for
the
hunter
to
when
they
were
ordered
to
seek
dead
they
executed
a
manœuvre
which
some
of
our
best
artists
who
love
a
dog
and
gun
have
often
reproduced
on
canvas
the
reason
why
dogs
are
taught
to
drop
to
shot
is
this
the
members
of
the
covey
do
not
all
fly
away
at
the
same
time
but
some
generally
remain
behind
preferring
to
trust
to
concealment
rather
than
to
flight
if
the
dogs
were
permitted
to
rush
in
at
once
to
secure
the
dead
birds
they
would
flush
these
laggards
which
would
get
off
scot
free
for
of
course
the
sportsman
could
not
shoot
at
them
while
he
held
an
empty
gun
in
his
hands
seek
dead
commanded
hopkins
as
soon
as
he
had
reloaded
his
gun
whereupon
the
dogs
jumped
up
and
after
running
about
among
the
bushes
for
a
few
minutes
stopped
and
came
to
a
point
fetch
said
the
hunter
and
in
obedience
to
the
order
each
dog
seized
a
bird
they
were
coming
in
with
them
when
dandy
stopped
as
if
he
had
suddenly
been
deprived
of
all
power
of
action
and
came
to
another
point
he
was
standing
a
live
bird
while
he
held
a
dead
one
in
his
mouth
punch
backed
him
is
he
stopped
and
pointed
also
although
he
did
not
see
or
smell
the
the
two
presented
a
picture
that
hopkins
had
he
been
handy
with
the
brush
or
pencil
would
have
been
glad
to
preserve
he
stood
and
looked
at
it
for
at
least
five
minutes
the
dogs
holding
their
point
stanchly
all
the
while
and
then
he
flushed
the
bird
and
brought
it
down
well
done
boys
said
hopkins
after
he
had
reloaded
his
gun
and
placed
the
two
quails
carefully
away
in
the
capacious
pockets
of
his
you
have
been
educated
by
somebody
who
understands
his
business
seek
hopkins
had
kept
his
eyes
on
the
surviving
members
of
the
covey
and
marked
them
down
by
that
we
mean
that
he
had
noted
the
exact
spot
on
which
they
alighted
but
he
did
not
intend
to
pay
any
further
attention
to
them
just
then
he
knew
that
every
minute
he
spent
in
hunting
them
up
would
be
just
so
much
time
wasted
he
had
learned
by
experience
that
after
a
covey
has
once
been
flushed
it
is
almost
impossible
for
the
best
dogs
to
find
it
again
a
large
number
of
quails
have
been
seen
to
settle
down
in
a
clump
of
bushes
not
more
than
ten
feet
in
circumference
and
the
dogs
have
run
through
their
place
of
concealment
in
every
direction
without
seeing
or
scenting
a
single
bird
every
sportsman
has
noticed
this
and
some
of
the
best
of
them
affirm
that
the
birds
are
endowed
with
the
power
of
retaining
their
scent
but
whether
that
is
so
or
nobody
has
ever
been
able
to
refute
fact
that
they
are
hard
to
find
when
once
they
have
become
scattered
remains
the
same
i
will
attend
to
you
in
half
an
hour
soliloquized
hopkins
when
all
the
dead
birds
had
been
brought
in
by
that
time
you
will
begin
to
run
around
and
the
dogs
will
be
able
to
scent
you
hie
on
boys
hunt
up
another
hopkins
had
never
seen
so
many
quails
as
he
saw
that
afternoon
not
even
in
maryland
where
they
are
found
in
such
numbers
that
they
attract
sportsmen
from
distant
states
he
found
so
many
fresh
coveys
that
he
forgot
all
about
the
one
he
had
left
in
the
the
pointers
led
him
on
and
on
and
hopkins
never
stopped
to
take
his
bearings
until
he
had
filled
the
pockets
of
his
so
full
of
birds
that
they
would
not
hold
another
one
then
he
sat
down
on
a
log
to
rest
and
to
listen
for
the
roar
of
egan
s
gun
but
he
did
not
hear
it
for
egan
and
his
party
were
on
their
way
to
the
having
secured
all
the
birds
they
wanted
i
declare
it
is
growing
dark
said
hopkins
and
if
i
don
t
reach
the
cabin
pretty
soon
i
shall
have
to
stay
in
the
woods
all
night
that
would
not
be
pleasant
for
the
fellows
never
would
leave
off
poking
fun
at
me
come
on
boys
i
think
the
lake
lies
in
this
but
hopkins
was
not
the
only
hunter
who
has
been
completely
turned
around
in
the
woods
and
instead
of
going
toward
the
lake
he
followed
a
course
that
lay
parallel
with
the
shore
and
about
a
mile
and
a
half
from
it
he
walked
rapidly
passing
through
godfrey
evans
s
old
cotton
grown
up
to
within
less
than
two
hundred
yards
of
his
cabin
and
finally
found
himself
sitting
on
the
top
rail
of
a
fence
which
ran
along
by
the
side
of
a
smooth
road
he
did
not
remember
that
he
had
ever
seen
that
road
before
he
believed
that
it
ran
from
the
river
back
into
the
country
but
which
was
the
of
it
and
which
the
he
could
not
tell
the
pointers
did
not
seem
disposed
to
help
him
out
of
his
quandary
for
when
he
stopped
on
the
top
rail
of
the
fence
to
rest
they
laid
themselves
contentedly
down
by
the
side
of
the
road
to
wait
until
he
was
ready
to
go
on
i
am
out
of
my
reckoning
as
sure
as
the
world
said
hopkins
to
himself
and
there
s
no
house
in
sight
ah
here
comes
somebody
i
ll
ask
him
if
he
will
tell
me
which
way
i
must
go
to
find
the
is
if
i
can
stop
just
then
hopkins
heard
the
clatter
of
a
horse
s
hoofs
on
the
hard
road
he
knew
that
the
animal
was
approaching
at
the
top
of
his
speed
but
he
could
not
see
him
for
the
thick
bushes
shut
out
his
view
he
jumped
off
the
fence
and
hurried
to
the
road
to
intercept
the
horseman
and
just
then
a
riderless
nag
dashed
by
running
with
the
speed
of
the
wind
hopkins
knew
him
the
moment
he
caught
sight
of
him
for
he
had
seen
him
before
there
sir
he
exclaimed
i
knew
that
colt
would
do
some
damage
if
he
ever
got
the
chance
when
you
see
a
horse
with
a
narrow
forehead
and
peaked
ears
that
almost
touch
at
the
tips
you
want
to
look
out
for
him
he
s
gone
and
tumbled
dave
evans
and
his
mail
bag
off
into
the
ditch
and
who
knows
but
he
may
have
broken
his
neck
as
this
thought
passed
through
the
boy
s
mind
he
shouldered
his
gun
and
set
off
up
the
road
in
the
direction
from
which
the
horse
came
he
moved
along
at
a
rapid
trot
looking
everywhere
for
the
dismounted
but
he
would
certainly
have
passed
him
if
he
had
been
alone
the
dogs
were
the
first
to
discover
him
after
hopkins
had
run
about
half
a
mile
dandy
and
punch
who
were
fifty
yards
in
advance
of
him
suddenly
stopped
and
began
barking
at
something
in
the
boy
could
not
see
what
it
was
for
the
bushes
concealed
it
from
his
view
believing
from
the
actions
of
the
dogs
that
they
had
found
a
wild
animal
of
some
kind
hopkins
cocked
both
barrels
of
his
gun
and
walked
slowly
along
the
road
until
he
came
opposite
the
fence
corner
but
still
he
could
see
nothing
he
tried
to
send
the
dogs
into
the
bushes
but
they
positively
refused
to
go
they
barked
loudly
and
looked
very
savage
but
kept
close
to
hopkins
for
protection
i
don
t
much
like
the
idea
of
going
in
there
myself
thought
the
young
hunter
for
there
are
such
things
as
bears
panthers
and
in
this
country
and
neither
do
i
like
to
go
on
without
having
a
shot
at
that
varmint
whatever
it
may
be
i
won
t
either
i
am
going
to
see
what
it
his
gun
was
loaded
with
heavy
shot
and
hopkins
had
the
utmost
confidence
in
his
skill
as
a
marksman
having
fully
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
not
be
driven
from
the
field
by
an
invisible
enemy
he
walked
cautiously
toward
the
bushes
stooping
down
now
and
then
to
peer
into
them
the
pointers
kept
pace
with
him
and
finally
dandy
who
must
have
discovered
something
that
set
his
fears
at
rest
made
a
sudden
bound
and
disappeared
in
the
thicket
no
sooner
was
he
out
of
sight
than
his
barking
ceased
and
when
hopkins
parted
the
bushes
with
one
hand
holding
his
gun
in
the
other
in
readiness
for
a
shot
he
saw
the
pointer
licking
the
face
of
the
who
was
lying
on
the
ground
so
effectually
gagged
with
a
stick
that
he
could
not
speak
and
so
tightly
wrapped
up
in
ropes
that
he
could
move
neither
hand
nor
foot
hopkins
was
horrified
as
almost
any
boy
would
have
been
under
the
same
circumstances
although
the
thicket
was
pretty
dark
the
hunter
recognized
david
as
readily
as
he
had
recognized
his
horse
and
he
thought
at
first
that
he
was
dead
but
when
his
optics
became
somewhat
accustomed
to
the
obscurity
he
saw
that
david
s
eyes
were
wide
open
and
that
they
were
turned
toward
him
with
a
most
appealing
expression
well
this
is
a
little
ahead
of
any
thing
i
ever
heard
of
said
hopkins
who
was
profoundly
astonished
what
are
you
doing
there
david
made
an
effort
to
reply
but
the
stick
that
was
tied
between
his
teeth
checked
his
utterance
then
it
appeared
to
dawn
upon
hopkins
that
possibly
the
captive
would
be
grateful
for
a
little
assistance
and
he
proceeded
to
give
it
without
further
loss
of
time
letting
down
the
hammers
of
his
gun
he
laid
the
weapon
on
the
ground
pulled
his
knife
from
his
pocket
and
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
write
it
david
was
relieved
of
both
gag
and
bonds
and
placed
upon
his
feet
i
have
been
robbed
he
gasped
as
soon
as
he
could
speak
i
suspected
as
much
replied
hopkins
calmly
it
could
not
have
happened
so
very
long
no
i
suppose
not
the
men
have
not
been
gone
more
than
ten
minutes
probably
but
it
seems
as
though
i
had
been
a
prisoner
here
for
an
very
likely
did
you
recognize
the
robbers
i
did
not
i
am
quite
sure
i
never
saw
them
before
they
had
made
an
attempt
to
disguise
themselves
as
negroes
but
i
could
see
their
white
skins
through
the
black
on
their
faces
very
well
come
on
said
hopkins
there
s
no
use
in
standing
here
and
allowing
them
to
get
away
with
their
plunder
tell
me
all
about
it
as
we
go
there
s
not
much
to
tell
answered
david
after
he
and
hopkins
had
worked
their
way
out
of
the
bushes
to
the
road
i
was
jogging
along
at
a
lively
pace
never
dreaming
of
danger
when
the
first
thing
i
knew
three
men
jumped
out
of
the
bushes
and
halted
me
one
pointed
a
cocked
rifle
straight
at
my
head
another
seized
my
horse
by
the
bits
while
the
third
pulled
me
and
the
to
the
ground
then
the
man
who
was
holding
my
horse
let
him
i
saw
him
said
hopkins
and
that
was
a
very
lucky
thing
for
you
i
lost
my
way
and
while
i
was
sitting
on
the
fence
trying
to
make
up
my
mind
which
end
of
this
road
i
ought
to
take
in
order
to
reach
the
landing
your
horse
went
by
i
supposed
he
had
thrown
you
and
so
i
came
on
to
see
if
i
could
do
anything
for
and
very
grateful
i
am
to
you
for
it
said
david
warmly
of
course
that
s
all
understood
but
the
credit
belongs
to
your
horse
and
to
don
gordon
s
pointers
if
i
hadn
t
seen
the
horse
i
should
not
have
known
that
anything
had
happened
to
you
and
if
punch
and
dandy
had
not
been
with
me
i
should
have
gone
right
by
that
thicket
of
bushes
without
once
suspecting
that
there
was
anybody
hidden
there
well
proceed
the
man
let
your
horse
what
then
they
all
jumped
on
me
and
before
i
fully
comprehended
the
situation
i
was
helpless
and
speechless
they
turned
my
pockets
inside
out
but
the
only
thing
they
found
in
them
that
was
worth
stealing
was
my
revolver
one
of
them
grabbed
that
and
the
and
made
off
with
them
while
the
other
two
carried
me
into
the
bushes
and
left
me
did
they
make
much
of
a
haul
asked
hopkins
i
can
t
answer
that
question
for
i
don
t
know
what
there
was
in
the
if
they
had
robbed
me
a
few
days
ago
that
is
on
the
fifteenth
they
would
have
got
something
to
pay
them
for
their
trouble
for
i
had
in
my
pocket
seven
hundred
dollars
of
silas
jones
s
money
that
i
brought
from
the
county
seat
for
they
would
have
secured
something
else
also
and
that
was
a
check
that
was
worth
five
thousand
dollars
to
brigham
but
which
would
have
been
of
no
more
value
to
the
robbers
than
so
much
waste
paper
the
however
was
not
aware
of
that
fact
and
if
lester
brigham
had
only
been
wise
enough
to
keep
his
own
counsel
no
one
in
the
settlement
except
those
interested
would
have
known
that
david
was
ever
intrusted
with
money
or
its
equivalent
i
ll
never
carry
any
more
funds
for
anybody
said
david
choking
back
a
sob
indeed
i
don
t
suppose
i
shall
ever
have
another
why
not
asked
hopkins
you
are
in
no
way
to
blame
for
of
your
i
know
it
and
i
am
very
glad
indeed
that
i
was
not
found
and
released
by
any
one
who
lives
in
the
settlement
as
you
are
a
stranger
here
you
are
of
course
neither
a
friend
nor
an
enemy
to
me
and
consequently
you
can
have
no
object
in
defending
or
condemning
what
do
you
mean
by
that
i
mean
just
this
there
is
no
one
in
the
neighborhood
who
has
warmer
friends
and
more
bitter
enemies
than
i
have
i
know
that
my
friends
will
stand
by
me
in
my
trouble
but
there
are
a
good
many
in
the
settlement
who
will
say
that
i
wasn
t
robbed
at
i
stole
the
mail
and
made
up
a
story
to
cover
my
guilt
i
am
neither
blind
nor
deaf
and
i
can
put
my
hand
on
a
dozen
men
and
boys
who
are
watching
for
a
chance
to
throw
me
out
of
my
position
so
that
they
can
apply
for
it
themselves
no
one
ever
thought
the
s
berth
was
worth
anything
until
i
got
it
and
now
everybody
wants
let
em
want
said
hopkins
encouragingly
you
have
nothing
to
fear
so
long
as
you
retain
the
confidence
of
don
s
father
we
ll
go
and
see
him
the
first
thing
being
a
magistrate
he
will
of
course
know
just
how
to
go
to
work
to
find
and
arrest
those
the
boy
s
confidence
in
general
gordon
was
not
misplaced
but
it
is
doubtful
if
that
gentleman
with
all
his
shrewdness
could
have
effected
the
capture
of
the
robbers
as
easily
as
he
did
had
it
not
been
for
the
fact
that
the
don
obtained
a
clue
for
him
from
a
most
unexpected
quarter
we
left
don
and
his
friends
sitting
in
their
cosy
room
at
the
waiting
for
supper
which
was
served
in
due
time
curtis
and
egan
were
astonished
at
the
quantity
and
variety
of
the
viands
which
old
cuff
spread
before
them
and
paid
the
highest
possible
compliment
to
his
skill
as
a
cook
and
caterer
by
eating
until
they
could
find
room
for
no
more
when
he
pushed
his
chair
away
from
the
table
after
trying
in
vain
to
dispose
of
the
last
piece
of
roast
duck
that
cuff
had
placed
before
him
egan
declared
that
he
never
could
go
to
bed
after
such
a
supper
as
that
and
proposed
that
they
should
make
another
effort
to
find
out
where
hopkins
was
don
said
he
thought
it
would
be
a
good
plan
so
egan
took
down
his
filled
one
of
his
pockets
with
cartridges
and
started
for
the
door
just
as
he
opened
it
the
report
of
a
gun
fired
twice
in
rapid
succession
came
echoing
across
the
lake
it
sounded
from
the
direction
of
godfrey
evans
s
cabin
there
he
is
now
said
bert
in
order
to
make
sure
of
it
curtis
set
up
a
very
fair
imitation
of
a
he
and
the
rest
of
the
academy
boys
had
been
practicing
on
it
ever
since
the
indians
made
the
attack
on
their
camp
and
before
the
echoes
it
awakened
had
wholly
died
away
an
answering
whoop
came
from
the
other
side
of
the
water
it
hop
said
don
as
he
ran
into
the
cabin
after
his
cap
shove
off
the
fellows
and
pile
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
had
been
launched
and
pulled
across
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
lake
hopkins
was
not
at
the
landing
to
meet
them
so
the
boat
s
painter
was
made
fast
to
a
tree
and
don
and
the
rest
started
toward
godfrey
s
cabin
by
the
aid
of
the
light
which
streamed
through
the
open
door
don
could
see
that
his
friend
was
standing
in
the
yard
that
david
and
his
mother
were
with
him
and
that
all
three
appeared
to
be
conversing
earnestly
with
a
horseman
who
had
just
stopped
there
when
the
latter
saw
don
and
his
party
approaching
he
put
spurs
to
his
nag
and
galloped
away
what
did
i
tell
you
hopkins
said
david
bitterly
there
are
twenty
men
and
more
in
this
settlement
who
believe
just
as
owens
what
s
the
trouble
here
inquired
don
and
what
does
owens
believe
o
don
it
s
dreadful
cried
evans
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
and
sinking
down
upon
the
bench
beside
the
door
to
think
that
my
david
should
ever
be
accused
of
such
a
crime
the
trouble
is
that
the
mail
has
been
stolen
said
hopkins
and
owens
who
was
ordered
out
by
the
constable
to
assist
in
raising
a
hue
and
cry
after
the
robbers
has
just
been
down
here
to
comfort
david
with
the
assurance
that
he
doesn
t
believe
a
word
of
his
he
had
the
impudence
to
tell
me
to
my
face
that
i
was
the
thief
exclaimed
david
hotly
he
said
that
when
i
first
began
to
ride
the
route
he
told
several
people
about
here
that
that
mail
would
get
into
trouble
through
me
sooner
or
later
and
he
seems
delighted
to
find
that
his
prediction
has
been
cried
don
who
was
utterly
astounded
while
the
rest
of
the
party
no
less
astonished
and
bewildered
crowded
up
closer
to
the
speaker
in
order
to
catch
every
word
i
don
t
wonder
that
you
are
surprised
said
hopkins
so
was
i
when
i
found
him
back
there
in
the
country
bound
and
gagged
and
laid
away
in
a
fence
corner
owens
declares
that
david
tied
himself
but
i
know
what
are
you
trying
to
get
at
anyhow
exclaimed
bert
that
s
what
i
d
like
to
know
chimed
in
don
now
dave
begin
at
the
beginning
and
tell
your
story
so
that
we
can
understand
david
complied
and
for
a
few
minutes
held
his
auditors
after
he
had
described
how
the
robbers
had
tied
his
hands
and
feet
and
concealed
him
in
the
bushes
hopkins
took
up
the
narrative
and
told
his
part
of
it
adding
that
he
and
david
had
gone
straight
to
the
general
who
after
listening
to
their
story
took
immediate
steps
to
effect
the
capture
of
the
robbers
but
i
am
very
much
afraid
that
he
will
never
find
them
said
hopkins
he
acknowledged
that
he
didn
t
suspect
anybody
and
david
says
he
never
saw
the
men
before
besides
they
were
disguised
as
i
don
t
care
for
that
said
don
i
know
who
did
it
and
so
do
you
stay
here
to
the
surprise
of
all
his
companions
don
walked
with
a
firm
and
rapid
step
straight
into
the
cabin
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
a
moment
later
a
frightened
scream
came
from
the
inside
followed
by
the
go
way
don
go
way
i
tell
ye
i
didn
t
tuk
sw
ar
i
didn
t
an
if
you
lay
an
ugly
hand
onto
me
i
ll
make
daylight
shine
through
you
as
just
then
a
rifle
cracked
and
the
cabin
shook
all
over
as
some
heavy
body
fell
violently
to
the
floor
these
alarming
sounds
seemed
to
freeze
the
blood
in
the
veins
of
those
who
listened
to
them
the
boys
were
struck
dumb
and
motionless
with
horror
while
evans
wrung
her
hands
silently
for
a
moment
and
then
fell
off
the
bench
in
a
dead
faint
they
knew
instinctively
what
had
happened
inside
the
cabin
bert
was
the
first
to
recover
his
power
of
action
he
ran
for
the
door
but
it
would
not
open
for
him
when
don
closed
it
he
had
pulled
in
the
so
that
his
companions
could
not
follow
him
stand
out
of
the
way
bert
cried
hopkins
and
give
me
a
chance
at
so
saying
hopkins
backed
off
a
few
paces
and
launched
his
hundred
and
eighty
pounds
against
the
door
with
all
the
force
he
could
command
the
weak
wooden
hinges
gave
way
beneath
his
weight
and
the
door
landed
in
the
middle
of
the
cabin
with
hopkins
on
top
of
it
bert
and
the
rest
crowded
in
as
soon
as
the
way
was
opened
for
them
and
although
their
fears
were
instantly
allayed
by
the
scene
that
was
presented
to
their
gaze
their
wonder
was
greatly
increased
dan
evans
was
lying
flat
upon
his
back
and
don
gordon
was
holding
him
down
with
the
greatest
ease
in
spite
of
dan
s
frantic
efforts
to
get
up
o
don
cried
bert
did
he
hit
you
no
was
the
encouraging
reply
i
am
all
right
you
fellows
go
out
please
and
leave
us
alone
i
want
to
ask
dan
a
few
the
boys
mechanically
obeyed
looking
inquiringly
at
one
another
and
shaking
their
heads
as
if
to
say
that
all
attempts
at
explanation
would
be
useless
the
whole
proceeding
was
a
deep
mystery
and
so
it
would
remain
until
don
was
ready
to
clear
it
up
chapter
xvii
conclusion
while
don
was
listening
to
the
story
of
the
robbery
as
related
by
david
and
hopkins
he
stood
in
such
a
position
that
he
could
look
through
the
open
door
of
the
cabin
and
command
a
view
of
the
interior
there
was
no
one
in
there
except
dan
evans
who
instead
of
coming
out
to
hear
the
story
as
almost
any
boy
would
have
done
kept
his
seat
by
the
fireplace
the
light
shone
full
upon
him
and
don
could
see
that
he
was
ill
at
ease
he
cast
furtive
glances
toward
the
excited
group
in
front
of
the
door
twisted
nervously
about
on
his
chair
and
acted
altogether
as
if
he
felt
very
miserable
don
was
surprised
at
first
and
finally
he
became
suspicious
that
fellow
knows
more
about
this
afternoon
s
work
than
any
of
us
said
he
to
himself
he
doesn
t
act
that
way
without
some
good
reason
i
believe
it
will
pay
to
ask
him
a
few
the
sequel
proved
that
our
hero
had
struck
a
warm
trail
the
very
first
time
trying
when
dan
found
himself
shut
up
in
the
cabin
and
don
gordon
standing
between
him
and
the
door
and
cutting
off
his
only
way
of
escape
he
became
terribly
alarmed
and
confessed
his
guilt
without
waiting
to
be
questioned
scarcely
realizing
what
he
was
doing
he
broke
out
into
loud
protestations
of
innocence
and
seizing
his
rifle
which
stood
in
the
corner
behind
him
declared
that
he
would
shoot
the
intruder
if
the
latter
laid
a
hand
upon
him
the
threat
was
by
no
means
an
idle
one
dan
fully
intended
to
carry
it
out
but
fortunately
for
him
and
all
concerned
he
had
to
deal
with
one
who
always
kept
a
level
head
upon
his
shoulders
before
dan
had
fairly
ceased
speaking
don
sprang
clear
across
the
cabin
with
one
bound
seized
the
threatening
rifle
with
one
hand
laid
hold
of
dan
s
collar
with
the
other
and
bringing
all
his
strength
and
skill
into
play
threw
him
to
the
floor
with
the
greatest
violence
in
the
struggle
the
rifle
was
discharged
but
the
bullet
passed
harmlessly
through
the
roof
a
few
seconds
later
some
heavy
body
came
against
the
door
which
was
broken
from
its
hinges
and
don
s
companions
came
hurrying
in
expecting
to
find
him
wounded
or
dead
they
did
not
see
how
it
could
be
otherwise
for
there
was
not
a
better
in
the
settlement
than
dan
evans
don
quickly
set
their
fears
at
rest
by
assuring
them
that
he
was
all
right
and
at
his
request
the
boys
went
out
again
leaving
him
alone
with
his
captive
now
dan
what
do
you
know
about
this
miserable
business
said
don
as
soon
as
his
friends
had
left
the
cabin
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
that
it
will
be
better
for
you
if
you
tell
the
truth
dave
is
backed
up
by
the
whole
united
states
government
and
the
fellows
who
waylaid
him
are
bound
to
be
captured
they
can
not
possibly
i
m
a
hoss
in
the
cane
an
hard
to
curry
replied
dan
by
which
he
meant
that
he
was
one
who
could
not
be
easily
conquered
in
order
to
prove
the
truth
of
his
assertion
he
began
struggling
desperately
but
don
seized
him
by
both
wrists
and
crossing
his
arms
upon
his
breast
held
him
as
if
he
had
been
screwed
up
in
a
vise
answer
my
questions
and
then
you
can
get
up
said
don
calmly
refuse
and
i
will
take
you
before
my
father
who
will
put
you
in
the
calaboose
as
an
accomplice
in
this
don
said
bert
thrusting
his
head
in
at
the
door
mrs
evans
says
that
dan
has
been
at
home
all
the
afternoon
so
of
course
he
could
have
had
no
hand
in
stealing
the
no
i
didn
t
don
i
sw
ar
i
didn
t
exclaimed
dan
who
finding
that
resistance
was
useless
began
to
shed
tears
copiously
i
didn
t
tech
that
thar
i
haven
t
said
that
you
did
answered
don
but
you
know
who
did
touch
it
and
i
want
you
to
tell
me
all
about
it

i
reckon

whined
dan
who

shootin
when

mornin
he

that
thar
that

tied

river
i
thought
so
from
the
first
said
don
to
himself
i
knew
those
vagabonds
would
raise
some
kind
of
a
row
before
they
then
aloud
he
added
how
do
you
know
that
they
were
in
the
when
i
went
there
this
morning
kase
i
was
an
lester
lester
brigham
repeated
don
yes

an
him
goes
huntin
a
most
every
don
was
profoundly
astonished
he
told
himself
that
lester
must
be
getting
very
low
down
in
the
world
if
he
were
willing
to
make
a
daily
companion
of
so
worthless
a
fellow
as
dan
evans
well
this
thing
was
all
cut
and
dried
wasn
t
it
said
he
you
planned
the
robbery
and
barlow
and
his
two
friends

the
work

that
the
way
of
it
i

dan
don
t
hold
me
so
tight
don
an
i
ll

what
s
the
gospel
truth
lester
he
told
me
that
dave

in
right
smart
of
money
for
his
pap
every
month
an
i
told

of

he
said

so

he

like
rich
folks
do
that
s
all
i
done
don
sure

yer
bright
an
hope

if

to
barlow
about

halvers
with
you
nary
word
don
nary
blessed
don
didn
t
believe
this
for
dan
was
almost
too
earnest
in
his
denial
but
he
had
obtained
a
clue
and
that
was
what
he
wanted
dan
said
he
throwing
all
the
emphasis
he
could
into
his
words
you
had
better
take
my
advice
and
stay
right
here
at
home
and
mind
your
own
business
until
this
thing
is
settled
you
will
get
yourself
into
trouble
if
you
don
t
now
do
as
you
so
saying
he
helped
dan
to
his
feet
and
joined
his
friends
in
front
of
the
cabin
he
spoke
encouragingly
to
evans
who
was
sobbing
violently
assured
david
that
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
be
so
and
started
for
his
followed
by
his
companions
of
course
the
latter
were
full
of
questions
they
had
heard
all
that
passed
in
the
cabin
and
knew
that
dan
evans
and
lester
brigham
were
in
a
measure
responsible
for
the
robbery
but
what
had
put
it
into
don
s
head
to
accuse
dan
that
was
something
they
could
not
understand
dan
gave
himself
away
by
his
actions
said
don
in
explanation
that
s
the
whole
secret
of
the
matter
but
i
don
t
know
what
is
to
become
of
those
two
boys
lester
can
t
get
much
lower
by
land
and
as
for
ll
end
his
days
in
the
penitentiary
if
he
keeps
on
he
meant
to
shoot
me
i
could
see
it
in
his
eye
now
we
ll
go
home
and
tell
father
all
about
propelled
by
four
oars
the
moved
swiftly
through
the
water
and
at
the
end
of
twenty
minutes
she
was
made
fast
to
the
jetty
and
the
boys
were
on
their
way
to
the
house
when
they
reached
the
back
porch
they
found
three
horses
hitched
there
and
general
gordon
in
conversation
with
the
constable
and
godfrey
evans
the
latter
was
stamping
about
in
a
great
rage
flourishing
his
arms
over
his
head
and
acting
like
one
demented
why
what
brings
you
boys
here
asked
the
general
we
have
news
for
you
replied
don
who
then
went
on
to
give
a
circumstantial
account
of
the
incidents
that
had
just
transpired
at
godfrey
s
cabin
godfrey
could
hardly
believe
his
ears
when
he
learned
that
dan
was
one
of
the
indirect
causes
of
the
robbery
he
jumped
up
knocked
his
heels
together
and
uttered
a
yell
that
could
have
been
heard
a
mile
away
gen
ral
said
he
picking
up
his
rifle
which
he
had
laid
upon
the
porch
i
ll
go

an
take

cowhide
an

larrup
that
thar
calm
yourself
godfrey
interrupted
the
general
you
will
only
make
matters
worse
if
you
do
that
what
do
you
advise
ross
he
added
turning
to
the
constable
is
there
any
way
to
get
don
s
out
of
the
lake
into
the
river
asked
the
officer
of
course
there
is
answered
don
we
can
row
her
up
the
pass
and
drag
her
over
the
levee
she
s
heavy
but
we
have
the
force
here
to
do
then
my
advice
is
that
we
find
and
search
that
at
once
said
the
constable
mr
don
you
would
make
a
the
general
went
into
the
house
to
make
out
a
and
the
boys
hurried
back
to
the
jetty
to
put
the
in
readiness
for
her
trip
down
the
river
as
the
mast
had
been
stepped
that
morning
the
bowsprit
put
in
the
sails
bent
on
and
the
running
rigging
rove
all
they
had
to
do
was
to
loosen
the
canvas
and
select
those
who
were
to
pull
the
oars
there
s
a
splendid
breeze
on
said
don
who
had
never
been
able
to
make
up
his
mind
which
he
liked
riding
or
shooting
it
blows
right
down
the
river
too
we
can
t
sail
out
because
the
pass
is
so
narrow
but
when
we
get
out
into
the
mississippi
will
go
flying
now
then
why
doesn
t
father
come
the
general
was
making
out
a
warrant
empowering
the
constable
to
search
the
when
they
found
it
and
then
he
lingered
to
unsaddle
the
horses
which
he
had
brought
out
for
his
own
use
and
godfrey
s
when
these
duties
had
been
performed
he
and
godfrey
and
the
constable
came
down
to
the
jetty
and
took
their
seats
in
the
which
was
promptly
pushed
off
and
headed
up
the
pass
half
an
hour
sufficed
for
the
oarsmen
to
bring
her
to
the
levee
over
which
she
was
hauled
without
the
least
trouble
then
came
another
short
stretch
through
which
she
was
propelled
by
the
oars
and
as
soon
as
she
was
fairly
out
of
the
pass
and
began
to
feel
the
force
of
the
wind
and
the
current
the
oars
were
drawn
in
don
seated
himself
at
the
helm
bert
with
fred
and
joe
packard
s
assistance
hoisted
the
sails
the
sheets
were
let
out
and
the
pursuit
was
begun
keep
as
close
in
to
shore
as
you
can
don
said
bert
it
s
pretty
dark
and
we
may
pass
her
before
we
know
you
don
t
expect
to
see
that
where
you
found
her
this
morning
do
you
said
don
it
s
eleven
o
clock
isn
t
it
well
she
is
twenty
miles
down
the
river
by
this
time
keep
a
bright
for
lights
everybody
we
don
t
want
to
let
some
steamboat
run
us
down
before
we
know
although
he
knew
he
was
wasting
time
in
doing
it
don
kept
the
boat
as
close
to
the
bank
as
he
could
with
safety
but
nothing
was
to
be
seen
of
the
piratical
craft
of
which
they
were
in
search
when
bert
announced
that
they
had
passed
the
place
where
she
had
been
moored
in
the
morning
don
drew
in
the
sheets
a
little
and
held
the
boat
s
head
diagonally
across
the
river
in
order
to
strike
the
stronger
current
of
the
channel
then
the
began
to
show
the
speed
of
which
she
was
capable
and
then
too
the
general
enjoined
silence
upon
all
her
occupants
the
night
is
comparatively
quiet
said
he
and
the
rattling
of
an
oar
or
a
word
spoken
in
a
loud
tone
of
voice
can
be
heard
a
long
distance
we
have
one
advantage
over
the
crew
of
that
we
can
get
out
of
the
way
of
a
steamboat
and
they
can
t
so
they
will
have
to
carry
lights
for
their
under
don
s
skillful
management
the
little
boat
flew
swiftly
along
keeping
in
the
channel
when
her
course
was
clear
and
making
all
haste
to
get
out
of
it
as
often
as
the
vigilant
announced
that
there
were
lights
ahead
two
hours
passed
and
nothing
had
been
seen
of
the
i
reckon
we
ve
missed
her
said
the
constable
she
has
tied
up
to
the
bank
somewhere
and
we
have
run
by
her
in
the
if
that
is
the
case
there
is
only
one
thing
we
can
do
said
don
we
ll
keep
on
down
the
river
until
and
then
we
ll
come
about
and
beat
back
again
making
a
close
examination
of
each
shore
she
can
t
escape
us
unless
she
hauls
into
one
of
these
little
bayous
and
gets
out
of
sight
among
the
and
if
her
crew
know
the
river
and
are
at
all
sharp
that
is
just
what
they
will
do
said
the
constable
just
then
a
whistle
sounded
in
the
bend
below
them
and
instantly
the
conversation
ceased
and
everybody
was
on
the
alert
and
listening
with
all
his
ears
to
catch
the
reply
it
came
at
length
but
it
was
not
a
whistle
it
was
a
prolonged
blast
from
a
tin
horn
there
was
a
commotion
among
the
boys
and
their
excitement
arose
to
fever
heat
there
she
is
said
bert
confidently
don
t
be
too
hasty
in
jumping
at
conclusions
said
his
father
in
a
quiet
tone
there
s
a
in
the
bend
below
us
and
i
am
sure
of
it
answered
bert
so
am
i
but
still
it
may
not
be
the
one
we
want
to
find
there
is
more
than
one
on
this
river
you
don
brought
his
boat
close
to
the
wind
and
went
scudding
across
the
river
to
get
out
of
the
steamer
s
way
he
held
well
over
toward
the
eastern
shore
and
when
he
stood
off
on
the
other
tack
the
steamer
had
passed
and
bert
announced
in
a
low
tone
that
there
were
lights
straight
ahead
they
were
close
to
the
water
and
the
s
crew
had
but
one
opinion
concerning
them
they
belonged
to
a
but
whether
or
not
it
was
the
one
of
which
they
were
in
pursuit
was
a
question
that
only
time
could
solve
lay
us
aboard
of
her
without
any
ceremony
said
the
general
bert
stand
by
with
the
we
must
move
quickly
and
give
them
no
chance
to
throw
the
mail
overboard
if
they
have
got
don
kept
the
bow
of
his
little
craft
pointed
toward
the
and
so
silently
did
she
move
through
the
water
that
the
man
who
stood
at
the
keeping
a
sharp
in
front
of
him
but
never
thinking
to
look
behind
was
entirely
unconscious
of
her
approach
presently
bert
reached
for
the
at
the
same
time
giving
a
nod
that
everybody
understood
a
few
minutes
more
would
decide
whether
they
were
on
the
right
track
or
not
bert
stood
up
in
his
place
don
at
a
sign
from
his
father
paid
out
the
rapidly
thus
bringing
his
craft
broadside
to
the
and
just
then
the
man
at
the
awoke
from
his
reverie
and
turned
quickly
about
keep
away
there
he
shouted
in
great
alarm
keep
away
or
you
ll
sink
don
did
not
want
to
sink
the
but
he
wanted
to
come
alongside
of
her
and
he
did
it
a
moment
later
in
a
very
creditable
manner
the
instant
the
two
boats
touched
general
gordon
and
his
party
sprang
over
the
side
and
ran
into
the
cabin
some
going
in
at
the
back
door
and
the
others
at
the
front
leaving
don
and
bert
to
act
as
and
to
keep
the
boats
from
drifting
apart
the
man
at
the
was
captured
by
egan
who
stood
guard
over
him
with
his
and
barlow
and
his
companion
who
were
busy
in
the
cabin
were
covered
by
the
constable
s
revolver
and
godfrey
evans
s
rifle
before
they
had
time
to
think
of
their
weapons
this
looks
like
business
said
the
officer
handing
his
to
fred
packard
and
drawing
three
pairs
of
handcuffs
from
his
pocket
the
others
thought
so
too
david
s
lay
upon
the
would
never
carry
it
again
for
it
had
been
ruined
by
being
cut
open
with
a
its
contents
were
scattered
about
over
the
floor
and
in
the
bunks
the
most
of
the
letters
had
been
torn
open
and
the
robbers
had
reaped
a
very
fair
reward
for
their
trouble
having
secured
about
forty
dollars
in
greenbacks
and
a
check
for
three
hundred
dollars
drawn
by
a
country
merchant
in
favor
of
his
creditors
in
memphis
the
general
took
charge
of
the
bills
and
the
check
while
the
constable
lost
no
time
in
putting
the
irons
on
barlow
and
his
confederate
where
s
the
other
said
he
there
ought
to
be
three
of
here
he
is
said
egan
who
marched
his
prisoner
into
the
cabin
and
turned
him
over
to
the
officer
at
the
same
time
making
a
sergeant
s
salute
as
he
would
if
he
had
been
at
the
academy
i
told
you
jest
how
it
would
be
said
the
steersman
glaring
savagely
at
barlow
as
he
felt
the
cold
handcuffs
clasped
about
his
wrists
why
didn
t
you
hide
as
i
wanted
you
to
do
instead
of
trying
to
run
you
would
have
showed
a
little
more
sense
if
you
had
done
that
said
the
constable
but
on
the
whole
we
are
very
well
satisfied
now
keep
still
all
of
you
he
added
shaking
his
finger
at
the
women
who
having
checked
their
loud
lamentations
now
showed
a
disposition
to
become
abusive
godfrey
keep
your
eye
on
these
men
until
they
are
safe
under
lock
and
godfrey
was
just
the
one
for
this
business
there
was
only
one
thing
that
would
have
suited
him
better
and
that
was
an
order
to
punch
the
prisoners
heads
for
the
first
time
his
eyes
were
opened
to
the
fact
that
david
was
a
great
help
to
the
family
and
that
the
loss
of
his
position
as
would
be
a
serious
blow
to
all
of
them
if
me
an
dan
would
only
wake
up
an
woke
up
we
d
get
along
well
enough
he
said
to
himself
as
he
leaned
on
his
long
rifle
and
looked
thoughtfully
at
the
floor
dave
s
doin
his
shar
an
me
an
that
lazy
dan
has
got
to
do
our
n
from
this
day

that

that
he
has
plenty
to

in
futur
i
bet
while
general
gordon
and
the
constable
were
gathering
up
the
mail
and
putting
it
into
the
bag
they
had
much
to
talk
about
they
had
secured
the
robbers
and
the
next
thing
was
to
get
them
back
to
rochdale
they
had
about
decided
that
they
would
tie
the
to
the
bank
and
take
the
prisoners
up
the
river
in
the
when
curtis
came
in
to
say
that
there
were
lights
below
them
whereupon
the
general
picked
up
barlow
s
horn
and
went
out
to
answer
the
steamer
s
signals
this
having
been
done
he
waited
for
her
to
come
abreast
of
the
she
proved
to
be
a
large
with
a
tow
of
empty
coal
barges
steamer
ahoy
shouted
the
general
hallo
responded
a
man
who
was
standing
on
the
near
the
bell
what
steamer
is
that
the
b
no
of
is
that
you
captain
pratt
yes
but
that
can
t
be
you
the
general
replied
that
it
he
and
upon
receiving
this
reply
the
captain
raised
his
hand
the
pilot
rang
the
and
the
steamer
s
wheel
hung
motionless
in
the
water
why
gordon
what
in
the
world
are
you
doing
here
at
this
hour
in
the
morning
demanded
the
captain
can
t
stop
to
explain
now
answered
the
will
you
give
us
a
lift
as
far
as
rochdale
of
course
i
will
can
you
bring
that
tub
of
yours
alongside
they
could
and
they
did
the
sails
were
hauled
down
instantly
the
oars
were
manned
and
the
was
hauled
over
and
made
fast
to
the
stern
of
the
steamer
s
tow
then
the
general
went
on
board
the
steamer
to
explain
matters
to
captain
pratt
while
the
boys
lingered
to
look
after
the
safety
of
the
having
tied
her
to
one
of
the
barges
so
that
she
would
ride
easily
they
followed
the
general
on
board
the
b
and
seated
themselves
on
the
to
talk
over
the
exciting
events
of
the
night
every
one
of
them
gave
don
gordon
great
credit
for
what
he
had
done
if
he
had
not
been
sharp
enough
to
see
guilt
in
dan
evans
s
face
and
actions
there
was
no
knowing
when
the
robbers
would
have
been
captured
young
gemmen
said
the
negro
steward
won
t
you
step
into
de
cabin
an
hab
a
bite
of
lunch
you
mus
be
hungry
after
your
long
cold
the
boys
were
hungry
and
cold
too
although
they
did
not
know
it
until
that
moment
they
did
ample
justice
to
the
steward
s
lunch
and
also
to
his
breakfast
which
was
served
at
seven
o
clock
at
eight
they
passed
rochdale
and
half
an
hour
later
they
cast
loose
from
the
tow
and
began
the
work
of
pulling
their
clumsy
prize
and
its
occupants
to
the
landing
the
hue
and
cry
which
the
constable
had
raised
the
night
before
had
brought
the
loafers
and
the
neighboring
planters
out
in
full
force
and
there
was
a
large
crowd
to
welcome
them
as
they
went
ashore
with
their
prisoners
as
there
was
no
place
in
rochdale
in
which
the
robbers
could
be
confined
the
preliminary
examination
was
held
at
once
the
women
being
tried
as
accessories
they
all
pleaded
as
there
were
ten
witnesses
present
who
could
testify
that
the
stolen
mail
was
found
in
their
possession
and
david
evans
easily
identified
them
by
their
clothing
they
could
not
do
otherwise
half
an
hour
later
they
were
on
their
way
to
the
where
they
were
to
be
kept
in
jail
until
their
trial
came
off
when
they
and
their
guards
were
out
of
sight
general
gordon
and
his
party
which
included
david
evans
and
his
father
got
into
the
and
started
for
the
lake
i
didn
t
see
lester
and
dan
anywhere
said
bert
when
the
had
been
made
fast
to
the
jetty
and
david
and
godfrey
had
started
for
home
i
wonder
if
they
have
taken
to
the
i
should
think
they
would
want
to
go
there
or
somewhere
else
replied
don
but
if
judge
packard
thinks
their
presence
necessary
when
the
trial
comes
off
he
can
easily
find
means
to
make
them
show
themselves
godfrey
won
t
sleep
soundly
until
he
gets
his
hand
on
dan
s
collar
that
boy
will
have
to
work
hard
now
to
make
amends
for
what
he
has
the
boys
spent
an
hour
or
two
in
the
house
giving
gordon
and
her
daughters
a
graphic
account
of
their
night
s
experience
and
then
set
out
for
the
where
a
cordial
welcome
and
a
hot
dinner
awaited
them
old
cuff
had
passed
the
night
in
a
fever
of
suspense
but
like
the
faithful
fellow
he
was
he
stuck
to
his
post
and
held
himself
in
readiness
to
defend
the
cabin
with
the
aid
of
the
hounds
and
a
big
club
if
barlow
and
his
friends
had
tried
to
burn
it
as
one
of
them
had
threatened
to
do
they
would
have
got
themselves
into
business
the
incidents
we
have
just
described
were
by
no
means
the
only
interesting
or
exciting
ones
that
happened
while
egan
curtis
and
hopkins
remained
at
the
the
boys
shot
until
they
were
tired
of
the
sport
and
frequently
entertained
their
friends
both
male
and
female
who
came
over
to
see
how
they
were
getting
on
they
drove
the
ridges
for
deer
hunted
wild
turkeys
and
ate
many
a
dinner
of
quails
that
hopkins
shot
for
them
over
don
gordon
s
pointers
it
was
a
fortunate
thing
for
david
evans
that
hopkins
got
lost
the
first
time
he
went
quail
hunting
for
the
story
he
told
and
the
results
that
came
of
it
effectually
silenced
those
who
had
hoped
to
prove
that
david
stole
the
mail
himself
the
days
flew
on
and
in
a
short
seemed
a
very
short
time
to
all
of
s
guests
began
to
talk
of
going
home
they
all
dreaded
the
separation
for
they
had
become
very
much
attached
to
one
another
but
it
won
t
be
for
any
great
length
of
time
fellows
said
curtis
the
members
of
our
happy
family
will
all
come
together
again
on
the
fifteenth
of
except
fred
and
joe
and
i
really
wish
they
were
coming
the
next
time
we
go
hunting
it
will
be
in
the
wilds
of
maine
i
can
t
promise
that
we
shall
have
a
chase
after
but
i
may
be
able
to
show
you
a
moose
and
you
southerners
will
have
a
chance
to
try
your
hands
at
something
that
will
be
entirely
new
to
mean
we
shall
have
just
enough
of
that
to
let
you
see
what
a
five
or
trout
can
do
when
he
makes
up
his
mind
to
fight
i
assure
you
that
i
shall
try
by
every
means
in
my
power
to
make
your
sojourn
with
me
as
pleasant
as
you
have
made
my
visit
the
parting
time
came
at
last
and
the
gray
eagle
took
don
s
guests
up
the
river
the
four
boys
they
left
behind
them
were
very
lonely
after
that
don
s
first
care
was
to
strip
the
and
lock
it
he
did
not
want
to
go
there
any
more
for
there
were
too
many
things
in
it
that
reminded
him
of
his
absent
friends
the
antlers
which
had
been
given
up
to
egan
for
the
exclusive
use
of
his
blunderbuss
the
and
that
curtis
had
fashioned
with
his
knife
the
which
had
given
away
with
a
great
crash
and
let
hopkins
down
upon
the
these
spoke
eloquently
of
the
days
that
were
gone
and
don
could
hardly
endure
the
sight
of
them
of
course
this
feeling
of
loneliness
wore
away
after
a
while
and
the
brothers
enjoyed
themselves
during
the
holidays
as
they
always
did
but
when
the
time
came
for
them
to
return
to
bridgeport
they
were
ready
and
waiting
their
second
year
at
the
academy
proved
to
be
an
eventful
one
some
things
happened
which
like
the
night
attack
of
the
mount

not
