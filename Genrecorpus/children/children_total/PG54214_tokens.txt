to
may
fore
word
you
have
heard
of
homer
and
of
the
two
wonderful
poems
the
iliad
and
the
odyssey
which
bear
his
name
no
one
knows
whether
these
poems
were
composed
by
homer
or
whether
they
are
the
work
of
many
different
poets
and
in
fact
it
matters
very
little
about
their
authorship
everybody
agrees
that
they
are
the
grandest
poems
ever
sung
or
written
or
read
in
this
world
and
yet
how
few
persons
comparatively
have
read
them
or
know
any
thing
about
them
except
at
homer
commences
his
story
not
at
the
beginning
but
in
the
midst
of
things
hence
when
one
starts
out
to
read
the
iliad
without
having
made
some
special
preparation
beforehand
he
finds
it
hard
to
understand
and
is
tempted
in
despair
to
stop
at
the
end
of
the
first
book
many
people
are
therefore
content
to
admire
the
great
masterpiece
of
poetry
and
simply
because
others
admire
it
and
not
because
they
have
any
personal
acquaintance
with
it
now
it
is
not
my
purpose
to
give
you
a
simplified
version
of
the
iliad
or
the
odyssey
there
are
already
many
such
versions
but
the
best
way
for
you
or
any
one
else
to
read
homer
is
read
if
you
do
not
understand
greek
you
can
read
him
in
one
of
the
many
english
translations
you
will
find
much
of
the
spirit
of
the
original
in
the
translations
by
bryant
by
lord
derby
and
by
old
george
chapman
as
well
as
in
the
admirable
prose
rendering
by
butcher
and
lang
but
you
can
get
none
of
it
in
any
simplified
version
my
object
in
writing
this
story
of
the
golden
age
has
been
to
pave
the
way
if
i
dare
say
it
to
an
enjoyable
reading
of
homer
either
in
translations
or
in
the
original
i
have
taken
the
various
legends
relating
to
the
causes
of
the
trojan
war
and
by
assuming
certain
privileges
never
yet
denied
to
have
woven
all
into
one
continuous
narrative
ending
where
homer
s
story
begins
the
hero
of
the
odyssey
a
character
not
always
to
be
admired
or
commended
is
my
hero
and
in
telling
the
story
of
his
boyhood
and
youth
i
have
taken
the
opportunity
to
repeat
for
your
enjoyment
some
of
the
most
beautiful
of
the
old
greek
myths
if
i
have
now
and
then
given
them
a
coloring
slightly
different
from
the
original
you
will
remember
that
such
is
the
right
of
the
the
poet
and
the
artist
the
essential
features
of
the
stories
remain
unchanged
i
have
all
along
drawn
freely
from
the
old
tragedians
and
now
and
then
from
homer
himself
nor
have
i
thought
it
necessary
in
every
instance
to
mention
authorities
or
to
apologize
for
an
occasional
close
imitation
of
some
of
the
best
translations
the
pictures
of
old
greek
life
have
in
the
main
been
derived
from
the
iliad
and
the
odyssey
and
will
i
hope
help
you
to
a
better
understanding
of
those
poems
when
you
come
to
make
acquaintance
directly
with
them
should
you
become
interested
in
the
story
of
the
golden
age
as
it
is
here
related
do
not
be
disappointed
by
its
somewhat
abrupt
ending
for
you
will
find
it
continued
by
the
of
all
ages
in
a
manner
both
inimitable
and
unapproachable
if
you
are
pleased
with
the
discourse

the

i
glimpse
of
the
world
to
the
folk
who
dwelt
in
that
island
three
thousand
years
ago
there
was
never
a
sweeter
spot
than
ithaca
rocky
and
rugged
though
it
may
have
seemed
yet
it
was
indeed
a
smiling
land
embosomed
in
the
laughing
sea
there
the
air
was
always
mild
and
pure
and
balmy
with
the
breath
of
blossoms
the
sun
looked
kindly
down
from
a
cloudless
sky
and
storms
seldom
broke
the
quiet
ripple
of
the
waters
which
bathed
the
shores
of
that
island
home
on
every
side
but
one
the
land
rose
straight
up
out
of
the
deep
sea
to
meet
the
feet
of
craggy
hills
and
mountains
crowned
with
woods
between
the
heights
were
many
narrow
dells
green
with
orchards
while
the
gentler
slopes
were
covered
with
vineyards
and
the
steeps
above
them
gave
pasturage
to
flocks
of
sheep
and
goats
on
that
side
of
the
island
which
lay
nearest
the
rising
sun
there
was
a
fine
deep
harbor
for
there
the
shore
bent
inward
and
only
a
narrow
neck
of
land
lay
between
the
eastern
waters
and
the
western
sea
close
on
either
side
of
this
harbor
arose
two
mountains
neritus
and
nereius
which
stood
like
giant
watchmen
overlooking
land
and
sea
and
warding
harm
away
and
on
the
neck
midway
between
these
mountains
was
the
king
s
white
palace
roomy
and
large
with
blossoming
orchards
to
the
right
and
the
left
and
broad
lawns
in
front
sloping
down
to
the
water
s
edge
here
many
hundreds
of
years
ago
lived
laertes
a
man
of
simple
habits
who
thought
his
little
island
home
a
kingdom
large
enough
and
never
sighed
for
a
greater
not
many
men
had
seen
so
much
of
the
world
as
he
for
he
had
been
to
colchis
with
jason
and
the
argonauts
and
his
feet
had
trod
the
streets
of
every
city
in
hellas
yet
in
all
his
wanderings
he
had
seen
no
fairer
land
than
rocky
ithaca
his
eyes
had
been
dazzled
by
the
brightness
of
the
golden
fleece
and
the
kings
of
argos
and
of
ilios
had
shown
him
the
gold
and
gems
of
their
yet
what
cared
he
for
wealth
other
than
that
which
his
flocks
and
vineyards
yielded
him
there
was
hardly
a
day
but
that
he
might
be
seen
in
the
fields
guiding
his
plough
or
training
his
vines
or
in
his
orchards
pruning
his
trees
or
gathering
the
mellow
fruit
he
had
all
the
good
gifts
of
life
that
any
man
needs
and
for
them
he
never
failed
to
thank
the
great
giver
nor
to
render
praises
to
the
powers
above
his
queen
fair
anticleia
daughter
of
the
aged
chief
autolycus
was
a
true
housewife
overseeing
the
maidens
at
their
tasks
busying
herself
with
the
distaff
and
the
spindle
or
plying
the
shuttle
at
the
loom
and
many
were
the
garments
rich
with
finest
needlework
which
her
own
fair
fingers
had
fashioned
to
laertes
and
anticleia
one
child
had
been
born
a
son
who
they
hoped
would
live
to
bring
renown
to
ithaca
this
boy
as
he
grew
became
strong
in
body
and
mind
far
beyond
his
playfellows
and
those
who
knew
him
wondered
at
the
shrewdness
of
his
speech
no
less
than
at
the
strength
and
suppleness
of
his
limbs
and
yet
he
was
small
of
stature
and
neither
in
face
nor
in
figure
was
he
adorned
with
any
of
apollo
s
grace
on
the
day
that
he
was
twelve
years
old
he
stood
with
his
tutor
the
bard
phemius
on
the
top
of
mount
neritus
below
him
spread
out
like
a
great
map
lay
what
was
to
him
the
whole
world
northward
as
far
as
his
eyes
could
see
there
were
islands
great
and
small
and
among
them
phemius
pointed
out
taphos
the
home
of
a
race
where
anchialus
chief
of
warriors
ruled
eastward
were
other
isles
and
the
shores
of
acarnania
so
far
away
that
they
seemed
mere
lines
of
hazy
green
between
the
purple
waters
and
the
azure
sky
southward
beyond
samos
were
the
wooded
heights
of
zacynthus
and
the
which
led
to
pylos
and
distant
crete
westward
was
the
great
sea
stretching
away
and
away
to
the
region
of
the
setting
sun
the
watery
kingdom
of
poseidon
full
of
strange
beings
and
unknown
dangers
a
sea
upon
which
none
but
the
bravest
mariners
dared
launch
their
ships
the
boy
had
often
looked
upon
these
scenes
of
beauty
and
mystery
but
his
heart
was
stirred
with
an
unwonted
feeling
of
awe
and
of
wonder
at
the
greatness
and
grandeur
of
the
world
as
it
thus
lay
around
him
tears
filled
his
eyes
as
he
turned
to
his
tutor
how
kind
it
was
of
the
being
who
made
this
pleasant
earth
to
set
our
own
sunny
ithaca
right
in
the
centre
of
it
and
to
cover
it
all
over
with
a
blue
dome
like
a
tent
but
tell
me
do
people
live
in
all
those
lands
that
we
see
i
know
that
there
are
men
dwelling
in
zacynthus
and
in
the
little
islands
of
the
eastern
sea
for
their
fishermen
often
come
to
ithaca
and
i
have
talked
with
them
and
i
have
heard
my
father
tell
of
his
wonderful
voyage
to
colchis
which
is
in
the
region
of
the
rising
sun
and
my
mother
often
speaks
of
her
old
home
in
parnassus
which
also
is
far
away
towards
the
dawn
is
it
true
that
there
are
men
women
and
children
living
in
lands
which
we
can
not
see
and
do
the
great
powers
above
us
care
for
them
as
for
the
good
people
of
ithaca
and
is
there
anywhere
another
king
so
great
as
my
father
laertes
or
another
kingdom
so
rich
and
happy
as
his
then
phemius
told
the
lad
all
about
the
land
of
the
hellenes
beyond
the
narrow
sea
and
in
the
sand
at
their
feet
he
drew
with
a
stick
a
map
of
all
the
countries
known
to
him
illustration
a
glimpse
of
the
world
the
map
which
phemius
drew
in
the
sand
we
can
not
see
half
of
the
world
from
this
spot
said
the
bard
neither
is
ithaca
the
centre
of
it
as
it
seems
to
you
i
will
draw
a
picture
of
it
here
in
the
sand
and
show
you
where
lies
every
land
and
every
sea
right
here
in
the
very
centre
said
he
heaping
up
a
pile
of
sand
into
the
shape
of
a
mountain
right
here
in
the
very
centre
of
the
world
is
mount
parnassus
the
home
of
the
muses
and
in
its
shadow
is
sacred
delphi
where
stands
apollo
s
temple
south
of
parnassus
is
the
bay
of
crissa
sometimes
called
the
corinthian
gulf
the
traveller
who
sails
westwardly
through
those
waters
will
have
on
his
right
hand
the
pleasant
hills
and
dales
of
ætolia
and
the
wooded
lands
of
calydon
while
on
his
left
will
rise
the
rugged
mountains
of
achaia
and
the
gentler
slopes
of
elis
here
to
the
south
of
elis
are
messene
and
sandy
pylos
where
godlike
nestor
and
his
aged
father
neleus
reign
here
to
the
east
is
arcadia
a
land
of
green
pastures
and
sweet
contentment
unwashed
by
any
sea
and
next
to
it
is
argolis
rich
in
horses
but
richest
of
all
in
noble
men
and
lacedæmon
in
laconia
famous
for
its
warriors
and
its
beautiful
women
far
to
the
north
of
parnassus
is
mount
olympus
the
home
of
zeus
and
the
place
where
the
gods
and
goddesses
hold
their
councils
then
phemius
as
he
was
often
wont
to
do
began
to
put
his
words
into
the
form
of
music
and
he
sang
a
song
of
the
world
as
he
supposed
it
to
be
he
sang
of
helios
the
sun
and
of
his
flaming
chariot
and
his
four
white
steeds
and
of
the
wonderful
journey
which
he
makes
every
day
above
the
earth
and
he
sang
of
the
snowy
mountains
of
caucasus
in
the
distant
east
and
of
the
gardens
of
the
hesperides
even
farther
to
the
westward
and
of
the
land
of
the
hyperboreans
which
lies
beyond
the
northern
mountains
and
of
the
sunny
climes
where
live
the
ethiopians
the
farthest
distant
of
all
earth
s
dwellers
then
he
sang
of
the
flowing
stream
of
ocean
which
encircles
all
lands
in
its
embrace
and
lastly
of
the
islands
of
the
blest
where
rhadamanthus
rules
and
where
there
is
neither
snow
nor
beating
rains
but
everlasting
spring
and
breezes
balmy
with
the
breath
of
life
o
phemius
cried
the
boy
as
the
bard
laid
aside
his
harp
i
never
knew
that
the
world
was
so
large
can
it
be
that
there
are
so
many
countries
and
so
many
strange
people
beneath
the
same
sky
yes
answered
phemius
the
world
is
very
broad
and
our
ithaca
is
but
one
of
the
smallest
of
a
thousand
lands
upon
which
helios
smiles
as
he
makes
his
daily
journey
through
the
skies
it
is
not
given
to
one
man
to
know
all
these
lands
and
happiest
is
he
whose
only
care
is
for
his
home
deeming
it
the
centre
around
which
the
world
is
built
if
only
the
half
of
what
you
have
told
me
be
true
said
the
boy
i
can
not
rest
until
i
have
seen
some
of
those
strange
lands
and
learned
more
about
the
wonderful
beings
which
live
in
them
i
can
not
bear
to
think
of
being
always
shut
up
within
the
narrow
bounds
of
little
ithaca
my
dear
boy
said
phemius
laughing
your
mind
has
been
greatly
changed
within
the
past
few
moments
when
we
came
here
a
little
while
ago
you
thought
that
neritus
was
the
grandest
mountain
in
the
world
and
that
ithaca
was
the
centre
round
which
the
earth
was
built
then
you
were
cheerful
and
contented
but
now
you
are
restless
and
unhappy
because
you
have
learned
of
possibilities
such
as
hitherto
you
had
not
dreamed
about
your
eyes
have
been
opened
to
see
and
to
know
the
world
as
it
is
and
you
are
no
longer
satisfied
with
that
which
ithaca
can
give
you
but
why
did
you
not
tell
me
these
things
before
asked
the
boy
it
was
your
mother
s
wish
answered
the
bard
that
you
should
not
know
them
until
do
you
remember
what
day
this
is
it
is
my
twelfth
birthday
and
i
remember
too
that
there
was
a
promise
made
to
my
grandfather
that
when
i
was
twelve
years
old
i
should
visit
him
in
his
strong
halls
on
mount
parnassus
i
mean
to
ask
my
mother
about
it
at
once
and
without
waiting
for
another
word
from
phemius
the
lad
ran
hurriedly
down
the
steep
pathway
and
was
soon
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
across
the
fields
he
hastened
and
through
the
vineyards
where
the
vines
trained
by
his
father
s
own
hand
were
already
hanging
heavy
with
grapes
he
found
his
mother
in
the

twisting
from

distaff

he
knelt
upon

said

boon
of

thing
in

and
now
that

since

grandfather

very
soon
i

odysseus
and
his
mother
the
queen
s
eyes
filled
with
tears
as
she
answered
you
shall
have
your
wish
my
son
the
promise
given
both
to
you
and
to
my
father
must
be
fulfilled
for
when
you
were
but
a
little
babe
autolycus
came
to
ithaca
and
one
evening
as
he
feasted
at
your
father
s
table
your
nurse
dame
eurycleia
brought
you
into
the
hall
and
put
you
into
his
arms
give
this
dear
babe
o
king
a
name
said
she
he
is
thy
daughter
s
son
the
heir
to
ithaca
s
rich
realm
and
we
hope
that
he
will
live
to
make
his
name
and
thine
then
autolycus
smiled
and
gently
dandled
you
upon
his
knees
my
daughter
and
my
daughter
s
lord
said
he
let
this
child
s
name
be
odysseus
for
he
shall
visit
many
lands
and
climes
and
wander
long
upon
the
tossing
sea
yet
wheresoever
the
fates
may
drive
him
his
heart
will
ever
turn
to
ithaca
his
home
call
him
by
the
name
which
i
have
given
and
when
his
twelfth
birthday
shall
have
passed
send
him
to
my
strong
halls
in
the
shadow
of
parnassus
where
his
mother
in
her
girlhood
dwelt
then
i
will
share
my
riches
with
him
and
send
him
back
to
ithaca
rejoicing
so
spake
my
father
great
autolycus
and
before
we
arose
from
that
feast
we
pledged
our
word
that
it
should
be
with
you
even
as
he
wished
and
your
name
odysseus
has
every
day
recalled
to
mind
that
feast
and
our
binding
words
oh
that
i
could
go
at
once
dear
mother
said
odysseus
kissing
her
tears
away
i
would
come
home
again
very
soon
i
would
stay
long
enough
to
have
the
blessing
of
my
kingly
grandfather
i
would
climb
parnassus
and
listen
to
the
sweet
music
of
the
muses
i
would
drink
one
draught
from
the
castalian
spring
of
which
you
have
so
often
told
me
i
would
ramble
one
day
among
the
groves
and
glens
that
perchance
i
might
catch
a
glimpse
of
apollo
or
of
his
huntress
sister
artemis
and
then
i
would
hasten
back
to
ithaca
and
would
never
leave
you
again
my
son
then
said
laertes
who
had
come
unheard
into
the
hall
and
had
listened
to
the
boy
s
earnest
words
my
son
you
shall
have
your
wish
for
i
know
that
the
fates
have
ordered
it
so
we
have
long
looked
forward
to
this
day
and
for
weeks
past
we
have
been
planning
for
your
journey
my
stanchest
ship
is
ready
to
carry
you
over
the
sea
and
needs
only
to
be
launched
into
the
bay
twelve
strong
oarsmen
are
sitting
now
upon
the
beach
waiting
for
orders
to
embark
with
the
bard
phemius
as
your
friend
and
guide
you
may
set
forth
on
your
voyage
to
parnassus
let
us
go
down
to
the
shore
at
once
and
offer
prayers
to
poseidon
ruler
of
the
sea
that
he
may
grant
you
favoring
winds
and
a
happy
voyage
odysseus
kissed
his
mother
again
and
turning
followed
his
father
from
the
hall
then
anticleia
rose
and
bade
the
maidens
hasten
to
make
ready
the
evening
meal
but
she
herself
went
weeping
to
her
own
chamber
there
to
choose
the
garments
which
her
son
should
take
with
him
upon
his
journey
warm
robes
of
wool
and
a
broidered
tunic
which
she
with
her
own
hands
had
spun
and
woven
she
folded
and
laid
with
care
in
a
little
wooden
chest
and
with
them
she
placed
many
a
little
comfort
fruit
and
sweetmeats
such
as
she
rightly
deemed
would
please
the
lad
then
when
she
had
closed
the
lid
she
threw
a
strong
cord
around
the
chest
and
tied
it
firmly
down
this
done
she
raised
her
eyes
towards
heaven
and
lifting
up
her
hands
she
prayed
to
pallas
athené
o
queen
of
the
air
and
sky
hearken
to
my
prayer
and
help
me
lay
aside
the
doubting
fears
which
creep
into
my
mind
and
cause
these
tears
to
flow
for
now
my
boy
unused
to
hardships
and
knowing
nothing
of
the
world
is
to
be
sent
forth
on
a
long
and
dangerous
voyage
i
tremble
lest
evil
overtake
him
but
more
i
fear
that
with
the
lawless
men
of
my
father
s
household
he
shall
forget
his
mother
s
teachings
and
stray
from
the
path
of
duty
do
thou
o
queen
go
with
him
as
his
guide
and
guard
keep
him
from
harm
and
bring
him
safe
again
to
ithaca
and
his
loving
mother
s
arms
meanwhile
laertes
and
the
men
of
ithaca
stood
upon
the
beach
and
offered
up
two
choice
oxen
to
poseidon
ruler
of
the
sea
and
they
prayed
him
that
he
would
vouchsafe
favoring
winds
and
quiet
waters
and
a
safe
journey
to
the
bold
voyagers
who
would
launch
their
ship
upon
the
deep
and
when
the
sun
began
to
sink
low
down
in
the
west
some
sought
their
homes
and
others
went
up
to
the
king
s
white
palace
to
tarry
until
after
the
evening
meal
cheerful
was
the
feast
and
as
the
merry
jest
went
round
no
one
seemed
more
free
from
care
than
king
laertes
and
when
all
had
eaten
of
the
food
and
had
tasted
of
the
red
wine
made
from
the
king
s
own
vintage
the
bard
phemius
arose
and
tuned
his
harp
and
sang
many
sweet
and
wonderful
songs
he
sang
of
the
beginning
of
things
of
the
earth
the
mother
of
created
beings
of
the
sky
and
the
sea
and
the
mountains
of
the
mighty
race
of
titans
giants
who
once
ruled
the
earth
of
great
atlas
who
holds
the
upon
his
shoulders
of
cronos
and
old
oceanus
of
the
war
which
for
ten
years
raged
on
mount
olympus
until
zeus
hurled
his
unfeeling
father
cronos
from
the
throne
and
seized
the
sceptre
for
himself
when
phemius
ended
his
singing
the
guests
withdrew
from
the
hall
and
each
went
silently
to
his
own
home
and
odysseus
having
kissed
his
dear
father
and
mother
went
thoughtfully
to
his
high
up
above
the
great
hall
with
him
went
his
nurse
dame
eurycleia
carrying
the
torches
she
had
been
a
princess
once
but
hard
fate
and
cruel
war
had
overthrown
her
father
s
kingdom
and
had
sent
her
forth
a
captive
and
a
slave
laertes
had
bought
her
of
her
captors
for
a
hundred
oxen
and
had
given
her
a
place
of
honor
in
his
household
next
to
anticleia
she
loved
odysseus
as
she
would
love
her
own
dear
child
for
since
his
birth
she
had
nursed
and
cared
for
him
she
now
as
was
her
wont
lighted
him
to
his
chamber
she
laid
back
the
soft
coverings
of
his
bed
she
smoothed
the
fleeces
and
hung
his
tunic
within
easy
reach
then
with
kind
words
of
farewell
for
the
night
she
quietly
withdrew
and
closed
the
door
and
pulled
the
thong
outside
which
turned
the
fastening
latch
odysseus
wrapped
himself
among
the
fleeces
of
his
bed
and
soon
was
lost
in
slumber

of

volume
ii
voyage
on
the
sea
early
the
next
morning
while
yet
the
dawn
was
waiting
for
the
sun
odysseus
arose
and
hastened
to
make
ready
for
his
journey
the
little
galley
which
was
to
carry
him
across
the
sea
had
been
already
launched
and
was
floating
close
to
the
shore
and
the
oarsmen
stood
upon
the
beach
impatient
to
begin
the
voyage
the
and
the
little
chest
in
which
the
lad
s
wardrobe
lay
were
brought
on
board
and
placed
beneath
the
rowers
benches
the
old
men
of
ithaca
and
the
boys
and
the
maidens
hurried
down
to
the
shore
that
they
might
bid
the
voyagers
odysseus
when
all
was
ready
spoke
a
few
last
kind
words
to
his
mother
and
sage
laertes
and
then
with
a
swelling
heart
went
up
the
vessel
s
side
and
sat
down
in
the
stern
and
phemius
the
bard
holding
his
harp
followed
him
and
took
his
place
in
the
prow
then
the
sailors
loosed
the
moorings
and
went
on
board
and
sitting
on
the
rowers
benches
wielded
the
long
oars
and
the
little
vessel
driven
by
their
strokes
turned
slowly
about
and
then
glided
smoothly
across
the
bay
and
the
eyes
of
all
on
shore
were
wet
with
tears
as
they
prayed
the
rulers
of
the
air
and
the
sea
that
the
voyagers
might
reach
their
port
in
safety
and
in
due
time
come
back
unharmed
to
ithaca
no
sooner
had
the
vessel
reached
the
open
sea
than
pallas
athené
sent
after
it
a
gentle
west
wind
to
urge
it
on
its
way
as
the
soft
breeze
laden
with
the
perfumes
of
blossoming
orchards
stirred
the
water
into
rippling
waves
phemius
bade
the
rowers
lay
aside
their
oars
and
hoist
the
sail
they
heeded
his
behest
and
lifting
high
the
slender
mast
they
bound
it
in
its
place
then
they
stretched
aloft
the
broad
white
sail
and
the
west
wind
caught
and
filled
it
and
drove
the
little
bark
cheerily
over
the
waves
and
the
grateful
crew
sat
down
upon
the
benches
and
with
odysseus
and
phemius
the
bard
they
joined
in
offering
heartfelt
thanks
to
pallas
athené
who
had
so
kindly
prospered
them
and
by
and
by
phemius
played
soft
melodies
on
his
harp
such
as
the
liked
to
hear
and
all
that
summer
day
the
breezes
whispered
in
the
rigging
and
the
white
waves
danced
in
the
vessel
s
wake
and
the
voyagers
sped
happily
on
their
way
in
the
afternoon
when
they
had
begun
somewhat
to
tire
of
the
voyage
phemius
asked
odysseus
what
they
should
do
to
lighten
the
passing
hours
tell
us
some
story
of
the
olden
time
said
odysseus
and
the
bard
who
was
never
better
pleased
than
when
recounting
some
wonderful
tale
sat
down
in
the
midships
where
the
oarsmen
could
readily
hear
him
and
told
the
strange
story
of
phaethon
the
rash
son
of
helios
hyperion
among
the
immortals
who
give
good
gifts
to
men
there
is
no
one
more
kind
than
helios
the
bestower
of
light
and
heat
every
morning
when
the
dawn
with
her
rosy
fingers
illumes
the
eastern
sky
good
helios
rises
from
his
golden
couch
and
from
their
pasture
calls
his
steeds
by
name
he
calls
them
eos
æthon
bronté
astrape
each
hears
his
master
s
voice
and
comes
obedient
then
about
their
bright
manes
and
his
own
yellow
locks
he
twines
wreaths
of
flowers
amaranths
and
daffodils
and
asphodels
from
the
heavenly
gardens
and
the
hours
come
and
harness
the
steeds
to
the
burning
and
put
the
reins
into
helios
hyperion
s
hands
he
mounts
to
his
place
he
speaks
and
the
winged
team
soars
upward
into
the
morning
air
and
all
earth
s
children
awake
and
give
thanks
to
the
ruler
of
the
sun
for
the
new
day
which
smiles
down
upon
them
hour
after
hour
with
steady
hand
helios
guides
his
steeds
and
the
flaming
car
is
borne
along
the
through
the
sky
and
when
the
day
s
work
is
done
and
sable
night
comes
creeping
over
the
earth
the
steeds
the
car
and
the
driver
sink
softly
down
to
the
western
ocean
s
stream
where
a
golden
vessel
waits
to
bear
them
back
again
swiftly
and
unseen
to
the
dwelling
of
the
sun
in
the
east
there
under
the
helios
greets
his
mother
and
his
wife
and
his
dear
children
and
there
he
rests
until
the
dawn
again
leaves
old
ocean
s
bed
and
blushing
comes
to
bid
him
journey
forth
anew
one
son
had
helios
phaethon
the
gleaming
and
among
the
children
of
men
there
was
no
one
more
fair
and
the
great
heart
of
helios
beat
with
love
for
his
and
he
gave
him
rich
gifts
and
kept
nothing
from
him
and
phaethon
as
he
grew
up
became
as
proud
as
he
was
fair
and
wherever
he
went
he
boasted
of
his
kinship
to
the
sun
and
men
when
they
looked
upon
his
matchless
form
and
his
radiant
features
believed
his
words
and
honored
him
as
the
heir
of
helios
hyperion
but
one
epaphos
a
son
of
zeus
sneered
thou
a
child
of
helios
he
said
what
folly
thou
canst
show
nothing
wherewith
to
prove
thy
kinship
save
thy
fair
face
and
thy
yellow
hair
and
there
are
many
maidens
in
hellas
who
have
those
and
are
as
beautiful
as
thou
manly
grace
and
handsome
features
are
indeed
the
gifts
of
the
gods
but
it
is
by
godlike
deeds
alone
that
one
can
prove
his
kinship
to
the
immortals
while
helios
hyperion
thy
father
as
thou
wouldst
have
it
guides
his
chariot
above
the
clouds
and
showers
blessings
upon
the
earth
what
dost
thou
do
what
indeed
but
dally
with
thy
yellow
locks
and
gaze
upon
thy
costly
clothing
while
all
the
time
thy
feet
are
in
the
dust
and
the
mire
of
the
earth
holds
them
fast
if
thou
hast
kinship
with
the
gods
prove
it
by
doing
the
deeds
of
the
gods
if
thou
art
helios
hyperion
s
son
guide
for
one
day
his
chariot
through
the
thus
spoke
epaphos
and
the
mind
of
phaethon
was
filled
with
lofty
dreams
and
turning
away
from
the
taunting
tempter
he
hastened
to
his
father
s
house
helios
with
his
steeds
and
car
had
just
finished
the
course
of
another
day
and
with
words
of
warmest
love
he
greeted
his
son
dear
phaethon
he
said
what
errand
brings
thee
hither
at
this
hour
when
the
sons
of
men
find
rest
in
slumber
is
there
any
good
gift
that
thou
wouldst
have
say
what
it
is
and
it
shall
be
and
phaethon
wept
and
he
said
father
there
are
those
who
say
that
i
am
not
thy
son
give
me
i
pray
thee
a
token
whereby
i
can
prove
my
kinship
to
and
helios
answered
mine
it
is
to
labor
every
day
and
short
is
the
rest
i
have
that
so
earth
s
children
may
have
light
and
life
yet
tell
me
what
token
thou
cravest
and
i
swear
that
i
will
give
it
father
helios
said
the
youth
this
is
the
token
that
i
ask
let
me
sit
in
thy
place
and
drive
thy
steeds
along
the
pathway
of
the
then
was
the
heart
of
helios
full
sad
and
he
said
to
phaethon
my
child
thou
knowest
not
what
thou
askest
thou
art
not
like
the
gods
and
there
lives
no
man
who
can
drive
my
steeds
or
guide
the
through
the
skies
i
pray
thee
ask
some
other
but
phaethon
would
not
i
will
have
this
boon
or
none
i
will
drive
thy
steeds
and
thereby
make
proof
of
my
then
helios
pleaded
long
with
his
son
that
he
would
not
aspire
to
deeds
too
great
for
weak
man
to
undertake
but
wayward
phaethon
would
not
hear
and
when
the
dawn
peeped
forth
and
the
hours
harnessed
the
steeds
to
the
car
his
father
sadly
gave
the
reins
into
his
hands
my
love
for
thee
cries
out
refrain
refrain
yet
for
my
oath
s
sake
i
grant
thy
and
he
hid
his
face
and
wept
and
phaethon
leaped
into
the
car
and
lashed
the
steeds
with
his
whip
up
they
sprang
and
swift
as
a
storm
cloud
they
sped
high
into
the
blue
vault
of
heaven
for
well
did
they
know
that
an
unskilled
hand
held
the
reins
and
proudly
they
scorned
his
control
the
haughty
heart
of
phaethon
sank
within
him
and
all
his
courage
failed
and
the
long
reins
dropped
from
his
nerveless
grasp
glorious
father
he
cried
in
agony
thy
words
were
true
would
that
i
had
hearkened
to
thy
warning
and
obeyed
and
the
mad
with
their
freedom
wildly
careered
in
and
then
plunged
downward
towards
the
earth
close
to
the
peopled
plains
they
dashed
and
soared
dragging
the
car
behind
them
the
parched
earth
smoked
the
rivers
turned
to
vaporous
clouds
the
trees
shook
off
their
scorched
leaves
and
died
and
men
and
beasts
hid
in
the
caves
and
rocky
clefts
and
there
perished
with
thirst
and
the
unbearable
heat
o
father
zeus
prayed
mother
earth
send
help
to
thy
children
or
they
perish
through
this
man
s
presumptuous
folly
then
the
thunderer
from
his
high
seat
hurled
his
dread
bolts
and
unhappy
phaethon
fell
headlong
from
the
car
and
the
steeds
affrighted
but
obedient
hastened
back
to
the
pastures
of
helios
on
the
shores
of
old
ocean
s
stream
phaethon
fell
into
the
river
which
men
call
eridanos
and
his
sisters
wept
for
him
and
as
they
stood
upon
the
banks
and
bewailed
his
unhappy
fate
father
zeus
in
pity
changed
them
into
tall
green
poplars
and
their
tears
falling
into
the
river
were
hardened
into
precious
yellow
amber
but
the
daughters
of
hesperus
through
whose
country
this
river
flows
built
for
the
fair
hero
a
marble
tomb
close
by
the
sounding
sea
and
they
sang
a
song
about
phaethon
and
said
that
although
he
had
been
hurled
to
the
earth
by
the
thunderbolts
of
angry
zeus
yet
he
died
not
without
honor
for
he
had
his
heart
set
on
the
doing
of
great
deeds
as
phemius
ended
his
story
odysseus
who
had
been
too
intent
upon
listening
to
look
around
him
raised
his
eyes
and
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
for
he
saw
that
they
had
left
the
open
sea
behind
them
and
were
entering
the
long
and
narrow
gulf
between
achaia
and
the
ætolian
land
the
oarsmen
who
too
had
been
earnest
listeners
sprang
quickly
to
their
places
and
hastened
to
ply
their
long
oars
for
now
the
breeze
had
begun
to
slacken
and
the
sail
hung
limp
and
useless
upon
the
ship
s
mast
keeping
close
to
the
northern
shore
they
rounded
capes
and
headlands
and
skirted
the
mouths
of
deep
inlets
where
phemius
said
strange
monsters
often
lurked
in
wait
for
unwary
or
belated
seafarers
but
they
passed
all
these
places
safely
and
saw
no
living
creature
save
some
flocks
of
flying
among
the
cliffs
and
one
lone
frightened
fisherman
who
left
his
net
upon
the
sands
and
ran
to
hide
himself
in
the
thickets
of
underbrush
which
skirted
the
beach
late
in
the
day
they
came
to
the
mouth
of
a
little
harbor
which
like
one
in
ithaca
was
a
favored
haunt
of
old
phorcys
the
elder
of
the
sea
here
the
captain
of
the
oarsmen
said
they
must
tarry
for
the
night
for
the
sun
was
already
sinking
in
the
west
and
after
nightfall
no
ship
could
be
guided
with
safety
along
these
shores
a
narrow
strait
between
high
cliffs
led
into
the
little
haven
which
was
so
sheltered
from
the
winds
that
vessels
could
ride
there
without
their
hawsers
even
though
fierce
storms
might
rage
upon
the
sea
outside
through
this
strait
the
ship
was
guided
urged
by
the
strong
arms
of
the
rowers
and
so
swiftly
did
it
glide
across
the
harbor
that
it
was
driven
upon
the
shelving
beach
at
the
farther
side
and
stopped
not
until
it
lay
full
half
its
length
high
upon
the
warm
dry
sand
then
the
crew
lifted
out
their
store
of
food
and
their
vessels
for
cooking
and
while
some
took
their
bows
and
went
in
search
of
game
others
kindled
a
fire
and
hastened
to
make
ready
the
evening
meal
odysseus
and
his
tutor
when
they
had
climbed
out
of
the
ship
sauntered
along
the
beach
intent
to
know
what
kind
of
place
it
was
to
which
fortune
had
thus
brought
them
they
found
that
it
was
in
all
things
a
pattern
and
counterpart
of
the
little
bay
of
phorcys
in
their
own
ithaca
see
the
description
of
this
bay
in
the
odyssey
book
xiii
near
the
head
of
the
harbor
grew
an
olive
tree
beneath
whose
spreading
branches
there
was
a
cave
in
which
men
said
the
naiads
sometimes
dwelt
in
this
cave
were
great
bowls
and
jars
and
pitchers
all
of
stone
and
in
the
clefts
of
the
rock
the
wild
bees
had
built
their
comb
and
filled
it
with
yellow
honey
in
this
cave
too
were
long
looms
on
which
from
their
spindles
wrought
of
stone
the
naiads
were
thought
to
weave
their
purple
robes
close
by
the
looms
a
torrent
of
sweet
water
gushed
from
the
rock
and
flowed
in
crystal
streams
down
into
the
bay
two
doorways
opened
into
the
cave
one
from
the
north
through
which
mortal
man
might
enter
and
one
from
the
south
kept
as
the
pathway
of
phorcys
and
the
naiads
but
odysseus
and
his
tutor
saw
no
signs
of
any
of
these
beings
it
seemed
as
if
the
place
had
not
been
visited
for
many
a
month
after
the
voyagers
had
partaken
of
their
meal
they
sat
for
a
long
time
around
the
blazing
fire
upon
the
beach
and
each
told
some
marvellous
story
of
the
sea
for
their
thoughts
were
all
upon
the
wonders
of
the
deep
we
should
not
speak
of
poseidon
the
king
of
waters
said
the
captain
save
with
fear
upon
our
lips
and
reverence
in
our
hearts
for
he
it
is
who
rules
the
sea
as
his
brother
zeus
controls
the
land
and
no
one
dares
to
dispute
his
right
once
when
sailing
on
the
ægæan
sea
i
looked
down
into
the
depths
and
saw
his
lordly
palace
a
glittering
golden
mansion
built
on
the
rocks
at
the
bottom
of
the
mere
quickly
did
we
spread
our
sails
aloft
and
the
friendly
breezes
and
our
own
strong
arms
hurried
us
safely
away
from
that
wonderful
but
dangerous
station
in
that
palace
of
the
deep
poseidon
eats
and
drinks
and
makes
merry
with
his
friends
the
dwellers
in
the
sea
and
there
he
feeds
and
trains
his
swift
horses
horses
with
hoofs
of
bronze
and
flowing
golden
manes
and
when
he
harnesses
these
steeds
to
his
chariot
and
wields
above
them
his
lash
of
gold
you
should
see
as
i
have
seen
how
he
rides
in
terrible
majesty
above
the
waves
and
the
creatures
of
the
sea
pilot
him
on
his
way
and
gambol
on
either
side
of
the
car
and
follow
dancing
in
his
wake
but
when
he
smites
the
waters
with
the
trident
which
he
always
carries
in
his
hand
the
waves
roll
mountain
high
the
lightnings
flash
and
the
thunders
peal
and
the
earth
is
shaken
to
its
very
core
then
it
is
that
man
bewails
his
own
weakness
and
prays
to
the
powers
above
for
help
and
succor
i
have
never
seen
the
palace
of
poseidon
said
the
helmsman
speaking
slowly
but
once
when
sailing
to
crete
our
ship
was
overtaken
by
a
storm
and
for
ten
days
we
were
buffeted
by
winds
and
waves
and
driven
into
unknown
seas
after
this
we
vainly
tried
to
find
again
our
reckonings
but
we
knew
not
which
way
to
turn
our
vessel
s
prow
then
when
the
storm
had
ended
we
saw
upon
a
sandy
islet
great
troops
of
seals
and
couched
upon
the
beach
and
basking
in
the
warm
rays
of
the
sun
let
us
cast
anchor
and
wait
here
said
our
captain
for
surely
proteus
the
old
man
of
the
sea
who
keeps
poseidon
s
herds
will
come
erewhile
to
look
after
these
and
he
was
right
for
at
noonday
the
herdsman
of
the
sea
came
up
out
of
the
brine
and
went
among
his
and
counted
them
and
called
each
one
by
name
when
he
was
sure
that
not
even
one
was
missing
he
lay
down
among
them
upon
the
sand
then
we
landed
quickly
from
our
vessel
and
rushed
silently
upon
him
and
seized
him
with
our
hands
the
old
master
of
magic
tried
hard
to
escape
from
our
clutches
and
did
not
forget
his
cunning
first
he
took
the
form
of
a
lion
fierce
and
terrible
but
when
this
did
not
affright
us
he
turned
into
a
scaly
serpent
then
into
a
leopard
spotted
and
beautiful
then
into
a
wild
boar
with
gnashing
tusks
and
foaming
mouth
seeing
that
by
none
of
these
forms
he
could
make
us
loosen
our
grasp
upon
him
he
took
the
shape
of
running
water
as
if
to
glide
through
our
fingers
then
he
became
a
tall
tree
full
of
leaves
and
blossoms
and
lastly
he
became
himself
again
and
he
pleaded
with
us
for
his
freedom
and
promised
to
tell
us
any
thing
that
we
desired
if
we
would
only
let
him
go
tell
us
which
way
we
shall
sail
and
how
far
we
shall
go
that
we
may
surely
reach
the
fair
harbor
of
crete
said
our
captain
sail
with
the
wind
two
days
said
the
elder
of
the
sea
and
on
the
third
morning
ye
shall
behold
the
hills
of
crete
and
the
pleasant
port
which
you
then
we
loosened
our
hold
upon
him
and
old
proteus
plunged
into
the
briny
deep
and
we
betook
ourselves
to
our
ship
and
sailed
away
before
the
wind
and
on
the
third
day
as
he
had
told
us
we
sighted
the
fair
harbor
of
crete
as
the
helmsman
ended
his
story
his
listeners
smiled
for
he
had
told
them
nothing
but
an
old
tale
which
every
seaman
had
learned
in
his
youth
the
story
of
proteus
symbol
of
the
forms
of
matter
just
then
odysseus
heard
a
low
plaintive
murmur
seeming
as
if
uttered
by
some
lost
wanderer
away
out
upon
the
sea
what
is
that
he
asked
turning
towards
phemius
it
is
glaucus
the
soothsayer
of
the
sea
lamenting
that
he
is
mortal
answered
the
bard
long
time
ago
glaucus
was
a
poor
fisherman
who
cast
his
nets
into
these
very
waters
and
built
his
hut
upon
the
ætolian
shore
not
very
far
from
the
place
where
we
now
sit
before
his
hut
there
was
a
green
grassy
spot
where
he
often
sat
to
dress
the
fish
which
he
caught
one
day
he
carried
a
basketful
of
fish
to
that
spot
and
turned
them
out
upon
the
ground
wonderful
to
behold
each
fish
took
a
blade
of
grass
in
its
mouth
and
forthwith
jumped
into
the
sea
the
next
day
he
found
a
hare
in
the
woods
and
gave
chase
to
it
the
frightened
creature
ran
straight
to
the
grassy
plat
before
his
hut
seized
a
green
spear
of
grass
between
its
lips
and
dashed
into
the
sea
strange
what
kind
of
grass
that
is
cried
glaucus
then
he
pulled
up
a
blade
and
tasted
it
quick
as
thought
he
also
jumped
into
the
sea
and
there
he
wanders
evermore
among
the
seaweeds
and
the
sand
and
the
pebbles
and
the
sunken
rocks
and
although
he
has
the
gift
of
soothsaying
and
can
tell
what
things
are
in
store
for
mortal
men
he
mourns
and
laments
because
he
can
not
die
then
phemius
seeing
that
odysseus
grew
tired
of
his
story
took
up
his
harp
and
touched
its
strings
and
sang
a
song
about
old
phorcys
the
son
of
the
sea
and
mother
earth
and
about
his
strange
daughters
who
dwell
in
regions
far
remote
from
the
homes
of
men
he
touched
his
harp
lightly
and
sang
a
sweet
lullaby
a
song
about
the
sirens
the
fairest
of
all
the
daughters
of
old
phorcys
these
have
their
home
in
an
enchanted
island
in
the
midst
of
the
western
sea
and
they
sit
in
a
green
meadow
by
the
shore
and
they
sing
evermore
of
empty
pleasures
and
of
phantoms
of
delight
and
of
vain
expectations
and
woe
is
the
wayfaring
man
who
hearkens
to
them
for
by
their
bewitching
tones
they
lure
him
to
his
death
and
never
again
shall
he
see
his
dear
wife
or
his
babes
who
wait
long
and
vainly
for
his
stop
thine
ears
o
voyager
on
the
sea
and
listen
not
to
the
songs
of
the
sirens
sing
they
ever
so
sweetly
for
the
white
flowers
which
dot
the
meadow
around
them
are
not
daisies
but
the
bleached
bones
of
their
victims
then
phemius
smote
the
chords
of
his
harp
and
played
a
melody
so
weird
and
wild
that
odysseus
sprang
to
his
feet
and
glanced
quickly
around
him
as
if
he
thought
to
see
some
grim
and
horrid
shape
threatening
him
from
among
the
gathering
shadows
and
this
time
the
bard
sang
a
strange
tumultuous
song
concerning
other
daughters
of
old
phorcys
the
three
gray
sisters
with
shape
of
swan
who
have
but
one
tooth
for
all
and
one
common
eye
and
who
sit
forever
on
a
barren
rock
near
the
farthest
shore
of
ocean
s
stream
upon
them
the
sun
doth
never
cast
a
beam
and
the
moon
doth
never
look
but
horrible
and
alone
they
sit
clothed
in
their
yellow
robes
and
chatter
threats
and
meaningless
complaints
to
the
waves
which
dash
against
their
rock
not
far
away
from
these
monsters
once
sat
the
three
gorgons
daughters
also
of
old
phorcys
these
were
clothed
with
wings
and
horror
sat
upon
their
faces
they
had
ringlets
of
snakes
for
hair
and
their
teeth
were
like
the
tusks
of
swine
and
their
hands
were
talons
of
brass
and
no
mortal
could
ever
gaze
upon
them
and
breathe
again
but
there
came
one
time
a
young
hero
to
those
regions
perseus
the
godlike
and
he
snatched
the
eye
of
the
three
gray
sisters
and
flung
it
far
into
the
depths
of
lake
tritonis
and
he
slew
medusa
the
most
fearful
of
the
gorgons
and
carried
the
head
of
the
terror
back
to
hellas
with
him
as
a
trophy
the
bard
chose
next
a
gentler
theme
and
as
he
touched
his
harp
the
listeners
fancied
that
they
heard
the
soft
sighing
of
the
south
wind
stirring
lazily
the
leaves
and
blossoms
they
heard
the
plashing
of
fountains
and
the
rippling
of
and
the
songs
of
little
birds
and
their
minds
were
carried
away
in
memory
to
pleasant
gardens
in
a
summer
land
and
phemius
sang
of
the
hesperides
or
the
maidens
of
the
west
who
also
men
say
are
the
daughters
of
phorcys
the
ancient
the
hesperian
land
in
which
they
dwell
is
a
country
of
delight
where
the
trees
are
laden
with
golden
fruit
and
every
day
is
a
sweet
dream
of
joy
and
peace
and
the
hesperides
sing
and
dance
in
the
sunlight
always
and
their
only
task
is
to
guard
the
golden
apples
which
grow
there
and
which
mother
earth
gave
to
here
the
queen
upon
her
wedding
day
here
phemius
paused
odysseus
lulled
by
the
soft
music
and
overcome
by
weariness
had
lain
down
upon
the
sand
and
fallen
asleep
at
a
sign
from
the
bard
the
seamen
lifted
him
gently
into
the
ship
and
covering
him
with
warm
skins
they
left
him
to
slumber
through
the
night
iii
centre
of
the
earth
the
next
morning
before
the
sun
had
risen
the
voyagers
launched
their
ship
again
and
sailed
out
of
the
little
harbor
into
the
long
bay
of
crissa
and
pallas
athené
sent
the
west
wind
early
to
help
them
forward
on
their
way
and
they
spread
their
sail
and
instead
of
longer
hugging
the
shore
they
ventured
boldly
out
into
the
middle
of
the
bay
all
day
long
the
ship
held
on
its
course
skimming
swiftly
through
the
waves
like
a
great
bird
and
those
on
board
beguiled
the
hours
with
song
and
story
as
on
the
day
before
but
when
the
evening
came
they
were
far
from
land
and
the
captain
said
that
as
the
water
was
deep
and
he
knew
the
sea
quite
well
they
would
not
put
into
port
but
would
sail
straight
on
all
night
and
so
when
the
sun
had
gone
down
and
the
moon
had
risen
flooding
earth
and
sea
with
her
pure
soft
light
odysseus
wrapped
his
warm
cloak
about
him
and
lay
down
again
to
rest
upon
his
bed
of
skins
between
the
rowers
benches
but
the
helmsman
stood
at
his
place
and
guided
the
vessel
over
the
shadowy
waves
and
through
the
watches
of
the
night
the
west
wind
filled
the
sails
and
the
dark
keel
of
the
little
bark
ploughed
the
waters
and
pallas
athené
blessed
the
voyage
when
at
length
the
third
morning
came
and
helios
arose
at
summons
of
the
dawn
odysseus
awoke
to
his
great
surprise
he
heard
no
longer
the
rippling
of
the
waves
upon
the
vessel
s
sides
nor
the
flapping
of
the
sail
in
the
wind
nor
yet
the
rhythmic
dipping
of
the
oars
into
the
sea
he
listened
and
the
sound
of
merry
laughter
came
to
his
ears
and
he
heard
the
twittering
of
many
birds
and
the
bleating
of
little
lambs
he
rubbed
his
eyes
and
sat
up
and
looked
about
him
the
ship
was
no
longer
floating
on
the
water
but
had
been
drawn
high
up
on
a
sandy
beach
and
the
crew
were
sitting
beneath
an
olive
tree
at
no
great
distance
from
the
shore
listening
to
the
melodies
with
which
a
shepherd
welcomed
on
his
flute
the
coming
of
another
day
odysseus
arose
quickly
and
leaped
out
upon
the
beach
then
it
was
that
a
scene
of
beauty
and
quiet
grandeur
met
his
gaze
a
scene
the
like
of
which
had
never
entered
his
thoughts
nor
visited
his
dreams
he
saw
a
few
miles
to
the
northward
a
group
of
high
mountains
whose
summits
towered
above
the
clouds
and
highest
among
them
all
were
twin
peaks
whose
tops
seemed
but
little
lower
than
the
skies
themselves
and
as
the
light
of
the
newly
risen
sun
gilded
the
gray
crags
and
painted
the
rocky
slopes
and
shone
bright
among
the
wooded
uplands
the
whole
scene
appeared
like
a
living
picture
glorious
with
purple
and
gold
and
azure
and
brilliant
with
sparkling
gems
is
it
not
truly
a
fitting
place
for
the
home
of
beauty
and
music
the
dwelling
of
apollo
and
the
favored
haunt
of
the
muses
asked
phemius
drawing
near
and
observing
the
boy
s
wondering
delight
indeed
it
is
said
odysseus
afraid
to
turn
his
eyes
away
lest
the
enchanting
vision
should
vanish
like
a
dream
but
is
that
mountain
really
parnassus
and
is
our
journey
so
nearly
at
an
end
yes
answered
the
bard
that
peak
which
towers
highest
toward
the
sky
is
great
parnassus
the
centre
of
the
earth
and
in
the
rocky
cleft
which
you
can
barely
see
between
the
twin
mountains
stands
sacred
delphi
and
the
favored
temple
of
apollo
lower
down
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
is
the
dwelling
of
old
autolycus
your
mother
s
father
although
the
mountain
seems
so
near
it
is
yet
a
long
and
toilsome
journey
thither
a
journey
which
we
must
make
on
foot
and
by
pathways
none
the
safest
come
let
us
join
the
sailors
under
the
olive
tree
and
when
we
have
breakfasted
we
will
begin
our
journey
to
parnassus
the
strange
shepherd
had
killed
the
fattest
sheep
of
his
flock
and
had
roasted
the
choicest
parts
upon
a
bed
of
burning
coals
and
when
odysseus
and
his
tutor
came
to
the
olive
tree
they
found
a
breakfast
fit
indeed
for
kings
set
out
ready
before
them
welcome
noble
strangers
said
the
shepherd
welcome
to
the
land
most
loved
of
the
muses
i
give
you
of
the
best
of
all
that
i
have
and
i
am
ready
to
serve
you
and
do
your
bidding
phemius
thanked
the
shepherd
for
his
kindness
and
while
they
sat
upon
the
grass
and
ate
of
the
pleasant
food
which
had
been
provided
he
asked
the
simple
swain
many
questions
about
parnassus
i
have
heard
that
parnassus
is
the
hub
around
which
the
great
is
built
is
it
really
true
a
long
long
time
ago
answered
the
man
there
were
neither
any
shepherds
nor
sheep
in
hellas
and
not
even
the
gods
knew
where
the
centre
of
the
earth
had
been
put
some
said
that
it
was
at
mount
olympus
where
zeus
sits
in
his
great
house
with
all
the
deathless
ones
around
him
others
said
that
it
was
in
achaia
and
others
still
in
arcadia
now
the
land
of
shepherds
and
some
who
it
seems
to
me
had
lost
their
wits
said
that
it
was
not
in
hellas
at
all
but
in
a
strange
land
beyond
the
western
sea
in
order
that
he
might
know
the
truth
great
zeus
one
day
took
two
eagles
both
of
the
same
strength
and
swiftness
and
said
these
birds
shall
tell
us
what
even
the
gods
do
not
then
he
carried
one
of
the
eagles
to
the
far
east
where
the
dawn
rises
out
of
ocean
s
bed
and
he
carried
the
other
to
the
far
west
where
helios
and
his
sink
into
the
waves
and
he
clapped
his
hands
together
and
the
thunder
rolled
and
the
swift
birds
flew
at
the
same
moment
to
meet
each
other
and
right
above
the
spot
where
delphi
stands
they
came
together
beak
to
beak
and
both
fell
dead
to
the
ground
behold
there
is
the
centre
of
the
earth
said
zeus
and
all
the
gods
agreed
that
he
was
right
do
you
know
the
best
and
shortest
road
to
delphi
asked
phemius
no
one
knows
it
better
than
i
was
the
answer
when
i
was
a
boy
i
fed
my
sheep
at
the
foot
of
parnassus
and
my
father
and
grandfather
lived
there
long
before
the
town
of
delphi
was
built
or
there
was
any
temple
there
for
apollo
shall
i
tell
you
how
men
came
to
build
a
temple
at
that
spot
yes
tell
us
said
odysseus
i
am
anxious
to
know
all
about
it
you
must
not
repeat
my
story
to
the
priests
at
delphi
said
the
shepherd
speaking
now
in
a
lower
tone
for
they
have
quite
a
different
way
of
telling
it
and
they
would
say
that
i
have
spoken
lightly
of
sacred
things
there
was
a
time
when
only
shepherds
lived
on
the
mountain
slopes
and
there
were
neither
priests
nor
warriors
nor
robbers
in
all
this
land
my
grandfather
was
one
of
those
happy
shepherds
and
he
often
pastured
his
flocks
on
the
broad
terrace
where
the
town
of
delphi
now
stands
and
where
the
two
eagles
which
i
have
told
you
about
fell
to
the
ground
one
day
a
strange
thing
happened
to
him
a
goat
which
was
nibbling
the
grass
from
the
sides
of
a
little
crevice
in
the
rock
fell
into
a
fit
and
lay
bleating
and
helpless
upon
the
ground
my
grandfather
ran
to
help
the
beast
but
as
he
stooped
down
he
too
fell
into
a
fit
and
he
saw
strange
visions
and
spoke
prophetic
words
some
other
shepherds
who
were
passing
by
saw
his
plight
and
lifted
him
up
and
as
soon
as
he
breathed
the
fresh
air
he
was
himself
again
often
after
this
the
same
thing
happened
to
my
grandfather
s
goats
and
when
he
had
looked
carefully
into
the
matter
he
found
that
a
warm
stifling
vapor
issued
at
times
from
the
crevice
and
that
it
was
the
breathing
of
this
vapor
which
had
caused
his
goats
and
even
himself
to
lose
their
senses
then
other
men
came
and
they
learned
that
by
sitting
close
to
the
crevice
and
inhaling
its
vapor
they
gained
the
power
to
foresee
things
and
the
gift
of
prophecy
came
to
them
and
so
they
set
a
tripod
over
the
crevice
for
a
seat
and
they
built
a
temple
small
at
first
over
the
tripod
and
they
sent
for
the
wisest
maidens
in
the
land
to
come
and
sit
upon
the
tripod
and
breathe
the
strange
vapor
so
that
they
could
tell
what
was
otherwise
hidden
from
human
knowledge
some
say
that
the
vapor
is
the
breath
of
a
python
or
great
serpent
and
they
call
the
priestess
who
sits
upon
the
tripod
pythia
but
i
know
nothing
about
that
are
you
sure
asked
phemius
that
it
was
your
grandfather
who
first
found
that
crevice
in
the
rock
i
am
not
quite
sure
said
the
shepherd
but
i
heard
the
story
when
i
was
a
little
child
and
i
know
that
it
was
either
my
grandfather
or
my
grandfather
s
grandfather
at
any
rate
it
all
happened
many
many
years
ago
by
this
time
they
had
finished
their
meal
and
after
they
had
given
thanks
to
the
powers
who
had
thus
far
kindly
prospered
them
they
hastened
to
renew
their
journey
two
of
the
oarsmen
who
were
landsmen
as
well
as
seamen
were
to
go
with
them
to
carry
their
luggage
and
the
little
presents
which
laertes
had
sent
to
the
priests
at
delphi
the
shepherd
was
to
be
their
guide
and
a
second
shepherd
was
to
keep
them
company
so
as
to
help
them
in
case
of
need
the
sun
was
high
over
their
heads
when
they
were
ready
to
begin
their
long
and
toilsome
walk
the
road
at
first
was
smooth
and
easy
winding
through
meadows
and
orchards
and
shady
pastures
but
very
soon
the
way
became
steep
and
uneven
and
the
olive
trees
gave
place
to
pines
and
the
meadows
to
barren
rocks
the
little
company
toiled
bravely
onward
however
the
two
shepherds
leading
the
way
and
cheering
them
with
pleasant
melodies
on
their
flutes
while
the
two
sailors
with
their
heavy
loads
followed
in
the
rear
it
was
quite
late
in
the
day
when
they
reached
the
sacred
town
of
delphi
nestling
in
the
very
bosom
of
parnassus
the
mighty
mountain
wall
now
rose
straight
up
before
them
seeming
to
reach
even
to
the
clouds
the
priests
who
kept
the
temple
met
them
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
and
kindly
welcomed
them
for
the
sake
of
king
laertes
whom
they
knew
and
had
seen
and
they
besought
the
wayfarers
to
abide
for
some
time
in
delphi
nor
indeed
would
phemius
have
thought
of
going
farther
until
he
had
prayed
to
bright
apollo
and
offered
rich
gifts
at
his
shrine
and
questioned
the
pythian
priestess
about
the
unknown
future
and
so
odysseus
and
his
tutor
became
the
honored
guests
of
the
delphian
folk
and
they
felt
that
surely
they
were
now
at
the
very
centre
of
the
world
their
hosts
dealt
so
kindly
with
them
that
a
whole
month
passed
and
still
they
were
in
delphi
and
as
they
talked
with
the
priests
in
the
temple
or
listened
to
the
music
of
the
mountain
nymphs
or
drank
sweet
draughts
of
wisdom
from
the
castalian
spring
they
every
day
found
it
harder
and
harder
to
tear
themselves
away
from
the
delightful
place
iv
apollo
one
morning
odysseus
sat
in
the
shadow
of
parnassus
with
one
of
the
priests
of
apollo
and
they
talked
of
many
wonderful
things
and
the
boy
began
to
think
to
himself
that
there
was
more
wisdom
in
the
words
of
his
companion
than
in
all
the
waters
of
the
castalian
spring
he
could
see
from
where
he
sat
the
stream
of
that
fountain
flowing
out
of
the
rocks
between
two
cliffs
and
falling
in
sparkling
cascades
down
the
steep
slopes
men
think
that
they
gain
wisdom
by
drinking
from
that
spring
said
he
to
the
priest
but
i
think
that
they
gain
it
in
quite
another
way
they
drink
of
its
waters
every
day
but
while
they
drink
they
listen
to
the
wonderful
words
which
fall
from
your
lips
and
they
become
wise
by
hearing
and
not
by
drinking
the
old
priest
smiled
at
the
shrewdness
of
the
boy
let
them
think
as
they
please
said
he
in
any
case
their
wisdom
would
come
hard
and
be
of
little
use
if
it
were
not
for
the
apollo
tell
me
about
apollo
said
odysseus
the
priest
could
not
have
been
better
pleased
he
moved
his
seat
so
that
he
could
look
the
boy
full
in
the
face
and
at
the
same
time
have
the
temple
before
him
and
then
he
began
a
very
long
time
ago
apollo
was
born
in
distant
delos
and
when
the
glad
news
of
his
birth
was
told
earth
smiled
and
decked
herself
with
flowers
the
nymphs
of
delos
sang
songs
of
joy
that
were
heard
to
the
utmost
bounds
of
hellas
and
choirs
of
white
swans
flew
seven
times
around
the
island
piping
notes
of
praise
to
the
pure
being
who
had
come
to
dwell
among
men
then
zeus
looked
down
from
high
olympus
and
crowned
the
babe
with
a
golden
and
put
into
his
hands
a
silver
bow
and
a
lyre
such
as
no
man
had
ever
seen
and
he
gave
him
a
team
of
white
swans
to
drive
and
bade
him
go
forth
to
teach
men
the
things
which
are
right
and
good
and
to
make
light
that
which
is
hidden
and
in
darkness
and
so
apollo
arose
beautiful
as
the
morning
sun
and
journeyed
through
many
lands
seeking
a
he
stopped
for
a
time
at
the
foot
of
mount
olympus
and
played
so
sweetly
upon
his
lyre
that
zeus
and
all
his
court
were
entranced
then
he
went
into
pieria
and
iolcos
and
he
wandered
up
and
down
through
the
whole
length
of
the
thessalian
land
but
nowhere
could
he
find
a
spot
in
which
he
was
willing
to
dwell
then
he
climbed
into
his
car
and
bade
his
fly
with
him
to
the
country
of
the
hyperboreans
beyond
the
northern
mountains
forthwith
they
obeyed
and
through
the
pure
regions
of
the
upper
air
they
bore
him
winging
their
way
ever
northward
they
carried
him
over
the
desert
flats
where
the
shepherd
folk
of
scythia
dwell
in
houses
of
perched
on
wagons
and
daily
drive
their
flocks
and
herds
to
fresher
pastures
they
carried
him
over
that
unknown
land
where
the
arimaspian
host
of
horsemen
dwell
beside
a
river
running
bright
with
gold
and
on
the
seventh
day
they
came
to
the
great
rhipæan
mountains
where
the
griffins
with
lion
bodies
and
eagle
wings
guard
the
golden
treasures
of
the
north
in
these
mountains
the
north
wind
has
his
home
and
from
his
deep
caves
he
now
and
then
comes
forth
chilling
with
his
cold
and
angry
breath
the
orchards
and
the
fair
fields
of
hellas
and
bringing
death
and
dire
disasters
in
his
train
but
northward
this
blustering
boreas
can
not
blow
for
the
mountains
stand
like
a
wall
against
him
and
drive
him
back
and
hence
it
is
that
beyond
these
mountains
the
storms
of
winter
never
come
but
one
happy
springtime
runs
through
all
the
year
there
the
flowers
bloom
and
the
grain
ripens
and
the
fruits
drop
mellowing
to
the
earth
and
the
red
wine
is
pressed
from
the
luscious
grape
every
day
the
same
and
the
hyperboreans
who
dwell
in
that
favored
land
know
neither
pain
nor
sickness
nor
wearying
labor
nor
eating
care
but
their
youth
is
as
unfading
as
the
springtime
and
old
age
with
its
wrinkles
and
its
sorrows
is
evermore
a
stranger
to
them
for
the
spirit
of
evil
which
leads
all
men
to
err
has
never
found
entrance
among
them
and
they
are
free
from
vile
passions
and
unworthy
thoughts
and
among
them
there
is
neither
war
nor
wicked
deeds
nor
fear
of
the
avenging
furies
for
their
hearts
are
pure
and
clean
and
never
burdened
with
the
love
of
self
when
the
of
apollo
had
carried
him
over
the
rhipæan
mountains
they
alighted
in
the
hyperborean
land
and
the
people
welcomed
apollo
with
shouts
of
joy
and
songs
of
triumph
as
one
for
whom
they
had
long
been
waiting
and
he
took
up
his
abode
there
and
dwelt
with
them
one
whole
year
delighting
them
with
his
presence
and
ruling
over
them
as
their
king
but
when
twelve
moons
had
passed
he
bethought
him
that
the
toiling
suffering
men
of
hellas
needed
most
his
aid
and
care
therefore
he
bade
the
hyperboreans
farewell
and
again
went
up
into
his
car
and
his
winged
team
carried
him
back
to
the
land
of
his
birth
long
time
apollo
sought
a
place
where
he
might
build
a
temple
to
which
men
might
come
to
learn
of
him
and
to
seek
his
help
in
time
of
need
at
length
he
came
to
the
plain
of
fair
tilphussa
by
the
shore
of
lake
copais
and
there
he
began
to
build
a
house
for
the
land
was
a
pleasant
one
and
rich
in
grain
and
fruit
but
the
nymph
tilphussa
liked
not
to
have
apollo
dwell
so
near
her
lest
men
seeing
and
loving
him
should
forget
to
honor
her
and
one
day
garmented
with
mosses
and
crowned
with
lilies
she
came
and
stood
before
him
in
the
sunlight
apollo
of
the
silver
bow
said
she
have
you
not
made
a
mistake
in
choosing
this
place
for
a
dwelling
these
rich
plains
around
us
will
not
always
be
as
peaceful
as
now
for
their
very
richness
will
tempt
the
spoiler
and
the
song
of
the
cicada
will
then
give
place
to
the
din
of
battle
even
in
times
of
peace
you
would
hardly
have
a
quiet
hour
here
for
great
herds
of
cattle
come
crowding
down
every
day
to
my
lake
for
water
and
the
noisy
ploughman
driving
his
team
afield
disturbs
the
morning
hour
with
his
boorish
shouts
and
boys
and
dogs
keep
up
a
constant
din
and
make
life
in
this
place
a
fair
tilphussa
said
apollo
i
had
hoped
to
dwell
here
in
thy
happy
vale
a
neighbor
and
friend
to
thee
yet
since
this
place
is
not
what
it
seems
to
be
whither
shall
i
go
and
where
shall
i
build
my
house
go
to
the
cleft
in
parnassus
where
the
swift
eagles
of
zeus
met
above
the
earth
s
centre
answered
the
nymph
there
thou
canst
dwell
in
peace
and
men
will
come
from
all
parts
of
the
world
to
do
thee
and
so
apollo
came
down
towards
crissa
and
here
in
the
cleft
of
the
mountain
he
laid
the
foundations
of
his
shrine
then
he
called
the
of
the
world
trophonius
and
agamedes
and
gave
to
them
the
building
of
the
high
walls
and
the
massive
roof
and
when
they
had
finished
their
work
he
said
say
now
what
reward
you
most
desire
for
your
labor
and
i
will
give
it
give
us
said
the
brothers
that
which
is
the
best
for
it
is
well
answered
apollo
when
the
full
moon
is
seen
above
the
you
shall
have
your
wish
but
when
the
moon
rose
full
and
clear
above
the
heights
the
two
brothers
were
dead
illustration
apollo
slaying
the
python
and
apollo
was
pleased
with
the
place
which
he
had
chosen
for
a
home
for
here
were
peace
and
quiet
and
neither
the
hum
of
labor
nor
the
din
of
battle
would
be
likely
ever
to
enter
yet
there
was
one
thing
to
be
done
before
he
could
have
perfect
rest
there
lived
near
the
foot
of
the
mountain
a
huge
serpent
called
python
which
was
the
terror
of
all
the
land
oftentimes
coming
out
of
his
den
this
monster
attacked
the
flocks
and
herds
and
sometimes
even
their
keepers
and
he
had
been
known
to
carry
little
children
and
helpless
women
to
his
den
and
there
devour
them
the
men
of
delphi
came
one
day
to
apollo
and
prayed
him
to
drive
out
or
destroy
their
terrible
enemy
so
taking
in
hand
his
silver
bow
he
sallied
out
at
break
of
day
to
meet
the
monster
when
he
should
issue
from
his
slimy
cave
the
vile
creature
shrank
back
when
he
saw
the
radiant
god
before
him
and
would
fain
have
hidden
himself
in
the
deep
gorges
of
the
mountain
but
apollo
quickly
launched
a
swift
arrow
at
him
crying
thou
bane
of
man
lie
thou
upon
the
earth
and
enrich
it
with
thy
dead
body
and
the
arrow
sped
to
the
mark
and
the
great
beast
died
wallowing
in
his
gore
and
the
people
in
their
joy
came
out
to
meet
the
archer
singing
pæans
in
his
praise
and
they
crowned
him
with
wild
flowers
and
wreaths
of
olives
and
hailed
him
as
the
pythian
king
and
the
nightingales
sang
to
him
in
the
groves
and
the
swallows
and
cicadas
twittered
and
tuned
their
melodies
in
harmony
with
his
lyre
see
note
at
the
end
of
this
volume
but
as
yet
there
were
no
priests
in
apollo
s
temple
and
he
pondered
long
doubting
as
to
whom
he
should
choose
one
day
he
stood
upon
the
mountain
s
peak
whence
he
could
see
all
hellas
and
the
seas
around
it
far
away
in
the
south
he
spied
a
little
ship
sailing
from
crete
to
sandy
pylos
and
the
men
who
were
on
board
were
cretan
merchants
these
men
shall
serve
in
my
temple
he
cried
upward
he
sprang
and
high
he
soared
above
the
sea
then
swiftly
descending
like
a
fiery
star
he
plunged
into
the
waves
there
he
changed
himself
into
the
form
of
a
dolphin
and
swam
with
speed
to
overtake
the
vessel
long
before
the
ship
had
reached
pylos
the
mighty
fish
came
up
with
it
and
struck
its
stern
the
crew
were
dumb
with
terror
and
sat
still
in
their
places
their
oars
were
motionless
the
sail
hung
limp
and
useless
from
the
mast
yet
the
vessel
sped
through
the
waves
with
the
speed
of
the
wind
for
the
dolphin
was
driving
it
forward
by
the
force
of
his
fins
past
many
a
headland
past
pylos
and
many
pleasant
harbors
they
hastened
vainly
did
the
pilot
try
to
land
at
cyparissa
and
at
cyllene
the
ship
would
not
obey
her
helm
they
rounded
the
headland
of
araxus
and
came
into
the
long
bay
of
crissa
and
there
the
dolphin
left
off
guiding
the
vessel
and
swam
playfully
around
it
while
a
brisk
west
wind
filled
the
sail
and
bore
the
voyagers
safely
into
port
then
the
dolphin
changed
into
the
form
of
a
glowing
star
which
shooting
high
into
the
heavens
lit
up
the
whole
world
with
its
glory
and
as
the
crew
stood
gazing
at
the
wonder
it
fell
with
the
quickness
of
light
upon
parnassus
into
his
temple
apollo
hastened
and
there
he
kindled
an
undying
fire
then
in
the
form
of
a
handsome
youth
with
golden
hair
falling
in
waves
upon
his
shoulders
he
hastened
to
the
beach
to
welcome
the
cretan
strangers
hail
seamen
he
cried
who
are
you
and
from
whence
do
you
come
shall
i
greet
you
as
friends
and
guests
or
shall
i
know
you
as
robbers
bringing
death
and
distress
to
many
a
fair
home
then
answered
the
cretan
captain
fair
stranger
the
gods
have
brought
us
hither
for
by
no
wish
of
our
own
have
we
come
we
are
cretan
merchants
and
we
were
on
our
way
to
sandy
pylos
with
stores
of
merchandise
to
barter
with
the
tradesmen
of
that
city
but
some
unknown
being
whose
might
is
greater
than
the
might
of
men
has
carried
us
far
beyond
our
port
even
to
this
unknown
shore
tell
us
now
we
pray
thee
what
land
is
this
and
who
art
thou
who
lookest
so
like
a
god
friends
and
guests
for
such
indeed
you
must
be
answered
the
radiant
youth
think
never
again
of
sailing
upon
the
sea
but
draw
now
your
vessel
high
up
on
the
beach
and
when
you
have
brought
out
all
your
goods
and
built
an
altar
upon
the
shore
take
of
your
white
barley
which
you
have
with
you
and
offer
it
reverently
to
phœbus
apollo
for
i
am
he
and
it
was
i
who
brought
you
hither
so
that
you
might
keep
my
temple
and
make
known
my
wishes
unto
men
and
since
it
was
in
the
form
of
a
dolphin
that
you
first
saw
me
let
the
town
which
stands
around
my
temple
be
known
as
delphi
and
let
men
worship
me
there
as
apollo
then
the
cretans
did
as
he
had
bidden
them
they
drew
their
vessel
high
up
on
the
white
beach
and
when
they
had
unladen
it
of
their
goods
they
built
an
altar
on
the
shore
and
offered
white
barley
to
phœbus
apollo
and
gave
thanks
to
the
powers
who
had
saved
them
from
the
terrors
of
the
deep
and
after
they
had
feasted
and
rested
from
their
long
voyage
they
turned
their
faces
toward
parnassus
and
apollo
playing
sweeter
music
than
men
had
ever
heard
led
the
way
and
the
folk
of
delphi
with
choirs
of
boys
and
maidens
came
to
meet
them
and
they
sang
a
pæan
and
songs
of
victory
as
they
helped
the
cretans
up
the
steep
pathway
to
the
cleft
of
parnassus
i
leave
you
now
to
have
sole
care
of
my
temple
said
apollo
i
charge
you
to
keep
it
well
deal
righteously
with
all
men
let
no
unclean
thing
pass
your
lips
forget
self
guard
well
your
thoughts
and
keep
your
hearts
free
from
guile
if
you
do
these
things
you
shall
be
blessed
with
length
of
days
and
all
that
makes
life
glad
but
if
you
forget
my
words
and
deal
treacherously
with
men
and
cause
any
to
wander
from
the
path
of
right
then
shall
you
be
driven
forth
homeless
and
accursed
and
others
shall
take
your
places
in
the
service
of
my
and
then
the
bright
youth
left
them
and
hastened
away
into
thessaly
and
to
mount
olympus
but
every
year
he
comes
again
and
looks
into
his
house
and
speaks
words
of
warning
and
of
hope
to
his
servants
and
often
men
have
seen
him
on
parnassus
playing
his
lyre
to
the
listening
muses
or
with
his
sister
artemis
chasing
the
mountain
deer
such
was
the
story
which
the
old
priest
related
to
odysseus
sitting
in
the
shadow
of
the
mountain
and
the
boy
listened
with
eyes
wide
open
and
full
of
wonder
half
expecting
to
see
the
apollo
standing
by
his
side
king
of
cattle
thieves
odysseus
and
his
tutor
tarried
as
i
have
told
you
a
whole
month
at
delphi
for
phemius
would
not
venture
farther
on
their
journey
until
the
pythian
oracle
should
tell
him
how
it
would
end
in
the
mean
while
many
strangers
were
daily
coming
from
all
parts
of
hellas
bringing
rich
gifts
for
apollo
s
temple
and
seeking
advice
from
the
pythia
from
these
strangers
odysseus
learned
many
things
concerning
lands
and
places
of
which
he
never
before
had
heard
and
nothing
pleased
him
better
than
to
listen
to
the
marvellous
tales
which
each
man
told
about
his
own
home
and
people
one
day
as
he
was
walking
towards
the
spring
of
castalia
an
old
man
who
had
come
from
corinth
to
ask
questions
of
the
pythia
met
him
and
stopped
to
talk
with
him
young
prince
said
the
old
man
what
business
can
bring
one
so
young
as
you
to
this
place
sacred
to
apollo
i
am
on
my
way
to
visit
my
grandfather
said
odysseus
and
i
have
stopped
here
for
a
few
days
while
my
tutor
consults
the
oracle
your
grandfather
and
who
is
your
grandfather
asked
the
old
man
the
great
chief
autolycus
whose
halls
are
on
the
other
side
of
parnassus
answered
odysseus
the
old
man
drew
a
long
breath
and
after
a
moment
s
silence
said
perhaps
then
you
are
going
to
help
your
grandfather
take
care
of
his
neighbors
cattle
i
do
not
know
what
you
mean
answered
odysseus
startled
by
the
tone
in
which
the
stranger
spoke
these
words
i
mean
that
your
grandfather
who
is
the
most
cunning
of
men
will
expect
to
teach
you
his
trade
said
the
man
with
a
strange
twinkle
in
his
eye
my
grandfather
is
a
chieftain
and
a
hero
said
the
boy
what
trade
has
he
you
pretend
not
to
know
that
he
is
a
answered
the
old
man
shrugging
his
shoulders
why
all
hellas
has
known
him
these
hundred
years
as
the
king
of
cattle
thieves
but
he
is
very
old
now
and
the
herdsmen
and
shepherds
have
little
to
fear
from
him
any
more
yet
mind
my
words
young
prince
it
does
not
require
the
wisdom
of
the
pythian
oracle
to
foretell
that
you
his
grandson
will
become
the
craftiest
of
men
with
autolycus
for
your
grandfather
and
hermes
for
your
it
would
be
hard
indeed
for
you
to
be
otherwise
at
this
moment
the
bard
phemius
came
up
and
the
old
man
walked
quickly
away
what
does
he
mean
asked
odysseus
turning
to
his
tutor
what
does
he
mean
by
saying
that
my
grandfather
is
the
king
of
cattle
thieves
and
by
speaking
of
hermes
as
my
they
tell
strange
tales
about
autolycus
the
mountain
chief
phemius
answered
but
whether
their
stories
be
true
or
false
i
can
not
say
the
old
man
who
was
talking
to
you
is
from
corinth
where
once
reigned
sisyphus
a
most
cruel
and
crafty
king
from
corinth
sisyphus
sent
ships
and
traders
to
all
the
world
and
the
wealth
of
hellas
might
have
been
his
had
he
but
loved
the
truth
and
dealt
justly
with
his
but
there
was
no
honor
in
his
soul
he
betrayed
his
dearest
friends
for
gold
and
he
crushed
under
a
huge
block
of
stone
the
strangers
who
came
to
corinth
to
barter
their
merchandise
it
is
said
that
once
upon
a
time
autolycus
went
down
to
corinth
in
the
night
and
carried
away
all
the
cattle
of
sisyphus
driving
them
to
his
great
pastures
beyond
parnassus
not
long
afterward
sisyphus
went
boldly
to
your
grandfather
s
halls
and
said
i
have
come
autolycus
to
get
again
my
cattle
which
you
have
been
so
kindly
it
is
well
said
autolycus
go
now
among
my
herds
and
if
you
find
any
cattle
bearing
your
mark
upon
them
they
are
yours
drive
them
back
to
your
own
pastures
this
is
the
offer
which
i
make
to
every
man
who
comes
claiming
that
i
have
stolen
his
then
sisyphus
to
your
grandfather
s
great
surprise
went
among
the
herds
and
chose
his
own
without
making
a
single
error
see
you
not
my
initial
sigma
symbol
under
the
hoof
of
each
of
these
beasts
asked
sisyphus
autolycus
saw
at
once
that
he
had
been
outwitted
and
he
fain
would
have
made
friends
with
one
who
was
more
crafty
than
himself
but
sisyphus
dealt
treacherously
with
him
as
he
did
with
every
one
who
trusted
him
yet
men
say
that
now
he
is
dead
he
has
his
reward
in
hades
for
there
he
is
doomed
to
the
toil
of
heaving
a
heavy
stone
to
the
top
of
a
hill
only
to
see
it
roll
back
again
to
the
plain
it
was
from
him
that
men
learned
to
call
your
grandfather
the
king
of
cattle
thieves
with
how
much
justice
you
may
judge
for
yourself
see
note
at
the
end
of
this
volume
you
have
explained
a
part
of
what
i
asked
you
said
odysseus
thoughtfully
but
you
have
not
answered
my
question
about
hermes
i
will
answer
that
at
another
time
said
phemius
for
we
must
renew
our
journey
and
i
must
go
now
and
put
every
thing
in
readiness
see
note
at
the
end
of
this
volume
but
has
the
oracle
spoken
asked
odysseus
in
surprise
the
pythia
has
answered
my
question
said
the
bard
i
asked
what
fortune
should
attend
you
on
this
journey
and
the
oracle
made
this
reply
to
home
and
kindred
he
shall
safe
return

er
long
with
scars
and
greeted
with
triumphal
what
does
it
mean
asked
odysseus
just
what
it
says
answered
the
bard
all
that
is
now
needed
is
that
we
should
do
our
part
and
fortune
will
surely
smile
upon
us
and
so
on
the
morrow
they
bade
their
kind
hosts
farewell
and
began
to
climb
the
steep
pathway
which
they
were
told
led
up
and
around
to
the
halls
of
autolycus
at
the
top
of
the
first
slope
they
came
upon
a
broad
from
the
centre
of
which
rose
the
peak
of
parnassus
towering
to
the
skies
around
the
base
of
this
peak
huge
rocks
were
piled
one
above
the
other
just
as
they
had
been
thrown
in
the
days
of
old
from
the
mighty
hands
of
the
titans
on
every
side
were
clefts
and
chasms
and
deep
gorges
through
which
flowed
roaring
torrents
fed
from
the
melting
snows
above
and
in
the
sides
of
the
cliffs
were
dark
caves
and
narrow
grottos
hollowed
from
the
solid
rock
wherein
strange
creatures
were
said
to
dwell
now
and
then
odysseus
fancied
that
he
saw
a
mountain
nymph
flitting
among
the
trees
or
a
satyr
with
shaggy
beard
hastily
hiding
himself
among
the
clefts
and
crags
above
them
they
passed
by
the
great
corycian
cavern
whose
huge
vaulted
chambers
would
shelter
a
thousand
men
but
they
looked
in
vain
for
the
nymph
corycia
who
they
were
told
sometimes
sat
within
and
smiled
upon
passing
travellers
a
little
farther
beyond
they
heard
the
mellow
notes
of
a
lyre
and
the
sound
of
laughter
and
in
a
grove
of
evergreens
lower
down
the
and
odysseus
wondered
if
apollo
and
the
muses
were
not
there
the
path
which
the
little
company
followed
did
not
lead
to
the
summit
of
the
peak
but
wound
around
its
base
and
then
by
many
a
zigzag
led
downward
to
a
wooded
glen
through
the
middle
of
which
a
mountain
torrent
rushed
by
and
by
the
glen
widened
into
a
pleasant
valley
broad
and
green
bounded
on
three
sides
by
steep
mountain
walls
here
were
rich
and
a
meadow
in
which
odysseus
saw
thousands
of
cattle
grazing
the
guide
told
them
that
those
were
the
pastures
and
the
cattle
of
great
autolycus
close
to
the
bank
of
the
mountain
torrent
just
where
it
leaped
from
a
precipice
and
forgetting
its
wild
hurry
was
changed
to
a
quiet
meadow
brook
stood
the
dwelling
of
the
chief
it
was
large
and
low
and
had
been
hewn
out
of
the
solid
rock
it
looked
more
like
the
entrance
to
a
mountain
cave
than
like
the
palace
of
a
king
odysseus
and
his
tutor
walked
boldly
into
the
great
hall
for
the
low
doorway
was
open
and
unguarded
and
the
following
words
were
roughly
carved
in
the
rock
above
here
lives
autolycus
if
your
heart
is
brave
enter
they
passed
through
the
and
came
to
a
smaller
inner
chamber
there
they
saw
autolycus
seated
in
a
chair
of
ivory
and
gold
with
furs
and
near
him
sat
fair
amphithea
his
wife
busy
with
her
spindle
and
distaff
the
chief
was
very
old
his
white
hair
fell
in
waves
upon
his
great
shoulders
and
his
broad
brow
was
wrinkled
with
age
yet
his
frame
was
that
of
a
giant
and
his
eyes
glowed
and
sparkled
with
the
fire
of
youth
strangers
said
he
kindly
you
are
welcome
to
my
halls
it
is
not
often
that
men
visit
me
in
my
mountain
home
and
old
age
has
bound
me
here
in
my
chair
so
that
i
can
no
longer
walk
abroad
among
my
fellows
besides
this
there
are
those
who
of
late
speak
many
unkind
words
of
me
and
good
men
care
not
to
be
the
guests
of
him
who
is
called
the
king
of
cattle
thieves
then
seeing
that
his
visitors
still
lingered
at
the
door
he
added
i
pray
you
whoever
you
may
be
fear
not
but
enter
and
be
assured
of
a
kind
welcome
then
odysseus
went
fearlessly
forward
and
stood
before
the
chief
and
made
himself
known
and
showed
them
the
presents
which
his
mother
anticleia
had
sent
glad
indeed
was
the
heart
of
old
autolycus
as
he
grasped
the
hand
of
his
grandson
and
amphithea
took
the
lad
in
her
arms
and
kissed
his
brow
and
both
his
eyes
and
wept
for
very
fulness
of
joy
then
at
a
call
from
the
old
chief
an
inner
door
was
opened
and
his
six
sons
came
in
stalwart
men
were
they
with
limbs
strong
as
iron
and
eyes
like
those
of
the
mountain
eagle
and
they
warmly
welcomed
the
young
prince
and
asked
him
a
thousand
questions
about
his
home
in
ithaca
and
his
their
sister
anticleia
waste
not
the
hours
in
talk
cried
old
autolycus
at
last
there
is
yet
another
day
for
words
make
ready
at
once
a
fitting
feast
for
this
my
grandson
and
his
friend
the
bard
and
let
our
halls
ring
loud
with
joyful
merriment
the
sons
at
once
obeyed
from
the
herd
which
was
pasturing
in
the
meadows
they
chose
the
fattest
calf
this
they
slew
and
quickly
dressed
and
then
cutting
off
the
choicest
parts
they
roasted
them
on
spits
before
the
blazing
fire
and
when
the
meal
was
ready
great
autolycus
his
wife
and
his
sons
sat
down
with
their
guests
at
the
table
and
they
feasted
merrily
until
the
sun
went
down
and
darkness
covered
the
earth
then
the
young
men
brought
of
dry
branches
and
logs
of
pine
and
threw
them
upon
the
fire
and
the
blaze
leaped
up
and
lighted
the
hall
with
a
rich
ruddy
glow
and
odysseus
sat
upon
a
couch
of
bearskins
at
his
grandfather
s
feet
and
listened
to
many
a
wonderful
story
of
times
long
past
but
ever
present
in
the
old
man
s
memory
truly
there
are
two
things
against
which
it
is
useless
for
any
man
to
fight
said
autolycus
and
these
are
old
age
and
death
the
first
has
already
made
me
his
slave
and
the
second
will
soon
have
me
in
his
clutches
when
i
was
young
there
was
not
a
man
who
could
outstrip
me
in
the
foot
race
i
even
thought
myself
a
match
for
the
maiden
atalanta
there
were
very
few
men
even
among
the
great
heroes
who
could
hurl
a
spear
with
more
force
than
i
and
there
was
hardly
one
who
could
bend
my
great
bow
but
now
both
spear
and
bow
are
useless
you
see
them
standing
in
the
corner
there
where
my
eyes
can
rest
upon
them
you
shall
help
me
polish
them
then
after
a
moment
s
pause
he
added
but
oh
the
wrestling
and
the
leaping
there
was
never
but
one
mortal
who
could
excel
me
in
either
i
have
heard
said
odysseus
that
even
great
heracles
was
your
pupil
and
such
indeed
he
was
answered
the
old
man
the
first
time
i
saw
the
matchless
hero
he
was
but
a
child
tall
and
beautiful
with
the
eyes
of
a
wild
deer
and
with
flaxen
hair
falling
over
his
shoulders
but
he
was
stronger
even
then
than
any
common
mortal
his
stepfather
amphitryon
called
me
to
thebes
to
be
the
boy
s
teacher
for
he
saw
in
him
rich
promises
of
future
greatness
with
me
he
called
many
of
the
noblest
men
of
hellas
first
there
was
eurytus
the
master
of
archers
who
taught
the
hero
how
to
bend
the
bow
and
send
the
swift
arrow
straight
to
the
mark
but
in
an
evil
day
eurytus
met
his
fate
and
all
through
his
own
folly
for
being
proud
of
his
skill
which
no
mortal
could
excel
he
challenged
great
apollo
to
a
shooting
match
and
the
angry
pierced
him
through
and
through
with
his
arrows
second
among
the
teachers
of
heracles
was
castor
the
brother
of
polydeuces
and
of
helen
the
most
beautiful
of
women
he
taught
the
hero
how
to
wield
the
spear
and
the
sword
then
there
was
linus
the
brother
of
orpheus
sweetest
of
musicians
who
came
to
teach
him
how
to
touch
the
lyre
and
bring
forth
bewitching
melody
but
the
boy
whose
mind
was
set
on
great
deeds
cared
naught
for
music
and
the
lessons
which
linus
gave
him
were
profitless
thou
art
but
a
dull
and
witless
youth
cried
the
minstrel
one
day
striking
his
pupil
upon
the
cheek
then
heracles
in
wrath
smote
linus
with
his
own
lyre
and
killed
him
even
a
dull
pupil
has
his
rights
said
he
and
one
of
these
is
the
right
not
to
be
called
a
the
theban
rulers
brought
the
young
hero
to
trial
for
his
crime
but
he
stood
up
before
them
and
reminded
them
of
a
law
which
rhadamanthus
the
ruler
of
the
elysian
land
had
given
them
defends
himself
against
an
unjust
attack
is
guiltless
and
shall
go
and
the
judges
pleased
with
his
wisdom
gave
him
his
liberty
did
heracles
have
any
other
teachers
asked
odysseus
anxious
to
hear
more
yes
amphytrion
himself
taught
the
lad
how
to
drive
a
chariot
skilfully
and
how
to
manage
horses
and
as
i
have
said
he
called
me
to
teach
him
the
manly
arts
of
leaping
and
running
and
wrestling
he
was
an
apt
pupil
and
soon
excelled
his
master
and
amphitryon
fearing
that
in
a
thoughtless
moment
he
might
serve
me
as
he
had
served
unlucky
linus
sent
him
away
to
mount
cithaeron
to
watch
his
herds
which
were
pasturing
there
surely
said
odysseus
looking
at
the
giant
arms
of
his
grandfather
ridged
with
iron
muscles
surely
there
was
no
danger
of
the
young
hero
harming
you
a
son
of
hermes
such
as
i
said
the
old
chief
might
dare
to
stand
against
heracles
in
craft
and
cunning
but
never
in
feats
of
strength
while
the
lad
fed
amphytrion
s
flocks
in
the
mountain
meadows
he
grew
to
be
a
giant
four
cubits
in
height
and
terrible
to
look
upon
his
voice
was
like
the
roar
of
a
desert
lion
his
step
was
like
the
march
of
an
earthquake
and
fire
flashed
from
his
eyes
like
the
glare
of
thunderbolts
when
they
are
hurled
from
the
storm
clouds
down
to
the
fruitful
plains
below
he
could
tear
up
trees
by
their
roots
and
hurl
mountain
crags
from
their
places
it
was
then
that
he
slew
the
cithæron
lion
with
his
bare
hands
and
took
its
skin
for
a
helmet
and
a
mantle
which
i
am
told
he
wears
to
this
very
day
only
a
little
while
after
this
he
led
the
thebans
into
a
battle
with
their
enemies
the
minyans
and
gained
for
them
a
glorious
victory
then
pallas
athené
well
pleased
with
the
hero
gave
him
a
purple
robe
hephaestus
made
for
him
a
breastplate
of
solid
gold
and
hermes
gave
him
a
sword
apollo
a
bow
and
poseidon
a
team
of
the
most
wonderful
horses
ever
known
then
that
he
might
be
fully
armed
he
went
into
the
nemæan
wood
and
cut
for
himself
that
stout
club
which
he
always
carries
and
which
is
more
terrible
in
his
hands
than
spear
or
sword
or
bow
and
arrows
i
have
heard
said
odysseus
that
cheiron
the
centaur
was
one
of
the
teachers
of
heracles
he
was
not
only
his
teacher
said
autolycus
but
he
was
his
friend
he
taught
what
was
just
and
true
he
showed
him
that
there
is
one
thing
greater
than
strength
and
that
is
gentleness
and
he
led
him
to
change
his
rude
savage
nature
into
one
full
of
kindness
and
love
so
that
in
all
the
world
there
is
no
one
so
full
of
pity
for
the
poor
and
weak
so
full
of
sympathy
for
the
as
is
heracles
the
strong
had
it
not
been
for
wise
cheiron
i
fear
that
heracles
would
not
have
made
the
happy
decision
which
he
once
did
when
the
choice
of
two
roads
was
offered
him
what
was
that
asked
odysseus
i
have
never
heard
about
it
when
heracles
was
a
youth
and
life
was
all
before
him
he
went
out
one
morning
to
do
an
errand
for
his
stepfather
amphitryon
but
as
he
walked
his
heart
was
full
of
bitter
thoughts
and
he
murmured
because
others
no
better
than
himself
were
living
in
ease
and
pleasure
while
for
him
there
was
naught
but
a
life
of
labor
and
pain
and
as
he
thought
upon
these
things
he
came
to
a
place
where
two
roads
met
and
he
stopped
not
certain
which
one
to
take
the
road
on
his
right
was
hilly
and
rough
there
was
no
beauty
in
it
or
about
it
but
he
saw
that
it
led
straight
towards
the
blue
mountains
in
the
far
distance
the
road
on
his
left
was
broad
and
smooth
with
shade
trees
on
either
side
where
sang
an
innumerable
choir
of
birds
and
it
went
winding
among
green
meadows
where
bloomed
countless
flowers
but
it
ended
in
fog
and
mist
long
before
it
ever
reached
the
wonderful
blue
mountains
in
the
distance
while
the
lad
stood
in
doubt
as
to
these
roads
he
saw
two
fair
women
coming
towards
him
each
on
a
different
road
the
one
who
came
by
the
flowery
way
reached
him
first
and
heracles
saw
that
she
was
beautiful
as
a
summer
day
her
cheeks
were
red
her
eyes
sparkled
she
spoke
warm
persuasive
words
o
noble
youth
she
said
be
no
longer
bowed
down
with
labor
and
sore
trials
but
come
and
follow
me
i
will
lead
you
into
pleasant
paths
where
there
are
no
storms
to
disturb
and
no
troubles
to
annoy
you
shall
live
in
ease
with
one
unending
round
of
music
and
mirth
and
you
shall
not
want
for
any
thing
that
makes
life
joyous
sparkling
wine
or
soft
couches
or
rich
robes
or
the
loving
eyes
of
beautiful
maidens
come
with
me
and
life
shall
be
to
you
a
of
by
this
time
the
other
fair
woman
had
drawn
near
and
she
now
spoke
to
the
lad
i
have
nothing
to
promise
you
said
she
save
that
which
you
shall
win
with
your
own
strength
the
road
upon
which
i
would
lead
you
is
uneven
and
hard
and
climbs
many
a
hill
and
descends
into
many
a
valley
and
quagmire
the
views
which
you
will
sometimes
get
from
the
hilltops
are
grand
and
glorious
but
the
deep
valleys
are
dark
and
the
ascent
from
them
is
toilsome
but
the
road
leads
to
the
blue
mountains
of
endless
fame
which
you
see
far
away
on
the
horizon
they
can
not
be
reached
without
labor
in
fact
there
is
nothing
worth
having
that
must
not
be
won
by
toil
if
you
would
have
fruits
and
flowers
you
must
plant
them
and
care
for
them
if
you
would
gain
the
love
of
your
you
must
love
them
and
suffer
for
them
if
you
would
enjoy
the
favor
of
heaven
you
must
make
yourself
worthy
of
that
favor
if
you
would
have
eternal
fame
you
must
not
scorn
the
hard
road
that
leads
to
then
heracles
saw
that
this
lady
although
she
was
as
beautiful
as
the
other
had
a
countenance
pure
and
gentle
like
the
sky
on
a
balmy
morning
in
may
what
is
your
name
he
asked
some
call
me
labor
she
answered
but
others
know
me
as
then
he
turned
to
the
first
lady
and
what
is
your
name
he
asked
some
call
me
pleasure
she
said
with
a
bewitching
smile
but
i
choose
to
be
known
as
the
joyous
and
happy
virtue
said
heracles
i
will
take
thee
as
my
guide
the
road
of
labor
and
honest
effort
shall
be
mine
and
my
heart
shall
no
longer
cherish
bitterness
or
and
he
put
his
hand
into
that
of
virtue
and
entered
with
her
upon
the
straight
and
forbidding
road
which
leads
to
the
fair
blue
mountains
on
the
pale
and
distant
horizon
see
note
at
the
end
of
this
volume
my
dear
grandson
make
thou
the
same
wise
choice
but
now
the
fire
has
burned
low
and
it
is
time
that
both
old
and
young
should
seek
repose
go
now
to
your
chamber
and
your
couch
and
pleasant
dreams
be
yours
until
the
new
day
dawns
bringing
its
labors
and
its
victories
vi
famous
boar
hunts
hardly
had
the
morning
tinged
the
eastern
sky
with
her
yellow
light
when
odysseus
arose
from
his
couch
and
quickly
clothed
himself
for
he
had
been
awakened
by
the
sound
of
hurrying
feet
and
many
voices
and
the
barking
of
dogs
beneath
his
chamber
window
when
he
went
down
into
the
great
hall
he
was
greeted
by
his
six
stalwart
uncles
all
of
whom
were
dressed
for
the
chase
and
armed
with
spears
and
knives
we
hunt
the
wild
boar
on
the
wooded
slopes
of
parnassus
said
echion
the
eldest
how
glad
we
should
be
if
you
were
old
enough
and
strong
enough
to
join
us
in
the
sport
the
heart
of
odysseus
was
stirred
at
once
like
that
of
a
warrior
when
he
hears
the
i
am
certainly
strong
enough
he
cried
i
will
ask
my
grandfather
if
i
may
go
autolycus
smiled
when
the
boy
made
known
his
wish
indeed
he
was
expecting
such
a
request
and
would
have
been
disappointed
and
displeased
if
it
had
not
been
made
yes
go
my
child
he
said
and
while
i
sit
here
bound
with
the
fetters
of
old
age
my
blessing
shall
go
with
you
odysseus
thanked
his
grandfather
and
lost
no
time
in
making
himself
ready
for
the
hunt
a
hasty
meal
was
eaten
and
then
the
huntsmen
with
a
great
number
of
dogs
and
sallied
forth
and
began
to
climb
the
mountain
slopes
the
master
of
the
hunt
was
an
old
man
one
of
the
last
of
the
ancient
race
of
heroes
whose
whole
life
had
been
spent
in
the
household
of
autolycus
old
as
he
was
he
outstrode
all
the
other
huntsmen
but
odysseus
young
and
supple
kept
close
behind
him
a
dwarf
following
in
the
wake
of
a
giant
upward
and
still
upward
they
toiled
while
their
comrades
with
the
hounds
followed
slowly
far
below
them
they
passed
through
the
belt
of
pine
trees
and
left
the
wooded
slopes
behind
there
was
now
nothing
but
bare
rocks
before
and
above
them
the
cold
winds
whistled
about
their
heads
the
mountain
eagles
soared
and
screamed
in
the
sharp
morning
air
surely
my
father
said
odysseus
the
lair
of
the
wild
boar
can
not
be
on
these
bleak
heights
would
it
not
be
better
to
seek
him
among
the
woods
of
the
lower
slopes
you
are
right
said
the
old
man
stopping
at
last
upon
one
of
the
highest
crags
i
have
brought
you
to
this
spot
not
in
search
of
game
but
to
show
you
what
is
a
truly
great
and
beautiful
sight
your
tutor
has
told
me
that
you
once
had
a
glimpse
of
the
world
from
mount
neritus
now
look
around
you
and
see
the
world
itself
then
the
lad
looked
and
far
away
on
the
blue
horizon
he
saw
the
silvery
heights
of
olympus
the
throne
of
mighty
zeus
glittering
in
the
sunlight
and
canopied
with
clouds
on
his
right
he
beheld
mount
helicon
and
the
fruitful
plains
of
bœotia
and
the
blue
sea
of
ægæa
stretching
away
and
away
towards
the
sunrise
halls
of
helios
southward
lay
the
bay
of
crissa
and
beyond
it
the
land
of
mighty
pelops
and
busy
corinth
and
the
rich
of
arcadia
then
turning
to
the
west
he
saw
like
a
mere
speck
on
the
horizon
his
own
loved
ithaca
while
nearer
were
the
woods
of
calydon
and
the
green
headlands
of
achaia
at
that
moment
the
clouds
which
had
been
hanging
about
the
suddenly
melted
away
and
the
sun
shone
out
bright
and
clear
bathing
the
woods
and
crags
in
purple
and
gold
while
at
the
same
time
the
music
of
ten
thousand
voices
of
birds
and
beasts
and
nymphs
and
waterfalls
was
borne
up
from
below
to
their
delighted
ears
is
not
this
a
beautiful
world
asked
the
aged
hero
baring
his
gray
head
to
the
cold
winds
what
would
you
not
give
to
have
it
all
for
your
own
the
lad
answered
not
a
word
but
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
as
he
thought
of
his
home
and
of
those
whom
he
loved
far
away
by
the
green
slopes
of
little
neritus
my
son
then
said
the
hero
remember
the
choice
of
heracles
happiness
is
to
be
gotten
from
within
us
it
is
not
to
be
bought
with
silver
and
gold
nor
yet
is
it
to
be
seized
upon
with
violence
better
have
a
clean
conscience
than
to
own
all
hellas
better
but
hark
i
hear
the
dogs
in
the
dells
far
below
us
let
us
hasten
down
for
they
have
started
the
game
within
a
thorny
thicket
where
grew
the
vines
and
leaves
so
closely
that
the
sun
s
rays
never
struggled
through
them
the
huge
wild
boar
had
made
his
lair
hither
the
hounds
had
tracked
him
and
their
deep
baying
and
the
trampling
of
many
feet
among
the
dead
leaves
upon
the
ground
had
roused
the
beast
and
stirred
him
into
fury
suddenly
he
sprang
from
his
lair
and
gnashing
his
huge
tusks
and
foaming
with
fury
he
charged
upon
his
foes
the
dogs
fell
back
afraid
to
come
too
close
to
an
enemy
so
fierce
and
strong
and
with
their
bays
they
made
the
echoes
of
parnassus
ring
just
at
this
moment
the
boy
odysseus
rushed
down
into
the
glen
his
long
spear
poised
and
ready
to
strike
but
the
great
beast
waited
not
for
the
stroke
he
dashed
furiously
at
the
boy
who
quickly
leaped
aside
although
too
late
the
boar
s
sharp
tusk
struck
odysseus
just
above
the
knee
cutting
a
fearful
gash
tearing
the
flesh
and
even
grazing
the
bone
but
the
lad
undaunted
struck
manfully
with
his
weapon
the
bright
spear
was
driven
straight
to
the
heart
of
the
beast
with
one
great
cry
he
fell
and
gnashing
his
huge
jaws
helplessly
he
died
among
the
withered
leaves
the
boy
faint
with
pain
and
the
joy
of
victory
staggered
into
the
arms
of
his
stalwart
uncles
who
had
hastened
to
succor
him
gently
they
bound
up
the
ghastly
wound
and
with
charms
and
witchery
stanched
the
flowing
blood
then
upon
a
litter
woven
of
vines
and
pliant
twigs
they
bore
him
down
the
deep
glen
to
the
broad
halls
of
old
autolycus
and
the
men
and
boys
having
flayed
the
grisly
beast
brought
afterward
its
head
and
bristly
hide
and
set
them
up
as
trophies
in
the
gateway
for
many
weary
days
odysseus
lay
helpless
on
a
couch
of
pain
but
his
kind
kinsmen
and
phemius
his
tutor
waited
on
him
tenderly
and
his
fair
grandmother
amphithea
nursed
him
and
when
the
pain
left
him
and
he
began
to
grow
strong
again
he
loved
to
lie
on
the
bearskins
at
his
grandfather
s
feet
and
listen
to
tales
of
the
earlier
days
when
the
older
race
of
heroes
walked
the
earth
when
i
was
younger
than
i
am
said
the
old
chief
as
they
sat
one
evening
in
the
light
of
the
blazing
brands
when
i
was
much
younger
than
now
it
was
my
fortune
to
take
part
in
the
most
famous
boar
hunt
the
world
has
ever
known
there
lived
at
that
time
in
calydon
a
mighty
chief
named
oineus
and
indeed
i
know
not
but
that
he
still
lives
oineus
was
rich
in
vineyards
and
in
orchards
and
no
other
man
in
all
ætolia
was
happier
or
more
blessed
than
he
he
had
married
early
in
life
the
princess
althea
fairest
of
the
acarnanian
maidens
and
to
them
a
son
had
been
born
and
beautiful
whom
they
called
meleager
when
meleager
was
yet
but
one
day
old
his
father
held
him
in
his
arms
and
prayed
to
zeus
and
the
powers
above
grant
father
zeus
and
all
ye
deathless
ones
that
this
my
son
may
be
the
foremost
among
the
men
of
hellas
and
let
it
come
to
pass
that
when
they
see
his
valiant
deeds
his
countrymen
shall
say
behold
this
youth
is
greater
than
his
father
and
all
of
one
accord
shall
hail
him
as
their
guardian
then
his
mother
althea
weeping
tears
of
joy
prayed
to
pallas
athené
that
the
boy
might
grow
up
to
be
and
gentle
the
hope
and
pride
of
his
parents
and
the
delight
and
staff
of
their
declining
years
scarcely
had
the
words
of
prayer
died
from
her
lips
when
there
came
into
her
chamber
the
three
unerring
fates
who
spin
the
destinies
of
men
and
garlanded
they
stood
beside
the
babe
and
with
unwearied
fingers
drew
out
the
lines
of
his
untried
life
sad
clotho
held
the
golden
distaff
in
her
hand
and
twirled
and
twisted
the
delicate
thread
lachesis
now
sad
now
hopeful
with
her
long
white
fingers
held
the
hourglass
and
framed
her
lips
to
say
it
is
and
atropos
blind
and
unpitying
as
the
future
always
is
stood
ready
with
cruel
shears
to
clip
the
twist
in
twain
busily
and
silently
sad
clotho
spun
and
the
golden
thread
thin
as
a
spider
s
web
yet
beautiful
as
a
sunbeam
grew
longer
and
more
golden
between
her
skilful
fingers
then
lachesis
cried
out
it
is
finished
but
atropos
hid
her
shears
beneath
her
mantle
and
said
not
so
behold
there
is
a
brand
burning
upon
the
hearth
wait
until
it
is
all
burned
into
ashes
and
smoke
and
then
i
will
cut
the
thread
of
the
child
s
life
spin
on
sweet
clotho
quick
as
thought
althea
sprang
forward
snatched
the
blazing
brand
from
the
hearth
and
quenched
its
flame
in
a
jar
of
water
and
when
she
knew
that
not
a
single
spark
was
left
glowing
upon
it
she
locked
it
safely
in
a
chest
where
none
but
she
could
find
it
as
she
did
this
the
pitiless
sisters
vanished
from
her
sight
saying
as
they
flitted
through
the
air
we
bide
our
see
note
at
the
end
of
this
volume
meleager
grew
up
to
be
a
tall
and
fair
and
gentle
youth
and
when
at
last
he
became
a
man
he
sailed
on
the
ship
argo
with
jason
and
laertes
your
father
and
the
great
heroes
of
that
day
to
colchis
in
search
of
the
golden
fleece
many
brave
deeds
were
his
in
foreign
lands
and
when
he
came
home
again
to
calydon
he
brought
with
him
a
fair
young
wife
gentle
cleopatra
daughter
of
idas
the
boaster
oineus
had
gathered
in
his
harvest
and
he
was
glad
and
thankful
in
his
heart
because
his
fields
had
yielded
plenteously
his
vines
had
been
loaded
with
purple
grapes
and
his
orchards
filled
with
abundance
of
pleasant
fruit
grateful
as
men
should
always
be
to
the
givers
of
peace
and
plenty
he
held
within
his
halls
a
harvest
festival
to
which
the
brave
and
beautiful
of
all
ætolia
came
happy
was
this
feast
and
the
hours
were
bright
with
smiles
and
sunshine
and
men
forgot
sorrow
and
labor
and
thought
only
of
the
gladness
of
life
then
oineus
took
of
the
of
his
fields
and
his
vineyards
and
his
orchards
and
offered
them
in
thankful
offerings
to
the
givers
of
good
but
he
forgot
to
deck
the
shrine
of
artemis
with
gifts
little
thinking
that
the
queen
cared
for
any
thing
which
mortal
men
might
offer
her
ah
woful
mistake
was
that
for
in
her
anger
at
the
slight
artemis
sent
a
savage
boar
with
ivory
tusks
and
foaming
mouth
to
overrun
the
lands
of
calydon
many
a
field
did
the
monster
ravage
many
a
tree
uproot
and
all
the
growing
vines
which
late
had
borne
so
rich
a
vintage
were
trampled
to
the
ground
sadly
troubled
was
oineus
and
the
chieftains
of
ætolia
knew
not
what
to
do
for
the
fierce
beast
could
not
be
slain
but
with
his
terrible
tusks
he
had
sent
many
a
rash
hunter
to
an
untimely
death
then
the
young
man
meleager
said
i
will
call
together
the
heroes
of
hellas
and
we
will
hunt
the
boar
in
the
woods
of
and
so
at
the
call
of
meleager
the
warriors
flocked
from
every
land
to
join
in
the
hunt
of
the
fierce
wild
boar
among
them
came
castor
and
polydeuces
the
twin
brothers
from
lacedæmon
and
idas
the
boaster
the
of
meleager
from
messene
and
mighty
jason
captain
of
the
argo
and
atalanta
the
daughter
of
iasus
of
arcadia
and
many
acarnanian
huntsmen
led
by
the
sons
of
thestios
althea
s
brothers
thither
also
did
i
autolycus
hasten
although
men
spitefully
said
that
i
was
far
more
skilful
in
taking
tame
beasts
than
in
slaying
wild
ones
nine
days
we
feasted
in
the
halls
of
oineus
and
every
day
we
tried
our
skill
with
bows
and
arrows
and
tested
the
strength
of
our
spears
on
the
tenth
the
bugles
sounded
and
hounds
and
huntsmen
gathered
in
the
courtyard
of
the
chief
chafing
for
the
hunt
but
a
proud
fellow
named
cepheus
of
arcadia
when
he
saw
fair
atalanta
equipped
for
the
chase
drew
back
disdainfully
and
said
in
my
country
it
is
not
the
custom
for
heroes
to
go
to
battle
or
to
hunt
side
by
side
with
women
woman
s
place
is
at
home
her
weapons
are
the
distaff
and
the
needle
her
duty
is
to
practise
well
the
household
virtues
if
you
allow
this
young
girl
to
join
in
this
hunt
then
i
will
turn
my
face
homeward
and
seek
in
the
arcadian
land
adventures
worthy
of
then
meleager
angrily
answered
in
the
arcadian
land
if
report
speaks
truly
the
deeds
deemed
worthiest
of
men
are
the
watching
of
flocks
and
the
tuning
of
the
shepherd
s
pipe
it
is
fear
not
bravery
that
makes
you
seek
an
excuse
to
leave
the
chase
of
the
wild
boar
before
it
is
begun
you
are
afraid
of
the
beast
and
you
are
still
more
afraid
of
the
maiden
atalanta
lest
she
should
prove
to
be
more
skilled
than
you
have
you
heard
how
when
an
infant
she
was
left
to
perish
on
the
parthenian
hill
and
would
have
died
had
not
a
cared
for
her
until
some
hunters
rescued
her
have
you
heard
how
as
she
grew
up
her
beauty
was
greater
than
that
of
any
other
maiden
and
how
no
one
but
artemis
the
could
shoot
the
swift
arrow
so
fair
and
straight
have
you
heard
what
she
did
on
the
ship
argo
when
with
jason
as
our
captain
we
sailed
to
the
utmost
bounds
of
the
earth
and
brought
home
with
us
the
fleece
of
gold
have
you
heard
how
with
her
own
arrows
she
slew
the
beastly
centaurs
rhoecus
and
hylaeus
because
they
dared
to
make
love
to
one
so
pure
and
beautiful
doubtless
you
have
heard
all
these
things
and
you
are
afraid
to
go
to
the
field
of
danger
with
one
so
much
nobler
than
yourself
go
back
then
to
your
arcadia
no
one
will
miss
you
in
the
then
cepheus
blushed
but
more
from
shame
than
anger
i
will
ride
with
you
into
the
wood
said
he
and
never
again
shall
any
man
accuse
me
of
having
a
timid
soon
we
sallied
forth
from
the
town
a
hundred
huntsmen
with
dogs
innumerable
through
the
fields
and
orchards
laid
waste
by
the
savage
beast
we
passed
and
atalanta
keen
of
sight
and
swift
of
foot
her
long
hair
floating
in
the
wind
behind
her
led
all
the
rest
it
was
not
long
until
in
a
narrow
dell
once
green
with
vines
and
trees
but
now
strewn
thick
with
withered
branches
we
roused
the
fierce
creature
from
his
lair
at
first
he
fled
followed
closely
by
the
baying
hounds
then
suddenly
he
faced
his
foes
with
gnashing
teeth
and
bloodshot
eyes
he
charged
furiously
upon
them
a
score
of
hounds
were
slain
outright
and
cepheus
rushing
blindly
onward
was
caught
by
the
beast
and
torn
in
pieces
by
his
sharp
tusks
brave
peleus
of
phthia
with
unsteady
aim
let
fly
an
arrow
from
his
bow
which
falling
short
of
the
mark
smote
his
friend
eurytion
full
in
the
breast
and
stretched
him
lifeless
upon
the
ground
then
atalanta
bounding
forward
struck
the
beast
a
deadly
blow
with
her
spear
he
stopped
short
his
furious
onslaught
and
amphiaraus
the
hero
and
prophet
of
argos
launching
a
swift
arrow
put
out
one
of
his
eyes
terrible
were
the
cries
of
the
wounded
creature
as
blinded
and
bleeding
he
made
a
last
charge
upon
the
huntsmen
but
meleager
with
a
skilful
pierced
his
heart
and
the
beast
fell
weltering
in
his
gore
great
joy
filled
the
hearts
of
the
calydonians
when
they
saw
the
scourge
of
their
land
laid
low
and
helpless
they
quickly
flayed
the
beast
and
the
heroes
who
had
shared
in
the
hunt
divided
the
flesh
among
them
but
the
head
and
the
bristly
hide
they
gave
to
meleager
not
to
me
does
the
prize
belong
he
cried
but
to
atalanta
the
huntress
for
the
first
wound
the
true
death
stroke
indeed
was
given
by
her
and
to
her
woman
though
she
be
all
honor
and
the
prize
must
be
with
these
words
he
bore
the
grinning
head
and
the
bristly
hide
to
the
fair
young
huntress
and
laid
them
at
her
feet
then
his
uncles
the
sons
of
acarnanian
thestios
rushed
angrily
forward
saying
that
no
woman
should
ever
bear
a
prize
away
from
them
and
they
seized
the
hide
and
would
have
taken
it
away
had
not
meleager
forbidden
them
yet
they
would
not
loose
their
hold
upon
the
prize
but
drew
their
swords
and
wrathfully
threatened
meleager
s
life
the
hero
s
heart
grew
hot
within
him
and
he
shrunk
not
from
the
affray
long
and
fearful
was
the
struggle
uncles
against
nephew
but
in
the
end
the
sons
of
thestios
lay
bleeding
upon
the
ground
while
the
victor
brought
again
the
boar
s
hide
and
laid
it
the
second
time
at
atalanta
s
feet
the
fair
huntress
took
the
prize
and
carried
it
away
with
her
to
deck
her
father
s
hall
in
the
pleasant
arcadian
land
and
the
heroes
when
they
had
feasted
nine
other
days
with
king
oineus
betook
themselves
to
their
own
homes
but
the
hearts
of
the
acarnanians
were
bitter
towards
meleager
because
of
the
death
of
the
sons
of
thestios
and
because
no
part
of
the
wild
boar
was
awarded
to
them
they
called
their
chiefs
around
them
and
all
their
brave
men
and
made
war
upon
king
oineus
and
meleager
many
battles
did
they
fight
round
calydon
and
among
the
ætolian
hills
yet
while
meleager
led
his
warriors
to
the
fray
the
acarnanians
fared
but
then
queen
althea
filled
with
grief
for
her
brothers
untimely
death
forgot
her
love
for
her
son
and
prayed
that
her
acarnanian
kinsmen
might
prevail
against
him
upon
the
hard
earth
she
knelt
she
beat
the
ground
with
her
hands
and
heaped
the
dust
about
her
and
weeping
bitter
tears
she
called
upon
hades
and
heartless
persephone
to
avenge
her
of
meleager
and
even
as
she
prayed
the
pitiless
furies
wandering
amid
the
darkness
heard
her
cries
and
came
obedient
to
her
wishes
when
meleager
heard
that
his
mother
had
turned
against
him
he
withdrew
in
sorrow
to
his
own
house
and
sought
comfort
and
peace
with
his
wife
fair
cleopatra
and
he
would
not
lead
his
warriors
any
more
to
battle
against
the
acarnanians
then
the
enemy
besieged
the
city
a
fearful
tumult
rose
about
the
gates
the
high
towers
were
assaulted
and
everywhere
the
calydonians
were
driven
back
dismayed
and
beaten
with
uplifted
hands
and
tearful
eyes
king
oineus
and
the
elders
of
the
city
came
to
meleager
and
besought
him
to
take
the
field
again
rich
gifts
they
offered
him
they
bade
him
choose
for
his
own
the
most
fertile
farm
in
calydon
at
the
least
fifty
acres
half
for
tillage
and
half
for
vines
but
he
would
not
listen
to
them
the
din
of
battle
thickened
outside
the
gates
the
towers
shook
with
the
thundering
blows
of
the
besiegers
old
oineus
with
trembling
limbs
climbed
up
the
stairway
to
his
son
s
secluded
chamber
and
weeping
prayed
him
to
come
down
and
save
the
city
from
fire
and
pillage
still
he
kept
silent
and
went
not
his
sisters
came
and
his
most
trusted
friends
come
meleager
they
prayed
forget
thy
grief
and
think
only
of
our
great
need
aid
thy
people
or
we
shall
all
perish
illustration
meleager
refuses
to
help
in
the
defence
of
the
city
none
of
these
prayers
moved
him
the
gates
were
beaten
down
the
enemy
was
within
the
walls
the
tide
of
battle
shook
the
very
tower
where
meleager
sat
the
doom
of
calydon
seemed
to
be
sealed
then
came
the
fair
cleopatra
and
knelt
before
her
husband
and
besought
him
to
withhold
no
longer
the
aid
which
he
alone
could
give
o
meleager
she
sobbed
none
but
thou
can
save
us
wilt
thou
sit
still
and
see
the
city
laid
in
ashes
thy
dearest
friends
slaughtered
and
thy
wife
and
sweet
babes
dragged
from
their
homes
and
sold
into
cruel
slavery
then
meleager
rose
and
girded
on
his
armor
to
the
streets
he
hastened
shouting
his
eagerly
and
hopefully
did
the
calydonian
warriors
rally
around
him
fiercely
did
they
meet
the
foe
terrible
was
the
bloodshed
back
from
the
battered
gates
and
the
crumbling
wall
the
acarnanian
hosts
were
driven
a
panic
seized
upon
them
they
turned
and
fled
and
not
many
of
them
escaped
the
swords
of
meleager
s
men
again
there
was
peace
in
calydon
and
the
orchards
of
king
oineus
blossomed
and
bore
fruit
as
of
old
but
the
gifts
and
large
rewards
which
the
elders
had
promised
to
meleager
were
forgotten
he
had
saved
his
country
but
his
countrymen
were
ungrateful
then
meleager
again
laid
aside
his
and
sought
the
quiet
of
his
own
home
and
the
cheering
presence
of
fair
cleopatra
for
the
remembrance
of
his
mother
s
curse
and
his
country
s
ingratitude
weighed
heavily
on
his
mind
and
he
cared
no
longer
to
mingle
with
his
then
it
was
that
althea
s
hatred
of
her
son
waxed
stronger
and
she
thought
of
the
brand
which
she
had
hidden
and
of
the
words
which
the
fatal
sisters
had
spoken
so
many
years
before
he
is
no
longer
my
son
said
she
and
why
should
i
withhold
the
burning
of
the
brand
he
can
never
again
bring
comfort
to
my
heart
for
the
blood
of
my
brothers
whom
i
loved
is
upon
his
and
she
took
the
charred
billet
from
the
place
where
she
had
hidden
it
and
cast
it
again
into
the
flames
and
as
it
slowly
burned
away
so
did
the
life
of
meleager
wane
lovingly
he
bade
his
wife
farewell
softly
he
whispered
a
prayer
to
the
unseen
powers
above
and
as
the
flickering
flames
of
the
fatal
brand
died
into
darkness
he
gently
breathed
his
last
then
remorse
seized
upon
althea
and
the
which
had
slept
in
her
bosom
was
reawakened
too
late
also
the
folk
of
calydon
remembered
who
it
was
that
had
saved
them
from
slavery
and
death
down
into
the
comfortless
halls
of
hades
althea
hastened
to
seek
her
son
s
forgiveness
the
loving
heart
of
cleopatra
surcharged
with
grief
was
broken
and
her
gentle
spirit
fled
to
the
world
of
shades
to
meet
that
of
her
and
meleager
s
sisters
would
not
be
consoled
so
great
was
the
sorrow
which
had
come
upon
them
and
they
wept
and
lamented
day
and
night
until
kind
artemis
in
pity
for
their
youth
changed
them
into
the
birds
which
we
call
meleagrides
lying
on
the
bearskins
at
his
grandfather
s
feet
and
listening
to
stories
like
this
odysseus
did
not
feel
that
time
was
burdensome
the
wound
upon
his
knee
healed
slowly
and
when
at
last
he
could
walk
again
a
white
scar
as
long
and
as
broad
as
a
finger
told
the
story
of
his
combat
with
the
fierce
wild
boar
by
this
time
the
summer
was
far
spent
and
the
bard
phemius
was
impatient
to
return
to
ithaca
the
grapes
in
your
father
s
vineyard
are
growing
purple
and
his
orchards
are
laden
with
ripening
fruit
said
he
to
odysseus
and
the
days
are
near
at
hand
when
your
anxious
mother
will
gaze
with
longing
over
the
sea
expecting
your
return
but
there
was
no
vessel
at
the
port
on
the
bay
to
carry
them
home
by
the
nearest
way
and
days
and
months
might
pass
ere
any
ship
sent
thither
by
laertes
would
arrive
how
then
were
they
to
return
to
ithaca
here
is
your
uncle
bold
echion
who
goes
to
iolcos
by
the
sea
carrying
gifts
and
a
message
from
autolycus
to
old
king
peleus
we
will
go
with
him
but
iolcos
is
farther
still
from
ithaca
said
odysseus
true
answered
phemius
but
from
iolcos
at
this
season
of
the
year
there
are
many
vessels
sailing
to
corinth
and
the
islands
of
the
sea
once
at
corinth
and
we
shall
find
no
lack
of
ships
to
carry
us
across
the
bay
of
crissa
to
our
own
loved
ithaca
and
thus
the
journey
home
was
planned
it
was
a
long
and
devious
route
by
way
of
iolcos
and
the
eubœan
sea
and
no
one
could
say
how
many
dangers
they
might
meet
or
how
many
delays
they
should
encounter
yet
nothing
better
could
be
done
if
they
would
return
before
the
summer
ended
the
great
autolycus
blessed
odysseus
on
departing
and
gave
him
rich
gifts
of
gold
and
priceless
gems
and
many
words
of
sage
advice
i
shall
see
thee
no
more
he
said
but
thy
name
shall
be
spoken
countless
ages
hence
and
men
shall
say
how
shrewd
and
brave
in
war
and
wise
in
counsel
was
odysseus
vii
old
cheiron
s
school
after
a
long
hard
journey
by
land
and
sea
odysseus
and
his
tutor
with
bold
echion
came
to
iolcos
aged
peleus
king
of
phthia
and
the
fertile
plains
of
iolcos
greeted
them
with
show
of
heartiest
welcome
for
he
remembered
that
laertes
had
been
his
friend
and
comrade
long
years
before
when
together
on
the
argo
they
sailed
the
briny
deep
and
he
was
glad
to
see
the
son
of
that
old
comrade
and
he
took
odysseus
by
the
hand
and
led
him
into
his
palace
and
gave
him
of
the
best
of
all
that
he
had
tarry
with
me
for
a
month
he
said
my
ships
are
now
at
sea
but
they
will
return
and
when
the
moon
rises
again
full
and
round
as
it
did
last
night
i
will
send
you
safe
to
corinth
on
the
shores
of
the
bay
of
crissa
and
so
odysseus
and
the
bard
staid
a
whole
month
at
iolcos
in
the
house
of
peleus
the
king
there
were
feasting
and
merriment
in
the
halls
every
day
and
yet
the
time
hung
heavily
for
the
boy
longed
to
his
own
loved
ithaca
and
could
hardly
wait
to
see
the
moon
grow
full
and
round
again
what
mountain
is
that
which
looms
up
so
grandly
on
our
left
and
whose
sides
seem
covered
with
dark
forests
asked
odysseus
one
day
as
he
walked
with
his
tutor
beside
the
sea
it
is
famous
mount
pelion
said
the
bard
and
that
other
mountain
with
the
steeper
sides
which
stands
out
faintly
against
the
far
horizon
is
the
scarcely
less
famed
ossa
i
have
heard
my
father
speak
of
piling
pelion
upon
ossa
said
odysseus
but
i
can
not
understand
how
that
can
be
done
there
were
once
two
brothers
the
tallest
that
the
earth
has
ever
reared
said
phemius
their
names
were
otus
and
ephialtes
and
they
threatened
to
make
war
even
against
the
deathless
ones
who
dwell
on
mount
olympus
they
boasted
that
they
would
pile
ossa
on
olympus
and
pelion
with
all
its
woods
upon
the
top
of
ossa
that
so
they
might
make
a
pathway
to
the
sky
and
had
they
lived
to
manhood
s
years
no
one
can
say
what
deeds
they
would
have
done
but
apollo
with
his
swift
arrows
slew
the
twain
ere
yet
the
down
had
bloomed
upon
their
cheeks
or
darkened
their
chins
with
the
promise
of
manhood
and
so
pelion
still
stands
beside
the
sea
and
ossa
in
its
own
place
guards
the
lovely
vale
of
tempe
see
odyssey
book
xi
oh
now
i
remember
something
else
about
mount
pelion
cried
odysseus
it
was
from
the
trees
which
grew
upon
its
sides
that
the
ship
argo
was
built
and
i
have
heard
my
father
tell
how
cheiron
the
centaur
once
lived
in
a
cave
on
pelion
and
taught
the
young
heroes
who
came
to
learn
of
him
and
how
young
jason
came
down
the
mountain
one
day
and
boldly
stood
before
king
pelias
who
had
robbed
old
æson
his
father
of
the
kingdom
which
was
rightfully
his
would
that
i
had
been
one
of
cheiron
s
pupils
and
had
shared
the
instruction
which
he
gave
to
those
youthful
heroes
the
old
centaur
still
lives
in
his
cave
on
mount
pelion
said
phemius
if
king
peleus
is
willing
we
will
go
and
see
him
and
so
the
next
day
the
two
went
out
of
iolcos
through
vineyards
and
fields
and
olive
orchards
towards
pelion
the
warder
of
the
shore
they
followed
a
winding
pathway
and
came
ere
long
to
the
foot
of
the
mighty
mountain
above
them
were
frowning
rocks
and
dark
forests
of
pine
which
seemed
ready
to
fall
upon
and
crush
them
but
among
the
trees
and
in
the
crannies
of
the
rocks
there
grew
thousands
of
sweetest
flowers
and
every
kind
of
health
giving
herb
and
tender
grass
for
the
deer
up
and
up
they
climbed
until
the
dark
forests
gave
place
to
stunted
shrubs
and
the
shrubs
to
barren
rocks
then
the
pathway
led
downward
again
to
the
head
of
a
narrow
glen
where
roared
a
foaming
waterfall
there
they
came
to
the
mouth
of
a
cave
opening
out
upon
a
sunny
ledge
and
almost
hidden
behind
a
broad
curtain
of
blossoming
vines
from
within
the
cave
there
came
the
sound
of
music
the
sweet
tones
of
a
harp
mingled
with
the
voices
of
singers
of
what
did
they
sing
they
sang
of
things
pure
and
good
and
beautiful
of
the
mighty
sea
and
the
earth
and
the
blue
vault
of
heaven
of
faith
strong
and
holy
of
hope
bright
and
trustful
of
love
pure
and
mighty
then
the
singing
ceased
and
the
harp
was
laid
aside
odysseus
and
the
bard
went
quickly
forward
and
stood
waiting
beside
the
door
they
could
see
by
looking
in
that
the
low
walls
of
the
cave
were
adorned
with
shields
of
leather
or
bronze
with
the
antlers
of
deer
and
with
many
other
relics
of
battle
or
of
the
chase
upon
the
smooth
white
floor
were
soft
couches
of
bearskins
and
upon
the
hearthstone
in
the
centre
blazed
a
bright
fire
of
twigs
casting
a
ruddy
flickering
light
into
the
farthest
nook
and
cranny
of
that
strange
room
they
had
not
long
to
wait
at
the
door
an
old
man
with
white
hair
and
beard
reaching
to
his
waist
with
eyes
as
clear
and
bright
as
those
of
a
falcon
and
with
a
step
as
firm
as
that
of
youth
came
quickly
forward
to
greet
them
odysseus
thought
that
he
had
never
seen
a
man
with
so
noble
and
yet
so
sad
a
mien
hail
strangers
said
the
aged
hero
taking
their
hands
hail
son
of
laertes
for
i
know
thee
welcome
to
the
home
of
cheiron
the
last
of
his
race
come
in
and
you
shall
be
kindly
entertained
and
after
you
have
rested
your
weary
limbs
you
shall
tell
me
why
you
have
come
to
pelion
and
what
favor
you
have
to
ask
of
me
therewith
he
turned
again
into
the
broad
and
odysseus
and
his
tutor
followed
him
and
he
led
his
guests
and
seated
them
on
pleasant
couches
not
far
from
the
glowing
fire
upon
the
hearth
then
a
comely
youth
brought
water
in
a
stone
pitcher
and
poured
it
in
a
basin
that
they
might
wash
their
hands
and
another
lad
brought
wheaten
bread
and
set
it
by
them
on
a
polished
table
and
another
brought
golden
honey
in
the
honeycomb
and
many
other
dainties
and
laid
them
on
the
board
and
when
they
were
ready
a
fourth
lad
lifted
and
placed
before
them
a
platter
of
venison
and
cups
full
of
water
from
the
mountain
cataract
while
they
sat
partaking
of
these
bounties
not
a
word
was
spoken
in
the
cave
for
old
cheiron
never
forgot
the
courtesy
due
to
guests
and
strangers
when
they
had
finished
he
bade
them
stay
a
while
upon
the
couches
where
they
sat
and
he
took
a
golden
lyre
in
his
hands
and
deftly
touched
the
chords
bringing
forth
the
most
restful
music
that
odysseus
had
ever
heard
he
played
a
soft
low
melody
which
seemed
to
carry
their
minds
far
away
into
a
summer
land
of
peace
where
they
wandered
at
will
by
the
side
of
still
waters
and
through
sunlit
fields
and
groves
and
reposed
under
the
shelter
of
calm
blue
skies
shielded
by
the
boundless
love
of
the
unknown
creator
when
he
had
finished
odysseus
thought
no
more
of
the
toilsome
journey
from
iolcos
or
of
the
wearisome
climbing
of
the
mountain
he
thought
only
of
the
wise
and
wonderful
old
man
who
sat
before
him
now
tell
me
said
cheiron
laying
his
lyre
aside
tell
me
what
errand
brings
you
hither
and
what
i
can
do
to
aid
you
we
have
no
errand
answered
phemius
save
to
see
one
of
the
immortals
and
to
listen
to
the
words
of
wisdom
and
beauty
which
fall
from
his
lips
we
know
that
you
have
been
the
friend
and
teacher
of
heroes
such
as
have
not
had
their
peers
on
earth
and
this
lad
odysseus
who
is
himself
the
son
of
a
hero
would
fain
learn
something
from
you
cheiron
smiled
and
looked
full
into
the
young
lad
s
face
i
have
trained
many
such
youths
as
you
for
the
battle
of
life
he
said
and
your
father
as
were
all
the
argonauts
was
well
known
to
me
you
are
welcome
to
mount
pelion
and
to
old
cheiron
s
school
but
why
do
you
look
at
my
feet
odysseus
blushed
but
could
make
no
answer
i
understand
it
said
cheiron
speaking
in
a
tone
of
sadness
you
expected
to
find
me
half
man
half
horse
and
you
were
looking
for
the
hoofs
for
thus
have
many
men
thought
concerning
me
and
my
race
long
time
ago
my
people
dwelt
in
the
valleys
and
upon
the
plains
of
thessaly
and
they
were
the
first
who
tamed
the
wild
horses
of
the
desert
flats
and
taught
them
to
obey
the
hand
of
their
riders
for
untold
years
my
fathers
held
this
land
and
they
were
as
free
as
the
winds
that
play
upon
the
top
of
pelion
their
warriors
galloping
on
their
swift
horses
with
their
long
lances
ready
in
their
hands
knew
no
fear
nor
met
any
foe
that
could
stand
against
them
and
hence
men
called
them
centaurs
the
piercers
of
the
air
but
by
and
by
there
came
a
strong
people
from
beyond
the
sea
who
built
houses
of
stone
and
lived
in
towns
and
these
made
cruel
war
upon
the
centaurs
they
were
the
lapiths
the
and
they
had
never
seen
or
heard
of
horses
and
for
a
long
time
they
fancied
that
our
warriors
were
monsters
living
wild
among
the
mountains
and
upon
the
plain
and
so
the
story
has
gone
abroad
throughout
the
world
that
all
the
centaurs
and
even
i
the
last
of
the
race
are
hardly
human
but
have
hoofs
and
manes
and
live
as
horses
live
from
greek
kentein
ten
auran
from
greek
laas
peithein
long
and
sad
was
the
war
between
the
centaurs
and
the
lapiths
but
the
were
stronger
than
the
piercers
of
the
air
in
time
my
people
were
driven
into
the
mountains
where
they
lived
as
wild
men
in
the
caves
and
in
the
sunless
gorges
and
ravines
and
our
enemies
the
lapiths
abode
in
the
rich
valleys
and
held
the
broad
which
had
once
been
ours
then
it
chanced
that
peirithous
king
of
the
lapiths
saw
hippodameia
fairest
of
our
mountain
maidens
and
wished
to
wed
her
whether
her
father
consented
to
the
marriage
or
whether
the
lapiths
carried
her
away
by
force
i
can
not
tell
but
peirithous
made
a
great
wedding
feast
and
to
it
he
invited
the
chiefs
of
the
centaurs
and
great
theseus
of
athens
and
nestor
of
sandy
pylos
and
many
others
of
the
noblest
heroes
of
hellas
many
wild
and
dark
stories
have
been
told
of
what
happened
at
that
wedding
feast
but
you
must
remember
that
all
these
stories
have
come
from
the
mouths
of
our
enemies
the
lapiths
and
that
their
truth
may
well
be
doubted
let
me
tell
you
about
it
as
i
understand
the
facts
to
be
in
the
midst
of
the
feast
when
the
lapiths
were
drunken
with
wine
eurytion
the
boldest
of
the
centaurs
rose
quickly
to
his
feet
and
beckoned
to
his
fellows
without
a
word
they
seized
upon
the
bride
they
carried
her
not
unwilling
from
the
hall
they
seated
her
upon
a
swift
steed
which
stood
ready
at
the
door
then
in
hot
haste
they
mounted
aiming
to
ride
with
their
prize
back
to
their
mountain
homes
but
the
lapiths
were
aroused
and
rushed
from
the
hall
ere
our
horsemen
were
outside
of
the
gates
fearful
was
the
struggle
which
followed
our
men
were
armed
with
pine
clubs
only
which
they
had
hidden
beneath
their
cloaks
for
they
dared
not
bring
weapons
to
the
wedding
feast
the
lapiths
fought
with
spears
and
with
pitiless
hate
they
slew
one
after
another
of
the
centaurs
until
hardly
a
single
man
escaped
to
the
mountains
but
the
war
ended
not
with
that
for
peirithous
burning
with
anger
drove
the
remnant
of
my
people
out
of
their
mountain
homes
and
forced
them
to
flee
far
away
to
the
lonely
land
of
pindus
and
i
alone
of
all
my
race
was
left
in
my
on
the
wooded
slopes
of
pelion
when
cheiron
had
ended
his
story
odysseus
saw
that
his
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
and
that
his
hand
trembled
as
he
reached
again
for
his
lyre
and
played
a
short
sad
melody
as
mournful
as
a
funeral
song
why
did
you
not
go
with
your
kindred
to
the
land
of
pindus
asked
phemius
this
is
my
home
answered
cheiron
the
fair
valley
which
you
see
yonder
was
once
my
father
s
pasture
land
all
the
country
that
lies
before
us
even
to
the
meeting
of
the
earth
and
the
sky
is
the
country
of
my
forefathers
i
have
neither
parents
nor
brothers
nor
wife
nor
children
why
should
i
wish
to
go
away
from
all
that
is
dear
to
me
this
is
a
pleasant
place
and
the
young
boys
who
have
been
my
pupils
have
made
my
life
very
happy
please
tell
us
about
your
pupils
said
odysseus
moving
nearer
to
the
wise
old
man
so
many
boys
have
been
under
my
care
said
cheiron
that
i
could
not
tell
you
about
them
all
some
have
come
and
been
taught
and
gone
back
to
their
homes
and
the
world
has
never
heard
of
them
because
their
lots
have
been
cast
in
pleasant
places
and
their
lives
have
been
spent
in
peace
there
have
been
others
who
have
made
their
names
famous
upon
the
earth
for
their
paths
were
beset
with
difficulties
and
before
them
loomed
great
mountains
which
they
must
needs
remove
or
be
crushed
by
them
among
these
latter
were
heracles
doomed
to
a
life
of
labor
because
another
had
usurped
the
place
which
he
should
have
had
young
jason
hiding
from
the
cruel
hatred
of
his
uncle
pelias
and
gentle
asclepius
bereft
of
a
mother
s
love
and
cast
friendless
upon
the
world
s
cold
mercies
and
there
were
also
peleus
my
grandson
who
is
now
your
host
at
iolcos
and
actæon
the
famous
hunter
and
many
of
the
heroes
who
afterward
sailed
on
the
argo
to
the
golden
strand
of
colchis
each
of
these
lads
had
a
mind
of
his
own
and
tastes
which
it
was
for
me
to
foster
and
to
train
heracles
was
headstrong
selfish
impulsive
terrible
when
he
did
not
bridle
his
passions
and
yet
his
great
heart
was
full
of
love
for
the
poor
the
weak
and
the
and
he
studied
to
make
plans
for
lightening
their
burdens
jason
loved
the
water
and
wrapped
in
his
cloak
he
would
sit
for
hours
on
pelion
s
top
and
gaze
with
longing
eyes
upon
the
purple
sea
asclepius
delighted
to
wander
among
the
crags
and
in
the
ravines
it
pelion
gathering
herbs
and
flowers
and
studying
the
habits
of
birds
and
beasts
and
actæon
had
a
passion
for
the
woods
and
the
fields
and
had
ever
a
pack
of
swift
hounds
at
his
heels
ready
for
the
chase
of
wild
boar
or
mountain
deer
when
these
lads
came
to
me
i
saw
that
i
must
give
to
each
the
food
which
was
best
fitted
for
his
needs
and
which
his
mind
most
craved
had
i
dealt
with
all
alike
and
taught
all
the
same
lessons
i
doubt
if
any
would
have
grown
to
manhood
s
full
estate
but
while
i
curbed
the
headstrong
will
of
heracles
i
did
what
i
could
to
foster
his
love
of
virtue
and
his
inventive
genius
i
taught
young
jason
all
that
i
knew
about
this
wonderful
earth
and
the
seas
and
islands
which
lie
around
it
i
led
asclepius
farther
along
the
pathway
which
he
had
chosen
and
showed
him
the
virtues
that
were
hidden
in
plants
and
flowers
i
went
with
actæon
upon
the
chase
and
taught
him
that
there
is
no
sport
in
cruelty
and
that
the
life
of
the
weakest
creature
should
not
be
taken
without
good
cause
thus
i
moulded
the
mind
of
each
of
the
lads
according
to
its
bent
and
each
one
grew
in
stature
and
in
strength
and
in
beauty
before
my
eyes
and
then
there
were
general
lessons
which
i
gave
to
them
all
leading
them
to
the
knowledge
of
those
things
which
are
necessary
to
the
and
perfect
man
of
our
day
i
taught
them
how
to
wield
the
weapons
of
warfare
and
of
the
chase
how
to
ride
and
to
swim
and
how
to
bear
fatigue
without
murmuring
and
face
danger
without
fear
and
i
showed
them
how
to
take
care
of
their
own
bodies
so
that
they
might
be
strong
and
graceful
and
full
of
health
and
vigor
and
i
taught
them
how
to
heal
diseases
and
how
to
treat
wounds
and
how
to
nurse
the
sick
and
more
than
all
else
i
taught
them
to
reverence
and
love
that
great
power
so
little
understood
by
us
but
whom
mankind
will
some
day
learn
to
know
it
was
not
long
till
heracles
went
out
in
his
might
to
rid
the
world
of
monsters
to
defend
the
innocent
and
the
helpless
and
to
set
right
that
which
is
wrong
and
for
aught
i
know
he
is
toiling
still
along
the
straight
road
of
virtue
towards
the
blue
mountains
of
fame
and
jason
as
you
know
left
me
and
went
down
to
iolcos
to
claim
his
birthright
of
old
pelias
and
being
bidden
to
bring
the
golden
fleece
to
hellas
he
built
the
argo
and
sailed
with
the
heroes
to
colchis
it
was
a
proud
day
for
me
his
old
teacher
when
he
came
back
to
iolcos
with
the
glittering
treasure
and
i
trusted
that
a
life
of
happiness
and
glory
was
before
him
but
alas
he
had
forgotten
my
teaching
and
had
joined
himself
to
evil
and
medea
the
witch
whom
he
loved
brought
untold
misery
upon
his
head
and
drove
him
ere
long
to
an
untimely
death
then
asclepius
went
out
upon
his
mission
and
everywhere
that
he
went
he
healed
and
purified
and
raised
and
blessed
he
was
the
greatest
conqueror
among
all
my
pupils
but
he
won
not
by
strength
like
heracles
nor
by
guile
like
jason
but
through
gentleness
and
sympathy
and
brotherly
love
and
by
knowledge
and
skill
and
patient
and
to
him
men
gave
the
highest
honor
because
he
cured
while
others
killed
but
the
powers
of
darkness
are
ever
hateful
towards
the
good
and
hades
when
he
saw
that
asclepius
snatched
back
to
life
even
those
who
were
at
death
s
door
complained
that
the
great
healer
was
robbing
his
kingdom
and
men
say
that
zeus
hearkened
to
this
complaint
and
that
he
smote
asclepius
with
his
thunderbolts
then
the
face
of
the
sun
was
veiled
in
sorrow
and
men
and
beasts
and
all
creatures
upon
the
earth
wept
for
great
grief
and
the
trees
dropped
their
leaves
to
the
ground
and
the
flowers
closed
their
petals
and
withered
upon
their
stalks
because
the
gentle
physician
who
had
cured
all
pains
and
sickness
was
no
longer
in
the
land
of
the
living
and
the
wrath
of
apollo
was
stirred
within
him
and
he
went
down
to
the
great
smithy
of
hephaestus
and
with
his
swift
arrows
slew
the
cyclopes
who
had
forged
the
thunderbolts
for
zeus
and
spared
not
one
then
zeus
in
his
turn
was
filled
with
anger
and
he
sent
the
apollo
to
pherae
in
thessaly
to
serve
for
a
whole
year
as
bondsman
to
king
admetus
see
note
at
the
end
of
this
volume
at
this
moment
a
tall
and
very
handsome
lad
whom
odysseus
had
not
yet
seen
came
into
the
room
he
was
not
more
than
six
years
old
his
long
amber
hair
fell
in
waves
upon
his
shoulders
his
eyes
twinkled
and
flashed
like
the
sunlight
on
the
blue
sea
waves
he
held
his
head
erect
and
he
walked
with
a
noble
grace
which
betokened
the
proud
soul
within
his
breast
the
eyes
of
odysseus
were
fixed
upon
him
and
he
wondered
who
this
noble
human
being
could
be
cheiron
saw
his
questioning
look
and
called
the
young
lad
to
him
odysseus
said
he
this
is
my
young
achilles
the
son
of
king
peleus
your
host
something
tells
me
that
your
life
and
his
will
in
be
strangely
mingled
whether
as
friends
or
as
foes
i
can
not
tell
you
shall
be
friends
at
least
and
after
a
while
you
shall
go
out
together
and
try
your
skill
at
archery
but
achilles
you
may
go
now
and
play
with
your
fellows
i
have
something
more
to
say
to
young
odysseus
the
lad
turned
and
left
the
room
as
gracefully
as
he
had
entered
then
cheiron
turned
again
to
odysseus
and
the
bard
i
was
telling
you
about
my
pupils
he
said
and
i
will
speak
of
but
one
other
for
there
are
reasons
why
you
should
know
his
history
peleus
the
son
of
æacus
and
my
loved
daughter
endeis
was
brought
to
me
by
his
mother
from
ægina
there
was
something
in
the
boy
s
face
which
showed
that
a
strange
sad
life
was
to
be
his
and
although
he
was
not
a
promising
lad
yet
when
he
left
me
to
go
with
jason
to
colchis
i
felt
great
grief
at
losing
him
but
by
and
by
after
the
heroes
had
returned
i
heard
that
peleus
had
done
many
wicked
things
in
ægina
and
that
he
had
been
driven
into
exile
for
his
crimes
he
went
first
to
ceyx
in
thessaly
a
lonely
wanderer
cast
off
and
forsaken
by
all
his
friends
and
a
story
is
told
that
in
his
loneliness
and
his
sorrow
he
one
day
prayed
to
zeus
that
he
would
give
him
companions
and
zeus
heard
his
prayer
and
great
armies
of
ants
were
changed
at
once
into
men
and
they
did
homage
to
peleus
and
became
his
subjects
and
hence
he
is
still
called
the
king
of
the
myrmidons
then
he
went
to
phthia
where
eurytion
reigned
and
eurytion
purified
him
from
his
crimes
and
gave
him
his
daughter
antigone
in
wedlock
and
with
her
the
third
of
his
kingdom
but
in
an
evil
day
they
hunted
the
wild
boar
together
in
the
woods
of
calydon
and
peleus
unwittingly
slew
his
friend
with
an
arrow
then
he
fled
from
the
people
of
phthia
and
came
to
iolcos
where
acastus
the
son
of
old
pelias
ruled
and
acastus
welcomed
him
kindly
and
purified
him
from
the
stain
of
eurytion
s
death
and
gave
him
of
the
best
of
all
that
he
had
and
entertained
him
for
a
long
time
as
his
guest
but
astydamia
the
wife
of
king
acastus
falsely
accused
peleus
of
another
crime
and
besought
her
husband
to
slay
him
then
the
heart
of
acastus
was
sad
for
he
would
not
shed
the
blood
of
one
who
was
his
guest
but
he
persuaded
peleus
to
join
him
in
hunting
wild
beasts
in
the
woods
of
pelion
for
he
hoped
that
then
some
way
might
open
for
him
to
rid
himself
of
the
unfortunate
man
all
day
long
they
toiled
up
and
down
the
slopes
they
climbed
the
steep
cliffs
they
forced
their
way
through
brakes
and
briery
thickets
and
at
last
peleus
was
so
overwearied
that
he
sank
down
on
a
bed
of
moss
and
fell
asleep
then
acastus
slyly
took
his
weapons
from
him
and
left
him
there
alone
and
unarmed
hoping
that
the
wild
beasts
would
find
and
slay
him
when
peleus
awoke
he
saw
himself
surrounded
by
mountain
robbers
he
felt
for
his
sword
but
it
was
gone
even
his
shield
was
nowhere
to
be
found
he
called
aloud
to
acastus
but
the
king
was
dining
at
that
moment
in
iolcos
i
heard
his
cry
however
i
knew
his
voice
and
i
hastened
to
his
aid
the
robbers
fled
when
they
saw
me
coming
and
i
led
my
dear
but
erring
grandson
back
to
my
cavern
where
the
days
of
his
boyhood
and
innocence
had
been
spent
but
i
see
that
the
sun
is
sinking
in
the
west
i
will
say
no
more
until
after
we
have
partaken
of
food
with
these
words
cheiron
arose
and
left
the
room
odysseus
anxious
to
become
acquainted
with
the
lads
arose
also
and
walked
out
into
the
open
air
achilles
was
waiting
for
him
just
outside
the
door
and
the
two
boys
were
soon
talking
with
each
other
as
if
they
had
long
been
friends
viii
golden
apple
after
the
evening
meal
had
been
eaten
and
the
set
in
order
the
lads
brought
armloads
of
dry
sticks
and
twigs
and
threw
them
upon
the
fire
and
the
flame
leaped
up
and
shone
upon
all
around
with
a
ruddy
glow
and
the
great
cavern
was
emptied
of
gloom
and
was
so
filled
with
light
and
warmth
that
it
seemed
a
fit
place
for
joy
and
pleasure
old
cheiron
sat
upon
his
high
couch
like
a
king
upon
his
throne
and
the
five
comely
lads
with
odysseus
sat
before
him
while
phemius
the
bard
stood
leaning
against
the
wall
after
cheiron
had
played
a
brief
melody
upon
his
harp
and
the
boys
had
sung
a
pleasant
song
the
wise
old
master
thus
began
there
is
a
cavern
somewhere
on
mount
pelion
larger
by
far
and
a
thousand
times
more
beautiful
than
this
but
its
doorway
is
hidden
to
mortals
and
but
few
men
have
ever
stood
beneath
its
vaulted
roof
in
that
cavern
the
ones
who
oversee
the
affairs
of
men
once
held
high
carnival
for
they
had
met
there
at
the
marriage
feast
of
king
peleus
and
the
woods
and
rocks
of
mighty
pelion
echoed
with
the
sound
of
their
merry
making
but
wherefore
should
the
marriage
feast
of
a
mortal
be
held
in
such
a
place
and
with
guests
so
noble
and
so
great
i
will
tell
you
after
peleus
had
escaped
from
the
plot
which
king
acastus
had
laid
for
him
he
dwelt
long
time
with
me
for
he
feared
to
go
down
upon
the
plain
lest
the
men
of
iolcos
should
seize
him
by
order
of
acastus
or
the
folk
of
phthia
should
kill
him
in
revenge
for
old
eurytion
s
death
but
the
days
seemed
long
to
him
thus
shut
out
from
fellowship
with
men
and
the
sun
seemed
to
move
slowly
in
the
heavens
and
often
he
would
walk
around
to
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
and
sitting
upon
a
great
rock
he
would
gaze
for
long
hours
upon
the
purple
waters
of
the
sea
one
morning
as
thus
he
sat
he
saw
the
sea
nymph
thetis
come
up
out
of
the
waves
and
walk
upon
the
shore
beneath
him
fairer
than
a
dream
was
she
more
beautiful
than
any
picture
of
nymph
or
goddess
she
was
clad
in
a
robe
of
silk
woven
by
the
naiads
in
their
watery
grottos
and
there
was
a
chaplet
of
pearls
upon
her
head
and
sandals
of
sparkling
silver
were
upon
her
feet
as
peleus
gazed
upon
this
lovely
creature
he
heard
a
voice
whispering
in
his
ear
it
was
the
voice
of
pallas
athené
illustration
the
thetis
rising
from
the
waves
most
luckless
of
mortal
men
she
said
there
is
recompense
in
store
for
those
who
repent
of
their
and
who
leaving
the
paths
of
error
turn
again
to
the
road
of
virtue
the
immortals
have
seen
thy
sorrow
for
the
evil
deeds
of
thy
youth
and
they
have
looked
with
pity
upon
thee
in
thy
misfortunes
and
now
thy
days
of
exile
and
of
sore
punishment
are
drawing
to
an
end
behold
the
thetis
most
beautiful
of
the
nymphs
of
the
sea
whom
even
the
immortals
have
wooed
in
vain
she
has
been
sent
to
this
shore
to
be
won
and
wedded
by
peleus
looked
up
to
see
the
speaker
of
these
words
but
he
beheld
only
a
blue
cloud
resting
above
the
he
turned
his
eyes
downward
again
and
to
his
grief
the
thetis
had
vanished
in
the
waves
all
day
he
sat
and
waited
for
her
return
but
she
came
not
when
darkness
began
to
fall
he
sought
me
in
my
and
told
me
what
he
had
seen
and
heard
and
i
taught
him
how
to
win
the
sea
nymph
for
his
bride
so
when
the
sun
again
gilded
the
crags
of
pelion
brave
peleus
hid
himself
among
the
rocks
close
by
the
shore
and
waited
for
the
coming
of
the
lady
of
the
sea
in
a
little
time
she
rose
beautiful
as
the
star
of
morning
from
the
waves
she
sat
down
upon
the
beach
and
dallied
with
her
golden
tresses
and
sang
sweet
songs
of
a
happy
land
in
the
depths
of
the
sounding
sea
peleus
bearing
in
mind
what
i
had
taught
him
arose
from
his
and
caught
the
beauteous
creature
in
his
arms
in
vain
did
she
struggle
to
leap
into
the
waves
seven
times
she
changed
her
form
as
he
held
her
by
turns
she
changed
into
a
fountain
of
water
into
a
cloud
of
mist
into
a
burning
flame
and
into
a
senseless
rock
but
peleus
held
her
fast
and
she
changed
then
into
a
tawny
lion
and
then
into
a
tall
tree
and
lastly
she
took
her
own
matchless
form
again
and
peleus
held
the
lovely
thetis
by
the
hand
and
they
walked
long
time
together
upon
the
beach
while
the
birds
sang
among
the
leafy
trees
on
pelion
s
slopes
and
the
dolphins
sported
in
the
sparkling
waters
at
their
feet
and
peleus
wooed
the
lady
and
won
her
love
and
she
promised
to
be
his
bride
then
the
immortals
were
glad
and
they
fitted
up
the
great
cavern
on
mount
pelion
for
a
banquet
hall
and
made
therein
a
wedding
feast
such
as
was
never
seen
before
the
vaulted
roof
of
the
cavern
was
decked
with
gems
which
shone
like
the
stars
of
heaven
a
thousand
torches
held
by
lovely
mountain
nymphs
flamed
from
the
niches
in
the
high
walls
and
upon
the
floor
of
polished
marble
tables
for
ten
thousand
guests
were
ranged
when
the
wedding
feast
was
ready
all
those
who
live
on
high
olympus
and
all
the
immortals
who
dwell
upon
the
earth
came
to
rejoice
with
king
peleus
and
his
matchless
bride
and
they
brought
rich
presents
for
the
bridegroom
such
as
were
never
given
to
another
man
they
gave
him
a
suit
of
armor
rich
and
fair
a
wonder
to
behold
which
lame
hephaestus
with
rare
skill
had
wrought
and
fashioned
poseidon
bestowed
on
him
the
deathless
horses
balios
and
xanthos
and
a
chariot
with
trimmings
of
gold
and
i
one
of
the
least
of
the
guests
gave
him
an
ashen
spear
which
i
had
cut
on
pelion
s
top
and
fashioned
with
my
own
hands
at
the
table
sat
zeus
the
father
of
gods
and
men
and
his
wife
the
here
and
aphrodite
and
pallas
athené
and
all
the
wisest
and
the
fairest
of
the
immortals
the
nereides
nymphs
of
the
sea
danced
in
honor
of
thetis
their
sister
and
the
muses
sang
their
sweetest
songs
and
apollo
played
upon
the
lyre
the
fates
too
were
there
sad
clotho
twirling
her
spindle
unloving
lachesis
with
wrinkled
lips
ready
to
speak
the
fatal
word
and
pitiless
atropos
holding
in
her
hand
the
unsparing
shears
and
around
the
table
passed
the
youthful
and
hebe
pouring
out
rich
draughts
of
nectar
for
the
guests
yet
there
was
one
among
all
the
immortals
who
had
not
been
invited
to
the
wedding
it
was
eris
the
daughter
of
war
and
hate
her
scowling
features
and
her
hot
and
hasty
manners
were
to
grace
a
feast
where
all
should
be
mirth
and
gladness
yet
in
her
evil
heart
she
planned
to
be
avenged
for
the
slight
which
had
been
put
upon
her
while
the
was
at
its
height
and
the
company
were
listening
to
the
music
from
apollo
s
lyre
she
came
unseen
into
the
hall
and
threw
a
golden
apple
upon
the
table
no
one
knew
whence
the
apple
came
but
on
it
were
written
these
words
for
the
to
whom
does
it
belong
asked
zeus
stroking
his
brows
in
sad
perplexity
the
music
ceased
and
mirth
and
jollity
fled
at
once
from
the
banquet
the
torches
which
lit
up
the
scene
flickered
and
smoked
the
lustre
of
the
gems
in
the
vaulted
roof
was
dimmed
dark
clouds
canopied
the
great
hall
for
discord
had
taken
her
place
at
the
table
uninvited
and
unwelcome
though
she
was
the
apple
belongs
to
me
said
here
trying
to
snatch
it
for
i
am
the
queen
and
gods
and
men
honor
me
as
having
no
peer
on
not
so
cried
aphrodite
with
me
dwell
love
and
joy
and
not
only
do
gods
and
men
sing
my
praises
but
all
nature
rejoices
in
my
presence
the
apple
is
mine
and
i
will
have
it
then
athené
joined
in
the
quarrel
what
is
it
to
be
a
queen
said
she
if
at
the
same
time
one
lacks
that
good
temper
which
sweetens
life
what
is
it
to
have
a
handsome
form
and
face
while
the
mind
is
uncouth
and
beauty
of
mind
is
better
than
beauty
of
face
for
the
former
is
immortal
while
the
latter
fades
and
dies
hence
no
one
has
a
better
right
than
i
to
be
called
the
then
the
strife
spread
among
the
guests
in
the
hall
each
taking
sides
with
the
goddess
that
he
loved
best
and
where
peace
and
merriment
had
reigned
now
hot
words
and
bitter
wrangling
were
heard
and
had
not
zeus
bidden
them
keep
silence
thus
putting
an
end
to
the
quarrel
all
pelion
would
have
been
rent
and
the
earth
shaken
to
its
centre
in
the
mêlée
that
would
have
followed
let
us
waste
no
words
over
this
matter
he
said
it
is
not
for
the
immortals
to
say
who
of
their
number
is
most
beautiful
but
on
the
slopes
of
mount
ida
far
across
the
sea
the
fairest
of
the
sons
of
men
paris
the
son
of
trojan
priam
keeps
his
flocks
let
him
judge
who
is
fairest
and
let
the
apple
be
hers
to
whom
he
gives
then
hermes
the
messenger
arose
and
led
the
three
goddesses
over
sea
and
land
to
distant
ida
where
paris
with
no
thought
of
the
wonderful
life
which
lay
before
him
piped
on
his
shepherd
s
reeds
and
tended
his
flock
of
sheep
here
cheiron
paused
in
his
story
and
the
five
lads
who
had
heard
it
oftentimes
before
bade
him
a
kind
and
withdrew
into
an
inner
chamber
to
pass
the
hours
in
sleep
when
more
wood
had
been
thrown
upon
the
fire
and
the
flames
leaped
up
high
and
bright
towards
the
roof
of
the
cave
odysseus
and
phemius
sat
down
again
before
the
wise
old
master
and
asked
him
to
finish
the
tale
which
he
had
begun
but
first
tell
us
said
odysseus
about
that
paris
who
was
to
award
the
golden
apple
to
the
one
whom
he
should
deem
the
fairest
then
cheiron
smiled
and
went
on
thus
with
his
story
on
the
other
side
of
the
sea
there
stands
a
city
rich
and
mighty
the
like
of
which
there
is
none
in
hellas
there
an
old
man
named
priam
rules
over
a
happy
and
people
he
dwells
in
a
great
palace
of
polished
marble
on
a
hill
overlooking
the
plain
and
his
granaries
are
stored
with
corn
and
his
flocks
and
herds
are
pastured
on
the
hills
and
mountain
slopes
behind
the
city
many
sons
has
king
priam
and
they
are
brave
and
noble
youths
well
worthy
of
such
a
father
the
eldest
of
these
sons
is
hector
who
the
trojans
hope
will
live
to
bring
great
honor
to
his
native
land
just
before
the
second
son
was
born
a
strange
thing
troubled
the
family
of
old
priam
the
queen
had
dreamed
that
her
babe
had
turned
into
a
firebrand
which
burned
up
the
walls
and
the
high
towers
of
troy
and
left
but
smouldering
ashes
where
once
the
proud
city
stood
she
told
the
king
her
dream
and
when
the
child
was
born
they
called
a
soothsayer
who
could
foresee
the
mysteries
of
the
future
and
they
asked
him
what
the
vision
meant
it
means
said
he
that
this
babe
if
he
lives
shall
be
a
firebrand
in
troy
and
shall
turn
its
walls
and
its
high
towers
into
heaps
of
smouldering
ashes
but
what
shall
be
done
with
the
child
that
he
may
not
do
this
terrible
thing
asked
priam
greatly
sorrowing
for
the
babe
was
very
beautiful
do
not
suffer
that
he
shall
live
answered
the
soothsayer
but
priam
the
gentlest
and
most
of
men
could
not
bear
to
harm
the
babe
so
he
called
archelaus
his
master
shepherd
and
bade
him
take
the
helpless
child
into
the
thick
woods
which
grow
high
up
on
the
slopes
of
ida
and
there
to
leave
him
alone
the
wild
beasts
that
roam
among
those
woods
he
thought
would
doubtless
find
him
or
in
any
case
he
could
not
live
long
without
care
and
nourishment
and
thus
the
dangerous
brand
would
be
quenched
while
yet
it
was
scarcely
a
spark
the
shepherd
did
as
he
was
bidden
although
it
cost
his
heart
many
a
sharp
pang
thus
to
deal
barbarously
with
the
innocent
he
laid
the
smiling
infant
wrapped
in
its
broidered
tunic
close
by
the
foot
of
an
oak
and
then
hurried
away
that
he
might
not
hear
its
cries
but
the
dryads
who
haunt
the
woods
and
groves
saw
the
babe
and
pitied
its
helplessness
and
cared
for
it
so
that
it
did
not
die
some
brought
it
yellow
honey
from
the
stores
of
the
wild
bees
some
fed
it
with
milk
from
the
white
goats
that
pastured
on
the
mountainside
and
others
stood
as
sentinels
around
it
guarding
it
from
the
wolves
and
bears
thus
five
days
passed
and
archelaus
the
shepherd
who
could
not
forget
the
babe
came
cautiously
to
the
spot
to
see
if
mayhap
even
its
broidered
cloak
had
been
spared
by
the
beasts
sorrowful
and
shuddering
he
glanced
toward
the
foot
of
the
tree
to
his
surprise
the
babe
was
still
there
it
looked
up
and
smiled
and
stretched
its
fat
hands
toward
him
the
shepherd
s
heart
would
not
let
him
turn
away
the
second
time
he
took
the
child
in
his
arms
and
carried
it
to
his
own
humble
home
in
the
valley
where
he
cared
for
it
and
brought
it
up
as
his
own
son
the
boy
grew
to
be
very
tall
and
very
handsome
and
he
was
so
brave
and
so
helpful
to
the
shepherds
around
mount
ida
that
they
called
him
alexandras
or
the
helper
of
men
but
his
named
him
paris
and
as
he
tended
his
sheep
in
the
mountain
dells
he
met
oenone
the
fairest
of
the
guileless
and
pure
as
the
waters
of
the
stream
by
whose
banks
she
loved
to
wander
day
after
day
he
sat
with
her
in
the
shadow
of
her
woodland
home
and
talked
of
innocence
and
beauty
and
of
a
life
of
sweet
contentment
and
of
love
and
the
maiden
listened
to
him
with
eyes
and
a
heart
full
of
trustfulness
and
faith
then
by
and
by
paris
and
oenone
were
wedded
and
their
little
cottage
in
the
mountain
glen
was
the
fairest
and
happiest
spot
in
ilios
the
days
sped
swiftly
by
and
neither
of
them
dreamed
that
any
sorrow
was
in
store
for
them
and
to
oenone
her
was
all
the
world
because
he
was
so
noble
and
brave
and
handsome
and
gentle
one
warm
summer
afternoon
paris
sat
in
the
shade
of
a
tree
at
the
foot
of
mount
ida
while
his
flocks
were
pasturing
upon
the
hillside
before
him
the
bees
were
humming
lazily
among
the
flowers
the
cicadas
were
chirping
among
the
leaves
above
his
head
and
now
and
then
a
bird
twittered
softly
among
the
bushes
behind
him
all
else
was
still
as
if
enjoying
to
the
full
the
delicious
calm
of
that
pleasant
day
paris
was
fashioning
a
slender
reed
into
a
shepherd
s
flute
while
oenone
sitting
in
the
deeper
shadows
of
some
clustering
vines
was
busy
with
some
simple
piece
of
a
sound
as
of
sweet
music
caused
the
young
shepherd
to
raise
his
eyes
before
him
stood
the
four
immortals
here
athené
aphrodite
and
hermes
the
messenger
their
faces
shone
with
a
dazzling
radiance
and
they
were
fairer
than
any
tongue
can
describe
at
their
feet
rare
flowers
sprang
up
crocuses
and
asphodels
and
white
lilies
and
the
air
was
filled
with
the
odor
of
orange
blossoms
paris
scarce
knowing
what
he
did
arose
to
greet
them
no
handsomer
youth
ever
stood
in
the
presence
of
beauty
straight
as
a
mountain
pine
was
he
a
leopard
skin
hung
carelessly
upon
his
shoulders
his
head
was
bare
but
his
locks
clustered
round
his
temples
in
sunny
curls
and
formed
fit
framework
for
his
fair
brows
then
hermes
spoke
first
paris
we
have
come
to
seek
thy
help
there
is
strife
among
the
folk
who
dwell
on
mount
olympus
here
are
here
athené
and
aphrodite
each
claiming
to
be
the
fairest
and
each
clamoring
for
this
prize
this
golden
apple
now
we
pray
that
you
will
judge
this
matter
and
give
the
apple
to
the
one
whom
you
may
deem
most
then
here
began
her
plea
at
once
i
know
that
i
am
the
fairest
she
said
for
i
am
queen
and
mine
it
is
to
rule
among
gods
and
men
give
me
the
prize
and
you
shall
have
wealth
and
a
kingdom
and
great
glory
and
men
in
shall
sing
your
and
paris
was
half
tempted
to
give
the
apple
without
further
ado
to
here
the
proud
queen
but
athené
spoke
there
is
that
fair
youth
which
is
better
than
riches
or
honor
or
great
glory
listen
to
me
and
i
will
give
thee
wisdom
and
a
pure
heart
and
thy
life
shall
be
crowned
with
peace
and
sweetened
with
love
and
made
strong
by
knowledge
and
though
men
may
not
sing
of
thee
in
thou
shalt
find
lasting
happiness
in
the
answer
of
a
good
conscience
towards
all
then
oenone
whispered
from
her
place
among
the
leaves
give
the
prize
to
athené
she
is
the
and
paris
would
have
placed
the
golden
apple
in
her
hand
had
not
aphrodite
stepped
quickly
forward
and
in
the
sweetest
merriest
tones
addressed
him
you
may
look
at
my
face
and
judge
for
yourself
as
to
whether
i
am
fair
said
she
laughing
and
tossing
her
curls
all
i
shall
say
is
this
give
me
the
prize
and
you
shall
have
for
your
wife
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
the
the
heart
of
oenone
stood
still
as
paris
placed
the
apple
in
aphrodite
s
hand
and
a
nameless
dread
came
over
her
as
if
the
earth
were
sinking
beneath
her
feet
but
the
next
moment
the
blood
came
back
to
her
cheeks
and
she
breathed
free
and
strong
again
for
she
heard
paris
say
i
have
a
wife
oenone
who
to
me
is
the
loveliest
of
mortals
and
i
care
not
for
your
offer
yet
i
give
to
you
the
apple
for
i
know
that
you
are
the
fairest
among
the
deathless
ones
who
live
on
high
on
the
very
next
day
it
happened
that
king
priam
sat
thoughtfully
in
his
palace
and
all
his
boys
and
girls
nearly
fifty
in
number
were
about
him
his
mind
turned
sadly
to
the
little
babe
whom
he
had
sent
away
many
years
ago
to
die
alone
on
wooded
ida
and
he
said
to
himself
the
child
has
been
long
dead
and
yet
no
feast
has
been
given
to
the
gods
that
they
may
make
his
little
spirit
glad
in
the
shadowy
land
of
hades
this
must
not
be
neglected
longer
within
three
days
a
feast
must
be
made
and
we
will
hold
games
in
his
then
he
called
his
servants
and
bade
them
go
to
the
pastures
on
mount
ida
and
choose
from
the
herds
that
were
there
the
fattest
and
handsomest
bull
to
be
given
as
a
prize
to
the
winner
in
the
games
and
he
proclaimed
through
all
ilios
that
on
the
third
day
there
would
be
a
great
feast
in
troy
and
games
would
be
held
in
honor
of
the
little
babe
who
had
died
twenty
years
before
now
when
the
servants
came
to
mount
ida
they
chose
a
bull
for
which
paris
had
long
cared
and
which
he
loved
more
than
any
other
and
he
would
not
let
the
beast
be
driven
from
the
pasture
until
it
was
agreed
that
he
might
go
to
the
city
with
it
and
contend
in
the
games
for
the
prize
but
oenone
the
river
nymph
wept
and
prayed
him
not
to
go
leave
not
the
pleasant
pasture
lands
of
ida
even
for
a
day
said
she
for
my
heart
tells
me
that
you
will
not
think
not
so
my
fair
one
said
paris
did
not
aphrodite
promise
that
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
the
world
shall
be
my
wife
and
who
is
more
beautiful
than
my
own
oenone
dry
now
your
tears
for
when
i
have
won
the
prizes
in
the
games
i
will
come
back
to
you
and
never
leave
you
then
the
grief
of
oenone
waxed
still
greater
if
you
will
go
she
cried
then
hear
my
warning
long
years
shall
pass
ere
you
shall
come
again
to
wooded
ida
and
the
hearts
which
now
are
young
shall
grow
old
and
feeble
by
reason
of
much
sorrow
cruel
war
and
many
dire
disasters
shall
overtake
you
and
death
shall
be
nigh
unto
you
and
then
oenone
although
long
forgotten
by
you
will
hasten
to
your
side
to
help
and
to
heal
and
to
forgive
that
so
the
old
love
may
live
again
farewell
but
paris
kissed
his
wife
and
hastened
light
of
heart
to
troy
how
could
it
be
otherwise
but
that
in
the
games
which
followed
the
handsome
young
shepherd
should
carry
off
all
the
prizes
who
are
you
asked
the
king
my
name
is
paris
answered
the
shepherd
and
i
feed
the
flocks
and
herds
on
wooded
then
hector
full
of
wrath
because
of
his
own
failure
to
win
a
prize
came
forward
to
dispute
with
paris
stand
there
hector
cried
old
priam
stand
close
to
the
young
shepherd
and
let
us
look
at
you
then
turning
to
the
queen
he
asked
did
you
ever
see
two
so
nearly
alike
the
shepherd
is
fairer
and
of
slighter
build
it
is
true
but
they
have
the
same
eye
the
same
frown
the
same
smile
the
same
motion
of
the
shoulders
the
same
walk
ah
what
if
the
young
babe
did
not
die
after
all
then
priam
s
daughter
cassandra
who
has
the
gift
of
prophecy
cried
out
oh
blind
of
eye
and
heart
that
you
can
not
see
in
this
young
shepherd
the
child
whom
you
sent
to
sleep
the
sleep
of
death
on
ida
s
wooded
slopes
and
so
it
came
about
that
paris
was
taken
into
his
father
s
house
and
given
the
place
of
honor
which
was
his
by
right
and
he
forgot
oenone
his
fair
young
wife
and
left
her
to
pine
in
loneliness
among
the
woods
and
in
the
narrow
dells
of
sunny
ida
see
note
at
the
end
of
this
volume
by
this
time
the
fire
had
burned
low
upon
the
hearth
and
cheiron
the
master
would
fain
have
ended
his
talk
but
odysseus
was
anxious
to
hear
more
said
he
we
must
go
back
to
iolcos
for
perchance
the
ships
of
peleus
may
then
be
ready
to
sail
so
tell
us
i
pray
you
yet
more
about
that
strange
wedding
feast
in
the
cavern
halls
of
pelion
there
is
little
more
to
tell
said
the
master
after
the
feast
king
peleus
went
down
with
his
bride
into
phthia
and
there
his
myrmidons
who
had
waited
so
long
for
his
coming
rallied
around
him
ready
to
help
him
in
any
undertaking
and
they
marched
upon
iolcos
and
entered
the
gates
carrying
all
before
them
and
they
slew
king
acastus
and
set
peleus
on
his
throne
thus
ended
this
hero
s
days
of
exile
and
now
for
seven
years
he
has
ruled
iolcos
and
phthia
both
wisely
and
well
yet
though
you
have
found
him
at
this
season
of
the
year
in
iolcos
he
loves
best
his
old
home
of
phthia
where
dwell
his
myrmidons
please
tell
me
about
his
son
fair
young
achilles
who
is
here
in
your
hall
said
odysseus
cheiron
answered
briefly
by
telling
him
how
the
young
lad
s
mother
the
sea
nymph
thetis
had
longed
to
make
her
son
immortal
and
how
it
was
said
that
she
each
night
threw
him
into
the
fire
to
purge
away
whatever
mortal
stains
might
cling
to
him
and
how
each
day
she
anointed
him
with
ambrosia
and
sang
him
to
sleep
with
sweet
lullabies
of
the
sea
but
one
night
added
cheiron
king
peleus
happened
to
see
the
babe
lying
in
the
fire
and
in
his
fright
he
cried
out
and
snatched
him
from
the
coals
then
thetis
sorrowfully
gave
up
her
plan
and
the
boy
was
sent
to
me
that
i
might
train
him
in
all
that
goes
to
the
making
of
a
man
there
are
those
who
say
that
i
feed
the
lad
on
the
hearts
of
lions
and
the
marrow
of
bears
and
wild
boars
and
those
may
believe
the
story
who
wish
to
do
so
but
i
have
lived
long
enough
to
know
that
there
are
other
and
better
ways
of
training
up
heroes
and
fitting
them
for
the
strife
of
battle
and
thus
the
long
talk
with
cheiron
the
wise
master
ended
and
odysseus
retired
to
his
couch
and
was
soon
dreaming
of
ithaca
and
of
his
anxious
mother
who
was
even
then
hoping
for
his
return
the
next
morning
the
lad
and
his
tutor
went
down
the
mountain
and
following
the
pathway
which
jason
had
taken
when
he
went
to
claim
his
birthright
of
pelias
they
came
in
good
time
back
to
iolcos
by
the
sea
there
they
found
that
a
ship
was
just
making
ready
to
sail
for
corinth
and
bidding
a
hasty
farewell
to
king
peleus
and
to
bold
echion
who
still
tarried
there
they
embarked
and
were
soon
well
on
their
way
the
voyage
was
a
long
and
hard
one
but
kind
athené
favored
them
and
poseidon
gave
them
smooth
waters
and
many
pleasant
days
upon
the
sea
nor
were
they
delayed
at
corinth
for
they
found
waiting
there
a
ship
which
laertes
had
sent
out
on
purpose
to
meet
them
and
bring
them
home
and
so
before
the
autumn
had
closed
odysseus
much
wiser
and
stronger
than
he
was
when
he
departed
gazed
with
glad
eyes
once
more
upon
the
shores
of
ithaca
ix
swineherd
when
odysseus
stepped
ashore
upon
the
sandy
beach
of
ithaca
the
good
people
of
the
town
both
young
and
old
had
gathered
there
to
welcome
him
and
they
sang
a
song
of
greeting
like
that
with
which
they
were
wont
to
meet
their
returning
heroes
he
staid
only
a
moment
to
speak
with
them
with
winged
feet
he
hastened
to
the
hall
where
his
queenly
mother
waited
for
his
coming
she
threw
her
arms
about
him
and
in
the
fulness
of
her
joy
wept
aloud
and
she
kissed
his
head
and
his
eyes
and
both
his
hands
and
welcomed
him
as
one
saved
from
death
thou
hast
come
at
last
odysseus
she
said
the
light
is
not
more
sweet
to
me
i
feared
that
i
should
never
see
thee
more
when
i
heard
that
thou
hadst
gone
from
parnassus
to
distant
pelion
come
now
and
sit
before
me
as
of
yore
and
let
me
look
into
those
eyes
which
have
been
so
long
time
away
and
laertes
too
folded
the
boy
in
his
arms
and
kissed
him
and
plied
him
with
a
thousand
questions
which
he
could
not
answer
then
in
the
halls
of
the
king
a
feast
was
made
ready
and
the
day
was
given
over
to
music
and
and
all
the
people
joined
in
offering
thanks
to
pallas
athené
who
had
brought
the
wanderer
safe
home
to
his
friends
and
his
kindred
when
the
evening
had
come
and
the
guests
had
gone
to
their
own
homes
odysseus
sat
upon
a
low
stool
at
his
mother
s
feet
while
she
asked
him
many
questions
about
her
aged
sire
autolycus
and
about
the
dear
home
of
her
girlhood
on
the
farther
side
of
mount
parnassus
and
he
told
her
of
all
that
she
asked
him
and
of
the
wonderful
things
that
he
had
seen
and
heard
in
lands
and
seas
but
were
you
not
afraid
that
evil
would
befall
you
and
that
your
eyes
would
never
more
behold
fair
ithaca
asked
his
mother
tenderly
stroking
his
yellow
hair
nightly
i
prayed
to
pallas
athené
answered
the
lad
and
she
watched
kindly
over
me
every
hour
who
would
be
afraid
when
shielded
and
led
by
so
great
a
friend
then
too
good
phemius
questioned
the
pythian
oracle
about
me
and
the
answer
was
such
as
to
make
me
sure
of
safety
it
was
this
to
home
and
kindred
he
shall
safe
return
ere
long
with
scars
and
greeted
with
triumphal
well
said
laertes
the
oracle
doubtless
spoke
the
truth
we
know
that
you
have
returned
to
your
home
and
that
you
have
been
greeted
with
songs
but
i
fear
you
have
yet
to
gain
the
scars
not
so
father
answered
odysseus
and
then
he
showed
them
the
great
white
scar
which
the
tusk
of
the
wild
boar
had
made
upon
his
knee
and
he
told
them
of
the
famous
hunt
in
the
woods
of
parnassus
and
of
the
days
of
pain
and
enforced
quiet
which
he
had
afterward
spent
on
an
invalid
s
couch
and
all
those
who
listened
to
his
story
were
struck
with
the
wisdom
of
his
thoughts
and
they
wondered
at
the
choice
beauty
of
the
words
which
fell
from
his
lips
soft
and
persuasive
like
the
flakes
of
snow
on
a
quiet
day
in
winter
after
this
many
pleasant
days
came
and
passed
the
folk
of
ithaca
went
about
their
tasks
as
of
yore
some
tending
their
flocks
in
the
mountain
pastures
some
gathering
the
autumn
fruits
from
the
overladen
trees
and
some
twirling
the
spindle
or
plying
the
loom
in
their
humble
homes
king
laertes
himself
worked
early
and
late
in
his
vineyards
or
in
his
orchard
grounds
and
odysseus
was
often
with
him
as
busy
as
he
tending
his
own
trees
and
vines
for
long
time
before
when
he
was
but
a
little
child
the
boy
had
walked
through
these
grounds
with
his
father
and
had
asked
the
names
of
the
trees
and
laertes
had
not
only
answered
the
prattler
but
had
given
him
a
whole
small
orchard
for
his
own
of
pear
trees
thirteen
of
apple
trees
ten
of
fig
trees
forty
and
he
promised
to
give
him
fifty
rows
of
vines
each
of
which
ripened
at
a
different
time
with
all
manner
of
clusters
on
their
boughs
sometimes
odysseus
went
out
with
other
boys
of
his
age
to
ramble
among
the
hills
and
on
the
wooded
mountain
slopes
sometimes
they
played
at
ball
in
the
open
field
or
loitered
around
the
flowing
spring
whence
the
people
of
the
town
drew
water
this
well
had
been
digged
and
walled
by
ithacus
and
neritus
the
first
settlers
of
the
island
and
close
by
it
was
a
thicket
of
reeds
and
alders
growing
green
and
rank
from
the
boggy
soil
while
on
the
rock
from
beneath
which
the
water
gushed
an
altar
had
been
built
where
all
wayfarers
laid
some
offering
for
the
nymphs
this
was
a
lovely
spot
and
in
the
heat
of
the
day
the
boys
would
often
sit
in
the
cool
shade
of
the
trees
and
play
a
quiet
game
with
pebbles
or
talk
about
the
noble
deeds
of
the
heroes
once
they
wandered
far
over
the
hills
to
the
sheltered
woodland
where
the
swine
of
laertes
were
kept
there
near
the
rock
called
corax
was
the
spring
of
arethusa
around
which
grew
many
great
oak
trees
yielding
abundance
of
acorns
there
the
slave
eumæus
lived
in
a
humble
lodge
of
his
own
building
and
fed
and
tended
his
master
s
swine
far
from
the
homes
of
other
men
when
the
swineherd
saw
odysseus
and
knew
that
he
was
the
master
s
son
he
ran
to
welcome
him
and
his
comrades
to
his
lowly
home
he
led
them
to
the
lodge
and
took
them
in
and
strewed
fragrant
leaves
upon
the
floor
and
stirred
the
blazing
fire
upon
the
hearth
then
he
hastened
to
the
sties
where
the
fattest
young
pigs
were
penned
two
of
these
he
killed
and
dressed
and
when
he
had
cut
them
in
pieces
he
roasted
the
choicest
parts
on
spits
before
the
fire
then
he
set
the
smoking
food
upon
a
table
before
odysseus
and
his
comrades
and
sprinkled
it
all
over
with
white
after
this
he
mixed
wine
with
water
in
a
wooden
bowl
and
sat
down
to
the
feast
with
them
right
heartily
did
they
eat
and
drink
and
many
were
the
pleasant
jests
that
were
passed
among
them
when
they
had
finished
odysseus
said
swineherd
eumæus
you
have
fed
us
right
nobly
and
there
is
nothing
more
welcome
to
tired
and
hungry
boys
than
plenty
of
food
surely
one
who
can
serve
so
royally
as
you
have
done
was
not
born
a
slave
nor
indeed
was
i
answered
eumæus
in
my
childhood
i
was
a
prince
noble
as
yourself
but
the
fates
bring
strange
fortunes
to
some
men
and
strangely
have
i
been
tossed
about
in
the
world
do
tell
us
said
odysseus
how
this
great
change
was
made
in
your
life
was
the
goodly
town
in
which
your
father
and
your
lady
mother
dwelt
laid
waste
by
an
enemy
or
did
unfriendly
men
find
you
in
the
fields
alone
and
sell
you
to
him
who
would
pay
the
goodliest
price
illustration
the
swineherd
telling
his
story
to
odysseus
since
you
ask
me
for
my
story
young
master
said
eumæus
i
will
tell
it
you
but
sit
you
here
upon
this
couch
of
goat
skins
while
you
listen
for
i
know
that
your
long
walk
has
wearied
you
far
out
in
the
sea
there
is
an
island
called
syria
above
which
the
sun
turns
in
its
course
it
is
not
very
thickly
peopled
but
it
is
rich
in
vineyards
and
wheatfields
and
in
pastures
where
thousands
of
cattle
graze
there
no
one
ever
goes
hungry
for
lack
of
food
and
sickness
never
comes
but
when
men
grow
old
then
apollo
and
artemis
his
huntress
sister
strike
them
with
their
noiseless
arrows
and
they
cease
to
live
in
that
island
stand
two
cities
fair
and
rich
and
over
them
both
my
father
is
sole
lord
and
king
there
in
his
white
halls
where
care
never
enters
my
infancy
was
passed
and
never
did
i
dream
of
the
hard
lot
which
the
pitiless
fates
had
decreed
for
me
one
day
there
came
to
our
island
some
phoenician
merchants
shrewd
seafaring
men
intent
on
trade
and
profit
in
their
ship
they
brought
countless
trinkets
to
barter
with
our
folk
for
corn
and
wine
and
they
moored
their
vessel
in
the
harbor
close
to
the
shore
in
my
father
s
house
there
dwelt
a
phoenician
tall
and
fair
and
skilled
in
needlework
and
when
the
merchants
knew
that
she
spoke
their
language
they
asked
her
who
she
was
and
from
whence
she
came
in
sidon
i
was
born
she
answered
and
arybas
my
father
was
one
of
the
wealthiest
of
sidonian
merchants
once
as
i
was
walking
on
the
shore
a
band
of
taphian
seized
me
unawares
and
carried
me
in
their
ship
across
the
sea
they
brought
me
to
this
island
and
sold
me
for
much
gold
to
the
man
who
lives
in
yonder
and
she
pointed
to
my
father
s
lofty
dwelling
then
the
merchants
asked
her
if
she
would
return
with
them
to
sidon
where
she
might
again
behold
her
father
and
mother
and
the
sweet
home
of
her
girlhood
and
she
consented
only
asking
that
they
pledge
themselves
to
take
her
safely
home
now
say
no
more
she
said
and
should
any
of
you
meet
me
on
the
road
or
by
the
well
hold
your
tongues
and
let
no
word
be
spoken
between
us
but
when
you
have
sold
your
goods
and
have
filled
your
ship
with
corn
and
wine
send
some
one
to
the
house
who
shall
tell
me
secretly
then
i
will
hie
me
to
your
vessel
bringing
gold
wherewith
to
pay
my
fare
and
if
fortune
favor
even
more
than
gold
for
i
am
nurse
to
the
little
son
of
my
master
a
cunning
prattler
whom
i
often
take
with
me
in
my
walks
i
will
bring
him
on
board
your
ship
and
when
you
have
reached
some
rich
foreign
land
you
can
sell
him
for
a
goodly
and
thus
having
settled
upon
a
plan
the
phoenician
woman
went
back
to
my
father
s
halls
and
the
merchants
staid
a
whole
year
in
our
harbor
and
filled
their
ship
with
grain
but
when
at
last
they
were
ready
to
sail
they
sent
a
messenger
to
tell
the
woman
he
came
to
our
house
with
many
trinkets
bracelets
and
golden
necklaces
which
pleased
the
eyes
of
my
lady
mother
and
her
maidens
and
while
they
were
looking
and
asking
the
price
he
signed
to
my
phoenician
nurse
and
straightway
gathered
up
his
goods
and
hastened
back
to
his
fellows
when
the
sun
went
down
the
woman
took
my
hand
and
led
me
from
the
house
as
she
had
often
done
before
thoughtlessly
i
followed
her
to
the
shore
where
the
ship
was
moored
the
phoenicians
took
us
both
on
board
they
hoisted
the
broad
sail
and
a
brisk
wind
quickly
carried
us
far
away
from
my
home
and
friends
on
the
seventh
day
artemis
the
archer
queen
smote
the
woman
with
her
silent
arrows
and
her
eyes
saw
no
more
the
sweet
light
of
heaven
then
the
crew
cast
her
forth
into
the
sea
to
be
food
for
fishes
and
the
sea
calves
and
i
was
left
alone
and
stricken
with
grief
and
fear
but
the
swift
ship
brought
us
ere
long
to
ithaca
and
there
those
who
had
stolen
me
bartered
me
to
laertes
for
a
goodly
price
and
that
is
why
i
am
your
father
s
thrall
and
dwell
here
lonely
underneath
these
sheltering
oaks
see
note
at
the
end
of
this
volume
such
was
the
tale
which
the
swineherd
told
odysseus
and
his
young
companions
as
they
sat
together
in
the
lodge
i
pity
thee
eumæus
said
the
lad
thy
story
is
indeed
a
sad
one
and
could
i
do
so
i
would
gladly
send
thee
back
to
syria
where
thy
mother
sorrows
even
yet
for
thee
alas
answered
the
swineherd
there
is
no
hope
no
ship
will
ever
sail
through
the
unknown
which
lead
to
my
boyhood
s
home
my
life
must
be
spent
in
this
spot
yet
i
am
happy
in
knowing
that
my
master
is
the
kindest
of
men
and
that
i
shall
be
well
provided
for
even
a
slave
may
find
enjoyment
if
his
heart
be
right
for
it
is
the
mind
and
not
the
force
of
outward
things
that
makes
us
rich
and
free
x
sea
robbers
of
messene
five
years
passed
quietly
by
and
brought
few
changes
to
ithaca
the
flocks
still
grazed
in
their
mountain
pastures
the
orchard
trees
still
bent
under
their
loads
of
ripening
fruit
the
vines
still
yielded
their
treasures
of
purple
and
red
the
islanders
arose
each
day
with
the
coming
of
the
dawn
they
went
about
their
tasks
with
cheerfulness
they
sang
and
danced
and
ate
their
accustomed
meals
and
then
with
the
coming
of
night
they
lay
down
to
sleep
to
them
all
days
were
alike
and
life
was
but
one
pleasant
round
of
duties
but
king
laertes
as
he
grew
older
sought
more
and
more
the
quiet
of
his
farm
and
garden
and
for
the
most
part
he
allowed
his
little
kingdom
to
take
care
of
itself
and
his
subjects
to
do
as
they
pleased
and
in
these
five
years
young
odysseus
had
become
a
man
he
had
grown
not
so
much
in
stature
as
in
wisdom
nor
yet
so
much
in
size
of
limb
and
body
as
in
strength
of
bone
and
muscle
there
was
nothing
in
his
face
or
figure
that
could
be
called
handsome
and
yet
he
was
the
pride
of
ithaca
for
in
all
the
deeds
and
feats
most
worthy
of
men
he
was
without
a
peer
in
wrestling
and
leaping
in
rowing
and
swimming
in
shooting
with
the
bow
and
in
handling
the
heavy
spear
there
was
no
one
that
could
equal
him
he
was
a
very
master
of
words
and
when
his
speech
warmed
into
earnestness
the
dullest
hearer
was
by
his
eloquence
even
to
the
achaian
mainland
and
among
the
islands
of
the
sea
he
was
famed
for
his
shrewdness
indeed
his
craftiness
oftentimes
outweighed
his
sense
of
honor
for
in
that
early
day
to
outwit
one
s
fellows
even
by
fraud
was
thought
to
be
praiseworthy
one
evening
in
summer
four
strange
ships
with
long
black
hulls
sailed
into
the
harbor
at
ithaca
and
were
moored
in
the
deep
water
close
to
the
shore
they
were
found
to
be
manned
by
crews
of
seafarers
from
the
shores
of
messene
and
their
captain
brought
greetings
from
orsilochus
their
king
and
offered
to
barter
silver
and
merchandise
for
ithacan
wool
and
sheep
laertes
welcomed
the
strangers
warmly
and
as
the
night
was
near
he
advised
that
early
on
the
morrow
they
should
bring
their
wares
ashore
and
allow
his
people
to
bargain
for
what
they
needed
most
and
soon
darkness
covered
all
the
ways
and
ithaca
was
wrapped
in
slumber
when
the
gray
dawn
peeped
into
his
chamber
and
awakened
him
the
king
arose
and
looked
out
towards
the
harbor
not
one
of
the
ships
could
he
see
they
had
silently
cast
their
moorings
and
had
stolen
away
through
the
darkness
while
the
king
looked
and
wondered
an
old
shepherd
with
frightened
face
and
gestures
of
alarm
came
running
in
breathless
haste
to
the
palace
in
a
few
words
he
told
what
strange
things
had
happened
by
the
light
of
the
waning
moon
the
sea
rovers
from
messene
had
sailed
around
to
a
little
cove
where
the
pastures
slope
down
to
the
water
s
edge
there
they
had
landed
and
without
much
ado
had
driven
a
whole
flock
of
sheep
aboard
their
ships
three
hundred
ewes
and
bleating
lambs
the
choicest
of
the
fields
and
they
had
carried
away
not
only
these
but
the
six
sleepy
shepherds
whose
duty
it
had
been
to
guard
them
an
alarm
was
quickly
sounded
and
the
news
was
passed
from
mouth
to
mouth
until
it
was
known
to
all
the
bravest
men
of
ithaca
hastened
to
the
shore
where
stood
odysseus
and
his
father
ready
to
direct
them
their
fleetest
vessels
lying
high
upon
the
beach
were
cleared
ready
to
be
launched
five
ships
with
vermilion
prows
were
pushed
into
the
waves
and
each
was
manned
by
a
score
of
lusty
rowers
and
headed
towards
the
open
sea
the
long
oars
dipped
into
the
water
as
if
all
were
moved
by
a
single
hand
and
the
vessels
sped
out
upon
their
errand
like
dogs
of
the
chase
intent
upon
a
fleeing
victim
the
sky
was
clear
the
waves
danced
merrily
in
the
sunlight
the
wind
blew
gently
from
the
shore
the
crews
of
the
ithacan
ships
bent
to
the
oars
like
practised
seamen
but
when
they
rounded
the
headlands
at
the
foot
of
the
bay
and
came
out
upon
the
open
sea
they
saw
no
trace
of
the
pirate
fleet
nor
even
a
single
sail
upon
the
laughing
face
of
the
deep
whether
the
men
of
messene
had
pushed
straight
homeward
with
their
plunder
or
whether
they
had
put
into
some
other
cove
or
inlet
farther
down
the
coast
no
one
could
guess
all
that
their
pursuers
could
do
was
to
sail
close
along
the
shore
southward
towards
cephallenia
peering
behind
every
jutting
headland
and
into
every
sheltered
nook
in
hopes
of
coming
upon
them
five
days
afterward
the
ships
returned
to
ithaca
nothing
had
been
seen
of
the
sea
robbers
nothing
had
been
heard
of
the
stolen
flocks
what
was
to
be
done
the
robbers
were
known
to
be
men
of
messene
the
subjects
of
orsilochus
it
was
no
secret
that
much
of
the
wealth
of
messene
had
been
gotten
by
the
plunder
and
pillage
of
foreign
coasts
but
were
the
pirates
of
that
country
to
be
allowed
thus
to
rob
their
near
neighbors
and
kinsfolk
laertes
called
together
a
council
of
the
chiefs
and
elders
and
asked
them
what
it
was
best
to
do
we
are
a
peaceful
people
said
some
of
the
older
men
and
it
would
neither
be
wise
nor
pleasant
to
entangle
ourselves
in
a
war
with
a
strong
king
like
orsilochus
the
loss
of
three
hundred
sheep
is
not
much
where
there
are
so
many
and
it
is
not
likely
that
the
sea
robbers
will
ever
trouble
us
again
let
us
go
quietly
back
to
our
fields
and
homes
and
leave
well
enough
alone
but
the
young
men
would
not
listen
to
a
plan
so
tame
and
spiritless
they
were
eager
if
they
could
not
recover
what
was
their
own
to
take
at
least
what
was
of
equal
value
from
the
messenians
it
would
be
easy
they
said
for
a
few
stanch
ships
with
crews
to
cross
the
and
land
by
night
upon
the
rich
coast
of
messene
there
they
could
fill
the
roomy
holds
of
their
vessels
with
fruit
and
grain
and
before
any
one
could
hinder
they
would
sail
safely
back
to
ithaca
laden
with
wealth
far
greater
than
three
hundred
sheep
then
odysseus
though
a
mere
youth
among
bearded
men
stood
up
before
them
and
said
my
good
friends
i
like
neither
the
one
plan
nor
the
other
it
is
but
the
part
of
a
slave
to
suffer
wrong
without
striking
back
it
is
but
the
part
of
a
coward
to
strike
in
the
dark
as
if
fearing
the
enemy
s
face
why
not
send
boldly
to
messene
and
demand
either
the
stolen
sheep
or
a
fair
price
for
them
i
myself
will
undertake
the
business
and
i
promise
you
that
i
will
bring
back
to
ithaca
gifts
and
goods
worth
twice
as
much
as
the
flock
that
has
been
taken
the
elders
listened
with
favor
to
the
young
man
s
words
and
after
further
talk
it
was
settled
that
he
should
go
forthwith
across
the
sea
to
claim
the
debt
which
was
due
from
the
people
of
messene
the
goodliest
ship
of
all
the
ithacan
galleys
was
made
ready
for
odysseus
the
needed
stores
of
food
and
drink
were
brought
on
board
and
placed
in
the
vessel
s
hold
the
young
hero
with
his
friend
and
tutor
phemius
climbed
over
the
vessel
s
side
and
sat
down
in
the
prow
the
seamen
cast
loose
the
moorings
they
plied
their
oars
and
the
swift
ship
was
soon
far
out
upon
the
waters
a
steady
north
wind
filled
the
sail
and
the
vessel
sped
swiftly
on
her
way
cleaving
the
white
foam
with
her
keel
by
and
by
the
sun
went
down
and
night
wrapped
the
world
in
her
sober
mantle
but
the
ship
still
held
its
course
being
guided
by
the
moon
s
pale
light
and
the
steadfast
star
of
the
north
the
next
day
they
sailed
within
sight
of
the
coast
of
elis
which
stretched
northward
and
southward
farther
than
their
eyes
could
reach
yet
they
turned
not
to
the
shore
but
sailed
straight
on
for
odysseus
advised
by
pallas
athené
wished
first
to
visit
pylos
where
wise
old
nestor
ruled
with
his
father
the
ancient
neleus
this
neleus
was
the
uncle
of
jason
chief
of
the
argonauts
and
had
been
driven
from
iolcos
by
pelias
the
usurper
long
time
had
he
wandered
an
exile
in
strange
lands
until
aphareus
of
arene
gave
him
leave
to
build
a
city
on
the
sandy
plain
close
by
the
sea
there
he
had
reared
a
noble
palace
and
there
he
still
dwelt
having
outlived
three
generations
of
men
but
he
had
given
up
his
kingdom
many
years
before
to
his
son
nestor
himself
a
sage
old
man
it
was
not
until
late
on
the
third
day
that
the
voyagers
turned
their
ship
s
prow
into
the
harbor
of
pylos
it
touched
the
shore
and
odysseus
with
his
tutor
sprang
out
upon
the
sands
they
found
the
people
of
the
city
offering
sacrifices
there
to
poseidon
ruler
of
the
deep
upon
nine
long
seats
they
were
sitting
five
hundred
or
more
on
each
seat
and
the
priest
stood
up
before
them
pouring
out
libations
and
offering
sacrifices
nine
heifers
he
offered
to
poseidon
king
nestor
sat
upon
a
lofty
seat
while
the
elders
of
the
city
stood
around
him
or
plied
their
several
duties
at
the
feast
some
of
them
were
busy
cutting
choice
bits
of
flesh
from
the
slaughtered
beeves
others
fixed
these
bits
upon
spits
and
roasted
them
over
heaps
of
glowing
coals
and
still
others
handed
the
smoking
food
to
the
waiting
people
who
sat
hungry
in
their
places
when
nestor
saw
odysseus
and
the
bard
two
strangers
standing
upon
the
shore
he
arose
and
went
down
to
meet
them
he
gave
to
each
a
hand
and
leading
them
to
the
feast
he
seated
them
upon
soft
skins
spread
on
piles
of
yielding
sand
then
he
brought
to
them
in
his
own
hands
choicest
pieces
of
and
food
and
when
they
had
eaten
as
much
as
they
liked
he
poured
rich
wine
into
a
golden
goblet
and
as
he
offered
it
first
to
the
noble
bard
he
said
right
welcome
are
you
stranger
whoever
you
may
be
to
this
our
midsummer
festival
i
give
this
golden
goblet
to
you
first
you
being
the
older
man
that
you
may
pray
as
beseemeth
you
to
great
poseidon
when
you
have
made
your
prayer
hand
then
the
cup
to
the
young
man
who
is
with
you
that
he
too
may
pour
out
a
libation
for
all
men
have
need
to
pray
then
the
bard
took
the
goblet
and
pouring
out
a
rich
libation
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
prayed
great
poseidon
thou
who
dost
hold
the
earth
in
thy
strong
arms
hear
now
the
prayer
of
thy
suppliant
prolong
still
the
life
of
our
aged
host
and
add
to
nestor
with
each
circling
year
new
honors
and
greater
wealth
to
the
folk
of
pylos
give
rich
contentment
and
that
peace
which
is
the
befitting
prize
of
those
who
are
mindful
of
life
s
varied
duties
and
lastly
grant
that
this
young
man
may
find
that
which
he
seeks
and
then
return
rejoicing
to
his
home
and
friends
when
he
had
thus
spoken
he
gave
the
goblet
to
odysseus
and
he
in
like
manner
poured
out
libations
and
prayed
to
great
poseidon
then
said
nestor
as
he
took
again
the
goblet
strangers
you
do
wisely
thus
to
offer
prayers
to
the
gods
for
they
are
far
above
us
in
virtue
strength
and
honor
when
men
have
failed
to
do
aright
and
have
broken
heaven
s
just
laws
they
may
still
by
humble
vows
and
supplications
turn
aside
from
and
soften
the
wrath
of
the
powers
yes
truly
answered
phemius
by
prayers
we
do
honor
both
ourselves
and
those
to
whom
we
pray
there
is
an
ancient
saying
which
no
doubt
you
oft
have
heard
that
prayers
are
the
daughters
of
father
zeus
and
wrinkled
and
lame
they
follow
in
misfortune
s
track
but
misfortune
strong
and
swift
them
often
and
brings
distress
upon
the
sons
of
men
then
these
blessed
prayers
following
after
kindly
heal
the
hurts
and
bind
up
the
aching
wounds
which
have
been
made
and
for
this
reason
the
man
who
is
wont
to
pray
feels
less
the
strokes
of
fortune
than
does
he
who
lives
forgetful
of
the
gods
see
note
at
the
end
of
this
volume
the
feast
being
soon
ended
nestor
turned
again
to
the
strangers
and
said
behold
now
the
day
is
gone
and
all
have
paid
their
vows
to
the
gods
the
time
has
come
when
we
may
ask
our
their
names
and
errand
who
are
you
who
come
thus
unheralded
to
the
sandy
shores
of
pylos
is
your
visit
one
of
peace
and
shall
we
welcome
you
as
friends
or
do
you
come
as
spies
to
find
out
what
there
may
be
of
wealth
or
of
weakness
in
our
city
odysseus
answered
o
noble
nestor
we
will
speak
the
truth
and
hide
nothing
from
you
i
am
odysseus
of
ithaca
my
father
is
king
laertes
who
was
once
your
comrade
when
you
sailed
on
the
argo
to
golden
colchis
ten
days
ago
there
came
to
our
island
seafaring
men
from
messene
whom
we
welcomed
as
friends
and
neighbors
but
under
cover
of
the
night
they
landed
on
our
shores
they
seized
three
hundred
of
our
sheep
together
with
the
shepherds
and
bore
them
across
the
sea
to
some
one
of
the
pirate
harbors
of
messene
i
now
am
on
my
way
to
king
orsilochus
to
bid
him
send
back
the
stolen
flock
and
if
he
will
not
hearken
to
my
words
then
i
shall
either
gain
by
guile
or
take
by
force
double
the
value
of
the
sheep
but
i
have
come
first
to
pylos
that
you
my
father
s
friend
might
know
my
errand
and
if
need
be
lend
me
your
aid
you
have
spoken
well
answered
nestor
and
for
your
father
s
sake
you
are
thrice
welcome
to
the
lofty
halls
of
pylos
abide
with
me
for
one
night
and
in
the
morning
i
will
give
you
a
car
and
steeds
and
a
trustworthy
guide
to
take
you
by
the
straightest
road
to
pherae
where
the
king
of
messene
dwells
orsilochus
must
learn
from
me
that
though
his
may
plunder
foreign
shores
they
must
not
molest
the
flocks
and
goods
of
our
neighbors
having
thus
spoken
he
led
the
way
to
the
fair
palace
which
his
father
neleus
erstwhile
had
built
there
they
found
that
aged
chieftain
sitting
in
the
great
hall
upon
a
soft
couch
spread
with
purple
coverings
his
hair
and
his
long
beard
were
white
as
the
driven
snow
and
his
hands
trembled
from
very
feebleness
for
he
was
exceeding
old
he
spoke
kindly
to
odysseus
and
asked
many
questions
about
his
father
laertes
and
his
home
in
ithaca
but
he
seemed
most
pleased
when
the
young
man
told
him
of
his
visit
when
a
boy
to
iolcos
and
mount
pelion
for
iolcos
had
been
the
home
of
neleus
in
his
youth
and
he
it
was
who
had
helped
pelias
drive
æson
from
the
kingdom
which
was
his
by
right
but
nemesis
had
followed
him
and
punished
him
for
the
deed
soon
the
shades
of
night
began
to
darken
the
fair
hall
and
the
chiefs
and
elders
went
each
one
to
his
own
house
but
nestor
led
odysseus
and
the
bard
to
an
upper
chamber
where
a
fair
soft
couch
was
spread
upon
a
jointed
bedstead
there
he
left
them
for
the
night
and
there
they
soon
found
rest
in
soothing
slumber
as
soon
as
the
light
of
day
began
to
streak
the
eastern
sky
the
aged
neleus
as
was
his
wont
arose
from
his
couch
and
leaning
on
the
arm
of
nestor
went
feebly
out
and
took
his
seat
upon
a
smooth
white
stone
before
the
palace
gate
then
every
one
who
had
aught
of
grievance
or
had
suffered
any
wrong
came
and
told
his
story
and
made
his
plea
and
the
old
hero
weighed
the
matter
with
an
even
hand
and
gave
judgment
for
the
right
what
shall
be
done
to
aid
the
son
of
laertes
that
so
his
journey
into
messene
shall
prosper
asked
nestor
thou
knowest
that
king
orsilochus
has
ever
been
our
friend
and
ally
yet
shall
we
allow
his
lawless
men
thus
to
despoil
our
neighbors
and
comrades
send
to
pherae
with
the
young
man
a
trusty
messenger
who
shall
speak
for
him
answered
old
neleus
send
them
both
in
thy
own
chariot
and
ask
orsilochus
in
the
name
of
a
friend
to
deal
justly
with
the
son
of
laertes
by
this
time
odysseus
and
the
bard
had
awakened
from
their
slumber
they
arose
and
when
they
had
bathed
and
had
been
anointed
with
soft
oil
they
clothed
themselves
in
robes
of
noble
texture
and
went
down
into
the
banquet
hall
there
they
found
king
nestor
waiting
and
they
sat
down
with
him
at
the
table
and
willing
servants
waited
on
them
bringing
choice
food
and
pouring
sweet
wine
into
golden
goblets
when
the
meal
was
finished
the
bard
bade
his
host
farewell
and
praying
that
the
gods
would
speed
odysseus
on
his
errand
he
went
down
to
the
ship
which
was
waiting
by
the
shore
and
as
soon
as
he
stepped
on
board
the
sailors
loosed
the
moorings
and
set
the
sail
and
a
brisk
wind
bore
them
swiftly
back
towards
ithaca
but
nestor
spoke
to
the
young
men
about
him
bring
out
my
finest
horses
and
yoke
them
forthwith
to
my
lightest
car
they
shall
carry
odysseus
on
his
journey
across
the
plain
to
pherae
and
my
son
antilochus
shall
bear
him
company
and
be
my
messenger
to
the
messenian
king
soon
the
car
was
ready
the
young
men
took
their
places
and
antilochus
touching
the
restive
horses
with
his
whip
they
sped
across
the
dusty
plain
it
was
a
rough
and
tiresome
journey
along
unbroken
ways
and
roads
scarcely
marked
with
tracks
of
wheels
or
horses
hoofs
and
night
had
begun
to
fall
ere
they
came
to
the
river
nedon
and
the
high
walls
of
pherae
where
dwelt
orsilochus
the
king
of
messene
illustration
alpheus
and
arethusa
xi
bow
of
eurytus
in
arcadia
there
is
a
little
mountain
stream
called
alpheus
it
flows
through
woods
and
meadows
and
among
the
hills
for
many
miles
and
then
it
sinks
beneath
the
rocks
farther
down
the
valley
it
rises
again
and
dancing
and
sparkling
as
if
in
happy
chase
of
something
it
hurries
onward
towards
the
plain
but
soon
it
hides
itself
a
second
time
in
underground
caverns
making
its
way
through
rocky
tunnels
where
the
light
of
day
has
never
been
then
at
last
it
gushes
once
more
from
its
prison
chambers
and
flowing
thence
with
many
windings
through
the
fields
of
elis
it
empties
its
waters
into
the
sea
of
this
strange
river
a
strange
tale
is
told
and
this
is
what
antilochus
related
to
odysseus
as
they
rode
across
the
plain
towards
pherae
years
ago
there
was
no
river
alpheus
the
channel
through
which
it
flows
had
not
then
been
hollowed
out
and
rank
grass
and
tall
bending
reeds
grew
thick
where
now
its
waters
sparkle
brightest
it
was
then
that
a
huntsman
bearing
the
name
of
alpheus
ranged
through
the
woods
and
chased
the
wild
deer
among
the
glades
and
glens
of
sweet
arcadia
far
away
by
the
lonely
sea
dwelt
telegona
his
fair
young
wife
and
his
lovely
babe
orsilochus
but
dearer
than
home
or
wife
or
babe
to
alpheus
was
the
free
life
of
the
huntsman
among
the
mountain
solitudes
for
he
loved
the
woods
and
the
blue
sky
and
the
singing
birds
and
the
frail
flowers
upon
the
hillside
and
he
longed
to
live
among
them
always
where
his
ears
could
listen
to
their
music
and
his
eyes
look
upon
their
beauty
o
artemis
he
cried
i
ask
but
one
boon
of
thee
let
me
ramble
forever
among
these
happy
scenes
and
artemis
heard
him
and
answered
his
prayer
for
as
he
spoke
a
bright
vision
passed
before
him
a
maiden
went
tripping
down
the
valley
culling
the
choicest
flowers
and
singing
of
hope
and
joy
and
the
blessedness
of
a
life
pure
and
true
it
was
arethusa
the
arcadian
nymph
by
some
supposed
to
be
a
daughter
of
old
nereus
the
elder
of
the
sea
then
alpheus
heard
no
more
the
songs
of
the
birds
or
the
music
of
the
breeze
he
saw
no
longer
the
blue
sky
above
him
or
the
nodding
flowers
at
his
feet
he
was
blind
and
deaf
to
all
the
world
save
only
the
beautiful
nymph
arethusa
was
the
world
to
him
he
reached
out
his
arms
to
catch
her
but
swifter
than
a
frightened
deer
she
fled
down
the
valley
through
deep
ravines
and
grassy
glades
and
rocky
caverns
underneath
the
hills
and
out
into
the
grassy
meadows
and
across
the
plains
of
elis
to
the
sounding
sea
and
alpheus
followed
forgetful
of
every
thing
but
the
fleeing
vision
when
at
length
he
reached
the
sea
he
looked
back
and
lo
he
was
no
longer
a
huntsman
but
a
river
doomed
to
meander
forever
among
the
scenes
for
love
of
which
he
had
forgotten
his
wife
and
his
babe
and
the
duties
of
life
it
was
thus
that
artemis
answered
his
prayer
and
men
say
that
arethusa
the
nymph
was
afterwards
changed
into
a
fountain
and
that
to
this
day
in
the
island
of
ortygia
that
fountain
gushes
from
the
rocks
in
an
unfailing
crystal
stream
but
orsilochus
the
babe
forgotten
by
his
father
grew
to
manhood
and
in
course
of
time
became
the
king
of
pherae
and
the
seafaring
people
of
messene
when
odysseus
and
his
companion
reached
pherae
the
sun
had
set
and
the
gates
of
the
palace
were
closed
but
the
porter
sent
a
messenger
into
the
hall
where
king
orsilochus
was
sitting
at
the
evening
meal
who
said
o
king
the
car
of
nestor
our
worthy
neighbor
stands
outside
the
gate
and
in
the
car
are
two
young
men
richly
clothed
like
princes
and
bearing
themselves
in
a
most
princely
manner
forthwith
the
king
arose
and
went
out
to
the
gate
and
welcomed
the
young
men
to
his
city
and
his
halls
and
he
took
them
by
the
hand
and
led
them
into
the
where
the
chiefs
of
pherae
and
messene
already
sat
at
meat
he
put
the
spears
which
they
bore
in
a
where
were
other
goodly
weapons
leaning
against
the
wall
then
he
seated
them
on
chairs
of
cunning
workmanship
beneath
which
were
linen
rugs
of
many
colors
and
he
gave
to
each
an
oaken
footstool
for
his
feet
then
a
maid
poured
water
into
a
basin
of
silver
that
they
might
wash
their
hands
and
she
drew
a
polished
table
near
them
on
which
another
maid
placed
white
loaves
of
bread
and
many
dainties
to
the
taste
of
tired
travellers
and
the
carver
brought
divers
tempting
dishes
of
roasted
meats
and
a
herald
poured
red
wine
into
golden
bowls
and
set
them
within
easy
reach
when
they
had
eaten
and
had
forgotten
their
hunger
and
thirst
and
weariness
an
old
blind
bard
came
into
the
hall
and
as
he
sat
in
a
high
seat
leaning
against
a
pillar
he
took
his
harp
in
his
hand
and
touching
it
with
his
deft
fingers
sang
sweet
songs
of
the
gods
and
the
heroes
and
famous
men
not
until
he
had
finished
his
music
and
laid
aside
his
harp
did
orsilochus
venture
to
speak
of
any
thing
that
might
disturb
the
pleasure
of
his
guests
then
with
words
he
asked
them
their
names
and
their
errand
our
fathers
answered
odysseus
are
nestor
and
laertes
well
known
among
the
heroes
who
sailed
with
jason
to
the
golden
strand
of
colchis
and
the
errand
upon
which
we
come
is
one
of
right
and
justice
and
then
he
told
the
king
how
the
crews
of
the
messenian
ships
had
landed
in
ithaca
and
carried
away
his
father
s
choicest
flock
orsilochus
listened
kindly
and
when
odysseus
had
ended
he
said
think
no
more
of
this
troublesome
matter
for
i
will
see
that
it
is
righted
at
once
the
men
who
dared
thus
to
wrong
your
father
shall
restore
fourfold
the
value
of
the
stolen
flocks
and
shall
humbly
beg
the
pardon
of
laertes
as
well
as
of
myself
i
have
spoken
and
it
shall
be
done
but
you
must
tarry
a
while
with
me
in
pherae
and
be
my
honored
guest
thus
odysseus
brought
to
a
happy
end
the
quest
upon
which
he
had
come
to
messene
and
the
town
of
pherae
and
he
tarried
many
days
in
the
pleasant
halls
of
the
king
and
was
held
in
higher
honor
than
all
the
other
guests
but
antilochus
on
the
second
morning
mounted
again
his
father
s
chariot
and
journeyed
onward
into
laconia
why
he
went
thither
and
did
not
return
to
pylos
odysseus
was
soon
to
learn
one
evening
there
came
to
pherae
a
lordly
stranger
bringing
with
him
a
train
of
men
and
bearing
a
handsome
present
for
orsilochus
he
was
very
tall
and
handsome
he
stood
erect
as
a
mountain
pine
and
his
eyes
flashed
keen
and
sharp
as
those
of
an
eagle
but
his
long
white
hair
and
frosted
beard
betokened
a
man
of
many
years
and
his
furrowed
brow
showed
plainly
that
he
had
not
lived
free
from
care
i
am
iphitus
of
œchalia
he
said
and
i
am
journeying
to
lacedæmon
where
great
tyndareus
rules
when
odysseus
heard
the
name
of
iphitus
he
remembered
it
as
that
of
a
dear
friend
of
whom
his
father
had
often
spoken
and
he
asked
are
you
that
iphitus
who
sailed
with
jason
to
golden
colchis
and
do
you
remember
among
your
comrades
one
laertes
of
ithaca
there
is
but
one
iphitus
was
the
answer
and
i
am
he
never
can
i
forget
the
laertes
of
ithaca
for
on
board
the
argo
he
was
my
messmate
my
bedfellow
my
friend
my
sworn
brother
there
is
no
man
whom
i
love
more
dearly
would
that
i
could
see
him
or
even
know
that
he
still
lives
when
he
learned
that
odysseus
was
the
son
of
his
friend
he
was
overjoyed
and
he
took
him
by
the
hand
and
wept
for
very
gladness
then
he
asked
the
young
man
a
thousand
questions
about
his
father
and
his
mother
and
his
father
s
little
kingdom
of
ithaca
and
odysseus
answered
him
truly
for
his
heart
was
filled
with
love
for
the
noble
old
hero
and
he
felt
justly
proud
of
his
friendship
and
after
this
so
long
as
they
staid
at
pherae
the
young
man
and
the
old
were
constantly
together
one
day
as
they
were
walking
alone
outside
of
the
city
walls
iphitus
said
do
you
see
this
noble
bow
which
i
carry
and
which
i
always
keep
within
easy
reach
it
would
be
hard
not
to
see
it
answered
odysseus
smiling
for
where
you
are
there
also
is
the
bow
i
have
often
wondered
why
you
guard
it
with
so
great
care
it
is
the
bow
of
my
father
eurytus
answered
the
hero
and
next
to
apollo
s
silver
weapon
it
is
the
most
wonderful
ever
made
my
father
dwelt
in
œchalia
and
was
skilled
in
archery
above
all
other
men
and
the
sons
of
the
heroes
came
to
him
to
learn
how
to
shoot
the
silent
arrow
with
most
deadly
aim
even
heracles
the
mightiest
of
was
taught
by
him
but
heracles
requited
him
unkindly
in
my
father
s
halls
close
by
the
shore
of
the
eastern
sea
there
were
many
bright
treasures
and
precious
gems
and
rarest
works
of
art
but
more
beautiful
than
any
of
these
and
more
precious
to
my
father
s
heart
than
any
glittering
jewel
was
our
only
sister
the
lovely
iole
and
when
heracles
went
out
from
the
land
of
his
birth
to
toil
and
do
the
bidding
of
false
eurystheus
he
tarried
for
a
day
in
my
father
s
halls
there
he
saw
iole
the
maiden
and
his
great
strong
heart
was
taken
captive
by
her
gentle
will
but
the
stern
words
of
eurystheus
fell
upon
his
ears
and
bade
him
go
forth
at
once
to
the
labors
which
had
been
allotted
him
he
went
for
he
had
vowed
long
time
before
always
to
obey
the
calls
of
duty
and
iole
grieved
for
him
in
secret
yet
every
day
she
grew
wiser
and
more
beautiful
and
every
day
the
tendrils
of
her
love
were
twined
more
and
more
closely
about
my
father
s
heart
heracles
went
out
to
do
the
thankless
tasks
which
his
master
eurystheus
had
bidden
him
do
in
the
swamps
of
lerna
he
slew
the
hydra
and
dipped
his
arrows
in
its
poisonous
blood
in
the
forests
of
arcadia
he
caught
the
stag
sacred
to
artemis
in
the
snowy
glens
of
erymanthus
he
hunted
the
fierce
wild
boar
which
had
long
been
the
terror
of
men
and
having
caught
him
in
a
net
he
carried
him
to
mycenæ
in
elis
he
cleansed
the
stables
of
augeas
turning
the
waters
of
the
river
alpheus
into
the
stalls
of
his
oxen
in
the
marshes
of
stymphalus
he
put
to
flight
the
loathsome
harpies
and
rested
not
from
following
them
until
they
were
outside
the
borders
of
hellas
in
the
sunset
land
of
the
hesperides
he
plucked
the
golden
apples
which
hung
ripe
in
the
gardens
of
here
and
he
slew
the
fiery
dragon
that
kept
watch
and
ward
around
them
and
lastly
he
went
down
into
the
dark
kingdom
of
hades
and
brought
thence
the
mighty
hound
cerberus
carrying
him
in
his
strong
arms
into
the
very
presence
of
eurystheus
all
these
deeds
and
many
more
did
heracles
because
they
were
tasks
set
for
him
by
his
master
but
other
things
even
mightier
than
they
did
he
do
because
of
his
love
for
suffering
men
at
length
when
the
days
of
his
servitude
to
eurystheus
were
ended
he
came
again
to
hellas
and
dwelt
a
long
time
in
calydon
with
his
friend
oineus
see
note
at
the
end
of
this
volume
when
iphitus
had
thus
spoken
he
was
silent
for
a
time
and
odysseus
seeing
that
he
was
busy
with
his
own
thoughts
asked
him
no
questions
then
as
if
talking
in
a
dream
he
said
do
you
see
this
bow
the
bow
of
my
father
eurytus
much
grief
has
it
brought
upon
our
house
and
yet
it
was
not
the
bow
but
my
father
s
overweening
pride
that
wrought
the
mischief
and
caused
me
to
go
sorrowing
through
life
shall
i
finish
my
story
by
telling
you
how
it
all
ended
tell
me
all
answered
odysseus
my
father
eurytus
as
i
have
said
was
the
king
of
archers
for
no
man
could
draw
an
arrow
with
so
unerring
aim
as
he
and
no
man
could
send
it
straight
to
the
mark
with
a
more
deadly
force
every
thought
of
his
waking
hours
was
upon
his
bow
and
he
aspired
to
excel
even
the
archery
of
artemis
and
apollo
at
length
he
sent
a
challenge
into
every
city
of
hellas
will
excel
eurytus
in
shooting
with
the
bow
and
arrows
let
him
come
to
œchalia
and
try
his
skill
the
prize
to
be
given
to
him
who
succeeds
is
iole
the
fair
daughter
of
then
there
came
to
the
contest
great
numbers
of
young
men
the
pride
of
hellas
but
when
they
saw
this
wonderful
bow
of
eurytus
and
tried
its
strength
their
hearts
sank
within
them
and
when
they
aimed
their
shafts
at
the
target
they
shot
far
wide
of
the
mark
and
my
father
sent
them
home
ashamed
and
without
the
prize
my
dearest
iole
he
would
often
say
i
am
not
afraid
of
losing
you
for
there
lives
no
man
who
knows
the
bow
as
well
as
but
by
and
by
great
heracles
heard
of
my
father
s
boasts
and
of
the
prize
which
he
had
offered
i
will
go
down
to
œchalia
said
he
and
i
will
win
the
fair
iole
for
my
and
when
he
came
my
father
remembered
how
he
had
taught
him
archery
in
his
youth
and
he
felt
that
in
his
old
pupil
he
had
at
last
found
a
peer
yet
he
would
not
cease
his
boasting
if
the
apollo
should
come
to
try
his
skill
i
would
not
fear
to
contend
even
with
then
the
target
was
set
up
so
far
away
that
it
seemed
as
if
one
might
as
well
shoot
at
the
sun
now
my
good
bow
said
my
father
thou
hast
never
failed
me
do
thou
serve
me
better
than
ever
before
he
drew
the
strong
cord
back
bending
the
bow
to
its
utmost
tension
and
then
the
swift
arrow
leaped
from
its
place
and
sped
like
a
beam
of
light
straight
towards
the
mark
but
before
it
reached
its
goal
the
strength
which
my
father
s
arm
had
imparted
to
it
began
to
fail
it
wavered
in
the
air
its
point
turned
downward
and
it
struck
the
ground
at
the
foot
of
the
target
then
heracles
took
up
his
bow
and
carelessly
aimed
a
shaft
at
the
distant
mark
like
the
lightning
which
zeus
hurls
from
the
high
clouds
straight
down
upon
the
head
of
some
lordly
oak
so
flashed
the
unfailing
arrow
through
the
intervening
space
piercing
the
very
centre
of
the
target
lo
now
eurytus
my
friend
said
heracles
thou
seest
that
i
have
won
the
victory
over
thee
where
now
is
the
prize
even
the
lovely
iole
that
was
promised
to
him
who
could
shoot
better
than
thou
but
my
father
s
heart
sank
within
him
and
shame
and
grief
took
mighty
hold
of
him
and
he
sent
iole
away
in
a
ship
to
the
farther
shores
of
the
sea
and
would
not
give
her
to
heracles
as
he
had
promised
then
the
great
hero
turned
him
about
in
anger
and
went
back
to
his
home
in
calydon
threatening
vengeance
upon
the
house
of
eurytus
i
besought
my
father
that
he
would
remember
his
word
and
would
call
iole
home
again
and
would
send
her
to
heracles
to
be
his
bride
but
he
would
not
hearken
for
the
great
sorrow
which
weighed
upon
him
he
placed
his
matchless
bow
in
my
hands
and
bade
me
keep
it
until
i
should
find
a
young
hero
worthy
to
bear
it
it
has
served
me
well
he
said
but
i
shall
never
need
it
then
he
bowed
his
head
upon
his
hands
and
when
i
looked
again
the
life
had
gone
from
him
some
men
say
that
apollo
to
punish
him
for
his
boasting
slew
him
with
one
of
his
silent
arrows
others
say
that
heracles
smote
him
because
he
refused
to
give
to
the
victor
the
promised
prize
even
fair
iole
the
idol
of
his
heart
but
i
know
that
it
was
grief
and
shame
and
neither
apollo
nor
heracles
that
brought
death
upon
him
as
to
heracles
he
dwelt
a
long
time
in
calydon
where
he
wooed
and
won
the
princess
deianeira
the
daughter
of
old
oineus
but
the
memory
of
iole
as
she
had
been
to
him
in
the
bright
days
of
his
youth
was
never
blotted
from
his
mind
and
the
people
of
calydon
loved
him
because
with
all
his
greatness
and
his
strength
he
was
the
friend
and
helper
of
the
weak
and
needy
but
one
day
at
a
feast
he
killed
by
accident
a
little
boy
in
the
palace
of
oineus
named
eunomos
and
his
heart
was
filled
with
grief
and
he
took
his
wife
deianeira
and
leaving
calydon
he
journeyed
aimlessly
about
until
he
came
to
trachis
in
thessaly
there
he
built
him
a
home
but
his
restless
spirit
would
give
him
no
peace
and
so
leaving
deianeira
in
trachis
he
came
back
towards
argolis
by
way
of
the
sea
three
moons
ago
i
met
him
in
tiryns
he
greeted
me
as
a
dear
old
friend
and
kindly
offered
to
help
me
in
the
undertaking
which
i
had
then
on
foot
for
robbers
had
driven
from
my
pastures
twelve
brood
mares
the
finest
in
all
hellas
and
i
was
searching
for
them
go
you
with
your
men
into
messene
said
he
for
doubtless
you
will
find
that
which
you
seek
among
the
lawless
men
who
own
orsilochus
as
king
if
you
find
them
not
come
again
to
tiryns
and
i
will
aid
you
in
further
search
and
will
have
them
restored
to
you
even
though
hermes
or
great
autolycus
be
the
so
i
left
him
and
came
hither
to
messene
and
to
the
towers
of
pherae
and
thus
you
know
my
errand
which
i
have
kept
hidden
from
orsilochus
i
have
found
no
traces
of
the
stolen
mares
and
so
i
shall
return
to
argolis
and
tiryns
where
the
great
hero
waits
for
me
much
more
would
godlike
iphitus
have
spoken
but
now
the
sun
had
set
and
the
two
friends
hastened
back
to
the
palace
of
orsilochus
never
have
i
met
a
man
whose
friendship
i
prized
more
highly
than
thine
said
odysseus
as
they
crossed
the
courtyard
and
each
was
about
to
retire
to
his
chamber
i
pray
that
thou
wilt
take
this
sharp
sword
which
was
my
father
s
and
this

shall
be
thine
and
shall
be
to
thee
a
worthy
token
of
the
love
which
i
bear
towards
thee
odysseus
took
the
bow
it
was
a
bow
of
marvellous
beauty
and
its
strength
was
so
great
that
no
man
save
its
proud
new
owner
could
string
it
it
was
indeed
a
matchless
gift
and
a
treasure
to
be
prized
xii
most
beautiful
woman
in
the
world
very
early
on
the
following
day
iphitus
bade
orsilochus
farewell
and
started
on
his
journey
back
towards
tiryns
and
odysseus
to
the
surprise
of
all
went
with
him
riding
in
the
same
chariot
i
know
that
you
want
to
go
into
laconia
iphitus
had
said
why
not
go
now
for
i
and
my
brave
men
will
convoy
you
safely
as
far
as
lacedæmon
and
when
there
i
will
commend
you
to
my
old
comrades
castor
and
polydeuces
who
dwell
in
the
palace
of
their
father
king
tyndareus
and
odysseus
had
gladly
consented
for
although
his
host
had
pressed
him
hard
to
stay
longer
he
was
very
anxious
for
many
reasons
to
visit
lacedæmon
for
two
days
the
company
travelled
slowly
eastward
they
crossed
the
mountain
land
which
lies
between
messene
and
laconia
and
came
to
the
plain
rich
with
which
lay
beyond
and
now
the
way
was
easier
and
the
road
led
straight
towards
lacedæmon
at
noon
on
the
second
day
they
rested
upon
the
banks
of
a
little
stream
and
as
the
sun
was
hot
they
sat
a
long
time
in
the
pleasant
shade
of
some
trees
which
grew
not
far
from
the
roadside
some
distance
down
the
valley
they
caught
glimpses
of
the
high
towers
of
the
city
and
now
and
then
they
heard
the
sound
of
busy
workers
within
the
walls
or
the
shouts
of
the
toilers
in
the
neighboring
fields
a
ride
of
only
a
few
minutes
would
bring
them
to
the
gates
of
lacedæmon
while
they
were
thus
waiting
and
resting
an
old
minstrel
who
had
come
out
of
the
city
joined
them
by
the
roadside
and
began
to
entertain
them
at
first
he
played
sweetly
upon
his
lyre
and
sang
songs
new
and
old
which
he
thought
would
be
pleasing
to
his
listeners
then
he
told
them
stories
of
the
times
now
long
past
when
yet
men
lived
in
peaceful
innocence
unbeset
with
eating
cares
and
now
he
said
since
you
are
about
to
enter
lacedæmon
and
will
spend
the
night
within
the
kingly
halls
of
great
tyndareus
you
must
needs
hear
of
the
beauty
and
the
courage
and
the
wealth
for
which
this
city
is
far
famed
among
all
the
states
of
hellas
the
riches
of
which
we
boast
can
not
be
measured
like
gold
and
precious
stones
our
wealth
lies
in
the
courage
and
of
our
men
and
in
the
beauty
and
devotedness
of
our
women
and
then
he
told
them
of
the
four
wonderful
children
whom
king
tyndareus
and
his
wife
leda
had
reared
in
the
pleasant
halls
of
lacedæmon
castor
and
polydeuces
the
devoted
brothers
and
the
sisters
proud
clytemnestra
and
helen
the
beautiful
he
told
how
castor
and
polydeuces
were
famed
among
all
the
heroes
of
greece
how
they
had
sailed
with
jason
on
the
argo
how
they
had
hunted
the
wild
boar
in
the
woods
of
calydon
and
how
they
had
fought
under
the
banner
of
peleus
when
he
stormed
the
town
of
iolcos
and
drove
the
false
acastus
from
his
kingdom
he
told
how
helen
while
yet
a
mere
child
had
been
stolen
from
her
home
and
her
parents
and
carried
by
theseus
of
athens
to
attica
and
how
her
brothers
castor
and
polydeuces
had
rescued
her
and
brought
her
back
to
her
loving
friends
in
lacedæmon
he
told
how
the
two
brothers
excelled
in
all
the
arts
of
war
and
in
feats
of
courage
and
skill
how
castor
was
renowned
at
home
and
abroad
as
a
tamer
of
horses
and
how
polydeuces
was
without
a
peer
as
a
boxer
and
as
a
skilful
wielder
of
the
sword
and
he
told
how
the
beauty
of
helen
had
brought
hosts
of
suitors
from
every
quarter
of
the
world
and
how
her
father
old
tyndareus
was
all
the
time
beset
with
courtiers
princes
and
heroes
the
noblest
of
the
earth
all
beseeching
him
for
the
hand
of
the
matchless
fair
one
no
one
knows
how
long
the
old
man
would
have
kept
on
talking
had
not
iphitus
bade
him
cease
we
have
heard
already
a
thousand
times
the
tales
that
you
tell
us
he
said
waste
no
more
time
with
vain
words
which
are
on
the
tongue
of
every
in
argolis
but
make
haste
back
to
the
city
and
say
to
castor
and
polydeuces
that
iphitus
who
erstwhile
was
their
comrade
on
the
argo
waits
outside
the
gates
of
lacedæmon
the
minstrel
bowed
and
said
it
is
not
for
me
to
act
the
part
of
a
herald
for
a
stranger
but
do
you
send
one
of
your
young
men
into
the
city
and
i
will
gladly
go
with
him
into
the
broad
palace
of
the
king
where
he
may
announce
your
coming
then
iphitus
called
to
one
of
the
young
men
in
his
company
and
bade
him
go
before
them
to
the
palace
to
herald
their
coming
and
the
old
minstrel
went
with
him
now
when
the
sun
was
beginning
to
sink
behind
the
heights
of
lofty
taygetes
the
company
arose
from
their
by
the
roadside
and
began
to
move
slowly
towards
the
city
at
the
same
time
two
horsemen
came
out
through
the
gate
and
rode
rapidly
up
the
valley
to
meet
them
iphitus
waved
his
helmet
in
the
air
and
shouted
aloud
there
they
come
he
cried
the
twin
heroes
as
noble
and
as
handsome
and
seemingly
as
young
as
when
we
sailed
together
on
the
argo
it
seemed
but
a
moment
until
the
horsemen
approached
and
drew
rein
before
them
they
were
tall
and
comely
youths
exceedingly
fair
and
so
alike
that
no
man
could
tell
which
one
was
castor
or
which
polydeuces
their
armor
was
of
gold
and
glowed
in
the
light
of
the
setting
sun
like
on
the
their
steeds
were
white
as
snow
with
long
manes
that
glimmered
and
shone
like
the
silvery
beams
of
the
moon
on
a
still
summer
s
evening
all
hail
our
comrade
they
cried
welcome
to
the
halls
of
lacedæmon
we
bid
you
welcome
in
the
name
of
our
aged
father
king
tyndareus
then
they
turned
and
led
the
way
to
the
lofty
palace
gates
as
odysseus
and
his
aged
friend
dismounted
from
their
car
a
score
of
ready
squires
came
out
to
serve
them
some
loosed
the
horses
from
the
yoke
and
led
them
to
the
stables
and
fed
them
plentifully
with
oats
and
grains
others
tilted
the
car
against
the
wall
of
the
outer
court
so
that
no
careless
would
run
against
or
injure
it
and
still
others
carried
the
arms
of
the
heroes
into
the
spacious
hall
and
leaned
them
with
care
against
the
grooved
columns
then
castor
and
polydeuces
the
glorious
twins
led
the
heroes
into
the
broad
hall
of
king
tyndareus
odysseus
gazed
about
him
with
wondering
eyes
for
he
had
never
seen
so
great
magnificence
walls
of
polished
marble
ran
this
way
and
that
from
the
brazen
threshold
the
doors
were
of
carved
oak
inlaid
with
gold
and
the
were
of
shining
silver
within
were
seats
and
sumptuous
couches
ranged
against
the
wall
from
the
entrance
even
to
the
inner
chambers
and
upon
them
were
spread
light
coverings
woven
and
embroidered
by
the
deft
hands
of
women
and
so
great
was
the
sheen
of
brass
of
gold
and
silver
and
of
precious
gems
within
this
hall
that
the
light
gleamed
from
floor
to
ceiling
like
the
beams
of
the
sun
or
the
round
full
moon
see
note
at
the
end
of
this
volume
the
aged
king
was
pleased
to
see
the
heroes
for
iphitus
and
he
had
been
lifelong
friends
firm
and
true
through
every
turn
of
fortune
and
when
he
learned
the
name
and
parentage
of
young
odysseus
he
took
him
by
the
hand
and
bade
him
welcome
for
the
sake
of
his
father
good
laertes
the
first
words
of
greeting
having
been
spoken
odysseus
still
wondering
went
down
into
the
polished
baths
there
when
he
had
bathed
he
clothed
himself
in
princely
garments
and
he
threw
a
soft
rich
cloak
about
his
shoulders
and
made
himself
ready
to
stand
in
the
presence
of
beauty
nobility
and
courage
then
polydeuces
led
him
back
into
the
great
hall
but
a
change
had
taken
place
while
he
was
gone
the
king
was
no
longer
alone
there
stood
around
him
or
sat
upon
couches
all
the
noblest
young
heroes
of
hellas
the
king
s
tall
agamemnon
of
mycenæ
stood
behind
the
throne
and
near
him
was
his
handsome
brother
menelaus
among
all
the
princes
then
at
lacedæmon
these
two
sons
of
atreus
were
accounted
worthiest
for
not
only
did
they
excel
in
strength
and
wisdom
but
they
were
heirs
to
the
kingdom
of
argolis
and
the
lordship
over
men
next
to
them
stood
ajax
the
son
of
telamon
he
was
nephew
to
old
king
peleus
who
had
wedded
the
in
the
of
mount
pelion
and
among
the
younger
heroes
there
was
none
who
equalled
him
in
bravery
reclining
on
a
couch
at
the
king
s
left
hand
was
another
prince
of
the
same
name
ajax
the
son
of
oileus
he
had
come
from
distant
locris
where
he
was
noted
as
the
swiftest
runner
and
the
most
skilful
spearsman
in
all
hellas
he
was
neither
so
tall
nor
so
handsome
as
the
son
of
telamon
but
the
very
glance
of
his
eye
and
the
curl
of
his
lip
made
men
admire
and
love
him
below
him
stood
diomede
of
tiryns
who
though
still
a
mere
youth
was
a
very
lion
in
war
his
father
brave
tydeus
had
met
his
death
while
fighting
with
the
thebans
but
he
had
long
ago
avenged
him
idomeneus
a
prince
of
crete
known
far
and
wide
for
his
skill
in
wielding
the
spear
was
next
a
man
already
past
the
prime
of
life
and
beyond
him
in
order
were
other
princes
philoctetes
of
melibœa
famous
for
his
archery
machaon
son
of
asclepius
from
œchalia
the
home
of
iphitus
antilochus
of
pylos
late
the
companion
of
odysseus
nireus
of
syma
famed
only
for
his
comeliness
and
menestheus
of
athens
who
in
the
management
of
men
and
horses
and
the
ordering
of
battle
had
not
a
peer
on
earth
all
these
were
in
the
hall
of
king
tyndareus
and
they
received
odysseus
with
words
of
seeming
kindness
although
a
shade
of
jealousy
was
plainly
seen
upon
their
faces
while
they
were
speaking
a
minstrel
entered
and
began
to
play
deftly
upon
his
lyre
and
as
he
played
and
sung
two
dancers
sprang
upon
the
floor
and
whirled
in
giddy
mazes
about
the
hall
then
from
their
chamber
where
the
air
was
full
of
sweet
perfumes
came
three
women
to
listen
to
the
music
helen
like
in
form
to
artemis
the
led
the
rest
and
when
odysseus
saw
her
he
remembered
no
more
the
golden
splendor
which
had
dazzled
his
eyes
when
first
he
stood
upon
the
threshold
of
the
palace
for
every
thing
else
paled
in
the
light
of
helen
s
unspeakable
beauty
next
to
her
came
clytemnestra
who
a
few
years
before
had
been
wedded
to
agamemnon
of
mycenæ
she
was
fair
but
not
beautiful
and
the
glance
which
fell
from
her
eye
sent
a
thrill
of
pain
to
the
heart
of
the
young
hero
the
two
sisters
were
followed
by
their
cousin
sweet
penelope
who
blushing
like
the
morning
kept
her
eyes
modestly
upon
the
ground
and
looked
not
once
towards
the
company
of
princely
strangers
and
as
she
stood
leaning
against
a
lofty
column
odysseus
wondered
within
himself
whether
he
admired
more
the
glorious
beauty
of
helen
or
the
retiring
sweetness
of
penelope
xiii
race
for
a
wife
days
and
weeks
passed
by
and
still
odysseus
tarried
as
a
guest
at
the
court
of
king
tyndareus
his
friend
iphitus
had
gone
on
to
tiryns
to
meet
the
hero
heracles
and
had
left
with
him
his
blessing
and
the
bow
of
eurytus
but
the
young
princes
who
had
come
to
lacedæmon
to
woo
the
beautiful
helen
remained
in
the
palace
and
each
had
vowed
in
the
secret
of
his
heart
that
he
would
not
depart
until
he
had
won
the
matchless
lady
for
his
bride
each
had
offered
to
the
king
gifts
of
countless
value
gold
and
jewels
fine
horses
and
armor
and
each
had
prayed
him
that
he
would
himself
set
the
for
his
daughter
and
bestow
her
on
whom
he
would
even
on
the
man
who
pleased
him
best
but
the
king
for
reasons
of
his
own
would
give
them
no
answer
all
this
time
odysseus
held
himself
aloof
from
the
crowd
of
wooers
and
kept
his
own
counsel
and
though
all
believed
that
he
too
was
smitten
with
love
for
the
peerless
helen
yet
in
his
heart
the
penelope
reigned
queen
one
day
as
he
sat
alone
with
tyndareus
in
his
chamber
he
saw
that
the
king
was
sorely
troubled
and
he
began
in
his
own
way
to
find
out
the
cause
of
his
distress
illustration
odysseus
advises
king
tyndareus
concerning
helen
s
suitors
surely
o
king
he
said
you
are
the
happiest
of
men
for
here
you
have
in
lacedæmon
every
thing
that
can
delight
the
eye
or
please
the
heart
wherever
you
may
turn
there
you
see
wealth
and
beauty
and
it
is
all
yours
to
do
with
as
you
like
your
sons
are
the
bravest
in
the
world
your
daughters
are
the
fairest
your
palace
is
the
most
beautiful
your
kingdom
is
the
strongest
there
is
certainly
nothing
to
be
wished
for
that
is
not
already
yours
and
yet
answered
tyndareus
with
a
sigh
i
am
the
most
miserable
of
mortals
i
would
rather
be
a
witless
swineherd
in
the
oak
forests
living
in
a
hut
and
feeding
upon
roots
and
wild
fruits
than
dwell
in
this
palace
beset
with
cares
like
those
which
daily
weigh
me
down
i
can
not
understand
you
said
odysseus
you
are
at
peace
with
all
the
world
your
children
are
all
with
you
you
have
no
lack
of
comfort
there
is
nothing
more
for
you
to
desire
how
indeed
can
care
come
in
through
these
golden
doors
and
sit
upon
your
brow
and
weigh
you
down
with
heaviness
i
will
tell
you
answered
the
king
for
i
know
that
i
can
trust
your
good
judgment
here
in
my
palace
are
all
the
noblest
princes
of
hellas
suing
for
the
hand
of
helen
whom
the
gods
have
cursed
with
more
than
mortal
beauty
each
has
offered
me
a
price
and
each
expects
to
win
her
i
dare
not
withhold
her
long
for
then
all
will
become
angered
and
my
kingdom
as
well
as
my
daughter
will
be
the
prey
of
him
who
is
the
strongest
i
dare
not
give
her
to
one
of
them
for
then
the
other
nine
and
twenty
will
make
cause
against
me
and
bring
ruin
to
lacedæmon
on
this
side
grin
the
heads
of
scylla
all
black
with
death
on
that
side
dread
charybdis
roars
and
there
is
no
middle
way
why
oh
why
did
not
the
immortals
bless
my
daughter
by
giving
her
a
homely
face
then
odysseus
drew
nearer
to
the
king
and
spoke
in
lower
tones
i
pray
you
do
not
despair
he
said
there
is
a
safe
way
out
of
all
this
trouble
if
you
will
only
trust
me
i
will
lead
the
whole
matter
to
a
happy
issue
how
how
eagerly
asked
the
king
i
will
tell
you
said
odysseus
but
you
must
first
listen
to
a
plea
that
i
have
to
make
to
you
alone
it
is
known
that
i
am
not
a
suitor
for
the
hand
of
helen
but
that
my
hopes
are
all
for
coy
penelope
speak
to
her
father
your
brother
icarius
and
help
me
win
her
for
my
own
and
i
will
settle
this
matter
between
you
and
the
princely
lovers
of
fair
helen
in
a
manner
pleasing
to
every
one
it
shall
be
as
you
wish
cried
the
king
taking
heart
i
will
trust
the
management
of
this
business
to
you
and
may
the
wise
pallas
athené
prosper
you
the
next
morning
shrewd
odysseus
arose
and
clothed
himself
in
princely
fashion
and
after
the
morning
meal
had
been
eaten
he
bade
the
heralds
call
the
suitors
into
the
council
chamber
and
the
heralds
called
the
gathering
and
the
young
heroes
quickly
came
one
after
another
until
nine
and
twenty
sat
within
the
chamber
where
the
elders
of
lacedæmon
were
wont
to
meet
then
odysseus
stood
on
the
raised
platform
close
to
the
door
and
pallas
athené
unseen
by
the
dull
eyes
of
mortals
stood
beside
him
and
whispered
words
of
wisdom
in
his
ear
noble
men
of
hellas
said
odysseus
i
pray
that
you
will
hearken
to
the
words
which
i
shall
speak
and
that
you
will
duly
weigh
them
in
your
minds
we
have
all
come
to
lacedæmon
with
one
wish
and
one
intent
and
that
is
to
win
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
the
world
we
have
offered
each
one
for
himself
a
worthy
of
the
bride
yet
the
king
for
reasons
which
you
ought
to
understand
is
slow
in
bestowing
her
upon
any
of
us
and
so
weeks
and
even
months
have
passed
and
we
are
still
here
devouring
the
substance
of
our
kind
host
and
yet
as
far
as
ever
from
the
prize
which
we
desire
now
it
behooves
us
to
bring
this
matter
to
an
end
for
otherwise
we
all
shall
suffer
loss
by
being
too
long
absent
from
our
homes
the
princely
suitors
listened
kindly
to
his
words
and
all
nodded
their
assent
then
he
went
on
upon
how
many
of
you
now
has
the
peerless
helen
smiled
as
if
in
admiration
every
man
among
them
raised
his
hand
in
answer
who
among
you
all
believes
that
fair
helen
would
prefer
him
above
every
other
for
a
husband
every
man
arose
and
glancing
proudly
around
him
answered
i
i
have
then
a
plan
to
offer
said
odysseus
let
us
leave
the
choice
to
helen
and
in
order
that
each
may
the
better
show
whether
there
be
aught
of
nobility
in
him
let
us
go
forth
straightway
and
make
trial
of
all
the
games
in
which
any
one
of
us
excels
and
when
the
games
are
ended
let
glorious
helen
come
and
choose
him
whom
she
will
at
this
all
the
suitors
shouted
assent
for
each
felt
sure
that
he
would
be
the
chosen
one
but
hearken
to
one
word
more
cried
odysseus
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
the
world
is
a
prize
of
priceless
value
and
he
who
wins
that
prize
will
hardly
keep
it
through
the
might
of
his
unaided
arm
let
us
bind
ourselves
by
an
oath
that
he
whom
helen
chooses
shall
be
her
wedded
husband
and
that
the
rest
will
depart
at
once
from
lacedæmon
and
that
if
any
man
from
near
or
far
shall
carry
peerless
helen
from
her
husband
or
her
husband
s
home
then
we
will
join
our
forces
and
never
falter
in
the
fight
until
we
have
restored
her
to
him
and
further
still
added
ajax
telamon
let
us
swear
that
should
any
one
of
us
forget
the
agreement
made
this
day
then
the
remaining
nine
and
twenty
will
cause
swift
punishment
and
terrible
to
fall
upon
him
much
more
did
shrewd
odysseus
and
the
assembled
princes
say
and
in
the
end
they
made
a
solemn
sacrifice
to
father
zeus
and
lifting
up
their
hands
they
swore
that
they
would
hold
to
all
that
had
been
spoken
then
at
an
hour
which
had
been
set
they
went
out
to
make
trial
of
their
skill
in
all
kinds
of
manly
games
so
that
each
might
show
wherein
he
excelled
all
other
men
and
thus
stand
higher
in
the
regards
of
matchless
helen
and
the
heralds
made
announcement
and
a
great
company
followed
them
to
the
broad
between
the
palace
and
the
city
walls
king
tyndareus
happy
that
his
perplexities
were
soon
to
end
sat
upon
a
high
throne
overlooking
the
place
and
at
his
side
stood
the
glorious
twins
castor
and
polydeuces
clad
in
their
armor
but
helen
dowered
with
beauty
by
the
gods
stood
with
her
maidens
at
the
window
of
her
chamber
and
watched
the
contest
from
afar
then
all
the
suitors
arrayed
in
princely
garments
as
became
the
mightiest
men
of
hellas
stood
up
in
the
lists
each
for
himself
to
take
his
part
in
the
games
and
each
fondly
believed
that
he
among
them
all
was
the
favored
suitor
of
fair
helen
but
shrewd
odysseus
kept
his
own
counsels
and
wisely
planned
to
reach
the
ends
which
he
so
much
desired
then
the
games
began
and
they
made
trial
first
in
throwing
the
heavy
spear
and
idomeneus
led
all
the
rest
then
in
shooting
with
the
bow
and
odysseus
was
far
the
best
for
no
one
else
could
string
or
handle
the
matchless
bow
of
eurytus
then
in
throwing
heavy
weights
and
ajax
son
of
telamon
sent
a
huge
stone
hurtling
from
his
strong
arms
far
beyond
all
other
marks
then
in
wrestling
and
there
was
not
one
that
could
withstand
the
son
of
oileus
then
in
boxing
and
philoctetes
the
of
heracles
carried
off
the
palm
then
in
fencing
with
the
and
diomede
held
the
championship
and
found
no
peer
then
in
leaping
and
thoas
of
ætolia
one
of
the
later
comers
excelled
all
others
then
in
the
and
here
again
the
lesser
ajax
left
all
the
rest
behind
and
now
the
car
of
helios
was
sloping
towards
the
western
sea
and
king
tyndareus
by
a
signal
ordered
that
the
games
should
cease
come
my
friends
said
he
the
day
is
spent
and
nothing
can
be
gained
by
further
trials
of
strength
and
skill
let
us
go
forthwith
to
my
banquet
hall
where
the
tables
groan
already
with
the
weight
of
the
good
cheer
which
has
been
provided
for
you
and
when
you
have
rested
yourselves
and
put
away
from
you
the
thought
of
hunger
fair
helen
will
descend
from
her
high
chamber
and
choose
from
among
you
him
who
shall
be
her
husband
and
all
obeyed
and
went
straightway
to
the
great
banquet
hall
of
the
king
now
the
court
and
the
hall
and
even
the
of
the
palace
were
thronged
with
people
old
and
young
noble
and
for
all
had
heard
of
what
was
to
follow
and
the
steward
of
the
king
had
slain
a
score
of
sheep
and
many
swine
and
two
oxen
and
these
he
had
flayed
and
dressed
for
the
goodly
banquet
then
all
sat
down
at
the
tables
and
stretching
forth
their
hands
they
partook
of
the
pleasant
food
so
bounteously
spread
before
them
and
though
some
of
the
princely
suitors
had
been
beaten
in
the
games
yet
all
were
merry
and
hopeful
and
many
a
pleasant
jest
was
bandied
back
and
forth
among
them
the
son
of
oileus
should
remember
said
nireus
that
the
race
is
not
always
to
the
swift
and
nireus
should
remember
said
thoas
that
beauty
does
not
consort
with
comeliness
aphrodite
did
not
choose
apollo
for
her
husband
but
rather
the
limping
smith
hephaestus
then
some
one
asked
nireus
what
was
the
price
of
in
syma
and
this
led
to
much
merriment
and
many
jokes
about
his
smooth
curls
his
face
and
his
doublet
if
his
father
were
living
said
one
he
would
be
setting
a
upon
him
in
the
midst
of
the
merriment
a
herald
passed
through
the
hall
crying
out
remember
your
oaths
o
princes
of
the
hellenes
remember
your
promises
to
the
immortal
gods
a
silence
fell
upon
that
multitude
like
the
stillness
which
takes
hold
upon
all
nature
when
waiting
for
the
to
vent
its
fury
upon
the
plains
and
the
minstrel
who
sat
upon
a
raised
seat
at
the
farther
side
of
the
hall
touched
his
harp
with
his
deft
fingers
and
brought
forth
sounds
so
sweet
and
low
and
musical
that
the
ears
of
all
the
hearers
were
entranced
then
the
door
of
the
inner
chamber
opened
and
the
glorious
helen
leaning
on
the
arm
of
old
tyndareus
came
forth
to
make
her
choice
the
hearts
of
all
the
suitors
stood
still
they
could
not
bear
to
look
toward
her
although
her
heavenly
beauty
was
modestly
hidden
beneath
her
thick
veil
she
came
into
the
hall
she
passed
idomeneus
who
sat
nearest
the
inner
chamber
she
passed
the
mighty
ajax
him
of
the
noble
form
and
the
eagle
eye
she
passed
the
doughty
diomede
wielder
of
the
sword
she
passed
philoctetes
and
odysseus
and
the
son
of
oileus
the
hearts
of
the
younger
suitors
on
the
hither
side
of
the
hall
began
to
beat
with
high
hopes
she
surely
has
her
eyes
on
me
said
the
coxcomb
nireus
speaking
to
himself
she
came
to
the
table
where
menelaus
the
brother
of
agamemnon
sat
she
paused
a
moment
and
then
she
held
out
her
hand
in
token
that
he
was
the
husband
of
her
choice
the
great
silence
was
at
once
broken
and
a
mighty
shout
went
up
to
the
high
roof
of
the
palace
every
one
of
the
slighted
suitors
felt
for
an
instant
the
keen
pang
of
disappointment
then
remembering
their
oaths
all
joined
in
wishing
joy
to
menelaus
and
his
bride
some
however
chagrined
and
crestfallen
soon
withdrew
from
the
palace
and
calling
their
servitors
about
them
they
secretly
and
in
haste
departed
from
lacedæmon
when
the
morning
dawned
only
ten
of
the
young
princes
still
staid
in
the
halls
of
old
tyndareus
it
was
easy
to
understand
why
these
remained
penelope
had
won
other
hearts
beside
that
of
young
odysseus
since
the
glorious
helen
is
to
be
the
bride
of
menelaus
said
each
of
those
who
tarried
why
shall
not
her
fair
cousin
who
is
worthier
if
not
so
beautiful
be
mine
to
wed
and
straightway
they
beset
icarius
with
offers
of
rich
gifts
begging
him
to
set
a
on
his
daughter
and
bestow
her
upon
him
who
should
agree
most
willingly
to
pay
it
the
old
man
was
sorely
troubled
for
he
loved
his
daughter
dearly
and
he
could
not
bear
the
thought
that
a
strange
prince
should
lead
her
into
distant
lands
where
perchance
his
eyes
should
never
more
behold
her
while
he
pondered
sadly
sitting
alone
and
bewildered
in
his
chamber
he
heard
a
minstrel
singing
in
the
hall
he
listened
it
was
a
song
about
atalanta
the
fair
huntress
of
arcadia
beginning
with
the
time
when
meleager
of
the
golden
hair
awarded
her
the
prize
in
the
wood
of
calydon
then
the
minstrel
sang
of
the
maiden
s
return
to
arcadia
how
she
had
stopped
at
delphi
on
her
way
and
had
asked
the
pythia
in
apollo
s
temple
to
reveal
the
secrets
of
her
future
life
how
the
oracle
could
tell
her
nothing
of
the
things
that
would
befall
her
but
only
gave
her
this
advice
keep
thyself
from
wedlock
s
chains
how
when
she
came
again
to
her
father
s
palace
she
found
him
beset
by
suitors
asking
for
the
hand
of
his
daughter
then
the
maiden
calling
to
mind
the
pythia
s
warning
besought
her
father
to
send
the
suitors
home
and
let
her
like
artemis
live
unwedded
for
she
would
be
as
free
as
the
winds
which
play
in
the
lovely
vales
of
mantinea
or
beat
the
bleak
tops
of
mount
enispe
but
old
iasus
was
a
crafty
man
an
unfeeling
father
loving
gold
more
than
his
daughter
behold
said
he
the
that
is
offered
shall
i
refuse
so
great
gain
simply
to
please
thy
silly
whims
then
atalanta
was
sorely
troubled
and
she
prayed
artemis
the
to
send
her
help
in
the
time
of
her
great
need
and
artemis
hearkened
and
spoke
words
of
comfort
to
her
heart
and
kind
pallas
athené
gave
her
wisdom
my
father
said
she
to
old
iasus
take
thou
the
that
any
suitor
may
offer
for
me
but
on
these
conditions
that
he
shall
make
trial
with
me
in
the
and
if
he
outrun
me
then
i
will
go
with
him
as
his
bride
but
if
i
outstrip
him
in
the
race
then
he
is
to
lose
the
offered
and
his
life
is
to
be
at
your
mercy
crafty
iasus
was
highly
pleased
and
he
rubbed
his
palms
together
with
delight
and
he
caused
the
heralds
to
proclaim
the
terms
on
which
the
matchless
atalanta
might
be
won
some
of
the
suitors
departed
in
despair
for
they
knew
that
no
mortal
man
was
so
fleet
of
foot
as
the
lovely
huntress
of
arcadia
but
many
others
less
wise
put
themselves
in
training
for
the
trial
then
one
by
one
like
silly
moths
plunging
into
the
candle
s
flame
they
went
down
to
the
of
old
iasus
and
tried
their
speed
with
that
of
the
damsel
but
all
failed
miserably
and
none
of
them
ever
returned
to
their
homes
or
their
loving
friends
and
iasus
grew
rich
upon
the
spoils
the
jewels
and
the
and
the
arms
which
he
thus
gained
from
the
luckless
lovers
one
day
milanion
a
youth
from
distant
scandia
came
to
try
his
fortune
knowest
thou
the
terms
asked
iasus
i
know
them
was
the
answer
and
though
they
were
thrice
as
hard
yet
would
i
win
atalanta
and
atalanta
when
she
saw
his
manly
handsome
face
and
heard
his
pleasant
voice
was
sad
to
think
that
one
so
noble
and
so
brave
should
meet
so
hard
a
fate
but
milanion
went
down
to
the
with
a
firm
step
and
a
heart
full
of
hope
for
he
had
prayed
to
aphrodite
that
she
would
kindly
aid
his
suit
and
lend
him
wings
to
reach
the
goal
in
advance
of
atalanta
and
aphrodite
had
listened
to
his
plea
and
had
given
him
three
golden
apples
and
had
whispered
a
secret
in
his
ear
the
signal
was
given
and
youth
and
maiden
bounded
from
the
lists
like
arrows
shot
from
a
bow
but
the
maiden
was
much
the
fleeter
of
the
two
and
was
soon
far
in
advance
another
fool
will
soon
come
to
grief
said
iasus
laughing
loudly
by
this
time
atalanta
was
near
the
while
milanion
straining
every
nerve
was
many
yards
behind
then
he
remembered
the
secret
which
aphrodite
had
whispered
and
he
threw
one
of
the
golden
apples
far
beyond
the
post
it
fell
upon
the
green
lawn
a
stone
outside
of
the
course
the
quick
eyes
of
atalanta
marked
its
beauty
and
she
ran
to
pick
it
up
and
while
she
was
seeking
it
among
the
grass
milanion
passed
the
and
was
speeding
swiftly
back
towards
the
goal
it
was
only
a
moment
however
until
atalanta
swift
as
the
wind
overtook
him
and
was
again
far
in
the
lead
then
the
young
man
threw
a
second
apple
this
time
some
distance
to
the
right
of
the
course
the
maiden
followed
catching
it
almost
before
it
fell
but
milanion
had
gained
a
hundred
paces
on
her
ere
she
could
again
overtake
him
he
threw
his
third
apple
over
his
shoulder
and
to
the
left
of
the
course
atalanta
forgetting
in
her
eagerness
that
the
goal
was
so
near
stopped
to
secure
this
prize
also
and
lo
as
she
lifted
her
eyes
milanion
had
reached
the
end
of
the
course
old
iasus
stormed
with
rage
and
threatened
many
fearful
things
but
milanion
smiling
came
boldly
forward
and
claimed
his
bride
and
she
blushing
and
happy
covered
her
face
with
her
veil
and
followed
him
willingly
to
the
home
of
his
fathers
in
distant
cythera
such
was
the
song
which
the
minstrel
sang
and
to
which
icarius
listened
while
sitting
in
his
chamber
suddenly
a
new
thought
seemed
to
strike
him
and
he
bade
a
herald
call
before
him
all
the
suitors
of
sweet
penelope
my
young
friends
he
said
you
have
asked
me
for
my
daughter
s
hand
and
promised
me
a
liberal
i
need
none
of
your
gold
nor
do
i
wish
to
give
my
daughter
to
a
stranger
with
whom
she
would
be
loath
to
go
hence
i
shall
do
after
this
manner
he
who
shall
win
in
a
on
the
long
course
beyond
the
shall
be
husband
of
penelope
but
on
this
condition
that
if
she
choose
to
go
with
him
then
he
is
to
have
her
without
the
payment
of
a
price
but
if
she
choose
to
stay
with
me
then
he
shall
pay
me
a
rich
dower
and
straightway
depart
forever
from
the
gates
of
lacedæmon
the
suitors
heard
the
words
of
old
icarius
and
all
assented
then
soon
the
people
were
gathered
again
in
the
broad
the
long
was
cleared
and
put
in
order
and
every
thing
was
made
ready
for
the
trial
the
trumpet
sounded
and
the
young
princes
came
forward
lightly
clad
for
the
race
palamedes
the
cousin
of
menelaus
fair
and
tall
and
ajax
oileus
who
had
won
the
race
on
the
preceding
day
and
megas
brave
as
mars
from
far
dulichium
and
thoas
the
ætolian
prince
and
phidippus
the
grandson
of
great
heracles
and
protesilaus
from
distant
thessaly
and
eumelus
son
of
admetus
and
the
divine
alcestis
and
polypoetes
descended
from
the
lapith
king
peirithous
and
hippodameia
the
daughter
of
the
centaurs
and
elphenor
the
son
of
chalcodon
ruler
of
eubœa
and
the
valorous
abantes
and
lastly
odysseus
who
had
shrewdly
planned
all
matters
to
this
end
rarely
have
ten
men
so
noble
stood
up
together
to
contend
for
honors
or
the
winner
s
prize
the
word
was
given
and
they
darted
forth
at
once
and
swiftly
raising
a
cloud
of
dust
along
the
course
from
the
very
start
they
strained
at
utmost
speed
they
reached
the
and
hurried
onward
to
the
goal
but
now
stout
ajax
no
longer
took
the
lead
for
odysseus
ran
before
the
rest
and
passed
the
goal
and
came
to
the
crowd
by
the
lists
while
yet
the
others
with
laboring
breath
were
speeding
down
the
course
old
icarius
was
pleased
with
the
issue
of
the
race
for
he
hoped
that
penelope
would
not
consent
to
wed
odysseus
and
follow
him
to
distant
ithaca
and
if
so
he
would
be
happily
rid
of
all
the
troublesome
suitors
come
here
my
sweet
daughter
he
said
this
young
man
a
stranger
from
a
land
has
won
thee
in
the
games
yet
the
choice
is
thine
wilt
thou
leave
thy
old
father
lonely
and
alone
in
lacedæmon
preferring
to
share
the
fortunes
of
this
stranger
or
wilt
thou
stay
with
me
and
bid
him
seek
a
wife
among
the
daughters
of
his
own
people
and
sweet
penelope
covered
her
face
with
her
veil
to
hide
her
blushes
and
said
he
is
my
husband
i
will
go
with
him
icarius
said
no
more
but
on
that
spot
he
after
wards
raised
a
marble
statue
a
statue
of
penelope
veiling
her
blushes
and
he
dedicated
it
to
modesty
soon
afterward
odysseus
returned
with
his
young
wife
to
his
own
home
and
friends
in
ithaca
and
next
to
penelope
the
richest
treasure
that
he
carried
thither
was
the
bow
of
eurytus
xiv
a
great
hero
met
his
master
now
after
two
years
and
more
had
passed
in
peace
there
came
one
day
to
ithaca
an
aged
wanderer
who
had
many
things
of
great
import
to
tell
for
he
had
been
in
every
land
and
in
every
clime
and
had
trod
the
streets
of
every
city
even
from
pylos
to
iolcos
by
the
sea
and
he
knew
what
deeds
had
been
done
by
all
the
heroes
and
what
fortunes
or
misfortunes
had
befallen
mankind
in
every
part
of
hellas
and
odysseus
and
the
elders
of
ithaca
loved
to
sit
around
him
in
the
banquet
chamber
of
laertes
and
listen
to
his
stories
of
which
there
was
no
end
for
in
that
wonderful
golden
age
these
strollers
blind
bards
and
were
the
people
s
newspapers
and
oftentimes
the
only
means
by
which
those
of
one
country
could
learn
aught
of
what
was
passing
in
another
alas
the
world
is
no
longer
as
it
was
in
the
days
of
my
youth
said
the
old
newsmonger
one
morning
with
a
sigh
the
heroes
are
all
passing
away
indeed
of
the
older
race
i
can
now
remember
only
three
who
are
still
living
peleus
the
king
of
the
myrmidons
nestor
of
lordly
pylos
and
laertes
in
whose
halls
we
are
sitting
you
forget
cheiron
the
wise
master
said
odysseus
by
no
means
was
the
answer
it
is
now
seven
years
since
zeus
took
him
from
earth
and
set
him
among
the
stars
some
say
that
heracles
while
fighting
with
unfriendly
centaurs
unwittingly
struck
the
great
master
with
one
of
his
poisoned
arrows
others
say
that
the
master
while
looking
at
an
arrow
carelessly
dropped
it
upon
his
own
foot
thus
wounding
himself
unto
death
but
who
is
right
i
can
not
tell
i
only
know
that
cheiron
lives
no
longer
in
his
on
rugged
pelion
and
that
the
old
heroes
are
all
fast
following
him
to
the
land
of
the
unknown
but
what
of
neleus
the
old
father
of
nestor
and
what
of
my
dear
friend
iphitus
of
œchalia
and
what
of
great
heracles
surely
the
race
of
heroes
still
lives
in
them
can
it
be
that
you
have
not
heard
the
sad
story
asked
the
old
man
can
it
be
that
no
one
has
yet
brought
to
you
the
strange
news
over
which
all
hellas
has
been
weeping
two
harvests
now
have
passed
since
the
noble
spirit
of
iphitus
fled
down
the
dark
ways
it
may
be
to
the
gloomy
halls
of
hades
it
may
be
to
the
of
rhadamanthus
in
the
islands
of
the
blest
and
old
neleus
followed
swiftly
in
his
footsteps
his
feeble
life
snuffed
out
by
the
mad
hand
of
heracles
nor
did
great
heracles
himself
long
survive
the
evil
deed
and
the
wrath
of
the
eternal
powers
but
now
he
sits
enthroned
on
high
olympus
and
walks
the
earth
no
more
pray
tell
us
how
it
all
came
about
said
king
laertes
anxiously
then
the
old
prefacing
his
story
with
a
sad
wild
song
told
how
the
greatest
hero
of
the
golden
age
met
at
last
his
master
even
death
the
master
of
all
earth
s
creatures
and
this
was
the
story
that
he
told
when
heracles
fled
from
calydon
as
you
already
know
he
went
to
trachis
in
thessaly
close
by
the
springs
of
œta
and
there
he
abode
a
long
time
yet
his
mind
was
ill
at
rest
and
dire
forebodings
filled
his
soul
for
cruel
here
was
threatening
him
with
madness
such
as
had
once
before
darkened
his
life
and
driven
him
to
deeds
too
terrible
to
think
upon
and
so
at
length
he
kissed
his
dear
wife
and
his
lovely
babes
and
went
forth
to
wander
once
more
in
loneliness
from
land
to
land
he
knew
that
he
would
not
return
and
unknown
to
deianeira
he
left
in
his
dwelling
a
letter
such
as
men
write
when
they
feel
that
the
end
is
drawing
nigh
in
it
he
told
how
the
doves
in
the
old
oaks
of
dodona
had
shown
him
that
within
the
space
of
a
year
and
three
months
he
should
depart
from
this
earth
and
then
he
gave
directions
how
his
goods
should
be
given
to
his
children
and
his
friends
and
what
they
should
do
to
hold
his
memory
in
honor
after
this
he
took
ship
and
came
by
sea
to
his
old
home
at
tiryns
where
erstwhile
he
had
served
his
brother
and
eurystheus
there
he
sojourned
many
days
and
there
he
met
iphitus
of
œchalia
his
friend
in
early
youth
seeking
twelve
horses
of
great
worth
and
beauty
which
had
been
stolen
from
him
go
you
to
pherae
in
messene
said
heracles
his
mind
even
then
verging
towards
madness
it
may
be
that
the
beasts
have
been
taken
by
the
lawless
men
of
that
country
for
they
live
by
robbery
but
if
you
fail
to
find
your
horses
there
come
again
to
tiryns
and
report
to
me
and
then
i
will
aid
you
even
though
we
should
have
to
seek
them
in
the
pasture
lands
of
old
autolycus
beneath
the
shadow
of
so
iphitus
with
a
score
of
his
bravest
followers
went
down
into
messene
and
laconia
and
even
to
the
gates
of
lacedæmon
looking
for
his
horses
but
he
found
no
traces
of
the
beasts
and
in
time
he
came
again
to
tiryns
as
the
great
hero
had
directed
him
sad
however
was
the
day
of
his
return
for
the
mind
of
heracles
was
shrouded
in
deep
darkness
while
iphitus
sat
as
a
guest
at
his
table
the
mighty
son
of
zeus
arose
in
his
madness
and
slew
him
and
heracles
cared
not
for
the
vengeance
of
the
gods
nor
for
the
honor
of
his
own
board
moreover
the
goodly
horses
of
iphitus
were
even
then
feeding
in
his
stables
at
tiryns
for
heracles
himself
had
found
them
but
after
this
the
light
began
to
struggle
feebly
in
his
mind
and
the
thought
of
his
crime
bore
heavily
upon
him
then
he
remembered
old
neleus
the
most
ancient
of
men
and
knew
that
he
sat
in
the
at
pylos
dealing
out
justice
to
all
who
came
to
him
and
straightway
he
went
by
the
nearest
road
to
pylos
and
besought
neleus
the
venerable
to
purify
him
for
the
evil
deed
that
he
had
done
but
iphitus
and
his
father
old
eurytus
had
been
very
dear
to
neleus
comrades
and
friends
indeed
in
the
stirring
days
of
their
youth
the
blood
of
good
iphitus
be
upon
you
said
the
old
man
to
heracles
and
he
would
not
purify
him
neither
would
he
comfort
him
with
words
of
kindness
then
madness
again
overpowered
the
great
hero
and
in
his
wrath
he
marched
through
pylos
breathing
slaughter
and
he
slew
old
neleus
in
the
and
put
his
sons
and
the
elders
of
pylos
to
the
sword
sparing
only
the
knightly
nestor
most
discreet
of
men
but
the
fury
of
the
great
hero
was
not
to
run
unchecked
the
powers
can
never
look
with
favor
upon
that
man
who
slays
his
guest
in
his
halls
or
who
deals
harshly
with
old
age
and
so
they
caused
heracles
to
be
sold
to
omphalé
queen
of
lydia
to
serve
her
as
a
for
a
year
and
a
day
and
in
that
land
he
toiled
at
many
a
thankless
task
until
the
days
of
his
bondage
were
ended
yet
the
great
cloud
was
only
a
little
way
lifted
from
his
mind
and
he
thought
to
himself
that
all
the
misery
that
had
ever
been
his
had
come
upon
him
through
the
house
of
eurytus
so
he
swore
with
a
great
oath
that
when
he
had
gotten
his
freedom
he
would
utterly
destroy
œchalia
and
would
sell
all
its
people
into
bondage
for
in
a
dazed
unreasoning
way
he
remembered
fair
iole
and
the
slight
which
eurytus
had
put
upon
him
when
he
made
trial
of
his
skill
in
archery
now
when
he
was
set
free
he
remembered
all
too
well
the
vow
which
he
had
made
and
when
he
had
overthrown
œchalia
and
had
taken
captive
all
the
fair
women
and
children
he
bethought
him
that
he
would
go
again
to
trachis
where
his
wife
and
children
still
dwelt
but
on
his
way
thither
he
stopped
for
a
time
in
eubœa
to
offer
sacrifice
to
zeus
and
he
sent
his
herald
lichas
on
before
him
with
certain
of
the
captives
when
lichas
came
to
trachis
and
made
himself
known
to
deianeira
she
asked
him
what
word
he
had
brought
from
heracles
his
master
he
is
alive
and
well
said
the
herald
and
he
tarries
for
a
while
in
eubœa
to
build
an
altar
to
zeus
why
does
he
do
that
asked
deianeira
he
does
it
to
fulfil
a
vow
answered
the
herald
a
vow
which
he
made
ere
yet
he
had
overthrown
œchalia
and
had
led
captive
these
fair
women
whom
thou
then
deianeira
drew
nearer
and
looked
with
pity
upon
the
captives
as
they
stood
in
sad
array
on
the
shore
of
the
desolate
sea
and
she
lifted
her
hands
toward
heaven
and
prayed
that
the
great
powers
would
keep
her
from
such
a
fate
and
would
shield
her
children
that
so
sad
an
evil
should
never
overtake
them
then
she
saw
that
one
among
the
captives
was
much
more
beautiful
than
the
others
tall
and
very
fair
with
long
golden
tresses
and
eyes
as
round
as
the
moon
and
as
blue
as
the
deep
sea
and
deianeira
wondering
whether
she
were
not
some
great
man
s
daughter
asked
her
who
she
was
but
the
sad
captive
answered
not
a
word
the
tender
heart
of
the
queen
was
filled
with
pity
and
she
bade
that
the
beautiful
lady
should
be
taken
into
the
great
hall
of
heracles
and
treated
with
the
utmost
kindness
that
so
she
should
not
have
sorrow
heaped
upon
sorrow
then
she
asked
lichas
to
tell
her
who
the
lady
was
but
he
said
that
he
knew
not
save
that
she
seemed
to
be
well
born
but
now
when
lichas
had
gone
to
the
tents
by
the
shore
there
came
to
deianeira
in
the
palace
a
who
told
her
that
lichas
had
not
answered
truly
in
this
matter
he
knows
as
well
as
i
who
this
fair
stranger
is
said
the
she
is
the
daughter
of
king
eurytus
of
œchalia
and
the
sister
of
iphitus
her
name
is
iole
and
it
was
for
the
sake
of
her
beauty
that
heracles
destroyed
her
father
s
illustration
deianeira
and
the
dying
centaur
nessus
then
deianeira
was
sadly
troubled
lest
the
heart
of
the
great
hero
should
be
turned
away
from
her
and
his
affections
set
upon
this
lovely
captive
so
she
sent
again
for
lichas
and
questioned
him
still
further
at
first
he
denied
that
he
knew
any
thing
about
the
fair
lady
but
afterwards
when
hard
pressed
he
said
she
is
indeed
iole
the
fair
damsel
whom
heracles
loved
in
the
springtime
of
youth
but
why
he
has
brought
this
great
grief
upon
her
and
upon
her
father
s
house
i
can
not
sorely
troubled
now
was
deianeira
and
all
day
long
she
sat
in
her
chamber
and
pondered
what
she
should
do
and
when
the
evening
was
come
she
called
her
friends
together
the
women
and
maidens
who
dwelt
in
trachis
and
talked
with
them
i
have
been
thinking
of
what
i
can
do
to
keep
my
husband
s
love
she
said
i
had
almost
forgotten
that
i
have
a
charm
which
will
help
me
or
i
might
not
have
been
so
sadly
troubled
years
and
years
ago
when
we
were
fleeing
from
my
dear
old
home
at
calydon
we
came
to
the
river
evenus
the
water
was
very
deep
and
the
current
very
swift
but
there
lived
on
the
banks
of
the
stream
an
old
centaur
named
nessus
whose
business
it
was
to
ferry
travellers
across
to
the
other
shore
he
first
took
my
husband
safely
over
and
then
myself
and
our
little
son
hyllus
but
he
was
so
rude
and
withal
so
savage
in
his
manners
that
heracles
was
greatly
angered
at
him
and
he
drew
his
bow
and
shot
the
brutish
fellow
with
one
of
his
poisoned
arrows
then
my
woman
s
heart
was
filled
with
pity
for
the
dying
centaur
wicked
though
he
was
and
i
felt
loath
to
leave
him
suffering
alone
upon
the
banks
of
evenus
and
he
seeing
me
look
back
beckoned
me
to
him
woman
he
said
i
am
dying
but
first
i
would
give
thee
a
precious
gift
fill
a
vial
with
the
blood
that
flows
from
this
wound
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
if
ever
thy
husband
s
affections
grow
cold
it
will
serve
as
a
charm
to
make
him
love
thee
as
before
it
needs
only
that
thou
shouldst
smear
the
blood
upon
a
garment
and
then
cause
him
to
wear
the
garment
so
that
the
heat
of
the
sun
or
of
a
fire
shall
strike
upon
it
i
quickly
filled
the
vial
as
he
directed
and
hastened
to
follow
my
then
deianeira
called
the
herald
lichas
and
said
behold
here
is
a
fair
white
garment
which
i
have
woven
with
my
own
hands
and
i
vowed
many
days
ago
that
if
my
husband
should
again
come
home
i
would
give
him
this
garment
to
wear
while
offering
sacrifice
now
he
tarries
as
you
say
to
do
homage
to
the
gods
in
eubœa
go
back
therefore
to
meet
him
and
give
him
this
white
robe
as
a
gift
from
his
wife
say
to
him
that
on
no
account
shall
he
let
another
wear
it
and
that
he
shall
keep
it
carefully
folded
up
away
from
the
light
and
the
heat
until
he
shall
be
ready
to
clothe
himself
in
the
herald
promised
to
do
as
he
was
bidden
and
in
that
same
hour
he
hastened
back
to
meet
his
master
in
eubœa
taking
with
him
his
master
s
young
son
hyllus
not
many
days
after
this
a
great
cry
and
sad
bewailings
were
heard
in
the
house
of
heracles
and
deianeira
rushed
forth
from
her
chamber
crying
aloud
that
she
had
done
some
terrible
deed
for
i
anointed
the
fair
robe
which
i
sent
to
my
husband
with
the
blood
of
nessus
the
centaur
and
now
behold
the
bit
of
woollen
cloth
which
i
dipped
into
the
charm
and
used
as
a
brush
in
spreading
it
upon
the
robe
is
turned
to
dust
as
if
a
fire
had
burned
it
up
i
have
not
forgotten
any
thing
that
the
centaur
told
me
how
i
was
to
keep
the
charm
where
neither
the
light
of
the
sun
nor
the
heat
of
the
fire
could
touch
it
and
this
i
have
done
until
now
only
the
bit
of
woollen
cloth
was
left
lying
in
the
sunshine
oh
fearful
am
i
that
i
have
slain
my
husband
for
why
should
the
centaur
wish
to
do
well
by
the
man
who
brought
death
upon
him
hardly
had
she
spoken
these
words
when
her
son
hyllus
came
in
great
haste
to
the
palace
even
into
the
woman
s
hall
where
she
stood
o
my
mother
he
cried
would
that
you
were
not
my
mother
for
do
you
know
that
you
have
this
day
brought
death
and
destruction
upon
my
oh
say
not
so
my
son
wailed
deianeira
it
can
not
be
but
truly
it
is
so
said
hyllus
for
when
lichas
and
myself
came
to
eubœa
bearing
the
white
robe
which
you
sent
we
found
my
father
ready
to
begin
his
offering
of
sacrifices
and
he
was
glad
to
see
me
and
to
hear
from
you
and
he
took
the
beautiful
robe
and
put
it
upon
him
then
he
slew
twelve
fair
oxen
and
joyfully
worshipped
the
powers
but
when
the
fire
grew
hot
the
deadly
robe
began
to
cling
to
him
and
pangs
as
if
caused
by
the
stings
of
serpents
shot
through
him
and
the
pains
of
death
seized
on
him
he
asked
lichas
why
he
had
brought
that
robe
and
when
the
herald
told
him
that
it
was
your
gift
he
seized
the
wretch
and
cast
him
over
the
cliff
upon
the
sharp
rocks
beneath
and
great
fear
filled
the
hearts
of
all
who
saw
the
sufferings
of
the
mighty
hero
and
none
of
them
dared
come
near
him
so
terrible
were
his
struggles
then
he
called
to
me
and
said
come
here
my
son
do
not
flee
from
your
father
in
his
great
distress
but
carry
me
from
this
land
and
set
me
where
the
eyes
of
no
man
shall
see
me
and
so
we
put
him
in
the
hold
of
our
good
ship
and
brought
him
home
with
us
to
trachis
and
soon
you
shall
see
what
you
have
done
for
you
have
slain
your
husband
a
hero
the
like
of
whom
the
world
shall
never
see
when
deianeira
heard
these
words
she
made
no
answer
but
with
one
despairing
cry
she
hasted
to
her
chamber
and
when
soon
afterward
her
maidens
sought
her
there
she
was
dead
then
hyllus
came
also
seeking
her
for
the
women
of
the
household
had
told
him
how
she
had
been
deceived
by
the
dying
centaur
and
when
he
saw
her
lifeless
form
he
wept
bitterly
and
cried
out
that
now
indeed
the
fates
had
bereft
him
of
both
father
and
mother
on
the
same
day
then
they
brought
heracles
into
his
own
broad
hall
bearing
him
upon
a
litter
he
was
asleep
for
the
pain
had
left
him
a
little
while
and
tired
nature
was
taking
her
dues
but
the
sad
wailings
of
his
son
awoke
him
and
again
he
cried
aloud
in
his
agony
and
besought
those
who
stood
around
him
that
they
would
give
him
a
sword
wherewith
to
end
his
pain
then
hyllus
came
into
the
hall
and
told
his
father
all
about
the
terrible
mistake
which
his
mother
had
made
and
how
the
centaur
had
deceived
her
and
how
she
was
at
that
moment
lying
dead
with
a
broken
heart
in
the
chamber
overhead
then
indeed
is
my
doom
come
cried
heracles
for
long
ago
the
oracles
spake
of
me
that
i
should
die
not
by
the
hands
of
any
living
being
but
by
the
guile
of
one
dwelling
in
the
regions
of
the
dead
so
now
nessus
whom
i
slew
so
long
ago
is
avenged
for
he
has
slain
me
now
my
son
carry
me
to
the
wooded
summit
of
the
hill
of
œta
and
build
there
a
great
pile
of
olive
beams
and
of
oak
and
when
it
is
finished
lay
me
upon
it
and
set
fire
unto
it
and
shed
no
tear
neither
utter
any
cry
but
work
in
silence
for
thus
thou
shalt
prove
thyself
a
son
of
the
boy
promised
to
do
all
this
as
his
father
wished
only
he
would
not
set
fire
to
the
pile
so
when
he
had
built
the
pile
and
had
put
between
the
beams
great
stores
of
spices
and
herbs
they
laid
heracles
upon
it
and
philoctetes
the
hero
s
set
fire
to
the
pile
and
heracles
for
this
kindness
gave
to
philoctetes
his
famous
bow
a
weapon
more
marvellous
even
than
the
bow
of
eurytus
then
the
red
flames
shot
high
towards
heaven
shedding
brightness
over
land
and
sea
and
the
mighty
hero
was
at
rest
he
had
met
his
master
such
was
the
story
that
the
old
told
in
the
hall
of
king
laertes
xv
live
the
king
surely
sighed
laertes
the
old
heroes
pass
away
but
the
younger
heroes
press
hard
in
their
footsteps
and
will
fill
their
places
well
the
gods
have
written
it
in
every
tree
and
upon
every
blade
of
grass
that
the
aged
however
worthy
can
not
endure
forever
the
ripened
fruit
falls
to
the
ground
but
there
will
be
other
and
better
fruit
on
the
branches
by
and
by
ancient
cronos
gave
place
not
willingly
to
zeus
and
zeus
is
by
far
the
greater
of
the
two
and
there
be
certain
oracles
which
have
foretold
the
doom
of
zeus
even
that
he
shall
be
hurled
from
his
throne
by
a
king
of
peace
who
shall
reign
everlastingly
then
on
a
day
he
called
the
elders
of
ithaca
together
and
spoke
to
them
in
this
wise
my
son
odysseus
is
now
a
man
wise
and
shrewd
beyond
any
other
among
you
he
is
skilled
in
all
kinds
of
knowledge
and
of
handicraft
in
matters
of
judgment
he
is
without
a
peer
and
in
matters
requiring
courage
he
is
foremost
among
men
moreover
he
is
married
to
a
wife
sweet
penelope
unexcelled
in
wifely
virtues
and
he
has
a
son
and
heir
telemachus
a
smiling
babe
who
has
not
yet
seen
the
round
of
one
full
moon
now
why
should
the
old
branch
stand
longer
in
the
way
of
the
new
and
vigorous
shoot
this
day
i
will
give
up
my
kingdom
to
my
son
and
he
shall
henceforth
rule
this
island
in
his
own
name
and
all
the
people
rejoiced
when
they
heard
his
words
and
straightway
they
hailed
odysseus
king
of
ithaca
and
offered
thanksgiving
and
sacrifice
to
pallas
athené
who
had
blessed
him
with
wisdom
above
that
of
other
men
and
good
laertes
retired
to
his
mountain
farm
where
no
vexing
questions
of
government
would
take
him
away
from
his
vines
and
here
said
he
i
hope
to
end
my
days
in
peace
when
the
men
of
cephallenia
and
the
dwellers
in
the
rugged
island
of
zacynthus
heard
that
young
odysseus
ruled
by
his
own
right
in
ithaca
they
came
and
offered
him
their
friendship
and
allegiance
for
they
were
kinsmen
of
the
ithacans
they
brought
rich
presents
of
corn
and
wine
and
of
sheep
and
promised
to
bear
him
aid
in
time
of
need
if
ever
that
time
should
come
at
about
this
time
old
icarius
the
father
of
penelope
came
to
ithaca
for
a
brief
visit
to
his
daughter
for
his
eyes
had
long
yearned
to
see
her
and
he
could
find
no
rest
until
he
knew
that
she
was
happy
and
well
cared
for
in
the
new
home
which
she
had
chosen
and
penelope
asked
him
a
thousand
questions
about
her
friends
and
her
kinsfolk
in
dear
old
lacedæmon
and
to
all
these
questions
he
made
answer
as
he
best
knew
we
have
now
a
new
king
at
lacedæmon
said
icarius
even
brave
menelaus
the
husband
of
your
cousin
helen
but
where
is
king
tyndareus
my
good
uncle
asked
penelope
and
where
are
my
noble
twin
cousins
castor
and
polydeuces
do
they
share
the
kingdom
with
menelaus
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
answered
her
father
and
then
he
told
her
how
it
had
come
about
that
menelaus
was
called
to
the
kingship
of
lacedæmon
as
the
feebleness
of
age
began
to
take
hold
upon
him
king
tyndareus
bethought
him
that
he
would
resign
his
kingdom
to
his
sons
the
twin
heroes
castor
and
polydeuces
but
the
restless
youths
cared
not
to
take
upon
them
duties
which
would
keep
them
within
the
narrow
bounds
of
lacedæmon
for
they
were
not
but
they
wandered
hither
and
thither
over
many
seas
and
through
strange
lands
doing
brave
and
noble
deeds
innumerable
the
story
of
their
labors
in
times
of
peace
and
of
their
prowess
in
times
of
war
was
upon
every
tongue
and
was
sung
by
minstrels
in
every
city
of
hellas
wherever
public
games
were
held
there
the
twins
were
the
masters
of
the
course
and
the
field
and
the
awarders
of
the
prizes
wherever
battles
raged
and
where
the
fight
was
thickest
there
the
glorious
heroes
on
their
steeds
were
seen
striking
fearlessly
for
the
cause
of
right
and
men
told
how
it
was
they
who
first
taught
the
bards
to
sing
songs
of
battle
and
pæans
of
victory
and
how
it
was
they
who
first
showed
the
glad
feet
of
the
victors
how
to
tread
the
wild
mazes
of
the
and
how
it
was
they
who
in
their
friendship
for
seafarers
had
guided
many
a
vessel
over
the
roughest
seas
safe
into
the
haven
they
belonged
not
more
to
their
native
lacedæmon
than
to
the
whole
wide
world
there
came
a
time
however
when
the
men
of
laconia
quarrelled
with
their
neighbors
of
arcadia
and
there
was
war
upon
the
borders
then
castor
and
polydeuces
hastened
to
take
sides
with
their
kinsmen
mounted
on
their
swift
steeds
phlogios
and
harpagos
the
gifts
of
hermes
they
made
raid
after
raid
across
the
mountains
and
they
brought
back
many
a
choice
herd
of
cattle
or
flock
of
sheep
from
the
pasture
lands
of
arcadia
it
happened
on
a
day
that
their
cousins
idas
and
lynceus
two
lawless
men
from
messene
joined
them
and
the
four
drove
many
cattle
across
the
borders
and
hid
them
in
a
glen
at
the
foot
of
mount
taygetus
then
they
agreed
that
idas
should
divide
the
booty
into
four
parts
and
give
to
each
a
part
but
idas
was
a
crafty
man
more
famed
for
his
guile
than
for
his
courage
and
he
planned
how
he
might
take
all
the
herd
for
his
own
so
he
killed
a
fat
ox
and
having
flayed
and
dressed
it
he
cut
it
into
four
parts
then
he
called
the
other
men
about
him
it
would
be
a
great
pity
to
divide
so
fine
a
herd
as
this
of
ours
among
four
owners
he
said
therefore
i
have
a
plan
by
which
one
or
at
most
two
of
us
may
fairly
gain
the
whole
behold
here
are
the
four
quarters
of
the
ox
which
i
have
slain
this
quarter
belongs
to
castor
this
to
polydeuces
this
to
lynceus
and
this
to
myself
he
who
first
eats
the
share
allotted
to
him
shall
have
half
of
the
cattle
for
his
own
he
who
next
finishes
shall
have
the
other
then
without
another
word
he
began
to
eat
the
quarter
which
he
had
allotted
to
himself
nor
was
he
long
devouring
it
but
with
greedy
haste
consumed
it
before
his
comrades
had
tasted
even
a
morsel
next
he
seized
upon
the
part
assigned
to
lynceus
and
ate
it
as
quickly
as
his
own
the
cattle
are
all
mine
he
cried
and
calling
upon
his
brother
to
help
him
they
drove
the
whole
herd
into
messene
then
anger
filled
the
souls
of
the
twin
heroes
and
they
vowed
to
take
vengeance
upon
their
crafty
kinsmen
one
night
when
the
moon
lighted
up
both
plain
and
mountain
with
her
silvery
beams
they
made
a
rapid
ride
into
messene
and
brought
back
not
only
the
herd
which
idas
had
taken
from
them
by
fraud
but
as
many
cattle
as
were
feeding
in
the
messenian
meadows
then
knowing
that
their
cousins
would
follow
them
in
hot
haste
they
hid
themselves
in
the
hollow
of
a
tree
in
the
mountain
pass
and
waited
for
the
morning
at
break
of
day
the
two
messenians
having
missed
their
cattle
hastened
to
follow
their
trail
to
mount
taygetus
then
lynceus
whose
sharp
eyes
could
see
through
rocks
and
the
trunks
of
trees
climbed
to
the
top
of
a
crag
to
look
about
them
for
they
feared
lest
they
should
fall
into
an
ambush
and
as
he
peered
into
every
nook
and
glen
and
gorge
of
the
wild
mountain
he
saw
the
twins
in
the
hollow
trunk
of
an
oak
then
quickly
he
descended
and
with
stealthy
tread
he
and
idas
drew
near
their
castor
saw
them
first
but
before
he
could
speak
a
spear
from
the
hand
of
idas
laid
him
low
in
death
then
mighty
polydeuces
leaped
forth
in
his
wrath
and
rushed
upon
the
slayers
of
his
brother
fear
seized
upon
them
and
they
fled
with
winged
feet
into
messene
and
paused
not
until
they
stood
by
the
marble
tomb
of
their
father
great
aphareus
but
polydeuces
following
on
overtook
them
there
and
with
his
spear
he
smote
lynceus
a
deadly
blow
at
the
same
time
a
peal
of
thunder
shook
the
mountain
and
rolled
over
the
plain
and
zeus
hurled
his
fiery
bolts
at
the
bosom
of
crafty
idas
and
laid
him
dead
upon
his
father
s
tomb
the
grief
of
polydeuces
for
the
death
of
castor
was
terrible
to
see
and
there
was
no
one
in
all
the
world
who
could
comfort
him
or
in
any
way
make
him
forget
his
loss
then
he
prayed
the
gods
that
they
would
take
him
too
to
hades
that
he
might
be
in
the
dear
company
of
his
brother
and
zeus
heard
his
prayer
and
he
asked
polydeuces
to
choose
whether
he
would
sit
in
the
courts
of
olympus
and
be
the
peer
of
ares
and
pallas
athené
or
whether
he
would
share
all
things
with
castor
and
the
glorious
hero
cried
let
me
be
forever
with
my
brother
his
wish
was
granted
to
him
and
the
twin
heroes
still
live
although
the
quickening
earth
lies
over
them
one
day
they
wander
in
the
fields
of
asphodel
and
enjoy
the
bliss
of
immortality
the
next
they
flit
among
the
unquiet
shades
in
the
sunless
regions
of
the
dead
and
thus
they
share
together
whatever
of
joy
or
woe
the
grave
can
bring
when
king
tyndareus
learned
that
he
was
bereft
of
his
sons
he
fell
prone
to
the
earth
and
no
one
in
lacedæmon
could
console
him
send
for
helen
my
peerless
daughter
he
cried
send
for
menelaus
he
is
my
only
son
he
shall
dwell
in
my
palace
and
rule
in
my
stead
and
that
is
the
way
in
which
it
came
about
that
menelaus
was
called
to
the
kingship
of
lacedæmon
old
icarius
remained
but
a
short
time
at
ithaca
a
ship
was
waiting
in
the
harbor
ready
to
sail
to
pylos
and
the
ports
beyond
and
he
knew
that
a
like
opportunity
to
return
to
lacedæmon
might
not
soon
be
offered
and
so
leaving
his
blessing
with
his
children
odysseus
and
penelope
and
the
babe
telemachus
he
departed
xvi
children
of
prometheus
there
was
sore
distress
in
lacedæmon
famine
and
a
deadly
pestilence
grieved
the
land
and
in
every
household
the
notes
of
wailing
and
despair
were
heard
for
apollo
vexed
because
the
men
of
laconia
were
so
slow
to
understand
his
wishes
was
shooting
his
fateful
arrows
broadcast
among
them
like
a
he
brooded
over
the
land
and
strong
men
and
fair
women
and
helpless
babes
all
fell
alike
beneath
the
sharp
blows
of
his
deadly
shafts
and
the
heart
of
menelaus
the
king
was
burdened
with
grief
because
of
the
people
s
sore
affliction
then
when
he
found
that
sacrifice
of
lambs
and
goats
availed
him
nothing
he
sent
in
haste
to
ask
the
oracles
the
cause
of
apollo
s
wrath
and
to
learn
what
could
be
done
to
stay
the
plague
the
answer
came
as
quickly
when
the
bones
of
the
children
of
prometheus
are
brought
from
ilios
and
entombed
in
lacedæmon
then
the
wrath
of
apollo
shall
be
turned
aside
and
the
smiles
of
his
favor
shall
bless
the
land
then
menelaus
made
ready
to
depart
at
once
to
troy
to
do
that
which
apollo
demanded
a
short
journey
by
land
brought
him
to
the
town
of
helos
on
the
shore
of
the
eastern
sea
there
a
ship
lay
at
its
moorings
while
a
score
of
seamen
paced
the
beach
anxious
to
embark
upon
any
errand
across
poseidon
s
watery
kingdom
the
captain
hailed
the
king
with
joy
and
the
ship
was
soon
made
ready
for
the
long
voyage
to
ilios
a
plenteous
stock
of
food
was
stored
away
in
the
broad
hold
arms
for
defence
against
sea
robbers
and
savage
men
were
put
in
order
and
hung
in
their
places
and
rich
presents
for
priam
king
of
troy
were
taken
on
board
the
next
day
a
favoring
wind
sprang
up
the
sails
were
set
the
seamen
took
their
places
and
the
ship
with
king
menelaus
on
board
sped
on
its
way
to
distant
ilios
poseidon
looking
out
from
his
golden
palace
beneath
the
sea
saw
the
vessel
as
it
hastened
on
its
errand
and
he
bade
the
waves
be
still
and
in
no
wise
hinder
its
speed
for
apollo
s
business
must
not
be
delayed
and
he
called
upon
the
breezes
to
blow
steadily
towards
ilios
that
so
the
embassy
of
menelaus
might
be
happily
performed
surely
the
gods
are
all
in
league
with
us
said
the
captain
of
the
ship
one
day
pleased
with
the
delightful
voyage
we
shall
doubtless
sight
the
lesbian
coast
and
from
thence
it
is
but
a
short
sail
to
ilios
and
troy
and
now
as
we
sit
together
in
the
prow
of
our
good
vessel
i
pray
you
to
tell
us
the
story
once
more
of
great
prometheus
the
bones
of
whose
children
seem
so
precious
to
apollo
and
menelaus
willingly
consented
and
told
the
story
as
he
himself
had
heard
it
from
the
bards
when
zeus
waged
pitiless
war
upon
the
titans
and
hurled
them
headlong
from
the
heights
of
mount
olympus
he
spared
from
the
general
ruin
those
who
fought
not
with
their
own
kindred
but
espoused
his
cause
among
these
and
foremost
of
all
was
great
prometheus
whose
name
is
forethought
and
whose
chiefest
glory
lies
in
this
that
he
was
the
friend
and
lover
of
mankind
it
was
the
hope
of
bettering
man
s
condition
that
led
him
to
fight
against
his
kindred
and
to
aid
in
placing
zeus
upon
the
throne
of
ancient
cronos
yet
zeus
cared
naught
for
the
feeble
children
of
earth
but
sought
rather
to
make
their
burdens
heavier
and
their
lives
more
sad
that
so
the
race
might
perish
utterly
and
the
great
mind
of
prometheus
set
to
work
to
learn
how
to
make
their
lot
less
sad
and
their
lives
less
miserable
he
saw
that
as
yet
they
dwelt
without
forethought
upon
the
earth
their
life
s
whole
length
being
aimless
and
their
minds
as
void
of
reason
as
is
the
beast
s
they
lived
in
sunless
caverns
or
in
holes
scooped
in
the
ground
and
no
provision
did
they
make
for
heat
or
cold
or
times
of
scarcity
or
the
varying
needs
of
youth
and
age
and
prometheus
wasted
no
vain
words
in
pity
but
took
at
once
upon
him
the
titanic
task
of
lifting
the
race
up
to
a
level
with
the
gods
first
he
taught
them
the
use
of
fire
which
some
say
he
stole
from
helios
car
and
brought
to
the
earth
hidden
in
a
then
he
showed
them
how
the
stars
rise
and
set
and
how
the
seasons
change
in
order
he
showed
them
how
to
yoke
and
make
submissive
to
their
will
the
wild
steeds
of
the
desert
plain
how
to
turn
the
sod
beneath
the
soil
by
means
of
the
furrowing
plough
and
how
to
build
fair
houses
and
cities
with
strong
walls
and
frowning
towers
he
taught
them
how
to
make
ships
the
chariots
of
the
sea
and
how
to
navigate
the
briny
deep
he
showed
them
the
treasures
which
lie
hidden
underneath
the
ground
gold
silver
iron
and
taught
them
how
to
turn
them
into
forms
of
beauty
strength
and
use
in
short
all
arts
now
known
to
men
came
to
them
from
the
hands
and
mind
of
pitying
prometheus
now
when
zeus
looked
down
from
high
olympus
and
saw
the
puny
tribes
of
men
no
longer
grovelling
in
the
earth
like
senseless
beasts
but
standing
upright
and
claiming
kinship
with
the
gods
he
shook
with
anger
and
he
called
two
of
his
mightiest
servants
strength
and
force
whom
none
can
resist
and
bade
them
seize
the
friend
of
man
and
bind
him
upon
a
peak
of
the
caucasus
there
to
linger
through
the
ages
in
loneliness
and
pain
then
the
ruthless
slaves
of
zeus
went
forth
to
do
his
bidding
they
seized
the
mighty
titan
and
dragged
him
to
the
bleak
and
barren
regions
of
the
caucasus
beyond
the
utmost
limit
of
the
habitable
earth
and
with
them
went
the
mighty
smith
hephaestus
all
unwillingly
to
bind
the
great
victim
with
bonds
of
brass
which
none
could
loose
to
the
lonely
mountain
crags
this
thing
i
do
loathing
said
hephaestus
here
i
must
perforce
leave
thee
chained
and
bolted
to
the
immovable
rocks
thou
shalt
never
behold
the
face
of
man
nor
hear
the
accents
of
his
voice
but
the
blaze
of
the
unpitying
sun
shall
scorch
thy
fair
skin
and
thou
shalt
long
for
the
night
with
its
shimmering
stars
to
cast
a
veil
of
coolness
over
thee
year
after
year
thou
shalt
keep
thy
lonely
watch
in
this
joyless
place
unblest
with
sleep
and
uttering
many
a
cry
and
unavailing
moan
for
zeus
is
pitiless
this
is
what
thou
gainest
for
befriending
there
then
they
left
him
fettered
but
not
until
rude
strength
had
taunted
him
lo
thou
lover
of
mankind
call
now
the
puny
race
of
mortals
round
thee
and
crown
them
with
honors
could
all
of
them
together
lessen
thy
punishment
in
the
least
surely
the
gods
did
jest
when
they
gave
thee
the
name
of
forethought
for
thou
hast
need
of
forethought
to
free
thee
from
these
then
when
the
solitary
sufferer
knew
that
there
was
no
one
to
hear
him
save
only
the
sun
and
the
earth
and
the
winds
and
the
winding
river
and
the
distant
sea
he
broke
forth
in
grievous
cries
and
lamentations
o
pitying
sky
and
winds
and
and
the
smile
of
ocean
i
cry
to
you
o
mother
earth
and
thou
sun
behold
what
i
endure
because
i
gave
honor
to
mortals
behold
what
torture
is
in
store
for
me
while
for
ten
thousand
years
i
writhe
in
these
unseemly
chains
yet
the
things
that
come
are
all
foreknown
to
me
and
nothing
happens
unexpected
and
i
must
bear
as
best
i
may
the
ills
that
will
perforce
be
mine
knowing
that
the
end
of
all
these
things
shall
come
to
me
at
then
the
ocean
nymphs
with
the
fragrance
of
flowers
and
a
rustling
sound
like
the
whirr
of
birds
came
floating
through
the
air
and
hovered
about
the
crag
where
prometheus
was
bound
they
had
heard
the
clank
of
the
iron
and
the
heavy
blow
of
the
sledge
resounding
to
the
very
of
ocean
and
they
had
hastened
to
come
and
offer
him
their
sympathy
following
them
came
old
oceanus
himself
riding
in
his
winged
chariot
for
no
firmer
friend
had
prometheus
than
this
ancient
of
the
encircling
sea
he
came
to
condole
with
the
suffering
titan
and
to
counsel
patience
and
submission
but
he
staid
not
long
i
will
drink
the
cup
of
bitterness
to
its
very
dregs
said
prometheus
and
will
bide
the
time
when
zeus
shall
have
quenched
his
and
oceanus
feeling
that
he
had
come
in
vain
turned
about
and
gladly
hastened
homeward
to
his
halls
beneath
the
ocean
billows
after
this
many
others
came
weeping
tears
of
sorrow
for
the
sufferer
tears
of
anger
at
the
tyranny
of
zeus
and
wails
of
mourning
were
borne
thither
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
from
all
the
tribes
that
dwelt
in
asia
from
the
warrior
maidens
on
the
colchian
coasts
from
the
savage
horsemen
of
the
scythian
plains
and
from
the
dwellers
on
the
farther
shores
of
araby
but
the
titan
chained
to
the
desolate
crags
suffered
on
above
him
the
vultures
hovered
and
the
wild
eagles
shrieked
and
sun
and
storm
beat
mercilessly
upon
his
head
as
the
weary
days
and
the
lengthening
years
passed
by
and
yet
no
deliverance
came
one
day
as
he
writhed
helplessly
in
his
chains
prometheus
saw
in
the
valley
below
him
what
at
so
great
distance
seemed
to
be
a
beautiful
heifer
having
a
fair
face
like
that
of
a
woman
surely
said
he
aloud
it
is
the
child
of
inachus
she
who
warmed
the
heart
of
zeus
and
is
now
through
here
s
hate
changed
into
an
unseemly
shape
and
driven
to
weary
then
the
maiden
gazed
at
him
in
wonder
and
asked
who
are
you
whom
the
gods
have
doomed
to
suffer
in
this
solitary
place
and
how
came
you
to
know
my
father
s
name
and
the
sorrows
that
have
come
upon
me
and
tell
me
i
pray
if
such
knowledge
be
yours
whether
there
shall
ever
be
any
help
for
me
and
when
my
sufferings
shall
have
an
the
titan
answered
i
who
speak
to
thee
am
prometheus
who
brought
down
fire
to
men
and
gave
them
knowledge
and
taught
them
how
to
do
godlike
things
and
i
know
that
thou
art
io
once
the
lovely
daughter
of
inachus
king
of
argos
but
what
thou
art
now
let
thy
own
lips
speak
and
i
can
not
choose
but
tell
you
all
the
maiden
answered
though
my
speech
shall
with
sobs
be
broken
when
i
recall
the
memory
of
happy
days
forever
gone
there
was
a
time
when
in
my
father
s
halls
i
dwelt
in
maidenly
freedom
a
spoiled
and
petted
child
but
as
i
grew
to
womanhood
dreams
came
to
me
which
told
me
that
i
was
beloved
by
zeus
such
trouble
did
these
visions
bring
to
me
that
i
was
fain
to
tell
my
father
of
them
he
knew
not
what
to
do
but
he
sent
swift
messengers
to
delphi
and
dodona
to
ask
the
oracles
what
the
dreams
portended
and
how
he
could
best
give
pleasure
to
the
gods
the
answer
came
that
he
should
drive
me
from
his
doors
into
the
wide
and
cruel
world
or
otherwise
the
fiery
bolts
of
zeus
would
burn
up
all
his
household
and
destroy
him
utterly
reluctantly
and
weeping
bitter
tears
he
shut
me
out
and
lo
straightway
my
body
was
changed
into
the
loathed
form
which
stands
before
you
and
a
stung
me
with
its
fangs
and
i
rushed
away
in
madness
vainly
hoping
to
find
relief
at
lerne
s
fountain
water
but
there
the
herdsman
argus
with
his
hundred
eyes
did
track
me
out
and
with
his
scourge
and
the
goading
fly
i
was
driven
along
unending
ways
then
hermes
seeing
my
distress
took
pity
on
me
and
sought
to
free
me
from
my
cruel
keeper
but
argus
never
slept
and
with
his
hundred
eyes
he
saw
every
danger
and
shunned
it
while
it
was
yet
afar
at
last
hermes
bethought
him
of
the
power
of
music
playing
a
soft
melody
on
his
lute
he
stole
gently
towards
the
herdsman
the
sweet
sounds
charmed
the
savage
ear
and
sleep
overpowered
the
hundred
eyes
then
hermes
drew
his
sword
quickly
and
smote
off
the
head
of
argus
thus
gaining
for
himself
the
name
of
the
but
the
shade
of
the
terrible
herdsman
still
follows
me
and
i
find
no
rest
and
aimlessly
i
have
come
thus
goaded
onward
to
this
wild
mountain
illustration
prometheus
then
prometheus
in
pitying
accents
said
listen
now
to
me
and
i
will
tell
thee
io
what
other
sorrows
thou
must
bear
from
here
for
it
is
she
who
brought
this
woe
upon
thee
and
who
hounds
thee
thus
from
land
to
land
thou
shalt
journey
onward
from
these
mountain
regions
through
the
scythian
land
and
the
region
of
the
uncouth
chalybes
who
work
in
iron
thence
thou
shalt
cross
the
mountains
to
the
of
the
amazons
who
shall
lead
thee
to
the
place
where
the
are
narrowest
there
thou
shalt
plunge
into
the
waves
and
swim
with
fearlessness
of
heart
to
asia
s
shore
and
that
strait
shall
by
its
name
bosphorus
tell
to
latest
ages
the
story
of
thy
wandering
but
what
i
have
told
thee
is
only
the
beginning
of
thy
then
io
wept
were
it
not
better
to
die
she
asked
than
to
endure
this
hopeless
misery
not
so
o
maiden
answered
the
titan
for
if
thou
livest
then
a
son
of
thine
shall
loose
me
from
my
fetters
and
perchance
shall
shake
the
throne
of
zeus
himself
when
thou
hast
crossed
the
which
part
the
continent
thou
shalt
wander
on
until
thou
hast
reached
the
outmost
islands
where
the
gorgons
dwell
then
returning
thou
shalt
pass
through
the
country
of
the
griffins
and
the
region
of
ethiopia
and
shalt
come
at
last
to
the
ground
where
flows
the
nile
there
thou
shalt
rest
and
thy
maiden
form
with
all
its
comeliness
shall
be
thine
again
in
canobus
a
fair
city
by
the
sea
shall
a
home
be
made
for
thee
and
there
shall
epaphos
thy
son
be
born
from
whom
in
shall
spring
great
heracles
who
shall
break
my
bonds
and
set
me
free
from
these
hated
then
io
with
a
sigh
of
mingled
hope
and
despair
went
on
her
weary
way
and
left
prometheus
alone
again
in
the
everlasting
solitudes
and
the
wild
eagles
swooped
down
from
their
nests
and
circled
with
threatening
screams
about
him
a
grim
vulture
flapped
its
wings
in
his
face
and
buried
its
talons
in
his
bosom
a
mighty
storm
came
hurtling
down
through
the
mountain
passes
the
earth
shook
to
and
fro
and
the
peaks
of
caucasus
seemed
as
if
toppling
to
their
base
a
hurricane
of
snow
and
hail
and
rattling
ice
smote
the
titan
about
the
head
and
wrapped
his
body
in
eddying
gusts
the
lightnings
leaped
with
lurid
glare
athwart
the
sky
and
the
thunders
crashed
with
deafening
roar
among
the
crags
and
earth
and
air
and
sea
seemed
blent
together
in
a
mighty
turmoil
and
whirling
into
utter
chaos
yet
in
the
midst
of
all
the
old
titan
quailed
not
but
with
voice
serene
and
strong
he
sang
of
the
day
when
right
shall
triumph
over
might
when
truth
shall
trample
error
in
the
dust
and
the
reign
of
zeus
give
place
to
that
of
a
nobler
monarch
just
and
perfect
in
all
his
ways
thus
years
upon
years
passed
and
ages
circled
by
until
thirteen
generations
of
men
had
lived
and
died
upon
the
earth
then
came
heracles
the
descendant
of
io
to
purge
the
world
of
vile
monsters
and
to
give
freedom
to
those
who
were
in
bonds
and
as
he
wandered
from
land
to
land
to
do
the
bidding
of
his
master
eurystheus
he
passed
through
ethiopia
and
came
to
the
region
of
the
caucasus
close
by
the
eastern
ocean
s
stream
there
as
he
gazed
upward
at
the
everlasting
peaks
he
saw
the
great
titan
fettered
to
the
naked
rock
while
the
eagles
circled
about
him
and
the
grim
vulture
digged
its
talons
into
his
flesh
and
heracles
knew
that
this
was
prometheus
the
ancient
the
friend
of
the
human
race
and
the
foe
of
tyrants
he
drew
his
bow
and
with
his
unerring
arrows
slew
the
eagles
and
the
vulture
and
then
with
mighty
blows
of
his
club
he
broke
the
chains
which
hephaestus
of
old
had
wrought
and
with
his
strong
hands
he
loosed
the
prisoner
from
his
fetters
and
the
earth
rejoiced
and
men
everywhere
sang
pæans
of
triumph
because
freedom
had
been
given
to
him
who
raised
them
from
the
dust
and
endowed
them
with
the
light
of
reason
and
the
fire
of
intelligence
this
was
the
tale
which
menelaus
told
to
a
company
of
eager
listeners
seated
about
him
in
the
prow
of
the
vessel
now
you
should
know
he
added
that
every
lover
of
freedom
in
hellas
is
in
truth
a
child
of
prometheus
and
so
when
apollo
through
his
oracle
bade
me
fetch
from
ilios
the
bones
of
the
old
titan
s
children
i
understood
that
i
was
to
gather
the
dust
of
all
the
hellenes
who
have
died
in
the
trojan
land
and
carry
it
to
lacedæmon
for
honored
burial
and
such
is
the
errand
upon
which
we
are
sailing
but
why
is
it
said
that
every
hellene
is
a
child
of
prometheus
asked
the
captain
is
it
simply
because
he
is
a
lover
of
freedom
and
a
hater
of
tyrants
as
the
old
titan
was
or
is
there
a
real
line
of
kinship
reaching
from
us
up
to
him
i
will
tell
you
answered
the
king
while
prometheus
hung
fettered
to
the
bleak
crag
of
caucasus
and
in
grim
patience
bided
the
day
of
deliverance
his
son
deucalion
tilled
the
plains
of
phthia
and
gathered
the
ripe
fruits
on
its
sunny
hills
and
he
dwelt
in
peace
with
all
men
cherishing
in
his
heart
the
words
which
his
father
had
spoken
to
him
in
former
times
but
the
world
was
full
of
wickedness
and
there
was
violence
and
bloodshed
everywhere
and
men
no
longer
had
respect
for
the
gods
or
love
for
one
another
we
are
a
law
unto
ourselves
they
cried
why
then
should
any
one
obey
the
behests
of
a
master
whom
he
has
not
seen
and
they
went
on
eating
and
drinking
and
making
merry
and
gave
no
thanks
to
the
giver
of
every
good
at
length
when
their
wickedness
waxed
so
great
that
it
was
past
all
bearing
zeus
spoke
the
word
and
a
mighty
flood
burst
upon
the
land
the
west
wind
came
sweeping
in
from
the
great
sea
bringing
in
its
arms
dark
clouds
laden
with
rain
and
when
deucalion
saw
the
veil
of
darkness
covering
the
sky
and
heard
the
roar
of
the
hurricane
in
the
valley
below
him
he
called
to
pyrrha
his
wife
and
said
surely
now
the
day
has
come
of
which
my
father
told
me
often
the
day
when
floods
of
water
shall
come
upon
the
earth
to
punish
the
wickedness
of
men
hasten
into
the
ark
which
i
have
built
that
if
so
be
we
may
save
ourselves
from
the
merciless
and
they
made
the
ark
ready
and
put
a
great
store
of
food
in
its
broad
hold
and
waited
for
the
rising
of
the
waters
nor
was
it
long
for
the
torrents
gushed
down
from
the
hillsides
and
filled
the
valleys
and
the
plains
were
covered
over
and
the
forests
sank
from
sight
beneath
the
waves
but
deucalion
and
pyrrha
sat
in
the
ark
and
floated
safely
on
the
bosom
of
the
heaving
waters
day
after
day
they
drifted
hither
and
thither
until
at
last
the
ark
rested
on
the
lofty
peak
of
parnassus
then
deucalion
and
pyrrha
stepped
out
upon
the
dry
ground
the
rain
ceased
to
fall
the
clouds
were
scattered
and
the
waters
fled
down
the
valleys
and
hastened
to
the
sea
but
all
the
people
of
hellas
save
only
deucalion
and
pyrrha
had
perished
in
the
flood
and
feeling
their
loneliness
in
the
midst
of
the
ruin
and
death
which
had
come
upon
the
land
these
two
built
an
altar
to
the
gods
and
offered
thanks
for
their
deliverance
then
zeus
sent
hermes
the
bright
messenger
to
speak
words
of
comfort
to
them
among
all
the
folk
of
this
land
he
said
you
alone
have
lived
blameless
lives
and
with
your
clean
hands
and
pure
hearts
have
pleased
the
immortals
ask
now
what
you
most
desire
and
it
shall
be
given
to
then
deucalion
wept
as
he
bowed
before
the
messenger
grant
that
we
may
see
the
earth
teeming
again
with
busy
men
he
said
it
shall
be
as
you
wish
answered
hermes
as
you
go
down
the
mountain
into
the
plain
cover
your
faces
with
your
mantles
and
throw
the
bones
of
your
mother
behind
then
the
messenger
left
them
and
they
wondered
between
themselves
what
was
the
meaning
of
his
words
who
is
our
mother
asked
pyrrha
is
not
the
earth
the
mother
of
us
all
then
answered
deucalion
his
meaning
is
plain
enough
so
as
they
went
down
parnassus
they
took
up
stones
and
threw
them
behind
them
and
the
stones
which
deucalion
threw
sprang
up
and
were
mighty
armed
men
and
those
which
pyrrha
threw
became
fair
women
thus
the
hills
and
the
valleys
were
peopled
anew
and
the
earth
smiled
and
was
glad
that
a
new
and
happier
day
had
dawned
but
deucalion
went
with
pyrrha
into
locris
and
there
he
built
the
city
of
opus
where
he
reigned
king
for
many
years
and
there
sons
and
daughters
noble
and
beautiful
were
born
but
the
noblest
was
hellen
from
whom
the
hellenes
are
descended
and
our
country
of
hellas
takes
its
name
do
you
understand
now
how
every
one
of
us
can
claim
to
be
a
son
of
great
prometheus
xvii
cause
of
war
time
passed
menelaus
had
returned
from
ilios
bringing
with
him
the
bones
of
his
countrymen
who
had
died
in
that
distant
land
the
great
plague
had
been
stayed
for
the
anger
of
apollo
had
been
assuaged
and
it
had
seemed
for
a
time
that
the
old
days
of
peace
and
plenty
had
come
again
to
lacedæmon
never
to
depart
yet
within
a
few
weeks
all
was
changed
once
more
there
was
silence
in
the
golden
halls
of
menelaus
and
guests
sat
no
longer
as
of
yore
around
the
banquet
tables
anger
and
grief
and
uneasiness
were
plainly
seen
in
every
face
men
gathered
in
the
streets
and
talked
in
wild
excited
tones
about
the
strange
things
which
had
lately
happened
in
lacedæmon
and
the
words
helen
and
paris
and
troy
and
ilios
seemed
to
be
on
every
tongue
and
repeated
with
every
sign
of
love
and
hatred
of
admiration
and
anxiety
our
good
king
by
his
visit
to
ilios
lifted
the
scourge
of
pestilence
and
famine
from
our
land
said
one
of
the
elders
of
the
city
but
he
brought
to
our
shores
a
greater
evil
even
paris
the
handsome
prince
of
troy
and
now
the
glory
of
our
country
the
sun
which
delighted
all
hearts
the
peerless
helen
has
been
stolen
by
the
perfidious
one
and
carried
to
his
home
beyond
the
sea
and
do
you
think
there
will
be
war
asked
a
soldier
toying
with
the
short
dagger
in
his
belt
how
can
it
be
otherwise
answered
the
elder
when
menelaus
won
peerless
helen
for
his
wife
the
noblest
princes
of
hellas
promised
with
solemn
oaths
that
they
would
aid
him
against
any
one
who
should
try
either
by
guile
or
by
force
to
take
her
from
him
let
the
word
be
carried
from
city
to
city
and
all
hellas
will
soon
be
in
arms
the
king
with
his
brother
agamemnon
has
even
now
crossed
over
to
pylos
to
take
counsel
with
old
nestor
the
wisest
of
men
when
he
comes
back
to
lacedæmon
you
may
expect
to
see
the
blazing
on
the
no
sight
would
be
more
welcome
answered
the
soldier
none
indeed
save
only
the
towers
and
palaces
of
troy
in
flames
returned
the
other
earnestly
meanwhile
with
troubled
brow
and
anxious
heart
menelaus
sat
in
nestor
s
halls
and
told
the
story
of
his
wrongs
before
him
seated
on
a
fair
embroidered
couch
was
the
aged
king
listening
with
eager
ears
behind
him
stood
his
brother
agamemnon
tall
and
strong
and
with
eye
and
forehead
like
mighty
zeus
close
by
his
feet
two
heroes
sat
on
this
side
antilochus
the
valiant
son
of
nestor
and
on
that
sage
palamedes
prince
of
eubœa
s
distant
shores
the
last
had
just
arrived
at
pylos
and
had
not
learned
the
errand
which
had
brought
the
king
of
lacedæmon
thither
tell
again
the
story
of
your
visit
to
troy
said
nestor
our
guest
good
palamedes
would
fain
understand
it
all
and
i
doubt
not
that
he
may
be
of
service
to
your
cause
then
menelaus
began
once
more
at
the
beginning
there
is
no
need
that
i
should
speak
of
the
long
voyage
to
ilios
or
of
the
causes
which
persuaded
me
to
undertake
it
when
i
drew
near
the
lofty
citadels
of
troy
and
through
the
scæan
gates
could
see
the
rows
of
stately
dwellings
and
athené
s
marble
temple
and
the
busy
of
that
great
city
i
stopped
there
in
wonder
fearing
to
venture
farther
then
i
sent
a
herald
to
the
gates
who
should
make
known
my
name
and
lineage
and
the
errand
upon
which
i
had
come
but
i
waited
without
in
the
shade
of
a
spreading
beech
not
far
from
the
towering
wall
before
me
stood
the
mighty
city
behind
me
the
fertile
plain
sloped
gently
to
the
sea
in
the
distance
i
could
see
the
tomb
of
ilus
and
the
sparkling
waters
of
scamander
while
much
farther
and
on
the
other
side
the
wooded
peak
of
ida
lifted
itself
toward
the
clouds
but
i
had
not
long
to
view
this
scene
for
a
noble
company
of
men
led
by
paris
himself
handsome
as
apollo
came
out
of
the
gates
to
welcome
me
with
words
of
kind
greeting
from
the
king
they
bade
me
enter
within
the
walls
they
led
me
through
the
scæan
gates
and
along
the
streets
until
we
came
at
last
to
priam
s
noble
hall
it
was
a
splendid
house
with
broad
doorways
and
polished
porticos
and
marble
columns
richly
carved
within
were
fifty
chambers
joining
one
another
all
walled
with
polished
stone
in
these
abode
the
fifty
sons
of
priam
with
their
wedded
wives
on
the
other
side
and
opening
into
the
court
were
twelve
chambers
built
for
his
daughters
while
over
all
were
the
for
that
noble
household
and
around
were
galleries
and
stairways
leading
to
the
king
s
great
hall
below
king
priam
received
me
kindly
and
when
he
understood
my
errand
left
naught
undone
to
help
me
forward
with
my
wishes
ten
days
i
abode
as
a
guest
in
his
halls
and
when
i
would
return
to
lacedæmon
he
pressed
me
to
tarry
yet
a
month
in
troy
but
the
winds
were
fair
and
the
oracles
promised
a
pleasant
voyage
and
i
begged
that
on
the
twelfth
day
he
would
let
me
depart
so
he
and
his
sons
brought
many
gifts
rich
and
beautiful
and
laid
them
at
my
feet
a
fair
mantle
and
a
doublet
and
a
talent
of
fine
gold
and
a
sword
with
a
hilt
and
a
richly
engraved
that
i
might
remember
them
when
i
pour
libations
to
the
gods
take
these
gifts
said
priam
as
tokens
of
our
friendship
for
you
and
not
only
for
you
but
for
all
who
dwell
in
distant
hellas
for
we
too
are
the
children
of
the
immortals
our
mighty
ancestor
dardanus
was
the
son
of
zeus
he
it
was
who
built
dardania
on
the
slopes
of
ida
where
the
waters
gush
in
many
silvery
streams
from
underneath
the
rocky
earth
to
dardanus
a
son
was
born
named
erichthonius
who
in
his
time
was
the
richest
of
mortal
men
and
erichthonius
was
the
father
of
tros
to
whom
were
born
three
noble
sons
ilus
assaracus
and
ganymedes
the
last
was
the
handsomest
of
men
and
for
his
beauty
s
sake
the
gods
carried
him
to
ida
s
sacred
summit
to
be
the
of
father
zeus
and
the
companion
of
the
immortals
then
ilus
had
a
son
famous
in
song
and
story
named
laomedon
who
in
his
old
age
became
my
father
he
though
my
sire
did
many
unwise
things
and
brought
sore
distress
upon
the
people
of
this
land
one
day
apollo
and
poseidon
came
to
sacred
troy
disguised
as
humble
wayfarers
seeking
some
employment
this
they
did
because
so
ordered
by
mighty
zeus
what
can
you
do
asked
my
father
when
the
two
had
told
their
wishes
poseidon
answered
i
am
a
builder
of
walls
and
apollo
answered
i
am
a
shepherd
and
a
tender
of
herds
it
is
well
answered
laomedon
the
shall
build
a
wall
around
this
troy
so
high
and
strong
that
no
enemy
can
pass
it
the
shepherd
shall
tend
my
herds
of
kine
in
the
wooded
glens
of
ida
if
at
the
end
of
a
twelvemonth
the
wall
be
built
and
if
the
cattle
thrive
without
loss
of
one
then
i
will
pay
you
your
hire
a
talent
of
gold
two
tripods
of
silver
rich
robes
and
armor
such
as
heroes
wear
so
the
shining
archer
and
the
shaker
of
the
earth
served
my
father
through
the
year
for
the
hire
which
he
had
promised
poseidon
built
a
wall
high
and
fair
around
the
city
and
apollo
tended
the
shambling
kine
and
lost
not
one
but
when
they
claimed
their
hire
laomedon
drove
them
away
with
threats
telling
them
that
he
would
bind
their
feet
and
hands
together
and
sell
them
as
slaves
into
some
distant
land
having
first
sheared
off
their
ears
with
his
sharp
sword
and
the
twain
went
away
with
angry
hearts
planning
in
their
minds
how
they
might
avenge
themselves
back
to
his
watery
kingdom
and
his
golden
palace
beneath
the
sea
went
great
poseidon
he
harnessed
his
steeds
to
his
chariot
and
rode
forth
upon
the
waves
he
loosed
the
mighty
winds
from
their
and
sent
them
raging
over
the
sea
the
angry
waters
rushed
in
upon
the
land
they
covered
the
pastures
and
the
rich
plain
of
troy
and
threatened
even
to
beat
down
the
mighty
walls
which
their
king
had
built
then
little
by
little
the
flood
shrank
back
again
and
the
people
went
out
of
the
city
to
see
the
waste
of
slime
and
black
mud
which
covered
their
meadows
while
they
were
gazing
upon
the
scene
a
fearful
monster
sent
by
angry
poseidon
came
up
out
of
the
sea
and
fell
upon
them
and
drove
them
with
hideous
slaughter
back
to
the
city
gates
neither
would
he
allow
any
one
to
come
outside
of
the
walls
then
my
father
in
his
great
distress
clad
himself
in
mourning
and
went
in
deep
humility
to
the
temple
of
athené
where
stands
the
statue
which
we
call
palladion
in
sore
distress
he
called
unto
the
goddess
and
besought
to
know
the
means
whereby
the
anger
of
poseidon
might
be
assuaged
and
in
solemn
tones
a
voice
came
from
the
moveless
lips
of
the
palladion
saying
every
day
one
of
the
maidens
of
troy
must
be
fed
to
the
monster
outside
of
the
walls
the
shaker
of
the
earth
has
spoken
disobey
him
not
lest
more
cruel
punishments
befall
thee
then
in
every
house
of
troy
there
was
sore
distress
and
lamentation
for
no
one
knew
upon
whom
the
doom
would
soonest
fall
and
every
day
a
hapless
maiden
young
and
fair
was
chained
to
the
great
rock
by
the
shore
and
left
there
to
be
the
food
of
the
pitiless
monster
and
the
people
cried
aloud
in
their
distress
and
cursed
the
mighty
walls
and
the
high
towers
which
had
been
reared
by
the
unpaid
labors
of
poseidon
and
my
father
sat
upon
his
high
seat
and
trembled
because
of
the
dire
calamities
which
his
own
deeds
had
brought
upon
his
people
at
last
after
many
humbler
victims
had
perished
the
lot
fell
upon
the
fairest
of
my
sisters
hesione
my
father
s
daughter
in
sorrow
we
arrayed
her
in
garments
befitting
one
doomed
to
an
untimely
death
and
when
we
had
bidden
her
a
last
farewell
we
gave
her
to
the
heralds
to
lead
forth
to
the
place
of
sacrifice
just
then
however
a
noble
stranger
taller
and
more
stately
than
any
man
in
troy
came
down
the
street
from
the
scæan
gate
and
handsome
and
strong
he
seemed
a
very
god
to
all
who
looked
upon
him
over
his
shoulder
he
wore
the
tawny
skin
of
a
mighty
lion
while
in
his
hand
he
carried
a
club
most
wonderful
to
behold
and
the
people
as
he
passed
prayed
him
that
he
would
free
our
city
from
the
dread
monster
who
was
robbing
us
of
our
fair
loved
ones
i
know
that
thou
art
a
god
cried
my
father
when
he
saw
the
stranger
i
pray
thee
save
my
daughter
who
even
now
is
being
led
forth
to
a
cruel
death
you
make
mistake
answered
the
fair
stranger
i
am
not
one
of
the
gods
my
name
is
heracles
and
like
you
i
am
mortal
yet
i
may
help
you
in
this
your
time
of
need
now
in
my
father
s
stables
there
were
twelve
fair
steeds
the
best
that
the
earth
ever
knew
so
light
of
foot
were
they
that
when
they
bounded
over
the
land
they
might
run
upon
the
topmost
ears
of
ripened
corn
and
break
them
not
and
when
they
bounded
over
the
sea
not
even
poseidon
s
steeds
could
glide
so
lightly
upon
the
crests
of
the
waves
some
say
they
were
the
steeds
of
boreas
given
to
my
grandfather
tros
by
his
sire
erichthonius
others
that
they
were
the
price
which
zeus
paid
for
godlike
ganymedes
most
beautiful
of
men
these
steeds
my
father
promised
to
give
to
heracles
if
he
would
save
hesione
then
the
heralds
led
my
fair
sister
to
the
shore
and
chained
her
to
the
rock
there
to
wait
for
the
coming
of
the
monster
but
heracles
stood
near
her
fearless
in
his
strength
soon
the
waves
began
to
rise
the
waters
were
disturbed
and
the
great
beast
with
hoarse
bellowings
lifted
his
head
above
the
breakers
and
rushed
forward
to
seize
his
fair
prey
then
the
hero
sprang
to
meet
him
with
blow
upon
blow
from
his
mighty
club
he
felled
the
monster
the
waters
of
the
sea
were
reddened
with
blood
hesione
was
saved
and
troy
was
freed
from
the
dreadful
curse
behold
thy
daughter
said
heracles
leading
her
gently
back
to
the
scæan
gate
and
giving
her
to
her
father
i
have
saved
her
from
the
jaws
of
death
and
delivered
your
country
from
the
dread
scourge
give
me
now
my
shame
fills
my
heart
as
i
tell
this
story
for
thanklessness
was
the
bane
of
my
father
s
life
ungrateful
to
the
hero
who
had
risked
so
much
and
done
so
much
that
our
homes
and
our
country
might
be
saved
from
ruin
he
turned
coldly
away
from
heracles
then
he
shut
the
great
gates
in
his
face
and
barred
him
out
of
the
city
and
taunted
him
from
the
walls
saying
i
owe
thee
no
hire
begone
from
our
coasts
ere
i
scourge
thee
hence
full
of
wrath
the
hero
turned
away
i
go
but
i
will
come
again
he
said
then
peace
and
plenty
blessed
once
more
the
land
of
ilios
and
men
forgot
the
perils
from
which
they
had
been
delivered
but
ere
long
great
heracles
returned
as
he
had
promised
and
with
him
came
a
mighty
fleet
of
ships
and
many
warriors
neither
gates
nor
strong
walls
could
stand
against
him
into
the
city
he
marched
and
straight
to
my
father
s
palace
all
fled
before
him
and
the
strongest
warriors
quailed
beneath
his
glance
here
in
this
very
court
he
slew
my
father
and
my
brothers
with
his
terrible
arrows
i
myself
would
have
fallen
before
his
wrath
had
not
my
sister
fair
hesione
pleaded
for
my
life
i
spare
his
life
said
heracles
in
answer
to
her
prayers
for
he
is
but
a
lad
yet
he
must
be
my
slave
until
you
have
paid
a
price
for
him
and
thus
redeemed
him
then
hesione
took
the
golden
veil
from
her
head
and
gave
it
to
the
hero
as
my
purchase
price
and
thenceforward
i
was
called
priam
or
the
purchased
for
the
name
which
my
mother
gave
me
was
podarkes
or
the
after
this
heracles
and
his
heroes
went
on
board
their
ships
and
sailed
back
across
the
sea
leaving
me
alone
in
my
father
s
halls
for
they
took
fair
hesione
with
them
and
carried
her
to
salamis
to
be
the
wife
of
telamon
the
sire
of
mighty
ajax
there
through
these
long
years
she
has
lived
in
sorrow
far
removed
from
home
and
friends
and
the
scenes
of
her
happy
childhood
and
now
that
the
hero
telamon
to
whom
she
was
wedded
lives
no
longer
i
ween
that
her
life
is
indeed
a
cheerless
when
priam
had
finished
his
tale
he
drew
his
seat
still
nearer
mine
and
looked
into
my
face
with
anxious
beseeching
eyes
then
he
said
i
have
long
wished
to
send
a
ship
across
the
sea
to
bring
my
sister
back
to
troy
a
vessel
built
for
speed
and
safety
lies
now
at
anchor
in
the
harbor
and
a
picked
crew
is
ready
to
embark
at
any
moment
and
here
is
my
son
paris
handsome
and
brave
who
is
anxious
to
make
voyage
to
salamis
to
seek
unhappy
hesione
yet
our
seamen
having
never
ventured
far
from
home
know
nothing
of
the
dangers
of
the
deep
nor
do
they
feel
sure
that
they
can
find
their
way
to
hellas
and
so
we
have
a
favor
to
ask
of
you
and
that
is
that
when
your
ship
sails
ours
may
follow
in
its
wake
across
the
i
was
glad
when
priam
spoke
these
words
for
in
truth
i
was
loath
to
part
with
paris
and
i
arranged
at
once
that
he
should
bear
me
company
in
my
own
swift
ship
while
his
vessel
with
its
crew
followed
not
far
behind
and
so
with
favoring
winds
being
blessed
we
made
a
quick
voyage
back
to
lacedæmon
bringing
with
us
the
bones
of
my
beloved
countrymen
what
followed
is
too
sad
for
lengthy
mention
and
is
in
part
already
known
to
you
need
i
tell
you
how
i
opened
my
halls
to
paris
and
left
no
act
of
courtesy
undone
that
i
might
make
him
happy
need
i
tell
you
how
he
was
welcomed
by
fair
helen
and
how
the
summer
days
fled
by
on
golden
wings
and
how
in
the
delights
of
lacedæmon
he
forgot
his
errand
to
salamis
and
cared
only
to
remain
with
me
my
honored
guest
and
trusted
friend
one
day
a
message
came
to
me
from
my
old
friend
idomeneus
he
had
planned
a
hunt
among
the
mountains
and
wooded
vales
of
crete
and
he
invited
me
to
join
him
in
the
sport
i
had
not
seen
idomeneus
since
the
time
that
we
together
in
friendly
contention
sought
the
hand
of
helen
i
could
not
do
otherwise
than
accept
his
invitation
for
he
had
sent
his
own
ship
to
carry
me
over
to
crete
so
i
bade
farewell
to
helen
saying
let
not
our
noble
guest
lack
entertainment
while
i
am
gone
and
may
the
golden
hours
glide
happily
until
i
come
and
to
paris
i
said
tarry
another
moon
in
lacedæmon
and
when
i
return
from
crete
i
will
go
with
you
to
salamis
and
aid
you
in
your
search
for
then
i
went
on
board
the
waiting
ship
and
prospering
breezes
carried
us
without
delays
to
crete
idomeneus
received
me
joyfully
and
entertained
me
most
royally
in
his
palace
and
for
nine
days
we
feasted
in
his
halls
and
made
all
things
ready
for
the
hunt
but
lo
on
the
evening
of
the
last
day
a
vision
came
to
me
iris
the
messenger
of
the
gods
stood
before
me
hasten
back
to
lacedæmon
she
cried
for
thou
art
robbed
of
thy
dearest
treasure
and
even
while
she
spoke
one
of
my
own
ships
came
sailing
into
the
harbor
bringing
trusted
heralds
whom
the
elders
of
lacedæmon
had
sent
to
me
they
told
me
the
fatal
news
no
sooner
were
you
well
on
your
way
they
said
than
paris
began
to
put
his
ship
in
readiness
to
depart
helen
prayed
him
to
tarry
until
your
return
but
he
would
not
hearken
i
will
stay
no
longer
he
said
my
seamen
rest
upon
their
oars
the
sails
of
my
ship
are
spread
the
breeze
will
soon
spring
up
that
will
carry
me
to
my
own
fair
home
across
the
sea
but
you
beauteous
helen
shall
go
with
me
for
the
deathless
gods
have
spoken
it
aphrodite
long
ago
promised
that
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
the
world
should
be
my
wife
and
who
is
that
most
beautiful
woman
if
it
is
not
yourself
come
fly
over
the
sea
and
be
my
queen
it
is
the
will
of
the
gods
it
was
thus
that
the
perfidious
trojan
wrought
the
ruin
of
all
that
was
dear
to
me
at
first
helen
refused
but
paris
is
a
handsome
prince
and
day
after
day
he
renewed
his
suit
then
on
the
sixth
day
she
yielded
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
they
went
on
board
his
waiting
vessel
carrying
with
them
the
gold
and
jewels
of
my
and
in
the
morning
when
the
sun
arose
on
lacedæmon
they
were
far
out
at
sea
you
know
the
rest
how
in
wrath
and
great
sorrow
i
hurried
home
from
crete
how
i
first
counselled
with
my
own
elders
and
then
with
my
brother
agamemnon
of
mycenæ
and
now
o
noble
nestor
we
have
come
to
pylos
seeking
thy
advice
on
these
two
things
my
mind
is
set
helen
must
be
mine
again
and
paris
must
suffer
the
punishment
due
to
traitors
when
menelaus
had
ended
sage
nestor
answered
with
many
words
of
counsel
keep
the
thought
of
vengeance
ever
before
you
he
said
yet
act
not
rashly
the
power
of
troy
is
very
great
and
in
case
of
war
all
the
tribes
of
asia
will
make
common
cause
with
ilios
but
an
insult
to
lacedæmon
is
an
insult
to
all
hellas
and
every
loyal
hellene
will
hasten
to
avenge
it
more
than
this
the
chiefs
of
almost
every
state
have
already
sworn
to
aid
you
we
have
but
to
call
upon
them
and
remind
them
of
their
oaths
and
all
the
mightiest
warriors
of
our
land
will
take
up
arms
against
the
power
of
troy
then
palamedes
spoke
in
like
manner
and
his
words
had
great
weight
with
menelaus
for
among
all
the
heroes
there
were
few
who
equalled
him
in
wisdom
he
it
was
who
first
built
beacon
fires
on
the
headlands
and
lighthouses
to
warn
venturous
seamen
of
the
hidden
dangers
in
their
way
he
it
was
who
first
invented
scales
for
weighing
and
who
taught
men
how
to
measure
grain
and
wine
by
certain
standards
he
it
was
who
first
made
dice
and
who
showed
what
beauty
and
mystery
lie
hidden
in
the
letters
which
cadmus
brought
from
phoenicia
to
hellas
and
he
was
wise
in
statecraft
and
the
knowledge
of
human
nature
nestor
has
spoken
well
he
said
addressing
menelaus
and
it
behooves
us
to
follow
his
advice
now
do
you
and
agamemnon
return
at
once
to
argos
and
lacedæmon
and
call
upon
the
fighting
men
along
the
eastern
coast
to
join
you
in
the
war
in
the
mean
while
nestor
and
myself
will
do
the
same
here
on
the
western
coast
and
among
the
islands
of
the
sea
by
the
way
said
nestor
there
is
odysseus
king
of
ithaca
the
rarest
and
bravest
of
men
did
he
but
know
of
this
affair
he
would
be
a
host
within
himself
to
lead
us
to
sure
victory
that
is
true
said
palamedes
and
we
must
seek
his
aid
first
my
ship
lies
now
at
anchor
just
off
the
beach
and
if
noble
nestor
will
be
my
comrade
we
will
sail
to
ithaca
and
make
sure
of
his
valued
aid
most
surely
i
will
go
with
you
said
old
nestor
and
i
will
never
rest
nor
give
up
the
fight
until
helen
is
returned
to
menelaus
and
paris
has
received
his
due
reward
xviii
unwilling
hero
in
the
shade
of
the
orchard
trees
at
the
foot
of
mount
neritus
there
was
gathered
one
afternoon
a
happy
family
party
the
chief
figure
in
the
group
was
laertes
in
his
gardener
s
garb
picking
some
ripe
fruit
from
the
overloaded
branches
at
his
right
stood
anticleia
as
queenly
beautiful
as
when
her
had
won
her
in
the
halls
of
old
autolycus
at
his
left
was
penelope
her
sweet
face
beaming
with
smiles
while
on
the
ground
beside
her
sat
odysseus
gently
dandling
in
his
arms
the
babe
telemachus
and
laughing
at
the
budding
wisdom
of
the
child
some
men
wander
the
wide
world
over
seeking
for
empty
glory
said
he
turning
towards
penelope
but
i
would
rather
have
my
pleasant
home
and
live
amid
its
delights
than
share
the
honors
even
of
great
heracles
at
this
moment
phemius
the
bard
was
seen
coming
in
haste
from
the
palace
what
news
phemius
asked
odysseus
hast
thou
finished
that
new
song
of
thine
and
dost
thou
hasten
thus
to
sing
it
to
us
before
some
part
of
it
shall
go
out
of
thy
mind
nay
master
answered
the
bard
speaking
in
anxious
tones
i
have
come
to
tell
you
that
there
are
guests
waiting
in
the
hall
famous
men
they
are
even
nestor
king
of
pylos
and
shrewd
palamedes
of
eubœa
and
they
bring
wonderful
news
news
of
that
which
will
perchance
fill
our
land
with
sadness
tell
me
what
it
is
said
odysseus
then
the
bard
told
the
story
of
paris
and
helen
as
he
had
learned
it
briefly
from
palamedes
and
he
explained
the
errand
of
the
which
they
had
thoughtlessly
imparted
to
him
odysseus
looked
at
his
smiling
babe
and
at
his
fair
wife
and
his
loved
mother
and
his
honored
father
and
his
brow
darkened
as
he
shook
his
head
and
said
why
should
i
risk
so
much
and
joining
in
this
war
leave
all
that
is
dear
to
me
on
earth
simply
for
the
sake
of
menelaus
and
his
misguided
helen
then
after
a
moment
s
thought
he
added
i
will
not
go
tell
nestor
and
palamedes
that
i
am
mad
and
can
not
go
all
at
once
a
great
change
seemed
to
come
over
him
he
put
the
babe
into
its
nurse
s
arms
and
then
with
long
strides
and
in
the
aimless
manner
of
a
maniac
he
made
his
way
across
the
orchard
and
along
the
footpath
by
the
beach
to
the
white
palace
near
the
shore
when
his
old
friends
nestor
and
palamedes
saw
him
they
hastened
towards
him
expecting
to
receive
his
greeting
but
with
unmeaning
words
and
a
vacant
stare
he
passed
by
them
without
a
word
of
recognition
he
is
mad
said
the
frightened
servants
as
they
fled
before
him
yes
he
is
mad
and
knows
not
where
he
is
nor
what
he
does
said
phemius
hastily
rejoining
the
guests
when
i
went
out
to
find
him
just
now
he
was
wandering
among
the
fruit
trees
picking
the
green
fruit
and
roaring
like
a
wild
beast
the
gods
have
taken
his
reason
from
him
how
sad
that
so
great
a
mind
should
be
thus
clouded
answered
nestor
with
a
sigh
and
at
this
time
it
is
doubly
sad
for
us
and
for
all
who
love
him
for
we
had
counted
on
great
things
from
shrewd
odysseus
surely
some
unfriendly
god
has
done
this
thing
with
intent
to
harm
all
hellas
do
not
judge
hastily
whispered
palamedes
we
shall
find
out
from
whence
this
madness
comes
illustration
palamedes
tests
the
madness
of
odysseus
soon
odysseus
rushed
from
his
chamber
looking
wildly
about
him
as
if
the
very
furies
were
at
his
heels
he
was
dressed
in
his
richest
garments
and
on
his
shoulder
he
carried
a
bag
of
salt
without
speaking
to
any
one
he
made
his
way
to
the
stables
where
with
his
own
hands
he
harnessed
a
mule
and
a
cow
and
yoked
them
side
by
side
to
a
plough
then
he
drove
his
strange
team
down
to
the
beach
and
began
to
plough
long
deep
furrows
in
the
sand
by
and
by
he
opened
the
bag
of
salt
and
strewed
the
white
grains
here
and
there
as
though
he
were
sowing
seed
this
strange
work
he
continued
until
the
daylight
faded
into
darkness
and
all
the
people
were
fain
to
seek
rest
under
their
then
he
drove
his
team
back
to
the
stables
unyoked
the
beasts
and
fed
them
and
hurried
silently
to
his
chamber
the
next
morning
as
soon
as
the
dawn
appeared
he
was
seen
ploughing
the
sandy
beach
as
before
i
will
see
whether
there
be
any
reason
in
his
madness
said
palamedes
to
nestor
it
chanced
at
that
moment
that
eurycleia
the
nurse
was
passing
by
with
little
telemachus
in
her
arms
without
another
word
palamedes
lifted
the
babe
and
laid
it
smiling
in
the
last
furrow
that
odysseus
had
made
so
that
on
his
next
round
the
team
would
trample
upon
it
as
odysseus
drew
near
urging
forward
the
mule
and
the
cow
with
many
cries
and
maniacal
gestures
he
saw
the
helpless
babe
the
sight
of
its
danger
made
him
forget
himself
and
his
assumed
madness
he
turned
his
team
aside
and
running
forward
seized
telemachus
and
kissing
his
laughing
lips
handed
him
with
every
show
of
gentleness
to
the
good
nurse
ha
odysseus
cried
palamedes
thou
canst
not
deceive
us
thou
art
no
more
mad
than
i
am
cease
now
that
boyish
play
and
come
and
talk
with
us
as
becometh
a
hero
then
odysseus
seeing
that
he
had
been
fairly
outwitted
by
one
as
shrewd
as
himself
knew
that
further
pretence
of
madness
would
avail
him
nothing
for
a
single
moment
his
brow
was
clouded
with
anger
and
he
whispered
hoarsely
to
palamedes
you
shall
have
your
reward
for
this
then
leaving
his
plough
and
his
team
upon
the
beach
he
took
his
two
guests
kindly
by
the
hand
and
led
them
into
his
palace
a
great
feast
was
spread
upon
the
tables
and
the
morning
was
spent
in
eating
and
and
not
a
word
was
said
concerning
the
great
business
which
had
brought
the
kings
to
ithaca
see
note
at
the
end
of
this
volume
later
in
the
day
however
nestor
told
odysseus
the
story
of
the
perfidy
of
paris
then
palamedes
followed
with
a
speech
so
clear
so
forcible
that
the
hearts
of
all
who
heard
it
were
stirred
to
their
very
depths
and
odysseus
rising
from
his
seat
renewed
the
vow
which
he
had
made
when
menelaus
won
fair
helen
for
his
bride
and
from
that
time
to
the
very
end
there
was
not
a
man
among
all
the
hellenes
who
threw
himself
more
earnestly
into
the
work
than
did
odysseus
for
seven
days
nestor
and
palamedes
tarried
at
ithaca
talking
with
odysseus
and
making
plans
for
the
war
against
troy
on
the
eighth
day
the
three
heroes
embarked
for
the
mainland
and
for
months
they
journeyed
from
country
to
country
and
from
city
to
city
reminding
the
princes
of
their
vows
and
stirring
all
hellas
into
a
flame
soon
the
were
kindled
on
every
and
every
warrior
in
the
land
made
haste
to
see
that
his
arms
were
in
order
and
every
seaman
to
put
his
ship
to
rights
and
ares
the
mighty
god
of
battle
brandished
his
sword
above
the
sea
dread
comets
blazed
red
in
glittering
stars
fell
to
the
earth
or
shot
gleaming
athwart
the
sky
sounds
of
warlike
preparation
were
heard
not
only
in
the
dwellings
of
men
but
even
in
the
halls
of
zeus
upon
the
airy
summit
of
olympus
xix
in
strange
garb
there
dwelt
at
mycenæ
a
wise
soothsayer
named
calchas
a
man
versed
in
all
the
lore
of
earth
and
sky
and
holding
some
sort
of
communion
with
the
immortals
he
could
lift
the
veil
of
the
future
and
see
what
to
other
men
lay
hidden
in
the
darkness
and
next
to
the
pythian
oracle
at
delphi
or
the
talking
oak
of
dodona
he
was
held
in
high
repute
as
knowing
the
counsels
of
the
gods
when
all
the
great
chiefs
sat
one
day
in
agamemnon
s
hall
and
talked
of
their
warriors
and
their
ships
and
their
arms
and
boasted
of
their
readiness
to
sail
at
once
for
ilios
the
old
soothsayer
came
and
stood
before
them
his
white
locks
streamed
in
flowing
waves
about
his
shoulders
his
gray
eyes
gleamed
with
a
strange
wild
light
he
moved
his
long
arms
to
and
fro
above
his
head
and
pointed
with
his
thin
fingers
first
towards
the
sky
and
then
towards
the
sea
hearken
ye
to
the
seer
said
menelaus
he
has
had
a
vision
and
perchance
he
can
tell
us
how
we
shall
fare
in
this
great
business
which
we
have
undertaken
then
calchas
spoke
and
said
verily
i
know
not
any
thing
of
this
matter
save
by
the
gift
of
soothsaying
which
the
apollo
has
bestowed
upon
me
yet
when
i
inquired
of
him
this
answer
did
he
give
let
the
hellenes
make
war
upon
troy
they
shall
not
prevail
against
that
city
unless
achilles
the
dear
son
of
thetis
lead
send
now
for
him
and
enlist
him
in
your
cause
for
otherwise
you
shall
fail
and
the
trojans
shall
boast
of
your
ruin
having
said
these
words
the
seer
strode
from
the
hall
leaving
the
hero
chiefs
alone
for
a
time
they
sat
in
silence
each
pondering
the
matter
in
his
own
mind
then
agamemnon
spoke
and
his
words
were
full
of
anger
and
unbelief
never
yet
said
he
did
calchas
prophesy
any
thing
but
ill
he
sees
naught
but
evil
and
when
we
feel
most
sure
of
success
then
it
is
the
joy
of
his
heart
to
foretell
failure
now
after
the
gods
have
thus
far
favored
us
and
when
all
things
are
in
readiness
for
the
gathering
together
of
our
forces
this
woful
soothsayer
comes
to
tell
us
that
without
achilles
we
shall
fail
for
my
part
i
care
little
for
his
words
and
am
willing
to
run
all
risks
say
not
so
quickly
answered
odysseus
the
old
man
speaks
as
apollo
gives
him
utterance
and
no
man
shall
dare
put
his
judgment
in
the
scales
against
the
foreknowledge
of
the
gods
let
us
seek
achilles
at
once
and
persuade
him
to
join
us
in
our
league
against
ilios
but
who
shall
find
him
asked
menelaus
two
months
ago
i
was
in
iolcos
by
the
sea
whither
i
had
gone
to
see
old
peleus
i
found
that
that
aged
king
dwelt
no
longer
in
the
ancient
city
but
had
removed
into
his
own
country
of
phthia
and
there
abode
among
his
myrmidons
into
phthia
therefore
i
went
hoping
to
find
achilles
also
there
but
old
peleus
wept
when
i
asked
about
his
son
in
truth
i
know
not
where
the
young
man
is
he
said
in
answer
to
my
questions
for
when
the
news
was
noised
about
that
the
chiefs
of
hellas
were
planning
war
upon
troy
then
thetis
carried
her
son
into
some
distant
unknown
land
and
hid
him
there
for
the
fates
have
declared
the
doom
of
achilles
that
his
days
on
earth
shall
be
few
but
glorious
and
his
mother
feared
that
should
he
join
in
the
great
war
he
would
meet
an
untimely
death
thus
then
it
is
that
i
am
bereft
already
of
my
only
son
for
i
know
not
whether
i
shall
ever
again
behold
in
this
manner
peleus
the
lord
of
horses
bewailed
the
absence
of
his
son
and
though
in
every
city
i
sought
news
concerning
the
whereabouts
of
the
young
hero
i
could
learn
nothing
whatever
even
patroclus
his
bosom
friend
and
comrade
wept
for
him
as
for
one
dead
i
do
not
believe
that
he
can
be
found
in
hellas
then
nestor
the
wise
arose
and
spoke
it
does
not
become
us
he
said
to
doubt
or
dispute
the
words
of
calchas
the
seer
therefore
we
must
find
achilles
and
win
him
to
our
cause
or
laying
aside
all
thought
of
war
we
must
humbly
surrender
to
paris
the
noblest
treasure
of
our
country
even
beauteous
helen
achilles
can
be
found
said
odysseus
i
myself
will
seek
him
and
the
moon
shall
not
wane
thrice
ere
i
shall
have
found
him
let
the
best
ship
in
argos
be
put
in
readiness
at
once
and
let
a
crew
of
the
most
skilful
oarsmen
be
chosen
and
a
good
store
of
food
be
put
into
the
hold
i
will
embark
and
you
shall
see
me
no
more
until
i
bring
good
news
of
thetis
s
godlike
son
so
then
odysseus
set
sail
on
a
long
uncertain
voyage
to
the
islands
of
the
sea
in
search
of
the
hidden
hero
vainly
did
he
visit
cythera
the
lofty
isle
where
aphrodite
first
rose
in
all
her
beauty
from
the
salt
he
touched
at
melos
rich
in
corn
and
wine
he
skirted
paros
known
to
all
the
world
for
its
figs
and
its
spotless
marble
he
stopped
for
a
month
at
sacred
delos
the
birthplace
of
apollo
he
explored
ophiussa
where
serpents
curse
the
ground
and
grapes
grow
purple
on
the
climbing
vines
he
sought
long
time
in
andros
among
the
groves
and
in
the
temple
sacred
to
dionysus
yet
in
none
of
these
lands
heard
he
any
news
of
the
godlike
son
of
peleus
weary
of
their
long
and
fruitless
voyage
the
comrades
of
odysseus
murmured
sorely
and
besought
him
to
return
to
mycenæ
and
give
up
the
search
but
he
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
their
pleadings
and
sailed
away
to
scyros
where
old
lycomedes
reigned
for
the
goddess
athené
had
whispered
to
him
in
a
dream
and
told
him
that
in
the
court
of
lycomedes
he
would
find
the
hero
for
whom
he
sought
in
a
narrow
inlet
hidden
by
trees
and
tall
reeds
the
ship
was
moored
while
shrewd
odysseus
went
alone
and
unheralded
to
the
palace
of
the
king
he
had
laid
aside
his
warrior
s
gear
and
was
now
attired
in
the
guise
of
a
wandering
peddler
and
loaded
with
a
heavy
pack
of
precious
wares
and
lo
as
he
neared
the
halls
of
lycomedes
he
came
to
a
spacious
garden
just
outside
of
the
courtyard
and
hard
by
the
lofty
gate
a
green
hedge
ran
round
it
on
four
sides
while
within
grew
many
tall
trees
laden
with
fruits
and
blossoms
pear
trees
pomegranates
apple
trees
and
olives
so
well
cared
for
were
these
trees
that
they
yielded
fruit
in
every
season
of
the
year
nor
ever
failed
even
in
winter
time
beyond
these
all
manner
of
garden
beds
were
planted
where
flowers
bloomed
in
freshness
the
dewy
lotus
the
crocus
flower
the
pale
hyacinth
violets
asphodels
and
fair
lilies
and
in
their
midst
two
springs
of
water
gushed
one
of
them
watered
the
garden
and
the
fields
beyond
the
other
ran
close
by
the
threshold
of
the
palace
and
bubbled
up
in
the
where
all
the
people
came
to
fill
their
vessels
see
note
at
the
end
of
this
volume
as
odysseus
stood
and
gazed
in
rapt
delight
upon
this
scene
of
beauty
a
party
of
happy
maidens
came
through
the
courtyard
and
stopped
in
the
garden
to
pluck
the
fruits
and
flowers
then
on
the
open
lawn
they
fell
to
playing
ball
and
one
among
them
sang
a
lightsome
song
as
they
tossed
the
missile
to
and
fro
or
danced
with
happy
feet
upon
the
sward
when
they
saw
odysseus
standing
in
the
path
they
stopped
their
game
and
stood
silent
in
their
places
scarce
knowing
whether
to
advance
and
greet
the
stranger
kindly
or
in
girlish
timidness
to
flee
into
the
palace
the
hero
opened
then
his
peddler
s
pack
and
held
up
to
their
delighted
gaze
a
golden
necklace
set
with
amber
beads
no
further
thought
of
flight
had
the
maidens
now
with
eager
yet
hesitating
feet
they
came
crowding
around
him
anxious
to
see
what
other
thing
of
beauty
he
had
brought
with
him
one
by
one
he
showed
them
all
his
treasures
bracelets
of
finest
workmanship
clasps
buckles
headbands
and
golden
these
they
took
in
their
hands
and
passing
them
from
one
to
another
eagerly
debated
the
price
one
only
of
the
company
taller
and
nobler
than
the
others
stood
aloof
and
seemed
to
care
nothing
for
the
rich
and
handsome
ornaments
odysseus
noticed
this
but
shrewdly
kept
his
counsels
to
himself
a
merchant
like
myself
said
he
must
needs
have
goods
for
all
for
the
young
as
well
as
for
the
old
for
the
grave
as
well
as
for
the
gay
for
the
hero
as
well
as
for
the
lady
it
is
his
duty
no
less
than
his
delight
to
please
with
these
words
he
laid
before
the
maidens
a
sword
with
hilt
most
deftly
carved
a
dagger
with
long
keen
blade
and
a
helmet
thickly
inlaid
with
precious
gems
the
one
who
had
not
cared
to
look
at
the
trinkets
now
started
quickly
as
if
a
trumpet
had
blown
she
took
up
the
sword
and
handled
it
like
a
warrior
long
used
to
weapons
she
tested
the
edge
of
the
dagger
and
sounded
the
strength
of
the
helmet
odysseus
had
learned
all
that
he
wished
to
know
he
thought
no
more
of
the
ornaments
the
bracelets
the
clasps
and
the
but
gave
them
to
the
maidens
for
any
price
that
they
chose
to
offer
when
all
were
pleased
and
satisfied
he
turned
to
that
one
still
toying
with
the
sword
and
said
sharply
achilles
had
an
earthquake
shaken
the
isle
of
scyros
at
that
moment
achilles
would
not
have
been
more
startled
for
the
tall
fair
body
clad
in
a
maiden
s
robes
was
none
other
than
that
hero
achilles
again
said
odysseus
i
know
thee
and
it
is
useless
to
struggle
longer
against
thy
destiny
put
off
that
unbecoming
garb
and
come
with
me
thy
countrymen
need
thee
to
aid
them
in
waging
bitter
war
against
troy
then
he
told
to
the
listening
hero
the
story
of
the
great
wrong
which
paris
had
done
the
unbearable
insult
which
he
had
put
upon
the
folk
of
hellas
no
man
ever
used
words
more
persuasive
when
he
had
ended
achilles
took
him
by
the
hand
and
said
odysseus
truly
do
i
know
the
destiny
which
is
mine
and
it
behooves
no
man
to
struggle
long
against
the
doom
which
has
been
allotted
to
him
for
the
gods
ordain
that
man
should
live
in
pain
while
they
themselves
are
sorrowless
you
have
heard
it
said
how
on
the
threshold
of
zeus
there
stand
two
caskets
full
of
gifts
to
men
one
casket
holds
the
evil
and
one
the
good
and
to
whomsoever
is
dealt
a
mingled
lot
upon
him
misfortunes
sometimes
fall
and
sometimes
blessings
so
it
is
with
me
and
with
my
father
s
house
for
upon
peleus
were
bestowed
rich
gifts
even
from
his
birth
and
he
excelled
all
other
men
in
good
fortune
and
in
wealth
and
he
was
king
over
the
myrmidons
and
to
him
was
given
a
for
a
wife
even
thetis
my
yet
with
all
the
good
sorrow
has
come
upon
him
in
his
old
age
for
in
his
halls
there
are
no
kingly
sons
to
gladden
his
heart
and
hold
up
his
hands
i
am
his
only
son
and
of
me
it
has
been
written
that
i
am
doomed
to
an
untimely
death
and
it
was
for
this
that
thetis
brought
me
hither
across
the
sea
and
clothing
me
in
maidenly
attire
left
me
to
serve
in
lycomedes
pleasant
halls
but
i
tire
of
life
like
this
i
would
rather
die
a
hero
in
some
grand
struggle
than
live
a
hundred
years
among
these
soft
delights
i
will
sail
with
you
at
once
for
phthia
where
my
father
sits
already
bereaved
in
his
spacious
halls
there
i
will
summon
my
myrmidons
and
my
friend
patroclus
and
then
with
eager
hearts
we
will
hasten
to
join
our
countrymen
in
war
against
the
trojan
power
see
note
at
the
end
of
this
volume
thus
then
did
odysseus
perform
his
quest
and
thus
the
last
and
greatest
ally
was
won
to
the
hellenic
cause
and
yet
the
war
was
long
delayed
many
times
did
the
moon
wax
and
wane
and
and
harvest
and
and
the
storms
of
winter
came
again
and
again
in
their
turn
and
still
the
heroes
were
unready
to
join
their
forces
and
enter
upon
the
mighty
struggle
at
length
however
after
nearly
ten
years
had
passed
all
the
princes
and
warriors
of
hellas
gathered
their
ships
and
men
together
at
aulis
and
along
the
shores
of
the
euripus
a
thousand
vessels
were
moored
in
the
strait
and
a
hundred
thousand
brave
men
were
on
board
ready
to
follow
their
leaders
whithersoever
they
should
order
chief
of
all
that
host
was
mighty
agamemnon
king
of
men
bearing
the
sceptre
of
mycenæ
which
hephaestus
long
before
had
wrought
most
wondrously
he
was
clad
in
flashing
armor
and
his
mind
was
filled
with
overweening
pride
when
he
thought
how
high
he
stood
among
the
warriors
and
that
his
men
were
the
goodliest
and
bravest
of
all
that
host
next
to
him
was
menelaus
silent
and
discreet
by
no
means
skilled
above
his
fellows
and
yet
by
reason
of
his
noble
heart
beloved
and
honored
by
all
the
greeks
and
it
was
to
avenge
his
wrongs
that
this
mighty
array
of
men
and
ships
had
been
gathered
together
odysseus
came
next
shrewd
in
counsels
and
no
longer
an
unwilling
hero
but
earnest
and
active
he
moved
among
the
men
and
ships
inspiring
all
with
zeal
and
courage
he
wore
upon
his
shoulders
a
thick
purple
mantle
clasped
with
a
golden
brooch
of
curious
workmanship
which
penelope
had
given
to
him
as
a
parting
gift
around
his
waist
was
a
shining
tunic
soft
and
smooth
and
bright
as
the
sunshine
with
him
wherever
he
went
was
his
herald
and
eurybates
a
hunchbacked
man
whom
odysseus
held
in
high
esteem
because
of
his
rare
good
sense
there
also
was
young
achilles
tall
and
handsome
and
swift
of
foot
his
long
hair
fell
about
his
shoulders
like
a
shower
of
gold
and
his
gray
eyes
gleamed
like
those
of
the
mountain
eagle
by
the
shore
lay
his
trim
ships
fifty
in
all
with
thousands
of
gallant
myrmidons
on
board
and
ever
at
his
side
was
his
bosom
friend
and
comrade
patroclus
the
son
of
menoitios
he
it
was
to
whom
old
peleus
had
said
when
they
were
about
embarking
for
aulis
thou
art
older
than
my
child
achilles
but
he
is
nobler
born
and
mightier
far
in
warlike
deeds
but
thou
art
wise
and
prudent
therefore
do
thou
speak
gentle
words
of
warning
to
him
and
show
him
what
is
best
to
do
he
will
hearken
to
thy
words
spoken
for
his
good
there
also
was
ajax
the
valiant
son
of
telamon
huge
in
body
and
slow
in
speech
but
next
to
achilles
the
bravest
of
all
the
host
and
the
other
ajax
clad
in
his
linen
corslet
and
master
of
forty
ships
from
locris
moved
also
among
the
mightiest
of
the
heroes
there
too
was
nestor
the
aged
king
of
pylos
rich
in
wisdom
and
experience
and
skilled
in
persuasive
speech
with
him
was
his
son
antilochus
the
quondam
suitor
of
fair
helen
a
warrior
worthy
of
such
a
sire
and
there
was
idomeneus
the
stalwart
chief
who
ruled
the
hundred
cities
of
crete
and
was
the
sworn
friend
of
menelaus
and
there
was
philoctetes
the
cunning
archer
carrying
the
great
bow
which
had
been
given
him
for
his
last
sad
act
of
friendship
to
his
master
heracles
and
there
was
diomede
of
the
loud
wearing
the
skin
of
a
great
fiery
lion
round
his
shoulders
and
marshalling
the
warriors
who
had
come
with
him
from
argos
and
tiryns
of
the
mighty
walls
and
there
too
among
so
many
others
of
far
greater
worth
was
nireus
of
syma
his
locks
as
neatly
curled
and
his
linen
as
spotlessly
white
as
when
in
youth
he
had
sued
for
helen
s
hand
in
the
court
of
old
tyndareus
now
when
the
day
had
come
for
the
fleet
to
sail
the
chiefs
stood
upon
the
shore
and
offered
solemn
sacrifices
to
poseidon
and
prayed
the
gods
to
prosper
them
in
their
undertaking
and
bring
them
safe
again
to
their
loved
homes
in
hellas
while
they
were
burning
the
choicest
bits
of
fat
and
flesh
behold
a
strange
thing
happened
from
a
crevice
in
the
rocks
a
shining
serpent
with
glittering
cold
eyes
and
forked
tongue
came
creeping
silently
into
the
sunlight
the
heroes
gazed
upon
it
with
wonder
in
their
faces
for
they
knew
that
it
was
sent
as
a
sign
to
them
not
far
away
stood
a
green
with
foliage
in
which
a
bird
had
built
her
nest
and
in
the
nest
were
nine
tiny
fledglings
tenderly
cared
for
by
the
mother
bird
straight
to
this
tree
the
serpent
crept
it
twined
around
the
trunk
and
stealthily
climbed
to
the
nest
it
seized
the
helpless
little
ones
in
its
fangs
and
devoured
them
then
it
darted
upon
the
distressed
mother
bird
and
destroyed
her
most
pitilessly
but
now
a
gleam
of
lightning
flashed
across
the
sky
and
a
peal
of
thunder
shook
the
earth
and
sea
when
the
astonished
chiefs
looked
up
again
behold
the
serpent
had
been
turned
into
stone
call
calchas
the
seer
and
let
him
tell
us
what
this
portends
they
cried
then
calchas
his
long
hair
streaming
in
the
wind
his
wild
eyes
rolling
in
awe
his
gaunt
arms
waving
to
and
fro
above
his
head
came
and
looked
upon
the
wonder
ye
men
of
hellas
he
cried
i
will
tell
you
what
this
portends
as
there
were
nine
birds
in
the
nest
ye
shall
war
nine
years
against
troy
and
shall
not
prevail
but
even
as
the
serpent
destroyed
the
mother
bird
so
in
the
tenth
year
shall
the
city
and
its
walls
fall
into
your
hands
xx
at
aulis
a
pleasant
wind
from
the
west
sprang
up
and
drove
the
great
fleet
out
into
the
sea
not
a
single
one
of
the
thousand
ships
was
lost
or
left
behind
and
after
a
quick
and
happy
voyage
they
came
in
sight
of
a
fruitful
land
and
a
great
city
with
high
towers
and
pleasant
dwellings
the
gods
have
favored
us
even
beyond
what
we
asked
cried
the
hellenes
achilles
and
his
myrmidons
landed
first
and
without
waiting
for
the
other
ships
to
come
up
they
rushed
across
the
plain
and
began
an
assault
upon
the
town
like
a
swarm
of
locusts
lighting
down
upon
a
field
of
grain
and
consuming
every
thing
before
them
so
came
the
destroying
hellenes
the
gates
were
broken
down
the
astonished
people
fled
in
dismay
and
sought
safety
among
the
hills
and
in
the
forest
on
the
other
side
of
the
town
not
until
many
houses
had
been
burned
and
many
people
slain
did
odysseus
and
menelaus
whose
ships
had
been
delayed
reach
the
place
men
of
hellas
they
cried
hastening
into
the
midst
of
the
carnage
what
is
this
you
are
doing
this
is
not
troy
it
is
the
peaceful
city
of
teuthrania
in
mysia
cease
your
slaughter
and
return
at
once
to
your
vessels
lest
the
wrath
of
the
gods
fall
upon
you
the
word
was
carried
from
mouth
to
mouth
and
the
hasty
heroes
crestfallen
and
ashamed
stopped
their
bloody
work
and
turned
their
faces
back
towards
the
shore
where
their
ships
lay
beached
none
too
soon
did
they
retreat
for
the
king
of
mysia
one
telephus
a
son
of
heracles
having
quickly
called
his
warriors
together
fell
upon
their
rear
and
slew
great
numbers
of
them
following
them
even
to
the
sloping
beach
as
the
last
ship
was
pushing
out
an
arrow
from
the
bow
of
king
telephus
struck
patroclus
wounding
him
sorely
then
achilles
poising
his
long
spear
threw
it
with
deadly
aim
among
the
mysians
it
struck
king
telephus
and
laid
him
senseless
though
not
slain
upon
the
sandy
plain
no
sooner
had
the
fleet
set
sail
again
upon
the
sea
than
poseidon
stirred
up
the
waves
in
anger
and
loosed
the
winds
upon
them
great
was
the
terror
and
great
indeed
was
the
destruction
some
of
the
ships
were
sunk
in
and
some
were
driven
upon
the
rocks
and
wrecked
but
the
greater
number
of
them
after
days
and
weeks
of
buffeting
with
the
waves
made
their
way
back
to
aulis
when
the
heroes
stood
again
on
the
shores
of
the
euripus
they
began
to
think
that
doubtless
there
was
some
truth
in
the
omen
of
the
snake
and
the
birds
and
the
most
hopeful
among
them
ceased
to
dream
of
taking
troy
in
a
day
while
waiting
for
stragglers
to
come
in
and
for
the
shattered
vessels
to
be
repaired
they
found
enough
to
do
to
keep
the
time
from
dragging
heavily
and
when
not
engaged
in
some
kind
of
labor
they
amused
themselves
with
various
games
and
great
sport
had
they
with
quoits
and
javelins
with
bows
and
arrows
and
in
wrestling
and
running
and
now
and
then
they
went
out
into
the
woods
of
eubœa
and
hunted
the
wild
deer
which
roamed
there
in
abundance
one
day
it
chanced
that
agamemnon
while
hunting
started
a
fine
stag
and
gave
it
a
long
chase
among
the
hills
and
through
the
wooded
dells
until
it
sought
safety
in
a
grove
sacred
to
artemis
the
huntress
queen
the
proud
king
knew
that
this
was
a
holy
place
where
beasts
and
birds
might
rest
secure
from
harm
yet
he
cared
naught
for
what
artemis
had
ordained
and
with
his
swift
arrows
he
slew
the
panting
deer
then
was
the
huntress
queen
moved
with
anger
and
she
declared
that
the
ships
of
the
hellenes
should
not
sail
from
aulis
until
the
king
had
atoned
for
his
crime
and
a
great
calm
rested
upon
the
sea
and
not
a
breath
of
air
stirred
the
sails
at
the
of
the
ships
day
after
day
and
week
after
week
went
by
and
not
a
speck
of
cloud
was
seen
in
the
sky
above
and
not
a
ripple
on
the
glassy
face
of
the
deep
all
the
ships
had
been
put
in
order
new
vessels
had
been
built
the
warriors
had
burnished
their
armor
and
overhauled
their
arms
a
thousand
times
and
yet
no
breeze
arose
to
waft
them
across
the
sea
and
they
began
to
murmur
and
to
talk
bitterly
against
agamemnon
and
the
chiefs
in
the
mean
while
a
small
vessel
driven
by
rowers
came
up
the
euripus
and
stopped
among
the
ships
at
aulis
on
board
of
it
was
king
telephus
of
mysia
sorely
suffering
from
the
wound
which
achilles
had
given
him
on
the
teuthranian
beach
he
had
come
to
seek
the
hero
who
had
wounded
him
for
an
oracle
had
told
him
that
he
only
could
heal
the
grievous
hurt
achilles
carried
the
sufferer
to
his
tent
and
skilfully
dressed
the
wound
and
bound
it
up
with
healing
herbs
for
in
his
boyhood
he
had
learned
from
wise
old
cheiron
how
to
treat
such
ailments
and
now
that
knowledge
was
of
great
use
to
him
and
soon
the
king
was
whole
and
strong
again
and
he
vowed
that
he
would
not
leave
achilles
but
would
stay
with
the
hellenes
and
pilot
them
across
the
sea
to
troy
yet
the
wrath
of
artemis
continued
and
not
the
slightest
breeze
arose
to
cool
the
air
or
fill
the
waiting
sails
of
the
ships
at
last
agamemnon
sent
for
calchas
the
soothsayer
and
asked
him
in
secret
how
the
anger
of
the
huntress
queen
might
be
assuaged
and
the
soothsayer
with
tears
and
lamentations
answered
that
in
no
wise
could
it
be
done
save
by
the
sacrifice
to
artemis
of
his
maiden
daughter
iphigenia
then
the
king
cried
aloud
in
his
grief
and
declared
that
though
troy
might
stand
forever
he
would
not
do
that
thing
and
he
bade
a
herald
go
through
the
camp
and
among
the
ships
and
bid
every
man
depart
as
he
chose
to
his
own
country
but
before
the
herald
had
gone
from
his
tent
behold
his
brother
menelaus
the
wronged
husband
of
fair
helen
stood
before
him
with
downcast
eyes
and
saddest
of
hearts
after
ten
years
of
labor
and
hope
said
he
to
agamemnon
wouldst
thou
give
up
this
enterprise
and
lose
all
then
odysseus
came
also
into
the
tent
and
added
his
persuasions
to
those
of
menelaus
and
the
king
hearkened
to
him
for
no
man
was
more
crafty
in
counsel
and
the
three
recalled
the
herald
and
formed
a
plan
whereby
they
might
please
artemis
by
doing
as
she
desired
and
agamemnon
in
his
weakness
wrote
a
letter
to
clytemnestra
his
queen
telling
her
to
bring
the
maiden
iphigenia
to
aulis
there
to
be
wedded
to
king
achilles
not
in
added
he
the
godlike
hero
will
not
sail
with
us
unless
my
daughter
be
given
to
him
in
and
when
he
had
written
the
letter
he
sealed
it
and
sent
it
by
a
swift
messenger
to
clytemnestra
at
mycenæ
illustration
odysseus
and
menelaus
persuading
agamemnon
to
sacrifice
iphigenia
nevertheless
the
king
s
heart
was
full
of
sorrow
and
when
he
was
alone
he
planned
how
he
might
yet
save
his
daughter
night
came
but
he
could
not
sleep
he
walked
the
floor
of
his
tent
he
wept
and
lamented
like
one
bereft
of
reason
at
length
he
sat
down
and
wrote
another
letter
of
leda
send
not
thy
child
to
aulis
for
i
will
give
her
in
marriage
at
another
then
he
called
another
messenger
an
old
and
trusted
servant
of
the
household
and
put
this
letter
into
his
hands
take
this
with
all
haste
to
my
queen
who
perchance
is
even
now
on
her
way
to
aulis
stop
not
by
any
cool
spring
in
the
groves
and
let
not
thine
eyes
close
for
sleep
and
see
that
the
chariot
bearing
the
queen
and
iphigenia
pass
thee
not
unnoticed
the
messenger
took
the
letter
and
hasted
away
but
hardly
had
he
passed
the
line
of
the
tents
when
menelaus
saw
him
and
took
the
letter
from
him
and
when
he
had
read
it
he
went
before
his
brother
and
reproached
him
with
bitter
words
before
you
were
chosen
captain
of
the
host
said
he
you
were
kind
and
gentle
and
the
friend
of
every
man
there
was
nothing
that
you
would
not
do
to
aid
your
fellows
now
you
are
puffed
up
with
pride
and
vain
conceit
and
care
nothing
even
for
those
who
are
your
equals
in
power
yet
for
all
you
are
not
rid
of
your
cowardice
and
when
you
saw
that
your
leadership
was
likely
to
be
taken
away
from
you
unless
you
obeyed
the
commands
of
artemis
you
agreed
to
do
this
thing
now
you
are
trying
to
break
your
word
sending
secretly
to
your
wife
and
bidding
her
not
to
bring
her
daughter
to
aulis
then
agamemnon
answered
why
should
i
destroy
my
daughter
in
order
to
win
back
thy
wife
let
the
suitors
who
swore
an
oath
to
king
tyndareus
go
with
thee
in
what
way
am
i
bound
to
serve
thee
do
as
you
will
said
menelaus
going
away
in
wrath
soon
after
this
there
came
a
herald
to
the
king
saying
behold
your
daughter
iphigenia
has
come
as
you
directed
and
with
her
mother
and
her
little
brother
orestes
she
rests
by
the
spring
close
to
the
outer
line
of
tents
and
the
warriors
have
gathered
around
them
and
are
praising
her
loveliness
and
asking
many
questions
and
some
say
the
king
is
sick
to
see
his
daughter
whom
he
loves
so
deeply
and
he
has
made
up
some
excuse
to
bring
her
to
the
but
i
know
why
you
have
brought
her
here
for
i
have
been
told
about
the
wedding
and
the
noble
groom
who
is
to
lead
her
in
marriage
and
we
will
rejoice
and
be
glad
because
this
is
a
happy
day
for
the
maiden
then
the
king
was
sorely
distressed
and
knew
not
what
to
do
sad
sad
indeed
said
he
is
the
wedding
to
which
the
maiden
cometh
for
the
name
of
the
bridegroom
is
death
at
the
same
time
menelaus
came
back
sorrowful
and
repentant
you
were
right
my
brother
said
he
what
indeed
has
iphigenia
to
do
with
helen
and
why
should
the
maiden
die
for
me
send
the
hellenes
to
their
homes
and
let
not
this
great
wrong
be
done
but
how
can
i
do
that
now
asked
agamemnon
the
warriors
urged
on
by
odysseus
and
calchas
will
force
me
to
do
the
deed
or
if
i
flee
to
mycenæ
they
will
follow
me
and
slay
me
and
destroy
my
city
oh
woe
am
i
that
such
a
day
should
ever
dawn
upon
my
sight
even
while
they
spoke
together
the
queen
s
chariot
drove
up
to
the
tent
door
and
the
queen
and
iphigenia
and
the
little
orestes
alighted
quickly
and
merrily
greeted
the
king
it
is
well
that
you
have
sent
for
me
my
father
said
iphigenia
caressing
him
it
may
be
well
and
yet
it
may
not
said
agamemnon
i
am
exceeding
glad
to
see
thee
alive
and
happy
if
you
are
glad
why
then
do
you
weep
i
am
sad
because
thou
wilt
be
so
long
time
away
from
me
are
you
going
on
a
very
long
voyage
father
a
long
voyage
and
a
sad
one
my
child
and
thou
also
hast
a
journey
to
make
must
i
make
it
alone
or
will
my
mother
go
with
me
thou
must
make
it
alone
neither
father
nor
mother
nor
any
friend
can
go
with
thee
my
child
but
when
shall
it
be
i
pray
that
you
will
hasten
this
matter
with
troy
and
return
home
ere
then
it
may
be
so
but
i
must
offer
a
sacrifice
to
the
gods
before
we
sail
from
aulis
that
is
well
and
may
i
be
present
yes
and
thou
shalt
be
very
close
to
the
altar
shall
i
lead
in
the
dances
father
then
the
king
could
say
no
more
for
reason
of
the
great
sorrow
within
him
and
he
kissed
the
maiden
and
sent
her
into
the
tent
a
little
while
afterward
the
queen
came
and
spoke
to
him
and
asked
him
about
the
man
to
whom
their
daughter
was
to
be
wedded
and
agamemnon
still
dissembling
told
her
that
the
hero
s
name
was
achilles
and
that
he
was
the
son
of
old
peleus
and
the
thetis
and
when
and
where
is
the
marriage
to
be
asked
the
queen
on
the
first
lucky
day
in
the
present
moon
and
here
in
our
camp
at
aulis
answered
agamemnon
shall
i
stay
here
with
thee
until
then
nay
thou
must
go
back
to
mycenæ
without
delay
but
may
i
not
come
again
if
i
am
not
here
who
will
hold
up
the
torch
for
the
bride
i
will
attend
to
all
such
matters
answered
agamemnon
but
clytemnestra
was
not
well
pleased
neither
could
the
king
persuade
her
at
all
that
she
should
return
to
mycenæ
while
yet
they
were
talking
achilles
himself
came
to
the
tent
door
and
said
aloud
to
the
servant
who
kept
it
tell
thy
master
that
achilles
the
son
of
peleus
would
be
pleased
to
see
him
when
clytemnestra
overheard
these
words
she
hastened
to
the
door
and
offered
the
hero
her
hand
but
he
was
ashamed
and
drew
back
for
it
was
deemed
an
unseemly
thing
for
men
to
speak
thus
with
women
then
clytemnestra
said
why
indeed
should
you
who
are
about
to
marry
my
daughter
be
ashamed
to
give
me
your
hand
achilles
was
struck
with
wonder
and
asked
her
what
she
meant
and
when
she
had
explained
the
matter
he
said
truly
i
have
never
been
a
suitor
for
thy
daughter
neither
has
agamemnon
or
menelaus
spoken
a
word
to
me
regarding
her
and
now
the
queen
was
astonished
in
her
turn
and
cried
out
with
shame
that
she
had
been
so
cruelly
deceived
then
the
keeper
of
the
door
who
was
the
same
that
had
been
sent
with
the
letter
came
forward
and
told
the
truth
regarding
the
whole
matter
and
clytemnestra
cried
to
achilles
o
son
of
the
thetis
help
me
and
help
my
daughter
iphigenia
in
this
time
of
sorest
need
for
we
have
no
friend
in
all
this
host
and
none
in
whom
we
can
confide
but
thee
achilles
answered
long
time
ago
i
was
a
pupil
of
old
cheiron
the
most
righteous
of
men
and
from
him
i
learned
to
be
honest
and
true
if
agamemnon
rule
according
to
right
then
i
will
obey
him
but
not
otherwise
and
now
since
thy
daughter
was
brought
to
this
place
under
pretence
of
giving
her
to
me
as
my
bride
i
will
see
that
she
shall
not
be
slain
neither
shall
any
one
dare
take
her
from
me
on
the
following
day
while
agamemnon
sat
in
his
tent
the
maiden
came
before
him
carrying
the
babe
orestes
in
her
arms
and
she
cast
herself
upon
her
knees
at
his
feet
and
caressing
his
hands
she
thus
besought
him
would
dear
father
that
i
had
the
voice
of
orpheus
to
whom
even
the
rocks
did
listen
then
i
would
persuade
thee
o
father
i
am
thy
child
i
was
the
first
to
call
thee
father
and
the
first
to
whom
thou
saidst
my
the
father
turned
his
face
away
and
wept
he
could
not
speak
for
sadness
then
the
maiden
went
on
o
father
hear
me
thou
to
whom
my
voice
was
once
so
sweet
that
thou
wouldst
waken
me
to
hear
my
prattle
amid
the
songs
of
birds
when
it
was
meaningless
as
theirs
and
when
i
was
older
grown
then
thou
wouldst
say
to
me
some
day
my
birdling
thou
shalt
have
a
nest
of
thy
own
a
home
of
which
thou
shalt
be
the
and
i
did
answer
yes
dear
father
and
when
thou
art
old
i
will
care
for
thee
and
pay
thee
with
all
my
heart
for
the
kindness
thou
dost
show
but
now
thou
hast
forgotten
it
all
and
art
ready
to
slay
my
young
life
a
deep
groan
burst
from
the
lips
of
the
mighty
king
but
he
spoke
not
a
word
then
after
a
silence
broken
only
by
the
deep
breathings
of
father
and
child
iphigenia
spoke
again
my
father
can
there
be
any
prayer
more
pure
and
more
persuasive
than
that
of
a
maiden
for
her
father
s
welfare
and
when
the
cruel
knife
shall
strike
me
down
thou
wilt
have
one
daughter
less
to
pray
for
thee
a
shudder
shook
the
frame
of
agamemnon
but
he
answered
not
a
word
at
that
moment
achilles
entered
he
had
come
in
haste
from
the
tents
beside
the
shore
and
he
spoke
in
hurried
anxious
accents
behold
said
he
a
great
tumult
has
arisen
in
the
camp
for
calchas
has
given
out
among
the
men
that
you
refuse
to
do
what
artemis
has
bidden
and
that
hence
these
delays
and
troubles
have
arisen
and
the
rude
soldiers
are
crying
out
against
you
and
declaring
that
the
maiden
must
die
when
i
would
have
stayed
their
anger
they
took
up
stones
to
stone
me
my
own
myrmidons
among
the
rest
and
now
they
are
making
ready
to
move
upon
your
tent
threatening
to
sacrifice
you
also
with
your
daughter
but
i
will
fight
for
you
to
the
utmost
and
the
maiden
shall
not
die
as
he
was
speaking
calchas
entered
and
grasping
the
wrist
of
the
pleading
maiden
lifted
her
to
her
feet
she
looked
up
and
saw
his
stony
face
and
hard
cold
eyes
and
turning
again
to
agamemnon
she
said
o
father
the
ships
shall
sail
for
i
will
die
for
thee
then
achilles
said
to
her
fair
maiden
thou
art
by
far
the
noblest
and
most
lovely
of
thy
sex
fain
would
i
save
thee
from
this
fate
even
though
every
man
in
hellas
be
against
me
fly
with
me
quickly
to
my
galley
and
i
will
carry
thee
safely
away
from
this
accursed
place
not
so
answered
iphigenia
i
will
give
up
my
life
for
my
father
and
this
land
of
the
hellenes
and
no
man
shall
suffer
for
me
and
the
pitiless
priest
led
her
through
the
throng
of
rude
soldiers
to
the
grove
of
artemis
wherein
an
altar
had
been
built
but
achilles
and
agamemnon
covered
their
faces
with
their
mantles
and
staid
inside
the
tent
then
talthybius
the
herald
stood
up
and
bade
the
warriors
keep
silence
and
calchas
put
a
garland
of
flowers
about
the
victim
s
head
let
no
man
touch
me
said
the
maiden
for
i
offer
my
neck
to
the
sword
with
right
good
will
that
so
my
father
may
live
and
prosper
in
silence
and
great
awe
the
warriors
stood
around
while
calchas
drew
a
sharp
knife
from
its
scabbard
but
lo
as
he
struck
the
maiden
was
not
there
and
in
her
stead
a
noble
deer
lay
dying
on
the
altar
then
the
old
soothsayer
cried
out
in
triumphant
tones
see
now
ye
men
of
hellas
how
the
gods
have
provided
for
you
a
sacrifice
and
saved
the
innocent
daughter
of
the
king
and
all
the
people
shouted
with
joy
and
in
that
hour
a
strong
breeze
came
down
the
euripus
and
filled
the
idle
sails
of
the
waiting
ships
to
troy
to
troy
cried
the
hellenes
and
every
man
hastened
aboard
his
vessel
how
it
was
that
fair
iphigenia
escaped
the
knife
by
whom
she
was
saved
or
whither
she
went
no
one
knew
some
say
that
artemis
carried
her
away
to
the
land
of
the
taurians
where
she
had
a
temple
and
an
altar
and
that
long
years
afterward
her
brother
orestes
found
her
there
and
bore
her
back
to
her
girlhood
s
home
even
to
mycenæ
but
whether
this
be
true
or
not
i
know
that
there
have
been
maidens
as
noble
as
loving
as
innocent
as
she
who
have
given
up
their
lives
in
order
to
make
this
world
a
purer
and
happier
place
in
which
to
live
and
these
are
not
dead
but
live
in
the
grateful
memories
of
those
whom
they
loved
and
saved
long
siege
the
great
fleet
sailed
once
more
across
the
sea
piloted
now
by
telephus
the
king
of
mysia
and
the
ships
of
achilles
and
those
of
philoctetes
of
melibœa
led
all
the
rest
when
they
had
put
a
little
more
than
half
the
distance
behind
them
they
came
to
the
isle
of
chryse
where
were
a
fair
temple
and
altars
built
in
honor
of
athené
here
many
of
the
heroes
landed
and
while
some
were
busied
in
refilling
the
from
the
springs
of
fresh
water
near
the
shore
others
went
up
to
the
temple
and
offered
gifts
and
heartfelt
thanks
to
pallas
athené
but
as
philoctetes
the
cunning
archer
stood
near
one
of
the
altars
a
came
out
of
the
rocks
and
bit
him
on
the
foot
terrible
indeed
was
the
wound
and
great
were
the
hero
s
sufferings
day
and
night
he
groaned
and
cried
aloud
by
reason
of
the
bitter
pain
and
there
was
no
physician
that
could
heal
him
of
the
grievous
hurt
in
a
few
days
a
noisome
stench
began
to
issue
from
the
wound
and
the
hero
s
complainings
waxed
so
loud
and
piteous
that
the
warriors
stopped
their
ears
so
that
they
might
not
hear
them
then
the
chiefs
took
counsel
as
to
what
it
were
best
to
do
with
him
and
although
some
advised
that
he
be
cast
into
the
sea
it
was
thought
best
to
follow
a
milder
course
and
leave
him
alone
on
the
isle
of
lemnos
hence
while
the
hero
slept
odysseus
and
his
men
carried
him
on
shore
and
they
laid
his
great
bow
even
the
bow
of
heracles
by
his
side
upon
the
sand
and
put
a
cask
of
water
and
a
basket
of
food
within
easy
reach
of
his
hand
then
they
sailed
away
and
left
him
alone
in
his
great
distress
and
sorrow
at
length
the
shores
of
ilios
were
reached
and
the
high
towers
of
troy
were
seen
then
the
sails
of
the
vessels
were
furled
and
laid
away
in
the
roomy
holds
the
masts
were
lowered
with
speed
and
the
oarsmen
seated
themselves
upon
the
benches
and
rowed
the
ships
forward
until
they
stood
in
one
line
stretching
more
than
a
league
along
the
shore
but
as
they
drew
nearer
the
the
heroes
saw
all
the
plain
before
them
covered
with
armed
men
and
horses
and
chariots
drawn
up
to
hinder
their
landing
and
they
paused
uncertain
what
to
do
for
calchas
the
soothsayer
had
declared
that
he
who
should
first
step
foot
upon
the
shores
of
ilios
should
meet
a
sudden
death
who
among
all
the
heroes
will
dare
be
the
first
to
die
for
hellas
was
the
anxious
question
heard
on
every
vessel
not
a
man
was
there
who
was
not
willing
and
ready
to
be
the
second
one
to
step
on
shore
but
who
would
be
the
first
the
trojan
host
now
began
to
shoot
their
arrows
toward
the
ships
and
to
taunt
the
hellenes
with
cowardice
yet
even
achilles
and
ajax
telamon
the
mightiest
of
the
heroes
fell
back
and
would
not
take
the
fearful
risk
of
beginning
the
fight
then
protesilaus
who
had
led
forty
black
ships
from
phylace
and
the
shore
of
antrona
seeing
that
some
one
must
die
for
the
cause
leaped
boldly
out
of
the
ship
upon
the
shelving
beach
at
once
a
hundred
arrows
whistled
through
the
air
and
glanced
from
his
sevenfold
shield
of
and
a
heavy
spear
thrown
by
hector
the
mightiest
of
the
trojans
pierced
his
fair
armor
and
laid
him
bleeding
and
dead
upon
the
sand
quickly
the
warriors
leaped
ashore
face
to
face
and
hand
to
hand
they
fought
with
the
trojan
host
and
led
by
achilles
and
by
diomede
of
the
loud
they
drove
their
foes
across
the
plain
and
even
through
the
city
gates
but
protesilaus
lay
dead
upon
the
beach
and
few
of
the
heroes
remembered
that
to
him
they
owed
their
victory
and
when
his
wife
fair
laodamia
heard
in
far
phylace
that
he
had
fallen
first
in
the
fight
she
dight
herself
in
mourning
and
went
to
pray
at
the
shrine
of
mighty
zeus
and
the
prayer
which
she
offered
was
that
she
might
see
her
husband
once
again
and
holding
his
hand
might
talk
with
him
if
it
were
only
for
the
space
of
three
hours
then
hermes
led
the
hero
back
to
the
upper
world
and
he
sat
in
his
bridal
chamber
and
spoke
sweet
words
of
comfort
to
laodamia
but
when
the
short
hours
were
past
and
the
messenger
came
to
lead
protesilaus
back
to
the
land
of
shades
his
wife
prayed
that
she
might
return
with
him
and
men
say
that
this
prayer
also
was
heard
and
that
arm
in
arm
the
two
went
forth
together
to
their
shadowy
home
in
hades
time
would
fail
me
to
tell
you
how
the
greeks
encamped
upon
the
plain
of
troy
and
how
for
more
than
nine
long
years
they
laid
siege
to
that
great
city
neither
can
i
speak
of
the
ruinous
wrath
of
achilles
which
brought
so
much
woe
upon
the
hellenes
for
of
that
you
will
read
in
the
oldest
and
grandest
poem
that
the
world
has
ever
known
the
iliad
of
homer
and
there
also
you
will
read
of
the
death
of
patroclus
and
of
the
vengeance
which
achilles
wrought
even
by
the
slaying
of
godlike
hector
and
of
the
mighty
deeds
of
diomede
and
of
ajax
and
of
agamemnon
on
the
plains
of
troy
and
of
the
shrewd
counsels
and
crafty
schemes
of
odysseus
who
though
in
strength
surpassing
other
men
learned
to
trust
rather
to
his
skill
in
words
than
to
his
mastery
of
arms
the
time
at
length
drew
near
when
that
which
had
been
spoken
concerning
the
doom
of
achilles
was
to
be
fulfilled
for
when
he
saw
that
he
more
than
all
the
hellenes
was
held
in
dread
by
the
trojans
his
heart
was
puffed
up
with
unseemly
pride
and
he
boasted
of
his
deeds
and
spoke
of
himself
as
greater
even
than
phœbus
apollo
then
the
was
greatly
angered
and
no
longer
covered
him
with
his
great
shield
of
protection
but
left
him
to
his
doom
hence
on
a
day
when
he
stood
before
the
scæan
gate
and
taunted
the
trojans
on
the
walls
a
mighty
spear
smote
him
and
pierced
his
heart
some
say
that
the
weapon
was
thrown
by
paris
the
perfidious
one
who
had
caused
this
bloody
war
and
others
say
that
apollo
in
his
wrath
launched
the
fatal
bolt
the
body
of
achilles
incased
in
his
glorious
armor
lay
all
day
long
in
the
dust
while
hellenes
and
trojans
fought
around
it
and
neither
could
gain
the
mastery
or
carry
away
the
ghastly
prize
at
length
a
great
storm
burst
upon
the
combatants
the
thunder
rolled
the
lightning
flashed
the
rain
and
hail
fell
in
blinding
torrents
and
the
trojans
withdrew
behind
their
walls
then
the
hellenes
lifted
the
body
of
achilles
and
carried
it
to
their
ships
and
stripping
it
of
his
matchless
armor
they
laid
it
on
a
couch
and
standing
around
it
they
bewailed
his
untimely
death
and
his
mother
thetis
came
across
the
waves
with
all
the
in
her
train
and
while
she
wept
over
the
body
of
her
child
the
nymphs
arrayed
it
in
shining
robes
which
they
themselves
had
woven
in
their
coral
caves
then
after
many
days
and
nights
of
bitter
lamentation
the
hellenes
built
a
great
funeral
pile
upon
the
beach
and
they
laid
the
hero
thereon
and
set
fire
to
it
and
the
flames
leaped
high
over
the
sea
and
achilles
was
no
more
then
thetis
took
the
hero
s
glorious
armor
and
set
it
up
as
a
prize
to
that
one
who
should
excel
in
feats
of
strength
and
skill
in
a
grand
trial
to
be
made
beside
the
ships
only
two
of
all
the
host
stood
up
for
the
trial
ajax
telamon
and
odysseus
for
no
other
man
dared
contend
with
either
of
these
mighty
indeed
was
the
contest
but
in
the
end
odysseus
prevailed
and
the
matchless
armor
was
awarded
him
then
when
ajax
knew
that
he
had
been
beaten
in
the
suit
and
beaten
not
more
by
honest
strength
and
skill
than
by
crafty
guile
he
fell
prone
upon
the
earth
and
his
great
mind
lost
its
balance
and
when
he
arose
to
his
feet
he
knew
no
longer
his
friends
and
comrades
nor
did
he
remember
any
thing
but
like
a
roaring
wild
beast
he
rushed
from
the
tents
into
the
fields
and
pasture
lands
and
seeing
a
flock
of
sheep
browsing
among
the
herbage
he
fell
upon
them
with
his
sword
and
slaughtered
great
numbers
of
them
fancying
that
they
were
foemen
seeking
his
life
nor
did
any
man
dare
say
any
thing
to
him
or
try
in
any
way
to
check
him
or
turn
him
aside
from
his
mad
freaks
when
he
grew
tired
at
length
of
slaughtering
the
helpless
beasts
he
went
down
into
a
green
dell
and
fell
upon
his
own
sword
a
great
stream
of
blood
gushed
from
the
wound
and
dyed
the
earth
and
from
it
sprang
a
purple
flower
bearing
upon
its
edges
both
the
initials
of
his
name
and
a
sign
of
woe
the
letters
greek
ai
then
odysseus
bewailed
his
comrade
s
unhappy
death
would
that
i
had
never
prevailed
and
won
that
prize
he
cried
so
goodly
a
head
hath
the
earth
closed
over
for
the
sake
of
these
arms
even
that
of
ajax
who
in
beauty
and
in
feats
of
war
was
of
a
mould
far
above
all
other
men
save
only
peerless
achilles
what
a
tower
of
strength
wert
thou
long
indeed
shall
it
be
ere
hellas
shall
see
another
like
thee
see
note
at
the
end
of
this
volume
after
this
the
hellenes
began
to
despair
for
many
of
their
noblest
heroes
had
perished
who
now
should
lead
them
on
to
victory
surely
not
patroclus
nor
achilles
nor
ajax
bitter
murmurings
were
heard
among
the
ships
and
the
men
declared
that
ere
another
moon
should
pass
they
would
embark
and
sail
back
to
their
loved
homes
nor
ask
the
leave
of
agamemnon
at
the
foot
of
mount
ida
there
stood
a
temple
of
apollo
built
by
the
trojans
while
yet
sweet
peace
was
smiling
on
the
land
to
that
temple
helenus
the
wise
soothsayer
one
of
priam
s
sons
was
wont
to
go
stealing
out
from
the
city
in
the
darkness
of
midnight
and
returning
ere
the
gray
dawn
of
morning
appeared
he
went
there
that
he
might
learn
from
apollo
the
secrets
of
the
future
and
he
fondly
hoped
that
his
going
was
unknown
to
the
foes
of
troy
but
shrewd
odysseus
found
him
out
and
one
night
with
a
band
of
men
he
lay
in
wait
for
the
and
took
him
captive
this
is
a
rich
treasure
that
we
have
taken
said
odysseus
and
it
shall
repay
us
for
all
our
losses
helenus
was
straightway
taken
to
the
camp
around
him
gathered
the
heroes
agamemnon
nestor
menelaus
and
all
the
rest
demanding
that
he
should
uncover
the
secrets
of
the
future
when
and
how
shall
the
hellenes
overcome
your
city
of
troy
said
odysseus
tell
us
this
and
tell
us
truly
or
death
in
its
fearfullest
form
shall
come
upon
thee
swiftly
then
the
trembling
seer
revealed
to
his
enemies
that
which
he
had
learned
at
apollo
s
shrine
he
told
them
that
within
the
present
year
the
hellenes
would
certainly
prevail
if
only
they
did
three
things
without
which
troy
could
never
be
taken
first
the
palladion
the
monster
image
of
athené
must
be
removed
from
the
temple
in
the
city
and
set
up
in
the
camp
by
the
seashore
second
young
pyrrhus
the
son
of
achilles
must
be
brought
from
his
of
scyros
to
take
the
place
of
his
father
at
the
head
of
the
myrmidon
host
and
third
philoctetes
who
had
been
so
deeply
wronged
by
the
chiefs
and
left
to
perish
on
the
desert
shores
of
lemnos
must
be
found
and
brought
to
troy
and
healed
of
his
grievous
wound
these
are
great
tasks
and
heavy
said
odysseus
nevertheless
i
will
undertake
to
see
them
performed
then
he
ordered
a
swift
ship
to
be
made
ready
and
with
old
phoinix
as
companion
and
a
score
of
trusted
he
went
on
board
and
sailed
at
once
for
scyros
the
quondam
home
of
great
achilles
ten
days
afterward
he
returned
bringing
with
him
the
lad
pyrrhus
so
like
his
glorious
father
in
face
and
figure
that
the
myrmidons
hailed
him
at
once
as
their
chief
and
king
thus
have
i
done
one
of
the
three
tasks
said
odysseus
i
shall
perform
the
other
two
mayhap
as
easily
and
then
the
high
walls
of
troy
shall
fall
before
us
three
days
later
the
swift
ship
of
odysseus
again
put
to
sea
and
young
pyrrhus
was
the
hero
s
comrade
it
was
but
a
short
voyage
to
lemnos
and
when
they
reached
that
island
they
moored
their
vessel
in
the
sheltering
cove
close
by
the
spot
where
nine
years
before
the
suffering
philoctetes
had
been
left
odysseus
concealed
himself
and
sent
the
young
prince
on
shore
with
some
of
the
warriors
who
had
come
with
them
for
he
rightly
guessed
that
philoctetes
had
not
forgotten
the
wrong
which
he
had
suffered
at
his
hands
pyrrhus
found
the
hero
living
alone
in
a
wretched
cave
with
no
friend
but
the
mighty
bow
of
heracles
and
suffering
still
great
torments
from
the
horrid
wound
in
his
foot
yet
the
prince
could
not
prevail
upon
him
to
sail
to
troy
for
he
said
that
he
would
rather
endure
the
distress
the
hunger
and
the
loneliness
which
were
his
in
lemnos
than
meet
again
those
false
friends
who
had
left
him
there
to
die
then
odysseus
came
forth
from
his
with
a
company
of
men
to
seize
the
hero
and
carry
him
by
force
on
board
the
vessel
but
this
the
young
prince
would
not
permit
and
philoctetes
when
he
saw
them
fled
into
the
innermost
parts
of
his
cave
and
would
not
come
forth
when
odysseus
found
that
neither
threats
nor
entreaties
would
prevail
upon
the
hero
he
went
back
to
his
ship
and
made
ready
to
return
to
troy
then
it
was
that
a
vision
appeared
to
philoctetes
a
vision
of
nighty
heracles
clothed
in
bright
raiment
and
a
great
glory
shining
in
his
face
go
thou
to
the
land
of
ilios
said
the
vision
there
thou
shalt
first
be
healed
of
thy
grievous
sickness
and
afterwards
thou
shalt
do
great
deeds
and
shalt
aid
in
taking
the
city
and
the
first
prize
of
valor
shall
be
awarded
to
thee
among
all
the
heroes
for
it
is
the
will
of
the
immortals
that
troy
shall
be
taken
and
that
my
bow
shall
mightily
aid
in
its
overthrow
then
philoctetes
went
forth
from
his
and
was
taken
on
board
the
vessel
and
as
the
sails
were
spread
and
the
breezes
wafted
them
towards
the
trojan
shore
he
bade
a
tearful
farewell
to
lemnos
where
he
had
spent
so
many
years
of
loneliness
and
sorrow
farewell
to
thee
o
home
that
didst
befriend
me
when
others
failed
farewell
ye
nymphs
that
haunt
the
meadows
and
the
shore
or
dwell
beside
the
gushing
mountain
springs
farewell
o
cave
that
oft
hast
been
my
shelter
from
the
winter
s
frosty
winds
and
the
sweltering
rays
of
the
summer
s
sun
i
leave
you
now
and
thou
o
lemnos
i
may
never
more
behold
and
grant
ye
gods
that
favoring
winds
may
blow
and
carry
me
safely
wheresoe
er
the
fates
would
have
me
go
as
soon
as
the
heroes
reached
the
trojan
shore
and
the
ship
was
drawn
to
its
place
high
on
the
beach
philoctetes
was
carried
to
the
tents
and
given
in
charge
of
machaon
asclepius
noble
son
and
as
he
lay
upon
a
cot
in
the
tent
of
the
kind
physician
a
sweet
odor
like
that
of
blossoming
orchards
and
the
bloom
of
clover
filled
the
air
around
him
and
he
slept
and
men
said
that
the
spirit
of
asclepius
had
fanned
him
into
slumber
then
machaon
with
matchless
skill
cut
out
the
poisoned
flesh
from
his
foot
and
cleansed
it
and
bound
it
up
with
soft
linen
and
when
the
hero
awoke
the
pain
had
left
him
and
the
wound
from
which
he
had
suffered
such
untold
torments
began
at
once
to
heal
it
chanced
one
day
as
philoctetes
was
sitting
outside
of
his
tent
that
a
party
of
trojans
led
by
paris
made
a
sally
from
the
city
gates
and
came
scouring
across
the
plain
intent
on
doing
mischief
to
the
hellenes
as
the
daring
warriors
drew
near
the
tents
philoctetes
fitted
an
arrow
to
the
great
bow
of
heracles
and
took
aim
at
their
leader
the
deadly
dart
pierced
the
shoulder
of
paris
and
he
fell
headlong
from
his
chariot
and
there
he
would
have
met
his
death
had
not
his
comrades
quickly
rallied
and
carried
him
faint
with
pain
back
to
the
city
and
his
father
s
halls
terrible
were
the
tortures
which
the
hero
suffered
for
the
arrow
was
one
of
those
which
heracles
had
poisoned
by
dipping
in
the
blood
of
the
hydra
the
venom
sped
through
his
burning
veins
his
strength
failed
him
the
torments
of
a
thousand
deaths
seemed
to
be
upon
him
then
he
forgot
fair
helen
for
whose
sake
was
all
this
war
and
bloodshed
and
he
bethought
him
of
gentle
œnone
whom
in
the
innocent
days
of
youth
he
had
wooed
and
won
in
the
pleasant
dales
of
ida
and
he
cried
aloud
bring
to
me
œnone
her
whom
i
have
so
grievously
wronged
she
alone
can
heal
me
of
my
hurt
then
swift
messengers
were
sent
to
the
woody
slopes
of
ida
to
find
if
it
might
be
the
wife
come
quickly
and
save
thy
erring
but
repentant
husband
such
was
the
message
behold
he
suffers
from
a
grievous
wound
but
thou
art
skilled
in
the
healing
art
above
all
who
dwell
in
ilios
and
he
prays
that
forgiving
all
wrong
thou
wilt
hasten
to
help
him
when
œnone
heard
the
message
she
remembered
the
cruel
wrongs
which
she
had
endured
so
long
at
the
hands
of
faithless
paris
and
without
a
word
in
answer
she
turned
away
and
went
about
her
daily
tasks
in
her
humble
cottage
home
then
the
messengers
returned
to
troy
and
told
the
prince
that
œnone
would
not
come
to
help
him
and
paris
with
a
groan
of
pain
and
a
sigh
of
despair
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
and
died
then
œnone
too
late
repented
that
she
had
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
her
husband
s
last
request
and
in
haste
she
clad
herself
in
her
wedding
robes
and
came
to
the
sad
halls
of
the
prince
not
knowing
that
death
had
taken
him
fair
and
beautiful
as
in
the
days
of
her
youth
she
stood
before
his
lifeless
form
she
took
his
cold
hands
in
her
warm
palm
and
said
i
have
come
o
paris
waken
and
speak
to
me
dost
thou
not
remember
me
œnone
whom
thou
didst
woo
in
the
flowery
dells
of
ida
i
am
still
the
same
and
never
have
i
wronged
thee
speak
to
me
o
paris
then
she
knelt
beside
him
and
saw
the
gaping
wound
which
the
arrow
of
philoctetes
had
made
and
she
knew
that
life
had
fled
and
that
the
hero
never
more
would
waken
or
speak
to
her
and
the
gentle
heart
of
œnone
was
broken
with
the
anguish
which
came
upon
her
and
when
the
men
of
troy
laid
paris
upon
the
funeral
pile
and
the
smoke
and
flame
arose
towards
heaven
the
fair
perfidious
prince
was
not
alone
for
œnone
shared
his
blazing
couch
while
troy
was
in
mourning
for
the
unhappy
death
of
paris
odysseus
and
diomede
were
planning
the
means
by
which
to
obtain
the
sacred
image
of
athené
the
palladion
of
troy
in
the
guise
of
a
ragged
beggar
odysseus
found
his
way
into
the
city
and
to
the
door
of
the
temple
where
the
great
image
stood
ah
odysseus
i
know
thee
despite
thy
rags
was
whispered
into
his
ear
as
a
fair
hand
offered
him
a
pittance
he
looked
up
and
saw
the
peerless
helen
before
him
as
beautiful
as
when
a
score
of
years
before
the
princes
of
hellas
had
sued
for
her
hand
at
the
court
of
old
tyndareus
be
not
afraid
she
said
i
will
not
betray
you
and
then
she
told
him
how
unhappy
she
had
been
in
troy
and
how
she
longed
to
return
to
her
countrymen
and
to
her
husband
menelaus
and
she
promised
to
aid
him
in
whatever
way
she
could
to
carry
off
the
treasured
palladion
and
to
open
the
way
for
the
overthrow
of
troy
odysseus
shrewdest
of
men
talked
not
long
with
the
princess
but
soon
returned
to
the
camp
three
nights
later
he
and
diomede
made
their
way
by
stealth
into
the
city
and
carried
away
the
priceless
palladion
and
now
the
three
tasks
which
helenus
had
spoken
of
had
been
performed
what
more
remained
ere
the
doomed
city
should
be
overthrown
the
chiefs
must
needs
again
consult
with
shrewd
odysseus
and
the
plan
which
he
proposed
was
carried
out
a
wooden
horse
of
wondrous
size
was
made
and
in
it
the
doughtiest
heroes
of
the
host
with
young
pyrrhus
as
their
leader
hid
themselves
then
the
rest
of
the
hellenes
embarked
with
all
their
goods
aboard
their
ships
and
sailed
away
beyond
the
wooded
shores
of
tenedos
but
the
monster
horse
with
its
hidden
load
of
heroes
stood
alone
upon
the
beach
when
the
trojans
looking
from
their
high
towers
beheld
their
enemies
depart
they
were
filled
with
joy
and
opening
wide
their
gates
they
poured
out
of
the
city
and
crowded
across
the
plain
anxious
to
see
the
wonderful
horse
the
only
relic
which
their
foes
had
left
upon
their
shores
while
they
were
gazing
upon
it
and
hazarding
many
a
guess
at
its
purpose
and
use
a
prisoner
was
brought
before
the
chiefs
it
was
sinon
a
young
hellene
who
had
been
found
lurking
among
the
rocks
by
the
shore
trembling
with
pretended
fear
he
told
the
trojans
a
sad
false
story
of
wrongs
which
he
said
he
had
suffered
at
the
hands
of
odysseus
but
what
meaneth
this
monster
image
of
a
horse
tell
us
that
said
the
trojan
chiefs
then
sinon
told
them
how
the
hellenes
had
suffered
great
punishment
at
the
hands
of
athené
because
they
had
stolen
the
sacred
palladion
of
troy
and
how
it
was
on
this
account
that
they
had
at
last
given
up
the
siege
of
troy
and
had
sailed
away
for
their
homes
in
distant
hellas
and
he
told
them
too
of
the
words
of
calchas
the
soothsayer
that
they
should
leave
on
the
shores
of
ilios
an
image
which
should
serve
the
same
purpose
to
those
who
honored
it
as
the
sacred
palladion
had
served
within
the
walls
of
troy
and
that
if
the
trojans
should
revere
this
figure
and
set
it
up
within
their
walls
it
would
prove
a
tower
of
strength
to
them
insuring
eternal
greatness
to
troy
and
utter
destruction
to
hellas
need
i
tell
you
how
this
artful
story
deceived
the
trojans
and
how
with
shouts
of
triumph
they
dragged
the
great
image
into
the
city
need
i
tell
you
how
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
the
fleet
returned
from
tenedos
and
the
mighty
host
again
landed
upon
the
trojan
shore
or
how
the
heroes
concealed
within
the
wooden
horse
came
out
of
their
and
opened
the
gates
to
their
friends
outside
or
how
the
hellenes
fell
upon
the
astonished
trojans
awakened
so
suddenly
from
a
false
dream
of
peace
or
how
with
sword
and
torch
they
slew
and
burned
and
meted
out
the
doom
of
the
fated
city
it
was
thus
that
the
princes
of
hellas
performed
the
oath
which
they
had
sworn
years
and
years
before
in
the
halls
of
king
tyndareus
and
it
was
thus
that
the
wrongs
of
menelaus
were
avenged
fair
helen
was
given
back
to
her
husband
and
the
honor
of
hellas
was
freed
