the

christmas
eve
yet
it
was
very
cold
and
dark
over
the
quaint
old
town
of
bruges
hung
the
heavy
and
the
air
was
filled
with
which
fell
so
thick
and
fast
that
very
soon
the
ground
was
covered
with
a
white
mantle
quickly
hiding
the
of
the
few
who
were
still
out
buying
the
last
gifts
for
beautiful
christmas
trees
through
the
narrow
streets
rushed
the
wind
shrieking
round
the
comers
in

shrill
whistle
and
seeming
to
say
as

on
this

christmas
it
was
really
strange
what
curious
things
the
wind
whistled
that
night
yet
through
all
ran
the
refrain
of
the
holy
christmas
eve
near
the
great
belfry
of
bruges
was
a
stately
mansion
where
the
fires
burned
brightly
in
the
polished
grates
with
a
warm
rosy
glow
making
upon
the
wall
grotesque
shadows
of
a
little
boy
and
girl
who
were
joyous
with
expectant
happiness
it
was
early
and
the
lamps
were
not
yet
lighted
the
children
danced
up
and
down
the
warm
pleasant
room
where
they
were
to
remain
until
the
mother
called
them
the
dear
loving
mother
had
been
so
busy
in
the
great
parlor
doing
something
full
of
mystery
yet
the
children
were
quite
sure
it
was
a
delightful
mystery
that
would
bring
them
a
great
store
of
happiness
and
they
were
luxuriating
in
their
own
pleasant
imaginings
the
door
was
still
locked
but
the
time
was
fast
approaching
for
the
grand
opening
i
can
t
wait
i
can
t
wait
much
longer
said
the
boy
impatiently
what
a
lazy
old
thing
santa
claus
is
for
shame
brother
to
speak
so
of
the
good
santa
claus
who
brings
us
such
beautiful
gifts
i
will
watch
for
him
the
kind
old
santa
claus
to
come
from
the
gift
land
for
us
in
all
the
wind
and
snow
and
the
little
girl
ran
to
the
window
and
drew
aside
the
rich
heavy
curtain
but
santa
claus
always
comes
down
the
chimney
little
miss
wisdom
said
the
boy
joining
her
how
it
snows
i
m
so
glad
twill
be
such
fun
for
us
boys
tis
the
old
woman
up
in
the
clouds
picking
her
goose
for
christmas
dinner
said
the
little
girl
laughing
and
singing
old
woman
up
in
the
clouds
so
high
making
the
feathers
about
us
fly
picking
your
geese
for
christmas
pie
give
me
a
piece
of
it
by
and
by
just
then
the
mother
was
heard
calling
and
the
children
ran
into
the
great
parlor
all
ablaze
with
light
and
beauty
in
the
center
of
all
rose
the
beautiful
christmas
tree
luminous
with
shining
toys
and
candles
oh
it
was
delightful
to
the
little
ones
nothing
could
compare
with
the
christmas
tree
full
of
beautiful
presents
just
what
they
had
been
wanting
and
hoped
that
wonderful
old
diviner
santa
claus
would
think
of
and
of
the
whole
year
to
them
no
time
was
like
the
glorious
christmas
season
in
quite
another
part
of
the
town
very
poor
and
squalid
lived
the
lace
weavers
in
quaint
old
buildings
falling
to
ruins
they
were
huddled
together
many
wretched
homes
under
one
roof
yet
even
there
they
were
trying
to
celebrate
the
birth
of
the
blessed
christ
child
in
the
dingy
rooms
burned
cheap
tallow
candles
and
the
little
ones
with
their
poor
wee
gifts
were
as
happy
as
the
brother
and
sister
with
the
beautiful
christmas
tree
in
the
stately
mansion
one
room
only
a
very
small
one
up
in
an
attic
in
the
quarters
was
in
darkness
by
the
window
stood
a
little
sorrowful
girl
very
all
alone
watching
the
it
was
very
cold
and
her
clothes
were
thin
and
ragged
she
shivered
for
she
was
quite
chilled
through
she
was
an
orphan
the
father
had
died
oh
long
ago
one
whole
year
an
age
in
the
life
of
a
child
only
the
week
before
the
mother
was
driven
away
to
her
last
home
in
the
paupers
to
rest
in
the
plain
deal
coffin
till
beautiful
white
wings
should
waft
her
up
to
heaven
the
golden
it
was
very
sad
to
see
the
little
child
looking
after
the
paupers
cart
driven
so
roughly
over
the
frozen
ground
and
the
neighbors
had
pitied
her
and
though
they
were
poor
like
the
mother
they
had
given
her
food
with
their
sympathy
and
promised
to
help
her
on
with
the
trade
they
were
honest
folk
but
somehow
in
this
joyous
christmas
season
they
had
all
forgotten
her
and
far
up
in
the
dreary
of
the
old
she
looked
out
into
the
night
and
storm
alone
it
was
so
dark
in
the
room
that
she
could
not
bear
to
leave
the
window
though
the
wind
whistled
in
at
the
loose
casement
making
quite
a
clatter
and
causing
her
little
teeth
to
chatter
with
cold
she
was
very
hungry
she
had
eaten
the
last
crust
the
night
before
and
everybody
had
been
so
busy
it
was
not
strange
she
thought
that
they
had
forgotten
her
she
could
remember
the
last
christmas
they
were
all
together
how
busy
the
mother
was
making
the
christmas
pie
and
how
the
father
brought
home
a
wooden
doll
saying
tis
for
my
good
little
daughter
and
kissed
her
then
taking
her
on
his
shoulder
he
danced
all
about
the
room
and
how
the
dear
mother
laughed
she
was
so
happy
then
and
now
so
desolate
and
wretched
everybody
else
was
happy
she
heard
the
children
shouting
and
she
was
so
faint
and
hungry
just
then
a
man
in
an
coat
and
cap
came
along
and
lighted
the
street
lamp
opposite
the
window
that
made
it
more
cheerful
still
the
child
was
so
cold
and
hungry
she
could
bear
it
no
longer
i
will
go
out
she
thought
into
the
light
perhaps
i
shall
dare
to
go
in
somewhere
the
neighbors
have
been
so
kind
to
me
but
i
m
not
used
to
them
as
i
was
to
the
dear
mother
i
will
wish
them
a
merry
christmas
and
they
will
give
me
something
to
eat
then
perhaps
i
can
sleep
and
go
away
in
my
dreams
to
the
beautiful
land
where
it
is
warm
with
god
s
pleasant
taking
from
the
shelf
a
faded
shawl
and
torn
bonnet
which
had
been
the
mother
s
she
fastened
them
on
as
well
as
she
could
but
they
were
too
large
it
was
all
of
no
use
they
would
slip
off
again
as
she
opened
the
door
of
her
chamber
a
great
draught
of
wind
rushed
in
from
the
street
some
one
was
coming
in
at
the
common
staircase
she
heard
merry
voices
and
footsteps
on
the
stairs
she
drew
back
into
the
darkness
of
her
own
room
with
shrinking
timidity
very
strange
it
was
to
her
the
cheery
laughing
yet
she
had
been
as
once
but
it
seemed
a
great
while
ago
when
the
sound
of
voices
died
away
she
stole
softly
down
the
stairs
to
the
door
of
the
great
front
room
which
had
always
been
the
grand
place
to
her
of
all
the
neighbors
the
woman
in
this
best
room
had
been
most
kind
to
her
and
the
poor
mother
in
sickness
the
little
cold
fingers
gave
a
timid
knock
but
within
the
father
and
mother
were
talking
and
the
little
ones
laughing
so
loud
that
no
one
said
the
welcome
come
in
or
came
to
open
the
door
the
cold
winds
whistled
through
the
uncovered
halls
of
the
tenement
house
and
the
child
stood
waiting
with
chattering
teeth
and
feet
and
hands
so
benumbed
that
she
thought
it
would
be
better
out
in
the
street
there
she
could
run
and
warm
herself
it
was
snowing
fast
and
the
feathery
flakes
fell
all
over
the
worn
shawl
covering
its
faded
colors
with
soft
white
down
over
the
great
bonnet
that
would
fall
back
upon
her
neck
and
over
the
rich
curls
that
were
left
bare
to
the
storm
as
she
ran
on
the
streets
grew
lighter
and
on
each
side
of
the
way
were
gay
shops
with
great
windows
filled
with
a
thousand
beautiful
things
how
much
better
it
was
than
staying
in
the
dark
alone
and
she
thought
if
she
were
not
so
cold
and
hungry
she
could
have
quite
enjoyed
it
there
was
a
great
jolly
man
walking
on
before
her
humming
a
song
presently
he
stopped
to
look
in
at
a
shop
window
and
she
read
in
his
broad
pleasant
face
that
his
heart
was
kind
and
loving
so
without
stopping
to
dread
it
she
ran
up
to
him
saying
please
sir
i
wish
you
a
merry
ah
ha
little
one
he
said
kindly
you
ve
caught
a
christmas
gift
but
it
is
too
stormy
a
night
for
little
things
like
you
to
be
drawing
from
his
pocket
one
of
many
small
packages
he
said
my
babies
will
never
miss
this
now
run
home
like
a
good
child
no
doubt
the
mother
is
calling
you
then
he
hurried
on
and
the
child
with
trembling
fingers
untied
the
parcel
how
she
hoped
it
was
a
piece
of
bread
but
no
it
was
a
pretty
toy
lamb
with
a
fleece
as
white
as
the
snow
that
was
covering
her
she
was
so
much
disappointed
that
the
tears
ran
down
her
face
very
fast
and
in
the
storm
and
cold
this
was
uncomfortable
just
then
the
beautiful
chimes
sounded
from
the
great
belfry
of
bruges
this
christmas
eve
they
were
played
by
a
famous
musician
who
sat
in
the
chamber
below
the
belfry
and
struck
upon
an
immense
like
that
of
a
piano
these
keys
connect
with
hammers
that
strike
the
bells
so
that
in
all
the
world
there
are
no
chimes
like
those
of
the
belfry
of
bruges
there
the
grand
musician
sat
and
played
throwing
the
whole
harmony
of
his
soul
into
the
music
and
all
the
town
of
bruges
stopped
to
listen
and
clasping
each
other
s
hands
whispered
softly
how
beautiful
for
the
divine
music
thrilled
them
above
all
it
went
to
the
heart
of
the
little
hungry
child
out
alone
in
the
pitiless
night
and
storm
the
voices
of
the
matchless
chimes
led
her
and
she
hurried
on
to
the
great
belfry
clasping
the
pretty
white
lamb
closely
in
her
little
chilled
hand
somehow
she
did
not
feel
so
hungry
now
and
that
was
a
blessing
there
was
the
stately
mansion
all
ablaze
with
light
she
could
look
in
through
the
rich
crimson
curtains
of
the
grand
parlor
window
and
see
the
beautiful
christmas
tree
and
the
happy
children
dancing
around
it
it
was
very
near
the
belfry
and
she
sat
down
on
the
broad
steps
and
wrapping
her
shawl
about
her
listened
to
the
wonderful
chimes
still
the
snow
fell
heavily
covering
her
over
with
its
cold
white
mantle
but
she
did
not
move
the
voice
of
the
chimes
was
whispering
in
her
ear
such
beautiful
things
it
was
delightful
and
all
the
dread
shadows
that
filled
the
night
and
storm
faded
away
for
they
were
only
born
of
earth
yes
it
told
her
of
a
great
christmas
tree
up
in
heaven
the
golden
there
was
a
pure
white
robe
and
shining
wings
the
priceless
gift
of
the
father
s
love
these
were
all
marked
with
her
name
and
she
was
very
happy
she
was
no
longer
hungry
nor
cold
for
the
snow
mantle
was
thick
now
over
her
little
shrunken
form
only
the
tiny
pale
face
looked
out
from
the
white
covering
and
that
was
leaning
against
the
pillar
of
the
great
doorway
the
old
bonnet
had
fallen
off
and
she
tried
no
longer
to
confine
it
when
the
storm
was
over
and
the
moon
came
out
it
shone
upon
her
golden
brown
hair
making
it
luminous
with
beauty
how
smoothly
it
sailed
along
that
crescent
boat
of
the
sky
and
the
deep
blue
eyes
watching
it
saw
such
marvelous
sights
so
pleasant
that
a
sweet
peace
gathered
around
the
child
the
poor
little
heart
that
in
the
early
hours
of
the
blessed
christmas
eve
beat
with
the
quick
flutter
of
fearful
timidity
and
loneliness
was
at
rest
in
the
holy
calm
yes
there
was
the
dear
mother
in
the
golden
boat
so
peaceful
and
free
from
care
how
tenderly
her
dear
eyes
shone
and
how
beautiful
she
was
in
the
radiant
light
of
heaven
she
beckoned
with
her
hand
and
the
little
child
reached
eagerly
out
to
her
crying
it
is
the
mother
oh
mother
dear
i
am
coming
wait
mother
i
am
com
up
to
the
crescent
boat
on
to
heaven
the
golden
and
to
the
throne
of
the
loving
god
had
passed
the
spirit
of
the
little
child
just
then
a
bright
star
fell
down
from
the
fleecy
clouds
and
rested
upon
the
pure
forehead
leaning
so
heavily
against
the
great
pillar
of
the
stately
doorway
the
cadence
of
the
last
chime
was
dying
away
upon
the
still
night
air
it
was
twelve
o
clock
and
the
musician
went
home
the
great
belfry
was
left
silent
and
in
the
coming
of
the
holy
christmas
dawning
all
the
peaceful
town
of
bruges
slept
in
the
morning
the
servant
found
a
little
child
dead
upon
the
door
steps
of
the
grand
mansion
with
the
frost
glittering
like
a
crown
of
glory
in
her
golden
hair
it
was
said
she
was
a
poor
s
child
who
had
died
in
great
poverty
and
want
the
crowd
gathered
about
the
door
saying
it
is
sad
oh
very
sad
but
they
knew
nothing
of
what
the
music
of
the
bells
had
been
to
her
nothing
of
the
golden
boat
at
last
when
men
came
to
take
the
poor
little
thing
away
to
the
paupers
the
good
mother
of
the
house
said
no
do
not
take
her
away
i
entreat
then
she
folded
the
child
in
her
arms
kissing
her
pale
cheeks
and
golden
hair
saying
i
will
see
to
it
the
good
lord
led
her
to
my
door
and
though
it
is
late
i
will
do
all
there
is
left
me
she
shall
rest
in
the
pleasant
garden
under
the
dear
little
one
we
can
do
nothing
more
now
but
in
heaven
the
golden
the
loving
god
will
receive
her
a
most
precious
christmas
offering
golden
snow
the
were
falling
all
over
the
northern
gold
land
for
it
was
against
the
shore
the
angry
breakers
of
the
great
pacific
dashed
and
the
wind
whistled
like
a
trumpeter
a
warm
fire
burned
on
the
hearth
of
the
fisherman
s
hut
and
with
a
red
face
the
bent
over
it
preparing
the
supper
the
old
man
stood
by
the
window
looking
out
and
thinking
his
poor
thoughts
of
the
wind
and
the
tide
which
ended
always
with
the
same
refrain
god
help
us
fisher
folk
suddenly
he
gave
a
quick
start
exclaiming
hark
wife
what
is
that
the
old
woman
dropped
the
wooden
spoon
and
listened
to
the
clear
voices
that
rose
above
the
storm
golden
snow
golden
snow
to
and
fro
over
her
little
heart
we
blow
our
dear
little
sister
golden
snow
open
your
door
that
the
s
glow
may
tinge
the
cheek
of
golden
snow
oh
dear
little
sister
golden
then
came
the
savage
old
trumpeter
and
blew
a
great
blast
close
by
the
door
and
window
of
the
little
hut
it
was
really
quite
startling
and
the
old
woman
clung
to
her
husband
s
arm
but
above
all
they
could
hear
the
shrill
clear
voices
calling
open
the
door
for
the
wild
winds
blow
over
the
heart
of
golden
i
can
not
do
it
said
the
trembling
but
the
old
man
walked
straight
to
the
door
though
his
wife
entreated
him
saying
it
is
the
evil
one
who
calls
without
dear
husband
do
not
open
it
he
lifted
the
latch
fearlessly
with
a
great
bang
in
rushed
the
wind
and
blew
out
the
candle
god
save
us
cried
the
crossing
herself
almost
ready
to
swoon
with
fright
a
bright
glow
from
the
fire
fell
upon
a
willow
basket
covered
with
a
fine
crimson
cloth
as
the
old
man
took
it
up
a
little
wailing
cry
rose
which
touched
the
woman
s
heart
more
than
all
her
fears
taking
it
from
her
husband
she
exclaimed
god
pity
it
it
is
a
little
innocent
child
the
old
man
pressed
hard
upon
the
door
and
drove
out
the
ugly
wind
then
he
came
to
the
fire
and
saw
his
wife
folding
in
her
kind
arms
the
most
beautiful
little
child
that
even
a
poet
could
imagine
she
was
as
white
as
a
only
the
rose
tinge
upon
her
cheeks
and
her
lips
were
like
ripe
cherries
her
hair
was
soft
as
silk
and
lay
in
pretty
waves
of
gold
about
her
head
like
the
shining
crown
of
a
little
princess
the
good
people
were
greatly
bewildered
but
when
they
looked
into
the
liquid
blue
eyes
of
the
little
one
it
seemed
like
a
deep
fountain
of
happiness
that
was
opened
to
them
and
they
were
delighted
beyond
measure
as
they
had
no
children
this
child
seemed
like
a
god
s
gift
and
they
adopted
her
for
their
own
her
little
robes
were
of
the
finest
material
daintily
embroidered
but
among
them
all
there
was
nothing
to
tell
her
name
or
parentage
only
a
coral
necklace
with
a
golden
clasp
engraved
with
the
letters
g
was
ever
any
thing
so
strange
said
the
but
she
is
our
child
now
and
we
will
call
her
golden
snow
for
her
hair
is
shining
like
gold
and
her
complexion
fair
as
the
driven
the
poor
had
now
something
to
love
and
were
never
so
happy
in
their
lives
the
long
winter
gave
place
to
the
pleasant
summer
time
and
the
little
child
grew
lovelier
day
by
day
till
in
all
the
northern
gold
land
there
was
not
a
maiden
who
could
compare
with
her
good
fortune
had
followed
the
fisherman
ever
since
that
stormy
night
he
had
never
drawn
in
his
net
empty
and
there
had
been
always
plenty
in
the
larder
the
old
woman
often
said
it
all
comes
of
golden
snow
she
is
our
luck
as
the
years
went
by
she
had
taught
the
maiden
all
she
knew
herself
which
was
little
enough
to
be
sure
but
the
child
had
other
teachers
from
the
birds
she
received
the
gift
of
song
and
learned
the
wonderful
stories
of
the
far
southern
lands
the
leaves
of
summer
and
the
evergreens
of
winter
whispered
a
thousand
pleasant
things
in
her
ear
but
it
was
the
that
she
loved
best
of
all
the
old
often
heard
them
calling
her
as
they
flew
about
in
the
winter
storm
golden
snow
golden
snow
you
are
one
of
us
when
the
wild
winds
blow
come
out
to
us
from
the
s
glow
you
are
our
sister
golden
then
before
the
could
stop
her
the
little
maiden
would
fly
out
into
the
storm
full
of
joy
dancing
about
as
lightly
as
the
themselves
at
first
the
old
fisherman
would
run
after
her
and
bring
her
in
quickly
for
fear
that
the
chill
of
the
storm
would
kill
her
but
when
he
saw
that
this
only
saddened
her
and
how
rosy
laughing
and
healthful
she
always
was
with
the
he
said
to
the
they
do
not
harm
her
let
the
child
have
her
after
this
they
would
stand
by
the
window
watching
her
and
very
often
they
heard
her
saying
my
pretty
sisters
how
merry
we
are
how
much
i
love
you
the
winter
oh
the
winter
is
the
joy
time
and
my
sisters
the
fairies
of
the
then
the
would
answer
golden
snow
many
maids
are
fair
we
know
but
none
like
the
princess
golden
so
it
happened
that
the
old
found
out
that
golden
snow
was
a
princess
and
they
no
longer
wondered
at
the
innate
grace
of
the
lovely
child
every
thing
she
said
and
all
her
ways
was
so
charming
that
it
was
impossible
to
resist
her
but
as
she
was
so
gentle
and
good
this
was
all
well
every
night
before
she
went
to
sleep
she
said
reverently
our
father
who
art
in
the
loving
god
heard
her
and
kept
her
heart
pure
as
she
passed
on
through
the
portals
of
childhood
into
timid
dreamy
maidenhood
one
day
in
the
winter
time
when
golden
snow
was
about
fifteen
years
old
a
herald
rode
by
the
fisherman
s
cottage
crying
the
prince
the
prince
will
marry
the
most
beautiful
maiden
in
all
the
gold
land
hear
hear
the
prince
will
marry
the
maiden
in
all
the
gold
land
then
the
old
fisherman
went
out
and
asked
the
messenger
what
it
meant
it
means
this
replied
the
man
that
though
the
prince
and
all
his
ancestors
were
born
in
russia
he
has
determined
to
marry
only
in
the
gold
land
and
the
most
beautiful
maiden
for
you
must
know
that
though
he
is
so
high
born
in
the
old
world
the
estates
are
getting
poor
but
here
he
has
won
every
thing
he
has
opened
a
mine
so
rich
that
he
will
never
be
able
to
count
his
money
he
wishes
his
children
to
be
real
lords
of
the
gold
land
to
be
miner
princes
so
here
he
will
marry
even
the
poorest
maiden
but
she
must
be
the
most
then
he
told
how
all
the
lovely
young
girls
in
the
country
were
invited
to
a
great
feast
at
the
castle
and
that
the
prince
would
choose
a
wife
from
among
them
after
this
the
herald
went
crying
before
every
house
no
matter
how
humble
for
this
was
the
command
of
the
prince
the
old
fisherman
went
into
the
cottage
and
told
all
to
the
golden
snow
is
the
most
beautiful
maiden
she
answered
yes
said
the
old
man
golden
snow
is
the
most
beautiful
but
he
who
wins
must
seek
her
she
should
not
go
to
the
castle
for
a
husband
even
though
he
were
a
this
grieved
the
mother
for
all
her
life
she
had
eaten
the
bread
of
toil
and
she
longed
to
see
the
dainty
fingers
of
her
adopted
child
covered
with
rings
and
to
have
her
wear
costly
trailing
robes
such
as
the
wives
and
daughters
of
the
great
miner
princes
wore
in
the
corner
sat
golden
snow
braiding
her
silken
hair
which
was
so
long
it
swept
the
ground
she
bound
the
broad
plaits
about
her
head
and
formed
a
was
there
ever
any
thing
like
it
said
the
old
woman
sighing
and
passing
her
brown
hand
fondly
over
the
beautiful
tresses
the
father
is
right
replied
golden
snow
my
sisters
will
see
to
it
have
never
a
care
mother
and
the
maiden
began
singing
the
nightingale
s
song
till
the
rafters
of
the
old
hut
rang
with
the
silvery
melody
the
chit
of
a
child
has
never
a
care
thought
the
old
woman
but
it
is
different
with
me
who
know
what
life
all
through
the
north
land
there
was
great
excitement
everywhere
the
young
girls
wrought
upon
gay
dresses
and
the
fathers
and
mothers
consulted
together
that
nothing
might
be
wanting
in
the
ball
costumes
of
their
daughters
for
each
one
thought
our
child
is
the
most
beautiful
the
morning
dawned
without
a
ray
of
sunshine
only
the
heavy
covered
the
sky
my
sisters
are
getting
ready
for
the
ball
laughed
golden
snow
very
soon
the
messengers
will
be
flying
out
after
the
fleecy
fringes
and
ribbons
for
every
one
must
be
dressed
in
the
real
court
silly
child
silly
child
answered
the
old
woman
yet
silently
she
thought
if
my
daughter
could
go
to
the
ball
the
prince
would
surely
fall
in
love
with
her
for
in
all
the
north
land
she
is
the
only
true
see
they
are
coming
mother
exclaimed
golden
snow
clapping
her
hands
with
delight
the
old
woman
looked
out
of
the
window
and
saw
everywhere
the
flying
about
like
little
madcaps
over
hill
and
valley
it
seemed
a
long
day
to
her
there
was
a
chill
in
the
air
and
she
was
not
happy
satos
the
old
fisherman
came
in
saying
in
his
voice
it
will
be
stormy
ah
well
replied
she
what
will
that
matter
to
us
who
stay
at
home
just
then
a
knock
came
at
the
door
and
when
the
old
man
opened
it
he
saw
a
stately
lady
who
was
so
covered
with
snow
that
no
part
of
her
dress
could
be
seen
it
was
like
a
cloak
about
her
upon
her
head
she
wore
a
band
of
shining
brilliants
that
so
dazzled
the
old
man
that
he
could
not
speak
a
word
the
lady
stepped
into
the
cottage
and
when
she
saw
golden
snow
she
embraced
her
fondly
saying
my
dear
child
i
have
not
forgotten
that
it
is
your
birthday
and
that
you
are
now
fifteen
years
she
took
a
little
box
from
her
pocket
and
placed
it
upon
the
floor
in
a
few
moments
it
had
increased
to
so
great
a
size
that
it
was
large
enough
to
hold
the
entire
wardrobe
of
a
lady
golden
snow
kissed
her
hand
and
thanked
her
again
and
again
i
must
go
now
said
the
lady
i
can
not
endure
the
heat
but
never
fear
my
child
for
your
sisters
shall
attend
to
every
thing
now
and
again
she
embraced
the
young
maiden
tenderly
and
in
a
moment
was
gone
the
fisherman
and
his
wife
had
been
standing
gazing
upon
this
scene
in
silent
amazement
but
when
the
lady
had
disappeared
and
they
could
not
see
how
the
old
woman
recovered
her
voice
father
she
exclaimed
the
lady
she
did
not
go
out
at
the
door
nor
the
window
how
did
she
go
don
t
ask
me
wife
i
don
t
know
any
thing
replied
the
old
man
in
a
bewildered
way
i
believe
i
rather
think
i
am
in
the
and
after
this
he
sank
into
a
chair
and
did
not
speak
again
for
an
hour
he
was
trying
in
vain
to
get
out
of
the
fog
a
clear
ringing
laugh
startled
the
old
man
it
was
golden
snow
whose
eyes
were
glistening
with
mirth
who
was
she
child
asked
the
it
was
the
snow
queen
mother
replied
the
young
girl
as
soon
as
she
could
speak
for
laughing
but
now
let
us
look
at
my
birthday
the
good
woman
s
curiosity
overcame
her
wonder
so
taking
the
silver
key
she
unlocked
the
great
box
and
displayed
such
a
quantity
of
beautiful
things
that
her
admiration
was
as
great
as
her
amazement
there
were
shining
robes
of
silver
and
gold
cloth
and
rich
cloaks
of
fur
ornamented
with
glittering
gems
golden
snow
was
almost
wild
with
delight
and
her
beaming
eyes
glistened
with
the
unexpected
pleasure
and
the
though
the
mysticism
troubled
her
greatly
could
not
but
rejoice
at
the
sight
of
all
these
treasures
she
took
up
a
robe
of
silver
cloth
richly
embroidered
with
gold
saying
oh
my
child
if
you
could
only
wear
this
to
the
ball
i
should
live
to
see
you
the
bride
of
a
real
prince
and
the
richest
man
in
all
the
russian
possessions
except
the
great
czar
the
old
woman
sighed
heavily
adding
it
would
not
be
right
to
say
aught
against
the
for
there
is
nobody
like
him
but
i
do
believe
he
would
have
his
way
if
old
nickey
bend
stood
at
the
door
with
his
cloven
hoof
so
it
is
no
use
talking
we
must
give
up
the
ball
my
and
i
am
content
said
golden
snow
fastening
a
string
of
pearls
into
the
shining
crown
that
she
had
formed
of
her
own
abundant
tresses
then
she
threw
about
her
a
rich
fur
mantle
made
of
a
thousand
different
skins
of
the
finest
quality
i
must
go
now
and
dance
for
a
while
with
my
sisters
remember
mother
she
added
as
the
old
woman
shook
her
head
it
is
my
birthnight
you
would
not
deny
the
old
woman
listened
and
heard
the
clear
voices
calling
tis
thy
birthnight
sister
fair
join
us
fairies
of
the
air
where
the
round
us
blow
we
are
waiting
golden
kiss
me
mother
for
i
must
go
said
the
maiden
eagerly
and
with
the
old
woman
s
kiss
warm
upon
her
cheek
she
ran
out
and
danced
with
the
pretty
till
her
face
glowed
and
her
eyes
sparkled
like
the
rich
carbuncle
that
clasped
her
mantle
it
is
getting
late
come
in
child
come
in
called
the
old
woman
who
grew
weary
waiting
the
maiden
kissed
her
white
hands
to
the
fleecy
singing
like
a
bird
good
night
white
golden
snow
now
must
go
sisters
white
good
night
good
night
there
was
a
little
sound
as
though
soft
hands
met
and
young
lips
kissed
each
other
and
golden
snow
ran
into
the
house
rosy
joyous
and
ready
to
obey
the
good
mother
even
when
she
said
go
to
bed
my
dear
child
though
the
bright
eyes
were
still
wide
awake
you
will
tell
me
a
story
mother
said
the
young
girl
in
a
coaxing
tone
so
the
old
woman
sat
down
by
the
bedside
and
told
her
a
wonderful
story
of
the
olden
time
how
a
fair
princess
was
changed
into
a
blue
bird
by
the
incantations
of
a
wicked
old
witch
who
had
red
eyes
and
had
studied
the
black
art
and
how
after
a
long
time
the
cruel
enchantment
was
broken
by
a
brave
young
prince
who
had
marvelous
adventures
so
it
all
ended
happily
said
the
old
mother
bending
over
golden
snow
to
kiss
her
then
she
saw
that
the
young
maiden
slept
and
she
stood
gazing
upon
her
fresh
young
face
and
thinking
curious
thoughts
which
somehow
were
enwoven
with
the
web
of
the
story
she
had
been
telling
but
all
ended
in
this
golden
snow
is
the
most
beautiful
at
the
castle
the
musicians
were
playing
and
the
grand
saloon
was
like
an
enchanted
hall
with
fragrant
air
and
gorgeous
light
the
delicious
music
stole
into
the
heart
and
throbbed
in
the
impassioned
pulses
of
the
guests
the
noble
gentlemen
and
fair
ladies
the
brunette
rivaled
the
delicate
blonde
and
all
were
lovely
in
their
dainty
robes
with
the
soft
mellow
light
floating
around
them
amid
the
festive
throng
with
courtly
hospitality
walked
the
young
prince
the
winds
and
sun
had
bronzed
his
handsome
face
and
the
damp
exhalations
of
the
mine
had
moistened
the
rich
curls
of
his
dark
hair
yet
nothing
in
all
the
rough
miner
s
life
had
harmed
him
in
any
way
he
was
a
prince
born
and
a
real
prince
at
heart
there
was
not
a
father
in
the
north
land
who
would
not
have
taken
him
by
the
hand
nor
a
mother
who
would
not
have
been
proud
of
him
even
the
young
maidens
whispered
together
he
is
a
one
could
look
up
to
him
and
that
is
the
best
of
the
prince
was
attentive
to
all
his
fair
guests
but
he
danced
more
with
the
consul
s
daughter
she
was
a
proud
young
beauty
so
ambitious
that
she
had
treated
with
scorn
many
an
honest
heart
in
the
gold
land
my
was
younger
brother
to
an
earl
and
i
am
beautiful
enough
to
be
the
bride
of
a
nobleman
she
would
say
as
she
sat
by
her
mirror
when
the
herald
came
with
the
invitation
to
the
ball
she
determined
in
her
mind
to
marry
the
rich
russian
prince
of
course
she
thought
i
am
the
most
beautiful
so
that
is
settled
i
will
go
back
to
the
old
world
where
i
will
astonish
even
the
queen
with
the
richness
of
my
dress
and
the
luster
of
my
jewels
and
every
one
will
pay
court
to
the
princess
of
the
gold
so
she
went
to
the
ball
with
glistening
eyes
and
a
proud
flush
upon
her
cheek
and
all
the
guests
whispered
the
consul
s
daughter
is
the
most
beautiful
it
found
an
echo
in
the
heart
of
the
prince
so
that
the
matter
seemed
really
decided
just
then
the
music
ceased
for
the
musicians
were
weary
the
dancers
were
quite
out
of
breath
and
the
windows
of
the
grand
saloon
were
opened
to
admit
the
refreshing
air
without
the
were
holding
their
revel
in
honor
of
the
princess
golden
snow
up
to
the
great
carved
windows
they
flew
and
their
clear
voices
sounded
through
the
so
distinctly
that
the
prince
and
all
his
guests
heard
them
the
consul
s
daughter
is
fair
we
know
but
not
like
the
beautiful
golden
snow
there
are
lovely
maids
at
the
castle
ball
but
golden
snow
is
fairer
than
the
flush
of
pride
in
the
cheek
of
the
consul
s
daughter
gave
place
to
the
deeper
red
of
anger
her
eyes
shot
flames
of
fire
and
her
brow
darkened
with
heavy
clouds
what
does
this
insult
mean
she
said
sharply
to
the
prince
the
young
man
gave
a
start
as
though
he
were
awaking
from
a
dream
it
is
strange
he
answered
but
it
shall
be
looked
to
lady
what
it
means
i
can
not
he
called
his
servants
telling
them
to
bring
in
the
people
who
were
crying
without
when
the
men
returned
they
were
trembling
and
seemed
quite
afraid
there
are
a
hundred
voices
but
no
person
is
without
only
the
flying
about
like
living
then
the
prince
went
out
himself
and
a
great
search
was
made
all
over
the
grounds
of
the
castle
but
not
a
human
being
could
be
found
still
everywhere
the
voices
could
be
heard
and
the
thickened
till
at
last
the
search
was
given
up
it
is
the
work
of
magic
and
evil
said
the
consul
and
all
his
friends
but
the
prince
offered
a
great
reward
to
any
one
who
would
find
the
beautiful
golden
snow
and
all
the
guests
were
invited
to
return
in
one
week
s
time
all
the
week
the
young
prince
could
think
of
nothing
but
the
mysterious
voices
that
pursued
him
and
everywhere
his
messengers
were
seeking
for
the
beautiful
golden
snow
the
consul
s
daughter
was
nearly
wild
with
rage
and
disappointment
one
evening
in
the
dusky
twilight
she
went
down
into
the
shadows
of
a
dark
cañon
and
consulted
a
wicked
old
witch
who
lived
in
a
dismal
cavern
am
i
not
the
fairest
of
all
the
maidens
in
the
new
world
she
asked
but
what
means
this
cry
of
golden
snow
you
are
very
fair
answered
the
old
witch
but
i
must
read
the
so
she
went
down
into
the
lowest
depths
of
the
cañon
and
in
the
bottom
of
a
deep
well
she
read
the
stars
there
were
maidens
fair
at
the
prince
s
ball
but
golden
snow
is
fairer
than
what
does
it
mean
asked
the
consul
s
daughter
pale
and
trembling
with
emotion
i
will
tell
you
golden
snow
is
the
elixir
of
beauty
and
if
you
can
obtain
it
and
wash
in
it
you
will
become
the
most
enchanting
maiden
in
the
where
shall
i
find
it
i
will
give
you
any
thing
any
thing
for
this
elixir
of
then
the
witch
told
her
if
she
would
promise
to
be
her
slave
one
day
in
every
month
she
would
help
her
to
procure
the
great
treasure
i
can
buy
the
old
woman
off
when
i
become
the
bride
of
the
rich
prince
thought
the
young
girl
so
she
promised
and
the
witch
brought
out
a
wrinkled
yellow
parchment
and
wrote
the
contract
piercing
the
maiden
s
arm
she
dipped
the
pen
in
the
blood
and
the
consul
s
daughter
signed
it
with
a
trembling
hand
that
is
good
said
the
old
witch
her
red
eyes
glaring
at
the
maiden
now
you
must
go
to
the
summit
of
the
black
mountain
just
over
the
prince
s
mine
and
bring
me
a
quart
of
the
snow
that
has
drifted
round
the
roots
of
the
blasted
pine
all
your
gold
and
jewelry
you
must
bring
and
at
twelve
o
clock
night
come
to
the
cavern
and
i
will
give
you
the
elixir
of
beauty
the
wonderful
golden
the
consul
s
daughter
took
off
all
her
jewelry
necklace
bracelets
and
all
the
gold
she
had
she
gave
to
the
old
witch
then
she
toiled
up
the
steep
mountain
and
at
last
weary
and
worn
returned
with
the
snow
from
the
roots
of
the
blasted
pine
when
the
young
girl
had
left
the
cavern
the
woman
bent
over
the
blazing
fire
with
alembic
and
crucible
who
can
tell
the
wonderful
mystery
she
muttered
to
herself
as
the
liquid
boiled
up
yellow
as
gold
i
myself
will
wash
in
it
and
become
young
and
fair
the
night
came
on
in
darkness
and
at
eleven
o
clock
the
old
witch
carried
the
liquid
out
in
the
chill
air
and
with
her
red
eyes
that
could
see
best
in
the
darkness
watched
it
as
it
changed
in
form
till
just
as
the
bell
in
the
church
tower
rung
out
twelve
she
saw
before
her
the
elixir
of
beauty
the
magic
golden
snow
just
at
that
moment
she
heard
the
voice
of
the
consul
s
daughter
calling
it
is
so
dark
i
can
not
see
give
me
your
hand
and
lead
me
to
the
elixir
of
beauty
i
have
dared
so
much
for
it
i
am
almost
dead
with
in
a
moment
answered
the
old
woman
and
she
slipped
the
golden
snow
into
a
crevice
in
the
rock
leaving
only
a
little
for
the
maiden
reaching
out
her
hand
she
led
the
trembling
girl
into
the
cavern
and
taking
an
ivory
box
filled
it
with
pure
white
snow
sprinkling
over
it
the
remnant
of
the
elixir
of
beauty
she
gave
it
to
the
maiden
saying
wash
in
it
and
you
will
become
as
lovely
as
the
when
the
young
girl
opened
the
box
it
looked
to
her
yellow
and
shiny
for
the
old
witch
had
cast
a
glamour
over
it
so
she
went
away
quite
satisfied
she
concealed
her
treasure
in
her
private
closet
and
every
night
after
all
in
the
house
had
retired
she
washed
her
face
and
because
there
was
the
remnant
of
the
elixir
of
beauty
in
it
she
became
fairer
every
day
all
who
saw
her
wondered
and
said
surely
the
consul
s
daughter
is
the
most
beautiful
maiden
through
the
whole
week
the
herald
of
the
prince
rode
over
the
gold
land
everywhere
seeking
for
golden
snow
once
he
passed
the
fisherman
s
cottage
but
that
morning
the
fisher
folk
and
their
adopted
child
had
gone
down
to
the
beach
as
chance
would
have
it
they
missed
the
messenger
again
the
castle
was
illuminated
and
the
guests
were
assembled
there
were
beautiful
maidens
but
the
consul
s
daughter
shone
like
the
morning
again
the
heart
of
the
prince
the
wondering
admiration
of
the
guests
and
his
deep
dark
eyes
flashed
with
a
strange
magnetic
fire
as
the
evening
advanced
it
grew
warm
with
the
great
lights
flashing
everywhere
and
the
delicious
notes
of
the
music
vibrating
and
thrilling
in
every
form
do
not
open
the
windows
entreated
the
consul
s
daughter
for
the
are
drifting
with
the
wind
and
the
night
air
is
a
shudder
passed
over
her
so
they
opened
only
the
doors
of
the
grand
saloon
but
one
of
the
warm
and
weary
dancers
went
out
secretly
and
opened
the
carved
oval
window
of
the
great
hall
then
louder
than
ever
the
clear
voices
floated
into
the
hall
and
in
all
the
winding
corridors
found
a
hundred
echoes
till
the
whole
castle
reverberated
with
them
the
consul
s
daughter
is
fair
we
know
but
not
like
the
princess
golden
snow
there
are
lovely
maids
at
the
castle
ball
but
golden
snow
is
fairer
than
the
consul
s
daughter
was
again
frantic
with
rage
her
eyes
glared
with
fury
and
her
face
grew
frightful
with
the
heat
of
passion
the
dream
had
passed
forever
from
the
heart
of
the
prince
and
he
wondered
that
only
a
moment
before
he
had
thought
the
face
so
contorted
with
anger
beautiful
as
a
painter
s
bright
ideal
everywhere
they
searched
but
could
find
no
one
so
while
the
mystery
deepened
the
ball
ended
in
the
morning
the
prince
mounted
a
fine
black
horse
and
started
off
as
for
a
long
journey
for
months
he
wandered
over
the
northern
gold
land
seeking
everywhere
the
princess
golden
snow
at
last
when
he
had
given
up
all
hope
and
was
returning
disappointed
to
the
castle
he
chanced
to
ride
by
the
fisherman
s
cottage
the
old
fisher
folk
sat
in
the
corner
mending
a
net
and
golden
snow
in
her
rich
marvelous
voice
was
singing
to
them
one
of
the
songs
of
the
sea
the
prince
stopped
his
horse
and
listened
drinking
in
every
note
of
the
delicious
melody
when
it
was
ended
he
dismounted
and
leading
his
horse
by
the
bridle
knocked
at
the
door
and
the
opened
it
tell
me
good
mother
who
it
was
singing
for
in
all
my
life
never
a
voice
came
so
into
my
it
was
the
princess
golden
snow
answered
the
old
woman
proudly
the
prince
entered
and
saw
golden
snow
in
all
her
matchless
grace
and
beauty
around
her
head
was
her
crown
of
shining
hair
decked
with
brilliants
and
a
mantle
of
the
richest
fur
covered
her
she
had
only
just
returned
from
the
with
the
rich
flush
of
exercise
upon
her
cheek
and
her
eyes
were
beaming
with
the
rare
beauty
of
her
gentle
spirit
the
fisherman
rose
to
meet
the
young
prince
who
told
him
in
his
handsome
manly
way
how
all
over
the
north
land
he
had
been
seeking
for
the
princess
golden
snow
and
how
at
last
when
hope
was
almost
dying
he
had
found
the
treasure
the
old
man
listened
gravely
then
he
placed
the
white
hand
of
the
maiden
in
the
young
man
s
strong
true
palm
saying
not
because
you
are
a
russian
prince
but
because
you
are
one
of
god
s
noblemen
i
give
you
my
dear
child
take
her
for
in
her
loving
heart
she
is
the
most
beautiful
thus
the
young
people
were
betrothed
in
the
cottage
of
the
good
fisher
folk
and
when
the
news
spread
over
the
country
there
was
great
rejoicing
they
were
married
at
the
old
church
where
the
stones
are
covered
with
lichens
and
many
a
poor
man
s
heart
was
made
glad
by
the
generosity
of
the
prince
that
day
the
consul
s
daughter
was
too
angry
to
join
in
the
festivities
but
all
the
former
guests
of
the
castle
were
there
and
among
them
sat
the
fisher
folk
in
the
place
of
honor
all
over
the
northern
gold
land
flew
the
joyous
dancing
at
the
wedding
of
their
princess
everywhere
in
the
grand
saloon
and
through
the
winding
corridors
of
the
castle
with
strains
of
rich
music
mingled
the
clear
mysterious
voices
all
the
north
land
now
shall
know
the
most
beautiful
maiden
is
golden
snow
we
are
her
sisters
white
she
is
the
princess
of
golden
thus
all
were
happy
save
the
consul
s
daughter
whose
pride
and
rage
devoured
her
for
one
day
every
month
she
was
doomed
to
be
the
slave
of
the
wicked
old
witch
which
was
wretchedness
at
last
one
night
when
her
tasks
had
been
too
hard
for
endurance
from
her
great
weariness
and
sickness
of
heart
she
cried
out
o
lord
christ
forgive
and
pity
me
then
the
old
witch
gave
a
wild
shriek
of
madness
and
disappeared
in
the
black
shadows
of
the
cañon
forever
because
she
had
hidden
part
of
the
golden
snow
by
this
prayer
the
maiden
was
delivered
out
of
her
hands
the
selfish
pride
of
the
consul
s
daughter
was
humbled
and
she
grew
so
gentle
and
good
that
all
even
the
poor
and
dependent
learned
to
love
her
so
that
she
too
became
in
heart
a
beautiful
maiden
gracia
and
catrina
near
the
mission
of
san
diego
lived
a
very
wealthy
spaniard
and
his
wife
the
most
beautiful
señora
in
all
the
country
for
many
miles
around
they
had
every
thing
about
them
to
make
life
pleasant
a
fine
orange
and
lemon
grove
a
large
garden
containing
olive
almond
peach
and
pear
trees
indeed
all
kinds
of
fruit
and
flowers
that
the
luxurious
climate
of
san
diego
produces
their
house
was
pleasant
and
furnished
with
all
the
comforts
and
many
of
the
luxuries
of
life
and
when
god
blessed
them
with
a
little
daughter
they
felt
as
though
there
was
nothing
left
to
wish
for
the
child
resembled
her
beautiful
mamma
in
features
as
much
as
the
tiny
bud
is
like
the
rose
the
hidalgo
had
never
ceased
to
regard
his
wife
with
that
kind
of
worshipful
love
so
dear
to
woman
s
heart
and
his
great
delight
was
to
watch
tenderly
over
mother
and
child
that
even
the
slightest
wish
might
not
pass
ungratified
as
it
grew
older
the
little
one
learned
to
recognize
the
glance
of
love
and
when
at
last
it
would
open
its
large
dark
eyes
and
look
eagerly
at
the
dear
papa
and
holding
out
its
tiny
hands
crow
with
all
the
innocent
delight
of
infancy
he
would
take
the
babe
in
his
arms
and
all
the
harsh
lines
about
his
mouth
softened
into
smiles
he
was
happier
than
any
one
in
the
whole
country
except
the
delighted
mother
who
was
never
weary
of
looking
upon
the
darling
of
her
heart
illustration
and
the
señora
was
a
devout
catholic
and
though
she
seldom
left
the
child
alone
with
her
nurse
as
the
feast
of
corpus
christi
approached
she
felt
that
this
year
above
all
others
so
blessed
to
her
in
the
birth
of
her
beloved
child
she
should
assist
in
the
celebration
on
the
morning
of
the
holy
day
she
gave
her
treasure
with
many
charges
into
the
care
of
the
old
servant
bidding
her
on
no
account
whatever
to
leave
the
child
even
for
a
moment
twice
as
she
was
about
leaving
she
returned
to
embrace
the
little
one
with
her
soft
eyes
filled
with
tears
as
she
covered
the
face
of
her
babe
with
kisses
she
whispered
mamma
loves
thee
foolish
mamma
trembles
to
leave
thee
yet
the
divine
eye
of
the
holy
mother
will
watch
over
thee
vida
mia
vida
then
came
the
sound
of
music
and
the
voice
of
the
hidalgo
calling
her
so
with
a
last
embrace
with
mingled
smiles
and
tears
the
young
mother
parted
from
her
little
one
for
the
first
time
since
its
birth
there
was
to
be
a
large
procession
formed
upon
the
plaza
where
rustic
booths
were
built
and
ornamented
according
to
the
taste
and
wealth
of
the
devout
who
often
sacrificed
the
comfort
of
weeks
to
be
able
to
give
this
tribute
of
honor
to
the
holy
mother
and
the
blessed
christ
pictures
of
the
madonna
were
placed
upon
the
rude
altars
entwined
with
beautiful
wreaths
while
rare
flowers
shed
their
rich
incense
from
costly
vases
the
señora
had
spared
neither
money
nor
pains
it
is
in
honor
of
the
merciful
christ
the
redeemer
of
the
world
she
said
let
every
thing
be
as
worthy
of
his
greatness
as
possible
it
will
fall
far
short
of
what
my
thankful
heart
would
pictures
from
the
hands
of
the
old
masters
were
brought
from
the
house
with
tapestry
and
fringes
and
every
thing
that
the
luxurious
climate
produced
was
added
until
nothing
seemed
wanting
to
make
it
the
one
booth
of
enchanting
beauty
the
señora
superintended
the
arrangement
of
all
while
the
señor
sat
a
little
apart
watching
with
delight
the
magic
workings
of
her
exquisite
taste
and
refinement
all
this
time
the
nurse
held
the
infant
in
her
arms
singing
quaint
old
indian
ballads
rocking
her
to
and
fro
with
a
soothing
motion
till
at
last
the
restless
fingers
were
stilled
and
the
pretty
eyes
closed
the
little
one
slept
and
dreamed
no
doubt
such
dreams
as
the
loving
god
sends
to
guileless
infancy
just
then
the
procession
started
and
the
music
fell
upon
the
ear
of
the
young
indian
girl
who
was
always
near
to
wait
upon
old
macata
the
nurse
macata
she
said
as
she
started
lightly
from
the
mat
on
which
she
was
sitting
it
touches
my
heart
i
must
go
see
the
baby
sleeps
nothing
can
harm
it
come
mother
macata
only
for
a
moment
nothing
can
harm
it
said
the
old
indian
as
she
laid
the
child
in
its
little
straw
cradle
for
she
too
loved
the
festive
sight
and
glad
music
of
the
she
had
wished
of
all
things
to
join
the
gossips
of
the
mission
on
the
plaza
but
since
that
could
not
be
she
saw
no
reason
while
the
child
was
sleeping
so
sweetly
that
she
should
not
go
to
the
garden
wall
and
for
a
few
moments
catch
a
passing
glimpse
of
the
gay
procession
she
bent
over
the
child
patting
it
softly
with
her
great
strong
hand
and
singing
in
a
low
voice
sleep
baby
sleep
while
i
softly
creep
to
the
roadside
near
sleep
baby
the
little
form
was
so
still
and
peaceful
surely
there
could
be
no
danger
so
the
nurse
who
loved
her
dearly
knelt
down
and
kissed
her
very
lightly
saying
in
the
indian
tongue
master
of
life
preserve
the
little
white
again
she
pressed
her
dusky
lips
to
the
sweet
little
face
so
peaceful
in
its
innocent
repose
then
ran
away
through
the
garden
to
the
roadside
with
her
companion
the
indian
girl
it
was
a
rare
sight
in
the
eyes
of
these
simple
indians
that
long
procession
with
its
swelling
music
and
waving
banners
all
the
indian
lads
and
maidens
in
the
country
were
there
dressed
in
their
gala
attire
while
the
handkerchiefs
and
shawls
of
the
more
rustic
señoras
as
they
rode
by
on
horseback
added
not
a
little
to
the
festive
scene
for
full
fifteen
minutes
they
sat
watching
the
procession
crouching
behind
the
garden
wall
that
the
señora
might
not
see
them
well
they
knew
her
eyes
would
be
attracted
by
the
magnetism
of
love
to
her
child
and
home
see
mother
macata
said
the
young
girl
sorrowfully
there
are
all
my
mates
while
i
am
here
oh
how
i
wish
i
could
go
with
them
just
then
the
señora
passed
and
mid
all
the
joy
of
the
occasion
macata
saw
a
look
of
deep
solicitude
in
her
face
as
she
turned
toward
the
house
we
must
go
said
the
old
woman
taking
the
hand
of
the
young
girl
only
one
moment
replied
the
maiden
and
while
old
macata
yielded
she
could
not
suppress
an
emotion
of
uneasiness
which
the
señora
s
look
had
nervously
roused
now
now
said
the
old
woman
nervously
as
again
she
clasped
the
hand
of
the
girl
and
dragged
her
away
from
the
attractive
scene
you
know
the
baby
sleeps
said
the
girl
pettishly
but
macata
in
her
uneasiness
hurried
onward
they
passed
through
the
pleasant
garden
into
the
silent
house
and
the
softly
shaded
room
where
they
had
left
the
sleeping
child
there
stood
the
dainty
little
cradle
but
the
child
was
gone
at
first
they
thought
some
of
the
servants
had
returned
and
taken
it
to
some
other
room
but
when
they
had
searched
the
whole
house
and
ran
calling
in
vain
through
the
garden
they
were
almost
wild
with
fright
tears
streamed
from
the
eyes
of
the
young
girl
as
she
looked
helplessly
into
the
face
of
old
macata
who
tore
her
long
hair
and
moaned
piteously
she
could
not
cease
looking
although
it
seemed
hopeless
in
so
short
a
time
to
disappear
and
leave
no
trace
behind
to
aid
this
search
the
child
the
poor
little
innocent
child
she
loved
so
dearly
gone
she
knew
not
where
how
could
she
meet
the
father
and
mother
thus
full
of
despair
she
ran
about
looking
in
vain
and
calling
wildly
upon
her
darling
until
the
señor
and
his
wife
returned
to
picture
the
scene
that
followed
would
be
impossible
the
torturing
grief
of
the
unhappy
father
was
mingled
with
all
the
terrors
of
suspense
and
the
desolate
heart
of
the
sorrowing
mother
refused
to
be
comforted
day
and
night
she
sobbed
bitterly
would
that
god
had
taken
my
baby
to
himself
the
whole
country
was
roused
the
search
continued
for
many
days
till
hope
died
out
in
every
heart
then
it
was
that
a
fearful
fever
seized
the
mother
exhausted
by
grief
want
of
sleep
and
the
fatigues
of
a
hopeless
search
for
weeks
her
life
was
despaired
of
and
when
at
last
the
fever
left
her
the
light
had
gone
from
her
eye
the
smile
from
her
lips
and
the
hope
of
happiness
from
her
heart
the
old
macata
never
left
her
side
at
first
the
mother
shuddered
when
she
came
near
but
as
she
looked
upon
the
hair
of
the
old
woman
which
since
the
loss
of
the
child
had
become
white
as
the
driven
snow
her
heart
softened
and
she
shed
her
first
tears
upon
the
bosom
of
the
penitent
and
sorrowing
nurse
for
many
weeks
the
luxury
of
tears
had
been
denied
her
and
from
that
first
bursting
of
the
of
her
grief
she
could
not
bear
the
old
indian
long
out
of
her
sight
a
mutual
sorrow
bound
their
hearts
together
macata
could
never
do
enough
for
the
dear
sad
señora
but
sometimes
she
would
go
to
her
saying
bless
me
now
señora
dear
i
am
going
to
look
for
our
then
the
señora
would
bless
her
and
say
go
my
poor
all
day
long
she
roamed
through
woods
down
deep
into
the
shadowy
cañons
or
upon
the
mountain
tops
after
weary
hours
and
sometimes
days
of
fruitless
search
she
would
return
worn
and
with
her
vain
wanderings
kneeling
before
the
señora
weeping
and
wringing
her
hands
she
would
cry
oh
dear
señora
forgive
me
i
have
not
found
our
baby
i
lost
it
but
i
will
find
it
i
will
find
it
before
i
die
so
help
me
wacondah
great
spirit
often
the
old
woman
fell
fainting
at
the
feet
of
her
beloved
señora
who
would
have
her
raised
tenderly
and
placed
upon
the
bed
where
for
hours
she
sat
by
her
watching
and
weeping
thus
these
two
sorrowing
ones
the
mother
and
the
nurse
became
very
dear
to
each
other
the
father
mourned
deeply
but
to
the
heart
of
man
time
brings
its
softening
balm
he
loved
his
wife
fondly
and
for
her
sake
sometimes
tried
to
waken
a
hope
that
the
child
might
be
restored
to
them
yet
within
his
shadowed
heart
he
mourned
the
precious
one
as
dead
very
sadly
he
missed
the
tiny
outstretched
hands
that
once
were
sure
to
greet
him
and
that
radiant
little
face
that
was
all
the
world
to
him
and
as
months
and
years
went
by
whenever
he
looked
upon
a
little
maiden
full
of
grace
and
beauty
he
would
press
his
hand
to
his
heart
in
sorrow
for
what
might
have
sometimes
the
señora
leaning
her
weary
head
on
his
breast
would
say
i
shall
know
my
darling
no
matter
how
many
years
shall
pass
before
we
then
she
would
clasp
her
hands
exclaiming
what
if
i
should
die
before
macata
finds
her
then
oh
then
i
shall
know
her
in
heaven
she
would
bow
her
head
lower
upon
the
beloved
breast
in
prayer
thus
she
would
remain
till
the
tender
voice
of
the
hidalgo
aroused
her
then
she
would
clasp
her
thin
hands
about
his
neck
and
look
pityingly
into
his
eyes
to
see
the
sorrow
of
her
heart
reflected
there
thus
it
was
with
the
parents
as
the
years
passed
sadly
by
but
all
the
while
the
seasons
went
and
came
again
the
sunshine
gladdened
the
earth
the
rainbow
beautified
the
shower
the
flowers
blossomed
in
the
garden
and
young
hearts
beat
happily
as
theirs
upon
their
bridal
day
on
that
bright
morning
of
the
of
corpus
christi
which
resulted
so
unfortunately
for
the
hidalgo
and
the
poor
señora
macata
had
not
noticed
that
the
garden
gate
was
left
unlocked
nor
in
her
haste
did
she
see
the
crouching
form
of
a
woman
hiding
behind
the
no
sooner
was
she
and
the
young
girl
out
of
sight
than
the
woman
rose
stealthily
and
gathering
up
her
coarse
brown
cloak
around
her
glided
swiftly
through
the
garden
and
into
the
room
where
the
cradle
stood
still
moving
from
the
parting
motion
of
macata
s
hand
glancing
hastily
around
she
snatched
up
the
still
sleeping
child
and
wrapping
it
in
the
folds
of
her
cloak
ran
out
of
the
garden
away
from
the
road
on
through
the
and
before
macata
and
the
girl
returned
was
far
away
out
of
sight
still
on
she
went
through
the
vineyard
and
over
the
hill
beyond
nor
did
she
pause
for
a
moment
after
she
entered
the
thick
wood
until
miles
away
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
deep
down
in
a
cañon
she
came
to
a
rude
cottage
overhung
with
trees
and
rocks
all
day
long
the
delicate
child
had
been
out
in
the
burning
sunshine
tasting
nothing
but
a
tortilla
moistened
in
water
when
they
entered
the
cottage
she
had
cried
herself
to
sleep
and
her
little
head
rested
wearily
upon
the
bosom
of
the
woman
who
had
stolen
her
from
her
mother
and
her
happy
home
on
the
floor
sat
a
little
girl
shelling
beans
she
was
a
poor
misshapen
child
of
misfortune
with
a
sad
mark
of
suffering
upon
her
face
which
when
the
woman
entered
deepened
take
this
child
catrina
put
it
away
anywhere
anywhere
out
of
sight
it
is
hateful
to
then
throwing
off
the
brown
cloak
and
rubbing
her
hands
she
drew
near
the
fire
adding
be
in
a
hurry
girl
give
me
my
supper
for
i
am
tired
and
the
young
girl
had
taken
the
little
one
and
laid
it
upon
the
bed
and
though
there
was
an
expression
of
surprise
upon
her
face
she
placed
the
supper
upon
the
table
without
speaking
then
placing
chairs
she
and
the
woman
sat
down
together
still
not
a
word
was
spoken
by
and
by
after
they
had
eaten
and
the
dishes
were
washed
the
hearth
swept
and
more
fagots
heaped
upon
the
fire
the
girl
pointed
to
the
sleeping
child
let
her
be
said
the
woman
crossly
i
can
not
support
you
in
idleness
go
shell
your
the
girl
placed
a
cup
of
milk
at
the
fire
sat
down
again
to
her
task
and
for
a
long
time
nothing
was
heard
but
the
crackling
pods
at
length
the
woman
spoke
it
is
little
use
in
talking
to
you
catrina
but
i
must
speak
sometimes
and
you
are
the
only
being
i
have
about
me
and
you
can
not
tell
what
i
say
you
can
not
remember
catrina
many
years
ago
i
was
beautiful
i
was
young
now
i
am
old
not
with
years
see
this
hair
once
so
glossy
look
at
she
caught
out
the
comb
with
an
angry
grasp
and
all
over
her
neck
and
shoulders
fell
the
heavy
tangles
of
long
gray
hair
i
was
young
beautiful
and
beloved
oh
it
seems
an
age
of
years
ago
i
have
been
so
wretched
since
that
child
s
father
caused
his
death
i
lived
god
knows
how
till
your
father
came
and
i
married
him
for
love
oh
no
for
the
poor
protection
that
woman
s
nature
craves
and
a
shelter
from
despair
but
even
this
failed
me
what
a
life
for
both
but
i
am
revenged
ha
ha
they
will
wait
long
for
their
pretty
darling
the
woman
laughed
wildly
and
such
a
look
of
hate
and
exultation
covered
her
face
that
in
the
fitful
was
almost
fiendish
catrina
dropped
her
hands
on
her
lap
and
shuddered
while
her
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
wretched
woman
with
a
kind
of
fascination
go
to
work
go
to
work
i
say
you
stupid
little
witch
what
are
you
staring
at
you
look
as
if
you
were
frightened
out
of
the
little
sense
you
again
the
woman
laughed
a
strange
laugh
that
grated
harshly
upon
the
ear
of
the
unfortunate
girl
tears
filled
her
eyes
but
still
no
reply
poor
child
she
had
never
spoken
one
word
in
her
short
but
sorrowful
life
she
was
only
the
poor
little
of
the
woman
and
since
the
death
of
her
father
she
had
been
unhappy
the
noise
had
awakened
the
little
one
and
opening
her
large
eyes
she
looked
around
first
with
wonder
and
then
with
fear
at
the
strange
place
and
strange
faces
before
her
the
woman
rose
and
took
her
in
her
arms
so
little
chick
you
are
awake
and
how
do
you
think
your
lady
mamma
feels
now
and
your
proud
papa
ha
ha
he
never
thought
how
i
felt
when
years
ago
he
brought
death
to
my
heart
nor
will
i
think
of
slowly
she
began
swaying
the
child
to
and
fro
talking
fiercely
all
the
while
the
tiny
lips
of
the
baby
quivered
as
for
a
moment
she
suppressed
her
cry
then
a
pitiful
wail
filled
the
cottage
catrina
was
preparing
the
bowl
of
bread
and
milk
and
as
she
approached
the
little
one
held
out
her
hands
and
when
catrina
took
her
she
hid
her
face
in
her
bosom
and
sobbed
softly
the
child
was
hungry
and
as
the
girl
offered
her
the
bread
and
milk
she
ate
it
eagerly
but
all
the
while
her
frightened
gaze
was
fixed
upon
the
face
of
the
woman
who
seemed
to
grow
uneasy
before
the
pitiful
terror
of
those
innocent
eyes
it
is
always
so
now
even
this
child
shrinks
from
me
and
i
don
t
mean
to
harm
her
she
has
her
bread
and
milk
here
if
it
is
not
in
a
silver
bowl
ah
my
heart
is
of
stone
now
of
stone
and
instinctively
she
folded
her
arms
over
her
bosom
and
rocking
herself
gazed
into
the
fire
as
though
she
were
reading
the
future
in
its
fitful
embers
no
wonder
that
the
child
used
only
to
tenderness
looked
fearfully
upon
that
pale
dark
face
grown
prematurely
old
her
hair
still
hung
over
her
shoulders
a
long
and
tangled
mass
all
its
purple
luster
all
its
beauty
gone
forever
there
was
a
strange
wild
look
about
the
eyes
and
under
them
a
dark
sunken
circle
far
into
the
night
she
sat
brooding
over
the
glowing
embers
till
they
were
turned
to
blackened
cinders
that
night
catrina
had
a
more
pleasant
dream
than
she
had
known
since
her
father
died
after
the
little
one
had
eaten
her
supper
catrina
undressed
her
and
wrapping
her
in
a
blanket
placed
her
in
her
own
bed
patting
her
caressingly
with
her
hand
till
she
fell
asleep
catrina
lay
down
beside
her
and
soon
she
dreamed
that
an
angel
came
to
the
cottage
and
changed
the
darkness
to
light
that
even
her
s
face
grew
gentle
and
tender
and
her
voice
soft
and
low
in
that
blessed
presence
her
own
weary
heart
grew
light
and
as
she
looked
fondly
at
this
angel
full
of
gratitude
for
her
happiness
she
saw
only
the
child
before
her
but
clearly
she
heard
these
words
in
the
tones
of
her
father
s
voice
saying
this
child
shall
be
the
angel
of
the
she
awoke
to
find
her
face
bathed
in
tears
and
kissed
the
baby
a
hundred
times
and
in
her
silence
prayed
god
to
bless
the
darling
already
the
joy
of
an
angel
s
presence
filled
her
heart
poor
little
catrina
she
was
only
a
child
of
ten
years
yet
her
face
looked
pinched
old
and
careworn
this
was
not
strange
for
the
work
of
the
cottage
fell
to
her
small
hands
and
there
was
no
one
to
say
you
have
done
well
my
little
she
could
not
remember
her
own
gentle
mother
nor
when
the
came
to
them
but
she
never
forgot
the
sad
face
of
the
dear
papa
when
he
used
to
put
his
hand
upon
her
tangled
hair
saying
catrina
you
will
miss
papa
no
one
else
but
my
poor
little
desolate
mia
mijita
then
he
would
turn
to
hide
the
tears
that
would
not
be
driven
back
in
those
days
of
illness
he
was
helpless
as
catrina
in
her
babyhood
one
day
when
the
had
been
gone
since
the
dawning
the
father
seemed
to
sleep
catrina
sat
very
silently
for
many
hours
for
young
as
she
was
she
did
not
wish
to
disturb
poor
sick
papa
when
sleeping
she
grew
very
weary
but
still
he
did
not
wake
so
she
ran
softly
to
the
bedside
and
looked
at
him
till
her
heart
grew
faint
he
lay
so
still
and
was
very
pale
and
when
she
climbed
up
and
laid
her
little
face
against
his
she
shuddered
and
wept
bitterly
it
was
so
very
cold
after
a
while
the
returned
soon
some
men
came
and
took
the
father
away
and
though
they
looked
very
rough
one
of
them
stopped
and
gave
her
a
tortilla
saying
poor
little
young
one
she
has
lost
her
best
as
soon
as
the
little
girl
could
do
any
thing
the
gave
her
plenty
of
work
thus
the
years
went
by
till
the
eve
of
the
of
corpus
christi
when
baby
gracia
was
brought
to
the
cottage
it
seemed
like
the
dawn
of
a
new
life
to
the
lonely
catrina
to
look
into
that
sweet
baby
face
and
when
the
little
one
learned
to
love
her
and
cry
for
her
though
she
found
her
task
much
heavier
her
heart
grew
so
light
that
her
little
hands
worked
wonders
the
woman
took
off
the
pretty
coral
necklace
and
sleeve
clasps
and
all
the
child
s
fine
clothes
and
placed
them
in
the
strong
oaken
chest
at
the
head
of
her
bed
little
gracia
was
dressed
in
clothes
coarse
as
catrina
s
but
still
she
grew
more
lovely
every
day
and
looked
like
a
little
princess
in
her
rags
even
the
seared
heart
of
the
woman
softened
to
the
winning
ways
of
the
pretty
child
though
sometimes
she
would
drive
her
away
exclaiming
go
go
from
me
i
hate
the
at
other
times
she
would
take
her
in
her
arms
saying
the
baby
is
not
to
blame
and
with
tears
dimming
her
eyes
cover
the
little
face
with
fond
caresses
thus
passed
five
long
years
at
the
cottage
catrina
had
grown
stronger
and
more
shapely
her
face
was
full
of
love
and
tenderness
though
exposure
had
made
her
skin
very
rough
and
brown
gracia
had
changed
from
babyhood
to
a
sportive
child
graceful
as
a
young
fawn
one
rainy
night
the
woman
came
home
very
late
leaning
heavily
upon
the
arm
of
an
old
indian
who
with
great
difficulty
supported
her
trembling
steps
she
was
very
ill
and
she
felt
the
cold
shadow
of
death
falling
upon
her
gracia
was
asleep
but
catrina
sat
by
the
fire
waiting
and
keeping
the
supper
hot
she
was
frightened
when
she
saw
the
pale
face
of
the
and
trembled
with
fear
as
she
helped
the
indian
to
lay
her
upon
the
bed
for
a
few
moments
the
sick
woman
was
silent
from
exhaustion
but
after
a
time
she
called
catrina
to
her
listen
to
me
catrina
for
my
time
is
growing
short
i
have
been
cruel
to
you
at
times
but
you
have
been
always
good
and
true
forgive
me
now
my
poor
catrina
as
you
pray
the
good
lord
to
forgive
here
the
woman
grew
so
faint
that
she
was
obliged
to
stop
speaking
and
catrina
wept
as
though
her
heart
would
break
poor
girl
she
had
been
hardly
used
but
she
knew
no
other
fate
and
though
she
did
not
love
the
as
she
did
the
little
gracia
it
seemed
very
desolate
to
sit
there
by
the
dying
woman
who
had
given
her
a
home
poor
though
it
was
she
pressed
the
cold
hand
to
her
lips
and
buried
her
head
in
the
oh
that
child
gasped
the
wretched
woman
catrina
i
have
no
time
to
lose
i
see
every
thing
so
differently
i
have
been
crazy
but
all
is
clear
now
catrina
when
you
think
of
me
remember
me
only
as
a
poor
suffering
woman
and
forgive
me
as
you
hope
for
god
s
mercy
but
the
child
in
that
trunk
you
will
find
her
clothes
and
papers
which
will
prove
her
birth
her
father
is
a
good
and
true
man
as
i
have
learned
this
day
my
life
s
great
wrong
came
from
another
s
hand
promise
me
catrina
that
you
will
never
rest
till
you
have
restored
her
to
her
home
and
the
parents
who
love
the
s
words
grew
fainter
but
her
eyes
full
of
the
brightness
of
expiring
fires
were
fixed
upon
catrina
who
reverently
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
bowed
her
head
in
solemn
acquiescence
catrina
she
continued
go
up
to
the
cañon
keeping
to
the
right
then
over
the
mountain
path
till
you
come
to
the
great
a
spasm
of
pain
convulsed
her
and
she
ceased
speaking
in
a
few
moments
it
passed
away
and
a
calm
happy
smile
settled
upon
her
face
i
repent
of
all
my
sins
i
forgive
even
the
murderer
of
him
who
was
dearer
than
my
life
now
may
god
have
mercy
upon
my
the
husky
voice
was
hushed
the
clasped
hands
relaxed
and
the
suffering
woman
was
dead
she
has
gone
to
the
land
of
the
great
spirit
and
he
has
blessed
her
said
the
indian
filled
with
amazement
to
see
the
troubled
face
grow
so
calm
in
death
they
buried
her
in
the
shadow
of
the
deep
cañon
and
the
children
were
left
alone
the
kind
indian
came
every
day
to
the
cottage
to
look
after
them
bringing
always
a
bag
of
tortillas
and
fruits
one
morning
about
a
week
after
the
death
of
the
he
found
catrina
and
gracia
just
leaving
the
cottage
as
he
gave
catrina
the
tortillas
she
shook
his
hand
long
and
kindly
and
the
tears
glistened
in
her
eyes
but
she
could
not
speak
to
tell
him
she
was
going
away
never
to
rest
until
she
had
led
gracia
back
to
her
home
for
many
days
the
indian
returned
with
his
bag
of
tortillas
and
went
sadly
away
for
the
cottage
was
alone
in
the
dusky
shadows
the
children
took
the
path
to
the
right
out
of
the
cañon
then
on
up
the
steep
mountain
way
catrina
carried
gracia
s
in
her
arms
and
a
large
bag
of
tortillas
for
she
had
eaten
sparingly
for
a
week
that
she
might
have
food
for
a
long
journey
after
awhile
gracia
became
weary
and
then
catrina
took
her
in
her
arms
though
they
seemed
full
but
the
willing
heart
found
a
ready
way
to
help
her
darling
at
last
they
reached
the
top
of
the
mountain
so
very
worn
and
weary
that
after
they
had
eaten
their
dinners
gracia
fell
heavily
upon
catrina
s
lap
but
she
could
no
longer
support
the
weight
of
the
child
so
folding
her
in
her
arms
they
lay
down
upon
the
soft
turf
together
and
slept
as
soundly
as
though
it
had
been
a
bed
of
down
the
shadows
were
growing
very
long
when
the
young
girls
awoke
and
all
the
west
was
glowing
with
fleecy
amber
clouds
the
sunset
in
the
clear
pure
atmosphere
of
the
mountains
seemed
so
much
more
rich
and
beautiful
than
in
the
dim
cañon
that
little
gracia
s
eyes
shone
with
delight
oh
catrina
she
exclaimed
surely
that
is
the
glorious
heaven
we
see
before
us
do
you
not
remember
what
the
good
padre
told
us
when
he
came
to
the
cottage
let
us
hurry
catrina
tis
not
so
very
far
perhaps
we
can
get
there
before
catrina
caught
the
hand
of
the
excited
child
and
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
knelt
down
with
her
face
toward
the
sunset
and
prayed
for
the
soul
of
the
unhappy
for
the
little
gracia
whom
she
loved
dearly
and
last
of
all
for
herself
the
radiance
of
the
sunset
fell
upon
the
poor
dumb
girl
and
shed
its
shining
beauty
upon
her
face
when
catrina
arose
gracia
looked
at
her
with
eyes
full
of
eager
wonder
how
god
loves
you
catrina
she
whispered
he
threw
his
glory
all
around
you
when
you
catrina
smiled
and
kissed
the
child
and
giving
her
a
tortilla
they
began
to
descend
the
mountain
but
the
twilight
came
on
so
fast
that
very
soon
they
could
hardly
see
their
way
gracia
clasped
catrina
s
hand
very
closely
saying
i
should
be
afraid
in
the
dark
only
god
loves
you
so
much
and
heaven
is
so
thus
they
went
on
as
long
as
they
could
see
and
then
sat
down
in
the
darkness
and
by
and
by
slept
again
catrina
woke
early
in
the
morning
and
seeing
a
not
far
distant
covered
with
fruit
left
gracia
sleeping
and
ran
to
gather
some
it
will
be
so
nice
with
our
dry
tortillas
she
thought
and
dear
gracia
will
be
pleased
with
the
juicy
she
made
great
haste
fearing
lest
the
child
might
wake
and
be
frightened
at
her
absence
and
in
a
short
time
she
returned
with
her
apron
filled
with
the
delicious
fruit
her
face
lighted
with
the
smile
of
grateful
love
as
she
saw
the
little
girl
still
sleeping
sweetly
a
moment
more
and
the
happy
smile
was
turned
to
an
expression
of
intense
horror
only
a
few
feet
from
the
child
crouched
the
huge
form
of
an
immense
cougar
his
fierce
eyes
gloating
with
hungry
fire
upon
his
helpless
prey
catrina
remained
transfixed
for
a
moment
watching
the
wild
beast
until
he
crouched
to
spring
upon
her
darling
she
then
threw
her
arms
over
her
head
rushed
forward
and
by
what
means
god
knows
her
intense
terror
burst
the
of
sound
and
the
dumb
girl
gave
one
wild
shrill
cry
that
made
the
mountains
echo
just
at
that
moment
came
a
sharp
flash
of
light
and
the
cougar
lay
weltering
in
his
blood
the
startled
gracia
woke
to
find
catrina
lying
as
one
dead
upon
the
ground
and
a
handsome
young
boy
coming
forward
to
help
them
the
little
girl
was
much
frightened
and
weeping
bitterly
she
threw
her
arms
around
catrina
and
called
piteously
oh
catrina
catrina
open
your
eyes
do
not
leave
me
catrina
god
loves
you
he
has
called
you
then
catrina
opened
her
eyes
and
said
with
imperfect
utterance
don
t
cry
my
darling
the
cougar
is
dead
don
t
cry
he
will
not
hurt
and
she
kissed
gracia
and
cried
as
hard
as
the
child
you
catrina
you
speak
exclaimed
little
gracia
as
soon
as
she
could
speak
for
catrina
s
caresses
you
speak
who
never
spoke
in
your
life
the
good
god
heard
your
prayer
last
night
he
shed
his
glory
upon
you
and
now
you
they
embraced
each
other
and
wept
for
joy
then
they
noticed
the
handsome
boy
standing
near
them
resting
upon
his
gun
and
catrina
pressed
his
hand
to
her
lips
and
thanked
him
again
and
again
they
all
went
to
look
at
the
cougar
together
and
catrina
told
the
wondering
gracia
how
very
near
to
heaven
she
had
been
and
young
leon
de
lande
told
them
both
how
he
had
started
by
moonlight
to
hunt
in
the
mountains
and
how
he
thanked
god
he
had
been
able
to
save
the
little
señorita
they
sat
down
to
eat
their
tortillas
and
fruit
and
then
started
for
the
valley
poor
catrina
how
delightful
to
be
able
to
talk
though
she
needed
practice
to
be
able
to
speak
plainly
she
was
like
a
little
child
just
learning
but
she
managed
to
let
leon
know
all
about
gracia
and
he
with
delighted
surprise
told
her
that
he
knew
her
father
who
was
the
richest
señor
in
all
the
country
and
that
in
a
few
hours
they
could
reach
the
vineyard
never
were
there
happier
young
people
than
went
down
the
mountain
together
as
they
entered
the
wood
whom
should
they
meet
but
poor
old
nurse
macata
hunting
for
her
lost
darling
i
have
found
the
little
señorita
for
you
good
macata
said
leon
macata
gave
one
glance
at
gracia
then
caught
her
in
her
arms
exclaiming
mia
ninita
mia
waconda
the
master
of
life
has
heard
my
cry
i
knew
you
were
not
lost
for
the
old
indian
started
off
at
full
speed
carrying
gracia
in
her
arms
sobbing
all
the
time
and
blessing
the
great
spirit
that
she
had
lived
to
restore
the
lost
child
to
the
dear
señora
leon
and
catrina
could
barely
keep
pace
with
her
but
at
last
they
entered
the
very
room
where
five
years
before
the
beautiful
child
lay
sleeping
in
her
little
willow
cradle
i
have
brought
her
back
señora
cried
old
macata
out
of
breath
it
is
our
little
white
bud
señora
dear
oh
mia
mijita
waconda
has
not
forgotten
us
the
old
woman
placed
the
child
in
the
mother
s
arms
and
fell
with
her
face
upon
the
floor
weeping
for
joy
no
words
can
tell
the
joy
that
filled
the
house
only
the
heart
of
the
father
and
mother
could
feel
how
greatly
god
had
blessed
them
now
the
years
went
pleasantly
by
the
good
catrina
become
a
lovely
maiden
her
form
gained
strength
and
beauty
her
hair
grew
soft
and
glossy
her
skin
clear
and
smooth
and
her
brown
eyes
were
tender
with
the
light
of
happiness
but
most
wonderful
of
all
her
voice
was
a
marvel
of
sweetness
it
was
a
great
pleasure
to
hear
her
sing
at
evening
accompanied
by
the
soft
music
of
her
light
guitar
she
was
loved
by
all
but
especially
so
by
the
young
hidalgo
who
won
her
for
his
bride
leon
and
gracia
danced
together
at
the
wedding
and
it
was
plain
enough
to
see
how
devoted
the
brave
young
señor
was
to
the
graceful
señorita
whose
life
he
had
saved
gracia
had
grown
more
and
more
beautiful
every
year
till
in
all
the
country
she
was
called
she
had
many
admirers
but
the
señor
said
young
leon
restored
her
to
us
and
to
him
only
will
we
give
our
thus
upon
her
sixteenth
birthday
the
great
wedding
feast
was
made
and
all
san
diego
around
the
great
joy
there
were
tables
spread
under
the
for
the
poor
and
all
the
country
was
there
in
the
quaint
adobe
church
the
marriage
ceremony
was
performed
and
with
a
happy
heart
leon
received
his
bride
while
the
father
and
mother
thanked
god
for
his
most
blessed
gifts
their
son
and
daughter
thus
all
their
sorrows
ended
and
all
their
lives
were
circled
by
the
light
of
happiness
and
love
the
dancing
sunbeam
in
a
dark
narrow
street
of
the
city
stood
a
dingy
tenement
house
many
people
lived
within
and
called
it
by
the
dear
name
of
home
yet
it
was
very
different
from
the
luxurious
homes
of
the
rich
surrounded
by
pleasant
gardens
filled
with
costly
pictures
and
a
thousand
beautiful
things
very
delightful
to
possess
nor
was
it
like
the
comfortable
homes
of
the
middle
class
where
the
fire
burns
brightly
in
the
polished
grate
and
the
table
is
always
plentifully
spread
oh
no
the
people
in
the
tenement
house
were
all
poor
from
the
first
floor
front
to
the
attic
back
which
was
the
worst
of
all
it
was
the
rainy
season
and
through
the
roof
round
the
chimney
and
between
the
cracked
and
loosened
came
the
driving
rain
then
there
was
a
continual
opening
and
shutting
of
doors
and
at
the
common
entrance
all
day
long
and
far
into
the
night
there
was
somebody
always
coming
in
or
going
out
letting
in
the
chilling
blast
that
rushed
through
the
muddy
halls
and
into
the
rooms
pinching
the
sick
and
old
in
a
pitiless
way
altogether
it
was
not
a
pleasant
place
to
live
in
but
most
of
the
people
in
the
tenement
house
had
always
been
poor
and
had
learned
to
be
content
with
what
the
day
brought
them
so
they
were
not
hungry
only
one
in
the
house
had
known
the
luxury
of
being
very
rich
and
she
was
now
the
poorest
of
them
all
just
under
the
roof
she
sat
wearily
stitching
upon
the
coarse
work
that
must
bring
bread
to
her
little
child
how
the
rain
pattered
and
clattered
upon
the
roof
as
the
woman
bent
above
her
unaccustomed
task
thinking
over
the
old
thoughts
that
made
the
present
more
than
desolate
it
was
not
so
once
said
the
rain
the
old
home
how
comfortable
and
beautiful
it
was
there
you
were
a
fair
lady
with
hands
now
you
are
the
same
only
one
can
not
think
so
there
are
silver
threads
in
your
hair
and
your
hands
are
too
red
people
say
what
a
pity
the
woman
with
the
pretty
child
is
so
poor
but
they
do
not
help
the
old
home
the
old
home
echoed
the
sad
thoughts
all
day
long
and
into
the
still
hours
of
the
night
in
the
corner
of
the
room
sat
a
little
child
playing
with
a
doll
made
of
an
old
apron
yet
to
the
child
it
was
the
pretty
she
was
very
beautiful
with
silken
white
hair
shimmered
over
with
a
golden
luster
a
little
garden
flower
thrown
out
by
chance
upon
the
common
wayside
yet
blossoming
in
her
own
sweet
beauty
in
contrast
with
every
thing
around
her
she
was
a
real
princess
born
and
her
coarse
ragged
clothes
could
make
no
difference
the
work
was
finished
and
though
it
was
raining
still
the
mother
put
on
her
worn
bonnet
to
take
it
home
if
the
sun
would
only
shine
again
she
sighed
heavily
looking
down
into
the
dismal
back
alley
but
i
must
she
kissed
the
child
saying
be
good
darling
mamma
will
not
be
gone
i
will
be
good
mamma
she
answered
and
dolladine
and
i
will
catch
the
sunshine
for
you
are
my
only
sunshine
now
said
the
mother
hastening
away
to
conceal
the
tears
that
would
not
stay
in
their
then
the
little
one
was
left
alone
in
the
and
began
as
she
often
did
to
talk
to
her
doll
now
dolladine
she
said
mamma
is
very
sad
and
sick
i
fear
and
you
and
i
must
make
sunshine
for
her
but
how
shall
we
do
it
that
is
the
question
don
t
you
remember
dolladine
one
day
the
pretty
lady
said
my
hair
was
beaming
sunshine
we
must
shake
it
out
for
poor
mamma
we
must
shake
it
out
and
the
little
girl
began
jumping
around
the
room
shaking
her
curls
and
singing
we
will
make
the
bright
sunshine
dolladine
dolladine
make
for
mamma
glad
sunshine
dolladine
just
then
she
saw
the
sunbeams
dancing
into
the
room
the
rain
was
over
and
on
the
roof
of
the
next
house
a
washerwoman
was
hanging
out
her
clothes
which
were
blowing
about
in
the
wind
casting
gleams
of
light
and
shadow
upon
the
little
attic
window
so
that
the
sunshine
went
flitting
about
like
the
for
the
shadow
was
always
chasing
it
the
child
was
delighted
do
you
see
it
dolladine
she
said
the
glorious
sunshine
which
the
loving
god
gives
us
now
we
must
catch
it
for
she
took
the
doll
in
her
arms
and
gave
chase
to
the
dancing
phantom
but
it
was
no
use
just
as
her
little
hand
was
ready
to
grasp
it
it
flew
away
you
don
t
help
me
enough
dolladine
said
the
child
her
little
eyes
filling
with
tears
just
then
a
great
came
at
the
door
and
before
she
could
answer
it
in
walked
a
little
old
man
with
a
very
wrinkled
face
and
long
white
beard
a
big
hat
almost
covered
his
face
so
that
the
upper
part
was
all
in
shadow
what
are
you
doing
little
chick
he
said
pleasantly
and
where
is
the
mother
mamma
has
gone
to
carry
home
the
work
answered
the
child
timidly
and
dolladine
and
i
have
been
making
sunshine
for
her
but
see
it
flies
away
and
again
she
tried
to
catch
the
dancing
beams
it
often
does
from
older
and
wiser
hands
than
yours
but
how
did
you
make
it
fairy
asked
the
old
man
laughing
god
put
it
in
my
hair
and
i
shook
it
out
for
dear
mamma
who
is
sick
and
so
tired
of
the
dark
days
replied
the
little
one
again
shaking
her
pretty
curls
that
were
luminous
with
beauty
i
see
said
the
old
man
now
i
am
a
great
magician
and
can
help
you
and
he
sang
with
a
clear
ringing
voice
sunshine
sunshine
flitting
and
airy
dwell
in
the
heart
of
the
little
fairy
make
her
gentle
loving
and
mild
make
her
the
mother
s
sunshine
just
at
that
moment
the
washerwoman
took
down
a
big
sheet
and
the
little
room
was
flooded
with
warm
glowing
sunshine
oh
it
is
glorious
is
it
not
dolladine
exclaimed
the
child
clapping
her
hands
and
dancing
about
with
pleasure
mamma
will
be
so
happy
and
so
will
dolladine
and
remember
said
the
old
magician
that
all
good
comes
from
the
loving
god
who
has
blessed
you
and
made
you
the
sunshine
child
you
can
make
the
mother
and
every
one
very
happy
so
long
as
you
keep
god
s
sunshine
in
your
heart
but
if
you
forget
the
blessed
christ
it
will
fly
away
and
will
not
be
the
warm
beautiful
light
of
god
s
love
but
only
the
dancing
sunshine
that
always
escapes
your
grasp
and
then
how
sad
you
would
change
to
the
little
child
which
would
be
worse
than
the
darkest
winter
s
day
to
the
dear
oh
no
no
i
will
never
forget
to
bless
the
good
god
it
is
so
delightful
to
make
mamma
and
every
one
this
box
said
the
old
man
is
full
of
sunshine
i
will
give
it
you
for
the
let
me
kiss
you
dear
magician
said
the
child
gently
i
always
love
anybody
who
is
kind
to
poor
the
old
man
took
the
little
one
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
fondly
saying
god
bless
you
darling
god
bless
you
then
he
went
away
to
be
her
friend
i
am
so
happy
i
can
not
keep
still
dolladine
said
the
child
and
she
danced
about
till
the
mother
came
in
weary
and
worn
oh
mamma
said
she
running
up
and
kissing
her
we
shall
always
be
happy
now
in
god
s
glorious
sunshine
and
the
old
magician
gave
me
this
box
full
of
it
for
you
it
was
some
time
before
the
mother
could
understand
all
but
when
she
opened
the
box
sure
enough
it
was
full
of
sunshine
there
was
the
missing
deed
that
restored
to
her
her
own
the
dear
old
home
and
all
her
great
wealth
again
she
became
the
fair
lady
with
the
hands
but
her
greatest
joy
was
in
the
warm
genial
sunshine
her
good
little
daughter
made
from
a
child
she
grew
up
to
be
a
loving
beautiful
and
pure
woman
but
she
never
forgot
the
good
god
and
all
her
life
remained
the
mother
s
sunshine
child
the
young
in
the
olden
time
between
the
mission
of
san
gabriel
and
los
angeles
lived
an
old
spaniard
his
wife
and
one
son
in
his
early
manhood
don
pedro
had
been
very
rich
but
sickness
and
misfortune
had
followed
him
until
in
his
old
age
he
was
destitute
of
many
of
the
comforts
of
life
sorrowful
and
dispirited
he
looked
forward
to
death
as
the
only
portal
of
hope
for
future
repose
francisco
his
son
was
full
of
youthful
ambition
and
ardent
life
one
morning
he
went
to
the
bedside
of
his
father
and
mother
and
kneeling
down
beside
them
begged
their
blessing
i
am
going
he
said
dear
father
and
mother
to
retrieve
your
fallen
the
father
blessed
him
and
bade
him
godspeed
but
the
mother
wept
and
clasped
her
arms
about
him
till
her
silver
hair
mingled
with
the
glossy
black
of
his
and
when
he
tore
himself
regretfully
from
her
embrace
she
called
him
again
and
again
to
return
for
one
more
kiss
at
last
when
he
rushed
out
and
was
nearly
gone
from
her
she
buried
her
head
in
the
and
sobbed
as
if
her
heart
would
break
francisco
was
at
first
greatly
saddened
and
subdued
by
his
dear
mother
s
grief
but
soon
with
the
fresh
morning
air
the
elastic
spirits
of
youth
rose
joyous
and
hopeful
and
he
sung
merrily
as
he
wandered
on
through
the
open
country
he
had
taken
with
him
some
tortillas
coarse
cakes
and
dried
beef
when
he
was
hungry
he
sat
down
in
the
shade
ate
sparingly
of
these
and
of
the
delicious
fruits
that
abound
through
all
the
country
and
drank
from
the
clear
spring
thus
passed
the
first
few
days
of
his
journeying
but
there
came
a
time
when
out
in
the
desert
his
food
became
exhausted
and
there
were
no
cooling
springs
bubbling
up
from
the
yellow
heat
of
the
burning
sand
there
were
no
trees
no
fruit
no
shade
he
wandered
on
for
two
days
and
nights
until
nature
was
almost
exhausted
and
when
the
third
night
came
he
threw
himself
upon
the
sand
to
die
he
prayed
devoutly
to
the
holy
virgin
to
intercede
for
his
soul
and
grant
his
fevered
body
rest
when
as
he
turned
his
head
wearily
far
out
on
the
desert
gleamed
a
light
hope
rose
in
his
bosom
and
he
drew
his
aching
limbs
onward
till
nearer
and
nearer
gleamed
the
blessed
light
from
a
cool
oasis
in
the
desert
soon
his
foot
pressed
the
soft
turf
and
green
trees
waved
above
his
head
the
blessed
virgin
had
pitied
him
and
listened
to
his
prayer
he
was
saved
he
thought
the
waters
of
the
running
stream
the
sweetest
music
he
had
ever
beard
and
bending
over
with
his
hand
he
raised
to
his
parched
lips
a
draught
of
holy
water
for
twas
the
mother
of
mercy
s
gift
the
gift
of
life
extreme
thirst
is
the
most
intolerable
of
all
sufferings
greater
far
than
hunger
none
but
those
who
have
endured
its
pangs
can
have
the
least
idea
of
the
excruciating
pain
it
brings
after
francisco
had
drank
the
water
he
was
for
a
time
very
sick
but
soon
was
sufficiently
relieved
to
long
for
food
and
rest
so
again
he
looked
for
the
light
that
had
guided
him
to
the
oasis
just
before
him
from
the
thicket
of
it
gleamed
he
drew
near
cautiously
fearing
it
might
prove
the
encampment
of
hostile
indians
softly
as
he
stepped
the
quick
ear
of
an
old
indian
woman
detected
his
approach
and
she
raised
her
eyes
to
meet
his
eager
and
hungry
gaze
as
he
looked
longingly
at
the
supper
she
was
preparing
over
the
fire
just
outside
her
little
cane
hut
when
he
saw
that
he
was
discovered
he
went
up
to
her
holding
out
his
hand
and
saying
good
mother
i
am
very
hungry
and
weary
give
me
something
to
eat
and
let
me
rest
here
or
i
shall
die
oh
mother
mother
he
was
thinking
of
his
own
mother
at
home
but
his
words
and
tones
sunk
into
the
heart
of
the
old
indian
woman
and
tears
gathered
in
her
dim
eyes
as
she
placed
her
hand
softly
on
francisco
s
shoulders
you
call
me
mother
she
said
in
spanish
sadly
those
who
used
to
call
me
mother
are
all
dead
my
boy
would
have
been
like
you
my
brave
boy
my
timid
girl
gone
all
gone
she
wept
bitterly
as
she
gave
francisco
the
choicest
morsels
and
a
cool
delicious
drink
that
was
a
balm
to
his
parched
and
aching
throat
when
francisco
had
eaten
he
was
overcome
with
fatigue
and
want
of
sleep
but
when
he
would
have
thrown
himself
down
upon
a
mat
in
the
hut
and
fallen
asleep
immediately
the
old
mother
caught
him
by
the
arm
exclaiming
you
must
not
lie
down
there
to
sleep
you
would
never
wake
again
for
when
the
chief
my
husband
returns
he
would
kill
you
for
he
hates
the
spaniards
what
can
i
do
with
you
my
poor
boy
i
can
go
no
farther
mother
i
shall
die
of
fatigue
if
i
try
think
of
the
two
days
and
nights
i
passed
upon
the
desert
without
food
drink
or
and
he
threw
himself
in
the
corner
saying
he
must
kill
me
if
he
will
and
in
a
moment
was
fast
asleep
the
old
woman
bent
over
and
kissed
him
weeping
he
called
me
mother
she
said
poor
boy
poor
she
covered
him
over
with
cool
boughs
with
the
thick
green
leaves
still
fresh
upon
them
how
long
he
slept
he
could
not
tell
but
while
it
was
yet
dark
a
rough
voice
very
near
awoke
him
opening
his
eyes
and
peering
through
the
mass
of
foliage
he
saw
a
gigantic
indian
surrounded
by
half
a
dozen
younger
men
all
eating
what
appeared
to
be
an
early
breakfast
and
talking
over
some
adventure
in
which
they
were
about
engaging
from
their
conversation
he
learned
that
he
was
approaching
the
borders
of
the
rich
arizona
country
and
he
noticed
when
the
chief
put
up
his
ammunition
he
was
the
only
one
who
carried
a
gun
that
the
bullet
was
of
pure
gold
he
lay
for
some
time
motionless
carefully
watching
their
movements
at
one
time
he
came
very
near
being
discovered
one
of
the
young
indians
had
mislaid
his
bow
and
arrow
and
went
to
the
pile
of
brush
to
look
for
it
but
the
old
woman
whose
mother
s
heart
had
warmed
to
the
perishing
young
stranger
drove
the
indian
boy
away
with
a
sharp
reproof
for
his
carelessness
in
disturbing
her
basket
of
reeds
which
were
mingled
with
the
concealing
boughs
at
last
the
missing
bow
was
found
and
the
company
mounted
and
rode
away
again
silence
fell
upon
the
hut
still
weary
francisco
lay
quietly
watching
the
old
woman
as
she
moved
about
with
a
lighted
taper
silently
putting
the
things
to
rights
but
at
last
she
blew
out
the
light
and
lay
down
to
rest
upon
a
mat
near
the
door
and
in
the
darkness
the
green
oasis
of
the
desert
faded
into
the
land
of
dreams
the
morning
sun
was
shining
clear
and
bright
through
the
waving
branches
of
the
when
francisco
again
awoke
there
was
no
one
in
the
hut
when
he
arose
and
went
to
the
spring
where
the
night
before
he
had
slaked
his
thirst
again
he
drank
from
its
pure
fountain
bathing
his
face
and
neck
in
the
sparkling
water
till
he
felt
quite
refreshed
above
his
head
amid
the
glossy
leaves
hung
the
rich
yellow
bananas
he
gathered
some
and
ate
them
as
he
returned
to
the
hut
with
a
hopeful
happy
heart
the
old
mother
met
him
at
the
door
and
greeted
him
pleasantly
they
sat
down
together
and
ate
their
morning
meal
francisco
told
her
how
he
had
left
home
to
seek
his
fortune
and
of
his
father
and
mother
who
had
once
been
very
rich
and
had
become
poor
and
in
their
old
age
were
suffering
for
the
comforts
of
life
how
he
had
vowed
if
his
life
was
spared
that
they
should
enjoy
all
that
money
and
love
could
provide
for
them
and
now
mother
he
said
i
am
seeking
gold
and
gold
i
must
have
if
my
life
pays
the
were
it
not
that
the
chieftain
my
husband
would
kill
you
i
could
show
you
where
gold
is
plenty
enough
said
the
old
woman
only
one
day
s
journey
from
here
are
the
great
mines
and
even
on
the
ground
you
can
pick
up
quite
large
nuggets
of
almost
pure
gold
but
every
hour
you
stay
here
your
life
is
in
danger
and
you
must
live
to
be
happy
there
are
places
in
the
arizona
country
where
the
ground
is
yellow
with
gold
the
indians
care
little
for
it
but
you
could
never
go
there
and
return
alive
at
every
step
your
way
would
be
beset
with
a
more
deadly
foe
than
the
hunger
and
thirst
of
the
desert
boy
you
have
wakened
a
love
that
was
dead
in
my
heart
i
will
save
you
if
possible
and
as
nearly
as
i
can
will
grant
your
then
the
old
woman
prepared
food
and
water
for
a
journey
and
taking
two
bags
she
filled
them
with
great
nuggets
of
pure
gold
and
laid
across
the
back
of
a
strong
mule
as
much
as
he
could
carry
and
embracing
francisco
she
bade
him
take
the
mule
and
recross
the
desert
with
all
possible
dispatch
our
men
will
return
and
you
must
be
far
then
she
gave
him
directions
about
the
way
by
if
you
keep
the
trail
you
will
reach
green
trees
and
water
go
home
now
be
rich
and
happy
but
some
times
remember
the
lonely
indian
mother
far
away
in
the
old
woman
embraced
him
again
weeping
and
said
all
who
call
me
mother
must
go
from
francisco
kissed
her
brown
cheek
and
went
out
from
under
the
shade
of
the
into
the
arid
waste
looking
back
as
long
as
he
could
see
over
the
desert
in
the
distance
he
saw
the
old
woman
watching
him
she
too
had
gone
out
from
the
shadow
of
the
and
stood
upon
the
burning
sand
shading
her
tearful
eyes
with
her
wrinkled
hand
from
the
blinding
sunshine
god
pity
the
childless
mother
francisco
was
fortunate
in
keeping
the
trail
and
at
night
reached
the
trees
and
water
the
old
woman
had
spoken
of
but
the
desert
was
still
before
him
a
long
and
toilsome
journey
for
six
weary
days
he
traveled
through
an
arid
sandy
waste
finding
water
at
intervals
and
when
at
last
the
green
hills
of
san
gabriel
rose
before
him
he
wept
like
a
child
for
joy
but
he
soon
called
back
his
manhood
and
laughed
at
his
weakness
with
a
full
happy
heart
he
journeyed
on
till
los
angeles
dear
los
angeles
the
home
of
his
infancy
lay
before
him
there
was
the
cottage
of
his
mother
and
she
herself
standing
at
the
door
he
had
returned
after
all
his
hardships
strong
rich
and
happy
again
the
gray
hair
of
his
mother
rested
on
his
shoulder
but
this
time
she
wept
tears
of
joy
as
he
whispered
in
her
ear
mother
dear
you
and
father
can
never
want
again
i
am
rich
now
i
have
gold
enough
to
last
a
lifetime
and
mother
you
shall
have
a
beautiful
home
and
i
will
ask
juanita
who
loves
you
to
come
and
be
your
daughter
and
my
the
through
the
branches
of
a
great
sported
the
golden
sunlight
till
it
fell
in
shining
flecks
upon
the
broad
verandas
of
a
spacious
adobe
house
nothing
could
be
pleasanter
than
this
homestead
in
the
southern
gold
land
with
the
great
garden
around
it
filled
with
all
kinds
of
tropical
flowers
and
fruits
in
their
season
here
dwelt
a
little
boy
and
girl
whose
father
and
mother
were
both
dead
so
they
poor
children
had
their
sorrows
after
the
mother
died
the
father
had
married
a
poor
widow
who
had
two
children
about
the
age
of
his
own
little
ones
at
first
while
the
comfort
of
the
new
home
was
a
novelty
to
the
woman
she
had
been
kind
to
the
children
but
as
the
strangeness
wore
off
she
began
to
feel
like
the
real
mistress
in
a
thousand
ways
she
favored
her
own
children
who
were
proud
and
selfish
and
in
all
their
childish
differences
only
the
motherless
ones
were
punished
then
the
father
died
and
the
became
like
a
great
shadow
between
them
and
the
bright
sunshine
of
childhood
she
would
have
sent
them
away
from
home
but
their
own
mother
had
been
very
rich
and
after
the
father
s
death
the
house
in
which
they
lived
the
vineyard
and
the
large
herd
of
cattle
feeding
upon
the
hills
all
belonged
to
them
the
was
very
angry
at
this
but
she
was
their
guardian
so
she
managed
every
thing
to
suit
herself
and
lived
in
great
ease
and
luxury
one
day
as
the
children
were
playing
in
the
garden
the
s
son
threw
his
ball
into
a
that
was
covered
with
thorns
go
and
get
it
for
me
zoie
said
he
sharply
to
the
little
girl
i
can
not
replied
the
child
for
the
thorns
will
tear
my
dress
and
the
señora
will
whip
how
dare
you
call
my
mother
the
señora
it
is
not
from
respect
but
because
you
are
a
hateful
little
and
he
struck
the
child
a
cruel
blow
and
made
her
go
for
the
ball
her
dress
was
torn
and
her
pretty
hands
bleeding
when
she
recovered
it
just
then
her
own
brother
came
up
and
would
have
fought
the
unkind
boy
but
the
little
zoie
entreated
weeping
dear
brother
do
not
strike
him
come
with
me
while
i
say
forgive
us
our
trespasses
as
we
forgive
those
who
trespass
against
the
heart
of
the
young
boy
swelled
with
anger
and
his
quickened
pulse
beat
fearfully
but
because
he
loved
his
sister
he
suffered
her
to
lead
him
away
for
well
he
knew
nothing
would
grieve
her
so
much
as
his
returning
blow
for
blow
oh
to
be
a
man
he
thought
as
the
hot
tears
filled
his
eyes
why
don
t
the
years
fly
fast
how
long
must
i
wait
before
i
can
take
care
of
my
little
sister
like
a
man
already
the
manhood
was
dawning
in
his
heart
and
if
he
could
have
protected
the
dear
little
maiden
he
would
have
dared
any
thing
at
this
moment
the
garden
gate
opened
and
an
old
indian
woman
came
up
the
walk
crying
strawberries
fresh
and
ripe
red
and
bright
strawberries
strawberries
all
the
children
ran
to
meet
her
and
looked
so
eagerly
at
the
pretty
crimson
fruit
that
she
gave
to
each
of
them
a
handful
but
to
the
little
sister
who
was
so
modest
and
beautiful
she
gave
a
small
basket
covered
with
green
leaves
and
filled
with
the
delicious
berries
when
the
other
children
would
have
taken
the
basket
for
themselves
the
old
woman
prevented
them
and
while
they
went
crying
to
their
mother
zoie
hid
her
treasure
under
the
trailing
vines
of
a
be
quick
little
señorita
said
the
old
indian
your
mother
once
saved
the
life
of
my
child
and
an
indian
never
forgets
in
the
basket
is
a
wonderful
talisman
which
will
give
you
any
thing
you
want
just
for
the
she
had
hardly
time
to
say
this
when
the
came
out
and
bought
all
the
fruit
she
had
left
the
señora
was
very
angry
with
the
orphans
and
after
whipping
them
both
for
quarreling
sent
them
supperless
to
bed
in
an
old
where
the
indian
servants
slept
but
she
and
her
children
sat
down
to
a
luxurious
meal
with
a
large
basket
of
delicious
strawberries
in
the
center
of
the
table
plenty
of
nice
white
sugar
and
three
bowls
of
fresh
rich
cream
for
some
time
the
lonely
orphans
lay
talking
of
their
own
dear
parents
and
weeping
as
they
lay
shivering
in
each
other
s
arms
the
evening
was
coming
on
and
though
the
days
were
very
warm
there
was
a
chill
in
the
damp
night
air
and
they
had
only
a
thin
sheet
to
cover
them
at
last
the
brother
said
sister
i
can
not
endure
it
if
they
would
only
whip
me
but
to
see
them
strike
you
i
can
not
endure
it
you
whom
i
promised
the
dear
papa
to
love
and
protect
we
have
nothing
but
sorrow
here
let
us
go
out
into
the
wide
world
alone
it
will
not
be
so
bad
at
least
we
shall
be
away
from
the
señora
who
gives
only
hard
crusts
to
dear
brother
let
us
go
the
good
god
who
takes
care
of
the
pretty
birds
will
take
care
of
us
but
first
bring
me
my
blue
shawl
for
it
was
the
last
thing
the
dear
mamma
gave
very
softly
the
boy
rose
and
went
for
the
shawl
but
the
old
indian
cook
who
had
lived
in
the
family
before
he
was
born
and
loved
the
children
dearly
saw
him
and
gave
him
some
tortillas
the
old
wizzen
witch
to
treat
the
real
señora
s
children
so
said
the
woman
angrily
she
the
señora
to
be
sure
a
cane
hut
in
the
chaparral
would
be
good
enough
for
mammie
said
the
boy
throwing
his
arms
around
the
old
indian
s
neck
we
are
going
away
to
seek
our
fortune
and
when
i
am
a
man
you
shall
live
with
us
but
do
not
follow
us
now
or
she
will
see
you
we
are
running
away
from
the
señora
he
whispered
softly
the
old
indian
pressed
him
to
her
heart
for
a
moment
and
then
said
go
for
nothing
in
the
wild
woods
will
hurt
you
so
much
as
staying
here
i
shall
go
but
i
must
wait
and
see
that
the
old
witch
does
not
bring
you
back
for
i
believe
she
would
kill
you
only
for
then
the
boy
went
softly
out
and
the
old
indian
covered
her
face
with
her
apron
and
thought
over
her
half
savage
thoughts
which
were
still
full
of
good
faith
and
love
to
the
children
who
had
slept
in
her
bosom
in
their
helpless
infancy
the
little
zoie
was
waiting
for
her
brother
in
the
garden
as
soon
as
she
saw
him
she
held
up
the
basket
of
strawberries
saying
this
is
all
we
have
but
no
doubt
in
the
wide
world
god
will
give
us
all
we
the
young
boy
wrapped
the
shawl
about
her
and
clasping
each
other
s
hands
they
stole
out
of
the
garden
silently
but
when
the
gate
had
closed
upon
them
he
told
her
how
the
old
cook
had
given
them
the
tortillas
that
is
but
the
beginning
of
our
good
fortune
answered
the
child
as
they
passed
the
lake
of
the
tuleis
the
moon
and
stars
were
shining
pleasantly
casting
a
flood
of
soft
golden
light
upon
the
graves
of
the
father
and
mother
here
the
children
stopped
for
a
moment
and
the
little
maiden
laid
her
head
upon
the
green
grave
of
the
mother
crying
oh
mamma
mamma
we
loved
you
so
dearly
and
are
so
lonely
now
we
are
going
out
into
the
wide
world
alone
mamma
dear
sweet
mamma
she
buried
her
head
in
the
long
grass
and
there
would
have
wept
herself
to
sleep
as
she
had
often
done
before
but
the
brother
took
her
by
the
hand
saying
we
must
hasten
sister
or
the
señora
will
come
after
so
they
ran
on
as
fast
as
they
could
and
every
waving
shrub
or
tree
their
fear
and
the
darkness
changed
into
the
form
of
the
angry
at
last
they
came
to
a
thick
wood
and
began
to
feel
quite
safe
as
they
entered
it
it
seemed
so
large
and
so
far
out
into
the
wide
world
that
they
were
sure
the
could
never
find
them
there
the
gray
twilight
of
the
morning
was
coming
on
and
as
they
were
very
tired
and
hungry
they
sat
down
under
the
trees
to
eat
their
tortillas
and
strawberries
in
the
bottom
of
the
basket
zoie
found
a
nut
about
the
size
of
an
almond
this
must
be
the
talisman
that
makes
wishing
having
said
the
little
girl
they
wished
all
sorts
of
things
but
nothing
came
to
them
and
the
boy
said
it
is
a
poor
talisman
throw
it
no
brother
answered
the
child
the
old
woman
was
so
kind
to
me
for
her
sake
i
will
keep
it
always
and
who
knows
what
may
come
of
it
yet
so
she
wrapped
it
in
a
leaf
and
placed
it
in
her
bosom
then
they
said
their
prayers
and
covering
themselves
with
the
shawl
they
slept
soundly
till
morning
when
they
awoke
the
sun
was
shining
through
the
leaves
of
a
rich
banana
tree
and
the
ripe
golden
fruit
was
hanging
in
thick
bunches
just
above
their
heads
see
brother
said
the
little
girl
the
good
god
has
given
us
our
breakfast
and
they
gathered
from
the
ground
as
much
of
the
delicious
fruit
as
they
wished
i
am
so
thirsty
said
the
brother
i
hear
something
that
sounds
like
running
water
replied
zoie
so
they
looked
around
until
they
found
a
brook
with
a
clear
spring
of
water
bubbling
up
in
the
midst
of
the
shining
stones
i
thank
the
good
god
for
this
pure
clear
water
said
the
little
girl
drinking
with
much
pleasure
for
she
too
was
beginning
to
be
very
thirsty
we
must
go
now
said
the
boy
they
each
took
as
many
bananas
as
they
could
carry
and
started
to
go
they
knew
not
whither
they
were
and
happy
in
all
their
morning
wanderings
but
by
noon
they
began
to
feel
tired
hungry
and
thirsty
i
am
sorry
we
left
the
beautiful
shady
banana
tree
and
the
brook
it
is
so
hot
and
i
am
very
thirsty
said
the
boy
sadly
so
they
both
looked
for
water
but
could
find
none
god
will
give
us
some
by
and
by
said
the
little
sister
let
us
sit
down
and
eat
our
they
ate
their
bananas
with
sad
hearts
and
the
wide
world
seemed
very
desolate
all
around
them
the
grass
was
withered
and
the
trees
and
shrubs
were
dying
for
want
of
water
though
they
were
so
much
fatigued
and
it
was
very
warm
they
were
too
thirsty
to
think
of
rest
and
all
the
afternoon
they
wandered
about
looking
for
water
and
finding
none
by
and
by
the
twilight
came
on
then
the
stars
and
the
great
golden
moon
shone
upon
the
pale
face
of
the
children
glistening
with
tears
what
shall
we
do
sister
said
the
boy
weeping
and
falling
upon
the
ground
in
despair
we
shall
die
we
can
not
be
buried
by
the
lake
of
the
tuleis
with
the
dear
papa
and
do
not
cry
brother
said
the
little
zoie
her
own
eyes
filling
with
tears
i
am
sure
god
will
help
us
and
if
he
lets
us
die
here
he
will
send
the
birds
to
cover
us
with
leaves
as
they
did
the
poor
little
children
in
the
she
put
her
arms
around
her
brother
s
neck
and
kissed
him
saying
again
do
not
cry
dear
god
help
us
he
is
our
father
who
art
in
so
they
started
again
and
very
soon
they
saw
a
tiny
light
shining
through
the
trees
and
as
they
ran
forward
it
grew
brighter
and
clearer
and
they
heard
a
very
pleasant
sound
the
rushing
of
waters
taking
heart
again
they
urged
their
little
weary
feet
forward
till
they
came
to
a
mill
and
the
clear
light
shone
from
the
comfortable
room
in
which
sat
the
weary
miller
by
a
glowing
fire
while
his
young
son
prepared
the
supper
they
knocked
timidly
at
the
door
and
a
rough
kind
voice
said
come
they
entered
and
saw
the
miller
sitting
by
the
fire
and
his
handsome
young
son
spreading
the
table
the
old
man
spoke
to
them
but
they
could
not
understand
him
for
he
spoke
in
english
and
they
were
spanish
children
but
the
boy
said
in
the
soft
spanish
tongue
my
friends
who
are
you
and
where
did
you
come
from
the
little
girl
answered
we
are
poor
children
whose
papa
and
mamma
are
dead
and
god
takes
care
of
us
we
are
very
hungry
and
thirsty
and
he
showed
us
the
light
shining
from
your
window
so
we
are
here
then
the
boy
gave
them
milk
to
drink
and
put
two
more
plates
on
the
table
while
he
told
the
father
what
the
children
said
bless
her
innocent
heart
said
the
old
man
god
s
little
ones
are
he
took
the
child
in
his
arms
and
she
nestled
her
head
down
in
his
rough
neck
and
whispered
i
love
you
you
seem
like
the
dear
a
tear
came
into
the
old
man
s
eye
he
only
understood
the
word
papa
but
there
was
affection
in
the
little
arms
that
twined
around
his
neck
and
he
kissed
her
and
said
again
bless
her
little
her
winning
ways
touched
his
affectionate
nature
they
made
him
think
of
a
lonely
grave
and
his
own
lost
darling
meanwhile
the
boys
talked
pleasantly
till
supper
was
ready
then
they
sat
down
together
to
a
bountiful
table
and
the
hungry
children
ate
heartily
and
drank
the
pure
sweet
milk
which
after
their
long
thirst
seemed
delicious
after
supper
they
went
to
sleep
on
a
nice
spread
upon
the
floor
but
some
how
that
night
the
old
man
could
not
sleep
he
got
up
two
or
three
times
to
look
at
the
children
with
the
tears
standing
in
his
eyes
he
was
living
over
the
past
bless
her
little
heart
he
said
smoothing
with
his
rough
hand
the
soft
wavy
hair
of
the
little
girl
in
the
morning
the
children
woke
much
refreshed
at
first
they
did
not
know
where
they
were
but
they
saw
the
face
of
the
old
man
turned
kindly
toward
them
and
remembered
all
at
breakfast
the
brother
told
their
story
to
the
boy
and
he
interpreted
it
to
the
father
they
shall
stay
with
us
said
the
old
man
with
great
satisfaction
for
he
had
dreaded
parting
with
the
child
that
had
so
won
his
love
after
breakfast
they
went
into
the
mill
and
the
handsome
boy
told
the
orphans
his
story
in
return
some
years
ago
he
said
my
father
and
mother
came
to
this
country
bringing
my
little
sister
and
myself
mother
and
sister
died
very
soon
after
we
arrived
and
father
and
i
have
lived
here
alone
for
many
years
you
can
t
tell
how
lonely
it
was
at
first
he
continued
and
how
i
used
to
cry
myself
to
sleep
and
poor
father
was
very
sad
i
am
so
glad
you
are
going
to
stay
with
god
sent
us
said
the
little
girl
smiling
and
the
children
were
very
contented
and
happy
together
thus
they
lived
for
many
years
at
the
old
mill
the
little
zoie
grew
to
be
a
beautiful
maiden
as
good
as
fair
to
the
old
father
she
was
a
great
blessing
making
his
home
always
neat
and
pleasant
the
two
boys
were
handsome
strong
young
men
full
of
energy
and
life
every
day
they
roamed
over
the
mountains
prospecting
for
gold
the
old
mill
was
falling
to
decay
and
promised
but
little
in
the
future
one
evening
when
they
had
returned
after
a
hard
day
s
work
weary
and
out
of
heart
they
sat
down
on
the
stone
steps
of
the
old
mill
to
rest
themselves
the
waters
were
flowing
on
with
their
usual
pleasant
music
and
they
were
thinking
and
hoping
for
the
future
when
the
household
work
was
done
zoie
came
out
and
sat
by
them
to
amuse
them
she
told
over
the
old
story
of
the
strawberries
and
the
talisman
that
should
make
wishing
let
me
see
the
nut
said
the
miller
s
son
and
zoie
gave
it
to
him
placing
it
upon
the
stone
he
pressed
his
heel
upon
it
and
the
shell
burst
open
showing
a
silken
cap
of
bright
crimson
trimmed
with
cord
and
tassel
of
gold
they
were
all
greatly
surprised
and
the
miller
s
son
placed
it
upon
zoie
s
shining
hair
how
pretty
it
is
said
she
i
wish
i
had
a
filled
with
roses
of
the
same
she
had
hardly
spoken
before
a
covered
with
beautiful
crimson
flowers
sprang
up
at
their
feet
then
they
knew
that
the
pretty
silken
toy
was
a
wonderful
and
that
any
thing
they
might
desire
could
be
had
for
the
wishing
in
the
morning
when
the
young
men
went
out
zoie
put
on
the
cap
and
wished
they
might
find
a
mine
of
great
richness
though
we
could
now
live
without
the
trouble
of
working
she
said
to
the
father
a
rich
mine
would
help
hundreds
of
poor
people
who
would
find
employment
in
it
so
it
would
be
a
real
while
they
sat
talking
the
brother
rushed
in
bringing
a
great
nugget
of
gold
telling
how
at
last
they
had
found
a
mine
of
fabulous
richness
thus
they
had
every
thing
they
desired
till
one
day
the
miller
s
son
put
on
the
cap
and
told
zoie
that
above
every
thing
in
the
world
he
wished
that
she
might
love
him
and
consent
to
be
his
wife
the
young
maiden
blushed
and
begged
for
the
cap
it
was
not
quite
fair
she
said
in
wishing
that
so
they
talked
as
young
people
will
but
it
ended
in
her
placing
her
hand
in
his
and
promising
to
be
his
bride
and
this
as
the
father
said
was
the
best
wish
of
the
brother
was
greatly
pleased
and
said
zoie
shall
be
married
in
the
old
so
they
all
went
together
to
the
pleasant
adobe
house
from
which
they
had
fled
so
long
ago
the
was
greatly
surprised
so
see
them
she
had
so
often
reported
them
dead
that
she
really
began
to
believe
it
herself
she
was
obliged
to
give
up
everything
to
the
true
heirs
thus
she
and
her
children
became
very
poor
again
though
the
brothers
and
sisters
gave
her
a
comfortable
house
and
provided
for
her
she
was
very
ungrateful
she
was
a
disappointed
woman
unhappy
herself
and
making
others
so
around
her
it
was
a
glorious
day
when
the
young
people
were
married
and
zoie
in
her
robes
and
rich
lace
veil
was
as
fair
a
bride
as
the
sun
could
shine
upon
all
the
old
friends
of
the
family
were
invited
to
the
wedding
feast
and
the
old
servants
taken
home
again
every
one
was
rejoiced
to
see
the
orphans
enjoying
their
own
but
of
them
all
no
one
was
so
happy
as
the
old
miller
and
when
he
kissed
the
bride
after
the
ceremony
he
whispered
bless
your
little
heart
i
could
not
live
without
my
the
young
bride
looked
into
his
face
with
beaming
eyes
and
answered
only
my
thus
they
were
all
happy
and
through
the
changing
scenes
of
life
the
goodness
and
faith
of
the
wife
and
mother
never
failed
like
the
little
maid
zoie
in
the
dark
night
she
trusted
and
god
always
took
care
of
them
crimson
tuft
in
the
early
days
many
strange
things
happened
it
was
the
mystical
age
of
romance
in
the
gold
land
and
people
seemed
to
live
years
in
months
or
even
weeks
thus
a
great
deal
has
been
forgotten
in
the
old
countries
it
was
not
so
and
it
may
be
that
some
are
living
even
now
at
dear
bingen
on
the
rhine
who
remember
tenderly
the
handsome
young
couple
who
left
their
home
to
seek
the
alluring
treasures
of
the
gold
land
in
the
early
they
were
honest
peasants
in
the
father
land
but
over
the
waters
had
floated
the
marvelous
story
how
in
the
glorious
el
dorado
any
one
might
become
a
lord
of
the
soil
or
a
rich
miner
prince
this
it
was
that
fired
the
heart
of
the
father
and
as
the
mother
looked
upon
their
boy
she
too
was
ready
to
go
out
into
the
great
world
though
her
heart
lay
fondly
to
the
beloved
fatherland
they
had
little
money
but
the
thrifty
managed
to
work
for
one
and
another
on
the
passage
till
when
he
arrived
at
the
young
city
of
tents
within
the
golden
gate
he
had
cash
enough
to
make
a
beginning
in
life
they
were
soon
domesticated
in
a
little
shanty
and
in
a
short
time
had
prepared
a
fine
garden
which
became
the
s
pride
every
morning
dame
waltenburger
went
to
the
market
where
she
had
a
stall
and
sold
fruit
and
vegetables
for
gold
dust
for
that
was
the
currency
of
the
country
in
the
early
the
little
son
was
ten
years
old
and
a
real
delight
to
the
mother
s
heart
he
was
well
formed
with
fine
features
golden
brown
hair
and
wonderfully
expressive
eyes
when
he
was
calm
and
happy
they
were
of
a
soft
looming
blue
but
if
excited
or
angry
they
grew
dark
and
fierce
flashing
like
balls
of
fire
it
pleased
him
above
all
things
to
assist
the
dear
mother
at
the
market
and
very
soon
he
displayed
great
taste
in
the
arrangements
of
the
fruits
and
vegetables
with
maternal
pride
the
mother
often
told
the
neighbors
it
would
be
impossible
to
do
without
paul
for
really
he
was
the
greatest
help
to
her
when
the
flowers
were
in
blossom
the
boy
always
made
them
into
bouquets
and
garlands
while
his
pretty
ways
brought
many
a
purchaser
sometimes
he
used
to
carry
home
parcels
for
ladies
who
had
made
large
purchases
and
very
often
he
received
presents
from
them
with
the
regular
customers
the
handsome
little
fellow
was
a
great
favorite
one
day
as
paul
and
the
mother
sat
in
the
stall
together
talking
of
the
dear
fatherland
so
far
away
they
saw
a
very
spanish
woman
approaching
she
seemed
bowed
down
with
age
and
infirmities
and
leaned
heavily
upon
her
staff
as
she
hobbled
along
with
the
greatest
difficulty
after
the
spanish
fashion
her
head
was
covered
with
a
shawl
from
which
peered
her
thin
sharp
face
quite
furrowed
with
wrinkles
her
bleared
eyes
were
red
and
her
long
hooked
nose
nearly
met
her
pointed
chin
altogether
she
was
very
unpleasant
in
her
appearance
all
the
time
she
kept
her
toothless
mouth
moving
as
she
mumbled
indistinctly
to
herself
she
came
directly
up
to
dame
waltenburger
s
stall
and
entering
it
threw
herself
down
upon
the
bench
exclaiming
this
is
what
comes
of
growing
old
nothing
but
weariness
care
and
aching
of
bones
and
she
began
rubbing
her
knees
and
muttering
to
herself
little
paul
stood
looking
at
her
his
eyes
dilated
with
wonder
and
the
compassion
of
his
heart
made
them
blue
as
the
cloudless
sky
ah
exclaimed
the
old
woman
looking
into
his
innocent
face
with
a
hideous
grimace
what
are
you
staring
at
with
your
great
round
do
you
think
it
is
a
fine
thing
to
be
old
and
lame
and
poor
you
will
have
to
come
to
it
ah
yes
there
is
a
comfort
in
old
father
time
will
take
care
of
you
yes
yes
yes
and
she
shook
her
long
bony
fingers
and
chuckled
in
such
a
horrible
way
that
the
child
retreated
behind
the
mother
s
chair
and
hid
his
face
upon
her
protecting
shoulder
go
quickly
boy
and
bring
me
some
fresh
water
said
the
old
woman
i
am
very
thirsty
she
added
looking
at
the
mother
little
paul
took
a
glass
and
ran
away
to
the
well
and
drew
a
bucket
of
water
so
clear
and
sparkling
that
it
glistened
in
the
sunlight
like
the
dew
of
the
morning
as
he
carried
it
along
he
thought
how
the
professor
had
told
him
of
shining
nectar
that
hebe
used
to
bear
in
the
golden
cup
to
jupiter
and
all
the
gods
of
olympus
that
was
in
the
olden
time
he
said
but
no
nectar
could
be
more
beautiful
and
pure
than
the
water
the
loving
god
in
heaven
gives
to
us
offering
it
to
the
old
woman
his
open
rosy
face
beaming
with
smiles
he
said
it
is
nectar
fit
for
the
gods
and
i
am
your
then
he
bowed
so
prettily
that
the
mother
laughed
saying
did
one
ever
see
such
a
child
oh
you
mischief
and
she
shook
her
fingers
in
the
cunning
old
way
that
all
mothers
do
the
old
woman
took
the
glass
but
managed
to
spill
half
its
contents
over
the
child
s
clean
clothes
then
she
chuckled
with
delight
at
his
discomfiture
saying
see
what
it
is
to
be
old
my
little
while
the
mother
wiped
off
the
water
with
her
handkerchief
the
woman
began
picking
over
the
vegetables
and
fruit
with
her
thin
hooked
fingers
and
smelling
every
bouquet
of
flowers
till
little
paul
s
eyes
grew
dark
and
flashed
like
living
flames
just
see
her
mother
he
whispered
who
will
buy
them
after
she
has
handled
every
thing
with
her
dirty
hands
and
snuffed
all
the
sweetness
and
beauty
out
of
the
flowers
with
her
ugly
crooked
nose
oh
you
little
viper
cried
the
old
woman
springing
forward
i
ll
teach
you
to
mock
at
old
paul
was
too
quick
for
her
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
mother
she
would
have
fallen
in
her
eagerness
to
catch
him
never
mind
the
child
my
good
woman
said
dame
waltenburger
gently
we
were
all
children
once
now
how
can
i
serve
you
to
be
sure
we
were
all
children
once
ah
me
oh
no
i
don
t
mind
the
child
my
little
and
the
old
woman
drew
her
wizen
face
into
a
hundred
wrinkles
and
began
selecting
a
large
quantity
of
fruits
vegetables
and
herbs
far
more
than
she
could
carry
is
it
far
you
have
to
go
said
the
mother
illustration
no
no
not
far
replied
the
woman
so
the
mother
called
paul
to
help
her
he
was
very
reluctant
to
go
but
when
the
mother
kissed
him
and
promised
to
make
him
a
beautiful
ball
and
cover
it
with
red
morocco
he
came
forward
and
took
the
basket
readily
and
i
said
the
old
woman
will
give
him
a
beautiful
crimson
tuft
he
will
be
gay
as
a
lark
my
little
this
seemed
delightful
to
paul
and
he
followed
after
the
old
woman
thinking
i
can
play
soldier
with
the
crimson
tuft
and
the
professor
in
the
next
house
will
hear
me
and
call
me
charlemagne
it
will
be
glorious
to
be
the
soldier
with
the
crimson
little
paul
walked
on
in
quite
a
lordly
way
with
his
great
martial
thoughts
echoing
in
all
the
chambers
of
his
boyish
heart
it
will
be
glorious
the
soldier
of
the
crimson
tuft
on
on
they
went
far
out
into
the
sand
hills
in
an
opposite
direction
from
his
own
home
paul
s
arm
began
to
ache
very
much
carrying
the
heavy
basket
but
he
was
feeling
so
manly
that
he
did
not
like
to
complain
but
at
last
he
became
so
tired
that
it
was
no
use
he
could
not
bear
it
any
longer
and
great
tears
filled
his
eyes
and
covered
his
rosy
cheeks
all
the
way
the
old
woman
had
been
muttering
to
herself
in
spanish
but
paul
could
not
understand
that
i
am
so
tired
he
said
resting
the
basket
upon
the
ground
oh
it
is
not
far
not
far
and
i
will
give
you
the
bright
crimson
tuft
think
of
that
replied
the
old
woman
so
paul
took
up
the
basket
and
again
they
went
on
a
long
long
way
and
turned
so
many
corners
he
feared
he
could
never
find
his
way
back
but
still
the
thought
of
the
crimson
tuft
allured
him
i
must
have
it
he
said
that
would
be
a
real
at
last
when
he
was
just
ready
to
fall
down
with
fatigue
they
came
to
a
great
gate
and
the
old
woman
rung
the
bell
very
loudly
in
a
moment
a
great
rough
voice
called
in
spanish
as
through
a
trumpet
who
rings
at
the
gate
very
soon
the
gate
was
opened
by
a
dwarf
who
started
and
grinned
fearfully
when
he
saw
paul
the
child
offered
him
the
basket
but
he
only
shook
his
head
pointing
after
the
old
woman
who
gave
him
her
staff
and
walked
along
with
as
much
ease
as
little
paul
himself
now
the
child
was
really
frightened
and
would
have
run
away
but
he
was
already
within
the
gate
and
with
a
great
clang
it
closed
the
dwarf
put
up
the
iron
bars
and
replaced
the
bolts
nothing
could
be
more
secure
for
all
around
rose
an
immense
high
fence
topped
with
sharp
spikes
it
was
impossible
to
escape
no
one
could
get
in
or
out
a
long
avenue
led
to
a
house
built
in
the
spanish
fashion
it
was
shaded
with
beautiful
trees
that
had
been
brought
from
the
southern
country
how
they
waved
their
long
leaves
in
the
sunshine
it
was
a
picture
engraven
upon
the
child
s
mind
never
to
be
effaced
under
the
shadow
of
the
trees
walked
the
old
woman
toward
the
house
and
paul
followed
with
the
basket
trembling
like
the
light
leaves
of
the
tamarind
just
behind
him
came
the
dwarf
he
could
hear
his
heavy
tread
it
is
no
use
no
use
thought
the
child
but
he
would
gladly
have
given
the
tempting
crimson
tuft
the
red
morocco
ball
all
all
his
pretty
treasures
to
have
been
once
more
by
the
mother
s
side
selling
vegetables
in
the
market
they
entered
a
large
pleasant
with
doors
opening
upon
the
front
piazza
and
upon
the
verandah
of
the
inner
court
so
that
though
it
was
very
warm
a
delicious
breeze
swept
through
the
room
and
made
it
delightfully
cool
the
old
woman
threw
herself
upon
a
couch
and
pointing
to
a
silver
bell
told
paul
to
ring
it
adding
my
little
you
must
be
tired
and
i
will
order
something
to
refresh
you
before
you
return
to
your
good
i
am
not
so
very
tired
said
paul
let
me
go
the
mother
will
need
me
and
he
looked
imploringly
into
the
pitiless
face
that
he
was
beginning
to
fear
above
all
things
ring
the
bell
boy
was
the
only
answer
so
he
rang
the
bell
and
the
dwarf
who
had
left
them
on
the
piazza
entered
the
woman
addressed
him
in
spanish
which
paul
did
not
understand
but
as
he
went
to
and
from
a
large
closet
and
began
spreading
the
table
he
would
turn
his
curious
squinting
eyes
upon
the
child
with
looks
of
compassion
in
a
short
time
all
was
ready
and
what
a
delicious
lunch
it
might
have
been
to
the
child
but
for
the
great
fear
that
overshadowed
him
delicate
cakes
and
confections
cold
chicken
eggs
and
all
kinds
of
fruits
that
children
are
so
fond
of
with
many
things
that
paul
had
never
seen
before
there
was
a
great
pyramid
of
how
i
should
like
to
eat
it
with
the
dear
mother
thought
paul
oh
that
a
delicious
lunch
to
be
sure
come
let
us
sit
down
said
the
old
woman
i
am
not
hungry
answered
paul
timidly
for
he
longed
so
greatly
to
be
at
home
that
even
these
unaccustomed
delicacies
and
the
promised
crimson
tuft
were
as
nothing
compared
with
the
sweet
comfort
at
the
dear
mother
s
side
you
silly
child
you
have
walked
all
this
distance
carrying
that
great
basket
and
are
not
hungry
well
you
are
thirsty
and
for
your
nectar
of
the
gods
i
will
return
you
the
sherbet
of
an
eastern
the
woman
filled
a
glass
with
a
clear
rosy
liquid
that
bubbled
up
and
sparkled
so
temptingly
that
little
paul
who
was
quite
overcome
with
fatigue
and
thirst
grasped
it
eagerly
and
did
not
take
the
glass
from
his
lips
till
he
had
drained
it
to
the
bottom
then
he
wished
to
start
for
home
but
he
felt
so
drowsy
that
he
could
not
move
he
thought
of
the
mother
but
felt
no
emotion
and
looked
at
the
hideous
old
woman
who
was
grinning
horribly
without
fear
in
a
few
moments
he
sunk
down
upon
the
couch
in
a
heavy
sleep
the
woman
stood
over
him
chuckling
in
great
glee
i
have
you
now
my
pretty
and
will
make
you
of
great
use
to
me
i
will
teach
you
a
thousand
things
you
would
be
glad
not
to
know
you
shall
have
a
crimson
tuft
ha
ha
ha
i
will
teach
you
to
be
impertinent
to
me
my
hooked
nose
to
be
sure
ah
i
am
old
old
and
nothing
can
make
me
young
and
fair
if
i
could
only
take
for
myself
your
young
beauty
but
no
one
day
i
must
die
and
that
will
be
the
the
woman
s
face
grew
convulsed
for
she
was
haunted
by
the
grim
specter
death
as
with
a
dread
terror
her
life
had
been
so
filled
with
darkness
that
she
could
not
look
forward
to
the
calm
hereafter
all
the
brightness
and
beauty
of
heaven
the
golden
was
like
the
fleeting
dreams
of
childhood
that
the
rolling
years
bearing
her
to
the
portals
of
dim
old
age
had
swept
away
she
had
studied
magic
and
tried
to
find
the
elixir
of
life
but
in
vain
she
had
discovered
many
wonderful
things
but
not
the
fountain
of
perpetual
youth
nor
the
precious
elixir
of
life
for
a
few
moments
she
stood
gazing
at
the
fresh
face
and
rich
curls
of
the
child
as
he
lay
sleeping
in
his
pure
innocence
once
the
word
mother
passed
his
rosy
lips
and
the
woman
waved
a
perfumed
fan
over
him
till
even
the
mother
was
no
longer
the
companion
of
his
dreamless
sleep
now
it
will
do
to
begin
said
the
old
woman
and
she
took
from
a
secret
drawer
in
the
closet
several
bottles
containing
liquids
and
placed
them
on
a
little
table
taking
a
pair
of
sharp
scissors
she
sat
down
by
the
child
and
cut
off
all
his
beautiful
brown
curls
leaving
only
a
little
tuft
this
she
made
quite
stiff
in
some
way
and
colored
it
bright
red
tying
it
upon
the
top
of
his
head
so
that
it
stood
up
and
looked
very
strangely
there
is
the
crimson
tuft
my
little
she
said
laughing
heartily
at
her
wicked
work
then
she
tinged
his
eyebrows
red
and
his
skin
a
dark
mahogany
color
until
instead
of
the
beautiful
little
paul
that
everybody
had
loved
and
admired
he
appeared
the
ugliest
little
wretch
one
could
well
imagine
she
took
off
his
neat
plain
clothes
dressing
him
in
yellow
leather
breeches
and
a
fantastic
red
jacket
upon
his
feet
she
put
shoes
with
long
pointed
toes
that
turned
up
and
were
tied
with
red
ribbons
when
she
had
finished
she
looked
at
him
with
great
satisfaction
even
the
old
dame
herself
would
not
know
her
cub
now
what
an
ugly
little
goat
he
has
become
to
be
sure
and
the
old
woman
after
her
usual
way
muttered
to
herself
at
last
she
sat
down
and
eating
and
drinking
for
by
this
time
she
was
quite
hungry
every
few
moments
she
would
stop
and
rub
her
long
bony
hands
together
and
laugh
as
she
looked
at
the
transformed
child
paul
slept
all
the
afternoon
and
awoke
in
the
dusky
shadow
of
the
twilight
confused
and
bewildered
to
find
himself
in
a
strange
room
with
the
horrible
woman
sitting
before
a
blazing
fire
gazing
steadily
into
its
fantastic
pictures
at
first
he
could
not
tell
where
he
was
but
in
a
moment
he
remembered
all
and
jumped
up
in
the
greatest
excitement
saying
how
could
i
have
slept
when
the
dear
mother
was
expecting
me
she
will
be
so
anxious
oh
let
me
go
to
her
please
good
lady
let
me
go
what
do
you
mean
answered
the
old
woman
you
have
no
mother
you
are
my
little
servant
crimson
tuft
i
gave
you
that
name
myself
on
account
of
your
red
hair
which
stands
up
like
a
crest
on
the
top
of
your
ugly
then
the
child
began
to
cry
saying
my
hair
is
not
red
and
my
name
is
paul
and
it
was
my
dear
mother
who
sold
you
vegetables
at
the
market
this
morning
let
me
go
home
oh
please
let
me
go
home
to
the
dear
the
child
s
voice
was
broken
with
sobs
but
the
woman
only
laughed
ha
ha
it
is
a
curious
dream
you
have
had
or
are
you
going
crazy
your
hair
not
red
indeed
why
look
in
the
glass
she
led
him
to
a
mirror
and
there
the
unhappy
child
saw
reflected
the
ugly
wretch
called
crimson
tuft
but
never
again
the
handsome
little
paul
the
child
was
more
frightened
and
bewildered
than
ever
he
was
sure
he
had
left
the
mother
that
morning
in
company
with
this
horrible
old
woman
every
thing
in
the
rude
little
home
rose
in
his
mind
yet
he
could
not
realize
his
own
identity
paul
surely
he
could
not
see
in
the
reflecting
mirror
only
the
ugly
little
crimson
tuft
he
raised
his
hands
and
took
hold
of
the
stiff
shock
of
red
hair
that
stood
right
upon
his
head
oh
no
it
was
not
paul
s
soft
silken
curls
yet
there
a
about
the
eyes
that
reminded
him
of
paul
but
even
they
were
very
different
they
were
the
red
swollen
eyes
of
crimson
tuft
are
you
satisfied
now
said
the
old
woman
it
was
only
a
dream
a
queer
dream
that
you
have
had
crimson
tuft
and
how
funny
that
you
should
think
you
were
an
old
s
child
you
my
servant
who
have
never
been
out
of
this
place
in
your
still
the
child
only
cried
the
more
and
entreated
let
me
go
home
to
the
mother
let
me
go
though
he
was
faint
from
the
effects
of
the
narcotic
and
from
fasting
for
a
long
time
he
refused
food
and
continued
to
sob
begging
the
old
woman
to
let
him
go
home
but
she
only
answered
you
are
dreaming
still
or
then
she
told
him
how
sometimes
people
were
bewitched
and
did
not
know
themselves
still
i
am
paul
let
me
at
last
the
woman
losing
all
patience
called
the
dwarf
to
beat
him
if
he
did
not
stop
crying
and
begin
to
eat
so
terror
and
hunger
at
last
conquered
and
the
little
boy
choking
down
his
sobs
sat
upon
a
stool
in
silence
to
eat
his
supper
very
desolate
and
leaden
hearted
from
that
day
a
new
era
commenced
in
the
history
of
the
child
an
era
of
servitude
sorrow
and
tears
that
washed
away
so
far
into
the
past
the
memory
of
his
free
and
joyous
childhood
that
he
began
to
believe
what
the
woman
so
often
told
him
that
his
mind
had
gone
astray
that
he
had
been
bewitched
sometimes
he
would
stand
looking
long
into
the
great
mirror
at
the
stiff
red
hairs
and
brown
skin
of
poor
crimson
tuft
thinking
what
a
beautiful
myth
it
was
about
the
happy
little
paul
and
the
dear
mother
how
it
had
stolen
into
his
heart
like
a
real
life
and
still
the
señora
as
all
about
the
house
called
her
said
it
was
only
a
bewildering
dream
into
his
eyes
he
would
often
look
saying
those
are
paul
s
eyes
but
the
red
brows
give
a
different
expression
to
their
sadness
he
would
add
no
no
they
are
not
paul
s
always
the
red
hair
brown
skin
and
sorrowful
heart
i
must
be
only
poor
crimson
very
often
his
hungry
heart
would
cry
out
oh
mother
mother
too
often
the
shrill
voice
of
the
old
woman
would
be
the
discordant
answer
sending
him
to
some
new
task
as
months
then
years
rolled
by
the
child
became
more
accustomed
to
his
sorrowful
lot
and
in
many
ways
it
grew
pleasanter
he
learned
to
talk
spanish
fluently
and
became
very
fond
of
the
queer
looking
dwarf
who
had
frightened
him
so
much
at
first
he
often
talked
to
him
about
his
mysterious
change
but
of
these
things
the
dwarf
would
never
speak
so
at
last
crimson
tuft
ceased
to
mention
them
his
friend
taught
him
many
things
in
leisure
hours
to
read
write
and
solve
difficult
problems
so
that
at
twelve
he
was
as
much
advanced
in
his
studies
as
most
boys
of
his
age
with
the
señora
he
had
become
quite
a
favorite
although
at
first
for
a
long
time
he
had
only
menial
service
to
perform
there
came
a
change
one
day
she
heard
him
reading
aloud
to
the
dwarf
and
was
so
much
delighted
with
his
distinct
enunciation
and
fine
rendition
of
what
happened
to
be
a
favorite
author
that
she
called
him
to
her
private
library
and
talked
a
long
time
in
a
way
she
had
never
before
addressed
him
he
is
a
boy
of
quick
mind
thought
she
and
may
be
more
than
an
ordinary
servant
to
me
he
is
just
what
i
shall
need
in
my
troublesome
mexican
affairs
i
must
train
him
to
his
from
that
day
he
used
to
sit
hours
in
the
library
reading
to
her
and
often
she
gave
him
long
papers
to
copy
which
he
was
soon
able
to
do
to
her
entire
satisfaction
very
often
she
would
talk
to
him
as
though
he
were
a
man
in
fact
the
training
he
was
receiving
brought
only
the
man
s
thoughts
he
had
left
his
happy
boyhood
at
the
little
stall
in
the
one
day
he
found
an
old
guitar
in
the
attic
of
an
which
was
filled
with
broken
furniture
and
many
things
disused
and
forgotten
from
that
hour
he
enjoyed
a
real
pleasure
in
a
short
time
he
picked
out
the
chords
and
wove
them
into
delicious
harmonies
and
then
there
came
into
his
mind
a
rich
old
melody
of
the
fatherland
it
was
like
the
memory
of
a
happy
dream
and
the
tears
filled
his
eyes
again
he
was
happy
for
every
thing
save
the
spell
of
the
divine
melody
was
forgotten
two
more
years
glided
by
and
the
young
boy
was
advancing
toward
manhood
he
was
tall
and
finely
developed
and
deep
within
his
dreamy
eyes
slept
the
wonderful
magnetic
charm
still
the
brown
skin
and
stiff
hair
remained
and
he
was
only
poor
ugly
crimson
tuft
in
all
this
time
he
had
never
been
outside
the
massive
gate
which
was
always
strongly
locked
and
barred
and
though
he
had
often
entreated
the
dwarf
the
only
reply
was
a
grave
shake
of
the
head
and
a
sad
compassionate
look
from
the
odd
squinting
eyes
of
his
companion
and
if
he
persisted
the
dwarf
would
go
away
and
leave
him
alone
he
had
never
ventured
to
speak
to
the
señora
but
once
on
the
subject
in
years
and
then
her
fury
was
so
unbounded
that
he
feared
she
would
tear
him
in
pieces
with
her
long
bony
fingers
which
when
she
was
enraged
possessed
the
power
of
a
vice
for
a
week
after
she
fed
him
on
bread
and
water
and
kept
him
confined
in
a
dark
room
with
too
heavy
tasks
to
allow
him
to
question
the
mysterious
past
or
speculate
on
the
uncertain
future
always
a
foolish
dreamer
she
said
i
will
teach
you
something
you
the
crimson
yet
it
was
all
no
use
the
boy
had
his
thoughts
that
could
not
be
chained
he
was
determined
to
escape
i
will
not
excite
suspicion
i
will
strive
to
please
and
a
time
will
come
yes
the
time
will
come
when
i
shall
know
thus
in
striving
to
lull
the
suspicions
of
the
woman
to
sleep
he
grew
into
great
favor
and
became
indispensable
to
her
he
can
do
so
many
things
that
no
one
else
can
do
she
would
say
to
herself
but
those
great
luminous
eyes
torment
me
if
they
too
could
be
changed
but
that
is
beyond
my
power
would
i
could
make
them
dull
leaden
and
red
as
his
flaming
crimson
tuft
he
is
useful
very
useful
but
there
are
times
with
all
his
quiet
seeming
when
i
think
he
suspects
me
dare
i
trust
him
that
is
the
here
the
old
woman
would
fall
into
long
fits
of
musing
and
gaze
into
the
glowing
embers
till
they
faded
into
dead
ashes
one
morning
the
old
woman
called
crimson
tuft
to
her
saying
i
am
going
away
to
be
gone
for
some
days
and
i
want
you
to
copy
these
papers
for
me
they
are
the
deeds
and
other
valuable
papers
of
my
property
in
mexico
which
you
will
see
is
very
great
let
the
copies
be
made
with
great
distinctness
for
these
duplicates
may
be
required
you
see
i
am
cautious
and
trust
you
very
much
very
a
look
of
suspicion
crossed
her
sharp
wizen
face
but
in
the
ugly
brown
countenance
she
could
detect
nothing
but
truth
and
sincerity
i
can
do
no
better
she
thought
but
aloud
she
added
the
dwarf
knows
all
and
will
see
to
the
safety
of
these
and
every
thing
if
one
of
them
is
lost
it
would
bring
no
end
of
trouble
and
you
would
have
your
with
an
ominous
shake
of
the
head
the
old
señora
rose
and
left
crimson
tuft
bending
over
the
yellowed
parchment
that
was
of
the
most
inestimable
value
to
her
about
noon
she
left
the
house
with
the
dwarf
following
her
to
the
gate
which
when
she
had
passed
he
barred
more
securely
than
ever
for
some
days
crimson
tuft
worked
diligently
over
the
papers
there
were
deeds
of
haciendas
and
mines
mortgages
and
grants
of
land
and
many
long
intricate
pages
of
law
papers
really
to
copy
all
these
was
a
task
and
crimson
tuft
was
filled
with
amazement
at
the
greatness
of
the
old
señora
s
possessions
at
last
they
were
all
finished
and
locked
up
by
the
dwarf
in
the
oaken
chest
and
that
again
was
locked
in
the
great
closet
and
the
dwarf
carried
the
key
so
it
was
very
secure
still
the
old
señora
did
not
return
now
the
time
has
come
thought
crimson
tuft
i
must
but
that
was
easier
planned
than
done
everywhere
the
dwarf
followed
him
and
when
crimson
tuft
grew
angry
he
laid
his
heavy
hand
upon
his
arm
saying
from
the
first
i
have
loved
you
boy
believe
me
it
will
all
be
well
only
wait
a
little
then
crimson
tuft
took
his
hard
honest
hand
saying
you
alone
have
loved
me
and
for
your
sake
i
will
wait
but
not
long
i
do
not
ask
one
evening
about
a
week
after
this
the
bell
rang
and
the
señora
entered
followed
by
a
most
beautiful
little
maiden
about
twelve
years
of
age
she
was
dressed
in
mourning
with
a
black
shawl
about
her
head
her
long
glossy
hair
hung
carelessly
over
her
graceful
shoulders
her
complexion
was
a
clear
olive
and
her
skin
soft
and
smooth
as
satin
while
her
large
dark
eyes
had
a
depth
as
of
the
mystic
sea
and
a
pure
clear
look
as
of
heaven
they
were
more
beautiful
than
any
thing
crimson
tuft
had
ever
seen
and
some
how
they
startled
him
it
was
not
like
the
old
vision
yet
it
touched
him
more
deeply
this
was
of
the
present
that
of
the
past
this
is
my
only
granddaughter
said
the
old
woman
to
the
dwarf
and
crimson
tuft
both
bowed
very
low
to
the
pretty
señorita
they
were
such
a
pair
that
she
clapped
her
dainty
little
hands
together
laughing
in
a
pure
ringing
tone
clear
as
the
notes
of
a
silver
bell
poor
crimson
tuft
was
very
much
confused
for
to
him
the
young
donna
leota
was
the
first
dream
of
beauty
that
had
kindled
the
dawning
fire
of
manhood
in
his
heart
and
he
was
ready
to
bow
down
and
kiss
her
in
the
sand
strange
to
say
the
little
leota
swayed
the
grandmother
as
absolutely
as
she
had
ruled
the
dwarf
and
crimson
tuft
but
in
one
respect
the
old
woman
was
resolute
the
heavy
gate
was
locked
as
securely
upon
leota
as
upon
the
other
inmates
of
the
mansion
and
no
persuasion
could
induce
her
to
change
in
this
regard
leota
was
passionately
fond
of
music
and
played
the
harp
very
sweetly
once
in
the
still
hours
of
night
she
was
awakened
by
the
notes
of
her
own
harp
vibrating
in
the
most
exquisite
harmony
she
was
filled
with
delight
though
she
trembled
with
fear
for
she
was
quite
sure
there
was
no
one
in
the
house
who
knew
any
thing
of
music
but
herself
yet
the
chords
were
swept
as
by
a
master
s
hand
she
lay
motionless
until
the
last
note
died
away
and
it
was
long
before
she
fell
asleep
for
the
spell
of
the
rich
melodies
still
floated
through
the
air
around
her
in
the
morning
she
spoke
of
it
but
no
one
could
explain
the
mystery
again
and
again
in
the
silent
hours
came
the
rich
melody
not
old
familiar
airs
but
the
exquisite
improvisations
of
genius
one
night
when
the
golden
moon
was
casting
its
soft
amber
light
over
land
and
sea
and
the
enchanted
harp
sending
forth
its
entrancing
strains
leota
rose
softly
from
her
couch
and
summoning
all
her
courage
determined
herself
to
solve
the
mystery
she
glided
quietly
along
the
to
the
large
glass
door
of
the
parlor
and
there
she
saw
crimson
tuft
bending
fondly
over
the
harp
and
calling
out
the
bewildering
melody
that
she
had
thought
could
be
born
only
of
mystical
enchantment
the
imagination
of
the
young
girl
was
so
vivid
that
she
was
easily
prepared
for
things
supernatural
but
to
see
poor
brown
crimson
tuft
the
great
magician
he
the
slave
of
whom
she
thought
only
to
laugh
at
this
was
stranger
than
all
the
soft
moonlight
fell
full
upon
his
face
and
his
large
luminous
eyes
were
dewy
with
the
spirit
of
the
rich
melody
with
the
rare
beauty
that
was
all
their
own
they
almost
redeemed
the
brown
skin
and
flaming
hair
from
positive
ugliness
leota
stood
entranced
till
the
last
note
died
out
of
the
thrilled
chords
of
the
trembling
harp
then
as
she
turned
to
go
the
rustling
of
her
robe
caused
crimson
tuft
to
raise
his
eyes
and
they
fell
full
upon
her
face
to
him
at
least
the
most
beautiful
face
in
the
world
he
was
covered
with
deep
confusion
over
his
redeeming
eyes
fell
the
heavy
red
lashes
and
the
ugly
brows
contracted
she
his
rare
divinity
had
seen
him
play
and
heard
how
the
notes
flowed
from
his
own
heart
through
the
sympathizing
that
thrilled
with
his
devotion
to
her
which
would
last
all
his
life
long
leota
was
greatly
bewildered
and
as
she
stole
away
to
her
own
room
strange
thoughts
chased
themselves
through
her
mind
not
one
word
had
been
spoken
but
every
thing
had
changed
crimson
tuft
was
no
longer
only
the
ugly
servant
of
her
grandmother
but
he
was
crimson
tuft
of
the
mystery
there
was
something
interesting
in
that
besides
shut
up
in
those
high
walls
with
only
the
old
grandmother
for
company
and
little
amusement
one
must
think
a
great
deal
so
leota
had
her
thoughts
crimson
tuft
had
wonderful
eyes
she
had
found
that
out
and
it
was
a
great
deal
there
in
that
dull
place
she
wished
to
be
in
mexico
again
where
the
most
beautiful
flowers
bloom
and
the
delicious
fruit
grows
ripe
on
the
trees
yet
she
did
not
like
to
think
she
would
never
see
the
beautiful
eyes
again
but
one
must
not
think
too
much
of
a
servant
she
would
say
to
herself
she
was
of
good
blood
and
that
would
not
do
yet
one
must
treat
inferiors
really
it
was
difficult
to
tell
what
one
must
do
so
all
in
a
maze
she
fell
asleep
and
dreamed
of
the
most
radiant
eyes
which
crimson
tuft
s
and
the
handsomest
face
which
surely
crimson
tuft
s
the
morning
dawned
clear
and
bright
as
crimson
tuft
arose
and
began
the
duties
of
the
day
though
he
was
advanced
to
the
post
of
private
secretary
the
old
señora
had
left
him
some
tasks
in
the
early
part
of
the
day
that
would
prevent
him
from
forgetting
his
position
as
a
servant
first
he
swept
and
dusted
the
parlor
and
halls
this
had
always
been
his
work
and
no
one
else
could
please
the
señora
so
well
as
he
dusted
the
señorita
s
harp
a
flash
of
indignation
filled
his
heart
he
was
only
a
servant
the
ugly
crimson
tuft
and
she
the
most
beautiful
maiden
the
divinity
of
his
soul
there
was
a
great
difference
yet
he
felt
himself
a
man
and
he
would
conquer
fate
in
the
end
even
with
his
ugly
crimson
tuft
this
was
what
he
thought
when
leota
appeared
she
said
nothing
of
her
discovery
but
when
she
spoke
to
him
it
was
in
a
different
tone
from
formerly
the
mystery
of
the
enchanted
harp
was
over
but
the
greater
mystery
had
begun
the
wonderful
eyes
acted
as
a
talisman
upon
her
heart
and
though
she
strove
against
it
she
found
herself
forgetting
crimson
tuft
s
position
his
ugly
brown
skin
and
red
hair
one
glance
of
his
beaming
eyes
would
set
her
warm
blood
dancing
through
her
veins
till
her
neck
and
brow
were
a
soft
and
this
was
in
no
way
pleasant
to
the
proud
little
maiden
the
next
night
crimson
tuft
did
not
touch
the
harp
and
in
the
morning
the
donna
leota
passed
him
at
his
work
with
a
haughty
toss
of
her
dainty
head
but
with
a
quiver
in
her
voice
she
said
crimson
tuft
play
when
you
like
the
music
pleases
after
that
crimson
tuft
would
always
play
at
twilight
and
even
the
old
grandmother
was
touched
by
the
magical
spell
of
his
genius
every
year
the
old
woman
grew
more
infirm
till
she
could
not
even
walk
from
room
to
room
without
leaning
upon
her
staff
at
times
her
temper
was
terrible
and
nothing
but
the
soft
touch
of
leota
s
hand
could
calm
her
she
loved
with
all
her
strong
hard
nature
the
young
maiden
who
daily
was
growing
to
womanhood
crowned
with
surpassing
beauty
she
was
getting
very
old
with
an
iron
will
she
resisted
the
pitiless
hand
of
time
but
she
could
not
stay
it
her
long
hands
became
more
bony
and
angular
her
eyes
more
red
and
bleared
and
her
voice
more
cracked
and
shrill
yet
she
seemed
to
be
looking
forward
to
a
long
life
and
was
more
hard
and
grasping
than
ever
it
was
only
leota
that
she
loved
more
than
gold
one
night
crimson
tuft
had
a
curious
dream
he
thought
as
he
lay
half
sleeping
and
half
waking
dreaming
delightful
but
impossible
things
that
the
old
woman
came
in
softly
and
poured
something
upon
his
head
and
that
when
he
started
she
held
a
sponge
to
his
nose
until
he
sank
back
powerless
he
seemed
to
inhale
something
sweet
and
fragrant
it
was
very
pleasant
and
soothing
that
was
all
he
could
remember
in
the
morning
he
felt
heavy
and
drowsy
his
head
ached
but
he
roused
himself
rose
and
dressed
as
usual
when
he
looked
in
the
glass
he
saw
that
his
hair
was
redder
and
his
skin
a
deeper
brown
than
ever
memories
and
a
strange
suspicion
flashed
over
his
mind
far
back
in
the
years
he
remembered
dimly
a
little
boy
named
paul
a
fair
child
whom
he
had
been
taught
to
believe
a
dream
there
was
a
mystery
could
she
have
changed
paul
to
crimson
tuft
in
a
night
after
this
crimson
tuft
became
more
thoughtful
than
ever
there
was
a
mystery
to
solve
and
he
would
devote
all
his
energies
to
it
he
was
eighteen
years
old
a
very
intelligent
young
man
but
entirely
unacquainted
with
the
world
he
had
yet
much
to
learn
one
day
the
old
woman
called
him
to
her
and
looked
in
her
curious
way
at
him
for
a
long
time
crimson
tuft
she
said
you
are
my
servant
but
i
have
given
you
great
advantages
so
that
you
are
as
well
educated
as
many
a
rich
man
s
son
but
that
is
not
all
i
wish
to
make
your
then
the
old
woman
fell
into
a
deep
study
and
crimson
tuft
stood
waiting
and
wondering
what
would
come
next
at
length
he
grew
tired
señora
he
said
you
wanted
to
speak
with
she
gave
a
sudden
start
as
he
spoke
oh
yes
she
replied
but
i
had
forgotten
you
you
are
my
servant
and
have
been
so
always
asked
crimson
tuft
a
dark
frown
passed
over
the
old
woman
s
face
and
crimson
tuft
regretted
his
folly
he
was
very
anxious
to
hear
what
she
had
to
say
to
him
there
might
be
some
hope
of
relief
but
again
she
was
silent
and
worse
than
all
she
seemed
displeased
the
donna
leota
passed
the
open
window
singing
lightly
a
pretty
spanish
air
and
the
shadows
began
to
clear
away
from
the
clouded
brow
excuse
me
señora
said
crimson
tuft
softly
if
in
some
way
i
can
serve
you
i
shall
be
only
too
he
too
had
heard
the
soothing
song
crimson
tuft
she
replied
i
am
not
now
so
strong
as
i
was
twenty
good
years
ago
and
i
want
some
one
near
me
whom
i
can
trust
for
i
have
affairs
that
must
be
attended
to
now
some
one
who
will
not
cheat
me
out
of
my
gold
i
have
looked
carefully
about
and
can
see
no
one
but
you
you
whom
i
have
trained
educated
and
cared
for
so
many
years
the
world
is
so
ungrateful
and
wicked
even
you
who
owe
every
thing
to
me
might
rob
me
me
an
old
woman
it
would
be
a
wicked
thing
a
great
crime
the
red
eager
eyes
of
the
old
woman
were
fastened
upon
the
face
of
the
young
man
and
with
all
her
shrewdness
she
tried
to
read
him
her
pinched
features
grew
sharper
and
her
voice
shrill
as
the
whistling
wind
she
grasped
her
staff
and
hobbled
across
the
room
several
times
in
an
excited
manner
you
are
such
a
curious
ugly
fellow
what
have
to
hope
for
in
the
world
save
from
me
but
if
you
are
faithful
i
will
advance
you
but
i
can
as
easily
punish
as
the
red
blood
flushed
even
the
brown
cheek
of
the
boy
for
he
was
painfully
conscious
of
his
extreme
ugliness
and
he
thought
sadly
of
the
donna
leota
listen
boy
continued
the
old
woman
there
is
a
great
world
beyond
these
walls
can
i
trust
you
to
go
away
over
the
waters
with
me
remember
all
i
promise
you
and
be
she
looked
steadfastly
into
the
luminous
eyes
of
crimson
tuft
that
dilated
with
pleasurable
exultation
she
was
evidently
satisfied
with
the
truth
and
sincerity
she
saw
beaming
there
for
she
proceeded
i
must
go
again
to
mexico
but
not
alone
the
donna
leota
will
accompany
me
for
in
the
years
to
come
i
can
not
be
separated
from
her
and
you
must
go
as
i
shall
need
you
i
am
very
rich
and
must
trust
you
with
a
great
secret
but
i
have
studied
you
señora
said
crimson
tuft
eagerly
i
will
be
true
to
you
you
shall
never
swear
it
she
said
fiercely
so
the
young
boy
knelt
and
pressed
the
good
book
to
his
lips
repeating
after
her
a
most
solemn
oath
to
serve
her
faithfully
and
keep
sacred
the
great
secret
which
was
to
be
revealed
to
leota
only
in
case
of
the
grandmother
s
death
now
she
said
i
am
weary
i
will
tell
you
and
she
leaned
back
in
the
and
shaded
her
eyes
with
her
fan
crimson
tuft
went
out
with
his
heart
beating
wild
in
a
tumult
of
conflicting
emotions
on
the
morrow
again
she
called
him
to
the
library
and
locked
the
door
i
have
made
my
will
she
said
and
you
are
handsomely
provided
for
in
consideration
of
your
proving
faithful
to
the
trust
i
repose
in
you
besides
this
while
i
live
you
shall
never
want
for
gold
is
it
all
fully
understood
then
crimson
tuft
said
it
is
understood
señora
and
she
took
from
her
desk
a
carefully
sealed
paper
which
she
wrapped
in
and
again
sealing
it
gave
it
to
the
boy
this
paper
she
said
describes
the
exact
spot
where
a
great
treasure
is
hidden
upon
my
hacienda
near
the
city
of
mexico
there
is
no
chance
of
your
gaining
this
for
yourself
for
there
are
two
other
persons
living
who
have
similar
papers
indeed
precautions
that
i
shall
not
tell
you
of
have
been
taken
so
that
it
must
fall
to
the
donna
leota
at
last
for
she
is
the
only
true
heiress
you
see
i
am
cautious
very
cautious
she
added
the
old
look
of
suspicion
rising
in
her
face
from
this
day
crimson
tuft
was
her
chief
adviser
he
and
the
dwarf
made
all
preparations
for
the
journey
in
about
a
week
all
was
ready
and
they
went
to
san
francisco
in
a
carriage
which
drove
immediately
down
to
the
steamer
and
they
were
soon
comfortably
settled
on
board
now
said
crimson
tuft
there
is
still
time
and
i
can
walk
about
the
city
for
half
an
but
the
señora
grew
excited
and
exclaimed
no
no
you
might
get
lost
remember
you
are
a
and
the
donna
leota
said
softly
surely
you
will
not
go
away
so
the
dwarf
performed
all
the
commissions
and
for
an
hour
the
señora
was
absent
but
before
leaving
she
had
said
to
crimson
tuft
i
leave
the
donna
leota
in
your
at
length
the
ship
sailed
then
came
the
long
sluggish
dreamy
days
at
sea
crimson
tuft
and
leota
were
often
together
upon
the
deck
for
the
old
señora
would
not
allow
her
there
alone
what
golden
days
they
were
to
the
poor
crimson
tuft
more
and
more
he
was
growing
to
love
the
pretty
young
señorita
and
she
could
not
resist
the
powerful
spell
of
his
luminous
eyes
one
night
she
rushed
wildly
through
the
saloon
to
his
the
grandmother
had
been
taken
suddenly
very
ill
and
must
see
crimson
tuft
she
breathed
with
great
difficulty
and
her
words
came
low
and
broken
if
i
live
to
reach
mexico
you
will
not
need
this
paper
but
i
am
old
she
added
bitterly
and
the
old
must
with
great
pain
she
went
on
if
i
should
not
live
to
reach
the
hacienda
you
will
see
the
child
has
her
own
dig
up
the
treasure
yourself
and
do
not
defraud
her
of
one
single
gold
piece
or
the
curse
of
a
dying
woman
will
follow
you
even
from
the
darkness
of
the
then
again
crimson
tuft
promised
and
taking
the
paper
left
her
alone
with
the
child
as
she
still
fondly
called
the
donna
leota
this
attack
passed
away
but
another
soon
followed
and
again
crimson
tuft
was
summoned
to
her
side
her
glazed
eye
brightened
as
she
saw
him
remember
was
all
she
could
say
and
again
he
made
the
solemn
promise
it
was
the
third
and
last
time
with
the
old
señora
all
was
now
over
leota
trembled
with
fear
and
wept
bitterly
the
grandmother
had
loved
her
and
now
there
was
no
one
left
only
crimson
tuft
who
sat
by
her
side
all
through
the
silent
hours
the
next
evening
at
sunset
the
old
señora
was
buried
in
the
sea
no
one
wept
but
the
beautiful
young
maiden
as
the
steamer
went
on
leaving
in
its
wake
the
cold
lifeless
body
wrapped
in
its
shroud
of
sparkling
waters
at
length
the
good
ship
arrived
safely
in
mexico
and
crimson
tuft
took
the
proud
young
heiress
to
the
hacienda
where
a
crowd
of
friends
and
retainers
awaited
her
the
will
was
opened
and
there
was
a
large
legacy
left
to
crimson
tuft
but
it
was
as
nothing
to
him
with
so
much
ugliness
what
had
he
to
hope
for
in
the
last
paper
the
señora
had
handed
him
there
was
a
still
fuller
description
of
the
spot
where
the
treasure
was
hidden
and
a
night
appointed
for
him
to
seek
it
it
was
the
eighteenth
birthnight
of
the
donna
leota
till
then
she
was
to
be
placed
in
a
convent
and
crimson
tuft
was
to
have
the
best
tutors
in
the
city
of
mexico
this
would
make
a
man
of
him
so
the
young
people
were
separated
for
a
time
but
the
two
years
soon
rolled
by
and
crimson
tuft
returned
to
the
hacienda
with
his
papers
what
a
change
there
was
in
him
his
brown
dark
face
had
grown
every
day
more
fair
and
his
stiff
red
hair
more
soft
and
silky
and
of
a
rich
brown
color
it
was
really
wonderful
the
young
man
was
transformed
day
by
day
from
the
ugly
crimson
tuft
to
the
handsome
paul
the
donna
leota
had
become
the
beautiful
woman
that
her
childhood
promised
and
when
she
met
paul
after
the
two
years
of
separation
she
felt
that
the
great
mystery
was
solved
and
knew
that
she
could
never
love
any
one
else
so
they
were
betrothed
and
she
was
to
be
made
his
wife
on
her
eighteenth
birthday
at
the
appointed
time
paul
sought
and
found
the
great
treasure
that
had
been
hidden
for
so
long
there
were
immense
iron
pots
full
of
shining
gold
pieces
that
had
been
hidden
during
one
of
the
many
mexican
revolutions
thus
it
was
found
that
the
donna
leota
was
the
richest
maiden
in
all
mexico
and
she
had
many
suitors
among
the
wealthy
spanish
hidalgoes
but
she
cared
only
for
paul
for
the
spell
of
the
wonderful
eyes
which
had
been
crimson
tuft
s
was
upon
her
at
last
the
joyous
came
and
every
one
said
what
a
tall
handsome
señor
is
the
bridegroom
and
how
very
lovely
the
bride
the
sun
shines
upon
them
and
it
will
be
a
happy
soon
after
they
went
to
san
francisco
and
paul
felt
the
old
dream
returning
one
day
as
he
walked
through
the
he
came
to
a
vegetable
stand
behind
it
sat
a
sorrowful
woman
with
a
sad
mild
face
that
woke
the
sleeping
memories
of
his
heart
mother
he
exclaimed
with
a
thrill
of
tenderness
in
his
voice
that
raised
the
bowed
head
of
the
lonely
one
she
gave
one
look
into
the
eyes
that
once
seen
could
never
be
forgotten
and
cried
paul
my
son
my
son
and
opening
her
arms
received
upon
her
bosom
the
head
of
her
long
lost
treasure
how
she
wept
and
smiled
and
pressed
him
to
her
heart
then
held
him
off
that
she
might
gaze
upon
the
dear
handsome
face
then
they
went
home
to
the
father
who
was
old
and
sick
he
had
lost
strength
and
heart
years
ago
and
they
were
very
poor
he
has
never
held
up
his
head
so
the
mother
said
since
our
boy
was
taken
from
but
that
was
all
over
the
lost
was
found
poverty
sorrow
and
sickness
fled
with
his
presence
he
took
the
old
father
and
mother
home
to
leota
who
received
them
into
her
own
heart
for
were
they
not
his
parents
and
hers
at
first
the
old
vegetable
woman
stood
a
little
in
awe
of
her
daughter
but
that
soon
melted
away
in
the
warmth
of
the
dainty
little
señora
s
affection
and
the
father
mother
son
and
daughter
lived
all
their
lives
together
a
happy
family
united
in
heart
and
mind
by
the
silken
bonds
of
a
true
earnest
affection
snowdrop
and
rosebud
a
california
story
years
ago
before
the
came
to
california
there
lived
at
the
mission
of
san
gabriel
a
spaniard
whose
beautiful
vineyard
was
admired
by
all
the
country
in
early
life
he
had
been
a
great
traveler
and
while
in
germany
he
met
a
fair
maiden
whom
he
loved
and
married
after
a
few
years
he
emigrated
to
america
and
settled
at
the
mission
of
san
gabriel
near
the
town
of
los
angeles
there
he
prospered
greatly
his
cattle
increased
to
great
herds
covering
the
green
and
his
vineyard
was
the
pride
of
his
heart
he
built
a
pleasant
house
and
surrounded
it
with
a
garden
filled
with
all
kinds
of
fruit
in
that
delicious
climate
fruits
of
the
tropic
and
temperate
zones
grow
together
while
the
white
flowers
of
the
north
and
their
sisters
of
the
south
blossom
side
by
side
there
seemed
nothing
wanting
to
make
his
happiness
complete
but
children
the
house
was
too
silent
he
wished
for
the
silvery
laughter
of
childish
voices
he
longed
to
press
little
ones
to
his
heart
and
call
them
his
own
at
last
god
gave
him
two
little
girls
but
the
fair
mother
lived
only
to
bless
them
and
was
then
buried
by
the
clear
lake
of
the
at
first
he
was
inconsolable
and
for
months
refused
to
see
his
little
ones
but
one
day
while
he
slept
the
old
indian
nurse
took
them
into
his
room
and
laid
them
on
the
bed
by
his
side
little
snowdrop
nestled
in
his
bosom
but
rosebud
ran
her
fingers
into
his
beard
and
pulled
it
so
hard
that
she
woke
him
there
she
was
when
he
opened
his
eyes
crowing
with
delight
her
little
rosy
lips
close
to
his
and
the
fair
snowdrop
in
his
bosom
then
all
the
father
s
love
which
had
only
slept
awoke
and
he
pressed
the
little
ones
to
his
heart
weeping
but
especially
he
loved
the
beautiful
snowdrop
she
was
so
like
her
mother
after
this
although
he
still
mourned
greatly
for
his
wife
he
loved
these
little
ones
very
dearly
and
as
years
passed
by
became
happy
in
the
absorbing
devotion
to
them
which
filled
his
whole
heart
he
watched
over
them
with
the
most
jealous
care
even
in
childhood
he
would
not
allow
them
to
play
with
other
children
and
as
they
grew
older
his
fear
was
awakened
lest
some
of
the
young
señors
of
los
angeles
should
see
and
fall
in
love
with
them
for
his
daughters
to
form
a
mèsalliance
he
was
quite
sure
would
break
his
heart
as
he
was
obliged
often
to
go
from
home
on
business
he
employed
an
old
indian
woman
as
duenna
and
charged
her
never
to
allow
the
girls
out
of
her
sight
for
a
moment
rosebud
was
a
spanish
girl
with
hair
soft
black
eyes
and
clear
olive
complexion
through
the
satin
skin
the
warm
blood
flushed
her
cheeks
and
her
lips
were
more
tempting
than
ripe
cherries
but
snowdrop
was
a
rare
german
maiden
in
complexion
clear
and
fair
as
the
noonday
her
eyes
were
like
violets
her
hair
in
the
sunshine
was
like
fine
spun
gold
and
so
long
that
it
reached
to
her
feet
and
hung
like
a
mantle
of
glory
about
her
it
was
no
wonder
the
old
man
guarded
his
daughters
so
carefully
for
though
so
different
they
were
equally
beautiful
and
all
the
young
men
of
good
family
were
anxious
to
pay
court
to
them
day
by
day
they
sat
upon
the
piazza
of
the
inner
court
reading
the
fascinating
romances
of
old
spain
which
was
to
them
the
dreamland
of
delight
they
longed
very
much
to
go
out
and
see
something
of
life
among
the
rich
spanish
families
about
san
gabriel
and
los
angeles
but
their
father
would
not
allow
it
and
the
old
duenna
was
always
near
them
even
when
they
walked
through
the
vineyard
or
the
orange
orchard
she
followed
them
one
day
rosebud
called
snowdrop
into
the
garden
and
sitting
under
a
large
she
said
look
over
this
book
of
prints
with
me
while
we
talk
softly
for
the
duenna
must
not
hear
every
snowdrop
rested
her
golden
tresses
upon
her
sister
s
arm
and
turning
over
the
leaves
of
the
book
they
talked
together
sister
dear
said
rosebud
we
lead
a
very
dull
life
here
all
young
girls
are
gay
and
happy
what
is
the
use
of
being
beautiful
with
no
one
to
see
us
but
servants
and
old
women
a
look
of
conscious
beauty
gathered
around
her
pouting
lips
as
she
ran
her
dainty
fingers
through
the
silken
meshes
of
her
sister
s
golden
hair
our
dear
papa
loves
us
said
snowdrop
but
i
do
wish
to
be
loved
by
others
she
added
her
violet
eyes
softening
and
a
faint
flush
spreading
over
her
fair
cheeks
and
neck
and
i
to
be
admired
but
how
can
we
be
either
replied
rosebud
shut
up
here
with
the
old
duenna
to
watch
every
thing
we
do
god
made
us
beautiful
and
i
m
sure
he
intended
us
to
be
seen
and
for
my
part
i
am
determined
to
go
to
the
consul
s
grand
ball
if
i
have
to
run
away
and
her
pretty
dark
eyes
filled
with
tears
oh
sister
rosebud
think
of
the
dear
papa
said
snowdrop
he
did
not
tell
us
not
to
go
out
of
the
garden
alone
he
only
told
the
duenna
to
watch
us
if
we
could
only
manage
her
said
rosebud
thoughtfully
i
am
afraid
it
would
not
be
right
replied
snowdrop
but
i
want
to
go
very
much
we
will
make
an
and
embroider
it
with
gold
as
an
offering
to
the
blessed
virgin
perhaps
she
will
pity
our
loneliness
and
help
so
they
wrought
an
of
purple
and
gold
and
spread
it
upon
the
altar
before
the
picture
of
the
blessed
mother
in
their
own
chamber
putting
vases
of
beautiful
flowers
upon
it
when
it
was
finished
they
were
quite
happy
and
sat
down
with
their
guitars
and
sang
very
sweetly
together
till
their
father
came
home
the
next
morning
an
old
mexican
woman
with
baskets
of
trinkets
for
sale
knocked
at
the
garden
gate
when
she
was
admitted
she
spread
out
her
finery
before
the
young
señoritas
the
duenna
hastened
to
the
piazza
where
they
were
sitting
for
no
one
was
more
fond
of
looking
over
the
basket
than
she
always
finding
something
she
could
not
do
without
among
its
tempting
stores
this
time
it
was
a
shawl
and
she
ran
away
for
her
purse
as
soon
as
she
was
out
of
sight
the
old
woman
whispered
pretty
señoritas
i
have
charms
to
sell
this
will
make
you
admired
and
this
loved
she
said
holding
up
two
curious
little
bags
one
tied
with
long
pink
ribbon
the
other
with
blue
and
this
pointing
to
a
third
will
make
you
sleep
it
contains
a
powder
you
must
drop
one
grain
into
a
glass
of
water
it
is
perfectly
tasteless
but
it
brings
on
a
sleep
so
profound
that
until
the
effect
passes
away
nothing
could
awaken
you
from
pleasant
the
young
girls
bought
the
charms
snowdrop
took
the
one
tied
with
blue
ribbon
and
placing
it
in
her
bosom
whispered
now
i
may
be
and
i
will
be
admired
said
rosebud
taking
the
other
but
the
charm
for
sleep
she
concealed
in
her
pocket
just
as
the
old
duenna
returned
eager
for
her
purchases
i
have
pretty
slippers
for
little
dancing
feet
said
the
old
woman
holding
up
two
pairs
of
the
daintiest
white
satin
slippers
you
could
imagine
the
señoritas
have
no
use
for
them
exclaimed
the
duenna
frowning
but
the
young
girls
found
that
they
fitted
so
nicely
and
looked
so
pretty
they
bought
them
papa
is
rich
enough
to
give
us
any
thing
we
want
and
we
fancy
these
said
rosebud
they
bought
strings
of
beads
ribbons
and
combs
for
their
hair
until
the
old
duenna
was
nearly
frantic
what
they
could
want
of
all
these
shut
up
as
they
were
she
could
not
tell
then
rosebud
said
we
will
have
some
new
dresses
so
they
bought
fine
white
muslin
and
lace
snowdrop
bought
a
handkerchief
which
she
gave
the
duenna
who
was
so
much
pleased
that
she
promised
to
help
them
make
their
dresses
as
soon
as
the
old
woman
went
away
they
all
sat
upon
the
piazza
shaded
with
vines
and
commenced
cutting
and
stitching
upon
the
delicate
fabric
so
busily
that
by
evening
the
skirts
of
their
dresses
were
quite
finished
the
next
morning
they
were
early
at
work
again
why
do
you
hurry
so
much
said
the
duenna
who
never
liked
to
work
very
long
at
a
time
to
have
it
over
the
sooner
dear
duenna
answered
snowdrop
smiling
so
sweetly
that
the
duenna
took
her
needle
again
quite
pleasantly
snowdrop
s
dress
was
trimmed
with
blue
ribbon
rosebud
s
with
crimson
and
gold
the
young
girls
wrought
upon
them
all
their
pretty
fancies
till
when
they
were
finished
the
duenna
thought
them
beautiful
enough
for
a
queen
at
evening
the
work
was
all
done
and
the
duenna
quite
fatigued
with
her
unaccustomed
task
sat
dozing
in
her
suddenly
she
roused
herself
exclaiming
how
warm
it
is
i
am
very
rosebud
jumped
up
quickly
saying
i
will
bring
you
fresh
water
so
she
ran
down
to
the
spring
at
the
foot
of
the
garden
and
there
she
met
the
faithful
old
miguel
who
had
been
in
the
family
for
years
before
she
was
born
and
loved
the
young
señoritas
as
though
they
were
his
own
children
rosebud
caught
him
by
the
arm
and
whispered
have
the
horses
at
the
back
at
nine
o
clock
you
dear
old
miguel
for
you
shall
take
us
to
the
consul
s
but
the
señor
said
the
old
servant
in
astonishment
never
mind
the
señor
you
dear
careful
but
the
duenna
he
continued
never
mind
never
mind
i
tell
you
i
will
go
so
be
sure
you
are
ready
in
time
said
rosebud
laughing
and
shaking
her
finger
as
she
ran
away
poor
old
miguel
was
in
a
great
dilemma
he
loved
the
pretty
señoritas
and
wanted
to
help
them
but
he
feared
the
señor
it
may
cost
me
my
place
and
in
this
family
i
have
lived
and
here
i
would
die
but
my
pretty
children
are
so
lonely
it
is
too
bad
to
shut
them
up
and
old
miguel
will
not
fail
thus
his
fond
love
for
the
fair
girls
he
had
carried
in
his
arms
in
their
helpless
infancy
conquered
his
discretion
and
he
went
to
the
stable
to
groom
the
horses
rosebud
brought
the
water
clear
cool
and
sparkling
to
the
old
duenna
and
she
drank
it
eagerly
in
her
thirst
little
dreaming
of
the
the
gay
young
señorita
had
dropped
into
the
cup
almost
instantly
she
became
very
drowsy
and
closing
her
eyes
she
fell
asleep
in
her
chair
in
a
short
time
her
heavy
breathing
told
how
surely
the
charm
had
taken
effect
now
for
the
ball
said
rosebud
so
the
young
girls
dressed
themselves
quickly
but
with
great
care
looping
their
sleeves
with
rare
flowers
from
the
garden
and
tying
their
ribbons
very
tastefully
i
think
we
shall
do
said
rosebud
looking
at
the
beautiful
girl
reflected
from
her
mirror
then
at
the
softer
beauty
of
her
sister
snowdrop
answered
by
a
kiss
and
they
went
out
softly
and
down
the
garden
path
to
the
gate
where
the
faithful
miguel
waited
for
them
an
hour
s
ride
brought
them
to
the
brilliantly
lighted
mansion
of
the
consul
and
all
the
young
señors
were
delighted
at
the
arrival
of
the
fair
sisters
no
one
was
so
much
courted
and
admired
among
all
the
fair
señoritas
at
the
ball
that
night
as
snowdrop
and
rosebud
and
none
of
the
gay
hidalgoes
were
more
happy
than
old
miguel
who
was
peeping
from
behind
the
hall
door
enjoying
the
triumph
of
his
darlings
at
last
he
became
uneasy
and
approaching
them
with
a
respectful
bow
told
them
it
was
time
to
go
home
taking
special
leave
of
their
host
and
hostess
bowing
gracefully
to
the
guests
they
started
for
home
leaving
all
admirers
and
many
lovers
behind
them
when
they
entered
their
chamber
they
found
the
duenna
still
sleeping
soundly
they
undressed
themselves
noiselessly
putting
away
all
their
clothes
but
their
slippers
which
they
forgot
in
the
morning
when
the
sun
arose
the
duenna
awoke
and
was
much
surprised
to
find
herself
sitting
in
a
chair
instead
of
being
in
bed
she
had
but
a
confused
recollection
of
things
and
began
to
think
she
must
have
taken
a
little
more
wine
than
she
intended
at
dinner
the
day
before
she
thought
she
remembered
rosebud
giving
her
a
glass
of
water
when
she
was
very
thirsty
but
she
was
not
sure
that
it
might
not
have
been
wine
she
looked
around
but
could
discover
nothing
to
help
her
the
two
girls
were
sleeping
soundly
and
upon
the
face
of
rosebud
there
was
a
smile
she
was
dreaming
of
the
ball
again
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
admirers
snowdrop
dreamed
of
the
dear
papa
he
was
angry
with
them
for
their
disobedience
and
her
long
eyelashes
were
wet
with
tears
how
different
they
are
in
their
ways
even
in
sleep
said
the
duenna
she
turned
away
and
as
her
eye
fell
upon
the
forgotten
slippers
her
searching
glance
detected
that
they
had
been
worn
what
does
this
mean
so
much
worn
and
bought
yesterday
tis
very
strange
mused
she
and
put
them
in
her
pocket
she
woke
the
young
girls
but
they
fell
asleep
again
they
were
so
unused
to
dancing
late
at
night
that
they
were
very
tired
and
when
the
bell
rang
for
breakfast
they
did
not
appear
where
are
my
dear
daughters
said
the
father
with
a
clouded
face
she
could
only
tell
him
that
they
were
still
asleep
and
seemed
very
tired
so
are
my
horses
replied
he
angrily
but
i
will
see
about
the
duenna
was
afraid
to
show
him
the
shoes
lest
he
should
blame
her
but
in
her
confusion
as
she
drew
her
handkerchief
from
her
pocket
one
of
them
dropped
out
upon
the
floor
what
is
this
said
the
señor
sternly
and
she
was
obliged
to
tell
him
all
she
knew
for
some
time
the
troubled
father
walked
the
floor
with
great
agitation
without
speaking
while
the
duenna
stood
trembling
before
him
then
turning
to
her
quickly
he
said
call
my
daughters
and
he
rang
the
bell
for
miguel
all
three
came
into
the
room
with
fearful
hearts
but
snowdrop
s
face
was
covered
with
her
golden
hair
and
the
tears
were
shining
through
it
turning
to
miguel
he
said
sternly
with
a
black
frown
covering
his
whole
face
stand
here
and
tell
me
how
it
is
that
this
morning
i
find
my
horses
reeking
with
foam
the
old
man
only
answered
i
alone
am
to
blame
señor
pardon
your
old
servant
who
loves
you
and
yours
and
he
clasped
his
hands
and
looked
imploringly
at
the
dark
angry
face
that
frowned
upon
him
then
snowdrop
could
bear
it
no
longer
so
she
ran
to
the
father
throwing
her
white
arms
around
his
neck
and
resting
her
head
upon
his
bosom
she
said
dear
papa
i
will
tell
you
all
only
do
not
blame
dear
good
old
then
she
told
him
of
all
their
loneliness
and
eager
longings
for
companions
of
their
own
age
about
the
and
all
without
reserving
one
thing
and
now
we
are
sorry
it
was
wrong
but
the
dear
papa
will
forgive
and
she
raised
her
pretty
face
all
shining
with
tears
and
begged
him
to
kiss
her
how
like
her
mother
she
was
and
the
father
thought
of
the
sunny
days
of
his
youth
when
he
had
wandered
on
the
banks
of
the
rhine
with
the
fair
german
maiden
and
wondered
how
he
could
forget
that
the
young
and
ardent
hearts
of
his
children
must
be
like
the
heart
of
his
youth
he
kissed
the
innocent
face
upturned
to
his
and
forgave
them
saying
i
too
have
been
to
blame
and
in
future
i
will
go
with
you
to
all
places
my
darlings
where
it
is
proper
and
right
for
you
to
snowdrop
and
rosebud
were
delighted
and
willingly
promised
never
again
to
deceive
the
dear
papa
and
from
that
day
there
was
mutual
confidence
and
love
between
the
young
girls
and
the
father
after
a
time
when
two
brave
and
gallant
knights
sought
of
the
father
the
hands
of
the
fair
señoritas
in
marriage
he
answered
let
the
hearts
of
my
dear
children
decide
for
you
my
only
wish
is
to
see
them
there
was
a
great
feast
made
at
their
marriage
and
the
old
spanish
house
so
long
wrapped
in
seclusion
resounded
with
joyous
music
and
the
merry
laughter
of
light
hearts
again
old
miguel
stood
behind
the
door
and
rejoiced
to
see
his
darlings
loved
admired
and
happy
lazarus
and
bummer
it
was
a
dark
rainy
day
in
the
land
where
the
rain
makes
the
winter
and
the
sunshine
and
blue
sky
the
pleasant
through
the
golden
gate
came
the
ship
to
the
new
city
of
hope
and
all
the
people
on
board
thought
how
happy
and
rich
we
shall
become
in
the
gold
land
though
the
city
is
now
only
a
miserable
place
of
tents
and
sand
hills
one
day
how
great
it
will
be
and
we
shall
live
to
see
it
the
fair
golden
on
the
rude
wharf
stood
the
expectant
crowd
to
them
the
ship
was
the
beautiful
with
its
white
wings
spread
to
bring
them
news
of
home
perhaps
there
will
be
some
one
from
the
old
home
said
a
young
man
with
his
brown
eyes
filled
with
eager
longing
the
dark
old
atlantic
how
its
breakers
used
to
dash
upon
the
rocks
in
sight
of
home
it
was
glorious
will
be
christmas
i
wonder
will
they
remember
all
as
i
do
by
his
side
stood
a
great
shaggy
dog
who
belonged
to
nobody
he
talked
only
in
the
dog
language
but
was
very
learned
and
understood
all
the
young
man
said
he
was
a
wonderful
dog
and
had
his
thoughts
i
am
my
own
master
he
said
and
that
is
pleasant
yet
one
likes
to
be
cared
for
and
nobody
cares
for
me
i
shall
get
no
news
from
home
and
will
be
christmas
this
is
not
as
it
should
be
i
must
see
to
the
great
dog
was
getting
quite
out
of
temper
and
with
a
surly
growl
he
turned
round
so
quickly
that
he
gave
the
young
man
a
start
one
would
think
the
dog
was
mad
said
he
only
it
is
not
the
then
he
looked
out
again
hopefully
to
the
coming
ship
the
great
dog
ran
round
the
corner
and
through
the
wet
streets
all
day
the
steamer
had
arrived
and
there
were
new
faces
looking
eagerly
about
for
old
familiar
ones
and
the
old
were
looking
for
the
new
so
there
was
altogether
a
great
bustle
such
as
was
never
seen
only
in
those
early
days
when
the
ships
came
in
from
home
thus
the
day
passed
and
the
evening
came
on
raining
dismally
yet
it
was
christmas
eve
in
a
dark
alley
sat
the
great
dog
his
shaggy
coat
kept
him
warm
yet
it
was
very
desolate
there
alone
one
should
have
something
to
live
for
growled
he
something
to
take
care
of
and
protect
or
there
is
no
use
in
being
strong
and
brave
one
might
as
well
be
a
puny
poodle
and
sit
by
the
parlor
fire
and
he
gave
an
ugly
bark
bow
wow
wow
one
should
have
an
object
in
just
then
he
heard
a
low
moan
and
looking
round
he
saw
a
poor
lame
dog
very
thin
and
sick
lying
down
in
the
mud
and
ready
to
die
of
hunger
it
was
really
quite
wretched
and
all
the
great
dog
s
sympathies
were
aroused
there
an
object
to
be
sure
he
said
it
is
christmas
eve
and
the
good
santa
claus
has
taken
pity
on
me
and
given
me
this
poor
fellow
who
needs
me
as
much
as
i
do
him
what
a
zest
life
has
when
one
has
something
to
live
without
any
useless
ceremony
he
raised
the
poor
dog
and
tenderly
as
the
mother
dog
carries
her
little
ones
he
bore
him
to
a
warm
dry
place
and
made
him
a
nice
bed
of
clean
straw
this
is
better
my
friend
said
the
noble
creature
quite
flushed
and
happy
with
the
pleasure
of
doing
a
kind
act
what
more
can
i
do
for
you
i
am
famishing
with
hunger
replied
the
lame
dog
with
a
feeble
groan
and
off
went
his
great
shaggy
protector
through
rain
and
mud
to
a
restaurant
and
there
the
cook
gave
him
a
bone
saying
take
it
you
he
caught
the
bone
and
running
off
as
fast
as
possible
in
a
few
moments
laid
it
before
the
lame
dog
it
was
a
rich
bone
and
had
a
delicious
smell
that
was
quite
reviving
to
the
sick
one
it
was
so
pleasant
to
see
the
poor
hungry
fellow
eat
that
bummer
could
not
leave
him
until
he
had
finished
i
never
enjoyed
a
bone
so
much
in
my
life
said
bummer
as
he
tucked
the
warm
straw
around
his
new
friend
and
saw
him
closing
his
eyes
with
a
pleasant
satisfied
languor
this
is
something
like
living
added
he
with
a
lively
bark
as
he
ran
back
to
the
restaurant
for
his
own
dinner
coming
again
bummer
said
the
jolly
cook
throwing
him
another
bone
which
he
ate
with
a
famous
relish
in
the
morning
he
went
back
again
to
the
restaurant
serving
the
sick
dog
first
and
again
at
night
and
day
after
day
till
he
became
the
jolly
cook
s
regular
pensioner
at
the
restaurant
they
grew
quite
curious
to
know
what
became
of
the
first
bone
and
sent
some
one
to
follow
bummer
who
came
back
telling
the
strange
story
and
saying
it
is
really
quite
then
every
one
talked
of
it
and
soon
the
whole
town
came
to
know
the
two
dogs
and
called
them
bummer
and
lazarus
in
the
pleasant
days
they
walked
out
together
bummer
always
watching
over
lazarus
with
the
tenderest
care
it
was
really
a
pleasant
sight
to
see
them
they
were
so
happy
together
thus
time
passed
away
making
no
change
in
the
protecting
devotion
of
bummer
nor
the
trusting
love
of
lazarus
but
there
must
be
an
end
of
all
things
and
at
last
lazarus
died
this
was
a
great
sorrow
to
poor
bummer
and
he
grew
so
thin
and
wretched
that
the
jolly
cook
was
quite
distressed
you
must
cheer
up
my
good
bummer
really
it
will
never
do
you
cheer
it
is
all
over
now
said
the
dog
one
must
have
something
to
live
for
it
is
no
use
one
must
have
an
he
was
no
longer
the
bummer
of
old
and
he
went
away
to
the
place
where
lazarus
rested
he
forgot
to
eat
his
bone
said
the
jolly
cook
poor
fellow
we
were
getting
used
to
him
and
we
shall
miss
him
he
belonged
to
the
town
he
was
our
this
was
the
last
time
he
went
for
his
bone
it
was
all
over
and
bummer
and
lazarus
became
a
remembrance
which
has
passed
into
a
tradition
the
skin
of
bummer
was
carefully
stuffed
and
placed
in
a
glass
case
it
may
still
be
seen
in
some
restaurant
on
montgomery
street
where
it
is
preserved
as
a
precious
relic
of
the
olden
time
this
is
a
true
story
little
ones
and
no
doubt
the
fathers
will
tell
you
how
in
the
olden
days
he
has
often
seen
bummer
and
lazarus
