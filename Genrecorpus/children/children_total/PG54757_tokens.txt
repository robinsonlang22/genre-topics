preliminary
chapter
mutability
is
the
appropriate
motto
of
humanity
for
what
are
men
but
creatures
of
a
day
monarchs
but
transient
shadows
of
earthly
greatness
empires
but
passing
events
time
with
more
than
eagle
swiftness
hurls
all
things
into
the
great
bosom
of
eternity
futurity
is
dark
and
impenetrable
but
the
present
is
with
us
and
still
more
the
past
teeming
with
vast
records
of
human
life
of
rising
and
falling
empires
bloody
tales
of
extinguished
armies
and
extirpated
races
of
mankind
detailing
the
effects
of
the
wild
ambition
of
kings
emperors
sultans
themselves
but
atoms
yet
involving
the
whole
mass
in
their
career
contrast
is
often
the
greatest
source
of
pleasure
to
the
mind
therefore
do
the
citizens
of
this
new
world
delight
to
revel
in
the
scenes
of
the
olden
hemisphere
which
was
in
full
glory
when
this
vast
continent
lay
in
undiscovered
obscurity
orientalism
talisman
to
conjure
up
the
shades
of
the
very
parents
of
our
race
and
of
the
old
patriarchs
of
israel
to
array
in
picturesque
and
savage
beauty
the
vision
of
arabian
horsemen
flying
steeds
vast
encampments
on
arid
plains
tribes
of
wandering
tartars
and
almost
to
awaken
the
echoes
of
the
clashing
and
scimitars
of
the
desperate
champions
of
the
crescent
the
followers
of
the
prophet
and
while
there
is
a
wall
of
iron
between
us
and
our
future
the
eventful
record
of
times
displays
to
us
the
development
of
all
that
was
hidden
to
our
ancestors
there
is
a
great
difference
between
the
primitive
condition
of
the
human
race
and
the
effects
which
time
has
produced
upon
that
wonderful
structure
man
simplicity
almost
childlike
seems
to
characterize
the
living
mind
of
man
in
its
embryo
state
while
years
of
successive
have
continued
to
develop
this
noble
emanation
from
the
great
spirit
of
the
universe
but
how
deeply
interesting
to
us
who
are
the
embodiment
of
the
more
mature
and
experienced
human
wisdom
to
look
into
the
vast
womb
of
the
past
and
trace
the
growth
of
the
great
human
foetus
the
impress
of
the
original
condition
of
our
race
is
yet
upon
the
nations
of
the
east
and
wonderfully
do
they
still
retain
the
habits
and
ideas
of
the
earliest
ages
how
vividly
are
the
scenes
of
biblical
record
exemplified
in
the
habits
of
the
people
who
at
the
present
time
dwell
in
those
venerated
countries
the
patriarchal
family
government
the
flowing
robes
even
the
very
style
of
garment
of
which
it
is
recorded
they
parted
my
raiment
and
upon
my
vesture
they
cast
lots
are
one
and
all
in
daily
use
in
the
east
our
attention
is
peculiarly
directed
to
the
history
of
former
ages
and
the
progress
of
different
empires
by
the
events
which
mark
the
present
course
of
time
for
the
great
theme
of
the
day
is
the
past
and
future
of
turkey
the
very
garden
of
the
east
and
the
desired
of
all
nations
upon
whose
shores
has
lately
been
poured
the
of
thousands
of
valiant
heroes
each
and
all
members
of
the
vast
human
family
whether
known
to
us
as
turks
russians
english
or
french
there
is
an
indefinable
charm
about
all
that
relates
to
this
land
of
the
orient
the
position
by
nature
the
variety
of
scenery
hill
valley
and
undulating
plain
the
great
streams
which
water
its
shores
and
the
rich
productions
of
the
soil
the
ancient
capital
proudly
towering
from
its
verdant
hills
the
key
to
two
continents
with
the
ocean
stream
for
a
highway
the
lovers
of
classic
lore
delight
to
realize
the
existence
of
ancient
heroes
and
the
very
homes
of
the
demigods
as
they
tread
its
honored
shores
romance
seems
to
be
merged
in
reality
as
the
robed
and
turbaned
moslem
with
stately
step
and
meditative
countenance
passes
beneath
your
latticed
casement
or
the
veiled
lady
and
sable
eunuch
with
mysterious
silence
stealthily
glide
along
sultans
vezirs
pashas
grand
muftis
sultanas
harems
and
slaves
intriguing
ulema
and
judges
so
long
enveloped
in
the
mist
of
fancy
are
in
modern
days
to
emerge
into
the
sunlight
of
truth
and
civilization
and
exhibit
to
the
study
of
philanthropy
only
the
type
of
ancient
usages
and
the
actual
scenes
of
everyday
life
amid
the
votaries
to
superstition
and
fanaticism
side
by
side
with
the
banner
of
the
cross
the
followers
of
the
prophet
with
the
crescent
of
the
faithful
will
henceforth
march
through
time
into
eternity
but
known
and
read
of
all
men
the
door
to
the
east
stands
open
and
we
may
pass
within
the
portal
to
study
men
and
manners
with
their
institutions
both
social
and
political
many
attempts
have
been
made
to
portray
the
actual
and
past
condition
of
this
oriental
empire
and
as
various
have
been
the
lights
and
shadows
in
which
it
has
been
pictured
some
making
the
osmanli
a
paragon
of
humanity
and
others
again
reducing
him
to
a
mere
polypus
on
legs
if
those
who
are
resident
among
us
observes
the
editor
of
the
new
york
herald
can
not
after
the
lapse
of
years
always
succeed
in
identifying
themselves
with
our
ideas
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
writers
at
a
distance
should
be
able
to
form
a
fair
estimate
of
american
society
from
such
imperfect
evidences
as
they
have
before
them
we
have
seen
how
few
foreign
tourists
have
penetrated
below
the
surface
of
things
in
their
analysis
of
our
social
and
political
life
if
these
strictures
of
the
herald
are
just
and
true
with
reference
to
american
and
european
countries
in
general
where
there
is
such
similarity
how
much
more
applicable
to
our
oriental
clime
for
considering
the
peculiar
form
of
government
and
construction
of
society
in
turkey
based
as
they
are
upon
the
koran
traditional
customs
and
oriental
conventionalities
hitherto
so
inaccessible
as
well
as
incomprehensible
to
strangers
it
is
indeed
no
matter
of
wonder
that
such
heterogeneous
portraits
of
eastern
men
and
manners
have
been
promulgated
to
the
world
by
travellers
and
bibliomanists
language
is
the
great
vehicle
of
ideas
the
bond
of
man
with
man
the
open
sesame
to
the
spirit
of
every
community
the
record
of
the
past
the
exponent
of
the
present
and
the
foreteller
of
the
future
but
how
few
even
of
modern
savans
have
acquired
a
knowledge
of
the
oriental
dialects
which
are
never
used
in
europe
and
only
called
into
exercise
by
researches
into
ancient
chronicles
even
many
who
have
long
resided
in
the
east
and
whose
daily
and
hourly
contact
with
the
inhabitants
would
seem
to
demand
a
mutual
understanding
have
lived
and
died
in
a
stoical
adherence
to
their
own
mother
tongues
a
french
merchant
mons
who
had
enjoyed
the
advantages
of
commerce
in
the
east
for
years
may
be
quoted
as
an
example
either
considering
his
own
superior
civilization
compromised
by
such
a
condescension
to
barbarism
or
unable
to
train
his
exclusively
french
organs
to
any
other
guise
of
speech
mons
b
ideas
and
expressions
were
always
in
his
mother
tongue
when
therefore
on
a
certain
occasion
his
turkish
porter
excited
his
displeasure
he
poured
out
his
indignation
in
pure
gallic
which
lost
much
of
its
intended
effect
upon
his
employé
who
could
not
imagine
the
cause
of
his
master
agitation
and
vehemence
and
ventured
to
ask
an
explanation
of
a
bystander
what
said
the
irritated
frenchman
does
the
stupid
fellow
mean
to
say
that
having
been
with
me
for
the
past
years
he
does
not
yet
understand
french
mashallah
responded
the
astonished
turk
my
master
who
has
been
here
so
long
a
time
why
can
he
not
scold
me
in
turkish
emergencies
are
constantly
occurring
and
as
interpreters
can
not
be
omnipresent
ridiculous
misunderstandings
are
often
the
results
the
complacent
french
and
english
seem
to
think
their
respective
languages
universal
and
upon
their
arrival
in
the
east
address
the
people
accordingly
who
can
only
look
and
listen
and
strain
their
senses
for
one
familiar
word
or
phrase
sometimes
the
simplest
expression
through
some
euphonious
resemblance
may
convey
an
opposite
meaning
or
even
a
flattering
compliment
be
mistaken
for
a
victimizing
oath
a
party
of
french
naval
officers
one
day
visited
the
shoe
bazaar
and
were
attracted
by
the
beauty
of
the
collection
of
a
certain
merchant
the
author
happening
to
be
present
officiated
as
interpreter
for
them
and
advised
the
merchant
to
display
all
his
best
specimens
of
embroidered
slippers
so
that
the
gentlemen
soon
had
an
innumerable
variety
before
them
but
one
of
them
yet
unsatisfied
with
a
spirit
of
independence
took
a
slipper
in
his
hand
and
showing
it
to
the
merchant
said
beaucoup
mieux
beaucoup
mieux
efendi
the
grave
merchant
instead
of
replying
turned
all
of
a
sudden
pale
with
rage
and
gathering
up
his
embroidered
wares
mercilessly
consigned
them
to
the
recesses
of
his
shop
and
bestowing
upon
these
insolent
giavours
a
most
genuine
turkish
benediction
ordered
them
to
quit
his
premises
instanter
bewildered
at
the
singular
conduct
of
the
merchant
i
inquired
as
to
the
cause
of
his
sudden
irritation
what
did
you
not
hear
the
impudent
rascal
say
said
the
enraged
turk
an
expression
too
unfit
for
ears
polite
to
be
translated
into
english
though
sometimes
heard
in
the
purlieus
of
the
five
points
i
attempted
to
explain
but
in
vain
the
turkish
was
unmistakable
so
thought
the
who
insisted
that
they
had
at
least
learned
that
much
of
the
language
of
the
country
thus
with
entire
ignorance
of
the
language
thoroughly
impregnated
with
the
prejudices
of
a
european
education
the
foreigner
looks
only
upon
the
surface
of
things
and
comprehends
nothing
where
the
simplest
habits
of
life
and
etiquette
are
diametrically
opposed
to
his
preconceived
ideas
the
osmanli
would
stare
with
astonishment
at
the
presumption
with
which
a
frank
uncovered
his
head
in
his
august
presence
while
the
exquisite
of
the
would
be
lost
in
wonder
to
see
his
oriental
rival
enter
his
presence
without
shoes
and
seat
himself
on
the
sofa
with
his
feet
carefully
concealed
beneath
him
thus
only
conforming
to
the
ancient
etiquettes
of
the
bible
for
moses
was
not
commanded
to
uncover
his
head
but
to
put
off
his
shoes
at
least
some
of
the
oriental
forms
of
politeness
have
antiquity
as
their
origin
and
the
sanction
of
many
generations
but
for
the
varying
code
of
western
manners
where
can
we
look
save
to
the
capricious
tastes
of
the
passing
times
thus
are
the
simplest
habits
of
life
reversed
and
what
is
excessive
rudeness
to
the
one
may
be
the
essence
of
politeness
to
the
other
very
frequently
these
contrary
customs
are
the
source
of
ludicrous
mistakes
as
we
were
walking
one
day
with
a
friend
a
sailor
from
the
english
fleet
accidentally
dropped
his
the
gentleman
regretting
that
the
worthy
tar
should
meet
with
such
a
loss
hailed
him
at
the
same
time
beckoning
with
his
hand
à
la
turque
which
is
done
by
extending
the
arm
and
moving
the
fingers
with
the
palm
downwards
or
just
in
the
same
manner
as
would
here
be
done
to
imply
a
more
distant
removal
a
police
officer
happening
to
be
at
no
great
distance
the
sailor
on
looking
back
understood
quite
naturally
my
friend
movement
as
a
signal
for
him
to
make
his
escape
and
accordingly
took
to
his
heels
with
the
greatest
rapidity
leaving
my
companion
in
utter
amazement
i
endeavored
to
explain
to
him
the
reason
of
the
sailor
conduct
by
showing
him
the
genuine
european
style
of
beckoning
by
reversing
the
hand
and
moving
the
forefinger
back
and
forth
this
astonished
him
the
more
since
that
motion
is
equivalent
in
turkey
to
that
comical
american
gesture
of
placing
the
thumb
on
the
tip
end
of
the
nose
and
extending
the
fingers
thus
things
which
are
in
themselves
trifles
may
lead
or
mislead
to
mighty
results
and
can
only
be
appreciated
when
circumstances
call
them
into
action
therefore
nothing
but
actual
nativity
and
education
among
the
people
with
the
enlarged
views
which
are
acquired
by
a
residence
in
european
countries
can
enable
an
individual
to
judge
and
appreciate
the
peculiar
institutions
of
turkey
the
author
presents
himself
to
the
american
public
a
native
of
constantinople
and
of
armenian
parentage
with
the
hope
that
he
may
be
able
to
unfold
some
new
phases
of
turkey
and
orientalism
which
may
tend
to
remove
any
unfounded
prejudices
and
enlighten
their
minds
with
regard
to
the
real
and
existing
state
of
his
country
in
order
to
attain
a
just
and
correct
idea
of
the
present
state
of
turkey
and
its
probable
future
it
is
most
essential
to
take
a
cursory
glance
at
the
origin
of
the
nation
its
religion
government
civil
laws
social
condition
and
domestic
relations
which
are
the
elements
of
nationality
in
so
doing
the
writer
has
carefully
avoided
all
partiality
and
endeavored
to
display
the
truth
simply
and
nothing
but
the
truth
invested
with
the
garb
of
a
peculiar
nationality
and
only
adorned
with
the
poetry
of
oriental
tastes
and
habits
as
they
actually
exist

origin

turkish
and
eastern
proverbs
have
often
a
deep
and
significative
meaning
under
a
simple
simile
they
say
a
neighbor
chicken
has
always
so
unreal
a
magnitude
in
covetous
eyes
that
it
swells
in
its
proportions
even
to
the
size
of
a
goose
human
nature
has
in
reality
undergone
but
few
changes
since
it
descended
upon
this
planet
the
simplest
shepherds
and
the
richest
sovereigns
have
been
alike
swayed
by
the
demon
of
envy
the
earth
no
sooner
became
the
inheritance
of
man
than
its
treasures
excited
the
desire
of
appropriation
in
his
breast

thine
were
the
earliest
appellatives
between
man
and
his
brother
nature
provided
a
perpetual
feast
to
their
physical
wants
in
her
luxuriant
offerings
ready
for
use
without
toil
or
labor
the
flocks
of
the
early
pastoral
days
wandered
from
field
to
field
along
with
their
shepherd
kings
ample
was
the
territory
as
they
forsook
the
soil
when
winter
chilled
and
roamed
to
summer
climes
exempt
from
care
simple
in
their
tastes
they
grew
and
multiplied
until
they
became
mighty
nations
but
the
monarchs
of
the
animal
world
the
kings
of
the
forests
could
not
brook
any
inroads
upon
their
dominions
and
awoke
man
ingenuity
and
armed
him
with
the
the
unerring
stone

thus
trained
in

and
the
stronger
prevailed
in
the
usurpation
of
coveted
territories
thus
war
in
the
absence
of
the
arts
of
modern
civilization
became
the
sole
aim
of
these
wandering
tribes
alliances
were
sometimes
formed
for
mutual
protection
and
territories
were
ever
changing
masters
the
primitive
belief
that
the
soil
was
common
property
and
that
occupancy
gave
the
only
title
to
possession
induced
them
to
trespass
upon
the
neighboring
territories
this
same
principle
exists
even
at
this
present
day
among
some
of
the
people
of
the
east
of
whom
the
tribe
of
yürücks
is
well
known
in
turkey
traversing
the
whole
dominion
of
asia
minor
according
to
the
climate
they
desire
to
find
passing
by
the
days
of
biblical
history
and
the
ancient
pedigree
of
the
arabians
we
will
observe
the
first
appearance
of
the
turks
on
the
pages
of
history
as
early
as
the
ninth
century
a
small
but
adventurous
band
of
scythians
known
as
the
turkomans
impelled
either
by
famine
or
hostility
crossed
the
caspian
mountains
and
invaded
the
armenian
territories
although
they
were
bravely
repulsed
still
the
prosperous
condition
of
the
country
was
too
alluring
for
them
to
give
up
all
hope
of
its
ultimate
conquest
they
therefore
continued
to
harass
the
inhabitants
by
their
incessant
incursions
in
the
middle
of
the
eleventh
century
a
vigorous
attempt
was
made
under
the
command
of
toghrul
bey
a
grandson
of
seljuk
one
of
the
principal
families
of
tartary
with
an
army
of
one
hundred
thousand
men
who
ravaged
of
its
provinces
toghrul
already
so
distinguished
by
his
valor
now
embraced
islamism
and
thus
added
to
the
thirst
of
conquest
the
ardor
of
the
religion
of
the
prophet
another
more
desperate
sally
was
made
with
redoubled
force
which
met
with
similar
discomfiture
fourteen
years
after
the
infuriated
tartars
collecting
an
army
of
no
less
than
three
hundred
thousand
men
renewed
their
assaults
armenia
was
at
this
time
not
only
harassed
on
all
sides
by
greeks
saracens
and
persians
but
rent
by
the
internal
dissensions
of
its
own
princes
so
that
it
now
fell
a
prey
to
toghrul
who
massacred
in
cold
blood
of
the
inhabitants
carrying
many
also
into
captivity
the
most
flourishing
provinces
in
due
time
were
added
to
the
conquests
of
the
turkomans
by
the
nephew
and
successor
of
toghrul
their
empire
was
greatly
extended
by
the
son
of
and
was
subsequently
divided
among
three
branches
of
the
house
of
seljuk
suleyman
the
third
in
descent
from
was
the
first
turkoman
prince
who
governed
asia
minor
or
orthogrul
the
son
of
suleyman
having
by
his
assistance
on
a
certain
occasion
secured
a
victory
to
the
sultan
of
babylon
in
bithynia
was
bestowed
upon
him
and
there
he
settled
with
his
family
which
consisted
of
three
sons
osman
the
eldest
son
and
successor
of
his
father
orthogrul
was
left
by
the
death
of
the
ally
of
his
father
without
a
rival
in
the
government
of
syria
he
was
accordingly
proclaimed
sultan
in
the
year
he
made
neapolis
the
capital
of
his
dominions
and
from
thence
is
dated
the
foundation
of
the
present
ottoman
empire
osman
was
so
distinguished
by
his
conquests
and
became
so
endeared
to
his
subjects
that
ever
since
his
time
the
appellation
of
osmanlis
has
been
adopted
by
them
and
the
word
türk
or
turk
so
indiscriminately
applied
to
them
by
the
europeans
is
not
only
inappropriate
but
of
a
disagreeable
signification
for
it
is
only
used
among
themselves
as
an
epithet
of
opprobrium
in
the
year
of
his
reign
osman
took
the
city
of
broossa
in
asia
minor
which
his
son
orkhan
who
succeeded
him
made
the
capital
of
his
dominions
the
desire
however
to
possess
the
city
of
stamboul
was
transferred
with
increasing
ardor
from
sultan
to
sultan
but
the
glory
of
its
conquest
was
reserved
for
mohammed
ii
the
effeminate
condition
of
the
greeks
favored
his
design
for
out
of
a
population
of
men
there
were
scarcely
ready
to
defend
their
capital
and
on
the
of
may
constantinople
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
osmanlis
or
descendants
of
osman
who
have
held
it
in
possession
until
the
present
day
it
is
evident
that
the
osmanlis
are
the
descendants
of
the
scythians
or
one
of
the
tartar
tribes
but
who
those
scythians
originally
were
may
be
questioned
a
very
curious
but
plausible
theory
is
advanced
by
some
persons
that
the
tartars
are
of
the
jewish
race
or
tartar
in
the
syrian
language
signifies
the
remnant
of
a
people
now
in
the
second
book
of
kings
it
is
recorded
that
the
king
of
assyria
took
samaria
and
carried
israel
away
into
assyria
and
placed
them
in
halah
and
habor
by
the
river
of
gozan
in
the
cities
of
the
medes
this
was
about
years
before
christ
medea
is
situated
near
the
caspian
sea
possessed
entirely
by
these
tartars
the
names
which
are
given
to
their
principal
cities
are
the
same
as
were
common
among
the
jews
for
instance
the
capital
of
tartary
is
called
semerkand
which
is
a
corruption
of
samaryan
very
similar
to
samaria
there
are
moreover
many
relics
of
antiquity
in
this
city
which
bear
undeniable
evidences
of
having
been
jewish
monuments
they
have
also
another
town
called
jericho
a
mount
sion
and
a
mount
tabor
with
a
river
yordon
or
jordan
they
are
divided
into
ten
tribes
bearing
names
similar
to
the
ancient
patriarchs
of
israel
they
are
under
one
government
but
avoid
all
intermarriages
which
was
also
a
peculiar
observance
of
the
jews
there
is
also
a
great
similarity
between
the
tartar
and
the
hebrew
languages
the
degeneracy
of
their
language
may
be
attributed
to
the
fact
that
they
were
long
captives
in
a
strange
land
and
removed
from
all
intercourse
with
more
enlightened
nations
the
tartars
have
even
been
known
to
observe
the
jewish
rites
of
worship
and
circumcision
and
they
traditionally
boast
themselves
to
be
descended
from
those
israelites
who
conquering
their
conquerors
became
possessed
of
all
the
territories
by
the
caspian
sea
indeed
or
tamerlane
the
great
is
said
to
have
proudly
asserted
that
he
was
descended
in
a
direct
line
from
the
tribe
of
dan
from
these
facts
it
seems
very
probable
that
the
people
known
as
the
tartars
are
the
ten
lost
tribes
of
the
jews
and
it
is
historically
certain
that
the
founders
of
the
present
turkish
empire
are
descendants
of
these
tartars
chapter
iii
religion
five
hundred
and
years
after
christ
mohammed
the
prophet
was
born
at
mecca
where
his
immediate
ancestors
had
for
many
years
enjoyed
a
sort
of
regal
and
priestly
authority
over
the
caaba
or
temple
of
the
arabians
which
for
at
least
seven
hundred
years
had
been
the
shrine
of
adoration
for
the
worshippers
of
the
sun
moon
and
stars
his
family
was
considered
the
most
illustrious
among
the
tribes
of
the
arabs
so
that
he
was
born
to
distinction
the
early
loss
of
his
parents
left
him
an
orphan
under
the
care
of
his
uncle
who
paid
little
attention
to
his
nephew
at
the
early
age
of
twelve
years
he
was
initiated
into
the
mysteries
of
eastern
commerce
as
he
journeyed
with
his
uncle
through
syria
to
bassora
and
damascus
but
the
contemplative
mind
of
this
youth
destined
to
become
the
prophet
of
his
country
gathered
into
its
fructifying
soil
the
tenets
of
the
religious
faith
of
the
christians
which
were
more
congenial
to
his
spirit
than
the
idolatries
of
his
own
people
the
arabs
too
were
anticipating
the
birth
of
a
messiah
of
their
own
who
was
to
descend
from
the
sacred
guardians
of
the
caaba
so
that
circumstances
seemed
to
point
out
to
the
precocious
youth
this
road
to
greatness
well
born
of
insinuating
manners
and
graceful
address
noble
and
majestic
in
appearance
mohammed
became
the
object
of
affection
to
the
wealthy
widow
khatijeh
who
married
him
and
thus
riches
were
added
to
his
facilities
the
great
crowd
of
pilgrims
who
assembled
in
mecca
afforded
the
prophet
constant
occasions
for
the
discussion
of
various
systems
of
religious
faith
until
mohammed
resolved
to
announce
himself
as
the
completion
of
the
revelation
of
god
to
the
jews
and
christians
the
predicted
by
moses
and
christ
who
coming
after
them
should
be
the
greatest
of
all
the
prophets
to
the
idolatrous
arabs
he
proclaimed
one
god
omnipotent
and
imperishable
to
the
christians
he
revived
the
unity
of
their
maker
and
recalled
to
the
jews
the
jehovah
whose
worship
they
had
so
corrupted
the
confusion
of
the
asiatic
states
rent
with
wars
tumults
and
heresies
wonderfully
favored
the
spread
of
mohammedanism
even
beyond
the
warmest
anticipations
of
the
prophet
arming
himself
with
the
sword
and
promising
the
joys
of
paradise
to
every
soldier
of
the
crescent
who
should
die
on

wonderful
prodigy

the
compendium
of
the
faith

and
civil

of
mussulmans
ingeniously
compiled
by

great

prophet

styled
by
the
faithful

the

origin
of

of
david
and
the
four
gospels
and
upon
these
books
with
the
koran
their
oaths
are
taken
the
koran
declares
verily
the
true
religion
in
the
sight
of
god
is
islam
which
is
the
proper
name
of
the
mohammedan
faith

it

writings
supposed
to
have
been
miraculously
conceived
by
the
virgin
mary
but
not
of

origin
the
crucifixion
they
regard
as
inconsistent
with
the
justice
of
god
to
yield
up
so
mighty
a
prophet
endowed
with
power
to
work
miracles
and
raise
the
dead
a
victim
to
the
unbelieving
jews
they
deem
incompatible
with

supremacy

even
say
that
when

out

die

fatalism
is
a
characteristic
item
in

mohammedan
creed
they
believe
that
whatever
happens
is
by
the
omniscient
which
article
of
faith
is
designated
kader
or
predestination
but
the
doctrine
of
the
or
the
lesser
will
is
also
in
their
creed
hence
every
one
is
bound
to
exert
himself
to
his
utmost
and
it
is
only
when
he
fails
that
he
resigns
himself
calmly
and
philosophically
to
his
disappointment
saying
kader
or
it
is
my
fate
the
following
legend
may
perhaps
serve
to
illustrate
the
spirit
of
oriental
fatalism
across
the
bosphorus
and
between
seraglio
point
and
scutari
in
asia
is
the
renowned
or
the
maiden

it
was
predicted
that
the
beautiful
daughter
of
a
certain
sultan
would
meet
with
an
early
death
from
the
bite
of
a
serpent
contrary
to
prediction
her
father
hoped
to
avert
her
fate
by
placing
her
in
a
situation
inaccessible
to
those
reptiles
as
he
revolved
the
subject
in
his
mind
from
the
windows
of
the
seraglio
his
eye
rested
on
the
rock
in
the
stream
where
he
immediately
ordered
a
tower
to
be
erected
and
thither
the
unhappy
princess
was
conveyed
and
immured
in
her
island
home

fruitful
in

for
its

destined
to
furnish
the

which
poisoned
the

of
the
beautiful

for
a

of
scutari
grapes
concealed
the
viper
which
was
the
instrument
in
the
hand
of
fate
and
the
fulfillment
of
the
prophecy
it
is
doubtless
in
the
recollection
of
many
of
the
citizens
of
new
york
that
a
short
time
ago
an
individual
passing
by
wallack
theatre
was
suddenly
killed
by
the
falling
of
the
from
the
top
of

building
this
sad
occurrence
was
not
the
result
of
carelessness
or
temerity

purely
accidental
and
would
also
be
termed
in

accident
yet
why
the
accident
should
have
happened
to
this
individual
more
than
to
any
other
of

of
persons
who
passed
the
same
spot
mohammedan
doctrine
would
simply
answer
it
was
his
kader
or
predestination
to
mourn
therefore
for
the
dead
or
complain
against
misfortune
would
by
them
be
esteemed
a
grievous
sin
as
though
censuring
the
almighty
without
whose
knowledge
not
a
sparrow
falleth
to
the
ground
it
is
not
fatalism
that
makes
the
mohammedan
indifferent
to
casualties
but
his
exaggerated
and
misconceived
ideas
of
his
religious
obligations
for
human
imperfectibility
is
as
prominent
an
article
of
their
creed
as
fatalism
and
even
induces
a
disposition
to
avoid
either
intellectually
or
externally
perfection
being
the
attribute
of
the
deity
it
is
unbecoming
in
his
creatures
to
assert
in
any
form
whatever
their
capabilities
of
approximation
to
such
a
condition
while
then
their
minds
repose
in
the
simplicity
of
innate
ideas
they
even
seek
imperfection
in
the
investiture
of
their
bodies
they
will
rend
their
garments
so
as
to
mar
their
completeness
assume
an
air
of
general
slovenliness
or
studiously
clip
the
corner
of
a
sheet
of
paper
to
destroy
its
regular
uniformity
it
is
then
most
erroneous
to
suppose
that
the
doctrine
of
fatalism
is
so
antagonistic
to
civilization
in
the
east
as
it
implies
resignation
to
the
divine
will
and
by
no
means
impedes
active
personal
exertion
but
in
reality
it
is
the
seeming
propriety
of
human
imperfection
in
contradistinction
to
the
divine
excellence
which
has
hitherto
maintained
a
spirit
of
indifference
to
progressive
improvement
while
an
entire
submission
to
the
course
of
events
as
preordained
and
predestined
by
the
omniscient
prevents
all
restless
anxiety
and
calms
the
repinings
of
the
and
weary
this
more
truly
fatal
and
false
notion
of
inferiority
only
leaves
the
immortal
mind
in
a
sort
of
embryo
state
lest
perchance
there
should
be
any
assimilation
to
the
great
supreme
essence
from
which
it
is
but
an
emanation
or
the

should
glow
with
the
brightness
of
the

which

chapter
iv
sectarianism
besides
the
koran
there
are
other
sacred
and
traditional
books
called
the
sonnah
the
productions
of
abubekir
omer
and
osman
the
successors
of
the
prophet
the
ancient
caliphs
of
egypt
and
babylon
have
also
added
their
own
these
books
have
numerous
commentaries
upon
them
which
constitute
the
principal
part
of
the
mohammedan
literature
and
have
been
the
source
of
much
dissension
sectarianism
therefore
prevails
among
the
mussulmans
as
in
every
part
of
the
world
we
will
only
mention
those
sects
with
whom
the
traveller
in
the
east
is
apt
to
come
in
contact
the
principal
schism
which
divides
the
mohammedan
nation
is
that
of
the
sünnees
and
the
sheyees
the
sünnees
are
the
orthodox
party
and
believe
in
the
traditions
attributed
to
the
prophet
and
his
successors
and
are
strict
in
all
their
observances
whereas
the
sheyees
reject
all
traditions
and
are
strict
legitimists
adhering
to
aali
who
married
the
daughter
as
the
rightful
successor
and
rendering
their
homage
to
his
descendants
the
turks
are
all
sünnees
and
the
persians
sheyees
the
one
is
more
fanatical
the
other
more
superstitious
and
as
the
difference
between
them
is
small
so
is
their
mutual
hatred
proportionably
intense
the
sünnees
repudiate
aali
the
infallible
director
of
the
sheyees
who
in
their
turn
decapitate
the
representatives
of
the
prophet
abubekir
omer
and
osman
in
effigy
for
they
erect
these
persons
in
sugar
at
their
festivals
and
when
merry
over
their
wine
cut
the
respected
friends
of
mohammed
into
pieces
and
actually
drink
them
in
solution
the
turks
elevate
the
sacred
color
green
to
their
heads
and
turbans
with
the
greatest
respect
but
in
contradistinction
the
persians
choose
this
hue
for
their
shoes
trowsers
and
every
other
disrespectful
use
their
ingenuity
can
devise
when
the
one
shaves
the
other
does
not
and
scorns
the
thorough
ablutions
of
his
rival
indeed
no
matter
how
or
what
so
it
be
vice
versâ
most
ingenious
and
vituperative
are
their
mutual
curses
may
your
fatigued
and
hated
soul
when
damned
to
berzak
purgatory
find
no
more
rest
than
a
giavour
hat
enjoys
upon
earth
doubtless
alluding
to
the
peculiar
custom
of
the
franks
in
uncovering
their
head
in
saluting
and
the
wear
and
tear
that
has
to
undergo
may
your
transmuted
soul
become
in
hell
a
hackney
ass
for
the
jews
themselves
to
ride
about
on
and
many
such
emphatic
compliments
are
the
height
of
fashion
among
the
zealous
adherents
of
each
adverse
party
not
only
in
the
west
but
in
the
east
is
strange
there
should
such
difference
be
tweedledum
and
tweedledee
apart
from
the
foregoing
the
very
meaning
of
the
word
islam
or
resignation
to
the
service
and
commands
of
god
has
been
a
source
of
much
dissertation
and
dissension
and
has
produced
a
variety
of
sects
of
which
the
hanefees
mevlevees
rifayees
and
abdals
are
the
most
noted
in
turkey
the
hanefees
are
the
contemplative
philosophers
oriental
spiritualists
or
transcendentalists
and
to
this
class
the
sultan
and
the
principal
part
of
the
people
belong
the
mevlevees
are
the
dancing
or
whirling
dervishes
and
they
may
therefore
be
considered
as
the
oriental
shakers
their
object
is
practical
resignation
to
god
which
state
of
mind
they
think
they
attain
by
whirling
round
and
round
until
their
senses
are
lost
in
the
dizzy
motion
they
conform
to
the
general
tenets
and
observances
but
their
form
of
worship
is
peculiar
their
religious
edifices
are
called
tekkés
which
are
open
every
tuesday
and
friday
and
are
frequently
visited
by
the
sultan
and
europeans
in
general
a
large
square
space
which
is
surrounded
by
a
circular
railing
constitutes
the
scene
of
their
ritual
or
ceremonies
a
gallery
occupies
three
sides
of
the
building
in
which
is
the
latticed
apartment
of
the
sultan
and
the
place
for
the
turkish
ladies
in
every
mosque
and
here
also
there
is
a
niche
opposite
the
entrance
called
the
mihrab
which
indicates
the
direction
of
mecca
the
walls
are
adorned
with
entablatures
ornamented
with
verses
from
the
koran
and
with
ciphers
of
sultans
and
mottos
in
memory
of
other
benevolent
individuals
who
have
endowed
the
tekké
the
sheikh
or
leader
of
the
community
sits
in
front
of
the
mihrab
on
an
angora
or
a
carpet
attended
by
two
of
his
disciples
an
attenuated
old
man
with
a
visage
furrowed
and
withered
by
time
bronzed
by
many
successive
suns
his
long
and
grizzly
beard
witnessing
to
the
ravages
of
age
while
his
prominent
eyes
sparkling
like
lightnings
amid
the
surrounding
darkness
are
the
only
symbols
of
animation
or
life
in
his
frame
the
dervishes
as
they
enter
make
a
low
obeisance
with
folded
hands
to
this
patron
saint
with
an
air
of
mystic
veneration
and
take
their
stand
with
their
faces
towards
mecca
the
old
sheikh
arises
and
presiding
over
the
assembly
commences
the
services
their
peculiar
called
sikké
of
thick
brown
felt
in
the
shape
of
a
sugar
loaf
and
long
and
flowing
robes
of
varied
hues
make
them
seem
like
fantastic
representations
of
some
other
sphere
particularly
when
they
commence
the
slow
and
measured
prostrations
of
mussulman
worship
prayers
being
over
each
dervish
doffs
his
mantle
and
appears
in
a
long
white
fustanella
trailing
the
polished
floor
and
of
innumerable
folds
with
a
tightly
fitting
vest
of
the
same
pure
color
they
now
defile
two
by
two
before
the
sheikh
who
extending
his
hand
towards
them
seems
to
diffuse
a
sort
of
magnetism
which
irradiates
every
countenance
as
they
stand
immovable
the
wild
and
thrilling
music
slowly
pervades
every
sense
until
suddenly
one
of
the
number
extends
his
arms
and
begins
to
revolve
noiselessly
with
slow
and
measured
step
the
folds
of
his
ample
skirt
now
gradually
open
like
the
wings
of
a
bird
and
with
the
swiftness
of
his
motion
expand
until
the
dervish
only
appears
like
the
centre
of
a
whirlwind
the
rest
are
all
alike
in
motion
arms
extended
eyes
half
closed
as
in
a
dream
the
head
inclined
on
one
side
they
move
round
and
round
to
the
measured
time
of
the
music
as
if
floating
in
ecstasy
the
calm
and
unimpassioned
chief
with
slow
and
stealthy
step
wanders
among
their
evolutions
suddenly
they
cease
and
march
around
the
circle
the
music
increases
its
measure
and
the
dervishes
again
commence
their
giddy
motions
old
and
young
seem
to
be
in
a
visionary
rhapsody
perhaps
transported
in
the
bewildering
whirl
to
the
regions
of
the
blest
they
languish
with
rapture
in
the
arms
of
the
houris
of
paradise
or
lose
their
earthly
senses
amid
the
glories
which
surround
the
throne
of
allah
till
suddenly
they
stand
transfixed
their
outspread
and
snowy
drapery
folding
around
them
like
the
marble
investment
of
an
antique
statue
they
are
all
prostrated
exhausted
by
their
ecstasies
and
immovable
until
the
sheikh
recalls
them
to
the
realities
of
time
by
his
holy
benediction
when
they
slowly
rise
again
compass
the
building
and
enveloping
themselves
with
their
mantles
silently
disappear
howling
dervishes
there
is
an
intoxication
in
the
very
motions
of
the
whirling
dervishes
but
the
horrible
ceremonies
of
the
rifayees
are
really
distressing
to
the
beholder
a
long
empty
hall
much
like
that
of
the
inquisition
as
its
walls
are
adorned
by
an
infinite
variety
of
instruments
of
torture
constitutes
their
temple
of
worship
the
fanatical
disciples
of
this
sect
assemble
every
thursday
at
their
tekké
which
is
in
scutari
and
after
the
performance
of
the
usual
ritual
of
the
mussulmans
commence
their
ceremonies
by
ranging
themselves
along
the
three
sides
of
the
apartment
and
within
the
balustrade
which
serves
to
separate
them
from
the
spectators
their
sheikh
takes
his
stand
before
the
mihrab
facing
the
assembly
and
three
or
four
of
the
members
furnishing
themselves
with
instruments
of
music
place
themselves
in
the
centre
of
the
hall
the
performance
then
begins
by
a
monotonous
chant
accompanied
with
music
and
the
waving
of
their
heads
to
and
fro
which
seems
to
create
a
sympathetic
vertigo
in
the
mussulman
bystanders
for
they
often
are
irresistibly
drawn
into
the
ranks
by
degrees
the
motion
increases
the
chant
grows
louder
and
their
countenances
become
livid
and
their
lungs
seem
to
expand
with
the
noise
and
excitement
the
line
becomes
a
solid
phalanx
as
they
place
their
arms
on
each
other
shoulders
and
withdrawing
a
step
suddenly
advance
with
a
tremendous
and
savage
yell
allah
allah
allah
hoo
which
divine
appellative
is
to
be
repeated
a
thousand
times
uninterruptedly
this
strenuous
effort
renders
them
perfectly
hideous
their
very
eyes
seem
ready
to
start
from
their
sockets
and
their
lips
foam
as
the
inspiration
possesses
them
thus
retreating
and
springing
forward
they
each
time
with
increasing
energy
renew
their
invocations
of
allah
allah
allah
hoo
until
the
distinctness
of
their
articulation
is
lost
and
their
exclamation
becomes
in
reality
a
complete
howl
as
if
proceeding
from
a
pack
of
enraged
dogs
thus
meriting
the
sobriquet
of
the
howling
dervishes
the
movements
and
cries
increase
in
swiftness
until
a
mist
of
dust
pervades
the
dim
apartment
and
the
wild
and
pale
enthusiasts
drenched
with
perspiration
seem
like
fantastic
demons
in
the
realms
of
discord
suddenly
some
of
them
stripped
to
their
waists
rush
forward
and
seizing
the
poignards
and
stilettoes
commence
a
wild
infuriated
dance
jumping
leaping
and
lacerating
themselves
fixing
the
weapons
into
the
hollow
of
their
cheeks
and
twisting
them
round
and
round
as
if
on
pivots
until
exhausted
from
exertion
they
fall
to
the
ground
in
a
spasmodic
fit
only
to
show
with
how
small
pain
the
sores
of
faith
are
cured
again
now
the
enthusiastic
mothers
approach
and
cast
their
children
before
the
presiding
sheikh
who
as
they
lie
extended
before
him
deliberately
plants
his
heavy
feet
upon
their
frail
bodies
and
so
stands
for
some
seconds
old
men
and
maidens
lay
themselves
low
before
this
saint
who
is
supposed
to
be
by
this
time
so
inspired
as
to
have
a
miraculous
power
of
expressing
all
ailments
and
maladies
from
the
human
frame
and
to
have
become
so
etherealized
by
the
ecstatic
ceremonies
as
to
lose
all
his
specific
gravity
the
abdals
include
the
various
classes
of
the
stoics
who
generally
pretend
to
a
total
renunciation
of
all
worldly
comforts
sometimes
clothed
in
the
coarsest
garments
and
again
half
naked
and
even
with
lacerated
bodies
they
wander
through
the
mohammedan
dominions
a
miserable
set
of
frantic
idle
and
conceited
beggars
they
may
in
fact
be
considered
the
communists
of
the
east
who
despising
honest
pursuits
live
upon
the
community
at
large
they
commit
the
worst
extravagances
under
the
pretence
of
heavenly
raptures
and
are
even
supposed
to
be
divinely
inspired
idiots
and
fools
are
esteemed
by
the
mohammedans
as
the
favorites
of
heaven
their
spirits
are
supposed
to
have
deserted
their
earthly
tenements
and
to
be
holding
converse
with
angels
while
their
bodies
still
wander
about
the
earth
it
would
be
wearisome
to
go
into
further
details
for
infinite
is
the
diversity
of
the
orthodox
theologies
of
the
mohammedans
with
the
articles
of
the
creed
on
which
all
the
doctors
of
divinity
differ
hopeless
must
be
the
task
of
the
student
to
surmount
the
commentaries
of
the
canonical
authors
not
to
mention
the
innumerable
heretical
tenets
of
other
sects
which
must
be
studied
to
be
controverted
verily
we
would
suggest
the
recipe
of
a
certain
molla
who
must
have
given
up
in
dire
despair
whenever
you
meet
with
an
infidel
abuse
him
with
all
your
might
and
no
one
will
doubt
you
are
a
staunch
believer
as
long
as
war
and
its
exciting
scenes
occupied
the
restless
minds
of
the
arabs
there
was
no
time
for
religious
or
party
intrigue
the
simple
la
satisfied
the
momentary
breathings
of
their
souls
heavenward
the
turmoil
of
their
life
the
glitter
of
their
arms
and
dreadful
carnage
of
all
infidels
sufficed
to
ease
their
fancy
and
satisfy
the
thirst
for
excitement
it
was
as
they
wiped
their
scimitars
and
during
the
reaction
which
comparative
peace
and
luxury
created
that
their
minds
free
from
more
substantial
food
and
activity
sought
greater
refinement
of
spirituality
in
the
absence
of
the
real
the
speculative
began
to
grow
until
imams
and
ulema
found
that
they
could
turn
the
tide
of
human
affairs
to
their
own
advantage
by
exciting
polemical
and
theological
controversies
a
comparative
study
of
the
niceties
of
mussulman
doctrine
and
distinctions
with
those
of
more
refined
and
enlightened
creeds
while
it
displays
many
and
striking
similarities
only
illustrates
with
startling
vividness
the
time
worn
maxim
that
there
is
nothing
new
under
the
sun
chapter
din
or
practice
of
religion
the
din
or
practice
of
religion
comprises
ablution
prayer
alms
fasting
and
a
pilgrimage
to
mecca
bathing
and
various
forms
of
ablutions
were
practised
long
before
the
time
of
mohammed
but
he
has
incorporated
cleanliness
with
his
religion
until
his
followers
seem
to
regard
water
as
not
only
possessed
of
virtue
to
cleanse
the
pollutions
of
their
bodies
but
as
purifying
their
souls
from
the
contamination
of
sin
therefore
fountains
are
always
to
be
found
in
the
neighborhood
of
all
the
mosques
in
every
part
of
the
city
and
its
suburbs
and
on
the
highways
for
they
never
omit
this
preliminary
to
their
devotions
which
includes
washing
the
face
hands
and
feet
and
when
they
happen
to
be
in
the
desert
where
no
water
can
be
obtained
sand
is
substituted
indeed
the
same
ablutions
are
so
essential
that
their
observance
is
invariably
required
of
the
faithful
before
the
administration
of
an
oath
prayers
five
times
a
day
the
mussulmans
are
summoned
to
prayer
by
the
muezzin
early
in
the
morning
just
before
the
sun
is
above
the
horizon
the
ezan
resounds
through
the
still
atmosphere
from
the
airy
balcony
of
the
tapering
minaré
the
muezzin
covering
his
ears
with
his
hands
as
if
to
exclude
all
terrestrial
sound
turns
his
face
towards
mecca
and
chants
with
musical
cadence
the
beautiful
arabic
formula
allah
ikber
allah
ikber
c
great
god
great
god
there
is
no
god
but
god
i
attest
that
mohammed
is
the
apostle
of
god
oh
great
redeemer
oh
ruler
of
the
universe
great
god
great
god
there
is
no
god
but
god
and
he
slowly
moves
round
the
balcony
as
if
addressing
the
inhabitants
of
all
parts
of
the
world
those
who
catch
the
echoes
of
the
holy
call
exclaim
with
solemn
earnestness
there
is
no
power
no
strength
but
in
god
almighty
again
when
the
hour
of
noon
seems
to
indicate
a
moment
of
repose
to
the
world
the
ezan
summons
all
thoughts
and
aspirations
to
the
great
god
at
three
in
the
afternoon
at
sunset
and
finally
at
nine
the
call
resounds
ere
they
prepare
for
sleep
how
beautiful
thus
to
note
the
passage
of
time
to
look
thus
from
earth
to
heaven
to
forget
for
a
moment
all

a

land
those
who
happen
to
be
near
a
mosque
enter
it
for
the
purpose
of
performing
their
devotions
others
are
in
their
own
houses
and
many
prostrate
themselves
by
the
wayside
or
even
on
board
the
daily
steamers
the
mosques
are
always
open
and
there
is
an
imam
who
presides
over
the
devotions
the
interior
of
a
mosque
is
as
simple
as
that
of
any
protestant
church
the
only
ornaments
seen
are
the
suspended
lamps
interspersed
here
and
there
with
ostrich
eggs
there
are
no
accommodations
for
sitting
down
and
the
altar
is
the
niche
or
mihrab
there
is
a
small
pulpit
on
one
side
from
which
a
sermon
is
preached
every
friday
noon
but
the
form
of
prayer
is
always
the
same
as
they
assemble
they
leave
their
shoes
at
the
door
for
the
ground

holy
and
seat
themselves
upon
the
floor
which
is
either
covered
with
carpet
or
matting
at
the
appointed
time
the
imam
commences
the
service
by
taking
his
position
before
the
mihrab
and
placing
his
thumbs
behind
his
ears
as
if
with
his
open
palms
to
shut
out
all
objects
of
sense
proclaims
to
the
assembly
the
congregation
rise
and
imitate
the
officiating
priest
all
remain
standing
with
their
hands
folded
on
their
bosoms
while
the
imam
repeats
the
first
chapter
of
the
koran
which
is
the
lord
prayer
of
the
mohammedans
termed
fatiha
in
the
name
of
the
most
merciful
god
praise
be
to
god
the
lord
of
all
creatures
the
most
merciful
the
king
of
the
day
of
judgment
thee
do
we
worship
and
of
thee
do
we
beg
assistance
direct
us
in
the
right
way
in
the
way
of
those
to
whom
thou
hast
been
gracious
not
of
those
against
whom
them
art
incensed
nor
of
those
who
go
astray
amen
they
then
make
a
by
placing
the
hands
on
the
knees
and
bending
the
person
forward
a
complete
genuflexion
succeeds
which
is
made
by
bending
the
knees
to
the
ground
and
extending
the
arms
forward
as
a
support
to
the
body
while
the
forehead
touches
the
ground
these
same
genuflexions
are
again
repeated
then
partially
rising
they
sit
on
their
bended
knees
here
endeth
the
first
lesson
for
two
other
similar
ceremonies
are
repeated
successively
during
which
any
portion
of
the
koran
may
be
selected
by
the
officiating
imam
for
recitation
the
termination
of
the
service
is
known
when
the
imam
after
a
few
moments
of
silent
meditation
slowly
turns
his
head
first
towards
the
right
and
then
to
the
left
in
token
of
salutation
to
the
two
recording
angels
who
are
supposed
to
be
hovering
over
each
shoulder
he
then
strokes
his
beard
and
rises
from
his
devotions
his
example
is
followed
by
the
congregation
who
immediately
disperse
there
is
a
wonderful
air
of
sacred
stillness
during
the
services
in
a
mosque
the
simplest
and
plainest
attire
is
worn
and
everything
excluded
which
could
divert
the
attention
from
god
and
his
worship
no
man
utters
prayers
as
matters
of
form
while
he
stares
about
to
see
how
his
neighbors
clothes
are
fashioned
no
sound
of
footsteps
or
creaking
boots
is
heard
nor
opening
or
shutting
of
pews
no
cushioned
seats
invite
to
listlessness
or
even
to
slumbers
no
ennui
steals
over
their
devotional
spirits
the
world
is
literally
and
practically
excluded
no
earthly
houris
tempt
their
thoughts
from
god
with
alluring
smiles
and
recognitions
there
is
no
peeping
from
behind
the
prayer
books
or
fluttering
fans
or
any
other
of
the
insinuating
wiles
of
coquetry
ladies
with
their
sweet
eyes
turned
to
heaven
while
their
rosy
lips
are
modeled
to
scorn
of
their
neighbor
want
of
taste
and
fashion
are
invisible
in
the
mohammedan
temple
here
the
faithful
come
to
worship
god
and
they
wisely
divest
the
shrine
of
their
devotions
of
all
the
trappings
of
earthly
grandeur
and
leave
beyond
the
portal
the
alluring
and
sensual
pleasures
of
earth
the
presence
of
infidels
during
the
hours
of
worship
is
expressly
forbidden
not
only
as
being
a
source
of
mental
distraction
to
the
faithful
but
in
reality
an
act
of
perjury
on
their
own
part
it
is
not
fitting
that
the
idolaters
should
visit
the
temples
of
god
being
witnesses
against
their
own
souls
of
their
infidelity
the
works
of
these
men
are
vain
and
they
shall
remain
in
forever
but
he
only
shall
visit
the
temples
of
god
who
believeth
in
god
and
the
last
day
and
is
constant
at
prayer
and
payeth
legal
alms
and
feareth
god
alone
the
essence
of
islamism
resignation
to
the
will
of
god
has
its
legitimate
effect
upon
the
benevolence
of
the
mohammedans
if
allah
bestows
wealth
and
luxury
they
receive
and
enjoy
the
good
gifts
but
without
any
if
misfortune
arrive
they
submit
without
any
feeling
of
degradation
practically
illustrating
the
words
of
job
shall
we
receive
good
at
the
hand
of
the
lord
and
not
evil
the
faithful
are
enjoined
to
be
constant
in
prayer
and
give
alms
contribute
out
of
your
substance
towards
the
religion
of
god
and
throw
not
yourselves
into
perdition
do
good
for
god
loveth
those
who
do
good
unto
such
of
you
as
believe
and
bestow
alms
shall
be
given
a
great
reward
and
whoever
pays
not
his
legal
contribution
of
alms
duly
it
is
declared
by
mohammed
that
he
shall
have
a
serpent
twisted
about
his
neck
at
the
resurrection
so
that
the
mussulmans
have
every
incentive
to
charity
both
as
regards
this
life
and
that
which
is
to
come
it
is
very
common
for
them
to
found
charitable
institutions
such
as
poorhouses
hospitals
and
the
same
principles
of
charity
induce
them
to
an
unlimited
hospitality
during
the
feast
of
ramazan
a
special
table
is
set
for
the
poor
in
the
houses
of
the
wealthy
who
come
and
partake
without
summons
or
invitation
the
innumerable
beggars
and
mendicant
dervishes
in
turkey
are
doubtless
tolerated
from
the
same
spirit
of
liberality
as
the
koran
is
but
a
compilation
from
jewish
and
christian
writers
adapted
to
the
spirit
of
the
age
in
which
it
was
promulgated
no
doubt
the
difficult
but
sublime
doctrine
of
christ
let
not
thy
right
hand
know
what
thy
left
hand
doeth
was
appreciated
by
the
prophet
in
his
directions
regarding
the
exercise
of
the
grace
of
charity
god
loveth
not
the
proud
or
vainglorious
nor
those
who
bestow
their
wealth
in
charity
to
be
observed
of
men
verily
god
will
not
wrong
any
one
even
the
weight
of
an
ant
and
if
it
be
a
good
action
he
will
double
it
and
will
recompense
it
in
his
sight
with
a
great
reward
their
charities
are
therefore
bestowed
with
the
greatest
modesty
and
willingness
their
supplications
for
aid
from
others
made
without
any
air
of
servility
it
devolves
then
upon
modern
civilization
to
establish
corporate
and
organized
charitable
bodies
in
turkey
and
to
initiate
the
simple
mussulmans
into
the
self
satisfaction
which
is
awakened
by
public
meetings
and
the
parade
of
printed
records
we
live
to
eat
or
we
eat
to
live
therefore
when
we
are
denied
the
great
business
and
aim
of
life
we
undergo
a
very
palpable
kind
of
mortification
the
dainty
epicurean
seldom
conforms
to
any
regulations
for
extra
abstemiousness
while
others
more
superstitious
merely
vary
the
hours
of
their
repast
merging
the
substantial
meal
into
those
which
have
not
the
nomenclature
but
yet
become
the
reality
of
a
good
dinner
again
the
pleasant
variety
of
fish
for
fowl
or
of
oil
for
butter
does
not
leave
any
sensation
of
emptiness
or
mortification
of
the
appetite
but
there
is
a
sort
of
genuineness
in
the
mohammedan
style
of
observing
a
fast
when
for
fourteen
consecutive
hours
absolutely
nothing
passes
the
lips
not
a
drop
of
water
not
even
the
homemade
saliva
is
swallowed
no
pipe
is
smoked
nor
anything
indulged
in
to
palliate
the
gnawings
of
hunger
and
thirst
the
laborer
toils
under
a
summer
sun
the
weary
hammal
climbs
the
towering
hills
under
an
incredible
load
the
athletic
boatman
for
many
hours
pulls
the
oars
work
toil
labor
cease
not
but
the
wonted
sustenance
is
utterly
withheld
it
is
wonderful
to
see
this
part
of
the
mussulman
population
during
the
fasting
season
bodily
strength
and
vigor
exuding
in
profuse
perspiration
from
every
pore
while
steady
persistence
in
utter
abstinence
from
all
refreshment
is
persevered
in
this
great
monthly
fast
occurs
once
in
every
year
the
month
of
ramazan
shall
ye
fast
in
which
the
koran
was
sent
down
as
they
observe
the
lunar
year
it
falls
in
all
seasons
and
when
it
occurs
during
the
the
sufferings
of
the
faithful
are
truly
great
and
distressing
not
only
are
they
forbidden
all
lusts
of
the
belly
and
the
flesh
such
as
may
be
committed
by
the
eye
ear
tongue
hand
feet
and
other
members
but
the
heart
must
be
abstracted
as
much
as
possible
from
the
world
and
turned
only
to
god
and
paradise
thus
a
season
of
holy
rest
is
instituted
among
the
many
idlers
who
can
afford
to
loiter
away
the
day
some
assume
an
appearance
of
unusual
sanctimoniousness
whose
peculiarly
long
faces
and
abstracted
airs
most
effectually
ward
off
any
attempts
to
recall
them
to
the
realities
of
life
they
listlessly
toy
with
their
chaplets
gazing
into
vacancy
as
polished
bead
after
bead
slips
through
their
fingers
and
seemingly
are
as
divested
of
thought
as
the
unmeaning
but
apparently
absorbing
playthings
they
ever
dangle
these
beads
have
no
such
significance
as
the
catholic
rosaries
but
are
always
in
the
hand
of
the
oriental
gentlemen
and
ladies
and
are
often
of
great
value
being
composed
of
large
pearls
and
other
precious
gems
though
the
ordinary
style
is
to
make
them
of
cocoa
shells
whale
teeth
ivory
or
amber
during
this
fast
the
faithful
are
at
the
gate
of
religion
and
the
very
odor
of
their
breath
is
considered
to
be
sweeter
than
musk
to
the
olfactories
of
allah
some
of
them
observe
the
fast
in
its
true
spirit
and
letter
and
all
externally
conform
to
its
regulations
no
doubt
to
those
who
are
incapable
of
religious
ecstasies
who
can
not
transport
themselves
out
of
the
world
while
clogged
with
their
human
tenements
who
relish
not
the
unsubstantial
viands
of
a
superstitious
faith
the
hours
drag
very
heavily
on
from
sunrise
to
sunset
physical
necessities
sometimes
force
the
less
spiritualized
to
taste
some
of
the
forbidden
fruits
or
to
avail
themselves
of
this
occasion
to
test
the
truth
of
the
proverb
that
stolen
waters
are
sweet
and
bread
eaten
in
secret
is
pleasant
the
more
faithful
in
the
midst
of
their
sufferings
remember
that
as
mohammed
was
fortunately
of
human
mould
like
themselves
he
informed
them
god
would
make
this
an
ease
unto
you
and
not
a
difficulty
therefore
god
knoweth
that
ye
defraud
yourselves
therein
and
forgiveth
you
and
now
therefore
and
earnestly
desire
that
which
god
ordaineth
you
and
eat
and
drink
until
ye
can
plainly
distinguish
a
white
thread
by
the
then
keep
the
fast
until
night
thus
the
faithful
acquire
new
zest
for
all
their
sensual
appetites
as
they
anxiously
listen
for
the
sunset
ezan
which
releases
them
from
their
sufferings
the
breaking
of
the
fast
is
called
iftar
each
person
is
furnished
with
a
small
table
upon
which
are
a
bowl
of
light
soup
a
few
olives
some
preserves
and
cakes
a
chibouk
already
filled
and
ready
to
be
lighted
is
placed
by
their
side
when
the
cannon
booming
over
the
bosphorus
announces
the
setting
sun
each
one
partakes
sparingly
of
these
refreshments
and
having
regaled
himself
with
the
fumes
of
tobacco
attends
to
his
regular
sunset
prayers
after
which
a
sumptuous
dinner
is
served
and
enjoyed
the
grand
namaz
prayer
is
performed
after
which
night
is
turned
into
day
the
streets
usually
dark
and
sombre
are
brightly
illuminated
and
filled
with
people
mussulmans
armenians
greeks
jews
and
other
giavours
who
all
seem
anxious
to
enjoy
the
carnival
if
not
to
share
the
penance
the
slender
and
tapering
minarés
are
now
girdled
in
light
while
between
the
consecrated
spires
depend
fantastic
and
luminous
bodies
the
brilliant
but
mimic
forms
of
familiar
objects
the
kahvés
are
crowded
with
wearied
mussulmans
puffing
out
clouds
of
smoke
in
pure
spite
for
their
long
abstinence
from
their
favorite
weed
while
their
imaginations
are
regaled
with
the
exciting
tales
of
the
meddahs
or
the
drolleries
of
the
far
famed
stalls
are
erected
with
all
the
various
preparations
of
food
peculiarly
agreeable
to
turkish
palates
tempting
shops
stand
invitingly
open
and
tinkling
music
vibrates
through
the
air
if
allah
only
is
remembered
in
the
day
night
seems
to
exclude
that
divinity
from
every
thought
while
eblis
is
apparently
enthroned
with
all
the
orgies
of
his
dominions
exhausted
nature
at
length
compels
the
laboring
classes
to
seek
their
couches
while
the
more
fortunate
pashas
and
efendis
beguile
the
remaining
hours
till
morn
with
continued
festivities
and
the
exchange
of
social
visits
just
before
daybreak
the
drum
resounds
through
the
streets
of
the
metropolis
when
the
faithful
without
any
reluctance
arise
from
their
slumbers
to
avail
themselves
of
their
last
chance
of
regaling
their
appetites
and
fortifying
their
corporeal
frames
against
the
sufferings
of
the
next
fourteen
consecutive
hours
the
morning
gun
now
booming
upon
the
still
air
from
hill
to
hill
proclaims
the
dawn
of
another
day
of
self
mortification
at
the
gate
of
heaven
chapter
vi
pilgrimage
to
mecca
how
true
the
observation
that
the
most
helpless
of
all
creatures
is
man
born
of
a
woman
who
cometh
forth
like
the
tender
bud
of
a
delicate
and
fading
flower
the
soul
embarks
on
the
vast
ocean
of
life
in
so
frail
and
delicate
a
tenement
that
there
is
no
semblance
of
strength
to
resist
the
angry
waves
that
continually
dash
against
the
and
quivering
fabric
but
it
outrides
the
storm
of
three
score
years
and
ten
until
it
is
engulfed
in
the
maelstrom
and
eddying
circles
of
the
river
of
death
how
vast
how
exquisite
are
the
sensibilities
of
man
whose
first
emotions
of
pleasure
and
pain
are
the
alphabet
of
humanity
the
pleasure
felt
by
a
sentient
being
creates
the
first
ideas
of
good
while
on
the
other
hand
the
sensation
of
pain
is
synonymous
with
evil
as
we
awake
into
existence
each
passing
moment
seems
to
develop
new
desires
our
grasping
souls
and
bodily
wants
are
constantly
each
other
cravings
unsatisfied
human
nature
is
ever
on
the
alert
crying
give
give
this
restless
search
for
good
pleasure
or
happiness
leads
its
victims
astray
and
thus
is
created
the
preponderance
of
evil
for
such
hot
and
eager
haste
stays
not
to
discriminate
the
fatal
apple
seemed
so
good
and
so
much
to
be
desired
to
the
mother
of
all
living
that
she
took
and
ate
but
when
she
had
eaten
her
eyes
were
opened
thus
by
such
efforts
to
secure
the
good
the
limit
is
overstepped
and
suffering
and
sorrow
entailed
still
none
enjoy
and
none
suffer
in
the
same
degree
innumerable
have
been
the
specimens
of
nature
handiwork
yet
never
were
any
two
individuals
alike
in
their
natural
or
intellectual
structure
there
is
a
wonderful
connection
between
the
physical
and
the
moral
in
our
curious
composition
and
the
latter
is
so
much
modified
by
the
former
that
the
variety
of
temperaments
and
dispositions
may
be
attributed
to
the
reciprocal
influences
of
these
two
constituents
of
our
being
the
origin
of
good
and
evil
is
then
embodied
in
our
own
hearts
in
the
structure
of
the
human
frame
in
our
natural
susceptibilities
to
pleasure
and
pain
the
individuality
of
pleasure
and
pain
creates
an
approving
and
disapproving
principle
in
every
human
frame
and
each
man
is
pleased
with
himself
when
he
enjoys
a
personal
benefit
from
good
or
pleasure
and
displeased
when
he
suffers
from
the
consequences
of
pain
or
evil
the
lesson
is
soon
learned
that
the
evil
might
have
been
avoided
and
conscience
raises
her
silent
testimony
in
the
bosom
apart
from
our
own
sensations
there
seems
to
be
a
superstitious
principle
innate
in
the
human
breast
a
deference
to
a
supreme
good
which
as
the
ruler
and
creator
of
the
universe
holds
all
created
things
in
awe
and
to
whom
the
conscience
or
and
principle
pays
all
deference
this
principle
has
existed
under
every
form
of
humanity
in
every
variety
of
nation
and
blood
and
has
been
educated
and
developed
by
different
circumstances
thus
are
derived
all
religions
and
the
fear
of
retribution
for
transgressing
the
bounds
which
conscience
claims
for
the
real
good
and
its
essence
the
supreme
creator
has
led
men
to
various
acts
of
atonement
or
the
mind
of
man
instinctively
looked
from
nature
up
to
nature
god
and
sought
an
embodiment
for
the
divine
essence
as
there
was
for
the
human
the
earliest
semblance
of
divinity
was
displayed
in
the
sun
moon
and
stars
the
glorious
orb
of
day
the
great
source
of
light
and
heat
the
vivifier
of
all
creation
whose
genial
rays
warming
the
bosom
of
the
mother
earth
caused
the
tender
grass
to
spring
forth
and
every
herb
yielding
fruit
to
give
its
increase
for
the
sustenance
of
animal
life
the
great
luminary
of
the
vast
universe
so
beautiful
to
gaze
upon
and
so
powerful
in
its
sway
over
the
world
alotted
to
man
for
a
seemed
as
if
placed
in
the
heavens
for
the
especial
adoration
of
all
created
things
the
gentle
moon
with
silver
sheen
and
softer
radiance
was
fitting
bride
for
the
all
glorious
and
omnipotent
god
of
day
and
the
sparkling
stars
like
so
many
distant
portals
to
the
dominions
of
divine
effulgence
emitting
each
a
ray
of
the
internal
brightness
seemed
one
and
all
shrines
of
holy
devotion
such
was
the
revelation
of
nature
and
no
wonder
that
the
innate
impulse
to
revere
and
worship
the
author
of
the
universe
was
kindled
into
a
fire
of
enthusiasm
by
the
scintillations
of
the
starry
world
not
content
with
the
semblance
of
the
creator
in
his
works
the
mind
of
man
sought
an
object
more
tangible
and
thus
doubtless
originated
the
idol
worship
of
the
ancients
then
followed
a
succession
of
creeds
and
dogmas
rites
and
ceremonies
to
which
the
superstitious
principle
was
ever
ready
to
yield
obeisance
ambitious
and
designing
men
sought
to
embody
in
themselves
the
germs
of
sanctity
and
holiness
even
did
they
add
the
sanction
of
intercourse
with
the
gods
even
did
they
awaken
the
silent
marble
into
mysterious
life
and
utter
oracles
and
decrees
from
the
lifeless
stone
thus
was
nurtured
the
superstitious
feeling
in
the
multitude
until
the
most
absurd
and
revolting
rites
became
the
sole
end
and
aim
of
existence
until
the
simple
hindoo
would
with
a
holy
zeal
cast
himself
under
the
wheels
of
the
ponderous
car
of
juggernaut
and
while
his
tortured
body
was
crushed
to
atoms
rejoice
with
ecstatic
faith
in
future
felicity
the
same
principle
of
superstitious
has
existed
in
as
great
force
under
the
christian
dispensation
even
kings
and
emperors
have
tried
to
stifle
the
voice
of
conscience
by
the
most
severe
acts
of
penance
and
humiliation
and
the
humbler
members
of
the
human
family
have
willingly
suffered
every
variety
of
bodily
anguish
which
the
most
cunning
devices
of
a
wily
and
calculating
priesthood
could
contrive
while
from
many
and
hidden
motives
they
have
striven
to
produce
an
entire
abnegation
of
self
and
a
renunciation
of
all
worldly
hopes
in
the
hearts
of
their
victims
wars
were
undertaken
territories
were
coveted
and
a
holy
crusade
was
the
pretext
for
taking
possession
of
the
city
of
jerusalem
the
shrine
of
the
holy
sepulchre
and
where
crowds
of
pilgrims
brought
their
offerings
and
laid
them
in
the
coffers
of
the
sanctuary
the
dangers
which
beset
the
pilgrims
amid
the
scimitars
of
the
barbarous
tartars
was
the
pretext
for
all
europe
to
rise
in
arms
with
the
determination
to
conquer
or
die
in
their
defence
a
wild
enthusiast
with
haggard
features
a
body
worn
and
wasted
with
fasting
and
holy
vigils
and
enveloped
in
coarse
and
dusty
sackcloth
elevating
the
symbolic
cross
in
his
attenuated
fingers
wanders
from
palace
to
palace
from
house
to
house
from
hut
to
hamlet
calling
aloud
for
vengeance
upon
the
followers
of
the
crescent
who
dared
to
molest
the
children
of
god
in
the
performance
of
their
sacred
duties
as
his
naked
feet
pierced
by
every
flinty
rock
leave
their
crimson
stains
in
his
track
so
does
the
thirst
for
moslem
blood
burn
and
consume
the
vitals
of
the
restless
human
throngs
who
listen
to
his
wild
harangues
pope
urban
was
ready
to
fan
this
flame
and
the
panting
multitude
were
by
his
holy
and
supreme
power
absolved
from
the
weight
of
all
past
offences
as
well
as
all
those
they
should
ever
commit
if
they
would
prosecute
with
zeal
this
holy
war
the
worst
of
sinners
robbers
and
assassins
over
whose
hardened
hearts
there
still
lingered
the
dying
glow
of
the
internal
fire
of
conscience
or
before
whose
vision
ever
flittered
the
phantoms
of
past
transgressions
rejoiced
to
say
avaunt
for
ever
to
the
ghosts
of
their
departed
crimes
and
feel
an
assurance
of
no
future
retribution
for
their
dark
deeds
of
horror
a
new
field
for
rapine
and
adventure
opened
before
them
and
they
rushed
impetuously
on
to
the
combat
many
who
had
led
a
life
of
more
retired
wickedness
and
grown
grey
in
sin
were
glad
to
seize
a
hope
of
salvation
even
on
the
borders
of
eternity
and
tottered
along
with
the
vast
concourse
rich
and
poor
young
and
old
with
fervid
zeal
embraced
the
means
of
future
happiness
beyond
the
grave
and
the
vast
territory
through
which
these
soldiers
of
the
cross
wended
their
way
was
whitened
with
the
bones
of
the
self
sacrificed
even
after
the
great
champion
godfrey
de
bouillon
had
gained
the
prize
and
enjoyed
a
regal
rank
of
one
short
year
duration
he
had
to
surrender
his
earthly
throne
to
his
holiness
at
rome
and
content
himself
like
his
followers
with
the
hopes
of
a
kingdom
in
the
unseen
world
vain
would
be
the
effort
to
count
the
victims
of
religious
enthusiasm
of
the
attempts
to
appease
the
great
unseen
essence
of
human
life
to
propitiate
the
favor
of
that
power
which
as
it
has
called
into
being
can
also
summon
his
creatures
from
their
earthly
tenements
and
dispose
of
their
spirits
as
seemeth
best
to
his
sovereign
will
but
holy
wars
and
pilgrimages
are
not
confined
to
the
followers
of
the
cross
wherever
the
cresent
glitters
on
the
dome
or
the
muezzin
proclaims
the

from
the
pointed
minaré
wherever
throughout
the
vast
dominions
of
the
mussulmans
resounds
the
cry

ikber
allah
ikber
are
the
countless
votaries
of

arise
from
their
peaceful
homes
and
perform
the
sacred
journey
to
the
shrine
of
their
faith
the

temple
at

do
the
pilgrims
trace
a
wearisome
way
through
desert
plains
and
scorching
heats
to
the
spot
where
they
may
roll
off
the
burden
of
and
kiss
the
stone
which
has
been
the
heirloom
to
mortality
since
the
foundation
of
the
world
although
throngs
of
mussulman
pilgrims
yearly
visit
the
holy
city
of
mecca
but
few
europeans
have
left
the
impress
of
their
footsteps
upon
its
soil
what
millions
of
human
beings
nothing
intimidated
by
deserts
mountains
and
all
sorts
of
hardships
have
paid
their
devotions
to
this

the

the

buzz
of
human
voices
as
they
toil
along
their
weary
way
to
the
holy
city

every
mohammedan
is
enjoined
to
perform
this
pilgrimage
or
if
unable
to
go
to
send
a
proxy
or
an
offering
verily
the
first
house
appointed
unto
men
to
worship
in
was
that
which
is
in
mecca
blessed
and
a
direction
to
all
creatures
for
there
was
the
kubla
or
point
to
which
they
were
to
turn
their
faces
in
prayer
and
proclaim
unto
the
people
a
solemn
pilgrimage
let
them
come
unto
thee
on
foot
and
on
every
lean
camel
arriving
from
every
distant
road
that
they
may
be
witnesses
of
the
advantages
which
accrue
to
them
from
the
visiting
this
holy
place
and
may
commemorate
the
name
of
god
on
the
appointed
days
in
gratitude
for
the
brute
cattle
which
he
hath
bestowed
on
them
according
to
the
traditions
of
the
arabs
the
city
of
mecca
has
been
the
place
of
religious
veneration
from
the
earliest
times
near
this
city
on
a
mountain
adam
is
said
to
have
met
his
wife
eve
two
hundred
years
after
the
expulsion
from
paradise
here
when
abraham
was
ready
to
sacrifice
his
son
ishmael
not
isaac
the
identical
ram
which
had
been
offered
by
abel
many
years
before
was
substituted
in
his
place
sent
expressly
from
paradise
here
also
in
the
days
of
idolatry
was
a
temple
dedicated
to
saturn
now
the
holy
temple
of
mecca
so
that
mohammed
found
this
place
already
consecrated
by
sacred
and
ancient
associations
mecca
the
and
medina
the
tomb
of
the
prophet
are
situated
near
each
other
and
not
far
from
the
coast
of
the
red
sea
mecca
is
in
a
valley
surrounded
by
barren
hills
which
produce
nothing
but
the
stones
of
which
the
houses
are
constructed
water
so
essential
to
life
and
most
especially
to
all
mussulmans
is
only
supplied
by
rain
which
is
collected
in
cisterns
no
streams
flowing
from
the
adjacent
mountains
doubtless
the
exceeding
value
all
mohammedans
attach
to
the
pure
element
is
owing
to
its
scarcity
in
these
regions
where
their
religion
was
promulgated
and
the
koran
revealed
from
heaven
their
paradise
is
represented
as
abounding
in
fountains
there
is
the
water
of
keafeeree
or
camphor
a
fountain
at
which
the
people
of
god
shall
drink
so
likened
from
the
aromatic
freshness
of
this
gum
and
its
snowy
whiteness
the
waters
of
zengefeel
or
ginger
and
the
fountain
of
zelzebil
whose
streams
glide
softly
down
the
throat
and
the
fountain
of
which
flows
from
the
highest
regions
of
paradise
and
whereof
those
shall
drink
who
approach
the
divine
presence
notwithstanding
the
barrenness
of
the
soil
and
the
unfavorable
situation
of
the
city
of
mecca
the
wealth
of
its
inhabitants
is
very
great
arabia
felix
truly
happy
in
comparison
to
the
barren
and
desert
tracts
by
which
she
is
surrounded
where
the
gentle
zephyrs
are
perfumed
and
laden
with
aromatic
odors
whose
villages
and
towns
are
crowned
with
plenty
and
adorned
with
gardens
of
delight
and
trees
bearing
all
kinds
of

rejoices
in
a
perpetual
spring
in
this
genial
clime
which
neither
chills
nor
scorches
her
spicy
products
in
mecca
congregate
a
vast
crowd
of
mussulmans
with
their
merchandise
from
all
quarters
of
the
east
so
that
the
inducement
held
out
by
the
prophet
that
they
may
be
witnesses
of
the
advantages
which
accrue
from
visiting
this
holy
place
has
no
little
power
on
the
calculations
of
the
enterprising
while
a
misguided
religious
zeal
sways
the
multitude
the
holy
temple
of
mecca
has
been
under
the
successive
patronage
of
the
caliphs
the
sultans
of
egypt
and
of
turkey
until
by
the
constant
acquisition
of
wealth
it
has
attained
its
present
splendid
magnificence
no
unbeliever
can
profane
the
sacred
precincts
with
the
dust
of
his
feet
nor
approach
within
gun
shot
of
the
consecrated
portico
during
the
season
of
the
visitation
of
the
pilgrims
nor
must
the
faithful
defile
their
sinless
bodies
by
any
contact
with
the
unsanctified
flesh
and
blood
of
the
infidel
jews
and
christians
o
true
believers
verily
the
idolaters
are
unclean
let
them
not
therefore
come
near
unto
the
holy
temple
after
this
year
and
if
ye
fear
want
by
the
cutting
off
trade
and
communication
with
them
god
will
enrich
you
of
his
abundance
if
he
pleaseth
for
god
is
knowing
and
wise
it
is
not
fitting
that
the
idolaters
should
visit
the
temples
of
god
being
witnesses
against
their
own
souls
of
their
infidelity
considering
the
resources
which
have
contributed
to
construct
and
adorn
this
shrine
of
the
mohammedan
faith
the
great
wealth
of
many
nations
and
the
centuries
which
have
successively
rolled
on
each
adding
the
superstitious
offerings
of
religious
votaries
it
is
no
wonder
that
it
is
magnificent
to
behold
the
model
from
paradise
the
rebuilding
by
abram
and
its
preservation
for
so
many
years
the
whole
city
of
mecca
is
considered
holy
ground
but
the
objects
of
special
adoration
are
inclosed
within
a
magnificent
colonnade
the
foundation
of
which
was
laid
by
the
second
caliph
omer
to
prevent
intrusion
upon
the
sanctum
sanctorum
the
space
inclosed
by
this
portico
is
about
seven
statium
the
foundations
are
broad
and
lofty
and
approached
by
an
extended
flight
of
marble
steps
on
both
sides
without
and
within
no
less
than
four
hundred
and
columns
support
an
arched
entablature
which
is
crowned
by
a
succession
of
domes
surmounted
by
glittering
crescents
the
colonnade
is
quadrangular
and
in
the
four
corners
are
minarés
raising
their
tapering
spires
to
heaven
in
emblem
of
the
ascending
orisons
of
the
faithful
and
from
whose
gilded
galleries
the
sacred
imams
have
since
unnumbered
suns
have
risen
and
set
proclaimed
the
hours
of
adoration
no
gloomy
darkness
ever
enshrouds
this
structure
for
when
day
withdraws
its
more
glaring
brightness
innumerable
lamps
cast
their
fitful
light
around
the
pillars
what
tales
could
these
marble
columns
whisper
of
human
hopes
and
even
holier
aspirations
of
the
wicked
schemes
of
intriguing
imams
as
with
sacerdotal
robes
and
turbans
of
emerald
hue
they
traced
their
cautious
way
from
pillar
to
pillar
and
received
and
blessed
the
vast
concourse
of
souls
borne
down
with
the
ills
and
sins
of
humanity
how
honeyed
their
benedictions
as
they
lay
their
gilded
palms
on
the
humble
suppliant
who
would
gladly
bestow
all
his
earthly
treasures
for
a
sure
hope
of
heaven
where
his
joys
would
be
enduring
poor
weak
mortals
tools
of
each
other
and
victims
of
the
calculating
the
deceiver
and
deceived
on
the
same
journey
on
the
same
race
course
where
the
goal
is
eternity
beneath
these
domes
and
overshadowed
by
these
tall
minarés
the
poet
and
the
scholar
have
met
to
repeat
the
traditions
and
romances
so
peculiar
to
the
glowing
imaginations
of
the
oriental
world
and
to
vie
with
each
other
for
literary
fame
the
astrologer
and
diviner
no
doubt
the
very
genii
and
fairies
of
arabian
myth
have
mingled
in
the
throng
with
what
emotion
have
the
deluded
victims
of
superstition
and
remorse
prostrated
themselves
upon
the
hallowed
ground
and
with
what
ecstatic
faith
in
the
rewards
of
their
holy
pilgrimage
have
the
only
true
believers
kissed
the
dust
of
the
consecrated
earth
within
this
beautiful
portico
there
is
a
vast
space
in
the
middle
of
which
stands
the
caaba
itself
after
adam
was
driven
from
paradise
he
begged
the
almighty
to
allow
him
to
erect
a
or
house
of
god
similar
to
the
one
he
had
seen
there
therefore
the
caaba
was
let
down
to
mecca
directly
under
the
heavenly
temple
this
was
rebuilt
after
the
deluge
by
abram
or
as
some

from
which

how
mystic
and
beautiful
are
the
glimmerings
of
these
lights
as
they
glisten
on
the
dark
night
in
their
silver
lamps
casting
uncertain
shadows
around
the

their

all
arrayed
in

and
sacred
green
to
watch
the

of

the

and
wishing
to
ward
off
from
them
the
dangers
of
sudden
death

the
thousand
other
casualties
of

bestow
a
small
portion
of
the
covering
of
this

imbibed
the
sanctity
of
three
hundred
and

duration
and
therewith
the
power
to
avert
all
such
evils
a
small
amount
of
worldly
wealth
is
sufficient
to
touch
the
heart
of
the
holy
emir
who
grants
this
precious
charm
which
resting
in
the
bosom
of
its
happy
possessor
yields
to
him
a
sweet
repose
from
the
anticipation
of
sudden
trials

outside

this
ancient

unwilling

deface
the

by

scaffolding
when

stood
upon

wonderful
interposition
of

the
stone
raised
him
when
necessary
let
him
down
again

around

down
from

like
other
gems
of

it
was
originally
white
and
shining
but
alas
its
brightness
is
dimmed
and
even
changed
to
perfect
blackness
by
its
contact
with
human
sin
for
ever
since
its
removal
to
this
world
it
has
been
polluted
by
the
touch
of
mortals
and
the
contact

caused

forth
from

no
wonder
that
every
mussulman
whether
commanded

not
should
desire
to
visit
these
sacred
relics
of
antiquity
and
were
it
not
forbidden
doubtless
the
unbelievers
also
would
gladly
undertake
the

pilgrimage
to
witness
the
miraculous
preservation
of
objects

four
caravans
meet
in

called

money
it
is
in

who
goes

provide
himself
with

medium
the
wants

by
a
crowd
of
the
zealous
chanting
hosannas
in

accompanied
by
the
music
of
a
drum
of
antique
contrivance
but
few
can
withhold
a
tribute
the

opens
his

the
widow
adds
her

grandee
and
the
slave

and
all
gladly
answer
the
appeal
of
their
fellows
when
under
a

of
such
sacred
veneration

for
a
cause
so
laudable

the

of

the

thus
for
several
months
at

the
theme
of
all
classes
of
mohammedans
at
length
the
day
arrives
to
begin
the
journey
so
fraught
with
blessings
temporal
and
spiritual
the
conductor
of
the
constantinople
caravan
called
the
surré
emminee
or
the
trustee
of
the
pilgrimage
proceeds
to
the
palace
to
receive
his
commission
from
the
sultan
and
to
him
are
consigned
all
the
treasures
destined
for
mecca
all
hopes
of
worldly
aggrandizement
are
henceforth
renounced
by
this
dignitary
for
having
once
imbibed
the
holy
atmosphere
of
mecca
his
future
aspirations
are
supposed
to
be
only
heavenward
he
therefore
upon
his
return
generally
retires
to
damascus
where
nearer
to
the
shrine
and
in
a
clime
more
genial
for
holiness
he
awaits
his
translation
into
that
paradise
of
which
his
earthly
honors
are
the
type
and
foretaste
quitting
the
august
presence
of
the
thrice
happy
lord
of
the
refulgent
mecca
the
surré
emminee
goes
to
the
porte
where
he
takes
leave
of
his
former
colleagues
in
temporal
greatness
and
thence
to
the
gate
of
the
who
grants
his
blessing
on
the
enterprise
the
pilgrims
and
others
collect
about
him
and
they
proceed
to
bahchai
capusoo
where
a
steamer
is
waiting
to
transport
them
over
to
scutari
in
asia
there
all
along
the
route
are
multitudes
of
people
waiting
to
see
the
procession
the
insignia
of
the
surré
emminee
are
borne
before
him
two
long
poles
to
which
the
expressive
are
attached
and
the
pasha
of
two
tails
follows
on
a
beautiful
arabian
charger
the
treasures
destined
for
mecca
succeed
on
a
train
of
camels
all
bedecked
with
ribbons
and
spangles
but
this
world
grandeurs
are
bestowed
unequally
even
to
these
patient
animals
for
there
is
one
of
their
number
who
outshines
all
his
fellows
a
venerable
camel
is
covered
with
trappings
enriched
with
precious
stones
of
rare
and
sparkling
lustre
for
on
his
back
he
carries
the
sacred
koran
extravagantly
bound
and
enclosed
in
a
golden
box
set
in
brilliants
the
gift
of
the
sultan
to
the
temple
happy
is
this
distinguished
animal
and
his
companions
also
if
they
survive
the
pilgrimage
and
return
for
like
the
surré
emminee
they
are
exempt
from
all
future
toil
in
this
world
and
when
death
at
last
claims
them
for
his
prey
they
enjoy
the
honors
of
a
burial
where
no
rude
dogs
or
vultures
can
disturb
their
remains
the
validé
sultan
or
the
mother
of
the
sultan
reclines
in
her
tahtravan
a
sort
of
elongated
sedan
chair
which
is
suspended
on
long
poles
between
two
camels
and
magnificent
in
proportion
to
the
high
rank
of
its
occupant
mussulman
women
and
children
follow
in
huge
panniers
suspended
on
the
sides
of
camels
horses
and
donkeys
indeed
the
good
fathers
and
husbands
of
the
osmanlis
are
ever
anxious
to
ensure
to
the
female
portion
of
their
families
high
places
in
the
celestial
regions
and
they
are
generally
accompanied
by
their
harems
it
is
incumbent
on
him
whose
family
shall
not
be
present
at
the
holy
temple
to
fast
three
days
in
the
pilgrimage
and
seven
when
he
is
returned
they
shall
be
ten
days
complete
and
the
same
period
of
fasting
is
enjoined
upon
him
who
findeth
not
anything
to
offer
at
the
shrine
mohammed
himself
set
an
example
in
this
respect
for
when
he
encompassed
the
caaba
he
was
accompanied
by
his
family
and
his
wife
kadijah
who
with
his
daughter
fatima
were
two
of
the
four
women
whom
he
pronounced
to
have
attained
a
state
of
perfection
on
this
side
of
the
grave
trains
of
servants
led
horses
and
camels
swell
the
concourse
and
the
whole
is
protected
by
a
body
of
cavalry
about
six
miles
from
scutari
there
is
a
fountain
which
bears
the
name
of
iraluk
cheshmaysee
or
the
fountain
of
separation
thus
far
a
number
of
friends
and
relations
have
accompanied
the
pilgrims
but
as
in
the
journey
of
life
none
can
carry
their
loved
ones
with
them
into
the
celestial
regions
so
these
travellers
who
are
on
an
emblematic
pilgrimage
must
now
sunder
strong
ties
and
loosen
their
hearts
from
earthly
affections
fountain
of
parting
how
are
thy
streams
now
accumulating
as
the
pearly
drops
of
human
woe
trickle
in
among
thy
waters
how
many
days
must
pass
ere
those
waters
regain
their
crystal
brightness
now
all
turbid
with
the
crimson
gushings
of
the
heart
blood
of
fathers
mothers
wives
husbands
and
children
sadly
they
part
some
turn
their
faces
homeward
with
bitter
sighs
while
the
pilgrims
pursue
their
course
every
advancing
step
widening
the
distance
till
their
clouded
eyes
can
discern
no
further
traces
of
the
severed
even
as
faith
reveals
to
the
dying
the
glory
of
a
celestial
world
and
reconciles
the
most
trembling
to
a
passage
from
the
dim
scenes
of
earth
so
does
superstition
foreshadowing
the
hour
of
mortal
dissolution
display
an
earthly
temple
as
the
vestibule
to
the
heavenly
with
eager
steps
the
pilgrims
now
press
onwards
till
they
reach
the
most
ancient
and
beautiful
city
of
damascus
where
they
halt
for
the
caravans
from
bagdad
aleppo
and
the
neighboring
towns
associations
flit
about
this
monument
of
the
wealth
of
the
earliest
founders
of
cities
after
the
universal
deluge
as
the
descendants
of
the
great
survivor
of
the
wreck
of
the
antediluvian
world
sought
out
a
portion
of
the
wide
expanse
of
uninhabited
and
as
yet
uncultivated
earth
this
lovely
valley
of
nature
own
handiwork
seemed
to
invite
their
tarrying
as
it
lay
in
calm
repose
all
fresh
and
verdant
from
the
great
waste
of
waters
perhaps
they
discovered
the
ruins
of
a
great
city
the
remnants
of
ancestral
wealth
or
the
relics
of
the
luxury
and
degeneracy
which
brought
about
the
awful
destruction
of
the
victims
of
the
flood
rapidly
rose
the
proud
city
and
was
famed
even
at
the
time
of
the
first
battle
of
which
there
is
any
record
of
the
five
kings
against
four
the
great
chedorlaomar
and
the
kings
of
sodom
and
gomorrah
when
the
patriarch
abram
went
to
rescue
his
nephew
lot
who
had
been
taken
captive
it
was
the
too
of
eliezer
the
steward
of
abram
who
must
have
been
a
man
of
superior
attainments
as
he
had
the
care
of
all
his
master
possessions
and
even
of
the
betrothal
of
his
beloved
son
isaac
this
ancient
capital
of
syria
did
not
escape
the
enthusiasm
of
moslem
conquest
and
the
great
saracen
generals
and
khaled
took
possession
of
the
famous
city
after
a
slaughter
of
infidels
during
the
reign
of
abubekir
the
successor
of
mohammed
damascus
now
became
the
capital
of
the
ottoman
dominions
and
their
pride
and
glory
for
they
boast
evvely
sham
akhery
sham
or
that
as
they
had
their
beginning
in
sham
or
damascus
so
there
also
they
will
have
their
end
so
precious
do
they
esteem
this
city
that
it
is
styled
the
pearl
surrounded
by
diamonds
and
the
gate
of
the
most
holy
mecca
here
then
at
the
most
beautiful
gate
do
the
pilgrims
to
the
sacred
shrine
delight
to
repose
awhile
their
senses
ravished
with
the
loveliest
enchantments
of
nature
their
eager
vision
extends
over
vast
plains
of
richly
waving
foliage
mingling
with
its
emerald
hues
the
brilliant
tints
of
the
citron
pomegranate
and
fig
sweet
odors
of
aromatic
freshness
pervade
the
balmy
air
while
luscious
and
juicy
fruits
revive
their
thirsty
senses
over
this
vast
and
exquisite
prospect
tower
tall
minarés
and
graceful
domes
with
glittering
crescents
proclaiming
as
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
the
sway
of
mohammed
ressoul

but
there
is
yet
a
weary
way
to
the
shrine
and
the
zealous
throng
now
swelled
to
a
vast
multitude
renew
their
journey
if
the
weather
is
very
oppressive
they
encamp
in
the
and
proceed
by
the
light
of
innumerable
torches
at
night
how
mysterious
the
pageant
stretching
its
long
train
over
the
barren
and
trackless
sands
the
camels
with
stealthy
step
waving
their
long
necks
slowly
and
majestically
now
and
then
the
arabian
coursers
neighing
in
wearied
restlessness
break
the
silence
then
a
voice
chanting
a
hymn
of
praise
and
anon
a
shout
or
chorus
from
the
multitude
now
all
is
still
and
fitful
shadows
glide
along
side
by
side
with
the
wanderers
as
the
bright
jewels
on
the
camels
glisten
in
the
the
caravan
has
passed
leaving
in
its
track
many
palpitating
forms
panting
on
the
sands
for
that
breath
of
life
which
is
rapidly
exhaling
from
their
bodies
so
weary
a
way
sometimes
no
water
to
quench
the
thirst
which
rages
in
proportion
to
the
scarcity
of
its
antidote
fatigue
adding
its
prostrating
effects
day
by
day
no
wonder
that
many
of
the
pilgrims
are
transferred
to
the
heavenly
temple
without
a
sight
of
the
earthly
the
caravan
from
cairo
is
also
moving
onwards
made
up
of
a
motley
multitude
headed
by
the
emir
hadgee
who
is
appointed
by
the
pasha
of
cairo
and
receives
great
emoluments
from
his
office
every
pilgrim
pays
him
a
certain
sum
for
the
enregistering
of
his
name
and
property
and
the
possessions
of
all
those
who
die
on
the
road
are
also
his
perquisites
he
is
the
governor
of
the
pilgrimage
and
is
judge
and
jury
in
all
matters
of
dispute
the
egyptians
always
carry
with
them
the
tomb
of
hassan
and
accompanied
by
cavalry
and
artillery
they
proceed
as
far
as
redowa
near
medina
where
they
are
to
meet
the
constantinople
caravan
about
two
days
journey
from
cairo
they
arrive
at
a
place
called
the
ancient
marah
of
the
israelites
where
when
the
people
murmured
at
the
bitterness
of
the
waters
moses
cast
a
tree
into
them
and
they
became
sweet
of
surpassing
sweetness
to
all
thirsty
pilgrims
thus
they
travel
over
the
same
wilderness
as
their
ancient
predecessors
encamping
in
the
very
spots
selected
by
moses
for
the
tents
of
the
chosen
people
of
god
after
these
caravans
meet
they
proceed
a
vast
multitude
to
a
village
about
sixty
miles
from
mecca
where
is
abram
mountain
on
which
he
erected
the
altar
to
sacrifice
his
son
on
the
top
of
this
hill
is
a
mosque
where
an
old
sheikh
resides
who
as
the
pilgrims
halt
stands
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
and
delivers
an
address
to
them
on
the
importance
of
the
duty
they
are
performing
reminding
them
also
of
the
blessings
in
store
for
all
zealous
mussulmans
to
what
an
immense
audience
does
this
lonely
old
man
once
a
year
proclaim
the
tenets
of
the
koran
and
how
eagerly
do
their
thirsty
souls
quaff
the
water
of
everlasting
life
as
he
dispenses
it
now
the
emir
hadgee
conducts
the
pilgrims
one
by
one
to
the
feet
of
the
sheikh
as
he
stands
in
the
mosque
on
the
top
of
the
hill
rabiie
as
they
enter
one
door
and
pass
out
at
the
other
in
rapid
succession
each
one
is
touched
by
the
divining
rod
in
the
hands
of
the
old
sheikh
and
the
burden
of
all
their
past
transgressions
rolls
from
their
backs
as
he
pronounces
the
words
may
sin
here
leave
thee
lightened
from
the
pressure
of
sin
in
every
form
they
run
swiftly
down
the
hill
and
bathing
their
hands
and
faces
in
a
stream
which
flows
below
they
become
renewed
men
women
and
children
and
prepared
to
gaze
upon
the
holy
city
of
mecca
which
is
not
far
distant
now
turning
their
faces
to
the
shrine
the
true
believers
hasten
on
their
way
sometimes
halting
at
the
tomb
of
eve
which
is
at
giddeh
the
port
of
mecca
this
illustrious
and
ancient
mother
of
the
human
race
must
have
been
a
dame
of
fair
proportions
for
her
grave
measures
from
the
head
to
the
foot
stone
no
less
than
yards
or
english
feet
if
she
was
of
such
exceeding
stature
what
must
have
been
the
dimensions
of
our
great
parent
adam
or
what
lofty
personages
must
have
been
the
giants
of
those
days
after
travelling
about
three
days
longer
the
domes
of
the
holy
temple
are
descried
in
the
distance
when
the
multitude
with
mad
delight
prostrate
themselves
on
the
ground
and
kissing
the
earth
three
times
proclaim
with
tremendous
clamor
la
illah
ill
lallah
mohammed
ressoul
ullah
there
is
no
other
god
but
god
mohammed
the
apostle
of
god
the
artillery
is
now
fired
to
announce
the
arrival
of
the
caravans
to
the
inhabitants
of
mecca
who
headed
by
the
shereef
of
the
city
and
all
the
imams
immediately
proceed
to
meet
the
pilgrims
and
conduct
them
within
the
sacred
precincts
those
who
possess
but
scanty
means
encamp
without
the
city
and
others
are
accommodated
at
khans
which
are
very
numerous
the
next
thing
is
to
visit
the
bath
and
thus
purify
themselves
for
the
ceremonies
at
the
temple
i
will
wash
my
hands
in
innocency
so
will
i
compass
thine
altar
o
lord
having
invested
themselves
in
the
ehram
or
covering
of
crimson
woollen
shag
which
is
always
wrapped
around
the
person
on
this
occasion
they
proceed
to
the
caaba
mohammed
having
performed
these
same
ceremonies
his
followers
have
ever
since
imitated
his
example
immediately
after
the
prophet
took
possession
of
the
city
of
mecca
he
proceeded
to
the
caaba
there
he
stood
upon
the
roof
of
the
house
of
prayer
and
proclaimed
the
first
ezan
or
call
to
prayer
at
he
then
commenced
his
adorations
at
the
shrine
by
first
kissing
the
black
stone
in
the
corner
near
the
door
of
the
caaba
then
he
proceeded
to
compass
the
building
seven
times
and
then
again
kissed
the
stone
when
the
caaba
was
let
down
from
heaven
to
adam
he
requested
that
it
might
be
so
placed
that
he
could
compass
it
as
he
had
seen
the
angels
do
ever
since
the
creation
the
number
seven
has
had
a
mystic
signification
and
its
sacred
meaning
is
demonstrated
in
these
devotions
of
the
faithful
mohammed
then
proclaimed
to
the
people
from
mount
arafat
the
manner
in
which
they
were
to
perform
the
ceremonies
at
the
temple
and
went
to
the
valley
of
mina
where
he
threw
seven
stones
at
the
devil
every
time
pronouncing
the
words
allah
ikbér
allah
ikbér
god
almighty
god
omnipotent
as
did
adam
and
abraham
when
the
great
adversary
interrupted
their
devotions
the
enemies
of
the
prophet
account
for
the
accumulation
of
stones
in
this
valley
by
the
following
story
it
is
well
known
that
mohammed
was
assisted
in
the
preparation
of
the
koran
by
an
armenian
monk
by
name
serkiss
when
their
work
was
completed
the
prophet
wished
to
attest
it
by
a
miracle
he
accordingly
persuaded
serkiss
to
descend
into
a
deep
well
while
he
called
all
the
multitude
to
assemble
holding
a
blank
book
in
his
hand
he
declared
that
if
the
koran
was
indeed
revealed
from
heaven
he
would
drop
this
into
the
well
and
allah
would
send
it
up
all
written
and
inscribed
the
book
descended
and
serkiss
sent
up
the
one
he
had
already
prepared
now
said
mohammed
let
each
man
cast
a
stone
into
the
well
which
will
be
a
monument
to
the
world
whereupon
every
one
of
the
great
concourse
cast
a
stone
and
thus
effectually
prevented
serkiss
from
appearing
to
contradict
the
miracle
ever
since
that
time
the
pilgrims
have
helped
to
accumulate
these
stones
until
a
vast
monument
indeed
has
been
erected
the
prophet
now
offered
the
sacrifice
of
camels
according
to
the
years
of
his
own
life
shaved
his
head
and
having
run
seven
times
between
the
two
hills
safa
and
merwa
in
imitation
of
hagar
searching
for
water
he
completed
the
holy
ceremonies
according
to
this
model
have
the
pilgrims
continued
ever
since
his
time
the
performance
of
these
superstitious
devotions
the
holy
duties
of
the
shrine
being
over
after
a
few
worldly
cares
are
disposed
of
the
now
travellers
turn
their
footsteps
homewards
purified
and
set
apart
henceforth
the
chosen
of
allah
fearless
of
all
danger
as
if
within
the
shadow
of
the
eternal
world
nothing
intimidates
the
followers
of
the
prophet
as
with
the
greatest
they
anticipate
the
rest
of
their
sojourn
in
this
lower
world
many
have
sacrificed
all
their
earthly
possessions
but
are
they
not
sure
of
the
imperishable
riches
of
paradise
with
eager
fondness
they
embrace
once
again
friends
and
relations
while
the
odor
of
sanctity
exhales
from
their
sacred
persons
with
what
panting
bosoms
and
restless
vision
do
the
friends
search
among
the
remnant
returned
from
the
wanderings
for
dear
and
familiar
faces
and
human
wailings
rend
the
air
as
they
are
told
that
brother
sister
and
husband
lie
whitening
on
the
sand
long
ere
this
the
prey
of
the
vulture
the
happy
father
clasps
to
his
breast
his
precious
offspring
and
with
sweet
complacency
ties
around
its
neck
a
morsel
the
holy
covering
of
the
caaba
so
sure
the
charm
and
obtained
at
such
infinite
perils
the
pilgrims
are
surrounded
and
with
jealous
caution
they
bestow
a
few
drops
of
the
water
of
the
holy
well
which
glides
down
the
throats
of
the
faithful
like
the
oily
fountains
of
paradise
the
weary
camels
even
linger
out
their
lives
in
luxurious
idleness
retired
from
oppressive
service
with
an
air
of
unconscious
sanctity
and
repose
henceforward
the
glorious
title
of
hadgee
belongs
to
the
returned
pilgrim
no
razor
profanes
the
beard
and
the
very
door
of
the
house
by
its
hue
of
the
prophet
robe
the
sacred
green
proclaims
the
rank
and
holiness
of
its
master
the
hadgee
with
long
and
solemn
face
never
wearies
of
recounting
his
wonderful
adventures
portraying
with
ecstasy
the
splendors
of
the
shrine
detailing
with
holy
rapture
the
ceremonies
and
devotions
until
the
flame
of
superstitious
zeal
is
enkindled
in
every
bosom
and
their
spirits
yearn
for
the
sweet
sanctity
and
atmosphere
of
the
most
refulgent
mecca
and
many
vows
are
made
that
in
the
coming
year
their
footsteps
shall
surely
be
thitherward
such
then
are
the
illusions
which
beguile
life
wearisome
journey
to
the
followers
of
mohammed
such
the
to
their
future
elysium
thus
the
tortures
of
conscience
are
eased
and
thus
does
superstition
stand
fully
armed
at
the
portals
of
the
soul
few
indeed
are
the
members
of
the
great
human
family
who
dare
to
combat
this
enemy
to
moral
greatness
and
how
small
the
number
of
those
who
renounce
her
sway
chained
down
to
creeds
and
dogmas
the
mind
of
man
seldom
soars
above
the
atmosphere
of
human
inventions
but
relyingly
lingers
in
the
leading
strings
of
bigotry
in
one
form
or
another
thus
is
constituted
the
practice
of
the
mohammedan
religion
ablutions
prayers
alms
fasting
and
the
pilgrimage
to
mecca
which
are
denominated
farz
or
obligatory
there
are
however
many
other
traditional
observances
termed
sünnet
which
as
the
turks
are
sünnees
or
traditionists
they
have
incorporated
with
their
religious
duties
such
as
circumcision
and
many
other
rites
these
rites
whose
observance
is
only
optional
are
however
performed
with
as
much
zeal
and
ceremony
as
those
required
by
the
koran
although
the
ceremony
of
circumcision
is
not
alluded
to
in
the
koran
and
therefore
not
indispensable
yet
it
is
a
custom
generally
observed
and
is
performed
when
the
child
is
able
to
pronounce
the
formula
of
faith
la
illah
ill
allah
mohammed
ressoul
ullah
or
is
about
the
age
of
seven
years
this
is
a
great
festival
and
when
the
sultan
children
or
those
of
any
of
the
grandees
are
the
neophytes
a
general
invitation
is
extended
to
other
candidates
music
dancing
and
feasting
occupy
the
minds
and
distract
the
thoughts
of
the
numerous
company
young
and
old
during
the
week
devoted
to
this
ceremony
chapter
vii
principles
of
the
turkish
government
a
people
descended
from
nomadic
tribes
and
until
very
recently
severed
from
foreign
intercourse
would
naturally
retain
its
simple
and
national
type
besides
the
peculiar
bond
of
an
exclusive
faith
would
still
more
tend
to
the
preservation
of
ancient
and
characteristic
usages
thus
the
osmanlis
have
with
hitherto
but
few
deviations
preserved
their
identity
as
an
eminently
patriarchal
nation
as
the
son
recognized
the
parent
to
be
the
governor
and
controller
of
his
career
the
fountain
of
experience
and
wisdom
and
rendered
to
him
a
willing
and
natural
obedience
so
the
people
needing
such
a
fatherly
care
and
control
were
ready
to
invest
one
of
their
number
with
this
authority
every
system
has
its
centre
the
sun
rules
in
the
heavens
and
the
great
mass
of
humanity
seek
a
centre
around
which
to
rally
the
wonderful
magnetism
of
mortal
emotion
tends
to
a
common
point
as
surely
as
the
needle
to
the
pole
thus
some
species
of
monarchy
whether
elective
or
hereditary
seems
inevitable
to
a
multitude
of
beings
cast
in
human
mould
tribes
were
instituted
in
early
times
each
with
its
patriarch
or
petty
monarch
and
when
for
mutual
strength
or
by
conquest
these
various
tribes
were
combined
the
monarch
with
increasing
subjects
became
more
powerful
and
distinguished
when
the
wandering
tartars
embraced
islamism
their
chief
becoming
the
successor
to
the
caliphate
was
not
only
their
temporal
but
spiritual
head
these
two
elements
of
power
church
and
state
endowed
the
monarch
with
unlimited
sway
beyond
whom
there
could
be
no
appeal
the
simple
patriarch
now
becomes
not
only
the
father
of
his
people
but
the
representative
of
allah
the
sole
controller
of
life
and
death
property
and
religion
years
even
centuries
roll
on
the
scimitar
gains
nation

fertile

the

of
this
vast
concourse
of
men
the
absolute
owner
of
the
domain
far
and
wide
now
rejoices
in
the
adulations
of
his
superstitious
subjects
who
acknowledge
him
as

lord
of

of

though
they
may
seem
somewhat
bombastic
or
even
ridiculous
in
these
days
of
equality
and
freedom
yet
are
not
unparalleled
in
some
of
the
more
civilized
realms
of
modern
europe
nor
without
their
legitimate
influences
upon
the
subjects
of
this
potentate
in
order
to
illustrate
the
wonderful
effect
which
the
assumption
of
such
appellatives
has
upon
the
general
mass
of
the
people
i
will
relate
an
incident
which
happened
to
myself
during
a
recent
sail
on
the
bosphorus
in
a
cayik
and
immediately
after
the
arrival
of
the
allied
fleets
i
thought
to
amuse
myself
with
some
political
with
my
boatman
as
i
was
remarking
about
the
assistance
of
the
allies
the
but
thorough
mussulman
was
very
prompt
in
solving
the
mystery
of
this
political
combination
why
should
two
sets
of
giavours
combine
with
the
true
believers
against
a
third
the
reason
seemed
plain
enough
to
him
the
french
giavours
had
a
new
king
and
since
the
is
the
prince
of
princes
and
lord
of
lords
in
order
to
merit
at
his
hands
the
consummation
of
royalty
they
had
come
to
fight
for
him
bringing
along
england
to
intercede
for
them
chapter

the
administrative
government
although
the
power
and
authority
of
the
sultan
is
unlimited
and
his
sway
entirely
arbitrary
the
disposal
of
affairs
is
naturally
consigned
to
various

the
two
principal
of

are

tutor
because
he
was
the
sole
adviser
to
his
majesty
and
as
he
exercised
the
civil
functions
of
the
executive
he
was
styled
or
vicar
absolute
he
therefore
enjoyed
all
the
rights
and
immunities
of
his
imperial
master
to
the
entire
control
of
property
and

itself
he
used
to

army
in
time
of
war
make
all
appointments
to
office
give
audiences
to
the
foreign
ambassadors
receive
and
answer
their
memorials
and
he
only
of
all
the
ministers
of
the
realm
had
free
access
to
the
royal
presence
as
he
was
amenable
to
no
tribunal
his
only
forfeit
being
his
own
head
and
his
worldly
possessions
it
was
his
policy
to
render
the
person
of
the
sultan
inapproachable
between
whom
and
his
people
a
mystic
veil
seemed
ever
to
depend
by
degrees
the
monarch
who
should
have
been
the
father
of
his
people
removed
from
all
intercourse
with
his
subjects
became
only
the
shrine
of
their
superstitious
devotions
the
deity
of
their
worship
the
proxy
of
allah
while
the
real
administrator
of
the
realm
was
the
selfish
ambitious
scheming
and
grand
vezir
even
on
fridays
as
his
majesty
appeared
in
public
on
his
way
to
the
mosque
he
was
so
surrounded
by
pomp
and
royal
pageantry
as
to
be
almost
invisible
but
since
the
promulgation
of
the
tanzimat
or
reformation
an
entire
change
has
been
effected
in
the
administrative
department
and
a
substantial
check
imposed
upon
the
grand
vezir
whose
former
prerogatives
and
immunities
have
been
much
curtailed
there
is
now
a
council
attached
to
each
department
which
deliberates
upon
the
various
measures
proposed
a
grand
national
council
established
on
a
somewhat
european
system
called
the
or
senate
composed
of
the
dignitaries
and
notables
of
the
nation
and
presided
over
by
a
reiss
or
chief
of
its
own
controls
the
affairs
of
the
nation
in
general
its
duties
are
to
prepare
the
laws
establish
or
revise
the
basis
of
the
taxation
regulate
the
revenues
and
expenditure
of
the
government
to
draft
the
instructions
for
the
governors
of
the
provinces
to
try
all
treasonable
acts
and
crimes
committed
against
the
state
to
correct
the
abuses
of
the
functionaries
to
attend
to
the
complaints
of
citizens
brought
against
the
different
agents
or
authorities
to
draw
up
sentences
for
criminals
which
are
either
maintained
or
modified
by
his
majesty
etc
there
is
another
council
called
the
or
special
council
which
being
composed
of
the
ministers
of
the
different
departments
may
be
termed
a
cabinet
or
privy
council
the
grand
vezir
as
prime
minister
presides
over
this
these
two
councils
together
constitute
what
is
termed
and
generally
known
as
the
or
the
sublime
porte
baab
is
the
arabic
word
for
gate
or
porte
in
french
ever
since
mordecai
sat
in
the
king
gate
and
perhaps
long
before
his
time
all
the
places
of
public
administration
in
the
east
have
been
designated
by
this
term
for
instance
is
the
superior
court
the
war
department
and
in
contradistinction
to
all
the
other
courts
or
departments
the
government
of
the
ottoman
empire
is
denominated
the
or
the
supreme
gate
or
court
a
term
of
similar
significance
with
the
court
of
james
the
tuileries
or
the
government
at
washington
thus
it
will
be
perceived
that
the
original
autocratic
government
has
now
been
reduced
into
a
form
of
bureaucracy
the
vast
empire
of
turkey
partaking
of
the
territories
of
no
less
than
three
continents
is
divided
into
ayalets
or
provinces
each
ayalet
being
into
livas
or
counties
and
each
liva
into
kazas
or
townships
these
provinces
counties
and
townships
are
respectively
governed
by
valis
kaimakams
and
müdirs
the
governors
of
these
provinces
formerly
enjoyed
in
their
respective
domains
the
same
absolute
authority
as
the
grand
vezir
and
answered
with
the
same
forfeiture
of
their
heads
and
property
for
their
misdemeanors
but
of
late
years
the
same
check
has
also
been
put
upon
their
powers
as
in
the
central
government
by
the
establishment
of
councils
all
the
ministers
and
governors
of
provinces
are
now
appointed
by
the
sultan
and
the
secondary
places
are
filled
by
the
appointment
of
the
grand
vezir
when
his
majesty
designs
to
elevate
a
person
to
the
office
of
minister
of
the
realm
one
of
the
chamberlains
of
the
palace
proceeds
to
summon
the
individual
to
the
royal
presence
where
he
is
invested
in
his
new
office
by
the
bestowal
of
the
or
the
badge
of
rank
in
brilliants
which
is
suspended
around
the
neck
and
an
iradé
or
edict
is
granted
him
by
the
sultan
he
then
proceeds
with
much
pomp
and
ceremony
to
the
porte
where
he
is
immediately
recognized
according
to
the
royal
commands
he
is
met
at
the
foot
of
the
stairway
by
the
grand
vezir
in
person
who
bows
to
the
edict
presented
to
him
by
the
chamberlain
with
as
much
reverence
as
if
it
were
his
royal
master
himself
holding
the
document
over
his
head
the
viceroy
enters
the
grand
council
chamber
where
he
reads
it
in
a
loud
voice
and
the
ceremony
is
concluded
by
an
extempore
prayer
offered
by
the
mufty
of
the
council
and
the
new
minister
is
conducted
to
his
gate
or
his
own
department
when
they
are
deposed
from
office
the
royal
chamberlain
appears
demanding
the
nishan
which
is
immediately
relinquished
chapter
ix
the
policy
of
the
government
the
policy
of
the
government
has
hitherto
been
centralization
that
is
to
draw
the
mass
of
the
people
from
the
frontiers
to
a
common
centre
in
order
the
more
readily
to
suppress
any
rebellion
and
by
depopulating
the
borders
to
prevent
the
approach
of
foreign
invasion
besides
even
while
consigning
the
inhabitants
of
the
provinces
to
the
arbitrary
control
of
the
governors
a
certain
degree
of
awe
and
ready
submission
might
be
inspired
towards
the
central
government
which
could
at
pleasure
and
option
punish
with
one
fell
blow
the
very
ruler
who
was
regarded
as
omnipotent
in
his
own
territories
also
it
was
with
ulterior
designs
that
such
a
degree
of
laxity
was
tolerated
the
distant
and
provincial
authorities
in
grasping
all
within
their
reach
and
oppressing
the
people
under
their
control
were
able
to
amass
great
possessions
for
themselves
but
they
were
amenable
to
the
supreme
power
which
availed
itself
of
its
prerogatives
to
judge
and
condemn
upon
the
slightest
accusation
and
to
confiscate
and
appropriate
the
spoils
with
the
semblance
of
justice
itself
as
if
avenging
the
wrongs
of
an
injured
population
notwithstanding
there
was
often
an
assumption
of
independence
in
many
of
the
provincial
authorities
who
succeeded
in
maintaining
the
dignity
of
or
feudal
barons
such
as
tepelene
and
mehmed
aali
the
consequence
has
been
that
as
you
receded
from
the
seat
of
government
over
the
vast
tracts
of
territory
the
very
limited
internal
communications
combined
with
the
independence
and
rapacity
of
the
governors
of
the
distant
provinces
produced
anarchy
misrule
and
misery
in
frightful
ratio
some
amelioration
has
been
attempted
of
late
by
the
tanzimat
or
reformation
and
the
establishing
of
roads
and
councils
but
the
spirit
of
centralization
still
pervades
with
all
its
legitimate
evils
another
equally
pernicious
error
in
their
policy
was
the
idea
that
it
was
better
to
employ
the
heads
and
hands
of
the
people
in
foreign
wars
with
the
view
to
keep
them
constantly
occupied
and
to
maintain
a
military
ardor
although
this
system
contributed
vastly
to
the
extension
of
the
empire
yet
sad
experience
has
developed
its
injurious
effects
for
constant
acquisitions
so
enlarged
their
dominions
and
inflated
the
soldiery
that
the
very
sultan
began
to
tremble
on
his
throne
until
the
destruction
of
the
janissaries
became
indispensable
for
the
preservation
of
the
empire
this
famous
military
body
was
created
in
the
reign
of
sultan
mourad
the
son
and
successor
of
orkhan
and
it
was
notorious
for
many
centuries
till
they
were
at
last
destroyed
by
mahmoud
the
father
of
the
present
sultan
the
janissaries
are
so
interwoven
with
the
past
and
present
history
of
turkey
that
it
does
not
seem
amiss
to
give
here
a
slight
sketch
of
their
origin
and
downfall
chapter
x
history
of
the
janissaries
the
janissaries
were
first
instituted
for
the
protection
of
the
throne
and
person
of
the
sultan
the
army
being
then
composed
of
the
victorious
turkomans
who
had
become
turbulent
and
were
ready
to
take
the
reins
of
government
into
their
own
hands
a
new
militia
was
consequently
instituted
by
mourad
composed
of
young
prisoners
of
war
who
were
brought
up
in
the
moslem
faith
and
in
contradistinction
to
the
existing
army
were
denominated
or
new
soldiers
with
the
design
of
giving
more
solemnity
to
the
new
order
the
founder
resorted
to
the
aid
of
religion
and
they
were
blessed
by
a
famous
sheikh
who
extending
his
arms
over
the
troops
invoked
the
blessing
of
allah
and
predicted
their
future
victories
pronouncing
these
words
let
them
be
called
may
their
countenance
ever
be
bright
their
hand
victorious
their
sword
keen
may
their
spear
always
hang
over
the
head
of
their
enemies
and
wheresoever
they
go
may
they
return
with
a
white
face
their
uniform
consisted
of
loose
trousers
and
long
flowing
robes
tucked
up
their
when
in
full
dress
was
very
peculiar
a
round
cap
of
grey
felt
with
a
long
piece
of
the
same
hanging
behind
in
commemoration
of
the
loose
sleeve
of
the
saint
which
was
suspended
over
their
heads
when
he
extended
his
arms
to
bless
their
institution
they
were
armed
with
sabres
scimitars
pistols
yataghans
muskets
constituting
as
it
were
a
peripatetic
model
arsenal
their
mode
of
warfare
was
quite
primitive
each
fighting
on
his
own
responsibility
from
their
earliest
years
these
christian
slaves
snatched
from
the
bosom
of
their
families
were
inured
to
all
sorts
of
hardships
and
to
perfect
resignation
to
the
will
of
their
superiors
they
were
diligently
trained
in
the
art
of
war
and
every
trace
of
their
parents
and
native
country
being
obliterated
from
their
minds
their
only
aim
was
to
promote
the
interest
and
glory
of
their
lord
and
sultan
and
they
were
for
many
centuries
justly
distinguished
for
the
excellence
of
their
discipline
and
for
their
indomitable
courage
but
owing
to
their
constant
successes
they
at
last
began
to
consider
themselves
invincible
and
by
degrees
becoming
insolent
respected
neither
the
laws
nor
even
the
sultan
himself
they
thus
turned
that
power
which
was
originally
the
defence
and
glory
of
the
country
to
its
ruin
and
destruction
and
many
were
the
sultans
who
fell
victims
to
their
audacity
and
rebellion
sultan
selim
in
his
attempt
to
reform
them
was
sacrificed
to
their
fury
they
were
in
reality
the
ruling
power
in
the
country
dethroning
sultans
and
taking
off
the
heads
of
ministers
at
their
will
they
were
upheld
in
all
their
excesses
by
the
people
from
a
dread
of
their
vengeance
many
of
whom
from
motives
of
personal
safety
even
enlisted
as
honorary
members
of
their
corps
for
even
the
assassin
could
find
a
secure
asylum
in
their
barracks
from
which
no
power
or
authority
could
claim
him
nothing
was
sacred
in
their
estimation
families
dared
not
to
venture
abroad
without
a
janissary
escort
and
on
this
account
the
different
foreign
embassies
were
always
accommodated
with
two
or
three
of
their
number
which
custom
is
still
in
vogue
though
kavasses
or
turkish
police
officers
have
been
substituted
for
the
janissaries
of
former
times
even
the
royal
harem
was
not
safe
from
them
and
neither
life
nor
property
were
secure
from
their
depredations
besides
their
regular
rations
their
pay
was
at
the
rate
of
from
one
asper
to
twenty
according
to
their
rank
per
day
an
asper
was
at
that
time
equal
to
one
cent
of
federal
money
but
they
had
various
ways
of
increasing
their
personal
revenues
they
assumed
a
peculiar
style
of
taxing
the
peaceable
citizens
by
carelessly
tossing
their
handkerchiefs
at
them
with
an
intimation
that
their
pockets
needed
replenishing
and
none
dared
to
return
the
handkerchief
without
a
tribute
tied
in
one
of
its
corners
those
who
were
stationed
in
the
city
as
metropolitan
guards
generally
contrived
to
amass
a
quantity
of
mud
before
the
guardhouse
which
they
would
ask
all
the
rayahs
who
passed
by
either
to
sweep
away
or
contribute
something
for
its
removal
the
day
of
their
revolt
was
most
memorable
and
our
own
janissary
boatman
coolly
put
the
number
and
mark
of
his
regiment
upon
the
of
our
residence
as
an
intimation
to
his
comrades
that
the
house
was
already
appropriated
by
one
of
the
brotherhood
assassination
was
a
matter
of
frequent
occurrence
in
those
days
the
father
of
the
writer
once
narrowly
escaped
with
his
life
he
happened
to
be
passing
by
a
shop
where
a
janissary
was
examining
a
yataghan
with
a
view
of
purchasing
it
stop
cried
the
janissary
to
him
come
here
i
want
to
test
this
blade
on
you
he
knew
the
character
of
those
villains
too
well
to
suppose
that
the
rascal
was
joking
as
a
forlorn
hope
he
indifferently
remarked
that
it
would
be
hardly
worth
the
while
to
try
such
an
exquisite
blade
on
my
old
tottering
body
at
the
same
time
suggesting
that
it
would
be
better
for
his
excellency
to
accept
the
sword
as
a
gift
with
the
view
of
trying
it
on
some
worthier
subject
and
throwing
the
money
to
the
merchant
the
old
gentleman
very
suddenly
disappeared
imbued
with
the
wildest
fanaticism
and
with
all
the
prejudices
of
ancient
times
and
habituated
to
command
rather
than
to
obey
these
janissaries
constituted
the
most
effectual
barrier
to
all
progress
or
national
reform
indeed
their
outrageous
conduct
was
often
the
principal
cause
of
war
with
foreign
nations
and
a
stigma
upon
their
country
any
monarch
then
who
appreciated
the
real
interest
of
his
subjects
and
could
anticipate
the
future
downfall
of
his
country
would
be
impelled
to
annihilate
this
scourge
eternal
gratitude
is
due
to
the
illustrious
mahmoud
who
at
last
accomplished
this
task
a
man
of
remarkable
energy
and
discernment
more
inspired
with
the
spirit
of
civilization
and
modern
reform
than
any
of
his
predecessors
with
a
determination
and
perseverance
unparalleled
in
the
history
of
his
country
mahmoud
effected
this
coup
and
has
justly
been
designated
of
glorious
memory
he
first
gained
over
to
himself
the
renowned
hüssein
pasha
who
was
then
the
agha
or
chief
of
the
janissaries
then
or
the
chief
of
the
artillery
and
the
head
of
the
with
the
of
these
personages
a
system
of
military
reform
was
ordered
requiring
all
the
soldiery
to
be
regularly
drilled
and
to
adopt
a
certain
uniform
better
suited
to
military
life
than
the
flowing
robes
and
cumbersome
head
gears
they
had
hitherto
worn
the
artillery
corps
and
the
cheerfully
submitted
to
this
order
but
the
janissaries
considered
this
change
of
costume
as
an
innovation
upon
long
established
customs
and
averse
to
any
military
discipline
there
arose
great
dissatisfaction
among
them
and
as
usual
they
commissioned
the
their
representative
to
remonstrate
with
his
majesty
upon
whose
refusal
to
listen
to
their
murmurs
they
determined
on
rebellion
having
no
suspicions
of
their
chief
according
to
his
counsel
and
public
proclamation
the
janissaries
all
assembled
in
their
own
barracks
at
the
great
square
of
nearly
in
the
centre
of
the
city
to
be
in
readiness
to
resist
any
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
sultan
to
enforce
his
edict
the
sultan
being
informed
of
this
circumstance
he
on
his
part
issued
a
proclamation
that
all
good
mussulmans
should
repair
to
the
holy
standard
of
the
prophet
in
the
court
of
the
seraglio
this
standard
is
never
brought
out
except
in
cases
of
great
emergency
and
no
mussulman
would
refuse
to
repair
to
it
when
summoned
accordingly
all
the
mussulman
citizens
the
artillery
and
the
who
hated
the
janissaries
assembled
at
the
seraglio
and
proceeded
in
a
body
to
the
great
rallying
point
of
the
rebels
where
they
met
with
a
warm
reception
from
the
barrack
windows
of
the
janissaries
who
confident
in
their
own
sheltered
position
were
sure
of
a
glorious
victory
but
they
were
soon
undeceived
for

pieces

transported
to

doors

whose
first
discharge
shattered

gates
and
prostrated
hundreds
of
the
rebels
the
janissaries
now
desperate
rushed
to
seize
the
cannon
which
were
just
reloading
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
heroic
action
of
at
this
critical
emergency
all
would
have
been
lost
the
brave
general
perceiving
the
nature
of
the
affair
and
although
wounded
as
he
was
in
the
thigh
promptly
jumped
from
his
horse
and
seizing
the
torch
instantly
applied
it
to
the
cannon
and
thus
baffling
the
attempts
of
the
assailants
soon
turned
the
scale
of
fortune
all
resistance
was
now
rendered
futile
by
the
barracks
being
set
on
fire
when
amidst
shrieks
of
agony
the
miserable
wretches
were
on
the
of
june
destroyed
many
among
them
were
allowed
to
effect
their
escape
with
the
design
of
sparing
the
innocent
the
most
dangerous
of
their
number
were
afterwards
arrested
and
sent
to
the
european
castles
on
the
bosphorus
where
their
doom
was
sealed
by
the
and
thus
perished
this
formidable
scourge
of
the
ottoman
empire
many
censures
and
much
opprobrium
have
been
cast
upon
the
memory
of
mahmoud
for
this
act
of
consummate
destruction
he
has
been
stigmatized
as
cruel
and
whereas
his
whole
country
was
groaning
under
a
scourge
of
tremendous
power
in
the
shape
of
an
unlicensed
soldiery
day
by
day
the
monster
grew
in
strength
and
threatened
the
utter
annihilation
of
both
sovereign
and
people
what
greater
act
of
humanity
then
than
to
crush
the
hydra
with
one
fell
blow
by
this
act
mahmoud
not
only
established
his
own
sovereign
authority
but
bursting
for
the
first
time
the
bonds
of
barbarism
made
a
bold
stride
towards
the
platform
of
civilization
and
the
fraternity
of
the
world
but
for
mahmoud
turkey
would
perhaps
have
ere
this
been
only
a
record
of
the
past
the
army
was
immediately
and
the
soldiers
were
trained
in
european
tactics
by
distinguished
foreign
officers
they
attained
great
distinction
as
infantry
and
and
still
greater
progress
would
have
been
made
in
military
science
had
it
not
been
for
the
intrigues
of
russia
who
just
at
that
period
availing
herself
of
the
forlorn
condition
of
the
country
found
a
favorable
opportunity
for
declaring
war
the
allies
of
the
present
day
not
discerning
the
muscovite
cunning
were
quiet
spectators
of
the
affray
and
became
as
it
were
silent
partners
in
the
shameful
treaty
of
adrianople
for
which
they
have
since
paid
so
dearly
but
the
janissaries
were
not
the
sole
barriers
to
the
civilization
of
the
country
the
ulema
or
the
expounders
of
the
faith
have
exercised
even
greater
influence
over
the
minds
of
the
superstitious
people
through
their
unlimited
spiritual
authority
chapter
xi
spiritual
branch
of
the
government
turkey
is
a
country
where
church
and
state
are
most
eminently
combined
the
standard
of
every
measure
or
act
is
the
koran
the
administration
of
affairs
both
civil
and
religions
must
therefore
be
in
conformity
with
the
precepts
of
that
sacred
book
but
since
that
book
does
not
provide
for
all
emergencies
and
in
many
instances
is
not
even
explicit
those
who
made
the
koran
their
special
study
have
ever
been
consulted
and
all
matters
referred
to
them
for
examination
and
sanction
the
entire
body
of
these
ecclesiastics
are
denominated
the
ulema
or
learned
in
the
koran
and
their
expositions
are
termed
fetvas
these
fetvas
constitute
as
it
were
the
statutes
of
the
state
the
sanction
of
these
doctors
in
every
measure
being
essential
each
civil
tribunal
is
supplied
with
one
of
their
number
in
order
that
their
acts
may
be
valid
hence
even
the
who
only
represents
the
sultan
in
temporal
matters
is
associated
with
the
chief
of
the
ulema
the
who
on
his
part
personifies
his
majesty
in
spiritual
affairs
bearing
the
title
of
or
the
grand
expositor
his
approval
is
necessary
even
to
the
measures
of
the
great
viceroy
himself
for
no
law
can
be
promulgated
without
his
sanction
considering
then
the
importance
attached
to
the
study
of
the
koran
and
the
benefit
derived
from
a
full
knowledge
of
its
spirit
and
contents
which
constitute
the
basis
of
the
law
and
government
many
have
been
induced
to
adopt
it
as
a
profession
there
are
no
less
than
forty
thousand
of
these
ulema
in
constantinople
these
men
are
of
very
low
origin
and
are
generally
the
sons
of
poor
peasants
they
come
to
constantinople
and
enlist
themselves
as
softas
or
students
of
divinity
or
law
which
are
synonymous
terms
in
one
of
the
principal
mosques
where
they
go
through
a
regular
course
of
study
they
receive
no
salary
but
are
allowed
one
loaf
of
bread
a
day
and
partake
of
such
food
as
is
gratuitously
distributed
to
the
poor
from
the
imarets
or
charitable
institutions
which
are
attached
to
all
the
principal
mosques
when
they
are
proficients
in
writing
they
are
allowed
to
copy
the
koran
in
the
original
arabic
which
it
has
hitherto
been
considered
sacrilege
to
print
or
translate
and
by
the
sale
of
these
copies
they
gain
a
livelihood
they
are
afterwards
promoted
either
to
the
office
of
imams
officiating
priests
or
to
that
of
kadis
and
mollahs
district
judges
or
muftis
or
expounders
of
the
law
the
acme
of
their
ambition
is
to
become
either
chaplain
to
his
majesty
chief
justice
or
high
pontiff
of
the
realm
this
latter
personage
is
considered
by
the
mussulmans
as
an
undoubted
oracle
in
all
instances
though
the
sultan
is
the
head
of
both
church
and
state
yet
the
being
appointed
for
life
and
exempted
from
capital
punishment
his
authority
through
the
superstition
of
the
people
has
been
most
arbitrary
and
even
sometimes
controlled
the
actions
of
the
executive
and
it
has
only
happened
in
our
day
that
in
order
to
assert
the
entire
supremacy
of
the
sultan
the
has
for
the
first
time
in
the
annals
of
the
nation
been
deposed
from
his
sacred
office
and
another
substituted
in
his
place
the
ulema
are
not
supported
by
the
government
but
by
the
income
of
the
mosques
which
are
largely
endowed
by
religious
devotees
those
who
are
in
the
civil
employment
receive
however
fixed
salaries
from
the
state
in
addition
to
their
own
ecclesiastical
income
the
real
estates
owned
by
the
mosques
are
immense
and
beyond
calculation
they
are
called
vakuf
in
contradistinction
to
other
lands
of
the
government
termed
mülk
these
vakuf
lands
which
comprise
more
than
of
the
empire
are
sold
as
under
a
perpetual
lease
with
a
yearly
tax
or
rent
and
all
improvements
made
on
them
are
considered
to
belong
by
right
to
the
land
and
not
allowed
to
be
removed
in
case
of
the
death
of
a
proprietor
leaving
no
male
heirs
the
property
with
all
the
improvements
thereon
reverts
to
the
mosque
the
documents
by
which
these
lands
are
held
are
so
carelessly
registered
and
transferred
that
disputes
are
almost
unavoidable
for
instance
a
deed
is
thus
drawn
up
a
b
has
purchased
of
c
d
a
piece
of
land
belonging
to
such
a
vakuf
said
to
contain
about
acres
more
or
less
that
is
it
might
range
from
to
or
acres
since
its
limits
are
not
fixed
by
any
actual
survey
or
specified
by
a
map
but
the
boundaries
are
described
in
the
most
primitive
style
by
sensible
objects

on

other
the

of
so
and
so
on
the
third
and
the

road
on
the
fourth
this
system
has
hitherto
proved
most
advantageous
to
the
vakufs
the
peculiar
elasticity
of
such
indefinite
boundaries
admitting
of
great
territorial
trespass
upon
adjoining
lands
until
they
have
succeeded
in
absorbing
of
the
empire
strangers
are
not
allowed
to
own
these
lands
nor
hold
them
in
trust
with
the
view
to
avoid
litigation
with
the
different
foreign
embassies
there
has
not
therefore
been
hitherto
any
inducement
to
european
emigration
to
the
introduction
of
foreign
capital
nor
encouragement
to
internal
improvements
the
mosques
derive
an
immense
revenue
both
from
the
rents
of
these
estates
and
the
commission
on
sales
which
is
enormous
being
no
less
than
per
cent
on
each
transfer
with
such
a
percentage
were
the
sale
repeated
fifteen
times
the
original
cost
of
the
land
would
be
doubled
so
that
there
is
an
effectual
check
upon
land
speculation
apart
from
this
the
vakuf
system
is
ruinous
both
to
the
community
and
to
the
government
if
a
man
wants
to
raise
a
sum
of
money
by
mortgaging
his
property
for
three
months
only
besides
the
customary
interest
of
the
country
which
is
per
he
has
to
bear
the
enormous
expense
of
the
transfer
and
retransfer
which
amounts
as
has
been
said
to
per
cent
this
added
to
the
per
the
interest
for
the
three
months
making
altogether
no
less
than
per
cent
for
three
months
this
is
not
all
the
natives
not
being
allowed
the
privilege
of
borrowing
foreign
funds
by
mortgaging
their
own
property
are
reduced
to
the
necessity
of
resorting
to
their
own
capitalists
who
usually
demand

per
cent
a

the
whole
of
this
vakuf
land
or
church
property
occupied
and
unoccupied
pays
no
taxes
so
that
a
most
profitable
source
of
revenue
is
unavailable
to
the
government
the
immense
incomes
of
the
vakufs
are
partly
appropriated
to
the
erection
of
mosques
hospitals
schools
fountains

and
other
charitable
institutions
and
above
all
to
the

there

an

of

vessels
of
war
are
noble
specimens
of
naval
architecture
for
ever
since
the
beautiful
models
built
by
ekford
and
his
successors
rhodes
and
beeves
have
floated
upon
their
waters
a
wonderful
impetus
has
been
given
to
the

of
the
osmanlis
and
the
prow
of
almost
every
vessel
bears
the
impress
of
american
ingenuity

vessels
of

lie
all
along

fully
manned
and
equipped
but
so
seldom
are
they
in
action
or
so
rarely
do
they
sail
beyond
the
ocean
stream
that
the
men
are
utterly
without
the
incitement
of
any
real
engagements
and
unused
to
rougher
seas
so
that
if
perchance
they
are
called
into
active
service
more
than
half
of
them
are
confined
to
their
hammocks
thus
the
lamentable
occurrence
at
sinope
may
be
accounted
for
the
squadron
having
been
obliged
to
anchor
there
on
its
way
to
batoum
because
nearly
all
the
sailors
were
the
officers
themselves
are
illiterate
and
ignorant
of
the
science
of
navigation
it
is
true
that
some
few
have
been
educated
in
the
british
navy
who
are
now
distinguished
in
the
turkish
marine
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
many
of
the
scholars
of
the
new
naval
academy
will
hereafter
elevate
the
character
of
their
nation
on
the

though
there
are
not
the
same
incentives
to
maritime
emulation
as
exist
in

and

even
in

commerce
the

including
that
of

and
the

principalities
amounted
in
to
imports

having
no

the
whole

and
great
part
of

internal
trade
is
carried
on
by
foreign
vessels
whose
aggregate
tonnage
amounts
to
annually
and
they
are
admitted
to
her
ports
at
small
charges
the
tariff
of
turkey
is
but
nominal
being
only
three
per
cent
on
all
exports
and
two
per
cent
additional
as
consumptive
duty
making
altogether
five
per
cent
on
their
value
this
principle
is
not
however
purely
from
liberal
motives
but
the
result
of
foreign
compulsion
and
their
own
ignorance
of
political
economy
for
in
their
anxiety
to
counterbalance
the
deficiencies
of
the
treasury
caused
by
unjust
treaties
extorted
from
them
by
foreign
powers
they
have
imposed
a
duty
of
no
less
than
thirteen
per
cent
on
all
their
produce
or
exports
so
that
when

material
the

direct
and

taxes
on
the

and
the
onerous
export
duty
are
together
taken
into
consideration
the
cost
of
the
produce
is
in
effect
raised
to
about
or
per

it

considered
as

produce
and
a
new
duty
of
per
cent
collected
thereon
the
tariff
is
regulated
every
seven
years
and
the
value
of
the

articles
is
determined
by
a
commission
of
merchants
representing

different
nations
each
of
whom

to
maintain

one
of
these
gentlemen
exultingly
boasted
that

was
made
as
he
had
succeeded
in
establishing
a
low
valuation
on
a
certain
article
in
which
he
dealt
very
largely

no

in

body
though
her
commerce
has
especially
of
late
been
rapidly
increasing
with
this

it
has
only
been
through
ignorance
of

its

that

made
so

chapter
xv
jurisprudence
in
europe
and
america
disputes
often
involve
a
process
of
tedious
litigation
it
is
not
so
in
turkey
although
the
koran
and
its
voluminous
commentaries
decide
every
case
from
a
point
of
faith
to
a
right
of
gutter
yet
the
form
of
trial
is
so
simple
that
it
becomes
quite
expeditious
for
all
turkish
jurisprudence
may
be
condensed
into
these
two
principles
in
every
case
of
litigation
the
testimony
of
two
witnesses
is
required
of
the
plaintiff
and
in
default
of
witnesses
an
oath
is
administered
to
the
defendant
as
the
only
alternative
no
written
document
except
judicial
is
considered
valid
or
recognized
by
the
courts
unless
it
be
substantiated
by
two
witnesses
for
instance
a
banker
had
advanced
to
the
treasury
about
on
account
of
a
certain
pasha
who
farmed
a
province
from
the
government
before
the
year
was
out
the
pasha
died
and
the
court
of
chancery
taking
charge
of
the
estate
of
the
deceased
it
became
necessary
to
examine
and
settle
the
banker
account
current
with
the
defunct
on
examination
it
was
found
that
the
banker
had
paid
to
the
treasury
the
above
mentioned
sum
in
different
installments
and
received
from
the
deceased
only
so
that
there
was
a
balance
due
the
banker
of
but
the
court
of
chancery
would
not
recognize
the
disbursements
of
the
banker
in
behalf
of
the
deceased
unless
each
of
the
installments
made
by
the
banker
to
the
government
could
be
substantiated
by
two
witnesses
thus
requiring
no
less
than
witnesses
for
the
case
it
was
in
vain
the
banker
produced
the
vouchers
of
the
government
regularly
signed
and
sealed
by
the
proper
authorities
the
judges
would
admit
nothing
but
the
requisite
witnesses
and
in
default
of
such
witnesses
claimed
from
the
banker
the
the
receipt
of
which
was
avowed
by
him
and
consequently
due
to
the
heirs
nor
is
this
mode
of
justice
primitive
as
it
is
ever
used
with
impartiality
witnesses
are
never
subpoenaed
by
the
courts
and
no
oath
is
required
of
them
for
the
truth
of
their
depositions
also
on
account
of
the
spirit
of
fanatical
animosity
which
exists
mutually
between
the
christians
and
mohammedans
no
unbiased
testimony
is
to
be
procured
indeed
formerly
the
christians
were
not
even
allowed
to
appear
as
witnesses
the
judges
themselves
being
men
of
low
birth
and
grovelling
principles
only
hold
their
offices
as
sources
of
personal
emolument
as
the
wealth
of
various
of
these
functionaries
fully
attests
the
late
islam
at
his
death
left
the
sultan
by
bequest
nearly
a
million
of
dollars
although
strictly
prohibited
by
the
koran
they
are
in
the
constant
habit
of
receiving
bribes
to
any
amount
notwithstanding
the
precepts
of
their
religion
which
are
ever
and
anon
held
up
as
barriers
to
all
reform
they
are
so
corrupted
that
their
consciences
are
immediately
lulled
whenever
the
requisite
bonus
is
slily
slipped
under
the
cushions
on
which
they
sit
and
the
testimony
of
hired
witnesses
is
then
winked
at
by
them
and
even
supported
as
their
interest
may
demand
the
only
qualification
requisite
for
a
witness
to
appear
before
these
courts
of
justice
is
to
be
omniscient
and
never
to
utter
the
fatal
word
bilmem
i
do
know
when
conflicting
interests
occur
which
induce
the
judges
to
take
side
against
the
witnesses
and
such
occasions
are
by
no
means
rare
since
justice
is
not
only
put
up
at
auction
but
a
single
recommendation
from
a
grandee
suffices
to
turn
the
scale
the
scene
is
truly
farcical
and
its
sketch
worthy
of
the
pen
of
dickens
himself
the
kadis
adopt
a
singular
method
to
disqualify
the
testimony
the
questions
which
are
put
in
the
are
not
only
entirely
irrelevant
to
the
subject
matter
in
dispute
but
would
even
puzzle
the
cutest
yankee
how
to
answer
their
object
is
to
disqualify
the
testimony
by
questions
no
matter
how
ridiculous
but
by
which
the
witnesses
will
be
forced
at
last
to
utter
the
ominous
word
bilmem
i
do
know
with
a
view
to
ascertain
whether
the
witnesses
are
well
acquainted
with
the
party
in
whose
behalf
they
are
testifying
they
are
asked
who
was
the
grandfather
of
the
plaintiff
the
usual
and
formal
answer
in
such
cases
is
abraham
meaning
the
old
patriarch
his
great
grandfather
adam
beyond
whom
he
the
plaintiff
is
not
supposed
to
have
any
ancestors
on
a
certain
occasion
a
judge
being
very
anxious
to
defeat
the
testimony
of
a
clever
witness
after
various
ingenious
interrogatories
made
the
quaint
inquiry
who
married
adam
and
eve
to
which
the
witness
unhesitatingly
replied
not
as
it
may
be
supposed
i
know
oh
no
not
so
stupid
as
that
but
i
was
not
invited
to
the
wedding
it
was
a
maxim
of
the
government
and
a
profitable
one
to
its
employés
that
in
the
administration
of
justice
a
speedy
infliction
of
punishment
even
though
unjust
was
more
desirable
than
a
tedious
course
of
litigation
as
the
fear
and
awe
thus
infused
into
the
hearts
of
the
people
rendered
them
submissive
to
the
most
irrational
commands
and
terrified
the
mass
into
a
dread
of
infringing
the
laws
although
some
few
might
suffer
unjustly
this
principle
though
nominally
abandoned
by
the
government
is
still
maintained
by
the
judiciary
therefore
no
pleading
by
lawyers
is
allowed
and
the
sentence
is
passed
with
all
possible
dispatch
or
deferred
at
pleasure
as
circumstances
may
require
the
whole
of
turkey
is
divided
into
two
separate
judicial
districts
anadolou
and
roumely
or
asia
and
europe
and
there
is
a
or
chief
justice
appointed
to
each
district
who
preside
over
their
respective
courts
there
is
however
a
supreme
court
called
or
court
of
appeals
where
the
grand
vezir
and
the
grand
mufty
conjointly
preside
and
there
all
cases
when
appealed
are
heard
but
the
sentences
are
seldom
reversed
as
they
wish
to
preserve
the
decisions
of
the
judiciary
courts
inviolable
when
the
injustice
is
too
gross
and
palpable
a
new
ilam
or
sentence
is
granted
by
this
court
without
any
allusion
to
prior
proceedings
it
is
true
that
the
people
have
the
right
to
appeal
to
his
majesty
for
redress
but
as
they
are
invariably
referred
to
this
court
for
reconsideration
justice
is
seldom
rendered
to
the
appellants
foreigners
are
not
tried
before
these
courts
if
the
litigation
is
between
themselves
their
cases
are
tried
and
settled
by
their
legations
but
if
with
the
natives
they
are
referred
to
a
special
court
of
the
ministry
of
commerce
called
composed
of
various
merchants
both
natives
and
foreigners
and
presided
over
by
the
minister
of
commerce
or
his
deputy
the
code
by
which
this
body
pretends
to
be
governed
is
the
code
de
commerce
of
napoleon
how
equitably
it
is
applied
by
them
may
easily
be
perceived
imagine
some
or
thirty
merchants
of
different
nations
and
tongues
assembled
together
in
the
character
of
jurors
who
not
only
do
not
understand
a
word
or
syllable
that
is
uttered
in
their
hearing
but
often
do
not
even
possess
the
means
of
communicating
their
ideas
to
each
other
the
affair
brought
before
them
being
unintelligible
to
most
of
them
it
is
generally
conducted
by
the
government
officials
or
some
of
the
members
who
are
fortunate
enough
to
know
something
of
the
language
and
their
decisions
imparted
to
the
passive
members
who
usually
give
their
sanction
taking
it
for
granted
that
all
is
right
the
consequence
is
that
if
one
of
the
litigants
is
so
happy
as
to
secure
the
good
will
and
patronage
of
an
acting
member
he
is
sure
to
come
off
successfully
no
matter
how
bad
his
case
this
body
like
the
other
turkish
courts
admits
not
the
pleading
by
lawyers
for
a
good
and
simple
reason
that
its
members
being
men
of
business
and
ignorant
of
law
and
legality
prefer
to
be
governed
by
their
own
judgment
and
constitute
themselves
at
once
judge
jury
and
prosecutors
the
interpreters
of
the
foreign
legations
are
however
required
by
treaty
to
be
present
who
not
only
interpret
for
the
parties
but
are
bound
to
defend
and
protect
their
fellow
citizens
to
the
best
of
their
ability
and
report
thereupon
to
their
respective
ambassadors
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
the
services
of
these
individuals
are
not
always
disinterested
policy
sometimes
inclines
them
to
side
with
this
court
for
the
sake
of
keeping
on
good
terms
with
the
officials
and
its
members
and
thus
maintaining
their
own
reputations
at
the
porte
as
emissaries
of
foreign
lands
while
at
the
same
time
a
good
opportunity
is
offered
them
for
the
gratification
of
any
personal
pique
or
prejudice
against
their
clients
so
that
a
foreigner
may
either
suffer
injustice
or
be
injurious
to
the
people
of
the
country
without
the
knowledge
of
his
own
ambassador
how
true
then
the
observation
of
lord
stratford
that
the
very
atmosphere
of
turkey
is
impregnated
with
venality
the
costs
of
lawsuits
are
always
defrayed
by
the
gainer
of
the
cause
as
he
is
supposed
to
be
better
able
to
afford
such
expenses
but
the
evident
design
is
to
induce
people
to
go
to
law
since
justice
is
set
aside
and
every
facility
afforded
by
the
suborning
of
witnesses
even
the
sentences
are
so
carelessly
nay
designedly
worded
that
at
any
time
flaws
may
be
discovered
and
a
new
trial
demanded
the
equity
of
making
the
gainer
of
the
cause
pay
the
costs
was
ludicrously
illustrated
in
the
case
of
an
arnavout
or
albanian
who
was
accused
of
stealing
a
gimlet
when
in
the
presence
of
the
kadi
he
pleaded
not
guilty
the
plaintiff
according
to
law
was
required
to
substantiate
his
accusation
by
producing
two
witnesses
the
man
was
in
a
dilemma
for
he
had
no
witnesses
to
produce
but
as
usual
he
was
relieved
from
the
anxiety
by
the
prompt
offer
of
those
harpies
who
linger
about
mehkemes
or
courts
of
justice
and
tender
their
benevolent
services
in
such
emergencies
for
certain
remuneration
moderate
as
was
their
demand
the
trifling
claim
not
justifying
much
extra
expense
he
modestly
declined
availing
himself
of
this
privilege
and
pleaded
to
have
no
witnesses
the
only
alternative
then
for
the
kadi
was
to
administer
the
oath
to
the
defendant
which
was
unhesitatingly
complied
with
for
the
arnavouts
are
generally
noted
for
their
pliable
consciences
thus
having
been
duly
sworn
our
hero
was
pronounced
the
happy
gainer
of
the
cause
and
requested
to
pay
only
the
costs
which
were
ten
times
more
than
the
value
of
the
article
in
question
the
arnavout
being
somewhat
of
a
speculative
genius
after
due
consideration
of
the
pros
and
cons
in
the
case
coolly
put
his
hand
in
his
bosom
and
producing
the
disputed
gimlet
threw
it
at
his
accuser
saying
there
have
your
gimlet
be
you
the
gainer
of
the
cause
and
pay
the
costs
as
to
criminal
laws
they
can
not
be
said
to
exist
in
turkey
for
this
form
of
justice
being
based
upon
the
principle
of
retaliation
or
kissass
the
prosecution
is
always
on
account
of
the
injured
party
and
not
of
the
government

the

are
thus
duly

though
the
instruction
of
the

is
by
private

the
system
of
instruction
in
the
turkish
schools
is
eminently
primitive
and
the

taught
are
very
elementary
they
use
neither

the

of

requiring

that

requisite

the

of

of

and
the

in
committing

to

in

this

they

in

especially
of

can
read

correctly
all

being
performed

the

for

of

whose

are

for

of

these

to

near

in
many
other
places
to
those
who
knew
not
how
to
affix
their

a

not

became
a
convenient
substitute
but
the

have
their

the

officiates
in
this
capacity
to
the

the
common
punishment
at
schools
is
the
world
renowned
bastinado
or
falaka
the
apparatus
consists
of
a
cylindrical
piece
of
wood
about
five
feet
long
and
one
inch
in
diameter
near
the
centre
of
this
rod
there
is
a
loop
of
rope
sufficiently
wide
to
hold
both
the
feet
of
the
truant
the
rod
being
turned
the
rope
winds
upon
it
and
thus
secures
the
feet
which
are
placed
therein
the
person
is
then
thrown
upon
his
back
by
the
raising
of
the
feet
upon
the
soles
of
which
the
blows
are
applied
with
a
cudgel
by
the

it
is
a
rather
painful
operation
as
some
can
tell
from
sad
experience
who
like
other
boys
that
are
never
naughty
had
to
go
through
with
it
in
their
younger
days
the
turkish
originally
tartar
is
at
present
composed
of
three
different
languages
viz
arabic
persian
and
tartar
owing
to
the
different
people
with
whom
the
turcomans
came
in
contact
the
koran
being
their
fundamental
study
the
arabic
has
become
the
basis
of
the
language
as
the
latin
is
of
the
european
dialects
it
is
written
from
right
to

like
all
other
oriental
languages
with
the
exception
of
the
armenian
the
turkish
has
no
capitals
or
roman
letters
but
consists
of
italics
or
in
other
words
the
written

have
the

nor
have
they
any

their
calligraphy
may
be
divided
into
five
different

is
used
in

courts
and
for

siyakat

the

is
in
itself
most
copious
and
expressive
euphonious
in
sound
and
capable
of
the
greatest
variety
of
expression
and
is
well
adapted
to
the
composition
of

although
the
osmanlis
formerly
possessed
but
little
mathematical
philosophical
or
scientific
learning
the

have
never
denied
their
inspiration
to
them
foreign
literature
has
been
much
in
vogue
in
latter
times
and
many
translations
have
been
made
into

the

to
some
extent
and
many

quite
fluently
the
present
sultan
has
done
much
to
elevate
the
system
of
public
instruction
in
his
dominions
he
has
ordained
a
council
to
superintend
all
educational
affairs
and
also
has
commenced
the

medicine
although
the
ancient
arabs
were
celebrated
for
their
medical
knowledge
the
osmanlis
have
only
of
late
years
made
some
advances
in
the
study
of
medicine
they
are
most
credulous
and
superstitious
in
their
notions
upon
this
subject
and
ready
to
follow
the
advice
of
any
empiric
in
the
healing
art
they
seem
to
know
two
diseases
peculiar
to
themselves
one
they
call
gelinjik
and
the
other
yelanjik
the
first
is
used
in
a
comprehensive
universality
and
signifies
almost
any
ailment
the
second
is
applied
to
erysipelas
and
nervous
pains
in
the
face
the
art
of
curing
the
gelinjik
has
long
been
possessed
by
a
single
family
and
descended
in
hereditary
succession
from
one
to
another
of
its
members
there
is
a
certain
meriem
kadun
of
this
profession
who
once
had
the
good
fortune
to
cure
the
present
sultan
with
some
of
the
mysterious
red
nectar
which
is
the
principal
medicine
administered
for
this
malady
she
has
ever
since
had
abundant
practice
in
the
royal
palace
and
everywhere
else
and
the
famous
yelanjikgee
has
a
reputation
a
particular
class
of
emirs
or
the
descendants
of
fatima
the
daughter
of
mohammed
are
supposed
to
possess
the
virtue
of
healing
the
nervous
diseases
of
the
face
called
yelanjik
they
wear
green
turbans
repeat
certain
prayers
over
the
patient
and
are
supposed
to
possess
a
charm
in
their
fingers
ends
the
emir
lays
his
thumb
on
his
nose
breathes
upon
the
extended
fingers
then
lays
it
upon
the
forehead
of
the
patient
and
pressing
upon
the
nerves
of
the
face
utters
a
short
prayer
thus
he
often
succeeds
in
dispelling
the
malady
in
a
few
minutes
whether
by
his
own
medical
skill
or
by
the
credulity
of
his
superstitious
patients
may
be
questioned
strange
to
say
their
only
belief
is
that
when
a
cure
is
not
effected
it
is
not
because
of
the
inefficacy
of
the
charmed
fingers
but
the
disease
was
not
genuine
yelanjik
and
therefore
the
holy
emir
could
not
cure
it
when
any
disease
fails
to
be
cured
by
either
of
these
characters
the
gelinjikgee
and
yelanjikgee
then
in
despair
the
other
disciples
of
the
healing
art
are
summoned
of
whom
there
is
no
scarcity
in
constantinople
where
the
last
comer
is
generally
patronized
until
some
new
pretender
succeeds
him
a
person
once
exceedingly
ill
of
typhus
fever
called
in
one
of
these
medical
gentlemen
who
although
he
considered
the
case
quite
hopeless
prescribed
for
his
patient
and
took
his
leave
the
next
day
in
passing
by

inquired
of
a
servant
at
the
door
if
his
master
was
not
dead

he
is
much

whereupon
the
doctor
proceeded
up

to
obtain
the
solution
of
this
miracle

convalescent
i
was
consumed
with
thirst
and
i
drank

of

in

suffering
from

he
forthwith
prescribed

of

juice
on
calling
the
next
day
to
congratulate
his
patient
on
his

he
was
astonished
to
be
told
the
man

the
oriental
esculapius
in
his
bewilderment
as
to
these
phenomena
came
to
the
safe
conclusion
and
duly
noted
it
in

that
although
in

of

pickled
cabbage
juice
is
an
efficient
remedy
it

not

although
the
manners
and
dress
of
the
orientals
were
and
are
still
in
many
respects
very
different
from
those
of
their
western
neighbors
yet
they
have
displayed
a
degree
of
civilization
if
we
may
so
speak
in
their
toleration
of
others
as
they
chanced
to
meet
them
english
spanish
italians
magiars
greeks
albanians
croats
bulgarians
persians
kurds
and
arabs
walk
their
streets
and
enter
their
houses
without
dreaming
of
changing
their
costume
or
disguising
their
own
nationality
under
any
garb
whatever
even
the
european
or
american
travellers
making
attempts
at
external
conformity
to
those
about
them
although
they
become
perfect
caricatures
have
free
scope
to
sport
the
travesties
they
make
of
themselves
and
are
even
treated
with
civility
yet
judging
from
appearances
no
one
could
conceive
what
parts
of
the
world
might
claim
the
honor
of
their
nativity
indeed
the
only
occasion
upon
which
we
remember
the
turks
to
have
taken
umbrage
at
the
european
costume
was
some
time
ago
when
visitors
desired
to
present
themselves
before
his
imperial
highness
their
ideas
of
decency
compelled
them
to
furnish
each
one
with
a
long
pelisse
so
far
have
they
yielded
their
prejudices
as
even
to
adopt
the
european
military
and
undress
costume
only
excluding
the
hat
though
not
without
a
struggle
as
was
exemplified
when
sultan
mahmoud
ordered
the
janissaries
to
doff
their
cumbersome
flowing
robes
and
ample
trowsers
but
alas
for
the
robes
and
turbans
the
cashmere
girdles
and
yellow
slippers
they
are
rapidly
passing
away
the
of
the
grand
signor
is
now
filled
with
an
ordinary
assemblage
the
sultan
and
his
minister
are
stripped
of
the
mysterious
appendages
of
their
gorgeous
draperies
beneath
which
there
seemed
to
breathe
no
common
soul
how
imposing
the
garb
as
they
were
wont
to
stand
in
the
august
presence
immovable
impenetrable
each
with
his
majesty
of
mien
flowing
beard
and
portentous
silence
we
have
seen
a
of
an
ancient
court
or
as
it
was
scarce
thirty
years
ago
in
the
days
of
the
father
of
the
present
sultan
mahmoud
was
seated
on
his
throne
upon
an
elevated
platform
an
immense
turban
composed
of
innumerable
folds
of
the
purest
and
finest
white
muslin
covered
his
royal
head
in
the
front
of
which
was
placed
a
magnificent
spray
of
brilliants
his
robes
of
rich
silk
were
confined
by
a
girdle
of
cashmere
softest
and
richest
fabrics
while
over
his
shoulders
hung
a
magnificent
pelisse
lined
throughout
with
the
best
of
russia
sables
behind
him
stood
his
numerous
pages
all
young
blooming
and
beardless
as
the
fairest
maidens
arrayed
in
robes
of
delicate
tints
the
silahdar
holding
his
majesty
sword
upright
stood
on
the
right
hand
while
the
haznadar
or
lord
steward
was
upon
the
other
side
of
the
sultan
the
or
chief
of
the
white
eunuchs
was
behind
the
chair
an
old
man
beardless
and
wrinkled
in
the

were
the

cup
bearer

bashi
coffee
server
gentlemen
of
the
wardrobe
etc
below
the
platform
and
in
front
of
the
sultan
stood
in
respective
rank
the
different
ministers
of
the
realm
all
robed
to
the
feet
in
rich
and
varied
hues
and
no
two
turbans
alike
they
seemed
indeed
to
be
the
movers
and
arbitrary
controllers
of
the
destinies
of
a
vast
nation
the
secret
springs
which
kept
the
machine
in
motion
a
most
interesting
collection
of
illustrative
models
from
life
is
carefully
preserved
at
constantinople
called
the
elbisseyi
atiké
and
exhibited
at
the
great
square
of
at
meydan
or
the
ancient
hippodrome
near
sophia
it
is
wonderfully
true
to
nature
and
typical
of
eastern
life
recalling
those
very
characters
with
their
various
avocations
who
but
a
few
years
ago
were
all
upon
the
scene
enacting
the
very
reality
of
orientalism
the
different
grades
of
life
the
officers
under
government
civil
religious
and
military
the
various
trades
and
callings
and
individuals
of
both
sexes
were
formerly
each
and
all
designated
by
a
peculiar
style
and
appearance
the
janissaries
were
also
habited
in
various
costumes
according
to
their
ranks
and
employments
such
was
the
past
magnificence
of
turkey
now
rapidly
losing
its
former
type
of
varied
external
beauty
as
it
merges
from
day
to

rousseau
has
wisely
observed

and
as
the
tone
of
society
in
all
countries
is
derived
from
the
courts
and
the

so
also
in
turkey
the

and
his

are
the
model
of
domestic
life
and
its
institutions
sultan

the

both
younger
than

who
is
married

in

the
sultan
has
until
now
had
nine
children
two
girls
and
seven
boys
but
none
of
his
children
will
succeed
him
while
his

for
the
law
of
the
country
requires
that
the
eldest
living
male
member
of
the
imperial
family
shall
ascend
the
throne
the
ceremony
of
the
coronation
consists
simply
in
escorting
the
new
sultan
in
a
state
procession
to
a
particular
mosque
at
eyoub
at
the
northern
extremity
of
the
city
where
he
girds
on
the
sword
of

after
suitable
prayers
and
is
thus
constituted
padishah
the
princes
regent
of
turkey
were
formerly
shut
up
at
a
place
called
kafes
or
cage
within
the
old
seraglio
where
they
were
watched
and
closely
guarded
and
never
allowed
to
go
abroad
with
a
view
to
avoid
intrigue
or
civil
commotion
but
sultan
mahmoud
first
broke
the
unsocial
chains
of
ancient
usages
his
successor
has
nobly
followed
in
his
father
footsteps
and
allows
his
brother
liberty
to
go
out
when
he
wishes
but
not
without
a
formal
application
for
permission
which
is
enjoined
upon
him
by
court
etiquette
the
two
brothers
differ
very
materially
from
each
other
in
temperament
and
character
the
sultan
is
of
a
mild
and
affable
disposition
and
so
willing
and
yielding
is
he
on
matters
of
state
to
please
his
people
that
he
is
more
ready
to
be
governed
than
to
govern
his
brother
on
the
contrary
is
very
stern
and
passionate
and
has
the
same
determined
character
as
his
father
is
of
medium
stature
rather
delicately
formed
his
eyes
are
dark
and
heavy
in
expression
with
lofty
and
arched
his
beard
and
moustaches
of
a
dark
auburn
hue
are
carefully
trimmed
and
completely
conceal
the
expression
of
his
lower
features
his
complexion
is
very
pallid
and
his
whole
air
decidedly
nonchalant
on
all
state
occasions
he
appears
in
public
on
horseback
wearing
the
national
fess
ornamented
with
the
royal
aigrette
in
brilliants
his
short
spanish
cloak
falls
in
graceful
folds
around
his
person
the
collar
of
which
is
also
adorned
with
diamonds
in
a
word
his
lofty
carriage
and
beautifully
caparisoned
steed
quite
realize
the
picturesque
ideas
generally
conceived
of
an
eastern
monarch
he
never
salutes
any
one
in
public
or
private
save
by
a
single
glance
of
his
eye
his
favorite
residence
is
the
palace
of
tchiraghan
on
the
european
shore
of
the
bosphorus
a
few
miles
from
the
city
in
order
to
accommodate
the
numerous
and
peculiar
retinue
of
an
osmanli
sovereign
there
is
a
similarity
in
the
internal
arrangements
of
all
the
royal
residences
these
palaces
like
all
other
osmanli
houses
are
divided
into
two
compartments
the
first
is
called
the
selamluk
or
the
place
of
salutation
and
is
appropriated
to
the
men
the
second
is
the
harem
which
belongs
exclusively
to
the
ladies
between
these
two
are
the
apartments
of
the
sultan
called
mabeyn
the
personnel
of
a
sultan
formerly
consisted
of
many
functionaries
their
number
has
of
late
been
much
reduced
though
they
are
still
very
numerous
the
principal
honorary
officer
is
the
silahdar
or
imperial
whose
office
being
a
sinecure
he
only
enters
the
presence
when
specially
summoned
or
to
make
some
official
reports
those
who
are
in
the
most
constant
communication
with
the
sultan
are
his
own
private
secretaries
and
the
mabeyngys
or
chamberlains
and
he
is
always
attended
by
one
or
two
of
the
latter
when
he
goes
out
these
gentlemen
having
the
private
ear
of
his
majesty
there
is
constant
intrigue
among
the
different
political
parties
to
ensure
their
patronage
as
the
easiest
means
of
access
to
his
sublime
highness
the
enderoun
aghalery
or
gentlemen
of
the
royal
household
are
young
men
selected
from
among
the
slaves
and
also
from
the
families
of
the
citizens
they
are
trained
from
their
earliest
years
to
the
usages
of
the
palace
and
receive
an
education
suited
to
their
prospective
career
when
they
are
fitted
for
attendance
upon
his
imperial
majesty
they
become
or
pages
of
the
presence
and
perform
the
duties
of
gentlemen
of
the
wardrobe
and
slippers
pipe
and
coffee
bearers
ushers
etc
they
are
many
of
them
distinguished
for
their
elegance
of
manner
and
intelligence
from
the
rank
of
pages
they
are
afterwards
promoted
to
be
chamberlains
and
often
even
attain
the
dignity
of
müshirs
or
ministers
of
state
the
present
ministers
riza
pasha
and
pasha
the
of
the
sultan
were
both
mahmoud
pages
the
mutes
are
as
indispensable
as
any
of
the
palace
attendants
when
the
grand
vezir
goes
alone
or
in
company
with
the
grand
mufty
to
the
imperial
chamber
all
the
mabeyngys
and
the
enderoun
aghalery
withdraw
and
the
deaf
mutes
remain
in
attendance
as
on
no
occasion
not
even
during
a
grand
council
when
they
deliberate
with
closed
doors
the
osmanlis
can
dispense
with
their
attendants
mutes
are
always
very
necessary
appendages
to
them
both
at
the
palace
and
the
porte
although
they
have
not
the
sense
of
hearing
nor
the
faculty
of
speech
they
possess
a
remarkable
quickness
of
comprehension
and
have
a
great
tact
in
communicating
their
ideas
even
to
the
divulging
of
state
secrets
to
their
intimate
friends
and
favorites
they
were
formerly
the
executioners
of
the
palace
no
reason
can
be
assigned
for
their
holding
such
an
office
unless
being
deaf
and
dumb
they
were
not
qualified
to
hear
and
pity
the
unfortunate
victims
there
are
also
generally
one
or
two
dwarfs
in
the
royal
retinue
who
are
a
sort
of
court
jesters
there
is
one
now
at
the
palace
who
became
a
very
distinguished
character
during
the
reign
of
mahmoud
on
one
occasion
when
the
sultan
was
in
high
glee
he
summoned
this
man
of
small
pretensions
to
the
harem
his
majesty
wishing
to
test
his
ingenuity
proposed
to
him
that
if
he
could
kiss
any
one
of
those
girls
pointing
to
a
group
of
tall
and
beautiful
circassian
slaves
in
attendance
he
should
have
that
very
one
for
his
wife
at
this
novel
and
unexpected
intimation
sir
paynim
raised
his
eyes
to
survey
the
bewitching
circle
apparently
so
far
beyond
his
reach
but
such
a
chance
could
not
be
lost
at
all
hazards
he
boldly
advanced
to
one
of
the
fairest
and
while
she
looked
down
upon
him
in
dismay
gave
her
tangible
proofs
of
his
attachment
by
a
tremendous
blow
on
her
stomach
as
she
almost
doubled
with
pain
her
pigmy
lover
seized
her
around
the
neck
imprinted
his
first
kiss
of
love
and
gained
the
royal
prize
by
this
coup
de
main
at
the
threshold
of
the
mabeyn
you
will
meet
the
enderoun
aghalery
or
the
gentlemen
of
the
household
passing
by
these
personages
you
ascend
the
stairway
and
enter
a
large
hall
on
all
sides
are
many
curtained
doorways
at
one
of
which
two
guards
are
stationed
these
are
the
perdegys
or
curtain
keepers
to
his
majesty
the
peculiarity
of
their
domestic
habits
the
ladies
occupying
separate
apartments
leaves
the
entire
selamluk
free
and
accessible
to
all
hence
the
necessity
when
wishing
to
be
retired
of
having
curtains
suspended
to
the
doorways
and
guards
stationed
to
prevent
the
abrupt
encroachment
of
visitors
and
strangers
the
personal
vanity
of
the
osmanlis
is
such
that
no
occasion
is
neglected
for
its
gratification
and
munificence
is
always
the
concomitant
of
rank
and
distinction
therefore
the
slightest
service
is
invariably
compensated
by
a
remuneration
technically
called
bakshish
the
keahya
at
the
landing
who
holds
your
cayik
while
you
disembark
or
the
ostler
who
holds
your
horse
the
pabouchjy
who
officiously
arranges
your
slippers
as
you
leave
the
house
with
the
whole
household
retinue
of
obsequious
attendants
one
and
all
expect
the
customary
bakshish
so
universal
is
this
practice
that
the
grander
the
establishment
the
lower
are
the
wages
of
the
servants
who
are
sure
to
reap
so
good
a
harvest
from
the
numerous
visitors
that
they
willingly
compound
for
the
most
trifling
salaries
indeed
it
may
justly
be
said
that
the
grandees
support
each
other
menials
this
system
pervades
all
classes
of
the
people
and
even
the
palace
of
the
sultan
an
amusing
story
is
told
illustrative
of
the
way
in
which
these
perdegys
make
their
post
available
one
of
these
guards
seemed
to
be
enjoying
such
extensive
revenues
from
his
office
that
he
was
reported
to
his
majesty
in
a
very
ludicrous
manner
a
certain
wit
by
name
a
sort
of
an
oriental
curran
occasionally
used
to
visit
the
sultan
but
never
without
paying
tribute
to
these
keepers
of
the
curtain
nettled
at
these
exactions
and
wishing
to
attract
his
attention
to
the
subject
he
one
day
entered
the
royal
presence
with
a
large
mackerel
the
commonest
fish
in
turkey
in
his
hand
as
a
present
the
sultan
was
struck
with
the
oddity
of
the
gift
and
supposing
that
the
expectations
of
the
donor
could
only
be
realized
by
some
royal
munificence
asked
what
he
desired
in
return
only
lashes
sire
was
the
prompt
reply
this
reply
added
to
his
majesty
astonishment
and
why
so
strange
a
request
he
demanded
because
since
i
am
obliged
to
share
all
your
majesty
gifts
with
your
majesty
curtain
keepers
i
wish
the
rogues
to
have
their
share
in
this
also
judging
from
your
benevolent
countenance
that
you
are
endowed
with
generous
impulses
the
keepers
allow
you
to
pass
within
the
curtained
door
you
are
now
in
a
large
apartment
on
three
sides
of
which
are
windows
with
a
wide
turkish
sofa
at
the
end
some
two
feet
high
from
the
floor
where
the
sultan
is
seated
entirely
alone
with
a
desk
and
implements
of
writing
before
him
and
a
long
and
graceful
chibouk
mounted
with
a
splendid
amber
ornamented
with
diamonds
carelessly
lying
by
his
ride
he
utters
the
simple
word
gel
come
when
several
attendants
appear
as
if
by
magic
and
stand
before
him
with
folded
hands
at
every
command
they
make
the
temennah
or
turkish
salutation
which
is
done
not
by
bending
the
person
and
bringing
their
arms
over
their
heads
as
though
they
were
going
to
dive
as
is
often
represented
in
theatres
but
simply
by
raising
the
right
hand
to
the
mouth
the
fingers
touching
the
lips
then
the
right
temple
and
then
carelessly
dropping
it
down
this
temennah
is
performed
without
uttering
a
single
word
and
signifies
perfect
comprehension
of
the
royal
orders
an
air
of
humility
is
always
maintained
in
the
presence
of
superiors
and
such
signs
of
active
existence
as
coughing
or
sneezing
are
quite
unallowable
the
person
feeling
preliminary
symptoms
of
these
actions
being
obliged
either
to
suppress
them
or
to
withdraw
from
the
presence
indeed
the
social
etiquettes
are
very
strict
even
among
equals
although
tobacco
is
introduced
on
occasions
of
ceremony
and
social
intercourse
the
chibouk
and
nargillé
are
not
the
calumets
of
peace
but
of
hospitality
the
disagreeable
concomitants
of
the
weed
so
universal
in
america
are
absolutely
unknown
in
turkey
spitting
then
is
to
the
osmanlis
a
most
repulsive
act
and
their
horror
may
be
imagined
when
on
a
certain
occasion
while
in
the
company
of
a
grandee
of
the
realm
the
representative
of
the
great
american
nation
the
new
world
deliberately
took
his
quid
from
his
pocket
and
after
cutting
the
requisite
morsel
stored
it
carefully
in
the
corner
of
his
mouth
and
commenced
the
slow
mastication
so
characteristic
of
good
tobacco
chewers
the
indulgence
of
such
a
luxury
having
only
made
his
excellency
mouth
water
and
there
being
no
other
accommodation
at
hand
in
order
to
relieve
his
salivary
glands
he
was
obliged
to
aim
at
an
open
window
close
by
his
excellency
consequently
became
a
sort
of
a
proverb
among
them
and
the
question
was
repeatedly
asked
does
your
american
friend
still
continue
to
enact
the
camel
or
does
he
not
weary
of
chewing
the
cud
unlearned
in
classic
lore
how
should
they
know
that
the
poet
once
said
tu
tantum
erucis
imprime
dentem
no
one
is
ever
seated
in
the
presence
of
the
sultan
nor
are
any
of
the
customary
rites
of
hospitality
observed
such
as
the
introduction
of
pipes
coffee
sherbet
etc
on
the
presentation
of
foreign
ambassadors
the
ceremony
is
so
arranged
that
the
minister
plenipotentiary
and
his
sublime
highness
enter
the
apartment
simultaneously
by
opposite
doors
thus
the
sultan
receives
the
representatives
of
foreign
potentates
on
foot
without
condescending
to
rise
from
his
seat
after
the
audience
is
terminated
the
royal
guests
are
conducted
into
the
apartment
of
the
mabeyngys
where
they
are
treated
with
true
oriental
hospitality
and
munificence
those
persons
who
are
not
aware
of
the
wonderful
changes
that
have
taken
place
in
turkey
may
fancy
this
monarch
to
be
surrounded
by
a
group
of
robed
turbaned
and
bearded
osmanlis
on
the
contrary
both
the
sultan
and
his
attendants
now
wear
a
european
military
frock
coat
and
pantaloons
with
only
the
national
fess
for
a
the
moustache
is
universally
worn
and
it
would
seem
as
ridiculous
to
an
osmanli
to
shave
the
eyebrows
as
the
indeed
nothing
excites
the
curiosity
of
the
rising
generation
so
much
as
to
see
a
man
without
a
moustache
especially
an
aged
man
in
whose
case
it
would
seem
to
them
like
an
attempt
at
perpetual
youth
there
is
not
a
beard
to
be
seen
on
any
of
the
attendants
of
the
palace
for
the
beard
is
considered
in
turkey
as
a
mark
of
dignity
and
freedom
consequently
no
one
in
the
personal
service
of
the
sultan
is
allowed
this
honor
except
by
special
permission
of
his
majesty
which
implies
that
the
individual
is
no
longer
retained
in
the
palace
but
soon
to
be
elevated
to
some
superior
office
the
beard
then
being
indicative
of
rank
and
position
it
is
preserved
with
a
certain
superstitious
reverence
no
mussulman
therefore
after
the
ceremony
of
allowing
the
beard
to
grow
has
been
once
performed
ever
again
uses
the
razor
nevertheless
it
is
not
permitted
to
assume
the
natural
growth
but
is
carefully
trimmed
according
to
the
fashion
of
modern
times
makes
his
appearance
in
the
mabeyn
early
in
the
morning
for
it
is
a
universal
custom
with
the
osmanlis
to
rise
early
he
generally
spends
his
mornings
in
the
perusal
of
local
and
foreign
newspapers
which
are
translated
for
him
and
other
general
reading
he
has
lately
acquired
a
taste
for
the
french
language
in
which
he
has
made
considerable
progress
he
is
according
to
the
turkish
acceptance
of
the
term
that
is
well
versed
in
turkish
with
a
general
acquaintance
with
the
history
of
his
own
country
the
science
of
mathematics
has
also
engrossed
some
of
his
attention
and
he
even
condescended
to
receive
instructions
from
etem
pasha
a
young
man
of
distinguished
abilities
and
foreign
education
who
was
taken
into
the
royal
retinue
as
colonel
of
the
doubtless
however
with
reference
to
his
scientific
acquirements
his
majesty
meals
according
to
the
custom
of
the
country
are
two
one
in
the
morning
between
ten
and
eleven
the
other
at
sunset
they
are
served
by
the
tcheshnigear
whose
duty
it
is
to
break
the
seals
of
the
different
dishes
intended
for
the
sultan
repast
and
after
having
tasted
to
carry
them
into
the
royal
presence
although
the
osmanlis
are
great
epicures
their
tastes
are
very
singular
their
dishes
are
very
diversified
and
numerous
consisting
usually
of
twelve
or
fifteen
and
sometimes
even
thirty
courses
sweet
and
meat
dishes
being
introduced
in
alternate
succession
the
meal
commencing
with
soup
and
ending
with
pilaf
or
a
preparation
of
rice
peculiar
to
turkey
they
have
a
species
of
pastry
or
paklava
which
is
remarkably
light
and
delicious
and
the
mohalleby
or
turkish
is
much
liked
even
by
europeans
fruit
at
constantinople
is
very
abundant
and
delicious
and
is
partaken
of
frequently
during
a
repast
indeed
the
grapes
of
scutari
called
tchavoush
are
unrivalled
and
even
more
delicious
and
delicate
than
those
of
madeira
or
malaga
the
order
in
which
a
dinner
is
served
is
as
follows
soup
kebab
or
roast
meat
in
small
pieces
entremet
or
vegetables
and
meat
cooked
together
pastry
roast
fish
entremet
mohalleby
entremet
maccaroni
fowls
jelly
until
at
last
it
winds
up
with
the
significative
pilaf
and
sherbet
or
no
wine
or
liquor
is
served
at
the
table
but
his
sublimity
occasionally
during
the
day
visits
the
pantry
doubtless
for
his
stomach
sake
and
his
often
infirmities
unfortunately
modern
civilization
has
some
vices
as
well
as
many
virtues
and
the
fashion
of
excessive
drinking
has
among
others
lately
crept
into
turkey
to
which
some
of
the
élégants
are
becoming
much
addicted
and
ere
long
they
may
perhaps
excel
even
the
paragon
john
bull
although
many
other
innovations
and
attempts
at
reform
have
succeeded
in
turkey
yet
the
original
style
of
eating
has
not
been
much
improved
they
use
neither
chairs
nor
tables
but
a
low
stool
being
put
in
the
middle
of
the
room
a
large
circular
copper
tray
is
placed
upon
it
no
such
paraphernalia
as
cloths
napkins
knives
forks
plates
glasses
are
essential
small
loaves
of
bread
alternately
with
small
dishes
of
fruit
pickles
anchovies
cheese
are
indiscriminately
scattered
around
the
edges
of
the
tray
in
the
middle
of
which
the
different
preparations
of
food
are
successively
placed
by
the
ayvaz
or
scullion
and
the
food
is
eaten
with
the
fingers
excepting
the
liquid
dishes
for
which
wooden
spoons
are
provided
around
the
tray
the
company
assemble
sitting
with
their
legs
under
them
and
all
eating
from
the
dish
in
the
middle
reminding
us
of
the
customs
of
ancient
times
when
it
was
said
it
is
one
of
the
twelve
who
dippeth
with
me
in
the
dish
one
long
narrow
napkin
is
provided
which
goes
all
round
the
tray
and
lies
upon
the
floor
each
person
slipping
under
it
as
he
sits
down
their
tables
being
accessible
to
their
friends
at
all
times
are
never
given
except
on
state
occasions
for
hospitality
being
one
of
the
characteristics
of
the
east
and
especially
enjoined
by
the
koran
no
one
is
excluded
from
their
board
and
when
the
number
present
is
so
large
as
not
to
allow
them
to
sit
comfortably
they
place
themselves
or
in
a
sort
of
spoon
fashion
as
though
they
were
leaning
upon
one
another
and
thus
illustrating
the
scene
at
the
feast
of
the
passover
in
some
of
the
houses
of
the
wealthy
and
especially
of
those
whose
owners
have
visited
europe
the
european
mode
of
eating
is
imitated
when
the
motley
company
which
is
always
assembled
sometimes
presents
a
most
ludicrous
scene
once
a
turk
at
such
a
table
wishing
to
conform
to
the
customs
of
civilized
life
endeavored
to
use
the
fork
failing
in
several
attempts
to
take
a
piece
of
meat
and
determined
to
overcome
his
gaucherie
he
resolutely
took
hold
of
the
morsel
with
his
fingers
and
placing
one
end
of
the
fork
against
his
breast
stuck
the
meat
upon
it
with
an
immense
effort
and
then
carried
it
to
his
mouth
quite
contented
with
his
own
success
amid
the
applause
of
the
company
during
the
sacred
month
of
ramazan
however
the
european
mode
of
eating
is
never
practised
even
by
the
most
enlightened
and
liberal
knives
forks
tables
and
chairs
are
then
altogether
set
aside
as
being
too
profane
his
majesty
usually
breakfasts
at
the
mabeyn
and
always
quite
alone
for
no
one
being
equal
to
him
none
can
have
the
honor
of
his
company
and
his
evening
repast
is
often
taken
weather
permitting
at
some
beautiful
the
time
between
these
two
meals
is
usually
occupied
with
some
of
his
ministers
or
the
audiences
of
the
foreign
ambassadors
and
in
excursions
on
the
bosphorus
or
elsewhere
whatever
transpires
at
the
porte
is
reported
to
him
every
evening
through
the
ameddjy
or
state
chancellor
expressed
in
the
most
beautiful
and
elegant
style
of
which
the
turkish
language
is
capable
in
fact
the
bureau
of
the
ameddjy
is
considered
the
best
school
for
polite
literature
and
those
who
have
once
served
in
that
department
invariably
acquire
a
remarkable
elegance
of
diction
the
sultan
reads
over
these
documents
every
evening
together
with
the
or
petitions
which
are
presented
to
him
on
fridays
and
after
giving
his
imperial
sanction
or
veto
returns
them
to
the
porte
to
be
acted
upon
accordingly
the
approval
of
the
sultan
is
not
expressed
by
the
application
of
any
royal
seal
or
cypher
but
by
a
bold
stroke
of
his
majesty
reed
representing
the
arabic
letter
s
which
is
termed
sah
meaning
correct
or
approved
and
those
which
are
rejected
are
torn
in
one
corner
the
sultan
cipher
called
toora
is
formed
from
the
names
of
the
reigning
monarch
and
that
of
his
father
it
reads
thus
sultan
son
of
sultan
malmoud
khan
the
sultan
of
sultans
this
is
the
imperial
seal
and
ottoman
coat
of
arms
and
it
is
affixed
to
all
royal
edicts
engraved
upon
public
buildings
and
stamped
upon
the
various
current
coins
of
the
empire
when
his
evening
occupations
are
over
the
sultan
retires
to
the
harem
such
is
the
ordinary
routine
of
the
life
of
the
turkish
sovereign
but
there
are
also
many
other
public
duties
which
occupy
his
time
and
attention
and
fully
demonstrate
that
the
post
of
sultan
is
by
no
means
a
sinecure
chapter
xx
public
duties
of
the
sultan
the
sultan
is
obliged
to
attend
one
of
the
public
mosques
in
person
every
friday
which
is
the
mohammedan
sunday
one
reason
of
his
public
appearance
is
to
set
an
example
of
religious
devotion
another
to
assure
the
people
by
his
actual
presence
that
he
is
in
the
enjoyment
of
life
and
health
and
a
third
to
give
an
opportunity
to
any
of
his
discontented
subjects
to
appeal
to
him
in
person
for
the
right
of
appeal
has
never
been
denied
in
turkey
this
is
done
by
a
paper
which
is
held
in
the
extended
hand
of
the
petitioner
and
presented
anywhere
in
the
course
of
the
royal
route
it
is
received
by
his
pages
and
reserved
for
the
future
perusal
of
his
majesty
his
departure
both
from
the
palace
and
the
mosque
is
announced
by
a
royal
salute
of
guns
from
the
batteries
and
the
ships
of
war
these
opportunities
are
eagerly
embraced
by
all
strangers
who
wish
to
gaze
on
the
great
tamer
of
infidels
and
the
scourger
of
the
unbelieving
race
of
christian
vassals
there
are
two
other
great
state
festivals
on
which
occasions
the
sultan
and
the
whole
of
the
royal
retinue
combine
to
present
one
of
the
most
beautiful
oriental
pageants
these
are
the
feasts
of
bairam
one
of
which
occurs
at
the
end
of
ramazan
or
the
long
fast
and
the
other
the
courban
bairam
or
feast
of
the
sacrifice
days
after
there
is
a
grand
state
procession
surrounded
by
his
numerous
pages
in
uniforms
glittering
with
golden
embroidery
and
plumed
attended
by
dignitaries
of
the
realm
in
full
court
dress
all
mounted
on
arabian
steeds
splendidly
caparisoned
the
sultan
enters
the
mosque
of
sultan
ahmed
at
the
ancient
hippodrome
he
alights
upon
a
velvet
carpeting
which
extends
into
the
mosque
and
is
supported
on
each
side
by
chamberlains
as
he
dismounts
the
voice
of
the
assembled
multitude
proclaims
allah
padishahumuza
oozoon
eömürler
versin
long
live
the
king
god
bless
the
sultan
the
padishah
after
the
performance
of
prayers
returns
to
his
palace
at
the
seraglio
point
where
the
throne
room
is
always
preserved
there
he
receives
the
compliments
of
the
season
from
his
ministers
and
officers
of
state
the
procession
to
the
mosque
being
public
has
been
described
by
many
who
have
witnessed
it
but
from
the
reception
at
the
palace
all
foreigners
are
excluded
the
sultan
is
seated
on
a
chair
of
state
with
the
princes
and
younger
princesses
of
the
royal
blood
on
each
side
behind
the
throne
in
a
semicircle
stand
the
personnel
of
the
royal
household
opposite
the
throne
at
the
farthest
end
of
the
hall
a
band
of
musicians
is
stationed
and
as
they
perform
the
national
airs
the
dignitaries
enter
the
royal
presence
according
to
their
respective
ranks
to
pay
homage
to
their
sovereign
as
has
already
been
described
the
usual
mode
of
salutation
in
the
east
is
the
temennah
made
by
touching
the
hand
to
the
lips
and
then
to
the
forehead
which
signifies
affection
and
humility
with
the
desire
however
to
be
more
respectful
they
often
bend
down
to
the
ground
as
if
willing
to
take
up
the
very
dust
upon
which
the
honored
feet
have
rested
or
attempt
to
kiss
the
hem
of
the
garment
but
all
these
ordinary
modes
of
salutation
are
insufficient
at
a
royal
reception
when
a
beautifully
embroidered
rug
is
spread
before
the
sultan
on
one
end
of
which
his
feet
rest
as
they
present
themselves
they
slowly
bend
their
persons
and
touch
their
lips
and
foreheads
to
the
border
of
the
carpet
which
ceremony
is
called
the
kissing
of
the
sultan
feet
for
no
one
is
allowed
any
actual
proximity
to
the
royal
person
thus
guarding
him
from
the
assassin
dagger
after
kissing
the
end
of
the
carpet
they
arrange
themselves
in
two
opposite
lines
on
each
side
of
the
sultan
to
witness
the
homages
of
the
various
pashas
and
other
dignitaries
those
who
take
their
stand
in
the
presence
are
only
the
heads
of
the
departments
both
civil
and
religious
after
the
ceremony
is
over
every
one
retires
to
hit
own
dwelling
to
enact
the
sultan
to
his
subordinates
the
courban
bairam
is
the
great
festival
celebrated
by
the
pilgrims
at
mecca
in
commemoration
of
the
offering
up
of
ishmael
and
is
generally
observed
throughout
the
mohammedan
dominions
on
which
occasion
every
mussulman
must
kill
a
sheep
with
his
own
hand
and
distribute
the
meat
to
the
poor
the
sultan
performs
this
sacrifice
at
his
own
palace
before
the
morning
prayers
as
he
stands
at
the
threshold
a
ram
with
gilded
horns
is
laid
at
his
feet
and
girding
himself
with
a
silken
towel
he
completes
the
sacrifice
the
solution
of
this
act
of
devotion
is
that
they
believe
that
the
faithful
will
be
transported
over
the
surat
or
bridge
of
hair
into
paradise
on
the
backs
of
these
immolated
victims
the
old
seraglio
which
was
the
residence
of
so
many
sultans
and
the
scene
of
the
aggrandizement
and
downfall
of
so
many
good
mussulmans
under
whose
latticed
windows
the
bosphorus
flows
so
deeply
as
to
tell
no
tales
of
the
hundreds
of
living
and
beautiful
maidens
that
have
perished
in
the
blue
waves
and
left
no
sign
of
their
sad
fate
the
bloody
and
mysterious
seraglio
is
now
deserted
save
on
such
occasions
as
have
been
described
notwithstanding
assertions
to
the
contrary
how
many
of
the
royal
blood
even
sultans
themselves
within
this
palace
have
either
drained
the
insidious
and
poisoned
potion
or
been
dispensed
with
by
the
surer
cord
or
assassin
dagger
the
last
victim
was
sultan
mustafa
or
the
uncle
of
the
present
monarch
and
mahmoud
himself
was
miraculously
preserved
by
the
attachment
and
perseverance
of
his
lala

is

if

the

then

you
reduce

a

of

it
may
be
from
the
warmth
of
the
oriental
imagination
and
its
own
extravagant
creations
or
from
the
seclusiveness
of
the
women
who
as
they
became
unfamiliar
objects
seemed
to
be
the
very
venuses

the

indeed
there

even
more

divested
of

extravagance
of

the
very
lack
of

which
in

respects
is
certainly
to
be
lamented

soon
there
will
not

even
the

indeed
a
general
acquaintance

only
serves
to
convince
the
cosmogonist
that
all
are
of
one

a
common
nature
or
origin
are
but
human
and
liable
to
human
frailties
and
passions

most
powerful
emotions
are
felt
in

polite

a
like

wherever

but
how
interesting
to
mark
the
influence
of
circumstances
to
define
the
latitudes

to
measure
the

the

in

word
to
observe
the
same
faculties
under
such
varied
culture
in
comparing
the
different
grades
of
education
and
civilization
it
is
curious
to
observe
how
often
an
innate
refinement
of
feeling
equals
if
not
supersedes
the
greatest
efforts
of
cultivation
or
the
brightest
results
of
philosophy
a
lifetime
spent
in
the
schools
often
leaves
the
man
far
behind
one
whose
early
years
have
passed
in
shrewd
observation
and
practical
experience
for
while
the
one
is
reasoning
abstracting
ruminating
the
other
experiments
and
lo
he
enters
the
very
penetralia
of
the
temple
of
wisdom
and
where
do
we
find
the
most
susceptible
hearts
the
most
poetical
fancies
the
purest
aspirations
of
nature
not
among
the
dry
and
tutored
reasoners
of

where

been

chapter
xxii
the
harem
we
can
not
deny
that
habit
is
second
nature
the
axiom
holds
good
in
every
form
of
social
existence
yet
there
is
a
universal
disposition
to
mutual
criticism
and
condemnation
whether
between
nations
or
neighbors
there
is
always
the
vibrating
why
and
wherefore
and
each
approves
his
own
course
of
action
without
ceding
to
others
the
same
privilege
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
peculiar
style
of
the
toilet
of
the
turkish
ladies
would
be
deprecated
by
the
belles
of
modern
christendom
indeed
we
have
often
heard
these
fastidious
dames
exclaim
in
regarding
representations
of
their
eastern
rivals
most
horribly
indecent
while
they
turned
their
sensitive
vision
from
the
offenders
against
all
delicacy
and
on
the
other
hand
we
have
heard
the
osmanli
hanums
and
efendis
express
equal
honor
at
the
sight
of
a
european
lady
en
costume
de
bal
when
the
marchioness
of
londonderry
presented
herself
at
the
palace
of
the
sultan
en
grand
tenue
for
a
reception
the
gentlemen
in
waiting
could
scarcely
persuade
themselves
to
conduct
her
ladyship
into
the
royal
presence
so
astonished
were
they
at
the
display
of
the
fair
neck
shoulders
etc
both
the
western
and
eastern
toilets
may
be
styled
décolletées
the
one
a
horizontal
the
other
a
longitudinal
display
of
charms
but
one
thing
may
be
said
in
favor
of
the
orientals
that
they
never
appear
in
public
without
covering
their
necks
and
bosoms
and
even
veiling
their
features
they
are
only
permitted
to
appear
uncovered
at
home
and
even
then
only
in
the
presence
of
their
nearest
relatives
on
the
contrary
on
the
most
public
occasions
at
the
operas
balls
soirées
and
many
other
grand
assemblies
do
the
western
décolletées
delight
to
vie
with
each
other
in
their
various
styles
of
full
dress
they
are
even
so
fastidious
as
to
have
no
nomenclature
but
ankles
while
they
willingly
pay
their
dollars
to
see
a
full
extension
of
these
same
ankles
on
the
stage
the
turkish
ladies
with
perfect
indifference
present
their
unslippered
and
even
unhosed
feet
to
any
at
the
same
time
carefully
concealing
their
shalvar
or
full
trowsers
which
are
fastened
below
the
knee
and
tucked
up
whenever
they
sally
forth
for
a
promenade
à
pied
ou
en
voiture
as
to
the
intrinsic
merit
or
real
modesty
of
these
different
styles
peculiar
tastes
and
prevailing
modes
can
only
decide
for
habit
is
strong
in
its
sway
and
imitation
is
a
kindred
principle
therefore
there
is
neither
vice
nor
virtue
in
walking
in
the
footsteps
of
our
predecessors
or
each
man
or
woman
adopting
the
peculiar
modes
and
customs
of
their
own
people
as
fertile
a
brain
may
throb
beneath
a
turban
as
a
hat
as
pure
a
form
enshroud
itself
in
a
modest
veil
as
lurks
beneath
the
shadow
of
a
parisian
bonnet
what
are
externals
but
whims
and
caprices
it
is
the
virtue
of
domestic
institutions
and
daily
habitudes
that
stamps
the
character
of
a
people
european
or
american
ladies
may
grace
their
boudoirs
models
of
beauty
and
excellence
and
turkish
hanums
may
by
the
exercise
of
domestic
virtues
equally
adorn
and
ennoble
the
precincts
of
their
harems
the
word
harem
is
familiar
to
most
persons
but
how
grossly
misunderstood
some
have
considered
it
as
unmentionable
to
ears
polite
while
the
votaries
of
pleasure
ever
ready
to
indulge
their
longing
fancies
have
pictured
it
to
themselves
as
the
earthly
realization
of
the
paradise
of
mohammed
indeed
many
european
authors
in
describing
the
licentious
and
corrupted
courts
of
their
own
monarchs
have
seemed
to
consider
this
term
as
the
most
distinguishing
compendium
of
immorality
strange
perversion
that
the
very
word
which
inspires
every
oriental
whether
mohammedan
or
christian
with
the
greatest
respect
should
suggest
to
the
mind
of
a
european
only
a
system
of
concubinage
and
licentiousness
what
then
is
harem
one
peculiarity
in
the
construction
of
society
in
its
primitive
condition
was
that
might
makes
right
this
not
only
affected
personal
property
but
even
the
more
domestic
relations
if
an
enemy
strong
enough
felt
the
inclination
he
might
rob
his
neighbor
of
his
wife
or
family
of
which
there
are
instances
on
biblical
record
to
avoid
any
occasions
of
such
unjust
appropriation
it
became
a
policy
to
seclude
the
women
from
general
observation
the
unbounded
hospitality
of
those
good
old
days
when
the
worthy
patriarchs
lived
with
open
doors
and
good
cheer
when
the
three
virtues
which
made
a
man
distinguished
were
bravery
eloquence
and
hospitality
or
in
the
hyperbole
of
the
times
a
sharp
sword
a
sweet
tongue
and
forty
tables
in
such
an
era
of
benevolence
it
became
necessary
to
separate
the
more
precious
and
defenseless
portion
of
the
family
from
the
vulgar
gaze
the
seclusion
of
women
then
has
ever
been
one
of
the
greatest
social
peculiarities
of
the
east
and
does
not
date
its
origin
from
modern
times
nor
even
from
the
foundation
of
the
moslem
faith
in
some
forms
it
existed
in
the
times
of
the
ancient
jews
for
when
rebecca
lifted
up
her
eyes
and
saw
isaac
who
had
gone
out
to
meditate
in
the
field
at
even
tide
she
said
unto
the
servant
what
man
is
this
who
walketh
in
the
field
to
meet
us
and
the
servant
said
it
is
my
master
therefore
she
took
a
veil
and
covered
herself
the
mother
of
sisera
looked
out
at
a
window
and
cried
through
the
lattice
the
same
institution
existed
among
the
arabs
from
time
immemorial
so
that
mohammed
was
not
the
originator
of
this
separation
of
women
from
general
society
but
rather
the
sustainer
of
an
old
and
established
usage
which
the
condition
of
the
community
in
his
times
rendered
imperative
speak
unto
the
true
believers
that
they
restrain
their
eyes
and
keep
themselves
from
immodest
actions
this
will
be
more
pure
for
them
for
god
is
well
acquainted
with
that
which
they
do
and
speak
unto
the
believing
women
that
they
restrain
their
eyes
and
preserve
their
modesty
and
discover
not
their
ornaments
personal
charms
except
what
necessarily
appeareth
thereof
and
let
them
throw
their
veils
over
their
bosoms
and
not
show
their
ornaments
unless
to
their
husbands
or
their
fathers
or
their
husband
fathers
or
their
sons
or
their
husband
sons
or
their
brother
sons
or
unto
such
as
attend
them
and
have
no
need
of
women
or
unto
children
who
distinguish
not
the
nakedness
of
men
supposing
then
society
were
on
a
different
basis
according
to
these
tenets
the
women
would
be
perpetually
veiled
and
the
men
ever
wandering
with
averted
eyes
in
order
to
remedy
these
evils
and
facilitate
their
seclusion
the
houses
are
all
divided
into
two
sets
of
apartments
the
selamluk
or
men
apartment
and
the
harem
or
the
sanctuary
of
the
women
where
no
men
are
allowed
to
enter
except
those
specified
by
the
prophet
now
it
is
evident
that
the
principle
upon
which
society
is
constructed
in
the
east
is
the
careful
seclusion
of
women
from
the
gaze
of
the
world
the
peculiar
charm
of
modesty
is
known
and
acknowledged
all
over
the
world
as
the
domestic
arrangements
of
civilized
society
everywhere
demonstrate
the
greeks
of
homer
day
had
their
gynaikeion
the
romans
in
imitation
their
gynæceum
and
modern
civilization
has
created
its
boudoir
but
none
of
these
terms
are
as
expressive
of
the
sanctity
of
the
abode
as
the
word
harem
of
the
orientals
it
is
well
known
that
the
cities
of
mecca
and
medina
are
the
holy
shrines
of
the
mohammedan
faith
no
other
appellative
is
used
in
speaking
of
them
but
the
same
word
harem
which
when
used
in
the
plural
in
itself
comprises
these
venerated
cities
they
say
or
pilgrim
of
the
two
harems
meaning
the
holy
mecca
and
medina
this
word
is
applied
to
the
temple
itself
at
mecca
which
is
honored
by
the
title
of
the
sacred
or
inviolable
temple
thus
some
idea
may
be
formed
of
the
etymology
of
the
term
and
its
sacred
signification
when
used
by
the
arabs
and
other
orientals
to
designate
their
firesides
or
family
homes
the
sanctity
of
which
not
only
admits
of
no
intrusion
but
any
summons
or
interruption
to
the
master
of
the
family
after
he
has
once
retired
is
considered
indecorous
mohammed
received
a
revelation
regarding
himself
while
he
was
engaged
in
his
harem
preparing
the
koran
some
persons
had
the
rudeness
to
call
him
out
in
order
to
reprove
them
and
like
sinners
in
all
times
to
come
the
following
passage
was
revealed
the
interior
of
thy
dwelling
is
a
sanctuary
they
who
violate
it
by
calling
unto
thee
are
deficient
in
the
respect
which
they
owe
to
the
interpreter
of
heaven
this
passage
has
not
only
rendered
the
interior
of
the
dwelling
viz
the
harem
an
inviolable
asylum
to
the
female
portion
of
the
family
but
it
has
made
it
a
convenient
place
of
refuge
to
pashas
and
efendis
where
they
often
seek
repose
from
the
multitude
of
unwelcome
visitors
who
infest
with
perfect
freedom
and
at
all
hours
their
selamluks
the
frequent
visits
of
the
osmanlis
to
their
harems
are
not
always
indications
of
the
attractions
within
but
other
external
motives
may
impel
them
thither
nevertheless
the
inviolability
of
these
precincts
has
induced
the
supposition
that
they
contained
naught
but
the
shrine
of
the
fair
goddess
of
beauty
and
her
sly
coadjutor
the
upper
part
of
a
house
in
america
or
those
rooms
appropriated
to
the
exclusive
use
of
the
ladies
are
as
sacred
and
inviolable
as
any
oriental
harem
and
are
not
as
a
matter
of
course
supposed
to
be
the
scenes
of
mystery
and
intrigue
indeed
it
is
fully
evident
that
the
same
spirit
of
deference
to
the
comfort
of
the
fair
sex
exists
in
america
where
is
seen
over
one
of
the
principal
entrances
to
the
general
the
announcement
exclusively
for
ladies
which
in
turkey
would
be
intimated
by
the
single
and
expressive
word
harem
again
the
ladies
cabin
on
board
the
steamers
would
in
the
east
be
designated
by
the
word
harem
written
in
golden
characters
which
would
at
once
indicate
its
sacred
nature
and
inspire
every
oriental
with
the
respect
due
to
the
sex
which
is
even
more
imperative
in
that
clime
than
in
other
lands
where
they
make
a
glory
and
boast
of
their
excessive
deference
to
the
fairer
portion
of
the
community
hence
how
erroneous
the
impression
that
the
harem
is
a
species
of
female
prison
established
by
the
tyranny
of
men
where
the
weaker
sex
are
forcibly
shut
up
against
their
will
if
the
osmanli
ladies
were
under
no
other
restrictions
their
own
sense
of
based
upon
usage
and
inculcated
by
the
precepts
of
their
religion
would
compel
them
to
the
same
seclusion
i
one
day
happened
to
be
in
the
dressing
room
of
a
pasha
adjoining
the
harem
when
he
left
the
room
for
a
moment
in
the
interval
his
daughter
supposing
her
father
quite
alone
suddenly
entered
the
apartment
but
on
seeing
me
there
instinctively
covering
her
face
with
the
drapery
of
her
sleeve
as
suddenly
disappeared
while
i
myself
as
instinctively
displayed
my
sense
of
the
courtesy
due
to
a
lady
by
looking
as
far
as
i
could
in
an
opposite
direction
i
heard
her
remarking
to
the
slaves
in
the
next
room
that
she
was
so
mortified
for
instead
of
seeing
her
father
there
stood
as
large
as
life
her
feeling
at
being
seen
without
the
precincts
of
the
harem
unveiled
was
the
same
as
would
be
experienced
by
a
lady
of
this
country
who
should
be
surprised
by
the
sight
of
a
gentleman
when
she
was
en
toilette
de
nuit
nor
is
this
seclusion
entirely
mohammedan
but
being
an
ancient
custom
of
the
east
it
is
practised
by
all
who
dwell
in
that
clime
the
families
of
the
rayas
or
subjects
of
the
porte
consisting
of
the
armenians
greeks
and
jews
are
also
under
the
same
social
laws
as
their
mohammedan
compatriots
it
is
true
that
in
proportion
as
european
customs
have
found
their
way
into
these
countries
the
rigidity
of
the
christians
has
relaxed
in
this
respect
because
the
observance
in
question
has
never
been
incorporated
with
their
religion
whereas
mohammed
on
the
contrary
took
special
pains
to
enforce
the
practice
upon
his
followers
the
word
harem
being
by
courtesy
applied
also
to
its
inmates
has
now
become
a
general
term
to
designate
the
female
portion
of
the
family
and
is
by
no
means
synonymous
with
polygamy
otherwise
the
same
expression
would
not
be
used
by
the
christian
subjects
in
speaking
of
their
domestic
relations
it
would
be
said
that
a
certain
pasha
or
an
armenian
banker
had
gone
to
a
distant
place
without
his
harem
or
family
an
osmanli
lady
on
being
informed
of
the
arrival
of
an
american
minister
in
constantinople
would
naturally
inquire
whether
he
was
accompanied
by
his
harem

condition
of

it
is
fortunate
that
the
less
enlightened
members
of

are
unconscious
of
their
comparative
inferiority
and
are
ignorant
of

to

of

are
constantly
aspiring
and
even
rendering
themselves
discontented
with

as
destiny
has
accorded
it
to
them
the
actual
condition
of
women
in
the
east
is
not
then
so
much
to
be
lamented
as
their
ideal
of
happiness
so
essentially
differs
from
that
of
other
portions
of
the
fair
sex
in
europe
or
america
as
no
other
philosophy
has
yet
crept
into
their
minds
they
dream
not
of
rights
free
love
or
equality
of
the

and
calmly
content
themselves
with
the
rights
of
nature
and
the
relative
position
which
has
ever
existed
among
their
simple
and
patriarchal
ancestors
the
osmanlis
have
not
yet
deviated
from
the
form
of
family
government
which
nature
dictated
to
them
the
venerable
father
who
has
guided
his

even
counseled
them

the

are
embodied
in

of
pater

each
son
as
he
succeeds
to
the
paternal
duties
is
invested
with
the
robes
of
veneration
and
respect
thus
the
male
branches
of
the
household
have
a
prior
rank
which
is
unconsciously
recognized
by
the
women
and
younger
members
of
the
family
the
laws
even
allow
to
the
son
double
the
share
of
inheritance
that
they
do
to
the
daughters
because
of
the
heavy
responsibilities
which
may
devolve
upon
him
in
future
by
the
death
of
the

there
is
not
therefore
the
most
distant
suspicion
in
their
composition
that
females
are
equal
to
males
or
girls
to
boys
it
is
as
if
the
members
of
the
body
should
revolt
and
the
hands
and
feet
proclaim
themselves
superior
or
even
equal

the
women
of
turkey
know
very
well
and
gracefully
submit
to
facts
which
are
stubborn
things
they
never
think
of
denying
that
women
first
were
made
for
men
not
men
for
them
there
are
countries
where
the
condition
of
woman
is
indeed
miserable
and
where
also
they
are
unconscious
of
their
own
degradation
and
willingly
toil
and
drudge
in
the
service
of
men
content
with
the
slightest
proofs
of
affection
with
which
their
lords
may
honor
them
indeed
any
concession
to
their
woman
nature
is
thankfully
received
to
be
bought
and
sold
is
a
matter
of
course
in
china
the
purchased
wife
is
suddenly
transported
into
the
family
of
a
man
whose
name
even
she
has
never
heard
there
she
is
the
slave
of
the
whole
establishment
the
husband
may
beat
her
with
impunity
reduce
her
to
a
state
of
starvation
or
hire
her
out

he
fancies
to
do

such
barbarities
are
unknown
in
turkey
for
in
no
country
in
the
world
are
mothers
more
respected
wives
more
tenderly
cherished
and
children
more
idolized
if
in
the
relative
position
of
the
sexes
men
rank
above
women
it
is
because
the
man
is
considered
as
the
vital
principle
and
the
woman
the
material
hence
the
man
loves
and
cherishes
the
woman
who
in
return
regards
him
with
reverence
and
respect
and
any
deviation
from
these
reciprocal
affections
would
be
considered
as
the
greatest
breach
of
decorum
there
are
certain
acts
of
politeness
which
devolve
altogether
upon
the
lords
of
creation
in
the
most
exquisitely
civilized
regions
of
the
world
which
are
however
sometimes
reluctantly
performed
but
as
usual
such
matters
are
reversed
in
the
east
where
even
the
sun
rises
at
a
different
hour
there
the
efendi
graciously
receives
a
glass
of
water
at
the
hands
of
his
too
happy
hanum
his
pipe
and
his
coffee
are
gracefully
served
by
some
fair
hebe
of
a
wife
or
sister
who
naturally
considers
herself
as
the
helpmeet
for
her
spouse
as
did
eve
the
first
and
fairest
of
woman
kind
the
reluctance
they
feel
to
have
their
ladies
appear
in
general
society
does
not
arise
from
any
want
of
deference
and
respect
on
the
part
of
the
men
but
rather
from
an
intuitive
desire
to
guard
and
protect
them
from
public
scandal
as
the
osmanlis
enshrine
the
objects
of
their
affection
in
the
recesses
of
their
own
hearts
so
they
love
to
guard
them
from
all
contact
of
a
selfish
world
indeed

beautifully
expressed
their

they
feel
so
sensitive
on
this
score
that
they
do
not
make
their
harems
a
subject
of
conversation
even
the
most
distant
allusion
to
this
part
of
their
establishment
would
consequently
be
not
only
indelicate
but
also
an
infringement
of
etiquette
so
that
the
ordinary
questions
such
as
how
are
madam
and
the
ladies
or
according
to
irish
vocabulary
how
yer
wife
and
the
gals
would
cause
the
lord
of
the
house
to
redden
with
astonishment
as
a
further
proof
of
the
respect
a
man
is
supposed
to
feel
for
his
family
his
enemy
when
wishing
to
touch
him
to
the
quick
in
cursing
him
only
utters
maledictions
against
his
wife
mother
or
sister
a
man
may
be
publicly
executed
but
a
woman
is
sacked
entirely
out
of

a

queen
of
her

sometimes
even
a

sentiment
entirely
protects

should
accost
them

the
commonest
citizen
would
immediately
turn
avenger
when
the

are
attended
by

and
eunuchs
they
are
only
appendages
of
rank
and
distinction
they
seem
indeed
to
be
a
privileged
class
wherever
they
appear
the

must
retire
and
woe
to
the
man
who
ventures
upon
a
warfare
of
words
with
a
turkish
woman
for
her
tongue
has
no
bounds
and
her
slipper
is
a
ready
weapon
of
chastisement
and
no
man
would
dare
to
repel
the
attack
the
convenience
of

to
have
been
familiar

doubtless
many
of

can
testify
to
its
abuse

in
these
days
of
modern

the
very
whims
and
caprices
which
seem
indigenous
to
the
fair
sex
are
tolerated
as
a
matter
of

with
philosophic
resignation
as
they
are
instructed
by
the
koran
if
ye
be
kind
towards
women
and
fear
to
wrong
them
god
is
well
acquainted
with
what
ye
do
they
have
a
proverb
also
which
supplants
all
reasoning
on
such
occasions
long
hair
short
brains
to
salute
a
lady
or
in
any
way
accost
her
in
public
would
be
an
act
of
consummate
rudeness
even
a
husband
would
pass
by
his
wife
and
family
with
an
air
of
affected
indifference
certainly
such
a
neglect
of
the
fair
sex
would
be
unpardonable
in
europe
and
this
country
but
on
the
contrary
in
the
east
it
only
evinces
the
greatest
deference
and
respect
nevertheless
the
mohammedans
have
been
most
maliciously
reported
by
ignorant
writers
on
the
east
to
hold
that
women
have
no
souls
or
if
they
have
that
they
will
perish
like
those
of
brute
beasts
this
assumption
is
founded
upon
the
promise
of
the
prophet
that
the
faithful
shall
be
provided
with
houris
in
paradise
if
this
excludes
the
mussulman
women
from
paradise
we
may
reasonably
place
the
christian
ladies
in
the
same
category
for
they
are
assured
in
the
gospel
that
there
will
be
no
marrying
nor
giving
in
marriage
in
heaven
on
the
contrary
houris
are
but
an
addition
to
the
earthly
wives
of
the
mussulmans
and
the
faithful
are
assured
that
god
promiseth
unto
the
true
believers
both
men

through

wherein
they
shall
remain

generally
exceedingly
fair
and
of
the
most
delicate
softness
owing
to
the
constant
use
of
the
bath
as
well
as
the
protection
of
the
yashmack
or
veil
without
which
they
never
go
abroad
their
features
are
very
regular
and
their
almond
shaped
eyes
so
much
sung
by
their
poets
are
dark
and
lustrous
and
so
valued
for
their
size
that
the
enjoyment
of
the
ladies
is
promised
by
mohammed
as
one
of
the
sublimest
joys
of
paradise
the
power
of
these
electric
and
darkly
beautiful
orbs
is
so
terrible
that
woe
to
those
upon
whom
they
are
turned
for
as
pertev

one
of
their
celebrated
poets
has
described
on
the
point
of
each
ray
that
is
darted
from
those
bright
meteors
there
is
a
bloody
slaughter

or
as
the
french
would
expressively
say
un
regard
assassin
exquisitely
arched
eyebrows
are
also
so
essential
to
their
ideas
of
beauty
that
they
are
never
contented
till
by
the
repeated
application
of
artificial
means
they
raise
their
brows
to
a
lofty
semicircle
beauty
spots
or
moles
are
considered
of
great
value
and
if
nature
has
proved
niggard
in
this
respect
art
is
brought
into
requisition
to
produce
the
same
contrasting
effect
between
the
tiny
circle
of
jetty
hue
and
the
surrounding
fairness
the
poet
hafiz
has
sung
their
value
in
flowing
numbers
offering
the
wealth
of
semerkand
and
bokhara
for
the
possession
of
the
indian
mole
on
the
cheek
of
the
fair
beauty
of
shiraz
the
tips
of
their
fingers
and
toes
are
frequently
stained
with
henna
producing
the
roseate
hue
so
much
à

mode
their
forms
and
movements
are
graceful
being
under
no
artificial
restraints
and
there
is
an
exquisite
charm
about
them
as
they
languidly
lounge
on
their
silken
couches
or
glide
about
from
room
to
room
in
long
flowing
robes
and
well
has
the
illustrious
bard
portrayed
the
varied
charms
of
the
eastern
houris

like
flowers
of

clime
and

some
exotic
garden
sometimes
found
with
cost
and
care
and
warmth
induced
to
shoot
considering
their
limited
education
it
is
delightful
to
listen
to
the
melodious
tone
of
their
voices
as
they
speak
with
remarkable
purity
the
harmonious
turkish
language
notwithstanding
their
lack
of

there
have
been
some

domestic
arrangements
the
interior
arrangements
of
the
turkish
apartments
and
their
furniture
are
very
peculiar
and
quite
unlike
those
of
european
or
american
drawing
rooms
being
entirely
adapted
to
the
habits
and
tastes
of
the
orientals
there
is
never
any
doubt
or
hesitation
as
to
the
place
suitable
to
be
occupied
by
any
one
who
may
happen
to
enter
a
room
nor
is
it
possible
to
mistake
the
different
ranks
of
its
occupants
generally
there
is
a
sofa
on
three
sides
of
the
room
sufficiently
ample
to
accommodate
the
ladies
in
their
style
of
sitting
which
is
not
as
is
usually
represented
in
pictures
but
with
the
limbs
folded
under
their
persons
and
carefully
concealed
by
the
drapery
of
their
long
robes
for
to
show
these
parts
of
the
person
while
sitting
is
considered
a
great
breach
of
etiquette
hence
no
osmanli
lady
is
ever
to
be
seen
perched
on
the
very
edge
of
the
sofa
but
leaving
her
slippers
on
the
floor
she
steps
upon
the
couch
and
gracefully
bending
her
knees
sits
reclining
against
the
cushions
behind
her
on
the
floor
at
the
foot
of
the
sofa
are
placed
mattresses
furnished
with
cushions
and
these
are
called
erkean
mindery
or
seats
of
homage
where
humbler
visitors
or
members
of
the
family
are
allowed
to
place
themselves
the
angles
or
corners
of
the
sofa
are
regarded
as
the
seats
of
honor
and
the
places
on
either
side
rank
in
regular
succession
down
to
the
seat
of
homage
but
the
most
honorable
person
in
the
company
may
at
her
or
his
option
occupy
any
part
of
the
couch
when
the
rest
place
themselves
on
each
side
according
to
their
own
rank
the
servants
are
always
present
and
stand
in
a
row
at
the
lower
end
of
the
room
their
arms
humbly
folded
on
their
girdles
attentive
to
the
slightest
nod
of
their
superiors
there
are
several
windows
on
each
of
the
three
sides
of
the
room
so
as
to
permit
a
full
view
of
the
surrounding
scenery
while
they
are
seated
for
the
osmanlis
are
very
fond
of
sunlight
and
the
beauties
of
nature
the
windows
of
the
harem
are
all
furnished
with
close
lattices
permitting
those
within
to
see
without
being
seen
the
more
modernized
salons
have
only
a
sofa
on
one
side
european
couches
chairs
tables
and
mirrors
being
substituted
for
the
other
sofas
they
also
endeavor
to
imitate
the
europeans
in
the
style
of
the
window
draperies
which
are
often
of
the
most
brilliant
hues
there
is
one
peculiarity
in
the
oriental
houses
you
may
wander
from
one
end
to
the
other
and
not
see
a
single
or
any
of
its
appurtenances
which
has
induced
many
persons
to
report
them
as
sleeping
on
the
sofas
and
never
dressing
or
undressing
it
would
however
seem
more
natural
to
suppose
that
the
osmanlis
never
had
any
but
day
dreams
the
fact
is
that
the
beds
are
all
packed
away
in
large
closets
during
the
and
spread
upon
the
floor
at
night
in
the
houses
of
the
wealthy
the
mattresses
and
coverlets
are
made
of
the
richest
materials
and
the
sheets
of
beautiful
silk
gauze
manufactured
in
broossa
the
whole
appearance
of
the
bed
so
brilliant
in
hue
and
rich
in
ornament
is
very
different
from
the
style
of
a
european
couch
every
house
has
an
infinite
number
and
variety
of
extra
beds
and
bedding
to
be
spread
on
the
floors
of
any
of
the
apartments

however
and
in
the
families
of
the

of
those
pashas
who
have
resided

bedsteads
have
been
introduced
upon

the
usual
method
of
warming
the
houses
is
by

the
mangal
is
generally
made
of
brass
highly
polished
somewhat
in
the
form
of
an
about

a
half
high
and
two
or
two

a
half
in
diameter

contains
a
large
pan
of
ignited
charcoal
the
tandur
consists
of
a
wooden
frame
about
the
height
and
size
of
a
table
lined
with
tin
under
which
a
pan
of
fire
is
placed
and
the
whole
is
covered
with
a
thickly
wadded
quilt
this
is
surrounded
by
sofas

the
covering

cozy

until
you
wonder
how
ever
a

of
miserable
imprisoned
women
should
be
such
arrant
gossips
ah
one
can
not
believe
the
fair
sex
so
unjust
to
themselves
even
in
turkey
as
to
neglect
the
observation
of
those
interesting
little
items
of
public
or
retired
life
which
become
great
and
weighty
affairs
when
discussed
by
ruby
lips
and
in
the
cadence
of
voices
they
possess
a
most
love
of
and
so
little
do
they
covet
repose
for
their
delicate
jaws
that
should
conversation
lag
they
keep
them
in
motion
by
the
use
of
mastic
which
is
always
in
readiness
preserved
in
little
jewelled
boxes
it
is
only
of
late
years
that
those
hot
repelling
machines
called
stoves
have
been
introduced
but
they
have
by
no
means
superseded
the
social
and
tandur
whose
warmth
and
luxurious
cushions
often
beguile
its
occupants
to
slumber
during
which
the
fire
is
overturned
and
thus
occur
many
of
the
conflagrations
so
frequent
in
turkey
there
are
two
occasions
when
the
still
air
resounds
with
the
echoes
of
human
voices
the
chant
of
the
muezzin
from
the
minaré
slowly
and
musically
vibrating
through
the
atmosphere
enticing
all
to
linger
at
the
casement
or
in
the
thoroughfare
to
catch
its
melodious
accents
and
the
terrible
cry
of
yangun
var
fire
fire
accompanied
by
the
reverberations
of
the
watchman
club
striking
upon
the
pavement
a
thrill
of
horror
pervades
every
heart
for
there
are
no
bounds
to
the
devouring
element
there
are
two
towers
one
at
the
seraskér
in
the
city
itself
and
the
other
on
the
galata
hill
which
command
an
extensive
isometrical
view
of
the
whole
metropolis
and
its
suburbs
here
guards
are
stationed
who
descry
the
first
indications
of
fire
and
immediately
give
from
the
top
of
the
towers
the
requisite
signal
by
hoisting
in
the
an
immense
globe
painted
red
and
at
night
by
producing
a
bright
and
steady
light
these
signals
remain
until
the
fire
is
extinguished
at
candilly
on
the
asiatic
shore
of
the
bosphorus
and
half
way
up
the

are
a

soon
as
the

are

number
of

neöbetgees
are

to

the

create
a
tremendous
sensation
as
they
rush
wildly
about
brandishing
their
batons
of

and
with
a
protracted
yell
warning
every
one
to
clear
the

the
different

take
up
the

there
is

the
firemen
assemble
at
their

to
the
scene
these
firemen
receive
no
pay

are
exempt
from
taxes

allowed
certain
other
privileges
yet
they
always
manage
to
extort
certain
compensations
for
their
services
from
the
victims
of
the
devastating
element
the
engines
are
small
and
portable
on
account
of
the
narrowness
and
steepness
of
the
streets
nor
is
there
any
attached
to
them
the
water
being
supplied
with
buckets
yet
it
is
astonishing
how
much
they
effect
even
with
such
inadequate
means
the
inflammable
materials
of
which
the
houses
are
constructed
the
narrow
streets
winding
up
the
hillside
like
the
irregular
and
projecting
dwellings
from
which
the
people
could
shake
hands
with
their
opposite

it
were
only
the

when

from

to
house
the
burning
cinders
fly
in
all
directions
and
the
fire
kindles
at
many
and
distant
points
so
that
in
less
than
half
an
hour
a
large
district
is
often
wrapt
in
flames
the
general
panic
is
so
intense
that
the
whole
community
is
roused
the
pashas

their
couches

even
the

himself
sometimes
repairs
to

animate
by
his

social
intercourse
it
seems
something
of
an
anomaly
that
a
race
of
beings
so
distinguished
for
selfishness
should
be
so
exceedingly
social
in
their
inclinations
birds
of
a
feather
flock
together
and
man
loves
his
fellow
though
he
loves
himself
better
to
prevent
the
inroad
of
this
extreme
selfishness
certain
forms
and
ceremonies
are
established
in
every
community
where
there
is
any
interchange
of
mutual
civilities
oriental
life
has
many
distinguishing
peculiarities
and
characteristic
forms
of
politeness
but
unlike
other
parts
of
the
globe
etiquette
in
the
east
is
permanent
and
general
the
mental
accomplishments
being
but
few
wealth
seems
to
constitute
the
only
aristocratic
distinction
while
the
poorest
and
the
richest
are
equally
well
versed
in
the
established
routine
of
civility
it
is
curious
to
observe
the
native
refinement
even
of
the
lower
classes
in
turkey
there
is
no
gaucherie
no
reluctance
in
any
one
to
do
the
right
thing
in
the
right
way
and
place
no
fear
of
being
unlike
other
distinguished
personages
in
manners
and
customs
for
there
is
no
doubt
as
to
the
prescribed
and
most
elegant
style
of
conduct
even
the
salutations
compliments
and
congratulations
are
most
carefully
worded
and
any
deviation
from
the
formula
would
destroy
the
intended
effect
there
is
consequently
no
lack
of
social
etiquette
among
the
osmanlis
a
visitor
is
received
according
to
her
station
in
life
and
after
being
announced
is
met
by
the
lady
of
the
house
with
her
suite
at
the
head
of
the
staircase
or
at
the
door
of
the
saloon
or
sometimes
by
merely
stepping
down
from
the
sofa
as
may
be
demanded
by
the
rank
of
the
guest
there
is
no
ceremony
of
introducing
one
person
to
another
nor
is
there
any
shaking
of
hands
the
company
salute
each
other
without
any
regard
to
previous
acquaintance
and
the
younger
members
of
society
always
kiss
the
hem
of
the
garment
or
the
hands
of
their
superiors
in
rank
and
age
the
manner
of
salutation
varies
those
of
equal
rank
endeavor
to
kiss
the
hem
of
each
other
garments
or
only
exchange
temennas
the
temenna
which
has
already
been
described
is
a
graceful
salutation
and
is
used
as
frequently
as
thank
you
by
the
english
serving
as
an
acknowledgment
for
all
compliments
and
kind
inquiries
when
one
thinks
of
the
innumerable
occasions
on
which
this
expressive
temenna
is
called
into
action
it
seems
as
if
a
whole
chapter
would
scarcely
suffice
to
describe
them
all
but
we
will
content
ourselves
with
its
demonstration
upon
the
arrival
of
a
guest
among
a
company
of
some
fifteen
or
twenty
persons
as
soon
as
the
visitor
is
seated
the
lady
welcomes
her
guest
by
a
temenna
which
is
acknowledged
by
the
same
signal
and
reiterated
by
each
person
in
the
company
successively
according
to
her
rank
now
another
round
commences
the
lady
of
the
house
makes
a
new
temenna
which
signifies
how
do
you
do
another
temenna
from
the
visitor
is
equivalent
to
an
acknowledgment
of
thanks
who
with
the
same
gesture
intimates
a
desire
to
know
the
state
of
her
hostess
health
the
whole
company
then
in
succession
follow
suit
to
each
of
whom
the
visitor
replies
in
the
same
way
this
style
of
receiving
company
might
be
ludicrously
illustrated
in
american
society
by
substituting
bows
for
temennas
if
indeed
the
ladies
could
be
expected
to
preserve
the
requisite
silence
and
gravity
of
demeanor
in
turkey
every
attention
or
compliment
brings
its
train
of
temennas
and
it
is
much
to
be
regretted
that
no
mathematician
has
yet
arisen
in
turkey
capable
of
producing
a
regular
formula
for
their
exact
computation
the
meddahs
however
or
the
famous
of
the
east
who
are
the
best
critics
sometimes
endeavor
to
exhibit
the
danger
of
too
great
an
excess
in
this
act
of
politeness
they
say
there
was
once
a
worthy
hodja
or
schoolmaster
who
was
very
punctilious
desirous
that
all
his
scholars
should
realise
the
importance
of
true
politeness
he
insisted
that
when
he
drank
water
not
a
single
one
of
them
should
omit
to
exclaim
with
a
respectful
temenna
afiyet
olsoun
hodja
efendy
or
may
it
do
you
much
good
respected
master
and
when
he
sneezed
they
were
all
to
clap
their
hands
and
vociferate
hayr

or
good
luck
to
the
master
the
means
employed
by
this
worthy
schoolmaster
to
enforce
his
lessons
may
be
readily
guessed
by
others
of
the
same
profession
but
that
the
desired
effect
was
produced
there
is
no
doubt
there
was
a
deep
well
from
which
the
scholars
had
to
draw
water
for
their
own
use
one
day
it
was
reported
to
the
teacher
that
the
bucket
had
fallen
in
the
well
who
after
many
vain
attempts
to
fish
it
up
resolved
to
descend
by
means
of
a
rope
and
the
scholars
were
called
upon
to
assist
in
his
descent
and
ascent
the
hodja
was
accordingly
lowered
down
into
the
well
and
at
a
given
signal
the
boys
began
to
pull
him
up
but
as
he
approached
the
mouth
of
the
well
the
change
of
the
atmosphere
titillating
his
nostrils
unfortunately
made
him
sneeze
when
the
pupils
instinctively
making
the
temenna
and
clapping
their
hands
let
go
the
rope
and
shouted
hayr

hodja
efendy
good
luck
to
the
master
but

after
the
visitor
is
seated
and
the
usual
temennas
are
exchanged
long
chibouks
with
amber
mouthpieces
set
in
diamonds
are
offered
by
the
halayiks

after
which
sweetmeats
are

with
goblets
of

this
beverage
is
served
in
small
porcelain
cups
in
stands
of
silver

gold
sometimes
enamelled
and
set
in

is
thus
poetically

are
never

as
matters
of

their
intercourse
with
each

is
most
unsophisticated
mutual
criticism
and
inspection
of
toilets
catechising
about
prices
are
indulged
in
as
matters
of
course
and
if
by
chance
the
guest
is
a
european
lady
the
scrutiny
is
the
more
intense
so
that
those
who
desire
to
visit
turkish
harems
must
go
prepared
to
undergo
the
most
thorough
examination
with
smiles
and
good
humor
the
only
satisfaction
being
a
genuine
retaliation
upon
the
fair
hanums
who
would
feel
exceedingly
flattered
thereby
and
by
no

the
whole

way
of
entertaining
them

frequently

themselves

chapter

polygamy
it
is
true
that
a
harem
is
generally
composed
of
an
assemblage
of
women
but
not
such
as
the
public
usually
imagine
although
the
mussulmans
are
allowed
by
the
koran
to
have
several
wives
there
are
few
who
have
more
than
one
especially
at
the
present
day
a
fact
not
to
be
however
attributed
to
any
new
code
of
morality
but
rather
to
the
coercion
of
circumstances
it
was
the
practice
of
the
arabs
to
have
eight
or
ten
wives
whom
they
were
seldom
able
to
maintain
mohammed
wishing
to
remedy
this
evil
and
not
altogether
to
abolish
ancient
usages
limited
the
number
take
in
marriage
of
such
women
as
please
you
two
or
three
or
four
and
not
more
but
if
ye
fear
that
ye
can
not
act
equitably
to
so
many
marry
only
one
or
the
slaves
which
ye
shall
have
acquired
they
were
allowed
to
marry
a
greater
number
of
slaves
as
their
dowry
was
much
smaller
and
they
were
maintained
in
a
very
different
style
from
the
free
women
as
the
osmanlis
have
a
remarkable
love
of
offspring
it
often
happens
that
a
man
having
had
no
children
by
a
wife
and
unwilling
to
divorce
her
which
is
considered
discreditable
takes
a
second
one
in
imitation
of
abraham
and
jacob
and
many
other
patriarchs
of
old
whose
practices
were
but
the
type
of
the
habits
of
all
oriental
people
even
those
of
the
present
day
but
such
a
step
being
often
the
source
of
domestic
difficulty
the
substitution
of
a
slave
in
the
place
of
a
second
wife
is
generally
preferred
and
such
slaves
are
retained
in
the
harem
with
the
appellation
of
odaluk
or
handmaid
like
hagar
bilhah
and
zilpah
when
these
odaluks
become
mothers
by
right
of
their
maternity
they
acquire
their
freedom
and
are
considered
second
wives
a
man
may
however
be
induced
to
contract
a
second
marriage
either
from
mercenary
or
ambitious
motives
when
circumstances
or
selfish
inclinations
induce
the
mussulmans
to
have
several
wives
they
are
obliged
to
assign
to
each
one
private
apartments
and
attendants
these
ladies
although
often
living
under
the
same
roof
visit
each
other
with
all
the
etiquette
of
perfect
strangers
and
require
an
expenditure
for
retinue
and
accommodations
which
can
only
be
sustained
by
wealth
besides
all
partiality
being
out
of
the
question
there
is
great
cause
for
jealousy
among
the
different
members
of
such
establishments
and
the
less
favored
being
ever
ready
for
intrigue
conspire
to
render
the
husband
most
miserable
and
the
sanctuary
a
perfect
bedlam
and
the
ambition
of
a
second
wife
sometimes
can
only
be
satisfied
by
the
sacrifice
of
her
rival
fethi
ahmed
pasha
was
so
favored
by
the
sultan
that
his
majesty
bestowed
his
sister
upon
him
in
marriage
notwithstanding
this
alliance
with
royalty
the
wife
and
children
of
his
humbler
fortunes
retained
their
place
in
his
memory
but
he
could
only
visit
them
in
secret
the
author
has
on
several
occasions
assisted
to
his
incognito
as
he
left
his
state
barge
and
proceeded
en
bourgeois
in
a
small
cayik
to
visit
the
house
of
his
affections
there
is
therefore
every
reason
to
believe
that
our
mussulman
friends
will
soon
come
to
the
conclusion
that
polygamy
may
well
be
held
in
dread
not
only
as
a
sin
but
as
a
bore
notwithstanding
then
the
toleration
of
polygamy
by
the
prophet
it
is
evident
that
circumstances
have
combined
to
restrict
this
practice
and
most
particularly
the
abolition
of
the
circassian
to
a
certain
extent
has
created
an
effectual
check
to
the
use
of
odaluks
thus
increasing
the
necessity
of
alliances
between
the
members
of
different
families
which
were
formerly
avoided
because
the
wife
being
surrounded
and
supported
by
her
own
relations
attained
an
undue
share
of
domestic
power
and
influence
especially
when
alliances
are
formed
with
royalty
the
circumstances
are
most
aggravating
the
husband
then
becomes
an
abject
slave
and
has
tacitly
to
submit
to
the
caprices
of
his
spouse
he
can
not
enter
the
harem
of
his
sultana
unless
especially
sent
for
nor
can
he
postpone
his
attendance
to
her
summons
no
matter
what
his
circumstances
or
occupation
may
be
the
sultan
has
often
been
seen
sleeping
in
a
corner
of
a
sofa
at
the
selamluk
till
two
or
three
in
the
morning
awaiting
the
pleasure
of
his
royal
mistress
while
she
on
her
part
was
amusing
herself
in
the
harem
with
dancing
girls
music
the
pasha
embarrassment
has
also
been
very
evident
when
he
has
been
obliged
to
leave
the
company
abruptly
no
apology
being
necessary
on
such
occasions
the
entrance
of
the
sable
messenger
with
a
single
temenna
intimating
the
absolute
command
of
the
royal
wife
who
generally
dismisses
her
train
of
ladies
and
slaves
before
he
makes
his
appearance
it
is
with
the
desire
to
avoid
such
petticoat
government
that
the
young
men
do
not
contract
alliances
with
ladies
of
rank
and
distinction
preferring
to
marry
their
own
slaves
or
to
content
themselves
with
the
odaluks
which
their
mothers
bestow
upon
them
to
keep
them
within
the
home
circle
and
out
of
mischief
sometimes
they
are
forced
to
a
second
marriage
by
the
bestowal
of
a
bride
from
a
superior
in
power
whose
orders
they
can
not
refuse
a
great
number
of
women
then
in
any
harem
is
by
no
means
a
sure
sign
of
the
uxorious
disposition
of
its
master
but
is
rather
an
indication
of
his
personal
rank
and
wealth
for
the
osmanlis
men
and
women
are
proverbially
fond
of
display
they
say
sense
belongs
to
europe
wealth
to
india
beauty
to
georgia
but
show
and
display
are
the
attributes
of
the
osmanlis
alone
they
therefore
delight
in
all
the
appendages
of
luxury
and
surround
themselves
with
crowds
of
attendants
this
oriental
propensity
has
even
been
sustained
by
the
prophet
himself
who
says
that
the
very
meanest
in
paradise
will
have
servants
while
then
the
gentleman
in
the
selamluk
has
his
steward
treasurer
pipe
bearer
the
hanum
on
her
part
has
her
own
appropriate
suite
which
is
in
many
instances
more
numerous
than
that
of
her
efendy
this
is
particularly
true
with
regard
to
the
sultanas
or
sisters
and
daughters
of
the
sultan
whose
husbands
are
not
allowed
to
behold
the
faces
of
any
of
the
fair
maidens
in
the
royal
train
except
by
special
permission
of
the
sultanas

marriage
and

marriage
is
considered
honorable
in
all
but
most
especially
among
the
osmanlis
who
enter
into
this
condition
as
they
arrive
at
the
age
of
puberty
the
independent
state
of
bachelorship
is
therefore
unknown
among
them
or
if
such
an
accident
should
happen
the
unfortunate

is
styled

or
useless
member
of
society
which
stigma
it
is
needless
to
say
they
by
no
means
covet
as
for
old
maids
there
is
not
a
word
in
the
language
descriptive
of
that
class
of
women
the
preliminaries
of
all
marriages
are
effected
by
the
parents
who
not
only
thus
spare
their
children
much
trouble
and
embarrassment
but
use
all
their
own
wisdom
and
experience
of
genuine
terrestrial
happiness
in
providing
for
their
own
offspring
besides
parental
authority
is
supreme
and
filial
obedience
equally
innate
hence
it
never
enters
into
the
calculations
of
the
young
to
weary
themselves
with
the
anticipatory
illusions
of
love
though
sometimes
when
old
enough
they
join
in
the
matrimonial
deliberations
marriage
is
not
a
religious
but
rather
a
civil
contract
among
the
mussulmans
and
the
ceremony
is
as
simple
as
in
protestant
countries
this
ceremony
which
is
called
nikeah
is
effected
by
proxies
and
there
is
always
a
fixed
sum
settled
upon
the
bride
according
to
the
condition
of
the
party
this
nikeah
constitutes
the
legal
marriage
but
the
bride
does
not
go
to
her
husband
home
until
three
or
four
months
have
elapsed
at
which
time
the
friends
assemble
to
partake
of
the
nuptial
festivities
which
continue
during
four
days
and
always
end
on
thursday
as
the
following
day
is
the
turkish
sabbath
upon
her
arrival
the
bride
is
met
at
the
door
of
the
harem
and
conducted
into
the
room
by
the
bridegroom
himself
who
carries
her
up
stairs
in
his
arms
and
placing
her
in
the
most
honorable
part
of
the
sofa
raises
her
veil
of
tinsel
and
takes
the
liberty
for
the
first
time
to
gaze
upon
the
features
of
his
beloved
separate
establishments
are
almost
unknown
in
turkey
the
bride
goes
to
the
house
of
her
husband
parents
so
that
the
family
circle
often
becomes
very
numerous
it
occasionally
happens
that
by
special
request
the
bridegroom
enters
the
family
of
his
wife
parents
which
however
is
considered
a
misfortune
for
they
say
itch

is
preferable
to
that

if
such
be
a
true
picture
of
human
nature
it
is
not
too
highly
drawn
for
a
country
where
polygamy
is
practised
since
it
is
no
hard
matter
for
a
man
to
part
with
one
wife
when
he
has
several
others
the
privilege
of
divorce
would
be
somewhat
tyrannical
if
allowed
only
to
the
men
but
in
turkey
the
women
themselves
may
exercise
this
prerogative
if
they
are
maltreated
or
not
properly
provided
for
with
at
least
the
requisite
bread

candles
a
man
may
put

merely
by
uttering
in
the
hearing
of
a
third
party
the
ominous
word
bosh
null
void
which
even
if
carelessly
spoken
renders
the
man
and

strangers
to
each
other
the

feeling
obliged
to
assume
her
veil
and
conceal
her
charms
and
in
case
of
reconciliation
a

it
is
fortunate
that

is
very
disreputable
and
is
seldom
practised
by
either
party
if
they
have
any
respect
for
public
opinion
or
regard
for
themselves
otherwise
wives
and
husbands
would
be
constantly
changing
hands
as
was
the
practice
among
the
old
arabs
in
the
time
of
mohammed
this
custom
was
decried
by
the
prophet
it
shall
not
be
lawful
for
thee
to
take
other
women
to
wife
hereafter
nor
to
exchange
any
of
thy
wives
for
them
the
moral
effect
of
a
facility
of
divorce
is
to
keep
both
parties
on
their
good
behavior
but
at
the
same
time
a
spirit
of
extreme
selfishness
is
induced
in
the
women
for
being
in
constant
apprehension
of
a
sudden
separation
they
look
upon
their
husbands
as
a
means
of
revenue
and
endeavor
to
store
up
as
much
jewelry
clothing
as
possible
to
be
ready
in
case
of
emergency
the
display
of
shawls
and
diamonds
upon
the
persons
of
women
even
of
the
poorest
classes
is
not
from
a
feeling
of
vanity
but
rather
an
exhibition
of
the
extent
of
the
personal
wealth
they
have
extorted
from
their
lords
and
masters
in
case
of
separation
the
children
are
supported
until
they
are
seven
years
old
by
the
father
after
which
the
boys
remain
under
the
paternal
care
and
the
girls
belong
to
the
mother
unless
some
other
arrangement
is
made
by
mutual
consent
the
most
unjust
stigma
of
illegitimacy
is
almost
unknown
in
turkey
the
children
by
slaves
being
as
respectable
and
legitimate
as
those
by
the
regular
wives
and
it
is
only
when
the
father
can
not
be
discovered
that
they
are
regarded
as
bastards
such
principles
are
certainly
right
and
more
humane
than
those
of
christian
lands
where
the
innocent
are
taunted
all
their
lifetime
with
the
immoralities
of
others
for
whose
actions
they
are
as
irresponsible
as
the

chapter

the
sultan
harem
although
there
are
more
than
women
in
the
palace
but
five
of
these
hold
the
rank
of
kaduns
or
wives
mussulmans
in
general
are
allowed
to
have
four
wives
but
sultans
can
have
seven
their
superiority
to
ordinary
men
is
thus
attested
and
the
chance
made
surer
of
an
heir
to
the
throne
it
will
therefore
be
perceived
that
polygamy
in
the
case
of
a
sultan
is
a
matter
of
policy
and
not
choice
for
even
should
he
content
himself
with
one
wife
the
state
would
interfere
the
design
of
limiting
his
majesty
wives
to
seven
is
to
spare
the
state
the
enormous
expense
attendant
upon
the
maintenance
of
so
many
ladies
of
royal
rank
the
present
sultan
however
in
asserting
his
prerogative
has
limited
the
number
to
five
which
while
it
shows
his
power
to
exceed
the
restrictions
upon
other
mussulmans
at
the
same
time
displays
an
inclination
not
to
burden
the
state
too
heavily
with
his
private
expenses
it
is
true
he
has
had
children
by
several
others
whom
custom
requires
to
be
elevated
to
the
rank
of
kaduns
but
he
has
retained
them
under
the
title
of
ikbals
or
favorites
for
the
sake
of
sparing
the
state
the
additional
expense
which
the
dignity
of
kaduns
would
require
the
sultan
being
above
all
law
can
not
submit
to
any
matrimonial
bondage
he
is
not
therefore
legally
married
to
any
of
his
wives
but
those
who
are
selected
by
him
to
share
his
affections
are
pronounced
by
him
kaduns
or
ladies
and
not
sultanas
for
none
but
those
of
the
royal
blood
can
enjoy
that
title
except
the
mother
of
the
reigning
sultan
who
on
her
son
accession
to
the
throne
takes
by
courtesy
this
title
and
is
called
validé
sultan
the
title
sultan
is
equally
applied
to
males
and
females
with
this
difference
only
that
it
precedes
the
name
of
the
male
and
follows
that
of
the
female
thus
they
say
sultan
but
for
his
sister
adilé
sultan
when
it
is
used
by
itself
it
always
implies
the
female
branch
of
the
royal
family
and
never
his
majesty
who
is
known
by
the
title
of
padishah
or
hünkear
or
in
common
parlance
efendimiz
our
lord
his
majesty
never
forming
an
alliance
with
any
of
his
subjects
all
his
kaduns
are
originally
georgian
or
circassian
slaves
who
are
selected
for
this
distinguished
honor
and
presented
to
him
by
his
mother
or
sisters
on
kadir
gedjessy
or
the
night
in
which
the
koran
descended
from
heaven
they
have
each
their
separate
establishments
and
retinue
in
the
palace
and
live
as
much
apart
as
if
in
different
dwellings
seldom
seeing
each
other
except
on
occasions
of
state
ceremony
and
etiquette
the
princes
of
the
royal
blood
also
reside
in
the
same
palace
who
if
of
age
have
their
own
odaluks
attendants
etc
it
may
be
supposed
that
in
such
a
royal
establishment
the
rising
generation
is
well
represented
but
on
the
contrary
few
of
them
are
allowed
to
prolong
their
lives
while
many
more
never
see
the
light
this
premature
destruction
of
life
though
strictly
prohibited
in
the
koran
is
very
prevalent
in
turkey
in
some
cases
from
lest
the
heirs
to
the
crown
should
become
too
numerous
and
in
others
from
a
false
desire
in
the
ladies
to
preserve
their
beauty
and
freshness
from
the
toils
and
trial
of
maternity
but
very
often
the
better
feelings
of
their
natures
are
sorely
tried
and
two
of
the
sisters
of
the
present
sultan
pined
away
in
sorrow
and
at
last
died
because
their
infant
sons
were
sacrificed
upon
the
altar
of
himself
in
his
younger
days
was
not
exempt
from
trials
of
this
sort
for
just
before
coming
to
the
throne
he
had
a
favorite
odaluk
to
whom
he
was
much
attached
but
as
the
princes
are
not
permitted
to
become
fathers
she
fell
a
victim
in
the
attempt
to
frustrate
the
probable
birth
of
an
heir
when
a
single
week
delay
would
have
elevated
her
to
the
rank
of
first
kadun
to
the
reigning
monarch
for
sultan
mahmoud
died
a
few
days
after
she
was
sacrificed
whenever
a
child
is
born
to
the
sultan
or
any
other
oriental
father
the
tidings
are
immediately
communicated
to
him
and
the
family
relatives
and
the
messenger
handsomely
rewarded
among
the
mussulmans
the
father
himself
pronounces
the
future
name
of
his
offspring
at
the
moment
of
its
birth
a
certain
man
having
scarce
passed
the
honeymoon
for
he
had
only
been
married
three
months
one
day
while
he
was
in
the
bath
was
suddenly
apprised
of
the
birth
of
a
son
and
heir
as
soon
as
he
recovered
from
his
surprise
at
such
an
unexpected
event
he
ordered
him
to
be
named
tchapgun
or
racer
because
said
he
he
has
accomplished
in
three
months
the
customary
labor
of
nine
they
have
a
singular
notion
that
the
reason
a
child
cries
as
soon
as
it
is
born
is
because
his
satanic
majesty
being
of
course
present
cruelly
pinches
the
tender
offshoot
of
humanity
the
only
exception
on
record
being
the
virgin
mary
and
jesus
christ
who
were
protected
from
the
touch
of
the
devil
by
a
veil
so
placed
by
allah
himself
thus
doubtless
accounting
for
the
immaculacy
of
the
holy
virgin
the
children
at
their
birth
are
rubbed
down
with
salt
and
nicely
bandaged
they
are
placed
in
a
cradle
and
secured
there
the
hands
and
feet
are
bound
in
so
that
the
child
can
not
move
the
poor
little
victim
becomes
black
and
blue
under
this
treatment
and
is
occasionally
relieved
from
its
fetters
to
be
in
swaddling
clothes
and
when
the
toilet
is
completed
it
very
much
resembles
a
little
egyptian
mummy
the
child
is
nursed
while
lying
down
the
mother
bending
over
it
and
tilting
the
cradle
until
she
attains
the
requisite
position
owing
to
the
bandages
in
which
the
infants
are
constantly
enveloped
the
circulation
of
the
blood
is
impeded
and
they
are
obliged
to
be
relieved
by
occasional
scarifications
and
the
writer
still
wears
the
honorable
scars
of
this
traditional
practice
when
the
sultan
wends
his
steps
from
the
mabeyn
to
the
harem
the
black
gentlemen
on
guard
at
the
door
of
the
ladies
apartments
proceed
immediately
to
announce
his
majesty
approach
to
the
or
the
lady
treasuress
this
personage
is
a
very
important
character
in
the
royal
household
being
the
keeper
of
all
the
jewels
and
other
treasures
and
the
mistress
of
ceremonies
she
is
in
a
word
that
dame
who
keeps
up
discipline
among
the
general
ranks
so
that
none
stir
or
talk
without
her
sanction
on
their
her
title
is
the
mother
of
the
maids
there
is
always
one
of
these
haznadars
attached
to
the
harems
of
the
wealthy
and
the
individual
who
fills
this
office
has
been
the
nurse
of
the
head
of
the
family
in
infancy
so
that
this
mother
of
the
maids
feels
almost
a
maternal
interest
in
his
majesty
happiness
the
immediately
proceeds
to
the
salon
where
she
awaits
the
entrance
of
the
sultan
who
after
receiving
her
salutations
in
the
course
of
conversation
inquires
after
the
health
of
one
of
the
kaduns
which
is
taken
as
an
indication
that
her
company
is
desired
by
his
majesty
this
kadun
now
enters
the
royal
presence
alone
or
perhaps
with
one
of
her
children
while
her
train
of
attendants
remain
within
call
like
all
other
orientals
the
padishah
delights
in
the
company
of
his
children
and
they
are
often
seen
in
public
with
him
or
in
the
royal
mabeyn
his
was
a
daughter
and
lately
married
to
pasha
the
son
of
reshid
the
children
of
the
sultan
precede
their
mother
in
rank
for
they
are
of
royal
blood
while
she
is
but
a
slave
hence
the
mother
always
takes
a
secondary
position
in
cayiks
carriages
or
in
the
saloon
of
reception
this
apparent
superiority
never
elates
the
children
nor
in
any
way
lessens
the
respect
which
they
feel
for
their
mothers
for
whilst
they
are
flattered
and
worshipped
as
and
sultans
or
princes
and
princesses
the
general
deference
paid
to
their
mothers
is
undiminished
they
have
a
proverb
which
is
very
expressive
of
their
feelings
on
this
subject
dagh

rather

the
late
or
mother
of
the
sultan
was
one
of
the
most
powerful
individuals
in
the
realm
and
her
patronage
most
assiduously
courted
his
majesty
and
his
harem
are
frequently
entertained
with
the
graceful
movements
and
merry
castanets
of
the
dancing
girls
the
osmanlis
are
very
fond
of
dancing
but
consider
it
inconsistent
with
their
own
dignity
they
always
have
beautiful
young
slaves
trained
in
this
accomplishment
and
also
made
proficient
in
the
music
of
the
country
turkish
music
is
very
unlike
that
of
european
countries
where
there
is
a
general
similarity
although
the
orientals
have
very
good
ears
for
music
and
treat
the
subject
scientifically
yet
it
is
strange
that
they
do
not
understand
the
harmony
of
sounds
for
all
their
concerts
both
vocal
and
instrumental
consist
of
solos
that
is
they
all
sing
and
play
only
the
air
or
tenor
and
never
the
bass
and
contralto
etc
the
natural
tones
of
their
voices
are
very
sweet
and
of
late
years
the
military
music
having
been
arranged
in
european
style
they
have
made
great
proficiency
in
this
art
the
opera
house
in
pera
is
also
very
attractive
to
the
turkish
gentlemen
and
much
frequented
by
them
the
sultan
has
his
loge
or
box
there
and
sometimes
honors
the
house
by
his
royal
presence
recently
the
piano
has
also
become
very
fashionable
among
them
and
it
is
to
be
heard
incessantly
jingling
in
all
the
harems
the
sultan
being
himself
an
amateur
frequently
plays
on
that
instrument
and
has
also
an
italian
opera
attached
to
his
palace
for
the
entertainment
of
his
ladies
where
many
of
the
female
slaves
are
trained
to
sing
and
act
à
la
italienne
in
the
costumes
of
both
sexes
the
ladies
of
the
palace
are
also
amused
with
other
exhibitions
which
they
witness
through
latticed
partitions
from
the
preceding
sketch
it
will
be
readily
understood
that
all
the
ladies
in
the
royal
palace
are
in
reality
slaves
from
the
regions
of
circassia
but
they
are
always
well
treated
and
even
addressed
by
the
title
of
hanums
or
ladies
and
we
may
say
their
greatest
hardship
is
being
lightly
clothed
all
seasons
of
the
year
their
feet
without
stockings
and
their
dresses
made
of
the
lightest
fabrics
from
which
fact
many
of
them
fall
easy
victims
to
consumption
these
ladies
are
not
allowed
to
go
abroad
as
freely
as
turkish
hanums
in
general
on
account
of
the
restrictions
of
court
etiquette
this
confinement
is
also
very
injurious
to
their
health
and
their
ennui
is
often
insupportable
sometimes
after
a
due
warning
to
all
the
gardeners
and
other
gentlemen
to
quit
the
premises
they
are
allowed
to
stroll
in
the
palace
gardens
and
occasionally
the
validé
sultan
takes
pity
on
some
of
them
and
permits
them
to
enjoy
a
promenade
in
her
own
train
when
the
exuberance
of
their
spirits
often
tempts
them
to
the
most
childish
acts
of
coquetry
indeed
so
great
is
their
longing
to
encounter
the
lords
of
creation
that
a
feigned
sickness
affords
an
occasion
of
seeing
a
doctor
and
their
favorite
remedy
for
all
ailments
is
bleeding
or
the
bleeder
these
beautiful
girls
having
no
other
ambition
than
to
be
as
fascinating
as
possible
and
such
aspirations
sometimes
seem
to
be
felt
in
more
enlightened
bosoms
they
do
not
like
to
waste
their
sweetness
on
the
desert
air
as
they
are
consequently
a
little
mischievous
the
practice
of
locking
up
each
one
in
her
own
apartments
has
been
deemed
advisable
when
the
muezzin
proclaims
the
hour
of
evening
prayer
the
disconsolate
ladies
are
severally
consigned
to
a
state
of
security
by
the
sable
turnkeys
of
the
palace
this
is
not
however
so
dismal
a
fate
when
we
remember
that
a
short
time
ago
all
the
inhabitants
of
stamboul
were
obliged
to
be
within
their
own
domiciles
about
two
hours
after
sunset
and
awhile
since
there
was
the
curfew
bell

in

old

xxx
circassian
slaves
although
the
slave
trade
has
been
nominally
abolished
in
turkey
and
the
public
mart
formally
closed
to
this
traffic
yet
the
practice
of
buying
and
selling
has
not
been
nor
will
it
ever
be
altogether
abandoned
because
the
slave
constitutes
an
essential
element
in
the
composition
of
their
domestic
institutions
there
are
two
kinds
of
servitude
in
every
house
one
the
ordinary
labor
of
domestic
service
the
other
that
of
personal
attendance
neither
of
which
the
free
mussulman
women
are
willing
to
perform
because
they
will
thereby
be
more
or
less
brought
in
contact
with
men
which
is
proscribed
by
the
koran
the
slave
service
therefore
becomes
necessarily
indispensable
with
the
mussulmans
whose
houses
have
hitherto
been
supplied
with
circassian
and
nubian
slaves
the
former
being
a
species
of
ladies
in
waiting
and
the
latter
performing
the
menial
services
of
the
household
the
average
price
of
the
slaves
is
according
to
the
tariff
of
the
for
the
white
and
for
the
black
they
bring
these
prices
when
they
arrive
fresh
from
their
native
lands
those
of
the
circassian
who
are
however
brought
into
the
country
in
childhood
and
carefully
educated
and
trained
in
accomplishments
attain
so
rare
a
style
of
beauty
and
delicacy
of
appearance
that
they
are
frequently
sold
for
or
though
the
restrictions
upon
the
trade
have
forced
turkish
families
to
employ
greek
and
armenian
women
in
their
houses
yet
there
is
always
a
demand
for
slaves
the
armenians
having
the
same
institution
as
the
mussulmans
the
harem
their
maidens
are
prevented
from
entering
any
family
as
servants
it
is
only
the
old
women
whose
charms
have
all
faded
and
gone
who
are
willing
to
expose
themselves
in
this
way
the
greeks
though
not
so
scrupulous
are
generally
ignorant
of
the
turkish
language
and
altogether
uncongenial
in
their
habits
and
ideas
so
that
they
are
unpopular
slaves
are
still
more
indispensable
in
the
palace
for
the
mussulman
prejudice
is
opposed
to
the
introduction
of
any
of
the
subjects
who
would
thus
come
in
contact
with
royalty
besides
is
his
majesty
to
form
an
alliance
with
his
subjects
the
circassian
parents
so
long
accustomed
to
the
benefits
derived
by
the
advancement
of
their
daughters
to
positions
of
comparative
ease
will
always
be
ready
and
anxious
to
supply
the
metropolis
and
the
traffic
notwithstanding
the
formal
prohibition
is
still
continued
at
private
houses
in
circassian
slavery
in
turkey
is
not
a
condition
of
servitude
all
the
children
who
are
born
from
odaluks
are
free
and
they
also
render
their
mothers
free
an
odaluk
may
be
sold
alone
but
never
after
she
has
become
a
mother
besides
the
maids
of
honor
or
ladies
in
waiting
at
the
palace
are
often
bestowed
in
marriage
upon
pashas
and
other
dignitaries
who
thus
consider
themselves
in
some
sense
allied
to
royalty
one
of
their
number
was
a
slave
to
validé
sultan
she
was
married
to
mehmed
bey
the
brother
of
the
sultan
with
the
idea
of
ameliorating
her
condition
but
being
very
by
her
husband
she
had
a
petition
written
and
presented
it
to
her
royal
patroness
whereupon
the
validé
summoned
the
husband
and
reprimanded
him
in
such
a
manner
that
he
became
exasperated
and
having
intoxicated
himself
with
racky
or
turkish
brandy
rushed
into
the
harem
and
plunged
his
dagger
into
the
breast
of
the
unfortunate
wife
sultan
mahmoud
lost
his
favorite
wife
and
was
so
much
grieved
by
her
death
that
he
ordered
her
apartments
to
be
locked
up
and
that
no
one
should
enter
them
he
only
spent
some
time
there
every
day
in
solitary
meditation
upon
his
lost
favorite
there
was
a
slave
girl
fourteen
or
fifteen
years
old
whose
duty
was
to
clean
the
bath
belonging
to
these
apartments
she
was
so
curious
to
know
why
these
rooms
were
always
locked
up
that
she
one
day
found
herself
on
an
exploring
expedition
by
means
of
the
private
staircase
finding
the
door
open
she
ventured
to
enter
the
apartment
when
lo
and
behold
there
was
the
awful
mahmoud
himself
he
said
how
dare
you
venture
here
do
you
not
know
my
express
commands
the
terrified
girl
fell
at
his
majesty
feet
and
craved
pardon
she
was
so
bewitching
in
this
posture
that
the
sultan
not
only
pardoned
her
but
invited
her
to
meet
him
every
day
in
the
same
place
till
at
last
he
ordered
that
the
apartments
should
be
appropriated
to
her
and
she
became
the
fifth
kadun
and
the
mother
of
the
present
sultan
it
is
the
idea
of
aspiring
to
such
honors
and
stations
near
even
royalty
itself
which
induces
the
circassian
parents
so
readily
to
sell
their
daughters
to
mussulmans
when
nothing
could
induce
them
to
barter
their
offspring
to
christians
no
wonder
that
each
simple
peasant
of
the
caucasus
fancies
slavery
in
the
metropolis
to
be
a
translation
from
poverty
to
an
earthly
elysium
when
tales
and
true
tales
too
not
the
enchantments
of
aladdin
wonderful
lamp
are
so
common
in
oriental
life
therefore
even
if
the
traffic
is
formally
prohibited
the
circassian
parents
will
force
their
offspring
into
the
market
not
only
to
ameliorate
their
condition
but
to
secure
favorable
alliances
for
themselves
so
that
if
the
legal
sum
be
not
hereafter
realized

is
a

impression
that
the

are
always
imprisoned
at

nothing
is
more
erroneous
for
since

it

the

at

composed
of
the

has
little
power
of
concealing

on

serves
to
heighten

the

doubtless
is
popular
that
beauty
never

even
the

slightly
to
encourage
their

by

furtive
glances

that
on

from

always
avoided
a

with

the

the

lighted
from

they
seem
like
long
streets
covered
with
arched
roofs
each
street
being
appropriated
to
some
particular
merchandise
thus
there
are
the
spice
bazaar
where
all

containing

space
occupied

is
equal
to
the
whole
of

in

city
of

and
the
internal
arrangements
are
entirely
unlike
the

there
are
no
front
windows
nor
counters
the
entire
façade
of
the
streets
being
shelved
for
the
display
of
wares

presents
a
whole
front
with
the
appearance
of
a
vast
library
not
of

but
of
merchandise

sort
of
elevated
platform
about
five
or
six
feet
wide
and
two
feet
from

extends
the

on
which
both
merchants
and
customers
sit
thus
serving
the
double
purpose
of
counter
and

the

are
divided
by

boards
and
a
small
room
is
attached
behind
each
for
the
storage
of

the

immense

which
are
closed
every

about
an
hour
before

and
are

in

the
whole
effect
is
very
interesting
the
fanciful

the
great
number
and
proximity
of
the
stalls

and
the
varied

of

to

are
continually

and
in

occasionally
the

of
the

are
obliged
to
leave
their
merchandise
for
a
short
time
and
during
their
absence
a
covering
of
suspended
across
the
front
of
the
stall
is
sufficient
to
indicate
the
absence
of
the
proprietor
and
also
to
protect
the
property
from
all
depredation
these
bazaars
are
the
favorite
resort
of
the
turkish
ladies
of
all
ranks
and
there
is
no
little
coquetry
displayed
by
the
fair
purchasers
when
the
unusually
handsome
appearance
of
the
merchant
tempts
them
literally
to
ransack
his
whole
establishment
for
the
most
trifling
article
these
occasions
are
also
made
available
for
the
purposes
of
flirtation
assignation
and
all
other
romantic
amusements
it
is
amusing
to
observe
the
ladies
as
they
fit
themselves
with
their
peculiarly
colored
and
shaped
chaussure
for
they
make
no
scruple
of
displaying
their
beautiful
ankles
which
are
generally
divested
of
every
semblance
of
hosiery
the
method
of
buying
and
selling
is
peculiar
to
the
country
and
doubtless
very
entertaining
to
strangers
the
system
of
is
unknown
in
turkey
for
as
they
go
on
the
principle
each
one
for
himself
no
one
is
content
with
any
price
except
his
own
valuation
besides
the
people
are
so
conceited
that
any
concession
on
the
part
of
the
merchant
is
flattering
to
their
vanity
he
therefore
enjoys
the
privilege
of
being
beaten
down
merely
as
complimentary
to
his
customers
so
the
merchant
always
demands
an
exorbitant
price
which
he
has
no
idea
of
receiving
in
order
to
give
his
customer
a
fair
chance
to
gratify
his
vanity
and
also
to
exercise
his
judgment
as
london
has
its
whitechapel
road
paris
its
temple
and
new

its
chatham
street
so
constantinople
has
its
emphatically
so
denominated

the
vermin
which
infest
old
clothing
infinite
diversity
pervades
the
garments
here
displayed
and
as
people
clothes
always
look
something
like
themselves
so
the
empty
garments
seem
to
tell
tales
of
their
good
or
bad
fortunes
whether
the
former
owners
died
of
plague
or
small
pox
were
solitary
occupants
of
the
robes
or
shared
them
with
other
animalculæ
at
the
auction
which
occurs
every

tobacco
ever
since
its
first
introduction
to
the
civilized
world
has
become
so
indispensable
an
item
of
consumption
that
it
has
long
been
ranked
among
the
staple
commodities
of
life
and
seems
to
claim
the
double
title
of
a
natural
and
artificial
taste
yet
no
form
of
pleasure
and
exhilaration
has
ever
been
the
subject
of
so
much
study
as
the
ways
and
means
of
enjoying
this
fragrant
weed
all
the
world
are
well
aware
of
the
different
forms
in
which
tobacco
is
used
inhaling
in
the
form
of
smoke
titillating
the
nostrils
by
its
powder
called
snuff
or
imbibing
the
juice
into
the
system
by
the
process
of
mastication
the
two
latter
forms
of
enjoying
this
luxury
seem
to
admit
of
no
refinement
as
time
has
rolled
on
and
snuffing
and
chewing
yet
remain
in
their
pristine
state
of
simplicity
on
the
contrary
no
ingenuity
has
been
spared
to
invent
improve
or
remodel
the
various
vehicles
by
which
the
more
exquisite
and
graceful
practice
of
smoking
may
be
enjoyed
although
tobacco
may
have
been
indigenous
to
america
yet
we
have
the
assertion
of
professor
beckman
to
corroborate
the
fact
that
this
plant
was
known
to
the
tartars
long
before
the
discovery
of
america
as
early
as
the
year
a
native
turk
was
paraded
through
the
streets
of
constantinople
with
a
pipe
transfixed
through
his
nose
as
the
penalty
of
indulging
in
the
pastime
of
smoking
which
was
then
in
great
disrepute
indeed
if
we
may
credit
tradition
mohammed
himself
predicted
that
in
times
to
come
there
should
be
men
bearing
the
name
of
mussulmans
but
not
really
such
who
should
smoke
a
certain
weed
called
dükhan
or
tobacco
tobacco
was
introduced
into
england
soon
after
the
discovery
of
columbus
by
sir
walter
raleigh
and
thence
found
its
way
into
europe
but
not
until
fifteen
years
after
do
we
hear
of
it
among
the
turks
whence
it
seems
that
the
orientals
must
have
acquired
their
knowledge
of
this
plant
through
some
other
channel
most
probably
from
their
tartar
neighbors
but
from
whatever
clime
we
first
derived
this
fragrant
weed
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
earliest
method
of
using
it
was
in
a
pipe
and
not
in
the
form
of
cigars
or
by
imbibing
the
juice
by
chewing
which
latter
practice
was
unknown
to
the
early
lovers
of
tobacco
and
is
unpractised
by
the
orientals
even
at
this
day
as
the
aromatic
plant
by
degrees
became
essential
to
the
happiness
of
mankind
even
including
the
fair
sex
doubtless
the
inconvenience
of
the
pipe
suggested
the
idea
of
a
more
portable
form
whence
the
invention
of
cigars
in
holland
in
they
smoked
out
of
conical
tubes
made
of
plaited
together
and
subsequently
the
leaf
of
the
plant
was
rolled
up
and
the
present
form
of
cigars
adopted
the
only
recommendation
to
the
form
of
cigars
is
their
convenience
but
many
amateurs
pretend
that
they
thus
attain
a
stronger
relish
of
the
tobacco
than
from
pipes
the
cigar
is
certainly
strong
in
its
fumes
but
whether
the
relish
is
greater
is
a
matter
to
be
questioned
and
in
this
form
the
injurious
and
even
poisonous
properties
of
the
plant
are
imparted
to
the
system
besides
there
is
the
close
proximity
of
the
fire
to
the
mouth
and
teeth
secondly
the
condensation
of
the
essential
oil
on
the
lips
leaving
a
yellow
tinge
around
the
mouth
thirdly
the
gradual
dissolving
of
the
end
of
the
cigar
in
the
mouth
producing
by
its
nicotine
property
irritation
of
the
gums
and
the
salivary
glands
fourthly
there
is
the
necessity
of
always
holding
the
cigar
which
in
the
course
of
time
imparts
a
dingy
hue
to
the
fingers
fifthly
the
danger
of
injuring
the
clothes
and
furniture
by
the
constant
falling
of
the
ashes
sixthly
the
eyes
suffer
from
their
proximity
to
the
heated
fumes
and
last
but
not
least
there
is
the
satisfaction
of
imbibing
the
of
some
black
mouth
for
the
black
nymphs
who
are
employed
in
this
manufacture
always
salivate
their
handiwork
by
way
of
giving
it
a
smooth
and
handsome
finish
surely
could
our
amateurs
but
witness
the
manufacture
of
their
favorite
havanas
they
would
forever
eschew
that
form
of
the
aromatic
weed
but
apart
from
all
these
considerations
the
very
convenience
of
the
cigar
becomes
an
objection
for
being
always
at
hand
the
too
frequent
use
of
it
has
converted
the
pleasure
into
an
evil
such
a
constant
craving
being
excited
that
even
the
health
is
injured
doubtless
this
perverted
taste
in
circumstances
where
smoking
has
not
been
permitted
as
on
board
ships
behind
counters
in
offices
has
induced
the
pernicious
practice
of
chewing
those
nations
who
retain
the
original
natural
and
simplest
mode
of
enjoying
the
weed
have
never
relinquished
the
pipe
but
have
varied
the
form
of
this
implement
and
much
beautified
and
improved
it
the
people
who
have
retained
the
use
of
the
pipe
are
the
dutch
irish
english
scotch
germans
russians
turks
persians
and
all
orientals
in
the
perfection
of
the
art
of
smoking
the
persians
may
rank
first
then
the
osmanlis
russians
hungarians
dutch
english
and
last
of
all
the
germans
the
persians
rank
high
in
this
respect
because
they
have
studied
the
philosophy
of
enjoying
the
fumes
of
tobacco
in
their
greatest
purity
this
they
have
attained
by
passing
the
smoke
through
water
and
thus
purifying
it
from
the
essential
oil
of
the
plant
the
kaleon
of
the
persians
the
hookah
of
hindostan
the
shishé
of
the
arabs
or
the
narghillé
of
the
turks
is
an
vessel
partially
filled
with
water
on
the
top
of
which
is
a
bowl
to
contain
the
ignited
tobacco
from
this
bowl
a
tube
descends
into
the
water
and
the
long
and
flexible
pipe
is
inserted
into
the
vessel
above
the
level
of
the
water
when
the
smoker
begins
to
draw
through
the
pipe
a
partial
vacuum
is
created
in
the
vessel
which
occasions
the
pressure
of
the
external
air
to
force
the
smoke
of
the
tobacco
downward
through
the
small
tube
above
mentioned
into
the
water
beneath
where
after
losing
its
solid
particles
it
bubbles
up
into
the
vacant
space
above
and
thence
through
the
pipe
to
the
mouth
of
the
smoker
but
ever
since
the
peculiar
and
agreeable
properties
of
this
fragrant
plant
have
been
known
the
ingenuity
of
its
votaries
has
been
excited
to
invent
and
improve
the
ways
and
means
of
obtaining
the
greatest
amount
of
satisfaction
from
its
use
in
the
earliest
stages
the
pipe
was
made
of
one
entire
piece
of
clay
but
soon
the
fact
was
established
that
this
substance
became
so
heated
as
to
decompose
the
tobacco
metallic
and
other
pipes
were
tried
but
still
the
same
evil
existed
until
wood
became
the
most
popular
material
but
that
being
combustible
the
flavor
of
the
tobacco
was
deteriorated
and
at
last
the
arrangement
was
made
of
a
stem
of
wood
with
a
bowl
of
clay
attached
to
it
to
contain
the
ignited
plant
the
wood
was
a
nonconductor
of
heat
capable
of
being
constructed
of
any
length
and
moreover
easily
cleaned
so
that
this
was
pronounced
the
great
desideratum
the
turks
have
displayed
the
greatest
refinement
and
taste
in
the
manufacture
of
their
long
and
beautiful
chibouks
or
to
which
they
attach
the
amber
so
agreeable
to
the
lips
and
free
from
all
impurities
a
peculiar
species
of
clay
was
discovered
in
turkey
so
remarkably
argillaceous
as
to
supersede
all
other
substances
for
the
construction
of
and
these
oriental
and
philosophic
smokers
have
displayed
their
wisdom
and
science
in
the
peculiar
form
into
which
they
have
molded
them
the
form
of
a
lüllé
or
turkish
is
that
of
an
inverted
cone
the
base
of
which
when
filled
with
tobacco
forms
the
surface
the
design
of
this
form
is
to
present
a
greater
surface
of
exposure
to
the
atmosphere
and
to
bring
a
smaller
body
of
tobacco
in
contact
with
the
bowl
which
is
made
as
thin
and
delicate
as
the
nature
of
the
material
will
permit
so
as
to
possess
the
least
quantity
of
body
and
thus
less
power
of
retaining
heat
the
pipe
should
be
lighted
in
the
centre
of
the
bowl
not
with
a
piece
of
paper
which
would
scorch
the
surface
of
the
tobacco
but
with
a
small
piece
of
spunk
at
each
inhalation
the
ignited
circle
enlarges
and
extends
toward
the
edge
of
the
bowl
and
as
the
combustion
takes
place
proportionally
downward
it
is
evident
that
all
the
tobacco
is
consumed
without
the
assistance
of
fingering
it
as
the
germans
are
in
the
habit
of
doing
the
stem
is
always
of
wood
but
great
care
is
used
in
its
selection
jasmine
is
cultivated
expressly
for
and
carefully
trained
so
as
to
increase
in
length
and
uniform
thickness
are
much
prized
and
more
durable
than
the
jasmine
and
there
is
a
species
of
wild
fruit
tree
called
germeshek
peculiar
to
turkey
remarkably
suited
for
the
use
of
tobacco
and
very
generally
used
these
are
never
less
than
four
or
five
feet
long
and
perfectly
straight
the
object
gained
by
the
length
is
that
the
smoke
arrives
at
the
lips
comparatively
cool
having
deposited
its
more
solid
particles
in
the
stem
which
being
perfectly
straight
is
easily
cleansed
for
it
is
an
essential
point
that
the
pipe
should
contrary
to
german
philosophy
be
kept
pure
still
another
advantage
gained
by
the
length
is
that
the
pipe
may
be
easily
disposed
of
for
the
moment
resting
by
the
side
or
against
a
table
without
deranging
the
tobacco
in
the
bowl
which
should
always
have
a
small
brass
tray
beneath
it
to
protect
the
floor
from
any
accident
certainly
then
a
turkish
chibouk
is
unequalled
as
an
implement
for
smoking
the
pure
amber
mouthpiece
often
glittering
with
brilliants
the
long
stem
one
unbroken
length
of
slender
jasmine
and
the
delicate
and
bowl
seem
to
constitute
the
very
essence
of
refinement
in
the
luxury
of
smoking
and
no
wonder
that
the
osmanlis
recline
for
hours
on
their
silken
cushions
and
puff
and
puff
again
ambrosial
gales
one
reason
of
the
luxury
displayed
in
the
turkish
pipe
is
that
the
chibouk
is
an
indispensable
appendage
of
hospitality
always
presented
to
the
guests
and
constantly
changed
and
replaced
by
another
each
successive
pipe
exceeding
its
predecessor
in
beauty
and
value
until
the
visit
is
terminated
the
chibouks
and
narghillés
are
symbols
of
luxury
and
wealth
among
the
osmanlis
as
services
of
silver
are
appendages
of
elegant
life
to
the
europeans
and
there
is
great
ambition
to
excel
each
other
in
the
costliness
of
their
appurtenances
of
smoking
many
of
the
pashas
and
other
men
of
wealth
possess
chibouks
to
the
value
of
ranging
from
upwards
sultan
mahmoud
was
forced
to
issue
an
edict
forbidding
the
hosts
to
present
them
to
visitors
and
ordering
that
every
one
should
provide
his
own
chibouk
hence
the
appendage
to
all
gentlemen
of
rank
of
a
who
always
accompanies
his
master
the
narghillés
or
hookahs
are
also
very
popular
and
often
of
exquisite
workmanship
but
pipes
being
more
portable
and
handy
are
generally
preferred
the
effort
necessary
to
draw
the
smoke
from
the
narghillé
is
by
some
considered
as
objectionable
but
a
little
practice
soon
habituates
to
its
use
and
certainly
with
this
instrument
we
have
the
smoke
in
its
greatest
purity
but
it
is
not
only
the
utility
and
beauty
of
the
long
chibouk
which
constitute
the
osmanlis
the
best
and
most
philosophical
smokers
there
is
no
tobacco
in
the
world
so
delicious
as
the
turkish
so
varied
in
its
degrees
of
narcotic
strength
or
so
carefully
prepared
and
a
taste
once
being
acquired
for
this
species
of
the
plant
all
other
varieties
become
intolerable
a
growing
taste
for
this
tobacco
has
of
late
been
acquired
in
america
and
the
increasing
demand
for
this
article
has
induced
speculators
to
flood
the
market
with
spurious
imitations
or
adulterations
both
imported
and
of
home
manufacture
even
in
turkey
the
greatest
connoisseurs
can
with
difficulty
procure
the
best
species
there
are
so
many
varieties
offered
for
sale
the
very
worst
kind
of
which
so
much
is
exported
to
america
being
from
smyrna
and
its
immediate
neighborhood
the
tobacco
most
valued
and
justly
so
for
its
pure
and
aromatic
flavor
is
only
raised
in
a
small
district
of
thessaly
in
european
turkey
and
is
called
yenijé
tobacco
from
the
name
of
the
region
where
it
is
cultivated
there
has
been
concocted
a
peculiar
kind
or
brand
of
the
plant
under
the
title
of
scafarlatti
which
seems
to
have
gained
great
celebrity
in
the
united
states
as
being
the
genuine
turkish
article
this
appellation
is
as
yet
unknown
in
turkey
and
must
have
sprung
from
the
inventive
brain
of
some
one
of
the
barnum
race
who
would
even
enlarge
the
turkish
vocabulary
at
the
expense
of
the
lingua
italiana
not
to
notice
the
western
nations
who
with
their
clay
pipes
have
remained
in
statu
quo
in
the
art
of
smoking
the
germans
deserve
some
criticism
for
they
have
made
many
attempts
to
arrive
at
perfection
the
material
of
which
the
german
are
made
poetically
called
meerschaum
is
ill
adapted
for
the
purpose
and
the
forms
of
their
stems
and

of
the
science
of

the
meerschaum
or
froth
of

a
native
rock
formation
of

and
is
excavated
about
two
or
three
hundred
miles
from

of
marmora
every
particle
is
exported
to
vienna
and
it
is
never
used
by
the
natives
because
it
is
a
calcareous
substance
and
when
in
contact
with
fire
undergoes
a
process
of
combustion
to
a
sufficient
degree
to
decompose
the
tobacco
this
fact
is
well
attested
by
the
circumstance
that
a
meerschaum
is
greatly
enhanced
in
value
when
by
a
long
and
tedious
process
it
has
lost
all
its
combustible
properties
and
is
thus
rendered
incapable
of
deteriorating
the
tobacco
but
why
select
a
substance
which
requires
so
long
an
apprenticeship
when
nature
furnishes
one
well
suited
for
the
purpose
and
why
esteem
an
article
for
its
power
of
absorption
and
then
prize
it
the
more
for
having
lost
it
by
time
and
use
german
philosophy
only
can
explain
apart
from
the
unfitness
of
meerschaum
for
the
bowl
the
form
in
which
it
is
modelled
shows
how
little
the
nature
of
tobacco
is
understood
by
those
sturdy
people
for
the
form
of
an
elongated
cylinder
only
serves
to
surround
the
weed
by
a
heavy
body
of
combustible
material
capable
of
containing
an
excessive
degree
of
heat
and
thus
decomposing
the
tobacco
but
the
main
object
of
these
amateurs
of
the
seems
to
be
to
deteriorate
the
fume
of
the
narcotic
plant
as
much
as
possible
for
to
cap
the
climax
of
their
absurdity
a
metallic
cover
is
nicely
fitted
to
those
exquisite
and
thus
the
favorite
meerschaum
is
converted
into
a
perfect
retort
for
the
manufacture
of
their
stems
are
generally
made
of
the
most
ordinary
wood
short
and
curving
and
the
of
the
minutest
dimensions
the
object
in
having
such
small
is
to
imitate
the
process
by
which
infants
are
nourished
by
introducing
them
into
the
mouth
and
regularly
sucking
up
the
smoke
instead
of
inhaling
it
as
the
osmanlis
do
by
merely
resting
their
lips
upon
the
large
and
oval
surface
of
the
amber
the
introduction
of
the
piece
into
the
mouth
immediately
excites
the
saliva
which
in
part
passes
into
the
pipe
and
is
otherwise
discharged
by
spitting
a
most
disgusting
practice
unknown
among
the
orientals
notwithstanding
also
the
shortness
of
the
pipe
owing
to
its
curved
form
and
the
diminutive
mouthpiece
it
is
almost
impossible
to
keep
it
clean
but
it
seems
to
be
a
sort
of
german
philosophy
not
only
to
have
their
pipes
in
a
most
filthy
state
but
to
delight
in
and
value
them
the
more
in
proportion
to
their
antiquity
and
impurity
truly
there
is
no
accounting
for
taste
nor
is
it
any
longer
a
matter
of
wonder
that
pigs
delight
to
wallow
in
the
mire
if
then
the
nations
of
the
east
the
persians
and
osmanlis
are
behind
the
age
in
other
matters
of
civilization
they
have
surely
attained
the
acme
of
refinement
in
this
delight
nature
too
has
favored
them
in
the
peculiar
quality
of
their
tobacco
and
the
very
indolence
of
their
habits
has
led
them
to
meditate
more
diligently
on
their
favorite
luxury
hence
the
palm
in
this
matter
is
to
be
given
to
their
musical
gurgling
narghillé
purifying
and
cooling
the
fragrant
fumes
and
to
the
long
and
graceful
chibouk
which
a
little
care
will
keep
always
pure
and
ready
for
use
these
are
well
worth
the
adaptation
of
other
nations
some
have
however
objected
to
the
chibouk
as
not
being
portable
and
convenient
during
a
promenade
as
if
there
were
a
municipal
law
requiring
all
good
citizens
to
smoke
in
the
streets
if
the
good
taste
of
the
community
should
render
the
use
of
these
chibouks
and
narghillés
popular
there
is
no
doubt
that
all
the
places
for
public
refreshment
would
be
provided
with
them
as
they
now
are
in
turkey
and
all
over
the
east
the
coffee
plant
is
well
known
to
be
a
native
of
arabia
it
was
used
as
a
drink
in
that
part
of
the
world
as
early
as
the
ninth
century
of
the
hegira
and
was
gradually
introduced
into
the
countries
of
the
levant
it
was
many
times
declared
unlawful
by
the
followers
of
the
koran
as
being
of
the
class
of
inebriating
liquors
so
often
condemned
by
mohammed
but
the
eastern
nations
are
so
addicted
to
its
use
that
they
say
a
cup
of
coffee
and
a
pipe
of
tobacco
are
a
complete
entertainment
it
seems
that
this
beverage
was
made
fashionable
in
paris
about
the
year
by
a
turkish
ambassador
the
elegance
of
the
equipage
recommended
it
to
the
eye
and
charmed
the
women
the
brilliant
porcelain
cups
in
which
it
was
poured
the
napkins
fringed
with
gold
and
the
turkish
slaves
on
their
knees
presenting
it
to
the
ladies
seated
on
the
ground
on
cushions
turned
the
heads
of
the
parisian
dames
this
elegant
introduction
made
the
exotic
beverage
a
subject
of
conversation
and
in
an
armenian
at
paris
at
the
fair
time
opened
a
coffee
house
this
establishment
was
much
frequented
by
the
literati
until
the
proprietor
added
the
sale
of
wine
and
beer
to
its
attractions
a
similar
attempt
was
made
in
new
york
in
but
soon
relinquished
notwithstanding
the
proverbial
fondness
of
the
americans
for
good
coffee
and
tobacco
the
fact
is
their
temperament
is
too
nervous
and
their
habits
are
too
restless
to
allow
them
quietly
to
sip
their
coffee
and
smoke
their
pipes
as
the
orientals
do
besides
the
style
of
preparing
the
coffee
in
turkey
is
decidedly
superior
to
any
known
in
europe
or
america
and
has
met
with
the
approbation
of
those
who
have
tasted
it
either
in
new
york
or
in
the
sultan
dominions
coffee
is
found
on
chemical
analysis
to
contain
a
highly
nutritious
element
known
as
caffein
this
component
part
of
all
good
coffee
is
found
to
contain
a
larger
proportion
of
nitrogen
than
any
other
vegetable
principle
and
in
this
respect
equals
some
of
the
most
highly
animalized
products
rendering
it
nutritious
as
a
drink
the
essential
oil
of
the
berry
is
so
volatile
that
the
greatest
care
and
skill
are
requisite
in
its
roasting
and
pulverization
for
if
too
much
burnt
the
aroma
is
destroyed
if
underdone
the
water
fails
to
absorb
or
extract
the
nutritious
material
and
if
not
properly
pulverized
a
perfect
chemical
combination
of
the
particles
in
solution
is
not
effected
there
is
no
doubt
a
desire
among
the
americans
to
obtain
this
beverage
in
its
purity
and
excellence
as
evince
the
many
machines
and
contrivances
they
use
yet
they
seldom
if
ever
succeed
in
their
attempts
the
mixture
from
the
grocers
and
the
ingredients
they
mingle
at
home
such
as
eggs
isinglass
render
it
impossible
to
secure
a
pure
unadulterated
fragrant
solution
of
this
berry
the
commercial
competition
is
so
great
that
in
order
to
be
able
to
undersell
each
other
all
sorts
of
cheaper
substitutes
are
mixed
with
the
coffee
such
as
chicory
beans
peas
etc
thus
annihilating
the
really
nutritive
properties
of
the
genuine
plant
in
a
word
those
who
have
never
tasted
a
cup
of
good
turkish
coffee
are
yet
in
unhappy
ignorance
of
the
peculiar
aroma
and
deliciousness
of
coffee
as
a
beverage
coffee
being
the
universal
and
favorite
beverage
in
turkey
the
first
ideas
of
an
osmanli
upon
opening
his
eyes
in
the
morning
are
associated
with
his
kahvé
and
chibouk
or
coffee
and
pipe
which
in
reality
constitute
his
only
breakfast
and
are
not
only
used
upon
rising
but
at
all
hours
during
the
day
and
at
the
very
moment
of
his
retiring
these
luxuries
are
invariably
offered
to
visitors
and
their
omission
is
regarded
as
a
breach
of
hospitality
their
universal
use
has
given
rise
to
the
establishment
of
numerous
kahvés
which
are
the
resort
of
persons
of
all
ranks
and
condition
they
are
to
be
met
with
in
all
parts
and
quarters
of
the
city
each
having
its
own
set
of
customers
and
constituting
in
reality
the
only
casinos
or
club
houses
where
politics
are
discussed
business
transacted
and
the
news
of
the
day
freely
circulated
in
fact
the
only
bourse
or
exchange
in
constantinople
was
a
coffee
house
at
in
galata
and
it
is
only
of
late
years
that
a
regular
exchange
has
been
erected
many
of
these
kahvés
are
very
beautifully
constructed
and
adorned
with
pillars
and
fountains
with
gardens
attached
to
them
where
visitors
are
entertained
with
sweet
strains
of
music
and
crowds
assemble
to
listen
to
the
extravagant
fictions
of
the
meddahs
or
professed
or
otherwise
to
wile
away
the
time
smoking
sipping
the
fragrant
berry
and
playing
backgammon
dama
or
mangala
all
games
of
chance
are
played
by
the
osmanlis
only
for
amusement
and
gambling
is
not
generally
practised
by
them
the
moral
effect
of
these
establishments
upon
the
community
is
very
evident
for
though
wine
is
forbidden
by
the
koran
there
are
many
or
to
be
found
in
turkey
which
are
not
generally
frequented
by
people
of
any
pretensions
to
respectability
indeed
drunkenness
is
a
very
uncommon
vice
doubtless
owing
to
the
numerous
kahvés
which
afford
the
habitual
refreshments
of
pipes
and
coffee
to
the
people
with
every
facility
for
social
intercourse
on
entering
the
coffee
shop
there
is
an
elevated
platform
on
the
three

which
is
furnished
with
cushions
or
mats
for
the

on
the
sides
of

are
various
grotesque
pictures
and
also
shelves
where
the
implements
of

and

are
so
fantastically
displayed
as
to
create
a
somewhat
comic
appearance
and
one
altogether
peculiar
to
turkey
at
one
of
the
remotest
corners
is
an
elevated
for
the
preparation
of
coffee
which
is
served
in
very
small
cups
the
diminutive
quantity
of
this
beverage
was
so
unsatisfactory
to
one
of
the
sailors
of
the
english
fleet
at
constantinople
that

tasting
it
he
observed

and
pleasing
to
the
eye
but
the
most
active
and
busy
personage
in
this
establishment
is
the
berber
or
barber
who
is
not
only
the
shaver
and
trimmer
in
general
but
extends
the
province
of
his
sharp
profession
to
bleeding

avocations
are

always
follow
in

and
even
precede

for
bleeding
is
a
universal
remedy
in

whether
the
patient
is
sick
of
fever
or
fright
indeed
it
is
the
custom
for
every
body
to
be
bled

in
the

in
order
to
purify
the
system
add
to
this
the
frequent
application
of
leeches
scarifications
and
cupping
and
it
may
be
easily
conceived
that
this
branch
of
industry
is
very
profitable
still
more
so
when
it
was
the
custom
to
shave
the
whole
head
for
the
convenience
of
frequent
ablutions
many
in
conformity
with

civilization
now
allow

hamam
or
bath
in
the
east
there
is
one
source
of
comfort
and
enjoyment
which
is
more
essential
than
all
else
and
that
is
the
use
of
the
bath
which
follows
all
other
pleasures
when
excess
has
wearied
the
system
and
precedes
and
prepares
for
anticipated
luxuries
physical
or
mental
this
process
of
purifying
and
refreshing
the
body
is
eagerly
sought
for
as
soon
as
the
traveller
arrives
at
constantinople
indeed
seems
to
be
second
only
in
his
mind
to
the
impressions
of
an
entrance
to
the
magnificent
harbor
the
baths
of
classic
memory
where
the
heroes
of
ancient
rome
were
wont
to
prepare
their
sinews
for
the
athletic
games
and
where
the
patrician
dames
of
pompeii
resorted
to
add
fresher
and
more
glowing
tints
to
their
fair
charms
were
all
conducted
on
the
same
principle
as
those
of
stamboul
at
the
present
day
it
is
wonderful
that
modern
civilization
should
not
yet
have
adopted
the
refinements
of
olden
times
when
they
are
so
essential
to
real
health
and
comfort
as
by
some
mishap
this
desideratum
exists
it
would
not
be
to
describe
the
real
charm
and
merit
of
these
institutions
the
object
of
all
bathing
is
to
free
the
skin
from
the
deposits
of
insensible
perspiration
this
idea
has
been
much
in
vogue
of
late
as
testify
the
medicated
sulphurated
being
in
reality
rather
vehicles
for
disease
than
remedies
but
the
peculiar
substance
which
closes
up
the
pores
of
the
skin
can
not
be
removed
by
simple
immersion
in
soap
and
water
for
like
all
other
greasy
substances
it
is
composed
of
solid
and
liquid
or
stearine
and
olein
the
liquid
part
of
which
may
in
a
chemical
combination
be
absorbed
by
the
water
but
the
skin
will
still
remain
clogged
up
seeing
the
futility
of
the
process
of
immersion
many
have
supposed
that
a
profuse
perspiration
excited
by
fumigation
vaporization
would
carry
off
these
deposits
by
which
processes
however
the
liquid
portion
only
would
be
removed
and
the
system
reduced
to
a
state
of
perfect
exhaustion
the
turkish
baths
are
neither
immersion
nor
vapor
baths
but
the
atmosphere
is
heated
by
means
of
flues
through
the
walls
to
a
temperature
suited
to
induce
a
free
perspiration
without

is
so
arranged
that
the
bather
in

to
another
gradually
becomes
acclimated
to
the

these
baths
unlike
many
other
institutions
in
the
east
are
perfectly
accessible
to
all
both
natives
and
foreigners
and
are
the
more
attractive
on
account
of
their
entire
dissimilarity
from
all
establishments
for
the
same
purpose
in
europe
or
america
frequent
ablutions
and
the
greatest
personal
cleanliness
being
strictly
enjoined
upon
all
true
believers
by
the
precepts
of
the
koran
it
is
considered
an
act
of
piety
to
erect
edifices
and
public
fountains
for
those
purposes
either
during
or
by
personal
bequest
consequently
such
instances
of
benevolence
are
by
no
means
rare
nor
are
the
structures
deficient
in
architectural
beauty
they
are
built
of
stone
and
adorned
with
cupolas
besprinkled
with
globular
glasses
which
transmit
a
softened
light
to
the
interior
the
interior
is
divided
into
three
compartments
the
saloon
the
tepidarium
and
the
bath
itself
the
saloon
where
the
visitors
dress
and
undress
is
a
large
apartment
surrounded
on
three
sides
by
elevated
platforms
on
which
are
placed
mattresses
and
cushions
for
the
comfort
and
accommodation
of
those
who
frequent
the
bath
in
the
centre
of
this
room
there
is
usually
a
marble
fountain
whose
trickling
waters
soothe
the
ear
and
add
beauty
to
the
scene
dispensing
a
delicious
coolness
to
the
atmosphere
on
his
entrance
to
this
saloon
the
visitor
is
immediately
greeted
with
bouyourun
you
are
welcome
from
the
attendants
who
conduct
him
to
one
of
the
mattresses
on
the
platform
where
he
is
undressed
within

temporary
screen
made
by
holding

sensitively
modest
and
feel
a
feminine
delicacy
in
this
respect
so
that
none
ever

in
public
without
being
suitably
invested
his
watch
ring
and
purse
are
handed
over
to
the
hamamgy
for

keeping
and
his
apparel

carefully
folded
in
a
shawl
and
designated
by
his
own
which
is
placed
upon
it
is
deposited
by
the
side
of
the
mattress
now
appropriated
to
his
exclusive
use
notwithstanding
all
these
precautions
very
ludicrous
mistakes
sometimes
occur
as
happened
recently
to
a
certain
soldier
who
was
anxious
to
abandon
the
ranks
and
possessing
no
other
means
of
changing
his
uniform
for
a
citizen
dress
entered
the
bath
en
militaire
where
after
having
performed
his
ablutions
he
committed
the
very
slight
error
of
appropriating
to
himself
a
neighbor
mattress
with
its
accompanying
wardrobe
and
thus
was
enabled
to
make
an
honorable
retreat
en
bourgeois
being
now
undressed
enveloped
in
large
towels
and
mounted
on
nalluns
or
wooden
pattens
to
protect
his
feet
from
the
hot
marble
and
the
water
the
bather
is
conducted
into
the
halvet
or
tepidarium
which
is
heated
to
a
degree
a
little
above
temperate
where
he
reposes
on
cushions
until
he
is
gradually
acclimated
to
the
atmosphere
when
the
pores
of
the
skin
are
opened
and
perspiration
excited
the
visitor
proceeds
to
the
inner
room
to
go
through
the
process
of
bathing
the
hamam
or
bath
itself
whose
temperature
is
raised
to
any
requisite
degree
by
means
of
flues
constructed
within
and
all
along
the
walls
so
as
to
allow
the
flames
to
circulate
freely
in
every
direction
is
in
many
of
these
establishments
exceedingly
beautiful
the
dome
being
supported
on
magnificent
columns
and
the
walls
and
doors
inlaid
with
large
slabs
of
marble
and
adorned
with
finely
chiselled
fonts
on
all
sides
which
are
furnished
with
double
ornamented
brass
cocks
for
the
supply
of
warm
and
cold
water
there
is
an
elevated
marble
platform
in
the
middle
where
the
bathers
lie
at
full
length
for
the
purpose
of
having
their
sinews
relaxed
and
joints
examined
both
the
apartment
and
this
process
in
particular
have
been
most
ridiculously
described
and
either
through
malice
or
ignorance
most
egregiously
exaggerated
by
travellers
for
example
the
public
are
informed
that
a
dense
vapor
sometimes
so
fills
the
saloon
that
he
the
bather
sees
nothing
distinctly
but
figures
flit
before
him
like
visions
in
a
mist
having
walked
or
sat
in
this
heated
mist
till
a
profuse
perspiration
bursts
out
the
tellak
again
approaches
and
commences
his
operations
he
lays
the
bather
on
his
back
or
face
and
pins
him
to
the
ground
by
kneeling
heavily
on
him
and
having
thus
secured
him
he
handles
him
in
the
rudest
and
most
painful
manner
he
twists
and
turns
the
limbs
so
as
to
seem
to
dislocate
every
joint
the
sufferer
feels
as
if
the
very
spine
was
separated
and
the
vertebræ
of
the
back
torn
asunder
it
is
in
vain
he
complains
of
this
treatment
screams
out
in
anguish
and
apprehension
and
struggles
to
extricate
himself
the
incubus
sits
grinning
upon
him
and
torturing
him
till
he
becomes
passive
from
very
exhaustion
in
the
first
place
there
is
no
dense
vapor
in
a
turkish
bath
but
the
heat
is
produced
by
the
flues
in
the
walls
true
there
is
sometimes
the
appearance
of
mist
which
is
only
created
momentarily
by
the
quantity
of
hot
water
poured
over
the
bathers
and
is
soon
dispersed
by
ventilation
for
such
an
atmosphere
is
never
tolerated
by
the
natives
now
as
to
the
bather
being
pinned
to
the
ground
in
the
rudest
and
most
painful
manner
there
is
more
of
a
spirit
of
ridicule
than
simple
truth
in
this
description
it
being
only
resorted
to
in
cases
of
rheumatism
and
the
like
maladies
when
the
patient
is
extended
on
the
marble
platform
and
all
his
joints
examined
and
rubbed
by
the
tellak
or
assistant
who
owing
to
the
relaxed
condition
of
the
nervous
system
easily
discovers
the
seat
of
any
local
pain
and
proceeds
to
dispel
it
by
friction
many
having
experienced
decided
relief
from
this
mode
of
treatment
it
is
very
frequently
resorted
to
in
turkey
no
such
treatment
therefore
ever
occurs
on
ordinary
occasions
unless
the
farce
is
got
up
by
special
request
and
for
the
benefit
of
strangers
or
travellers
who
not
content
with
the
usual
modus
operandi
insist
upon
the
realization
of
their
own
extravagant
ideas
a
native
of
constantinople
had
to
stop
at
smyrna
on
his
way
to
america
being
anxious
to
enjoy
the
luxury
of
a
bath
once
more
he
repaired
to
one
of
the
establishments
as
he
wore
a
hat
the
attendants
mistook
him
for
a
regular
frank
or
european
and
he
resolved
to
maintain
the
joke
by
pretending
utter
ignorance
of
all
the
languages
of
the
country
after
having
experienced
many
absurdities
all
novel
to
a
native
he
was
at
last
stretched
full
length
upon
his
stomach
on
the
marble
platform
of
the
bath
the
tellak
kneeling
by
his
side
commenced
a
regular
process
of
pommelling
him
and
at
the
same
time
of
cracking
his
joints
the
incubus
as
though
not
satisfied
with
his
own
exertions
now
called
for
assistance
from
another
tellak
who
came
and
placed
himself
on
the
opposite
side
when
both
commenced
in
the
rudest
manner
to
push
their
victim
from
one
to
the
other
the
sufferer
astonished
at
this
extraordinary
treatment
was
ready
to
split
his
sides
with
laughter
which
one
of
the
tellaks
taking
as
an
indication
of
uneasiness
observed
to
the
other
not
to
be
so
rude
in
his
manipulations
he
was
in
return
assured
this
is
the
way
the
franks
like
the
harder
the
better
also
they
must
not
be
allowed
to
think
they
have
had
their
money
worth
doubtless
an
osmanli
would
not
only
be
much
amused
but
astonished
could
he
behold
the
victim
of
a
european
vapor
bath
as
he
sits
boxed
up
and
enveloped
in
blankets
to
his
throat
parboiled
with
steam
and
suffocated
by
the
fumes
of
brimstone
surely
he
would
believe
he
had
by
mistake
got
into
the
regions
of
eblis
when
the
person
is
in
a
state
of
free
perspiration
he
is
seated
by
the
side
of
one
of
the
fountains
beneath
which
are
marble
basins
to
receive
the
water
both
hot
and
cold
as
it
flows
from
the
ornamented
cocks
for
no
osmanli
ever
uses
the
tub
water
which
has
once
been
in
contact
with
the
body
having
imbibed
its
impurities
is
deemed
unfit
for
further
use
therefore
on
all
occasions
their
ablutions
are
performed
with
flowing
water
for
they
do
not
delight
to
wallow
and
splash
in
a
solution
of
their
own
dirt
the
tellak
having
upon
his
right
hand
a
kesse
or
bag
made
of
raw
silk
commences
a
gentle
rubbing
for
they
can
not
bear
any
rude
or
rough
treatment
for
which
reason
the
delicate
hands
of
boys
are
employed
over
the
surface
of
the
body
by
which
the
deposits
of
insensible
perspiration
are
disengaged
from
the
pores
of
the
skin
and
combining
together
fall
from
the
person
like
fibres
of
paste
which
to
the
uninitiated
might
seem
like
the
peeling
off
of
the
outer
pellicle
itself
in
this
process
consists
the
real
virtue
of
a
hamam
and
to
it
alone
is
to
be
attributed
the
peculiar
softness
of
the
skin
of
an
oriental
which
even
gives
them
an
air
of
effeminacy
immediately
after
the
process
of
shampooing
or
rubbing
the
marble
font
having
been
filled
with
water
of
the
desired
temperature
it
is
poured
over
the
person
of
the
bather
from
the
brass
tass
or
bowl
used
for
the
purpose
by
the
attendant
the
person
is
now
thoroughly
washed
with
perfumed
soap
again
water
is
poured
over
him
in
abundance
and
he
is
finally
enveloped
in
the
havlous
or
large
napped
towels
manufactured
in
the
country
expressly
for
the
purpose
and
admirably
adapted
to
absorb
moisture
now
perfectly
purified
with
a
sensation
of
languor
the
bather
proceeds
to
the
dressing
saloon
where
as
he
reclines
upon
luxurious
cushions
his
whole
being
seems
momentarily
lost
in
that
dreamy
repose
of
existence
which
is
the
true
kief
of
an
oriental
he
is
only
awakened
to
real
life
by
the
assiduities
of
his
attendants
some
gently
fanning
him
and
others
presenting
sherbet
coffee
pipes
etc
the
fatigue
and
languor
gradually
pass
away
as
with
a
sensation
of
renovated
existence
he
reposes
until
the
heat
of
his
body
is
reduced
to
its
natural
temperature
his
toilette
being
completed
he
surveys
himself
in
a
small
enamelled
mirror
which
is
offered
to
him
and
after
depositing
upon
it
the
amount
of
money
compatible
with
his
own
station
in
life
he
quits
the
precincts
of
this
luxurious
establishment
light
joyful
and
contented
the
hamams
being
altogether
charitable
institutions
there
is
no
fixed
price
demanded
from
visitors
for
the
use
of
the
bath
itself
it
being
entirely
left
to
their
own
option
but
the
personal
services
of
the
attendants
and
the
wear
and
tear
of
the
splendid
bathing
paraphernalia
not
being
included
in
the
same
category
an
adequate
remuneration
is
of
course
expected
this
also
is
left
to
individual
generosity
in
ordinary
cases
from
half
to
three
quarters
of
a
dollar
is
sufficient
but
there
may
be
no
limit
to
a
person
munificence
nor
to
the
attentions
bestowed
upon
him
a
gentleman
of
rank
once
visited
a
bath
where
he
was
an
entire
stranger
and
although
he
was
not
treated
with
even
ordinary
politeness
he
left
on
his
departure
a
sum
of
money
far
beyond
the
expectations
of
the
attendants
which
opening
their
eyes
forced
them
to
make
a
thousand
apologies
for
their
remissness
and
protestations
for
the
future
the
gentleman
soon
after
gave
them
an
opportunity
to
retrieve
their
former
errors
and
contrary
to
their
excited
hopes
rewarded
them
with
a
couple
of
piasters
about
cents
observing
this
is
what
you
merited
on
my
first
visit
and
what
you
then
received
is
the
equivalent
for
your
present
services
the
money
collected
at
the
bath
is
divided
into
two
portions
one
of
which
is
for
the
hamamgy
or
proprietor
and
the
other
is
shared
among
the
attendants
many
of
the
public
bathing
houses
are
divided
into
two
parts
one
for
men
and
the
other
for
women
and
when
the
establishment
is
not
a
double
one
fridays
and
sundays
only
are
reserved
for
men
and
the
rest
of
the
week
allotted
to
the
ladies
there
are
always
exquisite
specimens
of
these
hamams
attached
to
the
houses
of
the
wealthy
and
their
friends
and
neighbors
are
often
invited
to
partake
with
them
of
this
amusement
as
the
osmanli
ladies
very
seldom
enjoy
the
excitement
and
bustle
of
a
crowd
they
consider
the
occasion
of
going
to
bathe
as
one
of
the
greatest
festivity
and
they
always
carry
with
them
every
article
necessary
for
comfort
or
luxury
the
hamamgy
not
furnishing
mattresses
towels
as
in
the
case
of
the
gentlemen
besides
the
opportunity
of
displaying
embroidered
cushions
napkins
they
find
rare
and
ample
amusement
in
the
discussion
of
scandal
moral
and
political
as
well
as
general
domestic
gossip
the
tout
ensemble
of
a
lady
bath
is
one
altogether
peculiar
and
of
course
more
enchanting
to
the
eye
than
the
ablutions
of
their
lords
and
masters
the
following
description
of
a
visit
to
a
bath
by
a
lady
long
a
resident
in
constantinople
may
be
interesting
as
the
result
of
personal
observation
and
experience
my
first
turkish
bath
shall
i
describe
it
dear
we
were
a
large
party
the
mother
her
three
daughters
three
maids
and
my
humble
self
you
would
have
supposed
we
were
arranging
our
wardrobes
for
a
long
season
of
travel
except
that
the
garments
would
be
rather
unpresentable
on
ordinary
occasions
very
peculiar
nappy
towels
large
as
sheets
issued
forth
from
their
repose
in
the
vast
closets
white
and
colored
embroidered
and
fringed
of
the
same
style
yellow
woollen
mittens
to
rub
with
they
told
me
innumerable
shining
bowls
tremendous
clogs
for
the
feet
great
bars
of
soap
precious
packages
of
dyes
paints
capillary
antidotes
perfumes
essences
mirrors
in
embroidered
frames
and
a
thousand
other
etceteras
of
oriental
toilette
in
due
order
entered
the
vast
bundles
which
were
in
preparation
next
appeared
a
beautiful
rug
or
carpet
a
rich
silken
mattress
and
cushions
and
a
large
piece
of
crimson
woollen
shaggy
material
to
envelope
the
cushions
such
as
i
have
frequently
seen
spread
in
the
beautiful
cayiks
really
one
would
have
supposed
we
were
to
be
deposited
in
some
unfurnished
dwelling
with
all
this
paraphernalia
then
came
the
private
wardrobe
of
each
individual
neatly
folded
in
a
separate
envelope
and
last
but
not
least
the
most
refreshing
array
of
fruit
sherbets
and
a
curious
machine
some
five
stories
high
in
whose
different
compartments
were
packed
various
specimens
of
turkish
cookery
i
began
to
wonder
if
we
were
ever
to
return
from
this
bathing
so
vast
were
the
preparations
but
every
one
was
gay
and
nothing
was
tiresome
besides
we
always
go
to
bathe
in
this
style
at
least
once
a
month
our
carriage
waited
at
the
door
a
grand
spacious
one
covered
with
crimson
shag
the
ends
trimmed
with
deep
fringes
of
gold
no
seats
but
plenty
of
cushions
and
two
oxen
were
our
steeds
having
duly
veiled
ourselves
that
our
or
charms
might
not
be
displayed
to
the
eyes
of
the
unprivileged
we
ascended
the
steps
at
the
end
of
our
araba
and
were
seated
according
to
our
respective
ranks
the
old
lady
and
myself
occupying
the
honorable
places
in
the
front
just
behind
the
tails
of
the
oxen
which
were
fortunately
looped
up
so
that
they
could
neither
switch
us
nor
themselves
there
is
a
decided
advantage
in
this
seat
the
view
being
unobstructed
by
any
coachman
as
that
dignitary
always
walks
before
the
head
of
the
animals
next
to
us
were
the
three
hanums
behind
whom
were
the
maids
and
bundles
and
the
large
pannier
was
slung
underneath
full
of
its
creature
comforts
i
felt
as
if
i
had
suddenly
been
transformed
into
a
houri
as
they
all
declared
that
the
yashmak
converted
me
into
a
real
circassian
beauty
in
due
time
we
arrived
and
descended
from
our
airy
vehicle
as
we
entered
the
outer
hall
of
the
bath
each
one
made
a
polite
temennah
to
the
or
the
lady
proprietress
who
was
squatting
on
her
cushions
in
a
corner
this
salutation
she
returned
to
all
genuine
turkish
ladies
myself
included
with
the
same
polite
gesture
but
the
unfortunate
giavours
only
received
a
slight
nod
no
matter
how
profound
their
selams
it
is
well
to
be
queen
somewhere
even
of
a
bathing
establishment
the
maids
eleny
maria
and
sophy
spread
out
our
cushions
in
one
of
the
niches
upon
the
elevated
platform
and
as
they
modestly
held
up
a
towel
as
a
screen
we
proceeded
to
reduce
ourselves
to
a
state
of
nature
enveloped
from
head
to
feet
in
our
bathing
habiliments
which
hung
about
us
in
just
such
folds
as
they
drape
the
statues
we
willingly
thrust
our
pedestrial
extremities
into
the
great
clogs
inlaid
with
mother
of
pearl
entered
the
antechamber
of
the
bath
and
sat
down
on
the
marble
platform
to
acclimate
ourselves
here
we
take
a
coup
of
the
strange
scene
old
women
without
any
charms
to
conceal
spare
themselves
the
effort
and
multitudes
of
naked
cherubs
patter
about
yonder
sits
a
victim
to
paints
and
dyes
her
hair
now
white
suddenly
becomes
beautifully
black
and
the
colour
streaming
over
her
body
bedecks
her
for
the
moment
à
but
that
was
all
washed
off
and
they
proceeded
to
rub
a
sort
of
mud
all
over
her
body
to
take
out
the
pains
then
she
underwent
a
process
of
pommelling
as
she
was
stretched
out
on
the
marble
floor
poor
thing
she
had
both
rheumatism
and
grey
hairs
and
was
a
fit
subject
for
the
most
special
and
extra
efforts
of
the
attendants
of
the
bath
but
the
children
such
victims
of
all
ages
from
one
month
upwards
were
screaming
to
the
highest
pitch
of
their
little
voices
as
they
were
unmercifully
rubbed
and
lathered
from
the
crown
of
their
heads
to
the
soles
of
their
feet
up
and
smooth
down
seemed
to
be
no
part
of
the
nursery
creed
of
their
unmerciful
mothers
but
rough
all
ways
amid
these
infantile
yells
and
agonies
the
girls
young
and
pretty
walked
up
and
down
pattering
with
their
clogs
and
chanting
their
wild
native
melodies
as
if
to
put
out
all
other
noises
and
the
great
marble
halls
did
their
best
to
all
these
floating
sounds
was
i
in
paradise
or
pandemonium
were
these
peris
or
demons
i
could
not
tell
everything
was
so
bewildering
i
was
duly
rubbed
and
washed
like
the
rest
then
it
was
proposed
to
take
lunch
our
party
en
déshabillé
which
means
crimson
faces
and
napkin
drapery
with
long
and
dripping
hair
sea
nymphs
maids
of
the
mist
seated
themselves
on
the
marble
platform
in
the
cooler
room
and
the
large
round
tray
made
its
appearance
how
delicious
the
iced
sherbet
the
little
balls
of
rice
covered
with
delicate
vine
leaves
the
artichokes
à
the
kebab
the
helva
in
a
word
spite
of
the
strange
table
strange
costume
and
general
humidity
we
all
had
tremendous
appetites
then
came
a
chibouk
to
the
old
lady
little
cigarettes
to
the
young
maidens
a
delicious
cup
of
coffee
and
we
all
raised
our
voices
in
a
sweet
turkish
song
about
loves
jessamines
güle
and
bülbüls
being
thus
recruited
we
were
able
to
undergo
the
last
ablutions
and
with
a
complete
investment
of
pure
white
and
delicately
perfumed
towels
we
proceeded
to
our
first
niche
in
the
great
and
laid
us
down
to
dream
or
listlessly
to
watch
the
innumerable
toilettes
of
the
devotees
to
venus
and
love
some
all
fair
and
rosy
were
reclining
luxuriously
like
ourselves
enveloped
in
fine
white
drapery
richly
embroidered
and
fringed
with
gold
while
their
beautiful
slaves
whose
charming
figures
were
not
so
carefully
concealed
were
combing
braiding
and
perfuming
the
long
silken
tresses
of
the
fair
hanums
after
we
had
amused
ourselves
at
the
indifference
of
the
really
beautiful
and
the
minute
and
strenuous
efforts
of
others
to
appear
so
we
again
sipped
our
coffee
and
completed
our
toilette
ready
at
any
time
to
spend
another
day
in
such
delightful
aquatic
luxuries
i
could
not
help
contrasting
my
sensations
with
those
i
had
often
felt
on
leaving
one
of
the
bathing
establishments
in
my
own
country
there
a
solitary
closet
a
tub
from
which
perhaps
some
dirty
wench
had
just
emerged
a
hook
or
two
a
dirty
flesh
brush
for
general
service
etc
true
the
warm
water
was
agreeable
and
for
the
moment
caused
an
oblivion
of
all
antecedents
the
hook
convenient
and
the
brush
need
not
be
used
after
an
immersion
of
perhaps
half
an
hour
you
hurry
on
your
apparel
and
hurry
home
all
à
but
here
in
this
turkish
bath
how
imperceptibly
a
whole
day
had
passed
away
how
entertaining
the
scene
how
beautiful
the
fair
handmaidens
of
nature
so
soft
and
pure
after
their
watery
festivities
their
skin
so
white
their
lips
so
red
the
delicate
rosy
tinge
of
their
cheeks
so
tempting
even
old
age
seemed
to
bloom
again
while
a
universal
exhilaration
took
possession
of
us
all
a
delicate
tissue
of
softness
seemed
to
envelop
my
body
and
a
wonderful
feeling
of
amiability
and
love
for
all
the
race
of
human
kind
glowed
within
my
breast
every
motion
gave
me
pleasure
and
i
could
scarce
recognize
myself
alas
for
american
ladies
they
can
never
feel
the
true
oriental
kief
in
bathing
for
they
have
no
cushions
to
repose
upon
no
softly
murmuring
fountains
to
lull
their
senses
nor
any
such
relaxation
from
all
external
and
internal
woes
as
follows
a
turkish
bath
in
vain
they
tinge
their
complexions
powder
and
wash
they
can
not
attain
this
to
kalon
of
beauty
nor
be
electrified
by
this
wand
of
enchantment
which
renders
the
humblest
cinderella
of
the
orient
lovely
as
a
princess
and
says
avaunt
to
all
the
modern
mysteries
of

chapter
xxxv
the
rayas
or
subjects
the
armenians
the
whole
population
of
turkey
may
be
estimated
at
over
of
souls
including
the
principalities
and
other
tributary
states
which
if
deducted
leaves
in
turkey
proper
half
of
whom
are
mohammedans
and
the
rest
christians
and
jews
the
christians
are
of
various
denominations
each
denomination
constituting
a
separate
community
governed
by
their
own
municipal
regulations
and
guided
by
their
respective
spiritual
heads
hitherto
the
europeans
have
regarded
the
greeks
as
the
predominating
christian
population
of
the
east
the
truth
is
among
the
different
communities
the
armenians
stand
most
prominent
because
not
only
next
to
the
bulgarians
they
rank
high
in
numbers
but
in
reality
supersede
all
others
politically
and
morally
in
their
relations
with
turkey
although
the
bosnians
bulgarians
and
the
greeks
profess
the
same
religion
they
do
not
surrender
their
respective
nationalities
the
greeks
themselves
are
not
therefore
so
numerous
as
is
generally
supposed
but
have
erroneously
been
confounded
with
the
others
the
armenians
of
whom
there
are
in
turkey
like
other
nations
have
evinced
their
pride
in
national
pedigree
by
tracing
their
origin
to
haig
the
grandson
of
noah
and
they
call
themselves
haiks
even
at
the
present
day
in
the
year
of
the
creation
of
the
world
jewish
chronology
soon
after
the
flood
and
even
during
the
lifetime
of
noah
haig
or
haicus
with
his
sons
and
daughters
resided
in
the
country
of
senaar
in
mesapotamia
while
they
lived
in
those
regions
the
famous
tower
of
babel
was
erected
and
the
babylonian
empire
was
founded
by
belus
haig
unwilling
to
submit
to
the
authority
of
belus
returned
with
his
family
of
about
persons
to
the
country
of
ararat
where
he
incorporated
himself
with
the
earliest
settlers
in
those
regions
who
had
never
wandered
thence
and
retained
all
the
undisciplined
habits
and
freedom
of
their
utter
seclusion
from
the
progress
of
civilization
it
is
more
than
probable
that
he
and
his
descendants
continued
to
speak
the
language
of
their
father
noah
and
in
that
case
there
is
no
more
ancient
tongue
than
the
armenian
besides
while
the
descendants
of
shem
and
ham
emigrated
to
other
lands
those
of
japhet
who
begat
gomer
who
begat
togarmah
the
father
of
haig
remained
in
the
vicinity
of
ararat
and
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
ever
changed
their
language
the
biblical
history
records
the
confusion
of
languages
of
those
who
were
in
the
land
of
shinar
the
armenians
are
as
ancient
as
the
jews
and
have
ever
remained
as
separate
a
people
and
even
amid
all
their
vicissitudes
have
preserved
their
nationality
with
equal
tenacity
but
haig
was
not
left
long
in
quiet
for
belus
fearing
that
he
would
become
too
powerful
a
rival
marched
against
him
with
his
warriors
all
clad
in
iron
armour
yet
destiny
was
about
to
found
a
great
nation
and
the
small
band
of
haig
proved
victorious
an
arrow
from
the
bow
of
haig
transfixed
the
proud
belus
as
he
was
retiring
thus
was
the
first
impetus
given
to
this
embryo
empire
victory
and
the
spoils
of
war
inflamed
their
breasts
and
strengthened
their
resources
cities
were
erected
one
on
the
very
spot
of
this
battle
haig
was
a
man
of
noble
appearance
and
superior
intellect
which
must
have
had
a
perfect
development
during
his
long
life
of
five
hundred
years
his
immediate
descendants
built
fortified
towns
adorned
with
palaces
and
caravanserais
a
very
beautiful
city
was
built
by
semiramis
the
queen
of
babylon
which
occupied
workmen
and
architects
she
was
enamored
of
arah
the
armenian
king
who
was
surnamed
the
handsome
and
being
a
widow
wished
to
marry
him
but
he
disgusted
at
her
demonstrations
of
excessive
fondness
refused
the
alliance
the
consequence
was
that
she
determined
to
take
him
by
force
and
marched
with
her
troops
into
his
dominions
but
all
she
obtained
was
the
dead
body
of
the
beautiful
young
armenian
prince
which
she
endeavored
to
restore
to
life
by
magical
incantations
the
beauty
of
the
country
and
her
own
romantic
associations
inspired
her
with
the
desire
to
erect
a
monument
of
her
magnificence
and
she
founded
the
city
of
shamiram
now
called
bitlis
on
the
borders
of
lake
van
which
became
ever
after
her
summer
residence
the
armenians
enjoyed
a
long
period
of
prosperity
waging
successful
wars
with
the
syrians
medes
persians
and
other
neighboring
nations
until
they
were
at
last
conquered
by
alexander
the
great
and
remained
tributary
to
him
for
years
under
governors
appointed
by
him
and
by
his
successors
the
seleucidæ
they
now
changed
masters
and
enjoyed
great
prosperity
under
the
arsacidæ
or
parthians
who
freed
them
from
the
seleucian
yoke
their
prosperity
lasted
for
years
until
internal
dissensions
rendered
them
easy
victims
to
the
intrigues
of
the
greeks
and
persians
who
eventually
divided
this
beautiful
domain
between
them
oppression
of
all
sorts
spiritual
and
temporal
now
pervaded
the
once
peaceful
and
happy
homes
of
this
fated
race
royal
blood
could
not
quench
the
fire
of
its
rage
profusely
shed
by
the
princes
in
defence
of
their
people
and
religion
idolatry
was
enshrined
upon
the
altars
and
the
priesthood
sacrificed
to
fire
and
tortured
upon
the
rack
a
temporary
relief
was
afforded
to
the
country
by
the
rise
of
the
bagratian
princes
who
were
the
descendants
of
abraham
and
who
first
came
into
armenia
during
the
captivity
of
the
jews
under
nebuchadnezzar
bagarat
the
founder
of
this
jewish
line
of
princes
was
distinguished
in
the
reign
of
valarsace
and
was
appointed
by
him
to
the
hereditary
office
of
placing
the
crown
upon
the
king
head
and
all
his
descendants
were
known
as
the
bagratians
now
it
happened
that
ashot
one
of
their
number
so
pleased
the
caliph
in
his
administration
of
the
affairs
of
his
own
tribe
that
in
the
year
he
appointed
him
governor
of
armenia
and
dispatched
an
apostate
armenian
to
invest
him
with
magnificent
robes
of
state
although
the
nation
was
again
restored
to
comparative
tranquillity
under
this
race
of
princes
yet
internal
disunion
and
foreign
oppression
did
not
cease
to
harass
the
country
and
the
greeks
finally
destroyed
the
bagratian
monarchy
but
of
persia
regained
his
sway
over
armenia
and
the
power
of
the
greeks
was
thenceforth
annihilated
the
armenian
princes
of
the
line
of
reuben
now
governed
the
country
and
it
was
during
their
reign
that
the
crusaders
took
jerusalem
and
while
they
were
besieging
antioch
constantine
the
second
of
these
armenian
princes
supplied
the
army
with
provisions
he
was
in
return
made
a
marquis
and
received
the
order
of
knighthood
besides
many
valuable
presents
this
line
of
princes
was
extirpated
by
the
egyptians
who
poured
an
immense
and
devastating
army
into
their
country
and
after
besieging
leo
the
last
king
for
nine
months
took
him
and
all
his
family
to
cairo
with
all
the
royal
treasures
they
remained
in
prison
seven
years
because
they
refused
to
renounce
christianity
by
the
intervention
of
king
juan
of
spain
they
were
set
at
liberty
and
received
from
him
many
valuable
possessions
such
as
houses
and
lands
king
leo
even
appealed
to
england
and
france
to
assist
him
in
regaining
the
throne
of
armenia
but
without
any
good
success
he
died
in
paris
and
was
buried
in
the
convent
of
celestine
his
wife
mary
who
belonged
to
the
family
of
lewis
charles
king
of
hungary
died
at
jerusalem
the
armenians
next
fell
into
the
power
of
the
ottomans
with
their
last
king
their
glory
perished
the
sunrise
over
mount
ararat
the
meridian
brightness
over
the
fairest
portion
of
asia
and
the
last
departing
rays
shed
over
the
regions
of
silicia
are
all
merged
into
the
dark
pages
of
history
where
but
few
ever
seek
to
read
the
tale
the
ancient
religion
of
the
armenians
was
that
of
the
magi
but
the
introduction
of
christianity
among
them
was
coeval
with
christ
abgar
one
of
their
kings
having
had
occasion
to
send
ambassadors
to
the
roman
general
marinus
in
syria
upon
the
return
of
his
messengers
was
apprised
of
the
wonderful
and
miraculous
performances
of
the
messiah
giving
a
ready
credence
to
the
report
that
this
was
indeed
the
son
of
god
a
second
embassy
was
sent
to
entreat
the
great
healer
of
the
sick
to
visit
the
king
abgar
who
was
laboring
under
a
distressing
malady
the
letter
was
as
follows
i
have
heard
that
the
jews
murmur
against
you
and
seek
to
destroy
you
i
have
a
small
but
beautiful
city
which
i
offer
you
to
partake
with
me
it
is
sufficient
for
us
both
it
is
said
that
the
saviour
received
this
embassy
with
much
satisfaction
and
dictated
to
the
apostle
thomas
this
remarkable
reply
when
i
shall
rise
to
my
glory
i
will
send
you
one
of
my
disciples
who
shall
remove
your
pains
and
give
life
to
you
and
those
around
you
after
the
ascension
of
christ
according
to
his
request
thaddeus
one
of
the
seventy
was
sent
to
edessa
who
having
instructed
the
king
in
the
true
faith
baptized
him
and
the
citizens
of
that
metropolis
the
seeds
of
christianity
were
thus
early
sown
in
armenia
still
but
little
progress
was
made
until
the
appearance
of
gregory
of
cesarea
three
centuries
later
who
created
such
a
revival
of
this
faith
that
he
was
called
the
illuminator
and
his
followers
the
gregorians
the
armenian
resembles
the
greek
church
in
some
respects
they
are
both
episcopal
in
their
government
both
acknowledge
the
trinity
and
the
immaculacy
of
the
holy
virgin
and
perform
the
ceremony
of
the
lord
supper
or
the
mass
with
even
more
pomp
than
the
catholics
the
armenians
believe
the
divine
and
human
nature
of
christ
to
be
so
blended
as
to
form
but
one
whereas
the
greeks
declare
them
to
be
entirely
separate
therefore
the
former
in
administering
the
eucharist
use
only
wine
and
unleavened
bread
and
the
latter
mingle
water
with
the
wine
and
use
leaven
in
the
bread
the
armenians
in
case
of
necessity
partake
of
the
holy
sacrament
in
other
christian
churches
whereas
the
greeks
acknowledge
no
church
ceremonies
as
canonical
but
their
own
always
those
who
may
wish
to
come
under
their
spiritual
jurisdiction
their
manner
of
signing
the
cross
even
differs
the
one
making
it
from
left
to
right
and
the
other
from
right
to
left
they
celebrate
the
church
festivals
on
different
days
and
find
many
other
occasions
on
which
to
disagree
the
armenians
are
not
therefore
to
be
confounded
with
the
greeks
nor
with
that
sect
called
arminians
or
the
followers
of
arminius
but
as
a
distinct
people
originally
inhabiting
the
country
about
mount
ararat
and
professing
christianity
at
an
early
period
the
reason
why
they
are
known
to
the
western
nations
as
the
armenians
and
not
by
their
proper
name
haiks
is
that
when
aram
one
of
their
early
kings
and
the
father
of
ara
the
handsome
succeeded
to
the
throne
of
armenia
he
by
his
wisdom
and
policy
so
greatly
extended
his
dominions
that
the
power
and
valor
of
the
nation
was
acknowledged
from
mount
caucasus
to
mount
tauris
this
prince
first
raised
his
people
to
any
degree
of
renown
both
by
the
exercise
of
arms
and
the
cultivation
of
the
arts
of
peace
so
that
contemporary
nations
in
making
mention
of
the
actions
performed
by
his
subjects
called
them
the
deeds
of
the
aramians
or
the
followers
of
aram
a
name
which
has
been
corrupted
into
armenians
the
country
which
these
people
originally
inhabited
was
called
by
them
haikastan
or
hayasdan
and
those
regions
which
were
added
to
their
territories
by
the
conquest
of
prince
aram
were
called
aramia
or
in
contradistinction
to
each
other
the
former
were
called
the
greater
and
the
latter
the
lesser
hayasdan
which
the
western
nations
transcribed
as
armenia
major
and
minor
it
will
be
perceived
that
they
were
at
one
time
a
very
powerful
and
flourishing
nation
and
were
the
envy
of
all
the
neighboring
tribes
facts
well
authenticated
even
by
roman
historians
in
the
reign
of
tigranes
many
unfortunate
princes
who
had
fallen
prisoners
to
the
armenian
king
were
obliged
to
stand
in
his
presence
in
an
attitude
of
oriental
deference
with
arms
folded
on
their
breasts
in
token
of
perfect
submission
four
of
these
wretched
monarchs
had
also
to
attend
him
constantly
in
their
regal
robes
and
when
he
appeared
in
public
on
horseback
his
royal
captives
preceded
him
on
foot
mithridates
the
uncle
to
the
king
tigranes
rendered
himself
no
less
glorious
he
extended
his
dominions
even
to
the
borders
of
scythia
his
subjects
and
tributaries
comprised
nations
and
it
is
related
that
this
prince
conversed
with
equal
fluency
in
all
the
languages
spoken
by
those
peoples
even
hannibal
the
great
carthaginian
general
found
an
asylum
in
armenia
in
the
time
of
their
greatest
prosperity
they
amounted
to
of
souls
but
constant
wars
with
their
attendant
train
of
famine
disease
and
death
have
sadly
diminished
their
numbers
and
reduced
them
to
less
than
five
millions
the
depopulated
condition
of
their
provinces
and
the
internal
dissension
of
their
princes
favored
the
depredatory
invasions
of
various
nations
romans
greeks
persians
saracens
and
scythians
or
turks
these
last
finally
crossing
over
the
caspian
mountains
in
hordes
subjugated
them
and
took
possession
of
their
immense
territories
and
have
ever
since
held
them
in
bondage
the
armenians
were
the
first
christians
who
were
subjugated
by
the
mussulmans
and
as
they
were
the
earliest
christian
subjects
they
became
in
their
mutual
relations
the
model
or
measure
for
all
succeeding
conquests
for
the
turks
profiting
by
their
first
experience
ever
after
practised
accordingly
the
conquerors
imbued
with
a
spirit
of
islamism
added
to
their
barbarities
a
system
of
religious
persecution
the
cruelties
which
they
committed
on
the
inhabitants
were
horrible
in
the
extreme
aged
men
and
women
were
often
tied
in
pairs
and
then
together
cut
in
halves
pregnant
women
were
frequently
ripped
open
and
their
unborn
babes
wantonly
thrown
into
the
air
infants
sucking
at
the
breast
were
torn
from
the
arms
and
massacred
before
the
eyes
of
their
distracted
mothers
so
that
human
blood
flowed
in
torrents
throughout
the
country
and
well
may
the
osmanlis
of
the
present
day
regard
the
very
name
of
turk
opprobrious
as
it
reminds
them
of
former
barbarities
at
last
these
persecutions
and
cruelties
ceased
for
perceiving
the
advantages
which
they
might
derive
from
this
hardy
and
industrious
race
and
finding
them
also
strong
and
enthusiastic
in
their
faith
the
persecutors
moderated
their
religious
ardor
and
adopting
a
more
politic
course
opened
negotiations
with
the
armenians
and
willingly
compromised
by
making
them
tributaries
with
the
payment
of
kharadj
or
poll
tax
as
recommended
by
the
koran
and
by
kind
promises
for
the
future
their
servitude
was
rendered
more
tolerable
besides
with
the
design
of
ruling
them
through
religions
prejudices
the
armenians
were
granted
the
privilege
of
being
governed
by
one
of
their
own
priesthood
to
whom
they
gave
the
title
of
patrik
or
patriarch
the
people
being
now
deprived
of
all
civil
rights
regarded
this
patriarch
as
the
sole
bond
of
national
unity
the
turks
on
their
part
finding
it
an
easy
policy
to
govern
the
mass
through
one
individual
allowed
great
privileges
to
this
office
and
the
free
exercise
of
the
principles
of
their
own
religion
in
its
administration
the
power
of
the
patriarch
was
so
unlimited
that
he
could
even
levy
taxes
punish
any
person
with
the
bastinado
imprison
or
send
into
exile
national
enthusiasm
and
the
politic
tolerance
of
their
conquerors
in
the
course
of
time
led
the
patriarchs
into
the
abuse
of
their
privileges
cloaked
though
they
were
under
the
mantle
of
religion
their
despotism
was
not
always
exempt
from
impunity
for
the
people
long
accustomed
to
regard
the
church
apart
from
temporal
authorities
could
not
brook
such
conduct
in
their
high
priest
and
therefore
there
has
always
been
a
strife
between
them
and
the
priesthood
the
government
has
sometimes
sustained
the
popular
will
and
at
others
the
rights
of
the
pontiff
as
interest
or
policy
required
this
community
constitutes
the
very
life
of
turkey
for
the
turks
long
accustomed
to
rule
rather
than
serve
have
relinquished
to
them
all
branches
of
industry
hence
the
armenians
are
the
bankers
merchants
mechanics
and
traders
of
all
sorts
in
turkey
besides
there
exists
a
congeniality
of
sentiment
and
community
of
interest
between
them
and
the
mussulmans
for
being
originally
from
the
same
region
they
were
alike
in
their
habits
and
feelings
therefore
easily
assimilating
themselves
to
their
conquerors
they
gained
their
confidence
and
became
and
still
are
the
most
influential
of
all
the
rayas
there
is
not
a
pasha
or
a
grandee
who
is
not
indebted
to
them
either
pecuniarily
or
for
his
promotion
and
the
humblest
peasant
owes
them
the
value
of
the
very
seed
he
sows
so
that
without
them
the
osmanlis
could
not
survive
a
single
day
this
is
a
fact
so
well
attested
that
russia
with
the
design
of
undermining
turkey
always
endeavored
to
gain
over
this
part
of
the
population
and
in
when
she
took
possession
of
erzeroum
she
enticed
the
armenians
of
that
place
to
acts
of
violence
and
revenge
against
the
turks
so
that
when
the
russians
retired
the
armenians
were
obliged
to
emigrate
with
them
besides
in
the
demarcation
of
her
boundaries
with
turkey
she
so
managed
as
to
embody
etchmiadzin
the
see
of
the
high
pontiff
of
the
armenians
within
her
own
territories
for
the
express
purpose
of
governing
them
through
their
spiritual
head
even
the
correspondent
of
the
london
morning
post
in
speaking
of
the
corruptions
of
the
country
in
his
ribaldry
termed
the
armenians
the
cloaca
of
turkey
accusing
them
of
being
the
means
through
whom
all
the
filth
passed
naturally
endowed
with
a
brave
and
warlike
spirit
of
noble
and
intelligent
appearance
and
great
athletic
vigor
their
services
have
ever
been
invaluable
to
the
country
it
has
only
been
their
protracted
servitude
which
has
reduced
them
to
the
timid
and
cautious
temperament
that
they
now
possess
some
have
even
distinguished
themselves
as
statesmen
patriots
and
faithful
servants
had
it
not
been
for
the
good
advice
and
diplomacy
of
abro
or
as
he
is
commonly
known
to
europe
of
boghos
bey
mehmed
aali
could
not
have
secured
to
his
heirs
the
independence
of
egypt
again
at
the
conclusion
of
the
last
war
with
russia
when
sultan
mahmoud
was
writhing
under
his
inability
to
meet
the
peremptory
demands
of
his
enemy
an
armenian
came
to
his
rescue
kazaz
artyn
was
a
most
noted
personage
of
the
armenian
nation
having
risen
from
the
lowest
rank
in
life
he
finally
became
the
head
of
the
royal
mint
and
the
friend
and
factotum
of
his
majesty
sultan
mahmoud
who
never
passed
a
day
without
seeing
him
he
was
so
much
beloved
by
his
imperial
master
that
although
he
was
a
giavour
his
majesty
visited
him
at
his
last
hours
this
condescension
was
not
only
remarkable
in
the
king
but
more
wonderful
in
a
mussulman
for
the
koran
forbids
all
intimacy
with
christians
o
true
believers
take
not
the
jews
or
christians
for
your
friends
they
are
friends
the
one
to
the
other
but
whoso
among
you
taketh
them
for
his
friends
he
is
surely
one
of
them
this
passage
explains
the
antipathy
of
the
mohammedans
to
all
christians
as
well
as
to
the
institutions
of
christianity
sultan
mahmoud
being
of
an
imperious
nature
waived
such
religious
considerations
when
impelled
by
gratitude
and
no
one
of
the
ministry
dared
to
breathe
a
censure
against
the
imperial
will
for
as
sultan
he
was
not
only
above
the
law
but
the
law
itself
besides
every
one
knew
the
extent
of
kazaz
artyn
services
to
his
royal
master
at
the
end
of
the
last
war
when
the
russian
indemnities
were
to
be
paid
there
was
not
a
single
piaster
in
the
treasury
the
sultan
in
despair
shut
himself
up
and
forbade
any
one
to
approach
him
but
reckless
of
consequences
kazaz
artyn
rushed
into
the
royal
presence
and
anxiously
begged
to
be
informed
the
cause
of
his
majesty
grief
the
muscovite
giavours
are
insisting
upon
their
indemnities
and
i
am
told
the
treasury
is
empty
whereupon
kazaz
artyn
assured
his
majesty
that
their
demands
should
be
met
even
on
the
very
next
day
he
accordingly
summoned
all
the
bankers
and
collected
the
necessary
funds
which
were
transmitted
to
the
russian
embassy
to
their
utter
astonishment
in
the
course
of
hours
this
money
remained
at
the
russian
embassy
out
of
which
they
were
accustomed
to
pay
the
salaries
of
the
whole
legation
etc
the
bankers
were
afterwards
repaid
in
beshliks
a
species
of
spurious
coin
which
are
now
being
redeemed
by
the
present
sultan
the
cultivation
of
the
arts
and
sciences
were
of
an
early
origin
with
the
armenians
in
the
reign
of
valarsace
the
parthian
the
archives
of
nineveh
were
searched
by
maribas
and
made
to
contribute
to
the
literature
of
the
nation
and
during
arsaces
reign
the
city
of
armavir
was
embellished
with
several
pieces
of
beautiful
statuary
which
were
taken
from
the
greeks
three
in
particular
those
of
diana
hercules
and
apollo
well
executed
brazen
and
gilt
were
from
the
hands
of
the
celebrated
cretan
artists
scyllis
and
dipænus
duin
ani
edessa
and
several
other
cities
were
noted
for
their
architectural
beauties
and
considering
that
armenia
is
coeval
with
the
babylonian
empire
there
is
no
reason
to
doubt
that
researches
into
its
territories
would
be
as
interesting
as
those
of
mossoul
the
armenians
having
no
alphabet
of
their
own
adopted
the
characters
of
other
nations
the
syriac
in
religious
writings
the
greek
in
scientific
works
and
the
persian
for
statutes
of
law
but
at
the
commencement
of
the
century
a
monk
mesrop
by
name
invented
the
present
characters
which
have
been
in
use
ever
since
they
are
neat
in
appearance
and
capable
of
representing
any
articulate
sound
thirty
nine
in
number
and
styled
by
lord
byron
a
waterloo
of
an
alphabet
there
is
no
doubt
that
they
early
possessed
some
literature
of
their
own
prior
to
the
invention
of
their
alphabet
for
even
the
writings
of
eusebius
were
originally
discovered
in
the
archives
of
the
armenians
many
very
eminent
works
generally
in
mss
on
martyrology
and
the
affairs
of
the
church
are
still
extant
and
it
is
reported
that
the
old
monasteries
in
armenia
contain
records
of
history
which
if
brought
to
light
would
prove
great
additions
to
the
annals
of
very
ancient
times
they
boast
of
classic
authors
to
whom
lord
byron
alludes
in
eulogistic
terms
and
the
works
of
moses
of
khoren
which
have
been
translated
are
highly
appreciated
by
the
literati
of
europe
the
armenians
of
the
present
day
are
also
many
of
them
distinguished
for
their
acquisitions
in
both
armenian
and
turkish
literature
and
so
great
is
their
aptitude
for
acquiring
languages
that
they
are
often
well
versed
in
the
various
dialects
of
europe
even
the
children
are
in
the
daily
habit
of
speaking
three
different
languages
turkish
armenian
and
greek
in
their
domestic
relations
living
in
constant
intercourse
with
the
osmanlis
and
the
lapse
of
time
throwing
the
veil
of
oblivion
over
their
past
sufferings
all
their
habits
of
life
and
general
ideas
have
become
assimilated
to
those
of
their
masters
with
those
distinctions
only
which
result
from
the
tenets
of
their
faith
has
forced
them
to
seclude
their
women
from
the
public
and
hence
they
have
the
same
domestic
arrangements
style
of
dress
as
those
of
the
osmanlis
their
social
institutions
like
other
orientals
are
very
patriarchal
every
man
being
a
monarch
in
his
own
family
and
the
children
are
educated
to
observe
the
greatest
deference
and
respect
to
their
parents
no
son
or
daughter
ever
dreams
of
contracting
a
marriage
on
their
own
responsibility
but
the
destined
bride
is
selected
by
the
mother
and
her
friends
and
is
thankfully
accepted
by
the
happy
son
the
betrothal
having
been
arranged
with
all
due
ceremony
the
wedding
takes
place
at
the
appointed
time
the
marriage
ceremonies
are
celebrated
both
at
the
house
of
the
bride
and
of
the
bridegroom
during
three
days
the
bride
is
conducted
by
the
bridegroom
and
his
friends
to
the
house
of
her
intended
husband
and
the
ceremony
is
performed
on
sunday
at
midnight
the
bride
muffled
and
tinselled
is
conducted
to
a
carpet
in
the
middle
of
the
saloon
where
she
is
placed
opposite
to
the
chosen
bridegroom
their
right
hands
are
joined
by
the
officiating
priest
and
they
are
severally
demanded
whether
they
will
love
cherish
and
honor
each
other
the
man
is
also
asked
as
he
stands
opposite
to
this
mass
of
shawls
and
tinsel
will
you
take
this
girl
whether
she
be
lame
or
deaf
or
humped
or
blind
to
which
he
responds
with
due
resignation
even
so
i
will
take
her
a
silken
cord
twisted
of
two
colors
is
now
tied
round
the
head
of
each
and
after
a
long
service
reading
of
prayers
and
chanting
the
happy
pair
are
pronounced
man
and
wife
the
bride
over
whose
varying
emotions
during
the
interesting
ceremonies
an
impenetrable
veil
was
suspended
is
now
led
by
two
attendants
to
a
corner
of
the
sofa
where
she
is
temporarily
enthroned
on
a
cushion
the
propitious
moment
has
at
last
arrived
and
the
legalized
husband
may
ascertain
for
himself
the
measure
of
charms
to
which
he
is
allied
while
the
agitated
maiden
sits
oppressed
by
shawls
and
tinsel
and
internal
anxiety
as
to
the
effect
she
may
produce
upon
her
future
lord
he
slowly
approaches
pale
and
tottering
for
he
has
sworn
to
have
her
blind
or
with
such
alternatives
even
a
moderate
share
of
or
the
mere
absence
of
actual
deformity
would
almost
constitute
beauty
the
attendant
bridemaids
exultingly
raise
the
veil
and
the
new
husband
ventures
to
take
one
look
of
love
and
admiration
in
return
for
which
he
places
a
valuable
ring
on
her
finger
and
slowly
retreats
to
muse
upon
his
fate
which
is
not
often
so
deplorable
for
the
armenian
girls
are
generally
pretty
at
all
events
he
submits
with
the
best
grace
for
unlike
his
mohammedan
compatriots
he
has
no
retrieve
or
door
of
escape
but
must
abide
by
his
bargain
till
death
us
do
part
the
veil
is
again
dropped
and
the
bride
left
to
her
own
meditations
she
receives
presents
from
all
the
guests
so
that
the
tickets
of
admission
to
an
armenian
wedding
are
no
trivial
affairs
to
pockets
three
days
after
the
ceremony
the
newly
married
couple
are
at
length
left
to
a
better
acquaintance
unmolested
by
veils
or
spectators
the
sunday
following
the
bridegroom
proceeds
to
his
house
to
acknowledge
his
gratitude
for
the
possession
of
such
a
charming
treasure
all
which
is
expressed
by
the
ceremony
of
kissing
the
hands
of
the
parents
of
the
maiden
and
this
sunday
is
called
par
excellence
the
kissing
sunday
these
are
the
real
armenians
but
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
there
was
a
secession
in
favor
of
catholicism
the
catholic
armenians
of
whom
there
are
about
fifteen
thousand
in
the
metropolis
and
thousand
throughout
turkey
although
distinct
from
the
roman
catholics
have
assimilated
themselves
in
many
respects
to
european
habits
forgetting
their
nationality
and
language
and
aping
customs
and
usages
they
do
not
even
understand
so
much
so
that
a
very
amusing
work
has
been
written
in
under
the
title
of
acaby
as
a
burlesque
upon
such
inclinations
they
are
not
therefore
to
be
confounded
with
the

enamored
throng
tripped
through
the
mazes
of
their
fantastic
romaica
to
the
tinkling
music
but
the
grecian
prince
is
hurled
from
his
throne
and
the
grave
and
sombre
moslem
sits
there
the
despot
and
bloody
conqueror
the
great
temple
which
rivalled
even
that
of
solomon
is
suddenly
divested
of
the
symbols
of
a
christian
faith
its
mosaics
of
the
saints
which
adorn
the
walls
are
obliterated
its
cherubim
are
torn
down
its
altar
demolished
and
nothing
left
of
all
the
gorgeous
decorations
the
bare
unadorned
niche
the
mihrab
or
index
to
the
temple
of
mohammed
is
instituted
and
is
henceforth
the
cry
of
the
faithful
yet
they
say
the
distant
chant
of
the
last
officiating
priest
of
the
greek
religion
still
lingers
within
the
walls
from
whence
he
will
issue
when
the
edifice
is
restored
to
its
original
worship
sports
are
over
maidens
and
youths
are
coy
of
their
charms
for
a
change
has
come
over
the
spirit
of
their
dreams
the
liberty
of
woman
is
shackled
and
the
dominion
of
seclusion
established
certain
quarters
of
the
city
are
assigned
to
the
greek
subjects
and
externally
their
very
dwellings
assume
the
dusky
tints
of
bondage
and
ruin
truly
their
glory
has
departed
and
their
name
as
a
nation
is
only
sustained
by
the
shades
of
their
ancient
heroes
who
even
after
their
last
degenerate
descendant
has
mouldered
into
dust
will
continue
to
flit
around
the
civilized
world
scattering
the
scintillations
of
early
genius
amid
earth
darkness
yet
as
it
is
their
nature
to
boast
they
point
into
the
past
and
even
one
day
hope
to
sit
on
the
throne
of
their
ancestors
eis
tin
polin
of
yore
there
are
no
less
than
a
million
and
a
half
of
greeks
in
the
turkish
dominions
of
whom
live
in
the
capital
at
the
time
of
their
conquest
the
turks
allowed
them
the
same
municipal
immunities
and
privileges
as
they
had
done
to
the
armenians
as
the
greeks
seemed
to
approximate
more
nearly
to
the
western
nations
in
their
habits
than
any
of
the
other
rayahs
the
osmanlis
supposed
them
more
fitted
to
act
as
intermediaries
between
themselves
and
the
european
states
they
therefore
became
the
first
interpreters
of
the
divan
many
of
their
number
have
thus
risen
to
wealth
and
distinction
and
after
long
services
they
even
succeeded
to
the
government
of
the
danubian
principalities
yet
the
osmanlis
have
never
felt
the
same
sympathy
and
confidence
towards
them
as
for
the
armenians
who
though
not
so
advanced
in
civilization
possess
better
stamina
of
character
greater
honesty
and
more
congeniality
of
temperament
many
greeks
even
now
occupy
places
of
trust
which
are
confided
to
them
rather
from
political
motives
than
as
marks
of
peculiar
confidence
the
office
of
saraf
or
banker
which
is
equivalent
to
homme
de
confiance
has
never
been
successfully
filled
by
them
though
attempts
have
been
made
to
do
so
this
post
has
invariably
been
assigned
to
the
armenians
it
is
customary
with
the
osmanli
grandee
when
appointed
to
some
high
station
in
the
provinces
before
their
departure
to
leave
with
their
banker
a
certain
number
of
blanks
to
be
filled
by
him
whenever
occasion
should
require
their
use
and
many
even
entrust
their
personal
property
to
the
sarafs
on
their
pilgrimage
to
mecca
for
safe
keeping
one
of
the
principal
dignitaries
of
the
present
day
who
is
reputed
for
his
irascible
temper
was
some
years
ago
involved
in
a
dilemma
one
of
his
attendants
was
found
to
be
guilty
of
a
liaison
with
a
slave
in
his
harem
the
circumstances
were
aggravating
and
his
pride
could
not
be
satisfied
save
by
dire
revenge
and
the
two
instead
of
being
married
according
to
the
custom
of
the
country
fell
victims
to
his
fury
but
after
the
commission
of
the
rash
act
he
repented
and
began
to
fear
the
disgrace
which
would
probably
fall
on
himself
in
his
perplexity
he
sent
for
his
old
armenian
saraf
and
when
closeted
with
him
poured
his
sorrows
into
the
bosom
of
his
confidant
relating
to
him
the
whole
circumstance
weeping
bitterly
for
his
act
and
asking
advice
and
consolation
now
no
osmanli
has
as
yet
evinced
such
confidence
and
sympathy
towards
the
greeks
besides
the
pride
of
the
mussulmans
is
not
compromised
in
associating
with
the
armenians
who
are
so
much
like
their
masters
in
manners
and
language
that
often
it
is
impossible
to
detect
any
difference
on
the
contrary
although
some
of
the
greeks
have
distinguished
themselves
in
oriental
literature
especially
yacobaky
in
his
history
of
russia
written
in
elegant
turkish
yet
they
have
never
been
able
to
speak
the
language
of
the
country
correctly
the
moment
they
open
their
mouths
out
leaps
the
native
accent
this
is
equally
true
of
the
french
and
other
languages
and
even
their
own
beautiful
hellenic
can
scarce
ever
be
heard
in
stamboul
a
miserable
mongrel
island
dialect
being
the
substitute
the
character
of
the
greeks
of
constantinople
is
thus
admirably
portrayed
by
the
author
of
anastasius
the
best
work
extant
on
turkey
the
complexion
of
the
modern
greek
may
receive
a
different
cast
from
different
surrounding
objects
the
core
still
is
the
same
as
in
the
days
of
pericles
credulity
versatility
and
thirst
of
distinction
from
the
earliest
periods
formed
still
form
and
ever
will
continue
to
form
the
basis
of
the
greek
character
and
the
dissimilarity
in
the
external
appearance
of
the
nation
arises
not
from
any
radical
change
in
its
temper
and
disposition
but
only
from
the
incidental
variation
in
the
means
through
which
the
same
propensities
are
to
be
gratified
the
ancient
greeks
worshipped
a
hundred
gods
the
modern
greeks
adore
as
many
saints
the
ancient
greeks
believed
in
oracles
and
prodigies
in
incantations
and
spells
the
modern
greeks
have
faith
in
relics
and
miracles
in
amulets
and
divinations
the
ancient
greeks
brought
rich
offerings
and
gifts
to
the
shrines
of
their
deities
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
success
in
war
and
in
peace
the
modern
greeks
hang
up
dirty
rags
round
the
sanctuaries
of
their
saints
to
shake
off
an
ague
or
propitiate
a
mistress
the
former
were
staunch
patriots
at
home
and
subtle
courtiers
in
persia
the
latter
defy
the
turks
in
mayno
and
fawn
upon
them
at
the
fanar
besides
was
not
every
commonwealth
of
ancient
greece
as
much
a
prey
to
cabals
and
factions
as
every
community
of
modern
greece
does
not
every
modern
greek
preserve
the
same
desire
for
supremacy
the
same
readiness
to
undermine
by
every
means
fair
or
foul
his
competitors
which
was
displayed
by
his
ancestors
do
not
the
turks
of
the
present
day
resemble
the
romans
of
past
ages
in
their
respect
for
the
ingenuity
and
at
the
same
time
in
their
contempt
for
the
character
of
their
greek
subjects
and
does
the
greek
of
the
fanar
show
the
least
inferiority
to
the
greek
of
the
piræus
in
quickness
of
perception
in
fluency
of
tongue
and
in
fondness
for
quibbles
for
disputation
and
for
sophistry
believe
me
the
very
difference
between
the
greeks
of
time
past
and
of
the
present
day
arises
only
from
their
thorough
resemblance
from
that
equal
pliability
of
temper
and
of
faculties
in
both
which
has
ever
made
them
receive
with
equal
readiness
the
impression
of
every
mould
and
the
impulse
of
every
agent
when
patriotism
public
spirit
and
in
arts
science
literature
and
warfare
were
the
road
to
distinction
the
greeks
shone
the
first
of
patriots
of
heroes
of
painters
of
poets
and
of
philosophers
now
that
craft
and
subtlety
adulation
and
intrigue
are
the
only
paths
to
greatness
these
same
greeks
are
what
you
see
them
although
the
armenians
have
borne
the
first
impetus
of
mussulman
fanaticism
and
consequently
suffered
more
than
any
other
christian
subjects
yet
the
greeks
excel
them
in
their
animosity
towards
their
conquerors
this
is
owing
to
their
excessive
bigotry
and
it
is
recorded
that
even
while
the
enemy
was
before
the
gates
of
constantinople
they
were
discussing
the
great
question
whether
the
holy
ghost
proceeded
from
the
father
or
the
son
this
disposition
to
cavil
on
religious
points
has
made
them
a
ready
prey
to
the
domineering
priesthood
who
have
completely
swayed
the
multitude
these
priests
being
a
mean
and
grovelling
set
utterly
indifferent
to
the
moral
elevation
of
their
people
are
ever
ready
to
make
traffic
of
the
sins
of
those
who
are
still
more
ignorant
than
themselves
the
consequence
is
that
lying
cheating
stealing
and
other
immoralities
to
any
extent
are
very
common
among
this
community
for
a
few
piastres
or
even
paras
cancel
the
crime
and
lull
the
conscience
the
whole
community
suffers
from
such
a
system
as
business
and
other
necessities
bring
them
into
constant
contact
the
servants
are
generally
greek
and
there
is
no
virtue
in
lock
and
key
in
any
house
you
suddenly
find
your
wardrobe
emptied
by
imperceptible
degrees
and
the
jars
of
preserves
gradually
diminish
as
they
are
repeatedly
licked
and
sleeked
over
again
divorces
are
easily
obtained
or
they
are
granted
after
the
priest
has
extorted
the
last
para
he
can
from
the
applicant
the
corruption
of
the
masses
through
their
spiritual
leaders
is
painfully
evident
the
most
dire
superstition
rules
every
mind
and
the
veriest
knaves
and
even
prostitutes
follow
their
injurious
callings
without
compunction
if
under
the
patronage
of
one
of
their
saints
christos
kai
panayiaumo
is
an
expiatory
charm
and
the
dingy
portrait
of
any
saint
in
the
calendar
annihilates
the
bad
effects
of
every
crime
the
most
abandoned
class
of
women
are
generally
greeks
and
while
they
perform
the
obscene
rites
of
bacchus
and
venus
they
watch
with
holy
trembling
the
twinkling
taper
which
burns
night
and
day
before
the
anointed
picture
of
their
guardian
angel
this
flame
like
the
vestal
fire
is
never
suffered
to
go
out
if
perchance
dii
avertite
omen
the
greek
islands
furnish
a
miserable
set
of
men
and
women
to
the
population
of
turkey
who
come
to
gather
spoils
in
the
metropolis
and
then
return
to
enjoy
them
at
home
robberies
and
even
assassinations
are
committed
by
them
which
if
they
are
detected
are
either
protected
by
the
greek
legation
or
punished
by
a
short
imprisonment
and
then
the
miscreants
are
again
let
loose
hardened
in
crime
and
thirsting
to
revenge
their
temporary
detention
it
is
only
within
the
last
two
years
that
a
famous
bandit
in
the
vicinity
of
smyrna
has
been
captured
katurjy
yanny
and
his
merry
men
had
long
infested
the
neighboring
mountains
detaining
gentlemen
on
their
travels
carrying
them
blindfolded
to
their
den
and
only
liberating
them
upon
the
receipt
of
a
handsome
ransom
from
their
friends
the
eagle
of
the
mountain
was
at
last
caged
in
the
humble
prison
of
smyrna
while
other
miserable
victims
were
peeping
through
their
latticed
and
iron
bound
casements
whining
out
a
feeble
cry
for
alms
he
the
proud
chieftain
sat
upon
a
sofa
dressed
in
the
picturesque
costume
of
the
greek
mountaineer
his
eyes
flashing
defiance
and
his
lofty
bearing
all
princely
as
he
puffed
his
narghillé
and
chatted
with
those
about
him
but
he
must
now
feel
somewhat
as
day
succeeds
day
and
he
still
dwells
within
the
awful
precincts
of
the
bagnio
whence
like
the
rest
of
its
miserable
occupants
the
once
proud
katurgy
yanny
sometimes
emerges
broom
in
hand
and
chained
to
his
fellow
to
sweep
the
streets
of
the
metropolis
the
restless
temperament
and
fanaticism
of
the
greeks
have
ever
made
them
the
most
turbulent
of
the
ottoman
subjects
and
ready
instruments

the
hands
of

sowing

the
jews
of
turkey
of
whom
there
are
about
are
by
no
means
exempt
from
the
sorrows
and
curses
of
their
race
as
if

that
there

no

from
the
contempt
of
the

they
are
willing
to

callings
literally
to
eat
the
dirt
of
their
moslem
masters
content
to
appear
like
the
refuse
of
humanity
they
strive
to
accumulate
the
miser
hoards
and
receive
the
buffetings
and
cursings
of
their
neighbors
as

choice

usury

all
sorts
whether
upon

are
their
means
of
earning
a

the
venerated

mockingly
shout

public

having
stigmatized
them
as
utterly
depraved
they
have
no
incentive
to
honesty
and
not
daring
enough
to
commit
any
atrocious
crime
they
become
more
expert
in
petty
larcenies
and
like
misdemeanors
they
are
even
accused
of
stealing
a
christian
child
once
a
year
in
order
to
mingle
its
blood
in
their
festivals
as
a
retaliation
upon
the
christians
in
general
this
of
course
refers
to
the
mass
who
victims
as
they
are
to
misery
of
all
sorts
can
not
be
expected
to
practice
the
kindlier
virtues
which
distinguish
those
among
them
to
whom
a
better
fate
has
been
allotted
there
was
a
celebrated
armenian
banker
tcharazly
who
having
fallen
under
the
displeasure
of
a
certain
turkish
grandee
was
suddenly
one
day
seized
and
hung
before
the
door
of
his
own
dwelling
his
property
confiscated
and
his
only
son
cast
into
prison
a
certain
jewish
banker
shabgee
by
name
had
long
been
the
friend
and
neighbor
of
this
family
and
now
in
the
time
of
their
trouble
he
spared
nothing
for
the
liberation
of
the
unfortunate
young
man
the
son
of
his
friend
which
he
not
only
succeeded
in
obtaining
but
reinstated
him
in
all
the
honors
of
which
he
was
the
lawful
heir
the
jews
are
to
be
found
in
many
villages
on
the
bosphorus
though
their
principal
quarter
is
at
balat
on
the
golden
horn
they
live
also
in
other
parts
of
the
city
but
as
may
naturally
be
inferred
in
such
places
as
no
one
else
would
inhabit
their
houses
are
like
literally
swarming
with
human
life
even
one
single
room
serves
for
the
only
home
of
several
families
and
the
streets
of
their
quarters
are
almost
impassable
from
the
collection
of
garbage
and
all
sorts
of
refuse
which
are
indiscriminately
thrown
from
the
windows
of
their
dwellings
their
misery
may
partly
be
attributed
to
their
practice
of
very
early
marriages
as
before
a
man
is
years
of
age
he
is
burdened
with
the
care
and
support
of
a
numerous
family
which
reduces
him
to
such
poverty
that
even
the
meanest
economy
can
scarcely
enable
him
to
support
his
own
existence
and
that
of
the
helpless
beings
dependent
on
him
the
exactions
of
the
khakhams
or
priests
which
are
very
great
help
also
to
impoverish
this
pitiable
people
it
is
no
wonder
then
that
they
appear
in
rags
and
tatters
and
herd
together
in
styes
yet
it
is
most
amusing
to
see
them
on
a
jewish
sabbath
the
filthy
gabardines
which
they
wore
in
the
week
as
they
exercised
their
various
callings
being
laid
aside
and
bright
and
gaudy
finery
substituted
in
which
they
strut
about
the
streets
seeming
to
be
other
beings
and
to
have
no
relation
to
the
wretches
of
yesterday
but
of
course
in
such
a
population
there
will
be
various
grades
of
misery
and
a
few
families
of
wealth
are
to
be
found
among
them
they
have
some
of
the
domestic
institutions
of
the
osmanlis
and
the
women
wear
thick
white
veils
but
without
concealing
the
features
as
in
the
case
of
the
turkish
ladies
the
young
virgins
are
allowed
to
wear
their
hair
long
and
flowing
but
after
marriage
it
is
carefully
concealed
beneath
a
towering
and
cumbersome
headgear
which
is
a
wonderful
illustration
of
the
tenacity
with
which
this
singular
race
adheres
to
ancient
usages
it
recalls
to
mind
the
days
of
pharaoh
and
the
people
of
israel
for
the
similarity
is
perfect
between
their
present
and
that
of
the
mummies
who
have
reposed
in
their
tombs
ever
since
the
family
of
joseph
took
their
cattle
and
their
goods
which
they
had
gotten
in
the
land
of
canaan
and
came
into
egypt
jacob
and
all
his
seed
with
him
as
they
were
originally
from
spain
their
language
is
still
a
mongrel
dialect
of
that
country
they
are
very
strict
in
the
observance
of
their
religious
rites
and
ceremonies
never
transacting
any
business
on
the
sabbath
nor
performing
any
domestic
duties
even
their
lamps
on
sabbath
evenings
must
be
lighted
by
some
one
of
their
christian
neighbors
and
should
a
conflagration
occur
on
that
day
their
helplessness
is
truly
pitiable
for
they
will
see
all
their
property
consumed
without
making
one
effort
to
save
it
chapter
xxxviii
pera
and
the
perotes
or
franks
at
the
time
that
the
turks
took
constantinople
there
was
a
colony
of
genoese
venetians
established
in
a
suburb
of
the
city
called
galata
who
were
allowed
to
retain
this
quarter
which
occupies
the
declivity
of
the
hill
with
the
summit
called
pera
where
the
european
emigrants
attracted
by
commerce
and
other
motives
as
well
as
the
foreign
dignitaries
have
ever
since
continued
to
reside
the
warehouses
of
the
merchants
are
at
galata
which
is
connected
with
the
city
by
a
floating
bridge
across
the
golden
horn
a
little
above
galata
on
the
bosphorus
is
a
turkish
quarter
called
or
the
department
of
ordnance
through
which
access
is
usually
obtained
to
pera
the
most
busy
and
varied
scene
is
constantly
presented
to
the
eye
at
this
quay
the
graceful
cayiks
with
their
delicately
pointed
prows
lie
on
all
sides
some
waiting
for
the
convenience
of
passengers
and
others
engaged
in
disembarking
their
living
freight
it
is
wonderful
to
observe
the
dexterity
of
cayikgees
now
a
single
boatman
pushes
up
his
slender
craft
and
succeeds
in
gaining
just
space
enough
to
slip
in
so
closely
packed
are
the
boats
all
around
it
may
be
some
lonely
veiled
woman
who
is
safely
landed
anon
arrives
the
large
omnibus
cayik
as
completely
stored
with
live
stock
as
the
new
york
avenue
cars
on
a
sunday
the
boatmen
vociferate
and
shove
alongside
in
spite
of
all
their
competitors
the
motley
group
of
passengers
mussulmans
armenians
greeks
jews
franks
all
huddled
together
move
not
speak
not
but
fasten
their
eyes
upon
the
shore
with
the
firm
conviction
that
as
they
were
safely
landed
the
day
before
they
will
be
equally
successful
a
prolonged
shrill
musical
cry
hushes
every
other
sound
there
is
a
simultaneous
movement
among
the
cayiks
a
moment
pause
in
the
hurrying
crowd
on
shore
as
way
is
made
for
the
embassy
boat
with
its
gilded
prow
flying
colors
and
five
pair
of
oars
the
is
whispered
from
ear
to
ear
even
the
beautiful
canopied
boat
of
the
sultan
sometimes
passes
this
way
propelled
by
men
it
rapidly
glides
over
the
waters
with
the
regular
music
of
the
plashing
oars
the
cannon
peals
forth
a
royal
salute
from
the
shore
and
the
landing
of
resumes
its
bustling
appearance
thousands
of
men
women
and
children
are
daily
landed
here
of
every
rank
and
clime
and
doubtless
in
each
bosom
one
similar
emotion
for
a
moment
displaces
all
others
gratitude
for
the
footing
gained
then
rushes
in
the
vast
tide
of
human
hopes
cares
and
anxieties
the
platform
upon
which
they
step
is
wretchedly
out
of
repair
the
keahya
who
gains
a
slender
pittance
by
holding
the
boats
from
which
so
many
are
safely
landed
is
invariably
a
trembling
old
man
and
as
the
crowd
necessarily
jostle
each
other
it
is
astonishing
that
there
are
so
few
accidents
but
oriental
has
its
careful
measured
gait
and
it
is
rarely
that
any
stumble
though
turkish
indifference
leaves
cracks
crevices
and
chasms
in
yawning
boldness
there
is
a
large
open
area
just
after
you
land
apparently
nature
great
warehouse
solid
ground
for
a
foundation
and
the
vault
of
heaven
for
a
roofing
along
the
shore
lie
numberless
small
coasters
whose
crews
and
cargoes
are
alike
begrimed
with
darkness
for
they
have
come
down
from
the
black
sea
to
supply
the
city
with
charcoal
the
ordinary
fuel
and
immense
piles
of
wood
proclaim
the
demolition
of
forests
of
trees
there
too
is
a
great
market
place
or
rather
a
centre
of
attraction
to
the
venders
of
various
merchandise
whom
time
and
custom
have
established
in
their
prerogatives
for
there
is
no
building
whatever
for
the
convenience
or
protection
of
this
sort
of
commerce
here
then
in
the
open
air
are
butchers
fishmongers
bakers
fruiterers
and
an
epitome
of
practical
life
but
here
too
is
the
mosque
the
minaré
and
the
fountain
carrying
away
in
its
limped
flowing
impurities
both
spiritual
and
physical
this
fountain
is
a
beautiful
specimen
of
oriental
architecture
it
is
an
edifice
about
feet
square
built
of
pure
white
marble
beneath
the
cornice
which
surrounds
the
roof
is
a
border
of
arabesque
characters
richly
gilt
and
from
each
side
the
water
flows
into
a
marble
basin
not
far
from
this
fountain
is
a
cluster
of
small
shops
for
the
sale
of
kebabs
tobacco
bonbons
and
also
many
small
kahvés
the
kebabs
are
small
pieces
of
mutton
passed
on
iron
skewers
and
roasted
over
fires
of
ignited
charcoal
and
though
the
establishments
are
small
they
are
constantly
filled
with
groups
who
surrounding
the
copper
dishes
seem
to
attest
the
excellence
of
the
viands
after
satisfying
the
more
imperative
calls
of
nature
a
visit
to
the
or
tobacco
merchant
is
inevitable
for
not
to
mention
the
almost
hourly
use
of
the
weed
this
luxury
must
always
succeed
every
other
repast
then
a
moment
of
kief
at
the
coffee
shop
the
fumes
of
the
chibouque
a
sip
of
mocha
berry
a
little
neighborly
or
it
may
be
a
business
rendezvous
and
you
are
ready
to
proceed
up
the
steep
hill
to
pera
some
mount
their
own
horses
which
the
grooms
hold
in
attendance
others
avail
themselves
of
the
more
jaded
looking
animals
who
are
waiting
to
be
hired
and
sometimes
the
turkish
ladies
rather
antiquities
of
the
species
deliberately
mount
the
leather
hunch
on
the
hamal
back
and
they
too
ride
up
while
others
still
are
obliged
either
from
a
lack
of
a
like
independence
or
other
stringent
motives
to
go
on
mare
those
who
do
not
ascend
the
hill
disperse
in
various
directions
through
the
many
narrow
which
diverge
from
the
great
area
pera
is
the
elysium
of
the
very
essence
of
à
la
franga
the
or
of
princes
the
rendezvous
of
ministers
plenipotentiary
ministers
resident
consular
dignitaries
secretaries
of
legations
dragomans
attachés
and
all
the
élite
of
society
a
swarming
hive
of
diplomacy
only
get
inside
of
the
hive
even
as
drone
and
you
are
comme
il
faut
there
is
a
certain
imposing
mysterious
impenetrable
air
about
every
member
of
this
haute
noblesse
each
one
is
full
of
importance
each
one
is
condescending
to
the
other
all
are
on
the
qui
vive
for
a
stray
word
an
echo
of
the
diplomatic
measures
of
their
rivals
all
are
cautious
not
to
betray
by
look
or
action
any
embryo
intrigues
or
manoeuvres
thus
social
intercourse
consists
of
gracious
words
unmeaning
civilities
and
mutual
distrust
and
suspicion
those
who
have
been
born
in
pera
and
others
who
have
been
bred
there
have
one
and
all
become
so
very
diplomatic
that
conversation
ordinarily
dwindles
into
monosyllables
general
inquiries
after
health
and
prognostics
of
the
weather
the
simplest
question
is
regarded
by
them
as
an
inquisitive
intrusion
upon
their
prerogatives
and
peculiar
sphere
so
that
not
to
exceed
the
bounds
of
decorum
absolute
silence
becomes
the
only
alternative
but
when
any
sudden
change
takes
place
in
the
turkish
administration
or
a
new
public
measure
is
adopted
there
is
a
jubilee
in
this
social
clique
for
the
discussion
of
the
pros
and
cons
probabilities
and
possibilities
are
talked
over
until
the
original
theme
is
lost
sight
of
and
all
the
excitement
subsides
unless
something
else
turns
up
at
the
porte
intermarriage
has
produced
a
race
of
perotes
who
never
having
had
the
benefit
of
finding
their
proper
level
by
contact
with
a
more
elevated
and
extended
sphere
consider
themselves
the
very
salt
of
civilization
and
are
even
more
afraid
than
the
members
of
the
legations
themselves
of
mingling
in
general
society
the
honorable
distinction
of
being
a
perote
does
not
only
depend
upon
birth
but
a
still
more
essential
point
is
allegiance
to
the
catholic
religion
for
the
embassies
under
whose
wings
these
colonies
first
sheltered
themselves
were
the
representatives
of
catholic
nations
the
oriental
principle
that
religion
and
nationality
are
synonymous
had
its
effect
even
on
this
mongrel
race
who
by
degrees
came
to
consider
catholicity
as
also
identical
with
europeanism
enjoying
peculiar
immunities
as
protégés
of
these
embassies
in
their
imagined
superiority
as
catholics
to
all
around
them
they
regarded
the
rest
of
their
fellow
citizens
with
even
greater
contempt
than
the
mohammedans
felt
towards
the
giavours
this
aristocracy
is
not
confined
to
pera
but
is
to
be
found
scattered
throughout
the
levant
at
smyrna
and
other
commercial
ports
ignorance
of
the
language
of
the
country
where
they
are
born
is
considered
only
a
proof
of
their
superiority
to
the
other
nations
but
for
their
ignorance
of
all
languages
and
miserable
mongrel
dialect
called
lingua
franca
we
can
find
no
excuse
either
aristocratic
or
diplomatic
this
lingua
franca
is
a
corrupted
dialect
of
the
greek
language
interlarded
with
french
and
italian
and
in
writing
the
roman
characters
are
substituted
for
the
hellenic
as
being
more
distingués
even
family
names
have
been
modified
so
as
to
ignore
any
traces
of
parentage
such
as
sazan
oghlou
into
salsani
and
zipgy
oghlou
into
zipcy
etc
when
the
foreign
ambassadors
first
became
residents
of
pera
as
long
ago
as
the
days
of
suleyman
they
found
this
mixed
people
apparently
a
connecting
link
between
the
east
and
the
west
and
being
themselves
then
ignorant
of
oriental
peculiarities
and
the
languages
of
stamboul
they
were
glad
to
receive
these
perotes
as
employés
dragomans
etc
thus
by
degrees
they
became
a
sort
of
necessary
evil
to
the
foreign
diplomatists
greater
familiarity
with
the
country
and
still
more
a
just
appreciation
of
these
aspirants
to
aristocratic
honors
and
functions
has
however
of
late
years
opened
the
eyes
of
the
foreign
representatives
and
each
embassy
is
now
furnished
with
employés
from
the
home
government
consequently
the
perotes
are
now
decidedly
below
par
adventurers
who
in
their
own
lands
would
never
be
heard
of
in
pera
become
the
guests
of
ambassadors
and
statesmen
and
aping
the
airs
and
manners
of
their
distinguished
patrons
manage
to
pass
current
women
at
every
other
word
murdering
their
mother
tongues
are
transformed
into
ladies
of
quality
in
the
palaces
of
the
representatives
of
their
respective
sovereigns
but
these
are
trifling
matters
the
outcasts
of
european
society
here
find
a
safe
retreat
and
are
even
protected
in
their
outrages
while
the
various
protégés
of
the
different
legations
natives
and
foreigners
constitute
a
privileged
community
russia
has
endeavored
to
increase
her
own
power
by
inducing
the
rayas
to
adopt
her
protection
in
order
to
secure
any
claims
whatever
against
either
turks
or
christians
the
most
desperate
ruffians
of
southern
europe
are
in
turkey
under
british
austrian
french
or
greek
protection
the
english
give
impunity
to

and
maltese
austria
has
her
croats
french
passports
screen
a
crowd
of
levantines
whose
professed
attachment
to
catholicism
is
allowed
to
be
the
cloak
to
any
knavery
while
greece
and
naples
send
a
contingent
whose
character
may
be
easily
imagined
while
the
worst
of
them
have
protection
for
delinquencies
the
whole
enjoy
immunities
of
the
most
unjust
kind
they
can
only
be
sued
in
the
consular
courts
of
their
own
country
they
pay
less
taxes
than
their
neighbors
and
in
some
places
none
at
all
they
are
wholly
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
the
porte
while
for
all
claims
on
the
government
or
on
turkish
subjects
they
can
bring
into
play
the
whole
machinery
of
their
embassy
each
representative
is
almost
bound
to
make
every
private
complaint
an
affair
of
state
and
in
fact
the
real
or
nominal
austrian
briton
or
frenchman
practically
turns
the
diplomatists
of
his
sovereign
into
his
own
special
attorneys
whenever
he
pleases
this
picture
is
not
too
highly
drawn
and
shows
that
if
the
mussulmans
need
reforms
the
nominal
frank
population
are
in
a
somewhat
similar
category
the
effect
which
has
been
produced
upon
the
minds
of
the
osmanlis
by
such
specimens
of
civilized
europeans
has
certainly
not
been
favorable
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
more
extended
intercourse
with
europe
will
counteract
these
influences
the
diplomatic
corps
and
the
perotes
though
the
upper
tendom
and
codfish
aristocracy
of
pera
are
by
no
means
the
greater
part
of
the
population
english
americans
french
germans
greeks
armenians
and
even
moslems
reside
there
preferring
the
bustle
and
public
amusements
which
are
to
be
secured
to
the
quiet
atmosphere
of
stamboul
the
opera
house
and
the
fashionable
emporiums
of
commerce
have
their
attractions
on
a
friday
it
is
amusing
to
see
the
crowds
of
turkish
women
in
the
different
shops
relentlessly
handling
the
merchandize
to
the
infinite
annoyance
of
the
proprietors
themselves
who
are
not
so
patient
as
the
merchants
of
the
bazaars
often
the
most
extravagant
prices
are
paid
for
trifling
articles
of
luxury
by
the
osmanlis
of
wealth
who
even
in
this
sort
of
trade
seem
to
feel
that
everything
à

franca
must
cost
them
dear
the
modistes
have
grown
rich
by
selling
them
feathers
flowers
and
haberdashery
and
the
confiseurs
have
exchanged
their
honeyed
stores
for
bags
of
turkish
gold
there
is
a
great
fondness
for
dress
in
the
population
of
pera
and
the
balls
soirees
and
reunions
are
so
numerous
that
many
shopkeepers
having
reaped
a
rich
harvest
have
retired
from

never
deserted
the
great
rendezvous
for
these
happy
souls
when
their
supremest
efforts
in
outward
adorning
are
accomplished

the

resort

sit
among

the

slowly
moving
towards
the

the
mournful
strains

chapter

the
aristocracy
and
the
people
as
in
every
country
there
ate
two
classes
the
aristocracy
and
the
people
so
in
turkey
there
are
the
kibars
and
the
nass
aristocracy
may
everywhere
be
into
the
aristocracies
of
birth
of
letters
wealth
and
position
in
turkey
all
hereditary
rank
is
vested
solely
in
the
person
of
the
sultan
titles
are
conferred
at
his
sovereign
will
and
pleasure
and
they
do
not
descend
from
father
to
son
there
is
not
therefore
a
regular
or
systematic
aristocracy
and
the
spirit
of
democracy
is
there
very
evident
although
the
osmanlis
hold
all
learning
in
great
respect
yet
turkish
literature
having
hitherto
been
confined
to
the
koran
and
its
commentaries
the
aristocracy
of
letters
has
consequently
been
constituted
by
the
expounders
of
the
faith
who
arrogate
to
themselves
the
modest
appellative
of
ulema
or
savans
nevertheless
the
people
have
the
greatest
reverence
and
consideration
for
zadés
or
those
who
are
the
descendants
of
illustrious
and
enlightened
parents
fait
tout
is
known
and
acknowledged
by
all
the
world
and
wealth
is
everywhere
the
great
highway
to
power
and
distinction
elevating
its
possessor
above
the
common
herd
but
the
love
of
riches
usually
begets
the
love
of
power
for
on
que
riche
on
veut
être
grand
this
is
most
evident
in
a
country
where
the
great
tenure
by
which
individual
wealth
is
preserved
and
personal
respect
commanded
is
official
authority
hence
no
osmanli
is
contented
however
great
his
wealth
without
some
civil
function
by
which
he
can
avert
the
overbearing
disposition
of
his
rivals
indeed
so
great
is
their
ambition
for
supremacy
that
wealth
and
everything
else
is
but
secondary
in
their
estimation
therefore
the
only
aristocracy
in
turkey
is
that
of
wealth
combined
with
position
it
is
not
generally
merit
that
raises
a
man
to
power
in
any
part
of
the
world
but
still
less
in
turkey
no
matter
what
his
previous
avocations
or
utter
ignorance
it
is
supposed
that
when
allah
or
his
proxy
the
padishah
gives
the
office
that
within
the
turban
of
distinction
lie
all
the
sense
and
wit
needed
for
the
post
hence
what
if
the
cobbler
become
the
pasha
or
the
grand
vezir
allah
kerim
this
a
country
where
versatility
of
talent
is
very
remarkable
if
not
great
depth
of
genius
for
one
day
a
man
may
be
head
cook
to
his
majesty
the
next
a
captain
pasha
or
minister
of
finance
thus
are
often
realized
the
tales
of
the
arabian
nights
and
the
humblest
subject
may
dream
of
greatness
and
wake
to
find
himself
a
redjal
or
grandee
of
the
realm
indeed
the
only
real
statesmen
and
true
patriots
may
be
reduced
to
few
individuals
all
told
reshid
aali
fuad
riza
rifaat
and
omer
pashas
besides
those
who
have
been
long
employed
as
servants
of
the
palace
or
have
proved
themselves
cunning
buffoons
or
able
intriguers
are
rewarded
by
some
official
post
instead
of
a
royal
pension
provided
they
are
of
the
faithful
for
elevation
to
office
is
the
privilege
of
the
mussulmans
only
who
considering
themselves
lords
of
the
soil
as
they
are
the
proprietors
are
unwilling
to
consign
their
rights
to
their
rayas
on
the
principle
that
to
the
victors
belong
the
spoils
the
very
existence
of
the
rayas
has
rendered
the
osmanlis
proud
and
arrogant
in
their
peculiar
right
as
mussulmans
and
though
holding
all
high
places
themselves
they
have
been
willing
to
call
in
the
assistance
of
their
subjects
in
secondary
employments
the
rayas
thus
employed
are
of
course
but
a
small
proportion
of
the
whole
to
all
the
rest
life
dwindles
into
a
tinkering
jobbing
affair
this
mushroom
aristocracy
which
was
formerly
ephemeral
like
gourd
springing
suddenly
into
existence
coming
to
maturity
in
an
incredibly
short
space
of
time
then
perishing
ere
the
sun
of
its
glory
arrived
at
meridian
height
has
now
by
virtue
of
the
tanzimat
which
secures
the
enjoyment
of
life
and
property
attained
a
sort
of
permanency
these
officials
being
originally
of
the
people
it
may
be
supposed
would
feel
some
sympathy
for
them
but
the
moment
they
come
into
power
they
become
an
exclusive
class
because
in
turkey
the
patriarchal
idea
that
everything
belongs
to
the
sovereign
has
led
them
to
regard
the
government
as
not
made
for
the
people
but
the
people
for
the
government
they
think
therefore
that
all
advantages
should
accrue
not
to
the
governed
but
to
the
governing
thus
reducing
the
mass
into
the
state
of
individual
nonentities
or
mere
conduits
for
the
resources
of
the
empire
the
persons
in
authority
seek
therefore
only
the
prosperity
of
the
government
and
constitute
as
it
were
a
sort
of
fiscal
administration
rather
than
one
mindful
of
the
good
of
the
commonwealth
hence
whenever
a
project
of
public
utility
is
proposed
the
first
idea
that
crosses
the
mind
of
a
turkish
functionary
is
what
direct
advantage
may
accrue
to
the
government
with
such
perverted
ideas
the
aristocracy
who
are
termed
par
excellence
the
kibars
though
few
in
numbers
are
like
leaven
to
the
whole
mass
domineering
exciting
and
often
corrupting
the
best
materials
and
as
men
are
creatures
of
circumstances
their
moral
and
temporal
conditions
are
but
the
results
of
the
good
or
bad
government
under
which
they
live
the
evils
corruptions
and
miseries
existing
in
a
community
are
not
therefore
to
be
attributed
to
the
mass
indiscriminately
but
rather
to
the
influences
that
surround
them
baluk
bashdan
kokar
is
a
common
proverb
with
the
osmanlis
or
as
is
the
fountain
so
will
be
the
streams
which
flow
from
it
therefore
a
government
which
exercises
its
prerogatives
to
revenge
not
to
punish
to
remove
the
offender
not
to
benefit
others
by
making
an
example
of
him
to
deal
to
all
who
stand
in
the
way
to
encourage
rather
than
study
the
wants
of
the
community
to
prefer
the
intriguant
before
the
patriot
to
patronize
the
buffoon
rather
than
the
statesman
such
a
government
can
not
fail
to
stamp
its
sanguinary
and
arbitrary
character
upon
its
subjects
a
country
where
the
insidious
poison
is
ever
at
hand
and
where
the
innocent
and
infant
who
may
endanger
the
heirs
to
the
throne
is
forced
to
yield
the
life
it
has
but
just
received
in
such
a
land
the
same
scenes
will
be
enacted
in
its
darkest
corners
and
the
peasant
will
mimic
the
lord
as
far
as
he
dares
the
selfish
and
corrupt
principles
of
the
government
have
naturally
had
their
pernicious
effects
upon
all
its
agents
and
through
them
upon
the
people
the
sultan
is
the
great
sun
of
the
system
around
whom
the
many
lesser
orbs
revolve
while
the
pashas
and
dignitaries
are
themselves
planets
of
no
small
lustre
attended
by
innumerable
satellites
of
their
own
the
grandee
holds
the
cable
of
power
upon
which
tremblingly
cling
a
numerous
train
from
its
summit
to
its
lowest
extremity
all
sustained
as
long
as
the
rope
is
firm
all
crushed
when
it
slips
from
the
hand
of
its
supporter
indiscriminate
patronage
being
a
principle
favoritism
and
corruption
become
of
necessity
a
natural
consequence
indifferent
men
are
therefore
raised
to
places
of
trust
to
perform
duties
which
can
never
occupy
their
minds
or
engross
their
intellect
but
the
want
of
money
is
their
first
and
their
keenest
necessity
for
on
que
grand
on
veut
être
riche
est
on
et
grand
et
riche
on
veut
être
plus
grand
et
plus
riche
thus
all
patriotism
is
subverted
and
individual
interest
and
position
are
made
the
sine
quâ
non
of
existence
before
they
were
enervated
by
conquest
and
the
possession
of
vast
tributary
states
which
intoxicated
them
with
sudden
wealth
the
turks
were
brave
in
battle
faithful
to
their
friends
and
generous
to
their
enemies
but
being
inured
to
war
and
excitement
peace
and
tranquillity
only
reduced
them
to
a
state
of
sloth
and
idleness
and
inspired
them
with
conceit
and
arrogance
to
all
around
them
content
with
being
the
lords
of
the
realm
ignorant
and
unfitted
for
the
arts
of
peace
all
their
affairs
were
consigned
to
their
rayas
the
titles
of
vali
pasha
mussellim
were
enjoyed
by
them
while
their
provinces
and
pashaliks
were
either
farmed
out
to
subordinates
or
managed
by
their
armenian
sarafs
or
bankers
who
received
and
disbursed
their
incomes
so
that
the
osmanli
grandee
had
nothing
to
do
but
lounge
listlessly
in
his
keosk
and
puff
his
long
chibouk
varying
his
life
by
occasional
official
visits
to
the
porte
or
in
the
softer
seclusion
of
his
harem
the
enviable
condition
of
indolence
and
the
desire
to
be
surrounded
with
the
trappings
of
wealth
created
a
rivalry
among
them
not
to
attain
high
and
honorable
posts
as
the
champions
of
their
welfare
but
to
ensure
the
means
of
luxury
and
display
and
to
excel
each
other
in
supremacy
hence
they
have
arrived
at
the
acme
of
perfection
in
the
arts
of
adulation
servility
deceit
and
intrigue
real
virtue
is
of
no
avail
where
successful
vice
only
is
admired
and
the
most
insidious
and
faithless
ever
the
favorites
of
fortune
indeed
ingratitude
is
stamped
upon
their
character
for
an
osmanli
raised
to
power
would
turn
the
enemy
even
of
his
patron
should
he
dare
to
cross
his
schemes
this
is
so
proverbial
that
they
have
a
saying
bir
osmanli
bir
piré
itchin
koss
kodja
yorgani
yakar
an
osmanli
would
burn
up
an
entire
coverlet
to
rid
himself
of
a
single
flea
or
in
other
words
no
consideration
would
deter
him
from
any
sacrifice
that
would
promote
his
own
interests
examples
of
which
are
of
daily
occurrence
in
their
political
machinations
in
such
a
malarious
atmosphere
it
would
be
supposed
that
every
moral
virtue
would
perish
and
only
noisome
weeds
choke
the
soil
but
such
is
by
no
means
the
case
as
the
richest
fruits
and
most
fragrant
flowers
often
grow
from
the
very
putrefactions
that
lie
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
so
the
people
in
turkey
surrounded
by
such
a
depraved
and
corrupted
court
are
themselves
often
specimens
of
best
handiwork
the
native
honesty
of
the
turks
is
proverbial
and
in
illustration
thereof
the
following
story
has
been
widely
circulated
an
englishman
having
landed
a
cargo
of
goods
at
one
of
the
in
the
east
was
unwilling
to
leave
them
at
the
wharf
unguarded
when
he
was
told
by
the
officer
that
there
was
no
need
for
apprehension
as
there
was
not
another
englishman
within
fifty
miles
whatever
may
be
the
truth
of
this
statement
it
may
be
observed
that
some
of
the
osmanlis
of
the
present
day
have
so
far
advanced
in
civilization
as
to
even
excel
in
this
respect
their
present
honorable
allies
for
the
idea
that
to
rob
the
treasury
of
the
sultan
is
not
defrauding
the
people
has
led
the
officials
into
all
the
wiles
of
corruption
and
systematic
cheating
so
that
cheating
and
bribery
may
be
considered
as
the
corner
stones
of
this
vast
edifice
in
the
purchase
of
government
supplies
there
is
a
display
of
honesty
on
the
part
of
the
officials
and
also
of
the
european
merchants
who
endeavor
to
underbid
each
other
in
prices
which
may
be
considered
by
an
outsider
as
ruinous
but
on
the
contrary
always
proves
profitable
to
the
in
the
speculation
on
a
certain
occasion
pieces
of
cotton
cloth
were
palmed
off
upon
the
government
by
a
european
merchant
for
pieces
for
which
amount
the
treasury
gave
a
note
such
instances
are
not
of
rare
occurrence
nor
confined
only
to
officials
they
pervade
all
classes
hence
the
scullion
cheats
the
cook
the
cook
the
steward
the
steward
the
master
the
master
the
efendy
the
efendy
the
pasha
and
the
pasha
the
sultan
and
why
not
where
the
strife
for
aggrandizement
and
power
is
so
great
and
the
battle
not
to
the
brave
and
good
but
to
the
wealthy
and
intriguing
there
is
little
or
no
inducement
to
honesty
and
good
faith
russia
seems
to
understand
our
people
better
than
any
other
europeans
owing
perhaps
to
her
natural
proximity
also
since
a
fellow
feeling
makes
us
kind
she
knew
where
to
touch
the
sensitive
osmanlis
when
she
provided
prince
menschikoff
on
his
late
mission
to
constantinople
with
a
surplus
fund
of
paul
imperials
or
over
a
million
of
dollars
it
is
not
however
only
in
turkey
that
bribery
and
corruption
prevail
even
europe
france
and
england
the
very
centres
of
civilization
have
furnished
sad
examples
of
personal
aggrandizement
under
the
garb
of
patriotism
nevertheless
it
is
eminently
true
that
those
of
the
people
who
have
retained
their
primitive
simplicity
are
truly
honest
and
confiding
while
others
have
become
contaminated
by
the
corruption
of
the
court
and
the
grasping
spirit
of
european
adventurers
many
of
the
peasants
remove
to
the
metropolis
with
the
hope
of
bettering
their
condition
some
of
them
become
hamals
or
porters
tellaks
or
attendants
of
the
baths
cayikjys
or
boatmen
common
laborers
venders
in
general
and
others
domestics
in
private
houses
a
certain
armenian
native
of
van
immediately
upon
his
arrival
in
constantinople
was
engaged
as
a
scullion
in
course
of
time
he
complained
to
his
companions
that
he
was
not
doing
a
good
business
on
such
a
salary
as
he
received
and
he
wondered
at
their
apparent
prosperity
his
simplicity
was
of
course
ridiculed
at
first
and
through
compassion
he
was
initiated
into
the
tricks
of
the
trade
he
was
told
that
he
must
always
add
to
his
account
the
customary
khamin
of
or
per
a
technical
term
expressing
overcharge
or
cheating
not
understood
by
novices
so
the
next
day
when
this
simple
son
of
armenia
presented
his
account
to
his
master
at
the
foot
of
the
bill
there
was
an
item
which
seemed
not
quite
intelligible
to
him
he
therefore
called
for
an
explanation
when
the
servant
in
all
his
native
simplicity
informed
him
that
that
item
was
the
khamin
or
the
sum
total
of
his
cheating
which
his
companions
assured
him
was
customary
and
allowed
to
all
servants
in
their
daily
purchases
how
fortunate
and
consoling
it
would
be
if
instead
of
being
drugged
in
small
doses
we
could
thus
be
informed
of
the
sum
total
of
all
the
cheatings
to
which
we
are
subjected
the
most
unlimited
confidence
is
stamped
upon
all
their
reciprocal
transactions
and
they
intrust
each
other
with
any
amount
of
goods
without
demanding
a
receipt
check
or
counter
check
in
the
exercise
of
their
avocation
as
hamals
they
are
often
intrusted
with
bags
of
money
untold
they
are
generally
the
watchmen
or
guardians
to
the
stores
and
mercantile
houses
of
the
franks
and
in
any
deficiency
or
robbery
their
character
and
integrity
are
never
questioned
or
suspected
the
osmanlis
possess
the
domestic
virtues
of
kindness
and
affection
in
a
remarkable
degree
their
love
of
offspring
is
very
great
and
their
patient
endurance
of
the
whims
and
caprices
of
their
women
quite
exemplary
merhamet
or
compassion
is
an
essential
component
in
their
character
and
induces
them
to
extend
a
most
unlimited
patronage
even
to
the
lower
orders
of
creation
hence
the
streets
in
turkey
swarm
with
dogs
the
roofs
of
the
houses
with
cats
and
the
domes
of
the
mosques
with
venerated
pigeons
which
one
and
all
are
objects
of
special
charity
the
thousands
of
cayiks
that
ply
up
and
down
the
bosphorus
acting
as
aquatic
omnibuses
besides
their
designated
load
of
passengers
make
a
point
to
carry
one
or
more
boys
gratuitously
as
an
act
of
charity
and
how
astonished
would
they
be
at
the
cry
of
cut
behind
which
so
often
greets
the
ears
of
beggars
in
more
eminent
christian
lands
who
mistaking
wishes
for
horses
might
otherwise
chance
to
ride
yet
a
turk
is
a
singular
being
apparently
composed
of
contrarieties
of
savage
traits
as
well
as
domestic
virtues
and
this
contrariety
is
to
be
attributed
solely
to
his
fanaticism
social
and
humane
until
you
touch
his
religious
prejudices
when
he
becomes
implacable
it
has
been
the
interest
of
the
clergy
to
nurture
a
fanatical
conceit
by
which
the
great
principle
of
human
nature
has
well
sustained
and
the
mussulmans
been
led
to
consider
themselves
the
very
salt
of
the
earth
and
the
rest
of
the
human
family
as
contemptible
giavours
hence
they
will
not
honor
a
christian
with
the
mohammedan
salutation
selamin
aleküm
pax
vobiscum
nor
will
they
observe
any
one
in
the
company
until
they
have
looked
for
a
true
believer
to
whom
however
humble
he
may
be
is
offered
the
arabic
or
orthodox
salutation
and
on
the
christians
present
however
great
in
their
own
estimation
will
afterwards
be
bestowed
as
their
due
a
simple
olsoon
or
good
morning
in
plain
turkish
though
they
have
been
subdued
into
a
certain
degree
of
external
deference
by
the
progress
of
civilization
yet
in
the
exchange
of
social
etiquettes
there
is
always
a
meaning
slight
cast
upon
their
unbelieving
friends
which
is
well
understood
and
appreciated
among
themselves
even
the
humblest
mohammedan
will
appropriate
to
himself
the
best
position
in
a
public
conveyance
or
in
any
promiscuous
assembly
considering
himself
as
fully
entitled
to
such
privileges
by
the
simple
guarantee
of
his
faith
which
elevates
him
above
all
humanity
in
the
medical
school
where
some
of
the
scholars
belong
to
the
families
of
the
rayas
this
mussulman
conceit
is
most
evident
and
even
tolerated
and
encouraged
by
the
government
at
the
present
day
for
regardless
of
actual
merit
it
has
hitherto
been
a
principle
with
the
faculty
always
to
place
a
mussulman
boy
at
the
head
of
the
class
it
may
be
a
matter
of
wonder
to
see
such
bigoted
characters
adopting
the
very
garb
of
the
contemptible
giavours
but
the
change
of
costume
was
effected
by
the
invincible
mahmoud
who
to
liberate
his
people
from
the
thraldom
of
the
janissaries
and
the
superstitions
of
darker
ages
feared
neither
priest
or
koran
and
at
all
hazards
resolved
to
make
a
daring
stride
towards
civilization
and
reform
therefore
this
change
of
costume
was
not
effected
through
any
relaxation
of
religious
bigotry
but
by
the
force
of
the
supreme
power
of
the
sultan
and
the
ulema
themselves
were
obliged
to
compromise
by
wearing
a
fez
with
a
simple
turban
around
it
with
some
other
slight
modification
of
their
flowing
robes
reform
in
dress
having
become
an
essential
principle
of
the
government
those
connected
with
the
court
and
all
public
officers
were
obliged
to
conform
to
the
established
style
and
the
young
élégans
of
stamboul
now
vie
with
the
parisian
exquisites
in
their
recherchées
toilettes
but
beyond
the
circle
of
court
etiquette
and
fashion
the
artisans
and
peasants
still
preserve
all
the
varieties
of
costumes
identified
with
orientalism
religious
fanaticism
in
the
east
is
not
confined
to
the
mussulmans
alone
it
seems
to
have
a
universal
sway
in
this
climate
pervading
every
community
the
mussulman
would
feel
callous
at
the
sight
of
the
decapitation
of
a
christian
and
a
christian
would
experience
a
secret
exultation
at
the
death
of
a
mussulman
some
years
ago
i
had
the
misfortune
to
meet
with
an
accident
my
carriage
was
lost
in
the
bosphorus
and
my
horse
and
hostler
were
drowned
near
the
spot
of
this
occurrence
there
was
a
greek
coaster
lying
at
anchor
and
the
sailors
soon
came
to
my
call
for
assistance
but
perceiving
that
the
drowning
man
was
dressed
in
turkish
costume
and
taking
him
for
a
mussulman
they
instinctively
exclaimed
tourkos
eine
tourkos
eine
he
is
a
turk
he
is
a
turk
left
him
to
his
sad
fate
it
was
in
vain
that
i
proclaimed
that
he
was
a
greek
and
of
their
own
the
mussulman
is
fanatical
because
he
has
thereby
been
goaded
on
to
victory
and
attributes
all
his
successes
to
the
banner
of
the
prophet
and
the
christian
is
bigoted
because
his
religion
is
the
only
thing
left
him
his
church
is
the
cradle
of
his
superstitions
and
the
badge
of
his
nationality
even
a
turk
designates
his
nationality
by
his
religion
for
if
you
ask
him
of
what
nation
are
you
his
answer
will
invariably
be
mussulmanem
or
thank
god
i
am
a
mussulman
indeed
religion
in
the
east
is
so
that
a
declaration
of
faith
is
equal
to
an
allegiance
of
fealty
and
the
mohammedan
formula
of
is
the
only
oath
of
naturalization
which
if
once
pronounced
fully
entitles
the
individual
to
all
the
privileges
and
immunities
of
turkish
citizenship
neither
is
there
a
community
of
sentiment
among
the
christians
themselves
who
all
abhorring
islamism
hate
none
the
less
each
other
through
their
religious
differences
an
armenian
native
of
angora
whose
inhabitants
are
reputed
for
their
religious
bigotry
and
a
roman
catholic
by
persuasion
had
occasion
to
visit
trieste
on
some
commercial
business
on
his
arrival
there
he
was
asked
by
the
officer
of
the
quarantine
what
nation
he
belonged
to
his
unsophistical
and
prompt
answer
was
catholic
the
officer
somewhat
puzzled
at
this
novel
nationality
reminded
him
that
they
were
also
all
catholics
there
but
called
themselves
austrians
or
italians
now
what
is
your
nation
thereupon
our
worthy
friend
unflinchingly
reiterated
that
he
was
a
catholic
nothing
else
but
a
catholic
for
they
now
had
through
the
interference
of
the
french
ambassador
a
patriarch
of
their
own
and
were
recognized
as
a
nation
meaning
a
community
if
a
greek
mendicant
happen
to
call
at
your
door
and
you
ask
his
who
it
is
his
answer
will
surely
be
christianos
or
a
christian
but
if
the
applicant
for
charity
should
chance
to
be
of
any
other
creed
his
only
title
would
be
ztiyanos
or
beggar
apart
from
the
religious
fanaticism
which
is
universal
the
people
uncontaminated
by
a
depraved
and
corrupted
court
unlike
the
enervated
and
luxurious
osmanlis
of
the
metropolis
are
brave
robust
temperate
intelligent
active
and
industrious
the
mussulmans
formerly
taught
that
apostasy
should
be
punished
with
death
but
now
a
new
system
of
instruction
on
this
and
other
points
proceeding
from
supreme
authority
is
as
readily
received
by
the
credulous
multitude
their
bravery
has
been
attested
by
the
late
massacre
of
sinope
when
one
and
all
preferred
death
to
an
ignominious
surrender
the
events
of
the
recent
war
have
established
the
fact
that
there
are
no
better
soldiers
than
the
turks
we
have
the
testimony
of
a
distinguished
american
who
stood
among
them
but
not
of
them
he
says
that
we
had
an
agreeable
conversation
with
general
omar
pasha
staff
surgeon
among
other
things
he
said
the
turks
had
long
been
extremely
anxious
to
unite
with
their
allies
in
a
direct
assault
upon
sebastopol
i
was
somewhat
surprised
at
this
intimation
knowing
their
considerate
nature
and
general
inclination
to
conservative
views
yet
notwithstanding
they
have
been
accused
of
cowardice
for
the
desertion
of
the
batteries
daring
the
battle
of
balaklava
which
could
not
well
have
been
avoided
under
the
circumstances
the
triumphs
of
silistria
tchetate
and
kars
afford
ample
refutation
of
such
calumnies
the
orientals
are
strong
and
athletic
men
capable
of
enduring
the
greatest
bodily
fatigue
the
hamals
or
porters
both
mussulman
and
armenian
have
been
known
to
carry
on
their
backs
immense
weights
and
one
of
these
oriental
hercules
has
been
seen
carrying
on
a
wager
a
load
of
no
less
than
a
thousand
pounds
to
a
distance
of
a
quarter
of
a
mile
the
heavier
hardens
are
suspended
from
long
poles
the
number
of
which
increases
in
proportion
to
the
weight
and
when
the
contents
are
of
glassware
instead
of
being
marked
fragile
a
full
size
representation
of
a
bottle
is
painted
upon
the
package
the
ends
of
these
poles
rest
on
the
shoulders
of
the
hamals
and
they
walk
in
a
steady
and
measured
step
one
of
them
once
accidentally
slipped
and
fell
and
the
end
of
the
pole
striking
him
on
the
chest
he
became
senseless
his
companions
raised
him
up
whilst
one
of
their
number
stood
back
to
back
with
the
injured
man
and
locking
his
arms
within
those
of
his
comrade
repeatedly
raised
him
from
the
ground
thus
expanding
the
chest
until
he
recovered
his
breath
when
to
the
astonishment
of
the
bystanders
the
man
after
taking
one
or
two
long
inspirations
smiling
at
the
funny
incident
shouldered
his
pole
and
marched
on
as
if
nothing
had
happened
these
very
men
live
habitually
on
the
simplest
diet
consisting
of
the
coarsest
brown
bread
in
the
middle
of
which
they
make
a
cavity
and
fill
it
with
equal
proportions
of
olive
oil
and
molasses
and
it
is
really
a
pleasure
to
see
them
enjoy
their
simple
meals
with
a
relish
that
would
kill
all
dyspepsia
doctors
from
sheer
envy
the
native
intelligence
of
the
people
is
evinced
by
their
aptitude
in
acquiring
the
arts
of
civilized
life
for
after
a
residence
of
a
couple
of
years
in
the
metropolis
the
rudest
peasants
become
accomplished
soldiers
and
skillful
artisans
the
facility
with
which
they
have
adapted
themselves
to
the
european
style
of
music
is
very
remarkable
and
certainly
implies
much
talent
or
cleverness
indeed
many
of
those
who
have
risen
to
the
higher
ranks
of
society
evince
no
signs
in
their
general
deportment
of
plebeian
origin
save
the
peculiar
brogue
of
local
rusticity
nothing
is
more
erroneous
and
unjust
than
the
idea
that
the
orientals
are
indolent
or
inactive
the
tabys
or
garçons
of
the
kahvés
even
excel
their
parisian
competitors
in
alertness
and
general
ubiquity
serving
scores
of
customers
at
once
with
coffee
chibouk
and
narghillés
the
boatmen
who
transport
the
pashas
and
others
to
their
homes
after
the
adjourning
of
the
porte
and
closing
of
the
bazaars
delight
to
compete
with
each
other
in
speed
and
linger
on
their
course
until
they
meet
with
an
antagonist
when
the
race
sometimes
extends
the
whole
length
of
the
bosphorus
their
sports
and
national
games
consisting
of
horsemanship
wrestling
chasing
cricket
etc
all
tend
to
show
their
love
of
activity
there
is
none
of
the
bustle
or
american
in
the
oriental
character
and
habits
none
of
that
nervous
excitement
which
has
so
much
the
air
of
great
progress
too
often
like
the
whirlwind
among
the
natural
elements
creating
prodigies
of
human
noise
and
commotion
which
subside
and
leave
no
sign
or
it
may
be
only
havoc
and
destruction
in
all
the
machineries
of
eastern
life
public
or
domestic
steady
and
quiet
perseverance
rules
the
motion
the
oil
of
gentleness
falling
drop
by
drop
upon
the
rolling
wheels
suffices
for
the
friction
while
in
the
land
of
modern
adventure
by
increasing
the
pressure
to
a
tremendous
degree
the
whole
structure
is
often
crushed
to
atoms
this
giddy
rushing
to
a
certain
point
is
too
apt
to
wear
out
human
energy
and
most
surely
annihilates
which
is
the
keystone
to
success
leave
then
we
say
the
oriental
sometimes
to
sit
amid
the
fumes
of
his
favorite
chibouk
for
while
external
things
are
beclouded
often
a
mighty
scheme
is
in
conception
and
the
sunshine
of
matured
judgment
suddenly
bursts
upon
the
dim
atmosphere
in
full
power
and
glory
ready
to
fructify
and
yield
all
manner
of
increase
the
apparent
idleness
which
some
persons
have
attributed
to
the
natives
of
this
country
is
more
the
effect
of
a
spirit
of
resignation
to
external
circumstances
than
of
a
desire
to
be
unemployed
taking
for
a
basis
the
idea
that
the
interest
of
the
people
is
but
secondary
and
under
the
pretence
of
increasing
the
revenue
of
the
country
and
thus
benefiting
the
state
as
it
were
but
with
the
secret
hope
of
all
advantageous
projects
are
seized
upon
by
the
officials
thus
an
effectual
check
is
thrown
upon
all
private
and
public
enterprise
the
writer
was
the
first
to
propose
to
the
turkish
government
the
establishment
of
a
railroad
from
the
capital
to
adrianople
not
succeeding
in
this
a
line
of
post
coaches
was
suggested
for
which
after
great
exertion
a
firman
was
granted
but
no
sooner
were
the
advantages
of
the
project
understood
than
several
persons
in
authority
began
to
intrigue
until
they
succeeded
in
appropriating
the
firman
to
themselves
which
had
been
obtained
at
so
much
expense
and
toil
by
another
but
as
usual
it
proved
to
them
more
ruinous
than
profitable
because
of
the
numerous
contenders
for
the
spoils
no
internal
improvements
are
dreamt
of
and
no
motive
left
for
speculation
and
as
there
is
no
mutual
confidence
between
the
government
and
the
people
the
formation
of
corporate
companies
which
require
united
action
is
out
of
the
question
or
if
attempted
they
are
sure
to
fall
through
by
official
exactions
thus
a
country
teeming
with
mines
and
minerals
is
left
unexplored
and
all
other
internal
resources
lie
dormant
some
attempts
have
of
late
been
made
by
the
government
at
internal
improvements
such
as
the
from
trebizond
to
erzuroum
but
the
of
those
intrusted
with
the
work
soon
exhausted
the
appropriations
and
the
road
was
but
half
completed
the
coal
mines
at
heraclea
have
shared
a
similar
fate
indeed
no
undertaking
can
be
prosperous
in
the
lands
of
the
officials
and
if
any
such
privilege
be
granted
to
private
individuals
it
is
invariably
under
the
patronage
of
some
grandee
a
permission
was
obtained
from
government
by
an
individual
to
light
the
streets
of
pera
in
the
course
of
six
months
the
lamps
were
demolished
by
the
citizens
because
they
were
heavily
taxed
to
fill
the
pockets
of
the
speculator
without
any
advantage
to
themselves
the
streets
for
the
most
part
being
as
dark
as
before
all
innovations
are
therefore
in
disrepute
not
that
they
are
not
appreciated
but
because
they
invariably
prove
to
be
mere
schemes
for
individual
advantage
and
never
pro
bono
publico
hence
it
is
also
that
the
streets
even
in
the
metropolis
are
ill
paved
filthy
and
not
lighted
each
person
carrying
his
own
lantern
and
getting
along
as
best
he
can
public
enterprise
being
at
so
low
an
ebb
a
spirit
of
indifference
pervades
the
country
and
if
you
once
pass
the
aristocracy
the
actual
necessities
of
the
community
are
but
few
they
have
no
idea
therefore
of
bettering
their
condition
if
you
offer
them
any
new
invention
they
admire
its
ingenuity
and
dryly
tell
you
they
have
no
need
of
it
consequently
there
is
no
need
of
patent
rights
for
new
inventions
this
indifference
is
not
to
be
construed
into
a
love
of
inactivity
but
is
rather
the
result
of
selfishness
each
man
interests
being
circumscribed
by
the
sphere
in
which
he
moves
in
case
of
any
emergency
they
are
most
indefatigable
and
persevering
it
needs
only
to
cite
the
fact
that
pera
one
of
the
suburbs
of
the
city
has
in
the
course
of
twenty
years
been
destroyed
by
fire
four
times
and
entirely
rebuilt
by
native
industry
indeed
inactivity
is
against
the
spirit
of
the
country
for
there
there
are
no
rentiers
but
every
one
must
have
a
calling
even
the
sultan
is
traditionally
supposed
to
belong
to
the
trade
since
the
abolition
of
capital
and
summary
punishments
and
the
monopolies
by
the
promulgation
of
of
the
tanzimat
which
was
an
attempt
at
reformation
not
without
some
beneficial
results
a
new
impulse
has
been
given
to
the
activity
of
the
population
in
a
word
give
but
the
necessary
impetus
and
as
much
genuine
may
be
found
in
turkey
as
in
itself
with
such
a
population
and
so
many
internal
resources
it
may
be
deemed
a
matter
of
wonder
that
this
empire
should
be
in
so
ruinous
a
condition
chapter
xl
the
future
of
turkey
the
survey
that
has
been
taken
of
the
turkish
empire
political
and
social
will
furnish
the
component
parts
of
this
wonderful
structure
of
human
power
and
religious
fanaticism
owing
to
the
remarkable
sway
attained
by
the
sword
of
the
prophet
the
various
ingredients
mingled
by
the
power
of
conquest
have
all
been
brought
together
like
so
many
antagonistic
elements
to
be
wrought
into
some
degree
of
unity
of
spirit
and
purpose
and
to
be
rendered
subservient
to
one
great
potentate
absolute
and
despotic
the
dread
power
of
the
turk
ravaging
and
has
only
of
late
years
ceased
to
inspire
terror
to
the
world
in
general
and
to
hold
in
trembling
awe
the
subjects
over
which
it
domineered
suddenly
the
dark
cloud
of
barbarism
began
to
disperse
from
this
vast
clime
of
the
orient
as
mahmoud
seizing
the
torch
of
civilization
scattered
the
light
of
science
and
reform
over
the
land
ever
since
his
day
the
struggling
beams
of
knowledge
and
truth
have
been
casting
a
mistlike
glow
over
these
dominions
sometimes
almost
bursting
into
a
blaze
of
brightness
and
again
subsiding
into
the
obscurity
of
olden
times
and
religions
bigotry
the
principles
of
progress
and
the
maintenance
of
ancient
and
long
established
usages
were
now
at
war
the
former
supported
by
the
portion
of
the
people
and
the
latter
by
the
formidable
body
of
the
ulema
or
the
mohammedan
clergy
the
rayas
or
christian
subjects
hitherto
quiescent
and
despairing
now
saw
the
star
of
hope
and
comparative
liberty
in
their
horizon
and
were
ready
to
grasp
at
any
straw
of
deliverance
from
the
storms
of
oppression
and
tyranny
the
mass
is
in
commotion
mussulman
power
trembles
at
the
vision
of
the
emancipation
of
its
victims
oppressed
and
suffering
humanity
even
dares
to
utter
one
vast
groan
and
to
raise
a
furtive
glance
towards
the
glorious
temple
of
liberty
and
the
equality
of
man
with
man
mahmoud
the
bold
champion
of
his
country
is
surrounded
by
intrigues
both
foreign
and
domestic
and
becomes
entangled
in
the
web
of
turbulence
and
opposition
until
his
soul
can
endure
no
longer
and
wings
its
flight
from
the
terrible
field
of
battle
but
the
iron
gates
of
barbarism
had
been
unlocked
and
even
the
extreme
youth
of
the
succeeding
sultan
bringing
with
him
a
sort
of
regency
could
not
refasten
the
heavy
bolts
thus
we
find
this
empire
only
advancing
in
progress
the
more
wonderful
since
there
has
been
comparatively
so
little
reform
in
the
actual
government
even
the
sultan
has
abrogated
his
absolute
and
despotic
sway
the
once
powerful
viceroy
still
sits
at
his
right
hand
but
no
longer
unfettered
and
the
various
religious
and
civil
functionaries
although
the
same
as
the
creatures
of
yesterday
are
themselves
amenable
to
the
tribunal
of
justice
and
reform
where
the
spirit
of
mahmoud
seems
to
linger
as
a
reproving
and
condemning
monitor
the
opposing
influences
to
all
innovations
were
strong
the
very
soil
rank
with
bigotry
conceit
and
prejudice
and
the
powers
in
actual
possession
of
the
commonwealth
and
cunning
hitherto
a
comparative
isolation
had
created
natural
walls
within
which
despotism
had
its
unmitigated
sway
but
as
distance
became
annihilated
throughout
the
world
dominions
as
oceans
dwindled
into
lakes
rivers
into
little
rills
and
broad
acres
into
mere
pleasure
gardens
before
the
mighty
achievements
of
modern
invention
all
natural
barriers
disappeared
as
in
ancient
times
the
walls
of
the
great
city
of
jericho
fell
at
the
blast
of
the
trumpets
of
joshua
no
sooner
did
the
echoes
of
the
shrill
whistle
of
the
mighty
steamship
reverberate
along
the
shores
and
among
the
seven
hills
of
stamboul
than
were
annihilated
the
frontiers
of
a
barbarous
and
spiritual
despotism
in
the
stronghold
of
the
mussulmans
civilization
from
europe
was
no
longer
stayed
but
boldly
stepped
into
this
natural
garden
of
the
world
to
stem
the
current
would
be
to
perish
in
an
overwhelming
vortex
and
the
very
government
was
obliged
to
conform
to
compromise
and
to
make
treaties
of
peace
with
this
new
element
social
and
political
progress
not
only
in
turkey
but
universally
the
spirit
of
domination
has
been
until
the
march
of
human
improvement
awakened
the
community
to
a
sense
of
their
own
power
and
individual
rights
thus
the
elements
of
democracy
have
been
arrayed
in
opposition
to
the
oppressions
of
despotism
threatening
its
utter
annihilation
and
forcing
the
ruling
powers
to
terms
of
capitulation
the
reformation
checked
the
authority
of
the
pope
a
charter
was
granted
to
the
english
and
their
colonies
in
america
soon
grew
to
a
great
and
independent
state
though
the
european
states
can
not
boast
of
that
degree
of
independence
they
have
ofttimes
struggled
for
yet
their
rulers
and
potentates
have
ever
been
and
are
still
forced
to
don
the
mantle
of
liberty
and
maintain
the
guise
of
justice
in
their
various
administrations
thus
proving
the
supremacy
of
the
spirit
of
democracy
but
despotism
fostered
in
the
bosom
of
the
little
dukedom
of
moscow
has
maintained
its
unbroken
sway
and
spread
over
the
vast
territories
now
known
as
the
russian
dominions
it
has
engulphed
finland
crimea
poland
bessarabia
circassia
georgia
and
many
other
provinces
and
by
its
continued
and
systematic
encroachments
upon
turkey
even
threatened
to
overwhelm
europe
itself
local
circumstances
have
combined
to
favor
her
designs
and
render
her
aggressions
successful
the
remarkable
spirit
of
mohammedan
fanaticism
led
the
turks
on
to
conquest
the
neighboring
countries
were
all
subjugated
until
the
thirst
for
war
enticed
them
into
europe
where
victory
still
followed
their
banner
but
the
very
nations
that
they
conquered
many
of
whom
were
induced
by
force
or
otherwise
to
make
their
abode
in
the
turkish
dominions
tended
by
degrees
to
undermine
their
power
with
them
came
various
religions
and
creeds
conflicting
with
each
other
and
creating
the
bitterest
animosities
apart
from
this
the
vast
extent
of
their
territories
without
any
of
the
modern
facilities
of
intercourse
rendered
the
empire
unmanageable
by
an
unenlightened
and
barbarous
government
the
army
was
numerous
and
powerful
but
turbulent
and
refractory
usurping
the
power
of
governing
to
themselves
as
attests
the
well
known
history
of
the
janissaries
who
could
only
be
subdued
by
the
bold
daring
of
the
illustrious
mahmoud
a
new
army
was
organized
on
european
principles
and
various
civil
reforms
attempted
but
without
any
beneficial
result
for
the
neighboring
nations
especially
the
formidable
power
of
russia
the
inveterate
enemy
of
turkey
were
anxiously
regarding
the
waning
decline
of
ottoman
supremacy
russia
who
never
missed
an
opportunity
to
expedite
the
rain
of
this
rival
empire
has
at
various
times
waged
war
upon
the
most
trifling
pretexts
upon
the
termination
of
the
greek
insurrection
and
immediately
after
the
destruction
of
the
janissaries
a
most
aggressive
and
iniquitous
war
was
commenced
in
which
the
european
powers
acted
as
sleeping
partners
the
albanian
servian
egyptian
and
kürdish
rebellions
were
each
successively
instigated
by
russian
and
austrian
emissaries
or
secret
agents
until
the
whole
country
became
the
arena
of
party
intrigue
and
the
direst
confusion
thus
realizing
the
plans
of
its
enemy
and
rendering
it
an
easy
prey
to
moscovite
cunning
to
europe
now
awakened
to
a
sense
of
her
own
impending
danger
the
division
of
turkey
seemed
the
only
alternative
since
that
empire
showed
evident
symptoms
of
decay
and
inability
to
resist
so
powerful
an
enemy
as
russia
reshid
pasha
one
of
the
ablest
and
oldest
statesmen
and
a
true
patriot
was
at
this
time
in
europe
as
representative
of
the
porte
on
hearing
of
this
proposed
division
of
his
country
he
hastened
home
to
offer
his
counsels
to
the
young
sultan
who
had
just
ascended
the
throne
by
his
representations
and
suggestions
his
majesty
was
induced
to
issue
a
proclamation
called
the
tanzimat
or
reformation
by
which
it
was
hoped
that
the
country
would
be
regenerated
and
the
world
convinced
that
turkey
could
maintain
itself
the
tanzimat
translated
from
the
turkish
in
the
former
days
of
the
ottoman
empire
as
every
one
knows
the
glorious
precepts
of
the
koran
and
the
laws
of
the
monarchy
were
universally
observed
and
consequently
the
empire
increased
both
in
power
and
size
and
all
subjects
without
exception
attained
the
highest
degree
of
ease
and
prosperity
for
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
a
succession
of
accidents
and
of
divers
causes
have
put
an
end
to
this
obedience
to
the
sacred
code
of
the
laws
and
to
the
rules
which
spring
from
it
and
our
former
power
and
prosperity
have
been
changed
into
weakness
and
poverty
for
an
empire
loses
all
stability
when
the
laws
cease
to
be
observed
these
considerations
are
constantly
present
to
our
mind
and
from
the
day
of
our
accession
to
the
throne
the
idea
of
the
public
welfare
the
amelioration
of
the
state
of
the
provinces
and
condolence
with
the
people
have
been
its
sole
occupations
now
when
we
consider
the
geographical
position
of
the
ottoman
empire
the
fertility
of
the
soil
the
aptitude
and
intelligence
of
the
inhabitants
we
are
convinced
that
by
applying
ourselves
to
discover
suitable
means
the
result
which
by
the
aid
of
god
we
hope
to
attain
may
be
obtained
in
the
space
of
a
few
years
thus
then
full
of
confidence
in
the
most
high
and
relying
upon
the
intercession
of
our
prophet
we
have
judged
proper
to
seek
by
new
institutions
to
procure
for
the
provinces
composing
the
ottoman
empire
the
benefit
of
a
good
administration
these
institutions
must
bear
principally
upon
three
points
to
wit
the
pledges
which
insure
to
our
subjects
a
perfect
security
of
life
honor
and
fortune
a
regular
mode
of
assessing
and
levying
the
taxes
a
mode
equally
regular
for
the
levy
of
soldiers
and
the
duration
of
the
service
and
are
not
life
and
honor
truly
the
most
precious
goods
which
exist
what
man
however
base
his
situation
if
his
character
adapt
him
for
violence
could
be
prevented
from
having
recourse
to
it
and
thus
doing
injury
to
his
government
and
the
country
if
his
life
and
honor
are
endangered
if
on
the
contrary
he
enjoys
in
this
respect
a
perfect
security
he
will
not
wander
from
the
paths
of
loyalty
and
all
his
acts
will
concur
to
the
prosperity
of
the
government
and
of
his
brethren
if
his
fortune
be
not
secured
to
him
each
remains
cold
to
the
voice
of
the
prince
and
the
country
no
one
is
occupied
with
the
progress
of
public
fortune
absorbed
as
every
one
must
be
in
his
own
inquietudes
but
if
on
the
other
hand
the
citizen
possess
in
confidence
his
property
of
every
kind
then
full
of
ardor
in
his
business
the
circle
of
which
he
seeks
to
enlarge
in
order
to
extend
that
of
his
pleasure
he
finds
each
day
redoubled
in
his
heart
the
love
of
his
prince
and
country
and
devotion
to
her
cause
these
sentiments
become
in
him
the
source
of
the
most
praiseworthy
actions
as
to
the
regular
assessment
and
establishment
of
the
taxes
it
is
very
important
that
this
matter
should
be
regulated
for
the
state
that
is
driven
to
various
expenses
for
the
defense
of
its
territory
can
procure
the
money
necessary
for
its
armies
and
other
services
only
by
the
contributions
levied
upon
the
subjects
although
thanks
be
to
god
those
of
our
empire
have
for
some
time
been
delivered
from
the
scourge
of
monopolies
improperly
regarded
in
former
times
as
a
source
of
revenue
an
injurious
custom
still
exists
and
which
can
not
but
have
disastrous
consequences
i
mean
that
practice
of
venal
concession
known
as
the
iltizam
by
this
system
the
civil
and
financial
administration
of
a
locality
is
delivered
to
the
arbitration
of
a
single
man
and
sometimes
to
the
iron
hand
of
the
most
violent
and
base
passions
for
if
this
farmer
of
the
revenue
be
not
good
he
will
only
have
regard
to
his
own
advantage
it
is
requisite
then
that
this
time
forward
each
individual
of
the
ottoman
society
be
taxed
his
quota
of
his
established
impost
in
the
ratio
of
his
fortune
and
possessions
and
nothing
farther
can
be
required
of
him
special
laws
too
must
fix
and
limit
the
expenses
of
our
armies
by
sea
and
land
although
as
we
have
said
the
defense
of
our
common
country
is
an
important
matter
and
although
it
is
the
duty
of
all
the
inhabitants
to
furnish
soldiers
to
that
effect
laws
must
now
be
established
to
regulate
the
proportion
that
each
locality
shall
furnish
upon
the
necessity
of
the
moment
and
to
reduce
to
four
or
five
years
the
term
of
military
service
for
it
is
both
acting
unjustly
and
giving
a
death
blow
to
agriculture
and
industry
to
take
without
regard
to
the
respective
population
of
the
districts
from
one
more
and
from
another
fewer
than
they
can
supply
while
it
reduces
the
soldiers
to
despair
and
contributes
to
the
depopulation
of
the
country
to
retain
them
all
their
in
the
service
to
resume
without
these
different
laws
the
necessity
for
which
we
have
just
seen
the
empire
can
possess
neither
power
riches
happiness
nor
tranquillity
while
all
these
blessings
may
be
obtained
from
the
existence
of
the
new
laws
therefore
from
this
time
forward
the
cause
of
every
accused
will
be
publicly
judged
conformably
to
our
own
divine
law
after
thorough
inquest
and
examination
and
so
long
as
the
regular
judgment
is
not
interrupted
no
one
will
be
able
in
secret
or
in
public
to
put
another
to
death
by
poison
or
any
other
punishment
no
one
will
be
permitted
to
attaint
the
honor
of
another
each
individual
will
possess
his
property
of
every
kind
and
will
dispose
of
it
with
the
most
entire
liberty
without
the
opposition
of
any
one
thus
for
example
the
property
of
a
criminal
shall
not
be
confiscated
to
his
innocent
heirs
these
imperial
concessions
extending
to
all
our
subjects
of
whatever
religion
or
sect
they
may
be
shall
by
them
be
enjoyed
without
exception
a
perfect
security
is
thus
granted
by
us
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
empire
in
their
lives
honor
and
fortunes
as
the
sacred
text
of
our
law
demands
upon
all
other
points
as
they
must
be
regulated
by
the
agreement
of
enlightened
opinion
our
council
of
justice
augmented
by
new
members
when
it
shall
be
necessary
to
which
will
be
joined
on
certain
days
by
us
appointed
our
ministers
and
the
notables
of
the
empire
will
assemble
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
regular
laws
for
the
security
of
life
and
fortune
and
the
imposition
of
taxes
in
these
assemblies
each
man
will
freely
express
his
ideas
and
give
his
opinion
the
laws
for
the
regulation
of
the
military
service
will
be
fixed
by
the
military
council
to
hold
its
sessions
at
the
palace
of
the
seraskier
as
soon
as
a
law
is
fixed
to
be
forever
available
and
executory
it
shall
be
presented
to
us
and
we
will
give
it
our
sanction
which
we
shall
write
at
the
head
with
our
own
imperial
hand
as
the
present
institutions
have
for
their
aim
but
the
establishment
of
religion
government
the
nation
and
the
empire
we
pledge
ourselves
to
do
nothing
contrary
to
them
in
pledge
of
our
promise
we
will
after
having
placed
them
in
the
hall
in
which
is
kept
the
glorious
mantle
of
our
prophet
in
presence
of
all
the
ulema
and
grandees
of
the
empire
make
oath
by
the
name
of
god
and
afterwards
the
ulema
and
grandees
shall
also
swear
and
if
after
this
any
one
among
the
ulema
or
grandees
of
the
empire
or
any
other
person
whatsoever
shall
violate
these
institutions
he
shall
undergo
without
regard
to
rank
consideration
or
credit
the
penalty
annexed
to
his
crime
to
this
effect
a
penal
code
will
be
as
all
the
functionaries
of
the
empire
at
the
present
day
receive
suitable
salaries
and
as
the
appointments
of
those
whose
duties
are
not
sufficiently
well
remunerated
as
yet
will
be
regulated
a
vigorous
law
will
be
enacted
against
the
traffic
of
favor
and
of
charges
richvet
which
is
reproved
by
the
divine
law
and
which
is
one
of
the
principal
causes
of
the
decadence
of
the
empire
these
dispositions
above
stated
being
an
alteration
and
a
complete
renovation
from
the
ancient
usages
this
imperial
edict
will
be
published
at
constantinople
and
in
all
the
other
cities
of
our
empire
and
will
be
communicated
officially
to
all
the
ambassadors
of
friendly
powers
residing
at
constantinople
that
they
may
be
witnesses
of
the
alteration
in
our
institutions
which
if
it
please
god
shall
ever
endure
to
this
may
god
have
us
all
in
his
holy
and
worthy
keeping
may
those
who
are
guilty
of
an
act
contrary
to
the
present
institutions
be
the
object
of
divine
malediction
and
be
forever
deprived
of
every
kind
of
happiness
this
document
which
is
an
official
acknowledgment
of
the
existing
evils
and
corruptions
was
read
at
on
the
of
november
with
the
greatest
solemnity
before
a
vast
concourse
of
people
and
in
the
presence
of
the
foreign
representatives
in
order
to
commemorate
the
occasion
and
enforce
these
new
principles
it
was
proposed
to
erect
a
magnificent
public
monument
the
plans
and
designs
of
which
were
confided
to
the
writer
but
before
the
foundations
could
be
laid
a
complete
change
came
the
spirit
of
their
dreams
the
great
napoleon
has
wisely
pronounced
that
constantinople
is
the
key
to
all
europe
and
designed
to
be
the
capital
of
the
world
turkey
may
therefore
be
divided
and
subdivided
but
constantinople
the
great
bone
of
contention
being
indivisible
the
partition
of
turkey
becomes
an
impossibility
and
political
equilibrium
will
not
permit
any
one
power
to
usurp
its
possession
it
was
fortunate
that
it
fell
accidentally
into
the
hands
of
the
turks
who
were
incapable
of
availing
themselves
of
its
advantages
and
for
the
same
reason
it
is
desirable
they
should
retain
it
hence
the
maintenance
or
diplomatically
speaking
the
integrity
of
turkey
became
an
essential
element
in
the
polity
of
europe
the
proclamation
of
the
above
hatti
sherif
or
royal
edict
was
therefore
hailed
with
general
satisfaction
by
the
european
states
and
hopes
were
awakened
that
the
impending
danger
would
be
averted
by
such
an
entire
change
in
the
administrative
government
but
the
turks
of
the
ancien
régime
perceiving
no
threatening
attitude
in
their
european
neighbors
and
highly
offended
at
the
measures
of
the
reform
party
who
even
dared
to
insult
their
mussulman
prejudices
and
coolly
inform
them
that
the
council
chamber
was
not
a
theological
school
for
the
discussion
of
religious
polemics
nor
convertible
into
a
mosque
resolved
to
resist
to
the
utmost
and
their
own
party
they
therefore
in
a
body
protested
to
the
sultan
who
in
such
a
dilemma
could
do
nothing
but
dismiss
the
actual
ministry
and
organize
a
new
one
rendered
bold
by
success
the
new
ministry
at
whose
head
was
placed
riza
pasha
soon
began
to
adopt
fanatical
measures
whereby
to
modify
the
tanzimat
which
it
did
not
suit
their
policy
to
nullify
altogether
for
by
it
additional
security
of
life
and
property
was
granted
even
to
themselves
besides
the
lords
of
the
realm
who
only
existed
by
the
cohesive
power
of
public
plunder
foresaw
that
the
tanzimat
secured
equality
of
civil
and
political
rights
to
the
christians
especially
to
the
armenians
who
being
better
educated
and
more
enlightened
than
they
themselves
were
and
in
fact
the
ruling
spirits
would
soon
have
preceded
them
in
all
the
departments
and
taken
the
lead
in
the
control
of
the
country
schemes
of
oppression
were
formed
to
deprive
the
rayas
of
their
newly
acquired
privileges
even
the
external
semblance
of
equality
was
no
longer
tolerated
to
distinguish
them
from
the
true
followers
of
the
prophet
their
dress
being
the
same
an
order
was
issued
that
the
giavours
should
wear
a
certain
mark
on
their
fesses
a
piece
of
black
tape
even
the
grandees
of
the
christian
community
were
stigmatized
by
a
mock
badge
of
honor
made
of
gold
to
be
also
worn
on
the
side
of
the
fess
they
carried
their
fanaticism
so
far
as
even
to
defy
europe
in
the
decapitation
of
ovagim
an
armenian
apostate
who
had
abjured
mohammedanism
though
his
life
was
promised
to
lord
stratford
no
sooner
had
the
secretary
of
legation
alison
left
the
porte
than
the
unfortunate
victim
was
led
forth
and
beheaded
whatever
may
have
been
the
cause
of
the
sudden
reversal
of
their
merciful
intentions
it
is
well
known
that
prince
handgery
the
russian
dragoman
was
also
at
the
porte
and
did
not
leave
until
the
consummation
of
the
sentence
his
body
was
exposed
in
the
streets
of
constantinople
at
the
head
placed
between
his
legs
as
was
customary
with
the
european
cap
which
he
wore
upon
it
as
an
extra
insult
to
all
europe
the
bodies
of
state
criminals
were
formerly
exposed
in
public
for
three
days
but
the
weather
being
at
this
time
excessively
warm
the
late
was
advised
that
injurious
effects
might
result
from
such
a
long
exposure
who
sagely
remarked
that
the
fact
was
indeed
so
but
the
sad
results
would
be
still
more
palpably
felt
three
years
hence
strange
to
say
the
prediction
has
been
fully
verified
by
recent
events
thus
mussulman
fanaticism
brought
on
a
retrograde
movement
and
threatened
the
entire
ruin
of
the
country
and
the
rapacious
and
ambitious
dispositions
of
those
who
lived
on
the
fat
of
the
land
by
degrees
so
consumed
its
vitality
that
it
justly
merited
the
cognomen
of
the
the
eagle
and
the
vulture
were
hovering
over
the
expiring
empire
and
humanity
and
civilization
demanded
that
it
should
be
watched
over
with
the
hope
either
of
prolonging
its
existence
or
at
least
of
giving
it
a
decent
burial
russia
and
austria
who
thought
that
the
propitious
moment
had
arrived
to
pounce
upon
their
victim
resolved
to
accomplish
their
own
plans
by
one
sudden
and
effective
as
the
insulting
conduct
and
threatening
attitude
of
their
respective
emissaries
fully
demonstrated
but
their
expectations
were
not
to
be
realized
for
notwithstanding
the
corrupt
character
of
those
in
power
the
spirit
of
regeneration
was
not
wholly
extinct
in
the
country
the
liberal
party
some
of
whom
had
retired
from
public
life
in
disgust
and
others
who
giving
up
all
hope
of
reform
had
abandoned
their
favorite
project
and
joined
the
powers
that
be
in
such
an
emergency
like
true
patriots
whose
moral
influence
had
been
silently
exerted
over
the
people
came
to
the
rescue
resisting
every
form
of
bribery
and
fearless
of
menaces
they
boldly
took
up
the
gauntlet
and
war
was
declared
the
interests
of
europe
being
involved
in
the
fate
of
turkey
foreign
interference
became
inevitable
fortunate
it
is
not
only
for
turkey
but
for
europe
in
general
that
this
event
happened
at
a
time
when
such
interference
was
available
otherwise
turkey
like
poland
would
have
been
ingulphed
by
russia
and
austria
the
result
is
known
to
the
world
although
the
battle
has
been
fought
the
russian
bear
been
driven
to
his
den
and
the
congress
of
nations
at
paris
has
adopted
the
osmanlis
into
their
fraternity
still
the
eastern
question
or
the
maintenance
of
turkey
as
a
barrier
between
russian
despotism
and
european
liberty
is
far
from
being
settled
for
the
problem
is
not
solved
in
as
much
as
the
ways
and
means
for
the
future
permanence
of
this
empire
are
not
proclaimed
to
the
world
turkey
is
apparently
secured
from
russian
animosities
but
unless
the
country
be
set
on
a
new
basis
and
rendered
capable
of
maintaining
itself
the
future
of
turkey
will
inevitably
be
only
a
repetition
of
the
past
if
not
indeed
far
worse
this
difficult
subject
will
no
doubt
engross
the
wisdom
of
europe
but
the
present
is
the
moment
to
be
seized
while
the
indebtedness
of
the
osmanlis
to
their
allies
is
fresh
in
their
memories
and
the
gates
of
their
vast
empire
stand
open
to
civilization
and
reform
will
the
allies
again
content
themselves
with
mere
scrolls
parchments
and
state
papers
like
the
tanzimat
of
shall
the
patriots
of
the
state
again
be
left
subject
to
the
sway
of
a
conceited
bigotry
and
blind
fanaticism
in
a
word
shall
the
country
be
permitted
to
feed
upon
its
own
vitals
until
it
consumes
itself
the
time
has
arrived
when
fictitious
progress
can
no
longer
be
tolerated
and
a
wholesome
reaction
most
take
place
turkey
and
its
inhabitants
have
suffered
not
only
from
external
aggressions
but
internal
discord
has
maintained
an
empire
of
misrule
religious
animosity
and
party
spirit
have
reigned
supreme
greeks
and
christians
hating
each
other
christians
denouncing
christians
and
the
grand
mufti
pouring
out
the
anathemas
of
the
prophet
upon
the
whole
host
of
giavours
whence
then
in
such
a
population
can
any
unity
of
feeling
or
of
action
spring
amor
patriæ
philanthropy
progress
are
all
merged
in
sectarianism
and
the
rage
for
religious
supremacy
hitherto
mohammedanism
filling
the
places
of
authority
and
possessing
the
only
permanent
foothold
upon
the
territory
itself
has
left
the
christian
population
without
incentive
to
competition
of
any
sort
even
in
the
earliest
conflicts
of
mohammedanism
three
proposals
were
always
made
to
those
whose
territories
were
invaded
to
join
the
standard
of
the
prophet
to
adhere
to
their
own
religious
tenets
as
tributaries
or
the
trial
by
combat
thus
evincing
a
wonderful
spirit
of
liberality
in
a
conquering
power
whether
the
antagonism
was
that
of
conquest
or
propagandism
religious
toleration
was
only
a
wise
policy
of
the
ottoman
government
for
as
long
as
the
rayas
were
of
various
creeds
and
conflicting
with
each
other
the
mussulmans
were
in
no
danger
as
in
union
is
strength
so
in
the
disunion
of
the
subjects
was
the
safety
of
the
rulers
the
rayas
as
has
been
said
losing
their
own
nationality
in
their
condition
of
servitude
clung
to
the
tenets
of
their
respective
creeds
and
knew
no
country
no
nationality
but
that
of
religion
in
turkey
all
classes
of
christians
and
jews
have
always
had
freedom
of
religions
worship
with
the
free
exercise
of
their
peculiar
rites
and
observances
public
and
private
the
proof
may
daily
be
witnessed
in
their
funeral
processions
with
torches
crosses
and
chanting
priests
preceded
by
kavasses
or
police
officers
as
the
pages
of
the
missionary
herald
of
the
american
board
for
foreign
missions
amply
testify
besides
it
is
a
well
known
fact
that
all
the
christian
churches
are
privileged
to
hold
vakufs
of
their
own
on
the
same
footing
as
those
of
the
mosques
the
very
existence
of
so
many
differing
creeds
and
their
constant
free
discussions
is
proof
of
a
great
degree
of
religious
toleration
even
the
recent
war
was
the
result
of
this
tolerance
for
it
is
well
known
that
the
original
matter
of
debate
was
whether
russia
or
france
or
in
other
words
whether
the
greek
church
or
the
catholic
should
control
the
holy
places
of
jerusalem
these
holy
places
not
only
are
in
the
dominions
of
the
sultan
but
are
the
objects
of
religious
veneration
to
the
mussulmans
themselves
who
reverently
style
them
or
holy
jerusalem
yet
with
a
remarkable
spirit
of
conciliation
their
jurisdiction
was
conceded
to
the
christians
travellers
who
have
chanced
to
be
in
jerusalem
during
the
festivities
of
easter
may
remember
that
when
the
christians
are
quarrelling
and
contending
with
each
other
the
mussulmans
are
forced
to
interfere
to
keep
peace
and
tranquillity
it
is
true
that
the
ottoman
government
has
frequently
refused
permission
to
the
christians
to
erect
or
repair
churches
etc
this
however
is
not
from
a
spirit
of
intolerance
for
it
soon
was
understood
that
a
liberal
sum
might
be
obtained
for
these
privileges
and
the
officials
could
not
resist
such
occasions
for
increasing
their
revenues
the
same
advantage
is
taken
of
the
party
intrigues
at
the
time
of
the
election
of
the
new
patriarchs
of
the
armenians
and
greeks
in
the
days
of
ignorance
this
election
cost
the
armenians
piasters
but
years
of
experience
have
raised
the
value
of
the
sultan
sanction
to
piasters
and
the
greeks
amongst
whom
party
strife
is
far
greater
pay
between
two
and
three
millions
for
the
installation
of
their
spiritual
head
hence
it
is
evident
that
religious
toleration
is
a
principle
of
the
government
and
the
contrary
an
incidental
abuse
for
the
advantage
of
those
in
power
this
very
abuse
has
had
its
origin
among
the
christians
themselves
who
were
ready
to
bribe
the
ruling
power
to
any
amount
in
order
to
gain
their
own
ends
nevertheless
russia
has
endeavored
to
mislead
the
whole
world
and
especially
the
christian
population
of
turkey
with
the
plausible
pretence
of
a
guarantee
of
liberty
of
worship
to
all
classes
of
christians
in
turkey
while
her
conduct
at
home
belies
her
sincerity
the
cross
upon
the
armenian
church
at
odessa
was
not
long
ago
removed
by
order
of
the
government
lest
the
population
should
be
misled
by
the
impression
that
the
edifice
belonged
to
the
established
church
and
in
the
case
of
intermarriage
the
law
orders
that
the
children
should
invariably
be
educated
in
the
russian
faith
the
adage
nearer
the
church
farther
from
god
is
peculiarly
applicable
to
russia
for
we
are
told
by
gibbon
that
long
before
the
turks
were
in
constantinople
the
russians
made
several
attempts
to
capture
this
fated
city
and
were
only
driven
away
by
the
flood
discharged
from
the
batteries
were
the
greeks
of
that
time
mohammedans
or
was
there
any
suffering
christianity
that
these
philanthropic
muscovites
were
impelled
to
come
to
the
rescue
of
the
christian
faith
there
are
some
strange
records
in
history
which
conflict
materially
with
political
hypocrisy
the
fact
is
under
the
pretence
of
being
the
champion
of
the
cross
the
real
object
of
russia
has
ever
been
to
avail
herself
of
the
existing
religious
fanaticism
of
the
east
and
by
fanning
the
flames
of
christian
ardor
to
institute
a
crusade
of
the
nineteenth
century
nations
are
not
however
governed
by
sympathy
but
by
interest
and
the
christians
have
had
too
bitter
experience
of
russian
protection
to
be
again
caught
in
the
same
net
the
armenians
of
erzuroum
were
induced
to
emigrate
into
the
russian
land
of
canaan
which
they
were
assured
flowed
with
milk
and
honey
but
when
they
drank
these
honeyed
waters
they
found
them
only
wormwood
and
gall
and
all
who
could
eagerly
burst
their
fetters
and
returned
to
turkey
preferring
moslem
oppression
to
moscovite
despotism
and
systematic
serfdom
the
greeks
who
were
so
clamorous
against
the
turks
when
they
succeeded
in
obtaining
their
independence
by
raising
the
standard
of
the
cross
against
the
crescent
of
the
prophet
showed
very
little
preference
for
the
hellenic
government
since
after
a
while
they
returned
by
thousands
into
turkey
the
effect
of
turkish
policy
has
been
such
that
there
is
a
prevalent
desire
among
the
rayas
to
escape
from
their
allegiance
to
such
a
government
and
place
themselves
under
foreign
protection
not
from
any
fear
of
religious
intolerance
whatever
but
merely
to
obtain
comparative
liberty
and
justice
indeed
what
incentive
have
the
people
in
general
either
turks
or
rayas
to
patriotism
or
what
care
they
for
national
prosperity
when
they
are
forced
to
regard
themselves
as
mere
tenants
of
their
own
houses
and
lands
missak
the
late
armenian
banker
did
not
escape
into
russia
from
any
fear
of
religious
oppression
but
to
avoid
the
vindictive
persecutions
of
the
minister
of
finance
it
is
not
then
religious
freedom
that
the
christians
of
turkey
require
but
political
franchise
and
unbiased
justice
the
past
has
sadly
proved
that
the
mohammedans
are
incapable
even
of
self
government
or
at
best
mohammedan
domination
has
had
a
demoralizing
tendency
over
half
if
not
the
entire
population
is
the
country
then
to
be
ruled
by
the
other
half
of
the
inhabitants
the
christian
population
this
is
another
impossibility
for
this
population
is
like
a
house
divided
against
itself
and
besides
their
incapacity
in
other
respects
they
having
so
long
felt
the
bitterest
animosity
towards
their
mussulman
masters
would
in
their
turn
become
even
greater
oppressors
than
the
mohammedans
themselves
as
was
evinced
by
the
conduct
of
the
armenians
of
erzuroum
during
the
last
war
with
russia
the
eastern
question
is
not
however
one
of
propagandism
either
of
christianity
or
of
mohammedanism
but
demands
while
granting
perfect
liberty
of
conscience
to
all
classes
how
political
and
civil
equality
may
be
maintained
throughout
the
ottoman
dominions
fusion
then
is
the
only
policy
that
can
resuscitate
the
turkish
empire
the
tanzimat
was
the
beginning
of
a
reform
but
there
were
no
coercive
measures
put
into
play
to
overthrow
the
power
of
ancient
usages
so
that
the
proclamation
soon
became
almost
a
dead
letter
the
blind
bigotry
of
the
people
and
the
absolute
power
of
the
heads
of
government
imbued
as
they
are
with
a
spirit
of
favoritism
and
corruption
have
hitherto
excluded
the
unfortunate
subjects
of
the
sultan
from
the
justice
and
protection
which
are
the
sacred
rights
of
every
son
of
adam
there
has
been
no
security
for
property
nor
any
inducement
to
honesty
in
turkey
a
man
has
under
the
existing
laws
every
temptation
to
injure
his
neighbor
to
any
extent
and
the
innocent
have
no
other
means
of
protecting
themselves
and
their
interests
than
by
resorting
to
counter
dishonesty
for
instance
if
a
man
is
unjustly
accused
of
a
debt
of
one
hundred
dollars
it
would
naturally
be
inferred
that
he
would
at
once
deny
the
accusation
and
call
for
proof
but
such
an
honest
procedure
would
not
answer
in
the
turkish
courts
of
justice
for
it
would
immediately
give
the
plaintiff
the
desired
privilege
of
producing
two
hired
witnesses
by
whose
testimony
the
defendant
would
beyond
a
doubt
be
condemned
to
pay
the
pretended
debt
the
only
alternative
in
such
instances
is
to
verify
the
principle
set
a
rogue
to
catch
a
rogue
by
acknowledging
the
debt
at
the
same
time
declaring
that
it
has
already
been
paid
thus
the
accuser
is
deprived
of
the
privilege
of
suborning
witnesses
and
the
defendant
avails
himself
of
that
prerogative
therefore
the
moral
sense
of
the
community
is
corrupted
and
impels
the
people
only
to
strive
to
excel
each
other
in
roguery
in
such
a
poisoned
atmosphere
no
salutary
influence
can
be
exercised
until
the
axe
is
laid
at
the
root
of
the
evil
in
order
then
to
give
a
fresh
stamina
to
this
fading
empire
a
new
and
complete
code
of
justice
is
needed
consistent
with
progressive
civilization
and
suited
to
the
necessities
of
these
heterogeneous
peoples
to
overthrow
the
sceptre
of
oppressive
bigotry
the
next
thing
to
be
effected
is
an
entire
separation
of
church
and
state
so
as
to
prevent
the
interference
of
the
ulema
in
the
administration
of
justice
thus
also
the
aristocracy
of
religion
being
abolished
the
animosity
existing
between
the
moslems
and
christians
will
be
annihilated
and
the
hitherto
excluded
portion
of
the
subjects
of
the
sultan
acknowledged
as
members
of
the
great
ottoman
family
the
identity
of
religious
faith
and
nationality
long
swayed
even
the
european
states
but
in
those
countries
this
idea
is
now
obsolete
and
must
of
necessity
become
so
in
turkey
since
she
has
entered
their
confederacy
a
mixed
administration
must
be
formed
composed
of
representatives
of
the
different
communities
and
mussulman
supremacy
no
longer
tolerated
the
mutual
benefit
of
this
combination
is
evident
for
while
the
christians
in
sharing
the
supreme
power
would
lose
their
former
incentives
to
cunning
and
the
mussulmans
on
their
part
would
make
rapid
strides
in
the
true
science
of
government
the
tenure
by
which
this
mutual
authority
is
to
be
held
must
be
supported
and
confirmed
by
a
superior
tribunal
as
it
were
consisting
of
the
powers
of
europe
who
having
constituted
themselves
the
champions
of
turkey
and
shed
their
blood
in
her
defense
are
entitled
to
become
the
guardians
of
her
interests
which
are
henceforth
so
identified
with
their
own
the
resources
of
the
country
must
be
developed
and
a
system
of
internal
improvements
established
by
which
the
ruinous
principle
of
centralization
will
be
counteracted
and
the
beneficial
effects
of
this
regeneration
felt
in
the
uttermost
corners
of
the
land
a
general
and
accurate
survey
of
the
country
is
indispensable
defining
the
exact
boundaries
of
both
public
and
private
lands
and
the
idea
that
the
natural
treasures
of
the
soil
belonging
to
individuals
appertain
to
the
government
must
be
abandoned
hitherto
much
of
the
wealth
of
the
country
has
lain
dormant
because
there
was
no
incentive
to
exploration
of
any
sort
the
vakuf
system
must
be
abolished
and
the
accumulated
wealth
devoted
to
internal
improvements
thus
depriving
the
ulema
of
their
great
arm
of
power
it
is
true
the
government
has
in
some
measure
controlled
these
revenues
and
established
a
bureau
of
all
the
vakufs
called
evkaf
but
it
has
never
dared
to
appropriate
or
to
touch
any
portion
of
this
income
for
its
own
purposes
equal
taxation
should
be
levied
on
property
and
the
tariff
equitably
regulated
a
limited
free
press
must
be
established
as
the
only
means
of
bringing
into
publicity
the
corruptions
and
abuses
to
which
the
officials
have
hitherto
been
addicted
these
are
the
most
apparent
means
of
the
preservation
and
regeneration
of
turkey
broad
principles
may
be
laid
as
the
foundation
but
the
edifice
is
to
be
raised
and
the
master
builders
must
not
desert
their
work
for
unless
these
salutary
reforms
are
accomplished
by
the
aid
and
influence
of
the
european
powers
there
is
no
hope
of
the
preservation
of
turkey
nor
is
there
any
security
for
the
peace
of
all
europe
and
the
world
in
general
the
only
question
is
can
these
reformations
be
effected
in
turkey
the
nature
of
the
mohammedan
religion
is
not
essentially
in
opposition
to
reform
modern
times
have
proved
the
koran
of
a
more
elastic
nature
than
was
once
supposed
as
was
exemplified
in
the
establishment
of
quarantine
regulations
when
it
was
pretended
that
it
was
blasphemous
to
interfere
with
the
decrees
of
allah
to
protect
human
life
but
as
it
was
proved
that
the
koran
allowed
the
measure
was
sanctioned
by
the
expounders
of
that
sacred
book
and
accepted
by
the
mussulmans
apostasy
from
islamism
was
formerly
punished
with
death
but
when
lord
stratford
de
redcliffe
interfered
in
behalf
of
humanity
in
the
case
of
poor
ovagim
who
was
beheaded
in
the
koran
was
found
to
be
on
his
side
the
same
lenity
was
manifested
by
the
mohammedans
of
hindoostan
only
a
few
months
ago
towards
an
apostate
on
the
plea
that
the
country
was
now
under
british
jurisdiction
the
reason
is
that
the
principles
of
islamism
are
so
very
simple
that
they
can
be
adapted
to
any
degree
of
modification
and
reform
especially
under
the
pressure
of
circumstances
besides
necessity
knows
no
law
not
even
the
koran
itself
but
it
may
be
said
that
the
government
thus
remodelled
will
no
longer
be
turkish
or
mohammedan
surely
the
aim
of
the
friends
of
this
falling
empire
is
not
to
a
decaying
faith
but
to
enable
the
turks
and
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
to
gird
up
their
strength
and
stand
before
the
world
a
united
and
powerful
people
freed
from
bigotry
and
superstition
a
great
ottoman
nation
turkey
has
been
admitted
into
the
fraternity
of
europe
not
as
a
mohammedan
power
but
as
one
of
the
powers
that
rule
the
domains
the
sultan
has
a
voice
among
the
potentates
of
his
times
not
the
voice
of
mohammed
the
prophet
but
of
the
civilized
and
regenerated
friend
of
his
own
people
and
the
world
in
general
a
new
era
has
dawned
upon
mohammedanism
for
if
the
christian
world
has
for
the
first
time
received
into
its
confederation
an
empire
the
mohammedans
by
entering
such
a
confederation
have
also
for
the
first
time
placed
themselves
on
an
equality
with
the
former
giavours
whom
the
precepts
of
the
koran
have
proscribed
and
doomed
to
the
sword
of
the
faithful
here
then
is
a
bold
stride
beyond
the
confines
of
a
faith
only
suited
to
barbaric
days
and
well
calculated
to
sway
the
minds
of
a
superstitious
multitude
on
to
conquest
as
consanguinity
with
civilization
is
strengthened
who
can
trace
the
pathway
of
the
mussulman
nation
through
the
world
history
the
genius
of
the
country
and
the
condition
of
the
people
are
not
in
opposition
to
the
progress
of
reform
the
past
history
of
this
nation
has
been
the
progress
of
mohammedanism
its
conquests
and
its
laws
as
moses
was
both
the
spiritual
and
temporal
to
the
jews
so
has
mohammed
been
to
the
turkomans
such
laws
suited
the
exigencies
of
the
times
but
the
sword
is
sheathed
and
in
its
sheath
too
must
abide
the
darkness
and
barbarity
of
past
ages
besides
mohammedanism
in
turkey
is
not
the
same
as
in
arabia
or
bokhara
where
imams
and
priests
predominate
the
turkomans
had
previous
to
embracing
islamism
a
civil
government
of
their
own
and
in
making
the
koran
the
rule
of
faith
and
conduct
they
never
lost
the
idea
of
sovereignty
independent
of
religion
hence
the
turkish
has
never
been
like
the
papal
government
where
cardinals
and
bishops
represent
all
the
departments
of
the
pontifical
state
the
very
existence
of
two
distinct
representatives
of
the
sultan
the
grand
vezir
and
the
are
evidences
of
a
separation
of
church
and
state
if
the
ecclesiastical
has
hitherto
superseded
the
civil
power
it
has
been
through
the
superstitions
of
the
people
and
the
chicanery
of
the
officials
the
only
real
union
is
in
the
person
of
the
sultan
who
is
the
proxy
of
allah
and
the
supreme
ruler
of
his
people
his
will
and
his
edicts
are
regarded
by
them
with
superstitious
reverence
the
natural
relations
of
this
empire
with
the
rest
of
the
world
as
well
as
its
new
ties
of
consanguinity
with
civilization
must
of
necessity
bring
about
a
revolution
of
policy
as
well
as
of
action
his
majesty
has
already
introduced
many
measures
of
reform
such
as
the
abolishing
of
capital
punishment
the
promulgation
of
a
new
constitution
with
the
privilege
of
free
deliberation
in
the
national
councils
etc
and
besides
all
these
he
has
already
commenced
even
in
his
own
person
and
household
a
renovation
which
is
in
reality
only
a
conformation
to
the
habits
of
civilized
life
he
has
become
himself
a
salaried
executive
diminished
his
own
retinue
etc
the
sultan
well
understands
the
imitative
nature
of
his
own
people
and
is
aware
that
he
is
the
model
to
the
grand
vezir
and
the
various
pashas
who
in
their
turn
are
the
channels
of
his
majesty
own
movements
to
the
rest
of
their
fellow
citizens
constantinople
is
the
city
where
the
game
is
played
by
high
and
low
so
does
the
grand
mufti
indeed
the
very
monkeys
of
india
can
not
excel
them
in
their
disposition
to
imitate
each
other
for
it
is
said
that
a
merchant
once
carrying
a
large
bale
of
fesses
or
red
caps
on
a
speculation
opened
his
goods
on
the
way
with
the
view
to
examine
them
and
taking
one
out
and
putting
it
upon
his
head
laid
down
to
repose
a
while
under
a
tree
what
was
his
astonishment
on
waking
to
find
his
stock
of
caps
had
taken
wings
he
looked
around
in
dismay
but
happening
to
cast
his
eyes
upwards
he
beheld
a
whole
colony
of
monkeys
each
sporting
one
of
his
caps
it
seemed
a
hopeless
case
to
catch
each
one
of
them
and
force
him
to
surrender
the
cap
in
his
anger
and
bewilderment
he
seized
his
cap
and
in
a
passion
threw
it
to
the
ground
when
the
whole
tribe
of
these
mimicking
creatures
of
the
grove
instinctively
with
the
same
vehemence
divested
themselves
of
their
in
imitation
of
sultan
pashas
and
efendi
the
people
in
the
east
have
already
doffed
their
robes
and
turbans
and
are
ready
for
other
reforms
if
derived
from
the
same
honored
projectors
crosses
now
adorn
the
breasts
of
statesmen
and
his
majesty
the
sultan
displays
on
his
person
the
insignia
of
the
garter
indeed
much
good
may
be
anticipated
from
the
liberal
sentiments
and
benevolent
dispositions
of
the
sultan
were
he
but
rightly
advised
and
sustained
in
the
exercise
of
his
absolute
power
with
the
requisite
protection
against
inimical
intrigues
and
aggressions
both
foreign
and
domestic
besides
the
government
itself
is
already
divided
into
two
parties
the
liberal
who
are
ready
to
throw
off
the
yoke
of
ancient
prejudices
and
the
church
party
who
not
only
with
a
blind
zeal
but
with
hopes
of
are
resolved
to
maintain
the
rule
of
superstition
now
as
the
advancement
the
maintenance
of
the
country
is
dependent
on
the
one
its
retrogradation
and
downfall
involved
in
the
other
so
europe
necessarily
holds
out
its
strong
arm
to
the
one
and
leaves
the
other
not
only
unsupported
but
threatened
the
wisest
of
the
turkish
statesmen
are
therefore
prepared
for
changes
indeed
they
feel
themselves
bound
to
certain
compromises
with
their
friends
the
allied
powers
who
engaged
in
the
war
as
they
well
know
not
with
the
view
to
reinstate
mussulman
oppression
and
bigoted
misrule
but
to
set
the
country
on
a
new
footing
by
raising
the
christian
population
to
a
level
with
the
mussulman
considering
the
almost
equal
proportion
of
the
christians
to
the
mohammedans
it
is
but
just
there
should
at
least
be
an
equality
of
national
rights
and
privileges
for
in
civilized
countries
even
a
minority
is
protected
and
their
rights
respected
how
much
more
then
should
this
be
the
case
where
there
is
not
only
no
disproportion
in
numbers
but
decided
superiority
in
civilization
besides
should
the
mohammedans
resist
the
required
concessions
the
great
christian
population
of
turkey
is
ready
to
join
their
western
in
any
movement
therefore
it
is
only
a
wise
policy
in
the
mohammedans
making
a
virtue
of
necessity
to
submit
to
circumstances
rather
than
by
opposing
to
work
their
own
ruin
the
great
essential
is
a
community
of
interest
which
has
already
in
some
cases
produced
a
legitimate
action
the
corps
of
firemen
is
composed
of
both
mussulmans
and
christians
who
not
only
unite
in
a
common
effort
for
mutual
good
but
call
each
other
brothers
carouse
together
shed
their
blood
in
each
other
defense
and
never
seem
to
remember
their
characteristic
dissimilarities
there
is
already
an
indisposedness
towards
the
tenacity
of
religious
fanaticism
which
is
so
hostile
to
moral
and
social
progress
many
of
the
distinguished
men
of
turkey
having
resided
abroad
and
acquired
foreign
languages
have
imbibed
a
taste
for
the
literature
of
europe
a
familiarity
with
the
works
of
such
authors
as
voltaire
volney
and
rousseau
has
made
many
of
them
indeed
most
of
the
younger
members
of
the
porte
are
men
of
liberal
sentiments
they
pay
external
deference
to
the
religion
of
the
state
rather
from
motives
of
than
from
any
moral
conviction
nevertheless
some
of
these
very
men
so
long
habituated
to
power
and
the
spoils
of
office
may
under
the
guise
of
religious
enthusiasm
become
the
instigators
of
opposition
through
the
superstitions
of
the
multitude
hence
the
gazettes
will
occasionally
report
hostile
demonstrations
and
even
bloodshed
but
any
attempts
at
insurrection
must
prove
futile
for
with
the
destruction
of
the
janissaries
the
spirit
of
rebellion
perished
in
turkey
besides
recent
events
having
brought
the
superiority
and
power
of
europe
within
the
immediate
vision
of
the
whole
population
they
have
been
forced
to
call
to
mind
their
own
proverb
that
the
elephant
is
greater
than
the
camel
and
doubtless
they
will
henceforth
arrive
at
a
juster
appreciation
of
their
own
capabilities
much
more
might
be
written
on
so
extended
a
theme
as
the
sultan
and
his
people
and
an
abler
pen
portray
the
condition
of
this
interesting
eastern
empire
just
emerging
from
barbarism
into
civilization
yet
it
may
be
hoped
that
these
humble
efforts
will
awaken
some
sympathy
in
behalf
of
a
country
and
its
inhabitants
who
so
much
need
the
interest
and
assistance
of
other
lands
at
a
moment
too
when
the
question
is
of
life
or
death
of
free
progressive
life
under
the
shelter
of
the
broad
wings
of
civilization
or
of
a
suffering
death
within
the
claws
of
the
rapacious
vulture
of
despotism
and
oppression
it
may
be
objected
that
turkey
has
been
represented
en
couleur
de
rose
if
that
roseate
hue
has
been
given
the
odorous
flower
has
been
presented
with
all
its
thorns
divested
of
the
verdure
which
might
have
concealed
their
bristling
points
but
the
sweetest
rose
may
preserve
its
pure
essence
and
odor
even
while
growing
amid
wild
and
poisonous
roots
and
if
the
noxious
weeds
can
be
uprooted
turkey
may
with
the
requisite
culture
become
one
of
the
fairest
gardens
which
adorn
our
beautiful
planet
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
morning
twilight
is
already
casting
its
softening
beams
over
this
land
of
the
orient
and
that
the
glory
of
the
sun
of
peace
and
regeneration
will
ere
long
irradiate
with
its
glorious
effulgence
this
ancient
and
interesting
empire
the
end
note
some
historians
attribute
the
origin
of
the
janissaries
to
orkhan
at
the
same
time
all
agree
that
they
were
blessed
by
hadji
bektash
forgetting
that
the
said
sheikh
was
only
contemporary
with
mourad
and
not
orkhan
