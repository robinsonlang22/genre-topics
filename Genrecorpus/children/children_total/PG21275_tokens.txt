the

illustrated
the
goat
and
her
kid
by

sheldon
and
company

to
act
of
congress

the
year
by

and
company

of

court
of
the
southern
district
of
new
york
the
goat
and
her
kid
the
grass
plot
at
the
back
of
the
cottage
was
a
very
bright
green
and
sparkled
with
the
morning
dews
it
was
kept
smooth
and
level
and
short
by
the
going
over
it
once
a
week
and
still
more
by
the
constant
nibbling
of
the
goat
who
was
allowed
to
be
there
all
day
because
she
had
a
pretty
little
young
kid
that
ran
by
her
side
but
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
this
kid
was
contented
with
always
running
close
to
its
mother
side
kids
are
very
fond
of
dancing
and
frisking
about
and
this
one
was
more
fond
of
it
than
any
other
in
the
whole
village
one
day
a
poor
italian
boy
came
down
the
lane
playing
upon
a
pipe
and
beating
a
little
tabor
he
used
to
play
these
for
two
dolls
that
danced
upon
a
board
by
means
of
a
string
which
went
through
their
bodies
and
was
fastened
to
his
knee
so
that
when
he
moved
his
knee
quickly
the
dolls
seemed
to
dance
about
upon
the
board
the
boy
stopped
at
the
gate
put
down
his
board
placed
his
dolls
upon
it
with
the
string
at
his
knee
began
to
play
his
pipe
and
beat
upon
his
tabor
and
as
he
played
the
dolls
danced
up
and
down
and
round
and
round
first
on
one
side
then
on
the
other
now
bobbing
down
their
heads
now
frisking
about
their
feet
but
while
this
was
going
on
at
the
gate
the
kid
heard
the
pipe
and
tabor
and
after
listening
to
it
a
minute
with
its
head
on
one
side
suddenly
jumped
up
in
the
air
gave
a
great
many
little
kicks
very
quick
and
funny
then
ran
frisking
round
its
mother
and
at
last
stood
upon
its
hind
legs
and
danced
all
across
the
grass
plot
little
mary
who
had
been
looking
at
the
dolls
happened
to
turn
round
at
the
moment
when
the
kid
was
dancing
o
you
little
dear
dear
kid
cried
mary
first
running
towards
the
kid
then
back
to
look
at
the
dolls
then
again
at
the
kid
then
at
the
dolls
and
the
italian
boy
played
away
with
his
pipe
and
tabor
and
made
his
dolls
jump
up
in
the
air
and
reel
and
set
and
hop
but
it
was
all
nothing
to
the
jumps
in
the
air
of
the
kid
and
its
frisking
kicks
and
flings
and
its
fun
and
its
fancies
at
last
the
italian
boy
went
away
with
a
large
piece
of
bread
and
cheese
in
his
hand
and
his
dolls
and
at
his
back
but
playing
his
pipe
and
tabor
all
down
the
lane
the
goat
stood
looking
after
him
with
her
head
raised
tall
in
the
air
and
a
serious
face
but
the
kid
continued
to
dance
as
long
as
the
pipe
and
tabor
could
be
heard
the
little
foundling
in
the
beginning
of
june
when
the
young
birds
have
got
nearly
all
their
principal
feathers
but
have
not
yet
learned
to
fly
it
is
a
sad
thing
if
by
any
accident
one
of
them
tumbles
out
of
the
nest
this
misfortune
sometimes
happens
when
a
nest
is
too
full
five
or
six
little
birds
are
a
good
many
for
a
nest
no
bigger
than
a
teacup
and
there
are
often
as
many
as
five
we
have
also
to
recollect
that
these
young
things
are
always
very
wild
and
impatient
and
unreasonable
and
make
a
great
fluttering
together
and
scramble
and
climb
over
each
other
especially
when
their
mother
brings
them
food
in
her
bill
there
is
of
course
not
enough
food
for
all
of
them
at
once
but
they
all
try
to
get
it
at
once
and
some
of
them
are
naughty
and
greedy
and
try
to
get
a
second
morsel
before
their
brothers
and
sisters
have
had
any
at
all
now
the
careful
knows
this
very
well
and
she
therefore
divides
everything
among
them
so
that
each
has
a
bit
in
turn
and
while
she
feeds
them
she
begs
the
rest
to
be
as
patient
as
they
can
and
not
flutter
and
chirrup
and
gape
so
widely
and
above
all
things
to
mind
they
do
not
tumble
or
push
each
other
over
the
edge
of
the
nest
it
happened
one
day
that
this
very
accident
occurred
in
a
nest
which
had
been
built
in
the
largest
branch
of
a
this
tree
grew
in
the
middle
of
a
hedge
that
went
round
a
large
field
where
there
were
at
this
time
a
number
of
haymakers
all
very
busy
with
the
hay
while
some
were
tossing
the
hay
about
in
order
to
spread
it
out
in
the
sun
and
dry
it
others
were
raking
up
the
hay
that
was
already
dry
enough
and
piling
it
up
into
haycocks
men
and
women
and
boys
and
girls
too
were
all
at
work
in
this
way
and
singing
in
the
sun
as
they
tossed
the
hay
with
forks
or
raked
it
up
with
large
wooden
rakes
when
the
hay
was
thus
moved
about
on
the
field
a
frog
sometimes
jumped
up
and
went
silently
leaping
away
towards
the
hedge
and
sometimes
a
sprang
out
from
the
short
grass
with
a
loud
squeak
and
ran
off
to
hide
himself
in
the
hedge
squeaking
all
the
way
not
because
he
was
in
the
least
hurt
but
because
he
had
waked
in
a
great
fright
at
the
same
time
that
all
this
was
going
on
the
sparrow
whose
nest
was
in
the
had
brought
a
few
seeds
and
a
morsel
of
crust
to
her
young
ones
the
seed
she
distributed
with
ease
but
the
morsel
of
crust
was
rather
hard
and
required
her
to
pinch
and
peck
it
a
good
deal
with
her
bill
before
it
could
be
soft
enough
for
the
young
birds
the
young
ones
however
were
all
so
anxious
to
be
first
to
receive
the
crust
the
moment
it
was
ready
that
they
all
began
to
make
a
loud
chirruping
and
scrambling
and
pushing
and
fluttering
and
trampling
and
climbing
over
each
other
till
at
last
two
of
them
were
on
the
very
edge
of
the
nest
and
had
each
got
hold
of
the
crust
but
the
did
not
approve
of
such
rudeness
so
she
took
it
away
from
them
in
her
own
bill
just
as
the
two
were
beginning
to
pull
with
all
their
might
standing
on
opposite
sides
of
the
nest
they
could
not
recover
themselves
but
over
they
went
fluttering
down
into
the
tree
one
fell
into
the
next
bough
below
but
the
other
went
fluttering
into
the
hedge
under
the
tree
the
mother
helped
the
nearest
one
up
again
into
the
nest
by
showing
it
how
to
hop
and
fly
from
branch
to
branch
the
other
however
was
too
low
down
so
there
sat
the
unfortunate
little
fellow
all
alone
upon
a
twig
chirruping
and
looking
up
in
vain
at
his
lost
nest
illustration
this
unlucky
nestling
had
not
long
sat
in
this
way
before
some
boys
who
had
brought
the
haymakers
their
dinners
and
were
returning
home
saw
him
in
the
hedge
and
immediately
began
to
try
to
catch
him
but
though
he
could
not
fly
he
could
flutter
and
if
he
was
not
able
to
run
at
least
he
could
hop
so
every
time
one
of
the
boys
got
near
to
him
the
nestling
scrambled
on
to
the
next
bough
and
thus
from
bough
to
bough
all
along
the
hedge
if
the
boys
had
only
known
how
dreadfully
frightened
the
poor
little
bird
was
they
never
could
have
been
so
cruel
as
to
hunt
him
in
this
way
they
did
not
know
this
however
and
only
thought
of
catching
him
at
last
he
had
got
to
the
end
of
the
hedge
and
then
went
fluttering
down
upon
the
field
with
the
boys
after
him
they
soon
were
so
close
to
him
as
he
hopped
and
fluttered
along
the
short
grass
that
the
poor
little
fellow
felt
their
hands
would
presently
be
upon
him
and
as
a
last
chance
of
escape
he
crept
and
hid
himself
under
a
wisp
of
hay
just
at
that
moment
there
came
into
the
field
charles
turner
with
his
sister
fanny
and
their
maid
each
having
a
little
wooden
rake
to
make
hay
with
they
saw
the
boys
all
running
very
eagerly
after
something
in
the
grass
and
they
ran
directly
towards
them
to
see
what
it
was
o
cried
charles
it
is
a
poor
little
bird
that
can
not
fly
do
not
hurt
it
cried
fanny
pray
charley
ask
them
not
to
hurt
it
the
nestling
had
been
obliged
to
hop
from
beneath
his
little
morsel
of
hay
and
had
now
crept
underneath
a
haycock
we
did
not
mean
to
hurt
it
miss
said
one
of
the
boys
we
only
wanted
to
catch
it
and
we
could
not
but
i
am
afraid
one
of
us
trod
upon
it
somehow
by
accident
when
it
was
under
the
bit
of
hay
there
and
perhaps
it
has
been
hurt
somewhere
i
very
sorry
if
it
is
hurt
as
he
said
this
the
boys
all
went
away
and
the
one
who
had
spoken
really
look
sorry
i
wonder
where
the
little
fellow
is
hiding
said
charles
if
he
has
been
hurt
we
had
better
look
for
him
to
see
if
we
can
help
him
to
find
his
nest
yes
let
us
look
for
him
said
fanny
and
they
both
went
to
work
directly
to
remove
the
hay
and
search
underneath
the
haycock
sarah
their
maid
helping
them
they
were
not
long
in
finding
the
nestling
he
was
crouching
close
to
the
ground
with
one
bright
little
round
black
eye
looking
up
at
them
and
was
panting
as
if
his
little
heart
would
break
we
will
not
hurt
you
poor
little
thing
cried
fanny
as
her
brother
stooped
down
and
took
him
up
softly
in
both
hands
the
breast
panted
quicker
than
ever
and
every
now
and
then
he
gave
a
flutter
when
charles
tried
to
look
at
him
to
see
where
he
was
hurt
at
last
when
he
found
how
gently
he
was
held
and
that
all
they
did
to
him
was
to
smooth
down
the
feathers
of
his
back
and
wings
he
began
to
be
quiet
and
to
pant
less
and
gradually
to
cease
making
any
fluttering
now
then
said
charles
he
is
quiet
and
we
may
examine
him
so
he
slowly
began
to
open
his
hands
and
fanny
began
to
blow
the
little
bird
feathers
with
her
mouth
close
down
to
him
to
blow
them
on
one
side
that
they
might
see
where
he
was
hurt
but
no
bruise
or
scratch
could
be
found
presently
however
charles
said
o
i
see
what
has
happened
the
boys
in
running
after
him
have
trod
upon
his
feet
and
bruised
them
dreadfully
they
are
all
red
and
swelled
and
crooked
and
i
do
not
believe
they
can
ever
get
properly
well
again
his
little
claws
have
been
twisted
and
broken
he
will
never
be
able
to
hop
about
any
more
and
i
am
sure
he
can
never
perch
upon
a
twig
he
will
have
nothing
to
hold
fast
with
what
to
become
of
him
fanny
began
to
cry
as
she
heard
all
this
and
looked
at
the
bruised
feet
and
saw
how
badly
they
were
injured
he
will
die
said
she
if
we
let
him
go
he
will
never
be
able
to
get
up
to
his
nest
nor
hop
about
to
find
his
food
and
he
will
be
starved
do
charley
let
us
take
him
home
with
us
if
he
gets
well
enough
to
hop
and
fly
we
will
give
him
his
liberty
and
if
not
let
us
take
care
of
him
accordingly
home
they
all
went
carrying
the
bird
gently
wrapped
up
in
a
white
handkerchief
and
held
loosely
in
fanny
double
hands
so
as
not
to
press
him
when
they
arrived
they
suddenly
recollected
that
they
had
no
cage
for
him
and
did
not
know
where
to
put
him
not
knowing
what
to
do
as
their
papa
and
mamma
happened
both
to
be
out
charles
went
into
the
yard
to
ask
advice
to
his
great
joy
timothy
the
coachman
told
him
there
was
an
old
wire
lantern
hanging
up
in
the
stable
which
he
might
have
the
old
lantern
was
brought
and
some
hay
and
grass
were
laid
at
the
bottom
and
then
timothy
said
he
knew
of
a
chaffinch
nest
which
had
been
built
last
year
in
a
that
grew
up
one
side
of
the
stable
wall
and
they
might
get
it
down
and
put
this
little
lame
fellow
into
it
but
then
said
fanny
what
will
the
chaffinches
do
without
a
nest
o
you
do
understand
said
charles
it
is
an
empty
nest
made
last
year
it
has
no
owners
now
illustration
do
get
it
then
timothy
please
cried
fanny
away
went
timothy
for
the
old
chaffinch
nest
and
charles
with
him
while
fanny
remained
with
the
nestling
standing
beside
the
wire
lantern
they
soon
came
back
with
the
nest
which
fanny
placed
at
the
bottom
of
the
lantern
by
this
time
dowse
the
cook
came
into
the
yard
smiling
and
bringing
with
her
a
saucer
containing
bread
and
milk
and
a
quill
in
order
that
the
nestling
should
have
some
supper
o
thank
you
dowse
cried
fanny
i
had
quite
forgotten
that
he
would
want
something
to
eat
will
you
teach
us
how
to
feed
him
dowse
took
the
nestling
in
her
left
hand
and
a
quill
full
of
bread
and
milk
in
the
other
the
nestling
all
the
while
making
a
great
kicking
and
struggling
and
resistance
not
knowing
what
in
the
world
was
going
to
be
done
to
him
the
first
time
however
he
opened
his
bill
to
give
a
loud
chirrup
as
much
as
to
say
what
are
you
about
with
me
mrs
dowse
the
quick
fingers
of
the
smiling
cook
popped
a
quill
full
of
bread
and
milk
down
his
throat
in
a
moment
he
opened
it
wide
for
another
and
wider
still
for
another
and
yet
wider
still
for
one
more
there
was
an
end
of
all
his
resistance
he
had
found
out
what
dowse
wanted
to
do
to
him
and
was
very
much
pleased
at
it
in
this
way
he
was
fed
every
day
by
fanny
who
soon
learned
to
manage
it
very
neatly
the
papa
of
charles
and
fanny
used
to
call
the
nestling
the
little
foundling
and
so
did
their
mamma
but
fanny
and
charles
also
gave
him
the
name
of
chirp
poor
little
chirp
feet
did
not
get
well
he
still
continued
quite
lame
as
the
bones
of
his
claws
had
all
been
injured
severely
in
other
respects
he
was
very
well
ate
his
food
with
a
great
appetite
and
seemed
contented
and
happy
his
lantern
was
always
hung
in
the
by
the
stable
wall
every
fine
day
this
little
foundling
however
was
not
the
only
bird
in
the
house
fanny
uncle
had
brought
her
a
beautiful
canary
on
her
last
birthday
and
he
was
of
the
most
graceful
shape
the
most
delicate
yellow
color
and
the
most
clear
and
joyful
voice
that
ever
were
seen
or
heard
he
lived
in
a
large
cage
of
bright
brass
wire
which
had
a
circular
top
and
three
perches
one
perch
was
just
level
with
his
long
and
in
fact
led
up
to
it
the
second
perch
was
in
the
middle
of
the
cage
and
the
third
was
in
the
circular
top
which
arched
over
him
in
the
shape
of
a
bell
he
often
had
groundsel
and
chickweed
hung
in
the
wires
over
head
to
look
like
a
bower
and
opposite
this
top
perch
was
a
small
in
which
he
could
see
himself
he
had
a
hung
outside
his
cage
at
the
bottom
and
up
in
one
corner
a
round
to
wash
in
every
morning
he
had
his
bath
then
he
took
his
breakfast
then
he
hopped
up
to
the
top
perch
under
his
bower
and
set
his
feathers
all
to
rights
at
his
then
he
bowed
to
himself
once
or
twice
fancying
all
the
while
he
saw
another
canary
in
the
glass
then
he
polished
his
bill
upon
the
perch
to
complete
his
toilet
and
then
he
sang
himself
a
delightful
song
his
name
was
dicky
he
was
quite
a
gentleman
illustration
when
the
weather
was
fine
this
very
canary
bird
was
always
hung
in
a
whenever
he
found
himself
among
all
these
beautiful
green
leaves
he
sang
louder
and
more
joyfully
than
ever
fanny
and
charles
therefore
thought
it
was
a
pity
to
leave
the
poor
little
foundling
so
lonely
in
his
by
the
stable
and
accordingly
they
brought
his
funny
old
lantern
and
hung
it
upon
the
next
bough
to
the
one
that
held
the
cage
of
the
canary
and
there
all
day
the
poor
little
ragged
lame
sparrow
sat
looking
with
earnest
eyes
of
admiration
at
the
beautiful
canary
and
listening
with
the
greatest
wonder
and
pleasure
to
his
singing
he
only
now
and
then
ventured
when
the
canary
stopped
to
utter
his
chirp
as
much
as
to
say
more
more
they
were
hung
up
close
together
in
this
manner
almost
every
day
for
a
week
or
two
they
looked
at
one
another
very
much
the
nestling
sparrow
evidently
regarding
the
canary
with
great
admiration
and
the
canary
seeming
to
pity
and
be
sorry
for
the
poor
little
lame
foundling
one
day
fanny
said
to
her
brother
do
you
see
charley
how
these
birds
look
at
each
other
i
should
so
much
like
to
put
chirp
into
dicky
cage
i
have
been
thinking
of
the
very
same
thing
said
charles
let
us
run
and
ask
mamma
if
we
may
do
it
away
they
ran
and
asked
why
said
their
mamma
it
certainly
will
have
rather
a
strange
appearance
the
two
birds
do
not
seem
suitable
companions
it
is
an
odd
fancy
children
but
you
may
do
it
if
you
like
no
sooner
said
than
done
off
ran
fanny
and
charles
took
the
little
foundling
out
of
his
old
lantern
opened
the
door
of
dicky
cage
and
at
once
put
him
in
and
fastened
the
door
in
a
moment
dicky
flew
up
to
his
top
perch
and
stood
looking
down
very
earnestly
and
the
little
foundling
though
he
could
stump
about
on
his
lame
toes
never
moved
but
sat
looking
up
at
sir
dicky
the
nestling
looked
like
a
poor
little
ragged
lame
whom
a
sprightly
gentleman
in
a
bright
yellow
coat
had
been
so
compassionate
as
to
take
into
his
house
illustration
presently
the
foundling
went
to
the
and
looked
in
down
came
dicky
in
a
moment
and
drove
him
away
from
his
box
and
then
ascended
again
to
the
top
perch
this
happened
every
time
poor
chirp
went
near
the
seed
however
he
took
a
good
drink
out
of
the
at
which
both
fanny
and
charles
laughed
very
much
they
then
gave
the
foundling
some
food
through
the
wires
of
the
cage
this
they
had
to
do
for
several
days
till
dicky
at
last
became
more
and
no
longer
prevented
the
poor
lame
foundling
from
eating
out
of
his
they
gradually
became
very
good
friends
in
the
cage
though
dicky
except
for
his
bath
and
his
seed
was
almost
always
upon
the
perch
in
the
middle
or
the
top
of
the
cage
while
chirp
who
never
recovered
from
his
lameness
went
stumping
about
at
the
bottom
in
other
respects
however
the
foundling
grew
to
be
a
good
strong
sparrow
with
all
his
proper
feathers
and
made
a
clean
and
respectable
appearance
he
now
looked
like
a
stout
faithful
servant
in
a
brown
coat
who
inhabited
the
lower
story
while
the
gay
and
sprightly
owner
of
the
house
sat
in
the
upper
rooms
to
sing
or
dance
upon
two
perches
they
lived
very
happily
and
fanny
and
charles
rejoiced
that
they
had
brought
home
the
little
lame
foundling
winter
pleasures
do
jump
up
and
look
out
at
the
trees
said
susan
one
morning
in
december
to
little
mary
they
are
so
beautiful
all
sparkling
like
silver
it
seems
very
cold
said
mary
rather
sleepily
will
you
draw
up
the
blind
susan
that
i
may
see
out
susan
drew
up
the
blind
o
cried
mary
how
lovely
the
window
looks
i
see
fairy
palaces
and
wreaths
of
flowers
and
numbers
of
birds
and
bright
butterflies
o
and
look
at
those
angels
flying
with
white
wings
spread
and
below
them
there
is
a
lovely
lake
look
susan
do
you
see
what
i
mean
i
do
see
that
so
plain
replied
susan
but
i
see
a
pretty
cottage
just
there
in
the
corner
of
this
pane
o
yes
said
mary
and
look
there
is
a
high
mountain
behind
it
and
a
forest
of
tall
growing
all
up
the
sides
and
there
is
a
river
running
along
before
it
with
pretty
flowers
like
stars
on
its
banks
o
and
little
fairies
dancing
among
them
now
it
all
sparkles
like
diamonds
and
rubies
beautiful
beautiful
cried
mary
jumping
out
of
bed
the
sun
had
just
risen
and
his
beams
tinged
with
red
shone
on
little
mary
frosted
window
and
gave
it
this
beautiful
appearance
but
it
is
much
too
cold
to
stand
looking
at
it
dear
said
susan
make
haste
and
let
us
get
you
down
to
the
warm
parlor
fire
splash
went
mary
into
her
bath
and
made
all
the
haste
possible
and
while
she
was
dressing
the
window
was
a
continual
pleasure
for
as
the
sun
shone
on
the
glass
small
portions
of
the
melted
away
and
let
the
bright
rays
shine
through
and
first
these
clear
spots
looked
like
little
shining
stars
on
the
fairies
foreheads
then
like
stars
in
the
sky
then
they
changed
into
pretty
ponds
in
a
wood
then
into
lakes
with
rocky
banks
the
angels
seemed
to
fly
farther
away
the
wreath
of
flowers
took
different
forms
the
fairies
danced
off
with
the
birds
and
butterflies
and
at
last
just
as
the
largest
lake
had
become
so
large
that
mary
thought
it
must
be
the
sea
it
was
time
to
go
down
stairs
the
parlor
looked
so
very
comfortable
and
felt
so
warm
there
was
a
bright
fire
bouncer
was
stretched
on
the
rug
the
kettle
boiled
on
the
hob
breakfast
was
laid
the
sun
shone
in
at
the
lattice
window
and
now
mary
looking
out
into
the
garden
remembered
what
susan
had
said
about
the
trees
for
they
did
indeed
look
beautiful
every
branch
and
every
twig
was
incrusted
over
with
crystals
of
white
frost
they
no
longer
appeared
like
common
trees
no
wood
was
to
be
seen
they
seemed
to
have
been
changed
by
some
fairy
in
the
night
into
silver
and
sprinkled
with
diamonds
the
laurels
and
other
evergreens
had
all
their
leaves
covered
and
fringed
round
the
edges
with
the
same
silvery
sparkling
the
near
the
window
looked
the
best
of
all
their
dark
green
color
seemed
to
make
the
jewels
shine
more
brightly
and
then
their
pretty
forms
were
shown
off
by
all
this
ornament
as
mary
was
fancying
herself
in
some
fairy
palace
or
in
aladdin
garden
and
wondering
whether
there
was
any
fruit
made
of
precious
stones
hanging
on
the
trees
her
papa
and
mamma
came
down
to
breakfast
and
they
all
enjoyed
the
sight
together
mary
pretty
cousin
chrissy
who
had
been
on
the
first
of
may
was
on
a
visit
at
the
cottage
and
when
she
came
down
she
was
delighted
too
with
the
beautiful
sight
and
thought
the
branches
like
white
coral
tipped
with
diamonds
while
they
were
at
breakfast
mary
asked
the
question
which
she
had
asked
for
several
mornings
past
it
was
do
you
think
aunt
mary
and
thomas
and
willie
will
come
i
think
it
quite
possible
that
they
may
said
her
mamma
but
is
more
likely
you
had
better
try
not
to
expect
them
till
mary
said
chrissy
i
will
said
mary
but
i
think
i
do
expect
them
and
now
let
me
think
how
many
days
it
is
before
christmas
eve
will
come
yesterday
we
counted
it
was
eleven
days
so
it
is
ten
ten
days
but
you
know
mary
we
have
plenty
to
do
first
said
her
mamma
mary
nodded
and
smiled
christmas
eve
was
the
day
they
kept
at
the
cottage
because
papa
and
mamma
always
spent
christmas
day
with
grandmamma
she
lived
in
a
large
old
house
in
a
country
town
ten
miles
off
everything
in
her
house
was
clean
and
shining
the
rooms
smelt
very
sweet
and
grandmamma
was
very
kind
and
let
the
children
do
whatever
they
liked
and
her
two
maids
were
so
and
petted
them
and
there
were
always
such
nice
cakes
oranges
and
jellies
then
in
the
evenings
there
was
sure
to
be
a
magic
lantern
or
a
man
to
play
the
fiddle
in
short
going
to
grandmamma
was
a
very
great
pleasure
mary
now
asked
her
papa
to
come
down
to
the
pond
and
give
her
another
lesson
in
sliding
he
came
out
and
as
they
ran
along
they
found
numbers
of
things
to
admire
every
blade
of
grass
was
fringed
with
the
white
and
the
leaves
of
all
the
weeds
that
grew
near
the
hedges
looked
quite
pretty
with
their
new
trimming
but
above
all
the
mosses
in
the
little
wood
that
skirted
the
field
were
most
lovely
when
winter
strips
the
trees
of
their
leaves
then
the
little
bright
green
mosses
come
and
clothe
the
roots
and
stems
as
if
to
do
all
they
can
to
comfort
them
and
they
were
sparkling
all
over
and
seemed
to
be
dressed
out
for
some
festival
mary
and
her
papa
stopped
before
a
weeping
with
the
green
moss
growing
on
its
silvery
white
stem
after
admiring
it
for
some
time
they
looked
up
at
its
branches
that
hung
drooping
over
their
heads
how
light
and
feathery
they
look
said
mary
i
think
they
are
quite
as
pretty
as
in
summer
i
think
so
too
said
her
papa
i
even
think
the
birch
more
beautiful
in
winter
than
in
summer
and
all
the
trees
show
us
the
grandeur
and
beauty
of
their
forms
more
when
the
leaves
are
gone
look
at
their
great
sweeping
branches
yes
said
mary
and
then
all
the
little
twigs
look
so
pretty
and
like
and
more
than
ever
we
must
admire
them
said
her
papa
when
we
think
that
in
every
little
bud
at
their
tips
lie
the
young
leaves
folded
in
and
safely
shielded
by
this
brown
covering
from
the
cold
but
all
ready
to
burst
forth
when
the
soft
spring
air
and
sunshine
tell
them
it
is
time
mary
was
delighted
at
this
thought
and
they
spent
a
little
while
looking
at
the
different
buds
particularly
those
of
the
with
their
shining
brown
coats
mary
took
great
care
not
to
break
one
off
she
said
it
would
be
such
a
pity
the
little
leaves
should
not
feel
the
spring
air
and
come
out
in
the
sunshine
but
o
chrissy
what
a
lovely
bunch
of
jewelled
leaves
you
have
collected
cried
she
o
yes
that
branch
in
the
middle
will
look
pretty
it
has
managed
to
go
on
looking
like
coral
and
to
keep
its
diamonds
because
it
was
so
shaded
now
you
will
put
the
brown
oak
leaves
all
shining
here
are
some
more
put
these
and
then
the
pretty
little
brown
beech
leaves
glittering
all
over
it
looks
beautiful
how
pretty
the
form
of
the
oak
leaves
is
said
chrissy
now
let
us
take
it
in
to
mamma
cried
mary
but
remember
said
chrissy
if
we
take
it
in
all
its
charm
will
vanish
here
in
the
frosty
air
it
looks
as
if
it
had
been
dressed
up
by
the
fairies
but
in
the
warm
room
we
should
soon
have
nothing
but
a
bare
twig
and
a
few
withered
leaves
mary
looked
rather
sad
see
said
chrissy
let
us
fasten
it
to
the
top
of
your
favorite
seat
under
the
it
will
make
a
pretty
ornament
there
now
the
sliding
began
mary
papa
took
hold
of
her
hand
and
ran
with
her
along
the
field
till
they
came
to
the
edge
of
the
pond
then
away
they
went
sliding
side
by
side
he
kept
tight
hold
of
her
hand
for
she
could
not
help
tumbling
down
very
often
because
this
was
only
the
second
time
she
had
tried
once
they
both
very
nearly
had
a
tumble
for
bouncer
came
out
and
ran
bounding
and
barking
by
their
side
and
rushed
on
the
ice
with
them
but
he
suddenly
stopped
short
and
barked
as
if
to
say
how
is
this
what
makes
the
water
so
hard
this
morning
and
when
he
stopped
they
nearly
tumbled
over
him
but
they
managed
to
keep
up
after
sliding
till
mary
face
looked
like
a
apple
it
was
time
to
go
in
to
lessons
and
afterwards
they
took
a
walk
and
saw
some
gentlemen
and
boys
skating
on
the
large
pond
on
the
common
just
as
mary
mamma
said
they
must
go
home
the
london
coach
with
its
four
horses
came
gayly
along
the
hard
frosty
road
along
the
common
a
boy
on
the
top
waved
a
red
handkerchief
and
mary
cried
out
thomas
i
know
it
is
she
was
quite
right
for
the
coach
stopped
and
aunt
mary
and
willie
got
out
while
thomas
slid
down
from
the
roof
they
were
soon
shaking
hands
giving
kisses
and
kind
welcomes
and
all
walked
merrily
up
the
lane
and
had
a
very
happy
dinner
then
came
what
mary
called
happy
time
this
was
the
time
when
it
grew
dark
candles
were
brought
shutters
and
curtains
closed
and
they
all
collected
round
the
while
the
fire
blazed
the
kettle
boiled
and
everything
looked
bright
and
pleasant
this
evening
it
seemed
happier
than
ever
and
next
morning
it
was
delightful
to
awake
and
remember
who
had
come
to
the
cottage
and
to
see
the
party
at
breakfast
and
then
to
have
thomas
and
willie
to
slide
on
the
pond
mary
grew
quite
a
brave
slider
before
they
were
called
in
to
dinner
when
dinner
was
over
she
asked
her
mamma
whether
they
should
not
go
on
with
nice
work
this
evening
and
her
mamma
said
o
yes
they
must
or
they
should
not
be
ready
this
nice
work
was
preparing
a
number
of
presents
which
were
to
be
given
away
at
christmas
none
of
their
friends
had
been
forgotten
mary
was
busy
hemming
knitting
dressing
dolls
and
making
pincushions
her
mamma
was
also
hard
at
work
and
besides
was
often
cutting
out
and
fixing
and
had
a
village
girl
who
came
almost
every
day
for
work
making
frocks
and
different
things
chrissy
was
also
busy
making
all
kinds
of
pretty
things
when
aunt
mary
heard
of
it
she
said
we
are
all
at
work
in
the
same
way
thomas
has
brought
his
turning
lathe
and
a
few
tools
that
he
has
and
he
and
willie
are
very
busy
about
something
thomas
put
his
finger
on
his
lips
to
show
her
that
she
must
not
tell
what
that
something
was
and
willie
put
his
arms
round
her
neck
and
whispered
something
very
mysteriously
chrissy
and
mary
have
some
secret
too
said
mary
mamma
they
go
into
a
room
by
themselves
every
day
and
nobody
must
disturb
them
at
this
they
both
laughed
well
we
shall
know
about
it
all
on
christmas
eve
said
mary
and
then
besides
we
shall
see
somebody
mamma
says
somebody
that
is
coming
here
that
we
shall
like
very
much
and
that
we
know
and
yet
have
never
seen
is
it
a
gentleman
or
lady
asked
thomas
a
gentleman
said
mary
i
have
guessed
everybody
i
can
think
of
but
i
can
not
find
out
somebody
we
know
and
yet
have
never
seen
said
thomas
who
