nine
unlikely
tales
great
aunt
matilda
s
ears
were
red
and
shiny
so
were
her
cheeks
her
hands
were
red
too
this
was
because
pridmore
had
washed
her
it
was
not
the
usual
washing
which
makes
you
clean
and
comfortable
but
the
thorough
good
wash
which
makes
you
burn
and
smart
till
you
wish
you
could
be
like
the
poor
little
savages
who
do
not
know
anything
and
run
about
bare
in
the
sun
and
only
go
into
the
water
when
they
are
hot
matilda
wished
she
could
have
been
born
in
a
savage
tribe
instead
of
at
brixton
little
savages
she
said
don
t
have
their
ears
washed
thoroughly
and
they
don
t
have
new
dresses
that
are
prickly
in
the
insides
round
their
arms
and
cut
them
round
the
neck
do
they
pridmore
but
pridmore
only
said
stuff
and
nonsense
and
then
she
said
don
t
wriggle
so
child
for
goodness
pridmore
was
matilda
s
nursemaid
matilda
sometimes
found
her
trying
matilda
was
quite
right
in
believing
that
savage
children
do
not
wear
frocks
that
hurt
it
is
also
true
that
savage
children
are
not
gloved
booted
and
hatted
and
taken
in
an
omnibus
to
streatham
to
see
their
willoughby
this
was
intended
to
be
matilda
s
fate
her
mother
had
arranged
it
pridmore
had
prepared
her
for
it
matilda
knowing
resistance
to
be
vain
had
submitted
to
it
but
destiny
had
not
been
consulted
and
destiny
had
plans
of
its
own
for
matilda
when
the
last
button
of
matilda
s
boots
had
been
fastened
the
always
had
a
nasty
temper
especially
when
it
was
hurried
and
that
day
it
bit
a
little
piece
of
matilda
s
leg
quite
spitefully
the
wretched
child
was
taken
downstairs
and
put
on
a
chair
in
the
hall
to
wait
while
pridmore
popped
her
own
things
on
i
shan
t
be
a
minute
said
pridmore
matilda
knew
better
she
seated
herself
to
wait
and
swung
her
legs
miserably
she
had
been
to
her
willoughby
s
before
and
she
knew
exactly
what
to
expect
she
would
be
asked
about
her
lessons
and
how
many
marks
she
had
and
whether
she
had
been
a
good
girl
i
can
t
think
why
people
don
t
see
how
impertinent
these
questions
are
suppose
you
were
to
answer
i
m
top
of
my
class
auntie
thank
you
and
i
m
very
good
and
now
let
s
have
a
little
talk
about
you
aunt
dear
how
much
money
have
you
got
and
have
you
been
scolding
the
servants
again
or
have
you
tried
to
be
good
and
patient
as
a
properly
brought
up
aunt
should
be
eh
dear
illustration
matilda
swung
her
legs
miserably
try
this
method
with
one
of
your
aunts
next
time
she
begins
asking
you
questions
and
write
and
tell
me
what
she
says
matilda
knew
exactly
what
the
aunt
willoughby
s
questions
would
be
and
she
knew
how
when
they
were
answered
her
aunt
would
give
her
a
small
biscuit
with
carraway
seeds
in
it
and
then
tell
her
to
go
with
pridmore
and
have
her
hands
and
face
washed
again
then
she
would
be
sent
to
walk
in
the
garden
had
a
gritty
path
and
geraniums
and
calceolarias
and
lobelias
in
the
beds
you
might
not
pick
anything
there
would
be
minced
veal
at
dinner
with
bits
of
toast
round
the
dish
and
a
tapioca
pudding
then
the
long
afternoon
with
a
book
a
bound
volume
of
the
potterer
s
saturday
night
small
all
the
stories
about
children
who
died
young
because
they
were
too
good
for
this
world
matilda
wriggled
wretchedly
if
she
had
been
a
little
less
uncomfortable
she
would
have
cried
but
her
new
frock
was
too
tight
and
prickly
to
let
her
forget
it
for
a
moment
even
in
tears
when
pridmore
came
down
at
last
she
said
fie
for
shame
what
a
sulky
face
and
matilda
said
i
m
oh
yes
you
are
said
pridmore
you
know
you
are
you
don
t
appreciate
your
i
wish
it
was
your
aunt
willoughby
said
matilda
nasty
spiteful
little
thing
said
pridmore
and
she
shook
matilda
then
matilda
tried
to
slap
pridmore
and
the
two
went
down
the
steps
not
at
all
pleased
with
each
other
they
went
down
the
dull
road
to
the
dull
omnibus
and
matilda
was
crying
a
little
now
pridmore
was
a
very
careful
person
though
cross
but
even
the
most
careful
persons
make
mistakes
she
must
have
taken
the
wrong
omnibus
or
this
story
could
never
have
happened
and
where
should
we
all
have
been
then
this
shows
you
that
even
mistakes
are
sometimes
valuable
so
do
not
be
hard
on
people
if
they
are
wrong
sometimes
you
know
after
all
it
hardly
ever
happens
it
was
a
very
bright
green
and
gold
omnibus
and
inside
the
cushions
were
green
and
very
soft
matilda
and
her
nursemaid
had
it
all
to
themselves
and
matilda
began
to
feel
more
comfortable
especially
as
she
had
wriggled
till
she
had
burst
one
of
her
and
got
more
room
for
herself
inside
her
frock
so
she
said
i
m
sorry
i
was
cross
priddy
pridmore
said
so
you
ought
to
but
she
never
said
was
sorry
for
being
cross
but
you
must
not
expect
people
to
say
that
it
was
certainly
the
wrong
omnibus
because
instead
of
jolting
slowly
along
dusty
streets
it
went
quickly
and
smoothly
down
a
green
lane
with
flowers
in
the
hedges
and
green
trees
overhead
matilda
was
so
delighted
that
she
sat
quite
still
a
very
rare
thing
with
her
pridmore
was
reading
a
penny
story
called
the
vengeance
of
the
lady
constantia
so
she
did
not
notice
anything
i
don
t
care
i
shan
t
tell
her
said
matilda
she
d
stop
the
bus
as
likely
as
at
last
the
bus
stopped
of
its
own
accord
pridmore
put
her
story
in
her
pocket
and
began
to
get
out
well
i
never
she
said
and
got
out
very
quickly
and
ran
round
to
where
the
horses
were
they
were
white
horses
with
green
harness
and
their
tails
were
very
long
indeed
hi
young
man
said
pridmore
to
the
omnibus
driver
you
ve
brought
us
to
the
wrong
place
this
isn
t
streatham
common
this
isn
the
driver
was
the
most
beautiful
omnibus
driver
you
ever
saw
and
his
clothes
were
like
him
in
beauty
he
had
white
silk
stockings
and
a
ruffled
silk
shirt
of
white
and
his
coat
and
breeches
were
green
and
gold
so
was
the
hat
which
he
lifted
very
politely
when
pridmore
spoke
to
him
illustration
he
waved
away
the
eightpence
i
fear
he
said
kindly
that
you
must
have
taken
by
some
unfortunate
misunderstanding
the
wrong
when
does
the
next
go
back
the
omnibus
does
not
go
back
it
runs
from
brixton
here
once
a
month
but
it
doesn
t
go
but
how
does
it
get
to
brixton
again
to
start
again
i
mean
asked
matilda
we
start
a
new
one
every
time
said
the
driver
raising
his
hat
once
more
and
what
becomes
of
the
old
ones
matilda
asked
ah
said
the
driver
smiling
that
depends
one
never
knows
beforehand
things
change
so
nowadays
good
morning
thank
you
so
much
for
your
patronage
no
on
no
account
he
waved
away
the
eightpence
which
pridmore
was
trying
to
offer
him
for
the
fare
from
brixton
and
drove
quickly
off
when
they
looked
round
them
no
this
was
certainly
not
streatham
common
the
wrong
omnibus
had
brought
them
to
a
strange
neatest
sweetest
reddest
greenest
cleanest
prettiest
village
in
the
world
the
houses
were
grouped
round
a
village
green
on
which
children
in
pretty
loose
frocks
or
smocks
were
playing
happily
not
a
tight
armhole
was
to
be
seen
or
even
imagined
in
that
happy
spot
matilda
swelled
herself
out
and
burst
three
hooks
and
a
bit
more
of
the
shoulder
seam
the
shops
seemed
a
little
queer
matilda
thought
the
names
somehow
did
not
match
the
things
that
were
to
be
sold
for
instance
where
it
said
elias
groves
tinsmith
there
were
loaves
and
buns
in
the
window
and
the
shop
that
had
baker
over
the
door
was
full
of
grocer
and
the
wheelwright
seemed
to
have
changed
names
or
shops
or
miss
skimpling
dressmaker
or
milliner
had
her
shop
window
full
of
pork
and
sausage
meat
what
a
funny
nice
place
said
matilda
i
am
glad
we
took
the
wrong
a
little
boy
in
a
yellow
smock
had
come
up
close
to
them
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
very
politely
but
all
strangers
are
brought
before
the
king
at
once
please
follow
well
of
all
the
impudence
said
pridmore
strangers
indeed
and
who
may
you
be
i
should
like
to
know
i
said
the
little
boy
bowing
very
low
am
the
prime
minister
i
know
i
do
not
look
it
but
appearances
are
deceitful
it
s
only
for
a
short
time
i
shall
probably
be
myself
again
by
pridmore
muttered
something
which
the
little
boy
did
not
hear
matilda
caught
a
few
words
smacked
bed
bread
and
water
words
all
of
them
if
it
s
a
game
said
matilda
to
the
boy
i
should
like
to
he
frowned
i
advise
you
to
come
at
once
he
said
so
sternly
that
even
pridmore
was
a
little
frightened
his
majesty
s
palace
is
in
this
he
walked
away
and
matilda
made
a
sudden
jump
dragged
her
hand
out
of
pridmore
s
and
ran
after
him
so
pridmore
had
to
follow
still
grumbling
the
palace
stood
in
a
great
green
park
dotted
with
it
was
not
at
all
like
an
english
palace
james
s
or
buckingham
palace
for
instance
because
it
was
very
beautiful
and
very
clean
when
they
got
in
they
saw
that
the
palace
was
hung
with
green
silk
the
footmen
had
green
and
gold
liveries
and
all
the
courtiers
clothes
were
the
same
colours
matilda
and
pridmore
had
to
wait
a
few
moments
while
the
king
changed
his
sceptre
and
put
on
a
clean
crown
and
then
they
were
shown
into
the
audience
chamber
the
king
came
to
meet
them
it
is
kind
of
you
to
have
come
so
far
he
said
of
you
ll
stay
at
the
palace
he
looked
anxiously
at
matilda
are
you
comfortable
my
dear
he
asked
doubtfully
matilda
was
very
a
girl
no
she
said
my
frock
cuts
me
round
the
ah
said
he
and
you
brought
no
of
the
princess
s
old
ones
maid
no
doubt
a
loud
laugh
rang
suddenly
through
the
hall
the
king
looked
uneasily
round
as
though
he
expected
something
to
happen
but
nothing
seemed
likely
to
occur
yes
said
matilda
pridmore
dear
for
before
her
eyes
she
saw
an
awful
change
taking
place
in
pridmore
in
an
instant
all
that
was
left
of
the
original
pridmore
were
the
boots
and
the
hem
of
her
top
part
of
her
had
changed
into
painted
iron
and
glass
and
even
as
matilda
looked
the
bit
of
skirt
that
was
left
got
flat
and
hard
and
square
the
two
feet
turned
into
four
feet
and
they
were
iron
feet
and
there
was
no
more
pridmore
illustration
the
top
part
of
pridmore
turned
into
painted
iron
and
glass
oh
my
poor
child
said
the
king
your
maid
has
turned
into
an
automatic
it
was
too
true
the
maid
had
turned
into
a
machine
such
as
those
which
you
see
in
a
railway
grasping
things
which
take
your
pennies
and
give
you
next
to
nothing
in
chocolate
and
no
change
but
there
was
no
chocolate
to
be
seen
through
the
glass
of
the
machine
that
once
had
been
pridmore
only
little
rolls
of
paper
the
king
silently
handed
some
pennies
to
matilda
she
dropped
one
into
the
machine
and
pulled
out
the
little
drawer
there
was
a
scroll
of
paper
matilda
opened
it
and
don
t
be
she
tried
again
this
time
it
if
you
don
t
give
over
i
ll
tell
your
ma
first
thing
when
she
comes
the
next
go
along
with
you
worrying
so
then
matilda
yes
said
the
king
sadly
i
fear
there
s
no
doubt
about
it
your
maid
has
turned
into
an
automatic
nagging
machine
never
mind
my
dear
she
ll
be
all
right
i
like
her
best
like
this
thank
you
said
matilda
quickly
i
needn
t
put
in
any
more
pennies
you
oh
we
mustn
t
be
unkind
and
neglectful
said
the
king
gently
and
he
dropped
in
a
penny
you
tiresome
boy
you
leave
me
be
this
i
can
t
help
it
said
the
king
wearily
you
ve
no
idea
how
suddenly
things
change
here
it
s
i
ll
tell
you
all
about
it
at
go
with
nurse
now
my
dear
and
see
if
any
of
the
princess
s
frocks
will
fit
then
a
nice
kind
cuddly
nurse
led
matilda
away
to
the
princess
s
apartments
and
took
off
the
stiff
frock
that
hurt
and
put
on
a
green
silk
gown
as
soft
as
birds
breasts
and
matilda
kissed
her
for
sheer
joy
at
being
so
comfortable
and
now
dearie
said
the
nurse
you
d
like
to
see
the
princess
wouldn
t
you
take
care
you
don
t
hurt
yourself
with
her
she
s
rather
matilda
did
not
understand
this
then
afterwards
she
did
illustration
the
princess
was
like
a
yard
and
a
half
of
white
tape
the
nurse
took
her
through
many
marble
corridors
and
up
and
down
many
marble
steps
and
at
last
they
came
to
a
garden
full
of
white
roses
and
in
the
middle
of
it
on
a
green
eiderdown
as
big
as
a
feather
bed
sat
the
princess
in
a
white
gown
she
got
up
when
matilda
came
towards
her
and
it
was
like
seeing
a
yard
and
a
half
of
white
tape
stand
up
on
one
end
and
yard
and
a
half
of
broad
white
tape
of
course
but
what
is
considered
broad
for
tape
is
very
narrow
indeed
for
princesses
how
are
you
said
matilda
who
had
been
taught
manners
very
slim
indeed
thank
you
said
the
princess
and
she
was
her
face
was
so
white
and
thin
that
it
looked
as
though
it
were
made
of
an
her
hands
were
thin
and
white
and
her
fingers
reminded
matilda
of
her
hair
and
eyes
were
black
and
matilda
thought
she
might
have
been
pretty
if
she
had
been
fatter
when
she
shook
hands
with
matilda
her
bony
fingers
hurt
quite
hard
the
princess
seemed
pleased
to
see
her
visitor
and
invited
her
to
sit
with
her
highness
on
the
satin
cushion
i
have
to
be
very
careful
or
i
should
break
said
she
that
s
why
the
cushion
is
so
soft
and
i
can
t
play
many
games
for
fear
of
accidents
do
you
know
any
games
the
only
thing
matilda
could
think
of
was
cat
so
they
played
that
with
the
princess
s
green
her
fingers
were
much
cleverer
than
matilda
s
little
fat
pink
paws
matilda
looked
about
her
between
the
games
and
admired
everything
very
much
and
asked
questions
of
course
there
was
a
very
large
bird
chained
to
a
perch
in
the
middle
of
a
very
large
cage
indeed
the
cage
was
so
big
that
it
took
up
all
one
side
of
the
the
bird
had
a
yellow
crest
like
a
cockatoo
and
a
very
large
bill
like
a
toucan
if
you
do
not
know
what
a
toucan
is
you
do
not
deserve
ever
to
go
to
the
zoological
gardens
again
what
is
that
bird
asked
matilda
oh
said
the
princess
that
s
my
pet
cockatoucan
he
s
very
valuable
if
he
were
to
die
or
be
stolen
the
green
land
would
wither
up
and
grow
like
new
cross
or
how
horrible
said
matilda
i
ve
never
been
to
those
places
of
course
said
the
princess
shuddering
but
i
hope
i
know
my
all
of
it
asked
matilda
even
the
exports
and
imports
said
the
princess
goodbye
i
m
so
thin
i
have
to
rest
a
good
deal
or
i
should
wear
myself
out
nurse
take
her
so
nurse
took
her
away
to
a
wonderful
room
where
she
amused
herself
till
with
all
the
kind
of
toys
that
you
see
and
want
in
the
shop
when
some
one
is
buying
you
a
box
of
bricks
or
a
puzzle
kind
of
toys
you
never
get
because
they
are
so
expensive
matilda
had
tea
with
the
king
he
was
full
of
true
politeness
and
treated
matilda
exactly
as
though
she
had
been
grown
that
she
was
extremely
happy
and
behaved
beautifully
the
king
told
her
all
his
troubles
you
see
he
began
what
a
pretty
place
my
green
land
was
once
it
has
points
even
now
but
things
aren
t
what
they
used
to
be
it
s
that
bird
that
cockatoucan
we
daren
t
kill
it
or
give
it
away
and
every
time
it
laughs
something
changes
look
at
my
prime
minister
he
was
a
man
and
look
at
him
now
i
could
lift
him
with
one
hand
and
then
your
poor
maid
it
s
all
that
bad
why
it
laugh
asked
matilda
i
can
t
think
said
the
king
i
can
t
see
anything
to
laugh
can
t
you
give
it
lessons
or
something
nasty
to
make
it
miserable
i
have
i
do
i
assure
you
my
dear
child
the
lessons
that
bird
has
to
swallow
would
choke
a
does
it
eat
anything
else
besides
lessons
christmas
pudding
but
s
the
use
of
bird
would
laugh
if
it
were
fed
on
his
majesty
sighed
and
passed
the
buttered
toast
you
can
t
possibly
he
went
on
have
any
idea
of
the
kind
of
things
that
happen
that
bird
laughed
one
day
at
a
cabinet
council
and
all
my
ministers
turned
into
little
boys
in
yellow
socks
and
we
can
t
get
any
laws
made
till
they
come
right
again
it
s
not
their
fault
and
i
must
keep
their
situations
open
for
them
of
course
poor
of
course
said
matilda
there
was
a
dragon
now
said
the
king
when
he
came
i
offered
the
princess
s
hand
and
half
my
kingdom
to
any
one
who
would
kill
him
it
s
an
offer
that
is
always
made
you
yes
said
matilda
well
a
really
respectable
young
prince
came
along
and
every
one
turned
out
to
see
him
fight
the
dragon
as
much
as
ninepence
each
was
paid
for
the
front
seats
i
assure
you
the
trumpet
sounded
and
the
dragon
came
hurrying
up
a
trumpet
is
like
a
to
a
dragon
you
know
and
the
prince
drew
his
bright
sword
and
we
all
shouted
and
then
that
wretched
bird
laughed
and
the
dragon
turned
into
a
and
the
prince
killed
it
before
he
could
stop
himself
the
populace
was
what
happened
then
asked
matilda
well
i
did
what
i
could
i
said
you
shall
marry
the
princess
just
the
so
i
brought
the
prince
home
and
when
we
got
there
the
cockatoucan
had
just
been
laughing
again
and
the
princess
had
turned
into
a
very
old
german
governess
the
prince
went
home
in
a
great
hurry
and
an
awful
temper
the
princess
was
all
right
in
a
day
or
two
these
are
trying
times
my
i
am
so
sorry
for
you
said
matilda
going
on
with
the
preserved
ginger
well
you
may
be
said
the
miserable
monarch
but
if
i
were
to
try
to
tell
you
all
that
that
bird
has
brought
on
my
poor
kingdom
i
should
keep
you
up
till
long
past
your
proper
i
don
t
mind
said
matilda
kindly
do
tell
me
some
why
the
king
went
on
growing
now
more
agitated
why
at
one
titter
from
that
revolting
bird
the
long
row
of
ancestors
on
my
palace
wall
grew
and
vulgar
they
began
to
drop
their
h
s
and
to
assert
that
their
name
was
smith
from
clapham
how
dreadful
and
once
said
the
king
in
a
whimper
it
laughed
so
loudly
that
two
sundays
came
together
and
next
thursday
got
lost
and
went
prowling
away
and
hid
itself
on
the
other
side
of
and
now
he
said
suddenly
it
s
must
i
go
asked
matilda
yes
please
said
the
king
i
tell
all
strangers
this
tragic
story
because
i
always
feel
that
perhaps
some
stranger
might
be
clever
enough
to
help
me
you
seem
a
very
nice
little
girl
do
you
think
you
are
clever
it
is
very
nice
even
to
be
if
you
are
clever
your
aunt
willoughby
knows
well
enough
that
you
are
not
but
kings
do
say
nice
things
matilda
was
very
pleased
i
don
t
think
i
am
clever
she
was
saying
quite
honestly
when
suddenly
the
sound
of
a
hoarse
laugh
rang
through
the
banqueting
hall
matilda
put
her
hands
to
her
head
oh
dear
she
cried
i
feel
so
different
oh
wait
a
minute
oh
whatever
is
it
oh
then
she
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
she
looked
at
the
king
and
said
i
was
wrong
your
majesty
i
clever
and
i
know
it
is
not
good
for
me
to
sit
up
late
thank
you
so
much
for
your
nice
party
in
the
morning
i
think
i
shall
be
clever
enough
to
help
you
unless
the
bird
laughs
me
back
into
the
other
kind
of
but
in
the
morning
matilda
s
head
felt
strangely
clear
only
when
she
came
down
to
breakfast
full
of
plans
for
helping
the
king
she
found
that
the
cockatoucan
must
have
laughed
in
the
night
for
the
beautiful
palace
had
turned
into
a
butcher
s
shop
and
the
king
who
was
too
wise
to
fight
against
fate
had
tucked
up
his
royal
robes
and
was
busy
in
the
shop
weighing
out
six
ounces
of
the
best
for
a
child
with
a
basket
i
don
t
know
how
ever
you
can
help
me
now
he
said
despairingly
as
long
as
the
palace
stays
like
this
it
s
no
use
trying
to
go
on
with
being
a
king
or
anything
i
can
only
try
to
be
a
good
butcher
you
shall
keep
the
accounts
if
you
like
till
that
bird
laughs
me
back
into
my
palace
so
the
king
settled
down
to
business
respected
by
his
subjects
who
had
all
since
the
coming
of
the
cockatoucan
had
their
little
ups
and
downs
and
matilda
kept
the
books
and
wrote
out
the
bills
and
really
they
were
both
rather
happy
pridmore
disguised
as
the
automatic
machine
stood
in
the
shop
and
attracted
many
customers
they
used
to
bring
their
children
and
make
the
poor
innocents
put
their
pennies
in
and
then
read
pridmore
s
good
advice
some
parents
are
so
harsh
and
the
princess
sat
in
the
back
garden
with
the
cockatoucan
and
matilda
played
with
her
every
afternoon
but
one
day
as
the
king
was
driving
through
another
kingdom
the
king
of
that
kingdom
looked
out
of
one
of
his
palace
windows
and
laughed
as
the
king
went
by
and
shouted
butcher
illustration
the
king
sent
his
army
and
the
enemy
were
crushed
the
did
not
mind
this
because
it
was
true
however
rude
but
when
the
other
king
called
out
what
price
cat
s
meat
the
king
was
very
angry
indeed
because
the
meat
he
sold
was
always
of
the
best
quality
when
he
told
matilda
all
about
it
she
said
send
the
army
to
crush
so
the
king
sent
his
army
and
the
enemy
were
crushed
the
bird
laughed
the
king
back
into
his
throne
and
laughed
away
the
butcher
s
shop
just
in
time
for
his
majesty
to
proclaim
a
general
holiday
and
to
organise
a
magnificent
reception
for
the
army
matilda
now
helped
the
king
to
manage
everything
she
wonderfully
enjoyed
the
new
delightful
feeling
of
being
clever
so
that
she
felt
it
was
indeed
too
bad
when
the
cockatoucan
laughed
just
as
the
reception
was
beautifully
arranged
it
laughed
and
the
general
holiday
was
turned
into
an
income
tax
the
magnificent
reception
changed
itself
to
a
royal
reprimand
and
the
army
itself
suddenly
became
a
discontented
treat
and
had
to
be
fed
with
buns
and
brought
home
in
brakes
crying
something
must
be
done
said
the
king
well
said
matilda
i
ve
been
thinking
if
you
will
make
me
the
princess
s
governess
i
ll
see
what
i
can
do
i
m
quite
clever
i
must
open
parliament
to
do
that
said
the
king
it
s
a
constitutional
so
he
hurried
off
down
the
road
to
open
parliament
but
the
bird
put
its
head
on
one
side
and
laughed
at
him
as
he
went
by
he
hurried
on
but
his
beautiful
crown
grew
large
and
brassy
and
was
set
with
cheap
glass
in
the
worst
possible
taste
his
robe
turned
from
velvet
and
ermine
to
flannelette
and
rabbit
s
fur
his
sceptre
grew
twenty
feet
long
and
extremely
awkward
to
carry
but
he
persevered
his
royal
blood
was
up
no
bird
said
he
shall
keep
me
from
my
duty
and
my
but
when
he
got
there
he
was
so
agitated
that
he
could
not
remember
which
was
the
right
key
to
open
parliament
with
and
in
the
end
he
hampered
the
lock
and
so
could
not
open
parliament
at
all
and
members
of
parliament
went
about
making
speeches
in
the
roads
to
the
great
hindrance
of
the
traffic
the
poor
king
went
home
and
burst
into
tears
matilda
he
said
this
is
too
much
you
have
always
been
a
comfort
to
me
you
stood
by
me
when
i
was
a
butcher
you
kept
the
books
you
booked
the
orders
you
ordered
the
stock
if
you
really
are
clever
enough
now
is
the
time
to
help
me
if
you
won
t
i
ll
give
up
the
business
i
ll
leave
off
being
a
king
i
ll
go
and
be
a
butcher
in
the
camberwell
new
road
and
i
will
get
another
little
girl
to
keep
my
books
not
this
decided
matilda
she
said
very
well
your
majesty
then
give
me
leave
to
prowl
at
night
perhaps
i
shall
find
out
what
makes
the
cockatoucan
laugh
if
i
can
do
that
we
can
take
care
he
never
gets
it
whatever
it
ah
said
the
poor
king
if
you
could
only
do
when
matilda
went
to
bed
that
night
she
did
not
go
to
sleep
she
lay
and
waited
till
all
the
palace
was
quiet
and
then
she
crept
softly
pussily
mousily
to
the
garden
where
the
cockatoucan
s
cage
was
and
she
hid
behind
a
white
rosebush
and
looked
and
listened
nothing
happened
till
it
was
gray
dawn
and
then
it
was
only
the
cockatoucan
who
woke
up
but
when
the
sun
was
round
and
red
over
the
palace
roof
something
came
creeping
creeping
pussily
mousily
out
of
the
palace
and
it
looked
like
a
yard
and
a
half
of
white
tape
creeping
along
and
it
was
the
princess
herself
she
came
quietly
up
to
the
cage
and
squeezed
herself
between
the
bars
they
were
very
narrow
bars
but
a
yard
and
a
half
of
white
tape
can
go
through
the
bars
of
any
birdcage
i
ever
saw
and
the
princess
went
up
to
the
cockatoucan
and
tickled
him
under
his
wings
till
he
laughed
aloud
then
quick
as
thought
the
princess
squeezed
through
the
bars
and
was
back
in
her
room
before
the
bird
had
finished
laughing
matilda
went
back
to
bed
next
day
all
the
sparrows
had
turned
into
cart
horses
and
the
roads
were
impassable
that
day
when
she
went
as
usual
to
play
with
the
princess
matilda
said
to
her
suddenly
princess
what
makes
you
so
thin
the
princess
caught
matilda
s
hand
and
pressed
it
with
warmth
matilda
she
said
simply
you
have
a
noble
heart
no
one
else
has
ever
asked
me
that
though
they
tried
to
cure
it
and
i
couldn
t
answer
till
i
was
asked
could
i
it
s
a
sad
a
tragic
tale
matilda
i
was
once
as
fat
as
you
illustration
the
king
had
turned
into
a
villa
residence
i
m
not
so
very
fat
said
matilda
indignantly
well
said
the
princess
impatiently
i
was
quite
fat
enough
anyhow
and
then
i
got
but
how
because
they
would
not
let
me
have
my
favourite
pudding
every
what
a
shame
said
matilda
and
what
is
your
favourite
pudding
bread
and
milk
of
course
sprinkled
with
rose
with
in
of
course
matilda
went
at
once
to
the
king
and
while
she
was
on
her
way
the
cockatoucan
happened
to
laugh
when
she
reached
the
king
he
was
in
no
condition
for
ordering
dinner
for
he
had
turned
into
a
replete
with
every
modern
improvement
matilda
only
recognised
him
as
he
stood
sadly
in
the
park
by
the
crown
that
stuck
crookedly
on
one
of
the
and
the
border
of
ermine
along
the
garden
path
so
she
ordered
the
princess
s
favourite
pudding
on
her
own
responsibility
and
the
whole
court
had
it
every
day
for
dinner
till
there
was
no
single
courtier
but
loathed
the
very
sight
of
bread
and
milk
and
there
was
hardly
one
who
would
not
have
run
a
mile
rather
than
meet
a
even
matilda
herself
got
rather
tired
of
it
though
being
clever
she
knew
how
good
bread
and
milk
was
for
her
but
the
princess
got
fatter
and
fatter
and
rosier
and
rosier
her
gowns
had
to
be
let
out
and
let
out
till
there
were
no
more
turnings
in
left
to
be
let
out
and
then
she
had
to
wear
the
old
ones
that
matilda
had
been
wearing
and
then
to
have
new
ones
and
as
she
got
fatter
she
got
kinder
till
matilda
grew
quite
fond
of
her
and
the
cockatoucan
had
not
laughed
for
a
month
when
the
princess
was
as
fat
as
any
princess
ought
to
be
matilda
went
to
her
one
day
and
threw
her
arms
round
her
and
kissed
her
the
princess
kissed
her
back
and
said
very
well
i
sorry
then
but
i
didn
t
want
to
say
so
but
now
i
will
and
the
cockatoucan
never
laughs
except
when
he
s
tickled
so
there
he
hates
to
and
you
won
t
do
it
again
said
matilda
will
you
no
of
course
not
said
the
princess
very
much
surprised
why
should
i
i
was
spiteful
when
i
was
thin
but
now
i
m
fat
again
i
want
every
one
to
be
but
how
can
any
one
be
happy
asked
matilda
severely
when
every
one
is
turned
into
something
they
weren
t
meant
to
be
there
s
your
dear
s
a
desirable
prime
minister
was
a
little
boy
and
he
got
back
again
and
now
he
s
turned
into
a
comic
opera
half
the
palace
housemaids
are
breakers
dashing
themselves
against
the
palace
crockery
the
navy
to
a
man
are
changed
to
french
poodles
and
the
army
to
german
sausages
your
favourite
nurse
is
now
a
flourishing
steam
laundry
and
i
alas
am
too
clever
by
half
can
t
that
horrible
bird
do
anything
to
put
us
all
right
again
no
said
the
princess
dissolved
in
tears
at
this
awful
picture
he
told
me
once
himself
that
when
he
laughed
he
could
only
change
one
or
two
things
at
once
and
then
as
often
as
not
it
turned
out
to
be
something
he
didn
t
expect
the
only
way
to
make
everything
come
right
again
would
it
can
t
be
done
if
we
could
only
make
him
laugh
on
the
wrong
side
of
his
mouth
that
s
the
secret
he
told
me
so
but
i
don
t
know
what
it
let
alone
being
able
to
do
it
could
do
it
matilda
no
said
matilda
but
let
me
whisper
he
s
listening
pridmore
could
she
s
often
told
me
she
d
do
it
to
me
but
she
never
has
oh
princess
i
ve
got
an
the
two
were
whispering
so
low
that
the
cockatoucan
could
not
hear
though
he
tried
his
hardest
matilda
and
the
princess
left
him
listening
presently
he
heard
a
sound
of
wheels
four
men
came
into
the
wheeling
a
great
red
thing
in
a
barrow
they
set
it
down
in
front
of
the
cockatoucan
who
danced
on
his
perch
with
rage
oh
he
said
if
only
some
one
would
make
me
laugh
that
horrible
thing
would
be
the
one
to
change
i
know
it
would
it
would
change
into
something
much
horrider
than
it
is
now
i
feel
it
in
all
my
the
princess
opened
the
with
the
prime
minister
s
key
which
a
tenor
singer
had
found
at
the
beginning
of
his
music
it
was
also
the
key
of
the
comic
opera
she
crept
up
behind
the
cockatoucan
and
tickled
him
under
both
wings
he
fixed
his
baleful
eye
on
the
red
automatic
machine
and
laughed
long
and
loud
he
saw
the
red
iron
and
glass
change
before
his
eyes
into
the
form
of
pridmore
her
cheeks
were
red
with
rage
and
her
eyes
shone
like
glass
with
fury
illustration
four
men
came
wheeling
a
great
red
thing
on
a
barrow
nice
manners
said
she
to
the
cockatoucan
what
are
you
laughing
at
i
should
like
to
ll
make
you
laugh
on
the
wrong
side
of
your
mouth
my
fine
fellow
she
sprang
into
the
cage
and
then
and
there
before
the
astonished
court
she
shook
that
cockatoucan
till
he
really
and
truly
did
laugh
on
the
wrong
side
of
his
mouth
it
was
a
terrible
sight
to
witness
and
the
sound
of
that
laughter
was
horrible
to
hear
but
instantly
all
the
things
changed
back
as
if
by
magic
to
what
they
had
been
before
the
laundry
became
a
nurse
the
villa
became
a
king
the
other
people
were
just
what
they
had
been
before
and
all
matilda
s
wonderful
cleverness
went
out
like
the
snuff
of
a
candle
the
cockatoucan
himself
fell
in
half
of
him
became
a
common
ordinary
toucan
such
as
you
must
have
seen
a
hundred
times
at
the
zoo
unless
you
are
unworthy
to
visit
that
happy
place
and
the
other
half
became
a
weathercock
which
as
you
know
is
always
changing
and
makes
the
wind
change
too
so
he
has
not
quite
lost
his
old
power
only
now
he
is
in
halves
any
power
he
may
have
has
to
be
used
without
laughing
the
poor
broken
cockatoucan
like
king
in
english
history
has
never
since
that
sad
day
smiled
again
the
grateful
king
sent
an
escort
of
the
whole
army
now
no
longer
dressed
in
sausage
skins
but
in
uniforms
of
dazzling
beauty
with
drums
and
banners
to
see
matilda
and
pridmore
home
but
matilda
was
very
sleepy
she
had
been
clever
for
so
long
that
she
was
quite
tired
out
it
is
indeed
a
very
fatiguing
thing
as
no
doubt
you
know
and
the
soldiers
must
have
been
sleepy
too
for
one
by
one
the
whole
army
disappeared
and
by
the
time
pridmore
and
matilda
reached
home
there
was
only
one
left
and
he
was
the
policeman
at
the
corner
the
next
day
matilda
began
to
talk
to
pridmore
about
the
green
land
and
the
cockatoucan
and
the
but
pridmore
only
pack
of
nonsense
hold
your
tongue
do
so
matilda
naturally
understood
that
pridmore
did
not
wish
to
be
reminded
of
the
time
when
she
was
an
automatic
nagging
machine
so
of
course
like
a
kind
and
polite
little
girl
she
let
the
subject
drop
matilda
did
not
mention
her
adventures
to
the
others
at
home
because
she
saw
that
they
believed
her
to
have
spent
the
time
with
her
willoughby
and
she
knew
if
she
had
said
that
she
had
not
been
there
she
would
be
sent
at
she
did
not
wish
this
she
has
often
tried
to
get
pridmore
to
take
the
wrong
omnibus
again
which
is
the
only
way
she
knows
of
getting
to
the
green
land
but
only
once
has
she
been
successful
and
then
the
omnibus
did
not
go
to
the
green
land
at
all
but
to
the
elephant
and
castle
but
no
little
girl
ought
to
expect
to
go
to
the
green
land
more
than
once
in
a
lifetime
many
of
us
indeed
are
not
even
so
fortunate
as
to
go
there
once
whereyouwantogo
or
the
bouncible
ball
it
is
very
hard
when
you
have
been
accustomed
to
go
to
the
seaside
every
summer
ever
since
you
were
quite
little
to
be
made
to
stay
in
london
just
because
an
aunt
and
an
uncle
choose
to
want
to
come
and
stay
at
your
house
to
see
the
royal
academy
and
go
to
the
summer
sales
selim
and
thomasina
felt
that
it
was
very
hard
indeed
and
aunt
and
uncle
were
not
the
nice
kind
either
if
it
had
been
aunt
emma
who
dressed
dolls
and
told
uncle
reggie
who
took
you
to
the
crystal
palace
and
gave
you
five
bob
at
a
time
and
never
even
asked
what
you
spent
it
on
it
would
have
been
different
but
it
was
uncle
thomas
and
aunt
selina
aunt
selina
was
all
beady
and
sat
bolt
upright
and
told
you
to
mind
what
you
were
told
and
selim
had
been
named
after
near
as
they
could
get
and
uncle
thomas
was
the
one
thomasina
had
been
named
after
he
was
deaf
and
he
always
told
you
what
the
moral
of
everything
was
and
the
housemaid
said
he
was
i
know
he
is
worse
luck
said
thomasina
i
mean
miss
explained
the
housemaid
he
s
none
too
free
with
his
selim
groaned
he
never
gave
me
but
a
shilling
in
his
life
said
he
and
that
turned
out
to
be
bad
when
i
tried
to
change
it
at
the
the
children
could
not
understand
why
this
aunt
and
uncle
were
allowed
to
interfere
with
everything
as
they
did
and
they
quite
made
up
their
minds
that
when
they
were
grown
up
they
would
never
allow
an
aunt
or
an
uncle
to
cross
their
doorsteps
they
never
dear
little
some
day
they
would
grow
up
to
be
aunts
and
uncles
in
their
turn
or
at
least
one
of
each
it
was
very
hot
in
london
that
year
the
pavement
was
like
hot
pie
and
the
asphalt
was
like
hot
pudding
and
there
was
a
curious
wind
that
collected
dust
and
straw
and
dirty
paper
and
then
got
tired
of
its
collection
and
threw
it
away
in
respectable
people
s
areas
and
front
gardens
the
blind
in
the
nursery
had
never
been
fixed
up
since
the
day
when
the
children
took
it
down
to
make
a
for
a
play
they
were
going
to
write
and
never
did
so
the
hot
afternoon
sun
came
burning
in
through
the
window
and
the
children
got
hotter
and
hotter
and
crosser
and
crosser
till
at
last
selim
slapped
thomasina
s
arms
till
she
cried
and
thomasina
kicked
selim
s
legs
till
he
screamed
then
they
sat
down
in
different
corners
of
the
nursery
and
cried
and
called
each
other
names
and
said
they
wished
they
were
dead
this
is
very
naughty
indeed
as
of
course
you
know
but
you
must
remember
how
hot
it
was
when
they
had
called
each
other
all
the
names
they
could
think
of
thomasina
said
suddenly
all
right
silly
that
was
selim
s
pet
name
cheer
it
s
too
hot
to
cheer
up
said
selim
gloomily
we
ve
been
very
naughty
said
thomasina
rubbing
her
eyes
with
the
paint
rag
but
it
s
all
the
heat
i
heard
aunt
selina
telling
mother
the
weather
wore
her
nerves
to
that
just
meant
she
was
then
it
s
not
fault
said
selim
people
say
be
good
and
you
ll
be
happy
uncle
reggy
says
be
happy
and
perhaps
you
ll
be
could
be
good
if
i
was
so
could
i
said
thomasina
what
make
you
happy
said
a
thick
wheezy
voice
from
the
toy
cupboard
and
out
rolled
the
big
green
and
red
ball
that
aunt
emma
had
sent
them
last
week
they
had
not
played
with
it
much
because
the
garden
was
so
hot
and
when
they
wanted
to
play
with
it
in
the
street
on
the
shady
side
aunt
selina
had
said
it
was
not
like
respectable
children
so
they
weren
t
allowed
now
the
ball
rolled
out
very
the
bright
light
on
its
new
paint
seemed
to
make
it
wink
at
them
you
will
think
that
they
were
surprised
to
hear
a
ball
speak
not
at
all
as
you
grow
up
and
more
and
more
strange
things
happen
to
you
you
will
find
that
the
more
astonishing
a
thing
is
the
less
it
surprises
you
i
wonder
why
this
is
think
it
over
and
write
and
tell
me
what
you
think
selim
stood
up
and
said
halloa
but
that
was
only
out
of
politeness
thomasina
answered
the
ball
s
question
we
want
to
be
at
the
no
none
of
the
things
we
don
t
no
uncles
of
course
she
said
well
said
the
ball
if
you
think
you
can
be
good
why
not
set
me
bouncing
we
re
not
allowed
in
here
said
thomasina
because
of
the
crinkly
ornaments
people
give
me
on
my
well
the
street
then
said
the
ball
the
nice
shady
it
s
not
like
respectable
children
said
selim
sadly
the
ball
laughed
if
you
have
never
heard
an
ball
laugh
you
won
t
understand
it
s
the
sort
of
quicker
quicker
quicker
softer
softer
softer
chuckle
of
a
bounce
that
it
gives
when
it
s
settling
down
when
you
re
tired
of
bouncing
it
the
garden
then
it
said
i
don
t
mind
if
you
ll
go
on
talking
said
selim
kindly
so
they
took
the
ball
down
into
the
garden
and
began
to
bounce
it
in
the
sun
on
the
dry
yellowy
grass
of
the
lawn
come
on
said
the
ball
you
do
like
me
what
said
the
children
why
do
like
i
said
the
ball
that
s
higher
higher
for
then
and
there
the
two
children
had
begun
bouncing
as
if
their
feet
were
balls
and
you
have
no
idea
what
a
delicious
sensation
that
gives
you
higher
higher
cried
the
green
and
red
ball
bouncing
excitedly
now
follow
me
higher
and
off
it
bounced
down
the
blackened
gravel
of
the
path
and
the
children
bounced
after
it
shrieking
with
delight
at
the
new
feeling
they
bounced
over
the
three
of
the
children
looked
back
just
in
time
to
see
uncle
thomas
tapping
at
the
window
and
saying
don
you
have
not
the
least
idea
how
glorious
it
is
to
feel
full
of
bouncibleness
so
that
instead
of
dragging
one
foot
after
the
other
as
you
do
when
you
feel
tired
or
naughty
you
bounce
along
and
every
time
your
feet
touch
the
ground
you
bounce
higher
and
all
without
taking
any
trouble
or
tiring
yourself
you
have
perhaps
heard
of
the
greek
gentleman
who
got
new
strength
every
time
he
fell
down
his
name
was
antæus
and
i
believe
he
was
an
ball
green
on
one
side
where
he
touched
the
earth
and
red
on
the
other
where
he
felt
the
sun
but
enough
of
classical
research
thomasina
and
selim
bounced
away
following
the
bouncible
ball
they
went
over
fences
and
walls
and
through
parched
dry
gardens
and
streets
they
passed
the
region
where
fields
of
cabbages
and
rows
of
yellow
brick
cottages
mark
the
division
between
london
and
the
suburbs
they
bounced
through
the
suburbs
dusty
and
neat
with
geraniums
in
the
front
gardens
and
all
the
blinds
pulled
down
and
then
the
in
the
road
got
fewer
and
fewer
and
the
fields
got
greener
and
the
hedges
was
real
true
lanes
instead
of
roads
and
down
the
lanes
the
green
and
red
ball
went
bouncing
bouncing
bouncing
and
the
children
after
it
thomasina
in
her
white
starched
frock
very
prickly
round
the
neck
and
selim
in
his
a
little
tight
under
the
arms
his
sunday
one
was
a
size
larger
no
one
seemed
to
notice
them
but
they
noticed
and
pitied
the
children
who
were
being
taken
for
a
walk
in
the
gritty
suburban
roads
where
are
we
going
they
asked
the
ball
and
it
answered
with
a
sparkling
green
and
red
to
the
most
delightful
place
in
the
what
s
it
called
asked
selim
it
s
called
whereyouwantogoto
the
ball
answered
and
on
they
went
it
was
a
wonderful
and
down
looking
through
the
hedges
and
over
them
looking
in
at
the
doors
of
cottages
and
then
in
at
the
top
windows
up
and
and
at
last
they
came
to
the
sea
and
the
bouncing
ball
said
here
you
are
now
be
good
for
there
s
nothing
here
but
the
things
that
make
people
and
with
that
he
curled
himself
up
like
a
ball
in
the
shadow
of
a
wet
rock
and
went
to
sleep
for
he
was
tired
out
with
his
long
journey
the
children
stopped
bouncing
and
looked
about
them
oh
tommy
said
selim
illustration
they
bounced
through
the
suburbs
oh
silly
said
thomasina
and
well
they
might
in
the
place
to
which
the
ball
had
brought
them
was
all
that
your
fancy
can
possibly
paint
and
a
great
deal
more
beside
the
children
feel
exactly
as
you
do
when
you
ve
had
the
long
hot
dirty
train
every
one
has
been
so
cross
about
the
boxes
and
the
little
brown
portmanteau
that
was
left
behind
at
the
then
when
you
get
to
your
lodgings
you
are
told
that
you
may
run
down
and
have
a
look
at
the
sea
if
you
re
back
by
tea
time
and
mother
and
nurse
will
unpack
only
thomasina
and
her
brother
had
not
had
a
tiresome
there
were
no
nasty
stuffy
lodgings
for
them
and
no
tea
with
oily
butter
and
a
new
pot
of
marmalade
there
s
said
miles
of
and
rocks
said
he
and
and
caves
in
the
and
how
cool
it
is
said
thomasina
and
yet
it
s
nice
and
warm
too
said
selim
and
what
shells
and
and
the
downs
behind
and
trees
in
the
distance
and
here
s
a
dog
to
go
after
sticks
here
rover
a
big
black
dog
answered
at
once
to
the
name
because
he
was
a
retriever
and
they
are
all
called
rover
and
spades
said
the
girl
and
pails
said
the
boy
and
what
pretty
said
the
girl
and
a
grub
in
it
said
the
boy
so
they
sat
down
and
had
lunch
it
was
a
lovely
lunch
lobsters
and
strawberry
and
and
toffee
and
hot
buttered
toast
and
they
ate
and
ate
and
thought
of
the
aunt
and
uncle
at
home
and
the
minced
veal
and
sago
pudding
and
they
were
very
happy
indeed
just
as
they
were
finishing
their
lunch
they
saw
a
swirling
swishing
splashing
commotion
in
the
green
sea
a
little
way
off
and
they
tore
off
their
clothes
and
rushed
into
the
water
to
see
what
it
was
it
was
a
seal
he
was
very
kind
and
convenient
he
showed
them
how
to
swim
and
dive
but
won
t
it
make
us
ill
to
bathe
so
soon
after
meals
isn
t
it
wrong
asked
thomasina
illustration
the
seal
was
very
kind
and
convenient
not
at
all
said
the
seal
nothing
is
wrong
long
as
you
re
good
let
me
teach
you
most
glorious
game
so
cool
yet
so
exciting
you
try
at
last
the
seal
said
i
suppose
you
wear
they
re
very
inconvenient
my
two
eldest
have
just
outgrown
their
coats
if
you
ll
accept
and
it
dived
and
came
up
with
two
golden
sealskin
coats
over
its
arm
and
the
children
put
them
on
thank
you
very
much
they
said
you
i
am
almost
sure
that
it
has
never
been
your
luck
to
wear
a
fur
coat
that
fitted
you
like
a
skin
and
that
could
not
be
spoiled
with
sand
or
water
or
jam
or
bread
and
milk
or
any
of
the
things
with
which
you
mess
up
the
nice
new
clothes
your
kind
relations
buy
for
you
but
if
you
like
you
may
try
to
imagine
how
jolly
the
little
coats
were
thomasina
and
selim
played
all
day
on
the
beach
and
when
they
were
tired
then
went
into
a
cave
and
found
and
cucumber
and
and
then
they
went
to
bed
in
a
great
heap
of
straw
and
grass
and
fern
and
dead
leaves
and
all
the
delightful
things
you
have
often
wished
to
sleep
in
only
you
have
never
been
allowed
to
in
the
morning
there
were
for
breakfast
and
roast
duck
and
lemon
jelly
and
the
day
passed
like
a
happy
dream
only
broken
by
surprising
and
delightful
meals
the
ball
woke
up
and
showed
them
how
to
play
and
they
bounced
him
on
the
sand
with
shrieks
of
joy
and
pleasure
you
know
a
ball
likes
to
be
bounced
by
people
he
is
fond
is
like
slapping
a
friend
on
the
shoulder
there
were
no
houses
in
whereyouwantogoto
and
no
bathing
machines
or
bands
no
nursemaids
or
policemen
or
aunts
or
uncles
you
could
do
exactly
what
you
liked
as
long
as
you
were
good
what
will
happen
if
we
re
naughty
selim
asked
the
ball
looked
very
grave
and
i
must
not
tell
you
and
i
very
strongly
advise
you
not
to
try
to
find
we
won
we
won
t
said
they
and
went
off
to
play
rounders
with
the
rabbits
on
the
were
friendly
fellows
and
very
keen
on
the
game
on
the
third
evening
thomasina
was
rather
silent
and
the
ball
said
what
s
the
matter
out
with
so
she
said
i
was
wondering
how
mother
is
and
whether
she
has
one
of
her
bad
the
ball
said
good
little
girl
come
with
me
and
i
ll
show
you
he
bounced
away
and
they
followed
him
and
he
flopped
into
a
rocky
pool
frightening
the
limpets
and
dreadfully
though
he
did
not
mean
to
now
look
he
called
from
under
the
water
and
the
children
looked
and
the
pool
was
like
a
only
it
was
not
their
own
faces
they
saw
in
it
they
saw
the
at
home
and
father
and
mother
who
were
both
quite
well
only
they
looked
the
aunt
and
uncle
were
uncle
thomas
was
saying
what
a
blessing
those
children
are
then
they
know
where
we
are
said
selim
to
the
ball
they
think
they
know
said
the
ball
or
you
think
they
think
they
know
anyway
they
re
happy
enough
and
he
curled
himself
up
like
a
ball
in
his
favourite
the
two
children
crept
into
their
pleasant
soft
sweet
nest
of
straw
and
leaves
and
fern
and
grass
and
went
to
sleep
but
selim
was
vexed
with
thomasina
because
she
had
thought
of
mother
before
he
had
and
he
said
she
had
taken
all
the
they
went
to
sleep
rather
cross
they
woke
crosser
so
far
they
had
both
helped
to
make
the
bed
every
morning
but
neither
wanted
to
i
don
t
see
why
i
should
make
the
beds
said
he
it
s
a
girl
s
work
not
a
boy
i
don
t
see
why
i
should
do
it
said
thomasina
it
s
a
servant
s
place
not
a
young
lady
and
then
a
very
strange
and
terrible
thing
happened
quite
suddenly
out
of
nothing
and
out
of
nowhere
appeared
a
and
stern
and
very
neat
indeed
and
she
you
are
quite
right
miss
it
is
my
place
to
make
the
beds
and
i
am
instructed
to
see
that
you
are
both
in
bed
by
think
how
dreadful
this
must
have
been
to
children
who
had
been
going
to
bed
just
when
they
felt
inclined
they
went
out
on
to
the
beach
you
see
what
comes
of
being
naughty
said
thomasina
and
selim
said
oh
shut
up
do
illustration
suddenly
out
of
nothing
and
nowhere
appeared
a
large
stern
housemaid
they
cheered
up
towards
was
roast
pigeons
that
day
and
bread
sauce
and
whitebait
and
for
the
rest
of
the
day
they
were
as
good
as
gold
and
very
polite
to
the
ball
selim
told
it
all
about
the
dreadful
apparition
of
the
housemaid
and
it
shook
its
head
i
know
never
seen
a
ball
do
that
and
very
likely
you
never
will
and
my
bouncible
boy
you
may
be
happy
here
for
ever
and
ever
if
you
re
contented
and
good
it
s
a
quarter
to
ve
got
to
and
sure
enough
they
had
to
and
the
housemaid
put
them
to
bed
and
washed
them
with
yellow
soap
and
some
of
it
got
in
their
eyes
and
she
lit
a
and
sat
with
them
till
they
went
to
sleep
so
that
they
couldn
t
talk
and
were
ever
so
much
longer
getting
to
sleep
than
they
would
have
been
if
she
had
not
been
there
and
the
beds
were
iron
with
mattresses
and
hot
stuffy
fluffy
sheets
and
many
more
new
blankets
than
they
wanted
the
next
day
they
got
out
as
early
as
they
could
and
played
water
football
with
the
seal
and
the
bouncible
ball
and
when
came
it
was
lobster
and
ices
but
thomasina
was
in
a
bad
temper
she
said
i
wish
it
was
and
before
the
words
had
left
her
lips
it
was
cold
mutton
and
and
they
had
to
sit
up
to
table
and
eat
it
properly
too
and
the
housemaid
came
round
to
see
that
they
didn
t
leave
any
bits
on
the
edges
of
their
plates
or
talk
with
their
mouths
full
there
were
no
more
really
nice
meals
after
that
only
the
sort
of
things
you
get
at
home
but
it
is
possible
to
be
happy
even
without
really
nice
meals
but
you
have
to
be
very
careful
the
days
went
by
pleasantly
enough
all
the
sea
and
land
creatures
were
most
kind
and
attentive
the
seal
taught
them
all
it
knew
and
was
always
ready
to
play
with
them
the
taught
them
astronomy
and
the
taught
them
fancy
cooking
the
limpets
taught
them
dancing
as
well
as
they
could
for
their
lameness
the
taught
them
to
make
knowledge
they
have
never
needed
to
if
the
oysters
did
not
teach
them
anything
it
was
only
because
oysters
are
so
very
stupid
and
not
from
any
lack
of
friendly
feeling
the
children
bathed
every
day
in
the
sea
and
if
they
had
only
been
content
with
this
all
would
have
been
well
but
they
weren
t
illustration
a
long
pointed
thing
came
slowly
up
out
of
the
sand
let
s
dig
a
bath
said
selim
and
the
sea
will
come
in
and
fill
it
and
then
we
can
bathe
in
so
they
fetched
their
spades
and
there
was
no
harm
in
that
as
you
very
properly
remark
but
when
the
hole
was
finished
and
the
sea
came
creep
creep
creeping
at
last
a
big
wave
thundered
up
the
sand
and
swirled
into
the
hole
thomasina
and
selim
were
struggling
on
the
edge
fighting
which
should
go
in
first
and
the
wave
drew
sandily
back
into
the
sea
and
neither
of
them
had
bathed
in
the
new
bath
and
now
it
was
all
wet
and
sandy
and
its
nice
sharp
edges
rounded
off
and
much
shallower
and
as
they
looked
at
it
angrily
the
sandy
bottom
of
the
bath
stirred
and
shifted
and
rose
up
as
if
some
great
were
heaving
underneath
with
his
broad
back
the
wet
sand
slipped
back
in
slabs
at
each
side
and
a
long
pointed
thing
like
a
thin
cow
s
back
came
slowly
up
it
showed
broader
and
broader
and
presently
the
flakes
of
wet
sand
were
dropping
heavily
off
the
top
of
a
bathing
machine
that
stood
on
the
sand
over
where
their
bath
had
been
well
said
selim
we
ve
done
it
this
they
certainly
had
for
on
the
door
of
the
bathing
machine
was
painted
you
must
not
bathe
any
more
except
through
so
there
was
no
more
running
into
the
sea
just
when
and
how
they
liked
they
had
to
use
the
bathing
machine
and
it
smelt
of
stale
salt
water
and
other
people
s
wet
towels
after
this
the
children
did
not
seem
to
care
so
much
about
the
seaside
and
they
played
more
on
the
downs
where
the
rabbits
were
very
kind
and
hospitable
and
in
the
woods
where
all
sorts
of
beautiful
flowers
grew
there
was
nobody
to
say
don
t
when
you
picked
them
the
children
thought
of
what
uncle
thomas
would
have
said
if
he
had
been
there
and
they
were
very
very
happy
but
one
day
thomasina
had
pulled
a
lot
of
white
convolvulus
and
some
pink
geraniums
and
kind
you
are
never
allowed
to
pick
at
she
had
made
a
wreath
of
them
and
put
it
on
her
head
then
selim
said
you
silly
you
look
like
a
bank
and
his
sister
said
i
can
t
help
it
they
d
look
lovely
on
a
hat
if
they
were
only
artificial
i
wish
i
had
a
and
she
had
a
large
stiff
hat
that
hurt
her
head
just
where
the
elastic
was
sewn
on
and
she
had
her
stiff
white
frock
that
scratched
her
tiresome
underclothing
all
of
it
and
stockings
and
heavy
boots
and
selim
had
his
sailor
one
that
was
too
tight
in
the
arms
and
they
had
to
wear
them
always
and
their
fur
coats
were
taken
away
they
went
sadly
all
stiff
and
uncomfortable
and
told
the
bouncible
ball
it
looked
very
grave
and
great
tears
of
salt
water
rolled
down
its
red
and
green
cheeks
as
it
sat
by
the
wet
rock
oh
you
silly
children
it
said
haven
t
you
been
warned
enough
you
ve
everything
a
reasonable
child
could
wish
for
can
t
you
be
contented
of
course
we
can
they
so
they
a
day
and
a
half
and
then
it
wasn
t
exactly
discontent
but
real
naughtiness
that
brought
them
to
grief
they
were
playing
on
the
downs
by
the
edge
of
the
wood
under
the
heliotrope
tree
a
hedge
of
camellia
bushes
cast
a
pleasant
shadow
and
out
in
the
open
sunlight
on
the
downs
the
orchids
grew
like
daisies
and
the
carnations
like
buttercups
all
about
was
that
kind
of
turf
on
which
the
gardener
does
not
like
you
to
play
and
they
had
pulled
armfuls
of
lemon
verbena
and
made
a
bed
of
it
but
selim
s
blouse
was
tight
under
the
arms
so
when
thomasina
oh
silly
dear
how
beautiful
it
is
just
like
fairyland
he
silly
yourself
there
s
no
such
thing
as
just
then
a
fairy
with
little
bright
wings
the
colour
of
a
peacock
s
tail
fluttered
across
the
path
and
settled
on
a
magnolia
flower
oh
silly
darling
cried
thomasina
it
fairyland
and
there
s
a
fairy
such
a
beautiful
dear
she
but
selim
would
not
turned
over
and
hid
his
eyes
there
s
no
such
thing
as
fairyland
i
tell
you
he
grunted
and
i
don
t
believe
in
and
then
quite
suddenly
and
very
horribly
the
fairy
turned
into
a
every
one
knows
there
are
such
things
as
policemen
and
any
one
can
believe
in
and
all
the
rare
and
beautiful
flowers
withered
up
and
disappeared
and
only
thorns
and
thistles
were
left
and
the
misty
twiny
trim
little
grass
path
that
led
along
the
top
of
the
cliffs
turned
into
a
parade
and
the
policeman
walked
up
and
down
it
incessantly
and
watched
the
children
at
their
play
and
you
know
how
difficult
it
is
to
play
when
any
one
is
watching
you
especially
a
policeman
selim
was
extremely
vexed
that
was
why
he
said
there
couldn
t
possibly
be
as
big
as
bicycle
lamps
which
of
course
there
were
in
it
was
after
that
that
the
were
put
all
along
the
parade
and
a
pier
sprang
up
on
purpose
to
be
lighted
with
electricity
and
a
band
played
because
it
is
nonsense
to
have
a
pier
without
a
band
illustration
it
is
difficult
to
play
when
any
one
is
watching
you
especially
a
policeman
oh
you
naughty
silly
children
said
the
bouncible
ball
turning
red
with
anger
except
in
the
part
where
he
was
green
with
disgust
it
makes
me
bounce
with
rage
to
see
how
you
ve
thrown
away
your
chances
and
what
a
seaside
resort
you
re
making
of
and
he
did
bounce
angrily
up
and
down
the
beach
till
the
housemaid
looked
out
of
the
cave
and
told
the
children
not
to
be
so
noisy
and
the
policeman
called
now
then
move
along
there
move
along
you
re
obstructing
of
the
and
now
i
have
something
to
tell
you
which
you
will
find
it
hard
to
make
any
excuses
for
i
can
t
make
any
myself
i
can
only
ask
you
to
remember
how
hard
it
is
to
be
even
moderately
good
and
how
easy
it
is
to
be
extremely
naughty
when
the
bouncible
ball
stopped
bouncing
selim
i
wonder
what
makes
him
oh
no
t
cried
thomasina
for
she
had
heard
her
brother
wonder
that
about
balls
before
and
she
knew
all
too
well
what
it
ended
in
oh
she
said
oh
silly
he
brought
us
here
he
s
been
so
but
selim
said
nonsense
balls
can
t
feel
and
it
will
be
almost
as
good
to
play
with
after
i
ve
looked
inside
and
then
before
thomasina
could
prevent
him
he
pulled
out
the
knife
uncle
reggy
gave
him
last
holiday
but
one
and
catching
the
ball
up
he
plunged
the
knife
into
its
side
the
bouncible
ball
uttered
one
whiffing
squeak
of
pain
and
grief
then
with
a
low
hissing
sigh
its
kindly
spirit
fled
and
it
lay
a
lifeless
mass
of
paint
and
in
the
hands
of
its
assassin
thomasina
burst
into
the
heartless
selim
tore
open
the
ball
and
looked
inside
you
know
well
enough
what
he
found
there
emptiness
the
little
square
patch
of
that
makes
the
hard
lump
on
the
outside
of
the
ball
which
you
feel
with
your
fingers
when
the
ball
is
alive
and
his
own
happy
bouncing
cheerful
self
the
children
stood
looking
at
each
other
almost
wish
i
hadn
t
said
selim
at
last
but
before
thomasina
could
answer
he
had
caught
her
hand
oh
look
he
cried
look
at
the
it
was
indeed
a
dreadful
sight
the
beautiful
dancing
sparkling
blue
sea
was
drying
up
before
their
less
than
a
moment
it
was
quite
flat
and
dusty
it
hurriedly
laid
down
a
couple
of
railway
lines
ran
up
a
and
and
became
the
railway
at
the
back
of
their
house
at
home
the
children
gasping
with
horror
turned
to
the
downs
from
them
tall
yellow
brick
houses
were
rising
as
if
drawn
up
by
an
invisible
hand
just
as
treacle
does
in
cold
weather
if
you
put
your
five
fingers
in
and
pulled
them
up
but
of
course
you
are
never
allowed
to
do
this

turned
were

and
selim
found
themselves
at
the
iron
gate
of
their
own
number
in
the
there
was
uncle
thomas
at
the
window
knocking
for
them
to
come
in
and
aunt
selina
calling
out
to
them
how
far
from
respectable
it
was
to
play
in
the
streets
they
were
sent
to

at

uncle

thomasina
was
not

much
to
blame
as
selim
but
she
was
punished
just
the
same
i
can
t
help
that
this
is
really
the
worst
of
being
naughty
you
not

has
to
suffer
too

selina
the
blue
mountain
tony
was
young
tony
and
old
tony
was
his
grandfather
this
story
is
about
young
tony
and
no
human
being
believes
a
word
of
it
unless
young
tony
does
tony
was
born
in
the
town
of
antioch
this
is
not
the
same
antioch
that
you
read
about
in
history
but
quite
a
different
place
it
was
a
place
where
nearly
every
one
was
very
dark
as
to
the
complexion
and
rather
short
as
to
the
temper
and
figure
people
who
were
fair
in
the
face
and
easy
in
the
temper
were
not
thought
much
of
in
antioch
when
tony
s
mother
saw
that
her
baby
was
as
fair
as
a
daffodil
and
as
good
as
gold
and
laughed
all
day
she
said
oh
dear
oh
dear
i
suppose
he
takes
after
his
grandfather
he
is
not
in
the
least
like
family
and
the
matter
annoyed
her
so
much
that
she
died
then
there
was
only
old
tony
left
to
look
after
young
tony
because
his
father
had
been
killed
in
the
a
few
weeks
before
the
people
of
antioch
were
always
fighting
the
neighbouring
tribes
savages
who
deserved
no
better
fate
than
to
be
killed
only
of
course
sometimes
a
few
antiochians
had
to
be
killed
too
because
that
is
part
of
the
game
and
if
there
were
no
danger
there
would
be
no
glory
would
there
little
tony
s
hair
remained
yellow
and
his
habit
of
laughing
grew
with
his
years
and
he
learned
his
lessons
and
he
learned
his
play
he
was
excellent
company
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
yellowness
of
his
hair
and
the
gentleness
of
his
nature
he
would
have
been
quite
popular
among
his
schoolmates
his
grandfather
called
him
gentle
but
the
people
of
antioch
called
him
lazy
for
they
as
i
said
were
very
black
and
generally
angry
they
scurried
up
and
down
in
their
rocky
little
city
and
always
they
seemed
to
be
driven
by
most
urgent
affairs
hurrying
to
keep
important
appointments
they
ran
about
all
day
long
attending
to
their
business
and
hardly
stopping
even
for
their
dinner
or
their
tea
and
no
one
ever
saw
any
of
them
asleep
why
is
it
grandfather
young
tony
asked
one
day
what
is
it
all
about
why
do
they
never
sit
down
quietly
like
you
and
me
illustration
the
people
of
antioch
were
always
in
a
hurry
and
generally
angry
it
is
the
great
heart
of
the
nation
my
boy
said
old
tony
it
can
not
be
still
it
is
in
the
breed
you
know
they
can
t
help
it
they
are
all
alike
too
except
you
and
me
why
bless
your
heart
look
at
the
king
he
is
more
in
a
hurry
than
all
the
rest
and
more
noble
and
active
bless
the
old
man
ended
his
speech
in
quite
a
different
voice
from
the
one
he
had
begun
with
this
was
because
he
suddenly
caught
the
glitter
of
the
king
s
crown
as
the
monarch
popped
round
the
corner
the
king
of
antioch
was
always
in
a
hurry
always
running
somewhere
or
other
consequently
he
was
seldom
on
his
throne
and
his
loyal
subjects
had
to
look
out
very
sharply
for
he
was
always
sure
to
be
where
they
least
expected
him
you
may
think
that
they
could
have
got
over
this
little
difficulty
by
always
looking
for
the
king
where
they
least
expected
him
but
if
you
try
this
simple
experiment
for
yourself
with
your
governess
or
tutor
or
even
your
nurse
i
think
you
will
find
that
it
is
not
so
easy
as
it
looks
ha
said
the
king
standing
in
the
doorway
and
laughing
cheerfully
talking
treason
eh
well
you
know
what
the
punishment
for
that
is
pinching
with
black
pincers
you
know
you
don
t
feel
the
pinching
any
aha
your
majesty
always
has
such
a
pleasant
way
with
you
said
old
tony
politely
and
young
tony
decided
that
when
he
grew
up
he
would
try
not
to
have
any
pleasant
ways
at
all
the
king
rustled
quickly
round
the
little
house
and
looked
at
chairs
plates
and
pots
he
was
sorry
that
there
was
nothing
that
he
could
find
fault
with
so
he
said
beware
of
luxury
and
hurried
off
to
make
his
presence
felt
in
some
other
humble
home
there
was
no
pride
about
king
anthony
xxiii
he
just
dropped
in
without
an
invitation
and
took
his
subjects
as
he
found
them
king
anthony
xxiii
is
the
noblest
of
monarchs
said
old
tony
as
he
and
his
grandson
sat
down
to
their
plain
supper
it
s
all
right
grandfather
he
has
quite
gone
he
s
not
a
wonder
said
young
tony
meantime
the
king
was
hurrying
in
and
out
and
up
and
down
the
crowded
streets
of
his
city
picking
up
little
bits
of
information
and
making
his
subjects
feel
that
his
kingship
was
not
a
mere
matter
of
form
but
that
he
was
really
interested
in
the
most
humble
life
among
his
people
it
was
a
strange
town
all
and
with
steep
rocks
and
precipices
all
mixed
up
with
the
public
streets
the
people
for
all
their
busy
habits
had
no
trade
or
rather
they
did
not
manufacture
anything
they
built
houses
and
brought
up
their
families
they
wrapped
their
children
up
very
snugly
and
carried
them
about
at
an
earlier
age
than
we
consider
safe
and
they
milked
their
cows
which
were
large
and
green
and
had
wings
and
they
drank
the
milk
and
they
gathered
the
fruit
of
the
trees
that
grew
on
the
plain
below
the
town
and
they
got
on
very
well
indeed
there
was
only
one
drawback
to
life
in
antioch
and
that
was
its
uncertainty
at
any
moment
an
earthquake
might
occur
then
down
would
go
half
the
town
and
the
busy
citizens
had
it
all
to
build
again
they
soon
did
it
for
they
were
nothing
if
not
industrious
a
much
more
awful
thing
was
the
storm
of
hot
rain
that
now
and
then
fell
on
the
town
a
blighting
rain
that
killed
all
it
touched
this
was
more
dreaded
than
even
the
earthquakes
but
fortunately
it
very
seldom
happened
old
tony
was
beadle
and
sexton
and
keeper
of
the
town
records
and
very
nicely
he
kept
them
too
there
was
not
a
speck
of
dirt
on
one
of
them
he
used
to
spend
hours
and
hours
polishing
the
records
and
he
scoured
the
tombstones
till
they
shone
again
and
he
had
most
of
the
inscriptions
by
heart
after
an
earthquake
he
was
always
most
careful
to
put
the
tombstones
back
in
their
proper
places
and
one
day
when
he
was
doing
this
he
came
on
a
stone
he
did
not
remember
to
have
seen
before
he
called
to
young
tony
who
had
had
a
board
school
education
to
see
if
he
could
read
the
bits
of
words
that
were
carved
upon
it
it
seems
like
a
foreign
language
said
he
i
can
t
make
it
out
said
young
tony
it
is
not
carved
it
is
in
the
stone
somehow
looks
as
if
it
were
coming
through
from
the
other
he
turned
the
stone
over
and
there
on
the
other
side
was
an
inscription
which
both
of
them
had
read
a
hundred
times
here
lies
henry
birkbeck
magician
to
the
institute
however
humble
he
seems
to
you
his
last
foretelling
is
going
to
come
true
see
if
it
doesn
dear
me
said
old
tony
poor
old
henry
birkbeck
it
seems
like
yesterday
yes
he
was
very
respectable
but
only
in
a
small
way
of
business
a
magician
he
was
by
trade
but
no
one
thought
much
of
him
except
perhaps
the
king
and
never
gave
him
a
lift
he
used
to
do
things
with
eggs
and
a
hat
he
broke
the
eggs
as
often
as
not
and
the
goldfish
and
handkerchief
he
hardly
ever
brought
old
tony
began
to
lay
down
the
tombstone
but
young
tony
held
it
up
with
one
hand
and
tried
to
scrape
the
back
of
it
with
the
other
there
s
something
here
he
said
let
s
set
it
upright
instead
of
laying
it
down
and
i
will
scrub
it
and
see
what
the
letters
are
poor
old
birkbeck
i
wonder
what
his
last
foretelling
was
was
he
good
at
prophesying
grandfather
not
a
bit
said
the
sexton
and
to
do
him
justice
he
almost
gave
it
up
in
his
later
years
you
see
people
laughed
at
him
so
because
the
things
that
he
foretold
never
happened
towards
the
end
he
grew
very
prophesied
a
single
prophecy
from
one
year
s
end
to
another
sometimes
he
would
say
i
should
not
wonder
if
it
rained
before
sunday
but
then
he
never
wondered
at
anything
he
was
a
calm
old
man
was
poor
henry
it
took
a
good
deal
to
astonish
young
tony
tried
to
interest
his
boy
friends
in
the
back
of
poor
old
henry
birkbeck
s
tombstone
but
nobody
cared
they
were
all
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
to
care
for
an
occupation
so
slow
as
cleaning
tombstones
but
tony
worked
away
perseveringly
he
cleaned
it
with
soap
and
he
cleaned
it
with
soda
with
brickdust
and
vinegar
with
rotten
stone
and
washleather
with
patience
and
elbow
grease
and
the
last
two
as
you
know
will
clean
almost
anything
so
after
a
time
a
few
letters
began
to
show
distinctly
here
and
there
and
presently
tony
found
he
could
read
whole
words
there
was
milk
and
mountain
and
a
word
that
looked
like
jilk
only
of
course
it
could
not
be
that
and
the
last
word
of
all
was
reign
and
the
second
word
of
all
was
it
must
be
something
to
do
with
me
said
young
tony
because
of
my
name
being
in
it
must
have
something
to
do
with
the
king
said
old
tony
because
it
says
reign
so
you
d
better
cut
off
to
the
palace
and
look
sharp
about
it
or
his
majesty
will
know
the
reason
so
tony
looked
sharp
about
it
and
got
to
the
palace
in
less
than
five
minutes
for
a
wonder
the
king
was
not
engaged
in
dropping
in
on
his
subjects
but
was
on
his
throne
amid
his
fussy
black
courtiers
who
were
all
busy
trying
to
make
themselves
as
small
as
they
could
this
was
because
the
king
was
very
short
though
he
did
not
like
to
say
so
he
always
had
himself
described
in
the
census
and
the
palace
reports
as
a
powerful
man
of
middle
height
though
he
was
nowhere
near
the
middle
height
and
no
more
powerful
than
other
people
well
boy
said
king
anthony
what
have
you
come
here
for
there
is
a
prophecy
said
tony
there
are
a
good
many
said
king
anthony
but
they
don
t
amount
to
much
since
poor
henry
birkbeck
died
he
was
something
like
a
prophet
he
went
on
turning
to
his
courtiers
he
foretold
when
i
was
only
a
baby
that
if
i
grew
up
i
should
perhaps
be
king
the
late
king
my
father
was
very
pleased
i
the
courtiers
all
bowed
and
said
it
was
really
wonderful
tony
said
well
then
you
d
better
come
and
have
a
look
at
this
prophecy
because
it
is
the
late
birkbeck
s
last
one
and
he
said
it
ll
come
bring
it
here
can
t
you
said
the
king
no
i
can
t
said
the
boy
it
s
on
his
tombstone
so
there
i
can
t
carry
tombstones
no
said
the
king
thoughtfully
of
course
you
are
not
powerfully
built
you
are
nowhere
near
the
medium
come
and
look
at
it
if
you
want
to
said
tony
i
m
in
no
well
said
king
anthony
i
don
t
care
if
i
do
i
m
tired
of
sitting
so
off
they
all
went
king
court
heralds
and
spearmen
down
the
narrow
dark
crooked
town
streets
till
they
came
to
the
churchyard
where
the
tombstones
the
upright
and
the
flat
kind
tony
ran
on
ahead
and
knelt
in
front
of
the
tombstone
then
he
jumped
up
and
called
out
you
hurry
up
it
s
as
plain
now
as
the
nose
on
your
you
should
say
the
royal
nose
on
your
majesty
s
royal
face
said
old
tony
anxiously
but
the
king
was
too
interested
to
care
about
even
his
subjects
manners
illustration
off
they
all
went
king
court
and
he
came
up
to
the
tombstone
and
on
it
he
read
and
tony
read
and
all
the
courtiers
read
when
tony
drinks
the
blue
mountain
s
milk
he
shall
wear
a
sunday
suit
of
silk
he
shall
be
tallest
in
all
the
land
and
hold
the
town
under
his
command
he
shall
have
greatness
and
we
shall
have
grain
soon
may
it
happen
and
long
may
he
reign
hurrah
the
king
read
this
and
well
i
never
and
all
the
courtiers
said
the
same
tony
means
me
said
the
king
the
courtiers
said
that
of
course
it
did
i
am
king
tony
said
he
and
the
courtiers
said
of
course
he
was
they
all
spoke
at
once
like
a
chorus
i
was
christened
anthony
of
course
his
restless
majesty
went
on
fidgeting
with
his
gold
collar
but
i
know
that
my
subjects
have
always
spoken
of
me
behind
my
back
by
the
endearing
the
courtiers
assured
the
king
that
this
was
so
i
suppose
there
s
no
one
else
called
tony
the
king
turned
a
threatening
glance
on
the
crowd
and
every
one
hastened
to
say
no
there
wasn
but
old
tony
turned
extremely
pale
and
hurrying
into
the
vestry
he
tampered
with
the
register
of
births
and
altered
his
own
name
to
sydney
cecil
ernest
watchett
but
young
tony
spoke
up
my
name
s
tony
said
he
oh
is
it
said
his
majesty
we
ll
soon
see
about
that
guards
seize
him
now
what
is
your
name
tony
said
he
your
name
is
not
tony
said
the
king
your
name
he
could
not
think
of
a
name
at
the
moment
so
he
stopped
tony
said
my
name
is
take
him
to
the
parliament
house
said
the
king
beside
himself
with
rage
give
him
a
taste
of
the
mace
and
tony
tasted
the
mace
and
was
stamped
on
by
the
great
seal
who
was
very
fierce
and
lived
in
a
cage
at
the
parliament
house
until
he
was
stiff
and
sore
and
sorry
enough
to
be
glad
to
say
that
his
name
was
anything
the
king
liked
except
tony
which
of
course
it
never
never
could
have
been
he
admitted
at
last
that
his
name
was
william
waterbury
watchett
and
was
discharged
with
a
caution
illustration
tony
was
stamped
on
by
the
great
seal
who
was
very
fierce
but
my
name
tony
after
all
he
said
to
himself
as
he
went
home
full
of
sad
memories
of
the
mace
and
the
great
seal
i
wonder
where
the
blue
mountain
is
young
tony
thought
a
good
deal
about
poor
henry
birkbeck
s
prophecy
perhaps
the
great
seal
had
stamped
it
on
his
memory
anyway
he
could
not
forget
it
and
all
the
next
day
he
was
wandering
about
on
the
steep
edge
of
the
town
looking
out
over
the
landscape
below
it
was
not
an
interesting
landscape
all
round
the
brown
hill
where
the
town
was
lay
the
vast
forests
of
green
trees
something
like
bamboos
whose
fruit
the
people
ate
and
beyond
that
one
could
see
the
beginnings
of
a
still
larger
forest
where
none
of
the
people
of
antioch
had
ever
dared
to
forest
whose
leaves
were
a
hundred
times
as
big
as
the
king
himself
and
the
trunks
of
the
trees
as
big
as
whole
countries
above
all
was
the
blue
look
as
tony
would
he
could
see
no
blue
mountain
then
suddenly
he
saw
the
largest
forest
shake
and
enormous
leaves
swaying
this
way
and
that
it
must
be
an
earthquake
said
tony
trembling
but
he
did
not
run
away
and
his
valour
was
rewarded
as
valour
deserves
to
be
the
next
moment
the
vast
branches
of
the
enormous
forest
parted
and
a
giant
figure
came
out
into
the
forest
of
trees
it
was
a
figure
more
gigantic
than
tony
had
ever
imagined
possible
it
had
long
yellow
hair
in
its
hand
it
carried
a
great
white
bowl
big
enough
to
float
a
navy
in
if
such
an
expression
did
not
sound
rather
silly
i
should
say
that
this
figure
gave
tony
the
idea
of
a
it
sat
down
among
the
bamboo
forest
crushing
millions
of
trees
as
it
sat
with
a
spoon
twice
the
length
of
the
king
s
banqueting
hall
it
began
to
eat
out
of
the
tremendous
basin
tony
saw
great
lumps
like
blocks
of
soft
marble
balanced
on
the
vast
spoon
and
he
knew
that
the
was
eating
and
she
wore
a
giant
frock
and
the
frock
was
blue
then
tony
understood
this
was
the
blue
mountain
and
in
that
big
big
sea
of
a
basin
there
was
blue
mountain
s
milk
tony
stood
still
for
a
moment
then
turned
and
ran
as
hard
as
he
could
straight
into
the
royal
presence
to
be
more
exact
he
ran
into
the
royal
waistcoat
for
the
king
in
a
hurry
as
usual
was
coming
out
of
his
palace
gates
with
a
rush
the
king
was
extremely
annoyed
he
refused
to
listen
to
a
word
tony
had
to
say
until
parliament
had
been
called
together
and
had
passed
a
bill
strengthening
the
enactments
against
cheek
then
he
allowed
tony
to
tell
his
tale
and
when
the
tale
was
told
every
one
ran
to
the
battlements
of
the
town
to
look
there
was
no
blue
mountain
to
be
seen
illustration
the
then
his
majesty
told
tony
what
he
thought
of
him
and
it
was
not
pleasant
hearing
i
am
not
a
liar
said
tony
i
am
very
sorry
i
told
you
anything
about
it
i
might
jolly
well
have
gone
and
got
it
for
myself
name
he
stopped
in
confusion
i
should
think
it
was
said
the
king
if
there
is
any
mountain
which
i
don
t
for
a
moment
believe
you
had
better
go
and
fetch
me
some
of
the
milk
not
that
i
think
there
is
any
out
of
the
mountain
s
basin
which
i
can
not
believe
exists
outside
of
your
imagination
if
you
bring
it
to
this
address
you
will
be
suitably
all
right
said
tony
shall
i
fetch
it
in
a
jug
or
will
they
lend
me
a
can
i
will
lend
you
my
mug
said
the
king
and
mind
you
bring
it
back
so
tony
took
the
mug
it
had
for
a
good
little
king
a
present
from
antwerp
on
it
and
he
kissed
his
grandfather
and
started
off
on
his
long
perilous
journey
i
suppose
he
will
give
me
a
reward
if
i
get
it
he
thought
and
if
not
well
it
s
an
adventure
he
passed
through
the
crowded
streets
where
every
one
was
rushing
about
in
the
usual
frantic
haste
and
out
at
the
town
gates
and
down
the
road
into
the
forest
the
trunks
of
the
trees
towered
tall
and
straight
above
and
a
subdued
green
light
shone
all
about
him
the
ground
was
very
broken
and
uneven
and
often
tony
had
to
go
a
long
way
round
to
avoid
some
great
rock
or
chasm
but
he
travelled
fast
for
he
was
a
quick
walker
and
he
did
not
miss
the
way
once
although
of
course
it
was
quite
a
strange
country
to
him
there
had
been
evening
classes
at
his
school
to
teach
the
boys
the
art
of
finding
their
way
in
strange
places
and
tony
had
attended
all
the
lectures
and
taken
notice
as
well
as
notes
and
now
he
was
able
to
practise
what
he
had
learned
and
he
was
glad
he
had
not
wasted
his
time
in
drawing
pictures
of
the
masters
or
playing
nibs
with
the
boys
next
him
and
throwing
ink
pellets
at
more
studious
boys
but
the
journey
was
longer
than
he
expected
and
the
mug
was
rather
in
his
way
he
was
very
much
afraid
of
breaking
that
mug
it
is
an
awkward
thing
to
break
a
mug
with
a
present
for
a
good
king
on
it
it
is
so
difficult
to
replace
there
are
very
few
of
those
mugs
made
nowadays
there
is
little
or
no
demand
for
them
but
at
last
the
green
light
of
the
forest
began
to
grow
brighter
and
tony
saw
that
he
was
approaching
a
sort
of
clearing
among
the
trees
so
he
put
his
best
foot
foremost
without
stopping
to
think
which
was
his
worst
a
mistake
when
you
are
tired
and
footsore
and
now
he
came
out
from
under
the
tall
branches
and
saw
a
round
open
space
in
the
forest
where
millions
of
fallen
trees
lay
on
the
ground
and
he
knew
that
this
was
the
spot
where
the
mountain
had
sat
down
to
eat
its
unimaginable
enormous
breakfast
but
there
was
no
mountain
to
be
seen
and
tony
knew
that
he
could
do
nothing
but
sit
down
and
wait
in
the
hope
that
the
blue
mountain
would
come
next
morning
to
eat
its
breakfast
in
the
same
place
so
he
looked
about
for
a
place
to
rest
safely
in
and
presently
found
just
what
he
little
cave
whose
walls
and
roof
were
of
dried
there
he
stayed
all
that
day
and
night
eating
the
fruit
of
the
fallen
trees
and
next
morning
there
was
a
rustling
and
a
swaying
of
the
trees
and
the
blue
mountain
came
striding
over
the
tall
bending
down
the
forest
as
she
came
on
colossal
black
legs
and
massive
shoes
with
monstrous
ankle
straps
each
shoe
was
big
enough
to
have
crushed
a
hundred
tonys
at
one
step
so
he
hid
in
his
cave
and
presently
knew
by
the
shaking
of
the
ground
like
an
earthquake
that
the
mountain
had
sat
down
then
he
came
out
he
was
too
near
to
see
the
mountain
properly
but
he
saw
a
great
of
giant
frock
near
him
and
far
above
him
towered
the
blue
heights
of
the
s
knees
on
the
summit
of
these
shone
a
vast
white
great
basin
tony
started
to
climb
the
it
was
stiff
giant
starch
i
it
bore
his
weight
easily
but
it
was
a
long
climb
and
he
drew
a
deep
breath
of
thankfulness
when
he
reached
the
broad
of
the
s
now
the
smooth
china
roundness
of
the
big
basin
was
before
him
he
tried
its
polished
surface
again
and
again
and
always
fell
back
baffled
then
he
saw
that
he
might
climb
up
the
sleeve
of
the
gigantic
arm
whose
hand
held
the
basin
with
his
heart
in
his
mouth
he
began
the
ascent
slowly
and
carefully
holding
the
precious
mug
closely
to
his
breast
his
breath
came
faster
and
faster
as
he
went
up
and
up
and
at
last
stood
triumphantly
on
the
edge
of
the
great
blue
sleeve
from
there
to
the
edge
of
the
basin
it
was
easy
to
crawl
and
now
at
last
he
stood
on
the
giddy
verge
of
the
monstrous
basin
and
looked
down
at
the
lake
of
milk
with
the
rocks
of
bread
in
it
many
feet
below
the
great
height
made
him
giddy
he
lost
his
footing
and
still
clasping
the
mug
he
fell
headlong
into
the
the
bread
rocks
were
fortunately
soft
tony
picked
himself
up
he
was
wet
but
no
bones
were
broken
and
the
joy
the
mug
was
safe
tony
looked
it
over
anxiously
as
he
sat
on
a
rock
a
sloppy
and
uncertain
resting
place
there
was
only
one
small
crack
near
the
handle
and
tony
was
almost
sure
that
that
had
been
there
before
i
don
t
know
however
i
shall
get
out
again
said
tony
perhaps
i
never
shall
but
in
case
i
do
i
suppose
i
had
better
fill
the
mug
so
he
stooped
from
the
rocks
and
filled
the
mug
from
the
lake
of
milk
which
was
much
thicker
than
the
milk
of
the
green
cows
with
wings
the
only
milk
tony
was
used
to
he
had
just
filled
the
mug
and
tied
it
down
with
a
piece
of
parchment
which
he
had
taken
from
the
town
records
and
brought
with
him
for
the
purpose
when
a
noise
like
thunder
suddenly
broke
on
his
ear
and
indeed
it
very
nearly
broke
the
ear
itself
and
so
startled
tony
that
the
precious
mug
all
but
slipped
from
his
grasp
then
a
wave
of
milk
swept
up
almost
over
his
head
the
whole
of
the
massive
basin
was
moved
sideways
then
came
a
shock
like
an
earthquake
the
basin
was
being
set
on
the
ground
tony
felt
that
the
blue
mountain
had
seen
him
and
had
screamed
what
would
the
do
would
she
kill
him
if
so
how
these
questions
afforded
tony
food
for
some
interesting
reflections
during
the
next
few
moments
he
looked
round
him
for
a
way
of
escape
everywhere
towered
the
smooth
white
walls
the
tremendous
spoon
which
he
had
seen
the
blue
mountain
use
had
unfortunately
not
been
left
in
the
basin
or
he
could
have
climbed
out
by
that
he
gave
himself
up
for
lost
then
suddenly
he
saw
the
trunk
of
a
slender
tree
appear
at
the
edge
of
the
basin
it
was
pushed
down
towards
him
yes
on
to
the
very
on
which
he
crouched
would
it
crush
him
no
the
end
of
it
rested
on
the
rock
by
his
side
it
gently
moved
towards
him
he
saw
now
that
the
blue
mountain
was
not
cruel
she
was
not
bent
on
destroying
him
she
was
offering
him
a
way
of
escape
he
eagerly
climbed
the
tree
when
he
was
up
however
the
flung
the
tree
aside
and
with
tony
still
clinging
to
it
it
fell
crashing
into
the
forest
when
he
came
to
himself
he
almost
shouted
for
joy
to
find
the
mug
still
whole
illustration
tony
among
the
rocks
in
the
basin
he
never
knew
how
he
got
home
when
he
took
the
mug
to
the
king
the
monarch
looked
at
it
and
the
milk
s
very
it
s
giant
cow
s
milk
said
tony
you
drink
it
up
and
let
s
see
what
i
don
t
know
said
the
king
suspiciously
suppose
it
s
poison
i
shall
have
it
well
you
promised
me
a
reward
said
tony
and
you
wouldn
t
grudge
it
if
you
knew
what
a
time
i
ve
had
of
it
i
might
have
been
killed
you
said
the
king
who
had
been
looking
at
the
mug
when
you
have
cracked
my
own
only
mug
with
a
present
for
a
good
king
on
it
reward
indeed
a
stamp
from
the
great
seal
would
be
but
tony
was
gone
he
ran
home
to
tell
his
his
grandfather
was
not
a
letter
lay
on
the
kitchen
table
dear
grandson
it
said
the
king
has
found
out
that
my
name
was
entered
in
the
register
as
anthony
antrobus
and
he
refuses
to
believe
that
the
alteration
to
sydney
cecil
ernest
watchett
was
made
at
my
birth
so
i
am
seeking
safety
at
a
distance
i
have
only
one
piece
of
advice
to
give
you
so
loving
this
seemed
such
good
advice
to
tony
whose
name
was
also
in
the
register
that
he
was
just
going
to
take
it
when
the
door
was
flung
open
and
in
rushed
the
king
and
the
army
they
hustled
and
bustled
and
rustled
round
the
house
breaking
and
tearing
everything
and
when
there
was
nothing
more
to
spoil
they
carried
tony
off
to
prison
so
this
is
my
reward
for
getting
the
milk
for
him
said
poor
tony
to
himself
as
he
sat
in
prison
loaded
with
chains
and
waiting
for
his
trial
i
wish
i
had
drunk
the
milk
myself
this
is
what
comes
of
loyalty
but
i
don
t
care
my
name
is
tony
and
his
is
not
and
i
will
say
so
too
if
i
hang
for
acting
on
this
resolution
next
day
at
his
trial
tony
said
so
and
what
is
more
he
came
very
near
indeed
to
hanging
for
it
for
king
anthony
xxiii
was
furious
he
absolutely
danced
with
rage
and
it
took
six
prime
ministers
to
restrain
his
emotion
while
the
trial
went
on
tony
was
tried
for
an
attempt
to
murder
the
king
the
whole
thing
said
the
public
persecutor
was
nothing
but
a
plot
the
prophecy
of
henry
birkbeck
which
nobody
had
seen
till
tony
found
it
the
blue
mountain
which
nobody
but
tony
had
seen
at
all
the
thick
milk
so
mysteriously
obtained
all
pointed
to
dark
treason
and
villainy
the
crack
in
the
mug
was
a
peculiarly
incriminating
circumstance
i
can
not
help
the
long
persecutors
will
use
them
it
was
a
vile
plot
the
persecutor
said
but
it
had
failed
the
public
analyst
gave
evidence
that
the
milk
was
not
milk
at
all
but
some
explosive
substance
too
dangerous
to
analyse
tony
looked
at
the
jury
and
he
looked
round
the
court
and
he
saw
that
the
case
did
indeed
look
black
against
himself
when
he
was
asked
what
was
his
defence
he
there
is
no
pleasing
some
it
is
my
duty
to
caution
you
said
the
persecutor
that
everything
you
say
will
be
used
against
i
am
sure
it
will
said
tony
wearily
but
i
can
t
help
that
everything
i
do
is
used
against
me
too
i
needn
t
have
told
any
one
anything
about
it
i
might
have
got
the
milk
myself
and
been
king
but
i
got
it
for
him
and
i
did
not
crack
the
mug
at
least
i
am
almost
sure
not
i
only
wish
i
had
drunk
the
make
him
drink
it
now
shouted
a
thousand
voices
from
the
crowded
court
don
t
said
the
king
hastily
it
might
not
be
poison
after
you
can
t
have
it
both
ways
your
majesty
said
the
persecutor
bravely
either
it
is
poison
in
which
case
the
prisoner
deserves
to
drink
it
or
it
is
not
poison
in
which
case
the
prisoner
leaves
the
court
without
a
stain
upon
his
it
is
poison
illustration
everything
you
say
will
be
used
against
you
said
the
public
persecutor
it
isn
t
it
is
it
is
not
the
shouts
rose
louder
and
louder
it
is
not
poison
it
is
milk
cried
tony
and
suddenly
seizing
the
mug
of
milk
which
had
been
brought
into
the
court
to
give
its
evidence
he
lifted
it
to
his
lips
and
before
the
jailer
could
prevent
it
he
drained
the
milk
to
the
last
drop
and
ran
out
of
the
court
for
every
one
was
too
astonished
to
stop
him
the
moment
he
was
outside
he
felt
a
sudden
and
awful
change
in
himself
he
was
growing
growing
growing
he
hurried
out
of
the
town
he
felt
that
it
would
soon
be
too
small
to
hold
him
outside
he
got
bigger
and
bigger
till
the
trees
of
the
nearer
forest
were
like
grass
under
his
feet
and
the
mug
ran
out
of
his
hand
like
a
little
grain
of
and
there
beside
him
stood
the
little
girl
in
a
blue
he
was
taller
than
she
was
hullo
said
the
blue
mountain
where
did
you
spring
from
from
the
town
down
there
said
tony
there
said
the
mountain
stooping
that
s
not
a
town
silly
you
know
it
s
only
an
it
is
my
town
said
tony
and
its
name
is
antioch
and
then
he
told
her
the
whole
story
in
the
middle
of
it
she
sat
down
to
listen
better
crushing
millions
of
trees
as
she
sat
and
tony
sat
down
crushing
other
millions
only
now
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
sat
down
on
the
grass
it
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference
what
size
you
are
and
that
is
where
i
used
to
live
said
tony
pointing
to
the
town
and
my
name
is
i
know
that
said
the
blue
mountain
but
you
live
next
door
to
us
you
know
you
do
you
always
did
and
that
is
only
an
and
when
tony
looked
down
again
it
seemed
to
him
that
perhaps
it
really
was
only
an
all
the
same
he
knew
the
king
when
he
saw
him
hurrying
along
the
ramparts
and
he
picked
the
king
up
and
put
him
on
a
cow
s
ear
and
the
cow
scratched
its
ear
with
its
hind
foot
and
that
was
the
end
of
the
king
don
t
tease
the
ants
said
the
blue
mountain
people
pour
boiling
water
sometimes
or
dig
up
the
heaps
but
i
think
it
s
illustration
he
was
growing
growing
growing
tony
remembered
the
hot
rain
and
the
earthquakes
it
is
a
nice
story
she
said
of
course
the
grass
is
like
a
forest
to
the
ants
and
the
big
forest
is
the
hedge
your
sunday
suit
is
silk
velvet
your
aunt
told
mother
so
yes
it
is
a
nice
story
and
an
ant
did
drop
into
my
bread
and
milk
yesterday
though
i
don
t
know
how
you
you
mayn
t
believe
it
said
tony
but
i
shall
give
them
corn
because
it
says
so
in
birkbeck
s
prophecy
only
i
won
t
ever
give
them
any
milk
in
case
they
grow
big
they
are
too
just
think
if
the
king
had
been
our
size
oh
come
along
home
do
said
the
blue
mountain
a
little
crossly
i
am
tired
it
is
dinner
time
it
s
no
use
pretending
about
kings
and
things
you
know
well
enough
you
are
only
and
whatever
he
may
have
been
before
it
is
quite
certain
that
since
then
he
has
been
and
nothing
else
whatever
prince
two
mice
and
some
when
the
prince
was
born
the
queen
said
to
the
king
my
dear
do
be
very
very
careful
about
the
invitations
you
know
what
fairies
are
they
always
come
to
the
christening
whether
you
invite
them
or
not
and
if
you
forget
to
invite
one
of
them
she
always
makes
herself
so
terribly
my
love
said
the
king
i
will
invite
them
all
and
he
took
out
his
pen
and
wrote
out
the
cards
on
the
spot
but
just
then
a
herald
came
in
to
bring
news
of
war
so
the
king
had
to
go
off
in
a
hurry
the
invitations
were
sent
out
but
the
christening
had
to
be
put
off
for
a
year
at
the
end
of
this
time
the
king
had
subdued
all
his
enemies
so
he
was
very
pleased
with
himself
the
prince
was
a
year
old
and
he
also
was
pleased
with
himself
as
all
good
babies
are
and
found
the
little
royal
fingers
and
toes
a
fresh
and
mystery
and
the
queen
was
pleased
with
herself
as
all
good
mothers
should
everything
went
merrily
the
palace
was
hung
with
cloth
of
silver
and
strewn
with
fresh
daisies
in
honour
of
the
great
day
and
after
all
had
eaten
and
drunk
to
their
hearts
content
the
fairies
came
near
with
the
gifts
they
had
brought
to
their
godson
the
prince
he
shall
have
beauty
said
the
first
and
wit
said
the
second
and
a
pretty
sweetheart
said
the
third
who
loves
him
said
the
fourth
and
so
they
went
on
foretelling
for
him
all
sorts
of
happy
and
desirable
things
and
as
each
fairy
gave
her
gift
she
stooped
and
kissed
the
baby
prince
and
then
spreading
her
fine
wings
fluttered
away
across
the
rosy
garden
the
crowd
of
fairies
grew
less
and
less
and
there
were
only
three
left
when
the
queen
pulled
the
king
s
sleeve
and
whispered
my
dear
where
s
malevola
i
sent
her
a
card
said
the
king
casting
an
anxious
look
round
him
then
it
must
have
been
lost
on
the
way
said
the
queen
or
she
d
have
been
she
here
said
a
low
voice
in
the
queen
s
ear
suddenly
the
room
grew
dark
grey
clouds
hid
the
sun
and
all
the
daisies
on
the
floor
shut
up
quite
close
the
poor
queen
gave
a
start
and
a
scream
and
the
king
brave
as
he
was
turned
pale
for
malevola
was
a
terrible
fairy
and
the
dress
she
wore
was
not
at
all
the
thing
for
a
christening
it
was
made
of
spiders
webs
matted
together
dark
and
dank
with
the
damp
of
the
tomb
and
the
dust
of
dungeons
her
wings
were
the
wings
of
a
great
bat
spiders
and
newts
crawled
round
her
neck
a
serpent
coiled
about
her
waist
and
little
snakes
twisted
and
writhed
in
her
straight
black
hair
she
looked
at
the
queen
so
terribly
that
her
poor
cried
out
without
meaning
to
oh
don
t
she
cried
and
flung
both
arms
round
the
cradle
the
prince
was
quite
happy
playing
with
his
new
coral
and
bells
and
looking
at
the
palace
cat
who
sat
at
the
foot
of
the
cradle
washing
herself
now
listen
said
malevola
still
speaking
in
the
low
even
voice
that
was
so
terrible
you
did
not
invite
me
to
the
christening
i
ve
read
my
fairy
tales
and
i
know
what
s
expected
of
a
fairy
who
is
left
out
on
an
occasion
like
this
i
intend
to
curse
your
then
all
the
kings
and
queens
who
had
come
to
the
christening
wished
they
had
stayed
away
and
they
and
all
the
court
fell
on
their
knees
and
begged
malevola
for
mercy
as
for
the
three
good
fairies
who
were
left
they
hid
behind
the
and
the
court
ladies
peeping
between
their
fingers
fancy
deserting
their
godson
like
this
how
but
the
queen
and
the
king
only
wept
and
the
prince
played
with
his
rattle
and
looked
at
the
cat
then
malevola
said
mockingly
great
king
and
mighty
sovereign
malevola
was
not
good
enough
to
be
asked
to
your
but
your
family
shall
come
down
in
the
world
your
son
shall
marry
a
and
marry
a
lady
with
four
feet
and
no
a
shiver
of
horror
ran
through
the
room
and
malevola
vanished
then
suddenly
the
sun
came
out
and
people
lifted
up
their
heads
and
dared
again
to
look
at
each
other
and
the
daisies
too
opened
their
eyes
again
illustration
malevola
s
dress
was
not
at
all
the
thing
for
a
christening
then
the
good
fairies
came
out
from
behind
the
and
the
poor
queen
fell
on
her
knees
before
them
can
t
you
do
she
asked
can
t
you
undo
what
she
says
and
make
it
untrue
not
even
a
fairy
can
make
a
true
thing
untrue
said
the
good
fairies
sadly
malevola
s
words
will
come
true
but
the
prince
has
already
many
gifts
and
our
gifts
are
yet
to
give
and
these
you
shall
choose
whatever
you
wish
shall
be
then
the
king
recovering
a
little
from
the
terror
into
which
the
fairy
malevola
had
thrown
him
and
remembering
how
well
he
and
his
royal
line
had
always
borne
them
in
battle
said
at
let
the
boy
be
he
is
brave
said
one
of
the
good
fairies
he
fears
and
at
this
the
prince
ceased
to
feel
any
fear
of
the
palace
cat
he
put
out
his
hand
and
pulled
her
tail
so
merrily
that
pussy
turned
and
clawed
the
little
arm
till
the
blood
ran
oh
dear
cried
his
mother
he
is
fearless
as
you
say
i
wish
he
were
afraid
of
cats
poor
he
is
said
the
second
fairy
you
have
your
and
indeed
the
prince
screamed
and
hid
his
face
and
shrank
from
the
palace
cat
with
such
horror
that
the
king
pulled
out
his
pencil
and
and
wrote
an
edict
then
and
there
banishing
all
cats
from
his
dominions
but
all
the
same
he
was
very
angry
your
majesty
has
wasted
one
wish
he
said
very
politely
to
the
queen
let
us
now
leave
the
last
gift
in
the
hands
of
the
last
the
last
fairy
came
and
kissed
the
prince
who
was
now
sobbing
sleepily
he
shall
be
happy
she
said
he
shall
have
his
heart
s
then
she
too
vanished
and
the
kings
and
queens
took
their
leave
when
their
gold
coaches
came
for
them
and
presently
the
king
and
queen
were
left
alone
with
the
silver
hangings
and
the
strewn
daisies
and
the
baby
oh
dear
oh
dear
said
the
queen
this
is
dreadful
a
a
lady
with
four
feet
and
no
hands
at
least
we
are
not
likely
to
have
a
with
less
than
two
hands
said
the
king
we
might
arrange
only
to
have
said
the
queen
timidly
the
very
thing
the
king
answered
that
would
make
the
love
affair
all
that
one
could
wish
but
there
s
still
the
of
course
he
ll
marry
the
lady
he
it
s
not
the
way
of
the
world
said
the
king
at
any
rate
let
s
hope
he
ll
love
the
lady
he
marries
otherwise
what
said
the
queen
we
know
nothing
about
otherwise
do
we
my
queen
he
said
catching
her
round
the
waist
and
in
his
love
for
his
wife
and
his
son
the
king
felt
almost
happy
again
for
here
they
were
all
three
together
and
when
your
son
is
in
his
cradle
his
marriage
seems
very
far
off
indeed
but
the
queen
was
anxious
and
frightened
and
while
the
prince
was
still
a
child
she
sent
messengers
to
the
courts
of
all
the
neighbouring
kings
and
queens
to
tell
them
what
had
been
foretold
which
indeed
most
of
them
knew
having
been
at
the
christening
and
she
begged
such
of
them
as
had
daughters
to
send
them
as
that
so
the
prince
might
at
least
fall
in
love
with
a
real
princess
and
as
the
prince
grew
up
he
was
so
handsome
and
so
brave
fearing
nothing
but
cats
which
of
course
he
never
saw
though
he
dreamed
of
them
often
and
woke
screaming
and
also
so
brilliant
and
good
that
his
father
s
kingdom
being
beyond
compare
the
finest
in
all
the
round
world
the
young
daughters
of
kings
vied
with
each
other
as
to
who
should
find
favour
in
the
eyes
of
the
and
so
get
leave
to
serve
in
the
kitchen
each
nursing
the
hope
that
some
day
the
prince
would
see
her
and
love
her
and
perhaps
even
marry
her
and
he
was
very
good
friends
with
all
the
noble
but
he
loved
none
of
them
till
one
day
he
saw
at
a
window
of
the
tower
where
the
kitchen
was
a
bright
face
and
bright
hair
tied
round
with
a
scarlet
kerchief
and
as
he
looked
at
the
face
it
was
the
prince
had
lost
his
heart
he
kept
his
secret
safe
in
the
place
where
his
heart
had
been
and
schemed
and
plotted
to
see
this
fair
lady
again
for
when
he
went
among
the
royal
she
was
not
there
with
them
and
he
looked
morning
noon
and
evening
but
he
never
could
see
her
so
then
he
i
must
watch
o
she
is
kept
in
prison
in
the
tower
above
the
kitchen
and
at
night
those
who
watch
her
may
sleep
and
so
i
shall
be
able
to
talk
to
so
he
dressed
in
dark
clothes
and
hid
in
the
shadow
of
the
palace
courtyard
and
watched
all
one
night
and
he
saw
nothing
but
in
the
early
morning
when
the
setting
moon
and
the
rising
sun
were
mixing
their
lights
in
the
sky
he
heard
a
heavy
bolt
shot
back
and
the
door
of
the
kitchen
tower
opened
slowly
the
prince
crouched
behind
a
buttress
and
watched
and
he
saw
the
fair
maid
with
the
bright
hair
under
the
red
kerchief
she
swept
the
doorstep
and
she
drew
water
from
the
well
in
the
middle
of
the
courtyard
and
presently
he
crept
to
the
kitchen
window
and
saw
her
light
the
fire
and
wash
the
dishes
and
make
all
neat
and
clean
within
and
the
prince
s
eyes
followed
her
in
all
she
did
and
the
more
he
looked
at
her
the
more
he
loved
her
and
at
last
he
heard
sounds
as
of
folks
stirring
above
so
he
crept
away
keeping
close
to
the
wall
and
so
back
to
his
own
rooms
and
this
he
did
again
on
the
next
morning
and
on
the
next
and
on
the
third
morning
as
he
stood
looking
through
the
window
at
the
girl
with
the
bright
hair
and
the
bright
kerchief
the
gold
chain
he
wore
clinked
against
the
stone
of
the
the
maid
started
and
the
bowl
she
held
dropped
on
to
the
brick
floor
of
the
kitchen
and
broke
into
twenty
pieces
and
then
and
there
she
sat
down
on
the
floor
beside
it
and
began
to
cry
bitterly
the
prince
ran
in
and
knelt
beside
her
don
t
cry
dear
he
said
i
ll
get
you
another
it
isn
t
that
she
sobbed
but
now
they
ll
send
me
who
will
the
noble
they
keep
me
to
do
the
work
because
being
kings
daughters
they
don
t
know
how
to
do
anything
but
the
queen
doesn
t
know
that
there
is
a
real
here
and
now
you
have
found
out
they
will
send
me
and
she
went
on
crying
then
you
are
a
real
and
not
noble
at
all
said
the
prince
she
stopped
crying
for
a
minute
to
say
never
mind
said
the
prince
you
are
twice
as
pretty
as
all
the
kings
daughters
put
together
and
twenty
times
as
at
that
she
stopped
crying
for
good
and
all
and
looked
up
at
him
from
the
floor
where
she
sat
yes
you
are
he
said
and
i
love
you
with
all
my
and
with
that
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
and
the
real
laid
her
face
against
his
and
her
heart
beat
wildly
for
she
knew
what
the
prince
did
not
and
what
indeed
all
the
folk
knew
except
the
prince
that
this
had
been
foretold
at
his
christening
but
she
knew
also
that
though
he
loved
her
he
was
not
to
marry
her
since
it
was
his
dreadful
destiny
to
marry
some
one
with
four
feet
and
no
hands
i
wish
i
had
no
hands
and
four
feet
said
the
real
to
herself
i
wouldn
t
mind
a
bit
since
it
is
me
he
what
are
you
saying
asked
the
prince
i
am
saying
that
you
must
go
said
she
if
their
kitchen
highnesses
find
you
here
with
me
they
ll
tear
me
into
little
pieces
for
they
all
love
a
and
you
he
whispered
how
much
do
you
love
me
oh
she
answered
i
love
you
better
than
my
right
hand
and
my
and
the
prince
thought
that
a
very
strange
answer
he
went
through
that
day
in
a
happy
dream
but
he
did
not
tell
his
dream
to
any
one
lest
some
harm
should
come
to
the
real
for
he
meant
to
marry
her
and
he
had
a
feeling
that
his
parents
would
not
approve
of
the
match
now
that
night
when
the
whole
palace
was
asleep
the
real
got
up
and
crept
out
past
the
sleepy
sentinel
and
went
home
to
her
father
the
farmer
and
got
one
of
his
great
white
cart
horses
and
rode
away
through
the
woods
to
the
cavern
where
the
great
white
rat
sits
sleeplessly
guarding
the
magic
cat
and
every
one
wondered
why
he
guarded
it
so
carefully
for
it
seemed
to
have
no
great
value
but
the
great
white
rat
watched
it
constantly
without
ever
closing
one
of
those
round
bright
rat
of
his
and
when
folk
sought
to
lay
hands
on
it
he
be
careful
it
has
the
power
to
change
you
into
a
on
which
folk
dropped
it
hastily
and
went
their
ways
leaving
him
still
on
guard
to
him
now
went
the
little
and
asked
for
help
for
he
was
thousands
of
years
old
and
had
more
wisdom
between
his
nose
and
ears
than
all
the
books
in
all
the
world
she
told
him
all
that
had
happened
now
what
shall
i
do
she
said
and
the
great
white
rat
never
shifting
his
eyes
from
the
magic
cat
keep
your
own
counsel
and
be
contented
the
prince
loves
but
said
the
real
he
is
not
to
marry
me
but
a
horrible
creature
with
four
feet
and
no
keep
your
secret
and
be
content
the
great
white
rat
repeated
and
if
ever
you
see
him
in
danger
from
a
lady
with
four
feet
and
no
hands
come
straight
to
so
the
real
went
back
to
the
palace
and
set
to
work
to
clean
pots
and
pans
for
now
it
was
bright
dewy
daylight
and
the
night
had
gone
and
before
the
rest
were
awake
again
her
prince
came
to
her
and
vowed
he
loved
her
more
than
life
so
she
kept
her
secret
and
was
content
at
the
time
of
the
prince
s
christening
the
king
had
banished
all
cats
from
the
kingdom
because
he
could
not
bear
to
see
his
son
show
fear
of
anything
but
now
and
then
strangers
not
knowing
of
the
edict
brought
cats
to
that
country
and
if
the
prince
saw
one
of
these
cats
he
was
taken
with
a
trembling
and
a
paleness
standing
like
stone
awhile
and
presently
with
shrieks
of
terror
fleeing
the
spot
and
it
was
now
a
long
time
since
he
had
seen
a
cat
now
soon
after
the
prince
had
found
out
how
he
loved
the
real
his
father
and
mother
died
suddenly
as
they
were
sitting
hand
in
hand
for
they
loved
each
other
so
much
that
it
was
not
possible
for
either
to
stay
here
without
the
other
so
then
the
prince
wept
bitterly
and
would
not
be
comforted
and
the
court
stood
about
him
with
a
long
face
wearing
its
new
mourning
and
as
he
sat
there
with
his
face
hidden
something
came
through
the
palace
gate
and
up
the
marble
stairs
and
into
the
great
hall
where
the
prince
sat
on
the
steps
of
his
father
s
throne
weeping
and
before
the
courtiers
could
draw
breath
or
decide
whether
it
was
court
etiquette
for
them
to
do
anything
while
the
prince
was
crying
except
to
stand
still
and
look
sad
the
creature
came
up
to
the
prince
and
began
to
rub
itself
against
his
arm
and
he
still
hiding
his
face
reached
out
his
hand
and
stroked
it
then
all
the
court
drew
a
deep
breath
for
they
saw
that
the
thing
that
had
come
in
was
a
great
black
cat
and
the
prince
raised
his
eyes
and
they
looked
to
see
him
shrink
and
shriek
but
instead
he
passed
his
hand
over
the
black
fur
and
poor
pussy
then
and
at
these
words
the
whole
court
window
and
door
the
courtiers
took
horse
those
who
had
carriages
went
away
in
them
those
who
had
none
went
on
foot
and
in
less
than
a
minute
the
prince
and
the
cat
were
left
alone
together
for
the
court
was
learned
in
witch
law
and
knowing
the
prince
s
horror
of
cats
it
saw
at
once
that
a
cat
he
was
not
afraid
of
was
no
cat
at
all
but
a
witch
in
that
shape
therefore
the
courtiers
and
the
whole
royal
household
fled
trembling
and
hid
themselves
all
but
the
little
real
she
saw
with
terror
that
the
cat
or
rather
the
witch
in
cat
s
shape
had
done
what
no
one
else
could
the
prince
from
his
dull
dream
of
grief
and
then
she
remembered
the
fate
which
malevola
had
foretold
for
he
should
marry
a
lady
with
four
feet
and
no
hands
she
cried
this
witch
has
four
feet
and
no
hands
but
she
can
have
hands
whenever
she
chooses
and
be
a
woman
by
her
magic
arts
as
easily
as
she
can
be
a
cat
and
then
he
will
love
what
will
become
of
me
or
worse
she
may
marry
him
only
to
torment
him
she
may
shut
him
up
in
some
enchanted
dungeon
far
from
the
light
of
day
such
things
have
happened
before
so
she
stood
hidden
by
the
blue
arras
and
wrung
her
hands
and
the
tears
ran
down
her
cheeks
and
all
the
time
the
black
cat
purred
to
the
prince
and
the
prince
stroked
the
black
cat
and
any
one
could
have
seen
that
he
was
every
moment
becoming
more
deeply
bewitched
and
still
the
real
crouched
behind
the
arras
and
her
heart
ached
that
it
knew
no
way
to
save
him
then
suddenly
she
remembered
the
words
of
the
great
white
if
ever
you
see
him
in
danger
from
a
lady
with
four
feet
and
no
hands
come
straight
to
now
surely
was
the
time
for
the
prince
she
knew
was
in
desperate
danger
the
real
crept
silently
down
the
marble
stairs
but
once
she
was
out
of
the
palace
she
ran
like
the
wind
to
the
stable
no
men
were
about
had
followed
the
example
of
the
court
and
had
run
away
when
they
heard
of
the
strange
coming
of
the
and
of
all
the
many
horses
that
had
stood
in
the
stable
only
one
remained
for
each
man
in
his
fright
had
saddled
the
first
horse
that
came
to
hand
and
ridden
off
on
it
and
the
one
that
still
stayed
there
was
the
prince
s
own
black
charger
he
had
had
no
mind
to
be
saddled
in
haste
by
a
stranger
and
had
turned
and
bitten
the
stranger
who
had
attempted
it
so
he
was
there
alone
now
the
little
lifted
the
prince
s
saddle
from
its
perch
and
the
weight
of
it
was
such
that
she
could
not
have
carried
it
but
for
the
heavy
heart
she
bore
because
of
her
love
to
the
prince
and
his
danger
and
that
made
all
else
seem
light
she
put
the
saddle
on
the
charger
and
the
jewelled
bridle
and
he
neighed
with
pleasure
for
he
understood
being
a
horse
who
could
see
as
far
into
a
stone
wall
as
most
people
and
when
he
was
saddled
he
knelt
for
her
to
mount
and
then
up
and
away
like
the
wind
and
she
had
no
need
to
guide
him
with
the
reins
for
he
found
the
way
and
kept
it
he
galloped
steadily
on
and
the
sun
went
down
and
the
night
grew
dark
and
he
went
on
and
on
and
on
without
stumble
or
pause
till
at
moonrise
he
halted
before
the
house
of
the
great
white
rat
then
as
the
real
sprang
down
the
great
white
rat
came
out
from
his
house
and
spoke
you
ve
come
for
it
then
for
what
the
magic
cat
i
ve
guarded
it
some
thousands
of
years
i
knew
there
would
be
a
use
for
it
at
last
he
may
be
saved
yet
if
some
one
should
love
him
well
enough
to
die
for
i
do
that
said
the
little
and
took
the
cat
in
her
hands
swallow
it
said
the
white
rat
and
you
ll
turn
into
a
the
little
maid
swallowed
it
at
once
and
behold
she
was
a
little
mouse
what
am
i
to
do
she
asked
i
can
t
tell
you
said
the
great
white
rat
but
love
will
tell
so
the
little
in
the
form
of
the
mouse
ran
up
one
of
the
horse
s
legs
and
held
tight
on
to
the
saddle
with
all
her
little
claws
and
as
the
great
horse
galloped
back
towards
the
palace
in
the
moonlight
she
thought
and
thought
and
at
last
she
said
to
the
witch
is
in
cat
s
shape
and
she
must
have
cat
nature
so
she
will
run
after
a
mouse
she
will
run
after
and
if
i
can
lead
her
to
a
running
stream
she
will
leap
across
it
and
then
she
will
have
to
take
her
own
shape
again
that
must
be
what
the
great
white
rat
meant
me
to
do
and
if
the
cat
catches
at
least
if
i
can
t
save
my
prince
i
can
die
for
and
the
thought
warmed
her
heart
as
the
great
horse
thundered
on
through
the
when
at
last
creeping
softly
on
little
noiseless
feet
the
the
great
hall
she
saw
that
she
was
only
just
in
time
for
the
black
cat
was
purring
and
looking
back
at
the
prince
as
she
walked
waving
her
black
tail
towards
the
further
door
of
the
hall
and
the
prince
more
bewitched
than
ever
was
slowly
following
her
then
the
uttered
a
squeak
and
rushed
across
the
porphyry
floor
and
the
black
cat
true
to
its
cat
nature
left
purring
at
the
prince
and
sprang
after
the
mouse
and
the
mouse
at
its
best
speed
made
for
the
garden
where
ran
the
stream
that
fed
the
marble
basins
where
the
royal
lived
the
prince
understood
nothing
save
that
the
enchanting
black
furry
creature
was
leaving
him
and
in
an
instant
he
was
alone
he
followed
to
the
door
and
saw
the
cat
springing
along
the
passage
down
the
followed
along
another
passage
that
passed
the
foot
of
the
back
stairs
and
he
saw
that
the
back
stairs
were
like
a
was
running
down
in
a
torrent
and
meandering
away
down
the
brick
passage
and
out
into
the
faint
new
sunshine
when
the
mouse
saw
this
stream
she
thought
i
m
she
never
thought
of
wondering
how
a
stream
came
to
be
running
down
the
back
stairs
of
the
palace
when
she
came
to
think
of
it
afterwards
she
always
believed
that
the
great
white
rat
had
managed
it
somehow
she
never
knew
that
it
was
really
a
great
flood
from
the
royal
bathroom
where
the
royal
housemaid
in
her
eagerness
to
run
away
from
the
witch
had
left
all
the
royal
full
on
the
mouse
bounded
across
the
cat
saw
the
danger
but
she
could
not
stop
herself
she
too
crossed
the
stream
and
as
she
crossed
it
she
turned
into
the
wicked
fairy
and
snakes
and
newts
and
bat
and
all
the
prince
put
his
hand
to
his
head
like
one
awakening
from
sleep
and
the
horrible
fairy
vanished
suddenly
and
for
ever
then
the
mouse
ran
trembling
to
the
prince
and
in
its
thin
little
mouse
s
voice
told
him
all
my
love
and
my
lady
he
said
holding
the
mouse
against
his
cheek
i
will
marry
you
now
that
will
carry
out
the
wicked
fairy
s
prophecy
then
we
will
go
back
to
the
great
white
rat
and
you
shall
be
changed
into
a
so
the
prince
rang
the
church
bells
till
all
the
people
came
out
of
their
holes
where
they
had
been
hiding
to
see
the
strange
spectacle
of
a
prince
married
to
a
mouse
and
directly
they
were
married
they
set
off
on
the
black
charger
and
when
they
reached
the
great
white
rat
they
told
their
tale
and
now
said
the
prince
joyously
if
you
will
change
her
into
a
lady
again
we
will
go
home
at
once
and
begin
living
happily
ever
the
great
white
rat
looked
at
them
gravely
it
s
impossible
he
said
i
am
sorry
but
the
effects
of
the
magic
cat
are
once
a
mouse
always
a
mouse
if
you
get
moused
by
the
magic
cat
the
prince
and
the
mouse
looked
sadly
at
each
other
this
was
the
last
thing
they
had
expected
the
great
white
rat
looked
at
them
earnestly
then
he
if
it
would
be
of
any
use
to
you
i
ve
got
another
magic
cat
he
held
it
out
the
prince
took
it
gladly
kingdom
and
the
life
of
a
king
were
nothing
to
him
compared
with
the
love
and
happiness
of
a
disguised
as
a
mouse
he
put
the
stone
to
his
lips
you
know
what
ll
happen
if
you
do
said
the
great
white
rat
i
shall
change
into
a
mouse
and
live
happy
ever
after
said
the
prince
gaily
perhaps
said
the
great
white
rat
nothing
is
impossible
if
people
love
each
other
you
mustn
t
cried
the
mouse
trying
to
get
between
his
lips
and
the
cat
my
dear
little
real
said
the
prince
tenderly
you
have
saved
my
you
my
life
i
would
rather
be
a
mouse
with
you
than
a
king
without
you
and
with
that
he
swallowed
the
cat
and
two
small
mice
stood
side
by
side
before
the
great
white
rat
very
kindly
he
looked
at
them
then
he
pulled
a
hair
from
his
left
whisker
and
laid
it
across
their
little
brown
backs
and
on
the
instant
there
stood
up
a
prince
and
a
princess
and
at
their
feet
lay
the
little
empty
illustration
there
stood
up
a
prince
and
a
princess
it
s
lucky
for
you
said
the
great
white
rat
that
you
chose
to
swallow
the
cat
because
people
who
have
been
moused
by
that
means
can
never
be
except
nothing
is
impossible
if
people
only
love
each
other
so
the
prince
and
his
bride
returned
to
the
palace
and
lived
happy
ever
after
they
were
as
happy
as
if
they
had
been
in
a
country
where
there
are
no
cats
is
saying
a
good
deal
of
course
the
prince
is
still
afraid
of
cats
but
the
curious
thing
is
that
now
his
wife
is
afraid
of
them
too
perhaps
she
learnt
that
lesson
when
she
was
a
mouse
for
his
sake
he
when
he
was
a
mouse
for
hers
learned
this
lesson
which
is
also
the
moral
of
this
story
nothing
is
impossible
if
people
only
love
each
other
long
and
short
when
the
princess
melisande
was
born
her
mother
the
queen
wished
to
have
a
christening
party
but
the
king
put
his
foot
down
and
said
he
would
not
have
it
i
ve
seen
too
much
trouble
come
of
christening
parties
said
he
however
carefully
you
keep
your
some
fairy
or
other
is
sure
to
get
left
out
and
you
know
what
leads
to
why
even
in
my
own
family
the
most
shocking
things
have
occurred
the
fairy
malevola
was
not
asked
to
my
s
you
know
all
about
the
spindle
and
the
hundred
years
perhaps
you
re
right
said
the
queen
my
own
cousin
by
marriage
forgot
some
stuffy
old
fairy
or
other
when
she
was
sending
out
the
cards
for
her
daughter
s
christening
and
the
old
wretch
turned
up
at
the
last
moment
and
the
girl
drops
toads
out
of
her
mouth
to
this
just
so
and
then
there
was
that
business
of
the
mouse
and
the
said
the
king
we
ll
have
no
nonsense
about
it
i
ll
be
her
godfather
and
you
shall
be
her
godmother
and
we
won
t
ask
a
single
fairy
then
none
of
them
can
be
unless
they
all
are
said
the
queen
and
that
was
exactly
what
happened
when
the
king
and
the
queen
and
the
baby
got
back
from
the
christening
the
parlourmaid
met
them
at
the
door
and
please
your
majesty
several
ladies
have
called
i
told
them
you
were
not
at
home
but
they
all
said
they
d
are
they
in
the
parlour
asked
the
queen
i
ve
shown
them
into
the
throne
room
your
majesty
said
the
parlourmaid
you
see
there
are
several
of
there
were
about
seven
hundred
the
great
throne
room
was
crammed
with
fairies
of
all
ages
and
of
all
degrees
of
beauty
and
fairies
and
bad
fairies
flower
fairies
and
moon
fairies
fairies
like
spiders
and
fairies
like
as
the
queen
opened
the
door
and
began
to
say
how
sorry
she
was
to
have
kept
them
waiting
they
all
cried
with
one
voice
why
didn
t
you
ask
to
your
christening
party
i
haven
t
had
a
party
said
the
queen
and
she
turned
to
the
king
and
whispered
i
told
you
this
was
her
only
consolation
you
ve
had
a
christening
said
the
fairies
all
together
i
m
very
sorry
said
the
poor
queen
but
malevola
pushed
forward
and
said
hold
your
tongue
most
rudely
malevola
is
the
oldest
as
well
as
the
most
wicked
of
the
fairies
she
is
deservedly
unpopular
and
has
been
left
out
of
more
christening
parties
than
all
the
rest
of
the
fairies
put
together
don
t
begin
to
make
excuses
she
said
shaking
her
finger
at
the
queen
that
only
makes
your
conduct
worse
you
know
well
enough
what
happens
if
a
fairy
is
left
out
of
a
christening
party
we
are
all
going
to
give
our
christening
presents
as
the
fairy
of
highest
social
position
i
shall
begin
the
princess
shall
be
the
queen
nearly
fainted
as
malevola
drew
back
and
another
fairy
in
a
smart
bonnet
with
snakes
in
it
stepped
forward
with
a
rustle
of
bats
wings
but
the
king
stepped
forward
too
no
you
don
t
said
he
i
wonder
at
you
ladies
i
do
indeed
how
can
you
be
so
unfairylike
have
none
of
you
been
to
none
of
you
studied
the
history
of
your
own
race
surely
you
don
t
need
a
poor
ignorant
king
like
me
to
tell
you
that
this
is
how
dare
you
cried
the
fairy
in
the
bonnet
and
the
snakes
in
it
quivered
as
she
tossed
her
head
it
is
my
turn
and
i
say
the
princess
shall
the
king
actually
put
his
hand
over
her
mouth
look
here
he
said
i
won
t
have
it
listen
to
you
ll
be
sorry
afterwards
a
fairy
who
breaks
the
traditions
of
fairy
history
goes
know
she
the
flame
of
a
candle
and
all
tradition
shows
that
only
bad
fairy
is
ever
forgotten
at
a
christening
party
and
the
good
ones
are
always
invited
so
either
this
is
not
a
christening
party
or
else
you
were
all
invited
except
one
and
by
her
own
showing
that
was
malevola
it
nearly
always
is
do
i
make
myself
clear
several
of
the
fairies
who
had
been
led
away
by
malevola
s
influence
murmured
that
there
was
something
in
what
his
majesty
said
try
it
if
you
don
t
believe
me
said
the
king
give
your
nasty
gifts
to
my
innocent
as
sure
as
you
do
out
you
go
like
a
now
then
will
you
risk
it
no
one
answered
and
presently
several
fairies
came
up
to
the
queen
and
said
what
a
pleasant
party
it
had
been
but
they
really
must
be
going
this
example
decided
the
rest
one
by
one
all
the
fairies
said
goodbye
and
thanked
the
queen
for
the
delightful
afternoon
they
had
spent
with
her
it
s
been
quite
too
lovely
said
the
lady
with
the
ask
us
again
soon
dear
queen
i
shall
be
so
to
see
you
again
and
the
baby
and
off
she
went
with
the
quivering
more
than
ever
when
the
very
last
fairy
was
gone
the
queen
ran
to
look
at
the
tore
off
its
honiton
lace
cap
and
burst
into
tears
for
all
the
baby
s
downy
golden
hair
came
off
with
the
cap
and
the
princess
melisande
was
as
bald
as
an
egg
don
t
cry
my
love
said
the
king
i
have
a
wish
lying
by
which
i
ve
never
had
occasion
to
use
my
fairy
godmother
gave
it
me
for
a
wedding
present
but
since
then
i
ve
had
nothing
to
wish
for
thank
you
dear
said
the
queen
smiling
through
her
tears
i
ll
keep
the
wish
till
baby
grows
up
the
king
went
on
and
then
i
ll
give
it
to
her
and
if
she
likes
to
wish
for
hair
she
oh
won
t
you
wish
for
it
said
the
queen
dropping
mixed
tears
and
kisses
on
the
baby
s
round
smooth
head
no
dearest
she
may
want
something
else
more
when
she
grows
up
and
besides
her
hair
may
grow
by
but
it
never
did
princess
melisande
grew
up
as
beautiful
as
the
sun
and
as
good
as
gold
but
never
a
hair
grew
on
that
little
head
of
hers
the
queen
sewed
her
little
caps
of
green
silk
and
the
princess
s
pink
and
white
face
looked
out
of
these
like
a
flower
peeping
out
of
its
bud
and
every
day
as
she
grew
older
she
grew
dearer
and
as
she
grew
dearer
she
grew
better
and
as
she
grew
more
good
she
grew
more
beautiful
now
when
she
was
grown
up
the
queen
said
to
the
my
love
our
dear
daughter
is
old
enough
to
know
what
she
wants
let
her
have
the
so
the
king
wrote
to
his
fairy
godmother
and
sent
the
letter
by
a
butterfly
he
asked
if
he
might
hand
on
to
his
daughter
the
wish
the
fairy
had
given
him
for
a
wedding
present
i
have
never
had
occasion
to
use
it
said
he
though
it
has
always
made
me
happy
to
remember
that
i
had
such
a
thing
in
the
house
the
wish
is
as
good
as
new
and
my
daughter
is
now
of
an
age
to
appreciate
so
valuable
a
to
which
the
fairy
replied
by
return
of
butterfly
dear
king
do
whatever
you
like
with
my
poor
little
present
i
had
quite
forgotten
it
but
i
am
pleased
to
think
that
you
have
treasured
my
humble
keepsake
all
these
years
your
affectionate
godmother
fortuna
so
the
king
unlocked
his
gold
safe
with
the
seven
keys
that
hung
at
his
girdle
and
took
out
the
wish
and
gave
it
to
his
daughter
and
melisande
said
father
i
will
wish
that
all
your
subjects
should
be
quite
but
they
were
that
already
because
the
king
and
queen
were
so
good
so
the
wish
did
not
go
off
so
then
she
said
then
i
wish
them
all
to
be
but
they
were
that
already
because
they
were
happy
so
again
the
wish
hung
fire
then
the
queen
said
dearest
for
my
sake
wish
what
i
tell
why
of
course
i
will
said
melisande
the
queen
whispered
in
her
ear
and
melisande
nodded
then
she
said
i
wish
i
had
golden
hair
a
yard
long
and
that
it
would
grow
an
inch
every
day
and
grow
twice
as
fast
every
time
it
was
cut
stop
cried
the
king
and
the
wish
went
off
and
the
next
moment
the
princess
stood
smiling
at
him
through
a
shower
of
golden
hair
oh
how
lovely
said
the
queen
what
a
pity
you
interrupted
her
dear
she
hadn
t
what
was
the
end
asked
the
king
oh
said
melisande
i
was
only
going
to
say
and
twice
as
it
s
a
very
good
thing
you
didn
t
said
the
king
you
ve
done
about
for
he
had
a
mathematical
mind
and
could
do
the
sums
about
the
grains
of
wheat
on
the
and
the
nails
in
the
horse
s
shoes
in
his
royal
head
without
any
trouble
at
all
why
what
s
the
matter
asked
the
queen
you
ll
know
soon
enough
said
the
king
come
let
s
be
happy
while
we
may
give
me
a
kiss
little
melisande
and
then
go
to
nurse
and
ask
her
to
teach
you
how
to
comb
your
i
know
said
melisande
i
ve
often
combed
mother
your
mother
has
beautiful
hair
said
the
king
but
i
fancy
you
will
find
your
own
less
easy
to
and
indeed
it
was
so
the
princess
s
hair
began
by
being
a
yard
long
and
it
grew
an
inch
every
night
if
you
know
anything
at
all
about
the
simplest
sums
you
will
see
that
in
about
five
weeks
her
hair
was
about
two
yards
long
this
is
a
very
inconvenient
length
it
trails
on
the
floor
and
sweeps
up
all
the
dust
and
though
in
palaces
of
course
it
is
all
still
it
is
not
nice
to
have
it
in
your
hair
and
the
princess
s
hair
was
growing
an
inch
every
night
when
it
was
three
yards
long
the
princess
could
not
bear
it
any
was
so
heavy
and
so
she
borrowed
nurse
s
scissors
and
cut
it
all
off
and
then
for
a
few
hours
she
was
comfortable
but
the
hair
went
on
growing
and
now
it
grew
twice
as
fast
as
before
so
that
in
days
it
was
as
long
as
ever
the
poor
princess
cried
with
tiredness
when
she
couldn
t
bear
it
any
more
she
cut
her
hair
and
was
comfortable
for
a
very
little
time
for
the
hair
now
grew
four
times
as
fast
as
at
first
and
in
eighteen
days
it
was
as
long
as
before
and
she
had
to
have
it
cut
then
it
grew
eight
inches
a
day
and
the
next
time
it
was
cut
it
grew
sixteen
inches
a
day
and
then
inches
and
inches
and
a
hundred
and
inches
a
day
and
so
on
growing
twice
as
fast
after
each
cutting
till
the
princess
would
go
to
bed
at
night
with
her
hair
clipped
short
and
wake
up
in
the
morning
with
yards
and
yards
and
yards
of
golden
hair
flowing
all
about
the
room
so
that
she
could
not
move
without
pulling
her
own
hair
and
nurse
had
to
come
and
cut
the
hair
off
before
she
could
get
out
of
bed
i
wish
i
was
bald
again
sighed
poor
melisande
looking
at
the
little
green
caps
she
used
to
wear
and
she
cried
herself
to
sleep
o
nights
between
the
golden
billows
of
the
golden
hair
but
she
never
let
her
mother
see
her
cry
because
it
was
the
queen
s
fault
and
melisande
did
not
want
to
seem
to
reproach
her
when
first
the
princess
s
hair
grew
her
mother
sent
locks
of
it
to
all
her
royal
relations
who
had
them
set
in
rings
and
brooches
later
the
queen
was
able
to
send
enough
for
bracelets
and
girdles
but
presently
so
much
hair
was
cut
off
that
they
had
to
burn
it
then
when
autumn
came
all
the
crops
failed
it
seemed
as
though
all
the
gold
of
harvest
had
gone
into
the
princess
s
hair
and
there
was
a
famine
then
melisande
it
seems
a
pity
to
waste
all
my
hair
it
does
grow
so
very
fast
couldn
t
we
stuff
things
with
it
or
something
and
sell
them
to
feed
the
people
so
the
king
called
a
council
of
merchants
and
they
sent
out
samples
of
the
princess
s
hair
and
soon
orders
came
pouring
in
and
the
princess
s
hair
became
the
staple
export
of
that
country
they
stuffed
pillows
with
it
and
they
stuffed
beds
with
it
they
made
ropes
of
it
for
sailors
to
use
and
curtains
for
hanging
in
kings
palaces
they
made
haircloth
of
it
for
hermits
and
other
people
who
wished
to
be
uncomfy
but
it
was
so
soft
and
silky
that
it
only
made
them
happy
and
warm
which
they
did
not
wish
to
be
so
the
hermits
gave
up
wearing
it
and
instead
mothers
bought
it
for
their
little
babies
and
all
infants
wore
little
shirts
of
and
still
the
hair
grew
and
grew
and
the
people
were
fed
and
the
famine
came
to
an
end
then
the
king
said
it
was
all
very
well
while
the
famine
now
i
shall
write
to
my
fairy
godmother
and
see
if
something
can
not
be
so
he
wrote
and
sent
the
letter
by
a
skylark
and
by
return
of
bird
came
this
why
not
advertise
for
a
competent
prince
offer
the
usual
so
the
king
sent
out
his
heralds
all
over
the
world
to
proclaim
that
any
respectable
prince
with
proper
references
should
marry
the
princess
melisande
if
he
could
stop
her
hair
growing
then
from
far
and
near
came
trains
of
princes
anxious
to
try
their
luck
and
they
brought
all
sorts
of
nasty
things
with
them
in
bottles
and
round
wooden
boxes
the
princess
tried
all
the
remedies
but
she
did
not
like
any
of
them
and
she
did
not
like
any
of
the
princes
so
in
her
heart
she
was
rather
glad
that
none
of
the
nasty
things
in
bottles
and
boxes
made
the
least
difference
to
her
hair
illustration
trains
of
princes
bringing
nasty
things
in
bottles
and
round
wooden
boxes
the
princess
had
to
sleep
in
the
great
throne
room
now
because
no
other
room
was
big
enough
to
hold
her
and
her
hair
when
she
woke
in
the
morning
the
long
high
room
would
be
quite
full
of
her
golden
hair
packed
tight
and
thick
like
wool
in
a
barn
and
every
night
when
she
had
had
the
hair
cut
close
to
her
head
she
would
sit
in
her
green
silk
gown
by
the
window
and
cry
and
kiss
the
little
green
caps
she
used
to
wear
and
wish
herself
bald
again
it
was
as
she
sat
crying
there
on
midsummer
eve
that
she
first
saw
prince
florizel
he
had
come
to
the
palace
that
evening
but
he
would
not
appear
in
her
presence
with
the
dust
of
travel
on
him
and
she
had
retired
with
her
hair
borne
by
twenty
pages
before
he
had
bathed
and
changed
his
garments
and
entered
the
now
he
was
walking
in
the
garden
in
the
moonlight
and
he
looked
up
and
she
looked
down
and
for
the
first
time
melisande
looking
on
a
prince
wished
that
he
might
have
the
power
to
stop
her
hair
from
growing
as
for
the
prince
he
wished
many
things
and
the
first
was
granted
him
for
he
you
are
melisande
and
you
are
florizel
there
are
many
roses
round
your
window
said
he
to
her
and
none
down
she
threw
him
one
of
three
white
roses
she
held
in
her
hand
then
he
white
rose
trees
are
strong
may
i
climb
up
to
you
surely
said
the
princess
so
he
climbed
up
to
the
window
now
said
he
if
i
can
do
what
your
father
asks
will
you
marry
me
my
father
has
promised
that
i
shall
said
melisande
playing
with
the
white
roses
in
her
hand
dear
princess
said
he
your
father
s
promise
is
nothing
to
me
i
want
yours
will
you
give
it
to
me
yes
said
she
and
gave
him
the
second
rose
i
want
your
yes
she
said
and
your
heart
with
yes
said
the
princess
and
she
gave
him
the
third
rose
and
a
kiss
to
seal
the
yes
said
she
and
a
kiss
to
go
with
the
yes
she
said
and
a
kiss
to
bring
the
yes
said
the
princess
and
she
gave
him
the
three
kisses
now
said
he
when
he
had
given
them
back
to
her
do
not
go
to
bed
stay
by
your
window
and
i
will
stay
down
here
in
the
garden
and
watch
and
when
your
hair
has
grown
to
the
filling
of
your
room
call
to
me
and
then
do
as
i
tell
i
will
said
the
princess
so
at
dewy
sunrise
the
prince
lying
on
the
turf
beside
the
heard
her
florizel
florizel
my
hair
has
grown
so
long
that
it
is
pushing
me
out
of
the
get
out
on
to
the
said
he
and
twist
your
hair
three
times
round
the
great
iron
hook
that
is
and
she
did
then
the
prince
climbed
up
the
rose
bush
with
his
naked
sword
in
his
teeth
and
he
took
the
princess
s
hair
in
his
hand
about
a
yard
from
her
head
and
jump
the
princess
jumped
and
screamed
for
there
she
was
hanging
from
the
hook
by
a
yard
and
a
half
of
her
bright
hair
the
prince
tightened
his
grasp
of
the
hair
and
drew
his
sword
across
it
then
he
let
her
down
gently
by
her
hair
till
her
feet
were
on
the
grass
and
jumped
down
after
her
they
stayed
talking
in
the
garden
till
all
the
shadows
had
crept
under
their
proper
trees
and
the
said
it
was
breakfast
time
then
they
went
in
to
breakfast
and
all
the
court
crowded
round
to
wonder
and
admire
for
the
princess
s
hair
had
not
grown
how
did
you
do
it
asked
the
king
shaking
florizel
warmly
by
the
hand
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world
said
florizel
modestly
you
have
always
cut
the
hair
off
the
princess
just
cut
the
princess
off
the
humph
said
the
king
who
had
a
logical
mind
and
during
breakfast
he
more
than
once
looked
anxiously
at
his
daughter
when
they
got
up
from
breakfast
the
princess
rose
with
the
rest
but
she
rose
and
rose
and
rose
till
it
seemed
as
though
there
would
never
be
an
end
of
it
the
princess
was
nine
feet
high
i
feared
as
much
said
the
king
sadly
i
wonder
what
will
be
the
rate
of
progression
you
see
he
said
to
poor
florizel
when
we
cut
the
hair
off
we
cut
the
princess
off
grows
i
wish
you
had
happened
to
think
of
that
the
princess
went
on
growing
by
she
was
so
large
that
she
had
to
have
her
dinner
brought
out
into
the
garden
because
she
was
too
large
to
get
indoors
but
she
was
too
unhappy
to
be
able
to
eat
anything
and
she
cried
so
much
that
there
was
quite
a
pool
in
the
garden
and
several
pages
were
nearly
drowned
so
she
remembered
her
alice
in
wonderland
and
stopped
crying
at
once
but
she
did
not
stop
growing
she
grew
bigger
and
bigger
and
bigger
till
she
had
to
go
outside
the
palace
gardens
and
sit
on
the
common
and
even
that
was
too
small
to
hold
her
comfortably
for
every
hour
she
grew
twice
as
much
as
she
had
done
the
hour
before
and
nobody
knew
what
to
do
nor
where
the
princess
was
to
sleep
fortunately
her
clothes
had
grown
with
her
or
she
would
have
been
very
cold
indeed
and
now
she
sat
on
the
common
in
her
green
gown
embroidered
with
gold
looking
like
a
great
hill
covered
with
gorse
in
flower
you
can
not
possibly
imagine
how
large
the
princess
was
growing
and
her
mother
stood
wringing
her
hands
on
the
castle
tower
and
the
prince
florizel
looked
on
to
see
his
princess
snatched
from
his
arms
and
turned
into
a
lady
as
big
as
a
mountain
the
king
did
not
weep
or
look
on
he
sat
down
at
once
and
wrote
to
his
fairy
godmother
asking
her
advice
he
sent
a
weasel
with
the
letter
and
by
return
of
weasel
he
got
his
own
letter
back
again
marked
gone
away
left
no
it
was
now
when
the
kingdom
was
plunged
into
gloom
that
a
neighbouring
king
took
it
into
his
head
to
send
an
invading
army
against
the
island
where
melisande
lived
they
came
in
ships
and
they
landed
in
great
numbers
and
melisande
looking
down
from
her
height
saw
alien
soldiers
marching
on
the
sacred
soil
of
her
country
i
don
t
mind
so
much
now
said
she
if
i
can
really
be
of
some
use
this
and
she
picked
up
the
army
of
the
enemy
in
handfuls
and
and
put
them
back
into
their
ships
and
gave
a
little
flip
to
each
transport
ship
with
her
finger
and
thumb
which
sent
the
ships
off
so
fast
that
they
never
stopped
till
they
reached
their
own
country
and
when
they
arrived
there
the
whole
army
to
a
man
said
it
would
rather
be
courtmartialled
a
hundred
times
over
than
go
near
the
place
again
illustration
the
princess
grew
so
big
that
she
had
to
go
and
sit
on
the
common
meantime
melisande
sitting
on
the
highest
hill
on
the
island
felt
the
land
trembling
and
shivering
under
her
giant
feet
i
do
believe
i
m
getting
too
heavy
she
said
and
jumped
off
the
island
into
the
sea
which
was
just
up
to
her
ankles
just
then
a
great
fleet
of
warships
and
gunboats
and
torpedo
boats
came
in
sight
on
their
way
to
attack
the
island
melisande
could
easily
have
sunk
them
all
with
one
kick
but
she
did
not
like
to
do
this
because
it
might
have
drowned
the
sailors
and
besides
it
might
have
swamped
the
island
so
she
simply
stooped
and
picked
the
island
as
you
would
pick
a
of
course
all
islands
are
supported
by
a
stalk
carried
it
away
to
another
part
of
the
world
so
that
when
the
warships
got
to
where
the
island
was
marked
on
the
map
they
found
nothing
but
sea
and
a
very
rough
sea
it
was
because
the
princess
had
churned
it
all
up
with
her
ankles
as
she
walked
away
through
it
with
the
island
when
melisande
reached
a
suitable
place
very
sunny
and
warm
and
with
no
sharks
in
the
water
she
set
down
the
island
and
the
people
made
it
fast
with
anchors
and
then
every
one
went
to
bed
thanking
the
kind
fate
which
had
sent
them
so
great
a
princess
to
help
them
in
their
need
and
calling
her
the
saviour
of
her
country
and
the
bulwark
of
the
nation
but
it
is
poor
work
being
the
nation
s
bulwark
and
your
country
s
saviour
when
you
are
miles
high
and
have
no
one
to
talk
to
and
when
all
you
want
is
to
be
your
humble
right
size
again
and
to
marry
your
sweetheart
and
when
it
was
dark
the
princess
came
close
to
the
island
and
looked
down
from
far
up
at
her
palace
and
her
tower
and
cried
and
cried
and
cried
it
does
not
matter
how
much
you
cry
into
the
sea
it
hardly
makes
any
difference
however
large
you
may
be
then
when
everything
was
quite
dark
the
princess
looked
up
at
the
stars
i
wonder
how
soon
i
shall
be
big
enough
to
knock
my
head
against
them
said
she
and
as
she
stood
she
heard
a
whisper
right
in
her
ear
a
very
little
whisper
but
quite
plain
cut
off
your
hair
it
said
now
everything
the
princess
was
wearing
had
grown
big
along
with
her
so
that
now
there
dangled
from
her
golden
girdle
a
pair
of
scissors
as
big
as
the
malay
peninsula
together
with
a
the
size
of
the
isle
of
wight
and
a
yard
measure
that
would
have
gone
round
australia
and
when
she
heard
the
little
little
voice
she
knew
it
small
as
it
was
for
the
dear
voice
of
prince
florizel
and
she
whipped
out
the
scissors
from
her
gold
case
and
snip
snip
snipped
all
her
hair
off
and
it
fell
into
the
sea
the
coral
insects
got
hold
of
it
at
once
and
set
to
work
on
it
and
now
they
have
made
it
into
the
biggest
coral
reef
in
the
world
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
story
then
the
voice
said
get
close
to
the
island
and
the
princess
did
but
she
could
not
get
very
close
because
she
was
so
large
and
she
looked
up
again
at
the
stars
and
they
seemed
to
be
much
farther
off
then
the
voice
said
be
ready
to
swim
and
she
felt
something
climb
out
of
her
ear
and
clamber
down
her
arm
the
stars
got
farther
and
farther
away
and
next
moment
the
princess
found
herself
swimming
in
the
sea
and
prince
florizel
swimming
beside
her
i
crept
on
to
your
hand
when
you
were
carrying
the
island
he
explained
when
their
feet
touched
the
sand
and
they
walked
in
through
the
shallow
water
and
i
got
into
your
ear
with
an
you
never
noticed
me
because
you
were
so
great
oh
my
dear
prince
cried
melisande
falling
into
his
arms
you
have
saved
me
i
am
my
proper
size
so
they
went
home
and
told
the
king
and
queen
both
were
very
very
happy
but
the
king
rubbed
his
chin
with
his
hand
and
you
ve
certainly
had
some
fun
for
your
money
young
man
but
don
t
you
see
that
we
re
just
where
we
were
before
why
the
child
s
hair
is
growing
and
indeed
it
was
then
once
more
the
king
sent
a
letter
to
his
godmother
he
sent
it
by
a
and
by
return
of
fish
come
the
just
back
from
my
holidays
sorry
for
your
troubles
why
not
try
scales
and
on
this
message
the
whole
court
pondered
for
weeks
but
the
prince
caused
a
pair
of
gold
scales
to
be
made
and
hung
them
up
in
the
palace
gardens
under
a
big
oak
tree
and
one
morning
he
said
to
the
my
darling
melisande
i
must
really
speak
seriously
to
you
we
are
getting
on
in
life
i
am
nearly
twenty
it
is
time
that
we
thought
of
being
settled
will
you
trust
me
entirely
and
get
into
one
of
those
gold
scales
so
he
took
her
down
into
the
garden
and
helped
her
into
the
scale
and
she
curled
up
in
it
in
her
green
and
gold
gown
like
a
little
grass
mound
with
buttercups
on
it
and
what
is
going
into
the
other
scale
asked
melisande
your
hair
said
florizel
you
see
when
your
hair
is
cut
off
you
it
grows
and
when
you
are
cut
off
your
hair
you
my
heart
s
delight
i
can
never
forget
how
you
grew
never
but
if
when
your
hair
is
no
more
than
you
and
you
are
no
more
than
your
hair
i
snip
the
scissors
between
you
and
it
then
neither
you
nor
your
hair
can
possibly
decide
which
ought
to
go
on
suppose
did
said
the
poor
princess
humbly
impossible
said
the
prince
with
a
shudder
there
are
limits
even
to
malevola
s
malevolence
and
besides
fortuna
said
will
you
try
it
i
will
do
whatever
you
wish
said
the
poor
princess
but
let
me
kiss
my
father
and
mother
once
and
nurse
and
you
too
my
dear
in
case
i
grow
large
again
and
can
kiss
nobody
any
so
they
came
one
by
one
and
kissed
the
princess
then
the
nurse
cut
off
the
princess
s
hair
and
at
once
it
began
to
grow
at
a
frightful
rate
the
king
and
queen
and
nurse
busily
packed
it
as
it
grew
into
the
other
scale
and
gradually
the
scale
went
down
a
little
the
prince
stood
waiting
between
the
scales
with
his
drawn
sword
and
just
before
the
two
were
equal
he
struck
but
during
the
time
his
sword
took
to
flash
through
the
air
the
princess
s
hair
grew
a
yard
or
two
so
that
at
the
instant
when
he
struck
the
balance
was
true
you
are
a
young
man
of
sound
judgment
said
the
king
embracing
him
while
the
queen
and
the
nurse
ran
to
help
the
princess
out
of
the
gold
scale
the
scale
full
of
golden
hair
bumped
down
on
to
the
ground
as
the
princess
stepped
out
of
the
other
one
and
stood
there
before
those
who
loved
her
laughing
and
crying
with
happiness
because
she
remained
her
proper
size
and
her
hair
was
not
growing
any
more
illustration
the
princess
in
one
scale
and
her
hair
in
the
other
she
kissed
her
prince
a
hundred
times
and
the
very
next
day
they
were
married
every
one
remarked
on
the
beauty
of
the
bride
and
it
was
noticed
that
her
hair
was
quite
five
feet
five
and
a
quarter
inches
down
to
her
pretty
ankles
because
the
scales
had
been
ten
feet
ten
and
a
half
inches
apart
and
the
prince
having
a
straight
eye
had
cut
the
golden
hair
exactly
in
the
middle
rex
there
was
once
a
lady
who
found
herself
in
middle
life
with
but
a
slight
income
knowing
herself
to
be
insufficiently
educated
to
be
able
to
practise
any
other
trade
or
calling
she
of
course
decided
without
hesitation
to
enter
the
profession
of
teaching
she
opened
a
very
select
boarding
school
for
young
ladies
the
highest
references
were
given
and
required
and
in
order
to
keep
her
school
as
select
as
possible
miss
fitzroy
robinson
had
a
brass
plate
fastened
on
to
the
door
with
an
inscription
in
small
polite
lettering
you
have
of
course
heard
of
the
polite
well
it
was
with
these
that
miss
fitzroy
robinson
s
was
engraved
select
boarding
establishment
for
the
daughters
of
respectable
a
great
many
kings
who
were
not
at
all
respectable
would
have
given
their
royal
ears
to
be
allowed
to
send
their
daughters
to
this
school
but
miss
fitzroy
robinson
was
very
firm
about
references
and
the
consequence
was
that
all
the
really
kings
were
only
too
pleased
to
be
permitted
to
pay
ten
thousand
pounds
a
year
for
their
daughters
education
and
so
miss
fitzroy
robinson
was
able
to
lay
aside
a
few
pounds
as
a
provision
for
her
old
age
and
all
the
money
she
saved
was
invested
in
land
only
one
monarch
refused
to
send
his
daughter
to
miss
fitzroy
robinson
on
the
ground
that
so
cheap
a
school
could
not
be
a
really
select
one
and
it
was
found
out
afterwards
that
his
references
were
not
at
all
satisfactory
there
were
only
six
boarders
and
of
course
the
best
masters
were
engaged
to
teach
the
royal
pupils
everything
which
their
parents
wished
them
to
learn
and
as
the
girls
were
never
asked
to
do
lessons
except
when
they
felt
quite
inclined
they
all
said
it
was
the
nicest
school
in
the
world
and
cried
at
the
very
thought
of
being
taken
away
thus
it
happened
that
the
six
pupils
were
quite
grown
up
and
were
just
becoming
parlour
boarders
when
events
began
to
occur
princess
daisy
the
daughter
of
king
fortunatus
the
ruling
sovereign
was
the
only
little
girl
in
the
school
now
it
was
when
she
had
been
at
school
about
a
year
that
a
ring
came
at
the
front
and
the
came
to
the
schoolroom
with
a
visiting
card
held
in
the
corner
of
her
her
hands
were
wet
because
it
was
a
gentleman
to
see
you
miss
she
said
and
miss
fitzroy
robinson
was
quite
fluttered
because
she
thought
it
might
be
a
respectable
monarch
with
a
daughter
who
wanted
teaching
but
when
she
looked
at
the
card
she
left
off
fluttering
and
said
dear
me
under
her
breath
because
she
was
very
genteel
if
she
had
been
vulgar
like
some
of
us
she
would
have
said
bother
and
if
she
had
been
more
vulgar
than
i
hope
any
of
us
are
she
might
have
said
drat
the
man
the
card
was
large
and
shiny
and
had
gold
letters
on
it
miss
fitzroy
robinson
read
chevalier
doloro
de
lara
professor
of
magic
white
and
the
black
art
pupils
instructed
at
their
own
residences
no
extras
special
terms
for
schools
evening
parties
attended
miss
fitzroy
robinson
laid
down
her
never
taught
without
a
her
yellow
cap
and
her
grey
curls
and
went
into
the
front
parlour
to
see
her
visitor
he
bowed
low
at
sight
of
her
he
was
very
tall
and
with
black
eyes
and
an
indescribable
mouth
it
is
indeed
a
pleasure
said
he
smiling
so
as
to
show
every
one
of
his
very
polite
but
very
difficult
thing
to
it
is
indeed
a
pleasure
to
meet
once
more
my
old
the
pleasure
is
mutual
i
am
sure
said
miss
fitzroy
robinson
if
it
is
sometimes
impossible
to
be
polite
and
truthful
at
the
same
moment
that
is
not
my
fault
nor
miss
fitzroy
robinson
s
i
have
been
travelling
about
said
the
professor
still
smiling
immeasurably
increasing
my
stock
of
wisdom
ah
dear
live
and
learn
do
we
not
and
now
i
am
really
a
far
more
competent
teacher
than
when
i
had
the
honour
of
instructing
you
may
i
hope
for
an
engagement
as
professor
in
your
academy
i
have
not
yet
been
able
to
arrange
for
a
regular
course
of
magic
said
the
schoolmistress
it
is
a
subject
in
which
parents
especially
royal
ones
take
but
too
little
it
was
your
favourite
study
said
the
professor
no
doubt
some
but
i
want
an
engagement
said
he
looking
hungrier
than
ever
a
thousand
pounds
for
thirteen
dear
it
s
quite
impossible
said
she
and
she
spoke
firmly
for
she
knew
from
history
how
dangerous
it
is
for
a
magician
to
be
allowed
anywhere
near
a
princess
some
harm
almost
always
comes
of
it
oh
very
well
said
the
professor
you
see
my
pupils
are
all
princesses
she
went
on
they
don
t
require
the
use
of
magic
they
can
get
all
they
want
without
then
it
s
said
he
it
s
no
thank
you
kindly
said
she
then
before
she
could
stop
him
he
sprang
past
her
out
at
the
door
and
she
heard
his
boots
on
the
oilcloth
of
the
passage
she
flew
after
him
just
in
time
to
have
the
schoolroom
door
slammed
and
locked
in
her
face
well
i
never
said
miss
fitzroy
robinson
she
hastened
to
the
top
of
the
house
and
hurried
down
the
schoolroom
chimney
which
had
been
made
with
steps
in
case
of
fire
or
other
emergency
she
stepped
out
of
the
grate
on
to
the
schoolroom
hearthrug
just
one
second
too
late
the
seven
princesses
were
all
gone
and
the
professor
of
magic
stood
alone
among
the
desks
smiling
the
largest
smile
miss
fitzroy
robinson
had
seen
yet
oh
you
naughty
bad
wicked
man
you
said
she
shaking
the
school
ruler
at
him
the
next
day
was
saturday
and
the
king
of
the
country
called
as
usual
to
take
his
daughter
daisy
out
to
spend
her
half
holiday
the
servant
who
opened
the
door
had
a
coarse
apron
on
and
cinders
in
her
hair
and
the
king
thought
it
was
sackcloth
and
ashes
and
said
so
a
little
anxiously
but
the
girl
said
no
i
ve
only
been
of
the
kitchen
for
the
matter
of
you
d
best
see
missus
so
the
king
was
shown
into
the
best
parlour
where
the
tasteful
were
and
the
antimacassars
and
drawings
executed
by
the
pupils
and
the
wool
mats
which
miss
fitzroy
robinson
s
aunt
made
so
beautifully
a
delightful
parlour
full
of
the
traces
of
the
refining
touch
of
a
woman
s
hand
miss
fitzroy
robinson
came
in
slowly
and
sadly
her
gown
was
neatly
made
of
an
ingenious
trimming
of
small
cinders
sewn
on
gold
some
cinders
dangled
by
silken
threads
from
the
edge
of
her
lace
cap
the
king
saw
at
once
that
she
was
annoyed
about
something
i
hope
i
m
not
too
early
said
he
your
majesty
she
answered
not
at
all
you
are
always
punctual
as
stated
in
your
references
something
has
happened
i
will
not
aggravate
your
misfortunes
by
breaking
them
to
you
your
daughter
daisy
the
pride
and
treasure
of
our
little
circle
has
disappeared
her
six
royal
companions
are
with
her
for
the
present
all
are
safe
but
at
the
moment
i
am
unable
to
lay
my
hand
on
any
one
of
the
the
king
sat
down
heavily
on
part
of
the
handsome
walnut
and
rep
suite
ladies
and
gentlemen
s
couch
and
six
occasional
chairs
and
gasped
miserably
he
could
not
find
words
but
the
schoolmistress
had
written
down
what
she
was
going
to
say
on
a
slate
and
learned
it
off
by
heart
so
she
was
able
to
go
on
fluently
your
majesty
i
am
not
wholly
to
me
if
i
mean
hang
me
if
you
must
but
first
allow
me
to
have
the
honour
of
offering
to
you
one
or
two
explanatory
with
this
she
sat
down
and
told
him
the
whole
story
of
the
professor
s
visit
only
stopping
exactly
where
i
stopped
when
i
was
telling
it
to
you
just
now
the
king
listened
plucking
nervously
at
the
fringe
of
a
purple
and
crimson
antimacassar
i
never
satisfied
with
the
professor
s
methods
said
miss
fitzroy
robinson
sadly
and
i
always
had
my
doubts
as
to
his
moral
character
doubts
now
set
at
rest
for
ever
after
concluding
my
course
of
instruction
with
him
some
years
ago
i
took
a
series
of
lessons
from
a
far
more
efficient
master
and
thanks
to
those
lessons
which
were
i
may
mention
extremely
costly
i
was
mercifully
enabled
to
put
a
spoke
in
the
wheel
of
the
unprincipled
did
you
save
the
princesses
cried
the
king
no
but
i
can
if
your
majesty
and
the
other
parents
will
leave
the
matter
entirely
in
my
it
s
rather
a
serious
matter
said
the
king
my
poor
little
i
would
ask
you
said
the
schoolmistress
with
dignity
not
to
attach
too
much
importance
to
this
event
of
course
it
is
regrettable
but
unpleasant
accidents
occur
in
all
schools
and
the
consequences
of
them
can
usually
be
averted
by
the
exercise
of
tact
and
i
ought
to
hang
you
you
know
said
the
king
doubtfully
no
doubt
said
miss
fitzroy
robinson
and
if
you
do
you
ll
never
see
your
daisy
again
your
duty
as
a
your
duty
to
duties
are
very
painful
but
can
i
trust
you
i
may
remind
you
said
she
drawing
herself
up
so
that
the
cinders
rattled
again
that
we
exchanged
satisfactory
references
at
the
commencement
of
our
business
the
king
rose
well
miss
fitzroy
robinson
he
said
i
have
been
entirely
satisfied
with
daisy
s
progress
since
she
has
been
in
your
charge
and
i
feel
i
can
not
do
better
than
leave
this
matter
entirely
in
your
able
the
schoolmistress
made
him
a
curtsey
and
he
went
back
to
his
marble
palace
a
monarch
with
his
crown
all
on
one
side
and
his
poor
dear
nose
red
with
weeping
the
select
boarding
establishment
was
shut
up
time
went
on
and
no
news
came
of
the
lost
princesses
the
king
found
but
little
comfort
in
the
fact
that
his
other
child
prince
denis
was
still
spared
to
him
denis
was
all
very
well
and
a
nice
little
boy
in
his
way
but
a
boy
is
not
a
girl
the
queen
was
much
more
than
the
king
but
of
course
she
had
the
housekeeping
to
see
to
and
the
making
of
the
pickles
and
preserves
and
the
young
prince
s
stockings
to
knit
so
she
had
not
much
time
for
weeping
and
after
a
year
she
said
to
the
my
dear
you
ought
to
do
something
to
distract
your
mind
it
s
unkinglike
to
sit
and
cry
all
day
now
do
make
an
effort
do
something
useful
if
it
s
only
opening
a
bazaar
or
laying
a
foundation
i
am
frightened
of
bazaars
said
the
king
they
are
like
buzz
and
worry
but
foundation
and
after
that
he
began
to
sit
and
think
sometimes
without
crying
and
to
make
notes
on
the
backs
of
old
envelopes
so
the
queen
felt
that
she
had
not
spoken
quite
in
vain
a
month
later
the
suggestion
of
foundation
stones
bore
fruit
the
king
floated
a
company
and
fortunatus
rex
became
almost
at
once
the
largest
speculative
builders
in
the
world
perhaps
you
do
not
know
what
a
speculative
builder
is
i
ll
tell
you
what
the
king
and
his
did
and
then
you
will
know
they
bought
all
the
pretty
woods
and
fields
they
could
get
and
cut
them
up
into
squares
and
grubbed
up
the
trees
and
the
grass
and
put
streets
there
and
and
ugly
little
yellow
brick
houses
in
the
hopes
that
people
would
want
to
live
in
them
and
curiously
enough
people
did
so
the
king
and
his
made
quite
a
lot
of
money
it
is
curious
that
nearly
all
the
great
fortunes
are
made
by
turning
beautiful
things
into
ugly
ones
making
beauty
out
of
ugliness
is
very
work
the
ugly
little
streets
crawled
further
and
further
out
of
the
town
eating
up
the
green
country
like
greedy
yellow
caterpillars
but
at
the
foot
of
the
clover
hill
they
had
to
stop
for
the
owner
of
clover
hill
would
not
sell
any
land
at
any
price
that
fortunatus
rex
could
offer
in
vain
the
solicitors
of
the
company
called
on
the
solicitors
of
the
owner
wearing
their
best
cloaks
and
swords
and
shields
and
took
them
out
to
lunch
and
gave
them
nice
things
to
eat
and
drink
clover
hill
was
not
for
sale
at
last
however
a
little
old
woman
all
in
grey
called
at
the
company
s
shining
brass
and
mahogany
offices
and
had
a
private
interview
with
the
king
himself
i
am
the
owner
of
clover
hill
said
she
and
you
may
build
on
all
its
acres
except
the
seven
at
the
top
and
the
fifteen
acres
that
go
round
that
seven
and
you
must
build
me
a
high
wall
round
the
seven
acres
and
another
round
the
brick
mind
none
of
your
cheap
yellow
you
must
make
a
brand
new
law
that
any
one
who
steals
my
fruit
is
to
be
hanged
from
the
tree
he
stole
it
from
that
s
all
what
do
you
say
the
king
said
yes
because
since
his
trouble
he
cared
for
nothing
but
building
and
his
royal
soul
longed
to
see
the
green
clover
hill
eaten
up
by
yellow
brick
caterpillars
with
slate
tops
he
did
not
at
all
like
building
the
two
red
brick
walls
but
he
did
it
now
the
old
woman
wanted
the
walls
and
the
acres
to
be
this
sort
of
illustration
but
it
was
such
a
bother
getting
the
exact
amount
of
ground
into
the
two
circles
that
all
the
surveyors
tore
out
their
hair
by
handfuls
and
at
last
the
king
said
oh
bother
do
it
this
way
and
drew
a
plan
on
the
back
of
an
old
act
of
parliament
so
they
did
and
it
was
like
i
v
illustration
the
old
lady
was
very
vexed
when
she
found
that
there
was
only
one
wall
between
her
orchard
and
the
world
as
you
see
was
the
case
at
the
corner
where
the
two
s
and
the
meet
but
the
king
said
he
couldn
t
afford
to
build
it
all
over
again
and
that
she
d
got
her
two
walls
as
she
had
said
so
she
had
to
put
up
with
it
only
she
insisted
on
the
king
s
getting
her
a
fierce
to
fly
at
the
throat
of
any
one
who
should
come
over
the
wall
at
that
weak
point
where
the
two
s
join
on
to
the
so
he
got
her
a
stout
whose
name
was
martha
and
brought
it
himself
in
a
jewelled
leash
martha
will
fly
at
any
one
who
is
not
of
kingly
blood
said
he
of
course
she
wouldn
t
dream
of
biting
a
royal
person
but
then
on
the
other
hand
royal
people
don
t
rob
so
the
old
woman
had
to
be
contented
she
tied
martha
up
in
the
unprotected
corner
of
her
inner
enclosure
and
then
she
planted
little
baby
apple
trees
and
had
a
house
built
and
sat
down
in
it
and
waited
and
the
king
was
almost
happy
the
creepy
crawly
yellow
caterpillars
ate
up
clover
except
the
little
green
crown
on
the
top
where
the
apple
trees
were
and
the
two
red
brick
walls
and
the
little
house
and
the
old
woman
the
poor
queen
went
on
seeing
to
the
jam
and
the
pickles
and
the
blanket
washing
and
the
spring
cleaning
and
every
now
and
then
she
would
say
to
her
fortunatus
my
love
do
you
think
miss
fitzroy
robinson
is
trustworthy
shall
we
ever
see
our
daisy
again
and
the
king
would
rumple
his
fair
hair
with
his
hands
till
it
stuck
out
like
cheese
straws
under
his
crown
and
my
dear
you
must
be
patient
you
know
we
had
the
very
highest
now
one
day
the
new
yellow
brick
town
the
king
had
built
had
a
delightful
experience
six
handsome
princes
on
beautiful
white
horses
came
riding
through
the
dusty
little
streets
the
housings
of
their
chargers
shone
with
silver
embroidery
and
gleaming
glowing
jewels
and
their
gold
armour
flashed
so
gloriously
in
the
sun
that
all
the
little
children
clapped
their
hands
and
the
princes
faces
were
so
young
and
kind
and
handsome
that
all
the
old
women
said
bless
their
pretty
hearts
now
of
course
you
will
not
need
to
be
told
that
these
six
princes
were
looking
for
the
six
princesses
who
had
been
so
happy
at
the
select
boarding
establishment
their
six
royal
fathers
who
lived
many
years
journey
away
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
and
had
not
yet
heard
that
the
princesses
were
mislaid
had
given
miss
fitzroy
robinson
s
address
to
these
princes
and
instructed
them
to
marry
the
six
princesses
without
delay
and
bring
them
home
but
when
they
got
to
the
select
boarding
establishment
for
the
daughters
of
respectable
monarchs
the
house
was
closed
and
a
card
was
in
the
window
saying
that
this
desirable
villa
residence
was
to
be
let
on
moderate
terms
furnished
or
otherwise
the
wax
fruit
under
the
glass
shade
still
showed
attractively
through
the
dusty
panes
the
six
princes
looked
through
the
window
by
turns
they
were
charmed
with
the
furniture
and
the
refining
touch
of
a
woman
s
hand
drew
them
like
a
magnet
they
took
the
house
but
they
had
their
meals
at
the
palace
by
the
king
s
special
invitation
king
fortunatus
told
the
princes
the
dreadful
story
of
the
disappearance
of
the
entire
select
school
and
each
prince
swore
by
his
and
his
honour
that
he
would
find
out
the
particular
princess
that
he
was
to
marry
or
perish
in
the
attempt
for
of
course
each
prince
was
to
marry
one
princess
mentioned
by
name
in
his
instructions
and
not
one
of
the
others
the
first
night
that
the
princes
spent
in
the
furnished
house
passed
quietly
enough
so
did
the
second
and
the
third
and
the
fourth
fifth
and
sixth
but
on
the
seventh
night
as
the
princes
sat
playing
spilikins
in
the
schoolroom
they
suddenly
heard
a
voice
that
was
not
any
of
theirs
it
said
open
up
africa
the
princes
looked
here
there
and
they
could
see
no
one
they
had
not
been
brought
up
to
the
exploring
trade
and
could
not
have
opened
up
africa
if
they
had
wanted
to
or
cut
through
the
isthmus
of
panama
said
the
voice
again
now
as
it
happened
none
of
the
six
princes
were
engineers
they
confessed
as
much
cut
up
china
then
said
the
voice
desperately
it
s
like
the
ghost
of
a
tory
newspaper
said
one
of
the
princes
and
then
suddenly
they
knew
that
the
voice
came
from
one
of
the
pair
of
globes
which
hung
in
frames
at
the
end
of
the
schoolroom
it
was
the
terrestrial
globe
i
m
inside
said
the
voice
i
can
t
get
out
oh
cut
the
let
me
out
but
the
african
route
is
most
prince
primus
opened
up
africa
with
his
sword
and
out
tumbled
half
a
professor
of
magic
my
other
half
s
in
there
he
said
pointing
to
the
celestial
globe
let
my
legs
out
but
prince
secundus
said
not
so
fast
and
prince
tertius
said
why
were
you
shut
up
i
was
shut
up
for
as
pretty
a
bit
of
as
ever
you
saw
in
all
your
born
days
said
the
top
half
of
the
professor
of
magic
oh
you
were
were
you
said
prince
quartus
well
your
legs
aren
t
coming
out
just
yet
we
want
to
engage
a
competent
magician
you
ll
but
i
m
not
all
here
said
the
professor
quite
enough
of
you
said
prince
quintus
now
look
here
said
prince
sextus
we
want
to
find
our
six
princesses
we
can
give
a
very
good
guess
as
to
how
they
were
lost
but
we
ll
let
bygones
be
bygones
you
tell
us
how
to
find
them
and
after
our
weddings
we
ll
restore
your
legs
to
the
light
of
this
half
of
me
feels
so
faint
said
the
half
professor
of
magic
what
are
we
to
do
said
all
the
princes
threateningly
if
you
don
t
tell
us
you
shall
never
have
a
leg
to
stand
steal
apples
said
the
half
professor
hoarsely
and
fainted
away
they
left
him
lying
on
the
bare
boards
between
the
inkstained
desks
and
off
they
went
to
steal
apples
but
this
was
not
so
easy
because
fortunatus
rex
had
built
and
built
and
built
and
apples
do
not
grow
freely
in
those
parts
of
the
country
which
have
been
opened
up
by
speculative
builders
so
at
last
they
asked
the
little
prince
denis
where
he
went
for
apples
when
he
wanted
them
and
denis
the
old
woman
at
the
top
of
clover
hill
has
apples
in
her
seven
acres
and
in
her
fifteen
acres
but
there
s
a
fierce
bulldog
in
the
seven
acres
and
i
ve
stolen
all
the
apples
in
the
fifteen
acres
we
ll
try
the
seven
acres
said
the
princes
very
well
said
denis
you
ll
be
hanged
if
you
re
caught
so
as
i
put
you
up
to
it
i
m
coming
too
and
if
you
won
t
take
me
i
ll
tell
so
there
for
denis
was
a
most
honourable
little
prince
and
felt
that
you
must
not
send
others
into
danger
unless
you
go
yourself
and
he
would
never
have
stolen
apples
if
it
had
not
been
quite
as
dangerous
as
leading
armies
so
the
princes
had
to
agree
and
the
very
next
night
denis
let
himself
down
out
of
his
window
by
a
knotted
rope
made
of
all
the
stockings
his
mother
had
knitted
for
him
and
the
princes
were
waiting
under
the
window
and
off
they
all
went
to
the
orchard
on
the
top
of
clover
hill
they
climbed
the
wall
at
the
proper
corner
and
martha
the
bulldog
who
was
very
wellbred
and
knew
a
prince
when
she
saw
one
wagged
her
kinked
tail
respectfully
and
wished
them
good
luck
the
princes
stole
over
the
dewy
orchard
grass
and
looked
at
tree
after
tree
there
were
no
apples
on
any
of
them
only
at
last
in
the
very
middle
of
the
orchard
there
was
a
tree
with
a
copper
trunk
and
brass
branches
and
leaves
of
silver
and
on
it
hung
seven
beautiful
golden
apples
so
each
prince
took
one
of
the
golden
apples
very
quietly
and
off
they
went
anxious
to
get
back
to
the
of
magic
and
learn
what
to
do
next
no
one
had
any
doubt
as
to
the
having
told
the
truth
for
when
your
legs
depend
on
your
speaking
the
truth
you
will
not
willingly
tell
a
falsehood
they
stole
away
as
quietly
as
they
could
each
with
a
gold
apple
in
his
hand
but
as
they
went
prince
denis
could
not
resist
his
longing
to
take
a
bite
out
of
his
apple
he
opened
his
mouth
very
wide
so
as
to
get
a
good
bite
and
the
next
moment
he
howled
aloud
for
the
apple
was
as
hard
as
stone
and
the
poor
little
boy
had
broken
nearly
all
his
first
teeth
he
flung
the
apple
away
in
a
rage
and
the
next
moment
the
old
woman
rushed
out
of
her
house
she
screamed
martha
barked
prince
denis
howled
the
whole
town
was
aroused
and
the
six
princes
were
arrested
and
taken
under
a
strong
guard
to
the
tower
denis
was
let
off
on
the
ground
of
his
youth
and
besides
he
had
lost
most
of
his
teeth
which
is
a
severe
punishment
even
for
stealing
apples
the
king
sat
in
his
hall
of
justice
next
morning
and
the
old
woman
and
the
princes
came
before
him
when
the
story
had
been
told
he
my
dear
fellows
i
hope
you
ll
excuse
laws
of
hospitality
are
business
is
business
after
all
i
should
not
like
to
have
any
constitutional
unpleasantness
over
a
little
thing
like
this
you
must
all
be
hanged
the
princes
were
extremely
vexed
but
they
did
not
make
a
fuss
they
asked
to
see
denis
and
told
him
what
to
do
so
denis
went
to
the
furnished
house
which
had
once
been
a
select
boarding
establishment
for
the
daughters
of
respectable
monarchs
the
door
was
locked
but
denis
knew
a
way
in
because
his
sister
had
told
him
all
about
it
one
holiday
he
got
up
on
the
roof
and
walked
down
the
schoolroom
chimney
there
on
the
schoolroom
floor
lay
half
a
professor
of
magic
struggling
feebly
and
uttering
sad
faint
squeals
what
are
we
to
do
now
said
denis
steal
apples
said
the
in
a
weak
whisper
do
let
my
legs
out
slice
up
the
great
the
milky
way
would
be
a
good
one
for
them
to
come
out
but
denis
knew
better
not
till
we
get
the
lost
princesses
said
he
now
what
s
to
be
done
steal
apples
i
tell
you
said
the
crossly
seven
kisses
cut
them
down
oh
go
along
with
you
do
leave
me
to
die
you
heartless
boy
i
ve
got
pins
and
needles
in
my
then
off
ran
denis
to
the
seven
acre
orchard
at
the
top
of
clover
hill
and
there
were
the
six
princes
hanging
to
the
and
the
hangman
had
gone
home
to
his
dinner
and
there
was
no
one
else
about
and
the
princes
were
not
dead
denis
climbed
up
the
tree
and
cut
the
princes
down
with
the
penknife
of
the
gardener
s
boy
you
will
often
find
this
penknife
mentioned
in
your
german
exercises
now
you
know
why
so
much
fuss
is
made
about
it
the
princes
fell
to
the
ground
and
when
they
recovered
their
wits
denis
told
them
what
he
had
done
oh
why
did
you
cut
us
down
said
the
princes
we
were
having
such
happy
well
said
denis
shutting
up
the
penknife
of
the
gardener
s
boy
of
all
the
ungrateful
chaps
and
he
turned
his
back
and
marched
off
but
they
ran
quickly
after
him
and
thanked
him
and
told
him
how
they
had
been
dreaming
of
walking
arm
in
arm
with
the
most
dear
and
lovely
princesses
in
the
world
well
said
denis
it
s
no
use
dreaming
about
you
ve
got
your
own
registered
princesses
to
find
and
the
says
steal
there
aren
t
any
more
to
steal
said
the
when
they
looked
there
were
the
gold
apples
back
on
the
tree
just
as
before
so
once
again
they
each
picked
one
denis
chose
a
different
one
this
time
he
thought
it
might
be
softer
the
last
time
he
had
chosen
the
biggest
now
he
took
the
littlest
apple
of
all
seven
kisses
he
cried
and
began
to
kiss
the
little
gold
apple
each
prince
kissed
the
apple
he
held
till
the
sound
of
kisses
was
like
the
whisper
of
the
evening
wind
in
leafy
trees
and
of
course
at
the
seventh
kiss
each
prince
found
that
he
had
in
his
hand
not
an
apple
but
the
fingers
of
a
lovely
princess
as
for
denis
he
had
got
his
little
sister
daisy
and
he
was
so
glad
he
promised
at
once
to
give
her
his
and
his
whole
collection
of
foreign
postage
stamps
what
is
your
name
dear
and
lovely
lady
asked
prince
primus
sexta
said
his
princess
and
then
it
turned
out
that
every
single
one
of
the
princes
had
picked
the
wrong
apple
so
that
each
one
had
a
princess
who
was
not
the
one
mentioned
in
his
letter
of
instructions
secundus
had
plucked
the
apple
that
held
quinta
and
tertius
held
quarta
and
so
everything
was
as
as
it
possibly
could
be
and
yet
nobody
wanted
to
change
then
the
old
woman
came
out
of
her
house
and
looked
at
them
and
chuckled
and
she
you
must
be
contented
with
what
you
we
said
all
twelve
of
them
but
what
about
our
parents
they
must
put
up
with
your
choice
said
the
old
woman
it
s
the
common
lot
of
i
think
you
ought
to
sort
yourselves
out
properly
said
denis
i
m
the
only
one
who
s
got
his
right
i
wasn
t
greedy
i
took
the
the
tallest
princess
showed
him
a
red
mark
on
her
arm
where
his
little
teeth
had
been
two
nights
before
and
everybody
laughed
but
the
old
woman
they
can
t
change
my
dear
when
a
prince
has
picked
a
gold
apple
that
has
a
princess
in
it
and
has
kissed
it
till
she
comes
out
no
other
princess
will
ever
do
for
him
any
more
than
any
other
prince
will
ever
do
for
while
she
was
speaking
the
old
woman
got
younger
and
younger
and
younger
till
as
she
spoke
the
last
words
she
was
quite
young
not
more
than
and
it
was
miss
fitzroy
robinson
her
pupils
stepped
forward
one
by
one
with
respectful
curtsies
and
she
allowed
them
to
kiss
her
on
the
cheek
just
as
if
it
was
day
then
all
together
and
very
happily
they
went
down
to
the
furnished
villa
that
had
once
been
the
select
school
and
when
the
had
promised
on
his
honour
as
a
magician
to
give
up
magic
and
take
to
a
respectable
trade
they
took
his
legs
out
of
the
starry
sphere
and
gave
them
back
to
him
and
he
joined
himself
together
and
went
off
full
of
earnest
resolve
to
live
and
die
an
honest
plumber
my
talents
won
t
be
quite
wasted
said
he
a
little
is
useful
in
most
when
the
king
asked
miss
fitzroy
robinson
to
name
her
own
reward
for
restoring
the
princesses
she
make
the
land
green
again
your
so
fortunatus
rex
devoted
themselves
to
pulling
down
and
carting
off
the
yellow
streets
they
had
built
and
now
the
country
there
is
almost
as
green
and
pretty
as
it
was
before
princess
daisy
and
the
six
were
turned
into
gold
apples
it
was
very
clever
of
dear
miss
fitzroy
robinson
to
shut
up
that
professor
in
those
two
globes
said
the
queen
it
shows
the
advantage
of
having
lessons
from
the
best
yes
said
the
king
i
always
say
that
you
can
not
go
far
wrong
if
you
insist
on
the
highest
references
sums
that
came
if
barrelsful
of
apples
cost
what
would
the
same
barrels
be
worth
if
they
had
been
packed
by
a
dishonest
person
who
only
put
in
of
apples
in
each
barrel
and
the
rest
sawdust
this
was
the
sum
it
does
not
look
very
hard
perhaps
to
you
who
have
studied
ardently
for
years
at
a
board
school
or
a
high
school
or
a
preparatory
school
for
the
sons
of
gentlemen
but
to
edwin
it
looked
as
hard
as
a
ship
s
biscuit
but
he
went
for
it
like
a
man
and
presently
produced
an
answer
and
his
master
wrote
a
big
curly
r
across
the
sum
perhaps
you
do
not
know
that
a
big
curly
r
means
right
as
for
the
answer
to
the
sum
i
will
try
to
get
a
fellow
of
trinity
college
cambridge
who
is
a
very
terrible
person
to
work
it
out
for
you
and
if
he
can
do
it
i
will
put
the
answer
at
the
end
of
this
story
i
can
not
work
it
myself
edwin
was
glad
to
see
the
large
curly
he
saw
it
so
seldom
that
to
meet
it
was
a
real
pleasure
but
what
s
the
use
he
said
everything
else
leads
to
something
else
except
lessons
if
you
put
seeds
in
the
garden
they
come
up
flowers
unless
they
re
rotten
seeds
or
you
forget
where
you
put
them
and
if
you
buy
a
there
it
is
unless
it
dies
and
if
you
eat
your
you
re
not
hungry
any
more
for
an
hour
or
two
but
lessons
he
bit
his
penholder
angrily
and
put
his
head
into
his
desk
to
look
for
nibs
to
play
simpkins
minor
with
you
know
the
game
of
nibs
of
course
he
held
up
the
lid
of
the
desk
on
his
head
as
i
daresay
you
have
often
done
and
the
inside
of
the
desk
was
darkish
so
that
the
sudden
light
at
the
very
back
of
the
desk
showed
quite
brightly
and
unmistakably
those
firework
fusees
o
crikey
was
edwin
s
first
thought
but
it
was
no
firework
fusee
it
was
like
only
a
thousand
times
more
bright
and
white
for
it
was
the
light
of
pure
reason
and
it
glowed
from
the
glorious
eyes
of
the
arithmetic
fairy
you
did
not
know
that
there
was
an
arithmetic
fairy
if
you
knew
as
much
as
i
do
it
would
be
simply
silly
for
me
to
try
to
tell
you
stories
wouldn
t
it
her
wonderful
eyes
gleamed
and
flashed
straight
into
the
round
goggling
eyes
of
the
amazed
edwin
upon
my
word
she
said
edwin
said
nothing
did
no
one
ever
tell
you
the
fairy
went
on
shaking
out
her
dress
which
was
woven
of
the
integral
calculus
and
trimmed
with
a
dazzling
fringe
of
logarithms
did
no
one
ever
tell
you
that
the
things
that
happen
when
you
ve
done
your
sums
right
happen
when
you
re
grown
up
i
don
t
care
what
happens
then
edwin
dared
to
say
for
the
flashing
eyes
were
kind
eyes
i
shall
be
a
pirate
or
a
bushranger
or
the
fairy
drew
herself
up
and
her
graceful
garland
of
simple
equations
trembled
as
edwin
breathed
heavily
a
pirate
said
she
a
nice
sort
of
pirate
who
can
t
calculate
his
men
s
share
of
the
plunder
to
of
a
gold
link
of
the
dead
captain
s
chain
a
fine
bushranger
who
can
t
arrange
the
bullets
from
the
revolvers
of
his
seven
dauntless
followers
so
that
each
of
the
fifteen
enemies
gets
his
fair
share
go
along
with
you
said
the
arithmetic
fairy
but
edwin
s
eyes
were
as
i
said
wide
open
goggling
i
say
he
suddenly
remarked
how
jolly
pretty
you
the
arithmetic
fairy
has
but
one
feminine
weakness
she
loves
a
pretty
speech
if
blunt
so
much
the
worse
yet
even
bluntness
she
looked
down
and
played
shyly
with
the
bunch
of
miscellaneous
examples
in
vulgar
fractions
which
adorned
her
waistband
i
suppose
you
can
t
be
expected
to
understand
yet
she
said
and
she
said
it
very
gently
edwin
took
courage
when
i
do
things
i
want
something
to
happen
at
once
i
want
a
white
rabbit
and
i
want
it
she
did
not
recognise
the
quotation
get
your
master
to
set
you
a
little
simple
multiplication
sum
in
white
rabbits
she
said
goodbye
my
child
you
ll
know
me
better
in
time
and
as
you
know
me
better
you
ll
love
me
i
you
re
lovely
now
said
edwin
the
fairy
laughed
and
spread
her
dazzling
wings
glistening
with
all
the
glories
of
the
higher
mathematics
edwin
closed
dazzled
eyes
and
opened
them
as
the
desk
lid
shut
down
on
his
head
swayed
by
no
uncertain
hand
it
was
the
mathematical
master
s
hand
in
fact
a
new
example
was
set
and
curiously
enough
white
rabbits
were
in
it
if
seven
thousand
five
hundred
and
white
rabbits
it
began
edwin
his
brain
in
a
whirl
worked
it
correctly
by
a
sort
of
inspiration
like
an
ancient
prophet
or
a
calculating
machine
when
he
returned
with
his
books
in
a
strap
to
the
red
villa
whose
gables
meant
home
for
him
he
found
an
excited
crowd
dancing
round
the
gates
the
whole
of
the
front
garden
as
well
as
most
of
the
back
garden
was
a
seething
mass
of
white
rabbits
seven
thousand
five
hundred
and
there
were
to
be
exact
i
alone
know
this
the
joyous
edwin
and
his
distracted
parents
were
never
able
to
count
them
what
a
lot
of
hutches
we
shall
want
edwin
thought
gaily
but
when
his
father
came
home
from
the
stock
exchange
where
he
spent
his
days
in
considering
and
doubt
under
the
direct
guidance
of
the
arithmetic
fairy
he
said
at
send
for
the
this
was
done
only
one
pair
of
white
rabbits
remained
the
property
of
edwin
but
these
by
the
power
of
the
arithmetic
fairy
became
ten
by
christmas
the
rabbits
disposed
of
peace
spread
a
longing
wing
over
the
villa
but
was
not
allowed
to
settle
oh
please
m
the
startled
cook
cap
all
crooked
exclaimed
in
the
hall
the
cellar
is
of
of
em
bad
never
see
no
one
deliver
them
nor
yet
give
no
the
cook
for
once
in
a
lurid
career
spoke
truth
the
cellar
full
of
apples
nineteen
pounds
nineteen
and
twopence
and
of
a
be
accurate
edwin
went
to
bed
feeling
now
quite
sure
that
he
had
dreamed
the
arithmetic
fairy
and
anxiously
wondering
what
s
sums
would
be
about
not
he
trusted
about
snakes
or
sunday
school
teachers
the
next
day
s
sum
was
about
oranges
edwin
did
it
correctly
and
went
home
a
prey
to
the
most
golden
apprehensions
nor
were
these
unfounded
the
whole
of
the
and
most
of
the
to
the
seventh
step
of
the
neatly
carpeted
stairs
was
golden
with
oranges
edwin
s
father
said
some
severe
things
about
practical
jokers
and
sent
for
the
greengrocer
edwin
ate
nine
oranges
and
went
to
bed
yellow
but
not
absolutely
unhappy
but
now
he
was
quite
sure
on
the
following
day
his
sum
dealt
with
elephants
and
in
such
numbers
that
his
father
on
returning
from
business
yielded
to
a
very
natural
annoyance
and
gave
notice
to
his
landlord
that
he
should
at
lady
day
leave
a
villa
where
elephants
and
oranges
occurred
to
such
an
extent
no
one
suspected
edwin
of
having
anything
to
do
with
these
happenings
and
indeed
it
was
not
his
fault
so
how
and
why
could
or
should
he
have
owned
up
to
it
i
wish
i
had
time
to
tell
you
of
the
events
that
occurred
when
edwin
s
sums
were
set
in
buttered
muffins
of
the
pigs
travelling
in
a
circle
at
varying
rates
i
can
only
say
that
part
of
this
circle
ran
through
edwin
s
mother
s
nor
can
i
here
relate
the
tale
of
the
three
hundred
lightning
conductors
which
were
suddenly
found
to
be
attached
to
the
once
happy
edwin
s
mother
cried
all
day
when
she
was
not
laughing
and
people
came
from
far
and
near
to
see
the
haunted
house
for
when
it
came
to
four
thousand
white
owls
and
a
church
steeple
every
one
felt
that
it
was
more
than
a
mere
accident
edwin
s
master
had
a
pretty
taste
in
sums
and
about
once
a
term
he
used
to
set
a
sum
about
canes
edwin
worked
that
sum
wrong
on
purpose
so
i
suppose
it
served
him
right
that
the
canes
should
be
at
home
before
he
was
just
as
they
would
have
been
if
he
had
worked
the
sum
properly
and
as
he
had
borrowed
his
father
s
razor
that
morning
to
sharpen
a
the
canes
were
not
all
thrown
away
but
it
was
the
sum
about
the
cistern
that
convinced
edwin
of
the
desperate
need
of
finding
the
arithmetic
fairy
and
begging
her
to
take
back
the
present
she
had
made
him
it
is
not
polite
to
ask
this
but
edwin
had
to
do
it
you
see
in
the
sum
the
cistern
had
to
leak
three
pints
in
thirteen
minutes
and
a
quarter
but
the
cistern
at
home
happened
to
have
a
little
leak
of
its
own
already
where
edwin
had
tried
his
new
drill
on
it
and
the
two
leaks
together
managed
so
well
that
when
edwin
got
home
he
found
water
dripping
from
all
the
top
bedroom
ceilings
and
the
staircase
was
a
sort
of
niagara
it
was
very
when
the
plumber
came
he
let
edwin
s
father
know
all
about
the
little
drilled
hole
and
edwin
got
the
credit
of
the
leak
in
the
sum
which
was
much
larger
and
most
unfair
his
father
spoke
to
edwin
about
this
matter
in
his
study
and
it
was
then
that
edwin
saw
that
he
must
put
an
end
to
the
sums
that
came
true
so
he
went
up
to
his
bedroom
with
his
candle
and
his
arithmetic
book
directly
he
put
the
candle
on
the
chest
of
drawers
a
big
splash
of
water
from
the
ceiling
fell
right
on
the
flame
and
it
went
out
he
had
to
go
right
down
stairs
to
get
another
light
then
he
put
the
candle
on
the
dressing
it
went
chair
splash
out
at
last
he
got
the
candle
to
stay
alight
on
the
which
was
by
some
curious
accident
the
only
dry
place
in
the
room
then
he
opened
his
book
somewhere
in
the
book
he
knew
there
must
be
something
that
would
fetch
the
fairy
he
said
the
multiplication
table
up
to
nine
that
as
you
know
the
worst
is
over
but
no
fairy
appeared
then
he
read
aloud
the
instructions
for
working
the
different
rules
including
the
examples
given
there
was
no
result
then
he
called
to
the
she
did
not
come
then
he
tried
counting
then
counting
and
calling
mixed
with
other
things
like
this
oh
good
fairy
do
come
and
help
me
beautiful
dear
kind
lovely
fairy
nine
nines
are
dear
fairy
do
come
seven
million
two
hundred
thousand
six
hundred
and
i
will
always
love
you
if
you
will
come
to
me
now
of
of
of
you
were
so
kind
the
other
day
two
and
two
are
four
and
three
are
seven
do
come
ve
no
idea
what
an
awful
mess
you
ve
got
me
into
seven
nines
are
i
know
you
meant
it
kindly
dear
fairy
thirteen
from
leaves
do
come
and
see
what
a
hole
i
m
the
product
will
give
you
the
desired
result
edwin
stopped
out
of
breath
he
looked
round
him
for
the
fairy
but
his
room
with
the
water
dripping
from
the
roof
and
the
wet
towels
and
basins
on
the
floor
was
not
a
place
edwin
saw
with
a
sigh
that
it
was
no
go
i
ll
have
another
go
in
prep
he
said
this
he
did
the
mathematical
master
was
pleased
with
himself
that
day
because
he
had
succeeded
in
preventing
his
best
boy
from
yielding
to
the
allurements
of
the
and
the
classical
side
of
course
his
class
knew
at
once
what
kind
of
temper
the
mathematical
master
was
know
we
always
know
edwin
ventured
to
ask
that
the
examples
that
day
might
be
about
a
model
steam
engine
only
sir
please
he
was
careful
to
explain
the
master
kindly
consented
and
by
great
good
fortune
the
example
did
not
deal
with
a
faulty
boiler
nor
with
any
other
concerned
itself
solely
with
the
model
engine
s
speed
so
edwin
knew
when
he
had
worked
his
sum
exactly
what
pace
the
model
engine
he
would
find
at
home
would
be
good
for
he
worked
the
sum
right
then
he
put
his
head
into
his
desk
and
began
again
oh
good
fairy
if
a
sum
of
is
to
be
divided
between
a
b
and
c
do
come
and
help
me
of
a
pound
is
six
shillings
dear
lovely
and
so
on
but
no
fairy
came
and
simpkins
minor
what
are
you
chunnering
about
and
stuck
a
pin
into
edwin
s
leg
can
t
you
do
the
beastly
example
then
quite
suddenly
edwin
knew
what
he
had
to
do
he
made
up
an
example
for
himself
this
was
it
if
fairies
were
in
my
desk
at
school
and
i
subtracted
and
added
and
the
rest
flew
away
in
equal
gangs
how
many
would
be
left
over
in
the
desk
when
he
had
worked
it
the
answer
was
one
very
quickly
he
opened
his
desk
again
and
there
was
the
arithmetic
fairy
looking
more
lovely
than
ever
in
a
rich
gown
of
indices
lined
with
surds
that
fell
to
her
feet
in
osculating
curves
in
her
hand
like
a
sceptre
shone
the
starry
glory
of
the
binomial
theorem
but
her
eyes
were
starrier
still
she
smiled
but
her
first
words
were
severe
you
careless
boy
she
said
why
can
t
you
learn
to
be
accurate
it
s
the
merest
chance
you
got
me
you
should
have
stated
your
problem
more
clearly
and
you
should
have
said
seven
thousand
fairies
why
suppose
you
had
found
one
fairy
in
your
desk
and
it
had
been
the
grammar
fairy
or
the
football
would
you
have
done
then
there
a
football
fairy
edwin
asked
of
course
there
s
a
fairy
for
everything
you
have
to
learn
there
s
a
patience
fairy
and
a
fairy
and
a
fairy
to
teach
people
to
make
bread
and
another
to
teach
them
to
make
love
didn
t
you
really
know
that
no
said
edwin
but
i
say
look
i
am
looking
she
said
fixing
her
bright
eyes
on
edwin
s
goggling
ones
exactly
as
at
their
first
meeting
he
said
so
i
hear
she
said
no
kid
said
he
of
course
there
isn
t
any
kid
said
she
dear
kind
pretty
fairy
edwin
began
again
that
s
better
said
the
fairy
didn
t
you
hear
all
i
was
saying
to
you
yesterday
when
the
water
was
dripping
from
the
ceiling
all
over
the
room
from
nineteen
several
spots
of
course
i
well
then
said
edwin
you
mean
that
you
re
tired
of
having
things
happen
when
you
do
your
sums
correctly
you
prefer
the
old
way
yes
said
edwin
if
you
re
sure
you
don
t
mind
i
know
you
meant
it
for
kindness
but
oh
it
is
most
beastly
when
you
get
into
the
thick
of
he
was
thinking
of
the
elephants
i
fancy
i
only
did
it
to
please
you
said
the
fairy
pouting
i
ll
make
everything
as
it
was
before
does
please
you
and
there
s
your
third
wish
you
know
we
always
give
three
wishes
it
s
customary
in
the
profession
what
would
you
like
edwin
had
not
attended
properly
to
this
speech
so
he
had
only
heard
as
it
was
before
and
then
what
would
you
like
so
he
said
i
should
like
to
see
you
again
some
the
arithmetic
fairy
smiled
at
him
and
her
beauty
grew
more
and
more
radiant
she
had
not
expected
this
i
made
sure
you
would
ask
for
a
pony
or
a
cricket
bat
or
a
pair
of
white
mice
she
said
you
see
me
again
edwin
and
the
bright
vision
faded
away
in
a
dim
mist
of
rosy
permutations
when
edwin
got
home
he
heard
that
a
model
engine
had
been
discovered
in
the
larder
and
had
been
given
to
his
younger
brother
there
are
some
wrongs
some
sorrows
to
which
even
a
pen
like
mine
can
not
hope
to
do
justice
edwin
is
now
a
person
in
a
black
frock
coat
and
his
hair
is
slowly
withdrawing
itself
from
the
top
of
his
learned
head
i
suppose
it
feels
itself
unworthy
to
cover
so
great
a
brain
the
fairy
has
been
with
him
unseen
this
many
a
year
the
other
day
he
saw
her
he
had
been
senior
wrangler
of
course
that
was
nothing
to
edwin
and
he
was
astronomer
royal
but
that
after
all
he
had
a
right
to
expect
but
it
was
when
he
took
breath
from
his
researches
one
day
and
suddenly
found
that
he
had
invented
a
hypernebular
he
thought
of
the
fairy
and
thinking
of
her
he
beheld
her
she
was
lightly
poised
above
a
pile
of
books
based
on
newton
s
principia
and
topped
with
his
own
latest
work
the
fourth
and
further
he
knew
her
at
once
and
now
he
appreciated
more
than
ever
in
his
youth
the
radiance
of
her
eyes
and
of
her
wings
for
now
he
understood
it
dear
beautiful
fairy
he
said
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
i
ve
been
with
you
all
the
time
she
said
i
wish
i
could
do
something
more
for
you
is
there
anything
you
want
the
great
mathematician
who
was
edwin
ran
his
hand
over
his
thin
hair
no
he
said
and
then
he
remembered
the
school
and
simpkins
minor
and
the
old
desk
he
used
to
keep
firework
fusees
in
unless
he
added
you
could
make
me
young
she
dropped
a
little
tear
clear
as
a
solved
problem
i
can
t
do
she
said
you
can
t
have
the
only
person
who
could
do
that
for
you
is
the
love
fairy
if
you
had
found
her
instead
of
me
you
would
have
been
always
young
but
you
wouldn
t
have
invented
the
hypernebular
i
suppose
i
shall
never
never
find
her
now
said
edwin
and
as
he
spoke
he
looked
out
of
the
window
to
the
garden
where
a
girl
was
gathering
roses
i
wonder
said
she
the
love
fairy
doesn
t
live
in
schooldesks
or
books
on
fourth
i
wonder
said
edwin
does
the
love
fairy
live
in
gardens
i
wonder
echoed
the
arithmetic
fairy
a
little
sadly
and
she
spread
her
bright
wings
and
flew
out
of
the
open
window
and
out
of
this
story
edwin
went
out
into
the
rose
garden
and
did
he
find
the
love
fairy
i
wonder
fellow
of
trinity
says
the
answer
to
that
sum
is
nineteen
pounds
nineteen
shillings
and
two
pence
and
of
a
penny
does
the
fellow
of
trinity
speak
the
truth
i
wonder
town
in
the
library
in
the
town
in
the
rosamund
and
fabian
were
left
alone
in
the
library
you
may
not
believe
this
but
i
advise
you
to
believe
everything
i
tell
you
because
it
is
true
truth
is
stranger
than
and
when
you
grow
up
you
will
hear
people
say
this
till
you
grow
quite
sick
of
listening
to
them
you
will
then
want
to
write
the
strangest
story
that
ever
to
show
that
stories
can
be
stranger
than
truth
mother
was
obliged
to
leave
the
children
alone
because
nurse
was
ill
with
measles
which
seems
a
babyish
thing
for
a
nurse
to
it
is
quite
true
if
i
had
wanted
to
make
up
anything
i
could
have
said
she
was
ill
of
a
broken
heart
or
a
which
always
happens
in
books
but
i
wish
to
speak
the
truth
even
if
it
sounds
silly
and
it
measles
mother
could
not
stay
with
the
children
because
it
was
christmas
eve
and
on
that
day
a
lot
of
poor
old
people
came
up
to
get
their
christmas
presents
tea
and
snuff
and
flannel
petticoats
and
warm
capes
and
boxes
of
needles
and
cottons
and
things
like
that
generally
the
children
helped
to
give
out
the
presents
but
this
year
mother
was
afraid
they
might
be
going
to
have
measles
themselves
and
measles
is
a
nasty
forward
illness
with
no
manners
at
all
you
can
catch
it
from
a
person
before
they
know
they
ve
got
it
and
if
rosamund
and
fabian
had
been
going
to
have
it
they
might
have
given
it
to
all
the
old
men
and
women
who
came
up
to
get
their
christmas
presents
and
measles
is
a
present
no
old
men
or
women
want
to
have
given
them
even
at
christmas
time
no
matter
how
old
they
may
be
they
would
not
mind
or
a
broken
heart
so
much
it
is
more
interesting
but
no
one
can
think
it
interesting
to
have
measles
at
any
rate
till
you
come
to
the
part
where
they
give
you
jelly
and
boiled
sole
so
the
children
were
left
alone
before
mother
went
away
she
look
here
dears
you
may
play
with
your
bricks
or
make
pictures
with
your
pretty
blocks
that
kind
uncle
thomas
gave
you
but
you
must
not
touch
the
two
of
the
bureau
now
don
t
forget
and
if
you
re
good
you
shall
have
tea
with
me
and
perhaps
there
will
be
cake
now
you
be
good
won
t
you
fabian
and
rosamund
promised
faithfully
that
they
would
be
good
and
that
they
would
not
touch
the
two
and
mother
went
away
to
see
about
the
flannel
petticoats
and
the
tea
and
snuff
and
tobacco
and
things
when
the
children
were
left
alone
fabian
i
am
going
to
be
very
good
i
shall
be
much
more
good
than
mother
expects
me
we
look
in
the
drawers
said
rosamund
stroking
the
shiny
top
of
the
bureau
we
won
t
even
about
the
insides
of
the
drawers
said
fabian
he
stroked
the
bureau
too
and
his
fingers
left
four
long
streaks
on
it
because
he
had
been
eating
toffee
i
suppose
he
said
presently
we
may
open
the
two
drawers
mother
couldn
t
have
made
a
she
so
they
opened
the
two
bottom
drawers
just
to
be
sure
that
mother
hadn
t
made
a
mistake
and
to
see
whether
there
was
anything
in
the
bottom
drawers
that
they
ought
not
to
look
at
but
the
bottom
drawer
of
all
had
only
old
magazines
in
it
and
the
next
to
the
bottom
drawer
had
a
lot
of
papers
in
it
the
children
knew
at
once
by
the
look
of
the
papers
that
they
belonged
to
father
s
great
work
about
the
domestic
life
of
the
ancient
druids
and
they
knew
it
was
not
even
try
to
read
other
people
s
papers
so
they
shut
the
drawers
and
looked
at
each
other
and
fabian
said
i
think
it
would
be
right
to
play
with
the
bricks
and
the
pretty
blocks
that
uncle
thomas
gave
but
rosamund
was
younger
than
fabian
and
she
said
i
am
tired
of
the
blocks
and
i
am
tired
of
uncle
thomas
i
would
rather
look
in
the
so
would
i
said
fabian
and
they
stood
looking
at
the
bureau
perhaps
you
don
t
know
what
a
bureau
learn
very
little
at
school
i
will
tell
you
that
a
bureau
is
a
kind
of
chest
of
drawers
sometimes
it
has
a
bookcase
on
the
top
of
it
and
instead
of
the
two
little
top
corner
drawers
like
the
chests
of
drawers
in
a
bedroom
it
has
a
sloping
lid
and
when
it
is
quite
open
you
pull
out
two
little
boards
then
it
makes
a
sort
of
shelf
for
people
to
write
letters
on
the
shelf
lies
quite
flat
and
lets
you
see
little
drawers
inside
with
mother
of
pearl
a
row
of
pigeon
which
are
not
holes
pigeons
live
in
but
places
for
keeping
the
letters
could
carry
round
their
necks
if
they
liked
and
there
is
very
often
a
tiny
cupboard
in
the
middle
of
the
bureau
with
a
pattern
on
the
door
in
different
coloured
woods
so
now
you
know
fabian
stood
first
on
one
leg
and
then
on
the
other
till
rosamund
well
you
might
as
well
pull
up
your
so
he
did
his
stockings
were
always
just
like
a
concertina
or
a
very
expensive
photographic
camera
but
he
used
to
say
it
was
not
his
fault
and
i
suppose
he
knew
best
then
he
i
say
rom
mother
only
said
we
weren
t
to
the
two
i
like
to
be
good
said
rosamund
i
to
be
good
said
fabian
but
if
you
took
the
little
thin
poker
that
is
not
kept
for
best
you
could
put
it
through
one
of
the
brass
handles
and
i
could
hold
the
other
handle
with
the
tongs
and
then
we
could
open
the
drawer
without
touching
so
we
could
how
clever
you
are
fabe
said
rosamund
and
she
admired
her
brother
very
much
so
they
took
the
poker
and
the
tongs
the
front
of
the
bureau
got
a
little
scratched
but
the
top
drawer
came
open
and
there
they
saw
two
boxes
with
glass
tops
and
narrow
gold
paper
going
all
round
though
you
could
only
see
paper
shavings
through
the
glass
they
knew
it
was
soldiers
besides
these
boxes
there
was
a
doll
and
a
donkey
standing
on
a
green
grass
plot
that
had
wooden
wheels
and
a
little
doll
s
cradle
and
some
brass
cannons
and
a
bag
that
looked
like
marbles
and
some
flags
and
a
mouse
that
seemed
as
though
it
moved
with
clockwork
only
of
course
they
had
promised
not
to
touch
the
drawer
so
they
could
not
make
sure
there
was
a
wooden
box
too
and
it
was
wrong
way
up
and
on
the
bottom
of
it
was
written
in
pencil
vill
and
anim
they
looked
at
each
other
and
fabian
said
i
wish
it
was
you
have
seen
that
fabian
was
quite
a
clever
boy
and
he
knew
at
once
that
these
were
the
christmas
presents
which
santa
claus
had
brought
for
him
and
rosamund
but
rosamund
said
oh
dear
i
wish
we
hadn
t
however
she
consented
to
open
the
other
touching
it
of
course
because
she
had
promised
when
with
the
poker
and
tongs
the
other
drawer
came
open
there
were
large
wooden
kind
that
hold
raisins
and
round
boxes
with
paper
on
the
top
and
folded
in
pleats
round
the
edge
and
the
children
knew
what
was
inside
without
looking
every
one
knows
what
candied
fruit
looks
like
on
the
outside
of
the
box
there
were
square
boxes
kind
that
have
crackers
a
cracker
going
off
on
the
lid
very
different
in
size
and
brightness
from
what
it
does
really
for
as
no
doubt
you
know
a
cracker
very
often
comes
in
two
quite
calmly
without
any
pop
at
all
and
then
you
only
have
the
motto
and
the
sweet
which
is
never
nice
of
course
if
there
is
anything
else
in
the
cracker
such
as
brooches
or
rings
you
have
to
let
the
little
girl
who
sits
next
you
at
supper
have
it
when
they
had
pushed
back
the
drawer
fabian
let
us
pull
out
the
writing
drawer
and
make
a
so
they
pulled
the
drawer
out
and
put
it
on
the
floor
please
do
not
try
to
do
this
if
your
father
has
a
bureau
because
it
leads
to
trouble
it
was
only
because
this
one
was
broken
that
they
were
able
to
do
it
then
they
began
to
build
they
had
the
two
boxes
of
wooden
bricks
with
the
pillars
and
the
coloured
glass
windows
and
the
rational
bricks
which
are
made
of
clay
like
tiles
and
their
father
called
them
the
bricks
which
seems
silly
only
of
course
people
always
talk
sense
when
all
the
bricks
were
used
up
they
got
the
pretty
picture
blocks
that
kind
uncle
thomas
gave
them
and
they
built
with
these
but
one
box
of
blocks
does
not
go
far
picture
blocks
are
only
good
for
building
except
just
at
first
when
you
have
made
the
pictures
a
few
times
you
know
exactly
how
they
go
and
then
what
s
the
good
this
is
a
fault
which
belongs
to
many
very
expensive
toys
these
blocks
had
six
castle
with
the
royal
standard
hoisted
ducks
in
a
pond
with
a
very
handsome
green
and
blue
drake
rebecca
at
the
well
a
snowball
none
of
the
boys
knew
how
to
chuck
a
snowball
the
harvest
home
and
the
death
of
nelson
these
did
not
go
far
as
i
said
there
are
six
times
as
few
blocks
as
there
are
pictures
because
every
block
has
six
sides
if
you
don
t
understand
this
it
shows
they
don
t
teach
arithmetic
at
your
school
or
else
that
you
don
t
do
your
home
lessons
but
the
best
of
a
library
is
the
books
rosamund
and
fabian
made
up
with
books
they
got
shakespeare
in
fourteen
volumes
and
rollin
s
ancient
history
and
gibbon
s
decline
and
fall
and
the
beauties
of
literature
in
fat
little
volumes
and
they
built
not
only
a
castle
but
a
a
big
presently
towered
high
above
them
on
the
top
of
the
bureau
it
s
almost
big
enough
to
get
into
said
fabian
if
we
had
some
so
they
made
steps
with
the
british
essayists
the
spectator
and
the
rambler
and
the
observer
and
the
tatler
and
when
the
steps
were
done
they
walked
up
them
you
may
think
that
they
could
not
have
walked
up
these
steps
and
into
a
town
they
had
built
themselves
but
i
assure
you
people
have
often
done
it
and
anyway
this
is
a
true
story
they
had
made
a
lovely
gateway
with
two
fat
volumes
of
macaulay
and
milton
s
poetical
works
on
top
and
as
they
went
through
it
they
felt
all
the
feelings
which
people
have
to
feel
when
they
are
tourists
and
see
really
fine
architecture
architecture
means
buildings
but
it
is
a
grander
word
as
you
see
rosamund
and
fabian
simply
walked
up
the
steps
into
the
town
they
had
built
whether
they
got
larger
or
the
town
got
smaller
i
do
not
pretend
to
say
when
they
had
gone
under
the
great
gateway
they
found
that
they
were
in
a
street
which
they
could
not
remember
building
but
they
were
not
disagreeable
about
it
and
they
said
it
was
a
very
nice
street
all
the
same
there
was
a
large
square
in
the
middle
of
the
town
with
seats
and
there
they
sat
down
in
the
town
they
had
made
and
wondered
how
they
could
have
been
so
clever
as
to
build
it
then
they
went
to
the
walls
of
the
strong
walls
built
of
the
encyclopedia
and
the
biographical
far
away
over
the
brown
plain
of
the
carpet
they
saw
a
great
thing
like
a
square
mountain
it
was
very
shiny
and
as
they
looked
at
it
a
great
slice
of
it
pushed
itself
out
and
fabian
saw
the
brass
handles
shine
and
he
said
why
rom
that
s
the
it
s
larger
than
i
want
it
to
be
said
rosamund
who
was
a
little
frightened
and
indeed
it
did
seem
to
be
an
extra
size
for
it
was
higher
than
the
town
the
drawer
of
the
great
mountain
bureau
opened
slowly
and
the
children
could
see
something
moving
inside
then
they
saw
the
glass
lid
of
one
of
the
boxes
go
slowly
up
till
it
stood
on
end
and
looked
like
one
side
of
the
crystal
palace
it
was
so
inside
the
box
they
saw
something
moving
the
shavings
and
and
the
heaved
and
tossed
like
a
sea
when
it
is
rough
and
you
wish
you
had
not
come
for
a
sail
and
then
from
among
the
heaving
whiteness
came
out
a
blue
soldier
and
another
and
another
they
let
themselves
down
from
the
drawer
with
ropes
of
shavings
and
when
they
were
all
out
there
were
fifty
of
soldiers
with
rifles
and
fixed
bayonets
as
well
as
a
thin
captain
on
a
horse
and
a
sergeant
and
a
drummer
the
drummer
beat
his
drum
and
the
whole
company
formed
fours
and
marched
straight
for
the
town
they
seemed
to
be
quite
large
the
children
were
very
frightened
they
left
the
walls
and
ran
up
and
down
the
streets
of
the
town
trying
to
find
a
place
to
hide
oh
there
s
our
very
own
house
cried
rosamund
at
last
we
shall
be
safe
she
was
surprised
as
well
as
pleased
to
find
their
own
house
inside
the
town
they
had
built
so
they
ran
in
and
into
the
library
and
there
was
the
bureau
and
the
castle
they
had
built
and
it
was
all
small
and
quite
the
proper
size
but
when
they
looked
out
of
the
window
it
was
not
their
own
street
but
the
one
they
had
built
they
could
see
two
volumes
of
the
beauties
of
literature
and
the
head
of
rebecca
in
the
house
opposite
and
down
the
street
was
the
mausoleum
they
had
built
after
the
pattern
given
in
the
red
and
yellow
book
that
goes
with
the
bricks
it
was
all
very
confusing
suddenly
as
they
stood
looking
out
of
the
windows
they
heard
a
shouting
and
there
were
the
blue
soldiers
coming
along
the
street
by
twos
and
when
the
captain
got
opposite
their
house
he
called
fabian
rosamund
come
down
and
they
had
to
for
they
were
very
much
frightened
then
the
captain
we
have
taken
this
town
and
you
are
our
prisoners
do
not
attempt
to
escape
or
i
don
t
know
what
will
happen
to
the
children
explained
that
they
had
built
the
town
so
they
thought
it
was
theirs
but
the
captain
said
very
that
doesn
t
follow
at
all
it
s
our
town
now
and
i
want
provisions
for
my
we
haven
t
any
said
fabian
but
rosamund
nudged
him
and
said
won
t
the
soldiers
be
very
fierce
if
they
are
hungry
the
blue
captain
heard
her
and
you
are
quite
right
little
girl
if
you
have
any
food
produce
it
it
will
be
a
generous
act
and
may
stop
any
unpleasantness
my
soldiers
very
fierce
besides
he
added
in
a
lower
tone
speaking
behind
his
hand
you
need
only
feed
the
soldiers
in
the
usual
when
the
children
heard
this
their
minds
were
made
up
if
you
do
not
mind
waiting
a
minute
said
fabian
politely
i
will
bring
down
any
little
things
i
can
then
he
took
his
tongs
and
rosamund
took
the
poker
and
they
opened
the
drawer
where
the
raisins
and
figs
and
dried
fruits
everything
in
the
library
in
the
town
was
just
the
same
as
in
the
library
at
they
carried
them
out
into
the
big
square
where
the
captain
had
drawn
up
his
blue
regiment
and
here
the
soldiers
were
fed
i
suppose
you
know
how
tin
soldiers
are
fed
but
children
learn
so
little
at
school
nowadays
that
i
daresay
you
don
t
so
i
will
tell
you
you
just
put
a
bit
of
the
fig
or
raisin
or
whatever
it
is
on
the
soldier
s
tin
his
sword
if
he
is
a
cavalry
you
let
it
stay
on
till
you
are
tired
of
playing
at
giving
the
soldiers
rations
and
then
of
course
eat
it
for
this
was
the
way
in
which
fabian
and
rosamund
fed
the
starving
blue
soldiers
but
when
they
had
done
so
the
soldiers
were
as
hungry
as
ever
which
only
shows
that
soldiers
are
an
ungrateful
lot
and
it
is
idle
to
try
and
make
their
lives
better
and
brighter
so
then
the
blue
captain
who
had
not
had
anything
even
on
the
point
of
his
sword
my
gallant
men
are
fainting
for
lack
of
so
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
bring
out
the
candied
fruits
and
to
feed
the
soldiers
with
them
so
fabian
and
rosamund
stuck
bits
of
candied
apricot
and
fig
and
pear
and
cherry
and
beetroot
on
the
tops
of
the
soldiers
bayonets
and
when
every
soldier
had
a
piece
they
put
a
fat
candied
cherry
on
the
officer
s
sword
then
the
children
knew
the
soldiers
would
be
quiet
for
a
few
minutes
and
they
ran
back
into
their
own
house
and
into
the
library
to
talk
to
each
other
about
what
they
had
better
do
for
they
both
felt
that
the
blue
soldiers
were
a
very
set
of
men
they
might
shut
us
up
in
the
dungeons
said
rosamund
and
then
mother
might
lock
us
in
when
she
shut
up
the
lid
of
the
bureau
and
we
should
starve
to
for
they
could
not
be
sure
exactly
what
size
they
were
or
which
library
their
mother
would
come
back
to
when
she
had
given
away
all
the
flannel
petticoats
and
things
the
dungeons
were
the
of
the
bureau
and
the
doors
of
them
were
the
little
beauties
of
literature
heavy
doors
they
were
too
you
see
the
curious
thing
was
that
the
children
had
built
a
town
and
got
into
it
and
in
it
they
had
found
their
own
house
with
the
very
town
they
had
one
exactly
like
on
the
library
floor
i
think
it
s
all
nonsense
said
rosamund
but
when
they
looked
out
of
the
window
there
was
the
house
with
windsor
castle
and
the
head
of
rebecca
just
opposite
if
we
could
only
find
mother
she
said
but
they
knew
without
looking
that
mother
was
not
in
the
house
that
they
were
in
then
i
wish
we
had
that
mouse
that
looked
like
the
donkey
and
the
other
box
of
they
are
red
ones
and
they
would
fight
the
blue
and
lick
are
english
and
they
always
win
said
fabian
and
then
rosamund
oh
fabe
i
believe
we
could
go
into
town
too
if
we
tried
let
us
put
all
the
things
in
and
then
try
so
they
went
to
the
bureau
drawer
and
rosamund
got
out
the
other
box
of
soldiers
and
the
a
clockwork
the
donkey
with
panniers
and
put
them
in
the
town
while
fabian
ate
up
a
few
odd
raisins
that
had
dropped
on
the
floor
when
all
the
soldiers
they
red
were
arranged
on
the
ramparts
of
the
little
town
fabian
i
am
thinking
of
all
the
raisins
and
things
on
the
soldiers
bayonets
outside
it
seems
a
pity
not
to
eat
the
things
for
but
rosamund
no
no
let
s
get
into
this
town
and
perhaps
we
shall
be
safe
from
the
blue
soldiers
oh
fabe
never
mind
the
raisins
but
fabian
said
i
don
t
want
you
to
come
if
you
re
frightened
i
ll
go
alone
who
s
afraid
so
then
of
course
rosamund
said
she
would
come
with
him
so
they
went
out
and
ate
the
things
for
the
soldiers
leaving
the
captain
s
cherry
for
the
last
and
when
that
was
eaten
they
ran
as
hard
as
they
could
back
to
their
house
and
into
the
library
where
the
town
was
on
the
floor
with
the
little
red
soldiers
on
the
ramparts
i
m
sure
we
can
get
into
this
town
cried
fabian
and
sure
enough
they
did
just
as
they
had
done
into
the
first
one
whether
they
got
smaller
or
the
town
got
larger
i
leave
you
to
decide
and
it
was
exactly
the
same
sort
of
town
as
the
other
so
now
they
were
in
a
town
built
in
a
library
in
a
house
in
a
town
built
in
a
library
in
a
house
in
a
town
called
the
town
they
were
in
now
had
red
soldiers
in
it
and
they
felt
quite
safe
and
the
union
jack
was
stuck
up
over
the
gateway
it
was
a
stiff
little
flag
they
had
found
with
some
others
in
the
bureau
drawer
it
was
meant
to
be
stuck
in
the
christmas
pudding
but
they
had
stuck
it
between
two
blocks
and
put
it
over
the
gate
of
their
town
they
walked
about
this
town
and
found
their
own
house
just
as
before
and
went
in
and
there
was
the
toy
town
on
the
floor
and
you
will
see
that
they
might
have
walked
into
that
town
also
but
they
saw
that
it
was
no
good
and
that
they
couldn
t
get
out
that
way
but
would
only
get
deeper
and
deeper
into
a
nest
of
towns
in
libraries
in
houses
in
towns
in
libraries
in
houses
in
towns
in
and
so
on
for
like
chinese
multiplied
by
millions
and
millions
for
ever
and
ever
and
they
did
not
like
even
to
think
of
this
because
of
course
they
would
be
getting
further
and
further
from
home
every
time
and
when
fabian
explained
all
this
to
rosamund
she
said
he
made
her
head
ache
and
she
began
to
cry
then
fabian
thumped
her
on
the
back
and
told
her
not
to
be
a
little
silly
for
he
was
a
very
kind
brother
and
he
come
out
and
let
s
see
if
the
soldiers
can
tell
us
what
to
so
they
went
out
but
the
red
soldiers
said
they
knew
nothing
but
drill
and
even
the
red
captain
said
he
really
couldn
t
advise
then
they
met
the
clockwork
mouse
he
was
big
like
an
elephant
and
the
donkey
with
panniers
was
as
big
as
a
mastodon
or
a
megatherium
if
they
teach
you
anything
at
school
of
course
they
have
taught
you
all
about
the
megatherium
and
the
mastodon
the
mouse
kindly
stopped
to
speak
to
the
children
and
rosamund
burst
into
tears
again
and
said
she
wanted
to
go
home
the
great
mouse
looked
down
at
her
and
i
am
sorry
for
but
your
brother
is
the
kind
of
child
that
overwinds
clockwork
mice
the
very
first
day
he
has
them
i
prefer
to
stay
this
then
fabian
said
on
my
honour
i
won
t
if
we
get
back
home
i
ll
give
you
to
rosamund
that
is
supposing
i
get
you
for
one
of
my
christmas
the
donkey
with
panniers
and
you
won
t
put
coals
in
my
panniers
or
unglue
my
feet
from
my
green
because
i
look
more
natural
without
wheels
i
give
you
my
word
said
fabian
i
wouldn
t
think
of
such
a
very
well
said
the
mouse
then
i
will
tell
you
it
is
a
great
secret
but
there
is
only
one
way
to
get
out
of
this
kind
of
town
hardly
know
how
to
just
out
of
the
you
dear
me
said
rosamund
i
never
thought
of
that
so
they
all
went
to
the
gate
of
the
town
and
walked
out
and
there
they
were
in
the
library
again
but
when
they
looked
out
of
the
window
the
mausoleum
was
still
to
be
seen
and
the
terrible
blue
soldiers
what
are
we
to
do
now
asked
rosamund
but
the
clockwork
mouse
and
the
donkey
with
panniers
were
their
proper
size
again
now
or
else
the
children
had
got
bigger
it
is
no
use
asking
me
which
for
i
do
not
know
and
so
of
course
they
could
not
speak
we
must
walk
out
of
this
town
as
we
did
out
of
the
other
said
fabian
yes
rosamund
said
only
this
town
if
full
of
blue
soldiers
and
i
am
afraid
of
them
don
t
you
think
it
would
do
if
we
out
so
out
they
ran
and
down
the
steps
that
were
made
of
the
spectator
and
the
rambler
and
the
tatler
and
the
and
directly
they
stood
on
the
brown
library
carpet
they
ran
to
the
window
and
looked
out
and
they
of
the
building
with
windsor
castle
and
rebecca
s
head
in
it
and
the
saw
their
own
road
with
the
trees
without
any
leaves
and
the
man
was
just
going
along
lighting
the
lamps
with
the
stick
that
the
pops
out
of
like
a
bird
to
roost
in
the
glass
cage
at
the
top
of
the
so
they
knew
that
they
were
safe
at
home
again
and
as
they
stood
looking
out
they
heard
the
library
door
open
and
mother
s
voice
what
a
dreadful
muddle
and
what
have
you
done
with
the
raisins
and
the
candied
fruits
and
her
voice
was
very
grave
indeed
now
you
will
see
that
it
was
quite
impossible
for
fabian
and
rosamund
to
explain
to
their
mother
what
they
had
done
with
the
raisins
and
things
and
how
they
had
been
in
a
town
in
a
library
in
a
house
in
a
town
they
had
built
in
their
own
library
with
the
books
and
the
bricks
and
the
pretty
picture
blocks
kind
uncle
thomas
gave
them
because
they
were
much
younger
than
i
am
and
even
i
have
found
it
rather
hard
to
explain
so
rosamund
said
oh
mother
my
head
does
ache
so
and
began
to
cry
and
fabian
said
nothing
but
he
also
began
to
cry
and
mother
said
i
don
t
wonder
your
head
aches
after
all
those
sweet
and
she
looked
as
if
she
would
like
to
cry
too
i
don
t
know
what
daddy
will
say
said
mother
and
then
she
gave
them
each
a
nasty
powder
and
put
them
both
to
bed
i
wonder
what
he
say
said
fabian
just
before
he
went
to
sleep
don
t
know
said
rosamund
and
strange
to
say
they
don
t
know
to
this
hour
what
daddy
said
because
next
day
they
both
had
measles
and
when
they
got
better
every
one
had
forgotten
about
what
had
happened
on
christmas
eve
and
fabian
and
rosamund
had
forgotten
just
as
much
as
everybody
else
so
i
should
never
have
heard
of
it
but
for
the
clockwork
mouse
it
was
he
who
told
me
the
story
just
as
the
children
told
it
to
him
in
the
town
in
the
library
in
the
house
in
the
town
they
built
in
their
own
library
with
the
books
and
the
bricks
and
the
pretty
picture
blocks
which
were
given
to
them
by
kind
uncle
thomas
and
if
you
do
not
believe
the
story
it
is
not
my
fault
i
believe
every
word
the
mouse
said
for
i
know
the
good
character
of
that
clockwork
mouse
and
i
know
it
could
not
tell
an
untruth
even
if
it
tried
plush
there
was
a
knock
at
the
king
s
study
door
the
king
looked
up
from
his
plans
for
the
new
municipal
washhouses
and
sighed
for
that
was
the
knock
that
had
come
to
his
door
since
breakfast
come
in
said
the
king
wearily
and
the
lord
chief
came
in
he
wore
a
white
gown
and
carried
a
white
wand
if
you
had
been
there
you
would
have
noticed
how
clean
the
king
s
study
looked
all
the
books
were
bound
in
white
vellum
and
the
floor
was
covered
with
white
matting
and
the
window
curtains
were
of
white
silk
of
course
it
would
not
be
right
for
every
one
to
have
such
things
even
if
we
were
all
kings
because
it
would
make
such
a
lot
of
work
for
the
servants
but
this
king
whose
name
was
alban
had
an
excellent
housekeeper
she
did
all
the
cooking
and
cleaned
everything
by
white
magic
which
is
better
even
than
if
you
know
what
that
is
and
only
took
the
good
lady
five
minutes
every
morning
i
am
extremely
sorry
to
disturb
your
majesty
said
the
lord
chief
but
your
majesty
s
brother
negretti
has
called
in
from
the
golden
indies
and
he
says
he
can
t
stay
more
than
half
an
the
king
jumped
up
knocking
over
the
white
wood
table
where
the
white
books
were
we
call
them
blue
books
in
england
but
the
insides
are
just
as
dull
whatever
colour
you
put
outside
my
dear
brother
i
haven
t
seen
him
since
we
were
boys
together
he
cried
and
ran
out
to
meet
him
tucking
up
his
royal
white
velvet
robes
to
run
the
quicker
down
the
cool
marble
corridors
at
the
front
door
of
the
palace
was
the
king
s
brother
just
getting
off
his
elephant
he
was
a
brown
and
yellow
brother
withered
and
shrivelled
like
a
very
old
apple
and
dressed
in
a
suite
of
plush
of
a
bright
orange
sown
thick
with
emeralds
all
the
white
marble
terrace
in
front
of
the
palace
was
crowded
with
the
retinue
of
the
new
arrival
slaves
of
all
brown
yellow
and
cream
colour
dressed
in
all
sorts
of
bright
hues
scarlet
and
blue
and
purple
and
orange
with
rubies
and
sapphires
and
amethysts
and
topazes
sewn
thickly
on
them
so
that
the
eye
could
hardly
bear
the
glow
and
glitter
of
them
as
they
shone
in
the
sunlight
on
the
terrace
welcome
welcome
king
alban
cried
and
kissed
his
brother
on
both
cheeks
as
is
the
fashion
in
albanatolia
and
in
many
other
civilised
lands
then
still
holding
him
by
both
hands
he
led
him
into
the
palace
the
jewelled
gorgeous
retinue
followed
him
in
and
the
head
shut
the
front
door
and
put
the
chain
up
because
she
knew
it
to
be
more
than
possible
that
a
few
odd
rubies
and
sapphires
and
things
would
drop
off
the
retinue
on
to
the
floor
and
she
thought
any
such
little
odds
and
ends
might
as
well
go
into
her
when
she
swept
up
after
lunch
as
into
the
pockets
of
any
poor
people
who
might
look
in
during
the
afternoon
to
ask
the
king
s
advice
as
they
were
fond
of
doing
this
was
the
beginning
of
the
trouble
that
was
wrought
by
the
coming
of
the
king
s
brother
before
this
every
door
stood
unfastened
all
day
long
because
every
one
was
contented
and
therefore
honest
king
alban
entertained
his
brother
royally
for
seven
days
in
the
good
old
fashion
and
then
gave
him
a
palace
of
his
own
to
live
in
the
palace
was
of
white
marble
like
most
of
the
buildings
in
albanatolia
but
the
king
s
brother
had
it
painted
red
all
over
without
a
moment
s
delay
and
then
he
began
to
give
parties
and
to
have
processions
and
to
scatter
money
among
the
crowd
and
every
day
the
people
loved
him
more
he
was
a
loud
jolly
joking
sort
of
man
with
a
black
beard
and
he
always
wore
clothes
of
plush
a
material
hitherto
unknown
and
he
always
blazed
with
jewels
and
he
had
a
circus
set
up
at
his
own
expense
in
the
field
at
the
back
of
his
palace
and
he
introduced
and
animated
highly
thus
became
extraordinarily
popular
so
much
so
that
the
people
presently
began
to
forget
all
the
good
that
king
alban
had
done
for
them
and
to
wish
secretly
that
the
kingdom
had
happened
to
have
a
bright
cheerful
king
like
prince
negretti
for
king
alban
had
worked
so
hard
for
his
people
s
good
that
he
had
not
had
time
to
be
amusing
he
had
never
had
processions
and
circuses
preferring
rather
small
with
the
lord
chief
the
commissioner
of
public
health
and
a
few
chosen
spirits
from
the
education
department
and
loving
best
of
all
to
wander
alone
dreaming
among
the
blossoming
orchards
or
in
the
meadows
beyond
the
river
where
the
white
jonquils
grew
or
in
the
lanes
between
the
pearly
or
in
the
terraced
garden
of
his
palace
where
the
white
roses
hung
in
clusters
and
the
white
peacocks
spread
their
tails
upon
the
marble
balustrades
and
wherever
he
went
he
thought
of
the
people
s
good
and
devised
new
ways
of
making
them
comfortable
everything
was
beautifully
managed
every
one
had
enough
to
wear
and
enough
to
eat
and
enough
to
do
which
is
very
important
but
they
had
not
enough
to
play
at
and
this
was
what
made
them
ready
to
lend
long
and
discontented
ears
to
the
whispers
of
the
king
s
brother
illustration
welcome
welcome
now
negretti
was
a
magician
and
his
was
the
black
or
coloured
magic
which
won
t
wash
clothes
he
was
always
messing
about
with
acids
and
alkalis
and
sulphites
and
bicarbonates
and
retorts
and
furnaces
and
and
pestles
and
mortars
and
the
like
and
whenever
he
happened
to
make
a
nice
colour
by
mixing
two
or
more
of
these
things
together
he
always
put
it
in
a
bottle
and
stuck
it
up
in
one
of
the
palace
windows
so
that
at
night
his
windows
were
brighter
than
any
chemist
s
and
druggist
s
in
any
street
and
the
people
said
it
was
as
good
as
fireworks
the
king
s
palace
windows
only
sent
out
a
soft
white
light
like
moonlight
and
this
was
now
considered
very
tame
it
was
the
magician
s
habit
to
wander
about
the
town
stirring
up
discontent
as
easily
as
if
it
had
been
one
of
his
chemical
messes
and
though
he
was
so
well
known
among
the
people
he
was
never
recognised
because
he
always
took
care
to
disguise
himself
as
a
respectable
person
and
the
disguise
was
quite
impenetrable
i
hope
you
know
what
that
is
one
night
he
sat
disguised
at
the
king
s
finest
of
the
municipal
dog
out
of
a
and
the
grumbling
of
the
people
was
music
in
his
wicked
ears
alban
is
not
my
sort
of
king
said
the
blacksmith
i
d
make
a
better
king
out
of
a
penn
orth
of
putty
any
day
of
the
week
said
the
painter
what
s
the
good
of
a
king
if
you
never
see
him
said
the
landlady
no
processions
no
flags
no
gilt
coaches
no
rubies
and
diamonds
and
sapphires
no
royal
robes
of
purple
and
as
a
loyal
country
has
a
right
to
expect
on
its
sovereign
s
back
only
that
old
white
thing
said
the
barmaid
no
better
than
a
velvet
nightgown
said
the
landlady
i
like
a
bit
of
colour
i
do
said
the
painter
graining
i
don
t
ask
for
for
he
s
not
had
the
education
to
know
its
beauty
but
a
good
warm
maroon
or
a
royal
blue
now
but
no
it
s
white
white
white
till
i
m
sick
of
it
and
us
all
wearing
white
by
law
and
washing
done
free
by
white
magic
at
the
palace
on
mondays
from
to
and
no
one
to
have
more
than
a
quart
of
beer
of
an
evening
i
tell
you
what
it
is
my
boys
we
re
miserable
degraded
slaves
that
s
what
we
are
if
we
must
have
a
king
said
the
blacksmith
why
not
good
old
negretti
he
s
something
like
a
king
he
is
ah
if
he
only
knew
how
our
free
hearts
beat
with
him
he
d
be
sitting
on
the
throne
then
negretti
threw
off
his
pewter
with
the
municipal
arms
on
it
rolled
on
the
sanded
floor
and
spilt
what
was
left
of
the
dog
on
to
the
the
magician
stood
before
them
pale
but
firm
his
dark
lantern
in
his
hand
it
was
a
magic
lantern
of
course
slaves
he
cried
poor
benighted
oppressed
people
follow
me
let
us
dethrone
a
king
who
seeks
to
mask
tyranny
with
hypocritical
public
kitchens
and
cloaks
his
infamous
autocracy
with
free
washing
by
white
magic
on
a
monday
to
the
palace
to
the
palace
and
they
all
finished
up
their
beer
and
followed
him
and
half
the
town
beside
joined
the
throng
as
it
pressed
through
the
streets
towards
the
eastern
gate
beyond
which
was
the
king
s
palace
now
while
the
magician
was
drinking
his
dog
disguised
as
a
respectable
person
the
king
in
his
white
robes
was
walking
under
the
boughs
of
the
for
it
was
spring
and
the
moon
was
at
the
full
and
presently
coming
along
over
the
dewy
grey
grass
of
the
orchard
he
saw
a
figure
in
white
and
when
it
came
close
to
him
he
saw
that
it
was
a
lady
more
fair
than
the
fair
stars
of
that
fair
night
and
who
are
you
said
the
king
illustration
poor
benighted
oppressed
people
follow
me
i
am
a
poor
princess
seeking
my
fortune
said
she
you
will
rest
under
my
roof
said
the
king
and
led
her
through
the
long
sweet
grass
under
the
blossoming
boughs
to
the
palace
garden
when
they
came
to
the
terrace
the
princess
loosed
a
lantern
from
her
girdle
set
it
on
the
stone
balustrade
close
by
where
one
of
the
white
peacocks
perched
in
fluffy
feathery
slumber
kindled
it
and
threw
open
the
horn
door
a
flood
of
light
streamed
out
bright
as
spring
sunshine
and
fell
full
upon
her
and
then
the
king
saw
that
her
gown
was
not
white
as
it
had
seemed
in
the
moonlight
but
was
the
colour
of
yellow
gold
and
her
hair
was
red
gold
and
her
eyes
were
of
gold
and
grey
mingled
then
for
the
first
time
in
all
his
life
the
king
thought
of
himself
and
of
his
own
happiness
and
he
caught
her
hands
and
nothing
will
ever
again
content
me
not
even
doing
good
to
my
people
if
i
must
part
from
you
will
you
stay
and
be
my
queen
the
princess
said
i
am
seeking
my
fortune
do
you
think
you
are
it
i
do
not
know
my
dear
said
the
king
whether
i
am
your
fortune
but
i
know
well
enough
that
are
then
the
princess
clapped
her
hands
and
said
that
is
the
right
answer
i
have
travelled
half
round
the
world
to
hear
it
and
will
you
love
me
always
always
my
queen
said
he
exactly
the
same
as
you
will
love
me
we
are
not
of
the
race
that
changes
so
then
they
kissed
each
other
as
lovers
should
and
wandered
along
the
avenue
deep
in
lovers
talk
and
never
even
heard
the
crowd
that
the
magician
had
brought
to
the
front
door
so
when
the
crowd
found
that
the
palace
door
was
locked
for
the
night
it
went
home
again
but
it
came
back
in
the
morning
with
trumpets
and
banners
and
scraps
of
coloured
stuff
tied
over
its
white
clothing
and
the
king
went
out
to
meet
it
when
the
crowd
saw
him
every
one
began
to
shout
down
with
alban
down
with
the
white
king
free
beer
no
more
washing
and
things
like
that
then
the
king
stood
forth
and
what
have
i
done
but
seek
for
your
good
when
till
now
have
i
thought
of
my
own
happiness
who
has
stirred
you
up
to
these
ill
thoughts
of
me
my
people
my
own
beloved
people
have
my
ears
ever
been
closed
to
your
complaints
have
you
wrongs
tell
me
and
i
will
right
them
have
you
sorrows
make
them
known
and
let
me
soothe
them
do
you
not
know
that
your
king
is
your
servant
and
lives
but
to
do
you
good
and
the
crowd
grumbled
and
muttered
and
one
voice
we
don
t
want
to
be
done
good
to
we
want
to
enjoy
i
did
not
know
said
the
king
gently
but
now
you
have
spoken
i
will
at
once
appoint
a
minister
of
public
enjoyment
the
magician
was
watching
the
crowd
and
he
saw
how
the
sight
of
the
king
s
good
face
and
the
sound
of
his
good
voice
were
working
on
their
hearts
that
had
once
loved
him
now
negretti
sprang
forward
one
word
brother
he
cried
and
led
the
king
into
the
shadow
of
a
walk
the
moment
they
were
hidden
he
caught
his
brother
s
arm
and
whispered
a
wicked
spell
and
the
first
words
of
it
were
in
persian
and
the
next
in
greek
and
after
that
came
words
in
arabic
and
spanish
and
the
speech
of
the
county
of
essex
and
the
last
words
of
all
were
be
changed
to
a
and
so
strong
was
the
spell
that
the
king
was
turned
to
a
stone
that
very
great
white
fell
under
the
yew
hedge
and
lay
there
then
the
magician
said
ha
ha
and
after
waiting
so
long
as
he
deemed
prudent
he
went
back
to
the
people
and
i
regret
to
inform
you
that
your
king
has
proved
quite
unreliable
as
a
man
of
business
when
i
urged
him
to
sign
a
written
agreement
to
keep
you
always
in
a
good
humour
he
refused
and
then
he
remembered
an
urgent
appointment
in
nova
scotia
and
he
has
gone
and
taken
most
of
the
crown
treasure
with
him
but
do
not
despair
i
will
be
your
king
and
i
have
an
income
quite
sufficient
to
keep
up
a
small
establishment
of
my
own
and
my
golden
argosies
are
now
on
the
way
from
the
indies
bearing
all
manner
of
precious
things
and
bales
of
plush
are
on
their
way
from
yorkshire
so
now
i
am
the
people
believed
him
for
they
had
never
known
a
king
who
spoke
anything
but
the
truth
so
they
shouted
long
live
the
king
and
the
matter
was
settled
that
very
day
negretti
had
the
palace
painted
magenta
and
covered
all
the
and
mantelpieces
with
gold
paint
and
stuck
embossed
coloured
scraps
on
them
then
he
went
out
into
the
garden
to
get
a
good
look
at
his
magenta
palace
from
the
outside
and
as
he
went
along
the
walk
there
was
the
princess
perihelia
weeping
over
the
white
stone
what
are
you
crying
for
he
asked
i
m
crying
for
the
white
king
said
she
and
why
do
you
cry
said
the
magician
i
don
t
know
said
the
poor
princess
and
she
looked
so
beautiful
that
the
magician
went
straight
into
the
palace
and
told
the
prime
tailor
to
sew
new
rubies
all
over
his
new
purple
plush
suit
because
he
was
going
the
very
next
day
negretti
put
on
the
purple
plush
suit
as
well
as
the
royal
crown
and
went
to
the
wing
of
the
palace
which
the
white
king
had
set
apart
for
the
princess
perihelia
to
live
in
alban
s
crown
was
made
of
silver
and
pearls
and
moonstones
and
the
new
king
had
ordered
a
new
crown
all
gold
and
stuck
as
full
of
rubies
and
emeralds
and
sapphires
as
a
really
good
christmas
cake
is
of
plums
i
do
not
mean
the
cake
they
call
good
wholesome
school
cake
but
the
kind
they
have
at
home
when
there
is
a
party
he
took
all
his
retinue
with
him
and
they
waited
on
the
terrace
while
the
magician
knocked
at
the
door
come
in
said
the
princess
i
ve
come
to
marry
you
said
the
magician
coming
to
the
point
at
once
for
he
had
arranged
to
have
a
procession
that
afternoon
and
he
was
a
little
pressed
for
time
but
perihelia
said
no
thank
the
magician
could
hardly
believe
his
ears
but
you
ll
be
queen
of
the
land
said
he
and
that
s
what
you
d
have
been
if
you
d
married
my
brother
and
i
suppose
what
you
wanted
to
o
no
it
isn
t
said
she
well
what
did
you
want
said
he
i
wanted
to
be
the
white
king
s
wife
said
she
it
s
the
same
thing
he
said
but
she
said
no
it
isn
t
not
a
and
it
was
in
vain
that
he
showed
her
his
best
plush
suit
and
the
plush
suits
of
his
retainers
she
simply
wouldn
t
look
at
them
nor
at
the
precious
stones
either
so
at
last
he
went
off
to
his
palace
to
make
more
rubies
and
precious
stones
and
things
like
that
and
she
went
off
to
cry
over
the
white
stone
now
a
lot
of
had
built
their
nests
above
the
palace
and
some
of
them
flew
off
and
told
the
magician
how
perihelia
was
always
crying
in
the
yew
avenue
over
the
white
stone
so
he
said
to
his
slaves
get
a
and
carry
the
thing
on
to
the
middle
of
the
bridge
and
drop
it
into
the
so
they
did
and
the
stone
stuck
in
the
mud
and
when
the
golden
argosies
of
the
magician
came
up
the
river
bearing
peacocks
and
apes
and
turquoises
every
single
galley
split
on
that
stone
and
the
whole
treasure
went
to
the
bottom
all
but
the
peacocks
and
they
flew
away
into
the
country
of
a
neighbouring
king
who
thought
every
one
should
be
useful
and
not
ornamental
so
he
cut
off
the
peacocks
tails
and
clipped
their
wings
and
tried
to
teach
them
to
lay
turkey
s
eggs
but
it
is
very
difficult
to
get
a
peacock
to
do
anything
useful
so
then
the
magician
set
a
lot
of
people
dredging
for
the
lost
treasure
and
among
other
things
they
fished
up
some
poor
dead
apes
and
the
big
white
stone
and
as
the
stone
seemed
to
have
been
rather
in
the
way
in
the
bed
of
the
river
they
carted
it
away
to
the
fields
behind
the
town
where
the
white
jonquils
grew
and
dumped
it
down
there
and
left
it
among
the
long
grass
and
the
princess
could
not
come
and
cry
over
it
there
because
she
did
not
know
where
it
was
and
besides
she
was
very
busy
for
after
she
had
refused
to
marry
him
the
magician
said
very
well
then
you
can
just
do
the
free
washing
for
the
royal
housekeeper
had
given
five
minutes
notice
and
left
at
the
end
of
it
as
soon
as
the
new
king
had
the
palace
painted
magenta
and
no
one
else
knew
how
to
do
washing
by
white
magic
and
though
the
people
had
sneered
at
it
in
the
white
king
s
time
they
stood
out
for
it
now
and
said
free
washing
was
what
they
had
always
been
accustomed
to
poor
perihelia
did
not
know
the
white
magic
but
she
washed
by
the
sunlight
magic
and
everything
she
sent
home
from
the
wash
was
pinky
or
pearly
or
greeny
like
the
little
clouds
in
a
may
dawn
the
people
were
pleased
but
not
the
magician
i
like
a
colour
to
a
colour
he
said
i
hate
your
half
he
was
beginning
to
remodel
the
kingdom
to
his
own
fancy
instead
of
a
lord
chief
he
had
a
lord
chief
magician
and
instead
of
the
education
department
he
had
a
permanent
committee
of
black
and
coloured
magic
and
he
shut
up
the
free
washhouses
who
wants
to
wash
said
he
and
he
ordered
a
free
distribution
of
nasty
medicine
instead
and
altogether
he
was
really
beginning
to
enjoy
himself
when
another
came
fluttering
in
at
the
window
of
his
laboratory
and
perching
on
the
top
of
a
crucible
told
him
of
a
rumour
the
rumour
had
been
running
about
the
town
like
a
mad
thing
and
wherever
it
ran
it
left
its
tail
behind
it
rumour
as
you
know
is
a
beast
with
many
tales
and
now
everybody
knew
that
the
white
stone
had
moved
in
the
night
and
had
come
rolling
up
to
the
gate
of
the
town
whatever
shall
we
do
said
the
lord
chief
magician
who
was
pounding
up
nasty
things
in
the
mortar
ready
for
the
free
distribution
of
medicine
next
day
smash
it
said
negretti
i
ll
take
a
turn
at
the
medicine
while
you
go
and
see
the
thing
so
the
lord
chief
magician
called
together
the
permanent
committee
of
black
and
coloured
magic
and
sent
them
to
break
the
stone
and
when
they
began
to
hit
it
with
their
hammers
and
picks
seventeen
sharp
splinters
of
white
stone
flew
off
and
each
splinter
hit
a
member
of
the
committee
in
the
eye
and
killed
him
there
were
exactly
seventeen
members
as
it
happened
so
then
the
lord
chief
magician
shut
the
town
gates
and
ran
home
and
hid
under
the
bed
and
the
people
of
the
town
were
very
much
interested
in
the
stone
that
had
rolled
by
itself
and
had
killed
seventeen
members
of
the
committee
and
they
made
little
parties
and
picnics
all
day
long
taking
their
children
to
look
at
the
stone
and
carrying
sandwiches
with
them
and
bottles
of
beer
the
magician
was
very
angry
such
rubbish
i
never
heard
of
said
he
when
the
alighted
on
the
and
told
him
of
it
if
they
want
to
look
at
anything
why
can
t
they
come
and
look
at
i
m
sure
i
m
coloured
enough
that
night
the
stone
rose
up
in
the
thickest
of
the
black
dark
when
no
one
at
all
is
out
of
doors
except
the
not
always
it
smashed
through
the
town
gate
and
came
rolling
right
up
into
the
square
and
lay
there
the
awoke
the
magician
in
the
morning
by
singing
the
news
sharply
in
his
ear
and
he
went
out
to
see
there
was
a
great
crowd
in
the
square
and
they
all
cried
it
is
a
magic
stone
it
will
bring
us
luck
build
it
into
the
royal
i
might
do
worse
thought
negretti
if
good
roman
cement
and
a
double
coat
of
magenta
paint
doesn
t
keep
it
quiet
nothing
so
he
gave
orders
and
the
stone
was
carted
to
the
palace
and
built
into
the
wall
over
the
great
gate
and
while
they
were
gone
to
fetch
the
red
paint
to
cover
up
the
stone
and
the
mortar
the
lord
chief
magician
came
out
from
under
his
bed
and
went
sneaking
up
to
the
palace
and
in
at
the
gate
and
the
stone
fell
on
him
and
smashed
him
quite
flat
then
perihelia
came
running
out
and
she
washed
the
mortar
off
the
white
stone
by
her
sunlight
magic
and
when
the
magician
come
out
she
said
let
it
lie
here
and
if
you
will
let
me
go
i
will
take
it
away
to
my
own
kingdom
so
that
it
shall
never
trouble
you
negretti
agreed
because
he
did
not
know
what
else
to
do
and
he
was
beginning
to
despair
of
the
princess
ever
marrying
him
because
he
had
now
asked
her
to
do
so
every
day
for
a
month
and
always
with
more
display
of
plush
and
jewels
and
she
said
no
more
decidedly
and
even
crossly
every
time
so
he
began
to
lose
heart
that
night
just
when
the
moon
was
waning
and
before
morning
broke
princess
perihelia
slipped
down
the
palace
stairs
and
into
the
garden
to
look
once
more
on
the
place
where
the
white
king
had
promised
to
love
her
always
and
when
she
came
to
that
same
place
there
was
the
white
stone
lying
under
the
shadow
of
the
white
rose
bushes
and
pearly
rose
leaves
had
fallen
all
over
it
and
were
falling
still
like
tears
perihelia
knelt
down
beside
the
stone
and
put
her
arms
round
it
and
poor
stone
dear
stone
what
is
it
that
troubles
you
so
that
you
can
not
rest
if
i
only
knew
i
might
help
you
with
my
sunlight
magic
why
are
you
so
troubled
and
why
do
i
pity
you
so
oh
if
my
white
king
were
here
he
would
understand
and
help
you
but
i
can
do
nothing
with
that
she
began
to
weep
over
the
stone
calling
on
the
white
king
to
come
back
to
her
and
all
the
while
she
was
talking
and
weeping
the
moon
was
waning
and
the
light
in
the
east
grew
pearlier
and
prettier
minute
by
minute
and
as
she
wept
and
clasped
the
stone
she
presently
saw
in
the
glowing
light
that
the
stone
was
changing
in
her
arms
like
white
sands
falling
in
an
the
white
stone
fell
away
and
fell
away
until
the
sun
looked
through
the
white
rose
bushes
and
saw
perihelia
clasp
the
living
form
of
the
white
king
in
her
loving
arms
the
sun
s
was
not
the
only
eye
which
saw
that
meeting
the
magician
had
had
a
bad
night
and
he
came
out
early
curious
to
see
whether
the
stone
had
moved
again
his
curiosity
was
gratified
when
the
white
king
saw
his
treacherous
brother
his
tongue
was
kisses
had
been
speech
enough
for
he
spoke
the
words
which
he
found
in
his
mouth
and
they
were
naturally
enough
the
last
words
that
had
gone
in
at
his
ears
and
the
words
were
first
persian
and
then
greek
and
then
arabic
and
spanish
and
the
language
of
foreigners
from
essex
and
the
words
he
wound
up
with
were
be
changed
into
a
but
the
wicked
spell
that
had
turned
king
alban
into
a
stone
had
grown
weaker
by
keeping
as
even
port
did
when
it
was
kept
too
long
and
it
had
no
longer
power
to
do
what
it
ought
to
have
done
it
could
not
turn
the
wicked
magician
into
a
stone
as
i
am
sure
you
would
wish
it
to
have
done
it
was
only
strong
enough
to
turn
him
into
a
wooden
post
i
do
not
wish
to
have
to
mention
such
an
unpleasant
character
as
negretti
again
so
i
will
tell
you
at
once
the
end
of
him
he
remained
a
post
for
ever
and
ever
and
later
on
when
king
alban
had
begun
to
do
things
for
his
people
s
good
again
he
thought
it
a
pity
to
waste
even
a
post
for
he
was
ever
a
careful
king
so
he
had
it
made
into
a
pump
and
the
water
from
it
was
bitter
and
nasty
like
the
medicine
the
magician
used
to
give
the
people
and
it
was
very
good
for
children
and
gave
them
a
nice
bright
colour
in
their
cheeks
take
care
you
do
not
grow
pale
or
you
may
have
to
drink
the
water
out
of
that
pump
it
is
now
at
harrogate
or
epsom
or
bath
or
somewhere
and
you
might
quite
easily
be
taken
there
and
made
to
drink
that
unpleasant
water
the
first
persons
who
had
to
drink
it
were
the
magician
s
retinue
the
king
thought
it
would
be
good
for
them
and
they
were
very
grateful
but
the
next
night
they
stole
the
state
barge
and
went
home
by
sea
to
their
own
country
among
his
other
improvements
the
king
started
municipal
omnibuses
which
were
white
and
gold
but
the
pump
being
near
the
place
where
the
omnibuses
changed
horses
the
conductors
used
to
take
the
bitter
water
to
wash
the
omnibuses
with
and
gradually
they
became
scarlet
and
blue
and
green
and
violet
just
as
you
see
them
so
now
you
know
the
reason
of
the
colour
of
omnibuses
and
this
is
the
end
of
the
magician
s
part
of
the
story
when
the
magician
had
been
turned
into
a
post
the
king
i
m
very
sorry
but
the
princess
dear
he
deserved
it
and
being
a
post
is
not
painful
let
us
never
think
of
him
again
i
have
learned
many
things
since
i
came
here
i
have
something
to
break
to
you
do
you
think
you
can
bear
it
i
can
bear
anything
now
said
he
holding
her
in
his
arms
and
kissing
her
again
because
she
was
so
very
dear
well
said
perihelia
i
am
princess
of
the
sun
and
if
i
marry
you
my
own
dear
king
i
shan
t
be
able
to
help
colouring
your
pretty
white
kingdom
a
little
just
soft
sweet
colours
dear
and
not
an
inch
of
plush
we
ll
make
a
law
against
the
very
first
thing
and
you
shall
go
on
teaching
your
people
to
be
good
and
i
ll
try
to
teach
them
to
be
happy
do
you
think
i
can
the
white
king
smiled
you
ve
taught
he
said
but
now
before
we
do
anything
for
the
people
let
s
go
and
get
married
and
we
can
begin
to
make
the
new
laws
directly
we
ve
finished
breakfast
we
shall
just
have
time
to
be
married
if
we
go
off
to
church
at
so
they
went
off
and
woke
up
the
archbishop
and
were
married
and
the
archbishop
came
home
with
them
to
breakfast
and
afterwards
they
began
to
make
laws
as
hard
as
they
could
the
first
law
was
there
is
to
be
no
plush
at
all
in
this
and
now
albanatolia
is
the
most
beautiful
country
in
the
world
all
soft
sweet
colours
and
clear
pearly
white
and
the
queen
perihelia
has
taught
the
people
how
to
be
happy
so
the
king
has
very
little
work
to
do
for
they
are
good
almost
without
his
interfering
at
all
it
is
a
lovely
country
i
hope
you
will
go
there
some
day
i
went
there
once
but
they
would
not
let
me
stay
because
i
had
a
black
coat
on
and
gaiters
and
the
sight
of
these
clothes
made
the
people
so
unhappy
that
the
queen
asked
me
as
a
private
and
personal
favour
to
go
away
and
never
to
come
back
unless
i
could
come
dressed
in
something
like
the
colours
of
the
clouds
at
dawn
i
have
never
been
able
to
manage
this
and
anyway
i
don
t
suppose
i
could
find
the
way
there
now
but
if
you
could
get
the
proper
dress
perhaps
you
could
