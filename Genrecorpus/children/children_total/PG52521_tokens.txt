grimm
s
fairy
tales
printed
in
the
foreword
to
our
american
boys
and
girls
is
offered
this
volume
which
is
really
grimm
s
not
an
abridgment
superficial
and
colorless
nor
an
insipid
retelling
of
the
stories
this
edition
is
based
on
the
hunt
version
with
an
introduction
by
the
andrew
lang
the
hunt
version
is
considered
a
most
accurate
english
translation
from
the
full
collection
stories
suitable
for
children
have
been
selected
among
these
are
famous
tales
as
well
as
many
delightful
ones
not
usually
included
in
children
s
volumes
where
the
hunt
wording
is
too
stilted
the
text
of
the
itself
has
been
followed
the
very
long
sentences
have
been
subdivided
while
that
quaint
translation
illustrated
with
woodcuts
by
wehnert
has
contributed
its
bit
of
folk
phraseology
the
editor
s
desire
is
to
restore
to
the
children
as
large
a
collection
as
possible
of
grimm
s
unmutilated
in
their
literary
perfection
the
illustrations
are
by
the
dutch
artist
rie
cramer
some
of
rie
cramer
s
other
fairy
tale
pictures
published
in
england
are
said
by
admiring
critics
there
to
be
very
charming
of
exceptional
merit
and
to
have
high
artistic
merit
of
their
own
her
illustrations
for
grimm
are
particularly
harmonious
in
color
while
their
quaint
charm
grows
on
one
more
and
more
as
one
lives
with
them
they
are
fanciful
or
humorous
they
have
the
quality
rare
in
fairy
tales
of
actually
illustrating
their
text
this
will
mean
added
pleasure
to
the
children
rie
cramer
s
little
black
and
white
headings
are
particularly
pretty
and
graceful
in
outline
the
tales
are
presented
here
in
their
original
form
with
nothing
left
out
of
humor
poetic
feeling
and
delicate
sentiment
and
fancy
indeed
it
is
all
here
the
poesy
and
purity
which
those
profound
and
scholars
the
brothers
grimm
retained
in
the
old
which
with
so
much
pains
they
gathered
largely
from
among
the
themselves
and
the
brothers
explained
in
their
preface
that
they
had
planned
the
volume
as
an
educational
book
as
well
as
one
for
scholars
for
which
reason
they
had
eliminated
everything
which
they
feared
might
harm
the
children
but
since
the
brothers
issued
their
book
about
a
hundred
years
ago
educational
requirements
of
what
is
ethically
best
for
children
have
materially
advanced
therefore
in
this
book
a
few
other
parts
unsuitable
for
children
have
been
omitted
so
now
this
volume
of
grimm
s
is
offered
to
our
american
boys
and
girls
and
may
they
have
continued
delight
in
the
beautiful
old
which
have
come
down
to
us
from
the
fresh
and
sparkling
meadows
and
woods
of
ancient
days
fathers
and
mothers
too
will
enjoy
reading
the
tales
aloud
and
sharing
with
the
children
the
humor
and
the
deep
but
simple
ethical
truths
so
tenderly
and
poetically
set
forth
therein
teachers
and
also
may
find
in
this
sincere
version
rich
material
for
kindling
the
imagination
and
feeding
the
poetic
fancy

grimm
s
fairy
tales
the
or
iron
henry
in
old
times
when
wishing
was
having
there
lived
a
king
whose
daughters
were
all
beautiful
but
the
youngest
was
so
beautiful
that
the
sun
itself
which
has
seen
so
much
was
astonished
whenever
it
shone
in
her
face
close
by
the
king
s
castle
lay
a
great
dark
forest
and
under
an
old
in
the
forest
was
a
fountain
when
the
day
was
very
warm
the
king
s
child
went
out
into
the
forest
and
sat
down
by
the
side
of
the
cool
fountain
and
when
she
was
dull
she
took
a
golden
ball
and
threw
it
up
in
the
air
and
caught
it
and
this
ball
was
her
favorite
plaything
now
it
so
happened
one
day
the
king
s
daughter
s
golden
ball
did
not
fall
into
the
little
hand
which
she
was
holding
up
for
it
but
on
to
the
ground
and
rolled
straight
into
the
water
the
king
s
daughter
followed
it
with
her
eyes
but
it
vanished
and
the
well
was
deep
so
deep
that
the
bottom
could
not
be
seen
on
this
she
began
to
cry
and
cried
louder
and
louder
and
could
not
be
comforted
and
as
she
thus
lamented
some
one
said
to
her
what
ails
you
king
s
daughter
you
weep
so
that
even
a
stone
would
show
she
looked
round
to
the
side
from
whence
the
voice
came
and
saw
a
frog
stretching
its
thick
ugly
head
from
the
water
ah
old
is
it
you
said
she
i
am
weeping
for
my
golden
ball
which
has
fallen
into
the
be
quiet
and
do
not
weep
answered
the
frog
i
can
help
you
but
what
will
you
give
me
if
i
bring
your
plaything
up
again
whatever
you
will
have
dear
frog
said
she
my
clothes
my
pearls
and
jewels
and
even
the
golden
crown
which
i
am
the
frog
answered
i
do
not
care
for
your
clothes
your
pearls
and
jewels
or
your
golden
crown
but
if
you
will
love
me
and
let
me
be
your
companion
and
playfellow
and
sit
by
you
at
your
little
table
and
eat
off
your
little
golden
plate
and
drink
out
of
your
little
cup
and
sleep
in
your
little
bed
if
you
will
promise
me
this
i
will
go
down
below
and
bring
your
golden
ball
up
oh
yes
said
she
i
promise
you
all
you
wish
if
you
will
but
bring
my
ball
back
she
however
thought
how
the
silly
frog
does
talk
he
lives
in
the
water
with
the
other
frogs
and
croaks
and
can
be
no
companion
to
any
human
being
but
the
frog
when
he
had
received
this
promise
put
his
head
into
the
water
and
sank
down
in
a
short
time
he
came
swimming
up
again
with
the
ball
in
his
mouth
and
threw
it
on
the
grass
the
king
s
daughter
was
delighted
to
see
her
pretty
plaything
once
more
and
picked
it
up
and
ran
away
with
it
wait
wait
said
the
frog
take
me
with
you
i
can
t
run
as
you
but
what
did
it
avail
him
to
scream
his
croak
after
her
as
loudly
as
he
could
she
did
not
listen
to
it
but
ran
home
and
soon
forgot
the
poor
frog
who
was
forced
to
go
back
into
his
fountain
again
the
next
day
when
she
had
seated
herself
at
table
with
the
king
and
all
the
courtiers
and
was
eating
from
her
little
golden
plate
something
came
creeping
splash
splish
splash
up
the
marble
staircase
when
it
got
to
the
top
it
knocked
at
the
door
and
cried
s
daughter
youngest
open
the
door
she
ran
to
see
who
was
outside
but
when
she
opened
the
door
there
sat
the
frog
in
front
of
it
then
she
slammed
the
door
in
great
haste
sat
down
to
dinner
again
and
was
quite
frightened
the
king
saw
plainly
that
her
heart
was
beating
violently
and
said
my
child
what
are
you
so
afraid
of
is
there
a
giant
outside
who
wants
to
carry
you
away
ah
no
replied
she
it
is
no
giant
but
a
disgusting
what
does
the
frog
want
with
you
ah
dear
father
yesterday
when
i
was
in
the
forest
sitting
by
the
fountain
playing
my
golden
ball
fell
into
the
water
and
because
i
cried
so
the
frog
brought
it
out
again
for
me
and
because
he
insisted
so
on
it
i
promised
him
he
should
be
my
companion
but
i
never
thought
he
would
be
able
to
come
out
of
the
water
and
now
he
is
here
and
wants
to
come
in
the
meantime
it
knocked
a
second
time
and
cried
s
daughter
youngest
open
to
me
don
t
you
remember
yesterday
and
all
that
you
to
me
did
say
beside
the
cooling
fountain
s
spray
king
s
daughter
youngest
open
to
me
then
said
the
king
that
which
you
have
promised
you
must
perform
go
and
let
him
she
went
and
opened
the
door
and
the
frog
hopped
in
and
followed
her
step
by
step
to
her
chair
there
he
sat
still
and
cried
lift
me
up
beside
she
delayed
until
at
last
the
king
commanded
her
to
do
it
when
the
frog
was
once
on
the
chair
he
wanted
to
be
on
the
table
and
when
he
was
on
the
table
he
said
now
push
your
little
golden
plate
nearer
to
me
that
we
may
eat
she
did
this
but
it
was
easy
to
see
that
she
did
not
do
it
willingly
the
frog
enjoyed
what
he
ate
but
almost
every
mouthful
she
took
choked
her
at
length
he
said
i
have
eaten
and
am
satisfied
now
i
am
tired
carry
me
into
your
little
room
and
make
your
little
silken
bed
ready
and
we
will
both
lie
down
and
go
to
the
king
s
daughter
began
to
cry
for
she
was
afraid
of
the
cold
frog
which
she
did
not
like
to
touch
and
which
was
now
to
sleep
in
her
pretty
clean
little
bed
but
the
king
grew
angry
and
said
he
who
helped
you
when
you
were
in
trouble
ought
not
afterward
to
be
so
she
took
hold
of
the
frog
with
two
fingers
carried
him
upstairs
and
put
him
in
a
corner
but
when
she
was
in
bed
he
crept
to
her
and
said
i
am
tired
i
want
to
sleep
as
well
as
you
lift
me
up
or
i
will
tell
your
then
she
was
terribly
angry
and
took
him
up
and
threw
him
with
all
her
might
against
the
wall
now
you
will
be
quiet
odious
frog
said
she
but
when
he
fell
down
he
was
no
frog
but
a
king
s
son
with
beautiful
kind
eyes
he
by
her
father
s
will
was
now
her
dear
companion
and
husband
then
he
told
her
how
he
had
been
bewitched
by
a
wicked
witch
and
how
no
one
could
have
delivered
him
from
the
fountain
but
herself
and
that
they
would
go
together
into
his
kingdom
then
they
went
to
sleep
and
next
morning
when
the
sun
awoke
them
a
coach
came
rolling
up
drawn
by
eight
white
horses
with
white
ostrich
feathers
on
their
heads
they
were
harnessed
with
golden
chains
and
behind
stood
the
young
king
s
servant
faithful
henry
faithful
henry
had
been
so
unhappy
when
his
master
was
changed
into
a
frog
that
he
had
three
iron
bands
laid
round
his
heart
lest
it
should
burst
with
grief
and
sadness
the
coach
was
to
conduct
the
young
king
into
his
kingdom
faithful
henry
helped
them
both
in
and
placed
himself
behind
again
and
was
full
of
joy
because
of
this
deliverance
and
when
they
had
driven
a
part
of
the
way
the
king
s
son
heard
a
cracking
behind
him
as
if
something
had
broken
so
he
turned
round
and
cried
the
coach
does
break
no
my
lord
you
do
mistake
it
is
the
band
around
my
heart
that
felt
such
great
and
bitter
smart
when
you
were
in
the
fountain
strange
when
you
into
a
frog
were
changed
again
and
once
again
while
they
were
on
their
way
something
cracked
and
each
time
the
king
s
son
thought
the
carriage
was
breaking
but
it
was
only
the
bands
which
were
springing
from
the
heart
of
faithful
henry
because
his
master
was
set
free
and
was
happy
illustration
the
wolf
and
the
seven
little
kids
there
was
once
on
a
time
an
old
goat
who
had
seven
little
kids
and
loved
them
with
all
the
love
of
a
mother
for
her
children
one
day
she
wanted
to
go
into
the
forest
and
fetch
some
food
so
she
called
all
seven
to
her
and
said
dear
children
i
have
to
go
into
the
forest
be
on
your
guard
against
the
wolf
if
he
come
in
he
will
devour
you
all
skin
hair
and
all
the
wretch
often
disguises
himself
but
you
will
know
him
at
once
by
his
rough
voice
and
his
black
the
kids
said
dear
mother
we
will
take
good
care
of
ourselves
you
may
go
away
without
any
then
the
old
one
bleated
and
went
on
her
way
with
an
easy
mind
it
was
not
long
before
some
one
knocked
at
the
and
cried
open
the
door
dear
children
your
mother
is
here
and
has
brought
something
back
with
her
for
each
of
but
the
little
kids
knew
that
it
was
the
wolf
by
his
rough
voice
we
will
not
open
the
door
cried
they
you
are
not
our
mother
she
has
a
soft
pleasant
voice
but
your
voice
is
rough
you
are
the
wolf
then
the
wolf
went
away
to
a
shopkeeper
and
bought
a
great
lump
of
chalk
ate
this
and
made
his
voice
soft
with
it
then
he
came
back
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
house
and
cried
open
the
door
dear
children
your
mother
is
here
and
has
brought
something
back
with
her
for
each
of
but
the
wolf
had
laid
his
black
paws
against
the
window
and
the
children
saw
them
and
cried
we
will
not
open
the
door
our
mother
has
not
black
feet
like
you
you
are
the
wolf
then
the
wolf
ran
to
a
baker
and
said
i
have
hurt
my
feet
rub
some
dough
over
them
for
and
when
the
baker
had
rubbed
his
feet
over
he
ran
to
the
miller
and
said
strew
some
white
meal
over
my
feet
for
the
miller
thought
to
himself
the
wolf
wants
to
deceive
some
one
and
refused
but
the
wolf
said
if
you
will
not
do
it
i
will
devour
then
the
miller
was
afraid
and
made
his
paws
white
for
him
yes
so
are
men
now
the
wretch
went
for
the
third
time
to
the
knocked
at
it
and
said
open
the
door
for
me
children
your
dear
little
mother
has
come
home
and
has
brought
every
one
of
you
something
from
the
forest
with
the
little
kids
cried
first
show
us
your
paws
that
we
may
know
if
you
are
our
dear
little
then
he
put
his
paws
in
through
the
window
and
when
the
kids
saw
that
they
were
white
they
believed
all
that
he
said
and
opened
the
door
but
who
should
come
in
but
illustration
the
little
kids
cried
first
show
us
your
paws
they
were
terrified
and
wanted
to
hide
themselves
one
sprang
under
the
table
the
second
into
the
bed
the
third
into
the
stove
the
fourth
into
the
kitchen
the
fifth
into
the
cupboard
the
sixth
under
the
and
the
seventh
into
the
but
the
wolf
found
them
all
and
made
no
delay
but
swallowed
one
after
the
other
down
his
throat
the
youngest
in
the
was
the
only
one
he
did
not
find
when
the
wolf
had
satisfied
his
appetite
he
took
himself
off
laid
himself
down
under
a
tree
in
the
green
meadow
outside
and
began
to
sleep
soon
afterward
the
old
goat
came
home
again
from
the
forest
ah
what
a
sight
she
saw
there
the
stood
wide
open
the
table
chairs
and
benches
were
thrown
down
the
lay
broken
to
pieces
and
the
quilts
and
pillows
were
pulled
off
the
bed
she
sought
her
children
but
they
were
nowhere
to
be
found
she
called
them
one
after
another
by
name
but
no
one
answered
at
last
when
she
called
the
youngest
a
soft
voice
cried
dear
mother
i
am
in
the
she
took
the
kid
out
and
it
told
her
that
the
wolf
had
come
and
had
eaten
all
the
others
then
you
may
imagine
how
she
wept
over
her
poor
children
at
length
in
her
grief
she
went
out
and
the
youngest
kid
ran
with
her
when
they
came
to
the
meadow
there
lay
the
wolf
by
the
tree
and
he
was
snoring
so
loud
that
the
branches
shook
she
looked
at
him
on
every
side
and
saw
that
something
was
moving
and
struggling
in
his
stomach
ah
said
she
is
it
possible
that
my
poor
children
whom
he
has
swallowed
down
for
his
supper
can
be
still
alive
then
the
kid
had
to
run
home
and
fetch
scissors
and
a
needle
and
thread
and
the
goat
cut
open
the
monster
s
stomach
hardly
had
she
made
one
cut
than
a
little
kid
thrust
its
head
out
and
when
she
had
cut
farther
all
six
sprang
out
one
after
another
and
were
all
still
alive
and
had
suffered
no
hurt
whatever
for
in
his
greediness
the
monster
had
swallowed
them
whole
what
rejoicing
there
was
they
embraced
their
dear
mother
and
jumped
like
a
tailor
at
his
wedding
the
mother
however
said
now
go
and
look
for
some
big
stones
we
will
fill
the
wicked
beast
s
stomach
with
them
while
he
is
then
the
seven
kids
dragged
the
stones
thither
with
all
speed
and
put
as
many
of
them
into
his
stomach
as
they
could
get
in
and
the
mother
sewed
him
up
again
in
the
greatest
haste
so
that
he
was
not
aware
of
anything
and
never
once
stirred
when
the
wolf
had
had
his
sleep
out
he
got
on
his
legs
and
as
the
stones
in
his
stomach
made
him
very
thirsty
he
wanted
to
go
to
a
well
to
drink
but
when
he
began
to
walk
and
to
move
about
the
stones
in
his
stomach
knocked
against
each
other
and
rattled
then
cried
he
rumbles
and
tumbles
against
my
poor
bones
i
thought
twas
six
kids
but
it
s
only
big
stones
and
when
he
got
to
the
well
and
stooped
over
the
water
and
was
just
about
to
drink
the
heavy
stones
made
him
fall
in
there
was
no
help
for
it
but
he
had
to
drown
miserably
when
the
seven
kids
saw
that
they
came
running
to
the
spot
and
cried
aloud
the
wolf
is
dead
the
wolf
is
dead
and
danced
for
joy
round
about
the
well
with
their
mother
illustration
rapunzel
there
was
once
a
man
and
a
woman
who
had
long
in
vain
wished
for
a
child
at
length
the
woman
hoped
that
god
was
about
to
grant
her
desire
these
people
had
a
little
window
at
the
back
of
their
house
from
which
a
splendid
garden
could
be
seen
it
was
full
of
the
most
beautiful
flowers
and
herbs
it
was
however
surrounded
by
a
high
wall
and
no
one
dared
to
go
into
it
because
it
belonged
to
a
witch
who
had
great
power
and
was
dreaded
by
all
the
world
one
day
the
woman
was
standing
by
this
window
and
looking
down
into
the
garden
when
she
saw
a
bed
which
was
planted
with
the
most
beautiful
rampion
rapunzel
and
it
looked
so
fresh
and
green
that
she
longed
for
it
and
had
the
greatest
desire
to
eat
some
this
desire
increased
every
day
and
as
she
knew
that
she
could
not
get
any
of
it
she
quite
pined
away
and
looked
pale
and
miserable
then
her
husband
was
alarmed
and
asked
what
ails
you
dear
wife
ah
she
replied
if
i
can
t
get
some
of
the
rampion
to
eat
which
is
in
the
garden
behind
our
house
i
shall
the
man
who
loved
her
thought
sooner
than
let
your
wife
die
bring
her
some
of
the
rampion
yourself
let
it
cost
you
what
it
will
in
the
twilight
of
evening
he
clambered
over
the
wall
into
the
garden
of
the
witch
hastily
clutched
a
handful
of
rampion
and
took
it
to
his
wife
she
at
once
made
herself
a
salad
of
it
and
ate
it
with
much
relish
she
however
liked
it
so
much
so
very
much
that
the
next
day
she
longed
for
it
three
times
as
much
as
before
if
he
was
to
have
any
rest
her
husband
must
once
more
descend
into
the
garden
in
the
gloom
of
evening
therefore
he
let
himself
down
again
but
when
he
had
clambered
down
the
wall
he
was
terribly
afraid
for
he
saw
the
witch
standing
before
him
how
dare
you
said
she
with
angry
look
descend
into
my
garden
and
steal
my
rampion
like
a
thief
you
shall
suffer
for
it
ah
answered
he
let
mercy
take
the
place
of
justice
i
had
to
do
it
out
of
necessity
my
wife
saw
your
rampion
from
the
window
and
felt
such
a
longing
for
it
that
she
would
have
died
if
she
had
not
got
some
to
then
the
witch
let
her
anger
be
softened
and
said
to
him
if
the
case
be
as
you
say
i
will
allow
you
to
take
away
with
you
as
much
rampion
as
you
will
only
i
make
one
condition
you
must
give
me
the
child
which
your
wife
will
bring
into
the
world
it
shall
be
well
treated
and
i
will
care
for
it
like
a
the
man
in
his
terror
consented
to
everything
and
when
the
woman
at
last
had
a
little
daughter
the
witch
appeared
at
once
gave
the
child
the
name
of
rapunzel
and
took
it
away
with
her
rapunzel
grew
into
the
most
beautiful
child
beneath
the
sun
when
she
was
twelve
years
old
the
witch
shut
her
into
a
tower
which
lay
in
a
forest
and
had
neither
stairs
nor
door
but
quite
at
the
top
was
a
little
window
when
the
witch
wanted
to
go
in
she
placed
herself
beneath
this
and
cried
rapunzel
let
down
thy
rapunzel
had
magnificent
long
hair
fine
as
spun
gold
and
when
she
heard
the
voice
of
the
witch
she
unfastened
her
braided
tresses
and
wound
them
round
one
of
the
hooks
of
the
window
above
and
then
the
hair
fell
twenty
ells
down
and
the
witch
climbed
up
by
it
after
a
year
or
two
it
came
to
pass
that
the
king
s
son
rode
through
the
forest
and
went
by
the
tower
then
he
heard
a
song
which
was
so
charming
that
he
stood
still
and
listened
this
was
rapunzel
who
in
her
solitude
passed
her
time
in
letting
her
sweet
voice
resound
the
king
s
son
wanted
to
climb
up
to
her
and
looked
for
the
door
of
the
tower
but
none
was
to
be
found
he
rode
home
but
the
singing
had
so
deeply
touched
his
heart
that
every
day
he
went
out
into
the
forest
and
listened
to
it
once
when
he
was
thus
standing
behind
a
tree
he
saw
that
a
witch
came
there
and
he
heard
how
she
cried
rapunzel
let
down
thy
then
rapunzel
let
down
the
braids
of
her
hair
and
the
witch
climbed
up
to
her
if
that
is
the
ladder
by
which
one
mounts
i
will
for
once
try
my
fortune
said
he
the
next
day
when
it
began
to
grow
dark
he
went
to
the
tower
and
cried
rapunzel
let
down
thy
immediately
the
hair
fell
down
and
the
king
s
son
climbed
up
at
first
rapunzel
was
terribly
frightened
when
a
man
such
as
her
eyes
had
never
yet
beheld
came
to
her
but
the
king
s
son
began
to
talk
to
her
quite
like
a
friend
and
told
her
that
his
heart
had
been
so
stirred
that
it
had
let
him
have
no
rest
so
he
had
been
forced
to
see
her
then
rapunzel
lost
her
fear
and
when
he
asked
her
if
she
would
take
him
for
her
husband
and
she
saw
that
he
was
young
and
handsome
she
thought
he
will
love
me
more
than
old
dame
gothel
does
and
she
said
yes
and
laid
her
hand
in
his
she
said
also
i
will
willingly
go
away
with
you
but
i
do
not
know
how
to
get
down
bring
with
you
a
skein
of
silk
every
time
that
you
come
and
i
will
weave
a
ladder
with
it
when
that
is
ready
i
will
descend
and
you
will
take
me
on
your
they
agreed
that
until
that
time
he
should
come
to
her
every
evening
for
the
old
woman
came
by
day
the
witch
remarked
nothing
of
this
until
once
rapunzel
said
to
her
tell
me
dame
gothel
how
it
happens
that
you
are
so
much
heavier
for
me
to
draw
up
than
the
young
king
s
son
he
is
with
me
in
a
ah
you
wicked
child
cried
the
witch
what
do
i
hear
you
say
i
thought
i
had
separated
you
from
all
the
world
and
yet
you
have
deceived
me
in
her
anger
she
clutched
rapunzel
s
beautiful
tresses
wrapped
them
twice
round
her
left
hand
seized
a
pair
of
scissors
with
the
right
and
snap
they
were
cut
off
and
the
lovely
braids
lay
on
the
ground
and
she
was
so
pitiless
that
she
took
poor
rapunzel
into
a
desert
where
she
had
to
live
in
great
grief
and
misery
on
the
same
day
however
that
she
cast
out
rapunzel
the
witch
in
the
evening
fastened
the
braids
of
hair
which
she
had
cut
off
to
the
hook
of
the
window
and
when
the
king
s
son
came
and
cried
rapunzel
let
down
thy
hair
she
let
the
hair
down
the
king
s
son
ascended
he
did
not
find
his
dearest
rapunzel
above
but
the
witch
who
gazed
at
him
with
wicked
and
venomous
looks
aha
she
cried
mockingly
you
would
fetch
your
dearest
but
the
beautiful
bird
sits
no
longer
singing
in
the
nest
the
cat
has
got
it
and
will
scratch
out
your
eyes
as
well
rapunzel
is
lost
to
you
you
will
never
see
her
more
the
king
s
son
was
beside
himself
with
grief
and
in
his
despair
he
leapt
down
from
the
tower
he
escaped
with
his
life
but
the
thorns
into
which
he
fell
pierced
his
eyes
then
he
wandered
quite
blind
about
the
forest
ate
nothing
but
roots
and
berries
and
did
nothing
but
lament
and
weep
over
the
loss
of
his
dearest
wife
thus
he
roamed
about
in
misery
for
some
years
and
at
length
came
to
the
desert
where
rapunzel
lived
in
wretchedness
he
heard
a
voice
and
it
seemed
so
familiar
to
him
that
he
went
toward
it
when
he
approached
rapunzel
knew
him
and
fell
on
his
neck
and
wept
two
of
her
tears
wetted
his
eyes
and
they
grew
clear
again
and
he
could
see
with
them
as
before
he
led
her
to
his
kingdom
where
he
was
joyfully
received
and
they
lived
for
a
long
time
happy
and
contented
illustration
little
brother
and
little
sister
little
brother
took
his
little
sister
by
the
hand
and
said
since
our
mother
died
we
have
had
no
happiness
our
stepmother
beats
us
every
day
and
if
we
come
near
her
she
kicks
us
away
with
her
foot
our
meals
are
the
hard
crusts
of
bread
that
are
left
over
the
little
dog
under
the
table
is
better
off
for
she
often
throws
it
a
nice
bit
may
heaven
pity
us
if
our
mother
only
knew
come
we
will
go
forth
together
into
the
wide
they
walked
the
whole
day
over
meadows
fields
and
stony
places
and
when
it
rained
the
little
sister
said
heaven
and
our
hearts
are
weeping
in
the
evening
they
came
to
a
large
forest
and
they
were
so
weary
with
sorrow
and
hunger
and
the
long
walk
that
they
lay
down
in
a
hollow
tree
and
fell
asleep
the
next
day
when
they
awoke
the
sun
was
already
high
and
shone
down
hot
into
the
tree
then
the
little
brother
said
little
sister
i
am
thirsty
if
i
knew
of
a
little
brook
i
would
go
and
take
a
drink
i
think
i
hear
one
the
little
brother
got
up
and
took
the
little
sister
by
the
hand
and
they
set
off
to
find
the
brook
but
the
wicked
stepmother
was
a
witch
and
had
seen
how
the
two
children
had
gone
away
she
had
crept
after
them
as
witches
do
creep
and
had
bewitched
all
the
brooks
in
the
forest
now
when
they
found
a
little
brook
leaping
brightly
over
the
stones
the
little
brother
was
going
to
drink
out
of
it
but
the
little
sister
heard
how
it
said
as
it
ran
drinks
of
me
a
tiger
be
who
drinks
of
me
a
tiger
be
then
the
little
sister
cried
pray
dear
little
brother
do
not
drink
or
you
will
become
a
wild
beast
and
tear
me
to
the
little
brother
did
not
drink
although
he
was
so
thirsty
but
said
i
will
wait
for
the
next
when
they
came
to
the
next
brook
the
little
sister
heard
this
say
drinks
of
me
a
wild
wolf
be
who
drinks
of
me
a
wild
wolf
be
then
the
little
sister
cried
out
pray

little
brother
do

or
you
will
become
a
wolf
and
devour
the
little
brother
did
not
drink
and
said
i
will
wait
until
we
come
to
the
next
spring
but
then
i
must
drink
say
what
you
like
for
my
thirst
is
too
and
when
they
came
to
the
third
brook
the
little
sister
heard
how
it
said
as
it
ran
drinks
of
me
a
roebuck
be
who
drinks
of
me

the
little
sister
said
oh

little
brother

or
you
will
become
a
roe
and
run
away
from
but
the
little
brother
had
knelt
by
the
brook
and
had
bent
down
and
drunk
some
of
the
water
and
as
soon
as
the
first
drops
touched
his
lips
he
lay
there
a
young
roe
and
now
the
little
sister
wept
over
her
poor
bewitched
little
brother
and
the
little
roe
wept
also
and
sat
sorrowfully
near
to
her
but
at
last
the
girl
said
be
quiet
dear
little
roe
i
will
never
never
leave
then
she
untied
her
golden
garter
and
put
it
round
the
roe
s
neck
and
she
plucked
rushes
and
wove
them
into
a
soft
cord
with
this
she
tied
the
little
animal
and
led
it
on
and
she
walked
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
forest
and
when
they
had
gone
a
very
long
way
they
came
to
a
little
house
the
girl
looked
in
and
as
it
was
empty
she
thought
we
can
stay
here
and
then
she
sought
for
leaves
and
moss
to
make
a
soft
bed
for
the
roe
every
morning
she
went
out
and
gathered
roots
and
berries
and
nuts
for
herself
and
brought
tender
grass
for
the
roe
who
ate
out
of
her
hand
and
was
content
and
played
round
about
her
in
the
evening
when
the
little
sister
was
tired
and
had
said
her
prayer
she
laid
her
head
upon
the
roe
s
back
that
was
her
pillow
and
she
slept
softly
on
it
and
if
only
the
little
brother
had
had
his
human
form
it
would
have
been
a
delightful
life
for
some
time
they
were
alone
like
this
in
the
wilderness
but
it
happened
that
the
king
of
the
country
held
a
great
hunt
in
the
forest
then
the
blasts
of
the
horns
the
barking
of
dogs
and
the
merry
shouts
of
the
huntsmen
rang
through
the
trees
and
the
roe
heard
all
and
was
only
too
anxious
to
be
there
oh
said
he
to
his
little
sister
let
me
be
off
to
the
hunt
i
can
not
bear
it
any
longer
and
he
begged
so
much
that
at
last
she
agreed
but
said
she
to
him
come
back
to
me
in
the
evening
i
must
shut
my
door
for
fear
of
the
rough
huntsmen
so
knock
and
say
my
little
sister
let
me
in
that
i
may
know
you
and
if
you
do
not
say
that
i
shall
not
open
the
then
the
young
roe
sprang
away
so
happy
was
he
and
so
merry
in
the
open
air
the
king
and
the
huntsmen
saw
the
pretty
creature
and
started
after
him
but
they
could
not
catch
him
and
when
they
thought
that
they
surely
had
him
away
he
sprang
through
the
bushes
and
was
gone
when
it
was
dark
he
ran
to
the
cottage
knocked
and
said
my
little
sister
let
me
then
the
door
was
opened
for
him
and
he
jumped
in
and
rested
himself
the
whole
night
through
upon
his
soft
bed
the
next
day
the
hunt
went
on
afresh
and
when
the
roe
again
heard
the
and
the
ho
of
the
huntsmen
he
had
no
peace
but
said
sister
let
me
out
i
must
be
his
sister
opened
the
door
for
him
and
said
but
you
must
be
here
again
in
the
evening
and
say
your
when
the
king
and
his
huntsmen
again
saw
the
young
roe
with
the
golden
collar
they
all
chased
him
but
he
was
too
quick
and
nimble
for
them
this
went
on
for
the
whole
day
but
by
evening
the
huntsmen
had
surrounded
him
and
one
of
them
wounded
him
a
little
in
the
foot
so
that
he
limped
and
ran
slowly
then
a
hunter
crept
after
him
to
the
cottage
and
heard
how
he
said
my
little
sister
let
me
in
and
saw
that
the
door
was
opened
for
him
and
was
shut
again
at
once
the
huntsman
took
notice
of
it
all
and
went
to
the
king
and
told
him
what
he
had
seen
and
heard
then
the
king
said
we
will
hunt
once
the
little
sister
however
was
dreadfully
frightened
when
she
saw
that
her
little
roe
was
hurt
she
washed
the
blood
off
him
laid
herbs
on
the
wound
and
said
go
to
your
bed
dear
roe
that
you
may
get
well
but
the
wound
was
so
slight
that
the
roe
next
morning
did
not
feel
it
any
more
and
when
he
again
heard
the
sport
outside
he
said
i
can
not
bear
it
i
must
be
there
they
shall
not
find
it
so
easy
to
catch
me
the
little
sister
cried
and
said
this
time
they
will
kill
you
and
here
am
i
alone
in
the
forest
and
forsaken
by
all
the
world
i
will
not
let
you
then
you
will
have
me
die
of
grief
answered
the
roe
when
i
hear
the
i
feel
as
if
i
must
jump
out
of
my
then
the
little
sister
could
not
do
otherwise
but
opened
the
door
for
him
with
a
heavy
heart
and
the
roe
full
of
health
and
joy
bounded
away
into
the
forest
when
the
king
saw
him
he
said
to
his
huntsman
now
chase
him
all
day
long
till
nightfall
but
take
care
that
no
one
does
him
any
as
soon
as
the
sun
had
set
the
king
said
to
the
huntsmen
now
come
and
show
me
the
cottage
in
the
wood
and
when
he
was
at
the
door
he
knocked
and
called
out
dear
little
sister
let
me
then
the
door
opened
and
the
king
walked
in
and
there
stood
a
maiden
more
lovely
than
any
he
had
ever
seen
the
maiden
was
frightened
when
she
saw
not
her
little
roe
but
a
man
with
a
golden
crown
upon
his
head
but
the
king
looked
kindly
at
her
stretched
out
his
hand
and
said
will
you
go
with
me
to
my
palace
and
be
my
dear
wife
illustration
the
king
said
will
you
be
my
dear
wife
yes
indeed
answered
the
maiden
but
the
little
roe
must
go
with
me
i
can
not
leave
the
king
said
he
shall
stay
with
you
as
long
as
you
live
and
shall
want
just
then
he
came
running
in
and
the
little
sister
again
tied
him
with
the
cord
of
rushes
took
it
in
her
own
hand
and
went
away
with
the
king
from
the
cottage
the
king
took
the
lovely
maiden
upon
his
horse
and
carried
her
to
his
palace
where
the
wedding
was
held
with
great
pomp
she
was
now
the
queen
and
they
lived
for
a
long
time
happily
together
the
roe
was
tended
and
cherished
and
ran
about
in
the
but
the
wicked
witch
because
of
whom
the
children
had
gone
out
into
the
world
thought
all
the
time
that
the
little
sister
had
been
torn
to
pieces
by
the
wild
beasts
in
the
wood
and
that
the
little
brother
had
been
shot
for
a
roe
by
the
huntsmen
now
when
she
heard
that
they
were
so
happy
and
so
well
off
envy
and
hatred
rose
in
her
heart
and
left
her
no
peace
and
she
thought
of
nothing
but
how
she
could
bring
them
again
to
misfortune
her
own
daughter
who
was
as
ugly
as
night
and
had
only
one
eye
grumbled
at
her
and
said
a
queen
that
ought
to
have
been
my
only
be
quiet
answered
the
old
woman
and
comforted
her
by
saying
when
the
time
comes
i
shall
be
as
time
went
on
the
queen
had
a
pretty
little
boy
it
happened
that
the
king
was
out
hunting
so
the
old
witch
took
the
form
of
the
chambermaid
went
into
the
room
where
the
queen
lay
and
said
to
her
come
the
bath
is
ready
it
will
do
you
good
and
give
you
fresh
strength
make
haste
before
it
gets
the
daughter
also
was
close
by
so
they
carried
the
weak
queen
into
the
bathroom
and
put
her
into
the
bath
then
they
shut
the
door
and
ran
away
but
in
the
bathroom
they
had
made
a
fire
of
such
deadly
heat
that
the
beautiful
young
queen
was
soon
suffocated
when
this
was
done
the
old
woman
took
her
daughter
put
a
nightcap
on
her
head
and
laid
her
in
bed
in
place
of
the
queen
she
gave
her
too
the
shape
and
the
look
of
the
queen
only
she
could
not
make
good
the
lost
eye
but
in
order
that
the
king
might
not
see
it
she
was
to
lie
on
the
side
on
which
she
had
no
eye
in
the
evening
when
he
came
home
and
heard
that
he
had
a
son
he
was
heartily
glad
and
was
going
to
the
bed
of
his
dear
wife
to
see
how
she
was
but
the
old
woman
quickly
called
out
for
your
life
leave
the
curtains
closed
the
queen
ought
not
to
see
the
light
yet
and
must
have
the
king
went
away
and
did
not
find
out
that
a
false
queen
was
lying
in
the
bed
but
at
midnight
when
all
slept
the
nurse
who
was
sitting
in
the
nursery
by
the
cradle
and
who
was
the
only
person
awake
saw
the
door
open
and
the
true
queen
walk
in
she
took
the
child
out
of
the
cradle
laid
it
on
her
arm
and
nursed
it
then
she
shook
up
its
pillow
laid
the
child
down
again
and
covered
it
with
the
little
quilt
and
she
did
not
forget
the
roe
but
went
into
the
corner
where
he
lay
and
stroked
his
back
then
she
went
quite
silently
out
of
the
door
again
the
next
morning
the
nurse
asked
the
guards
whether
any
one
had
come
into
the
palace
during
the
night
but
they
answered
no
we
have
seen
no
she
came
thus
many
nights
and
never
spoke
a
word
the
nurse
always
saw
her
but
she
did
not
dare
to
tell
any
one
about
it
when
some
time
had
passed
in
this
manner
the
queen
began
to
speak
in
the
night
and
said
fares
my
child
how
fares
my
roe
twice
shall
i
come
then
never
moe
the
nurse
did
not
answer
but
when
the
queen
had
gone
again
went
to
the
king
and
told
him
all
the
king
said
ah
heavens
what
is
this
night
i
will
watch
by
the
in
the
evening
he
went
into
the
nursery
and
at
midnight
the
queen
again
appeared
and
said
fares
my
child
how
fares
my
roe
once
shall
i
come
then
never
moe
and
she
nursed
the
child
as
she
was
wont
to
do
before
she
disappeared
the
king
dared
not
speak
to
her
but
on
the
next
night
he
watched
again
then
she
said
fares
my
child
how
fares
my
roe
this
time
i
come
then
never
moe
at
that
the
king
could
not
restrain
himself
he
sprang
toward
her
and
said
you
can
be
none
other
than
my
dear
she
answered
yes
i
am
your
dear
wife
and
at
the
same
moment
she
received
life
again
and
by
god
s
grace
became
fresh
rosy
and
full
of
health
then
she
told
the
king
the
evil
deed
which
the
wicked
witch
and
her
daughter
had
been
guilty
of
toward
her
the
king
ordered
both
to
be
led
before
the
judge
and
judgment
was
delivered
against
them
the
daughter
was
taken
into
the
forest
where
she
was
torn
to
pieces
by
wild
beasts
but
the
witch
was
cast
into
the
fire
and
miserably
burnt
and
as
soon
as
she
was
burnt
the
roe
changed
his
shape
and
received
his
human
form
again
so
the
little
sister
and
little
brother
lived
happily
together
all
their
lives
illustration
the
there
was
once
on
a
time
a
little
girl
whose
father
and
mother
were
dead
she
was
so
poor
that
she
no
longer
had
any
little
room
to
live
in
or
bed
to
sleep
in
at
last
she
had
nothing
else
but
the
clothes
she
was
wearing
and
a
little
bit
of
bread
in
her
hand
which
some
charitable
soul
had
given
her
she
was
however
good
and
pious
and
as
she
was
thus
forsaken
by
all
the
world
she
went
forth
into
the
open
country
trusting
in
the
good
god
then
a
poor
man
met
her
who
said
ah
give
me
something
to
eat
i
am
so
hungry
she
reached
him
the
whole
of
her
piece
of
bread
and
said
may
god
bless
it
to
your
use
and
went
onward
then
came
a
child
who
moaned
and
said
my
head
is
so
cold
give
me
something
to
cover
it
so
she
took
off
her
hood
and
gave
it
to
him
and
when
she
had
walked
a
little
farther
she
met
another
child
who
had
no
jacket
and
was
frozen
with
cold
then
she
gave
it
her
own
a
little
farther
on
one
begged
for
a
frock
and
she
gave
away
that
also
at
length
she
got
into
a
forest
and
it
had
already
become
dark
and
there
came
yet
another
child
and
asked
for
a
little
shirt
the
good
little
girl
thought
to
herself
it
is
a
dark
night
and
no
one
sees
me
i
can
very
well
give
my
little
shirt
away
and
took
it
off
and
gave
away
that
also
and
she
so
stood
and
had
not
one
single
thing
left
then
suddenly
some
stars
from
heaven
fell
down
and
they
were
nothing
else
but
hard
smooth
pieces
of
money
and
although
she
had
just
given
her
little
shirt
away
lo
she
had
a
new
one
which
was
of
the
very
finest
linen
then
she
gathered
together
the
money
into
this
and
was
rich
all
the
days
of
her
life
illustration
the
fisherman
and
his
wife
there
was
once
on
a
time
a
fisherman
who
lived
with
his
wife
in
a
miserable
hovel
close
by
the
sea
and
every
day
he
went
out
fishing
and
once
as
he
was
sitting
with
his
rod
looking
at
the
clear
water
his
line
suddenly
went
down
far
down
below
and
when
he
drew
it
up
again
he
brought
out
a
large
flounder
then
the
flounder
said
to
him
hark
you
fisherman
i
pray
you
let
me
live
i
am
no
flounder
really
but
an
enchanted
prince
what
good
will
it
do
you
to
kill
me
i
should
not
be
good
to
eat
put
me
in
the
water
again
and
let
me
come
said
the
fisherman
there
is
no
need
for
so
many
words
about
it
a
fish
that
can
talk
i
should
certainly
let
go
with
that
he
put
him
back
again
into
the
clear
water
and
the
flounder
went
to
the
bottom
leaving
a
long
streak
of
blood
behind
him
then
the
fisherman
got
up
and
went
home
to
his
wife
in
the
hovel
husband
said
the
woman
have
you
caught
nothing
no
said
the
man
i
did
catch
a
flounder
who
said
he
was
an
enchanted
prince
so
i
let
him
go
did
you
not
wish
for
anything
first
said
the
woman
no
said
the
man
what
should
i
wish
for
ah
said
the
woman
it
is
surely
hard
to
have
to
live
always
in
this
dirty
hovel
you
might
have
wished
for
a
small
cottage
for
us
go
back
and
call
him
tell
him
we
want
to
have
a
small
cottage
he
will
certainly
give
us
ah
said
the
man
why
should
i
go
there
again
why
said
the
woman
you
did
catch
him
and
you
let
him
go
again
he
is
sure
to
do
it
go
at
the
man
still
did
not
quite
like
to
go
but
did
not
want
to
oppose
his
wife
and
went
to
the
sea
when
he
got
there
the
sea
was
all
green
and
yellow
and
no
longer
smooth
so
he
stood
and
said
flounder
in
the
sea
come
i
pray
thee
here
to
me
for
my
wife
dame
ilsabil
wills
not
as
i
d
have
her
then
the
flounder
came
swimming
to
him
and
said
well
what
does
she
want
then
ah
said
the
man
i
did
catch
you
and
my
wife
says
i
really
ought
to
have
wished
for
something
she
does
not
like
to
live
in
a
wretched
hovel
any
longer
she
would
like
to
have
a
go
then
said
the
flounder
she
has
it
when
the
man
got
home
his
wife
was
no
longer
in
the
hovel
but
instead
of
it
there
stood
a
small
cottage
and
she
was
sitting
on
a
bench
before
the
door
then
she
took
him
by
the
hand
and
said
to
him
just
come
inside
look
now
isn
t
this
a
great
deal
better
so
they
went
in
and
there
was
a
small
porch
and
a
pretty
little
parlor
and
bedroom
and
a
kitchen
and
pantry
with
the
best
of
furniture
and
fitted
up
with
the
most
beautiful
things
made
of
tin
and
brass
whatsoever
was
wanted
and
behind
the
cottage
there
was
a
small
yard
with
hens
and
ducks
and
a
little
garden
with
flowers
and
fruit
look
said
the
wife
is
not
that
nice
yes
said
the
husband
and
so
we
must
always
think
it
now
we
will
live
quite
we
will
think
about
that
said
the
wife
with
that
they
ate
something
and
went
to
bed
everything
went
well
for
a
week
or
a
fortnight
and
then
the
woman
said
hark
you
husband
this
cottage
is
far
too
small
for
us
and
the
garden
and
yard
are
little
the
flounder
might
just
as
well
have
given
us
a
larger
house
i
should
like
to
live
in
a
great
stone
castle
go
to
the
flounder
and
tell
him
to
give
us
a
ah
wife
said
the
man
the
cottage
is
quite
good
enough
why
should
we
live
in
a
castle
what
said
the
woman
go
at
once
the
flounder
can
always
do
no
wife
said
the
man
the
flounder
has
just
given
us
the
cottage
i
do
not
like
to
go
back
so
soon
it
might
make
him
go
said
the
woman
he
can
do
it
quite
easily
and
will
be
glad
to
do
it
just
you
go
to
the
man
s
heart
grew
heavy
and
he
did
not
wish
to
go
he
said
to
himself
it
is
not
right
and
yet
he
went
and
when
he
came
to
the
sea
the
water
was
quite
purple
and
and
gray
and
thick
and
no
longer
green
and
yellow
but
it
was
still
quiet
and
he
stood
there
and
said
flounder
in
the
sea
come
i
pray
thee
here
to
me
for
my
wife
dame
ilsabil
wills
not
as
i
d
have
her
well
what
does
she
want
now
said
the
flounder
alas
said
the
man
half
scared
she
wants
to
live
in
a
great
stone
go
to
it
then
she
is
standing
before
the
door
said
the
flounder
then
the
man
went
home
and
when
he
got
there
he
found
a
great
stone
palace
and
his
wife
was
just
standing
on
the
steps
going
in
she
took
him
by
the
hand
and
said
come
so
he
went
with
her
and
in
the
castle
was
a
great
hall
paved
with
marble
and
many
servants
who
flung
wide
the
doors
the
walls
were
all
bright
with
beautiful
hangings
and
in
the
rooms
were
chairs
and
tables
of
pure
gold
crystal
chandeliers
hung
from
the
ceiling
and
all
the
rooms
and
bedrooms
had
carpets
food
and
wine
of
the
very
best
were
standing
on
all
the
tables
so
that
they
nearly
broke
down
beneath
it
behind
the
house
too
there
was
a
great
courtyard
with
stables
for
horses
and
cows
and
the
very
best
of
carriages
there
was
a
magnificent
large
garden
too
with
the
most
beautiful
flowers
and
and
a
park
quite
half
a
mile
long
in
which
were
stags
deer
and
hares
and
everything
that
could
be
desired
come
said
the
woman
isn
t
that
beautiful
yes
indeed
said
the
man
now
let
it
be
and
we
will
live
in
this
beautiful
castle
and
be
we
will
consider
about
that
said
the
woman
and
sleep
upon
it
thereupon
they
went
to
bed
next
morning
the
wife
awoke
first
it
was
just
daybreak
and
from
her
bed
she
saw
the
beautiful
country
lying
before
her
her
husband
was
still
stretching
himself
so
she
poked
him
in
the
side
with
her
elbow
and
said
get
up
husband
and
just
peep
out
of
the
window
look
you
couldn
t
we
be
the
king
over
all
that
land
go
to
the
flounder
we
will
be
the
ah
wife
said
the
man
why
should
we
be
king
i
do
not
want
to
be
well
said
the
wife
if
you
won
t
be
king
i
will
go
to
the
flounder
for
i
will
be
ah
wife
said
the
man
why
do
you
want
to
be
king
i
do
not
like
to
say
that
to
why
not
said
the
woman
go
to
him
at
once
i
must
be
king
so
the
man
went
and
was
quite
unhappy
because
his
wife
wished
to
be
king
it
is
not
right
it
is
not
right
thought
he
he
did
not
wish
to
go
but
yet
he
went
and
when
he
came
to
the
sea
it
was
quite
and
the
water
heaved
up
from
below
and
smelt
putrid
then
he
went
and
stood
by
it
and
said
flounder
in
the
sea
come
i
pray
thee
here
to
me
for
my
wife
dame
ilsabil
wills
not
as
i
d
have
her
well
what
does
she
want
now
said
the
flounder
alas
said
the
man
she
wants
to
be
go
to
her
she
is
king
so
the
man
went
and
when
he
came
to
the
palace
the
castle
had
become
much
larger
and
had
a
great
tower
and
magnificent
ornaments
the
sentinel
was
standing
before
the
door
and
there
were
numbers
of
soldiers
with
kettledrums
and
trumpets
and
when
he
went
inside
the
house
everything
was
of
real
marble
and
gold
with
velvet
covers
and
great
golden
tassels
then
the
doors
of
the
hall
were
opened
and
there
was
the
court
in
all
its
splendor
and
his
wife
was
sitting
on
a
high
throne
of
gold
and
diamonds
with
a
great
crown
of
gold
on
her
head
and
a
sceptre
of
pure
gold
and
jewels
in
her
hand
on
both
sides
of
her
stood
her
in
a
row
each
of
them
always
one
head
shorter
than
the
last
then
he
went
and
stood
before
her
and
said
ah
wife
and
now
you
are
yes
said
the
woman
now
i
am
so
he
stood
and
looked
at
her
and
when
he
had
looked
at
her
thus
for
some
time
he
said
and
now
that
you
are
king
let
all
else
be
we
will
wish
for
nothing
nay
husband
said
the
woman
quite
anxiously
i
find
time
pass
very
heavily
i
can
bear
it
no
longer
go
to
the
flounder
i
am
king
but
i
must
be
emperor
alas
wife
why
do
you
wish
to
be
emperor
husband
said
she
go
to
the
flounder
i
will
be
alas
wife
said
the
man
he
can
not
make
you
emperor
i
may
not
say
that
to
the
fish
there
is
only
one
emperor
in
the
land
an
emperor
the
flounder
can
not
make
you
i
assure
you
he

said
the
woman
i

the
king
and

but

this
moment
go
at
once
if
he
can
make
a
king

can
make
an
emperor
i
will
be
emperor
go
so
he
was
forced
to
go
as
the
man
went
however
he
was
troubled
in
mind
and
thought
to
himself
it
will
not
end
well
it
will
not
end
well
emperor
is
too
shameless
the
flounder
will
at
last
be
tired
with
that
he
reached
the
sea
and
the
sea
was
quite
black
and
thick
and
began
to
boil
up
from
below
so
that
it
threw
up
bubbles
and
such
a
sharp
wind
blew
over
it
that
it
curdled
and
the
man
was
afraid
then
he
went
and
stood
by
it
and
said
flounder
in
the
sea
come
i
pray
thee
here
to
me
for
my
wife
dame
ilsabil
wills
not
as
i
d
have
her
well
what
does
she
want
now
said
the
flounder
alas
flounder
said
he
my
wife
wants
to
be
go
to
her
said
the
flounder
she
is
emperor
so
the
man
went
and
when
he
got
there
the
whole
palace
was
made
of
polished
marble
with
alabaster
figures
and
golden
ornaments
and
soldiers
were
marching
before
the
door
blowing
trumpets
and
beating
cymbals
and
drums
in
the
house
barons
and
counts
and
dukes
were
going
about
as
servants
then
they
opened
the
doors
to
him
which
were
of
pure
gold
and
when
he
entered
there
sat
his
wife
on
a
throne
which
was
made
of
one
piece
of
gold
and
was
quite
two
miles
high
and
she
wore
a
great
golden
crown
that
was
three
yards
high
and
set
with
diamonds
and
carbuncles
in
one
hand
she
had
the
sceptre
and
in
the
other
the
imperial
orb
and
on
both
sides
of
her
stood
the
yeomen
of
the
guard
in
two
rows
each
being
smaller
than
the
one
before
him
from
the
biggest
giant
who
was
two
miles
high
to
the
very
smallest
dwarf
just
as
big
as
my
little
finger
and
before
it
stood
a
number
of
princes
and
dukes
then
the
man
went
and
stood
among
than
and
said
wife
are
you
emperor
now
yes
said
she
now
i
am
then
he
stood
and
looked
at
her
well
and
when
he
had
looked
at
her
thus
for
some
time
he
said
ah
wife
be
content
now
that
you
are
husband
said
she
why
are
you
standing
there
now
i
am
emperor
but
i
will
be
pope
too
go
to
the
alas
wife
said
the
man
what
will
you
not
wish
for
you
can
not
be
pope
there
is
but
one
in
christendom
he
can
not
make
you
husband
said
she
i
will
be
pope
go
immediately
i
must
be
pope
this
very
illustration
yes
said
she
now
i
am
emperor
no
wife
said
the
man
i
do
not
like
to
say
that
to
him
that
would
not
do
it
is
too
much
the
flounder
can
t
make

said
she
what
nonsense
if
he
can
make
an
emperor
he
can
make
a
pope
go
to
him
directly
i
am
emperor
and
you
are
nothing
but
my
husband
will
you
go
at
once
then
he
was
afraid
and
went
but
he
was
quite
faint
and
shivered
and
shook
and
his
knees
and
legs
trembled
and
a
high
wind
blew
over
the
land
and
the
clouds
flew
and
toward
evening
all
grew
dark
and
the
leaves
fell
from
the
trees
and
the
water
rose
and
roared
as
if
it
were
boiling
and
splashed
upon
the
shore
in
the
distance
he
saw
ships
which
were
firing
guns
in
their
sore
need
pitching
and
tossing
on
the
waves
and
yet
in
the
midst
of
the
sky
there
was
still
a
small
bit
of
blue
though
on
every
side
it
was
as
red
as
in
a
heavy
storm
so
full
of
despair
he
went
and
stood
in
much
fear
and
said
flounder
in
the
sea
come
i
pray
thee
here
to
me
for
my
wife
dame
ilsabil
wills
not
as
i
d
have
her
well
what
does
she
want
now
said
the
flounder
alas
said
the
man
she
wants
to
be
go
to
her
then
said
the
flounder
she
is
pope
p
so
he
went
and
when
he
got
there
he
saw
what
seemed
to
be
a
large
church
surrounded
by
palaces
he
pushed
his
way
through
the
crowd
inside
however
everything
was
lighted
with
thousands
and
thousands
of
candles
and
his
wife
was
clad
in
gold
and
she
was
sitting
on
a
much
higher
throne
and
had
three
great
golden
crowns
on
and
round
about
her
there
was
much
churchly
splendor
and
on
both
sides
of
her
was
a
row
of
candles
the
largest
of
which
was
as
tall
as
the
very
tallest
tower
down
to
the
very
smallest
kitchen
candle
and
all
the
emperors
and
kings
were
on
their
knees
before
her
kissing
her
shoe
wife
said
the
man
and
looked
attentively
at
her
are
you
now
pope
yes
said
she
i
am
so
he
stood
and
looked
at
her
and
it
was
just
as
if
he
was
looking
at
the
bright
sun
when
he
had
stood
looking
at
her
thus
for
a
short
time
he
said
ah
wife
if
you
are
pope
do
let
well
alone
but
she
looked
as
stiff
as
a
post
and
did
not
move
or
show
any
signs
of
life
then
said
he
wife
now
that
you
are
pope
be
satisfied
you
can
not
become
anything
i
will
consider
about
that
said
the
woman
thereupon
they
both
went
to
bed
but
she
was
not
satisfied
and
greediness
let
her
have
no
sleep
for
she
was
continually
thinking
what
there
was
left
for
her
to
be
the
man
slept
well
and
soundly
for
he
had
run
about
a
great
deal
during
the
day
but
the
woman
could
not
fall
asleep
at
all
and
flung
herself
from
one
side
to
the
other
the
whole
night
through
thinking
what
more
was
left
for
her
to
be
but
unable
to
call
to
mind
anything
else
at
length
the
sun
began
to
rise
and
when
the
woman
saw
the
red
of
dawn
she
sat
up
in
bed
and
looked
at
it
and
when
through
the
window
she
saw
the
sun
thus
rising
she
said
can
not
i
too
order
the
sun
and
moon
to
rise
husband
said
she
poking
him
in
the
ribs
with
her
elbows
wake
up
go
to
the
flounder
for
i
wish
to
be
even
as
god
the
man
was
still
half
asleep
but
he
was
so
horrified
that
he
fell
out
of
bed
he
thought
he
must
have
heard
amiss
and
rubbed
his
eyes
and
said
alas
wife
what
are
you
saying
husband
said
she
if
i
can
t
order
the
sun
and
moon
to
rise
and
have
to
look
on
and
see
the
sun
and
moon
rising
i
can
t
bear
it
i
shall
not
know
what
it
is
to
have
another
happy
hour
unless
i
can
make
them
rise
then
she
looked
at
him
so
terribly
that
a
shudder
ran
over
him
and
said
go
at
once
i
wish
to
be
like
unto
alas
wife
said
the
man
falling
on
his
knees
before
her
the
flounder
can
not
do
that
he
can
make
an
emperor
and
a
pope
i
beseech
you
go
on
as
you
are
and
be
then
she
fell
into
a
rage
and
her
hair
flew
wildly
about
her
head
and
she
cried
i
will
not
endure
this
i
ll
not
bear
it
any
longer
will
you
go
then
he
put
on
his
trousers
and
ran
away
like
a
madman
but
outside
a
great
storm
was
raging
and
blowing
so
hard
that
he
could
scarcely
keep
his
feet
houses
and
trees
toppled
over
mountains
trembled
rocks
rolled
into
the
sea
the
sky
was
pitch
black
and
it
thundered
and
lightened
and
the
sea
came
in
with
black
waves
as
high
as
and
mountains
and
all
with
crests
of
white
foam
at
the
top
then
he
cried
but
could
not
hear
his
own
words
flounder
in
the
sea
come
i
pray
thee
here
to
me
for
my
wife
dame
ilsabil
wills
not
as
i
d
have
her
well
what
does
she
want
now
said
the
flounder
alas
said
he
she
wants
to
be
like
unto
go
to
her
and
you
will
find
her
back
again
in
the
dirty
and
there
they
are
living
at
this
very
time
illustration
the
white
snake
a
long
time
ago
there
lived
a
king
who
was
famed
for
his
wisdom
through
all
the
land
nothing
was
hidden
from
him
and
it
seemed
as
if
news
of
the
most
secret
things
was
brought
to
him
through
the
air
but
he
had
a
strange
custom
every
day
after
dinner
when
the
table
was
cleared
and
no
one
else
was
present
a
trusty
servant
had
to
bring
him
one
more
dish
it
was
covered
and
even
the
servant
did
not
know
what
was
in
it
neither
did
any
one
know
for
the
king
never
took
off
the
cover
to
eat
of
it
until
he
was
quite
alone
this
had
gone
on
for
a
long
time
when
one
day
the
servant
who
took
away
the
dish
was
overcome
with
such
curiosity
that
he
could
not
help
carrying
the
dish
into
his
room
when
he
had
carefully
locked
the
door
he
lifted
up
the
cover
and
saw
a
white
snake
lying
on
the
dish
but
when
he
saw
it
he
could
not
deny
himself
the
pleasure
of
tasting
it
so
he
cut
off
a
little
bit
and
put
it
into
his
mouth
no
sooner
had
it
touched
his
tongue
than
he
heard
a
strange
whispering
of
little
voices
outside
his
window
he
went
and
listened
and
then
noticed
that
it
was
the
sparrows
who
were
chattering
together
and
telling
one
another
of
all
kinds
of
things
which
they
had
seen
in
the
fields
and
woods
eating
the
snake
had
given
him
power
to
understand
the
language
of
animals
now
it
so
happened
that
on
this
very
day
the
queen
lost
her
most
beautiful
ring
and
suspicion
of
having
stolen
it
fell
upon
this
trusty
servant
who
was
allowed
to
go
everywhere
the
king
ordered
the
man
to
be
brought
before
him
and
threatened
with
angry
words
that
unless
he
could
before
the
morrow
point
out
the
thief
he
himself
should
be
looked
upon
as
guilty
and
should
be
executed
in
vain
he
declared
his
innocence
he
was
dismissed
with
no
better
answer
in
his
trouble
and
fear
he
went
down
into
the
courtyard
and
took
thought
how
to
help
himself
out
of
his
trouble
now
some
ducks
were
sitting
together
quietly
by
a
brook
and
taking
their
rest
and
whilst
they
were
making
their
feathers
smooth
with
their
bills
they
were
having
a
confidential
conversation
the
servant
stood
by
and
listened
they
were
telling
one
another
of
all
the
places
where
they
had
been
waddling
about
all
the
morning
and
what
good
food
they
had
found
and
one
said
in
a
pitiful
tone
something
lies
heavy
on
my
stomach
as
i
was
eating
in
haste
i
swallowed
a
ring
which
lay
under
the
queen
s
the
servant
at
once
seized
her
by
the
neck
carried
her
to
the
kitchen
and
said
to
the
cook
here
is
a
fine
duck
pray
kill
yes
said
the
cook
and
weighed
her
in
his
hand
she
has
spared
no
trouble
to
fatten
herself
and
has
been
waiting
long
enough
to
be
so
he
cut
off
her
head
and
as
she
was
being
dressed
for
the
spit
the
queen
s
ring
was
found
inside
her
the
servant
could
now
easily
prove
his
innocence
the
king
to
make
amends
for
the
wrong
allowed
him
to
ask
a
favor
and
promised
him
the
best
place
in
the
court
the
servant
refused
everything
and
asked
only
for
a
horse
and
some
money
for
traveling
as
he
had
a
mind
to
see
the
world
and
go
about
a
little
when
his
request
was
granted
he
set
out
on
his
way
one
day
he
came
to
a
pond
where
he
saw
three
fishes
caught
in
the
reeds
and
gasping
for
water
now
though
it
is
said
that
fishes
are
dumb
he
heard
them
lamenting
that
they
must
perish
so
miserably
as
he
had
a
kind
heart
he
got
off
his
horse
and
put
the
three
prisoners
back
into
the
water
they
quivered
with
delight
put
out
their
heads
and
cried
to
him
we
will
remember
you
and
repay
you
for
saving
us
he
rode
on
and
after
a
while
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
heard
a
voice
in
the
sand
at
his
feet
he
listened
and
heard
an
complain
why
can
not
folk
with
their
clumsy
beasts
keep
off
our
bodies
that
stupid
horse
with
his
heavy
hoofs
has
been
treading
down
my
people
without
mercy
so
he
turned
on
to
a
side
path
and
the
cried
out
to
him
we
will
remember
you
good
turn
deserves
another
the
path
led
him
into
a
wood
and
there
he
saw
two
old
ravens
standing
by
their
nest
and
throwing
out
their
young
ones
out
with
you
you
idle
creatures
cried
they
we
can
not
find
food
for
you
any
longer
you
are
big
enough
and
can
provide
for
but
the
poor
young
ravens
lay
upon
the
ground
flapping
their
wings
and
crying
oh
what
helpless
chicks
we
are
we
must
shift
for
ourselves
and
yet
we
can
not
fly
what
can
we
do
but
lie
here
and
starve
so
the
good
young
fellow
alighted
and
killed
his
horse
with
his
sword
and
gave
it
to
them
for
food
then
they
came
hopping
up
to
it
satisfied
their
hunger
and
cried
we
will
remember
you
one
good
turn
deserves
another
and
now
he
had
to
use
his
own
legs
and
when
he
had
walked
a
long
way
he
came
to
a
large
city
there
was
a
great
noise
and
crowd
in
the
streets
and
a
man
rode
up
on
horseback
crying
aloud
the
king
s
daughter
wants
a
husband
but
whoever
sues
for
her
hand
must
perform
a
hard
task
if
he
does
not
succeed
he
will
forfeit
his
many
had
already
made
the
attempt
but
in
vain
nevertheless
when
the
youth
saw
the
king
s
daughter
he
was
so
overcome
by
her
great
beauty
that
he
forgot
all
danger
went
before
the
king
and
declared
himself
a
suitor
so
he
was
led
out
to
the
sea
and
a
gold
ring
was
cast
into
it
then
the
king
ordered
him
to
fetch
this
ring
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
added
if
you
come
up
without
it
you
will
be
thrown
in
again
and
again
until
you
perish
amid
the
all
the
people
grieved
for
the
handsome
youth
then
they
went
away
leaving
him
alone
by
the
sea
illustration
there
lay
the
gold
ring
in
the
shell
he
stood
on
the
shore
and
considered
what
he
should
do
when
suddenly
he
saw
three
fishes
come
swimming
toward
him
they
were
the
very
fishes
whose
lives
he
had
saved
the
one
in
the
middle
held
a
mussel
in
its
mouth
which
it
laid
on
the
shore
at
the
youth
s
feet
when
he
had
taken
it
up
and
opened
it
there
lay
the
gold
ring
in
the
shell
full
of
joy
he
took
it
to
the
king
and
expected
that
he
would
grant
him
the
promised
reward
but
when
the
proud
princess
perceived
that
he
was
not
her
equal
in
birth
she
scorned
him
and
required
him
first
to
perform
another
task
she
went
down
into
the
garden
and
strewed
with
her
own
hands
ten
sacksful
of
on
the
grass
then
she
said
morning
before
sunrise
these
must
be
picked
up
and
not
a
single
grain
be
the
youth
sat
down
in
the
garden
and
considered
how
he
might
perform
this
task
but
he
could
think
of
nothing
and
there
he
sat
sorrowfully
awaiting
the
break
of
day
when
he
should
be
led
to
death
but
as
soon
as
the
first
rays
of
the
sun
shone
into
the
garden
he
saw
all
the
ten
sacks
standing
side
by
side
quite
full
and
not
a
single
grain
was
missing
the
had
come
in
the
night
with
thousands
and
thousands
of
ants
and
the
grateful
creatures
had
by
great
industry
picked
up
all
the
and
gathered
them
into
the
sacks
presently
the
king
s
daughter
herself
came
down
into
the
garden
and
was
amazed
to
see
that
the
young
man
had
done
the
task
she
had
given
him
but
she
could
not
yet
conquer
her
proud
heart
and
said
although
he
has
performed
both
the
tasks
he
shall
not
be
my
husband
until
he
has
brought
me
an
apple
from
the
tree
of
the
youth
did
not
know
where
the
tree
of
life
stood
but
he
set
out
and
would
have
gone
on
forever
as
long
as
his
legs
would
carry
him
though
he
had
no
hope
of
finding
it
after
he
had
wandered
through
three
kingdoms
he
came
one
evening
to
a
wood
and
lay
down
under
a
tree
to
sleep
but
he
heard
a
rustling
in
the
branches
and
a
golden
apple
fell
into
his
hand
at
the
same
time
three
ravens
flew
down
to
him
perched
themselves
upon
his
knee
and
said
we
are
the
three
young
ravens
whom
you
saved
from
starving
when
we
had
grown
big
and
heard
that
you
were
seeking
the
golden
apple
we
flew
over
the
sea
to
the
end
of
the
world
where
the
tree
of
life
stands
and
have
brought
you
the
the
youth
full
of
joy
set
out
homeward
and
took
the
golden
apple
to
the
king
s
beautiful
daughter
who
had
now
no
more
excuses
left
to
make
they
cut
the
apple
of
life
in
two
and
ate
it
together
and
then
her
heart
became
full
of
love
for
him
and
they
lived
to
a
great
age
in
undisturbed
happiness
illustration
haensel
and
grethel
hard
by
a
great
forest
dwelt
a
poor
woodcutter
with
his
wife
and
his
two
children
the
boy
was
called
haensel
and
the
girl
grethel
he
had
little
to
bite
and
to
break
and
once
when
great
scarcity
fell
on
the
land
he
could
no
longer
procure
daily
bread
now
when
he
thought
over
this
by
night
in
his
bed
and
tossed
about
in
his
anxiety
he
groaned
and
said
to
his
wife
what
is
to
become
of
us
how
are
we
to
feed
our
poor
children
when
we
no
longer
have
anything
even
for
ourselves
i
ll
tell
you
what
husband
answered
the
woman
early
morning
we
will
take
the
children
out
into
the
forest
to
where
it
is
the
thickest
there
we
will
light
a
fire
for
them
and
give
each
of
them
one
piece
of
bread
more
then
we
will
go
to
our
work
and
leave
them
alone
they
will
not
find
the
way
home
again
and
we
shall
be
rid
of
no
wife
said
the
man
i
will
not
do
that
how
can
i
bear
to
leave
my
children
alone
in
the
forest
the
wild
animals
would
soon
come
and
tear
them
to
oh
you
fool
said
she
then
we
must
all
four
die
of
hunger
you
may
as
well
plane
the
planks
for
our
and
she
left
him
no
peace
until
he
consented
but
i
feel
very
sorry
for
the
poor
children
all
the
same
said
the
man
the
two
children
had
also
not
been
able
to
sleep
for
hunger
and
had
heard
what
the
woman
had
said
to
their
father
grethel
wept
bitter
tears
and
said
to
haensel
now
all
is
over
with
be
quiet
grethel
said
haensel
do
not
distress
yourself
i
will
soon
find
a
way
to
help
and
when
the
old
folk
had
fallen
asleep
he
got
up
put
on
his
little
coat
opened
the
door
below
and
crept
outside
the
moon
shone
brightly
and
the
white
pebbles
which
lay
in
front
of
the
house
glittered
like
real
silver
pennies
haensel
stooped
and
put
as
many
of
them
in
the
little
pocket
of
his
coat
as
he
could
possibly
get
in
then
he
went
back
and
said
to
grethel
be
comforted
dear
little
sister
and
sleep
in
peace
god
will
not
forsake
us
and
he
lay
down
again
in
his
bed
when
day
dawned
but
before
the
sun
had
risen
the
woman
came
and
awoke
the
two
children
saying
get
up
you
sluggards
we
are
going
into
the
forest
to
fetch
she
gave
each
a
little
piece
of
bread
and
said
there
is
something
for
your
dinner
but
do
not
eat
it
up
before
then
for
you
will
get
nothing
grethel
took
the
bread
under
her
apron
as
haensel
had
the
stones
in
his
pocket
then
they
all
set
out
together
on
the
way
to
the
forest
when
they
had
walked
a
short
time
haensel
stood
still
and
peeped
back
and
did
so
again
and
again
while
he
was
throwing
the
white
one
by
one
out
of
his
pocket
onto
the
road
when
they
had
reached
the
middle
of
the
forest
the
father
said
now
children
pile
up
some
wood
and
i
will
light
a
fire
that
you
may
not
be
haensel
and
grethel
gathered
brushwood
together
as
high
as
a
little
hill
the
brushwood
was
lighted
and
when
the
flames
were
burning
very
high
the
woman
said
now
children
lay
yourselves
down
by
the
fire
and
rest
we
will
go
into
the
forest
and
cut
some
wood
when
we
have
done
we
will
come
back
and
fetch
you
haensel
and
grethel
sat
by
the
fire
and
when
noon
came
each
ate
a
little
piece
of
bread
and
as
they
heard
the
strokes
of
the
they
believed
that
their
father
was
near
it
was
however
not
the
axe
it
was
a
branch
which
he
had
fastened
to
a
withered
tree
which
the
wind
was
blowing
backward
and
forward
and
as
they
had
been
sitting
such
a
long
time
their
eyes
shut
with
fatigue
and
they
fell
fast
asleep
when
at
last
they
awoke
it
was
already
dark
night
grethel
began
to
cry
and
said
how
are
we
to
get
out
of
the
forest
now
but
haensel
comforted
her
and
said
just
wait
a
little
until
the
moon
has
risen
and
then
we
shall
soon
find
the
and
when
the
full
moon
had
risen
haensel
took
his
little
sister
by
the
hand
and
followed
the
pebbles
which
shone
like
silver
pieces
and
showed
them
the
way
they
walked
the
whole
night
long
and
by
break
of
day
came
once
more
to
their
father
s
house
they
knocked
at
the
door
and
when
the
woman
opened
it
and
saw
that
it
was
haensel
and
grethel
she
said
you
naughty
children
why
have
you
slept
so
long
in
the
forest
we
thought
you
were
never
coming
back
at
all
the
father
however
rejoiced
for
it
had
cut
him
to
the
heart
to
leave
them
behind
alone
not
long
afterward
there
was
another
famine
in
all
parts
and
the
children
heard
their
mother
saying
at
night
to
their
father
everything
is
eaten
again
we
have
loaf
left
and
after
that
there
is
an
end
the
children
must
go
we
will
take
them
farther
into
the
wood
so
that
they
will
not
find
their
way
out
again
there
is
no
other
means
of
saving
ourselves
the
man
s
heart
was
heavy
and
he
thought
it
would
be
better
for
you
to
share
the
last
mouthful
with
your
children
the
woman
however
would
listen
to
nothing
that
he
had
to
say
but
scolded
and
reproached
him
he
who
says
a
must
say
b
likewise
and
as
he
had
yielded
the
first
time
he
had
to
do
so
a
second
time
also
the
children
were
however
still
awake
and
had
heard
the
conversation
when
the
old
folk
were
asleep
haensel
again
got
up
to
go
out
and
pick
up
pebbles
but
the
woman
had
locked
the
door
and
haensel
could
not
get
out
nevertheless
he
comforted
his
little
sister
and
said
do
not
cry
grethel
go
to
sleep
quietly
the
good
god
will
help
early
in
the
morning
came
the
woman
and
took
the
children
out
of
their
beds
their
bit
of
bread
was
given
to
them
but
it
was
still
smaller
than
the
time
before
on
the
way
into
the
forest
haensel
crumbled
his
in
his
pocket
and
often
stood
still
and
threw
a
morsel
on
the
ground
and
little
by
little
threw
all
the
crumbs
on
the
path
the
woman
led
the
children
still
deeper
into
the
forest
where
they
had
never
in
their
lives
been
before
then
a
great
fire
was
again
made
and
the
mother
said
just
sit
there
you
children
and
when
you
are
tired
you
may
sleep
a
little
we
are
going
into
the
forest
to
cut
wood
in
the
evening
when
we
are
done
we
will
come
and
fetch
you
when
it
was
noon
grethel
shared
her
piece
of
bread
with
haensel
who
had
scattered
his
by
the
way
then
they
fell
asleep
and
evening
passed
but
no
one
came
to
the
poor
children
they
did
not
awake
until
it
was
dark
night
and
haensel
comforted
his
little
sister
and
said
just
wait
grethel
until
the
moon
rises
and
then
we
shall
see
the
crumbs
of
bread
which
i
have
strewn
they
will
show
us
our
way
home
when
the
moon
came
they
set
out
but
they
found
no
crumbs
for
the
many
thousands
of
birds
which
fly
about
in
the
woods
and
fields
had
picked
them
all
up
haensel
said
to
grethel
we
shall
soon
find
the
way
but
they
did
not
find
it
they
walked
the
whole
night
and
all
the
next
day
from
morning
till
evening
but
they
did
not
get
out
of
the
forest
and
were
very
hungry
for
they
had
nothing
to
eat
but
two
or
three
berries
which
grew
on
the
ground
and
as
they
were
so
weary
that
their
legs
would
carry
them
no
longer
they
lay
down
beneath
a
tree
and
fell
asleep
it
was
now
three
mornings
since
they
had
left
their
father
s
house
they
began
to
walk
again
but
they
always
got
deeper
into
the
forest
if
help
did
not
come
soon
they
must
die
of
hunger
and
weariness
when
it
was
midday
they
saw
a
beautiful
bird
sitting
on
a
bough
which
sang
so
delightfully
that
they
stood
still
and
listened
to
it
and
when
it
had
finished
its
song
it
spread
its
wings
and
flew
away
before
them
they
followed
it
until
they
reached
a
little
house
on
the
roof
of
which
it
alighted
when
they
came
quite
up
to
the
little
house
they
saw
that
it
was
built
of
bread
and
covered
with
cakes
but
that
the
windows
were
of
clear
sugar
we
will
set
to
work
on
that
said
haensel
and
have
a
good
meal
i
will
eat
a
bit
of
the
roof
and
you
grethel
can
eat
some
of
the
window
it
will
taste
haensel
reached
up
and
broke
off
a
little
of
the
roof
to
try
how
it
tasted
grethel
leant
against
the
window
and
nibbled
at
the
panes
then
a
soft
voice
cried
from
the
room
nibble
gnaw
who
nibbles
at
my
door
but
the
children
went
on
eating
without
disturbing
themselves
haensel
who
thought
the
roof
tasted
very
nice
tore
down
a
great
piece
of
it
grethel
pushed
out
the
whole
of
one
round
sat
down
and
enjoyed
herself
with
it
suddenly
the
door
opened
and
a
very
very
old
woman
leaning
on
crutches
came
creeping
out
haensel
and
grethel
were
so
terribly
frightened
that
they
let
fall
what
they
had
in
their
hands
the
old
woman
however
nodded
her
head
and
said
oh
you
dear
children
who
has
brought
you
here
do
come
in
and
stay
with
me
no
harm
shall
happen
to
she
took
them
both
by
the
hand
and
led
them
into
her
little
house
then
she
set
good
food
before
them
milk
and
pancakes
with
sugar
apples
and
nuts
afterward
she
covered
two
pretty
little
beds
with
clean
white
linen
and
haensel
and
grethel
lay
down
in
them
and
thought
they
were
in
heaven
the
old
woman
had
only
pretended
to
be
so
kind
she
was
really
a
wicked
witch
who
lay
in
wait
for
children
and
who
had
built
the
little
bread
house
in
order
to
entice
them
there
when
a
child
fell
into
her
power
she
killed
it
cooked
and
ate
it
and
that
was
a
with
her
witches
have
red
eyes
and
can
not
see
far
but
they
have
a
keen
scent
like
the
beasts
and
are
aware
when
human
beings
draw
near
when
haensel
and
grethel
came
into
her
neighborhood
she
laughed
maliciously
and
said
mockingly
i
have
them
they
shall
not
escape
me
again
early
in
the
morning
before
the
children
were
awake
she
was
up
and
when
she
saw
both
of
them
sleeping
and
looking
so
pretty
with
their
plump
red
cheeks
she
muttered
to
herself
that
will
be
a
dainty
mouthful
then
she
seized
haensel
with
her
shrivelled
hand
carried
him
into
a
little
stable
and
shut
him
in
with
a
grated
door
he
might
scream
as
he
liked
that
was
of
no
use
then
she
went
to
grethel
shook
her
till
she
awoke
and
cried
get
up
lazy
thing
fetch
some
water
and
cook
something
good
for
your
brother
he
is
in
the
stable
outside
and
is
to
be
made
fat
when
he
is
fat
i
will
eat
grethel
began
to
weep
bitterly
but
it
was
all
in
vain
she
was
forced
to
do
what
the
wicked
witch
ordered
her
and
now
the
best
food
was
cooked
for
poor
haensel
while
grethel
got
nothing
but
every
morning
the
woman
crept
to
the
little
stable
and
cried
haensel
stretch
out
your
finger
that
i
may
feel
if
you
will
soon
be
when
four
weeks
had
gone
by
she
was
seized
with
impatience
and
would
not
wait
any
longer
ho
there
grethel
she
cried
to
the
girl
be
active
and
bring
some
water
let
haensel
be
fat
or
lean
i
will
kill
him
and
cook
ah
how
the
poor
little
sister
did
lament
when
she
had
to
fetch
the
water
and
how
her
tears
did
flow
down
over
her
cheeks
dear
god
do
help
us
she
cried
if
the
wild
beasts
in
the
forest
had
but
devoured
us
we
should
at
any
rate
have
died
together
just
keep
your
noise
to
yourself
said
the
old
woman
all
that
won
t
help
you
at
early
in
the
morning
grethel
had
to
go
out
and
hang
up
the
cauldron
full
of
water
and
light
the
fire
we
will
bake
first
said
the
old
woman
i
have
already
heated
the
oven
and
kneaded
the
she
pushed
poor
grethel
out
to
the
oven
from
which
flames
of
fire
were
darting
creep
in
said
the
witch
and
see
if
it
is
properly
heated
so
that
we
can
shut
the
bread
and
when
once
grethel
was
inside
she
intended
to
shut
the
oven
and
let
her
bake
in
it
and
then
eat
her
too
but
grethel
saw
what
she
had
in
her
mind
and
would
not
creep
in
silly
goose
said
the
old
woman
the
door
is
big
enough
just
look
i
can
get
in
myself
and
she
crept
up
and
thrust
her
head
in
then
she
fell
over
into
the
oven
and
was
miserably
burnt
to
death
grethel
however
ran
as
quick
as
lightning
to
haensel
opened
his
little
stable
and
cried
haensel
we
are
saved
the
old
witch
is
dead
then
haensel
sprang
out
like
a
bird
from
its
cage
when
the
door
is
opened
for
it
how
they
did
rejoice
and
embrace
each
other
and
dance
about
and
kiss
each
other
and
as
they
had
no
longer
any
need
to
fear
her
they
went
into
the
witch
s
house
and
in
every
corner
there
stood
chests
full
of
pearls
and
jewels
these
are
far
better
than
pebbles
said
haensel
and
thrust
into
his
pockets
whatever
could
be
got
in
and
grethel
said
i
too
will
take
something
home
with
me
and
filled
her
pinafore
full
but
now
we
will
go
away
said
haensel
that
we
may
get
out
of
the
witch
s
when
they
had
walked
for
two
hours
they
came
to
a
great
piece
of
water
we
can
not
get
over
said
haensel
i
see
no
and
no
and
no
boat
crosses
either
answered
grethel
but
a
white
duck
is
swimming
there
if
i
ask
her
she
will
help
us
then
she
cried
duck
little
duck
dost
thou
see
haensel
and
grethel
are
waiting
for
thee
there
s
never
a
plank
nor
a
bridge
in
sight
take
us
across
on
thy
back
so
the
duck
came
to
them
and
haensel
seated
himself
on
her
back
and
told
his
sister
to
sit
by
him
no
replied
grethel
that
will
be
too
heavy
for
the
little
duck
she
shall
take
us
across
one
after
the
the
good
little
duck
did
so
and
when
they
were
once
safely
across
and
had
walked
for
a
short
time
the
forest
seemed
to
be
more
and
more
familiar
to
them
at
length
they
saw
from
afar
their
father
s
house
then
they
began
to
run
rushed
into
the
parlor
and
threw
themselves
into
their
father
s
arms
the
man
had
not
known
one
happy
hour
since
he
had
left
the
children
in
the
forest
the
woman
however
was
dead
grethel
emptied
her
pinafore
until
pearls
and
precious
stones
ran
about
the
room
and
haensel
threw
one
handful
after
another
out
of
his
pocket
to
add
to
them
then
all
trouble
was
at
an
end
and
they
lived
together
in
perfect
happiness
my
tale
is
done
there
runs
a
mouse
whosoever
catches
it
may
make
himself
a
big
big
fur
cap
out
of
it
illustration
the
seven
ravens
there
was
once
a
man
who
had
seven
sons
but
never
a
daughter
no
matter
how
much
he
wished
for
one
at
length
his
wife
had
a
child
and
it
was
a
daughter
the
joy
was
great
but
the
child
was
sickly
and
small
and
so
weak
that
it
had
to
be
baptized
at
once
the
father
sent
one
of
the
boys
in
a
hurry
to
the
spring
to
fetch
water
for
the
baptism
the
other
six
boys
ran
along
with
him
and
as
each
strove
to
be
the
first
to
fill
the
jug
it
fell
into
the
spring
there
they
stood
and
did
not
know
what
to
do
none
of
them
dared
to
go
home
when
they
did
not
come
back
the
father
grew
impatient
and
said
they
have
forgotten
all
about
it
in
a
game
of
play
the
wicked
boys
soon
he
grew
afraid
lest
the
child
should
die
without
being
baptized
and
he
cried
out
in
anger
i
wish
the
boys
were
all
turned
into
ravens
hardly
was
the
word
spoken
before
he
heard
a
whirring
of
wings
in
the
air
above
his
head
he
looked
up
and
saw
seven
ravens
flying
high
and
away
the
parents
could
not
recall
the
curse
and
though
they
grieved
over
the
loss
of
their
seven
sons
yet
they
comforted
themselves
somewhat
with
their
dear
little
daughter
who
soon
grew
strong
and
every
day
more
beautiful
for
a
long
time
she
did
not
know
that
she
had
had
brothers
her
parents
were
careful
not
to
mention
them
before
her
but
one
day
she
chanced
to
overhear
some
people
talking
about
her
and
saying
that
the
maiden
is
certainly
beautiful
but
really
to
blame
for
the
misfortune
of
her
seven
then
she
was
much
troubled
and
went
to
her
father
and
mother
and
asked
if
it
was
true
that
she
had
had
brothers
and
what
was
become
of
them
the
parents
did
not
dare
to
keep
the
secret
longer
and
said
that
her
birth
was
only
the
innocent
cause
of
what
had
happened
to
her
brothers
but
the
maiden
laid
it
daily
to
heart
and
thought
that
she
must
deliver
her
brothers
she
had
no
peace
and
rest
until
she
set
out
secretly
and
went
forth
into
the
wide
world
to
seek
them
out
and
set
them
free
let
it
cost
what
it
might
she
took
nothing
with
her
but
a
little
ring
belonging
to
her
parents
as
a
keepsake
a
loaf
of
bread
against
hunger
a
little
pitcher
of
water
against
thirst
and
a
little
chair
as
a
provision
against
weariness
and
now
she
went
continually
onward
far
far
to
the
very
end
of
the
world
then
she
came
to
the
sun
but
it
was
too
hot
and
terrible
and
devoured
little
children
hastily
she
ran
away
and
ran
to
the
moon
but
it
was
far
too
cold
and
also
awful
and
malicious
and
when
it
saw
the
child
it
said
smell
i
smell
the
flesh
of
men
illustration
each
star
sat
on
its
own
little
chair
on
this
she
ran
swiftly
away
and
came
to
the
stars
which
were
kind
and
good
to
her
and
each
of
them
sat
on
its
own
little
chair
but
the
morning
star
arose
and
gave
her
the
drumstick
of
a
chicken
and
said
if
you
have
not
that
drumstick
you
can
not
open
the
glass
mountain
and
in
the
glass
mountain
are
your
the
maiden
took
the
drumstick
wrapped
it
carefully
in
a
cloth
and
went
onward
again
until
she
came
to
the
glass
mountain
the
door
was
shut
and
she
thought
she
would
take
out
the
drumstick
but
when
she
undid
the
cloth
it
was
empty
and
she
had
lost
the
good
star
s
present
what
was
she
now
to
do
she
wished
to
rescue
her
brothers
and
had
no
key
to
the
glass
mountain
the
good
little
sister
took
a
knife
cut
off
one
of
her
little
fingers
put
it
in
the
door
and
succeeded
in
opening
it
when
she
had
got
inside
a
little
dwarf
came
to
meet
her
who
said
my
child
what
are
you
looking
for
i
am
looking
for
my
brothers
the
seven
ravens
she
replied
the
dwarf
said
the
lord
ravens
are
not
at
home
but
if
you
wish
to
wait
here
until
they
come
step
thereupon
the
little
dwarf
carried
the
ravens
dinner
in
on
seven
little
plates
and
in
seven
little
glasses
the
little
sister
ate
a
morsel
from
each
plate
and
from
each
little
glass
she
took
a
sip
but
in
the
last
little
glass
she
dropped
the
ring
which
she
had
brought
away
with
her
suddenly
she
heard
a
whirring
of
wings
and
a
rushing
through
the
air
and
then
the
little
dwarf
said
now
the
lord
ravens
are
flying
then
they
came
and
wanted
to
eat
and
drink
and
looked
for
their
little
plates
and
glasses
then
said
one
after
the
other
who
has
eaten
something
from
my
plate
who
has
drunk
out
of
my
little
glass
it
was
a
human
and
when
the
seventh
came
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
ring
rolled
against
his
mouth
then
he
looked
at
it
and
saw
that
it
was
a
ring
belonging
to
his
father
and
mother
and
said
god
grant
that
our
little
sister
may
be
here
and
then
we
shall
be
when
the
maiden
who
was
standing
behind
the
door
watching
heard
that
wish
she
came
forth
and
on
this
all
the
ravens
were
restored
to
their
human
form
again
and
they
embraced
and
kissed
each
other
and
went
joyfully
home
illustration
the
wife
of
a
rich
man
fell
sick
and
as
she
felt
that
her
end
was
drawing
near
she
called
her
only
daughter
to
her
bedside
and
said
dear
child
be
good
and
pious
and
then
the
dear
god
will
always
protect
you
and
i
will
look
down
on
you
from
heaven
and
be
near
thereupon
she
closed
her
eyes
and
departed
every
day
the
maiden
went
out
to
her
mother
s
grave
and
wept
and
she
remained
pious
and
good
when
winter
came
the
snow
spread
a
white
sheet
over
the
grave
and
when
the
had
drawn
it
off
again
the
man
had
taken
another
wife
the
woman
had
brought
two
daughters
into
the
house
with
her
who
were
beautiful
and
fair
of
face
but
vile
and
black
of
heart
now
began
a
bad
time
for
the
poor
child
is
the
stupid
goose
to
sit
in
the
parlor
with
us
said
they
he
who
wants
to
eat
bread
must
earn
it
out
with
the
they
took
her
pretty
clothes
away
from
her
put
an
old
gray
bedgown
on
her
and
gave
her
wooden
shoes
just
look
at
the
proud
princess
how
decked
out
she
is
they
cried
and
laughed
and
led
her
into
the
kitchen
there
she
had
to
do
hard
work
from
morning
till
night
get
up
before
daybreak
carry
water
light
fires
cook
and
wash
besides
this
the
sisters
did
her
every
imaginable
injury
they
mocked
her
and
emptied
her
peas
and
lentils
into
the
ashes
so
that
she
was
forced
to
sit
and
pick
them
out
again
in
the
evening
when
she
had
worked
till
she
was
weary
she
had
no
bed
to
go
to
but
had
to
sleep
by
the
fireside
in
the
ashes
and
as
on
that
account
she
always
looked
dusty
and
dirty
they
called
her
it
happened
once
that
the
father
was
going
to
the
fair
and
he
asked
the
two
daughters
what
he
should
bring
back
for
them
beautiful
dresses
said
one
pearls
and
jewels
said
the
second
and
you
said
he
what
will
you
have
father
break
off
for
me
the
first
branch
which
knocks
against
your
hat
on
your
way
so
he
bought
beautiful
dresses
pearls
and
jewels
for
the
two
daughters
and
on
his
way
home
as
he
was
riding
through
a
green
thicket
a
hazel
twig
brushed
against
him
and
knocked
off
his
hat
then
he
broke
off
the
branch
and
took
it
with
him
when
he
reached
home
he
gave
the
two
daughters
the
things
which
they
had
wished
for
and
to
he
gave
the
branch
from
the
thanked
him
went
to
her
mother
s
grave
and
planted
the
branch
on
it
and
wept
so
much
that
the
tears
fell
down
on
it
and
watered
it
it
grew
however
and
became
a
handsome
tree
thrice
a
day
went
and
sat
beneath
it
and
wept
and
prayed
and
a
little
white
bird
always
came
on
the
tree
and
if
expressed
a
wish
the
bird
threw
down
to
her
what
she
had
wished
for
it
happened
that
the
king
gave
a
feast
which
was
to
last
three
days
to
it
all
the
beautiful
young
girls
in
the
country
were
invited
in
order
that
his
son
might
choose
himself
a
bride
when
the
two
sisters
heard
that
they
too
were
to
appear
among
the
number
they
were
delighted
they
called
and
said
comb
our
hair
brush
our
shoes
and
fasten
our
buckles
for
we
are
going
to
the
feast
at
the
king
s
obeyed
but
wept
because
she
too
would
have
liked
to
go
with
them
to
the
dance
and
she
begged
her
mother
to
allow
her
to
do
so
you
go
said
she
you
are
dusty
and
dirty
and
would
go
to
the
feast
you
have
no
clothes
and
shoes
and
yet
would
dance
as
however
went
on
asking
the
mother
at
last
said
i
have
emptied
a
dish
of
lentils
into
the
ashes
for
you
if
you
have
picked
them
out
again
in
two
hours
you
shall
go
with
the
maiden
went
through
the
into
the
garden
and
called
you
tame
pigeons
you
turtledoves
and
all
you
birds
beneath
the
sky
come
and
help
me
to
pick
good
into
the
pot
the
bad
into
the
crop
then
two
white
pigeons
came
in
by
the
and
afterward
the
turtledoves
and
at
last
all
the
birds
beneath
the
sky
came
whirring
and
crowding
in
and
alighted
amongst
the
ashes
and
the
pigeons
nodded
with
their
heads
and
began
pick
pick
pick
and
the
rest
began
also
pick
pick
pick
and
gathered
all
the
good
grains
into
the
dish
hardly
had
one
hour
passed
before
they
had
finished
and
all
flew
out
again
then
the
girl
took
the
dish
to
the
mother
and
was
glad
and
believed
that
now
she
would
be
allowed
to
go
with
them
to
the
feast
but
the
mother
said
no
you
have
no
clothes
and
you
can
not
dance
you
would
only
be
laughed
and
as
wept
at
this
the
mother
said
if
you
can
pick
two
dishes
of
lentils
out
of
the
ashes
for
me
in
one
hour
you
shall
go
with
and
she
thought
to
herself
that
she
most
certainly
can
not
when
the
mother
had
emptied
the
two
dishes
of
lentils
amongst
the
ashes
the
maiden
went
through
the
into
the
garden
and
cried
you
tame
pigeons
you
turtledoves
and
all
you
birds
under
heaven
come
and
help
me
to
pick
good
into
the
pot
the
bad
into
the
crop
then
two
white
pigeons
came
in
by
the
and
afterward
the
turtledoves
and
at
last
all
the
birds
beneath
the
sky
came
whirring
and
crowding
in
and
alighted
amongst
the
ashes
and
the
doves
nodded
with
their
heads
and
began
pick
pick
pick
and
the
others
began
also
pick
pick
pick
and
gathered
all
the
good
seeds
into
the
dishes
and
before
half
an
hour
was
over
they
had
already
finished
and
all
flew
out
again
then
the
maiden
carried
the
dishes
to
the
mother
and
was
delighted
and
believed
that
she
might
now
go
with
them
to
the
feast
but
the
mother
said
all
this
will
not
help
you
you
go
not
with
us
for
you
have
no
clothes
and
can
not
dance
we
should
be
ashamed
of
you
then
she
turned
her
back
on
and
hurried
away
with
her
two
proud
daughters
as
no
one
was
now
at
home
went
to
her
mother
s
grave
beneath
the
and
cried
and
quiver
little
tree
silver
and
gold
throw
over
me
then
the
bird
threw
a
gold
and
silver
dress
down
to
her
and
slippers
embroidered
with
silk
and
silver
she
put
on
the
dress
with
all
speed
and
went
to
the
feast
her
sisters
and
the
mother
however
did
not
know
her
and
thought
she
must
be
a
foreign
princess
for
she
looked
so
beautiful
in
the
golden
dress
they
never
once
thought
of
and
believed
that
she
was
sitting
at
home
in
the
dirt
picking
lentils
out
of
the
ashes
the
prince
went
to
meet
her
took
her
by
the
hand
and
he
danced
with
her
he
would
dance
with
no
other
maiden
and
never
let
go
of
her
hand
and
if
any
one
else
came
to
invite
her
he
said
this
is
my
she
danced
till
it
was
evening
and
then
she
wanted
to
go
home
but
the
king
s
son
said
i
will
go
with
you
and
bear
you
company
for
he
wished
to
see
to
whom
the
beautiful
maiden
belonged
she
escaped
from
him
however
and
sprang
into
the
the
king
s
son
waited
until
her
father
came
and
then
he
told
him
that
the
stranger
maiden
had
leapt
into
the
the
old
man
thought
can
it
be
and
they
had
to
bring
him
an
axe
and
a
pickaxe
that
he
might
hew
the
to
pieces
but
no
one
was
inside
it
and
when
they
got
home
lay
in
her
dirty
clothes
among
the
ashes
and
a
dim
little
was
burning
on
the
mantelpiece
for
had
jumped
quickly
down
from
the
back
of
the
and
had
run
to
the
little
there
she
had
taken
off
her
beautiful
clothes
and
laid
them
on
the
grave
and
the
bird
had
taken
them
away
again
then
she
had
placed
herself
in
the
kitchen
amongst
the
ashes
in
her
gray
gown
next
day
when
the
feast
began
afresh
and
her
parents
and
the
sisters
had
gone
once
more
went
to
the
and
said
and
quiver
little
tree
silver
and
gold
throw
over
me
then
the
bird
threw
down
a
much
more
beautiful
dress
than
on
the
preceding
day
and
when
appeared
at
the
feast
in
this
dress
every
one
was
astonished
at
her
beauty
the
king
s
son
had
waited
until
she
came
and
instantly
took
her
by
the
hand
and
danced
with
no
one
but
her
when
others
came
and
invited
her
he
said
she
is
my
when
evening
arrived
she
wished
to
leave
and
the
king
s
son
followed
her
and
wanted
to
see
into
which
house
she
went
but
she
sprang
away
from
him
and
into
the
garden
behind
the
house
therein
stood
a
beautiful
tall
tree
on
which
hung
the
most
magnificent
pears
she
clambered
like
a
squirrel
so
nimbly
between
the
branches
that
the
king
s
son
did
not
know
where
she
was
gone
he
waited
until
her
father
came
and
said
to
him
the
has
escaped
from
me
and
i
believe
she
has
climbed
up
the
the
father
thought
can
it
be
and
had
an
axe
brought
and
cut
the
tree
down
but
no
one
was
on
it
and
when
they
got
into
the
kitchen
lay
there
amongst
the
ashes
as
usual
for
she
had
jumped
down
on
the
other
side
of
the
tree
had
taken
the
beautiful
dress
to
the
bird
on
the
little
and
had
put
on
her
gray
gown
on
the
third
day
when
the
parents
and
sisters
had
gone
away
went
once
more
to
her
mother
s
grave
and
said
to
the
little
tree
and
quiver
little
tree
silver
and
gold
throw
over
me
and
now
the
bird
threw
down
to
her
a
dress
which
was
more
splendid
and
magnificent
than
any
she
had
yet
had
and
the
slippers
were
golden
and
when
she
went
to
the
feast
in
the
dress
no
one
knew
how
to
speak
for
astonishment
the
king
s
son
danced
with
her
only
and
if
any
one
invited
her
to
dance
he
said
she
is
my
when
evening
came
wished
to
leave
and
the
king
s
son
was
anxious
to
go
with
her
but
she
escaped
from
him
so
quickly
that
he
could
not
follow
her
the
king
s
son
however
had
caused
the
whole
staircase
to
be
smeared
with
pitch
and
there
when
she
ran
down
had
the
maiden
s
left
slipper
remained
sticking
the
king
s
son
picked
it
up
and
it
was
small
and
dainty
and
all
golden
next
morning
he
went
with
it
to
the
father
and
said
to
him
no
one
shall
be
my
wife
but
she
whose
foot
this
golden
slipper
then
were
the
two
sisters
glad
for
they
had
pretty
feet
the
eldest
went
with
the
shoe
into
her
room
and
wanted
to
try
it
on
and
her
mother
stood
by
but
she
could
not
get
her
big
toe
into
it
for
the
shoe
was
too
small
for
her
then
her
mother
gave
her
a
knife
and
said
cut
the
toe
off
when
you
are
queen
you
will
have
no
more
need
to
go
on
the
maiden
cut
the
toe
off
forced
the
foot
into
the
shoe
swallowed
the
pain
and
went
out
to
the
king
s
son
then
he
took
her
on
his
horse
as
his
bride
and
rode
away
with
her
they
were
however
obliged
to
pass
the
grave
and
there
on
the
sat
the
two
pigeons
and
cried
and
peep
turn
and
peep
there
s
blood
within
the
shoe
the
shoe
it
is
too
small
for
her
the
true
bride
waits
for
you
then
he
looked
at
her
foot
and
saw
how
the
blood
was
streaming
from
it
he
turned
his
horse
round
and
took
the
false
bride
home
again
and
said
she
was
not
the
true
one
and
that
the
other
sister
was
to
put
the
shoe
on
then
this
one
went
into
her
chamber
and
got
her
toes
safely
into
the
shoe
but
her
heel
was
too
large
so
her
mother
gave
her
a
knife
and
said
cut
a
bit
off
your
heel
when
you
are
queen
you
will
have
no
more
need
to
go
on
the
maiden
cut
a
bit
off
her
heel
forced
her
foot
into
the
shoe
swallowed
the
pain
and
went
out
to
the
king
s
son
he
took
her
on
his
horse
as
his
bride
and
rode
away
with
her
but
when
they
passed
by
the
two
little
pigeons
sat
on
it
and
cried
and
peep
turn
and
peep
there
s
blood
within
the
shoe
the
shoe
it
is
too
small
for
her
the
true
bride
waits
for
you
he
looked
down
at
her
foot
and
saw
how
the
blood
was
running
out
of
her
shoe
and
how
it
had
stained
her
white
stocking
then
he
turned
his
horse
and
took
the
false
bride
home
again
this
also
is
not
the
right
one
said
he
have
you
no
other
daughter
no
said
the
man
there
is
only
a
little
stunted
which
my
late
wife
left
behind
her
but
she
can
not
possibly
be
the
the
king
s
son
said
he
was
to
send
her
up
to
him
but
the
mother
answered
oh
no
she
is
much
too
dirty
she
can
not
show
herself
he
insisted
on
it
and
had
to
be
called
she
first
washed
her
hands
and
face
clean
and
then
went
and
bowed
down
before
the
king
s
son
who
gave
her
the
golden
shoe
then
she
seated
herself
on
a
stool
drew
her
foot
out
of
the
heavy
wooden
shoe
and
put
it
into
the
slipper
which
fitted
like
a
glove
and
when
she
rose
up
and
the
king
s
son
looked
at
her
face
he
recognized
the
beautiful
maiden
who
had
danced
with
him
and
cried
that
is
the
true
bride
the
mother
and
the
two
sisters
were
terrified
and
became
pale
with
rage
he
however
took
on
his
horse
and
rode
away
with
her
as
they
passed
by
the
the
two
white
doves
cried
and
peep
turn
and
peep
no
blood
is
in
the
shoe
the
shoe
is
not
too
small
for
her
the
true
bride
rides
with
you
and
when
they
had
cried
that
the
two
came
flying
down
and
placed
themselves
on
s
shoulders
one
on
the
right
the
other
on
the
left
and
remained
sitting
there
when
the
wedding
with
the
king
s
son
had
to
be
celebrated
the
two
false
sisters
came
and
wanted
to
get
into
favor
with
and
share
her
good
fortune
when
the
betrothed
couple
went
to
church
the
elder
was
at
the
right
side
and
the
younger
at
the
left
and
the
pigeons
pecked
out
one
eye
of
each
of
them
afterward
as
they
came
back
the
elder
was
at
the
left
and
the
younger
at
the
right
and
then
the
pigeons
pecked
out
the
other
eye
of
each
and
thus
for
their
wickedness
and
falsehood
they
were
punished
with
blindness
as
long
as
they
lived
illustration
the
elves
and
the
shoemaker
a
shoemaker
by
no
fault
of
his
own
had
become
so
poor
that
at
last
he
had
nothing
left
but
leather
for
one
pair
of
shoes
so
in
the
evening
he
cut
out
the
shoes
which
he
wished
to
make
the
next
morning
and
as
he
had
a
good
conscience
he
lay
down
quietly
in
his
bed
commended
himself
to
god
and
fell
asleep
in
the
morning
after
he
had
said
his
prayers
and
was
just
going
to
sit
down
to
work
lo
both
shoes
stood
all
finished
on
his
table
he
was
astounded
and
did
not
know
what
to
say
he
took
the
shoes
in
his
hands
to
examine
them
closer
and
they
were
so
neatly
made
that
there
was
not
one
bad
stitch
in
them
just
as
if
they
were
meant
for
a
masterpiece
soon
after
a
buyer
came
in
and
as
the
shoes
pleased
him
well
he
paid
more
for
them
than
was
customary
and
with
the
money
the
shoemaker
was
able
to
purchase
leather
for
two
pairs
of
shoes
he
cut
them
out
at
night
and
next
morning
was
about
to
set
to
work
with
fresh
courage
but
he
had
no
need
to
do
so
for
when
he
got
up
they
were
already
made
and
buyers
also
were
not
wanting
who
gave
him
money
enough
to
buy
leather
for
four
pairs
of
shoes
the
following
morning
too
he
found
the
four
pairs
made
and
so
it
went
on
constantly
what
he
cut
out
in
the
evening
was
finished
by
morning
so
that
he
soon
had
his
honest
living
again
and
at
last
became
a
wealthy
man
now
it
befell
that
one
evening
not
long
before
christmas
when
the
man
had
been
cutting
out
he
said
to
his
wife
before
going
to
bed
what
think
you
if
we
were
to
stay
up
to
see
who
it
is
that
lends
us
this
helping
hand
the
woman
liked
the
idea
and
lighted
a
candle
and
then
they
hid
themselves
in
a
corner
of
the
room
behind
some
clothes
which
were
hanging
there
and
watched
when
it
was
midnight
two
pretty
tiny
naked
little
men
came
sat
down
by
the
shoemaker
s
table
took
all
the
work
which
was
cut
out
before
them
and
began
to
stitch
sew
and
hammer
so
skilfully
and
so
quickly
with
their
little
fingers
that
the
shoemaker
could
not
turn
away
his
eyes
for
astonishment
they
did
not
stop
until
all
was
done
and
stood
finished
on
the
table
and
then
they
ran
quickly
away
next
morning
the
woman
said
the
little
men
have
made
us
rich
and
we
really
must
show
that
we
are
grateful
for
it
they
run
about
so
much
and
have
nothing
on
and
must
be
cold
i
ll
tell
you
what
i
ll
do
i
will
make
them
little
shirts
coats
vests
and
trousers
and
knit
both
of
them
a
pair
of
stockings
do
you
make
them
two
little
pairs
of
the
man
said
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
do
illustration
the
elves
began
to
stitch
sew
and
hammer
and
one
night
when
everything
was
ready
they
laid
their
presents
instead
of
the
work
all
together
on
the
table
and
then
concealed
themselves
to
see
how
the
little
men
would
behave
at
midnight
they
came
bounding
in
and
wanted
to
get
to
work
at
once
but
as
they
did
not
find
any
leather
cut
out
only
the
pretty
little
articles
of
clothing
they
were
at
first
astonished
and
then
they
showed
intense
delight
they
dressed
themselves
with
the
greatest
rapidity
putting
the
pretty
clothes
on
and
singing
we
are
boys
so
fine
to
see
why
should
we
longer
cobblers
be
then
they
danced
and
skipped
and
leapt
over
chairs
and
benches
at
last
they
danced
out
of
doors
from
that
time
forth
they
came
no
more
but
as
long
as
the
shoemaker
lived
all
went
well
with
him
and
all
his
undertakings
prospered
illustration
the
three
brothers
there
was
once
a
man
who
had
three
sons
and
nothing
else
in
the
world
but
the
house
in
which
he
lived
now
each
of
the
sons
wished
to
have
the
house
after
his
father
s
death
but
the
father
loved
them
all
alike
and
did
not
know
what
to
do
he
did
not
wish
to
sell
the
house
because
it
had
belonged
to
his
forefathers
else
he
might
have
divided
the
money
amongst
them
at
last
a
plan
came
into
his
head
and
he
said
to
his
sons
go
into
the
world
and
try
each
of
you
to
learn
a
trade
when
you
all
come
back
he
who
makes
the
best
masterpiece
shall
have
the
the
sons
were
well
content
with
this
and
the
eldest
determined
to
be
a
blacksmith
the
second
a
barber
and
the
third
a
they
fixed
a
time
when
they
should
all
come
home
again
and
then
each
went
his
way
it
chanced
that
they
all
found
skilful
masters
who
taught
them
their
trades
well
the
blacksmith
had
to
shoe
the
king
s
horses
and
he
thought
to
himself
the
house
is
mine
without
the
barber
shaved
only
great
people
and
he
too
already
looked
upon
the
house
as
his
own
the
got
many
a
blow
but
he
only
bit
his
lip
and
let
nothing
vex
him
for
said
he
to
himself
if
you
are
afraid
of
a
blow
you
ll
never
win
the
when
the
appointed
time
had
gone
by
the
three
brothers
came
back
home
to
their
father
but
they
did
not
know
how
to
find
the
best
opportunity
for
showing
their
skill
so
they
sat
down
and
consulted
together
as
they
were
sitting
thus
all
at
once
a
hare
came
running
across
the
field
ah
ha
just
in
time
said
the
barber
so
he
took
his
basin
and
soap
and
lathered
away
until
the
hare
came
up
then
he
soaped
and
shaved
off
the
hare
s
whiskers
whilst
he
was
running
at
the
top
of
his
speed
and
did
not
even
cut
his
skin
or
injure
a
hair
on
his
body
well
done
said
the
old
man
your
brothers
will
have
to
exert
themselves
wonderfully
or
the
house
will
be
soon
after
up
came
a
nobleman
in
his
coach
dashing
along
at
full
speed
now
you
shall
see
what
i
can
do
father
said
the
blacksmith
so
away
he
ran
after
the
coach
took
all
four
shoes
off
the
feet
of
one
of
the
horses
whilst
he
was
galloping
and
put
on
four
new
shoes
without
stopping
him
you
are
a
fine
fellow
and
as
clever
as
your
brother
said
his
father
i
do
not
know
to
which
i
ought
to
give
the
then
the
third
son
said
father
let
me
have
my
turn
if
you
and
as
it
was
beginning
to
rain
he
drew
his
sword
and
flourished
it
backward
and
forward
above
his
head
so
fast
that
not
a
drop
fell
upon
him
it
rained
still
harder
and
harder
till
at
last
it
came
down
in
torrents
but
he
only
flourished
his
sword
faster
and
faster
and
remained
as
dry
as
if
he
were
sitting
in
a
house
when
his
father
saw
this
he
was
amazed
and
said
this
is
the
masterpiece
the
house
is
yours
his
brothers
were
satisfied
with
this
as
was
agreed
and
as
they
loved
one
another
very
much
they
all
three
stayed
together
in
the
house
followed
their
trades
and
as
they
had
learnt
them
so
well
and
were
so
clever
they
earned
a
great
deal
of
money
thus
they
lived
together
happily
until
they
grew
old
and
at
last
when
one
of
them
fell
sick
and
died
the
two
others
grieved
so
sorely
about
it
that
they
also
fell
ill
and
soon
after
died
and
because
they
had
been
so
clever
and
had
loved
one
another
so
much
they
were
all
laid
in
the
same
grave
illustration
little
table
set
thyself
and
cudgel
out
of
the
sack
there
was
once
upon
a
time
a
tailor
who
had
three
sons
and
only
one
goat
but
as
the
goat
supported
the
whole
of
them
with
her
milk
she
was
obliged
to
have
good
food
and
to
be
taken
every
day
to
pasture
the
sons
therefore
did
this
in
turn
once
the
eldest
took
her
to
the
churchyard
where
the
finest
herbs
were
to
be
found
and
let
her
eat
and
run
about
there
at
night
when
it
was
time
to
go
home
he
asked
goat

goat
answered

said
the
youth
and
took
hold
of
the
cord
round
her
neck
led
her
into
the
stable
and
tied
her
up
securely
well
said
the
old
tailor

the
son

the
father
wished
to
satisfy
himself
and
went
down
to
the
stable

the
dear
animal
and
asked
goat

the
goat
answered
what

said
to
the
youth

said
the
goat
had
had
enough
and
have
let
her
go
hungry
and
in
his
anger
he
took
the
from
the
wall
and
drove
him
out
with
blows
next
day
it
was
the
turn
of
the
second
son
who
looked
out
for
a
place
in
the
fence
of
the
garden
where
nothing
but
good
herbs
grew
and
the
goat
cleared
them
all
off
at
night
when
he
wanted
to
go
home
he
asked
goat

the
goat
answered

the

but
went
down

stable
and
said

goat
answered

the
godless
wretch
cried
the
tailor
to
let
such
a
good
animal
go
hungry
and
he
ran
up
and
drove
the
youth
out
of
doors
with
the
now
came
the
turn
of
the
third
son
who
wanted
to
do
the
thing
well
and
sought
out
some
bushes
with
the
finest
leaves
and
let
the
goat
devour
them
in
the
evening
when
he
wanted
to
go
home
he
asked
goat

the
goat
answered

said
the
youth
and
led
her
into

stable
and
tied
her
up

said
the
old
tailor
has
the
goat
had
a
proper
amount
of
food
she
has
eaten
so
much
not
a
leaf
more
she
ll
the
tailor
did
not
trust
to
that
but
went
down
and
asked
goat
have
you
had
enough
the
wicked
beast
answered
what
should
i
be
satisfied
among
the
graves
i
leapt
about
and
found
no
leaves
so
went
without
ma
ma
oh
the
brood
of
liars
cried
the
tailor
each
as
wicked
and
forgetful
of
his
duty
as
the
other
ye
shall
no
longer
make
a
fool
of
me
and
quite
beside
himself
with
anger
he
ran
and
belabored
the
poor
young
fellow
so
vigorously
with
the
that
he
sprang
out
of
the
house
the
old
tailor
was
now
alone
with
his
goat
next
morning
he
went
down
into
the
stable
caressed
the
goat
and
said
come
my
dear
little
animal
i
myself
will
take
you
to
he
took
her
by
the
rope
and
conducted
her
to
green
hedges
and
amongst
milfoil
and
whatever
else
goats
like
to
eat
there
you
may
for
once
eat
to
your
heart
s
content
said
he
to
her
and
let
her
browse
till
evening
then
he
asked
goat
are
you
satisfied
she
replied
have
eaten
so
much
not
a
leaf
more
i
ll
touch
ma
ma
come
home
then
said
the
tailor
and
led
her
into
the
stable
and
tied
her
fast
when
he
was
going
away
he
turned
round
again
and
said
well
are
you
satisfied
for
once
but
the
goat
did
not
behave
better
to
him
and
cried
what
should
i
be
satisfied
among
the
graves
i
leapt
about
and
found
no
leaves
so
went
without
ma
ma
when
the
tailor
heard
that
he
was
shocked
and
saw
clearly
that
he
had
driven
away
his
three
sons
without
cause
wait
you
ungrateful
creature
cried
he
it
is
not
enough
to
drive
you
forth
i
will
mark
you
so
that
you
will
no
more
dare
to
show
yourself
amongst
honest
tailors
in
great
haste
he
ran
fetched
his
razor
lathered
the
goat
s
head
and
shaved
her
as
clean
as
the
palm
of
his
hand
and
as
the
would
have
been
too
good
for
her
he
brought
the
horsewhip
and
gave
her
such
cuts
with
it
that
she
ran
away
with
mighty
leaps
when
the
tailor
was
thus
left
quite
alone
in
his
house
he
fell
into
great
grief
and
would
gladly
have
had
his
sons
back
again
but
no
one
knew
whither
they
were
gone
the
eldest
had
apprenticed
himself
to
a
joiner
and
learnt
industriously
and
unweariedly
and
when
the
time
came
for
him
to
go
on
his
travels
his
master
presented
him
with
a
little
table
which
had
no
unusual
appearance
and
was
made
of
common
wood
but
it
had
one
good
property
if
any
one
put
it
down
and
said
table
set
thyself
the
good
little
table
was
at
once
covered
with
a
clean
little
cloth
and
a
plate
was
there
and
a
knife
and
fork
beside
it
and
dishes
with
boiled
meats
and
roasted
meats
as
many
as
there
was
room
for
and
a
great
glass
of
red
wine
shone
so
that
it
made
the
heart
glad
the
young
journeyman
thought
with
this
you
have
enough
for
your
whole
life
and
went
joyously
about
the
world
and
never
troubled
himself
whether
an
inn
was
good
or
bad
or
if
anything
was
to
be
found
in
it
or
not
when
it
suited
him
he
did
not
enter
an
inn
at
all
but
either
in
the
plain
a
wood
a
meadow
or
wherever
he
fancied
he
took
his
little
table
off
his
back
set
it
down
before
him
and
said
table
set
thyself
and
then
everything
appeared
that
his
heart
desired
at
length
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
go
back
to
his
father
whose
anger
would
now
be
appeased
and
who
would
now
willingly
receive
him
with
his
it
came
to
pass
that
on
his
way
home
he
arrived
one
evening
at
an
inn
which
was
filled
with
guests
they
bade
him
welcome
and
invited
him
to
sit
and
eat
with
them
for
otherwise
he
would
have
difficulty
in
getting
anything
no
answered
the
joiner
i
will
not
take
the
few
bites
out
of
your
mouths
rather
than
that
you
shall
be
my
they
laughed
and
thought
he
was
joking
he
however
placed
his
wooden
little
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
said
table
set
thyself
instantly
it
was
covered
with
food
so
good
that
the
host
could
never
have
procured
it
and
the
smell
of
it
arose
pleasantly
to
the
noses
of
the
guests
fall
to
dear
friends
said
the
joiner
and
the
guests
when
they
saw
that
he
meant
it
did
not
need
to
be
asked
twice
but
drew
near
pulled
out
their
knives
and
attacked
it
valiantly
and
what
surprised
them
most
was
that
when
a
dish
became
empty
a
full
one
instantly
took
its
place
the
innkeeper
stood
in
one
corner
and
watched
the
doings
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
but
thought
i
could
easily
find
use
for
such
a
cook
as
that
in
my
the
joiner
and
his
comrades
made
merry
until
late
into
the
night
at
length
they
lay
down
to
sleep
and
the
young
apprentice
also
went
to
bed
and
set
his
magic
table
against
the
wall
the
host
s
thoughts
however
let
him
have
no
rest
it
occurred
to
him
that
there
was
a
little
old
table
in
his
which
looked
just
like
the
apprentice
s
and
he
brought
it
out
quite
softly
and
exchanged
it
for
the
next
morning
the
joiner
paid
for
his
bed
took
up
his
table
never
thinking
that
he
had
got
a
false
one
and
went
his
way
at
midday
he
reached
his
father
who
received
him
with
great
joy
well
my
dear
son
what
have
you
learnt
said
he
to
him
father
i
have
become
a
a
good
trade
replied
the
old
man
but
what
have
you
brought
back
with
you
from
your
apprenticeship
father
the
best
thing
which
i
have
brought
back
with
me
is
this
little
the
tailor
examined
it
on
all
sides
and
said
you
did
not
make
a
masterpiece
when
you
made
that
it
is
a
bad
old
but
it
is
a
table
which
furnishes
itself
replied
the
son
when
i
put
it
down
and
tell
it
to
set
itself
the
most
beautiful
dishes
stand
on
it
and
a
wine
also
which
gladdens
the
heart
just
invite
all
our
relations
and
friends
they
shall
refresh
and
enjoy
themselves
for
once
for
the
table
will
give
them
all
they
when
the
company
was
assembled
he
put
his
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
said
table
set
thyself
but
the
little
table
did
not
bestir
itself
and
remained
just
as
bare
as
any
other
table
which
did
not
understand
language
then
the
poor
apprentice
became
aware
that
his
table
had
been
changed
and
was
ashamed
at
having
to
stand
there
like
a
liar
the
relations
however
mocked
him
and
were
forced
to
go
home
without
having
eaten
or
drunk
the
father
brought
out
his
patches
and
began
to
tailor
again
but
the
son
went
to
a
master
in
the
craft
the
second
son
had
gone
to
a
miller
and
had
apprenticed
himself
to
him
when
his
years
were
over
the
master
said
as
you
have
conducted
yourself
so
well
i
give
you
an
ass
of
a
peculiar
kind
which
neither
draws
a
cart
nor
carries
a
to
what
use
is
he
put
then
asked
the
young
apprentice
he
lets
gold
drop
from
his
mouth
answered
the
miller
if
you
set
him
on
a
cloth
and
say
the
good
animal
will
drop
gold
pieces
for
that
is
a
fine
thing
said
the
apprentice
and
thanked
the
master
and
went
out
into
the
world
when
he
had
need
of
gold
he
had
only
to
say
to
his
ass
and
it
rained
gold
pieces
and
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
pick
them
off
the
ground
wheresoever
he
went
the
best
of
everything
was
good
enough
for
him
and
the
dearer
the
better
for
he
had
always
a
full
purse
when
he
had
looked
about
the
world
for
some
time
he
thought
you
must
seek
out
your
father
if
you
go
to
him
with
the
he
will
forget
his
anger
and
receive
you
it
came
to
pass
that
he
reached
the
same
in
which
his
brother
s
table
had
been
exchanged
he
led
his
ass
by
the
bridle
and
the
host
was
about
to
take
the
animal
from
him
to
tie
him
up
but
the
young
apprentice
said
don
t
trouble
yourself
i
will
take
my
gray
horse
into
the
stable
and
tie
him
up
myself
for
i
must
know
where
he
this
struck
the
host
as
odd
and
he
thought
that
a
man
who
was
forced
to
look
after
his
ass
himself
could
not
have
much
to
spend
but
when
the
stranger
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
brought
out
two
gold
pieces
and
said
he
was
to
provide
something
good
for
him
the
host
opened
his
eyes
wide
and
ran
and
sought
out
the
best
he
could
muster
after
dinner
the
guest
asked
what
he
owed
the
host
did
not
see
why
he
should
not
double
the
reckoning
and
said
the
apprentice
must
give
two
more
gold
pieces
he
felt
in
his
pocket
but
his
gold
was
just
at
an
end
wait
an
instant
sir
host
said
he
i
will
go
and
fetch
some
money
but
he
took
the
tablecloth
with
him
the
host
could
not
imagine
what
this
could
mean
and
being
curious
stole
after
him
and
as
the
guest
bolted
the
he
peeped
through
a
hole
left
by
a
knot
in
the
wood
the
stranger
spread
out
the
cloth
under
the
animal
and
cried
and
immediately
the
beast
began
to
let
gold
pieces
fall
so
that
it
fairly
rained
down
money
on
the
ground
eh
my
word
said
the
host
ducats
are
quickly
coined
there
a
purse
like
that
is
not
the
guest
paid
his
score
and
went
to
bed
but
in
the
night
the
host
stole
down
into
the
stable
led
away
the
master
of
the
mint
and
tied
up
another
ass
in
his
place
early
next
morning
the
apprentice
went
away
with
the
ass
and
thought
that
he
had
his
at
midday
he
reached
his
father
who
rejoiced
to
see
him
again
and
gladly
took
him
in
what
have
you
made
of
yourself
my
son
asked
the
old
man
a
miller
dear
father
he
answered
what
have
you
brought
back
with
you
from
your
travels
nothing
else
but
an
there
are
asses
enough
here
said
the
father
i
would
rather
have
had
a
good
yes
replied
the
son
but
it
is
no
common
ass
but
a
when
i
say
the
good
beast
opens
its
mouth
and
drops
a
whole
sheetful
of
gold
pieces
just
summon
all
our
relations
hither
and
i
will
make
them
rich
that
suits
me
well
said
the
tailor
for
then
i
shall
have
no
need
to
torment
myself
any
longer
with
the
needle
and
he
ran
out
and
called
the
relations
together
as
soon
as
they
were
assembled
the
miller
bade
them
make
way
spread
out
his
cloth
and
brought
the
ass
into
the
room
now
watch
said
he
and
cried
but
no
gold
pieces
fell
and
it
was
clear
that
the
animal
knew
nothing
of
the
art
for
every
ass
does
not
attain
such
perfection
then
the
poor
miller
pulled
a
long
face
saw
that
he
was
betrayed
and
begged
pardon
of
the
relatives
who
went
home
as
poor
as
they
came
there
was
no
help
for
it
the
old
man
had
to
betake
him
to
his
needle
once
more
and
the
youth
hired
himself
to
a
miller
the
third
brother
had
apprenticed
himself
to
a
turner
and
as
that
is
skilled
labor
he
was
the
longest
in
learning
his
brothers
however
told
him
in
a
letter
how
badly
things
had
gone
with
them
and
how
the
innkeeper
had
cheated
them
of
their
beautiful
on
the
last
evening
before
they
reached
home
when
the
turner
had
served
his
time
and
had
to
set
out
on
his
travels
as
he
had
conducted
himself
so
well
his
master
presented
him
with
a
sack
and
said
there
is
a
cudgel
in
i
can
put
on
the
sack
said
he
and
it
may
be
of
good
service
to
me
but
why
should
the
cudgel
be
in
it
it
only
makes
it
i
will
tell
you
why
replied
the
master
if
any
one
has
done
anything
to
injure
you
do
but
say
out
of
the
sack
and
the
cudgel
will
leap
forth
among
the
people
and
play
such
a
dance
on
their
backs
that
they
will
not
be
able
to
stir
or
move
for
a
week
and
it
will
not
leave
off
until
you
say
into
the
sack
the
apprentice
thanked
him
put
the
sack
on
his
back
and
when
any
one
came
too
near
him
and
wished
to
attack
him
he
said
out
of
the
sack
and
instantly
the
cudgel
sprang
out
and
dusted
the
coat
or
jacket
of
one
after
the
other
on
their
backs
and
never
stopped
until
it
had
stripped
it
off
them
and
it
was
done
so
quickly
that
before
any
one
was
aware
it
was
already
his
own
turn
in
the
evening
the
young
turner
reached
the
inn
where
his
brothers
had
been
cheated
he
laid
his
sack
on
the
table
before
him
and
began
to
talk
of
all
the
wonderful
things
which
he
had
seen
in
the
world
yes
said
he
people
may
easily
find
a
little
table
which
will
cover
itself
a
and
things
of
that
kind
extremely
good
things
which
i
by
no
means
despise
but
these
are
nothing
in
comparison
with
the
treasure
which
i
have
won
for
myself
and
am
carrying
about
with
me
in
my
sack
the
innkeeper
pricked
up
his
ears
what
in
the
world
can
that
be
thought
he
the
sack
must
be
filled
with
nothing
but
jewels
i
ought
to
get
them
cheap
too
for
all
good
things
go
in
when
it
was
time
for
sleep
the
guest
stretched
himself
on
the
bench
and
laid
his
sack
beneath
him
for
a
pillow
when
the
innkeeper
thought
his
guest
was
lying
in
a
sound
sleep
he
went
to
him
and
pushed
and
pulled
quite
gently
and
carefully
at
the
sack
to
see
if
he
could
possibly
draw
it
away
and
lay
another
in
its
place
the
turner
had
however
been
waiting
for
this
for
a
long
time
and
now
just
as
the
innkeeper
was
about
to
give
a
hearty
tug
he
cried
out
of
the
sack
instantly
the
little
cudgel
came
forth
and
fell
on
the
innkeeper
and
gave
him
a
sound
thrashing
the
host
cried
for
mercy
but
the
louder
he
cried
so
much
the
more
heavily
the
cudgel
beat
time
on
his
back
until
at
length
he
fell
to
the
ground
exhausted
then
the
turner
said
if
you
do
not
give
back
the
little
table
that
sets
itself
and
the
the
dance
shall
begin
oh
no
cried
the
host
quite
humbly
i
will
gladly
bring
out
everything
only
make
the
accursed
kobold
creep
back
into
the
sack
then
said
the
apprentice
i
will
let
mercy
take
the
place
of
justice
but
beware
of
getting
into
mischief
again
so
he
cried
into
the
sack
and
let
him
have
rest
next
morning
the
turner
went
home
to
his
father
with
the
and
the
the
tailor
rejoiced
when
he
saw
him
once
more
and
asked
him
likewise
what
he
had
learned
in
foreign
parts
dear
father
said
he
i
have
become
a
a
skilled
trade
said
the
father
what
have
you
brought
back
with
you
from
your
travels
a
precious
thing
dear
father
replied
the
son
a
cudgel
in
the
what
cried
the
father
a
cudgel
that
s
worth
your
trouble
indeed
from
every
tree
you
can
cut
one
for
but
not
one
like
this
dear
father
if
i
say
out
of
the
sack
the
cudgel
springs
out
and
leads
any
one
who
means
ill
by
me
a
weary
dance
and
never
stops
until
he
lies
on
the
ground
and
prays
for
fair
weather
look
you
with
this
cudgel
have
i
got
back
the
and
the
which
the
thievish
innkeeper
took
away
from
my
brothers
now
let
them
both
be
sent
for
and
invite
all
our
kinsmen
i
will
give
them
to
eat
and
to
drink
and
will
fill
their
pockets
with
gold
into
the
the
old
tailor
would
not
quite
believe
but
nevertheless
got
the
relatives
together
then
the
turner
spread
a
cloth
in
the
room
and
led
in
the
and
said
to
his
brother
now
dear
brother
speak
to
the
miller
said
and
instantly
the
gold
pieces
fell
down
on
the
cloth
like
a
and
the
ass
did
not
stop
until
every
one
of
them
had
so
much
that
he
could
carry
no
more
i
can
see
in
your
face
that
you
also
would
have
liked
to
be
there
then
the
turner
brought
the
little
table
and
said
now
dear
brother
speak
to
and
scarcely
had
the
carpenter
said
table
set
thyself
than
it
was
spread
and
covered
with
the
most
exquisite
dishes
then
such
a
meal
took
place
as
the
good
tailor
had
never
yet
known
in
his
house
the
whole
party
of
kinsmen
stayed
together
till
far
in
the
night
and
were
all
merry
and
glad
the
tailor
locked
away
needle
and
thread
and
goose
in
a
press
and
lived
with
his
three
sons
in
joy
and
splendor
what
however
has
become
of
the
goat
who
was
to
blame
for
the
tailor
driving
out
his
three
sons
that
i
will
tell
you
she
was
ashamed
that
she
had
a
bald
head
and
ran
to
a
fox
s
hole
and
crept
into
it
when
the
fox
came
home
he
was
met
by
two
great
eyes
shining
out
of
the
darkness
and
was
terrified
and
ran
away
a
bear
met
him
and
as
the
fox
looked
quite
disturbed
he
said
what
is
the
matter
with
you
brother
fox
why
do
you
look
like
that
ah
answered
redskin
a
fierce
beast
is
in
my
cave
and
stared
at
me
with
its
fiery
we
will
soon
drive
him
out
said
the
bear
and
went
with
him
to
the
cave
and
looked
in
but
when
he
saw
the
fiery
eyes
fear
seized
him
likewise
he
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
furious
beast
and
took
to
his
heels
the
bee
met
him
and
as
she
saw
that
he
was
ill
at
ease
she
said
bear
you
are
really
pulling
a
very
pitiful
face
what
has
become
of
all
your
jollity
it
is
all
very
well
for
you
to
talk
replied
the
bear
a
furious
beast
with
staring
eyes
is
in
redskin
s
house
and
we
can
t
drive
him
the
bee
said
bear
i
pity
you
i
am
a
poor
weak
creature
whom
you
would
not
turn
aside
to
look
at
yet
i
believe
i
can
help
she
flew
into
the
fox
s
cave
lighted
on
the
goat
s
clean
shaved
head
and
stung
her
so
hard
that
she
sprang
up
crying
ma
and
ran
forth
into
the
world
like
mad
and
to
this
hour
no
one
knows
where
she
has
gone
illustration
iron
john
once
on
a
time
there
was
a
king
who
had
a
great
forest
near
his
palace
full
of
all
kinds
of
wild
animals
one
day
he
sent
out
a
huntsman
to
shoot
him
a
roe
but
he
did
not
come
back
perhaps
some
accident
has
befallen
him
said
the
king
and
the
next
day
he
sent
out
two
more
huntsmen
who
were
to
search
for
him
but
they
too
stayed
away
then
on
the
third
day
he
sent
for
all
his
huntsmen
and
said
scour
the
whole
forest
through
and
do
not
give
up
until
ye
have
found
all
but
of
these
also
none
came
home
again
and
of
the
pack
of
hounds
which
they
had
taken
with
them
none
were
seen
more
from
that
time
forth
no
one
would
any
longer
venture
into
the
forest
and
it
lay
in
deep
stillness
and
solitude
nothing
was
seen
but
sometimes
an
eagle
or
a
hawk
flying
over
it
this
lasted
for
many
years
when
a
strange
huntsman
came
to
the
king
asking
for
work
and
offered
to
go
into
the
dangerous
forest
the
king
however
would
not
give
his
consent
and
said
it
is
not
safe
in
there
i
fear
it
would
fare
with
you
no
better
than
with
the
others
and
you
would
never
come
out
the
huntsman
replied
lord
i
will
venture
it
at
my
own
risk
of
fear
i
know
the
huntsman
therefore
betook
himself
with
his
dog
to
the
forest
it
was
not
long
before
the
dog
fell
in
with
some
game
and
wanted
to
pursue
it
but
hardly
had
the
dog
run
two
steps
when
he
stood
before
a
deep
pool
and
could
go
no
farther
then
a
naked
arm
stretched
itself
out
of
the
water
seized
him
and
drew
him
under
when
the
huntsman
saw
that
he
went
back
and
fetched
three
men
to
come
with
buckets
and
bale
out
the
water
when
they
could
see
the
bottom
there
lay
a
wild
man
whose
body
was
brown
like
rusty
iron
and
whose
hair
hung
over
his
face
down
to
his
knees
they
bound
him
with
cords
and
led
him
away
to
the
castle
there
was
great
astonishment
over
the
wild
man
the
king
had
him
put
in
an
iron
cage
in
his
courtyard
and
forbade
the
door
to
be
opened
on
pain
of
death
and
the
queen
herself
was
to
take
the
key
into
her
keeping
and
from
this
time
forth
every
one
could
once
more
go
into
the
forest
with
safety
the
king
had
a
son
eight
years
old
who
one
day
was
playing
in
the
courtyard
and
while
he
was
playing
his
golden
ball
fell
into
the
cage
the
boy
ran
thither
and
said
give
me
my
not
till
you
have
opened
the
door
for
me
answered
the
man
no
said
the
boy
i
will
not
do
that
the
king
has
forbidden
it
and
ran
away
the
next
day
he
again
went
and
asked
for
his
ball
the
wild
man
said
open
my
door
but
the
boy
would
not
on
the
third
day
when
the
king
had
ridden
out
hunting
the
boy
went
once
more
and
said
i
can
not
open
the
door
even
if
i
wished
for
i
have
not
the
then
the
wild
man
said
it
lies
under
your
mother
s
pillow
you
can
get
it
the
boy
who
wanted
to
have
his
ball
back
cast
all
thought
to
the
winds
and
brought
the
key
the
door
opened
with
difficulty
and
the
boy
pinched
his
fingers
when
it
was
open
the
wild
man
stepped
out
gave
him
the
golden
ball
and
hurried
away
but
the
boy
was
afraid
he
called
and
cried
after
him
oh
wild
man
do
not
go
away
or
i
shall
be
beaten
the
wild
man
turned
back
took
him
up
set
him
on
his
shoulder
and
went
with
hasty
steps
into
the
forest
when
the
king
came
home
he
saw
the
empty
cage
and
asked
the
queen
how
that
had
happened
she
knew
nothing
about
it
and
sought
the
key
but
it
was
gone
she
called
the
boy
but
no
one
answered
the
king
sent
out
people
to
seek
for
him
in
the
fields
but
they
did
not
find
him
then
he
could
easily
guess
what
had
happened
and
much
grief
reigned
in
the
royal
court
when
the
wild
man
had
reached
once
more
the
dark
forest
he
took
the
boy
down
from
his
shoulder
and
said
to
him
you
will
never
see
your
father
and
mother
again
but
i
will
keep
you
with
me
for
you
have
set
me
free
and
i
pity
you
if
you
do
all
i
bid
you
you
shall
fare
well
of
treasure
and
gold
have
i
enough
and
more
than
any
one
in
the
he
made
a
bed
of
moss
for
the
boy
on
which
he
slept
and
the
next
morning
the
man
took
him
to
a
well
and
said
behold
the
gold
well
is
as
bright
and
clear
as
crystal
you
shall
sit
beside
it
and
take
care
that
nothing
falls
into
it
or
it
will
be
polluted
i
will
come
every
evening
to
see
if
you
have
obeyed
my
the
boy
placed
himself
by
the
margin
of
the
well
and
often
saw
a
golden
fish
or
a
golden
snake
show
itself
therein
and
he
took
care
that
nothing
fell
in
as
he
was
sitting
thus
his
finger
hurt
him
so
violently
that
without
thinking
he
put
it
in
the
water
he
drew
it
quickly
out
again
but
saw
that
it
was
quite
gilded
and
whatsoever
pains
he
took
to
wash
the
gold
off
again
all
was
to
no
purpose
in
the
evening
iron
john
came
back
looked
at
the
boy
and
said
what
has
happened
to
the
well
nothing
nothing
he
answered
and
held
his
finger
behind
his
back
that
the
man
might
not
see
it
but
he
said
you
have
dipped
your
finger
into
the
water
this
time
it
may
pass
but
take
care
you
do
not
again
let
anything
get
at
daybreak
the
boy
was
already
sitting
by
the
well
and
watching
it
his
finger
hurt
him
again
and
he
passed
it
over
his
head
and
then
unhappily
a
hair
fell
down
into
the
well
he
took
it
quickly
out
but
it
was
quite
gilded
iron
john
came
and
already
knew
what
had
happened
you
have
let
a
hair
fall
into
the
well
said
he
i
will
allow
you
to
watch
by
it
once
more
but
if
this
happens
the
third
time
then
the
well
will
be
polluted
and
you
can
no
longer
remain
with
on
the
third
day
the
boy
sat
by
the
well
and
did
not
stir
his
finger
however
much
it
hurt
him
but
the
time
was
long
to
him
and
he
looked
at
the
reflection
of
his
face
on
the
surface
of
the
water
and
as
he
still
bent
down
more
and
more
trying
to
look
straight
into
the
eyes
his
long
hair
fell
down
from
his
shoulders
into
the
water
he
raised
himself
up
quickly
but
the
whole
of
the
hair
of
his
head
was
golden
and
shone
like
the
sun
you
may
imagine
how
terrified
the
poor
boy
was
he
took
his
and
tied
it
round
his
head
in
order
that
the
man
might
not
see
it
when
he
came
he
already
knew
everything
and
said
take
off
the
then
the
golden
hair
streamed
forth
and
let
the
boy
excuse
himself
as
he
might
it
was
of
no
use
you
have
not
stood
the
trial
and
can
no
longer
stay
here
go
forth
into
the
world
there
you
will
learn
what
poverty
is
but
as
you
have
not
a
bad
heart
and
as
i
mean
well
by
you
there
is
one
thing
i
will
grant
you
if
you
fall
into
any
difficulty
come
to
the
forest
and
cry
iron
john
and
then
i
will
come
and
help
you
my
power
is
great
greater
than
you
think
and
i
have
gold
and
silver
in
then
the
king
s
son
left
the
forest
and
walked
by
beaten
and
unbeaten
paths
ever
onward
until
at
length
he
reached
a
great
city
there
he
looked
for
work
but
could
find
none
and
he
had
learnt
nothing
by
which
he
could
help
himself
at
length
he
went
to
the
palace
and
asked
if
they
would
take
him
in
the
people
about
court
did
not
know
what
use
to
make
of
him
but
they
liked
him
and
told
him
to
stay
at
last
the
cook
took
him
into
his
service
and
said
he
might
carry
wood
and
water
and
rake
the
cinders
together
once
when
it
happened
that
no
one
else
was
at
hand
the
cook
ordered
him
to
carry
the
food
to
the
royal
table
but
as
he
did
not
like
to
let
his
golden
hair
be
seen
he
kept
his
little
hat
on
such
a
thing
as
that
had
never
come
under
the
king
s
notice
and
he
said
when
you
serve
at
the
royal
table
you
must
take
off
your
he
answered
ah
lord
i
can
not
then
the
king
had
the
cook
called
before
him
he
scolded
him
and
asked
how
he
could
take
such
a
boy
as
that
into
his
service
and
said
that
he
was
to
turn
him
off
at
once
the
cook
however
had
pity
on
him
and
exchanged
him
for
the
gardener
s
boy
and
now
the
boy
had
to
plant
and
water
the
garden
hoe
and
dig
and
bear
the
wind
and
bad
weather
one
day
in
summer
when
he
was
working
alone
in
the
garden
the
day
was
so
warm
he
took
his
little
hat
off
that
the
air
might
cool
him
as
the
sun
shone
on
his
hair
it
glittered
and
flashed
so
that
the
rays
fell
into
the
bedroom
of
the
king
s
daughter
up
she
sprang
to
see
what
it
could
be
then
she
saw
the
boy
and
cried
to
him
boy
bring
me
a
wreath
of
illustration
the
king
s
daughter
pulled
off
his
hat
he
put
his
hat
on
with
all
haste
and
gathered
wild
and
bound
them
together
when
he
was
ascending
the
stairs
with
them
the
gardener
met
him
and
said
how
can
you
take
the
king
s
daughter
a
garland
of
such
common
flowers
go
quickly
and
get
another
and
seek
out
the
prettiest
and
oh
no
replied
the
boy
the
wild
ones
have
more
scent
and
will
please
her
when
he
went
into
the
room
the
king
s
daughter
said
take
your
cap
off
it
is
not
seemly
to
keep
it
on
in
my
he
again
said
i
can
not
she
however
caught
at
his
hat
and
pulled
it
off
and
then
his
golden
hair
rolled
down
on
his
shoulders
and
it
was
splendid
to
behold
he
wanted
to
run
out
but
she
held
him
by
the
arm
and
gave
him
a
handful
of
ducats
with
these
he
departed
but
he
cared
nothing
for
the
gold
pieces
he
took
them
to
the
gardener
and
said
i
give
them
to
your
children
they
may
play
with
the
following
day
the
king
s
daughter
again
called
to
him
that
he
was
to
bring
her
a
wreath
of
when
he
went
in
with
it
she
snatched
at
his
hat
and
wanted
to
take
it
away
from
him
but
he
held
it
fast
with
both
hands
she
again
gave
him
a
handful
of
ducats
but
he
would
not
keep
them
and
presented
them
to
the
gardener
as
playthings
for
his
children
on
the
third
day
things
went
just
the
same
she
could
not
get
his
hat
away
from
him
and
he
would
not
have
her
money
not
long
afterward
the
country
was
overrun
by
war
the
king
gathered
together
his
people
and
did
not
know
whether
or
not
he
could
overcome
the
enemy
who
was
superior
in
strength
and
had
a
mighty
army
then
said
the
gardener
s
boy
i
am
grown
up
and
will
go
to
the
wars
also
only
give
me
a
the
others
laughed
and
said
seek
one
for
yourself
when
we
are
gone
we
will
leave
one
behind
us
in
the
stable
for
when
they
had
gone
forth
he
went
into
the
stable
and
got
the
horse
it
was
lame
of
one
foot
and
limped
jig
hobblety
nevertheless
he
mounted
it
and
rode
away
to
the
dark
forest
when
he
came
to
the
outskirts
he
called
iron
john
three
times
so
loudly
that
it
echoed
through
the
trees
thereupon
the
wild
man
appeared
immediately
and
said
what
do
you
desire
i
want
a
strong
steed
for
i
am
going
to
the
that
you
shall
have
and
still
more
than
you
then
the
wild
man
went
back
into
the
forest
and
it
was
not
long
before
a
came
out
of
it
who
led
a
horse
that
snorted
and
could
hardly
be
restrained
behind
them
followed
a
great
troop
of
soldiers
entirely
equipped
in
iron
and
their
swords
flashed
in
the
sun
the
youth
made
over
his
horse
to
the
mounted
the
other
and
rode
at
the
head
of
the
soldiers
when
he
drew
near
the
a
great
part
of
the
king
s
men
had
already
fallen
and
little
was
wanting
to
make
the
rest
give
way
then
the
youth
galloped
thither
with
his
iron
soldiers
broke
like
a
hurricane
over
the
enemy
and
beat
down
all
who
opposed
him
they
began
to
fly
but
the
youth
pursued
and
never
stopped
until
there
was
not
a
single
man
left
instead
however
of
returning
to
the
king
he
conducted
his
troop
by
to
the
forest
and
called
iron
john
what
do
you
desire
asked
the
wild
man
take
back
your
horse
and
troops
and
give
me
my
horse
all
that
he
asked
was
done
and
soon
he
was
riding
on
his
horse
when
the
king
returned
to
his
palace
his
daughter
went
to
meet
him
and
wished
him
joy
of
his
victory
i
am
not
the
one
who
carried
away
the
victory
said
he
but
a
stranger
knight
who
came
to
my
assistance
with
his
the
daughter
wanted
to
hear
who
the
strange
knight
was
but
the
king
did
not
know
and
said
he
followed
the
enemy
and
i
did
not
see
him
she
inquired
of
the
gardener
where
his
boy
was
but
he
smiled
and
said
he
has
just
come
home
on
his
horse
and
the
others
have
been
mocking
him
and
crying
here
comes
our
hobblety
jig
back
again
they
asked
too
under
what
hedge
have
you
been
lying
sleeping
all
the
time
he
however
answered
i
did
the
best
of
all
and
it
would
have
gone
badly
without
and
then
he
was
ridiculed
still
the
king
said
to
his
daughter
i
will
proclaim
a
great
feast
that
shall
last
for
three
days
and
you
shall
throw
a
golden
apple
perhaps
the
unknown
will
come
to
when
the
feast
was
announced
the
youth
went
out
to
the
forest
and
called
iron
john
what
do
you
desire
asked
he
that
i
may
catch
the
king
s
daughter
s
golden
it
is
as
safe
as
if
you
had
it
already
said
iron
john
you
shall
likewise
have
a
suit
of
red
armor
for
the
occasion
and
ride
on
a
spirited
chestnut
when
the
day
came
the
youth
galloped
to
the
spot
took
his
place
amongst
the
knights
and
was
recognized
by
no
one
the
king
s
daughter
came
forward
and
threw
a
golden
apple
to
the
knights
none
of
them
caught
it
but
he
only
as
soon
as
he
had
it
he
galloped
away
on
the
second
day
iron
john
equipped
him
as
a
white
knight
and
gave
him
a
white
horse
again
he
was
the
only
one
who
caught
the
apple
and
he
did
not
linger
an
instant
but
galloped
off
with
it
the
king
grew
angry
and
said
that
is
not
allowed
he
must
appear
before
me
and
tell
his
he
gave
the
order
that
if
the
knight
who
caught
the
apple
should
go
away
again
they
should
pursue
him
and
if
he
would
not
come
back
willingly
they
should
cut
him
down
and
stab
him
on
the
third
day
he
received
from
iron
john
a
suit
of
black
armor
and
a
black
horse
again
he
caught
the
apple
but
when
he
was
riding
off
with
it
the
king
s
attendants
pursued
him
and
one
of
them
got
so
near
that
he
wounded
the
youth
s
leg
with
the
point
of
his
sword
the
youth
nevertheless
escaped
from
them
but
his
horse
leapt
so
violently
that
the
helmet
fell
from
his
head
and
they
could
see
that
he
had
golden
hair
they
rode
back
and
announced
this
to
the
king
the
following
day
the
king
s
daughter
asked
the
gardener
about
his
boy
he
is
at
work
in
the
garden
the
queer
creature
has
been
at
the
festival
too
and
only
came
home
yesterday
evening
he
has
likewise
shown
my
children
three
golden
apples
which
he
has
the
king
had
him
summoned
into
his
presence
he
came
and
again
had
his
hat
on
his
head
but
the
king
s
daughter
went
up
to
him
and
took
it
off
then
his
golden
hair
fell
down
over
his
shoulders
and
he
was
so
handsome
that
all
were
amazed
are
you
the
knight
who
came
every
day
to
the
festival
always
in
different
colors
and
who
caught
the
three
golden
apples
asked
the
king
yes
answered
he
and
here
are
the
apples
and
he
took
them
out
of
his
pocket
and
returned
them
to
the
king
if
you
desire
further
proof
you
may
see
the
wound
which
your
people
gave
me
when
they
followed
me
but
i
am
likewise
the
knight
who
helped
you
win
your
victory
over
your
if
you
can
perform
such
deeds
as
that
you
are
no
gardener
s
boy
tell
me
who
is
your
father
my
father
is
a
mighty
king
and
gold

in
plenty
as
much
as
i
i
well
see
said
the
king
that
i
owe
thanks
to
you
can
i
do
anything
to
please
you
yes
answered
he
that
indeed
you
can
give
me
your
daughter
to
the
maiden
laughed
and
said
he
does
not
stand
much
on
ceremony
but
i
have
already
seen
by
his
golden
hair
that
he
is
no
gardener
s
boy
and
then
she
went
and
kissed
him
his
father
and
mother
came
to
the
wedding
and
were
in
great
delight
for
they
had
given
up
all
hope
of
ever
seeing
their
dear
son
again
and
as
they
were
sitting
at
the
the
music
suddenly
stopped
the
doors
opened
and
a
stately
king
came
in
with
a
great
retinue
he
went
up
to
the
youth
embraced
him
and
said
i
am
iron
john
and
was
by
enchantment
a
wild
man
but
you
have
set
me
free
all
the
treasures
which
i
possess
shall
be
illustration
clever
elsie
there
was
once
a
man
who
had
a
daughter
who
was
called
clever
elsie
and
when
she
had
grown
up
her
father
said
we
will
get
her
yes
said
the
mother
if
only
any
one
would
come
who
would
have
at
length
a
man
came
from
a
distance
and
wooed
her
who
was
called
hans
but
he
made
one
condition
that
clever
elsie
should
be
really
wise
oh
said
the
father
she
s
sharp
and
the
mother
said
oh
she
can
see
the
wind
coming
up
the
street
and
hear
the
flies
well
said
hans
if
she
is
not
really
wise
i
won
t
have
when
they
were
sitting
at
dinner
and
had
eaten
the
mother
said
elsie
go
into
the
cellar
and
fetch
some
then
clever
elsie
took
the
pitcher
from
the
wall
went
into
the
cellar
and
tapped
the
lid
briskly
as
she
went
that
the
time
might
not
appear
long
when
she
was
below
she
fetched
herself
a
chair
and
set
it
before
the
barrel
so
that
she
had
no
need
to
stoop
and
did
not
hurt
her
back
or
do
herself
any
unexpected
injury
then
she
placed
the
can
before
her
and
turned
the
tap
and
while
the
beer
was
running
she
would
not
let
her
eyes
be
idle
but
looked
up
at
the
wall
and
after
much
peering
here
and
there
saw
a
pickaxe
exactly
above
her
which
the
masons
had
left
there
by
mistake
then
clever
elsie
began
to
weep
and
said
if
i
get
hans
and
we
have
a
child
and
he
grows
big
and
we
send
him
into
the
cellar
here
to
draw
beer
then
the
pickaxe
will
fall
on
his
head
and
kill
then
she
sat
and
wept
and
screamed
with
all
the
strength
of
her
body
over
the
misfortune
which
lay
before
her
those
upstairs
waited
for
the
drink
but
clever
elsie
still
did
not
come
then
the
woman
said
to
the
servant
just
go
down
into
the
cellar
and
see
where
elsie
the
maid
went
and
found
her
sitting
in
front
of
the
barrel
screaming
loudly
elsie
why
do
you
weep
asked
the
maid
ah
she
answered
have
i
not
reason
to
weep
if
i
get
hans
and
we
have
a
child
and
he
grows
big
and
has
to
draw
beer
here
the
pickaxe
may
fall
on
his
head
and
kill
then
said
the
maid
what
a
clever
elsie
we
have
and
sat
down
beside
her
and
began
loudly
to
weep
over
the
misfortune
after
a
while
as
the
maid
did
not
come
back
and
those
upstairs
were
thirsty
for
the
beer
the
man
said
to
the
boy
just
go
down
into
the
cellar
and
see
where
elsie
and
the
girl
the
boy
went
down
and
there
sat
clever
elsie
and
the
girl
both
weeping
together
then
he
asked
why
are
you
weeping
ah
said
elsie
have
i
not
reason
to
weep
if
i
get
hans
and
we
have
a
child
and
he
grows
big
and
has
to
draw
beer
here
the
pickaxe
will
fall
on
his
head
and
kill
then
said
the
boy
what
a
clever
elsie
we
have
and
sat
down
by
her
and
likewise
began
to
howl
loudly
upstairs
they
waited
for
the
boy
but
as
he
did
not
return
the
man
said
to
the
woman
just
go
down
into
the
cellar
and
see
where
elsie
is
the
woman
went
down
and
found
all
three
in
the
midst
of
their
lamentations
and
inquired
what
was
the
cause
then
elsie
told
her
also
that
her
future
child
was
to
be
killed
by
the
pickaxe
when
it
grew
big
and
had
to
draw
beer
and
the
pickaxe
fell
down
then
said
the
mother
likewise
what
a
clever
elsie
we
have
and
sat
down
and
wept
with
them
the
man
upstairs
waited
a
short
time
but
as
his
wife
did
not
come
back
and
his
thirst
grew
ever
greater
he
said
i
must
go
into
the
cellar
myself
and
see
where
elsie
but
when
he
got
into
the
cellar
and
they
were
all
sitting
together
crying
and
he
heard
the
reason
and
that
elsie
s
child
was
the
cause
and
that
elsie
might
perhaps
bring
one
into
the
world
some
day
and
that
it
might
be
killed
by
the
pickaxe
if
it
should
happen
to
be
sitting
beneath
it
drawing
beer
just
at
the
very
time
when
it
fell
he
cried
oh
what
a
clever
elsie
and
sat
down
and
likewise
wept
with
them
the
bridegroom
stayed
alone
for
a
long
time
then
as
no
one
came
back
he
thought
they
must
be
waiting
for
me
below
i
too
must
go
there
and
see
what
they
are
when
he
got
down
all
five
of
them
were
sitting
screaming
and
lamenting
quite
piteously
each
outdoing
the
other
what
misfortune
has
happened
then
asked
he
ah
dear
hans
said
elsie
if
we
marry
each
other
and
have
a
child
and
he
is
big
and
we
perhaps
send
him
here
to
draw
something
to
drink
then
the
pickaxe
which
has
been
left
up
there
might
dash
his
brains
out
if
it
were
to
fall
down
so
have
we
not
reason
to
weep
come
said
hans
more
understanding
than
that
is
not
needed
for
my
household
as
you
are
such
a
clever
elsie
i
will
have
you
and
he
seized
her
hand
took
her
upstairs
with
him
and
married
her
after
hans
had
had
her
some
time
he
said
wife
i
am
going
out
to
work
and
earn
money
for
us
go
into
the
field
and
cut
the
corn
that
we
may
have
some
yes
dear
hans
i
will
do
after
hans
had
gone
away
she
cooked
herself
some
good
broth
and
took
it
into
the
field
with
her
when
she
came
to
the
field
she
said
to
herself
what
shall
i
do
shall
i
shear
first
or
shall
i
eat
first
oh
i
will
eat
then
she
emptied
her
basin
of
broth
and
when
she
was
fully
satisfied
she
once
more
said
what
shall
i
do
shall
i
shear
first
or
shall
i
sleep
first
i
will
sleep
then
she
lay
down
among
the
corn
and
fell
asleep
hans
had
been
at
home
for
a
long
time
but
elsie
did
not
come
then
said
he
what
a
clever
elsie
i
have
she
is
so
industrious
that
she
does
not
even
come
home
to
as
however
she
still
stayed
away
and
it
was
evening
hans
went
out
to
see
what
she
had
cut
but
nothing
was
cut
and
she
was
lying
among
the
corn
asleep
then
hans
hastened
home
and
brought
a
fowler
s
net
with
little
bells
and
hung
it
round
about
her
and
she
still
went
on
sleeping
then
he
ran
home
shut
the
and
sat
down
in
his
chair
and
worked
at
length
when
it
was
quite
dark
clever
elsie
awoke
and
when
she
got
up
there
was
a
jingling
all
round
about
her
and
the
bells
rang
at
each
step
which
she
took
then
she
was
frightened
and
became
uncertain
whether
she
really
was
clever
elsie
or
not
and
said
is
it
i
or
is
it
not
i
but
she
knew
not
what
answer
to
make
to
this
and
stood
for
a
time
in
doubt
at
length
she
thought
i
will
go
home
and
ask
if
it
be
i
or
if
it
be
not
i
they
will
be
sure
to
she
ran
to
the
door
of
her
own
house
but
it
was
shut
then
she
knocked
at
the
window
and
cried
hans
is
elsie
within
yes
answered
hans
she
is
hereupon
she
was
terrified
and
said
ah
heavens
then
it
is
not
i
and
went
to
another
door
but
when
the
people
heard
the
jingling
of
the
bells
they
would
not
open
it
and
she
could
get
in
nowhere
then
she
ran
out
of
the
village
and
no
one
has
seen
her
since
illustration
the
bremen
a
certain
man
had
a
donkey
which
had
carried
the
to
the
mill
faithfully
for
many
a
long
year
but
his
strength
was
going
and
he
was
growing
more
and
more
unfit
for
work
then
his
master
began
to
consider
how
he
might
best
save
his
keep
but
the
donkey
seeing
that
no
good
wind
was
blowing
ran
away
and
set
out
on
the
road
to
bremen
there
he
thought
i
can
surely
be
when
he
had
walked
some
distance
he
found
a
hound
lying
on
the
road
gasping
like
one
who
had
run
till
he
was
tired
what
are
you
gasping
so
for
you
big
fellow
asked
the
donkey
ah
replied
the
hound
as
i
am
old
and
daily
grow
weaker
and
no
longer
can
hunt
my
master
wants
to
kill
me
so
i
have
taken
to
flight
but
now
how
am
i
to
earn
my
bread
i
tell
you
what
said
the
donkey
i
am
going
to
bremen
and
shall
be
there
come
with
me
and
engage
yourself
also
as
a
musician
i
will
play
the
lute
and
you
shall
beat
the
the
hound
agreed
and
on
they
went
before
long
they
came
to
a
cat
sitting
on
the
path
with
a
face
like
three
rainy
days
now
then
old
shaver
what
has
gone
askew
with
you
asked
the
donkey
who
can
be
merry
when
his
neck
is
in
danger
answered
the
cat
because
i
am
now
getting
old
and
my
teeth
are
worn
to
stumps
and
i
prefer
to
sit
by
the
fire
and
spin
rather
than
hunt
about
after
mice
my
mistress
wants
to
drown
me
so
i
have
run
away
but
now
good
advice
is
scarce
where
am
i
to
go
come
with
us
to
bremen
you
understand
so
you
can
be
a
the
cat
thought
well
of
it
and
went
with
them
after
this
the
three
fugitives
came
to
a
farmyard
where
the
cock
was
sitting
upon
the
gate
crowing
with
all
his
might
your
crow
goes
through
and
through
one
said
the
donkey
what
is
the
matter
i
have
been
foretelling
fine
weather
because
it
is
the
day
on
which
our
lady
washes
the
s
little
shirts
and
wants
to
dry
them
said
the
cock
but
guests
are
coming
for
sunday
so
the
housewife
has
no
pity
and
has
told
the
cook
that
she
intends
to
eat
me
in
the
soup
this
evening
i
am
to
have
my
head
cut
off
now
i
am
crowing
at
full
pitch
while
i
ah
but
said
the
donkey
you
had
better
come
away
with
us
we
are
going
to
bremen
you
can
find
something
better
than
death
everywhere
you
have
a
good
voice
and
if
we
make
music
together
it
must
have
some
quality
the
cock
agreed
to
this
plan
and
all
four
went
on
together
they
could
not
however
reach
the
city
of
bremen
in
one
day
and
in
the
evening
they
came
to
a
forest
where
they
meant
to
pass
the
night
the
donkey
and
the
hound
laid
themselves
down
under
a
large
tree
the
cat
and
the
cock
settled
themselves
in
the
branches
but
the
cock
flew
right
to
the
top
where
he
was
most
safe
before
he
went
to
sleep
he
looked
round
on
all
the
four
sides
and
thought
he
saw
in
the
distance
a
little
spark
burning
so
he
called
out
to
his
companions
that
there
must
be
a
house
not
far
off
for
he
saw
a
light
the
donkey
said
if
so
we
had
better
get
up
and
go
on
for
the
shelter
here
is
the
hound
thought
that
a
few
bones
with
some
meat
would
do
him
good
too
they
made
their
way
to
the
place
where
the
light
was
and
soon
saw
it
shine
brighter
and
grow
larger
until
they
came
to
a
robber
s
house
the
donkey
as
the
biggest
went
to
the
window
and
looked
in
what
do
you
see
my
asked
the
cock
what
do
i
see
answered
the
donkey
a
table
covered
with
good
things
to
eat
and
drink
and
robbers
sitting
at
it
enjoying
that
would
be
the
sort
of
thing
for
us
said
the
cock
yes
yes
ah
how
i
wish
we
were
there
said
the
donkey
then
the
animals
took
counsel
together
as
to
how
they
could
drive
away
the
robbers
and
at
last
they
thought
of
a
plan
the
donkey
was
to
place
himself
with
his
forefeet
upon
the
the
hound
was
to
jump
on
the
donkey
s
back
the
cat
was
to
climb
upon
the
hound
and
lastly
the
cock
was
to
fly
up
and
perch
upon
the
head
of
the
cat
when
this
was
done
at
a
given
signal
they
began
to
perform
their
music
together
the
donkey
brayed
the
hound
barked
the
cat
mewed
and
the
cock
crowed
then
they
burst
through
the
window
into
the
room
so
that
the
glass
clattered
at
this
horrible
din
the
robbers
sprang
up
thinking
no
otherwise
than
that
a
ghost
had
come
in
and
fled
in
a
great
fright
out
into
the
forest
the
four
companions
now
sat
down
at
the
table
well
content
with
what
was
left
and
ate
as
if
they
were
going
to
fast
for
a
month
as
soon
as
the
four
minstrels
had
done
they
put
out
the
light
and
each
sought
for
himself
a
according
to
his
nature
and
to
what
suited
him
the
donkey
laid
himself
down
upon
some
straw
in
the
yard
the
hound
behind
the
door
the
cat
upon
the
hearth
near
the
warm
ashes
and
the
cock
perched
himself
upon
a
beam
of
the
roof
being
tired
with
their
long
walk
they
soon
went
to
sleep
when
it
was
past
midnight
the
robbers
saw
from
afar
that
the
light
was
no
longer
burning
in
their
house
and
all
appeared
quiet
the
captain
said
we
ought
not
to
have
let
ourselves
be
frightened
out
of
our
wits
and
ordered
one
of
them
to
go
and
examine
the
house
the
messenger
finding
all
still
went
into
the
kitchen
to
light
a
candle
and
taking
the
glistening
fiery
eyes
of
the
cat
for
live
coals
he
held
a
to
them
to
light
it
but
the
cat
did
not
understand
the
joke
and
flew
in
his
face
spitting
and
scratching
he
was
dreadfully
frightened
and
ran
to
the
back
door
but
the
dog
who
lay
there
sprang
up
and
bit
his
leg
then
as
he
ran
across
the
yard
by
the
the
donkey
gave
him
a
smart
kick
with
his
hind
foot
the
cock
too
who
had
been
awakened
by
the
noise
and
had
become
lively
cried
down
from
the
beam
then
the
robber
ran
back
as
fast
as
he
could
to
his
captain
and
said
ah
there
is
a
horrible
witch
sitting
in
the
house
who
spat
on
me
and
scratched
my
face
with
her
long
claws
by
the
door
stands
a
man
with
a
knife
who
stabbed
me
in
the
leg
in
the
yard
there
lies
a
black
monster
who
beat
me
with
a
wooden
club
and
above
upon
the
roof
sits
the
judge
who
called
out
the
rogue
here
to
me
so
i
got
away
as
well
as
i
after
this
the
robbers
did
not
trust
themselves
in
the
house
again
but
it
suited
the
four
musicians
of
bremen
so
well
that
they
did
not
care
to
leave
it
any
more
and
the
mouth
of
him
who
last
told
this
story
is
still
warm
illustration
the
six
swans
once
upon
a
time
a
certain
king
was
hunting
in
a
great
forest
and
he
chased
a
wild
beast
so
eagerly
that
none
of
his
attendants
could
follow
him
when
evening
drew
near
he
stopped
and
looked
around
him
and
saw
that
he
had
lost
his
way
he
sought
a
way
out
but
could
find
none
then
he
perceived
an
old
woman
with
a
head
which
nodded
all
the
time
who
came
toward
him
but
she
was
a
witch
good
woman
said
he
to
her
can
you
not
show
me
the
way
through
the
forest
oh
yes
lord
king
she
answered
that
i
certainly
can
but
on
one
condition
and
if
you
do
not
fulfill
that
you
will
never
get
out
of
the
forest
and
will
die
of
hunger
in
what
kind
of
a
condition
is
it
asked
the
king
i
have
a
daughter
said
the
old
woman
who
is
as
beautiful
as
any
one
in
the
world
and
well
deserves
to
be
your
wife
if
you
will
make
her
your
queen
i
will
show
you
the
way
out
of
the
in
the
anguish
of
his
heart
the
king
consented
and
the
old
woman
led
him
to
her
little
hut
where
her
daughter
was
sitting
by
the
fire
she
received
the
king
as
if
she
had
been
expecting
him
he
saw
that
she
was
very
beautiful
but
still
she
did
not
please
him
and
he
could
not
look
at
her
without
secret
horror
after
he
had
taken
the
maiden
up
on
his
horse
the
old
woman
showed
him
the
way
and
the
king
reached
his
royal
palace
again
where
the
wedding
was
celebrated
the
king
had
already
been
married
once
and
had
by
his
first
wife
seven
children
six
boys
and
a
girl
whom
he
loved
better
than
anything
else
in
the
world
as
he
now
feared
that
the
new
queen
might
not
treat
them
well
and
even
do
them
some
injury
he
took
them
to
a
lonely
castle
which
stood
in
the
midst
of
a
forest
it
lay
concealed
and
the
way
was
so
difficult
to
find
that
he
himself
would
not
have
found
it
at
all
if
a
wise
woman
had
not
given
him
a
ball
of
yarn
with
wonderful
properties
when
he
threw
it
down
before
him
it
unrolled
itself
and
showed
him
his
path
the
king
however
went
so
frequently
to
visit
his
dear
children
that
the
queen
noticed
his
absence
she
was
curious
and
wanted
to
know
what
he
did
when
he
was
alone
in
the
forest
she
gave
a
great
deal
of
money
to
his
servants
and
they
betrayed
the
secret
to
her
and
told
her
likewise
of
the
ball
which
alone
could
point
out
the
way
and
now
she
knew
no
rest
until
she
had
learnt
where
the
king
kept
the
ball
of
yarn
then
she
made
little
shirts
of
white
silk
and
as
she
had
learnt
the
art
of
witchcraft
from
her
mother
she
sewed
a
charm
inside
them
and
one
day
when
the
king
had
ridden
forth
to
hunt
she
took
the
little
shirts
and
went
into
the
forest
and
the
ball
showed
her
the
way
the
children
who
saw
from
a
distance
that
some
one
was
approaching
thought
that
their
dear
father
was
coming
to
them
and
full
of
joy
ran
to
meet
him
then
she
threw
one
of
the
little
shirts
over
each
of
them
and
no
sooner
had
the
shirts
touched
their
bodies
than
they
were
changed
into
swans
and
flew
away
over
the
forest
the
queen
went
home
quite
delighted
and
thought
she
had
got
rid
of
all
the
children
but
the
girl
had
not
run
out
with
her
brothers
and
the
queen
knew
nothing
about
her
next
day
the
king
went
to
visit
his
children
but
found
no
one
but
the
little
girl
where
are
your
brothers
asked
the
king
alas
dear
father
she
answered
they
have
gone
away
and
left
me
alone
and
she
told
him
that
she
had
seen
from
her
little
window
how
her
brothers
had
flown
away
over
the
forest
in
the
shape
of
swans
and
she
showed
him
the
feathers
which
they
had
let
fall
in
the
courtyard
and
which
she
had
picked
up
the
king
mourned
but
he
did
not
think
that
the
queen
had
done
this
wicked
deed
and
as
he
feared
that
the
girl
also
would
be
stolen
from
him
he
wanted
to
take
her
away
but
she
was
afraid
of
the
queen
and
entreated
the
king
to
let
her
stay
just
one
night
more
in
the
the
poor
girl
thought
i
can
no
longer
remain
here
i
will
go
and
seek
my
and
when
night
came
she
ran
away
and
went
straight
into
the
forest
she
walked
the
whole
night
long
and
next
day
also
without
stopping
until
she
could
go
no
farther
for
weariness
then
she
saw
a
and
went
into
it
and
found
a
room
with
six
little
beds
she
did
not
venture
to
get
into
any
of
them
but
crept
under
one
and
lay
down
on
the
hard
ground
to
pass
the
night
there
just
before
sunset
she
heard
a
rustling
and
saw
six
swans
come
flying
in
at
the
window
they
alighted
on
the
ground
and
blew
at
each
other
and
blew
all
the
feathers
off
and
their
swan
s
skins
stripped
off
like
a
shirt
then
the
maiden
looked
at
them
and
recognized
her
brothers
she
rejoiced
and
crept
forth
from
beneath
the
bed
the
brothers
were
not
less
delighted
to
see
their
little
sister
but
their
joy
was
short
here
can
you
not
abide
they
said
to
her
this
is
a
shelter
for
robbers
if
they
come
home
and
find
you
they
will
kill
but
can
you
not
protect
me
asked
the
little
sister
no
they
replied
only
for
one
quarter
of
an
hour
each
evening
can
we
lay
aside
our
swan
s
skins
and
have
our
human
form
after
that
we
are
once
more
turned
into
the
little
sister
wept
and
said
can
you
not
be
set
free
alas
no
they
answered
the
conditions
are
too
hard
for
six
years
you
may
neither
speak
nor
laugh
and
in
that
time
you
must
sew
together
six
little
shirts
of
for
us
and
if
one
single
word
falls
from
your
lips
all
your
work
will
be
and
when
the
brothers
had
said
this
the
quarter
of
an
hour
was
over
and
they
flew
out
of
the
window
again
as
swans
illustration
the
princess
went
out
and
gathered
the
maiden
however
resolved
to
deliver
her
brothers
even
if
it
should
cost
her
her
life
she
left
the
hut
went
into
the
midst
of
the
forest
seated
herself
on
a
tree
and
there
passed
the
night
next
morning
she
went
out
and
gathered
and
began
to
sew
she
could
not
speak
to
any
one
and
she
had
no
wish
to
laugh
she
sat
there
and
looked
at
nothing
but
her
work
when
she
had
spent
a
long
time
there
it
came
to
pass
that
the
king
of
the
country
was
hunting
in
the
forest
and
his
huntsmen
came
to
the
tree
on
which
the
maiden
was
sitting
they
called
to
her
and
said
who
are
you
but
she
made
no
answer
come
down
to
us
said
they
we
will
not
do
you
any
she
only
shook
her
head
as
they
pressed
her
further
with
questions
she
threw
her
golden
necklace
down
to
them
and
thought
to
content
them
with
that
they
however
did
not
cease
and
then
she
threw
her
girdle
down
to
them
and
as
this
also
was
to
no
use
her
garters
and
little
by
little
everything
which
she
had
on
that
she
could
do
without
until
she
had
nothing
left
but
her
shift
the
huntsmen
however
did
not
let
themselves
be
turned
aside
by
that
but
climbed
the
tree
and
fetched
the
maiden
down
and
led
her
before
the
king
the
king
asked
who
are
you
what
are
you
doing
on
the
tree
but
she
did
not
answer
he
put
the
question
in
every
language
that
he
knew
but
she
remained
as
mute
as
a
fish
as
she
was
so
beautiful
the
king
s
heart
was
touched
and
he
was
smitten
with
a
great
love
for
her
he
put
his
mantle
on
her
took
her
before
him
on
his
horse
and
carried
her
to
his
castle
then
he
caused
her
to
be
dressed
in
rich
garments
and
she
shone
in
her
beauty
like
bright
daylight
but
no
word
could
be
drawn
from
her
he
placed
her
by
his
side
at
table
and
her
modest
bearing
and
courtesy
pleased
him
so
much
that
he
said
she
is
the
one
whom
i
wish
to
marry
and
no
other
woman
in
the
and
a
few
days
after
he
united
himself
to
her
the
king
however
had
a
wicked
mother
who
was
dissatisfied
with
his
marriage
and
spoke
ill
of
the
young
queen
who
knows
said
she
from
whence
comes
the
creature
who
can
t
speak
she
is
not
worthy
of
a
king
after
a
year
had
passed
when
the
queen
brought
her
first
child
into
the
world
the
old
woman
took
it
away
from
her
and
smeared
her
mouth
with
blood
as
she
slept
then
she
went
to
the
king
and
accused
the
queen
of
being
a
the
king
would
not
believe
it
and
would
not
suffer
any
one
to
do
her
injury
she
however
sat
continually
sewing
at
the
shirts
and
cared
for
nothing
else
the
next
time
when
she
again
bore
a
beautiful
boy
the
false
old
woman
used
the
same
treachery
but
the
king
could
not
bring
himself
to
believe
her
words
he
said
she
is
too
pious
and
good
to
do
anything
of
that
kind
if
she
were
not
dumb
and
could
defend
herself
her
innocence
would
come
to
but
when
the
old
woman
stole
away
the
child
for
the
third
time
and
accused
the
queen
who
did
not
utter
one
word
of
defense
the
king
could
do
no
otherwise
than
deliver
her
over
to
justice
and
she
was
sentenced
to
be
burned
when
the
day
came
for
the
sentence
to
be
executed
it
was
the
last
day
of
the
six
years
during
which
she
was
not
to
speak
or
laugh
and
she
had
delivered
her
dear
brothers
from
the
power
of
the
enchantment
the
six
shirts
were
ready
only
the
left
sleeve
of
the
sixth
was
wanting
when
therefore
she
was
led
to
the
stake
she
laid
the
shirts
on
her
arm
and
when
she
stood
on
high
and
the
fire
was
just
going
to
be
lighted
she
looked
around
and
six
swans
came
flying
through
the
air
toward
her
then
she
saw
that
her
deliverance
was
near
and
her
heart
leapt
with
joy
the
swans
swept
toward
her
and
sank
down
so
that
she
could
throw
the
shirts
over
them
and
as
they
were
touched
by
them
their
swan
s
skins
fell
off
and
her
brothers
stood
in
their
own
form
before
her
vigorous
and
handsome
the
youngest
lacked
only
his
left
arm
and
had
in
its
place
a
swan
s
wing
on
his
shoulder
they
embraced
and
kissed
each
other
and
the
queen
went
to
the
king
who
was
greatly
moved
and
she
began
to
speak
and
said
dearest
husband
now
i
may
speak
and
declare
to
you
that
i
am
innocent
and
falsely
and
she
told
him
of
the
treachery
of
the
old
woman
who
had
taken
away
her
three
children
and
hidden
them
to
the
great
joy
of
the
king
they
were
brought
back
and
as
a
punishment
the
wicked
woman
was
bound
to
the
stake
and
burned
to
ashes
but
the
king
and
the
queen
with
their
six
brothers
lived
many
years
in
happiness
and
peace
illustration
the
poor
miller
s
boy
and
the
cat
in
a
certain
mill
lived
an
old
miller
who
had
neither
wife
nor
child
three
apprentices
served
under
him
as
they
had
been
with
him
several
years
he
one
day
said
to
them
i
am
old
and
want
to
sit
in
the
go
out
and
whichsoever
of
you
brings
me
the
best
horse
to
him
will
i
give
the
mill
and
in
return
for
it
he
shall
take
care
of
me
till
my
the
third
of
the
boys
was
however
the
drudge
who
was
looked
on
as
foolish
by
the
others
they
begrudged
the
mill
to
him
and
afterward
he
would
not
have
it
then
all
three
went
out
together
and
when
they
came
to
the
village
the
two
said
to
stupid
hans
you
may
just
as
well
stay
here
as
long
as
you
live
you
will
never
get
a
hans
however
went
with
them
and
when
it
was
night
they
came
to
a
cave
in
which
they
lay
down
to
sleep
the
two
sharp
ones
waited
until
hans
had
fallen
asleep
then
they
got
up
and
went
away
leaving
him
where
he
was
they
thought
they
had
done
a
very
clever
thing
but
it
was
certain
to
turn
out
ill
for
them
when
the
sun
arose
and
hans
woke
up
he
was
lying
in
a
deep
cavern
he
looked
around
on
every
side
and
exclaimed
oh
alas
where
am
i
then
he
got
up
and
clambered
out
of
the
cave
into
the
forest
thinking
here
i
am
quite
alone
and
deserted
how
shall
i
obtain
a
horse
now
whilst
he
was
thus
walking
full
of
thought
he
met
a
small
which
said
quite
kindly
hans
where
are
you
going
alas
you
can
not
help
i
well
know
your
desire
said
the
cat
you
wish
to
have
a
beautiful
horse
come
with
me
and
be
my
faithful
servant
for
seven
years
and
then
i
will
give
you
a
horse
more
beautiful
than
any
you
have
ever
seen
in
your
whole
well
this
is
a
wonderful
cat
thought
hans
but
i
am
determined
to
see
if
she
is
telling
the
so
she
took
him
with
her
into
her
enchanted
castle
where
there
were
nothing
but
cats
who
were
her
servants
they
leapt
nimbly
upstairs
and
downstairs
and
were
merry
and
happy
in
the
evening
when
they
sat
down
to
dinner
three
of
them
had
to
make
music
one
played
the
bassoon
the
other
the
fiddle
and
the
third
put
the
trumpet
to
his
lips
and
blew
out
his
cheeks
as
much
as
he
possibly
could
when
they
had
dined
the
table
was
carried
away
and
the
cat
said
now
hans
come
and
dance
with
no
said
he
i
won
t
dance
with
a
pussy
cat
i
have
never
done
that
then
take
him
to
bed
said
she
to
the
cats
so
one
of
them
lighted
him
to
his
bedroom
one
pulled
his
shoes
off
one
his
stockings
and
at
last
one
of
them
blew
out
the
candle
next
morning
they
returned
and
helped
him
out
of
bed
one
put
his
stockings
on
for
him
one
tied
his
garters
one
brought
his
shoes
one
washed
him
and
one
dried
his
face
with
her
tail
that
feels
very
soft
said
hans
he
however
had
to
serve
the
cat
and
chop
some
wood
every
day
and
to
do
that
he
had
an
axe
of
silver
while
the
wedge
and
saw
were
of
silver
and
the
mallet
of
copper
so
he
chopped
the
wood
small
he
stayed
there
in
the
house
and
had
good
meat
and
drink
but
never
saw
any
one
but
the
and
her
servants
once
she
said
to
him
go
and
mow
my
meadow
and
dry
the
grass
and
gave
him
a
scythe
of
silver
and
a
whetstone
of
gold
but
bade
him
deliver
them
up
again
carefully
so
hans
went
thither
and
did
what
he
was
bidden
and
when
he
had
finished
the
work
he
carried
the
scythe
whetstone
and
hay
to
the
house
and
asked
if
it
was
not
yet
time
for
her
to
give
him
his
reward
no
said
the
cat
you
must
first
do
something
more
for
me
of
the
same
kind
there
is
timber
of
silver
carpenter
s
axe
square
and
everything
that
is
needful
all
of
silver
with
these
build
me
a
small
then
hans
built
the
small
house
and
said
that
he
had
now
done
everything
and
still
he
had
no
horse
nevertheless
the
seven
years
had
gone
by
with
him
as
if
they
were
six
months
the
cat
asked
him
if
he
would
like
to
see
her
horses
yes
said
hans
then
she
opened
the
door
of
the
small
house
and
when
she
had
opened
it
there
stood
twelve
horses
such
horses
so
bright
and
shining
that
his
heart
rejoiced
at
the
sight
of
them
and
now
she
gave
him
to
eat
and
to
drink
and
said
go
home
i
will
not
give
you
your
horse
to
take
away
with
you
but
in
three
days
time
i
will
follow
you
and
bring
so
hans
set
out
and
she
showed
him
the
way
to
the
mill
she
had
however
never
once
given
him
a
new
coat
and
he
had
been
obliged
to
keep
on
his
dirty
old
which
he
had
brought
with
him
and
which
during
the
seven
years
had
everywhere
become
too
small
for
him
when
he
reached
home
the
two
other
apprentices
were
there
again
and
each
of
them
certainly
had
brought
a
horse
with
him
but
one
of
them
was
blind
and
the
other
lame
they
asked
hans
where
his
horse
was
it
will
follow
me
in
three
days
then
they
laughed
and
said
indeed
stupid
hans
where
will
you
get
a
horse
it
will
be
a
fine
one
hans
went
into
the
parlor
but
the
miller
said
he
should
not
sit
down
to
table
for
he
was
so
ragged
and
torn
that
they
would
all
be
ashamed
of
him
if
any
one
came
in
so
they
gave
him
a
mouthful
of
food
outside
at
night
when
they
went
to
rest
the
two
others
would
not
let
him
have
a
bed
and
at
last
he
was
forced
to
creep
into
the
and
lie
down
on
a
little
hard
straw
in
the
morning
when
he
awoke
the
three
days
had
passed
and
a
coach
came
with
six
horses
and
they
shone
so
bright
that
it
was
delightful
to
see
them
and
a
servant
brought
a
seventh
as
well
which
was
for
the
poor
miller
s
boy
and
a
magnificent
princess
alighted
from
the
coach
and
went
into
the
mill
and
this
princess
was
the
little
whom
poor
hans
had
served
for
seven
years
she
asked
the
miller
where
the
miller
s
boy
and
drudge
was
then
the
miller
said
we
will
not
have
him
here
in
the
mill
he
is
so
ragged
he
is
lying
in
the
then
the
king
s
daughter
said
that
they
were
to
fetch
him
immediately
so
they
brought
him
and
he
had
to
hold
his
little
smock
together
to
cover
himself
her
servants
unpacked
splendid
garments
and
washed
him
and
dressed
him
and
when
it
was
done
no
king
could
have
looked
more
handsome
then
the
princess
desired
to
see
the
horses
which
the
other
apprentices
had
brought
home
with
them
one
of
them
was
blind
and
the
other
lame
so
she
ordered
her
servants
to
bring
the
seventh
horse
when
the
miller
saw
it
he
said
such
a
horse
as
that
had
never
before
entered
his
yard
and
that
is
for
the
third
miller
s
boy
said
she
then
he
must
have
the
mill
said
the
miller
but
the
princess
said
that
the
horse
was
for
himself
and
that
he
was
to
keep
his
mill
as
well
then
she
took
her
faithful
hans
set
him
in
the
coach
and
drove
away
with
him
they
first
drove
to
the
little
house
which
he
had
built
with
the
silver
tools
behold
it
was
a
great
castle
everything
inside
it
was
of
silver
and
gold
then
she
married
him
and
he
was
rich
so
rich
that
he
had
enough
for
all
the
rest
of
his
life
after
this
let
no
one
say
that
any
one
who
is
silly
can
never
become
a
person
of
importance
illustration
little
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
sweet
little
girl
who
was
loved
by
every
one
who
looked
at
her
and
most
of
all
by
her
grandmother
there
was
nothing
that
she
would
not
have
given
the
child
once
she
gave
her
a
little
cap
of
red
velvet
which
suited
her
so
well
that
she
would
not
wear
anything
else
so
she
was
always
called
little
one
day
her
mother
said
to
her
come
little
here
is
a
piece
of
cake
and
a
bottle
of
wine
take
them
to
your
grandmother
she
is
ill
and
weak
and
they
will
do
her
good
set
out
before
it
gets
hot
walk
nicely
and
quietly
do
not
run
off
the
path
or
you
may
fall
and
break
the
bottle
then
your
grandmother
will
get
nothing
when
you
go
into
her
room
don
t
forget
to
say
good
morning
and
don
t
stop
to
peep
into
every
corner
before
you
do
i
ll
take
great
care
said
little
to
her
mother
and
gave
her
hand
on
it
the
grandmother
lived
in
the
wood
half
an
hour
s
distance
from
the
village
and
just
as
little
entered
the
wood
a
wolf
met
her
did
not
know
what
a
wicked
creature
he
was
and
was
not
at
all
afraid
of
him
little
said
he
thank
you
kindly
whither
away
so
early
little
to
my
grandmother
what
have
you
got
in
your
apron
cake
and
wine
yesterday
was
so
poor
sick
grandmother
is
to
have
something
good
to
make
her
where
does
your
grandmother
live
little
a
good
quarter
of
an
hour
farther
on
in
the
wood
her
house
stands
under
the
three
large
the
are
just
below
you
surely
must
know
it
replied
little
the
wolf
thought
to
himself
what
a
tender
young
creature
what
a
nice
plump
mouthful
she
will
be
better
to
eat
than
the
old
woman
i
must
act
craftily
so
as
to
catch
he
walked
for
a
short
time
by
the
side
of
little
and
then
he
said
see
little
how
pretty
the
flowers
are
about
here
why
do
you
not
look
round
i
believe
too
that
you
do
not
hear
how
sweetly
the
little
birds
are
singing
you
walk
gravely
along
as
if
you
were
going
to
school
while
everything
else
in
the
wood
is
little
raised
her
eyes
and
when
she
saw
the
sunbeams
dancing
here
and
there
through
the
trees
and
pretty
flowers
growing
everywhere
she
thought
suppose
i
take
grandmother
a
fresh
nosegay
that
would
please
her
too
it
is
so
early
in
the
day
that
i
shall
still
get
there
in
good
and
so
she
ran
from
the
path
into
the
wood
to
look
for
flowers
and
whenever
she
had
picked
one
she
fancied
that
she
saw
a
still
prettier
one
farther
on
and
ran
after
it
and
thus
got
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
wood
meanwhile
the
wolf
ran
straight
to
the
grandmother
s
house
and
knocked
at
the
door
who
is
there
little
replied
the
wolf
she
is
bringing
cake
and
wine
open
the
lift
the
latch
called
out
the
grandmother
i
am
too
weak
and
can
not
get
the
wolf
lifted
the
latch
the
door
flew
open
and
without
saying
a
word
he
went
straight
to
the
grandmother
s
bed
and
devoured
her
then
he
put
on
her
clothes
dressed
himself
in
her
cap
laid
himself
in
bed
and
drew
the
curtains
little
however
had
been
running
about
picking
flowers
when
she
had
gathered
so
many
that
she
could
carry
no
more
she
remembered
her
grandmother
and
set
out
on
the
way
to
her
she
was
surprised
to
find
the
standing
open
and
when
she
went
into
the
room
she
had
such
a
strange
feeling
that
she
said
to
herself
oh
dear
how
uneasy
i
feel
and
at
other
times
i
like
being
with
grandmother
so
she
called
out
good
morning
but
received
no
answer
so
she
went
to
the
bed
and
drew
back
the
curtains
there
lay
her
grandmother
with
her
cap
pulled
far
over
her
face
and
looking
very
strange
oh
grandmother
she
said
what
big
ears
you
have
the
better
to
hear
you
with
my
child
was
the
reply
but
grandmother
what
big
eyes
you
have
she
said
the
better
to
see
you
with
my
but
grandmother
what
large
hands
you
have
the
better
to
hug
you
oh
but
grandmother
what
a
terrible
big
mouth
you
have
the
better
to
eat
you
with
and
scarcely
had
the
wolf
said
this
than
with
one
bound
he
was
out
of
bed
and
swallowed
up
when
the
wolf
had
satisfied
his
appetite
he
lay
down
again
in
the
bed
fell
asleep
and
began
to
snore
very
loud
the
huntsman
was
just
passing
the
house
and
thought
to
himself
how
the
old
woman
is
snoring
i
must
just
see
if
she
wants
so
he
went
into
the
room
and
when
he
came
to
the
bed
he
saw
the
wolf
lying
in
it
do
i
find
thee
here
thou
old
sinner
said
he
i
have
long
sought
thee
then
just
as
he
was
going
to
fire
at
him
it
occurred
to
him
that
the
wolf
might
have
devoured
the
grandmother
and
that
she
might
still
be
saved
so
he
did
not
fire
but
took
a
pair
of
scissors
and
began
to
cut
open
the
stomach
of
the
sleeping
wolf
when
he
had
made
two
snips
he
saw
the
little
shining
and
then
he
made
two
snips
more
and
the
little
girl
sprang
out
crying
ah
how
frightened
i
have
been
how
dark
it
was
inside
the
wolf
and
after
that
the
aged
grandmother
came
out
alive
also
but
scarcely
able
to
breathe
then
quickly
fetched
great
stones
with
which
they
filled
the
wolf
s
body
and
when
he
awoke
he
wanted
to
run
away
but
the
stones
were
so
heavy
that
he
tumbled
down
at
once
and
fell
dead
then
all
three
were
delighted
the
huntsman
drew
off
the
wolf
s
skin
and
went
home
with
it
the
grandmother
ate
the
cake
and
drank
the
wine
which
had
brought
and
grew
strong
again
but
thought
to
herself
as
long
as
i
live
i
will
never
leave
the
path
to
run
into
the
wood
when
my
mother
has
forbidden
me
to
do
illustration
king
thrushbeard
a
king
had
a
daughter
who
was
beautiful
beyond
all
measure
but
so
proud
and
haughty
withal
that
no
suitor
was
good
enough
for
her
she
sent
away
one
after
the
other
and
made
fun
of
them
as
well
once
the
king
gave
a
great
feast
and
invited
thereto
from
far
and
near
all
the
young
men
likely
to
marry
they
were
marshalled
in
a
row
according
to
their
rank
and
standing
first
came
the
kings
then
the
then
the
princes
the
earls
the
barons
and
the
gentry
then
the
king
s
daughter
was
led
through
the
ranks
but
to
every
one
she
had
some
objection
to
make
one
was
too
fat
the
she
said
another
was
too
tall
long
and
thin
has
little
the
third
was
too
short
short
and
thick
is
never
the
fourth
was
too
pale
as
pale
as
the
fifth
too
red
a
the
sixth
was
not
straight
enough
a
green
log
dried
behind
the
so
she
had
something
to
say
against
every
one
but
she
made
herself
especially
merry
over
a
good
king
who
stood
quite
high
up
in
the
row
and
whose
chin
had
grown
a
little
crooked
well
she
cried
and
laughed
he
has
a
chin
like
a
thrush
s
beak
and
from
that
time
he
got
the
name
of
king
thrushbeard
but
the
old
king
when
he
saw
that
his
daughter
did
nothing
but
mock
people
and
despised
all
the
suitors
who
were
gathered
there
was
very
angry
and
swore
that
she
should
have
for
her
husband
the
very
first
beggar
that
came
to
his
doors
a
few
days
afterward
a
fiddler
came
and
sang
beneath
the
windows
trying
to
earn
a
small
alms
when
the
king
heard
him
he
said
let
him
come
so
the
fiddler
came
up
in
his
dirty
ragged
clothes
and
sang
before
the
king
and
his
daughter
when
he
had
ended
he
asked
for
a
trifling
gift
the
king
said
your
song
has
pleased
me
so
well
that
i
will
give
you
my
daughter
there
to
the
king
s
daughter
shuddered
but
the
king
said
i
have
taken
an
oath
to
give
you
to
the
very
first
beggar
man
and
i
will
keep
all
she
could
say
was
in
vain
the
priest
was
brought
and
she
had
to
let
herself
be
wedded
to
the
fiddler
on
the
spot
when
that
was
done
the
king
said
now
it
is
not
proper
for
you
a
beggar
woman
to
stay
any
longer
in
my
palace
you
may
go
away
with
your
the
beggar
man
led
her
out
by
the
hand
and
she
was
obliged
to
go
away
on
foot
with
him
when
they
came
to
a
large
forest
she
asked
to
whom
does
that
beautiful
forest
belong
it
belongs
to
king
thrushbeard
if
you
had
taken
him
it
would
have
been
illustration
well
she
laughed
he
has
a
chin
like
a
thrush
s
beak
ah
unhappy
girl
that
i
am
if
i
had
but
taken
king
thrushbeard
afterward
they
came
to
a
meadow
and
she
asked
again
to
whom
does
this
beautiful
green
meadow
belong
it
belongs
to
king
thrushbeard
if
you
had
taken
him
it
would
have
been
ah
unhappy
girl
that
i
am
if
i
had
but
taken
king
thrushbeard
then
they
came
to
a
large
town
and
she
asked
again
to
whom
does
this
fine
large
town
belong
it
belongs
to
king
thrushbeard
if
you
had
taken
him
it
would
have
been
ah
unhappy
girl
that
i
am
if
i
had
but
taken
king
thrushbeard
it
does
not
please
me
said
the
fiddler
to
hear
you
always
wishing
for
another
husband
am
i
not
good
enough
for
you
at
last
they
came
to
a
very
little
hut
and
she
said
oh
goodness
what
a
small
house
to
whom
does
this
miserable
mean
hovel
belong
the
fiddler
answered
that
is
my
house
and
yours
where
we
shall
live
she
had
to
stoop
in
order
to
go
in
at
the
low
door
where
are
the
servants
said
the
king
s
daughter
what
servants
answered
the
beggar
man
you
must
do
what
you
wish
to
have
done
just
make
a
fire
at
once
and
set
on
water
to
cook
my
supper
i
am
quite
but
the
king
s
daughter
knew
nothing
about
lighting
fires
or
cooking
and
the
beggar
man
had
to
lend
a
hand
himself
to
get
anything
fairly
done
when
they
had
finished
their
scanty
meal
they
went
to
bed
but
he
forced
her
to
get
up
quite
early
in
the
morning
in
order
to
look
after
the
house
for
a
few
days
they
lived
in
this
way
as
well
as
might
be
and
ate
up
all
the
food
in
the
house
then
the
man
said
wife
we
can
not
go
on
any
longer
eating
and
drinking
here
and
earning
nothing
you
must
weave
he
went
out
cut
some
willows
and
brought
them
home
then
she
began
to
weave
but
the
tough
willows
wounded
her
delicate
hands
i
see
that
this
will
not
do
said
the
man
you
had
better
spin
perhaps
you
can
do
she
sat
down
and
tried
to
spin
but
the
hard
thread
soon
cut
her
soft
fingers
so
that
the
blood
ran
down
see
said
the
man
you
are
fit
for
no
sort
of
work
i
have
made
a
bad
bargain
with
you
now
i
will
try
to
earn
a
living
by
selling
pots
and
earthenware
you
must
sit
in
the
and
sell
the
alas
thought
she
if
any
of
the
people
from
my
father
s
kingdom
come
to
the
market
and
see
me
sitting
there
selling
how
they
will
mock
me
but
it
was
of
no
use
she
had
to
yield
unless
she
chose
to
die
of
hunger
for
the
first
time
she
succeeded
well
for
the
people
were
glad
to
buy
the
woman
s
wares
because
she
was
and
they
paid
her
what
she
asked
many
even
gave
her
the
money
and
left
the
pots
with
her
as
well
so
they
lived
on
what
she
had
earned
as
long
as
it
lasted
then
the
husband
bought
a
lot
of
new
crockery
with
this
she
sat
down
at
the
corner
of
the
and
set
it
around
her
ready
for
sale
but
suddenly
there
came
a
drunken
soldier
galloping
along
and
he
rode
right
amongst
the
pots
so
that
they
were
all
broken
into
a
thousand
bits
she
began
to
weep
and
did
not
know
what
to
do
for
fear
alas
what
will
happen
to
me
cried
she
what
will
my
husband
say
to
this
she
ran
home
and
told
him
of
the
misfortune
who
would
seat
herself
at
a
corner
of
the
with
crockery
said
the
man
leave
off
crying
i
see
very
well
that
you
can
not
do
ordinary
work
so
i
have
been
to
our
king
s
palace
and
have
asked
whether
they
can
not
find
a
place
for
a
they
have
promised
me
to
take
you
in
that
way
you
will
get
your
food
for
the
king
s
daughter
was
now
a
and
had
to
be
at
the
cook
s
beck
and
call
and
do
the
dirtiest
work
in
each
of
her
pockets
she
fastened
a
little
jar
in
which
she
took
home
her
share
of
the
leavings
and
upon
this
they
lived
it
happened
that
the
wedding
of
the
king
s
eldest
son
was
to
be
celebrated
so
the
poor
woman
went
up
and
placed
herself
by
the
door
of
the
hall
to
look
on
when
all
the
candles
were
lit
and
people
each
more
beautiful
than
the
other
entered
and
all
was
full
of
pomp
and
splendor
she
thought
of
her
lot
with
a
sad
heart
and
cursed
the
pride
and
haughtiness
which
had
humbled
her
and
brought
her
to
so
great
poverty
the
smell
of
the
delicious
dishes
which
were
being
taken
in
and
out
reached
her
and
now
and
then
the
servants
threw
her
a
few
morsels
these
she
put
in
her
jars
to
take
home
all
at
once
the
king
s
son
entered
clothed
in
velvet
and
silk
with
gold
chains
about
his
neck
and
when
he
saw
the
beautiful
woman
standing
by
the
door
he
seized
her
by
the
hand
and
would
have
danced
with
her
but
she
refused
and
shrank
back
with
fear
for
she
saw
that
it
was
king
thrushbeard
her
suitor
whom
she
had
driven
away
with
scorn
her
struggles
were
of
no
use
he
drew
her
into
the
hall
but
the
string
by
which
her
pockets
were
fastened
broke
the
pots
fell
down
the
soup
ran
out
and
the
scraps
were
scattered
all
around
and
when
the
people
saw
it
there
arose
laughter
and
derision
and
she
was
so
ashamed
that
she
would
rather
have
been
a
thousand
fathoms
below
ground
she
sprang
to
the
door
and
would
have
run
away
but
on
the
stairs
a
man
caught
her
and
brought
her
back
and
when
she
looked
at
him
it
was
king
thrushbeard
he
said
to
her
kindly
do
not
be
afraid
i
and
the
fiddler
who
has
been
living
with
you
in
that
wretched
hovel
are
one
for
love
of
you
i
disguised
myself
so
and
i
also
was
the
soldier
who
rode
through
your
crockery
this
was
all
done
to
humble
your
proud
spirit
and
to
punish
you
for
the
insolence
with
which
you
mocked
then
she
wept
bitterly
and
said
i
have
done
great
wrong
and
am
not
worthy
to
be
your
but
he
said
be
comforted
the
evil
days
are
past
now
we
will
celebrate
our
then
the
came
and
put
the
most
splendid
clothing
on
her
her
father
and
his
whole
court
arrived
and
wished
her
happiness
in
her
marriage
to
king
thrushbeard
and
the
joy
now
began
in
earnest
i
wish
you
and
i
had
been
there
too
illustration
the
there
was
once
a
poor
man
and
a
poor
woman
who
had
nothing
but
a
little
cottage
they
earned
their
bread
by
fishing
and
always
lived
from
hand
to
mouth
but
it
came
to
pass
one
day
when
the
man
was
sitting
by
the
waterside
and
casting
his
net
that
he
drew
out
a
fish
entirely
of
gold
as
he
was
looking
at
the
fish
full
of
astonishment
it
began
to
speak
and
said
hark
you
fisherman
if
you
will
throw
me
back
again
into
the
water
i
will
change
your
little
hut
into
a
splendid
then
the
fisherman
answered
of
what
use
is
a
castle
to
me
if
i
have
nothing
to
eat
the
gold
fish
continued
that
shall
be
taken
care
of
there
will
be
a
cupboard
in
the
castle
in
which
when
you
open
it
shall
be
dishes
of
the
most
delicate
meats
and
as
many
of
them
as
you
may
if
that
be
true
said
the
man
then
i
can
well
do
you
a
yes
said
the
fish
there
is
however
the
condition
that
you
shall
tell
no
one
in
the
world
whosoever
he
may
be
whence
your
good
luck
has
come
if
you
speak
but
one
single
word
all
will
be
then
the
man
threw
the
wonderful
fish
back
again
into
the
water
and
went
home
where
his
hovel
had
formerly
stood
now
stood
a
great
castle
he
opened
wide
his
eyes
entered
and
saw
his
wife
dressed
in
beautiful
clothes
sitting
in
a
splendid
room
she
was
quite
delighted
and
said
husband
how
has
all
this
come
to
pass
it
suits
me
very
yes
said
the
man
it
suits
me
too
but
i
am
frightfully
hungry
just
give
me
something
to
said
the
wife
but
i
have
got
nothing
and
don
t
know
where
to
find
anything
in
this
new
there
is
no
need
of
your
knowing
said
the
man
for
i
see
yonder
a
great
cupboard
just
unlock
when
she
opened
it
lo
there
stood
cakes
meat
fruit
wine
then
the
woman
cried
joyfully
what
more
can
you
want
my
dear
and
they
sat
down
and
ate
and
drank
together
when
they
had
had
enough
the
woman
said
but
husband
whence
come
all
these
riches
alas
answered
he
do
not
question
me
about
it
for
i
dare
not
tell
you
anything
if
i
disclose
it
to
any
one
then
all
our
good
fortune
will
very
good
said
she
if
i
am
not
to
know
anything
then
i
do
not
want
to
know
however
she
was
not
in
earnest
she
never
rested
day
or
night
and
she
goaded
her
husband
until
in
his
impatience
he
revealed
that
all
was
owing
to
a
wonderful
gold
fish
which
he
had
caught
and
to
which
in
return
he
had
given
its
liberty
and
as
soon
as
the
secret
was
out
the
splendid
castle
with
the
cupboard
immediately
disappeared
they
were
once
more
in
the
old
fisherman
s
hut
and
the
man
was
obliged
to
follow
his
former
trade
and
fish
but
fortune
would
so
have
it
that
he
once
more
drew
out
the
gold
fish
listen
said
the
fish
if
you
will
throw
me
back
into
the
water
again
i
will
once
more
give
you
the
castle
with
the
cupboard
full
of
roast
and
boiled
meats
only
be
firm
for
your
life
s
sake
don
t
reveal
from
whom
you
have
it
or
you
will
lose
it
all
again
i
will
take
good
care
answered
the
fisherman
and
threw
the
fish
back
into
the
water
now
at
home
everything
was
once
more
in
its
former
magnificence
the
wife
was
overjoyed
at
their
good
fortune
but
curiosity
left
her
no
peace
so
that
after
a
couple
of
days
she
began
to
ask
again
how
it
had
come
to
pass
and
how
he
had
managed
to
secure
it
the
man
kept
silence
for
a
short
time
but
at
last
she
made
him
so
angry
that
he
broke
out
and
betrayed
the
secret
in
an
instant
the
castle
disappeared
and
they
were
back
again
in
their
old
hut
now
you
have
got
what
you
want
said
he
and
we
can
gnaw
at
a
bare
bone
ah
said
the
woman
i
had
rather
have
no
riches
if
i
am
not
to
know
from
whom
they
come
then
i
have
no
the
man
went
back
to
fish
and
after
a
while
he
chanced
to
draw
out
the
gold
fish
for
a
third
time
listen
said
the
fish
i
see
very
well
that
i
am
fated
to
fall
into
your
hands
take
me
home
and
cut
me
into
six
pieces
give
your
wife
two
of
them
to
eat
two
to
your
horse
and
bury
two
of
them
in
the
ground
then
they
will
bring
you
a
the
fisherman
took
the
fish
home
with
him
and
did
as
it
had
bidden
him
it
came
to
pass
that
from
the
two
pieces
that
were
buried
in
the
ground
two
golden
lilies
sprang
up
that
the
horse
had
two
golden
foals
and
the
fisherman
s
wife
bore
two
children
who
were
made
entirely
of
gold
the
children
grew
up
became
tall
and
handsome
and
the
lilies
and
horses
grew
likewise
then
the
lads
said
father
we
want
to
mount
our
golden
steeds
and
travel
out
in
the
but
he
answered
sorrowfully
how
shall
i
bear
it
if
you
go
away
and
i
know
not
how
it
fares
with
you
then
they
said
the
two
golden
lilies
remain
here
by
them
you
may
see
how
it
is
with
us
if
they
are
fresh
then
we
are
in
health
if
they
are
withered
we
are
ill
if
they
perish
then
we
are
so
they
rode
forth
and
came
to
an
inn
in
which
were
many
people
they
perceived
the
and
began
to
laugh
and
jeer
when
one
of
them
heard
the
mocking
he
felt
ashamed
and
would
not
go
out
into
the
world
but
turned
back
and
went
home
again
to
his
father
but
the
other
rode
forward
and
reached
a
great
forest
illustration
the
maiden
said
i
will
be
true
to
you
your
life
long
as
he
was
about
to
enter
it
the
people
said
it
is
not
safe
for
you
to
ride
through
the
wood
is
full
of
robbers
who
would
treat
you
badly
you
will
fare
ill
when
they
see
that
you
are
all
of
gold
and
your
horse
likewise
they
will
assuredly
kill
but
he
would
not
allow
himself
to
be
frightened
and
said
i
must
and
will
ride
through
then
he
took
and
covered
himself
and
his
horse
with
them
so
that
the
gold
was
not
seen
and
rode
fearlessly
into
the
forest
when
he
had
ridden
onward
a
little
he
heard
a
rustling
in
the
bushes
and
heard
voices
speaking
together
from
one
side
came
cries
of
there
is
one
but
from
the
other
let
him
go
tis
an
idle
fellow
as
poor
and
bare
as
a
what
should
we
gain
from
him
so
the
rode
joyfully
through
the
forest
and
no
evil
befell
him
one
day
he
entered
a
village
wherein
he
saw
a
maiden
who
was
so
beautiful
that
he
did
not
believe
that
any
more
beautiful
than
she
existed
in
the
world
and
as
such
a
mighty
love
took
possession
of
him
he
went
up
to
her
and
said
i
love
you
with
my
whole
heart
will
you
be
my
wife
he
too
pleased
the
maiden
so
much
that
she
agreed
and
said
yes
i
will
be
your
wife
and
be
true
to
you
your
whole
life
they
were
married
then
just
as
they
were
in
the
greatest
happiness
home
came
the
father
of
the
bride
when
he
saw
that
his
daughter
s
wedding
was
being
celebrated
he
was
astonished
and
said
where
is
the
bridegroom
they
showed
him
the
who
however
still
wore
his
then
the
father
said
wrathfully
a
vagabond
shall
never
have
my
daughter
and
was
about
to
kill
him
then
the
bride
begged
as
hard
as
she
could
and
said
he
is
my
husband
and
i
love
him
with
all
my
heart
until
at
last
he
allowed
himself
to
be
appeased
nevertheless
the
idea
never
left
his
thoughts
so
that
next
morning
he
rose
early
wishing
to
see
whether
his
daughter
s
husband
was
a
common
ragged
beggar
but
when
he
peeped
in
he
saw
a
magnificent
golden
man
in
the
bed
and
the
lying
on
the
ground
then
he
went
back
and
thought
what
a
good
thing
it
was
that
i
restrained
my
anger
i
should
have
committed
a
great
but
the
dreamed
that
he
rode
out
to
the
chase
of
a
splendid
stag
and
when
he
awoke
in
the
morning
he
said
to
his
wife
i
must
go
out
she
was
uneasy
and
begged
him
to
stay
there
and
said
you
might
easily
meet
with
a
great
but
he
answered
i
must
and
will
thereupon
he
got
up
and
rode
forth
into
the
forest
it
was
not
long
before
a
fine
stag
crossed
his
path
exactly
according
to
his
dream
he
aimed
and
was
about
to
shoot
it
when
the
stag
ran
away
he
gave
chase
over
hedges
and
ditches
for
the
whole
day
without
feeling
tired
in
the
evening
the
stag
vanished
from
his
sight
and
when
the
looked
round
him
he
was
standing
before
a
little
house
wherein
was
a
witch
he
knocked
and
a
little
old
woman
came
out
and
asked
what
are
you
doing
so
late
in
the
midst
of
the
great
forest
have
you
not
seen
a
stag
yes
answered
she
i
know
the
stag
well
and
thereupon
a
little
dog
which
had
come
out
of
the
house
with
her
barked
at
the
man
violently
will
you
be
silent
you
odious
toad
said
he
or
i
will
shoot
you
then
the
witch
cried
out
in
a
passion
what
will
you
slay
my
little
dog
and
immediately
she
transformed
him
so
that
he
lay
like
a
stone
meanwhile
his
bride
awaited
him
in
vain
and
thought
that
which
i
so
greatly
dreaded
which
lay
so
heavily
on
my
heart
has
come
upon
him
but
at
home
the
other
brother
was
standing
by
the
when
one
of
them
suddenly
drooped
alas
said
he
my
brother
has
met
with
some
great
misfortune
i
must
away
to
see
if
i
can
possibly
rescue
then
he
mounted
his
golden
horse
and
rode
forth
and
entered
the
great
forest
where
his
brother
lay
turned
to
stone
the
old
witch
came
out
of
her
house
and
called
him
wishing
to
entrap
him
also
he
did
not
go
near
her
but
said
i
will
shoot
you
if
you
do
not
bring
my
brother
to
life
she
touched
the
stone
though
very
unwillingly
with
her
forefinger
then
he
was
immediately
restored
to
his
human
shape
the
two
rejoiced
when
they
saw
each
other
again
they
kissed
and
caressed
each
other
and
rode
away
together
out
of
the
forest
the
one
home
to
his
bride
the
other
to
his
father
the
father
then
said
i
knew
well
that
you
had
rescued
your
brother
for
the
golden
lily
suddenly
rose
up
and
blossomed
out
then
they
lived
happily
and
all
prospered
with
them
until
their
death
illustration
little
once
upon
a
time
in
the
middle
of
winter
when
the
flakes
of
snow
were
falling
like
feathers
from
the
sky
a
queen
sat
at
a
window
sewing
and
the
frame
of
the
window
was
made
of
black
ebony
and
whilst
she
was
sewing
and
looking
out
of
the
window
at
the
snow
she
pricked
her
finger
with
the
needle
and
three
drops
of
blood
fell
upon
the
snow
and
the
red
looked
pretty
upon
the
white
snow
and
she
thought
to
herself
would
that
i
had
a
child
as
white
as
snow
as
red
as
blood
and
as
black
as
the
wood
of
the
soon
after
that
she
had
a
little
daughter
who
was
as
white
as
snow
and
as
red
as
blood
and
her
hair
was
as
black
as
ebony
she
was
therefore
called
little
and
when
the
child
was
born
the
queen
died
after
a
year
had
passed
the
king
took
to
himself
another
wife
she
was
a
beautiful
woman
but
proud
and
haughty
and
she
could
not
bear
that
any
one
else
should
surpass
her
in
beauty
she
had
a
wonderful
and
when
she
stood
in
front
of
it
and
looked
at
herself
in
it
and
said
on
the
wall
who
in
this
land
is
the
fairest
of
all
the
answered
o
queen
art
the
fairest
of
all
then
she
was
satisfied
for
she
knew
that
the
spoke
the
truth
but
little
was
growing
up
and
grew
more
and
more
beautiful
when
she
was
seven
years
old
she
was
as
beautiful
as
the
day
and
more
beautiful
than
the
queen
herself
and
once
when
the
queen
asked
her
on
the
wall
who
in
this
land
is
the
fairest
of
all
it
answered
art
fairer
than
all
who
are
here
lady
queen
but
more
beautiful
still
is
i
then
the
queen
was
shocked
and
turned
yellow
and
green
with
envy
from
that
hour
whenever
she
looked
at
little
her
heart
heaved
in
her
breast
she
hated
the
maiden
so
much
and
envy
and
pride
grew
higher
and
higher
in
her
heart
like
a
weed
so
that
she
had
no
peace
day
or
night
she
called
a
huntsman
and
said
take
the
child
away
into
the
forest
i
will
no
longer
have
her
in
my
sight
kill
the
huntsman
obeyed
and
took
her
away
but
when
he
had
drawn
his
knife
and
was
about
to
pierce
little
s
innocent
heart
she
began
to
weep
and
said
ah
dear
huntsman
leave
me
my
life
i
will
run
away
into
the
wild
forest
and
never
come
home
and
as
she
was
so
beautiful
the
huntsman
had
pity
on
her
and
said
run
away
then
you
poor
the
wild
beasts
will
soon
have
devoured
you
thought
he
and
yet
it
seemed
as
if
a
stone
had
been
rolled
from
his
heart
since
it
was
no
longer
needful
for
him
to
kill
her
but
now
the
poor
child
was
all
alone
in
the
great
forest
and
so
terrified
that
she
looked
at
every
leaf
of
every
tree
and
did
not
know
what
to
do
then
she
began
to
run
and
ran
over
sharp
stones
and
through
thorns
and
the
wild
beasts
ran
past
her
but
did
her
no
harm
she
ran
as
long
as
her
feet
would
go
until
it
was
almost
evening
then
she
saw
a
little
cottage
and
went
into
it
to
rest
herself
everything
in
the
cottage
was
small
but
neater
and
cleaner
than
can
be
told
there
was
a
table
on
which
was
a
white
cover
and
seven
little
plates
and
on
each
plate
a
little
spoon
moreover
there
were
seven
little
knives
and
forks
and
seven
little
mugs
against
the
wall
stood
seven
little
beds
side
by
side
and
covered
with
counterpanes
little
was
so
hungry
and
thirsty
that
she
ate
some
vegetables
and
bread
from
each
plate
and
drank
a
drop
of
wine
out
of
each
mug
for
she
did
not
wish
to
take
all
from
one
only
then
as
she
was
so
tired
she
laid
herself
down
on
one
of
the
little
beds
but
none
of
them
suited
her
one
was
too
long
another
too
short
but
at
last
she
found
that
the
seventh
one
was
right
so
she
remained
in
it
said
a
prayer
and
went
to
sleep
when
it
was
quite
dark
the
owners
of
the
cottage
came
back
they
were
seven
dwarfs
who
dug
and
delved
in
the
mountains
for
ore
they
lit
their
seven
candles
and
as
it
was
now
light
within
the
cottage
they
saw
that
some
one
had
been
there
for
everything
was
not
in
the
same
order
in
which
they
had
left
it
the
first
said
who
has
been
sitting
on
my
chair
the
second
who
has
been
eating
off
my
plate
the
third
who
has
been
taking
some
of
my
bread
the
fourth
who
has
been
eating
my
vegetables
the
fifth
who
has
been
using
my
fork
the
sixth
who
has
been
cutting
with
my
knife
the
seventh
who
has
been
drinking
out
of
my
mug
then
the
first
looked
round
and
saw
that
there
was
a
little
hole
on
his
bed
and
he
said
who
has
been
getting
into
my
bed
the
others
came
up
and
each
called
out
somebody
has
been
lying
in
my
bed
but
the
seventh
when
he
looked
at
his
bed
saw
little
who
was
lying
fast
asleep
therein
and
he
called
the
others
who
came
running
up
and
they
cried
out
with
astonishment
and
brought
their
seven
little
candles
and
let
the
light
fall
on
little
oh
oh
cried
they
what
a
lovely
child
and
they
were
so
glad
that
they
did
not
wake
her
up
but
let
her
sleep
on
in
the
bed
and
the
seventh
dwarf
slept
with
his
companions
one
hour
with
each
and
so
got
through
the
night
the
next
morning
little
awoke
and
was
frightened
when
she
saw
the
seven
dwarfs
but
they
were
friendly
and
asked
her
what
her
name
was
my
name
is
little
she
answered
how
have
you
come
to
our
house
said
the
dwarfs
then
she
told
them
that
the
wicked
queen
had
wished
to
have
her
killed
but
that
the
huntsman
had
spared
her
life
and
that
she
had
run
for
the
whole
day
until
at
last
she
had
found
their
dwelling
the
dwarfs
said
if
you
will
take
care
of
our
house
cook
make
the
beds
wash
sew
and
knit
and
if
you
will
keep
everything
neat
and
clean
you
may
stay
with
us
and
you
shall
want
for
yes
said
little
with
all
my
heart
and
she
stayed
with
them
she
kept
the
house
in
order
for
them
in
the
mornings
they
went
to
the
mountains
and
looked
for
copper
and
gold
in
the
evenings
they
came
back
and
then
their
supper
had
to
be
ready
the
maiden
was
alone
the
whole
day
so
the
good
dwarfs
warned
her
and
said
beware
of
the
queen
she
will
soon
know
that
you
are
here
be
sure
to
let
no
one
come
but
the
queen
believing
that
little
was
dead
could
not
but
think
that
she
herself
was
again
the
first
and
most
beautiful
of
all
she
went
to
her
and
said
on
the
wall
who
in
this
land
is
the
fairest
of
all
and
the
glass
answered
queen
thou
art
fairest
of
all
i
see
but
over
the
hills
where
the
seven
dwarfs
dwell
little
is
alive
and
well
and
none
is
so
fair
as
then
she
was
astounded
for
she
knew
that
the
never
spoke
falsely
and
she
knew
that
the
huntsman
had
betrayed
her
for
that
little
was
still
alive
and
so
she
thought
and
thought
again
how
she
might
kill
her
for
so
long
as
she
herself
was
not
the
fairest
in
the
whole
land
envy
let
her
have
no
rest
and
when
she
had
at
last
thought
of
something
to
do
she
painted
her
face
and
dressed
herself
like
an
old
and
no
one
could
have
known
her
in
this
disguise
she
went
over
the
seven
mountains
to
the
seven
dwarfs
and
knocked
at
the
door
and
cried
pretty
things
to
sell
very
cheap
very
cheap
little
looked
out
at
the
window
and
called
my
dear
woman
what
have
you
to
sell
good
things
pretty
things
she
answered
of
all
colors
and
she
pulled
out
one
which
was
woven
of
silk
i
may
let
the
worthy
old
woman
in
thought
little
and
she
unbolted
the
door
and
bought
the
pretty
laces
child
said
the
old
woman
what
a
fright
you
look
come
i
will
lace
you
properly
for
little
had
no
suspicion
but
stood
before
her
and
let
herself
be
laced
with
the
new
laces
but
the
old
woman
laced
so
quickly
and
laced
so
tightly
that
little
lost
her
breath
and
fell
down
as
if
dead
now
i
am
the
most
beautiful
said
the
queen
to
herself
and
ran
away
not
long
afterward
in
the
evening
the
seven
dwarfs
came
home
but
how
shocked
they
were
when
they
saw
their
dear
little
lying
on
the
ground
and
that
she
neither
stirred
nor
moved
and
seemed
to
be
dead
they
lifted
her
up
and
as
they
saw
that
she
was
laced
too
tightly
they
cut
the
laces
than
she
began
to
breathe
a
little
and
after
a
while
came
to
life
again
when
the
dwarfs
heard
what
had
happened
they
said
the
old
was
no
one
else
than
the
wicked
queen
take
care
and
let
no
one
come
in
when
we
are
not
with
but
the
wicked
woman
when
she
had
reached
home
went
in
front
of
the
glass
and
asked
on
the
wall
who
in
this
land
is
the
fairest
of
all
and
it
answered
as
before
queen
thou
art
fairest
of
all
i
see
but
over
the
hills
where
the
seven
dwarfs
dwell
little
is
alive
and
well
and
none
is
so
fair
as
when
she
heard
that
all
her
blood
rushed
to
her
heart
with
fear
for
she
saw
plainly
that
little
was
again
alive
but
now
she
said
i
will
think
of
something
that
shall
put
an
end
to
you
and
by
the
help
of
witchcraft
which
she
understood
she
made
a
poisonous
comb
then
she
disguised
herself
and
took
the
shape
of
another
old
woman
so
she
went
over
the
seven
mountains
to
the
seven
dwarfs
knocked
at
the
door
and
cried
good
things
to
sell
cheap
cheap
little
looked
out
and
said
go
away
i
can
not
let
any
one
come
i
suppose
you
may
look
said
the
old
woman
and
pulled
the
poisonous
comb
out
and
held
it
up
it
pleased
the
maiden
so
well
that
she
let
herself
be
beguiled
and
opened
the
door
when
they
had
made
a
bargain
the
old
woman
said
now
i
will
comb
you
properly
for
poor
little
had
no
suspicion
and
let
the
old
woman
do
as
she
pleased
but
hardly
had
she
put
the
comb
in
her
hair
then
the
poison
in
it
took
effect
and
the
maiden
fell
down
senseless
you
paragon
of
beauty
said
the
wicked
woman
you
are
done
for
now
and
she
went
away
but
fortunately
it
was
almost
evening
and
the
seven
dwarfs
came
home
when
they
saw
little
lying
as
if
dead
upon
the
ground
they
at
once
suspected
the
queen
they
looked
and
found
the
poisoned
comb
scarcely
had
they
taken
it
out
when
little
came
to
herself
and
told
them
what
had
happened
then
they
warned
her
once
more
to
be
upon
her
guard
and
to
open
the
door
to
no
one
the
queen
at
home
went
in
front
of
the
glass
and
said
on
the
wall
who
in
this
land
is
the
fairest
of
all
then
it
answered
as
before
queen
thou
art
fairest
of
all
i
see
but
over
the
hills
where
the
seven
dwarfs
dwell
little
is
alive
and
well
and
none
is
so
fair
as
when
she
heard
the
glass
speak
thus
she
trembled
and
shook
with
rage
little
shall
die
she
cried
even
if
it
costs
me
my
life
thereupon
she
went
into
a
secret
lonely
room
where
no
one
ever
came
and
there
she
made
a
very
poisonous
apple
outside
it
looked
pretty
white
with
a
red
cheek
so
that
every
one
who
saw
it
longed
for
it
but
whoever
ate
a
piece
of
it
must
surely
die
when
the
apple
was
ready
she
painted
her
face
and
dressed
herself
as
a
countrywoman
and
so
she
went
over
the
seven
mountains
to
the
seven
dwarfs
she
knocked
at
the
door
little
put
her
head
out
of
the
window
and
said
i
can
not
let
any
one
in
the
seven
dwarfs
have
forbidden
it
is
all
the
same
to
me
answered
the
woman
i
shall
soon
get
rid
of
my
apples
there
i
will
give
you
no
said
little
i
dare
not
take
are
you
afraid
of
poison
said
the
old
woman
look
i
will
cut
the
apple
in
two
pieces
you
eat
the
red
cheek
and
i
will
eat
the
the
apple
was
so
cunningly
made
that
only
the
red
cheek
was
poisoned
little
longed
for
the
fine
apple
and
when
she
saw
that
the
woman
ate
part
of
it
she
could
resist
no
longer
and
stretched
out
her
hand
and
took
the
poisonous
half
but
hardly
had
she
a
bit
of
it
in
her
mouth
than
she
fell
down
dead
then
the
queen
looked
at
her
with
a
dreadful
look
and
laughed
aloud
and
said
white
as
snow
red
as
blood
black
as
this
time
the
dwarfs
can
not
wake
you
up
again
and
when
she
asked
of
the
at
home
on
the
wall
who
in
this
land
is
the
fairest
of
all
it
answered
at
last
queen
in
this
land
thou
art
fairest
of
then
her
envious
heart
had
rest
so
far
as
an
envious
heart
can
have
rest
the
dwarfs
when
they
came
home
in
the
evening
found
little
lying
upon
the
ground
she
breathed
no
longer
and
was
dead
they
lifted
her
up
looked
to
see
whether
they
could
find
anything
poisonous
unlaced
her
combed
her
hair
washed
her
with
water
and
wine
but
it
was
all
of
no
use
the
poor
child
was
dead
and
remained
dead
they
laid
her
upon
a
bier
and
all
seven
of
them
sat
round
it
and
wept
for
her
and
wept
three
days
long
then
they
were
going
to
bury
her
but
she
still
looked
as
if
she
was
living
and
still
had
her
pretty
red
cheeks
they
said
we
could
not
bury
her
in
the
dark
ground
and
they
had
a
transparent
coffin
of
glass
made
so
that
she
might
be
seen
from
all
sides
they
laid
her
in
it
and
wrote
her
name
upon
it
in
golden
letters
and
that
she
was
a
king
s
daughter
then
they
put
the
coffin
out
upon
the
mountain
and
one
of
them
always
stayed
by
it
to
watch
it
and
birds
came
too
and
wept
for
little
first
an
owl
then
a
raven
and
last
a
dove
and
now
little
lay
a
long
long
time
in
the
coffin
she
did
not
change
but
looked
as
if
she
were
asleep
for
she
was
as
white
as
snow
as
red
as
blood
and
her
hair
was
as
black
as
ebony
it
happened
however
that
a
king
s
son
came
into
the
forest
and
went
to
the
dwarfs
house
to
spend
the
night
he
saw
the
coffin
on
the
mountain
and
the
beautiful
little
within
it
and
read
what
was
written
upon
it
in
golden
letters
then
he
said
to
the
dwarfs
let
me
have
the
coffin
i
will
give
you
whatever
you
want
for
but
the
dwarfs
answered
we
will
not
part
with
it
for
all
the
gold
in
the
then
he
said
let
me
have
it
as
a
gift
for
i
can
not
live
without
seeing
little
i
will
honor
and
prize
her
as
my
dearest
possession
as
he
spoke
in
this
way
the
good
dwarfs
took
pity
upon
him
and
gave
him
the
coffin
and
now
the
king
s
son
had
it
carried
away
by
his
servants
on
their
shoulders
and
it
happened
that
they
stumbled
over
a
and
with
the
shock
the
poisonous
piece
of
apple
which
little
had
bitten
off
came
out
of
her
throat
and
before
long
she
opened
her
eyes
lifted
up
the
lid
of
the
coffin
sat
up
and
was
once
more
alive
oh
where
am
i
she
cried
the
king
s
son
full
of
joy
said
you
are
with
me
and
told
her
what
had
happened
and
said
i
love
you
more
than
everything
in
the
world
come
with
me
to
my
father
s
palace
you
shall
be
my
and
little
was
willing
and
went
with
him
and
their
wedding
was
held
with
great
show
and
splendor
but
the
wicked
queen
was
also
bidden
to
the
feast
when
she
had
arrayed
herself
in
beautiful
clothes
she
went
before
the
and
said
on
the
wall
who
in
this
land
is
the
fairest
of
all
the
glass
answered
queen
of
all
here
the
fairest
art
thou
but
the
young
queen
is
fairer
by
far
i
trow
then
the
wicked
woman
uttered
a
curse
and
was
so
wretched
so
utterly
wretched
that
she
knew
not
what
to
do
at
first
she
would
not
go
to
the
wedding
at
all
but
she
had
no
peace
and
must
go
to
see
the
young
queen
and
when
she
went
in
she
knew
little
and
she
stood
still
with
rage
and
fear
and
could
not
stir
but
iron
slippers
had
already
been
put
upon
the
fire
and
they
were
brought
in
with
tongs
and
set
before
her
then
she
was
forced
to
put
on
the
shoes
and
dance
until
she
dropped
down
dead
illustration
rumpelstiltskin
once
there
was
a
miller
who
was
poor
but
who
had
a
beautiful
daughter
now
it
happened
that
he
had
to
speak
to
the
king
and
in
order
to
make
himself
appear
important
he
said
to
him
i
have
a
daughter
who
can
spin
straw
into
the
king
said
to
the
miller
that
is
an
art
which
pleases
me
well
if
your
daughter
is
as
clever
as
you
say
bring
her
to
my
palace
and
i
will
try
what
she
can
and
when
the
girl
was
brought
to
him
he
took
her
into
a
room
which
was
quite
full
of
straw
gave
her
a
and
a
reel
and
said
now
set
to
work
if
by
morning
early
you
have
not
spun
this
straw
into
gold
you
must
thereupon
he
himself
locked
up
the
room
and
left
her
in
it
alone
so
there
sat
the
poor
miller
s
daughter
and
for
her
life
could
not
tell
what
to
do
she
had
no
idea
how
straw
could
be
spun
into
gold
and
she
grew
more
and
more
miserable
until
at
last
she
began
to
weep
but
all
at
once
the
door
opened
and
in
came
a
little
man
and
said
good
evening
mistress
miller
why
are
you
crying
so
alas
answered
the
girl
i
have
to
spin
straw
into
gold
and
i
do
not
know
how
to
do
what
will
you
give
me
said
the
little
man
if
i
do
it
for
you
my
necklace
said
the
girl
the
little
man
took
the
necklace
seated
himself
in
front
of
the
wheel
and
whirr
whirr
three
turns
and
the
reel
was
full
then
he
put
another
on
and
whirr
whirr
three
times
round
and
the
second
was
full
too
and
so
it
went
on
till
the
morning
when
all
the
straw
was
spun
and
all
the
reels
were
full
of
gold
by
daybreak
the
king
was
there
and
when
he
saw
the
gold
he
was
astonished
and
delighted
but
his
heart
became
only
more
greedy
he
had
the
miller
s
daughter
taken
into
another
room
full
of
straw
which
was
much
larger
and
commanded
her
to
spin
that
also
in
one
night
if
she
valued
her
life
the
girl
knew
not
how
to
help
herself
and
was
crying
when
the
door
again
opened
and
the
little
man
appeared
and
said
what
will
you
give
me
if
i
spin
the
straw
into
gold
for
you
the
ring
on
my
finger
answered
the
girl
the
little
man
took
the
ring
again
began
to
turn
the
wheel
and
by
morning
had
spun
all
the
straw
into
glittering
gold
the
king
rejoiced
beyond
measure
at
the
sight
but
still
he
had
not
gold
enough
he
had
the
miller
s
daughter
taken
into
a
still
larger
room
full
of
straw
and
said
you
must
spin
this
too
in
the
course
of
this
night
but
if
you
succeed
you
shall
be
my
even
if
she
be
a
miller
s
daughter
thought
he
i
could
not
find
a
richer
wife
in
the
whole
when
the
girl
was
alone
the
little
man
came
again
for
the
third
time
and
said
what
will
you
give
me
if
i
spin
the
straw
for
you
this
time
also
i
have
nothing
left
that
i
could
give
answered
the
girl
then
promise
me
if
you
should
become
queen
your
first
who
knows
whether
that
will
ever
happen
thought
the
miller
s
daughter
and
not
knowing
how
else
to
help
herself
in
this
difficulty
she
promised
the
little
man
what
he
wanted
and
for
that
he
once
more
span
the
straw
into
gold
and
when
the
king
came
in
the
morning
and
found
all
as
he
had
wished
he
took
her
in
marriage
and
the
pretty
miller
s
daughter
became
a
queen
a
year
after
she
had
a
beautiful
child
and
she
never
gave
a
thought
to
the
little
man
but
suddenly
he
came
into
her
room
and
said
now
give
me
what
you
the
queen
was
and
offered
the
little
man
all
the
riches
of
the
kingdom
if
he
would
leave
her
the
child
but
the
little
man
said
no
something
that
is
alive
is
dearer
to
me
than
all
the
treasures
in
the
then
the
queen
began
to
weep
and
cry
so
that
the
little
man
pitied
her
i
will
give
you
three
days
time
said
he
if
by
that
time
you
find
out
my
name
then
you
shall
keep
your
so
the
queen
thought
the
whole
night
of
all
the
names
that
she
had
ever
heard
and
she
sent
a
messenger
over
the
country
to
inquire
far
and
wide
for
any
other
names
there
might
be
when
the
little
man
came
the
next
day
she
began
with
melchior
balthazar
and
said
all
the
names
she
knew
one
after
another
but
to
every
one
the
little
man
said
that
is
not
my
on
the
second
day
she
had
inquiries
made
in
the
neighborhood
as
to
the
names
of
the
people
there
and
she
repeated
to
the
little
man
the
most
uncommon
and
curious
perhaps
your
name
is
or
or
but
he
always
answered
that
is
not
my
on
the
third
day
the
messenger
came
back
again
and
said
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
a
single
new
name
but
as
i
came
to
a
high
mountain
at
the
end
of
the
forest
where
the
fox
and
the
hare
bid
each
other
good
night
there
i
saw
a
little
house
before
the
house
a
fire
was
burning
and
round
about
the
fire
a
funny
little
man
was
jumping
he
hopped
upon
one
leg
and
shouted
i
brew
i
bake
and
next
i
shall
the
queen
s
child
take
ah
well
it
is
none
knows
the
same
that
rumpelstiltskin
is
my
name
you
may
think
how
glad
the
queen
was
when
she
heard
the
name
and
when
soon
afterward
the
little
man
came
in
and
asked
now
mistress
queen
what
is
my
name
she
said
is
your
name
is
your
name
perhaps
your
name
is
illustration
perhaps
said
she
your
name
is
rumpelstiltskin
the
devil
has
told
you
that
the
devil
has
told
you
that
cried
the
little
man
and
in
his
anger
he
stamped
his
right
foot
so
deep
into
the
earth
that
his
whole
leg
went
in
and
then
in
rage
he
pulled
at
his
left
leg
so
hard
with
both
hands
that
he
tore
himself
in
two
illustration
little
a
long
time
ago
there
were
a
king
and
queen
who
said
every
day
ah
if
only
we
had
a
child
but
they
never
had
one
but
it
happened
that
once
when
the
queen
was
bathing
a
frog
crept
out
of
the
water
on
to
the
land
and
said
to
her
your
wish
shall
be
fulfilled
before
a
year
has
gone
by
you
shall
have
a
what
the
frog
had
said
came
true
and
the
queen
had
a
little
girl
who
was
so
pretty
that
the
king
could
not
contain
himself
for
joy
and
ordered
a
great
feast
he
invited
not
only
his
kindred
friends
and
acquaintance
but
also
the
wise
women
in
order
that
they
might
be
kind
and
toward
the
child
there
were
thirteen
of
them
in
his
kingdom
but
as
he
had
only
twelve
golden
plates
for
them
to
eat
out
of
one
of
them
had
to
be
left
at
home
the
feast
was
held
with
all
manner
of
splendor
when
it
came
to
an
end
the
wise
women
bestowed
their
magic
gifts
upon
the
baby
one
gave
virtue
another
beauty
a
third
riches
and
so
on
with
everything
in
the
world
that
one
can
wish
for
when
eleven
of
them
had
made
their
promises
suddenly
the
thirteenth
came
in
she
wished
to
avenge
herself
for
not
having
been
invited
and
without
greeting
or
even
looking
at
any
one
she
cried
with
a
loud
voice
the
king
s
daughter
in
her
fifteenth
year
shall
prick
herself
with
a
spindle
and
fall
down
and
without
saying
a
word
more
she
turned
round
and
left
the
room
they
were
all
shocked
but
the
twelfth
whose
good
wish
still
remained
unspoken
came
forward
and
as
she
could
not
undo
the
evil
sentence
but
only
soften
it
she
said
it
shall
not
be
death
but
a
deep
sleep
of
a
hundred
years
into
which
the
princess
shall
the
king
who
wished
to
keep
his
dear
child
from
the
misfortune
gave
orders
that
every
spindle
in
the
whole
kingdom
should
be
burnt
meanwhile
the
gifts
of
the
wise
women
were
fulfilled
on
the
young
girl
for
she
was
so
beautiful
modest
sweet
tempered
and
wise
that
every
one
who
saw
her
was
bound
to
love
her
it
happened
that
on
the
very
day
when
she
was
fifteen
years
old
the
king
and
queen
were
not
at
home
and
the
maiden
was
left
in
the
palace
quite
alone
so
she
went
round
into
all
sorts
of
places
looked
into
rooms
and
bedchambers
just
as
she
liked
and
at
last
came
to
an
old
tower
she
climbed
up
the
narrow
and
reached
a
little
door
a
rusty
key
was
in
the
lock
and
when
she
turned
it
the
door
sprang
open
there
in
a
little
room
sat
an
old
woman
with
a
spindle
busily
spinning
flax
good
day
old
dame
said
the
king
s
daughter
what
are
you
doing
there
i
am
spinning
said
the
old
woman
and
nodded
her
head
what
sort
of
thing
is
that
which
rattles
round
so
merrily
said
the
maiden
and
she
took
the
spindle
and
wanted
to
spin
too
but
scarcely
had
she
touched
the
spindle
when
the
magic
decree
was
fulfilled
and
she
pricked
her
finger
with
it
and
in
the
very
moment
when
she
felt
the
prick
she
fell
down
upon
the
bed
that
stood
there
and
lay
in
a
deep
sleep
and
this
sleep
extended
over
the
whole
palace
the
king
and
queen
who
had
just
come
home
and
had
entered
the
great
hall
began
to
go
to
sleep
and
the
whole
of
the
court
with
them
the
horses
too
went
to
sleep
in
the
stable
the
dogs
in
the
yard
the
pigeons
upon
the
roof
the
flies
on
the
wall
even
the
fire
that
was
flaming
on
the
hearth
became
quiet
and
slept
the
roast
meat
left
off
frizzling
and
the
cook
who
was
just
going
to
pull
the
hair
of
the
scullery
boy
because
he
had
forgotten
something
let
him
go
and
went
to
sleep
and
the
wind
fell
and
on
the
trees
before
the
castle
not
a
leaf
moved
again
but
round
about
the
castle
there
began
to
grow
a
hedge
of
thorns
every
year
it
became
higher
and
at
last
grew
close
up
round
the
castle
and
all
over
it
so
that
there
was
nothing
of
it
to
be
seen
not
even
the
flag
upon
the
roof
but
the
story
of
the
beautiful
sleeping
for
so
the
princess
was
named
went
about
the
country
so
that
from
time
to
time
kings
sons
came
and
tried
to
get
through
the
thorny
hedge
into
the
castle
but
they
found
it
impossible
for
the
thorns
held
fast
together
as
if
they
had
hands
and
the
youths
were
caught
in
them
could
not
get
loose
again
and
died
a
miserable
death
after
long
long
years
again
a
king
s
son
came
to
that
country
he
heard
an
old
man
talking
about
the
and
that
a
castle
was
said
to
stand
behind
it
in
which
a
wonderfully
beautiful
princess
named
had
been
asleep
for
a
hundred
years
and
that
the
king
and
queen
and
the
whole
court
were
asleep
likewise
he
had
heard
too
from
his
grandfather
that
many
kings
sons
had
come
and
had
tried
to
get
through
the
thorny
hedge
but
they
had
remained
sticking
fast
in
it
so
had
died
a
pitiful
death
then
the
youth
said
i
am
not
afraid
i
will
go
and
see
the
beautiful
the
good
old
man
might
dissuade
him
as
he
would
he
did
not
listen
to
his
words
but
by
this
time
the
hundred
years
had
just
passed
the
day
was
come
when
was
to
awake
again
when
the
king
s
son
came
near
to
the
it
was
nothing
but
large
and
beautiful
flowers
which
parted
from
each
other
of
their
own
accord
and
let
him
pass
unhurt
then
they
closed
again
behind
him
like
a
hedge
in
the
he
saw
the
horses
and
the
spotted
hounds
lying
asleep
on
the
roof
sat
the
pigeons
with
their
heads
under
their
wings
and
when
he
entered
the
house
the
flies
were
asleep
upon
the
wall
the
cook
in
the
kitchen
was
still
holding
out
his
hand
to
seize
the
boy
and
the
maid
was
sitting
by
the
black
hen
which
she
was
going
to
pluck
he
went
on
farther
and
in
the
great
hall
he
saw
the
whole
of
the
court
lying
asleep
and
by
the
throne
lay
the
king
and
queen
then
he
went
on
still
farther
and
all
was
so
quiet
that
a
breath
could
be
heard
at
last
he
came
to
the
tower
and
opened
the
door
into
the
little
room
where
was
sleeping
there
she
lay
so
beautiful
that
he
could
not
turn
his
eyes
away
he
stooped
down
and
gave
her
a
kiss
but
as
soon
as
he
kissed
her
opened
her
eyes
and
awoke
and
looked
at
him
quite
sweetly
then
they
went
down
together
and
the
king
awoke
and
the
queen
and
the
whole
court
and
gazed
at
each
other
in
great
astonishment
and
the
horses
in
the
courtyard
stood
up
and
shook
themselves
the
hounds
jumped
up
and
wagged
their
tails
the
pigeons
upon
the
roof
pulled
out
their
heads
from
under
their
wings
looked
round
and
flew
into
the
open
country
the
flies
on
the
wall
crept
again
the
fire
in
the
kitchen
burned
up
and
flickered
and
cooked
the
meat
the
joint
began
to
turn
and
frizzle
and
the
cook
gave
the
boy
such
a
box
on
the
ear
that
he
screamed
and
the
maid
plucked
the
fowl
ready
for
the
spit
and
then
the
marriage
of
the
king
s
son
and
was
celebrated
with
all
splendor
and
they
lived
contented
to
the
end
of
their
days
illustration
the
three
little
men
in
the
wood
there
was
once
a
man
whose
wife
died
and
a
woman
whose
husband
died
and
the
man
had
a
daughter
and
the
woman
also
had
a
daughter
the
girls
were
acquainted
with
each
other
they
went
walking
together
and
came
to
the
woman
s
house
then
she
said
to
the
man
s
daughter
listen
tell
your
father
that
i
would
like
to
marry
him
then
you
shall
wash
yourself
in
milk
every
morning
and
drink
wine
but
my
own
daughter
shall
wash
herself
in
water
and
drink
the
girl
went
home
and
told
her
father
what
the
woman
had
said
the
man
said
what
shall
i
do
marriage
is
a
joy
also
a
torment
at
last
as
he
could
not
decide
he
pulled
off
his
boot
and
said
take
this
boot
it
has
a
hole
in
the
sole
of
it
go
with
it
upstairs
to
the
loft
hang
it
on
the
big
nail
then
pour
water
into
it
if
it
holds
the
water
then
i
will
again
take
a
wife
but
if
it
runs
through
i
will
not
the
girl
did
as
she
was
ordered
but
the
water
drew
the
hole
together
and
the
boot
became
full
to
the
top
she
informed
her
father
how
it
had
turned
out
then
he
himself
went
up
and
when
he
saw
that
she
was
right
he
went
to
the
widow
and
wooed
her
and
the
wedding
was
celebrated
the
next
morning
when
the
two
girls
got
up
there
stood
before
the
man
s
daughter
milk
for
her
to
wash
in
and
wine
for
her
to
drink
but
before
the
woman
s
daughter
stood
water
to
wash
herself
with
and
water
for
drinking
on
the
second
morning
stood
water
for
washing
and
water
for
drinking
before
the
man
s
daughter
as
well
as
before
the
woman
s
daughter
and
on
the
third
morning
stood
water
for
washing
and
water
for
drinking
before
the
man
s
daughter
and
milk
for
washing
and
wine
for
drinking
before
the
woman
s
daughter
and
so
it
continued
the
woman
became
bitterly
unkind
to
the
man
s
daughter
and
day
by
day
did
her
best
to
treat
her
still
worse
she
was
envious
too
because
the
man
s
daughter
was
beautiful
and
lovable
and
her
own
daughter
ugly
and
repulsive
one
day
in
winter
when
everything
was
frozen
as
hard
as
a
stone
and
hill
and
vale
lay
covered
with
snow
the
woman
made
a
frock
of
paper
called
the
man
s
daughter
and
said
here
put
on
this
dress
and
go
out
into
the
wood
and
fetch
me
a
little
basketful
of
strawberries
i
have
a
fancy
for
alas
said
the
girl
no
strawberries
grow
in
winter
the
ground
is
frozen
and
besides
the
snow
has
covered
everything
and
why
am
i
to
go
in
this
paper
frock
it
is
so
cold
outside
that
one
s
very
breath
freezes
the
wind
will
blow
through
the
frock
and
the
thorns
will
tear
it
off
my
will
you
contradict
me
again
said
the
woman
see
that
you
go
and
do
not
show
your
face
again
until
you
have
the
basketful
of
strawberries
then
she
gave
her
a
little
piece
of
hard
bread
and
said
this
will
last
you
the
day
and
thought
you
will
die
of
cold
and
hunger
outside
and
will
never
be
seen
again
by
then
the
girl
obeyed
and
put
on
the
paper
frock
and
went
out
with
the
basket
far
and
wide
there
was
nothing
but
snow
and
not
a
green
blade
to
be
seen
when
she
got
into
the
wood
she
saw
a
small
house
out
of
which
peeped
three
little
dwarfs
she
wished
them
good
day
and
knocked
modestly
at
the
door
they
cried
come
in
and
she
entered
the
room
and
seated
herself
on
the
bench
by
the
stove
where
she
began
to
warm
herself
and
eat
her
breakfast
the
dwarfs
said
give
us
some
of
willingly
said
she
and
divided
her
bit
of
bread
in
two
and
gave
them
the
half
they
asked
what
do
you
here
in
the
forest
in
the
winter
time
in
your
thin
dress
ah
she
answered
i
am
to
look
for
a
basketful
of
strawberries
and
am
not
to
go
home
until
i
can
take
them
with
when
she
had
eaten
her
bread
they
gave
her
a
broom
and
said
sweep
away
the
snow
at
the
back
door
with
but
when
she
was
outside
the
three
little
men
said
to
one
another
what
shall
we
give
her
as
she
is
so
good
and
has
shared
her
bread
with
us
then
said
the
first
my
gift
is
that
every
day
she
shall
grow
more
the
second
said
my
gift
is
that
gold
pieces
shall
fall
out
of
her
mouth
every
time
she
the
third
said
my
gift
is
that
a
king
shall
come
and
take
her
to
the
girl
however
did
as
the
little
men
had
bidden
her
swept
away
the
snow
behind
the
little
house
with
the
broom
and
what
did
she
find
but
real
ripe
strawberries
which
came
up
quite
out
of
the
snow
in
her
joy
she
hastily
gathered
her
basket
full
thanked
the
little
men
shook
hands
with
each
of
them
and
ran
home
to
take
the
woman
what
she
had
longed
for
so
much
when
she
went
in
and
said
a
piece
of
gold
at
once
fell
out
of
her
mouth
thereupon
she
related
what
had
happened
to
her
in
the
wood
but
with
every
word
she
spoke
gold
pieces
fell
from
her
mouth
until
very
soon
the
whole
room
was
covered
with
them
now
look
at
her
pride
cried
the
woman
s
daughter
to
throw
about
gold
in
that
way
but
she
was
secretly
envious
of
it
and
wanted
to
go
into
the
forest
to
seek
strawberries
her
mother
said
no
my
dear
little
daughter
it
is
too
cold
you
might
die
of
however
as
her
daughter
let
her
have
no
peace
the
mother
at
last
yielded
made
her
a
magnificent
dress
of
fur
which
she
was
obliged
to
put
on
and
gave
her
and
cake
to
take
with
her
the
girl
went
into
the
forest
and
straight
up
to
the
little
house
the
three
little
men
peeped
out
again
but
she
did
not
greet
them
without
looking
round
at
them
and
without
speaking
to
them
she
went
awkwardly
into
the
room
seated
herself
by
the
stove
and
began
to
eat
her
and
cake
give
us
some
of
it
cried
the
little
men
but
she
replied
there
is
not
enough
for
myself
so
how
can
i
give
it
away
to
other
people
when
she
had
done
eating
they
said
there
is
a
broom
for
you
sweep
all
clean
for
us
outside
by
the
humph
sweep
for
yourselves
she
answered
i
am
not
your
when
she
saw
that
they
were
not
going
to
give
her
anything
she
went
out
the
door
then
the
little
men
said
to
each
other
what
shall
we
give
her
as
she
is
so
naughty
and
has
a
wicked
envious
heart
that
will
never
let
her
do
a
good
turn
to
any
one
the
first
said
i
grant
that
she
may
grow
uglier
every
the
second
said
i
grant
that
at
every
word
she
says
a
toad
shall
spring
out
of
her
the
third
said
i
grant
that
she
may
die
a
miserable
the
maiden
looked
for
strawberries
outside
but
as
she
found
none
she
went
angrily
home
and
when
she
opened
her
mouth
and
was
about
to
tell
her
mother
what
had
happened
to
her
in
the
wood
with
each
word
she
said
a
toad
sprang
out
of
her
mouth
so
that
everybody
was
seized
with
horror
of
her
then
her
mother
was
still
more
enraged
and
thought
of
nothing
but
how
to
do
every
possible
injury
to
the
man
s
daughter
whose
beauty
however
grew
daily
greater
at
length
she
took
a
cauldron
set
it
on
the
fire
and
boiled
yarn
in
it
when
it
was
boiled
she
flung
it
on
the
poor
girl
s
shoulder
and
gave
her
an
axe
in
order
that
she
might
go
on
the
frozen
river
cut
a
hole
in
the
ice
and
rinse
the
yarn
she
was
obedient
went
thither
and
cut
a
hole
in
the
ice
and
while
she
was
in
the
midst
of
her
cutting
a
splendid
carriage
came
driving
up
in
which
sat
the
king
the
carriage
stopped
and
the
king
asked
my
child
who
are
you
and
what
are
you
doing
here
i
am
a
poor
girl
and
i
am
rinsing
then
the
king
felt
compassion
and
when
he
saw
that
she
was
so
very
beautiful
he
said
to
her
will
you
go
away
with
me
ah
yes
with
all
my
heart
she
answered
for
she
was
glad
to
get
away
from
the
mother
and
sister
so
she
got
into
the
carriage
and
drove
away
with
the
king
and
when
they
arrived
at
his
palace
the
wedding
was
celebrated
with
great
pomp
as
the
little
men
had
granted
to
the
maiden
illustration
the
golden
bird
in
the
olden
time
there
was
a
king
who
had
behind
his
palace
a
beautiful
in
which
there
was
a
tree
that
bore
golden
apples
when
the
apples
were
getting
ripe
they
were
counted
but
on
the
very
next
morning
one
was
missing
this
was
told
to
the
king
and
he
ordered
that
a
watch
should
be
kept
every
night
beneath
the
tree
the
king
had
three
sons
the
eldest
of
whom
he
sent
as
soon
as
night
came
into
the
garden
but
when
it
was
midnight
he
could
not
keep
himself
from
sleeping
and
next
morning
again
an
apple
was
gone
the
following
night
the
second
son
had
to
keep
watch
it
fared
no
better
with
him
as
soon
as
twelve
o
clock
had
struck
he
fell
asleep
and
in
the
morning
an
apple
was
gone
now
it
came
to
the
turn
of
the
third
son
to
watch
he
was
quite
ready
but
the
king
had
not
much
trust
in
him
and
thought
that
he
would
be
of
less
use
than
his
brothers
but
at
last
he
let
him
go
the
youth
lay
down
beneath
the
tree
but
kept
awake
and
did
not
let
sleep
master
him
when
it
struck
twelve
something
rustled
through
the
air
and
in
the
moonlight
he
saw
a
bird
coming
whose
feathers
were
shining
with
gold
the
bird
alighted
on
the
tree
and
had
just
plucked
off
an
apple
when
the
youth
shot
an
arrow
at
him
the
bird
flew
off
but
the
arrow
had
struck
his
plumage
and
one
of
his
golden
feathers
fell
down
the
youth
picked
it
up
and
the
next
morning
took
it
to
the
king
and
told
him
what
he
had
seen
in
the
night
the
king
called
his
council
together
and
every
one
declared
that
a
feather
like
this
was
worth
more
than
the
whole
kingdom
if
the
feather
is
so
precious
declared
the
king
one
alone
will
not
do
for
me
i
must
and
will
have
the
whole
bird
the
eldest
son
set
out
he
trusted
to
his
cleverness
and
thought
that
he
would
easily
find
the
golden
bird
when
he
had
gone
some
distance
he
saw
a
fox
sitting
at
the
edge
of
a
wood
so
he
cocked
his
gun
and
took
aim
at
him
the
fox
cried
do
not
shoot
me
and
in
return
i
will
give
you
some
good
counsel
you
are
on
the
way
to
the
golden
bird
this
evening
you
will
come
to
a
village
in
which
stand
two
inns
opposite
to
one
another
one
of
them
is
lighted
up
brightly
and
all
goes
on
merrily
within
but
do
not
enter
it
go
rather
into
the
other
even
though
it
seems
a
bad
how
can
such
a
silly
beast
give
wise
advice
thought
the
king
s
son
and
he
pulled
the
trigger
but
he
missed
the
fox
who
stretched
out
his
tail
and
ran
quickly
into
the
wood
so
he
pursued
his
way
and
by
evening
came
to
the
village
where
the
two
inns
were
in
one
they
were
singing
and
dancing
the
other
had
a
poor
miserable
look
illustration
in
the
moonlight
he
saw
a
bird
i
should
be
a
fool
indeed
he
thought
if
i
were
to
go
into
the
shabby
tavern
and
pass
by
the
good
so
he
went
into
the
cheerful
one
lived
there
in
riot
and
revel
and
forgot
the
bird
and
his
father
and
all
good
counsels
some
time
had
passed
and
when
the
eldest
son
month
after
month
did
not
come
home
the
second
set
out
wishing
to
find
the
golden
bird
the
fox
met
him
as
he
had
met
the
eldest
and
gave
him
the
good
advice
of
which
he
took
no
heed
he
came
to
the
two
inns
his
brother
was
standing
at
the
window
of
the
one
from
which
came
the
music
and
called
to
him
he
could
not
resist
but
went
inside
and
lived
only
for
pleasure
again
some
time
passed
and
then
the
youngest
king
s
son
wanted
to
set
off
and
try
his
luck
but
his
father
would
not
allow
it
it
is
of
no
use
said
he
he
will
be
less
likely
to
find
the
golden
bird
than
his
brothers
and
if
a
mishap
were
to
befall
him
he
knows
not
how
to
help
himself
he
is
a
little
wanting
at
the
but
at
last
as
he
had
no
peace
he
let
him
go
again
the
fox
was
sitting
outside
the
wood
and
begged
for
his
life
and
offered
his
good
advice
the
youth
was
and
said
be
easy
little
fox
i
will
do
you
no
you
shall
not
repent
it
answered
the
fox
and
that
you
may
proceed
more
quickly
get
up
behind
on
my
and
scarcely
had
he
seated
himself
when
the
fox
began
to
run
and
away
he
went
over
stock
and
stone
till
his
hair
whistled
in
the
wind
when
they
came
to
the
village
the
youth
got
off
he
followed
the
good
advice
and
without
looking
round
turned
into
the
little
inn
where
he
spent
the
night
quietly
the
next
morning
as
soon
as
he
got
into
the
open
country
there
sat
the
fox
already
and
said
i
will
tell
you
further
what
you
have
to
do
go
straight
forward
at
last
you
will
come
to
a
castle
in
front
of
which
a
whole
regiment
of
soldiers
is
lying
but
do
not
trouble
yourself
about
them
for
they
will
all
be
asleep
and
snoring
go
through
the
midst
of
them
straight
into
the
castle
go
through
all
the
rooms
till
at
last
you
will
come
to
a
chamber
where
a
golden
bird
is
hanging
in
a
wooden
cage
close
by
there
stands
an
empty
gold
cage
for
show
beware
of
taking
the
bird
out
of
the
common
cage
and
putting
it
into
the
fine
one
or
it
may
go
badly
with
with
these
words
the
fox
again
stretched
out
his
tail
and
the
king
s
son
seated
himself
upon
it
away
he
went
over
stock
and
stone
till
his
hair
whistled
in
the
wind
when
he
came
to
the
castle
he
found
everything
as
the
fox
had
said
the
king
s
son
went
into
the
chamber
where
the
golden
bird
was
shut
up
in
a
wooden
cage
whilst
a
golden
one
stood
hard
by
and
the
three
golden
apples
lay
about
the
room
but
thought
he
it
would
be
absurd
if
i
were
to
leave
the
beautiful
bird
in
the
common
and
ugly
cage
so
he
opened
the
door
laid
hold
of
it
and
put
it
into
the
golden
cage
but
at
the
same
moment
the
bird
uttered
a
shrill
cry
the
soldiers
awoke
rushed
in
and
took
him
off
to
prison
the
next
morning
he
was
taken
before
a
court
of
justice
and
as
he
confessed
everything
was
sentenced
to
death
the
king
however
said
that
he
would
grant
him
his
life
on
one
condition
namely
if
he
brought
him
the
golden
horse
which
ran
faster
than
the
wind
and
in
that
case
he
should
receive
over
and
above
as
a
reward
the
golden
bird
the
king
s
son
set
off
but
he
sighed
and
was
sorrowful
for
how
was
he
to
find
the
golden
horse
but
all
at
once
he
saw
his
old
friend
the
fox
sitting
on
the
road
look
you
said
the
fox
this
has
happened
because
you
did
not
give
heed
to
me
however
be
of
good
courage
i
will
help
you
and
tell
you
how
to
get
to
the
golden
horse
you
must
go
straight
on
and
you
will
come
to
a
castle
where
in
the
stable
stands
the
horse
the
grooms
will
be
lying
in
front
of
the
stable
they
will
be
asleep
and
snoring
and
you
can
quietly
lead
out
the
golden
horse
but
of
one
thing
you
must
take
heed
put
on
him
the
common
saddle
of
wood
and
leather
and
not
the
golden
one
which
hangs
close
by
else
it
will
go
ill
with
then
the
fox
stretched
out
his
tail
the
king
s
son
seated
himself
upon
it
away
he
went
over
stock
and
stone
until
his
hair
whistled
in
the
wind
everything
happened
just
as
the
fox
had
said
the
king
s
son
came
to
the
stable
in
which
the
golden
horse
was
standing
but
just
as
he
was
going
to
put
the
common
saddle
upon
him
he
thought
it
will
be
a
shame
to
such
a
beautiful
beast
if
i
do
not
give
him
the
good
saddle
which
belongs
to
him
by
but
scarcely
had
the
golden
saddle
touched
the
horse
than
he
began
to
neigh
loudly
the
grooms
awoke
seized
the
youth
and
threw
him
into
prison
the
next
morning
he
was
sentenced
by
the
court
to
death
but
the
king
promised
to
grant
him
his
life
and
the
golden
horse
as
well
if
he
would
rescue
the
beautiful
princess
from
the
golden
castle
with
a
heavy
heart
the
youth
set
out
yet
luckily
for
him
he
soon
found
the
trusty
fox
i
ought
to
leave
you
to
your
said
the
fox
but
i
pity
you
and
will
help
you
once
more
out
of
your
trouble
this
road
takes
you
straight
to
the
golden
castle
you
will
reach
it
by
eventide
and
at
night
when
everything
is
quiet
the
beautiful
princess
goes
to
the
to
bathe
when
she
enters
it
run
up
to
her
and
give
her
a
kiss
then
she
will
follow
you
and
you
can
take
her
away
with
you
only
do
not
allow
her
to
say
farewell
to
her
parents
first
or
it
will
go
ill
with
then
the
fox
stretched
out
his
tail
the
king
s
son
seated
himself
upon
it
away
the
fox
went
over
stock
and
stone
till
his
hair
whistled
in
the
wind
when
he
reached
the
golden
castle
it
was
just
as
the
fox
had
said
he
waited
until
midnight
when
everything
lay
in
deep
sleep
and
the
beautiful
princess
was
going
to
the
then
he
sprang
out
and
gave
her
a
kiss
she
said
that
she
would
like
to
go
with
him
but
she
asked
him
pitifully
and
with
tears
to
be
allowed
to
take
leave
of
her
parents
at
first
he
withstood
her
prayer
but
when
she
wept
more
and
more
and
fell
at
his
feet
he
at
last
gave
in
but
no
sooner
had
the
maiden
reached
the
bedside
of
her
father
than
he
and
all
the
rest
in
the
castle
awoke
and
the
youth
was
laid
hold
of
and
put
into
prison
the
next
morning
the
king
said
to
him
your
life
is
forfeited
and
you
can
only
find
mercy
if
you
take
away
the
hill
which
stands
in
front
of
my
windows
and
prevents
my
seeing
beyond
it
and
you
must
finish
it
all
within
eight
days
if
you
do
that
you
shall
have
my
daughter
as
your
the
king
s
son
began
and
dug
and
shovelled
without
leaving
off
but
after
seven
days
when
he
saw
how
little
he
had
done
and
how
all
his
work
was
as
good
as
nothing
he
fell
into
great
sorrow
and
gave
up
all
hope
on
the
evening
of
the
seventh
day
the
fox
appeared
and
said
you
do
not
deserve
that
i
should
take
any
trouble
about
you
nevertheless
go
away
and
lie
down
to
sleep
i
will
do
the
work
for
the
next
morning
when
he
awoke
and
looked
out
of
the
window
the
hill
had
gone
full
of
joy
the
youth
ran
to
the
king
and
told
him
that
the
task
was
fulfilled
and
whether
he
liked
it
or
not
the
king
had
to
hold
to
his
word
and
give
him
his
daughter
so
the
two
set
forth
together
and
it
was
not
long
before
the
trusty
fox
came
up
with
them
you
have
certainly
got
what
is
best
said
he
but
the
golden
horse
also
belongs
to
the
maiden
of
the
golden
how
shall
i
get
it
asked
the
youth
that
i
will
tell

the
fox
first

the
beautiful
maiden
to
the
king
who
sent
you
to
the
golden
castle
there
will
be
rejoicing
they
will
gladly
give
you
the
golden
horse
and
will
bring
it
out
to
all
was
brought
to
pass
successfully
and
the
king
s
son
carried
off
the
beautiful
princess
on
the
golden
horse
the
fox
did
not
remain
behind
and
he
said
to
the
youth
now
i
will
help
you
to
get
the
golden
bird
when
you
come
near
to
the
castle
where

golden
bird

to
be
found

maiden

and
i
will
take
her
into

golden
horse

be
great
rejoicing
at
the
sight
and
they
will
bring

the
golden
bird
for
when
all
was
accomplished
and
the
king
s
son
was
about
to
ride
home
with
his
treasures
the
fox
said
now

shall
reward
me
for
my
what
do
you
require
for
it
asked
the
youth
when
you
get
into
the
wood
yonder
shoot
me
dead
and
chop
off
my
head
and
that
would
be
fine
gratitude
said
the
king
s
son
i
can
not
possibly
do
that
for
the
fox
said
if
you
will
not
do
it
i
must
leave
you
but
before
i
go
away
i
will
give
you
a
piece
of
good
advice
be
careful
about
two
things
buy
no
gallows
and
do
not
sit
at
the
edge
of
any
and
then
he
ran
into
the
wood
the
youth
thought
that
is
a
wonderful
beast
he
has
strange
whims
who
is
going
to
buy
gallows
and
the
desire
to
sit
at
the
edge
of
a
well
has
never
yet
seized
he
rode
on
with
the
beautiful
maiden
and
his
road
took
him
again
through
the
village
in
which
his
two
brothers
had
remained
there
was
a
great
stir
and
noise
and
when
he
asked
what
was
going
on
he
was
told
that
two
men
were
going
to
be
hanged
as
he
came
nearer
to
the
place
he
saw
that
they
were
his
brothers
who
had
been
playing
all
kinds
of
wicked
pranks
and
had
squandered
their
entire
wealth
he
inquired
whether
they
could
not
be
set
free
if
you
will
pay
for
them
answered
the
people
but
why
should
you
waste
your
money
on
wicked
men
and
buy
them
free
he
did
not
think
twice
about
it
but
paid
for
them
and
when
they
were
set
free
they
all
went
on
their
way
together
they
came
to
the
wood
where
the
fox
had
first
met
them
and
as
it
was
cool
and
pleasant
within
it
whilst
the
sun
shone
hotly
the
two
brothers
said
let
us
rest
a
little
by
the
well
and
eat
and
he
agreed
and
whilst
they
were
talking
he
forgot
himself
and
sat
down
upon
the
edge
of
the
well
without
foreboding
any
evil
but
the
two
brothers
threw
him
backwards
into
the
well
took
the
maiden
the
horse
and
the
bird
and
went
home
to
their
father
here
we
bring
you
not
only
the
golden
bird
said
they
we
have
won
the
golden
horse
also
and
the
maiden
from
the
golden
then
was
there
great
joy
but
the
horse
would
not
eat
the
bird
would
not
sing
and
the
maiden
sat
and
wept
but
the
youngest
brother
was
not
dead
by
good
fortune
the
well
was
dry
and
he
fell
upon
soft
moss
without
being
hurt
but
he
could
not
get
out
again
even
in
this
strait
the
faithful
fox
did
not
leave
him
he
came
and
leapt
down
to
him
and
upbraided
him
for
having
forgotten
his
advice
but
yet
i
can
not
give
it
up
so
he
said
i
will
help
you
up
again
into
he
bade
him
grasp
his
tail
and
keep
tight
hold
of
it
and
then
he
pulled
him
up
you
are
not
out
of
all
danger
yet
said
the
fox
your
brothers
were
not
sure
of
your
death
and
have
surrounded
the
wood
with
watchers
who
are
to
kill
you
if
you
let
yourself
be
but
a
poor
man
was
sitting
upon
the
road
with
whom
the
youth
changed
clothes
and
in
this
way
he
got
to
the
king
s
palace
no
one
knew
him
but
the
bird
began
to
sing
the
horse
began
to
eat
and
the
beautiful
maiden
left
off
weeping
the
king
astonished
asked
what
does
this
mean
then
the
maiden
said
i
do
not
know
but
i
have
been
so
sorrowful
and
now
i
am
so
happy
i
feel
as
if
my
true
bridegroom
had
she
told
him
all
that
had
happened
although
the
other
brothers
had
threatened
her
with
death
if
she
were
to
betray
anything
the
king
commanded
that
all
people
who
were
in
his
castle
should
be
brought
before
him
and
amongst
them
came
the
youth
in
his
ragged
clothes
but
the
maiden
knew
him
at
once
and
fell
upon
his
neck
the
wicked
brothers
were
seized
and
put
to
death
but
he
was
married
to
the
beautiful
maiden
and
declared
heir
to
the
king
but
how
did
it
fare
with
the
poor
fox
long
afterward
the
king
s
son
was
once
again
walking
in
the
wood
when
the
fox
met
him
and
said
you
have
everything
now
that
you
can
wish
for
but
there
is
never
an
end
to
my
misery
and
yet
it
is
in
your
power
to
free
me
and
again
he
asked
him
with
tears
to
shoot
him
dead
and
to
chop
off
his
head
and
feet
so
he
did
it
and
scarcely
was
it
done
when
the
fox
was
changed
into
a
man
and
was
no
other
than
the
brother
of
the
beautiful
princess
who
at
last
was
freed
from
the
magic
charm
which
had
been
laid
upon
him
and
now
nothing
more
was
wanting
to
their
happiness
as
long
as
they
lived
illustration
the
queen
bee
two
king
s
sons
once
went
out
in
search
of
adventures
and
fell
into
a
wild
disorderly
way
of
living
so
that
they
never
came
home
again
the
youngest
who
was
called
simpleton
set
out
to
seek
his
brothers
when
at
length
he
found
them
they
mocked
him
for
thinking
that
he
with
his
simplicity
could
get
through
the
world
when
they
two
could
not
make
their
way
and
yet
were
so
much
cleverer
they
all
three
traveled
away
together
and
came
to
an
the
two
elder
wanted
to
destroy
it
to
see
the
little
ants
creeping
about
in
their
terror
carrying
their
eggs
away
but
simpleton
said
leave
the
creatures
in
peace
i
will
not
allow
you
to
disturb
then
they
went
farther
and
came
to
a
lake
on
which
a
great
number
of
ducks
were
swimming
the
two
brothers
wanted
to
catch
a
couple
and
roast
them
but
simpleton
would
not
permit
it
and
said
leave
the
creatures
in
peace
i
will
not
suffer
you
to
kill
at
length
they
came
to
a
bee
s
nest
in
which
there
was
so
much
honey
that
it
ran
out
of
the
trunk
of
the
tree
where
it
was
the
two
wanted
to
make
a
fire
under
the
tree
and
suffocate
the
bees
in
order
to
take
away
the
honey
but
simpleton
again
stopped
them
and
said
leave
the
creatures
in
peace
i
will
not
allow
you
to
burn
at
last
the
two
brothers
arrived
at
a
castle
where
stone
horses
were
standing
in
the
stables
and
no
human
being
was
to
be
seen
they
went
through
all
the
halls
until
they
came
to
a
door
in
which
were
three
locks
in
the
middle
of
the
door
there
was
a
little
pane
through
which
they
could
see
into
the
room
there
they
saw
a
little
gray
man
sitting
at
a
table
they
called
him
once
twice
but
he
did
not
hear
then
they
called
him
for
the
third
time
when
he
got
up
opened
the
locks
and
came
out
he
said
nothing
but
led
them
to
a
table
and
when
they
had
eaten
and
drunk
he
took
each
of
them
to
a
bedroom
next
morning
the
little
gray
man
came
to
the
eldest
beckoned
to
him
and
conducted
him
to
a
stone
table
on
which
were
inscribed
three
tasks
by
the
doing
of
which
the
castle
could
be
delivered
the
first
was
that
in
the
forest
beneath
the
moss
lay
the
princess
s
pearls
a
thousand
in
number
which
must
be
picked
up
and
if
by
sunset
one
single
pearl
was
wanting
he
who
had
looked
for
them
would
be
turned
to
stone
the
eldest
went
thither
and
sought
the
whole
day
but
when
it
came
to
an
end
he
had
found
only
one
hundred
and
what
was
written
on
the
table
came
to
pass
he
was
changed
into
stone
next
day
the
second
brother
undertook
the
adventure
it
did
not
however
fare
much
better
with
him
than
with
the
eldest
he
did
not
find
more
than
two
hundred
pearls
and
was
changed
to
stone
at
last
the
turn
came
to
simpleton
who
sought
in
the
moss
but
it
was
so
hard
to
find
the
pearls
and
he
got
on
so
slowly
that
he
seated
himself
on
a
stone
and
wept
and
while
he
was
thus
sitting
the
king
of
the
ants
whose
life
he
had
once
saved
came
with
five
thousand
ants
and
before
long
the
little
creatures
had
got
all
the
pearls
together
and
laid
them
in
a
heap
the
second
task
was
to
fetch
out
of
the
lake
the
key
of
the
king
s
daughter
s
bedchamber
when
simpleton
came
to
the
lake
the
ducks
which
he
had
saved
swam
up
to
him
dived
down
and
brought
the
key
out
of
the
water
but
the
third
task
was
the
most
difficult
from
amongst
the
three
sleeping
daughters
of
the
king
the
youngest
and
dearest
was
to
be
sought
out
they
resembled
each
other
exactly
and
were
only
to
be
distinguished
by
their
having
eaten
different
sweetmeats
before
they
fell
asleep
the
eldest
a
bit
of
sugar
the
second
a
little
syrup
and
the
youngest
a
spoonful
of
honey
then
the
queen
of
the
bees
which
simpleton
had
protected
from
the
fire
came
and
tasted
the
lips
of
all
three
at
last
she
remained
sitting
on
the
mouth
which
had
eaten
honey
and
thus
the
king
s
son
recognized
the
right
princess
then
the
enchantment
was
at
an
end
everything
was
released
from
sleep
and
those
who
had
been
turned
to
stone
received
once
more
their
natural
forms
simpleton
married
the
youngest
and
sweetest
princess
and
after
her
father
s
death
became
king
while
his
two
brothers
received
the
two
other
sisters
illustration
there
was
once
a
forester
who
went
into
the
forest
to
hunt
when
he
entered
it
he
heard
a
screaming
as
if
a
little
child
was
there
he
followed
the
sound
and
at
last
came
to
a
high
tree
in
the
top
of
it
a
little
child
was
sitting
his
mother
had
fallen
asleep
under
the
tree
with
the
child
and
a
bird
of
prey
had
seen
him
in
her
arms
flown
down
and
snatched
him
away
and
set
him
on
the
high
tree
the
forester
climbed
the
tree
and
brought
the
child
down
and
he
thought
to
himself
i
will
take
him
home
and
bring
him
up
with
my
he
took
him
home
and
the
two
children
grew
up
together
the
one
he
had
found
in
a
tree
he
called
because
a
bird
had
carried
it
away
and
lina
loved
each
other
so
dearly
that
when
they
did
not
see
each
other
they
were
sad
the
forester
however
had
an
old
cook
who
one
evening
took
two
pails
and
began
to
fetch
water
and
did
not
go
once
only
but
many
times
out
to
the
spring
lina
saw
this
and
said
hark
you
old
sanna
why
are
you
fetching
so
much
water
then
the
cook
said
early
morning
when
the
forester
is
out
hunting
i
will
heat
the
water
when
it
is
boiling
in
the
kettle
i
will
throw
in
and
will
boil
him
in
betimes
next
morning
the
forester
got
up
and
went
out
hunting
and
when
he
was
gone
the
children
were
still
in
bed
then
lina
said
to
if
you
will
never
leave
me
i
will
never
leave
said
neither
now
nor
ever
will
i
leave
then
said
lina
i
will
tell
you
last
night
old
sanna
carried
so
many
buckets
of
water
into
the
house
that
i
asked
her
why
she
was
doing
so
she
said
that
early
morning
when
father
was
out
hunting
she
would
set
on
the
kettle
full
of
water
throw
you
into
it
and
boil
you
but
we
will
get
up
quickly
dress
ourselves
and
go
away
the
two
children
therefore
got
up
dressed
themselves
quickly
and
went
away
when
the
water
in
the
kettle
was
boiling
the
cook
came
into
the
bedroom
to
fetch
and
throw
him
into
it
but
when
she
came
in
and
went
to
the
beds
both
the
children
were
gone
then
she
was
terribly
frightened
and
she
said
to
herself
what
shall
i
say
now
when
the
forester
comes
home
and
sees
that
the
children
are
gone
they
must
be
followed
instantly
and
brought
then
the
cook
sent
three
servants
after
them
who
were
to
run
and
overtake
the
children
the
children
however
were
sitting
outside
the
forest
and
when
they
saw
from
afar
the
three
servants
running
lina
said
to
never
leave
me
and
i
will
never
leave
said
neither
now
nor
then
said
lina
do
you
become
a
and
i
the
rose
upon
when
the
three
servants
came
to
the
forest
nothing
was
there
but
a
and
one
rose
on
it
the
children
were
nowhere
said
they
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
here
and
they
went
home
and
told
the
cook
that
they
had
seen
nothing
in
the
forest
but
a
little
with
one
rose
on
it
then
the
old
cook
scolded
and
said
you
simpletons
you
should
have
cut
the
in
two
and
have
broken
off
the
rose
and
brought
it
home
with
you
go
and
do
it
at
they
had
therefore
to
go
out
and
look
for
the
second
time
the
children
however
saw
them
coming
from
a
distance
then
lina
said
never
leave
me
and
i
will
never
leave
said
neither
now
nor
said
lina
then
do
you
become
a
church
and
i
ll
be
the
chandelier
in
so
when
the
three
servants
came
nothing
was
there
but
a
church
with
a
chandelier
in
it
they
said
therefore
to
each
other
what
can
we
do
here
let
us
go
when
they
got
home
the
cook
asked
if
they
had
not
found
them
they
said
no
they
had
found
nothing
but
a
church
and
that
there
was
a
chandelier
in
it
the
cook
scolded
them
and
said
you
fools
why
did
you
not
pull
the
church
to
pieces
and
bring
the
chandelier
home
with
you
and
now
the
old
cook
herself
got
on
her
legs
and
went
with
the
three
servants
in
pursuit
of
the
children
the
children
saw
from
afar
that
the
three
servants
were
coming
and
the
cook
waddling
after
them
then
said
lina
never
leave
me
and
i
will
never
leave
then
said
neither
now
nor
said
lina
be
a
fishpond
and
i
will
be
the
duck
upon
the
cook
however
came
up
to
them
and
when
she
saw
the
pond
she
lay
down
by
it
and
was
about
to
drink
it
up
when
she
fell
into
the
water
and
there
the
old
witch
had
to
drown
then
the
children
went
home
together
and
were
heartily
delighted
and
if
they
are
not
dead
they
are
living
still
illustration
the
golden
goose
there
was
a
man
who
had
three
sons
the
youngest
of
whom
was
called
dunderhead
and
was
despised
mocked
and
put
down
on
every
occasion
it
happened
that
the
eldest
wanted
to
go
into
the
forest
to
hew
wood
before
he
went
his
mother
gave
him
a
beautiful
sweet
cake
and
a
bottle
of
wine
that
he
might
not
suffer
from
hunger
or
thirst
when
he
entered
the
forest
there
met
him
a
little
old
gray
man
who
bade
him
and
said
do
give
me
a
piece
of
cake
out
of
your
pocket
and
let
me
have
a
draught
of
your
wine
i
am
so
hungry
and
but
the
prudent
youth
answered
if
i
give
you
my
cake
and
wine
i
shall
have
none
for
myself
be
off
with
you
and
he
left
the
little
man
standing
and
went
on
but
when
he
began
to
hew
down
a
tree
it
was
not
long
before
he
made
a
false
stroke
and
the
axe
cut
him
in
the
arm
so
he
had
to
go
home
and
have
it
bound
up
and
this
was
the
little
gray
man
s
doing
after
this
the
second
son
went
into
the
forest
and
his
mother
gave
him
like
the
eldest
a
cake
and
a
bottle
of
wine
the
little
old
gray
man
met
him
likewise
and
asked
him
for
a
piece
of
cake
and
a
drink
of
wine
but
the
second
son
too
said
with
much
reason
what
i
give
you
will
be
taken
away
from
myself
be
off
and
he
left
the
little
man
standing
and
went
on
his
punishment
however
was
not
delayed
when
he
had
made
a
few
strokes
at
the
tree
he
struck
himself
in
the
leg
so
he
had
to
be
carried
home
then
dunderhead
said
father
do
let
me
go
and
cut
the
father
answered
your
brothers
have
hurt
themselves
doing
so
leave
it
alone
you
do
not
understand
anything
about
but
dunderhead
begged
so
long
that
at
last
he
said
go
then
you
will
get
wiser
by
hurting
his
mother
gave
him
a
cake
made
with
water
and
baked
in
the
cinders
and
with
it
a
bottle
of
sour
beer
when
he
came
to
the
forest
the
little
old
gray
man
met
him
likewise
and
greeting
him
said
give
me
a
piece
of
your
cake
and
a
drink
out
of
your
bottle
i
am
so
hungry
and
dunderhead
answered
i
have
only
and
sour
beer
if
that
pleases
you
we
will
sit
down
and
so
they
sat
down
and
when
dunderhead
pulled
out
his
it
was
a
fine
sweet
cake
and
the
sour
beer
had
become
good
wine
so
they
ate
and
drank
and
after
that
the
little
man
said
since
you
have
a
good
heart
and
are
willing
to
divide
what
you
have
i
will
give
you
good
luck
there
stands
an
old
tree
cut
it
down
and
you
will
find
something
at
the
then
the
old
man
took
leave
of
him
dunderhead
went
and
cut
down
the
tree
and
when
it
fell
there
was
a
goose
sitting
in
the
roots
with
feathers
of
pure
gold
he
lifted
her
up
and
taking
her
with
him
went
to
an
inn
where
he
thought
he
would
stay
the
night
now
the
host
had
three
daughters
who
saw
the
goose
and
were
curious
to
know
what
such
a
wonderful
bird
might
be
and
each
wanted
one
of
its
feathers
the
eldest
thought
i
shall
soon
find
an
opportunity
of
pulling
out
a
feather
and
when
dunderhead
was
gone
out
she
seized
the
goose
by
the
wing
but
her
finger
and
hand
remained
sticking
fast
to
it
the
second
came
in
soon
afterward
thinking
only
of
how
she
might
get
a
feather
for
herself
but
she
had
scarcely
touched
her
sister
than
she
was
held
fast
at
last
the
third
came
with
the
like
intent
and
the
others
screamed
out
keep
away
for
goodness
sake
keep
away
but
she
did
not
understand
why
she
was
to
keep
away
the
others
are
there
she
thought
i
may
as
well
be
there
too
and
ran
to
them
but
as
soon
as
she
had
touched
her
sister
she
remained
sticking
fast
to
her
so
they
had
to
spend
the
night
with
the
goose
the
next
morning
dunderhead
took
the
goose
under
his
arm
and
set
out
without
troubling
himself
about
the
three
girls
who
were
hanging
on
to
it
they
were
obliged
to
run
after
him
now
left
now
right
just
as
he
was
inclined
to
go
in
the
middle
of
the
fields
the
parson
met
them
and
when
he
saw
the
procession
he
said
for
shame
you
girls
why
are
you
running
across
the
fields
after
this
young
man
is
that
seemly
at
the
same
time
he
seized
the
youngest
by
the
hand
in
order
to
pull
her
away
but
as
soon
as
he
touched
her
he
likewise
stuck
fast
and
was
obliged
to
run
behind
before
long
the
sexton
came
by
and
saw
his
master
the
parson
running
on
foot
behind
three
girls
he
was
astonished
at
this
and
called
out
hi
your
reverence
whither
away
so
quickly
do
not
forget
that
we
have
a
christening
and
running
after
him
he
took
him
by
the
sleeve
but
was
also
held
fast
while
the
five
were
trotting
thus
one
behind
the
other
two
laborers
came
with
their
hoes
from
the
fields
the
parson
called
out
to
them
and
begged
that
they
would
set
him
and
the
sexton
free
but
they
had
scarcely
touched
the
sexton
when
they
were
held
fast
and
now
there
were
seven
of
them
running
behind
dunderhead
and
the
goose
soon
afterward
he
came
to
a
city
where
a
king
ruled
who
had
a
daughter
who
was
so
serious
that
no
one
could
make
her
laugh
so
he
had
put
forth
a
decree
that
whosoever
should
make
her
laugh
should
marry
her
when
dunderhead
heard
this
he
went
with
his
goose
and
all
her
train
before
the
king
s
daughter
as
soon
as
she
saw
the
seven
people
running
on
and
on
one
behind
the
other
she
began
to
laugh
very
loudly
as
if
she
would
never
leave
off
thereupon
dunderhead
asked
to
have
her
for
his
wife
and
the
wedding
was
celebrated
after
the
king
s
death
dunderhead
inherited
the
kingdom
and
lived
a
long
time
contentedly
with
his
wife
illustration
mother
holle
there
was
once
a
widow
who
had
two
daughters
one
of
whom
was
beautiful
and
industrious
whilst
the
other
was
ugly
and
lazy
but
she
was
much
fonder
of
the
ugly
and
lazy
one
every
day
the
other
poor
girl
had
to
sit
by
a
well
in
the
highway
and
till
her
fingers
bled
now
it
happened
one
day
that
the
shuttle
was
stained
with
her
blood
she
dipped
it
in
the
well
to
wash
the
stains
off
and
it
dropped
out
of
her
hand
and
fell
to
the
bottom
she
began
to
weep
and
ran
to
the
woman
and
told
her
of
the
mishap
she
scolded
her
hard
and
was
so
cruel
as
to
say
since
you
have
let
the
shuttle
fall
in
you
must
fetch
it
out
so
the
girl
went
back
to
the
well
and
did
not
know
what
to
do
then
in
the
anguish
of
her
heart
she
jumped
into
the
well
to
get
the
shuttle
she
lost
her
senses
but
when
she
awoke
and
came
to
herself
she
was
in
a
lovely
meadow
where
the
sun
was
shining
and
thousands
of
flowers
were
growing
along
this
meadow
she
went
and
at
length
came
to
a
baker
s
oven
full
of
bread
and
the
bread
cried
take
me
out
take
me
out
or
i
shall
burn
i
am
well
baked
so
she
went
up
to
it
and
with
the
bread
shovel
took
out
all
the
loaves
one
after
the
other
after
that
she
went
on
till
she
came
to
a
tree
covered
with
apples
and
it
called
to
her
shake
me
shake
me
we
apples
are
all
ripe
so
she
shook
the
tree
till
the
apples
fell
like
rain
and
went
on
shaking
till
they
were
all
down
and
when
she
had
gathered
them
into
a
heap
she
went
on
her
way
at
last
she
came
to
a
little
house
out
of
which
an
old
woman
was
peeping
she
had
such
large
teeth
that
the
girl
was
frightened
and
was
about
to
run
away
but
the
old
woman
called
out
to
her
what
are
you
afraid
of
my
child
stay
with
me
if
you
will
do
the
work
in
my
house
carefully
you
shall
be
the
better
for
it
only
you
must
take
care
to
make
my
bed
well
and
to
shake
it
thoroughly
till
the
feathers
fly
for
then
it
snows
on
earth
i
am
mother
as
the
old
woman
spoke
so
kindly
to
her
the
girl
took
heart
and
willingly
entered
her
service
she
did
everything
to
the
old
woman
s
satisfaction
and
always
shook
her
bed
so
hard
that
the
feathers
flew
about
like
snowflakes
so
she
lived
happily
with
her
never
an
angry
word
and
boiled
or
roasted
meat
every
day
she
stayed
some
time
with
mother
holle
then
she
grew
sad
at
first
she
did
not
know
what
was
the
matter
with
her
but
by
and
by
she
found
that
it
was
homesickness
although
she
was
many
thousand
times
better
off
here
than
at
home
still
she
had
a
longing
to
be
there
at
last
she
said
to
the
old
woman
i
am
longing
for
home
however
well
off
i
am
down
here
i
can
not
stay
any
longer
i
must
go
up
again
to
my
own
mother
holle
said
i
am
pleased
that
you
long
for
your
home
again
you
have
served
me
so
faithfully
that
i
myself
will
take
you
up
thereupon
she
took
her
by
the
hand
and
led
her
to
a
large
door
the
door
was
opened
and
just
as
the
girl
was
standing
beneath
the
doorway
a
heavy
shower
of
fell
and
all
the
gold
stuck
to
her
so
that
she
was
covered
with
it
you
shall
have
that
because
you
are
so
industrious
said
mother
holle
and
at
the
same
time
she
gave
her
back
the
shuttle
which
she
had
let
fall
into
the
well
thereupon
the
door
closed
and
the
girl
found
herself
again
upon
the
earth
not
far
from
her
mother
s
house
as
she
went
into
the
yard
the
cock
was
standing
by
the
well
and
cried
your
golden
girl
s
came
back
to
you
so
she
went
into
her
mother
and
as
she
was
thus
covered
with
gold
she
was
welcomed
by
both
her
and
the
sister
illustration
a
heavy
shower
of
fell
the
girl
told
all
that
had
happened
to
her
as
soon
as
the
mother
heard
how
she
had
come
by
such
great
riches
she
was
anxious
for
the
same
good
fortune
to
befall
her
ugly
and
lazy
daughter
she
had
to
seat
herself
by
the
well
and
spin
and
in
order
that
her
shuttle
might
be
stained
with
blood
she
stuck
her
hand
into
a
and
pricked
her
finger
then
she
threw
her
shuttle
into
the
well
and
jumped
in
after
it
she
came
like
the
other
to
the
beautiful
meadow
and
walked
along
the
very
same
path
when
she
got
to
the
oven
the
bread
cried
again
take
me
out
take
me
out
or
i
shall
burn
i
am
well
baked
but
the
lazy
thing
answered
as
if
i
wanted
to
soil
myself
and
on
she
went
soon
she
came
to
the
which
cried
shake
me
shake
me
we
apples
are
all
ripe
but
she
answered
i
like
that
one
of
you
might
fall
on
my
head
and
on
she
went
when
she
came
to
mother
holle
s
house
she
was
not
afraid
for
she
had
already
heard
about
her
big
teeth
she
hired
herself
out
immediately
the
first
day
she
made
herself
work
diligently
and
obeyed
mother
holle
when
she
told
her
to
do
anything
for
she
was
thinking
of
all
the
gold
that
she
would
give
her
but
on
the
second
day
she
began
to
be
lazy
and
on
the
third
day
stall
more
so
for
then
she
would
not
get
up
in
the
morning
neither
did
she
make
mother
holle
s
bed
carefully
nor
shake
it
so
as
to
make
the
feathers
fly
up
mother
holle
was
soon
tired
of
this
and
gave
her
notice
to
leave
the
lazy
girl
was
willing
to
go
and
thought
that
now
the
would
come
mother
holle
led
her
to
the
great
doorway
but
while
she
was
standing
under
it
instead
of
gold
a
big
kettleful
of
pitch
was
emptied
over
her
that
is
the
reward
of
your
service
said
mother
holle
and
shut
the
door
so
the
lazy
girl
went
home
she
was
covered
with
pitch
and
the
cock
by
the
well
as
soon
as
he
saw
her
cried
out
your
pitchy
girl
s
come
back
to
you
but
the
pitch
stuck
fast
to
her
and
could
not
be
got
off
so
long
as
she
lived

the
two
travelers
hill
and
vale
do
not
come
together
but
the
children
of
men
do
good
and
bad
in
this
way
a
shoemaker
and
a
tailor
once
met
with
each
other
in
their
travels
the
tailor
was
a
handsome
little
fellow
who
was
always
merry
and
full
of
enjoyment
he
saw
the
shoemaker
coming
toward
him
from
the
other
side
and
as
he
observed
by
his
bag
what
kind
of
a
trade
he
plied
he
sang
a
little
mocking
song
to
him
me
the
seam

me
the
thread
spread
it
with
pitch
knock
the
nail
on
the
the
shoemaker
however
could
not
endure
a
joke
he
pulled
a
face
as
if
he
had
drunk
vinegar
and
made
a
gesture
as
if
he
were
about
to
seize
the
tailor
by
the
throat
but
the
little
fellow
began
to
laugh
reached
him
his
bottle
and
said
no
harm
was
meant
take
a
drink
and
swallow
your
anger
the
shoemaker
took
a
very
hearty
drink
and
the
storm
on
his
face
began
to
clear
away
he
gave
the
bottle
back
to
the
tailor
and
said
i
spoke
civilly
to
you
one
speaks
well
after
much
drinking
but
not
after
much
thirst
shall
we
travel
together
all
right
answered
the
tailor
if
only
it
suits
you
to
go
into
a
big
town
where
there
is
no
lack
of
that
is
just
where
i
want
to
go
answered
the
shoemaker
in
a
small
nest
there
is
nothing
to
earn
and
in
the
country
people
like
to
go
they
traveled
therefore
onward
together
and
always
set
one
foot
before
the
other
like
a
weazel
in
the
snow
both
of
them
had
time
enough
but
little
to
bite
and
to
break
when
they
reached
a
town
they
went
about
and
paid
their
respects
to
the
tradesmen
because
the
tailor
looked
so
lively
and
merry
and
had
such
pretty
red
cheeks
every
one
gave
him
work
willingly
and
when
luck
was
good
the
master
s
daughters
gave
him
a
kiss
beneath
the
porch
as
well
when
he
again
fell
in
with
the
shoemaker
the
tailor
had
always
the
most
in
his
bundle
the
shoemaker
made
a
wry
face
and
thought
the
greater
the
rascal
the
more
the
but
the
tailor
began
to
laugh
and
to
sing
and
shared
all
he
got
with
his
comrade
if
a
couple
of
pence
jingled
in
his
pockets
he
ordered
good
cheer
and
thumped
the
table
in
his
joy
till
the
glasses
danced
and
it
was
lightly
come
lightly
go
with
him
when
they
had
traveled
for
some
time
they
came
to
a
great
forest
through
which
passed
the
road
to
the
capital
two
however
led
through
it
one
of
them
a
seven
days
journey
and
the
other
only
two
but
neither
of
the
travelers
knew
which
way
was
the
short
one
they
seated
themselves
beneath
an
and
took
counsel
together
as
to
what
they
should
do
and
for
how
many
days
they
should
provide
themselves
with
bread
the
shoemaker
said
one
must
look
before
one
leaps
i
will
take
with
me
bread
for
a
what
said
the
tailor
drag
bread
for
seven
days
on
one
s
back
like
a
beast
of
burden
and
not
be
able
to
look
about
i
shall
trust
in
god
and
not
trouble
myself
about
anything
the
money
i
have
in
my
pocket
is
as
good
in
summer
as
in
winter
but
in
hot
weather
bread
gets
dry
and
mouldy
into
the
bargain
even
my
coat
does
not
go
as
far
as
it
might
besides
why
should
we
not
find
the
right
way
bread
for
two
days
and
that
s
each
therefore
bought
his
own
bread
and
then
they
tried
their
luck
in
the
forest
it
was
as
quiet
there
as
in
a
church
no
wind
stirred
no
brook
murmured
no
bird
sang
and
through
the
branches
no
sunbeam
forced
its
way
the
shoemaker
spoke
never
a
word
the
heavy
bread
weighed
down
his
back
until
the
perspiration
streamed
down
his
cross
and
gloomy
face
the
tailor
however
was
quite
merry
he
jumped
about
whistled
on
a
leaf
or
sang
a
song
and
thought
to
himself
god
in
heaven
must
be
pleased
to
see
me
so
this
lasted
two
days
but
on
the
third
the
forest
would
not
come
to
an
end
and
the
tailor
had
eaten
up
all
his
bread
so
after
all
his
heart
sank
down
a
yard
deeper
in
the
meantime
he
did
not
lose
courage
but
relied
on
god
and
on
his
luck
on
the
third
day
he
lay
down
in
the
evening
hungry
under
a
tree
and
rose
again
next
morning
hungry
still
so
also
passed
the
fourth
day
and
when
the
shoemaker
seated
himself
on
a
fallen
tree
and
devoured
his
dinner
the
tailor
was
only
a
if
he
begged
for
a
little
piece
of
bread
the
other
laughed
mockingly
and
said
you
have
always
been
so
merry
now
you
can
try
for
once
what
it
is
to
be
sad
the
birds
which
sing
too
early
in
the
morning
are
struck
by
the
hawk
in
the
evening
in
short
he
was
pitiless
but
on
the
fifth
morning
the
poor
tailor
could
no
longer
stand
up
and
was
hardly
able
to
utter
one
word
for
weakness
his
cheeks
were
white
and
his
eyes
red
then
the
shoemaker
said
to
him
i
will
give
you
a
bit
of
bread
but
in
return
for
it
i
will
put
out
your
right
the
unhappy
tailor
who
still
wished
to
save
his
life
could
not
do
it
in
any
other
way
he
wept
once
more
with
both
eyes
and
then
held
them
out
the
shoemaker
who
had
a
heart
of
stone
put
out
his
right
eye
with
a
sharp
knife
the
tailor
called
to
remembrance
what
his
mother
had
formerly
said
to
him
when
he
had
been
eating
secretly
in
the
pantry
eat
what
one
can
and
suffer
what
one
when
he
had
consumed
his
bread
he
got
on
his
legs
again
forgot
his
misery
and
comforted
himself
with
the
thought
that
he
could
always
see
enough
with
one
eye
but
on
the
sixth
day
hunger
made
itself
felt
again
and
gnawed
him
almost
to
the
heart
in
the
evening
he
fell
down
by
a
tree
and
on
the
seventh
morning
he
could
not
raise
himself
up
for
faintness
and
death
was
close
at
hand
then
said
the
shoemaker
i
will
show
mercy
and
give
you
bread
once
more
but
you
shall
not
have
it
for
nothing
i
shall
put
out
your
other
eye
for
and
now
the
tailor
felt
how
thoughtless
his
life
had
been
prayed
to
god
for
forgiveness
and
said
do
what
you
will
i
will
bear
what
i
must
but
remember
that
our
lord
god
does
not
always
look
on
passively
and
that
an
hour
will
come
when
the
evil
deed
which
you
have
done
to
me
and
which
i
have
not
deserved
of
you
will
be
requited
when
times
were
good
with
me
i
shared
what
i
had
with
you
my
trade
is
of
that
kind
that
each
stitch
must
always
be
exactly
like
the
other
if
i
no
longer
have
my
eyes
and
can
sew
no
more
i
must
go
at
any
rate
do
not
leave
me
here
alone
when
i
am
blind
or
i
shall
die
of
the
shoemaker
however
who
had
driven
god
out
of
his
heart
took
the
knife
and
put
out
his
left
eye
then
he
gave
him
a
bit
of
bread
to
eat
held
out
a
stick
to
him
and
drew
him
on
behind
him
when
the
sun
went
down
they
got
out
of
the
forest
and
before
them
in
the
open
country
stood
the
gallows
thither
the
shoemaker
guided
the
blind
tailor
and
then
left
him
alone
and
went
his
way
weariness
pain
and
hunger
made
the
wretched
man
fall
asleep
and
he
slept
the
whole
night
when
day
dawned
he
awoke
but
knew
not
where
he
lay
two
poor
sinners
were
hanging
on
the
gallows
and
a
crow
sat
on
the
head
of
each
of
them
then
one
of
the
men
who
had
been
hanged
began
to
speak
and
said
brother
are
you
awake
yes
i
am
awake
answered
the
second
then
i
will
tell
you
something
said
the
first
the
dew
which
this
night
has
fallen
down
over
us
from
the
gallows
gives
every
one
who
washes
himself
with
it
his
eyes
again
if
blind
people
did
but
know
this
how
many
would
regain
their
sight
who
do
not
believe
that
to
be
possible
when
the
tailor
heard
that
he
took
his
pressed
it
on
the
grass
and
when
it
was
moist
with
dew
washed
the
sockets
of
his
eyes
with
it
immediately
was
fulfilled
what
the
man
on
the
gallows
had
said
and
a
couple
of
healthy
new
eyes
filled
the
sockets
it
was
not
long
before
the
tailor
saw
the
sun
rise
behind
the
mountains
in
the
plain
before
him
lay
the
great
royal
city
with
its
magnificent
gates
and
hundred
towers
the
golden
balls
and
crosses
which
were
on
the
spires
began
to
shine
he
could
distinguish
every
leaf
on
the
trees
saw
the
birds
which
flew
past
and
the
midges
which
danced
in
the
air
he
took
a
needle
out
of
his
pocket
and
as
he
could
thread
it
as
well
as
ever
he
had
done
his
heart
danced
with
delight
he
threw
himself
on
his
knees
thanked
god
for
the
mercy
he
had
shown
him
and
said
his
morning
prayer
then
he
took
his
bundle
on
his
back
and
soon
forgot
the
pain
of
heart
he
had
endured
and
went
on
his
way
singing
and
whistling
the
first
thing
he
met
was
a
brown
foal
running
about
the
fields
at
large
he
caught
it
by
the
mane
and
wanted
to
spring
on
it
and
ride
into
the
town
the
foal
however
begged
to
be
set
free
i
am
still
too
young
it
said
even
a
light
tailor
such
as
you
are
would
break
my
back
in
two
let
me
go
till
i
have
grown
strong
a
time
may
come
when
i
can
reward
you
for
run
off
said
the
tailor
i
see
you
are
still
a
giddy
he
gave
it
a
touch
with
a
switch
over
its
back
whereupon
it
kicked
up
its
hind
legs
for
joy
leapt
over
hedges
and
ditches
and
galloped
away
into
the
open
country
but
the
little
tailor
had
eaten
nothing
since
the
day
before
the
sun
to
be
sure
fills
my
eyes
said
he
but
the
bread
does
not
fill
my
mouth
the
first
thing
that
comes
across
me
and
is
even
half
eatable
will
have
to
suffer
for
in
the
meantime
a
stork
stepped
solemnly
over
the
meadow
toward
him
halt
halt
cried
the
tailor
and
seized
him
by
the
leg
i
don
t
know
if
you
are
good
to
eat
or
not
but
my
hunger
leaves
me
no
great
choice
i
must
cut
your
head
off
and
roast
don
t
do
that
replied
the
stork
i
am
a
sacred
bird
which
brings
mankind
great
profit
and
no
one
ever
does
me
an
injury
leave
me
my
life
and
i
may
do
you
good
in
some
other
well
be
off
cousin
longlegs
said
the
tailor
the
stork
rose
up
let
its
long
legs
hang
down
and
flew
gently
away
what
s
to
be
the
end
of
this
said
the
tailor
to
himself
at
last
my
hunger
grows
greater
and
greater
and
my
stomach
more
and
more
empty
whatsoever
comes
in
my
way
now
is
at
this
moment
he
saw
a
couple
of
young
ducks
which
were
on
a
pond
come
swimming
toward
him
you
come
just
at
the
right
moment
said
he
and
laid
hold
of
one
of
them
and
was
about
to
wring
its
neck
on
this
an
old
duck
which
was
hidden
among
the
reeds
began
to
scream
loudly
and
swam
to
him
with
open
beak
and
begged
him
urgently
to
spare
her
dear
children
can
you
not
imagine
said
she
how
your
mother
would
mourn
if
any
one
wanted
to
carry
you
off
and
give
you
your
death
blow
only
be
quiet
said
the
tailor
you
shall
keep
your
children
and
he
put
the
prisoner
back
into
the
water
when
he
turned
round
he
was
standing
in
front
of
an
old
tree
which
was
partly
hollow
and
saw
some
wild
bees
flying
in
and
out
of
it
there
i
shall
at
once
find
the
reward
of
my
good
deed
said
the
tailor
the
honey
will
refresh
but
the
came
out
threatened
him
and
said
if
you
touch
my
people
and
destroy
my
nest
our
stings
shall
pierce
your
skin
like
ten
thousand
needles
but
if
you
will
leave
us
in
peace
and
go
your
way
we
will
do
you
a
service
for
it
another
the
little
tailor
saw
that
here
also
nothing
was
to
be
done
three
dishes
empty
and
nothing
on
the
fourth
is
a
bad
dinner
he
dragged
himself
therefore
with
his
stomach
into
the
town
it
was
just
striking
twelve
all
was
for
him
in
the
inn
and
he
was
able
to
sit
down
at
once
to
dinner
when
he
was
satisfied
he
said
now
i
will
get
to
he
went
round
the
town
sought
a
master
and
soon
found
a
good
situation
as
he
had
thoroughly
learned
his
trade
it
was
not
long
before
he
became
famous
and
every
one
wanted
to
have
a
new
coat
made
by
the
little
tailor
whose
importance
increased
daily
i
can
go
no
further
in
skill
said
he
and
yet
things
improve
every
at
last
the
king
appointed
him
but
how
things
do
happen
in
the
world
on
the
very
same
day
his
former
comrade
the
shoemaker
also
became
when
the
latter
caught
sight
of
the
tailor
and
saw
that
he
had
once
more
two
healthy
eyes
his
conscience
troubled
him
before
he
takes
revenge
on
me
thought
he
to
himself
i
must
dig
a
pit
for
he
however
who
digs
a
pit
for
another
falls
into
it
himself
in
the
evening
when
work
was
over
and
it
had
grown
dusk
he
stole
to
the
king
and
said
lord
king
the
tailor
is
an
arrogant
fellow
and
has
boasted
that
he
will
get
the
gold
crown
back
again
which
was
lost
in
ancient
that
would
please
me
very
much
said
the
king
he
caused
the
tailor
to
be
brought
before
him
next
morning
and
ordered
him
to
get
the
crown
back
again
or
to
leave
the
town
for
ever
oho
thought
the
tailor
a
rogue
gives
more
than
he
has
got
if
the
surly
king
wants
me
to
do
what
can
be
done
by
no
one
i
will
not
wait
till
morning
but
will
go
out
of
the
town
at
once
he
packed
up
his
bundle
but
when
he
was
without
the
gate
he
could
not
help
being
sorry
to
give
up
his
good
fortune
and
turn
his
back
on
the
town
in
which
all
had
gone
so
well
with
him
he
came
to
the
pond
where
he
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
ducks
at
that
very
moment
the
old
one
whose
young
ones
he
had
spared
was
sitting
there
by
the
shore
pluming
herself
with
her
beak
she
knew
him
again
and
asked
why
he
was
hanging
his
head
you
will
not
be
surprised
when
you
hear
what
has
befallen
me
replied
the
tailor
and
told
her
his
fate
if
that
be
all
said
the
duck
we
can
help
you
the
crown
fell
into
the
water
and
lies
at
the
bottom
we
will
soon
bring
it
up
again
for
you
in
the
meantime
just
spread
out
your
handkerchief
on
the
she
dived
down
with
her
twelve
young
ones
and
in
five
minutes
she
was
up
again
with
the
crown
resting
on
her
wings
the
twelve
young
ones
were
swimming
round
about
and
had
put
their
beaks
under
it
and
were
helping
to
carry
it
they
all
swam
to
the
shore
and
put
the
crown
on
the
handkerchief
no
one
can
imagine
how
magnificent
the
crown
was
when
the
sun
shone
on
it
it
gleamed
like
a
hundred
thousand
carbuncles
the
tailor
tied
his
handkerchief
together
by
the
four
corners
and
carried
it
to
the
king
who
was
full
of
joy
and
put
a
gold
chain
round
the
tailor
s
neck
when
the
shoemaker
saw
that
one
stroke
had
failed
he
contrived
a
second
and
went
to
the
king
and
said
lord
king
the
tailor
has
become
insolent
again
he
boasts
that
he
will
copy
in
wax
the
whole
of
the
royal
palace
with
everything
that
pertains
to
it
loose
or
fast
inside
and
the
king
sent
for
the
tailor
and
ordered
him
to
copy
in
wax
the
whole
of
the
royal
palace
with
everything
that
pertained
to
it
movable
or
immovable
within
and
without
and
if
he
did
not
succeed
in
doing
this
or
if
so
much
as
one
nail
on
the
wall
were
wanting
he
should
be
imprisoned
for
his
whole
life
underground
the
tailor
thought
it
gets
worse
and
worse
no
one
can
endure
that
and
threw
his
bundle
on
his
back
and
went
forth
when
he
came
to
the
hollow
tree
he
sat
down
and
hung
his
head
the
bees
came
flying
out
and
the
asked
him
if
he
had
a
stiff
neck
since
he
held
his
head
so
awry
alas
no
answered
the
tailor
something
quite
different
weighs
me
down
and
he
told
her
what
the
king
had
demanded
of
him
the
bees
began
to
buzz
and
hum
amongst
themselves
and
the
said
just
go
home
again
but
come
back
at
this
time
and
bring
a
large
sheet
with
you
and
then
all
will
be
so
he
turned
back
again
but
the
bees
flew
to
the
royal
palace
and
straight
into
it
through
the
open
windows
crept
round
about
into
every
corner
and
inspected
everything
most
carefully
then
they
hurried
back
and
modeled
the
palace
in
wax
with
such
rapidity
that
any
one
looking
on
would
have
thought
it
was
growing
before
his
eyes
by
the
evening
all
was
ready
and
when
the
tailor
came
next
morning
the
whole
of
the
splendid
building
was
there
and
not
one
nail
in
the
wall
or
tile
of
the
roof
was
wanting
and
it
was
delicate
withal
and
white
as
snow
and
smelt
sweet
as
honey
the
tailor
wrapped
it
carefully
in
his
cloth
and
took
it
to
the
king
who
could
not
admire
it
enough
placed
it
in
his
largest
hall
and
in
return
for
it
presented
the
tailor
with
a
large
stone
house
the
shoemaker
however
did
not
give
up
but
went
for
the
third
time
to
the
king
and
said
lord
king
it
has
come
to
the
tailor
s
ears
that
no
water
will
spring
up
in
the
courtyard
of
the
castle
he
has
boasted
that
it
shall
rise
up
in
the
midst
of
the
courtyard
to
a
man
s
height
and
be
clear
as
then
the
king
ordered
the
tailor
to
be
brought
before
him
and
said
if
a
stream
of
water
does
not
rise
in
my
courtyard
by
as
you
have
promised
the
executioner
shall
in
that
very
place
make
you
shorter
by
the
the
poor
tailor
did
not
take
long
to
think
about
it
but
hurried
out
to
the
gate
and
because
this
time
it
was
a
matter
of
life
and
death
to
him
tears
rolled
down
his
face
whilst
he
was
thus
going
forth
full
of
sorrow
the
foal
to
which
he
had
formerly
given
its
liberty
and
which
had
now
become
a
beautiful
chestnut
horse
came
leaping
toward
him
the
time
has
come
it
said
to
the
tailor
when
i
can
repay
you
for
your
good
deed
i
know
already
what
is
needful
to
you
but
you
shall
soon
have
help
get
on
me
my
back
can
carry
two
such
as
the
tailor
s
courage
came
back
to
him
he
jumped
up
in
one
bound
and
the
horse
went
full
speed
into
the
town
and
right
up
to
the
courtyard
of
the
castle
it
galloped
as
quick
as
lightning
thrice
round
it
and
at
the
third
time
it
fell
violently
down
at
the
same
instant
there
was
a
terrific
clap
of
thunder
a
fragment
of
earth
in
the
middle
of
the
courtyard
sprang
like
a
cannon
ball
into
the
air
and
over
the
castle
directly
after
it
a
jet
of
water
rose
as
high
as
a
man
on
horseback
and
the
water
was
as
pure
as
crystal
and
the
sunbeams
began
to
dance
on
it
when
the
king
saw
that
he
arose
in
amazement
and
went
and
embraced
the
tailor
in
the
sight
of
all
men
but
good
fortune
did
not
last
long
the
king
had
daughters
in
plenty
each
one
prettier
than
the
other
but
he
had
no
son
so
the
malicious
shoemaker
betook
himself
for
the
fourth
time
to
the
king
and
said
lord
king
the
tailor
has
not
given
up
his
arrogance
he
has
now
boasted
that
if
he
liked
he
could
cause
a
son
to
be
brought
to
the
lord
king
through
the
the
king
commanded
the
tailor
to
be
summoned
and
said
if
you
cause
a
son
to
be
brought
to
me
within
nine
days
you
shall
have
my
eldest
daughter
to
the
reward
is
indeed
great
thought
the
little
tailor
one
would
willingly
do
something
for
it
but
the
cherries
grow
too
high
for
me
if
i
climb
for
them
the
bough
will
break
beneath
me
and
i
shall
he
went
home
seated
himself
on
his
and
thought
over
what
was
to
be
done
it
can
t
be
managed
cried
he
at
last
i
will
go
away
after
all
i
can
t
live
in
peace
he
tied
up
his
bundle
and
hurried
away
to
the
gate
when
he
got
to
the
meadow
he
perceived
his
old
friend
the
stork
who
was
walking
backward
and
forward
like
a
philosopher
sometimes
he
stood
still
took
a
frog
into
close
consideration
and
at
length
swallowed
it
down
the
stork
came
to
him
and
greeted
him
i
see
he
began
that
you
have
your
pack
on
your
back
why
are
you
leaving
the
town
the
tailor
told
him
what
the
king
had
required
of
him
and
how
he
could
not
perform
it
and
lamented
his
misfortune
don
t
let
your
hair
grow
gray
about
that
said
the
stork
i
will
help
you
out
of
your
difficulty
for
a
long
time
past
i
have
carried
the
children
in
into
the
town
so
for
once
i
can
fetch
a
little
prince

well

nine
days

this
time

to
the
royal
palace
and
there
will
i
the
little
tailor
went
home
and
at
the
appointed
time
was
at
the
castle
it
was
not
long
before
the
stork
came
flying
thither
and
tapped
at
the
window
the
tailor
opened
it
and
cousin
longlegs
came
carefully
in
and
walked
with
solemn
steps
over
the
smooth
marble
pavement
he
had
a
baby
in
his
beak
that
was
as
lovely
as
an
angel
and
stretched
out
its
little
hands
to
the
queen
the
stork
laid
it
in
her
lap
and
she
caressed
it
and
kissed
it
and
was
beside
herself
with
delight
before
the
stork
flew
away
he
took
his
traveling
bag
off
his
back
and
handed
it
over
to
the
queen
in
it
there
were
little
paper
parcels
full
of
colored
sweetmeats
and
they
were
divided
amongst
the
little
princesses

just
as

danced

was

him
to
the
gallows
worn
out
with
anger
rage
and
the
heat
of
the
day
he
threw
himself
down
when
he
had
closed
his
eyes
and
was
about
to
sleep
the
two
crows
flew
down
from
the
heads
of
the
men
who
were
hanging
there
and
pecked
his
eyes
out
in
his
madness
he
ran
into
the
forest
and
must
have
died
there
of
hunger
for
no
one

ever
either
seen
him
again

there
was
once
an
old
castle
in
the
midst
of
a
large
and
thick
forest
and
in
it
an
old
woman
who
was
a
witch
dwelt
all
alone
in
the
daytime
she
changed
herself
into
a
cat
or
a
but
in
the
evening
she
took
her
proper
shape
again
as
a
human
being
she
could
lure
wild
beasts
and
birds
to
her
then
she
killed
and
boiled
and
roasted
them
if
any
one
came
within
one
hundred
paces
of
the
castle
he
was
obliged
to
stand
still
and
could
not
stir
from
the
place
until
she
bade
him
be
free
but
whenever
an
innocent
maiden
came
within
this
circle
she
changed
her
into
a
bird
shut
her
up
in
a
cage
and
carried
the
cage
into
a
room
in
the
castle
she
had
about
seven
thousand
cages
of
rare
birds
in
the
castle
now
there
was
once
a
maiden
who
was
called
jorinda
who
was
fairer
than
all
other
girls
she
and
a
handsome
youth
named
joringel
had
promised
to
marry
each
other
and
their
greatest
happiness
was
being
together
one
day
in
order
that
they
might
be
able
to
talk
together
in
quiet
they
went
for
a
walk
in
the
forest
take
care
said
joringel
that
you
do
not
go
too
near
the
it
was
a
beautiful
evening
the
sun
shone
brightly
between
the
trunks
of
the
trees
into
the
dark
green
of
the
forest
and
the
turtledoves
sang
mournfully
upon
the
young
boughs
of
the
jorinda
wept
now
and
then
she
sat
down
in
the
sunshine
and
was
sorrowful
joringel
was
sorrowful
too
they
were
as
sad
as
if
they
were
about
to
die
then
they
looked
around
them
and
were
quite
at
a
loss
for
they
did
not
know
by
which
way
to
go
home
the
sun
was
half
above
the
mountain
and
half
set
joringel
looked
through
the
bushes
and
saw
the
old
walls
of
the
castle
close
at
hand
he
was
and
filled
with
deadly
fear
jorinda
was
singing

joringel
looked
for
jorinda
she
was
changed
into
a
nightingale
and
sang
jug

a
with
glowing
eyes
flew
three
times
round
about
her
and
three
times
cried
joringel
could
not
move
he
stood
there
like
a
stone
and
could
neither
weep
nor
speak
nor
move
hand
or
foot
the
sun
had
now
set
the
owl
flew
into
the
thicket
directly
afterward
there
came
out
of
it
a
crooked
old
woman
yellow
and
lean
with
large
red
eyes
and
a
hooked
nose
the
point
of
which
reached
to
her
chin
she
muttered
to
herself
caught
the
nightingale
and
took
it
away
in
her
hand
joringel
could
neither
speak
nor
move
from
the
spot
the
nightingale
was
gone
at
last
the
woman
came
back
and
said
in
a
hollow
voice
greet
thee
zachiel
if
the
moon
shines
on
the
cage
zachiel
let
him
loose
at
then
joringel
was
freed
he
fell
on
his
knees
before
the
woman
and
begged
that
she
would
give
him
back
his
jorinda
but
she
said
that
he
should
never
have
her
again
and
went
away
he
called
he
wept
he
lamented
but
all
in
vain
ah
what
is
to
become
of
me
joringel
went
away
and
at
last
came
to
a
strange
village
there
he
kept
sheep
for
a
long
time
he
often
walked
round
and
round
the
castle
but
not
too
near
to
it
one
night
he
dreamt
that
he
found
a
flower
in
the
middle
of
which
was
a
beautiful
large
pearl
that
he
picked
the
flower
and
went
with
it
to
the
castle
and
that
everything
he
touched
with
the
flower
was
freed
from
enchantment
he
also
dreamt
that
by
means
of
it
he
recovered
his
jorinda
in
the
morning
when
he
awoke
he
began
to
seek
over
hill
and
dale
to
find
such
a
flower
he
sought
until
the
ninth
day
and
then
early
in
the
morning
he
found
the
flower
in
the
middle
of
it
there
was
a
large
as
big
as
the
finest
pearl
day
and
night
he
journeyed
with
this
flower
to
the
castle
when
he
was
within
a
hundred
paces
of
it
he
was
not
held
fast
but
walked
on
to
the
door
joringel
was
full
of
joy
he
touched
the
door
with
the
flower
and
it
sprang
open
he
walked
in
through
the
courtyard
and
listened
for
the
sound
of
the
birds
at
last
he
heard
it
he
went
on
and
found
the
room
from
whence
it
came
there
the
witch
was
feeding
the
birds
in
the
seven
thousand
cages
when
she
saw
joringel
she
was
angry
very
angry
and
scolded
and
spat
poison
and
gall
but
she
could
not
come
within
two
paces
of
him
he
did
not
take
any
notice
of
her
but
went
and
looked
at
the
cages
with
the
birds
but
there
were
many
hundred
nightingales
how
was
he
to
find
his
jorinda
again
just
then
he
saw
the
old
woman
quietly
take
away
a
cage
with
a
bird
in
it
and
go
toward
the
door
swiftly
he
sprang
toward
her
touched
the
cage
with
the
flower
and
also
the
old
woman
she
could
now
no
longer
bewitch
any
one
and
jorinda
was
standing
there
clasping
him
round
the
neck
and
she
was
as
beautiful
as
ever
illustration
how
six
men
got
on
in
the
world
there
was
once
a
man
who
understood
all
kinds
of
arts
he
served
in
war
and
behaved
well
and
bravely
but
when
the
war
was
over
he
received
his
dismissal
and
three
farthings
for
his
expenses
on
the
way
stop
said
he
i
shall
not
be
content
with
this
if
i
can
but
meet
with
the
right
people
the
king
will
have
to
give
me
all
the
treasure
of
the
then
full
of
anger
he
went
into
the
forest
and
saw
a
man
standing
therein
who
had
plucked
up
six
trees
as
if
they
were
blades
of
corn
he
said
to
him
will
you
be
my
servant
and
go
with
me
yes
he
answered
but
first
i
will
take
this
little
bundle
of
sticks
home
to
my
mother
and
he
took
one
of
the
trees
and
wrapped
it
round
the
five
others
lifted
the
bundle
on
his
back
and
carried
it
away
then
he
returned
and
went
with
his
master
who
said
we
two
ought
to
be
able
to
get
through
the
world
very
when
they
had
walked
on
for
a
short
while
they
found
a
huntsman
who
was
kneeling
had
shouldered
his
gun
and
was
about
to
fire
the
master
said
to
him
huntsman
what
are
you
going
to
shoot
he
answered
two
miles
from
here
a
fly
is
sitting
on
the
branch
of
an
and
i
want
to
shoot
its
left
eye
oh
come
with
me
said
the
man
if
we
three
are
together
we
certainly
ought
to
be
able
to
get
on
in
the
world
the
huntsman
was
ready
and
went
with
him
they
came
to
seven
windmills
whose
sails
were
turning
round
with
great
speed
and
yet
no
wind
was
blowing
either
on
the
right
or
the
left
and
no
leaf
was
stirring
then
said
the
man
i
know
not
what
is
driving
the
windmills
not
a
breath
of
air
is
stirring
and
he
went
onward
with
his
servants
and
when
they
had
walked
two
miles
they
saw
a
man
sitting
on
a
tree
who
was
shutting
one
nostril
and
blowing
out
of
the
other
good
gracious
what
are
you
doing
up
there
he
answered
two
miles
from
here
are
seven
windmills
look
i
am
blowing
them
till
they
turn
oh
come
with
me
said
the
man
if
we
four
are
together
we
shall
carry
the
whole
world
before
us
then
the
blower
came
down
and
went
with
him
after
a
while
they
saw
a
man
who
was
standing
on
one
leg
and
had
taken
off
the
other
and
laid
it
beside
him
then
the
master
said
you
have
arranged
things
very
comfortably
to
have
a
i
am
a
runner
he
replied
and
to
stop
myself
running
far
too
fast
i
have
taken
off
one
of
my
legs
for
if
i
run
with
both
i
go
quicker
than
any
bird
can
oh
come
with
me
if
we
five
are
together
we
shall
carry
the
whole
world
before
so
he
went
with
them
it
was
not
long
before
they
met
a
man
who
wore
a
cap
but
had
put
it
quite
on
one
ear
then
the
master
said
to
him
gracefully
gracefully
don
t
stick
your
cap
on
one
ear
you
look
just
like
a
i
must
not
wear
it
otherwise
said
he
for
if
i
set
my
hat
straight
a
terrible
frost
comes
on
and
all
the
birds
in
the
air
are
frozen
and
drop
dead
on
the
oh
come
with
me
said
the
master
if
we
six
are
together
we
can
carry
the
whole
world
before
now
the
six
came
to
a
town
where
the
king
had
proclaimed
that
whosoever
ran
a
race
with
his
daughter
and
won
the
victory
should
be
her
husband
but
whosoever
lost
it
must
lose
his
head
then
the
man
presented
himself
and
said
i
will
however
let
my
servant
run
for
the
king
replied
then
his
life
also
must
be
staked
so
that
his
head
and
thine
are
both
set
on
the
when
that
was
settled
and
made
secure
the
man
buckled
the
other
leg
on
the
runner
and
said
to
him
now
be
nimble
and
help
us
to
it
was
fixed
that
the
one
who
was
the
first
to
bring
some
water
from
a
far
distant
well
was
to
be
the
victor
the
runner
received
a
pitcher
and
the
king
s
daughter
one
too
and
they
began
to
run
at
the
same
time
but
in
an
instant
when
the
king
s
daughter
had
got
a
very
little
way
the
people
who
were
looking
on
could
see
no
more
of
the
runner
it
was
just
as
if
the
wind
had
whistled
by
in
a
short
time
he
reached
the
well
filled
his
pitcher
with
water
and
turned
back
home
however
he
was
overcome
with
fatigue
and
set
his
pitcher
down
lay
down
himself
and
fell
asleep
he
had
however
made
a
pillow
of
a
horse
s
skull
which
was
lying
on
the
ground
in
order
that
he
might
lie
uncomfortably
and
soon
wake
up
again
in
the
meantime
the
king
s
daughter
who
could
also
run
very
well
quite
as
well
as
any
ordinary
mortal
can
had
reached
the
well
and
was
hurrying
back
with
her
pitcher
full
of
water
and
when
she
saw
the
runner
lying
there
asleep
she
was
glad
and
said
my
enemy
is
delivered
over
into
my
hands
emptied
his
pitcher
and
ran
on
and
now
all
would
have
been
lost
if
by
good
luck
the
huntsman
had
not
been
standing
at
the
top
of
the
castle
and
had
not
seen
everything
with
his
sharp
eyes
then
said
he
the
king
s
daughter
shall
still
not
prevail
against
he
loaded
his
gun
and
shot
so
cleverly
that
he
shot
the
horse
s
skull
away
from
under
the
runner
s
head
without
hurting
him
then
the
runner
awoke
leapt
up
and
saw
that
his
pitcher
was
empty
and
that
the
king
s
daughter
was
already
far
in
advance
he
did
not
lose
heart
however
but
ran
back
to
the
well
with
his
pitcher
again
drew
some
water
and
was
still
at
home
again
ten
minutes
before
the
king
s
daughter
behold
said
he
i
have
not
bestirred
myself
till
now
it
did
not
deserve
to
be
called
running
but
it
pained
the
king
and
still
more
his
daughter
that
she
should
be
carried
off
by
a
common
disbanded
soldier
like
that
so
they
took
counsel
with
each
other
how
to
get
rid
of
him
and
his
companions
then
said
the
king
to
her
i
have
thought
of
a
way
don
t
be
afraid
they
shall
not
come
back
and
he
said
to
them
you
shall
now
make
merry
together
and
eat
and
he
conducted
them
to
a
room
which
had
a
floor
of
iron
and
the
doors
also
were
of
iron
and
the
windows
were
guarded
with
iron
bars
there
was
a
table
in
the
room
covered
with
delicious
food
and
the
king
said
to
them
go
in
and
enjoy
and
when
they
were
inside
he
ordered
the
doors
to
be
shut
and
bolted
then
he
sent
for
the
cook
and
commanded
him
to
make
a
fire
under
the
room
until
the
iron
became
this
the
cook
did
and
the
six
who
were
sitting
at
table
began
to
feel
quite
warm
and
they
thought
the
heat
was
caused
by
the
food
but
as
it
became
still
greater
and
they
wanted
to
get
out
and
found
that
the
doors
and
windows
were
bolted
they
became
aware
that
the
king
had
an
evil
intention
and
wanted
to
suffocate
them
he
shall
not
succeed
however
said
the
one
with
the
cap
i
will
cause
a
frost
to
come
before
which
the
fire
shall
be
ashamed
and
creep
then
he
put
his
cap
on
straight
and
immediately
there
came
such
a
frost
that
all
heat
disappeared
and
the
food
on
the
dishes
began
to
freeze
when
an
hour
or
two
had
passed
by
and
the
king
believed
that
they
had
perished
in
the
heat
he
had
the
doors
opened
to
behold
them
himself
but
when
the
doors
were
opened
all
six
were
standing
there
alive
and
well
and
said
that
they
should
very
much
like
to
get
out
to
warm
themselves
for
the
very
food
was
fast
frozen
to
the
dishes
with
the
cold
then
full
of
anger
the
king
went
down
to
the
cook
scolded
him
and
asked
why
he
had
not
done
what
he
had
been
ordered
to
do
but
the
cook
replied
there
is
heat
enough
there
just
look
then
the
king
saw
that
a
fierce
fire
was
burning
under
the
iron
room
and
perceived
that
there
was
no
getting
the
better
of
the
six
in
this
way
again
the
king
considered
how
to
get
rid
of
his
unpleasant
guests
and
caused
their
chief
to
be
brought
and
said
if
you
will
take
gold
and
renounce
my
daughter
you
shall
have
as
much
as
you
oh
yes
lord
king
he
answered
give
me
as
much
as
my
servant
can
carry
and
i
will
not
ask
for
your
on
this
the
king
was
satisfied
and
the
other
continued
in
fourteen
days
i
will
come
and
fetch
thereupon
he
summoned
together
all
the
tailors
in
the
whole
kingdom
and
they
were
to
sit
for
fourteen
days
and
sew
a
sack
and
when
it
was
ready
the
strong
one
who
could
tear
up
trees
had
to
take
it
on
his
back
and
go
with
it
to
the
king
then
said
the
king
who
can
that
strong
fellow
be
who
is
carrying
a
bundle
of
linen
on
his
back
that
is
as
big
as
a
house
and
he
was
alarmed
and
said
what
a
lot
of
gold
he
can
carry
away
then
he
commanded
a
ton
of
gold
to
be
brought
it
took
sixteen
of
his
strongest
men
to
carry
it
but
the
strong
one
snatched
it
up
in
one
hand
put
it
in
his
sack
and
said
why
don
t
you
bring
more
at
the
same
time
that
hardly
covers
the
bottom
then
little
by
little
the
king
caused
all
his
treasure
to
be
brought
thither
and
the
strong
one
pushed
it
into
the
sack
and
still
the
sack
was
not
half
full
with
it
bring
more
cried
he
these
few
crumbs
don
t
fill
then
seven
thousand
carts
with
gold
had
to
be
gathered
together
in
the
whole
kingdom
and
the
strong
one
thrust
them
and
the
oxen
harnessed
to
them
into
his
sack
i
will
examine
it
no
longer
said
he
but
will
just
take
what
comes
so
long
as
the
sack
is
but
when
all
that
was
inside
there
was
still
room
for
a
great
deal
more
then
he
said
i
will
just
make
an
end
of
the
thing
people
do
sometimes
tie
up
a
sack
even
when
it
is
not
so
he
took
it
on
his
back
and
went
away
with
his
comrades
when
the
king
now
saw
how
one
single
man
was
carrying
away
the
entire
wealth
of
the
country
he
became
enraged
and
bade
his
horsemen
mount
and
pursue
the
six
and
ordered
them
to
take
the
sack
away
from
the
strong
one
two
regiments
speedily
overtook
the
six
and
called
out
you
are
prisoners
put
down
the
sack
with
the
gold
or
you
will
all
be
cut
to
pieces
what
say
you
cried
the
blower
that
we
are
prisoners
rather
than
that
should
happen
all
of
you
shall
dance
about
in
the
and
he
closed
one
nostril
and
with
the
other
blew
on
the
two
regiments
then
they
were
driven
away
from
each
other
and
carried
into
the
blue
sky
over
all
the
mountains
one
here
the
other
there
one
sergeant
cried
for
mercy
he
had
nine
wounds
and
was
a
brave
fellow
who
did
not
deserve
the
blower
stopped
a
little
so
that
he
came
down
without
injury
and
then
the
blower
said
to
him
now
go
home
to
your
king
and
tell
him
he
had
better
send
some
more
horsemen
and
i
will
blow
them
all
into
the
when
the
king
was
informed
of
this
he
said
let
the
rascals
go
they
have
the
best
of
then
the
six
conveyed
the
riches
home
divided
it
amongst
them
and
lived
in
content
until
their
death
illustration
the
there
was
once
upon
a
time
an
old
queen
whose
husband
had
been
dead
for
many
years
and
she
had
a
beautiful
daughter
when
the
princess
grew
up
she
was
betrothed
to
a
prince
who
lived
very
far
away
when
the
time
came
for
her
to
be
married
and
she
had
to
journey
forth
into
the
distant
kingdom
the
aged
queen
packed
up
for
her
many
costly
vessels
of
silver
and
gold
and
trinkets
also
of
gold
and
silver
and
cups
and
jewels
in
short
everything
which
appertained
to
a
royal
dowry
for
she
loved
her
child
with
all
her
heart
she
likewise
sent
her
who
was
to
ride
with
her
and
hand
her
over
to
the
bridegroom
each
had
a
horse
for
the
journey
but
the
horse
of
the
king
s
daughter
was
called
falada
and
could
speak
so
when
the
hour
of
parting
had
come
the
aged
mother
went
into
her
bedroom
took
a
small
knife
and
cut
her
finger
with
it
until
it
bled
then
she
held
a
white
handkerchief
to
it
into
which
she
let
three
drops
of
blood
fall
she
gave
the
handkerchief
to
her
daughter
and
said
dear
child
preserve
this
carefully
it
will
be
of
service
to
you
on
your
so
they
took
a
sorrowful
leave
of
each
other
the
princess
put
the
piece
of
cloth
in
her
bosom
mounted
her
horse
and
then
went
away
to
her
bridegroom
after
she
had
ridden
for
a
while
she
felt
a
burning
thirst
and
said
to
her
dismount
and
take
my
cup
which
you
have
brought
with
you
and
get
me
some
water
from
the
stream
for
i
should
like
to
if
you
are
thirsty
said
the
get
off
your
horse
yourself
and
lie
down
and
drink
out
of
the
water
i
don
t
choose
to
be
your
so
in
her
great
thirst
the
princess
alighted
bent
down
over
the
water
in
the
stream
and
drank
and
was
not
allowed
to
drink
out
of
the
golden
cup
then
she
said
ah
heaven
and
the
three
drops
of
blood
answered
thy
mother
only
knew
twould
surely
break
her
heart
in
two
but
the
king
s
daughter
was
humble
said
nothing
and
mounted
her
horse
again
she
rode
some
miles
further
but
the
day
was
warm
the
sun
scorched
her
and
she
was
thirsty
once
more
when
they
came
to
a
stream
of
water
she
again
cried
to
her
dismount
and
give
me
some
water
in
my
golden
cup
for
she
had
long
ago
forgotten
the
girl
s
ill
words
but
the
said
still
more
haughtily
if
you
wish
to
drink
drink
as
you
can
i
don
t
choose
to
be
your
then
in
her
great
thirst
the
king
s
daughter
alighted
bent
over
the
flowing
stream
wept
and
said
ah
heaven
and
the
drops
of
blood
again
replied
thy
mother
only
knew
twould
surely
break
her
heart
in
two
and
as
she
was
thus
drinking
and
leaning
right
over
the
stream
the
handkerchief
with
the
three
drops
of
blood
fell
out
of
her
bosom
and
floated
away
with
the
water
without
her
observing
it
so
great
was
her
trouble
the
however
had
seen
it
and
she
rejoiced
to
think
that
she
had
now
power
over
the
bride
for
since
the
princess
had
lost
the
drops
of
blood
she
had
become
weak
and
powerless
so
now
when
she
wanted
to
mount
her
horse
again
the
one
that
was
called
falada
the
said
falada
is
more
suitable
for
me
and
my
nag
will
do
for
you
and
the
princess
had
to
be
content
with
that
then
the
with
many
hard
words
bade
the
princess
exchange
her
royal
apparel
for
her
own
shabby
clothes
and
at
length
she
was
compelled
to
swear
by
the
clear
sky
above
her
that
she
would
not
say
one
word
of
this
to
any
one
at
the
royal
court
and
if
she
had
not
taken
this
oath
she
would
have
been
killed
on
the
spot
but
falada
saw
all
this
and
observed
it
well
the
now
mounted
falada
and
the
true
bride
the
bad
horse
and
thus
they
traveled
onward
until
they
entered
the
royal
palace
there
were
great
rejoicings
over
her
arrival
and
the
prince
sprang
forward
to
meet
her
lifted
the
from
her
horse
and
thought
she
was
his
bride
she
was
conducted
but
the
real
princess
was
left
standing
below
then
the
old
king
looked
out
of
the
window
and
saw
her
standing
in
the
courtyard
and
how
dainty
and
delicate
and
beautiful
she
was
he
instantly
went
to
the
royal
apartment
and
asked
the
bride
about
the
girl
she
had
with
her
who
was
standing
down
below
in
the
courtyard
and
who
she
was
i
picked
her
up
on
my
way
for
a
companion
give
the
girl
something
to
work
at
that
she
may
not
stand
but
the
old
king
had
no
work
for
her
and
knew
of
none
so
he
said
i
have
a
little
boy
who
tends
the
geese
she
may
help
the
boy
was
called
conrad
and
the
true
bride
had
to
help
him
to
tend
the
geese
soon
afterward
the
false
bride
said
to
the
young
king
dearest
husband
i
beg
you
to
do
me
a
he
answered
i
will
do
so
most
then
send
for
the
butcher
and
have
the
head
of
the
horse
on
which
i
rode
here
cut
off
for
it
vexed
me
on
the
in
reality
she
was
afraid
that
the
horse
might
tell
how
she
had
behaved
to
the
king
s
daughter
then
she
succeeded
in
making
the
king
promise
that
it
should
be
done
and
the
faithful
falada
was
to
die
this
came
to
the
ears
of
the
real
princess
and
she
secretly
promised
the
butcher
a
piece
of
gold
if
he
would
perform
a
small
service
for
her
there
was
a
great
gateway
in
the
town
through
which
morning
and
evening
she
had
to
pass
with
the
geese
would
he
be
so
good
as
to
nail
up
falada
s
head
on
it
so
that
she
might
see
him
again
the
butcher
promised
to
do
that
and
cut
off
the
head
and
nailed
it
fast
beneath
the
dark
gateway
early
in
the
morning
when
she
and
conrad
drove
out
their
flock
beneath
this
gateway
she
said
in
passing
falada
hanging
there
then
the
head
answered
young
queen
how
ill
you
fare
if
this
your
tender
mother
knew
her
heart
would
surely
break
in
two
then
they
went
still
farther
out
of
the
town
and
drove
their
geese
into
the
country
and
when
they
had
come
to
the
meadow
she
sat
down
and
unbound
her
hair
which
was
like
pure
gold
conrad
saw
it
and
delighted
in
its
brightness
and
wanted
to
pluck
out
a
few
hairs
then
she
said
blow
thou
gentle
wind
i
say
blow
conrad
s
little
hat
away
and
make
him
chase
it
here
and
there
until
i
ve
braided
all
my
hair
and
bound
it
up
and
there
came
such
a
violent
wind
that
it
blew
conrad
s
hat
far
away
across
county
and
he
was
forced
to
run
after
it
when
he
came
back
she
had
finished
combing
her
hair
and
was
putting
it
up
again
and
he
could
not
get
any
of
it
then
conrad
was
angry
and
would
not
speak
to
her
and
thus
they
watched
the
geese
until
the
evening
and
then
they
went
home
illustration
the
head
answered
alas
young
queen
how
ill
you
fare
next
day
when
they
were
driving
the
geese
out
through
the
dark
gateway
the
maiden
said
falada
hanging
there
falada
answered
young
queen
how
ill
you
fare
if
this
your
tender
mother
knew
her
heart
would
surely
break
in
two
and
she
sat
down
again
in
the
field
and
began
to
comb
out
her
hair
conrad
ran
and
tried
to
clutch
it
so
she
said
in
haste
blow
thou
gentle
wind
i
say
blow
conrad
s
little
hat
away
and
make
him
chase
it
here
and
there
until
i
ve
braided
all
my
hair
and
bound
it
up
then
the
wind
blew
and
blew
his
little
hat
off
his
head
and
far
away
and
conrad
was
forced
to
run
after
it
when
he
came
back
her
hair
had
been
put
up
a
long
time
and
he
could
get
none
of
it
so
they
looked
after
their
geese
till
evening
came
but
in
the
evening
after
they
had
got
home
conrad
went
to
the
old
king
and
said
i
won
t
tend
the
geese
with
that
girl
any
longer
why
not
inquired
the
old
king
oh
because
she
vexes
me
the
whole
day
then
the
old
king
commanded
him
to
relate
what
it
was
that
she
did
to
him
and
conrad
said
in
the
morning
when
we
pass
beneath
the
dark
gateway
with
the
flock
there
is
a
sorry
horse
s
head
on
the
wall
and
she
says
to
it
falada
hanging
there
and
the
head
replies
young
queen
how
ill
you
fare
if
this
your
tender
mother
knew
her
heart
would
surely
break
in
two
and
conrad
went
on
to
relate
what
happened
on
the
and
how
when
there
he
had
to
chase
his
hat
the
old
king
commanded
him
to
drive
his
flock
out
again
next
day
and
as
soon
as
morning
came
he
placed
himself
behind
the
dark
gateway
and
heard
how
the
maiden
spoke
to
the
head
of
falada
then
he
went
into
the
country
and
hid
himself
in
the
thicket
in
the
meadow
there
he
soon
saw
with
his
own
eyes
the
and
the
bringing
their
flock
and
how
after
a
while
she
sat
down
and
unplaited
her
hair
which
shone
with
radiance
and
soon
she
said
blow
thou
gentle
wind
i
say
blow
conrad
s
little
hat
away
and
make
him
chase
it
here
and
there
until
i
ve
braided
all
my
hair
and
bound
it
up
then
came
a
blast
of
wind
and
carried
off
conrad
s
hat
so
that
he
had
to
run
far
away
while
the
maiden
quietly
went
on
combing
and
plaiting
her
hair
all
of
which
the
king
observed
then
quite
unseen
he
went
away
and
when
the
came
home
in
the
evening
he
called
her
aside
and
asked
why
she
did
all
these
things
i
may
not
tell
you
that
and
i
dare
not
lament
my
sorrows
to
any
human
being
for
i
have
sworn
not
to
do
so
by
the
heaven
which
is
above
me
if
i
had
not
done
that
i
should
have
lost
my
he
urged
her
and
left
her
no
peace
but
he
could
draw
nothing
from
her
then
said
he
if
you
will
not
tell
me
anything
tell
your
sorrows
to
the
iron
stove
there
and
he
went
away
then
she
crept
into
the
iron
stove
and
began
to
weep
and
lament
and
emptied
her
whole
heart
and
said
here
am
i
deserted
by
the
whole
world
and
yet
i
am
a
king
s
daughter
and
a
false
has
by
force
brought
me
to
such
a
pass
that
i
have
been
compelled
to
put
off
my
royal
apparel
she
has
taken
my

work
of
a
my
mother

knew
twould
surely
break
her
heart
in
two
the
old
king
was
standing
outside
by
the
pipe
of
the
stove
and
was
listening
to
what
she
said
and
heard
it
then
he
came
back
again
and
bade
her
come
out
of
the
stove
and
royal
garments
were
placed
on
her
and
it
was
marvelous
how
beautiful
she
was
the
old
king
called
his
son
and
revealed
to
him
that
he
had
got
the
false
bride
who
was
only
a
but
that
the
true
one
was
standing
there
as
the
the
young
king
rejoiced
with
all
his
heart
when
he
saw
her
beauty
and
youth
and
a
great
feast
was
made
ready
to
which
all
the
people
and
all
good
friends
were
invited
at
the
head
of
the
table
sat
the
bridegroom
with
the
king
s
daughter
at
one
side
of
him
and
the
on
the
other
but
the
was
blinded
and
did
not
recognize
the
princess
in
her
dazzling
array
when
they
had
eaten
and
drunk
and
were
merry
the
old
king
asked
the
as
a
riddle
what
a
person
deserved
who
had
behaved
in
such
and
such
a
way
to
her
master
and
at
the
same
time
related
the
whole
story
and
asked
what
sentence
such
a
one
merited
then
the
false
bride
said
she
deserves
no
better
fate
than
to
be
put
in
a
barrel
which
is
studded
inside
with
pointed
nails
and
two
white
horses
should
be
harnessed
to
it
to
drag
her
along
through
one
street
after
another
till
she
is
it
is
you
said
the
old
king
and
you
have
pronounced
your
own
sentence
thus
shall
it
be
done
unto
and
when
the
sentence
had
been
carried
out
the
young
king
married
his
true
bride
and
both
of
them
reigned
over
their
kingdom
in
peace
and
happiness
illustration
the
singing
soaring
lark
there
was
once
on
a
time
a
man
who
was
about
to
set
out
on
a
long
journey
at
parting
he
asked
his
three
daughters
what
he
should
bring
back
for
them
whereupon
the
eldest
wished
for
pearls
the
second
wished
for
diamonds
but
the
third
said
dear
father
i
should
like
a
singing
soaring
the
father
said
yes
if
i
can
get
it
you
shall
have
it
kissed
all
three
and
set
out
now
when
the
time
had
come
for
him
to
return
home
he
had
brought
pearls
and
diamonds
for
the
two
eldest
but
he
had
sought
everywhere
in
vain
for
a
singing
soaring
lark
for
the
youngest
and
he
was
very
unhappy
about
it
for
she
was
his
favorite
child
then
his
road
lay
through
a
forest
and
in
the
midst
of
it
was
a
splendid
castle
near
the
castle
stood
a
tree
and
quite
on
the
top
of
the
tree
he
saw
a
singing
soaring
lark
aha
you
come
just
at
the
right
moment
he
said
quite
delighted
and
called
to
his
servant
to
climb
up
and
catch
the
little
creature
but
as
he
approached
the
tree
a
lion
leapt
from
beneath
it
shook
himself
and
roared
till
the
leaves
on
the
tree
trembled
he
who
tries
to
steal
my
singing
soaring
lark
he
cried
will
i
then
the
man
said
i
did
not
know
that
the
bird
belonged
to
you
i
will
make
amends
for
the
wrong
i
have
done
and
ransom
myself
with
a
large
sum
of
money
only
spare
my
the
lion
said
nothing
can
save
you
unless
you
will
promise
to
give
me
for
mine
own
what
first
meets
you
on
your
return
home
but
if
you
will
do
that
i
will
grant
you
your
life
and
you
shall
have
the
bird
for
your
daughter
into
the
the
man
hesitated
and
said
that
might
be
my
youngest
daughter
she
loves
me
best
and
always
runs
to
meet
me
on
my
return
the
servant
however
was
terrified
and
said
why
should
your
daughter
be
the
very
one
to
meet
you
it
might
as
easily
be
a
cat
or
dog
then
the
man
allowed
himself
to
be
persuaded
took
the
singing
soaring
lark
and
promised
to
give
the
lion
whatsoever
should
first
meet
him
on
his
return
home
when
he
reached
home
and
entered
his
house
the
first
who
met
him
was
no
other
than
his
youngest
and
dearest
daughter
who
came
running
up
kissed
and
embraced
him
when
she
saw
that
he
had
brought
with
him
a
singing
soaring
lark
she
was
beside
herself
with
joy
the
father
however
could
not
rejoice
but
began
to
weep
and
said
my
dearest
child
i
have
bought
the
little
bird
at
a
great
cost
in
return
for
it
i
have
been
obliged
to
promise
you
to
a
savage
lion
when
he
has
you
he
will
tear
you
in
pieces
and
devour
you
and
he
told
her
all
just
as
it
had
happened
and
begged
her
not
to
go
thither
come
what
might
but
she
consoled
him
and
said
dearest
father
indeed
your
promise
must
be
fulfilled
i
will
go
thither
and
soften
the
lion
so
that
i
may
return
to
you
next
morning
she
had
the
road
pointed
out
to
her
took
leave
and
went
fearlessly
out
into
the
forest
the
lion
however
was
an
enchanted
prince
and
was
by
day
a
lion
and
all
his
people
were
lions
with
him
but
in
the
night
they
resumed
their
natural
human
shapes
on
her
arrival
she
was
kindly
received
and
led
into
the
castle
when
night
came
the
lion
turned
into
a
handsome
man
and
their
wedding
was
celebrated
with
great
magnificence
they
lived
happily
together
remained
awake
at
night
and
slept
in
the
daytime
one
day
he
came
and
said
there
is
a
feast
in
your
father
s
house
because
your
eldest
sister
is
to
be
married
and
if
you
are
inclined
to
go
there
my
lions
shall
conduct
she
said
yes
i
should
very
much
like
to
see
my
father
again
and
went
thither
accompanied
by
the
lions
there
was
great
joy
when
she
arrived
for
they
had
all
believed
that
she
had
been
torn
in
pieces
by
the
lion
and
had
long
ceased
to
live
but
she
told
them
what
a
handsome
husband
she
had
and
how
well
off
she
was
she
remained
with
them
while
the
lasted
and
then
went
back
again
to
the
forest
when
the
second
daughter
was
about
to
be
married
and
she
was
again
invited
to
the
wedding
she
said
to
the
lion
this
time
i
will
not
go
alone
you
must
come
with
the
lion
however
said
that
it
was
too
dangerous
for
him
for
if
a
ray
from
a
burning
candle
should
fall
on
him
he
would
be
changed
into
a
dove
and
for
seven
years
long
would
have
to
fly
about
with
the
doves
she
said
ah
but
do
come
with
me
i
will
take
great
care
of
you
and
guard
you
from
all
so
they
went
away
together
and
took
with
them
their
little
child
as
well
she
had
a
chamber
built
so
strong
and
thick
that
no
ray
could
pierce
through
it
in
this
he
was
to
shut
himself
up
when
the
candles
were
lit
for
the
but
the
door
was
made
of
green
wood
which
warped
and
left
a
little
crack
which
no
one
noticed
the
wedding
was
celebrated
with
magnificence
but
when
the
procession
with
all
its
candles
and
torches
came
back
from
church
and
passed
by
this
apartment
a
ray
about
the
breadth
of
a
hair
fell
on
the
king
s
son
when
this
ray
touched
him
he
was
transformed
in
an
instant
and
when
she
came
in
and
looked
for
him
she
did
not
see
him
but
a
white
dove
was
sitting
there
the
dove
said
to
her
for
seven
years
must
i
fly
about
the
world
but
at
every
seventh
step
that
you
take
i
will
let
fall
a
drop
of
red
blood
and
a
white
feather
these
will
show
you
the
way
if
you
follow
the
trace
you
can
release
thereupon
the
dove
flew
out
at
the
door
and
she
followed
him
at
every
seventh
step
a
red
drop
of
blood
and
a
little
white
feather
fell
down
and
showed
her
the
way
so
she
went
continually
farther
and
farther
in
the
wide
world
never
looking
about
her
nor
resting
and
the
seven
years
were
almost
past
then
she
rejoiced
and
thought
that
they
would
soon
be
delivered
and
yet
they
were
so
far
from
it
once
when
they
were
thus
moving
onwards
no
little
feather
and
no
drop
of
red
blood
fell
and
when
she
raised
her
eyes
the
dove
had
disappeared
and
as
she
thought
to
herself
in
this
no
man
can
help
me
she
climbed
up
to
the
sun
and
said
to
him
you
shine
into
every
crevice
and
over
every
peak
have
you
not
seen
a
white
dove
flying
no
said
the
sun
i
have
seen
none
but
i
present
you
with
a
casket
open
it
when
you
are
in
sorest
then
she
thanked
the
sun
and
went
on
until
evening
came
and
the
moon
appeared
she
then
asked
her
you
shine
the
whole
night
through
and
on
every
field
and
forest
have
you
not
seen
a
white
dove
flying
no
said
the
moon
i
have
seen
no
dove
but
here
i
give
you
an
egg
break
it
when
you
are
in
great
she
thanked
the
moon
and
went
on
until
the
night
wind
came
up
and
blew
on
her
then
she
said
to
it
you
blow
over
every
tree
and
under
every
leaf
have
you
not
seen
a
white
dove
flying
no
said
the
night
wind
i
have
seen
none
but
i
will
ask
the
three
other
winds
perhaps
they
have
seen
the
east
wind
and
the
west
wind
came
and
had
seen
nothing
but
the
south
wind
said
i
have
seen
the
white
dove
it
has
flown
to
the
red
sea
there
it
has
become
a
lion
again
for
the
seven
years
are
over
the
lion
is
there
fighting
with
a
dragon
the
dragon
however
is
an
enchanted
the
night
wind
then
said
to
her
i
will
advise
you
go
to
the
red
sea
on
the
right
bank
are
some
tall
reeds
count
them
break
off
the
eleventh
and
strike
the
dragon
with
it
then
the
lion
will
be
able
to
subdue
it
and
both
then
will
regain
their
human
form
after
that
look
round
and
you
will
see
the
griffin
which
is
by
the
red
sea
swing
yourself
with
your
beloved
on
to
his
back
and
the
bird
will
carry
you
over
the
sea
to
your
own
home
here
is
a
nut
for
you
when
you
are
above
the
centre
of
the
sea
let
the
nut
fall
it
will
immediately
shoot
up
and
a
tall
will
grow
out
of
the
water
on
which
the
griffin
may
rest
for
if
he
can
not
rest
he
will
not
be
strong
enough
to
carry
you
across
if
you
forget
to
throw
down
the
nut
he
will
let
you
fall
into
the
then
she
went
thither
and
found
everything
as
the
night
wind
had
said
she
counted
the
reeds
by
the
sea
and
cut
off
the
eleventh
struck
the
dragon
with
it
whereupon
the
lion
overcame
it
immediately
both
of
them
regained
their
human
shapes
but
when
the
princess
who
had
been
the
dragon
was
delivered
from
enchantment
she
took
the
youth
by
the
arm
seated
herself
on
the
griffin
and
carried
him
off
with
her
there
stood
the
poor
maiden
who
had
wandered
so
far
and
was
again
forsaken
she
sat
down
and
cried
but
at
last
she
took
courage
and
said
still
i
will
go
as
far
as
the
wind
blows
and
as
long
as
the
cock
crows
until
i
find
she
went
forth
by
long
long
roads
until
at
last
she
came
to
the
castle
where
both
of
them
were
living
together
there
she
heard
that
a
feast
was
to
be
held
in
which
they
would
celebrate
their
wedding
but
she
said
god
still
helps
me
and
opened
the
casket
that
the
sun
had
given
her
a
dress
lay
therein
as
brilliant
as
the
sun
itself
so
she
took
it
out
and
put
it
on
and
went
up
into
the
castle
and
every
one
even
the
bride
looked
at
her
with
astonishment
the
dress
pleased
the
bride
so
well
that
she
thought
it
might
do
for
her
and
asked
if
it
was
for
sale
not
for
money
or
land
answered
she
but
for
flesh
and
the
bride
asked
her
what
she
meant
by
that
then
she
said
let
me
sleep
a
night
in
the
chamber
where
the
bridegroom
the
bride
would
not
yet
wanted
very
much
to
have
the
dress
at
last
she
consented
but
the
page
was
to
give
the
prince
a
when
it
was
night
and
the
youth
was
already
asleep
she
was
led
into
the
chamber
she
seated
herself
on
the
bed
and
said
i
have
followed
you
for
seven
years
i
have
been
to
the
sun
and
the
moon
and
the
four
winds
and
have
inquired
for
you
and
have
helped
you
against
the
dragon
will
you
then
forget
me
but
the
prince
slept
so
soundly
that
it
only
seemed
to
him
as
if
the
wind
were
whistling
outside
in
the
when
therefore
day
broke
she
was
led
out
again
and
had
to
give
up
the
golden
dress
and
as
that
had
been
of
no
avail
she
was
sad
went
out
into
a
meadow
sat
down
there
and
wept
while
she
was
sitting
there
she
thought
of
the
egg
which
the
moon
had
given
her
she
opened
it
and
there
came
out
a
clucking
hen
with
twelve
chickens
all
of
gold
they
ran
about
chirping
and
crept
again
under
the
old
hen
s
wings
nothing
more
beautiful
was
ever
seen
in
the
world
she
arose
and
drove
them
through
the
meadow
the
bride
looked
out
of
the
window
and
the
little
chickens
pleased
her
so
that
she
came
down
and
asked
if
they
were
for
sale
not
for
money
or
land
but
for
flesh
and
blood
let
me
sleep
again
in
the
chamber
where
the
bridegroom
the
bride
said
yes
intending
to
cheat
her
as
on
the
former
evening
but
when
the
prince
went
to
bed
he
asked
the
page
what
the
murmuring
and
rustling
in
the
night
had
been
on
this
the
page
told
all
that
he
had
been
forced
to
give
him
a
because
a
poor
girl
had
slept
secretly
in
the
chamber
and
that
he
was
to
give
him
another
that
night
the
prince
said
pour
out
the
draught
by
the
at
night
she
was
again
led
in
and
when
she
began
to
relate
how
ill
all
had
fared
with
her
he
immediately
recognized
his
beloved
wife
by
her
voice
sprang
up
and
cried
now
i
really
am
released
i
have
been
as
it
were
in
a
dream
for
the
strange
princess
has
bewitched
me
so
that
i
have
been
compelled
to
forget
you
but
god
has
delivered
me
from
the
spell
at
the
right
then
they
both
left
the
castle
secretly
in
the
night
for
they
feared
the
father
of
the
princess
who
was
a
sorcerer
they
seated
themselves
on
the
griffin
which
bore
them
across
the
red
sea
when
they
were
in
the
midst
of
it
she
let
fall
the
nut
immediately
a
tall
grew
up
whereon
the
bird
rested
and
then
carried
them
home
where
they
found
their
child
who
had
grown
tall
and
beautiful
and
they
lived
thenceforth
happily
until
their
death
illustration
doctor
knowall
there
was
once
on
a
time
a
poor
peasant
called
crab
who
drove
two
oxen
with
a
load
of
wood
to
town
and
sold
it
to
a
doctor
for
two
dollars
when
the
money
was
being
counted
out
to
him
it
so
happened
that
the
doctor
was
sitting
at
table
and
when
the
peasant
saw
how
daintily
he
ate
and
drank
his
heart
desired
what
he
saw
and
he
would
willingly
have
been
a
doctor
so
he
remained
standing
a
while
and
at
length
inquired
if
he
too
could
not
be
a
doctor
oh
yes
said
the
doctor
that
is
soon
what
must
i
do
asked
the
peasant
in
the
first
place
buy
yourself

delicate

and
said
grethe
that

the
first

the
servant
however
thought
he
intended
by
that
to

the
first
thief
and
as
he
actually
was
so
he
was
terrified
and
said
to

badly
he
said
i

went
in

and
said
grethe
that

illustration
the
first
servant
came
with
a
dish
of
delicate
fare
the
lord
told
the
doctor
that
he
must
show
his
skill
by
guessing
what
was
under
the
cover
the
doctor
looked
at
the
dish
had
no
idea
what
was
in
it
and
cried
out
alas
poor
crab
when
the
lord
heard
that
he
cried
there
he
knows
who
has
the
money
at
this
the
servants
were
terribly
anxious
they
winked
at
the
doctor
to
come
out
to
them
when
he
went
out
they
all
four
confessed
that
they
had
stolen
the
money
and
that
they
were
willing
to
restore
it
they
led
him
to
the
spot
where
it
was
hidden
thus
the
lord
got
back
his
wealth
and
doctor
knowall
received
a
large
reward
and
became
a
famous
man
illustration
the
blue
light
there
was
once
on
a
time
a
soldier
who
for
many
years
had
served
the
king
faithfully
but
when
the
war
came
to
an
end
he
could
serve
no
longer
because
of
the
many
wounds
which
he
had
received
the
king
said
to
him
you
may
return
to
your
home
i
need
you
no
longer
you
will
not
receive
any
more
money
for
only
he
receives
wages
who
renders
me
service
for
then
the
soldier
did
not
know
how
to
earn
a
living
went
away
greatly
troubled
and
walked
the
whole
day
until
in
the
evening
he
entered
a
forest
when
darkness
came
on
he
saw
a
light
which
he
went
toward
and
came
to
a
house
wherein
lived
a
witch
do
give
me
one
night
s
lodging
and
a
little
to
eat
and
drink
said
he
to
her
or
i
shall
oho
she
answered
who
gives
anything
to
a
runaway
soldier
yet
will
i
be
compassionate
and
take
you
in
if
you
will
do
what
i
what
do
you
wish
said
the
soldier
that
you
should
dig
all
round
my
garden
for
me
the
soldier
consented
and
next
day
labored
with
all
his
strength
but
could
not
finish
it
by
the
evening
i
see
well
enough
said
the
witch
that
you
can
do
no
more
but
i
will
keep
you
yet
another
night
in
payment
for
which
you
must
chop
me
a
load
of
wood
and
make
it
the
soldier
spent
the
whole
day
in
doing
it
and
in
the
evening
the
witch
proposed
that
he
should
stay
one
night
more
you
shall
do
me
a
very
trifling
piece
of
work
behind
my
house
there
is
an
old
dry
well
into
which
my
light
has
fallen
it
burns
blue
and
never
goes
out
and
you
shall
bring
it
up
again
for
next
day
the
old
woman
took
him
to
the
well
and
let
him
down
in
a
basket
he
found
the
blue
light
and
made
her
a
signal
to
draw
him
up
again
she
did
draw
him
up
but
when
he
came
near
the
edge
she
stretched
down
her
hand
and
wanted
to
take
the
blue
light
away
from
him
no
said
he
perceiving
her
evil
intention
i
will
not
give
you
the
light
until
i
am
standing
with
both
feet
upon
the
the
witch
fell
into
a
passion
let
him
down
again
into
the
well
and
went
away
the
poor
soldier
fell
without
injury
on
the
moist
ground
and
the
blue
light
went
on
burning
but
of
what
use
was
that
to
him
he
saw
very
well
that
he
could
not
escape
death
he
sat
for
a
while
very
sorrowfully
then
suddenly
he
felt
in
his
pocket
and
found
his
pipe
which
was
still
half
full
of
tobacco
this
shall
be
my
last
pleasure
thought
he
pulled
it
out
lit
it
at
the
blue
light
and
began
to
smoke
when
the
smoke
had
circled
about
the
cavern
suddenly
a
little
black
man
stood
before
him
and
said
master
what
are
your
commands
what
commands
have
i
to
give
you
replied
the
soldier
quite
astonished
i
must
do
everything
you
bid
me
said
the
little
man
good
said
the
soldier
then
in
the
first
place
help
me
out
of
this
the
little
man
took
him
by
the
hand
and
led
him
through
an
underground
passage
but
the
soldier
did
not
forget
to
take
the
blue
light
with
him
on
the
way
the
little
man
showed
him
treasures
hidden
there
and
the
soldier
took
as
much
gold
as
he
could
carry
when
he
was
above
he
said
to
the
little
man
now
go
and
bind
the
old
witch
and
carry
her
before
the
in
a
short
time
she
with
frightful
cries
came
riding
by
as
swift
as
the
wind
on
a
wild
nor
was
it
long
after
that
before
the
little
man
reappeared
it
is
all
done
said
he
and
the
witch
is
already
hanging
on
the
gallows
what
further
commands
has
my
lord
inquired
the
little
man
at
this
moment
none
answered
the
soldier
you
may
return
home
only
be
at
hand
immediately
if
i
summon
nothing
more
is
needed
than
that
you
should
light
your
pipe
at
the
blue
light
and
i
will
appear
before
you
at
thereupon
he
vanished
from
sight
the
soldier
returned
to
the
town
from
which
he
had
come
he
went
to
the
best
inn
ordered
himself
handsome
clothes
and
then
bade
the
landlord
furnish
him
a
room
as
magnificent
as
possible
when
it
was
ready
and
the
soldier
had
taken
possession
of
it
he
summoned
the
little
black
man
and
said
i
have
served
the
king
faithfully
but
he
has
dismissed
me
and
left
me
to
hunger
and
now
i
want
to
punish
what
am
i
to
do
asked
the
little
man
late
at
night
when
the
king
s
daughter
is
in
bed
bring
her
here
in
her
sleep
she
shall
do
servant
s
work
for
the
little
man
said
that
is
an
easy
thing
for
me
to
do
but
a
very
dangerous
thing
for
you
for
if
it
is
discovered
you
will
fare
when
twelve
o
clock
had
struck
the
door
sprang
open
and
the
little
man
carried
in
the
princess
aha
are
you
there
cried
the
soldier
get
to
your
work
at
once
fetch
the
broom
and
sweep
the
when
she
had
done
this
he
ordered
her
to
come
to
his
chair
then
he
stretched
out
his
feet
and
said
pull
off
my
boots
for
me
and
made
her
pick
them
up
again
and
clean
and
brighten
them
she
however
did
everything
he
bade
her
without
opposition
silently
and
with
eyes
when
the
first
cock
crowed
the
little
man
carried
her
back
to
the
royal
palace
and
laid
her
in
her
bed
next
morning
when
the
princess
arose
she
went
to
her
father
and
told
him
that
she
had
had
a
very
strange
dream
i
was
carried
through
the
streets
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
said
she
and
taken
into
a
soldier
s
room
and
i
had
to
wait
upon
him
like
a
servant
sweep
his
room
clean
his
boots
and
do
all
kinds
of
menial
work
it
was
only
a
dream
and
yet
i
am
just
as
tired
as
if
i
really
had
done
the
dream
may
have
been
true
said
the
king
i
will
give
you
a
piece
of
advice
fill
your
pocket
full
of
peas
and
make
a
small
hole
in
it
and
then
if
you
are
carried
away
again
they
will
fall
out
and
leave
a
track
in
the
but
unseen
by
the
king
the
little
man
was
standing
beside
him
when
he
said
that
and
heard
all
at
night
when
the
sleeping
princess
was
again
carried
through
the
streets
some
peas
certainly
did
fall
out
of
her
pocket
but
they
made
no
track
for
the
crafty
little
man
had
just
before
scattered
peas
in
every
other
street
and
again
the
princess
was
compelled
to
do
servant
s
work
until
next
morning
the
king
sent
his
people
out
to
seek
the
track
but
it
was
all
in
vain
for
in
every
street
poor
children
were
sitting
picking
up
peas
and
saying
it
must
have
rained
peas
last
we
must
think
of
something
else
said
the
king
keep
your
shoes
on
when
you
go
to
bed
and
before
you
come
back
from
the
place
where
you
are
taken
hide
one
of
them
there
i
will
soon
find
the
little
black
man
heard
this
plot
and
at
night
when
the
soldier
again
ordered
him
to
bring
the
princess
revealed
it
to
him
and
told
him
that
he
knew
of
no
way
to
overcome
this
stratagem
and
that
if
the
shoe
were
found
in
the
soldier
s
house
it
would
go
badly
with
him
do
what
i
bid
you
replied
the
soldier
and
again
this
third
night
the
princess
was
obliged
to
work
like
a
servant
but
before
she
went
away
she
hid
her
shoe
under
the
bed
next
morning
the
king
had
the
entire
town
searched
for
his
daughter
s
shoe
it
was
found
at
the
soldier
s
and
the
soldier
himself
who
at
the
entreaty
of
the
little
man
had
gone
outside
the
was
soon
brought
back
and
thrown
into
prison
in
his
flight
he
had
forgotten
the
most
valuable
things
he
had
the
blue
light
and
the
gold
and
had
only
one
ducat
in
his
pocket
and
now
loaded
with
chains
he
was
standing
at
the
window
of
his
dungeon
when
he
chanced
to
see
one
of
his
comrades
passing
by
the
soldier
tapped
at
the
pane
of
glass
and
when
this
man
came
up
said
to
him
be
so
kind
as
to
fetch
me
the
small
bundle
i
have
left
lying
in
the
inn
and
i
will
give
you
a
ducat
for
doing
his
comrade
ran
thither
and
brought
him
what
he
wanted
as
soon
as
the
soldier
was
alone
again
he
lighted
his
pipe
and
summoned
the
little
black
man
have
no
fear
said
the
latter
to
his
master
go
wheresoever
they
take
you
and
let
them
do
what
they
will
only
take
the
blue
light
with
next
day
the
soldier
was
tried
and
though
he
had
done
nothing
wicked
the
judge
condemned
him
to
death
when
he
was
led
forth
to
die
he
begged
a
last
favor
of
the
king
what
is
it
asked
the
king
that
i
may
smoke
one
more
pipe
on
my
you
may
smoke
three
answered
the
king
but
do
not
imagine
that
i
will
spare
your
then
the
soldier
pulled
out
his
pipe
and
lighted
it
at
the
blue
light
and
as
soon
as
a
few
wreaths
of
smoke
had
ascended
the
little
man
was
there
with
a
small
cudgel
in
his
hand
and
said
what
does
my
lord
command
strike
down
to
earth
that
false
judge
there
and
his
constable
and
spare
not
the
king
who
has
treated
me
so
then
the
little
man
fell
on
them
like
lightning
darting
this
way
and
that
and
whosoever
was
so
much
as
touched
by
his
cudgel
fell
to
earth
and
did
not
venture
to
stir
again
the
king
was
terrified
he
threw
himself
on
the
soldier
s
mercy
and
begged
merely
to
be
allowed
to
live
he
gave
him
his
kingdom
for
his
own
and
the
princess
to
wife
illustration
the
spindle
the
shuttle
and
the
needle
there
was
once
a
girl
whose
father
and
mother
died
while
she
was
still
a
little
child
all
alone
in
a
small
house
at
the
end
of
the
village
dwelt
her
godmother
who
supported
herself
by
spinning
weaving
and
sewing
the
old
woman
took
the
forlorn
child
to
live
with
her
kept
her
to
her
work
and
educated
her
in
all
that
is
good
when
the
girl
was
fifteen
the
old
woman
became
ill
called
the
child
to
her
bedside
and
said
dear
daughter
i
feel
my
end
drawing
near
i
leave
you
the
little
house
which
will
protect
you
from
wind
and
weather
and
my
spindle
shuttle
and
needle
with
which
you
can
earn
your
then
she
laid
her
hands
on
the
girl
s
head
blessed
her
and
said
only
preserve
the
love
of
god
in
your
heart
and
all
will
go
well
with
thereupon
she
closed
her
eyes
and
when
she
was
laid
in
the
earth
the
maiden
followed
the
coffin
weeping
bitterly
and
paid
her
the
last
mark
of
respect
and
now
the
maiden
lived
quite
alone
in
the
little
house
and
was
industrious
and
span
wove
and
sewed
and
the
blessing
of
the
good
old
woman
was
on
all
that
she
did
it
seemed
as
if
the
flax
in
the
room
increased
of
its
own
accord
and
whenever
she
wove
a
piece
of
cloth
or
carpet
or
had
made
a
shirt
she
at
once
found
a
buyer
who
paid
her
amply
for
it
so
that
she
was
in
want
of
nothing
and
even
had
something
to
share
with
others
about
this
time
the
son
of
the
king
was
traveling
about
the
country
looking
for
a
bride
he
was
not
to
choose
a
poor
one
and
did
not
want
to
have
a
rich
one
so
he
said
she
shall
be
my
wife
who
is
the
poorest
and
at
the
same
time
the
when
he
came
to
the
village
where
the
maiden
dwelt
he
inquired
as
he
did
wherever
he
went
who
was
the
richest
and
also
the
poorest
girl
in
the
place
they
first
named
the
richest
the
poorest
they
said
was
the
girl
who
lived
in
the
small
house
quite
at
the
end
of
the
village
the
rich
girl
was
sitting
in
all
her
splendor
before
the
door
of
her
house
and
when
the
prince
approached
her
she
got
up
went
to
meet
him
and
made
him
a
low
curtsey
he
looked
at
her
said
nothing
and
rode
on
when
he
came
to
the
house
of
the
poor
girl
she
was
not
standing
at
the
door
but
sitting
in
her
little
room
he
stopped
his
horse
and
saw
through
the
window
on
which
the
bright
sun
was
shining
the
girl
sitting
at
her
busily
spinning
she
looked
up
and
when
she
saw
that
the
prince
was
gazing
in
blushed
all
over
her
face
let
her
eyes
fall
and
went
on
spinning
i
do
not
know
whether
just
at
that
moment
the
thread
was
quite
even
but
she
went
on
spinning
until
the
king
s
son
had
ridden
away
again
then
she
stepped
to
the
window
opened
it
and
said
it
is
so
warm
in
this
room
but
she
still
looked
after
him
as
long
as
she
could
see
the
white
feathers
in
his
hat
then
she
sat
down
to
work
again
in
her
own
room
and
went
on
with
her
spinning
and
a
saying
which
the
old
woman
had
often
repeated
when
she
was
sitting
at
her
work
came
into
her
mind
and
she
sang
these
words
to
herself
my
spindle
haste
haste
thee
away
here
to
my
house
bring
the
wooer
i
and
what
do
you
think
happened
the
spindle
sprang
out
of
her
hand
in
an
instant
and
out
of
the
door
and
when
in
her
astonishment
she
got
up
and
looked
after
it
she
saw
that
it
was
dancing
out
merrily
into
the
open
country
and
drawing
a
shining
golden
thread
after
it
before
long
it
had
entirely
vanished
from
her
sight
as
she
had
now
no
spindle
the
girl
took
the
weaver
s
shuttle
in
her
hand
sat
down
to
her
loom
and
began
to
weave
the
spindle
however
danced
continually
onward
and
just
as
the
thread
came
to
an
end
reached
the
prince
what
do
i
see
he
cried
the
spindle
certainly
wants
to
show
me
the
way
he
turned
his
horse
about
and
rode
back
with
the
golden
thread
the
girl
was
however
sitting
at
her
work
singing
my
shuttle
weave
well
this
day
and
guide
the
wooer
to
me
i
immediately
the
shuttle
sprang
out
of
her
hand
and
out
by
the
door
before
the
threshold
however
it
began
to
weave
a
carpet
which
was
more
beautiful
than
the
eyes
of
man
had
ever
yet
beheld
lilies
and
roses
blossomed
on
both
sides
of
it
and
on
a
golden
ground
in
the
centre
green
branches
ascended
under
which
bounded
hares
and
rabbits
stags
and
deer
stretched
their
heads
in
between
them
birds
were
sitting
in
the
branches
above
they
lacked
nothing
but
the
gift
of
song
the
shuttle
leapt
hither
and
thither
and
everything
seemed
to
grow
of
its
own
accord
as
the
shuttle
had
run
away
the
girl
sat
down
to
sew
she
held
the
needle
in
her
hand
and
sang
my
needle
and
fine
prepare
for
a
wooer
this
house
of
then
the
needle
leapt
out
of
her
fingers
and
flew
everywhere
about
the
room
as
quick
as
lightning
it
was
just
as
if
invisible
spirits
were
working
they
covered
tables
and
benches
with
green
cloth
in
an
instant
and
the
chairs
with
velvet
and
hung
the
windows
with
silken
curtains
hardly
had
the
needle
put
in
the
last
stitch
than
the
maiden
saw
through
the
window
the
white
feathers
of
the
prince
whom
the
spindle
had
brought
thither
by
the
golden
thread
he
alighted
stepped
over
the
carpet
into
the
house
and
when
he
entered
the
room
there
stood
the
maiden
in
her
poor
garments
but
she
shone
out
from
them
like
a
rose
surrounded
by
leaves
you
are
the
poorest
and
also
the
richest
said
he
to
her
come
with
me
you
shall
be
my
she
did
not
speak
but
she
gave
him
her
hand
then
he
kissed
her
and
led
her
forth
lifted
her
on
to
his
horse
and
took
her
to
the
royal
castle
where
the
wedding
was
solemnized
with
great
rejoicings
the
spindle
shuttle
and
needle
were
preserved
in
the
and
held
in
great
honor
illustration
the
three
a
father
once
called
his
three
sons
before
him
he
gave
to
the
first
a
cock
to
the
second
a
scythe
and
to
the
third
a
cat
i
am
old
said
he
my
death
is
nigh
and
i
have
wished
to
take
thought
for
you
before
my
end
money
i
have
not
and
what
i
now
give
you
seems
of
little
worth
but
all
depends
on
your
making
a
sensible
use
of
it
only
seek
out
a
country
where
such
things
are
still
unknown
and
your
fortune
is
after
the
father
s
death
the
eldest
went
away
with
his
cock
but
wherever
he
came
the
cock
was
already
known
in
the
towns
he
saw
him
from
a
long
distance
sitting
upon
the
steeples
and
turning
round
with
the
wind
and
in
the
villages
he
heard
more
than
one
crowing
no
one
would
show
any
wonder
at
the
creature
so
that
it
did
not
look
as
if
he
would
make
his
fortune
by
it
illustration
when
the
corn
was
ripe
they
shot
it
down
at
last
however
it
happened
that
he
came
to
an
island
where
the
people
knew
nothing
about
cocks
and
did
not
even
understand
how
to
tell
time
they
certainly
knew
when
it
was
morning
or
evening
but
at
night
if
they
did
not
sleep
through
it
not
one
of
them
knew
how
to
find
out
the
time
look
said
he
what
a
proud
creature
it
has
a
crown
upon
its
head
and
wears
spurs
like
a
knight
it
calls
you
three
times
during
the
night
at
fixed
hours
and
when
it
calls
for
the
last
time
the
sun
soon
after
rises
but
if
it
crows
by
broad
daylight
then
take
notice
for
there
will
certainly
be
a
change
of
the
people
were
well
pleased
for
a
whole
night
they
did
not
sleep
and
listened
with
great
delight
as
the
cock
at
two
four
and
six
o
clock
loudly
and
clearly
proclaimed
the
time
they
asked
if
the
creature
were
for
sale
and
how
much
he
wanted
for
it
about
as
much
gold
as
an
ass
can
carry
answered
he
a
ridiculously
small
price
for
such
a
precious
creature
they
cried
all
together
and
willingly
gave
him
what
he
had
asked
when
he
came
home
with
his
wealth
his
brothers
were
astonished
and
the
second
said
well
i
will
go
forth
and
see
whether
i
can
not
get
rid
of
my
scythe
as
but
it
did
not
look
as
if
he
would
for
laborers
met
him
everywhere
and
they
had
scythes
upon
their
shoulders
as
well
as
he
at
last
however
he
chanced
upon
an
island
where
the
people
knew
nothing
of
scythes
when
the
corn
was
ripe
they
took
cannon
out
to
the
fields
and
shot
it
down
now
this
was
rather
an
uncertain
affair
many
shot
right
over
it
others
hit
the
ears
instead
of
the
stems
and
shot
them
away
whereby
much
was
lost
and
besides
all
this
it
made
a
terrible
noise
so
the
man
set
to
work
and
mowed
it
down
so
quietly
and
quickly
that
the
people
opened
their
mouths
with
astonishment
they
agreed
to
give
him
what
he
wanted
for
the
scythe
and
he
received
a
horse
laden
with
as
much
gold
as
it
could
carry
and
now
the
third
brother
wanted
to
take
his
cat
to
the
right
man
he
fared
just
like
the
others
so
long
as
he
stayed
on
the
mainland
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
every
place
had
cats
and
there
were
so
many
of
them
that
most
kittens
were
drowned
in
the
ponds
at
last
he
sailed
to
an
island
and
it
luckily
happened
that
no
cats
had
ever
yet
been
seen
there
and
that
the
mice
had
got
the
upper
hand
so
much
that
they
danced
upon
the
tables
and
benches
whether
the
master
were
at
home
or
not
the
people
complained
bitterly
of
the
plague
the
king
himself
in
his
palace
did
not
know
how
to
secure
himself
against
them
mice
squeaked
in
every
corner
and
gnawed
whatever
they
could
lay
hold
of
with
their
teeth
but
now
the
cat
began
her
chase
and
soon
cleared
a
couple
of
rooms
and
the
people
begged
the
king
to
buy
the
wonderful
beast
for
the
country
the
king
willingly
gave
what
was
asked
which
was
a
mule
laden
with
gold
and
the
third
brother
came
home
with
the
greatest
treasure
of
all
the
cat
made
merry
with
the
mice
in
the
royal
palace
and
killed
so
many
that
they
could
not
be
counted
at
last
she
grew
warm
with
the
work
and
thirsty
so
she
stood
still
lifted
up
her
head
and
cried
mew
mew
when
they
heard
this
strange
cry
the
king
and
all
his
people
were
frightened
and
in
their
terror
ran
out
of
the
palace
then
the
king
took
counsel
what
was
best
to
be
done
at
last
it
was
decided
to
send
a
herald
to
the
cat
and
command
her
to
leave
the
palace
if
not
she
was
to
expect
that
force
would
be
used
against
her
the
councilors
said
we
would
rather
be
plagued
with
mice
to
which
misfortune
we
are
accustomed
than
give
up
our
lives
to
such
a
monster
as
a
noble
youth
therefore
was
sent
to
ask
the
cat
whether
she
would
peaceably
quit
the
but
the
cat
whose
thirst
had
become
still
greater
answered
again
mew
mew
the
youth
thought
that
she
said
most
certainly
not
most
certainly
not
and
took
this
answer
to
the
king
then
said
the
councilors
she
must
yield
to
cannon
were
brought
out
and
the
palace
was
soon
in
flames
when
the
fire
reached
the
room
where
the
cat
was
sitting
she
sprang
safely
out
of
the
window
but
the
besiegers
did
not
leave
off
until
the
whole
palace
was
shot
down
to
the
ground
illustration
the
donkey
cabbages
there
was
once
a
young
huntsman
who
went
into
the
forest
to
lie
in
wait
he
had
a
fresh
and
joyous
heart
and
as
he
was
going
thither
whistling
upon
a
leaf
an
ugly
old
crone
came
up
who
spoke
to
him
and
said
dear
huntsman
truly
you
are
merry
and
contented
but
i
am
suffering
from
hunger
and
thirst
do
give
me
an
the
huntsman
had
compassion
on
the
poor
old
creature
felt
in
his
pocket
and
gave
her
what
he
could
afford
he
was
then
about
to
go
further
but
the
old
woman
stopped
him
and
said
listen
dear
huntsman
to
what
i
tell
you
i
will
make
you
a
present
in
return
for
your
kindness
go
on
your
way
now
but
in
a
little
while
you
will
come
to
a
tree
whereon
nine
birds
are
sitting
which
have
a
cloak
in
their
claws
and
are
plucking
at
it
take
your
gun
and
shoot
into
the
midst
of
them
they
will
let
the
cloak
fall
down
to
you
but
one
of
the
birds
will
be
hurt
and
will
drop
dead
carry
away
the
cloak
it
is
a
when
you
throw
it
over
your
shoulders
you
only
have
to
wish
to
be
in
a
certain
place
and
you
will
be
there
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
take
out
the
heart
of
the
dead
bird
swallow
it
whole
and
every
morning
early
when
you
get
up
you
will
find
a
gold
piece
under
your
the
huntsman
thanked
the
wise
woman
and
thought
to
himself
those
are
fine
things
that
she
has
promised
me
if
all
does
but
come
true
and
verily
when
he
had
walked
about
a
hundred
paces
he
heard
in
the
branches
above
him
a
screaming
and
twittering
he
looked
up
and
saw
a
crowd
of
birds
who
were
tearing
a
piece
of
cloth
with
their
beaks
and
claws
and
tugging
and
fighting
as
if
each
wanted
to
have
it
all
to
himself
well
said
the
huntsman
this
is
wonderful
it
has
come
to
pass
just
as
the
old
wife
foretold
and
he
took
the
gun
from
his
shoulder
aimed
and
fired
right
into
the
midst
of
them
so
that
the
feathers
flew
about
the
birds
instantly
took
to
flight
with
loud
outcries
but
one
dropped
down
dead
and
the
cloak
fell
at
the
same
time
then
the
huntsman
did
as
the
old
woman
had
directed
him
cut
open
the
bird
sought
the
heart
swallowed
it
down
and
took
the
cloak
home
with
him
next
morning
when
he
awoke
the
promise
occurred
to
him
he
wished
to
see
if
it
also
had
been
fulfilled
when
he
lifted
up
the
pillow
the
gold
piece
shone
in
his
eyes
the
next
day
he
found
another
and
so
it
went
on
every
time
he
got
up
he
gathered
together
a
heap
of
gold
but
at
last
he
thought
of
what
use
is
all
my
gold
to
me
if
i
stay
at
home
i
will
go
forth
and
see
the
he
then
took
leave
of
his
parents
buckled
on
his
huntsman
s
pouch
and
gun
and
went
out
into
the
world
it
came
to
pass
that
one
day
he
traveled
through
a
dense
forest
and
when
he
came
to
the
end
of
it
in
the
plain
before
him
was
a
fine
castle
an
old
woman
was
standing
with
a
wonderfully
beautiful
maiden
looking
out
of
one
of
the
windows
the
old
woman
however
was
a
witch
and
said
to
the
maiden
there
comes
a
man
out
of
the
forest
who
has
a
wonderful
treasure
in
his
body
we
must
filch
it
from
him
my
dear
daughter
it
is
more
suitable
for
us
than
for
him
he
has
a
bird
s
heart
about
him
by
means
of
which
every
morning
a
gold
piece
lies
under
his
she
told
her
what
she
was
to
do
to
get
it
and
what
part
she
had
to
play
and
finally
threatened
her
and
said
with
angry
eyes
and
if
you
do
not
attend
to
what
i
say
it
will
be
the
worse
for
now
when
the
huntsman
came
nearer
he
descried
the
maiden
and
said
to
himself
i
have
traveled
about
for
such
a
long
time
i
will
take
a
rest
for
once
and
enter
that
beautiful
castle
i
have
certainly
money
nevertheless
the
real
reason
was
that
he
had
caught
sight
of
the
pretty
maiden
he
entered
the
house
and
was
well
received
and
courteously
entertained
before
long
he
was
so
much
in
love
with
the
young
witch
that
he
no
longer
thought
of
anything
else
and
saw
things
as
she
saw
them
and
did
what
she
desired
the
old
woman
then
said
now
we
must
have
the
bird
s
heart
he
will
never
miss
she
prepared
a
drink
and
when
it
was
ready
poured
it
into
a
cup
and
gave
it
to
the
maiden
who
was
to
present
it
to
the
huntsman
she
did
so
saying
now
my
dearest
drink
to
so
he
took
the
cup
and
when
he
had
swallowed
the
draught
he
brought
up
the
heart
of
the
bird
the
girl
had
to
take
it
away
secretly
and
swallow
it
herself
for
the
old
woman
would
have
it
so
thenceforward
he
found
no
more
gold
under
his
pillow
but
it
lay
instead
under
that
of
the
maiden
from
whence
the
old
woman
fetched
it
away
every
morning
but
he
was
so
much
in
love
and
so
befooled
that
he
thought
of
nothing
else
but
of
passing
his
time
with
the
maiden
then
the
old
witch
said
we
have
the
bird
s
heart
but
we
must
also
take
the
away
from
the
maiden
answered
we
will
leave
him
that
he
has
lost
his
the
old
woman
was
angry
and
said
such
a
mantle
is
a
wonderful
thing
and
is
seldom
to
be
found
in
this
world
i
must
and
will
have
it
she
gave
the
maiden
several
blows
and
said
that
if
she
did
not
obey
it
should
fare
ill
with
her
so
she
did
the
old
woman
s
bidding
placed
herself
at
the
window
and
looked
on
the
distant
country
as
if
she
were
very
sorrowful
the
huntsman
asked
why
do
you
stand
there
so
sorrowfully
ah
my
beloved
was
her
answer
over
yonder
lies
the
garnet
mountain
where
the
precious
stones
grow
i
long
for
them
so
much
that
when
i
think
of
them
i
feel
quite
sad
but
who
can
get
them
only
the
birds
they
fly
and
can
reach
them
but
a
man
have
you
nothing
else
to
complain
of
said
the
huntsman
i
will
soon
remove
that
burden
from
your
with
that
he
drew
her
under
his
mantle
wished
himself
on
the
garnet
mountain
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
they
were
sitting
on
it
together
precious
stones
were
glistening
on
every
side
so
that
it
was
a
joy
to
see
them
together
they
gathered
the
finest
and
costliest
of
them
now
the
old
woman
had
through
her
sorceries
contrived
that
the
eyes
of
the
huntsman
should
become
heavy
he
said
to
the
maiden
we
will
sit
down
and
rest
a
while
i
am
so
tired
that
i
can
no
longer
stand
on
my
then
they
sat
down
and
he
laid
his
head
in
her
lap
and
fell
asleep
when
he
was
asleep
she
unfastened
the
mantle
from
his
shoulders
and
wrapped
herself
in
it
picked
up
the
garnets
and
stones
and
wished
herself
back
at
home
with
them
but
when
the
huntsman
had
had
his
sleep
out
he
awoke
and
perceived
that
his
sweetheart
had
betrayed
him
and
left
him
alone
on
the
wild
mountain
then
he
said
oh
what
treachery
there
is
in
the
world
and
sat
there
in
care
and
sorrow
not
knowing
what
to
do
but
the
mountain
belonged
to
some
wild
and
monstrous
giants
who
dwelt
thereon
and
lived
their
lives
there
and
he
had
not
sat
long
before
he
saw
three
of
them
coming
toward
him
the
giants
came
up
and
the
first
kicked
him
with
his
foot
and
said
what
sort
of
an
earthworm
is
lying
curled
up
here
the
second
said
step
upon
him
and
kill
but
the
third
said
would
that
be
worth
your
while
let
him
live
he
can
not
remain
here
when
he
climbs
higher
toward
the
summit
of
the
mountain
the
clouds
will
lay
hold
of
him
and
bear
him
so
saying
they
passed
by
but
the
huntsman
had
paid
heed
to
their
words
and
as
soon
as
they
were
gone
he
rose
and
climbed
up
to
the
summit
of
the
mountain
and
when
he
had
sat
there
a
while
a
cloud
floated
toward
him
caught
him
up
carried
him
away
and
traveled
about
for
a
long
time
in
the
heavens
then
it
sank
lower
and
let
itself
down
on
a
great
girt
round
by
walls
so
that
he
came
softly
to
the
ground
on
cabbages
and
vegetables
then
the
huntsman
looked
about
him
and
said
if
i
only
had
something
to
eat
i
am
so
hungry
and
my
hunger
will
grow
greater
but
i
see
here
neither
apples
nor
pears
nor
any
other
sort
of
fruit
everywhere
there
is
nothing
but
at
length
he
thought
at
a
pinch
i
can
eat
some
of
the
leaves
they
do
not
taste
particularly
good
but
they
will
refresh
with
that
he
picked
himself
out
a
fine
head
of
cabbage
and
ate
it
but
scarcely
had
he
swallowed
a
couple
of
mouthfuls
when
wonderful
he
felt
quite
changed
four
legs
grew
on
him
a
large
head
and
two
thick
ears
and
he
saw
with
horror
that
he
was
changed
into
a
donkey
still
as
his
hunger
became
greater
every
minute
and
as
the
juicy
leaves
were
suitable
to
his
present
nature
he
went
on
eating
with
great
zest
at
last
he
arrived
at
a
different
kind
of
cabbage
but
as
soon
as
he
had
swallowed
it
he
again
felt
a
change
and
resumed
his
human
shape
then
the
huntsman
lay
down
and
slept
off
his
fatigue
when
he
awoke
next
morning
he
broke
off
one
head
of
the
bad
cabbages
and
another
of
the
good
ones
and
thought
to
himself
this
shall
help
me
to
get
my
own
again
and
punish
then
he
took
the
cabbages
with
him
climbed
over
the
wall
and
went
forth
to
seek
for
the
castle
of
his
sweetheart
after
wandering
about
for
a
couple
of
days
he
was
lucky
enough
to
find
it
again
he
dyed
his
face
brown
so
that
his
own
mother
would
not
have
known
him
and
begged
for
shelter
i
am
so
tired
said
he
that
i
can
go
no
the
witch
asked
who
are
you
countryman
and
what
is
your
business
said
he
i
have
been
so
fortunate
as
to
find
the
most
wonderful
salad
which
grows
under
the
sun
and
am
carrying
it
about
with
when
the
old
woman
heard
of
the
exquisite
salad
she
was
greedy
and
said
dear
countryman
let
me
just
taste
this
wonderful
why
not
answered
he
i
have
brought
two
heads
with
me
and
will
give
you
one
of
them
and
he
opened
his
pouch
and
handed
her
the
bad
cabbage
the
witch
suspected
nothing
amiss
and
her
mouth
watered
so
for
this
new
dish
that
she
herself
went
into
the
kitchen
and
prepared
it
when
it
was
ready
she
could
not
wait
until
it
was
set
on
the
table
but
took
a
couple
of
leaves
at
once
and
put
them
in
her
mouth
hardly
had
she
swallowed
them
than
she
was
deprived
of
her
human
shape
and
she
ran
out
into
the
courtyard
in
the
form
of
a
donkey
presently
the
entered
the
kitchen
saw
the
salad
standing
there
ready
prepared
and
was
about
to
carry
it
up
but
on
the
way
according
to
habit
she
was
seized
by
the
desire
to
taste
and
she
ate
a
couple
of
leaves
instantly
the
magic
power
showed
itself
and
she
likewise
became
a
donkey
and
ran
out
to
the
old
woman
and
the
dish
of
salad
fell
to
the
ground
meantime
the
huntsman
sat
beside
the
beautiful
maiden
and
as
no
one
came
with
the
salad
and
she
also
was
longing
for
it
she
said
i
don
t
know
what
has
become
of
the
the
huntsman
thought
the
salad
must
have
already
taken
effect
and
said
i
will
go
to
the
kitchen
and
inquire
about
as
he
went
down
he
saw
the
two
donkeys
running
about
in
the
courtyard
the
salad
however
was
lying
on
the
ground
all
right
said
he
the
two
have
taken
their
portion
and
he
picked
up
the
other
leaves
laid
them
on
the
dish
and
carried
them
to
the
maiden
i
bring
you
the
delicate
food
myself
said
he
in
order
that
you
may
not
have
to
wait
then
she
ate
of
it
and
was
like
the
others
immediately
deprived
of
her
human
form
and
ran
out
into
the
courtyard
in
the
shape
of
a
donkey
after
the
huntsman
had
washed
his
face
so
that
the
transformed
ones
could
recognize
him
he
went
down
into
the
courtyard
and
said
now
you
shall
receive
the
wages
of
your
treachery
and
bound
them
together
all
three
with
one
rope
and
drove
them
along
until
he
came
to
a
mill
he
knocked
at
the
window
the
miller
put
out
his
head
and
asked
what
he
wanted
i
have
three
unmanageable
beasts
answered
he
which
i
don
t
want
to
keep
any
longer
will
you
take
them
in
and
give
them
food
and
stable
room
and
manage
them
as
i
tell
you
then
i
will
pay
you
what
you
the
miller
said
why
not
but
how
am
i
to
manage
them
the
huntsman
then
said
that
he
was
to
give
three
beatings
and
one
meal
daily
to
the
old
donkey
and
that
was
the
witch
one
beating
and
three
meals
to
the
younger
one
which
was
the
and
to
the
youngest
which
was
the
maiden
no
beatings
and
three
meals
for
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
have
the
maiden
beaten
after
that
he
went
back
into
the
castle
and
found
therein
everything
he
needed
after
a
couple
of
days
the
miller
came
and
said
he
must
inform
him
that
the
old
donkey
which
had
received
three
beatings
and
only
one
meal
daily
was
dead
the
two
others
he
continued
are
certainly
not
dead
and
are
fed
three
times
daily
but
they
are
so
sad
that
they
can
not
last
much
the
huntsman
was
moved
to
pity
put
away
his
anger
and
told
the
miller
to
drive
them
back
again
to
him
and
when
they
came
he
gave
them
some
of
the
good
salad
so
that
they
became
human
again
the
beautiful
maiden
fell
on
her
knees
before
him
and
said
ah
my
beloved
forgive
me
for
the
evil
i
have
done
you
my
mother
drove
me
to
it
it
was
done
against
my
will
for
i
love
you
dearly
your
hangs
in
a
cupboard
and
as
for
the
bird
i
will
take
a
potion
and
bring
it
up
but
he
thought
otherwise
and
said
keep
it
it
is
all
the
same
for
i
will
take
you
for
my
true
so
the
wedding
was
celebrated
and
they
lived
happily
together

death

illustration
the
iron
stove
in
the
days
when
wishing
was
having
a
king
s
son
was
enchanted
by
an
old
witch
and
shut
up
in
an
iron
stove
in
a
forest
there
he
passed
many
years
and
no
one
could
deliver
him
then
a
king
s
daughter
came
into
the
forest
who
had
lost
herself
and
could
not
find
her
father
s
kingdom
again
after
she
had
wandered
about
for
nine
days
she
at
length
came
to
the
iron
stove
then
a
voice
issued
from
it
and
asked
her
whence
come
you
and
whither
go
you
she
answered
i
have
lost
my
father
s
kingdom
and
can
not
get
home
then
a
voice
inside
the
iron
stove
said
i
will
help
you
to
get
home
and
that
indeed
most
swiftly
if
you
will
promise
to
do
what
i
desire
of
you
i
am
the
son
of
a
far
greater
king
than
your
father
and
i
will
marry
then
was
she
afraid
and
thought
alas
what
use
could
i
have
with
an
iron
stove
but
as
she
much
wished
to
get
home
to
her
father
she
promised
to
do
as
he
desired
he
said
you
shall
return
here
and
bring
a
knife
with
you
and
scrape
a
hole
in
the
then
he
gave
her
a
companion
who
walked
near
her
but
did
not
speak
in
two
hours
he
took
her
home
there
was
great
joy
in
the
castle
when
the
king
s
daughter
came
back
and
the
old
king
fell
on
her
neck
and
kissed
her
she
however
was
sorely
troubled
and
said
dear
father
what
i
have
suffered
i
should
never
have
got
home
again
from
the
great
wild
forest
if
i
had
not
come
to
an
iron
stove
but
i
have
been
forced
to
give
my
word
that
i
will
go
back
to
it
set
it
free
and
marry
then
the
old
king
was
so
terrified
that
he
all
but
fainted
for
he
had
only
this
one
daughter
they
therefore
resolved
they
would
send
in
her
place
the
miller
s
daughter
who
was
very
beautiful
they
took
her
there
gave
her
a
knife
and
said
she
was
to
scrape
at
the
iron
stove
so
she
scraped
at
it
for
hours
but
could
not
bring
off
the
least
morsel
of
it
when
day
dawned
a
voice
in
the
stove
said
it
seems
to
me
it
is
day
then
she
answered
it
seems
so
to
me
too
i
fancy
i
hear
the
noise
of
my
father
s
so
you
are
a
miller
s
daughter
then
go
your
way
at
once
let
the
king
s
daughter
come
she
went
away
at
once
and
told
the
old
king
that
the
man
outside
there
would
have
none
of
her
he
wanted
the
king
s
daughter
they
however
still
had
a
swineherd
s
daughter
who
was
even
prettier
than
the
miller
s
daughter
and
they
determined
to
give
her
a
piece
of
gold
to
go
to
the
iron
stove
instead
of
the
king
s
daughter
so
she
was
taken
thither
and
she
also
had
to
scrape
for
hours
she
likewise
made
nothing
of
it
when
day
broke
a
voice
inside
the
stove
cried
it
seems
to
me
it
is
day
outside
then
answered
she
so
it
seems
to
me
i
fancy
i
hear
my
father
s
horn
then
you
are
a
swineherd
s
daughter
go
away
at
once
tell
the
king
s
daughter
to
come
and
tell
her
all
must
be
done
as
was
promised
and
if
she
does
not
come
everything
in
the
kingdom
shall
be
ruined
and
destroyed
and
not
one
stone
be
left
standing
on
when
the
king
s
daughter
heard
that
she
began
to
weep
but
now
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
keep
her
promise
so
she
took
leave
of
her
father
put
a
knife
in
her
pocket
and
went
forth
to
the
iron
stove
in
the
forest
when
she
got
there
she
began
to
scrape
and
the
iron
gave
way
and
when
two
hours
were
over
she
had
already
scraped
a
small
hole
then
she
peeped
in
and
saw
a
youth
so
handsome
and
so
brilliant
with
gold
and
with
precious
jewels
that
her
very
soul
was
delighted
therefore
she
went
on
scraping
and
made
the
hole
so
large
that
he
was
able
to
get
out
then
said
he
you
are
mine
and
i
am
yours
you
are
my
bride
and
have
released
he
wanted
to
take
her
away
with
him
to
his
kingdom
but
she
entreated
him
to
let
her
go
once
again
to
her
father
the
king
s
son
allowed
her
to
do
so
but
she
was
not
to
say
more
to
her
father
than
three
words
and
then
she
was
to
come
back
again
so
she
went
home
but
she
spoke
more
than
three
words
and
instantly
the
iron
stove
disappeared
and
was
taken
far
away
over
glass
mountains
and
piercing
swords
but
the
king
s
son
was
set
free
and
no
longer
shut
up
in
it
after
this
she
bade
to
her
father
took
some
money
with
her
but
not
much
and
went
back
to
the
great
forest
and
looked
for
the
iron
stove
but
it
was
nowhere
to
be
found
for
nine
days
she
sought
it
then
her
hunger
grew
so
great
that
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
for
she
could
no
longer
live
when
it
was
evening
she
seated
herself
in
a
small
tree
and
made
up
her
mind
to
spend
the
night
there
as
she
was
afraid
of
wild
beasts
when
midnight
drew
near
she
saw
in
the
distance
a
small
light
and
thought
ah
there
i
may
be
saved
she
got
down
from
the
tree
and
went
toward
the
light
and
on
the
way
she
prayed
then
she
came
to
a
little
old
house
and
much
grass
had
grown
all
about
it
and
a
small
heap
of
wood
lay
in
front
of
it
she
thought
ah
whither
have
i
come
and
peeped
in
through
the
window
but
she
saw
nothing
inside
but
toads
big
and
little
except
a
table
covered
with
wine
and
roast
meat
while
the
plates
and
glasses
were
of
silver
then
she
took
courage
and
knocked
at
the
door
the
fat
toad
cried
green
with
the
limping
leg
little
dog
of
the
limping
leg
hop
hither
and
thither
and
quickly
see
who
is
without
and
a
small
toad
came
along
and
opened
the
door
to
her
illustration
then
the
king
s
daughter
came
to
a
little
house
when
she
entered
they
all
bade
her
welcome
and
she
was
forced
to
sit
down
they
asked
where
have
you
come
from
and
whither
are
you
going
then
she
related
all
that
had
befallen
her
and
how
because
she
had
disobeyed
the
order
which
had
been
given
her
not
to
say
more
than
three
words
the
stove
and
the
king
s
son
also
had
disappeared
and
now
she
was
seeking
him
over
hill
and
dale
until
she
found
him
at
that
the
old
fat
one
said
green
with
the
limping
leg
little
dog
of
the
limping
leg
hop
hither
and
thither
and
bring
me
the
great
then
the
little
one
went
and
brought
the
box
after
this
they
gave
her
meat
and
drink
and
took
her
to
a
bed
which
felt
like
silk
and
velvet
she
laid
herself
therein
in
god
s
name
and
slept
when
morning
came
she
arose
and
the
old
toad
gave
her
three
needles
out
of
the
great
box
which
she
was
to
take
with
her
they
would
be
needed
by
her
for
she
had
to
cross
a
high
glass
mountain
and
go
over
three
piercing
swords
and
a
great
lake
if
she
did
all
this
she
would
get
her
lover
back
again
then
she
gave
her
three
things
which
she
was
to
take
the
greatest
care
of
namely
three
large
needles
a
and
three
nuts
with
these
she
traveled
onwards
and
when
she
came
to
the
glass
mountain
which
was
so
slippery
she
stuck
the
three
needles
first
behind
her
feet
and
then
before
them
and
so
got
over
it
and
when
she
was
over
it
she
hid
them
in
a
place
which
she
marked
carefully
after
this
she
came
to
the
three
piercing
swords
and
then
she
seated
herself
on
her
and
rolled
over
them
at
last
she
arrived
in
front
of
a
great
lake
and
when
she
had
crossed
it
she
came
to
a
large
and
beautiful
castle
she
went
in
and
asked
for
a
place
she
knew
however
that
the
king
s
son
whom
she
had
released
from
the
iron
stove
in
the
great
forest
was
in
the
castle
then
she
was
taken
as
a
at
low
wages
but
already
the
king
s
son
had
another
maiden
by
his
side
whom
he
wanted
to
marry
for
he
thought
that
she
had
long
been
dead
in
the
evening
when
she
had
washed
up
and
was
done
she
felt
in
her
pocket
and
found
the
three
nuts
which
the
old
toad
had
given
her
she
cracked
one
with
her
teeth
and
was
going
to
eat
the
kernel
when
lo
and
behold
there
was
a
stately
royal
garment
in
it
but
when
the
bride
heard
of
this
she
came
and
asked
for
the
dress
and
wanted
to
buy
it
and
said
it
is
not
a
dress
for
a
she
said
no
she
would
not
sell
it
but
if
the
bride
would
grant
her
one
thing
she
should
have
it
and
that
was
leave
to
sleep
one
night
in
her
bridegroom
s
chamber
the
bride
gave
her
permission
because
the
dress
was
so
pretty
and
she
had
never
had
one
like
it
when
it
was
evening
she
said
to
her
bridegroom
that
silly
girl
will
sleep
in
your
if
you
are
willing
so
am
i
said
he
she
however
gave
him
a
glass
of
wine
in
which
she
had
poured
a
so
the
bridegroom
and
the
went
to
sleep
in
the
room
and
he
slept
so
soundly
that
she
could
not
waken
him
she
wept
the
whole
night
and
cried
i
set
you
free
when
you
were
in
an
iron
stove
in
the
wild
forest
i
sought
you
and
walked
over
a
glass
mountain
and
three
sharp
swords
and
a
great
lake
before
i
found
you
and
yet
you
will
not
hear
me
the
servants
sat
by
the
and
heard
how
she
thus
wept
the
whole
night
through
and
in
the
morning
they
told
it
to
their
lord
and
the
next
evening
when
she
had
washed
up
she
opened
the
second
nut
and
a
far
more
beautiful
dress
was
within
it
when
the
bride
beheld
it
she
wished
to
buy
that
also
but
the
girl
would
not
take
money
and
begged
that
she
might
once
again
sleep
in
the
bridegroom
s
chamber
the
bride
however
gave
him
a
and
he
slept
so
soundly
that
he
could
hear
nothing
but
the
wept
the
whole
night
long
and
cried
i
set
you
free
when
you
were
in
an
iron
stove
in
the
wild
forest
i
sought
you
and
walked
over
a
glass
mountain
and
over
three
sharp
swords
and
a
great
lake
before
i
found
you
and
yet
you
will
not
hear
me
the
servants
sat
by
the
and
heard
her
weeping
the
whole
night
through
and
in
the
morning
informed
their
lord
of
it
and
on
the
third
evening
when
she
had
washed
up
she
opened
the
third
nut
and
within
it
was
a
still
more
beautiful
dress
which
was
stiff
with
pure
gold
when
the
bride
saw
that
she
wanted
to
have
it
but
the
maiden
gave
it
up
only
on
condition
that
she
might
for
the
third
time
sleep
in
the
bridegroom
s
apartment
the
king
s
son
was
however
on
his
guard
and
threw
the
away
now
therefore
when
she
began
to
weep
and
to
cry
dearest
love
i
set
you
free
when
you
were
in
the
iron
stove
in
the
terrible
wild
forest
the
king
s
son
leapt
up
and
said
you
are
the
true
one
you
are
mine
and
i
am
thereupon
while
it
was
still
night
he
got
into
a
carriage
with
her
and
they
took
away
the
false
bride
s
clothes
so
that
she
could
not
get
up
when
they
came
to
the
great
lake
they
sailed
across
it
and
when
they
reached
the
three
swords
they
seated
themselves
on
the
and
when
they
got
to
the
glass
mountain
they
thrust
the
three
needles
in
it
and
so
at
length
they
reached
the
little
old
house
but
when
they
went
inside
that
it
was
a
great
castle
and
the
toads
were
all
disenchanted
and
were
king
s
children
and
full
of
happiness
then
the
wedding
was
celebrated
and
the
king
s
son
and
the
princess
remained
in
the
castle
which
was
much
larger
than
the
castles
of
their
fathers
but
as
the
old
king
grieved
at
being
left
alone
they
fetched
him
away
and
brought
him
to
live
with
them
and
they
had
two
kingdoms
and
lived
together
happily
ever
afterward

sweet
porridge
there
was
a
poor
good
little
girl
who
lived
alone
with
her
mother
and
they
had
nothing
more
to
eat
so
the
child
went
into
the
forest
and
an
old
woman
met
her
who
knew
of
her
sorrow
and
gave
her
a
little
pot
which
when
she
said
little
pot
boil
would
cook
good
sweet
porridge
and
when
she
said
little
pot
stop
it
ceased
to
cook
the
little
girl
took
the
pot
home
to
her
mother
and
now
they
were
freed
from
their
poverty
and
hunger
and
ate
sweet
porridge
as
often
as
they
liked
once
on
a
time
when
the
little
girl
had
gone
out
the
mother
said
little
pot
boil
and
it
began
to
cook
and
she
ate
till
she
was
satisfied
then
she
wanted
the
pot
to
stop
cooking
but
did
not
know
the
word
so
it
went
on
cooking
and
the
porridge
rose
over
the
edge
and
still
it
cooked
on
till
the
kitchen
and
the
whole
house
was
full
and
then
the
next
house
and
then
the
whole
street
just
as
if
it
wanted
to
satisfy
the
hunger
of
the
whole
world
and
there
was
the
greatest
trouble
and
no
one
knew
how
to
stop
it
at
last
when
only
a
single
house
was
left
the
child
came
home
and
just
said
little
pot
stop
and
it
stopped
cooking
and
whosoever
wished
to
return
to
the
town
had
to
eat
his
way
back

and
there
was
once
a
poor
widow
who
lived
in
a
lonely
cottage
in
front
of
the
cottage
was
a
garden
wherein
stood
two
one
of
which
bore
white
and
the
other
red
roses
she
had
two
children
who
were
like
the
two
one
was
called
and
the
other
they
were
as
good
and
happy
as
busy
and
cheerful
as
ever
two
children
in
the
world
were
only
was
more
quiet
and
gentle
than
liked
better
to
run
about
in
the
meadows
and
fields
seeking
flowers
and
catching
butterflies
but
sat
at
home
with
her
mother
and
helped
her
with
the
housework
or
read
to
her
when
there
was
nothing
to
do
the
two
children
were
so
fond
of
each
other
that
they
always
held
each
other
by
the
hand
when
they
went
out
together
when
said
we
will
not
leave
each
other
answered
never
so
long
as
we
and
their
mother
would
add
what
one
has
she
must
share
with
the
they
often
ran
about
the
forest
alone
and
gathered
red
berries
beasts
never
did
them
any
harm
but
came
close
to
them
trustfully
the
little
hare
would
eat
a
out
of
their
hands
the
roe
grazed
by
their
side
the
stag
leapt
merrily
by
them
and
the
birds
sat
still
upon
the
boughs
and
sang
whatever
they
knew
no
mishap
overtook
them
if
they
stayed
too
late
in
the
forest
and
night
came
on
they
laid
themselves
down
near
one
another
upon
the
moss
and
slept
until
morning
their
mother
knew
this
and
had
no
worry
on
their
account
one
day
when
they
had
spent
the
night
in
the
wood
and
the
dawn
had
roused
them
they
saw
a
beautiful
child
in
a
shining
white
dress
sitting
near
their
bed
he
got
up
and
looked
quite
kindly
at
them
but
said
nothing
and
went
away
into
the
forest
and
when
they
looked
round
they
found
that
they
had
been
sleeping
quite
close
to
a
precipice
and
would
certainly
have
fallen
into
it
in
the
darkness
if
they
had
gone
only
a
few
paces
farther
and
their
mother
told
them
that
it
must
have
been
the
angel
who
watches
over
good
children
and
kept
their
mother
s
little
cottage
so
neat
that
it
was
a
pleasure
to
look
inside
it
in
the
summer
took
care
of
the
house
and
every
morning
laid
a
wreath
of
flowers
by
her
mother
s
bed
before
she
awoke
in
which
was
a
rose
from
each
tree
in
the
winter
lit
the
fire
and
hung
the
kettle
on
the
hook
the
kettle
was
of
copper
and
shone
like
gold
so
brightly
was
it
polished
in
the
evening
when
the
snowflakes
fell
the
mother
said
go
and
bolt
the
door
and
then
they
sat
round
the
hearth
and
the
mother
took
her
spectacles
and
read
aloud
out
of
a
large
book
the
two
girls
listened
as
they
sat
and
span
and
close
by
them
lay
a
lamb
upon
the
floor
and
behind
them
upon
a
perch
sat
a
white
dove
with
its
head
hidden
beneath
its
wings
one
evening
as
they
were
thus
sitting
comfortably
together
some
one
knocked
at
the
door
as
if
he
wished
to
be
let
in
the
mother
said
quick
open
the
door
it
must
be
a
traveler
who
is
seeking
went
and
pushed
back
the
bolt
thinking
that
it
was
a
poor
man
but
it
was
not
it
was
a
bear
that
stretched
his
broad
black
head
within
the
door
screamed
and
sprang
back
the
lamb
bleated
the
dove
fluttered
and
hid
herself
behind
her
mother
s
bed
but
the
bear
began
to
speak
and
said
do
not
be
afraid
i
will
do
you
no
harm
i
am
and
only
want
to
warm
myself
a
little
beside
poor
bear
said
the
mother
lie
down
by
the
fire
only
take
care
that
you
do
not
burn
your
then
she
cried
come
out
the
bear
will
do
you
no
harm
he
means
so
they
both
came
out
and
the
lamb
and
dove
came
nearer
and
were
not
afraid
of
him
the
bear
said
here
children
knock
the
snow
out
of
my
coat
a
little
so
they
brought
the
broom
and
swept
the
bear
s
hide
clean
and
he
stretched
himself
by
the
fire
and
growled
contentedly
and
comfortably
it
was
not
long
before
they
grew
quite
at
home
and
played
tricks
with
their
clumsy
guest
they
tugged
at
his
hair
with
their
hands
put
their
feet
upon
his
back
and
rolled
him
about
or
they
took
a
and
beat
him
and
when
he
growled
they
laughed
but
the
bear
took
it
all
in
good
part
only
when
they
were
too
rough
he
called
out
leave
me
alive
children
you
beat
your
lover
dead
when
it
was
bedtime
and
the
others
went
to
sleep
the
mother
said
to
the
bear
you
may
lie
there
by
the
hearth
and
then
you
will
be
safe
from
the
cold
and
the
bad
as
soon
as
day
dawned
the
two
children
let
him
out
and
he
trotted
across
the
snow
into
the
forest
henceforth
the
bear
came
every
evening
at
the
same
time
laid
himself
down
by
the
hearth
and
let
the
children
amuse
themselves
with
him
as
much
as
they
liked
they
got
so
used
to
him
that
the
doors
were
never
fastened
until
their
black
friend
had
arrived
when
spring
was
come
and
all
outside
was
green
the
bear
said
one
morning
to
now
i
must
go
away
and
can
not
come
back
for
the
whole
where
are
you
going
then
dear
bear
asked
i
must
go
into
the
forest
and
guard
my
treasures
from
the
wicked
dwarfs
in
the
winter
when
the
earth
is
frozen
hard
they
are
obliged
to
stay
below
and
can
not
work
their
way
through
but
now
when
the
sun
has
thawed
and
warmed
the
earth
they
break
through
it
and
come
out
to
pry
and
steal
and
what
once
gets
into
their
hands
and
in
their
caves
does
not
easily
see
daylight
was
very
sorry
for
his
going
away
and
as
she
unbolted
the
door
for
him
and
the
bear
was
hurrying
out
he
caught
against
the
bolt
and
a
piece
of
his
hairy
coat
was
torn
off
it
seemed
to
as
if
she
saw
gold
shining
through
it
but
she
was
not
sure
about
it
the
bear
ran
away
quickly
and
was
soon
out
of
sight
behind
the
trees
a
short
time
afterward
the
mother
sent
her
children
into
the
forest
to
get
there
they
found
a
big
tree
which
lay
felled
on
the
ground
and
close
by
the
trunk
something
was
jumping
backward
and
forward
in
the
grass
but
they
could
not
make
out
what
it
was
when
they
came
nearer
they
saw
a
dwarf
with
an
old
withered
face
and
a
beard
a
yard
long
the
end
of
the
beard
was
caught
in
a
crevice
of
the
tree
and
the
little
fellow
was
jumping
backward
and
forward
like
a
dog
tied
to
a
rope
and
did
not
know
what
to
do
he
glared
at
the
girls
with
his
fiery
red
eyes
and
cried
why
do
you
stand
there
can
you
not
come
here
and
help
me
what
are
you
about
there
little
man
asked
you
stupid
prying
goose
answered
the
dwarf
i
was
going
to
split
the
tree
to
get
a
little
wood
for
cooking
the
little
bit
of
food
that
one
of
us
wants
gets
burnt
up
directly
with
thick
logs
we
do
not
swallow
so
much
as
you
coarse
greedy
folk
i
had
just
driven
the
wedge
safely
in
and
everything
was
going
as
i
wished
but
the
wretched
wood
was
too
smooth
and
suddenly
sprang
asunder
and
the
tree
closed
so
quickly
that
i
could
not
pull
out
my
beautiful
white
beard
so
now
it
is
tight
in
and
i
can
not
get
away
and
you
silly
sleek
things
laugh
ugh
how
odious
you
are
the
children
tried
very
hard
but
they
could
not
pull
the
beard
out
it
was
caught
too
fast
i
will
run
and
fetch
some
one
said
you
senseless
goose
snarled
the
dwarf
why
should
you
fetch
some
one
you
are
already
two
too
many
for
me
can
you
not
think
of
something
better
don
t
be
impatient
said
i
will
help
you
and
she
pulled
her
scissors
out
of
her
pocket
and
cut
off
the
end
of
the
beard
as
soon
as
the
dwarf
felt
himself
free
he
grabbed
a
bag
which
lay
amongst
the
roots
of
the
tree
and
which
was
full
of
gold
and
lifted
it
up
grumbling
to
himself
rude
people
to
cut
off
a
piece
of
my
fine
beard
bad
luck
to
you
and
then
he
swung
the
bag
upon
his
back
and
went
off
without
even
once
looking
at
the
children
some
time
after
that
and
went
to
catch
a
dish
of
fish
as
they
came
near
the
brook
they
saw
something
like
a
large
grasshopper
jumping
toward
the
water
as
if
it
were
going
to
leap
in
they
ran
to
it
and
found
it
was
the
dwarf
where
are
you
going
said
you
surely
don
t
want
to
go
into
the
water
illustration
don
t
be
impatient
said
i
will
help
you
i
am
not
such
a
fool
cried
the
dwarf
don
t
you
see
that
the
accursed
fish
wants
to
pull
me
in
the
little
man
had
been
sitting
there
fishing
and
unluckily
the
wind
had
twisted
his
beard
with
the
just
then
a
big
fish
bit
and
the
feeble
creature
had
not
strength
to
pull
it
out
the
fish
kept
the
upper
hand
and
was
pulling
the
dwarf
toward
him
he
held
on
to
all
the
reeds
and
rushes
but
it
was
of
little
good
he
was
forced
to
follow
the
fish
and
was
in
great
danger
of
being
dragged
into
the
water
the
girls
came
just
in
time
they
held
him
fast
and
tried
to
free
his
beard
from
the
line
but
all
in
vain
beard
and
line
were
entangled
fast
together
nothing
was
left
but
to
bring
out
the
scissors
and
cut
the
beard
whereby
a
small
part
of
it
was
lost
when
the
dwarf
saw
that
he
screamed
out
is
that
civil
you
toadstool
to
disfigure
one
s
face
was
it
not
enough
to
clip
off
the
end
of
my
beard
now
you
have
cut
off
the
best
part
of
it
i
can
not
let
myself
be
seen
by
my
people
i
wish
you
had
been
made
to
run
the
soles
off
your
shoes
then
he
took
out
a
sack
of
pearls
which
lay
in
the
rushes
and
without
saying
a
word
more
he
dragged
it
away
and
disappeared
behind
a
stone
it
happened
that
soon
afterward
the
mother
sent
the
two
children
to
the
town
to
buy
needles
and
thread
and
laces
and
ribbons
the
road
led
them
across
a
heath
upon
which
huge
pieces
of
rock
lay
strewn
about
they
now
noticed
a
large
bird
hovering
in
the
air
flying
slowly
round
and
round
above
them
it
sank
lower
and
lower
and
at
last
settled
near
a
rock
not
far
off
directly
afterward
they
heard
a
loud
piteous
cry
they
ran
up
and
saw
with
horror
that
the
eagle
had
seized
their
old
acquaintance
the
dwarf
and
was
going
to
carry
him
off
the
children
full
of
pity
at
once
took
tight
hold
of
the
little
man
and
pulled
against
the
eagle
so
long
that
at
last
he
let
his
booty
go
as
soon
as
the
dwarf
had
recovered
from
his
first
fright
he
cried
with
his
shrill
voice
could
you
not
have
done
it
more
carefully
you
dragged
at
my
brown
coat
so
that
it
is
all
torn
and
full
of
holes
you
helpless
clumsy
creatures
then
he
took
up
a
sack
full
of
precious
stones
and
slipped
away
again
under
the
rock
into
his
hole
the
girls
who
by
this
time
were
used
to
his
thanklessness
went
on
their
way
and
did
their
business
in
the
town
as
they
crossed
the
heath
again
on
their
way
home
they
surprised
the
dwarf
who
had
emptied
out
his
bag
of
precious
stones
in
a
clean
spot
and
had
not
thought
that
any
one
would
come
there
at
such
a
late
hour
the
evening
sun
shone
upon
the
brilliant
stones
they
glittered
and
sparkled
with
all
colors
so
beautifully
that
the
children
stood
still
and
looked
at
them
why
do
you
stand
gaping
there
cried
the
dwarf
and
his
face
became
with
rage
he
was
going
on
with
his
bad
words
when
a
loud
growling
was
heard
and
a
black
bear
came
trotting
toward
them
out
of
the
forest
the
dwarf
sprang
up
in
a
fright
but
he
could
not
get
to
his
cave
for
the
bear
was
already
close
then
in
the
fear
of
his
heart
he
cried
dear
bear
spare
me
i
will
give
you
all
my
treasures
look
the
beautiful
jewels
lying
there
grant
me
my
life
what
do
you
want
with
such
a
slender
little
fellow
as
i
you
would
not
feel
me
between
your
teeth
come
take
these
two
wicked
girls
they
are
tender
morsels
for
you
fat
as
young
quails
for
mercy
s
sake
eat
them
the
bear
took
no
heed
of
his
words
but
gave
the
wicked
creature
a
single
blow
with
his
paw
and
he
did
not
move
again
the
girls
had
run
away
but
the
bear
called
to
them
and
do
not
be
afraid
wait
i
will
come
with
then
they
knew
his
voice
and
waited
and
when
he
came
up
to
them
suddenly
his
fell
off
and
he
stood
there
a
handsome
man
clothed
all
in
gold
i
am
a
king
s
son
he
said
and
i
was
bewitched
by
that
wicked
dwarf
who
had
stolen
my
treasures
i
have
had
to
run
about
the
forest
as
a
savage
bear
until
i
was
freed
by
his
death
now
he
has
got
his
was
married
to
him
and
to
his
brother
they
divided
between
them
the
great
treasure
which
the
dwarf
had
gathered
together
in
his
cave
the
old
mother
lived
peacefully
and
happily
with
her
children
for
many
years
she
took
the
two
with
her
and
they
stood
before
her
window
and
every
year
bore
the
most
beautiful
roses
white
and
red
illustration
the
in
former
days
every
sound
had
its
meaning
the
birds
also
had
their
own
language
which
every
one
understood
now
it
only
sounds
like
chirping
screeching
and
whistling
and
to
some
like
music
without
words
it
came
into
the
birds
mind
however
that
they
would
no
longer
be
without
a
ruler
and
would
choose
one
of
themselves
to
be
king
one
alone
amongst
them
the
green
plover
was
opposed
to
this
he
had
lived
free
and
would
die
free
and
anxiously
flying
hither
and
thither
he
cried
where
shall
i
go
where
shall
i
go
he
retired
into
a
lonely
and
unfrequented
marsh
and
showed
himself
no
more
among
his
fellows
the
birds
now
wished
to
discuss
the
matter
and
on
a
fine
may
morning
they
all
gathered
together
from
the
woods
and
fields
eagles
and
chaffinches
owls
and
crows
larks
and
sparrows
how
can
i
name
them
all
even
the
cuckoo
came
and
the
hoopoe
his
clerk
who
is
so
called
because
he
is
always
heard
a
few
days
before
him
and
a
very
small
bird
which
as
yet
had
no
name
mingled
with
the
band
the
hen
which
by
some
accident
had
heard
nothing
of
the
whole
matter
was
astonished
at
the
great
assemblage
what
what
what
is
going
to
be
done
she
cackled
but
the
cock
calmed
his
beloved
hen
and
said
only
rich
people
and
told
her
what
they
had
on
hand
it
was
decided
however
that
the
one
who
could
fly
the
highest
should
be
king
a
which
was
sitting
among
the
bushes
when
he
heard
that
cried
a
warning
no
no
no
no
because
he
thought
that
many
tears
would
be
shed
because
of
this
but
the
crow
said
caw
caw
and
that
all
would
pass
off
peaceably
it
was
now
determined
that
on
this
fine
morning
they
should
at
once
begin
to
ascend
so
that
hereafter
no
one
should
be
able
to
say
i
could
easily
have
flown
much
higher
but
the
evening
came
on
and
i
could
do
no
on
a
given
signal
therefore
the
whole
troop
rose
up
in
the
air
the
dust
ascended
from
the
land
and
there
was
tremendous
fluttering
and
whirring
and
beating
of
wings
it
looked
as
if
a
black
cloud
was
rising
up
the
little
birds
were
however
soon
left
behind
they
could
go
no
farther
and
fell
back
to
the
ground
the
larger
birds
held
out
longer
but
none
could
equal
the
eagle
who
mounted
so
high
that
he
could
have
picked
the
eyes
out
of
the
sun
and
when
he
saw
that
the
others
could
not
get
up
to
him
he
thought
why
should
i
fly
any
higher
i
am
the
king
and
began
to
let
himself
down
again
the
birds
beneath
him
at
once
cried
to
him
you
must
be
our
king
no
one
has
flown
so
high
as
except
me
screamed
the
little
fellow
without
a
name
who
had
crept
into
the
of
the
eagle
and
as
he
was
not
at
all
tired
he
rose
up
and
mounted
so
high
that
he
reached
heaven
itself
when
however
he
had
gone
as
far
as
this
he
folded
his
wings
together
and
called
down
with
clear
and
penetrating
voice
am
king
i
am
king
you
our
king
cried
the
birds
angrily
you
have
done
this
by
trick
and
cunning
so
they
made
another
condition
he
should
be
king
who
could
go
down
lowest
in
the
ground
how
the
goose
did
flap
about
with
its
broad
breast
when
it
was
once
more
on
the
land
how
quickly
the
cock
scratched
a
hole
the
duck
came
off
the
worst
of
all
for
she
leapt
into
a
ditch
but
sprained
her
legs
and
waddled
away
to
a
neighboring
pond
crying
cheating
cheating
the
little
bird
without
a
name
however
sought
out
a
slipped
down
into
it
and
cried
out
of
it
with
his
small
voice
am
king
i
am
king
you
our
king
cried
the
birds
still
more
angrily
do
you
think
your
cunning
shall
prevail
they
determined
to
keep
him
a
prisoner
in
the
hole
and
starve
him
out
the
owl
was
placed
as
sentinel
in
front
of
it
and
was
not
to
let
the
rascal
out
if
she
had
any
value
for
her
life
when
evening
was
come
all
the
birds
were
feeling
very
tired
after
exerting
their
wings
so
much
that
they
went
to
bed
with
their
wives
and
children
the
owl
alone
remained
standing
by
the
gazing
steadfastly
into
it
with
her
great
eyes
in
the
meantime
she
too
had
grown
tired
and
thought
to
herself
you
might
certainly
shut
one
eye
you
will
still
watch
with
the
other
and
the
little
miscreant
shall
not
come
out
of
his
so
she
shut
one
eye
and
with
the
other
looked
straight
at
the
the
little
fellow
put
his
head
out
and
peeped
and
wanted
to
slip
away
but
the
owl
came
forward
and
he
drew
his
head
back
then
the
owl
opened
the
one
eye
again
and
shut
the
other
intending
to
shut
them
in
turn
all
through
the
night
but
when
she
next
shut
the
one
eye
she
forgot
to
open
the
other
and
as
soon
as
both
her
eyes
were
shut
she
fell
asleep
the
little
fellow
soon
saw
that
and
slipped
away
from
that
day
forth
the
owl
has
never
dared
to
show
herself
by
daylight
for
if
she
does
the
other
birds
chase
her
and
pluck
her
feathers
out
she
only
flies
out
by
night
but
hates
and
pursues
mice
because
they
make
such
ugly
holes
the
little
bird
too
is
very
unwilling
to
let
himself
be
seen
because
he
is
afraid
it
will
cost
him
his
life
if
he
is
caught
he
steals
about
in
the
hedges
and
when
he
is
quite
safe
he
sometimes
cries
i
am
king
and
for
this
reason
the
other
birds
call
him
in
mockery
no
one
however
was
so
happy
as
the
lark
at
not
having
to
obey
the
little
king
as
soon
as
the
sun
appears
she
ascends
high
in
the
air
and
cries
ah
how
beautiful
that
is
beautiful
that
is
beautiful
beautiful
ah
how
beautiful
that
is
illustration
and
there
was
once
a
woman
who
had
three
daughters
the
eldest
of
whom
was
called
because
she
had
only
one
eye
in
the
middle
of
her
forehead
and
the
second
because
she
had
two
eyes
like
other
folks
and
the
youngest
because
she
had
three
eyes
and
her
third
eye
was
in
the
centre
of
her
forehead
now
as
saw
just
as
other
human
beings
did
her
sisters
and
her
mother
could
not
endure
her
they
said
to
her
you
with
your
two
eyes
are
no
better
than
common
folk
you
do
not
belong
to
us
they
pushed
her
about
and
threw
old
clothes
to
her
and
gave
her
nothing
to
eat
but
what
they
left
and
did
everything
that
they
could
to
make
her
unhappy
it
came
to
pass
that
had
to
go
out
into
the
fields
and
tend
the
goat
but
she
was
still
very
hungry
because
her
sisters
had
given
her
so
little
to
eat
she
sat
down
on
a
ridge
and
began
to
weep
and
so
bitterly
that
two
streams
ran
down
from
her
eyes
and
one
day
when
she
looked
up
in
her
grief
a
woman
was
standing
beside
her
who
said
why
are
you
weeping
little
answered
have
i
not
reason
to
weep
when
i
have
two
eyes
like
other
people
and
my
sisters
and
mother
hate
me
for
it
and
push
me
from
one
corner
to
another
throw
old
clothes
at
me
and
give
me
nothing
to
eat
but
the
scraps
they
leave
they
have
given
me
so
little
that
i
am
still
very
then
the
wise
woman
said
wipe
away
your
tears
and
i
will
tell
you
something
to
stop
your
ever
suffering
from
hunger
again
just
say
to
your
goat
bleat
my
little
goat
bleat
cover
the
table
with
something
to
eat
and
then
a
clean
little
table
will
stand
before
you
with
the
most
delicious
food
upon
it
of
which
you
may
eat
as
much
as
you
are
inclined
and
when
you
have
had
enough
and
have
no
more
need
of
the
little
table
just
say
bleat
my
little
goat
i
pray
and
take
the
table
quite
away
and
then
it
will
vanish
again
from
your
hereupon
the
wise
woman
departed
but
thought
i
must
instantly
make
a
trial
and
see
if
what
she
said
is
true
for
i
am
far
too
hungry
and
she
said
bleat
my
little
goat
bleat
cover
the
table
with
something
to
eat
and
scarcely
had
she
spoken
the
words
than
a
little
table
covered
with
a
white
cloth
was
standing
there
and
on
it
was
a
plate
with
a
knife
and
fork
and
a
silver
spoon
and
the
most
delicious
food
was
there
also
warm
and
smoking
as
if
it
had
just
come
out
of
the
kitchen
then
said
a
little
prayer
she
knew
lord
god
be
with
us
always
amen
and
helped
herself
to
some
food
and
enjoyed
it
and
when
she
was
satisfied
she
said
as
the
wise
woman
had
taught
her
bleat
my
little
goat
i
pray
and
take
the
table
quite
away
and
immediately
the
little
table
and
everything
on
it
was
gone
again
that
is
a
delightful
way
of
keeping
house
thought
and
was
quite
glad
and
happy
in
the
evening
when
she
went
home
with
her
goat
she
found
a
small
earthenware
dish
with
some
food
which
her
sisters
had
set
ready
for
her
but
she
did
not
touch
it
next
day
she
again
went
out
with
her
goat
and
left
the
few
bits
of
broken
bread
which
had
been
handed
to
her
lying
untouched
the
first
and
second
time
that
she
did
this
her
sisters
did
not
notice
it
but
as
it
happened
every
time
they
did
observe
it
and
said
there
is
something
wrong
about
she
always
leaves
her
food
untasted
she
used
to
eat
up
everything
that
was
given
her
she
must
have
discovered
other
ways
of
getting
in
order
that
they
might
learn
the
truth
they
resolved
to
send
with
when
she
went
to
drive
her
goat
to
the
pasture
to
watch
what
did
while
she
was
there
and
whether
any
one
brought
her
things
to
eat
and
drink
so
when
set
out
the
next
time
went
to
her
and
said
i
will
go
with
you
to
the
pasture
and
see
that
the
goat
is
well
taken
care
of
and
driven
where
there
is
but
knew
what
was
in
s
mind
and
drove
the
goat
into
high
grass
and
said
come
we
will
sit
down
and
i
will
sing
something
to
sat
down
and
was
tired
with
the
unaccustomed
walk
and
the
heat
of
the
sun
and
sang
constantly
wakest
thou
sleepest
thou
until
shut
her
one
eye
and
fell
asleep
as
soon
as
saw
that
was
fast
asleep
and
could
discover
nothing
she
said
bleat
my
little
goat
bleat
cover
the
table
with
something
to
eat
and
seated
herself
at
her
table
and
ate
and
drank
until
she
was
satisfied
then
she
again
cried
bleat
my
little
goat
i
pray
and
take
the
table
quite
away
and
in
an
instant
all
was
gone
now
awakened
and
said
you
want
to
take
care
of
the
goat
and
yet
go
to
sleep
while
you
are
doing
it
in
the
meantime
the
goat
might
run
all
over
the
world
come
let
us
go
home
so
they
went
home
and
again
let
her
little
dish
stand
untouched
and
could
not
tell
her
mother
why
she
would
not
eat
it
and
to
excuse
herself
said
i
fell
asleep
when
i
was
next
day
the
mother
said
to
this
time
you
shall
go
and
watch
if
eats
anything
when
she
is
out
and
if
any
one
fetches
her
food
and
drink
for
she
must
eat
and
drink
in
so
went
to
and
said
i
will
go
with
you
and
see
if
the
goat
is
taken
proper
care
of
and
driven
where
there
is
but
knew
what
was
in
mind
and
drove
the
goat
into
high
grass
and
said
we
will
sit
down
and
i
will
sing
something
to
you
sat
down
and
was
tired
with
the
walk
and
with
the
heat
of
the
sun
and
began
the
same
song
as
before
and
sang
are
you
waking
but
then
instead
of
singing
are
you
sleeping
as
she
ought
to
have
done
she
thoughtlessly
sang
are
you
sleeping
and
sang
all
the
time
are
you
waking
are
you
sleeping
then
two
of
the
eyes
which
had
shut
and
fell
asleep
but
the
third
as
it
had
not
been
named
in
the
song
did
not
sleep
it
is
true
that
shut
it
but
only
in
her
cunning
to
pretend
it
was
asleep
too
but
it
blinked
and
could
see
everything
very
well
and
when
thought
that
was
fast
asleep
she
used
her
little
charm
bleat
my
little
goat
bleat
cover
the
table
with
something
to
eat
and
ate
and
drank
as
much
as
her
heart
desired
and
then
ordered
the
table
to
go
away
again
bleat
my
little
goat
i
pray
and
take
the
table
quite
away
and
had
seen
everything
then
came
to
her
waked
her
and
said
have
you
been
asleep
you
are
a
good
caretaker
come
we
will
go
and
when
they
got
home
again
did
not
eat
and
said
to
the
mother
now
i
know
why
that
proud
thing
there
does
not
eat
when
she
is
out
she
says
to
the
goat
bleat
my
little
goat
bleat
cover
the
table
with
something
to
eat
and
then
a
little
table
appears
before
her
covered
with
the
best
of
food
much
better
than
any
we
have
here
when
she
has
eaten
all
she
wants
she
says
bleat
my
little
goat
i
pray
and
take
the
table
quite
away
and
all
disappears
i
watched
everything
closely
she
put
two
of
my
eyes
to
sleep
by
using
a
charm
but
luckily
the
one
in
my
forehead
kept
then
the
envious
mother
cried
do
you
want
to
fare
better
than
we
do
the
desire
shall
pass
away
and
she
fetched
a
butcher
s
knife
and
thrust
it
into
the
heart
of
the
goat
which
fell
down
dead
when
saw
that
full
of
sorrow
she
went
outside
and
seated
herself
on
the
ridge
of
grass
at
the
edge
of
the
field
and
wept
bitter
tears
suddenly
the
wise
woman
once
more
stood
by
her
side
and
said
why
are
you
weeping
have
i
not
reason
to
weep
she
answered
the
goat
which
covered
the
table
for
me
every
day
when
i
spoke
your
charm
has
been
killed
by
my
mother
and
now
i
shall
again
have
to
bear
hunger
and
the
wise
woman
said
i
will
give
you
a
piece
of
good
advice
ask
your
sisters
to
give
you
the
entrails
of
the
slaughtered
goat
and
bury
them
in
the
ground
in
front
of
the
house
and
your
fortune
will
be
then
she
vanished
and
went
home
and
said
to
her
sisters
dear
sisters
do
give
me
some
part
of
my
goat
i
don
t
wish
for
what
is
good
but
give
me
the
then
they
laughed
and
said
if
that
s
all
you
want
you
may
have
so
took
the
entrails
and
buried
them
quietly
at
evening
in
front
of
the
as
the
wise
woman
had
counseled
her
to
do
next
morning
when
they
all
awoke
and
went
to
the
there
stood
a
wonderful
magnificent
tree
with
leaves
of
silver
and
fruit
of
gold
hanging
among
them
so
that
in
all
the
wide
world
there
was
nothing
more
beautiful
or
precious
they
did
not
know
how
the
tree
could
have
come
there
during
the
night
but
saw
that
it
had
grown
up
out
of
the
entrails
of
the
goat
for
it
was
standing
on
the
exact
spot
where
she
had
buried
them
then
the
mother
said
to
climb
up
my
child
and
gather
some
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
for
climbed
up
but
when
she
was
about
to
lay
hold
of
one
of
the
golden
apples
the
branch
escaped
from
her
hands
and
that
happened
each
time
so
that
she
could
not
pluck
a
single
apple
let
her
do
what
she
might
then
said
the
mother
do
you
climb
up
you
with
your
three
eyes
can
look
about
you
better
than
slipped
down
and
climbed
up
was
not
more
skillful
and
might
search
as
she
liked
but
the
golden
apples
always
escaped
her
at
length
the
mother
grew
impatient
and
climbed
up
herself
but
could
grasp
the
fruit
no
better
than
and
for
she
always
clutched
empty
air
then
said
i
will
go
up
perhaps
i
may
succeed
the
sisters
cried
you
indeed
with
your
two
eyes
what
can
you
do
but
climbed
up
and
the
golden
apples
did
not
get
out
of
her
way
but
came
into
her
hand
of
their
own
accord
so
that
she
could
pluck
them
one
after
the
other
and
she
brought
a
whole
apronful
down
with
her
the
mother
took
them
away
from
her
and
instead
of
treating
poor
any
better
for
this
she
and
and
were
only
envious
because
alone
had
been
able
to
get
the
fruit
they
treated
her
still
more
cruelly
it
so
befell
that
once
when
they
were
all
standing
together
by
the
tree
a
young
knight
came
up
quick
cried
the
two
sisters
creep
under
this
and
don
t
disgrace
us
and
with
all
speed
they
turned
an
empty
barrel
which
was
standing
close
by
the
tree
over
poor
and
they
pushed
the
golden
apples
which
she
had
been
gathering
under
it
too
when
the
knight
came
nearer
he
was
a
handsome
lord
who
stopped
and
admired
the
magnificent
gold
and
silver
tree
and
said
to
the
two
sisters
to
whom
does
this
fine
tree
belong
any
one
who
will
bestow
one
branch
of
it
on
me
may
in
return
for
it
ask
whatsoever
he
then
and
replied
that
the
tree
belonged
to
them
and
that
they
would
give
him
a
branch
they
both
tried
very
hard
but
they
were
not
able
to
do
it
for
every
time
the
branches
and
fruit
moved
away
from
them
then
said
the
knight
it
is
very
strange
that
the
tree
should
belong
to
you
and
yet
you
should
still
not
be
able
to
break
a
piece
they
again
insisted
that
the
tree
was
their
property
whilst
they
were
saying
so
rolled
a
couple
of
golden
apples
from
under
the
barrel
to
the
feet
of
the
knight
for
she
was
vexed
with
and
for
not
speaking
the
truth
when
the
knight
saw
the
apples
he
was
astonished
and
asked
from
whence
they
came
and
answered
that
they
had
another
sister
who
was
not
allowed
to
show
herself
for
she
had
only
two
eyes
like
any
common
person
the
knight
however
desired
to
see
her
and
cried
come
hither
then
quite
cheered
came
from
beneath
the
barrel
and
the
knight
was
surprised
at
her
great
beauty
and
said
you
can
certainly
break
off
a
branch
from
the
tree
for
yes
replied
that
i
certainly
shall
be
able
to
do
for
the
tree
belongs
to
and
she
climbed
up
and
with
the
greatest
ease
broke
off
a
branch
with
beautiful
silver
leaves
and
golden
fruit
and
gave
it
to
the
knight
then
said
the
knight
what
shall
i
give
you
for
it
alas
answered
i
suffer
from
hunger
and
thirst
grief
and
want
from
early
morning
till
late
night
if
you
would
take
me
with
you
and
deliver
me
from
these
things
i
should
be
so
the
knight
lifted
on
his
horse
and
took
her
home
with
him
to
his
father
s
castle
there
he
gave
her
beautiful
clothes
and
meat
and
drink
to
her
heart
s
content
and
as
he
loved
her
so
much
he
married
her
and
the
wedding
was
solemnized
with
great
rejoicing
when
was
thus
carried
away
by
the
handsome
knight
her
two
sisters
grudged
her
good
fortune
in
downright
earnest
the
wonderful
tree
however
remains
with
us
thought
they
and
even
if
we
can
gather
no
fruit
from
it
every
one
will
stand
still
and
look
at
it
and
come
to
us
and
admire
it
who
knows
what
good
things
may
be
in
store
for
us
but
next
morning
the
tree
had
vanished
and
all
their
hopes
were
at
an
end
and
when
looked
out
of
the
window
of
her
own
little
room
to
her
great
delight
it
was
standing
in
front
of
it
and
so
it
had
followed
her
lived
a
long
time
in
happiness
one
day
two
poor
women
came
to
her
castle
and
begged
for
alms
she
looked
in
their
faces
and
recognized
her
sisters
and
who
had
fallen
into
such
poverty
that
they
had
to
wander
about
and
beg
their
bread
from
door
to
door
made
them
welcome
and
was
kind
to
them
and
took
care
of
them
so
that
they
both
with
all
their
hearts
repented
of
the
evil
that
they
had
done
in
their
youth
to
their
sister
illustration
the
at
the
well
old
there
was
once
upon
a
time
a
very
old
woman
who
lived
with
her
flock
of
geese
in
a
waste
place
among
the
mountains
and
there
had
a
little
house
the
waste
was
surrounded
by
a
large
forest
and
every
morning
the
old
woman
took
her
crutch
and
hobbled
into
it
there
however
the
dame
was
quite
active
more
so
than
any
one
would
have
thought
considering
her
age
and
collected
grass
for
her
geese
picked
all
the
wild
fruit
she
could
reach
and
carried
everything
home
on
her
back
any
one
would
have
thought
that
the
heavy
load
would
have
weighed
her
to
the
ground
but
she
always
brought
it
safely
home
if
any
one
met
her
she
greeted
him
quite
courteously
good
day
dear
countryman
it
is
a
fine
day
ah
you
wonder
that
i
should
drag
grass
about
but
every
one
must
take
his
burthen
on
his
nevertheless
people
did
not
like
to
meet
her
if
they
could
help
it
and
took
by
preference
a
roundabout
way
and
when
a
father
with
his
boys
passed
her
he
whispered
to
them
beware
of
the
old
woman
she
has
claws
beneath
her
gloves
she
is
a
one
morning
a
handsome
young
man
was
going
through
the
forest
the
sun
shone
bright
the
birds
sang
a
cool
breeze
crept
through
the
leaves
and
he
was
full
of
joy
and
gladness
he
had
as
yet
met
no
one
when
he
suddenly
perceived
the
old
witch
kneeling
on
the
ground
cutting
grass
with
a
sickle
she
had
already
thrust
a
whole
load
into
her
cloth
and
near
it
stood
two
baskets
which
were
filled
with
wild
apples
and
pears
but
good
little
mother
said
he
how
can
you
carry
all
that
away
i
must
carry
it
dear
sir
answered
she
rich
folk
s
children
have
no
need
to
do
such
things
but
with
the
peasant
folk
the
saying
goes
don
t
look
behind
you
you
will
only
see
how
crooked
your
back
is
will
you
help
me
she
said
as
he
remained
standing
by
her
you
have
still
a
straight
back
and
young
legs
it
would
be
a
trifle
to
you
besides
my
house
is
not
so
very
far
from
here
it
stands
there
on
the
heath
behind
the
hill
how
soon
you
would
bound
up
thither
the
young
man
took
compassion
on
the
old
woman
my
father
is
certainly
no
peasant
replied
he
but
a
rich
count
nevertheless
that
you
may
see
it
is
not
only
peasants
who
can
carry
things
i
will
take
your
if
you
will
try
it
said
she
i
shall
be
very
glad
you
will
certainly
have
to
walk
for
an
hour
but
what
will
that
signify
to
you
only
you
must
carry
the
apples
and
pears
as
it
now
seemed
to
the
young
man
just
a
little
serious
when
he
heard
of
an
hour
s
walk
but
the
old
woman
would
not
let
him
off
packed
the
bundle
on
his
back
and
hung
the
two
baskets
on
his
arm
see
it
is
quite
light
said
she
no
it
is
not
light
answered
the
count
and
pulled
a
rueful
face
verily
the
bundle
weighs
as
heavily
as
if
it
were
full
of
cobblestones
and
the
apples
and
pears
are
as
heavy
as
lead
i
can
scarcely
he
had
a
mind
to
put
everything
down
again
but
the
old
woman
would
not
allow
it
just
look
said
she
mockingly
the
young
gentleman
will
not
carry
what
i
an
old
woman
have
so
often
dragged
along
you
are
ready
with
fine
words
but
when
it
comes
to
being
in
earnest
you
want
to
take
to
your
heels
why
are
you
standing
loitering
there
she
continued
step
out
no
one
will
take
the
bundle
off
as
long
as
he
walked
on
level
ground
it
was
still
bearable
but
when
they
came
to
the
hill
and
had
to
climb
and
the
stones
rolled
down
under
his
feet
as
if
they
were
alive
it
was
beyond
his
strength
the
drops
of
perspiration
stood
on
his
forehead
and
ran
hot
and
cold
down
his
back
dame
said
he
i
can
go
no
farther
i
want
to
rest
a
not
here
answered
the
old
woman
when
we
have
arrived
at
our
journey
s
end
you
can
rest
but
now
you
must
go
forward
who
knows
what
good
it
may
do
you
old
woman
you
are
shameless
said
the
count
and
tried
to
throw
off
the
bundle
but
he
labored
in
vain
it
stuck
as
fast
to
his
back
as
if
it
grew
there
he
turned
and
twisted
but
he
could
not
get
rid
of
it
the
old
woman
laughed
at
this
and
sprang
about
quite
delighted
on
her
crutch
don
t
get
angry
dear
sir
said
she
you
are
growing
as
red
in
the
face
as
a
carry
your
bundle
patiently
i
will
give
you
a
good
present
when
we
get
what
could
he
do
he
was
obliged
to
submit
to
his
fate
and
crawl
along
patiently
behind
the
old
woman
she
seemed
to
grow
more
and
more
nimble
and
his
burden
still
heavier
all
at
once
she
made
a
spring
jumped
on
to
the
bundle
and
seated
herself
on
the
top
of
it
and
however
withered
she
might
be
she
was
yet
heavier
than
the
stoutest
country
lass
the
youth
s
knees
trembled
but
when
he
did
not
go
on
the
old
woman
hit
him
about
the
legs
with
a
switch
and
with
groaning
continually
he
climbed
the
mountain
and
at
length
reached
the
old
woman
s
house
when
he
was
just
about
to
drop
when
the
geese
perceived
the
old
woman
they
flapped
their
wings
stretched
out
their
necks
ran
to
meet
her
cackling
all
the
while
behind
the
flock
walked
stick
in
hand
an
old
wench
strong
and
big
but
ugly
as
night
good
mother
said
she
to
the
old
woman
has
anything
happened
to
you
you
have
stayed
away
so
long
by
no
means
my
dear
daughter
answered
she
i
have
met
with
nothing
bad
but
on
the
contrary
with
this
kind
gentleman
who
has
carried
my
burthen
for
me
only
think
he
even
took
me
on
his
back
when
i
was
tired
the
way
too
has
not
seemed
long
to
us
we
have
been
merry
and
have
been
cracking
jokes
with
each
other
all
the
at
last
the
old
woman
slid
down
took
the
bundle
off
the
young
man
s
back
and
the
baskets
from
his
arm
looked
at
him
quite
kindly
and
said
now
seat
yourself
on
the
bench
before
the
door
and
rest
you
have
fairly
earned
your
wages
and
they
shall
not
be
then
she
said
to
the
go
into
the
house
my
little
daughter
it
is
not
becoming
for
you
to
be
alone
with
a
young
gentleman
one
must
not
pour
oil
on
to
the
fire
he
might
fall
in
love
with
the
count
knew
not
whether
to
laugh
or
to
cry
such
a
sweetheart
as
that
thought
he
could
not
touch
my
heart
even
if
she
were
thirty
years
in
the
meantime
the
old
woman
stroked
and
fondled
her
geese
as
if
they
were
children
and
then
went
into
the
house
with
her
daughter
the
youth
lay
down
on
the
bench
under
a
wild
the
air
was
warm
and
mild
on
all
sides
stretched
a
green
meadow
which
was
set
with
cowslips
wild
thyme
and
a
thousand
other
flowers
through
the
midst
of
it
rippled
a
clear
brook
on
which
the
sun
sparkled
and
the
white
geese
went
walking
backward
and
forward
or
paddled
in
the
water
it
is
quite
delightful
here
said
he
but
i
am
so
tired
that
i
can
not
keep
my
eyes
open
i
will
sleep
a
little
if
only
a
gust
of
wind
does
not
come
and
blow
my
legs
off
my
body
for
they
are
as
brittle
as
when
he
had
slept
a
little
while
the
old
woman
came
and
shook
him
till
he
awoke
sit
up
said
she
you
can
not
stay
here
i
have
certainly
treated
you
badly
still
it
has
not
cost
you
your
life
of
money
and
land
you
have
no
need
here
is
something
else
for
thereupon
she
thrust
a
little
book
into
his
hand
which
was
cut
out
of
a
single
emerald
take
great
care
of
it
said
she
it
will
bring
you
good
the
count
sprang
up
and
as
he
felt
that
he
was
quite
fresh
and
had
recovered
his
vigor
he
thanked
the
old
woman
for
her
present
and
set
off
without
even
once
looking
back
at
the
beautiful
daughter
when
he
was
already
some
way
off
he
still
heard
in
the
distance
the
noisy
cry
of
the
geese
for
three
days
the
count
had
to
wander
in
the
wilderness
before
he
could
find
his
way
out
he
then
reached
a
large
town
as
no
one
knew
him
he
was
led
into
the
royal
palace
where
the
king
and
queen
were
sitting
on
their
throne
the
count
fell
on
one
knee
drew
the
emerald
book
out
of
his
pocket
and
laid
it
at
the
queen
s
feet
she
bade
him
rise
and
hand
her
the
little
book
hardly
however
had
she
opened
it
and
looked
therein
than
she
fell
as
if
dead
to
the
ground
the
count
was
seized
by
the
king
s
servants
and
was
being
led
to
prison
when
the
queen
opened
her
eyes
and
ordered
them
to
release
him
and
every
one
was
to
go
out
as
she
wished
to
speak
with
him
in
private
when
the
queen
was
alone
she
began
to
weep
bitterly
and
said
of
what
use
to
me
are
the
splendors
and
honors
with
which
i
am
surrounded
every
morning
i
awake
in
pain
and
sorrow
i
had
three
daughters
the
youngest
of
whom
was
so
beautiful
that
the
whole
world
looked
on
her
as
a
wonder
she
was
as
white
as
snow
as
rosy
as
and
her
hair
as
radiant
as
sunbeams
when
she
cried
not
tears
fell
from
her
eyes
but
pearls
and
jewels
only
when
she
was
fifteen
years
old
the
king
summoned
all
three
sisters
to
come
before
his
throne
you
should
have
seen
how
all
the
people
gazed
when
the
youngest
entered
it
was
just
as
if
the
sun
were
rising
then
the
king
spoke
my
daughters
i
know
not
when
my
last
hour
may
arrive
i
will
decide
what
each
shall
receive
at
my
death
you
all
love
me
but
the
one
of
you
who
loves
me
best
shall
fare
the
each
of
them
said
she
loved
him
best
can
you
not
express
to
me
said
the
king
how
much
you
do
love
me
and
thus
i
shall
see
what
you
mean
the
eldest
spoke
i
love
my
father
as
dearly
as
the
sweetest
the
second
i
love
my
father
as
dearly
as
my
prettiest
but
the
youngest
was
silent
then
the
father
said
and
you
my
dearest
child
how
much
do
you
love
me
i
do
not
know
and
can
compare
my
love
with
but
her
father
insisted
that
she
should
name
something
so
she
said
at
last
the
best
food
does
not
please
me
without
salt
therefore
i
love
my
father
like
when
the
king
heard
that
he
fell
into
a
passion
and
said
if
you
love
me
like
salt
your
love
shall
also
be
repaid
with
then
he
divided
the
kingdom
between
the
two
elder
but
caused
a
sack
of
salt
to
be
bound
on
the
back
of
the
youngest
and
two
servants
had
to
lead
her
forth
into
the
wild
forest
we
all
begged
and
prayed
for
her
said
the
queen
but
the
king
s
anger
was
not
to
be
appeased
how
she
cried
when
she
had
to
leave
us
the
whole
road
was
strewn
with
the
pearls
which
flowed
from
her
eyes
the
king
soon
afterward
repented
of
his
great
severity
and
had
the
whole
forest
searched
for
the
poor
child
but
no
one
could
find
her
when
i
think
that
the
wild
beasts
have
devoured
her
i
know
not
how
to
contain
myself
for
sorrow
many
a
time
i
console
myself
with
the
hope
that
she
is
still
alive
and
may
have
hidden
herself
in
a
cave
or
has
found
shelter
with
compassionate
people
but
picture
to
yourself
when
i
opened
your
little
emerald
book
a
pearl
lay
therein
of
exactly
the
same
kind
as
those
which
used
to
fall
from
my
daughter
s
eyes
and
then
you
can
also
imagine
how
the
sight
of
it
stirred
my
heart
you
must
tell
me
how
you
came
by
that
the
count
told
her
that
he
had
received
it
from
the
old
woman
in
the
forest
who
had
appeared
very
strange
to
him
and
must
be
a
witch
but
he
had
neither
seen
nor
heard
anything
of
the
queen
s
child
the
king
and
the
queen
resolved
to
seek
out
the
old
woman
they
thought
that
there
where
the
pearl
had
been
they
would
obtain
news
of
their
daughter
gray
the
old
woman
was
sitting
in
that
lonely
place
at
her
spinning
it
was
already
dusk
and
a
log
which
was
burning
on
the
hearth
gave
a
scanty
light
all
at
once
there
was
a
noise
outside
the
geese
were
coming
home
from
the
pasture
and
uttering
their
hoarse
cries
soon
afterward
the
daughter
entered
but
the
old
woman
scarcely
thanked
her
and
only
shook
her
head
a
little
the
daughter
sat
down
beside
her
took
her
and
twisted
the
threads
as
nimbly
as
a
young
girl
thus
they
both
sat
for
two
hours
and
exchanged
never
a
word
illustration
when
the
gray
mask
fell
off
her
golden
hair
broke
forth
at
last
something
rustled
at
the
window
and
two
fiery
eyes
peered
in
it
was
an
old
which
cried
three
times
the
old
woman
looked
up
just
a
little
then
she
said
now
my
little
daughter
it
is
time
for
you
to
go
out
and
do
your
she
rose
and
went
out
and
where
did
she
go
over
the
meadows
ever
onward
into
the
valley
at
last
she
came
to
a
well
with
three
old
standing
beside
it
meanwhile
the
moon
had
risen
large
and
round
over
the
mountain
and
it
was
so
light
that
one
could
have
found
a
needle
she
removed
a
skin
which
covered
her
face
then
bent
down
to
the
well
and
began
to
wash
herself
when
she
had
finished
she
dipped
the
skin
also
in
the
water
and
laid
it
on
the
meadow
so
that
it
should
bleach
in
the
moonlight
and
dry
again
but
how
the
maiden
was
changed
such
a
change
as
that
was
never
seen
before
when
the
gray
mask
fell
off
her
golden
hair
broke
forth
like
sunbeams
and
spread
about
like
a
mantle
over
her
whole
form
her
eyes
shone
out
as
brightly
as
the
stars
in
heaven
and
her
cheeks
bloomed
a
soft
red
like
but
the
fair
maiden
was
sad
she
sat
down
and
wept
bitterly
one
tear
after
another
forced
itself
out
of
her
eyes
and
rolled
through
her
long
hair
to
the
ground
there
she
sat
and
would
have
remained
sitting
a
long
time
if
there
had
not
been
a
rustling
and
cracking
in
the
boughs
of
the
neighboring
tree
she
sprang
up
like
a
roe
which
has
been
overtaken
by
the
shot
of
the
hunter
just
then
the
moon
was
obscured
by
a
dark
cloud
and
in
an
instant
the
maiden
had
slipped
on
the
old
skin
and
vanished
as
does
a
light
blown
out
by
the
wind
she
ran
back
home
trembling
like
an
the
old
woman
was
standing
on
the
threshold
and
the
maiden
was
about
to
relate
what
had
befallen
her
but
the
old
woman
laughed
kindly
and
said
i
already
know
she
led
her
into
the
room
and
lighted
a
new
log
she
did
not
however
sit
down
to
her
spinning
again
but
fetched
a
broom
and
began
to
sweep
and
scour
all
must
be
clean
and
sweet
she
said
to
the
maiden
but
mother
said
the
maiden
why
do
you
begin
work
at
so
late
an
hour
what
do
you
expect
do
you
know
then
what
time
it
is
asked
the
old
woman
not
yet
midnight
answered
the
maiden
but
already
past
eleven
o
do
you
not
remember
continued
the
old
woman
that
it
is
three
years
since
you
came
to
me
your
time
is
up
we
can
no
longer
remain
the
maiden
was
terrified
and
said
alas
dear
mother
will
you
cast
me
off
where
shall
i
go
i
have
no
friends
and
no
home
to
which
i
can
go
i
have
always
done
as
you
bade
me
and
you
have
always
been
satisfied
with
me
do
not
send
me
the
old
woman
would
not
tell
the
maiden
what
lay
before
her
my
stay
here
is
over
she
said
to
her
but
when
i
depart
house
and
parlor
must
be
clean
therefore
do
not
hinder
me
in
my
work
have
no
care
for
yourself
you
shall
find
a
roof
to
shelter
you
and
the
wages
which
i
will
give
you
shall
also
content
but
tell
me
what
is
about
to
happen
the
maiden
continued
to
entreat
i
tell
you
again
do
not
hinder
me
in
my
work
do
not
say
a
word
more
go
to
your
chamber
take
the
skin
off
your
face
and
put
on
the
silken
gown
which
you
had
on
when
you
came
to
me
and
then
wait
in
your
chamber
until
i
call
but
i
must
once
more
tell
of
the
king
and
queen
who
had
journeyed
forth
with
the
count
in
order
to
seek
out
the
old
woman
in
the
wilderness
the
count
had
strayed
away
from
them
in
the
wood
by
night
and
had
to
walk
onward
alone
next
day
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
on
the
right
track
he
still
went
forward
until
darkness
came
on
then
he
climbed
a
tree
intending
to
pass
the
night
there
for
he
feared
that
he
might
lose
his
way
when
the
moon
illumined
the
surrounding
country
he
perceived
a
figure
coming
down
the
mountain
she
had
no
stick
in
her
hand
yet
he
could
see
that
it
was
the
whom
he
had
seen
before
in
the
house
of
the
old
woman
oho
cried
he
there
she
comes
and
if
i
once
get
hold
of
one
of
the
witches
the
other
shall
not
escape
me
but
how
astonished
he
was
when
she
went
to
the
well
took
off
the
skin
and
washed
herself
her
golden
hair
fell
down
all
about
her
and
she
was
more
beautiful
than
any
one
whom
he
had
ever
seen
in
the
whole
world
he
hardly
dared
to
breathe
but
stretched
his
head
as
far
forward
through
the
leaves
as
he
dared
and
stared
at
her
either
he
bent
over
too
far
or
whatever
the
cause
might
be
the
bough
suddenly
cracked
and
that
very
moment
the
maiden
slipped
into
the
skin
sprang
away
like
a
roe
and
as
the
moon
was
suddenly
covered
disappeared
from
his
eyes
hardly
had
she
disappeared
before
the
count
descended
from
the
tree
and
hastened
after
her
with
nimble
steps
he
had
not
gone
far
before
he
saw
in
the
twilight
two
figures
coming
over
the
meadow
it
was
the
king
and
queen
who
had
perceived
from
a
distance
the
light
shining
in
the
old
woman
s
little
house
and
were
going
to
it
the
count
told
them
what
wonderful
thing
he
had
seen
by
the
well
and
they
did
not
doubt
but
that
she
was
their
lost
daughter
they
walked
onward
full
of
joy
and
soon
came
to
the
little
house
the
geese
were
sitting
all
round
it
and
had
thrust
their
heads
under
their
wings
and
were
sleeping
and
not
one
of
them
moved
the
king
and
queen
looked
in
at
the
window
the
old
woman
was
sitting
there
quietly
spinning
nodding
her
head
and
never
looking
round
the
room
was
perfectly
clean
as
if
the
little
mist
men
who
carry
no
dust
on
their
feet
lived
there
their
daughter
however
they
did
not
see
they
gazed
at
all
this
for
a
long
time
at
last
they
took
heart
and
knocked
softly
at
the
window
the
old
woman
appeared
to
have
been
expecting
them
she
rose
and
called
out
quite
kindly
come
in
i
know
you
when
they
had
entered
the
room
the
old
woman
said
you
might
have
spared
yourself
the
long
walk
if
you
had
not
three
years
ago
unjustly
driven
away
your
child
who
is
so
good
and
lovable
no
harm
has
come
to
her
for
three
years
she
has
had
to
tend
the
geese
with
them
she
has
learnt
no
evil
but
has
preserved
her
purity
of
heart
you
however
have
been
sufficiently
punished
by
the
misery
in
which
you
have
then
she
went
to
the
chamber
and
called
come
out
my
little
thereupon
the
door
opened
and
the
princess
stepped
out
in
her
silken
garments
with
her
golden
hair
and
her
shining
eyes
and
it
was
as
if
an
angel
from
heaven
had
entered
she
went
up
to
her
father
and
mother
fell
on
their
necks
and
kissed
them
there
was
no
help
for
it
they
all
had
to
weep
for
joy
the
young
count
stood
near
them
and
when
she
perceived
him
she
became
as
red
in
the
face
as
a
she
herself
did
not
know
why
the
king
said
my
dear
child
i
have
given
away
my
kingdom
what
shall
i
give
thee
she
needs
nothing
said
the
old
woman
i
give
her
the
tears
that
she
has
wept
on
your
account
they
are
precious
pearls
finer
than
those
that
are
found
in
the
sea
and
worth
more
than
your
whole
kingdom
and
i
give
her
my
little
house
as
payment
for
her
when
the
old
woman
had
said
that
she
disappeared
from
their
sight
the
walls
rattled
a
little
and
when
the
king
and
queen
looked
round
the
little
house
had
changed
into
a
splendid
palace
a
royal
table
had
been
spread
and
the
servants
were
running
hither
and
thither
illustration
the
shoes
that
were
danced
to
pieces
there
was
once
upon
a
time
a
king
who
had
twelve
daughters
each
one
more
beautiful
than
the
other
they
all
slept
together
in
one
chamber
in
which
their
beds
stood
side
by
side
every
night
when
they
were
in
them
the
king
locked
the
door
and
bolted
it
but
in
the
morning
when
he
unlocked
the
door
he
saw
that
their
shoes
were
worn
out
with
dancing
and
no
one
could
find
out
how
that
had
happened
then
the
king
caused
it
to
be
proclaimed
that
whosoever
could
discover
where
they
danced
at
night
should
choose
one
of
them
for
his
wife
and
be
king
after
his
death
but
that
whosoever
came
forward
and
had
not
discovered
it
within
three
days
and
nights
should
forfeit
his
life
it
was
not
long
before
a
king
s
son
presented
himself
and
offered
to
undertake
the
enterprise
he
was
well
received
and
in
the
evening
was
led
into
a
room
adjoining
the
princesses
his
bed
was
placed
there
and
he
was
to
watch
where
they
went
and
danced
and
in
order
that
they
might
do
nothing
secretly
or
go
away
to
some
other
place
the
door
of
their
room
was
left
open
but
the
eyelids
of
the
prince
grew
heavy
as
lead
and
he
fell
asleep
when
he
awoke
in
the
morning
all
twelve
had
been
to
the
dance
for
their
shoes
were
standing
there
with
holes
in
the
soles
on
the
second
and
third
nights
it
fell
out
just
the
same
and
then
his
head
was
struck
off
without
mercy
many
others
came
after
this
and
undertook
the
enterprise
but
all
forfeited
their
lives
now
it
came
to
pass
that
a
poor
soldier
who
had
a
wound
and
could
serve
no
longer
found
himself
on
the
road
to
the
town
where
the
king
lived
there
he
met
an
old
woman
who
asked
him
where
he
was
going
i
hardly
know
myself
answered
he
and
added
in
jest
i
had
half
a
mind
to
discover
where
the
princesses
danced
their
shoes
into
holes
and
thus
become
that
is
not
so
difficult
said
the
old
woman
you
must
not
drink
the
wine
which
will
be
brought
to
you
at
with
that
she
gave
him
a
little
cloak
and
said
if
you
put
on
that
you
will
be
invisible
and
then
you
can
steal
after
the
when
the
soldier
had
received
this
good
advice
he
took
heart
went
to
the
king
and
announced
himself
as
a
suitor
he
was
as
well
received
as
the
others
and
royal
garments
were
put
upon
him
he
was
conducted
that
evening
at
bedtime
into
the
and
as
he
was
about
to
go
to
bed
the
eldest
came
and
brought
him
a
cup
of
wine
he
lay
down
but
did
not
drink
the
wine
the
twelve
princesses
in
their
chamber
laughed
and
the
eldest
said
he
too
might
as
well
have
saved
his
with
that
they
got
up
opened
wardrobes
presses
cupboards
and
brought
out
pretty
dresses
dressed
themselves
before
the
mirrors
sprang
about
and
rejoiced
at
the
prospect
of
the
dance
only
the
youngest
said
i
know
not
how
it
is
you
are
very
happy
but
i
feel
strange
some
misfortune
is
certainly
about
to
befall
you
are
a
goose
who
are
always
frightened
said
the
eldest
have
you
forgotten
how
many
king
s
sons
have
already
come
here
in
vain
i
had
hardly
any
need
to
give
the
soldier
a
in
any
case
the
clown
would
not
have
when
they
were
all
ready
the
eldest
then
went
to
her
bed
and
tapped
it
it
immediately
sank
into
the
earth
and
one
after
the
other
they
descended
through
the
opening
the
eldest
going
first
the
soldier
who
had
watched
everything
tarried
no
longer
put
on
his
little
cloak
and
went
down
last
with
the
youngest
down
the
steps
he
just
trod
a
little
on
her
dress
she
was
terrified
at
that
and
cried
out
what
is
that
who
is
pulling
at
my
dress
don
t
be
so
silly
said
the
eldest
you
have
caught
it
on
a
then
they
went
all
the
way
down
and
when
they
were
at
the
bottom
they
were
standing
in
a
wonderfully
pretty
avenue
of
trees
all
the
leaves
of
which
were
of
silver
and
shone
and
glistened
the
soldier
thought
i
must
carry
a
token
away
with
me
and
broke
off
a
twig
from
one
of
them
on
which
the
tree
cracked
with
a
loud
report
the
youngest
cried
out
again
something
is
wrong
did
you
hear
the
crack
but
the
eldest
said
it
is
a
gun
fired
for
joy
because
we
have
got
rid
of
our
prince
so
after
that
they
came
into
an
avenue
where
all
the
leaves
were
of
gold
and
lastly
into
a
third
where
they
were
of
bright
diamonds
he
broke
off
a
twig
from
each
which
made
such
a
crack
each
time
that
the
youngest
started
back
in
terror
but
the
eldest
still
declared
that
they
were
salutes
they
went
on
and
came
to
a
great
lake
whereon
stood
twelve
little
boats
and
in
every
boat
sat
a
handsome
prince
all
of
whom
were
waiting
for
the
twelve
princesses
each
took
one
of
them
with
him
but
the
soldier
seated
himself
by
the
youngest
then
her
prince
said
i
can
t
tell
why
the
boat
is
so
much
heavier
i
shall
have
to
row
with
all
my
strength
if
i
am
to
get
it
what
should
cause
that
said
the
youngest
but
the
warm
weather
i
feel
very
warm
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
lake
stood
a
splendid
castle
from
whence
resounded
the
joyous
music
of
trumpets
and
they
rowed
thither
entered
and
each
prince
danced
with
the
maiden
he
loved
but
the
soldier
danced
with
them
unseen
and
when
one
of
them
had
a
cup
of
wine
in
her
hand
he
drank
it
up
so
that
the
cup
was
empty
when
she
carried
it
to
her
mouth
the
youngest
was
alarmed
at
this
but
the
eldest
always
made
her
be
silent
they
danced
there
till
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
when
all
the
shoes
were
danced
into
holes
and
they
were
forced
to
leave
off
the
princes
rowed
them
back
again
over
the
lake
and
this
time
the
soldier
seated
himself
by
the
eldest
on
the
shore
they
took
leave
of
their
princes
and
promised
to
return
the
following
night
when
they
reached
the
stairs
the
soldier
ran
on
in
front
and
lay
down
in
his
bed
and
when
the
twelve
princesses
had
come
up
slowly
and
wearily
he
was
already
snoring
so
loudly
that
they
could
all
hear
him
and
they
said
so
far
as
he
is
concerned
we
are
they
took
off
their
beautiful
dresses
laid
them
away
put
the
shoes
under
the
bed
and
lay
down
next
morning
the
soldier
was
resolved
not
to
speak
but
to
watch
the
wonderful
goings
on
and
that
night
again
went
with
them
then
everything
was
done
just
as
it
had
been
done
the
first
time
and
they
danced
until
their
shoes
were
worn
to
pieces
but
the
third
time
he
took
a
cup
away
with
him
as
a
token
when
the
hour
had
arrived
for
him
to
give
his
answer
he
took
the
three
twigs
and
the
cup
and
went
to
the
king
but
the
twelve
princesses
stood
behind
the
door
and
listened
for
what
he
was
going
to
say
when
the
king
put
the
question
where
have
my
twelve
daughters
danced
their
shoes
to
pieces
in
the
night
he
answered
in
an
underground
castle
with
twelve
princes
and
related
how
it
had
come
to
pass
and
brought
out
the
tokens
the
king
then
summoned
his
daughters
and
asked
them
if
the
soldier
had
told
the
truth
and
when
they
saw
that
they
were
betrayed
and
that
falsehood
would
be
of
no
avail
they
were
obliged
to
confess
all
thereupon
the
king
asked
which
of
them
he
would
have
for
his
wife
he
answered
i
am
no
longer
young
so
give
me
the
then
the
wedding
was
celebrated
on
the
day
and
the
kingdom
was
promised
him
after
the
king
s
death
but
the
princes
were
bewitched
for
as
many
days
more
as
they
had
danced
nights
with
the
twelve
illustration
the
nix
of
the
there
was
once
upon
a
time
a
miller
who
lived
with
his
wife
in
great
contentment
they
had
money
and
land
and
their
prosperity
increased
year
by
year
more
and
more
but
comes
like
a
thief
in
the
night
as
their
wealth
had
increased
so
did
it
again
decrease
year
by
year
at
last
the
miller
could
hardly
call
the
mill
in
which
he
lived
his
own
he
was
in
great
distress
and
when
he
lay
down
after
his
day
s
work
found
no
rest
but
full
of
care
tossed
about
in
his
bed
one
morning
he
rose
before
daybreak
and
went
out
into
the
open
air
thinking
that
perhaps
there
his
heart
might
become
lighter
as
he
was
stepping
over
the
the
first
sunbeam
was
just
breaking
forth
and
he
heard
a
rippling
sound
in
the
pond
he
turned
round
and
perceived
a
beautiful
woman
rising
slowly
out
of
the
water
her
long
hair
which
she
was
holding
off
her
shoulders
with
her
soft
hands
fell
down
on
both
sides
and
covered
her
white
body
he
saw
that
she
was
the
nix
of
the
and
in
his
fright
did
not
know
whether
he
should
run
away
or
stay
where
he
was
but
the
nix
made
her
sweet
voice
heard
called
him
by
his
name
and
asked
him
why
he
was
so
sad
the
miller
was
at
first
struck
dumb
but
when
he
heard
her
speak
so
kindly
he
took
heart
and
told
her
how
he
had
formerly
lived
in
wealth
and
happiness
but
that
now
he
was
so
poor
that
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
be
easy
answered
the
nix
i
will
make
you
richer
and
happier
than
you
have
ever
been
before
only
you
must
promise
to
give
me
the
young
thing
which
has
just
been
born
in
your
what
else
can
that
be
thought
the
miller
but
a
young
puppy
or
kitten
and
he
promised
her
what
she
desired
the
nix
descended
into
the
water
again
and
he
hurried
back
to
his
mill
consoled
and
in
good
spirits
he
had
not
yet
reached
it
when
the
came
out
of
the
house
and
cried
to
him
to
rejoice
for
his
wife
had
a
little
boy
the
miller
stood
as
if
struck
by
lightning
he
saw
very
well
that
the
cunning
nix
had
been
aware
of
it
and
had
cheated
him
hanging
his
head
he
went
up
to
his
wife
s
bedside
and
when
she
said
why
do
you
not
rejoice
over
the
fine
boy
he
told
her
what
had
befallen
him
and
what
kind
of
a
promise
he
had
given
to
the
nix
of
what
use
to
me
are
riches
and
prosperity
he
added
if
i
am
to
lose
my
child
but
what
can
i
do
even
the
relations
who
had
come
thither
to
wish
them
joy
did
not
know
what
to
say
in
the
meantime
prosperity
again
returned
to
the
miller
s
house
all
that
he
undertook
succeeded
it
was
as
if
presses
and
coffers
filled
themselves
of
their
own
accord
and
as
if
money
multiplied
nightly
in
the
cupboards
it
was
not
long
before
his
wealth
was
greater
than
it
had
ever
been
before
but
he
could
not
rejoice
over
it
untroubled
the
bargain
which
he
had
made
with
the
nix
tormented
his
soul
whenever
he
passed
the
he
feared
she
might
ascend
and
remind
him
of
his
debt
he
never
let
the
boy
himself
go
near
the
water
beware
he
said
to
him
if
you
do
but
touch
the
water
a
hand
will
rise
seize
you
and
draw
you
but
as
year
after
year
went
by
and
the
nix
did
not
show
herself
again
the
miller
began
to
feel
at
ease
the
boy
grew
up
to
be
a
youth
and
was
apprenticed
to
a
huntsman
when
he
had
learnt
everything
and
had
become
an
excellent
huntsman
the
lord
of
the
village
took
him
into
his
service
in
the
village
lived
a
beautiful
and
maiden
who
pleased
the
huntsman
when
his
master
perceived
that
he
gave
him
a
little
house
the
two
were
married
lived
peacefully
and
happily
and
loved
each
other
with
all
their
hearts
one
day
the
huntsman
was
chasing
a
roe
and
when
the
animal
turned
aside
from
the
forest
into
the
open
country
he
pursued
it
and
at
last
shot
it
he
did
not
notice
that
he
was
now
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
dangerous
and
went
after
he
had
disembowelled
the
stag
to
the
water
in
order
to
wash
his
hands
scarcely
however
had
he
dipped
them
in
than
the
nix
ascended
smilingly
wound
her
dripping
arms
around
him
and
drew
him
quickly
down
under
the
waves
which
closed
over
him
when
it
was
evening
and
the
huntsman
did
not
return
home
his
wife
grew
alarmed
she
went
out
to
seek
him
and
as
he
had
often
told
her
that
he
had
to
be
on
his
guard
against
the
snares
of
the
nix
and
dared
not
venture
into
the
neighborhood
of
the
she
already
suspected
what
had
happened
she
hastened
to
the
water
and
when
she
found
his
lying
on
the
shore
she
could
no
longer
have
any
doubt
of
the
misfortune
lamenting
her
sorrow
and
wringing
her
hands
she
called
on
her
beloved
by
name
but
in
vain
she
hurried
across
to
the
other
side
of
the
pond
and
called
him
anew
she
reviled
the
nix
with
harsh
words
but
no
answer
followed
the
surface
of
the
water
remained
calm
only
the
crescent
moon
stared
steadily
back
at
her
the
poor
woman
did
not
leave
the
pond
with
hasty
steps
she
paced
round
and
round
it
without
resting
a
moment
sometimes
in
silence
sometimes
uttering
a
loud
cry
sometimes
softly
sobbing
at
last
her
strength
came
to
an
end
she
sank
down
to
the
ground
and
fell
into
a
heavy
sleep
presently
a
dream
took
possession
of
her
she
was
anxiously
climbing
upward
between
great
masses
of
rock
thorns
and
briars
caught
her
feet
the
rain
beat
in
her
face
and
the
wind
tossed
her
long
hair
about
when
she
had
reached
the
summit
quite
a
different
sight
presented
itself
to
her
the
sky
was
blue
the
air
soft
the
ground
sloped
gently
downward
and
on
a
green
meadow
gay
with
flowers
of
every
color
stood
a
pretty
cottage
she
went
up
to
it
and
opened
the
door
there
sat
an
old
woman
with
white
hair
who
beckoned
to
her
kindly
at
that
very
moment
the
poor
woman
awoke
day
had
already
dawned
and
she
at
once
resolved
to
act
in
accordance
with
her
dream
she
laboriously
climbed
the
mountain
everything
was
exactly
as
she
had
seen
it
in
the
night
the
old
woman
received
her
kindly
and
pointed
out
a
chair
on
which
she
might
sit
you
must
have
met
with
a
misfortune
she
said
since
you
have
sought
out
my
lonely
with
tears
the
woman
related
what
had
befallen
her
be
comforted
said
the
old
woman
i
will
help
you
here
is
a
golden
comb
for
you
tarry
till
the
full
moon
has
risen
then
go
to
the
seat
yourself
on
the
shore
and
comb
your
long
black
hair
with
this
comb
when
you
have
done
lay
it
down
on
the
bank
and
you
will
see
what
will
the
woman
returned
home
but
the
time
till
the
full
moon
came
passed
slowly
at
last
the
shining
disc
appeared
in
the
heavens
then
she
went
out
to
the
sat
down
and
combed
her
long
black
hair
with
the
golden
comb
when
she
had
finished
she
laid
it
down
at
the
water
s
edge
it
was
not
long
before
there
was
a
movement
in
the
depths
a
wave
rose
rolled
to
the
shore
and
bore
the
comb
away
with
it
in
not
more
than
the
time
necessary
for
the
comb
to
sink
to
the
bottom
the
surface
of
the
water
parted
and
the
head
of
the
huntsman
arose
he
did
not
speak
but
looked
at
his
wife
with
sorrowful
glances
at
the
same
instant
a
second
wave
came
rushing
up
and
covered
the
man
s
head
all
had
vanished
the
lay
peaceful
as
before
and
nothing
but
the
face
of
the
full
moon
shone
on
it
illustration
she
combed
her
long
black
hair
full
of
sorrow
the
woman
went
back
but
again
the
dream
showed
her
the
cottage
of
the
old
woman
next
morning
she
again
set
out
and
complained
of
her
woes
to
the
wise
woman
the
old
woman
gave
her
a
golden
flute
and
said
tarry
till
the
full
moon
comes
again
then
take
this
flute
play
a
beautiful
air
on
it
and
when
you
have
finished
lay
it
on
the
sand
then
you
will
see
what
will
the
wife
did
as
the
old
woman
told
her
no
sooner
was
the
flute
lying
on
the
sand
than
there
was
a
stirring
in
the
depths
and
a
wave
rushed
up
and
bore
the
flute
away
with
it
immediately
afterward
the
water
parted
and
not
only
the
head
of
the
man
but
half
of
his
body
also
arose
he
stretched
out
his
arms
longingly
toward
her
but
a
second
wave
came
up
covered
him
and
drew
him
down
again
alas
what
does
it
profit
me
said
the
unhappy
woman
that
i
should
see
my
beloved
only
to
lose
him
again
despair
filled
her
heart
anew
but
the
dream
led
her
a
third
time
to
the
house
of
the
old
woman
she
sat
out
and
the
wise
woman
gave
her
a
golden
consoled
her
and
said
all
is
not
yet
fulfilled
tarry
until
the
time
of
the
full
moon
then
take
the
seat
yourself
on
the
shore
and
spin
the
spool
full
when
you
have
done
that
place
the
near
the
water
and
you
will
see
what
will
the
woman
obeyed
all
she
said
exactly
as
soon
as
the
full
moon
showed
itself
she
carried
the
golden
to
the
shore
and
spun
industriously
until
the
flax
came
to
an
end
and
the
spool
was
quite
filled
with
the
threads
no
sooner
was
the
wheel
standing
on
the
shore
than
there
was
a
more
violent
movement
than
before
in
the
depths
of
the
pond
and
a
mighty
wave
rushed
up
and
bore
the
wheel
away
with
it
immediately
the
head
and
the
whole
body
of
the
man
rose
into
the
air
in
a
he
quickly
sprang
to
the
shore
caught
his
wife
by
the
hand
and
fled
but
they
had
scarcely
gone
a
very
little
distance
when
the
whole
pond
rose
with
a
frightful
roar
and
streamed
out
over
the
open
country
the
fugitives
already
saw
death
before
their
eyes
when
the
woman
in
her
terror
implored
the
help
of
the
old
woman
and
in
an
instant
they
were
transformed
she
into
a
toad
he
into
a
frog
the
flood
which
had
overtaken
them
could
not
destroy
them
but
it
tore
them
apart
and
carried
them
far
away
when
the
water
had
dispersed
and
they
both
touched
dry
land
again
they
regained
their
human
form
but
neither
knew
where
the
other
was
they
found
themselves
among
strange
people
who
did
not
know
their
native
land
high
mountains
and
deep
valleys
lay
between
them
in
order
to
keep
themselves
alive
they
were
both
obliged
to
tend
sheep
for
many
long
years
they
drove
their
flocks
through
field
and
forest
and
were
full
of
sorrow
and
longing
when
spring
had
once
more
broken
forth
on
the
earth
one
day
they
both
went
out
with
their
flocks
and
as
chance
would
have
it
they
drew
near
each
other
they
met
in
a
valley
but
did
not
recognize
each
other
yet
they
rejoiced
that
they
were
no
longer
so
lonely
henceforth
they
every
day
drove
their
flocks
to
the
same
place
they
did
not
speak
much
but
they
felt
comforted
one
evening
when
the
full
moon
was
shining
in
the
sky
and
the
sheep
were
already
at
rest
the
shepherd
pulled
the
flute
out
of
his
pocket
and
played
on
it
a
beautiful
but
sorrowful
air
when
he
had
finished
he
saw
that
the
shepherdess
was
weeping
bitterly
why
are
you
weeping
he
asked
alas
answered
she
thus
shone
the
full
moon
when
i
played
this
air
on
the
flute
for
the
last
time
and
the
head
of
my
beloved
rose
out
of
the
he
looked
at
her
and
it
seemed
as
if
a
veil
fell
from
his
eyes
and
he
recognized
his
dear
wife
and
when
she
looked
at
him
and
the
moon
shone
in
his
face
she
knew
him
also
they
embraced
and
kissed
each
other
and
no
one
need
ask
if
they
were
happy
illustration
the
little
house
in
the
wood
a
poor
woodcutter
lived
with
his
wife
and
three
daughters
in
a
little
hut
on
the
edge
of
a
lonely
wood
one
morning
as
he
was
about
to
go
to
his
work
he
said
to
his
wife
let
my
dinner
be
brought
into
the
wood
to
me
by
my
eldest
daughter
or
i
shall
never
get
my
work
done
and
in
order
that
she
may
not
miss
her
way
he
added
i
will
take
a
bag
of
millet
with
me
and
strew
the
seeds
on
the
when
therefore
the
sun
was
just
above
the
centre
of
the
wood
the
girl
set
out
on
her
way
with
a
bowl
of
soup
but
the
and
larks
and
finches
blackbirds
and
siskins
had
picked
up
the
millet
long
before
and
the
girl
could
not
find
the
track
then
trusting
to
chance
she
went
on
and
on
until
the
sun
sank
and
night
began
to
fall
the
trees
rustled
in
the
darkness
the
owls
hooted
and
she
began
to
be
afraid
then
in
the
distance
she
perceived
a
light
which
glimmered
between
the
trees
there
ought
to
be
some
people
living
there
who
can
take
me
in
for
the
night
thought
she
and
went
up
to
the
light
it
was
not
long
before
she
came
to
a
house
the
windows
of
which
were
all
lighted
up
she
knocked
and
a
rough
voice
from
the
inside
cried
come
the
girl
stepped
into
the
dark
entrance
and
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
room
just
come
in
cried
the
voice
and
when
she
opened
the
door
an
old
man
was
sitting
at
the
table
supporting
his
face
with
both
hands
and
his
white
beard
fell
down
over
the
table
almost
as
far
as
the
ground
by
the
stove
lay
three
animals
a
hen
a
cock
and
a
brindled
cow
the
girl
told
her
story
to
the
old
man
and
begged
for
shelter
for
the
night
the
man
said
little
hen
pretty
little
cock
and
pretty
brindled
cow
what
say
ye
all
now
answered
the
animals
and
that
must
have
meant
we
are
willing
for
the
old
man
said
here
you
shall
have
shelter
and
food
go
to
the
fire
and
cook
us
our
the
girl
found
in
the
kitchen
abundance
of
everything
and
cooked
a
good
supper
but
had
no
thought
of
the
animals
she
carried
the
full
dishes
to
the
table
seated
herself
by
the
man
ate
and
satisfied
her
hunger
when
she
had
had
enough
she
said
but
now
i
am
tired
where
is
there
a
bed
in
which
i
can
lie
down
and
sleep
the
animals
replied
hast
eaten
with
him
thou
hast
drunk
with
him
thou
hast
had
no
thought
for
us
so
find
out
for
thyself
where
thou
canst
pass
the
then
said
the
old
man
just
go
and
you
will
find
a
room
with
two
beds
shake
them
up
and
put
white
linen
on
them
and
then
i
too
will
come
and
lie
down
to
the
girl
went
up
and
when
she
had
shaken
the
beds
and
put
clean
sheets
on
she
lay
down
in
one
of
them
without
waiting
any
longer
for
the
old
man
after
some
time
however
the
man
came
took
his
candle
looked
at
the
girl
and
shook
his
head
when
he
saw
that
she
had
fallen
into
a
sound
sleep
he
opened
a
and
let
her
down
into
the
cellar
late
at
night
the
woodcutter
came
home
and
reproached
his
wife
for
leaving
him
to
hunger
all
day
it
is
not
my
fault
she
replied
the
girl
went
out
with
your
dinner
and
must
have
lost
herself
but
she
is
sure
to
come
back
the
woodcutter
however
arose
before
dawn
to
go
into
the
wood
and
requested
that
the
second
daughter
should
take
him
his
dinner
that
day
i
will
take
a
bag
with
lentils
said
he
the
seeds
are
larger
than
millet
the
girl
will
see
them
better
and
can
t
lose
her
at
therefore
the
girl
took
out
the
food
but
the
lentils
had
disappeared
the
birds
of
the
wood
had
picked
them
up
as
they
had
done
the
day
before
and
had
left
none
the
girl
wandered
about
in
the
wood
until
night
and
then
she
too
reached
the
house
of
the
old
man
was
told
to
go
in
and
begged
for
food
and
a
bed
the
man
with
the
white
beard
again
asked
the
animals
little
hen
little
cock
pretty
brindled
cow
say
ye
all
now
the
animals
again
replied
and
everything
happened
just
as
it
had
happened
the
day
before
the
girl
cooked
a
good
meal
ate
and
drank
with
the
old
man
and
did
not
concern
herself
about
the
animals
and
when
she
inquired
about
her
bed
they
answered
hast
eaten
with
him
hast
drunk
with
him
hast
had
no
thought
for
us
find
out
for
thyself
where
thou
canst
pass
the
when
she
was
asleep
the
old
man
came
looked
at
her
shook
his
head
and
let
her
down
into
the
cellar
on
the
third
morning
the
woodcutter
said
to
his
wife
send
our
youngest
child
out
with
my
dinner
she
has
always
been
good
and
obedient
and
will
stay
in
the
right
path
and
not
run
about
after
every
wild
bumblebee
as
her
sisters
the
mother
did
not
want
to
do
it
and
said
am
i
to
lose
my
dearest
child
as
well
have
no
fear
he
replied
the
girl
will
not
go
astray
she
is
too
prudent
and
sensible
besides
i
will
take
some
peas
with
me
and
strew
them
about
they
are
still
larger
than
lentils
and
will
show
her
the
but
when
the
girl
went
out
with
her
basket
on
her
arm
the
had
already
got
all
the
peas
in
their
crops
and
she
did
not
know
which
way
to
turn
she
was
full
of
sorrow
and
never
ceased
to
think
how
hungry
her
father
would
be
and
how
her
good
mother
would
grieve
if
she
did
not
return
home
at
length
when
it
grew
dark
she
saw
the
light
and
came
to
the
house
in
the
wood
she
begged
quite
prettily
to
be
allowed
to
spend
the
night
there
and
the
man
with
the
white
beard
once
more
asked
his
animals
little
hen
pretty
little
cock
and
pretty
brindled
cow
what
say
ye
all
now
said
they
then
the
girl
went
to
the
stove
where
the
animals
were
lying
and
petted
the
cock
and
hen
and
stroked
their
smooth
feathers
with
her
hand
and
caressed
the
brindled
cow
between
her
horns
and
when
in
obedience
to
the
old
man
s
orders
she
had
made
ready
some
good
soup
and
the
bowl
was
placed
upon
the
table
she
said
am
i
to
eat
as
much
as
i
want
and
the
good
animals
to
have
nothing
outside
is
food
in
plenty
i
will
look
after
them
so
she
went
and
brought
some
barley
and
strewed
it
for
the
cock
and
hen
and
a
whole
armful
of
hay
for
the
cow
i
hope
you
will
like
it
dear
animals
said
she
and
you
shall
have
a
refreshing
draught
in
case
you
are
then
she
fetched
in
a
bucketful
of
water
and
the
cock
and
hen
jumped
on
to
the
edge
of
it
and
dipped
their
beaks
in
then
held
up
their
heads
as
the
birds
do
when
they
drink
and
the
brindled
cow
also
took
a
hearty
draught
when
the
animals
were
fed
the
girl
seated
herself
at
the
table
by
the
old
man
and
ate
what
he
had
left
it
was
not
long
before
the
cock
and
the
hen
began
to
thrust
their
heads
beneath
their
wings
and
the
eyes
of
the
cow
likewise
began
to
blink
then
said
the
girl
ought
we
not
to
go
to
bed
little
hen
pretty
little
cock
and
pretty
brindled
cow
what
say
ye
all
now
the
animals
answered
hast
eaten
with
us
thou
hast
drunk
with
us
thou
hast
had
kind
thought
for
all
of
us
we
wish
thee
then
the
girl
went
shook
the
and
laid
clean
sheets
on
them
and
when
she
had
done
it
the
old
man
came
and
lay
down
on
one
of
the
beds
and
his
white
beard
reached
down
to
his
feet
the
girl
lay
down
on
the
other
said
her
prayers
and
fell
asleep
she
slept
quietly
till
midnight
and
then
there
was
such
a
noise
in
the
house
that
she
awoke
there
was
a
sound
of
cracking
and
splitting
in
every
corner
the
doors
sprang
open
and
beat
against
the
walls
the
beams
groaned
as
if
they
were
being
torn
out
of
their
joints
it
seemed
as
if
the
staircase
were
falling
down
and
at
length
there
was
a
crash
as
if
the
entire
roof
had
fallen
in
as
however
all
grew
quiet
once
more
and
the
girl
was
not
hurt
she
stayed
quietly
lying
where
she
was
and
fell
asleep
again
but
when
she
woke
up
in
the
morning
with
the
brilliancy
of
the
sunshine
what
did
her
eyes
behold
she
was
lying
in
a
vast
hall
and
everything
around
her
shone
with
royal
splendor
on
the
walls
golden
flowers
grew
up
on
a
ground
of
green
silk
the
bed
was
of
ivory
and
the
canopy
of
red
velvet
and
on
a
chair
close
by
was
a
pair
of
shoes
embroidered
with
pearls
the
girl
believed
that
she
was
in
a
dream
but
three
richly
clad
attendants
came
in
and
asked
what
orders
she
would
like
to
give
if
you
will
go
she
replied
i
will
get
up
at
once
and
make
ready
some
soup
for
the
old
man
and
then
i
will
feed
the
pretty
little
hen
and
the
cock
and
the
beautiful
brindled
she
thought
the
old
man
was
up
already
and
looked
round
at
his
bed
he
however
was
not
lying
in
it
but
a
stranger
and
while
she
was
looking
at
him
and
becoming
aware
that
he
was
young
and
handsome
he
awoke
sat
up
in
bed
and
said
i
am
a
king
s
son
and
was
enchanted
by
a
wicked
witch
and
made
to
live
in
this
wood
as
an
old
man
no
one
was
allowed
to
be
with
me
but
my
three
attendants
in
the
form
of
a
cock
a
hen
and
a
brindled
cow
the
spell
was
not
to
be
broken
until
a
girl
came
to
us
whose
heart
was
so
good
that
she
showed
herself
full
of
love
not
only
toward
mankind
but
toward
animals
and
that
you
have
done
and
by
you
at
midnight
we
were
set
free
and
the
old
house
in
the
wood
was
changed
back
again
into
my
royal
and
when
they
had
arisen
the
king
s
son
ordered
the
three
attendants
to
set
out
and
fetch
the
father
and
mother
of
the
girl
to
the
marriage
feast
but
where
are
my
two
sisters
inquired
the
girl
i
have
locked
them
in
the
cellar
and
they
shall
be
led
into
the
wood
and
shall
live
as
servants
to
a
until
they
have
grown
kinder
and
do
not
leave
poor
animals
to
suffer
illustration
maid
maleen
there
was
once
a
king
who
had
a
son
who
asked
in
marriage
the
daughter
of
a
mighty
king
she
was
called
maid
maleen
and
was
very
beautiful
as
her
father
wished
to
give
her
to
another
the
prince
was
rejected
but
since
they
both
loved
each
other
with
all
their
hearts
they
would
not
give
each
other
up
and
maid
maleen
said
to
her
father
i
can
and
will
take
no
other
for
my
then
the
king
flew
into
a
passion
and
ordered
a
dark
tower
to
be
built
into
which
no
ray
of
sunlight
or
moonlight
should
enter
when
it
was
finished
he
said
therein
shall
you
be
imprisoned
for
seven
years
and
then
i
will
come
and
see
if
your
perverse
spirit
is
meat
and
drink
for
the
seven
years
were
carried
into
the
tower
and
then
she
and
her
were
led
into
it
and
walled
up
and
thus
cut
off
from
the
sky
and
from
the
earth
there
they
sat
in
the
darkness
and
knew
not
when
day
or
night
began
the
king
s
son
often
went
round
and
round
the
tower
and
called
their
names
but
no
sound
from
without
pierced
through
the
thick
walls
what
else
could
they
do
but
lament
and
complain
meanwhile
the
time
passed
and
by
the
small
amount
of
food
and
drink
left
they
knew
that
the
seven
years
were
coming
to
an
end
they
thought
the
moment
of
their
deliverance
was
come
but
no
stroke
of
the
hammer
was
heard
no
stone
fell
out
of
the
wall
and
it
seemed
to
maid
maleen
that
her
father
had
forgotten
her
as
they
had
food
for
only
a
short
time
longer
and
saw
a
miserable
death
awaiting
them
maid
maleen
said
we
must
try
our
last
chance
and
see
if
we
can
break
through
the
she
took
the
and
picked
and
bored
at
the
mortar
of
a
stone
and
when
she
was
tired
the
took
her
turn
with
great
labor
they
succeeded
in
getting
out
one
stone
then
a
second
and
third
and
when
three
days
were
over
the
first
ray
of
light
fell
on
their
darkness
and
at
last
the
opening
was
so
large
that
they
could
look
out
the
sky
was
blue
and
a
fresh
breeze
played
on
their
faces
but
how
melancholy
everything
looked
all
around
her
father
s
castle
lay
in
ruins
the
town
and
the
villages
were
so
far
as
could
be
seen
destroyed
by
fire
the
fields
far
and
wide
laid
to
waste
and
no
human
being
was
visible
when
the
opening
in
the
wall
was
large
enough
for
them
to
slip
through
the
sprang
down
first
and
then
maid
maleen
followed
but
where
were
they
to
go
the
enemy
had
ravaged
the
whole
kingdom
driven
away
the
king
and
slain
all
the
inhabitants
they
wandered
forth
to
seek
another
country
but
nowhere
did
they
find
a
shelter
or
a
human
being
to
give
them
a
mouthful
of
bread
their
need
was
so
great
that
they
were
forced
to
appease
their
hunger
with
when
after
long
journeying
they
came
into
another
country
they
tried
to
get
work
everywhere
but
wherever
they
knocked
they
were
turned
away
and
no
one
would
have
pity
on
them
at
last
they
arrived
in
a
large
city
and
went
to
the
royal
palace
there
also
they
were
ordered
to
go
away
but
at
last
the
cook
said
that
they
might
stay
in
the
kitchen
and
be
scullions
the
king
s
son
in
whose
kingdom
they
were
was
however
the
very
man
who
had
been
betrothed
to
maid
maleen
his
father
had
chosen
another
bride
for
him
whose
face
was
as
ugly
as
her
heart
was
wicked
the
wedding
was
fixed
and
the
girl
had
already
arrived
because
of
her
great
ugliness
however
she
shut
herself
in
her
room
and
allowed
no
one
to
see
her
and
maid
maleen
had
to
take
her
her
meals
from
the
kitchen
when
the
day
came
for
the
bride
and
the
bridegroom
to
go
to
church
she
was
ashamed
of
her
ugliness
and
afraid
that
if
she
showed
herself
in
the
streets
she
would
be
mocked
and
laughed
at
by
the
people
then
said
she
to
maid
maleen
a
great
piece
of
luck
has
befallen
you
i
have
sprained
my
foot
and
can
not
walk
through
the
streets
you
shall
put
on
my
and
take
my
place
a
greater
honor
than
that
you
can
not
have
maid
maleen
however
refused
it
and
said
i
wish
for
no
honor
which
is
not
suitable
for
illustration
the
prince
took
her
by
the
hand
and
led
her
to
church
it
was
in
vain
too
that
the
bride
offered
her
gold
at
last
she
said
angrily
if
you
do
not
obey
me
it
shall
cost
you
your
life
i
have
but
to
speak
the
word
and
your
head
will
lie
at
your
then
she
was
forced
to
obey
and
put
on
the
bride
s
magnificent
clothes
and
all
her
jewels
when
she
entered
the
royal
hall
every
one
was
amazed
at
her
great
beauty
and
the
king
said
to
his
son
this
is
the
bride
whom
i
have
chosen
for
you
and
whom
you
must
lead
to
the
bridegroom
was
astonished
and
thought
she
is
like
my
maid
maleen
and
i
should
believe
that
it
was
she
herself
but
she
has
long
been
shut
up
in
the
tower
or
he
took
her
by
the
hand
and
led
her
to
church
on
the
way
was
a
and
she
said
so
small
what
are
you
doing
here
alone
by
the
wall
i
have
the
time
known
when
unroasted
unboiled
i
ate
thee
alone
what
are
you
saying
asked
the
king
s
son
nothing
she
replied
i
was
only
thinking
of
maid
he
was
surprised
that
she
knew
about
her
but
kept
silence
when
they
came
to
the
into
the
churchyard
she
said
break
not
i
am
not
the
true
what
are
you
saying
there
asked
the
king
s
son
nothing
she
replied
i
was
only
thinking
of
maid
when
they
came
to
the
she
said
once
more
break
not
i
am
not
the
true
what
are
you
saying
there
asked
he
ah
she
answered
i
was
only
thinking
of
maid
then
he
took
out
a
precious
chain
put
it
round
her
neck
and
fastened
the
clasp
thereupon
they
entered
the
church
and
the
priest
joined
their
hands
together
before
the
altar
and
married
them
he
led
her
home
but
she
did
not
speak
a
single
word
the
whole
way
when
they
got
back
to
the
royal
palace
she
hurried
into
the
bride
s
chamber
put
off
the
magnificent
clothes
and
the
jewels
dressed
herself
in
her
gray
gown
and
kept
nothing
but
the
jewel
on
her
neck
which
she
had
received
from
the
bridegroom
when
the
night
came
and
the
bride
was
to
be
led
into
the
apartment
of
the
king
s
son
she
let
her
veil
fall
over
her
face
that
he
might
not
observe
the
deception
as
soon
as
every
one
had
gone
away
he
said
to
her
what
did
you
say
to
the
which
was
growing
by
the
wayside
to
which
asked
she
i
don
t
talk
to
if
you
did
not
do
it
then
you
are
not
the
true
bride
said
he
so
she
bethought
herself
and
said

go
my
maid
to
see
who
keeps
my
secret
thoughts
for

back
into
the
chamber
and

nettle
and
she
repeated
the
words
which
she
had
just
heard

when
we

that
they
must
