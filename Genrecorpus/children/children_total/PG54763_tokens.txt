one
moment
please
in
a
way
this
book
little
homespun
is
a
story
quite
by
itself
in
another
way
it
is
a
sequel
to
courage
although
you
can
catch
its
thread
without
having
read
a
line
of
now
some
grown
people
and
i
presume
some
children
do
not
care
for
sequels
at
all
but
i
happen
to
know
that
the
children
who
are
good
enough
to
read
and
care
for
my
stories
are
fond
of
sequels
those
who
have
taken
the
trouble
to
write
me
in
little
letters
that
are
worth
their
weight
in
gold
many
times
over
almost
invariably
ask
for
another
book
about
the
same
people
sometimes
they
tell
me
just
what
to
put
into
the
new
story
and
what
name
to
give
it
so
here
lies
my
excuse
if
one
is
needed
for
writing
little
besides
i
could
hardly
help
it
for
there
seemed
to
be
quite
a
little
yet
to
tell
about
courage
and
sylvia
and
some
new
little
friends
of
theirs
and
one
thing
more
everything
in
this
story
that
has
to
do
with
real
people
or
actual
events
is
absolutely
true
a
little
book
named
historic
arlington
giving
most
of
the
information
needed
even
old
black
joe
has
his
counterpart
in
wesley
morris

of
the
slaves
of
custis
born
on
the
estate
and
employed
for
many
years
following
the
war
as

chapter
two
old
cronies
june
morning
clear
and
cool
as
october
and
everything
far
and
near
fairly
revelling
in
the
early
summer
sunshine
the
potomac
blue
as
the
sky
above
it
sparkling
and
dancing
the
new
young
leaves
on
the
oak
trees
shimmering
and
shining
with
the
marvellous
green
of
springtime
and
the
dear
old
virginia
homestead
overhanging
the
river
never
looking
more
homelike
and
attractive
in
all
its
quiet
life
the
reason
for
this
did
not
lie
all
in
the
sunshine
either
just
outside
the
door
on
the
wide
gallery
a
darling
old
lady
sat
knitting
for
as
means
dearly
beloved
no
other
word
could
so
truly
describe
her
everybody
worshipped
her
and
regarded
her
as
well
they
might
with
unspeakable
devotion
for
darling
old
ladies
as
you
very
well
know
do
not
grow
on
every
bush
quite
to
the
contrary
a
great
many
old
ladies
bless
their
tired
old
hearts
grow
fretful
and
nervous
and
fussy
and
are
hard
to
please
not
to
say
cranky
but
who
would
blame
them
for
this
for
a
minute
just
as
likely
as
not
you
and
i
will
be
cranky
enough
ourselves
when
we
have
borne
the
burden
of
fourscore
years
and
are
pretty
well
worn
out
in
mind
and
spirit
and
body
but
here
was
an
old
lady
who
was
not
worn
out
her
hair
was
white
with
the
incomparable
whiteness
of
aged
hair
and
there
were
the
indelible
marks
of
age
on
the
sweet
earnest
face
but
this
dear
old
lady
was
she
had
had
her
own
full
share
of
sorrows
and
worries
and
she
had
taken
them
all
very
much
to
heart
as
people
must
whose
hearts
are
big
enough
to
take
things
to
at
all
and
as
tender
as
hearts
really
ought
to
be
but
somehow
or
other
she
had
learned
the
secret
of
not
being
overcome
by
the
worries
and
the
sorrows
and
so
sitting
there
knitting
that
peerless
june
morning
she
and
the
sunshine
together
seemed
to
glorify
everything
about
them
illustration
presently
a
little
specimen
appeared
in
the
doorway
a
handsome
little
fellow
too
though
he
did
not
have
any
curls
as
most
children
do
who
find
their
way
into
story
books
but
his
hair
was
golden
and
though
cut
quite
short
as
he
insisted
upon
having
it
had
a
little
trick
of
straying
down
on
his
forehead
in
quite
irresistible
fashion
well
what
are
we
going
to
do
said
his
grandmother
gazing
at
him
as
fondly
as
only
fond
grandmothers
can
in
response
the
little
fellow
merely
pointed
to
two
straps
of
gold
braid
upon
his
shoulders
and
looked
as
though
really
should
have
known
better
than
to
ask
oh
beg
pardon
brevet
i
was
so
intent
upon
my
knitting
i
had
not
noticed
and
she
succeeded
in
foiling
a
smile
that
would
at
least
have
proved
annoying
for
as
every
one
about
the
place
knew
the
gold
worn
in
imitation
of
a
captain
s
uniform
in
the
army
meant
but
one
thing
and
that
was
that
captain
joe
was
coming
down
to
carry
up
to
arlington
for
the
day
indeed
at
that
moment
a
cheery
how
dy
brevet
rang
out
on
the
still
morning
air
and
at
the
same
moment
a
donkey
and
a
cart
driven
by
an
old
negro
came
to
a
stand
at
the
gate
how
dy
captain
i
m
ready
for
you
been
expecting
you
ev
ry
minute
since
breakfast
take
good
care
of
yourself
and
a
pair
of
chubby
arms
gave
grandmamma
just
about
as
much
of
a
hug
as
the
old
lady
could
bear
up
under
miss
lindy
said
captain
joe
stepping
up
to
the
gate
and
touching
his
cap
deferentially
i
spose
the
little
un
tol
you
i
d
like
him
up
to
arlington
fur
de
day
if
you
could
spare
no
joe
answered
ellis
smiling
brevet
does
not
think
that
necessary
he
simply
dons
the
blue
reefer
with
the
and
that
means
he
has
his
orders
for
the
day
from
his
captain
and
grandmammas
are
not
expected
to
ask
brevet
stood
by
his
hands
upon
his
hips
in
most
independent
fashion
as
much
as
to
say
that
describes
the
case
well
i
reckon
he
don
mean
no
harm
miss
lindy
said
joe
a
little
anxiously
he
s
dat
much
in
earnest
bout
everythin
dat
he
s
a
n
sure
nuff
when
he

straps

joe
answered
ellis
but
we
ll
just
send
for
you
if
the
day
comes
when
we
need
to
him
for
brevet
did
not
at
all
understand
this
last
remark
and
so
touching
his
little
blue
cap
in
true
turned
on
his
heel
and
marched
down
to
the
as
though
in
command
of
an
army
brevet
said
joe
seriously
as
they
jogged
away
from
the
gate

i
joe
said
brevet
solemnly
his
voice
trembling
a
little
i
could
not
bear
it
if
you
took
away
my
straps
and
he
laid
a
little
brown
hand
protectingly
upon
one
shoulder
well
den
you

a

honey
bout
miss
lindy
an

joe
invites
you

but
you
re
yo

little
pickaninny
eb
ry
day
in
de
week
and
don
you
forget
i
ll
remember
captain
with
most
soldierlike
submission
and
then
for
awhile
they
drove
along
in
silence
happy
thoughts
of
anticipation
however
soon
chased
the
troubled
look
from
brevet
s
little
face
for
there
was
nothing
at
all
could
compare
with
these
occasional
days
spent
with
joe
at
arlington
it
was
owing
to
them
that
he
had
gained
his
title
of
brevet
and
the
blue
and
the
joe
had
been
a
member
of
a
coloured
regiment
and
had
fought
all
through
the
war
and
when
at
last
he
had
come
back
and
had
settled
down
in
his
old
cabin
at
arlington
he
was
dubbed
captain
in
recognition
of
his
gallant
services
by
all
the
coloured
folk
of
the
neighbourhood
and
joe
was
by
no
means
unworthy
of
the
honour
for
save
for
the
fact
that
his
regiment
had
been
officered
by
white
men
he
might
easily
have
risen
to
the
command
of
a
company
time
and
time
again
in
the
face
of
the
greatest
danger
he
had
been
notoriously
fearless
and
had
never
in
a
single
instance
shown
the
white
feather
which
is
more
than
can
be
said
for
many
of
his
black
comrades
and
so
from
that
time
on
it
had
been
captain
joe
and
when
some
thirty
years
later
little
howard
ellis
came
to
make
his
home
with
his
grandmother
and
soon
afterward
came
to
know
joe
and
to
spend
many
a
long
summer
day
in
his
delightful
company
what
more
natural
than
that
the
little
fellow
with
his
great
passion
for
everything
military
should
first
aspire
to
some
of
the
outward
insignia
and
then
having
attained
cap
and
by
favour
of
his
grandmother
should
later
be
dowered
with
the
title
of
by
favour
of
captain
joe
himself
illustration
you
see
it
s
des
de
name
fur
you
honey
joe
had
explained
case
it
ll
save
any
n
of
us
togedder
an
at
de
same
time
it
s
a
very
complimentin
title
it
means
es
how
you
have
it
des
as
a
sort
of
honour
widout
havin
any
of
de
sponsibilities
of
an
cap
n
like
from
that
day
forward
it
was
very
tenaciously
insisted
upon
by
howard
himself
but
gradually
allowed
to
be
abbreviated
to
brevet
within
the
home
circle
and
so
captain
joe
and
brevet
having
long
ago
arrived
at
the
most
satisfactory
mutual
understanding
sat
side
by
side
in
the
without
feeling
the
slightest
obligation
to
say
a
word
the
road
from
the
ellis
homestead
up
to
arlington
lies
through
the
woods
and
has
all
the
charm
of
a
road
that
has
been
left
to
follow
its
own
way
and
a
sweet
wild
way
at
that
there
were
no
fences
either
new
or
old
for
none
were
needed
on
each
side
a
forest
of
oak
interspersed
with
an
occasional
maple
or
chestnut
stretched
miles
away
with
seldom
a
glimpse
of
a
clearing
while
immediately
bordering
the
road
grew
the
veriest
tangle
of
a
natural
abloom
with
some
sort
of
sweet
from
may
to
october
the
original
cut
through
the
wood
had
been
happily
a
wide
one
and
so
sunshine
and
shower
even
after
all
these
years
still
had
abundant
chance
to
slant
this
way
and
that
across
the
road
and
coax
every
growing
thing
to
perfection
white
and
yellow
and
purple
peered
out
from
under
the
taller
growths
of
fern
in
the
early
springtime
june
brought
the
sweet
wild
rose
unfolding
bud
after
bud
well
into
the
summer
and
the
white
of
the
briars
with
august
came
the
berries
themselves
ripening
ungathered
in
riotous
profusion
and
following
close
upon
them
advance
heralds
of
the
goldenrod
and
the
asters
it
was
in
very
truth
a
beautiful
dear
old
road
and
it
formed
a
beautiful
setting
for
the
little
cart
slowly
making
its
way
along
it
a
pretty
contrast
too
that
of
the
old
negro
still
alert
and
sturdy
notwithstanding
his
threescore
years
and
ten
with
the
little
boy
beside
him
together
they
seemed
the
embodiment
of
happy
confiding
childhood
and
trustful
serene
old
age
on
came
the
little
cart
each
of
its
occupants
apparently
intent
upon
his
own
thoughts
until
at
last
brevet
commenced
humming
a
sweet
little
refrain
very
softly
and
slowly
at
first
as
though
not
quite
sure
of
his
ground
then
more
distinctly
as
he
felt
himself
master
of
the
situation
finally
the
refrain
took
to
itself
words
words
that
have
since
grown
commonplace
but
which
had
all
the
charm
of
novelty
for
joe
and
he
listened
with
absorbed
delight
as
brevet
sang
cutely
i

little

i

in
a

so
reluctant
was
joe
to
have
his
keen
enjoyment
for
one
moment
interrupted
and
brevet
obeyed
keeping
the
air
perfectly
and
singing
with
all
his
heart
too
as
though
himself
a
veritable
little
pickaninny
dwelling
upon
the

brevet
put
his
brown
hand
in
joe
s
black
one
his
own
face
beaming
with
the
pleasure
he
had
given
and
so
the
two
boon
companions
jogged
on
until
high
on
a
hill
before
them
the
pillars
of
a
fine
old
house
came
into
view
and
a
few
moments
later
the
drew
up
at
a
little
cabin
just
in
the
rear
of
the
fine
old
house
a
cabin
that
had
been
joe
s
home
ever
since
he
was
as
little
a
fellow
as
brevet
there
beside
him
i
ll
look
around
while
you
put
jennie
up
explained
brevet
as
soon
as
joe
had
lifted
him
from
the
cart
and
putting
his
hands
in
his
pockets
he
walked
up
to
the
big
house
straight
through
the
hall
whose
doors
stood
wide
open
and
out
on
to
the
porch
in
front
brevet
simply
loved
to
look
around
from
that
porch
and
i
do
not
think
he
ever
stood
there
without
his
resolve
to
be
a
soldier
some
day
surging
up
in
a
strong
new
tide
within
him
some
of
the
rest
of
us
who
are
quite
too
old
ever
to
think
of
being
soldiers
and
whose
petticoats
must
at
any
age
have
stood
in
the
way
know
exactly
how
brevet
felt
you
know
too
if
you
have
ever
been
to
arlington
and
having
been
born
and
bred
in
these
united
states
of
ours
are
the
true
little
american
you
really
ought
to
be
but
in
case
you
never
been
to
arlington
and
do
not
at
all
know
why
it
should
make
you
feel
that
you
would
like
to
be
a
soldier
then
let
me
tell
you
before
you
have
read
another
single
line
that
arlington
is
the
great
national
cemetery
lying
a
few
miles
out
from
washington
and
where
more
than
fifteen
thousand
soldiers
lie
buried
from
the
moment
you
enter
the
beautiful
grounds
you
see
the
low
mounds
stretching
away
on
every
side
of
you
and
when
you
drive
up
in
front
of
arlington
house
itself
there
is
brave
general
sheridan
s
tomb
right
in
front
of
you
so
you
can
not
forget
for
a
moment
what
a
host
of
noble
heroes
they
were
who
fought
in
our
great
civil
war
thirty
years
ago
and
how
grand
a
thing
it
is
lo
be
willing
to
lay
down
one
s
life
if
need
be
for
the
honour
of
one
s
country
but
perhaps
you
wonder
that
there
should
be
a
fine
old
house
in
a
cemetery
and
that
brevet
should
so
love
to
go
there
thinking
a
cemetery
for
your
part
rather
sad
and
depressing
and
wonder
too
why
joe
should
have
chosen
such
a
place
for
his
home
all
of
which
wonders
it
would
take
too
much
time
to
explain
in
this
chapter
a
chapter
that
was
only
meant
to
introduce
you
to
brevet
and
the
captain
so
for
just
now
to
arlington
chapter
courage
takes
heart
this
time
as
before
there
is
a
story
to
tell
because
of
something
braved
and
dared
for
miss
julia
s
sake
something
that
needed
less
nerve
perhaps
than
the
leap
courage
took
that
night
on
the
drawbridge
but
something
that
called
not
only
for
a
world
of
a
different
sort
of
courage
but
for
infinite
patience
as
well
and
that
claimed
the
whole
summer
for
its
doing
the
reason
for
it
all
lay
in
four
little
words
miss
julia
was
dead
beautiful
strong
radiant
miss
julia
why
no
one
had
thought
of
death
for
her
save
as
years
and
years
away
in
the
serene
twilight
of
a
calm
old
age
and
yet
it
had
come
suddenly
after
a
week
s
brief
illness
and
courage
was
simply
she
felt
she
had
no
right
to
her
name
now
and
never
should
have
again
miss
julia
had
been
teacher
mother
friend
to
her
one
or
the
other
almost
since
her
babyhood
and
to
care
for
miss
julia
in
return
now
that
she
herself
was
grown
up
to
let
every
thing
else
come
second
had
been
her
only
thought
and
now
to
find
her
hands
suddenly
empty
and
all
the
sunshine
gone
out
of
her
life
was
it
strange
that
she
felt
despairing
and
desolate
and
that
nothing
whatever
was
left
but
we
are
left
pleaded
a
chorus
of
little
voices
and
courage
seemed
to
see
four
brighteyed
little
children
because
god
had
made
them
so
but
with
faces
almost
as
sad
as
her
own
yes
we
are
left
they
continued
pleading
miss
julia
was
going
to
do
so
much
for
us
this
summer
could
not
you
do
it
in
her
place
for
her
sake
courage
shook
her
head
gravely
as
in
answer
to
her
own
thoughts
no
i
can
not
she
said
firmly
everything
that
i
leaned
on
is
gone
nothing
is
left
to
me
but
could
you
not
try
just
for
her
sake
chorused
the
little
voices
over
and
over
in
her
heart
day
after
day
in
all
the
sad
hours
of
waking
and
sometimes
even
in
sleeping
until
at
last
she
bravely
brushed
the
tears
away
and
made
answer
yes
for
her
sake
i
will
she
remembered
the
day
of
her
christening
when
her
remarkable
name
had
been
given
her
and
she
had
asked
is
courage
something
that
people
have
papa
have
i
got
it
and
he
had
told
her
courage
is
something
that
people
have
dear
something
fine
and
i
hope
you
will
have
yes
she
would
try
even
in
this
dark
hour
to
live
up
to
her
father
s
hope
for
her
and
so
her
resolve
was
taken
but
the
four
little
children
knew
nothing
of
any
resolve
they
would
not
have
understood
what
it
meant
if
they
had
and
as
for
their
singing
a
pathetic
little
chorus
in
any
one
s
heart
they
were
altogether
unconscious
of
that
as
well
but
one
thing
they
did
know
and
that
was
they
should
never
see
miss
julia
again
in
this
world
and
they
thought
they
also
knew
that
a
beautiful
plan
she
had
made
for
them
could
never
be
carried
out
the
wisest
thing
therefore
for
these
four
little
people
was
to
put
so
far
as
possible
all
thought
of
the
plan
from
their
minds
and
mary
the
eldest
of
the
four
said
as
much
to
the
others
oh
don
t
let
us
think
about
it
any
more
she
urged
earnestly
if
we
only
could
have
miss
julia
back
what
would
we
care
for
anything
else
besides
when
you
think
what
has
happened
it
seems
selfish
and
as
though
we
did
not
have
any
hearts
to
grieve
over
our
own
little
plans
for
a
but
it
wasn
t
just
over
our
own
little
plan
insisted
her
younger
brother
teddy
it
was
miss
julia
s
plan
for
us
and
i
don
t
think
it
strange
a
bit
that
we
should
grieve
over
neither
do
i
urged
allan
who
came
next
to
teddy
in
age
of
course
us
boys
not
going
to
the
did
not
know
miss
julia
as
well
as
you
but
i
just
guess
there
wasn
t
a
boy
who
thought
more
of
her
than
i
did
what
s
more
i
loved
her
not
making
a
fuss
over
her
to
be
sure
like
you
girls
still
i
did
really
love
her
emphasising
the
word
by
a
shake
of
his
head
and
firm
pursing
of
his
lips
all
the
same
i
think
it
s
natural
we
should
feel
awfully
gertrude
who
was
seven
and
the
youngest
of
the
four
nodded
in
approval
of
the
stand
allan
had
taken
and
continued
nodding
as
he
added
we
haven
t
travelled
so
much
seems
to
me
or
had
so
much
change
in
our
lives
as
to
settle
back
to
the
idea
of
a
hot
summer
here
in
town
instead
of
going
to
the
country
without
feeling
it
a
bit
that
is
i
don
t
think
we
illustration
mary
sighed
and
said
nothing
as
though
ready
to
admit
after
all
that
perhaps
it
was
natural
that
they
should
take
their
disappointment
somewhat
to
heart
but
the
tears
that
had
sprung
suddenly
into
her
eyes
were
from
real
longing
for
miss
julia
and
not
from
the
disappointment
this
quiet
talk
in
which
the
little
bennetts
were
indulging
was
being
carried
on
from
the
backs
of
two
horses
the
two
girls
mounted
upon
one
and
the
two
boys
astride
the
other
but
they
happened
to
be
the
quietest
horses
in
the
world
horses
that
never
budged
in
fact
tailless
and
headless
and
that
belonged
to
the
carpenter
who
lived
on
the
first
floor
the
bennetts
lived
on
the
top
floor
but
whenever
there
was
anything
to
be
talked
over
down
they
trooped
to
the
yard
and
climbed
and
helped
each
other
to
the
backs
of
these
high
seats
and
when
all
were
able
to
declare
themselves
perfectly
comfortable
the
conclave
would
commence
the
little
bennetts
were
great
talkers
they
simply
loved
to
discuss
things
and
this
shows
when
you
stop
to
consider
it
that
they
must
be
on
the
whole
an
amiable
little
family
for
some
little
people
that
we
hear
of
are
quite
too
impatient
and
to
be
willing
to
discuss
things
at
all
but
whatever
may
have
been
the
faults
of
the
little
bennetts
they
did
have
respect
for
each
other
s
opinions
and
were
generally
ready
to
admit
that
two
heads
were
better
than
one
and
four
heads
to
quote
little
gertrude
four
times
as
this
habit
of
discussion
for
it
really
amounted
to
that
was
partly
no
doubt
the
outcome
of
a
little
strategy
on
the
part
of
their
mother
mary
and
teddy
and
allan
and
gertrude
were
just
a
pair
of
steps
as
the
saying
goes
and
sometimes
the
little
on
the
fourth
floor
seemed
all
too
small
for
the
noisy
company
and
then
bennett
would
exclaim
and
as
though
the
most
novel
sort
of
an
idea
had
occurred
to
her
children
why
don
t
you
run
down
to
the
yard
and
have
a
talk
there
was
no
resisting
this
appeal
such
untold
delights
were
implied
in
bennett
s
tone
and
manner
and
the
children
seldom
failed
to
act
upon
the
advice
and
what
was
more
seldom
failed
to
light
upon
some
interesting
thing
to
talk
about
and
then
always
as
a
last
resort
some
one
could
tell
a
story
the
some
one
was
generally
teddy
for
he
had
the
wildest
imagination
and
could
upon
any
and
every
occasion
invent
most
thrilling
romances
which
were
quite
as
much
of
a
surprise
to
himself
as
to
his
hearers
and
so
the
children
had
come
to
love
their
perch
in
the
corner
of
the
city
yard
with
the
uncertain
shade
of
an
old
alanthus
flickering
over
them
in
summer
and
the
bright
sun
streaming
full
upon
them
in
its
leafless
winter
days
and
this
was
how
it
chanced
that
the
bennett
children
found
themselves
in
their
old
haunt
that
breezy
may
morning
and
were
easing
their
heavy
little
hearts
by
frankly
admitting
to
one
another
how
very
great
indeed
was
their
disappointment
better
so
i
think
wrinkles
come
earlier
and
plow
deeper
and
thoughts
are
apt
to
grow
bitter
and
morbid
when
one
broods
and
broods
and
will
not
take
hearts
near
and
dear
into
one
s
confidence
the
day
never
dawns
when
truly
brave
hearts
cry
out
for
pity
but
sympathy
is
a
sweet
and
blessed
thing
the
world
over
and
god
meant
not
only
that
we
should
have
it
but
that
if
need
be
we
should
reach
our
hands
and
grasp
it
there
was
one
little
bennett
however
who
did
not
share
in
the
general
depression
too
short
a
time
in
the
world
to
know
aught
of
its
joys
or
sorrows
baby
bennett
lay
comfortably
in
his
mother
s
lap
having
just
dropped
off
to
sleep
after
a
good
half
hour
of
rocking
bennett
who
had
herself
grown
drowsy
with
her
low
crooning
over
the
baby
glanced
first
at
the
bustling
little
clock
on
the
mantel
shelf
and
then
leaning
her
head
against
the
back
of
the
chair
closed
her
eyes
but
instead
of
falling
asleep
she
fell
to
thinking
and
then
her
face
grew
very
sad
and
tears
made
their
way
from
beneath
her
closed
eyelids
so
you
see
the
was
heavy
as
well
as
in
the
bennett
family
and
for
the
same
reason
it
was
not
because
they
were
not
learning
to
face
and
accept
the
thought
that
miss
julia
whom
they
so
dearly
loved
could
not
return
to
them
they
were
trying
to
be
as
brave
as
miss
julia
herself
would
have
had
them
but
this
was
the
day
the
very
day
that
they
were
all
to
have
started
and
they
could
not
seem
to
forget
it
for
a
moment
neither
could
somebody
else
and
soon
there
came
a
gentle
knock
at
bennett
s
door
come
in
she
answered
forgetting
the
tears
in
her
eyes
and
laying
the
baby
in
its
little
of
a
bed
she
turned
to
greet
the
newcomer
courage
had
mounted
the
four
flights
of
stairs
very
bravely
but
the
sight
of
the
tears
in
bennett
s
eyes
disarmed
her
and
sinking
into
the
nearest
chair
she
found
she
would
best
not
try
to
speak
for
a
moment
oh
i
m
so
sorry
miss
courage
that
you
should
have
seen
me
said
bennett
with
a
world
of
regret
in
her
voice
it
is
so
much
harder
for
you
than
for
anybody
but
this
was
the
day
you
know
almost
the
very
yes
i
know
courage
faltered
that
was
why
i
it
s
like
you
miss
courage
you
ve
miss
julia
s
own
thoughtfulness
but
i
m
thinking
it
will
be
easier
for
us
all
when
this
day
s
over
i
got
rid
of
the
trunk
last
week
it
seemed
to
make
us
all
so
disheartened
to
have
it
standing
you
didn
t
sell
it
did
you
no
indeed
i
did
not
for
it
may
be
the
children
will
have
a
chance
yet
some
day
for
a
bit
of
an
i
have
decided
they
are
all
to
have
it
yet
bennett
this
very
summer
and
just
as
miss
julia
planned
too
that
s
what
i
came
to
tell
you
if
you
will
trust
them
to
trust
you
oh
my
dear
but
it
would
be
too
much
care
for
those
young
shoulders
too
much
by
mrs
bennett
said
courage
so
earnestly
as
to
carry
conviction
i
thought
so
at
first
too
but
the
plan
has
grown
to
be
just
as
dear
to
me
as
it
was
to
miss
julia
and
now
if
you
do
not
let
me
carry
it
out
i
do
not
see
how
i
can
ever
live
through
this
first
then
indeed
i
will
let
you
and
then
she
added
slowly
and
with
an
accent
on
every
word
and
you
are
just
miss
julia
s
own
child
and
courage
thought
them
the
very
sweetest
words
she
had
ever
heard
or
ever
could
hear
again
may
i
tell
the
children
she
asked
eagerly
where
are
they
bennett
did
not
answer
i
believe
she
could
not
but
she
opened
the
window
and
courage
knew
that
meant
the
children
were
below
in
their
favourite
corner
oh
let
me
call
them
please
resting
one
hand
on
bennett
s
arm
and
leaning
far
out
over
the
sill
children
come
up
stairs
for
a
moment
i
have
something
to
tell
you
come
up
courage
hardly
knew
her
own
voice
it
rang
out
so
cheerily
oh
miss
courage
chorused
four
little
voices
only
this
time
the
sound
was
in
her
ears
as
well
as
in
her
heart
and
as
she
watched
the
children
tumble
from
the
horses
in
the
yard
way
down
below
her
a
smile
that
was
almost
merry
drove
the
shadows
from
her
face

joe
brought

standstill
that
they
might
more
fully
take
in

situation
don

you
think
i

joe
why
yes
honey
seems
ter
me
it
would
be
sort
of
frien
ly
and
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
he
took
brevet
by
the
arms
and
dropped
him
down
over
the
the
change
that
had
come
over
this
point
in
the
road
was
indeed
remarkable
a
little
house
that
had
remained
untenanted
for
years
in
the
midst
of
an
overgrown
enclosure
stood
this
bright
june
morning
with
every
door
and
window
open
to
the
air
and
sunshine
the
vines
which
had
half
hidden
it
from
view
had
already
been
cut
away
and
on
every
hand
were
signs
that
the
place
was
being
brought
into
liveable
shape
with
all
possible
expedition
no
one
was
in
sight
so
brevet
noiselessly
pushed
open
the
gate
and
making
his
way
to
the
little
front
porch
reached
upward
and
lifted
the
brass
knocker
of
the
open
door
the
unexpected
sound
instantly
brought
a
woman
from
some
room
in
the
rear
illustration
how
dy
said
brevet
instantly
put
at
his
ease
by
the
kindness
of
the
woman
s
face
what
did
you
say
dear
she
asked
with
a
puzzled
frown
i
said
how
dy
explained
brevet
wondering
that
the
woman
s
face
still
wore
the
puzzled
look
we
just
stopped
to
ask
who
was
coming
we
go
by
here
very
often
joe
and
i
pointing
to
the
cart
and
we
were
wondering
what
was
up
seeing
this
place
open
that
s
been
closed

it
can
t
be
that

self

not
set
so
far
back
from
the
road
but
that
he
could
hear
every
word
spoken
between
the
woman
and
brevet
why
did
you
know
miss
julia
she
asked
stepping
at
once
to
the
gate
with
brevet
following
close
behind
her
no

is
not
personally
but
i

dat

member
when

with
as
much
feeling
in
his
voice
as
though

captain
clambering
into
the
cart
and
then
joe
and
brevet
courteously
touched
their
caps
in
true
military
fashion
and
old
jenny
jogged
on
miss
did
she
say
asked
brevet
the
moment
they
were
out
of
hearing
just
as
joe
knew
he
would
yes
it
soun
like
dat
honey
but
some
day
we
must
make
inquiries
dere
mus
be
some
splanation
of
a
name
like
chapter
everybody
happy
it
is
strange
and
beautiful
thought
courage
as
she
moved
busily
about
her
room
putting
one
thing
and
another
into
a
trunk
that
stood
open
before
the
fireplace
strange
and
beautiful
how
difficulties
take
to
themselves
wings
when
you
once
make
up
your
mind
what
is
right
to
do
and
then
go
straight
ahead
and
do
miss
courage
said
a
young
coloured
girl
who
was
leaning
over
the
bed
trying
to
fold
a
black
dress
in
a
fashion
that
should
leave
no
creases
to
show
for
its
packing
i
felt
all
along
there
was
nothing
else
for
you
to
then
sylvia
why
did
you
not
say
so
courage
asked
a
little
sharply
you
knew
how
hard
it
was
for
me
to
come
to
any
decision
it
was
not
because
you
were
afraid
to
say
so
was
it
afraid
and
a
merry
look
shone
for
a
moment
in
sylvia
s
eyes
no
i
don
t
believe
i
ever
could
grow
afraid
of
the
little
girl
i
used
to
work
for
when
we
were
both
children
together
no
indeed
it
was
only
because
i
thought
you
ought
to
see
it
so
yourself
it
seemed
as
though
it
was
just
as
plain
a
duty
as
the
hand
before
your
face
and
i
felt
sure
you
would
come
to
it
as
you
have
if
we
only
gave
you
time
it
was
a
comfort
to
courage
to
feel
that
sylvia
so
thoroughly
understood
her
indeed
they
were
far
more
to
each
other
than
mistress
and
maid
they
were
true
friends
these
two
whose
only
home
for
a
while
had
been
larry
starr
s
brave
lighter
and
for
both
of
whom
he
had
cared
in
the
same
kind
fatherly
way
of
course
you
do
not
understand
about
larry
or
larry
s
lighter
unless
you
have
read
courage
but
then
on
the
other
hand
there
is
no
reason
why
you
need
to
understand
nor
was
sylvia
the
only
one
who
approved
of
what
courage
had
done
the
elversons
miss
julia
s
brother
and
his
wife
and
with
whom
courage
and
miss
julia
had
lived
were
as
glad
as
glad
could
be
to
have
courage
carry
out
miss
julia
s
plan
and
so
in
fact
was
everybody
who
saw
how
sad
and
lonely
courage
was
and
what
a
blessing
anything
that
would
occupy
her
thoughts
must
be
to
her
and
so
in
the
light
of
all
this
you
can
see
how
sad
it
would
have
been
if
courage
had
yielded
to
her
fears
and
persistently
turned
away
from
a
duty
in
very
truth
as
plain
as
the
hand
before
your
face
as
sylvia
had
put
it
but
courage
had
not
turned
away
nor
for
one
instant
wavered
from
the
moment
her
resolve
was
taken
and
now
at
last
the
day
for
the
start
had
dawned
the
little
bennetts
had
been
awake
at
sunrise
fancy
having
three
months
of
christmas
ahead
of
you
for
it
seemed
just
as
fine
as
that
to
them
it
was
a
wonder
they
had
slept
at
all
they
had
read
about
brooks
and
hills
and
valleys
and
woods
where
all
manner
of
beautiful
wild
things
were
growing
of
herds
of
cow
s
grazing
in
grassy
pastures
of
loads
of
hay
with
children
riding
atop
of
them
and
of
the
untold
delights
of
a
and
now
they
were
going
to
know
and
enjoy
every
one
of
these
delights
for
themselves
why
they
could
not
even
feel
sad
about
leaving
their
mother
and
indeed
she
was
as
radiant
as
they
at
the
thought
of
their
going
you
see
she
explained
to
them
i
shall
have
the
baby
for
company
and
such
a
beautiful
time
to
rest
and
your
father
and
i
will
take
a
sail
now
and
then
down
the
bay
or
go
to
the
park
for
the
day
in
the
very
warm
weather
and
then
it
is
going
to
be
such
a
comfort
to
have
your
father
home
for
two
whole
months
and
that
couldn
t
have
happened
either
you
know
if
you
had
not
been
going
away
for
the
the
children
s
father
captain
bennett
was
one
of
the
pilots
who
earn
their
living
by
bringing
the
great
ocean
steamers
into
the
harbour
and
often
he
would
be
aboard
the
at
sea
for
weeks
at
a
time
waiting
his
turn
to
take
the
helm
of
one
of
the
incoming
steamers
and
then
as
like
as
not
he
would
have
to
put
straight
to
sea
again
for
there
were
many
to
keep
and
there
was
need
for
every
dollar
but
the
captain
s
chance
for
a
vacation
had
come
with
the
children
s
he
could
afford
to
take
it
since
four
of
his
little
family
were
to
be
provided
for
for
the
entire
summer
and
so
every
one
was
happy
and
every
one
believed
that
somehow
miss
julia
must
know
and
be
so
glad
for
them
all
but
this
was
the
day
for
the
start
as
i
told
you
and
the
children
had
started
they
were
in
the
at
the
foot
of
cortlandt
street
where
courage
was
to
meet
them
and
here
she
is
exclaimed
mary
with
a
great
sigh
of
relief
being
the
first
to
espy
courage
coming
through
the
gate
of
the
and
doesn
t
she
look
lovely
mary
was
right
courage
did
look
lovely
as
with
sylvia
close
behind
her
she
walked
the
length
of
the
to
where
the
little
group
were
standing
other
people
thought
so
too
as
she
passed
and
watched
her
with
keenest
interest
her
stylish
black
dress
and
black
sailor
hat
were
wonderfully
becoming
and
the
face
that
had
been
so
pale
and
sad
was
flushed
with
pleasure
now
and
with
the
rather
uncomfortable
consciousness
that
she
and
her
little
party
could
scarcely
fail
to
be
the
observed
of
all
observers
bennett
was
there
of
course
to
see
them
off
and
the
baby
and
the
captain
and
it
must
be
confessed
that
the
eyes
of
both
father
and
mother
grew
a
little
misty
as
they
said
to
their
little
flock
the
girl
contingent
was
a
trifle
misty
too
but
the
baby
was
the
only
one
who
really
cried
outright
however
i
half
believe
that
was
because
he
wanted
a
banana
that
hung
in
a
fruit
stand
near
by
and
not
at
all
because
the
children
were
going
to
leave
him
some
babies
seem
to
have
so
very
little
feeling
but
now
it
was
time
to
go
aboard
the
boat
and
the
captain
and
bennett
saw
the
last
of
the
little
party
as
they
disappeared
within
the
cabin
and
then
in
fifteen
minutes
more
the
same
little
party
was
ranged
along
one
side
of
a
parlor
car
on
the
washington
limited
then
the
wheels
slowly
and
noiselessly
commenced
to
turn
and
they
were
really
off
all
of
the
little
party
s
hearts
thrilling
with
the
thought
and
all
sitting
up
as
prim
as
you
please
in
their
chairs
quite
overawed
with
the
magnificence
of
their
surroundings
and
the
unparalleled
importance
of
the
occasion
courage
very
much
amused
watched
them
for
a
few
moments
and
then
suggested
that
they
should
settle
themselves
for
the
journey
bags
were
stowed
away
in
the
racks
overhead
coats
and
hats
banished
to
coat
hooks
and
one
thing
and
another
properly
adjusted
until
at
last
four
little
pair
of
hands
having
placed
four
little
footstools
at
exactly
the
desired
angle
four
pair
of
russet
shoes
found
a
rather
conspicuously
atop
of
them
and
the
four
children
leaned
comfortably
back
in
the
large
upholstered
chairs
as
though
now
at
last
permanently
established
for
the
entire
length
of
the
journey
but
of
course
no
amount
of
adjusting
and
arranging
really
meant
anything
of
that
sort
or
that
they
could
be
able
to
sit
still
for
more
than
five
minutes
at
a
time
and
courage
and
sylvia
soon
had
to
put
their
wits
to
work
to
think
up
ways
of
keeping
the
restless
little
company
in
some
sort
of
order
but
fortunately
none
of
the
appeared
disturbed
thereby
on
the
contrary
they
seemed
very
much
interested
and
finally
a
handsome
old
gentleman
came
down
the
aisle
and
leaning
over
the
chair
in
which
courage
was
sitting
said
courteously
my
dear
young
lady
if
you
will
pardon
an
old
man
s
curiosity
and
do
not
for
any
reason
mind
telling
me
i
should
very
much
like
to
know
what
you
are
doing
and
where
you
are
going
with
this
little
family
and
i
am
very
glad
to
tell
you
answered
courage
cordially
for
since
that
summer
spent
with
larry
there
had
always
been
such
a
very
warm
corner
in
her
heart
for
all
old
people
and
teddy
who
was
sitting
next
to
courage
had
the
grace
to
offer
the
old
gentleman
a
chair
then
for
some
time
he
listened
intently
his
kind
old
face
glowing
with
pleasure
as
courage
told
him
all
about
the
children
and
finally
of
the
cosy
little
cottage
awaiting
their
coming
down
in
virginia
but
in
doing
all
this
courage
concluded
i
am
simply
carrying
out
the
plans
of
my
dearest
friend
miss
julia
oh
you
don
t
mean
it
the
old
gentleman
exclaimed
his
voice
trembling
i
knew
miss
everett
well
she
always
stopped
with
me
when
she
came
to
can
it
be
that
you
are
old
colonel
anderson
yes
i
am
colonel
anderson
and
i
suppose
i
am
old
he
added
smiling
and
can
it
be
you
are
young
miss
courage
of
whom
i
have
heard
so
often
yes
i
am
courage
but
you
will
excuse
me
won
t
you
for
speaking
as
i
did
i
only
had
happened
to
hear
miss
julia
courage
hesitated
oh
yes
dear
child
i
understand
perfectly
you
used
to
hear
miss
julia
speak
of
me
as
old
colonel
anderson
and
so
i
am
and
i
am
not
ashamed
of
it
either
although
i
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
tease
you
a
little
which
was
very
rude
of
me
but
now
can
it
be
that
it
is
to
miss
julia
s
estate
near
arlington
that
you
are
going
to
the
home
that
her
uncle
everett
left
her
when
she
was
just
a
little
slip
of
a
girl
years
before
the
war
yes
that
is
exactly
where
but
i
have
never
seen
well
you
will
love
it
when
you
do
it
is
the
dearest
little
spot
in
the
world
i
will
drive
out
some
day
and
take
luncheon
with
you
and
the
children
if
i
should
happen
to
have
an
invitation
i
could
tell
you
some
interesting
things
about
the
old
oh
will
you
come
exclaimed
mary
and
gertrude
in
one
breath
for
with
a
curiosity
as
pardonable
i
think
as
that
of
old
anderson
all
of
the
children
had
grouped
themselves
about
courage
and
had
listened
with
keenest
interest
to
every
word
spoken
and
so
one
more
happy
anticipation
was
added
to
the
many
with
which
their
happy
hearts
were
overflowing
at
last
the
train
steamed
into
washington
although
at
times
it
had
seemed
to
the
children
as
though
it
never
would
and
then
a
carriage
was
soon
secured
and
three
on
a
seat
the
little
party
crowded
into
it
and
they
were
off
for
their
eight
mile
drive
to
arlington
chapter
howdy
and
meantime
what
excitement
in
the
little
cottage
down
in
virginia
everything
was
in
readiness
and
everybody
was
on
the
tiptoe
of
expectation
everybody
meant
mary
duff
it
was
she
you
know
who
had
cared
for
little
courage
through
all
her
babyhood
and
who
had
been
sent
down
to
get
everything
in
order
and
besides
mary
duff
mary
ann
the
cook
old
joe
and
brevet
it
must
be
confessed
brevet
had
had
a
little
difficulty
in
winning
his
grandmother
s
consent
to
this
visit
but
he
had
been
able
to
meet
every
objection
with
such
convincing
arguments
that
he
had
come
off
victor
in
the
encounter
you
see
he
had
confidentially
explained
with
his
pretty
little
accent
i
is
a
perfec
stranger
to
them
now
i
know
but
then
everything
is
strange
to
them
down
here
so
don
t
you
s
pose
it
would
be
nice
for
me
to
be
right
there
waiting
at
the
gate
where
i
can
call
out
dy
just
so
soon
as
ever
they
come
in
sight
and
so
for
me
not
to
be
a
stranger
to
them
more
n
the
first
minute
and
have
them
find
there
are
folks
here
who
are
very
glad
to
know
them
right
from
the
start
besides
the
lady
mary
duff
was
her
name
told
me
she
just
knew
those
little
bennetts
would
love
to
see
me
and
that
she
would
surely
expect
me
down
for
and
so
succumbed
not
having
the
heart
to
nip
such
noble
hospitality
in
the
bud
and
at
two
o
clock
precisely
the
best
carriage
wheeled
up
to
the
door
and
mammy
and
brevet
were
quickly
stowed
away
within
it
to
say
nothing
of
a
basketful
of
good
things
covered
with
a
huge
napkin
of
fine
old
damask
but
who
is
mammy
you
ask
and
indeed
you
should
have
been
told
pages
ago
for
no
one
for
many
years
had
been
half
so
important
as
mammy
in
the
ellis
household
she
is
an
old
negro
woman
almost
as
old
as
joe
himself
and
when
on
the
first
of
january
president
lincoln
issued
the
proclamation
that
made
all
the
slaves
free
she
was
among
the
first
to
turn
her
back
upon
the
plantation
where
she
was
raised
and
make
her
way
to
washington
it
was
there
that
ellis
had
found
her
when
in
search
of
a
nurse
for
her
two
little
boys
and
from
that
day
to
this
she
has
been
the
faithful
worshipper
of
the
whole
ellis
family
now
in
her
old
age
her
one
and
only
duty
has
been
to
care
for
brevet
a
care
constantly
lessening
as
that
little
fellow
daily
proves
his
ability
to
look
out
more
and
more
for
himself
brevet
was
not
to
be
allowed
however
on
the
occasion
of
this
first
visit
to
their
new
neighbours
to
make
the
trip
alone
had
been
very
firm
about
that
somewhat
to
his
chagrin
and
so
if
the
truth
be
told
mammy
s
presence
in
the
comfortable
carriage
was
at
first
simply
tolerated
but
that
state
of
affairs
did
not
last
long
try
as
he
would
brevet
was
too
happy
at
heart
to
cherish
any
grievance
imaginary
or
otherwise
for
many
minutes
together
and
soon
he
and
mammy
were
chatting
away
in
the
merriest
fashion
and
the
old
nurse
was
looking
forward
to
the
unusual
excitement
of
the
day
with
quite
as
much
expectation
as
her
little
charge
of
seven
had
she
not
devoted
the
leisure
of
two
long
mornings
of
preparation
to
the
shelling
of
almonds
and
the
stoning
of
raisins
and
then
when
the
day
came
with
eager
trembling
hands
packed
all
the
good
things
away
in
the
great
roomy
hamper
that
seemed
now
to
look
at
her
so
complacently
from
the
opposite
seat
of
the
phaeton
yes
indeed
it
was
every
whit
as
glad
a
day
for
mammy
as
brevet
and
she
peered
out
from
the
carriage
just
as
anxiously
as
they
drove
up
to
the
gate
and
mary
duff
came
out
to
greet
them
but
mammy
had
something
to
say
before
making
any
motion
to
leave
the
carriage
are
you
quite
sure
miss
dat
dis
yere
little
pickaninny
of
ours
ain
t
gwine
to
be
in
any
one
s
way
or
nuffin
she
asked
bowing
a
to
mary
and
keeping
a
restraining
hand
upon
brevet
oh
perfectly
he
done
told
us
you
wanted
him
very
much
but
in
a
tone
as
though
what
brevet
done
told
them
was
sometimes
suspicioned
of
being
slightly
coloured
by
what
he
himself
would
like
to
do
notwithstanding
his
general
high
standard
of
truthfulness
brevet
is
perfectly
right
we
do
want
him
very
much
mary
answered
heartily
even
if
you
have
to
take
his
old
mammy
long
wid
him
kase
miss
lindy
wasn
t
quite
willin
to
low
him
ter
come
by
hisself
and
we
re
very
glad
to
see
you
mammy
mary
answered
cordially
and
so
the
last
of
mammy
s
scruples
which
were
not
as
real
as
mammy
herself
tried
to
think
them
were
put
to
rest
and
brevet
was
permitted
to
scramble
out
of
the
carriage
while
mary
duff
lent
a
hand
to
mammy
s
more
difficult
alighting
is
dere
ere
a
man
bout
could
lift
dis
yere
basket
ter
de
house
for
us
she
asked
looking
helplessly
up
to
the
hamper
kase
daniel
dere
has
instructions
from
de
missus
neber
to
leave
de
hosses
less
n
dere
ain
t
no
way
to
help
well
i
guess
dere
is
chuckled
a
familiar
voice
behind
her
back
and
mammy
turned
to
discover
joe
close
beside
her
well
i
klar
you
heah
she
exclaimed
why
it
seems
like
de
whole
county
turn
out
to
welcome
dese
yere
little
bennetts
seems
too
like
some
of
us
goin
to
be
in
de
way
sure
howsomever
some
on
us
don
take
up
so
much
room
as
oders
grunted
joe
surmising
and
quite
correctly
too
that
mammy
considered
his
presence
on
the
scene
something
wholly
unnecessary
and
undesirable
i
se
heah
to
help
wid
de
trunks
mammy
he
then
added
what
you
heah
to
help
wid
mammy
scorning
the
insinuation
turned
to
mary
duff
as
they
walked
up
the
path
you
know
honey
de
lord
ain
t
lef
no
choice
ter
most
on
us
as
ter
what
size
we
ll
be
but
pears
like
you
d
better
be
a
fat
ole
mammy
like
me
than
such
a
ole
bag
o
bones
as
joe
illustration
but
joe
by
that
time
was
depositing
his
basket
in
the
of
the
cottage
and
was
fortunately
quite
beyond
the
fire
of
this
personal
attack
mary
duff
was
naturally
much
amused
at
the
real
but
harmless
jealousy
of
these
old
coloured
folk
and
realised
for
perhaps
the
five
hundredth
time
what
children
we
all
are
be
race
and
nationality
what
they
may
meantime
brevet
had
taken
his
position
on
the
top
rail
of
the
gate
with
one
arm
around
a
slim
little
cedar
that
stood
guard
beside
it
may
i
stand
right
out
here
miss
duff
he
called
back
to
mary
so
as
to
see
them
a
long
way
off
bless
your
heart
yes
mary
answered
quite
certain
in
her
mind
that
since
courage
herself
was
a
little
girl
she
never
had
seen
such
a
dear
child
brevet
s
watch
was
a
brief
one
they
are
coming
hear
the
wheels
they
are
coming
he
cried
exultingly
with
almost
the
next
breath
in
just
two
minutes
more
they
really
and
brevet
was
calling
out
how
dy
how
dy
how
dy
at
the
top
of
his
strong
little
lungs
to
the
amazement
of
the
bennetts
who
had
never
heard
this
southern
abbreviation
of
the
northern
then
jumping
down
from
his
perch
he
ran
up
to
the
carriage
repeating
over
again
his
cordial
welcoming
how
how
dy
dear
little
stranger
replied
courage
waving
a
greeting
to
mary
and
who
are
you
i
would
like
to
know
i
m
howard
stanhope
ellis
but
that
s
not
what
you
re
to
call
me
i
have
another
name
it
s
the
name
they
give
but
he
did
not
finish
his
sentence
for
charming
little
fellow
though
he
was
he
could
not
be
allowed
to
monopolise
things
in
this
fashion
and
mary
gently
pushed
him
aside
to
get
him
out
of
her
way
and
so
here
you
are
at
last
she
said
joyously
welcome
home
miss
courage
how
are
you
sylvia
while
she
bent
down
with
a
cordial
kiss
for
each
friendly
little
bennett
meantime
courage
was
making
friends
with
brevet
and
a
moment
later
the
children
were
crowding
close
about
him
my
but
i
m
glad
to
see
you
all
he
exclaimed
with
an
emphasising
shake
of
his
head
and
i
think
i
know
who
s
who
too
i
believe
this
is
gertrude
laying
one
little
brown
hand
on
gertrude
s
sleeve
and
you
are
mary
because
mary
s
the
oldest
and
you
teddy
because
teddy
comes
next
and
you
you
are
brevet
had
learned
his
lesson
from
mary
duff
quite
literally
by
heart
and
altogether
vanquished
by
his
joyous
friendly
greeting
the
children
vied
with
each
other
in
giving
him
the
loudest
kiss
and
the
very
hardest
hug
but
from
that
first
moment
of
meeting
it
was
an
accepted
fact
that
allan
held
first
place
there
was
no
gainsaying
the
special
joyousness
of
his
and
you
you
are
the
boy
for
whom
he
had
hitherto
longed
in
vain
had
come
and
to
little
brevet
it
seemed
as
though
the
millennium
had
come
with
him
all
this
while
joe
and
mammy
barely
tolerating
each
other
s
presence
waited
respectfully
in
the
background
so
that
mary
had
a
chance
to
explain
who
they
were
as
courage
stood
in
the
path
delightedly
looking
up
at
the
dear
little
house
that
was
to
be
her
home
but
sylvia
had
already
made
their
acquaintance
after
paying
the
driver
and
making
sure
that
nothing
had
been
left
in
the
carriage
she
went
straight
toward
them
i
thought
i
should
find
some
of
my
own
people
down
here
in
virginia
she
said
cordially
extending
a
hand
to
each
as
she
spoke
but
i
did
not
expect
they
would
be
right
on
the
spot
the
very
first
moment
to
welcome
me
miss
duff
done
tol
us
bout
miss
sylvy
bein
of
de
party
said
joe
with
great
elegance
of
manner
while
mammy
looked
daggers
at
him
for
replying
to
a
remark
which
she
considered
addressed
chiefly
to
herself
it
was
queer
enough
the
attitude
of
these
two
oldtime
slaves
toward
each
other
and
yet
to
be
accounted
for
i
think
in
their
eagerness
to
be
of
use
to
those
whom
they
claimed
the
privilege
of
serving
and
each
was
conscious
by
a
subtle
intuition
of
a
determination
to
outwit
the
other
if
possible
in
this
regard
which
was
all
very
well
if
they
only
could
have
competed
in
the
right
sort
of
spirit
but
there
is
no
more
time
in
this
chapter
for
mammy
or
joe
nor
anything
else
for
that
matter
indeed
it
would
take
quite
a
chapter
of
itself
if
i
should
try
to
tell
you
of
the
unpacking
of
grandma
ellis
s
basket
and
then
of
the
children
s
merry
supper
but
it
seems
to
me
there
are
more
important
things
for
me
to
write
about
and
for
you
to
read
about
than
things
to
eat
and
of
how
the
children
ate
them
by
nine
o
clock
quiet
reigned
in
the
little
cottage
and
the
children
were
nestled
as
snug
in
their
beds
as
the
little
folk
in
the
night
before
joe
and
mammy
and
brevet
had
long
ago
gone
home
and
courage
and
mary
duff
were
sitting
together
in
the
little
while
sylvia
in
the
hall
just
outside
was
busy
arranging
the
books
they
had
brought
with
them
on
some
hanging
shelves
illustration
i
think
this
has
been
the
happiest
day
in
all
my
life
said
courage
i
have
simply
forgotten
everything
in
the
pleasure
of
those
and
then
sitting
down
at
the
little
cottage
piano
and
running
her
hands
for
a
few
moments
over
the
keys
she
sang
softly
for
all
the
saints
who
from
their
labour
rest
thy
name
o
jesus
be
forever
the
sweet
familiar
hymn
brought
sylvia
to
the
door
miss
courage
she
said
standing
with
her
arms
folded
behind
her
back
as
she
had
always
a
way
of
standing
when
deeply
interested
you
have
forgotten
yourself
and
your
sorrow
but
not
for
one
moment
have
you
really
forgotten
miss
julia
and
courage
knew
that
this
was
true
and
closed
the
little
piano
with
tears
in
her
eyes
and
a
wondrous
joy
and
peace
in
her
heart
chapter
arlington
before
the
war
no
sooner
were
our
little
new
yorkers
settled
in
their
pretty
summer
home
than
they
naturally
desired
that
it
should
have
a
name
and
after
much
discussion
according
to
the
bennett
custom
they
all
agreed
that
little
homespun
one
of
the
names
that
courage
had
suggested
seemed
to
fit
the
cosy
unpretentious
little
home
better
than
anything
else
that
had
been
thought
of
no
sooner
were
they
settled
either
before
they
became
friends
firm
and
fast
of
the
household
up
at
ellismere
it
needed
but
very
little
time
to
bring
that
about
because
everything
was
to
use
a
big
word
because
no
smaller
one
will
do
propitious
you
can
imagine
what
it
meant
to
courage
taking
up
her
home
in
a
new
land
and
with
cares
wholly
new
to
her
to
have
a
dear
old
lady
like
grandma
ellis
call
upon
her
as
she
did
the
very
first
morning
after
her
arrival
of
course
courage
had
to
explain
how
it
was
she
had
come
way
down
there
to
virginia
with
the
little
bennett
children
in
charge
indeed
almost
before
she
knew
it
and
in
answer
to
grandma
ellis
s
gentle
inquiries
she
had
told
her
all
there
was
to
tell
about
miss
julia
about
herself
and
mary
duff
and
sylvia
and
finally
as
always
with
any
new
friend
the
why
and
wherefore
of
her
own
unusual
name
the
tears
stood
in
grandma
ellis
s
eyes
many
times
during
the
narration
and
her
face
was
aglow
with
love
and
sympathy
and
admiration
as
courage
brought
her
story
to
a
close
illustration
and
now
my
dear
she
had
said
i
want
you
should
know
what
little
there
is
to
tell
about
we
live
just
three
miles
from
here
and
in
the
same
old
virginia
homestead
where
my
husband
was
born
we
means
my
son
harry
and
brevet
and
myself
brevet
as
you
already
know
perhaps
has
neither
father
nor
mother
his
mother
died
when
he
was
six
months
old
and
his
father
my
oldest
son
was
drowned
when
the
went
down
off
the
coast
of
spain
five
years
ago
we
are
doing
our
best
harry
and
i
to
make
up
to
brevet
for
his
great
loss
but
it
is
sad
that
the
little
fellow
should
only
know
the
love
of
an
old
grandmama
like
me
and
never
of
his
own
young
mother
but
i
do
not
want
to
burden
you
with
my
sorrows
dear
child
i
only
want
you
to
know
we
must
all
be
the
best
of
friends
the
whole
summer
through
it
seems
to
me
we
just
need
each
other
and
in
order
to
commence
right
you
must
all
come
and
spend
the
day
with
us
and
on
the
morrow
they
all
did
go
up
to
ellismere
mary
duff
and
sylvia
with
the
others
the
children
went
again
the
day
after
that
and
then
all
hands
from
ellismere
came
down
to
homespun
for
the
day
and
so
what
with
constant
coming
and
going
from
one
house
to
the
other
in
just
two
weeks
time
it
was
as
though
they
had
known
each
other
always
and
then
it
was
that
joe
arranged
with
courage
for
the
day
to
be
spent
at
arlington
the
ellis
s
will
all
come
joe
explained
mammy
wid
de
res
of
em
i
suppose
but
very
much
as
though
he
preferred
she
should
not
and
i
done
wish
de
colonel
could
be
persuaded
to
drive
out
from
washington
case
tween
us
we
knows
mos
dere
is
of
interest
happened
at
arlington
he
use
to
visit
at
de
big
house
when
general
lee
lived
in
it
fo
de
wah
an
i
was
a
slave
on
de
you
don
t
mean
colonel
anderson
do
you
joe
de
berry
same
well
then
of
course
he
ll
come
he
is
an
old
old
friend
of
miss
julia
s
i
met
him
on
the
train
when
we
came
down
and
he
asked
me
to
invite
him
out
some
time
and
so
courage
wrote
a
note
of
invitation
that
very
day
which
joe
with
his
own
hands
carried
into
washington
it
was
written
on
pretty
blue
paper
which
had
homespun
engraved
at
the
top
of
the
sheet
and
tiffany
s
mark
on
the
envelope
as
well
it
must
be
confessed
that
courage
had
a
little
extravagant
streak
in
her
that
is
she
loved
to
have
everything
just
about
as
nearly
right
as
she
could
sister
julia
had
encouraged
the
little
streak
knowing
the
peculiar
pleasure
that
the
reasonable
indulgence
of
a
refined
taste
brings
into
life
but
dear
she
had
often
said
to
courage
there
is
one
thing
to
look
out
for
and
that
is
that
the
more
you
gratify
your
own
taste
the
more
you
must
give
to
the
people
who
have
no
taste
at
all
or
very
little
of
anything
that
makes
life
enjoyable
all
of
which
good
advice
courage
had
taken
to
heart
and
remembered
but
extravagant
streak
or
no
the
stylish
little
blue
note
accomplished
its
purpose
for
at
precisely
nine
o
clock
the
next
morning
colonel
anderson
wheeled
up
at
joe
s
cabin
in
his
high
carriage
and
at
almost
the
same
moment
arrived
the
homespun
buckboard
with
its
load
of
eight
for
sylvia
and
mary
duff
were
to
be
in
as
many
good
times
as
possible
and
a
moment
later
grandma
ellis
harry
brevet
and
old
mammy
drove
upon
the
scene
now
how
would
we
best
manage
things
joe
asked
colonel
anderson
after
everybody
had
had
little
chat
with
everybody
else
and
luncheon
baskets
and
wraps
had
been
safely
stowed
away
in
joe
s
cabin
well
seems
ter
me
we
d
better
take
a
look
over
de
house
first
den
take
a
stroll
through
de
groun
s
an
come
back
to
de
shade
of
dat
ol
ches
nut
yonder
for
de
story
you
can
t
make
a
story
bery
interestin
when
you
hab
a
walkin
aujence
an
de
aujence
what
s
walkin
can
t
catch
on
ter
de
story
bery
well
it
was
easy
to
see
that
this
suggestion
was
a
wise
one
so
with
the
exception
of
grandma
ellis
and
mammy
for
whom
comfortable
were
at
once
placed
under
the
chestnut
tree
the
little
party
made
its
way
into
the
old
colonial
house
arlington
house
is
rather
a
cheerless
looking
place
now
i
admit
sighed
colonel
anderson
as
they
walked
through
the
large
empty
rooms
but
wait
till
we
have
the
story
and
we
ll
fill
it
full
yes
but
don
t
let
us
wait
any
longer
than
we
have
to
answered
courage
and
as
this
was
the
sentiment
of
the
entire
party
they
hurried
from
the
house
for
the
walk
that
was
to
follow
the
four
little
bennetts
kept
close
to
each
other
all
the
way
mary
the
eldest
leading
little
gertrude
by
the
hand
they
were
very
quiet
too
wondering
and
overawed
by
the
unbroken
lines
of
graves
on
every
side
i
wonder
if
teddy
and
i
will
have
to
go
to
a
war
when
we
grow
up
said
allan
at
last
half
under
his
breath
with
a
perceptible
little
shiver
and
as
though
barely
mustering
courage
to
speak
we
ll
go
if
there
is
a
war
i
can
tell
you
that
teddy
replied
rather
scornfully
then
we
ll
be
buried
here
i
suppose
and
allan
shook
his
head
hopelessly
as
though
standing
that
moment
at
the
foot
of
their
two
and
so
will
i
affirmed
brevet
who
had
kept
his
place
close
beside
his
favourite
allan
from
the
start
i
ll
speak
to
be
buried
right
by
both
of
you
too
just
as
though
i
was
one
of
your
family
and
brevet
stood
as
he
spoke
with
his
arms
folded
and
his
brows
knit
in
solemn
and
fashion
now
and
then
the
little
party
would
group
itself
around
colonel
anderson
as
he
read
the
inscription
from
some
monument
or
headstone
telling
of
the
valour
of
the
man
whose
grave
it
marked
and
often
of
the
brave
deed
dared
that
cost
the
hero
his
life
and
so
some
idea
was
gained
of
the
beauty
and
significance
of
the
great
soldier
cemetery
and
then
all
hurried
back
to
grandma
ellis
and
colonel
anderson
began
his
story
an
odd
assortment
of
chairs
had
been
brought
from
joe
s
cabin
for
the
and
the
children
were
scattered
about
on
shawls
and
carriage
rugs
on
the
ground
now
it
isn
t
easy
said
colonel
anderson
thoughtfully
to
know
just
where
to
den
i
ll
tell
you
said
joe
who
was
seated
at
the
colonel
s
elbow
dere
ain
t
no
such
proper
place
ter
begin
as
at
de
beginnin
tell
em
as
how
der
was
a
time
when
arlington
was
a
great
unbroken
forest
an
how
way
back
early
in
de
eighteen
hundreds
george
washington
parke
custis
came
by
de
lan
through
his
father
and
built
arlington
if
you
are
going
as
far
back
as
that
joe
you
ought
to
go
farther
and
tell
how
there
was
an
old
house
here
even
before
this
one
which
was
built
way
back
early
in
the
seventeen
hundreds
it
was
a
little
house
with
only
four
rooms
and
it
stood
down
yonder
near
the
bank
of
the
river
and
was
bought
with
the
land
by
john
custis
from
the
alexanders
john
custis
you
know
children
was
martha
washington
s
son
for
she
was
a
widow
with
two
children
when
she
married
general
washington
and
george
washington
parke
custis
who
lived
for
awhile
in
the
little
house
before
he
built
this
beautiful
big
one
was
her
grandson
he
was
a
fortunate
young
fellow
as
the
world
counts
being
fortunate
for
he
had
more
money
than
he
knew
what
to
do
with
as
soon
as
this
fine
house
was
completed
george
custis
was
married
and
brought
his
bride
to
his
new
home
where
for
the
next
fifty
years
they
lived
the
most
happy
and
contented
life
imaginable
they
had
one
daughter
a
very
beautiful
young
lady
as
i
myself
clearly
remember
for
my
birthday
and
her
fell
together
and
that
was
why
i
was
allowed
to
attend
the
wedding
my
mother
and
miss
mollie
s
mother
were
the
warmest
friends
but
i
was
only
a
boy
of
ten
and
would
have
been
left
at
home
i
think
but
for
the
coincidence
of
the
birthday
i
remember
my
mother
told
me
miss
custis
said
she
would
like
me
always
to
think
of
her
when
my
birthday
came
round
and
i
can
tell
you
children
i
always
do
even
though
i
am
an
old
man
and
have
started
in
the
an
so
do
i
chimed
in
joe
i
neber
done
think
of
one
without
de
oder
so
closely
are
dey
sociated
in
my
min
why
were
you
there
too
joe
asked
brevet
with
a
merry
little
twinkle
in
his
eyes
for
if
there
was
one
story
more
often
told
than
any
other
for
brevet
s
edification
it
was
the
story
of
miss
mary
custis
s
wedding
sho
as
yo
born
honey
quite
overlooking
brevet
s
insinuation
in
his
absorbing
interest
in
the
subject
it
was
a
bery
busy
day
for
me
de
day
miss
mollie
was
how
ole
was
you
joe
bout
dat
time
asked
mammy
her
old
eyes
with
mischief
as
well
as
brevet
s
for
joe
s
age
as
every
one
knew
was
a
mere
matter
of
guesswork
so
careful
was
he
that
no
one
should
ever
come
to
a
knowledge
of
the
same
seems
ter
me
dat
question
ain
t
no
wise
relavent
replied
joe
bristling
up
a
little
but
de
colonel
and
i
warn
t
so
bery
far
apart
when
we
was
why
were
you
friends
then
asked
allan
bennett
well
that
day
made
us
friends
answered
colonel
anderson
and
this
was
the
way
it
happened
everything
was
ready
for
the
wedding
as
many
of
the
guests
as
it
would
hold
were
assembled
in
the
the
room
on
the
left
of
the
front
door
there
as
you
go
in
but
the
clergyman
had
not
arrived
then
it
was
that
custis
beginning
to
grow
nervous
called
to
joe
there
who
stood
on
the
porch
as
fine
as
silk
in
his
best
clothes
and
white
cotton
gloves
ready
to
open
the
carriage
doors
for
the
guests
as
they
arrived
joe
called
custis
run
down
the
road
and
see
if
you
see
a
sign
of
a
carriage
anywhere
in
sight
and
children
what
do
you
suppose
joe
did
well
he
just
stood
stock
still
looking
down
at
his
bright
polished
boots
and
he
never
budged
an
it
s
de
truf
said
joe
shaking
his
head
regretfully
for
the
children
were
looking
to
him
for
confirmation
of
the
story
you
see
the
boots
were
very
shiny
continued
the
colonel
in
a
tone
of
apology
for
joe
and
the
roads
were
very
very
muddy
so
that
he
just
couldn
t
bring
himself
to
do
it
fortunately
for
joe
i
imagine
custis
had
not
waited
to
see
him
start
taking
for
granted
of
course
that
he
would
obey
at
once
and
then
what
did
i
do
but
spring
down
the
steps
and
run
on
joe
s
errand
for
him
only
too
thankful
if
i
could
do
anything
to
prove
my
gratitude
for
being
allowed
to
be
present
at
that
to
me
greatest
of
occasions
i
had
to
wait
less
than
five
minutes
before
i
discovered
the
open
chaise
which
had
been
sent
into
washington
to
bring
the
dominie
tearing
up
the
road
they
re
coming
they
ll
be
here
in
a
minute
i
called
hurrying
back
to
joe
and
then
he
rushed
away
in
his
new
shiny
boots
and
delivered
my
message
to
custis
pretending
as
the
rogue
confessed
to
me
afterward
to
be
quite
out
of
breath
from
the
haste
with
which
he
had
come
and
then
in
the
next
moment
meade
for
that
was
the
clergyman
s
name
was
really
there
but
he
came
in
at
the
back
door
and
slipped
upstairs
as
quickly
as
he
could
followed
by
joe
and
myself
you
see
he
had
driven
right
into
the
heart
of
a
heavy
thunder
shower
just
outside
of
washington
and
was
drenched
to
the
skin
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
that
he
must
make
a
change
of
clothing
as
quickly
as
he
could
so
joe
who
knew
where
custis
kept
his
clothes
ran
hither
and
thither
bringing
one
article
after
another
and
i
helped
the
minister
into
them
but
my
how
he
did
look
custis
was
short
and
stout
and
meade
was
tall
and
thin
and
i
didn
t
see
how
any
one
could
keep
their
faces
straight
with
such
a
guy
of
a
minister
they
couldn
t
have
done
it
either
if
they
had
seen
how
he
looked
could
they
joe
no
colonel
not
for
a
minute
chuckled
joe
but
why
didn
t
they
see
questioned
eager
little
allan
why
because
of
course
he
had
brought
his
gown
with
him
and
it
covered
him
all
up
for
brevet
able
to
anticipate
much
of
the
familiar
story
was
glad
to
have
a
hand
in
its
telling
i
wish
you
could
know
how
the
house
looked
in
those
days
said
the
colonel
with
a
sigh
of
regret
echoed
by
a
much
louder
and
deeper
sigh
on
the
part
of
joe
it
was
full
of
the
most
beautiful
things
there
was
a
magnificent
array
of
old
family
portraits
among
them
two
or
three
of
george
and
martha
washington
then
there
was
a
marvelous
old
sideboard
that
held
many
beautiful
things
that
had
belonged
to
washington
i
remember
in
particular
some
great
silver
candlesticks
with
snuffers
and
extinguishers
and
silver
and
some
exquisite
painted
china
part
of
a
set
that
had
been
given
to
washington
by
the
society
of
the
i
do
not
think
you
have
told
the
children
interrupted
grandma
ellis
who
it
was
that
miss
custis
can
that
be
possible
provoked
that
he
should
have
left
out
anything
so
important
why
it
was
general
robert
lee
i
m
afraid
we
don
t
know
who
general
lee
was
said
mary
bennett
blushing
a
little
and
then
she
added
quickly
you
see
we
live
so
far
away
from
where
the
war
was
fought
for
brevet
s
undisguised
look
of
astonishment
was
really
quite
paralysing
we
only
know
what
we
have
learnt
at
school
teddy
further
explained
and
we
don
t
remember
so
very
much
of
why
general
lee
said
brevet
earnestly
feeling
that
he
must
come
personally
to
the
rescue
of
such
dense
ignorance
was
the
greatest
general
they
had
down
south
he
would
have
whipped
us
yankees
if
any
one
he
was
a
fine
man
though
a
fine
man
said
joe
solemnly
he
and
miss
mary
lived
right
on
here
at
arlington
after
dey
was
married
and
dere
wasn
t
a
slave
of
us
on
de
place
who
wouldn
t
hab
let
lieutenant
lee
walk
right
ober
us
if
he
d
wanted
to
so
den
when
custis
died
in
and
lieutenant
lee
done
come
to
be
de
haid
of
de
house
it
was
changin
one
good
master
for
was
joe
a
slave
asked
allan
drawing
himself
up
to
mammy
s
knees
near
whom
he
happened
to
be
sitting
and
speaking
in
an
whisper
why
yes
honey
joe
was
born
in
a
cabin
nex
where
he
lives
an
we
was
all
slaves
down
here
fo
de
wah
but
de
coloured
folks
here
at
arlington
was
always
treated
ver
han
some
i
wasn
t
so
fortunate
honey
i
belonged
down
to
a
plantation
in
georgia
where
de
missus
was
kind
but
where
our
master
treated
us
des
like
cattle
an
i
had
my
only
chile
sold
away
from
me
when
she
wasn
t
no
mo
den
fo
teen
or
fifteen
an
i
don
know
ter
this
day
whether
she
be
livin
or
oh
mammy
was
all
allan
could
say
in
reply
but
his
little
face
looked
worlds
of
sympathy
meanwhile
joe
and
colonel
anderson
between
them
went
on
with
the
story
of
arlington
now
one
and
now
the
other
taking
up
its
thread
joe
told
of
the
many
cosy
cabins
at
that
time
dotted
about
the
place
in
which
the
slaves
lived
and
of
their
happy
life
on
a
plantation
where
they
all
felt
as
though
they
were
part
of
the
household
and
took
as
great
pride
and
pleasure
as
the
master
himself
in
everything
belonging
to
it
he
described
too
to
the
great
delight
of
the
children
the
wild
excitement
of
the
autumn
hunting
parties
when
custis
and
a
whole
houseful
of
guests
would
start
off
at
sunrise
coming
home
at
night
with
their
full
to
a
banquet
in
the
house
and
an
evening
of
unbounded
fun
and
merri
ment
the
colonel
told
about
the
house
itself
for
from
the
time
he
became
a
young
man
until
the
day
when
about
to
take
command
of
a
washington
regiment
he
came
to
say
goodbye
to
lieutenant
lee
he
had
been
a
constant
visitor
there
he
told
of
the
luxury
and
comfort
of
the
delightful
home
now
so
bare
and
desolate
of
the
pretty
in
the
right
wing
set
apart
for
custis
and
miss
mary
of
the
cosy
library
in
the
left
wing
and
then
of
the
pictures
painted
on
the
walls
by
custis
the
pictures
represented
five
of
the
battles
of
the
revolution
and
washington
was
the
central
figure
in
them
all
there
is
just
a
trace
of
some
of
his
work
left
now
on
the
rear
entrance
of
the
wide
hall
but
colonel
anderson
admitted
they
could
never
have
been
considered
very
fine
rather
detracting
than
adding
to
the
other
beautiful
finishings
of
the
house
but
what
became
of
all
the
beautiful
things
and
how
did
the
place
ever
happen
to
become
a
national
cemetery
asked
courage
in
one
of
the
pauses
when
both
joe
and
the
colonel
seemed
to
be
casting
about
in
their
minds
for
what
would
best
be
told
next
she
had
listened
as
intently
as
any
of
the
children
to
the
whole
narrative
and
was
every
whit
as
much
interested
well
it
seems
to
me
that
is
almost
a
story
in
itself
colonel
anderson
answered
and
that
we
would
better
have
out
the
luncheon
baskets
and
take
a
bit
of
even
the
children
agreed
but
at
first
to
this
interruption
but
the
avidity
with
which
they
afterward
settled
down
to
sandwiches
and
sponge
cake
showed
that
they
really
had
minds
not
above
the
physical
demands
of
life
illustration
chapter
arlington
afterward
miss
sylvy
asked
joe
rather
solemnly
would
you
be
so
kin
as
ter
tell
me
whar
you
hail
from
do
you
mean
where
i
was
born
joe
nodded
well
i
m
very
sorry
but
i
can
t
tell
you
and
the
colour
surged
perceptibly
under
her
dark
skin
h
m
said
joe
pressing
his
lower
lip
over
the
upper
one
as
he
had
a
habit
of
doing
when
he
considered
any
matter
required
careful
thought
then
after
a
pause
well
your
las
name
miss
sylvy
will
you
tell
me
dat
i
don
rightly
remember
eber
to
have
heard
sylvester
joe
but
it
s
a
name
i
chose
for
myself
i
do
not
know
what
name
i
was
born
why
however
miss
sylvy
did
dat
happen
and
joe
showed
such
deep
and
tender
interest
that
sylvia
who
cared
to
talk
on
the
subject
with
very
few
gladly
entered
into
a
full
explanation
she
told
him
as
she
had
told
courage
that
summer
night
so
many
years
before
on
larry
s
lighter
how
she
had
found
herself
landed
in
the
orphan
asylum
with
no
name
as
far
as
any
one
knew
excepting
just
sylvia
and
how
she
had
named
herself
sylvester
after
one
of
the
ladies
who
came
to
the
asylum
to
teach
and
then
she
continued
giving
a
brief
outline
of
her
life
since
that
time
all
of
which
proved
most
absorbing
to
joe
because
with
the
telling
of
sylvia
s
story
he
learnt
so
much
of
interest
about
miss
courage
as
well
but
honey
he
asked
at
the
end
of
the
story
with
a
sigh
as
of
one
who
has
listened
with
an
intentness
bordering
upon
fatigue
who
put
you
in
dat
sylum
some
one
just
left
me
at
the
asylum
at
night
with
a
card
pinned
on
to
my
dress
with
sylvia
written
on
it
and
saying
that
i
had
neither
father
nor
mother
and
then
ran
away
in
the
darkness
but
i
don
t
believe
any
one
related
to
me
would
have
treated
me
like
that
i
would
rather
you
would
not
say
anything
about
all
this
joe
it
is
only
because
you
are
one
of
my
own
people
and
seem
so
kind
and
interested
that
i
have
told
thank
you
bery
much
for
de
confidence
miss
sylvy
for
my
ole
heart
went
right
out
to
you
from
de
day
you
done
come
walkin
up
de
path
at
little
homespun
but
i
ll
keep
it
safe
miss
sylvy
never
you
joe
and
sylvia
had
been
busy
washing
dishes
and
clearing
up
after
the
luncheon
and
it
was
when
their
work
was
finished
and
they
were
waiting
under
the
chestnut
tree
for
the
others
to
come
back
that
they
had
had
their
little
talk
it
reached
its
natural
conclusion
just
as
colonel
anderson
came
strolling
up
from
the
river
blowing
a
shrill
whistle
between
two
fingers
the
signal
previously
agreed
upon
to
call
the
children
together
now
do
you
know
he
said
when
the
little
company
had
bestowed
itself
in
much
the
same
fashion
as
in
the
morning
i
have
an
idea
that
you
will
have
to
let
joe
and
me
do
all
the
talking
now
we
have
only
a
short
afternoon
before
us
and
there
is
a
great
deal
to
no
one
looked
as
though
that
would
be
the
least
hardship
and
joe
explained
that
he
himself
would
rather
listen
than
talk
less
n
de
colonel
disremembered
somethin
very
likely
as
not
i
shall
joe
but
it
seems
the
point
at
which
to
commence
this
afternoon
is
with
general
lee
at
the
time
that
he
married
miss
mollie
custis
he
was
a
lieutenant
in
the
united
states
army
but
he
had
gradu
ated
at
the
head
of
his
class
at
west
point
only
two
years
before
after
he
was
married
as
you
know
he
made
his
home
at
arlington
but
he
had
to
be
away
from
it
much
of
the
time
because
of
his
duties
in
the
army
he
was
a
fine
fellow
i
can
tell
you
and
held
one
responsible
position
after
another
he
was
right
in
the
thick
of
our
war
with
mexico
and
won
rapid
promotion
for
his
courage
and
daring
after
a
brilliant
charge
at
chapultepec
when
he
was
severely
wounded
he
was
made
a
by
general
scott
it
seemed
after
that
as
though
he
was
everywhere
where
a
brave
fearless
man
was
needed
he
was
in
command
in
texas
when
the
indians
were
attacking
the
settlers
there
and
was
in
many
a
bloody
engagement
later
on
he
was
the
commanding
officer
when
the
house
was
charged
at
harper
s
ferry
where
john
brown
had
taken
refuge
i
wish
there
was
time
children
to
stop
and
tell
you
about
john
brown
you
know
the
old
song
about
john
brown
s
body
lies
a
mouldering
in
the
grave
but
his
soul
goes
marching
get
joe
here
to
sing
it
for
you
some
day
if
you
don
t
well
you
see
by
all
this
that
general
lee
had
done
a
great
deal
for
his
country
but
there
came
a
day
when
he
felt
it
his
duty
to
turn
against
it
that
is
to
take
up
arms
against
the
united
states
you
all
know
how
the
great
civil
war
finally
came
about
how
the
northern
states
thought
the
southern
states
should
not
hold
slaves
and
how
the
southern
states
thought
they
had
the
right
to
decide
whether
they
should
or
not
without
any
interference
from
the
north
and
so
banded
themselves
together
and
said
they
would
secede
from
the
united
states
and
form
a
confederacy
of
their
own
this
virginia
whose
air
we
are
breathing
this
minute
was
one
of
those
states
and
was
general
lee
s
native
state
as
well
and
when
the
time
came
to
choose
between
his
state
and
his
country
he
decided
to
side
with
the
confederacy
then
of
course
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
but
to
resign
from
the
united
states
army
he
sent
his
letter
of
resignation
to
general
scott
on
the
of
april
and
then
at
once
left
arlington
with
his
wife
and
children
for
it
was
quite
too
near
to
washington
for
him
to
stay
now
that
he
had
taken
a
stand
against
the
government
and
the
very
next
day
he
was
made
of
the
army
in
virginia
a
few
days
before
this
that
is
on
the
fifteenth
of
april
president
lincoln
had
called
for
thousand
volunteers
and
three
days
after
the
lees
had
left
the
great
army
of
the
north
came
pouring
into
washington
and
all
the
country
round
about
crackled
among
the
oaks
at
arlington
and
the
house
itself
was
taken
possession
of
by
the
officers
when
the
troops
first
arrived
at
arlington
they
tramped
through
the
deserted
rooms
remaining
just
as
the
lees
had
left
them
and
concluding
that
all
s
fair
in
love
and
war
they
simply
helped
themselves
to
the
forsaken
treasures
oh
but
dose
were
drefful
days
said
joe
as
though
he
must
give
vent
to
the
thoughts
colonel
anderson
s
words
had
stirred
i
neber
can
forgive
dose
union
soldiers
neber
seems
as
dough
dey
might
done
have
respect
for
a
gentleman
s
place
but
not
a
bit
of
it
seemed
as
dough
dey
could
not
be
spiteful
nuff
gainst
de
general
des
fancy
seein
things
dat
had
belonged
to
washington
himself
carried
out
of
de
house
and
sol
in
de
streets
up
dere
in
de
city
of
washington
and
some
of
de
negroes
shame
on
em
ran
away
with
things
an
sol
em
for
more
money
dan
dey
themselves
would
have
sol
for
fo
de
wah
oh
it
was
pitiful
to
see
the
flower
beds
and
lawns
tramped
over
as
dough
dey
had
been
so
much
rubbish
and
it
wa
n
t
long
befo
de
smooth
green
terraces
were
just
ragged
you
d
have
thought
i
d
have
gone
away
wouldn
t
you
but
i
couldn
t
bring
my
self
to
leave
de
ole
place
until
i
listed
an
went
down
to
alabama
wid
a
coloured
regiment
dere
colonel
i
done
interrupt
you
didn
t
i
but
really
i
was
des
thinkin
aloud
more
dan
talkin
for
i
des
can
t
keep
my
thoughts
to
myself
when
i
grows
stracted
over
de
troublousness
of
dose
i
don
t
blame
you
joe
i
don
t
blame
you
said
colonel
anderson
but
as
for
me
i
was
feeling
pretty
hot
against
general
lee
those
days
i
didn
t
see
how
he
could
make
up
his
mind
to
regularly
take
up
arms
against
his
country
and
i
have
an
idea
that
i
felt
for
awhile
that
he
was
treated
no
worse
than
he
deserved
but
that
s
all
bygones
now
as
well
as
the
dear
old
arlington
home
that
will
never
be
a
home
again
you
see
almost
at
the
commencement
of
the
war
children
washington
with
all
the
country
immediately
about
became
the
hospital
centre
and
soon
a
surgeon
s
staff
was
quartered
in
the
house
yonder
in
addition
to
the
officers
already
there
and
at
the
same
time
long
canvas
shelters
were
constructed
in
those
woods
to
which
the
poor
sick
and
wounded
soldiers
were
brought
from
camp
and
battlefield
and
sadly
enough
many
of
them
died
here
at
first
all
who
died
were
taken
to
the
soldiers
home
cemetery
on
the
other
side
of
washington
to
be
buried
but
the
day
came
as
you
know
when
this
very
place
was
turned
into
a
cemetery
and
this
was
how
it
came
about
one
afternoon
as
president
lincoln
was
starting
for
his
usual
drive
which
seemed
to
be
the
only
way
by
which
he
could
gain
any
relief
from
the
burdens
of
that
anxious
time
he
met
general
meigs
who
was
general
then
of
the
united
states
army
walking
in
the
white
house
grounds
noticing
how
tired
and
worn
out
the
general
looked
the
president
invited
him
to
drive
with
him
and
general
meigs
accepted
it
was
the
president
s
purpose
to
drive
out
to
arlington
and
when
they
reached
there
the
president
started
off
for
a
quiet
stroll
but
general
meigs
whose
thoughts
were
very
busy
just
then
as
to
what
should
be
done
with
the
poor
soldiers
dying
in
such
numbers
in
and
about
washington
was
soon
deep
in
conference
with
the
surgeons
in
charge
you
see
there
would
soon
have
been
no
more
room
in
other
cemeteries
and
it
was
for
the
general
to
decide
what
was
to
be
done
in
the
matter
now
they
say
that
general
meigs
indulged
in
very
bitter
feelings
toward
his
old
friend
general
lee
and
that
when
he
rejoined
the
president
he
said
lee
shall
never
return
to
arlington
no
matter
what
the
issue
of
the
war
may
be
feeling
evidently
that
he
should
be
fully
punished
in
any
case
for
the
stand
he
had
taken
just
at
that
moment
a
sad
little
procession
came
that
way
the
bodies
of
several
poor
fellows
who
had
died
in
the
hospital
tents
were
being
carried
on
canvas
stretchers
to
a
spot
from
whence
they
could
be
taken
to
the
soldiers
home
cemetery
how
many
men
are
awaiting
burial
asked
general
meigs
of
the
sergeant
in
charge
of
the
squad
altogether
a
dozen
sir
the
sergeant
answered
bury
them
there
ordered
the
general
pointing
to
a
low
terrace
bordering
the
but
did
general
meigs
have
any
right
to
turn
general
lee
s
place
into
a
cemetery
asked
courage
a
little
warmly
feeling
that
an
interruption
was
excusable
under
the
circumstances
to
be
fair
always
if
possible
to
everybody
was
a
working
principle
with
courage
and
this
proceeding
of
general
meigs
s
did
not
seem
to
her
quite
fair
yes
i
think
he
had
a
perfect
right
miss
courage
in
time
of
war
the
government
certainly
has
a
right
to
take
possession
if
necessary
of
property
belonging
to
any
one
in
open
rebellion
against
it
and
besides
five
months
before
arlington
was
converted
into
a
cemetery
the
place
had
been
put
up
at
public
sale
and
bought
by
the
government
it
was
not
i
believe
until
however
that
the
lees
received
any
money
for
the
estate
and
that
i
admit
does
not
seem
fair
at
all
and
there
is
another
right
of
which
i
am
certain
and
that
is
that
the
brave
fellows
whose
bodies
rest
in
these
graves
had
a
right
to
the
most
beautiful
spot
anywhere
in
these
united
states
of
ours
for
their
last
no
i
think
it
was
fitting
that
arlington
should
become
one
of
our
national
cemeteries
and
i
believe
even
joe
yonder
thinks
so
yes
i
do
colonel
anderson
joe
answered
solemnly
much
as
i
love
general
lee
i
can
t
forget
what
de
war
cos
de
country
in
de
loss
of
human
life
and
general
lee
done
took
a
great
sponsibility
pon
him
when
he
help
de
war
on
by
takin
command
of
de
southern
troops
yes
i
m
glad
dat
de
fine
ole
place
has
been
pressed
into
de
service
of
de
country
in
des
de
way
it
has
colonel
anderson
s
question
put
to
joe
and
joe
s
reply
seemed
to
loosen
the
tongues
of
the
little
company
almost
every
one
from
brevet
up
had
some
question
or
other
to
ask
of
the
colonel
and
he
was
quite
willing
that
they
should
for
they
had
all
listened
so
atten
tively
that
the
story
had
been
told
more
quickly
than
either
joe
or
the
colonel
had
thought
possible
and
now
children
said
brevet
with
the
air
of
a
little
grandfather
do
you
wonder
that
i
love
to
come
and
spend
the
day
with
joe
why
there
isn
t
a
minute
when
i
m
here
that
he
isn
t
telling
me
something
bout
before
the
war
or
since
the
war
and
when
we
go
back
to
the
cabin
and
joe
makes
the
and
broils
a
chicken
for
luncheon
and
i
get
the
china
down
from
the
cupboard
and
set
the
table
with
both
of
us
talking
most
interesting
all
the
time
and
the
smell
of
the
cooking
just
filling
all
the
cabin
well
there
isn
t
ever
such
a
happy
time
is
there
joe
brevet
had
made
his
way
to
joe
s
side
as
he
spoke
and
reaching
up
put
one
chubby
little
arm
around
his
neck
no
bless
yo
little
white
heart
dere
never
is
quite
such
a
happy
time
and
joe
drew
the
little
fellow
into
his
lap
and
held
him
close
as
though
he
would
love
to
keep
him
there
forever
is
being
in
the
cabin
and
having
joe
cook
the
and
the
chicken
nicer
than
having
luncheon
out
here
in
the
grass
like
this
asked
allan
bennett
a
whole
world
of
envy
in
his
tone
a
heap
nicer
was
brevet
s
not
uncertain
reply
do
you
really
t
ink
so
honey
asked
joe
smiling
from
ear
to
ear
well
den
all
you
little
bennetts
is
invited
on
de
spot
to
take
fo
th
of

an
de
colonel

preparations
strikes
me
we
might
hab
a
good
time
sure
everybody
accepted
joe
s
invitation
with
alacrity
and
there
could
not
have
been
a
happier
ending
to
a
perfect
day
than
to
have
just
such
another
perfect
day
planned
for
at
its
close
it
simply
took
all
the
bitterness
out
of
the
parting
that
followed
soon
after
miss
lindy
whispered
joe
importantly
as
he
helped
grandma
ellis
into
the
carriage
i
spects
you
and
mars
harry
for
de
fo
th
of
july
dinner
but
as
dere
won
t
be
no
room
for
mammy
i
didn
t
make
no
public
mention
of
your
two
names
seemed
as
dough
it
might
make
her
feel
a
bit
uncomfortable
if
she
was
de
only
one
not
mentioned
but
you
understan
miss
lindy
de
cabin
am
small
an
mammy
large
an
putting
his
hand
to
his
mouth
and
speaking
in
a
still
lower
whisper
seems
like
mammy
gettin
too
old
to
be
of
much
use
to
anybody
you
un
erstan
miss
lindy
oh
yes
i
understand
perfectly
grandma
ellis
answered
very
much
amused
and
i
ll
make
it
all
right
with
but
from
grandma
ellis
s
point
of
view
mammy
did
not
seem
to
be
growing
old
one
whit
more
rapidly
than
old
joe
himself
chapter
to
save
brevet
between
one
happy
time
and
another
the
summer
passed
on
at
little
homespun
not
that
there
was
not
occasionally
an
unhappy
time
if
everything
had
moved
perfectly
smoothly
for
three
whole
months
together
in
a
house
where
there
were
four
irrepressible
children
with
many
of
the
faults
common
to
the
average
child
the
world
over
it
simply
would
have
been
a
miracle
outright
no
indeed
there
were
times
now
and
then
when
courage
quite
lost
her
patience
and
would
have
liked
to
box
and
ship
those
four
little
bennetts
straight
back
to
their
mother
and
there
were
days
when
even
mary
duff
lost
her
patience
completely
and
declared
she
would
chastise
the
first
one
of
them
that
dared
to
cross
the
threshold
of
the
kitchen
but
then
to
be
quite
fair
i
have
more
than
a
glimmering
notion
that
courage
and
mary
duff
had
their
naughty
moods
too
as
well
as
the
children
you
can
t
feel
perfectly
right
you
know
and
always
behave
just
as
you
should
every
minute
simply
because
you
happen
to
be
grown
up
it
would
be
very
fine
if
you
could
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
with
both
and
children
trying
hard
to
get
the
best
of
the
naughty
moods
will
in
time
accomplish
wonders
but
taken
as
a
whole
the
unhappy
times
at
homespun
were
nothing
more
than
motes
in
the
homespun
sunshine
most
of
the
time
merry
happy
voices
rang
through
and
about
the
house
from
dawn
till
sunset
peals
of
happy
laughter
that
made
any
one
laugh
who
heard
them
echoed
everywhere
bits
of
childish
song
floated
down
stairs
and
up
stairs
or
came
in
at
the
open
windows
i
se
a
little
alabama
coon
always
the
burden
of
the
refrain
when
brevet
was
down
for
the
day
then
toward
twilight
or
more
often
a
little
later
when
it
had
really
grown
quite
dark
the
same
dear
childish
voices
blended
in
a
sweet
evening
hymn
would
float
out
at
the
open
windows
and
the
little
people
whose
whole
minds
had
been
given
to
play
the
long
summer
day
through
would
quiet
down
and
then
go
contentedly
off
to
bed
their
childish
hearts
full
of
a
sweet
peace
that
they
hardly
understood
and
which
was
not
strange
at
all
for
it
was
simply
the
peace
that
passeth
all
but
not
all
the
days
by
any
manner
of
means
were
spent
in
or
about
little
homespun
joe
s
fourth
of
july
dinner
had
been
a
great
success
and
there
had
followed
several
excursions
carefully
planned
in
all
their
details
by
uncle
harry
and
every
one
of
them
voted
a
great
success
the
fall
that
had
broken
uncle
harry
s
arm
had
proved
a
veritable
windfall
for
the
children
if
a
windfall
means
something
very
pleasant
that
comes
in
your
way
quite
by
accident
like
apples
strewn
by
the
wind
unexpectedly
at
your
feet
it
had
not
been
altogether
an
unpleasant
experience
for
uncle
harry
either
notwithstanding
though
it
was
now
late
in
august
the
arm
was
still
in
a
sling
twice
it
had
had
to
be
reset
and
that
had
of
course
been
very
trying
and
yet
but
for
that
arm
he
would
have
been
delving
away
the
whole
summer
through
in
a
hot
office
up
at
washington
and
the
children
without
knowing
of
course
what
they
were
missing
would
in
fact
have
foregone
half
the
delight
of
the
summer
in
uncle
harry
s
profession
no
right
arm
to
use
meant
nothing
to
do
whatever
and
so
he
was
thankful
enough
that
courage
and
the
bennetts
had
found
their
way
down
to
old
virginia
and
that
he
had
been
able
to
plan
and
carry
out
so
many
delightful
excursions
for
their
enjoyment
but
the
summer
s
crown
of
pleasure
as
far
as
the
bennetts
were
concerned
had
been
the
days
spent
at
ellismere
with
brevet
on
his
island
i
half
believe
i
have
not
mentioned
this
island
before
for
which
omission
i
am
perfectly
confident
brevet
would
never
forgive
me
the
idea
of
trying
to
write
anything
whatever
about
him
and
not
tell
about
that
island
the
very
first
thing
it
was
altogether
a
wonderful
place
i
assure
you
it
lay
about
a
hundred
feet
out
from
the
shore
just
in
front
of
the
ellismere
homestead
and
as
there
was
not
another
island
within
sight
of
it
brevet
always
gratefully
cherished
the
belief
that
it
had
been
placed
there
just
for
him
it
was
about
seventy
feet
long
and
almost
as
wide
and
it
boasted
a
steep
little
ledge
of
rock
on
the
side
near
the
shore
and
two
very
respectable
little
pine
trees
but
it
was
what
the
hand
of
man
had
achieved
upon
this
little
island
that
made
it
the
wonderful
place
it
was
and
that
hand
none
other
than
old
black
joe
s
it
was
he
who
had
said
one
sunshiny
may
morning
brevet
i
ll
build
a
camp
for
you
over
on
that
island
and
true
to
his
word
joe
had
driven
up
to
ellismere
every
day
that
summer
that
he
could
spare
from
his
not
very
arduous
duties
at
arlington
and
he
had
worked
away
as
zealously
as
though
he
had
assumed
the
work
under
contract
as
a
result
it
had
been
finished
the
october
previous
and
brevet
had
had
several
weeks
to
enjoy
it
before
the
cold
weather
obliged
him
to
break
camp
for
the
winter
grandma
ellis
s
contribution
to
the
scheme
had
been
a
cedar
and
a
pair
of
spoon
oars
by
which
to
have
communication
with
the
island
but
for
everything
else
joe
was
to
be
thanked
he
had
cut
and
sewed
the
tent
to
say
nothing
of
a
canvas
cot
he
had
manufactured
tables
and
chairs
and
best
of
all
a
soldier
s
chest
with
howard
stanhope
ellis
burned
in
letters
upon
the
lid
there
was
even
a
little
desk
of
rude
contrivance
upon
which
brevet
after
the
successful
conclusion
of
most
exciting
battles
would
write
cheering
letters
home
to
his
grandmother
outside
of
the
tent
hung
a
kettle
over
a
bed
of
ashes
that
bore
witness
to
many
a
good
meal
cooked
within
it
while
on
the
rocky
ledge
above
a
toy
brass
cannon
commanded
the
harbour
making
the
island
quite
invulnerable
from
any
assault
that
might
be
attempted
from
the
side
near
the
shore
was
it
strange
then
that
to
the
bennetts
and
especially
to
the
boys
teddy
and
allan
this
unique
little
spot
with
its
perfect
equipment
offered
more
possibilities
of
good
times
than
anything
they
themselves
could
in
any
way
concoct
or
invent
and
they
had
lived
up
to
their
possibilities
though
that
had
involved
living
at
ellismere
most
of
the
time
however
grandma
ellis
assured
courage
they
were
not
a
bit
of
trouble
and
courage
took
her
at
her
word
for
the
sake
of
what
it
meant
to
the
children
but
of
all
the
and
happy
days
none
had
seemed
quite
so
exciting
and
happy
as
the
day
to
which
we
have
now
come
in
this
story
perhaps
the
fact
that
there
could
not
by
any
chance
be
many
more
of
these
times
lent
its
own
specially
brightening
charm
to
the
blessings
that
must
soon
take
their
flight
for
it
was
the
of
august
by
the
calendar
and
by
the
middle
of
september
little
homespun
would
be
closed
and
courage
and
the
bennetts
have
taken
their
departure
joe
had
been
with
the
children
all
day
and
he
was
the
one
to
be
thanked
for
most
of
its
wildly
exciting
features
but
supposed
to
represent
a
whole
regiment
he
had
tried
in
a
score
of
ways
to
effect
a
landing
on
the
island
but
by
dint
of
unceasing
vigi
lance
the
children
had
succeeded
in
keeping
him
at
bay
until
at
last
despairing
and
exhausted
he
had
beaten
a
retreat
to
the
main
land
indeed
so
hard
and
unremitting
had
been
the
labours
of
the
children
that
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
courage
who
had
been
having
an
chat
with
grandma
ellis
and
was
afraid
the
children
would
quite
wear
themselves
out
succeeded
in
coaxing
them
to
the
shore
under
promise
of
a
story
and
it
was
not
to
be
any
ordinary
story
either
naturally
in
her
daily
contact
with
the
children
courage
had
alluded
now
and
then
to
her
own
childhood
and
with
the
result
that
they
had
extracted
from
her
the
pledge
that
she
would
tell
them
all
about
it
some
day
but
as
yet
courage
s
some
day
never
had
dawned
although
they
had
repeatedly
begged
for
the
story
now
they
concluded
the
time
had
come
to
take
a
stand
will
you
tell
us
the
story
about
yourself
if
we
come
over
teddy
called
from
the
island
we
are
all
agreed
we
can
not
think
of
laying
down
our
arms
unless
you
agreed
courage
called
back
glad
to
commit
them
to
an
hour
of
quiet
at
any
cost
and
so
the
children
embarked
and
rowed
over
and
grandma
entreated
so
hard
that
she
might
be
allowed
to
listen
too
that
courage
yielded
and
the
little
group
gathered
itself
about
her
big
on
the
gallery
joe
was
also
permitted
to
form
one
of
the
party
but
there
was
another
listener
who
would
not
have
been
tolerated
for
a
moment
if
his
whereabouts
had
been
known
he
was
stretched
full
length
on
the
sofa
just
between
the
windows
in
the
and
knowing
it
would
be
quite
impossible
for
him
to
gain
permission
to
be
a
hearer
he
was
just
sufficiently
unprincipled
to
listen
without
so
much
as
saying
by
your
you
know
the
story
that
courage
told
if
not
you
may
read
it
if
you
have
a
mind
in
the
little
book
to
which
this
is
a
sequel
at
the
outset
of
course
she
told
how
she
had
come
by
her
unusual
name
which
was
the
greatest
relief
to
joe
and
brevet
they
had
wanted
so
much
to
have
that
explained
the
whole
summer
through
and
yet
had
not
quite
liked
to
ask
the
remainder
of
the
story
was
new
to
all
save
grandma
ellis
and
courage
now
that
she
had
really
started
tried
to
be
faithful
to
every
detail
that
could
possibly
have
any
interest
from
the
day
of
her
christening
to
the
night
when
the
draw
was
open
and
she
took
her
wild
leap
in
the
darkness
when
she
had
finished
every
one
sat
perfectly
still
for
a
minute
courage
told
her
own
story
much
better
than
any
one
else
has
told
or
could
tell
it
and
her
great
absorbing
love
for
miss
julia
shone
out
like
a
golden
thread
all
through
the
telling
grandma
ellis
was
the
first
to
draw
a
long
breath
and
break
the
silence
oh
but
i
wish
i
might
have
known
your
miss
julia
she
said
you
know
somebody
who
is
just
exactly
like
her
said
mary
bennett
putting
her
arm
about
courage
exactly
and
this
she
said
very
slowly
and
firmly
as
though
she
thought
courage
might
be
inclined
to
differ
with
her
but
courage
only
said
dear
child
in
a
low
whisper
so
grateful
was
she
for
the
most
blessed
praise
that
could
possibly
come
to
her
let
us
see
miss
julia
s
picture
now
please
urged
the
children
and
courage
drew
from
her
dress
an
exquisite
miniature
set
in
pearls
and
attached
to
a
violet
ribbon
worn
about
her
neck
they
had
all
seen
it
many
a
time
before
but
it
seemed
to
take
on
a
new
beauty
in
the
light
of
all
they
had
been
hearing
it
was
when
the
picture
had
been
passed
slowly
from
hand
to
hand
and
the
natural
thing
seemed
to
be
for
the
little
party
to
break
up
that
allan
was
the
first
to
discover
that
one
of
the
party
had
disappeared
why
where
is
brevet
he
exclaimed
as
though
part
of
his
personal
belongings
had
given
him
the
slip
why
sure
nuff
where
is
dat
chile
queried
joe
getting
up
from
his
chair
a
little
stiffly
and
peering
up
to
the
gallery
roof
and
to
the
branches
of
the
trees
as
though
the
most
unlikely
spot
imaginable
was
precisely
the
spot
in
which
to
expect
to
find
his
little
captain
seems
to
me
it
looks
a
little
ugly
over
there
toward
fort
meyer
he
added
stepping
to
the
end
of
the
porch
and
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
at
these
words
harry
who
had
been
thinking
over
all
he
had
heard
rose
noiselessly
from
the
lounge
and
slipped
away
to
the
rear
of
the
house
there
he
saw
at
a
glance
that
it
did
indeed
look
more
than
a
little
ugly
over
toward
fort
meyer
a
large
cloud
of
a
dark
brown
color
loomed
high
on
the
horizon
and
harry
s
heart
sank
within
him
he
had
seen
and
known
during
a
summer
s
surveying
in
the
west
the
wreck
and
ruin
that
may
follow
in
the
train
of
such
a
cloud
and
he
knew
that
everything
should
be
gotten
into
shape
as
quickly
as
possible
hurrying
quickly
to
the
front
porch
he
said
with
as
much
composure
as
he
could
muster
you
would
better
go
directly
into
the
house
grandma
we
may
be
going
to
have
quite
a
storm
send
the
children
through
all
the
rooms
and
have
every
shutter
drawn
to
and
every
window
closed
and
but
brevet
said
grandma
trying
her
best
to
keep
her
voice
steady
no
one
knows
where
brevet
is
no
one
saw
him
go
or
has
any
idea
where
he
oh
he
can
t
be
far
away
harry
answered
cheerily
joe
and
i
will
find
him
in
a
jiffy
now
you
do
as
i
say
grandma
gently
pushing
her
toward
the
door
and
children
whisk
these
chairs
into
the
house
and
then
make
for
the
doors
and
windows
and
close
them
tightly
don
t
stop
to
look
or
lose
a
single
harry
succeeded
in
speaking
calmly
but
his
manner
showed
how
urgent
he
deemed
the
need
of
haste
and
try
as
she
would
grandma
found
herself
unequal
to
the
occasion
her
limbs
refused
to
support
her
and
once
inside
the
house
she
sank
into
the
nearest
chair
and
burying
her
face
in
her
hands
broke
into
an
agony
of
sobs
and
tears
to
have
little
brevet
missing
at
such
an
anxious
moment
was
more
than
her
nerves
could
bear
courage
saw
instantly
it
was
for
her
to
take
command
of
the
situation
and
sending
the
children
hither
and
thither
through
the
house
as
harry
had
directed
she
herself
hurried
away
for
the
stimulant
of
which
grandma
ellis
so
sorely
stood
in
need
meanwhile
poor
old
joe
who
in
his
alarm
for
brevet
s
safety
had
lost
his
head
completely
had
been
wasting
precious
moments
in
looking
in
the
most
impossible
places
oh
mars
harry
whar
can
dat
blessed
child
be
he
said
coming
up
to
harry
with
the
tears
streaming
down
his
face
have
you
looked
over
on
the
island
joe
oh
i
never
thought
of
dat
mars
harry
but
the
misery
that
was
in
joe
s
voice
showed
that
he
took
in
instantly
all
the
dreadful
possibilities
if
the
storm
should
break
with
brevet
alone
on
the
island
they
hurried
as
fast
as
they
could
to
the
shore
and
there
sure
enough
was
brevet
hard
at
work
getting
his
little
camp
into
shape
for
the
coming
storm
he
had
evidently
been
the
first
to
discover
at
that
precise
moment
he
was
busy
hauling
down
the
little
camp
flag
but
that
he
was
not
in
the
least
disconcerted
was
perfectly
evident
in
the
awful
ominous
hush
preceding
the
storm
they
could
even
catch
the
familiar
strain
of
i
se
a
little
alabama
we
must
not
frighten
him
joe
harry
said
his
breath
coming
short
and
fast
we
must
just
call
to
him
to
come
right
back
but
where
is
the
boat
joe
is
the
boat
oh
mars
harry
mars
harry
look
dere
and
now
the
fear
in
joe
s
voice
had
turned
to
veriest
anguish
and
harry
looking
saw
the
precious
boat
in
the
oars
still
resting
in
the
but
as
hopelessly
beyond
reach
as
though
in
oh
joe
cried
harry
looking
down
at
the
helpless
arm
bound
firmly
in
the
splints
then
crying
i
will
get
a
man
from
the
stables
stay
right
where
you
are
joe
he
was
gone
in
a
flash
a
man
from
the
stables
joe
knew
how
long
that
must
take
no
there
was
just
one
thing
to
be
done
and
stripping
off
boots
and
jacket
in
the
next
second
he
was
breast
deep
in
the
water
and
in
the
next
striking
out
bravely
for
the
island
it
was
a
hard
tug
for
the
old
man
for
the
current
was
strong
but
brevet
still
unmindful
of
his
danger
sang
away
with
a
will
and
the
words
came
distinctly
over
the
water
i
se
a
little
alabama
coon
i
hasn
t
been
born
very
bless
your
heart
no
you
hasn
t
muttered
joe
keeping
his
head
well
above
water
you
hasn
t
been
born
long
nuff
ter
go
out
dis
worl
yet
awhile
i
m
thinkin
and
nerved
by
the
little
fellow
s
unconscious
calmness
joe
put
all
his
strength
in
four
or
five
more
good
strokes
and
reached
the
camp
but
he
had
no
breath
left
with
which
to
speak
when
he
reached
it
it
was
dreadful
to
waste
the
precious
moments
but
his
breath
was
still
too
laboured
from
the
strenuous
effort
he
had
been
making
for
him
to
voice
a
single
word
just
at
that
moment
brevet
turned
to
hurry
down
from
the
camp
and
then
stood
riveted
to
the
spot
his
face
white
with
terror
he
did
not
see
joe
in
the
dismay
of
his
discovery
oh
my
boat
is
gone
he
cried
lifting
his
two
little
clenched
hands
in
helpless
consternation
illustration
but
here
s
your
cap
ll
rang
out
a
dear
familiar
voice
and
joe
thanked
god
that
he
was
able
to
instantly
dispel
the
little
fellow
s
fears
one
bound
and
brevet
was
at
joe
s
side
did
you
swim
over
for
me
captain
his
two
arms
locked
about
joe
s
neck
in
his
joy
yes
i
done
swim
ober
for
you
honey
an
now
we
done
goin
ter
swim
back
again
des
get
on
my
ole
back
dis
honey
only
have
a
care
not
ter
choke
me
an
don
be
for
a
it
was
hardly
necessary
for
joe
to
have
added
that
for
on
joe
s
back
brevet
felt
as
safe
as
any
of
the
rest
of
us
on
the
deck
of
an
ocean
steamer
besides
it
was
such
fun
to
be
carried
ashore
in
that
fashion
only
once
it
seemed
to
cross
his
little
mind
that
it
might
perhaps
be
rather
hard
work
for
joe
if
i
m
too
heavy
i
think
i
could
swim
all
right
shall
i
leave
go
no
gasped
joe
fearing
the
dauntless
little
fellow
might
put
his
suggestion
immediately
into
practice
for
heben
s
sake
no
brevet
and
then
brevet
tightened
his
hold
as
though
realising
there
might
be
some
danger
how
great
the
danger
only
joe
himself
knew
and
he
feared
more
than
once
that
he
would
have
to
give
up
that
he
could
not
save
brevet
after
all
harry
s
search
for
help
had
been
futile
and
rushing
back
to
the
shore
what
was
his
joy
to
discover
that
joe
had
dared
to
disobey
orders
and
had
safely
crossed
to
the
island
but
what
a
terrible
risk
the
old
man
was
running
and
oh
the
chagrin
young
man
that
he
was
of
not
being
able
himself
to
attempt
the
rescue
with
bated
breath
he
watched
joe
s
start
for
the
mainland
and
then
saw
instantly
how
even
the
first
return
strokes
taxed
his
strength
to
the
full
at
the
point
for
which
he
was
making
the
limbs
of
two
old
extended
out
over
the
river
and
harry
plung
ing
into
the
water
and
clinging
by
his
good
arm
to
the
heavier
of
two
parallel
branches
was
able
to
make
his
way
to
its
extreme
end
quite
a
distance
from
the
shore
steer
right
for
me
joe
he
called
in
a
voice
of
earnest
entreaty
see
where
i
am
joe
i
can
help
you
from
but
a
sudden
blackness
had
come
before
joe
s
eyes
and
he
could
see
nothing
illustration
meantime
courage
had
hurried
from
the
house
the
first
moment
she
could
be
spared
had
reached
the
river
s
edge
and
instantly
took
in
the
situation
it
would
be
little
enough
harry
could
do
even
if
poor
joe
succeeded
in
reaching
him
it
was
for
her
to
gain
some
point
as
near
him
as
possible
and
be
ready
to
lend
a
hand
as
well
throwing
aside
a
cloak
she
had
caught
up
for
protection
she
strode
into
the
water
and
by
aid
of
the
same
strong
limb
to
which
harry
was
clinging
was
able
to
take
her
place
close
behind
him
meantime
not
for
one
instant
did
harry
intermit
his
calls
of
encouragement
until
at
last
the
overhanging
branch
was
almost
reached
joe
he
then
called
in
a
voice
of
commanding
entreaty
one
stroke
more
now
lay
hold
of
me
and
you
re
joe
had
hardly
consciousness
enough
left
to
obey
but
he
made
one
stroke
more
and
then
his
arms
grasped
something
he
hardly
knew
what
with
an
iron
grip
and
barely
keeping
his
head
above
water
his
body
dragged
helplessly
down
the
river
with
the
current
and
what
shall
i
do
gasped
brevet
quickly
for
he
had
at
last
fully
realised
the
struggle
of
the
crossing
and
knew
that
joe
s
strength
was
all
but
gone
you
lay
hold
of
my
arm
brevet
cried
courage
now
let
go
of
joe
now
cling
to
me
and
pull
yourself
up
here
on
this
limb
quick
quick
brevet
don
t
lose
a
moment
there
now
lie
flat
down
and
keep
perfectly
still
with
your
arms
firm
around
the
branch
under
you
now
what
in
a
voice
of
bewildered
appeal
to
harry
can
you
shift
yourself
to
that
other
limb
and
bend
it
within
joe
s
reach
i
am
harry
spoke
through
teeth
clenched
with
the
effort
of
supporting
joe
and
his
own
dead
weight
by
that
one
arm
s
hold
on
the
branch
beside
him
it
was
not
an
easy
thing
that
harry
asked
but
retreating
toward
the
shore
a
little
way
to
a
point
where
the
branches
came
more
closely
together
she
safely
swung
to
the
other
limb
but
in
making
her
way
out
into
the
water
again
she
felt
the
ground
fall
gradually
away
beneath
her
feet
careful
careful
called
harry
don
t
get
beyond
your
i
am
all
right
courage
answered
calmly
though
she
knew
for
a
certainty
that
she
was
already
beyond
her
depth
but
what
did
that
matter
in
the
imperative
need
of
the
moment
all
this
while
joe
with
closed
eyes
still
realised
that
the
one
thing
for
him
to
do
was
to
hold
on
notwithstanding
the
deeper
water
courage
succeeded
in
working
out
along
the
branch
until
near
enough
to
joe
to
bend
it
by
her
weight
within
his
reach
then
she
cried
peremptorily
with
what
little
breath
was
left
her
joe
open
your
joe
mechanically
obeyed
now
see
this
branch
joe
reach
for
it
and
get
upon
your
feet
the
water
is
not
harry
felt
joe
s
grasp
relaxing
from
his
body
but
at
the
same
time
it
was
apparent
that
he
was
too
weak
and
dazed
to
fully
take
in
the
situation
and
was
not
about
to
make
the
effort
necessary
to
seize
the
overhanging
limb
brevet
cried
harry
under
his
breath
speak
to
joe
he
is
not
going
to
try
to
save
himself
joe
joe
called
brevet
an
agony
of
appeal
in
his
voice
joe
s
eyes
opened
again
reach
for
that
branch
joe
and
try
to
get
ashore
i
want
you
joe
i
want
you
brevet
s
dearly
loved
voice
with
its
deep
sob
of
entreaty
seemed
to
reach
some
inner
consciousness
of
joe
s
if
brevet
needed
him
he
must
make
one
last
effort
and
letting
go
his
relaxed
hold
of
harry
he
reached
for
the
branch
struggled
to
his
feet
stumbling
heavily
against
courage
took
the
necessary
steps
to
reach
the
shore
and
then
fell
utterly
unconscious
meantime
the
storm
had
broken
in
all
its
fury
a
great
yellow
whirl
of
dust
and
sand
came
sweeping
down
upon
them
carrying
broken
twigs
and
larger
branches
in
a
twinkling
past
them
then
came
the
rain
in
torrents
and
vivid
flashes
of
lightning
brevet
clung
terrified
to
the
limb
but
manly
little
fellow
that
he
was
made
no
outcry
harry
with
but
one
arm
at
his
service
hung
where
he
was
the
water
serving
to
buoy
his
body
up
and
to
sustain
his
weight
but
he
was
powerless
to
alter
his
position
courage
by
the
aid
of
the
limb
made
her
way
to
the
shore
then
calling
back
to
harry
i
will
bring
help
at
once
she
dropped
on
to
her
hands
and
knees
for
it
was
impossible
to
stand
against
the
wind
and
rain
and
began
creeping
up
the
embankment
but
fortunately
for
them
all
help
was
at
hand
teddy
bennett
fairly
blown
along
by
the
wind
appeared
on
the
ledge
above
her
courage
leaning
heavily
upon
one
hand
pointed
down
the
river
and
teddy
in
another
minute
was
in
the
water
and
close
at
harry
s
side
it
was
the
work
of
but
a
moment
strong
young
swimmer
that
he
proved
himself
to
help
harry
ashore
and
then
throwing
themselves
flat
upon
the
ground
and
calling
out
every
minute
to
brevet
to
hold
on
and
keep
a
brave
heart
they
waited
for
the
terrible
storm
to
pass
over
chapter
joe
has
an
idea
it
was
two
weeks
now
since
that
dreadful
afternoon
up
at
ellismere
and
it
has
been
a
quiet
two
weeks
for
all
of
our
little
party
no
one
has
had
the
heart
for
very
much
fun
for
grandma
ellis
has
been
very
ill
up
at
ellismere
and
dear
old
joe
is
lying
helpless
in
bed
in
his
own
little
cabin
after
the
storm
had
spent
its
force
they
had
carried
joe
up
to
the
house
and
there
he
had
lain
unmindful
of
everything
about
him
for
three
whole
days
together
then
when
at
last
consciousness
came
back
power
to
move
either
right
arm
or
leg
did
not
come
with
it
and
then
they
learned
that
poor
old
joe
was
paralysed
as
soon
as
possible
after
that
they
moved
joe
up
to
arlington
for
he
longed
for
his
own
bed
and
his
own
familiar
cabin
and
who
do
you
suppose
went
up
to
care
for
joe
but
mammy
if
you
can
spare
me
miss
lindy
mammy
had
said
to
grandma
ellis
i
would
like
to
look
out
for
joe
de
res
of
his
days
i
ain
t
allers
been
ober
kin
to
dat
ole
gem
an
an
i
ain
t
had
no
idea
what
splendid
stuff
he
had
in
him
and
it
seemed
a
very
little
thing
to
grandma
ellis
to
spare
mammy
for
the
sake
of
the
one
who
had
saved
brevet
s
life
that
joe
had
saved
it
there
was
but
little
question
for
the
storm
had
seemed
to
be
at
its
very
height
when
it
reached
the
island
levelling
and
demolishing
everything
upon
it
the
tent
had
been
carried
off
bodily
no
one
knew
where
and
the
little
pine
trees
uprooted
lay
wedged
in
the
rocks
as
though
pounded
in
with
an
anvil
so
that
it
seemed
impossible
that
brevet
could
have
escaped
being
hurled
into
the
river
or
dashed
against
the
rocks
with
the
same
terrible
force
as
the
pine
trees
harry
had
been
unable
to
bring
any
one
from
the
stables
for
both
the
men
as
it
happened
were
three
miles
away
at
the
blacksmith
s
and
but
for
joe
s
instant
action
any
help
would
have
come
too
late
i
doubt
if
teddy
will
ever
quite
forgive
grandma
ellis
or
his
sister
mary
for
forbidding
him
to
join
the
party
in
search
of
brevet
or
ever
cease
to
be
thankful
that
at
last
rushing
out
of
the
house
in
spite
of
all
their
protests
he
was
able
to
render
such
timely
aid
as
for
joe
he
accepted
his
utter
helplessness
with
a
beautiful
resignation
but
there
was
something
on
joe
s
mind
and
one
day
he
said
to
mammy
would
you
min
mammy
just
sendin
fo
miss
courage
to
come
heah
for
awhile
dis
ebenin
i

different
colour
and
miss
courage

bery
ebenin
joe
for
mammy
had
made
up
her
mind
that
joe
was
to
be
humoured
in
every
particular
and
so
courage
came
and
with
brevet
who
had
happened
to
be
spending
the
day
at
homespun
for
her
companion
they
stopped
to
leave
the
buckboard
at
the
stable
where
a
young
mulatto
boy
was
now
doing
joe
s
work
and
then
brevet
asked
permission
to
run
on
ahead
he
had
something
on
his
mind
as
well
as
joe
and
he
was
longing
to
ask
him
a
question
that
had
just
occurred
to
him
the
day
before
and
which
had
made
his
little
heart
very
heavy
joe
he
said
in
an
awed
whisper
stepping
into
the
cabin
and
looking
quickly
about
to
see
if
mammy
happened
to
be
out
of
hearing
are
you
asleep
joe
no
bless
your
little
heart
and
joe
s
old
face
lighted
up
with
the
joy
of

it
joe
in
anxious
inquiry

joe
courage
interrupted
for
if

not

rather
down
upon

no

that
she

an
so
far
as

now
do

who

no
joe
and
i
m
quite
sure
sylvia
once
told
me
that
nobody
knew
but
if
you
wish
i
can
write
and
make
some
inquiry
but
why
do
you
want
to
know
joe
why
case
i
b
lieve
it
isn
t
de
mos
impossible
t
ing
in
de
worl
dat
mammy
and
sylvy
is
related
and
joe
lowered
his
voice
to
an
almost
imperceptible
whisper
but
whatever
do
you
found
that
upon
courage
asked
eagerly
observation
miss
courage
an
what
you
might
call
human
probability
joe
was
perfectly
delighted
to
find
two
such
fine
long
words
at
his
command
an
as
i
tol
you
i
se
been
usin
my
eyes
lyin
heah
an
dey
has
little
ways
an

common
to
bof
of
em
den
you
know
mammy
had
a
daughter
sol
way
from
her
des
befo
de
wah
an
as
sylvy
ain
t
no
idea
what
name
she
was
born
to
tain
t
impossible
is
it
dat
she
should
be
mammy
s
gran
chile
no
it
isn
t
impossible
joe
but
i
must
honestly
say
i
do
not
think
it
probable
just
think
how
very
little
you
really
have
to
build
mighty
little
i
grant
you
miss
courage
cepting
dose
little
ways
an
gestures
but
you
ll
write
won
t
you
case
there
ain
t
the
least
harm
in
writing
is
there
yes
indeed
i
will
joe
this
very
night
but
you
mustn
t
hang
too
many
hopes
upon
it
so
as
not
to
be
too
much
dey
s
hung
dere
already
miss
courage
said
incorrigible
joe
an
i
se
not
goin
ter
take
em
down
till
i
has
all
right
laughed
courage
may
i
call
mammy
back
now
for
i
should
like
to
see
her
for
awhile
before
i
go
yes
you
call
her
an
des
you
notice
now
your
tention
s
called
ter
it
if
dere
isn
t
some
ways
dat
mind
you
of
and
courage
did
notice
and
was
really
so
surprised
at
some
points
of
resemblance
that
she
wrote
her
letter
that
night
with
a
deeper
conviction
that
they
might
be
on
the
verge
of
a
discovery
than
she
had
that
morning
thought
possible
chapter
brevet
scores
a
point
is
anybody
going
to
die
in
this
chapter
asked
a
little
girl
who
is
very
dear
to
me
as
we
were
reading
aloud
last
evening
the
chapter
had
certainly
a
rather
ominous
title
and
if
any
one
was
going
to
die
she
preferred
to
go
to
bed
now
if
we
had
happened
to
have
been
reading
this
story
together
i
am
pretty
sure
i
should
have
met
the
same
question
for
what
with
joe
ill
in
bed
and
grandma
ellis
ill
at
ellismere
and
both
of
them
pretty
old
people
it
does
look
i
admit
as
though
there
might
be
something
sad
to
write
about
it
but
happily
for
that
happy
summer
there
was
to
be
no
sorrowful
ending
grandma
ellis
was
soon
quite
herself
again
and
joe
improved
so
much
that
it
seemed
as
though
he
would
probably
be
able
to
move
about
his
cabin
again
some
day
and
so
everything
would
have
been
bright
and
hopeful
enough
save
for
this
the
time
had
come
for
courage
and
the
bennetts
and
mary
duff
and
sylvia
to
go
home
and
all
hearts
as
a
result
were
as
heavy
as
lead
the
bennetts
were
eager
to
see
their
father
and
mother
and
the
baby
but
they
did
not
want
to
go
back
to
the
great
crowded
city
and
courage
well
she
wondered
what
she
possibly
could
find
to
do
at
home
that
would
so
absorb
her
whole
thought
and
time
as
this
little
homespun
household
and
keep
her
half
as
happy
and
contented
she
feared
that
when
she
went
back
the
old
loneliness
would
surely
come
surging
down
upon
her
and
that
life
without
miss
julia
would
seem
again
intolerable
she
was
thinking
just
such
sad
thoughts
as
these
as
she
sat
alone
in
the
little
stitching
away
at
a
dress
of
mary
bennett
s
that
needed
mending
for
the
journey
on
the
morrow
every
one
but
herself
and
mary
duff
had
gone
up
to
arlington
for
a
call
upon
joe
courage
was
not
planning
to
go
until
late
in
the
day
calculating
that
the
afternoon
mail
would
surely
bring
her
some
word
from
the
asylum
and
so
as
she
sat
alone
with
her
own
sad
thoughts
she
was
suddenly
surprised
by
a
little
figure
in
the
doorway
and
a
larger
figure
looming
above
it
where
s
everybody
asked
brevet
may
we
come
in
yes
indeed
come
in
courage
answered
cordially
indeed
i
am
glad
to
see
you
for
i
m
as
blue
as
can
so
are
we
said
brevet
sitting
disconsolately
down
in
a
huge
armchair
that
made
him
look
more
disconsolate
than
ever
uncle
harry
s
hardly
spoken
to
me
all
the
harry
made
no
denial
and
dropped
into
the
nearest
chair
and
you
ll
be
bluer
still
brevet
to
find
that
no
one
s
at
home
courage
added
they
have
all
gone
up
to
well
that
doesn
t
matter
brevet
replied
philosophically
we
shall
see
them
all
tomorrow
when
we
come
down
to
see
you
off
but
what
we
all
care
the
most
about
is
your
going
miss
courage
a
cries
every
time
she
thinks
of
it
and
uncle
harry
says
it
will
be
just
like
a
funeral
all
the
time
for
him
until
he
is
able
to
go
back
to
the
office
and
i
m
just
as
miserable
as
i
can
well
it
s
very
kind
of
you
all
sighed
courage
it
seems
to
me
there
never
were
two
such
dear
places
as
homespun
and
and
you
can
not
imagine
how
i
hate
to
leave
what
will
you
all
do
anyway
when
you
get
back
to
new
york
brevet
asked
a
little
sullenly
as
though
he
felt
in
his
heart
that
really
they
were
to
blame
for
going
well
we
are
not
going
because
we
want
to
brevet
courage
answered
almost
sharply
for
she
was
herself
just
enough
to
be
a
trifle
touchy
and
childish
there
is
no
reason
why
mary
duff
and
sylvia
and
i
should
stay
since
the
bennetts
will
not
be
here
to
be
cared
but
what
is
the
for
your
going
home
miss
courage
asked
brevet
determined
to
have
the
whole
situation
explained
well
mary
duff
is
needed
at
the
hospital
where
she
has
charge
you
know
of
a
whole
ward
full
of
little
babies
and
as
for
sylvia
and
me
our
home
is
there
you
know
we
belong
there
and
i
shall
try
very
hard
to
find
something
to
fill
up
all
my
time
for
that
is
the
only
way
for
me
to
manage
now
that
i
no
longer
have
miss
but
do
people
always
belong
to
just
one
place
no
not
always
courage
was
forced
to
admit
well
you
and
brevet
seem
to
be
having
things
all
your
own
way
said
harry
really
speaking
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
entered
yes
i
was
thinking
it
would
be
more
polite
if
you
should
join
in
the
conversation
courage
answered
colouring
a
little
for
she
had
felt
annoyed
at
harry
s
apparently
moody
silence
well
he
added
slowly
i
do
not
know
on
the
whole
that
there
is
anything
for
me
to
then
why
did
you
come
simply
to
see
you
once
and
what
was
the
use
of
that
courage
asked
she
hardly
knew
why
no
use
simply
to
enjoy
the
pathetic
sort
of
pleasure
of
all
last
times
but
i
do
not
myself
understand
why
you
could
not
have
stayed
on
and
made
us
a
visit
you
would
have
made
my
grandmother
very
oh
harry
come
off
said
brevet
who
had
unavoidably
acquired
a
boy
s
measure
of
slang
and
who
was
old
enough
to
appreciate
when
harry
was
not
his
frank
honest
self
that
s
all
stuff
about
you
want
miss
courage
to
stay
for
yourself
just
as
much
as
wants
her
for
herself
and
i
want
her
for
children
and
fools
speak
the
truth
said
harry
looking
straight
at
courage
yes
that
s
the
blessed
beauty
of
them
looking
straight
back
at
him
other
people
don
t
dare
said
harry
other
people
lack
i
quite
agree
with
you
i
know
a
fellow
who
feels
that
with
courage
he
could
defy
the
whole
brevet
said
courage
folding
away
the
mended
dress
there
is
a
pile
of
pictures
yonder
that
i
have
been
collecting
from
the
magazines
and
papers
for
your
bring
them
here
and
let
us
look
them
brevet
was
not
to
be
diverted
it
was
always
one
thing
at
a
time
with
him
the
pictures
could
wait
he
couldn
t
he
had
one
or
two
questions
yet
to
ask
and
he
came
and
stood
beside
courage
as
though
to
compel
her
undivided
attention
but
why
couldn
t
you
visit
us
didn
t
you
want
to
yes
i
should
have
been
glad
to
come
brevet
i
can
not
explain
to
you
why
i
couldn
i
suppose
it
was
because
there
wasn
t
anything
particular
for
you
to
do
you
always
want
to
be
doing
something
now
miss
courage
i
have
heard
say
that
if
uncle
harry
would
bring
a
wife
home
to
ellismere
some
day
she
would
give
her
all
the
housekeeping
now
don
t
you
think
you
could
come
that
way
because
then
you
would
have
a
great
deal
to
do
can
you
not
stop
this
child
said
courage
turning
with
a
look
of
indignant
appeal
to
harry
he
is
doing
very
well
harry
answered
without
looking
up
brevet
intent
upon
his
own
line
of
thought
paid
not
the
least
attention
to
either
of
the
last
remarks
now
miss
courage
resting
one
arm
on
her
chair
and
speaking
thoughtfully
and
slowly
couldn
t
you
don
t
you
think
you
could
perhaps
be
uncle
harry
s
wife
and
so
belong
up
to
our
house
and
have
lots
of
things
to
do
yes
couldn
t
you
perhaps
said
harry
very
earnestly
courage
gave
one
glance
toward
harry
and
then
sat
gazing
straight
at
brevet
with
a
look
on
her
face
as
though
endeavouring
to
frame
some
sort
of
answer
while
brevet
with
appeal
in
his
eyes
more
eloquent
than
words
waited
in
solemn
silence
for
her
answer
but
brevet
she
said
at
last
are
you
sure
perfectly
sure
that
your
uncle
harry
would
not
mind
perfectly
sure
but
not
so
much
as
looking
toward
harry
so
completely
did
he
regard
the
matter
as
resting
wholly
between
courage
and
himself
well
then
brevet
i
believe
i
then
for
the
first
time
brevet
showed
an
inclination
to
include
harry
in
the
conversation
but
for
that
matter
he
had
to
for
harry
was
close
beside
courage
now
there
he
said
with
a
great
sigh
of
relief
what
did
i
tell
you
perhaps
she
doesn
t
care
enough
to
do
it
for
you
but
she
cares
enough
to
do
it
for
us
all
three
run
brevet
said
courage
see
there
is
mary
coming
with
the
mail
run
and
bring
it
brevet
scampered
off
in
high
feather
and
courage
instantly
straightened
herself
up
and
looked
accusingly
at
harry
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
actually
talked
all
this
over
with
brevet
illustration
no
he
answered
never
looking
so
handsome
or
so
happy
in
his
life
he
talked
it
all
over
with
me
he
seemed
to
think
it
the
one
way
out
of
the
and
you
knew
he
was
he
was
going
to
say
all
this
to
me
no
i
never
so
much
as
dreamt
it
for
a
minute
i
assure
you
or
that
he
was
going
to
take
matters
into
his
own
hands
on
the
contrary
i
wanted
to
come
alone
this
afternoon
but
come
he
would
he
had
evidently
thought
out
his
own
course
of
action
and
i
shall
bless
him
for
it
all
my
chapter
a
afternoon
they
were
a
happy
trio
that
set
out
for
arlington
a
half
hour
later
harry
and
courage
walked
closely
side
by
side
for
there
was
much
to
be
said
that
could
not
by
any
chance
have
any
interest
for
brevet
besides
you
could
not
have
kept
brevet
still
enough
for
five
seconds
together
to
listen
to
anything
he
was
quite
as
wild
with
joy
as
any
little
terrier
liberated
from
his
kennel
for
the
first
run
over
the
hills
in
a
fortnight
but
the
joy
that
made
him
run
hither
and
thither
and
come
bounding
back
to
press
a
flower
into
courage
s
hands
or
simply
to
look
up
to
her
face
or
brush
affectionately
against
her
in
true
terrier
fashion
was
something
more
than
animal
spirits
courage
was
coming
up
to
ellismere
to
live
courage
was
coming
no
little
songster
was
ever
more
joyous
over
the
coming
of
spring
and
brevet
would
have
trilled
as
glad
a
carol
if
he
could
but
of
the
three
courage
was
if
possible
the
very
happiest
for
she
had
such
a
happy
secret
in
her
keeping
that
is
in
her
pocket
for
the
mail
had
brought
the
expected
letter
the
secret
however
must
stay
a
secret
until
she
should
reach
arlington
and
could
have
a
little
private
talk
with
joe
and
so
she
hurried
harry
along
much
faster
than
was
at
all
to
his
liking
for
harry
would
have
been
glad
to
have
that
walk
last
for
a
year
and
a
day
and
so
perhaps
would
courage
save
for
the
letter
it
was
not
that
it
contained
any
wonderful
revelation
it
simply
said
that
unfortunately
the
asylum
authorities
knew
nothing
more
of
sylvia
s
antecedents
than
she
herself
knew
that
she
had
simply
been
thrust
in
at
the
asylum
door
by
some
old
woman
who
succeeded
in
beating
a
mysterious
retreat
into
the
darkness
before
any
one
had
seen
her
a
scrap
of
paper
pinned
to
her
dress
bore
the
name
of
sylvia
and
the
statement
that
the
child
had
neither
father
nor
mother
in
addition
to
this
the
only
possible
clew
lay
in
two
or
three
articles
found
at
the
time
in
sylvia
s
keeping
they
had
been
given
to
her
when
she
left
the
institution
the
matron
impressing
upon
her
the
need
and
importance
of
guarding
them
carefully
as
they
would
possibly
prove
of
great
value
some
day
they
regretted
very
keenly
that
they
were
unable
to
furnish
any
further
information
but
nevertheless
the
letter
stirred
the
first
real
hope
for
courage
that
joe
was
right
in
his
conjecture
for
it
reminded
her
of
the
little
belongings
sylvia
had
once
shown
her
a
coral
necklace
a
gay
little
silver
belt
set
with
imitation
turquoise
and
rubies
in
great
variety
and
a
devotional
book
she
remembered
there
was
no
writing
in
the
book
save
the
name
of
what
appeared
to
be
some
gentleman
s
and
some
date
way
back
in
the
fifties
she
could
not
recall
the
name
but
she
thought
she
would
know
it
if
she
heard
it
and
felt
quite
sure
now
that
she
came
to
think
of
it
that
she
had
heard
a
name
on
mammy
s
lips
that
sounded
like
it
no
wonder
that
something
seemed
far
more
important
just
then
than
even
her
own
great
happiness
and
that
she
was
impatient
to
reach
joe
s
cabin
i
will
hurry
on
she
said
when
they
came
in
sight
of
the
cabin
you
capture
brevet
harry
and
make
him
understand
that
he
will
be
reduced
to
the
ranks
if
he
says
one
word
down
here
of
what
has
happened
up
at
homespun
your
mother
must
be
the
first
to
you
have
set
me
a
rather
difficult
task
laughed
harry
but
he
saw
the
wisdom
of
it
and
bearing
down
upon
brevet
he
detained
him
an
unwilling
little
prisoner
until
he
had
extracted
but
slowly
and
painfully
it
must
be
confessed
the
required
promise
courage
found
the
little
cabin
full
that
is
mary
duff
sylvia
and
the
children
all
were
there
as
she
expected
but
a
word
to
mammy
to
whom
courage
s
slightest
wish
was
law
and
the
little
cabin
was
cleared
in
a
twinkling
all
hands
finding
themselves
peremptorily
shooed
like
a
pack
of
geese
to
the
pond
below
under
some
foolish
pretext
or
other
has
the
letter
come
joe
asked
breathlessly
any
news
in
it
yes
i
have
a
letter
and
courage
drew
a
close
to
the
bed
but
there
is
nothing
new
in
it
only
it
suggests
something
to
me
it
speaks
of
some
treasures
of
sylvia
s
that
might
throw
a
little
light
on
the
subject
i
remember
now
that
sylvia
once
showed
them
to
me
and
i
do
not
see
why
i
have
been
so
stupid
as
not
to
think
of
them
before
they
were
a
string
of
coral
beads
a
gay
belt
of
some
sort
and
a
little
devotional
anythin
written
in
de
book
interrupted
joe
his
clasped
hands
trembling
with
excitement
nothing
much
joe
we
mustn
t
grow
too
hopeful
quite
yet
but
i
am
quite
sure
it
was
some
name
such
as
would
belong
to
a
gentleman
s
and
i
think
i
should
recall
it
if
i
heard
it
now
doesn
t
mammy
sometimes
speak
of
the
plantation
where
she
used
to
live
by
some
name
or
other
sunnyside
panted
joe
sunnyside
it
s
on
her
lips
eb
ry
day
or
two
do
you
t
ink
do
you
t
ink
dat
s
it
oh
i
don
t
dare
to
think
joe
it
would
be
so
easy
for
me
to
be
mistaken
call
mammy
then
call
sylvy
joe
cried
excitedly
call
dem
quick
yes
i
will
call
them
right
away
but
joe
we
must
all
try
to
be
calm
for
she
feared
the
effect
of
so
much
excitement
you
must
be
calm
for
your
own
sake
joe
and
for
theirs
and
if
we
should
chance
to
be
on
the
verge
of
a
happy
discovery
we
must
not
spring
it
too
suddenly
upon
them
let
me
talk
to
them
a
little
before
you
ask
sylvia
about
the
but
courage
in
her
own
mind
was
quite
joyously
sure
that
sunnyside
was
the
name
in
the
little
book
mammy
and
sylvia
came
in
answer
to
the
call
from
courage
mary
duff
and
the
bennetts
wondering
what
was
up
remained
perforce
just
as
obediently
behind
sylvia
said
courage
signalling
joe
to
be
quiet
for
a
moment
do
you
remember
once
showing
me
a
little
devotional
book
of
yours
i
was
trying
just
now
to
remember
its
of
jesus
miss
words
of
jesus
said
mammy
solemnly
oh
but
i
loved
dat
little
book
my
missus
gave
it
to
me
years
ago
an
i
gave
it
to
my
little
girl
when
she
was
sol
away
from
me
way
down
in
and
sylvia
there
were
some
other
little
things
were
there
not
yes
miss
courage
a
little
string
of
coral
beads
and
a
tinsel
belt
you
joe
and
courage
were
looking
straight
at
mammy
who
ashy
white
under
her
dark
skin
leaned
against
the
foot
of
the
bed
but
sylvia
all
intent
upon
joe
did
not
notice
come
nearer
chile
said
joe
for
his
turn
had
come
now
although
his
voice
all
but
failed
him
as
he
took
sylvia
s
hand
in
his
was
somethin
written
in
de
little
book
yes
said
sylvia
her
own
voice
unsteady
now
for
she
knew
there
must
be
some
object
in
all
this
questioning
have
a
care
now
mammy
cried
joe
exultingly
something
may
be
going
to
happen
mammy
was
it
sunnyside
chile
yes
it
was
sunnyside
she
answered
eagerly
what
do
you
know
about
it
joe
but
before
joe
could
explain
mammy
s
arms
were
about
her
in
one
wild
ecstasy
of
delight
and
then
dropping
into
a
chair
she
drew
sylvia
to
her
lap
illustration
o
course
it
was
sunnyside
chile
what
else
could
it
be
after
yo
sayin
you
owned
de
corals
an
de
tinsel
belt
i
gave
dem
all
three
to
my
little
daughter
thirty
years
an
more
ago
yo
b
longs
ter
me
but
mammy
dear
who
do
you

dese
years
but
how
can
you
be
sure
mammy
my
having
the
things
doesn
t
surely
make
me
your
grandchild
and
sylvia
looked
as
though
not
to
be
able
to
be
perfectly
certain
at
last
would
quite
break
her
heart
sure
by
eb
ryt
ing
bout
you
honey
by
yo
face
by
yo
hands
by
de
way
you
walk
by
yo
ebery
motion
by
de
way
you
drink
a
cup
o
tea
maria
was
jus
about
yo
age
when
she
was
sol
away
from
me
an
sometimes
you
ve
so
much
minded
me
of
her
i
could
scarce
bear
to
look
at
you
neber
dreamin
you
could
possibly
b
long
ter
me
but
sylvy
and
mammy
s
voice
at
once
grew
troubled
with
the
thought
that
occurred
to
her
why
hab
you
neber
done
try
to
fin
yo
own
people
chile
why
mammy
i
knew
nothing
about
myself
at
all
i
was
just
pushed
into
the
door
of
a
coloured
orphan
asylum
in
brooklyn
when
i
was
a
little
bit
of
a
girl
by
a
very
old
woman
i
remember
and
i
never
saw
or
heard
of
her
again
there
was
a
little
piece
of
paper
pinned
on
to
my
dress
which
merely
said
this
little
girl
hasn
t
got
any
father
or
mother
and
that
my
name
was
then
yo
mamma
s
daid
is
she
said
mammy
in
a
low
voice
as
though
speaking
to
herself
i
wonder
who
she
married
an
how
she
drifted
way
up
north
an
why
she
never
wrote
to
her
old
mammy
but
we
ll
never
know
in
dis
work
will
we
honey
but
no
matter
no
matter
we
s
got
each
oder
now
sylvy
and
mammy
stroked
sylvia
s
hair
with
one
trembling
hand
as
the
happy
realisation
chased
all
the
sadness
from
her
face
maria
coaxed
that
little
belt
from
me
she
continued
never
one
moment
taking
her
eyes
from
sylvia
s
face
one
day
long
fo
she
was
sol
from
me
my
missus
had
given
it
to
me
when
i
was
jus
a
slip
of
a
girl
she
gave
me
the
dear
book
too
but
i
put
that
into
maria
s
pocket
an
begged
her
to
read
it
now
an
again
cause
maria
allers
seemed
too
lighthearted
to
give
much
tention
to
religion
seems
as
d
ough
could
hardly
wait
sylvy
to
lay
my
eyes
on
d
ose
little
keepsakes
once
more
an
sylvy

some
of
my

people
down
here
in
lor
chile
you
didn
t
dream
what
gospel
trufes
you
were
speakin
meantime
harry
and
brevet
had
appeared
upon
the
scene
and
astonished
beyond
measure
at
what
they
saw
and
heard
sat
down
on
a
bench
beside
the
door
and
listened
in
mute
wonder
but
who
said
mammy
at
last
when
she
could
bring
her
confused
thoughts
into
some
sort
of
order
and
with
sylvia
still
seated
upon
her
lap
who
was
de
one
to
find
all
dis
out
for
me
turning
toward
courage
for
an
explanation
but
courage
simply
looked
toward
joe
for
answer
yes
mammy
replied
joe
leaning
comfortably
back
against
his
pillows
the
embodiment
of
dusky
radiance
i
has
dat

so
helpless
when

courage
of

treasures

minded
how
sylvy
had
once
showed
dem
to

an
how
dere

but
o

my
life
an
it
s
all
come
of
me
being
par
lysed
an
havin
a
chance
ter
notice
and
joe
spoke
as
though
the
paralysis
was
unquestionably
something
for
which
he
had
need
to
be
devoutly
thankful
joe
said
mammy
who
had
left
her
chair
and
was
standing
close
at
his
bedside
i
se
been
hard
on
you
an
unfair
to
you
mos
o
my
life
joe
and
she
stood
looking
down
as
shamefacedly
as
any
little
school
culprit
don
t
you
say
nuffin
mammy
hasn
t
i
allers
been
hard
on
you
an
unfair
to
you
don
t
either
of
you
say
anything
interrupted
courage
if
ever
two
people
in
this
world
have
made
up
for
bygones
i
think
you
two
people
have
and
joe
and
mammy
shook
their
old
heads
in
assent
for
happily
for
them
both
they
knew
that
courage
had
spoken
but
the
truth
meantime
brevet
had
slipped
away
and
had
enjoyed
the
exquisite
pleasure
of
telling
mary
duff
and
the
bennetts
the
wonderful
news
whereupon
they
had
of
course
hurried
up
to
the
cabin
and
joined
in
the
general
jubilation
it
was
sunset
before
the
were
said
those
last
they
had
come
for
the
purpose
of
saying
and
before
they
were
all
started
on
their
walk
home
then
courage
turned
to
harry
i
think
i
will
run
back
and
joe
and
mammy
tell
all
the
world
said
harry
proudly
the
sooner
the
a
few
minutes
later
courage
appeared
in
the
cabin
doorway
come
here
she
said
motioning
to
mammy
and
hurrying
to
joe
s
side
there
s
another
secret
in
the
wind
this
afternoon
and
i
want
to
tell
it
to
both
of
you
myself
i
think
i
shall
come
down
here
to
live
for
good
and
all
before
long
de
lord
be
praised
ejaculated
joe
and
mammy
in
one
breath
and
i
m
coming
because
i
am
going
to
marry
harry
ellis
is
de
lord
s
own
doin
s
cried
joe
fervently
for
we
all
need
and
never
you
fear
but
sylvia
will
live
here
too
said
courage
turning
radiantly
to
mammy
then
in
a
flash
she
was
gone
to
hurry
after
the
little
party
over
the
road
with
harry
and
brevet
courage
went
straight
up
to
ellismere
that
night
to
see
grandma
ellis
and
then
another
dear
old
heart
was
gladdened
beyond
all
words
by
the
good
news
she
had
to
tell
the
next
day
courage
went
back
to
town
with
the
bennetts
leaving
sylvia
to
stay
with
mammy
until
she
should
return
and
courage
was
to
return
before
very
long
a
good
deal
had
been
talked
over
and
arranged
for
in
the
evening
spent
at
ellismere
and
among
other
things
that
there
should
be
a
wedding
at
little
homespun
late
in
october
by
that
time
probably
joe
would
be
able
to
drive
up
from
arlington
and
colonel
anderson
would
come
down
from
washington
and
courage
knew
that
the
everetts
and
a
few
other
dear
friends
would
come
down
just
as
gladly
from
new
york
and
another
matter
that
had
been
as
fully
agreed
upon
was
that
although
courage
s
home
was
to
be
at
ellismere
for
the
winter
she
and
harry
should
move
up
to
little
homespun
the
coming
summer
and
mary
duff
should
bring
down
some
other
party
of
little
to
run
wild
and
enjoy
all
the
delights
of
the
unknown
country
just
as
the
little
bennetts
had
done
and
so
it
came
about
that
there
was
no
real
sadness
in
the
which
were
said
on
the
morrow
even
the
bennetts
found
they
were
glad
to
go
now
it
came
to
the
point
for
when
all
is
said
home
is
home
the
world
over
harry
and
brevet
drove
up
to
washington
to
see
the
little
party
off
and
then
drove
back
to
ellismere
not
saying
much
to
each
other
by
the
way
but
both
very
contented
and
happy
brevet
was
humming
his
own
favourite
air
as
in
all
serene
and
quiet
moods
until
at
last
as
though
to
give
vent
to
the
joy
within
him
he
broke
into
the
old
words
i
se
a
little
alabama
coon
i
hasn
t
been
born
very
right
you
are
laughed
harry
interrupting
and
a
dear
little
coon
into
the
bargain
and
who
has
been
born
quite
long
enough
to
make
the
time
what
do
you
mean
asked
brevet
with
puzzled
frown
oh
i
mean
you
ve
been
born
long
enough
to
accomplish
quite
a
great
deal
on
the
whole
and
the
finest
work
you
ever
put
in
was
up
at
little
homespun
you
mean
about
asking
miss
courage
to
come
back
exactly
i
think
your
name
will
always
stick
to
you
now
i
m
sure
i
shall
never
call
you
by
any
other
you
mean
my
name
brevet
but
why
i
do
not
quite
understand
for
brevet
s
ideas
had
really
grown
a
little
hazy
as
to
the
full
meaning
of
his
name
why
joe
gave
you
the
name
you
remember
because
that
is
a
title
given
in
the
army
simply
as
a
reward
of
merit
you
have
the
honour
that
is
of
being
a
captain
without
the
responsibility
now
it
seems
to
me
the
title
belongs
to
you
more
than
ever
since
yesterday
afternoon
you
sailed
right
in
and
have
won
all
the
glory
of
persuading
miss
courage
to
come
back
to
virginia
but
i
do
not
see
that
you
have
assumed
a
grain
of
responsibility
it
is
a
serious
thing
to
have
induced
her
to
exchange
her
home
for
ours
now
who
s
going
to
see
when
she
comes
that
she
s
always
perfectly
happy
and
contented
i
d
like
to
know
you
are
the
one
to
see
to
that
uncle
harry
isn
t
that
what
husbands
have
to
do
besides
i
don
t
think
it
s
fair
to
blame
me
when
you
yourself
wanted
her
so
much
to
bless
your
dear
little
heart
who
thought
of
blame
for
a
minute
irresponsible
little
rascal
though
you
be
you
have
earned
your
proud
title
and
you
shall
be
to
the
end
of
the
brevet
did
not
quite
understand
this
either
but
that
did
not
matter
he
knew
that
he
had
succeeded
in
making
everybody
very
happy
uncle
harry
in
particular
and
for
the
present
that
was
quite
enough
to
know
and
to
understand
the
end
