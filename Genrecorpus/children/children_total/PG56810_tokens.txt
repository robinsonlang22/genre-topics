introduction
the
story
of
ivar
the
viking
depicts
the
actual
life
of
norse
chiefs
who
ruled
at
the
period
therein
described
and
also
gives
the
customs
religion
life
and
mode
of
thinking
which
prevailed
among
the
people
my
object
in
writing
this
story
is
to
give
a
view
in
a
popular
way
of
the
life
of
these
early
ancestors
of
the
peoples
whose
seat
of
power
was
on
the
islands
situated
in
the
basin
of
the
baltic
and
the
countries
known
as
scandinavia
the
reader
of
this
volume
will
gain
a
correct
idea
of
the
civilization
of
the
norsemen
of
that
period
the
men
who
came
to
the
gates
of
rome
and
settled
in
britain
gaul
germania
on
the
shores
of
the
mediterranean
and
other
countries
i
begin
the
story
of
my
hero
with
his
birth
accompanied
by
the
characteristic
ceremonies
attending
it
then
i
tell
of
his
fostering
his
education
his
coming
of
age
of
the
precepts
of
wisdom
he
is
taught
of
his
of
the
sacred
ceremony
of
of
his
warlike
expeditions
and
commercial
voyages
of
the
death
and
funeral
of
his
father
of
his
accession
to
rule
and
other
similarly
typical
viking
events
i
speak
in
the
narrative
of
the
dwellings
of
the
people
how
they
lived
of
their
bys
or
burgs
of
the
different
grades
making
up
society
of
their
feasts
of
their
temples
of
their
worship
religious
ceremonies
and
sacrifices
of
funerals
of
amazons
of
athletic
games
of
women
and
maidens
of
love
of
duels
and
sports
of
dress
of
men
and
women
of
marriages
in
a
word
the
book
is
a
picture
of
the
period
the
time
which
i
have
chosen
is
the
epoch
when
the
norsemen
were
most
surely
and
swiftly
sapping
the
power
of
rome
and
engaged
in
colonization
on
the
largest
scale
there
is
not
an
object
a
jewel
either
norse
roman
or
greek
or
a
coin
mentioned
that
has
not
been
found
in
the
present
scandinavia
and
is
not
seen
in
its
museums
and
often
in
great
numbers
the
descriptions
of
customs
interwoven
in
the
narrative
are
derived
from
authentic
records
the
sagas
the
evidence
of
graves
and
of
antiquities
in
general
these
are
more
fully
scientifically
and
technically
described
in
my
work
published
three
years
ago
the
viking
the
descriptions
of
dresses
of
the
women
have
been
most
carefully
drawn
from
the
sagas
and
from
the
handles
of
three
keys
seen
in
the
viking
age
where
three
women
in
full
dress
are
represented
the
materials
and
jewels
with
which
i
have
adorned
them
are
those
found
in
their
graves
the
attire
of
the
men
is
from
the
garments
weapons
and
ornaments
of
that
early
period
found
in
graves
and
bogs
and
from
descriptions
in
the
sagas
the
viking
age
had
hardly
been
published
in
england
when
a
storm
of
protests
and
adverse
criticisms
arose
from
many
quarters
of
that
conservative
country
for
it
is
there
that
the
old
belief
in
the
angle
and
descent
of
the
modern
peoples
is
most
rooted
having
indeed
become
a
religion
with
many
englishmen
i
fully
expected
opposition
to
the
new
views
i
propounded
had
not
my
former
accounts
of
african
travels
been
received
with
incredulity
did
not
the
people
laugh
when
i
told
that
i
had
seen
a
race
of
pigmies
and
been
in
their
villages
did
they
not
doubt
my
descriptions
of
the
great
equatorial
forest
of
gorillas
cannibals
i
was
before
the
time
i
was
too
young
and
these
circumstances
were
against
me
but
then
as
in
the
case
of
the
viking
age
i
found
warm
supporters
and
defenders
in
england
itself
i
knew
that
it
was
bold
on
my
part
to
attack
the
saxon
idol
which
had
been
worshipped
so
long
among
englishmen
and
to
try
to
destroy
the
faith
in
which
they
and
their
fathers
had
believed
was
the
glorious
name
which
the
people
had
been
shouting
for
so
long
even
in
america
to
be
overthrown
what
then
would
become
of
the
sturdy
qualities
claimed
as
inherited
from
the
race
the
qualities
are
there
only
the
name
of
ought
to
be
changed
to
that
of
norse
nothing
but
absolute
conviction
made
me
take
this
bold
step
i
had
never
been
satisfied
with
the
assertions
of
historians
and
could
see
no
evidence
in
their
writings
for
the
conclusions
at
which
they
had
arrived
in
regard
to
the
name
and
as
to
who
were
the
conquerors
and
settlers
of
britain
when
i
travelled
in
the
norselands
to
the
northern
part
of
which
i
gave
the
name
of
the
land
of
the
midnight
sun
a
name
which
has
been
generally
adopted
since
i
became
convinced
that
the
conquerors
of
britain
were
norse
for
while
visiting
their
museums
which
contained
the
norse
antiquities
i
saw
that
these
objects
were
the
same
as
those
called
in
england
by
antiquarians
angle
and
in
france
frankish
these
facts
set
me
thinking
and
ultimately
produced
the
viking
as
soon
as
i
brought
before
the
public
the
evidence
i
had
collected
many
voices
rose
and
exclaimed
woe
to
him
who
tries
to
dispel
our
belief
and
destroy
our
faith
the
world
is
full
of
such
examples
in
the
treatment
of
new
ideas
how
could
i
escape
hostility
when
i
proclaimed
that
the
antiquities
called
in
england
by
archæologists
and
others
and
classified
in
the
museums
as
angle
are
norse
consequently
that
the
ancestors
of
the
people
are
from
the
basin
of
the
baltic
and
present
scandinavia
and
that
it
is
only
there
that
one
sees
the
antiquities
of
a
most
warlike
and
race
of
the
period
of
the
maritime
expeditions
many
apply
the
name
of
to
the
people
who
settled
in
britain
without
knowing
why
except
that
they
had
been
taught
to
believe
it
from
their
school
and
college
days
or
because
the
majority
believe
so
i
maintain
that
the
earlier
england
popularly
placed
at
the
southern
part
of
the
peninsula
of
jutland
is
mythical
that
such
antiquities
pointed
out
as
angle
are
not
found
there
that
the
word
eng
swedish
äng
is
a
common
appellation
all
over
scandinavia
that
england
or
äng
land
to
this
day
is
the
name
given
to
flat
grassy
land
by
the
norse
people
as
it
was
in
earlier
times
the
probability
is
that
the
norsemen
seeing
the
flat
shores
of
britain
on
the
north
sea
called
it
england
or
land
of
meadows
and
the
people
in
the
course
of
time
were
called
as
we
say
mountaineers
in
speaking
of
people
inhabiting
mountainous
regions
some
of
my
critics
took
up
the
question
of
language
the
reason
they
gave
for
not
agreeing
with
me
was
that
the
english
had
the
definite
article
the
and
the
icelandic
did
not
possess
it
this
was
according
to
them
the
most
positive
proof
that
the
earlier
english
people
were
not
norse
one
might
as
well
have
argued
that
the
french
language
was
not
derived
in
great
part
from
the
latin
as
it
has
the
definite
article
and
the
latin
had
not
who
can
ever
tell
when
the
definite
article
was
dropped
or
added
in
those
languages
i
never
expected
that
the
appearance
of
the
viking
age
would
convert
to
my
views
men
who
had
spent
their
lives
in
trying
to
prove
or
in
maintaining
the
belief
in
the
myth
and
who
believed
in
the
diffuse
contradictory
and
often
incomprehensible
writings
of
bede
and
nennius
or
in
the
earlier
english
chronicles
the
authorship
of
which
can
not
be
traced
but
i
have
often
wondered
why
no
one
has
compared
thoroughly
the
norse
archæology
of
that
period
with
that
of
britain
which
is
claimed
as
that
of
the
angle
as
being
the
early
settlers
of
britain
and
the
only
reason
i
could
discover
that
anyone
had
for
calling
these
antiquities
by
those
names
was
because
of
blind
confidence
that
these
settlers
were
what
the
historians
claimed
them
to
be
those
who
cling
to
the
belief
point
to
here
and
there
a
few
graves
in
the
ancient
friesland
similar
to
those
found
in
england
as
a
proof
that
the
earlier
settlers
of
britain
did
not
come
from
the
baltic
as
if
it
were
possible
that
none
of
these
norsemen
who
used
to
visit
friesland
as
far
back
as
before
the
time
of
tacitus
could
have
failed
to
die
there
during
several
centuries
they
forget
also
that
the
romans
never
mentioned
the
people
of
that
country
as
on
the
contrary
the
maritime
tribes
that
harassed
them
were
living
on
the
most
northern
shores
of
the
the
ocean
the
antiquities
left
by
these
tribes
are
those
that
must
give
us
light
on
the
subject
one
might
just
as
well
assert
one
thousand
years
from
now
that
the
people
of
english
descent
of
the
present
time
living
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
were
the
ones
that
held
sway
over
india
because
they
were
nearer
than
england
to
india
or
that
the
solitary
graves
or
little
english
cemeteries
found
between
england
and
india
were
those
of
the
people
who
governed
india
a
little
more
research
would
prove
to
them
that
the
great
seat
of
power
was
in
england
we
learn
from
archæology
where
egypt
greece
rome
and
many
other
fallen
empires
held
their
sway
so
we
may
know
from
the
traces
left
where
the
norsemen
held
theirs
also
and
that
nowhere
did
they
hold
it
more
firmly
than
in
britain
the
controversy
to
me
seems
very
plain
i
have
maintained
in
the
viking
age
and
shall
continue
to
do
so
until
i
am
shown
to
be
mistaken
that
it
is
in
the
basin
of
the
baltic
and
in
the
norselands
that
we
see
incontestable
proofs
as
to
who
were
the
people
whom
the
romans
called
first
sueones
and
then
saxons
as
shown
by
the
tens
of
thousands
of
graves
of
that
period
still
existing
that
these
graves
and
their
antiquities
are
the
same
and
of
the
same
type
as
those
of
a
similar
period
in
england
that
in
these
norse
graves
a
great
many
roman
coins
of
gold
and
silver
and
many
roman
and
greek
objects
are
found
showing
that
these
people
had
intercourse
with
rome
greece
and
the
mediterranean
nay
do
not
the
coins
antedating
the
roman
empire
when
patrician
families
of
rome
coined
their
own
money
tell
the
tale
of
how
early
norsemen
went
into
the
mediterranean
are
not
norse
graves
often
seen
on
its
shores
by
the
side
of
the
graves
of
the
etruscans
i
also
maintain
that
neither
at
the
mouth
of
the
elbe
nor
anywhere
else
out
of
the
norselands
do
we
see
the
remains
of
a
dense
warlike
and
maritime
population
which
has
left
traces
in
the
number
of
its
graves
far
greater
than
has
rome
itself
how
could
the
host
miscalled
saxon
by
the
later
romans
which
overran
europe
till
the
downfall
of
the
empire
for
four
centuries
avoid
leaving
such
traces
their
population
must
have
been
very
dense
in
order
to
allow
them
to
send
forth
such
vast
fleets
to
fight
and
conquer
the
romans
how
is
it
that
the
saxons
whom
we
know
as
saxons
were
not
a
people
in
the
time
of
charlemagne
as
we
know
they
were
not
simply
because
they
never
had
been
how
is
it
that
in
charlemagne
s
time
on
the
other
hand
the
sueones
who
must
have
been
the
saxons
of
the
later
romans
were
dreaded
by
him
as
powerful
at
sea
just
as
they
are
described
by
tacitus
have
not
the
races
which
have
disappeared
in
america
or
elsewhere
left
traces
and
must
we
make
an
exception
of
the
saxons
of
the
romans
this
would
be
against
the
evidence
of
everything
before
us
it
is
by
comparing
the
graves
and
antiquities
of
the
norselands
with
those
of
england
that
we
have
the
proof
that
the
early
settlers
of
britain
were
norsemen
the
scene
in
this
volume
of
ivar
going
to
visit
his
kinsmen
on
the
banks
of
the
river
cam
in
england
has
been
described
because
there
is
a
cemetery
there
whose
antiquities
show
its
norse
origin
and
the
roman
coins
buried
with
them
of
trajanus
of
hadrianus
faustina
wife
of
antoninus
pius
marcus
aurelius
of
maximianus
show
how
early
norse
settlements
began
what
are
the
objects
found
in
that
cemetery
and
described
in
the
beautiful
work
of
the
honorable
neville
saxon
obsequies
illustrated
by
ornaments
and
weapons
discovered
in
a
cemetery
near
little
wilbraham
cambridgeshire
printed
in
swords
axes
umbos
cinerary
urns
with
burned
bones
wooden
buckets
with
bronze
hoops
bronze
tweezers
spear
and
arrow
heads
of
iron
ear
picks
iron
knives
iron
shears
brooches
beads
of
glass
and
other
material
fired
by
cremation
i
will
quote
the
words
of
neville
himself
that
so
large
a
number
of
urns
containing
human
remains
should
have
been
discovered
in
conjunction
with
skeletons
affords
a
remarkably
satisfactory
confirmation
of
the
coexistence
of
these
two
modes
of
burial
my
experience
enables
me
to
state
with
confidence
that
the
urns
now
discovered
differ
entirely
from
any
roman
i
had
before
encountered
and
resemble
closely
those
usually
met
with
in
if
the
reader
opens
the
viking
age
and
looks
over
its
thirteen
hundred
and
sixty
illustrations
he
will
see
the
same
objects
as
those
described
and
illustrated
by
neville
and
the
same
descriptions
of
graves
it
is
time
that
the
views
of
antiquarians
and
historians
of
the
old
school
should
be
entirely
set
aside
or
remodelled
and
that
the
old
england
placed
popularly
as
existing
in
the
southern
part
of
the
peninsula
of
jutland
and
comprising
a
territory
of
a
few
square
miles
be
considered
a
myth
that
had
no
reality
except
in
the
brain
of
its
inventors
when
i
say
that
the
antiquities
found
in
england
are
the
same
and
of
the
same
type
as
those
found
in
the
norselands
i
call
this
a
fact
and
not
a
theory
and
when
i
say
also
that
these
are
not
found
in
the
saxon
lands
i
call
this
a
fact
and
not
a
theory
when
i
say
that
the
antiquities
found
in
england
are
not
found
in
the
earlier
england
of
the
historian
i
call
this
a
fact
and
not
a
theory
and
if
i
am
wrong
it
can
be
easily
disproved
but
let
me
add
that
after
the
appearance
of
the
viking
age
everybody
was
far
from
being
against
me
in
england
i
found
there
many
adherents
to
my
views
and
some
even
went
so
far
as
to
write
to
me
that
after
the
publication
of
the
work
and
upon
seeing
its
illustrations
they
did
not
believe
that
stonehenge
was
druidical
but
was
simply
of
norse
origin
for
there
were
many
graves
containing
viking
remains
in
the
country
round
about
the
roman
records
are
correct
no
countries
but
the
islands
of
the
baltic
and
scandinavia
correspond
to
their
description
it
is
there
that
we
find
a
great
number
of
roman
objects
coins
are
there
found
from
the
time
of
the
foundation
of
the
of
augustus
to
of
tiberius
claudius
then
in
increased
number
those
of
nero
vitellius
vespasian
of
titus
in
still
greater
number
those
of
trajan
antoninus
pius
of
faustina
the
elder
wife
of
antoninus
pius
of
marcus
aurelius
of
faustina
his
wife
of
commodus
then
in
decreasing
quantities
the
coins
of
the
subsequent
emperors
by
the
side
of
these
coins
and
other
roman
objects
are
norse
objects
and
these
norse
objects
are
as
i
have
said
similar
to
those
found
in
the
england
of
a
corresponding
period
the
mode
of
burial
is
also
identical
in
both
countries
these
facts
tell
plainly
who
were
the
people
who
settled
in
britain
before
and
after
the
time
of
ivar
the
viking
and
of
the
roman
occupation
while
the
controversy
was
going
on
in
england
knowing
the
receptive
and
impartial
mind
of
gladstone
and
having
been
several
times
the
recipient
in
years
past
of
his
kind
hospitality
and
remembering
the
interest
he
had
taken
in
my
african
travels
i
took
the
liberty
of
addressing
to
him
a
request
for
his
opinion
in
regard
to
the
position
i
had
taken
gladstone
who
was
then
in
oxford
for
the
purpose
of
delivering
a
lecture
on
homer
replied
the
same
day
i
append
his
letter
dear
du
chaillu
you
have
done
me
great
honor
by
appealing
to
me
but
i
fear
your
appeal
is
to
a
person
prepossessed
and
ignorant
my
prepossessions
are
on
your
side
but
i
have
not
yet
been
able
although
very
desirous
to
examine
the
argument
on
your
side
as
it
deserves
nor
that
of
your
adversaries
i
am
a
man
of
blood
only
half
highland
and
half
lowland
near
the
border
a
branch
of
my
family
settled
in
scandinavia
in
the
first
half
i
think
of
the
seventeenth
century
when
i
have
been
in
norway
or
denmark
or
among
scandinavians
i
have
felt
something
like
a
cry
of
nature
from
within
asserting
credibly
or
otherwise
my
nearness
to
them
in
norway
i
have
never
felt
as
if
in
a
foreign
country
and
this
i
have
learned
is
a
very
common
experience
with
british
travellers
the
love
of
freedom
in
combination
with
settled
order
which
we
hope
is
characteristic
of
this
country
is
i
apprehend
markedly
characteristic
of
norway
and
of
denmark
i
have
not
spoken
of
sweden
simply
because
i
have
not
been
there
the
ethnography
of
northern
and
insular
scotland
down
even
to
the
isle
of
man
and
the
history
seem
to
show
a
very
broad
and
durable
connection
still
i
can
not
call
these
more
than
feeble
generalities
i
earnestly
hope
when
i
am
a
little
more
free
that
i
may
be
able
to
get
some
real
hold
of
the
subject
i
think
a
good
deal
of
the
argument
suggested
by
our
fishing
population
and
by
the
persistency
with
which
in
some
districts
scandinavian
terminations
have
been
preserved

hjorvard
and
gotland
the
mariner
sailing
in
the
baltic
as
he
skirts
the
shores
of
gotland
sees
on
a
promontory
of
that
island
several
large
cairns
and
mounds
overlooking
the
sea
and
the
country
that
surrounds
them
this
promontory
was
the
burial
place
of
a
family
of
great
vikings
and
rulers
who
held
sway
over
the
whole
island
a
few
centuries
before
and
after
our
era
among
the
most
conspicuous
cairns
two
are
pointed
out
to
the
stranger
those
of
hjorvard
and
his
son
ivar
the
hero
of
the
present
narrative
the
events
of
which
i
am
going
to
speak
to
you
relate
to
them
and
to
what
happened
during
their
lives
towards
the
latter
end
of
the
third
and
the
beginning
of
the
fourth
century
between
the
years
and
or
about
sixteen
hundred
years
ago
hjorvard
the
wide
spreading
so
called
on
account
of
the
widely
extended
maritime
expeditions
he
had
undertaken
was
one
of
the
most
renowned
vikings
of
his
time
in
all
his
expeditions
he
had
been
successful
and
always
victorious
in
his
battles
the
roman
fleets
had
never
dared
to
attack
him
as
he
sailed
with
his
numerous
ships
along
the
coasts
of
their
wide
empire
to
make
war
upon
the
different
countries
over
which
they
held
dominion
hjorvard
s
ancestors
by
the
side
of
whom
he
now
lies
buried
had
been
great
warriors
and
men
like
himself
they
had
sailed
from
the
baltic
to
the
caspian
sea
by
the
present
gulf
of
finland
and
also
westward
along
the
coast
of
friesland
gaul
britain
and
as
far
south
as
the
mediterranean
the
ships
used
by
them
in
their
river
expeditions
or
along
the
coast
during
the
summer
months
were
unlike
those
of
the
romans
and
were
much
admired
by
them
even
in
the
first
century
the
romans
feared
these
men
of
the
north
on
account
of
the
great
fleets
they
possessed
and
placed
them
as
living
on
the
most
northern
shores
of
the
sea
in
the
very
ocean
itself
they
called
them
sueones
and
all
they
knew
of
their
country
was
what
these
sueones
told
them
about
it
for
the
baltic
was
an
unknown
sea
to
the
romans
hjorvard
was
of
high
lineage
for
he
was
descended
from
odin
and
he
belonged
to
that
branch
of
the
family
of
odin
called
ynglingar
which
ruled
over
svithjod
a
realm
that
embraced
a
great
part
of
the
present
sweden
sigrlin
his
wife
was
a
very
handsome
woman
and
possessed
all
the
accomplishments
belonging
to
women
of
her
high
rank
she
was
also
of
odin
s
kin
was
a
direct
descendant
of
skjöld
the
norse
word
for
shield
one
of
the
sons
of
odin
from
whom
the
skjöldungar
are
descended
the
skjöldungar
ruled
over
that
part
of
the
land
which
is
called
denmark
but
which
was
then
called
gotland
her
father
was
called
halfdan
and
resided
at
hleidra
not
far
from
where
copenhagen
stands
and
was
one
of
the
great
rulers
of
the
north
not
far
from
the
cairns
and
mounds
just
mentioned
was
dampstadir
the
head
by
or
burg
the
residence
of
hjorvard
and
of
the
rulers
of
gotland
from
this
place
a
long
panorama
of
coast
and
land
could
be
seen
and
the
eye
lost
itself
in
the
dim
horizon
of
the
sea
there
hjorvard
lived
in
great
splendor
the
buildings
which
made
up
dampstadir
were
among
the
finest
of
the
northern
lands
they
were
of
different
sizes
and
varied
architecture
and
like
all
the
structures
of
those
days
in
the
north
were
entirely
of
wood
they
were
roofed
with
shingles
heavily
tarred
their
dark
color
contrasting
pleasantly
with
that
of
the
log
walls
of
the
houses
all
the
numerous
buildings
formed
a
vast
quadrangle
enclosing
a
large
plot
of
grass
called
tun
or
town
from
the
centre
of
the
square
the
sight
was
extremely
beautiful
and
picturesque
for
there
were
not
two
buildings
of
the
same
appearance
or
size
some
were
finer
than
others
of
course
but
all
were
quaint
from
their
roofs
and
sides
gargoyles
representing
heads
of
horses
or
dragons
and
other
wild
beasts
stuck
out
boldly
into
the
air
from
every
side
or
looked
with
heads
inclined
downward
towards
the
ground
there
were
a
few
houses
with
towers
called
lofts
in
these
towers
were
a
number
of
and
from
their
tops
in
time
of
war
a
sharp
lookout
was
kept
for
the
enemy
s
vessels
many
buildings
were
also
used
as
before
the
doors
of
many
houses
were
porches
ornamented
with
carvings
while
others
had
belfries
and
dark
piazzas
with
stairs
leading
to
them
their
walls
of
hard
logs
seeming
to
defy
the
ravages
of
time
for
many
of
them
at
that
time
even
dated
centuries
back
some
were
specially
for
the
use
of
the
women
members
of
the
family
of
hjorvard
and
for
their
household
for
it
was
customary
for
women
to
have
their
skemmas
or
bowers
all
to
themselves
there
they
received
their
friends
and
spent
their
time
in
sewing
and
embroidering
there
were
several
festive
halls
for
use
during
the
winter
long
fires
ran
along
the
centre
of
these
the
smoke
escaping
through
openings
in
the
roof
which
openings
could
be
closed
when
necessary
along
the
walls
ran
long
benches
and
tables
were
set
in
front
of
them
the
light
came
in
through
windows
instead
of
glass
the
transparent
membrane
enclosing
the
calf
was
stretched
over
what
were
called
the
the
life
of
hjorvard
was
very
simple
at
the
principal
or
day
meal
sigrlin
sat
on
the
left
hand
of
her
husband
the
seats
next
to
this
on
both
sides
being
the
most
dignified
for
men
and
women
while
the
farthest
ones
near
the
door
were
the
least
so
the
most
oldest
and
wisest
it
was
the
custom
for
rulers
to
have
wise
men
with
them
who
knew
the
ancient
examples
and
customs
of
their
on
the
northern
high
seat
called
the
lower
high
seat
opposite
that
of
hjorvard
on
whose
right
hand
were
women
the
men
being
on
his
left
it
was
also
the
custom
for
chiefs
to
carry
the
ale
over
the
fire
and
drink
to
the
man
opposite
the
high
seat
and
it
was
thought
to
be
a
great
honor
to
be
toasted
by
the
host
the
most
imposing
and
striking
of
all
the
structures
along
that
enormous
square
was
the
great
banqueting
hall
of
all
the
buildings
this
was
the
one
in
which
the
chiefs
and
rulers
took
the
greatest
pride
for
it
was
there
that
they
received
their
most
honored
guests
and
gave
their
most
splendid
feasts
the
banqueting
hall
at
dampstadir
was
ranked
the
sixth
for
beauty
and
grandeur
in
the
land
of
the
vikings
and
was
very
old
two
superb
doors
at
the
two
ends
led
into
the
interior
the
or
jambs
of
these
were
of
solid
oak
about
two
and
a
half
feet
wide
and
several
inches
thick
these
were
adorned
with
beautiful
carvings
representing
scenes
belonging
to
the
religious
history
of
the
race
and
varying
greatly
in
depth
so
as
to
give
a
fine
artistic
effect
of
light
and
shade
the
doors
themselves
were
of
solid
oak
also
and
were
ornamented
with
intricate
designs
made
with
flat
iron
bands
of
exquisite
beauty
and
perfect
gems
of
art
a
massive
gold
knocker
adorned
each
door
by
one
door
the
women
entered
by
the
other
the
men
the
inside
of
this
banqueting
hall
was
a
sight
not
to
be
soon
forgotten
the
first
artists
and
of
the
north
had
been
employed
and
had
shown
wonderful
skill
in
the
elaboration
and
grouping
of
their
scenes
represented
including
many
of
the
deeds
and
expeditions
of
hjorvard
s
ancestors
the
carvings
were
considered
so
beautiful
that
even
the
finest
tapestry
was
not
hung
over
them
and
the
wood
itself
had
become
richly
dark
during
the
centuries
that
had
elapsed
since
the
hall
had
been
built
all
along
the
walls
hung
shields
of
variegated
designs
and
bright
colors
ornamented
with
gold
and
silver
overlapping
each
other
and
of
course
adding
much
to
the
gorgeousness
of
the
spectacle
as
was
customary
this
hall
had
been
built
east
and
west
the
long
walls
running
north
and
south
along
the
latter
were
the
benches
for
the
guests
and
just
in
the
middle
of
them
were
the
two
high
seats
facing
each
other
the
most
important
bench
ran
along
the
northern
walls
and
there
the
great
high
seat
the
more
honored
of
the
two
stood
facing
the
sun
it
was
for
the
master
of
the
house
and
to
be
placed
on
the
high
seat
opposite
was
the
greatest
honor
that
could
be
shown
to
any
guest
consequently
this
seat
was
always
assigned
to
the
most
prominent
men
the
nearer
the
places
on
the
benches
assigned
to
any
one
were
to
the
high
seat
the
greater
the
honor
the
places
farther
away
near
the
door
being
the
lowest
these
two
high
seats
were
beautifully
carved
with
arms
on
both
sides
and
two
pillars
which
were
both
painted
and
ornamented
with
carving
representing
historical
subjects
the
weapons
of
hjorvard
hung
above
his
high
sax
or
sword
his
best
sword
also
his
shield
his
brynja
or
and
helmet
of
gold
his
sword
called
hrotti
was
a
magnificent
weapon
the
hilt
was
all
ornamented
with
gold
and
so
was
the
scabbard
the
blade
was
of
most
exquisite
damascened
workmanship
this
sword
was
in
its
sheath
which
was
wrapped
with
bands
called
peace
bands
there
was
profound
peace
over
the
land
at
the
time
we
are
speaking
no
one
but
hjorvard
could
unloose
them
for
these
were
holy
and
it
was
only
when
war
had
been
declared
that
it
could
be
done
mementos
of
the
expeditions
of
hjorvard
and
of
his
forefathers
were
scattered
here
and
there
treasured
as
heirlooms
along
the
walls
hung
several
roman
swords
with
latin
inscriptions
upon
them
which
had
been
in
the
family
for
two
hundred
years
there
were
roman
statuettes
bronze
vessels
and
various
other
bronze
objects
and
a
collection
of
roman
coins
of
every
emperor
from
the
time
of
augustus
the
first
roman
emperor
to
the
time
of
hjorvard
among
the
gems
of
art
were
lovely
grecian
cups
bowls
and
drinking
horns
of
glass
some
of
the
glass
cups
and
bowls
adorned
with
charming
paintings
representing
rural
scenes
with
wild
beasts
lions
bulls
birds
of
variegated
colors
and
even
men
boxing
with
boxing
gloves
all
looking
as
fresh
as
the
day
they
were
painted
at
the
foot
of
dampstadir
was
a
beautiful
bay
where
the
ships
of
hjorvard
lay
at
anchor
while
on
its
shores
were
numerous
sheds
under
which
stood
many
of
the
ships
which
were
thus
protected
from
the
weather
there
were
also
building
yards
where
busy
carpenters
were
always
at
work
constructing
or
repairing
vessels
the
finest
ships
to
be
seen
there
were
the
drekis
or
these
were
the
largest
and
most
formidable
of
all
warships
and
derived
their
names
from
the
fact
that
their
prows
and
sterns
were
ornamented
with
the
head
or
tail
of
one
or
more
dragons
some
were
covered
with
sheets
of
solid
gold
which
gave
a
superb
appearance
to
the
ships
especially
when
the
sun
shone
upon
their
sides
many
of
these
drekis
could
carry
a
crew
of
from
five
hundred
to
seven
hundred
men
besides
the
there
were
other
called
skeids
snekkjas
skutas
buzas
karfi
ask
and
also
many
provision
ships
which
followed
the
fleets
on
their
expeditions
the
skeid
was
a
formidable
almost
equal
in
power
to
the
a
very
fast
sailer
which
carried
two
hundred
and
forty
men
or
more
the
snekkja
was
a
smaller
ship
of
the
same
general
description
the
skutta
was
a
smaller
craft
still
which
could
be
manœuvred
very
quickly
it
was
generally
used
for
boarding
other
ships
the
upper
part
of
its
gunwale
being
so
built
that
warriors
could
more
easily
leap
upon
other
vessels
all
these
vessels
small
or
large
had
only
one
mast
among
these
ships
could
be
seen
some
of
the
type
which
has
been
described
by
tacitus
with
no
mast
and
entirely
propelled
by
oars
they
were
very
sharp
pointed
at
both
ends
much
like
the
of
about
eighty
feet
long
and
in
the
widest
part
ten
or
eleven
feet
broad
with
fifteen
or
sixteen
benches
about
three
feet
apart
these
boats
were
propelled
by
thirty
or
oars
varying
somewhat
in
length
and
of
an
average
of
about
twelve
feet
two
men
and
sometimes
three
pulled
each
oar
and
a
man
with
a
shield
protected
the
oarsmen
on
each
outer
side
the
were
fastened
to
the
gunwales
with
bast
ropes
and
were
adorned
with
graceful
carved
designs
no
two
being
alike
on
the
side
at
the
stern
was
the
rudder
resembling
a
large
broad
oar
they
were
so
shaped
that
they
could
be
rowed
in
either
direction
at
the
time
of
which
we
are
speaking
this
model
of
naval
architecture
was
fast
going
out
of
fashion
and
sailing
vessels
exclusively
were
coming
into
general
use
all
the
vessels
were
of
oak
that
is
the
planks
overlapped
each
other
and
were
made
fast
together
by
large
iron
bolts
the
island
of
gotland
over
which
hjorvard
ruled
had
a
very
dense
population
and
was
on
account
of
its
size
and
geographical
position
a
great
emporium
of
commerce
and
with
its
war
and
trading
ships
occupied
at
this
time
about
the
same
position
as
the
england
of
our
days
its
inhabitants
were
wealthy
and
traded
extensively
as
their
fathers
had
done
with
provinces
of
rome
with
greece
and
the
countries
round
the
caspian
the
black
and
the
mediterranean
seas
from
such
distant
lands
as
these
they
brought
superb

beautiful
objects
of
leather
embroidered
gold
and
silver

material
for

chapter
ii
the
viking
land
and
the
vikings
at
the
period
of
which
i
write
the
land
of
the
vikings
embraced
the
islands
of
the
baltic
and
those
of
the
small
and
the
great
belt
leading
into
that
sea
the
country
known
as
scandinavia
which
embraces
the
large
peninsula
of
sweden
and
norway
and
the
small
peninsula
of
jutland
the
whole
land
was
virtually
surrounded
by
sea
great
fortifications
had
been
built
on
the
southern
peninsula
of
jutland
between
the
two
fjords
which
enter
it
from
opposite
sides
so
that
no
incursion
could
take
place
from
the
land
to
the
south
the
large
islands
especially
were
seats
of
great
maritime
power
and
wealth
all
the
tribes
were
of
a
common
origin
and
kindred
they
had
the
same
customs
and
religion
practised
the
same
burial
rites
intermarried
and
spoke
the
same
language
which
was
called
the
norranean
tongue
these
vikings
as
we
have
seen
were
quite
isolated
from
central
and
western
europe
and
formed
a
world
of
their
own
having
much
intercourse
with
the
country
forming
the
present
russia
between
them
and
rome
stood
the
inaccessible
swamps
and
forests
of
germania
inhabited
by
wild
and
barbaric
tribes
great
indeed
was
the
contrast
that
existed
between
the
vikings
and
the
tribes
of
germania
all
these
tribes
called
themselves
norsemen
or
northmen
they
were
intensely
warlike
and
had
been
people
from
immemorial
time
the
deeds
done
on
the
sea
in
ages
could
only
be
seen
or
remembered
by
graves
made
venerable
by
the
centuries
that
had
passed
over
them
or
by
the
large
tracings
deeply
engraved
upon
the
rocks
seen
to
this
day
representing
raids
and
invasions
like
the
hieroglyphics
of
egypt
they
were
the
mementos
of
a
great
past
forever
forgotten
the
norsemen
of
our
period
used
only
weapons
of
iron
those
of
bronze
had
been
given
up
centuries
before
but
they
were
proud
of
that
former
civilization
and
boasted
that
at
that
remote
time
no
one
excelled
their
ancestors
in
the
art
of
manufacturing
arms
of
boast
that
has
not
been
made
vain
to
this
day
long
even
before
the
time
of
hjorvard
the
country
was
unable
to
support
its
population
and
the
people
had
in
consequence
become
more
and
more
aggressive
towards
the
inhabitants
of
countries
to
the
west
of
them
as
years
passed
away
through
their
voyages
during
the
preceding
generations
and
during
their
own
times
they
had
become
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
countries
and
rivers
of
friesland
gaul
britain
and
other
countries
and
had
been
seeking
new
homes
there
their
fleets
swarmed
over
every
sea
and
no
country
was
exempt
from
their
attacks
year
after
year
an
innumerable
irresistible
and
apparently
inexhaustible
host
they
poured
over
western
europe
and
had
become
complete
masters
of
the
sea
fleet
after
fleet
returned
home
laden
with
roman
spoils
of
all
kinds
these
expeditions
were
undertaken
by
chiefs
living
in
very
different
regions
of
the
country
and
the
people
flocked
with
their
ships
from
every
part
of
the
land
to
enroll
themselves
under
their
standards
when
they
announced
that
they
were
ready
to
make
war
on
the
roman
world
the
ever
victorious
norsemen
called
themselves
the
chosen
people
of
the
gods
the
loved
ones
of
odin
and
considering
themselves
the
chosen
they
never
tried
to
convert
other
nations
like
the
jews
of
old
they
despised
every
other
religion
wherever
they
obtained
a
foothold
they
held
the
land
and
people
under
an
iron
sway
death
had
no
terror
for
them
valhalla
where
odin
dwelt
was
to
be
their
future
abode
they
believed
also
in
frey
njord
thor
freya
and
in
other
gods
and
goddesses
there
were
many
conditions
of
men
in
the
great
viking
s
land
different
grades
of
society
built
up
the
social
structure
the
whole
country
was
divided
into
herads
forming
separate
realms
some
had
a
much
larger
tract
of
territory
than
others
and
were
more
powerful
most
of
the
estates
composing
them
were
inherited
by
laws
of
primogeniture
or
entail
over
each
herad
ruled
a
hersir
which
was
the
highest
hereditary
dignity
in
the
land
the
title
of
drott
lord
or
high
priest
which
had
come
down
from
odin
s
time
had
disappeared
and
given
place
to
that
of
hersir
the
name
of
king
was
yet
unknown
each
herad
had
a
where
the
yearly
sacrifices
for
all
the
people
were
made
the
hersir
was
the
head
of
the
community
he
was
the
leader
in

and
the
administrator
of
justice
he
was
the
high
priest
in
regard
to
worship
and
as
such
took
care
of
the
temple
and
superintended
the
sacrifices
and
other
religious
ceremonies
he
held
the
farms
and

belonging
to
the
temple
in

received
a
temple
tax
from
every
man
for
its
maintenance

took

several
times
during

year
through
his
position

in
order
to
rule
over
more
lands

the
hersir

was
generally
of
odin

kin
and
their
children
were
wrapped
in

hair
was

their
cheeks
bright
and
healthy
and
their
eyes
as
keen
as
those

the
hersir

daughters
were
their
hands
and
arms
were
soft
their
hearts
lighter
and
their

whiter
than
pure

with
all
the
accomplishments

when
they

bridal
linen
according
to
the
custom
of
people
and
walked
under
a
bridal
veil
next
in
rank
to
the
hersir
were
the
haulds
the
highest
class
of
dwellers
in
the
land
they
lived
on
the
estates
that
had
descended
to
them
for
generations
as
a
body
of
men
they
were
the
power
of
the
land
and
no

could
ever
rule
without

their

were
dressed
in

also
when
they
married
after
the
hauld
came
another
class
of

were
also
entailed
these

throve
well
on
the

made
barns
and

and
drove
the

their
daughters
carried
keys
hanging
at

and
helped
their
mothers
when
they
married
they
too
were
allowed
to
wear
white
like
the
daughters
of
hersirs
and
haulds
to
set
up
a
household
and
sleep
under
linen
they
divided
wealth
with
their
husbands
there
was
another
class
of
freemen
who
rented
lands
for
they
had
no
estate
the
doors
of
the
houses
of
these
were
always
ajar
there
was
a
fire
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
a
lumpy
loaf
heavy
and
thick
was
on
the
trencher
broth
in
a

considered
the
choicest

were
often

existed
their
doors
were
also
always
ajar
husband
and

were
always
busy
with
their
work
his
beard
was
trimmed
his
hair
lay
on
his
forehead
his

was
tight
his
wife
twirled
a
distaff
stretched
out
her
arms
and
made
cloth
she
wore
a
on
her

to
show
that
she
was
no
longer
a
maiden
a
kerchief
on
her
neck
and
brooches
fastening
the
folds
of
the
dress
on
the
shoulders
then
came
the
slave
distinct
from
all
dressed
always
in
thick
white
woollen
stuff
with
his
hair
cropped
close
in
contrast
to
the
long
hair
worn
by
the

such
was
his
badge
of

he
was

foreign
birth

origin
he
had
been
captured
in
war
or
bought
at
a
or
at
a
fair
in
distant
lands
and
generations
of
slavery
had
degraded
him
nevertheless
he
also
throve
well
in
the
land
but
the
wrinkled
skin
and
crooked
knuckles
the
thick
fingers
the
ugly
face
the
bent
back
the
long
heels
told
the
tale
of
his
slavery
and
of
that
of
his

his
life
was
passed
in
trying
to
learn
how
much
he
could

chapter
iii
hjorvard
consults
the
oracle
there
was
no
nobler
or
bolder
heart
than
that
of
hjorvard
he
had
begun
his
life
of
warfare
when
fifteen
years
old
many
in
the
land
said
that
the
renown
he
had
gained
was
the
result
of
folly
and
hardihood
others
thought
that
he
enjoyed
his
life
in
doing
deeds
of
honor
he
had
won
fame
and
travelled
through
nine
different
countries
like
all
the
great
hersirs
he
had
with
him
twelve
champions
who
formed
his
and
had
come
from
every
part
of
the
northern
lands
some
from
the
shores
of
present
norway
others
from
the
islands
of
the
baltic
and
two
from
svithjod
the
bravest
men
wanted
to
serve
him
for
he
was
lucky
in
war
a
genial
and
convivial
leader
and
most
generous
with
his
gold
all
the
champions
of
hjorvard
were
berserks
and
to
be
considered
the
foremost
champion
was
the
ambition
of
every
warrior
to
attain
this
proud
position
was
no
easy
task
among
so
many
men
in
the
land
who
were
equally
brave
and
perfectly
reckless
of
their
lives
and
who
were
thoroughly
skilled
in
the
handling
of
weapons
and
all
kinds
of
athletic
games
after
such
a
reputation
had
been
acquired
the
champion
had
either
to
challenge
or
be
challenged
by
those
who
were
envious
of
him
or
thought
themselves
more
than
his
equal
and
these
contests
or
trials
of
strength
and
skill
generally
took
place
before
a
large
assembly
of
people
the
champions
of
hjorvard
in
time
of
peace
often
went
round
the
country
and
challenged
men
specially
famous
for
their
prowess
berserks
despised
and
all
weapons
of
defence
such
as
shields
and
helmets
they
often
even
fought
without
clothing
and
could
lash
themselves
into
such
a
state
of
frenzy
that
they
lost
all
control
over
themselves
often
this
fury
or
berserk
rage
came
upon
them
without
cause
and
seized
them
suddenly
when
they
would
bite
their
weapons
gnash
their
teeth
wrestle
with
trees
and
rocks
and
become
reckless
of
every
danger
when
in
sight
of
their
foes
they
rushed
to
the
attack
with
an
indescribable
fury
and
when
in
conflict
with
other
berserks
the
fight
was
deadly
when
the
berserk
fury
seized
them
at
home
they
would
go
out
through
fear
of
fighting
with
their
friends
and
wrestle
with
rocks
and
trees
hjorvard
had
made
very
stringent
rules
for
his
champions
and
warriors
no
man
could
come
under
his
standard
who
feared
death
or
uttered
words
of
fright
when
in
danger
or
groaned
when
he
received
the
worst
wounds
in
battle
nor
could
these
wounds
themselves
be
dressed
until
the
day
after
they
had
been
received
no
man
was
allowed
to
have
a
sword
longer
than
two
feet
the
swords
and
saxes
of
hjorvard
s
men
were
heavier
than
those
of
others
so
that
when
they
struck
a
blow
it
might
be
most
telling
it
was
always
the
custom
of
hjorvard
to
lie
with
his
ships
before
promontories
so
that
these
might
be
seen
by
every
one
on
none
of
his
vessels
were
tents
put
up
to
protect
him
or
his
men
from
the
weather
they
never
reefed
a
sail
during
a
storm
and
he
had
never
more
than
one
hundred
and
twenty
champions
on
board
of
his
own
ship
he
had
the
honor
of
chivalry
he
bade
his
warriors
not
to
break
men
s
spirit
by
putting
them
in
fetters
nor
to
do
any
harm
to
any
man
s
wife
and
ordered
that
every
maid
should
be
bought
with
dowry
and
with
the
consent
of
her
father
and
that
women
and
their
children
should
not
be
captured
victory
always
followed
him
so
that
great
champions
and
berserks
of
the
land
flocked
to
his
standards
when
he
undertook
a
warlike
expedition
led
by
him
they
felt
sure
of
victory
in
advance
no
man
less
than
eighteen
years
old
or
more
than
fifty
could
follow
him
in
warfare
all
his
warriors
had
to
have
strength
enough
to
lift
a
large
stone
that
stood
near
his
residence
the
chiefs
who
resided
in
gotland
owed
him
allegiance
and
all
were
his
kinsmen
and
all
those
under
him
had
by
law
to
furnish
him
a
certain
number
of
ships
and
warriors
when
needed
during
his
life
he
had
subdued
several
chiefs
on
the
southern
shores
of
the
baltic
and
those
paid
him
tribute
willingly
for
he
was
not
grasping
and
used
his
power
with
moderation
but
all
had
to
submit
once
to
the
humiliating
ceremony
of
letting
him
put
his
foot
on
their
necks
in
acknowledgment
of
being
his
vassals
though
hjorvard
and
sigrlin
had
been
married
a
certain
number
of
years
no
child
had
been
born
to
them
so
the
hersir
of
gotland
made
up
his
mind
to
go
to
svithjod
the
most
powerful
realm
of
the
viking
lands
and
to
upsalir
the
most
sacred
of
all
the
places
of
the
north
to
consult
the
gods
and
see
if
he
could
learn
the
decrees
of
fate
hjorvard
assembled
a
large
fleet
and
after
bidding
farewell
to
sigrlin
who
accompanied
him
to
his
ship
he
sailed
directly
for
the
fjord
at
the
head
of
which
is
lake
malar
the
wind
was
good
and
the
second
day
they
came
in
sight
of
land
here
fortified
towers
and
catapults
in
sight
of
each
other
guarded
the
narrow
arm
of
the
sea
on
both
sides
whence
a
storm
of
missiles
could
be
thrown
on
the
vessels
of
an
invading
host
and
in
war
times
chains
were
laid
across
there
preventing
the
sudden
ascent
of
ships
as
the
moon
shone
brightly
that
night
they
continued
their
voyage
borne
on
by
a
strong
and
favorable
breeze
in
due
course
of
time
they
came
to
the
narrowest
part
pf
the
fjord
called
waxholm
the
men
shouted
as
they
sailed
past
the
fortifications
viewing
which
they
said
to
each
other
no
wonder
that
upsalir
is
but
the
white
peace
shields
were
at
the
mastheads
for
there
had
been
peace
between
gotland
and
svithjod
for
many
a
year
as
the
fleet
approached
lake
malar
the
wind
became
very
light
and
the
crews
had
to
take
to
their
oars
three
men
were
on
each
these
pulled
the
oars
so
hard
that
their
bodies
seemed
at
times
to
be
bent
in
two
farther
on
they
came
to
the
head
of
the
fjord
and
sailed
amidst
the
several
islands
which
are
in
the
river
and
upon
which
a
great
part
of
stockholm
is
built
that
place
was
also
fortified
numerous
catapults
defended
the
channels
between
the
islands
then
they
entered
the
lake
a
large
sheet
of
water
about
seventy
miles
long
dotted
with
fourteen
hundred
islands
whose
banks
were
covered
with
superb
forests
of
oak
of
gigantic
size
and
after
a
pleasant
journey
reached
upsalir
hjorvard
was
received
with
much
honor
by
yngvi
his
kinsman
the
ruler
of
svithjod
who
descended
from

in

and
there
was
great
feasting
during
his
stay
many
of
the
dwellings
and
buildings
of
upsalir
dated
from
the
time
of

was
believed
to
have
been
built
by

it
was
of
the

magnificence
and

and
the

around

until
they
partook

of
the
temple
was
and
a
masterpiece
of
carving
representing

to

in
its
sacrifices
which
were
the

invoked
and
then
the
holy

that
had
been
dipped
in
the
sacrificed
blood
were
thrown
into
the

the
answer
came
that
sigrlin
would
bear
a

in

a
year
then
with
great
joy
he
sailed
for

to
announce
to

what
the

had
foretold
after

remained
at

which
had
been
predicted
by
the
casting
of
the
sacrificing
chips
he
spent
his
time
surveying

watched
over
very
carefully
the

often
superintended
the

was
a
good
husbandman
and
to
amuse
himself
he
made
several
fine
damascened

he
paid
special

forecast
about
fourteen
months
after
the
return
of
hjorvard
from
upsalir
towards
the
year
a
great
event
took
place
at
dampstadir
which
filled
the
hearts
of
hjorvard
and
sigrlin
with
joy
the
sacrifice
which
hjorvard
had
made
to
the
gods
in
upsalir
to
stop
the
sterility
of
his
wife
had
been
accepted
and
sigrlin
gave
birth
to
a
son
while
this
happened
hjorvard
was
in
the
great
banqueting
hall
entertaining
some
of
his
kinsmen
who
had
come
to
see
him
and
was
then
listening
to
a
poet
who
was
singing
the
heroic
deeds
of
the
ancestors
of
the
race
messengers
were
sent
to
him
to
apprise
him
of
his
good
fortune
present
at
the
birth
of
the
child
were
oddrun
the
married
sister
of
hjorvard
and
several
other
women
and
others
who
lived
at
or
near
dampstadir
and
also
the
female
servants
for
it
was
the
law
of
the
land
that
women
had
to
be
witnesses
of
the
birth
of
a
child
and
none
of
those
who
were
present
could
leave
the
place
until
they
had
seen
the
babe
on
the
breast
of
his
mother
according
to
custom
the
infant
was
laid
on
the
floor
to
wait
for
the
arrival
of
his
father
after
hjorvard
had
entered
the
room
the
child
was
put
into
his
lap
and
he
covered
him
with
the
folds
of
one
of
the
corners
of
his
cloak
doing
this
he
acknowledged
the
legitimacy
of
his
offspring
then
he
looked
at
his
child
intently
to
judge
of
his
appearance
proportions
luck
and
temper
after
a
thoughtful
examination
and
satisfying
himself
that
the
offspring
was
he
decided
that
he
should
live
and
not
be
exposed
this
custom
was
similar
to
that
of
the
father
was
the
only
judge
to
decide
if
the
babe
was
to
live
or
not
then
took
place
the
most
important
and
sacred
ceremony
of
name
fastening
equivalent
to
baptism
or
pouring
or
sprinkling
water
upon
the
child
a
holy
custom
which
had
come
down
from
the
remotest
time
and
was
lost
in
the
mist
of
ages
a
vessel
filled
with
water
was
brought
in
and
hjorvard
poured
water
upon
the
child
and
said
in
a
loud
voice
so
that
the
people
should
hear
him
ivar
shall
the
boy
be
named
after
his
grandfather
he
will
of
odin
s
family
the
foremost
man
be
called
he
will
fight
many
battles
and
be
much
like
his
mother
and
be
called
his
father
s
son
for
he
will
wage
war
from
early
age
and
wander
far
and
after
this
ceremony
the
life
of
ivar
like
that
of
all
other
men
was
sacred
his
father
had
not
the
power
to
expose
him
or
to
take
his
life
and
if
he
did
it
would
be
murder
hjorvard
gave
first
as
a
name
fastening
a
sprig
of
garlic
as
a
symbol
that
as
the
garlic
stood
high
among
the
grass
so
would
little
ivar
stand
among
men
then
he
placed
by
his
side
a
sword
and
a
sax
a
coat
of
mail
a
shield
and
a
helmet
of
silver
these
had
been
made
specially
beforehand
in
case
the
expected
infant
should
be
a
boy
and
hence
came
the
common
saying
that
infants
were
born
with
weapons
he
also
gave
him
two
large
landed
estates

called
ringstadir

other

thereof
according

ancient
custom
the
champions
and
warriors
of
hjorvard
said
that
good
years
were
in
store
for
them
as
little
ivar
would
become
in
time
a
mighty
warrior
who
like
his
father
and

would
lead
them
to
victory
as
he
had
the
piercing
eyes
of
the
ynglingars
during
the
night

followed
the
ceremony
of

reigned
in

that

ivar
throve
well
to
the
delight
of
his
father
and
mother
and
there
was
great
joy
in
the
family
when
he
cut
his
first
tooth
his
father
according
to
ancient
custom
gave
him
on
that
occasion
a
gift
called

the
gift
was
a
knife
in
a
gold
sheath
attached
to
a
leather
belt
sewn
and
embroidered
with
gold
thread
the
buckle
was
a
beautiful
work
of
solid
gold
he
gave
him
also
with
this
a
large
farm
not

from

which
was
to
become
his
residence
when
he
became
a

grew
to

beautiful
child
he
was
fair
and
had
blue
eyes
resembling
the
people
of
his
kin
like
all
boys
of
his
age
he
loved
to
play
and
nothing
delighted
him
more
than
to
put
in
the
water
a
toy
boat
with
a
sail
and
watch
its
going
to
sea
when
he
had
attained
his
sixth
year
his
parents
began
to
think
about
sending
him
to
be
fostered
as
it
was
the
custom
of
the
land
for
boys
of
prominent
and
leading
men
not
to
be
reared
at
home
for
fear
they
should
become
effeminate
they
were
sent
to
some
distinguished

known
for
his

child
could
have

in

should
require
hjorvard

had
many
anxious
thoughts
in

to
the
education
of
little
ivar
for
they
wanted
him
to
become
wise
and
the
most
accomplished
of
warriors
their
love
for
him
was
unbounded
and
it
required
great
strength
of
character
for
both
to
be
willing
to
part
from
him
for
several
years
but
they
felt
that
their
greatest
duty
was
the
welfare
of
their

their
thoughts
had
centred
upon
a
noble
man
as
the
of
ivar
of
the
name
of
gudbrand
a
hersir
who
no
longer
undertook
to
lead
expeditions
into
countries
he
ruled
over
the
island
of
engel
which
is
still
called
so
to
this
day
and
which
is
situated
in
the
cattegat
not
far
from
the
beautiful
promontory
of
kullen
and
close
to
the
present
southern
swedish
shore
for
him
both
husband
and
wife
had
the
greatest
friendship
esteem
and
admiration
no
better
man
could
be
found
to
educate
a
boy
in
all
the
accomplishments
which
were
necessary
for
the
to
possess
in
those
days
gudbrand
and
hjorvard
were
and
had
gone
on
many
warlike
expeditions
together
many
a
roman
gallic
and
british
head
had
fallen
under
their
saxes
and
swords
they
had
shared
and
escaped
many
dangers
and
had
received
dangerous
wounds
together
and
the
love
one
bore
towards
the
other
was
very
great
gudbrand
was
not
as
powerful
a
hersir
as
hjorvard
and
did
not
possess
as
many
estates
and
as
much
gold
but
he
was
closely
related
to
many
of
the
chiefs
who
ruled
over
the
large
peninsula
comprising
the
present
sweden
and
norway
he
was
also
of
odin
s
kin
hjorvard
and
sigrlin
having
made
up
their
minds
that
gudbrand
should
foster
ivar
concluded
to
send
messengers
to
him
to
invite
him
to
come
and
make
them
a
visit
but
without
telling
the
reason
why
they
had
told
no
one
of
their
intentions
in
regard
to
the
man
whom
they
wanted
to
foster
ivar
the
vessels
were
made
ready
to
carry
the
messengers
when
an
unforeseen
event
prevented
their
departure
on
the
morning
of
the
day
appointed
for
their
sailing
a
fleet
of
fifteen
sail
was
signalled
from
one
of
the
towers
as
being
seen
very
far
off
on
the
horizon
they
were
so
far
away
that
they
could
not
be
observed
from
the
shore
finally
they
were
sighted
by
those
on
the
beach
and
gradually
they
became
more
and
more
distinct
as
they
approached
the
land
and
there
was
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
they
were
steering
for
dampstadir
the
white
peace
shields
were
clearly
discerned
at
the
mastheads
also
the
color
of
each
ship
was
clearly
seen
the
sight
was
beautiful
as
the
vessels
came
nearer
and
nearer
the
land
the
shields
of
the
warriors
lay
side
by
side
covering
each
other
partly
outside
along
the
gunwales
and
their
variegated
colors
especially
yellow
red
and
black
presented
a
picturesque
sight
the
striped
colored
sails
added
no
little
to
the
beauty
of
the
sight
ahead
of
all
was
a
at
its
masthead
a
standard
embroidered
with
gold
with
an
eagle
in
the
centre
by
which
the
people
recognized
at
once
the
of
gudbrand
hjorvard
and
sigrlin
who
were
watching
from
the
highest
tower
were
greatly
rejoiced
at
the
sight
they
considered
the
arrival
at
such
an
opportune
moment
of
gudbrand
whom
they
wanted
to
see
so
much
as
a
good
omen
for
the
future
of
their
son
hjorvard
walked
towards
the
shore
to
meet
his
and
took
a
rowboat
to
go
on
board
and
welcome
him
as
soon
as
his
ship
had
cast
anchor
gudbrand
was
received
with
hearty
demonstrations
of
joy
and
with
great
honor
by
hjorvard
who
had
not
seen
his
for
more
than
two
years
he
was
led
to
the
great
hall
and
seated
on
the
high
seat
opposite
to
that
of
hjorvard
and
all
the
commanders
or
styrmen
as
they
were
called
of
gudbrand
s
ships
and
his
champions
were
there
also
and
seated
according
to
their
rank
there
was
deep
drinking
that
day
a
great
feast
took
place
the
ale
and
the
mead
were
passed
freely
and
served
in
silver
and
golden
horns
and
there
was
much
merriment
until
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
after
which
all
retired
to
their
separate
houses
gudbrand
was
given
the
finest
house
intended
for
guests
for
his
residence
while
in
dampstadir
the
following
day
as
gudbrand
was
quietly
talking
with
the
champions
of
hjorvard
in
the
banqueting
hall
and
was
intensely
interested
in
listening
to
one
of
them
who
was
describing
a
great
wrestling
contest
that
had
taken
place
a
few
days
before
hjorvard
entered
unnoticed
with
ivar
in
his
arms
and
as
gudbrand
saluted
him
he
put
little
ivar
on
his
knees
before
he
was
aware
of
it
it
was
an
ancient
custom
that
the
man
upon
whose
knee
a
child
had
been
thus
as
this
ceremony
was
called
was
bound
to
become
his
fosterer
until
he
became
of
age
a
shout
of
assent
arose
from
hjorvard
s
champions
as
an
approval
of
the
choice
of
their
chief
for
whom
every
one
was
ready
to
sacrifice
his
life
no
wonder
they
approved
the
choice
for
gudbrand
was
well
known
for
his
wisdom
skill
in
athletic
games
and
many
other
accomplishments
hjorvard
could
have
shown
no
greater
proof
of
friendship
esteem
and
regard
to
gudbrand
than
by
what
he
had
just
done
gudbrand
promised
his
and
that
he
would
bring
up
little
ivar
to
the
best
of
his
abilities
and
then
added
with
a
thoughtful
voice
hjorvard
thou
knowest
well
the
ancient
saying
an
early
sown
field
shall
no
man
trust
nor
his
son
too
soon
for
the
weather
rules
the
fields
and
wits
guide
the
son
each
of
these
is
thou
knowest
well
also
he
continued
that
the
nornir
rule
unevenly
the
fates
of
men
to
a
few
they
predestine
a
happy
and
contented
life
to
many
a
short
or
a
long
one
to
some
but
little
property
or
praise
many
they
have
fated
to
sorrows
or
to
be
unlucky
to
one
man
they
give
great
wealth
and
a
miser
s
heart
to
a
poor
man
a
most
generous
disposition
it
seems
to
me
that
he
who
has
the
miser
s
heart
ought
to
have
been
poor
and
the
one
that
has
a
giving
heart
to
have
been
rich
but
such
are
the
decrees
of
the
nornir
and
no
one
can
understand
or
escape
them
fame
and
poverty
are
often
given
to
the
poet
but
his
name
will
endure
forever
his
mound
will
always
be
green
in
the
memory
of
man
like
the
deeds
of
great
there
was
great
feasting
in
dampstadir
during
the
remainder
of
gudbrand
s
stay
many
a
warrior
drank
more
than
he
ought
to
have
done
as
was
the
custom
in
those
times
but
hospitality
was
most
unbounded
and
chiefs
did
not
want
to
have
the
reputation
of
being
miserly
many
evenings
were
spent
in
listening
to
the
songs
of
poets
who
recited
the
great
deeds
of
war
of
hjorvard
s
and
gudbrand
s
ancestors
and
also
those
that
had
been
accomplished
by
the
two
hersirs
gudbrand
had
among
the
champions
who
had
come
with
him
a
man
of
the
name
of
ulf
who
was
a
great
poet
or
scald
and
only
spoke
in
verse
and
answered
also
in
that
manner
his
fame
was
very
great
but
in
despite
of
offers
of
great
pay
by
powerful
chiefs
he
remained
with
gudbrand
for
he
loved
him
dearly
and
to
him
the
land
of
engel
was
the
most
beautiful
spot
he
had
ever
seen
one
evening
after
gudbrand
and
all
the
champions
had
retired
hjorvard
remained
all
alone
with
ulf
who
composed
on
the
spot
a
magnificent
song
on
the
deeds
of
hjorvard
s
father
and
it
took
a
great
part
of
the
night
to
recite
it
hjorvard
thanked
him
and
the
next
day
spoke
to
his
intendant
who
had
charge
of
all
his
treasures
and
after
telling
him
of
ulf
s
wonderful
gift
asked
him
how
he
should
reward
the
scald
shall
i
give
him
two
trading
ships
said
he
that
is
too
much
i
think
was
the
treasurer
s
reply
other
chiefs
give
costly
swords
or
good
gold
rewards
for
a
song
made
for
them
hjorvard
answered
but
the
ruler
of
gotland
is
above
and
much
richer
than
many
so
he
concluded
to
present
ulf
with
a
fine
trading
ship
a
new
scarlet
cloak
a
sword
and
a
heavy
bracelet
of
gold
and
invited
him
to
come
and
stay
a
whole
year
with
him
ulf
thanked
hjorvard
and
said
that
he
would
come
in
two
years
on
his
return
from
a
visit
to
his
kinsmen
in
britain
after
a
sojourn
of
over
three
weeks
gudbrand
talked
of
returning
to
engel
sigrlin
tried
with
all
her
power
of
persuasion
to
make
him
stay
longer
and
pleaded
that
ivar
s
outfit
was
not
ready
though
she
had
been
busy
with
her
maids
sewing
and
making
garments
for
him
and
succeeded
in
inducing
him
to
remain
another
week
she
was
loth
to
see
the
day
of
gudbrand
s
departure
the
thought
of
parting
with
her
darling
little
son
broke
her
heart
at
last
the
last
day
came
when
ivar
was
to
leave
his
mother
and
father
and
go
and
learn
how
to
become
an
accomplished
man
and
warrior
sigrlin
did
not
sleep
that
last
night
ivar
slept
unconscious
in
her
arms
the
whole
of
the
night
she
fondled
him
and
half
fancying
she
was
bidding
him
farewell
then
often
pressed
him
so
tightly
against
her
heart
that
two
or
three
times
during
the
night
she
awoke
him
no
wonder
that
her
mother
s
heart
grieved
for
it
was
not
a
separation
of
a
day
from
her
child
he
was
not
to
be
away
from
her
for
a
month
but
for
long
years
when
she
got
up
in
the
morning
the
rosy
hues
of
her
cheek
had
disappeared
she
dreaded
to
look
at
the
sun
and
to
see
it
rising
higher
and
higher
for
that
betokened
that
noon
the
hour
of
departure
was
getting
nearer
and
nearer
but
sigrlin
was
proud
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
her
unusual
pallor
no
one
would
have
guessed
the
sorrow
and
anxiety
which
she
was
secretly
suffering
when
the
morning
meal
was
over
the
bustle
which
took
place
told
that
preparations
were
being
made
for
the
departure
of
gudbrand
men
were
going
to
their
ships
and
bidding
to
their
old
or
new
friends
many
parting
bumpers
were
drunk
hjorvard
had
given
a
great
number
of
costly
presents
of
gold
to
gudbrand
and
to
many
of
his
warriors
finally
all
the
men
had
gone
on
board
of
their
respective
ships
and
only
the
vessel
of
gudbrand
remained
near
the
shore
at
last
the
sight
of
the
sun
to
the
great
sorrow
of
sigrlin
showed
that
it
was
noon
the
time
had
arrived
for
her
to
show
her
courage
and
hide
her
emotion
and
she
must
appear
cheerful
despite
her
anguish
the
horns
for
departure
were
sounded
for
everything
was
ready
on
board
the
ships
the
sails
were
unfurled
and
the
anchors
were
raised
father
mother
and
all
the
household
and
many
people
including
the
poor
slaves
who
in
despite
of
their
servitude
loved
their
master
and
mistress
accompanied
gudbrand
and
ivar
to
the
shore
the
little
fellow
walked
between
his
parents
chatted
merrily
as
he
went
along
each
one
holding
one
of
his
hands
and
looking
down
fondly
upon
him
finally
they
reached
the
gangway
and
after
wishing
each
other
often
they
parted
with
expressions
of
great
love
and
friendship
sigrlin
remained
on
the
headland
near
dampstadir
until
the
ships
had
disappeared
below
the
horizon
and
then
with
a
deep
sigh
she
retraced
her
steps
homewards
and
while
alone
in
her
bower
the
of
her
mother
s
heart
gave
way
and
she
wept
long
the
wind
was
fair
and
after
an
eventless
sail
of
three
days
gudbrand
s
fleet
reached
hrafnista
the
burg
and
residence
of
gudbrand
on
engel
sigrid
gudbrand
s
wife
was
enthusiastically
delighted
when
she
saw
her
husband
with
little
ivar
to
foster
and
no
wonder
for
he
was
such
a
dear
little
fellow
and
so
handsome
besides
sigrid
prepared
a
nice
room
close
to
hers
for
him
for
her
first
thought
was
to
try
to
make
him
as
comfortable
as
when
he
was
at
home
she
and
her
husband
intended
to
bring
him
up
with
the
greatest
care
and
affection
for
they
felt
the
great
responsibility
that
had
been
thrown
upon
them
for
a
few
days
ivar
was
homesick
he
missed
his
mother
and
father
very
much
and
also
his
playmates
everything
was
new
to
him
in
hrafnista
but
gradually
he
became
reconciled
to
his
new
home
and
began
to
love
more
and
more
his
gudbrand
and
sigrid
had
a
son
named
hjalmar
who
was
a
year
older
than
ivar
father
and
mother
determined
that
hjalmar
should
be
educated
at
home
also
so
that
the
two
boys
might
become
as
was
the
custom
of
the
time
for
children
that
were
brought
up
together
a
close
friendship
sprang
up
between
the
two
lads
and
as
they
grew
up
they
became
inseparable
and
in
any
dispute
that
one
had
with
other
boys
the
other
was
sure
to
take
the
part
of
his
at
times
other
children
of
their
age
were
invited
to
join
them
in
their
play
and
occasionally
contests
of
strength
and
skill
took
place
among
these
young
lads
for
the
championship
in
each
of
their
games
during
which
they
were
applauded
and
cheered
by
those
of
their
elders
who
were
present
the
education
of
the
two
boys
began
in
earnest
as
they
grew
older
and
both
made
steady
progress
they
were
taught
gymnastic
exercises
games
of
ball
wrestling
running
jumping
swimming
they
also
learned
how
to
row
to
steer
and
to
furl
or
to
reef
a
sail
and
became
excellent
riders
on
horseback
as
well
as
sailors
they
were
even
taught
the
practical
side
of
shipbuilding
and
were
often
to
be
seen
working
very
hard
in
the
shipyards
the
greatest
attention
was
paid
to
their
physical
training
which
was
considered
of
the
highest
importance
for
skill
and
agility
were
absolutely
necessary
to
a
warrior
without
them
he
could
not
obtain
victory
over
his
foe
or
escape
danger
besides
which
these
exercises
made
them
strong
and
healthy
as
time
went
along
the
love
between
ivar
and
his
increased
greatly
as
he
became
older
he
grew
in
strength
and
manliness
each
following
year
showing
great
improvement
of
mind
and
body
both
lads
had
been
taught
how
to
write
runic
characters
and
also
had
learned
the
meaning
of
mystic
knowledge
that
was
only
acquired
by
the
sons
of
that
when
necessary
they
might
send
messages
that
could
only
be
deciphered
by
those
for
whom
they
were
intended
they
could
write
beautifully
on
birch
bark
which
was
made
almost
as
thin
as
papyrus
for
that
purpose
or
they
could
engrave
runic
letters
upon
wood
stone
and
jewels
of
gold
and
silver
and
inlay
mystic
letters
in
the
blades
of
weapons
the
art
of
writing
was
so
ancient
in
the
north
that
the
people
believed
that
it
had
been
taught
to
them
by
odin
but
at
the
period
we
are
speaking
of
the
romans
greeks
and
norsemen
were
the
only
people
who
knew
how
to
read
and
write
in
europe
ivar
and
hjalmar
as
they
grew
older
became
great
athletes
and
excelled
in
skill
and
dexterity
all
the
lads
of
their
age
they
could
swim
like
seals
people
said
clad
with
their
armor
and
carried
then
their
weapons
on
their
backs
they
could
throw
a
spear
as
well
with
the
left
as
with
the
right
hand
they
could
handle
a
sword
an
axe
or
a
shield
in
the
same
manner
and
in
a
word
could
shoot
and
strike
with
both
hands
equally
well
they
could
handle
the
sword
or
sax
with
such
rapidity
of
movement
that
the
blade
could
not
be
seen
in
the
air
and
only
its
hissing
be
heard
they
could
shoot
with
the
bow
with
an
unerring
eye
and
hit
a
checker
on
the
head
of
a
man
without
wounding
his
scalp
they
could
throw
a
stone
with
a
sling
with
fatal
accuracy
and
woe
to
the
man
for
whom
the
stone
was
intended
ivar
could
leap
almost
equally
well
forward
or
backward
and
had
even
greater
dexterity
than
his
and
no
young
man
of
his
age
could
compete
with
him
in
any
of
the
athletic
games
both
were
constantly
trained
in
naval
exercises
especially
when
a
great
number
of
vessels
had
come
together
they
were
also
taught
foreign
languages
for
it
was
absolutely
necessary
for
vikings
to
understand
the
language
of
the
countries
with
which
they
traded
or
upon
which
they
made
war
for
as
we
have
said
their
commercial
or
warlike
expeditions
extended
far
and
wide
they
could
write
impromptu
poetry
but
poetry
being
a
gift
of
the
gods
only
its
rules
and
metres
were
taught
to
them
for
to
be
a
scald
one
had
to
be
born
a
scald
they
had
also
learned
how
to
play
chess
which
was
a
game
much
in
vogue
among
the
norsemen
gudbrand
filled
the
minds
of
the
lads
with
the
love
of
fame
by
recounting
to
them
the
great
expeditions
he
had
undertaken
conjointly
with
hjorvard
or
sang
to
them
the
valorous
deeds
recorded
by
the
scalds
of
the
old
warriors
who
had
gone
to
valhalla
so
that
when
the
time
came
they
both
might
emulate
their
examples
as
ivar
grew
older
he
became
deeply
inquisitive
concerning
divers
subjects
in
regard
to
which
he
began
to
take
great
interest
one
early
morning
he
saw
gudbrand
seated
as
was
often
his
wont
upon
the
mound
of
his
father
contemplating
the
sea
and
going
up
to
him
on
a
sudden
impulse
he
said
tell
me
how
things
were
in
the
beginning
and
about
the
gudbrand
answered
thou
knowest
well
that
our
worship
is
the
true
one
we
belong
to
odin
and
are
loved
by
him
and
by
the
gods
before
the
creation
the
universe
was
a
gaping
void
called
ginnungagap
and
nothing
existed
on
each
side
of
this
gaping
void
there
were
two
the
world
of
cold
and
muspelheim
the
world
of
heat
in
the
south
the
part
of
the
gaping
void
turning
towards
the
north
was
filled
with
weight
of
ice
and
rime
and
the
opposite
side
with
drizzle
and
gusts
of
wind
the
southern
part
of
ginnungagap
became
less
heavy
from
the
sparks
and
glowing
substances
which
came
flying
from
muspelheim
and
just
as
the
cold
and
all
things
come
from
niflheim
the
things
near
muspelheim
were
hot
and
shining
ginnungagap
was
as
warm
as
windless
air
so
that
when
the
rime
and
the
breath
of
the
heat
met
the
rime
melted
into
drops
from
elivagar
the
stream
flowing
from
the
well
hvergelmir
in
niflheim
spurted
drops
of
poison
which
froze
and
grew
into
a
jotun
who
was
called
ymir
but
the
hrimthursar
call
him
orgelmir
and
the
kin
of
the
hrimthursar
have
sprung
from
him
when
ymir
lived
in
early
ages
there
were
neither
sands
nor
sea
nor
cool
waves
no
earth
no
grass
and
no
heavens
above
there
was
only
ginnungagap
numberless
years
before
the
earth
was
shaped
was
bergelmir
born
trudgelmir
was
his
father
and
orgelmir
his
on
what
did
ymir
live
or
by
what
asked
ivar
gudbrand
replied
it
happened
that
when
the
hoar
frost
fell
in
drops
the
cow
audhumla
grew
out
of
it
four
rivers
of
milk
ran
from
her
teats
and
she
fed
ymir
audhumla
for
food
licked
the
rime
stones
covered
with
salt
and
rime
and
the
first
day
she
licked
them
a
man
s
hair
came
out
of
them
the
second
day
a
man
s
head
the
third
day
a
whole
man
was
there
he
was
called
buri
and
was
handsome
in
looks
large
and
mighty
he
had
bor
for
son
who
got
besla
daughter
of
the
jotun
or
hrimthurs
bolthorn
for
a
wife
and
she
had
three
sons
odin
vili
and
ve
from
them
the
asar
or
the
kin
of
odin
are
descended
it
is
said
that
the
sons
of
bor
odin
vili
and
ve
slew
ymir
and
that
so
much
blood
flowed
from
his
wounds
that
he
drowned
the
whole
race
of
the
hrimthursar
except
bergelmir
and
his
wife
who
escaped
in
a
flour
bin
and
from
them
is
descended
a
new
race
of
how
was
the
world
created
asked
ivar
from
ymir
s
flesh
the
earth
was
shaped
and
from
his
blood

the
mountains
from
his
bones
from
his

and
the

from
his

from
his

made
midgard
for
the

from
his

created

ivar

would
stop
at
hrafnista
when
he
passed
before
engel
with
his
fleet
bound
for
some
expedition
against
the
roman
provinces
or
on
his
return
from
them
then
there
was
great
joy
in
the
household
and
it
was
with
pride
that
he
saw
the
great
progress
his
son
was
making
in
all
manly
exercises
and
mental
training
his
mother
came
to
see
him
about
once
in
two
years
and
how
proud
she
was
of
her
son
need
not
be
told
chapter
vi
ivar
attains
his
majority
on
the
last
day
of
the
sixth
week
the
norse
week
having
but
five
days
of
the
month
corresponding
to
our
september
ivar
reached
his
fifteenth
year
and
by
law
became
of
age
the
morning
of
that
day
gudbrand
presented
him
with
a
beautiful
ship
called
the
elidi
it
had
on
board
weapons
for
a
crew
of
two
hundred
and
forty
men
the
golden
standard
which
was
hoisted
at
the
masthead
had
been
embroidered
by
his
and
was
called
the
victorious
that
victory
might
be
sure
to
follow
it
wherever
it
floated
many
spells
and
incantations
had
been
repeated
over
it
when
it
was
made
the
length
of
the
elidi
was
one
hundred
and
eighty
feet
it
had
benches
for
rowers
the
poetical
name
given
to
the
craft
was
the
stallion
of
the
surf
hjalmar
also
received
a
beautiful
ship
as
a
present
which
also
had
weapons
on
board
for
a
crew
of
two
hundred
and
forty
men
this
vessel
was
called
the
trani
and
went
under
the
poetical
name
of
the
deer
of
the
surf
the
following
day
gudbrand
with
his
son
and
sailed
for
the
mainland
and
after
landing
they
pulled
their
boat
ashore
beyond
the
reach
of
the
waves
and
then
entered
a
great
forest
of
oaks
gudbrand
had
come
for
a
special
purpose
with
the
two
lads
after
building
a
camp
he
left
them
the
following
morning
and
started
out
with
his
dogs
he
did
not
return
in
the
evening
the
second
day
also
passed
and
still
he
did
not
return
on
the
third
day
towards
noon
ivar
and
hjalmar
heard
the
barking
of
the
dogs
and
soon
after
two
wolves
ran
quickly
by
them
and
a
short
time
afterwards
gudbrand
made
his
appearance
with
a
large
wolf
he
had
just
killed
with
two
arrows
he
had
gone
on
that
hunt
for
the
purpose
of
killing
a
wolf
for
he
believed
firmly
that
ivar
and
hjalmar
after
drinking
of
its
blood
and
eating
of
its
heart
would
become
braver
than
they
were
before
and
would
partake
of
the
fierceness
of
the
wolf
while
in
battle
and
that
also
they
would
be
able
to
understand
the
language
of
birds
after
gudbrand
had
rested
he
opened
the
wolf
s
carcass
and
made
the
two
lads
drink
a
mouthful
of
its
blood
then
he
took
out
its
heart
and
going
to
the
fire
roasted
it
on
a
spit
and
when
the
blood
dripped
from
it
he
thought
it
was
cooked
enough
and
dividing
it
in
two
he
gave
each
a
part
after
they
had
done
eating
and
drinking
of
the
wolf
s
heart
and
blood
gudbrand
said
now
i
expect
you
never
to
flee
from
danger
or
weapons
be
brave
like
your
kinsmen
of
after
this
they
returned
to
engel
gudbrand
and
sigrid
loved
ivar
quite
as
much
as
their
own
son
and
resolved
to
make
both
equal
heirs
in
their
property
but
this
act
could
only
be
done
publicly
and
by
performing
a
ceremony
which
was
called
taking
another
into
one
s
inheritance
and
it
had
to
be
done
with
the
approval
and
consent
of
the
direct
heir
or
heirs
and
according
to
forms
of
law
which
were
very
ancient
and
precise
on
the
subject
a
day
was
named
by
gudbrand
for
taking
ivar
into
his
family
so
that
witnesses
might
be
present
and
also
those
who
would
otherwise
be
themselves
entitled
to
his
inheritance
ale
from
three
measures
of
grain
had
been
brewed
and
a
bull
three
winters
old
had
been
killed
and
the
skin
was
flayed
from
its
right
hind
leg
above
the
hoof
and
from
that
skin
a
shoe
was
made
then
in
presence
of
hjalmar
his
son
who
was
his
direct
heir
gudbrand
asked
ivar
his
to
step
into
the
shoe
after
ivar
had
done
this
he
asked
his
own
son
to
do
likewise
which
hjalmar
did
with
great
willingness
after
this
ceremony
which
was
of
great
antiquity
ivar
was
led
into
the
embrace
of
his
and
mother
then
gudbrand
said
in
presence
of
witnesses
i
lead
this
man
ivar
hjorvardson
to
my
property
and
make
him
conjoint
heir
with
my
son
hjalmar
and
this
i
do
with
the
consent
of
my
kinsmen
who
are
heirs
to
my
after
which
he
reminded
ivar
that
he
must
announce
publicly
every
twentieth
year
that
he
was
conjoint
heir
with
hjalmar
gudbrandson
until
he
should
get
his
inheritance
ivar
replied
that
he
hoped
that
his
who
had
raised
him
so
tenderly
and
lovingly
with
his
would
live
long
to
enjoy
his
property
and
thanked
him
for
his
great
kindness
and
the
fatherly
care
he
had
bestowed
upon
him
a
short
time
after
ivar
had
been
made
with
hjalmar
the
two
resolved
to
equip
the
elidi
and
the
trani
with
a
peace
crew
of
one
hundred
and
twenty
men
for
each
vessel
no
one
coming
to
serve
on
board
could
be
less
than
eighteen
years
old
or
more
than
fifty
they
were
to
have
the
same
laws
that
hjorvard
had
it
was
the
first
time
that
both
were
to
command
or
to
use
the
phraseology
of
the
norsemen
in
which
the
commanders
were
called
styrmen
to
steer
their
own
ships
it
was
quite
an
event
in
their
lives
to
which
they
had
been
looking
forward
with
great
delight
all
the
chiefs
of
the
viking
lands
had
been
at
peace
with
each
other
for
a
long
time
but
incessant
expeditions
took
place
one
after
another
against
the
roman
empire
and
the
ships
returned
home
with
many
spoils
and
slaves
it
was
the
intention
of
the
to
go
first
to
dampstadir
for
ivar
wanted
very
much
to
see
his
mother
and
father
and
to
show
them
how
much
he
had
grown
and
improved
both
were
yet
too
young
to
look
like
thorough
warriors
for
their
moustaches
had
not
made
their
appearance
and
it
was
the
custom
of
warriors
to
wear
them
after
a
visit
to
dampstadir
they
intended
to
visit
some
of
their
kinsmen
who
ruled
over
different
realms
before
leaving
hrafnista
gudbrand
said
to
them
have
you
taken
costly
presents
with
you
and
when
the
two
youths
replied
no
he
continued
you
must
take
some
for
i
never
yet
met
a
man
so
or
free
with
his
food
that
he
would
not
take
a
gift
nor
one
so
lavish
with
his
property
that
rewards
were
to
him
then
he
added
with
weapons
and
clothes
such
as
are
most
sightly
to
one
s
self
shall
friends
gladden
each
other
givers
and
receivers
are
the
longest
friends
if
they
give
with
good
hearts
and
good
after
saying
this
he
went
to
one
of
his
and
brought
to
them
several
swords
and
saxes
inlaid
with
gold
several
costly
foreign
cloaks
beautiful
brooches
of
gold
some
superb
or
bracelets
and
lovely
necklaces
all
also
of
gold
these
objects
said
he
to
them
you
must
give
to
the
men
and
women
you
shall
visit
the
necklaces
will
be
for
their
wives
and
the
day
before
sailing
gudbrand
called
ivar
and
hjalmar
and
bade
them
to
sit
by
him
and
saying
i
have
called
you
to
give
you
some
advice
which
i
think
may
prove
useful
to
you
and
which
i
hope
you
will
heed
he
spoke
as
follows
when
you
come
to
a
meal
among
strangers
be
silent
or
talk
little
listen
and
look
on
speak
usefully
or
not
at
all
no
man
will
then
blame
you
for
never
mock
at
a
guest
or
wayfarer
remember
that
no
man
is
so
good
that
a
fault
follows
him
not
nor
so
bad
that
he
is
good
for
nothing
never
laugh
at
a
hoary
wise
man
for
often
it
is
good
and
wise
what
old
men
say
skilled
words
come
often
out
of
a
shrivelled
remember
that
love
is
the
door
that
is
open
to
all
that
are
in
need
give
and
be
generous
if
not
every
kind
of
evil
will
be
wished
to
that
same
evening
gudbrand
sent
for
his
son
hjalmar
and
said
to
him
what
gladdens
me
is
that
no
man
will
have
thy
head
at
his
feet
although
thou
wilt
have
narrow
escapes
here
is
a
sword
kinsman
hjalmar
which
i
wish
to
give
thee
its
name
is
dragvandil
and
victory
has
always
followed
it
my
father
took
it
from
the
slain
björn
i
have
another
remarkable
weapon
a
mighty
spear
which
i
took
from
harek
but
i
know
it
is
not
manageable
by
any
one
who
has
not
reached
his
full
the
day
before
their
ships
were
ready
to
sail
the
made
a
great
sacrifice
to
frey
who
ruled
over
wealth
and
the
seasons
when
ready
to
start
both
sigrid
and
gudbrand
followed
them
to
their
ships
and
bade
them
an
affectionate
farewell
after
a
pleasant
passage
they
reached
dampstadir
where
they
were
received
with
great
joy
by
hjorvard
and
sigrlin
the
mother
looked
with
the
utmost
pride
upon
her
son
who
was
the
embodiment
of
manliness
and
hjalmar
was
treated
in
as
kindly
manner
as
his
for
they
loved
him
dearly
also
every
thing
was
very
quiet
in
gotland
the
harvest
was
taking
place
and
people
were
busy
in
the
fields
the
champions
of
hjorvard
were
absent
and
had
gone
with
a
large
number
of
ships
to
make
war
in
gaul
and
britain
and
were
expected
to
return
soon
the
two
youths
spent
a
great
deal
of
their
time
in
the
practice
of
athletic
games
and
every
morning
they
were
seen
in
the
fields
where
these
took
place
ivar
visited
his
kinsmen
and
the
friends
living
on
the
island
and
also
occupied
himself
in
learning
still
more
of
the
art
of
shipbuilding
for
he
wished
the
norsemen
to
say
that
his
ships
were
the
finest
in
the
land
he
liked
good
horses
and
bred
them
two
of
his
stallions
called
slonjvir
the
flying
one
and
hviting
were
known
among
all
the
lovers
of
horses
and
he
drove
a
beautiful
carriage
adorned
with
handsome
ornaments
the
harness
of
the
horses

ornamented
with
gold

in
these
exercises
and

ivar
s

while
in
dampstadir
ivar
attained
his
eighteenth
year
and
had
reached
that
age
when
all
young
men
went
upon
warlike
expeditions
when
the
opportunity
was
offered
them
and
great
warriors
and
powerful
chiefs
would
have
no
one
younger
than
this
age
on
board
of
their
ships
some
days
after
his
eighteenth
birthday
hjorvard
who
was
seated
on
the
mound
of
his
father
sent
for
ivar
and
after
he
had
arrived
he
said
to
him
from
thy
grandfather

mound
upon
which
we
are
and
whose
deeds
of
valor
are
known
all
over
the

are
recited
by
the
poets
and
will
continue
to
be
until
the
end
of
time
thou
seest
surrounding
us
the
graves
of
many
of
thy
kinsmen
who
have
also
gone
to
valhalla
each
of
them
died
valiantly
among
them
i
want
to
teach
thee
the
same
precepts
of
wisdom
which
my
father
counselled
me
to
follow
when
i
was
about
thy
age
i
have
found
them
useful
during
my
life
and
they
will
also
be
of
good
service
to
thee
if
thou
heedest
after
a
pause
he
continued
kinsman
listen
to
me
it
has
been
the
custom
from
immemorial
time
that
sons
of
chiefs
should
go
to
war
and
acquire
wealth
and
honor
and
that
personal
property
should
not
be
inherited
nor
son
get
it
after
his
father
but
that
it
should
be
placed
on
the
pyre
and
in
the
mound
with
themselves
though
their
sons
get
the
land
and
estates
they
can
not
hold
their
rank
and
dignity
unless
they
place
themselves
and
their
men
in
danger
and
go
to
war
earning
thus
property
and
honors
one
after
another
and
thus
following
in
the
footsteps
of
their
kinsmen
seek
fame
and
renown
in
good
deeds
for
these
never
die
and
will
be
remembered
by
the
sons
of
men
until
the
end
of
time
many
a
man
since
odin
created
the
world
has
spent
his
life
in
getting
wealth
and
to
obtain
it
has
become
miserly
their
hearts
only
delight
in
the
sight
of
gold
but
not
one
of
these
is
remembered
by
mankind
their
names
and
their
wealth
have
passed
away
but
the
names
of
great
scalds
and
of
the
men
who
have
accomplished
great
deeds
will
live
forever
though
the
nornir
have
shaped
their
lives
so
that
they
be
poor
and
die
in
poverty
so
my
son
be
lavish
with
thy
wealth
and
with
the
tributes
that
will
be
paid
to
thee
by
those
thou
hast
conquered
be
rich
in
good
deeds
liberal
and
valiant
men
live
best
but
the
unwise
fear
everything
a
more
faithful
friend
will
a
man
never
get
than
sound
good
sense
after
a
man
has
been
wounded
and
lies
helpless
under
thy
blow
on
the
ground
i
need
not
tell
thee
for
thy
manhood
tells
it
to
thee
not
to
inflict
another
wound
on
him
for
then
it
is
murder
if
thou
diest
in
the
fight
it
is
because
odin
has
chosen
thee
to
go
to
him
if
thou
art
victorious
it
is
because
he
has
given
thee
victory
both
alternatives
are
good
gladsheim
is
the
home
of
the
glad
there
the
gleaming
valhalla
or
the
hall
of
the
slain
stands
and
odin
chooses
every
day
men
slain
by
weapons
that
hall
is
easily
recognized
by
those
who
come
there
for
it
is
roofed
with
shafts
and
thatched
with
shields
the
benches
are
covered
with
it
has
five
hundred
and
forty
doors
and
eight
hundred
einherjar
for
so
are
called
the
chosen
pass
through
it
at
once
a
wolf
hangs
over
the
main
entrance
of
valhalla
try
to
be
more
welcome
there
than
any
chief
that
has
reddened
the
sax
and
carried
far
and
wide
the
bloody
blade
enter
valhalla
bespattered
with
blood
odin
gives
victory
to
his
sons
wealth
to
some
eloquence
and
wisdom
to
a
few
songs
to
poets
luck
in
love
to
many
chosen
weapons
to
those
he
loves
and
fair
winds
to
mariners
it
is
time
for
thee
to
go
to
war
and
thus
become
worthy
of
thy
ancestors
and
be
their
equal
in
fame
if
thou
obtainest
renown
be
not
vain
and
boastful
for
fame
is
given
to
thee
by
the
people
and
why
shouldst
thou
be
proud
towards
the
giver
a
quiet
demeanor
never
hurts
a
man
while
people
laugh
at
those
who
are
puffed
up
in
their
own
pride
many
a
man
is
made
a
fool
by
success
the
and
famous
should
never
be
after
saying
this
hjorvard
presented
ivar
with
the
sword
angrvadil
it
was
a
superb
damascened
weapon
with
a
hilt
ornamented
with
gold
its
scabbard
was
almost
covered
with
gold
it
was
celebrated
all
over
the
north
on
account
of
its
quality
and
was
called
by
the
poets
odin
s
flame
the
gleam
of
battle
the
injurer
of
shields
the
leader
of
when
ivar
had
inspected
and
admired
it
his
father
continued
angrvadil
has
been
with
our
kin
for
generations
and
it
is
as
good
as
in
the
days
of
yore
thy
grandfather
and
myself
have
gone
into
sixty
battles
with
it
and
it
has
gained
the
victory
each
time
and
it
has
never
been
dulled
never
let
angrvadil
go
out
of
our
family
for
misfortune
will
overtake
our
kin
if
it
does
not
remain
in
the
possession
of
our
kinsmen
it
will
help
thee
also
in
duels
courage
is
in
its
blade
terror
in
its
point
and
luck
in
its
hilt
this
sword
is
infallible
added
hjorvard
pointing
to
the
mystic
letters
of
gold
inlaid
on
the
blade
near
the
hilt
it
is
death
to
the
one
who
is
wounded
by
it
hrotti
my
own
sword
thou
wilt
use
after
my
ivar
thanked
his
father
and
said
that
his
gift
pleased
him
better
than
if
it
had
been
gold
in
abundance
or
large
estates
and
added
he
did
not
know
what
the
nornir
had
fated
him
but
that
he
hoped
to
die
in
the
midst
of
victory
he
thanked
his
father
too
for
the
good
counsel
he
had
always
given
him
and
above
all
for
the
great
love
he
had
shown
towards
him
and
with
great
warmth
of
feeling
added
that
he
would
try
to
emulate
him
in
all
his
actions
and
hoped
that
none
of
his
kinsmen
in
valhalla
would
ever
be
ashamed
of
him
after
leaving
his
father
he
went
to
his
mother
and
said
to
her
i
want
thee
mother
to
show
me
the
cloaks
which
heid
the
sybil
made
for
my
father
a
long
time
sigrlin
opened
a
large
chest
and
answered
here
they
are
and
they
are
almost
as
good
as
ivar
took
them
up
they
were
with
sleeves
and
a
hood
at
the
top
with
a
covering
for
the
face
they
were
wide
and
long
it
was
believed
that
no
iron
could
cut
them
and
that
weapons
could
not
damage
them
for
they
had
been
made
with
cunning
witchcraft
and
incantations
ivar
took
the
two
which
were
the
largest
then
he
went
to
hringstadir
to
see
the
halls
and
estate
which
his
father
had
given
him
the
day
that
he
had
fastened
the
name
of
ivar
upon
him
ivar
remembered
all
that
his
father
had
said
to
him
and
was
anxious
to
obtain
renown
and
wealth
and
so
he
and
his
went
one
morning
to
hjorvard
and
said
now
tell
us
father
of
the
viking
whom
thou
knowest
to
be
the
bravest
and
hjorvard
replied
you
are
young
men
yet
you
seem
to
think
that
no
man
can
withstand
you
but
i
will
tell
you
of
two
vikings
of
whom
i
know
they
are
called
sigurd
and
sigmund
they
are
skilled
in
many
things
and
very
great
how
many
ships
have
they
asked
ivar
they
have
thirty
ships
replied
hjorvard
and
one
hundred
and
twenty
men
on
each
where
have
they
land
inquired
hjalmar
in
the
southern
part
of
svithjod
replied
hjorvard
they
are
on
land
in
winter
and
lie
on
board
their
warships
in
we
will
go
and
try
to
find
where
they
are
and
fight
them
cried
both
at
the
same
time
and
we
will
see
who
are
the
foremost
vikings
and
champions
in
the
the
day
after
this
conversation
the
champions
of
hjorvard
returned
with
a
great
deal
of
booty
they
had
won
in
the
countries
subject
to
rome
and
hjorvard
asked
some
of
them
to
join
his
son
and
hjalmar
for
said
he
they
are
still
inexperienced
in
the
art
of
the
at
once
set
to
work
to
make
their
fleet
ready
which
did
not
take
long
for
the
vessels
had
been
subjected
to
a
thorough
overhauling
during
the
winter
the
elidi
had
been
fitted
up
very
splendidly
and
ivar
placed
on
board
his
and
berserks
the
prow
defenders
were
most
carefully
selected
for
they
were
to
defend
his
standard
the
whole
of
the
crew
were
berserks
who
surpassed
others
in
strength
and
bravery
picked
men
were
also
stationed
at
the
stern
and
the
number
on
board
was
two
hundred
and
forty
ivar
s
hjalmar
had
also
a
picked
crew
among
them
skilful
archers
and
sling
men
who
had
not
their
equal
in
the
land
the
standard
of
ivar
which
his
had
made
for
him
floated
on
board
of
the
elidi
and
hjalmar
s
on
board
the
trani
two
days
before
the
sailing
of
the
fleet
of
the
ivar
came
to
his
father
and
said
to
him
tell
me
father
some
of
the
omens
that
thou
thinkest
might
be
useful
to
men
who
go
to
wage
hjorvard
answered
many
warnings
are
useful
if
men
know
them
and
heed
them
the
following
of
the
black
raven
is
good
for
a
warrior
for
it
means
victory
no
man
should
fight
against
the
late
shining
sun
sister
of
the
moon
there
is
danger
for
thee
if
thou
stumblest
or
fallest
from
thy
horse
when
thou
rushest
into
fight
for
faithless
family
spirits
stand
on
either
side
of
thee
if
thou
walkest
out
and
art
prepared
for
a
journey
and
meet
on
the
path
men
ready
to
praise
thee
and
hear
wolves
under
ash
trees
good
luck
wilt
thou
get
if
thou
seest
the
wolves
ahead
of
thee
those
are
a
few
of
the
omens
that
should
be
a
warning
to
thee
i
want
also
to
give
thee
some
other
advice
he
continued
wisdom
and
weapons
are
not
easy
to
get
for
the
chief
that
would
be
the
foremost
among
men
the
sons
of
men
need
often
eyes
of
foresight
in
the
fight
early
should
he
rise
who
wishes
to
acquire
wealth
seldom
does
a
sleepy
wolf
get
a
thigh
bone
or
a
sleepy
man
victory
courage
is
better
than
the
power
of
swords
where
the
angry
must
fight
i
have
seen
bold
men
win
victory
with
a
blunt
sword
it
is
better
for
the
bold
than
for
the
coward
to
be
in
the
game
of
the
valkyrias
silent
and
thoughtful
and
bold
in
battle
should
a
hersir
s
son
be
the
unwise
man
thinks
he
will
live
forever
if
he
shuns
fight
but
old
age
gives
him
no
peace
though
spears
may
spare
after
this
they
separated
when
the
were
ready
to
sail
hjorvard
walked
down
with
them
to
their
ships
and
bade
them
farewell
lovingly
they
sailed
away
from
dampstadir
with
a
fair
wind
and
with
their
sails
set
but
after
a
while
it
became
calm
and
the
vessels
had
to
be
propelled
by
oars
as
they
were
losing
sight
of
land
a
crow
flew
over
the
ships
with
loud
caws
ivar
looked
at
it
hjalmar
said
to
his
does
it
mean
anything
to
thee
it
does
answered
ivar
another
crow
flew
over
the
ship
cawing
also
hjalmar
forgot
to
row
and
his
oar
got
loose
in
his
hand
ivar
said
thou
art
very
attentive
to
the
crow
what
does
it
say
i
do
not
know
for
i
have
some
difficulty
in
understanding
another
crow
passed
over
the
boat
cawing
louder
than
the
two
others
and
flying
nearer
the
ships
then
ivar
observed
this
signifies
much
to
us
i
understand
that
we
will
be
victorious
in
our
expeditions
against
the
vikings
for
as
my
father
said
to
me
the
following
of
the
raven
is
a
good
finally
they
sighted
the
coast
of
svithjod
and
came
to
a
long
and
somewhat
high
promontory
and
they
cast
anchor
there
afterwards
they
put
tents
upon
their
ships
for
the
night
the
lamps
were
lighted
and
the
men
to
pass
away
the
time
before
they
went
to
sleep
played
chess
the
used
on
board
of
vessels
had
a
hole
in
each
square
and
each
piece
a
peg
to
make
it
fast
so
that
the
rolling
of
the
ship
could
not
upset
the
game
when
tired
they
put
themselves
into
their
leather
bags
and
went
to
sleep
the
following
morning
ivar
went
ashore
to
see
if
he
could
discover
aught
or
hear
any
news
but
he
saw
no
houses
or
people
after
walking
a
while
across
the
promontory
he
observed
thirty
ships
lying
at
anchor
and
war
tents
near
the
beach
the
crew
was
ashore
and
engaged
in
practising
athletic
games
some
were
wrestling
others
were
running
and
jumping
and
many
were
performing
warlike
exercises
with
swords
and
spears
and
shooting
at
targets
with
arrows
sigmund
and
sigurd
steered
these
ships
that
is
were
their
commanders
and
these
two
men
were
the
very
vikings
whom
hjorvard
had
mentioned
to
ivar
and
his
ivar
immediately
returned
to
his
ships
and
told
the
great
news
to
hjalmar
and
his
men
what
shall
we
do
next
thereupon
asked
hjalmar
we
will
divide
our
men
and
our
ships
ivar
answered
into
two
equal
squadrons
thou
hjalmar
shalt
with
half
the
ships
pass
the
cape
and
raise
a
battle
cry
against
those
who
are
on
shore
and
hoist
the
red
shield
i
will
land
from
this
side
with
of
my
crew
go
along
the
forest
and
with
them
raise
another
battle
cry
then
perhaps
they
may
be
startled
by
our
appearance
and
conclude
to
retire
into
the
forest
and
nothing
further
hjalmar
rounded
the
cape
with
his
ships
and
ivar
landed
with
his
men
and
the
plan
suggested
by
ivar
was
carried
out
sigmund
and
sigurd
and
their
men
however
were
not
in
the
least
startled
when
they
heard
the
battle
cry
of
hjalmar
at
sea
and
another
battle
cry
on
land
they
stopped
their
games
while
the
shout
lasted
and
then
continued
as
before
hjalmar
then
went
ashore
to
meet
ivar
and
after
they
met
ivar
said
i
know
not
for
certain
whether
these
men
are
afraid
or
not
for
they
do
not
seem
to
mind
our
war
what
will
you
have
us
do
inquired
hjalmar
that
is
soon
told
replied
ivar
we
will
not
steal
upon
them
we
will
stay
this
night
at
the
cape
and
remain
there
until
when
morning
came
the
landed
with
all
their
men
and
marched
towards
sigurd
and
sigmund
who
had
all
their
men
armed
and
in
readiness
for
a
conflict
when
sigurd
and
sigmund
saw
hjalmar
and
ivar
coming
towards
them
they
went
to
meet
them
sigurd
was
and
a
very
great
viking
he
had
travelled
far
and
wide
and
seen
countries
that
were
unknown
to
most
people
he
was
short
of
stature
and
had
attained
the
meridian
of
life
gray
hair
was
beginning
to
show
itself
he
was
the
oldest
of
the
four
chiefs
sigmund
was
also
younger
than
sigurd
but
older
than
ivar
and
hjalmar
sigurd
asked
when
they
met
who
was
their
leader
ivar
answered
there
is
more
than
one
chief
what
is
thy
name
asked
sigmund
my
name
is
ivar
son
of
hjorvard
of
dampstadir
and
my
is
hjalmar
son
of
gudbrand
of
what
is
your
errand
here
said
sigurd
ivar
answered
i
wish
to
know
which
of
us
is
the
more
how
many
ships
have
you
asked
sigurd
we
have
twenty
ships
said
ivar
and
how
many
have
you
we
have
thirty
ships
answered
sigurd
that
is
great
odds
against
us
said
ivar
ten
ships
crews
shall
not
take
part
in
the
battle
replied
sigurd
and
man
shall
fight
against
this
is
fair
answered
ivar
and
it
is
the
law
of
valiant
both
sides
arrayed
their
men
and
made
themselves
ready
for
the
conflict
which
was
speedily
begun
and
continued
all
day
towards
night
the
peace
shield
was
raised
and
sigurd
asked
ivar
what
thinkest
thou
of
this
day
s
conflict
ivar
answered
i
am
well
wilt
thou
play
the
game
again
asked
sigurd
that
is
my
intention
replied
ivar
for
i
never
found
better
and
hardier
champions
we
will
begin
the
battle
again
at
full
the
men
then
went
to
their
war
booths
and
dressed
their
wounds
the
next
morning
both
sides
arrayed
their
men
for
the
battle
and
fought
all
day
when
it
began
to
grow
dark
the
peace
shield
was
again
raised
sigurd
asked
ivar
how
the
fighting
pleased
him
on
that
day
very
well
was
the
answer
wilt
thou
then
said
sigurd
try
this
game
the
third
day
ivar
then
replied
then
we
will
finish
the
hearing
this
sigurd
who
was
a
man
of
great
common
sense
said
to
ivar
may
we
expect
much
booty
on
your
ships
if
we
gain
the
victory
far
from
it
ivar
replied
we
have
taken
none
this
i
think
said
sigurd
i
have
nowhere
met
more
foolish
men
than
here
for
we
only
fight
out
of
pride
and
what
wilt
thou
do
then
inquired
ivar
let
us
become
replied
sigurd
for
we
are
of
equal
well
said
answered
ivar
and
hjalmar
for
we
think
it
right
that
we
should
bind
our
friendship
and
swear
one
another
it
will
be
a
great
boon
for
us
all
as
we
four
will
become
the
greatest
warriors
and
vikings
of
the
the
following
morning
preparations
were
made
to
carry
out
the
proposal
of
the
preceding
afternoon
that
ivar
and
hjalmar
should
become
with
sigmund
and
sigurd
it
was
a
common
custom
which
had
come
down
from
the
remotest
times
formally
and
solemnly
to
form
ties
of
friendship
between
men
by
swearing
one
another
this
relation
was
of
a
most
sacred
and
binding
character
those
who
made
the
compact
pledged
themselves
to
be
unselfish
and
true
to
each
other
for
life
and
to
share
the
same
dangers
these
four
vikings
first
cut
three
long
slices
of
turf
in
a
shape
the
ends
of
which
were
fastened
into
the
ground
and
the
loops
raised
so
high
that
those
who
were
to
swear
could
go
under
them
under
these
loops
they
placed
a
spear
inlaid
with
mystic
signs
of
such
a
height
that
a
man
could
reach
with
his
hand
the
nail
fastening
the
socket
of
the
to
the
handle
the
warriors
on
both
sides
had
assembled
to
witness
the
ceremony
it
was
a
beautiful
summer
day
the
sun
shone
brilliantly
nature
was
smiling
birds
were
singing
in
the
groves
butterflies
and
bees
were
flitting
from
wild
flower
to
wild
flower
no
one
could
ever
dream
of
the
fierce
conflict
of
the
preceding
days
in
the
midst
of
profound
silence
sigurd
advanced
towards
ivar
and
the
three
other
vikings
and
said
to
them
you
are
aware
that
from
immemorial
time
it
has
been
the
custom
of
valiant
men
who
make
this
agreement
of
between
themselves
that
the
one
that
lives
the
longest
should
avenge
the
others
if
they
are
slain
with
weapons
or
yes
answered
ivar
hjalmar
and
sigmund
then
they
prepared
themselves
for
the
oath
of
which
was
sacredly
binding
although
not
taken
on
the
temple
ring
as
oaths
generally
were
sigurd
hjalmar
sigmund
and
ivar
then
passed
under
the
loop
and
drew
blood
from
the
hollow
of
their
hands
and
let
it
run
together
into
the
mould
which
had
been
cut
under
the
loop
of
the
turf
and
mixed
together
the
earth
and
the
blood
thereupon
they
all
fell
on
their
knees
and
took
oaths
to
ratify
their
agreement
and
called
upon
odin
frey
njord
and
the
other
gods
as
witnesses
and
then
they
all
clasped
hands
according
to
ancient
custom
as
a
seal
to
their
oaths
the
four
agreed
that
they
would
never
rob
traders
and
bondi
or
other
men
except
when
they
must
make
a
raid
on
land
for
their
men
in
case
of
need
in
which
case
they
were
to
pay
full
value
for
what
they
took
never
were
they
to
rob
women
though
they
should
find
them
temptingly
rich
nor
should
women
be
brought
on
board
their
ships
against
their
will
and
should
a
woman
show
that
this
had
been
done
against
her
will
the
man
of
the
crew
found
guilty
of
such
a
crime
against
this
law
should
lose
his
life
for
it
whether
he
were
powerful
or
not
it
was
also
agreed
that
they
should
possess
in
common
the
booty
they
might
get
on
viking
expeditions
and
that
whichever
lived
the
longest
should
have
a
mound
raised
over
the
others
after
the
battle
or
otherwise
and
place
therein
as
much
property
as
seemed
to
him
most
befitting
their
rank
and
be
it
told
now
that
to
their
death
they
loved
each
other
dearly
and
never
violated
in
the
slightest
manner
the
duties
that
were
imposed
upon
them
by
their
compact
of
the
first
thing
the
four
concluded
to
do
in
concert
after
consultation
was
to
visit
gudmund
sigurd
s
father
who
was
a
powerful
hersir
and
ruled
over
the
large
island
called
oland
near
the
coast
of
the
present
sweden
and
to
apprise
him
of
their
new
relationship
they
set
sail
and
after
a
short
and
pleasant
voyage
their
ships
cast
anchor
in
a
bay
where
the
quiet
little
town
of
borgholm
stands
at
that
time
gudmund
s
burg
stood
there
and
near
by
are
still
seen
many
graves
and
mounds
of
that
period
the
were
received
with
great
kindness
and
there
was
great
drinking
and
feasting
ivar
was
seated
in
the
second
high
seat
during
their
visit
after
a
stay
of
a
week
they
made
their
ships
ready
intending
to
sail
southward
and
visit
gudbrand
to
apprise
him
also
of
their
new
relationship
when
the
time
came
for
them
to
depart
gudmund
followed
them
to
the
ships
and
as
they
were
ready
to
embark
presented
sigurd
with
three
arrows
which
had
a
famous
name
and
were
called
gusi
s
followers
the
feathers
were
gilded
and
they
were
ornamented
with
gold
these
arrows
said
gudmund
ketil
hœng
thy
took
from
gusi
who
ruled
over
the
fins
they
hit
and
bite
everything
they
are
aimed
at
and
were
forged
in
the
days
of
old
by
sigurd
thanked
his
father
saying
no
gifts
have
i
which
i
prize
more
highly
after
which
they
sailed
away
soon
they
came
to
a
beautiful
bay
on
the
shore
of
which
were
seen
very
many
very
ancient
cairns
near
where
the
little
sleepy
town
of
cimbrisham
is
to
be
seen
these
graves
were
filled
with
beautiful
bronze
weapons
and
many
gold
objects
they
landed
and
found
the
place
in
great
commotion
for
a
trial
by
ordeal
was
to
take
place
a
named
hjerka
had
told
vemund
the
hersir
who
ruled
there
that
she
had
seen
gunvor
his
wife
and
a
man
of
the
herad
walk
together
vemund
was
no
longer
merry
after
he
heard
this
for
he
loved
his
wife
dearly
but
he
wished
to
be
sure
that
what
the
had
said
was
true
before
he
took
steps
to
avenge
himself
but
he
had
not
thus
far
succeeded
and
no
one
was
ever
seen
with
his
wife
nevertheless
his
jealousy
preyed
upon
him
and
one
day
as
he
was
speaking
to
her
his
sadness
was
so
marked
in
his
countenance
that
she
asked
the
reason
why
then
he
told
her
that
he
thought
she
loved
another
upon
hearing
this
she
was
struck
speechless
with
indignation
her
eyes
flashed
fire
her
pure
heart
revolted
against
such
an
accusation
or
insinuation
her
face
turned
pale
and
flushed
alternately
then
a
sudden
look
of
despair
of
intense
pain
and
sorrow
followed
her
looks
of
anger
was
it
possible
that
her
husband
could
believe
such
a
tale
then
she
said
to
him
i
will
take
oaths
before
thee
and
many
men
upon
the
white
holy
stone
that
i
have
not
acted
with
anyone
as
thou
seemest
to
believe
send
for
halfdan
the
ruler
of
zeeland
that
he
may
consecrate
the
boiling
the
were
just
in
time
to
witness
the
trial
halfdan
was
sent
for
and
in
the
presence
of
hundreds
of
witnesses
who
had
come
to
see
the
ordeal
he
consecrated
with
the
sign
of
the
hammer
of
thor
the
caldron
before
the
water
was
boiling
and
the
holy
white
stone
used
for
such
an
ordeal
then
gunvor
said
with
a
loud
voice
heard
through
the
hall
by
those
present
i
can
not
call
on
my
brothers
to
avenge
such
an
accusation
with
the
sword
for
they
are
all
dead
look
now
men
i
am
truthful
see
how
the
water
boils
let
herkja
go
to
the
cauldron
she
who
attributes
treachery
to
herkja
put
her
hand
into
the
cauldron
to
take
the
sacred
stone
and
no
one
could
witness
a
more
pitiful
sight
than
those
who
beheld
how
the
hands
of
herkja
were
scalded
when
the
people
saw
this
they
said
that
herkja
was
guilty
of
false
accusation
and
perjury
and
they
led
the
maid
into
a
foul
mire
where
she
met
her
death
the
following
day
knut
an
uncle
of
sigurd
who
had
become
very
old
felt
that
his
last
days
were
approaching
and
as
there
was
universal
peace
he
could
not
fall
on
the
and
so
go
valiantly
to
valhalla
as
all
warriors
did
who
died
fighting
the
foe
he
determined
nevertheless
that
he
would
not
die
in
his
bed
for
he
did
not
wish
to
go
to
hel
it
was
the
belief
of
the
norsemen
that
those
who
had
not
fallen
by
weapons
went
to
hel
hel
was
one
of
nine
worlds
that
composed
the
universe
but
in
that
hel
there
was
no
punishment
so
he
called
his
family
together
and
divided
among
them
his
gold
and
silver
and
other
valuable
things
and
then
told
them
that
he
was
going
to
throw
himself
from
a
high
cliff
for
all
who
did
this
were
believed
to
go
to
valhalla
his
family
followed
him
cheerfully
and
as
he
was
on
the
brink
of
the
precipice
whence
not
infrequently
men
threw
themselves
down
they
bade
him
a
happy
journey
to
valhalla
and
he
took
forthwith
the
fatal
plunge
a
large
mound
was
raised
over
him
and
all
the
people
extolled
his
courageous
deed
after
witnessing
the
ordeal
and
the
death
of
knut
the
four
continued
their
voyage
skirting
the
shores
of
the
peninsula
passing
several
beautiful
burgs
and
estates
several
days
afterwards
they
cast
anchor
at
the
mouth
of
a
river
almost
opposite
the
island
of
engel
for
they
did
not
stop
at
hrafnista
as
gudbrand
and
sigrlin
had
gone
on
a
visit
north
to
friends
who
lived
on
the
shores
of
the
present
christiania
fjord
there
ruled
a
valiant
hersir
named
gautrek
the
old
who
in
his
day
had
been
a
foremost
viking
but
on
account
of
his
age
had
given
up
warfare
he
had
nine
sons
by
alvig
the
wise
daughter
of
eyvind
of
holmgard
they
were
called
thengil
ræsir
gram
gylfi
hilmir
jofur
tyggi
skuli
harri
these
nine
brothers
became
so
famous
in
warfare
that
in
all
songs
their
names
are
used
as
names
of
rank
all
fell
in
battle
having
never
married
a
great
feast
was
prepared
for
ivar
his
and
his
men
gautrek
had
a
beautiful
daughter
of
the
name
of
svanhild
and
after
the
guests
had
been
seated
she
entered
the
hall
with
several
maidens
and
advanced
to
the
high
seat
which
ivar
occupied
opposite
to
that
of
her
father
she
handed
to
him
a
drinking
horn
of
gold
filled
up
with
mead
and
said
hail
to
thee
ivar
son
of
hjorvard
hail
to
you
all
ye
warriors
that
have
come
with
him
then
she
seated
herself
by
her
father
there
was
great
feasting
and
drinking
during
the
time
they
remained
with
gautrek
and
after
a
stay
of
three
days
which
was
the
accustomed
time
for
a
visit
of
that
kind
ivar
left
the
place
with
his
fleet
and
continued
to
sail
northward
a
short
summer
gale
sprang
up
during
the
time
it
lasted
the
elidi
was
ahead
of
all
the
other
ships
for
she
was
very
swift
and
but
few
vessels
were
her
equal
in
speed
in
the
whole
northern
land
the
fleet
got
shelter
behind
the
numerous
islands
that
line
the
coast
and
made
ready
to
enter
the
stream
which
is
now
known
as
the
hams
river
upon
which
the
town
of
hamstad
is
situated
in
the
province
called
by
the
name
of
halland
the
peace
shields
were
hoisted
at
the
mastheads
and
shields
were
placed
all
along
the
gunwales
and
the
dragons
of
red
gold
shone
resplendently
in
the
light
of
the
sun
arnfid
hersir
ruled
over
the
country
when
the
ships
cast
anchor
he
was
seated
on
the
mound
of
his
father
which
overlooked
the
river
and
the
sea
it
was
his
custom
to
sit
there
and
hunt
with
his
hawks
these
brought
him
from
time
to
time
a
hare
black
cock
or
a
partridge
he
recognized
the
elidi
by
its
pennant
and
knew
that
its
commander
was
ivar
the
son
of
hjorvard
the
wide
spreading
one
of
his
companions
in
arms
and
the
ships
often
disappeared
from
his
sight
on
account
of
the
bends
in
the
river
which
were
covered
with
forests
but
finally
they
cast
anchor
below
the
burg
or
residence
of
arnfid
arnfid
sent
messengers
to
invite
ivar
and
his
and
their
men
to
come
ashore
as
the
gotlanders
had
never
ravaged
his
realm
the
invitation
was
accepted
ivar
thereupon
addressed
his
friends
and
followers
in
this
wise
let
us
beware
of
drinking
too
much
a
man
carries
on
the
road
no
better
burden
than
sound
wit
and
common
sense
wisdom
is
needed
by
him
who
travels
widely
no
provisions
on
a
journey
weigh
a
man
to
the
ground
more
than
too
much
ale
the
ale
of
the
sons
of
men
is
not
so
good
as
men
say
it
is
for
the
more
a
man
drinks
the
less
wit
he
has
the
spirit
that
hovers
over
is
called
the
heron
of
oblivion
it
steals
away
men
s
senses
the
ale
is
best
when
every
man
gets
his
reason
back
strife
and
ale
have
caused
grief
of
mind
to
many
men
death
to
some
curses
to
others
many
are
the

of

thou
shalt
not
quarrel
with

men
many

nevertheless
a
man
may
not
send
away
the
cup
but
drink
ivar
and
his
men
dressed
themselves
in
their
best
and
went
ashore
when
they
were
immediately
led
to
the
banqueting
hall
where
a
great
feast
was
prepared
in
the
honor
of
ivar
and
of
his
and
their
following
arnfid
was
seated
in
his
high
seat
and
welcomed
his
guests
he
bade
ivar
to
sit
in
the
high
seat
opposite
his
arnfid
had
a
daughter
celebrated
for
her
beauty
and
accomplishments
her
name
was
ingegerd
and
before
the
feast
had
begun
she
came
to
the
hall
with
several
handsome
maidens
who
were
visiting
her
they
were
beautifully
attired
ingegerd
herself
wore
a
red
dress
of
thick
woollen
material
lavishly
embroidered
with
gold
the
material
had
been
brought
to
her
by
her
father
on
his
return
from
a
voyage
to
the
caspian
the
train
several
feet
in
length
swept
gracefully
on
the
floor
her
hair
was
braided
and
fell
over
her
shoulders
gracefully
as
was
the
custom
with
young
maidens
a
beautiful
gold
band
encircled
her
forehead
round
her
snowy
neck
hung
a
necklace
of
delicate
gold
beads
her
tall
and
slender
form
was
made
to
appear
still
more
graceful
by
a
belt
of
gold
of
exquisite
workmanship
that
encircled
her
waist
her
arms
were
adorned
by
two
delicate
spiral
gold
bracelets
and
on
one
of
the
fingers
of
her
right
hand
was
a
spiral
ring
ending
in
snakes
heads
that
had
belonged
to
her
mother
before
the
meal
was
served
arnfid
announced
that
seats
were
about
to
be
allotted
that
men
and
women
might
drink
together
as
many
as
could
and
that
men
without
companions
should
drink
by
themselves
so
they
placed
lots
in
a
cloth
each
with
the
name
of
a
guest
written
upon
it
arnfid
was
to
pick
them
out
the
lot
fell
that
ivar
should
drink
with
ingegerd
and
sit
next
to
her
that
evening
when
ready
to
sit
down
ingegerd
sang
haughtily
to
ivar
what
wilt
thou
do
lad
in
my
seat
for
seldom
if
ever
hast
thou
given
a
wolf
warm
flesh
nor
hast
thou
seen
the
raven
croak
over
the
neither
hast
thou
been
where
swords
meet
and
where
valkyrias
soar
over
the
these
words
meant
that
ivar
had
never
been
in
battle
so
that
neither
wolf
nor
raven
nor
valkyrias
had
followed
him
and
if
this
was
so
he
was
not
worthy
to
sit
by
her
side
ivar
looked
at
her
beautiful
and
proud
face
and
sang
i
have
handled
the
bloody
blade
the
ravens
have
followed
my
track
i
have
made
warfare
and
been
the
champion
in
many
games
of
strength
and
skill
be
not
so
proud
maiden
like
thyself
i
am
of
odin
s
kin
the
son
of
hjorvard
follows
in
the
footsteps
of
his
when
ingegerd
heard
these
words
she
smiled
looking
at
him
and
seated
herself
by
his
side
and
they
drank
together
and
were
merry
many
a
maiden
was
seated
by
the
side
of
brave
and
mighty
champions
that
who
had
seen
many
lands
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
which
these
norse
women
appreciated
more
than
personal
bravery
and
none
but
the
very
bravest
could
aspire
to
the
hand
of
those
of
high
lineage
wine
ale
beer
and
mead
were
served
in
drinking
cups
of
glass
from
greece
or
in
silver
cups
of
great
beauty
with
work
of
gold
representing
panther
chasing
deer
and
horses
running
away
these
also
had
come
from
the
black
sea
where
the
greeks
had
colonies
the
food
was
served
in
silver
dishes
containing
roast
pork
veal
birds
and
fish
two
sorts
of
bread
were
on
the
kind
soft
and
made
of
rye
the
other
flat
almost
as
thin
as
wafers
the
same
kind
as
is
served
in
norway
when
the
men
had
begun
to
be
somewhat
too
merry
for
the
presence
of
women
ingegerd
and
the
maidens
who
had
come
with
her
to
the
feast
rose
and
left
the
hall
bidding
all
but
that
night
ingegerd
herself
could
not
sleep
her
thoughts
were
always
reverting
to
ivar
and
without
knowing
it
she
loved
him
or
perhaps
her
feeling
was
infatuation
rather
than
love
therefore
the
next
day
she
prepared
the
drink
of
oblivion
for
ivar
to
cause
him
to
forget
the
girl
he
case
he
did
love
sent
her
to
invite
him
to
her
bower
she
had
prepared
the
draught
with
many
incantations
and
according
to
a
mystic
formula
it
was
of
sea
water
sacrificed
blood
a
long
ling
fish
an
unripened
wheat
ear
sacrificed
intestine
of
beast
herbs
of
every
forest
burned
acorns
the
soot
of
the
hearth
a
boiled
swine
liver
to
which
were
added
all
kinds
of
mystic
runic
letters
painted
red
after
ivar
had
come
she
bade
him
drink
which
he
did
but
whether
it
was
an
efficacious
potion
or
not
could
not
be
proven
as
he
had
no
sweetheart
to
forget
on
the
third
day
the
made
ready
to
leave
arnfid
wanted
them
to
stay
longer
but
ivar
said
to
him
one
should
take
leave
in
good
time
the
guest
should
not
remain
too
long
the
loved
one
often
becomes
loathed
by
staying
over
many
so
they
parted
in
great
friendship
arnfid
gave
ivar
a
handsome
sword
with
hilt
and
scabbard
ornamented
with
gold
also
an
axe
inlaid
with
gold
of
very
fine
workmanship
and
costly
presents
to
his
and
men
ivar
gave
also
costly
presents
to
arnfid
and
his
men
ingegerd
from
her
bower
with
a
heavy
heart
watched
the
ships
sailing
away
and
wondered
if
she
would
ever
see
ivar
again
but
as
is
often
the
case
among
the
sons
and
daughters
of
men
ivar
and
ingegerd
were
never
to
meet
again
the
nornir
had
parted
them
that
day
for
life
and
were
to
prevent
them
from
continuing
the
courtship
that
was
written
in
runic
letters
of
gold
upon
the
heart
of
ingegerd
the
memory
of
the
hours
passed
between
ivar
and
her
was
all
that
was
to
be
left
it
was
but
a
dream
but
how
lovely
and
short
was
that
dream
love
had
germed
and
grown
up
in
three
days
but
it
was
doomed
to
perish
though
that
episode
of
their
lives
was
never
to
be
forgotten
yet
ingegerd
married
and
many
a
time
during
her
life
her
thoughts
wandered
back
to
the
days
we
have
just
spoken
of
she
thought
it
was
wrong
to
think
of
them
but
we
have
no
command
over
our
thoughts
they
will
come
unawares
in
spite
of
our
will
and
the
memory
of
the
past
will
cling
to
us
until
death
how
wise
it
is
that
no
one
can
read
our
thoughts
for
if
it
were
otherwise
how
many
happy
homes
might
be
made
unhappy
indeed
the
after
leaving
arnfid
stopped
at
engelholm
gudbrand
and
sigrid
having
returned
there
was
great
joy
in
hrafnista
on
their
arrival
hjalmar
was
to
remain
at
home
that
winter
ivar
sailed
to
dampstadir
with
sigurd
and
sigmund
for
he
wanted
his
father
to
know
his
two
new
they
were
to
spend
the
winter
with
him
and
all
were
to
meet
again
the
following
spring
hjorvard
and
sigrid
were
on
the
shore
to
meet
their
son
they
had
heard
of
his
two
new
for
ivar
had
written
them
about
the
fight
they
had
had
and
what
had
followed
and
gave
them
a
hearty
welcome
to
dampstadir

had
withstood
the
blasts
of
centuries
it
had
numerous
and
fantastic
gargoyles
a
long
piazza
round
it
and
the
interior
was
divided
into
two
parts

with
great
skill

middle
of
april
before
men
began
to

on
viking
expeditions
ivar
had
returned
to

the
sacrifice
to

taken
place
all
the
vikings
of
the
baltic
who
had
not
wintered
in
foreign
lands
had
come
back
for
a
frozen
sea
would
have
prevented
their
vessels
from
reaching
their
destination
if
they
had
been
late
although
the
shores
of
zeeland
and
fyen
and
the
coast
of
norway
were
free
from
ice
during
the
whole
year
with
rare
exceptions
yule
was
near
at
hand
and
the
midwinter
sacrifice
the
most
important
of
all
was
to
be
on
a
very
great
scale
at
dampstadir
more
animals
than

were
to
be
sacrificed

brought
with
them
their
provisions

this
festival
the
day
before

everyone
who
was
to

sacrifice
had
arrived

the
large
assembly
led
in
procession
as
was
customary
the
atonement
boar
which
had
been
consecrated
to
frey
the
animal
was
very
large
and
handsome
and
was
so
fine
that
it
seemed
as
if
every
bristle
on
it
was
of
gold
according
to
the
sacred
rites
the
boar
was
led
forward
and
those
who
were
to
make
vows
placed
one
hand
upon
the
head
of
the
sacred
animal
and
the
other
upon
its
bristles

many
other
chiefs
and
men

evening
the
sacrificing
ceremonies
began
the
animals
were
slaughtered
in
silence
and
their
blood
was
collected
in
the
sacrificing
bowl
that
had
been
taken
from
the
altar
and
after
being
filled
was
put
back
and
then
consecrated
by
hjorvard
making
the
sign
of
the
hammer
of
thor
over
it
after
which
the
altar
and
the
walls
of
the
temple
inside
and
outside
were
reddened
with
the
sacrificed
blood
and
then
the
people
were
also
sprinkled
with
the
blood
with
the
sacred
twigs
used
specially
for
the
purpose
of
sanctification
after
the
sprinkling
of
the
people
had
taken
place
the
flesh
of
the
slaughtered
animal
was
put
in
large
sacrificial
kettles
and
these
were
hung
over
the
holy
fires
which
ran
all
along
the
middle
of
the
temple
then
hjorvard
as
high
priest
consecrated
the
food
with
the
sign
of
the
hammer
of
thor
when
the
food
was
ready
the
horns
were
filled
with
ale
then
carried
round
the
fires
and
were
also
consecrated
after
these
ceremonies
the
people
who
had
been
standing
up
seated
themselves
along
the
walls
of
the
temple
and
then
ate
of
the
sacrificial
meat
of
oxen
and
horses
as
customary
the
horn
or
toast
to
odin
was
drunk
first
for
victory
and
also
for
the
continuation
of
the
power
of
hjorvard
then
the
horn
to
thor
for
those
who
trusted
in
their
own
strength
and
power
then
the
horns
to
njord
and
frey
for
good
years
and
peace
this
was
followed
by
the
toast
to
bragi
the
god
of
poetry
over
this
horn
according
to
custom
vows
were
made
and
these
vows
had
to
be
made
good
during
the
year
that
followed
this
was
the
most
important
toast
for
men
had
to
keep
their
word
or
die
in
the
attempt
to
accomplish
their
vows
many
also
drank
horns
to
those
of
their
dead
kinsmen
who
had
been
great
men
and
these
were
called
memorial
horns
after
this
hjorvard
arose
and
made
a
vow
that
he
would
drive
from
the
sea
every
roman
vessel
that
was
to
be
seen
along
the
coast
of
gaul
britain
frisia
or
die
in
the
undertaking
hromund
the
bold
rose
and
said
slight
is
thy
vow
indeed
hjorvard
for
it
requires
but
little
strength
and
will
to
drive
the
romans
from
the
sea
make
a
stronger
vow
which
will
show
thy
daring
and
bravery
then
i
will
follow
thee
and
make
my
hjorvard
answered
hromund
thou
art
right
i
vow
that
i
will
make
war
in
gaul
and
britain
and
come
back
with
great
booty
and
furthermore
i
will
sacrifice
the
prisoners
i
make
and
redden
with
their
blood
the
altar
of
the
gods
i
take
also
the
oath
that
if
any
vessels
of
the
romans
ever
try
to
come
to
our
land
as
they
never
have
tried
yet
not
one
of
their
men
shall
return
back
alive
to
tell
of
our
this
is
a
stronger
vow
than
the
first
said
hromund
the
hersir
but
there
is
little
fear
that
they
will
ever
come
to
our
land
for
they
dread
our
people
and
our
ships
their
warships
flee
at
the
approach
of
our
fleets
but
i
like
the
vows
thou
hast
made
to
attack
them
in
their
strongholds
of
gaul
and
then
he
himself
arose
and
said
i
vow
that
i
will
follow
thee
hjorvard
in
thy
expeditions
against
the
romans
with
all
my
ships
and
warriors
return
if
thou
returnest
or
die
a
warrior
s
death
if
thou
hast
been
fated
to
go
to
valhalla
in
thy
undertaking
for
as
we
have
sworn
to
avenge
each
then
hamund
the
valiant
arose
and
said
i
vow
that
i
will
follow
you
hjorvard
and
hromund
the
bold
with
all
my
ships
and
warriors
and
devastate
with
you
the
provinces
of
the
roman
empire
and
go
into
the
mediterranean
we
will
show
the
romans
that
they
can
not
withstand
the
power
of
the
norsemen
any
more
on
the
land
than
on
the
then
ingald
the
rose
and
said
i
take
the
oath
that
i
will
follow
you
all
and
that
my
standard
will
float
on
the
shores
of
britain
and
that
i
will
make
upon
that
island
a
settlement
that
the
power
of
the
roman
will
not
dare
to
attack
or
i
will
perish
in
the
ivar
rose
and
vowed
that
he
would
follow
his
father
in
that
expedition
or
die
in
the
undertaking
many
men
made
vows
that
night
after
these
vows
the
memorial
toasts
to
dead
kinsmen
took
place
the
scene
was
solemn
and
impressive
for
many
of
those
that
were
to
be
remembered
had
been
living
a
few
years
back
and
others
had
died
centuries
before
in
a
halo
of
glory
all
had
helped
to
make
the
land
of
the
vikings
what
it
was
the
most
feared
of
all
lands
after
the
departed
kinsmen
had
been
remembered
those
present
rose
and
vowed
to
follow
in
their
footsteps
those
who
could
not
come
to
the
temple
held
sacrifices
at
home
the
feast
among
the
people
lasted
thirteen
days
and
many
spent

farms
the
following
april
after
the
sacrifice
to

for
the
general
and
powerful
expeditions
that
were
soon
to
proceed
against
the
provinces
of
the
roman
empire
even
the
shores
of
the
mediterranean
were
also
to
be
attacked
many
of
the
vikings
intended
also
to
reënforce
by
their
numbers
the
colonies
that
had
been
made
by
their
kinsmen
in
britain
gaul
and
friesland
and
other

hjorvard
and
all
the
other
powerful
chiefs
who

taken
oaths
at
the
preceding
yule
sacrifice
at
dampstadir
had
not
forgotten
them
they
were
making
most
extensive
preparations
for
war
and
conquest
hjorvard
was
chiefly
the
cause
of
the
great
upheaval
a
warlike
message

were
out

new

were
constantly

after
a

of
two
days
the

reached
hleidra
the

the
powerful

this
burg
was
situated
on
the
arm
of
the
sea
which
is
known
under
the
name
of
the
roskilde
fjord
there
they
met
an
equally
powerful
fleet
which
halfdan
had
summoned
the
vessels
were
so
numerous
that
the
sound
between
the

on

was

a

received
hjorvard
his

and
the

who
had
come
with
him
with
great
honor
there
was
great
feasting
and
drinking
for
several
days
here
the
ships
were
joined
by
a
most
imposing
fleet
of
more
than
one
thousand

by

valiant

the
fleets
of
all
the
hersirs

and
those
living
on
the
cattegat
were
waiting
for
the
coming
of
the
fleets
of
the
baltic
when
all
the
vessels
reached
the
lime
fjord
they
found
there
a
fleet
of
over
two
thousand
craft
assembled
the
vessels
composing
the
expedition
were
of
all
sizes
from
the
great
to
the
small
skutas
many
of
these
latter
were
intended
for
shallow

there
were
also
a
very
great
number
of
provision
ships
and
others
to
carry
horses
horses
were
always
used
by
the
vikings
to
reconnoitre
the
land
after
they
had
landed
at
a
council
of
all
the
commanders
it
was
agreed
that
this
great
number
of
vessels
would
divide
into
several
fleets
and
those
into
several
squadrons
and
that
the
roman
empire
should
be
attacked
in
many
places
also
that
several
squadrons
should
sail
for
the
mediterranean

a

special
places
were
fixed
for
vessels
to
meet
before
the
coming
of

after
the
plan
of
campaign
had
been
settled
the
horns
were
sounded
to
order
the
departure
of
the
fleets
they
divided
themselves
as
had
been
arranged
the
red
shields
were
hoisted
on
the
mastheads
and
a
mighty
shout
of
war
rose
from
every
ship
far
and
wide
spreading
like
the
thunder
along
the
sky
or
the
sound
of
a
mighty
torrent
breaking
everything
that
existed
it
bade
defiance
to
the
roman
world
and
empire
it
was
no
easy
matter
for
each
fleet
to
depart
in
the
midst
of
this
great
forest
of
masts
but
the
good
seamanship
of
the
vikings
mastered
the
difficulties

but
few
casualties

northern

ploughing

then
disappearing

some
of

afterwards
a

sorrow
and
anguish
burst
in

couriers
went
to
rome
from
every
one
of
these
to
ask
for
help
but
rome
was
powerless
to
help
them
for
the

were
masters
of
the

and
could
land

wherever
they
pleased
the
country
that
owns

they
used
to
say
the
whole
roman
empire
was
in
dread
and
fear
of
these
vikings
who
were
continually
coming
in
countless
hordes
their
number
seemed
inexhaustible
as
they
poured
from
the
basin
of
the
baltic
and
the
shores
of
norway
year
after
year
and
had
done
so
for
two
centuries
this
last
invasion
of
the
provinces
of
rome
was
one
of
the
most
if
not
the
most
formidable
that
had
ever
taken
place
fire
and
sword
were
carried
everywhere
by
the
norsemen
hjorvard
had
gone
to
make
war
in
britain
while
his
son
ivar
with
his
three
and
a
large
force
had
landed
on
the
northern
shores
of
gaul
where
the
present
boulogne
now
stands
there
the
romans
had
built
strong
fortifications
but
many
a
time
their
centurions
had
seen
with
dismay
the
viking
fleets
pass
before
them
ascend
the
seine
and
take
possession
of
many
islands
before
landing
every
warrior
washed
and
combed
his
hair
and
took
a
good
meal
in
order
to
be
strong
for
the
day
s
fight
and
was
dressed
in
his
best
war
clothes
so
that
if
he
was
fated
to
die
he
might
enter
valhalla
as
befitted
his
rank
the
red
shields
had
been
hoisted
as
a
token
of
war
after
ivar
had
landed
his
forces
and
sent
men
on
horseback
to
reconnoitre
decius
and
curtius
the
centurions
who
commanded
the
stronghold
at
bononia
the
modern
boulogne
seeing
that
the
viking
force
was
much
smaller
than
their
own
resolved
to
attack
them
and
an
overpowering
roman
force
left
their
stronghold
with
the
hope
of
annihilating
the
norsemen
who
had
dared
to
land
before
their
eyes
when
ivar
saw
this
he
said
to
his
men
often
the
more
numerous
host
does
not
gain
the
victory
if
there
are
fearless
men
against
it
many
a
blunt
sword
has
won
the
victory
in
battle
as
we
are
the
weakest
in
number
let
us
arrange
our
host
in
the
wedge
shape
that
was
taught
to
our
forefathers
by
odin
himself
and
we
will
have
besides
another
body
of
men
to
attack
the
romans
or
protect
us
as
may
be
when
decius
saw
this
strategy
carried
out
he
marvelled
greatly
for
the
romans
thought
this
peculiar
war
formation
which
they
called
was
only
known
to
them
he
had
heard
from
different
roman
commanders
that
the
vikings
had
this
knowledge
but
he
had
not
believed
them
and
though
a
moment
before
he
had
boastingly
told
his
soldiers
that
rome
would
soon
hear
of
their
victory
he
became
uneasy
as
he
saw
the
glittering
shields
and
helmets
of
the
vikings
in
their
battle
array
and
the
body
of
archers
and
horsemen
with
shining
swords
who
were
ready
to
go
wherever
sent
he
then
ordered
his
men
to
be
placed
in
formation
when
ivar
and
his
men
saw
this
they
in
their
turn
wondered
how
it
was
that
the
romans
knew
this
formation
and
hjalmar
exclaimed
they
must
have
learned
this
from
our
people
how
could
it
be
otherwise
before
the
battle
ivar
issued
his
orders
saying
our
horsemen
will
remain
on
the
lookout
and
be
ready
to
support
us
or
to
attack
the
enemy
our
archers
will
pour
a
continuous
hail
of
arrows
upon
the
romans
and
our
slingmen
will
do
likewise
with
stones
the
should
be
at
the
apex
of
the
triangle
and
must
be
guarded
by
the
most
skilful
warriors
for
if
it
is
broken
or
opened
especially
in
the
beginning
of
the
battle
it
will
be
most
fatal
to
victory
the
two
other
points
of
the
triangle
must
also
be
very
strongly
guarded
it
is
imperative
that
great
care
be
taken
that
our
locked
formation
be
not
broken
or
even
opened
for
disorder
in
our
midst
would
follow
and
might
lead
to
great
the
agreed
that
as
ivar
was
the
foremost
champion
among
them
he
should
be
at
the
apex
of
the
triangle
with
their
most
valiant
men
for
this
part
of
the
triangle
was
always
the
weakest
spot
of
the
formation
then
ivar
said
let
my
standard
victory
be
moved
forward
and
let
alrek
my
be
surrounded
by
berserks
my
scalds
must
stand
in
the
midst
of
the
and
so
placed
as
to
be
able
to
see
the
conflict
and
praise
the
deed
of
the
combatants
or
of
those
who
fall
in
the
when
alrek
heard
this
he
said
i
have
feared
for
some
time
past
during
the
years
that
this
long
peace
has
lasted
that
i
should
die
of
old
age
on
my
bench
and
i
wished
rather
to
fall
in
battle
if
it
had
thus
been
fated
me
by
the
sigmund
and
sigurd
with
their
two
standards
and
their
valiant
men
were
at
the
two
other
points
of
the
array
hjalmar
and
a
large
body
of
men
were
in
front
of
the
standards
of
ivar
to
protect
the
apex
of
the
triangle
or
to
attack
the
roman
host
if
need
be
if
these
did
not
come
forward
the
were
sounded
on
the
norsemen
s
side
and
the
archers
and
slingmen
advanced
towards
the
romans
and
poured
a
storm
of
missiles
into
them
which
made
many
of
their
host
bite
the
dust
then
a
general
attack
took
place
and
after
a
fierce
conflict
of
spears
and
swords
and
desperate
efforts
of
the
romans
to
protect
themselves
with
their
shields
their
formation
was
broken
after
much
slaughter
and
they
fled
in
every
direction
before
the
victors
curtius
one
of
the
centurions
was
killed
but
decius
and
a
number
of
his
men
escaped
under
the
cover
of
their
fortifications
from
their
walls
the
roman
centurion
looked
upon
his
fallen
soldiers
and
the
victorious
norsemen
and
exclaimed
in
a
voice
full
of
despair
rome
what
has
become
of
thy
might
that
thou
canst
not
conquer
those
men
of
the

they
defy
thy
power
and
laugh
at
thy
legions
sent
against

they
are
here
elsewhere
no
province
is
free
from
their
attacks
even
if
a

its

it
can
not

not

escaped
their
lips
when

wounds
neither
did
they
shrink
when
these
were
dressed
for
the
had
made
a
vow
that
they
like
the
champions
of
hjorvard
would
not
wince
or
utter
cries
of
pain
when
wounded
or
when
their
wounds
were
dressed
after
the
battle
the
slain
norsemen
were
buried
with
their
weapons
and
their
mounds
were
reddened
with
the
blood
of
the
roman
prisoners
who
were
sacrificed
to

ancient
custom
round
a
pole
that
had
been
raised
and
divided
into
four
parts
it
was
distributed
among
the
men
and
many
roman

gallic
captives
were
taken
to
their
ships
to
be
sent

while
the
events
just
recorded
were
taking

the
numerous
fleets
and
squadrons
of
the
norsemen
had
not
been
idle
their
colonies
had
been
reënforced
by
great
accessions
and
those
who
had
been
engaged
in
warfare
had
collected
a
large
booty
including
a
large
number
of
roman
coins
for
they
knew
their
full
value
for
barter
besides
many
of
these
were
to
be
melted
to
be
used
afterwards
in
different
ways
such
as
plates
cups
dishes
etc
it
had
been
agreed
by
some
viking
chiefs
while

spread
terror
as
far
as
the

caused
great
slaughter
there
on
their
return
after

ivar
himself
had
concluded
that
instead
of
returning
to
gotland
he
would
go
and
visit
his
kinsmen
whose
forefathers
had
settled
in
britain
in
the
first
century
accordingly
he
left
the
river
loire
and
sailed
eastward
along
the
shores
of
gaul
visited
some
of
the
gotlanders
who
had
settled
peacefully
near
the
sea
and
on
the
banks
of
some
of
its
rivers
and
asked
them
if
they
wanted
help
of
men
and
ships
the
romans
had
left
them
in
peaceful
possession
of
their
lands
however
thinking
it
more
prudent
to
let
them
alone
than
to
incur
their
enmity
and
that
of
their
kinsmen
who
they
knew
were
relentless
in
their
hatred
after
passing
the
mouth
of
the
thames
upon
whose
banks
were
several
settlements
the
largest
ones
being
where
the
present
greenwich
and
chatham
stand
they
continued
their
voyage
sailing
along
the
eastern
coast
of
britain
which
was
as
flat
as
it
is
and
came
to
the
coast
of
the
shire
of
norfolk
inhabited
by
the
folk
of
the
north
and
cast
anchor
in
an
estuary
or
bay
called
the
wash
the
object
of
ivar
s
visit
in
this
part
of
britain
was
to
see
his
kinsman
grammar
hersir
a
of
his
father
who
ruled
over
a
large
herad
whose
boundary
came
to
the
nearly
two
hundred
years
before
a
of
ivar
had
married
the
daughter
of
one
of
the
hersirs
of
norway
this
was
young
and
adventurous
and
had
settled
somewhat
inland
of
the
bay
in
the
country
which
is
called
cambridgeshire
a
great
many
people
from
the
coast
of
norway
followed
him
and
the
emigration
was
chiefly
from
there
in
those
early
days
that
part
of
britain
was
thinly
settled
by
the
aborigines
a
great
part
of
the
littoral
along
the
north
sea
was
flat
and
swampy
and
the
country
was
covered
with
oak
forests
and
on
account
of
this
was
good
for
shipbuilding
for
that
very
reason
this
settlement
had
been
made
the
poor
aborigines
had
received
these
kindly
and
the
extended
forest
shut
them
up
from
the
romans
who
had
conquered
part
of
the
island
on
the
sea
side
the
settlers
felt
secure
as
they
and
the
norsemen
were
masters
on
the
sea
grammar
s
by
or
burg
stood
near
the
shores
of
the
river
now
called
cam
somewhat
near
the
present
hamlet
of
wilbraham
the
pioneers
and
the
first
norse
settlers
had
chosen
this
peculiar
spot
so
high
up
the
river
that
they
might
feel
safe
from
the
sudden
attacks
of
enemies
sometimes
feuds
broke
out
among
the
norse
families
in
britain
and
their
kinsmen
on
the
baltic
these
would
come
and
claim
the
inheritance
of
those
that
were
dead
and
war
followed
the
here
and
there
was
fortified
high
towers
had
been
built
where
men
had
their
estates
from
their
top
a
good
lookout
was
kept
up
and
chains
were
laid
across
the
river
when
they
feared
hostile
incursions
to
prevent
their
ships
from
ascending
the
stream
the
following
day
after
their
arrival
the
ships
having
the
lightest
draught
specially
built
for
use
in
shallow
water
were
picked
out
and
then
ivar
and
his
started
for
grammar
s
by
they
had
to
take
to
the
oars
as
the
wind
was
very
light
and
the
current
was
against
them
each
craft
had
fifteen
and
sixteen
benches
and
was
consequently
rowed
by
thirty
or
oars
three
men
on
each
oar
while
the
other
men
stood
at
the
prow
and
stern
the
peace
shields
had
been
hoisted
when
night
came
they
let
down
their
anchors
and
raised
their
tents
early
the
following
morning
they
started
and
continued
the
ascent
of
the
stream
they
had
to
row
all
the
way
here
and
there
they
saw
a
settlement
of
the
norsemen
with
cultivated
land
round
them
and
their
ships
lying
at
the
wharves
near
by
finally
they
came
in
sight
of
grammar
s
residence
and
of
the
temple
overlooking
the
river
where
the
worship
of
odin
frey
njord
thor
and
other
gods
took
place
the
structures
were
similar
to
those
of
home
all
of
wood
and
the
might
have
fancied
they
were
in
their
own
country
across
the
sea
when
grammar
whose
young
kinsman
s
fame
had
reached
him
heard
of
ivar
s
arrival
he
sent
messengers
on
board
of
his
ship
and
invited
him
to
come
and
stay
with
him
with
all
his
men
ivar
his
and
all
the
men
of
his
fleet
after
landing
went
to
the
banqueting
hall
and
were
received
with
great
honor
ivar
was
bid
by
grammar
to
sit
on
the
high
seat
opposite
him
and
his
men
were
seated
according
to
their
rank
on
each
side
of
ivar
were
the
men
of
grammar
and
on
that
of
the
latter
were
those
of
ivar
hjalmar
being
seated
on
the
right
of
grammar
and
sigmund
on
his
left
then
sigurd
came
next
and
the
others
drew
lots
for
seats
for
many
were
of
equal
birth
the
hall
was
a
fine
specimen
of
northern
architecture
and
was
somewhat
similar
to
that
of
gudbrand
at
hrafnista
on
engel
the
carvings
represented
the
landing
of
a
body
of
men
on
shore
in
war
attire
coming
to
take
possession
of
land
in
britain
tapestry
hung
along
the
walls
and
a
long
row
of
fine
shields
above
the
seats
encircled
the
hall
grammar
was
a
man
and
according
to
the
custom
of
hersirs
who
had
come
of
mature
age
he
wore
a
long
flowing
beard
which
was
of
a
beautiful
he
was
tall
and
majestic
in
bearing
and
had
the
deep
blue
eyes
of
his
kin
his
chin
and
mouth
showed
great
decision
of
character
but
his
benignant
smile
and
soft
eye
told
of
the
kindliness
of
his
heart
he
ruled
his
land
according
to
the
ancient
customs
of
the
norselands
the
land
had
been
divided
and
was
owned
as
in
the
viking
s
lands
generally
he
was
a
great
sacrificer
and
loved
frey
more
than
all
the
other
gods
and
sacrificed
often
to
him
he
was
a
widower
his
wife
a
daughter
of
the
hersir
of
the
island
of
fyen
in
the
cattegat
having
died
several
years
before
he
had
several
beautiful
daughters
the
eldest
was
named
hildigunn
a
combination
of
the
names
of
two
valkyrias
hild
and
gunn
the
custom
of
joining
two
names
being
not
uncommon
with
the
norsemen
the
others
were
named
brynhild
sigrun
and
hervor
grammar
expressed
his
great
pleasure
in
seeing
his
young
kinsman
and
told
him
that
he
had
fought
by
the
side
of
his
grandfather
and
father
and
pointing
to
a
sword
hanging
over
his
high
seat
with
peace
bands
fastened
around
it
he
said
this
sword
is
called
on
account
of
the
sharpness
and
quality
of
its
blade
and
was
given
to
me
ivar
by
thy
grandfather
when
i
had
just
begun
warfare
as
a
young
lad
and
was
on
board
of
his
own
ship
it
is
a
most
excellent
weapon
and
victory
has
always
followed
it
it
is
an
heirloom
in
our
then
he
inquired
how
hjorvard
and
the
folks
were
in
dear
gotland
in
engel
and
in
old
norway
and
added
that
he
hoped
to
go
and
see
once
more
the
land
of
his
ancestors
before
he
should
go
on
his
burning
journey
to
valhalla
and
lie
under
his
mound
ivar
told
him
of
the
great
deeds
that
had
taken
place
since
all
the
fleets
had
scattered
and
what
he
had
himself
accomplished
in
foreign
lands
well
done
said
grammar
i
can
see
that
thou
art
a
yngling
and
worthy
of
thy
kinsmen
who
are
then
ivar
presented
to
him
two
magnificent
velvet
cloaks
from
greece
a
superb
coat
of
mail
of
exquisite
workmanship
made
by
a
smith
from
gotland
several
brooches
to
fasten
his
cloaks
with
helmets
saxes
and
swords
of
fine
workmanship
a
beautiful
necklace
of
gold
for
hildigunn
and
bracelets
for
his
other
daughters
ivar
noticed
that
the
dress
of
the
women
and
men
the
weapons
and
ornaments
were
of
the
same
style
as
those
worn
by
the
people
in
the
viking
lands
like
the
emigrants
of
our
days
they
had
brought
their
customs
religion
and
fashions
with
them
a
few
jewels
which
had
come
with
the
people
who
had
first
landed
at
wilbraham
were
still
kept
as
family
heirlooms
though
most
of
them
had
been
buried
with
the
dead
these
were
fibulæ
or
brooches
of
cruciform
and
circular
shape
mosaic
and
glass
beads
which
were
worn
by
the
people
in
the
first
and
second
centuries
not
far
from
grammar
s
residence
and
temple
and
overlooking
the
river
was
the
graveyard
of
the
first
norse
settlers
who
had
come
to
that
part
of
britain
there
were
graves
where
the
bodies
had
not
been
burned
in
others
the
burned
bones
were
preserved
in
cinerary
urns
or
in
wooden
buckets
with
bronze
trappings
weapons
jewels
ornaments
of
bronze
tweezers
with
iron
spears
iron
shears
knives
glass
and
mosaic
beads
had
been
put
on
the
pyre
and
fired
or
destroyed
by
its
fire
coins
of
trajan
hadrian
aurelius
maximus
told
the
age
of
the
graveyard
which
was
a
very
exact
counterpart
of
the
burial
places
of
the
mother
country
one
day
while
a
great
feast
was
taking
place
hildigunn
and
her
sisters
came
into
the
hall
she
was
tall
and
slender
her
hair
was
flaxen
falling
gracefully
over
her
shoulders
far
below
her
waist
her
eyes
were
of
a
deep
soft
blue
which
contrasted
charmingly
with
her
delicate
rosy
complexion
she
walked
toward
ivar
and
said
to
him
hail
to
thee
my
kinsman
we
also
are
of
odin
s
kin
hail
you
all
ynglingar
and
skoldungar
and
men
who
are
with
us
here
then
sipping
some
ale
from
the
horn
she
held
in
her
hand
she
handed
it
to
ivar
he
took
the
horn
and
her
hand
at
the
same
time
and
said
to
her
that
she
must
sit
by
him
it
is
not
the
custom
of
vikings
to
drink
in
pair
with
women
replied
hildigunn
ivar
answered
that
it
was
and
that
he
would
rather
change
the
viking
laws
if
it
was
the
case
so
that
he
could
drink
with
her
then
she
sat
down
by
his
side
and
spoke
of
many
things
with
him
during
the
evening
the
poets
of
grammar
recited
the
songs
which
told
of
the
great
deeds
accomplished
by
him
with
hjorvard
or
by
their
ancestors
days
passed
pleasantly
for
ivar
and
his
at
grammar
s
by
for
many
maidens
had
come
around
from
the
surrounding
estates
to
welcome
the
vikings
and
their
presence
made
life
so
much
pleasanter
for
all
every
evening
these
maidens
and
warriors
met
in
the
great
banqueting
hall
these
fair
viking
daughters
in
whose
veins
the
blood
of
the
norsemen
flowed
listened
to
the
scalds
who
had
come
with
ivar
and
recited
the
great
deeds
of
valor
the
vikings
had
accomplished
in
the
expeditions
from
which
they
had
just
returned
and
heard
with
wonder
of
the
escapes
of
ivar
and
of
many
of
his
companions
no
viking
could
tell
himself
of
his
brave
feats
for
it
was
thought
unbecoming
to
do
so
but
they
could
tell
of
the
countries
they
had
seen
and
of
the
people
they
had
met
in
lands
and
when
they
did
the
maidens
listened
to
them
with
wonder
and
admiration
and
their
eyes
were
fixed
upon
those
who
told
of
their
strange
adventures
and
their
cheeks
flushed
with
animation
finally
the
admiration
turned
into
love
without
their
knowing
it
but
there
could
be
no
mistake
for
during
the
day
while
in
the
skemma
they
could
not
help
thinking
all
the
time
of
the
one
they
admired
the
most
they
wished
for
the
evening
entertainment
to
come
so
that
they
might
come
into
the
hall
the
vikings
themselves
especially
ivar
and
his
wished
likewise
for
the
day
to
pass
quickly
one
evening
as
the
brothers
were
by
themselves
and
thought
of
the
beautiful
girls
they
had
met
and
were
talking
of
love
in
a
general
way
ivar
said
what
men
call
love
springs
from
the
mind
for
the
mind
is
the
seat
and
source
of
all
our
thoughts
the
heart
does
not
think
and
can
not
love
it
palpitates
quicker
it
is
true
with
love
but
it
is
only
the
reflection
of
the
mind
there
is
a
beginning
in
love
as
in
everything
else
that
the
gods
have
the
flower
it
must
be
born
first
grow
bud
and
bloom
the
bud
is
the
beginning
of
love
and
when
love
is
young
it
is
fickle
trust
not
love
too
soon
when
it
is
young
for
fickle
is
the
mind
of
man
towards
woman
and
if
one
searches
well
he
will
find
that
many
a
good
maiden
is
fickle
to
man
for
their
hearts
were
shaped
like
a
whirling
wheel
and
fickleness
was
laid
in
their
the
day
of
parting
came
at
last
the
life
shaped
by
the
nornir
had
to
continue
the
future
was
hidden
from
sight
but
what
stories
of
the
budding
of
love
could
be
told
for
many
a
blushing
maiden
had
lost
her
heart
with
a
brave
warrior
and
many
a
viking
had
lost
his
also
chapter
xi
the
daughters
of
ran
it
was
late
in
the
summer
when
ivar
and
hjalmar
who
had
decided
to
cross
the
north
sea
on
the
elidi
and
their
viking
fleet
left
the
coast
of
britain
for
the
baltic
all
on
board
of
the
ships
wondered
if
ægir
and
ran
the
god
and
goddess
of
the
sea
and
their
daughters
would
show
themselves
in
ugly
mood
on
their
way
home
the
people
believed
that
those
who
were
drowned
at
sea
went
to
ran
those
who
died
by
weapons
went
to
valhalla
and
those
who
died
of
natural
death
in
their
beds
or
chairs
went
to
hel
the
people
worshipped
ægir
for
he
governed
the
sea
and
wind
ran
his
wife
received
well
all
shipwrecked
people
in
her
hall
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
had
a
net
with
which
she
caught
men
who
came
out
to
sea
drowned
men
were
sure
to
be
welcomed
by
her
the
wind
and
the
fire
are
the
brothers
of
ægir
the
wind
is
so
strong
that
he
moves
large
oceans
and
stirs
up
his
brother
the
fire
ægir
and
ran
have
nine
beautiful
daughters
who
live
in
the
sea
and
the
waves
are
named
after
them
these
daughters
often
go
three
together
and
the
winds
awake
them
from
their
sleep
they
are
not
partial
to
men
and
are
always
seen
in
storms
all
had
names
emblematic
of
the
waves
they
are
called
himinglœfa
the
heaven
glittering
dufa
the
dove
blodughadda
the
hefring
the
hurling
or
heaving
ud
the
loving
hrönn
the
towering
bylgja
the
billowing
or
swelling
bara
the
lashing
kolga
the
cooling
ægir
and
ran
were
not
to
let
ivar
s
fleet
go
home
quietly
the
ships
were
hardly
out
of
sight
of
land
when
the
sky
became
dark
and
threatening
the
clouds
hung
low
and
moved
with
great
rapidity
the
wind
kept
increasing
in
violence
the
waves
rose
higher
and
higher
and
the
north
sea
was
like
a
sheet
of
white
foam
the
sails
were
reefed
on
board
of
several
vessels
but
ivar
had
like
his
father
made
a
vow
that
he
would
never
reef
a
sail
the
elidi
rose
over
the
waves
as
if
she
were
a
and
was
so
easily
steered
that
the
people
believed
and
declared
that
she
understood
the
human
voice
from
the
southwest
the
wind
shifted
suddenly
to
the
northwest
and
alternate
gusts
of
wind
and
rain
followed
each
other
in
quick
succession
it
is
good
suddenly
exclaimed
hjalmar
that
no
man
knows
his
fate
beforehand
his
mind
is
thus
free
from
anxiety
and
the
day
was
fine
this
morning
answered
ivar
but
after
all
a
day
should
be
praised
at
night
a
woman
after
she
is
buried
a
sword
after
it
is
tried
ice
when
it
has
been
crossed
over
and
a
voyage
after
it
is
those
are
wise
sayings
replied
hjalmar
and
as
the
elidi
and
the
other
ships
were
ploughing
their
way
fast
through
the
waves
ivar
said
to
hjalmar
tell
me
tell
me
of
those
who
wander
over
the
sea
and
pass
their
lives
in
doing
harm
to
many
those
maidens
are
the
daughters
of
ægir
and
ran
replied
hjalmar
they
are
and
slay
men
they
are
seldom
gentle
to
us
people
and
the
wind
arouses
them
from
their
sleep
and
they
look
angrily
at
the
ships
sailing
over
the
sea
it
is
they
that
are
those
mountainous
waves
which
we
who
are
the
maidens
asked
ivar
again
who
walk
over
the
reefs
and
journey
along
the
fjords
and
shores
these
women
have
a
hard
bed
and
make
little
stir
in
calm
hjalmar
replied
these
are
billows
and
waves
daughters
of
ran
they
lay
themselves
on
skerries
their
beds
are
the
rocks
and
the
calm
sea
stirs
them
not
but
lo
when
the
wind
blows
hard
it
rouses
their
anger
and
they
send
the
men
that
are
on
the
deep
to
ran
their
i
fear
said
ivar
by
the
look
of
the
sky
that
we
are
going
to
meet
ægir
and
ran
and
their
daughters
erelong
in
their
angry
the
wind
kept
increasing
the
brother
of
ægir
who
stirs
the
ocean
said
the
wishes
to
see
what
kind
of
men
are
on
board
of
the
elidi
and
other
ships
and
if
ivar
and
his
are
fearless
men
for
as
thou
seest
the
sea
is
becoming
mountain
then
hjalmar
who
was
looking
at
the
wake
made
by
the
ship
said
to
ivar
who
are
those
maidens
that
i
seem
to
see
yonder
they
are
dressed
in
white
have
frowning
looks
their
breasts
heave
with
passion
and
they
are
coming
fast
toward
the
those
are
three
of
the
daughters
of
ægir
and
ran
and
by
their
size
and
fierceness
must
be
hrönn
bylgja
and
hefring
let
us
beware
of
them
for
there
is
anger
in
their
looks
they
are
coming
rapidly
toward
us
and
i
think
they
mean
us
ivar
had
hardly
uttered
these
words
when
there
dashed
a
wave
so
strongly
against
the
elidi
that
it
carried
away
the
gunwales
it
was
hrönn
they
fancied
that
had
come
against
the
ship
then
another
wave
followed
hrönn
it
carried
away
part
of
the
bows
of
the
elidi
it
was
bylgja
right
after
bylgja
in
the
wink
of
an
eye
came
another
wave
that
swamped
the
deck
of
the
ship
and
flung
four
men
overboard
who
were
all
lost
then
hjalmar
said
it
is
hefring
who
has
carried
those
four
men
to
ran
and
hrœsvelg
the
wind
is
flapping
his
wings
with
great
force
at
heaven
s
end
so
that
the
tempest
may
blow
still
it
is
likely
said
ivar
that
some
more
of
our
men
will
visit
ran
for
the
storm
is
increasing
we
shall
not
be
thought
fit
to
come
to
her
hall
and
in
her
presence
unless
we
prepare
ourselves
well
for
her
then
he
cut
asunder
several
large
of
gold
and
divided
them
among
his
men
for
said
he
i
think
it
right
that
every
man
should
carry
some
gold
with
him
and
appear
before
ran
as
befits
the
rank
of
every
man
we
have
cut
the
red
rings
which
the
rich
father
of
hjorvard
owned
before
ægir
slays
shall
be
seen
on
the
guests
in
the
middle
of
the
hall
of
ran
if
we
need
night
quarters
then
in
a
musing
voice
he
added
ran
is
handling
us
roughly
and
has
taken
many
of
my
kin
to
herself
verily
the
land
of
ægir
s
daughter
is
not
always
it
had
become
very
cold
and
ivar
said
fire
and
the
sight
of
the
sun
are
the
best
things
among
the
sons
of
men
also
their
good
health
and
a
blameless
life
if
they
can
keep
them
it
is
better
to
be
merry
than
to
be
whatever
may
come
to
hand
glad
and
cheerful
should
every
man
be
until
he
meets
his
the
fleet
was
behaving
splendidly
in
the
tempest
the
ships
rode
over
the
waves
as
if
they
had
been
birds
of
storms
the
of
sigmund
and
sigurd
came
within
hailing
distance
of
the
elidi
and
ivar
shouted
to
them
have
the
daughters
of
ran
treated
you
roughly
yes
shouted
each
in
turn
several
of
our
men
have
gone
to
the
hall
of
ran
and
we
have
prepared
ourselves
for
this
journey
for
we
are
fearless
the
wind
shifted
and
the
ships
were
driven
toward
the
dangerous
coast
of
norway
and
came
in
sight
of
the
shores
of
a
large
island
with
great
weird
cliffs
hanging
over
the
sea
the
storm
seemed
then
to
be
at
its
height
the
vessels
had
to
run
before
the
wind
every
sail
had
been
unreefed
to
allow
them
to
make
their
utmost
speed
so
that
they
might
not
be
swamped
by
the
huge
seas
that
advanced
toward
them
from
behind
witchcraft
moves
the
storm
cried
hjalmar
and
we
had
better
sail
under
the
lee
of
the
island
for
protection
for
we
can
not
contend
with
ægir
nor
ran
and
their
the
elidi
and
the
other
vessels
came
to
the
leeward
of
the
island
where
it
was
comparatively
calm
and
there
the
vikings
waited
for
better
weather
during
the
night
the
storm
abated
and
the
wind
became
fair
on
the
morrow
they
sailed
away
and
had
good
weather
for
a
time
but
the
wind
became
stronger
and
stronger
after
they
were
far
out
to
sea
and
they
were
once
more
in
the
midst
of
a
great
storm
the
daughters
of
ran
once
again
were
roused
and
the
waves
became
very
high
and
threatening
then
a
arose
and
the
snow
fell
so
thickly
that
the
men
in
the
stern
and
the
prow
of
the
ships
could
not
see
each
other
and
the
waves
broke
over
the
ships
and
filled
them
with
water
so
the
men
had
to
bale
for
their
lives
he
who
travels
widely
steadily
said
ivar
must
meet
good
and
that
is
certain
answered
hjalmar
now
is
the
time
for
brave
men
to
be
tried
and
show
that
they
do
not
fear
the
great
waves
continued
to
dash
against
the
elidi
and
ivar
burst
forth
into
a
chant
singing
we
the
renowned
warriors
of
chiefs
have
come
on
the
deep
and
land
is
out
of
sight
and
i
see
all
the
men
that
defend
the
elidi
baling
the
the
snow
fell
so
fast
and
thick
that
they
could
not
discern
anything
the
night
came
and
those
who
were
not
on
the
watch
put
themselves
in
their
leather
bags
to
sleep
and
thus
protect
themselves
against
wet
and
cold
ivar
and
hjalmar
steered
the
elidi
alternately
toward
morning
they
thought
they
saw
nine
valkyrias
and
with
shining
spears
riding
in
the
air
over
their
ships
and
then
the
storm
ceased
they
have
come
to
protect
us
and
hush
the
storm
the
decree
of
the
nornir
in
regard
to
our
death
is
not
yet
to
be
fulfilled
said
ivar
soon
after
they
saw
land
but
as
it
was
all
covered
with
snow
they
could
not
make
out
the
place
as
it
is
very
difficult
for
mariners
to
do
when
snow
covers
the
ground
then
the
fleet
hove
to
for
a
while
and
afterward
sailed
cautiously
along
the
coast
keeping
out
of
the
way
of
the
breakers
and
islands
which
rose
only
to
the
level
of
the
sea
they
came
to
the
mouth
of
a
fjord
and
then
recognized
the
land
and
saw
that
they
had
been
driven
out
of
their
course
continuing
their
voyage
southward
until
they
came
to
engel
they
were
received
by
gudbrand
and
sigrid
with
great
demonstrations
of
joy
after
a
short
stay
they
separated
each
going
his
own
way

romantic
adventures
of
sigurd
sigurd
with
his
own
sailed
northward
and
landed
on
a
large
island
where
there
were
many
inhabitants
he
wished
to
visit
a
of
his
called
ingebjorg
whom
he
loved
dearly
and
who
received
him
with
many
demonstrations
of
joy
he
was
very
proud
of
her
for
she
was
extremely
beautiful
had
dark
brown
hair
and
hazel
eyes
and
was
gifted
with
all
the
accomplishments
that
belonged
to
women
as
well
as
possessed
of
a
gentle
and
lovable
character
in
the
evening
he
betook
himself
to
a
large
hall
where
there
was
an
elaborate
entertainment
and
there
were
many
guests
present
he
was
enthusiastically
received
for
many
had
heard
of
him
a
very
skilful
performer
was
playing
on
the
harp
and
sigurd
enjoyed
it
greatly
so
long
was
it
since
he
had
heard
aught
but
the
clangor
of
battle
and
the
roar
of
the
winds
and
waves
near
him
sat
three
charming
maidens
fair
to
look
upon
with
whom
he
talked
much
their
names
were
thordis
ragnild
and
thorana
thordis
was
beautiful
and
had
charming
little
ways
of
her
own
she
was
noticeably
dignified
in
manner
had
a
graceful
figure
was
dressed
coquettishly
and
possessed
an
exquisite
pair
of
bluish
eyes
which
seemed
the
incarnation
of
love
she
was
every
inch
a
hersir
s
daughter
and
was
a
great
favorite
among
the
vikings
to
whom
her
liberal
ways
and
kind
heart
as
well
as
her
beauty
and
accomplishments
made
her
extremely
attractive
ragnild
was
twenty
years
old
tall
and
slender
her
hair
was
fair
and
silky
her
complexion
as
delicate
as
that
of
the
apple
blossom
the
blue
dress
she
wore
that
evening
was
in
delightful
contrast
to
her
fair
skin
and
hair
her
big
blue
eyes
were
like
nests
filled
with
little
cupids
ready
to
send
their
arrows
right
and
left
into
the
hearts
of
those
who
came
within
their
range
thorana
the
shortest
of
the
three
was
years
of
age
and
possessed
a
very
graceful
figure
with
a
pair
of
small
eyes
full
of
mischief
her
head
was
adorned
with
thick
chestnut
hair
of
rich
color
with
streaks
as
of
burnished
gold
here
and
there
she
was
full
of
life
had
great
individuality
and
in
general
had
very
much
her
own
way
as
she
was
an
only
daughter
all
three
maidens
loved
the
society
of
scalds
and
warriors
the
mothers
of
these
three
girls
were
handsome
women
and
all
had
brought
up
their
daughters
with
tender
love
and
care
and
taught
them
all
the
accomplishments
which
were
required
of
maidens
of
high
birth
thordis
had
lost
her
father
and
she
and
her
mother
mourned
his
death
greatly
she
had
a
brother
a
most
charming
and
handsome
fellow
whom
sigurd
liked
at
once
a
very
few
days
after
this
entertainment
thordis
thorana
ragnild
and
sigurd
had
become
fast
friends
and
called
themselves
cousins
they
saw
each
other
every
day
and
met
often
in
the
banqueting
hall
in
the
evening
one
day
sigurd
received
a
message
from
a
friend
written
in
mystic
runes
in
which
thordis
whose
home
was
elsewhere
was
casually
mentioned
as
visiting
on
the
island
and
the
message
also
said
that
she
held
large
estates
in
her
own
right
this
latter
part
of
the
message
did
not
please
sigurd
for
he
liked
thordis
for
her
own
sake
and
her
charming
ways
one
day
when
thordis
was
seated
by
the
side
of
her
mother
sigurd
appeared
and
after
saluting
them
in
his
usual
way
he
said
with
a
laughing
expression
cousin
thordis
i
have
received
a
message
written
in
mystic
runes
in
which
your
name
is
mentioned
it
is
sad
news
to
me
indeed
i
wish
i
had
never
received
at
these
words
thordis
s
big
beautiful
eyes
became
twice
as
large
as
they
were
before
and
with
an
inquiring
and
startled
look
she
said
cousin
sigurd
i
insist
on
knowing
what
your
friend
has
written
and
who
he
no
said
sigurd
you
will
never
know
who
he
then
what
did
he
say
asked
thordis
i
insist
upon
if
you
wish
to
know
replied
sigurd
i
will
tell
you
that
he
wrote
that
you
were
a
lovely
maiden
but
that
you
possessed
great
wealth
in
your
own
right
and
this
last
part
was
sad
news
indeed
to
me
i
wish
i
had
never
received
the
message
i
never
cared
or
knew
if
you
were
rich
and
i
like
you
for
your
own
charming
ways
and
for
yourself
well
replied
thordis
with
apparently
a
feeling
of
great
relief
your
friend
has
deceived
you
to
which
assertion
her
mother
nodded
assent
certainly
not
in
the
first
part
of
the
message
where
he
says
you
are
a
charming
girl
said
sigurd
there
also
he
made
a
mistake
she
replied
laughing
but
never
mind
cousin
the
following
day
ragnild
thordis
and
her
brother
with
sigurd
drove
up
to
eagle
mountain
from
which
a
beautiful
view
of
the
sea
of
the
burg
and
of
the
island
could
be
seen
every
day
that
passed
away
bound
the
friendship
of
these
three
maidens
with
sigurd
stronger
than
before
alas
a
day
came
when
ragnild
s
mother
who
was
also
a
visitor
on
the
island
received
a
runic
message
from
home
that
they
must
return
poor
ragnild
did
not
like
it
she
wanted
to
stay
for
it
was
so
pleasant
on
the
island
sigurd
was
at
least
no
better
pleased
nor
were
thordis
and
thorana
and
it
was
with
great
regret
that
they
parted
they
followed
her
to
the
ship
but
not
before
they
promised
to
meet
again
in
the
winter
ragnild
was
very
much
missed
by
them
in
all
the
entertainments
that
followed
and
sigurd
thought
often
afterwards
of
lovely
ragnild
one
day
sigurd
proposed
to
thordis
and
thorana
a
moonlight
drive
as
the
weather
was
beautiful
and
at
that
time
the
beginning
of
september
the
moon
was
very
brilliant
it
was
agreed
that
two
other
friends
were
to
go
they
were
pleasant
men
full
of
life
and
jollity
it
was
a
beautiful
night
not
a
cloud
was
seen
in
the
sky
the
full
moon
queen
of
the
night
shone
in
all
her
glory
the
stars
glittered
and
twinkled
brilliantly
in
the
deep
azure
of
the
firmament
waiting
in
front
of
the
skemma
or
bower
of
thordis
and
thorana
stood
a
splendid
carriage
in
shape
drawn
by
two
of
the
fleetest
horses
known
in
the
country
the
horses
were
very
restive
they
champed
the
bit
pawed
the
ground
and
snorted
incessantly
two
men
held
the
fiery
steeds
firmly
by
the
bridle
and
it
took
all
their
might
and
in
despite
of
this
they
could
hardly
prevent
them
from
getting
away
from
them
sigurd
and
his
two
companions
were
anxiously
waiting
for
the
coming
of
the
two
vikings
daughters
thorana
and
thordis
at
last
made
their
appearance
clad
in
their
warm
graceful
evening
cloaks
their
faces
were
radiant
with
expectation
for
both
had
been
looking
forward
to
that
drive
by
moonlight
and
the
sail
on
eagle
lake
and
were
anticipating
great
delight
accompanying
them
was
a
friend
a
woman
who
was
to
act
as
we
say
in
our
modern
way
as
a
chaperon
she
was
very
skilled
in
embroidery
and
had
great
talent
in
representing
on
canvas
all
kinds
of
scenery
views
of
the
sea
or
landscape
either
weird
or
charming
they
had
hardly
entered
the
carriage
and
had
had
no
time
to
be
seated
when
the
horses
becoming
apparently
unmanageable
dashed
forward
and
as
they
rounded
the
corner
of
the
way
leading
to
the
high
road
the
vehicle
seemed
fairly
to
bend
like
a
bow
and
was
on
the
point
of
being
overturned
fortunately
the
great
skill
of
the
driver
was
equal
to
the
emergency
then
the
carriage
fairly
flew
over
the
ground
an
irresistible
power
seeming
to
impel
the
fiery
steeds
forward
in
their
furious
speed
the
excitement
was
very
great
among
all
sigurd
exclaimed
that
even
sleipnir
the
horse
of
odin
could
not
go
faster
neither
could
clouds
pushed
before
the
tempest
fly
forward
more
quickly
the
moonlight
imparted
a
weird
appearance
to
the
landscape
the
strange
shadows
of
the
trees
seemed
to
play
all
round
them
and
the
shadows
of
the
rocks
and
of
the
hills
appeared
and
disappeared
one
after
another
in
quick
succession
like
phantoms
or
ghosts
here
and
there
they
entered
a
part
of
the
road
densely
wooded
and
where
the
rays
of
the
moon
could
not
penetrate
then
came
a
less
dense
part
of
the
forest
where
tall
pines
extended
their
shadows
out
upon
the
road
and
over
themselves
then
groves
of
aspens
came
in
sight
with
their
leaves
quivering
and
frolicking
as
so
many
merry
maids
the
heaven
was
their
banqueting
hall
the
stars
their
lights
and
the
murmur
of
the
wind
the
music
all
were
speechless
and
at
the
speed
of
the
coursers
and
the
unearthly
beauty
of
all
that
passed
swiftly
before
them
but
once
in
a
while
an
exclamation
of
delight
or
of
wonderment
escaped
from
the
lips
of
thordis
and
thorana
sigurd
who
had
been
silent
for
some
time
suddenly
seemed
to
see
far
off
in
the
sky
nine
valkyrias
riding
in
the
air
on
fiery
white
steeds
skuld
the
norn
personifying
the
future
was
preceding
them
and
sigurd
wondered
why
skuld
was
with
them
and
what
her
appearance
forebode
she
accompanied
them
evidently
to
see
that
the
decrees
of
the
nornir
who
had
shaped
the
lives
of
each
of
them
at
their
birth
should
be
fulfilled
at
the
particular
time
what
were
those
decrees
no
human
being
knew
then
sigurd
said
to
himself
it
was
well
ordered
that
no
one
should
know
his
fate
he
did
not
know
that
they
had
fated
him
to
be
in
love
with
thorana
or
thordis
suddenly
the
valkyrias
and
skuld
appeared
to
vanish
from
his
gaze
as
the
carriage
sped
along
the
horses
ran
faster
than
before
it
seemed
hardly
possible
that
the
axles
could
stand
the
strain
put
upon
them
such
was
the
rattling
that
every
part
of
the
vehicle
seemed
on
the
point
of
coming
to
pieces
all
shouted
that
they
did
not
mind
that
the
wild
fun
would
be
still
greater
than
ever
in
a
word
the
excitement
had
rendered
every
one
perfectly
reckless
of
danger
why
should
the
daughters
of
viking
heroes
be
afraid
exclaimed
thordis
and
thorana
shouted
at
the
top
of
her
voice
it
is
good
that
our
mothers
are
not
with
us
my
mother
would
have
died
of
fright
or
faint
and
then
we
should
have
missed
all
our
glimpses
of
eagle
lake
were
finally
seen
through
the
foliage
of
the
trees
and
soon
afterwards
they
stopped
before
a
solitary
cabin
near
its
shores
their
horses
fairly
covered
with
foam
every
one
declared
that
never
had
he
driven
so
fast
or
seen
such
superb
driving
or
been
so
excited
in
his
life
in
a
few
moments
two
boats
were
seen
gliding
out
upon
the
waters
of
eagle
lake
which
was
nestled
in
the
midst
of
wooded
hills
while
yonder
was
eagle
mountain
towering
above
all
in
one
boat
were
sigurd
and
thorana
in
the
other
were
thordis
and
her
two
friends
sigurd
wished
that
thordis
had
been
also
in
his
boat
the
scene
was
most
enchanting
not
a
ripple
was
seen
on
the
water
which
the
moon
had
transformed
into
a
mirror
in
which
the
stars
coquettishly
looked
at
themselves
while
images
of
the
hills
and
trees
were
reflected
along
the
shores
o
mother
earth
said
sigurd
to
himself
as
he
contemplated
that
night
how
beautiful
thou
art
when
the
moon
rules
over
thee
instead
of
the
sun
the
moon
gives
us
the
night
the
sun
the
day
some
say
that
the
nights
were
created
for
the
sons
of
men
to
sleep
but
if
it
is
so
why
should
the
nights
be
so
beautiful
to
behold
when
the
moon
shines
and
the
stars
tremble
and
glitter
in
the
blue
of
the
sky
do
not
the
nightingales
sing
their
songs
of
love
at
night
when
the
moon
is
their
sun
love
was
born
of
the
night
the
nights
of
the
moon
are
the
lover
s
days
for
the
moon
shines
upon
them
and
kisses
them
with
her
radiant
and
soft
thorana
insisted
on
rowing
herself
her
graceful
figure
bent
forward
and
backward
at
each
stroke
of
the
oars
her
cousin
sigurd
silently
admiring
her
all
the
time
their
companion
enlivened
the
time
by
his
bright
conversation
and
the
recital
of
his
numerous
adventures
for
he
had
been
in
many
distant
countries
and
his
anecdotes
were
full
of
wit
the
weird
echo
repeated
their
words
in
the
deep
silence
of
that
night
which
was
only
disturbed
at
intervals
by
the
falling
of
the
oars
upon
the
water
the
two
boats
for
a
while
drew
wide
apart
and
their
occupants
amused
themselves
by
listening
to
the
echo
once
sigurd
thought
he
saw
hugin
and
munin
the
ravens
of
odin
flying
above
his
head
on
their
way
to
valhalla
to
tell
the
ruler
of
hosts
all
that
was
happening
in
the
world
then
again
appeared
to
him
the
nine
valkyrias
with
skuld
who
had
followed
them
all
the
way
their
spears
glittered
in
the
moonlight
skuld
s
hair
sent
rays
of
light
out
over
the
night
for
a
while
she
hovered
over
their
boat
and
then
threw
down
upon
the
earth
a
superb
ball
of
fire
a
shooting
star
then
with
the
valkyrias
she
disappeared
in
the
direction
of
the
well
of
urd
every
day
the
nornir
take
the
holy
water
from
the
well
and
mixing
it
with
the
clay
that
lies
round
it
pour
it
over
the
ash
tree
yggdrasil
that
the
branches
may
not
dry
up
or
decay
when
the
two
boats
came
close
together
again
sigurd
saw
two
shadows
reflected
in
the
water
more
beautiful
to
him
than
those
of
stars
and
of
all
that
had
been
reflected
in
the
water
since
odin
had
made
the
world
they
were
the
shadows
of
thorana
and
of
thordis
their
beautiful
faces
their
graceful
forms
their
long
hair
were
like
an
apparition
from
the
deep
it
was
as
if
the
two
beautiful
daughters
of
ægir
and
ran
dufa
the
dove
and
ud
the
loving
had
come
to
see
the
men
who
were
in
the
boats
sigurd
remained
before
the
sight
when
by
a
motion
of
the
boat
the
shadow
disappeared
never
to
reappear
on
the
beautiful
waters
of
eagle
lake
and
in
a
short
time
they
found
themselves
once
more
on
the
shore
sigurd
mentioned
to
no
one
that
he
had
beheld
valkyrias
with
skuld
and
the
beautiful
shadows
of
thorana
and
thordis
but
all
these
visions
had
made
a
deep
impression
on
his
mind
and
he
remained
thoughtful
all
the
way
home
the
following
day
he
made
a
sacrifice
to
the
goddess
var
who
as
we
have
said
listens
to
the
vows
of
love
men
make
but
no
one
ever
heard
of
that
vow
but
we
may
safely
say
that
the
drive
that
beautiful
night
and
the
row
on
eagle
lake
was
never
forgotten
by
any
of
those
who
were
there
as
long
as
they
lived
a
few
days
after
the
events
we
have
just
mentioned
thorana
and
thordis
made
ready
to
go
to
their
respective
homes
the
last
evening
of
their
stay
saw
the
same
party
together
in
the
hall
where
they
met
first
nothing
save
death
could
have
prevented
sigurd
from
being
present
the
following
morning
all
met
on
board
of
the
ship
that
was
to
take
his
two
lovely
cousins
away
from
the
island
a
host
of
friends
came
to
bid
them
all
apparently
happy
for
none
had
yet
realized
how
they
would
miss
each
other
and
the
good
time
they
had
all
had
and
that
regrets
were
soon
to
follow
and
all
wondered
if
all
of
them
would
meet
again
they
parted
with
many
expressions
of
love
and
friendship
and
the
following
day
a
messenger
came
and
handed
to
sigurd
a
message
written
in
mystic
runes
it
was
from
his
cousins
who
had
written
it
on
their
way
home
these
magic
words
were
with
best
love
from
your
cousins
and
a
flush
of
joy
overspread
his
face
when
he
read
this
loving
message
he
immediately
sent
a
messenger
to
them
with
another
message
telling
of
his
lonely
feelings
sigurd
felt
utterly
wretched
after
the
departure
of
his
two
cousins
though
they
were
to
meet
again
a
feeling
of
intense
loneliness
came
over
him
all
that
was
bright
and
cheerful
in
the
island
had
gone
the
wind
moaned
the
waves
as
they
struck
the
shores
seemed
to
sing
mournfully
in
his
ears
thy
three
cousins
are
gone
the
rocky
cliffs
will
see
them
no
he
even
dreaded
to
pass
the
skemma
where
they
had
stayed
no
maiden
could
cheer
him
for
in
his
eyes
none
were
so
lovely
and
accomplished
as
thorana
ragnild
and
thordis
he
whiled
away
the
time
by
writing
on
birch
bark
a
saga
in
which
he
recounted
all
that
had
happened
on
the
island
finally
he
concluded
to
depart
and
after
sailing
a
few
days
he
came
to
a
burg
where
a
by
the
name
of
thorkel
and
he
had
been
brought
up
together
but
thorkel
had
been
dead
for
several
years
sigurd
wanted
to
see
his
grave
and
after
landing
and
telling
his
errand
to
the
people
he
went
towards
the
mound
where
thorkel
and
his
wife
lay
silently
side
by
side
they
had
been
married
but
a
short
time
ere
skuld
snapped
asunder
the
thread
that
measured
the
days
of
their
lives
he
ascended
the
mound
and
murmured
to
himself
here
thorkel
and
his
wife
lie
the
thinking
minds
that
guided
and
moved
their
actions
during
their
lives
have
left
them
helpless
motionless
and
without
life
they
looking
up
he
saw
a
butterfly
of
brilliant
colors
with
wings
of
gold
and
rainbow
tints
full
of
life
going
merrily
from
one
flower
to
another
drinking
of
their
nectar
whilst
watching
his
joyous
course
sigurd
exclaimed
musingly
all
life
is
ephemeral
man
and
woman
like
this
butterfly
and
the
flower
are
but
the
creatures
of
a
day
in
the
immensity
of
time
and
in
the
world
which
the
gods
have
made
what
a
beautiful
life
is
that
of
the
butterfly
he
lives
in
the
air
his
life
is
that
of
love
and
immortality
he
spends
his
days
in
caressing
and
kissing
flowers
and
becomes
intoxicated
with
their
sweetness
like
love
he
feeds
on
love
as
soon
as
he
has
fulfilled
his
destiny
and
filled
brimful
the
cup
of
love
and
drunk
it
he
dies
as
a
brilliant
meteor
that
burst
into
life
for
an
instant
like
the
twinkling
of
a
star
that
never
returns
thus
the
flower
is
born
to
show
her
tempting
beauty
her
sweetness
and
intoxicating
nectar
to
the
butterfly
the
flower
was
created
for
the
butterfly
and
the
butterfly
for
the
flower
so
were
man
and
woman
created
for
one
another
and
to
love
each
other
and
like
love
their
minds
are
immortal
short
is
the
life
of
the
butterfly
and
of
the
flower
but
their
existence
in
the
immensity
of
time
is
apparently
not
shorter
than
that
of
man
if
the
lives
of
the
butterfly
and
the
flower
are
ephemeral
so
also
is
the
life
of
man
in
the
immensity
of
time
since
the
great
void
the
lives
of
all
created
things
appear
to
the
gods
of
the
same
duration
man
is
born
ushered
into
the
present
and
then
into
the
future
and
thenceforth
belongs
to
the
past
we
are
tossed
said
sigurd
on
the
sea
of
life
like
a
rudderless
ship
and
we
sail
from
day
to
day
towards
the
unknown
called
by
us
the
future
not
knowing
where
we
are
going
nor
how
the
nornir
have
shaped
our
lives
always
hoping
and
hoping
for
something
we
have
not
been
able
to
in
this
reflective
mood
of
mind
sigurd
left
the
mound
under
which
lay
two
hearts
which
had
been
bound
together
by
love
during
their
lives
and
returned
to
his
ship
wondering
what
were
the
number
of
days
the
nornir
had
decreed
at
his
birth
he
should
live
and
also
if
he
would
ever
find
a
woman
that
he
would
love
so
much
as
to
be
impelled
to
ask
her
to
become
his
wife
then
he
sailed
for
dampstadir
and
there
met
ivar
and
his
two
waiting
for
him
chapter
xiii
a
voyage
to
the
caspian
the
following
spring
ivar
and
his
made
preparations
to
go
to
the
caspian
sea
by
the
volga
they
had
sent
word
to
several
of
their
young
kinsmen
asking
them
if
they
would
join
them
in
their
voyage
the
proposal
had
been
accepted
with
eagerness
by
them
all
for
most
of
those
to
whom
the
invitation
had
been
sent
had
never
gone
so
far
south
and
they
longed
to
see
the
lands
of
which
they
had
heard
so
much
or
from
which
so
many
costly
things
came
but
two
or
three
among
those
invited
had
been
there
before
to
trade
and
had
made
on
their
return
great
profits
on
their
goods
and
they
wished
to
try
their
luck
again
it
was
not
a
small
undertaking
to
make
a
voyage
to
the
caspian
for
it
was
tedious
and
took
a
long
time
ivar
chose
three
vessels
of
very
light
draught
that
could
sail
easily
on
the
rivers
of
the
present
russia
leading
to
that
sea
special
vessels
were
built
for
such
voyages
and
the
models
of
these
craft
were
beautiful
and
could
not
even
be
improved
upon
for
that
sort
of
navigation
one
vessel
very
much
like
those
of
ivar
was
found
at
tune
in
norway
and
can
be
seen
at
christiania
provisions
were
collected
among
which
was
a
great
deal
of
hard
bread
very
much
like
that
used
in
scandinavia
various
articles
necessary
for
barter
were
also
collected
such
as
scales
and
weights
a
great
quantity
of
gold
spiral
rods
of
certain
size
and
weight
which
were
to
be
cut
into
smaller
or
larger
pieces
if
necessary
and
then
weighed
for
the
norsemen
had
no
coins
and
these
rings
or
pieces
were
the
medium
of
exchange
their
scale
of
value
was
according
to
weight
their
intercourse
with
rome
however
had
made
them
acquainted
with
roman
coins
of
gold
and
silver
and
they
knew
exactly
their
worth
and
often
brought
them
home
and
kept
them
until
they
visited
again
the
roman
province
they
also
had
a
measure
called
an
ell
two
feet
in
length
to
measure
the
beautiful
fabrics
they
intended
to
buy
and
also
a
measure
for
wine
for
they
were
to
bring
back
wines
with
them
a
man
named
ulf
was
to
go
with
them
he
was
familiar
with
the
navigation
of
the
dnieper
the
don
and
the
volga
and
had
sailed
several
times
from
the
baltic
to
the
black
sea
he
had
lived
chiefly
upon
the
river
don
where
he
had
a
large
trading
establishment
he
was
a
great
trader
and
whose
business
was
to
go
on
trading
voyages
to
various
countries
sometimes
he
went
by
sea
at
other
times
by
land
he
was
an
old
friend
of
hjorvard
who
often
ordered
him
to
buy
goods
for
him
and
had
been
very
often
to
gotland
ulf
was
just
the
man
for
such
an
expedition
and
the
and
their
friends
congratulated
themselves
on
his
going
with
them
in
the
beginning
of
june
as
soon
as
the
ice
allowed
them
to
sail
they
left
dampstadir
and
sailed
through
the
gulf
of
finland
thence
after
a
difficult
navigation
through
lakes
and
rivers
and
some
hard
rowing
they
reached
the
great
river
volga
and
descending
the
stream
they
came
to
a
place
called
novgrad
a
great
mart
where
a
fair
was
held
once
a
year
in
summer
novgrad
was
in
the
great
realm
of
holmgard
and
they
found
there
many
friends
for
the
people
were
of
the
same
kindred
many
vikings
had
married
the
daughters
of
the
holmgard
people
and
much
intercourse
took
place
between
them
and
the
norsemen
both
peoples
had
in
common
the
same
religious
belief
during
the
fair
many
kinds
of
people
were
to
be
seen
there
with
their
wares
they
came
from
the
caucasus
from
the
ural
mountains
from
the
shores
of
the
caspian
from
turkestan
even
from
china
and
many
other
lands
slaves
were
also
sold
at
novgrad
in
the
peace
reigned
at
the
novgrad
fair
as
it
did
at
all
the
fairs
of
the
norsemen
or
at
the
temple
or
assemblies
of
the
people
no
strife
or
shedding
of
blood
was
allowed
to
take
place
and
no
one
was
molested
ivar
and
his
friends
bought
nothing
at
novgrad
intending
to
come
back
and
do
so
on
their
return
from
novgrad
they
sailed
down
the
volga
using
their
oars
when
there
was
no
wind
they
stopped
here
and
there
at
several
places
and
were
well
received
everywhere
while
on
board
every
one
of
the
crew
had
to
be
cook
for
it
was
then
the
custom
of
traders
not
to
have
cooks
all
the
messmates
drawing
lots
to
see
which
of
them
should
do
the
cooking
each
day
all
shipmates
also
had
to
drink
together
and
a
tub
with
a
lid
over
it
stood
near
the
mast
for
this
purpose
when
finally
they
reached
the
caspian
without
any
serious
mishaps
there
was
great
rejoicing
on
board
ulf
was
the
recipient
of
many
praises
for
his
skilful
pilotage
but
the
most
difficult
part
of
the
journey
was
not
yet
of
crossing
the
caspian
to
the
persian
shores
and
the
ascent
of
the
oxus
river
remained
to
be
done
before
undertaking
the
second
part
of
the
voyage
the
ships
were
drawn
ashore
scraped
repaired
and
painted
for
their
bottoms
had
become
foul
during
those
days
the
vikings
spent
much
of
their
time
practising
athletic
games
when
they
were
ashore
for
on
no
account
were
these
exercises
to
be
neglected
when
the
ships
were
ready
they
crossed
the
caspian
without
encountering
one
of
those
storms
that
make
the
water
of
that
shallow
sea
so
full
of
shoals
dangerous
to
mariners
and
after
landing
they
wondered
much
at
the
people
they
saw
for
they
differed
greatly
from
the
vikings
they
worshipped
the
sun
and
fire
some
wore
large
turbans
like
the
turks
of
were
very
industrious
and
many
led
a
nomadic
life
with
their
herds
their
women
were
beautiful
and
the
men
were
courteous
and
hospitable
the
vikings
bought
a
good
deal
of
beautiful
velvet
which
they
called
pell
and
much
rich
cloth
embroidered
with
gold
and
silver
brocades
and
also
superb
linen
tablecloths
and
napkins
they
ascended
afterward
the
river
oxus
the
ascent
of
which
was
very
tedious
the
current
was
strong
and
against
them
but
no
one
tried
to
molest
them
and
every
one
was
anxious
to
barter
with
them
there
they
bought
silk
goods
and
velvets
and
spent
the
beginning
of
the
winter
on
the
river
and
the
later
winter
months
on
the
caspian
whence
they
sailed
and
rowed
up
the
volga
before
the
melting
of
the
snow
and
ice
in
the
north
and
by
the
time
these
had
melted
and
swelled
the
stream
and
made
the
current
very
rapid
they
were
far
up
here
they
waited
until
the
river
should
have
fallen
to
its
usual
size
remaining
all
the
time
on
board
of
their
ships
spending
their
days
in
playing
chess
or
gambling
with
dice
for
almost
all
the
vikings
were
great
gamblers
their
voyage
northward
was
far
more
tedious
than
that
southward
it
was
necessary
to
place
three
men
at
each
oar
on
account
of
the
current
and
the
end
of
september
found
them
once
more
in
the
baltic
with
their
ships
loaded
with
precious
merchandise
hjorvard
and
the
gotlanders
were
delighted
to
see
ivar
and
all
his
companions
back
not
a
single
death
had
occurred
during
the
voyage
ulf
had
had
an
eye
to
business
and
a
good
part
of
the
cargo
belonged
to
him
ivar
presented
his
father
with
several
casks
of
wine
and
many
precious
objects
and
to
his
mother
he
gave
costly
woollen
velvets
and
silk
stuff
the
fame
of
ivar
had
spread
far
and
wide
all
over
the
land
scalds
in
the
halls
of
hersirs
recounted
his
brilliant
warlike
exploits
he
was
very
mature
for
his
age
and
gifted
with
great
tact
people
said
he
would
be
exactly
like
his
father
he
had
reached
the
age
when
parents
think
about
looking
for
a
wife
for
their
sons
one
morning
accordingly
hjorvard
called
ivar
and
said
to
him
listen
to
what
i
am
going
to
tell
thee
we
have
been
told
frey
had
seated
himself
on
hlidskjalf
the
high
seat
from
which
odin
could
see
over
all
worlds
when
he
looked
to
the
north
he
saw
on
an
estate
or
farm
a
large
and
fine
house
towards
which
a
woman
was
walking
when
she
lifted
her
arms
to
open
the
door
a
light
shone
from
them
on
the
sea
and
the
air
and
all
the
worlds
were
brightened
by
her
this
woman
as
thou
knowest
was
gerd
the
daughter
of
gymir
by
his
wife
orboda
and
was
the
most
beautiful
of
all
women
frey
s
great
boldness
in
sitting
down
on
the
holy
seat
was
thus
punished
for
he
went
away
full
of
sorrow
having
fallen
deeply
in
love
with
her
when
he
returned
home
he
did
not
speak
nor
could
he
sleep
or
drink
and
no
one
dared
to
question
him
then
njord
called
skirnir
the
page
of
frey
and
told
him
to
go
to
him
and
ask
frey
with
whom
he
was
so
angry
that
he
would
not
speak
to
anyone
skirnir
obeyed
though
unwillingly
and
when
he
came
to
frey
he
asked
him
why
he
was
so
sad
and
did
not
speak
to
anyone
frey
answered
that
he
had
seen
a
beautiful
woman
and
for
her
sake
he
was
full
of
grief
now
thou
shalt
go
he
said
and
ask
her
in
marriage
for
me
and
bring
her
home
hither
whether
her
father
be
willing
or
not
i
will
reward
thee
well
for
the
skirnir
replied
that
he
would
go
and
deliver
this
message
if
frey
gave
him
his
sword
this
sword
was
so
powerful
that
it
fought
of
itself
frey
gave
it
to
him
and
then
skirnir
departed
and
asked
the
woman
of
gymir
in
marriage
for
frey
and
gerd
promised
him
that
she
would
come
after
three
nights
and
keep
her
wedding
with
frey
when
skirnir
had
told
frey
of
the
result
of
his
journey
frey
sang
long
is
one
night
long
is
another
how
can
i
endure
three
often
a
month
to
me
seemed
shorter
than
this
forthcoming
wedding
hjorvard
having
thus
told
the
story
of
frey
said
ivar
my
son
when
i
look
from
dampstadir
over
the
sea
i
see
yonder
towards
the
west
where
we
often
behold
so
many
grand
sunsets
a
beautiful
maiden
nay
three
beautiful
ones
walking
in
the
green
paths
leading
to
upsalir
these
three
maidens
are
the
daughters
of
yngvi
the
hersir
of
svithjod
and
as
thou
knowest
their
beauty
and
accomplishments
are
known
all
over
our
northern
lands
thou
hast
come
to
that
age
when
it
is
time
for
thee
to
find
a
wife
and
i
have
thought
of
a
match
for
thee
kinsman
if
thou
wilt
follow
my
advice
and
nothing
would
please
me
more
than
to
have
thee
marry
one
of
yngvi
s
daughters
thou
mightest
visit
many
countries
and
find
no
maidens
more
accomplished
than
they
are
and
it
would
be
of
good
advantage
to
our
family
and
to
gotland
if
thou
didst
marry
one
of
them
and
bring
our
kinship
still
closer
than
it
was
before
with
the
hersir
of
ivar
replied
that
he
knew
how
much
his
father
had
his
welfare
at
heart
but
said
thou
must
not
forget
father
that
the
daughters
of
yngvi
have
the
highest
pedigree
in
all
the
northern
lands
and
the
realm
of
gotland
may
not
be
large
enough
for
their
ambition
it
may
be
possible
that
these
daughters
may
wish
to
wed
men
having
greater
possessions
than
myself
i
think
it
would
be
prudent
before
thou
and
our
kinsmen
propose
the
match
that
i
obtain
greater
renown
than
i
there
is
no
difficulty
my
son
about
thy
pedigree
for
we
are
all
of
odin
s
kin
and
you
would
be
equally
the
conversation
ended
there
for
the
present
ivar
leaving
the
matter
of
his
marriage
in
his
father
s
hands
though
he
thought
much
of
what
hjorvard
had
said
and
of
his
earnest
wish
to
have
him
happily
and
honorably
married
he
knew
too
that
yngvi
and
hjorvard
were
great
friends
and
visited
one
another
and
gave
feasts
to
each
other
and
that
a
connection
by
marriage
between
the
two
families
would
be
very
advantageous
and
agreeable
to
his
parents
chapter
xiv
haki
s
burning
journey
to
valhalla
on
their
return
from
the
caspian
the
four
had
found
the
country
very
much
disturbed
several
vikings
from
abroad
with
a
great
number
of
ships
had
been
plundering
here
and
there
among
the
people
peace
had
deserted
the
land
and
great
distress
from
these
incursions
prevailed
everywhere
among
the
greatest
plunderers
were
two
famous
brothers
of
the
name
of
haki
and
hagbard
they
were
great
vikings
and
had
a
large
host
and
a
great
number
of
powerful
and
swift
ships
these
had
gray
sails
and
were
painted
of
such
a
color
that
their
vessels
could
not
be
seen
far
away
haki
and
hagbard
had
no
lands
they
lived
on
their
ships
and
never
slept
under
a
roof
nor
did
they
ever
drink
at
the
their
men
had
no
homes
and
had
left
their
country
preferring
a
life
of
adventure
and
warfare
with
two
such
famous
chiefs
they
attacked
people
ashore
everywhere
and
plundered
them
and
afterwards
returned
with
their
booty
to
their
ships
they
wintered
in
the
rivers
and
defied
the
power
of
rome
and
of
all
the
hersirs
in
the
land
when
their
ships
were
old
they
bought
new
ones
or
captured
others
they
had
at
last
become
tired
of
western
countries
had
returned
to
the
norseland
and
had
been
outlawed
by
all
the
things
or
assemblies
of
the
people
of
every
realm
haki
had
with
him
twelve
champions
among
whom
were
starkad
the
old
and
ulf
the
valiant
all
his
men
were
berserks
who
were
often
seized
by
the
berserk
fury
starkad
and
ulf
were
old
men
who
had
been
through
many
a
bloody
fight
and
had
served
under
haki
s
father
who
had
never
himself
slept
under
a
roof
they
all
had
taken
an
oath
at
a
great
sacrifice
that
they
would
never
die
in
a
bed
neither
would
they
ever
throw
themselves
from
a
rock
in
order
to
go
to
odin
and
valhalla
but
that
they
would
all
die
by
weapons
in
battle
haki
himself
was
one
of
the
greatest
of
champions
and
so
agile
as
well
as
powerful
that
he
was
a
most
dangerous
enemy
to
deal
with
one
day
haki
went
with
his
host
against
thorkel
a
great
hersir
without
warning
for
he
ruthlessly
disregarded
the
laws
of
war
so
that
thorkel
had
hardly
time
to
collect
his
warriors
the
latter
had
also
twelve
champions
among
whom
were
the
brothers
svidpad
and
geigad
both
in
the
north
a
fierce
battle
took
place
and
valhalla
was
destined
to
receive
many
men
that
day
when
the
battle
was
at
its
height
svidpad
and
geigad
made
a
furious
assault
on
haki
s
men
and
many
of
them
never
saw
the
light
again
all
of
haki
s
champions
were
badly
wounded
and
could
fight
no
more
being
too
weak
on
account
of
loss
of
blood
then
he
went
forward
and
broke
the
of
thorkel
and
slew
him
as
well
as
his
and
also
svidpad
and
geigad
he
conquered
the
land
and
took
possession
of
it
and
became
the
ruler
of
the
herad
of
thorkel
he
stayed
at
home
during
the
winter
and
ruled
the
land
he
had
conquered
after
which
his
champions
sailed
away
to
southern
lands
on
viking
expeditions
and
earned
much
wealth
for
themselves
among
other
great
vikings
who
never
slept
under
a
roof
or
drank
by
the
and
who
disturbed
the
land
and
had
been
outlawed
were
the
brothers
eirick
and
jorund
after
a
great
battle
in
which
they
had
slain
the
hersir
of
gautaland
they
thought
themselves
far
greater
men
than
before
and
wished
to
try
their
strength
against
haki
and
hagbard
and
avenge
the
disgrace
put
upon
thorkel
their
kinsman
so
when
they
heard
that
haki
had
allowed
his
champions
to
go
away
they
collected
a
large
host
when
it
was
known
that
they
had
come
to
reconquer
the
land
for
their
kinsmen
the
people
from
all
the
country
round
flocked
to
their
standards
in
large
numbers
and
a
great
host
marched
against
haki
a
mighty
battle
soon
took
place
for
a
long
time
victory
was
undecided
champion
fighting
against
champion
finally
haki
rushed
forward
and
fought
with
such
irresistible
force
that
he
slew
all
near
him
among
them
eirick
and
cut
down
the
of
the
brothers
whereupon
jorund
fled
to
his
ships
with
his
men
but
haki
had
received
such
severe
wounds
that
he
foresaw
that
his
remaining
days
would
be
few
he
had
made
ready
a
vessel
which
he
prized
very
highly
on
account
of
its
swiftness
beauty
and
war
power
he
had
it
loaded
with
the
bodies
of
warriors
that
had
fallen
in
battle
together
with
their
weapons
and
had
a
large
pyre
of
tarred
wood
made
on
the
ship
then
he
bade
his
followers
farewell
and
told
them
that
he
was
going
to
odin
and
ordered
men
to
carry
him
in
full
war
dress
with
helmet
sword
and
shield
on
board
of
his
ship
then
he
bade
them
to
build
a
large
pyre
near
the
prow
and
to
lay
him
upon
it
after
they
had
done
so
he
had
the
rudder
adjusted
and
the
sail
hoisted
and
set
and
much
gold
and
many
weapons
placed
on
board
then
the
tarred
wood
was
kindled
the
wind
blew
from
the
shore
seaward
the
burning
ship
sailed
away
and
the
warriors
bade
haki
and
his
men
a
happy
journey
to
valhalla
farther
and
farther
the
funeral
pyre
of
haki
and
his
men
went
on
its
way
the
flames
rose
higher
and
higher
towards
the
sky
the
sail
burned
and
at
last
the
mast
looking
like
a
tower
of
fire
fell
upon
the
deck
the
people
believed
that
the
higher
the
flames
rose
the
greater
would
be
the
welcome
in
valhalla
then
the
lurid
glare
of
the
flames
became
less
and
less
brilliant
and
on
a
sudden
the
ship
went
down
into
the
deep
but
haki
and
his
warriors
had
sailed
to
valhalla
and
the
people
said
that
this
great
deed
of
haki
would
live
forever
in
the
memory
of
man
and
would
be
sung
by
the
scalds
to
the
end
of
time
during
this
time
ivar
and
his
had
gathered
a
large
host
and
made
his
vessels
ready
for
he
intended
to
make
war
on
the
viking
raiders
who
infested
the
sea
and
brought
trouble
and
insecurity
upon
the
land
as
they
were
being
launched
hjalmar
s
ship
struck
one
man
as
it
came
down
the
rollers
and
killed
him
this
accident
happened
once
in
a
great
while
at
the
launching
of
operation
that
was
always
attended
with
danger
the
more
so
if
it
were
not
carefully
done
such
an
accident
was
called
and
was
considered
a
very
bad
omen
therefore
the
intended
expedition
was
abandoned
ivar
and
his
thought
that
some
faithless
family
spirits
wished
them
evil
and
had
abandoned
their
watch
over
them
the
next
day
when
ivar
and
hjalmar
were
walking
together
ivar
thought
he
saw
a
pet
goat
of
his
which
had
been
always
in
the
habit
of
coming
into
the
courtyard
no
one
was
allowed
to
drive
him
away
suddenly
he
said
this
is
strange
what
dost
thou
see
that
seems
strange
to
thee
asked
hjalmar
it
seems
to
me
ivar
answered
that
the
goat
which
lies
in
this
hollow
place
is
covered
with
hjalmar
astonished
answered
him
that
there
was
no
goat
there
nor
anything
else
what
is
it
then
inquired
ivar
i
am
afraid
hjalmar
returned
that
thou
must
be
a
man
and
that
thou
hast
seen
the
spirit
that
follows
and
protects
thee
warning
thee
of
danger
and
if
not
thyself
some
of
thy
kinsmen
may
perhaps
be
fated
to
die
guard
thyself
well
i
will
also
watch
carefully
over
thee
so
will
sigurd
and
that
will
not
serve
cried
ivar
if
death
is
fated
to
me
for
no
man
can
change
his
fate
but
i
will
fall
these
two
successive
omens
made
a
deep
impression
upon
ivar
the
ships
were
dragged
ashore
and
put
under
the
sheds
and
it
was
announced
that
no
expeditions
were
to
take
place
that
year
then
ivar
made
a
special
sacrifice
to
frey
for
he
loved
frey
more
than
all
the
other
gods
and
often
sacrificed
to
him
and
that
day
he
offered
up
four
black
oxen
and
two
of
his
most
valuable
horses
the
following
day
hjalmar
said
to
ivar
let
us
find
out
the
decrees
that
fate
has
in
store
for
us
for
i
do
not
like
the
that
has
taken
place
at
the
launching
of
our
ships
or
the
vision
of
the
bloody
goat
let
us
consult
the
oracles
as
well
as
sacrifice
to
frey
i
still
fear
some
impending
misfortune
is
going
to
happen
to
some
of
us
and
that
some
great
sorrow
will
overtake
us
let
us
make
ready
and
beware
of
treachery
perhaps
we
may
meet
a
witch
full
of
evil
on
the
way
then
it
is
better
to
walk
on
than
to
lodge
in
her
house
though
the
night
may
be
stormy
often
wicked
women
sit
near
the
road
who
blunt
both
swords
and
sense
let
us
never
go
out
of
doors
without
our
weapons
for
it
is
hard
to
know
when
out
on
the
roads
if
a
man
may
need
his
spear
the
sons
of
men
need
eyes
of
they
made
therefore
another
sacrifice
and
dipped
the
sacrificial
chips
into
the
blood
of
the
sacrificed
animal
that
was
kept
in
the
sacred
copper
bowl
which
stood
on
the
altar
of
the
temple
the
sacrificing
chips
were
thrown
into
the
air
and
the
answer
was
that
ivar
would
not
die
but
must
remain
at
home
that
year
and
that
a
kinsman
very
dear
to
him
would
be
killed
in
battle
so
ivar
stayed
quietly
at
home
the
following
summer
ivar
made
the
elidi
ready
and
sailed
for
norway
but
on
the
voyage
while
in
the
cattegat
he
was
obliged
to
stay
on
an
island
on
account
of
head
winds
there
they
threw
the
sacrificial
chips
again
to
get
fair
winds
and
as
they
fell
they
indicated
that
odin
was
to
receive
one
man
out
of
their
host
before
a
fair
wind
would
come
they
then
sailed
toward
the
coast
and
cast
anchor
and
there
they
landed
not
far
from
their
place
of
landing
was
a
great
sacrificing
ring
in
the
midst
of
which
lay
a
huge
stone
or
altar
the
people
were
in
the
habit
of
coming
there
from
the
surrounding
country
to
make
human
sacrifice
and
to
break
the
backs
of
men
given
to
odin
on
that
altar
agnar
was
the
name
of
the
man
whom
the
oracles
speaking
through
the
sacrificial
chips
had
designated
and
upon
the
altar
his
back
was
broken
and
he
was
given
to
odin
and
they
reddened
the
altar
with
his
blood
after
this
the
men
returned
to
their
ships
and
sailed
away
with
a
fair
wind
this
sacrificing
ring
where
agnar
was
given
to
odin
is
seen
to
this
day
near
blomholm
in
the
province
of
bohuslan
where
a
large
ring
composed
of
eleven
stones
is
still
standing
with
a
sacrificial
boulder
in
the
centre
chapter
xv
death
and
burning
of
hjorvard
the
warning
of
so
many
bad
omens
proved
to
be
true
during
a
terrific
in
which
many
ships
were
engaged
between
hjorvard
and
starkad
a
powerful
hersir
with
whom
he
had
long
had
a
feud
on
account
of
a
disputed
inheritance
hjorvard
received
his
during
this
fierce
conflict
weapons
buried
themselves
in
bloody
wounds
and
sank
deep
into
men
s
bodies
rivers
of
blood
gushed
out
on
the
armor
the
whirlwinds
of
the
valkyrias
as
the
poetical
norsemen
called
battles
were
abroad
among
men
arrows
and
spears
played
round
the
shields
in
the
midst
of
the
tempest
of
many
swords
were
broken
many
shields
were
rent
asunder
many
suits
of
were
cut
to
pieces
and
many
of
the
host
took
their
journey
to
valhalla
suddenly
hjorvard
thought
he
saw
during
the
battle
a
valkyria
the
mighty
skogul
leaning
on
her
and
heard
her
say
now
the
elect
of
odin
are
coming
a
great
host
will
enter
valhalla
before
then
looking
up
he
thought
he
saw
valkyrias
on
horseback
in
front
of
skogul
and
gondul
bearing
themselves
nobly
helmeted
with
shields
with
their
hair
floating
in
the
air
behind
their
backs
and
with
spears
from
which
rays
of
light
sprung
then
hjorvard
exclaimed
gondul
and
skogul
odin
has
sent
to
choose
among
chiefs
who
of
the
ynglingar
kin
should
to
him
go
and
in
valhalla
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
valkyrias
hovered
over
him
he
was
then
clad
with
helmet
and
and
standing
under
his
war
standard
the
oars
had
dropped
the
battle
was
then
raging
most
fiercely
the
spears
hissed
the
arrows
quivered
flames
of
fire
came
from
the
swords
hjorvard
urged
the
gotlanders
and
his
champions
to
the
fight
the
play
of
the
valkyrias
was
waxing
hotter
and
hotter
hjorvard
s
sword
cut
into
the
cloth
of
odin
for
such
was
the
name
which
norsemen
gave
to
as
if
it
were
water
and
reddened
the
ships
with
the
blood
of
men
suddenly
hjorvard
beheld
as
in
a
vision
skuld
the
norn
at
the
head
of
the
valkyrias
and
about
to
sever
the
thread
of
his
own
life
he
was
right
odin
guided
a
spear
towards
him
and
hjorvard
received
his
the
following
morning
he
lay
on
the
deck
of
his
ship
amidst
many
dead
champions
in
his
delirium
he
murmured
why
hast
thou
decided
the
battle
as
thou
didst
mighty
skogul
we
surely
deserved
victory
from
the
and
skogul
seemed
to
answer
we
have
caused
thee
to
keep
the
field
and
thy
foes
to
flee
we
shall
now
ride
to
valhalla
to
tell
odin
that
hjorvard
the
and
his
fallen
host
are
coming
and
in
his
dying
ears
seemed
to
sound
the
voice
of
odin
saying
hermod
and
bragi
go
forth
to
meet
hjorvard
the
valiant
hersir
of
gotland
for
he
is
coming
this
way
to
the
hall
he
is
bespattered
with
blood
and
has
a
mighty
host
following
and
as
he
dreamed
of
entering
the
portals
of
valhalla
he
heard
again
the
voice
of
odin
saying
welcome
hjorvard
thou
shalt
have
peace
with
the
chosen
and
cheer
from
the
asars
thou
fighter
of
men
and
wise
ruler
who
didst
take
care
of
the
sacrifices
and
temples
thou
hast
more
than
many
a
chief
in
many
a
land
reddened
the
sword
and
carried
forward
the
bloody
blade
twice
welcome
hjorvard
my
maids
the
valkyrias
will
carry
wine
to
thee
and
wait
upon
thee
and
carry
ale
to
those
who
have
come
with
hjorvard
awoke
partially
however
from
his
dying
swoon
and
lived
long
enough
to
be
brought
home
in
his
ship
and
before
expiring
he
said
to
sigrlin
wife
let
my
burning
journey
be
worthy
of
our
kinsmen
let
a
wide
and
high
mound
be
raised
over
me
let
the
mortuary
chamber
be
roomy
surround
the
mound
with
tents
shields
weapons
of
all
kinds
for
it
is
good
to
have
them
for
fight
in
valhalla
let
foreign
linen
silk
and
costly
garments
and
riding
gear
go
with
me
place
me
on
the
pyre
in
full
war
dress
clad
with
my
gold
helmet
my
costliest
and
gird
me
with
one
of
my
best
swords
let
many
horses
be
killed
and
follow
me
also
my
hawks
so
that
i
may
enter
valhalla
as
it
befits
a
great
chief
and
a
ynglingar
and
throw
gold
and
silver
on
the
pyre
and
throw
also
many
weapons
so
that
the
shining
golden
doors
of
valhalla
be
not
shut
against
me
and
my
warriors
that
have
fallen
thus
our
journey
will
not
be
poor
for
the
wealth
that
we
have
earned
during
our
life
and
not
given
away
will
go
with
us
place
by
me
also
the
sharp
sword
that
lay
between
thee
and
me
before
we
were
wedded
while
i
courted
thee
for
thy
person
was
holy
and
that
sword
defended
thee
and
guarded
thy
he
had
hardly
uttered
these
words
when
he
expired
and
according
to
holy
custom
his
eyes
and
mouth
were
closed
and
his
nostrils
pinched
his
body
and
head
carefully
washed
and
his
hair
combed
the
people
said
that
odin
himself
had
steered
the
ship
of
hjorvard
during
the
battle
ivar
was
not
in
the
fleet
when
the
fight
which
caused
his
father
s
death
took
place
nor
was
he
at
home
but
two
days
after
his
father
s
demise
he
returned
to
dampstadir
he
had
left
his
ships
on
the
other
side
of
the
island
on
account
of
contrary
winds
and
crossed
the
country
on
horseback
on
his
arrival
he
went
immediately
to
the
great
hall
as
it
was
his
custom
when
he
returned
from
an
expedition
to
drink
with
his
men
he
little
dreamed
then
of
the
sad
news
that
awaited
him
for
no
one
on
the
way
had
been
willing
to
tell
him
of
his
father
s
death
he
had
hardly
seated
himself
on
the
high
seat
opposite
to
that
of
his
father
when
his
eye
caught
sight
of
what
he
had
not
noticed
at
first
on
his
entrance
he
saw
the
walls
covered
with
black
and
gray
hangings
this
had
been
done
by
his
mother
for
it
was
the
custom
upon
occasions
of
this
kind
and
importance
to
drape
the
great
hall
in
mourning
and
the
hangings
told
of
the
great
sorrow
and
loss
which
gotland
had
sustained
by
this
ivar
then
knew
that
the
death
of
a
great
kinsman
had
taken
place
and
his
face
at
once
betrayed
an
expression
of
profound
anxiety
shortly
afterwards
his
mother
came
in
and
seated
herself
by
his
side
ivar
looked
intently
at
her
and
after
noticing
the
pallor
of
her
face
said
to
her
thou
must
have
ordered
mother
the
hall
to
be
thus
draped
tell
me
for
what
purpose
and
for
whom
are
those
tokens
of
mourning
sigrlin
answered
my
husband
the
hersir
of
gotland
is
no
more
hjorvard
thy
father
is
dead
but
fell
gloriously
in
the
midst
of
the
tokens
that
forebode
the
death
of
a
kinsman
have
then
proved
true
said
ivar
with
a
deep
sigh
the
sacrificial
chips
foretold
then
he
added
sorrowfully
and
with
a
voice
full
of
emotion
a
man
can
not
be
saved
all
is
dangerous
to
the
a
man
who
is
not
can
not
receive
his
he
will
escape
in
some
way
or
other
but
every
one
must
die
the
day
he
is
the
decrees
which
the
nornir
made
the
day
of
my
father
s
birth
had
to
be
sigrlin
was
inconsolable
at
the
death
of
her
husband
but
she
did
not
weep
nor
wring
her
hands
nor
wail
as
women
often
do
very
wise
men
came
forward
who
tried
to
console
her
heavy
heart
but
they
did
not
succeed
for
though
unable
to
weep
her
sorrow
was
great
and
her
heart
broken
the
brides
of
powerful
chiefs
and
warriors
sat
by
her
side
trying
to
soothe
her
sorrow
each
of
them
related
her
woes
the
bitterest
sorrow
she
had
suffered
the
sister
of
gjuki
said
no
woman
on
earth
lacks
love
more
than
i
have
suffered
the
loss
of
two
husbands
of
three
daughters
of
eight
brothers
and
of
four
sisters
and
yet
i
still
sigrlin
could
not
weep
then
said
herborg
i
have
a
harder
sorrow
to
tell
my
seven
sons
and
my
husband
fell
among
the
slain
in
the
southern
lands
the
brother
of
ægir
the
wind
and
the
nine
daughters
of
ran
played
with
my
father
and
mother
and
with
my
four
brothers
on
the
deep
they
were
dashed
against
the
gunwale
of
their
ship
and
they
were
killed
i
myself
had
to
wash
to
dress
to
handle
and
to
bury
their
bodies
all
that
i
suffered
in
a
single
year
and
no
man
gave
me
help
the
same
year
i
became
a
i
had
to
dress
and
to
tie
the
shoes
of
a
hersir
s
wife
every
morning
she
threatened
me
because
of
jealousy
and
struck
me
with
hard
blows
nowhere
found
i
a
better
housemaster
nor
anywhere
a
worse
still
sigrlin
could
not
weep
then
gullrond
spoke
thus
to
them
little
comfort
can
you
give
by
speaking
as
you
have
done
to
sigrlin
wise
though
you
thereupon
she
bade
them
uncover
the
body
of
hjorvard
when
she
drew
the
sheet
from
it
and
threw
it
on
the
ground
at
the
feet
of
sigrlin
saying
to
her
look
on
thy
beloved
husband
put
thy
mouth
to
his
now
silent
lips
as
thou
wert
wont
when
thou
didst
embrace
sigrlin
looked
at
her
dead
husband
and
she
saw
the
wound
on
his
breast
the
lips
that
could
not
speak
the
ears
that
could
not
hear
the
eyes
that
could
not
see
and
the
hands
that
could
not
caress
the
cheeks
were
pale
and
the
mind
and
life
had
gone
at
the
sight
she
sank
down
upon
the
pillow
where
the
dead
hjorvard
s
head
rested
flushed
were
her
cheeks
and
a
tear
fell
upon
her
tresses
then
upon
her
knees
and
from
those
springs
called
the
eyes
rivers
of
sorrow
flowed
copiously
and
she
was
comforted
five
days
after
the
death
of
hjorvard
his
funeral
or
his
burning
journey
to
valhalla
took
place
for
it
was
the
law
of
the
land
that
men
should
be
laid
under
mound
not
later
than
the
fifth
day
after
their
demise
the
people
believed
that
odin
had
enacted
the
same
laws
in
the
northern
lands
as
formerly
prevailed
among
the
asar
thus
he
ordered
that
all
dead
men
should
be
burned
and
that
on
the
pyre
should
be
placed
their
property
promising
that
with
the
same
amount
of
wealth
should
they
come
to
valhalla
as
was
burned
with
them
also
that
they
should
enjoy
what
they
themselves
buried
in
the
ground
and
that
their
ashes
should
be
thrown
into
the
sea
or
buried
in
the
earth
that
over
great
men
mounds
should
be
raised
as
memorials
and
over
men
that
had
especially
distinguished
themselves
for
manliness
memorial
stones
should
be
erected
it
had
been
agreed
by
ivar
and
his
kinsmen
that
hjorvard
s
burning
journey
should
be
on
board
a
ship
and
that
the
ship
should
not
be
sent
to
sea
but
burned
ashore
a
fine
skuta
of
fifteen
benches
beautifully
ornamented
was
chosen
for
the
pyre
their
powerful
war
ships
never
being
used
on
such
occasions
the
skuta
was
propped
to
stand
up
as
if
it
were
in
the
water
the
prow
looked
towards
the
sea
as
if
ready
to
be
launched
for
an
expedition
a
large
quantity
of
tarred
wood
surrounded
it
and
in
the
prow
of
the
ship
the
resting
place
of
hjorvard
had
been
erected
when
all
the
preparations
were
ready
hjorvard
s
body
was
carried
upon
the
bed
on
which
he
lay
he
was
dressed
in
full
war
costume
clad
with
helmet
and
with
sword
by
his
right
side
and
shield
on
his
breast
spears
were
laid
by
his
left
hand
and
at
his
feet
lay
his
golden
spurs
ivar
then
brought
forward
his
own
magnificently
harnessed
and
equipped
then
followed
a
superb
and
profusely
decorated
carriage
with
a
single
seat
standing
high
in
the
middle
and
twelve
horses
the
horses
and
falcons
were
slaughtered
and
the
carriage
broken
and
thrown
upon
the
pyre
then
ivar
just
as
the
torch
was
applied
bade
hjorvard
his
kinsman
to
sail
ride
or
drive
to
valhalla
as
he
liked
best
and
all
his
champions
warriors
and
multitudes
of
people
bade
him
a
happy
journey
and
expressed
the
hope
that
he
would
welcome
them
there
at
the
proper
time
when
the
decrees
of
the
nornir
should
be
fulfilled
in
regard
to
them
so
that
his
journey
to
valhalla
might
be
worthy
of
him
they
threw
into
the
pyre
many
costly
things
weapons
and
quantities
of
gold
and
silver
the
loose
property
which
hjorvard
had
won
or
got
during
his
life
and
that
had
remained
in
his
possession
was
also
thrown
into
the
funeral
pile
all
the
weapons
that
were
to
follow
him
to
valhalla
were
according
to
ancient
customs
rendered
useless
swords
and
were
bent
and
their
edges
indented
shafts
were
broken
shields
were
rent
asunder
and
cut
roman
and
greek
objects
were
partly
destroyed
and
with
roman
coins
were
also
thrown
into
the
ship
solemn
and
grand
was
the
spectacle
and
lurid
the
glare
gradually
the
flames
became
less
and
less
high
the
noise
of
the
cracking
wood
became
fainter
and
fainter
and
finally
nothing
was
seen
but
the
burning
embers
then
the
charred
bones
of
hjorvard
were
gathered
in
the
midst
of
solemn
silence
the
ashes
were
scattered
to
the
wind
and
fell
into
the
sea
the
burned
bones
were
put
in
a
beautiful
roman
bronze
vessel
and
with
them
roman
coins
of
diocletian
s
time
the
that
had
caused
his
also
a
few
draughtsmen
belonging
to
his
and
two
dice
twelve
with
their
convex
side
downward
were
made
a
lid
for
the
vase
and
lay
over
the
bones
a
bent
sword
was
placed
over
the
cinerary
urn
which
was
put
in
the
mortuary
chamber
that
had
been
prepared
and
a
large
cairn
which
took
several
days
to
build
was
raised
over
hjorvard
s
remains
and
a
large
memorial
stone
with
runic
inscription
put
on
the
top
thus
went
to
valhalla
hjorvard
the
hersir
of
gotland
it
is
wise
said
ivar
to
his
hjalmar
as
they
were
mournfully
conversing
upon
the
sad
ceremonies
of
the
past
few
days
that
odin
has
ordered
that
the
wealth
of
a
man
his
gold
and
silver
and
his
movable
property
should
go
on
his
burning
journey
with
him
this
thought
makes
him
generous
during
his
life
and
he
gives
away
lavishly
the
wealth
that
he
acquires
thus
preventing
his
heart
from
being
hardened
towards
those
who
are
in
need
so
hersirs
and
prominent
men
should
not
be
miserly
the
wealth
that
is
thus
given
during
one
s
life
is
given
back
to
them
in
then
after
a
pause
he
added
musingly
i
have
often
thought
of
helgi
my
first
cousin
the
son
of
halfdan
and
that
if
he
had
lived
he
would
have
been
the
hersir
of
gotland
instead
of
my
father
then
i
should
not
now
be
ruler
over
the
sacrifices
how
strange
are
the
decrees
of
the
nornir
chapter
xvi
helgi
and
the
valkyrias
ivar
had
spoken
of
helgi
because
he
had
often
heard
his
father
mention
his
brother
but
he
has
not
been
referred
to
in
this
narrative
before
for
he
had
been
dead
many
years
halfdan
had
married
thurid
a
beautiful
daughter
of
the
hersir
of
zeeland
and
loved
her
passionately
she
died
about
a
year
after
their
marriage
in
giving
birth
to
a
son
halfdan
was
so
grieved
at
the
death
of
his
wife
that
he
ordered
the
child
who
was
the
cause
of
such
great
misfortune
to
him
to
be
exposed
the
infant
was
laid
in
a
cradle
and
a
piece
of
pork
was
put
in
his
mouth
the
cradle
was
taken
to
a
wood
at
some
distance
from
dampstadir
and
put
near
the
root
of
a
tree
in
such
a
manner
that
the
infant
should
be
protected
against
the
wind
and
the
bad
weather
and
thus
die
easily
no
name
had
been
fastened
upon
him
as
water
had
not
been
poured
upon
him
a
short
time
after
the
child
had
been
exposed
an
uncle
of
hjorvard
was
passing
through
the
forest
he
heard
the
cries
of
the
little
one
and
following
the
direction
of
the
noise
he
was
profoundly
touched
at
the
sight
and
took
compassion
upon
the
babe
and
brought
him
up
secretly
on
his
estate
his
sister
taking
great
care
of
him
and
both
loving
him
tenderly
halfdan
never
married
again
for
his
love
for
thurid
was
far
too
great
and
in
his
eyes
no
woman
could
equal
her
his
memory
and
love
for
her
never
faded
from
his
mind
to
his
death
and
the
last
word
he
uttered
was
her
name
as
the
child
grew
older
he
became
a
very
handsome
boy
but
he
had
not
the
power
of
talking
and
his
uncle
mourned
that
the
nornir
had
fated
him
to
be
dumb
and
began
to
think
that
perhaps
it
would
have
been
better
to
have
left
him
exposed
but
one
day
as
the
boy
was
seated
on
a
mound
he
saw
afar
off
gleams
of
light
flashing
in
the
sky
coming
toward
him
and
imagined
that
he
beheld
nine
valkyrias
riding
in
the
air
over
the
sea
clad
with
helmet
and
and
with
glittering
spears
in
their
hands
one
of
them
was
the
foremost
and
as
she
rode
above
him
she
fastened
a
name
upon
him
and
sang
helgi
shall
thy
name
be
thou
wilt
rule
over
great
wealth
on
the
plains
of
rodalsvellir
in
immediately
helgi
began
to
speak
after
helgi
had
grown
up
he
went
on
warlike
expeditions
in
foreign
lands
and
never
returned
to
his
birthplace
and
to
his
kinsmen
but
no
one
wondered
at
this
for
in
those
days
warriors
often
conquered
realms
and
settled
there
and
never
came
back
or
else
perished
and
no
tidings
of
them
reached
home
after
the
death
of
helgi
s
father
men
were
sent
into
every
land
in
search
of
helgi
to
tell
him
to
come
and
get
his
inheritance
but
no
tidings
were
heard
from
him
and
hjorvard
took
the
rule
over
gotland
after
the
inheritance
feast
of
halfdan
his
brother
had
taken
place
as
time
went
on
and
years
passed
away
great
tidings
were
told
of
helgi
in
the
norseland
and
his
life
began
to
be
sung
by
the
scalds
the
people
said
and
believed
that
the
valkyria
that
had
given
him
his
name
was
called
bodvild
and
that
skuld
had
given
him
the
power
of
speech
as
the
nornir
had
only
fated
him
to
be
speechless
during
part
of
his
boyhood
that
bodvild
was
the
daughter
of
a
hersir
called
hogni
who
ruled
over
a
large
realm
in
southern
lands
not
far
from
the
black
sea
and
that
bodvild
at
times
was
a
valkyria
and
when
tired
of
that
life
came
among
men
and
became
as
other
women
then
again
she
would
disappear
and
be
a
valkyria
they
believed
that
bodvild
was
svafa
svafa
had
been
the
daughter
of
one
of
the
great
rulers
of
the
north
in
ancient
times
and
led
the
life
bodvild
was
supposed
to
lead
it
was
the
belief
among
the
people
that
sometimes
the
thinking
mind
of
a
person
came
again
to
dwell
among
men
and
women
that
it
was
only
the
body
that
was
unlike
the
story
told
of
helgi
that
had
come
to
gotland
was
as
follows
orvar
was
a
powerful
ruler
who
lived
at
svaringshaug
he
had
many
sons
among
them
were
gunnar
gudmund
starkad
and
hogni
hodbrod
had
gone
to
an
appointed
meeting
of
hersirs
and
there
he
betrothed
himself
to
bodvild
with
the
consent
of
hogni
her
father
but
without
her
knowledge
for
she
was
not
at
home
it
often
happened
that
fathers
betrothed
their
daughters
without
their
consent
and
knowledge
when
these
owned
no
entailed
lands
in
their
own
rights
when
bodvild
heard
that
she
had
been
betrothed
by
her
father
without
her
consent
she
grieved
deeply
for
she
loved
helgi
and
had
made
her
mind
to
marry
him
then
she
went
with
valkyrias
for
she
had
taken
their
shape
and
rode
over
land
and
sea
in
search
of
helgi
to
tell
him
the
sad
tidings
of
her
fate
one
day
bodvild
saw
helgi
he
was
then
at
the
loga
mountains
and
there
had
fought
against
the
sons
of
hunding
a
powerful
hersir
who
ruled
over
a
large
realm
in
that
battle
he
slew
alf
eyjolf
and
hervard
he
was
very
weary
of
the
fight
and
sat
down
at
a
place
called
eaglestone
when
bodvild
came
to
him
she
threw
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
kissed
him
and
told
him
of
her
errand
helgi
was
under
helmet
and
was
then
naturally
thinking
of
war
for
he
had
many
foes
but
his
thoughts
turned
towards
the
fair
maiden
who
was
by
his
side
she
said
that
she
loved
him
with
all
her
mind
for
she
had
heard
of
his
great
deeds
and
told
him
how
she
had
been
betrothed
to
hodbrod
by
her
father
but
another
chief
i
wanted
to
have
and
that
chief
is
thyself
i
fear
the
anger
of
my
kinsmen
for
i
have
broken
the
marriage
which
my
father
had
made
his
mind
for
me
to
have
but
hogni
s
daughter
wants
the
love
of
helgi
and
of
no
one
helgi
answered
do
not
care
for
the
wrath
of
thy
father
nor
the
ill
will
of
thy
kinsmen
thou
wilt
young
maiden
live
with
me
thy
kinsmen
i
do
not
fear
i
will
marry
then
she
betrothed
herself
to
helgi
and
on
that
account
war
was
declared
by
hogni
her
father
and
by
all
her
kinsmen
against
helgi
hodbrod
who
was
a
widower
joined
them
with
his
sons
helgi
gathered
a
large
fleet
and
sailed
towards
frekastein
the
place
appointed
for
the
battle
they
had
hardly
lost
sight
of
land
when
a
great
tempest
arose
it
thundered
lightning
darted
and
fell
among
the
ships
it
seemed
as
if
the
fleet
were
to
founder
in
the
midst
of
the
sea
for
the
ships
had
become
unmanageable
and
the
men
made
preparations
to
meet
ran
ægir
and
his
brother
the
wind
were
in
an
ugly
mood
the
daughters
of
ran
were
all
round
the
ships
and
showered
upon
them
blow
after
blow
when
lo
helgi
thought
he
saw
three
times
nine
valkyrias
riding
in
the
air
and
hovering
over
the
ships
and
said
to
his
men
behold
the
maidens
of
odin
how
beautiful
they
are
as
they
look
down
upon
us
from
their
magnificent
coursers
among
them
and
foremost
was
skuld
the
youngest
of
the
nornir
then
came
bodvild
with
her
long
hair
flowing
in
the
air
as
her
steed
speeded
along
suddenly
the
storm
abated
and
helgi
believed
that
bodvild
had
come
to
shelter
him
the
fleet
continued
its
course
and
sailed
along
the
shore
and
came
to
frekastein
in
the
background
rose
the
loga
mountains
gudmund
one
of
the
sons
of
orvar
and
a
whose
name
was
egil
had
been
watching
silently
the
ships
of
helgi
suddenly
gudmund
shouted
who
is
the
chief
that
steers
the
ship
that
has
a
battle
standard
hoisted
on
the
prow
those
in
the
van
seem
not
to
be
people
the
redness
of
war
is
thrown
upon
them
the
red
shield
stands
high
at
the
top
of
the
egil
the
answered
here
can
gudmund
know
helgi
the
hater
of
flight
standing
in
the
midst
of
the
fleet
he
holds
the
of
thy
kin
the
fjörsungs
heritage
which
he
has
taken
from
gudmund
rode
home
with
the
news
of
war
then
all
the
sons
of
orvar
gathered
together
a
host
many
great
chiefs
repaired
to
their
standards
there
was
hogni
the
father
of
bodvild
and
his
sons
bragi
and
dag
and
also
hodbrod
the
hostile
hosts
met
at
the
appointed
field
of
battle
that
had
been
hazelled
or
marked
out
with
stakes
a
great
battle
took
place
there
was
immense
din
of
weapons
clashing
of
swords
and
of
spears
many
helmets
were
rent
asunder
many
shields
were
broken
and
a
great
host
departed
for
valhalla
gleams
flashed
from
the
loga
mountains
and
valkyrias
riding
helmet
covered
and
mail
clad
hovered
over
the
their
was
and
from
their
spears
rays
of
light
sprang
it
was
getting
towards
the
end
of
the
day
when
from
her
horse
bodvild
the
daughter
of
hogni
hushed
the
clatter
of
shields
and
immediately
a
truce
took
place
helgi
invited
the
valkyrias
to
come
to
a
feast
that
night
with
him
his
chiefs
were
to
be
there
but
bodvild
said
i
think
we
have
other
work
to
do
than
to
drink
with
thee
we
have
to
carry
the
elect
to
valhalla
and
they
disappeared
the
next
day
the
battle
continued
and
helgi
was
victorious
in
that
battle
all
the
sons
of
orvar
fell
and
all
the
chiefs
except
dag
son
of
hogni
whose
life
was
spared
for
loth
was
helgi
to
destroy
the
life
of
the
brother
of
bodvild
bodvild
went
about
among
the
slain
and
found
hodbrod
near
death
s
door
and
when
she
saw
him
she
sang
bodvild
the
daughter
of
hogni
will
not
fall
into
thy
arms
hodbrod
and
will
never
be
betrothed
to
thee
or
marry
thee
gone

of

corpses
and
the

afterwards
she
met
helgi
mortally

might
over

this
morning

at
frekastein
hodbrod
hogni
and
all
the
sons
of
orvar
and
i
was
their
slayer
for
i
fought
one
after
the
other
but
in
my
turn
i
fear
i
have
not
long
to
and
in
truth
dag
met
helgi
at
fjorturland
the
next
day
and
thrust
his
spear
through
him
and
helgi
fell
there
dead
then
dag
rode
to
the
seva
mountains
and
told
bodvild
the
tidings
thus
loth
i
am
sister
to
tell
thee
for
very
unwilling
i
am
to
make
thee
weep
this
morning
fell
at
fjorturland
the
land
he
had
conquered
the
man
who
stood
with
his
foot
on
the
neck
of
many
chiefs
who
had
to
pay
him
bodvild
was
wild
with
grief
when
she
heard
the
sorrowful
news
then
beside
herself
with
passion
and
with
eyes
flashing
fire
she
cursed
dag
her
brother
and
cried
by
the
clear
water
of
the
river
leiptir
which
runs
by
fjorturland
and
in
the
sea
the
ship
shall
not
move
that
carries
thee
though
a
fair
wind
blow
the
horse
shall
not
run
which
is
to
run
with
thee
though
thou
hast
to
escape
from
thy
foes
the
sword
shall
not
bite
which
thou
drawest
except
when
it
sings
about
thy
own
head
if
thou
wert
an
outlaw
hiding
in
the
forest
and
hadst
not
food
unless
thou
tearedst
corpses
then
and
not
before
all
these
curses
be
fulfilled
will
the
death
of
helgi
be
to
which
dag
answered
mad
art
thou
sister
and
out
of
thy
mind
as
thou
invokest
curses
on
thy
brother
odin
alone
causes
all
strife
between
then
dag
offered
indemnity
or
weregild
to
his
temple
and
large
estates
half
of
his
lands
and
a
large
amount
of
gold
but
she
refused
to
be
indemnified
for
helgi
s
death
she
was
and
died
early
from
grief
for
her
lover
and
as
helgi
was
dead
the
rule
over
gotland
had
come
into
the
hands
of
hjorvard
chapter
xvii
the
inheritance
feast
of
hjorvard
after
the
death
of
his
father
ivar
did
not
become
the
hersir
of
gotland
before
the
thing
or
assembly
of
the
people
had
ratified
his
hersirship
for
though
it
was
hereditary
no
one
could
rule
without
the
consent
of
the
thingmen
who
could
when
occasion
became
necessary
deprive
a
man
of
his
dignity
and
of
his
hersirship
for
the
hersir
had
to
obey
the
laws
as
well
as
the
humblest
man
of
the
land
and
the
greatest
power
of
the
land
was
the
thing
before
assuming
the
dignity
of
hersir
and
consequently
that
of
high
priest
of
gotland
ivar
made
a
sacrifice
before
the
people
and
according
to
ancient
custom
he
killed
a
ram
reddening
his
hands
in
its
blood
and
then
declared
the
godship
of
hjorvard
to
be
his
after
this
ceremony
he
was
to
rule
over
the
sacrifices
at
dampstadir
he
remained
at
home
waiting
till
the
arvel
or
inheritance
feast
of
his
father
had
taken
place
for
he
could
not
get
his
inheritance
before
that
time
according
to
ancient
custom
the
inheritance
feast
had
to
be
made
during
the
year
in
which
the
person
died
for
whom
the
inheritance
feast
was
made
and
the
man
who
gave
it
could
not
occupy
the
high
seat
of
him
from
whom
he
inherited
until
the
arvel
was
drunk
hjorvard
being
of
odin
s
family
and
a
powerful
hersir
the
feast
was
to
be
of
great
splendor
ivar
and
his
kinsmen
decided
that
it
should
take
place
ten
months
after
hjorvard
s
burning
journey
ivar
sent
ships
and
messengers
all
over
the
viking
lands
to
bid
men
and
kinsmen
to
come
and
make
the
feast
with
him
and
arrange
that
all
possible
honor
should
be
paid
to
hjorvard
his
father
according
to
ancient
laws
the
high
seat
of
hjorvard
was
to
remain
vacant
until
the
arvel
should
take
place
when
warriors
gathered
into
the
hall
the
empty
high
seat
of
the
departed
hersir
and
great
viking
chief
reminded
them
of
their
absent
friend
who
had
so
many
times
drunk
with
them
and
with
whom
they
had
gone
to
war
and
won
victory
and
wealth
in
the
evenings
the
scalds
who
had
been
with
him
in
all
his
fights
recited
before
the
assembled
guests
the
great
deeds
he
had
accomplished
and
which
they
had
seen
as
they
looked
upon
the
contending
foemen
from
the
or
wall
of
shields
that
surrounded
them
and
the
standards
they
told
of
many
fatal
combats
between
champion
and
champion
or
between
ship
and
ship
that
had
grappled
each
other
and
how
hjorvard
had
twice
during
his
life
cleared
of
warriors
the
decks
of
two
ships
things
followed
the
even
tenor
of
their
way
in
dampstadir
sigrlin
continued
to
superintend
the
estate
as
she
had
done
in
her
husband
s
time
when
he
was
on
viking
expeditions
ivar
helped
her
and
saw
that
the
ships
were
kept
in
perfect
order
and
well
tarred
and
painted
and
that
new
ones
were
built
the
slaves
dressed
in
their
white
woollen
coarse
stuff
with
short
cropped
hair
were
busy
with
the
different
tasks
assigned
to
them
and
the
free
servants
attended
to
their
work
ivar
himself
superintended
the
cultivation
of
the
lands
for
he
was
a
good
husbandman
and
sometimes
was
seen
forging
a
sword
or
superintending
the
construction
of
a
ship
as
a
pastime
he
often
played
chess
with
the
old
land
defenders
of
his
father
or
went
hawking
but
above
all
he
loved
to
sit
on
hjorvard
s
mound
from
there
he
contemplated
the
sea
the
paths
which
every
ship
had
made
ploughing
its
way
were
unseen
and
for
this
reason
one
of
the
figurative
names
given
to
the
sea
by
the
norsemen
was
the
unseen
path
one
day
as
ivar
was
seated
with
hjalmar
on
the
mound
of
hjovard
and
was
in
one
of
his
meditative
moods
he
said
after
all
hjalmar
a
man
is
not
utterly
unhappy
even
though
he
be
in
ill
health
some
are
happy
in
sons
or
in
daughters
some
in
kinsmen
some
in
much
wealth
some
in
good
deeds
and
some
in
friends
to
his
friend
a
man
should
be
a
friend
to
him
and
to
his
friend
but
no
man
should
be
the
friend
of
his
enemy
s
friend
if
thou
hast
a
friend
whom
thou
trustest
well
and
if
thou
wilt
get
good
from
him
thou
must
blend
thoughts
with
him
and
go
often
and
meet
him
be
never
the
first
to
forsake
the
company
of
thy
friends
sorrow
eats
the
heart
of
him
who
can
not
tell
all
his
mind
to
one
i
was
young
once
i
travelled
and
missed
my
way
when
i
met
another
man
i
thought
myself
wealthy
man
is
the
delight
of
man
the
fir
tree
withers
that
stands
on
a
fenced
field
neither
bark
nor
foliage
shelters
it
thus
is
a
man
whom
no
one
loves
why
should
he
live
long
brand
is
kindled
from
brand
till
it
is
burned
out
fire
is
kindled
from
fire
a
man
gets
knowledge
by
talking
with
man
it
is
long
out
of
one
s
way
to
go
to
one
you
do
not
like
though
he
lives
near
by
but
to
a
good
friend
there
are
short
paths
though
he
be
far
off
i
came
much
too
early
to
many
places
and
too
late
to
some
the
ale
was
drunk
or
it
was
unbrewed
an
unwelcome
man
seldom
finds
the
ale
then
he
added
a
homestead
is
best
though
it
be
small
for
a
man
is
at
home
there
though
he
have
but
two
goats
and
a
house
we
contemplate
many
a
humble
dwelling
from
here
in
many
of
these
happiness
and
joy
are
to
be
so
almost
always
than
in
the
halls
of
the
wealthy
the
fire
and
the
sight
of
the
sun
are
the
best
things
among
the
sons
of
men
then
his
good
health
and
a
blameless
life
if
he
can
keep
ivar
had
taken
great
pains
that
nothing
should
be
wanting
to
make
the
arvel
of
his
father
more
famous
than
any
one
that
had
taken
place
in
the
norseland
within
the
memory
of
man
he
had
had
two
large
festive
halls
built
for
a
great
number
of
guests
who
were
coming
nothing
had
been
spared
to
give
fame
to
the
arvel
which
was
to
last
two
weeks
several
great
hersirs
had
sent
word
to
him
that
they
were
coming
to
make
the
arvel
with
him
and
so
arrange
that
as
much
honor
as
possible
should
be
paid
to
hjorvard
his
father
the
hersirs
of
svithjod
gardariki
holmgard
fyen
and
zeeland
were
to
be
among
the
guests
a
fortnight
before
the
time
that
had
been
decided
for
the
arvel
the
people
who
lived
the
farthest
began
to
arrive
for
they
wanted
to
make
sure
that
no
contrary
winds
or
other
obstacle
should
cause
their
absence
the
day
appointed
for
the
beginning
of
the
feast
every
guest
was
present
it
was
according
to
ancient
custom
that
when
an
arvel
was
held
after
the
death
of
hersirs
and
men
he
who
gave
it
and
was
to
receive
the
inheritance
should
sit
on
the
step
in
front
of
the
high
seat
of
the
deceased
until
the
horn
called
bragi
s
horn
was
brought
in
when
he
had
to
rise
take
the
horn
make
a
vow
and
drain
it
to
the
bottom
after
this
he
was
to
be
led
to
the
high
seat
of
his
deceased
kinsman
and
was
then
the
owner
of
the
inheritance
before
taking
his
inheritance
in
presence
of
all
the
assembled
guests
ivar
seated
himself
on
the
steps
leading
to
the
high
seat
of
hjorvard
his
father
on
the
first
evening
many
horns
were
filled
and
drunk
to
the
memory
of
the
departed
kinsman
the
second
night
the
horns
to
odin
njord
and
frey
were
drunk
after
which
the
horn
to
bragi
was
filled
and
over
it
vows
were
made
the
scene
was
very
impressive
vow
after
vow
was
sworn
by
prominent
men
to
accomplish
some
great
deeds
that
would
be
known
all
over
the
northern
lands
then
ivar
rose
and
made
the
vow
that
within
two
years
he
would
avenge
the
death
of
his
father
or
die
in
the
attempt
closing
with
so
help
me
odin
njord
and
after
this
oath
his
kinsmen
led
him
into
the
high
seat
of
hjorvard
his
father
and
thenceforth
he
was
entitled
to
his
father
s
inheritance
after
the
feast
was
over
ivar
gave
costly
gifts
to
all
the
prominent
men
who
had
come
to
help
him
by
their
presence
and
minor
ones
to
those
less
prominent
who
had
come
with
them
and
all
departed
with
many
protestations
of
friendship
declaring
that
it
was
the
greatest
inheritance
feast
they
had
ever
seen
a
short
time
after
ivar
had
given
his
inheritance
feast
another
death
in
the
family
took
place
as
he
was
drinking
with
his
men
a
messenger
came
to
him
with
the
news
that
ingimund
one
of
his
uncles
living
in
the
eastern
part
of
the
island
on
the
shore
of
a
bay
called
tangvide
had
died
suddenly
in
his
high
seat
the
death
of
ingimund
caused
great
sorrow
among
all
the
people
for
he
was
much
beloved
and
many
went
to
him
for
advice
for
he
had
an
excellent
knowledge
of
the
laws
the
sorrow
about
his
death
was
the
greater
because
he
had
not
thrown
himself
down
from
some
high
cliff
from
whence
he
would
have
gone
to
valhalla
as
he
had
never
been
fated
by
the
nornir
to
die
on
the
and
by
weapons
he
had
intended
to
do
so
and
had
often
said
that
he
did
not
want
to
die
in
bed
for
it
was
the
custom
for
warriors
overtaken
by
old
age
to
die
by
throwing
themselves
from
cliffs
and
going
to
odin
thus
showing
that
they
were
not
afraid
of
death
ivar
and
many
of
the
people
of
dampstadir
made
ready
to
go
to
the
funeral
of
ingimund
when
they
reached
his
home
a
large
mortuary
chamber
of
solid
timber
was
made
and
a
cairn
thrown
over
it
leaving
the
entrance
to
the
chamber
free
great
preparations
were
made
for
the
journey
of
ingimund
to
hel
the
world
of
the
dead
who
had
not
died
in
arms
or
sought
valhalla
of
themselves
after
ivar
s
arrival
the
sons
of
ingimund
came
to
him
and
said
thou
art
the
head
of
our
kinsmen
and
thou
knowest
that
it
is
the
custom
from
immemorial
time
when
a
man
does
not
die
by
weapons
to
make
him
ready
for
his
journey
to
hel
we
ask
of
thee
to
put
the
on
the
feet
of
our
dead
father
for
as
thou
knowest
the
ancient
faith
that
has
come
down
to
us
tells
us
that
such
shoes
should
go
to
hel
with
the
man
that
takes
that
journey
therefore
we
will
dress
ingimund
splendidly
for
when
a
man
dresses
well
when
he
goes
out
of
our
world
and
is
a
long
time
in
dressing
he
is
said
to
prepare
himself
for
ivar
answered
i
will
put
and
tie
the
on
ingimund
s
feet
as
you
ask
the
shoes
were
put
on
after
he
had
tied
them
ivar
said
i
know
not
how
to
tie
if
these
are
unfastened
on
the
journey
to
then
he
asked
the
people
to
see
if
they
were
well
tied
after
looking
at
them
those
that
were
present
said
well
done
ivar
these
shoes
can
not
possibly
be
untied
and
the
journey
of
ingimund
to
hel
will
be
without
the
body
of
ingimund
was
dressed
superbly
he
was
clad
in
his
war
apparel
he
had
on
his
gold
and
wore
his
helmet
his
ornamented
shield
was
laid
on
his
breast
and
his
sword
by
his
side
his
rings
and
bracelets
of
gold
were
on
his
hands
and
arms
and
thus
he
was
laid
on
a
bed
in
the
mortuary
chamber
at
his
feet
and
at
his
head
were
put
several
beautiful
roman
and
greek
bronze
vases
some
exquisitely
beautiful
grecian
cups
of
glass
ornamented
with
fine
paintings
a
samian
vase
a
roman
sieve
of
bronze
a
pair
of
tweezers
of
gold
a
fine
and
other
objects
among
which
were
several
coins
of
diocletian
who
was
roman
emperor
at
the
time
then
as
the
chamber
was
closed
all
present
wished
ingimund
a
happy
journey
to
hel
and
to
this
day
the
stranger
sees
as
he
sails
along
the
eastern
shores
of

among
the
large
cairns
that
overlook

chapter

ivar
spurns
starkad
s
indemnity
starkad
who
had
given
the
mortal
wound
to
hjorvard
feared
ivar
s
enmity
and
that
of
his
kinsmen
and
and
wished
to
pay
weregild
or
indemnity
for
his
death
he
had
heard
of
the
vow
of
ivar
and
knew
that
sooner
or
later
he
would
avenge
the
death
of
his
father
for
there
was
a
saying
that
there
was
a
wolf
s
mind
in
a
son
accordingly
he
sent
a
man
called
nidud
a
great
warrior
to
dampstadir
to
offer
ivar
indemnity
when
nidud
came
to
the
banqueting
hall
the
men
were
seated
on
the
benches
round
the
fires
drinking
their
beloved
beer
mead
and
ale
on
his
arrival
all
became
silent
for
the
warriors
knew
that
great
news
was
to
be
told
ivar
bade
nidud
to
sit
on
the
second
high
seat
and
it
was
not
long
before
the
silence
was
interrupted
by
the
rising
of
nidud
who
in
a
chilling
voice
said
starkad
has
sent
me
here
to
thee
ivar
with
costly
presents
and
i
have
ridden
through
the
length
of
gotland
to
bid
thee
and
also
thy
to
his
hall
and
to
the
benches
facing
the
tables
come
all
with
your
helmets
to
get
honor
and
large
gifts
helmets
and
shields
swords
and
saxes
horses
and
costly
garments
gold
and
silver
and
large
estates
thou
ivar
will
get
indemnity
for
thy
father
s
death
and
be
reconciled
to
ivar
wondered
if
starkad
had
a
wolf
s
mind
and
meant
cunningly
and
treacherously
to
attack
him
with
an
overwhelming
host
if
he
came
with
but
few
men
he
answered
i
and
my
own
seven
halls
full
of
swords
their
hilts
are
of
gold
and
their
scabbards
are
ornamented
also
with
gold
our
swords
and
saxes
are
the
sharpest
our
brynjas
are
the
whitest
and
brightest
our
arrows
are
the
fleetest
our
spears
the
surest
our
horses
the
best
we
have
no
lack
of
gold
and
silver
for
our
treasures
are
among
the
greatest
in
the
northern
nidud
replied
here
is
the
message
and
invitation
in
writing
which
starkad
sends
thee
ivar
it
is
written
in
mystic
runes
and
he
handed
a
stick
on
which
the
invitation
had
been
written
then
ivar
read
the
message
and
turning
his
head
to
his
said
to
them
in
a
low
voice
i
shall
not
accept
his
invitation
and
the
indemnity
he
offers
to
i
wonder
at
his
offer
replied
hjalmar
he
has
seldom
done
this
before
for
he
is
of
a
miserly
mind
let
us
confer
together
so
ivar
told
nidud
they
would
give
him
an
answer
the
next
day
and
bidding
his
champions
to
entertain
nidud
and
his
men
until
he
came
back
left
the
hall
with
his
i
am
surprised
at
the
costly
things
starkad
has
sent
thee
said
sigurd
but
among
them
i
noticed
a
ring
with
a
wolf
s
hair
attached
to
it
i
think
some
one
warns
thee
and
us
that
he
has
a
wolf
s
mind
towards
us
and
means
it
must
be
some
woman
who
loves
us
replied
ivar
whom
do
we
know
among
women
in
starkad
s
realm
let
us
try
and
after
a
silence
which
lasted
some
time
during
which
the
two
remained
plunged
in
thought
hjalmar
said
herborg
the
lovely
must
have
tied
this
wolf
s
hair
there
pointing
to
the
ring
she
is
his
sister
and
thinks
well
of
us
i
am
sure
she
loves
thee
hjalmar
said
ivar
i
think
not
replied
his
but
i
believe
she
likes
us
very
much
and
has
for
us
the
greatest
friendship
it
is
just
like
a
noble
in
friendship
and
true
to
the
end
of
then
they
looked
carefully
at
the
kelfi
or
stick
upon
which
runic
messages
were
carved
or
written
when
suddenly
they
discovered
that
some
of
the
letters
had
been
changed
with
a
great
deal
of
skill
then
they
inspected
most
minutely
every
letter
and
found
that
with
the
invitation
there
was
also
a
warning
for
ivar
not
to
come
or
if
he
came
to
bring
many
warriors
and
champions
with
him
in
the
meantime
nidud
and
the
men
who
had
come
with
him
and
the
champions
of
ivar
drank
merrily
nidud
praising
highly
the
gifts
the
champions
were
to
receive
when
they
came
to
visit
starkad
sigrlin
was
not
long
in
hearing
of
the
invitation
of
starkad
and
the
following
morning
she
came
to
ivar
just
as
he
was
making
ready
to
go
to
the
banqueting
hall
and
said
to
him
ivar
i
had
a
dream
last
night
which
i
am
going
to
tell
thee
it
is
a
warning
of
the
gods
and
thou
must
not
what
was
the
dream
mother
ivar
inquired
it
seemed
to
me
thy
sheets
burned
in
fire
and
that
a
mighty
flame
burst
through
thy
here
lie
linen
clothes
for
which
thou
carest
little
they
will
soon
burn
answered
ivar
this
is
where
thou
didst
see
sheets
but
sigrlin
continued
i
thought
a
white
bear
had
come
in
here
he
broke
through
the
walls
he
shook
his
paws
so
that
we
were
frightened
he
caught
many
of
us
in
his
grasp
so
that
we
were
helpless
and
there
was
a
great
struggle
amongst
us
to
be
free
from
that
said
ivar
is
a
storm
that
will
arise
and
soon
become
violent
and
thy
white
bear
will
prove
a
from
the
i
thought
an
eagle
flew
in
here
persisted
sigrlin
through
the
length
of
the
house
it
bespattered
us
with
blood
that
forebode
i
thought
a
heavy
fight
it
was
the
shape
of
we
kill
cattle
speedily
when
we
see
blood
it
often
means
oxen
when
we
dream
of
eagles
replied
ivar
reassuringly
i
fancied
i
saw
a
gallows
made
for
thee
and
that
thou
wert
going
to
hang
thereon
i
thought
i
buried
thee
alive
i
saw
also
a
bloody
sword
drawn
out
of
thy
body
a
spear
i
thought
had
pierced
thy
side
wolves
howled
at
both
its
ends
it
is
sad
to
tell
of
such
a
dream
to
such
a
son
as
thou
art
but
thou
art
all
i
have
in
the
world
and
i
think
our
own
disirs
or
family
spirits
warn
us
of
danger
they
were
dogs
that
ran
instead
of
wolves
they
were
barking
it
seemed
to
me
that
a
river
ran
through
the
length
of
the
house
roaring
in
anger
rushing
over
the
benches
bruising
the
feet
of
thy
the
water
spared
nothing
this
forebode
something
i
am
sure
it
seemed
to
me
also
that
dead
women
came
hither
this
night
they
bade
thee
to
come
quickly
to
them
and
their
benches
this
must
forebode
something
i
say
again
that
i
fear
that
the
guardian
spirits
of
our
family
have
abandoned
thee
and
that
they
are
to
be
faithless
to
mother
be
not
afraid
returned
ivar
earnestly
dreams
are
not
always
warnings
from
the
gods
though
i
must
say
that
what
thou
tellest
me
is
strange
but
thou
knowest
well
that
no
one
can
escape
his
fate
and
what
the
nornir
have
decreed
must
take
then
they
separated
and
ivar
went
to
the
hall
his
mother
following
him
soon
afterwards
and
found
there
the
messengers
waiting
for
his
answer
to
the
invitation
of
starkad
the
hall
was
filled
with
guests
and
the
ale
was
passed
round
a
hush
fell
upon
the
throng
as
ivar
entered
and
in
the
midst
of
expectant
attention
anxious
looks
and
profound
silence
he
said
with
a
voice
loud
but
full
of
emotion
nidud
and
you
men
who
have
come
with
him
go
and
tell
starkad
your
lord
that
i
have
vowed
at
the
arvel
of
my
father
in
presence
of
my
kinsmen
and
kinswomen
and
of
the
of
the
land
and
of
the
men
of
great
renown
who
came
from
gaul
britain
and
the
remotest
countries
where
norsemen
have
settled
that
i
would
within
two
years
avenge
the
death
of
hjorvard
my
father
or
perish
in
the
attempt
tell
him
also
that
my
and
my
kinsmen
will
avenge
his
death
and
mine
if
i
fall
tell
starkad
that
there
is
no
weregild
large
enough
to
indemnify
me
for
the
death
of
my
father
and
that
when
he
slew
him
he
slew
one
of
the
bravest
and
most
of
men
tell
him
that
the
time
of
revenge
is
soon
well
answered
my
son
shouted
sigrlin
at
the
top
of
her
voice
the
kinsmen
of
hjorvard
are
not
all
dead
yet
and
starkad
will
find
it
these
utterances
were
received
with
loud
assent
on
the
part
of
ivar
s
followers
present
and
with
mortification
and
chagrin
by
the
messengers
of

furious
rush

ivar
with
a
blow

at

gnepi
too
fell
pierced
with
many
wounds
but
displaying
great
courage
to
the
end
then
ivar
seeing
the
havoc
made
by
ubi
and
fearful
that
his
host
would
become
demoralized
by
such
an
onslaught
said
to

thou

tell
her
how

when
apprised
of
the
great
danger
that
menaced
ivar
made
a
terrible
onset
on
starkad

host
first
she
attacked
the
champion
barri
dealing
him
blow
after
blow
and
so
quickly
that
he
could
only
protect
himself
with
his
shield
and
this
only
for
a
time
for
one
of
her
lightning
strokes

shield
and
giving
him
a
wound
that
disabled
him
she
left
him
then
styr
the
strong
met
her
they
attacked
each
other
with
great
fierceness
but
the
throng
of
warriors
was
so
great
that
they
were
separated
against
their
will
finally
after
slaying
toki
and
several
other
champions
whose
hard
fate
placed
them
in
her
path
and
after
exhibiting
the
greatest
valor
she
fell
herself
under
the
sword
of
the
champion
hjalti
after
her
fall
great
events
happened
in
a
short
time
first
one
array
then
another
getting
the
upper
hand
hundreds
of
men
on
either
side
were
doomed
never
to
return
home
and
great
was
the
host
which
was
to
enter
valhalla
when
the
evening
came
the
white
shields
were
raised
and
the
truce
proclaimed
the
combatants
went
to
their
tents
and
dressed
their
wounds
early
the
following
morning
the
conflict
was
renewed
after
the
battle
had
raged
fiercely
for
a
season
ivar
attacked
the
apex
of
the
array
of
starkad
his
father
s
sword
hrotti
shone
like
fire
and
he
cut
down
the
host
of
starkad
like
saplings
neither
helmet
nor
shield
could
withstand
his
blows
he
went
through
the
host
with
his
and
slew
all
those
who
were
in
his
way
the
heid
seeing
the
appalling
death
of
men
in
the
array
of
starkad
rushed
towards
ivar
many
men
engaged
in
single
combat
stopped
by
common
accord
to
see
the
conflict
her
fiery
steed
white
with
froth
seemed
to
enjoy
the
fray
heid
s
hair
was
loose
and
dishevelled
and
swung
to
and
fro
following
the
motion
of
her
body
her
eyes
seemed
to
send
out
flashes
of
fire
lightning
seemed
to
spring
from
her
sword
as
it
struck
that
of
ivar
never
in
his
life
had
ivar
been
so
hard
pressed
but
finally
the
pressure
of
other
combatants
separated
them
ubi
the
frisian
advanced
before
the
host
of
ivar
and
all
retraced
their
steps
before
him
so
deadly
were
his
blows
when
the
archers
recognized
him
they
said
we
will
not
shoot
elsewhere
but
let
us
all
aim
our
arrows
at
this
man
for
a
while
for
we
will
never
get
the
victory
until
he
is
the
most
skilled
archers
began
to
shoot
at
ubi
and
he
fell
at
last
but
not
before
arrows
had
been
sent
into
his
body
and
not
before
he
had
slain
six
champions
severely
wounded
eleven
others
and
killed
sixteen
sviar
and
gotlanders
that
stood
in
front
of
the
ranks
after
the
death
of
ubi
the
host
of
ivar
made
a
fierce
attack
on
the
host
of
starkad
and
nothing
could
resist
them
when
starkad
saw
this
great
slaughter
of
his
men
he
urged
his
host
not
to
let
one
man
overcome
all
such
valiant
and
proud
men
as
they
were
he
shouted
where
is
storkud
who
until
now
has
always
borne
the
shield
of
victory
storkud
who
was
near
answered
we
will
try
to
gain
a
victory
though
where
ivar
is
a
man
may
be
fully
he
rushed
to
the
front
towards
ivar
a
fierce
fight
ensued
and
storkud
fell
great
indeed
was
the
slaughter
of
men
when
heid
the
saw
so
many
valiant
men
fall
she
rushed
forward
and
however
valiant
and
skilful
a
man
was
in
the
handling
of
his
sword
he
was
almost
sure
to
meet
his
death
while
fighting
against
her
ivar
entreated
his
men
to
take
her
alive
but
she
would
not
be
taken
and
fell
fighting
furiously
as
she
fell
ivar
sang
sunk
to
the
ground
is
heid
the
the
sviar
have
slain
her
and
with
her
many
of
her
champions
she
was
more
at
home
in
the
fight
than
talking
with
a
wooer
or
going
to
the
bridal
bench
with
when
starkad
looked
over
the
wing
heid
commanded
and
saw
how
it
had
diminished
he
sang
many
were
we
when
we
drank
the
mead
now
we
are
fewer
when
we
should
be
more
i
do
not
see
one
among
my
men
who
can
carry
a
shield
and
meet
ivar
s
host
nevertheless
i
will
carry
a
shield
with
what
is
left
of
my
men
and
go
and
fight
the
gotlanders
and
their
then
he
advanced
towards
the
host
of
ivar
and
at
last
the
decisive
conflict
took
place
both
sides
fought
with
the
greatest
fury
the
field
of
battle
where
the
swords
met
appeared
like
a
lurid
sheet
of
fire
and
after
the
most
heroic
struggle
starkad
fell
with
his
standard
when
ivar
saw
that
the
standard
of
starkad
had
fallen
he
knew
that
he
was
dead
he
had
the
horns
blown
the
peace
shield
raised
and
shouted
an
order
that
the
battle
stop
when
the
host
of
starkad
became
aware
that
he
had
been
slain
the
combat
ceased
and
ivar
offered
truce
to
them
all
which
was
accepted
several
chiefs
became
his
vassals
and
promised
to
pay
him
tribute
every
year
and
send
men
to
his
standards
when
needed
ivar
putting
his
foot
on
their
necks
as
a
sign
that
he
had
become
their
ruler
after
the
battle
a
search
was
made
for
starkad
and
his
body
was
found
under
a
heap
of
slain
he
was
buried
with
his
sword
tyrfing
and
a
mound
was
raised
over
him
ivar
took
the
ships
belonging
to
starkad
had
them
dragged
ashore
and
built
on
their
decks
great
pyres
upon
these
he
placed
the
bodies
of
his
champions
that
had
fallen
and
he
and
those
who
were
present
threw
into
the
burning
flames
gold
and
silver
and
costly
weapons
to
do
them
honor

the
only
daughter
of
starkad
by

daughter
of

the
berserk
when
her
father
fell
she
was
only
ten
years
old
when
helga
gave
birth
to
hervor
most
people
thought
she
ought
to
be
exposed
and
said
that
she
would
not
have
the
character
of
a
woman
if
she
was
like
the
kinsmen
of
her
father
who
all
had
been
men
of
bad
repute
she
constantly
practised
riding
on
horseback
shooting
with
bows
the
handling
of
swords
and
shields
and
all
kinds
of
athletic
games
when
she
had
grown
up
she
became
a
and
loved
to
be
under
helmet
and
far
better
than
being
occupied
in
sewing
or
embroidering
from
the
age
of
fifteen
she
was
wont
to
say
that
the
kin
of
starkad
had
not
all
perished
and
she
thought
to
avenge
her
father
s
death
she
was
tall
and
strong
and
of
fair
complexion
her
long
silky
hair
was
of
the
color
of
red
gold
and
the
people
said
that
it
was
like
the
hair
of
sif
the
wife
of
the
god
thor
when
hervor
was
twenty
she
longed
to
have
tyrfing
the
sword
of
her
father
which
had
been
laid
in
his
mound
with
him
tyrfing
was
sharper
than
any
other
sword
and
when
it
was
drawn
from
its
scabbard
rays
of
light
sprang
from
its
blade
it
was
a
most
famous
sword
and
had
been
in
the
possession
of
the
family
of
starkad
and
kept
as
an
heirloom
for
many
generations
one
spring
hervor
left
her
home
all
alone
dressed
as
a
man
and
engaged
herself
on
board
of
a
viking
ship
whose
commander
and
crew
had
no
other
home
than
their
vessel
afterwards
they
sailed
and
plundered
in
many
places
until
at
last
their
leader
died
and
the
men
appointed
hervor
to
rule
over
them
they
sailed
for
the
place
where
her
father
and
his
fallen
warriors
had
been
buried
and
reached
it
towards
evening
and
anchored
their
ship
in
a
bay
and
remained
on
board
that
day
after
sunset
they
saw
large
fires
moving
to
and
fro
over
the
mounds
for
the
island

a
great
burial
place
these
fires
were
but
the
people
believed
they
were
supernatural
fires
the
crew
were
full
of
dread
and
said
that
they
never
would
go
ashore
in
the
evening
the
following
day
late
in
the
afternoon
hervor
landed
at
sunset
the
crew
thought
they
heard
hollow
noises
on
the
island
after
a
diligent
search
hervor
recognized
the
mound
of
her
father
for
it
stood
high
among
others
also
from
the
inscription
on
the
memorial
stone
as
she
came
near
it
she
sang
awake
starkad
hervor

me
the
sharp
sword

days
of

she
said
in
a
louder
voice

and
all
warriors

much
have
you
increased
the
mould
under
which
you
lie
i
call
you
all
to

have
the
sharp
sword
then
she
opened
the
mound
of
her
father
and
entering
the
mortuary
chamber
she
took
tyrfing
and
sailed
home
after
this
her
sole
object
in
life
was
to
avenge
the
death
of
starkad
the
following
year
she
assembled
a
great
host
and
made
war
against
ivar
but
perished
in
the
battle
after
performing
prodigies
of
prowess
and
valor
shortly
after
the
events
just
spoken
of
ivar
and
all
the
men
of
gotland
received
from
yngvi
the
hersir
of
svithjod
an
invitation
to
attend
and
participate
in
the
great
athletic
games
idrottir
that
were
to
take
place
the
following
spring
for
the
championship
of
the
norselands
for
like
the
spartans
the
norsemen
thought
highly
of
all
games
and
exercises
that
give
strength
and
suppleness
to
the
body
ivar
sent
back
word
by
the
messengers
that
he
was
coming
and
that
he
and
the
gotlanders
would
compete
in
the
different
games
with
those
who
strove
for
the
championship
also
to
try
to
wrest
it
from
those
who
held
it
then
he
sent
word
all
over
the
island
instructing
his
people
to
practise
the
games
with
great
zeal
and
energy
chapter
xx
the
session
of
the
thing
after
the
departure
of
the
messengers
of
the
hersir
of
svithjod
as
was
usual
at
that
time
of
the
year
a
great
thing
or
assembly
of
the
people
took
place
as
the
date
drew
near
ivar
sent
the
thing
arrow
to
all
the
thingmen
over
the
island
to
call
them
to
the
thing
place
to
punish
those
who
had
violated
the
laws
and
to
settle
other
matters
and
controversies
accordingly
the
thingmen
journeyed
to
dampstadir
either
on
horseback
or
in
ships
each
hauld
or
bondi
taking
with
him
a
large
retinue
of
followers
according
to
his
wealth
and
rank
the
person
of
every
thingman
was
holy
if
any
one
attempted
to
disturb
them
on
their
way
to
or
from
the
thing
he
was
declared
an
outlaw
the
multitude
came
without
their
weapons
for
on
the
thing
plain
perfect
peace
must
reign
and
any
one
breaking
it
by
insults
or
otherwise
was
accounted
without
the
pale
of
the
law
it
was
the
same
as
if
he
had
violated
the
temple
peace
he
was
regarded
as
a
wolf
in
the
sanctuary
an
outlaw
or
nithing
in
all
holy
or
inhabited
places
until
he
had
made
reparation
for
his
crime
the
thing
plain
where
the
people
met
was
not
far
from
the
temple
and
was
so
holy
that
it
could
not
be
sullied
by
bloodshed
arising
from
or
any
impurity
the
thing
from
the
time
it
was
opened
until
it
was
dissolved
was
under
the
protection
of
the
gods
in
the
centre
of
the
thing
plain
was
the
court
a
large
circle
which
was
surrounded
by
hazel
poles
supporting
ropes
these
ropes
were
called
vebonds
or
sacred
bands
inside
the
circle
sat
those
who
were
to
judge
the
case
brought
before
the
thing
no
judge
when
once
within
these
holy
precincts
was
allowed
to
leave
neither
could
an
outsider
enter
them
before
the
opening
of
the
thing
according
to
ancient
custom
ivar
sacrificed
a
large
bull
in
the
temple
in
the
presence
of
the
people
and
filled
the
sacred
bowl
that
stood
on
the
altar
with
its
blood
afterwards
he
took
the
oath
ring
which
stood
upon
the
altar
and
over
which
men
were
to
take
their
oaths
and
dipped
and
reddened
it
with
the
consecrated
blood
and
then
put
it
on
his
arm
and
then
he
with
the
hersirs
and
thingmen
made
their
way
to
the
thing
plain
and
took
their
places
in
the
court
which
stood
upon
an
eminence
from
which
all
who
were
assembled
could
see
them
and
all
that
took
place
within
the
sacred
precincts
ivar
then
made
known
the
boundaries
of
the
thing
reciting
in
a
loud
voice
the
following
formulary
with
laws
shall
our
land
be
built
and
not
be
laid
waste
by
lawlessness
but
he
who
will
not
allow
others
the
benefit
of
the
laws
shall
not
enjoy
them
a
murmur
of
assent
greeted
the
last
words
of
the
sentence
for
the
norsemen
were
above
all
a
people
and
as
obligatory
he
recited
the
declaration
of
peace
by
first
saying
i
establish
peace
among
all
men
then
every
thingman
that
was
to
judge
or
any
man
who
had
to
perform
legal
duties
took
an
oath
upon
the
ring
and
said
i
call
those
present
to
witness
that
i
take
oath
on
the
ring
according
to
law
to
defend
or
prosecute
this
case
and
give
the
evidence
verdict
or
judgment
which
i
know
to
be
the
most
true
and
right
and
lawful
so
help
me
frey
njord
and
the
first
case
brought
before
the
thing
was
that
of
a
hauld
who
had
wounded
a
man
in
a
fit
of
anger
thou
knowest
well
said
ivar
that
the
higher
a
man
is
in
station
the
greater
is
the
indemnity
to
be
paid
by
him
for
breaking
the
law
he
who
is
of
high
birth
ought
to
set
the
example
the
judgment
of
the
court
is
that
thou
shalt
pay
for
the
wound
thou
hast
inflicted
six
rings
of
gold
each
ring
weighing
twelve
aurar
which
is
six
times
the
amount
a
freeman
should
pay
for
the
same
offence
or
half
more
than
a
a
man
was
next
brought
up
for
stealing
while
on
a
trading
voyage
this
class
of
thieves
were
called
all
the
crew
of
the
vessel
was
present
thou
knowest
the
law
said
ivar
it
is
that
thy
head
shall
be
shaved
and
tarred
and
or
feathers
put
upon
it
then
the
crew
shall
make
a
road
for
thee
and
stand
on
both
sides
and
thou
shalt
run
to
the
woods
if
thou
canst
every
one
shall
throw
a
stick
or
a
stone
after
thee
and
whoever
does
not
throw
shall
pay
a
fine
of
nine
the
thief
was
tarred
and
feathered
a
road
was
made
for
him
between
the
sailors
he
ran
as
fast
as
he
could
but
he
had
hardly
reached
the
end
of
the
road
that
had
been
made
for
him
when
he
fell
exhausted
badly
wounded
a
bondi
came
before
the
court
and
declared
that
he
had
killed
two
robbers
who
tried
to
defend
themselves
well
hast
thou
done
for
these
men
were
unholy
and
thou
hast
no
indemnity
to
pay
for
their
lives
was
the
verdict
then
a
man
was
brought
up
who
had
committed
burglary
and
had
been
caught
with
arms
upon
him
thou
knowest
the
laws
said
ivar
again
thou
art
an
outlaw
and
shalt
die
men
like
thyself
the
land
does
not
a
case
was
next
brought
up
in
which
a
man
was
supposed
to
have
committed
murder
one
of
the
champions
of
hjorvard
named
asgrim
had
been
slain
and
the
people
who
were
there
were
unable
to
tell
who
was
the
slayer
but
it
was
suspected
that
a
man
by
the
name
of
asmund
had
done
the
deed
though
he
denied
the
accusation
vehemently
it
had
been
decided
at
a
preceding
thing
by
the
kinsmen
of
asgrim
that
asmund
should
take
an
oath
at
the
following
autumn
thing
which
was
the
one
now
taking
place
then
ivar
took
from
his
arm
the
oath
ring
and
in
presence
of
the
thingmen
and
of
the
multitude
asmund
named
two
witnesses
as
was
required
by
law
saying
i
choose
thorvald
and
olaf
as
witness
that
i
take
an
oath
upon
the
temple
ring
that
i
did
not
redden
point
and
edge
of
any
sword
where
asgrim
was
slain
i
know
this
oath
to
be
most
true
so
help
me
odin
frey
and
a
man
was
brought
up
that
had
been
caught
stealing
food
he
proved
that
he
had
stolen
to
sustain
life
and
that
he
had
gone
to
several
households
to
try
to
get
work
but
could
not
get
it
witnesses
came
forward
to
testify
that
he
had
come
to
their
houses
in
search
of
work
but
they
had
none
to
give
him
go
thy
way
said
ivar
for
though
the
law
is
that
no
man
shall
steal
from
another
nevertheless
it
also
declares
that
the
man
who
gets
no
work
to
live
by
and
steals
food
to
save
his
life
shall
not
be
one
man
was
brought
before
the
thing
who
had
been
caught
stealing
for
the
third
time
thou
art
irredeemable
said
ivar
thieving
is
born
in
thee
and
the
law
of
the
land
is
that
a
man
caught
three
times
stealing
must
be
hanged
for
thou
art
a
born
thief
and
must
pay
the
penalty
of
the
law
for
the
land
can
not
be
burdened
with
men
like
on
the
fourth
day
a
very
important
case
regarding
an
inheritance
came
before
the
court
there
was
a
bitter
feeling
between
the
parties
angry
words
followed
each
other
the
litigants
in
the
heat
of
passion
lost
their
heads
and
to
the
utter
astonishment
of
every
one
had
weapons
hidden
under
their
cloaks
and
suddenly
the
thing
ground
was
covered
with
blood
a
great
uproar
arose
the
multitude
was
such
a
thing
had
never
happened
before
at
dampstadir
the
men
who
had
committed
this
great
offence
were
outlawed
and
had
to
flee
for
their
lives
ivar
declared
that
the
plain
was
desecrated
by
the
blood
of
hate
and
consequently
no
holier
than
any
other
ground
and
that
no
thing
could
ever
take
place
there
again
then
ivar
with
the
thingmen
chose
another
thing
field
after
which
they
made
preparations
to
sail
for
upsalir
chapter
xxi
ivar
s
visit
to
yngvi
sigrlin
was
extremely
desirous
that
ivar
should
appear
at
the
games
and
before
the
daughters
of
the
hersir
of
svithjod
as
befitted
his
rank
and
wealth
for
several
months
she
had
been
preparing
his
outfit
ivar
himself
wanted
to
have
his
best
apparel
and
weapons
for
men
who
went
to
the
games
or
to
the
thing
wore
their
finest
garments
and
arms
when
everything
was
ready
and
before
they
were
packed
his
mother
called
him
and
asked
him
to
look
at
his
outfit
first
she
showed
him
the
cloaks
or
rather
mantles
these
were
made
of
woven
stuffs
that
had
come
from
the
caspian
and
were
very
costly
they
were
worn
over
the
shoulders
and
only
by
men
of
high
birth
they
were
similar
in
shape
to
the
or
military
cloak
of
the
romans
or
the
of
the
greeks
they
were
a
mark
of
dignity
and
honor
and
were
fastened
with
most
costly
brooches
they
were
of
variegated
red
blue
scarlet
and
bordered
with
a
wide
braid
of
different
colors
or
with
a
kind
of
lace
these
mantles
were
the
handsomest
and
most
costly
part
of
ivar
s
outfit
the
norsemen
took
great
pride
in
them
there
were
also
rain
and
dust
cloaks
the
silk
and
linen
underwear
such
as
vests
undershirts
drawers
silk
linen
and
woollen
shirts
were
like
ours
but
without
collars
attached
to
them
those
of
wool
were
of
varied
patterns
and
colors
kirtles
were
also
plentiful
they
were
longer
than
the
shirts
were
of
silk
linen
and
wool
these
were
put
over
the
shirts
and
worn
next
to
the
and
extended
somewhat
below
it
there
were
also
many
pairs
of
trousers
these
were
of
wool
almost
socks
and
legs
in
one
piece
ivar
thanked
his
mother
for
all
the
care
she
had
taken
in
selecting
his
outfit
which
could
not
be
more
elaborate
and
costly
he
himself
chose
the
weapons
he
was
to
take
with
him
for
there
was
nothing
of
which
the
vikings
were
more
proud
than
their
arms
his
were
unrivalled
for
beauty
and
quality
the
suits
or
brynjas
were
marvels
of
workmanship
and
one
of
them
was
of
gold
the
blades
of
his
swords
and
saxes
were
all
beautifully
damascened
and
their
hilts
were
and
their
scabbards
also
ornamented
with
gold
his
shields
were
and
adorned
with
superb
designs
representing
warlike
deeds
of
great
vikings
there
was
a
rich
assortment
of
leather
belts
with
buckles
of
gold
inlaid
with
precious
stones
some
of
these
buckles
were
enamelled
in
red
green
blue
and
black
the
norsemen
excelled
in
the
art
of
enamelling
a
large
collection
of
brooches
for
fastening
his
mantles
were
in
a
special
box
his
contained
combs
and
tweezers
of
gold
but
the
gems
in
jewellery
were
the
fastenings
of
his
these
were
of
bronze
covered
with
a
sheet
of
gold
of
exquisite
work
one
of
the
fastenings
had
a
rosette
in
the
centre
surrounded
by
nine
heads
but
the
other
circle
was
of
a
richness
of
design
in
which
the
artist
had
displayed
his
greatest
skill
and
taste
in
that
were
four
rosettes
at
equal
distance
from
each
other
between
each
of
these
was
a
figure
of
a
man
in
a
sitting
posture
which
perhaps
represented
ægir
the
god
of
the
sea
each
figure
was
surrounded
by
fishes
ducks
of
different
sizes
etc
his
riding
accoutrements
could
not
be
excelled
for
beauty
the
stirrups
were
of
silver
inlaid
with
gold
the
spurs
were
of
solid
gold
ornamented
with
exquisite
filigree
work
the
bridle
was
a
chain
all
those
who
were
to
go
with
him
were
also
to
dress
with
great
magnificence
and
their
riding
gear
and
weapons
were
to
vie
with
those
of
the
richest
men
of
the
land
the
fleet
of
which
took
ivar
and
his
retinue
to
svithjod
were
the
finest
ships
of
gotland
and
no
handsomer
ones
could
be
seen
in
the
viking
lands
their
gold
dragons
glowed
as
fire
when
the
sun
shone
upon
them
and
some
of
them
were
so
much
ornamented
that
their
entire
hulls
seemed
to
be
of
gold
they
carried
handsome
striped
sails
of
different
colors
red
and
blue
stripes
predominating
their
pennants
and
standards
were
the
shields
that
were
to
hang
outside
along
the
gunwales
had
gold
rims
and
were
painted
in
yellow
and
black
or
red
and
white
so
that
their
effect
as
they
lay
side
by
side
overlapping
each
other
was
very
striking
fifteen
provision
ships
followed
the
fleet
two
of
these
carried
some
superb
horses
which
ivar
intended
as
a
present
for
the
hersir
of
svithjod
for
gotland
was
celebrated
for
its
breed
of
horses
among
the
horses
were
thoroughbred
stallions
of
dark
chestnut
color
ivar
was
to
present
him
also
with
a
new
sheeted
with
thin
gold
above
the
hjalmar
sigurd
and
sigmund
had
joined
ivar
each
with
a
handsome
skeid
after
an
uneventful
voyage
the
fleet
sighted
the
shores
of
svithjod
and
soon
afterwards
arrived
opposite
the
fjord
leading
to
lake
malar
the
fastest
vessels
let
down
their
sails
cast
anchor
and
waited
for
those
lagging
behind
and
when
they
had
come
in
sight
of
each
other
the
shields
were
hung
outside
of
the
gunwales
of
every
vessel
the
peace
shields
were
hoisted
and
the
standards
of
the
different
vikings
were
seen
floating
gracefully
on
the
breeze
the
fleet
remained
at
anchor
for
the
night
and
next
morning
the
horns
were
sounded
for
the
anchors
to
be
raised
and
to
move
forward
the
wind
was
fair
and
fresh
and
as
the
ships
sailed
they
passed
by
many
small
hamlets
nestling
in
nooks
along
the
picturesque
shore
slaves
in
their
white
garments
were
seen
tilling
the
soil
or
cutting
down
trees
that
were
to
be
used
in
the
construction
of
houses
or
vessels
the
harvest
had
taken
place
and
rye
barley
and
oats
were
still
stacked
in
the
field
everything
was
peaceful
but
behind
these
hills
and
these
forests
lived
the
sviar
or
the
sueones
of
the
romans
and
their
kindred
the
bravest
and
most
daring
people
the
roman
empire
had
ever
come
in
contact
with
the
fjord
leading
towards
lake
malar
had
in
those
days
about
the
same
appearance
as
their
granite
walls
protected
them
against
the
daughters
of
ægir
and
ran
island
after
island
lined
the
coast
and
the
entrance
of
the
fjord
and
the
shores
were
clad
in
many
places
with
woods
and
forests
of
gigantic
oak
and
pine
and
some
which
witnessed
the
scenes
i
describe
are
still
to
be
seen
here
and
there
when
evening
came
the
horns
sounded
for
the
vessels
to
cast
anchor
for
the
night
the
following
morning
at
dawn
of
day
the
ships
were
again
under
way
the
voyage
drew
towards
its
end
lake
malar
was
entered
the
old
town
of
sigtuna
came
in
sight
and
soon
afterwards
they
cast
anchor
for
the
last
time
then
ivar
two
of
his
uncles
his
three
and
the
men
of
high
birth
who
had
followed
him
left
their
ships
and
landed
all
were
splendidly
attired
ivar
wore
over
his
shoulders
a
superb
red
cloak
and
his
followers
likewise
these
cloaks
were
so
long
that
their
swords
could
not
be
seen
under
them
they
mounted
their
horses
which
had
been
sent
ashore
they
rode
slowly
along
with
their
hawks
resting
on
their
shoulders
or
on
their
wrists
ivar
s
hawk
was
called
habrok
and
was
very
famous
on
account
of
its
skill
in
catching
large
birds
and
hares
every
man
in
that
retinue
looked
every
inch
a
warrior
their
mustaches
which
only
men
could
wear
gave
them
a
martial
appearance
their
hair
hung
gracefully
on
their
necks
from
under
their
shining
bright
helmets
ivar
wore
a
golden
helmet
the
watchmen
in
the
towers
at
upsalir
had
seen
ivar
and
his
following
coming
and
told
yngvi
of
their
approach
saying
to
him
there
glitter
in
the
sunshine
helmets
splendid
shields
and
axes
and
spears
the
men
look
very
valiant
those
must
be
some
of
thy
guests
and
from
their
bearing
they
are
high
the
people
watched
them
as
they
rode
towards
upsalir
when
they
arrived
in
front
of
the
gate
they
stopped
and
after
it
was
opened
they
entered
the
large
square
or
town
and
went
to
the
great
banqueting
hall
dismounted
near
the
door
and
then
went
in
yngvi
was
seated
on
his
high
seat
and
received
ivar
and
his
kinsmen
and
warriors
with
great
courtesy
and
bade
him
be
seated
as
a
mark
of
honor
in
the
second
high
seat
yngvi
was
of
medium
height
he
wore
a
long
flowing
white
beard
for
he
was
of
that
age
when
hersirs
wore
beards
instead
of
a
moustache
he
had
deep
blue
eyes
and
a
benevolent
countenance
and
was
clad
in
a
long
flowing
robe
of
great
beauty
embroidered
all
over
with
gold
he
looked
at
ivar
intently
for
a
while
what
were
his
thoughts
nobody
could
tell
but
probably
he
was
trying
to
read
the
character
of
the
son
of
hjorvard
his
kinsman
he
perhaps
also
thought
that
one
of
his
daughters
would
make
a
good
match
by
marrying
the
son
of
hjorvard
ivar
was
tall
and
strong
his
physique
under
the
constant
training
of
athletic
games
was
superb
his
features
were
regular
his
cheeks
rather
prominent
his
nose
was
aquiline
his
eyes
of
a
most
beautiful
deep
blue
and
when
looking
at
you
seemed
to
search
your
innermost
thoughts
and
his
long
hair
was
fair
and
silky
in
the
evening
there
was
great
feasting
and
drinking
but
the
daughters
of
the
hersir
of
svithjod
did
not
make
their
appearance
wonderful
indeed
was
upsalir
and
it
was
not
strange
that
its
fame
extended
far
and
wide
for
it
was
the
most
beautiful
burg
in
all
the
northern
lands
the
buildings
and
houses
that
faced
the
immense
quadrangle
which
they
surrounded
made
an
extraordinary
sight
there
were
houses
with
wooden
walls
that
had
stood
the
storms
of
centuries
some
of
which
it
was
believed
had
been
built
by
frey
himself
what
oaks
and
fir
trees
had
been
used
in
the
construction
of
these
buildings
the
timbers
had
become
so
hardened
on
account
of
the
resin
having
been
absorbed
by
the
fibres
of
the
wood
that
they
seemed
indestructible
gold
and
silver
had
not
been
spared
in
the
inside
ornamentation
of
many
of
these
structures
the
best
architects
and
artists
of
those
days
had
been
employed
in
their
construction
ornamentation
and
carvings
many
of
these
houses
looked
very
weird
and
fantastic
and
were
of
the
same
style
of
architecture
as
those
of
dampstadir
but
of
an
earlier
date
among
those
structures
stood
one
finer
than
all
the
others
this
was
the
great
banqueting
hall
famed
all
over
the
norselands
on
account
of
its
splendor
size
and
peculiar
outside
ornamentation
of
gargoyles
the
two
doors
leading
into
the
interior
were
marvellous
specimens
of
carving
the
represented
the
different
ceremonies
attending
the
funeral
of
baldr
according
to
norse
belief
and
a
heavy
gold
knocker
adorned
each
door
the
hall
itself
was
superb
the
walls
were
adorned
with
carvings
and
represented
a
sacrifice
made
to
odin
and
many
other
religious
subjects
shields
hung
all
along
the
walls
and
these
were
all
adorned
with
gold
and
with
beautiful
designs
many
telling
of
the
great
deeds
of
the
heroes
of
the
race
they
had
been
collected
by
each
successive
ruler
of
svithjod
or
had
been
given
to
them
as
presents
by
the
most
renowned
smiths
of
the
day
tapestries
hung
where
there
was
no
carving
and
these
had
been
chiefly
embroidered
by
the
daughters
and
wives
of
the
hersirs
who
had
ruled
over
upsalir
here
was
a
tapestry
representing
ships
gliding
over
the
water
with
their
dragons
another
represented
a
body
of
men
dressed
in
war
costume
ready
to
land
many
were
hunting
scenes
with
dogs
or
hawks
the
collection
of
grecian
glass
gathered
by
different
rulers
such
as
bowls
cups
beakers
and
drinking
horns
was
exquisite
there
were
goblets
with
greek
inscriptions
upon
them
a
beautiful
bowl
of
glass
of
sapphire
color
was
partly
encircled
with
a
delicate
open
silver
work
showing
the
color
of
the
glass
behind
all
these
objects
illustrated
the
great
taste
and
refinement
of
those
who
had
collected
them
and
told
of
the
high
civilization
of
those
times
in
the
north
there
were
numbers
of
roman
and
greek
bronze
vessels
of
most
graceful
forms
showing
the
roman
and
greek
art
at
its
best
in
that
particular
branch
of
industry
some
of
these
vessels
were
fluted
on
the
sides
and
the
fastenings
of
the
handles
represented
winged
women
s
heads
lions
or
other
graceful
figures
upon
one
of
these
vases
was
a
latin
inscription
in
letters
of
silver
roman
and
greek
statuettes
of
bronze
of
men
and
women
were
scattered
here
and
there
but
the
objects
which
yngvi
prized
more
than
any
others
were
a
collection
of
roman
coins
anterior
to
augustus
of
the
time
of
the
republic
these
had
been
coined
by
patrician
families
and
showed
that
the
sviar
made
voyages
to
the
mediterranean
and
incursions
along
its
shores
long
before
our
era
as
yngvi
showed
them
to
ivar
he
said
many
of
our
kinsmen
have
been
buried
on
the
mediterranean
for
in
the
time
of
the
etruscan
they
traded
there
and
their
graves
are
seen
to
this
day
in
that
country
and
can
be
easily
recognized
for
they
are
exactly
like
those
found
in
the
among
the
valuable
objects
from
the
north
were
two
large
and
superb
drinking
horns
made
of
bands
of
gold
with
figures
in
work
having
strange
mythical
representations
among
which
were
men
shields
swords
horned
men
men
on
horseback
stars
pigs
snakes
fishes
deer
and
other
animals
each
of
these
horns
weighed
between
seven
and
eight
pounds
there
were
other
vessels
of
silver
with
beautiful
work
in
gold
near
the
rim
representing
deer
birds
and
animals
which
were
of
greek
or
roman
origin
in
this
hall
the
most
sumptuous
entertainments
were
given
but
only
on
great
occasions
or
when
mighty
chiefs
came
on
a
visit
or
when
a
wedding
took
place
then
the
scalds
recited
in
the
evening
by
the
light
of
heavy
wax
candles
the
deeds
of
the
forefathers
and
the
great
warriors
of

to
those
who
were
around

the
high

were
of

above

of
yngvi
hung
his
sword
with
the
peace

round
it
under
it
were
his
helmet
and
shield
not
far
from
upsalir
were
the
idrottir
grounds
or
athletic
fields
a
place
famed
all
over
the
north
the
name
idrottir
was
applied
to
all
bodily
and
mental
exercises
men
practised
there
all
kinds
of
games
and
gymnastic
exercises
the
most
important
championship
games
took
place
in
the
spring
before
men
left
upon
viking
expeditions
and
in
the
autumn
when
they
had
returned
home
old
and
young
were
equally
eager
for
these
contests
when
a
ship
was
at
anchor
near
the
shore
the
crew
always
landed
to
play
games
no
opportunity
was
ever
lost
when
the
occasion
allowed
them
to
practise
to
gain
the
championship
of
the
herad
was
considered
a
great
honor
but
a
still
greater
one
was
to
gain
that
of
several
herads
when
many
men
were
pitted
against
each
other
but
the
contest
that
was
to
take
place
for
the
championship
of
all
the
norselands
was
on
a
far
greater
scale
and
was
to
be
a
memorable
occasion
in
the
lives
of
those
who
were
to
become
contestants
chapter
xxii
yngvi
s
poets
and
champions
yngvi
had
gathered
round
him
the
greatest
champions
of
the
northern
lands
when
a
warrior
had
achieved
great
fame
and
had
obtained
the
championship
in
any
game
of
strength
or
dexterity
or
was
a
great
berserk
and
gained
the
victory
over
some
celebrated
warrior
he
made
his
way
to
upsalir
for
the
hersir
of
svithjod
was
convivial
liberal
and
lavish
of
his
gold
to
his
men
no
one
had
ever
repented
of
serving
him
or
of
following
him
in
battle
some
of
the
where
his
wealth
was
kept
were
literally
filled
with
gold
and
silver
fine
swords
and
beautiful
weapons
costly
garments
and
cloaks
and
other
things
which
were
to
be
given
away
to
those
who
served
him
faithfully
or
who
came
to
visit
him
for
it
was
the
custom
never
to
let
the
guest
depart
the
best
of
the
land
were
constantly
working
for
him
yngvi
as
was
customary
with
great
hersirs
kept
always
twelve
champions
every
one
of
these
was
a
famous
berserk
and
the
hersir
of
svithjod
prided
himself
on
the
fact
that
his
champions
were
the
strongest
most
agile
and
skilful
warriors
in
the
land
though
once
in
a
while
a
new
man
would
come
and
show
that
no
one
can
be
best
in
everything
it
was
the
custom
of
the
berserks
when
they
were
in
upsalir
and
came
to
the
hall
first
to
go
and
salute
yngvi
then
to
walk
up
to
every
stranger
and
ask
him
if
he
thought
himself
their
equal
and
if
any
one
dared
to
say
that
he
was
then
their
anger
and
eagerness
to
fight
increased
they
began
to
frown
and
shout
loudly
saying
to
the
man
darest
thou
to
fight
us
then
thou
wilt
need
more
than
big
words
or
boasting
we
will
try
how
much
there
is
in
but
if
yngvi
interposed
saying
these
men
are
my
guests
and
have
come
to
see
me
then
there
was
no
fighting
most
of
them
in
time
of
peace
went
about
the
country
and
challenged
men
to
fight
duels
if
they
would
not
do
their
will
or
went
on
expeditions
in
countries
to
gather
wealth
it
was
their
custom
when
they
were
only
with
their
own
men
and
found
the
berserk
fury
coming
over
them
to
go
away
and
wrestle
with
trees
or
rocks
as
i
have
already
said
otherwise
they
would
have
slain
their
friends
in
their
frenzy
for
when
they
were
in
that
state
they
lost
their
reason
but
in
s
life
they
were
not
so
bad
to
have
intercourse
with
if
they
were
not
offended
though
they
were
most
overbearing
if
their
pride
or
renown
were
at
stake
all
of
yngvi
s
berserks
had
drunk
of
the
blood
of
wolves
and
eaten
of
their
hearts
in
order
to
become
fearless
and
they
had
succeeded
very
well
in
that
respect
for
they
were
feared
and
dreaded
everywhere
but
now
and
then
they
found
a
man
to
be
their
equal
and
they
had
to
admit
him
to
fellowship
with
them
they
had
made
a
vow
never
to
flee
from
fire
and
it
was
told
of
them
that
one
day
when
they
were
visiting
in
the
country
with
yngvi
the
cheer
was
so
good
and
the
drinks
were
so
strong
that
they
fell
fast
asleep
and
then
fire
was
set
to
the
hall
by
some
enemy
one
of
the
champions
woke
first
and
seeing
the
hall
nearly
full
of
smoke
called
out
now
it
will
suffocate
our
hawks
and
then
again
lay
down
to
sleep
then
another
saw
the
hall
burning
and
said
wax
will
now
drop
from
our
saxes
and
then
lay
down
again
but
when
yngvi
awoke
he
rose
and
roused
the
warriors
and
told
them
to
arm
themselves
they
then
rushed
at
the
walls
with
such
force
that
the
joints
of
the
timbers
broke
and
then
the
berserk
rage
came
at
once
upon
them
but
those
who
had
set
fire
to
the
house
had
fled
and
there
was
no
enemy
to
fight
so
they
wrestled
with
trees
and
rocks
while
their
berserk
fury
lasted
yngvi
thought
a
great
deal
of
his
berserks
and
allowed
them
a
great
deal
of
latitude
for
he
knew
that
in
life
one
must
overlook
many
things
in
order
to
be
happy
and
he
knew
their
disposition
they
in
return
loved
him
dearly
and
everyone
was
ready
to
lose
his
life
for
him
at
his
bidding
but
rulers
who
had
good
champions
were
very
shy
of
risking
their
lives
unnecessarily
one
of
his
favorite
champions
was
svipdag
and
the
way
he
had
come
to
him
was
this
his
father
the
bondi
svip
lived
far
away
from
other
men
he
was
wealthy
and
had
been
one
of
the
greatest
of
champions
and
was
not
at
all
what
he
looked
like
as
he
knew
many
things
and
was
very
wise
he
had
three
sons
svipdag
geigad
and
hvitserk
who
was
the
oldest
they
were
all
strong
and
men
when
svipdag
was
eighteen
winters
old
he
said
one
day
to
his
father
our
life
here
in
the
mountains
in
valleys
and
unsettled
places
where
men
never
visit
nor
receive
visits
is
dull
it
would
be
better
to
go
to
yngvi
and
follow
him
and
his
champions
if
he
will
receive
svip
who
wanted
to
persuade
him
from
doing
so
answered
i
do
not
think
this
advisable
for
his
men
are
jealous
and
svipdag
answered
a
man
must
risk
something
if
he
wishes
to
get
fame
he
can
not
know
before
he
tries
when
luck
will
come
to
his
father
finally
gave
him
a
large
axe
and
said
to
his
son
be
not
greedy
do
not
boast
for
that
gives
a
bad
reputation
but
defend
thyself
if
attacked
for
a
great
man
should
boast
little
and
behave
well
in
he
also
gave
him
good
war
accoutrements
and
a
good
horse
then
svipdag
rode
and
at
night
came
to
upsalir
he
saw
that
games
were
taking
place
outside
the
hall
yngvi
sat
on
a
large
gold
chair
and
his
berserks
were
near
him
when
svipdag
came
the
gate
of
the
burg
was
shut
for
it
was
then
customary
to
ask
leave
to
ride
in
svipdag
did
not
take
that
trouble
and
forced
open
the
gate
and
rode
into
the
town
then
yngvi
said
this
man
comes
here
recklessly
as
this
has
never
been
done
before
it
may
be
that
he
has
great
strength
and
has
no
the
berserks
at
once
got
very
angry
and
thought
that
he
asserted
himself
too
much
svipdag
rode
before
yngvi
and
saluted
him
well
in
a
skilful
manner
yngvi
asked
who
he
was
and
he
answered
i
am
the
son
of
the
bondi
then
yngvi
soon
recognized
him
and
every
one
thought
he
was
a
great
and
champion
the
games
were
continued
svipdag
sat
and
looked
on
the
berserks
eyed
him
angrily
and
said
to
yngvi
that
they
wanted
to
try
him
and
yngvi
answered
i
think
that
he
has
no
little
strength
but
i
should
like
you
to
try
whether
he
is
such
a
man
as
he
considers
when
every
one
came
into
the
hall
after
the
games
were
over
the
berserks
walked
toward
svipdag
and
asked
him
if
he
was
a
champion
as
he
made
so
much
of
himself
he
answered
that
he
was
as
great
a
champion
as
any
of
them
at
these
words
their
anger
and
their
eagerness
to
fight
increased
but
yngvi
told
them
to
be
quiet
that
evening
they
began
to
frown
and
howled
loudly
and
said
to
svipdag
darest
thou
to
fight
us
then
wilt
thou
need
more
than
thy
boasting
we
will
try
how
much
there
is
in
svipdag
answered
i
will
consent
to
fight
one
at
a
time
and
will
see
if
more
can
be
in
the
morning
a
great
duel
began
and
there
was
no
lack
of
heavy
blows
the
knew
how
to
use
his
sword
with
great
strength
and
skill
and
the
berserks
gave
way
svipdag
killed
one
and
then
another
wanted
to
avenge
him
yngvi
stopped
the
fight
and
made
peace
between
them
and
then
he
made
them
swear
after
which
he
said
to
svipdag
great
loss
hast
thou
caused
me
by
killing
one
of
my
berserks
but
i
see
that
thou
canst
more
than
fill
his
place
and
henceforth
thou
will
be
one
of
my
but
of
all
his
and
men
yngvi
valued
his
scalds
the
most
they
were
placed
on
the
second
high
seat
when
no
strangers
were
entertained
so
that
he
could
see
them
one
of
them
was
odun
the
satirist
so
named
because
he
only
recited
and
composed
satirical
songs
he
was
the
oldest
bard
and
had
been
the
scald
of
yngvi
s
father
but
his
greatest
scald
was
haldor
who
was
not
quick
of
speech
when
he
spoke
in
prose
but
poetry
was
very
easy
to
him
and
he
always
answered
in
verse
and
songs
flowed
from
him
as
fast
as
he
could
think
all
the
scalds
of
yngvi
were
also
famous
warriors
and
while
he
went
into
warfare
they
were
always
in
his
looking
on
and
singing
the
praises
of
the
most
valiant
one

of
two
astrid
was
randalin
twenty
and
gunnhild
nineteen
years
of
age
astrid
was
so
fair
that
wise
men
of
the
country
said
that
she
was
the
most
beautiful
maiden
in
all
the
northern
lands
her
hair
was
so
long
and
thick
that
she
could
cover
her
whole
body
with
it
it
was
as
fine
as
silk
and
of
the
color
of
amber
with
a
tinge
of
gold

was
somewhat

a
graceful
and
slender

an
extremely
handsome
head
her
features
were
perfect
her
nose
was
grecian
in
shape
like
those
of
her
ancestors
and
her
eyes
were
soft
and
dreamy
deep
blue
contrasting
charmingly
with
her
clear
and
fresh
complexion
the
bloom
of
her
cheeks
had
that
exquisite
soft
pink
tinge
which
diffused
itself
into
her
white
skin
as
delicate
as
apple
blossoms
floating
on
milk
or
the
hues
of
the
most
lovely
carnation

small
and

generations

walk
was
dignified
for
a
girl
of
her
age
and
to
add
to
all
her
charms
she
had
a
sweet
and
soft
voice
without
which
no
woman
is
perfect
randalin
was
of
medium
height
somewhat
stouter
than
astrid
with
a
body
due
to
constant
exercise
for
she
was
fond
of
riding
and
walking
she
had
the
features
of
her
father
and
was
very
much
like
him
in
many
ways
her
eyes
were
also
blue
but
her
cheeks
were
ruddier
than
those
of
her
eldest
sister

was
very
accomplished
and
learned
and
had
been
taught
to
speak
greek
by
one
of
her
bondwomen
who
had
been
captured
in

loved
the
society
of
the
wise
and
of
scalds

admired
above

to
her
were
nothing
without

and
good
manners

the
youngest
daughter
was
of
the

height
as
her
eldest
sister
she
had
thick
chestnut

exactly
like
those
of
her
mother
her
nose
was
straight
her

talked
or
smiled
showed
two
rows
of
beautiful
small
teeth
her
complexion
browned
easily
in
the
sun
during
the
summer
months
and
her
pink
cheeks
looked
the
more
beautiful
through
the
darkened
skin
she
was
by
far
the
most
coquettish
of
all
the
sisters
and
extremely
lively
and
witty
and
loved
to
see
men
young
and
old
captive
at
her
feet
she
had
the
faculty
of
making
the
last
man
that
she
spoke
to
believe
that
he
was
the
favorite
but
though
much
courted
she
did
not
know
what
love
was
and
could
not
have
loved
even
if
she
had
tried
these
three
sisters
had
very
aristocratic
manners
they
seemed
to
have
been
born
to
rule
and
appeared
in
every
way
descended
from
high
lineage
and
were
every
inch
daughters
of
hersirs
they
were
so
beautiful
that
the
people
believed
that
the
nornir
had
at
their
birth
fated
them
to
be
the
fairest
among
the
fair
daughters
of
earth
and
had
also
gifted
them
with
all
the
loveliness

their
presence
at

games
always
incited
the
players
to
greater
feats
the
scalds
became
more
inspired
and
every
guest
tried
his
best
to
be
foremost
in
their
good
graces
many
a
great
warrior
sons
of
powerful
hersirs
and
foremost
in
all
kinds
of
athletic
games
had
undertaken
daring
and
dangerous
expeditions
in
the
roman
empire
and
elsewhere
and
had
challenged
the
greatest
champions
of
the
land
to
combat
and
performed
acts
of
great
valor
and
prowess
in
order
that
their
deeds
might
be
sung
by
the
scalds
before
the
daughters
of
the
hersir
of
svithjod
for
they
were
considered
the
greatest
prizes
in
the
viking
lands
and
no
one
but
those
of
odin
s
kin
could
ever
aspire
to
become
their
husbands
no
chief
s
son
had
yet
been
so
bold
as
to
ask
one
of
them
in
marriage
for
they
all
feared
that
they
had
not
accomplished
deeds
of
valor
great
enough
to
permit
them
to
hope
to
win
their
hearts
for
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
which
the
vikings
admired
more
than
charming
women
towards
all
they
were
the
soul
of
chivalry
these
three
sisters
lived
in
their
skemma
or
bower
there
they
sewed
embroidered
and
did
other
handiwork
attended
by
their
free
servants
or
bondwomen
and
there
they
received
their
friends
each
of

owned
several
bondwomen
to

they
were
much
attached

who
were
regarded

prided
herself
upon

for

for
some
reason
the
sisters
had
not
made
their
appearance
in
the
hall
since
the
arrival
of
ivar
and
there
was
great
curiosity
to
see
them
among
those
who
had
never
been
to
upsalir
and
every
day
many
eyes
were
turned
towards
their
bower
trying
to
get
glimpses
of
their
fair
forms
men
dressed
in
their
best

their
moustaches
and
parted
their
long
hanging
hair
carefully

were
most
particular
in
their
toilets
when

not
be

most
intelligent

was

she
had
attained
her
eighteenth
year
the
preceding
spring
her
large
hazel
eyes
were
full
of
poetry
and
fire
and
when
she
looked
at
one
it
seemed
as
if
she
read
the
inmost
thoughts
of
one
s
mind
her
broad
forehead
showed
intellect
and
her
head
was
adorned
with
a
mass
of
light
brown
hair
when
she
smiled
she
showed
a
bewitching
set
of
pearly
teeth
she
was
full
of
life
and
was
not
ashamed
to
say
that
she
preferred
men
s
society
to
that
of
women
the
third
evening
when
the
men
of
highest
lineage
had
assembled
in
the
great
banqueting
hall
and
were
seated
in
their
respective
seats
astrid
her
two
younger
sisters
and
all
their
feminine
guests
entered
the
hall
a
murmur
of
admiration
greeted
them
and
no
wonder
for
it
had
never
happened
within
the
recollection
of
the
oldest
men
that
so
many
and
beautiful
maidens
daughters
of
chiefs
who
ruled
over
powerful
realms
and
who
were
of
odin
s
kin
had
been
in
upsalir
at
the
same
time
it
was
certainly
the
greatest
gathering
of
men
and
women
within
the
recollection
of
anyone
the
flower
of
womanhood
was
there
and
all
that
was
chivalrous
and
brave
in
the
land
had
come
also
each
maiden
had
in
her
hand
a
drinking
horn
of
gold
filled
either
with
mead
ale
or
wine
and
she
offered
it
to
the
guests
afterwards
lots
were
drawn
by
the
warriors
to
decide
where
they
were
to
sit
and
fortunate
were
the
men
who
had
drawn
the
lots
which
permitted
them
to
be
by
the
side

as
a

they
talked
much
to
each
other
during
the
evening
and
were
delighted
at
their
good
fortune
and
all
hoped
to
have
the
same
chance
again
so
pleased
were
they
with
each
other
it
happened
thereafter
that
almost
always
the
four
had
as
companions
the
same
maidens
which
attracted
everyone
s
notice
and
as
they
enjoyed
so
much
each
other
s
society
many
began
to
think
that
more
than
one
wedding
would
take
place
within
a
year
among
them
the
day
before
the
games
took
place
astrid
had
a
dream
in
which
her
disir
appeared
to
her
every
family
in
these
norselands
had
like
the
etruscans
and
romans
their
guardian
spirits
their
belief
and
worship
of
them
corresponded
somewhat
to
that
of
the
lares
and
penates
of
the
romans
the
disir
were
supposed
to
watch
over
every
individual
member
of
the
family
these
were
thought
to
be
the
representatives
of
the
departed
and
when
there
was
danger
ahead
often
made
their
appearance
in
dreams
to
warn
them
in
time
they
always
appeared
in
the
shape
of
women
astrid
had
dreamt
that
as
she
was
standing
outside
of
her
house
and
while
looking
over
the
sea
she
saw
a
woman
walking
over
the
waves
and
directing
her
steps
towards
her
house
she
was
so
very
tall
that
she
seemed
as
high
as
the
highest
mountains
astrid
went
to
meet
her
and
invited
her
to
come
to
her
home
after
the
guest
had
seated
herself
she
said
thou
astrid
and
thy
two
sisters
must
be
most
careful
at
the
games
not
to
fall
in
love
with
the
sons
of
a
great
berserk
who
are
coming
to
then
she
saw
twelve
eagles
tearing
the
flesh
of
men
then
the
tall
woman
told
her
to
receive
ivar
and
his
well
after
saying
this
she
rose
and
as
she
was
ready
to
depart
she
said
i
will
continue
to
protect
thee
and
thy
family
now
we
will
separate
for
some
time
fare
thee
thereupon
astrid
awoke
she
was
very
much
concerned
in
regard
to
this
dream
and
went
to
thorhalla
a
woman
who
was
reputed
very
wise
in
the
interpretation
of
dreams
when
she
came
to
her
door
she
said
i
should
like
thee
to
explain
a
dream
which
i
have
thorhalla
said
i
will
not
hear
thy
dream
go
away
as
quickly
as
thou
canst
to
the
house
of
bryngerd
she
will
explain
it
to
astrid
wondered
why
thorhalla
would
not
explain
her
dream
but
she
did
as
she
was
bidden
and
after
walking
quite
a
while
she
came
to
the
house
of
bryngerd
and
told
her
dream
to
her
bryngerd
listened
very
attentively
and
said
to
her
this
forebodes
great
events
the
woman
thou
hast
seen
is
thy
disir
and
has
come
to
forewarn
thee
of
danger
the
twelve
eagles
mean
the
twelve
sons
of
the
berserk
hervard
and
many
valiant
men
will
fall
on
thy
on
her
return
home
astrid
told
of
her
dream
to
her
father
and
to
her
sisters
and
made
preparations
for
a
sacrifice
to
her
disir
or
guardian

a
special

and
his
unaware
of
the
preparations
for
a
sacrifice
that
were
being
made
by
the
three
sisters
wended
their
way
towards
their
bower
just
as
they
were
beginning
to
sacrifice
and
were
ready
to
redden
the
altar
with
blood
as
they
approached
the
house
the
bondmaid
who
was
watching
saw
them
and
went
into
the
hall
to
warn
her
mistresses
that
some
one
was
coming
on
hearing
this
astrid
full
of
alarm
came
out
of
the
door
and
as
she
saw
ivar
and
his
she
exclaimed

not
come
here
for
this
place
is
holy
we
are
making
a
sacrifice
to
our
disirs
do
you
not
fear
the
anger
of
odin
that
you

to

to
us

replied
we
are
not
afraid
to
incur
the
anger
of
odin
fair
maidens
of
svithjod
we
would
brave
it
for
your

went
off
in
another
direction
astrid
returned
to
the
room
and
with
her
sisters
reddened
the
altar
with
the
blood
of
the
sacrificed
animals
and
asked
their
disirs
to
continue
to
watch
over
them

who
had
superb
hair
said
see
how
luxuriously
her
hair
of
gold
glows
against
the
azure
of
the
sky
look
at
her
eyes
they
are
as
the
deep
blue
of
the
sea
we
meet
when
we
are
far
away
from
the
look
at
this
one
said
ivar
pointing
to
him
one
of
the
loveliest
maidens
in
this
bevy
of
beauty
see
her
hair
hanging
on
her
back
and
swaying
in
the
breeze
it
is
the
color
of
a
field
of
wheat
moving
in
the
wind
and
gilded
by
the
rays
of
the
look
at
this
other
one
said
again
hjalmar
her
hair
is
as
black
as
that
of
the
raven
her
eyes
seem
to
send
forth
flashes
of
fire
some
of
the
kin
from
which
she
is
descended
must
have
come
from
the
land
of
the
huns
i
think
she
must
be
from
she
was
unique
among
all
with
her
raven
hair
and
much
admired
on
that
account
for
the
fair
hues
generally
predominated
over
the
dark
sigurd
said
have
you
ever
seen
such
eyes
as
those
that
are
here
together
they
are
like
a
bunch
of
arrows
in
a
quiver
ready
to
be
shot
at
us
poor
mortals
and
to
make
us
feel
the
pangs
of
love
some
of
them
are
dreamy
some
are
twinkling
with
mischief
some
are
piercing
some
are
so
loving
a
few
are
so
fiery
that
one
feels
that
it
is
better
not
to
excite
the
ire
of
the
maiden
who
possesses
them
look
at
their
the
deep
blue
to
the
amethyst
and
greenish
tourmaline
look
at
the
hazel
ones
there
are
but
a
few
of
them
but
oh
how
lovely
and
poetical
they
seem
at
times
to
send
forth
flashes
of
genius
then
to
return
again
gently
to
their
dreamy
mood
well
may
the
eyes
be
called
the
mirror
of
our
thoughts
for
they
tell
of
our
love

these
men
and
many
others
present
were
the
embodiment
of
all
that
was
chivalrous
and
brave
in
the
norselands
many
of
them
had
passed
a
great
part
of
their
lives
at
sea
or
in
foreign
lands
conquering
and
fighting
carrying
their
victorious
standards
before
them
everywhere
their
ruddy
faces
told
that
they
were
the
sons
of
the

had
fought
many
a
time
with
great
skill

daughters
of

tales

could
tell

terrific

encountered
with
their
ships
while
on
their
expeditions
voyaging
on
either
the
north
sea
the
atlantic

almost

could

that
some
of
their
kinsmen
had
gone
to
the

on

way
to

to

superb
specimens
of

they
were
the
finest
the
world
could
show
in
appearance
for
all
the
weak
at
their
birth

not
been
allowed
to
live
what
splendid
proportions
their
bodies
had
what
strong
chests
and
powerful
frames
what
muscles
for
from
their
childhood
these
men
had
been
trained
and
practised
athletic
games
and
all
had
lived
much
in
the
open
air
many
were
tall
but
there
were
also
many
of
medium
height
a
few
were
short
these
were
often
the
hardiest
and
most
agile
and
could
stand
hardships
much
better
than
their
taller
friends
most
of
them
were
fair
but
some

had
dark

and

they
arrived
on

their

a

tight
at

wore

stood
by

near

and
were
to
be
the
umpires
as
soon
as
ivar
and
his
had
arrived
on
the
fields
they
went
to
salute
the

and
all
the
fair

were
their

a

the
compliment
was
appreciated
for

and
his
saluted
yngvi
and
the
other
hersirs
yngvi
asked
ivar
if
he
was
a
man
of
many
athletic
games
ivar
replied
my
thought
i
knew
many
things
well
but
i
have
not
shown
my
skill
to
others
and
i
think
thou
wilt
find
it
slight
when
compared
to
that
of
some
ivar
replied
in
this
way
for
he
remembered
the
advice
which
his
father
had
given
him
that
a
man
with
a
thinking
mind
should
not
boast
but
rather
be
heedful
in
his
mood
and
beware
because
the
tongue
is
the
head
s
bane
then
all
prepared
themselves
for
the
contests
that
were
to
jumping
leaping
running
different
games
of
ball
swimming
and
warlike
exercises
with
spears
swords
bows
and
arrows
chapter

great
feats
of
ivar
and
hjalmar
the
contests
began
with
wrestling
which
was
one
of
the
most
popular
of
the
games
the
simplest
form
of
this
sport
was
for
the
wrestlers
to
take
hold
of
each
other
s
arms
or
waists
as
best
they
could
and
by
the
strength
of
their
arms
endeavor
to
throw
each
other
off
their
feet
the
sviars
and
the
gotlanders
were
pitted
against
each
other
the
former
had
kept
the
championship
for
several
years
and
ivar
and
other
gotlanders
intended
to
wrest
it
from
them
if
they
could
the
competitors
divided
themselves
by
lot
into
two
parties
each
of
which
was
drawn
up
in
a
row
headed
by
its
leader
these
were
to
pair
off
their
men
to
wrestle
in
the
arena
between
the
two
rows
one
after
the
other
ivar
s
side
was
the
weaker
having
two
men
less
so
two
men
were
taken
off
from
the
sviars
side
before
beginning
every
man
threw
off
his
outer
garment
in
order
to
be
more
free
and
agile
and
kept
only
a
slight
covering
the
beholder
could
see
at
a
glance
what
early
gymnastic
and
athletic
training
did
for
the
body
broad
chests
strong
and
muscular
limbs
were
the
chief
characteristics
of
every
man
the
crowd
watched
with
intense
eagerness
the
preliminaries
of
the
contest
men
on
each
side
were
to
take
part
the
contest
was
quite
even
here
a
man
on
the
sviar
side
fell
then
one
on
the
gotlander
side
at
times
the
wrestling
was
very
severe
between
combatants
and
the
spectators
watched
with
great
interest
the
expansion
or
contraction
of
the
muscles
of
the
rivals
the
fourth
man
before
the
last
on
the
sviar
side
had
been
victorious
and
had
thrown
the
last
three
men
but
one
of
the
gotlanders
and
ivar
was
the
only
wrestler
left
so
he
and
his
antagonist
wrestled
for
a
long
time
until
at
last
the
sviar
fell
then
ivar
had
to
wrestle
with
the
three
others
and
threw
them
one
after
the
other
when
a
great
cheer
like
the
sound
of
distant
thunder
greeted
his
victory
and
his
came
to
congratulate
him
with
great
joy
after
this
ivar
and
his
went
to
the
day
meal
and
on
the
way
to
the
hall
sigmund
saw
among
the
bevy
of
young
women
one
that
looked
at
him
intently
she
was
fair
of
face
and
beautiful
to
look
at
she
wore
a
red
dress
ornamented
all
over
with
lace
her
hair
was
flaxen
and
glossy
and
fell
over
her
shoulders
sigmund
asked
who
she
was
and
about
her
family
and
was
told
that
she
was
the
sister
of
thorir
a
hersir
who
ruled
a
large
herad
and
that
her
name
was
thora
hladhönd
which
means
lace
hand
to
sigmund
she
was
the
most
beautiful
woman
on
the
grounds
then
he
went
to
speak
to
her
and
found
that
they
had
met
before
at
a
midwinter
sacrifice
after
their
meal
they
rested
a
while
and
then
went
back
to
the
games
and
looked
on
the
second
day
the
contest
was
to
be
a
more
difficult
form
of
wrestling
which
consisted
in
grappling
and
attacking
according
to
certain
rules
by
systematic
turnings
and
grip
movements
with
arms
and
legs
each
seeking
to
bring
the
other
to
the
ground
ivar
did
not
wish
to
be
recognized
as
he
had
been
the
successful
champion
the
day
before
and
the
weather
being
chilly
he
had
put
on
a
cloak
with
a
hood
which
partly
hid
his
face
among
those
who
took
part
in
the
game
was
a
man
of
very
powerful
frame
of
the
name
of
thorbjörn
he
would
walk
and
look
round
the
crowd
and
any
one
he
wanted
to
take
part
in
the
game
he
seized
by
the
hand
and
pulled
forward
into
the
field
and
one
after
another
these
fell
before
him
to
the
great
amusement
of
the
crowd
when
almost
all
had
wrestled
except
the
strongest
the
people
began
to
ask
themselves
who
should
contend
against
thorbjörn
thorbjörn
himself
was
looking
round
puffed
up
with
pride
thinking
no
one
could
be
stronger
than
he
and
challenged
the
champions
who
had
fought
against
each
other
the
preceding
day
noticing
among
them
a
man
of
large
size
whose
face
he
could
not
clearly
see
on
account
of
a
hood
he
wore
he
came
towards
him
and
took
hold
of
his
hand
at
first
he
pulled
hard
and
then
with
all
his
strength
but
the
man
sat
still
and
could
not
be
moved
then
thorbjörn
said
in
an
angry
voice
no
one
ever
sat
so
firm
before
me
as
thou
dost
who
art
thou
then
pulling
his
hood
down
so
that
his
face
could
be
seen
he
exclaimed
ivar
hjorvardson
and
added
if
thou
wilt
take
part
in
this
contest
with
me
thou
art
a
welcome
i
have
ceased
to
wrestle
answered
ivar
whose
feats
of
the
day
before
thorbjörn
had
not
witnessed
but
there
was
a
time
when
i
enjoyed
wrestling
soon
after
the
contest
between
the
two
began
thorbjörn
rushed
at
ivar
who
stood
firm
without
flinching
and
then
stretched
his
arms
around
the
back
of
thorbjörn
caught
hold
of
his
breeches
lifted
him
off
his
feet
over
his
head
and
threw
him
behind
him
so
that
thorbjörn
s
shoulders
struck
the
ground
with
a
heavy
thud
this
was
a
magnificent
exhibition
of
strength
and
it
was
hailed
by
the
crowd
with
great
acclamations
then
one
of
thorbjörn
s
brothers
called
angul
challenged
ivar
who
said
let
me
rest
a
little
while
and
then
i
will
be
ready
for
this
new
challenger
was
also
of
great
strength
and
each
had
the
better
of
the
other
by
turns
they
fell
twice
together
on
their
knees
they
grasped
each
other
so
tightly
that
both
became
blue
from
the
pressure
but
finally
angul
fell
ivar
had
shown
that
he
was
so
strong
that
the
people
were
eager
to
see
two
champions
attack
him
at
the
same
time
this
was
against
the
rules
but
was
allowed
if
any
contestant
was
willing
to
encounter
such
odds
ivar
said
he
thought
he
could
do
so
in
the
afternoon
after
a
brief
rest
in
the
afternoon
two
champions
who
were
thought
the
strongest
wrestlers
attacked
him
at
the
same
time
they
wrestled
valiantly
but
could
not
throw
ivar
and
after
awhile
both
men
fell
all
the
people
were
greatly
delighted
at
this
spectacle
when
the
wrestlers
stopped
they
thanked
them
for
their
exhibition
and
it
was
the
opinion
of
all
that
ivar
s
two
opponents
together
were
not
as
strong
as
he
so
ivar
was
proclaimed
the
champion
in
wrestling
that
evening
the
scalds
sang
before
an
admiring
crowd
the
deeds
of
great
warriors
and
every
one
present
was
dressed
in
his
best
attire
the
games
of
ball
were
by
far
the
most
popular
of
all
they
were
to
last
two
days
for
there
were
so
many
competitors
there
were
three
kinds
of
ball
games
called
knattleik
soppleik
and
skofuleik
respectively
this
last
game
was
a
winter
one
and
was
played
on
the
ice
week
after
week
by
the
people
of
a
single
herad
and
was
a
source
of
great
amusement
all
these
games
were
considered
more
or
less
dangerous
as
the
balls
were
of
wood
or
of
scraped
horn
enclosed
in
leather
and
were
sent
back
with
tremendous
force
by
the
bat
hord
a
great
from
the
island
of
zeeland
had
sent
a
challenge
to
the
men
of
gotland
to
compete
for
the
championship
men
of
equal
strength
were
chosen
on
both
sides
so
that
the
chances
might
be
even
the
game
was
played
in
this
way
a
man
threw
the
ball
into
the
air
and
then
struck
it
with
a
bat
sending
it
a
long
distance
another
caught
it
with
his
hands
and
sent
it
back
but
this
the
opposite
side
sought
to
prevent
by
shoving
him
aside
or
by
throwing
him
down
or
striking
the
ball
away
from
him
if
the
ball
went
beyond
the
bounds
or
fell
on
the
ground
the
man
who
had
knocked
it
had
to
go
and
fetch
it
hjalmar
was
a
great
and
wherever
he
had
competed
for
the
championship
in
ball
games
he
had
been
victorious
it
was
generally
conceded
that
he
was
the
best
player
in
engel
hord
was
considered
the
best
in
zeeland
he
was
very
popular
and
a
very
strong
man
the
contest
began
very
eagerly
both
sides
had
ten
men
each
and
were
very
jealous
of
each
other
and
the
game
became
very
rough
the
gotlanders
won
the
victory
but
four
men
of
zeeland
and
three
men
of
gotland
had
been
badly
hurt
in
the
contest
other
games
of
ball
were
taking
place
in
different
parts
of
the
field
at
the
same
time
the
fourth
day
the
crowd
seemed
greater
than
ever
and
many
other
men
wanted
to
play
among
these
were
two
unknown
men
who
came
to
yngvi
and
after
saluting
him
said
their
names
were
hrafn
and
krak
and
they
hailed
from
the
island
of
bornholm
they
boasted
that
no
one
could
play
better
than
they
did
after
hearing
their
boasting
many
invited
them
to
play
they
said
that
they
were
rather
players
but
that
they
could
not
help
it
for
they
were
strong
men
the
champions
of
yngvi
said
that
they
did
not
mind
that
and
would
take
care
of
themselves
whatever
might
happen
the
two
brothers
went
to
the
games
and
generally
had
the
ball
they
played
very
savagely
as
they
had
said
and
pushed
men
and
knocked
them
down
roughly
so
that
when
the
evening
came
many
were
bruised
or
maimed
the
following
morning
sigurd
prevailed
upon
sigmund
to
play
with
him
against
them
hrafn
and
krak
were
already
in
the
fields
challenging
hrafn
took
the
ball
and
krak
the
bat
and
they
played
as
they
were
wont
when
they
had
played
for
a
while
sigurd
got
hold
of
the
ball
from
hrafn
and
then
snatched
the
bat
from
krak
and
sent
it
to
sigmund
they
kept
the
ball
for
a
long
time
and
hrafn
and
krak
could
not
get
hold
of
it
so
sigurd
and
sigmund
were
victorious
and
they
kept
the
championship
to
the
end
of
the
games
at
which
yngvi
astrid
her
sisters
and
a
bevy
of
maidens
were
constantly
present
the
running
games
were
of
two
kinds
men
running
against
fast
horses
or
against
each
other
in
this
game
there
were
many
competitors
the
fleetest
horses
in
upsalir
or
rather
in
svithjod
had
been
picked
out
for
the
contest
men
who
competed
were
dressed
in
tights
only
hjalmar
who
was
one
of
the
fleetest
men
known
was
to
run
against
the
fleetest
horse
when
the
signal
to
start
came
he
started
with
the
horse
and
though
the
animal
kept
abreast
of
him
nearly
all
the
time
he
finally
reached
the
starting
point
somewhat
ahead
one
of
the
spectators
was
so
surprised
at
hjalmar
s
feat
that
he
said
to
him
didst
thou
not
hold
the
strap
of
the
and
let
the
horse
pull
thee
along
not
in
the
least
replied
ivar
hotly
indignant
at
the
distrust
expressed
of
his
yngvi
had
a
very
fast
horse
which
was
next
entered
against
hjalmar
the
two
started
together
and
hjalmar
ran
ahead
of
the
horse
the
whole
way
when
the
race
was
finished
hjalmar
said
did
i
this
time
take
hold
of
the
i
think
thou
didst
start
first
replied
the
umpire
the
horse
was
allowed
to
breathe
a
while
then
his
rider
pricked
him
with
his
spurs
and
he
sprang
off
anew
this
time
hjalmar
stood
still
until
the
umpire
shouted
run
then
hjalmar
himself
started
and
soon
outran
the
horse
and
kept
far
in
front
of
it
all
the
way
to
the
starting
point
of
the
course
which
he
reached
long
in
advance
the
vast
multitude
loudly
applauded
hjalmar
and
as
he
passed
in
front
of
the
daughters
of
yngvi
and
the
bevy
of
young
women
they
too
cheered
him
and
he
bowed
gallantly
to
them
astrid
had
been
watching
him
since
the
games
had
begun
and
admired
him
much
and
as
he
passed
by
her
she
shouted
well
done
hjalmar
gudbrandson
of
she
had
hardly
said
these
words
when
her
face
became
crimson
and
she
wished
she
had
been
able
to
restrain
herself
then
all
the
men
that
had
run
faster
than
the
horses
came
and
competed
for
the
championship
hjalmar
ran
so
fast
that
his
feet
did
not
seem
to
touch
the
ground
he
distanced
all
his
competitors
and
was
proclaimed
the
champion
runner
to
the
great
joy
of
astrid
who
already
loved
him
though
she
was
only
half
conscious
of
the
fact
the
two
following
days
were
to
be
devoted
to
warlike
exercises
and
the
next
morning
yngvi
asked
ivar
art
thou
skilful
in
warlike
exercise
ivar
replied
in
his
usual
modest
way
my
and
my
thought
so
but
i
have
not
shown
my
skill
to
others
and
i
think
thou
wilt
find
it
slight
compared
with
that
of
many
men
i
have
now
won
several
championships
since
the
games
have
begun
but
i
do
not
think
i
shall
be
the
foremost
in
warlike
games
for
it
would
be
strange
if
my
luck
was
to
continue
nevertheless
i
will
strive
for
the
championship
and
do
my
then
ulf
a
great
viking
who
was
said
to
be
the
best
shot
with
the
bow
and
arrow
in
all
norway
came
up
to
ivar
and
said
to
him
let
us
try
our
skill
thou
art
younger
than
i
but
i
hear
thou
art
very
skilful
with
the
upon
this
ulf
took
a
spear
and
put
its
point
into
the
ground
then
he
placed
an
arrow
on
the
string
and
shot
into
the
air
the
arrow
turned
itself
in
its
course
came
down
with
its
point
in
the
end
of
the
and
stood
there
upright
ivar
next
took
an
arrow
and
shot
it
went
very
high
then
the
came
down
into
the
shaft
of
the
arrow
of
ulf
that
had
stuck
on
the
shaft
of
the
spear
then
ulf
took
a
spear
and
threw
it
so
powerfully
and
so
far
and
nevertheless
so
straight
that
all
wondered
but
ivar
threw
still
farther
than
all
so
that
his
spear
socket
lay
on
the
point
of
ulf
s
spear
ulf
took
the
spear
again
and
shot
another
time
and
the
spear
went
beyond
that
of
ivar
s
i
will
not
throw
any
more
for
i
see
it
is
useless
said
ivar
throw
said
ulf
and
farther
if
thou
ivar
threw
and
this
time
far
ahead
after
this
ulf
placed
an
arrow
on
the
and
took
a
knife
and
stuck
it
into
an
oak
he
then
shot
into
the
back
of
the
so
that
the
arrow
stuck
fast
ivar
next
took
up
his
arrows
while
ulf
stood
near
him
and
said
with
gold
are
thy
arrows
wound
round
and
a
very
ambitious
man
art
i
did
not
cause
these
arrows
to
be
made
they
were
given
to
me
and
i
have
not
taken
any
ornaments
off
them
returned
ivar
shooting
and
hitting
the
and
splitting
it
the
sticking
in
the
upper
point
of
the
blade
now
we
will
shoot
farther
said
ulf
then
he
laid
an
arrow
on
the
string
and
drew
the
bow
so
as
to
almost
bend
its
tips
together
the
arrow
flew
very
far
and
stopped
in
a
very
slender
bough
at
which
he
had
aimed
every
one
thought
this
a
most
excellent
shot
but
ivar
shot
still
a
little
farther
and
besides
his
arrow
pierced
a
nut
that
had
been
put
up
as
a
target
all
present
wondered
at
this
now
the
nut
shall
be
taken
and
placed
on
the
head
of
björn
said
ulf
and
there
thou
shalt
try
if
thou
canst
hit
it
if
thou
art
willing
to
do
so
thou
shalt
not
shoot
from
a
shorter
distance
than
before
björn
is
my
slave
and
for
his
boldness
and
willingness
i
will
give
him
his
freedom
after
the
trial
if
his
life
is
björn
was
delighted
and
willing
to
risk
his
life
for
his
freedom
for
where
is
the
man
that
does
not
love
to
be
free
wilt
thou
stand
still
and
not
shrink
if
i
shoot
at
the
nut
asked
ivar
certainly
said
björn
who
had
witnessed
the
skill
of
ivar
and
therefore
had
great
confidence
in
his
aim
then
ulf
shall
stand
at
thy
side
replied
ivar
and
see
if
i
hit
the
ulf
assented
and
ivar
made
ready
and
took
aim
the
arrow
flew
swiftly
and
skipped
over
the
crown
of
björn
s
head
and
under
the
nut
and
björn
was
not
wounded
the
nut
rolled
backward
from
his
head
but
the
arrow
went
much
farther
when
yngvi
asked
if
the
shot
had
hit
the
nut
ulf
replied
better
than
hit
for
he
shot
under
the
nut
and
it
rolled
down
and
he
harmed
not
this
extraordinary
feat
of
ivar
was
greatly
applauded
and
by
none
more
than
by
randalin
björn
the
slave
was
made
free
after
this
ivar
took
his
sword
and
handled
it
equally
well
with
the
right
and
the
left
hand
and
moved
it
so
swiftly
that
it
seemed
as
if
there
were
three
swords
in
the
air
at
a
time
then
he
threw
his
sword
high
up
caught
it
with
his
left
hand
having
the
shield
in
his
right
hand
and
dealt
a
terrific
blow
upon
a
shield
which
a
man
held
for
the
purpose
before
the
people
could
see
what
he
was
about
to
do
the
enthusiasm
of
randalin
was
unbounded
when
she
saw
the
great
skill
of
ivar
then
came
the
leaping
games
many
leaped
as
well
backward
as
forward
more
than
their
height
in
full
war
apparel
and
the
championship
was
undecided
when
ivar
came
forward
in
full
war
dress
with
helmet
sword
and
shield
and
leaped
far
above
his
height
which
was
nearly
six
feet
and
then
leaped
backward
quite
as
high
as
he
had
done
forward
this
feat
was
cheered
tumultuously
and
all
agreed
that
to
ivar
should
be
awarded
the
championship
on
the
last
day
of
the
games
the
twelve
sons
of
the
powerful
and
famous
berserk
hervard
appeared
on
the
scene
of
the
contest
for
the
championship
in
swimming
thorgrim
was
the
eldest
the
second
gisli
the
third
bui
the
fourth
seming
the
fifth
hadding
the
sixth
thorolf
the
seventh
brani
the
eighth
angantyr
the
ninth
ketil
the
tenth
grim
the
eleventh
barri
the
twelfth
asbjörn
all
these
brothers
were
equal
in
strength
and
skill
with
the
exception
of
thorgrim
who
was
much
the
strongest
they
were
all
great
berserks
and
had
inherited
all
the
warlike
qualities
of
their
father
and
kin
and
most
of
them
had
also
the
same
temper
they
had
all
gone
into
battle
before
they
were
fifteen
years
old
and
since
had
ravaged
far
and
wide
and
had
met
no
equal
in
strength
and
courage
they
had
won
great
renown
for
never
did
they
engage
in
battle
without
gaining
the
victory
these
twelve
brothers
always
went
together
in
one
ship
with
no
other
champion
on
board
but
often
they
had
a
great
following
of
ships
and
men
their
father
who
had
been
a
very
great
warrior
had
given
them
many
excellent
swords
which
he
had
taken
in
war
thorgrim
had
the
sword
mistletoe
gisli
the
sword
thegn
bui
the
sword
rangvid
and
all
the
other
brothers
had
swords
equally
good
and
celebrated
among
vikings
besides
these
they
had
other
excellent
dueling
swords
they
went
on
warlike
expeditions
during
the
summer
but
during
the
winter
they
remained
at
home
with
their
father
it
happened
that
the
preceding
yule
all
these
brothers
were
at
home
and
on
the
evening
that
the
men
were
to
make
vows
over
the
horn
of
bragi
they
came
into
the
hall
of
their
father
and
after
many
vows
had
been
made
they
made
theirs
bui
made
the
vow
that
he
would
marry
astrid
the
eldest
daughter
of
yngvi
the
hersir
of
svithjod
and
never
allow
any
one
to
possess
her
in
case
her
father
or
herself
should
refuse
him
his
eleven
brothers
vowed
that
they
would
stand
by
him
they
had
come
to
take
part
in
the
games
and
to
win
championships
after
which
they
intended
to
ask
for
the
hand
of
astrid
at
the
feast
which
was
always
given
at
the
conclusion
of
the
games
the
brothers
had
noticed
with
no
little
jealousy
that
astrid
and
hjalmar
seemed
to
love
each
other
but
no
one
knew
of
their
errand
for
they
had
kept
it
secret
they
had
resolved
to
try
to
drown
hjalmar
in
the
swimming
contests
yngvi
and
all
women
and
men
of
the
land
were
present
when
the
swimming
began
among
the
most
remarkable
swimmers
was
a
man
of
the
name
of
olvir
who
went
to
ivar
and
said
to
him
what
thinkest
thou
of
our
having
a
swimming
match
i
think
well
of
it
replied
ivar
for
i
am
told
that
thou
and
i
are
about
equal
as
ivar
and
olvir
swam
off
and
played
a
long
time
with
each
other
alternately
dragging
each
other
down
and
finally
they
were
so
long
under
water
that
the
spectators
did
not
expect
them
ever
to
come
up
again
but
at
last
olvir
rose
and
swam
ashore
he
went
up
and
rested
himself
but
did
not
dress
no
one
knew
or
dared
to
ask
what
had
become
of
ivar
but
after
a
still
longer
time
he
too
appeared
above
the
surface
he
had
caught
a
very
large
seal
and
sat
on
its
back
he
clung
to
it
with
both
hands
by
its
bristles
and
thus
steered
it
and
when
he
came
near
the
shore
let
it
go
why
didst
not
thou
kill
the
seal
with
the
knife
thou
didst
carry
in
thy
belt
asked
many
people
because
answered
ivar
if
i
had
done
so
olvir
or
those
who
witnessed
our
contest
would
have
said
that
i
had
found
it
though
olvir
had
been
the
first
to
come
ashore
while
ivar
had
taken
time
to
capture
the
seal
it
was
decided
by
the
umpires
that
the
best
swimmer
of
the
two
was
ivar
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
all
the
maidens
and
women
that
were
present
and
of
all
his
male
friends
as
well
but
none
was
as
pleased
as
randalin
then
came
the
contest
in
swimming
clad
in
full
war
dress
not
many
dared
to
try
this
contest
hjalmar
took
his
helmet
and
sword
wrapped
them
in
his
cloak
making
a
bundle
of
them
which
he
tied
on
his
back
then
he
broke
off
his
spear
handle
and
threw
it
far
off
into
the
water
and
swam
towards
the
broken
handle
he
caught
it
then
swam
farther
to
an
island
far
away
no
one
swam
as
far
as
he
so
he
won
the
championship
that
morning
to
the
great
delight
of
astrid
after
the
day
s
meal
and
the
drinking
hour
were
over
thorgrim
the
eldest
son
of
hervard
called
his
brothers
and
they
went
down
to
the
shore
and
thorgrim
said
to
gisli
i
trust
to
thee
to
drown
hjalmar
while
competing
with
him
gisli
answered
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
do
so
and
then
thorgrim
asked
bui
to
undertake
it
bui
replied
that
he
was
doubtful
of
success
but
consented
to
try
then
bui
went
to
challenge
hjalmar
and
hjalmar
accepted
saying
to
himself
now
i
need
not
spare
myself
as
i
should
like
better
to
contend
with
him
than
with
any
other
of
these
bui
asked
if
they
should
try
a
long
swimming
match
we
may
do
so
replied
hjalmar
as
thou
mayest
have
the
better
of
it
in
the
other
modes
of
when
they
had
been
swimming
for
a
long
time
bui
seemed
anxious
to
go
back
but
hjalmar
kept
on
bui
swam
somewhat
more
slowly
and
asked
shortly
after
art
thou
to
swim
longer
i
think
thou
wilt
be
able
to
swim
alone
towards
the
shore
replied
hjalmar
i
will
swim
very
well
said
bui
i
will
risk
going
back
and
he
turned
but
had
not
gone
far
before
he
became
exhausted
hjalmar
swam
to
him
and
asked
how
it
went
with
him
but
bui
s
pride
prevented
him
from
acknowledging
his
weakness
and
he
told
him
he
might
go
his
way
hjalmar
replied
i
think
thou
deservest
that
we
both
go
together
for
i
do
not
want
thee
to
be
drowned
lay
thy
hands
on
my
back
and
thus
support
thyself
and
in
this
way
they
came
to
land
bui
walked
up
the
bank
but
had
become
quite
exhausted
hjalmar
sat
down
upon
a
boulder
at
the
mark
of
high
water
thorgrim
asked
his
brother
how
he
felt
bui
answered
i
should
not
be
able
to
tell
if
hjalmar
had
not
been
a
good
and
generous
now
ketil
said
thorgrim
unmoved
by
hearing
of
this
chivalrous
conduct
thou
shalt
try
to
drown
i
will
not
try
answered
his
brother
for
it
seems
to
me
that
bui
who
has
tried
the
swimming
has
won
little
glory
and
that
all
the
fame
of
the
contest
has
gone
to
then
thorgrim
himself
challenged
hjalmar
and
threw
off
his
clothes
hjalmar
rose
from
his
stone
and
went
into
the
water
with
thorgrim
and
as
soon
as
they
met
thorgrim
thrust
him
down
into
the
deep
no
one
on
shore
could
see
what
they
were
doing
for
they
were
both
far
under
water
though
the
sea
boiled
above
them
after
a
while
it
became
quiet
and
thorgrim
swam
ashore
ivar
and
his
two
other
began
to
feel
very
anxious
as
hjalmar
was
not
seen
any
more
they
thought
thorgrim
had
drowned
him
and
they
swore
to
avenge
him
astrid
fainted
on
her
seat
and
there
was
great
sorrow
among
the
women
maidens
and
men
that
had
seen
the
contest
and
many
friends
mourned
the
death
of
hjalmar
who
they
thought
had
surely
gone
to
the
hall
of
ran
without
being
prepared
to
appear
there
as
befitted
his
rank
there
was
little
merriment
over
the
beer
in
the
hall
that
evening
yngvi
was
overcome
with
anger
for
if
thorgrim
had
drowned
hjalmar
by
hurting
him
it
was
murder
but
thorgrim
declared
that
if
hjalmar
was
drowned
it
was
from
exhaustion
and
he
was
ready
to
take
his
oath
on
the
temple
ring
that
he
was
innocent
of
any
foul
deed
lights
were
kindled
and
the
second
high
seat
reserved
for
hjalmar
was
empty
suddenly
the
door
of
the
hall
opened
hjalmar
entered
greeted
by
great
shouts
of
joy
and
advancing
towards
the
seat
of
thorgrim
he
placed
on
his
knee
the
knife
thorgrim
had
worn
in
his
belt
when
swimming
then
everybody
knew
that
thorgrim
had
carried
a
knife
which
hjalmar
had
taken
from
him
and
yet
had
spared
his
life
hjalmar
had
swum
under
water
for
a
while
and
landed
the
other
side
of
a
small
island
where
nobody
could
see
him
from
the
shore
after
a
time
hearing
the
good
news
of
hjalmar
s
safety
astrid
entered
the
hall
followed
by
her
sisters
and
girl
friends
with
a
golden
horn
in
her
hand
she
paused
before
hjalmar
and
said
hail
to
thee
noble
hjalmar
thrice
hail
to
thee
on
account
of
the
danger
thou
hast
escaped
and
then
seated
herself
by
his
side
and
with
a
frowning
look
eyed
the
twelve
sons
of
hervard
these
were
more
angry
than
ever
against
hjalmar
and
bore
him
no
good
will
but
nothing
could
be
seen
of
this
in
their
countenances
the
hall
became
full
of
clatter
and
cheer
the
beer
was
drunk
freely
all
felt
happy
that
hjalmar
had
not
lost
his
life
the
only
unhappy
ones
were
the
twelve
brothers
who
nevertheless
tried
to
appear
merry
chapter
xxvii
the
fall
in
love
the
meeting
of
so
many
people
at
the
games
played
havoc
with
the
hearts
of
many
a
maiden
and
many
a
warrior
who
had
come
to
upsalir
tales
of
love
had
been
whispered
in
the
ears
of
many
trusting
and
confiding
viking
daughters
and
many
had
sworn
to
love
each
other
until
death
vikings
who
lived
far
away
or
in
distant
lands
had
promised
to
come
with
their
ships
and
visit
the
fair
ones
who
had
inspired
them
with
admiration
and
love
of
course
they
were
coming
to
see
their
fathers
and
mothers
or
their
kinsmen
with
whom
they
had
become
friends
these
brave
warriors
and
doughty
champions
deluded
themselves
as
men
often
do
on
such
occasions
with
the
idea
that
the
people
would
not
understand
that
their
object
in
coming
was
to
see
the
daughters
instead
of
their
fathers
mothers
or
kinsmen
it
is
true
that
some
men
had
become
fast
friends
and
had
sworn
to
each
other
during
the
games
the
time
was
near
at
hand
when
the
lovers
were
to
part
sleepless
nights
told
of
the
anguish
many
felt
at
the
thought
of
going
away
and
no
wonder
for
how
many
had
felt
love
budding
for
the
first
time
what
delightful
days
had
just
been
passed
what
new
friends
many
had
made
how
many
old
friendships
had
been
renewed
how
many
beloved
faces
had
been
seen
again
after
years
of
separation
how
many
slumbering
loves
had
awakened
but
the
games
were
also
to
leave
many
there
had
been
broken
friendships
between
men
or
women
who
had
been
fast
friends
before
for
if
there
is
one
thing
in
the
world
that
the
friendship
of
two
men
can
not
support
even
if
they
are
brothers
it
is
for
both
to
love
the
same
woman
and
it
is
the
same
with
two
women
even
if
they
are
sisters
who
love
the
same
man
envy
and
hatred
are
sure
to
follow
for
love
can
not
be
shared
many
had
also
taken
an
oath
beforehand
that
they
would
marry
such
or
such
a
girl
or
challenge
their
successful
rival
to
mortal
combat
and
many
a
duel
was
to
take
place
on
that
account
for
it
had
happened
that
the
maidens
they
admired
had
not
always
reciprocated
their
feelings
and
indeed
loved
some
one
else
better
one
evening
the
did
not
go
to
the
hall
and
were
together
in
their
house
and
for
quite
a
while
had
not
uttered
a
single
word
when
suddenly
the
silence
was
broken
by
sigurd
who
said
to
ivar
thou
seemest
to
be
in
a
meditative
mood
what
dost
thou
think
on
i
was
thinking
replied
ivar
of
and
he
continued
love
was
born
in
the
beginning
of
all
things
and
came
with
the
world

and
were
made
one
the
pollen
of
a
flower
wanders
in
the
air
over

and

kiss
another
flower
and
say
i

men
and
women
were
born
out
of
love
and
both
wander
in
the
world
until
they
meet
their
mates
for
love
is
part
of
their
own
being
life
without
love
might
as
well
never
have
yes
exclaimed
hjalmar
to
us
men
woman
is
the
incarnation
of
love
of
all
that
is
sweet
and
beautiful
in
life
to
us
she
is
the
most
sublime
conception
of
the
creative
power
of
the
he
was
thinking
of
astrid
when
he
uttered
these
sentiments
we
forget
odin
for
the
woman
we
love
for
her
we
would
give
our
last
drop
of
blood
we
would
die
before
her
eyes
that
she
might
see
our
manliness
and
bravery
and
learn
that
we
are
worthy
of
her
then
with
great
animation
he
exclaimed
o
love
embrace
me
with
thy
giant
s
strength
and
stay
with
me
until
my
life
ebbs
away
bring
thy
vivifying
breath
close
to
my
lips
until
thou
becomest
part
of
my
own
being
for
i
care
not
to
live
without
thee
when
mother
earth
who
has
fed
me
and
loved
me
so
tenderly
folds
me
within
her
embrace
and
hides
from
me
forever
the
light
of
the
sun
and
of
this
beautiful
world
which
i
have
loved
so
much
o
love
envelop
me
with
thy
immortality
thou
must
surely
be
in
love
exclaimed
the
three
to
utter
the
sentiments
thou
hast
just
the
fact
is
said
sigurd
that
love
is
lurking
in
the
heart
of
you
all
my
that
is
true
they
shouted
with
one
voice
and
began
to
exchange
confidences
ivar
spoke
first
and
declared
that
he
loved
randalin
yngvi
s
second
daughter
to
distraction
when
she
speaks
he
added
her
voice
sounds
to
me
as
the
softest
tones
of
the
harp
from
her
lips
come
the
scented
perfume
of
the
roses
of
the
caspian
or
of
the
flowers
of
our
own
then
in
a
fit
of
enthusiasm
he
said
with
great
earnestness
i
tell
you
that
honey
is
sour
compared
with
the
sweetness
of
a
merry
laugh
of
approbation
greeted
ivar
s
last
sentence
then
hjalmar
said
i
love
astrid
the
eldest
daughter
of
the
hersir
of
svithjod
and
the
goddess
sjofn
has
turned
her
mind
and
mine
to
mutual
love
and
i
have
taken
an
oath
that
no
one
shall
marry
her
unless
i
fall
by
his
we
will
stand
by
thee
hjalmar
shouted
again
all
the
sigmund
declared
that
he
loved
solveig
the
fair
so
called
on
account
of
her
beauty
solveig
was
very
retiring
and
bashful
but
her
dignified
manner
and
charms
had
not
escaped
sigmund
she
was
the
daughter
of
björn
hersir
who
ruled
over
a
large
herad
and
resided
at
gaular
close
by
the
temple
the
had
met
her
there
at
an
autumn
sacrifice
at
which
they
were
present
and
at
that
time
sigmund
fell
in
love
with
her
and
now
that
they
had
met
again
at
upsalir
he
was
more
desperately
in
love
than
ever
i
knew
said
ivar
addressing
himself
to
hjalmar
that
thou
wast
in
love
with
astrid
and
that
she
loved
thee
for
in
a
hundred
ways
that
passed
unnoticed
to
others
i
saw
that
she
showed
her
preference
for
thee
over
all
her
other
suitors
the
ancient
saying
proves
true
he
added
the
eyes
can
not
hide
it
if
a
woman
loves
a
man
or
if
a
man
loves
a
hjalmar
replied
ivar
i
can
say
the
same
thing
of
thee
we
thy
three
saw
how
much
thou
and
randalin
were
in
love
with
each
other
as
for
thee
sigmund
said
he
laughing
this
saying
proves
true
in
regard
to
thee
many
a
man
acts
strangely
when
in
love
but
blame
not
man
for
that
blame
love
dear
sigurd
said
all
the
at
once
thou
hast
said
nothing
to
us
yet
about
the
maiden
thou
lovest
and
thou
art
our
elder
and
we
know
that
no
one
has
a
greater
admiration
and
regard
for
women
than
thou
hast
nor
loves
their
society
more
than
thou
i
have
wandered
as
you
know
more
than
any
of
you
returned
sigurd
in
our
and
many
other
lands
and
have
not
yet
seen
the
maiden
of
my
destiny
i
have
never
met
her
whom
i
wanted
to
marry
once
or
twice
in
my
life
if
nothing
had
happened
to
prevent
me
from
meeting
again
the
maiden
i
had
begun
to
love
i
should
have
probably
been
married
but
the
nornir
have
not
shaped
my
life
thus
far
for
me
to
be
passionately
in
love
we
must
wait
for
time
and
for
their
after
hearing
his
words
the
said
sigurd
marry
for
thou
art
the
only
one
left
of
thy
kin
and
it
is
not
wise
for
a
man
to
die
and
leave
no
scion
to
inherit
his
virtues
and
his
after
this
talk
each
went
his
own
way
and
ivar
without
taking
notice
of
it
walked
unconsciously
towards
the
bower
of
randalin
and
saw
her
coming
towards
him
on
her
way
to
the
house
of
her
father
a
thrill
of
joy
ran
through
him
as
he
perceived
her
she
turned
pale
and
red
alternately
at
seeing
him
she
was
ready
to
sink
to
the
ground
an
indescribable
feeling
told
her
that
ivar
was
about
to
propose
to
her
the
that
followed
her
fell
back
and
ivar
and
she
walked
on
together
after
a
little
pause
ivar
said
to
her
thou
knowest
randalin
that
the
goddess
var
listens
to
the
oaths
of
men
and
to
the
private
engagements
which
men
and
women
make
between
themselves
in
regard
to
love
and
punishes
those
who
break
them
i
want
her
to
hear
me
and
to
listen
to
what
thou
hast
to
say
to
then
looking
at
her
intently
he
continued
rememberest
thou
fairest
of
maidens
the
day
when
we
met
for
the
first
time
yes
replied
the
daughter
of
yngvi
i
remember
it
as
if
it
were
canst
thou
recollect
continued
ivar
how
we
looked
at
each
other
as
soon
as
we
met
and
how
our
eyes
seemed
to
melt
into
each
other
s
at
that
time
an
indescribable
feeling
seized
me
thou
didst
seem
to
entrance
me
i
felt
as
i
never
felt
before
in
my
life
i
loved
thee
and
i
thought
that
thou
also
didst
love
me
and
when
thou
didst
continue
thy
way
my
eyes
were
riveted
upon
thy
fair
form
and
i
remember
that
before
thou
didst
disappear
thou
didst
turn
thy
head
once
more
towards
me
as
if
some
magic
impulse
compelled
thee
to
do
so
and
told
thee
that
i
was
still
at
thy
sight
we
gave
to
each
other
a
farewell
look
as
if
to
say
yes
we
will
meet
i
remember
all
that
well
said
randalin
for
her
honest
heart
could
not
deny
it
since
then
said
ivar
i
have
thought
of
thee
by
day
and
often
dreamt
of
thee
by
night
and
now
i
feel
that
before
i
return
to
dampstadir
i
must
tell
thee
of
my
love
and
ask
thee
if
thou
wilt
give
me
thy
heart
and
marry
me
if
thou
sayest
no
life
then
will
have
no
more
charm
for
me
the
clatter
of
weapons
on
the
field
of
battle
will
no
more
sound
pleasantly
in
my
ears
ambition
for
renowned
deeds
will
never
stir
me
more
i
feel
that
without
thee
i
could
not
randalin
s
feelings
as
she
heard
the
burning
words
from
ivar
s
lips
were
such
that
she
could
not
speak
taking
his
hands
and
looking
with
her
beautiful
blue
eyes
into
his
face
she
said
ivar
thy
wife
i
will
be
and
no
other
man
shall
ever
possess
in
the
evening
the
met
as
was
their
custom
to
talk
matters
over
before
they
went
to
the
banqueting
hall
to
drink
with
the
men
and
champions
of
the
land
all
agreed
that
they
should
ask
the
parents
of
the
young
girls
for
their
consent
to
the
different
marriages
for
the
laws
regarding
marriage
were
very
strict
and
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
in
which
vikings
were
more
particular
or
more
revengeful
if
the
honor
of
one
of
their
kinswomen
was
attacked
chapter
xxviii
betrothal
of
ivar
and
randalin
the
next
morning
ivar
went
to
see
two
of
his
uncles
randvir
a
brother
of
his
mother
and
visbur
a
brother
of
his
father
who
had
come
to
upsalir
with
him
and
said
to
them
kinsmen
i
desire
you
to
ask
for
me
in
marriage
randalin
the
second
daughter
of
yngvi
the
hersir
of
well
done
ivar
said
his
two
uncles
with
one
voice
thou
art
wise
in
thy
choice
for
randalin
is
beautiful
and
most
accomplished
in
all
that
pertains
to
woman
and
will
be
a
wife
worthy
of
thee
she
is
one
of
the
greatest
matches
in
the
northern
lands
and
we
hope
sincerely
that
both
her
father
and
herself
will
consent
to
your
i
have
told
randalin
how
much
i
loved
her
and
she
has
said
that
no
one
shall
ever
marry
her
but
me
replied
ivar
the
same
afternoon
the
two
uncles
of
ivar
went
to
yngvi
and
said
to
him
kinsman
we
have
to
talk
to
thee
on
a
very
important
matter
and
then
explained
their
errand
visbur
was
the
spokesman
and
said
we
are
allied
to
thee
by
blood
and
kinship
and
we
wish
furthermore
to
cement
more
closely
our
friendship
so
we
have
come
to
ask
the
hand
of
thy
second
daughter
randalin
for
ivar
thy
daughter
is
and
of
all
the
pedigrees
of
the
upsalir
families
hers
is
the
highest
for
she
is
descended
in
direct
line
from
the
gods
themselves
we
wish
if
it
is
thy
pleasure
that
ivar
should
be
thy
after
a
pause
in
order
to
allow
yngvi
to
reflect
upon
his
proposals
visbur
continued
ivar
is
valiant
has
been
in
many
battles
has
travelled
far
and
wide
and
is
we
think
very
wise
for
his
age
more
than
all
this
ivar
loves
thy
daughter
randalin
and
we
think
it
will
be
a
happy
union
for
both
our
families
and
will
cement
the
friendship
that
exists
between
gotland
and
yngvi
received
their
request
favorably
and
replied
i
know
that
there
will
be
no
disparity
in
the
match
for
both
ivar
and
randalin
are
of
odin
s
kin
ivar
is
a
renowned
warrior
and
rules
over
one
of
the
powerful
realms
of
the
north
there
is
no
obstacle
to
their
marriage
for
though
they
are
related
by
blood
it
is
only
in
the
fifth
degree
and
this
is
the
degree
in
which
marriage
is
allowed
between
kinsmen
and
kinswomen
this
is
one
of
our
wisest
laws
which
has
been
adhered
to
by
us
norsemen
from
the
most
ancient
times
by
this
we
prevent
the
degeneration
of
our
but
continued
yngvi
randalin
is
wise
and
i
will
not
betroth
her
to
any
one
without
her
consent
besides
she
is
of
age
according
to
law
since
she
is
over
fifteen
and
as
she
owns
entailed
lands
in
her
own
right
she
can
betroth
herself
to
whom
she
likes
though
it
would
be
very
unwise
for
her
to
do
so
without
my
consent
but
before
i
speak
to
her
on
the
subject
we
must
find
that
we
are
of
one
mind
in
regard
to
the
conditions
of
the
marriage
concerning
property
you
are
aware
that
randalin
has
even
a
great
deal
of
property
in
her
own
right
and
that
she
owns
a
third
of
her
mother
s
inheritance
which
includes
many
large
landed
estates
and
that
in
the
course
of
time
a
great
deal
of
wealth
is
to
come
to
her
marriage
is
a
civil
contract
owing
to
the
relation
which
man
and
wife
hold
towards
each
other
in
regard
to
property
let
us
see
what
will
be
the
dowry
or
home
following
and
the
counter
dowry
if
we
agree
on
these
points
i
see
not
what
should
prevent
the
marriage
if
randalin
is
willing
her
brothers
are
waging
war
in
the
mediterranean
and
they
will
be
delighted
to
hear
of
their
sister
s
marriage
with
their
comrade
and
remote
kinsman
ivar
then
he
added
according
to
the
laws
of
our
land
a
woman
has
to
be
provided
with
a
dowry
otherwise
her
children
are
not
inheritance
born
and
no
marriage
is
valid
without
dowry
and
that
dowry
and
the
counter
dowry
which
we
give
her
belong
to
her
for
life
and
afterwards
to
her
children
or
to
whomsoever
she
wills
them
and
her
husband
must
not
touch
them
if
she
dies
childless
her
estates
go
back
to
her
kinsmen
but
the
dowry
is
then
returned
to
her
husband
and
she
is
entitled
to
a
third
of
the
property
both
personal
and
real
earned
by
her
husband
during
their
married
thou
speakest
fairly
said
the
uncles
ivar
will
give
as
dowry
to
randalin
the
estates
of
bjolstad
of
lis
of
hof
and
five
hundred
marks
of
this
dowry
is
acceptable
to
me
answered
the
hersir
of
svithjod
what
counter
dowry
wilt
thou
give
to
randalin
inquired
the
uncles
of
ivar
i
will
give
her
replied
yngvi
the
large
estate
of
rodelsvellir
and
five
hundred
marks
of
this
is
generous
on
thy
part
said
visbur
and
randvir
we
will
not
discuss
the
trousseau
which
ivar
ought
to
give
randalin
for
we
know
him
to
be
most
generous
and
proud
of
his
rank
and
dignity
and
that
he
wishes
randalin
to
have
such
an
outfit
as
becometh
the
daughter
of
the
hersir
of
randalin
was
sent
for
and
yngvi
said
to
her
i
have
a
marriage
to
propose
to
thee
my
daughter
which
i
think
will
suit
thee
well
i
did
not
wish
to
betroth
thee
without
thy
consent
what
thinkest
thou
of
marrying
ivar
hjorvardson
the
hersir
of
gotland
no
better
union
couldst
thou
form
in
all
the
northern
randalin
replied
father
no
one
could
better
please
me
and
the
goddess
var
has
listened
to
the
vows
made
between
us
for
ivar
and
i
love
each
then
ivar
was
summoned
to
the
conference
and
yngvi
addressed
him
thus
i
would
not
give
my
daughter
to
thee
ivar
if
i
did
not
like
thee
and
i
would
rather
have
thee
than
any
of
the
other
men
in
our
northern
lands
marry
randalin
for
i
consider
thee
the
foremost
in
mind
courage
and
ivar
thanked
yngvi
for
his
kind
words
and
for
his
consent
to
his
marriage
with
randalin
after
all
the
conditions
were
agreed
to
each
side
called
six
men
of
high
rank
and
the
agreement
of
the
marriage
was
recited
before
them
as
the
law
required
and
they
stood
as
witnesses
of
the
contract
it
was
agreed
that
the
betrothal
should
not
be
for
more
than
twelve
months
unless
unforeseen
circumstances
occurred
yngvi
then
said
to
randalin
i
betroth
thee
according
to
law
as
thy
father
and
guardian
it
is
a
complete
then
ivar
advanced
toward
yngvi
who
declared
ivar
betrothed
to
randalin
his
daughter
and
then
they
named
witnesses
to
their
betrothal
randalin
next
came
forward
and
said
thou
ivar
in
presence
of
these
witnesses
hast
betrothed
thyself
to
me
lawfully
give
me
the
counter
dowry
and
clasp
my
hand
as
the
fulfilment
and
performance
of
the
whole
agreement
which
a
little
while
ago
was
recited
before
us
without
fraud
or
trick
this
will
be
a
complete
and
lawful
according
to
law
said
ivar
we
name
witnesses
randalin
that
thou
hast
betrothed
thyself
to
me
ivar
hjorvardson
lawfully
i
give
thee
the
counter
dowry
with
handshaking
to
seal
the
agreement
as
the
fulfilment
and
performance
of
the
whole
contract
which
was
but
just
now
recited
between
then
laughingly
one
of
the
uncles
of
ivar
said
to
him
thou
knowest
ivar
that
the
breaking
of
a
betrothal
by
either
party
is
punished
and
whichever
party
breaks
it
forfeits
the
dowry
no
fear
of
this
exclaimed
ivar
and
randalin
at
the
same
time
as
they
stood
side
by
side
then
said
yngvi
addressing
ivar
randalin
has
no
faults
or
blemishes
on
her
person
if
thou
findest
faults
or
blemishes
in
her
which
i
have
not
told
thee
of
it
is
because
i
do
not
know
them
her
mother
as
thou
knowest
is
dead
and
she
is
the
one
that
could
tell
randalin
herself
says
she
has
no
blemish
if
she
has
thou
canst
refuse
to
marry
her
and
if
thou
canst
prove
that
i
knew
it
thou
mayest
claim
the
dowry
according
to
they
all
separated
very
happy
and
when
yngvi
was
alone
with
his
daughter
after
the
kinsmen
of
ivar
had
departed
he
said
to
her
daughter
thou
thinkest
that
ivar
is
perfection
a
short
time
after
thou
art
married
to
him
thou
wilt
find
that
he
has
faults
and
thou
wilt
perhaps
regret
that
thou
didst
not
marry
thorstein
who
like
ivar
loved
thee
and
who
aspired
silently
to
thy
hand
but
i
assure
thee
that
if
thou
hadst
married
thorstein
thou
wouldst
also
find
fault
in
him
for
there
is
no
man
no
matter
how
good
and
brave
he
is
that
is
without
a
fault
so
be
satisfied
though
thou
mayst
find
some
fault
in
ivar
and
though
the
ideal
thou
hadst
of
thy
lover
before
thou
hadst
known
him
well
and
lived
with
him
is
broken
many
dreams
of
youth
vanish
in
life
the
nornir
are
wise
and
none
of
us
knows
his
fate
the
following
morning
ivar
accompanied
by
several
of
the
men
of
gotland
and
followed
by
the
kinsmen
of
hjalmar
went
to
yngvi
and
explained
their
errand
which
was
to
ask
astrid
in
marriage
for
hjalmar
the
hersir
of
svithjod
listened
to
them
and
said
it
was
my
intention
to
betroth
my
daughter
to
another
man
for
i
did
not
know
that
hjalmar
and
astrid
loved
each
other
i
think
much
of
hjalmar
for
he
is
valiant
and
is
one
of
my
land
defenders
and
i
think
the
marriage
a
good
one
as
his
family
is
also
descended
from
the
conditions
of
the
marriage
and
the
length
of
the
betrothal
were
then
agreed
upon
before
witnesses
sigmund
was
also
betrothed
in
the
same
way
and
for
the
same
length
of
time
to
solveig
leaving
sigurd
the
only
one
of
the
four
with
free
heart
and
hand
chapter
xxix
ivar
s
duel
with
ketil
two
days
after
the
termination
of
the
games
a
great
feast
was
given
by
yngvi
to
all
his
kinsmen
and
all
the
men
and
women
who
had
come
to
upsalir
to
witness
the
contests
the
three
large
festive
halls
were
filled
with
guests
and
many
lots
were
drawn
among
warriors
for
seats
there
were
so
many
men
of
equal
rank
and
dignity
at
this
feast
the
announcement
of
the
betrothal
of
ivar
and
randalin
and
of
hjalmar
and
astrid
was
made
by
yngvi
their
father
and
that
of
solveig
to
sigmund
by
björn
her
father
all
the
hersirs
and
many
of
the
men
and
women
were
invited
to
the
wedding
of
ivar
and
randalin
which
was
to
take
place
first
when
bui
heard
that
astrid
had
been
betrothed
to
hjalmar
he
remembered
the
vow
he
had
made
the
preceding
yule
accordingly
when
the
feast
was
at
its
height
and
while
astrid
was
seated
by
the
side
of
her
father
bui
entered
the
hall
and
advanced
to
yngvi
s
side
told
the
vow
he
had
made
the
preceding
yule
in
regard
to
astrid
and
explained
that
his
errand
to
upsalir
was
to
ask
her
in
marriage
in
a
loud
voice
and
looking
defiantly
towards
hjalmar
he
said
that
he
requested
an
answer
on
the
instant
a
profound
silence
had
succeeded
the
chatter
of
voices
and
all
waited
to
hear
the
reply
of
the
hersir
of
svithjod
but
before
he
could
answer
hjalmar
stepped
forward
and
said
my
mind
has
always
been
bent
upon
marrying
astrid
remember
my
lord
how
i
have
defended
your
realm
and
increased
your
possessions
in
lands
you
have
betrothed
your
daughter
astrid
to
me
and
i
know
not
why
this
man
should
come
to
ask
her
hand
when
he
knows
that
she
is
betrothed
to
me
i
also
have
made
a
vow
upon
the
altar
ring
that
i
will
marry
astrid
and
allow
no
one
else
to
possess
her
besides
he
added
hotly
i
think
the
land
will
be
better
off
if
it
gets
rid
of
these
twelve
the
hersir
of
svithjod
after
hearing
these
two
men
turned
towards
astrid
and
said
to
her
what
sayest
thou
astrid
replied
i
am
betrothed
to
hjalmar
and
i
love
him
i
love
hjalmar
and
i
will
never
marry
any
one
else
but
him
for
he
is
good
and
brave
i
have
heard
but
evil
reports
of
bui
and
all
his
brothers
besides
our
fylkja
has
appeared
to
me
in
a
dream
and
told
me
to
beware
of
the
twelve
sons
of
when
bui
had
heard
her
words
he
challenged
hjalmar
to
a
duel
and
said
in
presence
of
all
the
guests
that
he
would
be
called
a
nithing
by
every
man
if
he
married
astrid
without
accepting
the
challenge
as
it
was
considered
cowardly
not
to
accept
a
challenge
hjalmar
said
scornfully
that
he
was
quite
ready
to
accept
his
defiance
and
the
time
of
the
duel
was
appointed
and
the
island
of
samsey
was
fixed
on
as
the
spot
where
it
was
to
take
place
this
challenge
had
hardly
been
given
when
a
great
hersir
and
mighty
champion
named
ketil
rose
up
before
yngvi
and
said
i
have
just
arrived
at
upsalir
and
the
games
are
ended
contrary
winds
have
followed
me
all
the
way
so
i
have
not
been
able
to
take
part
in
the
contests
i
am
much
disappointed
for
i
wanted
to
win
several
championships
and
have
trials
of
strength
and
agility
with
ivar
before
the
eyes
of
randalin
thy
daughter
i
have
made
a
vow
that
i
will
marry
randalin
and
that
no
one
else
shall
marry
her
before
stepping
over
my
dead
body
whoever
is
wooing
her
must
fight
a
duel
with
me
i
challenge
ivar
to
a
duel
to
take
place
at
arhaug
on
the
first
day
of
yule
and
he
shouted
so
loud
that
everybody
in
the
hall
heard
him
thou
ivar
shalt
be
every
man
s
nithing
if
thou
comest
not
to
the
duel
ivar
at
once
accepted
the
challenge
as
hjalmar
had
done
at
arhaug
ketil
and
his
men
sacrificed
he
practised
witchcraft
much
and
the
people
believed
that
no
weapons
could
pierce
his
or
hurt
him
he
only
made
sacrifices
to
the
sun
and
to
his
guardian
spirits
for
he
did
not
believe
in
odin
nor
in
the
other
gods
after
the
feast
was
over
ivar
and
his
left
svithjod
together
with
all
who
had
come
to
the
games
all
having
received
valuable
gifts
the
sons
of
hervard
had
gone
immediately
after
the
challenge
of
bui
to
hjalmar
not
in
the
best
of
moods
on
account
of
the
failure
of
their
mission
in
regard
to
astrid
they
went
home
and
told
their
father
of
the
result
of
their
errand
and
of
the
challenge
of
bui
to
hjalmar
hervard
answered
never
have
i
been
so
anxious
about
you
before
now
nowhere
do
i
know
of
men
equally
brave
and
so
skilled
in
the
handling
of
weapons
as
ivar
and
his
hjalmar
sigurd
and
they
talked
no
more
of
the
matter
that
evening
but
the
anxious
brow
of
hervard
told
of
his
anxiety
in
regard
to
the
duel
and
how
much
he
feared
for
the
lives
of
his
sons
after
the
departure
of
hjalmar
astrid
became
very
sad
her
sumptuous
home
seemed
to
have
no
charm
for
her
and
she
could
think
of
nothing
but
the
duel
which
was
to
take
place
between
hjalmar
and
bui
one
evening
as
her
father
was
all
alone
he
saw
her
come
into
the
hall
with
a
face
so
pale
that
he
called
her
to
his
side
she
responded
with
a
smile
trying
to
hide
her
feelings
for
she
did
not
wish
him
to
notice
how
sad
she
was
come
sit
by
me
daughter
said
he
in
a
tender
and
sympathetic
voice
after
seating
herself
by
her
father
s
side
astrid
laid
her
head
on
his
breast
and
remained
silent
hiding
her
face
in
the
folds
of
her
cloak
yngvi
took
her
hands
in
his
they
were
hot
and
feverish
and
as
he
petted
her
he
asked
her
not
knowing
what
was
the
trouble
if
the
marriage
that
had
been
arranged
between
her
and
hjalmar
was
not
to
her
liking
and
if
she
regretted
her
betrothal
sobs
were
the
only
answer
he
got
but
when
she
had
relieved
her
overburdened
breast
in
copious
tears
and
had
recovered
sufficiently
she
replied
father
i
am
pleased
and
i
would
marry
no
one
but
hjalmar
but
i
do
not
know
why
i
think
i
shall
never
see
him
again
why
so
said
yngvi
i
had
a
dream
before
the
games
replied
astrid
in
which
our
fylkja
appeared
and
forewarned
me
of
hjalmar
s
danger
and
told
me
that
the
twelve
eagles
i
saw
in
a
preceding
dream
were
the
twelve
sons
of
hervard
and
that
these
would
cause
me
great
sorrow
and
afterwards
she
called
me
towards
her
and
said
follow
i
think
this
forebode
the
death
of
hjalmar
and
perhaps
mine
the
decrees
of
the
nornir
must
be
fulfilled
and
none
of
us
know
what
they
yngvi
did
his
best
to
cheer
his
daughter
and
tried
to
persuade
her
that
her
dream
was
not
deserving
of
so
sinister
an
interpretation
but
it
was
difficult
to
comfort
her
randalin
too
was
anxious
about
the
result
of
the
duel
between
ivar
and
ketil
nevertheless
there
was
no
way
of
preventing
these
duels
and
the
time
for
that
between
ivar
and
ketil
soon
arrived
ivar
made
ready
two
ships
and
asked
many
doughty
champions
to
follow
him
he
had
sent
word
to
svithjod
to
men
of
high
renown
to
meet
him
at
arhaug
to
witness
the
duel
so
they
might
tell
on
their
return
to
upsalir
of
his
victory
or
that
he
died
with
honor
and
valor
he
sailed
for
arhaug
the
appointed
place
and
arrived
there
three
days
before
the
time
with
his
on
his
arrival
bodmod
the
son
of
ketil
invited
him
to
his
hall
and
there
he
and
his
men
were
entertained
with
great
splendor
in
the
course
of
conversation
ivar
mentioned
the
name
of
odin
at
the
mention
of
odin
bodmod
became
angry
and
sang
odin
i
have
never
worshipped
though
i
have
lived
long
i
know
that
the
head
of
ivar
will
fall
sooner
than
mine
or
that
of
my
but
ivar
sang
in
answer
i
love
odin
and
all
the
gods
and
sacrifice
to
them
and
i
know
that
odin
loves
on
the
day
appointed
for
the
duel
ivar
and
his
took
a
boat
and
rowed
to
a
small
island
where
the
conflict
was
to
take
place
ketil
was
there
already
waiting
for
ivar
a
great
crowd
had
assembled
on
the
shore
of
the
mainland
to
witness
the
contest
or
ordeal
between
these
two
famous
champions
for
the
people
believed
that
the
judgments
of
the
gods
were
decided
in
this
way
what
kind
of
duel
dost
thou
wish
us
to
have
asked
ketil
of
ivar
the
holmganga
or
the
einvigi
thou
art
the
challenged
man
and
thou
hast
the
right
to
choose
which
of
the
two
thou
wilt
ivar
answered
i
choose
the
holmganga
for
there
is
more
honor
and
fame
in
this
than
in
the
other
and
when
i
left
gotland
for
upsalir
to
participate
in
the
games
it
was
to
win
more
fame
than
i
had
before
there
are
two
alternatives
before
me
the
one
to
get
bravely
the
victory
in
fighting
against
thee
the
other
to
fall
with
valor
and
that
is
better
than
to
live
with
shame
and
but
said
ketil
why
dost
thou
choose
the
holmganga
instead
of
the
einvigi
thou
art
young
and
inexperienced
and
in
the
holmganga
there
are
difficult
rules
but
none
in
the
ivar
answered
i
shall
not
fight
better
in
the
einvigi
and
i
will
risk
the
holmganga
and
in
all
be
on
equal
footing
with
thee
though
much
younger
than
thyself
and
of
less
experience
i
am
not
afraid
of
the
holmganga
rules
i
have
handled
the
sword
many
a
time
though
i
have
never
done
so
in
a
duel
my
taught
me
well
its
use
and
the
rules
of
dueling
then
the
laws
of
the
holmganga
were
recited
by
sigurd
this
being
obligatory
before
a
duel
took
place
this
is
said
he
the
holmganga
law
the
cloak
must
be
ten
feet
from
one
end
to
the
other
with
loops
in
the
corners
and
in
these
pegs
must
be
put
down
the
one
who
makes
the
preparations
must
go
towards
the
pegs
hold
his
and
bending
over
stand
with
his
feet
apart
seeing
the
sky
between
them
three
squares
each
one
foot
wide
must
be
marked
around
the
cloak
outside
the
squares
must
be
placed
four
poles
called
hazel
poles
the
place
is
called
a
hazelled
field
when
it
is
prepared
thus
each
man
must
have
three
shields
and
when
these
are
made
useless
he
must
stand
upon
the
cloak
and
thereafter
defend
himself
with
his
weapons
he
who
has
been
challenged
is
to
strike
first
if
one
is
wounded
so
that
the
blood
falls
upon
the
cloak
he
is
not
obliged
to
fight
any
longer
if
either
steps
with
one
of
his
feet
outside
the
boundary
it
is
held
that
he
has
retreated
and
if
he
steps
outside
with
both
feet
he
is
held
to
have
fled
and
is
accounted
vanquished
have
you
ketil
and
ivar
taken
heed
of
the
holmganga
law
which
i
have
just
recited
to
you
asked
sigurd
in
conclusion
thou
hast
recited
well
and
correctly
the
laws
of
the
holmganga
sigurd
replied
ivar
as
customary
in
the
holmganga
one
man
held
the
shield
before
each
of
the
combatants
the
one
who
received
most
wounds
was
to
pay
an
indemnity
for
being
released
from
the
fight
for
it
was
the
law
of
the
holmganga
that
if
he
who
challenged
another
man
in
order
to
get
something
gained
the
victory
he
should
have
the
prize
for
which
he
had
challenged
if
he
was
defeated
he
should
release
himself
with
as
much
property
as
had
been
agreed
upon
if
he
fell
he
should
forfeit
all
his
property
and
he
who
killed
him
was
to
take
all
the
inheritance
it
was
the
custom
of
duelists
not
to
draw
their
swords
on
the
place
of
the
holmganga
but
let
the
sword
hang
on
the
arm
so
that
it
should
be
ready
at
once
when
wanted
at
the
outset
ketil
said
to
ivar
it
seems
to
me
that
the
sword
that
thou
carriest
is
longer
than
the
laws
of
the
holmganga
thou
canst
measure
my
sword
replied
ivar
and
thou
wilt
find
that
it
is
of
the
proper
length
and
according
to
the
then
ivar
said
to
hjalmar
thou
must
hold
the
shield
before
hjalmar
replied
i
have
done
that
for
no
one
before
my
beloved
rather
ask
me
to
go
into
holmganga
against
ketil
for
i
am
afraid
thou
riskest
too
much
i
do
not
want
to
part
from
thee
and
hope
the
nornir
have
fated
us
to
die
the
same
ivar
thanked
his
but
said
that
what
he
asked
could
not
be
granted
hjalmar
answered
in
case
of
thy
death
none
of
us
would
go
back
unless
thou
art
avenged
for
we
have
sworn
to
avenge
each
other
s
then
he
advanced
towards
ivar
and
took
the
three
shields
that
he
was
to
hold
before
him
and
handed
two
of
them
to
sigurd
and
sigmund
then
he
said
to
ivar
let
us
hope
that
victory
will
be
thine
but
thou
hast
to
fight
against
one
of
the
greatest
champions
of
our
land
a
man
very
skilled
in
the
handling
of
the
sword
and
of
the
now
it
is
better
to
stand
by
one
s
word
and
not
to
be
the
first
to
ask
for
peace
ketil
said
thou
art
right
replied
ivar
then
he
sang
lovely
maid
of
svithjod
i
fight
for
thee
i
will
come
to
thee
victorious
randalin
ketil
will
ketil
began
to
shout
fiercely
and
the
berserk
frenzy
came
upon
him
he
bit
the
rim
of
his
shield
and
looked
like
a
wild
beast
foam
came
from
his
mouth
but
after
a
while
he
became
himself
again
ivar
and
ketil
after
shaking
hands
went
inside
the
boundaries
of
the
dueling
place
and
placed
themselves
on
the
squares
that
were
marked
on
the
cloak
first
ivar
sang
thou
ketil
wilt
lodge
with
and
ketil
sang
back
i
do
not
put
my
trust
in
odin
but
before
night
thou
ivar
wilt
be
among
the
hjalmar
held
the
shield
of
ivar
and
bodmod
that
of
ketil
his
father
ivar
had
the
sword
hrotti
and
when
it
struck
ketil
s
shield
it
was
as
if
lightning
came
from
it
ketil
seeing
the
sparks
said
i
should
not
have
fought
against
thee
if
i
had
known
that
thou
hadst
hrotti
with
thee
it
is
most
likely
as
my
father
said
that
we
brothers
are
to
be
except
the
one
of
us
who
is
named
after
heedless
of
this
complaint
ivar
struck
at
ketil
s
shield
and
dealt
blow
after
blow
so
quickly
that
ketil
could
not
strike
him
having
to
shelter
himself
behind
his
then
ivar
drew
back
to
get
room
to
wield
his
sword
and
aim
a
blow
at
ketil
but
ketil
was
too
quick
for
him
and
ivar
s
shield
was
cut
asunder
new
shields
were
provided
and
these
were
equally
cut
to
pieces
each
side
had
now
spoiled
two
shields
both
combatants
had
only
one
shield
left
and
the
fight
was
to
be
decisive
then
followed
the
fiercest
of
combats
ketil
sang
there
is
courage
in
ketil
my
sword
hviting
is
sharp
it
will
belie
the
word
of
odin
i
tell
thee
ivar
it
is
unsafe
to
trust
him
use
thy
arms
and
hands
well
before
we
part
for
soon
thou
art
to
ivar
replied
soon
ketil
wilt
thou
fall
to
the
here
ketil
drew
back
with
a
swift
motion
to
wield
his
sword
more
easily
and
deal
a
death
blow
at
ivar
but
ivar
sprang
towards
him
just
at
this
instant
and
struck
him
a
blow
which
almost
cleft
his
shoulder
in
two
and
he
staggered
outside
the
mark
and
fell
mortally
wounded
thereupon
ketil
died
having
fought
and
fallen
valiantly
according
to
ancient
custom
a
large
bull
was
led
forward
and
sacrificed
by
ivar
as
the
victor
ivar
then
went
back
to
dampstadir
and
the
sviar
to
upsalir
to
tell
randalin
of
the
great
victory
of
ivar
who
on
account
of
this
deed
obtained
still
greater
renown
than
before
chapter
xxx
death
of
hjalmar
and
astrid
a
short
time
after
his
return
from
arhaug
and
his
memorable
duel
with
ketil
ivar
made
preparations
to
leave
dampstadir
with
his
three
for
samsey
in
order
to
be
there
at
the
time
appointed
for
the
duel
between
hjalmar
and
bui
before
sailing
hjalmar
made
a
solemn
sacrifice
to
odin
for
victory
they
sailed
with
two
small
ships
of
the
kind
called
ask
to
the
island
and
after
an
uneventful
voyage
arrived
there
and
cast
anchor
in
a
bay
called
munarvog
the
sons
of
hervard
likewise
made
their
preparations
the
night
before
they
sailed
thorgrim
had
a
dream
which
he
told
his
father
it
seemed
to
me
said
he
that
we
brothers
were
in
samsey
and
found
many
birds
there
and
killed
them
all
then
we
went
to
the
other
side
of
the
island
and
two
eagles
flew
against
us
i
had
a
hard
fight
against
one
of
them
and
at
last
both
of
us
sat
down
and
were
badly
wounded
the
other
eagle
fought
against
my
brothers
and
overcame
them
when
hervard
heard
this
he
became
more
concerned
than
ever
in
regard
to
the
lives
of
his
sons
for
in
this
dream
he
saw
a
warning
of
their
death
he
said
to
them
this
dream
needs
no
unravelling
for
it
is
plain
enough
i
am
sure
it
concerns
you
and
i
fear
that
the
men
who
fell
mean
the
sons
replied
that
they
did
not
fear
that
for
they
had
always
obtained
the
victory
before
all
men
go
the
day
they
have
been
fated
to
die
rejoined
hervard
and
they
spoke
no
more
on
the
subject
that
day
the
next
morning
the
twelve
brothers
went
to
their
ship
and
their
father
followed
them
to
the
shore
and
gave
good
armor
and
weapons
to
them
all
i
think
said
he
you
have
need
of
the
best
weapons
now
for
you
are
to
fight
against
most
valiant
champions
after
which
he
bade
them
farewell
and
they
departed
they
reached
samsey
and
landed
at
a
bay
called
unavog
on
the
other
side
of
the
island
from
where
hjalmar
and
his
men
were
after
the
sons
of
hervard
had
landed
the
berserk
fury
came
over
them
all
and
they
wrestled
with
trees
large
rocks
and
boulders
as
they
were
wont
when
this
madness
seized
them
after
a
time
they
became
quiet
again
and
rested
for
they
had
become
weak
as
was
always
the
case
after
the
berserk
fury
the
next
morning
they
walked
all
over
the
island
to
see
if
they
could
discover
traces
of
hjalmar
and
his
arrival
after
crossing
to
the
other
coast
they
saw
two
ships
and
knew
that
they
must
belong
to
hjalmar
then
they
drew
their
swords
bit
the
edges
of
their
shields
and
the
berserk
fury
came
over
them
all
again
they
boarded
the
ships
in
an
onset
of
irresistible
rage
six
of
them
attacking
each
ship
in
the
centre
so
brave
were
the
men
on
them
that
no
one
fled
from
his
place
or
spoke
a
word
of
fear
or
changed
color
six
of
the
brothers
went
forward
to
the
bow
and
the
other
six
towards
the
stern
and
slew
every
man
they
encountered
after
this
they
went
ashore
howling
and
shouting
hjalmar
and
the
had
gone
ashore
also
and
walked
over
the
island
to
see
if
bui
and
his
brothers
had
come
when
they
reached
a
hillock
from
which
they
could
see
their
own
ships
they
saw
men
coming
out
of
them
with
bloody
weapons
and
swords
and
recognized
the
sons
of
hervard
when
hjalmar
perceived
them
he
said
to
his
our
men
are
slain
and
they
were
so
brave
and
so
skilful
in
the
handling
of
weapons
that
it
seems
to
me
most
likely
that
we
shall
all
lodge
with
odin
in
valhalla
this
was
the
only
word
of
fear
that
hjalmar
had
ever
spoken
in
his
life
and
his
wondered
why
he
had
done
so
had
he
a
presentiment
that
his
disir
would
prove
faithless
to
him
when
ivar
heard
this
he
said
to
hjalmar
courage
often
is
better
than
a
sharp
sword
and
many
a
dull
sword
has
won
the
victory
we
will
be
victorious
over
the
sons
of
hervard
though
they
have
slain
all
the
brave
men
who
were
on
board
of
our
never
have
we
fled
from
our
foes
said
sigurd
let
us
rather
fall
under
their
weapons
and
die
with
honor
for
this
is
better
than
to
live
with
shame
and
we
will
fight
the
berserks
one
after
then
hjalmar
sang
we
will
not
lodge
with
odin
i
must
wed
astrid
before
i
die
and
ere
evening
comes
all
these
men
who
come
to
fight
against
us
will
be
dead
and
we
four
shall
the
sons
of
the
berserk
hervard
and
the
four
met
the
duel
was
to
be
the
einvigi
they
could
advance
or
retreat
as
they
pleased
and
no
shield
was
held
before
the
combatants
bui
was
armed
with
the
sword
called
rangvid
and
hjalmar
dragvandil
the
sword
which
his
father
had
given
him
when
he
became
of
age
as
they
met
in
the
arena
bui
said
if
either
of
us
escapes
he
shall
not
take
the
other
s
weapons
i
desire
to
have
rangvid
in
my
mound
if
i
die
hjalmar
shall
have
his
shirt
and
his
weapons
he
who
lives
shall
raise
a
mound
over
the
then
the
combat
began
in
earnest
and
was
fought
with
the
greatest
violence
both
struck
hard
and
often
when
ivar
and
sigurd
and
sigmund
had
looked
on
for
a
while
they
went
to
a
place
some
distance
away
and
made
ready
for
the
fight
with
the
other
eleven
sons
of
hervard
ivar
said
to
the
berserks
we
will
fight
according
to
the
custom
of
warriors
and
not
that
of
thralls
one
of
you
and
no
more
shall
fight
me
at
a
time
if
your
courage
fails
they
consented
and
then
seming
came
forward
and
ivar
went
against
him
hrotti
the
sword
which
ivar
had
chosen
and
which
belonged
to
his
father
was
so
good
that
it
cut
steel
as
if
it
were
cloth
it
was
not
long
before
seming
sank
dead
to
the
ground
olvir
then
came
forward
to
meet
ivar
and
after
a
short
fight
he
too
fell
dead
at
this
the
rage
of
the
berserks
was
overpowering
for
they
had
always
been
victorious
before
then
gisli
came
forward
he
was
next
to
thorgrim
the
strongest
and
most
skilful
of
the
eleven
brothers
he
attacked
ivar
so
fiercely
that
the
latter
at
first
could
do
no
more
than
defend
himself
they
fought
for
a
long
time
during
which
the
victory
seemed
doubtful
all
their
armor
was
cut
off
but
the
charmed
shirt
which
randalin
had
made
for
ivar
protected
his
body
so
he
was
not
hurt
finally
gisli
fell
after
receiving
many
wounds
then
thorgrim
fought
against
ivar
the
fight
was
very
severe
and
lasted
long
finally
thorgrim
lost
so
much
blood
that
he
fell
down
suddenly
and
at
once
died
one
brother
rose
after
the
other
but
ivar
slew
them
all
he
was
completely
exhausted
but
he
had
refused
the
help
of
sigurd
and
sigmund
for
he
thought
he
could
gain
the
victory
over
hervard
s
sons
more
easily
than
they
could
and
he
did
not
wish
to
risk
their
lives
after
this
the
repaired
to
the
spot
where
they
had
left
bui
and
hjalmar
fighting
and
they
saw
that
bui
had
fallen
and
lay
motionless
on
the
ground
and
that
hjalmar
sat
with
his
back
resting
against
a
rock
and
was
as
pale
as
a
corpse
ivar
approached
him
and
sang
what
ails
thee
hjalmar
thou
hast
changed
color
i
see
that
deep
wounds
weaken
thee
thy
helmet
is
cut
and
thy
is
pierced
near
thy
heart
thy
life
alas
is
soon
to
finish
and
ere
long
thou
art
going
to
in
reply
and
in
a
faint
voice
hjalmar
sang
i
have
sixteen
wounds
and
rent
it
is
dark
before
my
eyes
i
can
not
see
to
walk
the
sword
of
bui
has
touched
my
heart
the
sharp
point
hardened
in
poison
i
owned
five
burgs
but
i
never
enjoyed
them
as
thou
knowest
well
that
i
cared
not
for
occupation
on
land
soon
i
shall
lie
deprived
of
life
its
thread
sundered
by
the
sword
in
samsey
i
would
i
could
have
married
astrid
before
going
to
odin
but
the
nornir
decreed
at
my
birth
that
this
should
not
take
place
i
left
the
young
astrid
on
that
fated
day
destined
never
to
see
her
again
how
well
it
is
for
man
not
to
know
his
fate
beforehand
for
sorrow
would
have
followed
me
and
instead
i
thought
only
of
then
he
called
ivar
to
his
side
and
said
draw
from
my
hand
my
the
ring
and
take
it
to
astrid
i
know
that
it
will
be
to
her
a
lasting
sorrow
that
i
do
not
come
back
to
then
after
another
pause
he
continued
the
women
on
land
will
not
hear
that
i
sheltered
myself
from
blows
the
wise
maidens
in
upsalir
will
not
laugh
because
i
succumbed
in
the
fight
as
well
as
my
adversary
whom
i
slew
then
raising
himself
he
continued
seest
thou
ivar
from
a
high
tree
a
raven
flying
from
the
east
an
eagle
follows
that
is
the
last
eagle
to
which
i
give
prey
and
it
will
taste
my
blood
it
is
my
wish
that
thou
carry
my
helmet
and
into
yngvi
s
hall
the
heart
of
the
daughter
of
the
hersir
of
svithjod
will
be
moved
deeply
when
she
sees
my
cut
upon
the
breast
i
behold
the
daughters
of
yngvi
in
upsalir
how
beautiful
they
look
hjalmar
will
not
look
again
upon
them
neither
will
he
cheer
with
ale
and
speeches
the
warriors
who
sit
in
yngvi
s
then
came
another
pause
for
hjalmar
was
suffering
intensely
from
his
wounds
but
he
had
made
a
vow
never
to
shriek
from
pain
finally
he
said
to
his
two
of
you
must
go
and
hew
a
stone
coffin
for
me
while
another
shall
sit
by
my
side
and
write
upon
wooden
tablets
that
song
which
i
will
compose
about
my
deeds
in
then
he
began
to
dictate
the
song
and
sigmund
carved
it
and
the
nearer
the
poem
drew
to
its
end
the
more
the
life
of
hjalmar
ebbed
away
then
came
a
deep
silence
his
voice
had
ceased
he
was
dead
then
ivar
said
solemnly
it
will
be
told
far
and
wide
that
few
nobler
and
more
famous
men
have
ever
lived
than
hjalmar
gudbrandson
of
after
the
words
of
ivar
the
looked
at
each
other
without
saying
a
word
but
all
felt
the
great
and
irreparable
loss
they
had
sustained
they
placed
the
berserks
in
a
heap
near
the
sea
and
piled
boughs
upon
them
they
put
with
them
their
weapons
and
clothing
divesting
them
of
nothing
they
covered
the
pile
with
turf
and
cast
earth
over
it
thus
raising
a
great
mound
they
then
went
out
to
their
ships
took
ashore
every
one
who
had
fallen
and
there
threw
up
another
mound
over
them
after
the
burial
of
the
berserks
the
three
carried
the
body
of
hjalmar
on
one
of
their
ships
and
sailed
to
svithjod
they
landed
not
far
from
upsalir
ivar
carried
hjalmar
on
his
back
followed
by
sigurd
and
sigmund
and
then
laid
down
their
beloved
dead
at
the
door
of
the
great
hall
chanting
as
they
walked
there
the
praises
and
great
deeds
of
valor
of
hjalmar
after
entering
the
hall
they
marched
towards
the
high
seat
where
yngvi
was
seated
and
then
put
down
on
the
floor
and
in
front
of
him
hjalmar
s
pierced
armor
his
sword
helmet
and
sundered
shield
these
tokens
told
without
words
of
the
death
of
hjalmar
the
brave
ivar
and
his
two
then
went
to
the
bower
of
astrid
she
was
seated
on
a
chair
and
was
embroidering
a
cloak
for
hjalmar
and
thinking
of
him
then
ivar
sang
again
the
great
and
valorous
deeds
hjalmar
had
accomplished
during
his
life
and
said
i
have
to
tell
thee
astrid
a
sad
tale
and
he
gave
her
the
ring
which
she
had
given
to
hjalmar
before
they
parted
and
told
of
the
greetings
sent
her
by
him
before
he
expired
astrid
took
the
ring
looked
at
it
and
knew
that
hjalmar
was
dead
she
uttered
not
a
word
her
face
changed
color
and
turned
very
pale
she
sank
back
lifeless
into
her
chair
she
did
not
stir
for
so
long
that
her
attendants
became
alarmed
bending
over
her
they
saw
that
she
was
dead
nothing
better
has
occurred
for
a
long
time
said
ivar
let
us
welcome

carried
her
to

of
the
hall
and
laid
her
in

and
then
went
to

saw
with
profound
grief
the

silently
out
upon

chapter
xxxi
the
wedding
of
ivar
and
randalin
about
a
year
after
the
sad
events
just
recorded
the
day
of
the
union
of
ivar
and
randalin
approached
great
preparations
were
made
in
upsalir
for
their
wedding
the
most
costly
tapestries
that
had
been
embroidered
by
the
successive
wives
and
daughters
of
the
hersirs
of
svithjod
had
been
taken
out
from
the
where
they
had
been
sacredly
kept
for
these
were
only
used
for
adorning
the
walls
of
the
halls
at
weddings
many
of
them
represented
romantic
episodes
in
the
courtship
of
the
maidens
who
had
embroidered
them
likewise
the
bridal
bench
ornamented
with
gold
and
silver
and
with
rich
carvings
was
brought
out
how
many
beautiful
daughters
of
the
hersirs
of
svithjod
had
been
seated
upon
those
benches
since
upsalir
had
been
founded
what
an
array
of
illustrious
maidens
could
be
named
what
a
history
could
be
told
to
us
of
the
race
descended
from
them
what
a
diversity
of
character
and
temper
these
women
possessed
but
in
despite
of
that
splendor
of
life
many
a
young
heart
had
been
disappointed
for
their
union
had
not
proved
as
congenial
and
as
happy
as
they
expected
many
of
the
girlish
visions
and
dreams
which
belong
to
youth
had
not
been
fulfilled
as
they
had
hoped
the
nornir
had
woven
a
thick
mist
before
their
eyes
to
hide
the
future
many
had
found
that
station
fame
wealth
and
power
did
not
give
happiness
and
had
often
envied
the
merry
laughter
that
came
from
the
house
of
the
humble
and
even
from
the
cabin
of
the

two

a
jewel

her
head

her
neck
could
be
seen
through
the
transparent
linen

necklace
of
gold
beads
upon
which
the
artist
had
lavished
his
greatest
skill
from
her
belt
of
gold
hung
a
bunch
of
keys
showing
that
she
was
to
rule
the
household
of
ivar
with
a
slow
and
majestic
step

then
came
thorbrand
and
thord
and
the
rest
seated
themselves
according
to
their
rank
by
one
accord
they
had
given
the
precedence
to
sigurd
and
sigmund
not
that
they
were
the
highest
but
because
they
knew
the
love
that
existed
between
ivar
and
his
two
who
had
shared
so
many
dangers
together
on
the
