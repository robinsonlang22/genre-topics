only
a
few
of
the
kindly
reviewers
of
the
earlier
editions
of
crowded
out
o
crofield
have
suggested
that
it
has
at
all
exaggerated
the
possible
career
of
its
boy
and
girl
actors
if
any
others
have
silently
agreed
with
them
it
may
be
worth
while
to
say
that
the
pictures
of
places
and
the
doings
of
older
and
younger
people
are
pretty
accurately
historical
the
story
and
the
writing
of
it
were
suggested
in
a
conversation
with
an
energetic
american
boy
who
was
crowded
out
of
his
own
village
into
a
career
which
led
to
something
much
more

chapter
i
the
blacksmith
boy
i
going
to
the
city
he
stood
in
the
wide
door
of
the
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
looking
down
the
street
toward
the
rickety
old
bridge
over
the
cocahutchie
he
was
a
boy
and
if
he
was
really
only
about
fifteen
he
was
tall
for
his
age
across
the
top
of
the
door
over
his
head
stretched
a
cracked
and
faded
sign
with
a
horseshoe
painted
on
one
end
and
a
hammer
on
the
other
and
the
name
john
ogden
almost
faded
out
between
them
the
was
a
great
rusty
grimy
clutter
of
vises
tools
iron
in
bars
and
rods
and
all
sorts
of
old
iron
scraps
and
things
that
looked
as
if
they
needed
making
over
the
forge
was
in
the
middle
on
one
side
and
near
it
was
hitched
a
horse
pawing
the
ground
with
a
hoof
that
bore
a
new
shoe
on
the
anvil
was
a
brilliant
loop
of
iron
that
was
not
quite
yet
a
new
shoe
and
it
was
sending
out
bright
sparks
as
a
hammer
fell
upon
it
thud
thud
thud
and
a
clatter
over
the
anvil
leaned
a
tall
muscular
grimy
man
his
face
wore
a
disturbed
and
anxious
look
and
it
was
covered
with
charcoal
dust
there
was
altogether
too
much
charcoal
along
the
high
bridge
of
his
roman
nose
and
over
his
jutting
eyebrows
the
boy
in
the
door
also
had
some
charcoal
on
his
cheeks
and
forehead
but
none
upon
his
nose
his
nose
was
not
precisely
like
the
blacksmith
it
was
high
and
roman
down
but
just
there
was
a
little
dent
and
the
rest
of
the
nose
was
straight
his
complexion
excepting
the
freckles
and
charcoal
was
chiefly
sunburn
down
to
the
neckband
of
his
blue
checked
shirt
he
was
a
tough
boy
and
there
was
a
kind
of
smiling
expression
in
his
eyes
and
around
his
firm
mouth
i
going
to
the
city
he
said
again
in
a
low
but
positive
voice
i
get
there
somehow
just
then
a
short
man
came
hurrying
past
him
into
the
shop
he
was
probably
the
whitest
man
going
into
that
or
any
other
shop
and
he
spoke
out
at
once
very
fast
but
with
a
voice
that
sounded
as
if
it
came
through
a
bag
of
meal
ogden
said
he
got
him
shod
if
you
have
i
take
him
what
do
you
say
about
that
trade
i
do
want
any
more
room
than
there
is
here
said
the
blacksmith
and
i
do
care
to
move
my
shop
there
nigh
onto
two
acres
mebbe
more
all
along
the
creek
from
below
the
mill
to
deacon
hawkins
line
below
the
bridge
wheezed
the
mealy
floury
dusty
man
rapidly
i
get
two
hundred
for
it
some
day
ground
or
no
ground
best
place
for
a
shop
this
lot
suits
me
said
the
smith
hammering
away
pay
me
to
move
not
in
these
times
the
miller
had
more
to
say
while
he
unhitched
his
horse
but
he
led
him
out
without
getting
any
more
favorable
reply
about
the
trade
come
and
blow
jack
said
the
smith
and
the
boy
in
the
door
turned
promptly
to
take
the
handle
of
the
bellows
the
little
heap
of
charcoal
and
coke
in
the
forge
brightened
and
sent
up
fiery
tongues
as
the
great
leathern
lungs
wheezed
and
sighed
and
jack
himself
began
to
puff
i
got
to
have
a
bigger
man
than
you
are
for
a
blower
and
striker
said
the
smith
he
coming
monday
morning
it
time
you
were
doing
something

jack
as
he
ceased
pulling
on
the
bellows

the
fire

said
his
father
as
he
sizzed
the
bit
of
bent
iron
in
the
and
then
threw
it
on
the
ground
seven
that

either
worst
times
there
ever
were
in
crofield
there
was
gloom
as
well
as
charcoal
on
the
face
of
the
blacksmith
but
jack
expression
was
only
respectfully
serious
as
he
walked
away
without
speaking
and
again
stood
in
the
door
for
a
moment
i
could
catch
something
in
the
city
i
know
i
could
he
said
to
himself
how
on
earth
shall
i
get
there
the
bridge
at
the
lower
end
of
the
sloping
on
which
the
shop
stood
was
long
and
high
it
was
made
to
fit
the
road
and
was
a
number
of
sizes
too
large
for
the
stream
of
water
rippling
under
it
the
climbed
about
twenty
rods
the
other
way
into
what
was
evidently
the
main
street
of
crofield
there
was
a
tavern
on
one
corner
and
across
the
street
from
that
there
was
a
drug
store
and
in
it
was
the
on
the
two
opposite
corners
were
shops
and
all
along
main
street
were
all
sorts
of
business
establishments
sandwiched
in
among
the
dwellings
it
was
not
yet
noon
but
crofield
had
a
sleepy
look
as
if
all
its
work
for
the
whole
week
were
done
even
the
horses
of
the
farmers
teams
hitched
in
front
of
the
stores
looked
sleepy
jack
ogden
took
his
longest
look
this
time
at
a
neat
across
the
way
seems
to
me
there
is
nearly
so
much
room
in
it
as
there
used
to
be
he
said
to
himself
it
just
packed
and
crowded
i
going
he
turned
and
walked
on
up
toward
main
street
as
if
that
were
the
best
thing
he
could
do
till
dinner
time
not
many
minutes
later
a
girl
plainly
but
neatly
dressed
came
slowly
along
in
front
of
the
village
green
away
up
main
street
she
was
tall
and
slender
and
her
hair
and
eyes
were
as
dark
as
those
of
john
ogden
the
blacksmith
her
nose
was
like
his
too
except
that
it
was
finer
and
not
so
high
and
she
wore
very
much
the
same
anxious
discontented
look
upon
her
face
she
was
walking
slowly
because
she
saw
coming
toward
her
a
portly
lady
with
hair
so
flaxy
that
no
gray
would
show
in
it
she
was
elegantly
dressed
she
stopped
and
smiled
and
looked
very
condescending
mary
ogden
she
said
miss
glidden
said
mary
the
anxious
look
in
her
eyes
changing
to
a
gleam
that
made
them
seem
very
wide
awake
it
a
fine
morning
mary
ogden
but
so
very
warm
is

mother

must
hear
the
elder
he
to
inspect
the
your
class
miss
glidden
began
mary
and
her
face
suggested
that
somebody
was
blowing
upon
a
kind
of
fire
inside
her
cheeks
and
that
they
would
be
very
red
in
a
minute
yes

fail
to
be
there
mary
the
choir

full
of
course
i
shall
be

i
hope

miss
glidden
the
portly
lady
saw
something
up
the
street
at
that
moment
oh
my
what
is
it
dear
me
it
coming
run
we
all
be
killed
oh
my
she
had
turned
quite
around
while
she
was
speaking
and
was
once
more
looking
up
the
street
but
the
girl
had
neither
flinched
nor
wavered
she
had
only
sent
a
curious
inquiring
glance
in
the
direction
of
the
shouts
and
the
rattle
and
the
cloud
of
dust
that
were
coming
swiftly
toward
them
a
runaway
team
she
said
quietly
nobody
in
the
wagon
dear
me
exclaimed
miss
glidden
but
mary
began
to
move
away
looking
not
at
her
but
at
the
runaway
and
she
did
not
hear
the
rest
mary
ogden
too
somebody
be
killed
i
know
they
will
got
to
be
taken
there
they
come
dressed
too
well
for
a
blacksmith
daughter
does
know
her
oh
dear
i
so
frightened
perhaps
she
had
been
wise
in
getting
behind
the
nearest
tree
it
was
a
young
maple
two
inches
through
lately
set
out
but
it
might
have
stopped
a
pair
of
very
small
horses
those
in
the
road
were
large
almost
too
large
to
run
well
they
were
grays
and
they
came
thundering
along
in
a
way
that
was
really
fine
to
behold
heads
down
necks
arched
nostrils
wide
reins
flying
the
wagon
behind
them
banging
and
swerving
no
wonder
everybody
stood
still
and
except
mary
ogden
shouted
stop
one
young
fellow
across
the
street
stood
still
only
until
the
runaways
were
all
but
close
by
him
then
he
darted
out
into
the
street
not
ahead
of
them
but
behind
them
no
man
on
earth
could
have
stopped
those
horses
by
standing
in
front
of
them
they
could
have
charged
through
a
regiment
their
heavy
furious
gallop
was
fast
too
and
the
boy
who
was
now
following
them
must
have
been
as
light
of
foot
as
a
young
deer
hurrah
hurrah
go
it
jack
catch
bully
for
you
arose
from
a
score
of
people
along
the
sidewalk
as
he
bounded
forward
it
jack
oh
dear
me
but
it
just
like
him
there
he
in
exclaimed
mary
ogden
her
dark
eyes
dancing
proudly
why
it
that
brother
of
mary
ogden
he
the
blacksmith
boy
i
afraid
he
will
be
hurt
remarked
miss
glidden
kindly
and
benevolently
but
all
the
rest
shouted
hurrah
again
fierce
was
the
strain
upon
the
young
runner
for
a
moment
and
then
his
hands
were
on
the
of
the
bouncing
wagon
a
tug
a
spring
a
swerve
of
the
wagon
and
jack
ogden
was
in
it
and
in
a
second
more
the
loosely
flying
reins
were
in
his
hands
the
strong
arms
of
his
father
were
they
twice
as
strong
could
not
at
once
have
pulled
in
those
horses
and
one
man
on
the
sidewalk
seemed
to
be
entirely
correct
when
he
said
he
a
plucky
little
fellow
but
he
ca
do
a
thing
now
he
there
illustration
his
sister
was
trembling
all
over
but
she
was
repeating
he
did
it
splendidly
he
can
do
anything
jack
in
the
wagon
was
thinking
only
i
know
they
old
hammond
team
they
try
to
go
home
to
the
mill
they
smash
everything
if
i
do
look
out
it
is
something
even
to
a
greatly
frightened
horse
to
feel
a
hand
on
the
rein
the
team
intended
to
turn
out
of
main
street
at
the
corner
and
they
made
the
turn
but
they
did
not
crash
the
wagon
to
pieces
against
the
corner
post
because
of
the
desperate
guiding
that
was
done
by
jack
the
wagon
swung
around
without
upsetting
it
tilted
fearfully
and
the
nigh
wheel
was
in
the
air
for
a
moment
until
weight
helped
bring
it
down
again
there
was
a
short
sharp
scream
across
the
street
when
the
wagon
swung
and
the
wheel
went
up
down
the
slope
toward
the
bridge
thundered
the
galloping
team
and
the
blacksmith
ran
out
of
his
shop
to
see
it
pass
turn
them
into
the
creek
jack
he
shouted
but
there
was
no
time
for
any
answer
they
smash
through
the
bridge
thought
jack
i
know
what
about
there
were
down
from
the
street
at
the
left
of
the
bridge
where
many
a
team
had
descended
to
drink
the
water
of
the
cocahutchie
but
it
required
all
jack
strength
on
one
rein
to
make
his
runaways
take
that
direction
they
had
thought
of
going
toward
the
mill
but
they
knew
the
not
many
rods
below
the
bridge
stood
a
clump
of
half
a
dozen
gigantic
trees
remnants
of
the
old
forest
which
had
been
replaced
by
the
streets
of
crofield
and
the
farms
around
it
jack
pull
on
the
left
rein
was
obeyed
only
too
well
and
it
looked
for
some
seconds
as
if
the
plunging
beasts
were
about
to
wind
up
their
maddened
dash
by
a
wreck
among
those
gnarled
trunks
and
projecting
roots
jack
drew
his
breath
hard
and
there
was
almost
a
chill
at
his
young
heart
but
he
held
hard
and
said
nothing
forward
one
plunge
more
hard
on
the
right
rein
that
was
close
he
said
if
we
did
go
right
between
the
big
maple
and
the
cherry
now
i
got
splash
crash
rattle
spattering
and
plunging
but
cooling
fast
the
gray
team
galloped
along
the
shallow
bed
of
the
cocahutchie
i
wish
the
old
was
deeper
said
jack
but
the
very
low
whoa
boys
whoa
there
almost
up
to
the
hub
over
the
hub
whoa
now
and
the
gray
team
ceased
its
plunging
and
stood
still
in
water
three
feet
deep
i
must
let
drink
too
much
said
jack
but
a
little
wo
hurt
the
horses
were
trembling
all
over
but
one
after
the
other
they
put
their
noses
into
the
water
and
then
raised
their
heads
to
prick
their
ears
back
and
forth
and
look
round
do
bring
ashore
till
they
quiet
jack
called
out
the
deep
ringing
voice
of
his
father
from
the
bank
there
he
stood
and
other
men
were
coming
on
the
run
the
tall
blacksmith
black
eyes
were
flashing
with
pride
over
the
daring
feat
his
son
had
performed
i
dare
tell
him
though
he
said
to
himself
he
set
up
enough
he
thinks
he
can
do
anything
jack
wheezed
a
mealy
voice
at
his
side
that
my
team
i
know
it
said
jack
they
all
right
now
pretty
close
shave
through
the
trees
that
was
i
owe
ye
fifty
dollars
for
them
and
the
wagin
said
the
miller
it
wuth
it
and
i
pay
it
but
i
got
to
owe
it
to
ye
jest
now
times
are
awful
hard
in
crofield
if
i
ha
lost
them
hosses
and
that
wagin
he
stopped
short
as
if
he
could
not
exactly
say
how
disastrous
it
would
have
been
for
him
there
was
a
running
fire
of
praise
and
of
questions
poured
at
jack
by
the
gathering
knot
of
people
on
the
shore
and
it
was
several
minutes
before
his
father
spoke
again
they
cool
now
he
said
turn
jack
and
walk
out
by
the
bridge
and
up
to
the
mill
then
come
home
to
dinner
jack
pretended
not
to
see
quite
a
different
kind
of
group
gathered
under
the
clump
of
tall
trees
not
a
voice
had
come
to
him
from
that
group
of
and
yet
the
fact
that
they
were
there
made
him
tingle
all
over
two
large
women
were
hugging
each
other
and
wiping
their
eyes
and
a
very
small
girl
was
tugging
at
their
dresses
and
crying
while
a
pair
of
girls
of
from
twelve
to
fourteen
close
by
them
seemed
very
much
inclined
to
dance
two
small
boys
who
at
first
belonged
to
the
party
had
quickly
rolled
up
their
trousers
and
waded
out
as
far
as
they
could
into
the
cocahutchie
just
in
front
of
the
group
under
the
trees
stood
mary
ogden
straight
as
an
arrow
her
dark
eyes
flashing
and
her
cheeks
glowing
while
she
looked
silently
at
the
boy
on
the
wagon
in
the
stream
until
she
saw
him
wheel
the
grays
even
then
she
did
not
say
anything
but
turned
and
walked
away
it
was
as
if
she
had
so
much
to
say
that
she
felt
she
could
not
say
it
aunt
melinda
mother
said
one
of
the
girls
jack
is
hurt
a
mite
they
all
ha
been
drowned
though
if
there
was
water
enough
hush
bessie
said
one
of
the
large
women
and
the
other
at
once
echoed
hush
bessie
they
were
very
nearly
alike
these
women
and
they
both
had
long
straight
noses
such
as
jack
would
have
been
if
down
it
had
not
been
roman
like
his
father
mary
ann
said
the
first
woman
we
must
say
too
much
to
him
about
it
he
can
only
just
be
held
in
now
hush
melinda
said
jack
mother
i
thought
i
seen
the
last
of
him
when
the
gray
critters
came
down
the
road
past
the
house
and
then
she
wiped
her
eyes
again
and
so
did
aunt
melinda
and
they
both
stooped
down
at
the
same
moment
saying
jack
safe
sally
and
picked
up
the
small
girl
who
was
crying
and
kissed
her
the
gray
team
was
surrendered
to
its
owner
as
soon
as
it
reached
the
road
at
the
foot
of
the
bridge
and
again
jack
was
loudly
praised
by
the
miller
the
rest
of
the
ogden
family
seemed
to
be
disposed
to
keep
away
but
the
tall
blacksmith
himself
was
there
jack
said
he
as
they
turned
away
homeward
you
can
go
fishing
this
afternoon
just
as
i
said
i
was
thinking
of
your
doing
something
else
afterward
but
you
done
about
enough
for
one
day
he
had
more
to
say
concerning
what
would
have
happened
to
the
horses
and
the
number
of
pieces
the
wagon
would
have
been
knocked
into
but
for
the
manner
in
which
the
whole
team
had
been
saved
when
they
reached
the
house
the
front
door
was
open
but
nobody
was
to
be
seen
bob
and
jim
the
two
small
boys
had
not
yet
returned
from
seeing
the
gray
span
taken
to
the
mill
and
the
women
and
girls
had
gone
through
to
the
kitchen
jack
said
his
father
as
they
went
in
old
hammond
owe
you
that
fifty
dollars
long
enough
he
never
really
pays
anything
course
he
does
not
if
he
can
help
it
said
jack
i
worked
for
him
three
months
and
you
know
we
had
to
take
it
out
in
feed
i
learned
the
mill
trade
though
and
that
was
something
just
then
he
was
suddenly
embarrassed
ogden
had
gone
through
the
house
and
out
at
the
back
door
and
aunt
melinda
had
followed
her
and
so
had
the
girls
molly
had
suddenly
gone
to
her
own
room
aunt
melinda
had
taken
everything
off
the
kitchen
stove
and
put
everything
back
again
and
here
now
was
ogden
back
again
hugging
her
son
jack
she
said
do
you
ever
ever
do
such
a
thing
again
you
might
ha
been
knocked
into
slivers
molly
had
gone
up
the
back
stairs
only
to
come
down
the
front
way
and
she
was
now
a
little
behind
them
mother
she
exclaimed
as
if
her
admiration
for
her
brother
was
exploding
you
ought
to
have
seen
him
jump
in
and
you
ought
to
have
seen
that
wagon
go
around
the
corner
jack
broke
in
the
voice
of
aunt
melinda
from
the
kitchen
doorway
come
and
eat
something
i
felt
as
if
i
knew
you
were
killed
sure
if
you
have
earned
your
dinner
nobody
has
why
i
know
how
to
drive
said
jack
i
was
afraid
of
after
i
got
hold
of
the
reins
he
seemed
even
in
a
hurry
to
get
through
his
dinner
and
some
minutes
later
he
was
out
in
the
garden
digging
for
bait
the
rest
of
the
family
remained
at
the
table
longer
than
usual
especially
bob
and
jim
but
for
some
reason
known
to
herself
mary
did
not
say
a
word
about
her
meeting
with
miss
glidden
perhaps
the
miller
gray
team
had
run
away
with
all
her
interest
in
that
but
she
did
not
even
tell
how
carefully
miss
glidden
had
inquired
after
the
family
there
goes
jack
she
said
at
last
and
they
all
turned
to
look
he
did
not
say
anything
as
he
passed
the
kitchen
door
but
he
had
his
long
cane
over
his
shoulder
it
had
a
line
wound
around
it
ready
for
use
he
went
out
of
the
gate
and
down
the
road
toward
the
bridge
and
gave
only
a
glance
across
at
the
shop
i
did
get
many
worms
he
said
to
himself
at
the
bridge
but
i
can
dig
some
more
if
the
fish
bite
sometimes
they
do
and
sometimes
they
do
over
the
bridge
he
went
and
up
a
wagon
track
on
the
opposite
bank
but
he
paused
for
one
moment
in
the
very
middle
of
the
bridge
to
look
up
stream
there
just
enough
water
to
run
the
mill
he
said
there
is
any
coming
over
the
dam
the
pond
even
full
though
and
it
may
be
a
good
day
for
fish
i
wish
i
was
in
the
city
chapter
ii
the
fish
were
there
saturday
afternoon
was
before
jack
ogden
when
he
came
out
at
the
water
edge
near
the
dam
across
from
the
mill
that
was
there
big
and
red
and
and
the
dam
was
there
and
above
them
was
the
spreading
out
over
a
number
of
acres
and
ornamented
with
stumps
old
logs
and
weeds
it
was
a
fairly
good
pond
the
best
that
cocahutchie
creek
could
do
for
crofield
but
face
fell
a
little
as
he
looked
at
it
there
are
more
fellows
than
fish
here
he
said
to
himself
with
an
air
of
disgust
there
was
a
boy
at
the
end
of
the
dam
near
him
and
a
boy
in
the
middle
of
it
and
two
boys
at
the
flume
near
the
mill
there
were
three
punts
out
on
the
water
and
one
of
them
had
in
it
a
man
and
two
boys
while
the
second
boat
held
but
one
man
and
the
third
contained
four
a
big
stump
near
the
north
shore
supported
a
boy
and
the
old
snag
jutting
out
from
the
south
shore
held
a
boy
and
a
man
there
they
all
were
sitting
perfectly
still
until
one
after
another
each
rod
and
line
came
up
to
have
its
hook
and
bait
examined
to
see
whether
or
not
there
had
really
been
a
bite
i
fairly
crowded
out
remarked
jack
those
fellows
have
all
the
good
places
i
have
to
go
somewhere
else
where
i
go
he
studied
that
problem
for
a
full
minute
while
every
fisherman
there
turned
to
look
at
him
and
then
turned
back
to
watch
his
line
i
guess
i
try
down
stream
said
jack
nobody
ever
caught
anything
down
there
and
nobody
ever
goes
there
but
i
i
might
as
well
try
it
just
for
once
he
turned
away
along
the
track
over
which
he
had
come
he
did
not
pause
at
the
road
and
bridge
but
went
on
down
the
further
bank
of
the
cocahutchie
it
was
a
pretty
stream
of
water
and
it
spread
out
wide
and
shallow
and
rippled
merrily
among
stones
and
bowlders
and
clumps
of
willow
and
alder
for
nearly
half
a
mile
gradually
then
it
grew
narrower
quieter
deeper
and
wore
a
sleepy
look
which
made
it
seem
more
in
keeping
with
quiet
old
crofield
the
hay
about
ready
to
cut
said
jack
as
he
plodded
along
the
path
near
the
water
edge
through
a
thriving
meadow
of
clover
and
timothy
there
always
plenty
of
work
in
haying
time
hullo
what
grasshoppers
jingo
as
he
made
the
last
exclamation
he
clapped
his
hand
upon
his
trousers
pocket
if
i
did
forget
to
go
in
and
get
my
sinker
never
did
such
a
thing
before
in
all
my
life
what
the
use
of
trying
to
fish
without
a
sinker
the
luck
seemed
to
be
going
directly
against
him
even
the
cocahutchie
at
his
left
had
dwindled
to
a
mere
crack
between
bushes
and
high
grass
as
if
to
show
that
it
had
no
room
to
let
for
fish
to
live
in
that
is
for
fish
accustomed
to
having
plenty
of
room
such
as
they
could
find
when
living
in
a
lined
around
the
edges
with
boys
and
that
a
whopper
suddenly
exclaimed
jack
with
a
quick
snatch
at
something
that
alighted
upon
his
left
arm
i
caught
him
grasshoppers
are
the
best
kind
of
bait
too
i
try
him
on
sinker
or
no
sinker
hope
there
are
some
fish
down
here
the
line
he
unwound
from
his
rod
was
somewhat
coarse
but
it
was
strong
and
so
was
his
hook
as
if
the
fishing
around
crofield
called
for
stout
tackle
as
well
as
for
a
large
number
of
sportsmen
the
big
jumper
was
placed
in
position
on
the
hook
and
then
with
several
more
grumbling
regrets
over
the
absence
of
any
sinker
jack
searched
along
the
bank
for
a
place
whence
he
could
throw
his
bait
into
the
water
this
do
he
said
at
last
and
the
breeze
helped
him
to
swing
out
his
line
until
the
grasshopper
at
the
end
of
it
dropped
lightly
and
naturally
into
a
dark
little
eddy
almost
across
that
narrow
ribbon
of
the
cocahutchie
splash
tug
splash
again
jingo
what
that
i
declare
if
he
is
pulling
he
break
the
line
no
he
wo
see
that
pole
bend
steady
here
he
comes
hurrah
out
he
came
indeed
for
the
rude
strong
tackle
held
even
against
the
game
struggling
of
that
vigorous
trout
there
he
lay
now
on
the
grass
with
jack
ogden
bending
over
him
in
a
fever
of
exultation
and
amazement
i
never
could
have
caught
him
with
a
worm
and
a
sinker
he
said
aloud
this
is
the
way
to
catch
is
he
a
big
fellow
try
some
more
grasshoppers
there
was
not
likely
to
be
another
very
near
the
hole
out
of
which
that
one
had
been
pulled
there
would
not
have
been
any
at
all
perhaps
but
for
the
prevailing
superstition
that
there
were
no
fish
there
everybody
knew
that
there
were
bullheads
suckers
perch
and
in
the
and
eels
with
now
and
then
a
pickerel
but
the
trout
were
a
profound
secret
it
was
easy
to
catch
another
big
grasshopper
but
the
young
sportsman
knew
very
well
that
he
knew
nothing
at
all
of
that
kind
of
fishing
he
had
made
his
first
cast
perfectly
because
it
was
about
the
only
way
in
which
it
could
have
been
made
and
now
he
was
so
very
nervous
and
excited
and
cautious
that
he
did
very
well
again
aided
as
before
by
the
breeze
not
in
the
same
place
but
at
a
little
distance
down
and
close
to
where
jack
captured
his
second
bait
there
was
a
crook
in
the
cocahutchie
with
a
steep
overhanging
bushy
bank
into
the
glassy
shadow
under
that
bank
the
sinkerless
line
carried
and
dropped
its
little
green
prisoner
and
there
was
a
hungry
fellow
in
there
waiting
for
foolish
grasshoppers
in
the
meadow
to
spring
too
far
and
come
down
upon
the
water
instead
of
upon
the
grass
as
the
grasshopper
alighted
on
the
water
there
was
a
rush
a
plunge
a
strong
hard
pull
and
then
jack
ogden
said
to
himself
i
heard
how
they
do
it
they
wait
and
tire
out
i
wo
be
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
he
get
away
if
i
am
that
is
probably
what
the
fish
would
have
done
for
he
was
a
fish
with
what
army
men
call
tactics
he
was
able
to
pull
very
hard
and
he
was
also
wise
enough
to
rush
in
under
the
bank
and
to
sulkily
stay
there
feels
as
if
i
hooked
a
snag
said
jack
may
be
i
lost
the
fish
and
he
hitched
me
into
a
eel
of
some
kind
steady
no
i
must
pull
harder
than
the
fish
he
was
breathless
but
not
with
any
exertion
that
he
was
making
his
hat
fell
off
upon
the
grass
as
he
leaned
forward
through
the
alder
bushes
and
his
sandy
hair
was
tangled
for
a
moment
in
some
stubby
twigs
he
loosened
his
head
still
holding
firmly
his
bent
and
straining
rod
one
step
farther
a
slip
of
his
left
foot
an
unsuccessful
grasp
at
a
bush
and
then
jack
went
over
and
down
into
a
pool
deeper
than
he
had
thought
the
cocahutchie
afforded
so
near
crofield
there
was
a
very
fine
splash
as
the
grasshopper
went
under
and
there
was
a
coughing
and
spluttering
a
moment
afterward
when
his
eager
excited
anxious
face
came
up
again
he
could
swim
extremely
well
and
he
was
not
thinking
of
his
ducking
only
of
his
game
i
hope
i
have
lost
him
he
exclaimed
as
he
tried
to
pull
upon
the
line
it
did
not
tug
at
all
just
then
for
the
fish
on
the
hook
had
been
rudely
startled
out
from
under
the
bank
and
was
on
his
way
up
the
cocahutchie
with
the
hook
in
his
mouth
there
he
is
i
got
him
yet
glad
i
can
swim
cried
jack
and
it
did
seem
as
if
he
and
this
fish
were
very
well
matched
except
that
jack
had
to
give
one
of
his
hands
to
the
rod
while
his
captive
could
use
every
fin
down
stream
floated
jack
passing
the
rod
back
through
his
hands
until
he
could
grasp
the
line
and
all
the
while
the
fish
was
darting
madly
about
to
get
away
there
i
touched
bottom
now
for
him
here
he
comes
i
draw
him
ashore
easy
that
it
hurrah
biggest
fish
ever
was
caught
in
the
cocahutchie
that
might
or
might
not
be
so
but
jack
ogden
had
a
trout
flopping
angrily
upon
the
grass
at
his
feet
i
know
how
to
do
it
now
he
almost
shouted
i
can
catch
i
wo
let
anybody
else
know
how
it
done
either
he
had
learned
something
no
doubt
but
he
had
not
learned
how
to
make
a
large
fish
out
of
a
small
one
all
the
rest
of
that
afternoon
he
caught
grasshoppers
and
cast
them
daintily
into
what
seemed
to
be
good
places
but
he
did
not
have
another
occasion
to
tumble
in
when
at
last
he
was
tired
out
and
decided
to
go
home
he
had
a
dozen
more
of
trout
not
one
of
them
weighing
over
six
ounces
with
a
pair
of
very
good
yellow
perch
one
very
large
perch
a
sucker
and
three
bullheads
that
bit
when
his
bait
happened
to
sink
to
the
bottom
without
any
lead
to
help
it
take
it
all
in
all
it
was
a
great
string
of
fish
to
be
caught
on
a
saturday
afternoon
when
all
that
the
crofield
sportsmen
around
the
could
show
was
six
bullheads
a
dozen
small
perch
a
lot
of
not
much
larger
than
dollars
five
small
eels
and
a
very
vicious
jack
stood
for
a
moment
looking
down
at
the
results
of
his
experiment
in
he
felt
really
as
if
he
could
not
more
than
half
believe
it
fishing
does
pay
he
said
it
does
pay
cash
any
way
there
is
anything
around
crofield
that
does
pay
well
it
must
be
time
for
me
to
go
home
chapter
iii
i
am
only
a
girl
jack
was
dry
enough
but
anybody
could
see
that
he
had
had
a
ducking
when
he
marched
down
the
main
street
he
was
carrying
his
prizes
in
two
strings
one
in
each
hand
and
he
was
looking
and
feeling
taller
than
he
ever
felt
before
it
was
just
the
right
hour
to
meet
people
and
he
had
to
answer
curious
questions
from
some
women
and
from
twice
as
many
men
and
from
three
times
as
many
boys
all
the
way
from
above
the
green
where
he
came
out
into
the
street
down
to
the
front
of
the
washington
hotel
yes
i
caught
all
in
the
cocahutchie
he
had
had
to
say
that
any
number
of
times
and
he
had
also
explained
apparently
without
trying
to
conceal
anything
i
had
to
swim
for
caught
all
under
water
those
big
speckled
fellows
are
trout
they
pulled
me
clean
under

a
dozen
inquiring
boys

going
there

had
to
come
to
a
halt

jack
once
more
i
caught
under
water

just
what
i
looking
for

livermore
rubbing
his
sides
while
nearly
a
dozen
men
crowded
around
to
admire
and
to
guess
at
the
weights
traout
at

deacon

closely
at
the

a
dollar
a
paound
i

some
folks

the

testily
i
spoke

pounds

is
five
pounds
and
i

dollar
for
the
small
traout
exclaimed
deacon
hawkins
he
ca
have
all
the
landlord
might
have
hesitated
even
then
but
the
excitement
was
catching
and
squire
jones
was
actually
but
slowly
taking
out
his
five
there
your
five
jack
the
big
fish
are

take
your

out
old
livermore
there

dollar
and
there
my
traout
squealed
the
deacon
i
was
just
to
saay
at
that
moment
growled
the
deep
heavy
bass
voice
of
squire
jones
too
late
said
the
landlord
he
taken
my
money
come
in
jack
come
in
and
get
yours
deacon
and
jack
walked
on
into
the
washington
house
with
six
dollars
in
his
hand
just
as
a
boy
he
knew
stuck
his
head
under
squire
jones
arm
and
shouted
jack
jack
why
did
yer
put
up
at
auction
it
took
but
a
minute
to
get
rid
of
the
very
fine
fish
he
had
sold
and
then
the
uncommonly
successful
angler
made
his
way
out
of
the
washington
hotel
through
the
side
door
i
do
intend
to
answer
any
more
questions
he
said
to
himself
and
all
that
crowd
is
out
there
yet
there
was
another
reason
that
he
did
not
give
for
his
perch
good
as
they
were
and
the
sucker
and
the
great
clumsy
bullheads
looked
mean
and
common
now
that
their
elegant
companions
were
gone
he
felt
almost
ashamed
of
them
until
just
as
he
reached
the
back
yard
of
his
own
home
a
tall
grimy
man
with
his
head
under
the
pump
was
vigorously
scrubbing
charcoal
and
iron
dust
from
his
face
and
hands
and
hair
jack
he
shouted
where
you
get
that
string
o
fish
best
seen
round
here
for
ever
so
long
another
voice
came
from
the
kitchen
door
and
in
half
a
second
it
seemed
to
belong
to
a
chorus
of
voices
why
jack
ogden
what
a
string
of
fish
i
caught
down
the
cocahutchie
mother
said
jack
i
caught
all
under
water
had
to
go
right
in
after
some
of
i
should
say
you
did
growled
his
father
almost
jocosely
and
then
he
and
ogden
and
aunt
melinda
and
the
children
crowded
around
to
examine
the
fish
on
the
pump
platform
jack
must
do
something
that
said
his
father
rubbing
his
face
hard
with
the
kitchen
towel
but
he
had
the
best
kind
o
luck
this
time
he
caught
a
team
of
runaway
horses
this
morning
too
said
mary
looking
proudly
at
the
fish
i
wish
i
could
do
something
worth
talking
about
but
i
only
a
girl
jack
clothes
had
not
suffered
much
from
their
ducking
mainly
because
the
checked
shirt
and
linen
trousers
of
which
his
suit
consisted
had
been
frequently
soaked
before
his
straw
hat
was
dry
for
it
had
been
lying
on
the
grass
when
he
went
into
the
water
and
so
were
his
shoes
and
stockings
which
had
been
under
the
bed
in
his
bedroom
waiting
for
sunday
it
was
not
until
the
family
was
gathered
at
the
table
that
jack
came
out
with
the
whole
tremendous
story
of
his
afternoon
sport
and
of
its
cash
results
now
i
learned
all
about
he
said
with
confidence
i
can
catch
fish
anywhere
i
have
to
go
to
fish
out
of
that
old
again
six
dollars
exclaimed
his
mother
from
behind
the
what
awful
extravagance
there
is
in
this
wicked
world
but
what
you
do
with
six
dollars
it
high
time
he
began
to
earn
something
said
the
tall
blacksmith
gloomily
it
hard
times
in
crofield
there
almost
nothing
for
him
to
do
here
that
why
i
going
somewhere
else
said
jack
with
a
sudden
burst
of
energy
and
showing
a
very
red
face
now
i
got
some
money
to
pay
my
way
i
going
to
new
york
no
you
not
said
his
father
and
then
there
was
a
silence
for
a
moment
what
on
earth
could
you
do
in
new
york
said
his
mother
staring
at
him
as
if
he
had
said
something
dreadful
she
was
not
a
small
woman
but
she
had
an
air
of
trying
to
be
larger
and
her
face
quickly
began
to
recover
its
ordinary
smile
of
hope
so
much
like
that
of
jack
she
added
before
anybody
else
could
speak
there
are
thousands
and
thousands
of
folks
there
already
well
i
suppose
you
could
get
along
there
if
they
can
it
too
full
said
her
husband
it
crofield
he
could
do
anything
in
a
city
besides
it
is
any
use
he
get
there
or
anywhere
near
there
on
six
dollars
if
he
only
could
go
somewhere
and
do
something
and
be
somebody
said
mary
staring
hard
at
her
plate
she
had
echoed
jack
thought
perfectly
that
you
molly
he
said
and
i
going
to
do
it
too
you
going
to
work
all
next
week
i
guess
said
his
father
if
there
anybody
wants
ye
all
the
money
you
earn
you
can
give
to
your
mother
you
ai
going
again
right
away
nobody
ever
caught
the
same
fish
twice
slowly
glumly
but
promptly
jack
handed
over
his
two
greenbacks
to
his
mother
but
he
only
remarked
if
i
work
for
anybody
here
they
want
me
to
take
my
pay
in
hay
they
wo
pay
cash
hay
just
as
good
said
his
father
and
then
he
changed
the
subject
and
told
his
wife
how
the
miller
had
again
urged
him
to
trade
for
the
strip
of
land
along
the
creek
above
and
below
the
bridge
it
comes
right
up
to
the
line
of
my
lot
he
said
and
to
hawkins
fence
the
whole
of
it
is
worth
as
much
as
mine
is
but
i
do
see
what
he
wants
to
trade
for
she
agreed
with
him
and
so
did
aunt
melinda
but
jack
and
mary
finished
their
suppers
and
went
out
to
the
front
door
she
stood
still
for
a
moment
with
her
hands
clasped
behind
her
looking
across
the
street
as
if
she
were
reading
the
sign
on
the
shop
the
discontented
despondent
expression
on
her
face
made
her
more
and
more
like
a
very
young
and
pretty
copy
of
her
father
i
do
care
molly
said
jack
if
they
take
away
every
cent
i
get
i
going
to
the
city
some
time
i
go
too
if
i
were
a
boy
she
said
i
got
to
stay
at
home
and
wash
dishes
and
sweep
you
can
go
right
out
and
make
your
fortune
i
read
of
lots
of
boys
that
went
away
from
home
and
worked
their
way
up
some
of
got
to
be
presidents
some
girls
amount
to
something
too
said
jack
you
been
through
the
academy
i
had
to
stop
when
i
was
twelve
and
go
to
work
in
a
store
been
in
every
store
in
crofield
they
did
pay
me
a
cent
in
cash
but
i
learned
the
grocery
business
and
the
business
and
all
about
crockery
that
was
something
i
could
keep
a
store
some
of
the
stores
in
new
york
hold
all
the
stores
in
crofield
some
of
are
owned
and
run
by
women
too
said
mary
but
no
use
of
my
thinking
of
any
such
thing
before
he
could
tell
her
what
he
thought
about
it
her
mother
called
her
in
and
then
he
too
stood
still
and
seemed
to
study
the
sign
over
the
door
of
the
i
do
it
he
exclaimed
at
last
shaking
his
fist
at
the
sign
it
is
the
end
of
july
yet
and
i
going
to
get
to
the
city
before
christmas
you
see
i
do
after
mary
ogden
left
him
and
went
in
jack
walked
down
to
the
bridge
it
seemed
as
if
the
cocahutchie
had
a
special
attraction
for
him
now
that
he
knew
what
might
be
in
it
there
were
three
boys
leaning
over
the
rail
on
the
lower
side
of
the
bridge
and
four
on
the
upper
side
and
all
were
fishing
jack
did
not
know
and
they
did
not
tell
him
that
all
their
hooks
were
baited
with
flies
of
one
kind
or
another
instead
of
worms
two
had
grasshoppers
and
one
had
a
big
bumblebee
and
they
were
after
such
trout
as
jack
ogden
had
caught
and
been
paid
so
much
money
for
one
told
another
that
jack
had
five
dollars
apiece
for
those
fish
and
that
even
the
bullheads
were
so
heavy
it
tired
him
to
carry
them
home
jack
did
not
go
upon
the
bridge
he
strolled
down
along
the
edge
illustration
the
water
it
all
sand
and
gravel
he
said
but
i
hate
to
leave
it
it
was
curious
but
not
until
that
very
moment
had
he
been
at
all
aware
of
any
real
affection
for
crofield
he
was
only
dimly
aware
of
it
then
and
he
forgot
it
all
to
answer
a
hail
from
two
men
under
the
clump
of
giant
trees
which
had
so
nearly
wrecked
the
miller
wagon
the
men
had
been
looking
up
at
the
trees
and
jack
heard
part
of
what
they
said
about
them
as
he
came
near
they
had
called
him
to
talk
about
his
but
they
had
aroused
his
curiosity
upon
another
subject
bannerman
he
said
as
soon
as
he
had
an
opportunity
between
fish
questions
did
you
say
you
give
a
hundred
dollars
for
those
trees
just
as
they
stand
what
are
they
good
for
jack
exclaimed
the
man
he
spoke
to
do
you
tell
anybody
i
said
that
you
wo
will
you
come
now
did
i
treat
you
well
while
you
were
in
my
shop
yes
you
did
said
jack
but
you
kept
me
there
only
four
months
what
are
those
trees
good
for
you
do
use
anything
but
pine
why
jack
said
bannerman
it
is
for
carpenter
work
three
of
are
curly
maples
and
that
one
there
the
biggest
cleanest
old
cherry
they
for
jack
but
you
said
you
would
tell
i
wo
tell
said
jack
old
hammond
owns
i
stayed
in
your
shop
just
long
enough
to
learn
the
carpenter
trade
i
did
learn
do
you
want
me
again
not
just
now
jack
but
sam
and
i
got
a
bargain
coming
with
hammond
and
he
owes
us
some
now
and
you
must
put
in
and
spile
the
trade
for
us
i
do
ye
a
good
turn
some
day
do
you
tell
jack
promised
again
and
the
carpenters
walked
away
leaving
him
looking
up
at
the
trees
and
thinking
how
it
would
seem
to
see
them
topple
over
and
come
crashing
down
into
the
cocahutchie
to
be
made
up
into
chairs
and
tables
just
as
long
as
he
could
remember
anything
he
had
seen
the
old
trees
standing
guard
there
summer
and
winter
leafy
or
bare
and
they
were
like
old
friends
to
him
i
go
home
he
said
at
last
there
has
been
a
house
built
in
crofield
for
years
and
years
it
is
any
kind
of
place
for
carpentering
or
for
anything
else
that
i
know
how
to
do
then
he
took
a
long
silent
thoughtful
look
up
stream
and
another
down
stream
and
instead
of
the
gravel
and
bushes
and
grass
in
one
direction
and
the
rickety
bridge
and
the
slippery
dam
and
the
dingy
old
red
mill
in
the
other
direction
he
seemed
to
see
a
vision
of
great
buildings
and
streets
and
crowds
of
busy
men
while
the
swishing
ripple
of
the
cocahutchie
changed
into
the
rush
and
roar
of
the
great
city
he
was
setting
his
heart
upon
he
gave
it
up
for
that
evening
and
went
home
and
went
to
bed
but
even
then
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
he
were
about
to
let
go
of
something
and
take
hold
of
something
else
i
done
that
often
enough
he
said
to
himself
i
have
to
leave
the
blacksmith
trade
now
but
i
kind
o
glad
i
learned
it
glad
i
did
have
my
shoes
on
when
i
went
into
the
water
though
soaking
is
good
for
that
kind
of
shoes
do
i
know
i
worked
in
every
in
crofield
some
did
get
any
pay
except
in
shoes
but
then
i
learned
the
trade
and
that
something
i
never
had
an
opportunity
to
stay
long
in
any
one
place
but
i
could
stay
in
the
city
then
another
kind
of
dreaming
set
in
and
the
next
thing
he
knew
it
was
sunday
morning
with
a
promise
of
a
sunny
sultry
sleepy
kind
of
day
it
was
not
easy
for
the
ogden
family
to
shut
out
all
talk
about
fishing
while
they
were
eating
jack
fish
for
breakfast
but
they
avoided
the
subject
until
jack
went
to
dress
jack
was
quite
another
boy
by
the
time
he
was
ready
for
church
he
was
skillful
with
the
and
from
his
shoes
upward
he
was
a
surprise
you
do
look
well
said
mary
as
he
and
she
were
on
their
way
to
church
but
how
you
did
look
when
you
came
home
last
night
there
was
little
opportunity
for
conversation
for
the
walk
before
the
ogden
family
from
their
gate
to
the
was
not
long
the
little
processions
toward
the
village
green
did
not
divide
fairly
after
reaching
there
that
morning
the
larger
part
of
each
aimed
itself
at
the
middle
of
the
green
although
the
building
there
was
no
larger
than
either
of
the
two
that
stood
at
its
right
and
left
everybody
coming
to
hear
elder
holloway
said
jack
they
say
it
takes
a
fellow
a
good
while
to
learn
how
to
preach
ogden
and
aunt
melinda
led
their
part
of
the
procession
and
jack
and
his
father
followed
them
in
there
were
ten
ogdens
and
the
family
pew
held
six
just
as
they
were
going
in
some
one
asked
mary
to
go
into
the
choir
little
sally
nestled
in
her
mother
lap
bob
and
jim
were
small
and
thin
and
only
counted
for
one
bessie
and
sue
went
in
and
so
did
their
father
and
then
jack
remarked
i
crowded
out
father
i
find
a
place
somewhere
there
is
any
said
the
blacksmith
every
place
is
full
he
shook
his
head
until
the
points
of
his
sunday
collar
scratched
him
but
off
went
jack
and
that
was
the
last
that
was
seen
of
him
until
they
were
all
at
home
again
mary
ogden
had
her
reasons
for
not
expecting
to
sing
in
the
choir
that
day
but
she
went
when
sent
for
the
gallery
was
what
jack
called
a
coop
and
would
hold
just
eighteen
persons
squeezed
in
usually
it
was
only
half
full
but
on
a
great
day
what
was
called
the
old
choir
was
sure
to
turn
out
there
were
no
girls
nor
boys
in
the
old
choir
there
had
been
three
seats
yet
to
fill
when
mary
was
sent
for
but
miss
glidden
and
miss
roberts
and
her
elder
sister
from
mertonville
came
in
just
then
so
when
mary
reached
the
gallery
miss
glidden
leaned
over
smiled
and
said
very
benevolently
you
will
not
be
needed
mary
ogden
the
choir
is
filled
the
organ
began
to
play
at
that
moment
somewhat
as
if
it
had
lost
its
temper
simmons
the
whenever
he
could
get
there
flushed
and
seemed
about
to
say
something
he
was
the
one
who
had
sent
for
mary
and
it
was
said
that
he
had
been
heard
to
say
that
it
would
be
good
to
have
some
music
outside
of
the
organ
before
he
could
speak
however
mary
was
downstairs
again
seats
were
offered
her
in
several
of
the
back
pews
and
she
took
one
under
the
gallery
she
might
as
well
have
had
a
behind
her
arranged
so
as
to
send
her
voice
right
at
the
pulpit
perhaps
her
temper
was
a
little
aroused
and
she
did
not
know
how
very
full
her
voice
was
when
she
began
the
first
hymn
all
were
singing
and
they
could
hear
the
organ
and
the
choir
but
through
over
and
above
them
all
sounded
the
clear
ringing
notes
of
mary
ogden
soprano
elder
holloway
sitting
in
the
pulpit
put
up
a
hand
to
one
ear
as
men
do
and
sat
up
straight
looking
as
if
he
was
hearing
some
good
news
he
said
afterward
that
it
helped
him
preach
but
then
mary
did
not
know
it
when
all
the
services
were
over
she
slipped
out
into
the
vestibule
to
wait
for
the
rest
she
stood
there
when
miss
glidden
came
downstairs
the
portly
lady
was
trying
her
best
to
smile
and
look
sweet
splendid
sermon
mary
ogden
said
she
i
hope
you
profit
by
it
i
ask
you
to
take
my
class
this
afternoon
elder
going
to
inspect
the
school
i
be
glad
to
have
you
present
though
as
one
of
my
best
scholars
mary
went
home
as
quickly
as
she
could
and
the
first
remark
she
made
was
to
aunt
melinda
class
she
said
why
she
has
been
there
in
six
weeks
she
had
only
four
in
it
when
she
left
and
there
a
dozen
now
the
ogden
procession
homeward
had
been
longer
than
when
it
went
to
church
jack
understood
the
matter
the
moment
he
came
into
the
for
both
extra
leaves
had
been
put
into
the
there
company
he
said
aloud
you
could
stretch
that
table
any
farther
unless
you
stretched
the
room
jack
said
his
mother
you
must
come
afterward
you
can
help
mary
wait
on
the
table
jack
was
as
hungry
as
a
young
pickerel
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
and
he
tried
to
reply
cheerfully
i
getting
used
to
being
crowded
out
i
can
stand
it
where
you
sit
in
church
asked
his
mother
out
on
the
stoop
said
jack
but
i
did
go
till
after
i
sat
in
five
pews
inside
sorry
you
missed
the
sermon
said
his
mother
it
was
about
jerusalem
i
heard
him
said
jack
you
could
hear
him
halfway
across
the
green
it
kept
me
thinking
about
the
city
all
the
while
i
going
somehow
just
then
the
talk
was
interrupted
by
the
others
who
came
in
from
the
parlor
i
declare
ogden
said
the
editor
we
shall
quite
fill
your
table
i
glad
i
came
though
i
print
a
full
report
of
it
all
in
the
mertonville
that
murdoch
the
editor
said
jack
to
himself
that
his
paper
ours
was
a
but
it
there
no
room
for
a
newspaper
in
crofield
said
the
blacksmith
they
tried
one
and
it
lasted
six
months
and
my
son
worked
on
it
all
the
time
it
ran
murdoch
turned
and
looked
inquisitively
at
jack
through
a
huge
pair
of
glasses
that
so
said
jack
i
learned
to
set
type
and
helped
edit
the
paper
molly
and
i
did
all
the
clipping
and
most
of
the
writing
one
week
did
you
said
the
editor
emphatically
then
you
did
well
i
remember
there
was
one
strong
number
molly
said
jack
as
soon
as
they
were
out
in
the
kitchen
five
besides
our
family
they
wo
leave
a
thing
for
us
there
hardly
enough
for
them
even
said
mary
what
we
do
we
can
cook
said
jack
with
energy
we
cook
while
eating
you
know
how
and
so
do
i
you
can
wait
on
table
as
well
as
i
can
said
mary
there
was
something
cronyish
and
also
in
the
way
jack
and
molly
boiled
eggs
and
toasted
bread
and
fried
bacon
and
made
coffee
and
took
swift
turns
at
eating
and
at
waiting
on
the
table
the
editor
of
the
heard
the
whole
of
the
trout
item
and
about
the
runaway
and
told
jack
to
send
him
the
next
big
trout
he
caught
there
was
another
item
of
news
that
was
soon
to
be
ready
for
murdoch
jack
was
conscious
of
a
restless
excited
state
of
mind
and
mary
said
things
that
made
him
worse
you
want
to
get
somewhere
else
as
badly
as
i
do
he
remarked
just
as
they
came
back
from
taking
in
the
pies
to
the
i
feel
sometimes
as
if
i
could
fly
exclaimed
mary
jack
walked
out
through
the
hall
to
the
front
door
and
stood
there
thinking
with
a
egg
in
one
hand
and
a
piece
of
toast
in
the
other
the
street
he
looked
into
was
silent
and
deserted
from
the
bridge
to
the
hotel
corner
he
looked
down
to
the
creek
for
a
moment
and
then
he
looked
the
other
way
i
believe
molly
could
do
anything
i
could
do
he
said
to
himself
unless
it
was
catching
a
runaway
team
she
could
caught
that
wagon
hullo
what
that
jingo
the
hotel
cook
must
have
made
a
regular
bonfire
to
fry
my
trout
he
wheeled
as
he
spoke
and
dashed
back
through
the
house
shouting
father
the
washington
hotel
on
fire
over
the
kitchen
ladder
jack
rope
bucket
cried
the
tall
blacksmith
coolly
rising
from
the
table
and
following
as
for
the
rest
beginning
with
the
editor
of
the
it
was
almost
as
if
they
had
been
told
that
they
were
themselves
on
fire
even
aunt
melinda
exclaimed
he
ought
to
have
told
us
more
about
it
where
is
it
how
it
ever
catch
oh
dear
me
it
the
oldest
part
of
the
hotel
it
as
dry
as
a
bone
and
it
burn
like
tinder
everybody
else
was
saying
something
as
all
jumped
and
ran
but
jack
and
his
father
were
silent
ladder
rope
were
caught
up
as
if
they
were
going
to
work
in
the
shop
but
the
moment
they
were
in
the
street
again
it
seemed
as
if
john
ogden
lungs
must
be
as
deep
as
the
bellows
of
his
forge
fire
fire
fire
his
full
resonant
voice
sent
out
the
sudden
warning
illustration
the
fire
fire
fire
shouted
jack
and
every
child
of
the
ogden
family
except
mary
echoed
with
such
voice
as
belonged
to
each
through
the
wide
gate
of
the
hotel
dashed
the
blacksmith
and
his
son
with
their
ladder
at
the
moment
when
livermore
came
out
at
the
kitchen
door
wiping
a
plate
all
the
other
inmates
of
the
hotel
were
gathered
around
the
long
table
in
the
and
they
were
too
busy
with
pie
and
different
kinds
of
pudding
to
notice
anything
outdoors
where
is
the
fire
mr
ogden
she
said
in
a
fatigued
tone
the
fire
on
your
roof
close
to
the
chimney
said
the
blacksmith
may
be
we
can
put
it
out
if
we
quick
about
it
call
everybody
to
hand
up
water
up
went
a
pair
of
hands
and
out
came
a
great
scream
another
shrill
scream
and
another
followed
in
quick
succession
and
the
plate
she
had
held
fell
and
was
shivered
into
fragments
on
the
stone
yelled
the
hotel
cook
the
house
is
the
doors
to
of
the
hotel
were
open
and
in
a
second
more
her
cry
was
taken
up
by
voices
that
sent
the
substance
of
it
ringing
through
the
plates
fell
from
the
hands
of
waiters
were
upset
chairs
were
overturned
all
manner
of
voices
caught
up
the
alarm
it
would
have
been
a
very
serious
matter
but
for
the
promptness
of
jack
ogden
and
his
very
cool
father
the
ladder
was
planted
and
climbed
there
was
a
quick
dash
along
the
low
but
roof
of
the
kitchen
addition
of
the
hotel
the
rope
was
put
around
jack
waist
and
then
he
was
able
safely
to
use
both
hands
in
pouring
water
from
the
pails
around
the
foot
of
the
chimney
other
feet
came
fast
to
the
foot
of
the
ladder
more
went
tramping
into
the
rooms
under
the
roof
the
pumps
in
the
kitchen
and
in
the
were
worked
with
frantic
energy
pail
after
pail
was
carried
upstairs
and
up
the
ladder
water
was
thrown
in
all
directions
nothing
was
left
undone
that
could
be
done
and
a
great
many
things
were
done
that
seemed
hardly
possible
hot
work
jack
said
his
father
it
on
us
glad
all
about
got
through
dinner
though
livermore
tells
me
he
insured
i
can
stand
it
said
jack
they
have
steam
in
the
city
though
oh
but
would
i
like
to
see
one
at
work
once
like
to
be
a
fireman
that
about
what
you
are
just
now
said
his
father
and
then
he
turned
toward
the
ladder
and
shouted
hurry
up
that
water
quick
now
bring
an
axe
i
want
to
smash
the
roof
in
bear
it
jack
we
got
to
beat
this
fire
the
main
building
of
the
washington
hotel
was
long
rather
than
high
with
an
open
veranda
along
main
street
the
third
story
was
mainly
steep
roof
and
and
the
kitchen
addition
had
only
a
story
and
a
half
it
was
an
easy
building
to
get
into
or
out
of
very
quickly
after
the
cry
of
fire
was
heard
the
only
people
in
it
upstairs
were
such
of
the
guests
as
had
the
pluck
to
go
and
pack
their
trunks
the
lower
floor
was
very
well
crowded
and
it
was
almost
a
relief
to
the
men
actually
at
work
as
firemen
that
so
many
other
men
kept
well
back
because
they
were
in
their
clothes
everybody
was
inclined
to
praise
jack
ogden
and
his
father
who
were
making
so
brave
a
fight
on
the
roof
within
only
a
few
feet
of
the
smoke
and
blaze
it
was
heroic
to
look
a
burning
house
straight
in
the
face
and
conquer
it
during
fully
half
an
hour
there
seemed
to
be
doubt
about
the
victory
but
the
pails
of
water
came
up
rapidly
a
line
of
men
and
boys
along
the
roof
conveyed
them
to
the
hands
of
jack
and
the
fire
had
a
damp
time
of
it
with
no
wind
to
help
the
blacksmith
had
chopped
a
hole
in
the
roof
and
tom
and
sam
bannerman
the
carpenters
were
already
calculating
what
they
would
charge
old
livermore
to
put
the
addition
in
order
again
there
jack
said
his
father
at
last
we
can
quit
now
the
under
somebody
else
can
take
a
turn
it
the
hottest
kind
of
work
come
along
we
done
our
share
and
a
little
more
too
jack
had
just
swallowed
a
puff
of
smoke
but
as
soon
as
he
could
stop
coughing
he
said
i
had
enough
i
coming
other
people
seemed
to
agree
with
them
but
there
would
have
been
less
said
about
it
if
little
joe
hawkins
had
not
called
out
three
cheers
for
the
ogdens
the
cheers
were
given
as
the
two
volunteer
firemen
came
down
the
ladder
but
there
were
no
speeches
made
in
reply
jack
hurried
back
home
at
once
but
his
father
had
to
stop
and
talk
with
the
bannermans
and
old
hammond
the
miller
jack
said
his
mother
looking
at
him
proudly
from
head
to
foot
you
always
doing
something
or
other
we
were
looking
at
you
all
the
while
he
has
hurt
his
sunday
clothes
a
bit
said
aunt
melinda
but
there
was
quite
a
crowd
around
the
gate
and
she
did
not
hug
him
he
was
a
little
damp
his
face
was
smoky
his
was
wilted
and
his
shoes
would
require
a
little
work
but
otherwise
he
was
none
the
worse
jack
went
into
the
house
saying
that
he
must
brush
his
clothes
but
really
it
was
because
he
wished
to
get
away
he
did
not
care
to
talk
to
anybody
i
never
felt
so
in
all
my
life
as
i
did
when
sitting
on
that
roof
fighting
that
fire
he
said
aloud
as
he
went
upstairs
and
he
did
not
know
even
then
how
excited
he
had
been
silent
and
cool
as
he
had
seemed
in
that
short
time
he
had
dreamed
of
more
cities
than
he
was
ever
likely
to
see
and
of
doing
more
great
things
than
he
could
ever
possibly
do
and
when
he
came
down
the
ladder
he
felt
older
than
when
he
went
up
he
had
no
idea
that
much
the
same
thoughts
had
come
to
mary
nor
did
he
know
how
fully
she
believed
that
he
could
do
anything
and
that
she
was
as
capable
as
he
father
splendid
too
she
said
but
then
he
never
had
any
chance
here
and
mother
did
either
jack
ought
to
have
a
chance
chapter
iv
captain
mary
murdoch
had
stood
on
the
main
street
corner
taking
notes
for
the
but
now
he
came
back
to
say
the
fire
was
out
and
it
was
nearly
time
for
it
seemed
strange
to
have
just
after
a
fire
but
the
ogden
family
and
its
visitors
at
once
made
ready
it
was
a
quarterly
meeting
with
general
exercises
and
singing
and
a
review
of
the
quarter
lessons
the
church
was
full
by
the
hour
for
opening
and
the
school
had
a
very
prosperous
look
elder
holloway
and
murdoch
and
two
other
important
men
sat
in
the
pulpit
and
joab
spokes
the
superintendent
stood
in
front
of
them
to
conduct
the
exercises
the
elder
seemed
to
be
glancing
benevolently
around
the
room
through
his
spectacles
but
there
were
some
things
there
which
could
be
seen
without
glasses
and
he
must
have
seen
those
also
miss
glidden
looked
particularly
well
and
very
stately
as
she
sat
in
the
pew
in
front
of
her
class
if
it
were
hers
with
mary
ogden
her
first
words
on
coming
in
to
take
command
had
been
mary
dear
do
go
i
really
wish
you
to
stay
you
may
be
of
assistance
mary
flushed
a
little
but
she
said
nothing
in
reply
she
remained
and
she
certainly
did
assist
for
the
girls
looked
at
her
almost
all
the
while
and
miss
glidden
had
no
trouble
whatever
and
nothing
to
do
but
to
look
pleased
and
beaming
and
dignified
the
elder
it
was
noticed
seemed
to
feel
special
interest
in
the
part
taken
in
the
exercises
by
the
class
with
two
teachers
one
for
show
and
one
for
work
he
even
seemed
to
see
something
comical
in
the
situation
and
there
was
positive
admiration
in
a
remark
he
made
to
murdoch
she
a
true
teacher
there
really
only
one
teacher
to
that
class
she
must
have
been
born
with
a
knack
for
it
elder
holloway
with
all
his
years
and
experience
had
not
understood
the
case
of
miss
glidden
class
more
perfectly
than
had
one
young
observer
at
the
other
end
of
the
church
jack
ogden
could
not
see
so
well
as
those
great
men
in
the
pulpit
but
then
he
could
hear
much
and
surmise
the
rest
all
those
girls
will
stand
by
molly
he
said
to
himself
i
hope
it
wo
be
long
before
school
dismissed
he
added
he
had
reasons
for
this
hope
he
was
a
little
late
through
lingering
to
take
a
curious
look
at
what
was
left
of
the
fire
the
street
had
a
littered
look
the
barns
and
stables
were
wide
open
and
deserted
for
the
horses
had
been
led
to
places
of
safety
there
seemed
to
be
an
impression
that
the
hotel
was
half
destroyed
but
the
damage
had
not
been
very
great
a
faint
thin
film
of
blue
was
eddying
along
the
ridgepole
of
the
kitchen
addition
jack
noticed
it
but
did
not
know
what
it
meant
a
more
practiced
observer
would
have
known
that
hidden
from
sight
buried
in
the
punk
of
the
timber
was
a
vicious
spark
of
fire
stealthily
eating
its
way
through
the
punk
of
the
resinous
pine
jack
paid
little
attention
to
the
tiny
but
he
was
compelled
to
pay
some
attention
to
the
weather
it
had
been
hot
from
sunrise
until
noon
and
the
air
had
grown
heavier
since
i
know
what
that
haze
means
said
jack
to
himself
as
he
looked
toward
the
cocahutchie
there
a
thunderstorm
coming
by
and
by
and
nobody
knows
just
when
i
be
on
the
lookout
for
it
for
this
reason
he
was
glad
that
he
was
compelled
to
find
a
seat
not
far
from
the
door
of
the
church
twice
he
went
out
to
look
at
the
sky
and
the
second
time
he
saw
banks
of
clouds
forming
on
the
northwestern
horizon
returning
he
said
to
several
of
the
boys
near
the
vestibule
you
just
time
to
get
home
if
you
do
want
a
ducking
each
boy
passed
along
the
warning
and
when
the
school
stood
up
to
sing
the
last
hymn
even
the
girls
and
the
older
people
knew
of
the
coming
storm
there
was
a
brief
silence
before
the
first
note
of
the
organ
and
through
that
silence
nearly
everybody
could
catch
the
shrill
squeak
in
which
little
joe
hawkins
tried
to
speak
very
low
and
secretly
deakin
cobb
we
want
to
git
aout
we
just
time
to
git
home
if
we
do
want
a
duckin
the
hymn
started
raggedly
and
in
a
wrong
pitch
and
just
then
the
great
room
grew
suddenly
darker
and
there
was
a
low
rumble
of
thunder
mary
ogden
exclaimed
miss
glidden
what
are
you
doing
they
go
yet
mary
was
singing
as
loudly
and
correctly
as
usual
but
she
was
out
in
the
aisle
and
the
girls
of
that
class
were
promptly
obeying
the
motion
of
hand
and
head
with
which
she
summoned
them
to
walk
out
of
the
church
elder
holloway
may
have
been
only
keeping
time
when
he
nodded
his
head
but
he
was
looking
at
miss
glidden
class
so
was
miss
glidden
in
a
bewildered
way
as
if
she
like
little
were
losing
her
sheep
mary
was
following
a
strong
and
sudden
impulse
nevertheless
by
the
time
that
class
was
out
of
its
pews
the
next
caught
the
idea
and
believed
it
a
prudent
thing
to
do
they
followed
in
good
order
singing
as
they
went
the
girls
out
first
then
the
boys
said
elder
holloway
between
two
stanzas
one
class
at
a
time
no
hurry
darker
grew
the
air
jack
out
in
front
of
the
church
was
watching
the
blackest
cloud
he
had
ever
seen
as
it
came
sweeping
across
the
sky
the
people
walked
out
calmly
enough
but
all
stopped
singing
at
the
door
and
ran
their
best
run
molly
run
for
home
shouted
jack
seeing
mary
coming
going
to
be
an
awful
storm
illustration
run
for
home
inside
the
church
there
was
much
hesitation
for
a
moment
but
miss
glidden
followed
her
class
without
delay
and
all
the
rest
followed
as
fast
as
they
could
and
were
out
in
half
the
usual
time
joe
hawkins
heard
jack
words
to
molly
run
boys
he
echoed
cut
for
home
there
a
fearful
storm
coming
he
was
right
great
drops
were
already
falling
now
and
then
and
there
was
promise
of
a
torrent
to
follow
i
do
want
to
spoil
these
clothes
said
jack
uneasily
i
need
these
to
wear
in
the
city
the
storm
is
here
yet
though
wait
a
minute
he
was
holding
his
hat
on
and
looking
up
at
the
steeple
when
he
said
that
it
was
a
very
old
wooden
steeple
tall
slender
and
somewhat
rheumatic
and
he
knew
there
must
be
more
wind
up
so
high
than
there
was
nearer
the
ground
it
swinging
he
said
suddenly
i
can
see
it
bend
glad
they
all
getting
out
there
come
elder
holloway
and
murdoch
see
the
elder
run
i
hope
he
wo
try
to
get
to
hawkins
he
better
run
for
our
house
that
was
precisely
the
counsel
given
the
good
man
by
the
editor
and
the
elder
said
i
like
to
go
there
i
like
to
see
that
clever
girl
again
come
murdoch
no
time
to
lose
the
blast
was
now
coming
lower
and
the
gloom
was
deepening
flash
rattle
boom
crash
came
a
glitter
of
lightning
and
a
great
peal
of
thunder
here
it
is
cried
jack
if
it
is
a
dry
blast
it
was
something
like
the
first
hot
breath
of
a
hurricane
to
and
fro
swung
the
tottering
old
steeple
for
a
moment
and
then
there
was
another
crash
a
loud
grinding
splintering
roaring
crash
as
the
spire
reeled
heavily
down
lengthwise
through
the
shattered
roof
of
the
except
for
mary
ogden
cleverness
the
ruins
might
have
fallen
upon
the
crowded
jack
turned
and
ran
for
home
he
was
a
good
runner
but
he
only
just
escaped
the
deluge
following
that
thunderbolt
jack
turned
upon
reaching
the
house
and
as
he
looked
back
he
uttered
a
loud
exclamation
and
out
from
the
house
rushed
all
the
people
who
were
gathered
there
jingo
jack
shouted
the
old
hotel
gone
sure
this
time
the
burrowing
spark
had
smoldered
slowly
along
until
it
felt
the
first
fanning
of
the
rising
gale
in
another
minute
it
flared
as
if
under
a
blowpipe
and
soon
a
fierce
sheet
of
flame
came
bursting
through
the
roof
down
poured
the
rain
but
the
hottest
of
that
blaze
was
roofed
over
and
the
fire
had
its
own
way
with
the
empty
addition
we
could
help
if
we
should
try
exclaimed
ogden
i
put
on
my
old
clothes
any
way
said
jack
nobody
knows
coming
i
will
too
said
his
father
jack
paused
a
moment
and
said
from
the
foot
of
the
stairs
the
steeple
down
right
through
the
it
has
smashed
the
whole
church
the
sight
of
the
fire
had
made
him
withhold
that
news
for
a
minute
but
now
for
another
minute
the
fire
was
almost
forgotten
elder
holloway
began
to
say
something
in
praise
of
mary
ogden
about
her
leading
out
the
class
but
she
darted
away
let
me
get
by
jack
she
said
let
me
pass
please
they
all
would
have
been
killed
if
they
had
waited
but
i
was
thinking
only
of
my
class
and
the
rain
she
ran
and
jack
followed
then
the
elder
made
a
number
of
improving
remarks
about
discipline
and
presence
of
mind
and
the
natural
fitness
of
some
people
for
doing
the
right
thing
in
an
emergency
he
might
have
said
more
but
all
were
drawn
to
the
windows
to
watch
the
strife
between
the
fire
and
the
rain
the
fierce
wind
drove
the
smoke
through
the
building
compelling
the
landlord
and
his
wife
to
escape
as
best
they
could
and
for
the
time
being
the
victory
seemed
to
be
with
the
fire
seems
to
me
said
the
blacksmith
somberly
as
if
crofield
was
going
to
pieces
this
is
the
worst
storm
we
ever
had
the
is
gone
and
the
hotel
going
mary
at
her
window
was
looking
out
in
silence
but
her
face
was
bright
rather
than
gloomy
even
if
she
was
only
a
girl
she
had
found
an
opportunity
for
once
and
she
had
not
proved
unequal
to
it
chapter
jack
ogden
ride
jack
needed
only
a
few
minutes
to
put
on
the
suit
he
had
worn
when
fishing
there
now
he
said
if
there
going
to
be
a
big
flood
in
the
creek
i
going
down
to
see
it
rain
or
no
rain
there
no
telling
how
high
it
rise
if
this
pour
keeps
on
long
enough
it
rattles
on
the
roof
like
buckshot
that
the
end
of
the
old
tavern
said
jack
to
mary
as
he
stood
in
the
front
room
looking
out
he
was
barefooted
and
had
come
so
silently
that
she
was
startled
jack
she
exclaimed
turning
around
they
might
have
all
been
killed
when
the
steeple
came
down
i
heard
what
joe
hawkins
said
and
i
led
out
the
class
good
for
joe
said
jack
we
need
a
new
any
way
i
heard
the
elder
say
so
less
steeple
next
time
and
more
church
i
like
to
see
a
real
big
church
said
mary
a
city
church

to
go
to
the
city
as
much
as
i
would
said
jack
yes
i
would
she
replied
emphatically
just
you

there
and
come
afterward
if
i
can
i
been
studying
twice
as
hard
since
i
left
the
academy
but
i
do
know
why
i
know
it
said
jack
but
i
had
no
time
for
books
jack
molly
the
voice
of
aunt
melinda
came
up
the
stairway
are
you
ever
coming
what
will
the
elder
say
to
my
coming
down
barefoot
said
jack
but
i
do
want
shoes
if
i
going
out
into
the
mud
he
wo
care
at
such
a
time
as
this
said
mary
let
go
it
was
not
yet
but
it
was
almost
dark
enough
to
light
the
lamps
jack
felt
better
satisfied
about
his
appearance
when
he
found
how
dark
and
shadowy
the
parlor
was
and
he
felt
still
better
when
he
saw
his
father
dressed
as
if
he
were
going
over
to
work
at
the
forge
all
but
the
leather
apron
the
elder
did
not
seem
disturbed
he
and
murdoch
were
talking
about
all
sorts
of
great
disasters
and
mary
did
not
know
just
when
she
was
drawn
into
the
talk
or
how
she
came
to
acknowledge
having
read
about
so
many
different
things
all
over
the
world
jack
whispered
his
mother
at
last
you
have
to
go
to
the
barn
and
gather
eggs
or
we
have
enough
for
supper
i
bring
the
eggs
if
i
do
get
drowned
before
i
get
back
said
jack
and
he
found
a
basket
and
an
umbrella
and
set
out
he
took
advantage
of
a
little
lull
in
the
rain
and
ran
to
the
gate
hullo
he
exclaimed
now
i
have
to
wade
why
it
nearly
a
foot
deep
there
be
the
biggest
kind
of
a
freshet
in
the
cocahutchie
is
this
jolly
the
rain
pattered
on
the
roof
as
if
it
had
been
the
head
of
a
drum
if
the
house
was
gloomy
the
old
barn
was
darker
and
gloomier
jack
turned
over
a
measure
and
sat
down
on
it
i
want
to
think
he
said
i
want
to
get
out
of
this
seems
to
me
i
never
felt
it
so
before
i
as
lief
live
in
this
barn
as
stay
in
crofield
he
suddenly
sprang
up
and
shook
off
his
blues
exclaiming
i
go
and
see
the
freshet
anyhow
he
carried
the
eggs
into
the
house
all
the
time
he
had
been
gone
elder
holloway
had
been
asking
mary
very
particularly
about
the
crofield
academy
i
do
wonder
she
says
what
she
does
about
the
trustees
remarked
aunt
melinda
she
took
the
primary
room
twice
for
a
month
each
time
when
the
teacher
was
sick
and
all
the
thanks
she
had
was
that
they
did
like
it
when
they
found
it
out
the
gutter
in
front
of
the
house
had
now
become
a
small
torrent
all
the
other
gutters
are
just
like
that
said
jack
so
are
the
brooks
all
over
the
country
and
it
all
runs
into
the
cocahutchie
father
said
jack
after
supper
i
going
down
to
the
creek
i
wish
you
would
said
his
father
come
back
and
tell
us
how
looking
could
a
freshet
here
do
any
damage
asked
murdoch
there
a
big
dam
up
at
four
corners
said
the
blacksmith
if
anything
should
happen
there
we
have
trouble
here
and
you
have
it
in
mertonville
too
jack
heard
that
as
he
was
going
out
of
the
door
he
carried
an
umbrella
but
the
first
thing
he
noticed
was
that
the
force
of
the
rain
seemed
to
have
slackened
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
doors
it
was
now
more
like
mist
or
a
warm
sleet
as
if
crofield
were
drifting
through
a
cloud
the
washington
house
needs
all
the
rain
it
can
get
said
jack
as
he
went
along
but
half
the
roof
is
caved
in
i
glad
insured
when
jack
reached
the
creek
he
felt
his
heart
fairly
jump
with
excitement
the
cocahutchie
was
no
longer
a
thin
ribbon
rippling
along
in
a
wide
stretch
of
sand
and
gravel
it
was
a
turbid
swollen
roaring
flood
already
filling
all
the
space
under
its
bridge
and
the
clump
of
old
trees
was
in
the
water
instead
of
on
dry
land
hurrah
shouted
jack
as
high
as
that
already
and
the
worst
is
to
come
he
could
not
see
the
dam
at
first
but
the
gusts
of
wind
were
making
openings
in
the
mist
and
he
soon
caught
glimpses
of
a
great
sheet
of
foaming
brown
water
i
go
and
take
a
look
at
the
dam
he
said
and
he
ran
to
the
mill
it
just
level
with
the
dam
he
said
after
one
swift
glance
i
never
thought
of
that
i
must
go
and
tell
old
hammond
what
coming
the
miller
house
was
not
far
away
and
he
and
his
family
were
at
supper
when
there
came
a
bang
at
the
door
then
it
opened
and
hammond
exclaimed
why
john
ogden
i
out
o
breath
said
jack
excitedly
you
tell
him
that
the
water
up
to
the
lower
floor
of
the
mill
if
he
got
anything
there
that
be
hurt
by
getting
wet
goodness
yes
shouted
the
miller
getting
up
from
the
table
enough
to
ruin
me
there
are
sacks
of
flour
meal
grain
all
sorts
of
stuff
it
must
all
go
up
to
the
second
floor
i
call
all
the
hands
but
said
his
wife
it
sunday
ca
help
it
he
exclaimed
the
cocahutchie
coming
right
up
into
the
mill
jack
tell
every
man
you
see
that
i
want
him
off
went
jack
homeward
but
he
spoke
to
half
a
dozen
men
on
the
way
he
did
not
run
but
he
went
quickly
enough
and
when
he
reached
the
house
there
was
something
waiting
for
him
it
was
a
horse
with
a
blanket
strapped
on
instead
of
a
saddle
and
by
it
stood
his
father
and
near
him
stood
his
mother
and
aunt
melinda
and
mary
bareheaded
for
it
was
not
raining
now
mount
jack
said
the
blacksmith
quietly
i
seen
the
creek

only
four
and
a
half
miles
to
the
four
corners
ride
fast
see
how
that
dam
looks
and
come
back
and
tell
me
murdoch

have
his
buggy
ready
to
start
when
you
get
back

how
many
logs
there
are
in
the
boom
oh
jack
exclaimed
mary
in
a
low
suppressed
voice
i
wish
that
i
were
you
it
a
great
day
for
you
he
had
sprung
to
the
saddle
while
his
father
was
speaking
and
he
felt
it
was
out
of
his
power
to
utter
a
word
in
reply
he
did
not
need
to
speak
to
the
horse
for
the
moment
ogden
released
the
bit
there
was
a
quick
bound
forward
this
horse
is
ready
to
go
said
jack
to
himself
as
he
felt
that
motion
i
seen
her
before
i
wonder
what
made
her
so
excited
there
was
no
need
for
wonder
the
trim
sorrel
mare
he
was
riding
had
been
kept
in
the
hotel
stables
until
that
day
she
had
been
taken
out
to
a
neighboring
stable
at
the
morning
alarm
of
fire
and
when
the
blacksmith
went
to
borrow
her
he
found
her
laboring
under
a
strong
impression
that
things
in
crofield
were
going
wrong
she
was
therefore
inclined
to
go
fast
and
all
that
jack
had
to
do
was
to
hold
her
in
the
blacksmith
son
was
at
home
in
the
saddle
it
was
not
yet
dark
and
he
knew
the
road
to
the
four
corners
it
was
a
muddy
road
and
there
was
a
little
stream
of
water
along
each
side
of
it
spattered
and
splashed
from
head
to
foot
were
rider
and
horse
but
the
miles
vanished
rapidly
and
the
four
corners
was
reached
a
smaller
village
than
crofield
further
up
among
the
hills
it
had
a
higher
dam
a
three
times
larger
pond
a
bigger
and
a
large
that
was
because
there
were
forests
of
timbers
among
the
yet
higher
hills
beyond
and
ogden
had
been
thinking
seriously
about
the
logs
from
those
forests
i
know
what
father
means
said
jack
aloud
as
he
galloped
into
the
village
there
were
hardly
any
people
stirring
about
its
one
long
street
but
there
was
a
reason
for
that
and
jack
found
out
what
it
was
when
he
pulled
up
near
the
mill
everybody
has
come
to
watch
the
dam
he
exclaimed
no
use
asking
about
the
logs
though
there
they
are
the
crowd
was
evidently
excited
and
the
air
was
filled
with
shouts
and
answers
the
boom
got
unhitched
and
swung
round
the
dam
said
one
eager
speaker
and
there
all
the
logs
now
hundreds
on
just
up
and
up
on
the
dam
and
when
that
breaks
the
dam
go
mill
and
all
bridge
and
all
and
the
valley
below
be
flooded
the
moon
was
up
and
the
clouds
which
had
hidden
it
were
breaking
away
as
jack
looked
at
the
threatening
spectacle
before
him
the
sorrel
mare
was
tugging
hard
at
the
rein
and
pawing
the
mud
under
her
feet
while
jack
listened
to
the
talk
stand
it
no
he
heard
a
man
say
that
dam
was
built
to
stand
any
such
crowdin
as
that
hark
a
groaning
straining
cracking
sound
came
from
the
barrier
behind
which
the
foaming
flood
was
widening
and
deepening
the
pond
there
it
goes
it
breaking
jack
wheeled
the
sorrel
as
a
dull
thunderous
report
was
answered
by
a
great
cry
from
the
crowd
and
then
he
dashed
away
down
the
homeward
road
i
must
get
to
crofield
before
the
water
does
he
said
glad
the
creek
so
crooked
it
has
twice
as
far
to
travel
as
i
have
not
quite
considering
how
a
flood
will
sweep
over
a
bend
instead
of
following
it
still
jack
and
the
sorrel
had
the
start
and
nearly
all
the
way
it
was
a
downhill
road
the
crofield
people
gathered
fast
after
the
sky
cleared
for
a
rumor
went
around
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
the
dam
and
that
a
man
had
gone
to
the
four
comers
to
warn
the
people
there
all
the
men
that
could
crowd
into
the
mill
had
helped
hammond
get
his
grain
up
into
the
second
story
but
the
water
was
a
deep
on
the
lower
floor
by
the
time
it
was
done
there
came
a
moment
when
all
was
silent
except
the
roar
of
the
water
and
through
that
silence
the
thud
of
hoofs
was
heard
coming
down
from
main
street
then
a
shrill
excited
voice
shouted
all
of
you
get
off
that
bridge
the
four
corners
dam
gone
the
boom
broken
and
the
logs
are
coming
there
was
a
tumult
of
questioning
as
men
gathered
around
the
sorrel
and
there
was
a
swift
clearing
of
people
from
the
bridge
why
it
shaking
now
said
the
blacksmith
to
murdoch
it
go
down
with
the
first
log
that
strikes
it
you
drive
your
best
home
to
mertonville
and
warn
them
you
may
be
just
in
time
away
went
the
editor
carrying
with
him
an
extraordinary
treasure
of
news
for
the
next
number
of
his
journal
jack
dismounted
and
her
owner
took
the
sorrel
to
her
stable
she
was
very
muddy
but
none
the
worse
for
the
service
she
had
rendered
the
crowd
stood
waiting
for
what
was
sure
to
come
miller
hammond
was
anxiously
watching
his
threatened
and
already
damaged
property
jack
came
and
stood
beside
him
hammond
he
said
all
the
gravel
that
you
were
going
to
sell
to
father
is
lying
under
water
more
than
two
acres
of
it
said
the
miller
the
water
run
off
though
i
tell
you
what
i
do
jack
i
sell
it
for
two
hundred
dollars
considering
the
flood
if
father
take
it
will
you
count
in
the
fifty
you
said
you
owed
me
inquired
jack
the
miller
made
a
wry
face
for
a
moment
but
then
responded
smiling
well
after
what
you
done
too
saved
all
there
was
on
the
first
floor
yes
i
will
tell
him
i
do
it
they
all
turned
suddenly
toward
the
dam
a
high
ridge
of
water
was
sweeping
down
across
the
pond
it
carried
a
crest
of
foam
logs
planks
and
rubbish
shining
white
in
the
moonlight
and
it
rolled
on
toward
the
mill
and
the
dam
as
if
it
had
an
errand
crash
roar
crash
and
a
plunging
sound
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
crofield
dam
had
vanished
but
it
had
not
only
a
section
of
its
top
work
in
the
middle
had
been
knocked
away
by
the
rushing
stroke
of
those
logs
a
frightened
shout
went
up
from
the
spectators
and
it
had
hardly
died
away
before
there
followed
another
splintering
crash
the
bridge
shouted
jack
the
frail
supports
of
the
bridge
brittle
with
age
and
weather
already
straining
hard
against
the
furious
water
needed
only
the
battering
of
the
first
heavy
logs
from
the
boom
and
down
they
went
gone
exclaimed
ogden
the
hotel
gone
and
the
and
the
dam
and
the
bridge
there
wo
be
anything
left
of
crofield
at
this
rate
i
going
to
get
out
of
it
said
jack
i
never
refuse
you
again
replied
his
father
with
energy
you
may
get
out
any
way
you
can
and
take
your
chances
anywhere
you
please
i
wo
stand
in
your
way
the
roar
of
the
surging
cocahutchie
was
the
only
sound
heard
for
a
full
minute
and
then
the
miller
spoke
the
mill
safe
he
said
with
a
very
long
breath
of
relief
the
breaking
of
that
hole
in
the
dam
let
the
water
and
logs
through
and
the
pond
is
rising
hurrah
there
was
a
very
faint
and
scattering
cheer
and
jack
ogden
did
not
join
in
it
he
had
turned
suddenly
and
walked
away
homeward
along
the
narrow
strip
of
land
that
remained
between
the
wide
swollen
cocahutchie
and
the
fence
at
the
end
of
the
fence
where
he
came
into
his
own
street
away
above
where
the
head
of
the
bridge
had
been
there
was
a
large
gathering
that
around
the
mill
had
been
nearly
all
of
men
and
boys
here
were
women
and
girls
and
the
smaller
boys
whose
mothers
and
aunts
held
them
and
kept
them
from
going
nearer
the
water
jack
found
it
of
no
use
to
say
oh
mother
i
too
muddy
she
did
care
how
muddy
he
was
and
aunt
melinda
cared
even
less
apparently
bessie
and
sue
had
evidently
been
crying
but
mary
had
not
and
it
was
her
hand
on
arm
that
led
him
away
up
the
street
toward
their
gate
oh
jack
she
exclaimed
i
so
proud
did
you
ride
fast
i
glad
i
can
ride
i
could
have
done
it
too
it
was
splendid
molly
said
jack
i
do
mind
telling
you
the
sorrel
mare
galloped
all
the
way
going
and
coming
up
hill
and
down
and
molly
i
kept
wishing
and
thinking
every
jump
she
gave
wishing
i
was
galloping
to
new
york
instead
of
to
the
four
corners
molly
he
added
quickly
father
gives
it
up
and
says
i
may
go
chapter
vi
out
into
the
world
monday
morning
came
bright
and
sunshiny
and
it
hardly
reached
crofield
before
the
people
began
to
get
up
and
look
about
them
jack
went
down
to
the
river
and
did
not
get
back
very
soon
his
mind
was
full
of
something
besides
the
flood
and
he
did
not
linger
long
at
the
mill
but
he
looked
long
and
hard
at
all
the
pieces
of
land
below
the
mill
down
to
deacon
hawkins
line
he
knew
where
that
was
although
the
fence
was
gone
the
freshet
did
wash
away
a
foot
of
it
he
said
i
tell
father
what
hammond
said
about
selling
it
a
pair
of
men
drove
down
from
main
street
in
a
buggy
and
halted
near
him
brady
said
one
of
these
men
the
engineer
is
right
we
change
the
railroad
line
we
can
say
to
the
crofield
people
that
if
they
give
us
the
right
of
way
through
the
village
we
build
them
a
new
bridge
they
do
it
right
here
the
spot
for
the
station
exactly
said
the
other
man
and
the
less
we
say
about
it
the
better
keep
mum
that
just
what
i
do
too
said
jack
to
himself
as
they
drove
away
i
do
know
what
they
mean
but
it
come
out
some
day
jack
went
home
at
once
and
found
the
family
at
breakfast
after
breakfast
his
father
went
to
the
shop
and
jack
followed
him
to
speak
about
the
land
purchase
when
jack
explained
the
miller
offer
ogden
went
with
him
to
see
hammond
after
a
short
interview
ogden
and
jack
secured
the
land
in
settlement
of
the
amount
already
promised
jack
and
of
an
old
debt
owed
by
the
miller
to
the
blacksmith
and
also
in
consideration
of
their
consenting
to
a
previous
sale
of
the
trees
for
cash
to
the
bannermans
who
had
made
their
offer
that
morning
hammond
seemed
very
glad
to
make
the
sale
upon
these
terms
as
he
was
in
need
of
ready
money
when
jack
returned
to
his
father
shop
he
remembered
the
men
he
had
seen
at
the
river
and
he
told
his
father
what
they
had
said
station
right
of
way
exclaimed
ogden
that
the
new
railroad
through
mertonville
they
use
up
that
land
and
we
get
a
cent
well
it
did
cost
anything
i
about
given
up
collecting
that
bill
later
that
day
jack
came
in
to
dinner
with
a
smile
on
his
face
it
was
the
old
smile
too
a
smile
of
which
flickered
over
his
lips
from
side
to
side
and
twisted
them
and
shut
his
mouth
tight
just
as
he
was
about
to
speak
his
father
took
a
long
neatly
folded
paper
out
of
his
coat
pocket
and
laid
it
on
the
table
look
at
that
jack
he
said
and
show
it
to
your
mother
warranty
deed
exclaimed
jack
reading
the
print
on
the
outside
father
you
did
turn
it
over
to
me
did
you
mother
it
to
john
ogden
oh
john
she
began
and
stopped
why
my
dear
laughed
the
blacksmith
cheerfully
it
his
gravel
not
mine
i
hold
it
for
him
for
a
while
but
it
is
jack
whenever
i
chose
to
record
that
deed
i
afraid
i
could
farm
it
there
said
jack
and
then
the
smile
on
his
face
flickered
fast
but
i
knew
father
wanted
that
land
it
is
worth
much
but
it
a
beginning
said
mary
i
like
to
own
something
or
other
or
to
go
somewhere
well
molly
answered
jack
smiling

go
to

open
carriage
it

molly
mother

said
his
father
but
that
nothing
much
it
less
than
nine
miles
father
said
jack
you
said
last
night
i
need
come
back
to
crofield
right
away
and
mertonville
nine
miles
nearer
the
city
and
a
good
many
times
nine
miles
yet
to
go
exclaimed
the
blacksmith
but
then
he
added
smiling
go
ahead
jack
i
do
believe
that
if
any
boy
can
get
there
you
can
i
do
it
somehow
said
jack
with
a
determined
nod
of
course
you
will
said
mary
jack
felt
as
if
circumstances
were
changing
pretty
fast
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
and
so
did
mary
for
she
had
about
given
up
all
hope
of
seeing
her
friends
in
mertonville
we
get
you
ready
right
away
said
aunt
melinda
you

give
jack
your
traveling
bag

wo
mind
the
key
being
lost
and
let
you
take
my
trunk
and
we
fit
you
out
so
you
can
enjoy
it
jack
said
his
father
tell
livermore
you
can
go
and
then
i
want
to
see
you
at
the
shop
jack
was
so
glad
he
could
hardly
speak
for
he
felt
it
was
the
first
step
but
a
part
of
his
feeling
was
that
he
had
never
before
loved
crofield
and
all
the
people
in
it
especially
his
own
family
so
much
as
at
that
minute
he
went
over
to
the
ruined
hotel
where
he
found
the
landlord
at
work
saving
all
sorts
of
things
and
seeming
to
feel
reasonably
cheerful
over
his
misfortunes
jack
he
said
as
soon
as
he
was
told
that
jack
was
ready
to
go
you
and
molly
will
have
company
miss
glidden
sent
to
know
how
she
could
best
get
over
to
mertonville
and
i
said
she
could
go
with
you
there
a
visitor
too
who
must
go
back
with
her
i
take
said
jack
upon
going
to
the
shop
he
found
his
father
shoeing
a
horse
the
blacksmith
beckoned
his
son
to
the
further
end
of
the
shop
he
heard
about
miss
glidden
and
listened
in
silence
to
several
hopeful
things
jack
had
to
say
about
what
he
meant
to
do
sooner
or
later
illustration
listened
in
well
he
said
at
last
i
was
right
not
to
let
you
go
before
and
i
doubts
about
it
now
but
something
must
be
done
i
making
less
and
less
and
not
much
of
it
cash
and
it
costs
more
to
live
and
they
all
growing
up
i
do
want
you
to
make
me
any
promises
they
are
broken
too
easily
you
need
form
good
resolutions
they
wo
hold
water
there
one
thing
i
want
you
to
do
though
your
mother
and
i
have
brought
you
up
as
straight
as
a
string
and
you
know
what
right
and
what
wrong
that
true
said
jack
well
then
do
you
promise
nor
form
any
resolutions
but
if
tempted
to
do
wrong
or
to
be
a
fool
in
any
kind
of
way
just
do
do
it
that
all
i
wo
father
said
jack
earnestly
there
said
his
father
i
feel
better
satisfied
than
i
should
feel
if
you
promised
a
hundred
things
it
a
great
deal
better
not
to
do
anything
that
you
know
to
be
wrong
or
foolish
i
think
so
said
jack
and
i
wo
go
home
now
and
get
ready
said
his
father
and
i
see
you
off
this
is
very
sudden
jack
said
his
mother
with
much
feeling
when
he
made
his
appearance
why
mother
said
jack
molly
be
back
soon
and
the
city
is
so
far
away
after
all
jack
felt
as
if
he
had
only
about
enough
head
left
to
change
his
clothes
and
drive
the
team
it
just
as
mother
says
he
thought
i
been
wishing
and
hoping
for
it
but
it
come
very
suddenly
his
black
was
quickly
ready
he
had
closed
it
and
was
walking
to
the
door
when
his
mother
came
in
jack
she
said
you
send
me
a
postal
card
every
day
or
two
of
course
i
will
said
he
bravely
and
i
know
you
be
back
in
a
few
weeks
at
most
she
went
on
but
i
feel
as
sad
as
if
you
were
really
going
away
from
home
why
almost
a
child
you
ca
really
be
going
away
that
was
where
the
talk
stopped
for
a
while
except
some
last
words
that
jack
could
never
forget
then
she
dried
her
eyes
and
he
dried
his
and
they
went
together
it
was
hard
to
say
to
all
the
family
and
he
was
glad
his
father
was
not
there
he
got
away
from
them
as
soon
as
he
could
and
went
over
to
the
stables
after
his
team
it
was
a
bay
team
with
a
fine
harness
and
the
open
carriage
was
almost
new
stylish
said
jack
i
take
molly
on
the
front
seat
with
me
no
the
trunk
and
miss
glidden
trunk
well
i
get
all
in
somehow
when
he
drove
up
in
front
of
the
house
his
father
was
there
to
put
the
baggage
in
and
to
help
mary
into
the
carriage
and
to
shake
hands
with
jack
the
blacksmith
grimy
face
looked
less
gloomy
for
a
moment
jack
he
said
may
be
you
really
get
to
the
city
after
all
i
think
i
shall
said
jack
with
an
effort
to
speak
calmly
well
said
the
blacksmith
slowly
i
hope
you
will
somehow
but
do
you
forget
that
there
another
city
jack
knew
what
he
meant
they
shook
hands
and
in
another
moment
the
bays
were
trotting
briskly
on
their
way
to
miss
glidden
her
house
was
one
of
the
finest
in
crofield
with
lawn
and
shrubbery
mary
ogden
had
never
been
inside
of
it
but
she
had
heard
that
it
was
beautifully
furnished
there
was
miss
glidden
and
her
friend
on
the
piazza
and
out
at
the
sidewalk
by
the
gate
was
a
pile
of
baggage
at
the
sight
of
which
jack
exclaimed
trunks
they
young
houses
how
i
get
all
in
i
can
strap
and
rope
one
on
the
back
of
the
carriage
but
then
miss
glidden
frowned
at
first
when
the
carriage
pulled
up
but
she
came
out
to
the
gate
smiling
and
so
did
the
other
lady
why
mary
ogden
my
dear
she
said
potter
and
i
did
not
know
you
were
going
with
us
it
quite
a
surprise
so
it
is
to
jack
and
me
replied
mary
quietly
we
were
very
glad
to
have
you
come
though
if
we
can
find
room
for
your
trunks
i
can
manage
said
jack
miss
glidden
you
and
potter
get
in
and
pat
and
i
pack
the
trunks
on
somehow
pat
was
the
man
who
had
brought
out
the
luggage
and
he
was
waiting
to
help
he
was
needed
it
was
a
very
full
carriage
when
he
and
jack
finished
their
work
there
was
room
made
for
the
passengers
by
putting
mary
small
trunk
down
in
front
so
that
jack
feet
sprawled
over
it
from
the
nook
where
he
sat
i
can
manage
the
team
jack
said
to
himself
they
wo
run
away
with
this
load
mary
sat
behind
him
the
other
two
on
the
back
seat
and
all
the
rest
of
the
carriage
was
trunks
not
to
speak
of
what
jack
called
a
young
house
moored
behind
it
all
helped
jack
to
recover
his
usual
composure
nevertheless
and
he
drove
out
of
crofield
on
the
mertonville
road
confidently
we
shall
discern
traces
of
the
devastation
occasioned
by
the
recent
inundation
as
we
progress
remarked
potter
jack
replied
oh
no
the
creek
takes
a
great
swoop
below
crofield
and
the
road
a
short
cut
there
be
some
mud
though
he
was
right
and
wrong
there
was
mud
that
forced
the
heavily
laden
carriage
to
travel
slowly
here
and
there
but
there
was
nothing
seen
of
the
cocahutchie
for
several
miles
hullo
exclaimed
jack
suddenly
it
looks
like
a
kind
of
lake
it
does
come
up
over
the
road
though
i
wonder
what
dam
has
given
out
now
there
was
the
road
safe
enough
but
all
the
country
to
the
right
of
it
seemed
to
have
been
turned
into
water
on
rolled
the
carriage
the
horses
now
and
then
allowing
signs
of
fear
and
distrust
and
the
two
older
passengers
expressing
ten
times
as
much
now
molly
said
jack
at
last
there
a
bridge
across
the
creek
a
little
ahead
of
this
i
forgotten
about
that
hope
it
there
yet
oh
dear
me
exclaimed
miss
glidden
do
prognosticate
disaster
said
potter
earnestly
and
it
occurred
to
jack
that
he
had
heard
more
long
words
during
that
drive
than
any
one
boy
could
hope
to
remember
hurrah
he
shouted
a
few
minutes
later
link
bridge
is
there
there
water
on
both
sides
of
the
road
though
it
was
an
old
bridge
like
that
at
crofield
and
it
was
narrow
and
it
trembled
and
shook
while
the
snorting
bays
pranced
and
shied
their
frightened
way
across
it
they
went
down
the
slope
on
the
other
side
with
a
dash
that
would
have
been
a
bolt
if
jack
had
not
been
ready
for
them
jack
was
holding
them
with
a
hard
pull
upon
the
reins
but
he
was
also
looking
up
the
cocahutchie
i
see
what
the
matter
he
said
the
logs
got
stuck
in
a
narrow
place
and
made
a
dam
of
their
own
and
set
the
water
back
over
the
flat
the
freshet
has
reached
mertonville
yet
jingo
bang
crack
crash
came
a
sharp
sound
behind
him
the
bridge
is
down
he
shouted
we
were
only
just
in
time
some
of
the
logs
have
been
carried
down
and
one
of
them
knocked
it
endwise
that
was
precisely
the
truth
of
the
matter
and
away
went
the
bays
as
if
they
meant
to
race
with
the
freshet
to
see
which
would
first
arrive
in
mertonville
i
on
my
way
to
the
city
any
how
thought
jack
with
deep
satisfaction
chapter
vii
mary
and
the
the
bay
team
traveled
well
but
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
jack
drove
into
the
town
having
been
in
mertonville
before
jack
knew
where
to
take
miss
glidden
and
potter
mertonville
was
a
thriving
place
calling
itself
a
town
and
ambitious
of
some
day
becoming
a
city
not
long
after
entering
the
village
miss
glidden
touched
jack
arm
stop

exclaimed
miss
glidden
there
are
our
friends
the
very
people
we
going
to
see
edwards
and
the
judge
and
all
the
party
on
foot
had
also
halted
and
were
waiting
to
greet
the
visitors
after
welcomes
had
been
exchanged
edwards
a
tall
dignified
lady
with
gray
hair
turned
to
mary
and
offered
her
hand
i
delighted
to
see
you
miss
ogden
she
exclaimed
and
your

holloway
and
the
murdochs
they

murdochs
said
mary
a
little
embarrassed
by
the
warmth
of
the
greeting
you
will
come
to
see
me
before
you
go
home
said
edwards
i
do
wonder

fond
of

and
so
proud
of

make
her
come
miss
glidden
i
should
be
very

said
miss
glidden
benevolently
but
mary

the
judge
himself
very
heartily
if
she
does
i
come
after
her
shall
i
drive
to
your
house
now
judge
edwards
jack
said
at
last
the
party
separated
and
jack
started
the
bay
team
again
the
house
of
judge
edwards
was
only
a
short
distance
farther
and
that
of
potter
was
just
beyond
mary
ogden
said
miss
glidden
in
parting
you
must
surely
accept
edwards
invitation
she
is
the
kindest
of
women
yes
miss
glidden
said
mary
demurely
jack
broke
in
of
course
you
will
you
have
a
real
good
time
too
and
you
come
and
see
me
said
potter
and
mary
promised
then
jack
and
the
judge
coachman
lowered
to
the
sidewalk
miss
glidden
enormous
trunk
as
potter
alighted
a
few
minutes
later
she
declared
to
mary
i
confident
my
dear
that
you
will
experience
enthusiastic
hospitality
what
shall
i
do
asked
mary
as
they
drove
away
miss
glidden
did
mean
what
she
said
she
is
not
fond
of
me
the
judge
meant
it
said
jack
they
liked
you
none
of
them
pressed
me
to
come
visiting
i
noticed
i
leave
you
at
and
take
the
team
to
the
stable
and
then
go
to
the
office
of
the
and
see
the
editor
but
when
they
reached
the
murdochs
good
murdoch
came
to
the
door
she
kissed
mary
and
then
said
i
so
glad
to
see
you
so
glad
you
come
poor
murdoch
jack
going
to
the
office
to
see
him
said
mary
he
need
go
there
said
the
editor
wife
murdoch
is
ill
at
home
the
storm
and
the
excitement
and
the
exposure
have
broken
him
down
come
right
in
dear
come
back
jack
as
soon
as
you
have
taken
care
of
the
horses
it
a
pity
said
jack
as
he
drove
away
the
will
have
a
hard
time
of
it
without
any
editor
he
was
still
considering
that
matter
when
he
reached
the
but
he
was
abruptly
aroused
from
his
thoughts
by
the
owner
of
the
team
who
cried
excitedly
hurrah
here
my
team
i
say
young
man
how
did
you
cross
bridge
a
man
on
horseback
just
came
here
and
told
us
it
was
down
i
was
afraid
i
lost
my
team
for
a
week
well
here
they
are
said
jack
smiling
they
both
good
swimmers
and
as
for
the
carriage
it
floated
like
a
boat
oh
it
did
laughed
the
as
he
examined
his
property
livermore
sent
you
with
them
i
suppose
i
was
losing
five
dollars
a
day
by
not
having
those
horses
here
what
your
name
do
you
live
in
crofield
jack
ogden
oh
you
the
blacksmith
son
old
murdoch
told
me
about
you
my
name
prodger
i
know
your
father
and
i
known
him
twenty
years
how
did
you
get
over
the
creek
tell
me
about
it
jack
told
him
and
prodger
drew
a
long
breath
at
the
end
of
the
story
you
did
know
the
risk
you
were
running
he
said
but
you
did
and
if
i
needed
another
driver
i
be
glad
to
hire
you
what
did
livermore
say
i
was
to
pay
you
he
did
say
said
jack
i
was
thinking
about
being
paid
so
much
the
better
i
think
the
more
of
you
my
boy
but
it
was
plucky
to
drive
that
team
over
link
bridge
just
before
it
went
down
i
tell
you
what
i
do
i
pay
you
what
they
earn
me
it
will
be
about
three
dollars
and
we
call
it
square
how
will
that
do
it
more
than
i
earned
said
jack
gratefully
i
satisfied
if
you
are
said
prodger
as
jack
jumped
down
come
and
see
me
again
if
you
to
be
in
town
you
fond
of
horses
and
have
a
knack
with
them
three
dollars
said
jack
after
the
money
had
been
paid
him
and
he
was
on
his
way
back
to
the
murdochs
mother
let
me
have
the
six
dollars
they
gave
me
for
the
fish
and
this
makes
nine
dollars
why
it
will
take
me
the
rest
of
the
way
to
the
city
but
i
would
have
a
cent
when
i
got
there
when
he
reached
the
editor
house
jack
noticed
that
the
house
was
on
the
same
square
with
the
block
of
wooden
buildings
containing
the
office
and
that
the
editor
could
go
to
his
work
through
his
own
garden
if
he
chose
instead
of
around
by
the
street
he
was
again
welcomed
by
murdoch
and
then
led
at
once
into
murdoch
room
where
the
editor
was
in
bed
groaning
and
complaining
in
a
way
that
indicated
much
distress
i
very
sorry
you
sick
murdoch
said
jack
thank
you
jack
it
just
my
luck
it
the
very
worst
time
for
me
to
be
on
the
nobody
to
get
out
the
lost
my
too
lost
your
exclaimed
jack
yes
said
murdoch
in
despair
no
no
editor
nobody
but
a
wooden
foreman
and
a
pair
of
the
man
that
does
the
mailing
has
more
than
he
can
do
too
there
wo
be
any
this
week
and
perhaps
none
next
week
plenty
of
nearly
ready
too
it
too
bad
illustration
there
wo
be
any
eagle
this
week
you
need
feel
so
discouraged
said
jack
deeply
touched
by
the
distress
of
the
groaning
editor
molly
and
i
know
what
to
do
she
can
manage
the
copy
just
as
she
did
for
the
once
so
can
i
we
go
right
to
work
oh
yes
i
forgotten
said
murdoch
you
worked
a
while
at
printing
i
willing
you
should
see
what
you
can
do
i
like
to
speak
to
mary
i
sorry
to
say
that
you
have
to
sleep
in
the
office
jack
for
we
only
one
spare
room
in
this
nutshell
of
a
house
i
do
mind
that
said
jack
i
hope
i
be
out
in
a
day
or
so
added
the
editor
but
jack
the
press
is
run
by
a
pony
and
that
foreman
could
run
it
to
save
his
life
he
added
hopelessly
why
it
nothing
to
do
exclaimed
jack
i
helped
run
an
engine
for
a
steam
do
you
be
worried
about
the
engine
murdoch
was
able
to
be
up
a
little
while
in
the
evening
and
mary
came
in
to
see
him
from
what
he
said
to
her
it
seemed
as
if
there
was
really
very
little
to
do
in
editing
the
remainder
of
the
next
number
of
the
i
so
glad
you
here
said
murdoch
when
mary
came
out
to
supper
i
never
read
a
newspaper
myself
and
i
do
know
the
first
thing
about
putting
one
together
it
too
bad
that
you
should
be
bothered
with
it
though
why
murdoch
exclaimed
mary
laughing
i
shall
be
delighted
i
rather
do
it
than
not
the
truth
was
that
it
was
not
easy
for
either
mary
or
her
brother
to
be
very
sorry
that
murdoch
was
not
able
to
work
they
did
not
feel
anxious
about
him
for
his
wife
had
told
them
it
was
not
a
serious
attack
and
they
enjoyed
the
prospect
of
editing
the
newspaper
after
supper
jack
and
mary
went
through
the
garden
to
the
office
the
was
in
a
sort
of
woodshed
the
press
was
in
the
kitchen
as
mary
called
it
and
the
front
room
of
the
little
old
was
the
business
office
the
editor
office
and
the
room
were
jack
took
a
look
at
the
engine
any
one
could
run
that
he
said
i
know
just
how
to
set
it
going
come
on
molly
this
is
going
to
be
great
fun
the
editor
room
was
only
large
enough
for
a
table
and
a
chair
and
a
few
heaps
of
exchange
newspapers
the
table
was
littered
and
piled
with
scraps
of
writing
and
printing
see
exclaimed
jack
picking
up
a
sheet
of
paper
the
last
thing
murdoch
did
was
to
finish
an
account
of
his
visit
to
crofield
and
the
flood
we
put
that
in
first
thing
it
easy
to
edit
a
newspaper
where
are
the
scissors
we
need
bother
to
write
new
editorials
said
mary
here
are
all
these
papers
full
of
them
of
course
said
jack
but
we
must
pick
out
good
ones
their
tastes
differed
somewhat
and
mary
condemned
a
number
of
articles
that
seemed
to
jack
excellent
however
she
selected
a
story
and
some
poems
and
a
bright
letter
from
europe
and
jack
found
an
account
of
an
exciting
a
horrible
railway
accident
a
match
a
fight
with
indians
an
explosion
of
dynamite
and
several
long
strips
of
jokes
and
conundrums
these
are
splendid
editorials
said
mary
looking
up
from
her
reading
we
can
cut
them
down
to
fit
the
and
nobody
will
suspect
that
murdoch
has
been
away
oh
they
do
said
jack
they
all
lively
murdoch
is
sure
to
be
satisfied
i
do
think
he
can
write
better
editorials
himself
the
young
editors
were
much
excited
over
their
work
and
soon
became
so
absorbed
in
their
duties
that
it
was
ten
before
they
knew
it
now
molly
said
jack
we
go
to
the
house
and
tell
him
it
all
right
we
set
the
in
the
morning
i
knew
we
could
edit
it
mary
had
very
little
to
say
her
fingers
ached
from
plying
the
scissors
her
eyes
burned
from
reading
so
much
and
so
fast
and
her
head
was
in
a
whirl
at
the
house
they
met
murdoch
oh
my
dear
children
exclaimed
she
to
mary
murdoch
is
delirious
the
doctor
been
here
and
says
he
wo
be
able
to
think
of
work
not
for
days
and
days
can
you
you
run
the
you
wo
let
it
stop
no
indeed
said
mary
there
plenty
of
ready
and
jack
can
run
the
engine
i
so
glad
said
murdoch
i
never
dare
to
clip
anything
i
might
make
serious
mistakes
he
so
careful
not
to
attack
anything
nor
to
offend
anybody
all
sorts
of
people
take
the
and
murdoch
says
he
has
to
steer
clear
of
almost
everything
we
wo
write
anything
said
jack
we
just
select
the
best
there
is
and
put
it
right
in
those
city
editors
on
the
big
papers
know
what
to
write
the
editor
wife
was
convinced
and
after
mary
had
gone
to
her
room
jack
returned
to
a
room
prepared
for
him
in
the
office
i
wear
my
sunday
clothes
said
jack
i
put
on
a
hickory
shirt
and
old
trousers
then
i
be
ready
to
work
the
last
thing
he
remembered
saying
to
himself
was
well
i
nine
miles
nearer
to
new
york
morning
came
and
jack
was
busy
before
breakfast
but
he
went
to
the
house
early
i
must
be
there
when
the
come
he
said
to
murdoch
molly
ought
to
be
in
the
office
too
i
told
murdoch
she
said
but
he
has
a
severe
headache
he
ca
bear
to
talk
he
need
talk
if
he
does
feel
able
replied
jack
the
will
come
out
all
right
mary
could
hardly
wait
to
finish
her
cup
of
coffee
but
she
tried
hard
to
appear
calm
she
was
ready
as
soon
as
jack
but
she
did
not
have
quite
so
much
confidence
in
her
ability
to
do
whatever
might
be
necessary
there
was
to
be
some
done
that
forenoon
and
the
had
steam
up
when
the
foreman
and
the
two
reached
the
office
black
said
jack
as
he
came
into
the
it
all
right
i
jack
ogden
a
friend
of
murdoch
the
new
editor
upstairs
there
some
copy
ready
murdoch
will
not
be
at
the
office
for
a
week
bless
me
said
black
i
reckoned
that
we
have
to
strike
work
what
we
need
most
is
a
i
can
be
said
jack
i
used
to
run
the
boys
said
the
foreman
without
the
change
of
a
muscle
in
his
face
murdoch
hired
a
proxy
i
go
up
for
copy
he
stumped
upstairs
to
what
he
called
the
sanctum
the
door
stood
open
black
eyes
blinked
rapidly
when
he
saw
mary
at
the
editor
table
but
he
did
not
utter
a
word
black
said
mary
holding
out
manuscript
and
a
number
of
printed
clippings
she
rapidly
told
him
what
they
were
and
how
each
of
them
was
to
be
printed
black
heard
her
to
the
end
and
then
he
said
is
your
name
murdoch
no
sir
miss
ogden
said
mary
but
no
one
need
be
told
that
murdoch
is
not
here
i
do
not
care
to
see
anybody
unless
necessary
yes
said
black
we
go
right
along
glad
the
is
to
come
out
on
time
he
was
very
respectful
as
if
the
idea
of
having
a
young
girl
as
editor
awed
him
and
he
backed
out
of
the
office
with
both
hands
full
of
copy
to
stump
and
tell
his
two
journeymen
it
all
right
boys
bless
me
i
never
saw
the
like
before
he
explained
the
state
of
affairs
and
each
in
turn
soon
managed
to
make
an
errand
and
then
to
come
down
again
almost
as
awed
as
black
had
been
she
a
driver
said
the
foreman
she
was
made
for
a
boss
she
has
it
in
her
eye
even
jack
when
he
was
sent
up
after
copy
was
a
little
astonished
that
the
way
father
looks
he
thought
whenever
he
begins
to
lose
his
temper
the
men
mind
him
then
too
but
he
has
to
be
waked
up
first
i
know
how
she
feels
she
bound
the
shall
come
out
on
time
even
jack
did
not
appreciate
how
responsibility
was
waking
up
mary
ogden
or
how
much
older
she
felt
than
when
she
left
crofield
but
he
had
an
idea
that
she
was
taller
and
that
her
eyes
had
become
darker
bones
the
man
of
all
work
in
the
front
office
below
was
of
the
opinion
that
she
was
very
tall
and
that
her
eyes
were
very
black
and
that
he
did
not
care
to
go
again
for
he
had
blundered
into
the
sanctum
supposing
that
murdoch
was
there
and
remarking
as
he
came
that
there
underdone
gawk
that
helps
edit
the
he
was
jist
in
lookin
for
yes
beg
pardon
i
only
bones
what
did
the
gentleman
want
mr
bones
asked
mary
with
much
dignity
murdoch
is
at
home
he
is
is
it
anything
i
can
attend
to
oh
no
nothing
he
a
blower
we
do
mind
him
i
go
down
right
away
i
see
black
thank
you
he
withdrew
with
many
bows
and
while
he
saw
jack
and
he
not
only
saw
but
felt
that
something
very
new
and
queer
had
happened
to
the
mertonville
both
mary
and
jack
were
aware
that
there
was
a
rival
newspaper
but
it
had
not
occurred
to
them
that
they
were
at
all
interested
in
the
or
in
its
editors
beyond
the
fact
that
both
papers
were
published
on
thursdays
and
that
the
was
the
larger
the
printers
worked
fast
that
day
as
if
something
spurred
them
on
and
black
was
almost
bright
when
he
reported
to
mary
how
much
they
had
done
during
the
day
the
new
boy
the
best
we
ever
had
said
he
please
say
to
murdoch
we
better
keep
him
thank
you
black
said
she
i
hope
murdoch
will
soon
be
well
he
stumped
away
and
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
her
dignity
barely
lasted
until
she
and
jack
found
themselves
in
murdoch
garden
on
their
way
home
it
broke
completely
down
as
they
were
going
between
the
and
the
tomatoes
and
there
they
both
stopped
and
laughed
heartily
but
molly
jack
exclaimed
when
he
recovered
his
breath
we
have
to
print
the
liveliest
kind
of
an
or
the
will
get
ahead
of
us
i
going
out
after
supper
all
over
town
to
pick
up
news
if
i
can
only
find
some
boys
i
know
here
they
could
tell
me
a
lot
of
good
items
the
boys
know
more
of
what
going
on
than
anybody
i
like
to
go
with
you
said
mary
stir
around
and
find
out
all
you
can
i
know
what
to
do
said
jack
with
energy
and
if
he
had
really
undertaken
to
do
all
he
proceeded
to
tell
her
it
would
have
kept
him
out
all
night
chapter
viii
caught
for
a
burglar
supper
was
ready
when
jack
and
mary
went
into
the
house
and
murdoch
was
eager
that
they
should
eat
at
once
she
seemed
very
placidly
to
take
it
for
granted
that
things
were
going
properly
in
the
office
her
husband
had
been
ill
before
and
the
paper
had
somehow
lived
along
and
she
was
not
the
kind
of
woman
to
fret
about
it
he
been
worrying
she
said
to
mary
principally
about
town
news
he
afraid
the
get
ahead
of
you
it
might
be
good
to
see
him
i
see
him
said
mary
mary
mary
came
faintly
in
reply
to
her
kindly
greeting
local
items
mary
society
notes
the
flood
logs
bridges
dams
fires
brief
mention
town
improvement
society
the
sociable
anything
jack
will
be
out
after
news
as
soon
as
he
eats
his
supper
said
mary
he
find
all
there
is
to
find
the
printers
did
a
splendid
work
the
doctor
says
not
to
tell
me
about
anything
said
the
sick
man
despondently
you
fill
the
paper
somehow
do
the
best
you
can
till
i
get
well
she
did
not
linger
for
murdoch
was
already
pulling
her
sleeve
the
three
were
soon
seated
at
the
table
and
hardly
was
a
cup
of
tea
poured
before
murdoch
remarked
mary
she
said
miss
glidden
called
here
with
judge
edwards
in
her
carriage
they
were
sorry
to
find
you
out
so
did
mason
and
so
did
lansing
and
potter
they
wanted
you
to
go
riding
and
there
a
party
coming
i
told
them
all
that
murdoch
was
sick
and
you
were
editing
the
and
jack
was
too
miss
glidden
very
fond
of
you
you
know
so
is
potter
her
husband
wishes
he
knew
what
to
send
jack
for
saving
his
wife
from
being
drowned
this
was
delivered
steadily
but
not
rapidly
and
mary
needed
only
to
say
she
would
have
been
glad
to
see
them
all
i
did
save
anybody
said
jack
if
the
logs
had
hit
the
bridge
while
we
were
on
it
nothing
could
have
saved
us
mary
was
particularly
glad
that
none
of
her
new
friends
were
coming
in
to
spend
the
evening
for
she
felt
she
had
done
enough
for
one
day
murdoch
however
told
her
of
a
union
church
sociable
to
be
held
at
the
house
of
edwards
the
next
thursday
evening
and
said
she
had
promised
to
bring
miss
ogden
of
course
mary
said
she
would
go
but
jack
declined
after
supper
jack
was
eager
to
set
out
upon
his
hunt
after
i
must
let
a
soul
know
what
i
doing
he
said
to
mary
see
whether
i
ca
find
out
as
much
as
the
man
can
he
hurried
away
from
the
house
but
soon
ceased
to
walk
fast
and
began
to
peer
sharply
about
there
a
new
building
going
up
he
said
as
he
turned
a
corner
i
find
out
about
it
so
he
did
but
it
was
only
by
the
way
he
really
had
a
plan
and
the
next
step
took
him
to
prodger
well
ogden
said
prodger
when
he
came
in
that
bay
team
has
earned
eight
dollars
and
fifty
cents
i
glad
you
brought
them
over
how
long
are
you
going
to
be
in
town
i
ca
tell
said
jack
i
staying
at
murdoch
the
editor
he
a
good
fellow
but
the
is
slow
all
dry
fodder
no
vinegar
no
pickles
he
needs
waking
up
tell
him
about
link
bridge
that
was
a
good
beginning
and
jack
soon
knew
just
how
high
the
water
had
risen
in
the
creek
at
mertonville
how
high
it
had
ever
risen
before
how
many
logs
had
been
saved
how
near
sam
hutchins
and
three
other
men
came
to
being
carried
over
the
dam
and
what
people
talked
about
doing
to
prevent
another
flood
and
other
matters
of
interest
then
he
went
among
the
who
had
been
driving
all
day
and
they
gave
him
a
number
of
items
jack
relied
mainly
upon
his
memory
but
he
soon
gathered
such
a
budget
of
facts
that
he
had
to
go
to
the
public
and
work
a
while
with
pencil
and
paper
for
fear
of
forgetting
his
treasures
out
he
went
again
and
it
was
curious
how
he
managed
to
slip
in
among
knots
of
idlers
and
set
them
to
talking
and
make
them
tell
all
they
knew
i
getting
the
news
he
said
to
himself
only
there
is
much
worth
the
time
after
a
few
moments
he
exclaimed
this
is
the
darkest
meanest
part
of
all
mertonville
it
was
the
oldest
part
of
the
village
near
the
canal
and
the
railway
station
and
many
of
the
houses
were
dilapidated
jack
was
thinking
that
mary
might
write
something
about
improving
such
a
neglected
squalid
quarter
when
he
heard
a
shriek
from
the
door
of
a
house
near
by
robbers
thieves
fire
murder
villains
it
was
the
voice
of
a
woman
and
had
a
crack
in
it
that
made
it
sound
as
if
two
voices
were
trying
to
choke
each
other
robbers
shouted
jack
springing
forward
just
as
two
very
short
men
dashed
through
the
gate
and
disappeared
in
the
darkness
if
they
were
robbers
they
were
likely
to
get
away
for
they
ran
well
jack
ogden
did
not
run
very
far
he
heard
other
footsteps
there
were
people
coming
from
the
opposite
direction
but
he
paid
no
attention
to
them
until
just
as
he
was
passing
the
gate
then
he
felt
a
hand
on
his
left
shoulder
and
another
hand
on
his
right
shoulder
and
suddenly
he
found
himself
lying
flat
on
his
back
upon
the
sidewalk
hold
him
boys
we
got
him
hold
him
down
tie
him
we
need
gag
him
tie
him
tight
we
got
him
there
were
no
less
than
four
men
and
two
held
his
legs
while
the
other
two
pinioned
his
arms
all
the
while
threatening
him
with
terrible
things
if
he
resisted
it
was
in
vain
to
struggle
and
every
time
he
tried
to
speak
they
silenced
him
besides
he
was
too
much
astonished
to
talk
easily
and
all
the
while
an
unceasing
torrent
of
abuse
was
poured
upon
him
over
the
gate
by
the
voice
that
had
given
the
alarm
we
got
him
mcnamara
he
ca
get
away
this
time
the
young
villain
they
were
goin
to
brek
into
me
house
indade
said
mcnamara
the
murdherin
vagabones
what
we
do
with
him
now
boys
asked
one
of
his
captors
i
know
where
to
take
him
do
you
deacon
abrams
what
your
name
you
young
thief
sternly
demanded
another
jack
had
begun
to
think
one
of
his
first
thoughts
was
that
a
gang
of
desperate
robbers
had
seized
him
the
next
idea
was
that
he
never
met
four
more
men
in
mertonville
nor
anywhere
else
he
resolved
that
he
would
not
tell
his
name
to
have
it
printed
in
the
and
so
made
no
answer
that
the
way
of
thim
said
mcnamara
he
game
and
he
pache
the
joodge
have
to
mak
him
spake
ye
betther
lock
him
up
and
kape
him
till
day
that
it
deacon
abrams
that
just
it
said
the
man
spoken
to
we
can
lock
him
up
in
the
back
room
of
my
house
while
we
go
and
find
the
constable
away
they
went
guarding
their
prisoner
on
the
way
as
if
they
were
afraid
of
him
they
soon
came
to
the
dwelling
of
deacon
abrams
it
was
hard
for
jack
ogden
but
he
bore
it
like
a
young
mohawk
indian
it
would
have
been
harder
if
it
had
not
been
so
late
and
if
more
of
the
household
had
been
there
to
see
him
as
it
was
doors
opened
candles
flared
old
voices
and
young
voices
asked
questions
a
baby
cried
and
then
jack
heard
a
very
sharp
voice
sakes
alive
deacon
you
ca
have
that
ruffian
here
we
shall
all
be
murdered
only
till
i
go
and
find
the
constable
jerusha
said
the
deacon
pleadingly
we
lock
him
in
the
back
room
and
barney
and
pettigrew
stand
guard
at
the
gate
with
clubs
while
smith
and
i
are
gone
there
was
another
protest
and
two
more
children
began
to
cry
but
jack
was
led
on
into
his
it
was
a
comfortable
room
containing
a
bed
and
a
chair
there
was
real
ingenuity
in
the
way
they
secured
jack
ogden
they
backed
a
chair
against
a
bedpost
and
made
him
sit
down
and
then
they
tied
the
chair
and
the
wicked
young
robber
in
it
to
the
post
there
said
deacon
abrams
he
ca
get
away
now
and
in
a
moment
more
jack
heard
the
key
turn
in
the
lock
and
he
was
left
in
the
dark
alone
and
bound
a
prisoner
under
a
charge
of
burglary
i
never
thought
of
this
thing
happening
to
me
he
said
to
himself
gritting
his
teeth
and
squirming
on
his
chair
it
pretty
hard
may
be
i
can
get
away
though
they
thought
they
pulled
the
ropes
tight
but
then
the
hempen
fetters
really
hurt
him
a
little
but
it
was
partly
because
of
the
chair
may
be
i
can
kick
it
out
from
under
me
he
said
to
himself
and
loosen
the
ropes
out
it
came
after
a
tug
and
then
jack
could
stand
up
i
might
climb
on
the
bed
now
the
ropes
are
loose
he
said
and
lift
the
loops
over
the
post
then
i
could
crawl
out
of
he
was
excited
and
worked
quickly
in
a
moment
he
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
only
his
hands
tied
behind
him
i
can
cut
that
cord
he
thought
if
i
can
find
a
nail
in
the
wall
he
easily
found
several
and
one
of
them
had
a
rough
edge
on
the
head
of
it
and
after
a
few
minutes
of
hard
sawing
the
cord
was
severed
it
easy
to
saw
twine
said
he
now
for
the
next
thing
he
went
to
the
window
and
looked
out
into
the
darkness
i
over
the
roof
of
the
kitchen
he
said
and
that
tree
close
to
it
up
went
the
window
slowly
carefully
noiselessly
and
out
crept
jack
upon
that
roof
it
was
steep
but
he
stole
along
the
ridge
now
he
could
reach
the
tree
it
an
he
said
i
can
reach
that
longest
branch
and
swing
off
and
go
down
it
hand
over
hand
at
an
ordinary
time
few
boys
would
have
thought
it
could
be
done
and
jack
had
to
gather
all
his
courage
to
make
the
attempt
but
he
slid
down
and
reached
for
that
small
frail
limb
from
his
perilous
perch
in
the
gutter
of
the
roof
now
said
jack
to
himself
off
he
went
with
a
quick
grasp
and
then
another
lower
along
the
branch
before
it
had
time
to
break
but
his
third
grip
was
on
a
larger
limb
below
and
he
believed
he
was
safe
i
must
be
quick
he
said
somebody
is
striking
a
light
in
that
room
hand
over
hand
for
a
moment
and
then
he
was
astride
of
a
limb
soon
he
was
going
down
the
trunk
and
then
the
window
which
he
had
closed
behind
him
went
up
and
he
heard
deacon
abrams
exclaiming
he
could
have
got
out
this
way
could
he
stop
thief
stop
thief
let
chase
muttered
jack
as
his
feet
reached
the
ground
this
is
the
liveliest
kind
of
jack
vaulted
over
the
nearest
fence
ran
across
a
garden
climbed
over
another
fence
ran
through
a
lot
and
came
out
into
a
street
on
the
other
side
of
the
square
i
got
a
good
start
now
he
thought
but
i
keep
right
on
they
do
expect
me
at
murdoch
if
i
can
only
get
to
the
office
nobody
hunt
for
me
there
he
heard
the
sound
of
feet
at
that
moment
around
the
next
corner
open
went
the
nearest
gate
and
in
went
jack
and
before
long
he
was
scaling
more
fences
it
just
like
playing
remarked
jack
as
he
once
more
came
out
into
a
street
now
for
the
and
it
wo
do
to
run
i
safe
he
heard
some
running
and
shouting
after
that
however
and
he
did
not
really
feel
secure
until
he
was
on
his
bed
with
the
doors
below
locked
and
barred
now
they
can
hunt
all
night
he
said
to
himself
laughing
made
plenty
of
news
for
mary
so
she
thought
next
morning
and
the
last
brought
out
the
color
in
her
cheeks
and
the
brightness
in
her
eyes
i
write
it
out
she
said
just
as
if
you
were
the
real
robber
and
we
print
it
of
course
said
jack
but
i
better
keep
shady
for
a
day
or
so
i
wish
i
was
on
my
way
to
new
york
seems
to
me
as
if
you
were
said
mary
they
wo
come
here
after
you
the
paper
nearly
full
now
and
it
be
out
murdoch
would
have
been
gratified
to
see
how
mary
and
jack
worked
that
day
even
black
and
the
worked
with
energy
and
so
did
bones
and
there
was
no
longer
any
doubt
that
the
would
be
printed
on
time
murdoch
felt
better
the
moment
he
was
told
by
mary
at
that
she
had
found
editing
no
trouble
at
all
he
was
glad
he
said
that
all
had
been
so
quiet
and
that
nobody
had
called
at
the
editor
office
and
that
people
did
not
know
he
was
sick
as
to
that
however
bones
had
not
told
mary
how
much
he
and
black
had
done
to
protect
her
from
intrusion
they
had
been
like
a
pair
of
and
it
was
hardly
possible
for
any
outsider
to
pass
them
as
for
jack
he
was
not
seen
outside
of
the
all
that
day
if
any
of
deacon
abram
posse
should
come
in
he
remarked
to
mary
they
would
know
me
with
all
the
ink
that
on
my
face
mother
would
have
to
look
twice
laughed
mary
do
i
wish
i
knew
what
people
will
think
of
the
paper
she
did
not
find
out
at
once
even
on
thursday
jack
had
the
engine
going
on
time
and
as
fast
as
papers
were
printed
the
distribution
of
them
followed
it
was
a
very
creditable
but
mary
blushed
when
she
read
in
print
the
account
murdoch
had
written
of
the
doings
in
crofield
they
think
jack
a
hero
she
said
and
what
will
they
think
of
me
and
what
will
miss
glidden
say
but
then
he
has
complimented
her
jack
too
was
much
pleased
to
read
the
vivid
accounts
she
had
written
of
the
capture
and
escape
of
the
daring
young
burglar
who
had
broken
into
the
house
of
mcnamara
and
of
the
falling
of
link
bridge
neither
of
them
however
had
an
idea
of
how
some
articles
in
the
paper
would
affect
other
people
before
noon
there
was
such
a
rush
for
at
the
front
office
that
black
got
out
another
ream
of
paper
to
print
a
second
edition
and
bones
had
almost
to
fight
to
keep
the
excited
crowd
from
going
to
see
for
themselves
whether
the
editor
was
there
before
night
poor
murdoch
went
to
the
door
thirty
times
to
say
to
eager
inquirers
that
murdoch
was
in
bed
and
that
follet
had
forbidden
him
to
see
anybody
or
to
talk
one
word
or
to
get
himself
excited
what
the
matter
with
the
people
she
said
wearily
can
it
be
possible
that
anything
the
matter
with
the
mary
ogden
said
she
taken
the
very
best
editorials
from
the
city
papers
the
was
nowhere
that
thursday
and
the
excitement
over
the
increased
all
the
afternoon
illustration
it
all
right
murdoch
said
jack
at
supper
bones
says
he
has
sold
more
than
two
hundred
extra
copies
i
glad
of
that
she
said
and
i
tell
murdoch
but
he
must
read
it
when
she
did
so
he
smiled
faintly
and
with
an
effort
feebly
responded
thank
mary
for
me
i
suppose
they
wanted
to
read
about
the
flood
bones
had
not
seen
fit
to
report
to
mary
that
a
baker
dozen
of
old
subscribers
had
ordered
their
paper
stopped
nor
that
one
angry
man
with
a
big
club
in
his
hand
had
inquired
for
the
editor
nor
that
deacon
abrams
and
the
town
constable
and
three
other
men
and
a
lawyer
had
called
to
see
the
editor
about
the
robbery
at
mcnamara
nor
that
the
same
worthy
woman
with
her
arms
akimbo
and
her
bonnet
falling
back
had
fiercely
demanded
of
him
fwhat
for
did
yez
print
all
that
about
me
howlin
wud
ony
woman
spake
was
she
bein
robbed
and
murdhered
bones
had
pacified
mcnamara
only
by
sitting
still
and
hearing
her
out
and
he
would
not
for
anything
have
mentioned
it
to
miss
ogden
she
therefore
had
only
good
news
to
tell
at
the
house
and
murdoch
replies
related
chiefly
to
the
union
church
sociable
at
judge
edwards
murdoch
is
quiet
she
said
and
he
may
sleep
all
the
time
gone
i
be
on
hand
to
look
out
for
him
said
jack
i
not
going
anywhere
that
reassured
them
as
to
leaving
home
and
murdoch
and
mary
departed
without
anxiety
but
they
had
hardly
entered
the
house
before
they
found
that
many
other
people
were
very
much
less
placid
the
first
person
to
come
forward
after
edwards
had
welcomed
them
was
miss
glidden
oh
mary
ogden
she
exclaimed
very
sweetly
and
benevolently
my
dear
why
did
you
say
so
much
about
me
in
the
that
was
murdoch
work
said
mary
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
and
that
robbery
and
escape
was
really
shocking
exactly
they
heard
a
sharp
decided
voice
near
them
and
it
came
from
a
thin
little
man
in
a
white
cravat
you
are
right
elder
holloway
when
a
leading
journal
like
the
finds
it
needful
to
denounce
so
sternly
the
state
of
the
public
streets
in
mertonville
it
is
time
for
the
people
to
act
we
ministers
must
hold
a
council
right
away
mary
remembered
a
political
editorial
she
had
taken
from
a
new
york
paper
and
had
cut
down
to
fit
the
but
its
effect
was
something
unexpected
a
deeper
voice
on
her
left
spoke
next
there
was
serious
talk
among
the
and
innkeepers
of
mobbing
the
office
that
thought
mary
must
be
the
editorial
from
that
philadelphia
weekly
we
must
judge
edwards
exclaimed
another
voice
nobody
knows
murdoch
politics
but
his
denunciation
of
the
prevailing
corruption
is
terrible
there
a
storm
rising
the
republican
committee
has
called
a
special
meeting
to
consider
the
matter
and
we
democrats
must
do
the
same
the
is
right
about
it
too
but
it
was
a
daring
step
for
him
to
take
that
the
editorial
from
the
chicago
daily
thought
mary
the
last
part
was
from
that
boston
paper
oh
dear
me
what
have
i
done
she
had
to
ask
herself
that
question
a
dozen
times
that
evening
and
she
wished
jack
had
been
there
to
hear
what
was
said
the
sociable
went
gayly
on
nevertheless
and
all
the
while
jack
sat
in
murdoch
his
face
fairly
glowing
red
with
the
interest
he
took
in
something
spread
out
upon
the
table
before
him
it
was
a
large
map
of
new
york
city
that
he
had
found
in
the
office
and
brought
to
the
house
chapter
ix
nearer
the
city
mary
ogden
would
have
withdrawn
into
some
quiet
corner
at
the
sociable
if
it
had
not
been
for
elder
holloway
and
miss
glidden
who
seemed
determined
to
prevent
her
from
being
overlooked
all
those
who
had
called
upon
murdoch
knew
that
mary
had
had
something
to
do
with
that
extraordinary
number
of
the
and
they
told
others
but
murdoch
escaped
all
discussion
about
the
by
saying
she
had
not
read
it
and
referring
every
one
to
miss
ogden
mary
was
glad
when
the
evening
was
over
after
hearing
the
comments
of
the
public
there
was
something
about
their
way
of
editing
the
paper
that
seemed
almost
dishonest
jack
was
still
up
when
she
came
home
i
used
my
time
better
than
if
i
gone
to
the
party
he
said
i
studied
the
map
of
new
york
i
know
just
how
to
go
around
if
i
was
there
i
am
going
to
study
it
all
the
time
i
here
murdoch
was
better
he
had
had
a
comfortable
night
and
felt
able
to
think
of
business
again
now
my
dear
he
said
to
his
wife
i
ready
to
take
a
look
at
the
i
am
glad
it
was
a
good
number
they
talked
about
it
all
last
evening
at
the
sociable
she
answered
as
she
handed
him
a
copy
he
was
even
cheerful
when
he
began
and
he
studied
the
paper
as
jack
had
studied
the
map
it
was
a
long
time
before
he
said
a
word
my
account
of
the
flood
is
really
capital
he
said
at
last
and
all
that
about
crofield
matters
the
report
of
things
in
mertonville
is
good
that
about
the
logs
the
dam
the
burglary
a
very
extraordinary
occurrence
by
the
way
it
a
blessing
they
did
kill
mcnamara
the
story
is
good
good
but
oh
gracious
oh
mary
ogden
oh
my
stars
what
this
he
had
begun
on
the
editorials
and
he
groaned
and
rolled
about
while
he
was
reading
them
they
mob
the
he
said
at
last
i
must
get
up
oh
but
this
is
dreadful
she
pitched
into
everything
there
is
i
must
get
up
at
once
those
editorials
were
a
strong
tonic
or
else
murdoch
illness
was
over
he
dressed
himself
and
walked
out
into
the
kitchen
his
wife
had
not
heard
him
say
he
would
get
up
but
she
seemed
almost
to
have
expected
it
it
the
way
you
always
do
she
said
i
never
much
scared
about
you
you
never
die
till
your
time
comes
i
think
mary
is
over
at
the
office
i
going
there
now
he
said
excitedly
if
this
work
goes
on
i
shall
have
the
whole
town
about
my
ears
he
was
right
mary
had
been
at
her
table
promptly
that
morning
to
make
a
beginning
on
the
next
number
jack
was
down
in
the
black
was
busy
and
bones
was
out
when
a
party
of
very
men
filed
in
went
through
the
front
office
and
climbed
the
stairs
we
show
him
said
one
it
be
a
lesson
he
wo
forget
remarked
another
fiercely
he
take
it
back
or
there
will
be
broken
bones
added
another
and
these
spoke
for
the
rest
they
had
sticks
and
they
tramped
heavily
as
they
marched
to
the
sanctum
the
foremost
opened
the
door
without
knocking
and
his
voice
was
deep
threatening
and
husky
as
he
began
now
editor
i
the
editor
sir
what
do
you
wish
of
me
illustration
i
the
editor
sir
mary
ogden
stood
before
him
looking
him
straight
in
the
face
without
a
quiver
he
was
a
big
man
but
oddly
enough
it
occurred
to
him
that
mary
seemed
larger
than
he
was
bob
exclaimed
a
harsh
whisper
behind
him
howld
yer
tongue
only
a
do
ye
say
a
word
to
the
loikes
o
her
other
whispers
and
growls
came
from
the
hall
but
the
big
man
stood
like
a
stone
post
for
several
seconds
you
the
editor
he
gasped
is
old
murdoch
dead
or
has
he
run
away
he
at
home
and
ill
said
mary

said
he
brought
a
shillalah
to
argy
wid
a
colleen
i
aff
away
he
went
stick
and
all
and
the
other
five
followed
promptly
leaving
mary
ogden
standing
still
in
amazement
she
was
trying
to
collect
her
thoughts
when
black
marched
in
from
the
other
room
followed
by
the
two
typesetters
and
bones
tumbled
out
of
breath
mary
had
hardly
any
explanation
to
make
about
what
bones
frantically
described
as
the
riot
and
she
was
inclined
to
laugh
at
it
just
then
murdoch
himself
came
to
the
door
jack
stopped
the
engine
exclaiming
murdoch
you
here
what
is
it
what
is
it
he
exclaimed
i
saw
them
go
out
did
they
break
anything
miss
ogden
scared
off
in
no
time
said
black
mary
resigned
the
editorial
chair
to
murdoch
bones
brought
in
two
office
chairs
black
appeared
with
a
very
high
stool
that
usually
stood
before
one
of
his
typecases
mary
preferred
one
of
the
office
chairs
and
there
she
sat
a
long
time
replying
to
questions
and
remarks
she
had
plenty
to
tell
after
all
she
had
heard
at
the
sociable
and
murdoch
groaned
at
times
but
still
he
thanked
her
for
her
efforts
meanwhile
black
went
to
the
with
an
errand
for
jack
that
sent
him
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
village
jack
looked
in
the
little
cracked
mirror
in
the
front
room
as
he
went
out
ink
enough
they
never
know
me
said
jack
i
safe
enough
besides
mcnamara
was
robbed
at
all
she
was
yelling
because
she
thought
robbers
were
coming
he
loitered
along
on
his
way
back
with
his
eyes
open
and
his
ears
ready
to
catch
any
bit
of
stray
news
and
paused
a
moment
to
peer
into
a
small
it
was
only
a
momentary
glance
but
a
hammer
ceased
tapping
upon
a
lapstone
and
a
tall
man
straightened
up
suddenly
and
very
straight
as
he
untied
his
leather
apron
that
the
fellow
he
exclaimed
under
his
breath
but
jack
heard
him
he
knew
me
he
knew
me
i
ca
stay
in
mertonville
thought
jack
there
be
trouble
now
he
started
at
a
run
but
it
was
so
early
that
he
attracted
little
attention
his
return
to
the
office
was
so
quick
that
black
opened
his
eyes
in
surprise
i
got
to
see
murdoch
jack
said
hurriedly
and
he
darted
to
break
right
in
upon
the
conference
between
the
editors
jack
told
his
story
and
murdoch
felt
it
was
only
another
blow
added
to
the
many
already
fallen
upon
him
and
his
perhaps
you
will
be
better
satisfied
to
leave
town
said
murdoch
uneasily
i
enough
money
to
take
me
to
the
city
and
i
go
i
off
for
new
york
said
jack
eagerly
new
york
exclaimed
murdoch
that
the
thing
go
to
the
house
and
get
ready
i
buy
you
a
ticket
to
albany
and
you
can
go
down
on
the
night
boat
they
taking
passengers
for
half
a
dollar
you
must
be
caught
no
doubt
they
are
hunting
for
you
now
murdoch
was
right
at
that
very
moment
the
cobbler
was
in
the
grocery
kept
by
deacon
abrams
shouting
we
got
him
again
deacon
he
in
town
he
works
in
a
paint
shop
had
paint
on
his
face
or
else
he
a
blacksmith
or
he
works
in
coal
or
something
black
or
dusty
we
can
run
him
down
now
while
they
went
for
the
two
others
who
knew
jack
face
he
was
putting
on
his
sunday
clothes
and
packing
up
when
he
came
down
there
was
no
ink
upon
his
face
his
collar
was
clean
his
hair
was
brushed
and
he
was
a
complete
surprise
to
black
and
the
rest
i
can
get
a
new
boy
said
murdoch
as
if
he
were
beginning
to
recover
his
spirits
and
i
can
run
the
engine
myself
now
i
well
i
can
say
in
the
next
that
you
are
gone
to
the
city
and
that
will
help
me
out
of
my
troubles
neither
jack
nor
mary
quite
understood
what
he
meant
and
in
fact
they
were
not
thinking
about
him
just
then
murdoch
had
said
that
there
was
only
time
to
catch
the
and
they
were
saying
mary
was
crying
for
the
moment
and
jack
was
telling
her
what
to
write
to
his
mother
and
father
and
those
at
home
in
crofield
it
so
sudden
jack
said
mary
but
i
glad
you
going
i
wish
i
could
go
too
i
wish
you
could
said
jack
heartily
but
i
write
i
tell
you
everything
murdoch
waiting
the
editor
was
indeed
waiting
and
he
was
very
uneasy
what
a
calamity
it
would
be
he
thought
to
have
my
own
arrested
for
burglary
the
would
enjoy
that
it
is
jack
fault
but
i
ca
bear
everything
meanwhile
mary
sat
at
the
table
and
pretended
to
look
among
the
papers
for
a
new
story
but
really
she
was
trying
to
keep
from
crying
over
jack
departure
murdoch
and
jack
had
gone
to
the
station
there
was
cunning
in
the
plans
of
the
pursuers
of
burglar
this
time
three
of
them
each
aided
by
several
eager
volunteers
dashed
around
mertonville
searching
every
shop
in
which
any
sort
of
might
be
used
and
deacon
abrams
himself
went
to
the
station
with
a
justice
of
the
peace
a
a
constable
and
the
man
that
kept
the
village
pound
he
wo
get
by
said
the
deacon
wisely
as
murdoch
and
a
neatly
dressed
young
gentleman
passed
him
arm
in
arm
good
morning
murdoch
the
improving
you
did
me
justice
we
after
that
same
villain
now
we
get
him
this
time
too
deacon
said
the
editor
gripping
jack
arm
hard
i
mention
your
courage
and
public
spirit
again
tie
him
tighter
next
time
we
will
said
the
deacon
and
i
got
some
new
subscribers
for
you
and
a
column
advertisement
murdoch
hurried
to
the
and
jack
patiently
looked
away
from
deacon
abrams
all
the
while
there
said
murdoch
jump
right
in
keep
your
satchel
with
you
i
going
back
to
the
office
illustration
there
said
murdoch
jump
right
in
said
jack
pocketing
his
ticket
and
entering
the
car
he
took
a
seat
by
the
open
window
just
as
the
train
started
jack
gone
mary
exclaimed
murdoch
under
his
breath
as
he
the
office
have
those
men
been
here
again
no
said
mary
but
the
chairmen
of
the
two
central
committees
have
both
been
here
elder
holloway
said
they
would
they
will
call
again
what
did
you
say
the
editor
asked
why
replied
mary
i
told
them
you
were
just
getting
well
so
i
am
said
murdoch
there
a
great
demand
for
that
number
of
the
old
subscribers
have
stopped
their
papers
but
a
hundred
and
new
ones
have
come
in
i
ca
guess
where
this
will
end
are
you
going
to
the
house
i
think
i
better
said
mary
if
there
anything
more
i
can
do
no
no
no
do
spoil
your
visit
said
he
hastily
you
had
work
enough
now
you
must
be
free
to
rest
a
little
and
meet
your
friends
he
would
not
say
he
was
afraid
to
have
her
in
the
office
to
stir
up
storms
for
him
but
mary
made
no
objection
she
was
very
willing
to
give
up
the
work
murdoch
came
home
in
a
more
hopeful
state
of
mind
but
soon
went
to
his
room
and
lay
down
my
dear
he
said
to
his
wife
the
paper
going
right
along
but
too
much
exhausted
to
see
anybody
tell
all
i
not
well
mary
was
uneasy
about
jack
but
she
need
not
have
worried
the
moment
the
train
was
in
motion
he
forgot
even
deacon
abrams
and
mcnamara
in
the
grand
thought
that
he
was
actually
on
his
way
to
the
city
this
train
an
express
train
he
said
to
himself
does
she
go
i
said
i
get
there
some
day
and
now
i
really
going
hurrah
for
new
york
it
good
i
learned
something
about
the
streets
i
know
what
to
do
when
i
get
there
he
had
nine
dollars
in
his
pocket
for
capital
but
he
knew
more
or
less
of
several
businesses
and
trades
in
the
seat
in
front
of
him
were
two
gentlemen
who
must
have
been
railway
men
he
thought
from
what
they
said
and
it
occurred
to
jack
that
he
would
like
to
learn
how
to
build
a
railway
the
train
stopped
at
last
after
a
long
journey
and
a
man
got
in
came
straight
to
jack
seat
took
the
hitherto
empty
half
of
it
and
began
to
talk
with
the
men
in
front
as
if
he
had
come
on
board
for
the
purpose
at
first
jack
paid
little
attention
but
soon
they
began
to
mention
places
he
knew
so
far
so
good
remarked
the
man
at
his
side
but
we
going
to
have
trouble
in
getting
the
right
of
way
through
crofield
we
have
to
pay
a
big
price
for
that
hotel
if
we
ca
use
the
street
i
think
not
said
jack
with
a
smile
there
is
much
hotel
left
in
crofield
now
it
was
burned
down
last
sunday
what
exclaimed
one
of
the
gentlemen
in
front
are
you
from
crofield
i
live
there
said
jack
your
engineer
was
there
about
the
time
of
the
fire
the
old
bridge
is
down
i
heard
him
say
that
your
line
would
cross
just
below
it
the
three
gentlemen
were
all
attention
and
the
one
who
had
not
before
spoken
said
i
know
through
the
old
hammond
property
it
used
to
belong
to
hammond
replied
jack
but
it
belongs
to
my
father
now
can
you
give
me
a
list
of
the
other
owners
of
property
asked
the
railway
man
with
some
interest
i
can
tell
you
who
owns
every
acre
around
crofield
boundary
lines
and
all
answered
jack
i
was
born
there
you
do
know
about
the
people
though
they
do
almost
anything
to
have
the
road
there
my
father
will
help
all
he
can
he
says
the
place
is
dead
now
what
his
name
asked
the
first
speaker
with
a
notebook
and
a
pencil
in
his
hand
his
is
john
ogden
mine
jack
ogden
my
father
knows
every
man
in
the
county
replied
jack
ogden
said
the
gentleman
in
the
forward
seat
next
the
window
my
name
magruder
we
three
are
directors
in
the
new
road
i
a
director
in
this
road
are
you
to
stay
in
albany
i
go
by
the
night
boat
to
new
york
said
jack
almost
proudly
can
you
stay
over
a
day
we
entertain
you
at
the
delavan
house
if
you
give
us
some
information
certainly
i
be
glad
to
said
jack
and
so
when
the
train
stopped
at
albany
jack
was
talking
familiarly
enough
with
the
three
railway
directors
mary
ogden
had
a
very
clear
idea
that
murdoch
preferred
to
make
up
the
next
paper
without
any
help
from
her
and
even
murdoch
was
almost
glad
to
know
that
her
young
friend
was
to
spend
the
next
week
with
edwards
one
peculiar
occurrence
of
that
day
had
not
been
reported
at
the
office
and
it
had
consequences
the
committee
of
six
who
had
visited
the
sanctum
so
threateningly
went
away
beaten
but
recounted
their
experience
they
did
so
in
the
office
of
the
mertonville
hotel
and
mike
flaherty
had
more
than
a
little
to
say
about
that
gurril
and
about
the
black
eyes
of
her
and
the
plucky
way
in
which
she
had
faced
them
one
little
old
gentleman
whose
eyes
were
still
bright
in
spite
of
his
gray
hair
stood
in
the
door
and
listened
with
his
hand
behind
his
ear
gentlemen
exclaimed
this
little
old
man
turning
to
the
men
behind
him
did
you
hear
i
guess
i
know
what
we
ought
to
do
come
on
into
crozier
with
me
all
of
you
we
must
give
her
a
testimonial
for
her
pluck
crozier
asked
a
portly
man
nothing
there
but
come
jeroliman
you
a
banker
and
you
needed
i
dare
you
to
come
said
the
little
old
man
jokingly
leading
the
way
seven
of
them
reached
the
counter
of
the
largest
store
in
mertonville
and
here
the
little
old
gentleman
bought
black
silk
for
a
dress
you
brought
your
friends
i
see
general
smith
said
the
merchant
laughing
one
of
your
jokes
eh
no
joke
at
all
crozier
a
testimonial
of
esteem
and
three
gentlemen
helped
one
another
to
tell
the
story
i
make
a
good
reduction
for
my
share
exclaimed
the
merchant
as
he
added
up
the
figures
of
the
bill
will
that
do
general
i
join
in
promptly
interposed
jeroliman
the
banker
laughing
i
wo
take
a
dare
from
general
smith
come
boys
they
were
old
enough
boys
but
they
all
chipped
in
and
general
smith
dare
did
not
cost
him
much
after
all
mary
ogden
had
the
map
of
new
york
out
upon
the
table
that
evening
and
was
examining
it
when
there
came
a
ring
at
the
it
a
boy
from
crozier
with
a
package
said
murdoch
and
mary
it
for
you
for
me
said
mary
in
blank
astonishment
it
was
indeed
addressed
to
her
and
contained
a
short
note
the
girl
who
was
not
afraid
of
six
angry
men
is
requested
to
accept
this
silk
dress
with
the
compliments
of
her
admiring
friends
seven
old
men
of
mertonville
oh
but
murdoch
said
mary
in
confusion
i
do
know
what
to
say
or
do
it
very
kind
of
them
but
ought
i
to
take
it
this
testimonial
pleased
murdoch
even
more
than
it
pleased
mary
he
insisted
mary
should
keep
it
and
she
at
last
consented
but
not
even
the
new
dress
made
mary
forget
to
wonder
how
jack
was
faring
the
lightning
express
made
short
work
of
the
trip
to
albany
and
jack
was
glad
of
it
for
he
had
not
had
any
dinner
his
new
acquaintances
invited
him
to
accompany
them
to
the
delavan
house
as
they
left
the
station
magruder
took
from
his
pocket
a
small
pamphlet
humph
he
said
to
the
new
york
city
and
hudson
river
i
had
forgotten
that
i
had
it
do
you
want
it
ogden
it
be
something
to
read
on
the
boat
wo
you
keep
it
asked
jack
hesitating
oh
no
said
magruder
i
was
going
to
throw
it
away
so
jack
put
the
book
into
his
pocket
it
was
a
short
walk
to
the
delavan
house
but
it
was
through
more
bustle
and
business
considering
how
quiet
everybody
was
jack
thought
than
he
ever
saw
before
he
went
with
the
rest
to
the
hotel
office
and
heard
magruder
give
directions
about
jack
room
and
bill
he
going
to
pay
for
me
for
one
day
jack
said
to
himself
and
until
the
evening
boat
goes
ogden
said
magruder
i
ca
ask
you
to
dine
with
us
it
a
private
party
have
your
dinner
and
then
wait
for
me
here
all
right
said
jack
and
then
he
stood
still
and
tried
to
think
what
to
do
i
must
go
to
my
room
now
and
leave
my
satchel
there
he
said
to
himself
i
do
want
anybody
to
know
i
never
was
in
a
big
hotel
before
he
managed
to
get
to
his
room
without
making
a
single
blunder
but
the
moment
he
closed
the
door
he
felt
awed
and
put
down
it
the
finest
room
i
was
ever
in
in
all
my
life
he
exclaimed
they
must
have
made
a
mistake
perhaps
i
have
a
bedroom
like
this
in
my
own
house
some
day
jack
made
himself
look
as
neat
as
if
he
had
come
out
of
a
bandbox
before
he
went
the
was
easily
found
and
he
was
shown
to
a
seat
at
one
of
the
tables
and
a
bill
of
fare
was
handed
him
but
that
was
only
one
more
puzzle
i
do
know
what
some
of
these
are
he
said
to
himself
i
try
things
i
could
get
in
crofield
i
begin
on
those
clams
with
little
necks
so
the
waiter
set
before
him
a
plate
of
six
raw
clams
that
was
a
good
beginning
for
every
one
of
them
seemed
to
speak
to
him
of
the
salt
ocean
after
that
he
went
farther
down
the
bill
of
fare
and
selected
such
dishes
as
he
said
nobody
ever
saw
in
crofield
it
was
a
grand
dinner
and
jack
was
almost
afraid
he
had
been
too
long
over
it
he
went
out
to
the
office
and
looked
around
and
asked
the
clerk
if
magruder
had
been
inquiring
for
him
not
yet
ogden
said
the
clerk
he
is
not
yet
through
dinner
did
you
find
your
room
all
right
all
right
said
jack
i
sit
down
and
wait
for
mr
magruder
it
was
an
hour
before
the
railway
gentlemen
returned
there
were
twice
as
many
of
them
now
however
and
magruder
remarked
come
ogden
we
wo
detain
you
long
after
that
you
can
do
what
you
like
thank
you
very
much
too
jack
followed
them
into
a
private
which
seemed
to
him
so
richly
furnished
that
he
really
wished
it
had
been
plainer
but
he
found
the
men
very
straightforward
about
their
business
they
all
sat
down
around
the
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
we
finish
ogden
first
and
let
him
go
said
magruder
laughing
ogden
here
a
map
of
crofield
and
all
the
country
from
there
to
mertonville
i
want
to
ask
some
questions
he
knew
what
to
ask
too
but
jack
first
remark
was
not
an
answer
your
map
all
wrong
said
he
there
is
sand
and
gravel
in
that
hill
across
the
cocahutchie
beyond
the
bridge
illustration
your
map
all
wrong
said
what
is
there
then
asked
a
gentleman
who
seemed
to
be
one
of
the
civil
engineers
pettishly
i
say
it
earth
and
gravel
mainly
clear
granite
said
jack
go
down
stream
a
little
and
you
see
all
right
exclaimed
magruder
it
will
be
costly
cutting
it
but
we
shall
want
the
stone
go
ahead
now
you
just
the
man
we
needed
jack
thought
so
before
they
got
through
for
he
had
to
tell
all
there
was
to
tell
about
the
country
away
down
to
link
bridge
look
here
said
one
of
them
quizzically
ogden
have
you
lived
all
your
life
in
every
house
in
crofield
and
in
mertonville
and
everywhere
you
know
even
the
and
well
i
know
some
of
said
jack
coloring
and
trying
to
join
in
the
general
laugh
i
would
talk
so
much
but
magruder
asked
me
to
stay
over
and
tell
what
you
did
know
then
the
laughter
broke
out
again
and
it
was
not
at
jack
expense
they
had
learned
all
they
expected
from
him
however
and
magruder
thanked
him
very
heartily
i
hope
you
have
a
good
time
he
said
look
at
the
city
i
see
that
you
have
a
ticket
ready
for
the
boat
i
did
expect
began
jack
nonsense
ogden
said
magruder
we
owe
you
a
great
deal
my
boy
i
would
have
missed
knowing
about
that
granite
ledge
worth
something
to
us
the
ticket
will
be
handed
you
by
the
clerk
jack
ogden
i
hope
i
see
you
again
some
day
i
hope
so
said
jack
sir
gentlemen
out
he
walked
and
as
the
door
closed
behind
him
the
engineer
remarked
he
ought
to
be
a
railway
contractor
brightest
young
fellow
i
seen
in
a
long
time
jack
felt
strange
the
old
feeling
seemed
to
have
been
questioned
out
of
him
by
those
keen
peremptory
business
men
and
he
appeared
to
himself
to
be
a
very
small
green
poor
uneducated
boy
who
hardly
knew
where
he
was
going
next
or
what
he
was
going
to
do
when
he
got
there
i
do
know
about
that
either
he
said
to
himself
when
he
reached
the
office
i
know
i
going
to
bed
next
and
i
believe
that
i
go
to
sleep
when
i
get
there
weary
very
weary
and
almost
blue
in
spite
of
everything
was
jack
ogden
that
night
when
he
crept
into
bed
is
like
that
old
cot
in
the
office
he
thought
glad
it
is
to
be
paid
for
out
of
my
nine
dollars
jack
was
tired
all
over
and
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
sound
asleep
he
had
gone
to
bed
quite
early
and
he
awoke
with
the
first
sunshine
that
came
pouring
into
his
room
it
is
time
to
get
up
he
said
it
be
ever
so
long
before
breakfast
but
i
ca
stay
here
in
bed
as
he
put
on
his
coat
something
swung
against
his
side
and
he
said
there
i
forgotten
that
pamphlet
i
see
what
in
it
the
excitement
of
getting
to
the
delavan
house
and
the
dinner
and
the
talk
afterward
had
driven
the
pamphlet
out
of
his
mind
until
then
but
he
opened
it
eagerly
good
he
said
as
he
turned
the
leaves
maps
and
pictures
all
the
way
down
everything
about
the
hudson
pictures
of
all
the
places
worth
seeing
in
new
york
tells
all
about
them
where
to
go
when
you
get
there
just
what
i
wanted
down
he
sat
and
he
came
near
forgetting
his
breakfast
so
intensely
was
he
absorbed
by
that
he
shut
it
up
at
last
however
remarking
i
have
breakfast
and
then
i
go
out
and
see
albany
it
all
i
got
to
do
till
the
boat
leaves
this
evening
first
city
i
ever
saw
he
ate
with
all
the
more
satisfaction
because
he
knew
that
he
was
not
eating
up
any
part
of
his
nine
dollars
and
it
did
not
seem
like
so
much
money
as
it
would
have
seemed
in
crofield
he
was
in
no
haste
for
he
had
no
idea
where
to
go
and
did
not
mean
to
tell
anybody
how
ignorant
he
was
he
walked
out
of
the
delavan
house
and
strolled
away
to
the
right
even
the
poorer
buildings
were
far
better
than
anything
in
crofield
or
mertonville
and
he
soon
had
a
bit
of
a
surprise
he
reached
a
corner
where
a
very
broad
street
opened
at
the
right
and
went
up
a
steep
hill
it
was
not
a
very
long
street
and
it
ended
at
the
crest
of
the
hill
where
there
were
some
trees
and
above
them
towered
what
seemed
to
be
a
magnificent
palace
of
a
building
i
go
and
see
that
said
jack
i
know
what
it
is
when
i
see
the
sign
or
i
ask
somebody
his
interest
in
that
piece
of
architecture
grew
as
he
walked
on
up
the
hill
and
he
was
a
little
warm
and
out
of
breath
when
he
reached
the
street
corner
at
the
top
upon
the
corner
with
his
hands
folded
behind
him
and
his
hat
pushed
back
on
his
head
stood
a
man
somewhat
above
middle
height
heavily
built
and
portly
who
seemed
to
be
gazing
at
the
same
object
mister
said
jack
will
you
please
tell
me
what
that
building
is
certainly
replied
the
gentleman
turning
to
him
with
a
bow
and
a
smile
that
the
new
york
state
miracle
one
of
the
wonders
of
the
world
the
state
miracle
said
jack
what
your
name
asked
the
gentleman
with
another
bow
and
smile
ogden
jack
ogden
yes
jack
ogden
thank
you
my
name
that
a
miracle
it
can
never
be
finished
there
magic
in
it
do
you
know
what
that
is
that
one
of
the
things
i
do
know
guvner
said
jack
i
do
know
what
it
is
either
smiled
guvner
when
they
built
it
they
put
in
twenty
tons
of
pure
solid
gold
my
lad
did
you
ever
hear
of
it
where
do
you
live
when
you
at
home
my
home
in
crofield
said
jack
not
aware
of
a
group
of
gentlemen
and
ladies
who
were
standing
still
a
few
yards
away
looking
at
them
i
on
my
way
to
new
york
but
i
wanted
to
see
albany
guvner
put
a
large
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
smiled
in
his
face
jack
my
son
he
said
go
up
and
look
all
over
the
state
miracle
many
other
states
have
other
similar
miracles
do
stay
in
it
too
long
though
is
it
unhealthy
asked
jack
with
a
smile
the
portly
gentleman
was
smiling
also
no
no
not
unhealthy
my
boy
but
they
persuade
some
men
to
stay
there
a
long
time
and
they
never
the
same
men
again
come
out
as
soon
as
you
had
a
good
view
of
it
i
take
a
look
at
it
any
way
said
jack
turning
away
thank
you
guvner
i
see
the
miracle
he
had
gone
but
a
few
paces
and
the
others
were
stepping
forward
when
he
was
called
by
guvner
jack
come
back
a
moment
what
is
it
mr
guvner
asked
jack
i
almost
sorry
you
going
to
the
city
it
as
bad
as
the
capitol
itself
you
never
be
the
same
man
again
do
get
to
be
the
wrong
kind
of
man
i
remember
guvner
said
jack
and
he
walked
away
again
but
as
he
did
so
he
heard
a
lady
laughing
and
a
gentlemen
saying
good
morning
a
very
fine
morning
i
declare
exclaimed
jack
with
almost
a
shiver
i
been
talking
with
the
governor
of
the
state
himself
and
i
going
to
see
the
capitol
i
could
have
done
that
in
crofield
and
i
be
in
new
york
city
chapter
x
the
and
the
steamboat
mary
ogden
had
three
dresses
one
quite
pretty
but
none
were
of
silk
aunt
melinda
was
always
telling
mary
what
she
ought
not
to
wear
at
her
age
and
with
hair
and
eyes
as
dark
as
hers
mary
felt
very
proud
therefore
when
she
saw
on
the
table
in
her
room
the
parcel
containing
the
black
silk
and
trimmings
it
must
have
been
expensive
she
said
and
she
unfolded
it
as
if
afraid
it
would
break
what
will
mother
say
she
thought
and
aunt
melinda
i
too
young
for
it
i
know
i
am
the
whole
murdoch
family
arose
early
and
the
editor
after
looking
at
the
black
silk
said
that
he
felt
pretty
well
so
you
ought
said
his
wife
you
had
more
new
subscribers
yesterday
than
you
ever
had
before
in
your
life
in
any
one
day
that
makes
me
think
said
murdoch
i
owe
mary
ogden
five
dollars
there
it
is
for
getting
out
that
number
of
the
oh
no
exclaimed
mary
i
did
that
and
jack
did
it
only
because
he
put
the
into
her
hand
i
rather
you
take
it
he
said
you
never
be
a
good
editor
till
you
learn
to
work
on
a
business
basis
as
he
insisted
she
put
the
bill
into
her
thanking
him
gratefully
i
had
two
dollars
when
i
came
she
thought
and
i
have
spent
a
cent
but
i
may
need
something
besides
i
have
to
pay
for
making
up
my
new
dress
but
she
was
wrong
murdoch
went
out
to
see
a
neighbor
after
breakfast
and
before
noon
it
was
certain
that
if
seven
old
men
of
mertonville
had
paid
for
the
silk
at
least
seven
elderly
women
could
be
found
who
were
very
willing
to
make
it
up
about
that
time
jack
was
walking
up
to
the
door
of
the
senate
chamber
in
the
capitol
at
albany
after
having
astonished
himself
by
long
walks
and
gazings
through
the
halls
and
side
passages
it
true
enough
he
said
to
himself
the
governor
right
no
fellow
could
go
through
this
and
come
out
just
as
he
came
in
he
understood
about
the
twenty
tons
of
pure
gold
in
the
building
but
nevertheless
he
could
not
keep
from
looking
all
around
after
signs
of
it
there
plenty
of
gilding
he
said
but
it
very
thin
it
all
finished
too
i
do
see
what
more
they
could
do
now
the
roof
on
and
it
all
painted
he
must
have
been
joking
when
he
said
that
jack
roamed
all
over
the
capitol
for
the
legislature
was
not
in
session
and
the
building
was
open
to
there
were
many
of
them
and
from
visitors
workmen
and
some
boys
whom
he
met
jack
managed
to
find
out
many
interesting
things
the
assembly
chamber
seemed
to
him
a
truly
wonderful
room
and
upon
the
floor
were
several
groups
of
people
admiring
it
he
saw
one
visitor
seat
himself
in
the
speaker
chair
there
room
in
that
chair
for
two
or
three
small
men
said
jack
i
try
it
by
and
by
so
he
did
the
speaker
was
a
boy
once
too
and
so
was
the
governor
he
said
to
himself
aloud
yes
my
boy
said
a
lady
who
was
near
enough
to
hear
him
so
they
were
so
were
all
the
presidents
and
some
went
barefoot
and
lived
in
well
i
often
gone
barefoot
said
jack
laughing
many
boys
go
barefoot
but
they
ca
all
become
governors
she
said
pleasantly
she
looked
at
jack
for
a
moment
and
then
said
with
a
smile
you
look
like
a
bright
young
man
though
do
you
suppose
you
could
ever
be
governor
perhaps
i
could
he
said
it
ca
be
harder
to
learn
than
any
other
business
the
lady
laughed
and
her
friends
laughed
and
jack
arose
from
the
speaker
chair
and
walked
away
he
had
seen
enough
of
that
vast
state
house
it
wearied
him
there
was
so
much
of
it
and
it
was
so
fine
to
build
this
house
cost
twenty
tons
of
gold
he
said
as
he
went
out
through
the
lofty
doorway
i
wish
i
had
some
of
it
i
kept
my
nine
dollars
yet
anyway
the
governor
right
i
do
know
what
he
meant
but
i
never
be
just
the
same
fellow
again
it
was
so
but
it
was
not
merely
seeing
the
capitol
that
had
changed
him
he
was
changing
from
a
boy
who
had
never
seen
anything
outside
of
crofield
and
mertonville
into
a
boy
who
was
walking
right
out
into
the
world
to
learn
what
is
in
it
i
go
to
the
hotel
and
write
to
father
and
mother
he
said
and
i
have
something
to
tell
them
it
was
the
first
real
letter
he
had
ever
written
and
it
seemed
a
great
thing
to
do
ten
times
more
important
than
writing
a
composition
and
almost
equal
to
editing
the
i
just
put
in
everything
he
thought
just
as
it
came
along
and
they
know
what
i
been
doing
it
took
a
long
time
to
write
the
letter
but
it
was
done
at
last
and
when
he
put
down
his
pen
he
exclaimed
hard
work
always
makes
me
hungry
i
wonder
if
it
is
they
said
it
was
always
here
after
twelve
i
go
see
it
was
long
after
twelve
when
he
went
down
to
the
office
to
stamp
and
mail
his
letter
ogden
said
the
clerk
giving
jack
an
envelope
here
a
note
from
magruder
he
left
ogden
said
a
deep
full
voice
just
behind
him
did
you
stay
there
too
long
i
am
told
you
sat
in
the
speaker
chair
jack
wheeled
about
blushing
crimson
the
governor
was
not
standing
still
but
was
walking
steadily
through
the
office
surrounded
by
a
group
of
dignified
men
it
was
necessary
to
walk
with
them
in
order
to
reply
to
the
question
and
jack
did
so
i
sat
there
half
a
minute
he
answered
i
hope
it
did
hurt
me
i
glad
you
got
out
so
soon
jack
replied
the
governor
approvingly
but
i
heard
also
that
you
think
of
learning
the
governor
business
went
on
the
great
man
now
do
you
do
it
it
is
not
large
pay
and
you
be
out
of
work
most
of
the
time
be
a
blacksmith
or
a
carpenter
or
a
tailor
or
a
printer
well
governor
said
jack
i
was
brought
up
a
blacksmith
and
worked
at
carpentering
and
printing
too
and
i
edited
a
newspaper
but
there
he
was
cut
short
by
the
laughter
from
those
dignified
men
jack
said
the
governor
shaking
hands
with
him
i
hope
you
have
a
good
time
in
the
city
you
be
sent
back
to
the
capitol
some
day
perhaps
jack
returned
to
the
clerk
counter
to
mail
his
letter
and
found
that
gentleman
looking
at
him
as
if
he
wondered
what
sort
of
a
boy
he
might
be
illustration
hotel
clerk
looked
at
that
young
fellow
knows
all
the
politicians
said
the
clerk
to
one
of
the
hotel
proprietors
he
ca
be
so
countrified
as
he
looks
after
dinner
jack
returned
to
his
room
for
a
long
look
at
the
he
went
through
it
rapidly
to
the
last
leaf
and
then
threw
it
down
remarking
i
never
was
so
tired
i
take
a
walk
around
and
see
albany
a
little
more
and
i
not
be
sorry
when
the
boat
goes
i
like
to
see
mary
and
the
rest
for
an
hour
or
two
i
think
they
like
to
see
me
coming
in
too
jack
sauntered
on
through
street
after
street
getting
a
clearer
idea
of
what
a
city
was
he
walked
so
far
that
he
had
some
difficulty
in
returning
to
the
hotel
but
finally
he
found
it
without
asking
directions
soon
after
jack
brought
down
his
satchel
said
to
the
very
polite
clerk
and
walked
out
he
had
learned
the
way
to
the
and
he
had
already
taken
one
brief
look
at
the
river
and
the
railway
bridge
there
the
he
said
aloud
as
he
turned
a
street
corner
and
came
in
sight
of
her
what
a
boat
why
if
her
nose
was
at
the
main
street
corner
by
the
washington
hotel
her
rudder
would
be
across
the
cocahutchie
he
walked
the
wharf
staring
at
her
from
end
to
end
before
he
went
on
board
he
had
put
magruder
note
into
his
pocket
without
reading
it
i
wo
open
it
here
he
had
said
then
there
nothing
in
it
but
a
ticket
he
found
however
that
he
must
show
the
ticket
at
the
gangway
and
so
he
opened
the
envelope
three
tickets
he
said
and
two
are
in
one
piece
this
one
is
for
a
stateroom
that
the
bunk

i
well
i
not
sorry
have
to
hurry
too
it
about
time
for
her
to
start
jack
went
on
board
and
soon
was
hunting
for
his
stateroom
almost
bewildered
by
the
rushing
crowd
in
the
great
saloon
he
had
his
key
and
knew
the
number
but
it
seemed
that
there
were
about
a
thousand
of
the
little
doors
one
hundred
and
is
mine
he
said
and
i
going
to
put
away
my
satchel
and
go
on
deck
and
see
the
river
here
it
is
at
last
why
it
a
kind
of
little
bedroom
it
as
good
as
a
floating
hotel
now
i
all
right
suddenly
he
was
aware
with
a
great
thrill
of
pleasure
that
the
columbia
was
in
motion
he
left
his
satchel
in
a
corner
locked
the
door
of
the
stateroom
behind
him
and
set
out
to
find
his
way
to
the
deck
he
went
and
ran
against
people
and
was
run
against
by
them
and
it
occurred
to
him
that
all
the
passengers
were
hunting
for
something
they
could
not
find
looking
for
staterooms
i
guess
he
remarked
aloud
but
he
himself
should
not
have
been
staring
behind
him
for
at
that
moment
he
felt
the
whack
of
a
collision
and
a
pair
of
heavy
arms
grasped
him
what
you
looks
vor
yourself
poy
you
knocks
my
breath
out
you
find
somebody
you
looks
vor
eh
the
tremendous
man
who

him

not
tall
but
very
heavy
and
had
a
broad
face
and
long
black
beard
and
shaggy
gray
eyebrows
beg
pardon
exclaimed
jack
with
a
glance
at
a
lady
holding
one
of
the
man
long
arms
and
at
two
other
ladies
following
them

eh
the
ladies
looked
genuinely
distressed
and
said
a
number
of
things
to
each
other
in
some
tongue
that
jack
did
not
understand
he
had
been
proud
enough
of
his
stateroom
up
to
that
moment
but
he
felt
his
heart
melting
besides
he
had
intended
to
sit
up
a
long
while
to
see
the
river
i
can
fix
it
he
suddenly
exclaimed
let
the
ladies
take

stateroom

big
enough
poy
said
the
german
solemnly

not

about

he
said
then
i
going
out
on
deck
ve
comes
said
the
wide
german
and
the
three
ladies
all
tried
to
express
their
thanks
at
the
same
time
as
jack
led
the
way
jack
was
proud
of
his
success
in
actually
finding
his
own
door
again

they
all
talked
a
great
deal
and
jack
managed
to
reduce
the
polish
lady
name
to
miss
podgoomski
but
he
felt
uneasily
that
he
had
left
out
a
part
of
it
guilderaufenberg
and
the
others
were
loaded
up
with
more
parcels
and
baggage
than
jack
had
ever

but
again
jack
had
failed
to
hear
that
polish
lady
name
chapter
xi
down
the
hudson
jack
already
felt
well
acquainted
with
guilderaufenberg
the
broad
and
bearded
german
knew
all
about
steamboats
and
found
his
way
out
upon
the
forward
deck
without
any
difficulty
jack
had
lost
his
way
entirely
in
his
first
hunting
for
that
spot
and
he
was
glad
to
find
himself
under
the
awning
and
gazing
down
the
river
ve
only

jack
was
startled
for
a
moment
the
bland
face
of
his
german
acquaintance
had
suddenly
changed
his
white
teeth
showed
through
his
mushtaches
and
his
beard
seemed
to
wave
and
curl
as
he
spoke
of
the
police
for
one
moment
jack
thought
of
deacon
abram
and
mcnamara
of
the
dark
room
and
the
ropes
and
the
window
he
may
not
have
done
anything
he
said
to
himself
aloud
any
more
than
i
did
and
they
were
after
me
dot

guilderaufenberg

jack
brain
was
in
a
whirl
he
had
read
about
all
of
those
cities
and
here
was
a
man
who
had
really
been
in
them
it
was
even
more
wonderful
than
talking
with
the
governor
or
looking
at
the
hudson
but
in
a
moment
his
new
friend
face
assumed
a
quieter
expression
come
along
he
said
de
ladies
ees
ready
by
dees

dells
you
some

you

hear
he
seemed
to
know
all
about
the
columbia
for
he
led
jack
straight
to
the
stateroom
door
through
all
the
crowds
of
passengers
i
might
not
have
found
it
in
less
than
an
hour
said
jack
to
himself
they
waiting
for
us
i
ca
talk
with
them
much
but
he
found
out
that
guilderaufenberg
spoke
english
with
but
little
accent
miss
hildebrand
only
knocked
over
a
letter
here
and
there
and
the
polish
lady
fluent
english
astonished
him
so
much
that
he
complimented
her
upon
it
dot
ees
so
remarked
guilderaufenberg
she
talks
dem
all
so
vell
dey
say
she

ven
you

bolish
or
russian
den
you
vas
exercise
your
tongue
so
you
shpeaks
all
de
oder
lankwitches
easy
the
ladies
were
in
good
humor
and
disposed
to
laugh
at
anything
especially
after
they
reached
the
and
guilderaufenberg
at
once
took
a
strong
interest
in
jack
because
he
had
never
been
anywhere
for
convenience
perhaps
the
ladies
frequently
spoke
to
one
another
in
german
but
jack
without
understanding
a
word
of
it
listened
earnestly
to
what
they
were
saying
they
often
however
talked
in
english
and
to
him
and
he
learned
that
they
had
been
making
a
trip
through
canada
and
were
now
on
their
way
home
it
was
evident
that
guilderaufenberg
was
a
man
who
did
not
lack
money
and
that
none
of
the
others
were
poor
besides
hearing
them
jack
was
busy
in
looking
around
the
long
glittering
of
the
columbia
noticing
how
many
different
kinds
of
people
there
were
in
it
they
seemed
to
be
of
all
nations
ages
colors
and
kinds
and
jack
would
not
have
missed
the
sight
for
anything
i
beginning
to
see
the
world
he
said
to
himself
and
then
he
had
to
reply
to
guilderaufenberg
for
about
the
twentieth
time
oh
not
at
all
you
welcome
to
the
stateroom
i
rather
sit
up
and
look
at
the
river
than
go
to
bed
den
ogden
she
said

and
you
comes
to
my
house
i
can
den
repay
your
kindness
you
vill
see
senators
congressmen
generals
fine
men
great
men
in
vashington
after
supper
the
party
found
seats
under
the
awning
forward
and
for
a
while
jack
eyes
were
so
busy
with
the
beauties
of
the
hudson
that
his
ears
heard
little
the
moonlight
was
very
bright
and
clear
and
showed
the
shores
plainly
jack
found
his
memory
of
the
guidebook
was
excellent
the
villages
and
towns
along
the
shores
were
so
many
collections
of
twinkling
changing
glimmers
and
between
them
lay
long
reaches
of
moonshine
and
shadow
i
like
to
write
home
about
it
thought
jack
but
i
could
begin
to
tell
how
it
looks
jack
was
not
sorry
when
the
three
ladies
said
he
had
never
before
been
so
long
upon
his
careful
good
behavior
in
one
evening
and
it
made
him
feel
constrained
till
he
almost
wished
he
was
back
in
crofield
guilderaufenberg
he
said
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
this
is
the
first
big

the

you
see
de

on
on
steamed
the
columbia
with
what
almost
seemed
a
slow
motion
it
was
so
ponderous
dignified
and
stately
while
the
moonlit
heights
and
hollows
rolled
by
on
either
hand
on
at
the
same
time
went
guilderaufenberg
with
his
stories
of
rivers
and
cities
and
countries
that
he
had
seen
and
of
battles
fought
along
rivers
and
across
them
then
suddenly
the
gruff
voice
grew
deep
and
savage
like
the
growl
of
an
angry
bear
and
he
exclaimed
i
haf
seen
some
men

of

guilderaufenberg
grew
and
began
to
laugh
what
kind
of
kings
asked
jack

there
was
a
long
silence
after
that
the
broad
german
sat
in
an
and
pretty
soon
he
slipped
forward
a
little
with
his
knees
very
near
the
network
below
the
rail
of
the
columbia
then
jack
heard
a
snore
and
knew
that
his
traveler
friend
was
sound
asleep
illustration
traveler
friend
was
sound
i
wish
i
had
a
chair
to
sleep
on
instead
of
this
campstool
thought
jack
i
have
a
look
all
around
the
boat
and
come
back
it
took
a
long
while
to
see
the
boat
and
the
first
thing
he
discovered
was
that
a
great
many
people
had
failed
to
secure
staterooms
or
berths
they
sat
in
chairs
and
they
lounged
on
sofas
and
they
were
curled
up
on
the
floor
for
the
columbia
had
received
a
flood
of
tourists
who
were
going
home
and
a
large
part
of
the
passengers
of
another
boat
that
had
been
detained
on
account
of
an
accident
at
albany
so
the
steamer
was
decidedly
overcrowded
there
are
more
people
aboard
thought
jack
than
would
make
two
such
villages
as
crofield
unless
you
should
count
in
the
farms
and
farmers
i
glad
i
came
if
it
only
to
know
what
a
steamboat
is
i
spent
a
cent
of
my
nine
dollars
yet
either
here
and
there
he
wandered
until
he
came
out
at
the
stern
and
had
a
look
at
the
foaming
wake
of
the
boat
and
at
the
river
and
the
heights
behind
and
at
the
grand
spectacle
of
another
great
steamboat
full
of
lights
on
her
way
up
the
river
he
had
seen
any
number
of
smaller
boats
and
of
sloops
and
schooners
and
now
along
the
eastern
bank
he
heard
and
saw
the
whizzing
rush
of
several
railway
trains
i
rather
be
here
he
thought
the
people
there
ca
see
half
so
much
as
i
can
not
one
of
them
moreover
had
been
traveling
all
over
the
world
with
guilderaufenberg
and
hearing
and
about
kings
and
their
police
getting
back
to
his
old
place
was
easier
now
that
he
began
to
understand
the
plan
of
the
columbia
but
when
jack
returned
his
was
gone
and
he
had
to
sit
down
on
the
bare
deck
or
to
stand
up
he
did
both
by
turns
and
he
was
beginning
to
feel
very
weary
of
and
to
wish
that
he
were
sound
asleep
or
that
had
come
it
a
warm
night
he
said
to
himself
and
it
is
so
very
dark
even
now
the
moon
has
gone
down
why
it
getting
lighter
is
it
morning
can
we
be
so
near
the
city
as
that
there
was
a
growing
upon
a
few
clouds
in
the
western
sky
as
the
sun
began
to
look
at
them
from
below
the
range
of
heights
eastward
but
the
sun
had
not
yet
risen
jack
was
all
but
breathless
he
walked
as
far
forward
as
he
could
go
and
forgot
all
about
being
sleepy
or
tired
there
he
said
after
a
little
those
must
be
the
palisades
out
came
his
and
he
tried
to
fit
names
to
the
places
along
shore
more
he
said
and
there
goes
another
train
we
must
be
almost
there
he
was
right
and
he
was
all
one
tingle
of
excitement
as
the
columbia
swept
steadily
on
down
the
widening
river
there
came
a
pressure
of
a
hand
upon
his
shoulder

and
now
jack
blood
tingled
more
sharply
to
his
very
fingers
and
toes
for
they
swept
beyond
spuyten
duyvil
creek
which
his
friend
pointed
out
and
the
city
began
to
make
its
appearance
it
on
both
sides
said
jack
no
that
new
jersey
and
he
read
the
names
on
that
side
from
his
guidebook
masts
wharves
buildings
and
beyond
them
spires
and
and
jack
grew
dizzy
trying
to
think
of
that
endless
wilderness
of
streets
and
houses
he
heard
what
guilderaufenberg
said
about
the
islands
in
the
harbor
the
forts
the
ferries
and
yet
he
did
not
hear
it
plainly
because
it
was
too
much
to
take
in
all
at
once
now
i

said
guilderaufenberg
an

ve

come
jack
took
one
long
sweeping
look
at
the
city
so
grand
and
so
beautiful
under
the
newly
risen
sun
and
followed
at
that
same
hour
a
girl
sat
by
an
open
window
in
the
village
of
mertonville
she
had
arisen
and
dressed
herself
early
as
it
was
and
she
held
in
her
hand
a
which
had
arrived
for
her
from
albany
the
night
before
by
this
time
she
said
jack
is
in
the
city
oh
how
i
wish
i
were
with
him
she
was
silent
after
that
but
she
had
hardly
said
it
before
one
of
two
small
boys
who
had
been
pounding
one
another
with
pillows
in
a
very
small
bedroom
in
crofield
suddenly
threw
his
pillow
at
the
other
and
exclaimed
i
jack
there
by
this
time
jimmy
chapter
xii
in
a
new
world
jack
ogden
stood
like
a
boy
in
a
dream
as
the
columbia
swept
gracefully
into
her
dock
and
was
made
fast
her
swing
about
was
helped
by
the
outgoing
tide
that
foamed
and
swirled
around
the
projecting
piers
a
hurrying
crowd
of
people
was
thronging
out
of
the
columbia
but
jack
german
friend
did
not
join
them
de
ceety
vill
not
roon
avay
he
said
calmly
you
comes
mit
me
they
went
to
the
cabin
for
the
ladies
and
jack
noticed
how
much
baggage
the
rest
were
carrying
he
took
a
satchel
from
miss
hildebrand
and
then
the
polish
lady
with
a
grateful
smile
allowed
him
to
take
another
dose
crowds
ees
gone
remarked
guilderaufenberg
ve
haf
our
chances
now
afterward
jack
had
a
confused
memory
of
walking
over
a
wide
that
led
into
a
babel
miss
hildebrand
held
him
by
his
left
arm
while
the
two
other
ladies
went
with
guilderaufenberg
they
came
out
into
a
street
between
two
files
of
men
who
shook
their
whips
shouted
and
pointed
at
a
line
of
carriages
miss
hildebrand
told
jack
that
they
could
reach
their
hotel
sooner
by
the
elevated
railway
he
look
pale
she
thought
considerately
he
did
not
sleep
all
night
he
never
before
travel
on
a
steamboat
jack
meanwhile
had
a
new
sensation
this
is
the
city
he
was
saying
to
himself
i
really
here
there
are
no
crowds
because
it
sunday
but
then
after
walking
a
few
minutes
they
came
to
a
corner
where
guilderaufenberg
turned
and
said
to
jack

a

it
was
indeed
a
wonderful
street
to
the
boy
from
crofield
and
he
felt
the
wonder
of
it
and
he
felt
the
wonder
of
the
sunday
quiet
and
of
the
closed
places
of
business
illustration
broadway
at
last
there
a
policeman
he
remarked
to
guilderaufenberg

the
german
smiling

i
believe
i
should
said
jack
politely
but
his
head
was
not
still
for
an
instant
his
eyes
and
his
thoughts
were
busily
at
work
he
had
expected
to
see
tall
and
splendid
buildings
and
had
even
dreamed
of
them
how
he
had
longed
and
hoped
and
planned
to
get
to
this
very
place
he
had
seen
pictures
of
the
city
but
the
reality
was
nevertheless
a
delightful
surprise
miss
hildebrand
pointed
out
trinity
church
and
afterward
paul
maybe
i
go
to
one
of
those
big
churches
said
jack
oh

miss
hildebrand

way
jack
replied
after
a
short
walk
they
came
to
city
hall
square
there
jack
exclaimed
i
know
this
place
it
just
like
the
pictures
in
my
there
the
the

guilderaufenberg

added
guilderaufenberg
there

said
jack
as
they
walked
along
sunday
or
no
sunday
of
course
said
miss
hildebrand
pointing
with
a
hand
that
lifted
a
small
satchel
that
the
elevated
railway
station
over
there
across
both
streets
there
too
is
where
you
go
to
the
suspension
bridge

the
east
river

said
jack
but
i
hungry
too
why
we
going
upstairs
in
a
minute
more
jack
was
sitting
by
an
open
window
of
an
elevated
railway
car
this
was
another
entirely
new
experience
and
jack
found
it
hard
to
rid
himself
of
the
notion
that
possibly
the
whole
railway
might
tumble
down
or
the
train
suddenly
shoot
off
from
the
track
and
drop
into
the
street

guilderaufenberg

jack
was
quite
ready
to
believe
guilderaufenberg
he
had
been
used
to
even
greater
quiet
in
crofield
for
after
all
there
seemed
to
be
a
great
deal
going
on
the
train
they
were
in
made
frequent
stops
and
it
did
not
seem
long
to
jack
before
guilderaufenberg
and
the
other
ladies
got
up
and
began
to
gather
their
parcels
and
satchels
jack
was
ready
when
his
friends
led
the
way
to
the
door
i
be
glad
to
get
off
he
thought
i
am
afraid
aunt
melinda
would
say
i
was
traveling
on
sunday
the
conductor
threw
open
the
car
door
and
shouted
and
guilderaufenberg
hurried
forward
exclaiming
come
dees
ees
our
station
jack
had
taken
even
more
than
his
share
of
the
luggage
and
now
his
arm
was
once
more
grasped
by
miss
hildebrand
i
take
good
care
of
her
he
said
to
himself
as
she
pushed
along
out
of
the
cars
all
i
need
to
do
is
to
follow
the
rest
he
did
not
understand
what
she
said
to
the
others
in
german
but
it
was
i
bring
ogden
he
will
know
how
to
look
out
for
himself
very
soon
she
meant
to
see
him
safely
to
the
hotel
dantzic
that
morning
and
the
next
thing
jack
knew
he
was
going
down
a
long
flight
of
stairs
to
the
sidewalk
while
miss
hildebrand
was
explaining
that
part
of
the
city
they
were
in
even
while
she
was
talking
and
while
he
was
looking
in
all
directions
she
wheeled
him
suddenly
to
the
left
and
they
came
to
a
halt
hotel
dantzic
read
jack
aloud
from
the
sign
it
a
tall
building
but
it
very
thin
the
ladies
went
into
the
while
jack
followed
guilderaufenberg
into
the
office
the
german
was
welcomed
by
the
proprietor
as
if
he
were
an
old
acquaintance
a
moment
afterward
guilderaufenberg
turned
away
from
the
desk
and
said
to
jack
my
poy

and
a

for
the
first

made
the
first
break
in
jack
capital
of
nine
dollars
any
way
he
thought
when
he
paid
it
i
have
found
a
place
to
sleep
in
money
go
fast
in
the
city
and
i
must
look

my
room
and
then

said
guilderaufenberg
kindly
den
you

us
more
maybe
till
you
comes
to
vashington
jack
got
his
key
and
the
number
of
his
room
and
was
making
his
way
to
the
foot
of
a
stairway
when
a
very
polite
man
said
to
him
this
way
sir
this
way
to
the
elevator
seventh
floor
sir
jack
had
heard
and
read
of
elevators
but
it
was
startling
to
ride
in
one
for
the
first
time
it
was
all
but
full
when
he
got
in
and
after
it
started
his
first
thought
was
how
it
loaded
what
if
the
rope
should
break
it
stopped
to
let
a
man
out
and
started
and
stopped
again
and
again
but
it
seemed
only
a
few
long
breathless
moments
before
the
man
in
charge
of
it
said
seventh
sir
the
moment
jack
was
in
his
room
he
exclaimed
is
this
grand
though
it
only
about
twice
as
big
as
that
stateroom
on
the
steamboat
i
can
feel
at
home
here
it
was
a
pleasant
little
room
and
jack
began
at
once
to
make
ready
for
breakfast
he
was
brushing
his
hair
when
he
went
to
the
window
and
as
he
looked
out
he
actually
dropped
the
brush
in
his
surprise
where
my
he
said
i
know
where
i
am
though
that
must
be
the
east
river
away
off
there
is
long
island
looks
as
if
it
was
all
city
maybe
that
is
brooklyn
i
do
know
is
this
a
high
house
i
can
look
down
on
all
the
other
roofs
jingo
he
hurried
through
his
toilet
meanwhile
taking
swift
glances
out
of
the
window
when
he
went
out
to
the
elevator
he
said
to
himself
i
go
down
by
the
stairs
some
day
just
to
see
how
it
seems
a
storm
would
whistle
like
anything
round
the
top
of
this
building
when
he
got
down
guilderaufenberg
was
waiting
for
him
and
the
party
of
ladies
went
in
to
breakfast
in
a
restaurant
which
occupied
nearly
all
of
the
lower
floor
of
the
hotel
i
understand
said
jack
in
reply
to
an
explanation
from
miss
hildebrand
you
pay
for
just
what
you
order
and
no
more
and
they
charge
high
for
everything
but
bread
i
beginning
to
learn
something
of
city
ways
during
all
that
morning
anybody
who
knew
jack
ogden
would
have
had
to
look
at
him
twice
he
had
been
so
quiet
and
sedate
but
the
old
look
gradually
returned
during
breakfast
ve
see
you
again
at
supper
said
guilderaufenberg
as
they
arose
den
ve
goes
to
vashington
you
valks

und
looks
about
you
easy
finds
your
vay
back
till
den
jack
shook
hands
with
his
friends
and
walked
out
into
the
street
well
here
i
am
he
thought
this
is
the
city
i
all
alone
in
it
too
and
i
must
find
my
own
way
i
can
do
it
though
i
glad
it
sunday
so
that
i
need
go
straight
to
work
at
that
moment
the
nine
bells
were
ringing
in
two
wooden
steeples
in
the
village
of
crofield
but
the
bell
of
the
third
steeple
was
silent
down
among
the
splinters
of
what
had
been
the
pulpit
of
its
own
the
village
was
very
still
but
there
was
something
peculiar
in
the
quiet
in
the
ogden
homestead
even
the
children
went
about
as
if
they
missed
something
or
were
listening
for
somebody
they
expected
there
were
nine
bells
also
in
mertonville
and
there
was
a
ring
at
the
of
the
house
of
murdoch
the
editor
why
elder
holloway
exclaimed
murdoch
when
she
opened
the
door
please
to
walk
in
thank
you
murdoch
but
i
ca
he
said
speaking
as
if

girls

our
sunday

of

murdoch

the
elder
just

her
it
a
nice
class
and
that
the
girls
expect
her
to
come
and
we
be
ever
go
much
obliged
to

and
he
was
gone
oh

exclaimed
mary
when
the
elder
message
was
given
i
ca
i
do
know
them
i
suppose
i
ought
but
i
have
said
no
if
i
had
seen
him
the
elder
had
thought
of
that
perhaps
and
had
provided
against
any
refusal
by
retreating
as
he
went
away
he
said
to
himself
she
can
do
it
i
know
if
she
does
it
help
me
carry
out
my
plan
he
looked
just
then
as
if
it
were
a
very
good
plan
but
he
did
not
reveal
it
mary
ogden
persuaded
murdoch
to
take
her
to
another
church
that
morning
so
that
she
need
not
meet
any
of
her
new
class
i
hope
jack
will
go
to
church
in
the
city
she
said
and
her
mother
said
the
same
thing
to
aunt
melinda
over
in
crofield
jack
could
not
have
given
any
reason
why
his
feet
turned
westward
but
he
went
slowly
along
for
several
blocks
while
he
stared
at
the
rows
of
buildings
at
the
sidewalks
at
the
pavements
and
at
everything
else
great
and
small
he
was
actually
leaving
the
world
in
which
he
had
been
brought
up
the
crofield
world
and
taking
a
first
stroll
around
in
a
world
of
quite
another
sort
he
met
some
people
on
the
streets
but
not
many
they
all
getting
ready
for
church
he
thought
and
his
next
thought
was
expressed
aloud
whew
what
street
this
i
wonder
he
had
passed
row
after
row
of
fine
buildings
but
suddenly
he
had
turned
into
a
wide
avenue
which
seemed
a
street
of
palaces
forward
he
went
faster
and
faster
staring
eagerly
at
one
after
another
of
those
elegant
mansions
of
stone
of
marble
or
of
brick
see
here
johnny
he
suddenly
heard
in
a
sharp
voice
close
to
him
what
number
do
you
want
hallo
said
jack
halting
and
turning
what
street
this
he
was
looking
up
into
the
face
of
a
tall
man
in
a
neat
blue
uniform
what
are
you
looking
for
began
the
policeman
again
but
without
waiting
for
jack
answer
he
went
on
oh
i
see
you
a
greeny
lookin
at
fifth
avenue
mind
where
you
going
or
you
run
into
somebody
is
this
fifth
avenue
jack
asked
i
wish
i
knew
who
owned
these
houses
you
do
do
you
laughed
the
man
in
blue
well
i
can
tell
you
some
of
them
that
house
belongs
to
and
the
policeman
went
on
giving
name
after
name
and
pointing
out
the
finest
houses
some
of
the
names
were
familiar
to
jack
he
had
read
about
these
men
in
newspapers
and
it
was
pleasant
to
see
where
they
lived
see
that
house
asked
the
policeman
pointing
at
one
of
the
finest
residences
well
the
man
that
owns
it
came
to
new
york
as
poor
as
you
maybe
poorer
not
quite
so
green
of
course
but
you
soon
get
over
that
see
that
big
house
yonder
on
the
corner
well
the
cash
for
that
was
gathered
by
a
chap
who
began
as
a
most
of
the
big
guns
came
up
from
nearly
nothing
now
you
walk
along
and
look
out
but
mind
you
do
run
over
anybody
much
obliged
said
jack
and
as
he
walked
on
he
kept
his
eyes
open
but
his
thoughts
were
busy
with
what
the
policeman
had
told
him
that
was
the
very
idea
he
had
while
he
was
in
crofield
that
was
what
had
made
him
long
to
break
away
from
the
village
and
find
his
way
to
the
city
his
imagination
had
busied
itself
with
stories
of
poor
boys
as
poor
and
green
as
he
scores
of
them
born
and
brought
up
in
country
homes
who
refusing
to
stay
at
home
and
be
nobodies
had
become
successful
men
all
the
great
buildings
he
saw
seemed
to
tell
the
same
story
still
he
did
say
to
himself
once
some
of
their
fathers
must
have
been
rich
enough
to
give
them
a
good
start
some
were
born
rich
too
i
do
care
for
that
though
i
do
know
as
i
want
so
big
a
house
i
am
going
to
get
along
somehow
my
chances
are
as
good
as
some
of
these
fellows
had
just
then
he
came
to
a
halt
for
right
ahead
of
him
were
open
grounds
and
beyond
were
grass
and
trees
to
the
right
and
left
were
buildings
i
know
what
this
is
exclaimed
jack
it
must
be
central
park
some
day
i
going
there
all
over
it
but
i
turn
around
now
and
find
a
place
to
go
to
church
i
passed
a
dozen
churches
on
the
way
chapter
xiii
a
wonderful
sunday
when
jack
turned
away
from
the
entrance
to
central
park
he
found
much
of
the
sunday
quiet
gone
it
was
nearly
ten
the
sidewalks
were
covered
with
people
and
the
street
resounded
with
the
rattle
of
there
was
some
uneasiness
in
the
mind
of
the
boy
from
crofield
the
policeman
had
impressed
upon
jack
the
idea
that
he
was
not
at
home
in
the
city
and
that
he
did
not
seem
at
home
there
he
did
not
know
one
church
from
another
and
part
of
his
uneasiness
was
about
how
city
people
managed
their
churches
perhaps
they
sold
tickets
he
thought
or
perhaps
you
paid
at
the
door
or
possibly
it
did
cost
anything
as
in
crofield
illustration
how
would
he
get
in
i
ask
he
decided
as
he
paused
in
front
of
what
seemed
to
him
a
very
imposing
church
he
stood
still
for
a
moment
as
the
steady
procession
passed
him
part
of
it
going
by
but
much
of
it
turning
into
the
church
mister
he
said
bashfully
to
four
men
in
quick
succession
but
not
one
of
them
paused
to
answer
him
two
did
not
so
much
as
look
at
him
and
the
glances
given
him
by
the
other
two
made
his
cheeks
burn
he
hardly
knew
why
there
a
man
i
try
thought
jack
i
getting
mad
the
man
of
whom
jack
spoke
came
up
the
street
he
seemed
an
unlikely
subject
he
was
so
straight
he
almost
leaned
backward
he
was
rather
slender
than
thin
and
was
uncommonly
well
dressed
in
fact
jack
said
to
himself
he
looks
as
if
he
had
bought
the
and
was
not
pleased
with
his
bargain
proud
even
haughty
as
was
the
manner
of
the
stranger
jack
stepped
boldly
forward
and
again
said
mister
well
my
boy
what
is
it
the
response
came
with
a
halt
and
almost
a
bow
if
a
fellow
wished
to
go
to
this
church
how
would
he
get
in
asked
jack
do
you
live
in
the
city
there
was
a
frown
of
stern
inquiry
on
the
broad
forehead
but
the
head
was
bending
farther
forward
no
said
jack
i
live
in
crofield
where
that
away
up
on
the
cocahutchie
river
i
came
here
early
this
morning
what
your
name
john
ogden
come
with
me
john
ogden
you
may
have
a
seat
in
my
pew
come
into
the
church
and
up
the
middle
aisle
jack
followed
his
leader
with
a
sense
of
awe
almost
stifling
him
then
too
he
felt
drowned
in
the
thunderous
flood
of
music
from
the
organ
he
saw
the
man
stop
open
a
step
back
smile
and
bow
and
then
wait
until
the
boy
from
crofield
had
passed
in
and
taken
his
seat
he
a
gentleman
thought
jack
hardly
aware
that
he
himself
had
bowed
low
as
he
went
in
and
that
a
smile
of
grim
approval
had
followed
him
in
the
pew
behind
them
sat
another
man
as
haughty
looking
but
just
now
wearing
the
same
kind
of
smile
as
he
leaned
forward
and
asked
in
an
audible
whisper
general
who
your
friend
john
ogden
of
crofield
away
up
on
the
cookyhutchie
river
i
netted
him
at
the
door
was
the
reply
in
the
same
tone
good
catch
asked
the
other
just
as
good
as
i
was
judge
forty
years
ago
i
tell
you
how
that
was
some
day
decidedly
raw
material
i
should
say
well
so
was
i
was
no
more
knowing
than
he
is
i
remember
what
it
is
to
be
far
away
from
home
the
hoarse
subdued
whispers
ceased
the
two
gentle
men
looked
grim
and
severe
again
then
there
was
a
grand
burst
of
music
from
the
organ
the
vast
congregation
stood
up
and
jack
rose
with
them
he
felt
solemn
enough
there
was
no
doubt
of
that
but
what
he
said
to
himself
unconsciously
took
this
shape
jingo
if
this
is
the
greatest
going
to
church
ever
did
hear
that
voice
the
organ
too
what
music
do
i
wish
molly
was
here
i
wish
all
the
family
were
here
the
service
went
on
and
jack
listened
attentively
in
spite
of
a
strong
tendency
in
his
eyes
to
wander
among
the
pillars
to
the
galleries
up
into
the
lofty
vault
above
him
or
around
among
the
pews
full
of
people
he
knew
it
was
a
good
sermon
and
that
the
music
was
good
singing
and
all
especially
when
the
congregation
joined
in
old
hundred
and
another
old
hymn
that
he
knew
still
he
had
an
increasing
sense
of
being
a
very
small
fellow
in
a
very
large
place
when
he
raised
his
head
after
the
benediction
he
saw
the
owner
of
the
pew
turn
toward
him
bow
low
and
hold
out
his
hand
jack
shook
hands
of
course
ogden
said
the
gentleman
gravely
with
almost
a
frown
on
his
face
but
very
politely
and
then
he
turned
and
walked
out
of
the
pew
jack
also
bowed
as
he
shook
hands
and
said
thank
you
sir
i
hope
you
enjoyed
the
sermon
general
said
the
gentleman
in
the
pew
behind
them
pretty
good
for
raw
material
keep
an
eye
on
him
no
i
wo
said
the
general
i
spoiled
four
or
five
in
that
very
way
well
i
believe
you
right
said
the
judge
after
a
moment
best
for
that
kind
of
boy
to
fight
his
own
battles
i
had
to
so
did
i
said
the
general
and
i
was
well
pounded
for
a
while
jack
did
not
hear
all
of
the
conversation
but
he
had
a
clear
idea
that
they
were
talking
about
him
and
as
he
walked
slowly
out
of
the
church
packed
in
among
the
crowd
in
the
aisle
he
had
a
very
rosy
face
indeed
jack
had
in
mind
a
thought
that
had
often
come
to
him
in
the
church
at
crofield
near
the
end
of
the
sermon
he
was
conscious
that
it
was
of
course
he
thought
with
a
little
homesickness
of
the
home
i
wish
i
could
sit
right
down
with
them
he
thought
and
tell
them
what
sunday
is
in
the
city
then
my
dinner
would
cost
me
a
cent
there
either
no
matter
i
here
and
now
i
can
begin
to
make
more
money
right
away
i
have
five
dollars
and
fifty
cents
left
anyway
then
he
thought
of
the
bill
of
fare
at
the
hotel
dantzic
and
many
of
the
prices
on
it
and
remembered
guilderaufenberg
instructions
about
going
to
some
cheaper
place
for
his
meals
i
did
tell
him
that
i
had
only
nine
dollars
he
said
to
himself
but
i
follow
his
advice
he
a
traveler
jack
had
been
too
proud
to
explain
how
little
money
he
had
but
his
german
friend
had
really
done
well
by
him
in
making
him
take
the
little
room
at
the
top
of
the
hotel
dantzic
he
had
said
to
his
wife
dot
poy
vell
i
see
him
again
some
day
he
got
a
place
to
shleep
anyhow
vile
he
looks
around
und
see
de
ceety
no
oder
poy
i
efer
meets
know
at
de
same
time
so
moch
and
so
leetle
with
every
step
from
the
church
door
jack
felt
hungrier
but
he
did
not
turn
his
steps
toward
the
hotel
dantzic
he
walked
on
down
to
the
lower
part
of
the
city
on
the
lookout
for
hotels
and
restaurants
it
was
not
long
before
he
came
to
a
hotel
and
then
he
passed
another
and
another
and
he
passed
a
number
of
places
where
the
signs
told
him
of
dinners
to
be
had
within
but
all
looked
too
fine
they
for
rich
people
he
said
shaking
his
head
like
the
people
in
that
church
what
stacks
of
money
they
must
have
that
organ
maybe
cost
more
than
all
the
in
crofield
after
going
a
little
farther
jack
exclaimed
i
do
care
i
just
got
to
eat
he
was
getting
farther
and
farther
from
the
hotel
dantzic
and
suddenly
his
eyes
were
caught
by
a
very
taking
sign
at
the
top
of
some
neat
steps
leading
down
into
a
basement
dinner
roast
beef
cents
that
do
said
jack
eagerly
i
can
stand
that
roost
beef
alone
is
forty
cents
at
the
dantzic
down
he
went
and
found
himself
in
a
wide
comfortable
room
containing
two
long
dining
tables
and
a
number
of
small
oblong
tables
and
some
round
tables
all
as
neat
as
wax
it
was
a
very
pleasant
place
and
a
great
many
other
hungry
people
were
there
already
jack
sat
down
at
one
of
the
small
tables
and
a
waiter
came
to
him
at
once
dinner
sir
yessir
roast
beef
sir
yessir
vegetables
potatoes
sweet
corn
yes
please
said
jack
beef
potatoes
beans
and
corn
and
the
waiter
was
gone
it
seemed
to
be
a
long
time
before
the
beef
and
vegetables
came
but
they
were
not
long
in
disappearing
after
they
were
on
the
table
the
waiter
had
other
people
to
serve
but
he
was
an
attentive
fellow
pie
sir
he
said
naming
five
kinds
without
a
pause
said
jack
coffee
sir
yessir
and
he
darted
away
again
this
beats
the
hotel
dantzic
all
to
pieces
remarked
jack
as
he
went
on
with
his
pie
and
coffee
but
the
waiter
was
scribbling
something
upon
a
slip
of
paper
and
when
it
was
done
he
put
it
down
by
plate
jingo
said
jack
in
a
horrified
tone
a
moment
later
what
this
beef
potatoes
corn
bread
coffee
pie
eighty
cents
jingo
how
like
smoke
it
does
cost
to
live
in
new
york
this
ca
be
one
of
the
cheap
places
guilderaufenberg
meant
jack
felt
much
chagrined
but
he
finished
his
pie
and
coffee
bravely
it
a
sell
he
said
but
then
it
a
good
dinner
he
went
to
the
cashier
with
an
effort
to
act
as
if
it
was
an
old
story
to
him
he
gave
the
cashier
a
dollar
received
his
change
and
turned
away
as
the
man
behind
the
counter
remarked
to
a
friend
at
his
elbow
i
knew
it
he
had
the
cash
his
face
was
all
right
clothes
will
fool
anybody
said
the
other
man
jack
heard
it
and
he
looked
at
the
men
sitting
at
the
tables
they
all
wearing
sunday
clothes
he
thought
but
some
are
no
better
than
mine
but
there
a
difference
i
noticed
it
all
along
so
had
others
for
jack
had
not
seen
one
in
that
restaurant
who
had
on
at
all
such
a
suit
of
clothes
as
had
been
made
for
him
by
the
crofield
tailor
four
dollars
and
seventy
cents
left
said
jack
thoughtfully
as
he
went
up
into
the
street
and
then
he
turned
to
go
without
any
reason
for
choosing
that
direction
an
hour
later
gilderaufenberg
and
his
wife
and
their
friends
were
standing
near
the
front
door
of
the
hotel
dantzic
talking
with
the
proprietor
around
them
lay
their
baggage
and
in
front
of
the
door
was
a
carriage
evidently
they
were
going
away
earlier
than
they
had
intended
dot
poy
exclaimed
the
broad
and
bearded
german
he
find
us
not
here
ven
he
come
you
pe
goot
to
dot
poy
mr
keifelheimer
so
said
the
hotel
proprietor
and
at
once
three
other
voices
chimed
in
with
messages
to
jack
ogden
keifelheimer
responded
i
see
to
him
he
will
come
to
vashington
to
see
you
so
then
they
entered
the
carriage
and
away
they
went
after
walking
for
a
few
blocks
jack
found
that
he
did
not
know
exactly
where
he
was
but
suddenly
he
exclaimed
why
if
there
is
city
hall
square
i
come
all
the
way
down
broadway
he
had
stared
at
building
after
building
for
a
time
without
thinking
much
about
them
and
then
he
had
begun
to
read
the
signs
i
come
down
this
way
again
he
said
it
good
there
are
so
many
places
to
work
in
i
wish
i
knew
exactly
what
i
would
like
to
do
and
which
of
them
it
is
best
to
go
to
i
know
i
can
do
as
i
did
in
crofield
i
can
try
one
for
a
while
and
then
if
i
do
like
it
i
can
try
another
it
is
lucky
that
i
know
how
to
do
anything
the
confident
smile
had
come
back
he
had
entirely
recovered
from
the
shock
of
his
expenditure
he
had
not
met
many
people
all
the
way
down
and
the
stores
were
shut
but
for
that
very
reason
he
had
bad
more
time
to
study
the
signs
very
nearly
every
kind
of
business
is
done
on
broadway
he
said
except
groceries
and
hardware
but
they
sell
more
clothing
than
anything
else
i
look
round
everywhere
before
i
settle
down
but
i
must
look
out
not
to
spend
too
much
money
till
i
begin
to
make
some
it
not
far
now
he
said
a
little
while
after
to
the
lower
end
of
the
city
and
to
the
battery
i
take
a
look
at
the
battery
before
i
go
back
to
the
hotel
dantzic
taller
and
more
majestic
grew
the
buildings
as
he
went
on
but
he
was
not
now
so
dazed
and
confused
as
he
had
been
in
the
morning
here
is
trinity
church
again
he
said
i
remember
about
that
and
that
wall
street
i
see
that
as
i
come
back
but
now
i
go
right
along
and
see
the
battery
of
course
there
is
any
battery
there
but
guilderaufenberg
said
that
from
it
i
could
see
the
fort
on
governor
island
jack
did
not
see
much
of
the
battery
for
he
followed
the
sidewalk
at
the
bowling
green
where
broadway
turns
into
whitehall
street
he
had
so
long
been
staring
at
great
buildings
whose
very
height
made
him
dizzy
that
he
was
glad
to
see
beside
them
some
which
looked
small
and
old
i
find
my
way
without
asking
he
remarked
to
himself
i
pretty
near
the
end
now
there
are
some
gates
and
one
of
them
is
open
walk
right
in
behind
that
carriage
that
must
be
the
gate
to
the
battery
the
place
he
was
really
looking
for
was
at
some
distance
to
the
right
and
the
carriage
he
was
following
so
confidently
had
a
very
different
destination
the
wide
gateway
was
guarded
by
watchful
men
not
to
mention
two
policemen
and
they
would
have
caught
and
stopped
any
boy
who
had
knowingly
tried
to
do
what
jack
did
so
innocently
their
backs
must
have
been
turned
for
the
carriage
passed
in
and
so
did
jack
without
any
one
trying
to
stop
him
he
was
as
bold
as
a
lion
about
it
because
he
did
not
know
any
better
a
number
of
people
were
at
the
same
time
crowding
through
a
narrower
gateway
at
one
side
and
they
may
have
distracted
the
attention
of
the
gatemen
i
just
as
lief
go
in
at
the
said
jack
and
he
did
not
notice
that
each
one
stopped
and
paid
something
before
going
through
jack
went
on
behind
the
carriage
the
carriage
crossed
what
seemed
to
jack
a
kind
of
bridge
housed
over
nobody
but
a
boy
straight
from
crofield
could
have
gone
so
far
as
that
without
suspecting
something
but
the
carriage
stopped
behind
a
line
of
other
vehicles
and
jack
walked
unconcernedly
past
them
jingo
he
suddenly
exclaimed
what
this
i
do
believe
the
end
of
this
street
is
moving
he
bounded
forward
much
startled
by
a
thing
so
strange
and
unaccountable
and
in
a
moment
more
he
was
looking
out
upon
a
great
expanse
of
water
dotted
here
and
there
with
ships
and
steamers
mister
he
asked
excitedly
of
a
little
man
leaning
against
a
post
what
this
have
ye
missed
your
way
and
got
onto
the
wrong
replied
the
little
man
gleefully
i
did
it
once
myself
all
right
my
boy
you
got
to
go
to
staten
island
this
time
take
it
coolly
said
jack
staten
island
i
thought
it
was
the
end
of
the
street
going
into
the
battery
oh
you
a
greenhorn
laughed
the
little
man
well
it
wo
hurt
ye
only
there
no
boat
back
from
the
island
on
sunday
till
after
supper
i
tell
ye
all
about
it
where
you
come
from
from
crofield
said
jack
and
i
got
here
only
this
morning
the
little
man
eyed
him
for
a
moment
and
then
led
him
to
the
rail
of
the
boat
look
back
there
he
said
yonder
the
battery
you
ought
to
have
kept
on
it
too
much
for
me
how
you
ever
got
aboard
of
this
boat
without
knowing
it
and
he
went
on
with
a
long
string
of
explanations
of
which
jack
understood
about
half
with
the
help
of
what
he
recalled
from
his
all
the
while
however
they
were
having
a
sail
across
the
beautiful
bay
and
little
by
little
jack
made
up
his
mind
not
to
care
i
made
a
mistake
and
slipped
right
out
of
the
city
he
said
to
himself
about
as
soon
as
i
got
in
but
maybe
i
can
slip
back
again
this
evening
about
the
greenest
bumpkin
i
seen
for
an
age
thought
the
little
man
as
he
stood
and
looked
at
jack
it
take
all
sorts
of
blunders
to
teach
him
he
is
younger
than
he
looks
too
anyway
this
sail
wo
hurt
him
a
bit
that
was
precisely
jack
conclusion
long
before
the
swift
voyage
ended
and
he
walked
off
the
upon
the
solid
ground
of
staten
island
chapter
xiv
friends
and
enemies
when
jack
ogden
left
the
staten
island
he
felt
somewhat
as
if
he
had
made
an
unexpected
voyage
to
china
and
perhaps
might
never
return
to
his
own
country
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
and
he
had
been
told
by
the
little
man
that
the
would
wait
an
hour
and
a
half
before
the
return
voyage
i
wo
lose
sight
of
her
said
jack
thoughtfully
no
running
around
for
me
this
time
he
did
not
move
about
at
all
he
sat
upon
an
old
box
in
front
of
a
closed
grocery
store
near
the
deciding
to
watch
and
wait
until
the
boat
started
dullest
time
i
ever
had
he
thought
and
it
will
cost
me
six
cents
to
get
back
you
have
to
pay
something
everywhere
you
go
i
wish
that
boat
was
ready
to
go
now
it
was
not
ready
and
it
seemed
as
if
it
never
would
be
meanwhile
the
crofield
boy
sat
there
on
the
box
and
studied
the
business
he
had
learned
something
of
it
from
his
but
he
understood
it
all
before
the
gates
opened
he
had
not
learned
much
concerning
any
part
of
staten
island
beyond
what
he
already
knew
from
the
map
but
shortly
after
he
had
paid
his
fare
he
began
to
learn
something
about
the
bay
and
the
lower
end
of
new
york
i
glad
to
be
on
board
again
he
said
as
he
walked
through
the
long
cabin
to
the
open
deck
forward
in
a
few
minutes
more
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
exclaimed
she
starting
i
know
i
on
the
right
boat
too
but
i
hungry
and
i
wish
i
had
something
to
eat
there
was
nothing
to
be
had
on
board
the
boat
but
although
hungry
jack
could
see
enough
to
keep
him
from
thinking
about
it
it
all
city
and
all
wharves
and
houses
and
steeples
every
way
you
look
he
said
i
glad
to
have
seen
it
from
the
outside
after
all
jack
stared
but
did
not
say
a
word
to
anybody
until
the
ran
into
its
dock
if
i
only
had
a
piece
of
pie
and
a
cup
of
coffee
jack
was
thinking
as
he
walked
along
by
the
wharves
ashore
then
he
caught
sight
of
the
smallest
restaurant
he
had
ever
seen
it
was
a
with
an
awning
over
it
standing
on
a
corner
a
placard
hanging
from
the
awning
read
clams
one
cent
apiece
coffee
five
cents
a
cup
that
plain
enough
exclaimed
jack
she
ca
put
on
a
cent
more
for
anything
a
stout
woman
stood
behind
a
kind
of
table
at
the
end
of
the
cart
and
on
the
table
there
were
bottles
of
vinegar
and
some
crackers
and
a
big
tin
illustration
and
clams
she
repeated
on
the
shell
coffee
all
right
that
all
i
want
thank
you
said
jack
and
she
at
once
filled
a
cup
from
the
and
began
to
open
shellfish
for
him
these
are
the
smallest
clams
i
ever
saw
thought
jack
but
good
they
seemed
better
and
better
as
he
went
on
eating
and
the
woman
willingly
supplied
them
he
drank
his
coffee
and
ate
crackers
freely
and
he
was
just
thinking
that
it
was
time
for
him
to
stop
when
the
woman
remarked
with
an
air
of
pride
nice
and
fresh
ai
they
you
seem
to
like
them
thirteen
a
dozen
seventeen
cents
have
i
swallowed
a
dozen
already
said
jack
looking
at
the
pile
of
shells
yes
they
tiptop
after
paying
for
his
supper
there
were
only
some
coppers
left
besides
four
bills
in
his
which
way
the
battery
jack
asked
as
she
began
to
open
clams
for
another
customer
back
there
a
way
keep
straight
on
till
you
see
it
she
answered
adding
kindly
it
like
a
little
park
i
did
know
you
were
from
the
country
pretty
good
supper
after
all
he
said
cheap
too
but
my
leaking
away
well
it
is
dark
yet
i
must
see
all
i
can
before
i
go
to
the
hotel
he
followed
the
woman
directions
and
he
was
glad
he
had
done
so
he
had
studied
his
faithfully
as
to
all
that
end
of
new
york
and
in
spite
of
his
recent
blunder
did
not
now
need
to
ask
anybody
which
was
the
starting
place
of
the
elevated
railways
and
which
was
castle
garden
where
the
immigrants
were
landed
there
were
little
groups
of
these
foreigners
scattered
over
the
great
open
space
before
him
they
come
from
all
over
the
world
he
said
looking
at
group
after
group
some
of
those
men
will
have
a
harder
time
than
i
have
had
trying
to
get
started
in
new
york
it
occurred
to
him
nevertheless
that
he
was
a
long
way
from
crofield
and
that
he
was
not
yet
at
all
at
home
in
the
city
i
know
some
things
that
they
do
know
anyway
if
i
green
he
was
thinking
i
cut
across
and
take
a
nearer
look
at
castle
garden
stop
there
stop
you
fellow
in
the
light
hat
hold
on
jack
heard
some
one
cry
out
as
he
started
to
cross
the
turfed
inclosures
what
do
you
want
of
me
jack
asked
as
he
turned
around
do
you
see
the
sign
there
off
the
grass
look
you
on
the
grass
now
come
off
anyway
i
fine
you
fifty
cents
jack
looked
as
the
man
pointed
and
saw
a
little
board
on
a
short
post
and
there
was
the
sign
in
plain
letters
and
here
before
him
was
a
tall
thin
young
man
looking
him
fiercely
in
the
face
and
holding
out
his
hand
fifty
cents
quick
now
or
go
with
me
to
the
police
station
jack
was
a
little
bewildered
for
a
moment
he
felt
like
a
cat
in
a
very
strange
garret
his
first
thought
of
the
police
made
him
remember
part
of
what
guilderaufenberg
had
told
him
about
keeping
away
from
them
but
he
remembered
only
the
wrong
part
and
his
hand
went
unwillingly
into
his
pocket
right
off
now
no
skulking
exclaimed
the
sharp
eyed
man
i
have
fifty
cents
in
change
said
jack
dolefully
taking
a
dollar
bill
from
his
hand
me
that
then
i
go
and
get
it
changed
and
the
man
reached
out
a
hand
and
took
the
bill
from
jack
fingers
without
waiting
for
his
consent
i
be
right
back
you
stand
right
there
where
you
are
till
i
come
hold
on
shouted
jack
i
did
say
you
could
give
me
back
that
bill
you
wait
i
bring
your
change
as
soon
as
i
can
get
it
called
the
man
as
he
darted
away
but
jack
hesitation
was
over
in
about
ten
seconds
i
follow
him
anyhow
he
exclaimed
and
he
did
so
at
a
run
halt
it
was
a
man
in
a
neat
gray
uniform
and
gilt
buttons
who
spoke
this
time
and
jack
halted
just
as
the
fleeing
man
vanished
into
a
crowd
on
one
of
the
broad
walks
he
got
my
dollar
tell
me
what
it
is
quick
said
the
policeman
with
a
sudden
expression
of
interest
jack
almost
spluttered
as
he
related
how
the
fellow
had
collected
the
fine
but
the
man
in
gray
only
shook
his
head
i
thought
i
saw
him
putting
up
something
he
said
it
well
he
did
get
your
too
he
wo
show
himself
here
again
he
safe
by
this
time
do
you
know
him
asked
jack
greatly
excited
but
more
than
a
little
in
dread
of
the
buttons
and
club
know
him
the
sneak
of
course
i
do
he
only
about
two
weeks
out
of
sing
sing
it
wo
be
long
before
he
back
there
again
when
did
you
come
to
town
what
your
name
where
you
come
from
where
are
you
staying
do
you
know
anybody
in
town
he
had
a
pencil
and
a
little
and
he
rapidly
wrote
out
jack
answers
you
get
your
eyes
open
pretty
fast
at
this
rate
he
said
that
all
i
want
of
you
now
if
i
lay
a
hand
on
jimmy
i
know
where
to
find
you
you
better
go
home
if
any
other
thief
asks
you
for
fifty
cents
you
call
for
the
nearest
policeman
that
what
here
for
a
whole
dollar
gone
and
nothing
to
show
for
it
groaned
jack
as
he
walked
away
only
three
dollars
and
a
few
cents
left
i
walk
all
the
way
up
to
the
hotel
dantzic
instead
of
paying
five
cents
for
a
car
ride
i
have
to
save
money
now
he
felt
more
kindly
toward
all
the
policemen
he
met
and
he
was
glad
there
were
so
many
of
them
the
police
at
central
park
he
remarked
to
himself
and
that
fellow
at
the
battery
were
all
in
gray
and
the
street
police
wear
blue
but
they
a
set
of
men
i
hope
they
will
nab
jimmy
the
sneak
and
get
back
my
dollar
for
me
the
farther
he
went
however
the
clearer
became
his
conviction
that
dollars
paid
to
thieves
seldom
come
back
and
that
an
evening
walk
of
more
than
three
miles
over
the
stone
sidewalks
of
new
york
is
a
long
stroll
for
a
very
tired
and
somewhat
homesick
country
boy
he
cared
less
and
less
all
the
way
how
strangely
and
how
splendidly
the
and
the
electric
lights
lit
up
the
tall
buildings
one
light
white
he
said
and
the
other
yellowish
and
about
all
there
is
of
it
well
i
not
quite
so
green
for
i
know
more
than
i
did
this
morning
it
was
late
for
him
when
he
reached
the
hotel
but
it
seemed
to
be
early
enough
for
everybody
else
many
people
were
coming
and
going
and
among
them
all
he
did
not
see
a
face
that
he
knew
or
cared
for
the
homesick
feeling
grew
upon
him
and
he
walked
very
dolefully
to
the
elevator
up
it
went
in
a
minute
and
when
he
reached
his
room
he
threw
his
hat
upon
the
table
and
sat
down
to
think
over
the
long
and
eventful
day
illustration
is
this
is
the
toughest
day
work
i
ever
did
i
like
to
see
the
folks
in
crofield
and
tell
about
it
though
he
said
he
went
to
bed
intending
to
consider
his
plans
for
monday
but
he
made
one
mistake
he
happened
to
close
his
eyes
the
next
thing
he
knew
there
was
a
ray
of
warm
sunshine
striking
his
face
from
the
open
window
for
he
had
slept
soundly
and
it
was
nearly
seven
on
monday
morning
jack
looked
around
his
room
and
then
sprang
out
of

thing
and
then
i

and
go
to

he
felt
better
all
the
hopes
he
had
cherished
so
long
began
to
stir
within
him
he
brushed
his
clothes
thoroughly
and
put
on
his
best
necktie
and
then
he
walked
out
of
that
room
with
hardly
a
doubt
that
all
the
business
in
the
great
city
was
ready
and
waiting
for
him
to
come
and
take
part
in
it
he
went
down
the
elevator
after
a
glance
at
the
stairway
and
a
shake
of
his
head
stairs
are
too
slow
he
thought
i
try
them
some
time
when
i
am
not
so
busy
as
he
stepped
out
upon
the
lower
floor
he
met
keifelheimer
the
proprietor

said

jack
was
very
glad
to
hear
of
his
friends
what
had
become
of
them
and
what
they
had
said
about
him
and
of
course
he
was
quite
ready
for
breakfast
keifelheimer
talked
while
they
were
eating
in
the
most
friendly
and
protecting
way
jack
felt
that
he
could
speak
freely
and
so
he
told
the
whole
story
of
his
adventures
on
sunday
staten
island
jimmy
the
sneak
and
all
keifelheimer
listened
with
deep
interest
making
appreciative
remarks
every
now
and
then
but
he
seemed
to
be
most
deeply
touched
by
the
account
of
the
dinner

mit
me
jack
could
but
admit
that
the
hotel
dantzic
price
was
lower
than
the
other
but
he
paid
it
with
an
uneasy
feeling
that
while
he
must
have
misunderstood
keifelheimer
invitation
it
was
impossible
to
say
so
get
dose
letter
said
the
kindly
and
thoughtful
proprietor

room
jack
thanked
him
and
went
for
his
mail
full
of
wonder
as
to
how
any
letters
could
have
come
to
him
a
whole
handful
he
said
in
yet
greater
wonder
when
the
clerk
handed
them
out
who
could
have
known
i
was
here
nine
ten
eleven
twelve
a
dozen
one
after
another
jack
found
the
envelops
full
of
nicely
printed
cards
and
circulars
telling
him
how
and
where
to
find
different
kinds
of
goods
that
makes
eight
he
said
and
every
one
a
sell
but
jingo
it
was
a
blue
envelope
and
when
he
opened
it
his
fingers
came
upon
a
dollar
bill
guilderaufenberg
a
trump
he
exclaimed
and
he
added
gratefully
i
only
about
two
dollars
and
a
half
left
he
only
written
three
lines
they
were
kindly
words
however
ending
with
i
have
not
tell
the
ladies
but

be

for
the
stateroom
i
hope

a
good
time
von
guilderaufenberg
the
next
envelope
was
white
and
square
and
when
it
came
open
jack
found
another
dollar
bill
she
a
real
good
woman
he
said
when
he
read
his
name
and
these
words
i
say
nothing
to
anybody
but
you
should
have
pay
for
your
stateroom
you
was
so
kind

haste
gertrude
von
guilderaufenberg

day
said
jack
he
had
opened
the
eleventh
envelope
which
was
square
and
pink
and
out
came
another
dollar
bill
jack
read
his
own
name
again
followed
by
we

this
minute
i
have
not
told
them

should
have

for
your

so
kind
marie
hildebrand
now
if
she
is
one
of
the
most
thoughtful
women
in
the
world
said
jack
and
what
this
square
gray
with
an
ornamental
seal
was
the
twelfth
envelope
and
out
of
it
came
a
fourth
dollar
bill
and
this
note
for
the
stateroom
i
have
told
not
the
others
with
thanks
of
doliska
pod
ski
it
was
a
fine
small
pointed
and
wandering
handwriting
and
jack
in
vain
strove
to
make
out
the
letters
in
the
middle
of
the
polish
name
i
do
care
he
said
she
kind
too
so
are
all
the
rest
of
them
and
guilderaufenberg
one
of
the
best
fellows
i
ever
met
now
i
got
over
six
dollars
and
i
can
make
some
more
right
away
he
pocketed
his
money
and
felt
more
confident
than
ever
and
he
walked
out
of
the
hotel
dantzic
just
as
his
father
at
home
in
crofield
was
reading
to
ogden
and
aunt
melinda
and
the
children
the
letter
he
had
written
in
albany
on
saturday
they
all
had
their
comments
to
make
but
at
the
end
of
it
the
tall
blacksmith
said
to
his
wife
there
one
thing
certain
mary
i
wo
let
go
of
any
of
that
land
till
after
they
run
the
railway
through
it
land
said
aunt
melinda
why
it
nothing
but
gravel
they
do
anything
with
it
it
joins
mine
said
ogden
and
i
own
more
than
an
acre
behind
the
shop
we
see
whether
the
railroad
will
make
any
difference
well
the
boy
reached
the
city
long
before
this
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
after
that
and
then
ogden
went
over
to
the
shop
he
was
not
very
cheerful
for
he
began
to
feel
that
jack
was
really
gone
from
home
in
mertonville
mary
ogden
was
helping
murdoch
in
her
housework
and
seemed
to
be
disposed
to
look
out
of
the
window
rather
than
to
talk
now
mary
said
the
editor
wife
you
need
look
so
peaked
and
feel
so
blue
about
the
way
you
got
along
with
that
class
of
girls
girls
said
mary
why
murdoch
only
half
of
them
were
younger
than
i
they
said
there
would
be
only
sixteen
and
there
were
some
of
the
scholars
were
twice
as
old
as
i
am
and
one
had
gray
hair
and
wore
spectacles
i
do
care
said
murdoch
the
elder
said
you
did
well
now
dear
dress
yourself
and
be
ready
for
edwards
she
coming
after
you
and
i
hope
you
enjoy
your
visit
come
in
and
see
me
as
often
as
you
can
and
tell
me
the
news
mary
finished
the
dishes
and
went
upstairs
saying
and
they
want
me
to
take
that
class
again
next
sunday
chapter
xv
no
boy
wanted
after
leaving
the
hotel
dantzic
with
his
unexpected
supply
of
money
jack
walked
smilingly
down
toward
the
business
part
of
the
city
for
a
while
he
only
studied
signs
and
looked
into
great
and
he
became
more
and
more
confident
as
he
thought
how
many
different
ways
there
were
for
a
really
smart
boy
to
make
a
fortune
in
new
york
he
decided
to
try
one
way
at
just
about
nine
the
city
a
busy
place
thought
jack
as
he
walked
along
some
difference
between
the
way
they
rush
along
on
monday
and
the
way
they
loitered
all
day
sunday
he
even
walked
faster
because
the
stream
of
men
carried
him
along
it
made
him
think
of
the
cocahutchie
i
try
one
of
these
big
clothing
places
he
said
about
nine
i
see
what
wages
they
giving
i
know
something
about
tailoring
he
paused
in
front
of
a
wide
and
store
on
broadway
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
went
in
the
moment
he
entered
he
was
confronted
by
a
very
fat
smiling
gentleman
who
bowed
and
asked
what
can
we
do
for
you
sir
i
like
to
know
if
you
want
a
boy
said
jack
and
what
wages
giving
i
know
after
a
place
oh
yes
that
the
man
you
ought
to
see
said
the
jocose
pointing
to
a
spruce
salesman
behind
a
counter
and
winking
at
him
from
behind
jack
the
business
of
the
day
had
hardly
begun
and
the
idle
salesman
saw
the
wink
jack
walked
up
to
him
and
repeated
his
inquiry
want
a
place
eh
where
are
you
from
been
long
in
the
business
jack
told
him
about
crofield
and
about
the
merchant
tailors
there
and
gave
a
number
of
particulars
before
the
very
dignified
and
salesman
love
of
fun
was
satisfied
and
then
the
salesman
said
i
ca
say
you
better
talk
with
that
man
yonder
there
was
another
wink
and
jack
went
to
that
man
to
answer
another
string
of
questions
some
of
which
related
to
his
family
and
the
he
attended
and
then
he
was
sent
on
to
another
man
and
another
and
to
as
many
more
until
at
last
he
heard
a
gruff
voice
behind
him
asking
what
does
that
fellow
want
send
him
to
me
jack
turned
toward
the
voice
and
saw
a
glass
coop
as
he
called
it
all
glass
panes
up
to
above
his
head
excepting
one
wide
semicircular
opening
in
the
middle
the
clerk
to
whom
jack
was
talking
at
that
moment
suddenly
became
very
sober
head
of
the
house
he
exclaimed
to
himself
whew
i
did
know
he
come
then
he
said
to
jack
the
head
partner
is
at
the
cashier
desk
speak
to
him
jack
stepped
forward
his
cheeks
burning
with
the
sudden
perception
that
he
had
been
ridiculed
he
saw
a
lady
counting
money
just
inside
the
little
window
but
she
moved
away
and
jack
was
confronted
by
a
very
stern
gentleman
what
do
you
want
the
man
asked
i
like
to
know
if
you
hire
another
boy
and
what
you
paying
said
jack
bravely
no
i
do
want
any
boy
replied
the
man
in
the
coop
savagely
you
get
right
out
tell
you
what
you
want
said
jack
for
his
temper
was
rising
fast
you
better
get
a
politer
set
of
clerks
i
will
if
there
is
any
more
of
this
nonsense
said
the
head
of
the
house
sharply
now
that
enough
no
more
impertinence
jack
was
all
but
choking
with
mortification
and
he
wheeled
and
marched
out
of
the
store
i
was
afraid
of
him
he
thought
and
i
ought
to
have
spoken
to
him
first
thing
i
might
have
known
better
than
to
have
asked
those
fellows
i
be
green
enough
to
do
that
again
i
ask
the
head
man
next
time
that
was
what
he
tried
to
do
in
six
one
after
another
but
in
each
case
he
made
a
failure
in
two
of
them
they
said
the
managing
partner
was
out
and
then
when
he
tried
to
find
out
whether
they
wanted
a
boy
the
man
he
asked
became
angry
and
showed
him
the
door
in
three
more
he
was
at
first
treated
politely
and
then
informed
that
they
already
had
hundreds
of
applications
to
enter
the
sixth
store
was
an
effort
but
he
went
in
one
of
the
firm
yes
sir
said
the
there
he
is
only
a
few
feet
from
him
stood
a
man
so
like
the
one
whose
face
had
glowered
at
him
through
that
cashier
window
in
the
first
store
that
jack
hesitated
a
moment
but
the
clerk
spoke
out
wishes
to
speak
to
you
mr
hubbard
this
way
my
boy
what
is
it
jack
was
surprised
by
the
full
mellow
benevolent
voice
that
came
from
under
the
white
moustaches
do
you
want
to
hire
a
boy
sir
he
inquired
i
do
not
my
son
where
are
you
from
asked
hubbard
with
a
kindlier
expression
than
before
jack
told
him
and
answered
two
or
three
other
questions
from
up
in
the
country
eh
he
said
have
you
money
enough
to
get
home
again
i
could
get
home
stammered
jack
but
there
is
any
chance
for
a
boy
up
in
crofield
ten
chances
there
for
every
one
there
is
in
the
city
my
boy
said
hubbard
one
hundred
boys
here
for
every
place
that
vacant
you
go
home
dig
potatoes
make
hay
drive
cows
feed
pigs
do
honest
but
get
out
of
new
york
it
one
great
now
with
men
and
boys
who
ca
find
anything
to
do
thank
you
sir
said
jack
with
a
tightening
around
his
heart
but
i
find
something
you
see
if
i
do
take
my
advice
and
go
home
replied
hubbard
kindly
said
jack
and
while
going
out
of
that
store
he
had
the
vividest
recollections
of
all
the
country
around
crofield
i
keep
on
trying
anyway
he
said
there
a
place
for
me
somewhere
i
try
some
other
trade
i
do
so
he
did
until
one
man
said
to
him
everybody
is
at
luncheon
just
now
begin
again
by
and
by
but
afraid
you
find
there
are
no
stores
needing
boys
i
need
some
dinner
myself
thought
jack
i
feel
faint
mister
he
added
aloud
i
must
buy
some
luncheon
too
where
a
good
place
he
was
directed
to
a
restaurant
and
he
seated
himself
at
a
table
and
ordered
roast
beef
in
a
sort
of
desperation
i
do
care
what
it
costs
he
said
i
got
some
money
yet
beef
potatoes
bread
and
butter
all
of
the
best
came
and
were
eaten
with
excellent
appetite
jack
was
half
afraid
of
the
consequences
when
the
waiter
put
a
bright
red
check
down
beside
his
plate
thirty
cents
exclaimed
he
joyfully
picking
it
up
why
that
the
cheapest
dinner
i
had
in
new
york
all
right
sir
come
again
sir
said
the
waiter
smiling
and
then
jack
sat
still
for
a
moment
six
dollars
and
more
too
he
said
to
himself
and
my
room
paid
for
besides
i
can
go
right
on
looking
up
a
place
for
days
and
days
if
i
careful
about
my
money
i
must
be
discouraged
he
certainly
felt
more
courageous
now
that
he
had
eaten
dinner
and
he
at
once
resumed
his
hunt
for
a
place
but
there
was
very
little
left
of
his
smile
he
went
into
store
after
store
with
almost
the
same
result
in
each
until
one
gentleman
remarked
to
him
my
boy
why
do
you
go
to
a
mercantile
agency
what
that
asked
jack
and
the
man
explained
what
it
was
i
go
to
one
right
away
jack
said
hopefully
that
the
address
of
a
safe
place
said
the
gentleman
writing
a
few
words
look
out
for
sharpers
though
plenty
of
such
people
in
that
business
i
wish
you
good
luck
before
long
jack
ogden
stood
before
the
desk
of
the
mercantile
agency
to
which
he
had
been
directed
answering
questions
and
registering
his
name
he
had
paid
a
fee
of
one
dollar
and
had
made
the
laugh
by
his
confidence
you
seem
to
think
you
can
take
hold
of
nearly
anything
he
said
well
your
chance
is
as
good
as
anybody
some
men
prefer
boys
from
the
country
even
if
they
ca
give
references
when
do
you
think
you
can
get
me
a
place
asked
jack
ca
tell
we
only
between
four
hundred
and
five
hundred
on
the
books
now
and
sometimes
we
get
two
or
three
dozen
fixed
in
a
day
five
hundred
exclaimed
jack
with
a
clouding
face
why
it
may
be
a
month
before
my
turn
comes
a
month
said
the
clerk
well
i
hope
not
much
longer
but
it
may
be
i
would
like
to
promise
you
anything
so
soon
as
that
jack
went
out
of
that
place
with
yet
another
idea
concerning
business
in
the
city
but
he
again
began
to
make
inquiries
for
himself
it
was
the
weariest
kind
of
work
and
at
last
he
was
heartily
sick
of
it
i
done
enough
for
one
day
he
said
to
himself
i
been
into
i
do
know
how
many
stores
i
know
more
about
it
than
i
did
this
morning
there
was
no
doubt
of
that
jack
had
been
getting
wiser
all
the
while
and
he
did
not
even
look
so
rural
as
when
he
set
out
he
was
really
beginning
to
get
into
city
ways
and
he
was
thinking
hard
and
fast
the
first
thing
he
did
after
reaching
the
hotel
dantzic
was
to
go
up
to
his
room
he
felt
as
if
he
would
like
to
talk
with
his
sister
mary
and
so
he
sat
down
and
wrote
her
a
long
letter
he
told
her
about
his
trip
all
through
and
about
his
german
friends
and
his
sunday
but
it
was
anything
but
easy
to
write
about
experiences
he
did
it
after
a
fashion
but
he
wrote
much
more
cheerfully
than
he
felt
then
he
went
down
to
the
for
some
tea
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
ordered
almost
nothing
but
it
cost
him
cents
it
would
have
done
him
good
if
he
could
have
known
how
mary
thoughts
were
at
that
same
hour
turning
to
him
at
home
jack
father
and
magruder
were
talking
about
jack
land
arranging
about
the
right
of
way
and
what
it
was
worth
while
he
sat
in
his
little
room
in
the
hotel
dantzic
thinking
over
his
long
weary
day
of
snubs
blunders
insults
and
disappointments
hunting
for
a
place
in
the
city
is
just
the
meanest
kind
of
work
he
said
at
last
well
i
go
to
bed
and
try
it
again
that
was
what
he
did
but
tuesday
work
was
meaner
than
monday
there
did
not
seem
to
be
even
so
much
as
a
variation
it
was
all
one
dull
monotonous
miserable
hunt
for
something
he
could
not
find
it
was
just
so
on
wednesday
and
all
the
while
as
he
said
money
will
just
melt
away
and
somehow
you
ca
help
it
when
he
counted
up
on
wednesday
evening
however
he
still
had
four
dollars
and
one
cent
and
he
had
found
a
place
where
they
sold
bread
and
milk
or
bread
and
coffee
for
ten
cents
i
can
get
along
on
that
he
said
and
it
only
a
day
if
i
eat
three
times
i
wish
i
known
about
it
when
i
first
came
here
i
learning
something
new
all
the
time
thursday
morning
came
and
with
it
a
long
gossipy
letter
from
mary
and
an
envelope
from
crofield
containing
a
letter
from
his
mother
and
a
message
from
his
father
written
by
her
saying
how
he
had
talked
a
little
only
a
little
with
magruder
there
was
a
postscript
from
aunt
melinda
and
a
separate
sheet
written
by
his
younger
sisters
with
scrawly
postscripts
from
the
little
boys
to
tell
jack
how
the
workmen
had
dug
down
and
found
the
old
church
bell
and
that
there
was
a
crack
in
it
and
the
clapper
was
broken
off
jack
felt
queer
over
those
letters
i
wo
answer
them
right
away
he
said
not
till
i
get
into
some
business
i
go
farther
down
town
today
and
try
there
at
ten
that
morning
a
solemn
party
of
seven
men
met
in
the
back
room
of
the
mertonville
bank
gentlemen
of
the
board
of
trustees
please
come
to
order
i
suppose
we
all
agree
we
need
a
teacher
of
experience
the
academy
not
doing
well
the
lady
principal
ca
do
everything
she
must
have
a
good
assistant
who
your
candidate
squire
crowninshield
asked
judge
edwards
i
trustee
as
judge
of
the
county
court
i
had
applications
for
my
vote
i
had
more
than
that
said
the
squire
good
humoredly
i
name
my
choice
till
after
the
first
ballot
i
want
to
know
who
are
the
other
candidates
first
so
do
i
said
judge
edwards
i
wo
name
mine
at
once
either
who
is
yours
elder
holloway
we
better
have
a
nominating
ballot
remarked
the
elder
handing
a
folded
slip
of
paper
to
murdoch
the
editor
of
the
who
is
yours
mr
jeroliman
i
have
any
candidate
replied
the
with
a
worried
look
i
wo
name
any
but
i
put
a
ballot
in
try
that
then
said
general
smith
who
was
standing
instead
of
sitting
down
at
the
long
table
just
a
suggestion
every
trustee
had
something
to
say
as
to
how
he
had
been
besieged
by
applicants
until
the
seventh
who
remarked
i
just
returned
from
europe
gentlemen
i
vote
for
the
candidate
having
the
most
votes
on
this
ballot
i
do
care
who
wins
i
agree
to
that
quickly
responded
general
smith
handing
him
a
folded
paper
put
it
in
dillingham
it
better
that
none
of
us
should
do
any
or
try
to
influence
others
i
adopt
your
idea
i
wo
then
said
squire
crowninshield
pleasantly
but
very
positively
murdoch
what
the
name
of
that
young
woman
who
edited
the
for
a
week
miss
mary
ogden
said
the
editor
with
a
slight
smile
a
clever
girl
said
the
squire
as
he
wrote
on
a
paper
folded
it
and
threw
it
into
a
hat
in
the
middle
of
the
table
he
had
not
heard
judge
edwards
whispered
exclamation
that
reminds
me
i
promised
my
wife
that
i
mention
mary
for
the
place
but
then
there
was
the
ghost
of
a
chance
in
went
all
the
papers
and
the
hat
was
turned
over
now
gentlemen
said
general
smith
before
the
ballots
are
opened
and
counted
i
wish
to
ask
is
this
vote
to
be
considered
regular
and
formal
shall
we
stand
by
the
result
certainly
certainly
said
the
trustees
in
chorus
count
the
ballots
said
the
elder
the
hat
was
lifted
and
the
count
began
one
two
three
four
five
six
seven
for
mary
ogden
said
elder
holloway
calmly
i
declare
said
general
smith
unanimous
why
gentlemen
we
were
agreed
there
really
was
no
difference
of
opinion
whatever
i
glad
she
is
such
a
favorite
said
judge
edwards
but
we
raise
the
salary
on
that
account
it
have
to
remain
at
forty
dollars
a
month
i
glad
she
got
it
said
murdoch
and
a
unanimous
vote
is
a
high
testimonial
and
so
mary
was
elected
each
of
them
had
other
business
to
attend
to
and
it
was
not
until
judge
edwards
went
home
at
noon
that
the
news
was
known
to
mary
for
the
judge
carried
the
pleasant
tidings
to
mary
ogden
at
the
oh
judge
edwards
exclaimed
mary
turning
pale
i
at
my
age
to
be
assistant
principal
of
the
academy
there
only
the
primary
department
to
teach
said
the
judge
encouragingly
not
half
so
hard
as
that
big
overgrown
class
only
it
never
had
a
good
teacher
yet
and
you
have
hard
work
to
get
it
into
order
what
will
they
say
in
crofield
said
mary
uneasily
they
say
not
fit
for
it
i
sure
miss
glidden
will
not
said
edwards
proudly
glad
it
was
unanimous
it
shows
what
they
all
thought
of
you
perhaps
it
did
but
perhaps
it
was
as
well
for
mary
ogden
temper
that
she
could
not
hear
all
that
was
said
when
the
other
trustees
went
home
to
announce
their
action
it
was
a
great
hour
for
mary
but
her
brother
jack
was
at
that
same
time
beginning
to
think
that
new
york
city
was
united
against
him
a
million
and
a
half
to
one
he
had
been
fairly
turned
out
of
the
last
store
he
had
entered
chapter
xvi
jack
famine
at
crofield
the
morning
mail
brought
a
letter
from
mary
telling
of
her
election
there
was
not
so
very
much
comment
but
ogden
cried
a
little
and
said
i
feel
as
if
we
were
beginning
to
lose
the
children
i
must
go
to
work
said
the
tall
blacksmith
after
a
time
but
i
do
feel
like
it
so
mary
to
teach
is
she
she
seems
very
young
i
wish
i
knew
about
jack
meanwhile
poor
jack
was
half
hopelessly
inquiring
of
man
after
man
whether
or
not
another
boy
was
wanted
in
his
store
it
was
only
one
long
flat
monotony
of
no
sir
and
at
last
he
once
more
turned
his
weary
footsteps
and
hardly
had
he
done
so
before
he
waked
up
a
little
and
stood
still
and
looked
around
him
hullo
he
exclaimed
i
never
was
here
before
this
must
be
chatham
square
and
the
bowery
i
read
about
them
in
the
i
can
go
home
this
way
it
not
much
like
broadway
so
he
thought
as
he
went
along
and
it
did
not
at
all
resemble
broadway
it
seemed
to
swarm
with
people
they
appeared
to
be
attending
to
their
own
business
and
they
were
all
behaving
very
well
so
far
as
jack
could
see
never
saw
such
a
jam
said
jack
as
he
pushed
into
a
small
throng
on
a
street
corner
trying
to
get
through
but
at
the
word
jam
something
came
down
upon
the
top
of
his
hat
and
forced
it
forward
over
his
eyes
up
went
both
of
his
hands
instinctively
and
at
that
moment
each
arm
was
at
once
caught
and
held
up
for
a
second
or
two
it
was
all
done
in
a
flash
jack
knew
that
some
boisterous
fellow
had
jammed
his
hat
over
his
eyes
and
that
others
had
hustled
him
a
little
but
he
had
not
been
hurt
and
he
did
not
feel
like
quarreling
just
then
he
pushed
along
through
the
throng
and
was
getting
out
to
where
the
crowd
was
thinner
when
he
suddenly
felt
a
chill
and
a
weak
feeling
at
his
heart
he
had
thrust
his
hand
into
his
pocket
my
he
said
faintly
it
gone
where
could
i
have
lost
it
i
have
taken
it
out
anywhere
and
there
was
more
than
three
dollars
in
it
i
saved
to
pay
for
my
room
he
leaned
heavily
against
a
for
a
moment
and
all
the
bright
ideas
he
had
ever
had
about
the
city
became
very
dim
and
far
away
he
put
up
one
hand
before
his
eyes
and
at
that
moment
his
arm
was
firmly
grasped
here
boy
what
the
matter
he
looked
up
and
saw
a
blue
uniform
and
a
hand
with
a
club
in
it
but
he
could
not
say
a
word
in
reply
you
seem
all
right
are
you
sick
i
lost
my
said
jack
every
cent
i
had
except
some
change
illustration
i
lost
my
that
bad
and
the
officer
understood
the
matter
at
a
glance
for
he
added
you
were
caught
in
a
crowd
and
had
your
pocket
picked
i
ca
do
anything
for
you
my
boy
it
gone
and
that
all
there
is
of
it
never
push
into
crowds
if
you
any
money
about
you
you
better
go
home
now
only
cents
left
jack
said
as
he
walked
away
for
this
evening
and
saturday
and
sunday
and
for
all
next
week
till
i
get
something
to
do
and
am
paid
for
doing
it
he
had
eaten
ten
cents
worth
of
bread
and
milk
at
noon
but
he
was
a
strong
and
healthy
boy
and
he
was
again
hungry
counting
his
change
made
him
hungrier
and
he
thought
longingly
of
the
brilliant
at
the
hotel
dantzic
that
wo
do
he
thought
i
must
keep
away
from
keifelheimer
and
his
restaurant
there
now
that
something
like
it
was
a
small
stand
close
by
a
cellar
way
half
was
covered
with
apples
candy
peanuts
bananas
oranges
and
the
other
half
was
a
a
newspaper
stand
and
an
jack
interest
centered
on
a
basket
marked
ham
sanwiges
five
cents
i
can
afford
a
sandwich
he
said
and
i
got
to
eat
something
at
the
moment
when
he
leaned
over
and
picked
up
a
sandwich
a
small
old
woman
behind
the
counter
reached
out
her
hand
toward
him
and
another
small
old
woman
stretched
her
hand
out
to
a
boy
who
was
testing
the
oranges
and
a
third
small
old
woman
sang
out
very
shrilly
here
your
sanwiges
ham
sanwiges
only
five
cents
benannies
oranges
sanwiges
jack
put
five
cents
into
the
woman
hand
and
he
was
surprised
to
find
how
much
good
bread
and
boiled
ham
he
had
bought
it
all
the
supper
i
have
he
said
as
he
walked
away
i
could
eat
a
loaf
of
bread
and
a
whole
ham
it
seems
to
me
all
the
way
to
the
hotel
dantzic
he
studied
over
the
loss
of
his
the
policeman
was
right
he
said
to
himself
at
last
i
did
know
when
they
took
it
but
it
must
have
been
when
my
hat
was
jammed
down
when
jack
met
keifelheimer
in
the
hotel
office
he
asked
him
what
he
thought
about
it
an
expression
of
strong
indignation
if
not
of
horror
crossed
the
face
of
the
hotel
proprietor
dey
get
you
he
exclaimed
you
vas
rob
choost
de
same
vay
i
vas
but

jack
was
glad
of
so
much
sympathy
but
just
then
business
called
keifelheimer
away
i
wo
go
upstairs
thought
jack
i
sit
in
the
no
letters
were
awaiting
him
but
there
were
plenty
of
newspapers
and
nearly
a
score
of
men
were
reading
or
talking
jack
did
not
really
care
to
read
nor
to
talk
nor
even
to
listen
but
two
gentlemen
near
him
were
discussing
a
subject
that
reminded
him
of
the
farms
around
crofield
yes
he
heard
one
of
them
say
we
must
buy
every
potato
we
can
secure
at
the
rate
they
spoiling
now
the
price
will
be
doubled
before
december
curious
how
little
the
market
knows
about
it
yet
said
the
other
and
they
continued
discussing
letters
and
reports
about
potatoes
from
place
after
place
and
state
after
state
and
all
the
while
jack
listened
glad
to
be
reminded
of
crofield
it
was
just
so
with
our
potatoes
at
home
he
said
to
himself
some
farmers
did
get
back
what
they
planted
this
talk
helped
him
to
forget
his
for
a
while
then
after
trying
to
read
the
newspapers
he
went
to
bed
a
very
tired
boy
can
always
sleep
jack
ogden
awoke
on
saturday
morning
with
a
clear
idea
that
sleep
was
all
he
had
had
for
supper
excepting
one
ham
sandwich
it
not
enough
he
said
as
he
dressed
himself
i
must
make
some
money
oh
my
and
i
shall
have
to
pay
for
my
room
monday
he
slipped
out
of
the
hotel
dantzic
very
quietly
and
he
had
a
fine
sunshiny
walk
of
two
and
a
half
miles
to
the
restaurant
where
he
ate
his
ten
cents
worth
of
bread
and
milk
it
enough
for
a
while
he
said
but
it
does
last
if
i
was
at
home
now
i
have
more
bread
and
another
bowl
of
milk
i
come
here
again
at
noon
if
i
do
find
a
place
somewhere
blue
blue
blue
was
that
saturday
for
poor
jack
ogden
all
the
forenoon
he
stood
up
manfully
to
hear
the
no
we
do
want
a
boy
and
he
met
that
same
answer
expressed
in
almost
identical
words
everywhere
when
he
came
out
from
his
luncheon
of
bread
and
milk
he
began
to
find
that
many
places
closed
at
twelve
or
one
that
even
more
were
to
close
at
three
and
that
on
saturday
all
men
were
either
tired
and
cross
or
in
a
hurry
jack
courage
failed
him
until
he
could
hardly
look
a
man
in
the
face
and
ask
him
a
question
one
whole
week
had
gone
since
jack
reached
the
city
and
it
seemed
about
a
year
here
he
was
without
any
way
of
making
money
and
almost
without
a
hope
of
finding
any
way
i
go
to
the
hotel
he
said
at
about
four
i
go
up
the
bowery
way
it
wo
pay
anybody
to
pick
my
pocket
this
time
he
had
a
reason
for
going
up
the
bowery
it
was
no
shorter
than
the
other
way
the
real
explanation
was
in
his
pocket
forty
cents
left
he
said
i
eat
one
sandwich
for
supper
and
i
buy
three
more
to
eat
in
my
room
he
reached
the
stand
kept
by
the
three
small
old
women
and
found
each
in
turn
calling
out
here
you
are
sanwiges
and
all
the
rest
of
their
list
of
commodities
four
said
jack
put
up
three
of
in
a
paper
please
i
eat
one
it
was
good
in
fact
it
was
too
good
and
jack
wished
it
was
ten
times
as
large
but
the
last
morsel
of
it
vanished
speedily
and
after
looking
with
longing
eyes
at
the
others
he
shut
his
teeth
firmly
i
wo
eat
another
he
said
to
himself
i
starve
it
out
till
monday
anyway
it
took
all
the
courage
jack
had
to
carry
those
three
sandwiches
to
the
hotel
dantzic
and
to
put
them
away
untouched
in
his
after
a
while
he
went
down
to
the
and
read
but
he
went
to
bed
thinking
of
the
excellent
meals
he
had
eaten
at
the
albany
hotel
on
his
way
to
new
york
mary
ogden
second
sunday
in
mertonville
was
a
peculiar
trial
to
her
for
several
young
ladies
who
expected
to
be
in
the
academy
next
term
came
and
added
themselves
to
that
remarkable
class
so
did
some
friends
of
the
younger
academy
girls
and
the
class
had
to
be
divided
to
the
disappointment
of
those
excluded
mary
ogden
did
need
to
improve
said
elder
holloway
to
the
superintendent
but
she
is
doing
better
than
ever
how
jack
did
long
to
see
mary
or
some
of
the
family
in
crofield
and
crofield
itself
as
soon
as
he
was
dressed
he
opened
the
bag
and
took
out
one
of
his
sandwiches
and
looked
at
it
why
they
smaller
than
i
thought
they
were
he
said
ruefully
but
i
ca
expect
too
much
for
five
cents
i
just
twenty
cents
left
that
sandwich
tastes
good
if
it
is
small
so
soon
was
it
all
gone
that
jack
found
his
breakfast
very
unsatisfactory
i
do
feel
like
going
to
church
he
said
but
i
might
as
well
i
ca
sit
cooped
up
here
all
day
i
go
into
the
first
church
i
come
to
as
soon
as
it
time
he
did
not
care
where
he
went
when
he
left
the
hotel
and
perhaps
it
did
not
really
make
much
difference
considering
how
he
felt
but
he
found
a
church
and
went
in
a
young
man
showed
him
to
a
seat
under
the
gallery
not
until
the
minister
in
the
pulpit
came
forward
to
give
out
a
hymn
did
jack
notice
anything
peculiar
but
the
first
sonorous
rolling
cadences
of
that
hymn
startled
the
boy
from
crofield
whew
he
said
to
himself
it
dutch
or
something
i
understand
a
word
of
it
i
stay
though
now
i
here
german
hymns
and
german
prayers
and
a
tolerably
long
sermon
in
german
left
jack
ogden
free
to
think
of
all
sorts
of
things
and
his
spirits
went
down
down
down
as
he
recalled
all
the
famines
of
which
he
had
heard
or
read
and
all
the
delicacies
invented
to
tempt
the
appetite
he
sat
very
still
however
until
the
last
hymn
was
sung
and
then
he
walked
slowly
back
to
the
hotel
dantzic
i
do
care
to
see
keifelheimer
he
thought
he
ask
me
to
come
and
eat
at
a
big
sunday
dinner
and
to
pay
for
it
i
dodge
him
he
watched
at
the
front
door
of
the
hotel
for
fully
three
minutes
until
he
was
sure
that
the
hall
was
empty
then
he
slipped
into
the
and
through
that
into
the
rear
passageway
leading
to
the
elevator
but
he
did
not
feel
safe
until
on
his
way
to
his
room
one
sandwich
for
dinner
he
groaned
as
he
opened
his
bag
i
never
knew
what
real
hunger
was
till
i
came
to
the
city
maybe
it
wo
last
long
though
i
not
the
first
fellow
who
had
a
hard
time
before
he
made
a
start
jack
thought
that
both
the
bread
and
the
ham
were
cut
too
thin
and
that
the
sandwich
did
not
last
long
enough
i
keep
my
last
twenty
cents
though
thought
jack
and
he
tried
to
be
satisfied
before
that
afternoon
was
over
the
had
been
again
read
through
and
a
long
home
letter
was
written
i
mail
it
he
said
as
soon
as
i
get
some
money
for
stamps
i
have
said
a
word
to
them
about
famine
it
must
be
time
to
eat
that
third
sandwich
and
then
i
go
out
and
take
a
walk
the
sandwich
was
somewhat
dry
but
every
crumb
of
it
seemed
to
be
valuable
after
eating
it
jack
once
more
walked
over
and
looked
at
the
fine
houses
on
fifth
avenue
but
now
it
seemed
to
the
hungry
lad
an
utter
absurdity
to
think
of
ever
owning
one
of
them
he
stared
and
wondered
and
walked
however
and
returned
to
the
hotel
tired
out
on
monday
morning
the
ogden
family
were
at
breakfast
when
a
neat
looking
stopped
before
the
door
the
driver
sprang
to
the
ground
carefully
helped
out
a
young
woman
and
then
lifted
down
a
trunk
just
as
the
trunk
came
down
upon
the
ground
there
was
a
loud
cry
in
the
open
doorway
mother
molly
come
home
and
out
sprang
little
bob
mercy
on
us
ogden
exclaimed
and
the
whole
family
were
on
their
feet
mary
met
her
father
as
she
was
coming
in
then
picking
up
little
sally
and
kissing
her
she
said
there
was
a
way
for
me
to
come
over
this
morning
i
brought
my
books
home
to
study
till
term
begins
oh
mother
i
so
glad
to
get
back
the
blacksmith
went
out
to
thank
the
farmer
who
had
brought
her
but
the
rest
went
into
the
house
to
get
mary
some
breakfast
and
to
look
at
her
and
to
hear
her
story
ogden
said
several
times
i
do
wish
jack
was
here
too
that
very
moment
her
son
was
leaving
the
hotel
dantzic
behind
him
with
two
and
a
half
miles
to
walk
before
getting
his
breakfast
a
bowl
of
bread
and
milk
chapter
xvii
jack
ogden
that
monday
morning
had
an
idea
that
new
york
was
a
very
long
city
he
had
eaten
nothing
since
saturday
noon
excepting
the
sandwiches
and
he
felt
that
he
should
not
be
good
for
much
until
after
he
had
had
breakfast
his
mind
was
full
of
unpleasant
memories
of
the
stores
and
offices
he
had
entered
during
his
last
week
hunt
and
he
did
not
relish
renewing
it
i
must
go
ahead
though
he
thought
something
must
be
done
or
starve
every
moment
jack
felt
better
and
he
arose
from
the
table
a
little
more
like
himself
ten
cents
left
he
said
as
he
went
out
into
the
street
buy
me
one
more
bowl
of
bread
and
milk
what
shall
i
do
then
illustration
ten
cents
left
it
was
a
serious
question
and
demanded
attention
it
was
still
very
early
for
the
city
but
stores
were
beginning
to
open
and
groups
of
men
were
hurrying
along
the
sidewalks
on
their
way
to
business
jack
went
on
thinking
and
thinking
and
a
fit
of
depression
was
upon
him
when
he
entered
a
street
turning
out
from
broadway
he
had
not
tried
this
street
before
it
was
not
wide
and
it
was
beginning
to
look
busy
at
the
end
of
two
blocks
jack
uttered
an
exclamation
that
queer
he
said
they
all
sell
coffee
tea
groceries
and
that
sort
of
thing
big
stores
too
i
try
here
his
heart
sank
a
little
as
he
paused
in
front
of
a
very
bustling
establishment
bearing
every
appearance
of
prosperity
some
men
were
bringing
out
and
bags
of
coffee
to
pile
around
the
doorway
as
if
to
ask
to
walk
in
and
buy
some
the
were
already
filled
with
samples
of
sugar
coffee
and
a
dozen
other
kinds
of
goods
just
beyond
one
window
jack
could
see
the
first
of
a
row
of
three
huge
painted
red
and
back
of
the
other
window
was
more
machinery
i
go
in
anyway
he
said
setting
his
teeth
only
ten
cents
left
that
small
coin
because
it
was
all
alone
in
his
pocket
drove
him
into
the
door
two
thirds
down
the
broad
store
there
stood
a
wiry
man
giving
various
directions
to
the
clerks
and
other
men
jack
thought
he
the
he
looks
as
if
he
say
no
right
away
although
jack
heart
was
beating
fast
he
walked
boldly
up
to
this
man
mister
he
said
do
you
want
to
hire
another
boy
you
are
the
hundred
and
eleventh
boy
who
has
asked
that
same
question
within
a
week
no
responded
the
man
sharply
but
good
naturedly
gifford
came
at
that
moment
from
a
very
cheerful
voice
over
left
shoulder
i
cleaned
out
that
lot
of
potatoes
sold
two
thousand
barrels
on
my
way
down
at
a
dollar
and
a
half
a
barrel
jack
remembered
that
some
uncommonly
heavy
footsteps
had
followed
him
when
he
came
in
and
found
that
he
had
to
look
upward
to
see
the
face
of
the
speaker
who
was
unusually
tall
the
man
leaned
forward
too
so
that
jack
face
was
almost
under
his
gifford
answer
had
disappointed
jack
and
irritated
him
you
did
well
said
gifford
before
he
had
time
to
think
jack
said
a
dollar
and
a
half
well
if
you
knew
anything
about
potatoes
you
would
have
let
them
go
for
a
dollar
and
a
half
a
barrel
what
do
you
know
about
potatoes
growled
the
tall
man
leaning
an
inch
lower
and
frowning
at
jack
interruption
more
than
you
or
gifford
seems
to
said
jack
desperately
the
crop
going
to
be
short
i
know
how
it
is
up
way
tell
us
what
you
know
said
the
tall
man
sharply
and
gifford
drew
nearer
with
an
expression
of
keen
interest
upon
his
face
they
all
poor
said
jack
and
then
he
remembered
and
repeated
better
than
he
could
have
done
if
he
had
made
ready
beforehand
all
he
had
heard
the
two
men
say
in
the
hotel
dantzic
and
all
he
had
heard
in
crofield
and
mertonville
he
had
heard
the
two
men
call
each
other
by
name
and
he
ended
with
did
you
sell
your
lot
to
murphy
scales
they
buying
everywhere
that
just
what
i
did
said
the
tall
man
i
wish
i
had
i
go
right
out
and
buy
and
away
he
went
buy
some
on
my
account
said
gifford
as
the
other
man
left
the
store
see
here
my
boy
i
do
want
to
hire
anybody
but
you
seem
to
know
about
potatoes
probably
you
just
from
a
farm
what
else
do
you
know
what
can
you
do
a
good
many
things
said
jack
and
to
his
own
astonishment
he
spoke
out
clearly
and
confidently
oh
you
can
laughed
gifford
well
i
do
need
you
but
i
need
an
engineer
i
wish
you
knew
enough
to
run
a
small
why
i
can
run
a
said
jack
that
nothing
may
i
see
it
gifford
pointed
at
some
machinery
behind
the
counter
near
where
he
stood
and
at
the
apparatus
in
the
it
a
little
one
that
runs
the
and
the
he
said
you
ca
do
anything
with
it
until
a
machinist
mends
it
it
all
out
of
order
i
told
perhaps
i
can
said
jack
a
boy
who
learned
the
trade
ought
to
be
able
to
put
it
to
rights
without
another
word
jack
went
to
work
nothing
wrong
here
gifford
he
said
in
a
minute
where
are
the
and
the
and
an
well
well
exclaimed
gifford
as
he
sent
a
man
for
the
tools
do
you
think
you
can
do
it
jack
said
nothing
aloud
but
he
told
himself
why
it
a
smaller
size
but
like
the
one
in
the
office
they
get
out
of
order
easily
but
then
it
easy
to
regulate
them
you
do
know
something
said
gifford
laughing
a
few
minutes
later
when
jack
said
to
him
she
do
now
she
wo
do
very
well
added
gifford
shaking
his
head
that
engine
never
was
exactly
the
thing
it
lacks
power
it
may
be
the
too
loose
said
jack
after
studying
the
mechanism
for
a
moment
i
send
for
a
man
to
fix
it
then
no
you
need
said
jack
i
can
tighten
it
so
she
run
all
the
machinery
you
have
may
i
have
an
awl
of
course
said
gifford
put
it
to
rights
there
plenty
of
coffee
waiting
to
be
ground
jack
went
to
work
at
the
loose
belt
he
a
bright
fellow
said
gifford
to
his
if
we
wanted
another
boy
but
we
do
too
many
now
was
the
short
decisive
reply
it
was
not
long
before
the
machinery
began
to
move
good
said
gifford
i
almost
wish
i
had
something
more
for
you
to
do
but
i
really
have
if
you
could
run
that
old
exclaimed
jack
over
in
the
other
window
said
gifford
we
thought
of
printing
all
our
own
circulars
cards
and
paper
bags
but
it
a
failure
unless
we
should
hire
a
regular
printer
we
shall
have
to
i
suppose
if
you
were
a
printer
now
i
worked
at
a
press
said
jack
i
something
of
a
printer
sure
i
can
do
that
work
it
like
a
press
i
used
to
run
when
i
worked
in
that
business
jack
at
once
went
to
the
an
press
he
said
like
the
one
in
the
office
it
ought
to
be
oiled
though
it
needs
adjusting
too
no
wonder
it
would
not
work
i
can
make
it
go
the
business
of
the
store
was
beginning
steam
was
up
in
the
engine
and
the
were
grinding
merrily
gifford
and
all
his
clerks
were
busied
with
other
matters
and
jack
was
left
to
tinker
away
at
the
alligator
press
she
ready
to
run
i
start
her
he
said
at
last
he
took
an
impression
of
the
form
of
type
that
was
in
the
press
and
read
it
i
see
he
said
they
print
that
on
their
paper
bags
for
an
advertisement
i
show
it
to
gifford
there
are
plenty
of
blank
ones
lying
around
here
all
ready
to
print
he
walked
up
to
the
desk
and
handed
in
the
proof
asking
is
that
all
right
no
said
gifford
we
let
our
stock
of
bags
run
down
because
the
name
of
the
firm
was
changed
i
want
to
add
several
things
i
send
for
somebody
to
have
the
proof
corrections
made
you
need
said
jack
tell
me
what
you
want
any
boy
who
ever
worked
in
a
newspaper
office
can
do
a
little
thing
like
that
how
do
you
come
to
know
so
much
about
machinery
asked
gifford
trying
not
to
laugh
oh
said
jack
i
was
brought
up
a
blacksmith
but
i
worked
at
other
trades
and
it
was
easy
enough
to
adjust
those
things
that
what
you
been
up
to
is
it
said
gifford
i
saw
you
hammering
and
filing
and
i
wondered
what
you
accomplished
i
want
the
new
paper
bags
to
be
and
he
told
jack
what
changes
were
required
and
added
then
of
course
i
shall
need
some
circulars
three
kinds
and
some
cards
that
press
will
run
over
a
thousand
an
hour
when
it
geared
right
you
see
said
jack
positively
well
here
a
true
exclaimed
gifford
opening
his
eyes
i
begin
to
wish
we
had
a
place
for
you
it
was
nearly
noon
before
jack
had
another
sample
of
printing
ready
to
show
there
was
a
good
supply
of
type
to
be
sure
but
he
was
not
much
of
a
printer
and
did
not
come
easily
to
him
he
worked
almost
desperately
however
and
meanwhile
his
brains
were
as
busy
as
the
he
succeeded
finally
and
it
was
time
for
a
salesman
was
just
reporting
gifford
we
out
of
paper
bags
we
must
have
some
right
away
said
gifford
i
wish
that
youngster
really
knew
how
to
print
them
he
tinkering
at
it
over
there
is
that
right
asked
jack
only
a
second
later
holding
out
a
printed
bag
why
yes
that
the
thing
go
ahead
said
the
surprised
i
thought
you
failed
this
time
i
run
off
a
lot
said
jack
and
then
i
go
out
and
get
something
to
eat
no
you
wo
said
gifford
promptly
no
going
out
during
business
hours
in
house
i
have
a
luncheon
brought
to
you
i
try
you
anyhow
back
went
jack
without
another
word
but
he
thought
silently
that
saves
me
ten
cents
the
alligator
press
was
started
and
jack
fed
it
with
the
blank
paper
bags
the
salesmen
needed
and
he
began
to
feel
happy
he
was
even
happier
when
his
luncheon
was
brought
for
the
firm
of
gifford
company
saw
that
their
employees
fared
well
i
declare
said
jack
to
himself
it
the
first
full
meal
i
had
since
last
week
wednesday
i
was
starved
on
went
the
press
and
the
young
pressman
sat
doggedly
at
his
task
but
he
was
all
the
while
watching
things
in
the
store
and
hearing
whatever
there
was
to
hear
i
know
their
prices
pretty
well
he
thought
most
of
the
things
are
marked
ever
so
much
lower
than
crofield
prices
too
he
had
piles
of
printed
bags
of
different
sizes
ready
for
use
now
lying
around
him
time
to
get
at
some
of
those
circulars
he
was
saying
as
he
arose
from
his
seat
at
the
press
and
stepped
out
behind
the
counter
five
pounds
of
coffee
said
a
lady
before
the
counter
in
a
tone
of
vexation
i
waited
long
enough
mocha
and
java
mixed
cents
said
jack
quick
then
said
she
and
he
darted
away
to
fill
her
order
three
and
a
half
pounds
of
powdered
sugar
said
another
lady
as
he
passed
her
yes
said
jack
how
much
is
this
soap
asked
a
stout
old
woman
and
jack
remembered
that
price
too
he
was
not
at
all
aware
that
anybody
was
watching
him
but
he
was
just
telling
another
customer
about
tea
and
when
he
felt
a
hand
upon
his
shoulder
see
here
demanded
gifford
what
are
you
doing
behind
the
counter
i
was
afraid
they
get
tired
of
waiting
and
go
somewhere
else
said
jack
i
know
something
about
waiting
on
customers
yes
that
a
fine
tea
cents
half
pound
yes
in
a
jiffy
gifford
there
are
bags
enough
for
i
think
you
may
stay
said
the
head
of
the
house
i
did
need
another
boy
but
i
begin
to
think
i
do
need
a
blacksmith
a
carpenter
a
printer
and
a
good
sharp
salesman
as
he
was
turning
away
he
added
it
surprising
how
quickly
he
has
picked
up
our
prices
jack
fingers
were
trembling
nervously
but
his
face
brightened
as
he
did
up
that
package
gifford
waited
while
the
crofield
boy
answered
yet
another
customer
and
sold
some
coffee
and
told
jack
to
go
right
on
come
to
the
desk
he
then
said
i
do
even
know
your
name
come
very
hot
and
yet
a
little
shaky
was
jack
as
he
followed
but
gifford
was
not
a
verbose
man
jones
he
said
to
the
head
clerk
please
take
down
his
name
what
is
it
john
ogden
sir
and
after
other
questions
and
answers
gifford
said
find
a
cheaper
you
can
get
good
board
for
five
dollars
a
week
your
pay
is
only
ten
dollars
a
week
to
begin
and
you
must
live
on
that
we
see
that
you
earn
it
too
you
can
begin
printing
circulars
and
cards
jack
went
and
gifford
added
why
jones
he
saved
sending
for
three
different
workmen
since
he
came
in
he
make
a
good
salesman
too
he
a
boy
but
he
only
a
boy
i
keep
him
jack
went
to
the
press
as
if
in
a
dream
a
place
he
said
to
himself
well
yes
i
got
a
place
good
wages
too
but
i
suppose
they
wo
pay
until
saturday
night
how
am
i
to
keep
going
until
then
i
have
to
pay
my
bill
at
the
hotel
dantzic
too
now
i
begun
on
a
new
week
i
go
without
my
supper
and
buy
a
sandwich
in
the
morning
and
then
i
get
along
somehow
he
worked
all
that
afternoon
with
an
uneasy
feeling
that
he
was
being
watched
the
paper
bags
were
finished
a
fair
supply
of
them
and
then
the
type
for
the
circular
needed
only
a
few
changes
and
he
began
on
that
each
new
job
made
him
remember
things
he
had
learned
in
the
office
or
had
gathered
from
black
the
wooden
foreman
of
the
it
was
just
as
well
however
that
things
needed
only
fixing
up
and
not
setting
anew
for
that
might
have
been
a
little
beyond
him
as
it
was
he
overcame
all
difficulties
besides
leaving
the
press
three
times
to
act
as
salesman
gifford
kept
open
to
accommodate
customers
who
purchased
goods
on
their
way
home
and
it
was
after
nearly
all
other
business
houses
excepting
such
as
theirs
were
closed
that
the
very
tall
man
leaned
in
at
the
door
and
then
came
striding
down
the
store
to
the
desk
gifford
he
said
that
clerk
of
yours
was
right
there
almost
a
panic
in
potatoes
i
got
five
thousand
barrels
for
you
and
five
thousand
for
myself
at
a
dollar
and
sixty
and
the
price
just
jumped
they
will
bring
two
dollars
if
they
do
we
make
two
thousand
apiece
i
glad
you
did
so
well
said
gifford
dryly
but
do
say
much
to
him
about
it
let
him
alone
well
yes
but
i
want
to
do
something
for
him
give
him
this
ten
dollar
bill
from
me
very
well
said
gifford
you
owe
the
profit
to
him
i
take
care
of
my
side
of
the
matter
ogden
come
here
a
moment
jack
stopped
the
press
and
came
to
the
desk
the
money
was
handed
to
him
it
just
a
bit
of
luck
said
the
tall
man
but
your
information
was
valuable
to
me
thank
you
said
jack
after
he
had
in
vain
refused
the
money
you
done
enough
said
gifford
this
will
do
for
your
first
day
eight
in
the
morning
remember
i
glad
i
belong
here
jack
said
to
himself
if
i
had
my
pick
of
the
city
i
would
have
chosen
this
very
store
ten
dollars
i
can
pay
keifelheimer
now
and
i
have
to
starve
to
death
jack
felt
so
prosperous
that
he
walked
only
to
the
nearest
station
of
the
elevated
railway
and
cheerfully
paid
five
cents
for
a
ride
when
the
hotel
dantzic
was
reached
it
seemed
a
much
more
cheerful
and
building
than
it
had
appeared
when
he
left
it
in
the
morning
and
jack
had
now
no
notion
of
dodging
keifelheimer
there
he
stood
on
the
doorstep
looking
stern
and
dignified
he
was
almost
too
polite
when
jack
said
mr
keifelheimer
he
replied
with
a
bow
i
hope
you
gets
along
vell
mit
your
beezness
pretty
well
said
jack
cheerfully
vere
vas

feexed
asked
keifelheimer
doubtfully
jack
held
out
one
of
the
business
cards
of
gifford
company
and
replied
that
where
i
am
i
guess

my

of

then

when
he
came
down
keifelheimer
was
waiting
for
him
very
smiling
but
not
nearly
so
polite
and
dignified
hardly
were
they
seated
at
the
before
the
proprietor
coughed
twice
affectedly
and
then
remarked

probably
he
had
now
forgotten
just
what
he
had
thought
of
saying
to
jack
in
case
the
boy
had
not
been
able
to
pay
for
his
room
and
had
been
out
of
employment
but
jack
was
enjoying
a
fine
illustration
of
that
wise
proverb
which
says
nothing
succeeds
like
success
chapter
xviii
the
drummer
boy
the
ogden
family
had
said
very
little
outside
of
their
own
house
about
the
news
of
mary
success
in
mertonville
but
on
that
monday
morning
miss
glidden
received
no
less
than
four
letters
and
each
of
them
congratulated
her
over
the
election
of
her
dear
young
friend
and
commented
on
how
glad
she
must
be
well
she
said
to
herself
of
course
i
glad
and
i
did
all
i
could
for
her
she
owes
it
all
to
me
i
go
and
see
her
mary
ogden
had
so
much
talking
to
do
and
so
many
questions
to
answer
at
the
breakfast
table
that
her
cup
of
coffee
was
cold
before
she
could
drink
it
and
then
she
and
her
mother
and
her
aunt
went
into
the
parlor
to
continue
their
talk
john
ogden
himself
waited
there
a
long
time
before
going
over
to
the
shop
his
helper
had
the
forge
ready
and
the
tall
blacksmith
at
once
put
a
rod
of
iron
into
the
fire
and
began
to
blow
the
bellows
the
rod
was
at
white
heat
and
was
out
on
the
anvil
in
no
time
and
the
hammer
began
to
ring
upon
it
to
flatten
it
out
when
john
heard
somebody
speak
to
him
ogden
what
are
you
making
i
been
watching
you
and
i
imagine
well
deacon
hawkins
said
the
blacksmith
you
have
to
tell
the
fact
is
i
was
thinking
well
my
daughter
has
just
come
home
i
glad
to
hear
it
and
to
hear
of
her
success
answered
the
deacon
miss
glidden
told
us
if
you
not
busy
i
wish
you
put
a
shoe
on
my
mare
off
hind
foot
the
blacksmith
then
went
to
work
in
earnest
and
meanwhile
mary
at
the
house
was
receiving
the
congratulations
of
her
friends
why
mary
ogden
my
dear
are
you
here
exclaimed
miss
glidden
i
so
glad
i
sure
i
did
all
i
could
for
you
my
dear
mary
exclaimed
another
and
mary
shook
hands
heartily
with
both
her
callers
and
expressed
her
gratitude
to
miss
glidden
it
was
a
day
of
triumph
for
mary
and
it
must
have
been
for
miss
glidden
for
she
seemed
to
be
continually
persuading
herself
that
much
of
the
credit
of
mary
advancement
was
hers
the
neighbors
came
and
went
and
more
than
one
of
mary
old
said
to
her
glad
you
are
so
fortunate
i
wish
could
find
something
to
do
when
the
visitors
were
gone
and
mary
tried
to
help
with
the
housework
her
mother
said
positively
now
molly
do
touch
a
thing
you
go
upstairs
to
your
books
and
do
think
of
anything
else
i
afraid
you
wo
have
half
time
enough
even
then
her
aunt
gave
the
same
advice
and
mary
was
grateful
being
unusually
eager
to
begin
her
studies
and
even
little
sally
was
compelled
to
keep
out
of
mary
room
during
the
latter
part
of
that
monday
afternoon
john
ogden
had
an
important
conference
with
magruder
the
railway
director
and
the
blacksmith
came
home
at
night
in
a
thoughtful
state
of
mind
his
son
jack
at
about
the
same
time
sat
in
his
room
at
the
hotel
dantzic
in
the
city
he
had
struggled
so
hard
to
reach
and
he
too
was
in
a
thoughtful
mood
i
write
and
tell
the
family
at
home
and
mary
he
said
after
a
while
i
wonder
whether
every
fellow
who
makes
a
start
in
new
york
has
to
almost
starve
at
the
beginning
he
was
tired
enough
to
sleep
well
when
came
but
nevertheless
he
was
downstairs
tuesday
morning
long
before
keifelheimer
hour
for
appearing
who
have
to
sit
up
late
often
rise
late
also
for
this
once
said
jack
i
have
a
prime
dantzic
hotel
breakfast
after
this
week
my
room
wo
cost
me
anything
and
i
can
begin
to
lay
up
money
i
wo
ride
down
town
though
except
in
the
very
worst
kind
of
winter
weather
it
delighted
him
to
walk
down
that
morning
and
to
know
just
where
he
was
going
and
what
work
he
had
before
him
i
sure
he
thought
that
i
know
every
building
big
and
little
all
the
way
along
i
been
ordered
out
of
most
of
these
stores
but
i
found
the
place
that
i
was
looking
for
at
last
the
porters
of
gifford
company
had
the
store
open
when
jack
got
there
and
gifford
was
just
coming
in
ogden
he
said
in
his
usual
peremptory
way
put
that
on
the
right
through
one
moment
please
gifford
said
jack
i
hardly
a
moment
to
spare
answered
gifford
what
is
it
a
customer
said
jack
the
hotel
dantzic
i
can
find
more
of
the
same
kind
perhaps
tell
me
was
the
answer
with
a
look
of
greater
interest
but
also
a
look
of
incredulity
jack
told
him
shortly
the
substance
of
his
talk
with
keifelheimer
and
gifford
listened
attentively
his
steward
and
buyers
have
been
robbing
him
have
they
he
remarked
well
he
right
about
it
no
doubt
we
can
save
him
from
ten
to
twenty
per
cent
it
a
good
idea
i
go
up
and
see
him
by
and
by
now
hurry
with
your
printing
jack
turned
to
the
waiting
alligator
and
gifford
went
on
to
his
desk
jones
he
said
to
his
head
clerk
ogden
has
drummed
us
a
good
hotel
customer
and
then
he
told
jones
about
it
gifford
said
jones
shrewdly
can
we
afford
to
keep
a
sharp
salesman
and
drummer
behind
that
little
of
course
not
said
gifford
not
after
a
week
or
so
but
we
must
wait
and
see
how
he
wears
he
very
young
and
a
stranger
young
fellows
soon
grow
said
jones
he
grow
he
pick
up
everything
that
comes
along
i
believe
you
find
him
a
valuable
salesman
very
likely
said
gifford
but
i
tell
him
so
he
has
plenty
of
confidence
as
it
is
it
not
impudence
said
jones
if
he
had
been
pushing
well
he
would
have
found
this
place
with
us
it
energy
yes
said
gifford
if
it
was
impudence
we
should
waste
no
time
with
him
if
there
is
anything
i
despise
out
and
out
it
what
is
often
called
cheek
next
he
hated
laziness
or
anything
resembling
it
and
jack
sat
behind
the
alligator
that
day
working
hard
himself
and
taking
note
of
how
gifford
kept
his
employees
busy
no
wonder
he
did
need
another
boy
he
thought
he
gets
all
the
work
possible
out
of
every
one
he
employs
that
why
he
so
successful
it
was
a
long
dull
hot
day
the
luncheon
came
at
noon
and
the
customers
came
all
the
time
but
jack
was
forbidden
to
meddle
with
them
until
his
printing
was
done
gifford
eyes
are
everywhere
said
he
but
i
hope
he
seen
anything
out
of
the
way
in
me
there
are
bags
enough
to
last
a
month
yes
two
months
i
begin
on
the
circulars
and
cards
i
glad
it
six
gifford
was
standing
near
the
door
giving
orders
to
the
porters
and
as
the
alligator
stopped
jack
said
to
him
i
think
i
will
go
visiting
among
the
other
hotels
this
evening
very
well
said
gifford
quietly
i
saw
keifelheimer
and
made
arrangements
with
him
if
you
going
out
to
the
hotels
in
our
interest
buy
another
hat
put
on
a
collar
with
a
new
necktie
the
rest
of
your
clothing
is
well
enough
do
try
to
look
dandyish
though
of
course
not
said
jack
smiling
but
i
was
thinking
about
making
some
improvements
in
my
suit
he
made
several
purchases
on
his
way
up
town
and
put
each
article
on
as
he
bought
it
the
last
improvement
was
a
neat
straw
hat
from
a
lot
that
were
selling
cheaply
and
he
looked
into
a
long
looking
glass
to
see
what
the
effect
was
illustration
buys
a
new
there
he
exclaimed
there
very
little
of
the
left
not
altogether
the
hat
and
the
collar
either
nor
the
necktie
maybe
some
of
it
was
starved
out
he
was
a
different
looking
boy
at
all
events
and
the
cashier
at
the
desk
of
the
hotel
dantzic
looked
twice
at
him
when
he
came
in
and
keifelheimer
remarked
dot
vas
a
smart
boy
his
boss
vas
here
und
i
haf
safe
money
guilderaufenberg
vas
right
about
dot
boy
jack
was
eager
to
begin
his
drumming
but
he
ate
a
hearty
supper
before
he
went
out
i
must
learn
something
about
hotels
he
remarked
thoughtfully
take
a
look
at
some
of
them
the
hotel
dantzic
was
not
small
but
it
was
small
compared
to
some
of
the
larger
hotels
that
jack
was
now
to
investigate
he
walked
into
the
first
one
he
found
and
he
looked
about
it
and
then
he
walked
out
and
went
into
another
and
looked
that
over
and
then
he
thought
he
would
try
another
he
strolled
around
through
the
halls
and
offices
and
and
all
the
public
places
but
the
more
he
saw
the
more
he
wondered
what
good
it
would
do
him
to
study
them
it
was
about
eight
in
the
evening
when
he
stood
in
front
of
the
office
of
the
great
equatorial
hotel
feeling
very
keenly
that
he
was
still
only
a
country
boy
with
very
little
knowledge
of
the
men
and
things
he
saw
around
him
a
broad
heavy
hand
came
down
upon
his
shoulder
and
a
voice
he
had
heard
before
asked
heartily
john
ogden
you
here
did
i
tell
you
not
to
stay
too
long
in
the
city
yes
you
did
governor
said
jack
turning
quickly
but
i
had
to
stay
here
i
gone
into
the
wholesale
and
retail
grocery
business
jack
already
knew
that
the
governor
could
laugh
merrily
and
that
any
other
men
who
might
happen
to
be
standing
by
were
more
than
likely
to
join
with
him
in
his
mirth
but
the
color
came
at
once
to
his
cheeks
when
the
governor
began
to
smile
in
the
grocery
business
laughed
the
governor
do
you
supply
the
equatorial
no
not
yet
but
i
like
to
said
jack
i
think
our
house
could
give
them
what
they
need
let
me
have
your
card
then
said
one
of
the
gentlemen
who
had
joined
in
the
governor
merriment
for
the
governor
has
no
time
to
spare
jack
handed
him
the
card
of
gifford
company
take
it
boulder
take
it
said
the
governor
ogden
and
i
are
old
acquaintances
he
a
protégé
of
yours
eh
said
boulder
well
i
mean
business
write
your
own
name
there
ogden
i
send
our
buyer
down
there
and
we
see
what
can
be
done
shall
we
go
in
governor
jack
understood
at
once
that
boulder
was
one
of
the
proprietors
of
the
equatorial
hotel
i
called
for
jack
said
the
governor
you
will
be
in
the
city
awhile
will
you
not
well
do
stay
here
too
long
i
came
here
once
when
i
was
about
your
age
i
staid
a
year
and
then
i
went
away
a
year
in
the
city
will
be
of
great
benefit
to
you
i
hope
governor
said
jack
seriously
we
do
the
right
thing
by
boulder
and
there
was
another
laugh
as
jack
shook
hands
with
the
governor
and
then
with
the
very
dignified
manager
of
the
equatorial
hotel
that
will
do
for
one
evening
thought
jack
as
the
distinguished
party
of
gentlemen
walked
away
i
better
go
right
home
and
go
to
bed
the
governor
a
brick
anyhow
back
he
went
to
the
hotel
dantzic
and
he
was
soon
asleep
the
alligator
press
in
gifford
company
was
opening
and
shutting
its
black
jaws
regularly
over
the
sheets
of
paper
it
was
turning
into
circulars
about
the
middle
of
wednesday
forenoon
when
a
dapper
gentleman
with
a
rather
prominent
walked
briskly
into
the
store
and
up
to
the
desk
mr
gifford
he
asked
yes
sir
i
barnes
said
the
dapper
man
general
buyer
for
the
equatorial
hotel
your
ogden
was
up
with
us
last
night
to
see
some
of
his
friends
and
i
come
down
to
look
at
your
and
so
forth
oh
quietly
remarked
gifford
our
ogden
oh
quite
right
i
think
we
can
satisfy
you
we
do
our
best
certainly
jones
please
confer
with
barnes
i
be
back
in
a
minute
up
toward
the
door
walked
gifford
but
not
too
fast
he
stood
still
when
he
arrived
at
the
alligator
press
ogden
he
said
you
can
leave
that
work
i
another
printing
hand
coming
jack
heart
beat
quickly
for
a
moment
what
could
he
be
discharged
so
suddenly
he
was
dismayed
but
gifford
went
on
wash
your
hands
ogden
and
stand
behind
the
counter
there
i
see
you
again
by
and
by
the
buyer
is
here
from
the
equatorial
i
promised
them
you
give
them
all
they
wanted
and
as
good
prices
as
could
be
had
anywhere
said
jack
with
a
great
sense
of
relief
and
recovering
his
courage
we
will
said
gifford
as
he
turned
away
and
he
did
not
think
he
must
explain
to
jack
that
it
would
not
do
for
barnes
to
find
gifford
company
salesman
ogden
running
an
alligator
press
barnes
was
in
the
store
for
some
time
but
jack
was
not
called
up
to
talk
with
him
gifford
was
the
right
man
for
that
part
of
the
affair
and
in
the
course
of
his
conversation
with
barnes
he
learned
further
particulars
concerning
the
intimacy
between
your
ogden
and
the
governor
with
the
addition
that
boulder
thinks
well
of
ogden
too
jack
waited
upon
customers
as
they
came
and
he
did
well
for
a
new
hand
but
he
felt
very
ignorant
of
both
articles
and
prices
and
the
first
thing
he
said
when
gifford
again
came
near
him
was
gifford
i
ought
to
know
more
than
i
do
about
the
stock
and
prices
of
course
you
ought
said
gifford
i
do
care
to
have
you
try
any
more
till
you
do
you
must
stay
a
few
months
behind
the
counter
and
learn
all
you
can
you
must
dress
neatly
too
i
wonder
you
looked
as
well
as
you
have
we
make
your
salary
fifteen
dollars
a
week
you
need
more
money
as
a
salesman
jack
flushed
with
pleasure
but
a
customer
was
at
hand
and
the
interruption
prevented
him
from
making
an
answer
jones
remarked
gifford
to
his
head
clerk
ogden
is
going
to
become
a
fine
salesman
i
thought
so
said
jones
they
both
were
confirmed
in
this
opinion
about
three
weeks
later
jack
was
two
hours
behind
time
one
morning
but
when
he
did
come
he
brought
with
him
guilderaufenberg
of
washington
with
reference
to
a
whole
winter
supplies
for
a
peeg
and
two
united
states
army
contractors
jack
had
convinced
these
gentlemen
that
they
were
paying
too
much
for
several
articles
that
could
be
found
on
the
list
of
gifford
company
in
better
quality
and
at
cheaper
rates
meester
giffort
said
the
german
gentleman
i
haf
drafel
de
vorlt
over
und
i
haf
nefer
met
a
better
boy
dan
dot
jack
ogden
he
knows
not
mooch
yet
alretty
but
den
he
ees
a
very
goot
boy
we
like
him
said
gifford
smiling
so
do
i
und
so
does
guilderaufenberg
und
miss
hildebrand
und
miss
said
the
german
some
day
you
lets
him
visit
us
in
vashington
so
i
do
know
perhaps
i
will
said
gifford
but
he
afterward
remarked
grimly
to
jones
if
i
should
and
he
should
meet
the
president
ogden
would
never
let
him
go
until
he
bought
some
of
our
tea
and
coffee
that
day
was
a
notable
one
in
both
crofield
and
mertonville
first
long
letter
telling
that
he
was
in
the
grocery
business
had
been
almost
a
damper
to
the
ogden
family
they
had
kept
alive
a
small
hope
that
he
would
come
back
soon
until
aunt
melinda
opened
an
envelope
that
morning
and
held
up
samples
of
paper
bags
cards
and
circulars
of
gifford
company
while
ogden
read
the
letter
that
came
with
them
bob
and
jim
claimed
the
bags
next
while
susie
and
bessie
read
the
circulars
and
the
tall
blacksmith
himself
straightened
up
as
if
he
had
suddenly
grown
prouder
mary
he
exclaimed
jack
always
said
he
get
to
the
city
and
he
there
and
earning
his
living
yes
but
father
she
said
with
a
small
shake
in
her
voice
i
wish
he
was
back
again
there
be
almost
room
for
him
to
work
in
crofield
now
maybe
so
maybe
so
he
replied
there
be
crowds
of
people
coming
in
when
they
begin
work
on
the
new
rail
way
and
the
bridge
i
signed
the
deeds
yesterday
for
all
the
land
they
buying
of
jack
and
me
i
wo
tell
him
about
it
quite
yet
though
i
do
wish
to
unsettle
his
mind
let
him
stay
where
he
is
this
will
be
a
trying
day
for
mary
said
aunt
melinda
thoughtfully
the
academy
will
open
at
nine
just
think
of
what
that
child
has
to
go
through
there
be
a
crowd
there
too
oh
dear
me
mary
ogden
sat
upon
the
stage
by
previous
orders
from
the
academy
principals
awaiting
the
opening
exercises
but
the
principals
themselves
had
not
yet
arrived
she
looked
rather
pale
and
she
was
intently
watching
the
gong
on
the
table
and
the
hands
of
the
clock
which
hung
upon
the
opposite
wall
perhaps
the
principals
are
here
mary
thought
as
the
clock
hands
crept
along
but
they
said
to
strike
the
bell
at
nine
precisely
and
if
they
not
here
i
must
do
it
at
the
second
of
time
up
stood
mary
and
the
gong
sounded
sharply
that
was
for
silence
and
it
was
very
silent
all
over
the
hall
and
all
the
scholars
looked
at
mary
and
waited
clang
went
the
gong
again
and
every
boy
and
girl
arose
as
if
they
had
been
trained
to
it
poor
mary
was
thinking
i
hope
nobody
sees
how
scared
i
am
but
the
academy
term
was
well
opened
and
dillingham
was
speaking
when
the
reverend
lysander
pettigrew
and
henderson
the
tardy
principals
came
hurrying
in
to
explain
that
an
accident
had
delayed
them
chapter
xix
complete
success
two
years
passed
there
was
a
great
change
in
the
outward
aspect
of
crofield
the
new
bridge
over
the
cocahutchie
was
of
iron
resting
on
stone
piers
and
the
village
street
crossed
it
the
railroad
bridge
was
just
below
but
was
covered
in
with
a
shed
so
that
the
trains
might
not
frighten
horses
the
mill
was
still
in
its
place
but
the
dam
was
two
feet
higher
and
the
pond
was
wider
between
the
mill
and
the
bridge
was
a
large
building
of
brick
and
stone
that
looked
like
a
factory
between
the
street
and
the
railway
the
space
was
filled
by
the
and
freight
depot
which
extended
to
main
street
and
there
were
more
railway
buildings
on
the
other
side
of
the
cocahutchie
just
below
the
railroad
and
along
the
bank
of
the
creek
the
ground
was
covered
by
wooden
buildings
and
there
was
a
strong
smell
of
leather
and
of
course
the
old
washington
hotel
was
gone
but
across
the
street
on
the
corner
to
the
left
there
was
a
great
brick
building
four
stories
high
with
washington
hotel
painted
across
the
front
of
it
the
stores
in
that
building
were
just
finished
looking
up
main
street
or
looking
down
it
did
not
seem
the
same
village
the
new
church
in
the
middle
of
the
green
was
built
of
stone
and
both
of
the
other
churches
were
rapidly
being
demolished
as
if
new
ones
also
were
to
take
their
places
it
was
plain
at
a
glance
that
if
this
improvement
was
general
the
village
must
be
extending
its
bounds
rapidly
for
there
never
had
been
too
much
room
in
it
for
even
the
old
buildings
with
which
jack
had
been
familiar
jack
ogden
had
not
been
in
crofield
while
all
this
work
was
going
on
his
first
week
with
gifford
company
seemed
the
most
exciting
week
that
he
had
ever
known
and
the
second
was
no
less
busy
and
interesting
he
did
not
go
to
the
german
church
the
second
sunday
but
later
he
did
somehow
drift
into
another
place
of
worship
where
the
sermon
was
preached
in
welsh
well
said
jack
when
he
came
out
at
the
close
of
the
service
i
think
i
go
back
to
the
church
i
went
to
first
i
do
look
so
green
now
as
i
did
then
but
i
sure
the
general
will
remember
me
he
carried
out
this
determination
the
next
sunday
the
sexton
gave
him
a
seat
and
he
took
it
remarking
to
himself
a
fellow
feels
more
at
home
in
a
place
where
he
been
before
there
the
general
i
wish
i
was
in
his
pew
i
speak
to
him
when
he
comes
out
the
great
man
appeared
in
due
season
and
as
he
passed
down
the
aisle
he
came
to
a
boy
who
was
just
leaving
a
pew
with
a
smile
on
his
face
the
boy
held
out
his
hand
and
bowed
said
the
general
shaking
hands
promptly
and
bowing
graciously
in
return
then
he
added
i
hope
you
come
here
every
sunday
illustration
speaks
to
the
that
was
all
but
jack
received
at
least
a
bow
every
sunday
for
four
weeks
on
the
monday
after
the
fourth
sunday
the
door
of
gifford
company
store
was
shadowed
by
the
entrance
of
a
very
man
who
stalked
straight
on
to
the
desk
where
he
was
greeted
cordially
by
gifford
for
he
seemed
to
be
an
old
friend
you
have
a
boy
here
named
john
ogden
asked
the
general
yes
general
said
gifford
a
fine
young
fellow
is
he
doing
well
asked
the
general
we
no
fault
to
find
with
him
was
the
answer
do
you
care
to
see
him
he
out
on
business
just
now
no
i
do
care
to
see
him
said
the
general
tell
him
please
that
i
called
i
feel
interested
in
his
progress
that
all
mr
gifford
the
head
of
the
firm
bowed
the
general
out
and
came
back
to
say
to
jones
that
youngster
beats
me
he
can
pick
up
a
millionaire
or
a
governor
as
easily
as
he
can
measure
a
pound
of
coffee
some
might
think
him
rather
bold
said
jones
but
i
do
he
is
absorbed
in
his
work
and
he
puts
it
through
he
the
kind
of
boy
we
want
no
doubt
of
that
see
what
he
up
to
this
morning
said
gifford
it
all
right
he
asked
leave
and
i
told
him
he
might
go
jack
had
missed
seeing
the
general
because
he
did
not
know
enough
of
the
grocery
business
he
had
said
to
gifford
i
think
gifford
i
ought
to
know
more
about
this
business
from
its
very
beginnings
if
you
let
me
i
like
to
see
where
we
get
supplies
that
meant
a
toilsome
round
among
the
great
sugar
refineries
on
the
long
island
side
of
the
east
river
and
then
another
among
the
tea
and
coffee
merchants
and
brokers
away
down
town
looking
at
samples
of
all
sorts
and
finding
out
how
cargoes
were
unloaded
from
ships
and
were
bought
and
sold
among
the
dealers
he
brought
to
the
store
that
afternoon
before
six
about
forty
samples
of
all
kinds
of
grocery
goods
all
labeled
with
prices
and
places
and
he
was
going
on
to
talk
about
them
when
gifford
stopped
him
there
ogden
he
said
i
know
all
about
these
myself
but
where
did
you
find
that
coffee
i
want
some
and
this
tea
it
is
two
cents
lower
than
i
paying
jones
he
found
just
the
tea
you
and
i
were
talking
of
and
so
he
went
on
carefully
examining
the
other
samples
and
out
of
them
all
there
were
seven
different
articles
that
gifford
company
bought
largely
next
day
jones
said
gifford
when
he
came
back
from
buying
them
they
had
our
card
in
each
place
and
told
me
ogden
was
in
here
yesterday
we
took
him
for
a
boy
at
first
i
beginning
to
think
there
are
some
things
that
only
that
kind
of
boy
can
do
i
just
let
him
go
ahead
in
his
own
way
mary
had
told
jack
all
about
her
daily
experiences
in
her
letters
to
him
and
he
said
to
himself
more
than
once
dudley
edwards
must
be
a
fellow
it
good
of
him
to
drive
mary
over
to
crofield
and
back
every
saturday
and
they
have
had
such
good
sleighing
all
winter
i
wish
i
could
try
some
of
it
there
was
no
going
to
crofield
for
him
when
thanksgiving
day
came
he
could
not
afford
it
and
before
the
christmas
holidays
gifford
told
him
we
ca
spare
you
at
christmas
ogden
it
the
busiest
time
for
us
in
the
whole
year
gifford
was
an
exacting
master
and
he
kept
jack
at
it
all
through
the
following
spring
and
summer
mary
had
a
good
rest
during
the
hot
weather
but
jack
did
not
one
thing
that
seemed
strange
to
her
was
that
so
many
of
the
crofield
ladies
called
to
see
her
and
that
miss
glidden
was
more
and
more
inclined
to
suggest
that
mary
election
had
been
mainly
due
to
her
own
influence
in
mertonville
on
the
other
hand
it
seemed
to
jack
that
summer
as
if
everybody
he
knew
was
out
of
the
city
business
kept
pressing
him
harder
and
harder
and
all
the
plans
he
made
to
get
a
leave
of
absence
for
that
second
year
thanksgiving
day
failed
to
work
successfully
the
christmas
holidays
came
again
but
throughout
the
week
gifford
company
store
kept
open
until
eight
every
evening
with
jack
ogden
behind
the
counter
he
got
so
tired
that
he
hardly
cared
about
it
when
they
raised
his
salary
to
dollars
a
week
just
after
gifford
saw
him
come
down
town
with
another
coffee
and
tea
dealer
whose
store
was
in
the
same
street
we
must
let
him
leave
us
jones
gifford
had
said
to
his
head
clerk
i
am
going
to
send
him
to
washington
next
week
not
many
days
later
guilderaufenberg
in
her
home
at
washington
was
told
by
her
maid
servant
that
there
a
strange
below
who
sez
he
to

went
the
landlady
into

and
then
up

said
jack
shaking
hands
heartily
how
is
guilderaufenberg
and
how
is
miss
oh

hildebrand
she
said
she

be
so

a
congressman
from
far
vest

exclaimed
jack
but
in
another
second
he
understood
it
and
asked
after
his
old
friend
with
the
unpronounceable
name
as
well
as
after
miss
hildebrand
she
has
a
name
now
that
i
can
speak
i
glad
smith
is
a
polish
name
he
said
to
himself
oh

exclaimed
guilderaufenberg
a
moment
later
how
haf
you
learned
to
speak
german
she
will
be
so
astonish
that
was
one
use
he
had
made
of
his
evenings
and
he
had
improved
by
speaking
to
all
the
germans
he
had
met
down
town
and
his
german
was
a
great
delight
to
guilderaufenberg
and
to
miss
hildebrand
and
to
smith
formerly
miss
pod
ski
when
he
called
to
see
them
so
said
guilderaufenberg

and

vashington
jack
did
so
but
he
had
business
errands
also
and
he
somehow
managed
to
accomplish
his
commissions
so
that
gifford
was
quite
satisfied
when
he
returned
to
new
york
i
have
sold
so
many
goods
said
jack
but
then
i
seen
the
city
of
washington
and
i
shaken
hands
with
the
president
and
with
senators
and
congressmen
gifford
how
soon

make
a
visit
to
crofield
we
arrange
that
as
soon
as
warm
weather
comes
said
his
employer
make
it
your
summer
vacation
jack
had
to
be
satisfied
he
knew
that
more
was
going
on
in
the
old
village
than
had
been
told
him
in
any
of
his
letters
from
home
his
father
was
a
man
who
dreaded
to
write
letters
and
mary
and
the
rest
of
them
were
either
too
busy
or
else
did
not
know
just
what
news
would
be
most
interesting
to
jack
i
going
to
see
crofield
said
he
a
hundred
times
after
the
days
began
to
grow
longer
i
want
to
see
the
trees
and
the
grass
and
i
want
to
see
corn
growing
and
wheat
harvesting
i
even
like
to
be
stung
by
a
bumblebee
he
became
so
eager
about
it
at
last
that
he
went
home
by
rail
all
the
way
in
a
night
train
and
he
arrived
at
crofield
over
the
new
railroad
just
as
the
sun
was
rising
one
bright
june
morning
goodness
he
exclaimed
as
he
walked
out
of
the
station
it
not
the
same
village
i
wo
go
over
to
the
house
and
wake
the
family
until
i
looked
around
from
where
he
stood
he
gazed
at
the
new
hotel
and
took
a
long
look
up
and
down
main
street
then
he
walked
eagerly
down
toward
the
bridge
hullo
he
said
in
amazement
our
house
is
there
why
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
i
knew
that
the
shop
had
been
moved
up
to
the
back
lot
they
building
houses
along
the
road
across
the
cocahutchie
why
have
they
written
and
told
me
of
all
this
he
saw
the
bridge
the
factory
the
tannery
and
many
other
buildings
but
he
did
not
see
the
familiar
old
blacksmith
shop
on
the
back
lot
i
do
know
where
we
live
nor
where
to
find
my
home
he
said
almost
dejectedly
they
know
i
coming
though
and
they
must
have
meant
to
surprise
me
mary
at
home
too
for
her
vacation
he
walked
up
main
street
leaving
his
baggage
at
the
station
new
new
new
all
the
buildings
for
several
blocks
and
then
he
came
to
houses
that
were
just
as
they
used
to
be
one
pretty
white
house
stood
back
among
some
trees
on
a
corner
and
as
jack
walked
nearer
a
tall
man
in
the
door
of
it
stepped
quickly
out
to
the
gate
he
seemed
to
be
trying
to
say
something
but
all
he
did
for
a
moment
was
to
beckon
with
his
hand
illustration
returns
father
shouted
jack
as
he
sprang
forward
jack
my
son
how
are
you
is
this
our
house
asked
jack
yes
this
is
our
house
they
all
getting
up
early
too
because
you
coming
there
are
some
things
i
want
to
talk
about
though
before
they
know
you
actually
here
walk
along
with
me
a
little
way
on
back
down
main
street
walked
jack
with
his
father
until
they
came
to
what
was
now
labeled
bridge
street
when
jack
lived
in
crofield
the
road
had
no
name
see
that
store
on
the
corner
asked
ogden
it
a
store
is
it
very
said
jack
well
now
said
his
father
i
going
to
run
that
store
and
i
do
wish
you
were
to
be
in
it
with
me
there
will
be
none
too
much
room
in
it
for
bob
and
jim
said
jack
they
growing
up
you
know
you
listen
to
me
continued
the
tall
blacksmith
trying
to
be
calm
the
railway
company
paid
me
quite
a
snug
sum
of
money
for
what
they
needed
of
your
land
and
mine
magruder
did
it
for
you
i
bought
with
the
money
thirty
acres
of
land
just
across
the
cocahutchie
to
the
left
of
the
bridge
half
of
it
was
yours
to
begin
with
and
now
i
traded
you
the
other
half
do
speak
listen
to
me
most
of
it
was
rocky
but
the
railway
company
opened
a
quarry
on
it
getting
out
their
stone
and
it
paying
handsomely
livermore
has
built
that
hotel
block
i
put
in
the
stone
and
our
old
house
lot
and
i
own
the
corner
store
except
that
livermore
can
use
the
upper
stories
for
his
hotel
the
factory
company
traded
me
ten
shares
of
their
stock
for
part
of
your
land
on
which
they
built
i
traded
that
stock
for
ten
acres
of
rocky
land
along
the
road
across
the
cocahutchie
up
by
the
mill
that
makes
forty
acres
there
father
exclaimed
jack
all
it
cost
me
was
catching
a
runaway
team
and
your
bill
against
the
miller
crofield
is
better
than
the
grocery
business
in
new
york
listen
said
his
father
smiling
the
tannery
company
traded
me
a
lot
of
their
stock
for
the
rest
of
my
back
lot
and
for
the
rest
of
your
gravel
and
they
tore
down
the
blacksmith
shop
and
i
traded
their
stock
and
some
other
things
for
the
house
where
we
live
i
made
your
part
good
to
you
with
the
land
across
the
creek
and
that
where
the
new
village
of
crofield
is
to
be
i
did
see
a
cent
of
money
in
any
of
those
trades
but
i
a
thousand
dollars
laid
up
and
i
only
working
in
the
railroad
shop

jim
well

said
his
father
slowly
come
let
us
go
home
your
mother
has
hardly
been
able
to
wait
to
see
you
when
they
came
in
sight
of
the
house
the
stoop
and
the
front
gate
were
thronged
with
but
jack
could
not
see
clearly
for
a
moment
the
sunshine
or
something
else
got
into
his
eyes
then
there
were
pairs
of
arms
large
and
small
embracing
him
and
well
it
was
a
happy
time
and
mary
was
there
and
his
mother
and
the
family
were
all
together
once
more
how
you
have
grown
said
his
aunt

grown
i
do
wish
you
come
home
to
stay
exclaimed
his
mother
perhaps
he
will
said
his
father
and
mary
had
hardly
said
a
word
till
then
but
now
it
seemed
to
burst
out
in
spite
of
her
oh
jack
she
said
if
i
could
go
back
with
you
when
you
go
i
could
live
with
a
sister
of
edwards
she
invited
me
to
live
with
her
for
a
whole
year
and
i
could
finish
my
education

saved
some
money
mary
answered
jack
i

pay
all
the
other

jack
said
his
father
thoughtfully
i
am
sure
that
you
are
a
city
boy
that
was
a
great
vacation
but
no
trout
were
now
to
be
caught
in
the
cocahutchie
the
new
store
on
the
corner
was
to
be
opened
in
the
autumn
and
jack
insisted
upon
having
it
painted
a
bright
red
about
the
windows
there
were
visits
to
mertonville
and
there
were
endless
talks
about
what
jack
land
was
going
to
be
worth
some
day
but
the
days
flew
by
and
soon
his
time
was
up
and
he
had
to
go
back
to
the
city
he
and
mary
went
together
and
they
went
down
the
hudson
river
in
the
steamer
columbia
dudley
edwards
of
mertonville
went
at
the
same
time
to
attend
to
some
law
business
he
said
in
new
york
jack
told
gifford
all
about
the
crofield
and
his
employer
answered
that
is
the
thing
for
you
ogden
you
have
some
capital
when
you
come
of
age
and
then
we
can
take
you
in
as
a
junior
partner

in
the
city

could
take
you

jack
roguishly
the
first
time

into
this
store

me

i
shall
always
do
my
best
