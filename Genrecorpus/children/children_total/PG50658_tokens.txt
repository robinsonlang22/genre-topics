i
talk
of
dreams
which
are
the
children
of
an
idle
brain
begot
of
nothing
but
vain
fantasy
which
is
as
thin
of
substance
as
the
the
feather
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
king
who
reigned
over
a
country
as
yet
for
a
reason
you
may
learn
later
on
most
lovely
country
full
of
green
dales
and
groves
of
oak
a
land
of
dappled
meadows
and
sweet
rivers
a
green
cup
in
a
circlet
of
mountains
in
whose
shadow
the
grass
was
greenest
and
the
only
road
to
enter
the
country
lay
up
steep
boiling
waterfalls
and
thereafter
through
rugged
passes
the
channels
that
the
rivers
had
cut
for
themselves
therefore
as
you
may
imagine
the
dwellers
in
the
land
were
little
troubled
by
inroads
of
hostile
nations
and
they
lived
peaceful
lives
managing
their
own
affairs
and
troubling
little
about
the
rest
of
the
world
now
this
king
like
many
kings
before
and
after
him
had
a
daughter
who
while
very
young
had
i
am
sorry
to
say
been
very
and
the
king
on
the
death
of
his
wife
finding
himself
utterly
unable
to
manage
the
princess
handed
her
over
to
the
care
of
an
aged
nurse
who
however
was
not
much
more
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
for
years
everything
went
on
smoothly
and
it
seemed
as
if
everything
intended
to
go
on
smoothly
until
doomsday
in
which
case
this
history
would
probably
never
have
been
written
but
one
evening
in
summer
the
princess
and
her
nurse
who
had
by
this
time
become
less
able
than
ever
to
manage
her
charge
sat
on
a
terrace
facing
the
west
the
princess
had
been
amusing
herself
by
pelting
the
swans
swimming
in
the
river
with
which
the
indignant
swans
snapped
up
as
they
fluttered
down
on
the
air
or
floated
by
on
the
river
but
after
a
time
she
began
to
tire
of
this
pastime
and
sitting
down
looked
at
the
sun
that
was
just
setting
a
blinding
glare
of
orange
flame
behind
the
black
hills
suddenly
she
turned
to
the
nurse
and
said
what
s
on
the
other
side
of
the
hills
miss
answered
the
nurse
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
what
a
question
to
ask
then
why
don
t
you
ask
some
one
who
has
been
there
because
no
one
ever
has
but
why
not
because
there
s
a
fiery
serpent
that
eats
every
one
who
comes
near
the
hills
and
if
you
re
not
eaten
up
you
re
bound
to
tumble
down
a
precipice
that
s
nearly
three
miles
deep
before
you
can
get
over
the
oh
what
fun
let
s
go
said
the
princess
by
no
means
awed
but
the
nurse
shook
her
head
no
miss
i
won
t
go
and
i
m
sure
your
pa
won
t
let
you
oh
yes
he
will
let
s
go
and
ask
but
at
that
moment
a
black
shadow
came
across
the
sun
and
the
swans
with
a
terrified
honk
honk
darted
across
the
water
to
hide
themselves
in
the
reeds
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
churning
dark
tracks
in
the
purple
of
the
sunlit
water
s
glassy
calmness
oh
dear
oh
dear
it
s
a
boggles
and
it
s
coming
this
way
cried
the
nurse
but
what
is
a
boggles
nurse
oh
dear
it
s
coming
come
into
the
house
and
i
ll
tell
not
until
you
tell
me
what
a
boggles
the
nurse
perforce
gave
in
a
boggles
is
a
thing
with
a
hooked
beak
and
a
squeaky
voice
with
hair
like
snakes
in
corkscrews
and
it
haunts
houses
and
carries
off
things
and
when
it
once
gets
in
it
never
leaves
dear
it
s
on
us
her
cries
only
made
the
thing
see
them
sooner
it
was
only
an
eagle
not
a
boggles
but
it
was
on
the
for
food
and
the
sun
shining
on
the
princess
s
hair
had
caught
its
eyes
and
in
spite
of
the
cries
of
the
nurse
it
swooped
down
and
seizing
the
princess
in
its
claws
began
to
carry
her
off
the
nurse
however
held
on
to
her
valiantly
screaming
all
the
while
for
help
but
the
eagle
had
the
best
of
it
after
all
for
it
carried
up
not
only
the
princess
but
the
nurse
also
the
nurse
held
on
to
her
charge
for
some
seconds
but
finding
the
attempt
useless
she
let
go
her
hold
and
since
it
happened
that
at
the
moment
they
were
over
the
river
she
fell
into
it
with
a
great
splash
and
was
drifted
on
shore
by
the
current
thus
the
princess
was
carried
off
and
although
the
land
far
and
wide
was
searched
no
traces
of
her
were
discoverable
you
may
imagine
for
yourself
what
sorrow
and
rage
the
king
indulged
in
he
turned
the
nurse
off
without
warning
and
even
in
a
paroxysm
of
rage
kicked
one
of
his
pages
downstairs
nevertheless
that
did
not
bring
back
the
princess
as
a
last
resource
he
consulted
a
wise
woman
people
called
her
a
witch
who
lived
near
the
palace
but
the
witch
could
only
say
that
the
princess
would
return
some
day
but
she
couldn
t
or
wouldn
t
say
when
even
though
the
king
threatened
to
burn
her
so
it
was
all
of
no
use
and
the
king
was
and
remained
in
despair
but
since
his
majesty
is
not
the
important
personage
in
the
story
we
may
as
well
leave
him
and
return
to
the
princess
she
as
you
can
think
was
not
particularly
happy
or
comfortable
for
the
claws
of
the
eagle
pinched
her
and
besides
she
was
very
frightened
for
you
see
she
didn
t
know
that
it
wasn
t
a
boggles
as
the
nurse
had
called
it
and
a
boggles
is
a
great
deal
worse
than
the
worst
eagle
ever
invented
meanwhile
the
eagle
continued
flying
straight
towards
the
sun
which
was
getting
lower
and
lower
so
that
by
the
time
they
reached
the
mountains
it
was
dark
altogether
but
the
eagle
didn
t
seem
at
all
afraid
of
the
darkness
and
just
went
on
flying
as
if
nothing
had
happened
until
suddenly
it
let
the
princess
down
on
a
least
that
was
what
it
seemed
to
her
to
be
not
knowing
what
else
to
do
she
sat
where
the
eagle
had
let
her
fall
for
she
remembered
something
about
the
precipice
three
miles
deep
and
she
did
not
at
all
wish
to
tumble
down
that
she
expected
that
the
eagle
would
set
to
and
make
a
meal
off
her
at
once
but
somehow
or
other
either
it
had
had
enough
to
eat
during
the
day
or
else
did
not
like
to
begin
to
have
supper
so
late
for
fear
of
nightmare
at
any
rate
it
abstained
and
that
was
the
most
interesting
matter
to
her
everything
was
so
quiet
around
that
at
last
in
spite
of
herself
she
fell
asleep
she
slept
quite
easily
until
daylight
although
the
hardness
of
the
rock
was
certainly
somewhat
unpleasant
when
she
opened
her
eyes
it
was
already
light
and
the
sun
at
her
back
was
darting
black
shadows
of
the
jagged
mountains
on
to
the
shimmering
gray
sea
of
mist
that
veiled
the
land
below
her
first
thought
was
naturally
of
the
eagle
and
she
did
not
need
to
look
very
far
for
him
since
he
was
washing
himself
in
a
little
pool
close
by
keeping
an
eye
on
her
the
while
as
soon
as
he
saw
her
move
he
gave
himself
a
final
shake
so
that
the
water
flew
all
around
sparkling
in
the
sunlight
after
which
he
came
towards
her
by
hops
until
he
was
quite
too
close
she
thought
nevertheless
she
did
not
move
having
heard
somewhere
that
under
the
circumstances
that
is
the
worst
thing
to
do
she
also
remembered
animals
can
not
stand
being
looked
at
steadily
by
the
human
eye
therefore
she
looked
very
steadfastly
at
the
eyes
of
the
eagle
but
the
remedy
did
not
seem
to
work
well
in
this
case
for
the
glassy
yellow
eyes
of
the
bird
looked
and
it
winked
angrily
seeming
to
say
whom
are
you
staring
at
and
then
it
began
to
stretch
out
its
bill
towards
her
until
it
was
within
a
few
inches
of
her
face
this
was
more
than
she
could
stand
and
she
said
sharply
take
your
head
the
eagle
however
took
no
notice
whatever
of
this
and
seeing
nothing
better
to
do
she
lifted
up
her
hand
and
gave
it
a
smart
box
on
the
ear
or
rather
on
the
place
where
its
ear
should
have
been
the
eagle
drew
back
its
beak
in
a
hurry
and
scratched
its
head
with
one
claw
as
if
it
were
puzzled
after
a
moment
s
reflection
it
put
out
its
head
again
and
once
more
the
princess
lifted
up
her
hand
but
when
the
eagle
saw
that
it
jumped
backwards
in
a
hurry
as
if
it
did
not
care
to
receive
a
second
box
on
the
ear
and
began
to
stride
sulkily
away
as
if
it
thought
it
better
to
wait
a
while
when
it
reached
the
edge
of
the
i
have
forgotten
to
tell
you
that
they
were
on
a
flat
rock
at
the
top
of
a
sat
preening
its
feathers
in
a
sulky
manner
as
if
it
imagined
itself
a
very
bird
moreover
although
it
seemed
inclined
to
remain
there
a
long
time
i
need
not
tell
you
that
the
princess
had
no
objections
however
after
a
time
even
the
waiting
began
to
grow
unpleasant
but
suddenly
a
peculiar
sound
as
of
something
shooting
through
the
air
came
from
below
and
the
eagle
gave
a
leap
and
fell
down
a
mass
of
tumbled
feathers
with
an
arrow
quivering
in
their
centre
and
with
hardly
a
shudder
it
was
dead
the
princess
as
you
may
imagine
was
a
good
deal
startled
by
this
sudden
occurrence
but
i
can
not
say
she
was
very
sorry
for
the
eagle
on
the
contrary
she
was
rather
glad
to
be
rid
of
him
and
it
suddenly
came
into
her
head
that
the
man
who
had
shot
the
arrow
might
possibly
be
somewhere
below
and
in
that
case
might
come
up
and
save
her
if
she
called
to
him
so
she
tried
to
get
up
but
she
was
so
stiff
that
she
could
hardly
move
and
when
she
did
stand
up
she
had
pins
and
needles
in
one
of
her
feet
and
had
to
stamp
hard
on
the
ground
before
it
would
go
away
so
that
it
was
some
time
before
she
got
to
the
edge
and
looked
over
now
it
happened
that
just
as
she
bent
carefully
forward
to
look
down
the
side
the
head
of
a
man
appeared
over
the
edge
and
his
hands
were
so
near
her
that
he
almost
caught
hold
of
her
foot
as
he
put
them
up
to
help
himself
as
she
drew
back
a
little
to
let
him
have
room
he
suddenly
noticed
her
and
almost
let
go
his
hold
in
astonishment
hullo
little
girl
he
said
how
did
you
come
here
it
s
rather
early
in
the
morning
for
you
to
be
up
but
who
are
you
when
you
re
at
home
i
m
the
daughter
of
king
king
how
much
king
caret
i
said
and
i
should
be
glad
if
you
would
help
me
down
from
this
height
and
show
me
the
way
how
on
earth
can
i
show
you
the
way
back
when
i
don
t
know
who
king
caret
is
but
surely
you
must
know
who
he
is
never
heard
of
him
what
s
he
like
and
what
s
he
king
of
he
s
the
king
of
and
where
s
aoland
i
don
t
s
somewhere
over
those
eagle
brought
me
here
you
ah
the
eagle
brought
you
here
did
he
it
s
a
little
habit
he
s
got
he
s
carried
off
no
end
of
my
kids
and
young
sheep
so
i
suppose
he
thought
he
d
try
a
change
and
carry
off
one
of
king
mean
caret
s
but
if
he
brought
you
from
over
the
mountains
you
won
t
get
back
in
a
hurry
i
can
tell
you
you
d
have
to
jump
up
a
precipice
three
miles
high
and
then
you
d
be
eaten
by
old
kinchof
the
oh
dear
then
i
shall
never
get
back
no
i
m
afraid
you
won
t
but
don
t
begin
to
cry
i
ll
take
you
to
king
mumkie
he
s
the
king
of
this
country
you
what
an
awful
yes
it
is
rather
unpleasant
isn
t
it
and
then
he
s
a
drove
the
last
king
out
and
made
himself
king
instead
he
used
to
be
a
cat
man
but
he
got
up
an
army
and
drove
the
other
off
the
throne
and
now
turned
into
a
name
s
oh
never
mind
what
his
name
is
only
get
me
m
awfully
hungry
for
you
see
i
ve
been
up
here
all
oh
all
right
but
i
say
how
are
you
going
to
get
can
t
climb
can
you
i
don
t
know
she
answered
i
ve
never
then
you
can
be
sure
you
can
t
the
only
thing
seems
to
be
for
me
to
carry
you
but
the
princess
did
not
seem
to
relish
the
idea
at
all
you
might
let
me
drop
you
know
it
s
rather
and
it
was
pretty
steep
as
steep
as
the
wall
of
a
house
and
a
good
deal
higher
than
a
very
high
house
however
it
seemed
to
be
the
only
thing
to
do
so
she
let
herself
be
carried
down
the
man
took
her
on
one
arm
and
yet
seemed
to
climb
down
about
as
easily
as
if
he
were
going
downstairs
however
the
princess
did
not
notice
that
since
she
kept
her
eyes
shut
hard
for
to
tell
the
truth
she
was
rather
nervous
but
at
last
they
were
at
the
bottom
and
he
let
her
down
on
to
the
ground
now
what
are
you
going
to
do
he
said
i
don
t
know
at
all
what
can
i
do
you
d
better
go
and
see
king
mumkie
and
ask
him
what
to
but
he
has
got
such
a
dreadful
name
it
sounds
as
if
he
was
awfully
ugly
she
said
but
he
s
not
at
all
he
s
just
like
me
and
i
m
sure
i
m
handsome
enough
for
any
the
princess
looked
at
him
now
for
the
first
time
for
you
see
she
had
not
noticed
him
very
much
while
she
was
on
the
mountain
but
now
she
could
hardly
repress
a
shudder
for
he
was
awfully
ugly
to
begin
with
he
was
big
enough
for
any
giant
and
then
his
hair
was
of
a
purple
hue
and
his
eyes
of
a
delicate
that
flashed
in
the
shade
like
a
cat
s
and
then
his
nose
was
awfully
red
and
shaped
like
a
and
his
teeth
which
were
long
and
bright
green
shone
in
the
sun
like
altogether
he
was
not
prepossessing
and
the
princess
could
hardly
help
smiling
when
he
said
that
the
king
was
as
handsome
as
himself
however
he
went
on
my
name
s
wopole
i
m
king
mumkie
s
falconer
and
so
i
can
tell
you
all
about
him
come
let
s
go
towards
the
and
as
there
seemed
nothing
else
to
do
she
set
out
with
him
but
he
walked
so
fast
that
she
could
hardly
keep
up
how
slowly
you
do
walk
he
grumbled
in
a
manner
can
t
you
keep
up
come
along
i
can
t
wait
all
and
he
went
on
faster
than
ever
so
that
she
had
to
run
to
keep
up
with
him
suddenly
he
stopped
as
if
he
had
been
shot
confound
it
i
ve
forgotten
to
bring
the
eagle
and
i
shall
have
to
go
all
the
way
back
and
get
it
and
he
began
to
howl
in
such
a
dreadful
manner
that
the
princess
felt
quite
relieved
when
he
turned
and
ran
towards
the
hill
at
the
top
of
his
speed
howling
all
the
way
what
on
earth
shall
i
do
now
thought
the
princess
if
i
wait
for
this
dreadful
giant
goodness
knows
what
may
happen
and
then
his
king
has
such
an
unpleasant
name
at
any
rate
i
should
like
some
breakfast
for
i
m
awfully
hungry
i
think
i
ll
go
on
towards
the
town
and
see
if
i
can
t
find
some
one
who
ll
show
me
the
way
so
she
went
on
down
the
lane
for
some
way
until
coming
to
a
place
where
a
stream
went
across
the
path
she
knelt
down
and
scooped
up
a
little
water
in
the
palm
of
her
hand
and
drank
it
for
you
see
the
sun
was
very
hot
now
and
the
heat
made
her
throat
feel
quite
dry
and
parched
when
she
had
finished
she
went
and
lay
down
in
the
long
grass
that
bordered
the
road
for
she
was
rather
tired
she
intended
to
wait
till
some
one
came
along
only
she
was
quite
resolved
not
to
go
with
the
giant
at
any
rate
so
she
lay
quietly
in
the
shade
listening
to
the
loud
humming
of
the
bees
and
the
chirp
of
a
linnet
that
was
pluming
itself
swinging
on
a
bough
above
her
head
she
had
not
been
waiting
long
before
she
heard
a
dreadful
noise
behind
her
coming
down
the
road
and
in
a
few
minutes
she
recognised
the
voice
of
the
giant
who
seemed
to
be
in
a
terrible
temper
gradually
the
sound
of
his
voice
and
his
footsteps
came
nearer
the
princess
did
not
know
what
to
do
for
if
she
tried
to
run
away
he
would
only
catch
her
up
so
she
lay
perfectly
still
hoping
he
would
pass
her
without
seeing
her
and
that
is
just
what
did
happen
for
in
a
few
moments
he
came
rushing
round
the
corner
shouting
out
stop
stop
will
you
and
as
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
road
far
in
advance
of
course
he
did
not
notice
her
and
was
soon
round
another
bend
in
the
road
the
princess
noticed
that
he
had
the
eagle
hanging
with
its
claws
round
his
neck
and
the
jolting
as
he
went
by
had
shaken
one
of
its
large
tail
feathers
out
and
as
soon
as
she
had
got
over
her
fright
she
went
and
picked
it
up
out
of
the
dusty
road
just
as
she
picked
it
up
the
clatter
of
feet
running
along
the
road
came
to
her
ears
and
for
a
moment
she
feared
that
the
giant
had
returned
but
soon
a
cow
trotted
round
the
bend
and
stopped
at
the
stream
to
drink
presently
another
and
then
a
third
each
of
them
took
a
long
look
at
the
princess
and
then
bent
down
its
head
to
take
a
draught
out
of
the
stream
just
then
an
old
man
came
round
the
corner
and
when
he
saw
the
cows
had
stopped
he
called
out
gee
on
lightfoot
now
daisy
come
up
cherry
and
the
cows
gave
their
heads
a
toss
and
walked
slowly
through
the
stream
the
princess
hurried
to
one
side
of
the
road
for
like
many
people
she
had
an
instinctive
dread
of
anything
like
a
cow
or
a
bull
the
old
man
noticed
it
and
smiled
oh
you
needn
t
be
afraid
miss
they
won
t
hurt
you
he
said
but
all
the
same
she
didn
t
care
to
go
too
near
them
they
ve
just
been
frightened
by
wopole
king
mumkie
s
falconer
he
went
on
wopole
came
running
round
the
corner
suddenly
and
almost
knocked
s
the
dun
he
was
roaring
out
where
is
she
awfully
loud
i
pity
her
when
he
gets
her
whoever
she
but
who
is
asked
the
princess
i
don
t
should
i
oh
i
only
thought
you
might
know
but
what
will
he
do
with
her
when
he
gets
her
i
don
t
know
fry
her
in
lard
or
s
what
they
generally
do
to
strangers
in
the
town
oh
dear
said
the
princess
how
am
i
to
get
away
from
him
the
old
man
looked
at
her
curiously
oh
you
re
her
he
said
i
rather
think
i
am
but
how
am
i
to
get
away
she
answered
if
you
ll
come
with
me
i
ll
take
you
to
my
cottage
over
there
and
they
ll
never
think
of
looking
for
you
but
the
princess
did
not
exactly
like
the
idea
aren
t
you
one
of
these
people
she
asked
because
i
don
t
relish
being
fried
in
lard
or
oil
or
anything
but
the
old
man
shook
his
head
good
gracious
me
no
he
said
i
wouldn
t
let
them
roast
the
last
stranger
that
came
to
the
town
and
so
they
turned
me
oh
said
the
princess
then
you
must
be
king
i
am
then
i
suppose
i
shall
be
safe
with
you
quite
safe
if
you
like
to
come
only
just
help
me
to
drive
the
and
the
old
man
called
to
his
animals
who
were
browsing
in
the
grass
at
the
wayside
and
they
trudged
quietly
on
till
they
came
to
a
gate
in
the
hedge
this
they
waited
for
the
old
man
to
open
for
them
and
then
went
through
the
meadow
until
they
came
to
a
little
farmhouse
half
hidden
by
trees
this
is
my
house
the
king
said
just
wait
a
moment
till
i
have
put
the
cows
in
the
byre
and
then
i
ll
come
back
and
let
you
in
for
you
see
my
wife
s
away
at
the
market
and
there
s
no
one
else
at
so
the
princess
stopped
where
she
was
and
the
old
man
went
whistling
round
to
the
back
of
the
house
driving
his
cows
before
him
it
was
a
very
small
house
with
the
thatched
roof
coming
so
low
down
that
you
could
touch
it
almost
with
your
hand
and
the
windows
were
quite
overshadowed
by
it
over
a
little
arbour
of
before
the
door
ran
a
of
deep
red
flowers
and
the
roses
were
full
of
bees
that
came
from
the
hives
arranged
on
benches
under
the
eaves
and
a
few
chickens
were
asleep
on
one
leg
under
the
porch
in
two
or
three
minutes
the
door
opened
and
the
old
man
appeared
and
the
chickens
walked
lazily
away
i
entered
by
a
back
door
he
explained
come
in
and
make
yourself
at
the
inside
of
the
house
was
just
as
small
and
homely
as
the
outside
and
the
rooms
were
refreshingly
shady
and
cool
after
the
hot
sunlight
without
sit
down
said
the
old
man
pointing
to
an
and
the
princess
did
as
she
was
told
now
said
he
if
you
will
tell
me
where
you
come
from
i
will
try
to
find
out
how
to
take
you
so
she
told
him
all
her
story
and
he
listened
very
attentively
when
she
had
finished
he
said
it
s
lucky
for
you
that
wopole
forgot
the
eagle
or
goodness
knows
what
would
have
happened
to
you
but
how
you
re
to
get
back
i
don
t
know
it
s
my
opinion
you
never
will
for
no
one
was
ever
known
to
pass
those
mountains
safely
i
don
t
know
what
else
he
would
have
gone
on
to
say
but
by
this
time
the
princess
had
begun
to
cry
bitterly
oh
dear
me
said
the
old
man
what
a
fool
i
was
to
go
and
tell
her
all
that
now
goodness
knows
what
ll
happen
oh
dear
oh
dear
princess
don
t
go
on
weeping
like
that
or
you
ll
melt
altogether
do
leave
but
the
princess
did
not
seem
at
all
inclined
to
leave
off
and
she
might
have
melted
altogether
only
just
then
the
door
opened
and
an
old
woman
with
a
on
her
arm
and
a
big
umbrella
in
her
hand
came
into
the
room
but
stood
transfixed
with
her
eyes
and
mouth
wide
open
when
she
saw
the
princess
my
abbonamento
what
s
the
little
girl
crying
for
and
where
does
she
come
from
and
what
does
it
all
mean
and
she
picked
up
her
umbrella
which
she
had
dropped
and
leaned
it
against
the
table
and
put
her
on
a
chair
this
she
did
very
slowly
and
all
the
while
the
old
king
was
telling
her
what
had
happened
so
that
by
the
time
she
had
finished
her
preparations
she
knew
nearly
as
much
about
it
as
he
did
when
he
had
finished
she
shook
her
head
poor
girl
poor
girl
so
you
come
from
the
land
on
the
other
side
of
the
mountains
i
know
the
princess
had
by
this
time
left
off
crying
and
when
she
heard
the
old
lady
say
i
know
it
she
said
kennst
du
das
land
wo
die
citronen
blühen
but
the
old
lady
shook
her
head
that
s
greek
and
i
never
could
understand
greek
if
it
had
been
german
or
french
just
translate
it
for
me
will
you
so
the
princess
translated
it
for
her
knowest
thou
the
land
where
blooms
the
but
the
old
lady
shook
her
head
i
don
t
know
so
much
about
the
but
my
thompson
had
a
sister
whose
daughter
had
a
servant
who
d
seen
the
dragon
eat
up
the
last
man
that
ever
tried
to
cross
the
but
i
don
t
see
how
that
is
to
help
me
to
get
you
no
i
don
t
exactly
but
perhaps
something
will
turn
up
to
help
you
won
t
it
abbonamento
abbonamento
nodded
but
what
shall
i
do
in
the
meanwhile
said
the
princess
for
you
see
i
don
t
want
to
be
fried
in
lard
as
you
say
the
townsmen
are
in
the
habit
of
you
d
better
stop
with
us
said
abbonamento
eh
wife
what
do
you
say
and
his
wife
said
oh
yes
certainly
it
s
the
only
thing
to
do
do
well
i
suppose
i
must
said
the
princess
only
shan
t
i
be
rather
in
the
way
but
the
king
answered
oh
not
at
all
quite
the
other
way
you
ll
be
very
useful
you
can
milk
the
cows
and
pluck
the
fowls
and
feed
the
pigs
and
all
sorts
of
but
what
will
the
people
of
the
town
say
if
they
see
me
asked
the
princess
the
people
of
the
they
never
come
near
me
although
they
are
glad
to
buy
butter
and
milk
and
eggs
of
me
in
the
market
they
think
it
seems
grand
to
say
they
buy
their
things
of
a
king
but
they
never
trouble
about
me
at
all
except
for
just
at
this
moment
the
old
lady
thinking
it
her
turn
to
say
something
said
by
the
bye
you
have
not
told
us
your
name
would
you
like
it
in
full
or
only
what
i
m
generally
called
asked
the
princess
oh
say
it
in
full
unless
you
ve
any
well
you
see
it
s
rather
long
it
generally
takes
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
say
only
if
you
want
it
particularly
i
ll
tell
but
the
queen
answered
ah
well
perhaps
we
ll
wait
for
a
time
until
we
ve
got
leisure
to
listen
to
it
meanwhile
you
might
tell
us
what
the
short
of
it
they
generally
call
me
the
princess
ernalie
now
you
might
tell
me
your
name
if
you
don
t
they
generally
call
me
queen
araminta
if
you
like
and
are
not
too
tired
i
ll
show
you
the
farm
and
then
we
ll
have
so
the
princess
went
through
the
yard
to
the
cows
byre
and
from
the
stalls
to
the
and
from
the
sties
to
the
and
thence
to
the
orchard
and
from
the
orchard
to
the
and
after
that
home
again
so
it
was
arranged
that
the
princess
ernalie
was
to
stop
with
the
king
and
queen
until
something
should
turn
up
but
nothing
ever
did
turn
up
and
the
days
lengthened
into
months
and
the
months
into
years
and
still
she
stayed
with
the
old
couple
and
as
time
went
on
she
seemed
to
do
almost
all
the
work
of
the
farm
for
the
old
king
and
queen
were
beginning
to
get
too
old
and
weak
for
hard
work
and
gradually
she
began
to
forget
about
her
native
land
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
farm
were
to
be
her
home
for
ever
and
every
year
she
grew
taller
and
more
beautiful
but
that
s
a
habit
that
princesses
have
pretty
often
so
five
years
passed
quietly
away
and
nothing
seemed
likely
to
disturb
the
peace
of
the
household
every
morning
regularly
she
got
up
at
five
o
clock
to
drive
the
cows
to
the
pasture
and
then
she
fed
the
poultry
and
if
it
happened
to
be
a
thursday
or
saturday
she
went
with
the
queen
to
take
the
butter
and
eggs
to
market
besides
which
she
had
to
milk
the
cows
and
cook
the
dinner
and
all
sorts
of
things
so
that
she
was
gradually
turning
into
a
simple
country
maid
during
all
the
five
years
no
one
from
the
town
ever
came
near
the
house
and
so
you
may
imagine
how
surprised
she
was
one
morning
when
she
got
up
and
opened
her
bedroom
window
to
see
a
man
coming
across
the
towards
the
house
she
watched
him
come
right
up
to
the
door
and
then
when
she
heard
him
knock
ran
down
to
tell
the
king
and
queen
that
a
man
was
knocking
at
the
door
who
on
earth
can
it
be
asked
abbonamento
it
s
not
the
is
it
asked
araminta
oh
no
it
s
not
him
he
s
an
old
man
and
this
one
is
quite
young
answered
the
princess
nor
the
no
it
s
not
him
either
there
he
is
knocking
indeed
the
knocking
was
becoming
quite
furious
he
s
a
very
impatient
young
man
whoever
he
is
said
abbonamento
you
d
better
go
and
tell
him
not
to
make
such
a
noise
let
him
quick
or
he
ll
knock
the
door
down
and
it
seemed
so
likely
that
ernalie
ran
down
as
fast
as
she
could
and
opened
the
door
why
can
t
you
open
the
door
faster
said
an
angry
voice
and
then
ernalie
saw
a
young
man
looking
at
her
in
a
state
of
great
surprise
why
who
are
you
he
asked
is
this
not
the
house
of
their
majesties
king
abbonamento
and
queen
araminta
they
used
to
be
king
and
queen
at
one
time
answered
ernalie
they
ought
to
be
now
said
the
young
man
with
a
frown
that
s
quite
another
thing
retorted
ernalie
oh
is
it
said
he
with
a
smile
this
time
but
who
on
earth
are
you
if
i
may
ask
i
am
her
royal
highness
princess
ernalie
of
aoland
and
who
on
earth
are
you
if
i
may
ask
i
am
prince
treblo
of
this
country
answered
he
i
suppose
you
are
the
son
of
king
mumkie
then
said
she
good
gracious
no
said
the
prince
the
princess
was
just
about
to
say
then
whose
son
are
you
when
the
old
king
burst
into
the
room
he
had
evidently
got
up
in
a
hurry
and
he
was
only
attired
in
his
flowered
my
he
exclaimed
as
he
threw
himself
into
the
stranger
s
arms
araminta
araminta
come
along
it
s
and
the
queen
came
rushing
down
in
haste
as
you
may
imagine
over
the
rest
of
this
affecting
scene
we
will
draw
a
s
what
they
generally
do
with
affecting
books
at
least
the
princess
ernalie
easily
perceived
that
she
was
a
the
french
that
is
finding
that
three
was
company
and
four
so
she
left
the
room
and
went
upstairs
to
comb
her
hair
and
wash
her
face
and
hands
and
make
herself
look
smart
generally
for
she
thought
that
would
be
only
right
on
the
day
on
which
the
eldest
son
of
the
house
came
as
he
was
very
handsome
now
it
happened
that
as
she
was
bending
down
to
pick
up
her
best
shoes
from
under
her
one
of
them
had
gone
a
little
far
back
and
as
she
drew
it
out
she
noticed
that
something
lay
behind
the
shoe
and
she
drew
that
out
too
you
may
perhaps
remember
that
she
had
picked
up
out
of
the
road
an
eagle
s
feather
which
wopole
had
let
fall
as
he
hurried
by
with
the
eagle
on
his
back
well
then
it
was
this
feather
that
she
now
drew
out
from
under
the
it
had
lain
there
since
she
had
first
entered
the
room
five
years
ago
now
this
doesn
t
say
much
for
the
cleanliness
of
the
floors
but
in
those
unsophisticated
days
they
never
thought
of
sweeping
any
hidden
spot
in
the
floor
this
habit
curiously
enough
survives
even
now
among
some
people
however
to
return
to
the
princess
ernalie
when
she
picked
up
the
feather
she
stood
upright
again
and
examined
it
carefully
why
how
nice
she
said
it
s
the
old
eagle
s
feather
now
that
ll
come
in
handy
my
hat
rather
wanted
a
new
feather
and
it
ll
just
suit
the
colour
of
my
hair
and
so
she
went
to
the
and
held
the
feather
close
against
her
hair
but
to
her
astonishment
nothing
was
to
be
seen
in
the
a
vestige
of
herself
it
seemed
as
if
she
had
vanished
altogether
why
what
s
the
matter
with
the
glass
she
said
something
seems
to
have
gone
wrong
with
so
she
put
the
feather
on
the
table
and
went
to
rub
the
glass
but
when
she
looked
at
it
she
was
there
all
right
again
that
s
queer
she
thought
i
can
t
have
been
right
in
front
of
the
so
she
took
up
the
feather
and
went
in
front
of
the
glass
this
time
she
saw
herself
very
well
but
as
soon
as
the
feather
touched
her
hair
she
vanished
just
as
before
good
gracious
she
said
what
is
the
matter
with
the
glass
so
she
tried
again
and
the
result
was
always
the
the
feather
touched
her
hair
she
vanished
it
must
be
something
the
matter
with
the
so
she
examined
it
quite
closely
and
she
found
rolled
round
the
quill
end
of
it
a
small
piece
of
paper
on
which
was
written
guard
well
the
feather
for
whoso
toucheth
his
hair
he
be
but
be
invisible
yet
shall
he
see
ernalie
read
it
over
once
or
twice
from
beginning
to
end
the
writing
says
his
hair
but
it
seems
to
act
just
as
well
with
her
is
my
hair
what
fun
i
shall
have
now
i
think
i
ll
try
it
on
at
once
on
the
king
but
then
it
might
frighten
him
no
i
ll
wait
and
try
it
on
treblo
and
that
reminds
me
i
think
that
they
ve
had
enough
of
it
all
to
themselves
now
i
ll
go
and
see
if
i
can
do
anything
for
so
she
locked
the
feather
up
in
one
of
the
drawers
and
then
putting
on
her
shoes
went
downstairs
now
it
happened
that
just
as
she
had
almost
reached
the
bottom
step
her
heel
came
out
of
her
shoe
and
as
she
stopped
to
put
it
firmly
on
again
she
heard
the
voice
of
the
stranger
saying
by
the
bye
mother
who
was
that
girl
who
opened
the
door
to
me
oh
that
s
ernalie
answered
the
queen
s
voice
it
seemed
as
if
the
shoe
took
some
time
to
get
on
again
so
she
told
me
but
who
is
ernalie
he
asked
again
oh
you
d
better
get
her
to
tell
you
that
too
when
she
comes
down
well
what
do
you
think
of
her
oh
she
s
just
lovely
answered
he
listeners
never
hear
any
good
of
themselves
thought
the
princess
however
the
shoe
had
come
on
just
at
that
moment
and
she
entered
the
room
speak
of
the
king
was
just
saying
when
the
prince
interrupted
him
speak
of
angels
and
you
hear
the
rustling
of
their
wings
you
mean
he
said
thank
you
for
the
compliment
if
it
was
meant
for
me
said
the
princess
oh
don
t
mention
s
nothing
when
you
re
used
to
it
said
treblo
who
to
tell
the
truth
seemed
rather
confused
and
are
you
used
to
calling
young
ladies
angels
said
his
father
sharply
i
suppose
it
s
some
of
the
foreign
manners
you
ve
suppose
we
change
the
subject
retorted
his
son
and
the
subject
was
changed
ernalie
retired
again
she
wanted
to
look
after
the
dinner
so
that
it
might
not
be
late
and
so
nothing
else
in
particular
happened
for
treblo
went
round
the
farm
with
his
father
and
araminta
went
into
the
kitchen
to
help
ernalie
with
the
dinner
when
the
goose
was
turning
on
the
spit
and
the
had
been
put
into
the
oven
the
princess
had
time
to
ask
some
questions
about
treblo
and
the
queen
told
her
that
he
had
been
sent
out
of
the
way
by
mumkie
in
order
that
he
might
not
attempt
to
put
his
father
on
the
throne
again
but
after
seven
years
he
had
come
back
safe
having
had
all
sorts
of
adventures
and
he
now
felt
quite
confident
that
he
would
be
able
to
restore
his
father
for
he
was
very
popular
with
the
army
that
had
just
returned
from
the
war
and
as
to
the
people
of
the
town
they
cared
very
little
who
was
fact
they
rather
preferred
abbonamento
to
mumkie
so
araminta
was
quite
cheerful
over
it
for
she
much
preferred
living
in
a
palace
to
living
in
a
cottage
things
went
merrily
through
the
day
and
at
they
drank
the
health
of
the
king
and
queen
of
the
country
and
altogether
they
seemed
very
happy
after
dinner
the
king
composed
himself
for
his
afternoon
nap
and
the
queen
took
down
a
volume
of
sermons
and
began
to
read
ernalie
went
out
to
milk
the
cows
and
take
the
eggs
from
the
hens
nests
as
to
the
prince
he
said
he
was
going
out
to
take
a
walk
before
going
out
the
princess
slipped
up
to
her
room
and
took
the
eagle
s
feather
from
the
drawer
where
she
had
locked
it
up
she
intended
to
try
if
she
were
invisible
to
the
cows
and
poultry
so
she
put
it
in
her
sunbonnet
and
went
out
it
really
seemed
as
if
it
was
quite
correct
about
the
feather
for
as
soon
as
she
got
out
of
the
door
a
bee
ran
right
against
her
and
then
a
sparrow
that
was
chirping
on
a
rail
allowed
her
to
catch
hold
of
it
before
it
took
any
notice
of
her
approach
however
she
let
it
go
and
it
flew
away
looking
very
astonished
indeed
as
you
may
imagine
she
reached
the
pasture
and
opened
the
gate
calling
to
the
cows
daisy
daisy
come
lightfoot
cherry
come
the
cows
looked
up
from
the
ground
and
came
towards
the
gate
looking
very
astonished
indeed
but
when
they
got
quite
close
and
saw
no
one
they
stopped
and
however
much
she
called
them
they
refused
to
move
this
will
never
do
she
said
i
must
really
let
them
see
me
or
they
won
t
so
she
took
the
feather
from
her
bonnet
and
called
again
this
time
the
cows
seemed
quite
ready
to
come
and
they
trotted
along
to
the
gate
and
crowded
round
her
to
be
stroked
so
she
shut
the
gate
again
and
told
the
cows
to
go
they
understood
her
quite
then
she
went
on
after
them
when
they
got
to
the
dairy
she
milked
them
one
after
the
other
as
they
came
in
their
regular
order
to
the
stool
she
was
milking
the
last
the
best
of
them
she
leaned
her
face
against
its
side
and
listened
to
the
thud
thud
of
the
milk
as
it
streamed
into
the
pail
with
a
foam
like
the
sea
in
a
rage
she
was
in
fact
almost
lulled
to
sleep
by
it
when
she
was
startled
by
a
voice
behind
her
it
was
so
sudden
that
she
almost
upset
the
in
her
fright
it
seems
to
be
easy
work
milking
said
the
voice
and
she
looked
round
and
saw
it
was
the
prince
who
had
come
quietly
up
behind
and
was
leaning
over
the
fence
at
her
back
looking
on
lazily
at
her
oh
how
you
startled
me
prince
she
said
did
i
he
answered
i
am
very
sorry
for
that
but
you
needn
t
call
me
prince
yet
i
m
not
a
prince
you
see
and
then
you
re
the
adopted
daughter
of
my
parents
so
you
ought
to
call
me
your
oh
really
said
she
however
you
soon
will
be
a
prince
and
then
i
shan
t
be
able
to
call
you
brother
shall
i
why
not
because
you
will
be
a
prince
and
i
am
only
a
but
you
re
a
princess
aren
t
you
he
asked
i
was
a
princess
once
she
said
with
a
sigh
you
shall
be
again
he
said
but
how
do
you
know
she
asked
i
well
let
s
change
the
subject
as
i
said
before
it
seems
to
be
easy
work
milking
you
might
let
me
try
but
she
said
it
wouldn
t
be
any
good
cherry
wouldn
t
let
any
one
but
me
touch
her
besides
i
ve
just
done
and
i
m
going
to
carry
the
pails
to
the
let
me
carry
them
for
you
he
said
quickly
oh
thanks
if
you
ll
take
two
i
ll
take
the
other
two
and
thus
we
shall
do
it
all
in
one
journey
she
answered
so
he
did
as
he
was
told
and
the
pails
were
put
safely
in
the
house
now
i
must
go
and
get
the
eggs
she
said
can
i
be
of
any
use
asked
the
prince
but
she
answered
oh
no
there
s
nothing
for
you
to
do
but
he
went
with
her
all
the
same
i
suppose
he
thought
he
might
be
of
some
use
so
she
let
him
hold
the
basket
for
her
and
the
eggs
were
also
put
safely
in
the
house
just
however
as
he
had
put
them
down
a
shrill
whistle
sounded
twice
from
behind
the
garden
hedge
and
the
prince
said
oh
that
s
a
friend
of
mine
you
must
excuse
me
for
a
few
moments
and
he
went
towards
the
hedge
i
wonder
who
his
friend
is
she
said
to
herself
i
think
i
ll
put
the
feather
on
again
and
go
after
them
it
would
be
a
good
way
of
trying
my
feather
on
so
she
took
the
feather
out
of
her
pocket
again
and
put
it
in
her
bonnet
and
then
ran
after
him
he
had
got
over
the
fence
some
time
before
she
reached
it
but
he
was
still
in
sight
on
the
other
side
and
with
him
his
friend
was
walking
he
seemed
to
be
a
soldier
so
far
as
she
knew
they
were
talking
very
earnestly
but
from
where
she
was
she
was
not
able
to
hear
what
they
said
so
she
too
got
over
the
fence
and
went
towards
them
but
she
reached
them
rather
too
late
to
hear
anything
much
that
they
did
say
what
she
did
hear
was
this
from
the
soldier
then
you
will
come
at
twelve
yes
answered
the
prince
we
ll
have
everything
ready
and
it
will
be
easily
done
if
i
were
you
i
wouldn
t
tell
the
king
or
queen
it
would
only
make
them
nervous
and
we
re
sure
to
very
well
said
treblo
at
twelve
thought
the
princess
what
on
earth
is
he
going
to
do
at
that
time
of
night
it
sounds
funny
i
think
i
ll
go
with
him
to
look
after
for
you
see
ernalie
was
rather
inquisitive
as
you
may
have
found
out
by
this
time
so
the
soldier
went
one
way
and
treblo
went
back
to
the
house
whistling
when
the
king
shall
enjoy
his
own
but
the
princess
ran
on
in
front
of
him
and
reached
the
house
first
so
that
by
the
time
he
was
there
she
had
taken
the
feather
out
of
her
bonnet
and
was
quite
visible
again
he
came
in
quite
naturally
as
if
nothing
had
happened
and
the
rest
of
the
day
went
off
quietly
enough
they
went
very
early
to
bed
at
the
farm
and
the
house
was
quiet
by
eight
just
before
they
went
to
bed
ernalie
asked
the
prince
do
you
like
walking
at
night
much
it
depends
upon
the
night
very
much
he
answered
such
a
night
as
this
for
instance
said
she
oh
a
moonlight
night
for
a
ramble
don
t
you
know
he
said
laughing
about
twelve
i
the
prince
looked
astonished
and
shocked
twelve
he
said
with
his
eyes
wide
open
why
i
m
never
out
after
eight
my
mother
says
the
night
air
s
not
good
for
oh
is
that
it
said
the
princess
however
i
m
tired
and
she
went
to
her
room
and
lay
down
on
her
bed
with
all
her
clothes
on
it
was
rather
hard
work
keeping
awake
for
such
a
time
but
at
last
she
heard
the
kitchen
clock
strike
twelve
and
she
knew
it
was
twenty
past
so
she
got
up
as
quietly
as
possible
and
put
on
the
feather
for
you
see
she
didn
t
want
any
one
to
see
her
it
seemed
very
ghostly
getting
up
so
late
at
night
and
although
she
stepped
very
lightly
the
stairs
creaked
loudly
she
went
into
the
and
sat
on
a
chair
waiting
for
the
prince
to
come
down
she
had
to
wait
close
on
half
an
hour
for
you
see
the
prince
had
heard
the
clock
strike
too
but
didn
t
know
it
was
twenty
minutes
slow
however
at
last
he
came
downstairs
holding
the
candle
in
his
hand
he
hadn
t
put
his
boots
on
for
fear
of
waking
any
one
and
so
he
too
sat
down
on
a
chair
to
put
them
on
this
was
rather
unpleasant
for
the
princess
for
of
course
she
had
to
keep
as
quiet
as
a
mouse
for
fear
of
making
him
suspicious
for
you
see
it
was
so
quiet
that
the
least
breath
she
took
could
be
heard
at
last
the
putting
on
of
his
boots
was
finished
and
he
stood
up
saying
to
himself
out
loud
now
where
s
my
hat
and
then
he
looked
straight
at
the
princess
and
said
ah
there
it
is
and
he
began
to
walk
towards
her
what
can
he
want
thought
the
princess
and
then
she
looked
down
at
the
you
see
she
could
see
right
through
she
discovered
she
was
sitting
on
his
hat
by
this
time
he
was
quite
close
to
her
and
bending
down
to
pick
his
hat
up
so
she
jumped
sideways
off
the
chair
as
fast
as
she
could
but
even
then
as
he
put
his
hand
out
he
caught
hold
of
hers
which
had
not
time
to
get
out
of
the
way
as
soon
as
his
hand
closed
on
it
however
he
let
go
as
if
it
had
stung
him
good
gracious
what
is
that
he
said
in
astonishment
and
he
did
look
so
funny
that
she
had
hard
work
to
keep
from
laughing
at
him
however
he
calmed
down
in
a
minute
and
again
tried
to
take
up
his
hat
this
time
you
may
be
sure
that
the
princess
s
hand
was
no
longer
there
for
she
had
taken
herself
and
it
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
table
so
he
took
up
the
hat
and
looked
at
it
looks
as
if
it
had
been
sat
on
he
muttered
just
like
em
people
always
do
sit
on
my
hat
if
they
however
he
pushed
it
out
straight
again
and
looked
at
his
boots
to
see
if
the
laces
were
quite
tight
and
then
he
blew
the
light
out
seeming
by
the
noise
he
was
making
to
be
trying
to
get
out
of
the
door
when
she
heard
him
in
the
passage
she
thought
it
was
about
time
to
follow
him
so
she
tried
to
do
it
making
as
little
noise
as
possible
but
although
she
did
try
very
hard
she
did
not
succeed
very
well
for
she
fell
right
over
a
chair
and
made
noise
enough
to
be
heard
all
over
the
house
what
on
earth
s
that
she
heard
the
prince
ask
and
then
he
lit
a
match
to
look
but
he
didn
t
see
anything
and
the
light
allowed
the
princess
to
get
quite
close
to
him
without
upsetting
anything
more
and
he
opened
the
door
letting
the
moonlight
shine
in
clear
and
white
while
he
was
standing
at
the
door
she
managed
to
slip
past
him
into
the
open
air
and
there
she
waited
for
him
he
wasn
t
very
long
coming
and
then
she
followed
him
down
the
garden
keeping
to
the
grassy
edge
and
not
walking
on
the
path
for
fear
of
the
noise
that
her
feet
would
make
on
the
gravel
they
reached
the
field
and
then
the
road
and
the
prince
was
joined
by
the
other
man
whom
the
princess
had
seen
before
this
by
the
bye
the
prince
called
dressed
in
complete
armour
and
he
carried
another
suit
which
the
prince
proceeded
to
put
on
this
begins
to
look
exciting
thought
ernalie
perhaps
he
s
a
highwayman
or
a
i
mean
to
keep
up
with
so
she
walked
on
faster
for
she
had
fallen
a
little
behind
when
she
got
up
with
them
she
heard
the
prince
say
well
we
ll
surround
the
palace
take
mumkie
prisoner
and
turn
him
into
the
and
then
we
ll
proclaim
it
to
the
rest
of
the
citizens
that
my
father
and
mother
are
king
and
queen
once
more
and
if
they
won
t
give
much
the
worse
for
them
the
soldiers
are
all
on
my
the
other
answered
oh
but
they
ll
give
in
without
the
soldiers
they
re
not
at
all
fond
of
mumkie
he
has
made
himself
very
unpopular
of
late
you
see
he
put
a
farthing
on
the
income
tax
and
he
s
raised
the
price
of
everything
that
begins
with
s
like
sausages
and
and
soap
and
now
your
father
only
raised
the
price
of
things
that
begin
with
z
and
there
aren
t
many
z
s
you
know
there
s
zebras
and
zeal
and
you
can
t
make
much
out
of
selling
ah
that
s
what
you
re
up
to
thought
the
princess
we
ought
to
have
some
fun
however
they
were
walking
too
fast
for
her
to
think
much
all
she
could
do
was
to
keep
up
and
that
she
did
to
the
best
of
her
power
until
at
last
they
reached
the
middle
of
the
town
where
the
king
s
palace
stood
here
they
halted
to
take
counsel
you
wait
here
while
i
go
and
fetch
the
men
said
ablot
and
as
the
prince
made
no
objection
he
went
and
left
him
standing
in
the
moonlit
square
as
ablot
seemed
gone
rather
a
long
time
the
princess
thought
she
would
have
a
little
fun
and
going
close
to
the
prince
she
whispered
in
his
ear
does
your
mother
know
you
re
out
the
prince
turned
round
once
or
twice
as
if
to
assure
himself
that
there
was
no
one
hiding
behind
his
back
but
as
he
could
see
no
one
he
simply
said
i
beg
your
that
s
very
good
of
you
but
i
thought
you
were
never
allowed
out
after
eight
o
clock
i
heard
you
tell
ernalie
so
this
evening
i
m
afraid
you
told
a
the
prince
looked
very
astonished
who
or
what
are
you
he
asked
never
you
mind
i
ve
a
good
mind
not
to
let
you
succeed
this
evening
because
you
deceive
not
only
your
old
mother
who
is
asleep
at
home
but
you
have
also
told
a
fib
to
that
innocent
girl
of
whom
i
m
very
that
s
quite
true
thought
the
princess
i
m
very
fond
of
and
so
she
was
the
prince
looked
astonished
how
on
earth
could
you
know
that
he
said
i
heard
it
i
tell
but
there
was
no
one
in
the
room
except
the
princess
and
all
the
same
i
heard
every
word
you
said
and
what
s
more
i
shall
hear
every
word
you
ever
say
to
her
answered
the
princess
well
then
you
ll
be
a
great
nuisance
said
the
prince
angrily
very
well
i
ll
tell
the
princess
all
that
you
say
and
i
ve
a
good
mind
not
to
let
you
succeed
as
i
ve
said
then
you
ll
do
the
princess
a
great
deal
of
harm
if
you
why
because
she
he
began
she
s
what
asked
the
voice
oh
well
never
but
i
do
mind
said
the
voice
she
s
all
that
fancy
painted
if
you
want
to
know
so
much
said
the
prince
but
i
don
t
see
how
that
ll
make
any
difference
to
her
in
case
you
should
succeed
said
the
voice
you
re
uncommonly
dull
if
you
don
t
see
it
said
the
prince
who
was
beginning
to
feel
over
being
thus
don
t
be
rude
or
you
shan
t
succeed
said
the
voice
if
i
don
t
succeed
the
princess
will
never
become
queen
of
the
how
can
she
become
queen
of
the
would
have
to
be
a
and
i
don
t
see
if
you
do
succeed
how
she
is
to
become
queen
as
i
ve
said
before
said
the
prince
you
re
excessively
dull
if
you
don
t
i
shall
tell
her
what
you
oh
do
anything
you
like
only
leave
me
alone
do
said
the
prince
who
by
this
time
was
quite
in
a
temper
so
she
let
him
alone
and
made
no
answer
when
he
wanted
her
to
talk
again
however
in
a
few
minutes
ablot
came
into
the
square
followed
by
a
large
number
of
men
whom
she
heard
him
command
to
surround
the
palace
which
they
accordingly
did
and
then
choosing
five
men
he
and
the
prince
entered
the
palace
ernalie
following
them
for
she
didn
t
know
exactly
what
else
to
do
the
first
of
the
palace
guards
they
came
to
was
fast
asleep
and
they
did
not
molest
him
but
the
second
one
was
awake
and
so
was
the
third
one
these
two
made
some
resistance
but
they
were
soon
knocked
down
and
bound
but
that
was
not
much
good
for
they
made
such
a
noise
that
they
would
soon
have
brought
the
household
about
their
ears
only
it
happened
to
be
saturday
and
all
the
servants
were
having
a
half
holiday
and
the
only
effect
of
the
shouting
was
to
bring
king
mumkie
out
on
to
the
landing
he
had
been
sitting
up
to
let
the
servants
in
when
they
came
home
and
he
was
in
rather
a
bad
temper
what
the
deuce
are
you
making
such
a
noise
for
he
shouted
to
the
guards
but
as
the
guards
had
been
gagged
by
this
time
they
could
only
gurgle
hopelessly
why
don
t
you
answer
roared
the
king
but
the
guards
made
no
reply
and
the
king
came
running
down
to
see
what
was
the
matter
he
was
holding
a
candlestick
above
his
head
and
the
light
that
fell
on
his
face
showed
that
he
was
in
a
very
great
rage
indeed
when
he
saw
the
prince
in
the
hall
he
stopped
and
said
what
do
you
want
making
this
unearthly
row
at
this
time
of
night
every
one
s
in
bed
and
i
shall
catch
my
death
of
cold
coming
down
in
my
into
this
cold
hall
now
just
go
and
leave
me
i
shall
not
answered
the
prince
why
not
what
do
you
want
at
this
time
of
night
i
want
the
throne
then
you
can
t
have
it
it
s
a
reserved
seat
and
i
ve
taken
it
but
what
right
have
you
to
it
i
m
the
sovereign
said
mumkie
you
re
a
false
coin
re
not
a
sovereign
i
m
quite
as
good
as
the
last
sovereign
he
s
lost
the
crown
so
he
s
only
worth
fifteen
well
fifteen
shillings
is
three
crowns
and
you
haven
t
got
yes
i
well
then
you
won
t
have
it
i
shall
have
it
to
the
end
of
my
not
if
i
can
help
it
retorted
the
prince
but
you
can
t
help
why
not
pray
well
you
can
t
unless
you
scalp
me
s
the
crown
of
my
head
i
well
then
i
ll
have
your
head
cut
i
shall
die
then
so
i
shall
keep
the
crown
until
i
die
besides
i
shall
have
your
head
cut
off
instead
for
i
ll
call
out
the
that
s
no
good
they
re
all
on
my
side
answered
the
prince
then
it
s
all
up
with
me
as
julius
cæsar
s
see
what
did
he
say
now
yes
and
he
began
to
roar
a
horse
a
horse
my
kingdom
for
a
horse
you
ll
make
hoarse
if
you
go
on
roaring
like
that
besides
your
share
of
the
kingdom
isn
t
worth
a
s
not
even
worth
a
that
s
rather
old
said
the
king
however
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
me
i
m
going
to
turn
you
into
what
you
wanted
to
turn
my
father
into
you
shall
have
his
cottage
and
all
the
and
implements
thereto
what
does
that
mean
asked
the
astonished
mumkie
oh
find
out
said
the
prince
and
he
found
out
eventually
the
prince
now
gave
orders
that
he
should
be
taken
to
the
and
locked
in
there
for
fear
of
escape
and
so
the
poor
old
man
was
led
off
muttering
to
himself
uneasy
lies
the
head
that
wears
a
but
the
prince
answered
well
you
needn
t
talk
your
head
doesn
t
wear
a
and
from
that
time
forth
it
didn
t
while
this
was
being
done
the
princess
had
noticed
that
a
man
had
been
stealing
round
the
corner
he
was
standing
close
beside
her
now
and
he
seemed
quite
unconscious
of
her
presence
the
princess
looked
at
him
he
must
be
one
of
the
five
they
brought
in
with
them
she
said
to
herself
so
she
counted
but
to
her
astonishment
she
found
there
were
six
of
him
he
must
be
some
one
belonging
to
the
palace
she
thought
and
he
may
be
up
to
some
so
she
watched
him
closely
it
was
evident
that
the
rest
thought
he
was
one
of
themselves
for
they
took
no
notice
of
him
in
particular
the
man
however
seemed
quite
innocent
but
the
princess
noticed
that
he
was
fingering
a
pistol
that
he
had
in
his
belt
in
a
most
suspicious
way
so
she
kept
quite
close
to
him
while
they
descended
the
stairs
to
the
cellars
and
she
was
right
for
in
the
twinkling
of
a
he
drew
the
pistol
from
his
belt
and
aimed
straight
towards
the
prince
but
before
he
could
draw
the
trigger
she
lifted
up
her
hand
and
gave
him
such
a
box
on
the
ear
that
in
his
astonishment
and
pain
he
dropped
the
pistol
altogether
and
it
exploded
harmlessly
as
for
the
man
he
was
so
astonished
that
he
sat
down
on
the
floor
with
his
mouth
and
eyes
wide
open
looking
like
an
expiring
frog
at
the
report
of
his
pistol
every
one
turned
and
ablot
noticed
him
for
the
first
time
why
who
are
you
he
said
but
the
man
only
gasped
who
is
he
asked
the
prince
of
the
men
we
thought
he
was
one
of
us
they
all
answered
in
astonishment
who
are
you
asked
the
prince
but
he
only
gasped
on
in
silence
stick
a
pin
into
him
and
see
if
that
will
bring
him
and
a
man
was
just
going
to
do
it
when
he
said
in
a
gruff
voice
don
t
i
m
oh
you
re
wopole
and
who
s
he
asked
the
prince
i
used
to
be
the
falconer
of
the
late
tyrant
now
sojourning
in
the
oh
and
so
you
tried
to
shoot
me
not
at
all
your
majesty
i
was
only
firing
a
royal
salute
to
show
my
joy
at
your
ascent
to
the
that
s
not
true
said
the
voice
of
the
princess
so
suddenly
that
every
one
started
and
the
falconer
collapsed
again
i
ve
a
good
mind
to
have
your
head
cut
off
said
the
prince
who
by
this
time
had
grown
used
to
the
voice
however
i
ll
just
put
you
in
the
along
with
your
late
wopole
having
been
accordingly
put
into
the
hole
everything
seemed
quiet
and
as
it
was
getting
late
the
princess
thought
she
would
leave
them
she
therefore
returned
as
fast
as
she
could
and
getting
into
bed
slept
soundly
till
morning
she
did
not
awake
until
long
after
her
usual
hour
for
you
see
she
was
not
used
to
being
out
so
late
and
she
was
only
roused
in
the
morning
by
the
queen
knocking
at
the
door
ernalie
ernalie
she
called
get
up
it
s
seven
you
ought
to
have
been
up
this
two
she
got
up
as
fast
as
she
could
and
when
she
had
laid
the
table
the
king
and
queen
came
down
i
wish
you
d
knock
at
treblo
s
door
and
tell
him
we
re
waiting
breakfast
for
him
the
queen
said
to
ernalie
and
she
accordingly
went
but
she
couldn
t
get
any
answer
and
she
went
downstairs
once
more
and
told
them
he
seemed
to
be
out
where
can
he
be
asked
the
king
i
rather
think
he
s
gone
out
for
a
walk
suggested
the
princess
it
s
funny
he
usedn
t
to
be
fond
of
getting
up
so
early
just
go
to
the
door
and
see
if
he
is
coming
across
the
ernalie
obediently
went
to
the
door
and
shading
her
eyes
from
the
glare
of
the
sun
looked
over
the
fields
towards
the
road
she
came
back
quickly
i
can
t
see
him
she
said
but
there
s
a
whole
lot
of
people
coming
across
the
the
king
looked
vexedly
astonished
what
on
earth
do
they
want
he
said
it
must
be
some
fresh
trick
of
mumkie
for
bothering
however
by
this
time
the
people
had
reached
the
garden
gate
and
they
could
hear
a
man
s
step
on
the
it
stopped
at
the
door
and
a
knock
was
heard
come
in
cried
the
king
and
the
man
entered
bowing
profoundly
when
the
king
saw
who
it
was
he
looked
surprised
and
said
why
lord
corax
what
do
you
want
with
me
i
have
come
to
receive
your
majesty
s
orders
said
the
man
in
a
singularly
hoarse
voice
the
king
looked
still
more
astonished
my
orders
what
you
mean
i
mean
your
majesty
s
orders
for
the
management
of
affairs
said
the
man
with
a
still
deeper
obeisance
a
light
broke
on
the
king
s
face
oh
that
s
what
you
mean
is
it
he
said
it
is
your
majesty
answered
the
courtier
bowing
once
more
it
strikes
me
you
re
rather
late
in
the
day
coming
here
aren
t
you
asked
his
majesty
the
courtier
pulled
out
a
large
watch
it
is
i
believe
at
the
present
moment
and
a
half
minutes
after
eight
your
majesty
at
eight
precisely
i
received
orders
from
your
majesty
s
son
to
come
hither
bringing
with
me
your
majesty
s
coach
and
guard
of
honour
likewise
a
person
by
name
mumkie
who
is
for
the
future
to
inhabit
this
cottage
and
to
enjoy
the
privilege
of
using
for
his
own
purposes
all
the
live
oxen
kine
sows
pigs
cocks
here
the
king
interrupted
him
that
is
enough
tell
them
to
get
the
carriage
ready
for
three
and
send
mumkie
to
just
so
your
majesty
said
the
courtier
and
departed
on
his
errand
when
he
had
gone
the
king
said
to
the
queen
and
ernalie
now
my
dears
run
up
and
put
on
your
best
things
and
araminta
just
see
if
our
crowns
are
tarnished
we
ought
to
make
our
triumphal
entry
in
state
for
we
are
reinstated
and
by
the
bye
see
if
you
ve
got
an
old
coronet
of
treblo
s
that
will
fit
what
for
your
majesty
asked
ernalie
in
surprise
for
you
to
wear
of
course
said
the
king
but
what
do

want
with
a
crown
i
have
to
stop
here
with
m
part
of
the
live
good
gracious
what
do
you
mean
said
the
king
and
queen
together
well
you
see
the
agreement
between
your
son
and
mumkie
was
that
mumkie
should
have
the
live
stock
of
the
farm
and
as
i
m
alive
i
suppose
i
m
part
of
the
live
i
suppose
you
are
said
the
king
just
at
that
moment
a
voice
was
heard
outside
saying
may
i
come
in
oh
yes
come
in
said
the
king
and
mumkie
entered
looking
very
dirty
and
black
with
for
you
see
he
had
spent
the
night
in
the
they
were
all
very
much
surprised
and
naturally
too
and
the
king
remarked
you
washed
mumkie
shook
his
head
i
ve
been
it
s
not
quite
the
same
thing
your
well
never
mind
so
there
s
been
a
revolt
has
there
a
revolution
sire
answered
mumkie
ah
well
it
s
all
the
same
they
manage
these
things
quickly
here
by
the
bye
what
was
the
arrangement
that
my
son
made
about
this
house
he
said
i
was
to
have
the
house
and
all
the
live
the
live
stock
said
the
king
all
your
then
i
m
afraid
it
s
all
up
with
you
ernalie
i
m
afraid
it
is
your
majesty
unless
your
majesty
would
buy
me
from
this
good
idea
what
ll
you
take
for
her
mumkie
mumkie
looked
at
her
critically
what
s
your
weight
he
said
to
her
suddenly
i
don
t
exactly
see
what
that
has
to
do
with
well
i
suppose
you
re
good
aren
t
you
oh
very
good
said
the
princess
she
s
as
good
as
gold
said
the
queen
just
so
said
mumkie
that
s
why
i
wanted
to
know
her
weight
you
see
i
ll
sell
her
to
you
for
her
weight
in
the
king
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
drew
out
his
purse
and
looked
into
it
will
you
take
on
account
he
said
but
mumkie
shook
his
head
we
only
take
ready
money
here
or
pay
on
then
i
suppose
the
only
thing
to
do
is
to
go
to
the
palace
and
fetch
the
money
till
then
so
ernalie
kissed
the
king
and
queen
and
watched
them
go
down
the
garden
walk
to
the
carriage
and
saw
them
get
in
the
guard
of
honour
fired
a
royal
salute
and
they
drove
off
at
a
gallop
but
ernalie
turned
back
into
the
house
where
mumkie
was
awaiting
her
i
ve
got
a
friend
coming
here
shortly
and
i
don
t
want
to
have
our
conversation
overheard
so
when
he
comes
you
cut
your
stick
go
and
perform
some
wholesome
menial
the
plates
understand
and
don
t
you
listen
at
the
door
i
am
not
in
the
habit
of
listening
at
doors
and
you
d
better
call
me
your
royal
highness
if
you
and
why
your
royal
highness
because
i
m
a
oh
you
are
then
i
suppose
you
re
a
foreigner
and
they
have
a
custom
here
with
foreigners
of
boiling
them
alive
how
would
you
like
that
your
royal
highness
you
daren
t
do
it
said
the
princess
but
all
the
same
she
felt
rather
frightened
just
then
a
knock
came
at
the
door
that
s
wopole
said
mumkie
so
your
royal
highness
may
take
yourself
off
and
if
i
catch
you
listening
at
the
door
i
ll
skin
you
i
never
listen
at
doors
said
the
princess
but
she
thought
to
herself
i
listen
inside
the
room
sometimes
and
she
ran
upstairs
to
fetch
her
feather
she
got
it
very
quickly
and
ran
downstairs
as
lightly
as
possible
they
had
shut
the
door
of
the
room
but
she
opened
it
boldly
and
stepped
in
as
quietly
as
she
could
mumkie
looked
up
as
if
he
expected
to
see
some
one
come
in
but
of
course
he
did
not
it
s
the
wind
i
suppose
said
wopole
anyhow
you
d
better
shut
it
some
one
might
be
so
mumkie
got
up
and
shut
it
and
then
went
back
to
his
seat
again
you
say
you
can
t
try
to
murder
this
prince
again
he
said
wopole
shook
his
head
it
s
no
good
i
tried
last
night
and
i
got
such
a
box
on
my
ear
that
i
was
half
but
who
gave
it
to
you
how
on
earth
should
i
know
i
could
see
nobody
just
as
i
was
raising
the
pistol
to
it
came
i
wouldn
t
try
it
again
for
what
a
nuisance
it
is
that
you
let
that
feather
fall
out
of
the
eagle
s
tail
you
could
have
done
it
easily
then
as
it
is
i
don
t
know
what
to
do
you
won
t
try
again
and
i
m
too
old
and
no
one
else
in
the
country
would
hurt
him
for
love
or
money
there
s
only
one
other
thing
to
do
and
it
s
not
an
easy
task
oh
never
mind
the
ease
or
difficulty
if
it
s
possible
to
be
done
i
ll
do
then
i
ll
tell
you
you
ll
have
to
cut
his
thread
of
really
and
what
with
oh
anything
you
like
the
trouble
is
to
get
to
the
place
where
they
re
oh
and
where
is
that
they
re
kept
by
three
old
women
who
live
in
the
moon
they
re
called
the
and
how
am
i
to
get
to
the
moon
that
s
just
it
you
ll
have
to
take
a
boat
one
evening
at
six
and
if
you
sail
straight
towards
the
moon
while
she
is
visible
and
anchor
when
she
is
out
of
sight
in
three
weeks
and
two
days
you
will
reach
the
end
of
the
sea
where
the
moon
touches
at
night
and
then
you
can
get
out
of
the
boat
and
take
care
to
haul
it
up
out
of
reach
of
the
sea
or
else
it
ll
be
carried
off
and
you
won
t
be
able
to
get
back
to
the
earth
and
when
i
ve
got
to
the
moon
what
am
i
to
do
the
moon
s
not
a
very
large
place
although
it
s
certainly
larger
than
it
looks
from
the
earth
there
are
five
people
who
live
in
the
moon
one
is
the
man
in
the
moon
the
rest
are
all
women
these
are
three
fates
who
sit
twisting
the
threads
of
life
into
one
large
rope
and
besides
that
there
s
diana
but
she
keeps
to
herself
and
never
troubles
about
the
other
four
when
you
touch
the
shore
you
ll
see
the
man
in
the
moon
he
s
a
wrinkled
old
man
who
carries
a
bundle
of
sticks
and
a
lanthorn
when
you
meet
him
give
him
a
loaf
of
bread
to
pacify
him
for
the
moon
being
made
of
green
cheese
they
have
nothing
else
to
eat
and
so
they
re
very
fond
of
bread
to
eat
with
it
ask
him
the
way
to
the
miss
are
the
three
fates
he
ll
show
you
in
reward
for
the
bread
and
then
you
ll
see
the
house
knock
at
the
door
and
when
it
s
opened
slip
in
the
fates
are
blind
and
won
t
see
you
when
you
get
in
you
ll
see
a
lot
of
reels
of
silver
threads
among
them
you
ll
see
his
thread
you
ll
know
it
by
the
label
on
the
reel
cut
that
and
those
of
the
king
and
queen
and
then
come
back
again
as
soon
as
you
very
well
then
when
shall
i
start
asked
wopole
when
you
will
evening
do
yes
quite
very
well
i
ll
start
evening
about
eight
in
the
meantime
i
must
see
about
getting
food
as
i
m
not
a
fasting
very
well
just
then
came
a
knock
at
the
door
and
wopole
said
well
i
suppose
it
s
settled
i
shall
open
the
door
and
see
who
s
yes
do
i
suppose
it
s
some
one
come
to
buy
this
oh
is
it
and
wopole
went
to
open
the
door
the
princess
meanwhile
quietly
slipped
upstairs
and
took
the
feather
out
in
a
few
moments
she
heard
a
voice
calling
her
and
she
went
down
she
found
the
prince
with
the
other
two
in
the
little
parlour
ernalie
he
said
and
she
answered
this
absurd
man
the
prince
went
on
insists
that
you
shall
be
weighed
although
i
offered
him
two
thousand
ounces
of
gold
and
i
m
sure
you
don
t
weigh
that
however
he
will
have
you
weighed
and
it
can
t
be
i
suppose
it
can
t
said
the
princess
so
she
was
weighed
it
doesn
t
matter
what
she
did
weigh
but
it
was
less
than
two
thousand
ounces
the
prince
ordered
the
two
men
whom
he
had
brought
with
him
as
bearers
of
the
gold
to
stop
and
see
it
properly
weighed
out
and
then
he
set
out
with
the
princess
for
the
town
i
thought
you
wouldn
t
mind
there
not
being
an
escort
he
said
apologetically
but
all
the
people
about
the
palace
are
busy
preparing
for
a
the
princess
said
she
didn
t
mind
at
all
she
had
not
had
much
time
to
think
about
what
she
had
heard
wopole
and
mumkie
say
nevertheless
she
determined
to
tell
the
prince
all
she
had
heard
when
he
had
listened
to
it
all
he
laughed
ah
well
if
that
s
all
i
ve
got
to
fear
i
m
quite
safe
he
s
sure
to
get
drowned
if
he
tries
was
all
he
said
and
he
refused
to
say
anything
more
on
the
subject
so
they
went
quietly
on
till
they
came
to
a
slight
hill
down
which
the
road
went
and
from
the
top
they
could
see
the
city
shining
in
the
morning
sun
it
s
a
very
beautiful
place
isn
t
it
said
the
prince
very
beautiful
only
my
own
country
is
far
more
it
must
be
very
beautiful
indeed
then
however
i
suppose
this
is
good
enough
for
you
while
you
are
away
from
your
own
it
ll
have
to
be
at
any
rate
said
the
princess
dismally
as
they
went
down
the
hill
they
soon
reached
the
city
and
went
through
crowds
of
bowing
citizens
and
citizenesses
to
the
palace
where
they
found
the
king
and
queen
anxiously
awaiting
them
so
you
ve
come
at
last
the
king
said
i
was
afraid
that
you
would
come
to
some
harm
with
that
but
the
princess
laughed
oh
no
she
said
i
m
quite
able
to
take
care
of
myself
and
of
other
people
too
and
while
i
was
in
the
house
i
heard
something
of
great
and
she
proceeded
to
tell
them
what
she
had
heard
but
when
she
had
finished
the
king
laughed
even
more
than
his
son
had
done
why
my
dear
little
girl
he
said
do
you
believe
all
that
rigmarole
they
were
having
a
joke
at
your
expense
they
must
have
heard
you
outside
the
door
and
wanted
to
frighten
you
don
t
you
think
of
such
rubbish
why
if
they
tried
it
on
alone
they
d
get
swallowed
up
in
a
storm
and
i
m
sure
none
of
my
people
would
ever
help
but
the
princess
did
not
feel
at
all
convinced
all
the
same
you
might
just
as
well
have
them
put
in
prison
and
then
they
couldn
t
do
but
the
king
shook
his
head
that
s
just
it
you
see
i
ve
only
just
let
them
go
and
i
can
t
put
them
into
prison
unless
they
ve
committed
some
fresh
but
isn
t
it
treason
to
compass
the
death
of
the
king
or
his
eldest
son
it
is
but
then
it
s
such
a
foolish
scheme
that
no
one
would
believe
any
one
capable
of
inventing
it
so
we
d
better
leave
it
but
still
the
princess
was
not
at
all
convinced
if
you
won
t
stop
him
going
i
shall
go
with
him
she
said
but
he
won
t
take
you
said
the
king
he
won
t
be
able
to
help
it
said
she
oh
well
have
your
own
way
my
dear
said
the
king
for
he
thought
she
would
change
her
mind
but
she
was
quite
in
earnest
however
she
didn
t
say
anything
more
about
it
and
the
rest
of
the
day
went
on
quietly
the
old
king
and
his
son
attended
the
council
just
as
if
nothing
unusual
had
ever
intervened
between
it
and
the
last
council
they
had
held
before
they
had
been
turned
out
as
for
the
queen
and
princess
they
occupied
themselves
with
choosing
dresses
for
a
grand
ball
that
was
to
be
given
on
the
day
after
the
morrow
so
that
the
time
was
pretty
well
filled
up
until
the
evening
and
as
the
princess
said
she
felt
rather
tired
she
went
out
to
take
a
walk
on
the
sands
by
the
sea
to
tell
the
truth
she
intended
to
see
whether
wopole
were
not
making
preparations
now
it
so
happened
that
the
prince
too
was
going
out
to
take
an
evening
stroll
and
so
they
went
together
and
as
the
town
was
rather
full
they
walked
along
the
beach
to
get
out
of
the
way
of
the
enthusiastic
populace
who
insisted
on
congratulating
him
on
his
good
fortune
this
is
a
habit
of
populaces
they
are
all
fond
of
congratulating
any
one
who
is
they
never
assist
any
one
to
success
if
they
can
help
it
so
they
walked
on
for
some
time
and
as
the
evening
was
approaching
turned
back
towards
the
harbour
now
it
happened
that
as
they
came
round
a
bend
of
the
shore
they
noticed
a
crowd
assembled
round
one
of
the
boats
i
wonder
what
the
excitement
is
said
the
princess
i
don
t
know
really
unless
it
s
some
gigantic
or
perhaps
they
ve
found
a
scale
of
the
shall
we
go
and
look
at
it
yes
let
us
said
the
princess
eagerly
and
so
they
went
towards
the
crowd
who
made
way
at
their
approach
why
it
s
wopole
said
the
princess
suddenly
and
so
it
was
what
is
he
up
to
asked
the
prince
of
one
of
the
bystanders
i
don
t
know
your
majesty
only
we
saw
him
coming
along
bringing
packages
of
things
to
his
boat
here
and
we
thought
we
d
come
and
see
that
he
wasn
t
up
to
the
prince
then
spoke
to
wopole
who
was
looking
angrily
at
him
well
wopole
he
said
what
are
you
up
to
now
i
m
going
to
leave
the
country
said
he
angrily
a
good
thing
for
the
country
said
several
of
the
crowd
but
the
prince
said
i
m
sorry
you
re
going
to
leave
us
however
i
shall
be
glad
to
make
you
a
small
present
before
you
and
he
felt
in
his
coat
and
after
a
moment
s
search
he
drew
out
a
minute
pair
of
perhaps
these
might
be
of
some
use
to
you
they
re
very
good
for
cutting
threads
of
any
kind
and
pretending
not
to
notice
his
look
of
astonishment
he
drew
the
princess
s
arm
through
his
and
they
walked
off
why
did
you
do
that
asked
the
princess
after
they
had
got
out
of
hearing
the
prince
laughed
i
thought
it
might
surprise
him
a
little
he
said
and
they
wouldn
t
cut
butter
if
they
were
heated
so
he
won
t
do
much
harm
with
so
you
don
t
mean
to
stop
him
the
prince
laughed
no
no
he
said
why
should
i
he
ll
never
get
to
the
then
if
you
don
t
stop
him
i
shall
go
with
i
think
he
ll
take
care
that
you
don
t
retorted
the
prince
but
he
won
t
be
able
to
help
and
why
not
because
he
won
t
be
able
to
see
nonsense
you
may
call
it
nonsense
if
you
like
but
do
you
remember
some
one
who
spoke
to
you
last
night
in
the
square
you
couldn
t
see
me
then
and
why
should
he
stop
me
if
he
can
t
see
me
good
gracious
was
that
you
last
night
how
stupid
of
me
not
to
recognise
your
voice
but
you
won
t
go
with
him
will
you
i
shall
unless
you
stop
but
i
promised
not
to
stop

and
i
can
t
break

then
i
must
go
that
s
all
i
can
t
allow
you
and
your
father
and
mother
to
be
killed
because
you

promised
not
to

but
ernalie

wouldn

and

can

make

invisible

but
all
the
same
you
must
not
go

s
why
you
may
be
drowned
or
if
i
m
drowned
or
anything
wopole
will
have
to
be
drowned
or
anythinged
too
so
that
you
ll
be
safe
in
any
but
i
don
t
want
to
be
safe
if
you
are
what
difference
will
it
make
to
you
if
i
m
drowned
or
not
oh
ernalie
you
are
too
bad
he
said
earnestly
can
t
you
see
i
love
you
more
than
all
the
world
the
princess
looked
at
him
in
utter
astonishment
you
love
me
she
said
with
her
lips
parted
and
the
colour
coming
and
going
in
her
cheeks
why
whatever
made
you
and
the
prince
answered
naturally
why
you
did
of
but
you
ve
not
known
me
for
more
than
two
if
i
had
known
you
only
for
two
hours
it
would
have
been
more
than
enough
you
are
the
most
beautiful
girl
i
ever
perhaps
you
ve
not
seen
many
said
the
princess
he
took
no
notice
of
her
flippant
was
very
much
in
earnest
i
love
you
as
much
as
the
whole
world
and
a
great
deal
besides
and
don
t
you
love
me
a
little
in
return
well
to
tell
the
truth
i
never
thought
of
it
at
all
before
but
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
i
do
love
you
and
a
very
great
deal
you
don
t
so
they
prolonged
the
stroll
indefinitely
thinking
nothing
about
the
unpleasant
walking
that
the
heavy
shingle
afforded
or
even
that
it
was
getting
very
dark
and
that
the
air
was
chilly
with
the
night
and
the
that
the
wind
blew
against
them
so
that
it
was
after
by
a
great
deal
when
they
arrived
at
the
palace
once
more
but
all
that
he
could
say
would
not
persuade
her
not
to
go
with
wopole
although
she
was
very
sorry
that
she
could
not
stop
but
as
she
said
it
was
no
use
stopping
if
her
love
died
and
if
any
one
was
to
die
she
would
be
the
one
wopole
was
sure
to
die
with
her
so
the
prince
would
be
safe
at
any
rate
and
although
the
king
and
queen
both
tried
to
dissuade
her
it
made
no
difference
she
refused
to
promise
not
to
go
so
on
the
next
day
they
watched
her
carefully
though
without
hindering
her
going
about
the
day
went
past
just
as
the
day
before
had
done
and
about
the
same
time
in
the
evening
she
asked
the
prince
to
go
down
to
the
beach
with
her
and
they
went
just
as
before
but
all
the
while
the
prince
kept
fast
hold
of
her
hand
so
they
walked
along
the
beach
as
the
wind
freshened
and
they
talked
of
all
sorts
of
things
is
not
necessary
to
say
what
but
the
princess
noticed
that
the
boat
which
wopole
had
loaded
with
provisions
was
almost
in
the
water
and
wopole
and
mumkie
were
both
standing
talking
by
it
so
she
drew
the
feather
quietly
out
of
her
pocket
for
you
may
be
sure
she
had
not
forgotten
to
bring
it
suddenly
she
said
oh
dear
my
shoe
s
full
of
sand
i
must
take
it
off
and
shake
it
will
you
let
me
do
it
for
you
said
the
prince
who
stepped
easily
into
the
trap
yes
you
might
if
it
s
not
too
much
trouble
she
said
so
he
knelt
down
and
unlaced
her
shoe
took
it
off
and
shook
out
the
sand
and
then
put
it
on
again
for
her
he
was
just
getting
up
again
when
the
princess
gave
him
a
little
push
so
that
he
lost
his
balance
altogether
and
before
he
could
recover
himself
she
put
the
feather
to
her
hair
and
ran
along
the
sands
to
the
boat
which
wopole
and
mumkie
were
just
about
to
launch
she
stepped
over
the
back
just
before
they
reached
it
and
then
she
went
at
once
to
the
front
of
the
boat
in
order
not
to
be
in
the
way
of
wopole
when
he
got
on
board
in
a
moment
the
boat
was
dancing
on
the
water
and
wopole
sprang
in
over
the
stern
the
boat
shipped
a
good
deal
over
the
bows
and
the
princess
got
rather
wet
however
she
was
too
excited
to
care
much
about
a
little
water
in
a
few
moments
wopole
had
hauled
up
the
sail
and
the
boat
began
to
move
through
the
dancing
waters
just
at
this
moment
treblo
reached
the
edge
of
the
sea
and
saw
the
boat
well
out
of
his
power
come
back
he
cried
to
wopole
don
t
you
said
mumkie
you
needn
t
be
afraid
wopole
called
as
loud
as
he
could
i
shan
t
come
back
but
you
ve
got
the
princess
on
board
you
bet
remarked
wopole
with
familiar
vulgarity
now
he
was
out
of
the
prince
s
reach
the
princess
thought
it
was
her
turn
to
say
something
so
she
called
treblo
my
love
wopole
was
naturally
somewhat
surprised
at
this
voice
that
appeared
to
come
from
nowhere
in
particular
i
suppose
she
s
hanging
in
the
water
he
said
to
himself
out
loud
i
shan
t
trouble
to
help
her
on
board
if
she
is
i
shall
just
let
her
how
very
good
of
you
remarked
ernalie
sweetly
wopole
looked
surprised
sounds
as
if
she
was
on
board
however
she
isn
and
as
the
princess
thought
it
best
to
be
quiet
he
remained
of
the
same
opinion
all
the
while
the
boat
had
been
getting
rapidly
out
of
the
bay
and
the
princess
thought
they
were
quite
safe
from
pursuit
but
suddenly
wopole
rose
from
his
seat
in
the
stern
and
let
down
the
sail
what
on
earth
is
he
going
to
do
thought
the
princess
he
can
t
be
going
to
however
it
was
soon
pretty
clear
what
he
was
going
to
do
for
she
noticed
he
was
steering
towards
a
large
vessel
that
lay
near
them
the
way
that
the
sail
had
left
on
the
boat
was
sufficient
to
carry
them
to
the
vessel
which
the
boat
soon
bumped
against
wopole
now
seemed
to
be
coming
forward
and
as
there
was
not
room
in
the
boat
for
her
to
slip
past
him
she
jumped
from
the
bow
and
managed
to
scramble
on
board
the
ship
although
it
was
rather
difficult
and
boats
have
a
habit
of
slipping
away
under
any
one
who
tries
jumping
off
them
however
she
luckily
managed
it
and
was
soon
safe
on
board
she
was
followed
almost
immediately
by
wopole
who
didn
t
find
much
difficulty
in
getting
on
board
in
fact
he
came
so
quickly
that
he
almost
fell
on
top
of
the
princess
however
she
just
managed
to
slip
out
of
his
way
and
he
did
not
notice
her
as
he
was
occupied
in
tying
the
to
a
cleat
he
then
went
through
various
nautical
as
boxing
the
compass
and
shivering
his
timbers
and
danging
his
and
other
things
which
it
takes
a
sailor
or
a
nautical
to
understand
the
effect
of
these
operations
was
to
make
the
sails
run
up
and
then
the
vessel
bent
to
the
freshening
gale
and
began
to
walk
the
waters
like
a
thing
of
least
as
like
a
thing
of
life
as
a
wet
sheet
and
a
flowing
sea
and
a
wind
to
follow
after
but
no
legs
could
make
it
walk
wopole
had
taken
the
helm
by
this
time
and
he
was
steering
a
course
east
by
west
so
that
they
is
they
out
from
the
shore
thus
they
sailed
on
for
an
hour
or
two
till
the
moon
began
to
show
itself
and
then
wopole
altered
the
course
so
that
they
sailed
straight
towards
her
it
might
be
as
well
to
explain
that
in
those
days
a
ship
was
only
provided
with
two
sails
and
so
one
man
could
manage
a
pretty
large
ship
and
as
wopole
was
a
very
strong
man
it
stands
to
reason
that
he
could
manage
a
rather
large
ship
so
you
see
it
was
not
altogether
so
impossible
as
it
looks
to
sail
for
three
weeks
alone
on
the
sea
although
i
own
it
would
be
somewhat
difficult
nowadays
when
the
moon
rose
as
i
have
mentioned
before
wopole
steered
straight
for
it
and
he
continued
steering
straight
towards
it
all
least
all
the
time
that
the
moon
could
be
seen
towards
sunrise
however
the
moon
set
and
as
soon
as
he
could
see
it
no
more
he
let
down
the
sail
threw
his
anchor
overboard
and
in
a
few
moments
the
ship
was
at
rest
when
this
had
been
done
he
walked
to
a
hatch
which
he
opened
and
took
out
some
beef
captain
s
biscuits
and
pickled
pork
from
these
he
cut
slices
and
placed
the
slices
on
plates
after
which
he
took
the
joints
back
to
the
hatchway
and
put
them
in
the
again
then
he
filled
a
glass
with
water
from
a
little
cistern
that
stood
on
deck
after
these
preparations
he
sat
down
and
made
a
comfortable
meal
and
then
he
went
is
down
the
into
his
cabin
he
seemed
to
have
departed
for
good
so
the
princess
followed
his
least
so
far
as
the
eating
was
concerned
only
she
washed
the
knives
forks
and
plates
before
she
used
them
i
wonder
if
he
ll
see
any
difference
in
the
size
of
the
joints
she
thought
to
herself
if
he
does
he
won
t
know
how
it
is
so
that
s
all
so
she
made
a
hearty
meal
and
then
replaced
the
things
just
as
he
had
put
them
the
question
now
to
pass
away
the
time
it
was
a
very
difficult
one
to
answer
there
were
no
books
to
least
she
was
not
able
to
find
any
on
deck
so
she
tried
playing
cat
by
herself
but
that
was
not
a
very
great
success
because
there
was
no
one
to
take
it
up
she
next
attempted
going
to
sleep
but
that
was
not
a
success
either
then
she
tried
counting
how
many
times
the
ship
rolled
in
the
course
of
an
hour
but
she
always
forgot
how
many
hundreds
she
had
counted
at
last
she
went
and
sat
on
one
of
the
bulwarks
and
watched
the
porpoises
as
they
played
about
the
ship
s
bows
so
the
day
passed
away
and
evening
came
and
just
as
the
sun
set
wopole
came
on
deck
yawning
and
stretching
himself
he
looked
at
the
vane
which
was
blown
out
nearly
straight
in
the
evening
wind
a
nice
breeze
the
princess
heard
him
say
to
himself
if
the
wind
holds
good
like
this
it
won
t
take
more
than
a
thank
goodness
the
princess
said
to
herself
for
she
was
beginning
already
to
grow
rather
tired
of
the
adventure
i
think
i
ll
go
down
and
see
what
the
vessel
is
like
so
she
descended
the
dark
hatchway
as
well
as
she
could
though
it
was
no
easy
matter
for
the
boat
was
beginning
to
roll
in
a
most
unpleasant
manner
for
you
see
the
wind
was
freshening
a
good
deal
and
wopole
had
not
yet
hoisted
the
sails
however
she
managed
to
get
to
the
bottom
without
tumbling
down
more
than
four
steps
at
a
time
it
was
not
quite
dark
in
the
cabin
below
for
an
open
let
in
the
last
rays
of
daylight
the
cabin
was
a
very
small
one
though
it
did
not
seem
very
cosy
however
the
princess
was
delighted
to
see
one
thing
and
that
was
that
there
were
some
books
on
a
table
in
the
centre
of
the
cabin
she
went
and
looked
at
their
titles
but
it
was
too
dark
to
read
them
and
she
didn
t
know
where
to
find
the
matches
through
the
porthole
she
could
see
that
the
sea
was
getting
rougher
and
the
waves
were
beginning
to
dash
loudly
against
the
side
of
the
boat
it
ll
be
getting
wet
on
deck
she
thought
to
herself
i
think
i
shall
stop
where
i
am
for
i
hate
being
damp
and
i
m
quite
comfortable
just
at
this
moment
she
heard
heavy
steps
coming
down
the
hatchway
good
gracious
here
s
wopole
coming
down
what
does
he
want
i
wonder
wopole
opened
the
door
and
looked
in
but
he
didn
t
seem
to
notice
her
he
just
put
his
arm
round
the
door
and
unhooked
a
tarpaulin
coat
that
was
hanging
there
then
he
took
a
sou
from
another
peg
and
put
it
on
his
head
and
shut
the
door
again
and
she
heard
him
tramp
up
on
to
the
deck
i
suppose
he
s
gone
for
good
she
said
to
herself
anyhow
i
ll
lock
the
door
and
then
he
won
t
be
able
to
get
so
she
locked
the
door
with
the
key
that
was
in
the
lock
now
i
wonder
where
the
bed
is
she
thought
that
place
like
a
shelf
can
t
be
it
but
it
s
got
on
it
however
i
can
t
get
into
it
i
shall
just
lie
on
this
sofa
for
the
so
she
lay
down
and
slept
all
night
in
spite
of
the
noise
that
the
wind
and
waves
made
she
awoke
next
morning
on
hearing
a
most
tremendous
rumble
and
splashing
what
is
that
she
said
to
herself
he
must
be
letting
out
the
and
so
he
was
for
in
a
moment
she
heard
him
coming
downstairs
i
wonder
what
he
ll
do
when
he
finds
the
door
locked
she
thought
just
then
he
reached
the
door
and
turned
the
handle
but
the
door
refused
to
move
and
although
he
kicked
and
banged
it
was
all
no
use
i
ll
go
and
fetch
a
hatchet
and
prise
it
open
he
grunted
out
of
breath
with
his
exertions
and
he
thumped
up
the
stairs
again
but
meanwhile
the
princess
unlocked
the
door
and
seizing
a
couple
of
books
at
random
off
the
bookshelf
she
ran
up
on
deck
but
she
kept
possession
of
the
now
it
so
happened
that
wopole
had
dropped
his
hatchet
in
front
of
the
hatchway
and
he
was
bending
down
to
pick
it
up
just
as
she
came
out
of
it
so
that
the
result
was
a
collision
and
as
wopole
was
bending
down
he
got
considerably
the
worst
of
it
although
the
books
that
the
princess
was
carrying
were
thrown
right
out
of
her
hands
wopole
got
up
from
the
sitting
posture
which
the
sudden
shock
had
made
him
assume
well
this
is
extraordinary
shiver
my
old
if
it
isn
t
here
first
i
can
t
get
into
my
cabin
and
then
i
m
knocked
over
by
my
own
books
that
come
flying
at
my
head
i
think
it
s
those
books
that
are
the
cause
of
the
mischief
and
i
ll
just
throw
them
overboard
and
he
was
just
bending
over
to
pick
them
up
but
this
was
too
much
for
the
princess
who
had
no
wish
to
be
left
for
the
whole
of
another
day
without
books
so
she
snatched
the
books
from
just
under
his
least
the
book
he
was
going
to
pick
as
soon
as
she
touched
it
it
became
invisible
wopole
shook
his
head
dismally
as
if
he
had
quite
expected
it
and
then
he
tried
to
pick
up
the
other
one
but
just
the
same
thing
happened
now
the
princess
had
just
been
bending
down
to
pick
the
book
up
as
he
bent
down
and
the
wind
blew
her
hair
right
across
his
eyes
he
feeling
the
tickling
put
his
hand
up
to
his
face
and
caught
the
hair
before
she
could
draw
it
away
what
is
this
now
he
said
as
he
examined
his
hand
feels
like
hair
he
mused
but
in
his
fit
of
musing
he
let
his
fingers
relax
their
grasp
and
she
drew
her
hair
away
very
quickly
i
thought
so
wopole
said
it
was
only
the
wind
i
mean
i
wonder
what
s
the
matter
with
the
books
though
it
must
be
the
cabin
that
s
bewitched
them
i
won
t
sleep
in
that
cabin
i
ll
change
my
apartments
at
and
he
did
so
for
the
rest
of
the
time
the
princess
had
the
cabin
all
to
herself
and
she
was
quite
contented
for
wopole
was
so
sure
that
it
was
bewitched
that
he
moved
his
clothes
and
things
out
of
it
and
never
came
near
it
again
and
the
princess
had
decidedly
the
best
of
it
for
wopole
slept
all
day
and
watched
all
night
and
she
kept
awake
all
day
and
slept
all
night
just
as
usual
so
the
time
passed
away
and
every
night
the
moon
got
larger
and
larger
as
they
got
nearer
and
nearer
until
it
was
quite
close
they
had
been
a
fortnight
and
three
days
out
before
they
came
to
the
edge
of
the
sea
but
it
was
eight
o
clock
in
the
evening
and
the
moon
had
just
left
the
water
as
it
flew
into
the
air
like
a
very
bird
what
a
confounded
nuisance
ernalie
heard
wopole
say
now
i
shall
have
to
wait
the
whole
of
another
day
for
it
to
rise
above
the
sea
and
then
it
s
so
jolly
the
princess
couldn
t
help
wondering
why
it
was
so
jolly
dangerous
and
how
if
it
were
dangerous
it
could
be
jolly
so
she
without
thinking
that
she
was
invisible
why
why
you
dunderhead
retorted
wopole
because
we
re
quite
near
the
edge
of
the
world
and
if
a
strong
wind
should
rise
we
should
be
blown
right
over
it
and
then
we
should
fall
right
into
the
sun
see
stupid
the
princess
replied
meekly
i
thank
i
should
think
you
ought
to
thank
me
wopole
retorted
angrily
it
s
bad
enough
to
have
spirits
on
board
a
temperance
ship
without
having
to
talk
to
but
i
m
not
a
spirit
said
ernalie
then
who
are
you
i
but
she
thought
it
best
not
to
tell
him
more
oh
you
are
are
you
he
replied
thanks
for
the
information
i
m
sure
it
wasn
t
necessary
for
you
to
tell
me
so
much
and
i
don
t
want
to
know
any
more
about
you
only
look
here
i
don
t
know
whether
you
want
to
be
roasted
of
course
not
answered
the
princess
well
then
if
a
storm
comes
up
it
will
blow
us
right
over
the
world
s
end
into
the
sun
so
look
out
if
the
anchor
holds
we
are
what
does
the
anchor
hold
asked
ernalie
the
ground
of
course
if
it
doesn
t
we
shall
have
to
hoist
the
sails
and
try
to
beat
against
the
i
suppose
you
beat
against
the
wind
to
make
it
run
away
said
ernalie
but
wopole
replied
gruffly
no
puns
allowed
on
board
now
if
we
have
to
beat
against
the
wind
i
shall
have
to
manage
the
sails
so
you
must
go
to
the
what
is
the
helm
she
asked
that
s
it
said
wopole
pointing
to
it
oh
that
s
the
helm
and
what
am
i
to
do
with
it
do
what
i
tell
very
that
s
so
the
princess
not
seeing
anything
better
to
do
went
down
below
to
bed
the
night
passed
safely
and
nearly
the
whole
of
the
next
day
but
towards
evening
the
wind
began
to
get
up
wopole
was
on
deck
and
as
he
did
not
seem
to
wish
to
talk
she
let
him
alone
about
seven
the
moon
was
to
rise
and
at
about
five
ernalie
went
down
to
her
cabin
to
get
a
book
she
selected
a
small
one
that
she
had
not
noticed
before
it
was
called
the
life
and
surprising
adventures
of
robinson
crusoe
of
hull
mariner
but
before
she
had
half
finished
the
by
the
bye
is
rather
sudden
reeling
of
the
vessel
threw
her
right
over
to
one
corner
of
the
room
and
at
the
same
time
from
above
there
sounded
a
shrieking
as
of
ten
thousand
demons
what
on
earth
is
that
she
thought
as
well
as
she
could
for
she
was
lying
in
one
corner
of
the
room
among
chairs
and
various
other
articles
of
furniture
however
she
got
out
of
it
as
quickly
as
she
could
and
ran
on
deck
or
at
least
she
tried
to
run
for
the
vessel
was
rolling
and
pitching
and
the
shrieking
continued
to
resound
from
above
at
last
she
did
reach
the
deck
but
she
rather
wished
she
had
stopped
below
for
the
wind
was
so
biting
it
nearly
bit
her
hair
off
and
this
same
wind
behaved
so
badly
to
the
ropes
of
the
vessel
that
they
shrieked
in
their
pain
as
the
blast
cut
past
them
causing
the
strange
sounds
that
the
princess
had
heard
below
it
was
nearly
as
difficult
to
stand
on
deck
as
it
had
been
in
the
cabin
and
the
spray
that
came
dashing
over
the
boat
made
it
very
difficult
to
see
for
it
got
into
her
eyes
and
half
blinded
her
however
she
managed
to
steady
herself
by
holding
on
to
a
rope
and
in
a
few
minutes
she
was
able
to
see
wopole
standing
in
the
bow
of
the
boat
and
looking
over
the
side
so
she
went
towards
him
as
well
as
she
could
for
the
wind
and
spray
came
from
over
the
bows
nevertheless
she
reached
him
somehow
he
was
leaning
quietly
against
the
bulwarks
over
the
watching
the
straining
cable
just
as
calm
as
if
there
were
nothing
in
particular
depending
on
whether
the
anchor
held
or
not
as
soon
as
she
could
find
her
breath
she
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
and
shouted
in
his
ear
as
loud
as
she
could
will
the
rope
break
but
it
was
no
use
trying
to
the
least
for
her
when
wopole
felt
something
touch
him
on
the
shoulder
he
looked
round
oh
it
s
you
is
it
she
heard
him
cry
but
the
wind
was
still
too
high
for
her
to
answer
she
only
nodded
but
she
might
have
spared
herself
the
trouble
presently
after
she
had
waited
some
minutes
in
silence
the
wind
fell
almost
as
suddenly
as
it
had
risen
thank
goodness
it
s
over
now
she
said
and
it
was
so
quiet
that
wopole
overheard
her
easily
don
t
hulloa
till
you
re
out
of
the
wood
he
said
look
there
the
princess
did
look
and
she
saw
that
the
horizon
was
hidden
by
masses
of
white
foam
that
rose
and
fell
as
if
the
sea
were
one
great
cauldron
full
of
boiling
water
that
s
the
storm
coming
down
again
wopole
went
on
hurry
to
the
helm
and
put
it
hard
down
when
i
hoist
the
sail
for
the
cable
will
snap
like
thread
before
it
the
princess
ran
like
lightning
along
the
deck
for
the
sea
was
quite
quiet
and
the
vessel
hardly
pitched
at
all
and
she
reached
the
helm
in
a
very
few
minutes
when
she
got
there
she
stood
still
and
listened
everything
was
quiet
and
still
the
vessel
only
rolled
slightly
and
the
cordage
creaked
uneasily
as
if
it
feared
the
coming
strain
that
it
would
have
to
stand
from
where
the
sea
boiled
a
noise
low
and
grumbling
that
it
might
have
been
the
faint
growl
of
an
angry
cat
before
it
makes
a
spring
just
then
wopole
looked
towards
the
helm
mind
and
put
it
hard
down
he
shouted
i
wonder
why
he
wants
me
to
put
it
down
she
thought
but
before
she
could
ask
the
storm
was
upon
them
again
swifter
than
the
arrow
leaps
from
the
bow
it
came
and
the
churned
sea
fled
from
the
attack
of
the
wind
like
a
mighty
white
horse
the
flying
scud
and
rain
beat
mercilessly
against
her
face
but
she
held
bravely
to
the
tiller
and
stemmed
the
storm
as
well
as
she
could
with
her
eyes
shut
and
her
teeth
set
the
noise
the
storm
made
would
have
frightened
neptune
himself
but
high
over
it
she
heard
wopole
shout
the
cable
s
parted
hard
down
and
she
pressed
on
the
tiller
as
hard
as
she
could
but
the
stubborn
bar
refused
to
go
down
and
though
she
leant
her
whole
weight
on
it
it
only
fell
away
to
one
side
and
she
had
only
strength
to
lie
against
it
in
vain
hope
of
putting
it
down
just
then
the
sail
began
to
raise
itself
and
the
vessel
seemed
to
feel
its
influence
for
it
was
turning
slowly
round
suddenly
she
saw
wopole
appear
in
the
mist
of
rain
let
me
have
the
tiller
he
shouted
and
she
let
go
instantly
he
seized
it
and
pushed
it
the
other
way
with
all
his
might
but
at
this
critical
moment
a
disaster
happened
that
made
it
look
as
if
everything
had
conspired
against
them
the
tiller
broke
in
half
under
the
strong
hands
of
wopole
and
before
they
could
wink
the
vessel
had
turned
its
back
to
the
wind
and
they
were
carried
at
racing
speed
towards
the
end
of
the
world
they
had
but
a
mile
or
so
to
go
and
a
mile
is
soon
covered
the
last
part
of
the
journey
was
through
a
thick
mist
but
it
didn
t
much
matter
to
ernalie
anyhow
wopole
won
t
be
able
to
cut
the
strings
she
thought
just
then
the
fog
began
to
get
lighter
as
if
some
great
fire
were
just
outside
it
and
in
a
few
seconds
they
burst
through
the
veil
of
mist
into
a
light
so
blinding
that
the
princess
could
not
keep
her
eyes
open
this
must
be
the
sun
we
ve
fallen
into
she
thought
but
it
doesn
t
seem
very
then
there
was
a
bump
as
if
the
boat
had
run
into
a
lump
of
mud
and
then
a
greasy
slide
and
then
ernalie
fainted
when
she
came
to
herself
she
heard
voices
close
to
her
one
sounded
like
the
voice
of
an
old
man
and
the
other
she
was
quite
sure
was
that
of
wopole
but
she
had
never
heard
him
so
polite
before
they
had
evidently
only
just
met
for
wopole
was
saying
i
am
very
happy
to
make
your
acquaintance
sir
may
i
trouble
you
to
tell
me
your
name
it
s
a
great
deal
of
trouble
grumbled
the
other
but
i
ll
tell
you
i
m
the
how
too
happen
to
be
a
you
re
only
man
i
m
the
man
in
the
moon
i
should
think
said
wopole
exactly
answered
the
voice
why
we
must
be
in
the
moon
thought
the
princess
and
it
was
the
case
for
the
ship
had
run
right
over
the
edge
of
the
world
on
to
the
moon
which
had
been
hidden
behind
the
clouds
i
ll
just
go
and
look
at
him
she
said
to
herself
and
so
she
sat
up
to
look
where
the
voices
came
from
they
seem
to
be
behind
the
sail
she
went
on
so
she
walked
to
the
sail
and
peeped
round
the
corner
and
there
sure
enough
he
was
i
daresay
you
ve
often
seen
the
man
in
the
all
events
you
ought
to
have
perhaps
you
mayn
t
have
if
so
this
is
what
the
princess
saw
he
was
a
very
old
man
and
looked
very
much
as
if
he
was
in
his
second
childhood
and
he
carried
an
enormous
lanthorn
which
made
him
even
more
bent
than
he
might
have
been
if
he
had
not
carried
it
so
often
on
his
shoulders
he
carried
a
bundle
of
thorns
which
appeared
to
prick
him
and
cause
him
a
good
deal
of
uneasiness
generally
and
besides
this
he
had
an
ugly
little
dog
by
his
side
which
made
continual
attacks
on
wopole
s
shins
and
it
made
such
a
noise
with
its
barking
that
the
old
man
in
a
temper
aimed
a
vicious
kick
at
it
but
he
missed
his
mark
and
the
weight
of
the
lanthorn
overbalancing
him
he
sat
down
rather
suddenly
and
during
the
rest
of
the
evening
he
remained
there
but
the
conversation
proceeded
just
as
if
nothing
in
particular
had
happened
being
the
man
in
the
moon
perhaps
you
would
be
so
kind
as
to
direct
me
to
the
place
where
the
misses
parker
reside
wopole
said
that
i
won
t
said
the
man
why
should
i
i
thought
that
you
might
be
so
good
as
to
direct
me
and
i
had
intended
presenting
you
with
a
loaf
of
bread
however
that
does
not
matter
i
daresay
i
shall
find
the
house
by
myself
and
wopole
made
preparations
for
getting
over
the
side
of
the
vessel
but
the
man
no
sooner
heard
the
word
bread
than
he
became
very
eager
to
help
him
on
the
way
oh
wait
a
minute
he
said
and
wopole
accordingly
waited
if
you
ll
give
me
two
loaves
i
ll
show
you
he
went
on
i
ll
give
you
one
now
and
the
other
when
i
have
paid
my
visit
and
am
safely
back
on
the
well
that
ll
do
give
me
the
one
and
i
ll
show
you
at
so
wopole
went
to
the
hatch
which
covered
the
pantry
and
took
out
a
large
loaf
which
he
handed
to
the
old
man
now
trot
he
said
and
the
man
hurried
to
the
side
of
the
vessel
and
scrambled
down
as
well
as
he
could
followed
by
wopole
and
the
princess
it
was
curious
how
bright
it
was
when
they
got
over
the
side
for
although
it
was
past
nine
o
clock
by
the
princess
s
watch
the
ground
itself
seemed
to
shoot
out
light
and
what
was
still
more
funny
they
threw
no
shadows
although
that
was
easily
explained
for
as
the
moon
itself
provided
the
light
it
would
be
rather
difficult
to
throw
a
shadow
on
the
moon
they
plodded
on
for
some
time
in
silence
but
although
the
old
man
hobbled
very
much
he
managed
to
get
along
very
fast
almost
too
fast
for
the
princess
for
the
walking
was
very
heavy
presently
wopole
said
how
soft
the
ground
is
is
it
all
the
same
about
here
of
course
it
is
it
s
all
cheese
and
you
don
t
want
hard
i
don
t
want
cheese
at
all
said
wopole
you
d
want
it
if
you
were
me
remarked
the
old
man
why
asked
wopole
because
it
s
all
there
is
to
eat
in
the
moon
and
if
it
were
hard
i
shouldn
t
be
able
to
eat
oh
i
see
but
why
don
t
you
come
to
the
earth
you
d
make
your
fortune
in
a
the
man
shook
his
head
sadly
i
did
try
once
but
i
got
my
mouth
burnt
and
i
shan
t
try
why
how
was
that
asked
wopole
don
t
you
know
the
song
said
the
old
man
in
astonishment
not
then
i
ll
sing
and
forthwith
he
began
to
sing
the
man
in
the
moon
came
down
too
soon
and
asked
his
way
to
norwich
o
he
got
sent
to
the
south
and
burnt
his
mouth
with
eating
cold
the
man
s
voice
itself
was
about
as
melodious
as
that
of
a
peacock
but
in
the
final
o
of
the
song
he
was
joined
by
his
dog
and
wopole
who
both
rather
wrong
note
and
as
each
was
proud
of
his
voice
the
o
was
prolonged
indefinitely
and
it
might
have
been
kept
up
till
doomsday
only
just
at
that
moment
they
happened
to
turn
the
corner
of
a
heap
of
cheese
and
came
in
sight
of
a
cottage
at
some
distance
off
that
s
the
cottage
where
they
live
said
the
old
man
and
no
sooner
did
the
princess
hear
his
words
than
she
started
off
at
a
run
towards
it
i
must
get
there
before
him
she
said
and
so
she
went
as
fast
as
she
could
over
the
soft
cheese
she
really
needn
t
have
hurried
so
much
for
wopole
and
the
old
man
had
stopped
and
it
might
have
saved
her
a
world
of
trouble
if
she
had
listened
to
what
they
said
but
she
didn
t
when
she
reached
the
cottage
she
stopped
a
moment
to
gain
breath
but
that
was
soon
done
and
she
went
to
the
door
and
tapped
no
answer
came
so
she
lifted
the
latch
gently
and
walked
in
as
quietly
as
she
could
there
goes
that
door
she
heard
an
voice
say
i
shouldn
t
take
the
trouble
to
close
it
again
if
i
were
you
it
s
the
fifth
time
it
s
blown
open
this
was
in
another
voice
it
was
impossible
for
the
princess
to
see
where
the
voice
came
from
for
the
cottage
was
so
dark
after
the
light
outside
that
for
some
moments
it
was
quite
as
black
as
night
however
gradually
her
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
twilight
for
the
open
door
did
let
in
a
good
deal
of
light
what
she
did
see
however
did
not
please
her
eyes
much
for
the
three
sisters
to
whom
wopole
gave
the
name
of
are
called
the
parcae
about
as
ugly
as
they
make
them
and
as
they
were
is
was
not
much
to
choose
between
them
the
room
in
the
cottage
was
very
large
and
at
the
wall
at
one
end
a
large
number
of
frames
stood
on
which
were
nailed
reels
and
from
every
reel
came
a
silver
thread
and
over
every
reel
a
small
placard
was
placed
on
which
was
written
a
name
of
the
owner
of
the
thread
behind
the
frames
stood
one
of
the
fates
who
took
off
reels
and
placed
new
ones
in
their
stead
though
how
she
did
it
the
princess
could
not
tell
for
the
fates
as
well
as
love
are
blind
yet
she
did
it
between
the
reels
and
the
last
of
the
three
sisters
sat
one
clothed
in
black
who
held
in
her
hand
scissors
wherewith
she
severed
certain
of
the
of
those
that
die
on
earth
last
of
the
three
sat
one
who
twisted
all
the
threads
into
one
great
rope
that
ran
from
her
hands
down
a
fathomless
pit
to
the
earth
and
so
they
all
sat
silently
working
busily
with
no
other
sound
than
the
clipping
of
the
scissors
as
their
owner
cut
remorselessly
here
and
there
surely
and
needed
no
eyes
but
the
princess
heeded
little
of
this
for
she
was
seeking
out
two
names
the
names
were
arranged
in
townships
so
she
had
but
little
difficulty
in
finding
them
and
she
changed
the
names
that
stood
over
the
strings
over
wopole
s
she
put
the
name
of
treblo
and
over
treblo
she
put
wopole
s
name
it
is
the
only
way
to
stop
him
killing
treblo
as
for
the
others
abbonamento
and
araminta
if
wopole
cuts
his
own
string
and
dies
he
will
not
be
able
to
cut
theirs
but
if
he
die
not
instantly
and
cut
the
other
strings
i
will
knot
them
together
again
quickly
and
i
will
also
knot
together
wopole
s
own
thread
for
he
has
done
me
no
harm
and
once
he
saved
my
life
only
he
must
not
kill
when
she
had
got
thus
far
the
light
that
came
through
the
door
was
interrupted
for
a
moment
and
wopole
entered
he
stopped
for
a
few
minutes
to
accustom
his
eyes
to
the
faint
light
then
the
princess
heard
him
mutter
lucky
for
me
the
old
ladies
are
blind
and
deaf
here
are
his
own
scissors
to
cut
his
own
thread
that
is
to
fight
him
with
his
own
i
shall
and
then
he
walked
towards
the
sets
of
threads
in
a
few
moments
he
had
found
the
thread
marked
treblo
and
reaching
out
the
scissors
he
cut
it
through
but
he
dropped
the
scissors
almost
instantly
what
a
pain
i
have
in
my
side
he
said
i
won
t
cut
any
more
threads
if
it
s
to
hurt
me
like
this
each
time
old
abbonamento
and
araminta
won
t
last
long
after
their
son
and
as
for
the
lovely
princess
mumkie
promised
her
to
me
so
i
won
t
cut
your
string
thank
you
said
ernalie
herself
so
quietly
that
wopole
did
not
notice
it
and
he
left
the
house
in
somewhat
of
a
hurry
i
ll
just
join
his
thread
and
then
i
ll
join
him
again
and
so
there
s
not
much
harm
but
it
was
not
quite
so
easy
to
join
the
threads
as
it
looked
for
part
of
the
thread
that
went
towards
the
earth
moved
on
while
that
which
came
from
the
reel
stood
still
however
she
pulled
the
thread
rapidly
from
the
reel
and
she
managed
to
tie
the
two
parts
together
before
they
reached
the
lady
with
the
scissors
and
so
the
thread
passed
on
its
way
without
notice
that
s
all
right
said
she
thankfully
and
she
left
the
house
to
follow
wopole
he
however
had
already
passed
the
turning
and
was
out
of
sight
so
she
followed
but
when
she
too
had
turned
the
corner
he
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
however
she
was
quite
sure
of
the
road
so
she
went
leisurely
on
but
each
hillock
was
so
like
the
other
and
there
was
no
mark
to
guide
her
for
no
trees
grew
on
the
cheese
and
so
little
by
little
she
began
to
feel
convinced
that
she
had
lost
her
way
and
though
she
wandered
on
for
hours
and
hours
she
came
to
no
trace
of
anything
that
would
guide
her
to
the
vessel
but
at
last
she
came
to
some
footsteps
in
the
cheese
and
she
was
now
quite
sure
of
being
in
the
right
track
so
she
ran
on
as
fast
as
she
could
and
she
really
was
on
the
right
path
and
soon
she
came
in
sight
of
the
sea
and
then
she
saw
the
vessel
but
it
was
sailing
away
from
her
as
fast
as
it
could
and
although
she
shouted
and
cried
to
wopole
to
come
back
and
fetch
her
he
took
no
notice
wopole
wopole
she
shrieked
but
the
wind
carried
her
voice
away
and
did
not
bring
back
wopole
again
she
called
wopole
what
the
use
of
making
all
that
noise
said
a
voice
that
came
from
close
to
her
side
and
when
she
looked
round
she
saw
the
man
sitting
on
his
bundle
of
sticks
eating
the
bread
ravenously
and
scooping
up
pieces
of
the
from
his
side
what
is
the
use
of
making
all
that
noise
he
said
again
i
want
wopole
to
come
back
and
fetch
me
said
the
princess
i
daresay
he
d
feel
flattered
if
he
knew
but
he
doesn
t
it
s
no
use
howling
by
the
bye
i
forgot
to
tell
this
lanthorn
doth
the
horned
moon
but
what
that
got
to
do
with
my
getting
home
said
the
princess
i
don
t
know
but
it
s
my
home
look
the
sea
s
the
princess
looked
round
in
alarm
for
she
was
afraid
of
getting
her
feet
wet
but
though
the
sea
was
rising
it
did
not
hurt
the
moon
at
all
for
you
see
the
water
belonged
to
the
earth
and
so
while
the
moon
sank
lower
and
lower
the
water
remained
like
a
solid
wall
above
them
but
did
not
close
over
them
the
light
of
the
moon
attracted
the
fishes
and
strange
monsters
of
the
deep
and
the
princess
saw
them
as
calmly
as
if
they
had
been
part
of
a
large
aquarium
she
looked
at
them
for
some
time
but
a
strange
sound
behind
her
made
her
turn
round
i
am
about
to
sing
a
serenade
said
the
man
please
don
t
said
the
princess
i
m
sure
you
d
like
to
hear
it
i
ll
sing
you
songs
of
araby
he
said
but
i
don
t
care
about
you
really
must
listen
come
now
do
and
he
began
waving
his
arms
to
and
fro
roaring
when
moonlight
o
er
the
azure
seas
in
soft
effulgence
swells
but
he
sang
it
to
the
tune
of
the
moonlight
sonata
the
princess
did
not
wait
to
hear
she
put
her
fingers
in
her
ears
and
ran
off
as
fast
as
she
could
but
still
she
heard
the
burden
ah
angeline
ah
lady
mine
and
he
seemed
to
keep
it
up
for
a
long
while
however
after
she
had
gone
some
miles
the
sound
died
away
in
the
distance
and
all
was
quiet
the
princess
now
sat
down
to
rest
and
to
look
at
the
earth
for
the
moon
had
dipped
underneath
it
by
this
time
and
she
could
see
australia
and
new
zealand
and
various
of
the
other
lands
of
the
antipodes
her
attention
was
drawn
away
from
the
earth
to
the
moon
by
a
sound
that
seemed
like
the
rolling
of
wheels
it
was
still
distant
but
approached
rapidly
and
in
a
few
moments
a
chariot
drawn
by
two
stags
with
golden
horns
dashed
past
close
to
her
and
rolled
over
a
hill
near
by
as
easily
as
if
they
had
been
bubbles
blown
by
the
wind
but
the
princess
did
not
look
much
at
the
stags
or
the
chariot
the
thing
that
took
her
attention
was
the
driver
a
woman
you
could
hardly
have
called
her
for
though
she
was
clad
in
the
garb
of
a
huntress
it
was
easy
to
see
who
she
was
for
who
but
diana
carried
a
silver
bow
dear
me
said
ernalie
this
must
be
the
goddess
of
the
moon
i
ll
go
to
her
and
tell
her
everything
and
ask
her
to
take
me
back
to
the
earth
when
she
goes
for
she
must
go
to
the
earth
sometimes
since
she
s
the
goddess
of
the
chase
there
s
nothing
to
hunt
here
except
and
they
re
not
great
sport
for
such
a
mighty
so
she
followed
as
fast
as
she
was
able
to
the
top
of
the
hill
over
which
the
chariot
had
disappeared
but
it
had
gone
so
fast
that
it
had
passed
out
of
sight
over
another
range
of
hills
however
the
hoof
and
wheel
marks
were
plainly
shown
on
the
white
surface
of
the
cheese
so
she
went
on
and
on
following
the
tracks
until
just
as
she
was
beginning
to
despair
she
came
to
the
brow
of
a
hill
and
in
a
valley
beneath
she
saw
a
large
building
in
appearance
something
like
a
grecian
temple
except
that
instead
of
stone
it
was
made
of
cheese
in
front
of
the
building
was
a
large
heap
of
skins
of
various
animals
piled
up
so
high
that
they
made
a
sort
of
couch
on
which
the
goddess
was
lying
up
to
dinner
for
it
was
the
fashion
among
the
gods
to
lie
up
or
rather
down
instead
of
sitting
up
to
table
the
two
white
stags
which
had
been
harnessed
to
the
chariot
were
playfully
butting
at
each
other
with
their
golden
horns
and
the
chariot
itself
was
tilted
on
its
back
just
as
you
would
see
an
ordinary
cart
nowadays
but
the
princess
was
not
particularly
interested
in
tell
the
truth
she
was
feeling
remarkably
hungry
and
thirsty
for
she
had
been
already
for
some
hours
without
tasting
anything
at
all
i
wonder
if
i
m
invisible
to
the
gods
as
well
as
to
man
she
thought
i
ll
just
try
if
i
am
at
all
so
she
went
towards
the
goddess
who
was
eating
the
food
that
lay
on
the
table
in
front
of
the
couch
but
diana
did
not
appear
to
notice
her
and
she
advanced
more
boldly
until
she
was
quite
close
to
the
table
she
doesn
t
seem
to
have
much
variety
thought
the
princess
at
least
she
meant
to
think
do
you
think
so
said
diana
looking
up
in
some
astonishment
to
where
the
voice
came
from
and
who
asked
you
to
say
so
and
who
are
you
and
where
are
you
and
why
can
t
i
see
you
tell
me
or
i
ll
shoot
i
don
t
exactly
see
how
you
can
said
the
princess
the
goddess
seized
her
bow
and
looked
for
her
quiver
but
even
as
she
reached
out
her
hand
to
take
it
it
vanished
for
ernalie
was
too
fast
for
her
diana
looked
more
and
more
astonished
and
annoyed
who
are
you
she
said
are
you
a
mortal
certainly
i
am
said
ernalie
then
how
is
it
i
can
t
see
you
asked
the
goddess
because
of
the
feather
i
suppose
said
the
princess
you
don
t
mean
to
say
you
ve
got
the
feather
tell
me
how
you
got
it
the
princess
did
as
she
was
told
for
she
saw
no
use
in
making
the
goddess
angry
when
she
had
finished
diana
said
you
have
been
lucky
whoever
you
are
the
feather
belonged
to
one
of
jupiter
s
eagles
and
this
eagle
got
angry
and
flew
at
jove
because
he
gave
its
brother
eagle
more
than
its
share
of
food
so
he
banished
the
eagle
to
the
earth
and
it
got
shot
i
would
give
anything
for
the
but
i
wouldn
t
part
with
it
for
any
price
said
ernalie
i
ll
give
you
anything
you
like
for
it
you
know
said
the
goddess
but
i
won
t
part
with
it
said
ernalie
besides
i
ve
got
your
arrows
and
i
won
t
give
them
back
to
you
for
what
a
plague
you
are
what
do
you
want
for
the
arrows
first
you
must
promise
not
to
steal
the
feather
from
well
i
ll
promise
that
said
the
goddess
then
promise
not
to
do
me
any
very
and
lastly
take
me
safely
back
to
the
i
should
be
only
too
glad
if
you
had
never
come
near
me
said
the
goddess
however
i
promise
them
all
now
give
me
the
the
princess
gave
the
arrows
back
for
the
word
of
diana
was
not
to
be
doubted
i
wish
you
would
show
yourself
to
me
the
goddess
went
on
i
should
like
to
see
you
very
much
i
wonder
what
sort
of
a
person
you
are
do
show
so
the
princess
took
off
the
cap
in
which
she
wore
the
feather
but
as
soon
as
it
was
off
diana
vanished
for
you
see
it
was
the
feather
touching
her
head
that
gave
ernalie
the
power
of
seeing
without
being
seen
and
a
goddess
is
naturally
invisible
but
the
princess
did
not
think
of
that
it
must
be
some
trick
she
thought
so
she
put
the
feather
back
in
a
hurry
but
the
goddess
had
not
moved
she
was
smiling
quietly
can
t
you
trust
me
child
she
said
for
you
aren
t
much
more
than
a
child
you
i
m
grown
up
at
any
rate
said
the
princess
indignantly
i
m
nineteen
years
old
so
i
m
not
so
very
and
i
m
nineteen
thousand
years
old
said
the
goddess
and
i
don
t
look
so
very
old
do
i
you
certainly
don
t
but
then
you
see
you
re
a
goddess
and
i
m
a
mortal
and
it
makes
a
it
does
said
diana
but
do
show
yourself
to
me
but
if
i
make
myself
visible
you
disappear
said
ernalie
oh
i
had
forgotten
that
however
i
ll
make
myself
visible
so
when
ernalie
took
the
feather
away
this
time
diana
was
easily
visible
and
you
want
to
go
back
to
the
earth
do
you
asked
diana
i
do
very
much
answered
the
princess
and
why
because
the
moon
has
got
so
little
to
eat
on
really
said
the
goddess
there
s
plenty
of
cheese
isn
t
there
but
i
don
t
like
cheese
and
especially
green
cheese
i
hate
do
you
really
what
a
pity
it
is
you
re
not
a
mouse
said
the
goddess
but
i
m
not
said
ernalie
and
that
settles
she
might
offer
me
some
of
her
food
she
thought
to
herself
you
wouldn
t
be
able
to
eat
it
if
you
had
it
said
the
goddess
who
seemed
to
hear
what
she
thought
just
as
well
as
what
she
said
why
shouldn
t
i
asked
ernalie
because
it
s
ambrosia
and
if
you
once
ate
any
of
it
you
d
never
be
able
to
eat
any
other
kind
of
food
which
would
be
rather
awkward
for
why
asked
the
princess
you
re
always
asking
why
don
t
you
use
some
other
z
for
instance
it
gets
so
monotonous
now
tell
me
who
you
are
and
all
about
so
the
princess
did
as
she
was
told
it
would
never
do
to
offend
her
if
she
s
going
to
take
me
back
to
the
earth
she
thought
and
the
goddess
remarked
quite
when
she
had
finished
the
goddess
said
you
shouldn
t
have
interfered
with
the
fates
even
jupiter
daren
t
do
that
and
i
d
as
soon
go
near
them
as
i
would
pat
but
what
could
i
do
i
didn
t
want
wopole
to
kill
i
don
t
see
why
not
said
the
goddess
why
did
you
come
at
all
if
wopole
and
the
other
chose
to
fall
out
i
don
t
see
why
you
should
meddle
to
save
but
i
couldn
t
let
wopole
kill
why
not
asked
the
goddess
because
he
was
my
and
he
was
going
to
marry
me
and
i
m
sure
i
didn
t
want
my
husband
to
be
liable
to
drop
down
dead
at
any
the
goddess
looked
angry
at
this
why
shouldn
t
he
he
s
only
a
man
and
i
hate
vulgar
things
and
you
were
going
to
marry
him
if
i
d
known
that
i
d
never
have
spoken
a
word
to
you
don
t
you
know
i
m
the
goddess
of
chastity
and
i
ve
sworn
never
to
marry
the
sooner
you
go
the
but
i
can
t
go
i
ve
got
nowhere
to
go
to
and
besides
you
promised
to
take
me
back
to
the
earth
said
ernalie
i
suppose
i
did
said
the
goddess
besides
i
don
t
want
to
have
you
always
here
well
the
moon
will
begin
to
rise
in
half
an
hour
and
then
i
ll
take
you
in
my
chariot
that
s
the
only
thing
to
do
so
you
can
help
me
to
harness
the
this
was
soon
done
and
the
goddess
went
into
the
house
to
put
away
the
remains
of
the
food
on
which
she
had
been
dining
when
she
came
out
again
ernalie
noticed
that
she
had
made
a
considerable
change
in
her
costume
what
the
change
was
i
don
t
exactly
know
but
she
said
to
ernalie
you
see
i
have
to
dress
lightly
to
follow
the
chase
easily
however
if
you
re
ready
i
so
saying
she
slung
her
quiver
full
of
arrows
over
her
back
and
taking
the
silver
bow
in
her
hand
got
into
the
chariot
get
up
she
said
to
ernalie
for
the
stags
were
already
pawing
the
ground
in
their
eagerness
to
be
off
ernalie
jumped
in
quickly
and
the
stags
darted
off
at
an
immense
pace
they
went
so
smoothly
however
that
the
princess
was
not
at
all
shaken
or
jolted
on
over
hills
and
through
valleys
until
it
almost
made
her
head
swim
at
the
way
in
which
the
scenery
shot
past
however
in
a
few
minutes
the
roar
of
the
waves
sounded
in
her
ears
and
they
came
over
the
to
the
just
then
the
goddess
drew
the
reins
in
and
the
stags
stopped
short
what
on
earth
is
that
she
said
now
that
the
chariot
had
stopped
the
princess
too
could
hear
the
sound
that
came
faintly
borne
on
the
breeze
when
moonlight
o
er
the
azure
why
it
s
the
man
she
said
so
it
is
said
diana
angrily
i
recognise
his
voice
he
calls
it
it
s
dreadful
i
told
him
never
to
sing
unless
he
had
somebody
to
sing
to
of
course
i
thought
no
one
would
ever
come
to
the
moon
i
wonder
whom
he
s
singing
to
i
rather
imagine
he
thinks
he
s
singing
to
me
said
the
princess
hesitatingly
i
begged
him
not
to
sing
but
he
insisted
so
i
ran
away
and
i
suppose
he
thinks
i
m
still
there
for
you
see
he
can
t
see
oh
he
thinks
you
re
still
there
does
he
said
diana
just
make
yourself
invisible
and
i
ll
do
the
same
and
we
ll
go
a
little
the
princess
did
as
she
was
told
and
diana
urged
the
stags
in
the
direction
of
the
voice
the
rattling
of
the
wheels
was
quite
drowned
in
the
noise
of
the
man
s
voice
as
he
sang
and
you
ll
remember
me
e
e
and
you
ll
remember
you
ve
improved
a
good
deal
in
that
last
line
said
the
goddess
i
wish
you
d
sing
it
over
you
there
then
said
the
man
i
thought
you
had
gone
away
i
couldn
t
get
you
to
answer
when
i
spoke
to
ah
that
was
because
i
was
too
enchanted
for
words
to
express
now
sing
the
last
line
again
only
the
last
line
it
so
fine
said
diana
the
man
drew
in
a
long
breath
and
you
ll
remember
re
member
me
e
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
the
princess
put
her
hands
to
her
ears
and
diana
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
keeping
the
stags
from
turning
tail
and
bolting
right
away
however
she
managed
to
quieten
them
and
took
a
good
grip
of
her
whip
handle
and
the
consequence
was
that
the
last
line
came
out
and
you
ll
remember
me
e
for
the
whip
stung
a
good
deal
i
hope
you
ll
remember
said
the
goddess
calmly
as
she
suddenly
appeared
to
him
turning
the
chariot
towards
the
sea
you
don
t
mind
getting
a
little
wet
she
continued
turning
to
the
princess
we
re
going
over
the
and
she
gave
the
reins
to
the
stags
who
sprang
wildly
down
the
steep
slope
into
the
sea
for
a
moment
the
princess
thought
that
there
might
be
rather
too
much
of
a
good
thing
even
if
that
good
thing
were
riding
in
a
chariot
along
with
a
goddess
for
the
chariot
plunged
deep
into
a
high
wave
and
it
seemed
to
the
princess
as
if
it
never
did
intend
to
come
to
the
surface
again
however
it
did
come
up
and
that
was
some
comfort
although
the
princess
was
dripping
all
over
with
the
but
the
stags
were
once
more
darting
onwards
for
the
chariot
ran
as
lightly
over
the
waves
as
over
the
land
and
they
went
at
such
a
rate
that
although
the
great
breakers
chased
them
and
even
curled
right
over
them
they
were
never
so
much
as
touched
by
the
spray
that
the
wind
blew
from
off
the
crests
of
the
waves
so
they
dashed
on
through
the
blue
water
that
coiled
up
over
the
front
of
the
chariot
but
fell
back
when
it
saw
the
goddess
on
and
on
they
went
and
as
they
got
farther
out
the
waves
became
steeper
and
steeper
until
it
seemed
as
if
they
were
going
over
very
mountainous
land
indeed
for
they
rose
over
every
wave
suddenly
the
goddess
said
this
is
a
little
too
much
and
drew
the
stags
in
the
great
waves
rolled
on
like
angry
hounds
hungering
for
their
prey
but
the
goddess
motioned
with
her
hand
down
down
she
cried
know
ye
me
and
the
waves
sank
like
hounds
to
whom
their
master
shows
his
whip
and
instantly
it
fell
a
deep
calm
over
the
whole
sea
then
the
goddess
lashed
on
the
deer
again
and
once
more
they
sped
on
over
the
sea
and
the
chariot
wheels
cut
two
deep
white
furrows
in
the
deep
blue
and
in
the
moonlight
ernalie
could
see
the
two
straight
white
lines
glistening
right
away
to
the
they
went
so
quickly
that
there
was
no
time
for
the
foam
to
die
away
before
it
was
out
of
sight
so
they
kept
on
for
a
long
while
and
gradually
the
moon
rose
in
the
sky
and
then
fell
lower
and
lower
and
still
they
journeyed
on
then
the
moon
set
the
stars
gradually
faded
from
sight
and
the
hot
rays
of
the
morning
sun
began
to
turn
the
eastern
sky
yellow
suddenly
the
goddess
pulled
up
the
stags
there
s
the
land
she
said
pointing
to
a
low
blue
line
on
the
horizon
we
must
rise
into
the
air
now
for
we
are
getting
near
the
place
where
ships
ply
to
and
fro
on
the
sea
and
if
the
sailors
saw
the
two
white
trails
of
the
chariot
wheels
they
would
say
it
was
the
and
i
don
t
want
to
be
called
a
s
most
insulting
so
if
you
re
inclined
to
be
giddy
you
d
better
sit
in
the
bottom
of
the
but
the
princess
said
oh
no
i
m
never
giddy
however
great
the
height
may
so
diana
gave
the
word
to
the
stags
and
they
began
to
rise
from
the
water
in
a
spiral
line
upwards
as
an
eagle
soars
in
chase
of
a
swan
when
they
had
reached
a
sufficiently
great
height
the
goddess
once
more
let
loose
the
reins
and
the
deer
bounded
forward
again
like
an
arrow
released
from
a
bow
swiftly
they
neared
the
land
but
from
where
they
were
nothing
could
be
seen
of
the
things
on
it
everything
was
blurred
into
one
mass
as
if
it
had
been
a
map
spread
out
below
them
so
they
sped
on
again
for
a
time
and
the
fresh
morning
air
blew
cool
on
ernalie
s
face
and
almost
made
her
shiver
though
by
this
time
her
garments
were
dry
again
and
blew
out
like
a
cloud
behind
her
as
if
they
had
been
of
thin
gauze
though
they
were
really
of
far
thicker
and
heavier
material
suddenly
a
thought
struck
ernalie
where
are
you
going
to
take
me
she
asked
as
well
as
she
could
for
the
wind
blew
her
words
down
her
throat
the
goddess
smiled
somewhat
maliciously
ernalie
thought
and
checked
the
course
of
the
stags
that
she
might
speak
with
greater
ease
you
shall
see
she
said
but
i
should
like
to
know
i
only
promised
to
take
you
back
to
the
earth
said
diana
but
you
promised
to
do
me
no
harm
said
ernalie
dismally
and
if
you
leave
me
in
the
middle
of
a
desert
you
ll
do
me
a
lot
of
but
i
m
not
going
to
put
you
down
into
the
middle
of
a
desert
said
diana
look
we
are
descending
now
see
if
you
recognise
the
country
you
pass
the
princess
looked
over
the
edge
of
the
chariot
and
she
saw
that
the
stags
were
descending
in
great
spiral
curves
and
at
each
curve
the
earth
flew
up
nearer
and
nearer
to
meet
them
as
they
got
lower
down
ernalie
could
see
what
was
below
more
clearly
as
if
she
had
been
looking
through
an
opera
glass
and
was
only
just
commencing
to
get
the
right
focus
when
they
were
quite
close
the
goddess
stopped
the
descent
of
the
chariot
now
do
you
recognise
where
you
are
she
asked
but
ernalie
shook
her
head
i
only
see
that
we
are
over
the
tops
of
a
range
of
mountains
that
have
snow
on
their
peaks
she
said
but
i
was
never
here
i
am
quite
certain
the
goddess
shook
the
reins
and
again
the
stags
flew
forward
but
this
time
not
so
fast
as
they
had
gone
before
you
have
been
here
before
she
said
and
at
just
this
height
and
at
just
this
speed
only
you
were
going
in
the
opposite
why
said
ernalie
i
must
be
in
my
own
country
oh
how
cruel
of
you
to
take
me
away
from
my
prince
and
you
promised
to
do
me
no
i
am
doing
you
no
harm
said
the
goddess
to
prevent
you
marrying
is
not
is
but
the
princess
said
no
no
it
is
harm
i
would
give
anything
to
be
back
with
would
you
give
your
feather
said
the
goddess
eagerly
no
not
that
said
the
princess
i
will
give
you
anything
you
like
for
it
said
the
goddess
but
the
princess
said
scornfully
not
so
goddess
i
will
get
back
to
my
love
in
spite
of
you
if
i
can
do
nothing
better
i
will
pray
to
venus
and
offer
her
the
the
goddess
looked
angrily
at
her
and
it
almost
seemed
as
if
her
eyes
shot
fire
if
it
were
not
for
my
promise
she
said
i
would
hurl
you
from
the
car
but
as
it
is
i
will
put
you
safely
but
the
princess
smiled
in
spite
of
herself
do
you
then
hate
venus
so
much
great
goddess
she
asked
well
you
have
really
done
me
much
good
and
therefore
i
promise
never
to
give
the
feather
to
any
other
goddess
save
you
diana
looked
very
much
relieved
for
to
tell
the
truth
the
goddesses
in
those
days
were
very
jealous
of
one
another
and
diana
could
not
bear
the
thought
that
any
one
else
should
have
the
feather
if
she
could
not
get
it
so
for
a
few
minutes
she
was
silent
and
then
suddenly
she
drew
in
the
stags
i
am
going
to
set
you
down
here
she
said
and
they
plunged
into
the
darkness
below
for
you
must
know
that
though
they
were
high
up
and
the
rays
of
the
sun
still
below
the
horizon
fell
on
them
yet
beneath
them
everything
was
dark
in
the
shadow
of
the
mountains
the
chariot
sank
slowly
until
it
rested
on
the
ground
but
it
was
still
so
dark
that
the
princess
could
see
nothing
get
out
said
diana
you
are
quite
safe
and
the
princess
obeyed
now
remember
the
goddess
went
on
i
have
kept
my
promises
remember
to
keep
yours
give
the
feather
to
no
one
except
to
me
unless
i
send
iris
for
it
to
her
alone
give
it
for
she
is
the
messenger
of
the
the
princess
once
more
promised
and
diana
shook
the
reins
and
the
chariot
once
more
darted
up
through
the
air
and
out
of
the
lower
darkness
into
the
sunlight
until
it
was
so
high
that
it
vanished
altogether
from
her
sight
so
the
princess
looked
wearily
down
again
and
the
earth
around
her
seemed
doubly
dark
by
contrast
i
wonder
where
on
earth
i
am
she
said
and
then
she
took
two
or
three
steps
forward
but
she
came
against
a
stone
parapet
or
wall
or
something
i
wonder
what
this
is
she
said
to
herself
i
think
i
shall
stop
where
i
am
till
daylight
it
won
t
be
very
long
now
and
i
m
safe
here
at
any
so
she
leant
on
the
wall
and
waited
but
even
though
the
dawn
was
near
it
seemed
long
in
coming
but
presently
over
the
mountains
in
the
east
a
yellow
light
stole
changing
the
silence
of
darkness
for
the
clamorous
speech
of
light
and
the
river
flowing
placidly
in
front
was
turned
to
liquid
gold
with
the
yellow
of
the
dawn
and
a
sense
of
gray
mist
was
on
everything
and
forms
erstwhile
veiled
discovered
themselves
why
wherever
am
i
said
ernalie
rubbing
her
eyes
in
astonishment
i
seem
to
have
been
here
before
yes
there
s
the
fountain
and
the
this
must
be
the
terrace
of
my
father
s
palace
just
where
i
was
when
the
eagle
carried
me
off
i
wonder
if
the
swans
are
still
here
and
she
walked
to
the
other
side
of
the
terrace
and
looked
over
the
marble
parapet
into
the
water
yes
there
they
and
on
the
marble
steps
that
led
down
to
the
water
the
swans
were
asleep
each
on
one
leg
with
its
neck
coiled
up
on
its
back
and
head
under
its
wing
on
hearing
the
footsteps
of
the
princess
one
of
them
looked
lazily
up
as
if
it
had
been
waked
too
soon
and
then
it
shook
its
head
yawned
put
down
its
other
leg
and
waddled
slowly
to
the
water
into
which
it
jumped
with
a
splash
that
woke
the
others
up
and
they
followed
dreamily
being
unused
to
the
chill
of
the
water
so
early
a
cock
crowed
and
his
challenge
was
answered
from
far
and
near
and
woke
up
the
sparrows
who
came
down
to
the
fountain
for
a
in
the
sparkling
spray
they
were
followed
by
the
pigeons
who
after
cooing
a
little
stretched
their
wings
and
circled
away
on
their
morning
flight
so
by
degrees
the
world
awoke
as
the
day
took
a
firmer
grasp
on
the
land
and
the
light
grew
stronger
i
wish
they
d
open
the
doors
and
let
me
get
in
the
princess
said
but
as
yet
there
seemed
no
sign
of
any
one
waking
up
ah
well
she
said
resignedly
i
ve
waited
six
years
to
come
suppose
i
can
wait
a
few
more
so
she
quietly
walked
to
the
and
plucked
one
or
two
of
the
great
red
damask
roses
and
chafing
the
petals
off
between
her
hands
threw
the
handfuls
of
them
at
the
swans
who
hissed
and
snapped
as
the
mass
of
red
leaves
fell
over
them
it
was
some
time
since
they
had
been
subjected
to
such
treatment
however
they
seemed
to
get
used
to
it
again
pretty
easily
thus
the
princess
managed
to
while
away
about
half
an
hour
and
then
she
noticed
smoke
coming
out
of
one
of
the
chimneys
they
must
be
up
in
the
kitchen
she
thought
i
ll
just
go
and
knock
at
the
door
and
get
let
accordingly
she
went
and
knocked
softly
at
the
door
and
an
angry
voice
shouted
out
come
in
do
and
don
t
stand
knocking
there
i
ve
got
the
king
s
boots
to
black
and
his
eggs
and
bacon
to
cook
and
i
ve
only
got
three
hours
to
do
it
in
i
haven
t
got
so
the
princess
lifted
the
latch
and
walked
in
is
the
king
up
cook
she
asked
no
he
s
not
lazy
old
man
as
he
is
said
the
cook
looking
up
angrily
but
where
are
you
come
out
from
behind
that
oh
i
had
forgotten
said
the
princess
she
meant
of
course
she
had
forgotten
about
the
feather
but
the
cook
didn
t
know
that
you
d
forgotten
had
you
she
exclaimed
i
ll
teach
you
to
forget
if
i
catch
you
but
you
won
t
my
dear
cook
said
the
princess
sweetly
you
ll
catch
it
if
you
don
t
look
out
howled
the
cook
as
she
rose
from
the
floor
where
she
had
been
cleaning
the
boots
and
in
doing
so
she
knocked
over
an
enormous
pot
of
liquid
blacking
that
s
your
doing
she
cried
as
she
made
a
dash
at
the
door
but
the
princess
evaded
her
easily
and
she
ran
outside
fully
expecting
to
find
the
invisible
questioner
there
but
the
princess
meanwhile
walked
through
the
kitchen
and
up
the
to
her
own
room
the
room
was
just
as
she
had
left
it
when
she
went
away
except
that
the
bed
seemed
to
have
grown
rather
small
for
her
or
rather
she
had
grown
too
large
for
the
bed
however
she
went
in
and
locking
the
door
laid
herself
down
on
the
bed
and
soon
dropped
off
to
sleep
for
as
you
may
imagine
she
was
rather
tired
for
she
had
not
slept
for
nearly
two
is
ever
since
she
had
first
reached
the
moon
it
did
not
seem
that
she
had
slept
three
minutes
before
she
was
awakened
by
a
tremendous
noise
i
wonder
what
that
is
she
said
i
think
i
ll
get
up
and
and
she
went
to
the
stand
to
wash
the
off
her
face
but
the
soap
from
long
want
of
use
had
cracked
in
all
directions
and
she
had
to
content
herself
with
the
water
that
was
in
the
jug
then
she
brushed
her
hair
which
was
full
of
salt
and
after
that
tried
to
brush
the
salt
off
her
dress
for
the
had
dried
on
it
and
had
left
it
shining
all
over
with
the
salt
before
she
had
quite
finished
however
the
noise
that
had
waked
her
sounded
again
it
seemed
as
if
some
one
were
running
downstairs
very
hard
so
the
princess
took
her
hat
off
not
wishing
to
be
invisible
any
more
for
a
time
at
least
and
then
opening
the
door
she
walked
quietly
downstairs
there
seemed
to
be
no
one
about
and
except
that
a
terrible
proceeded
from
the
whereabouts
of
the
kitchen
one
would
never
have
told
that
any
one
in
the
whole
house
was
awake
however
just
then
the
clock
in
the
hall
struck
eight
and
a
page
came
rushing
downstairs
breakfast
breakfast
he
shouted
quite
without
noticing
the
princess
and
he
almost
passed
her
before
he
saw
her
but
she
stopped
him
where
is
the
king
she
said
the
king
is
in
his
is
i
mean
the
but
you
can
t
see
but
i
must
said
the
princess
well
of
course
if
you
the
princess
interrupted
him
don
t
you
know
who
i
am
she
said
no
i
don
t
and
i
don
t
want
to
said
the
page
perhaps
you
re
the
person
who
brings
home
the
washing
or
the
if
you
are
i
wouldn
t
like
to
be
in
your
shoes
the
king
is
so
jolly
wild
about
his
eggs
and
bacon
being
late
but
the
princess
didn
t
wait
to
hear
any
more
she
walked
straight
towards
the
door
of
the
at
the
door
two
guards
were
stationed
but
as
they
were
old
and
is
remembered
the
princess
and
only
saluted
with
their
swords
wishing
her
they
were
far
too
well
bred
to
express
surprise
or
joy
at
sight
of
her
one
of
them
opened
the
door
for
her
and
said
in
a
loud
voice
the
princess
your
the
king
was
seated
in
a
chair
with
his
back
to
the
door
and
did
not
seem
to
hear
what
the
man
said
he
only
nodded
and
did
not
look
up
from
the
papers
he
was
reading
so
the
princess
stole
quietly
up
behind
him
and
put
her
fingers
over
his
always
was
rather
irreverent
guess
who
i
am
she
said
to
the
struggling
monarch
i
won
t
he
spluttered
for
he
was
rather
enraged
think
a
minute
papa
she
said
encouragingly
i
never
should
have
thought
of
being
assaulted
in
such
a
way
said
the
king
who
had
given
up
struggling
finding
it
no
use
so
the
princess
drew
her
hands
away
and
kissed
him
on
the
top
of
his
bald
head
the
king
darted
away
out
of
the
chair
as
soon
as
he
was
released
and
that
so
violently
that
he
fell
right
on
to
the
floor
in
a
sitting
posture
why
who
he
was
beginning
but
his
eye
happening
to
fall
on
ernalie
he
ejaculated
good
gracious
how
did
you
come
here
i
walked
downstairs
from
my
room
to
bid
you
papa
and
you
recoiled
when
i
touched
you
as
if
i
were
a
snake
instead
of
your
loving
daughter
but
wouldn
t
you
like
me
to
help
you
up
it
must
be
rather
uncomfortable
sitting
yes
i
think
it
would
be
as
well
the
king
said
after
reflecting
a
moment
i
shouldn
t
like
any
one
to
see
me
in
such
a
s
rather
undignified
for
a
so
the
princess
bent
over
and
began
to
help
him
up
but
it
was
a
labour
of
some
time
for
the
king
was
rather
stiff
and
just
as
she
had
got
him
half
up
a
page
entered
and
announced
the
breakfast
it
was
the
same
page
that
had
met
the
princess
on
the
staircase
and
when
he
saw
the
princess
assisting
the
king
to
rise
he
rushed
forward
shouting
help
help
she
s
murdering
the
and
catching
the
princess
by
the
arm
he
pulled
her
away
so
roughly
that
she
had
to
let
go
of
the
king
who
recoiled
at
the
shock
and
rolled
under
the
table
on
his
back
alarmed
at
the
page
s
cries
for
help
a
large
number
of
people
had
rushed
in
and
he
turned
to
them
expecting
to
be
commended
for
his
bravery
but
he
saw
that
every
one
either
looked
as
if
he
had
put
his
foot
in
it
or
else
was
trying
hard
not
to
laugh
the
princess
herself
could
hardly
help
laughing
at
his
perplexed
face
i
think
sir
you
were
a
little
too
vigorous
in
your
help
she
said
coldly
you
may
leave
us
and
you
can
all
go
said
the
king
from
under
the
table
the
whole
lot
trooped
out
shutting
the
door
and
as
soon
as
they
were
outside
shouts
of
laughter
filled
the
air
for
some
minutes
the
king
meanwhile
scrambled
out
from
under
the
table
and
got
up
this
time
declining
his
daughter
s
help
it
s
always
the
way
he
said
as
soon
as
the
laughter
had
died
away
whenever
i
do
anything
ridiculous
and
undignified
there
s
always
a
lot
of
people
to
see
it
why
only
last
last
tuesday
i
it
was
the
day
of
the
last
state
banquet
my
crown
tumbled
into
the
and
then
i
was
so
nervous
that
when
i
was
raising
my
to
propose
a
toast
my
hand
shook
so
much
that
i
dropped
the
wine
down
the
duchess
of
carabas
s
neck
and
then
she
fainted
and
i
helped
to
carry
her
out
of
the
room
and
as
soon
as
i
got
outside
they
all
laughed
so
loud
that
the
chandelier
fell
into
the
middle
of
them
it
broke
right
on
a
duke
s
head
and
he
never
apologised
for
breaking
it
however
i
shall
get
over
it
now
you
ve
come
back
we
really
must
get
into
more
regular
habits
i
ve
actually
never
had
more
than
ten
pages
to
serve
my
breakfast
since
you
ve
been
away
and
by
the
bye
we
ve
not
breakfast
and
i
ve
forgotten
altogether
to
have
the
bells
rung
in
your
honour
just
knock
that
gong
there
on
the
s
cracked
but
i
can
t
afford
a
new
one
and
it
s
quite
good
enough
for
the
guards
outside
to
so
the
princess
knocked
the
gong
and
it
certainly
cracked
it
sounded
a
good
deal
more
like
knocking
an
old
pot
than
a
respectable
royal
gong
at
the
sound
one
of
the
guards
outside
entered
and
saluted
let
the
breakfast
be
brought
the
king
said
the
guard
withdrew
and
presently
the
door
opened
and
a
page
appeared
with
the
royal
on
a
cushion
of
cloth
of
gold
next
came
another
page
with
the
on
a
similar
cushion
and
then
another
with
the
and
another
with
the
sugar
and
another
with
the
tongs
until
the
table
was
completely
furnished
last
of
all
came
with
a
loud
fanfare
of
trumpets
four
men
staggering
under
the
weight
of
an
enormous
silver
dish
with
an
equally
enormous
silver
cover
when
this
was
placed
on
the
table
amid
another
flourish
of
trumpets
the
royal
butler
entered
and
said
breakfast
is
served
your
majesty
although
the
king
could
see
it
very
well
himself
but
that
was
the
custom
you
may
remove
the
cover
the
king
said
and
the
butler
did
so
discovering
the
breakfast
i
say
discovering
for
the
breakfast
was
so
small
that
it
seemed
almost
lost
in
the
centre
of
the
great
dish
the
twelve
pages
had
ranged
themselves
in
lines
of
six
on
each
side
of
the
table
and
although
they
were
very
well
bred
on
the
whole
they
could
not
help
smiling
whereupon
all
simultaneously
drew
out
their
handkerchiefs
and
began
to
cough
and
then
they
looked
at
the
windows
as
if
to
see
where
the
draught
came
from
but
the
king
did
not
take
any
notice
and
as
soon
as
he
could
make
himself
heard
he
said
ah
and
what
is
this
it
is
the
breakfast
your
majesty
said
the
butler
yes
i
can
see
that
said
the
king
but
what
is
the
dish
called
oh
the
dish
your
majesty
said
the
butler
apologetically
it
s
the
ordinary
silver
dish
that
your
majesty
has
with
the
breakfast
i
think
it
s
the
fiddle
that
s
for
spoons
you
re
an
ass
said
the
king
interrupting
him
angrily
thank
you
your
majesty
anything
else
send
for
the
yes
your
majesty
anything
else
yes
go
away
and
don
t
come
yes
your
majesty
you
re
quite
sure
there
s
if
you
don
t
go
said
the
king
threateningly
but
he
had
gone
in
a
few
minutes
heavy
footsteps
were
heard
outside
and
the
door
burst
open
violently
and
a
very
fat
person
entered
she
seemed
a
perfect
mass
of
blacking
and
dust
who
are
you
said
the
king
in
astonishment
i
am
the
lady
that
does
the
cooking
for
you
said
the
cook
solemnly
oh
you
are
said
the
king
and
will
your
ladyship
allow
me
to
ask
what
that
is
and
he
pointed
to
the
breakfast
the
cook
went
forward
and
taking
a
fork
from
the
table
tried
to
pick
the
breakfast
up
but
it
slid
off
the
fork
so
without
more
ado
she
took
it
up
in
her
fingers
and
examined
it
carefully
as
if
to
see
that
it
had
not
changed
since
she
sent
it
up
when
she
had
done
she
looked
up
and
said
why
it
s
as
nice
an
egg
as
can
be
bought
for
money
only
it
s
a
bit
addled
and
i
dropped
it
in
the
blacking
but
i
wiped
it
on
my
own
and
she
lifted
up
her
apron
to
look
at
and
it
certainly
looked
as
if
a
good
many
eggs
had
been
wiped
on
it
however
the
king
did
not
notice
that
oh
it
s
an
egg
is
it
he
said
i
didn
t
know
i
thought
it
was
a
piece
of
coal
but
at
this
point
the
cook
broke
in
call
my
eggs
a
coal
it
s
a
crying
shame
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
an
old
man
like
you
too
here
have
i
been
working
for
three
hours
this
very
morning
at
that
egg
and
he
calls
it
a
coal
and
me
that
plagued
too
with
demons
why
only
this
morning
one
of
em
came
and
banged
at
the
door
so
hard
that
it
broke
and
then
it
came
in
it
was
a
blue
one
with
red
eyes
and
a
long
green
tail
with
a
fork
at
the
end
and
it
stuck
the
fork
in
the
egg
and
then
put
the
egg
in
the
blacking
and
threw
it
all
over
the
kitchen
and
then
it
kicked
the
blacking
pot
over
and
flew
out
at
the
door
before
i
could
say
gemini
and
i
saw
it
with
my
own
eyes
and
it
was
as
ugly
a
but
this
was
more
than
the
princess
could
stand
oh
what
untruth
that
is
look
at
me
am
i
a
blue
demon
with
red
eyes
and
a
tail
but
the
cook
was
off
again
oh
it
was
you
was
it
and
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
a
poor
woman
call
yourself
a
princess
i
call
you
this
was
too
much
for
the
king
that
is
enough
he
said
take
a
month
s
to
which
the
cook
replied
contemptuously
you
give
a
month
s
warning
not
a
bit
of
it
i
give
you
a
minute
s
warning
it
s
quite
enough
for
the
likes
of
oh
very
well
said
the
king
of
course
if
you
go
off
without
warning
i
don
t
pay
your
month
s
call
yourself
a
king
roared
the
cook
why
you
re
meaner
i
don
t
know
what
i
call
myself
said
the
king
mildly
but
if
you
don
t
go
i
ll
call
a
policeman
and
have
your
head
cut
off
instead
of
your
but
the
cook
was
not
to
be
daunted
that
s
what
the
likes
of
you
does
with
your
old
and
faithful
servants
here
have
i
been
day
in
day
out
work
work
work
like
a
nigger
and
this
is
my
reward
the
king
did
not
listen
to
the
rest
he
beckoned
to
one
of
the
pages
and
said
just
run
and
bring
a
sack
and
throw
it
over
her
head
be
quick
the
page
left
the
room
there
you
go
said
the
irrepressible
cook
that
s
it
send
for
the
police
ye
oppressors
of
the
poor
ugh
and
she
began
a
fresh
volley
of
abuse
she
seemed
as
if
she
would
never
lose
her
breath
but
after
a
few
seemed
ages
to
the
unfortunate
page
returned
and
although
he
did
not
enter
very
quietly
yet
the
cook
was
making
such
a
noise
that
she
did
not
hear
him
and
the
page
who
seemed
to
enter
entirely
into
the
spirit
of
the
thing
dropped
the
sack
quietly
over
her
head
and
stopped
her
flow
of
language
now
take
her
outside
and
put
her
out
at
the
back
door
and
mind
and
shut
the
door
securely
after
her
remarked
the
king
with
a
sigh
of
relief
six
of
the
pages
immediately
caught
hold
of
her
and
dragged
her
out
and
the
other
six
were
about
to
follow
to
see
the
sport
when
the
king
stopped
them
can
any
one
of
you
cook
at
all
he
said
one
of
the
pages
stood
out
and
professed
to
be
able
to
do
a
little
in
that
way
well
then
said
the
king
decidedly
all
six
of
you
go
to
the
kitchen
and
see
what
you
can
find
there
and
mind
you
if
i
don
t
have
a
breakfast
in
five
minutes
i
see
about
when
the
pages
had
gone
he
turned
to
the
princess
and
said
that
s
what
i
always
have
to
put
up
with
only
the
other
day
the
man
who
cleans
the
library
windows
flung
his
towel
in
my
face
and
refused
to
work
any
more
for
me
and
all
because
i
told
him
that
his
coat
wasn
t
in
the
but
wasn
t
that
rather
an
unwise
proceeding
papa
asked
ernalie
dubiously
do
you
think
so
asked
the
king
if
i
said
that
the
cut
of
your
dress
was
rather
it
is
by
the
wouldn
t
fling
something
at
me
would
you
no
but
then
i
m
your
dutiful
daughter
you
well
but
he
ought
to
be
my
dutiful
son
for
i
m
the
father
of
my
well
but
then
you
see
sons
are
not
always
always
or
they
ought
to
be
said
his
majesty
it
s
the
same
thing
isn
t
it
do
you
think
so
said
the
king
in
a
tone
that
showed
he
doubted
it
just
at
this
moment
the
pages
entered
bringing
the
breakfast
and
they
sat
down
to
it
i
needn
t
say
it
was
much
better
than
the
first
one
although
i
don
t
remember
exactly
what
it
consisted
of
however
they
did
good
justice
to
it
for
ernalie
was
rather
hungry
just
as
they
had
finished
the
king
threw
down
his
knife
and
fork
and
looked
as
if
he
had
just
remembered
something
dreadful
what
is
the
matter
papa
asked
the
princess
in
alarm
and
the
king
burst
out
there
now
i
knew
i
d
forgotten
something
he
said
run
out
all
six
of
you
he
went
on
addressing
the
pages
and
set
the
pealing
and
send
messengers
throughout
the
land
quick
but
when
they
had
gone
he
calmed
down
and
said
now
ernalie
tell
me
where
you
ve
so
she
began
and
told
it
all
through
and
the
king
listened
quietly
till
she
had
finished
then
he
said
ah
you
ve
had
some
wonderful
adventures
and
you
ve
come
back
safe
out
of
i
should
very
much
like
to
see
this
wonderful
so
the
princess
showed
him
the
feather
in
her
hat
which
she
had
laid
on
a
chair
the
king
looked
at
it
very
carefully
and
then
he
said
h
m
looks
a
very
ordinary
feather
how
does
it
work
i
should
like
to
you
won
t
see
much
said
the
princess
with
a
smile
as
she
put
it
on
and
vanished
the
king
looked
astonished
why
where
are
you
he
said
i
m
just
where
i
was
before
papa
answered
the
princess
but
i
don
t
believe
it
the
king
said
and
he
looked
under
the
table
you
ve
hidden
yourself
behind
some
other
he
was
rather
too
startled
to
think
of
what
his
words
meant
exactly
you
are
a
sceptical
old
papa
for
any
one
to
have
to
do
with
but
i
ll
soon
prove
it
to
and
she
walked
quietly
behind
his
chair
and
blew
in
his
ear
which
was
a
rather
rude
thing
to
do
on
the
whole
perhaps
that
will
blow
the
disbelief
out
of
your
head
she
said
laughing
to
see
how
her
unfortunate
father
shook
his
head
in
surprise
oh
yes
he
replied
i
m
quite
convinced
and
i
don
t
need
any
more
and
i
d
much
rather
see
what
you
re
up
to
so
just
take
the
feather
off
there
s
a
good
and
the
princess
did
as
she
was
told
and
the
king
said
ah
there
you
are
don
t
put
it
on
again
i
ve
had
quite
enough
of
it
now
i
can
understand
how
it
was
that
you
did
it
all
but
i
can
t
understand
why
you
didn
t
let
the
young
man
save
himself
you
might
just
as
well
have
lent
him
the
feather
and
let
him
go
and
get
but
i
didn
t
want
him
to
get
drowned
said
the
princess
why
not
said
the
king
because
his
father
and
mother
took
me
in
and
saved
me
from
wopole
and
it
wouldn
t
have
been
a
great
return
for
their
kindness
to
let
their
only
son
be
killed
and
besides
but
her
royal
highness
stopped
you
what
said
her
father
i
mean
and
she
stopped
again
oh
it
s
him
this
time
is
it
what
s
the
matter
with
you
he
said
in
astonishment
you
don
t
mean
to
say
that
you
re
in
love
with
one
another
now
i
call
that
too
bad
here
have
i
promised
you
to
three
dukes
and
you
ve
gone
and
fallen
in
love
with
a
prince
now
i
shall
have
no
end
of
a
nuisance
with
i
won
t
marry
them
at
any
rate
said
ernalie
energetically
i
don
t
want
you
to
marry
s
quite
enough
at
a
but
i
won
t
marry
one
of
them
and
i
m
the
principal
person
concerned
and
the
princess
began
to
cry
and
that
of
course
softened
the
heart
of
her
father
there
there
he
said
as
if
he
were
soothing
a
baby
don
t
cry
you
shall
marry
the
prince
if
you
can
get
it
s
rather
awkward
for
me
i
can
t
tell
the
dukes
that
you
re
engaged
to
a
prince
that
can
t
be
got
at
i
m
afraid
the
only
thing
to
do
will
be
to
have
all
their
heads
cut
off
that
ll
keep
them
quiet
at
any
rate
if
i
were
you
i
d
send
this
young
man
a
letter
to
tell
him
where
you
but
i
m
afraid
it
wouldn
t
reach
him
said
the
princess
then
i
don
t
see
what
s
to
be
done
said
the
king
perplexedly
however
i
shall
give
a
grand
ball
and
if
i
were
you
i
should
go
and
have
a
dress
made
at
once
send
for
the
court
dressmaker
and
tell
her
that
if
the
dress
isn
t
ready
by
then
you
ll
turn
her
out
of
her
place
and
then
when
you
ve
done
that
go
into
the
library
and
take
a
book
and
read
i
ve
got
a
whole
lot
of
work
to
do
this
morning
but
i
shall
have
finished
by
one
and
then
i
shall
have
the
day
to
but
can
t
i
stay
with
you
while
you
work
i
will
be
very
but
the
king
shook
his
head
s
a
good
girl
i
ve
got
a
whole
lot
of
people
to
give
audience
to
and
they
ll
take
up
such
a
lot
of
time
congratulating
you
that
i
shall
not
get
a
stroke
of
work
so
the
princess
went
and
was
measured
for
her
and
then
into
the
library
and
looked
about
for
a
book
most
of
them
looked
very
dry
and
uninteresting
so
the
princess
took
one
at
a
venture
it
was
called
canterbury
by
geoffrey
chaucer
chaucer
said
the
princess
to
herself
i
ve
heard
of
him
i
ll
just
take
it
on
to
the
terrace
and
read
it
in
the
arbour
it
s
better
than
sitting
in
this
stuffy
old
so
she
opened
one
of
the
windows
that
led
on
to
the
steps
of
the
terrace
and
taking
the
book
with
her
stepped
out
of
the
room
on
the
terrace
a
peacock
was
airing
itself
with
some
and
when
it
saw
the
princess
it
raised
its
great
tail
to
display
itself
to
greater
advantage
then
it
quivered
all
over
until
the
feathers
of
its
tail
rattled
one
against
the
other
and
the
hens
looked
admiringly
at
him
and
then
sideways
at
one
another
nodding
their
heads
and
clucking
as
if
to
say
ha
what
a
fine
fellow
our
master
is
and
what
a
splendid
tail
he
s
got
much
better
than
that
poor
human
being
s
yellow
stuff
which
only
moves
when
the
wind
blows
and
then
they
looked
contemptuously
at
the
princess
s
golden
hair
and
clucked
to
each
other
again
and
followed
the
peacock
which
was
strutting
away
to
another
part
of
the
terrace
so
the
princess
went
and
looked
for
the
swans
but
they
were
busily
engaged
right
over
at
the
other
side
of
the
lake
turning
bottom
upwards
in
a
very
undignified
manner
and
they
refused
to
come
for
any
amount
of
calling
as
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
she
went
and
sat
down
in
a
shady
nook
in
the
white
marble
wall
and
began
to
look
at
her
book
i
shall
skip
the
introduction
and
the
prologue
s
always
dry
yes
let
s
see
this
will
the
knightes
it
hasn
t
got
any
apostrophe
to
that
s
bad
grammar
i
m
sure
however
i
ll
go
so
she
settled
herself
in
a
comfortable
position
with
the
book
on
her
lap
and
began
again
whilom
as
olde
stories
tellen
us
a
certeyn
duk
highte
here
she
stopped
this
man
may
be
a
good
poet
but
he
spells
awfully
badly
fancy
certain
spelt
with
an
and
duke
without
an
it
sounds
like
and
then
what
was
the
height
of
theseus
i
can
t
understand
it
at
however
she
read
on
skipping
pages
here
and
there
for
it
was
almost
impossible
for
her
to
understand
it
now
it
happened
that
as
she
turned
the
pages
over
she
was
thinking
of
something
eye
happened
to
fall
on
the
name
of
why
that
must
be
diana
only
they
ve
forgotten
the
i
ll
look
a
little
farther
and
see
what
it
says
about
so
she
ran
her
eye
down
the
page
and
sure
enough
she
came
upon
the
name
why
it
s
spelt
with
a
y
now
she
said
chaucer
evidently
doesn
t
know
his
own
mind
in
the
matter
of
spelling
i
ll
write
to
him
and
ask
him
about
it
now
let
s
see
what
it
says
why
it
appears
to
be
a
prayer
or
an
invocation
or
so
she
read
o
chaste
goddes
of
the
woodes
greene
to
whence
bothe
heven
and
erthe
are
seene
queen
of
the
regne
of
pluto
dark
and
lowe
goddes
of
maydens
that
myn
hert
has
knowe
ful
many
a
yeer
ye
woot
what
i
desire
as
keep
me
fro
the
vengeans
of
thilk
yre
that
actæon
aboughte
trewely
just
at
this
point
she
heard
the
rattling
of
chariot
wheels
and
diana
appeared
to
her
well
what
do
you
want
now
she
said
i
don
t
want
anything
in
particular
said
ernalie
in
astonishment
then
why
did
you
go
on
praying
to
me
like
that
i
wasn
t
praying
i
was
it
doesn
t
matter
to
me
it
was
a
very
funny
prayer
whoever
was
it
by
he
must
have
been
a
stupid
he
was
the
father
of
english
poetry
the
princess
said
reproachfully
i
should
have
thought
he
was
a
when
he
wrote
why
said
the
princess
in
astonishment
it
seems
uncommonly
like
the
writing
of
a
man
in
his
second
childhood
however
that
does
not
matter
about
the
feather
now
what
can
i
do
in
exchange
for
it
i
will
give
you
anything
you
the
princess
looked
at
the
goddess
why
do
you
want
the
feather
so
much
she
asked
are
you
not
invisible
enough
already
the
goddess
looked
at
her
sneeringly
i
invisible
to
dull
mortals
but
we
gods
can
see
each
other
well
enough
invisible
or
not
if
i
had
this
feather
though
it
would
be
different
and
i
should
be
able
to
laugh
at
venus
and
that
then
i
m
sure
i
won
t
give
it
you
for
as
venus
is
the
goddess
of
beauty
she
might
make
me
ugly
and
that
would
not
be
nice
for
diana
laughed
you
evidently
don
t
consider
yourself
she
said
and
she
was
just
going
on
to
say
something
else
when
an
enormous
wolf
without
a
muzzle
too
appeared
coming
round
the
side
of
the
palace
there
s
mars
said
diana
i
don
t
see
him
i
only
see
a
horrible
wolf
but
the
goddess
interrupted
her
why
you
stupid
that
s
mars
s
wolf
and
where
it
is
mars
is
sure
to
be
or
he
isn
t
far
but
what
does
he
want
here
asked
ernalie
he
s
going
to
escort
me
to
jupiter
s
ball
and
he
ll
be
awfully
impatient
however
he
can
wait
now
think
is
there
nothing
the
princess
reflected
a
moment
if
i
give
it
to
you
she
said
you
must
do
several
things
for
it
and
those
the
goddess
nodded
first
you
must
make
a
road
across
the
mountains
into
the
country
that
is
easy
enough
said
the
goddess
then
you
must
kill
the
he
died
last
week
of
sheer
starvation
so
that
s
done
you
must
bring
treblo
do
you
mean
that
he
s
to
marry
you
that
s
too
bad
considering
that
you
know
i
detest
marriages
however
it
can
t
be
helped
is
that
all
because
if
there
s
much
more
you
had
better
write
it
there
s
nothing
more
except
that
it
must
all
be
done
by
six
oh
is
that
all
you
shall
have
it
all
done
before
then
said
the
goddess
very
much
relieved
that
the
tasks
that
were
to
be
done
had
been
set
then
if
you
re
here
evening
i
ll
give
it
to
just
then
mars
appeared
round
the
corner
looking
very
if
you
coming
at
all
you
d
better
come
at
so
diana
said
very
well
evening
i
shall
be
and
she
drove
her
chariot
towards
the
god
of
war
and
when
he
had
got
in
they
turned
the
corner
of
the
house
and
disappeared
just
then
the
king
came
into
the
garden
from
the
library
window
what
have
you
been
doing
he
asked
her
i
ve
been
watching
you
for
some
minutes
from
the
window
and
you
ve
been
going
on
in
the
most
extraordinary
manner
talking
and
laughing
just
as
if
you
had
been
speaking
to
some
the
princess
brushed
back
her
hair
from
her
face
oh
i
didn
t
know
you
could
see
me
she
said
it
s
a
little
surprise
i
ve
been
preparing
for
indeed
you
surprise
me
the
king
said
ah
well
if
i
do
that
so
easily
perhaps
i
shall
do
it
often
she
said
what
have
you
been
doing
all
the
morning
the
king
asked
all
the
morning
said
the
princess
in
astonishment
it
s
not
late
is
it
the
king
pulled
out
his
watch
and
looked
at
it
it
s
five
by
my
watch
but
i
don
t
think
that
s
quite
fact
it
stopped
three
days
ago
ah
i
thought
s
the
you
needn
t
wash
your
hands
or
you
ll
be
so
they
went
in
together
and
the
rest
of
the
day
passed
off
quietly
except
that
every
now
and
then
one
of
the
enthusiastic
nobles
insisted
on
coming
in
and
welcoming
the
princess
although
the
king
had
given
strict
orders
that
no
one
should
be
admitted
as
he
wanted
to
be
alone
for
the
day
in
spite
of
this
every
now
and
then
an
elderly
duchess
rush
into
the
royal
presence
and
offer
her
congratulations
at
last
just
as
they
hoped
that
the
last
of
them
had
come
and
gone
the
door
opened
and
an
elderly
would
have
been
offended
at
being
called
in
and
clasped
the
princess
in
his
arms
my
adored
he
was
just
beginning
but
the
princess
boxed
his
ears
suddenly
and
he
let
go
what
on
earth
does
this
mean
she
said
turning
to
the
king
first
i
am
inundated
with
duchesses
until
i
m
quite
tired
of
the
name
and
then
this
old
fright
rushes
in
and
calls
me
duchess
when
i
m
not
a
duchess
at
all
what
does
he
mean
papa
the
king
looked
rather
embarrassed
it
s
one
of
them
he
said
meaningly
oh
it
s
one
of
them
is
it
she
said
well
sir
to
the
what
do
mean
by
forcing
your
way
here
against
the
royal
orders
i
thought
said
the
duke
looking
rather
foolish
that
as
you
are
going
but
i
m
not
said
ernalie
suddenly
after
such
rudeness
you
may
go
and
don
t
come
back
and
the
duke
went
that
s
got
rid
of
one
of
them
at
any
rate
the
king
said
with
a
sigh
of
relief
i
ll
do
my
best
to
get
rid
of
them
all
said
the
princess
how
the
king
began
then
he
stopped
wait
a
moment
i
have
an
idea
he
went
on
indeed
you
surprise
me
said
the
princess
but
the
king
did
not
notice
her
impertinent
remark
he
went
to
a
drawer
and
took
out
a
large
piece
of
paper
and
wrote
on
it
as
large
as
he
could
notice
during
the
next
hours
any
one
found
kissing
embracing
congratulating
or
suing
for
the
hand
of
the
be
submerged
three
times
in
the
palace
signed
caret
etc
that
ought
to
do
it
said
the
king
surveying
his
handiwork
approvingly
just
then
the
door
opened
and
two
more
old
wearing
a
ducal
in
as
fast
as
they
could
my
dear
princess
my
darling
wife
they
duetted
in
feeble
tones
showing
as
much
joy
as
their
faces
were
capable
of
which
made
them
look
about
as
pleasant
as
a
pair
of
japanese
masks
allow
me
to
congratulate
you
allow
me
to
offer
my
congratulations
they
went
on
now
you
ve
done
it
said
the
king
look
here
and
he
showed
them
the
notice
the
two
dukes
turned
each
a
different
shade
of
yellow
but
your
majesty
one
of
them
began
but
your
majesty
said
the
other
suddenly
as
i
as
i
the
other
put
in
each
of
them
stopped
and
looked
angrily
at
the
other
as
the
elect
of
the
king
the
first
one
began
as
the
affianced
husband
of
the
princess
said
the
other
i
think
i
have
the
right
to
speak
first
they
both
said
angrily
but
the
king
said
coolly
my
lords
the
case
is
very
clear
you
have
each
of
you
offended
against
the
law
by
congratulating
the
princess
and
as
one
of
you
if
not
both
intends
to
marry
my
daughter
and
become
king
it
is
as
well
to
teach
you
from
the
beginning
that
the
law
must
be
abided
by
therefore
you
will
be
submerged
the
notice
one
of
you
expires
the
other
will
then
marry
ernalie
and
in
course
of
he
does
not
die
of
the
effects
in
the
will
ascend
the
throne
having
learnt
a
useful
as
the
dukes
got
greener
and
greener
at
this
the
king
went
on
the
sentence
had
better
be
executed
at
once
so
come
along
to
the
but
your
majesty
said
one
of
them
i
am
subject
to
rheumatism
and
i
should
not
be
fit
to
reign
if
this
immersion
in
cold
water
should
make
it
so
bad
that
i
was
unable
to
that
s
just
the
case
with
me
said
the
other
ah
well
if
that
is
so
said
the
king
perhaps
you
would
like
to
give
up
your
pretensions
to
my
daughter
s
hand
in
that
case
i
should
let
you
off
because
there
would
be
no
need
to
give
you
such
a
practical
exemplification
of
the
majesty
of
the
the
dukes
looked
perplexedly
at
one
another
i
think
said
one
of
them
that
under
the
circumstances
i
will
give
up
my
pretensions
to
the
princess
s
here
he
looked
regretfully
at
her
right
hand
and
i
too
said
the
other
sadly
looking
at
her
left
hand
how
gallant
of
you
the
princess
said
ironically
and
now
as
you
ve
got
rid
of
me
so
easily
perhaps
you
will
be
so
kind
as
to
leave
us
for
a
time
duetted
the
dukes
and
they
huddled
out
as
well
as
they
could
each
trying
to
get
behind
the
other
i
think
that
s
got
rid
of
all
the
suitors
for
the
king
said
when
the
door
closed
behind
them
i
ll
just
go
and
have
the
notice
hung
on
the
door
and
i
ll
be
back
in
a
and
he
went
too
now
really
he
thought
he
had
let
the
dukes
off
too
easily
and
he
intended
to
catch
them
up
and
fine
them
but
they
had
made
off
so
uncommonly
fast
that
they
had
disappeared
before
he
got
to
the
street
door
meanwhile
the
princess
waited
quietly
for
him
but
hearing
a
noise
of
wheels
outside
the
window
she
went
to
see
what
was
the
cause
of
it
why
it
s
him
she
said
delightedly
and
with
utter
disregard
of
english
grammar
opening
the
window
she
called
out
treblo
treblo
and
running
down
the
steps
towards
him
threw
herself
into
his
arms
for
a
moment
she
was
too
much
out
of
breath
to
say
anything
at
all
and
treblo
too
surprised
to
do
anything
but
just
hold
her
in
his
arms
and
the
king
who
had
just
returned
from
the
search
after
the
dukes
was
far
too
taken
aback
to
do
anything
but
stand
with
his
mouth
and
eyes
wide
open
i
call
this
too
bad
he
said
in
a
low
voice
and
then
raising
it
he
called
out
young
man
i
say
have
you
seen
the
notice
treblo
looked
annoyed
what
is
the
notice
to
me
you
old
fool
he
said
the
king
looked
more
and
more
astonished
this
is
too
much
he
said
ernalie
when
you
ve
done
kissing
that
young
man
perhaps
you
ll
tell
me
who
he
is
you
see
it
s
no
use
my
putting
up
notices
about
other
people
embracing
you
if
you
go
and
perform
on
some
one
immediately
afterwards
now
just
tell
me
who
it
why
it
s
him
papa
said
ernalie
who
had
by
this
time
disengaged
herself
oh
it
s
a
is
it
the
king
said
that
s
what
the
three
others
said
they
were
but
they
wouldn
t
suit
but
they
were
so
very
old
besides
this
is
him
ah
i
see
said
the
papa
laughing
it
s
a
case
of
ancient
and
modern
hymns
and
you
prefer
the
modern
but
what
about
the
notice
what
the
notice
asked
treblo
rather
puzzled
and
what
has
it
got
to
do
with
me
more
than
you
think
said
the
king
it
s
worth
reading
i
can
tell
you
especially
during
the
next
hours
i
should
advise
you
to
learn
it
by
is
if
you
intend
however
i
ll
go
and
fetch
it
and
you
will
be
able
to
see
for
and
the
king
went
off
to
look
for
his
notice
when
he
had
gone
the
princess
said
but
how
did
you
get
here
i
thought
the
mountains
could
not
be
i
don
t
know
anything
about
the
mountains
or
how
i
came
here
either
for
that
matter
all
i
know
is
that
i
was
suddenly
caught
up
in
a
thick
mist
which
hid
me
from
every
one
and
every
one
from
me
too
and
before
i
knew
anything
i
was
whirled
off
here
in
about
a
minute
and
a
half
and
then
you
came
running
down
the
that
s
all
i
know
now
perhaps
you
ll
tell
me
where
i
am
for
i
haven
t
the
faintest
idea
why
you
re
in
the
middle
of
the
kingdom
of
aoland
and
that
was
my
father
and
this
is
my
it
s
all
yes
it
s
all
right
now
but
you
wouldn
t
have
said
it
was
all
right
if
you
had
been
carried
like
but
you
should
feel
yourself
highly
honoured
and
not
injured
why
you
stupid
fellow
it
was
a
goddess
who
was
carrying
you
like
the
heroes
of
a
goddess
said
the
prince
laughing
why
you
must
have
been
the
goddess
ernalie
and
you
re
but
the
princess
stopped
him
what
s
the
use
of
saying
that
if
you
won
t
believe
me
it
really
was
a
goddess
and
if
you
would
like
to
know
her
name
it
was
diana
said
the
prince
why
did
she
carry
me
off
like
this
because
i
told
her
to
of
the
prince
shook
his
head
come
i
say
ernalie
he
said
this
is
too
much
you
know
i
suppose
you
want
me
to
believe
that
of
course
i
do
why
should
i
have
told
you
if
i
hadn
t
wanted
you
to
yes
that
s
all
very
well
said
the
unbelieving
prince
but
how
do
you
do
it
i
just
make
myself
invisible
and
then
i
make
people
do
everything
i
like
they
have
to
do
it
or
else
i
tease
them
till
they
do
but
let
s
come
into
the
house
and
i
ll
tell
you
all
about
it
but
why
are
you
holding
me
so
tightly
i
am
afraid
that
you
will
suddenly
vanish
as
you
did
once
before
and
i
don
t
want
ve
been
away
from
me
long
oh
but
i
won
t
leave
you
again
treblo
she
said
i
promise
is
if
you
don
t
want
me
then
you
won
t
leave
me
dear
he
said
for
i
shall
never
want
to
lose
sight
of
you
so
they
went
in
and
the
princess
told
him
what
you
know
you
haven
t
skipped
it
but
all
the
same
he
did
not
leave
go
of
her
and
i
don
t
think
it
was
from
mistrust
ernalie
finished
relating
her
story
and
the
prince
was
beginning
my
dearest
ernalie
how
can
when
the
door
opened
and
the
king
came
in
i
ve
had
such
a
job
he
said
wiping
his
forehead
there
were
about
three
thousand
people
assembled
reading
the
notice
and
they
jeered
and
hooted
so
much
that
i
had
to
make
them
a
speech
before
they
d
go
away
however
here
s
the
the
prince
read
it
through
carefully
and
when
he
had
finished
he
looked
at
the
king
and
said
well
that
s
just
it
said
the
king
the
palace
but
as
i
m
the
affianced
bride
mean
as
ernalie
s
my
future
that
s
just
what
the
other
two
least
they
said
and
more
correctly
that
they
were
my
elect
only
that
didn
t
help
by
this
time
the
prince
was
looking
more
puzzled
than
ever
who
are
these
other
two
he
said
turning
to
the
princess
beware
of
the
monster
the
king
said
parenthetically
oh
they
re
only
three
dukes
that
papa
had
promised
my
hand
i
wouldn
t
have
you
mean
they
wouldn
t
have
you
said
the
king
correcting
her
i
don
t
mean
anything
of
the
sort
said
the
princess
oh
very
well
my
dear
said
the
king
of
course
if
you
say
so
it
s
all
right
but
how
about
the
notice
i
think
we
ll
tear
that
up
said
ernalie
it
s
done
its
duty
and
it
will
be
rather
in
the
way
indeed
you
surprise
me
remarked
the
king
ernalie
is
quite
right
said
the
prince
oh
is
she
said
the
king
then
i
suppose
i
d
better
tear
it
and
he
did
when
he
had
finished
and
had
thrown
the
fragments
into
the
basket
he
said
now
i
suppose
you
want
me
to
consent
to
your
marrying
each
other
and
i
suppose
i
d
better
or
else
i
shall
have
ernalie
pitching
into
me
like
i
really
don
t
know
who
you
are
young
man
except
that
ernalie
says
you
are
him
she
ought
to
say
he
and
so
i
suppose
you
are
treblo
the
prince
of
the
neighbouring
kingdom
i
am
said
the
prince
and
i
suppose
you
are
the
king
of
this
country
the
king
was
just
about
to
say
i
am
when
another
voice
sounded
through
the
room
so
clear
and
commanding
that
each
of
them
looked
towards
the
window
from
which
it
came
but
nothing
was
to
be
seen
there
the
road
is
made
it
said
and
now
perhaps
you
ll
give
me
the
certainly
said
the
princess
here
it
is
and
she
held
it
out
in
the
direction
of
the
goddess
only
you
might
let
us
see
you
before
you
go
for
oh
certainly
said
the
goddess
for
to
tell
the
truth
others
besides
very
fond
of
being
admired
and
immediately
she
appeared
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
her
silver
bow
and
quiver
slung
over
her
back
and
the
star
that
she
always
wore
shining
on
her
forehead
she
took
the
feather
and
smiling
put
it
to
her
hair
and
on
the
moment
passed
away
so
that
where
she
had
seemed
to
be
they
saw
the
thin
circlet
of
the
moon
hanging
silvery
and
pale
over
the
flush
of
the
sun
s
departure
it
really
was
diana
treblo
said
yes
of
course
it
was
you
sceptical
boy
ernalie
answered
and
then
with
a
little
sigh
i
wish
i
had
the
feather
still
it
makes
me
feel
just
like
any
other
girl
being
without
but
you
re
a
s
no
one
like
you
in
the
world
treblo
said
hotly
why
i
believe
you
re
my
word
i
do
the
king
said
suddenly
looking
up
from
a
book
in
which
he
had
seemed
immersed
never
knew
any
one
like
let
s
go
into
the
garden
treblo
the
princess
said
you
ll
catch
your
deaths
of
cold
the
king
remarked
but
somehow
although
they
quietly
ignored
his
prudent
observation
which
was
really
wrong
of
them
they
never
caught
cold
and
that
is
all
the
stranger
because
the
evening
was
falling
very
rapidly
with
a
feeling
of
cool
dew
after
the
heat
of
the
day
with
a
faint
scent
of
roses
and
honeysuckle
and
no
sound
on
the
air
but
the
splash
of
a
fish
as
it
jumped
for
a
moment
out
of
the
smooth
river
or
the
short
shrill
shriek
of
a
bat
that
was
circling
in
the
air
above
them
they
sat
in
a
marble
niche
in
the
wall
that
had
roses
running
up
it
and
hanging
down
like
a
net
in
front
of
and
talked
till
it
grew
so
dark
that
he
could
no
longer
see
the
golden
threads
in
her
brown
hair
until
he
could
no
longer
see
that
her
eyes
were
and
or
even
that
her
face
was
a
long
sweet
serious
oval
so
you
see
it
must
have
been
a
long
time
that
they
sat
and
talked
thus
but
from
this
you
are
not
to
imagine
that
their
example
is
to
be
by
any
means
because
i
am
perfectly
certain
that
if
any
one
were
foolish
enough
to
do
it
nowadays
they
d
have
perfectly
miserable
at
the
very
least
not
to
mention
rheumatic
pains
so
i
should
really
advise
you
not
to
try
any
such
tricks
very
likely
the
prince
and
princess
had
something
especial
to
keep
them
warm
or
perhaps
they
sat
rather
close
s
just
possible
however
next
morning
the
prince
and
princess
set
out
together
for
the
court
of
king
abbonamento
they
arrived
safely
at
the
palace
and
were
received
with
joy
by
every
mumkie
who
was
already
making
preparations
to
make
himself
king
again
for
he
was
quite
sure
that
the
prince
had
been
carried
off
for
good
so
when
he
saw
the
prince
returning
safe
and
sound
he
was
seized
with
such
a
fit
of
rage
that
he
jumped
into
the
sea
and
swam
right
out
of
sight
wopole
having
moreover
committed
the
fatal
mistake
of
setting
sail
from
the
moon
when
it
set
had
unfortunately
chosen
the
wrong
side
of
the
earth
and
from
that
day
to
this
neither
he
nor
mumkie
has
ever
been
heard
more
of
but
in
a
very
short
time
the
prince
and
princess
were
married
and
it
is
needless
to
since
we
live
in
the
nineteenth
century
no
one
will
believe
it
but
still
if
you
ll
take
my
word
for
lived
happily
ever
afterwards
the
end
