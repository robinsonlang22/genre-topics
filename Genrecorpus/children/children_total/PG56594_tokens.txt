preface
there
is
in
england
a
large
and
interesting
county
mostly
green
on
maps
we
call
it
lincolnshire
there
is
a
part
of
that
same
county
where
you
see
the
gleaming
silver
of
the
wash
so
fatal
to
king
john
of
unpleasing
memory
and
the
green
marshlands
are
drained
by
wide
dykes
and
stakes
stand
bunched
at
intervals
along
the
shore
to
break
the
fury
of
the
sea
at
the
great
high
tides
of
spring
and
autumn
and
the
river
that
meanders
through
the
deeps
as
these
marsh
flats
are
called
has
no
banks
when
the
tide
is
full
but
seems
as
though
its
waters
brimmed
and
only
kept
themselves
from
slopping
over
by
an
amazing
steadiness
of
hand
in
which
you
are
not

to

little

head
of
the
lower
school
chapter
i
luckie
jean
shop
there
was
a
small
kid
called
jennie
a
millionaire
with
a
penny
but
this
her
disgrace
is
she
blued
it
on
laces
and
so
all
the
rest
had
any
but
joe
jennie
objected
bingo
as
gavin
chanted
the
last
line
of
this
lyric
in
a
cheerful
jigging
and
a
voice
that
would
have
done
credit
to
a
cathedral
choir
and
mums
wanted
me
to
get
joey
added
you
see
these
have
any
tags
and
the
ends
are
all
frayed
out
what
wrong
with
stiffening
up
the
ends
with
bingo
demanded
gavin
the
resourceful
i
never
thought
that
come
to
spending
the
one
penny
going
on
silly
when
we
have
to
go
to
luckie
jean
shop
and
might
have
bought
or
at
least
joey
cast
a
glance
down
at
the
very
dilapidated
laces
securing
her
shabby
shoes
her
indifference
to
her
own
personal
appearance
was
supreme
but
mums
had
seemed
worried
about
those
and
it
was
a
point
of
honour
in
the
graham
family
to
protect
mums
from
all
possible
worries
all
the
same
she
agreed
with
gavin
it
was
a
waste
to
be
going
all
the
way
to
crumach
and
luckie
jean
shop
without
so
much
as
a
penny
to
spend
among
the
five
of
them
gavin
ronnie
kirsty
bingo
and
herself
she
considered
the
question
but
joey
is
jennie
objected
bingo
once
more
with
determination
bingo
never
left
a
question
till
he
got
an
answer
even
when
gavin
smacked
his
head
for
bothering
which
happened
now
and
then
father
the
big
cheery
father
to
whom
the
five
had
said
their
last
one
chilly
morning
close
on
two
years
ago
at
crumach
station
had
called
bingo
the
little
because
you
make
him
let
go
gavin
knew
that
and
answered
the
objection
why
you
little
ass
joey
wo
rhyme
with
anything
that
all
and
jocelyn
even
worse
and
of
course
anyone
can
see
who
meant
because
joey
the
only
one
of
us
who
has
so
much
as
a
brass
farthing
to
bless
herself
with
and
she
going
to
spend
all
her
farthings
on
observed
bingo
sorrowfully
and
the
corners
of
his
mouth
went
down
bingo
was
only
six
that
was
his
excuse
and
he
was
the
only
member
of
the
graham
family
who
had
been
known
to
cry
for
years
they
had
got
a
tear
out
of
gavin
when
he
fell
off
a
hayrick
and
dislocated
his
shoulder
and
it
was
put
back
by
the
local
a
process
which
is
far
from
pleasant
when
unaccompanied
by
chloroform
joey
hastened
to
avert
the
tragedy
which
might
have
disgraced
the
name
of
graham
if
bingo
were
left
in
suspense
too
long
if
you
that
will
fix
up
my
so
that
mums
wo
worry
we
use
the
penny
on
anything
you
like
she
said
her
words
produced
quite
a
sensation
gavin
patted
her
violently
on
the
back
kirsty
jumped
three
times
into
the
air
like
a
young
chamois
with
a
great
display
of
long
thin
scratched
legs
no
one
in
those
parts
ever
saw
anything
like
the
way
those
graham
children
grew
and
bingo
hugged
her
ecstatically
before
burrowing
in
the
pocket
of
his
tiny
knickers
for
a
small
and
grubby
piece
of
yellow
they
all
sat
down
on
the
high
heathery
moor
to
mend
the
laces
there
and
then
lots
of
time
gavin
pronounced
consulting
the
gold
which
father
had
said
his
eldest
boy
was
to
have
if
he
never
came
back
the
postman
never
gets
to
crumach
till
four
and
not
three
but
there
may
be
soldiers
come
by
the
south
train
suggested
bingo
we
want
some
time
to
see
them
heaps
of
time
declared
gavin
pinching
bits
off
the
lump
of
only
three
miles
from
here
to
crumach
and
we
can
see
the
soldiers
after
we
done
mums
shopping
and
got
the
post
if
we
before
joey
looked
up
from
her
refractory
laces
shaking
her
thick
fair
hair
out
of
her
eyes
but
letter
might
have
come
by
the
post
gav
if
it
has
mums
will
want
to
know
at
once
wo
she
i
forgotten
that
letter
might
have
come
gavin
answered
more
soberly
there
leave
that
lace
to
dry
hard
old
girl
and
have
a
topping
tag
did
the
minister
expect
it
so
soon
he
said
he
just
thought
it
might
come
will
it
come
if
you
failed
to
get
the
scholarship
kirsty
asked
joey
considered
i
do
know
but
i
should
think
they
would
write
to
everybody
to
tell
them
that
they
failed
craigie
said
there
were
seven
hundred
and
candidates
just
think
of
all
the
stamps
the
family
did
think
with
a
gasp
when
they
thought
at
all
about
money
it
was
as
a
thing
which
must
be
kept
for
boots
and
bread
and
margarine
never
as
a
thing
that
you
could
squander
recklessly
on
luxuries
like
stamps
no
i
should
think
there
would
be
a
letter
if
you
failed
ronnie
agreed
sadly
he
had
a
right
to
be
serious
for
he
was
after
joey
the
person
most
immediately
concerned
with
the
letter
which
it
was
remotely
possible
that
the
postman
might
bring
to
crumach
the
five
had
always
known
that
father
thought
boys
and
girls
should
share
alike
where
education
was
concerned
joey
was
to
have
her
chance
at
a
big
public
school
as
well
as
gavin
and
ronnie
and
kirsty
was
to
follow
when
she
was
old
enough
as
surely
as
little
bingo
but
before
gavin
had
been
two
years
at
the
preparatory
from
which
he
was
out
to
win
an
eton
or
winchester
scholarship
the
news
came
to
the
pretty
house
in
hertfordshire
a
house
which
always
seemed
to
strangers
so
bewilderingly
full
of
children
dogs
and
cats
that
major
graham
had
fallen
wounded
into
the
hands
of
the
huns
during
our
last
retreat
in
the
anxious
spring
of
and
had
succumbed
to
the
brutalities
of
a
prison
camp
in
the
land
of
kultur
his
private
means
had
been
sunk
in
an
austrian
and
were
gone
beyond
recall
he
had
insured
his
life
and
mums
was
left
to
bring
up
five
healthy
hungry
children
on
the
insurance
money
and
her
pension
somehow
father
owned
a
little
stone
cottage
in
a
tiny
highland
village
four
miles
north
of
crumach
living
was
comparatively
cheap
at
calgarloch
and
they
had
spent
the
last
glorious
leave
there
all
together
mums
and
the
family
moved
north
and
in
the
cottage
held
a
council
of
war
to
review
their
resources
joey
could
see
that
picture
now
mums
very
slight
and
in
her
weeds
and
the
family
sprawling
about
her
all
long
of
leg
and
outgrown
as
to
clothes
but
fiercely
in
readiness
to
fight
any
notion
on
part
that
she
might
have
managed
for
them
better
it
was
then
mums
had
explained
that
however
economically
the
family
lived
in
calgarloch
it
was
only
possible
that
one
child
could
be
kept
at
school
at
a
time
if
mums
stopped
herself
and
substituted
when
gavin
won
his
scholarship
joey
could
go
to
school
ronnie
would
have
to
wait
until
she
left
ronnie
was
nearly
three
years
younger
so
waiting
would
be
possible
until
gavin
fought
his
way
out
into
a
public
school
the
rest
of
the
family
must
be
content
with
the
village
school
i
get
that
scholarship
mums
gavin
had
promised
growing
hot
and
red
and
he
had
kept
his
word
the
name
of
gavin
graham
had
headed
the
list
of
winchester
scholars
at
the
end
of
last
term
and
joey
chance
had
come
by
that
time
the
four
younger
grahams
had
grown
used
to
going
daily
to
the
little
village
school
where
the
pupils
at
most
numbered
fifteen
and
the
master
taught
the
latin
with
a
strong
doric
accent
and
an
absolute
enthusiastic
love
of
all
learning
which
could
not
help
communicating
itself
to
the
boys
and
girls
in
his
care
he
taught
the
secular
subjects
untiringly
and
the
minister
craigie
poured
the
shorter
catechism
and
much
else
into
the
children
twice
a
week
so
sternly
that
it
was
at
first
quite
a
surprise
to
the
grahams
to
find
him
the
best
of
comrades
and
friends
out
of
school
it
was
during
a
thrilling
expedition
to
the
loch
for
fishing
shorter
catechism
not
so
much
as
mentioned
that
joey
confided
in
him
to
the
extent
of
asking
if
thirteen
and
tall
for
one
age
might
stand
a
chance
as
a
pupil
teacher
at
a
proper
girls
school
for
if
i
cost
anything
ronnie
could
go
and
he
over
ten
now
and
would
be
fearfully
old
by
the
time
i
seventeen
she
explained
i
suppose
i
could
teach
the
small
kids
like
kirsty
and
i
could
always
punch
their
heads
if
they
ragged
in
class
joey
never
could
think
why
craigie
should
laugh
so
helplessly
at
this
suggestion
but
he
was
very
kind
all
the
same
and
said
that
he
would
see
what
he
could
do
what
he
did
was
to
talk
things
over
with
the
schoolmaster
and
then
to
write
a
letter
to
miss
jean
craigie
redlands
college
lincolnshire
a
few
days
later
he
called
on
graham
accompanied
by
the
schoolmaster
and
with
the
answer
to
that
letter
in
his
pocket
redlands
offered
a
scholarship
once
in
every
four
years
to
be
competed
for
by
girls
under
fourteen
the
scholarship
provided
four
years
free
at
the
great
girls
school
and
forty
pounds
annually
for
books
and
clothes
he
wanted
to
enter
joey
for
the
scholarship
though
the
entrance
examination
loomed
only
six
weeks
ahead
she
seldom
remembers
the
shorter
catechism
but
the
child
has
a
brain
he
said
and
what
is
more
important
she
has
grit
i
say
that
she
can
win
the
redlands
scholarship
of
which
my
sister
the
mathematical
mistress
there
writes
full
particulars
but
i
do
say
that
she
might
although
the
competition
will
be
enormous
let
her
try
and
mums
had
thankfully
said
yes
joey
worked
early
and
late
during
those
six
weeks
in
spite
of
for
the
rest
of
her
world
she
lived
between
the
manse
and
the
schoolmaster
and
the
two
clever
men
coached
her
untiringly
and
then
the
sealed
papers
came
down
by
special
permission
to
craigie
and
for
three
days
joey
hot
inky
and
anxious
was
shut
up
in
the
minister
study
answering
the
terrible
questions
the
examiners
had
set
and
then
craigie
packed
her
sheets
of
foolscap
off
to
redlands
and
there
was
nothing
left
to
do
but
to
wait
she
had
been
waiting
now
for
ten
long
days
the
postman
did
not
come
to
calgarloch
people
fetched
their
letters
when
they
expected
any
from
the
little
post
office
at
crumach
but
the
grahams
thought
that
no
hardship
a
walk
over
the
corner
of
the
moor
and
across
the
lower
shoulder
of
the
hills
that
lay
between
calgarloch
and
crumach
was
always
fun
especially
if
there
were
anything
to
spend
in
the
town
but
the
comparative
merits
of
and
seemed
unimportant
they
were
all
thinking
of
the
letter
ronnie
dropped
behind
with
joey
when
the
were
finished
with
and
the
party
ready
to
go
on
if
you
get
it
i
could
go
to
christopher
this
term
he
said
you
know
christopher
told
mums
there
was
the
one
vacancy
and
he
keep
it
on
the
chance
because
of
gav
having
done
so
well
yes
and
if
you
got
a
winchester
scholarship
like
gav
has
in
three
and
a
half
years
kirsty
would
only
be
twelve
just
heaps
of
time
for
coming
on
to
redlands
joey
remarked
hopefully
and
then
as
a
wave
of
doubt
swept
over
her
but
i
never
get
it
out
of
seven
hundred
and
girls
i
went
some
awful
howlers
i
know
the
others
did
too
suggested
ronnie
i
afraid
mums
will
mind
if
i
fail
joey
said
of
course
pretend
she
does
and
say
all
she
cares
about
is
my
trying
but
she
wo
take
us
in
with
her
dearness
not
but
you
have
to
let
her
think
she
does
ronnie
announced
from
the
depths
of
past
experience
and
then
he
and
joey
were
silent
while
they
plodded
round
the
shoulder
of
the
hill
and
dropped
down
into
crumach
ahead
gavin
could
be
heard
gaily
discoursing
to
kirsty
and
bingo
on
the
homeric
exploits
of
winchester
men
but
then
it
was
different
for
gavin
he
had
won
his
scholarship
either
the
had
taken
longer
than
the
children
had
expected
or
the
gold
had
not
been
entirely
reliable
for
it
was
fully
four
when
they
turned
at
last
into
the
main
street
of
crumach
gavin
stopped
and
waited
for
the
other
two
the
post
be
in
we
better
go
to
luckie
jean
first
and
get
mums
things
after
as
a
matter
of
fact
one
got
a
good
many
of
the
things
at
luckie
jean
though
mums
had
a
certain
odd
favouritism
for
the
newly
established
grocer
at
pettalva
who
sent
a
cart
in
twice
a
week
to
crumach
and
had
biscuits
that
were
really
fresh
but
the
family
plumped
to
a
man
for
luckie
jean
true
the
fingers
with
which
she
ladled
out
your
provisions
were
and
not
acquainted
with
soap
and
water
but
the
recesses
of
her
shop
were
so
dark
and
mysterious
her
goods
so
various
and
unexpected
and
best
of
all
her
stories
were
so
thrilling
that
no
ordinary
shopman
who
drove
a
cart
could
dream
of
comparing
with
her
the
family
trooped
joyfully
in
a
body
to
luckie
jean
forthwith
she
had
the
post
office
not
so
much
on
account
of
her
competence
as
because
hers
was
at
the
time
the
postal
authorities
had
decided
to
open
a
branch
at
crumach
the
one
and
only
shop
there
later
when
a
polite
gentleman
from
pettalva
rendered
desperate
by
complaints
from
the
english
people
who
came
up
for
the
shooting
suggested
politely
to
luckie
jean
the
advisability
of
putting
the
charge
into
the
hands
of
a
younger
woman
he
thought
himself
fortunate
to
escape
with
his
eyes
still
intact
in
his
head
luckie
jean
half
blind
and
wholly
ignorant
as
to
all
but
local
names
and
places
kept
the
post
office
and
english
visitors
went
on
adding
to
the
national
revenue
by
writing
unavailing
letters
of
bitter
complaint
it
was
this
redoubtable
old
woman
who
looked
up
fiercely
over
her
spectacles
as
the
young
grahams
trooped
in
a
body
into
the
shop
she
was
bending
over
the
as
it
lay
on
the
counter
sorting
the
letters
and
papers
into
little
heaps
and
keeping
up
a
vigorous
undercurrent
of
grumbling
all
the
time
na
na
you
ca
come
worrying
for
sweeties
now
be
off
douce
bairnies
i
busy
no
hurry
said
gavin
politely
we
wait
and
he
began
to
wander
round
the
shop
hands
in
pockets
attended
by
his
constant
adorers
kirsty
and
bingo
joey
stood
staring
at
the
and
the
piles
of
letters
and
ronnie
stood
near
her
breathing
hard
it
was
no
use
to
interrupt
luckie
jean
when
she
was
busy
with
the
it
would
probably
mean
ignominious
expulsion
with
boxed
ears
for
luckie
jean
in
a
temper
was
no
respecter
of
persons
hillo
the
cake

of

with
interest
luckie

not
fall
upon
him
for
interrupting

the
englishy

answered
with
a
chuckle

the
widow

having
tried
to
pit

with

of

luckie

grumbled

up
at

consideringly
you

maybe
i
trust
you
wi
it
but
a
postwoman
must
be
gey
particular
ye
ken
i
know
joey
agreed
in
all
good
faith
though
it
was
hard
to
attend
to
ordinary
remarks
like
that
when
one
was
just
trembling
with
eagerness
to
know
what
letters
were
for
the
house
of
graham
you
mebbe
like
to
take
a
bit
of
a
look
at
they
scrawly
anes
as
i
pit
in
the
pile
ower
yonder
inquired
luckie
jean
unbending
still
more
there
what
they
ca
but
there
not
mony
writes
plain
for

their
fine
schuling

needing
more
you
had
the
monday
the
customer
a
small
boy
clasping
a
coin
tightly
in
his
hand
looked
apprehensively
at
the
postmistress
but
ma
mither
be
off
and
tell
your
mither
you
ate
your
far
too
quick
thundered
the
autocrat
but
gavin
came
to
the
rescue
stifling
a
laugh
i
say
mother

weigh
it
out
for
the
youngster
you
showed
me
how
ages
ago
ou
ay
ye
still

meddling
growled
luckie
jean
over
her
but
she
did
not
say
no
and
gavin
served
her
customer
and
put
the
money
into
the
till
in
a
very
professional
manner
joey
in
the
meanwhile
got
to
the
pile
of
redirected
letters
and
soon
succeeded
in
sorting
them
the
writing
in
most
cases
hardly
justifying
the
severe
criticism
of
the
crumach
postmistress
then
at
last
she
ventured
the
question
she
had
been
burning
to
put
all
the
time
have
you
come
on
any
for
us
yet
luckie
jean
busied
in
making
a
final
scoop
all
round
the
bag
with
her
long
thin
arm
jerked
her
head
in
the
direction
of
a
little
pile
at
the
end
of
the
counter
there
you
be
twa
or
three
letters
and
a
newspaper
for
your
maw
that
aal
five
grahams
hurled
themselves
simultaneously
on
the
little
pile
while
luckie
jean
tied
the
rest
up
in
lots
according
to
their
destination
gavin
was
there
first
he
looked
and
flung
them
down
one
after
another
in
deep
disappointment
the
blue
one
that
be
from
cousin
greta
see
the
crest
the
white
one
with
the
small
screwgy
writing
that
from
uncle
stafford
a
bill
and
this
is
a
newspaper
nothing
from
redlands
joey
joey
bit
back
a
little
gulp
of
disappointment
i
did
really
think
there
would
be
she
said
can
we
leave
any
more
letters
for
you
on
our
way
luckie
jean
ye
mind
not
to
get
playing
and
forgetting
of
them
asked
the
careful
postmistress
and
as
she
spoke
she
put
a
packet
into
joey
hand
the
string
was
insecurely
fastened
and
the
eight
or
nine
letters
came
to
the
floor
in
a
heap
all
except
one
the
bottom
one
which
stayed
in
joey
hand
luckie
jean
heading
had
been
at
fault
again
for
this
letter
mixed
up
with
sir
henry
martyn
and
miss
martyn
and
captain
kingston
was
directed
quite
distinctly
to
miss
jocelyn
graham
pilot
cottage
calgarloch
near
crumach
something
seemed
to
catch
at
joey
throat
so
that
for
a
moment
speaking
was
quite
difficult
she
always
remembered
afterwards
the
way
things
looked
as
she
saw
them
then
the
dusty
shop
with
its
dim
recesses
where
brooms
and
brushes
and
lurked
the
choked
windows
with
articles
of
food
displayed
the
open
box
of
coarse
cottons
and
crochet
wools
the
flitches
of
bacon
the
gay
tins
of
salmon
gavin
behind
the
counter
luckie
jean
closing
the
then
joey
swallowed
hard
and
opened
the
letter
this
is
what
she
read
the
trustees
of
the
redlands
scholarship
fund
have
much
pleasure
in
informing
miss
jocelyn
graham
that
she
obtained
the
largest
number
of
marks
in
the
recent
examination
and
the
redlands
scholarship
has
accordingly
been
awarded
to
her
she
is
therefore
entitled
to
four
years
free
residence
and
tuition
at
redlands
college
and
an
annual
grant
of
forty
pounds
for
necessary
expenses
i
i
got
it
joey
said
chapter
ii
out
into
the
world
everything
about
joey
was
new
from
top
to
toe
from
hat
to
boots
particularly
boots
that
knowledge
was
about
the
newest
thing
of
all
she
sat
in
her
corner
of
the
compartment
looking
alternately
from
the
window
at
the
flying
scenery
of
scotland
and
then
down
at
those
boots
strong
unpatched
with
superior
unknotted
laces
all
quite
new
she
was
wearing
the
long
dark
green
uniform
coat
of
redlands
and
the
soft
green
hat
with
a
band
of
the
same
colour
round
the
crown
and
the
school
arms
stamped
in
silver
underneath
she
wore
the
dark
green
serge
djibbah
with
white
flannel
blouse
and
green
tie
these
things
had
come
for
her
from
redlands
a
week
ago
with
the
bill
which
mums
had
paid
out
of
that
amazing
cheque
for
forty
pounds
a
cheque
which
joey
had
been
proud
to
endorse
under
the
envious
eyes
of
her
brothers
and
sister
the
cheque
carried
with
it
an
amazing
sense
of
wealth
so
it
had
been
a
blow
when
mums
firmly
refused
to
allow
one
penny
of
it
to
be
spent
on
anything
but
boots
and
clothes
for
joey
herself
however
craigie
after
some
careful
calculations
of
which
the
family
knew
nothing
produced
ten
shillings
as
a
parting
tip
on
the
day
the
family
were
going
to
pettalva
to
choose
joey
boots
that
was
a
great
day
for
joey
graham
aged
thirteen
years
and
three
months
for
craigie
gift
was
hampered
by
no
restrictions
she
proudly
stood
lunch
to
all
the
rest
tipped
the
waiter
a
seedy
gentleman
with
a
good
deal
of
limp
and
dingy
who
was
nevertheless
an
adept
at
putting
cruets
worcester
sauce
bottles
over
the
stains
on
the
tablecloth
of
the
little
restaurant
where
they
partook
largely
of
sausages
and
mashed
potatoes
limp
pastry
and
with
joey
hospitably
urging
them
on
to
further
efforts
even
gavin
the
winchester
man
was
no
greater
in
the
eyes
of
his
family
that
day
there
had
been
very
little
time
for
inconvenient
thoughts
of
possible
to
obtrude
themselves
during
those
bustling
days
of
preparation
of
course
it
would
be
strange
to
have
two
days
journey
between
herself
and
mums
and
the
rest
joey
knew
but
people
who
have
won
a
scholarship
do
go
in
for
being
besides
there
would
be
miss
craigie
craigie
sister
mathematical
mistress
at
redlands
and
a
friend
joey
was
comfortably
sure
so
she
made
her
own
final
preparations
very
cheerfully
and
helped
mums
rather
stickily
with
the
getting
ready
of
ronnie
shirts
and
stockings
for
his
plunge
a
week
later
into
gavin
old
preparatory
and
said
and
thank
you
to
the
schoolmaster
and
to
effie
and
ailie
the
sawmiller
twin
girls
who
sat
next
her
in
class
and
to
luckie
jean
who
unbent
to
an
extraordinary
degree
and
presented
a
whole
bag
of
sweeties
at
parting
and
was
finally
seen
off
at
crumach
by
the
entire
family
with
an
old
military
portmanteau
that
had
been
father
and
a
bewildering
quantity
of
new
clothes
in
it
mums
went
with
her
to
the
junction
at
pettalva
from
there
she
was
to
travel
in
the
care
of
the
guard
to
edinburgh
where
miss
craigie
would
meet
her
and
take
her
down
to
redlands
next
day
mums
and
joey
both
found
a
tendency
to
leave
little
gaps
in
the
conversation
as
the
roofs
of
pettalva
began
to
come
in
sight
i
shall
try
to
find
someone
who
is
going
the
whole
way
to
edinburgh
darling
mums
said
after
one
of
those
gaps
then
i
shall
feel
quite
happy
about
you
i
be
all
right
anyway
joey
said
determinedly
yes
my
joey
i
know
you
will
but
everything
including
the
travelling
will
be
a
little
new
i
know
mums
do
you
worry
sha
joey
persisted
though
the
roofs
of
pettalva
were
rather
blurred
just
then
i
know
it
will
be
new
but
i
going
to
like
redlands
awfully
and
write
you
reams
of
letters
so
you
wo
be
dull
and
and
joey
swallowed
a
lump
in
her
throat
there
wo
be
such
a
heap
of
stockings
for
you
to
mend
anyhow
they
two
were
alone
in
the
compartment
mums
caught
joey
in
her
arms
and
held
on
to
her
tight
oh
my
joey
i
mending
the
stockings
she
cried
with
a
little
sob
in
her
voice
and
then
she
tried
to
laugh
but
i
am
going
to
love
your
letters
darling
and
live
in
the
interesting
new
world
with
you
sha
we
watch
for
the
post
kirsty
and
bingo
and
i
and
always
be
making
excuses
to
go
to
the
shop
mums
put
away
her
handkerchief
and
went
on
more
in
her
ordinary
voice
none
of
us
have
ever
seen
the
fen
country
you
have
to
tell
us
all
about
it
and
cousin
greta
said
something
about
asking
you
out
on
a
sunday
now
and
then
and
she
has
all
kinds
of
beautiful
things
at
her
house
that
you
will
enjoy
seeing
joey
looked
doubtful
cousin
greta
infrequent
calls
at
the
old
home
had
generally
ended
in
disgrace
for
at
least
one
member
of
the
family
for
cousin
greta
made
no
secret
of
the
fact
that
she
considered
all
the
children
a
hopeless
set
of
little
raggamuffins
and
somebody
was
certain
to
live
down
to
her
ideas
lady
greta
sturt
was
father
cousin
and
always
spoke
of
the
children
as
his
only
though
she
put
their
faults
down
to
poor
mums
she
brought
them
the
best
chocolates
when
she
came
such
chocolates
as
were
a
rare
and
unaccustomed
luxury
even
before
the
war
but
the
grahams
were
not
to
be
bought
by
chocolates
though
it
must
be
owned
that
they
ate
them
with
great
speed
and
enjoyment
joey
was
sure
that
to
be
asked
out
by
cousin
greta
would
add
to
the
joy
of
redlands
you
will
be
nice
to
her
if
she
should
ask
you
mums
went
on
in
her
soft
pleading
voice
she
was
very
fond
of
father
and
did
a
great
many
kind
things
for
him
when
he
was
little
he
always
said
she
probably
gone
off
like
luckie
jean
englishy
cakes
do
joey
said
solemnly
but
added
for
mums
comfort
do
worry
mums
i
be
as
nice
as
i
know
how
and
most
likely
she
wo
want
me
again
after
she
seen
me
once
mums
smiled
and
then
the
train
stopped
at
pettalva
junction
and
the
bustle
of
changing
began
mums
found
a
lady
going
all
the
way
to
edinburgh
a
cheerful
personage
who
breezily
undertook
to
see
joey
safely
into
the
hands
of
miss
craigie
at
the
waverley
station
then
mums
bought
joey
buns
and
two
apples
and
a
magazine
and
reminded
her
of
the
packet
of
sandwiches
in
her
pocket
and
kissed
her
silently
and
joey
said
do
mind
mums
i
going
to
it
and
then
the
train
slid
out
of
the
station
and
joey
was
off
to
the
new
world
and
mums
was
left
behind
that
was
the
beginning
of
the
long
day
travelling
down
through
scotland
and
now
she
was
almost
at
edinburgh
and
the
end
in
a
few
minutes
miss
craigie
would
meet
her
miss
craigie
whom
joey
saw
as
a
replica
of
her
brother
only
in
a
coat
and
skirt
and
she
would
be
hearing
all
about
redlands
and
learning
what
a
new
girl
ought
to
know
joey
remembered
from
school
stories
that
new
girls
need
a
lot
of
watching
if
they
are
not
to
begin
their
school
career
with
unforgivable
blunders
she
was
very
thankful
that
she
was
going
to
travel
with
miss
craigie
she
was
also
rather
thankful
that
this
day
journey
was
nearly
over
she
seemed
to
have
sat
still
for
such
a
long
long
time
tresham
had
broken
it
a
little
for
herself
by
going
to
the
for
lunch
but
though
she
had
pressed
joey
most
kindly
to
come
with
her
as
her
guest
explaining
that
she
hated
meals
alone
joey
stuck
to
it
firmly
that
she
preferred
sandwiches
having
her
own
private
supply
of
family
pride
she
ate
her
sandwiches
potted
shrimp
and
margarine
and
the
buns
and
the
apples
in
solitude
they
did
take
long
nothing
like
as
long
as
tresham
lunch
did
the
afternoon
was
very
long
but
came
at
last
and
she
had
been
told
to
have
tea
in
the
she
and
tresham
had
it
together
at
a
little
table
fixed
firmly
to
the
floor
and
there
was
hot
buttered
toast
and
a
sort
of
mongrel
jam
and
you
had
to
pour
the
tea
carefully
because
of
the
lurches
of
the
train
joey
enjoyed
that
meal
and
it
was
five
by
the
time
it
was
finished
and
she
and
tresham
had
reeled
back
along
the
swaying
corridor
to
their
own
compartment
and
at
six
they
were
due
at
edinburgh
joey
tidied
herself
up
and
washed
her
hands
even
before
the
forth
bridge
was
reached
she
was
so
anxious
to
be
ready
in
good
time
and
that
wonderful
engineering
feat
was
crossed
with
a
certain
thrilling
and
delightful
sense
of
insecurity
about
the
crossing
and
corstorphine
hill
was
passed
and
the
train
was
slipping
into
the
waverley
station
edinburgh
at
last
joey
was
in
the
corridor
in
a
second
looking
for
miss
craigie
of
course
it
was
not
wonderful
that
she
did
not
see
her
at
once
the
station
was
so
big
and
the
people
so
many
but
even
when
she
had
got
out
accompanied
by
the
small
containing
her
and
by
her
new
umbrella
and
had
stood
quite
a
long
time
waiting
and
tiptoeing
by
the
door
of
the
compartment
while
tresham
claimed
the
luggage
for
them
both
still
there
was
no
sign
of
anyone
who
looked
like
craigie
sister
a
stout
elderly
woman
stood
at
a
little
distance
among
the
crowd
surveying
her
unblinkingly
but
joey
was
sure
that
be
miss
craigie
just
as
tresham
came
back
with
the
luggage
and
a
porter
this
personage
moved
forward
and
spoke
to
joey
with
distinct
caution
i
thinking
you
might
be
perhaps
miss
jocelyn
graham
yes
i
am
joey
confessed
staring
the
stout
woman
became
less
cautious
and
more
communicative
as
am
own
husband
cousin
to
maggie
and
when
she
telled
me
of
miss
craigie
being
down
puir
body
wi
the
influenzy
and
the
young
leddy
not
to
gang
near
the
hoose
for
fear
o
carrying
the
infection
to
her
braw
new
schule
oh
is
miss
craigie
ill
i
sorry
joey
cried
out
the
temperature
being
one
hundred
and
four
forbye
some
points
up
which
i
canna
mind
exactly
i
douting
she
for
the
pewmonia
and
twa
in
the
next
hoose
abune
lying
deed
of
the
same
the
stout
woman
mentioned
with
a
certain
gloomy
satisfaction
that
puzzled
joey
and
says
i
to
maggie
take
the
young
leddy
says
i
what
chances
not
tak
the
infection
awa
wi
her
thank
you
that
awfully
kind
joey
said
politely
though
mournfully
she
explained
to
tresham
who
looked
somewhat
mystified
by
the
flood
of
broad
scotch
you
poor
child
i
should
like
to
take
you
with
me
to
my
hotel
for
but
i
suppose
i
hardly
could
as
i
am
staying
with
a
friend
there
but
i
do
like
this
for
you
have
you
authority
from
miss
craigie
she
asked
suddenly
turning
to
maggie
own
cousin
as
though
she
rather
hoped
for
a
negative
answer
but
there
was
no
escape
maggie
kinswoman
dived
promptly
into
a
black
knitted
bag
that
she
carried
and
produced
a
sheet
of
paper
scrawled
in
pencil
i
am
so
sorry
but
i
may
not
see
you
joey
nicol
will
take
care
of
you
and
put
you
into
your
train
good
luck
jean
craigie
there
was
no
help
for
it
joey
shook
hands
with
kind
tresham
and
thanked
her
and
walked
off
beside
nicol
in
the
wake
of
a
huge
outside
porter
who
wheeled
her
trunk
on
a
barrow
they
came
up
into
the
width
and
glare
of
princes
street
crossed
it
turned
up
a
narrower
street
running
at
right
angles
to
it
went
down
still
following
the
porter
and
turned
into
another
narrower
still
where
narrow
wynds
or
passages
showed
between
the
immensely
tall
old
houses
in
this
street
nicol
stopped
at
last
produced
a
and
opened
the
door
into
a
hall
made
dimly
visible
by
a
glimmer
only
of
gas
ye
be
pleased
to
mount
miss
she
said
unsmilingly
joey
mounted
four
flights
of
stairs
all
covered
with
slippery
linoleum
till
she
landed
at
last
in
a
room
which
looked
as
though
no
one
could
ever
have
laughed
in
it
from
the
time
the
house
was
built
four
wooden
chairs
stood
against
the
walls
a
square
table
covered
with
a
mottled
brown
cloth
stood
exactly
in
the
centre
a
cheap
crudely
coloured
print
of
the
last
sleep
of
argyle
above
the
was
the
sole
attempt
at
ornament
unless
one
counted
the
dim
cruets
which
occupied
for
the
want
of
a
the
centre
of
the
dingy
and
once
mantelpiece
the
room
was
at
once
cold
and
stuffy
ye
be
taking
your
supper
here
miss
and
then
ye
shall
gang
to
your
bed
nicol
informed
her
and
joey
seeing
nothing
whatever
to
stay
up
for
agreed
meekly
it
was
not
the
evening
she
had
pictured
to
herself
but
she
must
make
the
best
of
it
she
wrote
a
pencil
post
card
to
mums
while
nicol
laid
the
table
and
set
before
her
a
rather
gristly
chop
in
which
she
mentioned
that
the
journey
had
been
all
right
and
she
herself
was
all
right
too
it
seemed
better
not
to
mention
miss
craigie
illness
and
this
rather
desolate
reception
when
she
happened
to
be
one
of
those
five
children
who
had
promised
father
to
take
care
of

iii
the
duties
of
a
scholarship
kid
she
be
there
i
suppose
why
should
she
you
mugwump
a
scholarship
kid
wo
have
an
entrance
exam
like
an
ordinary
new
girl
i
wish
to
goodness
the
redlands
trustees
had
never
thought
of
the
old
scholarship
idea
grumbled
a
third
voice
mary
hertford
was
rather
the
limit
was
she
at
least
when
she
was
in
the
lower
school
setting
the
pace
so
frightfully
fast
specially
in
maths
but
at
least
mary
was
our
own
sort
i
do
call
it
playing
the
game
to
shove
village
schoolgirls
among
us
syb
you
do
mean
it
i
do
miss
wakefield
told
mother
the
lamb
had
had
a
letter
from
her
dear
miss
craigie
i
fancy
and
in
her
joy
went
bleating
round
to
everyone
fact
this
scholarship
kid
was
the
priceless
gem
from
some
village
school
how
putrid
what
on
earth
are
we
to
do
with
her
put
up
with
her
i
suppose
noreen
my
good
child
what
else
do
you
suppose
we
can
do
wish
to
goodness
i
had
worked
so
beastly
hard
last
term
reward
remove
ii
b
and
the
company
of
this
village
kid
it
sure
to
be
in
remove
ii
with
scholarship
think
she
say
for
say
and
drop
her
she
scotch
not
cockney
you
cuckoo
and
probably
quite
harmless
someone
else
chimed
in
but
i
should
have
thought
the
grammar
school
a
bit
more
her
line
however
to
redlands
she
coming
and
at
redlands
she
presumably
stay
and
we
shall
have
to
make
the
best
of
it
and
of
her
groaned
the
girl
called
syb
there
was
a
silence
for
the
little
group
of
girls
in
the
corridor
had
to
make
room
for
some
indignant
to
pass
out
from
the
compartment
in
the
corner
of
which
joey
was
wedged
unable
without
putting
her
fingers
into
her
ears
and
so
drawing
undesired
attention
to
herself
to
help
overhearing
the
chief
part
of
this
conversation
these
girls
had
joined
the
train
at
lincoln
where
joey
in
accordance
with
instructions
had
changed
for
the
local
line
and
the
train
had
been
so
full
that
these
girls
had
never
bothered
to
find
a
seat
at
all
but
stood
in
a
tight
bunch
in
the
corridor
talking
loudly
to
make
themselves
heard
above
the
roar
of
the
train
they
were
redlands
girls
joey
would
have
known
that
by
their
uniform
if
she
had
by
their
talk
it
had
taken
her
a
minute
or
two
to
tell
what
they
meant
by
village
schoolgirls
when
she
did
her
face
grew
hot
and
she
stared
defiantly
towards
them
they
were
outsiders
themselves
thought
joey
to
talk
like
that
about
a
girl
who
was
coming
to
redlands
even
if
she
had
been
to
a
different
sort
of
school
before
but
though
the
thinking
it
was
certainly
a
relief
it
could
not
quite
do
away
with
the
sore
hurt
feeling
evidently
the
redlands
girls
were
not
inclined
to
start
friends
it
was
all
the
harder
to
bear
because
they
were
such
girls
the
one
called
noreen
was
extremely
pretty
with
lovely
eyes
under
black
eyebrows
and
a
wealth
of
dark
hair
and
even
syb
was
with
a
bright
colour
and
a
straight
determined
figure
the
girl
who
had
spoken
last
was
short
and
insignificant
with
bobbed
hair
but
her
eyes
were
very
bright
and
her
smile
infectious
joey
settled
while
the
other
two
were
a
couple
much
too
nice
in
appearance
for
the
sentiments
they
had
been
expressing
joey
was
to
have
an
opportunity
for
studying
them
more
closely
in
a
minute
for
apparently
they
had
had
enough
of
standing
in
the
corridor
and
came
pouring
into
her
compartment
so
soon
as
the
other
passengers
had
poured
out
they
did
trouble
even
to
put
their
hockey
sticks
in
the
rack
by
which
joey
guessed
that
mote
deep
the
station
for
redlands
was
not
far
away
the
one
called
syb
caught
sight
of
joey
as
they
came
in
hullo
she
said
hullo
joey
answered
not
being
sure
what
to
answer
new
kid
are
you
yes
what
your
name
asked
noreen
jo
jocelyn
graham
noreen
shot
a
quick
glance
at
syb
where
do
you
come
from
scotland
joey
did
not
feel
inclined
to
be
communicative
you
not
the
scholarship
kid
are
you
by
any
chance
demanded
the
girl
with
the
bobbed
hair
yes
oh
murder
i
did
think
you
were
somehow
did
you
think
i
was
going
to
look
so
awfully
unlike
everybody
else
joey
demanded
in
her
turn
she
could
not
quite
keep
the
hurt
tone
out
of
her
voice
though
she
tried
no
why
should
we
the
girl
with
the
bobbed
hair
answered
a
shade
uncomfortably
and
then
they
all
looked
at
each
other
and
there
was
an
awkward
little
pause
noreen
broke
it
speaking
in
a
more
friendly
tone
than
any
of
them
had
done
yet
i
suppose
you
had
someone
to
put
you
up
to
what
scholarship
girls
have
to
do
at
redlands
no
joey
was
not
expansive
suspecting
some
covert
allusion
to
that
village
school
which
appeared
so
upsetting
to
these
very
select
redlanders
oh
did
they
noreen
blue
eyes
met
hers
gravely
and
joey
fancied
sympathetically
it
was
rather
difficult
to
ask
any
favours
of
girls
who
despised
her
but
miss
craigie
was
far
away
in
edinburgh
wrestling
with
the
influenza
poor
miss
craigie
and
clearly
she
was
on
the
edge
of
one
of
those
pitfalls
that
lie
in
wait
for
new
girls
if
it
would
be
a
bother
perhaps
you
would
tell
me
what
i
have
to
do
she
asked
noreen
leaned
forward
confidentially
of
course
i
will
there
not
much
to
tell
just
two
or
three
little
things
that
are
always
done
by
the
scholarship
winner
the
others
all
displayed
a
sudden
and
flattering
interest
in
joey
they
leaned
forward
too
so
as
not
to
miss
a
word
tidying
the
lab
is
the
most
important
thing
noreen
went
on
gravely
we
got
a
jolly
old
french
stinks
professor
monsieur
trouville
frightfully
brainy
over
stinks
but
untidy
oh
my
sunday
hat
and
dublin
castle
untidy
is
the
word
for
it
joey
tried
to
grasp
the
situation
valiantly
do
i
sweep
or
dust
or
wash
up
his
messes
or
what
she
asked
the
girl
with
the
bobbed
hair
coughed
alarmingly
syb
thumped
her
back
and
said
shut
it
barbara
noreen
seemed
a
little
taken
aback
by
this
question
no
you
do
i
think
and
anyhow
you
empty
messes
out
of
one
saucer
into
another
or
you
probably
blow
up
the
coll
she
stated
candidly
you
just
put
bottles
into
the
cupboards
and
do
take
any
notice
if
he
tells
you
to
get
out
and
boil
yourself
he
does
say
these
sort
of
things
he
a
beast
of
a
temper
noreen
added
kindly
when
do
i
begin
joey
asked
tidying
the
lab
well
i
should
waste
any
time
syb
chimed
in
as
soon
as
you
get
to
redlands
i
should
say
anyone
would
show
you
where
it
is
righto
joey
told
them
with
outward
cheerfulness
though
inward
tremors
anything
else
noreen
blue
eyes
had
an
odd
gleam
not
much
you
lace
up
the
senior
prefect
boots
she
is
ingrid
latimer
and
and
write
out
the
supper
menus
for
cook
shrieked
joey
oh
do
you
remember
noreen
they
stopped
that
because
mary
hertford
wrote
like
a
diseased
spider
syb
contributed
the
scholarship
kid
only
only
she
choked
you
not
having
me
on
demanded
joey
my
dear
kid
go
to
the
lab
when
you
get
there
and
see
if
we
are
the
train
stopped
mote
deep
flashed
before
their
eyes
the
station
for
redlands
was
reached
joey
grasped
her
things
and
asked
no
further
questions
she
was
there
she
stood
forlornly
by
her
on
the
platform
while
the
rest
fell
upon
some
other
girls
waiting
for
them
there
joey
stood
apart
noreen
seemed
to
be
telling
some
story
in
an
emphatic
whisper
a
funny
story
evidently
for
everybody
shrieked
with
laughter
except
one
freckled
girl
who
said
lazily
what
a
shame
and
looked
towards
joey
as
though
she
had
half
a
mind
to
come
and
speak
to
her
joey
hoped
that
she
would
but
she
did
it
was
syb
who
came
at
last
when
all
the
luggage
had
been
got
out
and
piled
in
the
rather
ancient
cabs
which
still
did
duty
in
little
holland
we
going
to
walk
jocelyn
of
course
you
can
come
with
us
if
you
like
but
considering
all
the
extra
things
a
scholarship
kid
has
to
start
with
you
better
cab
it
joey
was
proud
and
the
inference
was
rather
plain
they
did
want
her
company
i
should
have
cabbed
it
anyhow
i
rather
she
told
syb
with
decision
and
walked
off
in
the
direction
of
the
cabs
her
head
held
very
high
she
got
into
the
first
and
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
rather
mildewy
cushions
trying
to
face
things
out
it
was
all
rather
different
from
what
she
had
pictured
but
mums
need
know
that
and
she
have
to
worry
about
the
girls
and
their
unfriendly
ways
at
present
anyhow
for
she
had
the
lab
to
put
tidy
and
afterwards
that
other
unknown
terror
the
lacing
up
of
the
head
girl
boots
if
only
she
could
have
travelled
with
miss
craigie
or
someone
friendly
she
could
have
asked
how
and
when
all
these
things
were
done
but
father
had
always
said
do
grouse
over
what
might
have
been
get
on
to
what
is
what
is
appeared
to
be
tidying
the
lab
for
the
french
professor
joey
settled
to
get
on
to
that
at
once
the
cab
was
jolting
along
a
flat
marsh
road
that
lay
between
a
rolling
sea
of
green
the
real
sea
was
not
visible
for
a
white
mist
lay
on
the
horizon
but
the
taste
and
the
tang
on
her
lips
was
salt
and
there
was
a
wonderful
sense
of
space
and
freshness
around
her
nothing
broke
the
flatness
of
the
landscape
but
here
and
there
a
squat
church
tower
in
the
midst
of
a
cluster
of
cottages
presently
another
tower
drew
her
attention
a
tall
gaunt
tower
seeming
like
a
warning
uplifted
finger
raising
itself
in
the
peaceful
sea
of
green
as
if
to
say
watch
joey
wondered
what
its
story
might
be
she
craned
her
head
out
of
the
cab
window
to
look
back
at
it
long
after
it
was
receding
into
distance
and
was
so
absorbed
in
it
that
she
was
taken
by
surprise
when
the
cab
stopped
before
high
ornamented
iron
gates
and
the
cabman
shouted
something
indistinguishable
a
woman
ran
out
and
swung
the
great
gates
back
this
was
redlands
joey
began
to
feel
a
little
quaky
though
she
tried
to
pretend
it
was
all
rather
fun
the
pretence
was
very
successful
at
that
moment
but
at
least
she
knew
what
was
expected
of
her
on
arrival
that
was
a
decided
comfort
she
looked
before
her
with
quite
as
much
interest
as
she
looked
behind
while
the
cab
crawled
down
the
long
straight
drive
towards
the
irregular
mass
of
dim
red
brick
veiled
in
ivy
architecturally
redlands
college
left
something
to
be
desired
as
it
had
been
altered
and
added
to
at
different
times
by
people
of
widely
differing
views
but
the
whole
had
been
mellowed
together
in
a
district
where
even
new
red
brick
hardly
stares
above
a
month
and
presented
to
its
world
a
silent
solid
dignity
joe
looked
from
the
original
redlands
an
early
seventeenth
century
manor
house
to
the
wing
built
on
by
madame
hèrbert
who
kept
a
flourishing
school
for
young
ladies
of
quality
in
the
stormy
days
of
the
second
james
and
on
to
the
additions
of
two
centuries
later
and
the
swimming
bath
gymnasium
and
laboratories
marking
the
further
requirements
of
the
twentieth
century
and
the
march
of
education
joey
was
no
authority
on
architecture
however
and
did
not
come
to
know
all
this
till
she
had
been
some
days
at
redlands
just
then
she
merely
thought
that
the
place
looked
jolly
though
about
twice
as
big
as
she
had
expected
the
cab
drew
up
before
the
flight
of
steps
leading
to
the
front
door
joey
jumped
out
a
highly
superior
appeared
before
she
had
time
to
ring
the
bell
probably
she
had
heard
the
crunching
of
the
many
cab
wheels
on
the
gravel
joey
spoke
at
once
please
could
you
direct
me
to
the
chemical
lab
they
told
me
to
go
there
at
once
the
maid
looked
a
little
surprised
miss
conyngham
will
be
back
soon
miss
she
said
hesitatingly
had
you
better
wait
i
was
told
to
go
there
joe
said
firmly
and
the
maid
pointed
to
a
building
on
the
right
rather
behind
the
main
block
that
the
lab
miss
but
unless
the
professor
is
there
you
wo
be
able
to
go
in
it
locked
i
try
anyhow
joey
told
her
and
walked
off
in
the
direction
pointed
out
she
went
up
two
steps
to
the
door
of
the
lab
joey
went
up
them
cautiously
as
when
they
played
at
home
and
somebody
was
likely
to
spring
out
and
catch
you
but
no
furious
professor
sprang
and
joey
tried
the
door
and
found
it
was
locked
but
on
the
outside
so
she
turned
the
key
and
went
in
with
the
words
please
i
come
to
tidy
ready
on
her
lips
but
there
was
no
one
to
whom
to
say
them
the
lab
was
quite
empty
though
it
certainly
looked
as
though
it
had
not
been
empty
for
long
bottles
stood
upon
a
table
and
two
or
three
saucers
containing
various
powders
and
a
large
scented
silk
handkerchief
of
violet
hue
lay
on
the
floor
beside
a
dark
closet
with
open
door
joey
began
to
tidy
as
well
as
she
could
she
used
her
handkerchief
for
a
duster
and
presently
finding
it
rather
small
took
up
the
violet
one
which
was
already
tolerably
dirty
and
therefore
might
be
dirtier
without
mattering
she
thought
she
did
not
put
the
bottles
away
in
case
the
professor
should
come
back
and
want
them
but
she
took
them
off
the
table
and
dusted
it
and
then
put
them
back
in
orderly
rows
the
saucers
she
wisely
did
not
touch
except
to
dust
underneath
them
then
she
attacked
the
dark
closet
which
was
surrounded
by
shelves
holding
innumerable
saucers
trays
bottles
and
boxes
a
good
many
of
these
things
were
on
the
floor
joey
rammed
her
dusters
into
the
pockets
of
her
coat
and
set
to
work
to
find
a
safer
for
them
she
was
really
interested
by
now
in
this
duty
which
had
been
thrust
upon
her
in
right
of
her
scholarship
so
absorbed
indeed
that
she
never
heard
an
exclamation
at
the
door
and
a
quick
step
across
the
room
she
noticed
nothing
till
the
door
of
the
closet
was
wrenched
violently
wide
and
she
sprang
round
to
find
herself
looking
into
the
furious
light
eyes
of
the
french
professor
chapter
iv
enter
gabrielle
he
was
a
short
man
this
monsieur
trouville
neat
and
dapper
though
inclined
to
be
fat
his
high
forehead
peaked
up
to
his
receding
hair
his
short
moustache
was
stiffly
waxed
and
stood
out
very
black
against
his
pallid
face
he
was
not
but
just
at
that
moment
joey
thought
she
had
never
seen
anyone
quite
so
unpleasant
he
caught
her
by
the
arm
what
are
you
doing
here
how
dare
you
come
do
you
not
know
it
is
forbidden
except
when
i
take
the
classes
here
i
will
report
you
to
miss
conyngham
you
shall
be
expelled
joey
stood
her
ground
you
ca
expel
people
when
they
only
just
come
she
assured
him
stoutly
it
is
done
besides
i
all
right
to
tidy
here
i
the
scholarship
girl
this
last
statement
did
not
appear
to
mitigate
monsieur
fury
in
the
least
you
have
distairbed
all
my
bottles
you
have
made
for
me
hours
of
work
with
your
disobedience
he
snarled
i
vill
have
you
punished
you
shall
be
no
more
at
redlands
he
began
to
cast
about
the
room
like
a
nosing
for
a
trail
joey
felt
rather
frightened
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
monsieur
trouville
was
really
angry
he
spluttered
out
the
objurgations
in
his
strong
french
accent
rather
like
an
angry
cat
somehow
in
spite
of
what
noreen
and
syb
had
said
she
had
not
expected
him
to
be
quite
so
much
annoyed
by
her
presence
i
awfully
sorry
if
i
mixed
your
bottles
she
told
him
trying
to
speak
steadily
i
did
mean
to
perhaps
some
time
when
not
too
busy
you
would
just
show
me
how
you
like
things
tidied
and
then
monsieur
trouville
made
three
strides
towards
her
with
so
menacing
an
expression
that
joey
gave
back
a
step
in
spite
of
herself
miss
conyngham
tell
you
to
say
dat
he
demanded
no
of
course
not
do
you
suppose
one
needs
to
be
polite
joey
answered
growing
angry
in
her
turn
if
you
do
want
your
old
lab
tidied
for
you
i
sure
i
do
want
to
do
it
illustration
how
dare
you
come
and
joey
departed
with
all
the
dignity
that
she
could
muster
though
she
felt
a
good
deal
more
like
crying
the
professor
suspicious
attitude
was
rather
hurting
he
could
have
been
a
worse
beast
if
he
thought
i
meant
to
steal
his
bottles
she
told
herself
she
was
back
towards
the
front
door
before
she
discovered
she
stolen
something
from
the
lab
after
all
fumbling
for
the
handkerchief
which
was
rather
badly
wanted
at
that
moment
she
brought
out
a
curiously
unfamiliar
one
of
violet
silk
now
excessively
grubby
she
looked
at
it
with
dismay
what
would
the
professor
do
if
she
went
back
and
told
him
that
to
add
to
her
other
offences
she
had
used
his
handkerchief
for
a
duster
i
better
wash
it
first
before
i
return
it
joey
said
to
herself
and
rammed
it
back
into
her
pocket
she
wondered
whether
noreen
and
the
others
had
turned
up
yet
it
would
be
satisfactory
to
tell
them
that
she
had
done
the
lab
already
joey
thought
that
she
would
not
say
anything
about
the
professor
fury
which
after
all
had
been
unjust
she
put
her
head
down
and
raced
at
her
best
pace
for
the
front
door
it
would
be
rather
fun
to
talk
as
though
the
professor
had
been
quite
pleased
with
her
tidying
phut
joey
had
gone
full
tilt
into
someone
who
was
coming
from
the
house
a
very
tall
girl
with
her
hair
tied
back
here
look
where
you
going
you
young
idiot
the
big
girl
called
out
angrily
joey
came
to
earth
metaphorically
with
a
bump
i
say
i
frightfully
sorry
did
i
hurt
you
that
not
likely
considering
you
half
my
size
said
the
tall
girl
but
you
should
look
what
your
name
jocelyn
graham
what
yours
the
tall
girl
frowned
i
am
ingrid
latimer
senior
prefect
here
she
said
coldly
and
joey
understood
that
she
had
done
the
wrong
thing
in
asking
that
question
she
became
rather
flustered
oh
are
you
then
when
do
you
want
your
boots
put
on
she
asked
nervously
ingrid
frowned
more
alarmingly
what
on
earth
are
you
talking
about
i
got
the
scholarship
do
i
have
to
put
your
boots
on
faltered
joey
now
she
came
to
put
it
into
words
it
did
sound
an
extremely
silly
thing
to
say
somehow
she
was
surprised
by
the
crushing
tone
of
the
senior
prefect
answer
please
do
try
to
be
funny
we
no
use
for
that
sort
of
thing
here
who
put
you
up
to
all
this
a
light
began
to
break
upon
joey
something
hot
surged
in
her
chest
ought
i
to
have
tidied
the
lab
either
she
asked
with
the
courage
of
desperation
tidied
the
lab
why
no
one
allowed
there
without
monsieur
or
the
chemistry
mistress
look
here
my
good
child
are
you
trying
to
be
funny
i
should
because
it
wo
pay
you
or
are
you
the
outsidest
edge
of
imbecile
new
kids
that
ever
came
to
redlands
joey
was
silent
she
was
trying
to
adjust
things
in
her
mind
the
girls
had
had
her
on
and
oh
how
easily
she
the
outsidest
edge
in
imbeciles
she
supposed
who
put
you
up
to
all
this
repeated
the
senior
prefect
magisterially
joey
stuck
her
hands
into
her
pockets
she
had
been
made
a
fool
of
well
it
was
pleasant
but
one
must
grin
and
bear
it
even
the
hateful
apologising
to
the
justly
incensed
professor
which
she
supposed
must
be
her
next
proceeding
she
was
going
to
get
the
others
into
trouble
anyway
and
ingrid
latimer
tone
suggested
trouble
ahead
oh
never
mind
she
said
i
wish
to
know
ingrid
repeated
their
names
please
sorry
it
ca
be
done
joey
stuck
out
hardily
and
if
you
want
your
boots
put
on
i
go
please
the
senior
prefect
looked
as
though
she
could
hardly
believe
her
ears
but
joey
had
been
educated
up
to
senior
prefects
and
their
expressions
she
bolted
straight
back
to
the
lab
it
would
be
best
to
get
that
hateful
apology
over
at
once
but
the
door
was
locked
this
time
on
the
inside
and
though
she
knocked
till
her
knuckles
were
sore
there
was
no
answer
hi
jocelyn
graham
you
to
go
to
miss
conyngham
shouted
a
familiar
voice
and
noreen
hove
in
sight
round
the
corner
joey
saw
her
opportunity
tell
that
to
some
other
idiot
if
you
can
find
one
silly
enough
to
listen
to
the
sort
of
things
you
say
she
told
her
personally
i
find
it
jolly
interesting
to
see
what
a
kid
like
you
will
try
on
next
but
even
i
do
want
too
much
funniness
thank
you
she
marched
off
leaving
an
outraged
and
astounded
noreen
staring
after
her
and
betook
herself
to
the
sleepy
stream
meandering
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
it
was
a
comfort
to
feel
that
noreen
had
not
succeeded
in
having
her
on
a
third
time
but
it
was
about
all
the
comfort
there
was
joey
felt
desperately
and
miserable
just
then
and
as
if
she
would
give
anything
in
the
world
to
find
herself
on
the
heathy
moor
or
making
bannocks
for
tea
in
the
kitchen
of
the
little
grey
stone
cottage
far
away
from
this
puzzling
and
unfriendly
new
world
she
stared
across
the
sleepy
water
wondering
whether
father
had
felt
more
wretched
than
this
when
he
was
a
prisoner
among
his
enemies
yes
of
course
it
had
been
worse
for
him
a
great
deal
worse
for
he
had
been
in
the
midst
of
dirt
and
and
barbarities
unspeakable
only
he
had
expected
to
find
the
huns
friendly
gentlemen
and
joey
had
somehow
expected
a
great
deal
from
redlands
still
that
was
no
reason
for
making
a
fuss
father
had
joey
knew
that
she
screwed
her
eyes
up
tight
and
rubbed
the
back
of
a
grubby
hand
across
them
fiercely
and
while
she
was
doing
that
someone
spoke
to
her
i
say
are
you
jocelyn
graham
joey
opened
her
eyes
hastily
a
girl
was
standing
by
her
a
girl
with
long
lovely
hair
and
clear
eyes
a
shade
darker
and
a
delicate
clear
skin
she
was
as
tall
as
joey
herself
anything
like
and
she
had
the
superior
way
of
talking
which
joey
had
noticed
in
the
rest
you
jocelyn
are
you
this
girl
went
on
and
joey
liked
her
way
of
saying
it
for
it
was
friendly
well
do
let
me
take
you
to
miss
conyngham
yes
it
all
right
she
really
wants
you
and
she
sent
for
you
some
time
ago
you
know
joey
remembered
panic
took
hold
of
her
will
she
be
mad
the
pretty
girl
smiled
she
seeing
the
other
new
girls
you
be
all
right
if
we
run
they
ran
somehow
joey
did
not
doubt
this
new
friend
what
your
name
she
asked
breathlessly
as
they
tore
up
from
the
stream
and
across
the
gardens
gabrielle
gabrielle
arden
why
did
you
come
after
me
joey
asked
oh
noreen
thought
you
had
gone
down
that
way
it
was
decent
of
you
joey
said
with
conviction
jocelyn
noreen
and
the
others
did
mean
anything
truly
gabrielle
panted
they
did
think
you
would
really
go
and
do
the
lab
you
know
joey
returned
no
answer
for
one
thing
she
had
no
breath
to
speak
for
the
second
she
looked
forward
to
a
settlement
a
little
later
on
with
noreen
and
when
the
interview
with
miss
conyngham
and
the
hateful
apology
to
the
professor
were
well
over
gabrielle
said
nothing
more
either
and
the
two
arrived
in
silence
at
miss
conyngham
door
miss
conyngham
herself
opened
it
shepherding
out
three
girls
who
looked
new
and
rather
frightened
ah
gabrielle
that
right
miss
conyngham
said
kathleen
ronaldshay
has
no
elder
sisters
here
will
you
take
care
of
her
and
show
her
round
and
here
is
jocelyn
i
will
introduce
all
you
new
girls
to
each
other
and
then
i
want
a
little
talk
with
jocelyn
alone
joey
shook
hands
with
bernadine
elton
kathleen
ronaldshay
and
ella
marne
then
the
three
were
sent
off
in
gabrielle
care
they
were
all
of
them
much
bigger
than
she
was
and
miss
conyngham
drew
jocelyn
into
her
pretty
room
miss
conyngham
matched
her
room
she
was
dainty
and
fair
and
and
as
joey
mentioned
afterwards
to
mums
looked
as
if
a
light
were
burning
inside
her
which
made
her
all
lit
up
as
soon
as
she
began
to
talk
she
did
not
look
as
though
she
could
keep
six
hundred
girls
in
order
but
joey
found
out
very
soon
that
appearances
were
deceitful
in
this
case
just
now
however
miss
conyngham
was
not
out
to
keep
anyone
in
order
i
was
so
sorry
that
you
and
miss
craigie
could
come
down
together
but
i
have
had
a
wire
she
is
better
and
the
temperature
very
much
down
this
morning
so
i
hope
we
may
get
her
back
in
a
fortnight
and
by
that
time
i
expect
you
will
have
made
hosts
of
friends
and
have
a
tremendous
amount
to
tell
her
joey
assented
cautiously
privately
she
doubted
the
friends
and
it
certainly
would
be
possible
to
tell
miss
craigie
that
she
hated
redlands
for
fear
it
should
go
back
to
mums
the
minister
but
an
assent
of
some
kind
seemed
the
proper
thing
you
will
be
placed
in
remove
ii
b
that
is
the
head
form
of
the
lower
school
miss
conyngham
went
on
gabrielle
who
brought
you
here
is
in
that
form
only
she
is
a
she
is
head
of
the
lower
school
you
know
and
only
thirteen
we
are
all
proud
of
gabrielle
at
redlands
is
she
top
of
this
remove
place
then
asked
joey
not
necessarily
the
head
of
the
lower
school
is
chosen
from
remove
but
it
is
in
open
election
among
the
other
girls
they
vote
for
the
best
in
every
way
out
of
sixty
remove
girls
you
want
a
great
many
qualities
to
be
head
of
the
lower
school
jocelyn
joey
was
interested
she
somehow
had
guessed
that
gabrielle
was
anything
special
except
to
a
new
girl
the
election
of
the
head
girl
for
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
of
the
upper
school
and
for
the
three
hundred
and
fifty
of
the
lower
happens
at
the
end
of
every
year
miss
conyngham
went
on
in
a
nice
companionable
way
as
though
she
were
quite
sure
that
joey
would
be
interested
and
feel
the
school
matters
her
own
it
is
a
very
serious
affair
i
can
assure
you
the
result
of
the
election
holds
good
for
the
whole
succeeding
year
at
christmas
gabrielle
will
stand
for
that
is
if
she
does
pass
out
of
remove
into
the
upper
school
by
the
end
of
the
term
all
this
will
have
come
to
mean
a
very
great
deal
to
you
i
think
joey
assent
was
again
a
model
of
caution
of
course
miss
conyngham
did
realise
how
the
girls
resented
that
village
school
probably
gabrielle
had
just
been
nice
because
she
did
not
know
well
now
it
must
be
miss
conyngham
concluded
and
you
must
go
and
have
tea
give
matron
your
keys
afterwards
and
she
will
show
you
where
to
put
away
your
clothes
miss
conyngham
consulted
a
list
pinned
on
her
wall
you
are
in
blue
dormitory
i
see
that
is
a
very
favourite
one
i
will
ask
gabrielle
to
introduce
you
to
your
sybil
gray
barbara
emerson
and
noreen
i
think
you
will
all
get
on
very
comfortably
together
joey
did
not
even
give
a
cautious
assent
to
this
she
thought
she
knew
exactly
how
that
quartette
were
going
to
get
on
she
just
said
thank
you
miss
conyngham
miss
conyngham
rang
the
bell
twice
a
minute
later
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
and
gabrielle
answered
her
come
in
take
jocelyn
in
to
tea
and
show
her
her
dormitory
gabrielle
please
miss
conyngham
said
she
did
not
add
take
care
of
her
for
which
joey
was
grateful
it
was
bad
enough
to
be
disliked
by
the
rest
but
at
least
she
need
be
despised
no
one
should
guess
that
she
feeling
happy
at
redlands
which
dorm
are
you
in
gabrielle
asked
as
soon
as
miss
door
was
shut
behind
them
blue
joey
said
briefly
that
topping
it
next
door
to
mine
and
such
a
jolly
set
there
i
know
joey
interrupted
rather
grimly
sybil
and
barbara
and
noreen
do
you
know
them
then
asked
gabrielle
surprised
we
met
in
the
train
joey
explained
she
hesitated
for
a
second
i
shall
being
in
their
dorm
chapter
v
liveliness
in
blue
dorm
tea
was
over
a
tea
which
seemed
a
babel
to
joey
unaccustomed
ears
although
cousin
greta
would
probably
have
laughed
at
the
term
unaccustomed
considering
the
noise
that
the
five
grahams
could
make
among
themselves
but
cousin
greta
would
never
have
guessed
what
a
great
school
could
do
at
the
first
meal
with
discipline
relaxed
and
everybody
trying
to
tell
special
friends
how
they
had
spent
the
holidays
joey
sat
under
the
wing
of
a
very
young
mistress
who
wore
a
great
bunch
of
violets
in
her
belt
and
was
addressed
as
miss
lambton
she
saw
to
it
that
joey
had
plenty
of
bread
and
jam
and
cake
and
addressed
two
or
three
questions
to
her
but
it
was
in
the
nature
of
things
that
the
new
girl
should
feel
rather
out
of
it
when
all
near
neighbours
wanted
to
tell
miss
lambton
where
they
had
been
and
what
they
had
done
and
she
had
to
interrupt
her
adorers
in
order
to
speak
to
joey
gabrielle
had
been
swamped
directly
they
came
into
the
huge
refectory
by
two
vehement
people
with
a
tiny
silver
shield
fastened
to
their
djibbahs
who
assured
her
vociferously
that
she
had
promised
to
sit
between
them
for
the
first
tea
last
term
however
she
remembered
the
new
girl
directly
tea
was
over
and
made
her
way
to
joey
side
when
the
girls
rose
from
table
will
you
come
to
your
dorm
now
i
got
to
go
and
say
something
to
the
professor
in
lab
joey
said
doubtfully
not
being
at
all
sure
that
when
she
reached
blue
dorm
she
would
be
expected
to
stay
there
interviewing
matron
or
something
of
that
kind
oh
come
on
gabrielle
if
the
new
kid
does
to
be
shown
her
dormitory
do
fag
over
her
urged
two
or
three
impatient
voices
but
gabrielle
stood
her
ground
i
quite
forgot
ingrid
latimer
she
senior
prefect
of
course
you
do
know
her
yet
sent
me
a
message
for
you
she
said
the
lab
was
all
right
and
she
had
seen
monsieur
trouville
i
do
know
what
it
means
but
perhaps
you
do
yes
i
know
joey
answered
shortly
it
had
been
kind
of
the
senior
prefect
to
face
the
furious
professor
for
her
and
gabrielle
seemed
kind
and
friendly
too
but
you
could
tell
about
these
girls
they
despised
her
because
of
calgarloch
school
and
she
never
knew
when
they
would
have
set
her
on
about
something
else
she
did
feel
inclined
to
be
effusive
gabrielle
shook
off
her
admirers
and
conducted
joey
up
many
stairs
and
along
many
passages
in
silence
only
when
she
had
opened
the
door
of
a
large
light
airy
room
with
walls
and
blue
quilts
to
the
four
beds
and
blue
curtains
to
the
windows
did
she
find
her
voice
again
this
is
blue
dorm
jocelyn
i
sure
you
like
it
is
it
a
topping
view
look
how
well
you
can
see
the
fossdyke
wash
and
the
walpole
fen
all
down
on
the
right
it
reclaimed
you
know
and
do
you
see
that
tower
yes
i
saw
it
coming
along
what
is
it
asked
joey
coming
a
little
more
out
of
her
shell
gabrielle
sunk
her
voice
to
an
impressive
whisper
it
haunted
it
is
really
jocelyn
of
course
miss
conyngham
and
the
sensible
people
would
say
nonsense
but
we
heard
awfully
queer
sounds
sometimes
and
once
i
saw
some
blue
light
with
my
own
eyes
when
doron
westerby
another
four
had
this
dorm
last
term
had
toothache
in
the
night
and
called
me
you
know
a
man
was
murdered
there
ages
back
it
was
his
enemy
tied
him
up
in
an
underground
room
of
the
tower
and
then
blew
out
a
bit
of
the
at
one
of
the
great
autumn
tides
joey
gasped
how
beastly
are
his
mouldering
bones
there
now
i
think
they
cleared
up
gabrielle
said
regretfully
you
look
for
the
light
jocelyn
you
have
a
topping
chance
i
wonder
which
bed
you
have
three
have
windows
you
see
it
only
in
that
fourth
one
by
the
door
you
ca
see
anything
and
i
do
think
it
fixed
yet
who
sleeps
there
as
if
in
answer
to
her
words
there
was
a
stampede
outside
and
the
three
other
owners
of
blue
dorm
rushed
headlong
in
each
carried
something
in
her
hand
a
book
a
comb
a
handkerchief
with
one
consent
they
rushed
upon
the
three
window
beds
and
hurling
the
article
upon
it
shouted
breathlessly
bags
i
this
gabrielle
got
rather
red
she
walked
up
to
syb
and
spoke
in
a
low
voice
joey
caught
the
words
a
new
girl
and
playing
up
but
whatever
her
appeal
might
be
it
had
much
effect
joey
marched
over
to
the
bed
by
the
door
this
is
mine
then
she
said
matron
came
in
a
minute
later
in
her
usual
hurry
demanding
keys
and
everyone
attention
instantly
gabrielle
was
dispatched
to
the
big
basement
room
downstairs
to
help
in
the
unpacking
and
putting
away
of
her
things
and
joey
found
she
was
expected
to
do
the
same
after
matron
had
shown
her
exactly
where
and
how
her
things
should
go
and
explained
that
there
was
a
dormitory
inspection
inside
and
out
of
drawers
and
cupboards
every
saturday
of
term
joey
ran
upstairs
with
armfuls
of
clothes
and
downstairs
to
get
more
for
a
long
time
after
that
but
at
last
everything
was
put
away
and
matron
weary
and
a
trifle
dishevelled
made
a
tour
of
inspection
before
going
to
see
the
babies
into
bed
the
four
in
blue
dorm
were
left
to
arrange
their
photographs
and
private
belongings
before
changing
into
their
white
frocks
for
supper
joey
got
to
work
on
her
shelf
and
combined
chest
of
drawers
and
silently
and
unsociably
the
others
had
a
great
deal
to
say
to
each
other
and
took
no
notice
of
her
for
some
little
time
then
sybil
who
had
finished
came
strolling
up
to
the
corner
by
the
door
and
cast
a
glance
over
joey
photographs
i
say
what
an
awfully
boy
she
said
picking
up
the
photo
of
gavin
taken
for
mums
out
of
the
tip
uncle
staff
sent
him
when
he
won
the
scholarship
who
he
your
brother
the
devil
entered
into
joey
no
that
the
flesher
boy
in
calgarloch
a
great
pal
of
mine
she
stated
easily
arranging
mums
side
by
side
with
father
in
uniform
syb
stared
joey
went
on
the
kid
in
socks
is
the
youngest
he
called
bingo
and
these
two
ronnie
and
kirsty
belong
to
the
shop
at
crumach
with
which
appalling
size
in
thumpers
joey
turned
her
back
upon
the
girls
and
went
on
arranging
her
photographs
syb
left
her
in
a
hurry
the
others
whispered
together
joey
finished
her
corner
and
got
out
her
evening
frock
having
us
on
asked
noreen
with
a
doubtful
note
of
appreciation
joey
slipped
her
frock
over
her
head
find
out
she
suggested
that
made
a
pause
and
everybody
put
on
their
evening
dresses
in
silence
barbara
broke
it
while
hair
was
being
brushed
i
suppose
gabrielle
told
you
that
this
dorm
tubs
at
night
she
observed
unwillingly
you
had
better
not
be
late
coming
up
because
the
water
gets
cold
so
quickly
but
of
course
you
bath
last
because
of
being
new
syb
joined
in
rather
truculently
joey
made
no
answer
she
was
considering
where
is
the
bathroom
she
asked
right
opposite
blue
dorm
uses
no
barbara
vouchsafed
thank
you
joey
answered
with
extraordinary
meekness
a
meekness
that
was
almost
overdone
these
horrid
swanky
girls
had
forced
her
to
accept
the
worst
corner
of
the
room
but
it
was
certainly
nearest
the
door
and
joey
was
quite
clear
in
her
own
mind
which
of
the
blue
dorm
occupants
was
going
to
have
first
tub
they
went
down
to
supper
after
that
the
three
together
and
joey
behind
there
was
a
very
nice
supper
laid
in
the
huge
refectory
but
joey
was
for
the
little
at
calgarloch
and
the
brandered
herrings
and
the
brown
bread
and
robina
the
lass
bringing
in
the
pudding
and
joining
freely
in
the
conversation
if
she
felt
inclined
joey
sat
between
two
rather
big
girls
and
they
only
spoke
once
to
her
to
ask
her
name
and
age
and
then
talked
hockey
across
her
for
the
rest
of
the
meal
not
that
joey
cared
she
assured
herself
that
she
want
to
be
friends
with
these
girls
there
was
dancing
after
supper
in
the
queen
hall
but
joey
looked
on
dancing
was
taught
at
calgarloch
and
she
refused
decidedly
when
gabrielle
came
and
asked
for
a
valse
and
then
at
nine
there
were
prayers
and
the
whole
of
the
upper
school
with
remove
ii
a
and
b
of
the
lower
filed
past
miss
conyngham
and
said
the
juniors
had
been
swept
off
a
good
deal
earlier
joey
was
really
glad
when
bedtime
came
she
was
longing
to
get
a
bit
of
her
own
back
noreen
and
had
taken
her
in
and
made
an
utter
fool
of
her
over
the
tidying
of
the
lab
and
the
putting
on
of
the
head
girl
boots
but
joey
was
going
to
sit
down
meekly
under
the
treatment
she
managed
to
plant
herself
just
in
front
of
sybil
barbara
and
noreen
in
the
long
procession
and
before
she
went
downstairs
she
had
put
out
her
towel
sponges
where
she
could
snatch
them
easily
the
procession
moved
on
and
she
moved
with
it
she
could
hear
miss
conyngham
clear
mellow
voice
jacynth
mary
doron
oh
what
about
that
tooth
has
it
given
you
more
trouble
block
number
one
joey
heard
syb
grumble
behind
bother
toothache

water
will
be
cold
doron
toothache
was
much
better
thank
you
yes
the
stuff

done
it
a
lot
of
good
she
would
want
any
more
she
thought
thank
you
miss

doron
westerby
moved
on
so
did
the
procession
sylvia
trixie
cecily
kathleen
any
more
news

home
dear
block
number
two
joey
wondered
if
syb
exaggerated
groan
would
be
heard
by
miss
conyngham
they
were
so
near
her
now
yes
kathleen
had
heard
from
home
and
frankie
was
better
his
temperature
had
gone
down
three
degrees
thank
you
miss
conyngham
kathleen
was
disposed
of
thelma
winifred
oh

you
jocelyn
settled
your
things
comfortably
into
the
blue
dormitory
yes
thank
you
miss
conyngham
that
right
sleep
well
jocelyn
the
procession
moved
on
joey
was
out
of
the
queen
hall
and
on
the
stairs
up
them
three
steps
at
a
time
the
long
legs
at
which
calgarloch
stared
amazed
were
certainly
of
use
now
behind
her
she
heard
syb
and
barbara
disputing
whose
turn
it
was
to
have
first
bath
as
the
turn
had
to
be
remembered
across
the
width
of
the
holidays
that
was
a
difficult
matter
to
decide
joey
chuckled
inwardly
they
really
need
worry
themselves
to
remember
she
plunged
at
the
door
of
blue
dorm
and
grabbed
her
things
including
pyjamas
and
too
late
the
other
three
saw
what
she
meant
to
do
here
you
are
last
for
the
bathroom
syb
shouted
joey
dived
across
the
passage
and
flung
herself
and
her
belongings
into
bathroom
i
do
think
she
said
succinctly
as
she
slammed
the
bolt
home
joey
enjoyed
her
bath
she
took
as
much
hot
water
as
she
wanted
and
did
come
out
whatever
the
bangings
and
objurgations
outside
the
door
till
she
had
been
in
the
bath
as
long
as
she
wished
then
at
last
she
emerged
to
face
a
furious
trio
waiting
for
her
in
blue
dorm
joey
plumped
down
her
armful
of
belongings
on
her
bed
i
should
hurry
she
advised
politely
the
tap
was
beginning
to
run
cooler
before
i
left
syb
bolted
to
the
bathroom
the
other
two
turned
their
backs
studiously
upon
the
aggressor
and
talked
ostentatiously
to
one
another
joey
curled
up
on
her
bed
did
her
hair
in
three
bangs
and
then
wrote
up
her
diary
for
the
first
day
at
redlands
redlands
is
a
hole
and
the
girls
are
pigs
i
hate
them
all
except
gabrielle
they
think
it
a
fair
disgrace
to
have
been
at
a
council
school
and
say
beastly
things
i
wish
i
was
seventeen
this
minute
and
coming
away
i
never
get
a
bit
of
paper
big
enough
to
cross
off
all
the
hateful
horrid
days
i
got
to
stay
here
i
have
settled
never
to
say
a
single
word
to
any
of
these
hateful
horrid
swanky
girls
except
gabrielle
as
long
as
i
live
the
letter
to
mums
which
was
also
written
while
the
other
three
bathed
in
tepid
water
with
much
bitterness
of
spirit
expressed
a
rather
different
view
it
frightfully
pretty
here
joey
wrote
and
the
wash
lies
on
the
edge
of
what
you
see
all
glittering
and
the
river
is
mixed
up
with
it
and
the
deeps
are
like
another
sea
only
green
grass
the
college
is
awfully
nice
and
some
of
it
is
very
ancient
and
historical
i
tell
you
the
history
bits
when
i
mugged
them
up
i
in
blue
dorm
and
that
the
nicest
dorm
i
have
the
bed
nearest
the
door
and
that
frightfully
handy
for
getting
first
bath
my
are
sybil
barbara
and
noreen
they
were
very
interested
in
my
photographs
i
going
to
have
a
topping
time
here
i
can
see
and
i
should
think
i
in
the
liveliest
dorm
that
ever
your
loving
joey
you
might
write
soon
i
frightfully
happy
here
still
you
might
write
a
bell
rang
just
as
joey
had
finished
her
letter
and
a
stentorian
voice
in
the
passage
cried
silence
for
prayers
noreen
rushed
from
the
bathroom
after
a
tub
lasting
a
short
two
minutes
and
hurled
herself
upon
her
knees
among
her
sponges
and
a
minute
later
a
prefect
looked
in
and
withdrew
noiselessly
there
was
absolute
quiet
for
some
seven
or
eight
minutes
and
then
a
little
murmur
arose
again
joey
had
dropped
her
and
said
her
prayers
like
the
rest
she
wondered
if
she
ought
to
feel
ashamed
of
her
behaviour
with
the
bath
the
sad
thing
was
that
she
did
particularly
and
if
she
said
she
was
sorry
now
the
furious
three
would
think
she
was
afraid
of
what
they
might
do
to
her
joey
decided
to
stick
it
out
but
have
a
shorter
and
a
cooler
bath
another
bell
rang
noreen
and
syb
were
already
in
bed
barbara
jumped
up
at
the
bell
and
joey
more
slowly
followed
her
example
the
prefect
looked
in
again
all
in
bed
that
right
she
turned
to
put
out
the
light
ingrid
said
the
injured
three
in
a
burst
said
joey
pointedly
by
herself
when
the
others
had
finished
ingrid
latimer
looked
in
her
direction
why
it
the
new
kid
she
came
across
to
joey
bed
got
my
message
young
yes
thanks
awfully
that
all
right
he
wo
think
any
more
of
it
you
come
to
me
if
anybody
tries
on
that
sort
of
game
again
you
always
find
some
idiots
in
coll
who
think
it
funny
and
thanks
no
end
ingrid
turned
the
light
out
blue
dorm
was
left
in
outward
peace
it
was
outward
only
chapter
vi
a
night
on
the
leads
ingrid
steps
alert
responsible
died
away
into
distance
silence
settled
down
then
sybil
drew
a
long
breath
and
spoke
in
accents
which
were
hushed
but
audible
of
all
the
utterly
mean
young
skunks
disgusting
noreen
agreed
but
i
suppose
she
has
learnt
anything
better
said
barbara
joey
wriggled
in
bed
but
held
her
tongue
let
them
go
on
they
would
hurt
her
such
a
pig
about
the
i
hardly
washed
at
all
syb
went
on
frightfully
lowering
to
redlands
to
turn
that
sort
in
barbara
took
up
the
parable
joey
could
keep
out
of
the
fray
any
longer
did
the
redlands
girls
want
to
have
a
nice
kind
fat
old
nurse
apiece
to
look
after
them
and
keep
them
from
being
contaminated
by
less
select
people
she
jeered
poor
little
dears
we
not
talking
to
you
jocelyn
graham
we
do
talk
to
girls
who
behave
as
you
do
sybil
told
her
icily
righto
do
then
joey
said
and
turned
over
in
bed
but
the
outraged
three
had
not
finished
by
any
manner
of
means
sucking
up
and
sneaking
to
ingrid
latimer
too
i
do
call
that
the
limit
noreen
went
on
notice
how
she
jawed
us
and
i
adored
ingrid
all
last
term
joey
was
too
proud
to
speak
again
after
her
recent
snub
or
she
might
have
informed
them
that
she
had
sneaked
to
ingrid
latimer
as
it
was
let
them
think
it
if
they
liked
she
did
care
shame
to
put
her
into
blue
dorm
that
was
barbara
she
could
be
cleared
out
miss
conyngham
is
frightfully
stuffy
about
changing
dorms
after
she
and
matron
have
worked
it
all
out
joey
got
out
of
bed
shouldered
into
a
thrust
on
slippers
and
seized
her
blue
quilt
as
it
rather
difficult
to
go
to
sleep
while
you
making
all
this
row
i
sleep
somewhere
else
if
you
do
mind
she
explained
with
elaborate
politeness
and
was
out
of
the
door
trailing
her
quilt
after
her
before
any
of
the
three
had
recovered
from
the
blank
surprise
caused
by
her
remark
when
she
came
out
of
bathroom
joey
had
noticed
a
ladder
at
the
far
end
of
the
passage
she
guessed
that
it
must
lead
on
to
the
roof
and
what
better
place
could
one
find
to
sleep
on
than
a
roof
on
such
a
fine
september
night
as
this
even
if
it
rained
she
thought
the
leads
would
be
better
than
a
blue
dorm
full
of
hateful
girls
who
talked
at
her
she
scrambled
up
the
latter
stumbling
over
the
blue
quilt
pushed
open
a
and
arrived
sure
enough
upon
the
leads
all
silver
in
the
moonlight
she
had
been
boiling
over
with
fury
when
she
escaped
from
the
blue
dorm
but
this
wonderful
silver
world
had
a
calming
effect
it
was
far
clearer
now
than
it
had
been
when
she
came
then
a
haze
had
hovered
over
the
horizon
now
the
broad
line
of
the
fossdyke
wash
glittered
a
silver
glory
on
the
edge
of
the
white
world
the
great
stretch
of
the
walpole
fen
intersected
by
its
wide
ditches
unrolled
itself
before
her
and
in
the
flatness
that
curious
round
tower
stood
out
conspicuously
joey
looked
at
it
with
interest
it
curious
to
see
a
tower
standing
all
by
itself
like
that
she
wondered
whether
she
would
be
allowed
to
go
and
explore
it
sometime
by
herself
of
course
without
the
company
of
any
of
those
hateful
redlands
girls
and
then
she
thought
how
interested
mums
would
be
in
hearing
of
it
and
then
she
thought
how
much
more
interested
mums
would
be
if
she
joey
had
seen
the
redoubtable
blue
light
which
gabrielle
had
mentioned
and
then
she
wondered
if
she
would
see
it
where
she
would
have
an
even
better
view
than
if
she
had
been
allowed
a
window
bed
that
was
the
last
clear
thought
in
her
mind
before
she
found
a
sheltered
corner
rolled
herself
tightly
in
her
quilt
and
fell
asleep
with
her
face
buried
in
the
hollow
of
her
arm
to
get
away
from
the
moonlight
she
dreamt
of
the
tower
of
course
but
all
her
dreams
were
confused
not
clear
she
awoke
at
last
to
a
sense
of
cold
which
had
been
with
her
for
some
time
before
it
roused
her
you
little
pig
kirsty
you
taken
all
the
clothes
she
murmured
sleepily
and
then
as
consciousness
came
back
she
knew
that
she
was
in
the
familiar
little
bed
at
pilot
cottage
where
there
was
just
room
for
kirsty
and
herself
and
no
more
but
somewhere
in
a
dark
outdoor
world
with
no
moon
left
and
a
fine
rain
falling
joey
stood
up
holding
her
damp
quilt
about
her
luckily
her
was
thick
but
even
with
that
she
shivered
of
course
she
must
go
inside
to
blue
dorm
which
seemed
decidedly
attractive
at
that
moment
only
how
in
the
world
was
she
to
find
the
in
the
dark
joey
turned
round
trying
to
make
out
the
geography
of
the
roof
and
as
she
turned
something
blue
shone
for
a
moment
through
the
drizzly
darkness
she
watched
the
light
forgetting
damp
and
discomfort
and
the
rather
forlorn
feeling
which
had
seized
her
the
blue
light
flashed
out
three
times
and
then
disappeared
almost
at
once
the
stable
clock
struck
two
the
blue
light
had
done
more
than
give
joey
a
thrilling
story
for
mums
it
had
shown
her
how
she
stood
when
she
came
up
through
the
the
tower
had
been
on
her
right
she
made
straight
for
the
in
the
darkness
and
landed
full
upon
it
she
felt
the
ring
through
her
bedroom
slippers
she
knelt
down
and
lifted
it
cautiously
crept
through
and
went
down
the
ladder
backwards
much
impeded
by
the
quilt
and
with
all
her
teeth
chattering
as
if
they
would
never
stop
noiselessly
she
tiptoed
into
blue
dorm
found
her
bed
and
got
into
it
pulling
her
bedclothes
tightly
round
her
unfortunately
this
process
did
not
keep
her
teeth
from
chattering
cold
chills
chased
each
other
up
and
down
her
spine
and
the
bed
shook
with
her
shivering
someone
spoke
from
one
of
the
window
beds
i
say
jocelyn
thought
you
were
talking
to
me
joey
inquired
as
as
is
possible
with
teeth
chattering
like
castanets
it
was
noreen
voice
that
had
spoken
she
recognized
the
faint
touch
of
the
brogue
are
you
crying
likely
joey
got
all
the
scorn
possible
into
that
one
word
noreen
sat
up
in
bed
then
what
you
doing
shivering
oh
said
noreen
and
ducked
down
in
her
bed
because
there
was
a
step
outside
and
the
door
opened
ingrid
came
in
with
a
candle
i
thought
i
heard
talking
is
any
one
ill
joey
withdrew
herself
and
her
shivers
well
under
the
bedclothes
and
buried
her
face
in
the
pillow
nothing
the
matter
ingrid
noreen
said
rather
flustered
i
just
thought
one
of
them
was
awake
and
asked
ingrid
was
in
a
hurry
and
rather
cold
besides
she
did
not
make
a
tour
of
the
beds
in
blue
dorm
my
dear
kid
do
wake
people
up
to
ask
if
they
awake
she
said
you
spoke
quite
loud
i
heard
you
in
the
passage
when
i
was
fetching
stuff
for
dorothy
earache
go
to
sleep
and
anyhow
keep
quiet
please
she
shut
the
door
noreen
wisely
waited
for
a
good
five
minutes
before
saying
anything
else
then
she
got
out
of
bed
and
came
across
to
joey
carrying
her
quilt
stick
this
on
top
of
yours
goodness
you
cold
like
my
rug
too
it
just
folded
at
the
end
of
my
bed
i
can
get
it
in
a
sec
thanks
awfully
jerked
poor
joey
wondering
if
she
ever
would
be
warm
again
though
she
did
want
to
take
anything
from
these
horrid
unfriendly
redlands
girls
she
could
resist
the
quilt
and
the
rug
and
noreen
voice
was
kind
just
then
where
you
been
noreen
whispered
as
she
tucked
the
plaid
down
over
the
two
quilts
roof
said
joey
you
have
up
the
ladder
and
on
to
the
leads
you
slept
there
i
say
there
have
been
a
row
if
ingrid
found
out
well
i
suppose
so
joey
acknowledged
her
teeth
were
chattering
rather
less
it
was
more
possible
to
speak
she
be
sure
to
say
we
drove
you
to
it
noreen
said
she
knew
about
our
ragging
you
i
did
tell
her
at
least
when
i
asked
about
her
boots
i
spoke
about
the
lab
and
she
wanted
to
know
who
told
me
to
tidy
it
joey
explained
did
you
tell
no
noreen
sat
down
on
her
bed
you
rather
a
young
sport
jocelyn
i
say
it
was
rather
a
shame
about
the
lab
was
the
professor
a
frightful
beast
about
it
he
was
rather
i
think
he
need
have
been
so
bad
considering
the
french
and
we
are
allies
for
evermore
joey
said
he
only
daresay
he
ca
be
as
nice
as
pure
french
noreen
suggested
soothingly
anyhow
ingrid
has
settled
him
up
she
can
tackle
any
professor
born
you
should
see
her
with
our
literature
prof
disagrees
with
him
and
that
sort
of
thing
all
the
same
it
was
a
mean
shame
to
have
you
on
about
the
lab
jocelyn
i
was
really
rather
sorry
about
it
afterwards
only
you
know
you
were
so
uppish
about
the
bath
the
shivers
had
practically
subsided
joey
felt
happier
i
know
i
should
do
that
again
i
do
blame
you
for
getting
something
off
us
when
you
had
the
chance
noreen
observed
with
an
effort
after
fair
play
jocelyn
i
hope
you
be
all
right
now
noreen
thanks
ever
so
joey
went
to
sleep
at
last
with
an
idea
in
her
mind
that
some
at
least
of
the
girls
at
redlands
were
better
than
they
seemed
no
one
could
think
how
a
girl
who
had
arrived
perfectly
well
at
four
yesterday
could
manage
to
develop
such
a
frightful
crying
cold
as
joey
brought
to
breakfast
next
morning
miss
lambton
commented
upon
it
her
neighbors
at
breakfast
commented
upon
it
with
less
concern
and
more
candour
matron
commented
upon
it
quite
severely
while
sticking
a
thermometer
that
tasted
of
carbolic
into
joey
unwilling
mouth
in
the
hall
noreen
was
hovering
near
please
i
expect
that
bed
by
the
door
has
a
draught
or
something
she
suggested
shall
i
change
with
her
i
do
mind
really
rubbish
about
a
draught
matron
answered
briskly
there
is
just
as
much
draught
by
a
window
but
you
can
change
beds
if
you
both
like
only
it
not
to
be
a
precedent
matron
urbanity
was
possibly
due
to
the
fact
that
joey
had
been
proved
to
have
no
temperature
and
therefore
could
not
be
convicted
of
the
heinous
crime
of
sickening
for
measles
flu
or
keep
a
on
all
day
in
the
house
and
you
are
not
to
stand
about
when
the
ground
is
wet
or
stay
out
after
four
she
said
with
authority
you
can
run
away
now
but
be
careful
you
must
have
done
something
really
silly
to
get
a
cold
like
that
come
and
change
the
beds
whispered
noreen
and
the
two
ran
up
to
blue
dorm
together
look
here
it
jolly
decent
of
you
but
it
does
matter
about
changing
really
joey
blurted
out
noreen
grinned
engagingly
you
silly
cuckoo
do
you
see
i
want
to
bag
your
tip
of
bath
but
joey
knew
that
was
the
real
reason
she
began
to
like
noreen
chapter
vii
the
violet
handkerchief
a
select
committee
consisting
of
ingrid
latimer
freda
martin
joan
chichester
and
miss
lambton
the
assistant
tried
the
new
girls
for
hockey
that
afternoon
playing
them
with
a
selection
from
the
second
joey
enjoyed
herself
though
she
had
not
played
since
she
was
quite
small
and
a
at
a
school
in
hertfordshire
her
running
and
her
passing
were
both
commended
the
one
by
ingrid
and
the
other
by
miss
lambton
and
she
was
dreadfully
disappointed
when
at
four
miss
lambton
looked
at
her
watch
and
said
something
in
an
undertone
to
ingrid
then
she
called
out
jocelyn
graham
is
to
go
indoors
now
change
your
hockey
things
jocelyn
she
added
and
you
can
ask
for
a
book
from
the
lower
school
library
of
course
that
bothering
cold
joey
thanked
miss
lambton
and
went
indoors
in
very
low
spirits
now
that
she
had
been
reminded
of
her
cold
she
felt
much
worse
at
once
her
head
and
eyes
were
heavy
she
did
think
she
would
ask
for
a
book
after
all
she
wandered
up
to
blue
dorm
and
began
to
change
very
slowly
finally
taking
out
a
clean
handkerchief
from
the
drawer
and
putting
her
handkerchief
her
third
that
day
into
her
something
showed
at
the
bottom
of
her
bag
under
the
white
of
her
own
handkerchiefs
of
course
she
still
had
the
violet
silk
handkerchief
which
she
had
used
to
dust
the
lab
joey
decided
that
it
would
be
a
very
good
thing
to
wash
it
here
and
now
while
she
had
the
time
she
plunged
her
arm
into
the
and
drew
it
out
what
a
good
thing
she
had
needed
another
handkerchief
or
it
would
probably
have
gone
to
the
wash
with
her
other
things
and
the
professor
would
have
had
to
wait
till
the
laundry
returned
it
joey
dashed
into
the
bathroom
with
the
violet
handkerchief
turned
on
some
moderately
hot
water
and
began
to
scrub
with
vigour
she
got
the
dirt
off
fairly
well
to
judge
by
the
extraordinarily
black
condition
of
the
bath
if
she
could
only
dry
it
it
might
be
possible
to
return
it
to
the
lab
this
very
evening
joey
did
like
to
think
of
the
professor
wanting
his
handkerchief
and
thinking
of
her
as
a
thief
as
well
as
a
most
interfering
schoolgirl
but
how
was
she
to
dry
that
handkerchief
hung
out
over
a
chair
in
the
blue
dorm
it
would
certainly
take
all
night
the
late
september
sun
was
near
its
setting
she
could
dry
it
on
the
window
ledge
that
was
quite
certain
if
only
gabrielle
had
been
about
or
even
noreen
she
might
perhaps
have
asked
whether
it
was
allowable
to
go
down
to
the
kitchens
to
find
a
fire
already
in
the
hours
she
had
spent
at
redlands
she
had
learnt
there
were
several
things
not
allowed
which
would
have
been
the
ordinary
sort
of
thing
to
do
at
calgarloch
and
father
had
always
been
particular
about
obedience
but
both
were
playing
hockey
and
joey
was
still
cautious
about
the
others
probably
she
would
be
had
on
again
if
she
asked
strangers
she
went
down
two
flights
of
stairs
holding
the
wet
handkerchief
crumpled
in
her
hand
and
wondering
what
she
had
better
do
then
she
saw
a
door
open
and
heard
a
babel
of
small
voices
coming
from
behind
it
and
surprising
sight
a
glow
of
firelight
she
pushed
the
door
open
a
very
little
farther
and
peeped
in
about
twelve
or
fourteen
very
small
girls
their
ages
ranging
from
six
or
seven
to
nine
were
sitting
in
a
huge
round
a
bright
fire
they
were
all
talking
hard
regardless
of
a
maid
who
was
laying
tea
a
very
nice
tea
with
plenty
of
bread
and
jam
and
a
plate
of
round
buns
they
all
stopped
chattering
though
when
they
caught
sight
of
joey
and
stared
at
her
solemnly
in
absolute
silence
still
she
could
be
uncomfortable
with
people
of
that
age
even
if
they
had
reminded
her
so
much
of
kirsty
and
bingo
do
you
mind
if
i
come
in
and
dry
something
by
your
fire
she
asked
the
children
received
the
request
most
graciously
scrambling
aside
to
make
room
for
her
in
the
middle
of
the
circle
and
helping
her
to
hang
the
handkerchief
over
the
high
nursery
fender
is
it
your
hankserchiff
asked
a
small
solemn
voice
while
she
was
spreading
it
out
and
she
turned
round
to
meet
the
grave
dark
eyes
of
the
very
tiniest
child
she
had
ever
seen
at
school
she
was
about
half
bingo
size
but
she
spoke
quite
distinctly
except
for
the
mispronunciation
of
the
word
handkerchief
her
black
hair
was
cut
square
over
her
forehead
and
bobbed
her
small
round
face
had
very
little
colour
and
except
for
the
amount
of
expression
in
it
and
the
fact
that
she
was
talking
joey
could
almost
have
taken
her
for
a
french
doll
no
it
not
mine
it
one
i
borrowed
so
i
washed
it
she
explained
and
then
she
pulled
the
tiny
child
upon
her
lap
as
she
sat
on
the
floor
what
your
name
i
wonder
bertillia
breathed
the
mite
pronouncing
all
the
syllables
quite
distinctly
and
looking
solemnly
up
at
joey
as
she
spoke
but
we
call
her
tiddles
said
a
person
on
joey
right
at
least
the
big
ones
did
first
and
we
caught
it
off
them
and
she
like
a
tiddles
is
she
just
a
sort
of
little
kitten
thing
you
can
pick
up
you
squeeze
me
when
you
pick
me
up
tiddles
stated
how
old
is
she
joey
asked
cuddling
tiddles
close
as
she
cuddled
bingo
when
he
allowed
it
which
was
often
oh
she
six
but
is
she
small
people
think
she
only
two
or
three
rosie
answered
she
belgian
you
know
and
miss
conyngham
has
taken
her
she
got
nobody
her
mother
got
killed
and
the
one
who
brought
her
to
england
died
of
tiredness
poor
thing
she
had
to
walk
and
walk
and
carry
tiddles
she
found
her
you
know
and
look
what
those
pigly
germans
had
done
to
her
show
your
arm
tiddles
darling
tiddles
who
had
listened
seriously
and
unwinkingly
to
her
mournful
story
related
so
very
cheerfully
by
rosie
gave
a
funny
little
nod
and
pulled
up
the
loose
sleeve
of
her
tiny
blouse
on
the
small
arm
was
a
long
deep
scar
did
the
huns
joey
gasped
yes
though
she
was
just
a
tiny
baby
we
never
going
to
speak
to
a
german
again
as
long
as
we
live
rosie
stated
firmly
we
settled
that
we
shall
just
look
the
other
way
if
we
meet
one
as
though
he
was
a
bad
smell
poor
tiddles
tiddles
had
been
staring
at
joey
very
solemnly
all
the
time
that
joey
was
looking
at
her
arm
now
she
suddenly
laid
down
her
black
head
upon
joey
shoulder
i
like
you
she
said
joey
kissed
the
top
of
the
little
black
head
you
a
darling
my
father
was
killed
by
the
germans
at
least
by
their
being
such
beasts
to
him
and
all
the
other
wounded
men
they
put
him
in
a
and
it
was
all
filth
and
they
had
no
water
and
when
the
women
on
the
way
heard
they
were
english
they
would
give
them
any
though
they
had
heaps
joey
stared
through
the
bars
of
the
grate
her
eyes
growing
dim
so
father
died
after
a
bit
would
you
ever
do
anything
for
a
german
except
despise
him
another
small
girl
asked
truculently
and
joey
answered
no
i
do
suppose
i
should
she
scrambled
up
in
a
hurry
oh
my
hanky
singeing
she
was
only
just
in
time
to
save
it
for
the
fire
was
really
very
hot
she
snatched
it
from
the
fender
and
looked
it
over
anxiously
to
see
if
there
were
any
scorched
places
no
there
were
none
but
something
rather
strange
caught
her
eyes
in
one
corner
something
that
came
between
the
neat
red
lettering
of
the
professor
name
some
tiny
marks
that
stood
out
oddly
in
bright
yellow
from
the
dark
violet
background
joey
stared
at
them
for
a
moment
in
silence
holding
the
handkerchief
stretched
to
its
widest
in
her
two
hands
they
were
photographed
upon
her
mind
in
that
moment
before
they
faded
and
disappeared
leaving
the
red
lettering
of
the
professor
name
alone
and
the
handkerchief
curious
marks
they
were
too
marks
that
looked
like
little
dots
and
dashes
joey
wondered
for
a
second
and
then
she
heard
noreen
calling
in
the
passage
jocelyn
jocelyn
joey
made
a
dash
for
the
door
pursued
by
a
chorus
of
come
again
come
again
soon
in
her
hurry
she
thought
no
more
about
the
oddness
of
the
little
marks
which
appeared
with
the
heat
and
disappeared
again
as
quickly
noreen
sounded
perhaps
she
would
return
the
handkerchief
to
the
professor
as
joey
herself
was
forbidden
to
go
out
she
preferred
her
request
breathlessly
noreen
very
muddy
and
dishevelled
answered
a
shade
doubtfully
he
always
such
a
sort
of
beast
if
you
intrude
on
his
blessed
privacy
still
i
do
mind
trying
if
you
like
he
to
be
pleased
to
get
back
his
old
hanky
what
am
i
to
say
if
i
see
him
humblest
apologies
and
all
that
righto
stay
with
the
kids
till
tea
we
sha
get
a
fire
till
if
i
do
return
look
for
me
in
a
poisoned
grave
under
the
lab
noreen
departed
joey
went
back
to
the
babies
for
the
ten
minutes
that
remained
before
and
found
that
they
liked
stories
quite
as
much
as
kirsty
and
bingo
did
then
matron
came
in
to
give
them
their
tea
and
joey
went
down
to
hers
she
did
not
see
noreen
till
the
meal
was
over
but
caught
her
up
in
the
hall
on
the
way
to
the
classrooms
for
prep
so
sorry
jocelyn
after
you
washed
it
and
all
but
i
let
that
hanky
drop
on
the
way
and
muddied
it
a
little
not
much
so
i
thought
i
better
not
face
the
professor
but
just
chucked
it
in
at
an
open
window
you
bet
he
see
it
he
probably
wo
know
it
ever
left
the
floor
where
you
found
it
she
said
so
that
all
right
is
it
thanks
awfully
joe
said
and
tried
to
think
it
was
as
right
as
noreen
said
chapter
viii
the
matron
was
lying
in
wait
at
the
door
of
remove
ii
b
classroom
and
pounced
on
joey
as
she
came
out
at
the
end
of
prep
explaining
that
she
was
to
go
to
bed
at
once
in
order
that
her
throat
and
chest
might
be
rubbed
with
camphorated
oil
joey
submitted
but
unwillingly
bed
two
hours
before
anybody
else
when
she
did
feel
ill
only
heavy
was
a
very
depressing
idea
however
it
was
clearly
no
case
for
argument
matron
bustled
her
through
her
bath
and
into
bed
and
was
rubbing
her
with
a
vigour
that
left
no
breath
for
conversation
on
her
part
by
the
time
the
other
three
came
in
to
change
their
frocks
for
supper
joey
wished
very
heartily
that
matron
had
finished
for
she
had
thought
of
some
new
and
effective
things
to
say
to
syb
and
barbara
in
answer
to
their
taunts
of
last
night
noreen
was
of
course
to
be
left
out
noreen
had
really
been
decent
about
the
bed
and
everything
even
if
she
had
been
the
ringleader
in
that
ragging
business
joey
meant
to
forgive
and
forget
where
noreen
was
concerned
but
to
let
syb
and
barbara
have
it
hot
and
strong
only
she
would
contrive
to
let
them
know
that
she
would
take
all
the
hot
water
again
but
of
course
nothing
could
be
said
or
done
while
matron
was
in
the
room
she
had
finished
the
rubbing
now
but
was
pouring
out
a
portentous
dose
of
ammoniated
quinine
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
barbara
syb
and
noreen
were
dressing
with
extraordinary
politeness
please
barbara
could
you
hook
me
up
and
so
on
they
were
nearly
ready
if
matron
stayed
much
longer
the
supper
bell
would
ring
and
the
opportunity
would
be
lost
joey
gulped
the
ammoniated
quinine
with
a
haste
that
brought
tears
to
her
eyes
but
still
matron
did
not
go
she
was
inspecting
garments
with
a
searching
eye
to
see
that
she
was
wearing
enough
of
them
noreen
barbara
and
syb
had
reached
the
stage
before
matron
had
finished
pointing
out
the
need
of
another
vest
and
she
was
still
mentioning
kindly
but
firmly
that
it
was
generally
a
girl
own
fault
if
she
caught
a
cold
when
the
bell
rang
and
it
was
too
late
joey
could
almost
have
cried
a
maid
brought
her
a
strictly
invalid
supper
a
cup
of
bread
and
milk
and
a
spongecake
rather
unexciting
joey
made
it
last
as
long
as
possible
but
that
was
very
long
then
there
was
nothing
left
to
do
but
wait
till
the
rest
came
to
bed
the
advantage
of
having
a
window
bed
was
not
specially
apparent
just
now
because
there
was
no
moon
and
the
was
quite
dark
not
even
the
shadowy
outline
of
the
high
round
tower
was
to
be
seen
joey
lay
mournfully
in
bed
and
wished
for
a
book
if
the
girls
danced
again
after
supper
it
would
be
quite
nine
before
they
came
upstairs
and
it
had
struck
eight
yet
more
than
a
whole
long
hour
to
wait
doing
nothing
and
then
just
as
she
was
thinking
that
the
door
of
blue
dorm
opened
and
gabrielle
put
her
head
in
joey
could
see
her
auburn
hair
against
the
light
in
the
passage
the
room
itself
was
dark
the
maid
having
turned
off
the
electric
light
when
she
took
the
supper
tray
are
you
sleepy
jocelyn
or
would
you
like
me
to
come
in
and
talk
she
asked
oh
do
come
in
i
fearfully
tired
of
bed
joey
burst
out
that
is
if
you
do
want
to
be
dancing
gabrielle
shut
the
door
and
felt
her
way
over
to
the
one
occupied
bed
i
rather
talk
somebody
rushed
at
the
door
turned
the
handle
violently
and
dashed
in
hullo
jocelyn
ready
for
some
company
demanded
a
cheerful
and
familiar
voice
gabrielle
switched
on
the
light
and
she
and
noreen
looked
at
one
another
oh
you
come
to
sit
with
jocelyn
have
you
noreen
said
then
better
clear
out
look
here
why
should
we
both
stay
suggested
gabrielle
do
know
why
we
should
noreen
agreed
mind
jocelyn
rather
not
only
there
one
thing
i
want
to
say
to
you
which
gabrielle
hear
it
is
my
secret
noreen
explained
hurriedly
shall
i
get
out
gabrielle
asked
no
stick
your
fingers
in
your
ears
a
sec
if
you
do
mind
gabrielle
obliged
noreen
plumped
down
on
joey
bed
it
this
syb
and
barbara
asked
me
to
tell
you
they
sorry
they
were
such
beasts
to
you
last
night
and
they
think
you
a
sport
not
to
have
let
on
to
ingrid
did
they
say
that
gasped
joey
yes
honest
injun
then
i
sha
be
able
to
say
the
utterly
hateful
things
i
thought
of
for
joey
murmured
regretfully
but
i
a
pig
about
the
was
i
you
were
noreen
agreed
with
fervour
then
that
all
right
and
square
please
tell
them
i
sorry
i
took
it
all
have
you
finished
asked
gabrielle
tragically
it
giving
me
a
pain
in
both
my
arms
to
keep
them
up
so
long
noreen
pulled
her
arms
down
it
all
right
we
only
been
settling
to
be
friends
in
this
dorm
after
all
it
a
decent
dorm
it
was
a
pity
to
fight
in
it
it
got
the
best
places
for
photos
of
any
gabrielle
said
walking
round
and
looking
at
joey
collection
in
a
very
friendly
way
may
i
take
them
down
and
look
i
say
what
a
darling
little
thing
in
socks
is
he
your
brother
yes
he
bingo
his
proper
name
is
bevil
but
of
course
we
call
him
a
thing
like
that
poor
kid
joey
explained
quite
cheerfully
he
is
pretty
is
he
an
artist
came
along
and
painted
him
last
year
and
he
was
in
the
academy
he
did
him
hugging
a
german
helmet
father
brought
back
and
just
in
his
everyday
things
so
bingo
was
pleased
he
was
looking
up
as
if
someone
out
of
the
picture
was
telling
him
something
he
was
going
to
lose
a
word
of
the
artist
put
some
latin
under
the
picture
it
meant
fathers
have
told
us
noreen
had
been
staring
all
through
the
narrative
illustration
have
you
finished
asked
gabrielle
but
but
you
that
the
kid
was
the
gravedigger
youngest
she
broke
out
so
i
did
joey
agreed
calmly
and
he
is
did
you
suppose
all
the
having
on
was
going
to
be
upon
one
side
joey
inquired
succinctly
besides
i
thought
you
all
like
it
better
that
way
then
is
the
big
one
the
butcher
boy
no
he
my
brother
gavin
noreen
became
rather
red
i
say
did
you
happen
to
hear
what
we
said
in
the
train
she
stammered
about
the
village
school
and
letting
down
redlands
by
my
coming
joey
answered
yes
i
did
i
could
help
it
you
did
talk
so
fearfully
loud
she
added
we
did
mean
you
to
hear
noreen
said
miserably
joey
grinned
it
does
matter
if
i
did
do
care
it
was
a
very
jolly
village
school
i
sure
it
must
have
been
noreen
said
heartily
look
here
interrupted
gabrielle
what
on
earth
does
it
matter
what
sort
of
school
jocelyn
went
to
it
was
pretty
poor
in
redlanders
even
to
talk
as
if
it
mattered
it
was
owned
noreen
with
a
meekness
that
surprised
joey
considering
that
she
was
quite
half
a
head
taller
than
gabrielle
but
noreen
started
being
awfully
decent
to
me
last
night
when
she
still
thought
all
my
photos
were
what
i
said
they
were
joey
chimed
in
in
a
hurry
so
do
mind
we
went
to
the
village
school
because
father
died
in
the
war
you
know
and
mums
is
frightfully
poor
and
if
the
other
redlanders
do
like
it
well
they
need
but
glad
to
be
friends
with
blue
dorm
at
least
not
enemies
you
know
that
sort
of
friends
i
want
you
to
be
real
friends
jocelyn
the
proper
kind
if
be
it
with
me
as
well
as
gabrielle
noreen
explained
in
a
hurry
i
wanted
to
last
night
all
right
said
joey
i
think
i
like
to
be
friends
too
and
we
must
find
a
name
for
you
suggested
gabrielle
jocelyn
is
awfully
nice
but
the
others
will
think
about
you
as
the
scholarship
kid
they
ragged
if
you
stick
to
it
you
want
some
handy
little
name
that
will
make
you
seem
like
another
girl
and
we
all
start
fresh
they
call
me
at
home
joey
answered
after
a
consideration
she
knew
there
was
a
great
deal
in
what
gabrielle
said
about
the
name
jocelyn
graham
had
not
made
a
very
popular
start
noreen
cried
you
much
more
like
a
boy
than
a
girl
that
suits
you
down
to
the
ground
and
as
she
was
presented
to
the
rather
embarrassed
syb
and
barbara
when
they
came
up
to
bed
armed
with
a
sticky
bag
of
toffee
in
large
lumps
of
which
luxury
the
occupants
of
blue
dorm
smoked
the
forthwith
chapter
ix
maddy
remove
ii
b
had
french
for
first
lesson
next
morning
joey
was
informed
of
the
fact
during
next
morning
by
an
almost
aggressively
friendly
sybil
barbara
and
noreen
who
takes
us
joey
asked
a
little
nervously
french
was
by
no
means
her
strong
point
maddy
of
course
mademoiselle
de
lavernais
what
she
like
noreen
screwed
up
her
face
awfully
old
and
dried
up
and
a
sort
of
front
thing
on
her
head
in
tight
curls
ca
think
why
miss
conyngham
does
have
somebody
younger
syb
chimed
in
no
one
else
is
really
old
at
the
coll
i
bet
maddy
sixty
if
she
a
day
more
barbara
suggested
look
at
her
wrinkles
she
ought
to
be
pensioned
off
or
something
i
should
think
she
jolly
well
deserves
it
she
been
here
more
than
twenty
years
someone
told
me
is
she
nice
asked
joey
thinking
anxiously
of
irregular
verbs
and
elusive
idioms
nice
you
wait
till
you
go
a
howler
in
form
having
me
on
demanded
joey
with
instant
suspicion
no
you
stupid
ca
you
see
when
we
talking
sense
noreen
said
i
ought
to
know
i
always
in
her
black
books
she
simply
ca
bear
me
says
noreen
does
think
or
something
syb
contributed
as
if
anyone
could
be
bothered
to
think
right
through
a
stuffy
french
conversation
class
shrieked
joey
it
is
french
conversation
is
it
is
it
just
maddy
says
heaps
of
girls
can
write
french
decently
but
hardly
anyone
can
speak
it
so
every
wednesday
morning
remove
ii
b
has
the
treat
i
do
think
of
conversing
with
her
in
french
and
you
may
just
say
or
something
like
that
and
then
dry
up
you
got
to
converse
and
she
goes
on
till
she
drags
it
out
of
you
does
everyone
asked
joey
palpitating
she
picks
the
girls
pretty
sure
to
go
for
you
as
you
new
want
to
know
what
your
french
is
like
she
wo
take
long
to
find
out
that
it
utterly
hopeless
joey
remarked
hunting
for
her
shoes
which
had
gone
under
the
bed
i
say
would
it
be
rather
a
rag
to
put
jocelyn
joey
i
mean
up
to
some
perfectly
awful
french
that
would
take
half
the
lesson
to
correct
suggested
noreen
of
the
fertile
brain
then
get
a
rest
brainy
plan
approved
barbara
but
would
you
mind
joey
you
get
into
a
row
you
see
because
she
ca
know
if
you
really
know
any
french
or
not
she
only
just
point
out
to
you
where
you
wrong
in
the
kind
of
tone
which
implies
that
they
would
keep
idiots
of
your
kind
in
france
at
any
price
and
you
have
to
say
or
is
it
i
never
can
remember
which
and
or
is
it
one
get
out
in
the
hols
at
proper
intervals
and
look
intelligent
never
mind
if
it
a
bit
of
a
strain
noreen
contributed
and
joey
having
a
shoe
all
ready
in
her
hand
not
unnaturally
hurled
it
at
the
speaker
noreen
dodged
and
it
got
the
window
and
made
a
huge
star
my
sunday
hat
and
dublin
castle
noreen
exclaimed
craning
round
from
her
seat
on
the
bed
to
examine
the
mischief
you
gone
and
done
it
now
joey
at
least
it
was
most
my
fault
really
i
tell
matron
that
rot
i
threw
the
shoe
joey
said
rather
dismayed
i
do
mind
about
matron
she
ca
do
much
worse
than
the
ghastly
stuff
she
been
giving
me
at
least
i
hope
she
does
stop
the
beastly
window
out
of
my
no
they
do
do
that
sort
of
thing
here
noreen
said
they
just
hold
forth
and
tell
you
carelessness
is
a
sort
of
dishonesty
and
that
sort
of
thing
you
have
to
say
you
sorry
well
i
am
and
matron
will
point
out
you
behaved
like
a
kindergarten
kid
and
if
she
were
tiddles
she
would
be
surprised
at
your
wanting
to
throw
your
shoes
about
comprenny
righto
i
shall
stick
it
joey
assured
her
they
do
nag
here
much
added
the
experienced
noreen
for
her
comfort
when
you
been
jawed
or
punished
or
both
it
over
and
done
with
what
about
the
french
think
you
could
do
anything
i
might
try
joey
said
with
caution
but
there
wo
be
time
now
to
put
her
up
to
it
all
objected
barbara
why
did
we
think
of
it
earlier
why
not
let
joey
as
she
new
try
it
on
some
other
way
put
in
noreen
ask
maddy
something
that
means
a
long
screed
in
answer
oh
yes
i
know
she
squashed
me
flat
for
doing
it
but
that
was
ages
back
and
she
knew
me
and
my
reputation
now
here
a
nice
innocent
and
probably
good
new
girl
do
call
me
names
interrupted
joey
i
said
well
try
and
turn
maddy
on
in
all
innocence
and
ignorance
my
child
and
the
form
will
love
you
for
evermore
we
are
always
absolutely
stuck
for
subjects
the
first
french
day
of
term
the
rang
insistently
what
would
she
to
talk
about
do
you
think
asked
joey
desperately
catching
at
noreen
sleeve
the
war
try
the
affair
she
was
probably
a
blushing
thing
in
a
crinoline
about
that
time
she
enjoy
telling
us
about
it
if
we
can
only
get
her
started
i
try
joey
said
valiantly
and
breathlessly
upon
the
stairs
and
she
worried
out
the
french
for
her
request
during
breakfast
maddy
met
remove
ii
b
at
nine
precisely
joey
watched
her
mount
the
daïs
with
a
sinking
heart
she
was
a
little
lady
who
made
no
pretence
of
being
anything
but
elderly
with
a
skin
that
pouched
under
her
black
eyes
and
the
rather
dusty
front
upon
which
the
girls
had
commented
did
not
match
the
hair
at
the
back
of
her
small
head
she
was
shabbily
dressed
and
all
the
little
air
of
distinction
with
which
she
wore
her
clothes
could
not
make
them
becoming
joey
decided
that
she
should
not
like
mademoiselle
de
lavernais
mademoiselle
wasted
no
time
in
preliminaries
she
said
to
her
class
in
clear
ringing
accents
and
they
responded
very
properly
then
the
real
business
began
in
rapid
french
she
mentioned
that
she
hoped
to
hear
much
interesting
conversation
from
the
form
this
morning
and
barbara
we
should
all
like
to
learn
your
opinion
on
the
channel
tunnel
barbara
became
pink
je
crois
bien
que
une
bonne
chose
pour
lesquels
qui
souffre
de
mal
de
mer
she
blundered
unhappily
mademoiselle
threw
up
her
hands
in
horror
is
it
that
i
am
taking
the
babies
of
the
kindergarten
she
inquired
how
often
am
i
to
tell
you
that
you
nefare
translate
literally
from
the
english
idiom
to
the
french
noreen
let
me
hear
you
noreen
cast
an
agonised
appeal
on
joey
what
i
think
about
the
channel
tunnel
mademoiselle
she
asked
en
français
vous
plaît
mon
enfant
noreen
stared
wildly
around
her
for
inspiration
je
pense
je
pense
continuez
said
mademoiselle
inexorably
je
pense
que
je
pas
des
pensées
sur
le
sujet
encore
poor
noreen
informed
her
miserably
fourteen
years
old
and
without
a
thought
on
a
subject
so
concerning
the
welfare
of
your
great
nation
mademoiselle
said
with
slow
scorn
it
is
a
pity
almost
that
you
have
a
nation
noreen
you
should
belong
to
some
miserable
little
german
state
where
la
patrie
is
represented
by
the
gendarme
with
his
big
fist
and
the
find
another
subject
that
you
can
talk
of
some
of
those
that
figure
in
the
paper
during
your
silly
season
will
suit
you
well
i
make
no
doubt
noreen
scarlet
about
the
ears
was
obviously
unable
to
find
a
subject
at
all
perhaps
it
was
not
wonderful
joey
burning
with
resentment
for
her
friend
rushed
into
the
breach
il
serait
tres
she
tried
to
think
of
the
word
for
improving
but
failing
to
see
even
a
glimpse
of
it
unfortunately
substituted
si
vous
voulez
dire
á
nous
chose
ou
deux
que
vous
avez
vue
pendant
la
guerre
de
quand
les
allemands
et
les
français
mademoiselle
swung
round
upon
the
daïs
and
looked
hard
at
joey
standing
up
in
her
place
rather
frightened
and
very
floundering
about
the
french
but
sturdily
determined
to
go
through
with
the
business
she
had
undertaken
mademoiselle
heard
her
out
with
no
comment
bad
or
good
till
she
reached
the
word
français
then
suddenly
her
heavy
black
eyes
gave
a
great
flash
you
are
i
think
a
new
girl
and
therefore
scarcely
know
perhaps
how
great
an
impertinence
you
commit
she
said
very
quietly
but
in
a
voice
that
was
more
dreadful
than
if
she
had
screamed
but
any
girl
that
is
worthy
of
the
name
of
english
should
understand
that
to
ask
a
frenchwoman
who
has
seen
and
remembers
to
her
with
stories
of
the
time
when
france
was
trodden
in
the
dust
by
is
to
make
an
insult
that
can
nefare
be
forgotten
leave
the
classroom
i
will
not
teach
such
a
girl
sybil
impart
to
me
your
views
on
the
best
length
for
summer
holidays
perhaps
that
will
not
be
beyond
your
range
of
intellect
joey
heard
no
more
somehow
she
reached
the
door
and
stumbled
out
feeling
so
indelibly
disgraced
that
she
had
serious
thoughts
of
taking
the
next
train
home
now
she
came
to
think
about
it
it
a
hopeless
thing
that
she
had
said
how
would
she
have
liked
it
if
the
girls
had
asked
her
joey
to
tell
them
a
funny
story
about
prisoners
of
war
in
german
hands
of
course
they
were
the
same
germans
at
least
the
fathers
of
the
horrible
huns
who
had
tortured
the
wounded
and
prisoners
and
hurt
little
children
like
tiddles
and
joey
had
used
that
word
when
mademoiselle
remembered
things
perhaps
as
bad
as
the
things
which
mums
had
never
wished
the
children
to
read
in
the
newspapers
if
i
knew
more
french
i
should
have
put
it
so
poor
joey
said
to
herself
but
it
did
occur
to
her
to
blame
noreen
and
syb
and
barbara
who
had
suggested
this
unfortunate
plan
in
the
first
instance
she
wandered
up
and
down
the
passage
in
a
kind
of
frenzy
she
would
have
to
go
home
but
honour
demanded
one
should
first
wipe
the
floor
with
oneself
before
the
outraged
maddy
joey
thought
no
french
lesson
could
ever
have
been
half
so
long
she
could
go
away
from
that
rather
dreary
and
viewless
passage
because
she
might
miss
maddy
when
she
came
out
the
temporary
mistress
who
was
taking
miss
craigie
place
would
go
to
the
classroom
as
soon
as
maddy
had
finished
that
was
all
joey
knew
at
last
there
were
steps
along
the
passage
but
it
was
the
senior
prefect
who
came
in
sight
she
had
a
little
note
in
her
hand
and
was
evidently
in
a
hurry
is
mademoiselle
still
with
remove
ii
b
she
asked
briskly
and
then
as
joey
murmured
yes
she
looked
at
her
it
the
scholarship
kid
is
it
but
why
are
you
in
class
i
was
turned
out
joey
mentioned
in
a
low
voice
then
you
must
have
been
behaving
like
a
young
silly
ingrid
told
her
crushingly
and
then
perhaps
she
saw
the
utter
misery
in
joey
face
but
there
no
need
to
be
so
tragic
about
it
do
you
suppose
the
only
girl
who
has
ever
been
turned
out
of
a
classroom
tell
mademoiselle
you
sorry
and
wo
do
it
again
and
do
do
it
again
that
all
with
which
excellent
advice
the
senior
prefect
knocked
at
the
classroom
door
and
went
in
with
her
note
leaving
joey
outside
to
wonder
miserably
if
ingrid
would
condescend
to
speak
to
her
at
all
if
she
knew
ingrid
came
out
and
passed
joey
with
a
nod
a
minute
later
there
were
other
steps
in
the
passage
and
the
temporary
mathematical
mistress
rather
blown
about
from
a
long
bicycle
ride
on
a
windy
day
hurried
down
towards
the
classroom
nervously
afraid
of
being
late
do
you
know
whether
mademoiselle
de
lavernais
has
come
out
yet
she
asked
no
she
has
are
you
waiting
for
my
class
are
you
in
remove
ii
b
by
the
way
the
mistress
said
joey
foresaw
rocks
and
shoals
i
so
new
i
do
know
what
i
to
take
and
what
i
not
she
temporised
well
come
in
with
me
and
we
see
the
other
girls
will
know
suggested
the
mistress
she
laid
a
friendly
hand
on
joey
shoulder
joey
wriggled
away
with
a
deplorable
lack
of
manners
and
bolted
up
the
passage
as
far
as
the
row
of
little
with
their
double
doors
she
could
let
herself
be
dragged
into
a
maths
class
without
at
least
trying
to
make
mademoiselle
see
that
she
had
not
meant
to
be
as
horribly
unfeeling
as
she
had
sounded
a
door
opened
and
shut
steps
rather
tired
halting
steps
came
towards
her
joey
screwed
up
her
courage
and
made
a
desperate
plunge
in
the
direction
of
the
small
black
shapeless
figure
advancing
towards
her
reading
a
note
do
you
mind
if
i
say
it
in
english
because
it
is
frightfully
hard
to
say
what
you
want
in
french
she
blurted
out
i
know
i
was
unspeakable
but
i
did
mean
it
truly
and
i
could
think
of
any
french
word
except
truthfully
french
such
a
slippy
language
when
you
trying
to
talk
i
did
mean
the
business
could
be
funny
and
my
father
was
killed
in
this
war
mademoiselle
de
lavernais
had
stopped
reading
her
note
when
joey
began
to
speak
but
she
said
nothing
at
all
till
joey
had
finished
her
black
eyes
were
fixed
unwaveringly
on
joey
face
so
fixedly
that
joey
wondered
vaguely
through
all
her
misery
if
she
had
an
ink
smudge
there
mademoiselle
suddenly
laid
a
hand
on
her
shoulder
and
drew
her
into
one
of
the
little
for
me
perhaps
also
the
words
i
used
said
what
i
did
not
altogether
mean
she
said
slowly
though
i
have
not
your
excuse
my
child
of
finding
your
language
having
been
in
this
country
since
i
was
more
young
than
you
i
think
i
was
not
just
to
say
you
were
not
english
because
you
did
not
understand
thank
you
awfully
joey
murmured
and
your
father
has
died
for
his
country
mademoiselle
went
on
mine
died
when
i
was
more
young
than
you
but
that
was
of
a
broken
heart
because
of
the
germans
winning
joey
ventured
my
home
was
in
alsace
said
mademoiselle
you
how
would
you
have
felt
if
the
great
foch
the
great
haig
and
the
great
americans
had
conquered
with
the
help
of
god
and
your
home
had
been
handed
over
to
the
hun
i
do
know
joey
said
it
was
unthinkable
you
do
know
you
are
fortunate
i
had
to
know
but
that
is
over
thank
god
we
have
waited
almost
fifty
years
but
it
is
over
mademoiselle
de
lavernais
seemed
to
have
forgotten
her
joey
thought
her
dull
black
eyes
had
lit
up
her
plain
tired
face
was
quite
transformed
joey
wondered
whether
she
ought
to
slip
out
and
go
to
the
maths
mistress
another
apology
would
certainly
be
needed
there
fortunately
mademoiselle
came
back
to
earth
in
a
minute
but
what
do
i
talk
of
we
should
both
be
at
our
classrooms
you
i
fear
will
be
in
trouble
in
that
you
are
late
my
class
will
merely
rejoice
that
cross
old
maddy
has
given
them
a
little
longer
of
liberty
to
chatter
in
english
should
you
not
be
at
mathematics
come
with
me
she
put
her
hand
again
on
joey
shoulder
and
they
went
down
the
passage
to
classroom
remove
ii
b
together
mademoiselle
knocked
and
went
in
miss
musgrave
you
will
of
your
kindness
i
hope
forgive
the
lateness
of
this
pupil
who
was
detained
by
me
not
by
her
fault
she
said
the
blame
is
all
mine
i
make
you
the
apologies
oh
of
course
that
is
all
right
mademoiselle
miss
musgrave
said
nervously
take
your
place
please
what
is
your
name
jocelyn
take
your
place
jocelyn
joey
could
thank
mademoiselle
in
the
middle
of
a
class
but
the
look
she
gave
her
was
eloquent
enough
mademoiselle
smiled
back
before
she
bowed
to
miss
musgrave
and
departed
to
her
own
class
remove
ii
b
discussed
the
extraordinary
incident
of
that
smile
all
through
the
interval
for
milk
and
buns
of
an
hour
later
chapter
x
a
sunday
out
cousin
greta
was
as
good
or
as
bad
as
her
word
joey
was
quite
sure
which
way
to
look
at
it
on
that
first
sunday
morning
while
she
with
the
twenty
other
girls
at
miss
lambton
table
was
enjoying
the
sunday
luxury
of
late
breakfast
and
hot
sausages
a
note
was
brought
to
miss
lambton
jocelyn
graham
she
called
joey
stood
up
miss
conyngham
has
sent
to
say
that
relations
are
coming
to
take
you
out
they
will
be
here
at
go
to
the
when
you
come
out
of
chapel
yes
miss
lambton
joey
sat
down
and
went
on
with
her
sausages
she
felt
rather
depressed
the
only
cheering
part
of
the
business
was
that
by
going
out
she
would
probably
escape
that
unknown
horror
of
saying
her
collect
epistle
and
gospel
and
being
questioned
on
them
noreen
was
sitting
two
places
away
what
are
they
aunts
uncles
or
what
are
they
good
for
chocolates
or
will
they
point
out
that
those
are
still
four
shillings
a
pound
and
schoolgirls
should
be
thankful
for
bread
and
margarine
i
expect
the
relation
is
my
cousin
greta
and
she
always
used
to
bring
us
chocolates
joey
answered
do
eat
them
all
on
the
way
home
think
of
your
precious
health
my
cried
half
a
dozen
imploring
voices
joey
could
take
chaff
better
now
besides
the
antipathy
of
the
redlanders
to
her
village
school
had
died
a
natural
and
speedy
death
i
better
think
of
yours
she
said
you
little
beast
muttered
noreen
but
rather
inaudibly
beast
being
one
of
the
expressions
that
even
miss
lambton
did
not
pass
at
table
there
was
a
walk
before
chapel
on
sundays
if
weather
allowed
joey
paired
off
with
gabrielle
on
this
occasion
and
found
her
sympathetic
over
the
outing
it
always
decent
going
out
when
you
at
school
even
if
it
to
the
stuffiest
people
she
explained
it
different
you
know
it
partly
there
was
a
girl
here
she
left
now
whose
only
relation
handy
was
a
who
was
quite
deaf
and
almost
blind
and
rather
childish
too
poor
thing
and
there
was
nothing
whatever
for
chrissie
to
do
at
her
house
but
play
with
the
cat
and
no
books
except
and
fairchild
but
chrissie
liked
going
all
the
same
you
see
she
could
tell
the
other
girls
she
had
a
good
time
when
she
came
back
and
that
was
something
yes
i
suppose
that
would
be
something
joey
agreed
and
went
to
get
ready
for
chapel
in
much
better
spirits
redlands
chapel
was
very
beautiful
later
on
joey
came
to
know
much
of
its
story
that
the
wonderful
black
chancel
screen
had
been
rescued
by
a
girl
father
from
an
old
barn
on
his
estate
and
went
back
to
the
stormy
times
of
henry
viii
devastating
war
upon
the
monasteries
that
the
beautiful
reredos
had
been
carved
by
an
old
pupil
of
the
college
who
had
gone
out
into
the
world
to
find
fame
three
of
the
windows
came
from
a
little
private
chapel
near
by
and
had
suffered
at
the
hands
of
cromwell
fifth
monarchy
men
she
stood
and
knelt
in
her
place
about
down
the
aisle
feeling
it
all
very
strange
after
the
plain
little
established
service
at
calgarloch
where
craigie
preached
for
an
hour
on
end
and
brought
sweeties
to
kirsty
and
bingo
in
the
afternoon
if
they
had
not
fidgeted
joey
liked
the
service
though
she
did
know
what
singing
could
be
till
the
second
hymn
the
college
always
refusing
to
throw
any
enthusiasm
into
the
strains
of
lord
behold
us
with
thy
blessing
once
again
assembled
here
but
with
the
second
onward
christian
soldiers
the
six
hundred
redlanders
fairly
let
go
swamping
choir
and
organ
joey
found
that
she
enjoyed
that
hymn
it
is
a
wonderful
feeling
to
join
in
with
that
crowd
she
forgot
that
she
had
been
rather
lonely
in
a
pew
full
of
strangers
with
gabrielle
and
noreen
both
far
away
from
her
in
the
choir
when
the
service
was
over
she
went
as
ordered
straight
to
miss
conyngham
room
where
she
found
cousin
greta
tall
thin
and
conversing
with
miss
conyngham
joey
offered
a
cheek
to
her
relative
with
exemplary
politeness
cousin
greta
kissed
her
and
then
held
her
at
arm
length
looking
at
her
critically
my
dear
child
what
a
beanstalk
for
only
thirteen
but
height
runs
in
the
family
she
added
to
miss
conyngham
my
cousin
this
father
was
six
foot
two
mums
is
tall
as
well
joey
put
in
aggressively
yes
i
suppose
she
is
agreed
cousin
greta
without
interest
are
you
ready
to
come
joey
i
will
bring
her
back
did
you
say
in
time
for
evening
chapel
very
good
miss
conyngham
cousin
greta
and
the
head
shook
hands
and
cousin
greta
laid
beautifully
gloved
fingers
on
joey
shoulders
and
walked
her
out
in
the
wake
of
the
perfect
to
the
front
door
where
her
daimler
was
waiting
joey
tried
to
look
riotously
happy
not
so
much
it
is
to
be
feared
from
motives
of
politeness
as
because
she
wanted
to
impress
the
other
girls
standing
about
in
little
groups
near
the
entrance
she
even
waved
condescendingly
to
one
of
the
two
big
girls
who
had
sat
beside
her
at
that
first
breakfast
and
taken
so
little
notice
of
her
presence
the
senior
tried
to
put
her
in
her
place
by
not
returning
the
wave
but
joey
knew
they
were
envious
all
the
same
of
course
they
know
what
a
stupid
sort
of
outing
she
was
really
going
to
have
and
how
do
you
like
redlands
asked
cousin
greta
as
the
car
slid
smoothly
down
the
drive
oh
all
right
joey
answered
still
with
caution
have
you
made
many
friends
yet
not
whole
ones
sort
of
half
what
you
mean
oh
i
like
some
of
the
girls
joey
said
getting
red
but
that
being
proper
friends
is
it
cousin
greta
did
know
joey
thought
she
had
been
an
idiot
to
try
and
answer
that
question
so
truthfully
she
might
have
realised
that
cousin
greta
would
be
likely
to
understand
and
for
the
next
ten
minutes
she
patiently
answered
questions
as
to
the
health
of
mums
the
boys
and
kirsty
her
own
place
in
form
and
she
also
told
cousin
greta
all
that
she
thought
cousin
greta
would
like
to
know
what
his
late
headmaster
had
said
about
gavin
the
good
place
ronnie
had
taken
bingo
funny
comment
when
the
schoolmaster
tried
to
teach
him
the
first
declension
i
sure
god
did
make
this
language
the
same
time
as
he
made
nice
fings
like
elephants
your
father
boys
would
have
brains
said
cousin
greta
approvingly
father
always
said
mums
had
twice
his
joey
fired
out
getting
hot
and
angry
your
father
was
very
modest
cousin
greta
said
but
she
sighed
it
occurred
to
joey
that
perhaps
cousin
greta
disliked
the
day
together
quite
as
much
as
she
herself
did
she
made
an
effort
to
be
pleasant
perhaps
after
all
cousin
greta
did
mean
to
slight
mums
it
was
only
her
stupid
way
of
talking
do
tell
me
about
father
when
he
was
a
little
boy
she
asked
if
you
peep
at
the
glass
in
my
room
when
we
come
to
mote
house
you
will
know
just
what
he
looked
like
lady
greta
told
her
more
cheerfully
joey
stared
am
i
like
him
i
never
knew
that
i
see
the
likeness
cousin
greta
said
and
was
silent
for
a
little
while
the
car
flew
along
the
straight
marsh
road
at
a
most
exhilarating
pace
i
suppose
your
mother
never
heard
anything
more
after
the
letter
from
that
which
she
sent
me
she
asked
at
last
no
nothing
though
mums
wrote
and
wrote
and
went
to
meet
the
batch
of
prisoners
from
wilhelmgradt
after
the
armistice
and
uncle
staff
went
on
going
to
the
war
office
it
was
a
great
blow
to
us
all
said
lady
greta
joey
bit
back
the
remark
that
it
was
worst
for
mums
after
all
mums
would
have
liked
her
to
say
it
there
was
a
little
silence
gracie
is
looking
forward
to
seeing
you
cousin
greta
went
on
at
last
let
me
see
she
is
just
two
years
older
than
you
are
i
suppose
she
does
go
to
school
does
she
no
i
am
afraid
i
am
not
quite
a
believer
in
school
for
girls
besides
she
has
such
a
delightful
governess
miss
richards
joey
supposed
how
nice
for
her
was
the
proper
thing
to
say
and
said
it
and
that
remark
brought
them
to
mote
court
gracie
met
them
at
the
door
a
pretty
but
girl
very
beautifully
dressed
when
joey
shook
hands
with
her
she
suddenly
realised
that
her
own
stockings
were
darned
in
the
leg
where
the
darn
showed
a
good
deal
however
gracie
was
quite
polite
and
carried
her
guest
off
to
her
own
room
to
take
off
her
coat
and
hat
and
wash
her
hands
for
luncheon
and
then
to
the
schoolroom
where
miss
richards
was
sitting
playing
halma
with
a
spare
freckled
boy
who
was
lying
on
the
sofa
covered
with
a
rug
gracie
introduced
miss
richards
and
then
the
boy
as
my
cousin
john
joey
liked
the
look
of
john
though
his
best
friends
could
have
called
him
anything
but
plain
but
he
had
a
pleasant
and
companionable
grin
and
a
much
more
vigorous
way
of
shaking
hands
than
either
gracie
or
miss
richards
we
had
better
put
away
the
halma
men
john
said
miss
richards
the
luncheon
gong
will
go
directly
and
you
will
like
to
talk
to
little
friend
joey
wriggled
inwardly
at
this
description
but
went
and
sat
down
by
john
sofa
anyhow
he
looked
easier
to
talk
to
than
gracie
i
know
you
lived
here
she
said
i
do
john
told
her
but
i
had
a
you
see
and
aunt
greta
asked
me
here
to
get
fit
again
john
is
in
the
navy
gracie
explained
he
a
middy
on
the
a
snotty
corrected
john
in
a
warning
growl
you
at
school
here
are
you
he
added
turning
to
joey
i
at
redlands
that
the
big
place
out
beyond
the
round
tower
yes
i
say
do
you
know
anything
about
the
tower
joey
asked
breathlessly
aunt
greta
the
one
to
ask
she
lives
here
why
are
you
specially
keen
on
towers
joey
comes
from
scotland
gracie
said
as
though
a
tower
were
an
unknown
spectacle
in
the
north
joey
was
just
going
to
explain
that
what
specially
interested
her
was
not
so
much
the
tower
as
the
queer
lights
that
came
from
it
when
the
gong
for
luncheon
sounded
with
a
roar
and
gracie
got
up
come
along
joey
john
has
his
lunch
up
here
rather
dull
for
john
joey
thought
as
she
followed
her
cousin
obediently
along
corridors
and
downstairs
to
the
she
would
have
liked
to
ask
about
him
and
whether
he
would
soon
be
better
but
was
afraid
of
seeming
inquisitive
so
left
gracie
and
miss
richards
to
make
polite
conversation
in
the
she
was
presented
to
colonel
sturt
who
was
bald
and
rather
morose
and
gave
her
two
fingers
only
when
she
shook
hands
then
cousin
greta
motioned
joey
to
a
chair
on
her
own
right
and
luncheon
began
it
was
a
very
grand
luncheon
mindful
of
what
gabrielle
had
said
joey
stored
up
an
exact
description
of
the
mayonnaise
and
roast
chickens
the
cold
sirloin
and
wonderful
salad
the
trifle
meringues
and
tartlets
they
at
least
would
be
something
to
tell
the
girls
about
cousin
greta
saw
to
it
that
joey
made
an
excellent
meal
but
it
was
certainly
a
dull
one
colonel
sturt
was
upset
by
something
he
had
read
in
his
paper
about
germans
creeping
back
into
the
country
and
gracie
was
almost
as
obviously
annoyed
by
her
mother
refusal
to
let
her
do
something
or
other
that
she
wanted
that
afternoon
she
did
talk
to
joey
a
little
but
the
two
years
between
them
seemed
to
make
an
impossible
gulf
joey
thought
it
was
really
rather
a
comfort
when
the
long
grand
luncheon
was
over
even
though
cousin
greta
swept
joey
off
to
her
own
room
for
a
little
talk
rather
an
alarming
suggestion
cousin
greta
room
was
a
world
of
joey
saw
her
own
slim
self
reflected
everywhere
a
self
who
looked
oddly
spruce
and
tidy
in
the
dark
green
velveteen
best
frock
of
redlands
and
with
her
mass
of
fair
hair
tied
neatly
back
with
a
dark
green
bow
her
brown
eyes
under
black
lashes
looked
rather
seriously
back
at
this
new
tidy
self
reflected
cousin
greta
came
behind
joey
and
laid
two
hands
on
her
shoulders
and
now
barring
the
clothes
you
know
how
your
dear
father
used
to
look
when
he
came
to
us
for
his
holidays
she
said
and
joey
felt
sorry
for
cousin
greta
suddenly
and
as
though
she
were
minding
a
good
deal
about
father
under
all
her
cold
languid
ways
i
glad
i
like
she
said
though
he
wanted
us
all
to
be
like
mums
but
i
never
be
anything
like
him
in
splendidness
worse
luck
now
the
war
is
over
there
is
even
a
chance
of
serving
your
country
cousin
greta
shivered
my
dear
child
do
talk
as
though
you
were
sorry
this
ghastly
war
is
over
which
was
one
of
the
speeches
that
set
joey
teeth
on
edge
and
were
impossible
to
answer
she
said
no
more
and
cousin
greta
took
a
tremendous
box
of
chocolates
from
the
chest
of
drawers
and
told
joey
she
was
to
take
them
back
with
her
to
school
then
she
mentioned
that
she
always
rested
for
an
hour
after
luncheon
and
did
joey
think
she
could
find
her
way
back
to
the
schoolroom
where
she
would
find
gracie
joey
thanked
cousin
greta
and
was
sure
she
could
and
in
due
course
and
after
taking
two
or
three
wrong
turnings
she
found
herself
back
at
the
schoolroom
door
she
heard
no
sound
of
voices
it
did
not
sound
as
though
anybody
were
inside
and
sure
enough
when
she
opened
the
door
she
found
nobody
in
the
room
but
john
he
grinned
at
her
in
a
friendly
fashion
where
gracie
he
asked
i
do
know
joey
said
she
took
some
credit
to
herself
for
not
adding
i
do
care
john
laughed
well
come
and
talk
to
me
till
she
comes
along
joey
established
herself
on
a
chair
by
his
sofa
what
do
you
do
when
you
a
snotty
she
asked
we
know
more
about
the
army
you
see
keep
a
look
out
when
the
deck
all
ice
mostly
john
said
of
course
sometimes
there
was
a
scrap
not
half
often
enough
though
and
when
you
get
your
signal
you
to
be
jolly
quick
or
the
other
chap
snaffles
it
all
how
do
you
signal
joey
asked
wireless
mostly
of
course
you
have
to
know
all
kinds
of
signals
can
you
read
morse
no
i
ca
i
teach
you
it
as
easy
as
winking
and
john
kept
his
word
joey
was
fairly
safe
on
the
morse
alphabet
in
half
an
hour
and
felt
immensely
pleased
with
herself
she
was
only
too
delighted
that
gracie
stayed
away
so
long
she
was
beginning
to
enjoy
herself
for
the
first
time
that
day
john
directed
her
to
a
where
there
was
an
electric
torch
and
a
whistle
he
took
the
torch
and
she
the
whistle
and
she
went
over
to
the
window
to
make
her
first
attempt
at
sending
in
morse
she
boggled
rather
over
it
and
had
to
be
prompted
in
two
or
three
letters
but
john
was
encouraging
and
assured
her
she
was
picking
it
up
very
quickly
then
he
proceeded
to
reply
very
slowly
with
long
and
short
flashes
from
the
electric
torch
directly
he
began
joey
knew
of
what
it
reminded
her
the
curious
blue
flashes
she
had
seen
from
the
leads
on
that
first
night
she
was
at
school
she
meant
to
ask
john
about
them
after
he
had
finished
his
morse
sentence
just
now
that
needed
all
her
concentration
long
short
long
short
she
spelt
out
c
is
that
right
john
short
long
do
tell
me
i
know
a
long
short
oh
that
the
opposite
do
tell
me
right
group
said
john
ready
for
next
word
he
flashed
short
long
long
long
joey
almost
shrieked
in
her
excitement
it
was
a
letter
like
that
she
had
seen
in
the
rainy
darkness
from
the
leads
j
she
spelt
and
then
she
felt
she
must
tell
john
about
that
light
without
waiting
for
the
slow
laborious
spelling
out
of
the
next
word
she
was
just
going
to
speak
but
she
had
to
see
what
the
next
letter
was
and
in
that
instant
she
was
seeing
gracie
spoke
under
the
widely
opened
window
gracie
voice
was
very
clear
and
every
syllable
came
quite
distinctly
up
to
joey
at
the
window
yes
i
awfully
annoyed
about
it
eleanor
but
i
ca
get
mother
to
see
reason
i
suppose
she
feels
she
ought
to
be
nice
to
this
child
who
is
a
sort
of
cousin
but
it
could
have
hurt
her
to
go
back
an
hour
or
two
earlier
and
leave
the
car
free
for
me
at
the
time
i
want
it
as
it
is
mother
says
she
is
going
to
send
the
little
nuisance
back
till
six
what
a
shame
i
should
strike
at
small
schoolgirl
cousins
who
have
to
be
kept
all
day
and
sent
back
in
the
car
that
was
another
voice
evidently
the
voice
of
the
girl
to
whom
gracie
was
talking
joey
forgot
all
about
morse
and
faced
john
with
hot
cheeks
i
wo
do
any
more
signalling
i
think
thanks
no
end
for
teaching
me
she
said
i
go
and
find
miss
richards
or
someone
john
held
out
a
thin
scarred
hand
i
say
do
you
worry
about
gracie
he
growled
shocking
bad
form
to
talk
like
that
but
she
does
mean
it
i
do
want
to
be
sent
back
in
the
car
poor
joey
burst
out
only
six
miles
who
wants
a
car
she
stopped
it
was
possible
to
tell
john
who
was
gracie
cousin
that
what
hurt
so
much
in
the
speech
was
the
sense
that
they
all
thought
her
a
nuisance
who
must
be
entertained
as
a
duty
perhaps
john
had
really
been
finding
her
a
nuisance
too
when
he
taught
her
signalling
joey
one
thought
was
to
get
away
from
all
thanks
awfully
for
being
so
nice
to
me
she
said
but
i
go
now
if
you
do
mind
here
wait
a
bit
john
urged
but
joey
was
already
through
the
door
and
out
in
the
passage
she
would
say
and
thank
you
to
cousin
greta
and
ask
if
she
might
walk
home
as
it
was
such
a
lovely
afternoon
but
then
poor
joey
remembered
that
cousin
greta
was
lying
down
and
must
not
be
disturbed
what
could
she
do
joey
suddenly
entertained
the
quite
reprehensible
idea
of
saying
nothing
to
anybody
but
walking
home
all
by
herself
chapter
xi
the
it
was
all
quite
easy
she
had
taken
off
her
coat
and
hat
in
gracie
room
joey
made
her
way
there
hurried
into
her
things
and
ran
downstairs
she
only
met
one
servant
the
place
was
in
a
dozy
condition
she
got
out
at
a
side
door
and
avoiding
the
front
drive
where
she
thought
she
might
be
seen
and
stopped
she
darted
away
over
lawns
crossed
the
at
a
jump
and
landed
in
the
park
here
she
slightly
slackened
her
headlong
pace
nobody
would
see
her
among
the
trees
and
began
to
compose
her
letter
of
apology
to
cousin
greta
she
supposed
she
was
being
dreadfully
rude
and
it
was
a
rudeness
which
would
be
horribly
difficult
to
explain
without
complaining
of
gracie
naturally
an
unspeakable
idea
she
had
only
got
as
far
as
dear
cousin
greta
i
hope
i
was
not
very
rude
but
when
she
cleared
the
park
and
crossed
the
straight
marsh
road
she
had
decided
to
go
by
the
fields
in
case
somebody
should
be
sent
after
her
if
she
kept
in
a
line
with
the
road
even
at
a
distance
of
half
a
mile
or
so
on
the
side
she
would
be
quite
safe
she
thought
she
gave
a
glance
around
her
to
make
sure
of
the
lie
of
the
land
it
was
all
quite
easy
for
the
october
afternoon
was
clear
and
a
peculiar
transparent
luminosity
lay
on
the
glittering
horizon
then
she
plunged
forward
concocting
her
letter
to
cousin
greta
as
she
went
it
must
certainly
be
written
and
sent
off
for
there
was
no
question
about
it
she
had
been
disgracefully
rude
only
she
could
go
on
being
a
nuisance
to
people
who
did
want
her
and
invited
her
out
only
from
a
sense
of
duty
dear
cousin
greta
i
hope
i
was
not
very
rude
but
i
found
i
had
to
get
back
earlier
than
i
expected
and
and
i
want
to
disturb
you
as
you
were
lying
down
joey
did
know
that
in
the
struggle
to
compose
that
difficult
letter
of
apology
to
cousin
greta
she
had
diverged
a
little
from
the
straight
line
that
she
had
fixed
for
herself
and
was
bearing
down
farther
from
the
road
with
every
step
she
took
the
letter
took
a
great
deal
of
pumping
out
one
had
to
try
and
be
truthful
and
at
the
same
time
no
telltale
when
politeness
had
to
come
in
as
well
it
made
each
sentence
most
terribly
difficult
and
joey
wrestled
with
that
letter
in
much
affliction
of
spirit
and
went
farther
and
farther
out
of
her
way
without
ever
seeing
where
she
was
going
the
bit
about
not
wanting
to
disturb
cousin
greta
was
not
absolutely
true
because
joey
had
been
really
glad
she
had
been
lying
down
still
perhaps
it
might
pass
one
could
say
one
was
glad
anyway
it
was
very
kind
of
you
to
have
me
out
joe
went
on
thank
you
most
awfully
about
my
going
back
to
redlands
alone
i
always
go
about
alone
at
home
unless
one
of
the
others
happens
to
be
with
me
so
i
hope
you
wo
mind
that
i
not
a
kid
you
know
your
affectionate
cousin
joey
joey
finished
the
letter
in
her
mind
and
said
it
over
to
herself
it
would
take
long
to
write
down
that
was
one
comfort
and
she
hoped
it
would
make
cousin
greta
understand
she
was
quite
the
girl
she
had
seemed
and
as
she
finished
saying
it
and
got
it
finally
off
her
chest
she
knew
suddenly
that
she
was
very
cold
and
that
a
clammy
white
wall
was
surrounding
her
on
every
side
that
beneath
her
feet
was
green
bogginess
and
of
the
road
or
any
landmark
there
was
not
so
much
as
a
trace
joey
had
heard
of
the
in
books
but
that
did
make
her
very
clear
about
it
now
she
met
it
she
could
think
how
such
a
thick
fog
could
have
come
up
without
her
noticing
it
but
here
it
was
that
was
very
certain
she
began
to
wish
that
she
had
kept
to
the
high
road
or
left
the
composition
of
that
difficult
letter
till
she
got
back
to
redlands
however
the
roke
was
here
and
she
was
on
the
deeps
and
not
the
road
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
keep
as
straight
on
as
possible
or
better
still
turn
to
her
left
and
strike
the
road
joey
settled
that
would
be
the
wisest
thing
to
do
even
if
it
took
her
out
of
her
way
at
first
she
turned
to
the
left
and
went
as
straight
as
she
could
the
road
seemed
to
take
a
very
long
time
to
be
reached
joey
think
how
she
could
have
come
so
far
from
it
she
stumbled
on
and
on
finding
the
ground
very
quaggy
and
walking
exceedingly
difficult
and
then
she
jumped
back
only
just
in
time
for
she
had
all
but
walked
into
one
of
those
deep
ditches
with
slanting
sides
that
drain
the
deeps
at
intervals
and
are
a
very
real
danger
with
their
thick
ooze
of
mud
below
the
water
and
their
slippery
banks
joey
knew
that
she
had
crossed
no
ditch
on
her
way
down
from
the
road
she
began
to
feel
a
little
pricking
of
uneasiness
she
was
very
very
tired
her
legs
ached
and
she
seemed
to
herself
to
have
walked
miles
and
miles
through
this
cold
clammy
white
wall
and
if
she
could
strike
the
road
how
much
farther
might
she
not
have
to
go
and
was
all
this
struggling
getting
her
any
nearer
to
redlands
joey
was
not
a
nervous
person
but
she
sat
down
at
the
side
of
the
dyke
to
try
and
get
her
bearings
with
rather
a
sinking
heart
she
had
just
remembered
that
in
a
fog
you
tend
to
wander
in
a
circle
could
she
have
been
doing
that
all
this
long
time
when
she
hoped
that
she
was
at
least
getting
on
a
little
what
a
bally
nuisance
she
said
aloud
of
course
one
acknowledge
even
to
oneself
that
it
was
anything
worse
than
that
i
suppose
i
had
better
wait
till
the
fog
lifts
she
said
wondering
whether
it
were
the
close
white
wall
or
the
sinking
sensation
under
her
belt
that
made
her
voice
so
hollow
and
just
as
she
said
it
there
came
a
little
breeze
and
the
roke
lifted
for
a
minute
hanging
around
like
clouds
that
wanted
to
settle
on
the
earth
and
quite
make
up
their
minds
to
do
so
and
joey
saw
some
thirty
yards
away
from
her
not
the
road
there
was
no
sign
of
that
but
a
narrow
plank
bridge
that
crossed
the
dyke
and
straight
in
a
line
with
it
the
mysterious
round
tower
joey
did
not
waste
a
minute
she
ran
for
her
life
and
was
over
the
bridge
before
the
roke
came
down
again
baffling
clinging
frightening
but
the
tower
was
so
near
and
there
was
no
dyke
between
she
had
seen
that
she
ran
straight
on
in
the
white
darkness
and
fell
breathlessly
against
the
rough
wall
of
the
tower
five
minutes
later
the
roke
was
thicker
than
ever
after
that
momentary
lifting
but
joey
did
care
now
there
was
shelter
and
safety
in
the
tower
and
she
felt
as
though
having
reached
it
was
the
next
best
thing
to
being
safe
at
redlands
noreen
had
told
her
it
really
was
a
good
four
miles
from
the
college
but
it
seemed
comfortingly
close
when
one
remembered
that
night
on
the
leads
joey
felt
her
way
round
it
until
she
came
to
a
narrow
door
standing
at
least
three
feet
above
the
ground
she
felt
the
ledge
on
which
the
door
opened
with
her
fingers
scrambled
up
to
it
and
tried
the
door
it
was
fastened
but
she
carried
a
strong
and
inserting
the
stoutest
blade
into
the
chink
she
forced
back
the
bolt
which
secured
it
on
the
inside
and
opened
the
door
then
with
a
delightful
thrill
of
mystery
she
scrambled
through
into
the
tower
it
was
inside
not
as
it
was
out
for
the
one
narrow
window
on
this
ground
floor
was
shuttered
joey
longed
for
an
electric
torch
she
stumbled
on
a
cautious
step
or
two
then
growing
bolder
walked
on
three
or
four
more
with
hands
outstretched
her
hands
came
into
contact
with
a
narrow
shelf
and
on
it
joy
she
felt
a
joey
struck
a
match
feeling
as
though
all
her
troubles
were
over
the
flash
gave
her
a
rough
notion
of
grey
walls
and
an
iron
ladder
running
up
almost
perpendicularly
to
the
right
of
her
and
it
showed
something
else
as
well
a
lantern
that
stood
upon
the
same
shelf
where
she
had
found
the
matches
joey
seized
upon
it
as
a
shipwrecked
mariner
might
on
a
spar
and
lit
it
holding
it
in
her
hand
she
felt
strong
enough
to
face
anything
it
was
the
darkness
which
had
been
so
frightening
holding
the
lantern
on
high
she
set
out
to
explore
her
refuge
after
all
for
whatever
reason
it
was
rather
exciting
to
find
oneself
in
the
mysterious
round
tower
at
last
the
floor
above
was
so
high
that
the
rays
of
her
lantern
could
not
reach
it
but
she
was
sure
there
was
another
floor
because
of
the
ladder
which
obviously
must
lead
somewhere
joey
thought
she
would
go
up
it
presently
and
see
for
herself
but
at
present
the
ground
floor
of
the
tower
presented
attractions
it
was
strewn
with
a
quantity
of
loose
stones
and
débris
of
all
kinds
except
in
one
place
one
can
hardly
say
corner
in
a
round
tower
where
it
would
seem
to
have
been
swept
smooth
joey
having
wandered
round
the
grey
walls
examining
them
with
interest
came
to
the
place
where
the
débris
was
comparatively
scanty
and
held
her
lantern
down
to
light
the
place
a
voice
came
up
to
her
from
below
the
floor
a
rather
thin
peevish
voice
that
sounded
exceedingly
tired
and
had
a
curious
accent
you
are
at
least
two
hours
earlier
than
you
said
you
would
be
how
can
you
then
expect
me
to
be
ready
joey
quite
jumped
the
voice
was
so
entirely
unexpected
then
she
realised
that
she
must
be
taken
for
somebody
else
i
ca
be
anyone
you
expected
two
hours
later
because
i
did
know
myself
about
walking
home
and
this
old
fog
she
said
do
tell
me
are
you
down
a
or
what
a
square
of
floor
lifted
with
some
difficulty
and
a
head
appeared
the
head
of
a
pale
young
man
with
large
startled
blue
eyes
i
say
i
hope
i
did
frighten
you
coming
in
like
this
joey
said
politely
but
the
fog
the
i
think
they
call
it
is
so
beastly
and
i
could
find
my
way
back
the
young
man
came
altogether
out
from
the
joey
did
think
much
of
his
nerves
his
hands
were
trembling
and
he
looked
as
though
gavin
could
have
knocked
him
down
quite
easily
do
you
live
here
joey
asked
as
he
did
not
speak
i
hope
you
mind
my
coming
in
like
this
but
noreen
one
of
the
redlands
girls
tells
me
that
the
deeps
are
really
rather
dangerous
when
the
roke
is
about
the
young
man
seemed
to
recover
his
breath
you
are
a
redlands
young
lady
are
you
surely
your
mistress
does
not
know
that
you
are
wandering
about
the
deeps
alone
miss
conyngham
no
i
do
suppose
she
does
joey
said
easily
i
did
know
myself
till
it
happened
but
of
course
i
ought
to
have
come
by
the
road
illustration
i
hope
i
did
frighten
you
coming
in
like
this
joey
said
politely
it
would
be
safer
the
young
man
said
impressively
he
did
not
answer
joey
question
about
living
in
the
tower
but
proceeded
to
tell
her
story
upon
story
of
accidents
happening
on
the
deeps
to
people
who
strayed
there
in
the
fog
or
the
dark
joey
thought
his
stories
were
a
little
like
the
from
his
account
the
perpetually
lay
in
wait
in
company
with
horrid
oozy
spots
where
people
disappeared
with
no
trace
left
to
tell
how
they
had
died
his
stories
were
so
interesting
that
joey
forgot
her
desire
to
explore
and
sat
by
his
side
on
a
great
block
of
fallen
stone
listening
with
all
her
ears
and
foreseeing
a
thrilling
time
in
blue
dorm
this
evening
she
was
so
absorbed
that
she
never
noticed
the
lightening
of
the
roke
until
a
long
narrow
bar
of
sunshine
fell
through
a
chink
in
the
shutters
of
the
window
making
the
red
glow
of
the
lantern
look
pale
and
unnatural
then
she
jumped
up
in
a
hurry
and
held
out
her
hand
the
post
went
out
at
six
on
sundays
and
she
still
had
four
miles
to
walk
before
she
could
write
that
apology
to
cousin
greta
she
must
go
at
once
now
it
would
be
safe
to
cross
the
piece
of
to
the
road
she
held
out
her
hand
to
the
young
man
she
said
you
been
a
brick
to
me
and
i
enjoyed
your
stories
most
awfully
i
had
no
end
of
a
good
time
here
and
jolly
thrilling
when
you
have
done
it
to
know
you
might
have
been
drowned
so
easily
is
it
it
been
a
topping
afternoon
thanks
ever
so
she
shook
hands
with
the
young
man
whose
easily
scared
breath
seemed
to
have
departed
again
for
he
gasped
and
said
nothing
joey
turned
her
back
upon
the
round
tower
and
turned
her
face
in
the
direction
of
the
road
now
plainly
to
be
seen
it
was
not
till
she
had
reached
it
that
it
struck
her
that
she
had
been
rather
stupid
not
to
ask
leave
to
come
again
and
bring
her
friends
but
perhaps
now
the
young
man
was
used
to
her
he
would
mind
if
three
or
four
of
them
turned
up
one
afternoon
and
asked
for
some
more
of
his
stories
and
permission
to
explore
joey
settled
in
her
own
mind
that
she
would
share
the
privilege
with
noreen
and
gabrielle
at
least
but
one
could
go
back
to
ask
leave
with
the
thought
of
the
six
post
and
that
letter
of
apology
still
to
be
written
for
it
joey
covered
the
ground
at
her
best
pace
never
looking
back
reached
the
road
quite
successfully
and
by
dint
of
running
most
of
the
way
arrived
panting
at
the
side
door
of
redlands
just
as
the
gong
sounded
for
five
tea
chapter
xii
in
trouble
joey
slipped
into
her
place
at
table
hoping
that
miss
lambton
would
not
notice
her
grubby
hands
and
rough
hair
there
had
only
been
just
time
to
tear
off
her
coat
and
hat
in
the
nearest
cloakroom
belonging
to
the
sixth
form
by
right
tidying
had
to
go
by
the
board
she
squeezed
in
between
noreen
and
barbara
i
got
a
scrummy
box
of
chocs
she
whispered
noreen
gave
quite
a
start
hullo
you
turned
up
half
the
lower
school
have
been
leading
weary
lives
about
you
this
afternoon
why
demanded
joey
oh
your
cousin
apparently
and
said
you
gone
off
by
yourself
and
the
chauffeur
could
see
you
along
the
road
and
then
the
roke
came
up
and
they
were
afraid
something
might
happen
to
you
likely
i
not
a
kid
joey
stated
with
immense
scorn
but
awfully
sorry
anyone
bothered
am
i
in
a
row
so
what
possessed
you
to
bolt
off
like
that
you
goat
oh
i
do
know
i
wanted
to
come
back
you
cracked
i
think
barbara
said
uncompromisingly
do
you
know
girls
are
always
sent
back
when
they
at
school
i
could
know
there
was
going
to
be
such
a
rotten
old
fuss
about
it
joey
complained
however
if
i
in
for
it
i
am
i
got
the
chocs
anyhow
we
orgy
in
blue
dorm
jocelyn
graham
miss
lambton
spoke
sharply
from
her
end
of
her
table
hurry
with
your
tea
please
and
then
go
to
miss
conyngham
yes
miss
lambton
joey
answered
ruefully
and
then
added
to
noreen
hope
she
leave
me
time
to
write
and
apologise
to
cousin
greta
you
be
lucky
if
she
finished
rowing
you
by
noreen
remarked
unkindly
but
added
after
a
second
do
worry
i
suppose
you
catch
it
much
as
you
new
say
you
did
know
say
there
insanity
in
the
family
and
you
it
is
coming
out
suggested
barbara
but
joey
was
too
much
depressed
to
be
drawn
by
this
remark
she
finished
her
tea
in
haste
and
was
dispatched
by
miss
lambton
to
miss
conyngham
without
waiting
for
grace
miss
conyngham
come
in
was
rather
severe
joey
screwed
up
her
courage
and
opened
the
door
please
miss
lambton
said
i
was
to
come
she
said
meekly
miss
conyngham
was
standing
by
the
fire
she
looked
tall
and
imposing
much
taller
and
more
terrifying
than
in
that
first
interview
poor
joey
thought
what
have
you
been
doing
jocelyn
she
asked
and
her
voice
though
quiet
was
very
cold
joey
pulled
herself
together
i
very
sorry
if
it
was
the
right
thing
she
said
but
i
came
away
earlier
from
my
cousin
because
because
i
wanted
to
and
made
up
my
letter
of
apology
truly
quite
a
polite
one
and
if
you
could
finish
rowing
me
in
time
for
the
post
i
should
be
frightfully
obliged
because
mums
hates
impoliteness
miss
conyngham
said
nothing
for
a
minute
but
looked
attentively
at
joey
you
are
thirteen
i
think
she
said
at
last
old
enough
to
understand
that
you
have
done
rather
an
inexcusable
thing
this
afternoon
if
it
had
been
little
bertillia
i
should
not
have
been
surprised
one
expects
a
baby
to
occasionally
act
on
an
absurd
impulse
and
that
is
why
babies
are
in
charge
of
someone
always
you
are
a
girl
of
thirteen
with
plenty
of
brains
if
you
choose
to
make
use
of
them
and
yet
because
presumably
you
were
not
enjoying
yourself
you
were
guilty
of
very
gross
discourtesy
towards
your
cousin
and
of
a
breach
of
trust
towards
me
i
grant
that
perhaps
you
did
not
understand
it
is
a
college
rule
that
no
girl
goes
out
alone
but
you
heard
me
arrange
with
your
cousin
to
bring
you
back
in
time
for
chapel
at
so
you
knew
what
my
wishes
were
yes
murmured
joey
staring
hard
at
a
picture
opposite
a
little
patch
of
purple
heather
and
a
group
of
yellowing
birches
that
reminded
her
of
calgarloch
and
home
noreen
and
barbara
had
prepared
her
for
a
row
but
she
had
been
prepared
for
the
horrid
effect
of
the
head
quiet
cold
voice
your
cousin
telephoned
here
in
great
anxiety
when
she
found
that
you
had
gone
miss
conyngham
went
on
and
when
there
was
no
sign
of
you
on
the
road
we
all
knew
you
must
be
coming
by
the
deeps
in
the
you
did
a
very
dangerous
as
well
as
a
very
wrong
thing
jocelyn
do
you
know
that
the
man
in
the
tower
told
me
so
most
kindly
joey
explained
but
i
did
do
it
on
purpose
honour
and
i
had
a
reason
a
real
proper
reason
for
leaving
cousin
greta
on
my
own
only
it
was
one
i
could
say
to
her
it
just
not
enjoying
myself
i
was
enjoying
myself
quite
with
john
that
is
gracie
snotty
cousin
worth
ten
of
her
any
day
that
will
do
interrupted
miss
conyngham
i
am
glad
you
had
any
reason
in
what
you
did
but
nothing
can
make
it
excusable
i
have
always
been
proud
to
trust
our
redlands
girls
in
every
way
do
you
realise
that
when
you
act
as
you
have
done
you
are
bringing
discredit
on
us
all
and
a
girl
owes
loyalty
to
her
school
above
everything
joey
swallowed
hard
well
i
frightfully
sorry
miss
conyngham
i
i
should
think
you
had
better
punish
me
only
might
i
go
now
because
of
writing
to
cousin
greta
you
had
better
telephone
to
your
cousin
miss
conyngham
said
gravely
i
will
put
you
through
in
a
minute
yes
i
think
you
must
be
punished
not
because
i
am
angry
but
to
help
you
to
remember
you
are
not
to
talk
to
the
others
in
blue
dormitory
for
a
week
and
go
to
bed
directly
after
supper
during
that
time
do
you
think
you
can
remember
joey
gasped
you
could
make
it
french
verbs
instead
i
awful
at
french
verbs
ask
maddy
people
do
choose
their
own
punishments
jocelyn
the
head
told
her
with
the
ghost
of
a
smile
it
must
be
as
i
said
can
you
remember
do
you
think
you
see
i
am
trusting
to
your
honour
yes
i
remember
joey
said
mournfully
but
it
will
be
beastly
i
hope
it
will
square
up
all
the
bother
i
given
you
a
bit
though
we
will
see
what
it
can
do
said
miss
conyngham
in
a
kinder
voice
now
i
will
put
you
through
to
your
cousin
the
telephone
was
still
rather
a
mystery
to
joey
but
she
squeezed
the
middle
of
the
receiver
as
miss
conyngham
directed
and
said
hullo
then
miss
conyngham
went
out
and
left
her
is
that
you
cousin
greta
joey
inquired
in
a
unnatural
voice
then
please
i
most
awfully
sorry
and
i
did
mean
to
be
rude
or
make
you
anxious
just
i
thought
i
better
come
home
early
cousin
greta
interrupted
i
know
dear
john
told
me
do
think
any
more
about
it
i
am
only
too
thankful
you
are
safe
you
must
come
over
on
another
sunday
very
soon
and
we
will
try
and
give
you
a
really
happy
time
joey
felt
more
choky
than
she
had
done
through
all
miss
harangue
it
no
end
brickish
of
you
she
stammered
forgetting
to
speak
in
what
she
thought
was
a
telephone
voice
and
becoming
much
more
audible
in
consequence
you
were
fearfully
kind
and
it
frightfully
nice
of
you
not
to
be
mad
she
rang
off
and
went
to
find
her
chocolates
feeling
distinctly
happier
she
met
noreen
in
the
passage
and
thrust
the
box
into
her
hands
look
here
you
better
keep
them
and
orgie
she
said
i
not
to
talk
for
a
week
in
dorm
what
a
sickening
shame
but
we
keep
the
chocs
till
the
week
up
noreen
said
cheerfully
my
will
do
matron
never
pokes
her
nose
into
that
keep
smiling
old
thing
it
rotten
i
know
but
simply
have
the
bust
of
our
lives
when
the
week
up
and
you
clear
joey
went
up
to
bed
directly
after
supper
that
night
as
commanded
but
feeling
less
depressed
than
might
have
been
expected
for
one
thing
miss
conyngham
had
addressed
her
in
quite
an
ordinary
tone
at
supper
for
another
cousin
greta
had
been
so
unexpectedly
nice
and
friendship
came
in
a
good
third
joey
looked
forward
determinedly
to
next
sunday
when
chocolates
should
be
eaten
in
wild
profusion
in
the
watches
of
the
night
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
nervous
young
gruesome
stories
of
what
happened
to
people
wandering
casually
about
the
deeps
chapter
xiii
the
three
musketeers
miss
craigie
was
to
come
back
on
the
day
after
joey
was
restored
to
the
ordinary
privileges
of
blue
dorm
miss
conyngham
sent
for
joey
after
breakfast
and
mentioned
the
fact
asking
very
kindly
if
she
would
like
to
go
and
meet
the
four
train
instead
of
joining
her
form
croc
choose
a
companion
she
said
and
of
course
i
trust
you
to
go
and
come
back
by
the
road
jocelyn
joey
coloured
up
it
ever
so
good
of
you
miss
conyngham
of
course
i
play
fair
but
please
is
there
ever
a
time
when
you
could
let
us
go
on
the
deeps
for
that
tower
is
most
frightfully
interesting
the
owner
lives
in
london
i
believe
and
does
allow
people
to
go
over
it
miss
conyngham
said
it
is
supposed
to
be
very
safe
now
for
scrambling
about
in
but
i
will
try
to
find
out
if
he
would
have
any
objections
to
my
taking
a
party
of
you
girls
if
you
are
so
very
keen
i
think
it
would
do
that
nervous
chap
good
to
see
some
company
urged
joey
you
ca
think
what
his
jumpiness
was
like
miss
conyngham
miss
conyngham
was
as
usual
extremely
busy
and
could
not
wait
to
enter
into
the
question
which
companion
jocelyn
i
have
two
asked
joey
greatly
daring
miss
conyngham
considered
i
do
see
any
objection
if
you
will
all
behave
very
steadily
remember
the
credit
of
redlands
is
in
your
hands
whom
do
you
want
please
gabrielle
and
noreen
miss
conyngham
smiled
very
well
are
you
three
friends
joey
had
become
a
good
deal
more
certain
since
cousin
greta
asked
that
question
rather
miss
conyngham
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
gabrielle
is
a
very
good
sort
of
friend
to
have
jocelyn
and
noreen
is
a
frightfully
exciting
one
joey
explained
and
then
remembered
in
time
it
would
be
better
not
to
explain
why
she
discovered
that
she
had
gone
up
in
the
opinion
of
the
lower
school
now
that
miss
conyngham
had
actually
picked
her
out
to
meet
miss
craigie
the
mathematical
mistress
had
many
adorers
it
appeared
and
meeting
trains
could
only
be
done
by
very
special
permission
ingrid
latimer
herself
accosted
joey
in
the
interval
demanding
what
she
meant
by
going
i
suppose
miss
conyngham
thought
i
should
like
it
joey
said
slightly
flustered
by
the
question
from
one
so
great
as
the
senior
prefect
rubbish
as
though
the
head
would
stop
to
think
about
that
ingrid
answered
crushingly
think
again
kid
is
she
an
aunt
of
yours
by
any
chance
no
but
we
both
live
in
scotland
you
see
joey
suggested
the
cheek
of
the
babe
as
though
scotland
were
a
private
belonging
of
those
two
burst
in
another
huge
sixth
former
and
ingrid
suddenly
put
both
arms
round
joey
and
lifted
her
on
to
a
desk
now
there
you
stay
until
you
have
supplied
a
really
adequate
reason
why
you
merely
an
uppish
new
kid
should
be
granted
the
glorious
privilege
of
meeting
our
miss
craigie
joey
considered
want
the
real
reason
yes
and
hurry
up
with
it
joey
grinned
then
go
on
wanting
it
the
bell
for
third
lesson
rang
violently
oh
get
off
that
desk
and
go
to
your
classroom
ordered
ingrid
you
are
the
purple
limit
in
assertiveness
do
know
why
i
put
up
with
it
because
you
ca
help
it
suggested
joey
and
then
she
scuttled
past
ingrid
at
her
best
speed
and
joined
a
gasping
noreen
at
the
door
are
you
whole
and
entire
noreen
demanded
my
dear
joey
ingrid
will
strew
the
floor
with
your
remains
if
you
do
look
out
never
dare
speak
to
her
like
that
i
sooner
cheek
miss
conyngham
do
mind
ingrid
joey
boasted
it
rather
sport
to
see
what
she
say
next
no
talking
rapped
out
the
latin
master
and
noreen
began
to
gabble
over
her
work
to
herself
with
great
energy
joey
felt
fairly
sure
of
hers
so
devoted
the
spare
two
or
three
minutes
while
reade
surveyed
his
notes
to
drawing
an
extremely
fancy
portrait
of
herself
and
ingrid
walking
down
the
queen
hall
arm
in
arm
while
portions
of
the
lower
school
cowered
in
doorways
or
hurried
obsequiously
to
right
and
left
this
work
of
art
was
duly
shown
to
noreen
as
soon
as
a
flustered
barbara
was
put
on
to
construe
noreen
retorted
with
a
furious
just
you
wait
joey
assertiveness
was
kindly
ignored
in
the
afternoon
however
in
view
of
the
fact
that
she
had
won
the
privilege
of
meeting
the
train
for
her
friends
and
the
three
set
out
very
cheerfully
and
a
good
ten
minutes
earlier
than
they
need
have
done
how
the
professor
joey
asked
as
they
passed
the
lab
where
she
had
spent
those
purgatorial
minutes
on
her
first
arrival
it
had
been
arranged
by
miss
conyngham
that
she
should
not
take
chemistry
till
next
term
in
view
of
the
host
of
bewildering
new
subjects
that
descend
upon
a
girl
fresh
to
school
noreen
screwed
up
her
eyes
well
his
temper
is
on
the
mend
if
he
goes
on
being
such
a
beast
i
shall
cook
up
a
pathetic
letter
to
the
pater
and
tell
him
i
overworked
i
should
think
is
suggested
gabrielle
quietly
have
you
noticed
how
pouchy
he
is
under
the
eyes
as
though
he
did
get
enough
sleep
well
whatever
is
the
matter
with
him
he
a
holy
terror
to
work
with
noreen
declared
unsympathetically
i
say
gabrielle
i
wish
joey
did
take
stinks
her
uppishness
would
probably
drive
him
clean
over
the
border
and
we
should
have
to
bear
with
him
any
more
you
jolly
well
got
to
be
uppish
here
if
you
do
want
to
be
absolutely
squashed
joey
explained
i
expect
the
professor
has
there
was
an
english
lady
came
to
stay
with
us
who
simply
could
stand
bingo
blowing
a
trumpet
anywhere
near
her
because
she
had
that
poor
thing
he
has
a
bad
conscience
and
is
doing
something
beastly
with
his
stinks
suggested
noreen
i
say
would
it
be
a
good
thing
to
find
out
which
it
is
if
it
well
i
bear
his
utter
hatefulness
and
calling
me
before
the
class
with
cheerfulness
though
i
sure
he
too
old
and
too
stout
to
have
fought
the
huns
still
he
have
done
munitions
and
used
his
chemistry
that
way
was
he
here
in
the
war
asked
joey
rather
not
he
only
came
last
term
and
nobody
could
stand
him
then
he
worse
now
so
if
it
an
evil
conscience
i
say
joey
you
old
slacker
why
do
you
take
stinks
you
could
help
no
end
in
the
sherlock
holmes
business
tell
you
what
i
smuggle
you
in
next
time
cicely
wren
is
in
san
with
a
throat
he
wo
notice
who
there
as
long
as
he
has
his
proper
tale
of
jumpy
victims
let
joey
said
but
much
to
her
surprise
and
disappointment
gabrielle
interfered
quite
decidedly
no
that
would
do
you
must
joey
do
try
and
get
her
to
noreen
do
see
why
not
grumbled
noreen
but
joey
noticed
that
she
yielded
to
the
rather
small
head
of
the
lower
school
with
only
that
one
murmur
it
was
a
dull
lowering
afternoon
and
the
round
tower
standing
up
before
the
three
looked
gloomy
and
forbidding
wonder
if
the
jumpy
young
man
is
there
now
joey
remarked
the
whole
story
of
her
adventure
had
been
joyfully
told
last
night
in
blue
dorm
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
most
unwise
amount
of
chocolates
and
all
blue
dorm
was
as
keen
to
explore
the
shaky
tower
as
she
was
herself
and
she
and
gabrielle
had
shared
a
milk
tumbler
at
break
after
which
gabrielle
had
been
quite
as
much
stirred
up
as
the
other
three
were
it
strikes
me
said
noreen
that
we
are
living
in
a
mystery
probably
lurid
and
certainly
topping
why
should
joey
man
be
so
jumpy
she
paused
dramatically
an
bomb
fell
near
him
suggested
joey
egg
a
bomb
took
most
of
my
granny
wall
out
one
night
and
she
did
turn
a
hair
english
people
do
he
belgian
he
did
seem
quite
english
somehow
well
if
you
meet
him
casually
drop
into
french
and
see
how
he
takes
it
drop
into
french
yourself
urged
joey
you
always
find
that
so
jolly
easy
in
french
conversation
class
there
listen
to
her
gabrielle
ever
know
anything
so
cheeky
and
i
nearly
a
year
older
complained
noreen
gabrielle
was
a
peacemaker
oh
do
rag
you
two
i
want
to
think
about
the
professor
i
wonder
whether
miss
conyngham
knows
quite
how
how
cranky
he
is
he
quite
frightened
a
lot
of
the
babies
who
were
playing
about
near
the
door
of
the
lab
the
other
day
rosie
told
me
he
simply
yelled
at
them
and
no
one
ought
to
do
that
with
babies
it
was
as
though
they
were
trying
to
go
in
or
anything
of
that
sort
i
believe
it
an
evil
conscience
he
got
urged
noreen
with
relish
why
should
he
go
for
the
babies
otherwise
there
no
sense
in
it
unless
it
like
our
visitor
and
bingo
trumpet
joey
said
but
she
did
go
for
him
she
only
asked
frightfully
nicely
if
he
would
mind
blowing
it
farther
off
the
professor
a
pig
to
the
kids
i
noticed
it
do
you
know
tiddles
will
never
play
that
side
of
the
house
at
all
he
has
gone
and
frightened
poor
little
tiddles
has
he
demanded
gabrielle
indignantly
i
do
know
i
never
asked
but
she
ca
bear
him
joey
said
she
wo
come
round
that
way
even
with
me
gabrielle
ruffled
up
like
an
angry
robin
well
that
settles
it
of
course
one
ca
go
sneaking
of
him
to
miss
conyngham
when
it
may
be
but
i
shall
ask
the
professor
myself
if
he
will
mind
being
careful
where
the
babies
are
concerned
poor
little
things
noreen
and
joey
gasped
you
wo
why
he
be
furious
it
my
job
to
look
after
things
like
that
gabrielle
said
firmly
it
the
choice
between
pointing
out
quietly
to
him
that
babies
must
be
frightened
and
telling
miss
conyngham
what
he
been
doing
and
i
head
of
the
lower
and
nobody
tells
about
unfairness
and
things
like
that
at
coll
you
just
bear
them
or
alter
them
for
yourself
well
you
a
sport
gabrielle
noreen
remarked
admiringly
would
have
the
pluck
of
course
i
shall
put
it
quite
politely
gabrielle
told
them
just
say
i
am
sure
he
would
be
most
disturbed
if
he
knew
that
he
frightened
the
babies
and
so
on
i
do
suppose
he
does
it
on
purpose
i
do
noreen
said
stubbornly
do
you
joey
have
seen
enough
of
him
but
i
do
think
he
a
terror
joey
agreed
and
then
the
station
came
in
sight
and
they
left
off
talking
about
the
professor
and
his
ways
and
talked
of
miss
craigie
instead
you
have
to
buck
up
over
your
maths
now
joey
gabrielle
remarked
she
be
so
frightfully
keen
to
see
you
go
top
if
she
a
friend
of
yours
joey
is
rather
brainy
over
them
noreen
remarked
kindly
i
sometimes
fear
she
going
to
turn
into
a
swot
after
all
i
not
i
been
in
quite
as
many
rows
for
talking
in
maths
class
as
you
anyhow
joey
retorted
well
nobody
talks
when
miss
craigie
takes
maths
gabrielle
said
and
noreen
agreed
a
trifle
ruefully
no
that
a
true
bill
a
frightfully
strenuous
crowd
in
scotland
joey
glad
i
was
born
there
it
really
rather
funny
we
three
should
be
friends
joey
remarked
gabrielle
english
noreen
irish
and
i
scotch
we
ought
to
make
a
pretty
good
alliance
do
you
think
said
gabrielle
in
her
quiet
way
the
three
musketeers
suggested
noreen
let
stick
together
like
they
did
and
i
only
wish
we
could
go
in
for
as
many
rows
at
which
pious
aspiration
both
joey
and
gabrielle
laughed
for
noreen
was
notorious
at
redlands
for
the
number
and
extent
of
her
rows
the
train
was
rather
late
but
it
came
at
last
and
among
the
few
people
getting
out
at
mote
deeping
was
a
neat
figure
in
a
very
coat
and
skirt
who
was
only
about
half
craigie
ungainly
size
and
not
at
all
like
him
at
first
sight
though
joey
came
a
little
later
on
to
recognise
the
familiar
twinkle
of
the
eyes
and
the
kindly
smile
just
then
she
only
knew
miss
craigie
by
the
ecstatic
exclamation
of
noreen
and
gabrielle
that
her
miss
craigie
shook
hands
with
them
and
she
seemed
to
know
who
joey
was
without
a
need
of
gabrielle
polite
introduction
at
the
earnest
request
of
all
the
three
she
consented
to
put
all
her
luggage
into
one
of
the
wheezy
cabs
and
walk
with
them
to
redlands
she
laid
a
hand
on
joey
shoulder
as
they
left
the
little
station
well
how
goes
it
joey
liked
her
voice
with
its
touch
of
soft
scotch
accent
and
her
eyes
were
very
kind
she
took
a
deep
breath
i
messed
up
my
quilt
taking
it
on
the
roof
and
matron
says
a
disgrace
and
ought
to
make
me
ashamed
every
time
i
go
to
bed
and
i
starred
a
window
so
it
had
to
be
mended
and
i
got
into
a
row
with
the
head
for
arriving
home
alone
and
with
professor
trouville
for
tidying
his
old
lab
that
was
my
fault
interrupted
noreen
and
been
turned
out
of
french
class
once
but
maddy
was
fearfully
decent
after
and
out
of
maths
class
twice
for
ragging
i
begin
to
feel
quite
anxious
miss
craigie
said
tranquilly
but
even
joey
understood
the
truth
of
noreen
statement
that
there
was
no
ragging
when
miss
craigie
taught
with
noreen
squeezing
her
arm
affectionately
on
one
side
and
joey
holding
rather
shyly
to
the
other
miss
craigie
walked
the
two
miles
to
redlands
hearing
much
school
news
and
asking
many
questions
in
especial
about
the
prospects
of
the
big
hockey
match
redlands
lincolnshire
ladies
which
was
always
played
towards
the
end
of
october
it
to
be
at
deeping
royal
this
year
gabrielle
said
it
was
the
lincs
ladies
turn
to
choose
you
see
selfish
pigs
they
might
have
chosen
somewhere
nearer
nine
miles
off
why
hardly
any
of
us
will
be
able
to
go
and
look
on
grumbled
noreen
i
think
you
will
find
that
a
certain
number
will
go
by
train
miss
craigie
said
in
her
quiet
way
you
ought
to
be
a
poet
noreen
you
do
love
to
magnify
a
grievance
noreen
joined
in
the
laugh
against
herself
she
was
always
ready
to
do
that
well
i
do
magnify
the
stinks
professor
anyway
miss
craigie
he
has
grown
into
such
an
beast
has
he
gabby
miss
craigie
shook
her
head
unparliamentary
language
noreen
stop
it
please
noreen
stopped
quite
meekly
rather
to
joey
disappointment
she
would
have
liked
to
consult
miss
craigie
about
the
professor
and
his
ways
however
if
he
was
to
be
talked
about
there
was
an
end
of
it
she
asked
instead
where
deeping
royal
was
away
beyond
the
big
reservoir
much
nearer
the
fossdyke
wash
than
we
are
noreen
explained
gorgeous
fields
if
it
fine
but
when
wet
help
i
wish
they
would
play
us
at
redlands
we
always
all
right
and
who
will
be
allowed
to
go
besides
the
team
joey
next
asked
anxiously
oh
when
we
play
outside
and
have
to
drive
or
go
by
train
each
member
of
the
team
can
take
a
friend
and
the
heads
of
the
upper
and
lower
school
can
take
two
you
take
us
wo
you
gabrielle
noreen
demanded
breathlessly
joey
gasped
at
the
audacity
of
this
suggestion
but
gabrielle
answered
composedly
you
were
the
two
i
meant
to
ask
joey
walked
the
rest
of
the
way
back
treading
on
air
and
refrained
from
swanking
aggressively
to
either
gabrielle
or
noreen
when
miss
craigie
invited
her
to
come
and
help
unpack
after
tea
afterwards
when
several
very
big
things
had
happened
she
looked
back
on
that
blissful
afternoon
and
saw
the
result
of
that
threefold
friendship
chapter
xiv
the
play
the
thing
think
we
ought
to
do
something
to
celebrate
miss
return
remarked
noreen
they
were
dressing
for
supper
in
blue
dorm
joey
barbara
syb
and
noreen
and
as
usual
they
were
dressing
in
a
hurry
what
sort
of
thing
joey
demanded
trying
to
disentangle
hooks
from
her
hair
something
to
show
we
jolly
pleased
she
come
back
just
think
she
might
have
died
of
that
loathly
lots
of
people
have
shut
it
you
old
ghoul
ordered
barbara
she
all
right
again
now
thank
goodness
and
we
ought
to
celebrate
her
noreen
said
triumphantly
violets
suggested
joey
silly
cuckoo
how
are
we
to
get
them
what
you
want
noreen
syb
asked
impatiently
how
about
charades
after
supper
and
ask
her
to
come
and
see
them
frightfully
short
time
to
think
of
anything
decent
objected
syb
besides
miss
craigie
wo
want
to
leave
her
dear
miss
lambton
you
bet
let
ask
her
too
that
does
give
us
a
decent
charade
ca
we
think
of
something
not
something
good
enough
you
like
to
do
some
scenes
from
if
you
want
to
be
so
very
noreen
suggested
scornfully
remove
ii
b
were
taking
in
literature
and
noreen
and
the
literature
mistress
were
usually
at
loggerheads
it
was
that
suggestion
which
gave
joey
her
idea
i
say
she
burst
out
why
should
we
do
a
charade
on
the
lines
of
you
know
where
the
poison
was
poured
into
the
poor
chap
ear
and
ask
all
the
staff
to
come
and
see
whether
the
professor
looks
guilty
and
shrieks
because
he
doing
something
evil
with
his
stinks
as
noreen
says
or
just
has
a
appearance
it
need
be
a
noisy
charade
to
upset
him
if
it
just
strain
noreen
thumped
joey
on
the
back
topping
plan
what
word
shall
we
have
german
suggested
joey
the
first
syllable
could
be
germ
you
know
those
things
matron
is
always
fussing
about
or
the
huns
putting
them
into
wells
barbara
interrupted
in
great
excitement
what
about
asked
syb
could
she
be
a
german
girl
called
anne
anna
really
who
is
pretending
to
be
a
schoolgirl
and
really
plotting
and
spying
joey
said
my
word
joey
you
coming
on
i
less
surprised
you
got
the
scholarship
noreen
cried
we
gabrielle
and
joey
and
i
settled
this
afternoon
that
someone
ought
to
look
into
the
matter
of
the
hatefulness
and
it
us
that
are
going
to
she
added
cheerfully
and
ungrammatically
for
the
benefit
of
syb
and
barbara
if
he
all
right
our
charade
wo
hurt
him
he
like
it
if
he
not
the
gong
sounded
soufflez
regardez
glissant
mes
enfants
noreen
cried
tying
her
with
desperate
speed
we
must
fix
up
our
charade
after
supper
and
look
here
we
must
get
some
of
the
others
to
perform
first
while
we
fixing
it
ingrid
might
recite
she
awfully
good
and
we
get
gabrielle
to
fiddle
joey
you
better
do
the
asking
miss
craigie
oh
and
of
course
you
have
to
go
to
the
head
first
as
we
want
all
the
staff
point
out
it
an
occasion
oh
i
say
wo
one
of
you
asked
poor
joey
but
noreen
was
adamant
you
rather
in
favour
with
the
head
i
believe
and
anyhow
swanked
enough
about
miss
craigie
it
clearly
your
duty
to
get
leave
for
the
show
we
do
the
rest
all
right
joey
agreed
resignedly
and
then
the
inhabitants
of
blue
dorm
tore
downstairs
at
a
record
pace
only
just
escaping
an
order
mark
for
lateness
by
the
skin
of
their
teeth
miss
conyngham
received
joey
request
very
graciously
and
promised
to
invite
the
staff
to
witness
the
performance
and
bring
them
with
her
to
queen
hall
in
half
an
hour
time
joey
flew
back
very
satisfied
to
find
noreen
barbara
and
sybil
in
one
of
the
small
classrooms
opening
from
the
hall
distractedly
considering
the
charade
but
they
were
cheerful
too
for
it
appeared
that
ingrid
had
consented
to
recite
and
gabrielle
and
the
musical
genius
of
remove
clare
estcome
to
play
we
put
the
play
last
noreen
said
impressively
and
we
four
will
do
it
and
say
nothing
to
anybody
else
joey
just
tell
some
of
these
juniors
who
are
doing
nothing
to
arrange
the
chairs
for
a
show
and
pull
the
curtains
across
the
platform
and
then
we
can
get
on
to
our
job
you
sure
the
professor
is
coming
miss
conyngham
laughed
frightfully
nicely
and
said
she
was
sure
all
the
staff
would
be
delighted
and
she
thought
it
a
topping
idea
joey
said
and
on
that
the
four
got
to
work
in
earnest
miss
conyngham
gave
gracious
permission
for
the
two
forms
below
remove
ii
to
sit
up
for
the
performance
so
a
large
audience
was
already
assembled
when
the
staff
of
redlands
swept
into
the
queen
hall
miss
conyngham
with
her
arm
through
miss
craigie
to
place
themselves
in
the
stalls
specially
retained
for
them
joey
watching
through
a
chink
in
the
curtains
shutting
off
the
platform
was
delighted
to
see
that
the
professor
sat
upon
the
other
side
of
miss
conyngham
he
looked
placid
and
pleased
enough
now
so
far
as
his
large
pallid
face
could
be
said
to
show
any
expression
at
all
the
audience
was
further
swelled
by
the
servants
indoor
and
out
even
including
two
or
three
men
who
were
repairing
pipes
the
performance
began
with
gabrielle
newest
a
nocturne
executed
very
correctly
but
rather
nervously
the
school
applauded
vigorously
as
they
would
have
applauded
anything
from
the
popular
heads
of
the
upper
or
lower
school
ingrid
followed
jarringly
dramatic
in
noyes
and
was
violently
appreciated
clare
not
having
to
face
her
audience
the
piano
being
sideways
to
the
stage
gave
the
most
successful
performance
of
the
three
but
took
a
strictly
secondary
place
in
the
way
of
applause
then
after
some
whispering
and
stifled
giggling
joey
was
pushed
forward
to
the
front
of
the
stage
and
the
curtain
drawn
back
a
chink
she
spoke
through
it
i
have
to
announce
that
the
forthcoming
charade
is
in
two
syllables
and
three
scenes
the
third
is
the
complete
word
she
withdrew
and
all
the
juniors
started
thinking
aloud
of
words
they
were
quite
audible
on
the
stage
where
barbara
spectacled
and
padded
as
to
body
was
bending
over
a
steaming
prodding
it
nervously
i
thought
if
you
germs
you
killed
them
she
whispered
this
seems
so
jolly
like
the
witches
in
go
on
you
silly
ass
urged
noreen
it
looks
all
right
anyhow
and
you
got
the
for
growing
the
germs
on
come
on
joey
i
must
tie
you
up
joey
attired
in
a
plaid
frock
belonging
to
one
of
the
little
ones
to
represent
a
kilt
a
khaki
sports
coat
buttoned
across
and
two
box
straps
for
a
belt
was
forthwith
lashed
brutally
to
a
curtain
pole
and
ordered
not
to
so
much
as
breathe
for
fear
she
should
move
it
and
it
should
become
plain
to
the
audience
that
it
was
leaning
against
her
and
she
could
have
walked
off
with
it
quite
easily
syb
also
rather
sketchy
as
to
uniform
but
with
an
unmistakable
german
cap
to
make
her
nationality
clear
stood
by
with
a
bayonet
of
stupendous
size
noreen
pillowy
as
to
figure
and
checked
as
to
blouse
and
with
her
curly
dark
hair
tightly
strained
off
her
forehead
hovered
near
the
professor
with
a
large
wooden
spoon
whether
to
stir
soup
or
germs
seemed
doubtful
she
waved
this
spoon
impressively
and
sent
a
thrilling
whisper
to
the
side
of
draw
the
curtains
the
curtains
jerked
back
and
after
a
pause
to
allow
of
sufficient
thrill
upon
the
part
of
the
audience
noreen
inquired
sepulchrally
mein
fater
the
mixture
slab
and
strong
as
strong
as
thy
soup
on
sundays
my
daughter
was
the
reply
as
strong
as
the
accursed
british
army
thinks
it
is
and
proves
it
is
remarked
the
dauntless
captive
at
the
curtain
pole
and
was
promptly
prodded
with
the
bayonet
to
induce
a
respectful
silence
illustration
mein
fater
is
the
mixture
slab
and
strong
the
professor
in
very
good
english
with
an
occasional
lapse
into
a
german
word
and
a
masterly
repetition
of
tod
und
teufel
at
regular
intervals
proceeded
to
explain
to
his
intelligent
daughter
who
stirred
soup
over
a
stove
at
the
back
of
the
stage
between
times
to
add
realism
that
he
was
engaged
in
growing
germs
of
a
horrible
disease
which
was
to
go
as
far
as
possible
towards
exterminating
the
accursed
englanders
and
that
when
he
had
so
to
speak
bottled
them
she
was
to
take
them
to
england
and
cast
them
into
all
receptacles
of
drinking
water
throughout
the
kingdom
to
avert
suspicion
she
was
to
let
her
hair
down
attire
herself
in
a
djibbah
and
assume
the
character
of
an
english
schoolgirl
the
fair
anna
delightedly
accepted
the
commission
and
retired
from
the
stage
to
change
the
checked
blouse
and
the
professor
ladled
out
presumably
spoonfuls
of
germ
on
to
the
photographic
slides
while
informing
the
english
prisoner
that
his
accursed
race
would
soon
be
the
englishman
returning
an
undaunted
reply
was
again
prodded
violently
and
anna
returning
in
a
djibbah
and
looking
marvellously
thinner
passed
him
with
the
taunting
gibe
that
she
would
pass
anywhere
as
an
english
girl
and
he
was
powerless
to
save
his
country
and
marched
out
for
england
carrying
a
dispatch
case
full
of
bottled
germs
the
professor
and
the
guard
thereupon
sat
down
to
drink
confusion
to
perfidious
england
which
they
did
with
great
gusto
and
succumbed
to
the
force
of
brandy
neat
they
stated
it
was
that
with
much
speed
as
soon
as
they
had
their
heads
down
on
a
table
which
shook
with
their
snores
the
english
prisoner
set
to
work
to
free
himself
and
succeeded
in
doing
so
just
as
the
curtains
were
drawn
in
obedience
to
frenzied
whispers
from
noreen
from
behind
joey
laid
down
her
curtain
pole
and
flew
to
the
chink
regardless
of
the
flattering
applause
that
was
greeting
the
first
scene
of
this
thrilling
drama
what
is
the
professor
looking
like
noreen
he
clapping
quite
a
lot
noreen
explained
in
a
gusty
whisper
and
joey
peering
over
her
shoulder
at
the
large
pallid
face
and
the
black
moustache
saw
that
noreen
was
quite
right
the
professor
was
clapping
as
vigorously
as
miss
craigie
herself
it
must
be
said
joey
and
they
rang
up
the
curtain
on
scene
which
showed
anna
or
anne
in
her
dormitory
at
a
school
which
appeared
to
consist
in
one
other
girl
only
and
a
superannuated
mistress
syb
whose
aggressive
spectacles
did
not
seem
much
to
assist
her
defective
sight
she
tottered
up
to
say
to
her
pupils
calling
barbara
out
with
her
to
unhook
her
dress
which
opportunity
was
seized
upon
by
anna
to
mention
in
a
brief
soliloquy
that
she
was
only
waiting
till
her
was
asleep
to
steal
out
and
introduce
her
father
germs
alternately
alluded
to
as
and
bubonic
plague
into
the
neighbouring
reservoir
this
proceeding
being
the
prelude
to
the
abrupt
departure
of
anne
from
the
english
for
good
barbara
returned
on
the
enunciation
of
this
sentiment
and
after
a
brief
conversation
with
the
obviously
unsympathetic
anne
about
her
brother
a
prisoner
in
germany
the
two
girls
lay
down
in
their
upon
a
sofa
that
was
rather
a
tight
fit
for
one
and
fell
instantly
into
sound
stage
slumber
after
a
thrilling
moment
of
silence
anne
rose
up
lit
a
candle
held
it
close
to
the
eyes
of
the
slumbering
barbara
and
remarking
she
sleeps
the
english
ach

now
can
i
do
what
i
will
she
seized
the
horlick
malted
milk
bottle
large
size
which
contained
the
germs
and
stole
out
she
had
hardly
closed
the
door
when
barbara
sat
up
crying
am
i
dreaming
or
did
she
say
if
so
she
is
no
english
anne
but
a
german
spy
among
us
and
what
has
she
gone
to
do
the
question
was
answered
by
a
call
from
beneath
the
window
at
the
back
of
the
stage
and
barbara
dashing
to
it
called
jock
it
never
you
come
up
i
alone
joey
hoisted
from
below
by
ingrid
appeared
at
the
open
window
with
triumph
of
realism
her
hair
and
clothes
wet
for
it
was
raining
struggled
through
with
much
display
of
thin
legs
and
said
dramatically
has
she
loosed
her
bugs
the
explanation
that
followed
was
a
triumph
of
brevity
and
brother
and
sister
dashed
out
to
try
and
cut
anne
off
before
she
reached
the
reservoir
the
curtain
fell
amid
tumultuous
applause
and
a
jovial
request
from
professor
trouville
that
they
would
be
vary
careful
not
to
drop
the
bottle
and
let
zose
fierce
animals
loose
upon
us
the
third
scene
required
no
preparation
and
was
brief
indeed
the
aged
head
mistress
discovered
asking
frantically
of
no
one
in
particular
what
can
have
happened
to
her
pupils
to
her
enter

and
barbara
dragging
between
them
anne
defiant
and
with
the
germ
bottle
torn
from
her
hand
unopened
the
highland
officer
explained
the
situation
in
two
sentences
and
anne
in
a
superior
german
accent
mentioned
that
from
her
point
of
view
to
torture
prisoners
and
let
loose
disease
upon
women
and
children
were
right
and
proper

the

down

a
stately
compliment
to
the
acting

felt
a
touch
on
her
arm
and
turning
found
herself
face
to

with
the
professor
he
was
smiling
quite
pleasantly
a
clefare
and
entertaining
little
play

he
said
and
it
is
you
that

congratulations
oh
thanks
awfully
but
it
was
me
really
we
all
four
did
it

began
in
some
confusion
when
noreen
caught
what
she
said
and
interrupted
do
listen
to
her
professor
trouville
she
planned
it
really
and
it
was
jolly
brainy
of
her
was
it
the
professor
smiled
his
curious
smile
i
thank
you
mees
noreen
i
thought
that
i
congratulate
the
right
one
but
your
friend
of
the
scholarship
is
modest
ce
really
the
old
chap
was
quite
human
for
once
was

noreen
remarked
as
the
four
went
up
to
blue
dorm
a
few
minutes
later
i
hope
gabrielle
went
for
him
about
the
babes
while
he
was
in
this
yielding
mood
she
wo
get
her
nose
snapped
off
quite
so
close
to
her
face
but
joey
did
answer
she
was
wondering
why
it
was
that
she
had
found
the
professor
pleasantness
so
singularly
unpleasant
chapter

the
joey
could
go
to
sleep
that
night
she
was
excited
and
all
kinds
of
thoughts
went
whirling
round
and
round
in
her
head
making
sleep
impossible
the
whole
day
had
been
exciting
the
play
had
only
been
the
culmination
of
it
all
the
walk
to
the
station
the
conversation
about
professor
trouville
and
his
queerness
on
top
of
that
the
thrill
of
being
coupled
with
noreen
in
gabrielle
invitation
to
the
great
match
the
long
talk
about
with
miss
craigie
in
her
bedroom
and
then
the
play
it
was
this
last
probably
that
turned
her
thoughts
so
much
to
father
dying
far
away
from
them
all
among
his
enemies
the
man
who
had
been
father
special
friend
among
the
prisoners
had
come
to
see
mums
when
the
armistice
released
those
of
our
men
who
had
survived
the
german
treatment
and
had
told
her
that
father
was
taken
from
the
prison
camp
in
a
dying
state
and
word
had
come
back
a
few
days
later
that
he
was
dead
captain
verney
had
done
his
very
best
delaying
his
own
return
to
find
out
for
mums
just
how
he
died
and
where
he
had
been
buried
but
it
seemed
that
no
one
knew
or
cared
and
uncle
staff
had
had
no
better
luck
when
he
went
out
with
a
permit
to
investigate
a
few
weeks
later
mums
and
the
children
had
just
the
one
consolation
of
knowing
that
father
died
for
england
just
as
surely
as
though
he
had
been
shot
going
over
the
top
to
help
them
bear
the
thought
of
the
long
weeks
of
suffering
and
which
had
come
first
if
only
escaping
from
prison
were
as
easy
as
it
seemed
in
books
and
plays
joey
thought
tossing
restlessly
she
and
gavin
would
have
been
out
in
germany
with
a
file
and
a
bottle
of
chloroform
and
have
set
father
free
before
the
huns
had
time
to
kill
him
but
in
real
life
you
could
do
nothing
except
wait
and
wait
and
say
your
prayers
and
take
care
of
mums
joey
sat
up
in
bed
and
stared
out
at
the
dark
so
close
to
her
it
was
a
mild
damp
night
she
threw
off
her
quilt
perhaps
she
was
too
hot
and
that
was
the
reason
that
she
could
not
sleep
and
while
she
was
sitting
up
she
saw
something
flash
in
the
darkness
and
knew
in
a
second
what
it
was
a
series
of
short
blue
flashes
coming
from
the
dark
how
funny
was
her
first
thought
and
then
she
suddenly
called
to
mind
john
signalling
instructions
that
was
the
in
morse
somebody
it
seemed
was
going
to
practise
his
signalling
now
at
nearly
twelve
at
night
joey
crept
out
of
bed
and
crouched
on
the
so
as
to
miss
nothing
there
was
disappointingly
little
to
see
the
people
whoever
they
were
were
not
nearly
such
keen
signallers
as
john
was
something
came
from
the
side
of
the
house
from
her
window
joey
could
locate
it
exactly
three
long
flashes
and
two
short
ones
then
a
minute
later
from
the
distance
one
of
the
letters
she
had
used
with
john
short
long
long
long
and
then
a
and
that
was
all
joey
sat
crouched
on
the
for
quite
a
long
time
but
nothing
more
happened
then
just
as
she
was
thinking
of
getting
back
to
bed
someone
came
round
the
corner
of
the
house
far
below
it
was
the
professor
she
saw
him
unmistakably
in
the
light
of
an
electric
torch
which
he
must
have
pressed
for
an
instant
perhaps
to
show
him
the
path
he
slept
as
joey
knew
in
a
room
on
the
ground
floor
of
the
lodge
he
had
chosen
it
because
he
so
often
worked
late
at
the
lab
and
did
not
want
to
disturb
the
and
his
wife
she
wondered
whether
it
was
he
who
had
been
signalling
somehow
you
would
not
expect
an
chemistry
professor
to
want
to
practise
signalling
especially
about
twelve
at
night
of
course
german
spies
used
to
signal
in
wartime
but
then
the
professor
was
german
his
name
was
french
and
the
look
of
him
was
more
french
than
german
and
he
spoke
with
a
french
accent
and
most
important
proof
of
all
he
had
laughed
and
been
quite
genial
about
the
play
instead
of
giving
himself
away
as
hamlet
uncle
had
done
besides
english
people
had
settled
they
would
have
huns
creeping
in
among
them
again
and
though
colonel
sturt
had
seemed
to
think
they
might
be
doing
it
cousin
greta
had
not
agreed
with
him
joey
set
to
work
to
see
if
she
could
remember
the
signalling
if
the
professor
were
really
keen
on
it
and
went
on
being
in
the
pleasant
temper
he
had
shown
perhaps
she
might
ask
him
some
questions
dash
dash
dash
dot
dot
she
went
through
the
alphabet
there
were
no
letters
like
that
then
it
must
be
a
numeral
john
had
taught
those
as
well
the
long
numerals
were
the
ones
he
had
insisted
on
because
he
thought
it
made
things
so
slow
to
have
to
signal
f
i
before
you
sent
a
numeral
dot
dot
dot
dash
dash
joey
had
it
it
was
three
and
immediately
after
it
a
pause
between
dot
dash
dash
dash
dash
that
had
been
all
the
other
signal
had
been
an
answer
and
that
was
a
good
deal
more
puzzling
for
surely
dot
dash
dash
dash
stood
for
j
and
for
a
and
yet
ja
had
no
sense
joey
supposed
she
must
have
forgotten
the
alphabet
and
went
to
sleep
at
last
trying
to
remember
the
play
influenced
her
dreams
more
strongly
than
the
signalling
it
acted
itself
again
through
her
sleep
only
it
refused
to
act
itself
straightforwardly
everything
and
everyone
seemed
to
stick
and
repeat
including
noreen
so
ready
of
tongue
her
german
which
joey
who
had
never
learnt
any
had
so
admired
last
night
had
quite
deserted
her
the
only
word
she
seemed
able
to
make
use
of
was
no
tod
und
teufels
no
ach
himmels
she
said
ja
ja
and
that
was
all
and
then
the
sounded
and
clara
the
housemaid
came
in
with
a
clatter
of
cans
and
it
was
morning
joey
was
sleepy
and
did
not
get
up
till
the
last
possible
minute
and
then
it
meant
a
frantic
scramble
to
get
dressed
in
time
and
no
chance
of
talking
to
the
others
as
it
was
she
was
just
a
moment
late
but
grace
had
not
yet
been
said
for
the
girls
were
still
standing
round
the
tables
so
she
hoped
to
escape
the
order
mark
which
was
her
due
she
slid
noiselessly
into
her
place
and
then
became
aware
that
miss
conyngham
was
speaking
miss
conyngham
who
never
appeared
at
breakfast
but
had
it
in
a
stately
manner
befitting
head
mistresses
in
her
own
room
she
was
standing
at
the
top
of
the
long
centre
table
where
ingrid
and
other
great
seniors
sat
and
there
was
a
little
line
drawn
between
her
eyebrows
as
though
she
were
worried
she
was
evidently
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
joey
listened
trying
to
make
out
what
it
was
all
about
and
when
professor
trouville
went
to
the
lab
before
breakfast
this
morning
somebody
had
been
there
breaking
bottles
mixing
specimens
and
doing
other
acts
of
altogether
stupid
and
unreasonable
mischief
the
door
was
as
usual
locked
the
girl
whoever
she
was
had
got
in
at
the
window
by
the
steps
which
professor
trouville
had
for
once
left
open
that
being
so
i
quite
exonerate
the
juniors
no
girl
under
thirteen
could
scramble
up
to
that
window
professor
trouville
tells
me
that
he
has
had
trouble
with
several
of
the
girls
in
remove
ii
b
if
any
girl
there
has
done
this
wrong
and
foolish
thing
it
is
up
to
her
to
own
it
now
for
the
honour
of
a
school
which
does
not
turn
out
cowards
there
was
a
thrilling
pause
while
miss
conyngham
eyes
looked
round
expectantly
and
the
professor
stood
just
behind
her
silent
watchful
impassive
with
lids
miss
conyngham
seemed
to
have
no
doubt
that
somebody
was
going
to
speak
a
little
of
the
colour
faded
from
her
face
and
the
light
from
her
eyes
when
there
came
only
silence
i
trust
the
girl
who
has
done
this
thing
to
tell
us
now
she
said
and
still
there
was
silence
miss
conyngham
face
grew
a
little
stern
if
any
girl
here
knows
anything
of
the
matter
though
not
herself
responsible
i
wish
her
to
speak
out
still
silence
the
professor
whispered
something
to
miss
conyngham
she
shook
her
head
then
spoke
to
the
senior
mistress
present
breakfast
had
better
go
on
now
miss
wrestow
i
will
deal
with
this
matter
later
she
went
out
followed
by
the
professor
what
on
earth
is
the
matter
joey
whispered
squeezing
hastily
into
a
place
by
noreen
something
happened
to
the
lab
what
luck
for
you
stinks
people
you
wo
be
able
to
do
any
noreen
was
rather
cross
do
be
such
a
young
silly
do
you
see
this
is
going
to
be
a
horrid
plague
for
us
that
old
beast
has
put
the
head
on
to
remove
ii
b
just
because
he
does
like
me
i
believe
and
of
course
we
suspected
you
heard
what
miss
conyngham
said
but
who
done
what
somebody
got
in
and
smashed
some
of
his
hateful
old
things
there
should
think
the
cat
as
likely
as
not
but
of
course
he
fastens
it
on
to
us
just
like
him
as
if
i
go
and
do
a
silly
kid
trick
like
that
of
course
you
would
it
a
shame
comforted
joey
but
of
course
the
head
would
never
think
so
she
just
had
to
ask
when
does
he
think
we
did
it
last
night
he
thought
we
were
excited
about
the
play
and
aiming
it
at
him
and
somebody
went
in
and
did
it
after
we
were
supposed
to
be
in
bed
but
he
was
there
himself
much
later
than
that
almost
shouted
joey
i
saw
him
out
of
my
window
well
he
the
limit
then
let
tell
gabby
that
the
information
was
passed
up
to
gabrielle
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
she
came
round
to
the
other
two
the
minute
breakfast
was
over
what
this
joey
joey
began
upon
the
story
of
last
night
but
had
got
far
in
it
before
ingrid
latimer
bore
down
upon
the
group
joey
graham
where
are
you
you
are
to
go
to
miss
conyngham
at
once
she
told
me
so
before
she
went
oh
bother
just
when
you
were
telling
us
noreen
broke
out
cut
along
and
do
hurry
i
shall
burst
if
i
do
know
the
rest
before
first
lesson
joey
ran
arriving
at
miss
conyngham
door
in
a
decidedly
breathless
condition
miss
conyngham
was
there
with
the
professor
he
was
speaking
but
stopped
as
joey
came
in
joey
had
an
idea
that
behind
his
pale
impassive
face
he
was
very
angry
jocelyn
said
miss
conyngham
gravely
i
want
to
ask
you
one
or
two
questions
by
yourself
yes
miss
conyngham
joey
answered
wonderingly
have
you
gone
outside
at
night
think
before
you
speak
that
question
did
not
need
thinking
about
joey
remembered
that
first
night
far
too
vividly
to
hesitate
yes
miss
conyngham
when
the
first
night
i
was
here
i
got
out
on
the
roof
did
matron
tell
you
i
spoilt
my
quilt
she
jolly
well
takes
care
to
go
on
telling
me
answer
only
my
questions
please
you
got
out
on
the
roof
that
first
night
for
what
reason
joey
could
not
say
that
noreen
syb
and
barbara
had
been
horrid
to
her
she
turned
red
and
hesitated
the
professor
glanced
quickly
at
miss
conyngham
for
what
reason
jocelyn
oh
just
i
wanted
to
of
course
i
did
know
it
was
going
to
rain
on
my
quilt
never
mind
the
quilt
how
often
have
you
done
it
since
never
miss
conyngham
the
professor
black
eyebrows
lifted
just
a
shade
joey
saw
them
and
felt
angry
did
he
believe
her
you
are
quite
sure
of
that
jocelyn
yes
honour
last
night
miss
conyngham
said
slowly
her
eyes
on
joey
face
the
professor
saw
a
girl
a
tall
slim
girl
in
a
short
frock
climb
in
at
the
window
of
the
laboratory
sometime
after
you
were
all
supposed
to
be
in
bed
but
before
the
servants
had
locked
up
he
was
not
near
enough
to
be
quite
sure
about
her
but
this
morning
he
found
this
handkerchief
under
the
window
she
held
out
the
handkerchief
a
small
one
rather
grubby
joey
name
in
mums
stared
up
at
her
from
one
corner
it
was
certainly
hers
it
was
in
fact
the
handkerchief
she
had
used
last
night
she
remembered
drying
her
hands
with
it
after
helping
barbara
to
carry
the
cauldron
of
boiling
water
across
the
stage
she
had
thrust
it
back
into
her
sleeve
she
remembered
when
noreen
demanded
she
should
tell
the
audience
how
many
syllables
the
charade
had
yes
it
mine
all
right
but
i
do
know
how
it
got
there
she
said
staring
at
it
is
there
anything
that
you
would
like
to
say
to
me
quite
alone
miss
conyngham
asked
her
you
do
think
i
went
to
the
lab
when
i
said
i
did
i
tell
lies
joey
flared
no
i
believe
your
word
of
honour
jocelyn
miss
conyngham
said
and
she
looked
very
straight
at
the
professor
joey
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
well
that
all
right
thanks
awfully
do
you
want
me
any
more
miss
conyngham
or
can
i
go
now
for
noreen
and
gabby
are
frightfully
keen
to
hear
about
the
things
i
saw
last
night
she
turned
to
the
professor
i
say
were
you
walking
round
the
place
all
the
time
between
ten
and
twelve
you
must
have
got
wet
if
it
had
been
one
of
us
we
have
caught
it
from
matron
for
staying
out
in
the
rain
what
do
you
talk
of
i
picked
up
the
handkerchief
suspecting
and
returned
to
the
lodge
the
professor
said
annihilatingly
it
was
not
till
i
visit
the
laboratory
to
make
a
leetle
experiment
this
morning
that
i
find
my
eyes
haf
not
deceive
me
and
then
i
looked
at
the
name
on
the
handkerchief
and
learn
who
do
me
this
injury
i
told
miss
conyngham
i
did
go
into
the
lab
joey
declared
growing
angry
in
her
turn
i
have
been
near
the
place
since
you
were
so
frightfully
cross
with
me
for
tidying
the
day
i
came
and
you
need
be
surprised
that
i
thought
you
were
walking
about
all
that
time
for
you
were
there
at
twelve
when
you
were
signalling
i
saw
you
i
dare
say
you
came
back
to
do
it
only
it
was
a
natural
thing
for
me
to
think
was
it
not
rudeness
like
doubting
a
word
i
sorry
if
been
rude
though
and
i
think
you
signal
splendidly
so
jolly
fast
i
could
keep
up
with
you
the
professor
made
a
contemptuous
gesture
with
his
hands
stained
and
blunted
at
the
fingertips
she
dreams
this
child
i
haf
no
knowledge
of
the
signalling
but
for
the
other
matter
madame
may
i
ask
that
you
will
question
further
no
professor
i
shall
not
do
that
miss
conyngham
said
firmly
jocelyn
has
given
me
her
word
of
honour
that
she
had
no
hand
in
the
matter
and
i
trust
my
girls
someone
else
must
have
taken
her
handkerchief
by
accident
i
need
hardly
tell
you
that
i
shall
look
most
carefully
into
the
business
and
discover
the
culprit
but
i
can
not
act
as
you
suggest
or
disbelieve
the
word
of
a
child
who
has
always
shown
herself
truthful
jocelyn
you
may
go
i
am
satisfied
with
what
you
have
told
me
but
until
the
mystery
is
cleared
up
there
will
be
no
leave
out
for
any
redlands
girl
and
you
may
tell
the
girls
so
not
for
the
match
cried
joey
in
dismay
not
for
the
match
except
of
course
for
the
players
miss
conyngham
said
quite
decidedly
someone
is
behaving
like
a
dishonourable
coward
and
until
she
owns
up
the
whole
school
must
be
punished
that
will
do
jocelyn
the
professor
made
a
quick
step
towards
miss
conyngham
his
expression
made
joey
think
of
the
day
he
had
found
her
trying
to
perform
the
duties
of
a
scholarship
kid
if
the
word
of
the
young
lady
is
to
be
taken
before
mine
miss
conyngham
i
must
ask
you
of
your
goodness
to
seek
another
professor
of
chemistry
he
said
and
it
would
be
much
to
my
convenience
if
you
could
find
him
by
the
end
of
dis
vairy
month
since
your
young
ladies
here
haf
no
desire
to
learn
of
me
and
i
therefore
receive
insults
on
all
sides
run
away
jocelyn
miss
conyngham
ordered
and
joey
obeyed
of
course
though
it
was
a
tantalising
moment
to
be
ordered
out
would
miss
conyngham
and
the
professor
make
friends
again
she
wondered
or
would
she
accept
his
resignation
and
let
him
leave
them
as
he
asked
to
do
by
the
end
of
the
month
the
end
of
the
month
why
that
would
be
the
of
course
joey
thought
of
noreen
words
we
living
in
a
mystery
noreen
had
been
joking
but
it
began
to
look
as
though
her
joking
words
were
coming
true
it
was
then
it
occurred
to
her
that
the
minute
the
ban
on
going
out
was
removed
the
person
to
consult
was
john
but
meantime
the
school
was
under
arrest
and
the
culprit
had
still
to
be
found
joey
made
her
way
back
to
the
others
and
announced
miss
conyngham
depressing
ultimatum
on
the
way
to
remove
ii
b
classroom
by
break
the
whole
school
knew
it
and
the
head
of
the
upper
school
and
the
head
of
the
lower
met
for
a
council
of
war
chapter
xvi
the
eve
of
the
match
it
was
the
thirtieth
of
october
the
eve
of
the
great
match
between
the
lincs
ladies
and
redlands
ordinarily
all
redlands
would
have
been
in
a
perfect
fizzle
of
excitement
the
team
was
strong
the
best
so
miss
lambton
and
the
coach
agreed
that
redlands
had
run
for
the
past
six
years
and
the
weather
was
perfect
fine
and
dry
and
windy
so
that
the
field
at
deeping
royal
was
safe
to
be
in
the
best
of
all
possible
conditions
for
the
match
but
despite
all
this
gloom
reigned
throughout
redlands
from
ingrid
down
to
little
tiddles
who
although
she
could
not
understand
the
issues
could
at
least
understand
that
her
adored
joey
was
sad
miss
conyngham
had
not
budged
one
inch
from
her
pronouncement
in
spite
of
all
that
the
college
dared
to
urge
the
professor
had
seen
a
girl
climbing
in
at
the
window
of
the
lab
and
yet
no
girl
had
come
forward
to
own
to
it
until
the
culprit
gave
herself
up
voluntarily
the
whole
school
must
be
under
punishment
and
the
punishment
was
gating
at
all
times
except
the
walks
in
croc
that
meant
that
no
redlands
girl
with
the
exception
of
the
team
who
naturally
must
be
exempt
could
go
to
the
great
match
the
college
groaned
and
conjectured
and
groaned
again
it
gave
miss
conyngham
up
as
a
bad
job
gentle
though
she
was
she
was
harder
to
move
than
maddy
with
her
austere
manner
or
miss
wrestow
the
senior
mistress
with
her
strict
views
on
discipline
it
tackled
understanding
people
like
miss
craigie
and
miss
lambton
and
implored
intervention
but
nothing
made
any
difference
miss
conyngham
had
given
her
ultimatum
and
by
that
the
school
had
to
abide
until
the
culprit
gave
herself
up
the
whole
of
redlands
was
under
the
ban
joey
sometimes
wondered
if
she
were
still
suspected
in
spite
of
her
emphatic
denial
and
miss
conyngham
apparent
acceptance
of
it
she
knew
that
the
professor
had
suspected
her
ingrid
had
been
sure
that
he
whispered
her
name
to
miss
conyngham
when
she
came
in
late
on
that
dreadful
morning
and
the
look
in
his
eyes
had
been
so
vindictive
ingrid
said
that
he
must
have
really
wanted
to
get
her
severely
punished
perhaps
even
sent
away
ingrid
had
been
very
indignant
about
it
and
championed
joey
so
publicly
that
no
one
in
the
college
would
have
dared
to
doubt
her
besides
at
first
everyone
was
sure
that
the
clearing
up
of
the
mystery
was
only
a
matter
of
a
few
hours
or
at
the
most
a
few
days
ingrid
called
a
meeting
of
the
upper
school
gabrielle
of
the
lower
both
pointed
out
with
proper
firmness
that
the
offender
was
bound
in
honour
to
come
forward
and
no
one
did
and
that
second
half
of
october
went
slipping
away
with
the
college
still
under
its
ban
and
the
mystery
unsolved
the
suspense
began
to
get
upon
everybody
nerves
and
excitable
people
started
to
cast
accusations
about
more
or
less
wildly
it
did
no
good
and
only
wore
still
thinner
the
already
thin
patience
of
the
girls
and
the
thirtieth
came
and
still
the
criminal
was
undiscovered
and
the
college
paying
in
bitterness
of
spirit
for
her
silence
joey
was
trying
to
forget
the
trouble
in
the
kindergarten
with
the
babies
they
in
especial
little
tiddles
were
always
so
proud
and
pleased
to
have
her
there
that
she
snatched
half
an
hour
with
them
whenever
she
could
manage
it
despite
the
remonstrances
of
noreen
syb
and
barbara
who
thought
her
tastes
eccentric
and
not
the
thing
for
remove
ii
b
of
course
they
could
not
be
expected
to
realise
that
joey
missed
kirsty
and
bingo
quite
badly
sometimes
for
the
public
attitude
of
redlands
towards
juniors
at
one
home
was
studiously
detached
syb
wrote
to
her
small
sister
every
week
joey
knew
and
sent
her
a
present
costing
three
weeks
on
her
birthday
but
when
asked
about
her
did
know
whether
she
was
nine
or
ten
and
could
only
state
vaguely
that
she
believed
it
was
a
bad
sort
of
kid
so
joey
refrained
from
saying
too
much
about
kirsty
and
bingo
but
stuck
firmly
to
her
friendship
with
the
kindergarten
people
all
the
same
when
noreen
burst
into
the
kindergarten
during
the
between
tea
and
prep
joey
only
thought
her
friend
had
come
to
drag
her
away
and
went
on
defiantly
with
oranges
and
lemons
but
instead
of
the
jeer
which
she
expected
noreen
spoke
quite
hoarsely
come
along
joey
i
want
you
joey
looked
at
her
noreen
was
very
white
and
her
blue
eyes
were
blazing
clearly
something
was
very
wrong
i
want
you
she
repeated
do
leave
the
babies
and
come
along
there
was
an
expostulatory
wail
from
the
little
ones
joey
turned
round
and
hugged
tiddles
who
was
nearest
to
her
clinging
to
her
djibbah
in
readiness
for
the
tug
of
war
i
ca
stop
now
darling
but
i
tell
you
what
i
come
after
tea
as
we
ca
go
to
the
match
tiddles
released
her
unwillingly
and
noreen
seized
her
arm
and
dragged
her
off
at
once
what
the
matter
joey
asked
as
soon
as
they
were
outside
the
room
and
out
of
hearing
of
the
babies
noreen
gave
a
short
laugh
you
never
guess
it
is
about
the
limit
here
have
doris
redburn
and
roma
kirke
been
insinuating
that
it
was
who
broke
into
the
lab
what
you
gasped
joey
they
said
i
was
always
grousing
about
stinks
and
saying
how
i
hated
the
professor
of
course
that
a
true
bill
and
they
said
i
care
what
rows
i
got
into
that
a
true
bill
as
well
i
do
care
i
rather
wish
i
had
done
that
lab
business
only
gabrielle
is
so
stuffy
about
things
like
that
but
if
i
had
i
simply
hold
my
tongue
and
have
the
whole
coll
punished
even
if
telling
meant
getting
expelled
of
course
you
could
joey
burst
out
furious
for
her
friend
who
are
saying
it
doris
and
roma
i
just
go
and
tell
them
what
i
think
about
their
hateful
untruthful
cheek
no
stop
noreen
cried
catching
her
arm
as
she
whirled
by
it
no
good
just
going
for
those
two
they
say
lots
of
girls
think
it
wonder
if
miss
conyngham
does
too
not
said
joey
hotly
she
jolly
well
know
you
be
a
mean
outsider
whatever
else
you
might
be
but
i
do
wish
the
professor
had
gone
and
stirred
her
up
like
this
if
he
had
been
so
he
saw
a
girl
it
might
have
been
supposed
to
be
the
cat
noreen
groaned
it
pretty
beastly
anyway
one
of
our
crowd
is
behaving
like
a
rotten
outsider
and
her
rotten
outsiderishness
is
being
fastened
upon
me
it
is
rough
luck
joey
had
never
seen
her
cheerful
and
inconsequent
friend
half
so
down
she
was
dreadfully
distressed
let
me
just
go
for
that
doris
girl
she
much
the
worst
she
suggested
what
the
good
asked
noreen
dejectedly
she
put
her
arm
through
joey
and
they
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
broad
gravel
path
between
the
house
and
the
lab
why
on
earth
could
the
professor
go
to
bed
and
stay
there
instead
of
messing
round
and
spoiling
the
for
us
all
i
jolly
glad
he
leaving
at
the
end
of
the
month
she
concluded
vindictively
but
he
done
the
harm
by
now
if
only
he
had
been
so
sure
about
the
girl
joey
repeated
frowning
it
that
makes
miss
conyngham
so
stiff
about
it
otherwise
she
just
take
our
words
i
think
she
ought
to
anyway
just
think
of
the
match
and
redlands
perhaps
pulling
it
off
for
the
first
time
for
six
years
and
not
one
of
us
there
the
girl
will
own
up
in
time
joey
suggested
but
not
hopefully
noreen
shook
her
head
not
she
she
would
have
done
it
long
ago
if
she
meant
to
probably
a
beastly
slacker
who
does
care
two
pins
about
hockey
nor
the
coll
joey
added
gloomily
i
a
good
mind
to
go
to
the
match
after
all
are
you
game
joey
noreen
said
suddenly
oh
yes
i
know
there
be
the
father
and
mother
not
to
mention
the
aunts
and
uncles
of
a
good
old
row
but
one
may
just
as
well
be
hanged
for
a
sheep
as
a
lamb
if
they
going
to
suspect
me
of
beastly
things
like
this
noreen
was
driven
rather
desperate
that
was
clear
joey
held
on
tighter
to
her
arm
as
though
she
expected
her
to
bolt
off
there
and
then
it
would
be
heavenly
noreen
but
we
ca
you
know
we
ca
besides
everyone
dying
to
go
if
i
could
get
hold
of
that
skunk
of
a
girl
growled
noreen
and
then
her
eyes
lit
up
again
with
a
dangerous
gleam
tell
you
what
joey
i
a
precious
good
mind
to
say
i
did
do
it
after
all
and
then
the
others
will
be
allowed
to
go
anyway
noreen
gasped
joey
oh
of
course
i
shall
tell
miss
conyngham
that
i
did
afterwards
when
it
too
late
to
matter
you
right
about
the
other
thing
it
would
be
rather
skunkish
when
everyone
is
dying
to
go
but
i
give
them
the
chance
this
way
oh
i
know
it
an
awful
thumper
but
they
should
put
it
into
my
head
by
hinting
that
i
did
the
crime
and
lay
low
no
one
would
believe
you
did
it
joey
urged
grasping
at
a
straw
no
one
to
count
at
least
who
cares
for
silly
idiots
like
doris
and
roma
would
they
i
got
a
truly
irish
reputation
here
well
no
one
could
believe
you
would
tell
for
a
whole
fortnight
when
everyone
was
being
punished
anyway
doris
and
roma
hinted
that
quite
a
lot
of
people
found
it
easy
enough
to
believe
noreen
said
bitterly
no
shut
it
joey
i
settled
i
going
to
do
it
you
ought
to
be
pleased
you
be
able
to
go
to
your
cousin
again
did
you
say
they
asked
you
for
sunday
do
be
a
pig
noreen
pax
old
thing
i
did
mean
it
of
course
you
wo
like
my
doing
it
i
know
but
it
a
way
out
get
gabrielle
to
take
syb
for
her
other
friend
if
she
will
syb
wild
to
go
noreen
will
you
promise
honour
not
to
go
telling
miss
conyngham
you
were
the
one
till
after
prep
at
least
poor
joey
urged
in
desperation
oh
do
promise
noreen
what
the
good
of
waiting
you
cuckoo
oh
the
real
girl
might
speak
or
i
might
find
a
way
out
the
cheek
of
you
because
you
got
a
scholarship
you
think
oh
talk
sense
noreen
of
course
i
do
only
i
might
find
a
way
promise
righto
till
after
prep
then
but
not
a
minute
longer
understand
noreen
disengaged
her
arm
and
departed
hastily
joey
stood
still
considering
everything
that
was
in
her
revolted
against
noreen
plan
and
yet
what
was
there
to
do
even
her
inherent
hopefulness
found
it
hard
to
believe
that
the
culprit
would
come
forward
at
this
eleventh
hour
and
if
she
did
the
guests
of
the
team
were
all
held
up
for
the
match
and
the
gating
of
the
whole
college
might
go
on
for
an
indefinite
period
possibly
even
to
the
end
of
the
term
joey
had
herself
already
realised
the
practical
drawbacks
of
the
punishment
she
had
received
a
particularly
kind
letter
from
cousin
greta
asking
her
for
the
day
next
sunday
and
miss
conyngham
had
said
write
and
decline
of
course
it
was
nothing
in
comparison
with
the
match
still
now
cousin
greta
had
been
so
nice
and
understanding
about
her
reprehensible
proceedings
on
the
former
visit
she
would
have
quite
liked
to
go
again
besides
she
wanted
to
ask
john
about
the
signalling
and
yet
to
allow
noreen
to
tell
a
lie
and
accuse
herself
of
an
act
of
unforgivable
meanness
that
could
be
right
joey
looked
up
at
the
lab
if
only
the
professor
had
not
been
so
wide
awake
that
night
she
supposed
he
was
quite
sure
of
what
he
saw
after
all
it
was
a
very
dark
night
and
then
there
came
to
joey
the
bold
thought
of
going
to
ask
the
professor
if
he
were
really
quite
sure
he
was
in
the
lab
she
could
see
his
head
moving
between
wall
and
window
and
there
would
be
just
time
before
the
bell
rang
for
prep
joey
made
one
dart
for
the
steps
and
hammered
at
the
door
please
it
not
anyone
come
to
worry
you
when
you
busy
she
called
out
i
joey
graham
and
i
want
to
ask
something
dreadfully
important
but
it
will
only
take
about
half
a
sec
there
were
steps
inside
the
lab
a
key
turned
the
door
opened
the
professor
stood
there
before
her
dressed
in
the
long
white
linen
coat
he
wore
when
he
was
working
the
violet
handkerchief
protruded
from
one
pocket
may
i
come
in
just
a
moment
joey
asked
humbly
i
want
to
ask
you
i
am
very
busy
the
professor
told
her
in
no
very
promising
voice
well
but
it
frightfully
important
joey
tumbled
out
in
desperate
haste
for
fear
he
should
shut
the
door
in
her
face
if
i
could
help
you
clearing
up
or
anything
like
that
after
to
make
up
for
wasting
your
time
now
i
would
like
a
shot
if
you
let
me
but
ah
it
is
of
course
the
scholarship
girl
that
tink
she
has
the
duty
to
tidy
here
said
the
professor
his
temper
seemed
to
have
suddenly
improved
you
may
come
in
and
tell
me
vat
it
is
you
vish
to
say
joey
came
in
even
in
that
supreme
moment
she
noticed
that
the
lab
looked
very
much
as
though
it
needed
tidying
the
professor
saw
her
glance
dere
is
so
much
that
i
must
do
to
make
all
in
readiness
for
my
successor
he
said
blandly
is
he
coming
at
once
joey
asked
in
two
tree
days
after
i
have
left
go
away
and
i
tink
i
must
be
again
up
de
night
to
prepare
the
lab
for
him
so
if
you
tink
you
see
me
signalling
again
i
sha
be
startled
joey
finished
for
him
but
i
was
really
before
it
only
tiddles
and
babies
like
that
who
are
frightened
of
you
and
they
so
little
you
know
they
ca
help
it
but
i
wanted
to
ask
you
about
that
night
it
was
jolly
dark
you
know
that
partly
why
your
signalling
was
so
beautifully
plain
do
you
think
you
might
just
possibly
have
been
mistaken
about
the
girl
you
saw
you
tink
i
make
de
lie
hein
the
professor
asked
oh
of
course
not
joey
assured
him
in
a
great
hurry
french
you
know
and
french
people
would
be
just
as
much
the
soul
of
honour
as
english
it
only
huns
who
tell
lies
one
knows
only
it
a
very
dark
night
and
redlands
girls
always
have
owned
up
about
things
before
and
it
so
desperate
about
being
stopped
from
the
match
and
all
you
know
that
noreen
the
one
whom
you
call
in
stinks
class
is
going
to
say
she
did
it
though
she
did
for
the
sake
of
the
rest
and
one
ca
let
her
do
that
can
one
an
i
am
to
prevent
mees
from
telling
de
lie
by
the
vay
it
seems
it
is
not
only
huns
dat
do
dat
after
all
by
telling
mees
conyngham
that
i
consider
myself
mistake
the
professor
said
slowly
of
course
not
if
you
dead
sure
about
the
girl
joey
corrected
miserably
only
it
dark
was
it
i
was
looking
out
of
my
window
all
the
time
so
i
know
how
dark
it
was
and
if
you
said
were
quite
sure
i
know
miss
conyngham
would
rather
believe
a
redlands
girl
was
a
mean
outsider
the
professor
lifted
his
heavy
lids
and
looked
at
her
you
are
a
good
pleader
mees
joey
graham
so
you
looked
from
your
bedroom
for
long
and
tink
it
too
dark
for
me
to
see
clear
i
will
go
to
mees
conyngham
now
and
tell
dat
i
may
been
mistake
on
one
condition
dat
you
do
as
you
offer
a
while
back
and
come
to
me
tidy
de
lab
ees
dat
a
bargain
since
i
waste
my
time
on
preventing
your
mees
noreen
make
de
lie
rather
joey
cried
joyfully
i
say
you
a
good
sort
and
you
shall
just
see
how
i
tidy
i
suppose
you
would
like
me
to
bring
gabrielle
and
noreen
as
well
i
sure
they
would
be
most
awfully
pleased
no
the
professor
said
sharply
bring
no
one
and
tell
no
one
i
do
not
want
children
running
in
and
out
they
disturb
me
all
right
joey
promised
joyfully
when
shall
i
come
at
twelve
when
you
haf
finished
lessons
the
professor
said
quite
pleasantly
for
him
and
joey
with
a
heartfelt
thank
you
flew
for
her
classroom
at
her
best
speed
arriving
late
in
company
with
two
or
three
other
laggards
really
jocelyn
graham
and
you
bernadine
and
rhoda
you
are
too
bad
miss
lambton
said
indignantly
why
ca
you
listen
for
the
bell
instead
of
coming
in
late
and
disturbing
us
all
in
this
way
take
a
rule
all
three
of
you
and
do
let
it
happen
again
the
sorry
miss
lambton
which
joey
murmured
was
conventional
entirely
she
was
not
sorry
at
all
for
she
had
a
glorious
conviction
that
the
deed
was
done
and
the
college
cleared
bernadine
rhoda
and
herself
were
kept
behind
when
prep
was
over
to
receive
a
short
but
stringent
lecture
from
miss
lambton
on
the
need
of
punctuality
and
so
did
not
go
out
to
dress
with
the
rest
but
the
attention
which
joey
was
endeavouring
to
give
to
miss
lambton
was
much
interfered
with
by
conjectures
and
scattered
altogether
by
a
sound
that
came
a
minute
or
two
later
down
to
classroom
remove
ii
b
a
sound
of
cheering
louder
it
grew
and
louder
as
girls
came
pouring
in
from
their
different
classrooms
what
be
happening
miss
lambton
interrupted
herself
to
ask
the
three
sinners
took
the
question
for
a
signal
of
dismissal
they
ran
a
great
throng
of
girls
growing
larger
every
moment
was
congregated
in
the
hall
cheering
wildly
squeezing
past
smaller
girls
and
under
the
elbows
of
seniors
joey
arrived
somehow
in
the
front
rank
a
large
notice
faced
her
a
notice
on
which
the
ink
was
hardly
dry
in
consequence
of
information
received
miss
conyngham
withdraws
the
ban
on
redlands
chapter
xvii
tricked
joey
was
up
next
morning
with
a
punctuality
that
highly
exasperated
the
other
occupants
of
blue
dorm
but
in
the
face
of
so
much
excitement
she
would
have
found
it
almost
impossible
to
stay
in
bed
even
if
she
had
not
wanted
to
telephone
to
cousin
greta
before
breakfast
to
ask
if
after
all
she
might
go
to
her
on
sunday
miss
conyngham
had
given
gracious
permission
for
the
use
of
the
overnight
and
if
joey
was
to
be
at
the
lab
at
she
would
not
have
a
minute
to
spare
most
likely
till
the
match
was
over
and
this
was
saturday
she
leaned
far
out
of
her
window
first
thing
to
see
if
the
weather
was
smiling
on
the
match
it
was
quite
fine
and
clear
with
a
sky
that
looked
a
long
way
off
slightly
flecked
with
fine
mares
tails
and
a
sea
that
seemed
comparatively
near
lying
silver
grey
on
the
luminous
horizon
oh
get
back
to
bed
groaned
noreen
from
half
under
the
bedclothes
but
joey
got
up
all
the
same
and
dashed
downstairs
to
the
the
housemaids
had
just
finished
with
miss
conyngham
room
and
were
sweeping
the
hall
joey
shut
the
door
to
get
away
from
the
dust
and
noise
and
asked
for
colonel
sturt
number
at
the
exchange
she
got
it
but
it
was
an
unfamiliar
voice
that
answered
her

not
be
disturbed

joey
said
relieved
and
a
minute
later
heard
the
heavy
thump
of
crutches
and
a
decorous
voice
saying
a
young
lady
to
speak
to
you

the
receiver

out
of
my
window
signalling

all
by
himself
in
the
middle
of
the
night
tell
that
to
someone
younger
my
dear
kid
joey
took
no
notice
of
the
jeer
john
is
dot
dash
dash
dash
j
she
demanded
yes

and
is
a
of
course
then
what
does
ja
spell
all
by
itself
all
by
itself
it
the
german
for
yes
john
told
her
after
a
second
pause
but
your
stinks
man
is
french
is
he
yes
professor
trouville
was
that
his
signalling
you
saw
that
was
his
signalling
whose
was
it
i
do
know
it
seemed
to
come
from
a
long
way
off
you
said
the
professor
signalled
yes
he
did
first
what
it
seemed
like
yes
funny
that
john
said
joey
yes
i
think
you
had
better
come
over
here
i
ask
cousin
greta
to
send
for
you
come
i
mean
and
not
wait
for
i
ca
it
the
match
well
i
take
you
on
to
it
in
the
car
it
frightfully
nice
of
you
but
you
see
i
was
going
with
gabby
and
noreen
my
specialist
friends
i
ask
aunt
greta
to
ask
the
whole
boiling
of
you
to
lunch
then
john
said
impatiently
so
long
joey
i
ca
tell
you
any
more
till
i
know
it
myself
but
you
come
along
if
you
sent
for
but
john
i
ca
come
to
lunch
because
i
promised
to
tidy
the
lab
joey
began
and
then
stopped
because
she
had
been
rung
off
she
went
in
to
breakfast
feeling
very
doubtful
whether
she
wanted
to
go
to
lunch
at
mote
even
with
the
company
of
noreen
and
gabrielle
it
would
be
much
more
fun
to
go
with
the
team
and
it
was
more
than
possible
that
cousin
greta
might
not
see
the
great
importance
of
being
in
time
for
the
match
then
miss
conyngham
made
an
announcement
at
breakfast
that
made
her
absolutely
sure
she
did
not
want
to
go
i
am
glad
to
know
that
it
seems
possible
i
suspected
a
redlands
girl
unjustly
miss
conyngham
said
in
the
clear
voice
that
reached
without
effort
to
every
corner
of
the
big
refectory
because
i
am
so
glad
and
thankful
that
i
mistaken
i
wish
to
give
the
college
an
especial
treat
and
therefore
arranged
last
night
by
that
enough
brakes
should
be
here
by
to
take
the
whole
six
hundred
of
us
to
deeping
royal
to
see
we
hope
redlands
pull
it
off
against
the
lincs
ladies
miss
conyngham
might
have
had
more
to
say
but
she
was
not
allowed
to
say
it
the
whole
school
rose
at
her
and
the
cheering
as
noreen
remarked
afterwards
nearly
smashed
all
the
on
the
table
miss
conyngham
had
to
hold
up
her
hand
twice
for
silence
before
she
could
mention
that
dinner
would
be
at
a
quarter
to
one
promptly
to
allow
of
a
punctual
start
for
deeping
royal
how
absolutely
topping
of
the
head
noreen
whispered
to
joey
i
say
i
glad
you
stopped
me
making
an
ass
of
myself
last
night
i
believe
she
just
as
bucked
about
it
as
we
are
really
bags
i
next
place
to
you
old
thing
in
our
bus
i
not
going
joey
explained
mournfully
not
going
not
with
the
rest
i
mean
i
got
to
go
to
lunch
with
my
cousin
what
rot
you
ca
why
we
should
have
no
end
of
a
time
driving
you
go
quite
close
to
the
stakes
by
the
shore
of
the
joey
began
to
wish
very
acutely
that
she
had
rung
up
mote
again
directly
she
was
cut
off
and
explained
that
she
could
manage
saturday
only
john
had
startled
her
just
for
a
minute
he
had
seemed
so
oddly
sure
that
she
must
come
and
then
the
breakfast
gong
had
gone
and
it
was
too
late
absolute
rubbish
noreen
persisted
gabby
do
you
hear
joey
wants
to
lunch
with
her
cousins
and
go
with
them
instead
of
with
us
i
do
want
at
all
poor
joey
said
only
john
seemed
to
want
me
the
conceit
of
the
kid
laughed
barbara
i
mean
he
wanted
me
about
signalling
i
think
joey
explained
in
a
hurry
oh
tell
him
signalling
must
jolly
well
wait
get
the
head
to
let
you
advised
barbara
and
joey
got
up
from
table
with
every
intention
of
taking
her
advice
but
when
she
found
herself
in
the
passage
leading
to
miss
conyngham
room
the
rather
urgent
note
in
john
voice
haunted
her
he
had
seemed
to
think
it
mattered
that
she
should
come
to
lunch
and
he
had
been
so
very
kind
in
teaching
her
to
signal
and
if
for
some
odd
inexplicable
reason
it
should
matter
it
would
be
so
poor
and
to
have
stayed
away
just
because
it
would
be
more
fun
going
with
the
others
after
all
noreen
who
was
nearly
a
year
older
than
herself
had
suggested
there
was
some
mystery
going
and
though
she
had
said
it
half
jokingly
it
might
be
true
all
the
same
she
must
put
up
with
the
duller
drive
and
not
even
ask
if
noreen
and
gabrielle
might
come
with
her
to
mote
it
was
quite
clear
they
would
not
want
to
joey
gave
herself
a
little
shake
and
marched
up
to
miss
conyngham
door
please
cousin
greta
asked
me
to
lunch
at
least
john
spoke
and
they
send
and
take
me
to
the
match
afterwards
if
it
all
right
she
said
miss
conyngham
was
very
busy
and
hardly
looked
up
joey
half
hoped
she
would
say
why
do
they
want
you
and
then
she
would
have
explained
about
the
signalling
and
the
head
might
have
said
it
did
not
matter
as
it
was
she
only
glanced
up
from
her
papers
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
yes
you
will
enjoy
that
jocelyn
get
ready
in
good
time
do
keep
your
cousin
waiting
that
will
do
joey
went
back
to
the
others
to
explain
briefly
to
several
disapproving
friends
that
she
had
not
asked
the
head
leave
to
decline
the
invitation
you
a
silly
juggins
noreen
stated
with
candour
but
if
done
it
done
i
suppose
the
head
would
never
stand
being
bothered
again
only
mind
you
not
late
you
spoil
the
match
for
gabrielle
and
me
if
you
are
remember
i
wo
be
joey
promised
she
was
off
to
the
lab
on
the
stroke
of
twelve
she
did
not
suppose
that
cousin
greta
would
send
for
her
till
nearly
as
her
lunch
was
not
till
but
there
had
been
a
great
deal
of
tidying
to
do
and
she
must
leave
ten
minutes
for
getting
into
her
best
frock
and
brushing
hair
and
nails
there
was
a
moment
to
lose
as
she
ran
round
the
corner
of
the
great
house
she
noticed
that
the
mares
tails
of
the
morning
were
spreading
fast
over
the
sky
going
to
be
a
lot
of
wind
presently
she
thought
and
that
was
all
she
did
think
about
it
just
then
for
the
work
she
had
to
get
done
by
was
decidedly
uppermost
in
her
mind
mingled
with
that
little
under
current
of
surprise
that
john
should
be
so
interested
in
the
professor
signalling
but
just
as
she
came
within
sight
of
the
lab
she
had
to
stop
for
there
was
little
tiddles
walking
solemnly
along
by
herself
not
seeming
to
mind
for
once
that
she
was
near
the
professor
lair
and
crying
not
aloud
as
the
babies
did
usually
but
with
the
tears
rolling
slowly
down
her
tiny
cheeks
in
spite
of
her
hurry
joey
had
to
try
and
comfort
the
poor
mite
what
is
it
darling
tiddles
looked
mournfully
at
her
they
wo
let
me
go
this
afternoon
she
said
with
a
sob
they
say
tiddles
has
a
cold
but
it
will
make
her
cold
more
ill
to
stay
at
home
oh
poor
tiddles
sympathised
joey
what
frightfully
hard
lines
but
i
tell
you
all
about
it
afterwards
darling
and
it
is
a
long
drive
you
know
quite
nine
miles
and
it
gets
awfully
cold
in
the
late
afternoon
you
could
cuddle
tiddles
tight
in
your
arms
then
she
would
not
catch
cold
tiddles
declared
but
i
not
going
with
the
brakes
duckie
so
i
could
hold
you
joey
said
you
are
going
to
stay
at
home
and
play
with
tiddles
asked
the
mite
with
dawning
hope
joey
shook
her
head
though
she
felt
very
unkind
no
pet
but
tell
you
everything
honour
and
play
with
you
instead
wo
you
play
with
her
now
tiddles
pleaded
she
had
a
quaint
way
of
speaking
as
though
she
were
a
personality
quite
distinct
from
the
tiddles
whom
the
college
petted
and
treated
as
a
baby
i
ca
darling
i
have
to
go
in
there
joey
nodded
in
the
direction
of
the
lab
and
you
must
let
me
go
now
for
i
have
to
be
busy
tiddles
let
go
of
her
hand
without
a
word
and
stood
looking
after
her
with
brimming
eyes
but
without
actually
crying
joey
felt
a
brute
to
leave
her
like
that
but
it
had
to
be
done
it
was
already
nearly
ten
minutes
past
twelve
the
professor
would
be
waiting
for
her
he
was
she
saw
that
directly
he
unlocked
the
door
to
her
as
quickly
as
though
he
had
been
standing
just
inside
his
face
was
less
impassive
than
usual
and
it
had
a
slightly
yellowish
look
while
the
eyes
upon
which
gabrielle
had
commented
were
strained
but
the
face
relaxed
a
little
at
the
sight
of
joey
you
are
late
i
feared
you
would
not
come
he
said
i
so
sorry
i
just
got
kept
by
poor
little
tiddles
she
was
crying
joey
explained
she
did
not
wait
to
tell
him
why
the
professor
did
not
care
for
children
and
would
not
want
to
know
she
thought
ah
de
belgian
baby
dat
fear
me
said
the
professor
showing
his
teeth
in
a
curious
smile
it
is
a
strange
idea
you
schoolgirls
have
of
me
to
one
i
am
an
expert
signaller
to
another
a
fierce
ogre
we
all
think
you
were
frightfully
decent
though
to
square
it
with
miss
conyngham
joey
said
with
conviction
do
you
know
we
are
all
going
to
the
match
all
the
school
it
never
been
known
before
yes
i
know
dat
the
professor
said
you
all
go
mistresses
and
all
at
except
for
you
did
know
i
was
going
to
my
cousin
joey
asked
surprised
she
had
never
thought
professor
trouville
would
take
half
so
much
interest
in
what
the
schoolgirls
did
he
had
never
seemed
to
think
anything
about
them
except
that
they
were
very
stupid
at
chemistry
however
she
had
no
time
for
wondering
please
where
would
you
like
me
to
start
tidying
she
asked
looking
round
the
big
untidy
place
the
professor
was
bending
over
something
on
the
table
a
little
square
wooden
box
into
which
he
appeared
to
be
fitting
a
small
glass
tube
with
care
he
did
not
even
look
up
i
need
many
bottles
from
the
closet
he
said
shall
i
get
them
asked
joey
politely
she
dived
into
the
innermost
recesses
of
the
closet
as
she
did
so
she
heard
quick
steps
across
the
floor
and
the
closet
door
slammed
making
the
place
quite
dark
joey
was
startled
by
the
suddenness
of
the
slam
and
darkness
but
she
dared
not
move
for
fear
of
stumbling
over
the
bottles
that
littered
the
floor
oh
please
open
the
door
i
ca
see
anything
she
called
and
as
she
called
it
the
key
turned
in
the
lock
do
do
that
please
i
inside
she
shouted
at
the
top
of
her
voice
but
even
while
she
called
that
fact
out
confidently
there
was
an
unbelievable
fear
looking
over
her
shoulder
she
felt
she
would
see
it
if
she
turned
her
head
and
the
knowledge
that
the
professor
knew
she
was
there
all
the
time
and
had
locked
her
in
on
purpose
she
put
all
the
courage
that
was
in
her
into
the
effort
to
push
that
horrid
thought
away
if
you
playing
a
trick
on
me
please
stop
it
now
because
there
a
lot
of
tidying
and
miss
conyngham
will
be
fearfully
vexed
if
i
changed
my
frock
before
my
cousin
sends
for
me
she
urged
look
for
me
if
i
not
there
when
the
car
comes
she
talked
into
thick
darkness
and
silence
she
could
hear
the
professor
moving
about
the
room
but
he
returned
no
answer
at
all
she
spoke
into
a
blank
wall
the
keyhole
was
still
blocked
with
the
key
she
could
see
nothing
and
what
little
she
heard
gave
her
no
help
at
all
still
she
tried
hard
to
keep
her
end
up
i
wish
you
stop
it
now
and
let
me
out
she
said
firmly
if
it
a
joke
you
had
the
best
of
it
and
if
it
a
punishment
i
should
like
to
know
what
i
done
anyhow
i
do
see
staying
here
the
professor
came
across
to
the
closet
there
was
a
little
rattle
and
the
keyhole
showed
light
he
had
taken
out
the
key
but
he
had
not
turned
it
joey
darted
to
the
door
as
soon
as
that
little
ray
of
pale
wintry
daylight
showed
her
where
it
was
she
saw
the
professor
busily
engaged
in
fitting
the
little
wooden
box
into
a
cigar
case
that
seemed
made
for
it
his
white
linen
coat
had
covered
a
neat
dark
tweed
suit
of
undoubtedly
english
make
his
moustache
was
gone
she
saw
that
in
the
moment
before
he
walked
quietly
past
the
locked
and
keyless
door
of
the
dark
closet
and
out
through
the
outer
door
of
the
lab
which
he
locked
behind
him
joey
had
seen
that
he
was
smiling
a
little
chapter
xviii
at
deeping
royal
cook
though
amazingly
capable
was
not
an
absolute
magician
few
people
are
perhaps
it
was
not
altogether
astonishing
considering
that
she
had
only
received
her
orders
last
night
when
dinner
had
been
duly
ordered
that
the
meal
was
not
on
the
table
quite
at
it
was
in
fact
seven
minutes
late
not
an
extraordinary
delay
considering
the
circumstances
but
enough
to
make
the
meal
a
scramble
and
everybody
feel
a
little
fussed
noreen
and
gabrielle
had
both
meant
to
see
joey
before
she
started
and
impress
on
her
the
great
importance
of
not
allowing
her
cousin
to
start
late
for
deeping
royal
but
joey
was
not
to
be
seen
about
the
place
when
they
put
on
coats
boots
and
hats
according
to
directions
before
lunch
in
remove
ii
and
there
was
not
a
second
to
tear
up
to
blue
dorm
where
she
would
be
changing
into
her
sunday
frock
when
lunch
was
over
everybody
was
bustled
into
the
brakes
in
hot
haste
with
the
exception
of
poor
tiddles
who
was
being
consoled
however
by
lunch
with
the
housekeeper
in
her
own
room
and
a
liberal
supply
of
sweet
biscuits
and
almonds
and
raisins
rotten
about
joey
not
coming
with
us
grumbled
noreen
as
the
long
procession
of
brakes
wound
down
the
drive
i
ca
think
why
she
wanted
to
go
to
her
cousin
of
all
days
she
did
gabrielle
remarked
joey
does
a
few
things
she
want
well
it
very
tiresome
she
should
do
it
i
bet
she
be
late
and
then
she
have
to
stand
somewhere
at
the
back
and
we
sha
be
together
at
all
we
could
go
back
a
little
way
to
meet
her
suggested
gabrielle
and
then
whatever
happens
we
shall
be
together
good
egg
what
luck
you
lower
school
head
gabby
if
it
were
me
i
should
have
to
ask
leave
and
probably
get
it
refused
too
noreen
whispered
for
miss
lambton
was
in
the
brake
with
them
and
she
was
young
and
great
on
discipline
and
was
known
to
disapprove
of
some
among
the
many
concessions
made
to
gabrielle
exalted
position
it
was
on
the
cards
that
if
she
heard
the
plan
there
would
come
an
authoritative
order
to
keep
all
together
and
not
exert
the
privileges
of
head
of
the
lower
school
the
drive
was
a
long
one
but
no
one
in
the
whole
school
thought
so
for
an
instant
besides
the
grand
excitement
of
the
match
at
the
far
end
the
drive
itself
was
so
full
of
interest
after
passing
the
station
the
long
procession
of
brakes
kept
to
the
straight
raised
road
for
a
couple
of
miles
only
then
began
to
wind
down
on
to
the
broad
road
which
spanned
the
deeps
that
road
in
itself
spelt
romance
to
the
redlands
girls
it
was
still
christened
though
that
roger
malfrey
who
had
owned
the
chief
interest
in
the
flourishing
town
and
harbour
that
had
once
made
deeping
royal
a
famous
name
in
the
region
of
the
great
wash
and
had
sunk
a
fortune
and
years
and
high
hopes
in
the
attempt
to
make
a
lasting
road
across
the
undrained
fens
had
gone
where
effort
that
has
failed
may
wear
a
brighter
crown
than
fulfilment
now
centuries
later
sand
and
shoals
had
silted
up
the
harbour
and
of
the
old
greatness
of
deeping
royal
nothing
remained
but
the
magnificent
twin
churches
of
philip
and
james
once
hardly
able
to
contain
all
the
worshippers
of
the
place
and
open
fields
that
carried
strange
names
fishmarket
field
mummers
square
street
and
so
on
of
deeping
royal
proper
there
remained
a
straggling
fishing
village
of
perhaps
five
hundred
souls
malfrey
street
ran
in
a
line
with
the
river
for
of
its
length
a
quarter
of
a
mile
perhaps
of
green
deeps
separated
the
brimming
bankless
river
from
the
causeway
that
lifted
itself
from
the
grass
even
as
the
river
seemed
trying
to
do
and
both
seemed
making
straight
as
a
die
for
the
sea
then
when
redlands
was
some
seven
miles
behind
river
and
road
appeared
to
change
their
minds
and
twisting
sharply
ran
parallel
with
the
flat
dreary
shore
for
more
than
two
miles
only
a
narrow
strip
of
shingle
dividing
the
sand
from
the
road
on
such
a
day
as
this
the
road
was
soft
with
the
sand
that
blew
over
the
shingle
and
settled
on
it
only
to
be
whirled
away
and
flung
among
the
coarse
grass
that
still
struggled
to
grow
between
river
and
road
fighting
for
existence
with
and
purple
madder
the
sand
blew
into
the
girls
eyes
and
proved
rather
a
bar
to
absolute
enjoyment
at
this
point
the
mares
tails
of
the
morning
were
driving
madly
across
a
high
ragged
sky
the
wind
had
come
with
a
vengeance
bother
it
growled
noreen
pushing
her
curly
ends
of
hair
out
of
her
eyes
for
about
the
hundredth
time
no
plait
that
was
made
could
keep
noreen
curly
hair
in
absolute
order
hard
luck
on
the
teams
to
have
such
a
wind
as
this
it
equally
bad
for
both
anyway
gabrielle
remarked
and
i
back
our
side
for
pluck
anywhere
miss
lambton
was
looking
uneasily
at
the
sky
i
hope
it
wo
get
much
worse
she
said
but
gabrielle
and
noreen
had
an
optimistic
spirit
about
a
team
captained
by
the
great
ingrid
latimer
and
refused
to
be
really
depressed
by
the
weather
on
their
account
it
was
another
fear
which
worried
them
suppose
that
cousin
of
joey
thinks
it
too
bad
to
play
and
send
her
noreen
whispered
tragically
i
believe
she
come
somehow
trust
her
gabrielle
whispered
back
reassuringly
anyhow
we
go
as
far
as
the
reservoir
and
see
if
we
climb
up
at
the
side
of
that
we
can
get
a
splendid
view
by
this
time
they
were
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
deeping
royal
to
their
left
was
still
the
desolate
shore
with
the
narrow
strip
of
shingle
separating
them
from
it
but
there
was
a
great
sense
of
nearness
to
the
waves
which
the
high
wind
was
driving
in
big
and
threatening
with
a
crest
of
foam
before
them
crowning
the
slight
rise
on
which
the
village
stood
were
the
great
twin
churches
standing
not
a
apart
with
their
massive
outlined
sharply
against
a
clear
space
in
the
sky
below
them
clustered
the
village
through
which
the
procession
of
brakes
drove
up
a
rather
steep
street
to
the
inn
which
one
reached
through
an
incongruous
gateway
bearing
on
one
mouldering
dim
red
pillar
the
name
cut
deeply
good
hope
the
sweet
anne
wendover
whom
roger
malfrey
had
wooed
in
vain
because
the
wasting
sickness
wooed
her
more
successfully
had
lived
there
and
he
must
have
ridden
often
through
those
great
gates
which
now
stood
wide
to
and
brakes
all
the
and
bore
a
large
printed
notice
teas
provided
joey
would
like
this
whispered
gabrielle
as
the
first
brake
rattled
into
the
old
and
stood
beneath
the
new
sign
yes
would
she
queer
how
one
misses
the
kid
returned
noreen
specially
queer
when
one
remembers
how
we
barred
her
coming
from
that
school
a
man
a
man
for
a
that
quoted
gabrielle
we
were
snobs
you
were
anyway
well
it
over
and
done
with
hope
she
wo
be
late
so
do
i
observed
mademoiselle
de
lavernais
with
a
suddenness
which
took
the
two
rather
aback
they
had
not
realised
that
she
was
so
near
or
that
she
would
take
the
smallest
interest
in
their
conversation
it
had
in
fact
been
a
surprise
to
everyone
that
maddy
should
have
come
at
all
she
had
never
professed
to
take
any
interest
in
the
school
games
or
in
the
life
outside
her
classes
but
she
had
turned
up
at
the
hurried
lunch
in
her
rusty
black
toque
and
her
coat
and
skirt
of
a
cut
belonging
to
some
five
years
back
and
had
climbed
into
the
same
brake
as
noreen
and
gabrielle
the
two
turned
to
her
politely
as
soon
as
she
joined
in
their
conversation
may
we
see
if
we
can
get
you
a
good
place
mademoiselle
gabrielle
asked
and
then
we
are
going
to
try
and
keep
one
for
joey
mademoiselle
smiled
her
little
smile
that
seemed
as
though
it
were
a
thing
stiff
from
disuse
thank
you
my
child
i
am
obliged
but
i
fear
i
do
not
come
to
view
the
match
though
it
will
give
much
pleasure
to
hear
of
the
success
of
redlands
i
assure
you
but
the
hockey
is
to
me
a
mystery
and
i
seek
a
sketch
of
this
place
that
may
remind
me
of
the
when
i
no
more
see
it
noreen
stared
but
but
are
you
going
away
mademoiselle
smiled
again
yes
after
this
term
i
return
no
more
so
think
no
further
of
me
but
watch
for
your
friend
she
detached
a
little
case
that
was
slung
across
her
narrow
shoulders
take
these
if
you
will
and
you
will
see
her
from
afar
but
wo
you
want
them
mademoiselle
asked
gabrielle
not
yet
my
child
i
shall
sketch
first
presently
if
i
can
drag
my
old
bones
so
far
i
climb
one
of
the
twin
towers
that
i
may
see
the
great
view
which
is
to
live
in
my
heart
also
you
will
bring
them
back
before
i
need
them
adieu
gabrielle
took
the
glasses
gratefully
jolly
decent
of
her
she
whispered
to
noreen
as
the
procession
of
girls
began
to
wind
their
way
out
of
the
and
down
through
the
village
towards
fishmarket
field
where
the
great
match
was
to
be
played
the
wind
was
now
terrifically
high
a
regular
gale
blowing
straight
from
the
sea
lucky
they
did
bring
tiddles
the
poor
mite
would
have
been
scared
out
of
her
senses
by
all
those
great
waves
so
close
noreen
said
i
wonder
when
high
tide
is
gabby
it
must
be
pretty
near
that
now
i
should
think
gabrielle
looked
out
towards
the
sea
i
should
think
it
must
be
someone
told
me
high
tide
never
comes
beyond
that
bit
of
broken
harbour
wall
and
it
up
to
it
now
if
it
ever
come
over
i
should
think
fishmarket
square
is
an
enormous
puddle
laughed
noreen
i
do
see
any
sign
of
the
lincs
ladies
in
the
field
do
you
suppose
we
early
gabrielle
looked
at
her
watch
noreen
spent
most
of
its
time
at
the
nearest
jeweller
being
repaired
yes
nearly
a
quarter
before
time
we
might
have
chased
joey
to
blue
dorm
after
all
let
go
along
to
meet
her
one
of
the
church
towers
would
be
a
good
place
for
sighting
her
suggested
noreen
but
then
we
should
be
able
to
lay
hold
so
the
road
be
it
hope
her
cousin
wo
want
to
hang
on
to
her
by
the
way
we
do
yearn
to
have
the
whole
show
tacked
on
to
us
i
do
suppose
she
come
gabrielle
said
lady
greta
i
mean
she
just
send
joey
in
the
car
she
know
we
shall
bring
her
back
all
right
i
see
we
just
grab
joey
and
say
james
haughtily
to
the
chauffeur
come
on
they
slipped
away
unnoticed
from
the
throng
of
girls
at
the
entrance
to
fishmarket
field
and
made
the
best
of
their
pace
to
the
road
setting
out
along
it
at
a
steady
double
the
reservoir
was
nearly
of
a
mile
away
but
noreen
had
come
in
first
in
the
hundred
yards
race
for
at
the
college
sports
in
the
summer
and
gabrielle
was
a
quick
though
not
a
lasting
runner
the
reservoir
was
reached
in
an
easy
six
minutes
and
they
began
to
scramble
up
its
high
bank
the
wind
caught
at
their
clothes
it
seemed
trying
to
whirl
them
bodily
away
noreen
stopped
for
breath
gabrielle
caught
her
arm
then
she
shouted
noreen
had
plenty
of
sense
when
she
chose
to
use
it
she
nodded
and
the
two
slithered
down
the
rough
brickwork
and
dived
around
to
the
farther
side
so
as
to
face
that
furious
wind
driving
from
the
sea
they
clambered
up
the
bank
and
noreen
who
reached
the
top
first
crouched
gasping
and
laughing
with
her
hat
crushed
under
her
arm
and
her
hair
blowing
wildly
oh
i
shall
be
blown
clean
off
she
shouted
down
to
her
friend
come
and
help
me
hold
on
gabby
or
give
me
maddy
glasses
gabrielle
who
was
wrestling
with
her
hat
had
no
hand
free
and
noreen
leant
down
and
snatched
the
glasses
from
her
yes
there
a
car
she
proclaimed
ca
see
what
it
is
or
how
many
people
in
but
it
seems
to
be
doing
a
sprint
all
right
bother
that
cyclist
in
front
he
gets
in
the
way
the
car
will
catch
him
up
directly
though
said
gabrielle
it
a
stupid
my
word
they
coming
some
pace
which
the
car
people
both
come
up
and
look
your
turn
with
the
glasses
i
have
just
one
more
squint
through
them
my
sunday
hat
and
what
is
it
demanded
gabrielle
scrambling
up
in
a
hurry
for
noreen
had
broken
off
short
in
her
favourite
ejaculation
as
though
she
were
almost
too
surprised
to
speak
is
it
joey
in
the
car
who
do
you
think
it
is
on
the
and
scorching
fit
to
bust
demanded
noreen
in
a
thrilling
whisper
why
our
old
stinks
professor
no
less
she
suddenly
dived
down
from
her
position
on
the
bank
and
dropped
below
pulling
gabrielle
with
her
and
nearly
landing
on
terra
firma
with
a
great
bump
in
her
haste
he
wo
have
seen
us
has
got
glasses
let
hide
and
perk
up
like
jacks
in
the
box
just
as
he
goes
by
he
have
the
surprise
of
his
life
and
he
ought
to
be
pleased
to
see
two
of
his
promising
pupils
you
wo
call
out
or
anything
to
give
him
a
jump
will
you
asked
gabrielle
anxiously
she
knew
noreen
am
i
a
juggins
he
probably
jump
out
of
his
skin
and
break
his
precious
neck
noreen
said
i
only
want
to
say
a
suitable
to
one
who
never
bothered
to
say
it
to
any
of
us
i
noticed
her
eyes
brimming
over
with
mischief
she
caught
gabrielle
hand
and
dragged
her
round
to
the
angle
of
the
reservoir
still
keeping
the
side
farthest
from
the
sea
now
let
shin
up
this
more
rest
for
our
toes
at
the
corner
she
said
then
we
can
put
our
heads
over
the
top
and
speaking
with
extraordinary
politeness
oh
it
all
right
gabby
mention
that
the
brainiest
and
the
stupidest
girl
in
remove
ii
are
desirous
to
bid
him
a
fond
farewell
what
the
harm
of
that
we
shall
miss
joey
objected
gabrielle
i
do
mean
to
do
that
for
any
professor
noreen
who
was
scrambling
up
the
angle
of
the
reservoir
kicking
vigorously
to
find
a
managed
to
rear
her
head
enough
to
look
over
the
top
for
a
second
nor
do
i
as
it
happens
but
we
sha
she
stated
if
it
a
race
the
professor
means
to
win
hands
down
chapter
xix
against
time
joey
had
shouted
till
she
was
hoarse
she
had
flung
her
inconsiderable
weight
upon
the
door
again
and
again
in
the
hope
of
forcing
it
a
feat
performed
with
misleading
ease
in
all
gavin
books
of
adventure
she
had
to
stop
at
last
from
sheer
exhaustion
and
then
it
was
when
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
that
she
began
to
think
the
professor
had
locked
her
in
though
she
had
called
to
him
so
he
had
known
that
she
was
there
he
was
not
deaf
so
he
had
locked
her
in
on
purpose
that
was
the
first
thought
which
came
at
all
clearly
to
her
mind
the
second
was
more
puzzling
still
why
had
he
done
it
joey
never
knew
exactly
at
what
moment
it
was
that
a
suspicion
about
the
professor
crossed
her
mind
her
mind
had
travelled
quite
a
long
way
first
as
far
as
mote
what
would
cousin
greta
say
when
the
car
came
back
without
her
oh
but
it
would
somebody
would
look
for
her
yes
they
would
look
but
would
they
look
in
the
right
place
for
no
one
knew
where
she
had
gone
no
one
but
little
tiddles
all
the
girls
would
have
gone
by
the
time
cousin
greta
car
came
for
her
syb
and
barbara
most
likely
and
gabrielle
and
noreen
most
certainly
would
never
have
given
up
hunting
for
her
if
she
were
missing
in
a
mysterious
way
but
then
they
were
her
friends
the
maids
were
very
kind
and
they
would
look
for
her
in
the
blue
dorm
and
the
playroom
and
one
or
two
more
likely
places
of
that
kind
but
it
was
not
to
be
expected
they
would
go
on
looking
after
that
they
would
probably
think
she
had
changed
her
mind
and
gone
off
in
one
of
the
brakes
and
tell
cousin
greta
chauffeur
so
he
would
go
back
to
mote
without
her
and
cousin
greta
would
think
her
a
girl
who
had
been
even
ruder
than
on
the
former
occasion
with
less
excuse
and
john
would
think
her
a
slacker
which
was
worse
joey
felt
despairingly
miserable
at
the
thought
of
john
contempt
and
with
that
misery
came
naturally
the
thought
why
john
had
wanted
her
to
come
she
was
not
very
clear
as
to
the
reason
herself
but
it
was
certainly
something
to
do
with
the
professor
signalling
and
somewhere
at
that
point
a
suspicion
lifted
its
head
joey
groped
for
a
box
in
the
darkness
and
sat
down
to
consider
all
kinds
of
queer
things
about
the
professor
kept
shifting
in
a
muddled
kaleidoscopic
whirl
across
her
memory
his
curious
anger
on
the
first
day
they
had
met
the
afternoon
when
she
had
tried
to
perform
the
duties
of
a
scholarship
kid
by
tidying
the
lab
the
violet
handkerchief
he
used
with
the
queer
marks
on
it
his
prowls
and
signalling
at
night
sitting
there
in
the
darkness
with
her
fingers
pressed
tightly
on
her
eyeballs
to
help
her
to
think
joey
saw
again
that
handkerchief
hung
out
to
dry
upon
the
nursery
guard
of
the
first
form
room
and
the
little
yellow
marks
that
came
out
with
the
heat
and
disappeared
when
the
handkerchief
was
cool
again
they
might
just
have
been
washing
marks
if
washing
marks
ever
did
a
thing
like
that
joey
pressed
so
hard
upon
her
eyeballs
that
she
saw
violet
stars
instead
of
handkerchiefs
and
then
in
the
midst
she
saw
again
distinctly
those
funny
little
marks
which
had
shown
themselves
between
the
initials
of
the
professor
name
dash
dot
dash
and
dot
dot
dot
dash
that
was
morse
and
it
spelt
two
letters
k
and
what
could
they
stand
for
the
professor
name
was
achille
so
he
had
informed
noreen
when
greatly
daring
she
had
inquired
one
day
a
week
or
so
back
after
a
particularly
peaceful
stinks
class
when
she
had
not
been
addressed
as
fathead
besides
what
person
in
their
senses
would
have
a
name
first
worked
and
then
fixed
on
in
some
kind
of
invisible
ink
and
in
morse
k
v
k
stood
for
kenneth
or
kitten
or
kultur
or
kamerad
or
kaiser
it
was
odd
how
many
german
words
came
unbidden
to
her
mind
and
v
might
be
vauxhall
or
vaterland
yes
vaterland
was
spelt
with
a
v
though
it
sounded
as
if
it
were
an
joey
found
that
the
two
words
kaiser
and
vaterland
fixed
themselves
in
her
mind
and
joined
together
with
john
odd
tone
about
the
signalling
and
the
professor
midnight
expedition
and
that
lettering
that
she
had
read
the
figures
and
then
the
answer
the
was
and
ja
as
noreen
had
used
it
in
the
wonderful
charade
meant
yes
what
was
going
to
happen
and
who
had
answered
the
professor
signal
joey
mind
went
back
slowly
over
the
ground
of
this
exciting
month
at
redlands
till
it
reached
that
sunday
spent
at
mote
when
she
had
come
back
to
school
alone
and
been
caught
by
the
and
had
taken
shelter
in
the
round
tower
the
jumpy
young
man
had
certainly
been
doing
odd
things
down
below
and
he
had
not
been
at
all
pleased
to
see
her
there
at
first
that
was
certain
though
he
had
been
quite
kind
and
nice
afterwards
and
told
such
interesting
stories
it
had
never
occurred
to
joey
that
the
stories
might
have
been
intended
to
have
a
deterrent
effect
upon
her
but
could
the
young
man
obvious
jumpiness
have
anything
to
do
with
the
mysterious
business
noreen
had
thought
so
but
joey
hoped
it
had
for
if
it
were
he
who
had
answered
ja
it
meant
he
was
a
german
and
she
did
want
him
to
be
that
it
was
much
easier
to
think
of
the
professor
as
a
german
joey
had
rather
liked
the
young
man
in
spite
of
a
slight
natural
contempt
for
his
nervousness
and
then
quite
suddenly
it
all
came
over
her
a
sense
of
some
great
danger
which
was
none
the
less
frightful
but
rather
the
more
because
it
was
all
so
vague
colonel
sturt
had
thought
that
germans
were
creeping
back
into
the
country
germans
in
no
way
altered
by
the
wars
inside
and
they
were
clever
everyone
knew
that
quite
clever
enough
to
call
themselves
french
and
talk
with
a
french
accent
that
was
good
enough
to
take
people
in
suppose
she
were
right
in
what
she
guessed
and
the
professor
was
not
french
at
all
but
german
what
was
he
doing
in
the
school
lab
and
what
had
he
taken
away
with
him
from
the
lab
this
october
when
the
only
person
who
could
see
what
he
was
doing
was
locked
into
the
closet
and
likely
to
remain
there
till
the
girls
came
home
from
the
match
and
a
proper
search
was
instituted
joey
remembered
that
curious
little
box
which
through
the
keyhole
she
had
seen
the
professor
fit
so
carefully
into
his
cigar
case
it
was
not
only
something
precious
to
him
but
it
was
something
he
did
not
wish
anybody
else
to
see
and
if
he
were
a
german
it
was
something
that
no
one
must
see
because
it
was
something
that
would
do
harm
not
just
to
an
insignificant
person
like
herself
but
to
england
when
joey
thought
that
she
had
to
hold
herself
in
hard
or
she
would
have
flung
herself
upon
the
door
and
beaten
upon
it
in
a
frenzy
till
she
was
worn
out
for
everybody
who
might
look
for
her
was
away
and
no
one
knew
anything
except
her
imprisoned
self
and
the
professor
was
probably
away
by
now
with
the
mysterious
box
putting
every
minute
more
distance
between
himself
and
redlands
but
she
forced
herself
to
keep
cool
she
would
want
all
her
powers
if
she
was
to
do
any
good
she
had
heard
the
great
clock
from
the
old
clock
tower
strike
one
quite
a
long
time
ago
yes
the
school
would
have
started
and
there
was
not
the
tiniest
bit
of
a
window
in
her
prison
it
was
all
dark
and
close
and
filled
with
bottles
that
rattled
and
fell
over
if
she
moved
and
boxes
with
sharp
corners
that
cut
her
shins
mingled
with
the
other
stuffy
smells
there
was
the
rank
smell
of
newly
fallen
plaster
though
it
was
dry
enough
now
there
had
been
a
good
deal
of
rain
last
week
and
noreen
had
mentioned
casually
that
the
professor
had
been
very
cross
because
some
rain
came
through
the
closet
roof
and
spoilt
one
of
his
preparations
joey
stood
up
cautiously
and
crouching
on
the
floor
felt
for
the
fallen
plaster
groping
before
her
with
both
hands
of
course
she
banged
her
head
against
a
shelf
and
upset
a
bottle
which
smelt
overpoweringly
but
she
found
the
plaster
and
stood
up
again
considering
somewhere
there
must
be
a
tile
off
and
if
one
had
gone
she
could
surely
pull
away
more
and
attract
attention
from
above
only
how
did
one
get
up
there
shelves
of
course
joey
cleared
a
space
on
the
lowest
shelf
as
well
as
she
could
in
the
darkness
and
scrambled
on
to
it
clinging
to
the
one
above
there
was
a
crash
and
the
tinkle
of
broken
glass
but
she
was
reckless
now
it
did
matter
if
she
smashed
all
the
bottles
in
the
stinks
shop
as
long
as
she
got
out
before
it
was
too
late
hanging
on
with
one
hand
she
pushed
away
some
bottle
from
the
next
shelf
and
pulled
herself
up
on
to
it
and
so
with
much
bruised
shins
she
landed
at
the
top
and
stood
upright
the
roof
in
her
reach
at
last
she
had
expected
to
find
a
hole
through
which
she
could
put
her
hand
but
she
actually
only
felt
a
cold
whistle
of
wind
and
had
to
pick
at
the
lath
and
plaster
for
a
good
five
minutes
in
the
darkness
before
she
could
see
any
light
through
and
then
only
a
chink
she
pushed
with
all
her
might
but
nothing
happened
there
was
a
great
shrieking
and
whistling
above
her
head
and
she
realised
that
the
wind
must
be
rising
but
nothing
happened
for
all
her
efforts
she
had
thought
that
when
one
tile
was
off
the
others
would
follow
naturally
but
it
seemed
that
only
happened
when
you
did
want
it
to
do
so
she
must
have
something
to
push
with
a
shoe
would
do
only
she
must
remember
to
put
it
on
again
before
she
stepped
down
upon
the
broken
glass
strewing
the
floor
joey
unlaced
one
of
her
strong
shoes
not
without
upsetting
another
bottle
in
the
process
and
standing
on
tiptoe
on
the
top
shelf
began
a
violent
assault
upon
the
breach
in
the
roof
if
she
could
only
make
a
hole
large
enough
to
get
her
head
through
she
thought
she
would
shout
and
shout
and
shout
till
somebody
heard
and
came
to
let
her
out
it
is
very
tiring
to
stand
on
tiptoe
especially
when
one
foot
has
no
shoe
on
and
bang
at
something
above
you
joey
arms
ached
and
her
toes
ached
and
her
back
the
height
at
which
calgarloch
had
stood
amazed
was
hardly
enough
for
her
purpose
she
had
to
stretch
to
her
utmost
capacity
lucky
it
was
gabrielle
who
got
shut
up
she
thought
to
herself
and
then
through
all
her
anxiety
and
struggling
came
the
thought
of
her
two
friends
noreen
and
gabrielle
and
the
plans
they
had
made
together
for
the
afternoon
what
were
they
doing
now
joey
wondered
were
they
remembering
to
look
out
for
her
yes
she
felt
sure
they
would
do
that
they
were
the
kind
of
friends
who
stood
by
you
if
only
she
had
them
to
stand
by
her
now
her
attack
on
the
roof
did
not
appear
to
have
any
effect
but
that
of
bringing
down
unwanted
showers
of
plaster
that
made
her
choke
and
sneeze
and
more
than
once
gave
her
a
nasty
knock
but
she
kept
on
doggedly
at
her
task
she
had
to
do
it
somehow
english
people
wait
to
ask
whether
the
job
was
when
your
country
wanted
it
done
and
all
the
time
she
was
imprisoned
here
the
professor
was
free
to
do
what
harm
he
liked
because
nobody
knew
about
him
but
herself
joey
redoubled
her
efforts
and
a
tile
went
at
last
she
could
hear
it
fall
on
to
the
ground
below
one
gone
perhaps
the
next
would
be
easier
she
dropped
her
tired
arms
for
a
moment
to
rest
them
and
in
that
moment
the
big
clock
struck
two
only
half
an
hour
to
the
time
the
match
would
start
that
gave
her
a
fresh
sense
of
urgent
need
of
haste
she
smashed
furiously
at
the
roof
and
her
shoe
went
through
it
and
stuck
so
fast
that
she
nearly
came
off
the
narrow
shelf
in
her
effort
to
dislodge
it
in
spite
of
her
anxiety
and
her
aching
arms
she
had
to
giggle
at
the
thought
of
how
absurd
a
shoe
must
look
from
below
sticking
up
through
a
hole
in
the
roof
it
came
away
at
last
and
something
happened
at
the
same
moment
there
were
steps
outside
and
the
key
turned
in
the
lock
somebody
was
coming
in
joey
shouted
at
the
full
pitch
of
her
lungs
as
she
tumbled
down
recklessly
from
the
shelf
and
hopped
across
the
broken
glass
to
the
door
oh
let
me
out
i
shut
in
there
was
an
exclamation
and
the
voice
of
frances
the
superior
who
had
opened
the
door
to
joey
on
her
arrival
called
there
miss
tiddles
you
were
right
she
here
a
key
slipped
about
in
the
lock
of
the
closet
door
miss
jocelyn
what
have
you
done
with
the
key
frances
demanded
hope
died
in
joey
heart
the
professor
took
it
i
think
he
just
gone
frances
said
i
try
this
key
again
the
locks
are
nearly
the
same
oh
frances
do
try
like
a
brick
poor
joey
cried
in
a
frenzy
the
professor
only
just
gone
there
might
be
time
to
stop
him
yet
fennell
the
gardener
was
a
large
man
and
he
was
probably
somewhere
about
the
place
the
key
rattled
stopped
bother
cried
frances
run
miss
tiddles
there
a
dear
and
see
if
the
professor
gone
yet
wonder
of
wonders
tiddles
must
be
in
or
near
the
lab
tiddles
who
had
such
a
horror
of
it
but
joey
had
not
time
for
astonishment
stop
her
do
let
her
go
she
cried
if
the
professor
knew
that
she
was
escaping
from
her
prison
frances
seemed
to
be
bending
all
her
powers
to
the
turning
of
the
key
she
was
a
determined
person
accustomed
to
resisting
the
onslaughts
of
the
lower
school
upon
the
sugar
basin
when
she
poured
out
the
tea
almost
got
it
there
she
said
with
a
gasp
the
key
wheezed
and
turned
the
door
opened
joey
was
free
frances
she
gasped
and
fled
past
frances
past
little
tiddles
standing
and
scared
at
the
top
of
the
lab
steps
and
away
towards
the
house
she
had
put
on
her
other
shoe
while
frances
was
wrestling
with
the
key
but
it
was
a
dirty
hatless
girl
with
torn
stockings
and
scratched
hands
who
flung
herself
round
the
angle
of
the
house
as
the
steadily
decreasing
throb
throb
of
a
announced
that
the
professor
was
making
full
speed
down
the
drive
and
out
to
the
world
beyond
joey
did
not
call
the
gardener
the
professor
had
gone
he
would
be
no
good
now
she
dashed
through
the
side
door
and
fled
like
the
wind
to
miss
conyngham
room
it
would
be
empty
now
of
course
there
never
was
such
an
emptiness
anywhere
as
there
was
about
the
college
but
the
telephone
was
there
and
the
telephone
was
what
she
wanted
just
now
john
was
the
one
person
she
could
think
of
as
able
and
willing
to
help
one
would
go
to
frances
with
an
unsupported
story
like
hers
frances
would
look
at
you
as
though
she
was
thinking
not
another
lump
one
is
plenty
miss
jocelyn
and
there
would
be
an
end
of
it
but
john
would
understand
she
put
the
call
through
with
feverish
haste
and
a
hand
that
shook
a
little
her
knees
were
trembling
too
and
her
mouth
was
dry
but
it
did
not
strike
her
that
she
had
had
no
dinner
other
things
were
mattering
so
much
a
maid
voice
answered
her
can
i
speak
to
john
sturt
joey
asked
trying
to
sound
ordinary
and
oh
would
you
give
him
a
message
and
say
it
dreadfully
important
please
say
coming
and
i
do
think
the
professor
is
french
after
all
know
and
he
just
gone
off
in
a
tearing
hurry
and
he
took
things
from
the
lab
in
his
cigar
case
and
he
on
a
motorbike
and
he
locked
me
in
joey
jammed
on
the
receiver
and
without
waiting
to
get
coat
or
hat
fled
out
of
the
front
door
and
down
the
drive
she
hoped
miss
conyngham
would
be
very
vexed
by
what
she
was
going
to
do
but
anyhow
she
would
have
to
do
it
she
set
out
running
through
the
iron
gates
and
along
that
straight
marsh
road
along
which
the
professor
must
have
gone
first
she
had
forgotten
to
ask
that
a
car
should
be
sent
to
fetch
her
but
somehow
she
had
no
doubt
that
would
be
done
only
she
could
not
wait
her
faith
in
john
was
justified
john
must
have
beaten
all
speed
limits
she
had
run
a
mile
battling
with
the
fierce
that
seemed
to
take
all
her
breath
away
when
a
cloud
of
dust
in
front
of
her
resolved
itself
into
a
grey
there
was
a
rending
screech
and
john
voice
hailed
her
good
thought
i
meet
you
jump
in
mind
my
crutches
joey
scrambled
up
and
he
backed
and
turned
the
car
neatly
did
you
meet
him
she
demanded
breathlessly
who
the
professor
no
did
you
i
thought
he
go
to
the
station
or
something
joey
said
blankly
john
i
believe
he
a
german
in
disguise
bright
kid
john
agreed
i
to
the
police
station
before
coming
to
meet
you
but
we
could
do
with
some
more
information
this
about
his
locking
you
in
joey
told
breathless
reams
without
a
single
comma
john
whistled
h
now
where
the
beggar
gone
that
the
question
the
car
had
reached
the
point
where
the
roads
branched
to
the
right
to
mote
deep
station
and
so
on
to
the
grange
to
the
left
towards
the
sea
and
deeping
royal
if
he
only
left
just
before
you
i
ought
to
have
met
him
mused
john
there
is
a
train
for
of
an
hour
and
you
bet
a
hun
knew
that
they
so
thorough
he
must
have
gone
to
the
junction
and
then
he
would
pass
mote
of
course
think
he
went
to
have
a
squint
at
the
hockey
match
suggested
joey
doubtfully
john
shook
his
head
at
her
more
in
sorrow
than
in
anger
joey
joey
think
i
left
my
distracted
relations
in
the
middle
of
lunch
and
brought
my
own
special
and
particular
car
just
sent
me
by
the
governor
you
shall
see
all
her
points
later
on
when
we
settled
this
little
affair
to
hear
you
making
cracked
suggestions
like
that
if
our
gentleman
is
out
for
mischief
he
wo
be
specially
keen
to
locate
himself
in
the
midst
of
a
large
crowd
of
astute
redlanders
you
bet
stand
up
in
the
seat
hold
on
to
my
shoulder
that
sound
enough
and
see
if
you
can
locate
him
anywhere
joey
obeyed
she
was
breathless
with
excitement
and
though
john
had
jeered
at
her
suggestion
about
deeping
royal
he
had
certainly
seemed
impressed
by
her
story
particularly
by
the
violet
handkerchief
and
the
box
packed
in
the
fat
cigar
case
of
course
one
would
expect
a
big
boy
of
seventeen
in
naval
uniform
to
laugh
at
a
girl
of
only
thirteen
he
would
be
human
if
he
did
she
got
upon
the
driving
seat
holding
to
john
shoulder
with
one
hand
and
trying
to
clear
her
hair
out
of
her
eyes
with
the
other
the
wind
was
furious
she
found
it
quite
hard
to
keep
her
footing
though
car
was
low
a
typical
racer
if
she
had
known
more
about
cars
father
had
known
his
son
taste
to
a
nicety
john
was
out
for
ornament
she
saw
the
twisted
chimneys
of
mote
grange
far
away
and
the
corrugated
iron
roof
of
the
station
in
the
foreground
then
she
looked
along
the
road
to
the
left
clear
in
the
intensely
clear
atmosphere
that
often
goes
with
furious
wind
she
saw
the
twin
towers
of
philip
and
james
standing
against
the
grey
line
of
the
sea
but
not
one
thought
did
she
give
to
the
great
match
that
would
be
starting
there
in
a
very
few
minutes
from
now
for
not
so
very
far
away
upon
the
white
raised
road
a
figure
was
on
foot
beside
a
pushing
it
running
with
it
she
grabbed
john
shoulder
oh
john
i
sure
it
him
the
professor
and
his
bicycle
wo
go
or
something
by
jove
john
cried
he
glanced
up
at
joey
with
a
grin
i
suppose
i
ought
to
scoot
to
mote
and
get
help
and
drop
you
in
aunt
charge
john
he
get
away
shrieked
joey
john
grinned
again
he
probably
would
we
wo
do
what
we
ought
get
down
kid
i
going
to
let
her
rip
speed
record
certainly
did
not
concern
john
just
then
the
racer
leapt
forward
bumping
wildly
with
the
pace
which
john
got
out
of
her
joey
crouched
low
in
the
car
feeling
as
though
her
hair
was
being
torn
from
her
head
but
blissfully
happy
all
the
same
she
had
absolute
confidence
in
john
he
would
deal
with
the
professor
it
did
not
occur
to
her
that
john
on
crutches
might
not
be
a
match
for
a
determined
man
in
perfect
health
her
only
fear
was
that
the
might
get
going
too
soon
there
are
few
bends
in
a
fen
road
those
who
made
them
may
have
had
the
roads
of
russia
in
their
minds
for
fen
roads
tend
to
be
drawn
with
a
ruler
from
end
to
end
they
saw
the
professor
still
struggling
with
his
bicycle
more
than
a
mile
away
they
saw
him
run
pushing
his
machine
and
this
time
it
fired
and
went
joey
said
oh
in
deep
disappointment
john
grinned
again
some
race
joey
hold
tight
if
he
can
rip
so
can
we
he
only
spoke
once
again
you
might
loosen
my
dirk
kid
it
your
side
then
he
bent
himself
to
the
wheel
and
got
every
inch
of
speed
out
of
the
car
that
was
in
her
the
distance
between
car
and
bicycle
diminished
slowly
the
wind
roared
and
tasted
salt
to
the
lips
the
towers
of
philip
and
james
stood
higher
and
higher
and
now
the
high
parapet
of
the
reservoir
was
in
sight
when
they
passed
that
deeping
royal
was
not
of
a
mile
away
he
must
be
going
to
see
the
match
after
all
shrieked
joey
she
had
to
scream
to
run
any
chance
of
being
heard
above
the
roar
of
wind
and
the
racing
lurching
car
there
was
still
half
a
mile
between
car
and
bicycle
when
the
bicycle
was
up
to
the
reservoir
and
the
professor
clapped
on
his
brakes
and
dashed
for
it
on
foot
john
joey
screamed
the
play
which
the
occupants
of
blue
dorm
had
acted
to
celebrate
miss
craigie
return
rushed
suddenly
into
her
mind
she
remembered
the
box
of
tiny
bottles
hidden
in
the
cigar
case
and
the
thin
cruel
smile
she
had
seen
on
the
professor
face
as
she
looked
at
him
through
the
keyhole
perhaps
john
had
the
same
thought
in
his
mind
the
car
bumped
furiously
and
all
but
overturned
the
professor
disappeared
round
the
angle
of
the
reservoir
chapter
xx
the
professor
drive
it
all
happened
so
quickly
that
there
was
no
time
to
think
or
wonder
hardly
time
even
to
cry
out
something
that
looked
like
a
hand
emerging
from
a
white
cuff
and
a
dark
coat
sleeve
appeared
for
one
instant
above
the
parapet
of
the
reservoir
just
by
the
angle
and
almost
the
same
instant
two
heads
surmounted
by
the
close
green
hats
of
the
redlands
girls
shot
up
to
one
side
of
it
the
arm
waved
wildly
and
then
disappeared
with
suddenness
below
the
parapet
the
two
heads
diving
down
after
it
with
startling
celerity
if
ever
john
new
car
travelled
it
travelled
then
joey
forgot
everything
else
the
match
the
roaring
furious
wind
the
sense
of
cold
and
hunger
what
happening
at
the
reservoir
and
then
they
were
there
john
ran
the
car
into
the
grass
of
the
roadside
the
reservoir
stood
a
little
back
from
the
road
he
brought
the
car
to
a
standstill
and
grasped
the
crutches
which
joey
had
ready
for
him
together
they
tore
round
the
angle
of
the
great
reservoir
joey
leading
on
the
ground
below
it
sat
the
professor
one
hand
clasping
the
back
of
his
head
he
held
something
close
in
his
other
hand
before
him
stood
noreen
and
gabrielle
the
latter
really
apologetic
the
former
certainly
inclined
to
giggle
though
she
was
making
a
valiant
effort
to
restrain
herself
i
frightfully
sorry
we
startled
you
so
noreen
was
explaining
we
did
mean
to
we
were
just
watching
for
joey
and
then
we
saw
you
and
thought
it
would
be
fun
to
take
you
by
surprise
i
never
thought
we
should
make
you
fall
back
honour
and
as
to
gabrielle
it
was
her
plan
at
all
so
you
ca
blame
her
noreen
clear
carrying
voice
reached
joey
without
any
difficulty
as
she
slipped
and
stumbled
over
the
coarse
sandy
grass
the
professor
was
getting
dazedly
to
his
feet
while
she
was
speaking
he
did
not
appear
to
be
much
mollified
by
her
apology
you
haf
giv
me
de
bad
fall
he
said
you
haf
made
me
de
headache
i
can
not
smoke
he
raised
his
right
arm
as
though
to
hurl
away
in
a
temper
the
thick
cigar
case
that
he
held
it
was
open
he
crushed
his
thick
thumb
down
on
one
of
the
tiny
bottles
that
filled
it
joey
gave
a
leap
like
a
young
chamois
and
caught
his
arm
the
cigar
case
she
panted
and
gabrielle
caught
it
as
it
dropped
from
the
professor
hand
in
the
surprise
and
shock
he
turned
furiously
upon
joey
you
he
shouted
and
flung
her
violently
away
from
him
snatching
at
the
little
case
in
gabby
hand
before
she
was
prepared
john
joey
screamed
but
john
was
finding
it
hard
going
with
crutches
over
the
uneven
grass
and
he
was
not
yet
up
with
them
the
professor
broke
through
the
little
crowd
of
girls
and
dashed
for
his
bicycle
he
was
on
it
if
only
it
would
refuse
to
start
no
such
luck
he
was
turning
it
in
the
road
he
was
off
john
dropped
one
crutch
and
stooped
down
next
moment
his
dirk
was
hurtling
through
the
air
thrown
with
an
accuracy
that
just
got
the
back
wheel
tyre
john
had
bowled
for
dartmouth
there
was
a
loud
explosion
and
bicycle
and
professor
were
mixed
up
in
a
heap
on
the
road
lucky
you
loosened
the
dirk
john
said
to
joey
and
then
they
all
hurried
breathlessly
to
their
fallen
enemy
the
professor
was
lying
quite
still
half
underneath
his
bicycle
is
he
killed
asked
gabrielle
in
a
quiet
awestruck
little
voice
illustration
i
frightfully
sorry
we
startled
you
so
john
bent
over
him
and
unbuttoned
his
putting
his
hand
inside
he
only
stunned
take
the
case
joey
the
professor
had
flung
it
into
his
coat
pocket
joey
took
it
out
and
gave
it
to
john
he
opened
it
and
took
one
of
the
unbroken
bottles
out
looking
at
it
anxiously
i
expect
this
was
what
he
worked
in
the
lab
to
get
done
unsuspected
think
he
got
poisonous
germs
or
something
bottled
there
asked
noreen
i
no
chemist
but
you
bet
it
some
putrid
game
like
spreading
a
rotten
disease
by
water
we
got
to
hand
it
over
to
the
police
any
way
and
some
bacteriologist
will
tell
us
all
about
it
but
first
have
this
chap
into
the
car
can
you
spare
one
of
those
sash
things
you
wear
we
better
tie
his
hands
behind
him
or
he
be
getting
away
when
he
comes
to
three
white
braid
sashes
were
at
once
forthcoming
john
took
noreen
and
tied
the
professor
up
thereby
securely
does
he
look
different
without
his
moustache
noreen
observed
oh
he
shaved
that
has
he
john
asked
he
took
it
off
in
the
lab
it
was
a
real
one
joey
explained
john
whistled
and
grinned
approvingly
you
saw
a
fair
lot
through
your
keyhole
well
i
suppose
it
pretty
clear
that
our
gentleman
was
in
the
habit
of
altering
his
appearance
for
reasons
of
his
own
another
item
in
his
bill
but
he
did
show
the
usual
hun
attention
to
detail
when
he
took
the
key
out
before
he
had
finished
everything
did
he
he
thought
no
one
would
know
where
he
was
he
forgot
tiddles
i
expect
joey
contributed
john
tied
the
last
knot
with
a
flourish
just
as
the
professor
began
to
show
signs
of
returning
consciousness
tiddles
oh
the
belgian
baby
yes
i
expect
he
forgot
her
so
she
knew
you
were
there
yes
i
think
she
saw
my
shoe
sticking
out
of
the
hole
i
made
in
the
roof
and
fetched
frances
the
pet
joey
said
i
say
gabrielle
you
think
i
be
in
a
fearful
row
with
miss
conyngham
again
for
done
dreadful
things
in
the
lab
besides
coming
out
all
untidy
i
doubt
if
you
get
it
in
the
neck
from
your
miss
conyngham
this
time
john
told
her
cheeringly
but
now
we
must
attend
to
business
how
do
you
find
yourself
now
sir
can
you
get
into
my
car
or
do
you
want
to
be
helped
there
the
professor
for
all
answer
made
a
struggle
with
his
hands
but
the
braid
was
strong
and
john
knew
how
to
tie
his
knots
no
go
said
john
you
had
better
come
quietly
i
sorry
we
had
to
tie
you
up
but
we
make
you
as
comfortable
as
we
can
the
professor
regained
his
breath
and
his
senses
i
do
not
understand
dis
outrage
he
said
i
shall
spik
of
it
to
miss
conyngham
instantly
dese
girls
shall
be
punished
i
afraid
you
cut
your
cheek
a
bit
john
said
concernedly
let
me
get
your
handkerchief
do
you
keep
it
in
your
pocket
or
up
your
sleeve
it
the
violet
handkerchief
i
want
the
one
where
the
code
letters
come
out
when
you
hold
it
to
the
fire
k
v
you
know
the
shot
went
home
what
is
this
fairy
tale
the
professor
asked
contemptuously
but
he
had
paused
before
he
asked
it
the
pause
had
been
perceptible
now
will
you
get
into
the
car
professor
trouville
john
said
politely
i
think
you
see
that
we
have
some
grounds
for
this
outrage
he
turned
to
the
girls
i
drive
you
to
the
match
if
you
like
and
then
this
gentleman
on
to
the
police
station
the
professor
struggled
unwillingly
to
his
feet
joey
looked
at
gabrielle
and
noreen
the
match
had
ceased
to
be
of
the
first
importance
besides
john
was
very
lame
if
the
professor
got
loose
by
any
chance
he
might
need
their
help
she
turned
to
gabrielle
do
you
think
we
might
go
with
john
john
this
is
gabrielle
she
head
of
the
lower
school
and
a
frightful
knut
and
can
give
leave
for
all
kinds
of
things
the
other
is
noreen
and
they
both
special
friends
look
here
said
john
to
gabrielle
i
really
think
you
had
better
give
leave
for
the
three
of
you
to
see
the
affair
through
the
circumstances
are
exceptional
and
i
doubt
if
there
will
be
much
of
a
match
in
this
wind
anyhow
besides
i
run
you
back
to
deeping
royal
before
anyone
missed
you
and
then
you
can
explain
to
your
boss
well
i
think
we
might
and
thank
you
ever
so
much
gabrielle
answered
very
properly
but
with
eyes
that
sparkled
right
john
said
and
then
they
all
bundled
into
the
car
professor
and
all
leaving
the
damaged
bicycle
in
the
road
it
was
a
terrible
squeeze
of
course
to
get
five
into
a
but
much
can
be
done
when
people
are
determined
the
professor
yellow
and
was
wedged
in
between
john
and
gabrielle
while
joey
and
noreen
squeezed
somehow
into
the
little
emergency
seat
behind
the
car
dashed
back
along
the
road
they
had
come
as
they
had
tucked
themselves
in
joey
noticed
that
noreen
shoes
were
squelching
with
wet
did
you
sit
on
the
edge
and
put
your
feet
in
the
reservoir
she
asked
noreen
laughed
no
but
when
i
wedged
my
feet
at
the
angle
it
seemed
to
have
sprung
a
leak
hush
do
tell
gabrielle
she
probably
think
we
ought
to
go
back
like
the
dutch
kid
and
stop
it
with
a
finger
i
expect
it
will
do
all
right
if
we
report
it
at
the
police
station
joey
said
but
it
must
be
a
healthy
leak
if
it
made
you
as
wet
as
all
that
it
always
happening
explained
noreen
the
experienced
the
reservoir
was
done
with
scamped
work
in
the
first
instance
you
heard
our
beloved
miss
craigie
draw
a
moral
for
our
benefit
oh
well
if
you
have
you
will
and
they
always
having
to
shore
up
one
bank
or
another
i
say
you
shivering
it
is
jolly
cold
for
motoring
john
caught
the
words
and
rammed
on
his
brakes
what
an
ass
i
am
put
on
my
coat
kid
he
began
to
struggle
out
of
his
his
arms
were
half
in
and
half
out
when
the
professor
sprang
to
his
feet
his
hands
freed
the
frayed
ends
of
the
braid
sash
hanging
he
had
john
dirk
in
his
left
hand
he
had
released
himself
by
rubbing
up
against
it
in
his
right
was
a
small
revolver
now
i
think
we
shall
talk
rather
differently
he
snarled
you
will
drive
me
to
the
station
young
gentleman
and
these
young
ladies
will
get
out
to
walk
to
deeping
royal
or
redlands
i
care
not
which
the
professor
was
holding
the
revolver
within
an
inch
of
john
neck
joey
wondered
whether
it
was
all
a
bad
dream
or
a
reality
in
which
she
ought
to
make
a
snatch
at
the
revolver
and
try
and
overpower
the
professor
but
john
settled
the
question
before
she
had
time
to
decide
get
out
girls
he
said
you
had
better
go
straight
to
deeping
royal
i
drive
the
professor
along
as
he
suggests
joey
got
out
obediently
and
the
other
two
followed
suit
hurry
the
professor
snarled
john
got
his
hands
free
of
his
coat
in
leisurely
fashion
the
girls
stood
close
together
on
the
road
let
go
for
him
whispered
noreen
but
joey
was
looking
at
john
john
thin
brown
face
was
perfectly
impassive
but
his
right
eyelid
lay
dead
upon
his
cheek
joey
knew
quite
well
that
john
alone
and
with
a
very
game
leg
had
nevertheless
something
up
his
sleeve
get
on
reiterated
the
professor
his
french
accent
was
dropping
from
him
joey
noticed
he
spoke
good
english
now
though
with
the
hard
guttural
which
hardly
any
englishman
achieves
the
car
was
a
john
whirled
off
without
remark
leaving
the
three
redlands
girls
stranded
rather
forlornly
on
the
road
they
all
three
shivered
a
little
as
the
car
grew
smaller
and
smaller
in
the
distance
they
were
afraid
for
john
and
also
puzzled
by
his
acquiescence
in
the
situation
an
acquiescence
so
out
of
keeping
with
the
little
bit
of
ribbon
on
his
jacket
added
to
which
they
were
all
three
very
cold
and
a
longish
walk
and
drive
lay
between
them
and
tea
noreen
broke
the
silence
i
vote
we
get
on
to
deeping
royal
and
tell
miss
conyngham
what
has
happened
some
story
anyhow
if
she
does
row
us
for
sloping
off
wo
she
be
jolly
excited
to
know
about
the
professor
what
do
you
say
gabrielle
and
joey
yes
i
think
we
had
better
go
now
gabrielle
agreed
i
afraid
we
ca
do
anything
for
john
and
miss
conyngham
ought
to
know
but
joey
stood
still
stubbornly
by
the
roadside
i
do
care
if
she
ought
i
going
to
wait
for
john
she
said
at
least
i
mean
going
along
to
mote
to
tell
cousin
greta
what
happened
to
him
joey
tried
to
speak
as
though
she
did
not
mind
a
bit
about
the
tramp
or
anything
you
two
go
along
to
the
match
and
tell
miss
conyngham
i
try
and
square
up
the
disobedience
and
being
so
untidy
and
letting
redlands
down
afterwards
when
there
time
joey
thought
she
had
never
realised
till
then
what
her
two
friends
could
be
each
seized
an
arm
slink
back
to
the
match
and
leave
you
to
be
in
a
row
all
by
yourself
likely
is
it
you
juggins
noreen
inquired
scornfully
and
gabrielle
gabrielle
head
of
the
lower
school
who
had
never
been
known
to
break
a
rule
since
joey
had
known
her
added
calmly
we
all
go
to
mote
joey
i
think
you
are
right
of
course
it
is
disobeying
the
redlands
rule
but
i
will
explain
to
miss
conyngham
why
we
did
it
afterwards
in
any
case
we
could
leave
you
i
say
you
are
bricks
joey
said
rather
chokingly
and
then
the
three
set
out
together
at
a
run
towards
the
turning
to
mote
they
had
passed
it
in
the
car
and
were
indeed
now
within
about
half
a
mile
of
the
round
tower
joey
found
herself
noticing
for
all
her
anxiety
about
john
how
gaunt
and
sinister
it
looked
standing
up
against
the
shivering
sodden
grass
and
the
dreary
sky
in
that
minute
before
she
and
the
others
turned
their
backs
upon
it
and
began
to
struggle
towards
mote
in
the
teeth
of
a
wind
that
seemed
to
have
grown
overwhelmingly
strong
in
the
last
few
minutes
now
that
they
faced
towards
the
sea
it
was
truly
terrific
noreen
and
gabrielle
had
their
close
school
hats
jammed
low
upon
their
foreheads
and
even
then
it
was
almost
impossible
to
keep
them
on
joey
being
hatless
was
not
affected
by
this
difficulty
but
her
djibbah
flapped
furiously
about
her
her
hair
was
all
over
the
place
and
she
found
it
really
difficult
to
keep
her
footing
it
was
extraordinary
how
much
the
gale
had
grown
within
the
last
twelve
or
fifteen
minutes
but
the
three
friends
locked
arms
and
fought
their
way
on
determinedly
joey
meant
to
get
somehow
to
mote
and
let
john
people
know
what
he
was
doing
and
after
that
we
shall
probably
meet
the
school
going
home
gabrielle
gasped
out
and
we
can
get
ourselves
picked
up
they
have
to
come
back
they
can
never
play
the
match
out
in
this
wind
i
hope
they
come
along
soon
it
going
to
pour
by
the
look
of
the
sky
and
we
have
got
macs
noreen
said
there
i
felt
a
splash
of
rain
in
my
face
already
so
did
i
but
it
was
rain
it
tasted
salt
panted
gabrielle
spray
could
come
out
here
could
it
asked
joey
we
a
long
way
from
the
sea
about
a
mile
noreen
screamed
in
her
ear
oh
no
spray
could
come
out
here
even
at
the
most
extraordinarily
high
tide
another
dash
in
their
faces
came
from
the
river
said
gabrielle
they
had
almost
reached
the
bridge
that
spans
the
river
mentle
about
of
a
mile
beyond
the
round
tower
the
water
was
surging
angrily
against
the
arches
and
at
intervals
of
a
minute
or
so
sending
up
a
great
splash
over
the
very
low
stone
border
and
into
the
road
funny
because
it
ca
be
high
tide
yet
said
noreen
i
looked
it
up
to
see
if
there
was
any
chance
of
the
team
getting
splashed
in
fishmarket
field
it
is
till
then
it
going
to
be
an
extra
specially
high
one
remarked
the
experienced
gabrielle
looking
down
at
the
surging
bankless
mentle
i
should
think
they
would
get
some
healthy
splashes
in
the
field
the
spray
comes
right
over
the
old
in
a
really
rough
tide
oh
never
mind
the
old
tide
let
get
on
to
mote
urged
joey
and
just
as
she
said
it
the
thing
happened
there
was
a
sudden
appalling
roar
a
long
crashing
roar
the
river
gave
a
sort
of
shuddering
sigh
and
then
far
off
along
its
brimming
level
something
seemed
to
rise
up
a
great
grey
wall
joey
stared
at
it
fascinated
but
not
frightened
but
gabrielle
knew
the
fens
she
grasped
joey
roughly
by
the
arm
gabrielle
who
was
always
so
gentle
in
her
ways
come
on
run
run
back
from
the
river
she
screamed
that
an
eigre
joey
had
a
notion
what
an
eigre
might
be
but
there
was
urgency
in
gabrielle
tone
they
all
three
turned
and
ran
back
along
the
road
that
they
had
come
only
joey
looked
over
her
shoulder
and
thought
she
never
would
forget
what
she
saw
as
long
as
she
lived
the
wall
of
water
curling
as
it
came
swept
nearer
then
suddenly
it
broke
with
a
noise
like
thunder
and
with
a
great
swirl
and
rush
the
water
was
over
the
bridge
in
a
whirl
was
spreading
far
and
wide
was
about
their
feet
gabrielle
shouted
again
as
a
second
great
surge
brought
the
water
washing
against
their
knees
and
run
they
did
through
a
world
that
seemed
all
water
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
no
one
who
was
at
redlands
then
least
of
all
those
three
friends
will
ever
forget
that
wild
of
october
when
the
old
went
down
and
the
highest
tide
that
men
had
known
for
thirty
years
burst
in
upon
the
deeps
of
little
holland
chapter
xxi
in
the
round
tower
there
are
white
posts
set
at
intervals
along
the
fen
roads
to
guide
travellers
in
the
dark
a
necessary
precaution
as
the
roads
are
often
and
for
half
the
year
those
ditches
brim
the
posts
are
barely
two
feet
in
height
by
the
time
the
girls
had
reached
the
spot
where
john
had
left
them
only
the
tops
of
those
posts
were
left
uncovered
the
tide
was
plainly
driving
in
with
terrific
force
and
wherever
they
looked
they
saw
nothing
but
the
waste
of
tossing
water
not
one
of
the
three
would
have
owned
to
being
frightened
and
it
was
in
quite
a
cheerful
voice
that
noreen
put
their
worst
danger
into
words
hurry
up
you
two
we
must
get
somewhere
before
the
posts
cover
or
we
sha
be
able
to
find
the
road
joey
remembered
the
deep
slanting
ditches
to
slip
into
one
of
them
had
been
a
very
real
danger
on
that
foggy
sunday
when
she
had
come
back
alone
from
cousin
greta
to
do
so
now
would
be
almost
certain
death
she
did
her
best
to
splash
along
faster
though
she
was
beginning
to
feel
decidedly
conscious
that
it
was
a
long
time
since
breakfast
and
that
she
was
chilled
to
the
bone
it
seemed
as
though
the
three
of
them
had
been
splashing
through
that
cold
swirly
water
for
years
and
there
did
seem
any
particular
end
to
it
and
what
had
happened
to
john
where
are
we
going
she
asked
dully
the
round
tower
is
nearest
she
had
to
look
round
as
she
spoke
to
make
sure
that
the
tower
was
there
all
the
familiar
objects
looked
so
different
standing
in
this
vast
sea
yes
it
nearest
but
we
wo
go
there
gabrielle
said
in
her
sensible
way
you
see
though
it
uncomfortable
and
very
cold
to
go
wading
along
like
this
we
are
quite
safe
on
the
road
till
the
water
is
a
good
bit
deeper
to
try
and
get
across
the
deeps
with
the
floods
out
would
be
almost
as
risky
as
it
would
have
been
to
try
and
cross
the
river
just
now
when
it
was
pouring
across
the
bridge
if
we
just
keep
along
quietly
we
shall
come
to
the
turning
off
to
hesgate
church
and
rectory
and
we
can
get
shelter
there
till
the
tide
goes
down
or
someone
comes
for
us
gabrielle
tone
had
a
very
cheering
effect
she
was
the
smallest
of
the
three
but
she
was
quite
the
head
of
the
lower
school
just
then
and
no
one
thought
of
disputing
her
verdict
what
do
you
think
the
others
are
doing
joey
asked
anxiously
she
had
been
afraid
to
ask
that
question
before
but
gabrielle
seemed
so
undisturbed
by
the
ways
of
floods
that
she
felt
things
could
not
be
as
bad
as
they
had
seemed
i
think
they
will
be
quite
all
right
gabrielle
said
you
see
deeping
royal
is
used
to
high
tides
and
things
of
that
sort
and
people
always
take
refuge
in
the
churches
there
the
towers
were
built
frightfully
strong
on
purpose
miss
conyngham
once
told
us
about
a
big
flood
in
it
was
i
think
and
the
people
had
to
stay
in
the
twin
towers
all
night
while
the
great
waves
surged
round
one
man
was
so
grateful
that
he
gave
a
new
peal
of
bells
to
both
towers
and
put
a
text
on
the
biggest
bell
flood
arose
the
stream
beat
vehemently
upon
that
house
and
could
not
shake
it
i
like
that
joey
said
yes
was
it
decent
and
he
never
gave
his
name
either
he
was
a
stranger
in
deeping
royal
and
he
just
sent
the
bells
from
london
when
he
had
got
away
safely
the
vicar
had
gift
of
a
grateful
heart
carved
below
his
text
on
the
bell
and
they
ring
a
peal
every
year
on
the
anniversary
of
the
great
flood
in
memory
of
him
that
day
comes
in
the
spring
we
always
get
high
tides
special
tides
you
know
at
spring
and
autumn
well
this
one
will
have
come
to
its
highest
pretty
soon
i
expect
joey
said
you
got
a
watch
gabrielle
what
the
time
gabrielle
looked
five
past
three
and
we
just
opposite
the
round
tower
that
means
it
is
much
more
than
a
mile
to
hesgate
rectory
we
shall
what
they
might
have
done
remained
unknown
there
was
a
curious
sound
behind
them
nothing
very
loud
but
loud
enough
to
make
them
look
round
the
water
all
around
them
seemed
to
upheave
violently
instinctively
they
clung
together
and
it
was
a
mercy
that
they
did
there
was
a
terrific
suck
and
gurgle
about
them
and
next
moment
the
white
posts
were
all
obliterated
and
they
were
swaying
helplessly
in
a
great
waste
of
water
which
had
suddenly
grown
frighteningly
deep
what
is
it
joey
gasped
as
the
first
shock
passed
and
they
found
themselves
still
on
their
feet
but
with
the
water
washing
nearly
to
their
waists
i
do
know
gabrielle
said
staring
around
her
but
noreen
gave
a
little
choke
you
bet
it
the
reservoir
that
weak
bank
gone
and
it
still
forty
minutes
to
high
tide
joey
woke
up
we
must
get
across
to
the
round
tower
it
locked
is
it
asked
noreen
it
was
a
proof
she
was
inwardly
frightened
that
she
did
not
add
you
juggins
and
there
a
bad
ditch
somewhere
near
it
joey
gabrielle
added
we
could
never
find
it
now
i
could
joey
spoke
confidently
i
been
there
remember
hold
on
to
me
gabby
i
sure
i
can
dodge
that
ditch
i
know
where
it
was
gabrielle
hesitated
for
a
moment
while
noreen
and
joey
looked
anxiously
at
her
every
one
knew
that
gabrielle
could
not
swim
noreen
was
not
much
of
a
performer
but
gabrielle
had
been
too
delicate
to
learn
at
all
so
far
we
might
keep
the
road
she
said
but
we
might
and
it
a
mile
we
risk
the
ditch
on
one
condition
joey
if
we
slip
and
be
going
into
deeper
water
anyhow
you
know
you
and
noreen
must
save
yourselves
and
not
bother
about
me
we
not
going
to
slip
but
we
going
to
hurry
joey
said
go
in
front
because
i
know
the
way
you
hold
on
to
me
gabby
and
noreen
hold
on
to
you
we
have
to
jump
the
roadside
ditch
it
a
wide
one
but
it
will
make
a
beastly
splash
when
i
say
now
they
turned
sideways
now
shrieked
joey
they
all
jumped
and
noreen
failed
to
clear
the
ditch
and
had
to
be
pulled
out
spluttering
and
choking
by
the
other
two
they
had
landed
in
water
that
was
more
than
waist
high
for
the
road
was
raised
the
question
was
how
much
more
the
fen
dipped
before
they
reached
the
tower
joey
plunged
on
but
cautiously
putting
one
foot
well
in
advance
of
the
other
in
terror
of
that
yawning
ditch
it
was
all
very
well
to
say
so
confidently
that
she
remembered
its
exact
position
how
was
one
to
be
sure
of
the
exact
position
of
anything
with
all
the
world
water
and
a
sense
that
at
any
moment
one
might
step
clean
out
of
one
depth
joey
had
swum
well
out
of
her
depth
on
the
last
seaside
holiday
the
family
had
shared
but
then
father
was
beside
her
to
call
steady
and
do
hurry
your
stroke
and
put
your
hand
up
on
my
shoulder
when
she
was
getting
tired
swimming
now
would
be
a
very
different
matter
with
noreen
who
had
only
just
achieved
the
width
of
the
redlands
swimming
bath
last
summer
and
gabrielle
who
was
helpless
to
bring
to
safety
besides
herself
all
the
same
she
never
thought
for
an
instant
that
she
might
not
be
able
to
do
it
that
sort
of
thought
was
not
for
english
people
one
just
must
the
tide
was
rushing
in
at
a
truly
terrific
pace
but
the
three
gripping
desperately
to
each
other
kept
their
footing
and
struggled
on
and
so
after
what
seemed
an
eternity
of
nightmare
struggling
through
the
deepening
water
they
flung
themselves
against
the
wall
of
the
round
tower
at
last
hold
on
gabby
i
have
to
find
the
door
joey
cried
cheerfully
the
worst
was
over
now
she
thought
the
tower
floor
was
well
raised
and
inside
there
was
a
ladder
she
waded
round
to
the
narrow
ledge
scrambled
up
and
felt
the
door
it
was
bolted
as
before
and
this
time
she
had
no
knife
in
her
pocket
to
be
accurate
she
had
no
pocket
in
her
djibbah
when
she
had
begun
this
long
queer
day
her
handkerchief
had
been
up
her
sleeve
now
it
was
probably
whirling
hither
and
thither
about
the
deeps
joey
stooped
a
little
and
put
her
mouth
to
the
chink
she
must
make
the
young
man
hear
i
say
do
let
us
in
we
outside
your
door
she
had
shouted
at
the
top
of
her
voice
and
she
got
an
answer
though
it
was
not
the
answer
she
expected
it
was
a
queer
muffled
cry
but
it
was
a
word
and
the
word
was
help
joey
looked
down
from
her
slippery
stand
upon
noreen
and
gabrielle
gabrielle
was
shoulder
deep
she
was
clinging
silently
to
the
rough
wall
of
the
tower
but
there
was
nothing
much
to
take
hold
of
joey
must
get
the
door
open
and
go
to
her
help
at
once
got
a
knife
either
of
you
she
jerked
at
them
i
have
called
noreen
joey
did
not
dare
tell
them
to
move
from
their
precarious
position
the
water
was
washing
hard
against
the
tower
gabrielle
at
least
could
be
washed
away
from
it
quite
easily
if
she
loosened
her
grip
chuck
it
here
she
shouted
and
prayed
that
she
might
not
muff
the
catch
noreen
fumbled
and
threw
joey
leaning
a
little
away
from
the
door
with
one
hand
clinging
caught
the
knife
as
it
flew
across
the
water
and
held
it
safe
she
had
it
open
in
a
second
and
forced
the
bolt
a
minute
later
kneeling
in
the
doorway
she
undid
her
braid
sash
meaning
to
fling
it
out
to
noreen
and
gabrielle
get
hold
we
all
right
now
and
as
she
spoke
she
heard
again
that
muffled
call
for
help
from
somewhere
underneath
then
of
course
she
remembered
her
first
visit
and
the
jumpy
young
man
who
had
come
up
through
the
the
floor
of
the
round
tower
was
hardly
under
water
yet
but
what
was
it
like
underneath
that
last
call
had
been
the
choked
effort
of
someone
who
could
breathe
joey
stood
irresolute
for
one
second
but
only
one
the
jumpy
young
man
was
probably
a
german
since
he
and
the
professor
had
been
signalling
to
one
another
but
when
you
were
english
you
could
leave
even
a
hun
to
die
when
he
had
called
for
help
father
had
risked
his
life
to
bring
in
a
wounded
german
who
was
lying
in
agony
in
a
reach
of
land
she
would
not
even
have
hesitated
for
that
second
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
thought
of
gabrielle
and
noreen
holding
on
precariously
with
the
deepening
water
washing
round
them
waiting
for
her
help
in
her
heart
she
knew
that
her
friends
would
not
want
her
to
hesitate
she
darted
across
the
floor
to
the
corner
where
the
was
and
then
she
saw
what
had
happened
the
owner
of
the
tower
had
been
right
in
considering
it
rather
shaky
and
none
too
safe
a
great
stone
had
come
down
and
lay
upon
the
making
it
quite
impossible
to
push
up
from
below
joey
flung
herself
upon
the
great
stone
all
right
i
get
it
open
she
shouted
but
there
was
no
answer
that
faint
choked
call
was
not
repeated
she
pushed
at
the
stone
with
all
her
strength
but
it
did
not
budge
she
pushed
again
with
a
terrible
nightmare
feeling
that
gabrielle
her
friend
could
not
keep
her
footing
in
the
water
and
was
drowning
while
she
wasted
time
she
took
a
deep
breath
and
pushed
with
cracking
muscles
for
the
third
time
and
the
stone
rolled
over
with
a
loud
splash
and
the
trap
was
free
can
you
push
she
shouted
when
she
had
seen
him
before
the
young
man
had
come
up
a
ladder
propped
against
the
side
and
pushed
the
trap
up
from
below
but
now
there
was
no
sound
or
answer
joey
thought
of
gabrielle
story
of
the
man
who
had
been
drowned
in
the
room
below
the
round
tower
in
just
such
another
flood
and
hunted
desperately
for
something
she
could
catch
at
and
pull
the
up
she
found
a
ring
at
last
and
tugged
with
all
her
might
the
trap
raised
and
water
sluiced
down
into
the
opening
water
that
was
washing
in
through
the
open
door
the
water
from
above
met
the
water
from
below
with
a
great
splash
there
was
no
other
sound
joey
peered
down
the
wide
trap
two
groping
hands
and
a
dead
white
face
with
staring
eyes
showing
dimly
through
the
darkness
black
water
of
an
unknown
depth
washed
to
and
fro
she
flung
herself
face
downwards
on
the
edge
and
dropped
her
braid
sash
straight
between
the
groping
hands
catch
hold
the
hands
fumbled
blindly
and
then
gripped
there
was
a
fierce
tug
on
the
impromptu
rope
joey
dug
her
toes
into
the
floor
in
the
effort
to
escape
being
pulled
in
that
right
hold
on
and
get
to
the
ladder
she
shouted
make
haste
she
looked
at
the
side
where
the
ladder
had
been
it
was
gone
and
the
water
below
was
still
a
good
long
way
below
the
level
of
the
floor
and
the
trickle
washing
in
would
not
raise
it
till
too
late
for
gabrielle
and
noreen
joey
looked
round
desperately
for
something
to
which
she
could
secure
one
end
of
her
sash
at
all
costs
she
must
hurry
to
the
help
of
the
other
two
but
there
was
nothing
at
all
nothing
except
the
ladder
on
the
farther
side
of
the
tower
fixed
to
the
wall
and
to
reach
that
would
require
a
sash
of
treble
the
length
no
there
was
only
one
thing
to
be
done
unless
she
meant
to
abandon
the
young
man
to
his
fate
and
one
could
let
an
enemy
drown
when
one
was
a
soldier
daughter
it
all
right
i
pull
you
up
but
please
keep
quiet
and
jerk
or
you
drag
me
in
she
called
down
trying
to
speak
confidently
do
start
to
come
up
till
i
say
she
added
hastily
as
a
frantic
jerk
to
the
rope
all
but
had
her
through
the
trap
she
slithered
back
over
the
floor
to
the
farthest
extent
her
sash
would
give
her
and
got
behind
the
stone
that
she
had
moved
with
so
much
difficulty
then
she
looped
the
end
of
her
sash
got
a
desperate
grip
took
a
long
breath
and
shrieked
now
it
was
a
frightful
tug
her
straining
body
pushed
the
heavy
stone
with
it
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
edge
her
hands
seemed
as
though
they
were
being
wrenched
away
from
her
wrists
and
her
arms
from
her
shoulders
the
toes
and
her
knees
scraped
the
stone
of
the
floor
as
she
dug
them
in
fiercely
to
gain
hold
and
she
was
dragged
forward
all
the
time
it
never
occurred
to
her
to
let
go
but
she
knew
vaguely
that
it
was
only
a
question
of
seconds
before
she
went
through
the
trap
for
all
her
efforts
and
then
a
hand
caught
the
edge
of
the
trap
and
the
strain
slackened
suddenly
joey
fell
backwards
and
lay
there
panting
and
speechless
for
a
second
while
the
young
man
exhaustedly
dragged
himself
up
to
safety
but
she
only
lay
for
one
moment
then
struggled
up
and
to
the
door
her
heart
was
thumping
with
hammer
strokes
she
felt
sure
that
she
would
not
see
her
friends
it
seemed
such
years
that
she
had
been
wrestling
with
the
and
trying
to
grip
on
to
that
slippery
sash
but
they
were
there
clinging
tightly
noreen
with
her
arm
round
gabrielle
both
with
their
heads
turned
anxiously
to
the
door
noreen
spoke
quite
cheerfully
though
with
chattering
teeth
i
say
buck
up
with
that
sash
you
juggins
she
grinned
getting
wet
joey
did
answer
because
there
was
such
a
lump
in
her
throat
that
she
could
she
threw
the
pulled
and
ravelled
sash
and
noreen
caught
it
steadying
themselves
with
it
and
the
wall
of
the
tower
she
and
gabrielle
came
safely
to
the
door
and
scrambled
up
into
the
tower
joey
hugged
them
both
regardless
of
the
young
man
presence
oh
you
dears
what
made
you
such
an
age
noreen
inquired
did
you
stop
to
explore
the
tower
or
something
the
young
man
answered
the
question
she
saved
my
life
i
was
suffocating
there
and
drowning
and
she
pulled
me
up
i
owe
her
my
life
oh
that
all
right
joey
said
rather
flustered
anyone
would
have
lent
a
hand
of
course
but
do
you
mind
telling
us
now
whether
you
are
in
league
with
our
stinks
professor
you
signal
to
him
do
you
but
i
hope
you
are
doing
beastly
things
like
poisoning
water
for
you
do
seem
that
sort
the
jumpy
young
man
stared
at
the
three
redlands
girls
till
his
eyes
seemed
ready
to
start
from
his
head
then
he
gasped
how
do
you
know
because
we
got
the
professor
at
least
i
think
john
has
and
anyhow
we
spoilt
his
game
joey
announced
triumphantly
but
we
want
to
know
if
you
been
doing
those
kind
of
beastly
spy
things
too
because
we
do
want
to
be
hateful
but
we
could
shake
hands
with
you
and
be
friends
if
you
have
they
stood
in
the
water
and
stared
at
one
another
joey
and
the
man
whose
life
she
had
saved
there
was
a
dead
silence
for
a
whole
minute
then
he
said
i
have
worked
with
him
and
i
knew
something
of
his
plans
but
dieu
how
i
hated
them
and
him
for
my
home
is
in
alsace
and
my
father
and
mother
were
french
the
professor
who
is
no
more
french
than
you
are
had
lent
my
father
money
and
i
was
to
work
it
out
as
his
assistant
and
since
the
war
he
has
forced
me
to
work
for
him
in
this
country
knowing
i
was
too
much
implicated
to
betray
him
and
that
is
the
truth
mademoiselle
joey
held
out
her
hand
you
chuck
it
now
of
course
and
i
sure
colonel
sturt
will
see
about
your
not
getting
into
trouble
and
if
you
do
mind
i
could
speak
to
mademoiselle
de
lavernais
about
you
she
comes
from
alsace
too
we
no
end
glad
you
all
right
really
rather
said
noreen
and
gabrielle
with
great
heartiness
and
all
three
shook
hands
with
the
alsatian
solemnly
what
your
name
asked
joey
feeling
that
she
ought
to
act
as
mistress
of
the
ceremonies
in
right
of
her
former
acquaintance
with
the
jumpy
young
man
i
was
baptized
when
the
doors
and
windows
were
all
shut
my
parents
called
me
corvette
he
said
righto
we
call
you
that
joey
said
i
thought
you
could
be
a
hunnish
kind
of
german
when
you
were
so
decent
to
me
that
sunday
you
know
we
introduce
ourselves
and
then
it
will
all
be
as
right
as
rain
this
is
gabrielle
arden
and
here
noreen
and
i
joey
graham
two
drowned
rats
bowed
politely
in
acknowledgment
of
introduction
but
the
jumpy
young
man
was
not
looking
at
them
he
was
staring
at
joey
graham
graham
he
muttered
then
suddenly
i
was
with
the
gardeners
that
night
you
act
in
the
big
hall
and
you
have
the
look
of
him
then
mademoiselle
was
your
father
a
major
of
the
name
of
graham
yes
he
was
but
the
huns
killed
him
with
their
beastliness
to
him
when
he
was
wounded
and
a
prisoner
joey
said
you
saved
my
life
i
will
tell
you
all
i
know
the
young
man
said
when
the
professor
sent
for
me
to
come
here
two
months
ago
major
graham
was
dead
but
alive
and
working
in
the
salt
mines
at
kochnecht
joey
gasped
he
was
reported
killed
many
are
reported
so
but
not
all
are
dead
some
day
perhaps
a
search
will
find
englishmen
left
behind
in
germany
your
major
graham
is
one
i
gave
him
water
when
he
was
wounded
and
no
woman
would
have
pity
and
he
thanked
me
and
said
i
was
good
chap
and
smiled
as
you
smile
mademoiselle
so
i
remember
him
but
the
count
that
used
to
shoot
at
calgarloch
castle
had
a
spite
against
your
father
and
returned
him
the
tower
room
swam
with
joey
for
a
moment
she
felt
sick
and
queer
i
say
you
not
going
to
faint
or
anything
rotten
like
that
are
you
cried
noreen
because
it
a
beastly
damp
place
to
do
it
in
do
noreen
it
her
pater
that
was
gabrielle
speaking
joey
pulled
herself
together
i
all
right
only
it
it
so
heavenly
you
hear
father
noreen
seized
her
round
the
waist
yes
i
heard
and
it
heartlessness
only
you
did
look
funny
for
a
minute
joey
i
glad
and
is
it
queer
and
topping
that
everything
gone
and
happened
like
this
if
there
had
been
no
flood
or
john
had
driven
us
to
deeping
royal
as
he
intended
we
should
have
been
up
the
twin
towers
with
the
rest
and
you
would
never
have
heard
this
and
if
i
had
been
caught
in
the
that
sunday
and
known
you
were
down
the
i
should
have
known
where
to
look
for
you
when
you
called
joey
said
to
jean
corvette
and
if
you
had
not
risked
your
life
to
rescue
me
mademoiselle
joey
i
should
never
have
talked
again
he
said
and
if
we
had
been
joey
special
friends
and
waited
for
her
at
the
reservoir
i
suppose
the
old
professor
would
have
got
away
and
most
of
this
would
have
happened
gabrielle
suggested
seriously
all
very
wet
and
matron
be
cross
but
it
all
been
gloriously
worth
while
has
it
just
joey
cried
ecstatically
and
now
if
jean
mind
let
get
up
that
ladder
you
bet
john
will
be
looking
out
for
us
as
soon
as
he
has
settled
the
professor
and
i
know
he
had
some
plan
when
he
said
he
would
drive
him
jean
made
no
objection
though
he
was
still
too
much
exhausted
to
go
with
them
but
the
three
friends
undeterred
by
wet
and
clinging
garments
climbed
the
shaky
ladders
to
what
was
left
of
the
top
floor
of
the
tower
where
they
found
the
electric
torch
which
jean
must
have
used
lying
close
under
a
window
of
course
a
is
easy
to
read
in
daylight
but
there
no
sun
and
it
getting
darker
joey
suggested
then
it
must
be
past
high
tide
noreen
said
joyfully
the
three
stood
at
the
looking
out
for
a
minute
in
silence
over
the
dreary
grey
waste
of
water
a
wicker
and
a
large
washed
aimlessly
about
near
the
walls
of
their
refuge
farther
off
a
poor
drowned
sheep
showed
half
submerged
gabrielle
put
her
arm
through
joey
we
might
have
been
drowned
too
she
said
and
instead
we
all
right
and
your
father
alive
joey
could
answer
that
for
a
second
then
she
said
huskily
thanks
awfully
and
i
glad
we
all
in
it
together
and
always
will
be
for
ever
and
ever
amen
chipped
in
noreen
the
irrepressible
gabrielle
will
be
upper
school
next
term
miss
craigie
thinks
but
she
never
desert
the
alliance
i
know
it
going
to
be
for
always
i
say
i
am
jolly
glad
i
came
to
redlands
joey
said
from
her
heart
they
took
turns
after
that
to
work
the
torch
sending
signals
out
into
the
wet
world
while
the
tide
steadily
sucked
back
and
back
leaving
the
tops
of
the
white
posts
uncovered
once
more
and
then
over
the
grey
waste
a
boat
came
and
they
tore
down
the
ladders
at
a
breakneck
pace
to
welcome
john
rowed
by
a
sturdy
policeman
what
happened
to
him
the
professor
shrieked
noreen
as
soon
as
the
boat
came
into
hailing
distance
oh
you
all
right
you
three
thank
goodness
john
sent
back
as
he
steered
the
boat
carefully
for
the
tower
door
i
felt
rather
jumpy
about
you
when
the
sea
burst
in
but
i
might
have
known
joey
would
come
out
top
the
professor
oh
he
is
safely
in
the
with
his
violet
handkerchief
which
it
seems
is
the
secret
insignia
of
his
crowd
and
his
precious
bugs
the
flood
was
really
a
convenience
otherwise
i
meant
to
run
my
car
into
a
ditch
and
have
him
that
way
if
poss
as
it
was
the
tide
burst
in
and
swamped
us
and
he
ca
swim
and
was
in
a
blue
funk
of
drowning
so
i
had
no
bother
at
all
just
left
him
hanging
on
to
the
car
without
his
bugs
revolver
or
hanky
and
swam
for
help
i
could
have
waded
of
course
but
swimming
was
easier
for
my
game
leg
and
more
impressive
and
they
all
right
at
deeping
royal
they
sending
boats
so
you
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
let
us
get
you
back
to
redlands
hanging
on
to
the
door
joey
stooped
to
whisper
to
john
john
be
nice
to
this
man
here
because
he
told
me
father
is
alive
in
germany
what
your
pater
alive
after
all
john
said
that
be
something
to
tell
aunt
greta
joey
looked
back
at
the
round
tower
as
she
and
the
rest
were
rowed
quickly
away
from
it
how
little
she
had
guessed
when
she
had
first
come
to
redlands
and
looked
at
it
with
so
much
interest
what
it
would
mean
to
her
that
night
while
a
disapproving
matron
armed
with
an
immense
bottle
of
sal
volatile
stood
by
urging
bed
for
everyone
joey
graham
was
cheered
at
tea
by
the
entire
school
chapter
xxii
the
great
election
it
was
wonderfully
quiet
in
the
queen
hall
considering
that
six
hundred
girls
were
assembled
there
of
course
there
was
not
the
absolute
silence
of
the
times
when
miss
conyngham
read
prayers
but
that
was
not
to
be
expected
because
the
election
it
was
always
election
at
redlands
was
in
progress
for
the
last
hour
there
had
been
a
steady
tramp
of
feet
going
to
and
returning
from
the
platform
on
which
there
sat
in
silent
dignity
the
heads
of
the
upper
and
lower
school
before
each
was
a
large
basket
and
into
one
or
other
of
those
receptacles
each
girl
dropped
a
folded
paper
containing
the
name
of
a
candidate
for
the
highest
dignity
the
school
could
offer
the
head
of
the
upper
school
must
be
chosen
from
the
upper
or
the
lower
sixth
the
head
of
the
lower
from
remove
ii
a
or
b
that
was
the
one
restriction
it
gave
a
choice
of
forty
girls
in
the
upper
school
and
of
sixty
in
the
lower
every
college
girl
had
the
right
to
vote
with
the
exception
of
the
retiring
dignitaries
even
tiddles
had
her
buff
slip
and
was
laboriously
printing
something
on
it
with
a
pencil
no
redlands
girl
would
have
forgone
the
privilege
of
voting
for
the
world
six
weeks
had
gone
by
since
that
exciting
of
october
six
wonderful
weeks
for
joey
weeks
when
extraordinary
things
happened
among
others
a
day
in
town
with
colonel
sturt
who
was
gruff
at
all
and
with
cousin
greta
when
she
was
taken
to
the
war
office
to
answer
the
keen
interested
questions
of
a
couple
of
staff
officers
who
were
very
kind
to
her
and
promised
that
the
business
of
searching
for
her
father
should
be
put
in
hand
without
a
delay
they
shook
hands
with
joey
and
congratulated
her
when
they
had
finished
she
went
to
lunch
at
the
ritz
afterwards
feeling
deliriously
happy
and
much
older
the
only
bar
to
her
perfect
bliss
was
the
fact
that
she
might
not
tell
mums
about
that
wonderful
hope
forthwith
cousin
greta
said
it
would
be
cruel
until
the
hope
was
a
certainty
and
cousin
greta
had
been
so
wonderfully
kind
and
understanding
of
late
that
joey
felt
sure
she
must
be
right
still
not
even
the
lovely
little
gold
bracelet
which
her
cousin
chose
for
her
in
bond
street
when
lunch
was
over
could
make
up
for
having
to
keep
silence
to
mums
it
was
a
better
consolation
when
lady
greta
said
she
was
going
to
ask
mums
down
for
the
old
girls
day
at
the
end
of
the
term
so
that
joey
could
show
her
the
school
and
her
friends
and
they
could
travel
back
to
scotland
together
joey
thought
it
would
be
a
particularly
pleasant
thing
to
show
the
school
to
mums
just
now
when
everyone
was
being
so
extraordinarily
nice
to
her
even
ingrid
latimer
and
her
friend
joan
chichester
that
big
sixth
former
who
had
put
joey
on
the
table
the
day
that
she
and
gabby
and
noreen
were
going
to
meet
miss
craigie
condescended
to
a
good
deal
of
notice
joey
felt
her
cup
of
pride
would
brim
over
if
she
could
bring
mums
up
to
these
majestic
people
and
say
carelessly
i
like
you
to
know
my
mother
as
she
had
heard
joan
chichester
do
when
her
people
came
down
at
of
course
in
old
days
it
would
have
been
cheek
for
any
member
of
the
lower
school
except
for
gabrielle
who
breakfasted
with
miss
conyngham
when
school
matters
needed
attention
and
could
say
i
say
ingrid
ought
we
it
was
that
we
which
was
so
wonderful
really
much
more
so
than
breakfasting
with
the
head
still
for
all
she
was
a
mere
remover
ii
b
girl
ingrid
had
been
most
uncommonly
gracious
since
the
flood
joey
thought
that
one
might
perhaps
risk
an
introduction
and
thanked
cousin
greta
warmly
cousin
greta
patted
her
hand
and
i
hope
you
will
have
a
little
welcome
to
spare
for
your
old
cousin
too
my
dear
for
i
want
to
come
too
and
to
bring
gracie
as
well
as
john
oh
are
you
coming
how
topping
joey
cried
and
the
remark
was
quite
truthful
as
far
as
cousin
greta
and
john
were
concerned
though
joey
was
quite
sure
how
she
felt
about
gracie
and
then
cousin
greta
said
something
so
astounding
that
it
took
her
breath
away
joey
i
want
you
to
be
kind
to
gracie
and
show
her
round
the
school
because
she
is
coming
to
redlands
as
a
weekly
boarder
next
term
joey
had
jerked
out
forgetting
manners
gracie
at
redlands
being
talked
to
candidly
by
people
like
noreen
and
syb
and
barbara
it
was
hard
to
picture
yes
she
is
coming
cousin
greta
repeated
with
a
smile
her
father
and
i
both
think
that
redlands
will
be
good
for
gracie
you
are
not
such
a
bad
specimen
of
a
redlands
girl
you
know
you
should
see
ingrid
wish
she
were
leaving
joey
told
her
with
conviction
and
noreen
and
gabrielle
now
they
toppers
lady
greta
smiled
and
said
she
would
take
joey
word
for
it
but
joey
must
bring
any
of
her
special
friends
that
she
liked
with
her
to
mote
subject
of
course
to
miss
conyngham
permission
altogether
life
had
been
extraordinarily
pleasant
during
the
last
six
weeks
jean
corvette
was
to
go
back
to
the
home
which
was
not
any
longer
under
the
german
heel
joey
faith
in
colonel
sturt
power
to
put
it
right
for
the
poor
fellow
had
been
justified
she
never
knew
what
colonel
sturt
said
to
the
police
and
the
war
office
or
they
to
him
but
the
fact
remained
that
jean
unwilling
share
in
the
plots
and
plans
was
all
condoned
and
he
was
to
go
back
to
alsace
with
mademoiselle
de
lavernais
at
the
end
of
the
term
mademoiselle
departure
was
an
open
secret
by
the
time
that
was
settled
and
most
of
the
girls
were
sorry
in
spite
of
their
not
infrequent
grumbles
at
her
strictness
it
was
joey
who
suggested
to
gabrielle
the
idea
of
a
farewell
offering
from
the
lower
school
but
the
whole
of
the
lower
school
jumped
at
it
and
also
at
further
plan
of
learning
the
marseillaise
properly
in
french
so
that
maddy
should
realise
the
alliance
between
france
and
england
was
a
reality
even
where
schoolgirls
were
concerned
all
remove
ii
b
contributed
a
shilling
per
girl
not
bad
when
the
end
of
the
term
and
christmas
were
near
the
junior
forms
sixpence
and
the
kindergarten
babies
threepence
the
result
was
a
highly
respectable
sum
which
was
entrusted
to
the
hands
of
gabrielle
who
went
to
lincoln
with
miss
craigie
and
bought
a
beautiful
leather
dispatch
case
fitted
with
every
luxury
and
clare
shuddering
occasionally
but
very
valiant
on
the
whole
drummed
the
difficult
tune
and
time
of
the
marseillaise
into
the
most
unmusical
members
of
the
lower
school
it
being
a
point
of
honour
that
everyone
should
sing
the
presentation
to
maddy
was
to
take
place
after
voting
miss
craigie
taken
into
confidence
had
promised
to
arrange
that
maddy
should
be
in
the
kindergarten
playroom
even
if
she
had
to
drag
her
there
directly
the
election
was
over
the
counting
only
concerned
the
retiring
officers
ingrid
and
gabrielle
out
of
all
the
girls
and
gabrielle
had
delegated
to
joey
her
position
of
spokesman
and
presenter
of
the
dispatch
case
and
list
of
subscribers
there
would
be
no
time
if
they
waited
till
after
dinner
she
said
the
old
girls
who
always
came
to
the
christmas
would
surround
maddy
and
leave
no
one
else
a
chance
to
speak
to
her
so
the
lower
school
with
the
exception
of
its
head
surged
towards
the
kindergarten
playroom
as
soon
as
they
left
queen
hall
joey
only
pausing
to
seize
the
dispatch
case
with
the
enormous
list
of
names
in
all
tied
to
its
handle
and
fluttering
out
from
it
like
a
great
black
and
white
banner
and
to
bring
it
along
with
her
miss
craigie
had
kept
her
promise
faithfully
maddy
was
there
in
the
kindergarten
with
her
rusty
as
to
front
and
shabby
as
to
dress
as
ever
but
somehow
younger
joey
thought
than
she
had
been
on
that
dreadful
day
when
joey
asked
her
to
amuse
the
class
with
stories
of
the
war
maddy
looked
round
surprised
as
the
lower
school
poured
in
and
made
a
hasty
movement
towards
the
farther
door
maddy
was
known
to
loathe
a
noise
but
miss
craigie
held
her
arm
firmly
and
gave
her
no
opportunity
of
flight
the
lower
school
fell
into
an
immense
horseshoe
in
treble
rows
the
little
ones
in
front
then
the
next
size
then
the
tallest
maddy
and
miss
craigie
were
left
inside
clare
scuffled
to
the
piano
and
struck
a
chord
and
the
lower
school
crashed
joyfully
into
the
marseillaise
all
singing
at
the
tops
of
their
voices
maddy
bore
it
though
some
of
the
pronunciation
was
to
say
the
least
of
it
eccentric
and
rhoda
watson
who
had
about
as
much
music
in
her
as
a
cow
was
shrieking
into
her
left
ear
half
a
tone
flat
throughout
joey
advanced
the
moment
that
the
music
stopped
please
mademoiselle
we
learnt
that
for
you
she
said
to
show
we
your
friends
if
you
have
us
just
as
france
and
england
are
friends
for
ever
and
ever
we
frightfully
sorry
you
going
away
and
will
you
please
accept
this
dispatch
case
with
a
lot
of
love
from
the
lower
school
that
the
list
of
us
she
added
hastily
as
the
huge
paper
nearly
obscured
the
dispatch
case
altogether
i
sorry
it
such
an
outsize
but
you
see
some
of
the
kids
write
so
large
and
we
all
wanted
to
sign
mademoiselle
de
lavernais
took
the
dispatch
case
from
joey
there
was
a
queer
look
in
her
tired
black
eyes
for
a
moment
thank
you
joey
i
would
not
have
the
paper
smaller
she
said
she
stood
quite
silent
for
a
moment
then
began
to
speak
in
her
level
voice
that
had
hardly
a
hint
of
foreign
pronunciation
about
it
to
say
thank
you
is
a
little
thing
to
feel
thanks
warmly
through
you
is
a
bigger
i
carry
that
warmth
with
me
for
the
rest
of
my
life
and
there
was
a
time
when
i
was
not
only
glad
because
i
was
going
back
to
my
own
country
but
because
i
was
leaving
redlands
now
that
is
not
so
i
leave
redlands
with
regret
but
i
shall
carry
in
my
heart
the
memory
of
it
and
of
you
all
and
that
is
something
to
bring
back
with
me
to
a
home
from
which
a
little
girl
as
young
as
tiddles
was
driven
more
than
fifty
years
ago
now
that
i
am
so
near
going
back
i
dare
again
allow
myself
to
see
the
picture
of
the
burning
château
the
flames
rising
behind
the
trees
and
my
nursery
a
blackened
shell
as
the
front
wall
fell
forward
i
see
my
cot
against
the
wall
my
doll
house
black
with
flaming
edge
myself
crying
pitifully
but
at
the
same
time
thankful
to
my
father
who
permitted
me
to
bury
my
cherished
dolls
in
the
hole
he
had
dug
to
preserve
our
heirlooms
from
the
conquering
german
my
father
himself
fired
the
château
that
no
german
should
pollute
it
and
went
out
homeless
into
the
wide
world
deserting
all
sooner
than
live
under
german
rule
i
kissed
my
little
hands
to
my
beloved
dolls
down
in
the
garden
mould
whispering
with
the
faith
of
childhood
that
i
would
soon
come
back
and
dig
them
up
again
and
after
years
i
keep
that
promise
i
go
back
alone
the
last
of
all
my
family
to
the
home
of
my
childhood
but
i
shall
not
be
lonely
in
that
i
take
with
me
the
love
of
the
lower
school
after
that
came
dinner
a
hasty
and
somewhat
noisy
affair
when
mistresses
made
no
particular
effort
to
keep
order
and
no
one
talked
of
anything
but
the
election
ingrid
and
gabrielle
came
in
rather
late
joey
tried
to
catch
gabrielle
eye
and
show
her
there
was
room
to
squeeze
in
between
herself
and
noreen
but
gabrielle
looking
flushed
and
excited
only
smiled
at
her
in
answer
to
the
invitation
and
sat
down
at
the
far
end
of
the
table
and
after
dinner
there
was
the
scramble
to
dress
to
the
tune
of
rumbling
wheels
and
snorting
cars
as
the
old
girls
and
the
more
ordinary
visitors
poured
up
in
an
unending
stream
then
the
one
side
of
the
queen
hall
entirely
filled
with
excited
girls
in
best
frocks
the
other
with
visitors
of
all
ages
old
girls
conspicuous
among
them
by
their
proprietary
air
the
school
list
read
as
it
would
stand
with
the
beginning
of
the
new
term
going
from
the
babies
in
the
kindergarten
up
to
the
high
and
mighty

great
indeed
with

grudged
nobody

after
that

joey
wanted
nothing
but
that
her
people
should
be
there
cousin
greta
had
that
mums
had
business
in
town
last
night
and
would
not
come

joey

never

be
late

the
still
she
could
see
the
door
from
where
she
sat

coming
year
as
the
first
bars
were
played
there
was
a
stir
and
a
movement
among
the
audience
in
little
groups
in
single
state
people
were
standing
up
the
years
had
rolled
away
from
these
they
were
redlanders
again
each
one
of
them
from
shy
jean
hyde
who
had
only
left
last
term
to
old
lady
rownham
quite
blind
and
bent
with
rheumatism
but
who
would
never
dream
of
forgetting
that
she
had
been
a
redlands
girl
seventy
years
ago
visitors
sat
to
listen
to
the
great
school
song
old
girls
stood
to
sing
with
the
school
and
for
five
blissful
minutes
forgot
everything
except
that
they
were
back
at
redlands
and
redlands
was
theirs
and
they
were
redlands
still
newbolt
splendid
words
rang
out
to
their
slow
grave
marching
tune
it
good
to
see
the
school
we
knew
the
land
of
youth
and
dream
to
greet
again
the
rule
we
knew
before
we
took
the
stream
though
long
we
missed
the
sight
of
her
our
hearts
may
not
forget
we
lost
the
old
delight
of
her
we
keep
her
honour
yet
girls
and
old
girls
had
got
into
their
swing
by
now
the
great
hall
rang
to
speak
of
fame
a
venture
is
there
little
here
may
bide
but
we
may
face
the
centuries
and
dare
the
deepening
tide
for
though
the
dust
that
part
of
us
to
dust
again
be
gone
yet
here
shall
beat
the
heart
of
us
the
school
we
handed
on
we
honour
yet
the
school
we
knew
the
best
school
of
all
we
honour
yet
the
rule
we
knew
till
the
last
bell
call
for
and
holidays
and
glad
or
melancholy
days
they
were
great
days
and
jolly
days
at
the
best
school
of
all
lady
rownham
was
singing
with
all
her
might
and
a
pathetic
effort
to
hold
her
slight
stooping
shoulders
back
she
had
been
vicereine
of
india
forty
years
ago
but
excepting
for
that
time
there
had
been
few
years
in
which
she
had
missed
coming
to
the
old
girls
day
and
no
time
when
she
had
not
been
at
redlands
in
spirit
they
had
sung
rather
cramped
words
as
the
school
song
for
many
of
those
yearly
festivals
that
she
had
known
but
in
these
very
old
girls
had
beat
the
heart
of
the
school
none
the
less
though
that
earlier
poet
had
lacked
the
greatness
of
expression
the
last
line
swung
out
with
triumphant
fervour
the
old
girls
sat
down
miss
conyngham
stood
forward
on
her
right
were
the
two
retiring
officers
ingrid
and
gabrielle
one
very
tall
the
other
small
and
childish
looking
amid
an
absolute
silence
from
the
assembled
visitors
miss
conyngham
shook
hands
with
each
girl
in
turn
we
all
thank
you
for
what
you
have
done
for
the
school
throughout
the
year
she
said
at
redlands
it
was
always
the
youngest
girl
at
the
school
who
called
the
cheers
a
huge
sixth
former
had
tiddles
ready
beside
the
platform
and
hoisted
her
on
to
it
at
the
right
moment
the
mite
faced
the
audience
unblinkingly
tree
cheers
for
ingrid
latimer
tree
cheers
for
gabrielle
arden
she
said
in
her
tiny
distinct
voice
it
did
not
reach
half
the
length
of
the
hall
but
everyone
who
had
been
at
a
redlands
speecher
knew
what
was
meant
by
the
appearance
on
the
platform
of
the
youngest
girl
and
the
cheers
rang
out
with
a
will
ingrid
and
gabrielle
acknowledged
them
with
a
grave
bow
and
then
turned
and
walked
off
the
platform
and
down
to
their
respective
places
in
the
hall
leaving
only
the
youngest
girl
in
the
school
to
stand
by
miss
conyngham
side
a
sealed
envelope
lay
before
the
head
upon
the
table
she
took
it
up
in
her
long
slim
fingers
i
have
now
to
announce
the
result
of
the
election
she
said
speaking
slowly
and
clearly
so
that
her
voice
reached
every
corner
of
the
great
hall
i
do
not
need
to
remind
our
old
girls
what
that
election
means
to
redlands
it
is
the
visible
expression
of
perfect
trust
it
means
that
in
the
girl
chosen
to
govern
the
upper
or
the
lower
school
the
other
girls
feel
they
have
someone
in
whose
hands
can
be
safely
placed
the
honour
of
the
school
it
is
a
great
trust
and
a
great
privilege
the
heads
of
the
upper
and
lower
school
are
my
right
hand
and
in
their
choice
i
have
never
found
the
school
judgment
in
fault
the
great
election
took
place
this
morning
the
results
were
checked
by
the
retiring
officers
and
two
mistresses
and
the
successful
names
handed
to
me
in
this
envelope
which
i
now
propose
to
unseal
before
you
all
she
ripped
it
open
and
spread
out
the
paper
it
contained
a
pin
could
have
been
heard
to
drop
as
she
gave
out
the
result
of
the
election
head
of
the
upper
school
head
of
the
lower
school
joey
sitting
fizzling
with
excitement
between
noreen
and
barbara
nearly
fell
off
her
form
in
sheer
unbelieving
amazement
what
it
not
me
that
it
she
whispered
frantically
with
a
lack
of
grammar
that
would
have
horrified
craigie
away
at
calgarloch
noreen
gave
her
a
friendly
push
you
not
deaf
are
you
you
juggins
of
course
it
you
i
thought
it
might
be
and
i
jolly
glad
i
voted
for
you
anyway
and
so
did
syb
and
barbara
joey
feverishly
squeezed
a
hand
of
both
her
neighbours
you
are
dears
she
said
unsteadily
ingrid
looked
round
the
head
of
the
upper
school
still
for
all
she
had
resigned
her
dignities
no
talking
there
the
newly
elected
officers
will
come
on
to
the
platform
said
miss
conyngham
joey
arrived
on
the
platform
still
feeling
rather
giddy
and
as
though
she
must
be
someone
else
and
miss
conyngham
pinned
to
her
frock
the
little
gold
star
brooch
that
was
her
badge
of
office
and
then
shook
hands
i
congratulate
you
jocelyn
i
think
the
honour
is
well
earned
i
know
it
will
be
treated
faithfully
she
turned
from
joey
to
joan
chichester
and
invested
her
joey
ought
to
have
been
standing
at
attention
by
that
enormous
and
distinguished
personage
whom
it
was
so
astounding
to
think
about
as
the
colleague
to
whom
in
the
future
one
would
say
we
but
she
was
not
doing
what
she
ought
from
the
platform
she
could
see
the
group
by
the
door
and
what
she
saw
put
everything
else
out
of
her
head
for
the
minute
even
this
wonderful
new
dignity
cousin
greta
was
there
with
colonel
sturt
and
gracie
the
latter
looking
far
less
superior
and
john
jolly
and
cheery
as
ever
and
leaning
on
one
crutch
only
instead
of
two
and
beside
them
mums
and
a
tall
khaki
figure
worn
and
thin
and
but
unmistakable
their
eyes
met
it
was
only
by
a
supreme
effort
that
joey
forced
herself
to
stand
still
on
the
platform
and
listen
to
the
wonderful
things
that
miss
conyngham
was
saying
about
her
to
collegers
past
and
present
the
election
of
the
heads
of
the
upper
and
lower
school
is
of
supreme
importance
she
said
the
splendid
record
of
joan
chichester
is
well
known
to
us
all
we
have
no
doubt
as
to
her
fitness
for
the
honour
accorded
her
by
redlands
jocelyn
graham
is
a
new
girl
this
term
and
never
before
in
the
history
of
redlands
has
this
honour
been
conferred
on
a
new
girl
i
am
glad
that
redlands
has
broken
its
tradition
in
that
respect
a
great
opportunity
came
to
jocelyn
graham
six
weeks
ago
and
she
showed
herself
able
to
meet
it
we
are
proud
of
her
at
redlands
and
believe
that
in
her
lives
the
spirit
that
has
always
actuated
the
heads
of
the
upper
and
lower
school
the
spirit
which
has
set
our
school
where
it
is
a
name
to
be
honoured
wherever
in
the
world
a
redlands
girl
is
found
the
big
sixth
former
did
not
need
to
touch
little
tiddles
on
this
occasion
she
was
ready
tree
cheers
for
the
new
heads
of
the
upper
and
lower
school
they
finished
at
last
though
noreen
the
experienced
declared
that
there
never
had
been
such
cheering
at
redlands
and
joey
could
dive
through
the
throng
moving
teawards
to
her
people
father
had
come
to
town
last
night
and
mums
to
whom
the
wonderful
news
that
jean
corvette
major
graham
was
the
right
one
had
been
wired
as
soon
as
it
was
a
certainty
and
who
had
met
him
there
they
had
wired
to
joey
because
mums
who
knew
what
was
going
to
happen
on
that
last
day
thought
the
excitement
would
be
upsetting
and
she
had
better
know
nothing
till
father
was
there
though
it
was
a
shame
when
it
all
came
about
through
you
joey
mums
said
is
it
funny
joey
remarked
blissfully
it
like
the
house
that
jack
built
all
going
back
and
back
if
i
had
wanted
the
scholarship
i
would
have
come
to
redlands
and
if
miss
craigie
had
had
i
should
have
travelled
with
her
and
noreen
would
have
ragged
me
about
the
lab
and
i
should
have
found
out
about
the
violet
handkerchief
and
if
gracie
had
been
like
she
is
now
john
have
taught
me
signalling
and
i
should
have
come
back
alone
and
if
noreen
and
gabrielle
had
been
such
bricks
and
waited
for
me
at
the
reservoir
yes
interrupted
father
and
if
my
eldest
daughter
had
been
out
to
keep
her
promise
like
an
englishman
and
take
care
of
mums
i
suppose
she
would
have
fagged
for
the
scholarship
and
then
there
would
have
been
no
beginning

very
glorious
