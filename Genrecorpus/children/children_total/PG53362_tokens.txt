leon
you
will
take
in
everybody
don
t
leave
a
single
man
out
for
we
want
them
all
there
at
this
secessionists
as
well
as
union
men
yes
of
course
i
had
a
talk
with
nathan
knight
last
night
and
he
says
everybody
must
be
informed
of
the
fact
we
are
going
to
secede
from
the
state
of
mississippi
and
get
up
a
government
of
our
own
and
he
declares
that
everybody
must
be
told
of
i
tell
you
dad
we
ve
got
a
mighty
poor
show
i
suppose
there
are
at
least
two
thousand
fighting
men
say
fifteen
hundred
and
they
are
all
good
shots
and
jeff
davis
has
called
out
a
hundred
thousand
men
where
would
we
be
if
he
would
send
that
number
of
men
after
us
he
ain
t
to
send
no
hundred
thousand
men
after
us
he
has
other
work
for
them
to
do
and
when
the
few
he
does
send
come
here
in
search
of
us
he
won
t
find
hide
nor
hair
of
a
living
man
in
the
it
was
sprague
who
spoke
last
and
his
words
were
addressed
to
his
son
leon
they
both
of
them
stood
leaning
on
their
horses
and
were
equipped
for
long
rides
in
opposite
directions
just
inside
the
gate
was
a
woman
leaning
upon
it
but
although
she
was
a
southerner
she
did
not
shed
tears
when
she
saw
leon
and
his
father
about
to
start
on
their
perilous
ride
for
she
knew
that
every
step
of
the
way
would
be
harassed
by
danger
and
if
she
saw
either
one
of
them
after
she
bade
them
it
would
all
be
owing
to
fortunate
man≈ìuvres
on
their
part
rather
than
to
any
mismanagement
on
the
part
of
the
rebels
they
were
both
known
as
strong
union
men
and
no
doubt
there
were
some
of
their
neighbors
who
were
determined
that
they
should
not
fulfil
their
errand
it
would
be
an
easy
matter
to
shoot
them
down
and
throw
their
bodies
into
the
swamp
and
no
one
would
be
the
wiser
for
it
leon
sprague
was
sixteen
years
old
and
had
been
a
raftsman
all
his
life
he
had
but
little
education
but
much
common
sense
for
schools
were
something
that
did
not
hold
a
high
place
in
jones
county
in
fact
there
had
been
but
one
school
in
the
county
since
he
could
remember
and
some
of
the
boys
took
charge
of
that
and
conducted
themselves
in
a
manner
that
drove
the
teacher
away
leon
was
a
fine
specimen
of
a
boy
as
he
stood
there
listening
to
his
father
s
beyond
his
years
and
straight
as
one
of
the
numerous
pines
that
he
had
so
often
felled
and
rafted
to
pascagoula
bay
his
countenance
was
frank
and
one
ever
thought
of
doubting
leon
s
just
now
there
was
a
scowl
upon
it
as
he
listened
to
what
his
father
had
to
say
to
him
these
people
the
spragues
were
a
little
better
off
than
most
of
those
who
followed
their
occupation
owning
a
nice
little
farm
four
negroes
and
a
patch
of
from
which
they
cut
their
logs
and
rafted
them
down
to
to
furnish
the
masts
for
vessels
his
father
and
mother
were
folks
who
thought
they
had
everything
that
was
worth
living
for
and
they
did
not
want
to
see
the
government
broken
up
on
any
pretext
the
negro
men
worked
the
farm
and
their
wives
were
busy
in
the
house
which
they
kept
as
neat
as
a
new
pin
just
now
the
men
had
been
butchering
hogs
in
the
woods
and
were
at
work
making
hams
and
bacon
of
them
these
negroes
did
not
have
an
did
not
know
what
it
was
they
went
about
their
work
bright
and
early
and
when
saturday
afternoon
came
they
posted
off
to
the
nearest
village
to
enjoy
their
they
loved
their
master
and
mistress
and
if
anybody
had
offered
them
their
freedom
they
would
not
have
taken
it
in
order
that
you
may
understand
this
story
boy
reader
it
is
necessary
that
you
should
know
something
of
the
character
of
the
inhabitants
and
be
able
to
bear
in
mind
the
nature
of
the
country
in
which
this
rebellion
in
dixie
took
place
for
it
was
as
much
of
a
rebellion
as
that
in
georgia
tennessee
north
carolina
and
missouri
where
men
were
shot
and
hanged
for
not
believing
as
their
neighbors
did
and
their
houses
were
set
on
fire
they
made
up
their
minds
at
the
early
as
they
would
not
furnish
any
men
for
the
southern
army
and
furthermore
they
took
good
care
to
see
that
there
was
no
drafting
done
in
their
county
if
you
will
take
your
atlas
and
turn
to
the
map
of
mississippi
you
will
find
jones
county
in
the
southeastern
part
of
the
state
and
about
miles
north
of
mobile
a
port
that
was
one
of
the
last
to
be
captured
by
the
united
states
army
it
comprised
nearly
twenty
townships
the
white
population
being
a
small
chance
one
would
think
for
people
to
live
as
they
did
for
almost
two
years
the
land
was
not
fertile
the
entire
region
being
made
up
of
pine
barrens
and
swamps
traversed
by
winding
creeks
bordered
by
almost
impenetrable
it
was
bounded
on
four
sides
by
jasper
wayne
perry
and
covington
counties
which
were
all
loyal
to
the
confederacy
and
it
would
seem
that
the
people
had
undertaken
an
immense
job
to
carry
on
a
rebellion
here
in
the
face
of
such
surroundings
the
inhabitants
were
almost
to
a
man
opposed
to
the
war
they
were
lumbermen
who
earned
a
precarious
living
by
cutting
the
pine
trees
and
rafting
them
to
which
at
that
time
was
found
on
pascagoula
bay
they
had
everything
that
lumbermen
could
ask
for
and
they
did
not
think
that
any
effort
to
cut
themselves
loose
from
the
north
would
result
in
any
glory
to
them
they
could
not
get
any
more
for
their
timber
than
they
were
getting
now
and
why
should
they
consent
to
go
into
the
army
and
fight
for
principles
that
they
knew
nothing
about
of
course
this
county
was
divided
against
itself
as
every
other
county
was
that
laid
claim
to
some
union
and
some
confederate
inhabitants
there
were
men
among
them
who
had
their
all
invested
there
and
they
did
not
think
these
earnest
people
were
pursuing
the
right
course
these
were
the
secessionists
but
they
were
very
careful
about
what
they
said
although
they
afterward
found
opportunities
to
put
their
ideas
into
practice
when
general
lowery
was
sent
with
a
strong
force
to
crush
out
this
rebellion
he
was
met
by
a
stubborn
resistance
and
some
of
these
confederates
who
were
seen
and
recognized
by
their
union
neighbors
were
afterward
shot
to
pay
them
for
the
part
they
had
carried
out
in
conducting
the
enemy
to
their
place
of
retreat
taken
altogether
it
was
such
a
thing
as
nobody
had
ever
heard
of
before
but
the
way
these
lumbermen
went
about
it
proclaimed
what
manner
of
men
they
were
it
seemed
as
if
the
confederacy
could
run
enough
men
in
there
to
wipe
out
the
jones
county
republic
before
they
could
have
time
to
organize
their
army
but
for
all
that
the
inhabitants
were
determined
to
go
through
with
it
they
held
many
a
long
talk
with
one
another
when
they
met
on
the
road
or
in
convention
at
ellisville
and
there
wasn
t
a
man
who
was
in
favor
of
joining
the
confederacy
the
secessionists
wisely
keeping
out
of
sight
things
went
on
in
this
way
for
a
year
or
more
during
which
the
lumbermen
talked
amazingly
but
did
nothing
finally
fort
sumter
was
fired
upon
and
afterward
came
the
disastrous
battle
of
bull
run
and
then
the
confederates
began
to
gain
a
little
courage
they
knew
the
south
was
going
to
whip
and
these
battles
confirmed
them
in
the
belief
but
the
raftsmen
did
not
believe
it
in
when
the
confederate
congress
passed
the
act
of
conscription
which
compelled
those
liable
to
do
military
duty
to
serve
in
the
army
the
lumbermen
grew
in
earnest
and
a
few
of
them
got
together
in
ellisville
and
talked
the
matter
over
the
market
for
their
logs
had
long
ago
been
broken
up
and
some
of
them
were
beginning
to
feel
the
need
of
something
to
eat
and
when
one
of
their
number
proposed
more
as
a
joke
than
anything
else
that
they
should
cast
their
fortunes
with
the
confederates
and
so
be
able
to
go
down
to
and
get
some
provisions
the
motion
was
hooted
down
in
short
order
there
were
not
enough
people
there
to
hold
a
convention
and
so
the
matter
was
postponed
some
of
the
wealthy
ones
who
owned
horses
being
selected
to
ride
about
the
county
and
inform
every
one
that
the
matter
had
gone
far
they
were
going
to
hold
a
meeting
and
see
what
the
lumbermen
thought
of
taking
the
county
out
of
the
state
of
mississippi
leon
and
his
father
were
two
of
those
chosen
and
they
were
just
getting
ready
to
start
on
their
journey
i
don
t
know
as
i
ought
to
send
that
boy
out
at
all
mary
said
sprague
when
he
arrived
at
home
that
night
after
the
convention
had
been
decided
upon
i
have
never
seen
leon
in
trouble
and
i
don
t
know
how
he
will
act
but
the
boys
down
to
ellisville
seemed
determined
to
let
him
go
and
i
never
said
a
word
about
i
think
you
have
seen
leon
in
trouble
a
half
a
dozen
times
said
his
wife
who
was
prompt
to
side
with
her
son
the
time
that
tom
howe
came
so
near
being
smashed
up
with
those
logs
down
there
in
the
guess
he
was
in
trouble
then
wasn
t
he
but
that
was
with
logs
it
wasn
t
with
men
said
sprague
yes
leon
was
pretty
plucky
that
day
and
when
all
the
boys
cheered
him
i
didn
t
say
a
word
although
i
had
an
awkward
feeling
of
pride
around
my
heart
i
tell
leon
and
three
or
four
other
fellows
of
light
build
were
frequently
called
upon
to
start
a
jam
of
logs
which
had
filled
up
the
stream
so
full
that
the
timber
could
not
move
a
hasty
glance
at
the
jam
would
show
them
the
log
that
was
to
blame
for
it
and
armed
with
an
ax
and
the
boys
would
leap
upon
the
raft
and
go
out
to
it
a
few
hasty
blows
would
start
the
jam
and
the
timber
rushing
by
with
the
speed
of
a
lightning
express
train
the
boys
would
make
their
way
back
to
the
shore
jumping
from
one
log
to
another
sometimes
they
did
not
get
back
without
a
ducking
on
the
occasion
referred
to
tom
went
out
alone
and
after
he
had
been
there
some
minutes
without
starting
the
jam
leon
was
sent
out
to
assist
him
two
axes
were
better
than
one
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
timber
was
started
it
came
with
a
rush
too
but
tom
was
just
a
moment
too
late
the
log
upon
which
he
had
been
chopping
shot
up
into
the
air
fully
twenty
feet
and
when
it
came
down
it
struck
the
log
on
which
tom
was
standing
and
soused
him
head
over
heels
in
the
water
but
before
he
went
he
felt
somebody
s
around
him
it
was
leon
sprague
s
arm
for
the
latter
struck
the
water
almost
as
soon
as
he
did
leon
came
up
a
moment
afterward
with
tom
hanging
limp
and
lifeless
in
his
arms
and
heard
the
cheers
of
the
boys
ringing
in
his
ears
but
had
to
go
down
again
to
escape
the
onward
rush
of
the
logs
which
were
coming
toward
him
with
almost
railroad
speed
by
going
down
in
this
way
and
swimming
lustily
whenever
the
logs
were
far
enough
away
to
admit
of
it
leon
succeeded
in
landing
about
half
a
mile
below
and
hauling
his
senseless
burden
out
on
the
bank
tom
could
were
few
boys
on
the
stream
that
could
beat
him
at
when
that
log
came
down
on
him
it
well
nigh
knocked
it
all
out
leon
s
father
never
said
a
word
he
walked
up
and
gave
the
boy
s
hand
a
hearty
shake
and
that
was
the
last
of
it
leon
had
the
opportunity
of
knowing
as
soon
as
tom
came
to
himself
that
he
had
made
a
friend
by
his
last
s
operations
jeff
davis
ain
t
a
going
to
send
no
hundred
thousand
men
after
us
repeated
sprague
preparing
to
mount
his
horse
he
ll
send
a
few
in
here
to
break
up
this
rebellion
and
when
they
get
here
we
ll
be
in
the
woods
out
of
sight
kiss
your
mother
leon
and
let
s
go
we
have
got
a
good
ways
to
ride
before
now
leon
be
careful
of
yourself
said
his
mother
you
need
have
no
fear
of
me
said
leon
leaving
his
horse
and
going
up
to
the
gate
i
ve
got
my
revolver
in
my
pocket
all
but
remember
that
when
you
are
riding
along
the
road
somebody
can
easily
pick
you
off
said
sprague
you
know
you
are
a
union
do
you
want
me
to
make
believe
that
i
am
confederate
by
no
means
stick
to
the
union
the
farewells
being
said
father
and
son
got
upon
their
horses
and
rode
away
in
opposite
directions
leon
rode
a
was
fond
of
a
good
animal
and
he
owned
one
of
the
very
best
in
the
he
allowed
him
to
wander
at
his
own
gait
knowing
that
the
horse
would
be
tired
enough
when
he
returned
home
as
he
rode
along
thinking
how
foolish
the
people
were
to
consider
seriously
the
proposal
to
withdraw
from
the
union
he
ran
against
a
boy
about
his
own
age
who
like
himself
was
journeying
on
horseback
he
was
a
boy
he
did
not
like
to
see
he
was
awfully
stuck
up
and
furthermore
he
was
a
rebel
and
did
not
hesitate
to
have
his
opinions
known
hello
leon
exclaimed
carl
swayne
for
that
was
the
boy
s
name
where
are
you
going
this
morning
i
am
going
around
to
see
every
man
in
this
side
of
the
county
said
leon
we
are
going
to
get
up
a
convention
on
the
and
we
want
everybody
there
the
convention
is
going
to
be
held
at
by
george
has
it
come
to
that
cried
carl
flourishing
his
in
the
air
what
do
you
think
you
are
going
to
do
after
you
get
to
that
convention
we
are
going
to
dissolve
the
union
existing
between
this
county
and
the
state
of
yes
i
ll
bet
you
will
how
long
will
it
be
before
the
confederates
will
send
men
in
here
to
whip
you
out
you
must
think
you
can
stand
against
i
don
t
think
we
can
stand
against
anybody
said
leon
if
the
confederates
come
in
here
we
shall
go
into
the
well
it
won
t
take
me
long
to
show
them
where
you
are
said
carl
savagely
i
was
talking
with
uncle
about
it
last
night
and
he
says
you
haven
t
got
but
a
few
fighting
men
here
and
that
it
is
utterly
preposterous
for
you
to
think
of
getting
up
a
rebellion
i
know
one
thing
about
it
you
will
all
be
and
i
know
another
thing
about
it
said
leon
when
it
comes
we
ll
be
in
good
company
will
you
be
down
to
our
convention
not
as
anybody
knows
of
replied
carl
with
a
laugh
i
ll
get
somebody
up
here
to
put
a
stop
to
well
i
wouldn
t
be
too
hasty
about
it
you
may
get
hanged
yes
i
d
like
to
see
the
man
living
that
can
put
a
rope
around
my
neck
exclaimed
carl
hotly
i
ve
got
more
friends
in
this
county
than
one
would
suppose
i
ll
bet
you
wouldn
t
be
one
of
the
first
to
do
leon
picked
up
his
reins
and
went
on
without
answering
this
question
he
saw
that
carl
was
in
a
fair
way
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
him
and
he
had
no
desire
to
keep
up
his
end
of
it
carl
was
and
when
he
got
mad
was
apt
to
do
and
say
some
things
that
any
boy
of
his
age
ought
to
have
been
ashamed
of
he
kept
on
down
the
road
for
a
mile
further
and
finally
turned
into
a
broad
that
led
up
to
a
neat
little
cottage
that
was
surrounded
by
shade
trees
on
all
sides
this
was
the
house
of
crusty
old
bachelor
who
had
always
taken
a
deep
interest
in
leon
he
was
union
to
the
backbone
and
if
he
could
have
had
his
way
he
would
have
made
short
work
with
all
such
fellows
as
carl
swayne
he
was
sitting
out
on
the
porch
indulging
in
a
smoke
hallo
leon
he
cried
as
soon
as
he
found
out
who
the
was
alight
and
i
can
t
do
it
smith
replied
leon
i
am
bound
to
see
every
man
in
this
part
of
the
county
and
that
you
know
is
a
good
long
ride
we
are
going
to
hold
a
convention
on
the
and
we
want
you
to
come
down
to
whew
whistled
smith
you
bet
i
ll
be
there
what
are
you
going
to
do
at
that
convention
leon
explained
briefly
adding
i
just
now
saw
a
fellow
whom
i
asked
to
come
down
and
he
positively
declined
he
says
he
will
get
somebody
to
put
a
stop
to
that
s
carl
swayne
said
smith
in
a
tone
of
disgust
say
i
will
give
half
my
fortune
if
we
can
hang
that
fellow
and
his
uncle
to
the
nearest
tree
they
have
been
preaching
up
secessionists
doctrines
here
till
you
can
t
i
think
we
can
get
the
better
of
them
after
a
while
said
leon
when
did
you
get
back
he
added
for
smith
had
been
down
to
to
see
what
was
going
on
there
did
you
see
or
hear
anything
in
mobile
i
got
back
last
night
there
is
nothing
in
mobile
except
fortifications
i
tell
you
it
will
require
a
big
army
to
take
that
place
by
the
way
leon
i
want
to
see
you
some
time
all
by
yourself
don
t
let
any
one
know
you
are
coming
here
but
just
i
ll
remember
it
smith
you
won
t
forget
the
convention
what
in
the
world
does
the
old
fellow
want
to
see
me
for
soliloquized
leon
and
why
couldn
t
he
have
told
me
as
well
as
any
other
time
well
it
can
t
be
much
any
leon
kept
on
his
ride
and
before
night
he
was
many
miles
from
home
he
took
in
every
house
he
came
to
union
as
well
as
secessionist
and
while
the
former
greeted
him
cordially
the
rebels
had
something
to
say
to
him
that
fairly
took
his
breath
away
if
he
hadn
t
been
the
most
fellow
in
the
world
he
would
have
got
fighting
mad
they
all
agreed
as
to
one
thing
they
were
going
to
see
leon
hanged
for
carrying
around
the
notice
of
that
convention
his
neighbors
wouldn
t
do
it
but
there
would
be
plenty
of
confederates
in
there
after
a
while
that
would
string
the
union
people
up
as
fast
as
they
could
get
to
them
leon
had
no
idea
that
there
were
so
many
secessionists
in
the
county
as
he
found
there
when
he
came
to
ride
through
it
and
he
made
up
his
mind
to
one
thing
and
that
was
it
was
going
to
be
pretty
hard
work
to
carry
that
county
out
of
the
state
but
just
wait
until
we
get
together
and
decide
upon
a
constitution
said
leon
as
he
rode
along
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
eyes
fastened
upon
the
horn
of
his
saddle
jeff
davis
has
long
ago
ordered
all
union
men
out
of
the
confederacy
and
what
is
there
to
hinder
us
from
ordering
all
these
rebels
out
that
s
an
idea
and
i
will
speak
to
father
about
leon
did
not
care
to
spend
all
night
with
such
people
as
these
and
so
he
kept
on
until
he
found
a
family
whose
sentiments
agreed
with
his
own
and
there
he
laid
by
until
morning
the
head
of
this
household
had
but
recently
come
into
the
county
and
leon
did
not
know
him
when
the
latter
rode
up
to
the
bars
the
man
was
chopping
wood
in
front
of
a
dilapidated
shanty
but
when
he
saw
leon
approaching
he
dropped
his
axe
took
long
strides
toward
his
door
and
turned
around
and
faced
him
the
boy
certainly
thought
he
was
acting
in
a
very
strange
way
and
for
a
moment
didn
t
know
whether
he
was
a
union
man
or
a
rebel
good
evening
sir
said
leon
who
thought
he
might
as
well
settle
the
matter
once
for
all
can
i
stay
all
night
with
you
who
are
you
and
where
did
you
come
from
asked
the
man
in
reply
my
name
is
leon
sprague
and
i
live
in
the
other
part
of
the
county
replied
leon
i
am
a
union
boy
all
over
and
i
came
out
to
tell
course
we
can
keep
you
all
night
if
that
is
the
kind
of
a
boy
you
are
replied
the
man
coming
up
to
the
bars
get
off
and
turn
your
horse
loose
i
haven
t
seen
a
union
boy
before
in
a
long
while
i
came
from
what
are
you
doing
down
here
asked
leon
as
he
led
his
horse
over
the
bars
i
came
down
here
to
get
out
of
reach
of
the
rebels
em
said
the
man
in
a
passionate
tone
of
voice
you
had
just
ought
to
see
them
up
there
they
have
got
their
jails
full
they
are
hanging
men
for
burning
bridges
and
when
i
left
home
there
was
two
or
three
thousand
men
going
over
the
mountains
into
kentucky
but
i
couldn
t
go
with
them
the
rebels
cut
me
off
and
as
i
was
bound
to
go
somewhere
i
came
on
down
leon
had
by
this
time
taken
the
saddle
and
bridle
from
his
horse
and
turned
him
loose
to
get
his
own
supper
then
he
backed
up
against
the
fence
and
watched
the
man
chopping
his
wood
chapter
ii
the
convention
what
made
you
start
for
the
house
when
you
saw
me
coming
up
said
leon
as
the
man
sank
his
axe
deep
into
the
log
on
which
he
was
chopping
and
paused
to
moisten
his
hands
because
i
thought
you
was
a
rebel
i
reckoned
there
was
more
coming
behind
you
and
i
wanted
to
be
pretty
close
to
my
rifle
i
didn
t
know
that
i
had
got
into
a
community
of
union
folks
down
leon
was
astonished
to
hear
the
man
converse
he
talked
like
an
intelligent
person
and
the
boy
was
glad
to
have
him
express
an
opinion
for
it
was
so
much
better
than
his
own
that
he
resolved
to
profit
by
it
i
don
t
know
that
you
got
in
among
union
people
said
leon
for
i
have
seen
more
rebels
than
i
thought
there
was
in
the
county
but
all
the
same
there
are
some
union
folks
here
you
might
have
gone
further
and
fared
so
i
believe
when
you
came
up
you
said
you
were
out
to
tell
everybody
something
what
were
you
going
to
say
it
didn
t
take
leon
more
than
two
minutes
to
explain
himself
the
man
listened
with
genuine
amazement
and
when
the
boy
got
through
he
seated
himself
on
the
log
and
rested
his
elbows
on
his
knees
how
are
you
going
to
take
this
county
out
said
he
you
haven
t
got
men
enough
to
do
any
no
sir
but
we
are
going
to
do
the
best
we
can
with
what
we
have
that
s
plucky
at
any
rate
i
suppose
that
if
the
rebels
come
in
here
to
capture
you
you
will
take
to
the
yes
sir
that
s
just
what
we
intend
to
well
sir
you
can
put
my
name
down
for
that
convention
said
the
man
getting
upon
his
feet
and
going
to
work
upon
his
i
ve
got
so
down
on
the
rebels
that
i
am
willing
to
do
anything
i
can
to
bother
them
i
ve
got
two
brothers
in
jail
up
there
you
said
something
about
bridge
burning
said
leon
and
he
didn
t
know
whether
he
made
a
mistake
or
not
perhaps
you
had
a
hand
in
perhaps
i
did
answered
the
man
with
a
laugh
and
i
tell
you
i
had
to
dig
out
as
soon
as
i
got
home
so
you
see
i
dare
not
go
back
what
s
the
punishment
death
answered
the
man
and
they
don
t
give
you
any
time
to
say
to
your
friends
they
don
t
even
you
but
string
you
up
at
the
man
said
this
in
much
the
same
tone
that
he
would
have
asked
for
a
drink
of
water
leon
was
surprised
that
one
who
had
passed
through
so
many
dangers
as
that
man
had
could
speak
of
it
so
indifferently
but
then
he
looked
like
a
man
who
would
have
been
picked
out
of
a
crowd
to
engage
in
business
of
that
kind
he
was
large
and
bony
the
ease
with
which
he
handled
his
axe
was
surprising
but
his
face
was
one
to
attract
anybody
s
attention
it
was
a
determined
face
that
wouldn
t
back
down
for
any
obstacles
if
the
union
men
in
tennessee
were
all
like
him
it
was
a
wonder
how
the
rebels
got
the
start
of
them
i
can
t
give
you
as
good
a
place
here
as
i
could
at
home
said
the
man
as
his
wife
came
to
the
door
and
told
him
that
supper
was
ready
at
home
i
have
a
commodious
house
and
you
could
have
a
room
in
it
all
to
yourself
here
i
have
nothing
but
this
little
shanty
to
go
into
it
leaks
but
i
will
soon
get
the
better
of
that
molly
this
young
man
is
union
all
over
and
he
has
come
down
here
to
tell
of
a
convention
that
is
to
be
held
at
ellisville
to
take
this
county
out
of
the
state
whoever
heard
of
such
a
thing
i
am
going
to
that
meeting
sure
his
wife
was
greatly
surprised
to
listen
to
this
but
she
accepted
the
introduction
to
leon
and
forthwith
proceeded
to
make
him
feel
at
home
there
were
two
children
but
they
had
been
taught
to
behave
and
did
not
try
to
shove
themselves
forward
at
all
taken
altogether
it
was
a
comfortable
meal
and
before
it
was
over
leon
learned
some
things
regarding
this
man
that
he
wouldn
t
have
believed
possible
he
had
come
all
the
way
through
the
rebel
state
of
mississippi
by
telling
the
people
he
met
on
the
way
that
he
was
going
to
see
some
friends
and
had
by
chance
struck
jones
county
the
very
place
of
all
others
he
wanted
to
be
i
must
confess
it
was
pretty
pokerish
sometimes
said
the
man
the
rebels
had
sent
on
a
description
of
me
as
the
man
who
helped
burn
their
bridges
and
now
and
then
i
had
to
get
under
the
bundles
of
clothing
and
cover
myself
up
there
leaving
my
wife
to
guide
the
horses
but
i
had
my
rifle
all
right
and
it
would
have
gone
hard
with
the
men
who
discovered
the
evening
was
passed
in
this
way
listening
to
the
man
s
stories
and
when
leon
went
to
bed
in
a
dark
corner
of
the
room
he
told
himself
that
he
had
got
into
a
desperate
scrape
and
that
he
had
got
something
to
do
in
order
to
get
out
of
it
he
had
never
dreamed
that
men
could
be
down
on
their
neighbors
in
that
way
and
here
this
man
had
all
he
could
do
to
keep
from
being
shot
by
george
i
tell
you
we
are
in
for
it
said
leon
pulling
the
blankets
up
over
him
and
i
don
t
know
how
we
are
going
to
come
out
there
are
rebels
all
around
us
and
if
they
are
as
bad
down
here
as
they
are
up
in
tennessee
there
won
t
one
of
us
come
through
alive
but
i
am
armed
and
i
ll
see
that
some
of
them
get
as
good
as
they
it
was
daylight
when
leon
awoke
and
after
washing
his
hands
and
face
in
a
basin
outside
the
door
he
stood
in
front
of
the
fireplace
before
which
the
woman
was
engaged
in
cooking
the
breakfast
and
looked
up
at
the
man
s
rifle
which
hung
on
some
wooden
pegs
over
the
mantel
it
was
an
ordinary
thing
and
didn
t
look
as
though
it
had
been
the
death
of
anybody
that
rifle
has
been
too
much
for
half
a
dozen
men
said
the
woman
why
how
did
that
happen
asked
leon
it
happened
when
they
came
to
burn
us
out
answered
the
woman
they
came
one
night
and
tried
to
call
josiah
to
the
door
but
he
would
not
go
he
took
his
rifle
down
but
he
wouldn
t
shoot
until
they
did
and
as
he
is
a
good
shot
he
hit
every
time
the
next
day
we
had
to
move
for
they
came
with
a
larger
body
of
there
is
one
thing
that
makes
me
think
you
are
in
a
bad
place
said
leon
you
are
right
here
close
to
the
river
which
separates
the
two
counties
and
if
anybody
makes
a
raid
over
here
they
will
strike
you
sure
i
think
if
that
convention
is
held
you
had
better
come
down
to
our
place
we
have
room
enough
there
to
stow
you
oh
thank
you
perhaps
you
had
better
speak
to
josiah
about
josiah
was
out
attending
to
his
horses
and
cow
and
leon
went
out
to
him
he
looked
at
him
with
more
respect
than
he
did
the
night
before
for
in
addition
to
burning
the
bridges
he
had
got
the
better
of
half
a
dozen
men
he
bade
leon
a
hearty
but
the
boy
noticed
that
all
the
while
he
kept
talking
to
him
he
kept
his
eyes
fastened
on
the
woods
probably
it
was
from
the
force
of
habit
he
agreed
with
leon
that
they
were
in
a
bad
place
to
meet
raids
and
promised
that
after
the
convention
came
off
he
would
see
what
he
could
do
he
didn
t
want
to
trespass
on
anybody
until
he
had
to
breakfast
over
leon
brought
his
horse
to
the
door
put
on
his
saddle
and
bridle
and
bid
to
the
family
from
tennessee
and
rode
off
he
was
two
days
more
on
his
route
and
on
the
third
day
he
turned
his
horse
toward
home
he
reached
it
without
any
mishap
and
his
mother
was
glad
to
see
him
judging
by
the
hug
she
gave
him
his
father
had
arrived
the
night
before
but
the
stories
he
had
to
tell
didn
t
compare
with
leon
s
of
course
his
mother
was
shocked
when
she
learned
that
josiah
leon
did
not
know
what
else
to
call
him
had
shot
so
many
men
before
he
left
tennessee
but
she
readily
agreed
to
shelter
his
wife
and
children
i
never
thought
to
ask
him
his
name
said
leon
but
i
will
ask
him
down
to
the
convention
he
was
dead
in
favor
of
it
and
said
he
would
be
there
i
tell
you
that
man
has
passed
through
a
heap
he
couldn
t
talk
to
me
without
running
his
eyes
over
the
woods
to
see
if
there
was
anybody
on
the
next
day
but
one
was
the
time
of
the
convention
and
at
an
early
hour
sprague
and
leon
mounted
their
horses
and
set
out
for
ellisville
on
the
way
they
picked
up
a
good
many
more
both
afoot
and
on
horseback
and
by
the
time
they
reached
their
destination
they
numbered
fifty
or
more
they
made
their
way
at
once
to
the
church
and
found
themselves
surrounded
by
a
formidable
body
of
men
all
of
whom
were
armed
with
rifles
there
must
have
been
a
thousand
men
there
and
there
was
not
a
secessionist
to
be
seen
in
the
party
shortly
afterward
nathan
knight
arrived
he
bid
to
the
people
right
and
left
and
went
into
the
church
whither
he
was
followed
by
all
the
building
would
hold
those
who
couldn
t
get
in
raised
the
windows
on
the
outside
and
settled
themselves
down
to
hear
what
was
going
to
happen
nathan
knight
was
a
large
man
with
gray
whiskers
and
an
eye
that
seemed
to
look
right
through
you
but
for
all
that
his
face
was
kindly
and
if
you
got
broken
up
in
business
and
wanted
help
nathan
knight
was
the
man
to
go
to
he
took
his
seat
in
the
pulpit
just
where
he
knew
the
folks
would
send
him
took
off
his
hat
and
drew
his
handkerchief
across
his
forehead
his
meeting
was
not
conducted
according
to
order
but
those
who
were
there
understood
it
gentlemen
will
please
come
to
order
said
he
are
there
any
of
us
who
are
opposed
to
taking
this
county
out
of
the
state
of
mississippi
if
there
is
let
him
now
speak
or
hereafter
hold
his
each
man
gazed
into
the
face
of
his
neighbor
but
each
one
knew
that
the
one
he
looked
at
was
as
much
in
favor
of
secession
as
he
was
himself
finally
some
one
in
the
back
part
of
the
church
called
out
nathan
there
ain
t
nary
a
rebel
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
said
knight
but
there
are
some
around
in
the
county
and
you
want
to
be
careful
how
you
deal
with
them
i
will
now
appoint
a
committee
of
six
to
draw
up
a
series
of
resolutions
of
secession
they
will
go
over
to
the
hotel
and
come
back
when
they
get
knight
had
evidently
been
thinking
of
this
matter
before
for
he
appointed
the
committee
without
hesitation
and
among
them
was
the
name
of
sprague
they
were
all
men
who
would
not
say
a
thing
they
did
not
mean
and
as
they
were
about
to
go
out
the
president
beckoned
sprague
to
his
desk
and
placed
a
piece
of
paper
in
his
hands
there
s
some
resolutions
i
drew
up
after
thinking
the
matter
over
said
he
perhaps
it
will
serve
as
a
model
to
you
you
can
amend
them
or
leave
them
out
entirely
as
suits
you
when
the
committee
had
retired
knight
got
up
and
for
the
next
proceeded
to
arraign
the
confederate
states
and
praise
the
union
his
remarks
calling
forth
loud
and
applause
he
took
the
ground
that
it
was
a
geographical
impossibility
to
conquer
jones
county
because
the
inhabitants
being
lumbermen
it
would
be
easy
for
them
to
slip
into
the
woods
and
when
there
nobody
but
a
raftsman
could
find
them
he
kept
his
speech
going
until
the
committee
were
seen
coming
back
sprague
made
his
way
to
the
desk
and
amid
the
most
impressive
silence
read
the
resolutions
of
secession
as
follows
whereas
the
state
of
mississippi
has
seen
fit
to
withdraw
from
the
federal
union
for
reasons
which
appear
justifiable
we
the
citizens
of
jones
county
claim
the
same
right
thinking
our
grievances
are
sufficient
by
reason
of
an
unjust
law
passed
by
congress
of
the
confederate
states
of
america
forcing
us
to
go
to
distant
parts
etc
be
it
that
we
sever
the
union
heretofore
existing
between
jones
county
and
the
state
of
mississippi
and
proclaim
our
independence
of
said
state
and
the
confederate
states
of
america
and
we
solemnly
call
upon
almighty
god
to
witness
and
bless
such
act
when
sprague
ceased
reading
the
applause
which
shook
the
building
was
long
and
loud
not
satisfied
with
that
some
of
the
raftsmen
fired
off
their
guns
and
for
the
next
five
or
ten
minutes
it
was
impossible
to
do
anything
inside
the
church
by
that
time
the
excitement
had
somewhat
died
out
and
then
the
president
asked
if
there
was
any
debate
on
the
matter
but
no
one
had
anything
to
say
knowing
that
those
six
men
had
the
good
of
the
county
at
heart
there
was
not
one
who
had
anything
to
say
against
them
knight
expressed
himself
pleased
and
was
about
to
announce
that
the
resolutions
were
passed
when
somebody
on
the
outside
of
the
building
called
out
nathan
here
s
a
couple
of
rebels
out
what
are
they
doing
out
there
asked
the
president
in
surprise
i
don
t
know
they
have
just
come
up
here
it
looks
to
me
like
they
were
going
to
well
fetch
them
in
here
now
boys
not
a
word
out
of
you
i
will
do
the
talking
and
if
you
have
any
questions
to
ask
you
can
ask
them
but
don
t
all
talk
at
knight
settled
back
in
his
chair
and
the
most
profound
silence
ensued
finally
the
crowd
about
the
door
gave
way
as
the
rebels
and
their
escort
approached
and
the
confederates
seeing
so
many
men
standing
there
with
their
hats
all
off
courteously
took
off
their
own
they
kept
on
until
they
got
up
to
the
desk
and
then
knight
drew
up
chairs
for
them
to
be
seated
now
gentlemen
what
brought
you
up
here
asked
the
president
we
came
up
here
to
recruit
replied
the
ranking
officer
i
am
glad
to
see
so
many
of
you
here
for
it
will
save
us
the
trouble
of
hunting
you
will
you
be
kind
enough
to
read
that
said
knight
unfolding
the
paper
on
which
the
resolutions
were
written
and
passing
it
over
to
the
officer
the
official
took
the
paper
and
as
he
read
his
eyes
opened
with
surprise
when
he
had
got
through
with
it
he
passed
it
over
to
his
subordinate
and
then
turned
and
looked
at
the
men
near
him
he
was
satisfied
that
there
was
not
a
man
there
who
did
not
believe
every
word
of
those
resolutions
the
officer
had
nothing
to
fear
was
the
first
recruiting
official
that
ever
came
after
he
got
away
he
would
not
come
back
at
any
price
these
are
not
all
your
men
said
he
no
sir
we
have
not
more
than
three
hundred
men
but
these
extra
parties
have
come
in
with
their
families
at
odd
times
and
every
man
you
see
is
a
union
my
friend
you
are
making
a
great
mistake
began
the
officer
we
are
ready
to
stand
by
it
do
you
suppose
the
confederates
will
stand
by
and
allow
you
to
take
this
county
out
of
the
state
to
be
an
odd
sheep
in
the
flock
continued
the
officer
the
first
thing
you
know
you
will
be
overrun
with
men
and
you
won
t
have
a
house
to
go
what
will
we
be
doing
all
that
time
oh
i
suppose
you
will
fight
but
it
won
t
do
you
any
good
the
confederates
can
send
twenty
thousand
men
in
we
don
t
care
if
they
send
forty
thousand
replied
the
president
whatever
you
send
we
ll
the
men
who
were
crowded
in
the
church
and
gathered
about
the
windows
couldn
t
stand
it
any
longer
they
broke
out
into
loud
applause
which
continued
for
some
minutes
when
they
got
through
the
officer
evidently
thought
they
were
in
earnest
we
have
a
thousand
men
here
and
when
we
get
into
the
swamp
we
are
willing
to
meet
five
thousand
continued
knight
you
can
t
conquer
what
will
you
do
for
grub
we
ll
steal
it
shouted
one
of
the
men
and
the
answer
was
so
droll
and
corresponded
so
entirely
with
the
thoughts
of
the
men
who
were
standing
around
that
the
whole
assembly
burst
into
laughter
even
the
enrolling
officers
joined
in
i
suppose
you
can
do
that
of
course
said
he
but
supposing
the
escort
is
too
strong
to
be
successfully
attacked
we
don
t
borrow
any
trouble
on
that
score
said
knight
we
haven
t
got
all
the
men
we
are
going
to
have
you
see
how
they
are
coming
in
now
but
you
are
interrupting
us
and
we
shall
have
to
bid
you
you
see
very
plainly
that
you
can
t
raise
any
men
here
for
the
confederate
army
another
thing
we
ll
tell
you
you
are
the
first
to
come
in
and
you
will
be
the
last
to
go
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
will
kill
any
enrolling
officers
who
come
here
that
s
just
what
i
mean
to
say
we
don
t
want
them
well
said
the
official
rising
to
his
feet
we
ll
go
but
we
won
t
be
the
last
officers
to
come
in
here
i
will
tell
you
that
very
plainly
you
mustn
t
think
that
the
confederates
are
going
to
allow
you
to
have
your
own
way
in
this
matter
it
beats
anything
i
ever
heard
we
are
aware
of
that
and
that
s
what
makes
us
think
we
are
going
to
go
through
with
it
i
will
bid
you
the
men
divided
right
and
left
to
allow
the
rebels
a
chance
to
get
out
and
when
they
had
passed
out
beyond
the
door
the
president
proceeded
to
call
the
meeting
to
order
i
am
pleased
with
the
way
you
obeyed
my
commands
said
knight
if
you
will
obey
as
promptly
as
that
we
are
going
to
be
hard
to
whip
the
next
thing
is
to
elect
a
i
nominate
nathan
knight
as
president
of
the
jones
county
confederacy
shouted
a
man
near
the
door
we
ought
to
have
a
ballot
for
that
said
knight
we
don
t
need
no
ballot
it
takes
too
much
time
can
i
get
a
second
to
that
he
could
and
he
did
it
seemed
as
if
every
man
in
the
house
seconded
the
motion
sprague
put
the
vote
before
the
house
and
it
was
carried
unanimously
knight
did
not
stop
to
make
a
speech
but
said
the
next
vote
would
be
for
and
sprague
was
nominated
hold
on
there
shouted
a
voice
we
don
t
want
sprague
for
we
want
him
for
secretary
of
war
if
there
is
any
man
who
can
put
us
fellows
where
we
can
do
the
most
good
in
a
fight
sprague
is
the
and
so
it
was
all
through
the
convention
there
wasn
t
a
ballot
taken
for
anything
and
no
man
thought
of
declining
an
office
by
four
o
clock
the
work
was
all
done
and
then
knight
thought
of
something
else
there
is
one
thing
more
that
i
want
the
convention
to
decide
on
said
he
it
is
a
ticklish
piece
of
business
but
we
have
got
to
do
it
jeff
davis
has
been
making
things
very
uncomfortable
for
our
fellows
out
there
in
the
confederacy
by
telling
them
that
they
have
got
to
light
out
or
go
into
the
army
now
what
s
to
hinder
us
from
doing
the
same
thing
there
are
many
rebels
about
and
i
say
let
s
get
rid
of
them
said
a
voice
i
know
one
fellow
who
is
going
around
all
the
time
talking
secession
and
if
the
meeting
says
the
word
i
ll
go
to
him
and
tell
him
he
had
better
dig
out
the
county
will
be
a
heap
happier
if
he
ain
t
in
let
s
all
go
in
a
body
said
another
voice
that
s
what
i
say
said
a
chorus
of
half
a
dozen
men
i
think
myself
that
would
be
the
better
way
said
the
president
if
a
lot
of
us
get
together
and
call
upon
a
man
he
will
think
we
are
in
dead
earnest
give
them
time
to
take
what
they
want
and
then
escort
them
out
of
the
county
don
t
leave
a
rebel
behind
you
there
being
no
further
business
the
convention
stands
adjourned
to
meet
again
upon
and
where
was
leon
sprague
all
this
time
he
was
sitting
in
the
front
seat
where
he
could
hear
all
that
was
going
on
he
felt
proud
when
his
father
was
elected
secretary
of
war
he
supposed
of
course
that
it
was
his
business
to
post
men
in
battle
but
he
learned
better
after
a
while
he
was
particularly
anxious
about
escorting
the
rebels
out
of
the
county
and
as
soon
as
the
convention
adjourned
he
hurried
out
to
find
tom
howe
as
he
was
hurrying
through
the
door
whom
should
he
run
against
but
man
who
had
seen
a
heap
and
who
got
the
best
of
half
a
dozen
he
stood
with
his
rifle
hugged
up
close
to
him
as
if
it
were
an
old
friend
and
he
did
not
want
to
part
from
it
chapter
iii
a
word
in
your
why
josiah
i
am
glad
to
see
you
said
leon
advancing
and
shaking
hands
with
the
man
the
rebels
haven
t
raided
you
yet
look
here
what
is
your
name
i
forgot
to
ask
you
when
i
was
up
to
your
giddings
answered
the
man
no
the
rebels
have
not
raided
me
yet
but
i
am
mighty
dubious
about
well
i
want
to
make
you
acquainted
with
my
father
said
leon
he
will
give
your
wife
protection
at
his
house
we
have
a
negro
cabin
there
that
is
much
more
comfortable
than
the
one
you
live
in
now
for
it
doesn
t
leak
and
there
is
plenty
of
pasturage
there
for
your
horse
and
leon
drew
up
alongside
of
giddings
and
in
a
few
minutes
his
father
came
out
the
introduction
was
given
and
after
a
few
commonplace
remarks
sprague
inquired
how
he
liked
the
resolutions
they
ain
t
strong
enough
said
giddings
if
you
had
two
brothers
in
jail
waiting
for
their
i
reckon
you
would
put
in
more
language
than
you
where
is
that
inquired
knight
who
came
out
just
at
that
moment
up
in
tennessee
mountains
my
brothers
were
engaged
in
bridge
burning
and
now
they
have
got
to
suffer
death
for
leon
waited
just
long
enough
to
see
that
giddings
was
in
a
fair
way
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
the
principal
men
of
the
county
and
then
hastened
out
to
find
tom
howe
after
looking
all
about
he
discovered
him
sitting
under
the
shade
of
an
oak
eating
a
lunch
hallo
leon
have
some
was
the
way
in
which
he
greeted
the
it
s
mighty
good
i
tell
and
apple
a
person
to
look
at
your
lunch
wouldn
t
think
that
we
union
fellows
would
be
so
hard
up
for
grub
said
leon
seating
himself
on
the
ground
by
tom
s
side
you
heard
what
that
man
said
in
reply
to
the
enrolling
officer
that
if
we
got
short
of
provisions
we
would
steal
them
but
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
driving
those
rebels
away
from
i
know
one
who
will
get
out
of
the
county
with
once
telling
said
tom
who
is
it
carl
that
s
just
the
fellow
i
was
thinking
of
said
leon
spitefully
he
told
me
the
other
day
that
if
we
ran
into
the
swamp
it
would
not
take
him
long
to
show
them
where
we
and
he
told
me
that
he
wished
i
had
been
smashed
up
in
that
jam
while
i
was
about
it
for
then
there
would
be
one
union
man
less
in
the
world
said
tom
i
ll
never
forget
him
for
well
you
come
around
to
the
house
early
morning
and
we
will
go
up
and
send
him
off
i
see
father
is
getting
ready
to
go
home
so
i
must
go
leon
mounted
his
horse
and
started
on
a
lope
after
his
father
but
when
he
came
up
with
him
he
found
him
surrounded
by
a
lot
of
men
and
boys
who
were
talking
loudly
of
the
secession
resolutions
finding
no
end
of
fault
with
the
confederate
government
and
praising
the
union
they
won
t
get
me
no
matter
which
way
they
turn
said
one
of
the
men
who
lived
away
off
in
the
swamp
i
live
two
miles
from
everybody
and
right
there
is
where
the
fight
is
going
to
take
place
the
river
in
front
of
my
house
is
so
narrow
that
you
can
throw
a
stone
across
it
anywhere
and
for
a
mile
above
and
below
the
house
it
spreads
out
into
a
swamp
that
they
couldn
t
get
across
to
save
their
so
you
really
think
there
is
going
to
be
a
fight
do
you
inquired
sprague
oh
sure
it
s
just
as
that
enrolling
officer
said
the
confederates
ain
t
to
leave
us
to
be
the
black
sheep
in
the
flock
we
are
going
to
see
some
fun
before
we
get
through
with
that
was
the
opinion
of
all
the
men
and
they
concluded
too
that
the
best
place
to
hold
the
fight
would
be
right
there
in
front
of
this
man
s
house
but
i
ll
tell
you
what
s
a
fact
said
giddings
you
will
have
to
look
out
for
your
wife
and
children
the
rebels
will
make
short
work
of
them
if
they
get
hold
of
the
swamp
is
big
said
the
man
if
they
get
out
in
there
i
will
risk
the
rebels
getting
hold
of
then
men
and
boys
dropped
off
one
after
the
other
when
they
came
to
the
that
led
to
their
homes
and
by
the
time
sprague
reached
his
home
there
were
but
few
men
besides
giddings
left
the
latter
got
off
his
horse
at
the
gate
and
went
in
to
take
a
view
of
the
cabin
in
which
sprague
told
him
he
could
live
until
the
trouble
was
all
over
and
he
straightway
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
a
much
better
house
than
the
one
he
now
occupied
you
see
there
was
nobody
there
to
tell
me
that
i
could
go
into
that
house
or
i
could
stay
out
of
it
said
giddings
it
wasn
t
occupied
and
so
i
went
into
it
and
sometimes
when
it
rains
you
might
just
as
well
be
outside
if
it
suits
you
i
will
come
here
sprague
told
him
that
the
sooner
he
came
the
better
but
giddings
declined
an
invitation
to
supper
because
he
knew
his
wife
was
waiting
for
him
so
he
got
on
his
horse
and
rode
off
it
kinder
runs
in
my
mind
that
that
man
giddings
will
be
a
good
fellow
to
tie
to
said
sprague
as
he
drew
his
chair
up
to
the
table
there
s
no
end
to
the
way
he
hates
the
rebels
and
it
s
my
opinion
that
when
he
shoots
at
them
he
will
shoot
to
but
do
you
really
think
there
is
going
to
be
a
fight
inquired
his
wife
she
asked
this
in
a
very
indifferent
manner
as
if
she
did
not
care
whether
it
came
or
not
she
had
got
used
to
thinking
of
such
things
sprague
by
way
of
reply
told
her
all
about
the
convention
and
described
to
her
the
visit
of
the
enrolling
officers
who
had
come
up
there
to
enlist
men
for
the
confederate
army
did
they
get
any
inquired
sprague
not
much
there
were
a
thousand
men
there
under
arms
and
that
is
rather
more
than
two
men
want
to
handle
they
know
all
about
our
plans
for
knight
showed
them
the
resolutions
of
course
they
are
going
back
to
their
headquarters
and
are
going
to
make
a
fuss
about
i
tell
you
it
won
t
be
long
now
before
we
shall
see
some
confederate
soldiers
up
here
and
i
wonder
if
i
dare
shoot
at
any
of
them
said
leon
if
they
will
let
me
alone
i
believe
i
ll
let
them
how
about
those
rebels
that
we
are
going
to
drive
away
from
here
asked
his
father
i
think
i
have
heard
you
say
something
pretty
rough
against
carl
well
that
s
a
different
matter
carl
won
t
let
me
alone
and
i
am
determined
that
hereafter
i
am
going
to
live
in
peace
he
told
tom
howe
that
he
wished
he
had
been
jammed
up
in
that
log
heap
and
i
don
t
like
to
have
people
talk
that
early
the
next
morning
sprague
s
family
were
up
and
stirring
leon
was
surprised
when
he
looked
at
his
father
there
was
a
determined
expression
on
his
face
and
the
boy
became
aware
that
he
was
about
to
engage
in
an
enterprise
that
promised
at
some
future
time
to
bring
him
no
end
of
trouble
leon
took
his
cue
from
it
and
from
that
time
he
was
not
so
joyous
as
he
had
been
he
took
his
revolver
out
shot
it
at
a
mark
and
then
proceeded
to
load
it
very
carefully
there
was
only
a
man
and
a
boy
and
two
women
in
the
family
he
intended
to
send
out
of
the
county
and
leon
could
not
understand
that
determined
look
on
his
father
s
face
when
he
sat
down
at
the
he
asked
him
about
it
father
you
seem
to
think
you
are
going
to
have
a
handful
in
sending
that
swayne
family
away
from
among
their
friends
said
he
what
do
you
look
for
i
don
t
look
for
anything
now
said
sprague
there
will
be
a
time
when
they
will
come
back
old
man
swayne
is
a
fighter
and
it
will
stand
us
well
in
hand
to
get
rid
of
him
the
conversation
was
dropped
there
and
they
ate
breakfast
in
silence
before
it
was
fairly
ended
the
five
men
on
whom
sprague
was
depending
to
assist
him
stepped
up
on
the
porch
and
came
into
the
house
they
were
all
invited
to
sit
down
and
take
another
breakfast
but
all
declined
having
broken
their
fast
several
hours
before
you
see
sprague
we
got
an
order
from
the
secretary
of
war
and
we
ve
got
to
be
on
hand
said
one
of
the
men
it
would
not
do
to
go
back
on
anything
he
tells
i
don
t
know
what
they
put
me
in
for
that
office
for
said
sprague
i
don
t
see
that
i
have
got
anything
to
well
wait
until
it
comes
to
fighting
and
then
you
will
find
plenty
to
do
now
if
you
are
all
ready
we
ll
go
on
said
the
man
forgetting
that
he
was
giving
orders
to
his
superior
officer
we
can
t
get
rid
of
that
swayne
family
any
too
quick
they
re
all
the
time
boasting
and
bragging
of
what
they
intend
to
do
and
now
we
will
give
them
a
leon
found
opportunity
to
kiss
his
mother
and
when
he
went
out
on
the
porch
where
tom
howe
was
sitting
and
waiting
for
him
they
fell
in
behind
the
men
who
shouldered
their
rifles
and
marched
at
a
brisk
pace
toward
swayne
s
house
there
was
no
attempt
at
military
movement
for
there
was
not
one
in
the
party
who
knew
anything
about
it
but
they
went
ahead
just
as
if
they
were
going
in
the
woods
in
due
time
they
came
to
a
which
led
down
to
swayne
s
house
and
here
they
stopped
for
there
was
something
that
drew
their
attention
and
angered
them
not
a
little
before
they
left
ellisville
on
the
day
of
the
convention
knight
had
given
several
copies
of
the
resolutions
to
men
living
in
different
parts
of
the
county
with
the
request
that
they
should
nail
them
up
on
trees
there
was
no
in
the
county
in
order
to
give
those
who
were
not
there
timely
notice
of
what
they
had
done
the
man
who
served
this
notice
performed
his
duty
for
the
tacks
were
in
the
tree
plain
enough
but
it
hadn
t
been
able
to
do
much
good
the
notice
had
been
torn
down
and
the
pieces
scattered
about
on
the
ground
well
i
do
think
in
my
soul
began
one
of
the
men
he
wasn
t
going
to
let
anybody
see
it
was
he
look
here
exclaimed
leon
who
had
grown
wonderfully
sharp
sighted
of
late
i
know
who
did
it
it
was
that
miserable
carl
swayne
do
you
not
see
his
footprints
here
in
the
dust
that
s
so
now
what
shall
we
do
with
him
sprague
you
are
secretary
of
war
and
you
ought
to
be
able
to
say
what
shall
be
done
with
him
knight
never
thought
yesterday
when
he
gave
out
those
resolutions
that
somebody
would
go
to
work
and
pull
them
meanwhile
leon
had
been
busy
gathering
up
the
torn
fragments
of
the
resolution
that
were
scattered
around
when
he
got
them
together
he
compared
them
and
saw
they
were
all
there
i
ll
fix
him
said
he
and
i
ll
make
him
so
sorry
that
he
ever
tore
this
down
that
he
ll
go
by
a
resolution
the
next
time
he
sees
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
ll
make
him
write
it
over
again
and
come
here
and
put
it
up
said
leon
savagely
that
s
the
idea
said
tom
howe
he
pulled
it
down
and
of
course
he
must
put
it
up
i
ll
be
close
at
your
heels
when
you
are
doing
sprague
said
nothing
but
leon
noticed
that
the
look
on
his
face
got
deeper
than
ever
he
led
the
way
at
increased
speed
toward
swayne
s
house
and
in
a
few
minutes
turned
through
the
carriageway
and
saw
swayne
and
his
nephew
carl
sitting
on
the
front
porch
they
evidently
grew
alarmed
at
seeing
them
for
they
arose
from
their
chairs
and
held
on
to
the
backs
of
them
good
morning
said
swayne
and
his
voice
trembled
and
his
hand
shook
as
he
hauled
up
some
chairs
for
them
to
seat
themselves
i
did
not
expect
to
see
so
many
of
you
here
this
fine
we
have
no
time
to
sit
down
said
sprague
who
was
supposed
to
do
all
the
talking
you
are
a
rebel
are
you
not
that
is
it
depends
on
what
you
call
a
rebel
said
swayne
trying
to
laugh
at
his
own
wit
i
am
opposed
to
your
trying
to
take
this
county
out
of
the
state
because
so
i
supposed
we
have
come
here
to
tell
you
that
you
can
pack
up
and
leave
this
county
as
soon
as
you
please
we
don
t
want
to
hear
any
argument
about
where
shall
i
go
to
exclaimed
swayne
while
the
boy
turned
whiter
than
ever
if
i
leave
here
i
leave
everything
i
have
got
behind
we
will
give
you
an
hour
to
pack
up
things
if
you
are
in
the
house
at
the
end
of
that
time
we
shall
set
fire
to
well
now
see
here
said
swayne
who
grew
more
frightened
than
ever
i
can
t
pack
up
in
an
i
have
told
you
just
what
i
intend
to
do
said
sprague
consulting
his
watch
it
is
now
ten
o
clock
if
you
are
in
here
at
eleven
we
shall
set
the
house
going
if
you
are
out
of
it
in
that
time
why
we
ll
save
it
you
want
to
make
up
your
mind
in
a
of
all
the
fellows
i
ever
saw
you
are
the
beat
said
swayne
his
fear
giving
place
to
anger
i
wish
i
had
half
a
dozen
confederate
soldiers
here
to
protect
by
gum
we
ll
set
the
house
before
you
get
out
of
it
said
one
of
sprague
s
men
you
ain
t
to
talk
to
us
like
one
moment
bud
we
ll
sit
down
here
on
the
porch
until
he
gets
through
being
mad
and
then
maybe
he
ll
pack
up
you
had
better
go
swayne
for
as
sure
as
we
are
sitting
on
this
porch
so
sure
will
we
set
fire
to
in
the
meantime
leon
and
tom
had
stood
close
together
and
as
carl
flounced
into
the
house
after
his
uncle
the
two
bounded
up
the
steps
and
went
up
to
the
frightened
boy
a
word
in
your
ear
said
leon
well
i
don
t
want
anything
to
do
with
you
said
carl
almost
ready
to
cry
when
he
found
himself
driven
away
from
his
home
a
man
who
will
do
as
you
have
done
has
no
business
with
a
white
one
moment
said
leon
while
tom
cocked
his
gun
and
brought
it
to
bear
on
carl
s
head
that
brings
you
to
your
senses
don
t
it
here
s
a
resolution
of
secession
that
my
father
got
up
yesterday
and
which
was
left
on
a
tree
down
here
and
i
found
it
torn
up
and
strewn
on
the
ground
did
you
have
a
hand
in
it
say
tom
i
want
you
to
turn
that
gun
the
other
way
said
carl
who
dared
not
move
for
fear
that
the
rifle
would
still
be
pointed
at
him
did
you
have
a
hand
in
it
repeated
leon
yes
i
did
said
carl
who
remembering
that
his
uncle
had
got
off
easy
by
showing
some
grit
now
resolved
to
show
a
little
himself
i
will
tear
up
every
one
you
put
well
i
want
you
to
go
into
the
house
and
bring
out
some
writing
materials
and
sit
down
at
this
table
here
on
the
porch
and
draw
up
a
full
copy
of
this
resolution
said
leon
and
carl
had
never
heard
him
speak
so
before
as
he
spoke
he
drew
a
revolver
from
his
pocket
i
can
t
write
as
well
as
that
stammered
carl
who
saw
that
he
had
got
to
do
something
very
soon
i
wish
you
would
put
that
revolver
away
you
don
t
know
how
it
worries
me
to
have
those
things
in
you
can
write
well
enough
go
and
get
the
pen
and
ink
and
mind
you
you
want
to
be
out
here
in
short
order
or
we
will
be
in
there
after
carl
hurried
into
the
house
while
tom
uncocked
his
gun
and
leaned
upon
it
and
leon
put
his
revolver
into
his
pocket
they
didn
t
think
they
would
have
any
more
use
for
them
carl
went
at
once
to
the
room
in
which
his
aunt
was
busy
packing
up
some
of
her
clothes
and
the
face
he
brought
with
him
was
enough
to
attract
anybody
s
attention
well
carl
this
is
pretty
rough
ain
t
it
said
his
uncle
who
was
engaged
in
getting
some
of
his
own
things
together
i
should
say
it
was
whimpered
carl
are
you
not
going
to
be
revenged
on
these
fellows
we
ll
be
revenged
on
them
so
quick
that
they
won
t
know
it
said
his
aunt
in
a
husky
voice
she
didn
t
cry
but
her
hands
trembled
and
her
face
was
very
white
where
are
your
writing
materials
aunt
that
little
leon
sprague
is
going
to
make
me
write
out
those
resolutions
i
tore
down
i
wish
with
uncle
that
we
had
some
half
a
dozen
confederate
soldiers
here
wouldn
t
we
make
a
scattering
among
them
carl
you
can
t
have
those
writing
materials
said
his
aunt
who
was
struck
motionless
with
surprise
tell
him
that
we
haven
t
got
any
in
the
house
the
young
jackanapes
where
s
your
rifle
that
you
don
t
use
it
i
wish
i
were
a
man
for
about
twenty
minutes
there
wouldn
t
be
so
many
of
them
as
there
are
but
aunt
they
have
got
and
they
pulled
them
on
me
said
carl
if
i
don
t
get
them
out
there
very
soon
they
will
come
after
you
will
find
them
in
the
top
bureau
drawer
said
his
aunt
who
began
to
think
it
was
necessary
to
show
a
little
speed
wait
until
i
get
my
things
all
together
and
get
out
there
i
will
give
them
a
piece
of
my
now
lydia
you
want
to
be
mighty
careful
what
you
say
out
there
said
her
husband
they
have
got
weapons
and
they
had
just
as
soon
use
them
as
not
it
is
a
pretty
piece
of
business
this
allowing
strangers
to
drive
us
away
from
our
home
but
i
tell
you
we
ll
have
revenge
for
it
sooner
or
later
pack
up
all
your
things
in
a
hurry
for
we
have
an
hour
left
us
in
which
to
save
our
carl
seeing
that
his
uncle
had
no
way
to
propose
for
him
to
get
out
of
making
a
copy
of
that
secession
resolution
hunted
up
the
writing
materials
as
soon
as
he
could
and
went
out
on
the
porch
with
them
he
found
leon
and
tom
there
and
they
were
getting
impatient
look
here
said
the
former
if
you
want
to
help
your
uncle
get
his
things
together
you
will
move
a
little
spryer
than
that
now
sit
down
at
this
table
and
make
out
a
full
copy
of
this
paper
just
as
it
was
when
you
pulled
it
i
ll
bet
you
won
t
always
have
things
all
your
own
way
said
carl
as
he
seated
himself
and
removed
the
stopper
from
the
you
don
t
suppose
we
ll
come
back
do
you
i
suppose
you
will
and
that
you
will
have
men
with
you
said
leon
but
you
must
bring
all
of
two
thousand
men
to
put
this
rebellion
down
don
t
let
s
have
any
more
talk
go
on
and
write
out
that
and
remember
it
s
got
to
be
the
same
as
it
was
there
said
tom
when
he
saw
carl
arrange
the
pieces
without
reference
to
what
came
after
them
if
you
don
t
you
will
have
to
write
it
over
while
carl
was
busy
with
his
copying
his
uncle
and
aunt
came
out
on
the
porch
they
didn
t
say
a
word
but
brought
with
them
a
large
bundle
of
clothing
that
they
wanted
to
save
aunt
lydia
showed
that
she
would
have
annihilated
sprague
if
she
could
for
the
glance
she
cast
upon
him
was
full
of
hate
swayne
then
took
a
horn
down
from
a
nail
under
the
porch
and
blew
two
long
blasts
upon
it
that
was
a
signal
to
let
the
know
that
they
were
wanted
presently
the
came
up
a
half
a
dozen
of
them
and
although
they
may
have
been
very
smart
negroes
the
clothing
which
they
wore
did
not
proclaim
the
fact
there
was
hardly
a
piece
of
cloth
on
them
that
wasn
t
patched
until
it
was
almost
ready
to
drop
off
their
persons
they
looked
on
in
surprise
when
they
saw
so
many
union
men
there
they
used
to
say
that
the
darkies
were
rather
blunt
in
such
matters
and
that
they
didn
t
know
who
the
union
men
were
and
saw
the
piles
of
clothing
that
had
been
brought
out
but
the
first
words
their
master
spoke
to
them
cleared
everything
up
we
ve
got
to
go
away
from
home
now
or
these
men
are
going
to
burn
it
said
swayne
hitch
those
mules
to
the
and
bring
them
up
here
be
in
a
hurry
now
for
we
have
no
time
to
the
darkies
rolled
their
eyes
in
great
astonishment
and
then
went
about
their
work
with
alacrity
in
a
few
minutes
the
wagons
were
driven
up
to
the
door
and
the
darkies
began
to
pile
in
the
clothes
while
sprague
was
watching
them
he
became
aware
that
somebody
was
trying
to
attract
his
attention
a
pebble
thrown
by
a
friendly
hand
hit
him
on
the
shoulder
he
faced
about
and
saw
one
of
the
darkies
behind
the
house
when
he
saw
sprague
looking
at
him
he
beckoned
to
him
to
come
where
he
was

cause
marse
swayne
says
the
negro
started
one
way
because
he
heard
somebody
calling
him
and
sprague
joined
the
men
on
the
porch
feeling
as
if
he
had
a
big
responsibility
resting
upon
him
he
didn
t
agree
to
take
all
the
darkies
in
the
county
who
might
make
up
their
minds
to
run
away
from
their
masters
and
how
was
he
going
to
support
them
all
and
find
work
for
them
to
do
i
tell
you
this
thing
is
coming
to
a
head
said
sprague
to
the
man
who
sat
next
to
him
you
remember
what
stephens
said
about
having
a
government
whose
cornerstone
should
be
slavery
the
man
remembered
it
perfectly
they
used
to
get
confederate
papers
when
the
war
first
broke
out
but
now
that
they
were
in
rebellion
and
the
postmaster
was
a
rebel
they
didn
t
get
a
sight
of
one
the
man
who
had
charge
of
the
office
removed
to
mobile
as
soon
as
he
saw
how
things
were
going
and
since
then
there
had
not
been
any
well
sir
old
cuff
has
just
been
talking
to
me
and
he
thinks
of
running
away
he
says
that
if
he
goes
over
into
the
other
county
he
won
t
get
his
good
said
the
man
i
am
glad
of
it
we
ll
see
how
their
is
going
to
hold
out
when
they
get
their
confederacy
but
they
ain
t
to
but
this
old
cuff
thinks
i
am
going
to
support
him
said
sprague
i
haven
t
got
any
work
for
him
to
send
him
into
the
woods
to
cut
logs
for
you
said
the
man
i
might
do
that
but
i
don
t
see
where
i
am
going
to
find
market
for
them
but
i
will
get
along
somehow
well
half
an
hour
is
gone
and
they
haven
t
got
many
things
out
yet
leon
and
tom
seem
to
be
making
it
all
right
with
carl
don
t
they
the
two
boys
referred
to
stood
patiently
by
until
the
resolutions
were
complete
then
tom
took
his
copy
and
leon
fastened
his
eyes
upon
the
torn
manuscript
and
waited
for
him
to
read
it
it
was
all
correct
there
wasn
t
a
mistake
in
it
you
write
a
pretty
good
hand
for
a
boy
who
hasn
t
been
to
school
more
than
you
have
said
leon
keep
your
compliments
for
them
that
need
them
said
carl
snappishly
i
don
t
care
to
hear
you
haven
t
got
through
with
this
business
yet
said
leon
in
a
voice
which
he
meant
should
carry
conviction
with
it
you
found
this
resolution
on
a
tree
and
you
tore
it
down
so
that
people
couldn
t
see
it
i
intend
that
you
shall
go
back
and
post
this
thing
up
but
you
told
me
i
should
have
to
help
my
uncle
carry
out
his
things
said
carl
anxious
to
shirk
all
the
responsibility
he
could
oh
we
ll
wait
until
you
carry
out
your
things
said
leon
with
a
smile
you
are
going
right
by
the
tree
and
it
won
t
hurt
you
at
all
to
stop
and
nail
this
thing
carl
gathered
up
the
pen
and
ink
and
disappeared
in
the
house
and
leon
and
tom
went
down
the
steps
to
join
the
men
who
were
sitting
there
i
got
it
but
i
had
hard
work
in
getting
it
too
said
leon
how
much
longer
time
has
he
got
not
quite
fifteen
minutes
said
sprague
and
i
see
he
is
hustling
things
more
lively
than
he
did
you
won
t
start
the
fire
when
the
quarter
of
an
hour
is
up
seeing
that
he
is
doing
the
best
he
can
to
get
them
out
oh
no
i
wanted
to
see
him
get
to
work
that
is
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
the
furniture
and
clothes
they
intended
to
take
with
them
had
been
loaded
on
the
wagons
and
then
the
women
began
to
slam
the
blinds
and
fasten
them
securely
when
swayne
came
out
on
the
porch
he
locked
that
door
and
put
the
key
into
his
pocket
we
have
got
some
things
in
there
yet
but
we
don
t
want
these
traitors
to
have
them
said
his
wife
in
a
tone
which
was
intended
very
plainly
for
the
ears
of
sprague
and
his
friends
let
them
go
somewhere
else
and
steal
somebody
else
swayne
did
not
pay
any
attention
to
it
he
buttoned
up
the
key
in
his
pocket
and
looked
all
around
as
if
he
were
searching
for
someone
at
last
he
called
out
cuff
where
is
that
lazy
nigger
cuff
come
here
this
minute
or
i
will
stripe
your
jacket
till
you
can
t
sprague
was
surprised
he
thought
it
very
likely
that
he
could
tell
swayne
what
had
become
of
the
negro
cuff
he
had
been
sent
with
all
his
companions
to
the
quarters
to
bring
some
clothes
and
other
things
they
wanted
to
save
and
he
hadn
t
showed
up
since
it
would
be
very
easy
for
them
to
slip
through
the
cornfield
and
so
into
the
woods
and
that
was
right
where
cuff
was
when
his
master
was
calling
him
carl
suppose
you
run
down
to
the
quarters
and
hurry
them
up
said
his
uncle
we
want
to
get
away
from
here
as
soon
as
we
can
there
s
too
many
union
people
the
man
who
had
threatened
to
burn
the
house
before
they
got
out
of
it
was
sitting
on
the
steps
a
little
way
from
sprague
he
wiggled
and
twisted
and
wanted
to
say
something
in
return
but
there
was
his
superior
officer
who
didn
t
say
anything
and
he
thought
he
would
hold
in
for
a
better
opportunity
carl
was
away
about
fifteen
minutes
and
when
he
came
back
his
face
bore
evidence
that
he
was
utterly
confounded
there
ain
t
a
nigger
about
the
quarters
said
he
their
clothes
both
bedding
and
wearing
apparel
are
gone
and
that
proves
that
they
have
run
that
s
the
first
time
i
ever
had
a
nigger
serve
me
that
way
said
swayne
pacing
up
and
down
the
porch
run
away
have
they
if
i
ever
get
my
hands
on
them
i
ll
make
it
awfully
uneasy
for
them
to
lie
down
now
i
tell
you
did
you
follow
them
into
the
woods
to
see
where
they
went
no
i
didn
t
i
saw
their
tracks
leading
through
the
cornfield
and
then
i
came
home
to
report
the
matter
to
you
those
niggers
think
they
are
going
to
get
their
freedom
yes
and
you
might
have
expected
it
said
his
aunt
turning
her
flashing
eyes
upon
sprague
what
are
these
union
men
here
for
if
it
isn
t
to
coax
the
niggers
away
from
an
honest
confederate
mrs
swayne
we
had
no
hand
in
inducing
your
negroes
to
run
away
from
you
said
sprague
who
now
began
to
get
angry
they
said
they
were
not
going
into
the
other
county
with
you
and
i
told
them
that
they
must
depend
entirely
upon
by
gum
you
want
to
see
your
house
go
before
you
get
away
from
it
said
the
man
who
had
threatened
to
burn
them
out
any
more
such
talk
as
that
and
i
ll
set
her
by
gum
i
carl
you
will
have
to
do
some
driving
for
us
for
we
can
t
stop
to
hunt
the
niggers
said
swayne
oh
now
i
didn
t
agree
to
do
driving
whined
carl
let
s
stop
and
go
into
the
woods
after
you
have
already
got
your
things
loaded
on
the
wagons
and
i
must
ask
you
to
drive
on
said
sprague
it
is
my
duty
to
stay
by
you
until
you
get
beyond
carl
jump
on
that
wagon
and
drive
after
me
said
swayne
i
don
t
want
to
hear
any
more
argument
about
tom
you
haven
t
got
any
horse
and
i
advise
you
to
get
into
that
wagon
with
carl
said
leon
when
you
come
to
the
tree
on
which
the
resolution
was
posted
make
him
get
out
and
post
this
one
in
its
place
he
ll
object
but
we
can
t
help
while
carl
was
tying
his
behind
the
wagon
tom
climbed
in
and
seated
himself
on
the
table
which
had
been
placed
there
for
one
of
the
negroes
who
had
gone
off
with
cuff
carl
saw
what
he
was
doing
but
didn
t
make
any
fuss
about
it
he
had
arrived
at
his
uncle
s
conclusion
that
the
best
thing
they
could
do
was
to
take
no
notice
of
the
union
men
by
doing
that
they
would
irritate
them
and
they
would
not
have
so
much
to
brag
of
when
they
talked
about
driving
confederate
families
out
of
the
county
but
they
didn
t
know
sprague
and
his
friends
the
task
was
one
they
did
not
like
but
they
did
it
because
they
had
been
ordered
to
carl
kept
his
mouth
resolutely
closed
until
they
came
to
the
tree
from
which
he
had
torn
down
the
resolutions
he
whipped
up
his
mules
when
he
came
there
but
tom
laid
hold
of
the
reins
and
stopped
them
now
carl
this
is
the
place
said
he
here
s
the
notice
and
you
want
to
get
out
and
tack
it
up
the
nails
are
all
carl
didn
t
know
whether
to
refuse
or
not
but
just
then
leon
came
up
on
his
side
of
the
wagon
leon
had
a
revolver
in
his
pocket
and
carl
did
not
like
to
see
that
so
he
grabbed
the
notice
and
sprang
out
of
the
wagon
in
a
few
minutes
it
was
tacked
up
just
the
same
as
it
was
before
there
said
leon
that
will
do
now
anybody
who
comes
along
here
and
who
wasn
t
at
the
convention
can
see
what
we
did
now
i
guess
you
had
better
get
out
said
carl
addressing
himself
to
tom
howe
no
i
reckon
not
replied
tom
i
ve
got
to
go
with
you
as
long
as
you
stay
in
the
county
and
i
reckon
i
can
get
along
here
as
well
as
i
can
afoot
drive
carl
at
once
closed
his
lips
and
had
nothing
more
to
say
as
they
were
going
by
his
own
house
leon
noticed
that
there
was
nobody
present
for
his
mother
was
too
refined
a
woman
to
take
such
a
paltry
vengeance
on
those
who
did
not
believe
as
she
did
but
there
was
one
little
circumstance
that
attracted
his
attention
he
was
certain
that
he
saw
old
cuff
s
cottonade
coat
disappear
around
the
house
he
did
not
have
more
than
a
glimpse
of
it
but
he
was
sure
it
was
there
when
they
arrived
at
the
they
met
ten
more
men
on
foot
who
were
escorting
four
more
of
secessionists
to
perry
county
which
was
the
nearest
place
they
could
get
and
be
among
friends
they
never
said
a
word
but
fell
in
behind
sprague
and
followed
along
after
him
they
were
all
armed
with
rifles
and
some
of
them
had
revolvers
stuck
in
their
belts
the
sight
of
these
men
made
carl
open
his
eyes
he
had
not
dreamed
that
there
were
so
many
union
men
in
the
county
i
believe
you
ve
got
more
yankees
here
than
confederates
said
he
these
men
are
not
yankees
said
tom
they
are
men
born
here
in
the
south
but
these
ain
t
a
patching
to
what
we
ve
got
if
you
had
been
down
to
that
convention
you
would
have
seen
a
thousand
men
under
arms
there
were
so
many
of
them
that
we
couldn
t
get
them
all
in
the
church
some
of
them
had
to
stay
outside
and
raise
the
well
what
did
you
do
there
besides
pass
the
resolutions
of
secession
asked
carl
for
now
that
his
uncle
was
out
of
hearing
he
seemed
anxious
to
learn
what
had
been
going
on
at
that
meeting
we
elected
officers
said
tom
didn
t
you
do
anything
else
well
yes
there
was
a
couple
of
enrolling
officers
came
there
to
enlist
men
for
the
confederate
army
and
we
sent
them
back
where
they
came
then
the
rebels
don
t
allow
that
this
county
is
out
of
the
state
do
they
said
carl
who
was
overjoyed
to
hear
it
you
have
got
your
own
way
this
time
but
i
tell
you
we
are
coming
back
and
i
won
t
forget
the
boys
that
drew
on
well
that
s
right
i
suppose
they
won
t
draw
any
more
on
you
no
sir
they
won
t
said
carl
hotly
i
don
t
mind
talking
this
way
to
you
but
i
do
hate
the
sight
of
that
revolver
that
leon
sprague
has
in
his
pocket
where
is
he
now
he
is
back
talking
to
those
men
that
came
up
awhile
ago
said
tom
he
can
t
hear
you
but
you
must
remember
that
we
can
fight
tolerable
leon
had
gradually
slackened
his
pace
until
the
single
man
on
horseback
who
seemed
to
be
the
leader
of
the
party
came
up
and
rode
beside
him
well
sir
you
got
em
didn
t
you
said
the
man
you
know
when
your
father
said
he
would
go
up
after
that
man
yesterday
i
felt
rather
anxious
about
him
i
thought
he
would
fight
well
he
didn
t
he
did
not
show
any
signs
of
it
he
was
mighty
saucy
though
and
so
was
that
nephew
of
one
of
our
men
was
sassy
too
do
you
see
that
man
driving
the
next
wagon
he
s
got
a
big
lump
under
his
eye
bob
lee
hit
now
what
did
he
do
that
for
bob
had
the
right
on
his
side
and
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
get
mad
and
strike
the
man
my
father
had
just
as
good
reason
to
hit
swayne
but
he
didn
t
do
he
had
no
business
to
be
sassy
if
bob
hadn
t
a
hit
him
i
would
he
said
that
he
hoped
to
goodness
that
the
rebels
would
come
in
and
take
the
last
scalp
from
our
heads
when
bob
asked
him
to
take
it
back
he
said
he
wouldn
t
do
it
and
so
bob
upended
him
that
was
the
last
sassy
word
given
to
us
it
showed
them
that
we
were
in
earnest
hello
there
s
three
more
fellows
come
up
and
are
talking
to
your
father
and
by
gracious
one
of
them
is
a
rebel
let
s
go
there
and
see
what
they
have
got
to
leon
and
his
friend
urged
their
horses
forward
and
in
a
few
minutes
drew
up
beside
sprague
who
was
listening
to
some
words
the
rebel
had
to
say
to
him
as
he
spoke
he
looked
at
the
women
and
swayne
and
then
sank
his
voice
almost
to
a
whisper
colonel
are
these
some
rebels
that
you
are
taking
out
of
the
county
said
he
we
have
got
so
far
with
them
and
we
expect
to
get
the
rest
of
the
way
answered
sprague
i
want
you
to
come
off
on
one
side
so
that
i
can
talk
to
you
without
fear
of
being
overheard
said
the
rebel
now
he
added
as
the
men
moved
some
distance
down
the
road
the
rebels
are
going
to
move
a
big
along
that
road
you
see
they
have
got
to
go
around
this
county
for
they
don
t
want
to
run
the
risk
of
being
captured
if
they
pass
through
we
stopped
and
saw
president
knight
about
it
and
he
advised
us
to
come
on
and
see
you
said
one
of
the
men
who
had
acted
as
guard
to
the
rebel
take
his
gun
away
from
him
said
sprague
and
the
rebel
promptly
gave
it
up
together
with
his
and
bayonet
have
you
any
other
weapons
about
you
nary
one
sah
said
the
rebel
my
family
is
down
here
a
little
ways
from
ellisville
and
you
may
know
that
i
am
all
right
when
i
bring
them
with
how
did
you
say
you
escaped
i
wasn
t
conscripted
as
a
great
many
were
but
there
was
such
a
pressure
brought
to
bear
upon
me
that
i
thought
i
might
as
well
go
into
the
army
instead
of
waiting
until
i
was
conscripted
in
reality
i
have
been
in
the
service
only
six
months
but
i
have
been
in
three
or
four
little
engagements
i
live
in
perry
county
and
when
i
found
out
what
you
were
doing
here
how
you
had
never
sent
any
men
into
the
army
and
how
there
were
a
thousand
men
here
who
didn
t
intend
to
go
at
all
i
wrote
to
my
wife
advising
her
to
come
here
and
i
would
join
her
after
awhile
but
she
wrote
back
that
she
wouldn
t
stir
a
step
unless
i
came
on
the
night
i
escaped
i
was
on
guard
and
the
corporal
hadn
t
any
more
than
got
away
from
me
when
i
was
missing
i
travelled
all
night
and
at
daylight
reached
my
home
i
packed
up
what
few
things
i
wanted
to
save
and
came
here
and
one
of
my
mules
dropped
dead
as
soon
as
i
got
to
ellisville
i
wanted
the
president
to
go
on
at
once
and
capture
that
train
but
he
thought
i
had
better
come
on
and
see
you
about
well
you
tell
a
pretty
straight
story
and
i
shall
have
to
put
some
faith
in
it
until
i
can
prove
the
contrary
said
sprague
you
are
at
liberty
to
disprove
my
story
in
any
way
you
can
said
the
rebel
earnestly
i
am
dead
shot
on
this
thing
and
if
this
county
is
going
to
stay
out
of
the
confederacy
i
am
going
to
stay
out
i
shall
have
to
send
you
to
my
house
said
sprague
send
me
anywhere
sah
but
stop
and
explain
to
my
family
why
i
don
t
come
home
she
will
appreciate
the
reason
for
she
is
a
soldier
s
father
come
here
a
minute
i
don
t
see
what
s
the
use
of
sending
that
rebel
to
our
house
said
leon
when
his
father
had
drawn
off
on
one
side
he
must
have
a
camp
down
there
in
ellisville
and
now
he
has
given
up
his
weapons
i
don
t
see
how
he
is
going
to
get
away
there
are
fully
five
hundred
men
camped
around
ellisville
well
that
is
so
said
sprague
after
reflecting
a
moment
i
think
i
had
better
take
him
on
to
ellisville
and
leave
him
there
with
plenty
of
men
to
watch
that
would
be
my
way
forward
march
shouted
sprague
as
he
placed
himself
at
the
head
of
his
little
train
and
the
cavalcade
once
more
moved
onward
the
rebel
kept
close
at
his
side
and
leon
rode
a
little
ways
behind
him
there
was
one
thing
that
drew
the
boy
s
attention
and
that
was
the
rebel
s
horse
although
she
was
tired
her
gait
showed
that
she
fretted
and
fumed
at
the
bit
as
if
she
was
anxious
to
go
faster
she
was
a
beautiful
animal
with
limbs
so
small
that
they
did
not
look
strong
enough
to
support
her
weight
may
i
ask
you
where
you
got
that
horse
said
leon
after
he
had
watched
her
for
some
length
of
time
i
stole
her
from
the
said
the
rebel
i
should
not
have
been
able
to
get
home
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
her
i
did
the
rebels
all
the
damage
i
could
before
leaving
there
must
be
some
escort
with
that
isn
t
there
inquired
sprague
there
are
men
including
two
officers
replied
the
rebel
but
half
of
them
you
needn
t
be
afraid
of
for
they
are
all
how
many
wagons
are
there
in
the
train
forty
whereat
leon
opened
his
eyes
in
surprise
will
the
teamsters
fight
fight
exclaimed
the
rebel
in
disgust
no
they
won
t
half
of
them
are
armed
but
they
don
t
know
what
it
is
to
fight
when
they
see
you
coming
up
with
your
guns
all
ready
the
majority
of
them
will
throw
up
their
if
ever
there
was
a
happy
man
in
that
train
it
was
the
rebel
he
joked
and
laughed
because
he
said
he
was
among
friends
once
more
and
could
say
what
he
pleased
and
all
the
way
to
ellisville
entertained
his
auditors
with
thrilling
stories
of
his
earliest
battles
he
told
how
frightened
he
was
when
he
got
into
the
first
one
and
how
he
looked
around
for
a
hollow
log
into
which
he
could
crawl
and
get
out
of
sight
but
there
were
his
companions
all
standing
up
without
being
shot
and
his
pride
made
him
stay
right
where
he
was
at
three
o
clock
they
reached
ellisville
where
the
president
had
located
his
office
as
leon
had
said
there
were
at
least
five
hundred
men
camped
around
there
some
with
their
families
some
had
no
homes
at
all
but
all
wanted
to
be
where
they
could
feel
that
they
were
of
some
assistance
to
knight
they
knew
that
when
a
raid
was
made
upon
the
county
it
would
come
from
perry
the
county
next
on
the
south
and
they
calculated
to
be
at
hand
to
stop
it
here
sprague
halted
his
train
and
went
in
to
hold
an
interview
with
the
president
taking
the
rebel
s
gun
with
him
he
was
gone
but
a
few
minutes
and
when
he
came
out
his
countenance
indicated
that
he
had
resolved
upon
something
he
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
in
among
the
and
other
shelters
which
the
men
had
erected
for
themselves
and
shouted
attention
at
the
top
of
his
voice
and
immediately
every
man
who
heard
him
came
running
up
to
see
what
was
the
matter
when
he
thought
he
had
got
a
sufficient
number
about
him
sprague
proceeded
to
unfold
his
plans
it
wasn
t
the
way
that
a
majority
of
leaders
do
for
they
never
let
their
men
know
what
sort
of
dangers
they
are
going
to
meet
until
they
get
fairly
into
them
we
are
going
out
to
attack
that
said
sprague
and
i
want
all
of
you
who
can
go
to
be
on
hand
here
bright
and
good
exclaimed
one
then
we
ll
have
something
to
sprague
then
went
on
to
tell
them
how
many
wagons
there
were
in
the
train
how
many
teamsters
and
how
large
an
escort
of
soldiers
for
he
put
implicit
faith
in
the
rebel
s
word
he
was
certain
that
five
hundred
men
if
he
could
secure
that
many
advancing
with
their
guns
at
full
cock
would
take
all
the
fight
out
of
them
sprague
was
careful
not
to
talk
so
loud
as
to
attract
the
attention
of
swayne
for
he
knew
that
he
would
warn
the
confederates
having
given
his
men
something
to
think
about
he
rode
back
to
place
himself
at
the
head
of
his
train
which
moved
away
toward
the
county
line
chapter
capturing
a
now
said
sprague
when
leon
rode
up
beside
him
you
want
to
go
and
tell
your
mother
the
reason
that
i
don
t
come
home
i
shall
have
to
stay
here
with
the
men
to
be
ready
to
start
out
with
them
at
an
early
then
after
that
i
suppose
i
can
stay
at
home
said
leon
yes
i
think
that
would
be
the
best
place
for
you
those
men
and
all
of
them
old
soldiers
are
not
going
to
give
up
that
without
some
well
now
i
ll
tell
you
what
s
a
fact
father
said
leon
decidedly
i
just
ain
t
to
stay
at
why
not
said
sprague
in
surprise
if
you
are
going
to
meet
those
men
i
am
going
too
you
needn
t
think
you
are
going
into
danger
without
my
being
close
beside
you
i
wouldn
t
dare
look
mother
in
the
face
again
if
i
should
be
guilty
of
remaining
at
sprague
looked
down
at
the
horn
of
his
saddle
and
thought
about
it
leon
had
really
more
pluck
than
his
father
thought
he
had
and
after
awhile
he
thought
it
would
be
better
to
let
the
boy
have
his
own
way
in
the
matter
i
don
t
see
what
is
the
use
of
sending
any
word
at
all
home
to
mother
said
leon
after
pondering
what
his
father
had
said
she
knows
that
we
are
in
the
service
of
the
county
and
she
won
t
care
whether
we
come
home
or
not
the
best
way
would
be
to
stay
right
down
here
and
go
home
when
we
get
the
job
this
settled
the
matter
and
sprague
never
referred
to
it
again
about
eight
o
clock
they
arrived
at
the
little
bridge
which
spanned
the
creek
that
flowed
between
jones
and
perry
counties
and
there
sprague
halted
his
men
and
motioned
to
swayne
to
go
on
the
man
complied
and
when
he
had
got
far
enough
across
to
let
all
the
wagons
that
came
after
him
get
a
footing
on
confederate
soil
he
stopped
and
jumped
out
thank
goodness
i
ve
got
a
white
man
s
ground
under
my
feet
he
exclaimed
and
no
one
had
ever
seen
him
so
mad
before
he
seemed
to
be
holding
in
for
just
this
occasion
and
he
was
so
angry
that
he
could
scarcely
speak
plainly
i
suppose
that
now
i
can
talk
to
you
as
i
have
a
mind
draw
yourselves
in
line
across
this
bridge
and
hold
your
guns
in
readiness
to
shoot
said
sprague
in
a
low
tone
to
his
men
he
may
open
fire
on
us
before
we
can
get
under
cover
oh
yes
you
can
say
what
you
please
now
he
said
in
his
ordinary
voice
but
i
wouldn
t
say
too
much
till
i
get
behind
that
well
i
want
to
say
this
much
to
you
shouted
swayne
you
have
had
your
own
way
this
time
but
we
are
coming
back
in
less
than
a
week
to
clean
you
all
and
remember
this
exclaimed
carl
from
his
place
in
the
wagon
i
will
bear
in
mind
the
boys
who
drew
on
me
you
see
if
i
don
t
i
ll
tear
down
that
notice
and
every
other
one
that
i
can
and
you
bob
lee
i
ll
remember
you
said
the
man
with
a
lump
under
his
eye
i
ll
teach
you
that
the
next
man
who
says
anything
about
the
you
had
better
let
him
alone
that
s
all
he
added
when
he
saw
bob
raise
his
gun
to
his
shoulder
if
you
are
all
ready
go
on
said
sprague
swayne
was
a
long
time
in
getting
into
his
wagon
he
would
place
his
foot
upon
the
hub
and
then
one
of
the
men
would
say
something
insulting
in
regard
to
the
men
they
had
just
left
and
swayne
would
take
his
foot
down
and
stand
there
until
he
heard
what
the
man
had
to
say
he
was
in
earnest
when
he
said
they
were
coming
back
to
clean
the
union
men
all
out
and
that
there
wouldn
t
be
hide
nor
hair
of
them
left
when
they
did
come
and
finally
he
got
into
his
wagon
and
drove
on
when
he
looked
behind
to
see
what
had
become
of
sprague
and
his
party
he
saw
them
just
disappearing
around
the
nearest
bend
in
the
road
i
wish
i
dared
shoot
at
them
said
he
well
i
ll
shoot
at
them
and
welcome
said
the
man
whom
bob
lee
had
struck
as
he
reached
for
his
gun
don
t
do
it
jim
expostulated
swayne
it
don
t
you
see
the
bump
under
my
eye
said
the
man
i
can
see
the
chap
who
did
it
and
i
can
pick
him
off
just
as
easy
as
you
would
kill
a
if
you
shoot
at
them
they
will
come
back
here
and
arrest
the
whole
of
us
and
take
us
back
to
their
camp
and
make
us
stand
a
said
swayne
i
am
not
to
stand
punishment
for
your
deeds
and
mine
into
the
this
view
of
the
matter
rather
arrested
the
man
s
hand
and
he
sat
with
his
gun
resting
across
his
knees
muttering
curses
not
loud
but
deep
until
he
saw
the
union
men
disappear
around
a
bend
in
the
road
sprague
knew
that
he
stood
a
chance
of
being
fired
upon
and
that
was
what
he
intended
to
do
he
would
arrest
the
whole
of
them
and
take
them
to
camp
but
swayne
was
a
little
too
sharp
for
him
it
was
two
o
clock
when
they
arrived
at
the
camp
and
the
men
to
show
that
they
knew
what
sort
of
respect
ought
to
be
paid
to
the
secretary
of
war
went
off
to
hunt
up
some
forage
for
his
horse
and
leon
s
before
they
went
to
bed
well
leon
said
sprague
after
the
horses
had
been
picketed
with
plenty
to
eat
and
the
men
had
all
gone
away
we
haven
t
got
any
no
matter
for
that
said
leon
it
won
t
be
the
first
time
i
have
slept
out
with
nothing
to
cover
me
get
some
leaves
and
they
will
do
just
as
they
walked
along
the
road
as
they
talked
and
sprague
could
not
help
thinking
what
a
big
army
he
was
going
to
have
to
attack
that
every
step
of
the
way
he
saw
and
he
knew
that
there
were
stalwart
men
sleeping
under
them
finally
he
drew
up
before
a
where
there
was
a
sentry
sitting
in
front
of
the
door
he
did
not
carry
his
arms
at
a
support
nor
did
he
bring
his
piece
to
arms
port
and
call
out
who
comes
there
when
he
saw
sprague
and
leon
approaching
but
he
greeted
him
in
regular
backwoods
style
hallo
sprague
said
he
did
you
get
your
parties
through
all
right
the
secretary
of
war
replied
that
he
did
this
must
be
the
home
of
that
rebel
isn
t
it
yes
but
he
has
been
perfectly
peaceable
all
night
he
didn
t
sleep
at
all
the
night
no
but
i
am
awake
now
called
out
a
voice
from
the
inside
and
there
was
a
little
fussing
in
the
cabin
and
the
rebel
came
to
the
door
say
colonel
are
you
going
to
stay
here
all
night
that
is
the
intention
i
want
to
get
an
early
start
and
it
is
too
far
for
me
to
go
well
now
i
know
that
you
haven
t
got
any
quilts
said
the
rebel
disappearing
under
the
roof
of
the
here
s
some
that
will
add
to
your
comfort
take
them
and
sprague
thanked
the
rebel
for
his
gift
and
spread
the
quilts
down
where
they
intended
to
camp
for
the
night
while
leon
told
himself
that
it
was
a
good
thing
to
have
a
father
who
was
secretary
of
war
after
all
they
slept
soundly
for
a
little
while
but
at
three
sprague
was
awake
and
busily
engaged
in
arousing
the
men
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
it
they
were
all
up
and
cooking
their
breakfast
and
in
an
hour
more
the
grove
was
empty
five
hundred
men
were
going
out
to
attack
that
and
if
possible
secure
something
to
eat
we
don
t
mean
to
say
that
they
were
hard
up
for
provisions
for
there
was
bacon
and
enough
in
the
county
to
last
them
for
months
but
we
mean
that
they
had
lived
so
long
on
these
things
that
they
had
grown
tired
of
them
they
had
been
used
to
something
better
than
that
before
the
war
and
when
their
boats
came
back
from
after
their
owners
had
succeeded
in
selling
their
logs
the
housewife
found
pickles
canned
meat
and
condensed
milk
enough
to
last
her
family
for
six
months
that
was
one
thing
that
the
men
had
in
view
and
another
thing
some
of
them
were
in
need
of
clothes
and
they
believed
that
this
had
something
of
that
kind
stowed
away
for
the
boys
in
mobile
and
better
than
here
was
the
thing
that
led
the
men
to
look
with
favor
upon
robbing
the
would
show
the
confederates
they
were
in
earnest
what
the
union
people
wanted
to
do
it
was
a
long
march
from
the
grove
in
ellisville
to
the
stream
that
separated
the
two
counties
but
the
men
went
about
it
in
earnest
and
determined
to
get
there
in
time
to
stop
that
of
course
there
was
plenty
of
joking
and
laughing
while
they
were
on
their
own
ground
but
the
moment
they
struck
the
bridge
a
deep
silence
fell
upon
the
company
we
ought
by
rights
to
say
that
the
men
had
been
divided
into
five
companies
a
hundred
men
in
each
and
that
each
one
had
three
officers
to
direct
them
but
the
union
men
of
jones
county
had
not
got
that
far
in
military
tactics
there
was
only
one
man
at
the
head
sprague
and
he
had
the
full
management
of
them
sprague
rode
at
the
head
of
the
line
in
company
with
all
the
men
who
had
horses
and
there
must
have
been
about
fifty
of
them
and
when
he
crossed
the
bridge
he
sent
a
dozen
of
them
on
ahead
to
travel
at
full
speed
to
see
if
the
had
passed
i
needn
t
remind
you
that
you
want
to
go
into
every
house
you
come
to
and
if
there
is
a
man
in
there
take
him
in
said
he
don
t
say
a
word
to
the
women
but
ketch
the
men
it
won
t
do
to
leave
any
rebels
behind
us
for
they
can
easily
warn
the
train
and
so
we
must
take
them
with
us
until
we
get
the
job
done
silas
i
will
appoint
you
captain
of
this
silas
raised
his
hand
to
his
hat
with
something
that
was
intended
for
a
military
salute
called
all
his
men
about
him
and
went
down
the
road
at
a
keen
jump
while
the
rest
of
the
company
travelled
on
as
before
an
hour
afterward
they
came
up
with
their
scouts
and
silas
at
once
rode
up
to
report
the
hain
t
passed
yet
and
we
ve
got
five
men
and
two
of
them
are
rebels
we
had
to
chase
through
a
cornfield
after
one
and
fired
two
shots
at
did
you
hit
him
no
we
didn
t
hit
him
but
he
was
mighty
ready
to
throw
up
his
hands
when
he
heard
the
bullets
did
you
get
their
guns
yes
we
got
them
all
now
the
best
thing
we
can
do
said
sprague
turning
about
to
face
his
men
is
to
go
down
the
road
and
conceal
ourselves
in
the
bushes
when
you
see
me
move
my
arm
this
way
here
he
raised
his
arm
above
his
head
and
waved
it
toward
the
right
and
left
of
the
road
you
will
all
divide
and
go
into
the
timber
on
different
sides
and
when
you
hear
me
whistle
this
way
he
put
his
hand
to
his
mouth
and
gave
a
whistle
that
could
have
been
heard
a
mile
then
you
may
know
that
it
is
time
for
you
to
get
down
to
business
but
bear
one
thing
in
mind
don
t
shoot
unless
you
have
the
company
or
more
properly
speaking
the
battalion
moved
on
again
and
in
half
an
hour
not
one
of
them
was
in
sight
they
had
divided
right
and
left
as
sprague
had
directed
and
taken
up
their
positions
on
opposite
sides
of
the
road
and
there
was
not
the
least
noise
or
confusion
about
it
two
of
the
men
had
gone
down
the
road
to
see
if
the
train
was
coming
and
they
were
impatiently
waiting
their
return
the
prisoners
had
all
been
turned
over
to
sprague
and
he
was
having
something
of
a
time
with
one
of
them
who
was
determined
that
he
would
not
hold
his
tongue
he
had
a
very
shrill
voice
and
when
he
spoke
in
his
ordinary
tone
it
could
be
heard
a
long
distance
now
sprague
i
don
t
see
the
sense
in
your
doing
this
said
the
man
and
he
seemed
to
have
pitched
his
tones
so
loud
that
they
could
have
heard
him
at
the
end
of
the
line
you
take
me
away
from
my
home
who
never
did
the
union
any
you
are
a
nice
fellow
you
are
said
one
of
the
men
who
happened
to
be
close
around
when
the
person
was
talking
i
take
notice
of
the
fact
that
ebenezer
hale
wanted
to
come
up
here
so
as
to
be
among
union
men
and
you
heard
his
story
and
when
he
was
asleep
that
night
you
went
off
and
got
a
lot
of
rebels
to
surround
and
carry
him
off
where
is
he
now
in
jail
likely
and
you
you
you
never
did
the
union
men
any
harm
you
had
oughter
go
to
jail
until
this
trouble
is
all
well
now
simeon
i
did
just
what
i
thought
was
best
for
the
community
i
didn
t
have
nothing
against
ebenezer
hale
but
i
knew
that
if
he
went
into
this
that
s
enough
said
sprague
we
have
listened
to
you
all
we
want
now
sprague
i
shan
t
quit
talking
until
i
have
a
mind
to
said
the
man
you
have
undertaken
more
than
you
can
accomplish
and
i
sim
cut
a
little
piece
of
wood
about
four
inches
long
and
tie
a
string
to
each
end
of
it
said
sprague
if
kelley
don
t
shut
up
we
ll
gag
oh
now
sprague
don
t
gag
me
said
the
man
sinking
his
voice
almost
to
a
whisper
this
time
i
won
t
say
one
word
more
i
won
t
upon
my
the
gag
was
duly
cut
and
prepared
and
nothing
was
wanting
except
another
word
from
kelley
to
induce
sim
to
put
it
where
it
belonged
but
the
man
took
just
one
look
at
it
and
concluded
that
the
best
thing
he
could
do
was
to
keep
still
he
never
showed
any
disposition
to
open
his
head
until
the
scouts
were
seen
coming
back
with
the
information
that
the
train
was
approaching
they
came
in
a
hurry
too
as
if
they
were
anxious
to
get
something
off
their
minds
where
s
sprague
were
the
words
they
shouted
as
they
galloped
along
the
road
whereupon
sprague
showed
himself
the
train
is
coming
they
said
as
soon
as
they
came
within
hearing
of
their
leader
every
blessed
one
of
them
is
coming
and
are
acting
as
if
they
didn
t
fear
did
they
see
you
inquired
sprague
no
they
didn
t
we
hid
our
horses
in
the
bushes
and
then
went
and
lay
down
beside
the
road
until
we
saw
the
train
coming
yes
sir
we
re
going
to
get
them
sprague
and
his
scouts
went
into
the
bushes
again
out
of
sight
and
then
he
noticed
that
kelley
wasn
t
so
anxious
to
keep
in
the
background
so
much
as
he
had
been
he
was
even
disposed
to
go
out
of
the
bushes
but
he
hadn
t
made
many
steps
in
that
direction
when
simeon
seized
him
by
the
collar
and
stretched
him
flat
on
his
back
oh
now
not
another
word
out
of
you
said
his
guard
savagely
you
will
get
the
gag
in
your
mouth
as
sure
as
you
re
take
your
stand
close
behind
him
said
sprague
who
was
getting
angry
now
and
with
the
very
first
words
he
utters
shoot
him
down
we
are
not
going
to
have
our
plans
spoilt
for
the
sake
of
leon
who
stood
close
at
his
father
s
side
and
heard
all
this
conversation
grew
as
pale
as
death
when
he
found
that
the
was
coming
he
clutched
his
revolver
nervously
and
determined
that
whatever
danger
his
father
got
into
he
would
be
there
to
help
him
the
leader
glanced
at
his
son
s
pale
face
and
said
in
a
low
tone
leon
i
think
you
had
better
stay
here
as
a
guard
to
these
are
you
going
out
there
to
face
that
escort
asked
leon
of
course
i
am
i
shall
be
right
in
the
thickest
of
then
i
m
going
but
you
will
be
safe
here
they
can
t
hit
you
even
if
they
shoot
at
but
leon
only
shook
his
head
and
at
that
moment
somebody
whispered
that
the
foremost
wagons
were
in
sight
that
turned
sprague
s
attention
into
a
new
channel
and
leon
was
left
to
himself
he
glanced
at
simeon
and
his
captive
and
was
gratified
to
see
that
kelley
had
been
forced
to
sit
down
and
simeon
was
standing
there
with
his
cocked
gun
ranged
within
two
inches
of
his
head
he
wanted
to
speak
and
made
a
motion
to
simeon
to
turn
the
gun
the
other
way
but
as
often
as
he
did
this
the
piece
was
raised
to
his
guard
s
shoulder
and
the
words
froze
on
his
lips
the
foremost
wagon
came
along
as
rapidly
as
the
mules
could
draw
it
and
after
what
seemed
an
age
to
leon
the
wagons
were
all
in
view
when
the
leading
wagon
was
almost
opposite
to
him
sprague
raised
his
hand
to
his
mouth
and
gave
a
shrill
whistle
never
in
his
life
had
he
given
a
better
one
he
wasn
t
excited
at
all
there
was
a
moment
s
silence
there
in
the
brush
and
out
popped
the
cavalry
and
infantry
and
in
less
time
that
it
takes
to
tell
it
the
was
surrounded
not
a
shot
was
fired
to
say
that
the
rebels
were
astounded
would
not
half
express
their
feelings
every
teamster
had
three
or
four
guns
looking
at
him
and
the
cavalry
who
occupied
the
advance
of
the
train
were
surrounded
with
horsemen
that
were
two
to
their
one
well
by
george
you
have
done
this
up
in
good
shape
said
the
rebel
captain
after
he
had
taken
time
to
get
his
wits
together
what
are
yes
sir
union
to
the
backbone
replied
sprague
may
i
trouble
you
for
your
sword
and
revolver
that
was
as
neat
a
surprise
as
i
ever
saw
said
the
captain
as
he
unbuckled
his
belt
and
handed
it
to
sprague
you
didn
t
give
us
time
to
fire
a
shot
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
us
put
us
in
jail
no
sir
we
shall
allow
you
to
go
where
you
please
said
sprague
accepting
the
belt
and
fastening
it
about
his
own
waist
we
are
not
making
war
on
your
folks
now
but
on
your
provisions
we
shall
have
to
take
your
horses
too
i
guess
father
s
all
right
and
now
i
ll
get
some
weapons
of
my
own
said
leon
as
he
turned
his
horse
and
rode
along
the
line
of
the
escort
there
must
be
some
rebels
in
there
that
haven
t
given
up
all
their
as
he
rode
along
he
found
a
soldier
on
the
inside
of
the
third
four
who
held
his
weapons
in
his
hand
and
was
looking
around
for
somebody
to
give
them
to
when
he
saw
leon
approaching
he
held
his
sword
revolver
and
carbine
toward
him
over
his
companion
s
horse
come
out
here
said
leon
i
shall
have
to
take
your
horse
as
well
as
your
well
i
can
t
help
it
can
i
said
the
rebel
who
was
more
inclined
to
laugh
than
he
was
to
feel
despondent
over
it
he
came
out
and
proceeded
to
give
up
his
horse
and
weapons
to
leon
and
at
the
same
time
he
took
particular
pains
to
place
himself
on
the
boy
s
side
next
to
the
woods
in
this
way
he
could
talk
to
him
without
his
rebel
friends
hearing
it
say
he
added
you
won
t
take
me
to
jail
will
you
certainly
not
said
leon
don
t
talk
so
loud
i
don
t
want
my
companions
to
know
that
i
have
found
a
friend
among
union
men
let
me
go
out
in
the
woods
a
little
while
and
i
will
come
back
sure
when
you
are
all
ready
to
start
for
you
will
only
be
giving
yourself
trouble
if
you
do
that
said
leon
who
thought
his
rebel
friend
was
taking
a
queer
way
to
escape
as
soon
as
we
get
your
weapons
we
intend
to
turn
you
all
loose
to
go
where
you
but
i
don
t
want
to
go
with
those
rebels
said
the
young
soldier
earnestly
i
am
a
union
man
and
i
went
into
the
army
because
i
had
to
i
will
come
back
well
go
ahead
but
don
t
let
anybody
see
when
leon
led
the
captured
horse
back
to
his
father
s
side
he
found
that
the
escort
had
all
been
dismounted
and
disarmed
and
were
now
standing
there
and
awaiting
further
orders
some
were
disposed
to
be
angry
and
sullen
while
others
were
laughing
over
what
they
considered
a
surprise
sprague
was
highly
elated
over
it
he
did
not
show
it
but
there
was
something
about
him
that
made
leon
feel
happy
too
the
goods
that
were
captured
that
day
must
have
been
worth
now
captain
you
are
all
right
and
i
will
bid
you
said
sprague
you
can
go
ahead
and
as
fast
as
the
teamsters
come
up
we
ll
send
them
on
after
you
silas
go
back
there
and
send
up
all
the
but
suppose
they
don
t
want
to
go
said
silas
then
leave
them
behind
if
they
want
to
go
and
join
the
confederate
army
send
them
up
here
but
if
they
want
to
stay
and
join
the
union
forces
let
them
colonel
i
suppose
i
can
say
what
i
please
can
t
i
said
the
rebel
captain
you
have
got
the
on
me
now
but
it
won
t
be
long
before
i
ll
come
back
then
i
shall
ask
you
for
my
in
a
few
minutes
the
teamsters
began
to
come
up
and
as
they
approached
sprague
told
them
to
fall
in
behind
the
escort
which
was
marching
down
the
road
leon
kept
a
close
watch
on
them
but
didn
t
count
more
than
thirty
who
wanted
to
go
back
to
the
confederacy
there
must
have
been
at
least
ten
of
them
who
wanted
to
stay
with
the
union
men
the
next
thing
was
to
turn
the
mules
around
and
start
back
home
this
occupied
a
good
deal
of
time
for
the
mules
were
balky
and
some
of
them
would
not
back
but
those
five
hundred
men
soon
took
the
balky
out
of
them
and
in
half
an
hour
more
the
wagons
were
all
turned
around
and
the
train
was
on
its
way
to
ellisville
chapter
vi
the
march
homeward
leon
remained
beside
his
father
until
the
wagons
were
turned
around
and
when
he
ordered
the
cavalry
ahead
to
take
its
place
at
the
advance
of
the
column
he
went
with
them
forty
wagons
and
some
of
them
were
loaded
so
heavily
that
four
mules
could
scarcely
draw
them
everybody
was
pleased
with
the
performance
if
all
the
they
captured
were
to
be
taken
as
easily
as
that
they
had
no
fear
but
that
they
should
have
grub
enough
every
driver
s
seat
was
filled
with
men
who
thought
that
they
preferred
riding
to
walking
and
they
all
joined
in
and
sang
at
the
top
of
their
voices
john
brown
s
body
lies
in
the
how
the
song
got
down
there
they
didn
t
know
probably
some
of
those
who
had
been
prisoners
in
the
hands
of
the
federals
and
there
were
a
good
many
old
soldiers
in
the
lot
had
heard
it
sung
by
their
captors
and
now
that
they
were
fighting
for
the
union
they
resolved
to
imitate
them
as
far
as
possible
finally
when
sprague
appeared
riding
along
beside
them
somebody
thought
he
ought
to
be
praised
for
what
he
had
done
so
he
called
out
in
tones
that
were
heard
to
the
farthest
end
of
the
line
three
cheers
for
colonel
sprague
hip
hip
hurrah
all
the
men
immediately
around
there
joined
in
in
cheering
colonel
had
given
him
a
new
title
sprague
took
off
his
hat
as
far
as
he
went
along
the
line
everybody
cheered
him
and
there
was
something
in
their
way
of
talking
to
his
father
that
made
leon
feel
very
happy
he
was
bringing
up
the
rear
leading
his
captured
horse
as
he
went
until
he
found
himself
opposite
a
wagon
managed
by
his
friend
tom
howe
leon
was
glad
to
see
him
for
he
had
not
spoken
with
him
since
they
left
ellisville
there
were
three
men
on
the
driver
s
seat
and
tom
was
sitting
on
the
knees
of
one
and
handling
the
reins
over
his
team
as
if
he
had
been
used
to
it
all
his
life
g
lang
here
he
shouted
when
he
saw
leon
riding
by
we
don
t
take
no
slack
from
anybody
but
say
leon
you
will
stand
by
me
won
t
you
of
course
i
will
stand
by
you
said
leon
but
i
don
t
know
what
you
do
you
see
that
leading
muel
there
that
white
one
said
tom
pointing
out
the
animal
in
question
well
that
s
mine
there
ain
t
been
anybody
to
lay
a
claim
to
him
and
i
want
i
guess
you
can
have
him
said
leon
but
why
don
t
you
take
a
horse
i
would
rather
have
the
muel
than
that
horse
you
are
leading
by
the
bits
where
did
you
get
him
i
got
these
weapons
said
leon
showing
the
revolver
and
sword
he
carried
about
his
waist
and
the
carbine
he
held
in
his
hand
from
a
young
fellow
who
gave
them
up
to
me
without
being
asked
he
has
gone
off
in
the
bushes
now
to
get
out
of
sight
of
the
other
members
of
the
escort
but
he
ll
be
back
who
let
him
go
into
the
bushes
inquired
one
of
the
men
who
was
sitting
on
the
driver
s
seat
with
tom
i
well
he
has
taken
a
rough
way
to
escape
why
didn
t
he
stay
here
and
march
away
with
his
squad
but
he
don
t
want
to
escape
said
leon
he
is
a
union
man
and
he
wants
to
go
home
with
you
are
the
most
confiding
man
i
ever
saw
you
will
never
see
him
then
i
shall
have
a
horse
and
weapons
to
give
to
somebody
who
needs
them
i
don
t
need
them
myself
when
you
want
to
get
that
mule
tom
you
come
to
i
ll
do
it
said
tom
as
he
unwound
his
lash
and
gave
the
leading
white
mule
a
cut
with
the
whip
to
make
him
pull
faster
whereupon
the
mule
s
ears
came
back
and
he
kicked
with
both
hind
feet
in
the
direction
of
the
wagon
barely
missing
the
s
head
leon
laughed
heartily
well
you
see
he
hasn
t
been
taught
to
pull
in
a
wagon
this
is
his
first
attempt
but
he
is
gay
on
horseback
and
i
ll
bet
on
it
i
ll
teach
him
in
two
days
so
that
he
won
t
leon
urged
his
horse
on
ahead
to
catch
up
with
the
cavalry
but
he
had
not
made
many
steps
before
the
bushes
parted
at
his
side
and
the
young
rebel
who
owned
the
steed
he
was
leading
came
out
have
they
gone
said
he
and
he
acted
like
one
who
felt
overjoyed
i
told
you
i
would
come
back
and
here
i
am
may
i
get
up
and
ride
my
horse
certainly
said
leon
and
he
felt
so
delighted
to
see
the
rebel
that
he
could
have
hugged
him
he
didn
t
know
what
his
father
would
say
to
him
for
allowing
that
man
to
go
out
in
the
bushes
he
gave
up
the
horse
and
the
young
fellow
swung
himself
into
the
saddle
i
am
glad
you
didn
t
give
him
up
to
some
of
your
men
who
have
no
horses
of
their
own
said
the
rebel
as
he
accompanied
leon
toward
the
head
of
the
column
my
father
raised
this
animal
i
broke
him
myself
and
he
s
got
just
the
kind
of
a
gait
that
i
like
now
what
are
you
going
to
do
here
in
this
county
are
you
going
to
rebel
against
the
confederacy
sure
enough
we
have
gone
out
already
said
leon
i
haven
t
got
a
copy
of
the
resolutions
with
me
but
you
can
see
them
when
you
get
up
to
it
beats
anything
i
ever
heard
of
exclaimed
the
rebel
who
burst
out
laughing
every
time
he
thought
of
it
the
idea
that
one
county
in
the
very
heart
of
the
southern
confederacy
should
cut
loose
from
it
and
say
that
they
are
union
men
beats
my
time
all
holler
i
told
my
father
about
where
is
your
father
now
interrupted
leon
he
is
in
the
rebel
was
he
conscripted
no
we
didn
t
wait
for
that
but
we
heard
enough
to
let
us
know
what
jeff
davis
was
going
to
do
more
than
that
some
of
our
neighbors
began
to
talk
about
hanging
those
who
did
not
believe
as
they
did
to
the
plates
of
their
own
gallery
and
as
we
could
get
into
the
cavalry
by
enlisting
then
we
rode
down
to
the
one
day
and
gave
our
names
have
you
been
in
any
fights
two
or
three
but
mind
you
i
always
shot
high
i
never
drew
a
bullet
on
a
union
man
in
my
life
i
live
only
three
or
four
miles
from
where
you
stopped
us
and
i
really
wish
the
authorities
of
jones
county
would
give
me
permission
to
go
back
and
get
my
do
you
think
your
father
would
come
up
here
after
that
of
course
he
would
we
have
done
nothing
but
think
and
talk
about
what
you
fellows
are
doing
here
ever
since
we
have
been
in
the
army
there
was
a
distinct
understanding
between
my
father
and
myself
that
whoever
escaped
first
should
bring
my
mother
well
began
leon
dawson
is
my
name
said
the
rebel
if
you
turn
out
to
be
all
right
i
will
go
with
you
said
leon
will
you
exclaimed
the
rebel
so
highly
excited
that
he
could
hardly
speak
plainly
i
know
we
will
succeed
for
you
have
been
in
fights
enough
to
know
what
it
i
don
t
understand
you
said
leon
this
is
as
near
as
i
have
come
to
being
in
a
what
capturing
our
you
don
t
tell
me
well
i
have
seen
men
who
had
been
in
three
or
four
battles
that
showed
more
nervousness
than
you
did
you
were
not
excited
a
leon
very
wisely
concluded
that
he
would
not
say
anything
more
on
this
subject
just
then
he
never
was
more
excited
in
his
life
than
when
he
rode
along
the
line
and
demanded
the
rebel
s
weapons
if
dawson
thought
he
wasn
t
excited
so
much
the
better
for
him
i
certainly
thought
you
had
been
where
you
had
seen
men
knocked
down
by
the
said
dawson
looking
at
leon
to
see
what
he
was
made
of
i
have
been
where
i
have
seen
a
whole
platoon
laid
out
at
one
fire
but
i
never
go
into
action
without
feeling
afraid
after
this
trouble
is
all
over
i
would
like
to
compare
notes
with
to
see
how
many
times
i
am
afraid
asked
leon
i
don
t
care
to
compare
notes
with
you
on
that
for
i
know
i
shall
feel
afraid
all
the
time
i
ve
got
one
chum
here
who
won
t
haul
in
his
shingle
one
inch
to
please
anybody
and
we
ll
ask
him
to
go
with
two
men
are
all
we
want
said
dawson
by
the
way
there
was
a
friend
of
mine
deserted
the
camp
night
before
last
and
he
stole
the
s
horse
to
help
him
along
i
don
t
suppose
you
have
seen
anything
of
him
have
you
we
have
a
rebel
up
to
ellisville
and
he
says
that
was
the
way
he
got
away
but
his
horse
and
weapons
have
been
taken
from
that
s
all
right
you
wanted
him
to
prove
to
you
that
he
was
before
you
let
him
have
his
but
he
s
all
he
told
you
about
this
i
never
saw
him
in
a
fight
with
federals
when
he
pretended
to
show
any
vim
about
it
but
you
give
him
rebels
to
shoot
at
and
you
ll
hear
something
drop
he
hasn
t
got
the
smallest
sympathy
for
a
confederate
why
they
had
him
with
a
rope
around
his
neck
and
were
going
to
hang
he
never
said
anything
to
us
about
that
said
leon
in
surprise
it
happened
on
the
very
morning
that
father
and
i
went
down
to
enlist
said
dawson
and
the
way
they
acted
made
us
believe
that
when
they
got
through
with
him
they
were
coming
to
see
us
we
rushed
into
his
house
and
did
some
good
talking
to
save
the
man
s
neck
and
when
they
let
him
go
he
got
onto
his
horse
and
went
down
to
the
with
us
but
didn
t
he
give
the
rebels
a
good
blessing
he
could
say
what
he
had
a
mind
to
in
your
presence
i
suppose
yes
sir
and
he
laid
down
the
law
in
good
shape
i
tell
you
there
are
six
men
he
wants
to
find
and
they
are
the
men
who
had
the
rope
around
his
neck
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
the
prisoners
you
capture
in
battle
i
am
sure
i
don
t
know
said
leon
with
a
laugh
we
haven
t
got
any
you
haven
t
been
in
a
fight
yet
how
many
men
have
you
we
had
about
three
hundred
fighting
men
but
first
one
union
family
has
come
in
and
then
another
until
we
have
a
thousand
men
able
to
bear
arms
father
said
that
about
three
hundred
fighting
men
were
all
we
had
when
this
war
broke
out
about
a
year
ago
but
they
have
been
coming
in
from
all
sides
one
man
i
know
here
has
come
from
the
mountains
of
tennessee
i
tell
you
we
are
going
to
make
a
good
fight
if
the
rebels
get
after
i
believe
you
and
these
men
you
have
now
won
t
be
a
patching
to
what
you
will
have
by
and
by
but
say
added
dawson
as
they
drew
up
in
the
rear
of
the
cavalry
do
you
really
think
you
will
be
able
to
go
with
me
to
get
my
mother
that
depends
entirely
on
what
my
father
says
if
he
continues
to
let
me
do
as
i
please
as
he
always
has
done
i
ll
go
with
you
there
is
no
chance
of
being
captured
down
there
i
suppose
not
in
the
least
mobile
is
their
nearest
headquarters
and
we
can
slip
in
there
and
get
away
again
without
any
one
being
the
wiser
for
it
it
can
be
done
just
as
easy
as
falling
off
a
well
you
stay
here
and
i
will
go
on
and
ride
by
my
father
i
will
tell
him
about
you
and
see
what
he
has
to
leon
turned
out
and
hurried
on
ahead
to
meet
his
father
who
was
riding
alone
in
advance
of
the
column
with
his
hat
drawn
over
his
eyes
as
if
he
were
thinking
deeply
when
he
saw
who
the
was
he
pushed
back
his
hat
and
beamed
upon
him
with
a
smile
that
reminded
the
boy
of
old
times
i
tell
you
father
you
have
done
one
good
act
in
capturing
this
train
said
leon
what
were
you
thinking
of
oh
there
are
lots
of
things
to
come
after
this
said
sprague
we
have
got
to
whip
the
rebels
in
order
to
keep
the
train
where
s
your
horse
the
owner
has
got
him
and
taking
this
as
his
leon
went
on
to
give
his
father
as
much
of
the
history
of
dawson
as
he
was
acquainted
with
when
he
told
about
the
rebels
having
a
rope
around
the
neck
of
that
man
in
camp
his
father
was
hardly
prepared
to
believe
it
but
do
you
think
the
man
honest
asked
sprague
i
know
he
is
no
boy
could
talk
as
feelingly
of
his
mother
as
he
did
and
tell
a
lie
about
it
now
if
you
will
let
me
go
down
there
and
bring
his
family
up
here
we
will
make
two
good
soldiers
by
the
we
will
see
about
it
when
the
time
comes
said
sprague
that
was
enough
for
leon
who
reined
his
horse
out
of
the
road
and
halted
until
dawson
came
up
somehow
he
had
taken
a
great
fancy
for
the
young
rebel
there
was
something
so
honest
about
him
that
leon
put
strong
faith
in
everything
he
said
he
drew
up
beside
dawson
and
the
latter
s
face
grew
more
radiant
than
ever
when
leon
said
that
his
father
would
see
about
that
is
as
good
as
saying
that
i
may
go
if
something
doesn
t
turn
up
in
the
meantime
now
the
next
thing
will
be
to
get
tom
to
go
with
us
i
shall
feel
a
heap
better
with
him
alongside
of
it
was
a
long
journey
toward
ellisville
and
the
mules
walked
so
slowly
that
it
was
almost
midnight
when
they
got
there
following
the
instructions
of
sprague
the
wagons
were
drawn
up
in
a
park
in
the
grove
the
mules
were
watered
at
the
river
and
staked
out
where
they
had
plenty
of
food
and
the
men
left
of
their
own
accord
and
went
to
bed
there
was
no
posting
of
sentries
about
the
wagons
to
see
that
some
backwoodsman
did
not
slip
up
there
to
steal
anything
for
such
a
thing
as
theft
was
never
heard
of
in
that
county
they
knew
that
the
things
would
be
in
the
wagons
in
the
morning
in
just
as
good
shape
as
they
were
then
when
leon
and
dawson
after
hitching
their
horses
and
foddering
them
turned
to
go
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
grove
the
place
where
that
rebel
was
under
guard
they
came
across
tom
howe
who
had
his
coat
off
and
was
building
a
fire
why
tom
come
with
us
said
leon
i
am
going
to
get
something
to
eat
before
i
go
to
well
sir
you
can
go
and
get
it
for
you
are
one
of
these
hungry
fellows
who
always
want
something
replied
tom
do
you
see
that
muel
i
ain
t
to
take
my
eyes
off
of
him
until
your
father
gives
him
into
my
you
haven
t
had
any
supper
have
you
nary
supper
and
i
ain
t
to
have
any
either
until
i
get
that
there
muel
in
my
you
can
come
back
here
and
sleep
tom
this
is
dawson
whom
i
want
you
to
be
friends
with
he
was
in
that
squad
but
he
gave
up
his
horse
and
weapons
to
me
without
being
the
moment
leon
referred
to
dawson
tom
put
his
hands
behind
his
back
as
if
he
didn
t
want
to
say
how
glad
he
was
to
see
him
leon
noticed
the
movement
and
went
on
with
something
which
he
knew
would
bring
tom
to
his
senses
tom
had
a
mother
his
father
was
dead
and
he
fairly
worshipped
her
he
is
going
down
after
his
mother
and
i
am
going
too
and
we
want
you
to
go
with
howdy
exclaimed
tom
and
his
hands
came
out
and
he
shook
dawson
as
if
he
was
a
friend
from
whom
he
had
long
been
separated
then
he
s
all
right
of
course
i
ll
go
but
you
must
get
my
muel
for
the
boys
bent
their
steps
toward
the
hotel
for
they
knew
that
the
landlord
was
a
man
who
was
determined
to
do
what
he
could
to
help
along
the
cause
he
knew
that
at
least
a
portion
of
the
men
who
had
gone
out
to
capture
that
had
no
place
to
get
anything
to
eat
and
he
cooked
up
a
lot
of
food
for
them
and
had
it
spread
out
on
his
tables
he
had
remained
up
all
night
and
the
noise
the
men
made
when
they
returned
almost
drove
him
wild
who
said
those
who
took
part
with
us
in
this
useless
struggle
would
go
hungry
said
he
standing
on
the
porch
and
welcoming
the
men
as
they
came
up
and
sending
them
all
into
the
ah
here
s
leon
and
tom
howe
i
declare
where
did
you
get
shot
boys
and
a
rebel
as
sure
as
i
am
a
foot
high
where
did
you
take
him
up
i
am
a
rebel
no
longer
replied
dawson
in
spite
of
my
clothes
i
am
as
good
a
union
man
as
there
is
in
the
you
are
just
the
lads
we
want
said
the
landlord
haven
t
had
anything
to
eat
yet
no
dinner
either
then
go
right
into
the
you
will
find
the
president
and
the
secretary
of
war
in
the
boys
went
in
and
found
the
two
officers
sitting
in
a
remote
corner
engaged
in
earnest
conversation
they
talked
in
low
tones
and
it
was
evident
that
they
did
not
want
anybody
to
hear
what
they
were
discussing
so
the
boys
sat
down
and
began
an
attack
upon
the
food
the
way
the
landlord
s
bacon
eggs
and
disappeared
before
them
would
have
astonished
that
gentleman
could
he
have
witnessed
it
it
made
no
difference
to
them
that
the
food
was
cold
for
the
coffee
was
hot
and
they
finally
stopped
because
they
were
ashamed
to
eat
any
more
by
the
time
they
had
finished
eating
their
supper
the
two
high
officers
ceased
their
consultation
and
sprague
hauled
up
a
chair
to
the
nearest
table
and
sat
down
leon
decided
that
this
was
his
time
tom
howe
would
certainly
sleep
better
if
he
knew
that
the
mule
was
his
own
father
there
s
a
white
mule
out
there
in
the
train
and
tom
howe
wants
well
he
can
have
him
i
guess
said
sprague
anybody
else
laid
any
claim
to
him
no
sir
tom
is
the
only
one
and
he
has
taken
a
mighty
queer
animal
to
carry
him
through
this
war
he
tom
will
have
to
manage
that
to
suit
himself
why
don
t
he
wait
until
we
can
capture
a
horse
because
he
would
rather
have
that
mule
than
anything
tell
him
to
take
him
and
leon
found
his
companions
in
the
and
when
he
told
them
that
the
secretary
of
war
had
given
tom
the
mule
he
wanted
tom
was
delighted
he
promised
the
others
that
he
would
get
to
work
early
in
the
morning
to
break
him
of
kicking
and
wanted
them
to
come
over
and
see
how
it
was
done
and
then
turned
away
to
his
own
camp
while
leon
and
dawson
started
out
to
find
the
camp
of
the
rebel
who
was
kept
under
guard
there
s
his
right
there
said
leon
after
walking
some
distance
up
the
road
do
you
see
any
comparison
between
that
sentry
and
the
ones
you
left
behind
i
mean
do
they
sit
down
and
warm
themselves
by
a
fire
when
they
are
left
on
duty
not
much
they
don
t
answered
dawson
with
a
laugh
if
you
had
our
officer
of
the
day
here
he
would
snatch
that
fellow
he
ought
to
get
up
hold
his
arms
at
support
and
pace
his
who
is
it
that
the
officer
of
the
day
is
going
to
snatch
asked
the
sentry
he
sat
on
a
log
with
his
rifle
beside
him
and
he
was
warming
his
hands
over
the
fire
he
seemed
to
think
that
he
could
see
everything
that
was
going
on
and
he
thought
that
was
all
that
was
required
of
him
the
officer
of
the
rebel
army
if
there
was
one
here
would
take
you
to
task
for
not
pacing
your
beat
said
leon
sho
what
would
he
do
that
for
asked
the
man
that
rebel
hasn
t
moved
in
there
without
my
seeing
him
and
he
can
t
get
away
say
johnny
are
you
asleep
no
i
am
wide
awake
shouted
a
voice
from
the
inside
i
wanted
to
see
the
men
that
came
back
with
that
dawson
exclaimed
the
rebel
who
when
he
came
out
caught
sight
of
his
old
comrade
in
arms
you
re
here
ain
t
you
the
two
men
shook
hands
as
though
they
had
not
seen
each
other
for
years
dawson
then
explained
how
the
capture
was
effected
and
the
rebel
s
eyes
fairly
flashed
as
he
listened
to
it
when
he
ceased
speaking
the
rebel
asked
permission
for
dawson
to
come
under
his
and
share
his
blankets
with
him
and
as
the
sentry
did
not
find
any
fault
leon
readily
granted
it
when
he
had
seen
the
two
tuck
themselves
away
preparatory
to
a
good
sleep
and
had
exchanged
a
few
words
with
their
guard
leon
turned
about
and
made
the
best
of
his
way
to
the
hotel
chapter
vii
breaking
the
mule
what
sprague
was
talking
about
when
leon
and
his
companions
went
in
to
eat
their
suppers
was
whether
or
not
it
would
be
a
good
plan
to
send
a
party
of
cavalrymen
say
a
dozen
or
more
down
to
the
little
creek
that
separated
the
two
counties
to
bring
them
warning
of
a
confederate
force
which
was
coming
to
subdue
them
for
sprague
was
certain
that
those
men
would
be
along
before
a
great
while
the
rebels
were
not
the
men
to
stand
still
and
allow
themselves
to
be
robbed
of
their
scouts
will
be
a
long
ways
ahead
of
the
main
body
and
by
the
time
they
get
here
we
can
be
safe
in
the
swamp
said
sprague
the
cavalrymen
are
all
good
shots
and
by
the
time
they
get
through
with
one
fire
there
won
t
be
so
many
of
them
to
follow
up
our
they
will
shoot
them
down
i
suppose
said
knight
of
course
they
will
have
to
take
their
chances
on
that
while
all
the
rest
of
them
are
asleep
one
of
them
can
be
standing
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
plan
we
ll
send
cavalrymen
down
there
every
morning
to
relieve
them
perhaps
you
had
better
detail
some
guards
for
morning
but
do
you
say
you
captured
that
train
without
firing
a
shot
it
is
the
truth
said
sprague
one
of
the
soldiers
said
it
was
the
prettiest
surprise
he
every
saw
the
men
were
all
prompt
and
they
obeyed
my
whistle
just
like
the
next
morning
when
leon
awoke
and
stretched
himself
on
the
bench
which
served
him
in
lieu
of
a
bed
he
felt
like
a
new
man
he
was
not
accustomed
to
spending
so
many
hours
in
the
saddle
his
long
ride
of
the
day
before
had
wearied
him
and
when
he
went
to
slumber
he
slept
for
keeps
as
he
expressed
it
he
got
up
and
after
washing
his
hands
and
face
went
out
on
the
porch
and
saw
a
party
of
a
dozen
men
gathered
about
a
tree
a
short
distance
away
there
was
a
white
mule
in
the
party
and
three
or
four
men
were
fussing
around
her
tom
has
got
to
work
to
break
the
muel
as
lie
calls
it
from
kicking
said
leon
and
i
am
going
down
to
see
how
it
is
done
he
thinks
he
has
got
a
prize
there
and
i
hope
he
when
leon
got
up
with
the
crowd
he
found
that
the
mule
had
been
securely
fastened
to
a
tree
and
that
there
were
two
men
engaged
in
holding
her
head
up
you
may
have
noticed
that
when
a
mule
wants
to
kick
she
always
puts
her
head
down
and
by
holding
her
head
up
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
kick
tom
who
by
bringing
her
tail
around
by
her
side
was
busy
in
tying
a
stone
that
weighed
two
or
three
pounds
and
was
wrapped
up
in
a
thick
rag
so
that
it
would
not
bruise
her
heels
fast
to
the
end
of
it
leon
saw
through
the
plan
at
once
and
he
laughed
heartily
there
now
i
reckon
we
re
all
right
said
tom
as
he
took
a
finishing
knot
in
the
string
with
which
the
stone
was
tied
kick
now
and
we
will
see
how
you
will
come
out
let
go
her
head
when
tom
said
this
he
raised
the
stone
and
let
it
down
against
the
mule
s
heels
with
a
sounding
whack
and
the
men
let
go
their
hold
and
backed
away
in
an
instant
you
could
not
have
told
where
that
mule
belonged
her
heels
were
in
the
air
all
the
time
but
no
matter
how
high
the
stone
went
it
always
came
down
and
the
further
it
went
it
came
back
to
its
place
and
punished
her
heels
severely
sometimes
she
seemed
as
if
she
would
kick
herself
over
her
head
she
stood
up
so
straight
the
men
stood
around
and
laughed
heartily
until
the
mule
after
trying
in
vain
to
rid
herself
of
the
contrivance
stopped
her
kicking
and
turned
around
and
looked
at
it
she
seemed
to
know
that
it
was
fast
to
her
and
after
looking
first
on
one
side
and
then
on
the
other
and
trying
with
more
energy
than
before
to
throw
off
the
useless
appendage
which
she
knew
did
not
belong
there
she
drew
her
haunches
under
her
looked
at
tom
and
broke
out
into
a
faint
bray
as
if
begging
him
to
take
it
off
there
sir
she
is
done
with
her
kicking
for
all
time
said
one
of
the
men
tom
said
leon
don
t
go
near
her
you
know
how
treacherous
a
mule
can
the
man
promptly
stepped
up
to
the
mule
undid
the
stone
lifted
her
tail
and
did
other
pranks
which
would
have
led
even
a
mule
who
did
not
know
how
to
kick
to
lay
back
her
ears
i
said
i
would
break
her
of
kicking
in
less
than
two
days
and
we
have
broken
her
in
less
than
half
an
hour
said
tom
gleefully
now
watch
me
and
see
me
ride
to
tom
mounted
in
regular
texas
fashion
placing
his
left
hand
upon
the
mule
s
shoulder
and
throwing
his
right
leg
over
her
back
and
with
a
g
lang
there
muel
went
down
the
road
at
a
furious
pace
she
loped
beautifully
and
tom
wasn
t
even
moved
although
he
rode
leon
was
satisfied
that
he
had
got
a
prize
after
all
now
all
he
wants
is
to
go
around
that
mule
forty
times
a
day
lifting
her
tail
and
patting
her
and
she
won
t
kick
him
said
the
man
who
undid
the
stone
i
just
know
for
i
ll
bet
on
when
leon
had
seen
the
mule
broken
and
tom
ride
away
he
turned
his
steps
toward
the
camp
of
the
rebels
to
see
how
they
were
getting
on
there
was
another
sentry
on
guard
this
time
and
he
was
engaged
in
a
favorite
occupation
sitting
on
a
log
with
his
rifle
beside
him
smoking
a
cob
pipe
and
warming
his
hands
at
the
fire
the
two
rebels
were
standing
in
the
door
of
the
and
they
greeted
leon
heartily
after
exchanging
a
few
words
with
them
leon
said
i
am
going
to
speak
to
father
about
you
and
i
think
he
will
let
you
out
i
am
going
home
this
morning
and
i
want
dawson
to
ride
with
if
he
lets
me
out
i
will
go
and
be
glad
of
the
chance
said
dawson
but
what
are
you
going
home
for
to
let
my
mother
know
that
i
shan
t
be
home
i
reckon
we
are
going
down
after
your
by
george
that
s
the
best
news
i
have
heard
since
i
have
been
a
prisoner
exclaimed
dawson
you
will
see
father
here
in
less
than
a
week
and
you
don
t
want
to
let
him
get
into
any
fight
where
the
rebels
are
he
don
t
take
any
leon
next
bent
his
steps
toward
the
hotel
to
get
his
breakfast
in
the
he
met
the
landlord
who
had
three
or
four
men
around
him
and
was
talking
gleefully
of
the
manner
in
which
the
had
been
captured
the
day
before
to
think
that
our
boys
never
fired
a
shot
and
there
were
of
them
rebels
who
were
hired
to
defend
it
said
he
now
here
s
leon
he
added
taking
the
boy
s
right
hand
in
his
own
throwing
his
left
arm
around
his
shoulder
and
affectionately
drawing
him
up
to
his
side
who
would
think
that
this
boy
would
watch
over
his
father
he
gets
close
up
to
his
side
and
if
anyone
pops
him
over
he
is
going
to
see
about
you
will
have
to
get
away
from
this
place
faulkner
said
leon
your
house
is
right
on
the
main
road
and
the
first
party
of
rebels
who
come
in
here
will
set
fire
to
i
know
all
about
that
said
faulkner
with
a
laugh
i
expect
everything
i
have
got
will
go
up
in
smoke
but
you
see
they
won
t
burn
anything
but
the
house
your
father
is
going
to
lend
me
some
of
the
wagons
as
soon
as
they
are
unloaded
and
i
am
going
to
pile
on
everything
i
have
got
and
take
them
all
up
to
the
swamp
i
should
like
to
see
the
rebels
get
them
out
of
so
would
i
said
leon
i
can
t
give
you
as
good
a
breakfast
as
i
could
once
added
faulkner
bacon
eggs
and
am
almost
out
of
coffee
now
that
i
think
of
it
i
shall
be
all
out
if
you
haven
t
got
some
in
those
wagons
you
captured
yesterday
go
on
and
get
your
breakfast
the
whole
of
you
there
s
many
a
better
man
than
you
and
i
dare
be
who
is
living
on
worse
food
and
he
s
just
as
good
a
union
man
as
though
he
stood
in
our
leon
went
into
the
and
found
his
father
and
knight
sitting
there
by
themselves
and
he
concluded
that
it
was
a
good
time
to
talk
to
them
about
the
rebels
who
were
kept
under
guard
i
have
been
thinking
about
them
all
the
morning
said
sprague
when
leon
had
explained
things
to
him
and
i
don
t
see
the
need
of
keeping
them
under
guard
any
longer
do
you
knight
no
i
don
t
i
say
let
them
well
i
will
go
back
with
you
and
turn
them
loose
said
sprague
that
will
be
the
way
we
ll
work
it
as
fast
as
any
rebels
come
in
here
and
say
they
are
on
our
side
we
ll
take
their
weapons
and
horses
away
from
them
if
they
have
any
and
hold
them
until
they
prove
that
they
are
just
as
they
should
well
what
do
you
say
to
my
going
down
to
dawson
s
house
after
his
mother
said
leon
what
do
you
think
about
it
knight
why
i
say
let
the
boy
go
he
has
proved
long
ago
that
he
knows
how
to
handle
himself
in
a
tight
place
yesterday
for
instance
and
he
will
be
just
as
safe
as
he
would
be
here
in
camp
by
the
way
leon
we
have
given
your
father
a
new
title
he
says
the
secretary
of
war
is
too
long
for
him
and
so
we
have
promoted
him
to
colonel
he
likes
that
better
maybe
if
you
conduct
yourself
all
right
he
will
make
you
we
are
sorry
to
say
that
knight
did
not
pronounce
this
word
correctly
and
if
there
had
been
some
boys
like
you
who
are
fresh
from
their
books
they
would
have
seen
a
good
many
other
words
whose
spelling
bothered
him
but
he
knew
one
thing
that
had
evidently
slipped
the
president
s
mind
if
his
father
had
been
promoted
to
colonel
leon
thought
that
was
being
promoted
backwards
but
then
this
thing
would
not
last
more
than
a
year
or
two
and
it
did
not
make
much
difference
to
him
what
people
said
about
it
he
got
no
money
for
the
position
he
held
none
of
the
officers
got
any
and
he
was
willing
to
do
what
he
could
for
the
sake
of
the
county
i
don
t
care
if
my
father
never
promotes
me
to
anything
said
leon
if
he
will
let
me
stay
close
by
him
so
as
to
be
on
hand
if
anything
happens
to
him
i
shall
be
the
party
having
finished
their
breakfast
arose
from
the
table
at
the
same
time
and
sprague
went
out
with
leon
to
call
upon
the
rebels
on
the
way
he
talked
more
plainly
to
leon
than
he
had
ever
done
before
i
shan
t
appoint
you
said
sprague
i
know
why
said
leon
if
you
should
do
a
thing
like
that
the
fellows
who
are
not
as
high
in
authority
as
you
are
would
think
that
you
were
giving
me
a
place
to
keep
me
out
of
danger
i
don
t
want
anybody
to
think
that
of
well
yes
that
has
something
to
do
with
it
but
you
would
be
in
just
as
much
danger
there
as
you
would
anywhere
else
i
don
t
want
you
hanging
around
me
all
the
time
the
men
think
you
are
doing
it
on
purpose
to
shield
i
confess
that
that
is
what
i
was
thinking
don
t
do
it
any
more
of
course
i
shall
be
in
the
thickest
of
the
fight
if
we
have
any
but
i
don
t
want
you
to
be
there
that
s
the
reason
i
am
giving
my
consent
to
allow
you
to
go
down
after
dawson
s
do
you
say
i
may
go
exclaimed
leon
joyfully
yes
but
i
want
you
first
to
let
your
mother
know
we
are
safe
and
what
is
the
reason
we
don
t
come
i
ll
go
and
get
tom
and
dawson
to
go
with
me
by
the
way
tom
has
got
his
mule
so
that
he
won
t
kick
asked
sprague
in
surprise
yes
sir
and
he
broke
him
in
less
than
half
an
leon
then
went
on
to
tell
how
tom
had
operated
to
break
the
mule
and
when
he
described
her
kicking
he
made
his
father
laugh
heartily
by
this
time
they
had
reached
the
lean
to
and
found
the
two
rebels
enjoying
their
breakfast
they
arose
to
their
feet
as
sprague
approached
knowing
that
the
secretary
of
war
had
much
authority
over
their
prisoners
but
he
motioned
them
to
keep
their
seats
even
the
sentry
got
up
put
down
his
the
rebels
had
helped
him
most
held
his
rifle
in
a
way
that
was
intended
to
present
arms
but
then
the
secretary
didn
t
know
whether
the
motion
was
properly
executed
or
not
he
touched
his
hat
however
and
after
bidding
the
rebels
and
lifting
his
hat
once
more
out
of
respect
to
the
woman
who
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
he
turned
again
to
the
sentry
i
would
like
to
see
all
the
men
who
are
on
guard
with
you
said
he
they
are
around
here
i
suppose
oh
yes
sir
they
are
around
here
said
the
sentry
then
lifting
his
voice
he
called
out
all
you
guards
turn
out
the
secretary
of
war
wants
you
come
the
men
came
in
a
hurry
three
of
them
some
bareheaded
some
swinging
on
their
as
they
hastened
through
the
bushes
and
all
eager
to
see
what
the
secretary
of
war
wanted
like
the
good
soldiers
they
were
they
concluded
that
there
was
some
business
to
engage
in
and
they
were
impatient
to
do
it
but
when
they
found
out
what
he
wanted
they
were
just
as
pleased
all
the
same
sprague
told
them
in
so
many
words
that
the
rebels
were
all
right
and
from
this
time
they
were
released
from
all
sentry
duty
the
rebels
were
just
as
free
in
their
camp
as
they
were
themselves
colonel
i
want
to
shake
your
hand
for
that
said
the
owner
of
the
and
as
he
spoke
he
got
up
from
the
table
and
came
out
now
i
want
all
of
you
boys
to
understand
one
thing
you
have
done
nothing
but
call
me
johnny
ever
since
i
have
been
in
camp
and
now
i
want
you
to
stop
it
my
name
is
roberts
and
i
am
as
good
a
union
man
as
the
best
of
you
if
you
don
t
believe
it
wait
until
we
get
into
a
fight
and
i
will
show
all
this
was
said
in
a
perfectly
way
and
the
guards
on
being
sent
back
to
their
promised
that
they
would
address
him
as
roberts
ever
afterward
they
had
called
him
johnny
because
they
did
not
know
any
other
name
for
him
now
dawson
i
am
going
to
start
for
home
said
leon
come
with
me
and
i
will
get
your
horse
and
weapons
for
when
leon
and
dawson
turned
away
the
former
was
surprised
to
see
standing
at
his
side
another
boy
newman
by
name
who
was
enough
like
carl
swayne
to
have
been
his
brother
except
in
one
particular
newman
did
not
proclaim
himself
so
much
in
favor
of
the
secessionists
as
carl
did
but
in
every
other
way
so
far
as
meanness
was
concerned
they
were
a
good
team
leon
was
not
the
only
one
about
there
who
believed
that
newman
was
a
rebel
at
heart
and
that
if
he
had
his
way
he
would
have
arrested
every
union
man
in
the
county
he
noticed
that
newman
did
not
go
with
them
when
they
assaulted
the
had
something
else
that
demanded
his
immediate
attention
but
he
noticed
too
that
when
the
expedition
came
back
newman
had
as
much
to
say
as
anybody
there
was
one
thing
about
newman
that
did
not
look
exactly
right
to
leon
in
the
early
part
of
the
year
when
there
was
a
good
deal
of
talk
about
the
secession
of
jones
county
this
newman
s
father
had
piled
all
his
worldly
goods
into
a
wagon
and
started
for
mobile
but
in
two
months
time
he
came
back
there
was
more
fighting
going
on
there
than
there
was
in
jones
county
he
said
and
as
he
was
a
man
of
peace
and
did
not
believe
in
contests
of
any
kind
he
thought
he
and
his
family
had
better
come
back
and
stay
in
their
own
house
until
the
trouble
was
over
mind
you
that
was
the
story
he
told
whether
or
not
it
was
the
truth
remains
to
be
seen
well
leon
we
got
em
didn
t
we
was
the
way
in
which
newman
began
the
conversation
got
whom
inquired
leon
and
he
was
not
very
civil
about
it
either
he
wished
that
newman
would
keep
to
his
own
side
of
the
walk
and
let
him
alone
why
the
rebels
of
course
said
newman
you
have
got
one
them
with
you
right
how
many
of
them
did
you
capture
inquired
leon
poking
his
elbow
into
dawson
s
ribs
when
he
saw
that
he
was
about
to
reply
i
captured
one
but
i
let
him
go
you
know
the
president
said
we
wasn
t
going
to
take
any
yes
i
know
but
what
made
you
let
him
go
oh
he
told
me
such
a
funny
story
about
his
wife
being
sick
and
all
that
that
i
couldn
t
bear
to
keep
him
captive
so
i
just
told
him
to
clear
and
you
let
him
take
his
weapons
with
him
of
course
replied
newman
and
then
finding
that
leon
was
getting
onto
rather
dangerous
ground
he
changed
the
subject
for
he
had
come
there
to
ask
a
favor
say
leon
do
you
suppose
that
your
father
would
give
me
one
of
them
muels
that
we
captured
yesterday
i
reckon
i
ve
got
as
much
right
to
them
as
he
well
i
reckon
you
haven
t
replied
leon
indignantly
just
because
he
s
a
high
officer
do
you
think
he
has
more
right
to
property
that
we
capture
than
them
that
takes
it
asked
newman
getting
mad
in
his
turn
he
gave
tom
howe
a
muel
and
tom
didn
t
do
any
more
than
i
what
s
the
use
of
telling
such
an
outrageous
falsehood
you
was
not
there
did
you
see
me
yes
i
saw
what
did
i
do
did
you
see
me
when
i
ran
from
this
man
and
he
followed
after
me
swinging
his
sword
in
his
hand
eh
oh
yes
i
saw
you
said
newman
looking
surprised
he
came
pretty
near
catching
you
too
and
he
would
if
that
man
hadn
t
come
up
and
poked
a
revolver
in
his
face
who
was
that
do
you
know
well
newman
i
don
t
believe
you
can
get
a
mule
to
ride
during
this
war
said
leon
once
more
turning
his
steps
towards
the
hotel
you
see
tom
wants
to
do
something
with
this
mule
and
you
don
t
you
simply
want
him
to
ride
around
and
when
the
fight
comes
you
will
be
miles
away
that
is
if
you
are
on
our
side
at
all
said
leon
to
himself
i
wouldn
t
be
afraid
to
bet
that
you
will
stay
around
here
and
lead
the
rebels
to
our
place
of
newman
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
pushed
his
hat
on
the
back
of
his
head
and
looked
after
leon
as
he
walked
away
with
the
rebel
by
his
side
i
ll
bet
that
boy
lied
to
me
when
he
spoke
of
that
fellow
being
after
him
with
a
sword
said
he
and
that
he
ever
run
from
him
a
step
i
am
no
good
for
a
spy
i
haven
t
got
my
wits
about
me
but
his
father
will
give
me
one
of
those
mules
or
i
ll
know
the
reason
why
it
is
most
time
for
the
rebels
to
come
up
here
and
when
they
do
come
my
fine
lad
i
ll
have
that
horse
of
who
is
that
fellow
anyway
asked
dawson
after
they
had
left
newman
behind
you
don
t
seem
to
like
him
very
neither
would
you
if
you
knew
him
as
well
as
i
do
replied
leon
ever
since
i
got
into
a
scrape
with
those
logs
that
fellow
has
been
down
on
me
and
said
he
didn
t
see
why
i
should
come
out
all
right
when
other
men
had
lost
their
lives
in
attempting
the
same
you
don
t
bear
him
any
for
that
i
hope
said
dawson
he
didn
t
dare
do
it
although
i
don
t
know
what
danger
you
got
i
ran
out
on
the
logs
and
started
a
jam
and
tom
howe
fell
into
the
water
and
i
saved
him
but
that
isn
t
what
i
have
against
him
said
leon
you
see
newman
s
father
has
never
said
where
he
stood
when
he
came
back
to
this
county
and
found
that
we
were
in
earnest
in
threatening
to
secede
then
he
wanted
an
office
but
the
men
were
too
sharp
to
give
it
to
ah
that
s
the
trouble
is
it
let
him
go
in
and
serve
as
a
private
that
s
what
my
father
and
i
intend
to
but
he
don
t
want
to
serve
as
a
private
he
wants
the
position
that
father
holds
so
that
he
can
boss
around
the
men
and
have
nothing
else
to
do
father
would
give
it
to
him
in
a
minute
if
he
thought
he
was
able
to
fill
it
but
you
see
he
don
t
and
mind
you
i
don
t
say
this
out
loud
but
i
believe
it
to
be
so
he
says
if
he
can
t
be
an
officer
he
will
betray
us
said
dawson
while
a
gleam
of
intelligence
shot
across
his
face
he
is
going
to
turn
benedict
arnold
is
he
by
gracious
you
fellows
have
something
to
contend
with
haven
t
you
a
spy
well
let
him
come
on
and
see
how
much
he
will
make
by
now
don
t
say
that
out
loud
said
leon
earnestly
for
i
don
t
know
that
it
is
so
i
only
judge
him
by
his
actions
now
here
s
the
place
where
your
weapons
were
left
we
ll
go
up
and
see
the
i
don
t
look
fit
to
go
into
the
president
s
office
said
dawson
looking
down
at
his
clothes
i
want
to
get
home
and
see
my
wardrobe
so
that
i
can
get
some
clothes
more
befitting
my
station
in
o
come
on
said
leon
with
a
hearty
laugh
ten
to
one
you
will
find
the
president
with
a
pair
of
jean
breeches
on
and
a
pair
of
cowhide
boots
he
is
like
all
the
rest
of
us
but
then
he
will
be
glad
to
see
you
for
you
were
a
rebel
there
s
where
you
make
a
mistake
said
dawson
i
never
was
a
rebel
although
i
wear
the
clothes
introduce
me
as
a
union
man
forced
into
the
rebel
at
this
moment
leon
opened
the
door
that
gave
entrance
into
the
office
of
the
high
dignitary
of
jones
county
where
they
found
him
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
conversing
with
three
or
four
men
he
was
just
such
a
man
as
leon
said
he
the
manor
born
he
didn
t
act
as
though
he
considered
himself
better
than
other
men
simply
because
he
was
president
dawson
took
off
his
hat
while
the
other
men
did
not
remove
theirs
he
followed
leon
to
a
corner
in
which
several
stand
of
were
stowed
and
assisted
him
in
picking
out
his
own
weapons
leon
gave
him
the
sword
and
revolver
and
motioned
him
to
buckle
them
around
him
while
with
the
carbine
in
his
hand
he
approached
the
president
s
chair
when
he
got
through
talking
with
the
men
he
looked
up
to
see
what
leon
had
to
say
mr
knight
here
s
a
good
man
i
have
got
for
us
said
he
his
name
is
dawson
and
although
he
wears
the
rebel
uniform
he
is
as
much
of
a
union
man
as
anyone
howdy
dawson
said
the
president
nodding
his
head
so
you
are
coming
over
to
side
with
us
are
you
yes
sir
said
dawson
i
was
obliged
to
go
into
the
rebel
ranks
to
escape
being
he
wants
his
horse
and
his
weapons
too
added
leon
father
says
he
is
all
let
him
have
them
said
the
president
leon
promptly
handed
over
the
carbine
he
wants
to
go
home
to
get
his
mother
said
he
there
are
two
of
us
myself
and
tom
howe
going
with
i
heard
all
about
it
from
your
father
said
knight
now
be
careful
of
yourself
leon
if
you
should
get
captured
it
would
drive
the
first
colonel
i
have
got
the
boy
promised
that
he
would
look
out
for
himself
and
with
a
salute
from
dawson
they
opened
the
door
and
went
down
the
stairs
they
saw
that
sprague
had
already
hitched
the
mules
to
the
wagons
and
hauled
them
down
in
front
of
the
hotel
where
they
could
be
examined
by
all
the
principal
men
of
the
county
before
they
had
taken
many
steps
they
saw
newman
walk
up
to
the
secretary
of
war
and
accost
him
chapter
viii
rebels
in
the
rear
what
did
i
tell
you
said
leon
turning
to
his
companion
newman
is
going
to
strike
father
for
one
of
those
mules
let
us
go
up
and
see
how
he
comes
i
don
t
think
i
ought
to
give
you
a
mule
newman
said
sprague
as
leon
and
dawson
approached
within
hearing
distance
you
were
not
with
us
at
all
newman
glanced
at
leon
and
saw
there
was
one
lie
nailed
but
he
had
become
so
accustomed
to
being
caught
that
way
that
he
hardly
changed
color
he
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
looked
up
the
road
toward
the
and
said
well
you
see
one
of
our
cows
had
strayed
away
and
i
was
afraid
she
might
not
come
up
so
i
went
into
the
woods
to
find
and
you
thought
that
cow
was
of
more
use
to
the
county
than
stopping
the
train
did
you
it
was
of
more
use
to
us
cause
you
see
we
wouldn
t
have
had
any
milk
to
put
in
our
and
you
have
milk
in
your
coffee
every
day
do
you
that
s
more
than
i
have
and
i
have
eight
or
nine
cows
on
my
well
can
i
have
the
mule
that
s
what
i
want
to
no
i
don
t
think
you
you
have
given
one
to
tom
howe
and
never
asked
him
what
he
was
going
to
do
with
it
said
newman
hotly
but
i
knew
what
tom
was
going
to
do
with
his
mule
before
i
gave
it
to
him
whenever
we
get
ready
to
go
out
and
capture
a
train
tom
will
be
on
hand
and
that
s
more
than
i
can
say
in
regard
to
then
you
won
t
give
me
the
mule
no
i
can
t
you
will
have
to
go
to
somebody
else
and
get
one
it
is
government
property
that
comes
into
my
hands
and
i
am
bound
to
take
the
best
of
care
of
i
ll
get
even
with
you
for
this
some
way
or
another
said
newman
starting
to
walk
off
newman
said
sprague
sternly
come
back
well
now
when
i
come
back
you
just
blow
a
horn
to
let
me
know
it
will
you
replied
newman
still
continuing
on
his
way
if
i
ask
you
once
more
i
shall
put
you
under
arrest
said
sprague
i
am
not
in
the
habit
of
giving
orders
while
he
was
speaking
there
were
certain
other
parties
who
had
arrived
with
a
wagon
who
happened
to
overhear
the
conversation
that
passed
between
sprague
and
newman
they
dropped
whatever
they
were
about
and
came
up
to
see
about
it
for
one
of
the
disputants
had
got
so
angry
that
he
raised
his
voice
a
good
deal
above
its
natural
key
one
of
them
was
bud
mccoy
the
man
who
had
threatened
to
burn
swayne
s
house
before
he
got
out
of
it
he
did
not
like
newman
any
too
well
for
he
believed
that
the
young
man
was
more
in
favor
of
secessionists
than
he
was
of
the
union
men
come
back
here
you
scoundrel
said
bud
shaking
his
fists
in
the
other
s
face
oh
now
bud
you
haven
t
anything
to
do
with
it
said
newman
and
he
retraced
his
steps
very
slowly
come
faster
than
that
said
bud
tucking
up
his
i
will
show
you
that
i
have
something
to
do
with
i
will
tell
my
father
what
you
are
doing
up
here
and
perhaps
he
will
think
we
had
better
go
back
to
mobile
said
newman
well
go
back
to
mobile
you
belong
there
among
the
rebels
more
n
you
do
among
these
union
men
your
father
has
not
got
anything
to
do
with
this
business
we
ve
been
talking
about
playing
soldier
for
a
long
time
and
now
that
we
have
got
a
constitution
we
are
going
to
act
you
ll
see
that
there
is
a
big
difference
between
the
one
moment
bud
said
sprague
when
he
saw
that
newman
had
been
frightened
sufficiently
to
put
a
little
sense
into
him
you
may
not
have
been
aware
of
the
fact
he
added
addressing
himself
to
newman
but
you
were
treating
me
in
a
way
that
i
don
t
like
when
you
refused
to
come
back
here
perhaps
i
have
more
authority
in
this
county
than
you
think
for
you
talked
about
getting
even
with
me
how
are
you
going
to
do
it
i
was
only
fooling
said
newman
i
didn
t
mean
nothing
by
well
hereafter
when
you
feel
aggrieved
by
an
officer
don
t
say
that
you
will
get
even
with
him
in
some
way
that
looks
to
me
as
though
you
had
something
on
your
i
haven
t
i
haven
t
honor
bright
said
newman
wondering
if
sprague
knew
anything
further
there
had
been
talk
between
his
father
and
some
of
the
rebel
officers
who
had
their
quarters
in
mobile
in
regard
to
betraying
all
the
chief
men
of
the
confederacy
into
their
hands
and
this
was
one
reason
that
brought
him
back
there
but
newman
didn
t
suppose
that
anybody
but
his
own
family
knew
anything
about
it
it
looks
mighty
suspicious
continued
sprague
but
i
can
t
give
you
that
mule
it
is
not
my
business
anyway
it
belongs
to
the
quartermaster
s
department
and
he
is
the
man
you
must
sprague
turned
on
his
heel
and
went
away
to
inspect
one
of
the
wagons
and
leon
and
dawson
continued
their
walk
toward
roberts
to
say
that
leon
was
surprised
to
hear
his
father
talk
in
this
way
would
not
express
his
feelings
i
tell
you
your
father
can
t
be
too
strict
when
it
comes
to
the
pinch
said
dawson
i
didn
t
know
he
had
so
much
in
him
well
you
see
he
is
high
in
authority
and
it
won
t
do
to
let
ordinary
men
talk
to
him
as
that
newman
did
say
that
fellow
knew
something
he
did
not
want
to
speak
that
s
my
idea
exactly
said
leon
i
ll
keep
watch
on
him
and
if
i
find
anything
out
of
the
way
with
him
i
ll
arrest
him
and
take
him
before
if
you
do
that
he
ll
shoot
my
gracious
has
it
come
to
that
exclaimed
leon
astonished
beyond
measure
of
course
it
has
i
have
seen
three
men
shot
to
death
because
they
tried
to
desert
the
army
and
you
have
got
to
come
down
to
that
way
of
doing
business
here
you
will
have
to
be
stricter
too
than
they
are
in
the
army
for
you
have
got
less
power
to
back
you
up
oh
you
re
not
going
to
have
a
picnic
i
ll
tell
you
leon
was
thunderstruck
for
he
did
not
believe
that
such
things
could
take
place
in
jones
county
while
he
was
thinking
about
it
they
came
up
with
roberts
who
had
borrowed
a
mule
to
take
the
place
of
the
one
that
had
dropped
dead
during
his
rapid
flight
and
was
engaged
in
packing
things
into
his
wagon
he
said
he
was
going
deeper
into
the
swamp
you
see
these
houses
are
right
on
the
main
road
and
the
rebels
who
come
in
will
come
from
perry
county
said
he
i
don
t
propose
to
have
what
things
i
own
burned
up
and
so
i
am
going
to
take
them
where
it
will
cost
the
confederates
some
trouble
to
get
at
well
say
roberts
what
do
you
suppose
they
would
do
to
you
if
they
should
succeed
in
getting
their
hands
on
you
asked
leon
i
deserted
to
the
enemy
didn
t
i
asked
roberts
yes
you
and
i
had
my
rebel
clothes
on
when
i
left
their
camp
leon
nodded
and
roberts
after
looking
at
him
a
moment
made
a
turn
of
a
rope
around
his
neck
drew
it
up
with
his
left
hand
and
allowed
his
head
to
fall
over
on
one
side
that
s
what
they
would
do
with
me
said
roberts
with
a
laugh
i
don
t
suppose
they
would
shoot
me
but
they
must
catch
me
first
i
m
not
going
to
be
taken
prisoner
and
dawson
there
would
come
in
for
something
of
the
dawson
smiled
and
said
he
well
knew
what
was
coming
if
he
allowed
himself
to
be
taken
prisoner
and
thrust
out
his
hand
adding
well
i
don
t
suppose
i
shall
see
you
again
until
we
get
into
our
first
fight
i
am
going
after
my
mother
old
boy
and
remember
and
don
t
let
those
graybacks
get
a
grip
on
i
ll
stay
right
there
on
the
field
until
i
drop
said
dawson
earnestly
you
ll
never
hear
of
my
being
they
turned
off
to
find
their
horses
after
which
they
drew
a
for
tom
s
camp
leon
didn
t
have
much
to
say
when
men
like
dawson
and
roberts
could
talk
as
they
did
about
falling
into
the
hands
of
their
old
comrades
it
made
him
feel
kind
of
anxious
and
if
they
would
serve
the
deserters
that
way
what
would
they
do
with
him
he
was
a
traitor
to
the
cause
of
southern
independence
everybody
on
the
pascagoula
river
from
the
swamps
down
knew
who
he
was
and
if
he
should
unfortunately
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
confederates
a
captive
they
would
without
a
doubt
hang
him
without
giving
him
any
trial
at
all
he
had
never
been
able
to
look
at
it
in
this
light
before
and
it
made
him
feel
rather
desperate
but
here
was
a
fellow
who
would
take
ample
revenge
for
his
death
if
such
a
thing
should
happen
it
was
tom
howe
who
when
they
found
him
was
sitting
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
and
he
had
just
been
disposing
of
a
substantial
breakfast
which
somebody
had
provided
for
him
halloo
leon
and
you
dawson
halloo
said
tom
getting
upon
his
feet
well
if
you
are
going
home
now
i
am
going
with
you
i
have
been
around
that
muel
forty
times
as
that
man
told
me
to
petting
her
and
fooling
in
various
ways
and
she
never
offered
to
kick
me
but
what
s
the
matter
with
you
leon
you
act
as
though
your
last
friends
had
been
gobbled
up
by
the
well
they
haven
t
been
gobbled
up
yet
but
i
am
just
thinking
of
what
would
happen
to
them
if
they
were
gobbled
said
leon
do
you
know
what
they
would
do
with
you
if
they
caught
you
hang
me
i
suppose
but
you
see
leon
these
swamps
are
mighty
but
you
are
going
right
among
them
oh
no
said
dawson
quickly
we
ll
not
see
a
rebel
from
the
time
we
leave
here
until
we
get
back
i
m
not
going
to
get
you
in
any
fuss
if
i
thought
there
was
a
chance
i
wouldn
t
go
but
we
are
liable
to
be
mistaken
you
i
ll
tell
you
what
i
ll
do
said
dawson
i
ll
ride
on
ahead
and
the
first
glimpse
i
see
of
anything
suspicious
i
ll
warn
you
you
certainly
will
not
be
captured
in
that
tom
struck
up
a
whistle
as
if
to
show
how
much
he
cared
what
the
rebels
might
think
it
worth
while
to
do
and
went
to
work
about
the
mule
as
though
he
had
always
owned
her
strapped
a
piece
of
to
serve
in
lieu
of
a
saddle
felt
his
revolvers
to
make
sure
that
they
were
safe
and
then
announced
that
he
was
ready
their
ride
would
have
been
gloomy
enough
for
they
did
not
meet
a
single
person
on
the
way
had
it
not
been
for
dawson
who
was
fairly
alive
with
stories
he
was
two
or
three
years
older
than
leon
but
like
all
boys
who
had
lived
much
he
was
almost
big
enough
to
be
considered
a
man
he
was
young
enough
in
his
boyish
tastes
and
habits
to
be
with
leon
and
tom
and
reckless
enough
to
add
a
spice
of
danger
to
everything
he
engaged
in
they
did
not
think
they
had
been
on
their
way
a
great
while
before
the
was
in
view
leon
did
not
see
anybody
about
the
doors
of
the
negro
quarters
were
closed
and
so
were
the
rear
doors
of
the
house
and
even
the
pickaninnies
who
were
usually
the
first
to
welcome
him
when
he
rode
up
to
the
bars
were
nowhere
in
sight
i
wonder
what
s
been
going
on
here
said
leon
involuntarily
sinking
his
voice
to
a
whisper
there
are
more
people
than
this
in
the
i
should
say
there
ought
to
be
said
tom
we
haven
t
seen
any
if
it
was
a
little
nearer
the
lower
end
of
the
county
i
should
say
that
some
rebels
had
been
calling
here
said
dawson
in
an
anxious
tone
of
voice
i
have
seen
many
a
house
look
that
filled
with
forebodings
leon
hurried
on
until
he
came
opposite
the
front
bars
and
on
the
way
he
saw
a
man
lying
down
behind
a
log
with
a
rifle
in
his
hand
and
it
was
pointed
toward
the
other
bank
of
the
stream
which
here
ran
through
sprague
s
property
the
moment
the
topmost
bars
rattled
the
front
door
opened
and
his
mother
came
out
on
the
porch
thank
goodness
she
was
safe
why
mother
what
s
up
cried
leon
throwing
himself
off
his
horse
and
rushing
up
the
steps
with
arms
spread
out
when
i
saw
the
house
closed
i
supposed
something
had
something
has
happened
replied
his
mother
and
although
her
face
was
very
pale
her
lips
and
the
way
in
which
her
hands
trembled
showed
that
she
was
trying
to
keep
down
some
rising
emotion
the
rebels
are
at
it
at
what
asked
leon
while
the
other
boys
got
up
close
to
her
to
hear
what
she
had
to
say
there
have
been
two
men
over
on
the
other
side
of
the
creek
and
they
have
got
a
complete
map
made
out
of
all
the
streams
and
the
places
where
they
are
fordable
said
his
mother
why
how
did
you
find
it
out
asked
leon
one
of
the
darkies
discovered
them
and
i
slipped
out
very
quietly
and
told
giddings
of
wasn
t
it
lucky
that
i
brought
giddings
here
i
knew
i
was
proposing
a
good
thing
when
i
advised
him
to
come
well
what
did
giddings
do
he
took
down
his
rifle
and
shot
one
of
the
men
said
sprague
at
the
same
time
clinging
to
leon
as
if
she
were
afraid
that
the
ghost
of
the
slain
man
might
come
back
this
war
is
going
to
be
a
horrible
thing
i
wouldn
t
see
the
thing
happen
again
for
all
the
money
the
united
states
is
worth
it
was
the
first
thing
of
the
kind
i
ever
saw
why
did
you
stay
here
and
look
at
it
asked
leon
how
did
he
know
that
he
had
a
map
what
made
him
shoot
him
in
the
first
place
well
he
was
acting
very
sly
making
use
of
every
tree
and
stump
to
cover
him
so
giddings
thought
he
would
shoot
them
both
he
went
over
there
in
our
boat
and
got
the
man
and
he
is
out
there
now
in
one
of
our
negro
cabins
and
he
hadn
t
any
more
than
brought
him
over
here
before
the
other
fellow
shot
at
he
didn
t
hit
him
i
suppose
no
but
he
made
the
bullet
sing
pretty
close
to
his
i
reckon
that
giddings
had
better
stay
here
and
protect
you
said
leon
after
thinking
a
moment
i
am
not
coming
home
and
neither
is
father
we
had
some
work
day
before
yesterday
he
added
as
if
trying
to
draw
her
away
from
the
melancholy
event
she
had
witnessed
we
captured
forty
wagons
without
firing
a
shot
here
s
a
man
who
was
with
them
mother
let
me
introduce
dawson
he
is
going
back
into
the
country
for
his
mother
and
wants
tom
and
me
to
go
with
sprague
smiled
for
the
first
time
shook
dawson
by
the
hand
said
she
was
glad
to
see
him
on
the
union
side
if
he
did
wear
those
clothes
on
his
back
and
then
she
turned
to
tom
howe
who
had
just
come
in
from
hitching
the
horses
as
those
rebels
didn
t
fire
a
shot
at
you
the
other
day
you
don
t
know
how
it
feels
said
sprague
who
me
no
ma
am
i
just
covered
a
driver
s
head
with
my
rifle
and
told
him
to
hold
up
his
hands
and
he
put
them
into
his
pockets
and
brought
out
his
revolvers
which
he
handed
to
me
there
they
are
said
tom
putting
his
hands
behind
him
and
bringing
out
a
pistol
in
each
you
see
leon
had
a
revolver
and
i
had
none
and
i
just
put
these
into
my
clothes
and
said
nothing
about
it
if
i
am
going
to
be
a
soldier
i
ll
soon
learn
how
to
steal
as
well
as
let
s
go
out
there
and
see
what
giddings
is
doing
said
leon
mother
can
you
get
us
up
some
dinner
we
have
a
long
way
to
ride
and
we
want
to
give
our
horses
a
little
rest
after
we
get
back
to
his
mother
said
that
dinner
would
be
ready
by
the
time
he
wanted
it
and
leon
walked
around
the
house
toward
the
place
he
had
seen
giddings
lying
in
ambush
followed
by
his
companions
giddings
was
on
his
feet
now
and
was
standing
behind
a
looking
cautiously
around
the
corner
of
it
howdy
leon
he
exclaimed
when
he
saw
the
boys
approaching
you
had
better
get
something
between
you
and
the
woods
over
there
for
that
chap
is
a
tolerable
fair
shot
i
don
t
like
the
way
he
sent
his
bullet
past
my
he
didn
t
hit
you
though
said
leon
as
the
boys
drew
up
beside
the
mountaineer
from
tennessee
they
kept
an
eye
on
the
woods
but
all
danger
from
that
source
had
passed
the
rebel
who
had
been
left
alive
had
taken
advantage
of
the
bushes
crawled
among
them
until
he
was
out
of
sight
and
so
got
himself
safe
off
and
the
only
reason
he
didn
t
make
a
better
shot
was
because
he
had
a
revolver
said
giddings
i
tell
you
leon
we
are
going
to
have
trouble
now
those
fellows
are
making
a
map
of
this
whole
perhaps
they
are
looking
too
for
that
we
stole
from
them
said
leon
there
were
forty
wagons
in
the
lot
and
we
captured
the
last
one
of
sho
exclaimed
giddings
in
disgust
and
i
wasn
t
there
to
help
but
let
s
go
in
and
look
at
that
man
perhaps
you
know
who
he
the
boys
followed
the
man
into
the
negro
cabin
with
slight
quakings
of
conscience
all
except
dawson
who
had
seen
so
many
dead
men
that
he
thought
nothing
of
it
he
lay
there
on
the
floor
covered
with
a
blanket
never
to
move
again
in
this
life
with
bushy
black
whiskers
spread
all
down
his
breast
and
dressed
in
a
uniform
that
had
a
couple
of
bars
on
the
collar
he
was
a
man
and
leon
was
wondering
how
many
hearts
would
break
when
they
heard
of
his
death
i
hit
him
right
in
the
heart
said
giddings
pointing
out
the
mark
of
his
bullet
on
his
coat
with
as
much
indifference
as
he
would
have
shown
if
it
had
been
a
deer
instead
of
a
man
that
was
stretched
out
before
him
know
him
any
of
you
no
he
is
a
stranger
to
me
i
think
the
best
thing
you
can
do
giddings
said
leon
reverently
spreading
the
blanket
over
the
dead
man
s
face
again
is
to
stay
here
and
keep
an
eye
on
mother
i
didn
t
think
the
rebels
would
ever
trouble
her
up
did
you
steal
much
of
them
asked
giddings
leon
replied
that
to
the
best
of
his
knowledge
it
was
pretty
near
half
a
million
dollars
worth
a
half
a
million
pshaw
they
will
be
all
over
this
county
looking
for
them
goods
and
you
will
have
to
go
deeper
into
the
swamp
to
be
rid
of
them
when
the
rebels
come
they
won
t
leave
a
shingle
of
this
house
that
you
can
use
they
will
burn
them
where
s
the
map
he
made
out
your
mother
has
got
that
and
his
weapons
too
yes
i
guess
the
best
thing
i
can
do
is
to
stay
here
there
may
be
some
more
of
these
confederates
where
these
came
leon
went
out
spent
a
few
moments
in
exchanging
compliments
with
giddings
wife
who
was
very
comfortably
settled
in
her
new
quarters
and
went
into
the
house
to
ask
his
mother
for
the
map
the
rebel
had
made
while
the
dinner
was
being
made
ready
the
boys
spent
their
time
in
looking
it
over
they
were
astonished
to
find
all
the
streams
as
far
up
as
he
had
time
to
go
were
correctly
drawn
and
still
more
amazed
to
see
that
the
little
creek
which
marked
the
between
their
county
and
perry
which
was
so
deep
at
the
place
where
the
bridge
extended
across
it
could
be
forded
in
five
different
localities
that
man
must
have
been
a
civil
engineer
said
dawson
no
one
without
he
had
some
knowledge
of
the
business
could
go
over
those
streams
in
the
short
time
he
has
and
make
such
a
complete
map
of
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
the
boys
had
eaten
their
dinner
and
were
well
on
their
way
toward
ellisville
leon
having
the
map
for
which
the
man
in
the
rebel
army
had
given
his
life
safely
stowed
away
in
one
of
his
pockets
he
wasn
t
as
happy
now
as
he
was
when
he
came
that
way
before
dawson
s
stories
of
his
adventures
had
made
him
a
little
reckless
and
he
felt
as
though
he
would
like
to
go
through
some
of
them
himself
but
unfortunately
it
did
not
come
to
him
in
quite
that
way
here
was
his
mother
liable
to
see
more
adventures
than
he
was
and
how
did
he
know
but
a
squad
of
rebel
cavalry
would
come
down
on
her
kill
her
guard
and
carry
her
off
to
some
southern
another
thing
the
union
men
had
been
very
careful
to
hold
a
force
on
the
main
road
which
extended
into
perry
county
so
as
to
meet
the
confederate
troops
when
they
came
there
and
now
the
rebels
had
been
at
work
operating
in
their
rear
it
told
leon
that
they
had
got
something
to
do
before
they
could
establish
their
independence
i
know
what
you
are
thinking
of
leon
said
dawson
i
don
t
care
how
strongly
a
place
is
fortified
or
how
closely
it
is
watched
the
enemy
will
get
in
and
make
a
map
of
it
they
know
right
where
the
strongest
works
are
and
all
about
what
do
they
do
with
a
man
they
catch
making
those
maps
that
depends
if
he
is
in
citizens
clothes
they
take
him
and
shut
him
up
but
if
he
is
in
uniform
then
it
s
do
they
shoot
him
no
they
hang
him
just
as
surely
as
they
can
get
their
hands
upon
him
so
you
see
that
that
rebel
up
to
your
house
got
what
he
deserved
he
knew
what
was
going
to
happen
to
him
in
case
he
was
caught
and
he
would
rather
be
shot
than
before
the
boys
had
gone
a
great
way
on
their
road
to
ellisville
they
met
a
party
of
perhaps
a
hundred
men
some
with
an
axe
on
one
shoulder
and
a
rifle
on
the
other
accompanied
by
three
or
four
wagons
loaded
with
their
household
furniture
they
were
going
up
into
the
swamp
to
build
boats
so
that
their
families
would
not
be
cut
off
when
the
time
came
for
them
to
retreat
the
president
sent
us
but
i
don
t
look
for
much
trouble
up
here
said
the
leader
of
the
party
leaning
on
his
rifle
but
then
it
is
well
to
be
on
the
safe
don
t
fool
yourselves
said
leon
the
rebels
won
t
come
along
the
main
sho
how
do
you
know
because
they
have
got
men
around
in
your
rear
working
at
maps
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
said
leon
here
s
a
map
that
was
taken
off
a
dead
rebel
this
as
leon
produced
the
book
the
men
crowded
around
in
eagerness
to
see
it
they
looked
at
it
in
surprise
but
they
little
thought
it
was
a
plan
that
would
lead
the
attacking
force
miles
behind
them
and
that
when
they
turned
they
would
find
five
hundred
men
in
front
of
them
and
that
they
could
drive
them
across
the
little
stream
before
spoken
of
and
into
the
hands
of
another
confederate
party
who
were
concealed
there
in
the
bushes
waiting
for
them
it
was
a
scheme
to
clean
out
the
union
party
at
one
fell
swoop
and
nothing
but
leon
s
going
home
that
morning
saved
them
from
it
there
s
the
little
creek
right
there
which
divides
our
county
from
perry
said
leon
pointing
it
out
with
his
and
that
map
shows
that
it
is
fordable
in
five
different
and
below
the
well
sir
it
s
amazing
how
he
got
all
the
little
streams
down
there
in
the
little
time
that
he
has
had
said
the
leader
who
shot
this
rebel
mr
giddings
he
is
lying
in
one
of
father
s
negro
cabins
i
tell
you
this
that
you
need
not
be
caught
napping
said
leon
putting
the
book
where
it
belonged
there
may
be
more
rebels
where
these
came
from
and
you
don
t
want
to
let
them
see
what
you
are
doing
and
good
luck
to
ellisville
was
livelier
now
than
they
had
ever
seen
it
except
on
the
day
of
the
convention
there
were
men
scattered
all
over
it
but
the
greatest
number
of
them
were
around
the
hotel
all
the
chief
men
were
there
inspecting
the
wagons
to
see
what
there
was
in
them
and
as
fast
as
one
wagon
was
found
to
contain
provisions
it
was
pushed
off
on
one
side
to
be
hitched
up
directly
and
taken
away
into
the
swamp
it
seemed
strange
that
when
one
of
them
had
been
doing
such
good
work
and
when
all
the
men
about
him
were
so
deeply
interested
in
what
was
going
on
before
them
that
there
was
one
among
them
who
ached
for
an
opportunity
to
throw
it
all
into
the
it
was
newman
he
was
waiting
to
see
the
quartermaster
he
was
going
to
get
a
mule
if
he
could
if
not
he
was
going
to
bust
up
the
whole
chapter
ix
a
night
expedition
who
do
you
report
to
asked
dawson
as
following
leon
s
example
he
pulled
his
horse
up
to
a
halt
what
do
i
want
to
report
to
anybody
for
asked
leon
these
things
were
entirely
new
to
him
and
he
had
a
good
many
formalities
to
learn
why
it
is
the
rule
that
you
must
report
to
the
men
who
sent
you
away
in
order
that
they
may
know
when
you
got
oh
then
i
suppose
i
ought
to
report
to
father
he
is
busy
now
but
as
soon
as
i
can
get
his
ear
i
ll
tell
him
about
this
map
now
tom
you
and
dawson
go
back
to
your
camp
and
stay
there
till
i
come
we
ll
make
that
our
headquarters
until
we
get
ready
to
go
but
sprague
was
not
so
very
busy
that
he
could
not
take
a
little
time
to
listen
to
leon
the
last
two
wagons
were
loaded
with
clothing
and
he
told
the
person
who
officiated
as
quartermaster
that
it
would
be
proper
for
him
to
call
up
any
of
the
men
who
needed
something
to
wear
adding
there
are
rebel
uniforms
in
there
and
i
expect
the
men
won
t
want
to
wear
them
but
it
can
t
be
helped
i
know
i
shouldn
t
want
to
take
off
my
clothes
and
put
on
a
gray
jacket
well
leon
how
did
you
find
your
mother
no
confederates
been
near
her
i
suppose
sprague
opened
his
eyes
in
surprise
when
he
received
a
warning
gesture
from
leon
but
he
followed
him
off
on
one
side
out
of
reach
of
everybody
the
boy
then
began
a
hurried
account
of
what
had
transpired
at
his
house
showed
him
the
map
and
told
how
he
had
left
giddings
there
to
keep
an
eye
on
his
mother
to
his
surprise
his
father
never
changed
his
countenance
at
all
he
listened
to
leon
s
recital
with
the
same
apparent
unconcern
that
he
would
have
received
any
ordinary
piece
of
news
now
father
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
this
said
leon
in
conclusion
it
looks
to
me
as
though
the
rebels
were
getting
up
something
and
the
first
thing
we
know
they
will
be
after
i
don
t
know
what
i
shall
do
about
it
yet
said
sprague
i
shall
want
to
see
knight
about
it
first
now
as
you
are
going
into
foreign
parts
why
i
am
not
going
away
exclaimed
leon
i
am
only
going
into
perry
well
that
is
a
foreign
country
that
is
what
the
rebels
call
the
united
states
and
head
all
their
news
as
foreign
what
s
the
reason
that
we
can
t
so
designate
a
county
which
they
claim
you
are
going
into
perry
county
to
help
dawson
bring
his
mother
up
here
and
i
must
instruct
you
how
to
pass
the
have
you
got
some
sentries
out
inquired
leon
we
ve
got
ten
men
down
by
that
bridge
but
this
map
you
have
shown
me
proves
that
they
won
t
do
much
good
there
now
when
you
come
up
with
sprague
took
this
as
his
and
went
on
to
tell
leon
just
what
he
must
do
when
he
passed
the
sentries
it
was
new
business
to
him
and
he
must
be
very
careful
how
he
acted
he
must
not
attempt
to
run
by
sprague
thought
that
dawson
was
rather
careless
and
was
afraid
he
might
do
something
to
draw
the
sentries
must
do
just
as
he
was
told
when
ordered
to
dismount
and
bring
the
countersign
fidelity
he
remember
it
must
be
sure
not
to
give
it
until
the
sentry
was
close
upon
him
and
then
utter
it
in
tones
so
low
that
no
one
but
the
man
for
whom
it
was
intended
could
hear
it
leon
promised
compliance
repeated
the
countersign
over
to
be
sure
he
had
it
in
his
mind
then
shook
his
father
warmly
by
the
hand
and
went
off
to
tom
howe
s
camp
in
reply
to
their
inquiring
glances
leon
then
went
on
to
tell
that
his
father
had
decided
to
see
knight
before
he
determined
what
to
do
in
regard
to
the
men
who
had
been
operating
in
the
rear
and
described
how
he
was
going
to
work
it
to
get
by
the
sentries
that
s
all
right
said
dawson
we
can
t
attempt
anything
wrong
there
although
to
tell
the
truth
i
have
run
by
my
own
sentries
more
than
what
would
they
do
with
you
if
they
were
to
catch
you
in
that
business
inquired
tom
oh
if
you
hadn
t
made
any
effort
at
deserting
they
would
put
you
in
the
replied
dawson
with
a
laugh
they
would
think
it
was
merely
a
little
fun
on
your
part
and
they
wouldn
t
punish
you
very
severely
but
if
you
were
known
to
be
a
deserter
they
would
hang
you
in
a
minute
now
i
suppose
we
can
wait
here
until
it
is
pretty
near
dark
and
then
we
must
be
up
and
doing
if
you
fellows
don
t
want
to
go
say
the
word
and
i
ll
go
i
shall
be
with
you
when
you
see
your
mother
said
leon
here
too
said
tom
you
just
bet
i
ll
stick
close
to
leon
s
if
he
gets
into
a
row
i
ll
be
there
to
after
that
there
was
silence
in
the
camp
for
two
of
the
boys
had
something
at
least
to
think
about
they
were
about
to
begin
soldiering
in
earnest
it
is
true
that
the
events
of
the
day
before
had
infused
new
confidence
into
them
but
the
attacking
union
party
was
a
great
deal
stronger
than
the
confederate
escort
and
a
battle
if
one
had
taken
place
could
have
ended
in
but
one
way
now
they
were
going
right
in
among
those
fellows
and
who
knew
but
they
might
run
onto
a
squad
of
rebels
who
were
numerically
their
superiors
and
be
all
taken
prisoners
that
was
what
bothered
leon
he
wasn
t
afraid
of
being
shot
but
he
was
afraid
of
being
hanged
there
was
something
murderous
about
a
rope
and
the
men
getting
ready
to
haul
away
on
it
but
with
a
bullet
the
case
was
different
well
if
i
am
going
to
die
i
ll
show
myself
a
man
soliloquized
leon
as
he
rolled
about
under
the
trees
watching
tom
who
was
getting
an
early
supper
for
them
how
cool
dawson
takes
his
rebel
friend
lay
opposite
to
him
on
the
other
side
of
the
fire
with
his
saddle
for
a
pillow
and
his
hat
drawn
over
his
face
and
the
regular
breathing
that
came
to
leon
s
ears
told
him
he
was
fast
asleep
now
it
seems
to
me
that
if
i
was
going
back
among
a
lot
of
comrades
who
were
just
aching
to
hang
me
i
should
find
something
to
think
about
to
keep
me
awake
muttered
leon
maybe
it
is
all
in
a
lifetime
perhaps
when
i
have
been
through
as
many
dangers
as
he
has
i
can
go
to
sleep
supper
was
ready
at
last
dawson
aroused
to
eat
his
share
of
it
and
the
moment
he
was
settled
with
a
plate
of
bacon
and
before
him
he
became
at
once
full
of
stories
he
seemed
surprised
because
leon
told
him
that
he
was
asleep
well
i
couldn
t
make
the
time
pass
quicker
by
staying
awake
could
i
said
dawson
you
would
have
gone
to
sleep
if
you
knew
what
s
before
you
you
may
see
the
time
when
you
will
be
glad
to
take
a
wink
all
by
in
half
an
hour
more
the
boys
rode
out
of
the
grove
and
turned
their
horses
toward
the
bridge
in
passing
by
the
hotel
leon
saw
his
father
standing
on
the
porch
he
saluted
him
but
kept
right
on
without
stopping
dawson
was
surprised
and
remarked
in
his
quiet
way
that
sprague
was
taking
the
separation
very
coolly
he
must
have
unbounded
confidence
in
you
said
he
most
fathers
would
have
come
out
to
bid
you
i
did
that
long
ago
said
leon
my
mother
is
the
only
one
i
am
worrying
about
now
if
the
killing
of
that
rebel
will
convince
them
that
we
have
a
out
on
all
sides
i
shall
be
more
than
pleased
they
will
come
with
a
bigger
force
than
two
men
to
take
a
map
next
the
ride
through
the
woods
was
a
lonely
one
and
finally
just
as
it
began
to
grow
dark
they
came
within
sight
of
the
bridge
and
saw
a
sentry
pacing
up
and
down
there
with
his
piece
carried
at
shoulder
arms
one
thing
was
evident
to
leon
his
father
had
improved
his
time
in
giving
the
men
some
instruction
or
else
the
squad
was
under
a
corporal
who
understood
his
business
the
sentry
halted
when
he
heard
the
sound
of
their
horses
hoofs
on
the
road
faced
about
and
brought
his
gun
to
arms
port
before
he
said
a
word
that
fellow
acts
like
an
old
sentinel
don
t
he
said
dawson
he
has
been
in
the
service
no
i
reckon
not
said
leon
so
far
as
i
know
everyone
of
these
men
is
as
green
as
i
am
halt
shouted
the
sentry
who
comes
there
friends
with
the
countersign
said
leon
dismount
friends
advance
one
with
the
so
far
everything
was
all
right
but
the
next
move
was
something
that
was
not
down
in
the
tactics
no
sooner
had
leon
s
voice
answered
the
sentry
than
nine
men
came
running
from
different
parts
of
the
woods
and
took
up
their
stand
directly
behind
the
sentry
they
held
their
guns
in
readiness
too
as
if
they
meant
to
be
on
hand
for
anything
that
might
happen
i
tell
you
they
meant
to
be
ready
for
us
didn
t
they
said
dawson
you
won
t
get
the
sentries
in
our
army
to
answer
a
challenge
like
what
would
they
do
they
would
keep
out
of
sight
in
the
bushes
and
perhaps
be
ready
to
fire
in
case
anything
goes
the
boys
had
by
this
time
dismounted
and
leon
leaving
his
horse
for
dawson
to
hold
walked
up
to
the
sentry
and
whispered
the
countersign
fidelity
in
his
ears
the
countersign
is
correct
said
the
man
why
leon
where
are
you
going
don
t
you
know
that
you
will
be
gobbled
up
if
you
go
beyond
that
bend
no
said
leon
in
amazement
we
are
going
down
after
dawson
s
well
said
one
of
the
men
who
stood
behind
the
sentry
you
can
go
but
i
won
t
a
little
while
ago
two
or
three
of
us
happened
to
be
out
here
and
we
looked
up
and
saw
a
fellow
standing
in
the
road
watching
us
we
called
to
him
but
he
got
into
the
bushes
before
we
could
shoot
at
this
was
something
leon
had
not
bargained
for
the
other
boys
had
come
up
in
obedience
to
his
signal
and
they
all
heard
what
the
man
had
to
say
about
the
spy
who
was
watching
them
did
you
see
more
than
one
asked
dawson
who
was
utterly
amazed
to
know
the
rebels
had
come
between
him
and
his
mother
if
that
was
the
case
he
might
as
well
go
back
for
all
hope
of
bringing
her
into
the
union
camp
was
as
he
expressed
it
up
no
i
didn
t
see
but
one
and
he
was
a
johnny
for
the
way
he
took
to
the
bush
was
a
caution
said
the
man
that
was
what
brought
us
out
here
in
such
a
hurry
we
didn
t
know
but
there
might
be
others
behind
you
and
we
thought
we
would
be
ready
for
well
dawson
i
am
going
ahead
if
you
are
said
leon
talk
enough
exclaimed
dawson
placing
his
foot
in
the
stirrup
and
swinging
himself
upon
his
horse
all
i
want
is
a
little
pluck
to
back
me
up
and
i
will
have
my
mother
up
here
before
you
see
the
sun
you
have
got
the
old
man
s
grit
i
can
see
that
easy
enough
said
the
sentry
and
good
luck
to
you
we
don
t
want
to
say
a
word
to
dishearten
you
but
if
you
come
back
here
at
all
you
ll
come
one
sentry
can
t
stop
the
boys
laughed
but
anybody
could
see
that
it
was
forced
and
in
a
few
moments
they
were
around
the
bend
out
of
sight
it
was
there
that
the
rebel
spy
had
been
seen
they
looked
sharply
into
the
woods
as
they
passed
boy
had
his
revolver
drawn
and
hanging
by
his
the
thickets
were
as
silent
as
if
nobody
had
ever
been
there
leon
and
tom
were
very
pale
there
was
no
mistake
about
that
but
they
kept
as
close
at
the
heels
of
dawson
s
horse
as
they
could
possibly
get
not
a
word
was
said
until
the
woods
had
been
passed
and
they
found
themselves
in
the
midst
of
a
long
which
stretched
away
on
both
sides
of
them
and
in
the
distance
was
a
row
of
buildings
which
dawson
pointed
out
to
them
if
we
can
get
there
inside
of
that
house
we
are
all
right
said
he
and
a
person
wouldn
t
have
thought
from
the
way
he
spoke
that
he
was
thinking
of
his
mother
there
is
where
she
if
that
spy
was
in
the
bushes
and
saw
us
when
we
went
by
what
was
the
reason
he
didn
t
jump
out
and
grab
us
said
tom
perhaps
he
was
alone
said
leon
who
would
have
felt
safer
if
that
spy
whoever
he
was
had
been
among
his
friends
he
wants
more
help
before
he
attempts
to
arrest
now
boys
let
s
keep
perfectly
still
and
ride
up
to
the
house
as
though
we
had
a
right
there
said
dawson
you
are
not
afraid
to
shoot
are
you
tom
all
i
ask
of
you
is
to
give
me
a
chance
returned
tom
indignantly
anything
to
keep
from
being
made
the
boys
relapsed
into
silence
again
and
presently
drew
up
before
the
gate
which
gave
entrance
into
the
it
was
an
gate
and
was
held
in
place
by
a
wooden
pin
which
was
thrust
into
an
the
horse
dawson
rode
showed
that
he
was
accustomed
to
that
way
of
getting
in
for
he
moved
up
close
to
the
pin
so
that
his
rider
could
pull
it
the
gate
creaked
loudly
on
its
wooden
hinges
whereupon
they
heard
a
little
confusion
in
the
house
the
door
opened
and
by
the
aid
of
the
light
from
the
fireplace
the
boys
saw
a
woman
and
two
little
children
fill
the
door
oh
one
of
the
children
was
on
the
point
of
shouting
out
dawson
s
name
but
quicker
than
a
flash
the
mother
s
hand
covered
his
mouth
it
was
no
place
to
speak
a
person
s
name
out
loud
not
a
word
out
of
you
said
dawson
dismounting
from
his
horse
you
will
bring
the
rebels
on
me
that
s
a
little
boy
but
he
is
union
all
over
he
added
turning
to
leon
now
you
stay
here
and
hold
my
horse
and
i
will
go
in
and
get
things
ready
i
needn
t
tell
you
to
keep
a
good
watch
down
the
road
if
you
hear
so
much
as
a
i
want
to
know
now
hold
on
a
bit
said
tom
dismounting
and
handing
his
reins
to
leon
to
hold
for
him
if
you
are
going
to
leave
us
here
in
silence
i
must
take
care
of
my
muel
else
she
will
arouse
the
neighborhood
you
hold
her
head
leon
and
i
will
look
out
for
her
well
why
don
t
you
take
care
of
it
then
asked
leon
when
he
saw
tom
station
himself
in
such
a
position
that
he
could
readily
seize
her
tail
in
moments
of
emergency
because
she
isn
t
ready
to
bray
yet
said
tom
whenever
she
gets
ready
to
let
the
people
know
she
is
here
she
will
bob
her
tail
up
and
down
then
i
will
be
ready
to
take
hold
of
it
and
keep
it
down
oh
there
s
a
heap
to
be
learned
about
muels
the
first
thing
you
dawson
couldn
t
keep
from
laughing
if
he
knew
his
mother
was
in
went
on
into
the
house
the
door
of
which
was
closed
after
him
so
leon
didn
t
hear
much
of
that
greeting
and
he
wouldn
t
have
learned
much
if
he
had
heard
it
his
mother
had
lived
in
danger
for
the
last
year
and
all
she
did
was
to
kiss
him
and
listen
while
he
told
of
his
capture
but
i
wanted
to
go
said
he
and
father
and
i
promised
each
other
that
whoever
got
away
first
should
go
to
jones
county
and
the
one
that
was
left
in
the
rebel
ranks
should
come
there
as
soon
as
he
could
i
got
away
first
and
now
i
am
come
after
you
pack
up
everything
you
want
and
be
ready
to
load
it
aboard
the
which
i
will
bring
here
as
soon
as
will
i
be
protected
there
asked
his
mother
you
certainly
will
there
is
a
thousand
men
there
and
they
are
growing
every
day
i
wouldn
t
ask
you
to
stir
a
step
if
i
didn
t
think
so
your
house
is
gone
well
i
can
t
help
that
but
do
you
really
think
your
father
will
be
able
to
join
us
there
he
s
got
to
take
his
chances
that
s
what
i
had
to
do
now
mother
take
everything
you
need
and
leave
the
rest
behind
for
the
this
was
all
that
was
said
and
dawson
left
the
house
and
went
out
to
his
companions
but
he
knew
that
his
mother
had
gone
hastily
to
work
to
bundle
up
such
things
as
she
needed
and
could
not
possibly
do
without
he
took
his
bridle
from
leon
s
hand
and
with
a
whispered
follow
me
led
the
way
around
behind
a
out
of
sight
now
i
must
leave
you
again
and
you
will
take
notice
that
your
horses
don
t
let
anyone
know
they
are
here
said
dawson
i
am
going
to
get
a
your
mother
is
going
is
she
asked
tom
of
course
she
s
going
she
would
look
nice
living
in
that
house
while
she
had
a
husband
and
son
in
the
yankee
army
of
course
we
have
seen
the
house
for
the
last
time
the
rebels
will
burn
it
up
the
first
time
they
come
this
while
dawson
was
getting
ready
to
go
out
and
get
the
the
boys
noticed
that
their
horses
raised
their
heads
and
pricked
their
ears
forward
and
looked
down
the
road
as
if
there
was
some
object
down
there
that
attracted
their
attention
dawson
was
the
first
to
notice
it
and
he
straightway
grabbed
his
horse
by
the
bridle
and
forced
his
head
down
somebody
s
coming
said
he
leon
speedily
dismounted
and
took
up
a
position
by
his
horse
s
bridle
tom
gave
his
reins
into
his
hand
and
occupied
his
old
station
by
his
mule
s
tail
and
all
the
boys
held
their
breath
and
listened
it
was
faint
and
far
off
but
presently
they
could
distinctly
hear
the
sound
of
a
multitude
of
horses
hoofs
upon
the
hard
road
nearer
it
came
until
dawson
who
was
experienced
in
such
matters
informed
his
companions
in
a
whisper
that
there
must
be
a
whole
platoon
of
cavalry
approaching
it
came
from
the
south
too
and
that
was
the
direction
in
which
the
rebel
headquarters
were
situated
i
tell
you
it
s
lucky
that
we
got
here
just
in
the
nick
of
time
said
tom
hold
on
there
old
muel
he
continued
catching
the
mule
s
tail
and
pulling
it
down
you
mustn
t
let
those
folks
know
we
re
here
did
you
see
how
i
stopped
his
braying
leon
and
dawson
were
too
deeply
interested
in
what
was
going
on
in
the
road
to
pay
much
attention
to
him
and
finally
they
could
see
through
the
cracks
in
the
where
the
chinking
had
fallen
out
a
number
of
men
ride
past
the
house
or
rather
the
majority
of
them
rode
by
while
three
drew
rein
and
stopped
there
by
gracious
i
hope
mother
heard
them
and
that
she
had
time
to
put
her
bundles
away
out
of
sight
whispered
dawson
everything
depends
upon
where
do
you
suppose
they
are
going
asked
leon
who
was
so
excited
that
he
could
scarcely
speak
they
are
going
up
to
jones
county
to
see
how
nearly
ready
for
them
we
are
said
dawson
i
reckon
they
ll
stop
when
they
get
to
the
bridge
there
are
some
riflemen
up
there
that
act
to
me
as
if
they
were
good
now
here
s
a
thing
that
bothers
me
said
leon
you
are
talking
about
getting
a
to
haul
your
mother
s
things
to
our
county
and
i
would
like
to
know
how
we
are
to
get
it
by
those
fellows
we
ll
have
to
wait
until
they
go
dawson
did
not
answer
at
once
for
he
was
much
concerned
about
those
three
men
who
rode
into
the
yard
he
saw
one
of
them
dismount
and
go
into
the
house
and
his
heart
beat
like
a
when
he
saw
it
he
waited
for
the
confusion
which
he
knew
would
follow
when
the
bundles
his
mother
had
made
up
were
exposed
to
view
but
it
did
not
come
in
a
few
minutes
the
man
came
out
and
spoke
to
the
two
men
he
had
left
on
horseback
and
they
went
on
and
the
rebel
turned
and
came
directly
toward
the
he
s
coming
here
said
leon
and
before
anybody
could
say
a
word
against
it
he
had
cocked
his
revolver
rested
it
in
the
crack
and
pointed
it
at
the
man
s
head
he
was
right
in
front
of
the
open
doorway
and
of
course
leon
couldn
t
have
missed
him
at
that
distance
the
rebel
came
on
as
though
he
knew
where
he
was
going
entered
the
doorway
placed
his
mouth
close
to
the
crack
and
whispered
robert
for
goodness
sake
turn
that
revolver
the
other
way
whispered
dawson
it
is
my
chapter
cale
wants
a
mule
i
am
to
go
to
the
quartermaster
am
i
it
is
his
business
to
give
the
muels
out
is
it
he
give
one
to
that
tom
howe
and
never
asked
what
he
was
going
to
do
with
him
and
now
he
had
to
go
and
refuse
to
give
one
to
me
i
ll
get
even
with
you
sprague
for
that
and
you
just
see
if
i
don
it
was
newman
who
spoke
and
he
leaned
against
the
corner
of
the
hotel
and
watched
sprague
as
he
went
on
inspecting
the
wagons
he
was
a
boy
about
nineteen
years
old
although
he
might
have
passed
for
thirty
judging
by
his
looks
he
didn
t
have
a
rifle
in
fact
he
didn
t
have
anything
except
the
big
hunk
of
which
he
took
from
his
pocket
transferring
a
generous
slice
to
his
mouth
he
was
not
a
raftsman
anybody
could
have
told
that
for
they
generally
took
some
pains
with
their
personal
appearance
this
newman
was
ragged
and
dirty
and
looked
as
though
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
sleeping
wherever
night
overtook
him
he
had
the
appearance
of
being
mean
enough
for
anything
and
the
facts
proved
that
he
was
see
that
ole
sprague
stepping
around
like
he
owned
the
nation
muttered
newman
shutting
one
eye
and
squirting
a
flow
of
at
the
nearest
tree
i
ll
see
pap
and
if
he
thinks
it
can
be
done
i
am
going
to
do
it
that
rolling
officer
when
he
was
here
told
them
that
they
couldn
t
have
things
all
their
own
way
and
i
guess
they
will
find
it
out
they
will
give
me
something
for
telling
them
where
they
can
find
the
men
and
i
ll
be
if
i
don
t
do
it
where
s
that
quartermaster
i
wonder
busy
as
usual
i
ll
bet
well
let
him
work
his
own
gait
he
won
t
do
it
much
newman
stayed
around
almost
all
day
before
he
got
a
chance
to
speak
to
the
quartermaster
and
before
he
went
away
there
was
something
that
drew
his
attention
from
sprague
to
leon
the
latter
and
two
companions
came
up
to
report
what
had
happened
at
sprague
s
plantation
since
his
absence
leon
made
a
handsome
figure
if
he
only
knew
it
he
sat
his
horse
with
easy
grace
was
clad
in
a
suit
of
blue
jeans
which
fitted
his
person
admirably
and
he
raised
his
hand
to
his
father
with
a
military
salute
that
would
have
done
credit
to
an
old
soldier
newman
did
not
hear
any
of
his
report
for
it
was
given
in
tones
so
low
that
they
could
not
reach
his
ears
but
if
he
had
heard
any
of
it
it
would
have
shown
the
necessity
of
his
being
up
and
doing
see
how
easily
he
touches
his
hat
to
that
old
civilian
said
newman
with
a
sneer
while
my
father
who
could
have
had
that
position
if
the
folks
had
been
to
give
it
to
him
has
to
go
around
without
anybody
saluting
him
such
things
ain
t
right
but
i
tell
you
i
am
going
to
make
them
that
way
they
offered
my
father
something
nice
if
he
would
betray
these
chief
men
into
their
didn
t
say
what
it
would
be
but
i
suppose
it
is
some
he
don
t
seem
willing
to
do
it
i
ll
do
it
and
see
what
they
will
give
me
there
s
the
quartermaster
now
and
he
don
t
seem
to
be
newman
threw
his
tobacco
out
of
his
mouth
and
walked
up
to
the
quartermaster
who
stood
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
watching
some
wagons
that
were
being
hitched
up
previous
to
being
hauled
into
the
swamp
i
want
to
see
if
you
will
give
me
a
muel
please
sir
said
newman
stepping
up
and
trying
his
best
to
give
the
military
salute
as
he
had
seen
leon
do
a
mule
what
do
you
want
of
a
mule
said
the
officer
more
than
half
inclined
to
laugh
at
the
boy
s
appearance
you
don
t
want
a
mule
to
ride
up
to
the
no
sir
but
i
want
him
so
as
to
be
ready
to
go
with
the
men
when
they
capture
another
said
newman
why
you
didn
t
go
with
the
men
the
other
day
i
saw
you
around
here
the
whole
time
your
father
was
with
you
and
so
was
dan
was
newman
s
oldest
brother
all
we
can
say
about
him
is
that
he
was
cale
newman
over
again
dan
was
the
one
that
stole
the
bacon
and
sweet
potatoes
that
the
family
lived
on
he
had
courage
to
go
where
cale
wouldn
t
dare
show
his
head
but
we
would
to
go
afoot
said
newman
in
an
injured
tone
i
couldn
t
walk
so
it
seems
the
others
did
it
without
any
trouble
you
could
have
gone
there
and
showed
your
if
you
had
been
to
i
reckon
you
will
find
it
better
to
do
without
a
you
gave
tom
howe
one
and
said
nothing
about
it
said
newman
growing
angry
again
i
did
said
the
quartermaster
old
sprague
done
it
and
it
amounts
to
the
same
look
here
newman
you
want
to
be
careful
how
you
talk
about
that
man
he
ain
t
a
common
civilian
any
what
is
he
then
i
would
like
to
know
he
s
got
power
enough
to
put
you
where
people
won
t
hear
you
say
that
said
the
officer
fastening
his
eyes
sternly
on
newman
s
face
he
will
put
you
in
well
i
ll
bet
he
won
t
put
me
in
jail
neither
my
father
has
got
friends
enough
to
tear
it
well
cale
if
you
are
going
to
hold
to
such
doctrines
as
that
you
might
as
well
go
among
the
confederates
where
you
belong
you
don
t
belong
here
that
is
if
you
will
give
me
a
muel
i
won
t
hold
no
such
docterings
said
newman
i
ll
be
the
loyalest
fellow
you
ever
the
quartermaster
looked
at
newman
in
amazement
what
kind
of
a
fellow
are
you
any
way
he
asked
you
are
going
to
be
loyal
or
not
just
as
you
get
paid
for
that
s
the
way
my
father
looks
at
it
you
didn
t
give
him
an
office
and
now
he
s
going
to
let
you
hoe
your
own
row
now
if
i
could
have
a
muel
to
ride
well
you
ll
not
get
any
i
can
tell
you
that
and
furthermore
if
i
hear
any
more
such
talk
from
you
i
ll
have
you
my
father
i
ve
heard
enough
don
t
speak
to
me
again
a
man
who
will
depend
upon
a
mule
for
his
loyalty
don
t
amount
to
much
now
go
away
and
don
t
let
me
see
you
the
quartermaster
was
very
angry
as
he
turned
away
and
newman
stood
and
watched
him
while
he
went
on
inspecting
the
wagons
then
he
took
a
chew
of
shook
his
head
threateningly
and
turned
his
steps
toward
home
you
have
heard
enough
have
you
he
muttered
as
he
followed
the
blind
path
that
led
through
the
woods
toward
the
little
shanty
under
which
his
family
found
shelter
well
i
ll
bet
you
will
hear
more
of
it
before
night
if
father
don
t
give
you
into
the
hands
of
the
rebels
i
when
newman
arrived
within
sight
of
his
home
he
found
his
father
sitting
on
the
smoking
his
pipe
while
his
brother
dan
was
stretched
in
a
sunny
spot
where
he
could
enjoy
the
full
benefit
of
the
warmth
without
going
near
the
fire
his
mother
was
engaged
in
a
lazy
sort
of
way
over
a
blaze
which
had
been
started
in
the
fireplace
that
is
to
say
she
was
sitting
down
and
watching
a
pot
that
had
been
set
over
the
coals
while
a
dingy
cob
pipe
like
her
husband
s
was
tightly
clasped
between
her
teeth
the
house
was
a
affair
and
looked
as
though
it
was
about
to
come
to
pieces
with
a
dirt
floor
and
the
door
beside
which
newman
was
sitting
was
minus
a
hinge
near
the
top
the
family
were
all
of
them
what
might
have
been
expected
by
this
description
of
their
place
of
abode
and
the
work
which
might
have
been
accomplished
by
one
man
in
three
or
four
days
to
make
his
house
worth
living
in
was
not
above
newman
s
ability
for
he
showed
on
his
face
that
he
had
seen
better
times
he
had
been
wealthy
once
but
now
he
had
lost
it
and
was
much
too
lazy
to
go
to
work
and
earn
more
that
accounted
for
cale
s
way
of
talking
he
didn
t
say
pap
and
mam
unless
he
spoke
before
he
thought
for
he
considered
himself
better
than
those
with
whom
he
associated
the
raftsmen
used
to
say
that
if
newman
s
work
was
equal
to
his
talk
he
would
have
a
much
better
house
to
live
in
well
cale
what
s
the
matter
with
you
inquired
his
father
as
the
approached
the
place
where
they
were
sitting
you
act
as
though
you
had
lost
your
last
i
want
to
tell
you
what
has
happened
down
there
in
town
and
see
if
you
wouldn
t
look
so
too
said
cale
seating
himself
on
the
ground
i
asked
old
sprague
and
the
quartermaster
nothing
exclaimed
newman
who
gave
him
such
an
office
as
that
he
had
the
handling
of
the
mules
and
horses
and
would
not
give
you
that
s
just
the
way
of
it
said
cale
now
i
want
to
know
if
such
a
thing
is
right
he
gave
tom
howe
one
and
never
said
nothing
about
it
but
he
wouldn
t
give
me
one
for
fear
that
i
wouldn
t
be
on
hand
when
he
was
going
out
to
capture
the
next
no
more
would
you
said
his
mother
at
that
moment
appearing
at
the
door
to
hear
what
cale
had
to
say
you
ain
t
on
that
side
the
south
is
going
to
whip
and
you
don
t
want
to
be
beholden
to
those
fellows
for
i
told
em
if
they
would
give
me
a
muel
i
would
be
just
the
loyalest
fellow
he
ever
saw
said
cale
the
more
shame
to
you
said
his
mother
angrily
well
i
don
t
know
about
that
chimed
in
newman
if
he
could
get
a
mule
or
one
of
the
horses
he
could
fly
around
easy
carrying
dispatches
and
the
like
he
could
be
here
and
see
what
was
going
on
and
he
could
get
on
his
mule
and
take
the
news
down
to
the
confederates
wouldn
t
he
give
you
a
mule
no
he
wouldn
t
i
tried
sprague
and
the
quartermaster
too
and
they
both
threatened
to
arrest
me
if
i
talked
so
any
well
i
do
think
in
my
soul
that
they
are
getting
on
a
high
horse
said
newman
taking
the
pipe
from
his
mouth
i
d
like
to
see
them
arrest
you
or
anybody
connected
with
this
family
their
old
jail
would
stay
up
about
as
long
as
i
could
get
to
it
with
an
that
s
what
i
told
em
and
he
said
that
i
mustn
t
talk
that
way
any
say
said
dan
who
had
mustered
up
energy
enough
to
straighten
up
during
this
talk
and
was
now
engaged
in
filling
a
cob
pipe
with
some
you
don
t
suppose
that
the
men
who
were
captured
with
that
have
gone
on
to
mobile
do
you
it
seems
to
me
that
they
ought
to
be
back
here
or
them
fellows
ain
t
to
stand
still
and
let
themselves
be
robbed
of
half
a
million
dollars
don
t
i
wish
i
had
the
stuff
that
s
in
one
of
them
wagons
exclaimed
cale
there
s
grub
enough
to
keep
our
jaws
wagging
for
one
good
solid
year
and
clothes
you
just
ought
to
see
the
uniforms
there
is
in
i
came
away
before
they
got
to
inspecting
the
wagons
said
newman
somehow
i
couldn
t
manage
to
stay
around
and
see
the
clothes
and
things
our
fellows
were
going
to
wear
go
to
those
lazy
that
was
one
reason
why
newman
came
away
before
the
wagons
were
overhauled
but
the
principal
motive
that
governed
him
was
because
he
did
not
want
to
see
others
saluted
his
attention
was
first
called
to
it
by
the
actions
of
bud
mccoy
bud
didn
t
care
for
anything
but
he
seemed
to
be
carried
away
by
his
union
sentiment
and
once
when
he
spoke
to
sprague
he
did
it
without
saluting
but
he
thought
of
it
at
once
and
came
back
and
touched
his
hat
to
him
i
declare
secretary
of
war
i
almost
forgot
my
manners
to
you
i
forgot
that
you
ain
t
a
plain
raftsman
any
newman
would
have
given
a
good
deal
if
he
could
have
been
saluted
that
way
and
because
he
was
not
he
didn
t
care
to
stay
around
where
the
crowd
was
mr
sprague
let
on
that
he
didn
t
want
to
be
saluted
every
time
a
man
spoke
to
him
but
i
know
a
story
worth
two
of
that
said
newman
getting
upon
his
feet
and
pacing
up
and
down
in
front
of
his
house
i
am
better
able
to
hold
that
position
than
anybody
else
because
i
have
seen
more
military
than
they
have
but
no
they
had
to
go
and
give
it
to
a
man
who
don
t
know
a
thing
about
that
s
just
what
i
told
them
said
cale
and
what
did
they
say
they
said
i
couldn
t
have
the
well
now
if
those
fellows
come
back
here
said
dan
what
s
the
reason
we
can
t
help
them
get
all
the
chief
men
of
the
county
i
am
in
it
for
here
too
said
cale
you
must
be
careful
what
you
do
said
newman
they
have
got
sentries
posted
down
there
and
you
can
t
get
by
them
without
the
then
we
ll
go
below
the
bridge
and
swim
the
creek
said
dan
if
i
go
into
this
business
i
shall
go
in
all
if
you
will
do
that
you
may
be
able
to
get
me
the
commission
of
colonel
of
the
confederate
army
said
newman
i
never
told
you
this
before
but
i
shall
ask
that
or
a
colonel
ejaculated
cale
with
intense
enthusiasm
then
you
will
have
command
he
rides
a
horse
doesn
t
he
he
certainly
does
and
he
s
got
a
commission
backed
by
a
government
he
s
higher
than
the
president
of
the
confederacy
that
s
the
commission
i
am
working
one
would
not
have
thought
that
newman
was
working
very
hard
for
that
commission
to
have
seen
him
at
that
moment
in
fact
he
did
not
seem
to
be
working
for
anything
he
was
sitting
there
perfectly
quiet
and
waiting
for
the
commission
to
come
to
him
i
tell
you
boys
you
must
work
hard
for
that
colonel
s
said
newman
taking
her
stand
in
the
door
with
her
arms
placed
on
her
hips
you
won
t
be
wearing
no
ragged
clothes
like
you
be
now
and
i
ll
have
a
silk
dress
to
wear
at
all
seasons
you
won
t
catch
me
around
cooking
as
i
am
now
i
ll
be
a
lady
and
have
a
better
pipe
than
this
to
and
who
knows
but
that
father
might
get
us
something
said
dan
i
ll
bet
if
you
held
old
sprague
s
position
you
would
give
me
something
besides
a
private
in
your
that
s
just
what
i
am
thinking
of
returned
newman
your
father
was
telling
me
about
it
last
night
of
course
he
would
have
a
staff
and
you
two
would
come
in
for
two
of
the
offices
mighty
handy
i
tell
you
you
want
to
work
hard
your
father
doesn
t
seem
to
be
able
to
do
and
what
is
the
reason
exclaimed
newman
taking
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
with
one
hand
and
extending
the
other
toward
his
wife
do
you
suppose
i
am
going
to
run
down
there
among
all
that
crowd
and
stand
all
the
risk
of
getting
my
neck
stretched
for
treachery
the
boys
can
do
what
they
please
and
nobody
will
say
a
word
to
them
but
let
me
go
down
there
and
carry
news
of
what
has
been
going
on
and
you
will
see
how
long
you
have
got
a
husband
to
take
care
of
you
it
ain
t
safe
for
me
to
go
i
didn
t
think
about
your
being
hung
said
newman
indifferently
of
course
that
is
what
they
are
up
to
and
they
are
thinking
now
how
it
could
be
yes
exclaimed
cale
they
told
me
that
i
had
best
go
among
the
rebels
where
i
don
t
that
prove
what
i
said
i
ain
t
going
down
there
any
more
but
i
want
to
see
them
lock
you
up
if
they
dare
do
it
that
s
what
i
am
aching
but
cale
didn
t
agree
with
his
father
s
opinions
in
regard
to
locking
him
up
and
he
secretly
resolved
that
he
wouldn
t
say
anything
more
in
the
presence
of
the
quartermaster
that
would
lead
him
to
carry
that
resolution
into
effect
his
father
filled
his
pipe
and
sat
down
in
his
usual
place
in
the
doorway
and
cale
following
the
motion
of
dan
s
head
accompanied
him
around
behind
the
house
newman
didn
t
care
where
they
went
or
what
they
did
while
they
were
gone
all
he
thought
of
was
the
carrying
out
of
dan
s
proposition
to
surrender
the
head
men
of
the
confederacy
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
it
looked
like
a
very
small
piece
of
business
for
a
father
to
put
this
into
his
sons
hands
but
newman
thought
he
was
acting
just
right
the
boys
were
gone
half
an
hour
or
more
and
came
back
in
time
to
get
something
to
eat
they
sat
down
to
their
supper
in
silence
and
when
they
had
got
through
they
put
on
their
hats
and
left
the
house
they
didn
t
take
their
dogs
with
them
and
that
proved
that
they
were
not
going
after
wild
hogs
you
just
let
those
boys
alone
said
newman
looking
down
the
path
along
which
they
had
gone
with
some
satisfaction
they
are
going
to
get
whatever
they
go
i
think
it
would
have
been
some
honor
to
you
if
you
had
gone
in
their
place
said
his
wife
somehow
it
don
t
seem
right
to
leave
the
capturing
of
so
many
men
to
yes
and
run
the
risk
of
stretching
hemp
replied
newman
indignantly
those
boys
can
be
away
from
home
as
much
as
they
are
to
and
nobody
will
say
a
word
but
if
i
go
down
to
where
the
men
are
and
find
out
something
about
them
they
would
know
in
a
minute
if
i
wasn
t
at
home
like
i
had
oughter
be
and
i
don
t
want
them
to
ask
that
question
let
the
boys
go
on
we
ll
have
some
of
them
men
arrested
the
first
thing
you
but
how
are
they
going
to
arrest
them
are
they
going
to
come
here
and
take
them
no
it
will
be
in
a
fight
and
where
will
you
be
when
the
fight
comes
off
oh
i
ll
be
around
somewhere
you
look
out
for
yourself
and
let
your
husband
look
out
for
himself
that
s
the
way
to
do
i
wish
we
had
a
muel
to
ride
said
dan
as
they
trudged
through
the
woods
toward
the
creek
somehow
it
puts
me
on
nettles
to
walk
now
that
tom
howe
has
got
a
muel
i
don
t
see
why
we
can
t
have
one
we
ought
to
have
gone
with
them
men
that
captured
that
but
we
had
no
guns
said
cale
no
but
we
would
soon
have
had
them
there
s
lots
of
guns
in
the
president
s
headquarters
that
haven
t
got
any
owners
tom
didn
t
have
a
muel
and
now
he
s
got
and
that
s
what
comes
of
touching
his
hat
to
those
civilians
said
cale
in
disgust
i
bet
you
i
wouldn
t
do
it
why
didn
t
they
give
father
a
position
like
he
ought
to
have
had
we
would
have
had
muels
by
this
it
s
my
opinion
that
father
has
got
his
foot
in
it
said
dan
with
a
knowing
shake
of
his
head
he
has
said
all
along
that
the
south
was
going
to
whip
and
old
sprague
and
the
other
men
don
t
like
it
i
ll
bet
you
that
if
the
truth
was
known
half
of
them
are
on
our
this
was
the
substance
of
the
conversation
that
passed
between
dan
and
cale
on
their
way
to
the
creek
boys
as
they
were
they
had
every
reason
to
believe
that
one
county
could
not
stand
against
the
whole
southern
confederacy
that
the
union
men
in
the
county
were
going
to
be
easily
whipped
out
and
they
wanted
to
be
on
the
winning
side
perhaps
there
was
a
little
hope
of
plunder
mixed
in
with
it
as
cale
finally
said
i
ll
tell
you
what
dan
i
don
t
like
the
way
that
young
sprague
had
of
throwing
on
style
he
rode
up
on
that
colt
of
his
and
saluted
the
old
man
as
if
he
were
the
owner
of
the
state
i
d
like
to
have
him
go
afoot
for
awhile
and
let
me
ride
on
that
well
he
ll
have
to
do
it
returned
dan
but
he
s
got
some
other
things
that
i
d
like
to
revolver
for
before
long
it
began
to
grow
dark
but
the
gloom
that
settled
over
the
woods
did
not
interfere
with
the
movements
of
these
backwoodsmen
they
kept
straight
ahead
as
though
it
had
been
broad
daylight
and
finally
arrived
on
the
banks
of
the
creek
without
saying
a
word
they
threw
off
their
clothes
and
prepared
to
plunge
into
the
stream
if
they
had
known
as
much
as
leon
did
they
would
have
looked
for
that
ford
which
was
but
a
short
distance
from
the
place
where
they
swam
the
creek
the
water
was
somewhat
cold
but
they
took
it
bravely
and
in
a
few
minutes
more
stood
on
the
opposite
side
that
leon
is
going
to
have
a
colder
place
than
this
said
dan
as
he
shiveringly
put
on
his
clothes
i
do
wish
they
would
turn
him
and
tom
over
to
what
would
you
do
with
him
i
d
make
him
swim
this
perhaps
he
wouldn
t
do
he
wouldn
t
eh
wait
until
he
sees
his
revolver
looking
him
squarely
in
the
face
i
bet
you
he
would
go
now
we
want
to
be
still
for
we
don
t
know
how
close
those
sentries
are
to
us
we
must
keep
mum
and
make
as
little
noise
as
possible
in
going
through
the
woods
until
we
find
out
where
they
cale
was
now
perfectly
willing
that
dan
should
take
the
lead
for
as
they
were
getting
pretty
close
to
armed
men
he
did
not
want
to
be
the
first
to
draw
their
fire
so
he
gradually
fell
behind
while
dan
made
his
way
through
the
bushes
with
an
ease
and
celerity
that
was
astonishing
he
scarcely
caused
a
twig
to
rustle
the
experience
which
the
boys
had
in
hunting
wild
hogs
stood
them
well
in
stead
finally
dan
pushed
aside
the
bushes
and
saw
the
road
fairly
before
him
there
was
nothing
on
it
as
far
as
he
could
see
and
the
bridge
seemed
to
be
empty
somebody
has
been
fooled
in
regard
to
those
sentinels
said
dan
go
out
in
the
road
said
cale
you
can
t
see
anything
from
dan
went
but
had
scarcely
got
clear
of
the
bushes
when
a
voice
called
out
in
a
surprised
tone
halt
by
gum
i
guess
you
found
something
whispered
cale
you
had
better
be
getting
out
of
dan
waited
to
hear
no
more
he
drew
a
for
the
bushes
and
in
a
moment
more
was
threading
his
way
noisely
through
them
when
he
had
gone
a
little
ways
he
stopped
and
said
to
his
brother
i
didn
t
see
anybody
no
but
they
are
there
and
they
saw
you
said
cale
who
was
greatly
excited
now
what
s
to
be
done
i
wish
that
cavalry
would
come
along
now
and
we
would
have
those
sentinels
took
in
out
of
the
wet
i
hope
they
did
not
see
nor
me
i
wouldn
t
dare
go
back
home
again
let
s
sit
down
here
a
believe
i
would
rather
go
a
little
further
away
said
cale
suppose
some
officer
should
come
along
the
road
dan
answered
this
question
by
seating
himself
on
the
nearest
log
and
resting
his
chin
on
his
hands
he
wasn
t
going
any
further
and
cale
rather
than
be
left
alone
in
the
woods
took
a
place
by
his
side
they
stayed
there
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
without
saying
a
word
except
cale
who
wished
they
had
a
gun
so
that
they
could
tumble
the
officer
over
when
he
came
along
to
see
where
they
went
and
then
they
heard
another
challenge
to
halt
from
the
sentinel
on
the
bridge
there
now
i
ll
bet
there
is
somebody
else
coming
said
cale
his
excitement
and
fear
increasing
tenfold
well
he
didn
t
come
by
here
said
dan
who
sat
where
he
could
see
everybody
who
passed
along
the
road
no
but
he
came
from
ellisville
who
knows
but
there
was
someone
there
watching
our
house
and
who
saw
us
when
we
came
away
that
s
so
said
dan
but
he
didn
t
seem
to
be
much
worried
by
it
well
now
i
say
let
s
go
a
little
further
but
dan
kept
his
seat
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
road
and
while
his
brother
was
trying
to
make
up
his
mind
whether
or
not
he
ought
to
leave
him
they
heard
the
clatter
of
horses
hoofs
on
the
bridge
and
even
dan
began
to
prick
his
ears
it
was
a
small
party
of
horsemen
who
were
coming
directly
along
the
road
of
which
he
kept
watch
they
were
walking
their
horses
and
that
made
the
spies
eager
to
escape
observation
dan
stretched
himself
out
at
full
length
in
the
bushes
his
example
being
promptly
followed
by
cale
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
horsemen
rode
by
but
they
saw
nothing
to
excite
their
suspicions
and
in
a
few
seconds
more
they
passed
out
of
hearing
don
t
i
wish
i
had
a
gun
exclaimed
dan
raising
himself
on
his
knees
and
going
through
all
the
motions
he
would
make
in
covering
the
horsemen
who
was
it
asked
cale
it
was
leon
that
worthless
tom
howe
and
that
rebel
fellow
that
they
have
been
running
with
since
yesterday
said
dan
now
i
wish
your
squad
of
cavalry
would
come
along
but
you
see
we
hain
t
got
no
guns
and
each
one
of
them
has
got
a
cale
had
never
been
more
astonished
in
his
life
chapter
xi
dawson
s
strategy
yes
sir
i
wish
i
had
a
gun
in
my
hands
said
dan
rising
to
his
feet
and
gazing
down
the
road
in
the
direction
in
which
the
horsemen
had
disappeared
i
could
have
tumbled
that
leon
sprague
off
his
horse
just
as
easy
as
not
and
i
might
have
had
if
there
had
been
any
way
for
me
to
earn
there
had
been
plenty
of
ways
for
him
to
earn
a
gun
or
for
the
matter
of
that
some
better
clothes
than
he
wore
if
it
had
not
been
for
his
disinclination
to
work
he
could
have
gone
into
the
woods
almost
any
time
and
made
a
man
s
wages
by
chopping
but
that
was
niggers
work
and
a
little
too
low
down
for
him
newman
and
his
boys
had
tried
it
once
but
the
men
who
had
charge
of
them
were
so
cross
and
snappish
and
wanted
them
to
do
so
much
more
work
than
they
did
that
they
could
no
longer
stand
it
at
the
end
of
three
days
they
came
home
with
their
axes
put
them
up
in
a
corner
and
vowed
that
they
would
hunt
wild
hogs
with
their
dogs
and
stick
them
with
their
knives
rather
than
work
under
such
and
if
their
father
wouldn
t
do
it
they
might
be
sure
that
the
boys
would
not
for
dan
and
cale
looked
for
better
times
without
doing
a
thing
to
bring
them
about
they
preferred
to
be
were
squatters
even
the
ground
their
house
was
built
upon
did
not
belong
to
whenever
anybody
came
near
losing
his
life
as
tom
howe
had
come
near
losing
his
during
the
last
spring
drive
it
pleased
them
wonderfully
that
little
episode
added
to
their
enmity
against
leon
sprague
according
to
their
belief
leon
ought
to
have
stood
on
a
log
and
seen
him
go
under
i
didn
t
see
anybody
go
by
said
cale
i
don
t
suppose
you
did
said
dan
with
something
like
a
sneer
you
are
like
an
ostrich
whenever
they
get
frightened
they
hide
their
heads
and
think
their
body
can
t
be
seen
now
let
s
go
down
this
way
a
little
further
and
then
we
ll
lay
in
the
bushes
and
see
what
s
going
to
what
do
you
suppose
that
rebel
fellow
has
come
out
here
with
leon
for
said
cale
has
he
got
any
relatives
or
things
down
here
that
he
is
going
after
that
s
just
what
s
of
me
i
don
t
know
but
we
can
watch
and
find
out
now
we
ll
wait
until
they
come
back
said
dan
picking
out
a
comfortable
seat
for
himself
against
a
tree
where
the
bushes
were
so
thick
that
one
might
have
passed
within
five
feet
of
him
without
knowing
that
he
was
there
he
s
a
rebel
he
deserted
to
the
enemy
with
a
uniform
on
and
if
we
see
some
confederates
come
along
here
we
will
tell
them
where
he
but
we
don
t
know
where
he
is
said
cale
looking
around
to
find
an
easy
spot
to
sit
down
well
the
rebels
can
easy
watch
here
until
he
comes
back
retorted
his
brother
what
s
there
to
hinder
them
from
jumping
out
on
him
and
taking
him
and
all
that
he
s
got
into
the
bargain
now
i
like
when
i
am
sitting
down
in
this
way
to
talk
about
what
i
am
going
to
do
with
those
things
we
are
going
to
take
away
from
leon
i
speak
for
his
this
started
cale
off
on
a
new
subject
and
it
wasn
t
long
before
he
forgot
that
there
were
armed
men
within
less
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
him
if
leon
and
tom
could
have
been
dealt
with
as
these
young
backwoodsmen
wanted
them
to
be
it
wouldn
t
be
long
before
they
would
have
changed
places
they
probably
passed
an
hour
in
talking
over
their
various
plans
and
then
they
were
brought
to
an
abrupt
silence
by
the
sound
of
horses
hoofs
upon
the
road
the
men
had
been
advancing
so
cautiously
that
they
were
close
upon
them
before
they
knew
it
cale
whose
greatest
care
was
to
keep
out
of
sight
at
once
stretched
himself
at
full
length
in
the
bushes
while
dan
who
wanted
to
see
who
the
men
were
raised
himself
to
his
full
height
and
looked
over
the
thicket
what
he
saw
was
about
a
dozen
men
all
on
horseback
and
noted
too
that
they
were
all
dressed
in
confederate
uniform
but
one
thing
that
astonished
him
was
a
revolver
that
was
pointed
straight
at
his
head
the
leader
of
the
horsemen
was
an
old
soldier
and
he
could
not
be
taken
unawares
halloo
by
george
there
s
a
yank
he
exclaimed
come
out
of
dan
was
thunderstruck
he
had
never
expected
to
be
greeted
this
way
by
his
friends
and
for
a
moment
or
two
he
stood
with
his
hands
down
by
his
side
unable
to
move
or
speak
while
cale
uttering
a
smothered
ejaculation
began
to
worm
his
way
out
of
the
bushes
on
his
belly
hold
on
there
are
two
of
you
there
and
if
you
move
another
hair
i
will
cut
loose
on
you
shouted
the
leader
and
to
show
that
he
was
in
earnest
he
turned
his
horse
and
rode
into
the
woods
his
men
were
with
him
and
when
dan
cleared
his
eyes
of
a
mist
that
seemed
to
obstruct
their
vision
he
found
that
there
were
half
a
dozen
revolvers
looking
at
him
we
ve
got
you
and
you
might
as
well
come
out
where
do
you
belong
are
you
confederates
stammered
dan
of
course
we
are
what
did
you
take
us
for
come
out
of
well
now
if
you
are
confederates
you
want
to
turn
those
weapons
the
other
way
said
dan
growing
bolder
when
he
heard
his
own
voice
i
am
as
good
a
confederate
as
you
oh
well
then
it
is
all
right
come
out
here
on
the
road
so
that
we
can
talk
to
you
get
up
there
you
fellow
lying
in
those
bushes
you
needn
t
think
we
are
going
to
hurt
you
now
then
what
do
you
know
have
you
seen
any
confederates
around
here
no
i
haven
t
but
say
added
dan
who
had
by
this
time
taken
up
his
stand
in
the
road
and
grew
bolder
when
he
saw
that
none
of
the
soldiers
addressed
him
by
name
you
want
to
get
all
the
head
men
of
jones
county
in
your
hands
don
t
you
well
i
should
say
so
exclaimed
the
leader
showing
more
enthusiasm
than
he
had
thus
far
exhibited
can
you
put
me
in
the
way
of
getting
my
hands
onto
them
how
much
will
you
give
said
dan
how
much
will
i
give
asked
the
leader
as
if
he
did
not
quite
catch
dan
s
meaning
yes
my
father
had
some
talk
with
you
fellows
about
it
and
he
says
he
is
working
for
a
colonel
s
commission
he
won
t
work
for
any
less
now
you
can
afford
to
give
me
captain
and
my
brother
here
lieutenant
can
t
you
the
captain
for
that
s
who
he
was
was
taken
aback
by
this
bold
declaration
on
the
part
of
dan
he
looked
hard
at
him
to
see
if
he
was
in
earnest
and
then
looked
around
at
his
men
there
was
one
present
a
lieutenant
who
evidently
measured
dan
by
his
own
estimate
for
he
said
i
was
there
and
heard
all
about
it
captain
we
had
a
long
talk
with
the
old
s
your
father
s
name
he
added
bending
down
from
his
saddle
and
trying
to
get
a
glimpse
of
dan
s
face
his
name
is
newman
said
dan
and
yours
dan
and
this
is
my
brother
cale
newman
we
are
two
good
confederates
dyed
in
the
i
know
you
are
for
i
recognize
the
name
we
had
a
long
talk
with
newman
about
it
and
we
agreed
to
give
him
a
colonel
s
position
if
he
would
put
us
in
the
way
of
getting
the
chief
men
of
jones
county
into
our
hands
now
captain
you
can
afford
to
give
two
such
little
offices
as
he
wants
in
return
for
his
why
yes
of
course
said
the
captain
who
fell
in
at
once
with
his
lieutenant
s
ruse
you
see
want
all
of
you
men
hereafter
to
address
this
man
as
captain
and
his
brother
as
you
hear
he
added
turning
to
his
squad
and
a
responsive
yes
sir
came
from
all
the
men
although
candor
compels
us
to
say
that
some
of
them
wanted
to
laugh
some
of
them
looked
back
down
the
road
and
others
had
something
to
to
do
with
fixing
their
feet
in
their
stirrups
captain
said
dan
who
didn
t
know
whether
he
was
awake
or
dreaming
just
give
us
a
horse
apiece
and
a
gun
and
we
will
lead
you
against
those
men
any
cale
newman
scarcely
believed
he
had
heard
aright
he
knew
more
about
military
matters
than
his
brother
did
and
he
did
not
know
that
an
officer
had
a
right
to
promote
one
to
his
own
rank
without
going
first
through
some
preliminary
steps
he
listened
in
a
dazed
sort
of
way
to
the
conference
between
the
leader
of
the
squad
and
dan
but
as
no
one
spoke
to
him
and
addressed
him
as
lieutenant
he
did
not
know
whether
he
was
an
officer
or
not
at
any
rate
he
decided
to
get
home
before
he
built
any
hopes
upon
it
his
father
had
seen
some
military
although
where
he
saw
it
it
would
be
hard
to
tell
unless
he
had
seen
some
military
companies
march
along
the
street
and
he
would
know
whether
or
not
everything
was
just
as
it
should
be
you
see
captain
i
was
not
with
my
officers
when
they
talked
this
matter
over
with
your
father
and
consequently
i
didn
t
know
anything
about
it
said
the
leader
of
the
squad
however
i
am
glad
to
be
set
right
on
the
matter
you
spoke
of
surrendering
the
chief
men
into
our
hands
now
how
are
you
going
to
do
it
i
will
tell
you
where
you
can
get
one
of
them
right
here
said
dan
leon
sprague
has
gone
down
the
road
with
a
rebel
fellow
that
he
has
been
running
with
since
a
rebel
fellow
interrupted
the
captain
in
astonishment
have
any
of
our
men
deserted
to
you
oh
yes
there
s
lots
of
them
we
had
men
when
this
war
broke
out
replied
dan
copying
what
he
had
often
heard
his
father
say
and
now
we
have
a
thousand
fighting
men
camped
right
up
this
well
i
declare
said
the
captain
turning
to
his
lieutenant
we
came
within
an
ace
of
getting
right
in
the
midst
of
it
they
are
camping
right
up
this
road
you
say
yes
and
they
stole
a
big
lot
of
provisions
from
you
we
know
that
them
said
the
captain
we
have
come
up
here
to
see
about
those
provisions
do
you
know
where
they
are
the
most
of
them
have
been
hauled
to
the
there
said
the
lieutenant
then
it
is
of
no
use
to
go
any
further
if
those
goods
have
been
taken
to
the
swamp
they
are
lost
to
i
confess
it
does
look
that
way
now
about
this
rebel
fellow
who
has
just
gone
off
what
is
he
going
after
do
you
know
he
may
be
out
scouting
the
same
as
you
are
replied
dan
and
he
takes
a
couple
of
green
boys
to
help
him
scout
the
same
as
we
are
exclaimed
the
captain
i
guess
not
he
s
got
some
friends
down
here
and
he
wants
to
get
them
on
the
other
side
of
the
line
do
you
know
where
this
boy
lives
or
what
he
is
we
can
easy
catch
him
as
we
go
back
said
the
lieutenant
and
in
the
meantime
i
would
suggest
to
you
the
propriety
of
going
up
and
finding
out
for
ourselves
the
number
of
pickets
they
have
placed
at
the
bridge
i
believe
you
said
there
were
some
there
he
continued
turning
to
dan
there
s
a
whole
pile
of
them
answered
dan
we
didn
t
see
them
ourselves
because
we
swum
the
creek
but
when
we
got
over
here
i
went
out
to
see
if
i
could
see
anything
of
the
sentinels
and
they
saw
and
halted
but
you
didn
t
go
in
did
you
not
much
i
didn
t
i
took
leg
bail
and
got
into
the
woods
you
see
the
men
up
there
are
acquainted
with
us
and
if
they
got
us
they
would
make
us
stretch
another
quotation
from
his
father
well
we
shall
have
to
ask
you
to
stay
here
until
we
come
back
said
the
captain
we
shan
t
be
gone
but
a
little
while
forward
and
hold
your
sabres
in
so
that
they
won
t
hit
against
your
the
two
boys
stood
there
in
the
road
and
saw
them
ride
around
the
first
bend
and
they
went
so
silent
and
still
that
one
who
didn
t
know
they
were
there
would
not
have
suspected
anything
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
hearing
dan
showed
off
a
little
of
the
enthusiasm
that
was
in
him
captain
captain
dan
newman
said
he
with
a
violent
attempt
to
refrain
from
giving
a
wild
hurrah
and
i
never
was
in
the
army
in
my
life
and
you
are
a
lieutenant
cale
but
you
don
t
seem
to
think
much
of
the
fact
is
i
don
t
know
whether
i
am
an
officer
or
not
replied
cale
looking
down
at
the
ground
i
don
t
believe
that
officer
had
any
right
to
promote
well
i
declare
you
are
a
dunce
said
his
brother
more
than
half
inclined
to
get
angry
with
him
didn
t
you
hear
what
the
officer
said
to
his
i
want
you
all
to
address
him
as
captain
and
his
brother
as
lieutenant
tell
you
that
s
enough
for
but
this
officer
was
a
no
matter
for
and
i
don
t
believe
that
he
had
a
right
to
promote
you
to
the
same
rank
as
himself
they
don
t
do
business
like
that
in
jones
what
way
why
the
president
has
something
to
do
with
somebody
has
been
stuffing
you
of
course
they
don
t
do
business
that
way
in
jones
county
but
these
men
are
in
the
service
and
of
course
they
know
what
s
well
i
am
going
to
wait
until
i
see
father
and
if
he
tells
me
that
i
am
an
officer
why
i
ll
have
to
believe
this
was
a
new
thing
to
dan
and
he
did
not
say
any
more
he
supposed
that
the
next
thing
was
to
be
ordered
to
mobile
where
his
uniform
a
horse
and
weapons
would
be
given
him
and
after
that
he
would
be
at
liberty
to
take
command
of
a
body
of
scouts
the
same
as
this
captain
had
done
but
now
he
began
to
look
at
it
in
a
different
light
i
ll
tell
you
what
is
the
matter
with
you
said
cale
after
thinking
the
matter
over
it
all
comes
of
your
wanting
father
to
get
that
commission
as
hasn
t
he
got
a
right
to
it
i
d
like
to
know
retorted
dan
he
said
he
wouldn
t
work
for
any
i
know
but
they
didn
t
tell
him
that
they
would
give
him
that
commission
he
told
us
that
he
was
working
for
it
and
here
the
rebs
have
gone
and
got
on
your
blind
whoop
yelled
dan
his
anger
getting
the
start
of
him
and
with
the
word
he
kicked
out
savagely
at
his
brother
who
was
just
a
little
bit
too
quick
for
him
he
slipped
out
of
the
way
and
dan
s
momentum
took
him
around
on
one
foot
and
finally
seated
him
rather
roughly
on
the
ground
that
shows
that
you
don
t
believe
it
more
than
i
do
said
cale
heavens
and
earth
what
s
that
it
was
fortunate
that
something
happened
to
turn
dan
s
mind
from
all
thoughts
of
revenge
for
just
then
there
was
a
rapid
fusillade
of
carbines
heard
up
the
road
dan
picked
himself
up
and
before
he
could
answer
there
came
another
report
of
rifles
in
reply
to
the
first
and
they
were
so
accurately
aimed
that
some
of
the
bullets
passed
through
the
branches
above
their
heads
the
first
alarm
was
given
by
the
rebels
who
wanted
to
see
how
many
men
there
were
at
the
bridge
they
had
halted
a
little
ways
from
the
creek
leaving
two
men
to
hold
their
horses
and
crept
up
on
the
unconscious
sentinel
and
brought
him
bleeding
to
the
ground
a
moment
later
they
became
aware
that
the
pickets
at
the
bridge
were
too
strong
to
be
carried
by
the
small
force
they
had
at
their
command
for
the
answering
volleys
that
came
across
the
came
thick
and
fast
them
that
the
insurgents
of
jones
county
had
taken
ample
precautions
it
demonstrated
another
point
to
their
satisfaction
it
showed
them
that
they
knew
how
to
fight
they
are
shooting
at
us
cried
cale
who
straightway
dove
into
the
bushes
dan
stood
there
in
the
road
and
didn
t
know
what
to
do
while
he
was
considering
the
matter
the
firing
ceased
and
then
all
was
still
he
stood
there
for
a
long
time
half
an
hour
it
seemed
to
him
and
then
he
heard
the
sound
of
horses
hoofs
coming
from
the
direction
of
the
bridge
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
confederates
rode
up
did
you
hit
any
of
them
inquired
dan
we
hit
one
that
we
know
of
and
that
was
the
sentry
said
the
captain
we
filled
him
so
full
of
holes
that
he
never
will
hold
that
position
again
now
we
will
go
on
and
report
that
they
have
got
sentries
at
the
bridge
i
ll
look
into
all
the
houses
as
i
go
by
and
if
that
rebel
fellow
is
about
i
ll
have
him
well
now
look
here
said
dan
who
began
to
think
now
that
there
was
some
truth
in
what
his
brother
told
him
what
be
i
going
to
do
you
oh
yes
we
shall
want
you
to
stay
here
so
as
to
be
on
hand
you
know
the
next
time
we
come
out
after
the
yanks
you
will
be
right
here
when
we
want
you
no
i
live
all
of
twelve
miles
from
here
and
how
will
i
know
when
you
are
coming
couldn
t
you
take
me
on
to
mobile
with
you
why
of
what
use
would
you
be
there
answered
the
captain
speaking
before
he
thought
see
he
added
on
receiving
a
nudge
from
his
lieutenant
your
company
isn
t
ready
for
you
to
command
couldn
t
you
take
me
on
your
staff
well
you
see
i
don
t
have
a
staff
said
the
leader
struggling
hard
to
keep
from
laughing
outright
i
ll
speak
to
the
colonel
about
you
as
soon
as
i
get
back
forward
of
all
things
i
ever
heard
of
this
is
the
beat
thought
dan
as
he
stood
there
and
watched
the
men
out
of
sight
if
i
am
a
captain
i
do
not
see
what
s
the
reason
my
company
isn
t
ready
for
me
to
command
it
i
guess
i
have
made
a
botch
of
this
business
well
cale
he
added
aloud
let
s
catch
up
and
go
home
and
cale
i
won
t
say
anything
to
the
old
man
about
i
reckon
i
wouldn
t
if
i
was
in
your
place
said
cale
no
but
i
will
depend
upon
you
to
do
it
for
me
continued
dan
coaxingly
you
can
repeat
what
the
captain
said
to
us
without
mentioning
any
names
can
t
you
i
suppose
and
all
the
while
i
will
listen
and
be
as
earnest
as
you
for
disbelieving
it
said
dan
in
that
way
we
will
get
at
the
truth
of
the
matter
but
i
do
say
that
i
think
that
that
captain
was
up
to
mighty
mean
business
i
reckon
he
ll
find
somebody
else
that
he
wants
to
promote
in
the
same
way
and
i
wish
i
could
be
there
to
whisper
a
word
or
two
in
his
cale
followed
along
behind
his
brother
as
he
bent
his
steps
toward
home
swam
the
creek
and
just
at
daylight
arrived
within
sight
of
his
dilapidated
shelter
his
father
was
up
and
a
smoke
lazily
ascended
from
the
chimney
well
boys
what
luck
he
exclaimed
when
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
two
weary
tramps
coming
toward
him
did
you
see
any
rebels
dan
borrowed
his
father
s
plug
of
and
cale
hunted
up
his
pipe
before
either
of
them
replied
dan
cut
off
a
generous
chew
and
then
seated
himself
on
the
doorstep
you
have
been
gone
a
long
time
continued
newman
and
i
think
you
must
have
seen
something
did
you
capture
any
of
the
head
men
of
the
county
no
replied
dan
we
saw
some
confederates
but
they
wouldn
t
go
after
why
how
was
that
dan
began
and
told
his
story
just
as
it
happened
and
the
old
man
became
so
interested
that
he
allowed
his
pipe
to
go
out
he
told
about
his
meeting
with
the
confederates
described
the
conversation
they
had
with
them
all
except
the
promotion
told
about
the
firing
on
the
pickets
and
that
they
went
back
to
report
that
they
had
found
sentries
at
the
bridge
and
didn
t
they
charge
across
the
bridge
and
capture
those
pickets
exclaimed
newman
in
disgust
they
didn
t
make
nary
charge
that
we
heard
of
replied
dan
they
said
they
would
go
back
and
report
well
if
that
ain
t
a
pretty
way
to
do
business
i
don
t
want
a
cent
they
ought
to
have
a
couple
of
thousand
men
behind
them
then
they
could
have
captured
the
sentries
and
come
on
up
here
and
gobbled
these
it
was
now
cale
s
turn
to
try
his
hand
father
said
he
has
a
captain
any
right
to
promote
a
man
to
the
same
rank
as
himself
no
said
his
father
what
made
you
ask
that
question
oh
i
was
just
thinking
about
the
captain
has
a
right
to
watch
his
men
in
action
and
if
he
sees
them
doing
any
brave
act
he
reports
it
to
the
colonel
said
newman
but
he
has
no
authority
to
promote
them
the
boys
were
satisfied
cale
stretched
himself
out
upon
his
and
dropped
off
into
a
dreamless
slumber
while
dan
threw
out
his
tobacco
filled
a
pipe
with
and
sat
down
and
thought
about
it
there
was
one
thing
he
did
not
neglect
to
do
while
he
was
lost
in
dreaming
of
the
glory
that
might
have
been
his
if
his
promotion
had
been
according
to
law
he
did
not
forget
to
vow
vengeance
upon
the
captain
who
had
presumed
to
play
upon
his
credulity
in
that
outrageous
way
i
know
just
how
he
looks
soliloquized
dan
and
if
it
ever
comes
in
my
way
to
do
him
a
mean
act
he
ll
see
how
quick
i
ll
take
him
up
but
that
promotion
is
what
gets
me
how
fine
that
old
fellow
looked
in
his
boots
slouch
hat
and
gloves
that
came
up
to
his
elbows
never
mind
i
ll
see
the
day
when
i
will
be
better
off
than
any
of
meanwhile
there
was
one
soldier
in
the
captain
s
ranks
who
would
have
given
everything
he
possessed
to
have
been
able
to
have
pulled
out
his
revolver
and
shot
dan
down
when
he
talked
about
that
rebel
fellow
who
had
gone
off
with
a
couple
of
yanks
he
well
knew
what
had
brought
him
out
there
he
was
dawson
and
the
boy
who
had
escaped
at
the
time
the
was
captured
was
his
son
the
boy
had
lived
up
to
his
agreement
and
was
now
paving
the
way
to
take
his
mother
and
younger
brothers
inside
the
federal
lines
in
jones
county
we
have
said
that
dawson
came
out
and
spoke
to
the
two
men
who
had
come
into
the
yard
with
him
and
they
went
on
while
dawson
himself
came
toward
the
behind
which
he
knew
his
boy
was
concealed
he
was
after
a
saddle
for
his
own
together
with
his
horse
and
weapons
had
been
taken
by
the
jones
county
men
when
they
captured
the
train
he
had
seen
his
boy
go
off
into
the
bushes
and
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
for
he
knew
that
his
troubles
were
ended
he
obtained
the
saddle
placed
it
on
the
old
which
had
been
given
to
him
to
replace
the
horse
he
had
lost
and
rode
on
and
overtook
the
line
just
after
they
had
made
a
capture
of
cale
and
dan
newman
he
was
in
something
of
a
scrape
because
if
either
of
the
boys
saw
or
recognized
him
they
might
have
mistrusted
something
so
he
sat
there
on
his
mule
and
heard
what
dan
had
to
say
about
that
rebel
fellow
but
no
one
thought
of
connecting
him
with
it
they
supposed
that
young
dawson
was
somewhere
in
mobile
and
that
they
would
find
him
there
when
they
got
back
the
captain
went
into
all
the
houses
as
he
went
along
but
without
finding
any
preparations
for
hurried
departure
the
women
came
to
the
doors
as
fast
as
they
could
find
some
clothing
to
put
on
obediently
struck
a
light
in
response
to
the
captain
s
request
and
then
he
departed
with
a
slight
apology
for
his
intrusion
one
garrulous
old
woman
followed
him
to
the
door
and
inquired
what
did
think
you
wanted
to
find
anyway
i
just
wanted
to
see
if
any
of
your
men
folks
had
been
at
home
packing
up
goods
to
take
them
into
the
yankee
lines
said
the
captain
sho
my
men
folks
been
in
the
conf
drit
army
before
you
was
born
they
ain
t
seed
nuthing
to
make
em
desert
finally
they
reached
the
house
where
dawson
lived
and
he
noticed
one
thing
that
attracted
his
attention
at
once
there
was
but
a
single
dog
to
welcome
him
and
he
was
tied
up
back
of
the
house
all
the
others
had
gone
off
somewhere
as
the
lieutenant
reined
his
horse
up
close
to
the
pin
the
captain
turned
about
and
said
why
this
is
the
place
where
one
of
you
men
live
isn
t
it
you
came
in
here
after
a
saddle
didn
t
you
yes
sir
replied
a
voice
from
somewhere
in
the
line
your
boy
is
in
the
service
too
you
don
t
suppose
that
he
has
deserted
do
you
well
he
went
off
into
the
woods
and
i
haven
t
seen
him
since
you
can
go
in
and
see
for
yourself
seeing
is
believing
it
will
not
take
but
a
the
captain
dismounted
from
his
horse
and
pounded
loudly
upon
the
closed
door
but
met
with
no
response
then
he
pushed
open
the
door
and
entered
the
house
by
the
flickering
light
that
was
thrown
out
by
the
fire
that
was
blazing
on
the
hearth
the
lieutenant
found
a
candle
and
when
he
had
struck
a
light
a
scene
of
the
greatest
confusion
was
presented
the
bureau
drawers
were
all
thrown
every
which
way
and
when
they
made
their
way
to
the
not
a
vestige
of
clothing
was
there
on
the
bed
shouted
the
captain
here
s
where
one
of
those
fellows
has
been
arrest
that
man
out
one
riding
the
the
men
outside
began
riding
about
the
house
but
no
such
man
could
be
found
they
saw
the
place
where
the
solitary
hound
had
been
confined
but
he
was
gone
and
the
man
on
the
mule
had
disappeared
don
t
you
find
him
anywhere
shouted
the
captain
coming
out
of
the
door
in
great
excitement
no
sir
he
has
skipped
exclaimed
one
of
the
men
he
s
gone
off
this
way
shouted
another
i
hear
somebody
going
through
the
take
after
him
the
last
mother
s
son
of
you
commanded
the
captain
and
remember
and
don
t
come
back
without
him
i
tell
you
i
ll
get
fits
for
this
going
out
on
a
scout
and
letting
one
of
my
men
desert
under
my
very
eyes
in
an
instant
the
captain
and
all
his
men
were
in
hot
pursuit
of
the
horseman
whose
could
just
be
heard
the
chase
led
through
a
wide
with
a
high
fence
at
the
other
end
but
the
horseman
whoever
he
was
had
a
long
start
and
seemed
determined
to
make
the
most
of
it
toward
the
fence
he
held
the
men
scattering
out
so
as
to
head
him
off
when
he
got
there
and
finally
the
captain
who
rode
a
splendid
horse
got
near
enough
to
the
object
he
was
pursuing
to
see
that
it
was
a
mule
halt
he
shouted
we
ve
got
you
and
you
might
as
well
give
up
if
you
don
t
we
ll
leave
you
right
here
for
the
buzzards
to
eat
halt
i
still
there
was
no
response
and
the
mule
kept
on
as
fast
as
ever
the
captain
began
to
get
angry
and
he
drew
his
sabre
intending
to
cut
the
man
down
when
he
got
within
reach
of
him
but
just
then
they
came
within
reach
of
the
fence
and
the
mule
turned
and
ran
alongside
of
it
that
brought
him
within
reach
of
the
captain
s
vision
it
was
so
dark
that
they
couldn
t
see
the
man
on
the
mule
s
back
and
the
officer
after
taking
a
look
or
two
at
the
mule
drew
up
his
horse
he
shouted
making
use
of
his
favorite
expression
we
have
been
chasing
that
mule
but
where
s
the
man
on
her
the
mule
was
going
home
but
the
man
s
got
off
catch
him
men
and
then
we
ll
go
back
and
hunt
for
somebody
else
who
is
hidden
somewhere
in
the
the
captain
was
mortified
in
the
extreme
and
no
doubt
he
was
a
little
suspicious
at
any
rate
he
was
certain
that
he
heard
one
or
two
of
his
men
giggling
softly
to
themselves
the
idea
of
halting
a
mule
and
telling
him
that
if
he
didn
t
give
some
heed
to
it
he
would
leave
him
there
for
the
buzzards
to
eat
was
almost
too
much
for
them
chapter
xii
the
rebels
take
revenge
robert
whispered
a
voice
close
to
the
crack
where
the
chinking
had
fallen
out
is
that
you
for
goodness
sake
turn
that
revolver
the
other
way
leon
exclaimed
dawson
so
full
of
excitement
that
he
could
scarcely
speak
plainly

my
father

kill
him
i
am
gone
up
what
is
it
pap
you
got
away
didn
t
you
continued
the
voice
and
one
would
have
thought
there
was
a
slight
chuckle
mingled
with
it
and
you
have
come
here
to
take
your
mother
over
into
jones
you
re
right
i
have
returned
dawson
gleefully
and

yanks
here
with
me
and
they
are
just
as
good

i
thought

the
owner
of
that
name
i
am
here
and
ready
to
assist
him
in
any
way
i
i
am
glad
to
see
you
here
continued
dawson
for
i
shall
know
that
we
are
going
to
stand
some
now
father
what
shall
i
do
first
asked
dawson
who
was
impatient
to
get
to
work
hitch
the
first
two
mules
you
can
get
to
that
wagon
and
by
the
time
you
have
done
that
your
mother
will
be
ready
for
you
leave
one
dog
behind
you
so
that
i
can
readily
follow
your
why
are
you
not
going
to
stay
too
no
i
must
go
on
with
the
squad
and
run
my
risk
of
getting
away
afterward
replied
dawson
i
will
be
missed
if
i
don
t
go
with
them
and
i
want
you
and
your
mother
to
get
a
good
start
be
lively
and
work
as
hard
as
you
can
for
i
don
t
know
when
we
shall
be
what
shall
i
do
after
i
get
the
mules
hitched
up
asked
dawson
will
it
be
safe
for
me
to
drive
around
in
front
of
the
house
you
can
go
where
you
please
there
will
be
nobody
to
bother
you
keep
up
a
good
heart
till
i
the
man
went
off
to
get
his
saddle
which
hung
in
a
remote
corner
and
dawson
kept
a
close
watch
on
him
as
long
as
he
remained
in
the
crib
leon
couldn
t
help
thinking
how
coolly
father
and
son
went
about
escaping
from
serving
under
the
flag
they
didn
t
like
if
they
made
a
success
of
it
well
and
good
if
they
failed
it
was
certain
death
to
the
one
of
them
that
happened
to
be
caught
what
would
leon
s
own
mother
have
said
if
she
could
have
seen
him
at
that
moment
when
dawson
got
his
saddle
and
turned
to
go
out
he
waved
his
hand
toward
the
crack
as
a
farewell
signal
and
that
brought
the
first
long
breath
from
the
young
fellow
at
leon
s
side
it
was
plain
now
that
all
the
nonsense
was
gone
out
of
him
there
goes
the
best
father
that
any
fellow
ever
had
said
dawson
he
is
plucky
too
and
when
he
next
joins
us
he
won
t
come
so
still
he
ll
have
all
that
crowd
after
him
but
now
i
must
get
to
work
he
added
brightening
up
you
fellows
can
help
me
by
staying
right
here
and
watching
these
animals
so
that
they
won
t
arouse
the
whole
neighborhood
while
i
get
the
team
why
don
t
you
let
one
or
the
other
of
us
go
with
you
asked
leon
you
ll
only
be
in
the
way
and
besides
i
have
got
plenty
of
negroes
out
there
to
dawson
went
away
and
although
the
boys
who
were
watching
the
animals
caught
sight
of
him
once
in
a
while
through
the
cracks
it
was
fully
half
an
hour
before
he
came
back
then
he
had
the
team
which
an
old
negro
was
driving
and
the
wagon
was
loaded
so
full
that
there
did
not
seem
to
be
room
for
so
much
as
a
skillet
anywhere
about
it
safely
perched
among
the
was
his
mother
and
she
was
having
as
much
as
she
could
do
to
keep
the
children
quiet
on
the
in
front
was
cuff
who
was
talking
to
his
mules
in
a
quiet
sort
of
way
and
it
was
astonishing
how
much
speed
he
got
out
of
them
following
along
behind
the
wagon
were
ten
or
fifteen
negroes
who
wished
her
every
success
in
her
journey
and
promised
to
come
to
her
on
the
following
day
the
dogs
were
there
too
all
except
the
one
that
had
been
tied
behind
the
house
and
they
seemed
to
think
they
were
going
off
on
a
pleasure
trip
now
then
said
dawson
taking
his
bridle
from
leon
s
hand
and
mounting
his
horse
you
darkies
have
followed
us
far
enough
go
back
now
and
go
to
bed
and
remember
and
don
t
come
out
of
your
house
again
no
matter
how
much
noise
is
made
here
leave
that
dog
tied
up
father
wants
him
to
follow
our
trail
by
now
cuff
whip
up
we
don
t
want
to
stay
around
here
any
longer
mother
take
a
good
look
at
your
home
for
it
is
your
last
chance
to
see
no
robert
i
will
see
it
in
my
dreams
anyway
replied
his
mother
who
was
almost
at
the
idea
of
separating
herself
for
so
long
a
time
from
all
her
associations
if
your
father
only
comes
up
with
me
i
shall
be
what
do
you
think
of
that
leon
asked
dawson
as
the
wagon
passed
on
out
of
hearing
these
rebels
want
killing
father
brought
my
mother
to
that
house
when
he
first
married
her
and
we
have
lived
there
ever
since
i
am
going
to
shoot
every
rebel
that
comes
in
my
leon
did
not
know
what
reply
to
make
to
this
it
was
probable
that
his
own
mother
might
be
obliged
to
leave
her
home
in
the
same
way
and
he
didn
t
know
how
he
would
feel
if
she
were
turned
loose
in
the
world
it
was
no
wonder
he
thought
that
union
men
should
talk
of
killing
every
rebel
that
came
within
reach
he
knew
he
would
feel
so
too
there
is
one
thing
about
it
said
dawson
with
something
that
sounded
like
a
sigh
a
woman
has
more
pluck
than
a
man
to
stand
under
such
things
i
never
believed
so
until
the
road
they
intended
to
take
had
evidently
been
explained
to
cuff
before
they
started
for
he
took
to
the
lane
that
led
through
the
and
he
kept
his
mules
on
a
keen
trot
all
the
way
dawson
didn
t
go
so
fast
he
allowed
the
wagon
to
gradually
get
ahead
of
him
in
order
to
cover
their
retreat
and
of
course
the
boys
stayed
behind
with
him
when
they
arrived
at
the
cover
of
the
woods
cuff
turned
into
it
and
in
a
few
moments
more
was
out
of
sight
while
dawson
turned
his
horse
into
a
and
dismounted
now
we
will
wait
here
for
father
said
he
where
s
your
wagon
asked
leon
they
are
going
on
ahead
toward
the
bridge
taken
in
connection
with
those
pickets
i
saw
there
they
will
get
across
too
because
i
believe
they
would
turn
out
to
help
us
now
if
you
see
that
squad
coming
back
along
the
road
just
hold
your
breath
father
is
with
that
leon
had
never
known
what
excitement
was
before
he
tried
to
take
it
coolly
as
dawson
did
but
did
not
succeed
very
well
he
threw
the
bridle
off
his
horse
s
neck
and
placed
it
around
his
arm
leaned
on
the
top
rail
of
the
fence
and
kept
watch
of
the
road
and
all
the
while
he
kept
thinking
how
he
would
have
felt
if
his
father
had
been
with
that
squad
of
confederates
and
watching
for
a
chance
to
escape
tom
howe
took
it
philosophically
as
dawson
did
he
had
a
mother
to
worry
over
him
but
all
he
cared
for
was
the
successful
outcome
of
dawson
s
scheme
the
baying
of
the
lonely
hound
came
faintly
to
their
ears
but
with
the
exception
of
that
silence
reigned
unbroken
they
stood
leaning
on
the
fence
watching
first
the
house
and
then
allowing
their
eyes
to
roam
as
far
down
the
road
as
they
could
reach
and
finally
tom
broke
the
stillness
i
see
some
fellows
away
off
in
that
direction
said
he
pointing
with
his
finger
to
direct
the
attention
of
his
comrades
who
are
coming
along
this
way
there
s
a
whole
body
of
them
the
time
is
coming
said
dawson
after
he
had
taken
a
look
at
the
advancing
horsemen
we
ll
know
in
a
minute
what
s
going
to
after
that
all
was
still
again
the
three
boys
stood
there
in
the
and
watched
the
men
when
they
rode
into
the
yard
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
baying
of
the
hound
ceased
judging
from
the
distance
they
were
from
the
scene
there
was
a
fearful
commotion
in
the
house
men
were
seen
riding
rapidly
about
a
faint
voice
like
a
command
came
to
their
ears
and
the
squad
suddenly
vanished
from
view
father
has
the
start
of
them
at
last
exclaimed
dawson
so
excited
and
nervous
that
he
could
not
stand
still
why
how
do
you
make
that
out
asked
leon
you
must
have
an
owl
s
eyes
for
i
can
t
see
anything
from
neither
can
i
but
he
is
doing
just
what
i
would
have
done
if
i
had
been
in
his
place
you
don
t
hear
the
hound
any
longer
do
you
well
you
just
wait
until
father
comes
up
and
he
will
tell
you
that
the
men
are
chasing
a
riderless
leon
began
to
understand
the
matter
now
and
he
was
utterly
amazed
at
the
strategy
the
man
had
used
he
had
dismounted
from
his
given
him
a
tremendous
dig
from
some
weapon
or
other
he
had
in
his
hand
knowing
that
the
mule
would
go
home
before
he
would
go
anywhere
else
unloosed
the
dog
which
showed
him
the
way
down
the
lane
and
he
was
now
coming
that
way
with
the
speed
of
the
wind
his
pursuers
had
gone
on
after
the
mule
and
were
leaving
him
behind
every
moment
all
this
leon
went
over
for
the
benefit
of
tom
howe
and
dawson
simply
nodded
his
head
and
then
walked
out
in
the
lane
to
find
his
father
presently
he
saw
the
hound
which
sprang
upon
him
delighted
to
see
him
and
a
long
way
down
the
lane
behind
him
came
his
father
that
s
father
s
lope
and
i
know
it
said
dawson
addressing
himself
to
his
companions
he
ll
hold
that
for
two
hours
in
order
to
beat
a
deer
on
his
runway
but
i
am
going
to
show
him
that
i
am
a
good
soldier
who
comes
there
he
added
in
a
voice
pitched
just
loud
enough
to
reach
the
fugitive
s
ears
it
is
i
robert
came
the
joyful
response
and
in
a
few
seconds
dawson
came
up
by
george
i
have
had
a
good
race
for
it
he
went
on
pulling
his
hat
from
his
head
and
using
his
crooked
finger
to
remove
the
big
drops
of
perspiration
that
clung
there
now
let
us
see
what
those
are
going
to
do
with
the
you
ll
never
see
it
again
after
replied
dawson
father
this
is
leon
sprague
who
has
stuck
to
me
all
leon
i
am
glad
to
meet
you
said
dawson
extending
his
hand
if
you
wait
here
for
a
few
minutes
you
ll
see
what
you
are
going
to
come
to
the
rebels
are
making
up
an
organization
already
to
go
up
to
jones
county
and
clean
them
and
father
here
s
another
yank
that
we
must
not
forget
said
dawson
laying
his
hand
upon
tom
howe
s
shoulder
he
s
little
but
he
don
t
say
much
you
heard
about
the
boy
that
came
so
near
losing
his
life
during
the
last
drive
well
sir
he
s
the
man
and
there
is
the
one
who
saved
i
m
no
yank
returned
tom
indignantly
i
am
tom
howe
southern
born
the
same
as
yourself
but
i
hate
a
i
am
glad
to
know
you
tom
and
sometime
when
i
get
opportunity
i
am
going
to
shake
hands
with
you
you
see
the
reason
we
never
knew
you
before
is
because
you
kept
to
the
river
during
your
drives
and
never
came
back
into
the
country
at
all
said
dawson
turning
to
leon
now
we
will
wait
here
a
few
minutes
and
see
what
those
fellows
are
going
to
do
with
the
they
were
not
obliged
to
wait
very
long
for
the
squad
soon
returned
having
captured
the
mule
and
two
of
them
at
once
proceeded
to
ride
out
the
lane
in
which
the
fugitives
had
gone
they
came
on
until
they
got
within
fifty
yards
of
the
woods
and
there
they
stopped
i
declare
they
are
coming
on
in
pursuit
of
us
whispered
leon
drawing
one
of
his
revolvers
and
resting
it
upon
the
top
rail
of
the
fence
in
readiness
to
shoot
that
s
the
captain
and
the
lieutenant
said
dawson
they
re
not
coming
any
further
when
they
see
that
we
have
gone
into
the
woods
they
will
go
back
there
isn
t
a
man
in
that
squad
that
dare
trust
himself
within
reach
of
these
illustration
the
old
homestead
doomed
the
boys
stood
there
and
watched
the
two
at
the
bridle
of
his
horse
to
hold
his
head
down
and
tom
keeping
a
firm
hold
of
his
mule
s
finally
they
saw
one
of
them
alight
and
strike
a
match
by
the
aid
of
the
light
which
it
threw
out
they
examined
the
ground
and
easily
saw
the
but
they
didn
t
care
to
go
any
nearer
the
woods
they
held
a
short
consultation
after
which
they
turned
their
horses
and
rode
back
to
the
house
i
told
you
they
wouldn
t
come
any
further
said
dawson
if
i
was
in
command
of
that
squad
i
would
think
twice
before
i
would
put
my
men
in
danger
of
certain
death
by
bringing
them
in
dawson
leaned
upon
the
fence
again
and
devoted
himself
to
the
house
he
wanted
to
see
what
was
going
to
happen
to
his
property
before
he
went
away
he
had
not
held
this
position
for
more
than
five
minutes
before
his
heart
gave
a
violent
throb
and
then
he
became
satisfied
that
the
enemy
was
carrying
out
his
plan
of
setting
fire
to
the
house
he
saw
a
bright
light
on
the
inside
which
grew
brighter
every
moment
and
finally
the
flames
came
out
of
the
doors
and
windows
and
not
only
the
house
but
the
barns
the
and
the
negro
cabins
went
up
in
smoke
well
boys
i
have
seen
enough
said
dawson
turning
away
to
follow
up
the
wagons
the
rebels
have
one
enemy
now
that
they
never
had
before
which
way
did
your
mother
go
robert
yes
and
they
have
got
two
now
said
dawson
who
was
almost
ready
to
cry
when
he
saw
the
home
of
his
boyhood
going
up
in
flames
i
ll
shoot
every
rebel
that
comes
across
my
what
could
you
expect
in
war
times
said
his
father
of
course
i
looked
for
them
to
burn
my
i
should
do
the
same
if
i
were
on
their
side
but
there
s
one
thing
they
can
t
burn
and
that
is
the
ground
when
these
troubles
are
all
over
if
we
live
to
see
it
we
have
the
plain
land
with
which
to
start
over
but
what
have
they
done
with
our
black
ones
oh
they
have
gone
where
they
are
on
the
road
towards
mobile
before
this
well
i
ll
bet
you
they
don
t
keep
them
there
long
said
dawson
angrily
they
will
have
to
watch
them
all
the
time
or
they
ll
get
away
mother
went
out
this
way
you
see
it
wouldn
t
do
for
them
to
leave
the
darkies
with
us
said
dawson
pausing
for
a
few
moments
to
allow
the
boys
time
to
mount
their
animals
because
we
are
traitors
to
the
south
they
calculate
to
whip
us
and
when
the
war
is
ended
we
ll
have
to
get
but
they
ain
t
to
whip
us
said
dawson
the
fugitives
followed
along
the
had
been
cut
in
better
times
to
enable
the
planter
to
haul
out
the
a
mile
or
more
and
then
they
came
up
with
the
wagon
which
had
halted
for
them
to
come
up
they
had
been
within
sight
of
the
burning
house
all
the
while
and
the
mother
although
she
had
all
she
could
do
to
choke
back
her
tears
was
endeavoring
to
explain
the
matter
to
her
children
who
could
not
see
into
it
at
all
when
young
robert
appeared
in
sight
they
forthwith
assailed
him
with
questions
say
bobo
what
s
the
matter
said
the
elder
oh
some
men
wanted
to
burn
our
house
and
so
we
had
to
get
out
and
let
them
do
it
returned
dawson
go
on
cuff
said
dawson
and
all
he
did
was
to
reach
in
and
give
his
wife
a
cordial
grasp
of
the
hand
keep
right
in
this
road
until
you
strike
the
main
road
and
then
go
for
the
bridge
the
best
you
know
but
bobo
i
don
t
see
what
them
folks
should
want
to
burn
our
house
for
said
the
boy
we
ve
always
minded
our
own
wait
till
we
get
to
where
we
are
going
and
then
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
said
dawson
and
that
settled
the
question
of
burning
the
house
until
the
party
reached
ellisville
following
the
directions
of
his
master
the
negro
stuck
to
the
while
dawson
and
the
boys
stopped
in
a
to
reconnoiter
the
house
was
a
mile
away
but
it
threw
out
so
much
light
that
anything
that
happened
around
it
could
be
plainly
seen
they
saw
some
of
the
men
moving
about
and
when
everything
was
well
started
they
all
mounted
their
horses
and
disappeared
down
the
road
in
the
direction
of
mobile
but
they
had
an
old
soldier
to
contend
with
in
dawson
who
did
not
leave
his
for
an
hour
he
didn
t
know
but
some
of
the
men
would
come
back
and
so
get
between
him
and
the
bridge
and
cut
him
off
and
that
was
the
reason
he
waited
there
in
the
while
he
waited
there
he
talked
but
it
was
not
about
anything
connected
with
his
recent
misfortune
do
you
boys
happen
to
know
anything
about
dan
newman
said
he
yes
sir
we
know
him
replied
leon
with
a
smile
and
we
know
cale
well
what
sort
of
fellows
are
they
it
s
my
opinion
that
they
are
all
rebels
said
leon
with
emphasis
the
amount
of
it
was
that
the
old
man
expected
to
get
some
kind
of
a
position
and
when
he
didn
t
get
it
he
turned
against
that
s
just
what
i
supposed
said
dawson
robert
i
heard
all
about
you
before
i
ever
saw
you
who
told
you
asked
his
son
in
surprise
dan
newman
told
me
or
rather
he
told
it
to
the
captain
and
i
overheard
was
he
out
here
asked
leon
and
he
was
so
surprised
that
he
could
scarcely
believe
he
heard
aright
was
he
out
here
among
the
rebels
he
was
and
he
was
the
one
that
kept
the
squad
from
running
into
the
pickets
stationed
at
the
dawson
then
went
on
to
tell
what
he
knew
about
dan
and
before
he
got
fairly
started
he
had
two
surprised
and
angry
boys
for
listeners
when
he
told
how
that
rebel
fellow
had
ridden
on
before
them
in
company
with
leon
and
tom
and
that
he
could
easily
capture
them
if
they
would
only
wait
until
they
came
back
leon
took
off
his
hat
scratched
his
head
and
declared
if
that
fellow
is
at
home
when
we
get
there
i
am
going
to
have
him
arrested
i
don
t
see
why
the
fellow
didn
t
well
i
don
t
think
he
paid
much
attention
to
what
dan
had
to
say
replied
dawson
he
preferred
to
go
on
and
see
how
many
men
there
were
at
the
bridge
and
when
he
came
back
he
would
look
into
all
the
houses
and
see
if
there
had
been
any
evidences
of
hasty
departure
i
guess
he
didn
t
find
any
until
he
got
to
our
house
and
then
he
found
all
he
wanted
added
dawson
with
a
laugh
well
now
this
beats
me
said
leon
don
t
it
replied
tom
there
was
one
amusing
thing
that
was
connected
with
the
interview
said
dawson
and
that
was
dan
s
rapid
promotion
the
captain
made
him
a
captain
too
and
his
brother
a
why
had
the
captain
right
to
do
that
certainly
not
but
the
captain
saw
what
manner
of
man
he
was
and
so
promoted
him
on
the
spot
i
thought
i
had
better
tell
you
of
this
so
as
to
put
you
on
your
thank
you
and
you
may
be
sure
that
we
shall
take
advantage
of
it
captain
newman
how
that
sounds
as
for
tom
howe
he
was
almost
beside
himself
with
fury
when
leon
punched
him
in
the
ribs
and
asked
him
what
he
thought
about
it
he
simply
shook
his
head
and
said
nothing
after
awhile
he
inquired
was
cale
there
yes
cale
was
there
but
he
didn
t
have
much
to
no
matter
he
was
knowing
to
it
all
and
he
would
have
been
the
worst
one
in
the
lot
if
he
had
only
what
would
you
have
done
robert
asked
leon
of
his
rebel
friend
although
the
latter
hadn
t
made
any
remark
thus
far
what
would
i
have
done
if
they
had
laid
alongside
the
road
and
tried
to
capture
us
replied
dawson
and
there
was
much
more
determination
in
his
words
than
leon
had
ever
noticed
before
well
sir
i
wouldn
t
have
been
here
now
didn
t
you
hear
me
say
that
i
would
drop
before
i
would
be
captured
i
meant
every
word
of
it
if
i
should
be
taken
prisoner
i
would
only
be
hanged
and
i
would
rather
be
shot
than
well
boys
i
have
seen
enough
to
make
me
believe
that
the
rebels
have
gone
home
said
dawson
now
let
s
go
and
find
your
mother
and
see
how
much
luck
we
will
have
in
getting
by
the
oh
we
won
t
have
any
trouble
there
said
leon
i
ve
got
the
yes
but
it
won
t
be
of
any
use
to
you
in
broad
then
i
ll
make
my
face
pass
us
everybody
about
here
knows
leon
they
had
something
more
to
do
in
coming
up
with
the
wagon
for
cuff
when
he
struck
the
main
road
kept
on
the
best
he
knew
how
so
they
had
almost
reached
the
bridge
when
they
came
within
sight
of
his
span
of
mules
after
a
short
consultation
it
was
decided
that
leon
and
tom
should
go
on
ahead
to
smooth
the
way
for
the
fugitives
leaving
them
to
follow
with
the
team
so
they
galloped
their
horses
and
presently
heard
a
voice
ordering
them
to
halt
by
this
time
it
was
almost
sunrise
and
leon
profiting
by
the
experience
of
the
old
soldier
didn
t
say
he
had
the
countersign
he
and
tom
stopped
and
got
off
their
horses
well
i
declare
it
s
you
ain
t
it
said
the
one
who
came
out
to
see
who
and
what
they
were
did
you
see
anything
of
the
rebels
last
night
i
should
say
we
did
returned
leon
with
a
laugh
we
stood
right
by
and
saw
dawson
s
house
burn
was
that
before
they
fired
into
us
why
i
didn
t
hear
anything
about
that
did
they
shoot
into
you
yes
sir
and
they
killed
bach
noble
as
dead
as
a
hammer
you
see
he
was
standing
guard
when
they
crept
up
and
had
no
show
to
defend
himself
but
we
got
the
better
of
what
did
you
do
with
bach
we
laid
him
out
there
in
the
bushes
and
sent
a
man
up
to
ellisville
after
a
wagon
to
take
him
home
he
was
the
first
man
killed
on
our
side
but
i
ll
bet
he
ain
t
the
you
are
sergeant
of
this
post
are
you
not
i
reckon
that
s
what
they
call
i
want
you
to
pass
along
this
road
a
party
of
rebels
who
are
now
coming
toward
us
i
saw
their
houses
burned
last
night
they
are
mighty
tired
of
fighting
our
fellows
and
are
now
going
over
into
jones
county
to
battle
under
our
flag
and
i
will
tell
you
another
thing
about
them
they
won
t
take
any
prisoners
here
they
come
now
leon
i
reckon
you
ll
swear
by
them
i
will
any
day
in
the
week
ask
the
man
any
questions
you
want
to
they
have
got
children
with
them
and
they
wouldn
t
surely
take
them
into
an
enemy
s
the
dawson
party
approached
being
beckoned
to
by
leon
s
hand
and
young
robert
was
promptly
recognized
by
the
sergeant
in
charge
of
the
post
he
shook
him
warmly
by
the
hand
and
said
if
the
rest
of
the
family
were
as
strong
for
the
union
as
he
was
they
might
all
come
in
and
go
on
to
ellisville
they
are
as
strong
said
dawson
if
you
had
stood
where
my
father
stood
and
saw
your
property
burn
up
you
wouldn
t
have
much
love
in
you
for
the
party
passed
on
over
the
bridge
lingered
there
to
exchange
a
word
with
the
squad
on
guard
at
the
bridge
and
to
look
at
the
the
sentinel
had
left
when
he
fell
and
finally
kept
on
the
road
to
camp
chapter
xiii
cale
in
trouble
the
dawson
party
now
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
they
had
crossed
the
bridge
and
were
now
on
the
road
to
ellisville
the
pickets
were
between
them
and
their
pursuers
and
all
danger
of
capture
was
passed
young
robert
walked
along
beside
his
elder
dawson
seemed
determined
to
foot
it
and
his
son
kept
him
judging
from
the
remarks
exchanged
between
husband
and
wife
all
peril
of
being
made
prisoners
was
gone
even
cuff
drew
a
long
breath
and
slowed
up
on
his
mules
while
leon
and
tom
rode
on
ahead
apparently
very
much
occupied
with
their
own
thoughts
everybody
knew
what
they
were
thinking
about
and
for
a
long
time
no
one
troubled
them
but
at
last
dawson
could
stand
it
no
longer
it
s
rather
rough
on
you
ain
t
it
leon
said
he
to
see
where
that
sentinel
shed
his
blood
is
enough
to
make
you
believe
that
you
have
not
undertaken
a
i
tell
you
boys
you
have
taken
something
of
a
job
on
your
hands
said
dawson
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
and
i
am
afraid
before
the
thing
is
up
you
will
find
it
an
impossibility
the
sight
of
a
little
blood
don
t
worry
me
when
you
belong
to
a
company
that
charges
a
battery
and
the
battery
opens
on
you
and
kills
all
but
five
or
six
of
you
then
it
will
be
time
for
you
to
open
your
well
i
don
t
see
why
you
took
that
method
of
finding
out
how
many
men
there
were
at
the
bridge
said
leon
why
couldn
t
you
have
made
a
fuss
of
some
kind
out
there
in
the
bushes
and
then
counted
the
men
when
they
came
out
because
it
was
orders
said
dawson
if
you
were
in
the
rebel
army
for
a
few
short
weeks
you
would
know
what
that
means
i
fired
with
the
balance
but
i
shot
wild
i
never
fired
at
a
union
man
in
my
but
father
how
did
you
come
to
be
on
this
scout
asked
dawson
you
don
t
belong
to
that
oh
no
i
happened
to
be
present
when
the
squad
was
made
out
and
among
them
was
an
old
german
fellow
who
didn
t
care
to
go
and
i
borrowed
his
weapons
and
mule
and
went
in
his
place
i
expect
he
ll
get
tired
waiting
for
his
weapons
before
he
sees
them
again
that
s
a
pretty
good
carbine
added
dawson
holding
his
gun
off
at
arm
s
length
and
looking
at
it
i
didn
t
know
that
a
man
could
do
that
said
leon
i
thought
you
had
to
obey
orders
no
matter
whether
you
wanted
to
or
not
in
a
case
like
this
i
didn
t
say
anything
to
anybody
about
it
i
got
on
the
mule
and
when
the
squad
was
called
together
i
put
in
an
appearance
i
was
afraid
that
something
was
going
to
happen
to
my
family
and
i
couldn
t
bear
to
stay
i
tell
you
things
turned
out
all
right
didn
t
they
said
dawson
gleefully
you
came
home
just
in
the
right
time
to
join
what
i
want
to
know
is
am
i
going
to
get
my
horse
said
dawson
i
raised
him
myself
and
shouldn
t
like
to
part
with
you
will
get
your
horse
all
right
said
leon
if
he
has
been
given
to
anybody
that
man
will
have
to
give
him
that
settled
the
matter
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
the
dawson
family
leon
soon
began
to
get
over
the
forebodings
caused
by
that
crimson
stain
on
the
floor
of
the
bridge
and
riding
beside
the
wagon
he
kept
up
a
conversation
with
dawson
who
told
him
many
things
connected
with
the
service
that
he
hadn
t
dreamed
of
in
due
time
they
arrived
at
ellisville
just
as
they
were
going
up
the
main
road
that
led
past
the
hotel
they
met
a
squad
of
sentinels
going
down
to
relieve
those
at
the
bridge
it
was
plain
that
an
old
soldier
was
in
command
of
them
for
they
were
closed
up
held
their
guns
at
a
carry
and
marched
by
twos
the
two
officers
who
commanded
them
marched
at
the
head
they
had
evidently
had
some
time
to
drill
their
men
and
the
result
showed
that
the
backwoodsmen
were
not
at
all
behind
in
military
matters
when
they
came
up
they
reined
their
horses
out
of
the
way
and
passed
on
without
speaking
there
s
a
squad
that
is
well
drilled
said
dawson
but
i
do
not
see
why
you
do
not
destroy
that
bridge
it
seems
to
be
a
world
of
trouble
to
there
s
a
very
good
reason
why
we
don
t
destroy
it
said
leon
there
are
five
other
places
where
it
can
be
why
i
hadn
t
heard
of
that
exclaimed
dawson
do
you
remember
sending
two
men
up
here
to
make
a
map
of
the
country
asked
leon
well
they
found
it
and
did
you
let
those
men
go
back
no
one
of
them
stayed
up
here
said
leon
who
somehow
could
not
find
it
in
his
heart
to
say
the
man
had
been
killed
if
we
destroy
the
bridge
anybody
like
you
who
is
tired
of
serving
under
that
old
rag
won
t
know
that
they
can
get
across
and
we
have
nobody
to
send
them
to
show
where
the
fords
are
we
don
t
know
as
they
drew
near
to
the
porch
of
the
hotel
leon
saw
his
father
standing
there
he
dismounted
and
shook
him
by
the
was
certain
that
his
father
put
a
little
more
grip
into
the
shake
than
presented
dawson
who
it
is
not
necessary
to
say
was
received
with
a
hearty
welcome
the
first
thing
this
man
wants
is
his
horse
said
leon
was
he
with
us
when
we
captured
that
asked
sprague
if
so
he
can
have
his
horse
they
have
not
been
given
out
there
sir
you
got
your
horse
added
leon
turning
to
dawson
now
the
next
thing
is
we
want
to
report
is
the
president
in
his
room
then
father
i
want
you
to
come
up
there
with
dawson
he
s
got
some
things
to
tell
you
that
will
astonish
his
father
replied
that
he
didn
t
see
how
he
was
going
to
be
astonished
any
more
than
he
had
been
but
followed
leon
up
the
stairs
to
the
president
s
office
they
found
the
gentleman
there
just
as
they
had
seen
him
before
with
a
pair
of
blue
jean
pants
on
which
were
tucked
in
heavy
cowhide
boots
and
no
coat
on
he
greeted
dawson
very
cordially
and
inquired
in
his
hearty
way
so
you
ve
got
tired
of
serving
under
a
flag
that
you
don
t
like
and
have
come
over
here
to
cast
your
lot
with
us
well
sir
the
best
we
have
got
is
i
am
well
aware
of
that
president
said
dawson
but
there
is
one
thing
that
i
want
to
post
you
on
at
once
it
is
about
that
man
dan
knight
removed
the
pen
from
behind
his
ear
and
settled
back
in
his
chair
he
had
been
expecting
to
hear
something
from
dan
newman
for
a
long
time
dawson
began
and
told
him
the
whole
story
of
dan
s
meeting
with
the
confederates
his
sudden
promotion
and
all
about
it
and
when
he
got
done
there
was
an
expression
on
the
president
s
face
that
few
people
had
seen
there
well
dawson
you
can
go
down
there
and
pick
out
any
place
you
can
find
to
draw
your
wagon
up
said
he
you
are
right
at
home
here
sprague
what
is
your
opinion
regarding
dan
newman
my
opinion
is
that
he
ought
to
be
arrested
at
once
replied
sprague
and
after
that
are
you
going
to
try
him
by
a
that
will
be
just
as
the
men
say
if
he
is
not
tried
by
he
will
be
shipped
off
among
his
friends
they
can
promote
him
faster
than
we
can
said
sprague
with
a
smile
well
get
to
work
at
once
take
as
many
men
as
can
surround
newman
s
old
shanty
and
make
prisoners
of
those
boys
if
the
old
man
says
too
much
bring
him
along
too
dawson
i
shall
send
for
you
very
good
sir
i
will
be
on
hand
when
i
am
sprague
lost
no
time
in
getting
his
men
together
and
while
he
was
hunting
them
up
dawson
held
a
short
interview
with
his
father
now
you
take
my
horse
said
he
and
when
we
get
back
we
ll
get
your
nag
of
course
leon
is
going
to
arrest
newman
and
i
am
going
with
him
turn
into
any
open
place
you
can
find
in
the
grove
and
there
make
your
camp
you
will
find
them
all
friendly
dawson
mounted
the
horse
and
led
the
wagon
down
the
road
and
just
then
bud
mccoy
came
up
bud
was
always
on
hand
when
he
was
wanted
he
got
so
in
the
habit
of
staying
close
around
to
sprague
that
it
was
not
long
before
the
men
came
to
call
him
colonel
sprague
s
but
bud
didn
t
mind
that
he
said
he
got
more
to
do
by
being
around
there
than
he
could
anywhere
else
and
that
was
what
a
union
volunteer
wanted
in
times
like
these
what
s
up
he
exclaimed
what
does
the
old
man
want
with
volunteers
he
is
going
out
to
arrest
dan
newman
said
leon
well
there
i
always
thought
that
man
ought
to
be
arrested
said
bud
he
has
been
preaching
up
secession
docterings
till
you
can
t
rest
what
s
he
been
doing
now
it
did
not
take
long
for
leon
to
make
bud
understand
the
matter
and
as
he
went
on
to
tell
what
dan
had
been
guilty
of
the
scowl
on
the
man
s
face
changed
to
one
of
furious
hatred
when
leon
ceased
he
struck
his
fist
into
his
open
palm
with
a
ringing
slap
you
ll
go
too
won
t
you
of
course
i
ll
go
i
ain
t
to
stand
no
fooling
like
that
he
has
said
enough
to
hang
him
higher
n
while
they
were
talking
sprague
was
seen
coming
at
the
head
of
five
men
whom
he
had
summoned
to
make
the
arrest
we
said
he
had
summoned
five
men
but
the
news
of
what
he
wanted
to
do
had
gradually
worked
its
way
through
the
camp
until
there
were
more
than
twenty
men
who
were
slinging
on
their
and
hurrying
to
catch
up
with
those
who
had
been
summoned
the
feeling
was
so
great
against
newman
that
all
hands
wanted
to
have
a
finger
in
his
arrest
as
he
passed
by
the
porch
of
the
hotel
leon
tom
and
dawson
joined
him
there
s
one
thing
about
it
said
leon
looking
back
at
the
stalwart
fellows
behind
him
no
newman
can
get
away
from
this
you
re
mighty
right
said
one
of
the
men
it
s
a
wonder
to
me
that
your
father
didn
t
arrest
him
long
see
here
boys
said
sprague
from
the
head
of
the
column
be
quiet
and
still
those
newmans
are
like
quails
they
ll
run
and
hide
if
they
hear
a
twig
snap
when
we
come
up
with
the
house
i
ll
give
the
word
and
then
you
know
what
to
illustration
the
newmans
in
trouble
silently
the
men
fell
in
behind
their
leader
and
swiftly
did
they
work
their
way
toward
the
shanty
it
was
probably
half
a
mile
to
where
it
was
located
and
although
everybody
moved
so
cautiously
that
they
were
certain
not
a
twig
snapped
they
were
not
careful
enough
to
conceal
their
presence
from
the
man
they
were
going
to
arrest
at
length
when
sprague
dashed
aside
the
thicket
and
stepped
out
into
the
little
space
that
surrounded
the
cabin
they
saw
newman
and
his
wife
at
the
door
the
former
held
in
his
hand
an
axe
and
the
other
had
a
skillet
which
she
flourished
to
and
fro
as
the
men
approached
what
do
you
want
here
exclaimed
newman
and
he
lifted
his
axe
threateningly
in
his
hand
surround
the
house
boys
said
sprague
we
ll
talk
to
you
in
a
the
most
of
the
men
were
prompt
to
act
upon
this
suggestion
and
no
sooner
had
bud
mccoy
who
was
leading
one
squad
appeared
behind
the
house
than
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
cale
newman
in
the
act
of
leaving
it
through
the
window
ah
here
you
are
my
fine
lad
said
bud
seizing
him
by
the
arm
where
s
that
brother
of
yours
oh
now
what
are
you
going
to
arrest
me
for
exclaimed
cale
who
turned
white
and
trembled
in
every
limb
i
ain
t
done
nothing
father
do
you
see
what
they
are
doing
we
hain
t
done
you
no
harm
yet
but
just
wait
until
we
get
bud
had
been
on
the
point
of
looking
in
at
the
window
to
see
if
he
could
discover
anything
of
dan
when
to
his
surprise
there
came
something
down
on
his
head
which
knocked
the
hat
over
his
eyes
and
narrowly
escaped
laying
him
out
flat
it
was
the
skillet
in
the
hands
of
the
old
woman
but
bud
didn
t
wait
to
see
what
it
was
he
straightened
himself
up
by
the
side
of
the
house
and
when
the
skillet
descended
a
second
time
he
caught
it
in
his
hand
and
came
within
an
ace
of
jerking
the
woman
through
the
window
he
wrested
the
novel
weapon
from
her
and
threw
it
as
far
as
possible
into
the
bushes
say
old
woman
you
want
to
keep
your
distance
said
bud
who
was
so
angry
that
he
could
scarcely
talk
straight
you
try
that
again
and
i
ll
have
you
through
that
window
by
this
time
the
men
from
the
front
part
of
the
house
had
entered
through
the
man
with
his
axe
didn
t
make
half
the
battle
his
wife
no
dan
was
there
to
be
seen
you
will
remember
that
when
he
came
back
he
sat
down
with
his
pipe
to
smoke
and
think
over
the
perfidy
of
the
captain
in
giving
him
promotion
when
he
had
no
business
to
do
it
and
that
he
had
not
yet
gone
to
bed
while
smoking
he
was
startled
by
a
noise
in
the
bushes
he
listened
but
the
noise
increased
and
grew
louder
and
in
an
instant
it
flashed
upon
him
that
his
interview
with
the
rebel
captain
was
known
that
was
enough
to
start
him
into
the
bushes
giving
his
father
a
sign
to
call
cale
he
was
out
of
sight
in
a
moment
and
all
efforts
to
find
him
were
useless
here
s
one
of
them
colonel
said
bud
coming
around
the
house
now
where
s
the
other
the
man
had
been
disarmed
of
his
axe
and
the
woman
didn
t
seem
to
have
any
more
fight
left
in
her
the
powerful
jerk
she
got
from
bud
satisfying
her
that
the
best
thing
she
could
do
was
to
keep
quiet
but
they
had
plenty
of
talk
left
in
them
of
all
the
mean
things
that
i
ever
saw
this
is
the
beat
said
newman
as
she
gazed
around
at
the
number
of
men
that
had
come
there
to
take
her
boy
into
custody
it
is
an
outrage
chimed
in
newman
stamping
about
over
the
floor
as
if
he
were
almost
beside
himself
they
come
with
an
army
of
men
to
take
away
one
little
fellow
i
hope
you
feel
duly
ashamed
of
let
go
my
coat
exclaimed
cale
to
the
man
who
held
him
tight
by
his
collar
to
see
that
he
did
not
escape
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
me
we
ll
put
you
in
jail
that
s
what
we
ll
do
with
you
said
the
man
you
have
preached
up
secession
long
say
father
are
you
going
to
let
that
old
jail
stand
demanded
cale
trying
hard
to
escape
from
the
grip
that
held
him
you
said
that
you
would
cut
it
down
if
they
took
any
of
us
where
s
your
brother
demanded
bud
he
s
gone
where
you
won
t
find
him
retorted
newman
now
i
want
you
to
turn
my
boy
we
have
had
enough
out
of
you
said
sprague
who
had
looked
all
around
in
the
hope
of
finding
dan
hidden
somewhere
in
the
house
if
you
say
another
word
i
ll
take
you
along
to
keep
cale
company
you
two
stay
here
and
watch
the
cabin
one
in
front
and
one
at
the
back
he
added
pointing
out
two
of
the
men
he
wished
to
obey
his
orders
don
t
let
newman
and
his
wife
go
out
of
doors
and
if
dan
comes
back
here
gobble
him
up
i
will
relieve
you
in
a
couple
of
hours
forward
the
rest
of
taking
cale
along
the
narrow
path
that
led
through
the
woods
was
as
much
as
two
men
wanted
to
do
he
kicked
and
struggled
so
furiously
as
long
as
he
remained
within
reach
of
his
father
he
constantly
appealed
to
his
father
to
cut
down
the
jail
so
that
he
could
not
be
confined
there
and
it
was
only
when
sprague
threatened
him
with
the
gag
that
he
condescended
to
keep
still
they
hustled
him
along
the
half
a
mile
that
led
to
ellisville
and
when
they
arrived
within
sight
of
the
grove
they
found
all
the
men
there
to
see
how
they
had
come
out
cale
must
have
listened
to
some
things
that
astonished
him
for
he
heard
one
man
say
that
hanging
was
too
good
for
such
as
he
was
and
advocated
that
he
be
tied
to
a
tree
and
left
there
he
was
marched
through
the
crowd
of
men
some
of
whom
shook
their
fists
in
his
face
and
up
the
stairs
that
led
to
the
president
s
office
then
the
men
let
go
of
his
collar
and
in
an
instant
every
inch
of
was
filled
there
wasn
t
the
least
chance
for
escape
well
cale
newman
said
the
president
taking
off
his
spectacles
and
settling
back
in
his
chair
you
tried
to
get
those
confederates
last
night
to
go
after
our
i
never
began
cale
i
am
not
here
to
argue
the
matter
with
you
i
am
here
to
tell
you
what
you
have
done
said
knight
they
offered
you
promotion
in
case
you
would
do
something
for
well
i
ll
tell
you
how
it
was
said
cale
who
didn
t
think
that
he
was
betraying
his
brother
by
the
confession
he
was
about
to
make
the
captain
offered
to
make
me
lieutenant
but
i
didn
t
think
he
had
any
right
to
do
ah
said
the
president
yes
and
my
brother
he
offered
to
make
captain
dan
was
in
for
it
but
i
was
a
little
jubius
he
offered
to
show
them
where
leon
and
that
rebel
fellow
was
but
the
captain
said
he
would
go
on
and
see
how
many
men
they
were
at
the
and
that
was
the
time
they
killed
bach
noble
said
knight
with
suppressed
fury
well
it
was
all
in
war
times
wasn
t
it
war
times
what
do
you
mean
by
that
ejaculated
the
president
while
a
restless
movement
among
the
men
told
that
they
did
not
uphold
anybody
in
thus
taking
the
life
of
a
sentry
bach
noble
was
one
of
the
most
popular
lumbermen
in
the
county
and
this
method
of
shooting
him
just
because
it
was
war
times
aroused
all
the
anger
there
was
in
them
a
word
from
the
president
would
have
seen
cale
swung
up
to
a
tree
in
less
than
no
time
it
was
war
times
wasn
t
it
inquired
cale
who
seemed
to
think
he
had
said
too
much
we
ll
not
discuss
that
the
confederate
captain
offered
you
and
your
brother
promotion
then
what
by
a
little
questioning
knight
got
at
all
that
had
transpired
during
their
interview
with
the
confederate
captain
and
the
old
soldiers
that
were
in
there
were
amazed
when
they
saw
how
green
dan
was
after
thinking
a
moment
he
said
i
don
t
think
that
cale
has
been
guilty
of
treason
what
do
you
men
say
to
that
no
said
a
voice
but
he
has
been
giving
out
docterings
that
won
t
go
down
with
this
that
s
so
chimed
in
others
i
acknowledge
that
said
knight
but
i
say
let
s
shut
him
up
and
keep
him
until
we
can
catch
his
brother
he
can
t
be
far
i
noticed
that
some
of
my
men
went
into
the
bushes
to
find
him
said
sprague
some
of
them
haven
t
returned
very
well
we
ll
shut
cale
up
until
we
find
that
slippery
brother
and
then
we
ll
examine
them
both
we
ll
find
a
room
somewhere
in
the
see
bass
kennedy
has
got
his
corn
in
the
jail
and
it
would
be
hardly
worth
while
to
take
it
out
for
the
sake
of
one
eph

will
keep
watch
of

said
cale
not
daring
to
venture
upon
the
man
s
surname
again
like
everybody
else
in
the
county
he
had
learned
to
call
a
man
by
his
name
without
any
fixture
to
it
and
he
did
not
care
to
begin
now
his
father
had
always
spoken
of
him
as
knight
and
cale
thought
he
was
as
good
as
the
president

knight
with
a
look
of
surprise

no
further
business
before
the
meeting
it
stands
eph
at
once
seized
his
prisoner
and
hurried
him
before
the
proprietor
of
the
hotel
who
at
once
hit
upon
a
room
that
would
do
for
his
confinement
we
ll
put
him
high
up
so
that
he
can
t
get

said
he
we

up
in
the
third
story
come
taking
a
key
from
behind
his
desk
the
proprietor
led
the
way
up
the
stairs
until
he
came
to
a
small
room
with
only
one
window
in
it
pushed
open
the
door
and
stood
aside
so
that
cale
could
enter
there
was
literally
no
furniture
in
the
room
it
all
having
been
removed
so
that
it
could
be
ready
to
be
moved
whenever
faulkner
got
ready
to
go
to
the
swamp
now

exclaimed
faulkner
opening
his
eyes
in
surprise
is
that
what

to

of
him
well
it
s
a
mighty
hard
death
for
a
young
man
to

said
cale
almost
ready
to
cry
again
if

said
eph
with
a
sneer
well

said
eph
he

faulkner
was
gone
not
more
than
two
minutes
and
came
back
with
a
chair
which
was
pushed
into
the
room
and
then
the
jailer
locked
the
door
and
put
the
key
into
his
pocket
cale
took
a
look
around
his
prison
and
then
walked
to
the
window
and
took
a
good
look
there
too
it
wasn
t
a
great
ways
to
the
ground
and
cale
was
certain
if
his
enemies
did
not
put
a
sentry
there
to
see
that
he
did
not
drop
down
and
take
himself
safe
off
his
escape
would
be
an
assured
thing
he
tried
the
window
and
was
gratified
to
find
that
it
yielded
to
his
touch
then
he
walked
back
to
the
chair
and
seated
himself
upon
it
those
union
men
is
mighty
smart
he
soliloquized
because
i

three
stories

show
them
how
easy
it
will
be
for

my
hands
and
drop
down
and
they
talk
about
hanging
me
i
ll
bet
they
can
t
do
the
muffled
tread
of
the
sentry
came
to
his
ears
and
finally
when
the
clock
struck
eph
opened
the
door
to
see

that
s
a
good
way
to
put
in
one
s
cale
did
not
answer
he
sat
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
his
head
bowed
upon
his
hands
and
he
was
thinking
of
how
he
could
escape
being
hanged
but
of
where
he
should
go
and
what
he
should
do
in
case
he
made
the
attempt
at
escape
successful
he
had
heard
sprague
when
he
placed
sentinels
over
his
house
one
in
front
and
another
heard
him
tell
them
not
to
let
his
father
or
mother
go
out
of
the
he
knew
it
would
be
foolhardy
to
go
home
after
that
the
sentries
would
capture
him
and
bring
him
back
to
his
prison
eph
took
an
unbounded
delight
in
bothering
the
boy
he
knew
that
the
most
that
would
be
done
with
cale
would
be
to
ship
him
off
among
his
friends
and
that
would
be
the
last
of
him
he
glanced
at
the
window
to
see
that
it
was
all
right
and
then
went
out
closing
the
door
behind
him
that
fellow
keeps
telling
me
that
i
am
going
to
be
hung
said
cale
raising
his
head
and
glancing
at
the
door
through
which
eph
had
just
gone
out
what
would
i
give
to
be
in
here
at
night
when
he
comes
in
and
finds
the
window
open
and
cale
newman
gone
i
tell
you
that
would
be
worth
some
money
now
if
i
could
only
find
dan
he
would
know
where
to
go
and
what
to
for
long
hours
cale
sat
there
and
listened
to
the
tread
of
the
sentinel
and
every
time
the
clock
struck
he
lifted
his
head
and
looked
at
the
sentinel
who
opened
the
door
and
looked
in
they
were
changed
every
two
hours
and
finally
it
began
to
grow
dark
by
that
time
cale
began
to
grow
hungry
and
while
he
was
thinking
about
it
the
door
opened
and
in
came
faulkner
whose
hands
were
filled
with
bedclothes
and
eatables
i
can
t
bear
to
have
any
man
around
me
who
i
know
is
hungry
even
if
he
is
going
to
be
hung
said
he
let
me
put
this
bread
and
meat
on
the
chair
there
s
something
for
you
to
lie
down
on
it
s
pretty
rough
i
know
but
i
expect
you
get
rougher
at
home
and
pleasant
cale
examined
the
bedclothes
as
well
as
he
could
in
the
dark
and
found
that
he
had
a
pillow
and
what
was
better
than
all
two
quilts
which
he
could
tear
up
fasten
to
the
chair
and
thus
let
himself
down
from
the
window
he
chuckled
to
himself
and
devoted
his
attention
to
the
viands
by
the
time
he
had
got
through
the
sentry
opened
the
door
and
cale
saw
a
light
streaming
in
oh
i
m
here
yet
said
cale
i
know
you
are
said
the
man
and
you
re
going
to
stay
there
until
you
come
out
to
be
all
right
but
you
won
t
hang
me
until
you
catch
my
brother
he
had
the
most
to
do
with
talking
with
that
no
matter
you
was
knowing
to
it
all
and
that
counts
for
a
heap
against
the
sentry
closed
the
door
and
in
an
instant
cale
was
on
his
feet
things
had
to
be
done
in
a
hurry
and
quietly
too
for
in
an
hour
more
the
man
would
look
in
to
see
if
his
prisoner
was
all
right
it
was
something
of
a
job
to
tear
the
quilts
but
fortunately
he
had
them
all
done
at
last
and
when
he
knotted
them
together
he
was
glad
to
see
how
long
they
were
he
didn
t
think
he
would
be
obliged
to
drop
more
than
ten
feet
the
next
thing
was
opening
the
window
and
fastening
the
quilts
to
the
chair
but
he
accomplished
it
without
alarming
the
sentinel
and
drawing
in
a
long
breath
he
launched
himself
over
the
side
of
the
window
and
heard
the
chair
bang
loudly
as
he
threw
his
weight
upon
the
quilts
in
his
haste
the
quilts
did
not
do
much
toward
assisting
him
to
the
bottom
for
he
slid
rapidly
down
them
and
landed
all
in
a
heap
under
the
window
just
as
the
sentry
opened
the
door
to
see
what
was
going
on
are
you
there
yet
cale
asked
the
man
as
he
looked
all
around
the
room
by
gracious
he
has
gone
with
two
jumps
the
man
reached
the
window
and
leaned
over
and
looked
out
everything
was
concealed
by
darkness
and
even
the
crouching
cale
who
was
close
to
the
wall
right
under
the
man
s
gaze
escaped
his
notice
then
the
man
thought
of
his
rifle
he
rushed
back
into
the
hall
and
got
it
fired
it
once
out
of
the
window
and
then
went
to
tell
the
men
what
an
extraordinary
escape
cale
had
made
this
was
the
time
for
the
prisoner
to
make
the
most
of
his
opportunity
he
arose
to
his
feet
and
made
good
time
across
the
narrow
that
lay
between
him
and
the
woods
and
he
never
ceased
running
until
he
reached
the
banks
of
a
little
bayou
a
mile
back
in
the
forest
where
he
stopped
and
sat
down
to
rest
there
sir
said
cale
wiping
the
big
drops
of
perspiration
from
his
forehead
i
ve
done
it
as
sure
as
the
world
i
have
done
it
that
is
the
first
time
i
ever
was
put
in
jail
for
something
i
didn
t
do
let
them
get
somebody
else
and
talk
about
hanging
them
now
if
i
could
only
find
cale
did
not
take
very
long
to
rest
himself
before
he
got
upon
his
feet
again
and
cautiously
worked
his
way
toward
his
father
s
shanty
the
darkness
had
no
effect
upon
cale
for
he
took
his
course
as
straight
as
he
could
have
done
in
the
daytime
the
sentries
might
have
been
removed
by
this
time
but
all
the
same
he
made
his
way
stealthily
through
the
bushes
as
though
the
sentries
were
there
and
liable
at
any
minute
to
jump
out
and
make
a
prisoner
of
him
it
would
never
do
to
be
captured
again
for
the
next
time
he
would
be
put
where
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
get
away
but
he
walked
right
onto
dan
who
had
been
up
to
the
house
for
the
same
purpose
that
is
he
wanted
to
see
if
there
was
any
chance
for
him
to
communicate
with
his
father
as
cale
was
working
his
way
cautiously
through
the
bushes
going
so
still
that
he
could
not
hear
the
thicket
rattle
behind
him
he
was
startled
out
of
a
year
s
growth
by
hearing
a
voice
close
at
his
side
mutter
i
ll
be
if
there
ain
t
cale
is
that
you
stammered
cale
so
overjoyed
that
he
could
scarcely
speak
you
re
right
it
s
me
said
dan
where
you
been
they
had
me
shut
up
in
jail
was
the
answer
in
the
calaboose
no
in
the
hotel
and
they
left
one
window
there
without
any
sentry
to
guard
it
and
i
just
come
well
sir
i
will
say
hereafter
that
you
ve
got
pluck
but
come
up
here
i
ve
got
something
to
show
cale
began
feeling
his
way
toward
the
place
where
dan
was
and
in
a
few
moments
he
placed
his
hand
upon
his
shoulder
but
there
was
something
else
that
he
touched
there
it
was
a
revolver
why
dan
where
have
you
been
to
get
that
asked
cale
in
surprise
i
have
not
only
got
that
but
the
man
what
owns
it
returned
dan
with
the
same
pride
he
would
have
exhibited
had
he
won
an
enemy
s
colors
in
battle
i
ve
got
leon
cale
was
so
astonished
that
he
couldn
t
say
anything
just
then
while
you
have
been
shut
up
in
jail
i
have
been
working
for
the
glorious
cause
said
dan
i
got
him
just
as
easy
as
falling
off
a
log
i
ve
heard
so
much
tell
about
leon
s
courage
that
i
was
kinder
afraid
to
tackle
him
but
pshaw
i
handled
him
as
easy
as
you
would
handle
a
let
us
now
go
back
for
a
moment
and
tell
what
had
happened
to
dan
while
cale
was
being
shut
up
in
the
hotel
when
he
came
back
from
holding
his
interview
with
the
confederate
captain
he
did
not
go
to
bed
as
cale
did
but
filled
his
pipe
with
and
lay
down
on
the
ground
to
smoke
and
think
he
lay
there
for
an
didn
t
want
any
breakfast
besides
he
was
getting
tired
of
and
bacon
his
and
dreaming
how
proud
he
would
be
if
he
could
only
hold
a
position
equal
to
the
captain
s
boots
on
his
feet
that
came
up
to
his
knees
and
gloves
on
his
hands
that
came
clear
up
to
there
said
dan
motioning
with
his
finger
to
a
point
on
his
arm
that
came
clear
up
to
his
elbow
and
didn
t
he
handle
that
horse
gay
she
was
a
frisky
animal
but
he
managed
her
as
easy
as
if
he
was
seated
in
a
and
him
he
went
and
fooled
me
by
this
time
his
father
had
eaten
his
breakfast
and
came
out
to
his
usual
place
on
the
threshold
pipe
he
took
a
few
pulls
at
the
tobacco
cast
his
eye
up
to
the
clouds
to
see
what
the
weather
was
going
to
be
and
was
then
ready
to
begin
his
topic
of
conversation
the
south
is
going
to
whip
said
he
it
don
t
stand
to
reason
that
one
county
in
the
midst
of
a
state
that
s
in
rebellion
is
going
to
whip
all
the
counties
around
but
father
do
you
think
they
are
going
to
fight
asked
dan
fight
no
they
won
t
i
only
wish
i
could
get
my
position
as
colonel
i
would
show
them
how
to
clean
these
men
and
the
men
here
wouldn
t
give
you
the
position
of
secretary
of
war
said
dan
what
would
you
have
done
if
you
had
got
that
position
eh
well
i
would
have
done
a
heap
more
than
that
old
sprague
is
doing
i
can
tell
you
that
i
would
have
made
you
boys
officers
to
begin
with
you
would
make
a
bully
captain
that
s
just
what
i
think
ought
to
be
one
yes
and
think
of
the
money
we
would
make
that
s
what
makes
me
so
down
on
all
these
officers
that
must
be
worth
six
or
eight
thousand
dollars
a
whew
whistled
dan
and
old
sprague
is
making
that
much
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
at
any
rate
they
might
have
offered
it
to
me
and
i
would
ask
how
much
they
was
going
to
give
if
the
price
didn
t
suit
s
the
matter
added
newman
seeing
that
dan
removed
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
sat
up
straight
on
the
ground
do
you
hear
anything
father
there
is
some
one
coming
along
through
the
bushes
said
dan
involuntarily
lowering
his
voice
to
a
whisper
and
they
are
coming
fast
newman
listened
and
presently
he
heard
the
faint
rustle
of
the
thicket
as
a
body
of
men
worked
its
way
through
them
it
was
still
very
faint
but
it
came
plainly
to
his
ears
i
ve
got
to
go
said
dan
hurriedly
you
call
what
have
you
been
said
his
father
in
astonishment
you
stay
where
you
are
and
if
they
should
put
one
of
you
in
the
calaboose
i
d
cut
it
down
as
soon
as
i
could
get
to
it
with
my
i
know
but
i
ll
tell
you
at
some
future
time
what
i
have
been
call
dan
turned
and
made
a
dive
for
the
bushes
and
no
sooner
had
he
disappeared
than
sprague
came
in
sight
while
sprague
was
holding
his
colloquy
with
the
father
and
mother
who
stood
at
the
door
and
bud
mccoy
had
gone
around
the
house
in
time
to
catch
cale
newman
coming
out
of
the
window
leon
noticed
the
pipe
which
dan
had
thrown
down
and
which
was
not
yet
extinguished
he
took
a
few
pulls
at
it
and
it
went
as
lively
as
it
ever
did
dan
is
out
here
in
the
bushes
said
he
to
tom
and
young
dawson
who
remained
close
at
his
side
let
s
go
out
and
capture
all
right
said
dawson
let
us
spread
out
a
little
so
that
we
will
cover
more
ground
be
in
a
hurry
leon
was
out
of
sight
before
he
had
ceased
speaking
he
made
no
attempt
to
draw
his
revolver
for
he
did
not
think
it
would
be
worth
while
he
had
always
known
dan
and
knew
him
to
be
a
lazy
worthless
fellow
but
he
was
little
prepared
for
what
happened
afterward
he
was
looking
everywhere
for
must
have
been
half
a
mile
or
more
from
his
friends
by
this
suddenly
as
he
pressed
down
a
thicket
to
look
into
it
he
felt
something
on
his
back
and
he
was
thrown
violently
on
his
face
knowing
in
a
minute
what
it
was
his
hand
went
behind
him
but
he
felt
some
fingers
at
work
with
his
own
and
his
revolver
was
torn
from
his
grasp
a
feeling
of
horror
came
over
him
when
he
knew
that
he
was
disarmed
the
weight
was
lifted
off
his
back
he
was
rolled
over
so
that
he
could
see
what
he
had
to
contend
with
and
his
own
revolver
was
looking
him
in
the
face
it
was
cocked
too
and
it
needed
only
the
pressure
of
a
finger
to
make
all
things
blank
to
him
it
was
dan
newman
who
was
bending
above
him
his
face
was
very
pale
but
there
was
a
glint
in
his
eyes
that
spoke
volumes
not
a
word
out
of
you
said
dan
fiercely
not
a
word
out
of
you
roll
over
with
your
face
leon
had
no
alternative
but
to
obey
there
was
shoot
in
dan
s
eyes
and
leon
saw
it
he
rolled
over
and
dan
arose
to
his
feet
and
took
off
his
coat
and
then
his
shirt
which
he
proceeded
to
tear
up
into
small
strips
it
was
then
a
task
of
no
difficulty
to
bind
leon
s
arms
it
was
done
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
it
and
then
leon
was
pulled
to
a
sitting
posture
while
dan
stood
and
looked
down
at
him
i
ve
got
you
ain
t
i
said
dan
who
hardly
knew
whether
he
stood
on
his
head
or
his
heels
now
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
i
don
t
see
that
i
can
do
anything
said
leon
wondering
if
he
was
to
give
up
and
remain
a
prisoner
in
the
hands
of
this
man
you
can
do
what
you
please
with
and
it
pleases
me
to
take
you
down
to
mobile
and
give
you
up
to
our
folks
said
dan
mebbe
they
ll
think
that
my
company
is
in
a
condition
for
me
to
command
it
it
ain
t
often
that
a
man
can
get
the
son
of
a
secretary
of
war
prisoner
is
it
leon
did
not
care
to
talk
any
longer
he
knew
what
dan
was
going
to
do
with
him
and
he
did
not
feel
much
elated
over
it
he
sat
there
in
silence
and
watched
dan
who
was
grinning
all
over
and
hardly
knew
whether
or
not
his
good
fortune
had
stood
him
so
well
in
stead
or
not
he
wanted
to
be
sure
about
it
and
so
began
a
conversation
with
leon
or
rather
he
talked
and
leon
listened
he
examined
his
revolver
repeatedly
took
aim
at
certain
spots
on
the
trees
and
acted
for
all
the
world
like
one
who
was
bereft
of
his
senses
having
spent
an
hour
in
this
way
and
being
at
last
satisfied
that
sprague
had
looked
around
the
house
without
being
able
to
find
him
dan
thought
he
would
go
home
and
hold
a
short
consultation
with
his
father
the
old
man
will
be
dreadful
glad
i
ve
got
you
said
dan
wondering
how
he
was
going
to
leave
leon
so
that
he
wouldn
t
arouse
the
whole
neighborhood
by
his
yelling
and
perhaps
he
ll
think
i
had
better
do
something
else
with
you
i
want
to
go
home
and
get
a
shirt
too
for
these
nights
are
mighty
does
the
old
man
believe
as
you
do
asked
leon
he
thought
it
would
be
policy
to
learn
all
he
could
concerning
the
belief
of
the
squatter
s
family
for
he
did
not
expect
to
remain
a
prisoner
all
his
life
when
he
returned
he
would
know
how
to
go
to
work
the
first
thing
he
did
would
be
to
put
all
that
family
under
arrest
of
course
the
old
man
believes
as
i
do
said
dan
the
south
is
going
to
send
men
enough
in
here
to
whip
you
i
tell
you
leon
you
fellows
are
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
that
asked
leon
referring
to
a
piece
of
shirt
which
dan
was
carefully
folding
i
am
going
to
use
it
as
a
gag
said
dan
you
must
think
that
i
am
a
pretty
smart
man
to
go
away
and
leave
you
with
your
mouth
wide
open
now
i
guess
this
will
i
assure
you
that
i
won
t
halloo
exclaimed
leon
who
did
not
like
to
have
any
of
dan
s
clothing
in
his
mouth
try
me
and
no
i
reckon
i
d
best
be
on
the
safe
side
if
you
will
let
this
go
into
your
mouth
well
and
good
if
not
it
will
have
to
go
in
anyway
said
dan
picking
up
his
revolver
there
was
but
one
course
open
to
leon
and
he
submitted
to
have
a
wad
of
shirt
tucked
into
his
mouth
that
almost
made
him
sick
it
was
tied
hard
and
fast
too
so
that
he
could
not
get
rid
of
it
dan
next
turned
his
attention
to
his
feet
which
he
bound
with
another
piece
of
shirt
and
fastened
them
to
a
tree
so
that
he
could
not
get
up
then
he
looked
at
the
way
his
hands
were
fastened
and
got
up
shoving
the
revolver
into
his
pocket
i
won
t
be
gone
but
a
little
while
said
dan
straightening
up
the
thicket
in
which
leon
lay
i
reckon
i
ll
bring
the
old
man
back
here
with
me
you
will
be
glad
to
see
him
i
know
my
father
might
have
been
in
this
county
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
your
old
man
but
no
they
wouldn
t
have
him
for
secretary
of
war
and
now
they
see
what
they
made
by
dan
took
one
more
look
at
his
prisoner
to
see
that
his
bonds
were
all
safe
and
then
went
away
he
was
hardly
out
of
sight
before
leon
began
tugging
and
twisting
at
his
fastenings
in
the
hope
of
being
able
to
get
rid
of
some
of
them
but
the
harder
he
worked
the
more
he
exhausted
himself
dan
had
done
his
work
well
and
finally
leon
gave
it
up
as
a
bad
job
dan
was
gone
fully
an
hour
and
when
he
came
back
leon
noticed
that
he
didn
t
have
a
shirt
on
he
noticed
too
that
he
was
in
pretty
bad
humor
they
have
got
two
sentries
up
there
to
the
house
them
and
i
guess
they
must
be
waiting
for
me
said
dan
as
he
began
to
undo
the
fastenings
that
confined
leon
s
mouth
they
think
i
ll
come
back
after
awhile
but
they
don
t
know
dan
when
leon
felt
the
gag
removed
from
his
mouth
he
coughed
once
or
twice
and
acted
as
if
he
was
about
to
expel
the
contents
of
his
stomach
but
after
awhile
he
was
able
to
reply
to
dan
s
question
it
makes
you
sick
don
t
it
asked
dan
yes
and
that
shirt
would
make
anybody
sick
i
suppose
they
have
got
the
sentries
there
in
order
to
catch
you
when
you
come
but
i
say
they
don
t
know
me
retorted
dan
i
didn
t
go
near
the
house
till
i
had
looked
around
a
bit
and
then
i
saw
those
men
there
and
i
came
away
they
won
t
let
me
get
even
a
shirt
i
wonder
if
they
have
got
cale
where
was
cale
when
the
men
came
up
to
capture
you
he
was
in
the
house
and
fast
then
of
course
they
have
got
him
he
didn
t
come
out
of
the
front
door
or
i
would
have
seen
them
it
rather
bothers
a
man
to
be
up
all
night
don
t
it
who
said
i
was
up
all
night
asked
dan
i
do
you
were
up
all
night
and
held
a
conference
with
that
rebel
who
s
got
a
better
right
you
fellows
here
in
this
county
won
t
give
me
anything
and
i
have
a
right
to
go
where
i
can
get
to
be
a
well
untie
my
feet
will
you
said
leon
who
didn
t
seem
disposed
to
discuss
this
matter
with
dan
you
have
got
them
fastened
to
that
sapling
until
they
hurt
dan
was
accommodating
enough
to
untie
his
feet
but
he
didn
t
make
any
move
towards
untying
his
hands
after
that
he
sat
down
and
held
a
long
talk
with
his
prisoner
who
considering
the
situation
in
which
he
was
placed
took
the
matter
very
coolly
he
knew
he
couldn
t
get
away
but
there
would
come
other
times
he
thought
when
his
hands
would
be
at
liberty
and
then
he
would
try
his
best
at
escape
they
passed
the
afternoon
in
this
way
and
finally
it
began
to
grow
dark
leon
was
getting
hungry
and
he
knew
that
dan
was
bothered
the
same
way
and
consequently
he
was
relieved
when
his
captor
said
he
would
try
and
reach
home
again
and
get
something
but
first
i
must
tie
you
up
said
he
now
what
s
the
use
of
going
to
all
that
trouble
said
leon
who
couldn
t
bear
the
thought
of
having
that
shirt
thrust
into
his
mouth
for
the
second
time
i
didn
t
halloo
no
of
course
you
didn
t
said
dan
with
a
laugh
cause
why
the
gag
wouldn
t
let
you
i
won
t
be
gone
but
a
little
while
and
then
i
will
untie
leon
yielded
with
a
very
bad
grace
while
dan
was
placing
the
gag
in
his
mouth
and
well
he
might
for
there
was
the
revolver
lying
within
easy
reach
of
his
captor
s
hand
he
was
tied
up
just
as
he
was
before
and
dan
after
a
few
parting
words
disappeared
in
the
darkness
oh
how
i
wish
tom
howe
knew
where
i
was
panted
leon
after
he
had
tried
in
vain
to
get
rid
of
some
of
his
bonds
i
ll
bet
you
that
i
wouldn
t
be
here
much
longer
now
what
will
be
done
with
me
if
i
am
given
up
to
the
rebels
beyond
a
doubt
i
ll
be
hanged
for
of
course
they
will
take
revenge
on
my
father
through
me
well
if
i
go
up
there
will
be
one
less
to
fight
dan
was
gone
longer
than
he
was
before
and
when
he
came
back
leon
was
surprised
to
hear
him
talking
to
somebody
of
course
it
was
so
dark
that
he
couldn
t
see
anything
but
as
his
captor
drew
near
he
began
to
recognize
cale
newman
s
voice
leon
was
thunderstruck
he
did
not
know
where
cale
had
been
confined
but
by
some
inadvertence
on
the
part
of
his
jailers
he
had
got
away
leon
was
impatient
to
hear
cale
s
version
of
it
chapter
xv
a
friend
in
need
well
sir
you
have
got
him
as
easy
as
falling
off
a
log
haven
t
you
said
cale
gleefully
as
he
sat
down
on
the
ground
beside
leon
and
passed
his
hands
over
him
from
head
to
foot
it
s
leon
as
sure
as
i
am
alive
and
you
ve
got
him
tied
up
hard
and
fast
he
added
as
he
felt
of
the
prisoner
s
face
hold
on
till
i
take
the
gag
out
of
his
mouth
said
dan
he
talks
as
sassy
as
you
he
does
then
i
would
punch
him
in
the
mouth
for
it
said
cale
who
showed
that
he
could
be
brave
enough
when
he
had
the
power
no
that
won
t
do
said
dan
who
forthwith
proceeded
to
take
the
shirt
out
of
leon
s
mouth
you
are
an
oh
get
out
sneered
cale
i
ll
bet
you
when
our
officers
get
him
into
their
hands
they
ll
treat
him
worse
than
we
they
didn
t
treat
them
so
at
mobile
when
we
saw
those
prisoners
brought
in
there
retorted
dan
we
are
officers
and
i
ll
bet
you
that
i
will
get
some
men
to
command
when
i
give
this
fellow
leon
took
a
few
moments
in
which
to
get
over
the
effect
of
the
shirt
being
in
his
mouth
after
which
he
was
ready
to
talk
to
cale
for
as
we
said
he
was
impatient
to
hear
his
version
of
the
story
of
his
escape
how
did
you
get
away
cale
said
he
you
thought
they
had
me
hard
and
fast
didn
t
you
said
cale
shaking
his
fist
at
leon
well
they
didn
t
they
had
me
in
the
third
story
of
the
hotel
and
once
when
the
sentinel
wasn
t
looking
i
tore
up
the
quilts
they
had
given
me
to
sleep
on
and
dug
didn
t
they
have
any
sentry
under
the
window
said
leon
astonished
at
such
a
want
of
foresight
on
the
part
of
the
union
men
no
they
didn
t
and
i
took
note
of
that
the
first
thing
when
i
went
in
i
stayed
up
close
to
the
building
while
the
sentry
was
looking
out
and
when
he
fired
his
gun
to
let
them
know
that
i
had
gone
i
dug
out
across
the
until
i
struck
the
woods
i
wondered
what
i
should
do
without
dan
and
i
run
onto
him
the
first
thing
now
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
this
fellow
as
soon
as
it
comes
daylight
we
ll
take
him
down
to
ah
that
s
the
place
for
you
said
cale
giving
leon
a
pinch
you
won
t
be
riding
around
on
that
horse
of
yours
and
making
us
all
wish
we
had
one
too
you
ve
got
the
revolver
dan
and
now
i
ll
have
the
horse
i
wish
father
could
get
away
from
the
house
mebbe
he
would
make
you
stretch
hemp
right
where
you
well
cale
as
i
didn
t
have
any
sleep
last
night
i
ll
lie
down
said
dan
do
you
reckon
you
can
watch
him
while
i
doze
a
little
you
re
right
i
can
said
cale
with
savage
emphasis
give
me
your
revolver
now
let
us
see
him
make
a
move
to
get
away
i
ll
stretch
him
out
so
stiff
that
he
won
t
be
of
any
use
down
there
at
that
fellow
has
got
a
mighty
nice
shirt
on
that
i
d
like
to
have
said
dan
as
he
drew
his
coat
about
him
but
couldn
t
confine
it
for
it
had
no
buttons
as
soon
as
it
comes
daylight
i
ll
make
him
shed
that
linen
i
ain
t
among
our
officers
with
no
shirt
why
don
t
you
make
him
take
it
off
now
said
cale
i
ll
watch
him
so
that
he
can
t
run
no
i
guess
i
d
better
be
on
the
safe
side
let
it
go
until
leon
was
glad
that
he
had
such
a
reputation
he
was
able
to
sleep
warm
for
one
night
at
least
his
clothing
was
comfortable
and
his
coat
being
buttoned
up
to
the
chin
and
being
protected
from
the
keen
wind
by
the
thicket
in
which
he
was
placed
he
slept
as
warm
as
he
would
if
he
had
been
at
home
the
only
thing
was
his
hands
hurt
him
he
knew
it
would
be
of
no
use
to
appeal
to
dan
so
he
gritted
his
teeth
and
said
nothing
when
leon
awoke
it
was
broad
daylight
both
his
captors
were
asleep
the
revolver
that
cale
threatened
him
with
was
lying
by
his
side
and
all
he
needed
was
his
hands
at
liberty
to
turn
the
tables
on
them
in
good
shape
by
gracious
muttered
leon
and
once
more
he
began
trying
the
effect
of
dan
s
knots
but
they
were
there
to
stay
he
could
not
move
his
hands
at
all
halloo
here
he
added
aloud
do
you
want
to
go
to
sleep
and
let
me
run
off
i
am
cold
and
it
is
time
i
was
well
now
i
ll
be
shot
said
dan
opening
his
eyes
and
rubbing
them
while
cale
made
a
clutch
for
the
revolver
it
was
good
of
you
not
to
go
you
can
thank
yourself
for
it
said
leon
if
i
could
have
got
away
i
d
had
my
revolver
in
my
hands
and
then
you
would
have
gone
to
yes
and
what
would
we
be
doing
all
that
time
said
cale
you
shut
up
answered
dan
you
said
you
could
watch
him
and
so
you
did
you
went
fast
asleep
watching
i
only
just
closed
my
eyes
that
s
all
protested
cale
if
he
d
any
oh
shut
up
and
let
s
be
moving
interrupted
dan
the
sooner
we
get
him
where
our
officers
are
the
sooner
we
ll
be
rid
of
him
and
get
something
to
leon
found
that
he
was
somewhat
stiff
when
he
came
to
get
upon
his
feet
but
before
they
had
gone
half
a
mile
he
stepped
off
with
his
accustomed
free
stride
dan
led
the
way
with
the
revolver
in
his
hand
and
he
was
considerate
enough
to
keep
the
bushes
from
striking
his
prisoner
in
the
face
leon
knew
how
far
it
was
to
the
river
but
the
distance
seemed
to
lengthen
out
wonderfully
since
he
last
passed
that
way
he
kept
a
bright
in
the
hope
that
he
would
meet
some
of
the
union
men
but
in
this
he
was
disappointed
now
right
up
that
way
not
more
than
a
mile
is
a
company
of
your
fellows
stationed
there
to
watch
the
bridge
said
dan
stopping
at
length
how
much
would
you
give
to
holler
and
bring
them
down
here
don
t
talk
to
him
that
way
exclaimed
cale
disturbed
by
the
thought
the
first
thing
you
know
he
will
then
this
revolver
will
settle
his
hash
said
dan
savagely
let
him
holler
if
he
wants
a
little
further
on
came
the
river
whereupon
dan
backed
off
for
a
few
feet
and
told
cale
to
undo
the
prisoner
s
hands
cale
was
prompt
to
obey
and
the
first
thing
that
leon
did
when
he
felt
his
arms
free
was
to
stretch
them
above
his
head
as
if
he
enjoyed
having
them
at
liberty
once
more
he
did
not
make
a
motion
to
escape
for
there
was
the
revolver
looking
him
in
the
face
now
take
off
your
clothes
you
two
and
be
ready
to
swim
the
river
said
dan
am
i
going
over
there
with
him
asked
cale
and
he
was
thoroughly
frightened
at
the
prospect
you
go
first
and
when
you
get
over
there
you
can
pick
up
a
club
i
ll
keep
his
clothes
behind
with
me
and
the
revolver
too
and
if
he
wants
to
run
off
naked
let
him
go
i
bet
you
he
ll
be
glad
to
have
his
clothes
the
two
boys
lost
no
time
in
taking
off
their
clothes
and
there
was
one
thing
that
leon
didn
t
like
pretty
well
he
would
lose
his
shirt
by
the
operation
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
that
he
could
see
in
due
time
the
boys
were
all
over
and
leon
saw
his
shirt
go
upon
the
back
of
dan
newman
there
now
i
feel
like
myself
again
exclaimed
dan
i
can
go
among
our
officers
now
and
have
a
shirt
on
button
your
coat
up
tight
leon
and
no
wind
can
get
in
now
you
must
have
your
hands
tied
this
much
being
accomplished
the
prisoner
and
his
captors
went
ahead
at
a
more
rapid
pace
the
woods
being
more
open
and
they
held
their
course
parallel
with
the
main
road
their
object
was
to
get
below
the
bend
where
they
would
be
out
of
sight
of
the
sentries
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
they
emerged
from
the
woods
and
striking
the
road
went
on
their
way
with
increased
speed
don
t
you
know
some
place
along
here
where
you
can
go
and
get
something
to
eat
asked
leon
i
could
travel
twice
as
fast
if
i
had
something
on
my
i
was
just
thinking
of
that
thing
myself
answered
dan
i
am
going
to
stop
at
the
first
house
i
meet
and
remember
leon
no
trying
to
get
away
he
added
showing
the
revolver
he
still
carried
in
his
hand
leon
didn
t
make
any
reply
he
knew
now
that
he
was
beyond
all
reach
of
help
and
after
he
got
something
to
was
the
first
thing
on
the
must
make
up
his
mind
to
face
our
officers
who
wouldn
t
be
apt
to
treat
him
any
too
well
but
first
one
house
was
passed
and
then
another
and
as
neither
dan
nor
cale
had
the
courage
to
go
in
and
beg
something
to
eat
leon
finally
gave
it
up
as
a
bad
job
and
thought
he
would
have
to
go
on
to
mobile
before
he
could
get
a
mouthful
to
stay
his
appetite
at
last
they
came
along
to
a
place
that
leon
remembered
the
first
time
he
saw
it
there
was
a
pleasant
and
and
negro
quarters
in
abundance
but
now
everything
had
been
given
up
to
the
flames
and
some
of
the
ruins
were
still
smoking
well
i
declare
somebody
has
been
burned
out
here
said
dan
is
this
the
place
where
you
came
last
night
leon
i
was
around
here
somewhere
replied
leon
then
here
s
where
that
rebel
fellow
lives
continued
dan
it
serves
him
just
right
before
i
take
an
oath
to
support
a
government
and
then
go
back
on
it
i
would
deserve
to
be
burned
out
leon
did
not
make
any
reply
to
this
for
he
thought
that
dan
might
be
burned
out
and
still
not
lose
a
great
deal
by
it
but
he
did
not
want
to
say
so
for
fear
of
making
him
angry
his
captors
had
treated
him
all
right
so
far
but
he
knew
what
the
consequences
would
be
if
he
got
them
down
on
him
while
he
was
thinking
about
it
and
wondering
how
tom
howe
and
young
dawson
would
look
upon
his
certainly
would
know
he
had
been
came
suddenly
around
another
bend
in
the
road
and
saw
before
them
a
long
line
of
horsemen
who
were
travelling
as
though
they
had
some
place
to
reach
before
night
he
took
a
second
glance
at
them
and
saw
that
they
were
all
dressed
in
confederate
uniform
there
s
some
of
our
men
now
exclaimed
dan
so
overjoyed
that
he
took
off
his
hat
and
waved
it
to
them
but
cale
that
ain
t
our
captain
in
front
is
it
he
was
a
big
man
and
this
is
a
little
one
there
must
be
a
whole
regiment
of
them
and
if
that
is
the
case
they
are
going
up
to
whip
the
union
leon
s
heart
fairly
came
up
into
his
mouth
he
would
know
soon
what
the
rebels
were
going
to
do
with
him
the
confederates
discovered
them
as
soon
as
they
came
around
the
bend
and
they
kept
a
close
watch
of
them
until
they
came
up
the
man
in
front
certainly
was
not
a
captain
he
had
a
mark
on
his
collar
that
no
one
had
ever
seen
before
well
boys
where
are
you
going
inquired
the
man
and
they
found
out
before
the
interview
was
over
that
his
men
called
him
colonel
of
course
dan
looked
at
him
with
a
great
deal
of
respect
after
he
found
out
what
his
rank
was
yes
we
ve
got
a
yankee
prisoner
here
said
dan
who
was
expected
to
do
all
the
talking
he
is
the
son
of
the
secretary
of
war
up
in
jones
he
is
hey
exclaimed
the
colonel
beginning
to
show
some
interest
in
the
matter
well
we
ll
send
him
right
down
to
mobile
the
first
thing
we
do
are
you
from
jones
county
dan
replied
that
he
was
then
you
must
know
all
about
the
men
up
there
said
the
colonel
how
many
have
they
got
anyway
a
thousand
fighting
men
replied
dan
and
i
tell
you
you
will
want
more
men
than
you
have
got
here
to
whip
i
don
t
know
about
that
we
have
got
a
thousand
men
here
in
this
regiment
and
they
are
all
disciplined
and
when
they
draw
up
against
your
crowd
of
bushwhackers
you
will
see
some
scattering
now
we
want
to
get
across
that
bridge
how
far
is
it
from
here
you
will
find
it
right
straight
up
this
road
about
twenty
miles
you
want
to
be
careful
because
they
have
got
ten
men
hidden
up
there
and
they
are
all
good
we
will
take
care
of
them
don
t
you
fear
now
after
we
get
across
the
bridge
we
must
deploy
in
line
of
battle
how
far
will
we
have
to
go
before
we
can
strike
their
main
line
it
is
ten
miles
from
the
bridge
to
ellisville
and
when
you
get
there
you
will
find
all
the
men
you
well
now
see
here
suppose
you
go
with
me
you
know
all
the
crooks
and
turns
of
the
road
that
but
captain
began
dan
this
gentleman
is
a
colonel
interrupted
the
man
who
rode
by
his
commanding
officer
s
side
a
colonel
exclaimed
dan
somewhat
surprised
to
find
that
he
had
found
the
man
who
held
the
position
his
father
was
working
for
colonel
i
am
glad
to
meet
you
he
added
advancing
and
thrusting
out
a
dirty
begrimed
hand
to
the
man
who
merely
reached
down
and
touched
the
tips
of
it
with
his
fingers
my
father
calculates
to
hold
the
position
of
colonel
when
he
has
delivered
up
all
the
head
men
of
the
county
into
your
hands
but
colonel
i
want
to
see
this
man
located
in
mobile
i
had
a
heap
of
trouble
to
gobble
him
and
i
don
t
want
to
lose
but
that
wasn
t
the
principal
reason
why
dan
did
not
want
to
go
back
some
of
the
men
at
the
bridge
would
be
certain
to
recognize
him
and
if
he
escaped
the
bullets
which
they
would
send
after
him
he
would
not
dare
go
home
we
ll
take
care
of
him
said
the
colonel
the
son
of
the
secretary
of
war
is
too
valuable
to
what
do
you
reckon
you
will
do
with
him
colonel
hang
him
leon
heard
the
words
and
looked
around
at
dan
and
cale
dan
smiled
upon
him
as
if
he
had
just
heard
a
glorious
piece
of
news
but
cale
was
grinning
with
delight
he
said
to
himself
if
leon
is
going
to
be
hung
i
ll
have
his
adjutant
pick
out
a
good
trusty
man
to
march
this
fellow
to
mobile
said
the
colonel
a
faithful
fellow
mind
captain
cullom
have
you
such
a
man
in
your
company
said
the
adjutant
turning
to
the
officer
who
commanded
the
advance
of
the
line
yes
sir
ballard
step
out
here
the
man
referred
to
who
was
one
of
the
leading
fours
of
his
company
urged
his
horse
to
the
front
and
brought
his
hand
to
his
hat
with
a
military
salute
then
he
slung
his
carbine
upon
his
shoulder
and
drew
his
revolver
from
his
belt
leon
looked
at
him
and
he
told
himself
that
if
he
had
been
a
rebel
he
would
have
trusted
that
man
with
his
life
he
was
young
not
more
than
but
he
was
from
texas
and
had
been
a
cowboy
all
his
life
consequently
he
was
a
little
better
clad
than
the
majority
of
his
comrades
ballard
you
take
this
man
before
general
lowery
and
tell
him
that
i
sent
him
said
the
colonel
tell
him
that
he
is
the
son
of
a
man
of
jones
county
and
let
him
do
what
he
pleases
with
very
good
sir
answered
ballard
i
wouldn
t
untie
his
hands
continued
the
colonel
but
you
have
got
your
revolver
in
your
hands
and
can
easily
stop
him
in
case
he
runs
for
the
very
good
sir
replied
ballard
forward
march
go
off
at
one
side
of
the
road
so
as
to
be
out
of
the
way
of
the
now
two
of
the
men
must
make
room
for
these
boys
said
the
colonel
forward
dan
and
cale
were
quickly
provided
with
places
to
ride
behind
two
of
the
cavalrymen
the
adjutant
shouted
forward
with
all
the
strength
of
his
lungs
and
leon
stood
at
one
side
of
the
road
and
watched
the
men
as
they
marched
by
he
had
heard
a
good
deal
about
texas
and
he
finally
came
to
the
conclusion
that
all
the
soldiers
were
from
that
region
they
were
all
and
many
of
them
were
unacquainted
with
combs
but
there
were
some
among
them
who
were
dressed
like
his
cowboy
with
handkerchiefs
around
their
necks
broad
tarpaulins
on
their
heads
and
fine
boots
on
their
feet
a
good
many
of
them
had
a
word
to
say
to
ballard
and
his
prisoner
and
they
were
not
of
the
kind
that
was
calculated
to
encourage
leon
when
leon
wasn
t
looking
ballard
raised
his
pistol
and
took
a
deliberate
aim
at
his
proceeding
that
was
welcomed
by
shouts
from
all
the
men
who
saw
it
that
s
the
way
shoot
him
down
shouted
one
of
the
soldiers
there
will
be
one
less
yank
for
us
left
to
fight
now
sonny
i
guess
all
the
men
have
passed
said
ballard
take
the
middle
of
the
road
and
travel
ahead
as
if
you
were
going
for
the
doctor
mobile
is
a
long
ways
from
leon
accordingly
took
to
the
road
and
plodded
along
at
his
best
pace
but
he
was
wearied
and
his
hands
hurt
him
so
that
he
was
on
the
point
of
urging
his
captor
to
untie
them
for
a
little
while
so
that
he
could
stretch
his
arms
and
get
the
kinks
out
of
them
he
walked
along
until
he
had
got
around
the
first
bend
out
of
sight
of
the
cavalrymen
and
then
ballard
after
looking
all
around
and
up
and
down
the
road
to
make
sure
that
there
was
nobody
in
sight
leaned
forward
and
whispered
to
him
say
sonny
go
into
the
leon
turned
around
and
faced
him
he
had
heard
that
was
one
way
the
confederates
had
of
getting
rid
of
their
prisoners
namely
to
take
them
into
the
woods
and
lose
them
they
would
shoot
them
down
and
leave
them
there
leon
couldn
t
help
himself
if
ballard
had
decided
to
lose
him
for
his
hands
were
tied
what
will
i
go
in
there
for
he
asked
and
one
wouldn
t
suppose
that
his
life
was
in
danger
to
hear
him
talk
go
into
the
woods
quick
said
ballard
i
m
the
revulsion
of
feeling
was
so
great
that
leon
staggered
and
would
have
fallen
to
the
ground
if
ballard
had
not
ridden
up
and
caught
him
by
the
collar
go
in
there
quick
before
some
one
sees
you
said
ballard
looking
up
and
down
the
road
as
he
spoke
i
wouldn
t
hurt
the
hair
of
your
head
i
ve
wanted
to
get
with
those
jones
county
people
ever
since
i
have
been
here
and
now
i
have
got
a
chance
at
last
go
into
the
woods
quick
as
you
can
walk
i
ll
untie
your
hands
in
leon
waited
to
hear
no
more
but
dived
straight
into
the
bushes
and
he
never
stopped
until
he
had
gone
half
a
mile
from
the
road
but
fast
as
he
went
ballard
was
close
behind
him
when
he
stopped
his
captor
dismounted
and
pulled
a
big
from
his
boot
one
blow
was
enough
and
leon
s
arms
were
free
ballard
i
never
shall
forget
you
said
leon
and
his
voice
was
somewhat
husky
as
he
spoke
i
have
been
wondering
how
i
should
get
away
but
i
never
thought
that
you
would
help
me
you
are
a
friend
indeed
but
first
i
want
to
know
if
you
have
anything
to
eat
in
your
haversack
i
haven
t
had
a
bite
since
ballard
at
once
unslung
his
haversack
and
while
leon
was
regaling
himself
on
the
and
bacon
which
tasted
wonderfully
good
to
him
he
told
leon
how
he
happened
to
go
into
the
service
while
he
knew
that
the
south
was
going
to
be
utterly
impoverished
he
owned
a
fine
in
texas
and
when
the
southern
men
around
him
began
to
talk
of
going
into
her
service
he
found
that
he
had
to
go
too
or
run
the
risk
of
stretching
hemp
i
didn
t
want
to
go
for
a
long
time
said
ballard
and
when
i
found
that
my
neighbors
were
all
giving
in
their
names
and
began
to
look
at
me
and
make
remarks
that
people
who
were
not
for
us
were
against
us
i
saw
it
was
high
time
i
was
doing
something
so
i
got
an
englishman
to
take
care
of
my
place
and
here
i
am
i
tell
you
there
is
a
lot
of
men
in
the
rebel
army
that
think
just
the
same
as
i
let
them
come
over
into
our
county
and
we
ll
treat
them
right
said
leon
father
says
we
will
have
at
least
ten
thousand
men
and
it
is
going
to
take
more
than
double
that
number
of
men
to
whip
us
now
ballard
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
this
breakfast
and
i
am
now
able
to
go
on
are
you
going
to
take
your
horse
with
you
oh
i
couldn
t
think
of
going
anywhere
without
that
horse
said
ballard
hastily
i
ll
warrant
that
if
the
rebels
went
by
within
ten
feet
of
us
he
wouldn
t
say
a
leon
at
once
stepped
out
at
his
old
pace
and
ballard
kept
close
behind
him
the
woods
were
so
thick
that
they
couldn
t
stop
to
do
much
talking
and
by
the
time
it
began
to
grow
dark
they
were
on
the
banks
of
the
creek
now
we
are
half
way
home
said
leon
i
would
like
to
know
just
how
that
cavalry
came
out
in
attacking
our
men
i
ve
listened
every
once
in
a
while
but
i
didn
t
hear
any
sound
of
rifles
or
probably
they
are
too
far
away
for
us
to
hear
them
said
ballard
if
your
men
will
oh
they
will
fight
and
there
are
some
of
them
with
us
who
have
repeatedly
declared
that
they
won
t
take
any
prisoners
if
they
drive
our
men
back
to
the
swamp
they
are
whipped
sure
by
gracious
what
s
that
it
sounds
like
a
couple
of
horses
coming
through
the
ballard
took
his
horse
by
the
bridle
to
hold
his
head
down
in
case
he
wanted
to
call
to
them
and
listened
intently
soon
the
measured
tread
of
the
horses
could
be
heard
coming
through
the
woods
and
in
a
few
minutes
a
couple
of
rebels
appeared
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
creek
and
but
a
short
distance
above
them
one
of
the
confederates
had
no
hat
on
his
left
arm
was
hanging
loose
by
his
side
and
his
companion
was
holding
him
on
his
horse
they
paused
for
a
few
moments
as
if
they
didn
t
know
what
to
do
with
the
creek
in
front
of
them
and
then
the
uninjured
one
urged
the
horses
in
and
in
a
few
strokes
of
the
hoofs
they
were
safe
across
i
ll
tell
you
what
s
the
matter
with
our
side
said
ballard
as
soon
as
the
two
rebels
had
disappeared
in
the
bushes
we
have
been
whipped
do
you
mean
to
say
that
our
fellows
have
whipped
the
cavalry
inquired
leon
and
he
was
surprised
and
delighted
to
hear
it
that
is
just
what
i
mean
if
the
cavalry
had
been
successful
they
would
have
kept
to
the
road
and
taken
some
prisoners
with
them
but
their
being
scattered
in
this
way
makes
me
think
that
they
have
been
worsted
you
saw
that
man
who
was
being
held
on
his
horse
well
he
was
we
have
got
to
swim
the
creek
before
we
can
get
over
said
leon
i
am
impatient
to
see
how
my
father
came
out
take
off
your
clothes
and
hold
them
above
your
head
i
ll
carry
your
carbine
for
leon
worked
in
earnest
now
for
his
father
had
been
in
danger
and
he
was
not
there
to
share
it
in
hardly
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
it
he
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
bayou
and
pulling
on
his
clothes
ballard
was
not
very
far
behind
him
and
seeing
how
impatient
leon
was
he
donned
his
uniform
with
all
possible
haste
after
which
they
struck
out
for
ellisville
chapter
xvi
a
fight
and
its
results
let
us
now
return
to
the
cavalrymen
and
see
how
they
came
out
in
their
assault
on
the
union
men
who
had
been
left
to
guard
the
bridge
and
particularly
to
tell
how
dan
and
cale
felt
when
they
found
themselves
going
back
among
those
who
would
be
sure
to
know
them
cale
was
frightened
and
consequently
he
said
nothing
but
dan
was
just
scared
enough
to
have
plenty
of
talk
in
him
take
that
man
up
behind
you
said
captain
cullom
addressing
himself
to
one
of
the
leading
fours
of
his
company
up
you
come
with
a
jump
said
the
man
reaching
down
to
catch
dan
by
the
hand
oh
now
i
tell
you
i
don
t
want
to
get
up
there
said
dan
those
people
at
the
bridge
will
surely
know
me
and
i
ll
be
tumbled
off
with
the
first
volley
you
get
on
up
there
said
captain
cullom
and
he
reached
over
as
if
he
was
going
to
draw
his
sword
give
us
your
hand
said
the
man
getting
impatient
now
throw
your
leg
over
the
back
of
the
horse
you
are
southerner
enough
to
do
dan
finally
made
out
to
get
on
the
cavalryman
s
horse
but
it
was
more
the
effects
of
the
sword
which
had
leaped
out
of
its
scabbard
while
the
captain
was
talking
to
him
cale
was
already
seated
behind
his
man
and
in
response
to
the
adjutant
s
order
forward
they
moved
toward
the
bridge
dan
was
more
than
to
cry
when
he
found
that
he
must
go
whether
he
wanted
to
or
not
and
the
man
he
was
with
began
to
torment
him
oh
they
will
give
it
to
you
if
they
catch
you
up
there
said
he
in
a
tone
so
low
that
the
captain
couldn
t
hear
it
say
charlie
you
remember
what
they
done
to
those
two
fellows
they
caught
down
to
mobile
you
re
right
i
do
replied
the
man
thus
addressed
they
hung
em
up
to
the
nearest
what
did
they
do
that
for
asked
dan
because
they
wanted
to
betray
their
friends
into
our
hands
said
the
man
but
these
ain
t
friends
of
mine
replied
dan
i
ve
been
down
on
them
ever
since
i
have
been
no
matter
you
know
what
we
will
do
to
them
if
we
catch
them
and
the
others
will
serve
you
the
same
way
i
would
rather
be
in
my
boots
than
in
but
you
are
going
to
lick
them
ain
t
you
lick
them
of
course
we
are
that
s
what
we
are
going
up
here
for
have
you
got
any
friends
there
i
ve
got
a
father
and
a
then
they
had
better
get
out
we
re
going
to
sweep
everything
clean
there
won
t
be
hide
nor
hair
left
of
a
union
man
now
if
you
will
let
me
get
off
and
go
through
the
woods
said
dan
i
can
warn
my
can
t
do
it
said
the
man
shaking
his
head
didn
t
you
hear
what
the
captain
said
if
you
were
in
the
service
you
would
know
how
to
obey
silence
in
the
ranks
commanded
captain
cullom
and
this
put
a
stop
to
all
conversation
between
them
although
dan
had
many
things
that
he
wanted
to
say
after
this
they
rode
along
in
a
sort
of
a
fox
trot
but
dan
noticed
that
they
didn
t
take
as
much
pains
to
go
quietly
as
the
squad
had
done
the
night
before
by
the
time
they
got
to
the
bend
dan
was
certain
that
the
pickets
had
heard
them
and
taken
to
the
bushes
and
when
they
got
around
it
in
plain
view
of
the
bridge
there
was
not
a
sentinel
in
sight
but
before
they
had
gone
many
feet
along
the
road
a
voice
called
out
halt
who
comes
there
draw
sabres
and
revolvers
shouted
the
colonel
and
the
order
was
repeated
by
the
adjutant
who
galloped
back
along
the
column
and
yelled
out
the
command
as
he
went
forward
charge
in
a
second
dan
was
flying
along
the
road
faster
than
he
had
ever
travelled
on
horseback
before
and
in
another
second
the
line
was
thrown
into
confusion
by
a
discharge
of
rifles
and
carbines
from
the
woods
on
each
side
of
the
bridge
the
shots
were
too
for
each
man
was
sure
of
his
mark
the
colonel
and
his
horse
went
down
and
so
did
the
two
men
who
were
carrying
dan
and
cale
double
the
leading
four
were
also
badly
cut
up
and
before
the
major
could
get
up
to
command
in
place
of
his
colonel
a
second
discharge
followed
which
came
within
an
ace
of
putting
the
column
to
a
rout
dan
and
cale
were
on
their
feet
as
soon
as
they
struck
the
ground
the
former
with
his
left
arm
hanging
loose
and
the
latter
with
a
through
both
cheeks
i
ve
got
it
now
i
ve
got
it
now
moaned
dan
and
when
he
tried
to
raise
his
arm
he
saw
that
the
lower
part
of
it
was
useless
and
i
too
yelled
cale
what
s
the
matter
with
my
face
dan
i
can
t
hardly
but
dan
wasn
t
staying
around
there
to
tell
cale
what
was
the
matter
with
his
face
in
fact
he
didn
t
think
anything
of
his
brother
at
all
for
his
thoughts
were
wrapped
up
in
his
own
wound
he
gazed
at
the
fallen
men
who
were
scattered
around
him
heard
the
major
issue
some
rapid
orders
and
then
he
too
fell
off
his
horse
the
pickets
were
evidently
going
for
the
officers
and
they
made
short
work
of
them
dan
saw
and
heard
all
this
and
then
made
a
desperate
lunge
for
the
bushes
and
cale
was
close
at
his
heels
when
he
got
there
oh
my
face
groaned
cale
i
wish
i
knew
what
was
the
matter
with
do
you
think
there
is
nobody
killed
but
yourself
retorted
dan
look
at
this
arm
it
don
t
hurt
me
so
much
but
it
feels
bruised
and
you
have
got
nothing
but
a
through
your
by
this
time
the
column
was
under
command
of
a
captain
who
had
little
difficulty
in
rallying
them
and
dan
heard
a
yell
such
as
he
had
never
heard
before
the
yell
of
charging
cavalry
and
he
saw
the
body
of
men
sweep
on
toward
the
bridge
but
when
they
got
there
they
saw
the
union
pickets
far
up
the
road
but
they
loaded
their
rifles
as
fast
as
they
went
and
when
they
turned
around
to
fire
at
their
pursuers
some
man
was
certain
to
go
down
at
last
the
captain
who
commanded
the
cavalry
went
over
also
and
this
left
captain
cullom
who
was
the
second
in
rank
in
charge
of
the
regiment
forward
he
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
voice
they
are
going
on
ahead
to
arouse
the
other
men
and
we
must
overtake
them
before
they
get
again
that
charging
yell
arose
and
it
was
answered
by
yells
equally
as
savage
from
the
union
men
who
turned
and
fired
another
volley
at
them
the
ten
miles
that
lay
between
them
and
ellisville
were
quickly
passed
over
and
by
the
time
the
pickets
had
arrived
within
sight
of
the
camp
there
was
not
a
man
to
be
seen
the
houses
didn
t
look
as
though
there
was
anybody
around
them
but
when
they
came
nearer
they
found
that
every
window
was
filled
with
sharpshooters
the
church
too
was
used
as
a
barricade
and
as
it
stood
broadside
to
the
road
we
can
imagine
that
it
must
have
been
hot
work
for
that
column
of
cavalry
to
have
stood
against
it
as
they
came
opposite
the
hotel
the
door
opened
and
knight
and
sprague
stepped
out
what
is
going
on
down
the
road
asked
the
former
the
rebs
are
coming
shouted
half
a
dozen
voices
they
have
got
a
whole
regiment
of
cavalry
with
them
we
hain
t
lost
a
you
have
done
nobly
said
sprague
go
around
behind
the
and
make
your
horses
fast
and
go
in
there
be
ready
to
shoot
when
you
hear
this
looks
like
a
fight
said
one
of
the
pickets
as
they
made
their
way
into
the
church
boys
i
laid
out
one
traitor
the
first
fire
i
had
it
was
that
miserable
dan
and
i
made
all
haste
to
lay
out
the
other
one
chimed
in
a
second
his
brother
cale
newman
was
there
and
bob
here
shot
the
man
s
horse
and
i
took
particular
aim
at
his
head
i
know
i
hit
him
but
i
did
not
fix
him
i
saw
him
get
up
and
go
into
the
here
they
come
said
one
of
the
who
was
keeping
watch
at
one
of
the
windows
there
is
lots
of
them
ain
t
they
yes
but
it
is
going
to
take
more
than
they
have
got
to
get
away
with
us
said
one
of
the
pickets
if
ten
men
can
throw
a
column
like
that
into
confusion
they
won
t
stand
long
against
the
fire
of
five
now
all
you
men
who
can
get
there
at
the
window
fire
your
one
shot
and
then
fall
back
and
give
somebody
else
a
chance
said
the
one
who
had
refused
to
give
cale
newman
a
mule
in
that
way
we
can
keep
up
a
regular
fusillade
on
the
confederates
came
on
yelling
as
they
went
and
there
was
more
than
one
man
who
took
note
of
the
fact
that
discipline
was
a
great
thing
all
those
in
front
were
coming
to
their
death
but
not
one
was
seen
to
flinch
the
men
in
the
church
began
to
wonder
if
sprague
had
forgotten
how
to
shoot
his
signal
was
so
long
delayed
and
some
of
the
most
excitable
ones
yelled
fire
as
the
rebels
came
on
but
the
calm
voice
of
their
leader
broke
in
with
steady
there
men
don
t
shoot
until
you
have
the
word
and
scarcely
had
he
got
the
words
out
of
his
mouth
when
a
came
from
the
hotel
across
the
way
and
an
instant
afterward
nearly
a
thousand
rifles
and
carbines
cracked
in
unison
the
slaughter
was
fearful
the
captain
who
was
leading
the
charge
fell
with
a
dozen
bullets
in
his
person
and
when
the
smoke
cleared
away
so
that
they
could
see
the
effect
of
the
shot
they
found
that
the
leading
company
had
been
dismounted
and
their
horses
were
running
about
as
if
they
didn
t
know
which
way
to
go
now
you
men
at
the
window
who
have
had
a
hand
in
this
fall
back
said
the
quartermaster
but
nobody
seemed
to
hear
him
the
men
struggled
to
keep
their
places
and
the
men
in
the
body
of
the
church
finding
that
no
opportunity
was
to
be
given
them
opened
the
door
and
went
out
then
the
rebels
got
another
volley
and
it
was
almost
as
disastrous
as
the
first
and
this
wasn
t
the
worst
of
it
all
the
men
came
out
from
their
from
the
hotel
and
from
behind
the
trees
that
concealed
them
in
the
grove
and
the
surviving
rebels
seeing
nothing
before
them
but
a
regiment
of
union
men
who
were
backed
by
rifles
that
never
missed
and
more
running
up
to
join
them
took
to
their
heels
and
made
the
best
of
their
time
down
the
road
get
on
your
horses
and
follow
them
shouted
knight
from
the
window
of
the
hotel
don
t
let
one
escape
that
was
the
way
the
rebels
got
scattered
the
union
men
pursued
them
on
fresh
horses
and
some
of
them
seeing
that
their
chances
for
escape
were
slim
indeed
threw
down
their
arms
and
surrendered
while
the
rest
took
off
through
the
woods
that
was
the
time
that
leon
and
ballard
might
have
added
some
glory
to
their
escape
by
capturing
the
two
men
who
went
across
the
creek
but
the
trouble
was
they
didn
t
know
how
the
thing
had
ended
now
if
you
think
they
were
whipped
we
can
go
up
the
main
road
said
leon
but
i
really
shouldn
t
like
to
get
so
close
to
home
and
then
have
them
jump
onto
i
shouldn
t
like
it
either
said
ballard
with
a
laugh
i
would
be
apt
to
fare
worse
than
you
would
but
can
t
we
go
on
and
reconnoitre
the
ground
if
we
find
some
of
your
men
there
we
ll
be
let
us
try
it
said
leon
anything
is
better
than
walking
through
this
thick
leon
was
not
more
than
half
a
mile
below
the
bridge
and
before
he
had
gone
that
distance
he
heard
somebody
talking
in
the
road
he
raised
his
hand
to
ballard
and
the
latter
at
once
took
his
horse
by
the
head
and
forced
it
down
leon
held
on
and
after
carefully
feeling
his
way
came
upon
several
union
men
who
were
gathered
about
a
rebel
who
had
been
shot
from
his
horse
one
of
the
union
men
he
recognized
as
bud
mccoy
but
who
the
others
were
he
didn
t
know
halloo
there
you
licked
them
didn
t
you
well

ll

exclaimed
the
man
as
he
turned
about
and
saw
leon
advancing
upon
him
through
the
bushes
where
have
you
been
your
pap

been
in
a
heap
of
worry
about

be
said
leon

a
prisoner

on
ballard
it
s
all
the
men
all
straightened
were
busy
getting
ready
to
remove
the
wounded
presently
saw
ballard
coming
through
the
woods
leading
his
horse
and
here
s
the
man
who
saved
me
added
leon
know
him
boys
his
name
is
ballard
he
was
going
to
take
me
down
to
mobile
but
after
he
got
out
of
sight
of
the
rebels
he
asked
me
into
the
woods
and
gave
me
something
to
eat
how
many
of
the
confederates
did
you
kill
but
first
i
want
to
know
how
you
came
to
be
taken
prisoner
said
bud
did
you
run
onto
the
rebels
before
you
knew
it
the
last
time

saw
you

were
up
to
old
newman
s
no
i
didn
t
run
onto
the
rebels
before
i
saw
them
said
leon
and
he
knew
the
confession
he
was
about
to
make

not
meet
the
entire
approval
of
bud
mccoy

a
prisoner
of

happened
to
me
there

revolver

at

his
brother

through

exclaimed
leon
who
felt
very
much
disappointed
to
hear
it
he
had
always
contended
that
no
newman
could
handle
him
and
now
he
would
have
to
live
with

shadow
on
his
mind
i

i
can
ride

that
gray
said
one
of
the
men
i
have
got
to
carry
this
man
to
ellisville
so
i
will
have
to
leon
thanked
him
unhitched
the
horse
swung
himself
upon
his
back
and
galloped
across
the
bridge
and
down
the
road
to
the
place
where
his
two
friends
were
at
work
tom
and
dawson
were
surprised
to
see
him
and
while
he
was
telling
them
the
story
he
looked
all
around
to
find
dan
and
cale
he
wanted
to
see
how
badly
hurt
dan
was
for
he
believed
if
they
were
to
measure
strength
once
more
that
dan
would
go
under
there
s
one
thing
that
happened
about
this
business
that
you
won
t
like
said
tom
and
he
spoke
as
though
he
was
very
much
disheartened
himself
old
man
smith
was
badly
wounded
during
the
why
how
did
that
happen
asked
leon
in
surprise
well
you
must
know
that
all
the
shooting
that
was
done
wasn
t
confined
to
our
men
said
tom
the
rebels
rallied
two
or
three
times
and
every
time
they
poured
in
a
but
how
did
smith
get
hit
wasn
t
he
under
cover
yes
he
was
in
the
hotel
with
your
father
but
he
came
out
he
was
just
getting
all
ready
to
fire
when
a
bullet
took
him
in
the
side
and
over
he
leon
was
very
sorry
to
hear
this
he
remembered
that
smith
had
told
him
particularly
that
he
had
something
to
say
to
him
and
he
had
not
been
near
him
since
perhaps
if
he
went
directly
home
he
would
get
there
in
time
to
hear
what
he
had
to
say
he
didn
t
think
it
anything
worth
listening
to
but
he
would
show
his
while
he
was
looking
around
at
the
dead
and
wounded
confederates
lying
he
was
really
surprised
when
he
saw
what
a
havoc
ten
guns
had
made
in
the
assaulting
became
aware
that
there
was
a
man
leaning
on
a
rifle
and
keeping
guard
over
several
prisoners
among
them
were
dan
and
cale
one
s
arm
and
the
other
s
face
had
been
bandaged
after
a
fashion
and
they
were
waiting
until
the
rebels
were
all
gathered
up
when
they
would
go
on
to
ellisville
and
be
placed
under
the
care
of
the
doctor
leon
gave
his
horse
the
rein
and
rode
up
and
accosted
dan
well
old
fellow
i
am
sorry
to
see
you
in
this
fix
said
he
yes
no
doubt
you
are
glad
of
it
whined
dan
moving
his
wounded
arm
to
a
better
place
i
am
really
i
was
in
hopes
that
you
and
i
would
come
together
again
and
i
wanted
you
to
see
that
you
couldn
t
take
me
down
as
easy
as
you
did
before
you
handled
me
as
easy
as
though
i
wasn
t
i
can
do
it
all
the
time
replied
dan
snappishly
for
just
then
his
arm
pained
him
and
he
moved
it
to
another
position
i
can
get
away
with
you
the
best
day
you
ever
oh
it
is
very
easy
for
you
to
talk
that
way
now
but
if
you
had
two
good
arms
i
would
try
you
right
say
leon
what
do
you
reckon
those
fellows
will
do
with
us
after
they
get
us
to
ellisville
said
cale
speaking
with
difficulty
i
am
sure
i
don
t
know
if
i
had
my
way
with
you
i
would
send
you
among
the
rebels
with
orders
not
to
come
back
you
talk
of
the
rebels
as
our
men
and
you
belong
with
i
guess
you
ll
stretch
hemp
said
the
man
who
was
acting
as
sentry
over
them
i
hope
they
won
t
go
that
far
but
i
don
t
know
said
leon
as
he
turned
his
horse
about
and
started
for
ellisville
it
was
getting
dark
by
this
time
but
all
the
way
leon
saw
some
signs
of
the
fight
here
was
a
dead
rebel
who
had
been
shot
during
the
retreat
and
who
had
fallen
in
the
middle
of
the
road
and
he
had
been
moved
out
on
one
side
and
his
body
covered
with
a
blanket
a
little
further
on
he
came
across
a
wagon
which
was
loaded
with
wounded
confederates
and
the
union
men
all
greeted
him
as
though
they
were
glad
to
see
him
there
was
one
thing
about
it
if
there
was
any
faith
to
be
put
in
what
the
men
said
to
him
his
father
had
been
in
a
constant
worry
ever
since
he
failed
to
show
up
at
newman
s
house
and
he
became
so
satisfied
that
newman
was
to
blame
for
his
sprague
knew
that
somebody
had
made
a
prisoner
of
he
sent
a
squad
of
men
back
to
the
house
and
placed
them
all
in
custody
finally
leon
came
up
to
the
place
where
the
slaughter
had
taken
effect
when
the
confederates
got
ready
to
make
their
charge
and
he
shuddered
when
he
looked
at
it
the
rebels
and
their
horses
had
fallen
together
in
a
heap
until
they
were
piled
on
top
of
one
another
the
union
men
had
not
got
through
removing
them
yet
by
gracious
if
those
rebels
could
come
up
here
from
mobile
and
see
what
i
have
seen
i
ll
bet
they
would
give
up
trying
to
conquer
us
said
leon
as
he
once
more
gave
his
horse
the
rein
and
drew
up
before
the
hotel
porch
i
didn
t
suppose
that
a
battle
ended
in
that
way
i
thought
the
dead
and
wounded
were
scattered
all
around
and
that
you
had
to
hunt
a
long
time
before
you
found
them
never
want
to
see
another
the
hotel
porch
was
empty
when
he
got
there
but
a
little
way
up
toward
the
grove
he
saw
a
company
of
confederates
all
huddled
together
and
union
men
were
keeping
guard
over
them
they
were
waiting
there
until
their
paroles
could
be
made
out
you
see
they
had
no
in
jones
county
and
everything
like
this
had
to
be
made
out
by
hand
he
went
up
into
the
president
s
room
and
there
he
found
as
many
men
as
could
find
seats
at
the
table
engaged
in
writing
some
of
the
prisoners
were
there
to
assist
them
the
way
we
do
this
said
knight
addressing
himself
to
the
captain
who
had
last
commanded
the
regiment
by
the
way
he
was
wounded
too
for
a
handkerchief
that
was
wet
with
blood
was
tied
around
his
forehead
the
way
we
do
this
is
all
owing
to
you
rebels
alone
you
have
not
hung
any
of
our
men
yet
indeed
i
don
t
know
that
you
have
had
a
chance
but
if
you
had
hung
any
of
them
we
should
pick
out
as
many
men
as
had
been
executed
and
hang
them
to
the
nearest
tree
we
want
you
to
understand
that
these
paroles
are
matters
of
life
and
death
with
you
if
you
go
into
battle
against
us
without
being
exchanged
and
we
capture
you
you
can
expect
nothing
but
death
i
think
you
have
found
out
by
the
way
that
cavalry
charged
upon
us
that
we
know
how
to
fight
how
many
men
had
you
to
go
back
to
mobile
well
sir
i
should
say
about
two
and
how
many
had
you
in
the
first
place
we
marched
up
here
to
assault
you
with
eleven
hundred
men
and
only
two
hundred
escaped
that
s
doing
pretty
good
leon
was
astonished
when
he
found
out
that
so
small
a
number
of
confederates
had
got
away
and
then
seeing
that
the
conversation
between
the
president
and
the
rebel
captain
had
ceased
he
began
looking
around
for
his
father
he
found
him
at
last
sitting
at
a
table
in
a
remote
corner
of
the
room
and
walked
up
and
placed
his
hand
upon
his
shoulder
sprague
looked
up
and
finding
leon
s
face
beaming
down
upon
him
put
his
pen
in
his
mouth
and
extended
his
hand
halloo
leon
you
have
got
back
haven
t
you
he
exclaimed
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
saw
his
father
s
eyes
filled
with
tears
yes
sir
i
have
got
back
where
s
smith
mr
smith
has
got
his
i
am
afraid
said
his
father
looking
down
at
the
paper
on
which
he
was
writing
with
a
most
gloomy
expression
he
wants
to
see
you
bad
and
i
would
advise
you
to
go
down
to
him
at
once
you
will
find
him
in
the
parlor
lying
on
the
leon
waited
to
hear
no
more
but
worked
his
way
through
the
men
toward
the
door
stopping
to
shake
hands
with
this
one
or
to
give
a
bow
and
a
smile
to
another
and
presently
found
himself
in
the
parlor
the
doctor
was
there
and
bending
over
the
wounded
man
and
so
was
a
distant
relative
of
his
who
seemed
determined
that
the
doctor
should
not
exchange
any
words
with
smith
without
he
could
hear
them
leon
had
never
liked
that
man
leonard
smith
it
is
true
that
he
had
never
worked
for
his
father
nor
for
smith
either
for
there
was
something
about
him
that
neither
of
the
gentlemen
approved
of
he
was
constantly
telling
around
that
he
was
going
to
have
a
lot
of
money
one
of
these
days
and
nobody
knew
where
he
was
going
to
get
it
smith
had
a
little
just
how
much
no
one
knew
and
it
was
very
clear
to
everyone
that
leonard
smith
wouldn
t
get
any
of
it
when
he
got
done
with
it
smith
had
often
been
heard
to
declare
i
ll
never
help
a
man
who
is
too
lazy
to
help
himself
what
does
that
leonard
smith
do
to
earn
his
living
he
works
at
the
logs
about
half
the
time
and
the
balance
he
spends
in
visiting
me
i
have
often
told
him
to
go
to
work
but
he
won
t
do
it
he
is
a
sort
of
second
cousin
to
me
but
all
the
same
he
has
no
claim
on
when
leon
came
into
the
parlor
smith
turned
his
head
and
saw
him
with
more
strength
than
a
person
of
his
injuries
would
be
likely
to
show
he
thrust
out
his
hand
and
welcomed
him
in
his
cheery
way
why
leon
where
have
you
been
exclaimed
the
wounded
man
come
here
and
tell
me
all
about
it
now
doctor
i
can
get
along
without
any
more
help
until
i
get
through
with
leon
take
everybody
out
of
the
the
only
person
in
the
room
besides
the
doctor
and
leon
was
this
leonard
smith
and
he
didn
t
seem
inclined
to
move
he
walked
back
toward
the
foot
of
the
sofa
and
leaned
upon
it
and
there
he
seemed
determined
to
stay
i
want
you
to
go
too
said
smith
in
angry
tones
take
him
out
with
you
i
guess
i
had
better
stay
here
said
leonard
you
might
want
me
to
hand
you
your
water
or
i
reckon
this
man
i
have
got
here
is
enough
to
hand
me
my
water
or
anything
else
retorted
smith
doctor
i
want
to
see
leon
about
something
particular
and
i
would
thank
you
to
take
that
fellow
out
of
the
room
i
haven
t
got
but
a
short
time
to
come
now
leonard
go
out
of
the
room
said
the
doctor
leonard
waited
a
moment
just
long
enough
to
cast
a
glance
of
mingled
hate
and
rage
upon
smith
and
leon
and
then
went
out
banging
the
door
after
him
that
s
all
right
said
smith
now
lock
the
door
it
will
take
not
more
than
a
minute
but
what
little
i
do
say
i
want
to
reach
your
ears
and
your
ears
alone
pull
up
a
chair
and
sit
leon
complied
he
fastened
the
door
and
then
drew
a
chair
close
to
the
wounded
man
s
side
and
leaned
over
him
chapter
xvii
the
events
of
a
week
that
s
all
right
repeated
smith
as
leon
seated
himself
close
by
his
side
i
didn
t
want
that
leonard
smith
to
hear
a
word
i
had
to
say
to
you
for
he
is
a
slippery
fellow
and
i
don
t
deny
that
i
have
detected
him
in
efforts
to
steal
money
from
me
the
funds
i
have
put
your
hand
inside
my
vest
and
pull
out
my
leon
arose
to
his
feet
and
was
about
to
comply
with
the
man
s
request
when
the
door
of
the
parlor
was
tried
with
a
careful
hand
but
the
lock
prevented
intrusion
that
s
leonard
said
smith
let
him
work
he
has
got
rid
of
the
doctor
and
was
coming
in
to
hear
what
i
had
to
say
to
you
that
s
it
he
continued
as
leon
drew
out
a
which
was
made
so
large
that
it
would
contain
bills
at
full
length
now
put
it
in
your
pocket
and
button
it
up
and
give
it
to
your
father
the
first
thing
you
do
my
will
is
in
there
and
my
money
is
all
bequeathed
to
leon
gasped
but
he
had
never
thought
of
anything
like
this
and
he
didn
t
know
what
to
say
to
it
finally
he
stammered
do
you
think
it
right
smith
to
take
all
this
money
away
from
leonard
and
give
it
to
me
i
have
a
right
to
do
what
i
please
with
my
own
interrupted
smith
i
have
worked
hard
for
every
cent
of
it
and
i
have
made
it
all
the
money
is
all
in
gold
and
the
will
tells
where
to
find
it
but
don
t
you
let
leonard
get
hold
of
the
for
if
you
do
he
will
cheat
you
out
of
it
keep
watch
of
him
the
first
thing
you
do
and
don
t
let
him
catch
you
off
your
guard
now
leon
that
s
all
hand
me
a
drink
of
water
this
fever
or
something
else
in
me
is
burning
me
leon
made
all
haste
to
bring
the
wounded
man
a
tumbler
of
water
from
the
table
and
when
he
had
drained
it
he
thought
it
wise
to
provide
for
the
use
of
the
money
in
case
smith
s
injuries
should
not
be
as
severe
as
they
thought
of
course
if
you
get
well
he
began
why
then
of
course
i
ll
get
the
money
back
i
understand
that
but
leon
you
don
t
want
to
talk
about
such
things
i
know
when
i
am
done
for
as
well
as
anybody
now
you
may
unlock
the
door
and
let
leonard
in
after
that
take
the
money
up
and
give
it
to
your
father
it
is
all
willed
to
you
mind
you
but
of
course
your
father
will
have
full
charge
of
it
until
you
are
now
unlock
the
leon
lingered
a
moment
something
told
him
that
he
would
not
see
smith
alive
again
and
he
wanted
to
bid
him
but
he
didn
t
know
how
to
go
about
it
the
wounded
man
was
getting
impatient
so
he
stepped
up
and
shook
him
by
the
hand
after
that
he
unlocked
the
door
and
he
unlocked
it
so
suddenly
that
it
came
open
with
a
jerk
and
leonard
smith
who
was
leaning
over
with
his
ear
close
to
the
in
the
hope
of
hearing
something
that
would
be
of
use
to
him
came
into
the
parlor
on
he
didn
t
apologize
for
his
abrupt
entrance
and
neither
did
leon
for
letting
him
into
the
room
so
suddenly
while
smith
looked
the
disgust
he
could
not
express
in
words
if
i
were
in
that
man
s
place
i
should
feel
so
ashamed
of
myself
that
i
couldn
t
look
smith
in
the
face
said
leon
as
he
bounded
up
the
stairs
that
led
to
the
president
s
room
but
i
suppose
he
has
been
caught
in
so
many
tricks
that
he
isn
t
ashamed
of
anything
father
he
added
in
a
whisper
this
is
what
smith
wanted
to
see
me
about
this
has
got
his
will
in
it
and
tells
us
where
to
find
his
money
how
much
of
it
there
is
i
don
t
know
but
he
wanted
me
to
give
it
into
your
hands
with
instructions
to
look
out
for
leonard
ah
said
sprague
taking
the
and
slipping
it
inside
his
vest
so
leonard
has
got
onto
it
in
some
way
or
another
has
he
yes
and
it
was
all
smith
could
do
to
get
him
out
of
the
parlor
when
he
wanted
to
talk
to
me
he
says
don
t
you
let
leonard
catch
you
off
your
guard
one
instant
for
if
you
do
he
will
cheat
you
out
of
why
if
the
money
is
made
over
to
you
i
don
t
see
what
leonard
can
have
to
do
with
but
he
will
find
out
where
the
money
is
hidden
and
go
there
and
dig
it
well
i
reckon
leonard
won
t
get
it
now
said
sprague
buttoning
his
vest
no
i
don
t
think
he
will
now
hadn
t
you
better
go
down
and
see
smith
he
thinks
he
isn
t
going
to
last
much
i
will
go
down
and
see
him
now
i
hope
he
will
get
well
so
that
he
can
have
this
money
back
sprague
laid
down
his
pen
and
got
upon
his
feet
and
just
then
there
was
a
rumble
of
wagons
in
front
of
the
house
which
told
them
that
some
of
the
wounded
had
arrived
leon
went
down
to
assist
them
and
to
look
for
ballard
whom
he
wanted
to
introduce
to
the
president
while
his
father
went
on
to
the
parlor
leon
found
that
there
were
four
of
wounded
rebels
there
and
while
he
was
looking
around
watching
for
a
chance
to
lend
a
hand
his
father
came
to
the
door
and
beckoned
to
him
he
has
gone
said
he
when
leon
approached
within
speaking
distance
is
he
dead
yes
and
all
his
pockets
are
turned
inside
leon
followed
his
father
into
the
parlor
and
they
found
no
one
there
except
the
doctor
and
leonard
smith
the
doctor
shook
his
head
and
turned
and
went
out
while
leonard
stood
in
his
accustomed
place
at
the
foot
of
the
sofa
and
did
nothing
but
glare
at
the
father
and
son
the
pockets
had
evidently
been
searched
and
leonard
did
not
have
time
to
put
them
back
again
before
the
doctor
came
in
leon
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
when
he
saw
how
mad
leonard
was
he
had
arrived
home
just
in
the
nick
of
time
if
he
had
delayed
his
coming
half
an
hour
the
would
now
be
in
the
possession
of
one
whom
smith
did
not
want
to
have
it
but
it
was
plain
leonard
did
not
intend
to
give
it
up
in
this
way
as
leon
took
hold
of
the
sheet
to
spread
it
reverently
over
the
dead
man
s
face
leonard
suddenly
aroused
himself
and
seemed
determined
to
find
out
where
the
was
i
would
thank
you
to
give
up
what
you
got
from
him
when
i
went
out
said
he
and
he
was
so
angry
that
he
could
scarcely
form
the
words
into
a
sentence
what
did
i
get
inquired
leon
while
his
father
straightened
up
and
looked
at
him
without
speaking
you
got
a
or
something
else
in
which
he
kept
his
will
said
leonard
that
is
mine
and
i
am
bound
to
have
it
s
safe
replied
sprague
i
ll
tell
you
what
i
will
do
in
order
to
find
out
whether
it
is
in
the
possession
of
the
one
who
ought
to
have
it
as
soon
as
these
troubles
are
all
over
i
will
take
out
the
will
and
read
it
in
the
presence
of
the
but
i
don
t
intend
to
remain
out
of
my
money
so
long
interrupted
leonard
some
of
these
rebels
might
come
here
and
dig
down
and
find
it
if
i
have
it
now
it
will
be
how
do
you
know
it
is
in
the
ground
well
i
just
suppose
it
is
i
don
t
know
any
other
place
he
could
put
it
where
it
would
be
equally
i
told
you
that
i
would
read
the
will
in
the
presence
of
the
men
and
let
them
decide
who
owns
the
money
more
than
that
i
can
not
now
i
will
just
tell
you
what
s
the
gospel
truth
said
leonard
leaving
his
place
at
the
foot
of
the
sofa
and
striding
up
and
shaking
both
his
clinched
hands
in
sprague
s
face
put
down
your
hands
or
i
will
have
you
arrested
in
a
minute
said
sprague
not
in
the
least
alarmed
by
the
other
s
threatening
manner
i
will
shake
my
fists
in
your
face
or
in
anybody
else
s
face
who
intends
to
rob
me
of
my
birthright
exclaimed
leonard
at
the
same
time
allowing
his
hands
to
fall
by
his
side
i
tell
you
that
i
will
camp
on
that
place
every
night
and
woe
be
to
the
man
or
boy
who
comes
there
after
that
money
he
will
not
get
away
with
i
hope
you
have
said
enough
in
the
presence
of
this
dead
he
was
my
cousin
that
is
what
he
was
shouted
leonard
this
dead
man
to
make
you
ashamed
of
yourself
said
sprague
now
we
will
go
but
i
want
you
to
understand
what
i
said
about
camping
on
that
place
said
leonard
the
man
or
boy
who
gets
that
money
don
t
get
away
with
sprague
and
leon
went
out
without
making
any
reply
the
former
going
back
to
the
president
s
room
to
resume
his
work
upon
the
paroles
and
his
son
to
wander
aimlessly
about
with
no
disposition
to
do
any
work
although
he
saw
plenty
of
it
before
him
after
awhile
he
found
tom
howe
and
both
his
friends
with
him
they
were
tired
of
removing
wounded
rebels
and
were
now
going
up
to
tom
s
camp
for
a
good
nap
ballard
was
evidently
much
impressed
with
the
the
union
men
had
done
and
declared
that
he
had
never
seen
the
beat
i
don
t
see
how
any
of
our
fellows
came
out
alive
said
he
and
his
astonishment
was
so
great
that
he
threw
his
arms
about
his
head
you
union
men
are
dead
shots
well
there
are
plenty
of
deer
and
bear
loose
in
the
swamps
and
squirrels
in
abundance
said
leon
and
you
can
t
expect
that
men
who
sometimes
have
to
depend
on
them
for
a
living
will
miss
them
every
come
on
leon
said
dawson
you
ll
have
to
go
up
to
tom
s
camp
too
we
haven
t
heard
your
story
leon
began
his
story
as
they
walked
along
and
as
he
did
not
have
very
much
to
tell
anyway
his
companions
knew
all
about
it
by
the
time
they
got
to
the
place
where
tom
had
left
his
mule
tom
was
disgusted
when
leon
told
him
about
his
being
captured
by
one
man
and
more
than
all
by
such
a
man
as
dan
newman
but
he
was
elated
just
as
much
when
leon
told
how
ballard
had
taken
him
into
the
woods
and
given
him
something
to
eat
howdy
ballard
said
tom
walking
up
and
shaking
the
texas
rebel
by
the
hand
i
didn
t
get
a
chance
to
shake
hands
with
you
before
but
now
i
am
glad
to
see
you
that
boy
is
a
friend
of
mine
and
if
you
do
anything
for
him
it
is
as
though
you
did
it
for
me
now
we
will
take
some
supper
and
then
go
to
while
tom
was
kindling
the
fire
leon
related
to
him
the
particulars
of
smith
s
death
and
to
say
that
tom
felt
quite
as
badly
as
leon
did
would
be
telling
nothing
but
the
truth
he
did
not
say
anything
about
the
will
which
he
had
given
into
his
father
s
care
or
about
the
trouble
that
leonard
smith
had
threatened
to
make
on
account
of
it
for
something
told
him
that
he
had
better
keep
that
to
himself
thus
far
he
and
sprague
were
the
only
ones
that
knew
anything
about
it
of
course
he
would
have
been
perfectly
willing
to
have
trusted
tom
with
his
secret
but
there
were
other
men
there
ballard
and
dawson
of
whom
he
knew
nothing
how
did
he
know
that
they
would
not
hunt
for
the
money
and
make
off
with
it
it
was
hidden
in
the
ground
somewhere
leonard
seemed
to
think
that
that
was
the
place
he
would
go
to
find
it
and
if
he
told
everybody
of
it
they
would
dig
smith
s
farm
full
of
holes
but
that
they
would
find
it
i
don
t
think
i
had
better
say
anything
about
that
said
leon
to
himself
after
he
had
thought
the
matter
over
i
will
talk
about
it
to
father
the
first
chance
i
get
these
men
will
all
be
poor
when
this
war
is
settled
and
they
may
fight
about
the
money
as
readily
as
they
fired
into
that
regiment
of
during
the
week
following
there
was
nothing
happened
that
would
be
of
interest
to
you
although
it
was
full
of
interest
to
the
union
men
of
jones
county
in
the
first
place
as
soon
as
they
had
eaten
breakfast
the
prisoners
who
had
been
captured
the
day
before
were
summoned
to
the
hotel
and
there
signed
their
paroles
they
did
it
too
knowing
full
well
what
was
to
be
expected
if
they
didn
t
keep
them
for
knight
was
there
and
he
went
over
the
same
speech
he
had
delivered
to
the
captain
in
his
room
there
were
a
number
of
wagons
and
the
wounded
were
placed
carefully
in
them
and
they
were
to
be
taken
away
and
delivered
to
their
friends
there
were
also
two
hundred
union
men
with
them
who
were
to
guard
them
as
far
as
the
bridge
and
then
they
were
to
bid
them
and
come
back
i
hope
said
knight
after
he
had
got
through
with
his
speech
that
you
all
have
been
treated
right
since
you
have
been
oh
yes
sir
responded
a
dozen
voices
you
have
treated
us
like
we
were
your
then
i
hope
that
if
you
get
any
of
my
boys
in
the
confederate
lines
you
will
treat
them
in
the
same
way
that
s
all
go
knight
did
not
raise
any
objections
when
the
men
took
off
their
hats
and
gave
him
a
cheer
he
simply
bowed
and
went
up
the
stairs
that
led
to
his
room
the
next
thing
was
taking
smith
and
bach
noble
and
several
other
men
who
had
been
killed
and
wounded
during
the
fight
with
the
cavalry
to
their
homes
it
was
done
with
rather
more
of
solemnity
than
had
yet
been
displayed
and
a
long
line
followed
after
each
man
who
had
given
up
his
life
in
defence
of
the
flag
sprague
and
leon
went
with
the
man
who
had
bequeathed
them
all
he
had
in
this
world
to
give
and
saw
a
grave
dug
where
he
had
always
said
he
would
wish
to
be
laid
and
when
the
ceremony
was
over
they
came
back
to
the
hotel
very
much
depressed
in
spirits
and
it
was
a
long
time
before
they
got
over
thinking
about
smith
he
was
so
lively
and
full
of
fun
that
he
was
sadly
missed
but
it
was
not
long
before
something
else
demanded
their
attention
there
was
one
thing
that
leon
was
glad
to
see
leonard
smith
was
not
present
at
the
funeral
it
was
not
the
man
he
cared
was
the
money
he
thought
he
had
laid
away
and
which
he
believed
he
was
in
duty
bound
to
get
seeing
that
smith
had
no
one
else
to
bestow
it
upon
but
he
saw
that
he
was
not
likely
to
get
it
by
fair
means
and
so
he
kept
out
of
the
way
there
was
another
thing
that
happened
during
the
week
that
made
the
union
men
draw
a
long
breath
of
relief
the
boats
which
that
squad
had
been
sent
up
to
build
were
all
done
and
now
it
needed
nothing
but
a
strong
force
of
confederates
much
too
large
to
be
handled
by
them
to
send
the
last
man
of
them
over
to
the
island
where
they
would
be
comparatively
safe
they
were
now
ready
to
fight
and
they
didn
t
care
how
soon
it
was
forced
upon
them
during
that
week
too
a
large
number
of
men
probably
two
hundred
of
them
in
all
came
in
to
give
themselves
up
some
of
them
were
on
foot
and
others
had
their
wagons
along
loaded
with
their
families
and
household
furniture
they
had
heard
the
particulars
of
the
capture
of
that
and
believing
that
the
men
in
jones
county
were
in
earnest
and
that
they
did
not
intend
to
be
forced
into
the
rebel
army
they
watched
their
opportunity
and
came
in
by
night
and
this
wasn
t
the
worst
of
it
there
were
more
came
in
every
day
until
leon
wondered
where
they
should
get
food
for
them
all
i
don
t
think
the
rebels
knew
how
many
fighting
men
there
were
about
here
said
he
we
must
have
as
many
as
hundred
men
yes
and
i
guess
if
you
had
said
double
that
you
wouldn
t
have
been
far
out
of
the
way
said
ballard
who
stuck
close
to
the
boys
wherever
they
went
it
will
take
ten
thousand
men
to
whip
do
you
suppose
that
jeff
davis
can
send
that
number
of
men
up
here
we
are
only
one
little
part
of
the
confederacy
and
i
should
think
he
would
want
to
save
his
men
for
something
he
may
now
but
he
won
t
after
a
while
when
mobile
becomes
surrounded
by
union
troops
as
she
certainly
will
he
will
need
all
the
men
he
can
and
there
was
one
other
thing
that
happened
during
this
week
that
caused
leon
and
tom
to
look
at
each
other
in
perfect
astonishment
it
proved
that
the
chief
men
of
the
county
although
they
might
act
so
very
innocent
were
not
to
be
taken
unawares
they
had
spies
out
some
of
them
went
to
mobile
to
see
what
they
could
find
there
that
was
worth
looking
at
especially
to
keep
track
of
that
strong
force
which
they
knew
would
be
sent
against
them
sooner
or
later
and
the
others
went
up
into
the
interior
of
the
state
to
keep
a
lookout
for
some
more
these
men
took
their
lives
in
their
hands
for
every
one
of
them
that
went
into
the
confederate
lines
was
dressed
in
a
rebel
uniform
if
they
were
caught
and
could
not
make
a
good
excuse
in
regard
to
the
regiment
and
company
they
belonged
to
they
would
be
hanged
leon
had
been
so
very
busy
ever
since
he
came
into
camp
that
he
had
not
had
time
to
learn
all
these
things
but
there
was
one
other
thing
that
he
did
learn
which
afforded
him
infinite
gratification
it
was
what
happened
to
newman
and
family
they
had
been
arrested
as
soon
as
sprague
found
out
or
rather
mistrusted
that
one
of
their
number
could
tell
more
about
leon
s
absence
than
any
one
else
and
bass
kennedy
s
corn
being
thrown
out
of
the
calaboose
they
were
chucked
in
there
and
guards
placed
over
them
to
be
sure
that
they
stayed
too
of
course
sprague
was
very
much
astonished
when
he
learned
that
dan
had
made
a
prisoner
of
leon
and
had
been
wounded
and
captured
by
the
pickets
and
when
he
was
brought
to
ellisville
he
had
him
put
into
the
jail
with
his
father
and
mother
on
the
morning
that
the
prisoners
were
sent
away
they
were
given
a
wagon
to
themselves
and
forwarded
to
the
rebels
in
mobile
and
leon
never
heard
of
them
afterward
we
may
tell
you
however
that
dan
s
arm
was
amputated
when
he
got
among
the
doctors
and
cale
never
recovered
his
good
looks
he
looked
as
if
his
jaws
were
sunk
in
and
all
the
he
could
get
in
them
would
not
make
them
look
any
different
by
this
time
everything
had
been
got
ready
for
the
visit
of
that
force
which
was
to
crush
out
the
rebellion
of
the
confederacy
we
don
t
say
that
sprague
and
the
other
chief
men
looked
upon
it
as
boys
play
because
they
knew
well
enough
what
it
meant
the
actions
of
the
regiment
of
cavalry
which
came
in
there
as
well
as
the
threats
they

made
that
they
were
going
to
sweep
everything
clean

that
before

showed
them
that
they
couldn
t
hope
for
any
mercy
the
head
men
of
the
confederacy
would

sprague
talked
this
all
over
with
leon
but
the
latter
did
not
exhibit
any
signs
of
wavering
well
i
suppose
if
that
is
what
we
have
got
to
contend
with
we
can
t
meet
it
any
too
soon
said
leon
compressing
his
mouth
firmly
as
he
always
did
whenever
his
courage
was
tested
to
the
utmost
i
never
thought
that
this
thing
was
coming
through
all
right
such
an
exploit
was
never
thought
of
i
know
it
and
that
is
what
makes
us
think
we
shall
come
through
with
flying
colors
there
s
one
thing
about
it
we
won
t
fight
against
our
old
in
spite
of
all
the
constant
work
there
was
for
him
to
do
at
headquarters
sprague
found
opportunity
to
go
home
and
assist
his
wife
in
packing
up
for
the
island
which
was
the
place
the
backwoodsmen
had
decided
upon
to
make
their
last
stand
it
was
a
piece
of
ground
in
the
midst
of
the
swamp
entirely
surrounded
by
water
and
now
that
the
inside
of
it
had
been
cleared
of
all
underbrush
which
had
been
piled
around
the
outside
of
it
to
answer
for
a
breastwork
the
island
seemed
to
be
a
larger
camp
than
the
force
of
men
at
their
disposal
needed
leon
went
up
and
saw
it
he
took
his
mother
over
in
one
of
the
boats
making
their
stock
swim
behind
and
through
a
long
winding
pathway
made
of
corduroy
logs
and
obstructed
at
every
turn
by
numerous
barricades
and
when
he
came
at
last
into
the
cleared
space
he
was
astonished
why
father
we
haven
t
got
men
enough
to
fill
up
that
space
said
he
there
s
room
enough
for
ten
thousand
don
t
worry
yourself
said
his
father
with
a
smile
this
war
is
not
half
over
yet
by
the
time
we
have
our
first
fight
here
we
ll
have
more
men
than
we
we
must
not
forget
to
say
that
tom
howe
s
mother
and
giddings
and
his
family
went
with
them
they
all
settled
right
down
close
together
and
seemed
as
happy
and
contented
there
as
they
would
have
been
under
their
own
roofs
giddings
especially
was
the
source
of
constant
merriment
to
the
boys
it
didn
t
make
any
difference
to
him
that
he
was
so
far
from
his
mountain
home
but
he
pitched
right
in
and
had
a
good
time
of
course
he
was
careful
of
his
rifle
whenever
he
could
get
his
hands
upon
that
he
seemed
to
throw
care
to
the
winds
it
was
on
this
very
day
that
sprague
thought
it
best
to
speak
to
leon
about
that
will
the
boy
didn
t
know
anything
about
it
and
if
anything
happened
to
him
during
the
fights
that
followed
he
wanted
leon
to
know
where
to
get
the
money
sprague
in
the
presence
of
his
wife
had
examined
the
will
a
few
days
before
and
the
result
almost
took
his
breath
away
there
were
a
few
in
the
perhaps
a
hundred
dollars
or
two
and
a
few
bills
payable
but
they
were
all
marked
off
as
if
to
show
sprague
that
smith
did
not
want
to
press
the
men
for
the
money
among
these
bills
was
the
will
and
when
sprague
came
to
examine
it
his
hand
shook
and
he
passed
it
over
to
his
wife
saying
my
goodness
mary
who
would
have
supposed
that
smith
was
worth
so
much
money
we
dare
not
say
anything
about
this
for
if
we
do
our
lives
will
not
be
worth
a
moment
s
purchase
these
men
around
us
will
fight
as
hard
to
keep
the
money
here
as
they
will
to
keep
the
rebels
away
now
what
had
we
better
do
chapter
xviii
coleman
proves
his
honesty
sprague
fastened
her
eyes
on
the
document
and
as
she
read
the
color
all
left
her
face
she
looked
around
there
was
plenty
of
opportunity
for
her
to
be
overheard
now
for
they
were
living
in
a
brush
and
there
were
people
constantly
passing
back
and
forth
almost
within
reach
of
them
there
were
plenty
of
folks
there
that
could
be
trusted
with
their
secret
but
there
were
lots
more
from
whom
it
must
be
kept
at
all
hazards
and
do
you
think
that
some
of
these
people
will
fight
for
this
money
she
said
in
an
earnest
whisper
there
are
lots
of
them
that
will
do
it
returned
her
husband
you
see
we
will
be
as
poor
as
they
make
them
when
this
thing
is
ended
and
where
they
are
going
to
get
money
to
start
on
i
don
t
know
i
tell
you
we
mustn
t
let
anybody
know
it
put
that
away
and
i
will
go
out
and
call
the
heir
of
all
this
wealth
was
found
assisting
giddings
who
was
just
putting
the
finishing
touches
on
his
brush
shanty
preparatory
to
getting
his
family
under
it
he
looked
up
when
he
saw
his
father
approaching
and
he
had
never
seen
him
look
so
white
before
but
he
was
warned
by
the
signal
his
father
made
him
and
so
he
didn
t
say
a
word
his
mother
handed
him
the
will
when
he
entered
their
brush
and
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
it
leon
was
master
of
its
contents
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
he
gasped
sh
not
so
loud
cautioned
his
mother
you
don
t
want
everybody
to
know
it
do
you
sit
down
here
and
tell
us
what
you
think
of
to
think
that
old
smith
who
went
about
with
his
knees
and
elbows
out
should
be
worth
so
much
money
said
leon
it
is
no
wonder
that
that
fellow
wanted
to
fight
for
yes
and
you
must
be
careful
what
you
say
around
where
he
can
hear
it
said
his
father
who
had
taken
up
a
position
in
the
door
of
the
so
that
he
could
partially
screen
leon
while
reading
the
will
if
he
finds
out
where
that
money
is
hid
it
s
all
up
with
but
he
won
t
find
it
said
leon
who
quickly
copied
after
his
father
and
spoke
in
an
almost
inaudible
whisper
he
has
got
it
hidden
in
the
i
was
there
while
he
was
laying
that
floor
along
in
the
early
part
of
the
war
and
he
said
then
that
i
might
some
day
dig
up
something
under
it
i
couldn
t
think
then
what
he
meant
although
i
know
it
well
you
had
better
let
your
mother
take
care
of
the
will
said
sprague
and
then
if
anything
happens
to
us
she
will
know
right
where
to
go
and
get
the
money
i
tell
you
that
is
a
good
deal
more
than
we
thought
we
were
going
to
leon
was
almost
overwhelmed
by
the
result
of
the
last
few
minutes
and
if
he
could
have
had
his
own
way
he
would
have
been
glad
to
get
off
somewhere
by
himself
and
think
the
matter
over
but
now
it
was
impossible
everywhere
he
went
there
was
somebody
around
and
it
seemed
to
leon
now
that
he
thought
about
it
that
those
who
knew
about
smith
s
will
had
a
way
of
looking
at
him
as
though
they
knew
the
secrets
of
what
was
hidden
under
the
of
course
it
was
all
imagination
on
his
part
but
still
he
wanted
to
get
away
and
talk
the
matter
over
with
tom
howe
mustn
t
i
take
anybody
into
my
confidence
at
all
not
even
tom
said
he
take
nobody
into
your
confidence
said
his
father
earnestly
you
don
t
know
what
sort
of
a
fellow
tom
is
he
may
be
all
right
to
have
around
where
there
s
a
jam
of
logs
in
the
river
but
you
don
t
want
to
say
anything
to
him
about
this
money
well
when
are
you
going
to
get
it
we
ll
have
to
go
away
from
here
in
order
to
use
we
ll
go
to
it
after
this
war
is
settled
and
not
before
of
course
we
shall
have
to
go
away
from
here
for
we
can
t
use
it
around
where
leonard
smith
is
and
here
s
another
thing
i
want
to
tell
you
remember
and
keep
close
within
reach
of
me
and
don
t
let
smith
or
anybody
else
get
you
off
on
one
side
if
you
do
you
will
suffer
for
leon
smiled
and
wondered
what
sort
of
a
story
smith
could
make
up
to
draw
him
off
in
the
woods
and
it
wasn
t
so
very
long
before
he
found
out
ever
since
the
night
that
smith
died
leonard
had
been
he
had
no
idea
how
much
the
will
in
the
contained
but
he
was
certain
that
it
was
enough
to
keep
him
all
his
days
without
work
this
was
what
this
lazy
vagabond
was
building
his
hopes
upon
anyway
he
didn
t
want
the
spragues
to
have
it
and
what
was
more
he
was
determined
that
they
shouldn
t
if
there
was
any
way
by
which
could
get
the
will
or
any
means
to
learn
the
of
the
money
why
then
it
would
be
clear
sailing
with
him
leon
undoubtedly
had
time
to
read
the
will
and
find
out
where
the
money
was
concealed
and
if
he
could
get
him
off
by
himself
somewhere
he
would
find
out
where
that
money
was
concealed
or
he
would
leave
leon
hanging
to
a
tree
in
the
woods
it
took
him
two
days
to
come
to
this
decision
and
all
the
while
he
roamed
about
over
smith
s
place
poking
into
every
place
that
he
could
think
of
where
there
was
the
least
chance
of
hiding
money
when
the
funeral
procession
came
there
he
slunk
into
the
woods
but
when
they
went
away
again
he
came
out
and
renewed
his
endeavors
to
find
the
fortune
there
is
money
hidden
somewhere
about
here
and
i
am
as
certain
of
it
as
that
i
am
alive
said
leonard
smith
when
the
men
who
had
composed
the
funeral
procession
had
gone
away
if
it
were
not
that
leon
has
the
secret
stowed
away
in
his
head
i
would
him
the
moment
i
saw
him
but
if
i
can
get
him
in
the
woods
and
make
preparations
to
hang
him
i
ll
find
out
where
the
money
is
i
can
t
do
anything
by
myself
and
i
must
have
somebody
to
help
me
now
who
shall
i
get
fortunately
it
was
an
easy
thing
for
leonard
smith
to
decide
upon
this
question
he
thought
over
all
the
worthless
fellows
who
occurred
to
his
mind
just
then
and
finally
hit
upon
one
who
was
just
about
of
as
much
use
in
the
world
as
he
was
caleb
coleman
was
on
the
island
beyond
a
was
always
around
where
he
was
certain
there
was
no
if
he
could
only
get
over
there
and
see
him
he
was
sure
that
he
could
induce
him
to
lend
a
hand
in
finding
the
money
but
the
trouble
was
he
did
not
care
to
go
around
where
leon
was
i
don
t
know
whether
that
boy
is
certain
that
i
am
looking
for
the
money
or
not
but
he
acts
as
if
he
did
said
smith
as
he
took
a
look
around
to
make
sure
that
he
had
not
missed
any
place
where
he
thought
there
was
a
chance
of
hiding
the
money
he
had
removed
every
pile
of
boards
there
was
about
the
and
had
dug
under
them
until
he
saw
that
the
earth
had
not
recently
been
disturbed
and
then
threw
the
piles
of
boards
back
again
he
had
even
been
in
the
and
plied
his
search
there
but
with
all
his
looking
he
could
not
find
any
place
which
bore
the
appearance
of
having
been
dug
over
and
he
was
almost
inclined
to
give
up
his
search
in
despair
but
he
had
one
more
trump
card
to
play
and
the
more
he
thought
of
it
the
more
confident
he
became
that
it
would
surely
work
here
s
one
thing
that
i
have
got
to
blame
old
sprague
for
said
smith
as
he
picked
up
his
ever
thought
of
going
abroad
without
a
rifle
in
war
turned
his
steps
toward
the
island
he
s
gone
and
sent
off
that
newman
family
and
if
they
were
here
i
would
know
right
where
to
go
to
find
three
good
men
to
assist
me
but
seeing
that
he
couldn
t
mind
his
own
business
i
suppose
coleman
is
the
best
one
i
can
get
i
ll
bet
i
will
make
his
eyes
open
if
i
promise
him
one
thousand
dollars
in
smith
had
not
yet
been
over
to
the
island
but
it
was
no
trouble
at
all
for
him
to
get
there
for
the
boats
were
constantly
employed
in
carrying
over
the
household
furniture
of
the
refugees
he
did
not
know
that
there
were
so
many
men
in
the
county
before
and
when
he
came
to
look
closely
at
them
he
found
that
the
most
of
them
were
strangers
a
great
many
of
them
too
were
dressed
in
rebel
uniform
and
they
worked
like
honest
men
who
were
anxious
to
take
their
families
to
a
place
of
safety
but
he
did
not
see
coleman
there
i
ll
bet
i
ll
find
him
on
the
island
laid
down
alongside
the
fire
said
smith
as
his
boat
touched
the
shore
and
he
jumped
off
you
may
be
sure
that
he
wouldn
t
do
any
work
while
there
is
anybody
to
do
it
for
smith
was
surprised
to
find
that
no
one
on
the
island
had
missed
him
for
nobody
spoke
to
him
the
majority
of
the
men
were
busy
building
their
houses
and
getting
their
household
goods
under
cover
and
well
they
might
be
after
they
got
through
here
they
were
to
march
in
a
body
down
to
the
hotel
and
meet
the
assault
of
that
force
which
was
coming
to
crush
out
the
last
vestige
of
the
confederacy
the
men
all
acted
with
a
feverish
eagerness
as
if
they
were
impatient
to
get
at
it
smith
thought
too
that
if
that
invading
force
succeeded
in
following
the
union
men
to
their
island
they
were
bound
to
be
whipped
the
passage
through
the
cane
was
long
and
winding
and
at
every
turn
there
were
barricades
erected
behind
which
three
or
four
hundred
men
could
have
resisted
a
thousand
these
breastworks
of
logs
had
been
thrown
up
by
the
party
who
came
out
to
build
the
boats
and
without
any
orders
from
headquarters
and
sprague
showed
what
he
thought
of
them
by
praising
the
men
without
stint
you
will
make
good
soldiers
some
day
said
he
the
rebels
can
t
get
in
here
any
way
they
can
fix
it
they
are
bound
to
come
in
column
when
they
assault
these
breastworks
because
the
cane
is
so
thick
that
they
can
t
come
in
any
other
way
and
before
they
can
get
in
here
they
won
t
have
a
man
there
s
one
of
them
now
muttered
smith
as
he
caught
sight
of
sprague
standing
in
the
door
of
his
if
smith
had
only
known
it
leon
was
in
the
act
of
reading
the
will
if
i
can
get
of
that
boy
of
yours
i
ll
soon
know
as
much
as
he
does
he
knows
where
the
money
is
and
he
will
tell
it
all
sooner
than
be
sprague
bowed
to
smith
as
he
passed
by
but
the
latter
didn
t
pay
any
attention
to
him
the
man
wanted
to
know
where
he
could
find
coleman
but
he
was
much
too
sharp
to
speak
to
sprague
about
it
he
kept
on
a
little
further
and
found
somebody
of
whom
he
could
make
inquiries
another
thing
that
attracted
smith
s
attention
right
here
was
the
air
of
neatness
and
order
with
which
all
the
were
arranged
they
were
laid
off
in
streets
so
that
one
could
go
the
whole
length
of
them
on
the
darkest
of
nights
without
stumbling
over
a
brush
shanty
which
contained
some
sleeping
occupants
you
will
find
caleb
up
there
on
the
outskirts
of
the
camp
said
the
man
of
whom
he
made
inquiries
he
s
got
sick
of
poleing
the
boats
over
and
so
has
gone
up
to
camp
to
lie
then
he
isn
t
doing
any
work
at
all
asked
smith
work
naw
he
says
he
hain
t
got
but
a
little
time
to
stay
with
his
folks
and
so
he
intends
to
see
them
all
he
can
when
we
go
down
there
to
meet
the
rebels
he
is
going
to
stay
in
then
he
is
just
the
man
i
want
said
smith
to
himself
as
he
pursued
his
way
toward
coleman
s
i
aint
to
meet
the
rebels
myself
and
consequently
i
don
t
blame
smith
followed
along
up
the
street
until
he
came
to
the
end
of
it
and
there
he
found
coleman
the
that
he
had
over
him
was
not
very
secure
but
coleman
didn
t
seem
to
mind
that
he
lay
stretched
out
on
the
bedding
with
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
and
three
or
four
dogs
and
as
many
children
kept
him
company
why
don
t
you
put
a
roof
on
your
asked
smith
when
it
rains
you
ll
wish
you
had
paid
more
attention
to
well
when
it
rains
i
can
t
fix
it
and
now
it
don
t
need
it
replied
coleman
with
a
laugh
it
will
why
don
t
you
get
out
and
pole
the
boats
over
oh
there
ll
be
plenty
of
men
besides
me
to
do
that
little
thing
replied
coleman
besides
i
ve
poled
some
of
them
over
until
i
am
all
tired
well
get
up
if
you
can
i
want
to
see
anything
particular
you
will
think
so
when
you
hear
it
replied
smith
impatiently
kick
some
of
those
dogs
out
of
the
way
and
come
along
with
coleman
arose
with
an
effort
laid
the
children
carefully
aside
and
followed
after
smith
who
led
the
way
around
on
the
outside
of
the
being
particular
to
keep
out
of
sight
of
sprague
at
the
other
end
of
the
street
there
he
threw
himself
down
upon
the
leaves
and
waited
for
coleman
to
join
him
sit
up
so
far
off
he
said
when
the
man
halted
at
least
five
feet
away
i
have
got
something
in
particular
that
i
want
to
say
to
you
and
i
don
t
want
anybody
to
overhear
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
mighty
friendly
now
that
the
old
man
is
dead
and
you
have
come
into
his
fortune
said
coleman
moving
up
closer
how
much
did
you
make
out
of
that
i
think
i
have
heard
you
say
that
you
wanted
as
much
as
or
thirty
thousand
that
s
what
i
said
answered
smith
frowning
fiercely
but
the
trouble
is
i
have
not
got
who
has
got
it
then
demanded
coleman
looking
surprised
that
little
snipe
leon
sprague
smith
had
no
business
to
give
it
to
him
but
he
did
and
i
am
left
out
in
the
i
say
that
s
a
pretty
ain
t
it
i
should
say
so
now
i
will
give
you
a
thousand
dollars
if
you
will
help
me
to
get
that
s
a
power
of
money
ain
t
it
but
how
can
i
help
you
by
going
to
leon
and
telling
him
that
i
want
to
see
him
in
the
woods
said
smith
sinking
his
voice
almost
to
a
whisper
if
i
once
get
him
out
there
away
from
everybody
i
will
tell
him
that
if
he
wants
to
see
daylight
again
he
can
tell
me
where
that
money
good
gracious
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
him
kill
him
smith
nodded
then
you
can
get
somebody
else
to
help
you
get
that
money
said
coleman
drawing
a
long
breath
you
won
t
get
any
help
out
of
but
think
of
the
thousand
dollars
said
smith
who
began
to
see
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
i
don
t
care
if
it
s
twice
a
thousand
dollars
i
wouldn
t
dare
show
my
face
in
jones
county
you
needn
t
come
back
to
jones
county
said
smith
who
began
to
fear
that
he
had
run
against
a
snag
when
he
least
expected
it
i
am
not
coming
back
i
am
going
over
to
the
well
there
that
s
just
what
i
expected
you
to
do
here
you
promise
to
support
this
government
and
then
go
back
on
it
the
first
chance
you
get
you
say
you
won
t
meet
the
rebels
retorted
smith
i
know
it
but
i
didn
t
say
i
was
going
over
to
them
good
land
you
can
get
somebody
else
to
help
you
said
coleman
rising
to
his
feet
that
s
a
little
too
dangerous
a
piece
of
business
for
me
if
that
s
all
you
wanted
to
say
i
ll
go
well
here
hold
on
a
minute
exclaimed
smith
who
saw
that
it
would
not
do
to
permit
coleman
to
go
back
among
his
friends
feeling
as
he
did
now
there
is
all
of
or
thirty
thousand
dollars
in
that
will
and
leon
knows
where
it
let
him
keep
it
that
s
what
i
now
suppose
instead
of
hanging
him
continued
smith
paying
no
heed
to
the
interruption
we
will
just
make
believe
to
hang
him
up
until
he
sees
stars
and
then
pull
him
down
again
we
could
do
no
we
couldn
t
leon
s
eyes
would
be
unbandaged
and
he
could
easy
see
who
pulled
him
up
i
tell
you
you
had
better
get
somebody
well
i
supposed
you
were
willing
to
work
hard
for
a
thousand
dollars
said
smith
in
disgust
but
you
are
willing
to
live
along
just
as
you
are
now
without
any
thought
for
the
morrow
thank
goodness
there
are
plenty
of
men
in
this
party
who
will
help
then
you
had
better
get
one
of
you
won
t
say
anything
about
what
i
have
told
you
never
a
word
only
don
t
mention
it
to
me
again
i
would
rather
be
poor
all
my
life
than
make
a
living
in
that
dishonest
say
coleman
sit
down
here
a
minute
i
want
to
whisper
something
to
the
man
was
a
long
time
in
sitting
down
he
seemed
to
think
that
smith
had
some
other
terms
to
disclose
which
would
lead
him
into
his
scheme
whether
he
wanted
to
or
not
i
will
give
you
five
thousand
dollars
said
smith
in
an
earnest
undertone
just
think
of
that
here
you
will
be
as
poor
as
job
s
turkey
and
that
amount
of
money
will
easily
set
you
on
your
i
don
t
care
if
it
s
ten
thousand
i
won
t
do
well
coleman
i
was
only
just
fooling
you
said
smith
and
in
order
to
give
color
to
his
words
he
leaned
back
and
laughed
heartily
you
will
do
to
tie
yes
said
coleman
and
he
laughed
too
but
it
was
a
different
sort
of
laugh
you
have
an
awful
funny
way
of
fooling
a
fellow
i
must
say
if
you
were
not
in
earnest
when
you
sat
down
here
i
shall
miss
my
coleman
got
upon
his
feet
again
and
smith
was
so
angry
that
he
let
him
go
without
compelling
him
to
promise
over
again
that
he
would
not
tell
anybody
of
the
scheme
that
had
been
proposed
to
him
he
laid
down
on
his
bed
and
filled
his
pipe
but
he
rolled
over
to
see
where
smith
went
that
fellow
is
to
get
himself
in
a
power
of
disturbance
the
first
thing
he
knows
said
he
to
his
wife
as
he
saw
smith
moving
down
toward
sprague
s
end
of
the
street
he
is
fixing
himself
to
get
good
land
how
is
that
exclaimed
the
woman
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
had
promised
smith
that
he
would
not
say
a
word
about
it
it
did
not
take
coleman
long
to
go
over
his
interview
with
him
and
when
he
told
of
the
amount
of
money
that
had
been
offered
him
his
wife
fairly
gasped
for
breath
i
know
that
is
a
big
sum
continued
coleman
but
just
think
of
the
danger
there
will
be
if
leon
gets
off
in
the
woods
and
don
t
come
back
they
will
hunt
high
and
low
for
him
and
it
won
t
take
them
long
to
determine
who
it
was
that
had
a
hand
in
his
taking
off
if
they
they
were
going
to
hang
him
why
of
course
he
will
know
who
it
was
and
he
ll
tell
of
it
when
he
comes
back
i
think
i
was
pretty
smart
in
keeping
out
of
it
there
goes
smith
off
toward
the
boats
now
i
believe
i
ll
go
and
see
smith
had
evidently
missed
his
guess
by
a
long
ways
when
he
selected
coleman
to
assist
him
he
had
never
known
anything
against
this
man
s
honesty
he
supposed
of
course
that
a
fellow
who
hated
to
work
as
bad
as
he
did
and
who
was
content
to
lay
around
home
all
the
time
in
company
with
the
dogs
and
the
children
in
preference
to
handling
an
axe
ought
to
be
willing
to
engage
in
anything
that
he
thought
would
bring
him
money
but
as
it
happened
there
were
some
honest
men
in
that
party
although
they
did
wear
ragged
jackets
without
further
thought
coleman
arose
and
sauntered
off
toward
sprague
s
end
of
the
street
and
when
he
came
opposite
their
he
found
the
boy
he
wanted
to
see
talking
with
his
mother
well
caleb
what
can
i
do
for
you
asked
sprague
who
still
occupied
his
old
position
in
the
door
of
the
not
a
thing
replied
coleman
but
i
want
to
see
leon
for
about
five
do
you
want
him
to
go
out
in
the
woods
with
you
said
sprague
with
a
wink
that
spoke
volumes
eh
no
but
i
want
to
tell
him
to
keep
away
from
the
woods
replied
coleman
who
wondered
if
sprague
knew
all
about
it
well
you
might
just
as
well
come
in
here
and
tell
it
said
sprague
taking
coleman
by
the
arm
there
are
no
secrets
between
coleman
went
and
in
a
few
minutes
was
seated
on
a
trunk
revealing
the
scheme
that
had
been
proposed
to
him
leon
and
his
father
exchanged
significant
glances
and
the
boy
thought
how
wise
sprague
had
been
when
he
advised
him
to
stick
closely
by
his
side
and
to
let
nothing
draw
him
away
i
did
say
that
i
wouldn
t
tell
this
to
anybody
said
coleman
in
conclusion
and
i
won
t
tell
it
to
any
one
except
who
are
so
deeply
interested
in
it
you
won
t
tell
on
me
did
he
say
how
much
he
was
going
to
get
asked
leon
after
his
father
had
made
the
required
promise
coleman
replied
that
he
thought
he
was
going
to
get
or
thirty
thousand
dollars
and
this
proved
that
smith
did
not
know
anything
of
the
value
of
the
deceased
man
s
legacy
that
s
a
heap
of
money
said
leon
and
now
coleman
i
ll
tell
you
what
we
will
do
with
you
if
you
will
stay
around
with
smith
and
learn
all
you
can
in
regard
to
his
plans
you
shall
not
lose
anything
by
it
i
want
to
find
out
if
he
gets
somebody
else
to
assist
coleman
promised
and
having
had
his
talk
out
went
away
i
can
easily
give
him
a
thousand
dollars
to
pay
him
for
the
trouble
he
has
taken
said
leon
but
you
must
remember
that
you
haven
t
got
the
money
yet
said
his
father
oh
i
know
i
shall
have
some
trouble
in
getting
it
said
leon
while
that
firm
expression
settled
about
his
mouth
when
this
trouble
is
over
that
fellow
is
going
to
camp
on
the
place
and
just
as
likely
as
not
he
will
shoot
down
everybody
who
goes
anywhere
near
the
leon
i
am
afraid
to
have
you
go
there
said
sprague
but
think
of
the
money
i
tell
you
that
will
set
us
up
then
i
can
get
an
education
that
s
one
thing
i
will
never
have
if
i
stay
down
the
matter
was
settled
for
the
time
being
by
sprague
s
putting
the
will
into
her
bosom
and
pinning
it
fast
then
leon
went
out
and
mingled
with
his
but
his
feelings
were
very
different
from
those
which
he
had
experienced
when
he
followed
his
father
into
the
when
he
came
to
think
of
what
the
will
bequeathed
him
it
fairly
took
his
breath
away
it
would
get
them
a
little
home
somewhere
his
mother
would
be
obliged
to
do
no
more
work
and
better
than
all
he
would
have
money
enough
left
to
send
him
to
school
well
leon
you
seem
to
be
particularly
happy
and
so
am
i
said
giddings
as
he
took
his
seat
near
the
door
of
his
pulled
off
his
hat
and
wiped
the
big
drops
of
perspiration
from
his
forehead
or
rather
i
should
be
happy
if
my
brothers
were
out
of
prison
i
expect
they
have
been
executed
by
this
if
i
thought
that
it
would
make
me
shoot
to
kill
said
leon
oh
won
t
i
when
i
get
the
chance
replied
giddings
with
so
much
excitement
that
leon
was
glad
he
was
not
a
rebel
i
am
waiting
for
the
colonel
to
say
the
word
and
get
me
down
there
where
i
will
have
full
swing
at
them
and
then
every
one
that
i
pull
on
goes
up
i
tell
you
you
don
t
know
anything
about
rebellion
down
this
started
giddings
on
his
favorite
subject
of
conversation
and
leon
sat
there
and
listened
to
him
until
they
were
called
to
supper
chapter
xix
conclusion
but
two
adventures
remain
to
be
told
regarding
leon
sprague
s
life
as
a
jones
county
confederate
soldier
one
was
the
first
real
fight
in
which
he
bore
a
part
though
to
tell
the
truth
he
didn
t
remember
much
about
it
and
the
other
the
exploit
he
went
through
in
getting
the
money
that
had
been
bequeathed
to
him
it
took
one
hundred
men
to
guard
the
island
and
although
there
was
no
necessity
for
having
this
number
of
men
out
the
colonel
thought
it
best
to
be
on
the
safe
side
he
selected
the
men
posted
them
himself
and
sat
up
nearly
all
night
to
make
sure
that
they
were
doing
their
duty
at
the
first
peep
of
day
the
men
were
all
aroused
and
having
had
breakfast
were
getting
ready
to
march
down
to
the
hotel
how
leon
s
eyes
opened
when
he
saw
the
men
all
in
line
after
they
had
got
across
the
stream
his
father
said
that
there
were
at
least
three
thousand
of
to
whip
four
times
their
number
of
rebels
if
they
were
brought
against
them
they
were
going
back
to
the
hotel
because
it
was
the
first
point
that
the
rebels
would
strike
in
jones
county
and
more
than
that
they
had
things
very
neatly
fixed
there
for
the
reception
of
any
body
of
men
who
might
be
brought
against
them
a
long
line
of
breastworks
extended
across
the
edge
of
the
woods
one
side
being
flanked
by
a
deep
swamp
and
the
other
by
the
river
so
it
was
impossible
to
get
behind
them
they
calculated
to
whip
the
men
right
there
if
they
didn
t
the
island
would
be
their
next
halting
place
the
women
had
congregated
on
the
edge
of
the
island
to
see
them
off
and
after
giving
them
a
hearty
cheer
to
ease
their
hearts
when
they
were
away
the
cavalcade
set
out
on
its
journey
now
bring
on
your
rebs
said
dawson
nearly
of
the
men
were
on
horseback
they
had
attempted
to
form
column
of
fours
as
nearly
as
they
could
and
aided
by
some
old
soldiers
of
whom
there
were
a
goodly
number
in
the
ranks
they
managed
to
hit
the
right
number
at
last
and
before
the
brigade
had
marched
a
mile
it
was
going
along
as
orderly
as
any
old
body
of
cavalrymen
could
have
exhibited
leon
was
riding
in
the
first
four
in
company
with
giddings
dawson
and
tom
howe
and
he
was
as
lively
and
jolly
as
could
be
he
looked
all
around
but
he
couldn
t
see
either
smith
or
coleman
but
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
there
were
men
enough
to
protect
him
he
wished
that
smith
was
out
of
the
way
i
declare
it
is
always
so
soliloquized
leon
when
you
get
everything
going
just
as
you
want
it
to
there
is
always
somebody
to
step
in
and
knock
the
thing
into
a
cocked
hat
smith
won
t
get
the
money
and
he
might
as
well
give
up
bring
on
your
rebs
i
say
repeated
dawson
raising
his
carbine
and
looking
all
around
we
re
ready
for
a
fight
you
may
sing
a
different
tune
from
that
said
giddings
i
know
i
may
but
i
hope
not
said
dawson
i
want
to
keep
up
long
enough
to
pay
the
rebels
for
burning
our
it
was
three
o
clock
when
they
arrived
within
sight
of
ellisville
and
then
dawson
who
had
been
riding
all
the
way
with
sprague
took
command
under
his
supervision
the
union
men
were
all
posted
behind
the
breastworks
and
each
one
knew
where
he
belonged
his
camp
was
right
where
he
halted
and
all
the
men
had
to
do
was
to
throw
off
their
arms
picket
their
horses
and
wait
for
dinner
and
supper
which
were
to
be
served
together
if
there
was
anything
to
which
leon
objected
it
was
to
being
held
down
with
a
firm
hand
he
wanted
to
go
with
his
father
for
by
doing
that
he
knew
that
he
would
be
in
a
fair
way
to
learn
all
the
news
that
happened
within
the
borders
of
the
confederacy
as
well
as
some
things
that
occurred
outside
of
it
so
he
climbed
the
breastworks
and
went
down
to
the
porch
of
the
hotel
where
he
found
all
the
chief
men
of
the
county
gathered
and
holding
a
consultation
with
his
father
i
thought
it
best
to
burn
the
bridge
and
move
our
pickets
up
nearer
headquarters
for
it
would
put
the
rebels
to
some
trouble
to
swim
their
horses
over
the
creek
knight
was
saying
to
his
father
when
he
came
up
if
we
only
had
our
breastworks
built
nearer
the
creek
we
could
whip
them
before
they
ever
got
i
think
that
is
the
best
way
and
i
wondered
long
ago
that
you
didn
t
think
of
it
before
said
sprague
halloo
there
is
something
coming
down
there
and
what
s
that
waving
over
them
it
is
a
white
flag
as
sure
as
i
live
knight
you
are
getting
to
be
a
big
man
when
the
enemy
comes
to
consult
you
in
that
i
declare
i
believe
that
s
what
it
is
said
knight
after
he
and
the
other
chief
men
of
the
party
had
taken
a
good
view
of
it
now
we
don
t
want
them
to
see
how
many
men
we
have
got
and
i
want
you
to
order
them
all
into
the
breastworks
out
of
sight
tell
them
that
we
will
describe
the
whole
thing
to
them
after
the
rebels
go
the
chief
men
went
off
at
once
to
obey
the
order
and
by
time
the
two
confederates
got
up
to
the
hotel
porch
there
wasn
t
more
than
a
of
them
in
enough
to
act
as
for
the
president
there
were
two
rebels
in
the
party
and
with
them
were
four
pickets
whom
they
had
picked
up
after
they
had
swam
their
horses
across
the
creek
here
s
a
couple
of
gentlemen
who
want
to
see
the
president
said
one
of
the
pickets
they
have
come
to
us
with
general
lowery
s
compliments
and
want
us
to
well
i
guess
they
can
take
general
lowery
s
compliments
back
to
him
and
say
we
didn
t
come
out
here
to
surrender
said
knight
i
want
to
you
the
president
asked
one
of
the
rebels
opening
his
eyes
in
surprise
i
have
that
honor
replied
knight
the
rebels
looked
at
him
in
profound
astonishment
if
any
of
the
other
men
standing
around
had
said
that
he
was
the
president
of
the
confederacy
they
might
have
believed
it
but
for
this
man
who
stood
there
with
his
coat
off
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
hat
perched
on
the
back
of
his
him
to
say
that
he
was
the
head
and
front
of
that
rebellion
was
almost
too
much
the
rebels
looked
at
him
and
then
they
looked
at
the
men
standing
around
there
didn
t
seem
to
be
but
a
few
of
them
and
perhaps
it
was
not
going
to
be
much
to
whip
them
after
all
general
lowery
wants
you
to
surrender
at
once
said
the
rebel
who
had
grown
bolder
since
he
looked
around
you
have
my
answer
sir
said
knight
if
you
surrender
we
will
let
the
privates
off
if
they
will
enlist
in
the
army
said
the
colonel
for
leon
made
out
that
that
was
his
rank
but
the
chief
men
of
the
party
will
have
to
go
under
arrest
and
be
tried
for
that
s
very
kind
of
general
lowery
but
somehow
we
are
not
ready
to
be
tried
yet
we
won
t
why
my
goodness
my
friend
there
won
t
be
a
living
man
of
you
left
by
this
time
how
many
men
have
you
got
here
anyway
about
five
why
i
don
t
see
of
course
you
don
t
but
if
you
bring
your
four
thousand
four
hundred
men
up
have
you
had
spies
out
asked
the
rebel
more
surprised
than
ever
we
know
how
many
men
you
have
and
we
know
that
we
outnumber
them
said
knight
then
of
course
you
won
t
surrender
if
you
have
that
number
of
men
then
we
may
as
well
go
i
think
it
would
be
as
well
we
are
bound
to
kill
and
capture
some
of
the
men
you
bring
against
us
and
we
ll
send
them
inside
of
your
lines
with
their
yes
well
their
paroles
won
t
amount
to
a
row
of
i
think
they
will
if
we
capture
any
of
the
men
without
being
exchanged
we
ll
hang
them
to
the
nearest
tree
it
was
right
on
the
rebel
s
tongue
to
tell
knight
to
look
out
or
he
would
get
hung
himself
but
he
didn
t
say
it
after
looking
all
around
to
make
sure
that
there
were
no
union
men
in
sight
he
wheeled
his
horse
and
rode
off
accompanied
by
the
pickets
no
sooner
were
they
out
of
sight
around
the
first
bend
than
the
men
began
to
pour
out
of
their
breastworks
and
in
five
minutes
more
the
hotel
grounds
in
front
of
the
porch
were
just
black
with
an
eager
excited
crowd
all
anxious
to
hear
what
the
rebels
had
to
say
sprague
took
the
part
of
spokesman
and
when
he
told
them
what
the
confederates
had
said
about
there
not
being
one
union
man
left
alive
by
this
time
the
announcement
was
received
with
whoops
and
yells
let
them
bring
their
men
on
shouted
bud
mccoy
we
are
all
ready
for
you
must
remember
that
the
demand
for
a
surrender
comes
before
a
fight
said
sprague
they
may
be
up
here
in
an
hour
and
i
think
i
had
better
send
some
men
down
there
to
reinforce
those
i
ll
go
for
one
and
i
ll
go
for
another
were
the
exclamations
that
arose
from
the
crowd
and
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
it
five
hundred
men
were
all
mounted
and
armed
and
rode
up
to
the
porch
to
listen
to
their
final
instructions
from
knight
leon
wanted
to
go
too
but
a
positive
shake
of
the
head
from
his
father
told
him
that
that
thing
wouldn
t
do
at
all
you
will
get
fighting
enough
if
you
stay
right
here
said
sprague
you
do
your
duty
here
under
my
eye
and
that
is
all
i
shall
ask
of
make
as
good
a
fight
as
you
can
boys
said
knight
only
don
t
let
them
get
behind
you
be
sure
and
retreat
while
you
have
the
the
reinforcements
rode
on
down
the
road
with
dawson
in
command
and
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
sight
a
silence
fell
upon
the
men
they
had
left
behind
all
were
listening
for
the
first
report
of
a
carbine
or
rifle
that
should
announce
the
opening
of
the
battle
one
hour
passed
and
then
two
and
just
as
darkness
came
down
to
conceal
the
movements
of
the
rebels
the
report
came
it
was
followed
by
a
moment
s
silence
and
then
it
seemed
as
if
a
hurricane
was
going
through
the
woods
the
confederates
had
deployed
their
line
until
it
reached
the
woods
where
it
was
lost
to
view
and
in
that
manner
charged
across
the
stream
and
through
the
timber
but
where
were
the
union
men
who
were
to
oppose
them
for
three
miles
they
went
through
the
woods
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
the
opposition
came
when
they
least
expected
it
it
was
the
report
of
a
carbine
in
the
hands
of
young
dawson
and
the
nearest
colonel
threw
up
his
arms
and
fell
from
his
horse
a
moment
afterward
the
woods
were
fairly
aflame
in
advance
of
them
scarcely
a
yell
was
heard
for
the
union
men
fought
as
though
they
had
life
and
liberty
at
stake
fire
low
boys
said
dawson
as
he
loaded
up
for
another
shot
if
you
strike
a
man
in
the
legs
it
will
take
two
to
carry
him
the
union
men
fired
three
times
before
they
thought
of
retreat
and
the
middle
of
the
line
was
not
only
thrown
into
confusion
but
it
was
annihilated
so
that
their
officers
could
not
get
anybody
to
charge
upon
their
concealed
enemy
but
the
wings
were
all
were
stretched
out
so
far
in
the
woods
that
they
could
easily
wrap
around
the
union
men
and
capture
them
they
hastily
got
on
their
horses
and
beat
a
quick
retreat
the
company
that
came
along
the
road
was
badly
cut
up
they
were
marching
in
column
of
fours
and
it
was
their
intention
after
they
got
the
union
men
in
full
flight
to
follow
them
in
and
they
would
go
with
such
rapidity
that
they
would
take
the
breastworks
at
once
but
after
the
smoke
had
cleared
away
there
wasn
t
more
than
a
dozen
men
left
the
riders
had
been
shot
down
and
the
horses
having
no
one
to
control
them
were
running
frantically
about
trampling
the
dead
and
dying
under
their
feet
that
s
pretty
well
done
for
the
first
time
said
dawson
when
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
all
of
his
battalion
were
in
the
road
the
rest
were
in
the
woods
and
could
easily
fight
their
way
to
ellisville
now
boys
give
them
as
good
as
they
the
retreat
to
ellisville
was
accomplished
in
short
order
and
when
the
rebels
broke
from
the
woods
and
uttered
their
charging
yell
they
couldn
t
see
a
single
man
they
were
all
behind
their
breastworks
i
tell
you
we
gave
it
to
them
down
there
in
the
woods
said
dawson
as
he
rode
along
behind
the
breastworks
until
he
found
leon
and
tom
you
ought
to
have
been
along
i
reckon
i
have
paid
the
rebels
for
burning
our
house
i
lifted
one
officer
out
of
his
saddle
as
clean
as
a
did
you
kill
him
asked
leon
well
i
reckon
so
he
threw
his
arms
above
his
head
and
that
is
a
pretty
good
sign
that
he
was
done
did
you
hear
any
bullets
come
near
you
inquired
leon
who
shuddered
when
he
thought
how
coolly
dawson
could
talk
of
shooting
another
in
cold
blood
yes
sir
i
heard
them
but
the
rebels
fired
too
high
i
saw
one
man
clap
his
hand
to
his
mouth
and
say
oh
but
i
didn
t
see
who
it
was
there
they
come
said
dawson
grasping
his
carbine
with
a
firmer
hold
and
creeping
up
to
an
opening
in
the
breastworks
now
leon
show
what
you
are
made
it
is
certain
death
to
send
those
fellows
up
here
said
leon
i
wish
i
could
warn
them
haw
haw
laughed
dawson
they
know
what
is
behind
here
better
than
we
can
tell
them
if
they
don
t
they
will
soon
find
it
sprague
stood
a
little
ways
from
leon
with
his
rifle
in
his
hand
he
had
charge
of
the
brigade
now
and
it
was
his
duty
to
give
the
order
to
fire
nearer
and
nearer
came
the
rebels
yelling
like
so
many
mad
men
but
the
report
of
sprague
s
gun
couldn
t
be
heard
as
soon
as
the
men
saw
him
raise
his
piece
to
his
shoulder
they
all
fired
and
the
way
the
rebels
went
down
before
it
was
certain
proof
that
their
bullets
had
not
all
been
thrown
away
but
these
men
were
not
to
be
defeated
by
one
volley
they
kept
on
until
they
reached
the
breastworks
and
then
they
found
that
they
were
too
high
to
be
scaled
by
their
horses
the
union
men
on
the
other
side
reached
over
and
fired
their
guns
in
their
faces
until
the
confederates
could
stand
it
no
longer
they
turned
their
horses
and
fled
and
did
not
stop
until
they
were
safe
in
the
woods
from
which
they
had
just
emerged
long
live
the
confederacy
shouted
some
one
in
the
ranks
and
the
shout
was
taken
up
by
all
the
men
in
the
line
let
s
go
after
them
said
another
we
can
easy
whip
no
stay
where
you
are
said
sprague
who
got
his
instructions
from
knight
we
can
whip
them
here
but
if
we
should
get
out
of
line
of
the
breastworks
they
might
prove
too
much
for
it
was
the
occasion
of
no
little
difficulty
for
the
confederate
officers
to
rally
their
men
and
the
trouble
was
that
those
who
belonged
to
the
right
and
left
wings
reported
that
it
was
impossible
to
flank
the
union
position
those
on
the
right
said
that
there
was
a
swamp
in
which
many
men
had
been
killed
in
their
efforts
to
get
around
it
and
the
men
who
belonged
on
the
left
reported
that
there
was
the
river
there
and
that
any
attempt
to
get
by
it
would
be
useless
general
lowery
began
to
see
that
the
union
men
were
not
to
be
easily
whipped
but
he
used
all
his
eloquence
and
authority
to
induce
them
to
make
an
effort
to
carry
the
centre
of
the
line
he
dismounted
some
of
his
men
with
instructions
to
go
and
throw
down
the
breastworks
and
the
rebel
cavalry
was
to
be
close
behind
them
and
go
in
at
the
openings
they
had
made
this
was
the
plan
that
general
lee
decided
on
when
he
made
the
attempt
to
split
grant
s
lines
by
his
assault
on
fort
steadman
he
had
half
his
army
in
that
exploit
but
his
effort
ended
just
as
general
lowery
s
did
to
split
the
union
lines
here
the
second
attempt
was
grandly
made
and
the
fight
lasted
a
little
longer
than
it
did
at
first
but
the
dismounted
men
were
quickly
picked
off
the
cavalry
began
dropping
here
and
there
and
finally
without
a
word
from
anybody
they
all
took
to
their
heels
this
time
there
was
nothing
said
about
pursuit
for
the
union
men
had
their
blood
up
and
nobody
could
have
controlled
them
by
the
time
the
rebels
were
in
the
woods
the
union
men
had
mounted
their
horses
and
started
after
them
leon
was
in
this
exploit
and
his
father
did
not
tell
him
to
stay
behind
he
didn
t
find
any
confederates
on
the
way
but
he
assisted
in
making
some
noise
so
he
did
just
as
much
as
anybody
this
was
the
last
attempt
that
was
made
to
break
up
the
confederacy
the
rebels
saw
that
the
union
men
were
in
earnest
and
they
gave
it
up
as
a
bad
job
a
week
afterward
a
big
was
captured
and
taken
to
their
place
of
refuge
on
the
island
and
after
that
the
union
men
breathed
a
good
deal
easier
they
were
going
to
have
grub
enough
to
support
them
no
matter
what
happened
about
this
time
too
some
more
men
began
to
come
in
and
leon
saw
the
army
grow
from
one
thousand
men
to
more
than
twenty
thousand
of
course
with
such
an
army
as
that
the
confederates
wouldn
t
try
to
whip
them
they
minded
their
own
business
going
out
whenever
they
thought
that
their
provisions
were
getting
low
and
picking
up
and
taking
them
where
they
would
do
the
most
good
of
course
too
these
parties
when
they
went
out
always
captured
some
papers
which
were
read
until
they
almost
crumbled
to
pieces
when
the
rebels
were
defeated
at
vicksburg
and
gettysburg
the
union
men
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
for
they
thought
that
the
war
was
almost
ended
and
that
they
could
go
home
but
there
were
some
severe
battles
to
be
fought
before
their
flag
could
wave
over
the
entire
country
one
day
long
months
after
this
when
leon
had
got
so
tired
of
being
a
soldier
that
he
wished
that
the
confederacy
would
sink
or
do
something
else
that
would
wipe
it
out
of
existence
he
was
out
with
a
party
of
skirmishers
when
they
ran
plump
onto
a
rebel
soldier
who
had
a
gun
on
his
shoulder
and
acted
as
though
he
was
going
somewhere
in
an
instant
bud
mccoy
s
pistol
was
aimed
at
his
breast
put
up
your
revolver
young
man
said
the
rebel
who
did
not
seem
at
all
abashed
by
finding
himself
in
the
company
of
union
men
you
belong
down
in
jones
county
don
t
you
well
i
want
to
say
that
you
are
behind
the
times
general
lee
has
surrendered
bud
and
the
rest
were
so
astonished
that
they
could
not
say
a
word
it
s
a
fact
continued
the
rebel
i
wasn
t
there
because
i
was
in
our
western
army
but
i
heard
of
it
and
more
than
five
thousand
of
us
escaped
that
night
the
confederacy
has
gone
up
i
tell
you
i
am
glad
of
it
replied
leon
why
didn
t
you
surrender
when
you
got
whipped
at
gettysburg
a
good
many
men
said
it
ought
to
have
been
done
answered
the
rebel
but
i
wasn
t
at
the
head
of
affairs
you
had
better
let
me
go
for
i
want
to
reach
home
and
see
my
wife
i
haven
t
seen
her
since
i
went
into
the
the
foragers
were
only
too
glad
to
let
him
go
they
would
have
passed
anybody
who
brought
such
news
as
that
and
furthermore
they
wheeled
their
horses
and
went
back
to
ellisville
with
much
more
speed
than
they
had
shown
in
coming
out
there
was
joy
on
the
island
when
they
told
what
the
rebel
had
said
to
them
and
some
of
the
men
fired
off
their
guns
in
ecstacy
but
knight
said
that
the
rebels
had
so
long
been
accustomed
to
lying
that
they
didn
t
know
when
they
spoke
the
truth
and
suggested
that
it
would
be
better
for
them
if
they
sent
a
couple
of
men
down
to
mobile
to
see
what
was
going
on
there
any
number
of
men
offered
themselves
but
two
were
promptly
sent
and
while
they
were
gone
the
refugees
hardly
knew
what
to
do
with
themselves
in
due
time
the
men
came
back
and
better
than
all
they
swung
a
paper
over
their
heads
it
s
a
yankee
paper
and
now
we
ll
get
at
the
truth
of
the
matter
said
one
of
the
messengers
yes
sir
lee
has
surrendered
that
whole
army
has
surrendered
and
the
fortifications
down
at
mobile
are
just
black
with
yankees
cheers
long
and
loud
rent
the
air
at
this
announcement
so
that
it
was
a
long
time
before
sprague
could
read
what
the
paper
said
in
regard
to
lee
s
surrender
when
he
read
it
the
cheers
once
more
broke
out
afresh
they
said
that
we
couldn
t
take
this
county
out
of
the
confederacy
said
knight
i
reckon
we
ve
done
something
that
nobody
else
could
a
day
or
two
after
this
companies
of
union
cavalry
began
scouting
about
mobile
to
see
if
they
could
find
any
rebels
and
some
of
them
presented
themselves
before
knight
the
officer
listened
in
amazement
while
he
was
told
the
story
and
when
knight
had
got
through
he
laughed
until
he
could
hardly
sit
on
his
horse
the
union
men
all
laughed
too
and
taken
all
together
it
was
a
jolly
different
from
what
they
felt
while
they
were
resisting
the
cavalry
that
tried
so
hard
to
overpower
them
the
officer
told
them
that
they
could
go
home
that
the
war
was
ended
and
that
they
would
never
be
called
upon
to
fight
for
the
flag
again
after
that
there
was
a
good
deal
of
excitement
in
and
around
ellisville
for
the
refugees
were
making
efforts
to
go
home
the
bridge
over
the
bayou
that
had
been
burned
to
keep
the
rebels
from
getting
across
so
easily
was
rebuilt
and
after
that
leon
and
his
father
had
their
hands
full
in
saying
to
the
union
men
who
wished
them
every
success
in
life
then
they
went
home
and
went
to
work
getting
their
ground
ready
to
plant
a
supply
of
cotton
glad
indeed
to
handle
a
plow
once
more
instead
of
a
rifle
their
object
was
to
throw
smith
off
the
scent
they
had
seen
him
a
few
times
during
the
last
few
months
but
he
had
nothing
to
say
to
them
but
the
sequel
proved
that
he
knew
what
he
was
talking
about
when
he
threatened
to
camp
on
his
cousin
s
place
and
shoot
the
man
or
boy
who
came
there
for
the
money
he
lived
in
smith
s
house
for
the
rebels
had
not
had
time
to
set
the
buildings
on
fire
but
it
was
close
to
the
so
it
would
be
next
to
impossible
for
them
to
go
there
and
dig
for
what
was
hidden
in
it
and
every
day
he
rode
over
the
plantation
to
make
sure
that
the
spragues
had
not
dug
in
some
other
place
sprague
kept
close
watch
of
his
movements
and
one
day
announced
to
leon
his
plan
of
action
we
will
go
there
and
hunt
for
that
money
said
he
but
mind
you
we
won
t
dig
where
it
is
we
will
go
down
into
the
lower
part
of
the
plantation
and
dig
there
and
when
we
come
away
we
ll
leave
a
shovel
there
how
will
that
do
he
will
be
sure
to
see
the
shovel
and
at
night
he
will
watch
that
place
and
leave
the
free
for
leon
didn
t
see
that
anything
else
could
be
done
so
he
readily
fell
in
with
his
father
s
proposal
when
night
came
they
set
out
and
selecting
a
place
where
some
brush
had
been
thrown
to
get
it
out
of
the
way
they
threw
it
aside
and
in
a
few
minutes
had
a
hole
dug
there
that
was
six
feet
deep
then
they
placed
a
shovel
in
a
conspicuous
position
and
went
home
wondering
what
was
to
be
the
result
of
sprague
s
new
scheme
they
were
not
long
in
finding
out
the
next
day
about
ten
o
clock
leonard
smith
rode
by
on
his
horse
and
seeing
the
father
and
son
employed
in
plowing
the
field
stopped
and
had
a
word
to
say
to
them
you
didn
t
get
the
money
last
night
did
you
he
asked
while
his
face
was
white
with
fury
i
know
where
it
is
now
and
i
will
give
you
fair
warning
that
if
either
of
you
go
there
again
i
will
shoot
sprague
made
no
reply
and
smith
rode
off
when
night
came
they
set
out
this
time
they
went
on
horseback
and
told
sprague
that
if
she
heard
them
going
by
some
time
during
the
must
pack
up
the
next
day
and
go
to
mobile
sprague
and
leon
were
armed
of
course
they
went
up
the
road
until
they
came
to
smith
s
gate
and
there
sprague
left
leon
while
he
went
ahead
to
reconnoitre
he
was
gone
half
an
hour
and
when
he
came
back
his
words
were
full
of
news
there
s
nobody
about
the
house
said
he
and
one
wouldn
t
think
that
he
had
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
at
stake
now
we
must
go
quickly
stay
by
the
horses
heads
so
that
they
won
t
call
out
i
will
do
the
with
a
heart
that
beat
like
a
leon
dismounted
passed
the
shovel
over
to
his
father
and
followed
along
after
him
when
he
led
the
way
toward
the
the
house
was
all
dark
and
it
didn
t
look
as
though
anybody
lived
there
but
leon
couldn
t
help
drawing
a
long
breath
when
he
thought
of
the
unerring
rifle
that
was
hidden
somewhere
about
his
father
got
into
the
pen
and
pried
up
the
boards
and
he
did
it
without
causing
anything
to
creak
then
by
putting
down
his
shovel
in
various
positions
he
found
where
the
earth
had
been
disturbed
and
then
he
went
to
work
never
had
he
worked
so
hard
before
but
it
seemed
an
age
to
leon
as
he
stood
there
holding
fast
to
the
horses
at
length
to
his
great
relief
his
father
seized
something
and
held
it
over
the
side
of
the
pen
leon
he
exclaimed
here
s
one
of
them
how
heavy
it
was
but
just
as
leon
was
going
to
take
it
he
heard
the
sound
of
horses
hoofs
up
smith
s
lane
his
horses
heard
it
too
and
raised
their
heads
to
see
what
was
coming
father
father
they
are
coming
back
he
faltered
can
t
you
find
the
other
one
yes
here
it
is
now
you
get
on
your
horse
and
ride
for
dear
life
and
i
will
stay
behind
i
will
keep
them
from
overtaking
leon
was
on
his
horse
in
a
moment
the
other
valise
was
passed
up
to
him
and
in
another
second
he
was
flying
down
the
road
sprague
was
close
behind
him
but
before
they
had
gone
far
they
heard
some
muttered
ejaculations
from
the
horsemen
followed
by
the
command
i
declare
there
is
that
sprague
halt
i
say
halt
but
leon
and
his
father
were
not
given
to
halting
their
horses
went
faster
than
ever
and
by
the
time
he
was
one
of
the
lingered
to
look
at
the
they
were
far
out
of
sight
then
followed
a
volley
from
their
one
or
two
of
from
a
dozen
which
proved
that
smith
had
found
more
than
one
man
to
assist
him
but
all
the
balls
went
high
or
wild
and
sprague
and
leon
got
safely
off
they
crossed
the
bridge
travelled
rapidly
along
the
road
that
led
to
mobile
and
by
ten
o
clock
the
next
day
had
the
money
safely
in
the
bank
on
the
next
day
but
one
sprague
came
along
she
told
a
pretty
thrilling
story
about
what
had
happened
to
her
since
sprague
left
smith
was
so
mad
to
think
they
had
got
away
with
the
money
that
he
burned
her
house
over
her
head
and
did
not
even
leave
her
a
negro
cabin
to
go
in
to
illustration
the
hidden
fortune
safe
at
last
here
we
will
leave
leon
sprague
only
stating
that
he
came
on
to
clayton
where
sprague
had
some
friends
who
gave
him
a
cordial
welcome
they
purchased
a
neat
little
house
which
had
been
deserted
by
its
owner
during
the
war
and
as
they
now
lived
there
six
years
it
began
to
look
very
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
bob
nellis
almost
as
soon
as
he
got
into
town
through
him
learned
of
the
academy
at
which
the
latter
was
preparing
for
college
and
went
with
him
and
entered
his
name
on
the
books
when
he
went
there
next
term
of
course
he
was
in
the
lowest
class
but
he
studied
his
books
night
and
day
and
the
result
was
very
soon
apparent
in
two
years
he
was
up
with
boys
of
his
own
age
we
said
that
joe
lufkin
had
not
forgotten
the
raid
he
was
going
to
make
on
that
watering
place
the
time
he
talked
of
stealing
all
the
jewels
he
made
it
and
perhaps
we
shall
see
what
came
of
it
his
son
hank
got
a
boat
about
this
time
and
what
he
did
with
it
and
how
it
took
