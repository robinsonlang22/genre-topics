chapter
i
all
their
own
oh
two
rooms
oh
a
fireplace
oh
a
these
exclamations
fell
swiftly
and
explosively
from
the
lips
of
dotty
rose
and
dolly
fayre
as
they
leaned
over
the
table
at
which
rose
was
drawing
plans
and
such
plans
and
for
such
a
purpose
why
the
whole
project
was
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
house
a
real
little
house
for
those
two
fortunate
girls
all
their
own
with
fireplaces
and
and
goodness
knows
what
all
delightful
contrivances
it
had
come
about
because
of
the
fact
that
the
girls
had
to
study
pretty
hard
now
that
they
were
in
high
school
and
both
found
difficulty
in
finding
just
the
right
place
to
study
dolly
declared
that
trudy
was
always
having
company
and
the
laughter
and
chatter
was
so
permeating
she
couldn
t
find
a
place
in
the
house
to
get
out
of
hearing
the
noise
while
dotty
said
little
genie
was
always
carrying
on
with
her
young
playmates
or
else
mother
and
aunt
clara
were
having
sewing
society
or
something
and
she
never
could
be
quiet
in
the
library
the
girls
of
course
had
their
own
bedrooms
but
both
mothers
objected
on
hygienic
grounds
to
using
those
for
so
rose
had
cooked
up
a
most
fascinating
scheme
and
after
a
discussion
with
fayre
he
elucidated
it
to
the
girls
it
seemed
fayre
fully
approved
of
it
and
was
quite
willing
to
pay
his
share
of
the
expense
but
he
was
too
busy
to
look
after
the
details
of
building
and
begged
rose
to
attend
to
all
that
rose
who
was
cashier
of
the
berwick
bank
had
plenty
of
leisure
time
and
moreover
had
a
taste
for
architecture
so
the
plans
were
in
process
of
drafting
as
the
house
was
to
be
exceedingly
simple
he
felt
he
could
plan
it
all
himself
and
thus
save
the
expense
of
an
architect
you
see
he
said
to
his
interested
audience
it
is
really
nothing
but
a
summer
house
only
it
is
enclosed
so
as
to
a
interrupted
dotty
oh
daddy
it
is
too
perfectly
scrumptiousiferous
i
don
t
see
how
i
can
live
through
such
joy
dolly
s
blue
eyes
sparkled
but
her
pleasure
was
too
deep
for
words
and
she
expressed
it
in
long
drawn
sighs
and
occasional
oh
s
say
twenty
feet
by
fifteen
for
the
whole
house
rose
said
musingly
then
divide
that
in
halves
thus
we
have
a
front
room
a
sort
of
living
room
ten
by
fifteen
quite
big
enough
for
in
addition
we
can
have
a
deep
at
each
where
we
can
curl
up
in
to
study
cried
dotty
oh
dollyrinda
did
you
ever
anything
so
perfect
i
never
did
and
what
is
in
the
other
room
rose
well
a
sort
of
say
ten
by
ten
of
it
and
that
will
leave
a
neat
little
five
by
ten
for
a
bit
of
a
can
t
take
it
all
in
a
kitchenette
where
we
can
make
fudge
and
cook
dotty
threw
her
arms
around
her
father
s
neck
and
in
her
great
gratitude
dolly
did
too
well
of
course
the
isn
t
exactly
for
an
eating
room
exclusively
but
i
know
you
will
enjoy
having
little
teas
there
with
your
friends
or
taffy
pulls
or
whatever
the
fad
is
oh
indeed
we
can
said
dolly
we
can
all
go
there
after
skating
and
have
hot
chocolate
and
sandwiches
maybe
it
won
t
be
fun
but
it
is
primarily
for
study
warned
rose
i
don
t
think
though
you
two
bookworms
will
neglect
your
he
was
right
for
both
dolly
and
dotty
were
studious
and
now
being
in
the
high
school
they
were
most
anxious
to
make
good
records
they
studied
diligently
every
evening
and
though
dotty
learned
her
lessons
more
quickly
dolly
remembered
hers
better
but
both
were
fond
of
fun
and
frolic
and
they
foresaw
wonderful
opportunities
in
the
new
house
oh
a
piazza
squealed
dotty
as
under
her
father
s
clever
fingers
a
wide
piazza
showed
on
the
paper
yes
of
course
this
will
be
a
summer
house
also
you
know
and
a
piazza
is
a
necessity
perhaps
in
the
winter
it
can
be
enclosed
with
glass
all
such
details
must
come
later
first
we
must
get
the
proportions
and
the
main
plan
and
here
it
is
in
a
nutshell
or
rather
in
a
rectangle
just
half
is
the
and
the
other
half
is
and
kitchen
the
kitchen
includes
kitchenette
and
what
is
a
kitchenette
exactly
asked
dolly
only
what
its
name
implies
returned
rose
smiling
just
a
little
kitchen
there
will
be
a
gas
stove
i
think
it
would
be
better
for
you
to
have
it
all
electric
then
you
can
have
an
electric
oven
and
toaster
and
and
any
such
contraptions
you
want
how
s
that
too
good
to
be
true
and
dolly
sighed
in
deep
contentment
how
long
will
it
take
to
build
it
not
long
if
i
can
get
the
workmen
to
go
right
at
it
and
i
hope
i
can
now
suppose
we
plan
the
which
is
of
course
the
let
s
call
it
the
study
said
dolly
sounds
sort
of
wise
and
very
well
here
then
in
the
study
suppose
we
have
the
door
right
in
the
middle
of
the
front
wall
and
opening
on
the
front
veranda
then
a
small
window
each
side
of
the
door
and
a
big
square
bay
with
cushioned
seat
at
each
end
of
the
glorious
and
dolly
danced
about
on
one
foot
then
we
can
each
have
one
of
them
to
study
in
every
afternoon
after
with
a
blazing
wood
s
the
fireplace
daddy
here
opposite
the
entrance
door
then
you
see
one
chimney
in
the
middle
of
the
house
will
provide
for
a
fireplace
in
each
room
i
m
not
sure
this
will
give
you
heat
enough
if
not
you
must
depend
on
gas
logs
we
can
t
be
bothered
with
a
furnace
of
any
sort
perhaps
in
the
very
coldest
weather
you
can
t
inhabit
your
oh
that
won
t
matter
and
dolly
s
face
smiled
brightly
if
we
have
it
most
of
the
time
we
ll
willingly
study
somewhere
else
on
extra
cold
days
and
at
one
side
of
the
fireplace
the
door
through
to
the
yes
i
right
my
child
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
fireplace
in
the
study
a
set
of
bookshelves
and
in
the
a
glass
but
we
haven
t
any
glass
and
dotty
looked
amazed
at
the
idea
well
i
dare
say
the
mothers
of
you
will
scout
around
and
give
you
some
old
junk
from
the
attics
i
know
of
a
gorgeous
dish
you
can
rose
s
eyes
twinkled
and
dotty
broke
into
laughter
i
know
you
mean
the
eyesore
this
was
a
hideous
affair
that
some
one
had
sent
rose
as
a
christmas
gift
and
the
family
had
long
since
relegated
it
to
the
oblivion
of
a
dark
cupboard
no
thank
you
dot
went
on
i
d
rather
have
things
from
the
they
have
some
awfully
nice
things
there
suggested
dolly
and
i
know
mother
has
a
lot
of
odds
and
ends
we
can
have
oh
when
the
house
is
built
it
will
be
lots
of
fun
to
furnish
it
trudy
will
make
us
lovely
and
things
like
that
and
we
can
have
paper
napkins
for
our
and
aunt
clara
says
she
will
make
all
the
curtains
sort
we
that
s
lovely
of
her
i
know
we
ll
have
lots
of
things
given
to
us
and
we
ll
find
lots
of
things
around
our
the
rest
we
ll
do
yes
and
thomas
will
bring
wood
for
us
and
take
away
the
ashes
we
must
have
enormous
or
oh
it
s
just
like
furnishing
a
real
house
what
loads
of
fun
we
ll
have
then
in
the
kitchen
rose
went
on
drawing
as
he
spoke
we
ll
have
a
tiny
sink
all
nice
white
enamel
and
a
for
your
and
soap
and
such
things
also
a
sort
of
a
very
cabinet
for
your
pepper
and
salt
with
a
place
underneath
for
pans
and
you
think
a
lot
about
the
kitchen
daddy
i
believe
you
expect
to
come
there
sometimes
to
join
our
i
certainly
shall
if
i
m
invited
then
you
see
the
can
have
a
deep
window
and
if
you
don
t
care
for
a
there
how
about
a
of
bright
flowers
i
don
t
know
about
that
rose
demurred
dolly
if
the
house
isn
t
always
warm
the
poor
posies
would
freeze
wouldn
t
they
right
you
are
dollykins
cut
out
the
growing
plants
then
and
have
now
and
then
a
vase
or
bowl
of
flowers
on
the
table
now
let
me
see
an
electric
light
over
the
table
in
the
and
perhaps
a
side
light
or
two
then
in
the
study
a
reading
light
for
each
and
one
or
two
pretty
fixtures
why
will
we
use
it
so
much
at
night
rose
if
you
choose
to
and
anyway
in
the
winter
time
you
ll
need
lights
by
five
o
clock
or
on
dark
days
even
that
s
so
how
thoughtful
you
are
i
s
pose
some
days
we
won
t
go
in
the
house
at
all
and
others
we
ll
be
there
all
the
afternoon
and
all
the
and
all
saturdays
said
dotty
we
ll
always
spend
saturdays
there
and
we
can
make
things
for
the
house
or
make
our
christmas
presents
or
make
fudge
and
have
the
girls
and
boys
come
or
just
sit
by
the
fire
and
read
interrupted
dolly
oh
you
old
kitten
you
d
rather
lie
by
the
fire
and
purr
than
do
anything
at
all
well
then
i
ll
do
that
we
re
to
do
whatever
we
please
in
our
own
house
aren
t
we
rose
yes
indeed
dolly
but
amicable
always
no
i
don
t
think
you
two
are
inclined
to
quarrel
but
you
do
have
little
differences
now
and
then
and
i
d
hate
to
have
the
charm
of
this
little
nest
disturbed
by
foolish
i
ll
promise
for
one
to
scrap
said
dolly
eagerly
and
dotty
said
with
equal
fervour
me
too
we
ll
have
nice
plain
hard
floors
continued
rose
and
i
m
sure
your
mothers
can
find
some
discarded
oh
we
can
make
those
exclaimed
dolly
don
t
you
know
dot
that
new
way
your
aunt
clara
told
us
about
you
take
rags
you
know
and
sew
them
in
pipings
and
then
crochet
them
it
s
just
lovely
yes
i
know
we
ll
each
make
one
of
those
it
ll
be
fine
and
we
ll
put
them
in
the
study
one
on
each
side
of
the
room
yours
on
my
side
mine
on
all
right
which
side
do
you
want
i
ll
take
the
side
next
my
house
and
you
the
side
next
yours
then
if
our
mothers
call
us
we
can
hear
good
idea
said
rose
i
think
we
ll
put
the
house
just
on
the
dividing
line
between
your
father
s
ground
and
and
mother
can
hang
a
red
flag
out
the
window
if
she
wants
me
in
a
hurry
or
if
dinner
is
we
might
have
a
telephone
suggested
dotty
we
ll
see
about
that
later
said
rose
you
must
remember
that
the
expenses
are
counting
up
and
fayre
and
i
are
not
millionaires
but
we
want
you
to
have
a
good
substantial
little
nook
for
yourselves
then
later
if
we
see
fit
to
add
a
telephone
or
a
wireless
apparatus
or
an
airship
garage
we
can
do
all
right
returned
dotty
with
a
satisfied
grin
say
doll
shall
we
bring
our
desks
from
our
bedrooms
no
rose
answered
for
her
those
are
too
flimsy
and
dainty
and
besides
you
ll
need
them
where
they
are
i
shall
ask
the
privilege
of
contributing
two
solid
sensible
mission
desks
of
greenish
tinge
with
chairs
to
match
then
if
you
want
to
curl
up
on
your
window
cushions
to
study
you
may
but
there
will
be
a
place
to
write
your
lovely
father
how
good
you
are
and
dotty
fell
on
his
neck
while
dolly
possessed
herself
of
his
hand
and
patted
it
the
two
girls
were
equally
fond
of
their
fathers
but
rose
was
more
chummy
in
manner
than
fayre
the
latter
was
devoted
to
his
children
but
was
less
demonstrative
of
his
affection
but
dolly
well
knew
that
her
father
would
not
be
outdone
in
kindness
or
generosity
and
that
he
would
give
an
equally
welcome
gift
as
well
as
pay
his
share
of
the
building
expenses
all
right
rose
she
said
if
you
do
that
i
m
sure
father
will
furnish
the
with
whatever
we
there
won
t
be
much
needed
for
that
just
a
table
and
chairs
which
can
doubtless
be
snared
in
our
attics
but
your
father
dotty
offered
the
whole
kitchenette
outfit
which
i
can
tell
you
is
a
noble
indeed
it
is
cried
dotty
i
m
crazy
to
get
at
that
business
so
m
i
declared
dolly
when
will
it
be
all
done
rose
can
t
say
exactly
if
all
goes
well
you
ought
to
get
in
by
the
last
of
about
hallowe
en
then
said
dolly
we
might
have
a
kind
of
hallowe
en
party
for
a
gay
cried
dotty
we
ll
get
all
our
treasures
in
it
by
that
let
s
call
it
our
treasure
house
s
that
for
a
name
pretty
good
said
rose
i
ve
been
wondering
what
to
call
it
treasure
house
isn
t
bad
at
all
makes
you
think
of
treasure
yes
so
it
does
and
dolly
s
blue
eyes
sparkled
at
the
name
of
one
of
her
books
oh
won
t
it
be
fun
to
arrange
our
bookshelves
i
m
glad
to
move
some
of
my
books
my
shelves
at
home
are
then
you
see
children
rose
was
still
adding
to
his
drawings
in
the
summer
you
can
have
hammocks
on
the
veranda
and
with
yes
daddy
dear
you
get
those
set
up
as
soon
as
the
gentle
spring
gets
well
i
do
love
flowers
and
rose
smiled
for
his
family
well
knew
his
great
fondness
for
gardening
now
you
girls
won
t
have
any
too
much
time
to
get
your
flummerydiddles
ready
for
after
the
house
is
built
and
papered
and
painted
you
ought
to
have
your
furnishings
all
ready
and
to
make
curtains
and
cushions
and
lace
whatd
y
will
be
a
few
weeks
work
t
it
yes
indeedy
but
all
our
beloved
lady
relatives
will
help
us
and
among
our
sisters
and
our
mothers
and
our
aunts
i
spect
we
ll
accumulate
about
enough
housekeeping
stuff
to
stock
a
dotty
danced
around
the
table
as
she
talked
and
catching
dolly
in
her
arms
the
two
executed
a
sort
of
triumphal
that
expressed
their
joy
and
relieved
their
feelings
and
now
sighed
dolly
suddenly
looking
thoughtful
i
ve
got
to
go
right
straight
smack
home
and
do
my
geometry
for
oh
my
goodness
me
too
exclaimed
dotty
dear
how
i
wish
treasure
house
was
done
and

a
group
of
their
friends
giggling
and
whispering
in
a
corner
of
the
recreation
room

the
joke

dotty

tell

dolly

us
tod
what
is
it
she
was
taking
off
her
hat
and
coat
as
she
talked
and
as
she
stepped
into
the
coatroom
to
hang
them
up
celia
ferris
slipped
in
and
whispered
to
her
now
don
t
jump
on
the
scheme
dolly
fayre
you
re
such
a
i
m
half
afraid
to
let
you
in
on
why
is
it
mean
and
dolly
s
blue
eyes
flashed
for
she
hated
a
mean
joke
no
it
isn
t
mean
at
least
no
meaner
than
she
deserves
but
i
wish
they
wouldn
t
tell
you
you
re
an
old
spoilsport
and
i
know
you
ll
say
you
won
t
join
join
in
what
do
tell
me
or
i
can
t
say
i
ll
come
on
out
tod
will
tell
you
and
the
two
girls
joined
the
others
what
is
it
tod
asked
dolly
as
she
came
up
to
the
laughing
boy
now
dollykin
do
be
real
nice
and
don
t
be
a
horrid
old
miss
prim
you
see
miss
partland
the
geometry
teacher
is
so
cross
and
horrid
and
unjust
to
us
we
re
going
to
pay
her
out
and
we
ve
thought
up
the
greatest
scheme
just
listen
no
let
me
tell
her
said
joe
collins
you
ll
make
it
seem
worse
n
it
is
why
doll
it
s
only
this
you
see
miss
partland
isn
t
looking
very
well
and
we
are
all
going
to
tell
her
so
she
ought
to
know
the
truth
and
she
keeps
a
lot
of
us
in
every
afternoon
and
we
don
t
want
her
to
so
we
re
each
going
to
tell
her
as
we
get
the
chance
that
she
looks
sort
of
ill
and
then
we
think
she
ll
want
to
go
home
early
herself
and
she
won
t
stay
to
keep
us
in
isn
t
that
all
right
why
that
doesn
t
seem
very
bad
said
dolly
dimpling
as
she
smiled
how
are
you
going
to
bring
it
in
oh
just
casually
you
know
if
you
have
a
chance
you
just
say
aren
t
you
feeling
well
miss
partland
or
something
like
i
d
just
as
lieve
say
that
if
she
looks
ill
but
i
won
t
if
she
doesn
t
returned
holly
very
decidedly
all
right
you
ll
find
she
looks
why
the
poor
lady
is
on
the
verge
of
nervous
prostration
and
so
will
we
all
be
if
she
is
so
hard
on
did
she
keep
you
in
yesterday
yep
just
cause
i
had
a
little
mite
of
a
mistake
in
one
example
oh
she
s
the
limit
she
is
and
do
you
think
she
ll
be
any
if
we
sympathise
with
her
for
feeling
bad
well
maybe
you
never
can
i
think
it
s
a
grand
scheme
declared
dotty
she
s
an
old
fuss
anyway
she
found
fault
with
my
examples
because
i
didn
t
take
a
separate
sheet
of
paper
for
each
one
i
d
just
as
lieve
only
i
didn
t
know
she
wanted
me
how
s
your
house
comin
on
dot
sang
out
lollie
henry
perfectly
great
it
ll
be
done
by
hallowe
en
and
maybe
we
won
t
have
one
rollicking
good
time
won
t
we
just
you
want
to
look
out
you
know
hallowe
en
is
the
time
for
tricks
and
i
dunno
what
the
boys
will
get
not
in
our
new
house
if
anybody
takes
our
doors
off
of
their
hinges
or
does
anything
mean
i
won
t
stand
it
that
s
all
and
dotty
shook
her
curly
black
head
and
her
dark
eyes
sparkled
with
anger
at
the
thought
of
such
desecration
well
look
out
that
s
all
said
lollie
teasingly
and
then
the
bell
called
them
to
the
schoolroom
soon
after
they
all
trooped
to
a
classroom
for
the
geometry
lesson
as
he
passed
the
teacher
s
desk
tod
brown
tripped
against
her
platform
and
nearly
fell
over
on
it
what
a
clumsy
boy
exclaimed
miss
partland
frowning
and
indeed
the
stumble
was
an
awkward
one
small
wonder
as
it
was
done
entirely
on
purpose
tod
straightened
himself
up
made
a
nice
boyish
bow
and
said
please
excuse
me
miss
partland
oh
don
t
feel
alarmed
i
m
not
and
i
m
not
alarmed
you
silly
boy
i
am
annoyed
at
you
not
sorry
for
yes
m
but
miss
partland
you
re
so
white
why
you
look
quite
ill
mayn
t
i
get
you
a
glass
of
water
go
to
your
seat
miss
partland
turned
scarlet
both
from
irritation
at
tod
s
speech
and
a
sudden
nervous
fear
for
herself
tod
went
to
his
place
and
when
it
was
tad
s
turn
to
go
to
the
blackboard
he
paused
a
moment
and
looked
straight
into
the
teacher
s
face
why
miss
partland
he
whispered
to
her
don
t
you
feel
well
you
look
awful
queer
go
to
the
board
she
said
but
she
was
evidently
disturbed
at
his
remark
tad
went
obediently
and
did
his
work
well
then
as
he
returned
to
his
seat
he
gave
miss
partland
a
long
searching
look
and
gravely
shook
his
head
the
other
pupils
saw
him
and
saw
too
that
the
teacher
looked
worried
the
joke
was
working
surely
she
would
not
stay
to
keep
anybody
in
next
was
dotty
s
turn
she
went
toward
the
blackboard
but
on
the
way
she
stopped
in
front
of
miss
partland
and
looked
at
her
then
with
an
anxious
look
on
her
face
she
stepped
up
on
the
platform
and
whispering
in
the
teacher
s
ear
said
if
you
re
not
feeling
well
miss
partland
why
don
t
you
go
to
the
rest
room
for
a
while
i
m
perfectly
well
child
what
s
the
matter
with
you
you
don
t
look
so
said
dotty
shaking
her
head
and
looking
back
at
her
victim
as
she
moved
slowly
to
the
board
several
others
did
similarly
some
not
commenting
on
the
teacher
s
looks
but
merely
staring
at
her
and
then
looking
away
quickly
dolly
fayre
had
not
noticed
much
of
the
whole
performance
for
she
was
behind
with
her
lesson
and
was
struggling
with
a
refractory
problem
hoping
to
get
it
done
before
she
had
to
go
to
the
blackboard
to
demonstrate
it
and
so
when
she
rose
from
her
seat
she
was
surprised
and
shocked
to
see
how
alarmed
miss
partland
looked
indeed
the
poor
lady
was
all
upset
with
bewilderment
at
the
observations
made
by
her
pupils
she
had
begun
to
think
there
must
be
something
serious
and
noticeable
the
matter
with
her
she
was
trembling
with
nervous
apprehension
and
was
on
the
verge
of
tears
and
so
dolly
who
had
forgotten
tod
s
joke
said
most
honestly
why
what
the
matter
miss
partland
you
look
awfully
ill
the
other
pupils
hearing
this
chuckled
silently
thinking
what
a
good
little
actress
dolly
was
but
to
miss
partland
it
was
the
last
straw
i
am
ill
she
cried
out
very
help
me
dolly
to
the
rest
leaning
on
the
shoulder
of
dolly
who
was
pretty
well
frightened
miss
partland
stumbled
along
to
the
rest
room
place
provided
for
any
one
suddenly
indisposed
dolly
assisted
her
teacher
to
lie
down
on
a
couch
and
dipping
her
handkerchief
in
cold
water
held
it
to
her
forehead
let
me
call
somebody
said
dolly
i
don
t
know
what
i
ought
to
no
i
feel
better
now
said
miss
partland
but
i
can
t
go
back
to
the
classroom
i
think
i
must
go
home
you
may
go
to
macintosh
dolly
and
tell
him
i
went
home
yes
miss
partland
replied
dolly
and
then
it
suddenly
came
to
her
that
this
was
the
result
of
tod
s
joke
were
you
ill
this
morning
she
asked
no
not
in
the
slightest
it
is
a
sudden
attack
of
some
sort
perhaps
i
shall
die
oh
no
you
ll
be
all
right
in
an
hour
or
so
what
sort
of
pain
do
you
feel
miss
partland
not
any
definite
pain
but
queer
all
over
as
if
some
illness
were
i
do
believe
thought
dolly
to
herself
that
it
s
all
the
fault
of
those
horrid
boys
telling
her
she
looked
ill
and
then
she
suddenly
remembered
that
she
herself
had
told
miss
partland
so
too
and
very
emphatically
but
she
had
told
her
in
earnest
while
the
others
had
been
carrying
out
their
jest
however
her
comment
was
just
the
same
as
theirs
and
doubtless
helped
to
produce
this
effect
she
wondered
what
to
do
at
first
she
thought
she
would
tell
the
whole
story
and
let
the
boys
and
girls
take
the
consequences
of
their
joke
then
she
feared
it
might
so
enrage
miss
partland
to
know
of
it
that
it
would
make
her
worse
she
decided
not
to
tell
at
present
anyway
and
she
helped
the
teacher
on
with
her
hat
and
coat
and
went
with
her
to
the
door
tell
macintosh
i
am
quite
ill
she
said
as
she
went
away
and
dolly
went
to
the
principal
s
room
to
do
her
bidding
did
miss
partland
say
what
the
trouble
was
asked
the
surprised
man
is
she
subject
to
these
attacks
she
didn
t
say
macintosh
and
i
have
never
known
her
to
be
ill
before
i
think
she
will
be
all
right
you
seem
to
know
a
great
deal
for
a
miss
of
your
age
have
you
had
much
experience
with
heart
attacks
i
didn
t
say
it
was
a
heart
attack
said
poor
dolly
torn
by
her
knowledge
of
what
had
really
caused
the
trouble
it
must
have
been
from
what
you
say
that
s
what
i
mean
you
are
too
young
and
inexperienced
to
attend
alone
on
a
suffering
victim
of
heart
disease
why
didn
t
you
call
some
help
i
did
want
to
sir
but
miss
partland
wouldn
t
let
you
may
go
return
to
the
class
and
tell
them
they
are
dismissed
let
them
all
go
to
their
next
recitation
at
the
proper
yes
stop
a
dolly
turned
do
you
know
anything
more
about
this
affair
than
you
have
told
me
dolly
hesitated
what
should
she
do
she
did
know
more
about
it
she
knew
of
the
joke
the
boys
had
made
up
and
she
felt
almost
sure
that
it
was
owing
to
this
foolish
jest
that
miss
partland
had
imagined
she
felt
ill
so
vividly
that
at
last
she
really
did
feel
so
and
yet
if
dolly
peached
on
the
boys
she
well
knew
what
they
would
think
of
her
it
was
a
hard
position
but
she
thought
quickly
it
couldn
t
help
miss
partland
to
tell
of
the
joke
now
and
then
again
the
illness
might
not
have
been
caused
by
the
joke
after
all
dolly
had
been
so
engrossed
with
her
difficult
problem
that
she
had
not
seen
the
successive
boys
and
girls
look
at
miss
partland
with
such
evident
sympathy
anxiety
and
even
consternation
her
hesitation
naturally
made
the
principal
think
she
was
withholding
some
information
of
importance
and
he
said
so
no
macintosh
said
dolly
firmly
i
do
not
feel
sure
that
i
am
the
only
thing
i
know
is
not
positively
connected
with
miss
partland
s
illness
although
it
may
be
but
as
i
am
not
sure
i
am
not
justified
in
even
speaking
of
it
to
the
principal
looked
at
her
attentively
you
re
a
queer
child
he
said
yes
i
am
replied
dolly
thoughtfully
but
i
m
trying
to
see
what
is
my
duty
and
i
can
t
say
anything
till
i
find
at
any
rate
you
re
an
honest
little
girl
and
i
don
t
believe
you
know
anything
that
you
really
ought
to
tell
or
you
d
tell
oh
thank
you
sir
that
s
just
it
i
think
i
ought
to
or
i
dismissed
from
the
room
dolly
returned
to
the
class
and
told
them
the
lesson
would
not
be
resumed
that
day
as
miss
partland
had
gone
home
she
looked
reproachfully
at
the
boys
who
had
been
in
the
joke
and
at
celia
ferris
too
who
had
also
been
a
party
to
it
but
as
there
were
many
in
the
class
who
knew
nothing
about
it
no
word
was
said
then
and
there
nor
could
there
be
until
after
school
then
dolly
told
what
had
happened
and
to
think
she
concluded
that
miss
partland
was
not
ill
at
all
but
so
many
remarks
on
her
looking
poorly
made
her
think
she
was
was
pooh
nonsense
said
lollie
henry
you
can
t
make
a
lady
ill
by
telling
her
she
doesn
t
look
quite
up
to
the
yes
you
can
declared
dolly
it
s
what
they
call
or
something
just
the
same
way
if
you
tell
anybody
they
look
well
why
then
they
get
well
i
ve
heard
mother
talk
about
well
then
said
tod
brown
all
we
ve
got
to
do
is
to
go
around
to
miss
partland
s
house
and
tell
her
she
s
looking
as
blooming
as
a
peach
sure
said
tad
that
s
dead
easy
come
no
said
dolly
you
can
t
rush
off
like
that
you
d
probably
make
her
well
what
does
she
want
then
oh
tad
you
re
so
silly
and
dolly
couldn
t
help
laughing
at
him
i
think
you
re
silly
dolly
said
celia
i
don
t
believe
it
was
our
joke
that
upset
her
at
all
i
believe
she
d
been
sick
no
she
wouldn
t
she
said
she
was
perfectly
well
this
morning
you
know
celia
that
it
was
your
speeches
one
after
another
that
scared
her
into
thinking
she
was
and
it
was
enough
to
too
why
i
wasn
t
noticing
at
the
time
i
was
studying
but
dot
told
me
afterward
how
you
all
told
her
she
looked
so
terrible
and
you
pretended
to
be
scared
to
death
well
you
said
the
same
thing
to
her
yes
but
i
meant
it
by
the
time
i
went
up
to
the
board
you
had
all
frightened
her
so
she
was
white
and
i
was
sure
she
was
going
to
yes
dolly
was
in
earnest
said
dotty
if
we
did
any
harm
doll
can
t
be
included
when
she
said
that
to
miss
partland
it
was
true
when
we
said
it
it
wasn
oh
i
m
not
sticking
myself
up
began
dolly
and
i
m
not
blaming
the
rest
of
you
i
think
it
was
a
mean
joke
but
never
mind
that
now
what
i
m
thinking
of
is
what
we
ought
to
do
seems
if
we
ought
to
set
matters
right
i
don
t
think
so
said
celia
it
s
always
better
to
let
well
enough
alone
my
mother
says
i
bet
that
by
morning
miss
partland
will
be
all
right
and
will
have
forgotten
all
about
this
i
bet
she
will
too
said
lollie
say
dolly
don
t
worry
over
it
it
wasn
t
your
fault
anyway
and
i
don
t
believe
it
will
make
old
party
really
ill
it

and
it

i
heard
macintosh
tell
another
teacher
that

gone
home
because
she
had
a
heart
attack
in
the
i
don
t
believe
it
was
her
heart
at
all
said
dolly
slowly
why
should
any
one
think
so
it
was
only
nervousness
caused
by
your
foolish
trick
i
m
sorry
for
miss
partland
if
she
isn
t
all
right
i
m
going
to
tell

the
whole
meany

celia

awful
mean

retorted
dolly
and
then
she
and
dotty
had
reached
their
homes
and
went
in
while
the
others
went
on
their
way
chapter
iii
an
afternoon
call
dolly
worried
a
good
deal
over
her
teacher
s
illness
and
when
miss
partland
was
not
at
school
the
next
day
she
decided
to
go
to
see
her
on
the
way
home
the
boys
tried
to
dissuade
her
but
dolly
was
firm
no
use
trying
to
steer
off
dolly
fayre
if
she
s
made
up
her
mind
said
lollie
henry
if
she
has
a
bee
in
her
bonnet
she
sticks
to
it
like
a
puppy
to
a
they
all
laughed
at
this
but
dotty
said
earnestly
don
t
go
doll
you
ll
have
to
tell
on
the
boys
and
girls
and
that
will
be
awful
no
i
won
t
i
ve
a
plan
of
my
own
and
i
won
t
say
a
word
about
your
playing
a
joke
or
anything
about
any
of
you
but
i
do
think
lollie
and
you
tad
and
tod
too
that
it
s
a
mean
horrid
thing
to
play
practical
jokes
and
i
think

to
be
told
on
i
won
t
tell
on
ah
now
dolly
towhead
dolly
don
t
be
hard
on
us
said
tad
in
such
a
wheedlesome
way
that
dolly
had
to
laugh
we
didn
t
mean
any
real
harm
and
she
been
awfully
cross
to
us
and
we
re
not
such
angels
of
goodness
as
you
i
m
not
an
angel
of
goodness
tad
brown
and
i
ll
thank
you
to
stop
making
fun
of
me
but
i
do
believe
in
being
decent
to
a
teacher
even
if
she
is
strict
in
her
come
on
dolly
said
dotty
as
they
neared
the
street
where
miss
partland
lived
if
you
re
going
i
ll
go
with
oh
ho
jeered
lollie
little
angels
of
goodness
little
white
angels
with
shiny
wings
well
fly
into
old
party
s
house
and
see
what
s
the
matter
with
her
or
measles
the
two
girls
went
to
the
house
and
were
invited
to
go
up
to
the
teacher
s
room
they
found
miss
partland
sitting
in
an
easy
chair
looking
disconsolate
indeed
how
do
you
do
girls
she
said
listlessly
won
t
you
sit
down
the
two
d
s
sat
down
and
dolly
said
at
once
oh
i
m
glad
to
see
you
looking
so
much
better
miss
partland
you
re
not
really
ill
are
you
i
don
t
know
dolly
and
the
poor
lady
looked
sadly
distraught
she
was
not
an
interesting
invalid
in
appearance
she
had
on
an
old
grey
flannel
wrapper
and
her
hair
was
untidy
a
bowl
of
broth
cold
one
or
two
bottles
were
on
her
table
and
the
whole
room
had
an
unkempt
air
you
see
she
went
on
i
didn
t
know
i
had
heart
trouble
and
it
worries
me
do
you
know
it
yet
asked
dolly
have
you
had
a
doctor
i
ve
sent
for
him
but
he
hasn
t
come
yet
but
several
people
have
called
or
telephoned
and
they
all
speak
of
my
heart
attack
so
i
think
it
must
have
been
dotty
looked
very
serious
and
blushed
a
little
as
she
realised
to
what
a
pass
their
thoughtless
joke
had
brought
the
teacher
miss
partland
dolly
went
on
i
don
t
believe
it
was
your
heart
or
you
d
be
sicker
now
you
don
t
feel
bad
do
you
guess
not
can
hardly
well
you
look
real
well
to
oh
do
i
i
m
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
i
thought
myself
if
it
were
anything
serious
i
d
feel
worse
than
i
do
i
haven
t
any
real
pain
you
that
s
good
and
i
believe
all
you
want
is
to
brace
up
and
forget
it
forget
that
little
bother
of
yesterday
i
say
miss
partland
broke
in
dotty
won
t
you
let
me
do
your
hair
in
a
new
way
that
i
ve
just
tried
on
mother
s
i
often
do
her
hair
for
her
and
she
says
it
rests
her
a
lot
and
this
new
mercy
child
i
never
had
anybody
touch
my
hair
in
my
life
then
you
don
t
know
how
it
helps
just
let
me
try
where
s
your
comb
and
hairpins
oh
here
they
are
no
don
t
face
the
mirror
i
want
you
to
be
dotty
bustled
around
and
almost
before
miss
partland
knew
it
she
was
having
her
hair
dressed
by
the
skilful
little
hands
the
hair
was
not
long
or
luxurious
but
it
was
of
fine
texture
and
when
released
from
the
tight
little
knob
it
was
wound
in
proved
slightly
wavy
dot
made
the
most
of
it
and
drawing
it
up
in
a
soft
french
twist
she
puffed
it
out
at
the
sides
and
made
a
most
becoming
and
transforming
coiffure
there
she
said
you
re
real
pretty
now
and
i
d
like
to
see
anybody
say
you
look
sick
miss
partland
looked
in
the
glass
and
was
astounded
the
unwonted
performance
had
brought
the
colour
to
her
cheeks
and
interest
to
her
eyes
and
when
she
saw
the
whole
effect
in
the
mirror
she
fairly
beamed
with
delight
now
haven
t
you
a
nicer
kimono
or
dressing
gown
this
isn
t
very
pretty
for
afternoon
and
the
doctor
coming
and
miss
partland
looked
amazed
i
never
thought
about
it
she
said
i
haven
t
any
other
that
i
have
one
my
sister
sent
me
for
christmas
but
i
ve
never
worn
it
it
s
too
mayn
t
we
see
it
miss
partland
went
to
the
closet
and
brought
out
a
big
box
from
it
she
took
a
beautiful
japanese
kimono
of
pale
blue
silk
embroidered
with
pink
chrysanthemums
there
she
said
you
see
i
couldn
t
wear
why
not
cried
dolly
it
s
lovely
and
it
just
suits
your
blonde
this
was
stretching
the
point
a
little
for
miss
partland
s
blondeness
was
of
the
type
known
as
ash
and
her
faded
complexion
and
dull
light
blue
eyes
hardly
deserved
the
name
of
colouring
but
dolly
was
sincere
and
she
meant
to
make
the
most
of
what
little
natural
vanity
the
lady
possessed
yes
indeed
chimed
in
dotty
that
s
too
pretty
to
be
buried
in
an
old
dark
closet
put
it
on
quick
before
the
doctor
gets
here
a
little
bewildered
miss
partland
hurried
into
the
robe
and
the
girls
were
astounded
at
the
becomingness
of
it
well
well
cried
dotty
try
our
plans
and
you
will
be
surprised
at
the
result
why
miss
partland
you
re
a
hummer
a
regular
peach
isn
t
she
doll
and
dolly
patted
the
blue
silk
approvingly
then
they
wound
the
blue
sash
that
belonged
to
the
robe
round
about
her
and
tucked
the
ends
in
in
chinese
fashion
you
must
put
that
on
every
day
after
school
said
dotty
it
s
lovely
on
but
it
s
too
nice
i
never
dreamed
of
wearing
no
matter
just
you
wear
it
and
when
it
s
worn
out
i
spect
sister
ll
give
you
of
course
she
would
she
s
awfully
fond
of
she
d
be
fonder
if
she
could
see
you
now
clothes
make
a
heap
of
difference
and
dotty
nodded
her
head
sagely
my
goodness
here
s
the
doctor
i
hear
his
automobile
stopping
yes
it
is
as
she
peeped
from
the
window
shall
we
go
home
miss
partland
no
just
go
in
the
next
room
and
after
he
s
gone
i
ll
tell
you
what
he
oh
thank
you
i
do
want
to
know
said
dolly
and
the
two
ran
into
the
next
room
and
shut
the
door
a
little
time
later
miss
partland
opened
the
door
and
summoned
them
she
was
smiling
and
so
happy
looking
that
she
was
almost
pretty
word
rarely
used
in
connection
with
the
geometry
teacher
come
in
girls
she
said
the
doctor
says
i
have
no
heart
trouble
of
any
sort
and
that
i
am
as
sound
as
a
dollar
did
he
say
what
ailed
you
yesterday
he
said
i
was
probably
nervous
over
some
trifle
but
he
said
it
had
left
no
trace
for
my
nerves
are
all
right
now
and
what
do
you
think
he
said
that
as
i
had
enough
interest
in
life
to
take
some
pains
with
my
toilette
i
was
in
no
danger
of
nervous
prostration
and
just
think
before
you
two
came
in
i
was
wondering
whether
i
d
better
go
to
a
sanitarium
oh
miss
partland
not
really
yes
really
i
thought
my
whole
nervous
system
was
shattered
everybody
said
i
looked
so
ill
and
they
gave
me
such
commiserating
well
they
won
t
any
more
interrupted
dotty
who
was
cut
to
the
soul
by
these
remarks
well
she
knew
whose
suggestions
and
whose
glances
had
brought
about
the
sad
state
of
things
and
now
said
practical
dolly
i
m
going
to
straighten
up
this
room
a
little
you
may
have
more
she
whisked
away
the
bowl
and
bottles
into
the
bathroom
she
straightened
the
shades
dusted
a
little
and
with
a
few
deft
touches
here
and
there
she
made
the
room
tidy
and
neat
she
found
a
glass
vase
which
she
washed
and
setting
it
on
the
table
said
we
must
go
now
miss
partland
but
i
m
going
to
send
you
a
few
flowers
and
i
want
you
to
put
them
in
this
vase
and
set
them
right
here
on
the
table
will
you
indeed
i
will
you
dear
child
you
re
dear
little
girls
both
and
i
can
t
tell
you
how
grateful
i
am
to
you
for
your
pleasant
call
i
can
t
promise
to
wear
this
elaborate
gown
every
day
but
i
will
buy
myself
one
that
is
more
presentable
than
the
one
i
had
on
when
you
and
have
it
pretty
miss
partland
begged
dolly
pretty
things
keep
you
from
getting
i
wonder
if
they
do
you
little
rascal
how
do
you
know
well
maybe
they
wouldn
t
keep
you
from
getting
chicken
pox
they
didn
t
me
but
i
m
just
sure
they
re
good
for
nervous
i
shouldn
t
wonder
a
bit
and
miss
partland
smiled
brightly
as
she
bade
the
girls
now
i
m
going
to
get
her
some
flowers
said
dolly
as
they
reached
the
street
i
haven
t
much
left
of
my
allowance
but
i
can
get
her
half
a
dozen
carnations
or
two
roses
which
would
you
dot
carnations
i
guess
they
last
longer
i
m
going
to
get
her
a
couple
of
fruits
say
a
grapefruit
and
an
orange
how
s
that
fine
i
m
glad
you
thought
of
it
it
ll
cheer
her
a
lot
i
say
dot
we
did
do
her
some
i
should
say
we
did
but
it
was
all
your
doing
i
just
went
nonsense
you
did
as
much
as
i
did
why
i
don
t
know
how
you
ever
thought
of
fussing
up
her
hair
it
was
just
the
thing
but
it
never
would
have
occurred
to
i
dunno
myself
how
i
happened
to
think
of
it
but
her
old
head
looked
so
frowsy
and
untidy
i
wanted
to
see
if
it
would
make
a
difference
and
it
did
i
should
say
so
here
s
the
fruit
store
going
in
yes
come
they
went
in
and
dotty
made
a
judicious
selection
of
two
oranges
and
a
bunch
of
white
grapes
as
they
were
not
sure
miss
partland
cared
for
grapefruit
and
if
any
one
like
it
said
dotty
making
a
wry
face
they
don
t
like
it
all
over
can
t
abide
it
i
love
it
returned
dolly
but
as
you
say
dot
if
people
don
t
like
it
they
don
t
grapes
are
much
safer
now
come
on
to
the
flower
a
half
dozen
carnations
of
an
exquisite
shade
were
available
for
the
money
dolly
had
and
it
was
with
great
satisfaction
she
saw
them
put
in
a
box
and
sent
off
at
once
to
miss
partland
i
say
dolly
you
re
an
awful
trump
declared
dotty
as
they
walked
along
i
never
should
have
thought
of
going
to
fix
things
up
with
old
party
and
now
i
m
awful
glad
we
did
why
is
it
you
always
have
these
good
thinks
and
i
never
do
i
dunno
sometimes
it
makes
me
mad
though
when
the
boys
call
me
and
celia
ferris
said
i
was
a
spoilsport
that
isn
t
very
nice
to
be
called
dot
is
it
no
but
you
always
come
out
all
right
you
see
i
m
full
of
the
dickens
and
when
the
boys
want
me
to
cut
up
jinks
i
go
into
it
head
over
heels
without
thinking
you
hesitate
and
think
it
over
and
then
you
do
the
right
oh
i
don
t
know
sometimes
i
think
maybe
i
an
old
primmy
as
tad
calls
me
hello
here
s
tad
tad
brown
met
them
as
he
came
flying
round
a
corner
closely
followed
by
his
twin
brother
tod
hello
girls
tad
called
out
been
to
old
party
s
how
is
she
she
s
all
right
and
dolly
laughed
gaily
she
s
had
the
doctor
and
he
says
her
heart
s
sound
as
a
dollar
so
you
see
your
old
joke
didn
t
hurt
her
after
but
it
would
have
put
in
dotty
if
doll
hadn
t
gone
there
and
chirked
her
up
and
told
her
she
wasn
t
sick
at
you
went
too
said
dolly
laughing
oh
course
whithersoever
thou
goest
theresoever
will
i
also
went
and
say
boys
you
ve
got
to
be
gooder
n
pie
and
every
day
to
make
up
to
old
party
for
your
badness
she
s
a
funny
old
thing
but
she
s
nice
and
since
i
ve
seen
her
at
home
i
feel
different
toward
her
more
intimate
like
and
sorry
for
all
right
said
tad
heartily
i
m
ready
to
be
good
i
m
pretty
well
ashamed
of
that
old
joke
business
since
it
turned
out
so
me
too
and
tod
shook
his
head
i
thought
it
was
funny
at
first
but
it
didn
t
pan
out
well
i
ll
never
play
another
joke
on
anybody
any
way
not
till
the
next
time
going
to
the
high
school
dance
girls
yes
indeedy
and
dolly
s
eyes
glistened
won
t
it
be
fun
it
is
the
first
time
i
ve
ever
been
to
an
evening
go
with
me
and
tod
paused
in
the
street
and
swept
his
best
bow
gracious
i
don
t
know
said
dolly
overcome
at
this
sudden
i
don
t
believe
mother
will
let
me
go
with
a
oh
yes
she
will
said
tad
just
to
a
school
dance
you
go
with
tod
dolly
and
dot
you
go
with
me
and
then
we
ll
be
all
in
the
same
i
d
like
to
said
dolly
but
i
m
sure
mother
won
t
let
me
what
do
you
think
dot
i
think
my
mother
will
muchly
object
at
first
but
i
think
i
can
coax
her
into
why
all
the
girls
will
go
with
the
boys
said
tad
eagerly
they
always
do
you
see
our
bunch

never
been
in
high
school
before
and
when
we
re
in

said
he
was
going
to
ask
oh
do
you
boys
talk
it
all
over
who
you
ll
take
i
mean
sure
we
do
said
tod
grinning
i
gave
joe
my
new
knife
if
he
d
let
me
ask
you
you
didn
t
and
dolly
looked
shocked
no
of
course
he
didn
t
said
tad
don
t
you
let
him
fool
you
the
quartette
had
walked
along
to
the
fayres
house
and
the
boys
wanted
to
go
in
and
see
how
the
house
was
coming
on
but
dolly
wouldn
t
allow
this
as
she
said
she
must
study
her
lessons
and
you
must
all
go
home
and
study
she
said
shaking
her
golden
head
at
them
i
want
you
to
have
good
lessons
and
cheer
miss
party
i
ll
tell
her
she
s
looking
blooming
said
tad
laughing
over
his
shoulder
as
he
went
away
i
ll
tell
her
she
s
a
perfect
peach
declared
tod
and
then
with
gay
they
parted
chapter
iv
the
high
school
dance
oh
i
don
t
know
said
fayre
doubtfully
when
dolly
asked
her
about
going
to
the
dance
with
tod
you
re
not
old
enough
to
go
to
an
evening
party
with
an
escort
why
you
re
only
but
this
is
a
school
party
mumsie
and
it
seems
i
think
so
too
said
trudy
i
went
to
high
school
parties
with
the
boys
when
i
was
fifteen
sixteen
but
sixteen
seems
so
much
older
why
dolly
s
wearing
well
and
trudy
laughed
they
ll
allow
hair
ribbons
at
a
high
school
dance
why
mother
it
s
part
of
the
course
in
a
way
it
teaches
the
boys
and
girls
how
to
behave
in
dolly
can
learn
that
at
not
unless
she
has
lots
of
parties
and
dances
i
mean
party
well
i
m
willing
she
should
go
but
i
don
t
like
her
going
with
tod
why
he
s
an
awfully
nice
boy
the
browns
are
among
the
best
people
of
i
know
that
trudy
s
all
right
but
i
think
your
father
ought
to
take
dolly
and
go
after
oh
mother
they
don
t
do
that
nowadays
but
dolly
can
go
in
our
car
and
stop
for
tod
that
would
be
all
right
and
thomas
could
go
and
bring
them
that
seems
to
me
a
very
queer
way
to
do
but
we
ll
see
what
your
father
says
about
fayre
appealed
to
was
helpless
why
bless
my
soul
edith
he
said
to
his
wife
i
don
t
know
about
such
things
when
i
was
a
boy
we
went
home
with
the
girls
of
course
but
nowadays
i
suppose
the
ways
are
different
you
women
folks
ought
to
be
able
to
settle
that
they
are
daddy
said
dolly
sidling
up
to
him
and
patting
his
hand
but
i
d
just
as
lieve
you
d
take
me
if
you
want
the
bother
of
i
don
t
mind
the
bother
chickadee
if
it
s
necessary
but
when
you
get
old
enough
to
let
the
brownies
take
you
to
parties
i
shan
t
be
sorry
well
now
i
ll
settle
the
matter
said
fayre
smiling
at
her
younger
daughter
this
time
let
daddy
take
you
and
the
next
time
we
ll
see
about
it
you
growing
up
i
suppose
and
too
one
has
to
do
as
other
people
do
but
this
first
dance
i
d
rather
you
went
with
all
right
mumsie
i
m
willing
i
don
t
s
pose
it
ll
be
much
of
a
party
anyhow
just
the
school
girls
and
boys
you
oh
i
don
t
know
said
trudy
when
i
went
to
high
dances
were
pretty
nice
affairs
what
shall
she
wear
i
don
t
know
replied
fayre
i
ll
have
to
ask
the
mothers
of
some
of
the
other
girls
how
much
they
dress
a
white
frock
i
should
think
with
some
flowers
or
dolly
was
satisfied
with
the
outcome
of
the
discussion
but
quite
another
scene
was
being
enacted
next
door
i
m
going
to
the
high
school
dance
with
tad
brown
dotty
announced
at
the
dinner
table
you
ll
do
nothing
of
the
sort
returned
her
mother
a
child
of
your
age
going
out
in
the
evening
with
a
boy
escort
ridiculous
but
i
went
on
dotty
decidedly
dolly
s
going
with
tod
and
i
m
going
with
did
dolly
s
mother
say
she
might
i
dunno
but
we
re
going
and
i
want
a
new
red
chiffon
to
red
chiffon
you
d
look
fine
in
red
chiffon
at
your
age
now
be
sensible
dotty
if
you
go
to
that
dance
you
must
let
your
father
take
you
and
you
must
wear
one
of
your
white
summer
but
mother
all
the
girls
are
going
to
have
new
dresses
celia
ferris
is
going
to
have
a
white
a
white
satin
for
a
high
school
girl
how
absurd
well
i
don
t
want
white
satin
but
i
want
a
new
dress
can
t
i
have
it
father
now
now
dotty
don
t
but
father
can
t
i
why
should
think
you
might
you
re
a
nice
little
girl
but
of
course
it
must
be
as
mother
say
yes
mother
do
say
yes
won
t
you
mother
you
aunt
clara
you
her
to
won
t
you
you
aunt
clara
good
gracious
child
stop
teasing
and
rose
glowered
at
dotty
so
very
fiercely
that
she
knew
he
was
not
in
earnest
stop
teasing
dotty
said
genie
her
little
sister
you
know
very
well
that
teasing
won
t
get
what
you
genie
looked
so
comical
as
she
shook
her
fat
little
forefinger
at
dotty
that
they
all
laughed
cry
that
s
the
bestest
way
genie
went
on
if
you
cry
hard
enough
you
re
sure
to
get
that
s
all
right
for
little
kiddies
like
you
gene
but
big
girls
don
t
cry
they
just
say
what
they
want
and
then
if
their
parents
are
nice
loving
affectionate
people
i
should
think
they
would
get
their
well
put
dottikins
cried
her
father
i
guess
mother
the
little
girl
will
have
to
have
her
new
furbelows
of
course
you
ll
get
something
suitable
say
a
nice
blue
dotty
smiled
absently
at
this
mild
jest
and
went
on
her
first
point
gained
to
her
second
and
i
want
to
go
with
tad
i
don
t
want
to
go
with
father
like
a
baby
all
the
girls
are
going
with
the
boys
celia
ferris
is
going
with
lollie
that
question
must
wait
dorothy
and
when
rose
used
that
name
dotty
knew
she
was
very
much
in
earnest
i
m
comparatively
new
in
berwick
and
i
must
find
out
what
the
other
mothers
think
about
it
before
i
decide
now
stop
teasing
after
i
confer
with
some
of
the
ladies
i
ll
decide
i
don
t
think
much
of
celia
ferris
as
a
model
and
i
m
by
no
means
sure
dolly
s
mother
will
let
her
go
with
tod
so
you
must
wait
and
dotty
knew
from
her
mother
s
manner
there
was
no
use
teasing
any
more
so
she
turned
her
attention
back
to
her
frock
well
if
it
can
t
be
red
chiffon
mother
can
t
it
be
red
organdie
we
ll
see
about
it
if
you
re
so
bent
on
a
red
dress
perhaps
we
can
hunt
one
fayre
smiled
at
her
impetuous
daughter
and
dotty
felt
sure
she
had
secured
a
red
gown
at
least
the
two
neighbouring
mothers
talked
matters
over
and
it
was
finally
decided
that
the
girls
should
not
be
allowed
to
go
to
the
party
with
the
boys
this
time
but
perhaps
they
might
later
in
the
season
for
the
dances
were
occasional
and
sometimes
there
were
three
or
four
during
the
winter
it
was
arranged
that
fayre
should
take
the
two
d
s
and
that
rose
should
go
to
bring
them
home
after
the
dance
was
over
but
new
dresses
were
allowed
and
dotty
s
of
red
organdie
and
dolly
s
of
white
organdie
and
blue
ribbons
were
both
pretty
and
appropriate
they
had
new
party
cloaks
too
the
first
they
had
ever
owned
and
it
made
them
feel
exceedingly
to
have
them
flung
round
their
shoulders
dolly
s
was
of
light
blue
cashmere
edged
with
swansdown
and
dotty
s
was
of
scarlet
cloth
bordered
with
a
quilling
of
black
satin
hats
were
out
of
the
question
and
fayre
presented
each
of
the
girls
with
a
little
lace
scarf
to
wear
on
her
head
very
pretty
they
looked
as
all
equipped
at
last
they
got
into
the
fayre
car
and
rolled
away
fayre
gave
them
alternately
compliments
on
their
appearance
and
advice
as
to
how
to
behave
why
dads
said
dolly
laughing
any
one
would
think
we
had
never
been
out
well
you
haven
t
that
is
to
a
real
evening
no
but
we
went
to
a
dance
down
at
surfwood
it
can
t
be
so
very
no
i
suppose
not
rejoined
fayre
and
then
they
were
at
the
school
the
dance
was
held
in
the
big
assembly
room
and
the
committee
had
decorated
it
with
flowers
and
palms
so
that
it
had
a
gala
air
indeed
the
girls
went
to
the
cloak
room
and
as
they
emerged
the
brown
twins
met
them
such
dressy
brown
twins
and
indeed
everybody
looked
different
from
the
schoolmates
they
were
hello
said
tad
come
on
you
re
late
the
girls
are
getting
their
cards
all
filled
up
here
are
the
two
d
s
took
their
dance
programmes
a
little
shyly
they
had
never
had
them
before
for
this
was
their
first
real
dance
party
s
pose
nobody
asks
me
to
dance
said
dotty
in
a
sudden
fit
of
shyness
oh
nonsense
cried
dolly
everybody
ll
ask
you
should
worry
exclaimed
tad
looking
at
his
pretty
partner
with
an
appreciative
eye
here
give
me
both
your
cards
i
want
a
lot
of
dances
that
i
can
manage
i
m
not
much
on
the
fancy
he
took
the
cards
and
began
scribbling
his
initials
stop
said
dotty
laughing
you
re
taking
too
many
oh
ho
and
you
were
so
fraid
nobody
d
ask
you
you
re
a
well
i
want
a
few
left
if
anybody
ask
and
even
as
she
spoke
several
of
the
boys
came
clustering
round
her
and
dolly
and
very
soon
their
cards
were
well
filled
then
the
fun
began
the
two
d
s
were
both
good
dancers
and
as
nearly
all
the
young
people
went
to
the
berwick
dancing
school
they
had
plenty
of
good
partners
after
each
dance
they
walked
about
the
room
or
sat
and
chatted
to
dolly
s
surprise
there
were
a
great
many
strangers
present
for
contrary
to
the
ideas
of
the
elder
fayres
and
roses
nearly
all
the
girls
did
come
with
boy
escorts
and
as
many
girls
were
not
invited
by
the
schoolboys
they
asked
friends
from
out
of
town
there
were
also
girl
guests
from
neighbouring
cities
and
altogether
the
affair
was
quite
large
celia
ferris
had
her
white
satin
but
it
was
veiled
with
soft
white
tulle
and
made
a
very
pretty
girlish
celia
was
chummy
with
the
two
d
s
but
she
had
begun
to
feel
a
little
jealous
of
them
for
they
were
exceedingly
popular
and
received
a
great
deal
of
attention
however
she
was
and
spoke
cordially
with
them
whenever
they
met
after
a
time
dolly
noticed
a
girl
who
seemed
to
be
a
she
was
a
and
girl
but
she
danced
very
seldom
and
most
of
the
time
sat
discontentedly
looking
at
the
others
there
were
some
other
as
is
always
the
case
but
none
were
so
frequently
left
partnerless
as
this
particular
girl
who
is
she
asked
dolly
of
lollie
henry
with
whom
she
happened
to
be
dancing
oh
that
s
bernice
forbes
she
s
a
don
t
be
rude
lollie
what
do
you
mean
muff
nothing
only
she
hasn
t
any
to
her
life
any
vim
you
but
she
might
if
she
were
asked
to
dance
oftener
have
you
asked
her
not
much
i
don
t
dance
with
forbes
when
i
can
get
anybody
that
isn
t
very
nice
of
you
and
dolly
looked
reproachfully
at
her
partner
won
t
you
ask
her
once
just
to
please
me
i
d
do
a
lot
to
please
you
sister
but
is
a
little
too
much
hello

own
lollie
went
off
and
tod
escorted
dolly
to
the
supper
room
the
feast
was
not
grand
as
high
school
affairs
are
limited
but
everybody
enjoyed
it
the
d
s
and
the
browns
found
a
place
in
a
pleasant
alcove
and
were
joined
by
celia
ferris
and
the
rawlins
girls
and
a
lot
more
of
their
particular
friends
dolly
noticed
bernice
forbes
sitting
apart
from
the
rest
with
her
was
a
boy
dolly
did
not
know
who
is
he
she
whispered
to
joe
collins
dunno
some
chap
the
forbes
girl
brought
of
course
no
berwick
boy
would
ask
why
not
stick
can
t
say
boo
to
a
goose

that
the
reason
the
berwick
boys

t
want

dolly
mischievously
and
joe
laughed

at

the

when

house

the
finishing
touches
that
the
eager
hands
of
the
two
d
s
were
ready
to
give
a
saturday
was
to
be
devoted
to
this
fascinating
work
and
bright
and
early
dotty
and
dolly
were
signalling
each
other
from
their
bedroom
windows
that
the
time
had
arrived

slim
and
very
hurried

breakfasts
and
very
abstracted
and
absentminded
their
conversation
dot
said
rose

little
scrap

nice
dotty
looked
at
her
father
unseeing
and
letting

so
and
dotty
nodded
her
head
meanwhile
rose

sat
patiently
serving

and
spoon
held
over
the
dish
of
curly
crisp
bacon
and
golden
eggs
i
asked
you
a
question
dotty
he
said
in
an
injured
tone
again
dotty
gave
him
that
blank
stare
and
mother
she
went

dotty
grabbed
up
some
things
she
had
ready
to
take
and
the
two
flew
out
of
the
side
door
and
over
to
treasure
house
it
was
a
gorgeous
morning
in
late
october
and
as
the
house
faced
the
south
the
sun
was
already
flooding
the
front
piazza
of
their
new
domain
each
girl
had
a
key
and
as
they
went
up
the
steps
dolly
began
hunting
in
her
coat
pocket
for
hers
old
slowy
cried
dotty
and
her
own
key
already
in
her
hand
she
snapped
it
into
the
lock
and
threw
open
the
door
will
you
walk
into
my
parlour
said
the
flyder
to
the
spy
and
with
a
flourish
she
stood
aside
for
dolly
to
enter
no
we
must
go
in
together
why
dot
this
first
entrance
ought
to
be
a
rite
ceremonial
you
ceremonial
your
grandmother
come
on
in
and
grabbing
dolly
s
arm
the
two
bounced
in
spilling
their
parcels
and
laughing
so
hard
that
there
was
small
suggestion
of
ceremony
they
fell
breathless
in
the
two
easy
chairs
that
stood
either
side
of
the
fireplace
and
just
grinned
at
each
other
the
day
s
come
exclaimed
dotty
we
re
really
here
oh
doll
can
you
believe
it
no
i
simpully
it
s
too
good
to
be
true
now
shall
we
light
a
fire
or
fix
things
up
first
how
far
have
you
progressed
asked
a
voice
at
the
door
and
rose
came
in
smiling
want
any
help
i
ve
half
an
hour
to
spare
can
i
start
a
fire
for
you
oh
do
dad
and
show
us
just
how
and
then
we
can
do
it
ourselves
after
pooh
said
dolly
i
know
how
to
make
a
fire
learned
long
ago
but
it
would
be
better
to
have
rose
make
the
first
one
and
see
if
the
chimney
draws
all
dolly
looked
up
the
flue
with
the
air
of
a
connoisseur
on
fireplaces
and
rose
laughed
good
naturedly
at
her
the
secret
of
a
successful
fire
is
plenty
of
paper
and
he
said
as
he
twisted
newspapers
into
hard
rolls
then
he
added
light
sticks
and
finally
logs
and
declared
the
fire
was
laid
now
the
lighting
of
this
your
first
hearth
fire
should
be
a
ceremony
he
said
there
dotty
i
told
you
we
ought
to
have
a
ceremony
which
of
us
will
light
it
both
together
of
course
give
us
each
a
match
rose
gave
each
of
the
girls
a
match
and
as
they
were
about
to
strike
them
he
showed
them
where
to
touch
the
protruding
ends
of
paper
which
he
had
purposely
arranged
now
he
said
one
two
three
may
joy
attend
all
who
surround
the
hearthstone
fires
of
treasure
house
the
matches
blazed
caught
the
paper
ignited
the
kindling
and
flames
shot
up
with
a
glow
and
a
crackle
it
was
an
exciting
moment
for
the
two
girls
they
fell
into
each
other
s
arms
and
while
dotty
was
shouting
hooray
at
the
top
of
her
lungs
the
tears
were
rolling
down
dolly
s
cheeks
you
goosie
cried
dotty
what
under
the
sun
are
you
crying
about
cause
i
m
so
happy
and
anyway
it
s
my
own
house
i
ve
got
a
right
to
cry
in
it
if
i
want
but
she
was
smiling
now
the
tense
moment
had
passed
and
together
they
danced
wildly
round
the
room
i
ll
have
to
be
going
said
rose
looking
at
his
watch
you
two
apache
indians
had
better
calm
down
and
get
to
work
there
s
a
lot
to
be
done
i
m
but
we
ve
got
all
our
lives
to
do
it
in
said
dolly
laughing
there
s
no
hurry
and
i
must
get
my
eyes
used
to
it
a
little
rose
went
off
and
the
two
girls
stood
looking
about
as
if
they
never
could
look
enough
and
this
is
what
they
saw
the
study
flooded
with
the
autumn
sunlight
and
bright
with
the
blazing
fire
walls
hung
with
plain
paper
of
a
lovely
greyish
green
with
a
bordering
frieze
of
foliage
in
darker
shades
windows
curtained
with
green
silk
over
lace
bordered
scrim
two
wide
at
opposite
sides
of
the
room
cushioned
in
green
and
provided
with
many
soft
green
cushions
the
woodwork
was
white
the
low
bookshelves
were
white
and
the
furniture
was
mission
the
two
desks
had
arrived
and
were
placed
at
the
two
ends
of
the
room
theoretically
the
whole
room
was
divided
in
halves
dolly
owning
the
side
toward
her
home
and
dotty
the
side
toward
hers
under
the
window
seats
were
little
cupboards
for
school
books
and
besides
there
was
a
roomy
for
each
with
shelves
and
hooks
a
big
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
held
an
electrolier
and
each
girl
was
to
fill
her
side
of
the
table
with
such
books
or
as
she
saw
fit
altogether
it
was
the
cosiest
homiest
dearest
room
a
girl
ever
had
to
study
or
play
in
and
it
thoroughly
satisfied
the
two
d
s
now
let
s
gaze
on
the
said
dolly
i
haven
t
seen
it
since
last
arms
round
each
other
they
went
to
the
next
room
that
of
course
was
a
north
room
and
so
it
had
been
furnished
in
yellow
the
yellow
wallpaper
with
a
border
of
daffodils
was
like
sunshine
and
the
chairs
and
table
were
of
yellow
painted
wood
the
curtains
were
of
thin
yellow
silk
and
the
glass
door
of
the
cupboard
showed
a
set
of
yellow
china
a
big
yellow
bowl
of
chinese
ware
had
been
fayre

especial
gift

relatives
had
all
contributed
generously
to
the
furnishings
bob
and
bert
had
sent
gifts

one
a
picture
their
pictures
were
few
as
yet
for
the
girls
didn
t
want
the
discarded
ones

their
home

wait
till

christmas
or
birthday
gifts

enamel
fayre
was
a
busy
man
and
hadn
t
the
time
to
devote
to
the
children
that
rose
could
command
so
he
had
insisted
on
making
up
by
putting
in
the
entire
electrical
outfit
there
was
provision
for
cooking
toasting
and
some
contraptions
of
which
the
girls
did
not
yet
know
the
use
a
small
but
complete
kitchen
cabinet
contained
everything
the
most
fastidious
housekeeper
could
desire
and
a
wall
cupboard
held
a
supply
of
neatly
hemmed
dish
towels
dusters
and
such
matters
isn
t
it
great
exclaimed
dolly
that

enamelled

for
a
fairy

bath
and

mantel
and
all
right
say
we
a
basket
of
trinkets
from
each
house
stood
waiting
and
the
two
unpacked
and
placed
their
treasures
such
absorbing
work
as
it
was
no
very
valuable
things
had
been
brought
lest
gentry
should
prowl
round
some
dark
night
but
lots
of
pretty
things
were
available
course
we
divide
the

with
a
tiny
ivory
elephant
and
a

too
crowded
pooh
i
think
yours
is
too
skimpy
looks
awful
vacant
with
nothing
but
two
elephants
and
a
candlestick
but
it
s
right
not
to
have
such
a
lot
of
dinky
doodaddles
all
over
the
place
your
end
looks
like
a
junk
shop
but
imperturbably
dotty
added
a
big
conch
shell
and
a
fussy
beribboned
calendar
i
like
what
i
like
dolly
fayre
and
i
ve
as
much
right
to
fill
up
my
space
as

yours
you
might
rent
out
a
few
square
feet
to

bragh
dotty
executed
a
species
of
war
dance
and
shook
her
fist
defiantly
at
dolly
who
was
standing
off
admiring
her
end
of
the
mantel
and
making
wry
faces
at
dotty
s
suddenly
dolly
broke
into
laughter
we
ll
have
these
scraps
all
the

way

my
mantel
layout

pretty
fine

dolly

taste

matter
of
opinion
and
i
opine
that
my
mantel
looks
as
good
as
yours
only
then
both
girls
grinned
at
each
other
and
the
peace
was
unbroken
but
the
mantel
did
look
funny
now
for
our
books

after

maria
hurried
in
with
the
blanketed
bundle
which
proved
to
be
a
silver
pot
of
cocoa
steaming
and
fragrant
laughing
with
glee
the
girls
relieved
the
messengers
of
their
loads
and
put
them
all
on
the
table
the
callers
declined
to
stay
having
a
feeling
that
half
the
fun
of
treasure
house
was
in
the
two
d
s
having
it
to
themselves
so
away
they
went
and
with
shrieks
of
delight
the
donations
were
opened

a
picture
cried
dolly
as
she
brought
to
view
a
small
platter
of
cold
tongue
garnished
round
with
asparagus
tips
and
tiny
pickles
and
gaze
on

while

in
her
methodical
way
went
on
with
the

she
said

but
dolly
came
smiling
and
tranquil
and
took
her
seat
at
the
table
isn
t
it
great
she
said
looking
about
at
the
pretty
golden
room
the
tempting

set
forth
and
at
eager
dotty
her
dark
eyes
sparkling
and
her
red
lips
pouting
at
dolly
s
delay
simpully
gorgeous
and
dotty
s
pout
disappeared
as
they
began
the
first
meal
in
treasure
house
i
say
dollum
isn
t
it
funny
how
we
roses
came
here
and
happened
to
live
alongside
of
you
fayres
and
you
and
i
became
such
chums
awful
funny
and
we

such
good
friends
even
though
we
re
so
different
in
every
not
in
every
way
we
like
the
same
things
often
but
sometimes
we
re
so
very
different
it
makes
us
seem
differenter
than
we
really
yes
i
guess
that
s
it
though
i
can
t
exactly
follow
your
meaning
my
but
these
sandwiches
are
good
let
s
have
lunch
here
every
saturday
shall
us
of
course
we
ll
fix
the
things
ourselves
we
couldn
t
expect
trudy
and
your
aunt
clara
to
do
it
this
first
time
but
norah
and
maria
will
make
things
for
us
and
we
can
do
a
lot
ourselves
i
mean
to
learn
to
cook
so
much
cook
on
the
stove
you
know
to
make
sandwiches
and
salads
and
desserts
and
deviled
eggs
and
oh
dollyrinda
some
saturday
we
ll
ask
somebody
to
lunch
and
we
ll
make
all
the
things
ourselves
and
oh
dotsie
when
the
boys
come
home
for
thanksgiving
maybe
we
won
t
have
fun
brother
bert
is
crazy
to
see
this
and
bob
is
too
i
expect
those
two
brothers
of
ours
will
just
take
possession
of
deed
they
won
t
but
of
course
they
can
come
here
all
they
want
and
if
they
want
to
borrow
it
for
a
boy
racket
of
their
own
why
of
course
we
ll
let
well
isn
t
that
pretty
much
taking
possession
i
d
like
to
know
have
some
more
cocoa
you
mustn
t
say
have
some
anything
you
ought
to
say
have
some
cocoa
but
you
ve
already
had
some
i
know
it
but
that
s
good
manners
you
must
ignore
the
fact
of
my
having
had
pooh
well
miss
fayre
as
you
haven
t
had
any
cocoa
to
my
knowledge
mayn
t
i
beg
you
to
try
it
since
you
put
it
so
politely
i
don
t
care
if
i
do
take
another
cup
or
two
you
see
don
t
have
to
ignore
it
i
own
right
you
and
your
manners
are
too
much
for
me
but
honestly
dotty
it
is
right
not
to
put
in
the
and
you
mustn
t
do
all
right
i
won
t
but
it
s
simply
impossible
for
me
to
ignore
the
dozens
of
sandwiches
you
ve
eaten
so
i
ll
say
have
some
cake
as
the
sandwiches
are
all
gone
i
believe
i
will
begin
on
the
cake
but
somehow
i
don
t
feel
as
hungry
as
i
did
do
you
nixy
say
doll
here
s
an
idea
s
pose
we
save
these
cakes
s
a
lot
of
them
that
big
basket
of
fruit
till
this
afternoon
and
invite
the
two
rawlins
girls
over
how
about
it
all
right
i
ll
go
you
for
honest
i
can
t
eat
any
of
it
now
but
we
ll
eat
up
trudy
s
floating
island
she
makes
it
lovely
and
there
isn
t
such
a
lot
of
all
right
if
we
re
going
to
ask
those
girls
we
must
get
a
move
on
and
do
up
these
dishes
i
hate
to
do
dishes
don
t
you
yes
at
home
but
it
isn
t
so
bad
here
it
s
kind
of
fun
not
very
much
fun
but
anyway
the
dishes
that
belong
over
to
our
homes
we
can
pile
in
this
basket
and
maria
will
come
for
they
ve
got
to
be
washed
first
though
it
isn
t
nice
to
send
them
back
oh
what
a
prim
old
maid
you
ought
to
live
alone
with
a
cat
and
a
poll
parrot
that
isn
t
that
s
just
plain
tidiness
now
you
get
a
dish
towel
and
i
ll
wash
and
we
ll
have
these
things
put
to
rights
in
a
the
girls
knew
how
and
they
did
their
work
well
but
it
did
take
some
time
for
such
work
can
not
be
done
too
swiftly
but
on
the
whole
they
enjoyed
the
task
and
were
gratified
at
the
sight
of
the
shining
glass
and
china
in
their
own
and
the
neatly
packed
basket
and
tray
full
of
dishes
to
be
returned
to
their
home
pantries
then
they
went
and
sat
before
their
study
fire
to
rest
and
talk
seems
to
me
said
dolly
time
does
go
awful
fast
here
it
s
after
three
o
clock
and
the
afternoon
is
most
and
we
must
go
home
and
dress
said
dotty
if
we
re
going
to
have
grace
and
ethel
these
ginghams
won
t
no
not
in
our
pretty
new
house
well
let
s
go
home
and
dress
and
then
we
can
telephone
them
from
home
shall
i
do
it
or
you
oh
i
ll
do
it
you
ll
have
all
you
can
do
to
get
dressed
in
time
to
get
back
here
before
dark
you
re
so
everlasting
slow
and
sure
as
the
molasses
said
to
the
quicksilver
all
right
you
telephone
the
rawlinses
and
if
they
can
t
come
what
then
shall
we
ask
any
one
else
might
ask
maisie
may
but
we
don
t
want
a
lot
it
ll
seem
too
much
like
a
party
and
besides
there
won
t
be
enough
cakes
to
go
all
right
if
the
rawlinses
can
t
come
you
call
up
maisie
and
if
she
can
t
we
ll
flock
by
ourselves
maybe
mother
ll
want
me
to
go
out
with
her
somewhere
anyway
you
never
can
oh
don
t
do
that
if
you
do
i
ll
get
the
girls
to
come
just
to
see
me
and
it
would
be
horrid
not
to
be
together
this
first
well
i
spect
i
can
come
back
say
dot
we
ought
to
have
a
telephone
connection
wish
we
could
but
you
know
when
we
spoke
of
it
dad
said
we
couldn
t
have
everything
all
at
once
let
s
strike
for
it
for
all
right
but
i
s
pose
we
can
just
as
well
run
over
home
to
telephone
now
you
take
your
folkses
basket
and
i
ll
take
our
trays
got
your
key
yes
have
you
i
ll
lock
the
door
you
go
on
and
both
girls
ran
away
home
fayre
had
intended
to
have
dolly
go
on
an
errand
with
her
but
hearing
of
the
projected
plan
she
let
the
child
off
go
over
to
treasure
house
dear
if
you
like
she
said
but
some
days
i
must
claim
you
as
my
own
little
girl
i
don
t
want
to
lose
you
no
mumsie
said
dolly
her
arms
around
her
mother
s
neck
but
saturdays
you
know
t
i
always
have
saturdays
for
the
house
i
shouldn
t
wonder
now
go
and
dress
and
be
home
by
dinner
time
trudy
expects
yes
m
and
dolly
scampered
away
to
dress
she
heard
the
telephone
and
went
to
answer
thinking
it
might
be
dotty
and
it
was
the
rawlins
girls
are
coming
dotty
said
and
maisie
happened
to
be
at
their
house
so
i
had
to
ask
her
too
there
ll
be
cakes
enough
if
we
go
light
all
right
i
ll
be
over
pretty
soon
dolly
made
a
leisurely
toilette
as
she
always
did
she
rarely
moved
quickly
but
on
the
other
hand
she
was
not
often
late
she
put
on
a
pretty
little
voile
frock
of
bluet
blue
with
white
pipings
a
big
white
ribbon
bow
tied
her
hair
back
and
then
it
fell
in
a
long
braid
with
curly
ends
she
threw
a
big
cloak
round
her
one
of
trudy
s
discarded
and
ran
across
to
treasure
house
of
course
dotty
was
already
there
she
had
on
a
dress
of
bright
scotch
plaid
which
suited
her
type
scarlet
ribbons
on
her
hair
and
a
necklace
of
bright
red
beads
made
her
look
quite
festive
what
a
jolly
cloak
trude
s
it
was
but
she
gave
it
to
me
just
the
thing
to
wear
to
run
over
here
it
s
warm
but
it
s
it
s
dandy
you
mean
wish
i
had
one
i
guess
i
can
bamboozle
mother
or
auntie
into
making
me
one
you
look
awfully
nice
this
afternoon
why
didn
t
you
wear
your
blue
beads
they
don
t
quite
match
this
frock
they
re
too
greenishly
blue
why
did
you
wear
those
red
ones
cause
they
match
this
no
they
don
t
they
re
crimson
and
the
red
in
the
plaid
is
oh
what
a
fuss
well
then
i
wore
em
cause
they
re
pretty
and
becoming
and
i
like
em
there
now
all
right
glad
you
do
here
come
the
further
discussion
of
tints
and
shades
was
cut
short
by
the
entrance
of
grace
and
ethel
rawlins
and
maisie
may
well
if
this
isn
t
the
greatest
place
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
before
where
did
you
get
the
idea
oh
it
s
just
heavenly
such
lovely
furniture
and
things
and
there
s
another
room
why
a
i
did
exclamations
drowned
each
other
the
visitors
went
in
each
of
the
three
rooms
and
each
called
forth
new
praises
it
was
indeed
a
novelty
and
appealed
to
the
girls
hearts
as
a
most
desirable
and
cosy
place
to
read
or
study
but
you
study
here
asked
maisie
i
should
think
you
d
be
all
the
time
thinking
what
to
do
next
to
fix
it
up
and
you
couldn
t
put
your
mind
on
your
it
may
be
that
way
laughed
dolly
we
haven
t
really
tried
it
yet
you
see
we
only
moved
in
this
morning
not
everything
is
to
rights
yet
we
don
t
mind
you
girls
seeing
it
before
it
s
all
done
but
i
want
it
in
order
before
we
have
the
hallowe
en
come
on
said
dotty
let
s
gather
round
the
study
fire
and
talk
over
the
party
hallowe
en
isn
t
so
very
far
the
girls
drew
up
chairs
for
some
and
cushions
from
the
for
some
and
grouped
themselves
comfortably
before
the
fire
dolly
put
on
a
log
from
time
to
time
for
she
was
one
of
those
rare
creatures
who
are
born
with
a
sense
of
as
others
are
born
with
a
sense
of
colour
or
rhythm
she
always
knew
just
where
to
poke
the
dying
logs
and
where
to
lay
the
fresh
ones
dotty
had
promised
not
to
touch
it
for
she
had
a
fatal
propensity
for
putting
the
fire
out
or
at
least
causing
it
to
die
down
oh
it
s
ideal
exclaimed
grace
i
do
envy
you
girls
this
place
i
wish
we
could
have
one
but
father
wouldn
t
hear
of
it
he
d
think
it
cost
too
it
didn
t
cost
such
an
awful
lot
my
father
says
said
dolly
but
you
know
it
isn
t
always
cost
that
counts
lots
of
things
are
unusual
and
that
makes
people
think
they
are
impossible
your
father
could
afford
one
grace
if
he
wanted
to
you
see
it
could
be
built
much
cheaper
than
this
one
you
needn
t
really
have
but
one
room
and
goodness
what
s
that
for
a
regular
hullabaloo
was
heard
outside
knocking
at
the
door
tapping
at
the
windows
even
pounding
on
the
house
itself
dotty
looked
out
it
s
the
boys
she
said
and
her
voice
was
as
of
one
who
announces
a
dire
calamity
oh
fiddlesticks
exclaimed
dolly
what
shall
we
do
i
didn
t
want
them
this
tell
em
they
can
t
come
in
said
maisie
it
isn
t
yes
agreed
grace
just
open
the
door
and
tell
them
they
must
wait
till
next
week
i
ll
tell
them
if
you
want
me
to
my
brother
clayton
is
there
and
i
ll
make
him
take
the
others
i
ll
go
to
the
door
said
dotty
i
can
make
them
go
away
if
doll
goes
she
ll
be
so
she
ll
let
them
in
and
we
haven
t
that
is
don
t
want
them
the
noise
continued
and
the
boys
were
now
peeping
in
at
the
windows
and
making
signs
of
impatience
dotty
and
grace
opened
the
door
intending
to
persuade
the
visitors
to
depart
in
peace
but
the
boys
entered
in
a
sort
of
flying
wedge
it
would
have
taken
far
more
than
two
girls
to
keep
them
out
they
were
by
no
means
rude
or
boisterous
but
they
were
so
determined
to
come
in
they
just
came
whew
shouted
lollie
henry
if
this
isn
t
a
peach
of
a
place
how
do
you
do
dolly
and
dotty
i
suppose
you
re
hostesses
yes
we
come
in
thank
you
and
all
the
other
boys
there
were
half
a
dozen
of
them
the
acclamation
looky
here
at
the
well
maybe
we
aren
t
swell
see
the
dinky
little
what
do
you
cook
girls
oh
no
thank
you
we
stay
to
supper
oh
no
we
can
t
sorry
still
of
course
if
you
the
two
d
s
gave
in
the
boys
were
so
honestly
interested
and
admiring
and
they
wanted
to
see
everything
so
much
that
the
hostesses
couldn
t
bear
to
turn
them
out
and
indeed
they
couldn
t
turn
them
out
if
they
had
tried
so
they
let
them
stay
ungrudgingly
and
after
viewing
the
whole
domain
the
entire
company
surrounded
the
study
fire
once
more
the
boys
mostly
sat
on
the
floor
but
that
made
it
all
the
merrier
i
ll
tell
you
the
honest
truth
said
dolly
a
little
later
we
ve
got
enough
cakes
and
fruit
for
one
piece
all
round
if
that
will
satisfy
you
all
ample
declared
tod
brown
i
eat
more
than
one
piece
of
fruit
a
small
quarter
of
an
apple
or
a
section
of
an
orange
is
a
great
sufficiency
for
my
delicate
the
others
rejoined
with
similar
nonsense
and
the
scant
refreshments
were
brought
out
and
divided
fairly
amid
much
laughter
and
generous
attempts
at
self
denial
and
so
the
opening
day
at
treasure
house
passed
off
in
great
glee
and
merriment
and
every
guest
was
well
pleased
with
the
entertainment
chapter
vii
funny
uncle
jim
through
the
ensuing
week
the
girls
used
treasure
house
for
study
hours
and
too
they
finished
up
much
in
the
way
of
furnishing
they
were
not
both
there
every
day
and
sometimes
neither
was
there
but
the
house
was
a
great
comfort
and
soon
they
felt
greatly
at
home
in
it
it
s
getting
fitted
to
us
like
a
shoe
declared
dotty
after
a
few
days
at
first
i
didn
t
like
the
feel
of
this
chair
now
i
love
isn
t
it
funny
how
you
get
used
to
things
said
dolly
musingly
but
you
can
t
always
i
m
trying
to
get
used
to
bernice
forbes
and
yet
somehow
i
can
t
like
her
and
i
don
t
know
of
course
you
can
t
dolly
she
isn
t
our
and
dotty
shook
her
head
as
if
she
had
settled
the
question
for
all
time
oh
pshaw
our
sort
what
is
our
sort
i
d
like
to
know
she
s
just
as
good
as
we
are
just
as
rich
just
as
oh
i
don
t
mean
those
things
she
s
richer
than
any
of
our
set
and
fashionabler
too
but
that
doesn
t
make
her
our
well
what
does
if
you
know
so
she
s
too
for
one
thing
but
that
isn
t
the
main
thing
she
s
i
don
t
know
how
to
express
it
but
she
hasn
t
any
gumption
or
any
any
sense
but
she
she
has
and
it
s
that
makes
her
so
i
don
t
think
you
re
altogether
right
but
i
m
going
to
find
out
i
don
t
see
why
nobody
likes
but
you
ought
to
see
that
if
nobody
does
like
her
it
s
because
she
isn
t
likable
for
some
reason
or
i
do
see
that
and
i
m
going
to
find
out
that
some
reason
or
pitch
in
and
find
out
then
good
luck
to
you
oh
here
comes
thought
i
d
find
you
here
said
grace
rawlins
as
dotty
opened
the
door
to
her
hello
dolly
busy
studying
just
about
to
begin
to
think
about
getting
at
it
returned
dolly
laughing
but
it
can
wait
sit
down

t
stay
a
minute
i
just
flew
in
to
ask
you

dotty
and

t

our
grace
went
away
declaring
she
wouldn
t
longer
interfere
with
their
study
and
the
two
d
s
set
to
work
in
earnest
then
we
can
t
have
lunch
over
here
dotty
said
a
bit
regretfully
no
matter
there
are
lots
of
other
saturdays
i
d
rather
go
nutting
while
we
so
would
i
now
keep
still
i
ve
got
to
attack
these
geometry
thank
goodness
i
ve
done
mine
but
history
still
stares
me
in
the
silence
settled
down
upon
them
broken
occasionally
by
a
murmur
of
this
sort
ptolemy
i
was
followed
by
a
series
of
a
series
of
are
you
going
to
wear
dotsie
that
old
brown
cube
root
of
dolly
burst
into
laughter
x
square
plus
seven
x
plus
equals
eleven
thirds
she
quoted
dotty
laughed
back
and
quoted
their
favourite
hunting
of
the
taking
three
as
the
number
to
reason
a
convenient
number
to
we
add
seven
and
ten
and
then
multiply
out
by
one
thousand
diminished
by
eight
the
result
we
proceed
to
divide
as
you
see
by
nine
hundred
and
ninety
and
two
then
subtract
seventeen
and
the
answer
must
must
be
what
dolly
exactly
and
perfectly
true
said
dolly
who
was
only
half
listening
but
who
knew
her
lewis
carroll
by
heart
her
eyes
were
turned
up
to
the
ceiling
and
she
was
gabbling
over
and
by
a
series
of
monarchs
also
called
ptolemies
down
to
the
time
of
queen
cleopatra
the
last
of
the
line
by
a
series
of
series
of
ptolemies
also
called
monarchs
called
also
what
the
old
things
called
you
re
nutty
said
dotty
no
my
child
that
isn
t
slang
i
mean
you
re
thinking
of
the
nutting
party
and
you
can
t
get
the
series
of
mummies
straight
in
your
they
weren
t
they
were
after
they
stopped
being
monarchs
weren
t
they
all
egyptians
were
mean
all
fashionable
egyptians
do
keep
still
dear
sweet
dollyrinda
keep
still
the
cube
root
of
xy
do
abhor
detest
despise
abominate
these
cubed
xy
s
but
having
thus
exploded
her
wrath
dotty
set
to
work
in
earnest
and
finally
conquered
the
refractory
factors
done
she
announced
at
the
end
of
a
half
hour
of
hard
work
i
ve
cubed
everything
in
sight
and
some
roots
that
were
hidden
deeply
and
darkly
in
the
you
ought
to
be
a
cubist
that
we
read
so
much
about
in
the
no
thank
you
i
ll
cube
what
i
have
to
but
i
ll
never
go
out
cubing
for
pleasure
how
are
your
ptolemies
awfully
mixed
up
i
m
going
to
let
them
simmer
over
night
and
get
up
early
and
attack
them
with
the
dew
on
them
perhaps
i
can
lash
em
to
the
mast
the
next
day
turned
out
to
be
an
ideal
piece
of
weather
clear
cold
the
wind
tossing
white
drifts
of
cloud
about
in
the
upper
blue
and
descending
to
whisk
the
nuts
off
the
trees
for
those
who
desired
them
the
wind
was
aided
and
abetted
by
uncle
jim
s
men
and
when
the
crowd
of
girls
arrived
there
was
a
widespread
area
of
ground
awaiting
them
well
this
is
some
sort
of
a
nutting
party
said
dolly
as
each
with
a
basket
they
started
to
the
fray
all
i
ve
been
on
lately
meant
hunting
around
half
an
hour
for
three
small
nuts
oh
dolly
what
a
sad
experience
grace
returned
i
m
so
glad
i
brought
you
up
here
to
brazil
where
the
nuts
come
it
s
sure
some
little
old
brazil
all
right
agreed
dotty
and
then
they
all
stooped
to
their
task
baskets
were
quickly
filled
and
the
girls
sat
down
to
rest
under
a
tree
this
must
be
the
old
original
spreading
chestnut
tree
said
maisie
i
always
wondered
if
it
did
really
spread
such
a
lot
i
see
it
here
comes
the
spread
said
grace
as
a
maid
appeared
bearing
a
tray
filled
with
glasses
and
plates
the
contents
were
sweet
cider
and
ginger
cakes
and
to
the
hungry
girls
they
looked
very
good
indeed
but
we
must
be
getting

ethel

kitchen
door
not
quite
so
sure
of
sary
s
warm
welcome
as
their
host
was
but
they
found
he
was
right
well
for
the
land
s
sake
what
a
delegation
come
in
miss
grace
and
miss
ethel
and
bring
your
friends
excuse
my
untidiness
i
wasn
t
expecting
the
apology
was
wholly
unnecessary
for
everything
in
sary
s
kitchen
was
spick
and
span
and
shining
she
was
a
buxom
woman
of
middle
age
and
had
a
broad
smiling
face
overflowing
with
good
nature
her
daughter
etty
was
the
one
who
brought
them
their
cakes
and
cider
and
she
was
shy
but
exceedingly
curious
to
see
the
city
ladies
the
girls
seemed
to
her
she
conducted
them
all
over
the
fine
old
farmhouse
and
listened
in
surprise
as
they
exclaimed
in
wonder
and
delight
over
the
big
open
fireplaces
and
old
mahogany
furniture
that
seemed
to
her
the
most
uninteresting
and
commonplace
affairs
perfectly
gorgeous
cried
dotty
oh
grace
i
d
ever
so
much
rather
have
the
hallowe
en
party
here
wouldn
t
you
old
dollypops
yes
of
course
and
we
can
just
as
well
have
any
other
sort
of
a
party
at
treasure
course
we
can
and
we
will
after
this
affair
is
over
i
say
girls
let
s
have
it
a
masquerade
oh
let
s
said
maisie
i
ve
a
dress
all
ready
to
wear
it
s
a
witch
dress
i
think
we
ought
all
to
dress
as
witches
interrupted
grace
or
spooks
or
hobgoblins
that
s
all
right
put
in
dotty
but
the
boys
won
t
do
it
they
hate
dressing
let
em
stay
away
no
a
hallowe
en
party
without
boys
is
no
fun
they
make
up
the
tricks
and
jokes
you
that
s
so
said
dolly
but
if
you
tell
the
boys
they
can
t
come
unless
they
wear
spooky
rigs
they
ll
do
it
fast
enough
why
a
sheet
and
pillowcase
is
good
enough
and
that
s
no
trouble
at
all
don
t
you
know
dot
we
wore
them
up
at
crosstrees
last
summer
and
the
boys
didn
t
mind
a
yep
that
s
so
oh
the
boys
will
come
you
couldn
t
keep
them
away
what
a
fireplace
to
roast
chestnuts
or
pop
corn
they
were
in
the
now
and
its
enormous
stone
fireplace
was
indeed
ideal
for
a
hallowe
en
frolic
and
the
kitchen
too
offered
enchanting
possibilities
then
there
was
the
orchard
if
any
one
dared
try
fortunes
beneath
the
stars
altogether
it
was
a
splendid
chance
and
the
two
d
s
were
glad
to
lay
aside
their
own
half
formed
plans
for
these
on
the
way
home
they
talked
it
over
and
as
they
drew
near
the
roses
house
the
d
s
asked
the
other
girls
to
come
in
and
talk
some
more
i
can
t
said
grace
i
promised
mother
ethel
and
i
would
get
home
early
it
s
a
little
after
five
then
you
come
in
maisie
said
dolly
we
ll
make
fudge
you
can
stay
till
six
can
t
you
yes
indeed
and
i
m
simply
starving
for
chapter
viii
a
strange
intruder
i
think
this
is
the
dearest
place
said
maisie
as
they
went
in
the
door
of
treasure
house
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
before
whose
plan
was
it
our
two
fatherses
mostly
replied
dotty
wait
a
minute
girls
till
i
switch
on
the
in
a
moment
a
small
side
light
pierced
the
gloom
but
before
she
could
turn
on
the
larger
light
dotty
gave
a
scream
oh
she
fairly
shrieked
what
is
that
who
is
it
who
is
what
cried
dolly
following
her
in
and
maisie
came
quickly
after
then
they
saw
what
she
meant
somebody
or
something
lay
on
the
floor
something
like
a
person
but
still
and
unmoving
it
s
a
woman
screamed
dotty
as
she
peered
down
into
a
veiled
white
face
oh
who
can
it
be
how
did
she
get
here
always
excitable
dotty
was
now
fairly
beside
herself
with
fear
and
alarm
and
not
daring
to
touch
the
prostrate
figure
she
shuddered
and
fell
back
against
the
wall
can
t
look
what
is
it
and
dolly
clapped
her
hands
over
her
eyes
and
refused
to
take
them
down
see
what
it
is
maisie
won
t
you
no
i
don
t
see
why
when
you
and
won
t
and
maisie
cowered
in
another
corner
dolly
peeped
out
from
between
her
fingers
maisie
had
fallen
in
a
heap
on
a
and
was
shaking
with
nervous
fear
dotty
was
staring
at
the
woman
on
the
floor
but
was
now
showing
more
curiosity
than
terror
dolly
glanced
at
the
still
form
lying
there
is
she
she
faltered
ridiculous
cried
dotty
of
course
not
just
stepped
in
here
oh
and
dolly
became
hysterical
that
s
like
a
story
father
tells
the
man
who
called
at
a
house
and
said
let
me
have
a
in
your
hall
if
he
stuttered
as
much
as
you
do
i
guess
he
had
a
chill
instead
of
a
fit
giggled
dotty
and
then
maisie
roused
herself
let
s
lift
her
up
she
said
i
m
not
afraid
come
and
help
she
took
a
few
steps
nearer
the
woman
and
then
catching
another
look
at
the
face
she
cried
oh
i
can
t
she
looks
so
queer
queer
how
and
dotty
s
curiosity
overcame
her
repugnance
and
she
drew
near
to
look
in
the
face
if
i
dared
lift
her
she
bent
over
and
drew
back
instantly
oh
girls
her
face
is
cold
stone
cold
then
she
s
dead
wailed
dotty
i
told
you
so
dead
in
our
pretty
house
well
if
the
poor
lady
is
dead
she
can
t
harm
us
let
s
lift
her
up
and
maisie
with
returning
courage
put
her
hand
under
the
mop
of
grey
hair
which
was
partly
hidden
beneath
a
dark
felt
hat
but
again
the
strange
eerie
sensation
of
touching
an
inert
form
overcame
her
and
pulling
her
hand
away
she
ran
back
to
the
i
can
t
i
thought
i
could
but
i
can
t
oh
what
shall
we
do
i
s
pose

have
to
go
and
get
somebody

dotty
i
won
t
let
you

and
get
somebody
and
dolly
and
i
will

maisie
started
but
on
opening
the
door
and
peering
out
she
flew
back
slamming
the
door
hard
what
is
it
cried
both
girls
what
did
you
see
oh
oh
and
maisie
shivered
and
shook
tell
us
what

out

there
oh
but
it
s
so
dark
i
m
afraid

be
more
of
more
people
wanting
to
have
a
fit
in
our
hall
said
dotty
who
never
could
fail
to
see
the
ridiculous
side
of
anything

t
dot
implored
dolly
talk
like
that
maybe
she
is

why
of

t
if
she

dead
can
she
well
wait
a
minute
you
always
fly
off
so
quick
dotty
let
me
think
let
s
all
sit
down
here
and
think
a
dolly
pulled
the
two
girls
down
beside
her
on
a
they
looked
at
the
silent
motionless
form
the
woman
lay
on
her
side
her
hands
under
her
her
feet
in
old
buttoned
shoes
stuck
out
beneath
a
shabby
skirt
of
dark
cloth
frayed
at
the
edges
she
wore
a
big
dark
coat
of
rough
cloth
her
hat
was
held
on
by
a
thick
veil
through
which
they
could
quite
plainly
see
her
face
she
had
a
very
white
complexion
but
very
red
cheeks
and
staring
blue
eyes
her
grey
hair
was
frowsy
and
half
tumbling
down
and
round
her
neck
was
an
old
black
feather
boa
altogether
she
looked
poorly
dressed
but
her
face
gave
promise
of
being
pretty
i
ve
got
to
see
her
better
declared
dotty
as
dolly
s
cogitation
had
promised
no
suggestions
i
ve
just
simply
to
maisie
will
you
help
lift
her
head
if
i
ll
help
yes
i
will
said
maisie
decidedly
i
won
t
flinch
this
dotty
went
over
and
knelt
at
the
woman
s
side
maisie
knelt
at
her
head
now
said
dotty
i
ll
put
my
hands
under
her
shoulders
and
you
put
yours
beneath
her
head
and
we
ll
sit
her
up
she
isn
gently
dotty
put
her
hand
under
the
old
cloth
coat
carefully
maisie
passed
her
hand
again
under
the
grey
hair
now
said
dotty
and
as
they
lifted
the
grey
hair
came
off
in
maisie
s
hand
head
of
the
woman
rolled
away
from
the
body
all
three
girls
shrieked
and
then
dotty
began
to
scream
with
laughter
oh
she
cried
oh
that
naughty
little
thing
oh
how
could
she
girls
girls
it
isn
t
a
woman
it
s
a
dummy
thing
that
horrid
little
genie
fixed
up
to
tease
us
she
ought
to
be
punished
for
this
but
we
well
taken
in
the
other
two
began
to
realise
at
last
what
dotty
meant
sure
enough
the
grey
hair
was
a
wig
or
rather
what
is
known
as
a
the
head
was
a
plaster
cast
nearly
life
size
and
the
body
of
the
supposed
woman
was
a
small
bolster
dressed
in
old
clothes
the
shoes
were
merely
tucked
under
the
edge
of
the
skirt
dotty
lifted
up
the
head
and
pulled
off
the
veil
it
s
my
old
cast
of
the
head
of
the
milo
venus
she
said
see
that
little
scamp
has
painted
the
cheeks
and
lips
red
and
the
eyes
blue
and
left
the
rest
white
no
wonder
she
looked
pale
and
with
that
veil
on
it
sure
did
look
like
a
person
said
maisie
well
she
had
the
joke
on
us
all
right
i
was
scared
out
of
my
wits
so
was
i
whispered
dolly
who
was
still
shaking
and
i
can
t
get
over
it
it
was
awful
oh
pooh
said
dotty
i
was
scared
too
but
i
fully
expect
to
get
over
it
i
think
we
all
will
don
t
worry
doll
a
pan
of
fudge
will
calm
your
oh
it
s
too
late
to
make
fudge
i
want
to
go
stay
right
where
you
are
sister
a
few
more
bright
lights
and
a
will
make
a
new
dolly
of
as
she
talked
dotty
was
switching
on
lights
all
over
the
house
getting
out
chocolate
and
the
and
making
signs
to
maisie
to
perk
up
and
be
gay
maisie
took
the
hint
and
in
a
short
time
there
was
excellent
fudge
ready
for
three
merrily
laughing
girls
dotty
felt
the
responsibility
of
the
thing
for
it
was
her
sister
who
was
the
culprit
she
recognised
the
cast
and
also
the
clothing
and
the
wig
and
she
knew
it
could
have
been
no
one
else
but
the
mischievous
genie
so
she
did
all
she
could
to
remove
the
shadow
of
unpleasantness
that
hung
round
the
performance
and
she
succeeded
admirably
naturally
the
talk
turned
to
the
hallowe
en
party
i
suppose
grace
and
ethel
will
make
out
the
list
of
invitations
said
dotty
it
won
t
take
much
making
out
was
maisie
s
idea
they
ll
just
ask
our
crowd
and
that
will
be
about
enough
us
five
who
were
there
and
celia
and
six
boys
will
be
twelve
that
s
i
wish
she
d
ask
bernice
forbes
said
dolly
doubtfully
but
i
s
pose
she
won
i
s
pose
she
won
t
too
said
dot
pooh
who
wants
bernice
forbes
i
don
t
for
one
asserted
maisie
i
can
t
bear
the
i
don
t
see
why
argued
dolly
she
would
be
all
right
if
people
would
be
nice
to
all
right
she
be
all
right
and
dotty
shook
her
head
she
don
t
know
to
be
all
that
s
so
and
maisie
laughed
well
i
must
go
home
girls
i
ve
had
a
lovely
fudge
party
and
i
think
genie
s
joke
was
a
great
success
tell
her
so
for
me
all
right
i
will
and
with
laughing
maisie
went
home
and
the
two
d
s
stayed
to
put
things
straight
it
was
their
rule
never
to
leave
treasure
house
untidy
over
night
dotty
whistled
and
dolly
sang
as
they
flew
around
and
soon
had
things
now
dot
said
dolly
as
they
poked
out
the
dying
embers
of
the
fire
i
want
to
tell
you
something
i
m
going
to
ask
grace
to
ask
bernice
to
that
no
you
re
not
dollyrinda
you
think
so
now
but
you
go
home
and
think
it
over
and
you
ll
see
that
you
ll
spoil
the
whole
party
if
you
you
mean
spoil
it
for
it
won
t
for
anybody
else
not
everybody
is
as
mean
as
you
are
to
that
girl
nobody
likes
her
you
ve
often
said
so
all
the
more
reason
then
to
have
her
there
and
let
them
learn
to
like
oh
good
gracious
you
make
me
tired
why
are
you
so
everlastingly
gone
on
her
just
because
she
s
rich
dotty
rose
you
take
that
back
that
s
a
mean
thing
to
say
and
you
it
isn
t
true
you
well
i
never
knew
you
to
care
for
anybody
for
that
reason
before
but
i
can
t
think
of
any
well
that
the
reason
and
you
know
it
perfectly
well
now
i
ll
tell
you
what
the
reason
is
if
you
can
understand
it
and
i
don
t
know
as
you
can
it
s
because
i
m
sorry
for
her
everybody
snubs
her
and
she
d
just
love
to
be
liked
and
sought
oh
she
would
she
then
why
doesn
t
she
make
herself
liked
and
sought
after
how
can
she
if
we
don
t
give
her
a
chance
let
her
make
her
own
but
she
can
t
dotty
if
no
one
invites
her
anywhere
how
can
she
make
herself
agreeable
and
pleasant
to
them
let
her
give
a
party
herself
and
invite
i
ve
no
doubt
she
d
be
glad
to
if
she
thought
we
d
go
to
it
but
if
we
snub
her
right
and
left
she
won
t
dare
ask
well
let
her
be
more
pleasant
at
school
then
she
s
and
proudy
and
she
thinks
she
s
the
whole
world
oh
let
up
dolly
what
do
you
want
to
bother
with
her
for
there
are
enough
in
our
crowd
already
and
we
just
plain
don
t
want
dot
you
re
horrid
can
t
you
feel
sorry
for
her
put
yourself
in
her
place
how
would
you
feel
if
everybody
turned
the
cold
shoulder
to
you
i
d
be
so
gay
and
merry
they
d
to
like
oh
that
s
all
very
well
because
everybody
like
you
but
if
they
snubbed
you
what
then
why
dollops
if
i
deserved
it
i
d
have
to
grin
and
bear
it
i
spect
but
facts
is
facts
you
can
t
make
bernie
forbes
over
and
unless
you
can
you
can
t
make
people
like
her
and
that
s
all
there
is
about
it
and
another
thing
doll
i
know
and
you
know
your
high
and
noble
aim
in
this
matter
but
the
others
don
t
and
wouldn
t
believe
it
if
they
did
you
go
on
like
this
and
people
will
soon
be
saying
that
you
re
toadying
to
bernice
forbes
just
because
she
s
the
richest
girl
in
town
and
you
ll
see
what
they
ll
think
of
that
pooh
i
don
t
care
if
they
do
bernice
hasn
t
any
mother
and
her
father
is
a
stern
grumpy
old
thing
and
i
sorry
for
her
and
i
going
to
do
anything
i
can
to
help
her
have
a
good
time
and
i
going
to
coax
grace
rawlins
to
ask
her
to
the
hallowe
en
party
so
there
now
miss
dorothy
rose
you
can
put
that
in
your
pipe
and
smoke
it
when
dolly
was
in
earnest
she
was
very
much
so
and
dotty
well
knew
there
was
no
use
combating
her
in
this
mood
so
she
changed
her
tactics
and
said
laughingly
well
don
t
let
quarrel
about
it
anyway
and
it
s
time
to
go
home
now
come
no
i
won
t
come
on
till
you
say
you
ll
help
me
in
my
plan
if
you
and
i
both
ask
grace
to
ask
bernie
she
ll
do
it
but
if
i
ask
her
and
then
you
go
to
her
and
ask
her
to
she
do
it
and
i
know
that
s
what
you
ll
do
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
was
exactly
what
dotty
intended
to
do
in
fact
she
had
already
planned
in
her
mind
to
telephone
the
moment
she
got
home
to
grace
and
ask
her
to
consent
to
dolly
s
request
it
wasn
t
that
dotty
had
such
rooted
objections
to
bernice
but
she
unattractive
and
stiff
and
moreover
exceedingly
critical
and
too
dotty
didn
t
care
so
especially
about
the
party
but
she
didn
t
want
bernice
included
in
the
six
girls
who
made
up
their
crowd
and
if
dolly
took
her
up
so
desperately
first
thing
they
knew
she
would
be
in
the
crowd
and
she
would
be
all
the
time
coming
to
treasure
house
was
the
rub
feared
way
down
deep
in
her
inmost
heart
that
bernice
might
cut
her
out
with
dolly
and
that
would
be
the
crowning
tragedy
it
was
scarcely
possible
of
course
but
dolly
took
strange
notions
sometimes
and
dotty
was
taking
no
chances
on
such
a
catastrophe
all
right
i
ll
promise
not
to
say
anything
to
grace
at
all
about
it
but
i
won
t
promise
to
coax
her
to
ask
bernice
for
i
don
t
want
her
to
aw
dollyrinda
let
up
on
that
crazy
scheme
it
s
only
a
whim
and
don
t
you
see
if
you
get
her
asked
there
and
she
have
a
good
time
she
ll
wish
she
hadn
t
come
after
all
and
so
you
ll
be
giving
her
a
disappointment
instead
of
a
but
she
would
have
a
good
time
i
d
see
that
she
you
would
and
how
why
you
d
ask
the
boys
to
be
nice
to
her
and
dance
with
her
and
everything
they
do
it
they
would
they
do
it
when
you
asked
them
at
the
high
school
dance
they
did
how
do
you
know
lollie
told
me
he
said
it
was
ducky
of
you
to
try
to
be
so
nice
to
her
but
it
wouldn
t
go
down
the
boys
just
simply
plain
won
t
you
know
isn
t
it
mean
of
them
dot
don
t
you
think
it
is
oh
i
don
t
know
i
keep
telling
you
dolly
if
bernice
was
nice
to
people
you
wouldn
t
have
to
try
to
boost
her
and
if
she
isn
t
boosting
won
t
do
any
good

s
pose
we
must
well
dot
i
ll

t
mad
at
what
genie

you
oh
goodness

i
don
t
like

miss
partland
but
i
m
not

of
course
good
for
you
but
i
ll
see
that
she
isn
t
allowed
to
do
such
a
thing
chapter
ix
fairies
and
such
dolly
did
think
over
the
question
of
bernice
forbes
and
the
party
and
the
result
of
her
cogitation
led
her
straight
to
grace
s
house
i
ve
come
she
said
to
ask
a
favour
grace
i
want
to
know
if
you
won
t
ask
bernice
forbes
to
your
hallowe
en
why
dolly
i
would
you
see
the
number
is
all
made
what
number
the
number
i
planned
to
invite
twelve
it
but
couldn
t
you
add
two
more
bernice
and
another
boy
to
make
it
even
i
suppose
i
could
but
know
dolly
nobody
likes
bernice
she
oh
don
t
tell
me
what
she
is
i
know
it
but
grace
i
think
it
s
mean
the
way
we
girls
treat
her
now
never
mind
she
is
won
t
you
ask
her
just
for
my
sake
dolly
s
smile
was
very
winning
and
her
blue
eyes
very
pleading
and
grace
was
about
to
consent
when
ethel
came
in
they
told
her
the
subject
under
discussion
not
much
declared
ethel
if
that
thing
goes
don
t
all
right
dolly
blazed
back
if
she
go
don
t
probably
neither
girl
meant
what
she
said
but
having
said
it
they
both
stuck
to
it
so
spirited
the
argument
became
that
rawlins
overheard
the
angry
voices
and
came
into
the
room
what
the
matter
girlies
why
dolly
fayre
what
are
you
crying
about
i
m
not
crying
rawlins
and
dolly
brushed
a
tear
or
two
off
her
cheeks
i
m
afraid
i
i
guess
i
ll
go
home
not
till
you
tell
me
the
trouble
dear
and
rawlins
sat
down
beside
the
disturbed
guest
what
is
it
grace
it
s
my
fault
rawlins
dolly
spoke
up
i
was
trying
to
make
the
girls
do
something
they
don
t
want
to
and
i
had
no
business
to
do
dolly
was
always
just
even
against
herself
but
what
is
it
tell
me
why
mother
dolly
wants
to
ask
bernice
forbes
to
our
party
and
we
don
t
want
to
cause
she
d
spoil
the
whole
why
and
rawlins
smiled
is
bernice
such
a
spoilsport
as
all
that
yes
she
do
you
think
so
dolly
well
you
see
rawlins
she
awfully
nice
but
i
m
sorry
for
her
and
i
thought
if
we
invited
her
to
things
and
made
her
like
us
she
d
be
nicer
and
we
d
like
is
this
the
only
reason
dolly
and
rawlins
looked
quizzically
at
her
immediately
it
came
into
dolly
s
mind
how
dotty
had
said
everybody
would
attribute
dolly
s
interest
in
bernice
to
the
fact
that
she
was
the
daughter
of
the
richest
man
in
town
and
really
an
heiress
in
her
own
right
dolly
blushed
uncomfortably
but
she
looked
straight
at
her
questioner
and
replied
yes
rawlins
it
s
only
because
i
m
sorry
for
bernice
and
she
hesitated
and
then
added
honestly
and
a
because
everybody
is
so
down
on
her
and
i
don
t
think
it
s
fair
i
don
t
either
declared
the
lady
heartily
you
re
just
right
dolly
and
bernice
shall
be
but
ethel
says
she
won
t
go
then
began
grace
as
ethel
herself
spoke
up
oh
of
course
i
will
if
mother
says
we
must
ask
bernice
i
don
t
care
such
a
terrible
lot
anyway
and
i
m
sorry
i
was
snappy
to
you
i
m
sorry
i
was
snappy
too
and
dolly
s
pretty
face
showed
real
contrition
are
you
sure
you
won
t
mind
too
much
girls
of
course
they
won
t
rawlins
answered
for
them
she
was
a
pretty
smiling
little
lady
and
as
a
rule
everybody
who
was
with
her
liked
to
do
as
she
said
now
that
is
settled
bernice
shall
be
asked
mustn
t
we
then
ask
one
more
boy
yes
mother
and
let
s
ask
clayton
to
get
some
one
he
knows
a
lot
of
boys
and
he
ll
know
just
which
one
to
good
idea
gracie
is
your
dress
ready
dolly
what
are
you
going
to
wear
oh
i
can
t
tell
you
that
before
the
girls
you
know
it
s
a
oh
yes
so
it
is
well
set
your
mind
at
rest
dear
i
ll
ask
bernice
myself
and
i
ll
tell
her
about
the
masquerade
don
t
let
any
one
know
she
s
coming
and
then
they
ll
never
suspect
who
she
is
until
you
take
off
your
oh
what
a
lovely
idea
rawlins
and
dolly
s
eyes
shone
with
pleasure
don
t
tell
will
you
girls
no
said
grace
but
everybody
will
know
when
they
see
seven
girls
who
the
other
they
won
t
know
for
sure
and
anyway
the
boys
won
t
know
you
needn
t
even
tell
so
the
matter
was
settled
and
dolly
went
off
home
happy
at
having
gained
her
point
at
last
the
night
of
the
party
arrived
the
girls
had
planned
not
to
let
each
other
know
what
they
would
wear
and
see
if
they
could
guess
identities
dolly
and
dotty
had
no
idea
of
each
other
s
costume
and
even
grace
and
ethel
rawlins
were
in
equal
ignorance
of
theirs
the
girls
were
to
meet
at
the
rawlins
house
and
the
boys
at
the
browns
and
go
out
to
uncle
jim
s
separately
in
motor
cars
provided
by
the
several
families
rawlins
would
act
as
hostess
and
rawlins
was
a
general
manager
who
seemed
to
look
after
everything
at
once
at
the
hour
of
meeting
dolly
found
herself
to
be
the
first
one
to
arrive
she
had
come
from
home
by
a
roundabout
way
and
her
father
who
accompanied
her
to
the
corner
stepped
aside
and
let
her
go
up
the
steps
alone
so
that
no
one
might
suspect
it
was
she
dolly
was
attired
as
a
ghost
her
dress
was
lovely
being
made
of
many
layers
of
white
tarlatan
one
over
the
other
with
long
angel
sleeves
and
fluttering
draperies
that
wafted
about
as
she
walked
a
scarf
of
the
same
material
enveloped
her
head
and
neck
and
trailed
its
long
ends
behind
her
she
wore
white
silk
gloves
but
her
hands
were
hidden
in
the
swirl
of
the
misty
material
she
was
a
veritable
ghost
and
deep
in
the
shadows
of
her
swathing
headgear
her
face
was
concealed
by
a
little
white
satin
mask
of
course
her
hair
was
completely
hidden
and
she
moved
with
slow
sinuous
movements
waving
her
draped
arms
in
true
spectre
fashion
come
in
ghost
said
rawlins
as
dolly
stepped
into
the
reception
room
well
you
are
a
spirit
indeed
i
never
saw
a
real
live
ghost
before
dolly
swept
long
ghostly
curtseys
but
said
no
word
grace
rawlins
came
next
she
had
gone
out
and
around
several
blocks
so
that
she
might
enter
her
own
house
as
a
visitor
grace
was
a
fairy
her
dress
was
full
and
frilly
of
pale
pink
crêpe
paper
and
she
had
pink
and
gilt
wings
and
a
long
wand
her
hair
which
might
have
been
recognisable
was
hidden
in
a
dainty
pink
silk
cap
with
a
long
gilt
feather
and
a
full
ruche
of
frilled
paper
hid
her
neck
and
chin
a
pink
mask
covered
her
face
and
she
wore
long
pink
silk
gloves
dolly
stared
hard
at
her
but
could
not
be
sure
who
it
was
she
thought
the
fairy
looked
a
little
like
maisie
may
but
never
suspected
grace
maisie
came
next
though
nobody
knew
it
she
was
a
brownie
she
had
borrowed
a
suit
from
a
cousin
out
of
town
the
costume
had
been
made
for
a
city
party
and
was
an
exact
brownie
rig
of
course
it
completely
disguised
maisie
and
the
mask
was
weird
and
quite
appropriate
to
the
occasion
then
bernice
came
she
represented
an
elf
her
costume
was
made
entirely
of
overlapping
green
leaves
and
a
of
the
same
green
stockings
and
slippers
green
gloves
and
a
green
mask
made
her
entirely
unrecognisable
dolly
thought
it
was
dotty
as
the
two
were
much
the
same
height
bernice
moved
about
shyly
and
sank
into
the
first
chair
she
came
to
and
then
dolly
felt
sure
it
was
dotty
trying
to
disguise
her
own
brisk
manner
when
dotty
did
come
dolly
had
no
idea
who
it
was
her
costume
was
that
of
a
witch
long
red
cloak
and
high
peaked
cap
from
which
hung
straggling
grey
locks
a
red
and
black
gown
red
stockings
and
black
slippers
and
a
mask
like
that
of
a
little
old
lady
with
a
hooked
nose
and
she
carried
a
broom
gilded
and
tied
with
red
ribbons
it
was
a
most
picturesque
garb
and
dolly
decided
it
must
be
bernice
but
no
one
spoke
to
another
occasionally
one
would
nod
knowingly
as
if
to
say
she
recognised
some
one
or
point
a
finger
at
her
but
the
other
always
shook
her
head
vigorously
as
if
the
guess
were
wrong
it
was
imperative
that
each
should
represent
some
idea
connected
with
the
occasion
so
celia
ferris
came
as
autumn
she
wore
yellow
and
brown
with
touches
of
red
and
she
carried
a
basket
of
fruit
her
was
made
of
autumn
leaves
and
she
wore
long
necklaces
of
cranberries
strung
on
a
thread
last
to
arrive
was
ethel
rawlins
she
had
delayed
late
thinking
that
then
no
one
would
suspect
her
identity
she
was
the
nut
brown
maid
all
her
robe
was
of
brown
and
it
had
fringes
of
nuts
at
the
ends
of
bits
of
ribbon
her
was
trimmed
with
chestnut
burs
and
she
had
necklace
and
armlets
of
strung
nuts
now
the
girls
were
all
present
and
though
they
guessed
none
knew
positively
who
any
other
was
those
who
knew
bernice
s
invitation
had
not
told
and
those
who
did
not
know
it
wondered
greatly
who
the
seventh
girl
could
be
though
some
surmised
correctly
rawlins
laughingly
collected
her
charges
and
packed
them
into
two
big
motor
cars
and
they
set
off
for
uncle
jim
s
at
his
request
all
the
girls
called
him
by
that
familiar
title
as
the
cars
were
swift
ones
the
party
soon
reached
the
country
house
not
a
word
was
spoken
on
the
way
for
the
girls
found
they
were
well
disguised
and
they
determined
to
keep
up
the
mystery
but
there
was
much
giggling
and
many
expressive
exclamations
in
deep
guttural
tones
reaching
their
destination
a
wonderful
scene
awaited
them
uncle
jim
had
begged
rawlins
to
do
anything
she
could
to
make
the
house
attractive
and
appropriate
for
the
occasion
so
with
the
help
of
the
willing
servants
she
had
transformed
the
great
hall
and
the
big
old
parlour
into
a
veritable
hallowe
en
revel
branches
of
bright
autumn
leaves
decked
the
walls
red
and
yellow
cheesecloth
made
gay
draperies
and
streamers
of
red
and
yellow
crêpe
paper
fluttered
here
and
there
pumpkins
held
masses
of
little
late
chrysanthemums
and
sheaves
of
grain
stood
in
corners
there
were
too
made
of
yellow
or
of
green
pumpkins
and
also
of
squashes
whose
candles
within
lit
up
their
strange
grotesque
faces
the
boys
had
already
arrived
and
round
the
room
stood
seven
silent
figures
they
were
dressed
as
robin
hood
peter
pan
or
merely
as
spooks
and
goblins
apparently
the
boys
had
been
quite
willing
to
dress
up
and
their
costumes
were
as
picturesque
as
the
girls
uncle
jim
greeted
the
incoming
crowd
wal
wal
what
a
visitation
my
but
ye
re
a
lot
of
perty
spooks
look
at
this
white
ghost
now
as
dolly
swept
him
a
long
low
bow
ain
t
she
the
beauty
i
ain
t
afeard
of
ghostes
like
that
now
you
bet
i
ain
t
and
see
the
fairy
my
stars
ye
re
all
so
fine
i
dunno
which
way
to
look
first
then
the
boys
advanced
and
greeted
the
girls
with
bows
peering
closely
for
some
identifying
sign
and
getting
laughed
at
for
their
pains
now
here
s
yer
welcome
said
uncle
jim
this
is
a
writ
welcome
fer
the
reason
that
i
ain
t
much
on
expressin
my
thoughts
but
i
m
right
down
glad
to
see
ye
all
then
each
received
a
pretty
printed
card
decorated
with
designs
of
black
cats
and
owls
and
witches
on
broomsticks
it
read
spooks
and
spirits
we
invite
to
our
party
witches
night
and
the
black
cat
yowls
and
howls
and
growls
and
the
gray
owl
hoots
and
and
the
moon
is
yellow
and
big
and
round
as
the
pumpkins
lying
on
the
ground
so
join
our
ranks
and
come
along
to
uncle
jim
s
where
the
witches
throng
this
was
read
with
nods
of
delight
and
the
cards
laid
away
to
take
home
as
souvenirs
robin
hood
stood
near
dolly
as
she
finished
reading
hers
and
he
politely
offered
her
a
pencil
to
write
her
name
on
it
for
then
he
eagerly
leaned
over
to
see
what
name
she
wrote
groaned
dolly
in
sepulchral
tones
and
then
she
wrote
on
her
card
but
she
printed
it
in
straggling
letters
for
she
was
too
canny
to
show
her
own
penmanship
many
were
the
traps
laid
to
learn
who
was
who
but
the
secrets
were
for
the
most
part
well
kept
lollie
henry
was
discovered
by
his
familiar
laugh
and
his
inability
to
suppress
it
maisie
may
was
known
when
a
lock
of
her
auburn
hair
escaped
from
the
queer
brownie
then
of
course
these
two
being
known
they
tried
to
make
the
others
speak
tell
me
who
you
are
lollie
wheedled
of
the
elf
bernice
the
only
answer
was
a
vigorous
shake
of
the
head
ah
you
needn
t
tell
i
know
he
exclaimed
triumphantly
you
re
dotty
rose
i
know
by
the
toss
of
your
head
aren
t
you
now
the
elf
nodded
yes
with
such
insistence
that
lollie
felt
sure
his
guess
was
wrong
dotty
as
a
witch
was
in
her
element
she
darted
about
tweaking
people
s
ears
or
tapping
their
arms
with
her
broomstick
she
had
a
funny
little
cackling
laugh
that
was
so
unlike
her
own
voice
it
was
not
recognised
though
dolly
soon
suspected
her
she
hovered
about
uncle
jim
teasing
him
until
the
old
man
shook
with
laughter
my
what
a
witch
it
is
he
exclaimed
right
from
old
salem
town
i
ll
be
bound
they
played
all
the
regulation
hallowe
en
games
thread
the
needle
blow
the
candle
and
all
the
ones
then
rawlins
brought
in
a
plate
which
she
set
on
the
table
this
said
she
is
a
test
to
see
who
of
you
will
be
married
this
year
now
who
will
try
first
the
girls
hung
back
and
the
boys
urged
them
forward
at
last
the
fairy
flitted
up
to
make
the
first
test
on
the
plate
was
a
mound
of
flour
tightly
pressed
into
shape
rawlins
explained
the
test
you
see
she
said
the
rule
is
to
fill
a
bowl
with
flour
and
drop
a
ring
into
it
then
press
the
flour
down
so
tightly
that
it
will
keep
its
shape
when
turned
out
on
a
plate
each
of
you
must
cut
out
a
slice
and
any
one
who
finds
the
ring
will
be
married
this
sure
asked
lollie
henry
laughing
yes
sure
asserted
rawlins
gravely
come
fairy
after
i
read
the
charm
cut
your
slice
cut
it
like
a
pie
and
wherever
you
then
rawlins
read
the
charm
little
ring
within
the
flour
waiting
for
this
witching
hour
tell
me
where
it
is
you
on
side
or

side
now
with
care
the
knife
i
do
i
get

little
ring
now
i
cut
just
at
this
spot
i
get
you
the
fairy
cut
the
slice
and
all
crowded
round
to
learn
the
result
you
do
exclaimed
lollie
as
there
was
no
ring
seen
in
the
fairy
s
slice
one
after
another
they
each
cut
a
slice
and
even
to
the
very
last
one
no
one
secured
the
ring
not
strange
said
rawlins
calmly
as
she
took
away
the
plate
there
wasn
t
any
ring
in
it
of
course
none
of
you
children
will
be
married
this
year
or
for
many
years
then
a
great
laugh
went
up
at
the
way
they
had
been
hoaxed
and
lollie
said
comically
just
my
luck
i
thought
i
might
get
a
rich
wife
who
would
promise
to
wait
for
me
till
i
m
of
age
chapter
x
fortunes
for
all
it
would
seem
that
it
would
be
easy
to
discover
who
the
spooks
were
but
the
secrets
were
well
kept
and
though
several
suspected
that
bernice
forbes
was
present
not
one
connected
her
with
the
elf
and
somehow
the
elf
was
exceedingly
popular
she
had
merry
little
ways
and
was
among
the
foremost
ones
in
any
game
or
trick
she
was
often
chosen
as
a
partner
in
the
hallowe
en
jokes
and
when
at
last
it
was
supper
time
when
they
would
all
unmask
the
elf
was
watched
with
as
much
if
not
more
interest
than
the
others
the
boys
chose
partners
for
the
march
out
to
the
i
ll
take
you
said
lollie
henry
linking
his
arm
in
that
of
the
elf
i
think
you
re
dot
rose
and
yet
i
think
that
red
witch
is
dotty
too
but
i
mostly
think
you
are
so
come
the
elf
shook
her
head
hard
does
that
mean
you
won
t
go
with
me
another
negative
shake
oh
it
means
you
re
not
dotty
an
affirmative
nod
to
this
well
all
right
i
ll
soon
find
out
who
you
are
may
i
fair
elf
escort
you
to
the
spook
feast
lollie
bowed
low
and
then
bernice
accepted
his
escort
and
they
joined
the
line
of
march
dolly
was
with
reggie
stuart
though
neither
of
them
knew
it
and
dotty
was
with
tod
brown
in
equally
blissful
ignorance
they
marched
to
the
and
there
awaited
them
a
true
hallowe
en
table
decked
with
yellow
paper
and
red
ribbons
loaded
with
dainties
of
all
sorts
and
crowded
with
little
gnomes
witches
black
cats
owls
and
goblins
for
souvenirs
it
was
a
welcome
sight
they
all
took
their
seats
and
at
a
given
signal
were
bidden
to
remove
their
masks
rawlins
gave
the
signal
ready
everybody
he
said
when
i
count
three
off
with
your
face
coverings
you
ve
been
hidden
long
enough
and
i
for
one
will
be
glad
to
see
your
happy
smiles
one
two
three
and
already
loosened
off
came
every
mask
and
the
flushed
smiling
faces
looked
eagerly
at
each
other
dolly
was
stunned
when
her
eyes
lighted
on
bernice
for
she
had
concluded
the
elf
was
really
dotty
and
she
thought
the
red
witch
was
grace
but
more
surprised
even
than
dolly
was
lollie
henry
he
caught
sight
of
bernice
s
smiling
face
and
he
fairly
jumped
as
he
involuntarily
exclaimed
by
gum
then
suddenly
his
good
manners
came
to
his
rescue
and
though
disappointed
in
his
partner
he
managed
to
look
pleasant
and
went
on
this
is
an
unexpected
pleasure
i
didn
t
know
you
were
to
be
and
you
wish
i
wasn
t
bernice
flashed
back
for
she
didn
t
misunderstand
him
not
a
bit
of
it
haven
t
i
been
chasing
the
elf
around
all
the
evening
because
you
didn
t
know
it
was
bernice
s
voice
quivered
a
little
she
had
been
so
happy
when
people
were
nice
to
her
and
now
she
caught
sight
of
many
surprised
and
not
altogether
pleased
glances
thrown
her
way
but
i
didn
t
know
anybody
except
maisie
when
one
of
her
rosy
locks
came
out
of
her
brownie
cap
so
how
could
you
expect
i
d
know
you
i
didn
t
expect
it
and
i
m
glad
you
didn
t
know
me
cause
then
you
could
be
nice
to
i
can
be
a
whole
lot
nicer
now
that
i
do
know
you
just
you
wait
and
see
this
speech
and
the
pleasant
smile
that
accompanied
it
were
greatly
to
lollie
s
credit
for
he
didn
t
like
bernice
but
having
got
into
it
as
he
expressed
it
to
himself
he
was
bound
to
put
it
through
as
he
further
informed
himself
with
a
hurrah
and
so
lollie
laughed
and
chatted
with
bernice
as
well
as
with
the
others
near
him
and
the
elf
felt
a
little
better
but
others
were
not
so
as
lollie
and
too
they
hadn
t
his
responsibility
as
a
supper
partner
so
on
the
whole
few
spoke
to
bernice
while
all
laughed
and
joked
with
the
others
dotty
was
not
sitting
near
dolly
but
once
when
she
caught
her
eye
she
frowned
a
little
however
in
the
gay
chatter
that
was
general
no
one
had
much
chance
to
think
of
personal
matters
uncle
jim
himself
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
and
rawlins
at
the
other
end
of
the
wide
board
this
is
downright
fine
uncle
jim
said
i
d
like
to
have
a
party
like
this
about
once
or
twice
a
week
i
declare
i
would
you
d
get
tired
of
us
sir
suggested
tod
brown
we
re
not
always
on
such
good
ain
t
hey
well
i
calk
late
you
re
always
perty
good
good
enough
anyway
don
t
want
childrun
small
danger
of
that
uncle
jim
cried
dolly
laughing
we
re
none
of
us
sprouting
wings
yet
except
gracie
there
and
uncle
jim
laughed
at
his
fairy
niece
sure
enough
i
forgot
grace
s
wings
but
she
ll
moult
em
off
and
be
no
more
angelic
than
the
rest
of
you
re
all
good
enough
for
me
i
think
you
re
as
fine
a
lot
of
little
misses
and
masters
as
ever
i
see
i
d
like
a
picture
of
and
you
re
going
to
have
one
uncle
said
rawlins
rising
from
the
table
soon
with
the
help
of
uncle
jim
s
man
he
had
put
in
position
a
camera
and
bidding
them
pose
he
took
two
or
three
pictures
which
caused
great
exclamations
and
startled
shrieks
those
things
scare
me
to
death
don
t
they
you
said
bernice
to
reggie
stuart
who
sat
at
her
other
side
no
he
returned
rather
uninterestedly
i
m
sort
of
used
to
em
i
ve
been
taken
a
lot
of
times
that
have
you
said
bernice
how
exciting
where
now
as
a
matter
of
fact
reggie
s
experiences
were
not
so
numerous
as
he
implied
and
most
of
the
times
he
had
been
taken
were
failures
so
he
only
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
oh
i
can
t
remember
it
made
so
little
impression
on
bernice
felt
snubbed
and
showed
it
by
looking
cross
reggie
saw
this
and
saying
to
himself
old
sourface
he
turned
back
to
dolly
who
sat
on
his
other
side
good
for
you
reg
she
said
in
a
low
tone
what
for
for
being
nice
to
bernie
forbes
i
saw
you
talking
to
her
she
isn
t
so
bad
now
is
she
dolly
she
s
the
limit
and
if
you
say
to
me
again
i
you
ll
what
and
dolly
laughed
at
the
irate
youth
i
ll
take
you
out
to
berwick
lake
and
drown
you
all
up
goodness
sake
how
ferocious
well
be
sure
to
ask
her
for
a
couple
of
roguish
dolly
knew
reg
wouldn
t
do
this
but
it
did
no
harm
she
thought
to
suggest
it
supper
over
they
returned
to
the
big
hall
and
sat
around
the
roaring
log
fire
while
the
next
entertainment
took
place
lollie
escorted
bernice
dutifully
to
a
chair
and
then
feeling
his
duty
done
he
left
her
and
went
over
to
speak
to
dotty
you
wished
that
on
me
he
said
accusingly
i
thought
she
was
you
why
lollie
henry
i
refuse
to
be
mistaken
for
bernice
forbes
how
dare
you
dotty
s
dark
eyes
flashed
and
she
looked
a
pretty
picture
in
her
mock
rage
needn
t
get
huffy
returned
lollie
serenely
b
is
some
looker
all
right
bernice
was
a
pretty
girl
and
her
green
costume
was
exceedingly
becoming
but
the
last
few
minutes
had
not
been
pleasant
ones
for
since
lollie
s
defection
no
one
had
spoken
to
her
and
she
looked
resentful
oh
i
don
t
know
dotty
returned
she
might
be
pretty
if
she
didn
t
look
cross
enough
to
bite
a
nail
in
guess
she
s
made
that
way
and
can
t
help
it
said
lollie
and
then
they
were
called
to
attention
it
was
to
be
fortune
telling
rawlins
informed
them
and
he
said
if
you
will
all
seat
yourselves
round
the
fire
i
will
tell
each
and
every
one
of
you
just
what
will
happen
in
the
years
to
come
aren
t
you
anxious
to
know
indeed
we
are
cried
several
as
they
took
their
places
rawlins
sat
down
at
a
table
where
were
a
great
many
papers
these
are
fortunes
he
said
indicating
some
neatly
folded
sheets
but
it
would
never
do
to
give
them
out
hit
or
miss
we
must
see
to
it
that
they
get
where
they
belong
and
this
is
the
only
way
it
can
be
done
we
will
invoke
the
assistance
of
the
fire
spirit
you
know
hallowe
en
is
the
birthday
of
the
fire
spirit
or
sun
spirit
or
some
such
thing
my
mythology
is
a
little
rusty
but
you
can
ask
your
teachers
in
school
however
i
ve
invoked
for
your
aid
the
fire
spirit
and
he
will
help
us
get
the
fortunes
right
now
will
some
kind
gentleman
volunteer
to
help
the
fire
spirit
help
me
nobody
offered
as
the
boys
felt
a
little
shy
about
it
so
rawlins
called
on
his
son
clayton
you
ll
do
son
he
said
you
re
not
as
handsome
as
some
of
those
other
chaps
and
not
as
wise
as
some
but
on
the
whole
you
re
a
good
sort
so
come
on
and
help
your
old
clayton
went
up
and
stood
by
his
father
s
side
now
you
see
went
on
rawlins
all
these
are
fortunes
and
all
these
are
small
slips
of
blank
paper
i
take
a
fortune
in
my
hand
i
ask
of
thee
o
fire
spirit
to
tell
me
for
whom
it
is
meant
clayton
please
hold
a
slip
of
blank
paper
to
the
blazing
fire
the
fire
spirit
will
write
upon
clayton
picked
up
the
top
slip
from
the
pile
and
did
as
he
was
told
as
he
held
it
writing
began
to
appear
ah
said
rawlins
as
everybody
watched
a
name
being
written
on
the
paper
by
no
means
that
they
could
see
has
the
fire
spirit
written
son
sir
stammered
clayton
a
little
frightened
at
what
he
saw
can
you
read
it
yes
sir
it
says
dotty
ah
this
fortune
is
for
dotty
is
it
i
will
read
it
you
ll
have
a
career
more
brilliant
each
year
but
you
ll
climb
a
steep
hill
ere
you
get
what
you
will
take
it
dotty
and
keep
it
always
it
may
serve
as
a
guidance
to
your
feet
in
future
years
dotty
came
and
took
the
paper
a
little
bewildered
may
i
have
the
name
the
spirit
wrote
she
asked
yes
oh
yes
indeed
treasure
it
carefully
the
fire
spirit
does
not
always
respond
to
mortal
s
dotty
returned
to
her
seat
and
with
the
rest
sat
breathlessly
watching
while
rawlins
took
up
another
fortune
paper
and
motioned
for
clayton
to
hold
out
another
blank
paper
for
the
fire
spirit
to
write
on
you
re
sure
it
s
blank
are
you
clay
yes
father
and
the
boy
looked
carefully
on
both
sides
it
was
pure
white
he
held
it
out
to
the
fire
and
soon
it
was
written
on
in
a
clear
bold
hand
just
like
dotty
s
it
says
grace
rawlins
ah
my
gracie
s
fortune
i
hope
it
will
prove
a
good
rawlins
then
unfolded
and
read
the
fortune
he
was
holding
as
you
pass
through
future
years
here
are
smiles
and
there
are
tears
but
the
passing
days
will
show
far
more
happiness
than
woe
good
for
you
grace
that
s
a
nice
grace
stepped
up
and
took
her
fortune
and
her
name
paper
and
then
the
next
one
was
tried
this
time
the
fire
spirit
wrote
lorillard
henry
and
the
verse
ran
for
a
few
years
my
boy
you
may
want
for
the
pelf
but
later
in
life
you
will
earn
it
yourself
and
as
the
years
fly
you
ll
get
richer
and
richer
for
you
re
destined
to
be
a
professional

they
all
laughed
at
this

hold
it
closer
to
the

a
pity
and

the
blaze

the
tongs

more
so
clayton
took
a
slip
of
blank
paper
and
fastened
it
securely
in
the
tongs
grip
and
held
it
out
to
the
fire
spirit
in
the
flames
he
began
to
write
at
once
and
in
a
moment
the

out
clearly

the
paper

to
herself

mad
at

s
presence
at
the
party
and
took
this
means
of
showing
it
chapter
xi
the
fire
spirit
dolly
glanced
round
to
see
if
any
one
else
had
noticed
dotty
s
speech
apparently
no
one
had
so
deeming
it
best
to
ignore
it
dolly
said
come
on
bernice
and
laughingly

anxious
to
know
how
the
writing
appeared
on
the
papers
she
didn
t
for
a
moment
believe
in
the
fire
spirit
but
she
was
curious
to
know
the
trick
she
scrutinised
her
paper
but
saw
only
blank
whiteness
then
she
carefully
put
it
in
the
tongs
and
held
it
to
the
fire
sure
enough
there
came
the
writing
at
once
and
it
said

her
try
again
and
this
time
she
read

of

she
cried
what

rawlins
they

much
to

papers
but
none
could
guess
how
a
blank
paper
could
be
written
on
by
the
fire
whether
a
spirit
did
it
or
not

that

said
tad
heartily
he
was
a
born
naturalist
and
often
spent
his
saturdays
wandering
alone
through
the
woods
and
fields
looking
for
new
wild
flowers
or

eggs
to
add
to
his

rawlins
said
ned
but
i
ll
have
to
hustle
to
get
a
house
to
keep
in
two
years
couldn
t
old
fire
spirit
give
me
a
little
more
time
he
might
extend
it
in
case
of
good
behaviour
what
celia
ferris
is
next
here
you
are
celia
though
you
are
a
pretty
creature
you
are
doomed
to
be
a
teacher
for
a
year
or
two
and
then
you
will
wed
the
best
of
men
h
m
seems
to
me
ned
and
celia
will
step
off
at
about
the
same
time
this
caused
great
hilarity
for
ned
s
admiration
for
the
pretty
celia
was
not
altogether
a
secret
celia
blushed
but
did
not
look
at
all
offended
huh
said
joe
collins
no
fun
teasing
those
two
they
like
it
i
cried
celia
blushing
and
then
they
all
laughed
harder
and
beside
went
on
joe
it
said
celia
would
wed
the
best
of
men
now
though
we
all
love
our
neddie
we
can

pedestal
him
as
the

men
can
we
or
can
we
we
can

they
all
shouted
in
rollicking
chorus
and
now
for
the
last
fortune
may
it
prove
the
best
said
rawlins
holding
up
the
last
paper
must
be
mine
said
reggie
stuart
i
haven
t
had
any
it
was
his
and
it
said
you
never
will
have
wealth
you
ll
keep
no
powdered
flunkey
but
you
ll
travel
for
your
health
with
a
and
monkey
fine
and
reggie
laughed
with
the
rest
of
them
i
m
awfully
fond
of
music
and
i
couldn
t
have
chosen
a
better
fortune
myself
think
of
wandering
about
in
the
with
a
monkey
on
a
string
chimed
in
joe
flowers
and
birds
from
tad
catching
coin
like
anything
wound
up
reggie
oh
it
s
a
great
life
i
always
envied
the
the
fortunes
over
dolly
begged
rawlins
to
tell
how
the
fire
spirit
was
induced
to
write
on
the
blank
papers
i
have
a
contract
with
the
spirit
he
declared
and
if
i
order
him
he
will
write
for
me
no
one
else
can
command
oh
now
i
dunno
bout
that
drawled
uncle
jim
who
had
been
an
spectator
of
the
fortune
telling
though
he
had
said
little
s
pose
now
dolly
you
hold
up
this
here
piece
of
blank
paper
an
see
if
the
sperrit
won
t
write
on
dolly
took
the
sheet
of
paper
offered
her
and
put
it
in
the
tongs
slowly
some
writing
appeared
it
said
mr
rawlins
is
fooling
you
make
him
tell
signed
the
fire
spirit
i
thought
so
cried
dolly
and
going
to
him
she
said
coaxingly
now
rawlins
you
must
tell
us
the
fire
spirit
commands
then
i
shall
have
to
of
course
and
rawlins
laughed
well
since
you
will
have
the
veil
torn
from
the
mystery
i
ll
own
up
the
way
to
produce
that
writing
is
simply
to
write
it
on
the
papers
beforehand
with
with
milk
yes
use
a
small
paint
brush
dipped
in
milk
write
your
message
let
it
dry
and
then
when
it
is
held
to
the
fire
the
heat
turns
the
milk
brown
and
the
writing
appears
but
when
i
let
uncle
jim
into
my
secret
i
didn
t
know
he
would
turn
it
against
you
would
have
told
us
anyway
and
dolly
nodded
her
head
at
him
but
it
s
a
good
trick
does
it
always
work
yes
if
you
do
it
properly
it
s
well
to
go
over
the
milk
letters
a
second
time
while
they
are
wet
enough
to
see
then
the
heat
scorches
them
better
also
have
a
care
not
to
let
the
papers
be
handled
or
blurred
before
thank
you
that
s
a
fine
thing
to
know
and
dolly
tucked
it
away
in
her
noddle
for
future
use
she
already
saw
herself
mystifying
bert
and
bob
when
they
came
home
great
isn
t
it
dot
she
cried
her
first
thought
as
always
to
share
every
idea
with
dotty
but
again
dotty
gave
her
the
cold
shoulder
she
heard
but
pretending
not
to
she
turned
to
celia
and
chattered
quickly
dolly
gave
her
a
hurt
look
and
then
as
dotty
glanced
at
her
without
a
responding
smile
dolly
went
deliberately
across
the
room
to
where
bernice
stood
alone
and
neglected
dolly
was
in
defiant
mood
she
was
full
of
wrath
at
dotty
s
attitude
and
she
was
angry
too
at
the
boys
because
they
would
not
be
nice
to
bernice
hello
bernie
she
said
how
d
you
like
your
fortune
i
don
t
like
anything
returned
bernice
her
eyes
stormy
with
discontent
i
want
to
go
we
re
all
going
said
dolly
after
one
dance
uncle
jim
wants
to
see
us
do
a
virginia
reel
and
rawlins
is
going
to
play
for
us
come
nobody
will
ask
me
to
dance
i
want
to
go
just
then
tad
came
up
to
dolly
and
asked
her
to
dance
with
him
not
unless
you
find
a
partner
for
bernice
said
dolly
she
spoke
in
a
low
tone
and
they
turned
away
so
bernice
did
not
hear
but
she
imagined
what
they
were
saying
and
it
did
not
tend
to
make
her
happier
can
t
do
it
said
tad
positively
nobody
will
dance
with
that
lemon
why
look
at
her
doll
she
s
a
human
who
d
dance
with
that
then
i
ll
dance
with
her
myself
i
d
rather
do
that
than
have
her
left
oh
fiddlesticks
leave
her
alone
and
let
s
get
our
places
you
can
t
scare
me
saying
you
ll
dance
with
her
no
sir
not
little
dolly
fayre
she
s
going
to
trip
it
with
yours
truly
and
that
s
all
there
is
about
that
then
dolly
had
an
inspiration
wait
a
minute
she
said
to
tad
and
she
ran
over
to
where
uncle
jim
was
smiling
at
his
guests
aren
t
you
going
to
dance
uncle
jim
she
said
well
now
i
hadn
t
thought
on
t
but
it
s
right
down
nice
of
you
to
ask
me
i
d
like
to
gum
i
d
like
to
but
which
of
all
these
perty
young
misses
would
dance
with
me
i
ask
you
that
why
any
of
them
would
be
proud
to
dance
with
the
host
i
would
myself
only
i
m
engaged
for
it
but
how
do
you
like
the
elf
that
perty
one
in
green
i
d
like
her
mighty
well
if
she
d
honor
let
s
go
and
ask
her
and
dolly
led
the
old
man
across
to
bernice
say
bernie
you
re
the
belle
of
the
ball
uncle
jim
wants
you
to
dance
the
reel
with
that
i
do
if
you
would
give
me
the
honor
and
uncle
jim
made
an
bow
of
deference
and
respect
he
had
the
grace
of
an
beau
and
it
appealed
to
bernice
s
pride
to
be
chosen
by
the
host
of
the
evening
thank
you
she
said
a
little
shyly
and
took
the
arm
of
the
old
man
as
they
found
places
in
the
line
dolly
was
beaming
at
her
success
it
s
all
right
no
thanks
to
you
she
said
to
tad
as
she
returned
to
him
you
re
a
hummer
dolly
and
no
mistake
that
was
a
scheme
you
couldn
t
have
made
any
of
the
boys
take
i
know
it
and
dolly
sighed
then
she
changed
the
subject
for
she
had
no
wish
to
discuss
bernice
further
just
then
as
it
turned
out
uncle
jim
was
a
fine
dancer
and
he
cut
pigeon
wings
and
made
bows
with
his
hand
on
his
heart
bernice
also
a
good
dancer
entered
into
the
spirit
of
the
quaint
dance
and
they
were
by
far
the
most
effective
couple
on
the
floor
as
a
grand
finale
uncle
jim
balanced
up
and
down
the
line
with
bernice
in
gay
whirls
and
then
fairly
swung
her
off
her
feet
in
a
wild
pirouette
good
cried
rawlins
clapping
his
hands
didn
t
know
you
were
such
a
gay
young
buck
uncle
jim
you
ll
have
to
come
to
dancing
class
and
teach
the
youngsters
the
real
thing
flushed
and
smiling
bernice
said
to
her
host
and
partner
and
ran
away
to
the
cloakroom
you
were
splendid
bernie
said
dolly
as
she
put
on
her
wrap
wasn
t
she
dot
yes
said
dotty
coldly
but
i
don
t
care
for
such
boisterous
dancing
oh
you
don
t
said
dolly
mad
clear
through
well
keep
your
preferences
and
opinions
to
yourself
she
turned
her
back
on
dotty
and
adjusted
her
scarf
before
the
mirror
her
pink
cheeks
were
scarlet
and
her
blue
eyes
flashed
with
indignation
it
was
the
injustice
of
dotty
s
attitude
that
hurt
her
she
had
only
tried
to
give
bernice
a
good
time
and
she
couldn
t
see
why
that
should
make
dot
so
horribly
snippy
then
she
heard
exclamations
and
shouts
out
in
the
hall
and
hurried
out
to
see
what
it
meant
at
first
she
thought
the
house
was
on
fire
a
red
glow
showed
through
the
windows
and
from
the
open
door
then
she
discovered
that
it
was
a
glow
of
red
fire
in
honour
of
the
occasion
uncle
jim
had
arranged
it
to
give
them
a
gay
and
pleasant
there
were
fires
burning
in
all
directions
and
the
effect
was
a
general
red
glow
as
bright
as
day
how
beautiful
cried
everybody
for
the
scene
was
like
fairyland
and
then
they
all
thanked
uncle
jim
over
and
over
for
the
party
and
for
his
kindness
and
thoughtfulness
and
the
motors
came
and
the
young
people
were
packed
in
and
sent
rolling
homeward
dolly
was
a
little
silent
for
she
was
deeply
hurt
at
dotty
s
manner
and
had
to
think
things
over
before
she
decided
what
to
do
about
it
all
dotty
on
the
other
hand
was
unusually
gay
she
proposed
singing
songs
and
herself
started
the
tunes
she
laughed
and
chattered
with
everybody
else
but
said
no
word
to
dolly
when
they
reached
their
respective
homes
the
girls
went
into
their
houses
without
a
parting
word
of
to
each
other
chapter
xii
mad
and
measles
the
next
day
was
saturday
and
the
two
d
s
had
planned
to
spend
the
morning
at
treasure
house
studying
first
and
afterward
arranging
for
a
luncheon
they
were
going
to
have
there
the
next
saturday
they
intended
to
ask
four
girls
and
have
a
lovely
party
but
now
the
very
thought
of
it
brought
the
tears
to
dolly
s
eyes
she
was
in
her
room
wondering
whether
to
go
over
to
treasure
house
or
to
wait
for
some
word
from
dotty
they
had
never
had
a
real
quarrel
before
and
dolly
didn
t
know
quite
how
to
manage
it
so
she
watched
from
her
window
to
see
if
dot
would
go
over
and
dotty
did
soon
dolly
saw
her
walking
along
the
path
her
head
up
singing
a
little
song
and
then
she
unlocked
the
door
of
treasure
house
and
went
in
so
dolly
followed
and
went
in
to
find
that
dotty
had
started
a
good
fire
and
was
sitting
at
her
desk
studying
dolly
looked
at
dotty
and
dotty
looked
at
dolly
but
neither
spoke
dolly
thought
dotty
looked
spiteful
and
dotty
thought
dolly
looked
stubborn
and
they
both
did
look
so
and
they
felt
so
dolly
threw
off
her
coat
laid
another
log
on
the
blazing
fire
and
sat
down
at
her
desk
to
study
silence
reigned
and
reigned
with
such
absolute
monarchy
that
each
girl
felt
as
if
she
should
scream
perhaps
you
know
the
tension
of
such
a
situation
both
sat
still
until
arms
and
legs
felt
rigid
faces
were
strained
and
hearts
beat
as
if
they
would
burst
yet
neither
felt
she
could
speak
that
would
be
a
humiliating
admission
of
being
in
the
wrong
which
neither
was
willing
to
make
turned
slightly
away
from
each
other
they
were
not
mutually
visible
yet
each
felt
that
the
other
knew
every
move
she
made
dolly
was
almost
ready
to
cry
her
neck
felt
so
stiff
and
her
arm
so
cramped
she
moved
a
trifle
and
the
sensation
was
as
if
she
had
made
a
disturbance
in
church
she
at
once
became
motionless
again
her
burning
face
showing
her
embarrassed
dotty
of
sterner
stuff
sat
stiffly
still
now
and
then
turning
a
page
of
her
book
with
utmost
deliberation
then
her
foot
went
to
sleep
and
she
wanted
to
get
up
and
dance
on
it
of
course
there
was
no
reason
why
she
shouldn
t
dance
on
it
to
her
heart
s
content
but
if
you
are
acquainted
with
the
peculiar
etiquette
of
getting
mad
you
know
she
would
have
endured
torture
before
she
would
have
done
anything
that
could
have
been
construed
as
sociable
so
the
two
silly
things
sat
there
each
trying
to
study
pretending
to
study
and
really
wondering
what
the
other
was
thinking
at
last
the
burned
out
fire
required
mending
with
a
furtive
glance
at
dotty
dolly
got
up
sauntered
to
the
selected
a
log
with
care
and
laid
it
carefully
on
the
embers
of
the
expiring
ones
glowing
among
the
ashes
dotty
jumped
up
glad
of
a
chance
to
step
on
her
sleeping
foot
and
seizing
the
poker
jammed
dolly
s
log
into
place
so
fiercely
that
it
fell
down
between
the
andirons
i
ll
tend
to
the
fire
said
dolly
coldly
for
a
speech
of
this
sort
was
entirely
permissible
you
think
you
know
all
about
don
t
you
well
that
big
log
will
never
burn
without
a
stick
of
it
would
if
you
d
let
it
alone
you
always
poke
a
fire
till
you
put
it
out
i
don
t
either
i
had
the
fire
all
right
till
you
came
over
and
bothered
with
well
then
fix
it
yourself
smarty
if
you
know
so
much
dolly
flounced
back
to
her
chair
and
sat
down
usually
gentle
and
when
dolly
did
get
stirred
up
she
was
so
miserable
all
through
that
she
couldn
t
control
herself
and
now
she
knew
that
if
she
staid
there
with
dotty
in
those
strained
relations
she
would
very
shortly
burst
into
uncontrollable
tears
dotty
slammed
another
log
on
top
of
the
first
one
took
the
hearth
brush
and
flirted
the
ashes
about
a
little
took
the
tongs
and
fussed
about
with
those
and
then
adjusting
the
fender
with
meticulous
care
went
back
to
her
seat
and
again
silence
took
up
its
sceptre
the
very
clock
could
be
plainly
heard
indeed
it
sounded
as
loud
as
the
click
of
a
typewriter
in
the
gloomy
atmosphere
the
girls
turned
farther
away
from
each
other
until
they
were
fairly
back
to
back
dolly
was
all
the
time
growing
more
and
more
inclined
to
tears
not
tears
of
sorrow
so
much
as
of
indignation
of
weariness
and
of
general
nerve
strain
dotty
tearless
with
no
inclination
to
cry
became
more
and
more
ruffled
with
anger
at
dolly
and
a
vague
jealousy
of
bernice
as
well
as
a
sort
of
remorse
at
her
own
unkindness
to
her
chum
but
what
could
be
done
girls
who
are
mad
at
each
other
can
not
violate
the
canons
of
not
speaking
and
to
speak
first
was
the
deepest
humiliation
so
the
two
little
ninnies
sat
there
dotty
s
feet
went
to
sleep
one
after
the
other
dolly
s
arms
stiffened
and
relaxed
in
turn
the
minutes
dragged
by
like
hours
lessons
were
not
learned
for
how
can
one
put
one
s
mind
on
the
ptolemies
or
their
successors
when
one
is
mad
at
one
s
friend
at
last
somehow
the
motionless
of
the
hammering
clock
managed
to
worm
its
way
to
twelve
a
permissible
if
not
usual
hour
to
go
home
simultaneously
and
with
the
same
air
of
preoccupied
intentness
both
girls
put
away
books
and
papers
and
pulled
on
her
coat
sleeves
dolly
dawdled
over
her
desk
a
moment
hoping
dotty
would
speak
dotty
looked
at
the
back
of
dolly
s
head
decided
it
still
looked
stubborn
and
turned
away
together
yet
miles
apart
they
went
out
of
the
door
dotty
locked
it
with
her
key
she
was
always
the
quicker
one
at
that
and
then
with
an
assumed
lightness
of
step
the
two
silly
young
things
ran
across
their
respective
lawns
and
into
their
respective
homes
merry
and
bright
they
were
at
their
respective
luncheon
tables
for
the
unwritten
law
required
that
their
parents
must
not
know
of
the
tragedy
that
had
befallen
so
when
fayre
informed
dolly
that
her
company
was
desired
for
a
ride
that
afternoon
the
consent
was
prompt
and
willing
and
when
rose
asked
dotty
to
stay
with
genie
while
she
went
out
on
some
errands
there
was
no
objection
raised
but
there
were
two
sore
and
sorry
hearts
in
the
neighbouring
houses
and
two
brains
pondered
over
the
question
of
what
was
best
to
do
dolly
was
unwilling
to
give
up
her
pet
plan
of
helping
bernice
she
couldn
t
explain
entirely
to
her
own
satisfaction
just
why
she
was
so
interested
in
this
project
but
she
knew
she
had
no
unworthy
motive
it
was
not
that
she
was
sure
bernie
was
rich
and
lived
in
the
grandest
house
in
berwick
it
was
not
because
she
wanted
her
for
her
own
particular
friend
but
it
seemed
too
bad
that
a
nice
girl
like
that
should
be
out
of
everything
for
lack
of
a
guiding
hand
and
it
must
be
admitted
dolly
liked
to
play
the
part
of
guiding
hand
dotty
for
her
part
was
mad
because
dolly
had
gone
off
and
asked
the
girls
to
invite
bernice
to
their
party
after
she
had
practically
agreed
not
to
this
was
dolly
s
sole
argument
the
fact
of
her
own
jealousy
of
dolly
s
interest
in
bernice
she
ignored
for
the
present
at
least
so
the
two
foolish
ones
spent
much
of
the
golden
autumn
afternoon
ruffling
the
feathers
of
their
souls
and
persistently
keeping
them
ruffled
that
evening
as
the
fayres
sat
at
dinner
the
telephone
rang
and
fayre
was
asked
for
after
a
time
she
returned
to
the
table
here
s
a
state
of
things
she
said
smiling
yet
looking
serious
too
it
was
rose
telephoning
genie
has
the
measles
or
rather
they
think
she
has
and
so
rose
asks
if
we
ll
let
dotty
come
here
to
stay
till
they
re
well
well
said
fayre
that
s
too
bad
for
poor
little
genie
but
i
rather
think
i
can
guess
the
names
of
two
d
s
who
won
t
be
sorry
about
the
projected
visit
eh
dollykins
dolly
was
stricken
dumb
dotty
coming
for
a
week
maybe
more
long
did
measles
last
anyway
was
it
a
month
could
they
go
without
speaking
all
that
time
long
will
she
be
here
mother
at
last
a
small
scared
voice
said
a
couple
of
weeks
i
daresay
why
t
you
glad
i
thought
you
d
be
overjoyed
not
at
genie
s
illness
but
at
dotty
s
you
tell
her
she
could
come
mother
surely
child
won
t
you
have
the
good
times
though
she
can
have
the
pink
guest
room
said
trudy
kindly
that
s
almost
next
to
doll
s
room
and
they
can
chum
all
they
like
hasn
t
dotty
been
exposed
mother
yes
but
she
has
had
measles
so
she
s
immune
but
she
can
t
go
to
school
if
she
remains
in
the
house
where
the
illness
is
so
she
s
to
come
when
asked
dolly
in
a
queer
voice
now
right
away
replied
her
mother
we
ll
put
aside
that
best
lace
trudy
and
give
her
a
plainer
of
course
i
ll
fix
the
room
mother
you
needn
t
give
it
a
you
re
a
great
help
trude
said
fayre
smiling
at
her
elder
daughter
meantime
the
younger
daughter
of
the
house
of
fayre
was
struggling
with
her
emotions
she
didn
t
know
whether
to
be
sorry
or
glad
and
before
she
had
time
to
decide
dotty
arrived
isn
t
this
great
she
exclaimed
in
a
state
of
excitement
it
s
awful
kind
of
you
fayre
to
take
me
in
but
you
see
i
d
hate
so
to
be
out
of
school
just
now
it
s
near
examinations
and
i
do
want
to
we
ll
pass
you
said
fayre
we
ll
put
you
through
with
bells
on
but
i
expect
you
two
d
s
will
chatter
and
giggle
all
the
time
instead
of
oh
no
we
won
t
and
from
the
cold
smile
dotty
flashed
at
her
dolly
understood
the
feud
was
as
desperate
as
ever
but
the
elders
were
to
be
kept
in
ignorance
of
it
for
a
feud
suspected
by
parents
is
as
good
as
finished
no
real
feud
can
exist
in
the
scathing
beams
of
grown
people
s
ridicule
so
dolly
smiled
coldly
in
return
and
said
no
indeed
in
a
tone
that
ought
not
to
have
deceived
a
jellyfish
nor
did
it
deceive
trudy
something
s
up
she
thought
but
wisely
kept
her
thoughts
to
herself
later
when
the
girls
went
to
bed
they
parted
at
their
doorways
in
the
hall
good
night
dollyrinda
said
dotty
heartily
in
a
voice
loud
enough
to
be
heard
if
any
one
chanced
to
be
listening
i
m
fearfully
tired
so
i
ll
go
right
to
good
night
dotsie
returned
the
other
guileful
one
you
must
be
tired
with
the
worry
about
genie
and
all
good
the
door
shut
and
there
was
silence
as
far
as
the
two
d
s
were
concerned
what
can
it
be
thought
trudy
who
had
heard
the
conversation
but
she
bided
her
time
to
find
out
the
next
day
was
a
trial
being
sunday
the
whole
family
was
much
together
the
two
d
s
were
at
their
wit
s
end
to
preserve
an
apparent
friendliness
without
showing
each
other
any
real
diminution
of
their
desperate
hatred
of
one
another
trudy
eyed
them
when
she
could
do
so
unobserved
and
concluded
that
they
were
mad
at
each
other
silly
little
geese
she
thought
well
remembering
her
own
not
so
far
past
schooldays
she
determined
to
give
them
every
chance
going
over
to
treasure
house
she
inquired
soon
after
dinner
dunno
do
you
want
to
go
dot
said
dolly
with
studied
carelessness
oh
i
don
t
care
dolly
just
as
you
like
and
dotty
s
politeness
was
faultless
of
course
you
do
said
fayre
looking
up
from
his
paper
what
did
i
build
that
house
for
if
you
re
not
to
use
it
shall
we
go
dot
yes
if
you
dolly
did
not
like
at
all
but
fayre
spoke
up
again
run
along
over
kiddies
and
after
a
while
i
ll
saunter
over
myself
i
haven
t
been
there
for
a
week
and
i
like
to
keep
in
touch
with
all
right
dad
come
on
the
two
girls
went
across
the
lawn
side
by
side
wonder
how
genie
is
said
dolly
with
the
laudable
intention
of
making
she
isn
t
sick
you
know
returned
dotty
courteously
the
doctor
isn
t
sure
it
really
is
measles
but
he
ll
know
in
a
day
or
they
went
into
treasure
house
something
about
the
look
of
the
place
got
on
dolly
s
nerves
the
lovely
house
the
dear
furniture
the
beautiful
treasures
and
two
owners
acting
like
a
pair
of
silly
idiots
was
too
much
but
whereas
yesterday
she
had
felt
sad
and
distressed
the
long
trying
hours
had
made
her
irritable
and
angry
and
as
the
door
closed
behind
them
she
burst
out
i
think
you
re
perfectly
dotty
rose
so
do
i
think
are
dolly
fayre
the
of
being
mad
at
me
just
because
i
want
to
do
a
deed
of
kindness
for
a
friend
she
your
why
of
course
she
s
my
you
hardly
know
her
you
don
t
have
to
know
people
such
an
awful
lot
to
be
friends
with
them
if
they
re
nice
huh
i
s
pose
i
m
not
nice
people
then
you
re
not
very
friendly
with
me
neither
are
you
with
me
you
know
so
do
you
know
i
don
t
know
why
and
i
don
t
care
why
if
you
want
old
bernice
forbes
for
your
friend
instead
of
me
you
can
have
her
i
don
t
care
i
don
t
want
her
instead
of
you
do
so
you
like
her
because
she
you
stop
that
dotty
rose
don
t
you
dare
say
that
i
ll
like
her
if
i
want
to
there
now
and
you
can
think
whatever
you
please
i
don
t
care
you
think
a
step
on
the
porch
sounded
and
the
angry
combatants
ashamed
to
be
caught
quarrelling
ran
back
to
the
where
are
you
ladies
of
the
house
called
out
fayre
as
he
and
fayre
stepped
into
the
study
all
right
be
there
in
a
minute
called
dotty
in
a
cheery
voice
as
she
mopped
her
heated
brow
with
her
handkerchief
and
straightened
her
rumpled
collar
and
in
a
moment
two
normally
serene
girls
came
in
the
room
to
receive
their
guests
what
were
you
talking
about
as
we
came
up
the
steps
asked
fayre
in
idle
curiosity
you
were
speaking
so
loudly
and
we
began
dolly
and
stopped
she
was
a
truthful
child
and
since
she
didn
t
want
to
state
the
facts
she
preferred
to
say
nothing
dotty
too
began
to
speak
and
stopped
never
mind
mother
said
fayre
laughing
let
the
girls
have
their
little
chapter
xiii
the
feast
that
failed
that
night
the
two
d
s
put
off
going
to
bed
as
long
as
possible
and
when
at
last
fayre
sent
them
away
laughingly
they
marched
like
two
deaf
and
dumb
drum
majors
what
s
the
matter
with
the
kiddies
asked
fayre
who
couldn
t
help
noticing
their
demeanour
i
don
t
know
i
m
sure
returned
his
wife
but
trudy
laughed
outright
and
said
i
do
they
re
mad
yes
a
school
girl
mad
you
know
neither
will
speak
s
beneath
her
dignity
they
ll
act
like
this
a
day
or
two
longer
and
then
they
ll
make
up
i
know
em
better
speak
to
them
mother
suggested
fayre
and
clear
up
matters
seems
silly
to
oh
i
don
t
believe
i
d
better
interfere
they
ll
fix
it
up
themselves
if
that
s
what
s
the
matter
some
foolish
quarrel
i
it
isn
t
like
them
they
rarely
trudy
looked
thoughtful
but
i
m
sure
it
is
that
they
never
spoke
to
each
other
at
supper
though
each
was
gay
and
chatty
with
the
rest
of
silly
babies
said
fayre
smiling
let
them
work
it
out
themselves
meanwhile
the
silly
babies
were
tossing
on
restless
pillows
in
adjoining
rooms
dolly
and
dotty
were
thinking
hard
though
in
different
moods
dotty
was
tumbling
about
the
bed
throwing
her
arms
out
and
digging
her
face
in
her
pillow
in
the
intensity
of
her
warring
emotions
dolly
was
lying
quiet
and
straight
her
eyes
turned
toward
the
ceiling
her
heart
throbbing
as
she
thought
it
both
rooms
were
flooded
with
moonlight
and
the
two
girls
stayed
awake
far
into
the
night
at
last
about
one
o
clock
dolly
finished
her
cogitations
deliberately
she
rose
and
put
on
her
and
slippers
she
went
to
dotty
s
room
opened
the
door
softly
and
walked
in
then
she
closed
the
door
behind
her
and
going
to
the
bedside
said
you
awake
dots
yep
came
the
surprised
voice
from
the
rumpled
coverlets
well
sit
up
here
then
i
ve
come
to
isn
t
it
late
and
dotty
sat
up
a
little
uncertain
what
attitude
to
assume
of
course
it
s
late
but
i
ve
got
to
have
this
thing
out
i
can
t
go

leaned
forward
and

her
arms
around

convulsive
hug
that
nearly
strangled
her

kissed
the
cheeks

to
throw

dinner
and
dotty
affectionately
pulled
the
golden
curls
and
say
old
dollypops
we
haven
t
planned
much
for
our
luncheon
next
couldn
t
very
well
when
we
were
mad
oh

t
it

the

and
i

sorry
i
was
so
m
i
that
i
and
peace
being
declared
and
ratified
the
two
d
s
went
to
sleep
so
successfully
that
they
were
late
to
breakfast
the
country
s
safe
remarked
trudy
after
the
pair
had
started
for
school
how
do
you
know
asked
her
mother
signs
lots
of
em
they
talked
each
other
not
each
other
and
they
smiled
and
sang
and
were
generally
in
fine
well
i
m
glad
of
it
i
hate
to
have
them
so
childish
and
i
spect
all
girls
are
they
ll
outgrow
it
and
they
are
two
such
sensible
nice
little
girl
chums
that
i
don
t
believe
it
will
happen
nor
did
it
in
all
their
lives
dotty
and
dolly
never
again
had
one
of
those
foolish
mads
that
most
school
girls
know
so
well
they
had
differences
of
opinion
frequently
very
frequently
and
often
they
had
hot
hasty
words
but
the
quarrels
were
of
short
duration
and
ended
amicably
and
lovingly
the
saturday
luncheon
was
duly
planned
they
invited
maisie
the
two
rawlins
girls
and
celia
dolly
would
have
liked
to
ask
bernice
and
dotty
was
more
than
willing
but
they
had
only
room
for
six
too
they
knew
all
the
girls
would
like
it
better
without
the
stranger
and
so
for
this
time
they
decided
against
her
agreeing
that
they
would
invite
her
some
time
soon
it
was
to
be
a
very
festal
occasion
more
the
whole
luncheon
was
to
be
the
work
of
the
two
girls
themselves
not
everything
was
to
be
made
in
treasure
house
but
no
one
save
the
two
d
s
could
have
a
hand
in
the
preparations
and
so
when
saturday
morning
came
they
were
up
bright
and
early
to
begin
their
work
dotty
was
still
at
the
fayres
genie
though
better
was
still
housed
and
the
time
was
not
yet
up
when
dotty
could
return
home
it
doesn
t
seem
fair
doll
said
dotty
as
swathed
in
big
aprons
they
went
into
the
fayre
kitchen
for
me
to
work
over
here
we
ve
always
divided
the
work
that
doesn
t
matter
what
do
you
want
for
the
cake
a
big
bowl
and
a
spoon
i
ll
measure
out
the
things
all
right
and
i
ll
make
the
salad
dressing
two
busy
bees
worked
all
the
morning
barely
having
time
to
set
the
table
in
treasure
house
and
arrange
some
flowers
there
before
their
guests
came
goodness
there
they
are
cried
dotty
as
she
set
a
saucepan
of
lard
on
their
kitchenette
stove
to
heat
i
can
t
leave
this
doll
so
you
go
in
and
do
the
polite
and
i
ll
run
in
when
i
can
they
won
t
so
dolly
serene
and
smiling
met
the
girls
who
all
came
together
what
a
jolly
lark
exclaimed
maisie
the
idea
of
you
two
girls
having
a
lunch
party
and
cooking
everything
ourselves
added
dolly
dot
s
in
the
kitchen
yet
struggling
with
foods
take
off
your
the
guests
complied
keeping
up
a
perfect
stream
of
chatter
as
they
looked
about
and
admired
everything
in
sight
all
had
been
there
before
but
not
to
a
regular
invited
feast
and
the
occasion
was
a
great
one
if
i
had
a
house
like
this
declared
ethel
rawlins
i
wouldn
t
ask
any
more
favours
of
fate
for
twenty
years
nor
i
agreed
celia
isn
t
it
wonderful
don
t
you
just
adore
it
dolly
indeed
we
all
right
this
last
in
answer
to
a
frantic
call
from
dotty
in
the
kitchenette
excuse
me
girls
dot
s
come
to
grief
somehow
amuse
yourselves
till
i
come
dolly
hurried
to
the
rescue
and
found
dotty
throwing
into
the
croquette
kettle
the
old
thing
caught
fire
somehow
she
exclaimed
dancing
about
and
i
never
thought
of
it
before
but
dolly
do
you
think
the
house
is
insured
goodness
i
don
t
know
but
never
mind
that
now
it
isn
t
going
to
burn
down
can
we
save
the
croquettes
or
what
shall
we
have
for
lunch
gingerly
with
a
fork
they
picked
up
the
towels
and
found
a
number
of
black
cylinders
that
had
once
been
dotty
s
carefully
shaped
croquettes
nothing
doing
said
dolly
philosophically
as
she
gazed
at
the
charred
remains
you
got
the
lard
too
hot
so
i
notice
well
we
ll
have
to
cut
out
the
croquette
no
matter
i
ll
skip
over
home
and
get
a
platter
of
cold
lamb
there
was
a
lot
left
last
night
i
know
you
chin
with
the
girls
and
i
ll
dolly
scooted
out
at
the
back
door
of
treasure
house
and
across
to
her
own
home
and
soon
returned
with
a
dainty
dish
of
sliced
lamb
then
she
busied
herself
with
her
own
allotment
of
the
preparations
and
began
to
heat
the
soup
most
ready
said
dotty
flying
in
suddenly
and
startling
dolly
so
she
nearly
dropped
the
yes
in
a
minute
fill
the
water
glasses
set
the
fruit
on
the
table
cut
the
bread
no
we
have
rolls
get
them
fixed
and
hunt
up
the
butter
my
gracious
the
salad
has
upset
not
really
not
entirely
i
can
straighten
it
out
i
guess
oh
why
did
we
ask
them
to
come
so
early
i
ve
heaps
to
do
you
put
the
cocoa
in
the
silver
pot
won
t
you
and
oh
dot
the
olives
haven
t
been
opened
yet
i
ll
do
it
where
s
the
i
don
t
know
i
guess
there
isn
t
any
over
i
guess
there
is
here
it
is
but
it
won
t
work
you
give
it
a
pull
both
girls
together
and
in
turn
pulled
at
the
refractory
cork
of
the
olive
bottle
without
olives
no
school
girl
lunch
is
complete
but
it
refused
to
budge
now
the
ways
of
corks
are
most
mischievous
just
as
they
were
about
to
give
it
up
a
last
strong
pull
brought
the
cork
out
with
a
jerk
and
the
two
d
s
fell
in
a
heap
in
the
middle
of
the
kitchenette
with
such
a
clatter
of
accompanying
dishes
that
the
guests
came
running
out
to
see
what
was
the
matter
they
found
their
hostesses
scrambling
up
from
the
floor
laughing
but
pretty
much
upset
withal
it
was
that
old
cork
explained
dotty
it
wouldn
t
come
out
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
it
couldn
t
get
out
quick
enough
scuse
us
girls
for
such
a
racketty
performance
but
truly
everything
is
going
let
us
help
begged
grace
oh
do
let
us
yes
do
help
said
dolly
who
was
at
the
end
of
her
rope
you
grace
see
if
everything
is
on
the
table
that
ought
to
be
there
ethel
please
put
some
sugar
in
this
bowl
s
the
box
celia
won
t
you
set
these
salad
plates
on
the
side
table
maisie
may
you
just
stand
around
and
look
pretty
don
t
know
of
anything
else
for
you
to
do
now
i
ll
take
up
the
soup
oh
no
i
won
t
we
must
eat
the
fruit
thingumbob
first
come
on
let
s
do
that
i
don
t
see
how
people
get
the
things
ready
at
the
right
time
everything
here
is
either
too
ready
or
not
enough
so
come
on
friends
you
sit
here
maisie
and
grace
laughing
gaily
the
girls
took
their
seats
and
delightedly
attacked
the
dainty
first
course
it
was
a
combination
of
various
fruits
pineapple
and
crimson
cherries
served
in
delicate
glasses
i
just
love
this
fruit
muddle
said
maisie
and
this
is
the
best
ever
who
made
it
i
did
said
dolly
with
pardonable
pride
it
took
most
of
the
morning
though
that
s
why
everything
else
fell
behind
it
isn
t
hard
to
make
but
it
takes
the
two
d
s
were
to
take
turns
in
changing
the
plates
so
dolly
rose
to
bring
in
the
soup
very
pretty
it
looked
in
the
bouillon
cups
but
after
the
first
taste
celia
hurriedly
caught
up
her
glass
of
water
look
out
she
cautioned
but
too
late
nearly
every
girl
had
taken
a
spoonful
of
soup
before
she
discovered
it
was
burning
hot
with
pepper
when
dotty
had
come
upon
dolly
in
the
act
of
seasoning
the
soup
she
startled
her
so
that
far
more
pepper
went
in
than
was
meant
and
the
result
was
appalling
eagerly
the
girls
sipped
the
cold
water
and
with
tears
running
down
their
cheeks
from
the
pungent
taste
and
odour
they
protested
that
they
didn
t
mind
it
i
like
peppery
soup
said
grace
politely
but
you
don
t
like
soupy
pepper
do
you
gasped
dotty
and
that
s
what
this
is
then
dolly
crestfallen
and
chagrined
but
trying
to
be
merry
took
away
the
soup
and
brought
the
cold
lamb
and
the
salad
the
lamb
was
all
that
it
should
be
but
the
salad
dressing
had
separated
itself
into
its
original
ingredients
after
the
manner
of
some
salad
dressings
this
was
harrowing
but
dolly
smiled
bravely
and
acknowledged
it
was
her
first
attempt
don
t
you
mind
doll
said
grace
comfortingly
not
one
of
us
could
make
a
better
one
and
with
the
olives
and
all
you
don
t
notice
anything
the
but
the
crowning
blow
came
with
the
dessert
the
girls
had
made
lovely
ice
cream
and
had
frozen
it
with
the
greatest
care
this
they
felt
sure
would
be
right
for
they
had
made
it
before
many
times
but
alas
by
some
oversight
the
freezer
had
been
left
outdoors
in
the
sun
the
ice
had
been
insufficient
and
the
result
instead
of
a
finely
moulded
form
was
a
lot
of
thick
creamy
liquid
don
t
you
care
cried
ethel
i
just
soft
ice
cream
call
it
a
pudding
and
let
it
go
at
that
come
dot
brace
up
who
cares
for
the
occasional
slips
of
young
housekeepers
cut
the
cake
and
pass
it
to
us
and
give
us
some
of
that
ice
cream
custard
the
cake
had
turned
out
fairly
decent
but
not
up
to
the
mark
dotty
was
a
good
cake
maker
but
making
it
in
a
strange
kitchen
and
baking
it
in
a
strange
oven
had
made
a
difference
and
the
fluffy
sponge
cake
she
usually
achieved
showed
up
a
close
almost
soggy
and
very
sticky
compound
i
m
just
ready
to
cry
said
dotty
as
she
looked
at
the
dessert
from
which
they
had
hoped
such
great
things
don
t
do
anything
so
foolish
said
dolly
we
slipped
up
on
most
everything
but
we
tried
hard
enough
goodness
knows
if
you
re
hungry
girls
there
are
cookies
in
the
cupboard
and
there
s
plenty
of
i
ll
take
some
please
said
maisie
so
plaintively
that
they
all
laughed
and
then
they
all
fell
to
on
the
previously
despised
cookies
and
under
the
cheer
and
raillery
of
their
guests
the
two
d
s
finally
regained
their
poise
and
laughed
themselves
at
their
chapter
of
accidents
call
it
the
feast
that
failed
and
let
it
go
at
that
said
dotty
it
wasn
t
a
failure
at
all
protested
celia
we
ve
had
heaps
of
yes
it
a
failure
insisted
dotty
and
we
ll
have
to
learn
to
do
better
why
when
the
boys
come
home
they
ll
make
all
sorts
of
fun
of
us
if
we
can
t
do
better
than
we
do
better
than
this
declared
dolly
we
ll
ask
you
again
girls
and
show
you
how
great
an
improvement
second
attempts
are
then
i
m
glad
of
this
frolic
said
grace
for
it
means
we
get
two
parties
instead
of
just
what
you
might
have
expected
said
trudy
laughing
till
the
tears
rolled
down
her
cheeks
at
the
d
s
account
of
the
feast
you
little
geese
not
to
know
that
you
couldn
t
do
it
now
i
ll
take
you
in
hand
and
give
you
a
few
practical
lessons
and
then
when
the
boys
come
home
you
can
astonish
them
with
your
skill
and
all
right
said
dolly
i
ll
try
to
learn
won
t
you
dots
well
i
rather
just
guess
yes
exclaimed
the
other
chapter
xiv
news
indeed
i
have
a
piece
of
news
for
you
said
fayre
as
the
family
sat
at
dinner
one
night
what
is
it
dads
asked
dolly
as
her
father
paused
he
was
still
silent
and
his
face
looked
a
little
grave
as
his
eyes
rested
in
turn
on
his
two
daughters
and
on
their
guest
for
dotty
was
still
there
after
a
moment
he
said
i
m
afraid
it
will
hit
you
hard
trudy
and
i
know
it
will
make
dolly
miserable
so
i
hate
to
tell
you
but
it
must
be
told
i
ve
been
ordered
to
for
a
moment
the
girls
didn
t
take
in
just
what
he
meant
then
trudy
cried
go
to
buffalo
to
live
all
of
us
well
trude
i
certainly
couldn
t
leave
any
of
my
family
behind
me
mother
and
i
are
going
and
i
guess
you
girls
better
come
along
dolly
sat
looking
at
her
father
her
eyes
very
wide
and
very
blue
as
she
thought
over
what
he
was
saying
we
can
t
do
it
she
said
finally
and
as
if
she
were
disposing
of
the
whole
matter
i
can
t
go
away
from
berwick
to
but
dolly
dear

exclaimed
dotty
excitedly
why
she
ll
to
i
won
t
let
my
dollyrinda
go
away
from
berwick
she
s
mine
and
i
ve
got
to
keep
her
is
it
really
true
father
asked
trudy
looking
very
thoughtful
must
we
go
yes
dear
answered
fayre
the
company
has
transferred
me
to
the
buffalo
office
and
i
must
obey
or
leave
the
road
you
know
a
freight
superintendent
is
under
orders
from
his
there
isn
t
anybody
superior
to
you
daddy
said
dolly
who
was
looking
blank
and
stunned
at
the
news
she
had
heard
can
t
you
tell
the
president
or
whoever
is
sending
you
that
you
won
t
go
i
might
dolly
but
that
might
mean
my
entire
dismissal
and
who
d
buy
your
then
my
girl
but
to
buffalo
wailed
dolly
we
might
as
well
go
to
timbuctoo
it
s
awful
said
trudy
with
a
sigh
did
you
know
about
it
mother
yes
some
days
ago
and
i
knew
how
sorry
you
girls
would
feel
but
i
know
you
ll
brace
up
and
meet
the
disappointment
bravely
for
father
s
sake
he
doesn
t
want
to
hurt
his
girls
so
but
he
can
t
help
what
will
bert
say
said
dolly
won
t
he
be
mad
i
don
t
think
bert
will
care
as
much
as
you
girls
began
fayre
when
dotty
interrupted
my
dollyrinda
go
i
won
t
have
it
i
ll
make
my
father
buy
her
for
me
and
keep
her
here
that
s
what
i
ll
do
don
t
be
silly
dots
said
dolly
who
was
beginning
to
realise
that
this
thing
was
a
fact
apparently
her
parents
had
already
become
used
to
the
idea
and
were
regretting
it
principally
on
the
girls
account
do
you
want
to
go
father
dolly
asked
would
you
just
as
lieve
live
in
horrid
old
buffalo
as
here
in
beautiful
lovely
berwick
no
dolly
i
wouldn
t
but
i
must
obey
whose
orders
the
general
manager
why
that
s
forbes
isn
t
it
bernice
forbes
father
that
s
the
is
he
sending
you
away
not
directly
that
is
not
personally
but
he
and
the
board
of
directors
have
combined
to
decree
this
thing
they
consider
it
an
honour
dolly
it
is
a
better
position
financially
and
i
have
earned
it
by
my
integrity
and
exemplary
behaviour
fayre
smiled
at
his
younger
daughter
and
was
so
honestly
sorry
for
her
that
he
didn
t
know
what
to
do
well
daddy
i
can
t
stand
it
and
dolly
shook
her
head
i
ll
just
die
that
s
all
i
couldn
t
live
anywhere
except
here
you
couldn
t
get
me
another
treasure
house
or
another
dotty
rose
or
all
our
crowd
at
school
or
anything
that
i
have
but
buffalo
may
be
full
of
dotty
roses
and
treasure
houses
and
school
crowds
that
are
heaps
nicer
than
the
berwick
variety
fayre
tried
to
speak
gaily
but
at
these
words
dolly
burst
into
tears
and
dotty
followed
suit
the
family
left
the
table
and
though
they
tried
to
have
calm
and
general
conversation
the
effort
was
vain
and
very
soon
the
two
d
s
went
off
they
went
to
dolly
s
pretty
bedroom
and
here
their
woe
broke
out
afresh
oh
wailed
dolly
i
can
t
leave
this
room
this
pretty
sweet
lovely
room
and
go
to
old
buffalo
to
sleep
in
an
attic
with
rats
gnawing
me
why
would
you
do
that
and
dotty
stopped
midway
of
a
sob
to
understand
this
dire
prognostication
well
it
s
as
bad
as
that
whatever
it
but
if
your
father
gets
more
money
more
salary
you
know
maybe
you
ll
have
a
grand
house
like
the
i
don
t
want
a
grand
house
if
it
s
in
buffalo
at
all
i
d
just
as
lieve
have
the
ratty
attic
as
anything
else
and
dolly
renewed
her
weeping
she
rocked
her
plump
body
back
and
forth
in
paroxysms
of
woe
and
wailed
out
new
horrors
as
they
came
to
her
distorted
imagination
know
the
sort
of
girls
they
ll
have
there
all
wearing
shirtwaists
and
old
ribbon
bands
round
their
foreheads
oh
i
know
how
do
you
know
and
dotty
s
admiration
rose
at
these
strange
revelations
oh
i
sort
of
see
them
the
horrid
bunch
i
hate
to
see
girls
of
our
age
in
shirtwaists
and
i
they
ll
all
have
them
and
the
boys
will
be
horrid
too
not
nice
like
our
brothers
and
tad
and
tod
but
all
sort
of
outgrown
my
buffalo
must
be
an
awful
place
it
isn
t
only
buffalo
it
s
place
in
the
united
states
except
berwick
don
t
you
see
it
dotty
don
t
you
it
must
be
so
and
if
not
just
as
i
ve
described
it
s
something
equally
worse
yes
i
s
pose
so
returned
dotty
awed
by
this
instinctive
knowledge
of
dolly
s
but
i
ve
got
to
go
all
the
same
so
i
ve
got
to
make
up
my
mind
to
you
shan
t
go
and
you
shan
t
make
up
your
mind
to
it
i
won
t
have
it
say
doll
how
about
this
if
you
do
go
visit
me
six
months
every
year
and
i
ll
visit
you
six
no
if
i
go
i
shall
give
you
up
entirely
and
get
a
new
chum
up
there
i
can
t
have
my
most
intimate
friend
a
million
miles
away
and
you
know
our
people
wouldn
t
agree
to
that
six
months
you
ll
get
a
new
chum
dorinda
fayre
i
think
you
re
the
most
awful
girl
i
ever
saw
i
believe
you
to
go
to
your
horrid
old
buffalo
and
have
a
girl
with
a
shirtwaist
on
for
your
intimate
friend
and
a
band
around
her
forehead
oh
hush
up
dotty
i
didn
t
mean
that
and
you
know
it
but
i
m
beside
myself
i
don
t
know
what
i
m
saying
and
then
the
two
girls
gave
way
to
such
desperate
and
uncontrollable
sobbing
that
trudy
heard
them
and
came
to
their
room
dolly
dolly
she
exclaimed
oh
you
poor
little
girl
don
t
cry
so
darling
try
to
stop
ll
make
yourself
dotty
be
quiet
trudy
s
soft
voice
calmed
the
turbulent
ones
a
little
and
she
went
on
talking
listen
dollykins
i
don
t
want
to
leave
berwick
either
i
have
lots
of
friends
and
beaux
put
in
dotty
suddenly
realising
trudy
s
trials
too
yes
trudy
agreed
smiling
and
beaux
but
probably
beaux
grow
in
buffalo
and
friends
of
other
sorts
too
now
i
don
t
in
the
least
undervalue
what
it
means
to
you
two
girls
to
part
but
dolly
it
can
t
be
helped
father
has
to
go
now
oughtn
t
we
to
help
him
by
unselfishly
forgetting
our
wishes
and
going
cheerfully
that
s
the
only
way
we
can
help
dad
and
i
think
it
s
our
duty
to
do
i
know
it
is
sobbed
dolly
but
i
always
hate
to
do
my
duty
but
you
always
do
it
and
trudy
smiled
at
her
little
sister
i
ve
never
known
you
to
shirk
a
duty
because
you
hated
to
do
but
i
never
had
such
a
big
horrid
awful
bad
duty
no
and
that
s
all
the
more
reason
why
you
must
meet
this
one
bravely
now
don
t
think
any
more
about
the
whole
thing
go
to
bed
and
to
sleep
and
things
will
look
the
girls
both
felt
sure
they
would
lie
awake
all
night
but
so
exhausted
were
they
by
their
strenuous
grief
they
fell
asleep
before
they
knew
it
but
dolly
woke
early
in
the
dawn
of
morning
and
she
lay
there
in
her
pretty
green
room
thinking
it
out
and
somehow
her
thinking
cheered
her
for
at
rising
time
dotty
awoke
to
see
a
smiling
dolly
bending
over
her
wake
up
old
sleepyhead
get
your
eyes
open
and
rise
to
greet
the
morn
dotty
rubbed
her
black
eyes
and
strove
to
remember
what
was
the
matter
after
all
then
it
all
came
back
to
her
buffalo
she
said
sitting
up
in
bed
never
mind
buffalo
and
dolly
kept
on
smiling
you
wake
up
and
get
yourself
up
into
berwick
and
if
you
ll
be
a
good
girl
some
day
i
ll
tell
you
you
ve
been
thinking
it
out
exclaimed
dotty
i
know
you
don
t
deny
it
course
i
ve
been
thinking
it
out
but
don
t
you
tell
anybody
that
i
have
you
get
dressed
instanter
do
you
hear
dotty
heard
and
obeyed
and
soon
two
calm
serene
girls
were
on
their
way
down
to
breakfast
the
subject
was
not
mentioned
at
the
table
the
elders
purposely
avoided
it
and
the
two
d
s
had
no
desire
to
discuss
it
it
was
only
as
she
was
starting
for
school
that
dolly
said
to
her
mother
with
a
quivering
lip
in
about
a
month
dear
said
fayre
kissing
the
trembling
mouth
don
t
begin
to
think
about
it
the
two
d
s
started
off
in
silence
after
a
block
or
so
dotty
said
shall
you
tell
the
girls
no
said
dolly
shortly
don
t
mention
it
dot
this
afternoon
in
the
house
i
ll
tell
you
dotty
could
scarcely
wait
till
afternoon
and
then
when
that
time
arrived
dolly
decreed
that
they
should
learn
their
lessons
first
before
she
told
the
you
re
getting
terribly
good
grumbled
dotty
i
know
it
i
ve
to
be
perhaps
i
ll
get
something
i
so
the
two
studied
like
everything
until
they
both
declared
they
really
knew
all
the
next
day
s
lessons
they
even
heard
each
other
some
of
the
very
hardest
ones
and
then
they
sat
down
together
before
the
fire
for
the
here
it
is
said
dolly
soberly
i
m
going
to
get
father
let
off
from
that
transfer
to
you
can
t
said
dotty
with
an
air
of
calm
conviction
i
know
i
can
t
but
i
m
going
to
all
the
same
father
doesn
t
want
to
go
neither
does
mother
nor
trudy
nor
me
so
why
should
we
go
cause
your
father
is
yes
that
s
just
it
but
i
m
going
to
get
him
amend
the
constitution
just
about
that
now
look
here
dot
who
is
sending
dad
mr
of
course
he
is
he
s
father
s
boss
now
who
is
forbes
boss
the
president
of
the
railroad
i
s
not
at
all
forbes
is
bossed
and
ruled
and
absolutely
commanded
bernice
yes
of
course
he
worships
and
idolises
his
motherless
girl
and
listen
now
through
bernice
i
m
going
to
get
father
repealed
whatever
you
call
can
you
i
will
whether
i
can
or
will
your
father
like
it
he
won
t
know
till
it
s
all
over
and
if
i
fail
which
i
won
t
he
need
never
know
i
ve
thought
it
out
and
it
isn
t
wrong
there
isn
t
a
wrong
thing
about
it
bernice
can
make
her
father
do
anything
in
the
world
she
wants
to
i
know
that
so
she
can
get
him
to
change
his
mind
about
my
father
if
i
can
persuade
her
to
do
it
i
mean
if
i
can
persuade
her
to
persuade
her
it
s
a
fine
scheme
dollops
but
i
can
t
seem
to
see
it
succeeding
bernice
can
make
her
father
do
anything
she
wants
for
herself
but
this
is
different
why
should
she
bother
her
father
for
your
father
s
sake
i
don
t
know
and
dolly
looked
uncertain
but
i
m
going
to
try
to
make
her
do
it
and
sumpum
tells
me
i
shall
conquer
in
the
fight
dolly
looked
so
jubilant
so
already
victorious
that
dotty
hadn
t
the
heart
to
express
further
doubt
and
too
dotty
had
great
faith
in
dolly
s
powers
of
success
when
she
set
to
work
in
earnest
and
she
surely
was
very
much
in
earnest
now
aren
t
you
going
to
tell
trudy
or
your
mother
no
nobody
at
all
but
you
maybe
i
ll
tell
bert
when
he
comes
home
for
thanksgiving
he
could
help
can
help
you
i
mean
i
will
if
you
ll
tell
me
what
to
indeed
you
can
help
me
dot
i
couldn
t
do
it
at
all
without
your
help
see
here
you
don
t
understand
yet
if
bernice
makes
her
father
do
this
thing
it
ll
be
because
she
herself
wants
me
to
stay
in
berwick
and
here
s
why
because
bernice
does
what
i
want
her
to
i
m
going
to
make
her
the
most
popular
girl
in
town
chapter
xv
dolly
and
bernice
dolly
went
alone
to
see
bernice
she
had
wanted
dotty
with
her
for
aid
and
sympathy
but
on
thinking
it
over
she
decided
it
would
be
better
to
go
alone
first
the
forbes
house
was
impressive
the
man
who
opened
the
door
to
dolly
s
ring
was
but
of
these
things
dolly
was
not
afraid
her
fear
was
that
she
would
not
be
able
to
present
in
the
most
persuasive
way
the
strange
matter
on
which
she
had
come
when
bernice
came
into
the
reception
room
she
found
dolly
so
deep
in
thought
she
scarcely
heard
her
hello
dolly
fayre
said
the
hostess
looking
at
her
inquiringly
what
do
you
want
you
never
could
guess
returned
dolly
not
resenting
this
somewhat
ungracious
greeting
oh
yes
i
can
you
want
to
beg
some
money
for
some
high
school
performance
or
else
you
want
me
to
be
on
some
rubbishy
old
committee
you
never
came
here
just
because
you
wanted
to
see
me
this
frightened
dolly
for
it
struck
perilously
near
the
truth
but
she
plunged
boldly
in
you
re
not
far
out
bernice
and
yet
it
s
nothing
about
school
can
any
one
hear
us
no
but
i
ll
shut
this
door
now
what
is
it
bernice
s
curiosity
was
roused
by
dolly
s
air
of
repressed
excitement
and
her
very
evident
embarrassment
at
least
something
unusual
was
coming
bernice
she
began
you
know
my
father
is
in
the
employ
of
your
father
s
railroad
my
father
is
in
the
freight
yes
i
know
it
what
of
it
well
your
father
has
ordered
my
father
to
be
transferred
to
oh
dolly
i
don
t
want
you
to
go
to
buffalo
why
you
re
the
only
friend
i
have
in
well
this
is
the
point
bernice
you
ought
to
have
more
friends
in
berwick
with
your
home
and
everything
you
ought
to
be
the
most
popular
girl
in
i
m
not
and
bernice
laughed
grimly
that
s
partly
your
own
fault
and
partly
not
now
if
you
ll
persuade
your
father
to
retract
that
order
and
let
my
father
stay
in
berwick
i
ll
make
you
popular
will
honest
dolly
s
eyes
beamed
with
earnestness
her
plea
was
out
now
it
was
to
follow
it
up
i
know
that
sounds
crazy
she
went
on
but
think
a
minute
bernice
your
father
and
mine
are
splendid
business
men
so
perhaps
we
inherit
their
business
talent
so
let
s
make
a
business
deal
if
i
can
make
good
and
put
you
in
the
front
ranks
of
our
crowd
will
you
try
to
coax
your
father
to
do
what
i
want
why
dolly
fayre
what
an
idea
i
know
it
but
i
don
t
want
to
leave
berwick
none
of
us
do
and
yet
we
ll
have
to
go
unless
your
father
changes
the
orders
i
d
ask
him
myself
only
i
know
he
wouldn
t
listen
to
me
but
he
would
to
does
your
father
know
you
re
doing
this
mercy
no
i
wouldn
t
have
him
know
it
for
the
world
it
isn
t
wrong
bernice
and
it
isn
t
underhanded
or
anything
like
that
you
know
yourself
how
the
railroad
men
are
ordered
here
and
there
now
it
seems
to
me
some
one
else
might
as
well
be
sent
to
buffalo
and
my
father
left
in
the
new
york
office
where
he
is
now
don
t
you
think
so
if
only
your
father
will
illustration
i
ll
make
you
popular
will
honest
dolly
looked
very
pleading
her
little
face
looked
up
into
bernice
s
with
a
wistful
hopeful
smile
her
hands
were
clasped
in
the
intensity
of
her
feeling
and
her
voice
quivered
as
she
made
her
plea
bernice
looked
at
her
i
don
t
know
why
i
should
do
this
for
you
dolly
fayre
she
said
at
last
you
re
the
most
popular
girl
in
berwick
you
and
dotty
rose
now
if
you
go
away
i
ll
stand
a
better
chance
of
getting
in
your
crowd
in
your
place
than
if
you
stay
dolly
hadn
t
thought
of
this
nor
did
it
strike
her
at
the
moment
what
a
selfish
and
spirit
bernice
showed
she
knit
her
brows
as
she
thought
deeply
what
to
say
next
you
see
bernice
went
on
i
ve
always
wanted
to
be
in
your
set
it
s
the
nicest
set
of
all
and
when
i
was
in
grammar
school
of
course
i
couldn
t
but
now
we
re
all
in
high
i
want
to
be
one
of
you
and
i
ll
do
anything
i
can
to
get
there
but
i
think
i
d
stand
a
better
chance
with
you
away
then
i
d
be
friends
with
dotty
rose
in
your
place
dolly
looked
aghast
such
presumption
but
the
absurdity
of
the
idea
brought
her
to
her
senses
not
much
you
wouldn
t
bernie
she
said
dot
is
willing
to
do
a
lot
for
you
if
i
stay
here
but
she
knows
i
m
saying
all
this
to
you
and
if
you
don
t
help
me
about
father
s
position
with
the
road
you
can
just
bet
dotty
rose
won
t
have
anything
to
do
with
you
nor
will
any
one
else
in
our
set
look
here
dolly
isn
t
this
what
the
boys
call
a
dolly
laughed
it
did
sound
like
that
but
listen
bernice
it
s
a
straight
proposition
you
want
to
be
in
our
set
really
in
it
and
of
it
well
i
ll
see
to
it
that
you
get
there
if
you
ll
coax
your
father
to
let
my
father
stay
here
that
s
all
and
i
don
t
think
it
s
mean
or
i
think
it
s
a
fair
deal
between
us
i
don
t
know
what
my
father
would
say
if
he
knew
i
asked
you
but
even
though
he
might
think
it
undignified
or
silly
he
couldn
t
say
it
was
really
wrong
now
could
he
no
agreed
bernice
there
s
nothing
wrong
about
it
but
can
you
do
your
part
can
you
yes
i
know
i
could
i
can
make
dad
do
anything
he
spoils
me
he
d
move
to
kamchatka
if
i
wanted
to
or
send
anybody
else
there
if
i
said
yes
i
knew
he
was
like
that
it
s
a
shame
bernie
with
all
your
lovely
home
and
privileges
and
everything
that
you
re
not
top
of
the
heap
well
i
m
not
and
i
m
not
at
all
sure
dolly
fayre
that
you
can
help
to
put
me
anywhere
near
the
oh
yes
i
how
by
making
the
girls
come
to
see
me
or
by
forcing
the
boys
to
dance
with
me
i
know
of
your
efforts
in
those
directions
and
don
t
you
s
pose
they
make
me
feel
cheap
bernice
i
don
t
wonder
and
i
m
glad
you
spoke
like
that
no
i
don
t
mean
to
do
it
that
way
entirely
but
if
we
go
into
this
bargain
you
and
i
it
must
be
a
real
bargain
and
you
must
help
hinder
any
part
of
oh
dolly
i
d
only
be
too
glad
to
help
if
i
could
be
popular
don
t
mean
actually
top
of
the
heap
but
just
liked
by
the
crowd
i
d
be
so
glad
and
if
you
could
help
bring
it
about
i
d
make
father
do
what
you
want
i
know
i
could
but
i
won
t
do
it
unless
you
do
what
you
say
you
all
right
bernice
and
dolly
looked
thoughtful
but
you
see
if
dad
s
orders
are
changed
i
suppose
it
ought
to
be
done
at
once
and
i
can
t
do
my
part
all
in
a
jiffy
it
will
naturally
take
a
little
yes
i
see
that
when
does
your
father
expect
to
go
in
about
a
that
ll
be
the
middle
of
december
s
pose
i
get
father
to
postpone
the
date
till
say
after
christmas
the
first
of
the
year
they
often
make
changes
that
ll
give
you
nearly
two
months
and
if
things
are
working
all
right
by
then
i
can
easily
make
father
let
you
stay
here
why
if
i
told
him
i
wanted
you
here
in
berwick
he
d
make
any
arrangements
to
keep
you
then
do
it
now
and
dolly
s
eyes
danced
at
this
easy
settlement
of
the
whole
matter
nixy
you
haven
t
done
a
thing
yet
i
don
t
want
to
be
mean
about
this
you
know
what
i
want
and
it
s
up
to
all
right
bernice
will
you
ask
your
father
to
put
off
dad
s
transfer
till
after
the
holidays
yes
i
will
and
he
ll
do
it
now
what
are
you
going
to
do
first
first
of
all
i
m
going
to
talk
to
you
like
a
dutch
uncle
dolly
s
eyes
were
dancing
now
her
aim
was
accomplished
at
least
in
part
and
her
well
thought
out
campaign
was
about
to
be
begun
you
see
bernice
all
i
can
do
will
not
count
at
all
unless
do
something
to
help
along
and
what
you
ve
got
to
do
is
to
change
your
way
with
em
now
wait
a
minute
you
re
pretty
and
bright
and
you
have
lovely
clothes
and
all
that
but
you
go
around
with
a
chip
on
your
shoulder
yes
you
do
and
it
upsets
your
whole
now
you
ve
just
simply
to
be
sunny
and
sweet
and
if
you
think
you
see
little
slights
or
mean
things
swallow
them
and
keep
on
smiling
i
know
that
sounds
hard
even
sounds
silly
but
that
s
all
there
is
to
it
you
ve
got
to
break
down
that
sort
of
barrier
you
ve
built
up
around
you
do
you
know
what
they
say
about
you
they
say
you
re
that
s
an
awful
thing
in
our
crowd
we
don
t
like
people
you
re
so
rich
you
see
so
much
richer
than
any
of
the
rest
of
us
that
we
feel
sort
of
shy
of
you
unless
you
come
down
to
our
level
i
mean
our
level
as
to
grandeur
and
style
and
those
things
we
don
t
care
if
you
have
silk
dresses
when
we
have
gingham
if
you
don
t
rub
it
in
oh
you
see
what
i
mean
i
don
t
know
as
i
do
dolly
and
bernice
looked
very
serious
but
i
begin
to
and
i
do
believe
i
can
learn
but
it
s
so
hard
when
everybody
turns
the
cold
shoulder
and
nobody
wants
to
speak
to
but
it
s
so
much
your
own
fault
have
you
ever
tried
real
hard
to
be
nice
to
any
of
the
girls
real
up
and
down
no
i
ve
been
too
busy
paying
them
back
for
the
snubs
they
gave
that
s
just
it
and
they
only
snubbed
you
because
they
thought
you
were
snubbing
them
oh
i
know
all
about
it
bernice
don
t
you
s
pose
i
ve
heard
them
talk
you
over
and
the
boys
they
say
you
re
a
pretty
girl
and
a
good
dancer
i
m
going
to
tell
you
right
out
for
i
believe
it
will
help
you
call
you
a
lemon
they
do
do
they
then
i
don
t
want
anything
to
do
with
them
yes
you
do
now
hold
on
they
call
you
that
cause
you
lemony
to
them
you
know
yourself
that
you
snip
and
snap
the
boys
awfully
they
won
t
stand
but
dolly
i
haven
t
the
sweet
sunny
disposition
that
you
then
get
it
you
can
if
you
want
to
good
gracious
bernice
if
you
to
be
popular
and
have
a
good
time
isn
t
it
just
too
easy
to
quit
being
a
sour
old
lemon
and
work
up
an
amiable
manner
anybody
would
think
i
was
asking
you
to
do
something
hard
why
it
s
easier
to
be
pleasant
than
not
if
you
only
think
so
now
that
s
of
your
part
next
you
must
invite
people
give
a
party
yes
if
you
like
i
meant
ask
just
a
few
at
a
time
but
it
would
be
a
good
scheme
to
start
in
with
quite
a
party
not
too
gorgeous
a
nice
it
ll
be
my
birthday
week
after
next
i
might
have
it
just
the
thing
you
do
that
and
let
me
help
plan
your
party
you
mustn
t
have
a
grand
ball
you
i
ll
do
just
as
you
say
dolly
replied
bernice
meekly
all
right
and
dolly
laughed
this
is
like
planning
a
campaign
and
i
s
pose
it
s
sort
of
foolish
for
girls
of
our
age
but
you
re
in
wrong
and
if
i
can
set
you
right
i
m
only
too
glad
to
and
i
if
you
ll
do
as
i
i
m
jolly
to
do
as
you
say
but
will
the
crowd
come
to
my
party
course
they
will
i
ll
make
em
now
wait
i
know
you
don
t
like
to
have
them
come
cause
they
re
made
to
but
it
s
got
to
be
that
way
at
first
and
then
it
s
up
to
you
to
make
it
so
pleasant
they
ll
want
to
come
but
seems
to
me
doing
most
of
oh
that
s
the
way
it
seems
to
you
does
it
it
well
i
don
t
want
to
hurt
your
feelings
but
you
it
without
me
and
see
where
you
bring
up
dolly
was
a
little
annoyed
at
bernice
s
readiness
to
accept
her
advices
and
ignore
the
very
real
help
that
dolly
was
able
and
willing
to
give
i
know
dolly
i
sort
of
forgot
well
you
try
to
remember
yourself
and
remember
too
that
while
i
want
you
to
be
one
of
us
at
the
same
time
i
m
bothering
about
you
for
the
reason
i
told
you
when
i
first
came
here
i
m
not
doing
it
for
your
sake
but
for
my
own
and
another
thing
i
want
to
stay
in
berwick
mostly
because
dotty
rose
is
here
and
she
and
i
are
intimate
friends
and
always
will
be
she
s
ready
and
glad
to
help
us
in
this
scheme
but
it
s
because
she
wants
to
keep
me
here
in
berwick
so
bernice
forbes
don
t
you
try
to
come
between
dot
and
me
for
it
won
t
do
a
bit
of
good
and
it
will
do
you
a
lot
of
i
won
t
honest
dolly
but
does
dotty
know
all
about
your
plan
every
bit
and
i
tell
you
bernie
if
dot
and
i
set
out
to
make
you
have
a
good
time
you
ll
it
and
that
s
all
there
is
about
that
i
believe
you
and
i
m
glad
you
re
so
outspoken
dolly
now
honest
i
m
going
to
try
but
you
don
t
know
how
hard
it
is
to
be
nice
to
those
girls
when
they
turn
aside
and
whisper
to
each
other
about
me
and
all
things
like
they
won
t
do
that
bernice
if
you
act
differently
toward
them
now
look
here
you
talk
over
your
party
with
your
father
and
if
he
says
you
can
have
it
get
your
invitations
out
soon
my
brother
and
dot
s
will
be
home
for
thanksgiving
is
your
birthday
the
of
good
they
ll
be
here
then
well
you
ask
your
father
about
your
party
that
other
matter
will
you
yes
i
will
and
he
ll
say
yes
to
chapter
xvi
brothers
and
fudge
it
was
a
few
days
later
that
fayre
announced
to
his
family
the
news
that
his
transfer
of
locality
had
been
postponed
until
after
the
christmas
holidays
perhaps
you
won
t
have
to
go
at
all
father
said
trudy
perhaps
not
agreed
fayre
these
matters
are
uncertain
i
should
be
glad
not
to
leave
berwick
for
i
like
my
new
york
business
and
my
suburban
home
but
what
is
to
be
will
be
whether
it
ever
comes
to
pass
or
this
was
one
of
fayre
s
favourite
nonsense
speeches
and
always
made
the
girls
laugh
dolly
laughed
now
perhaps
a
little
more
than
the
occasion
demanded
for
she
knew
a
small
joke
of
her
own
dotty
too
controlled
her
smiles
discreetly
and
as
the
subject
was
lightly
passed
over
no
one
suspected
that
the
postponement
was
due
to
dolly
s
endeavours
bernice
forbes
is
going
to
have
a
party
dolly
said
after
a
time
is
she
said
fayre
interestedly
when
on
the
thirtieth
it
s
her
birthday
i
spect
it
will
be
a
lovely
party
can
i
have
a
new
frock
mother
why
i
think
so
you
need
one
more
new
party
dress
this
winter
and
you
may
as
well
have
it
for
that
i
thought
bernice
wasn
t
much
liked
by
your
crowd
said
trudy
well
she
isn
t
a
favourite
said
dolly
slowly
but
i
think
she
s
better
liked
than
she
used
to
be
anyway
everybody
ll
be
glad
to
go
to
her
yes
said
trudy
and
then
talk
about
her
afterward
i
think
that
s
i
do
too
chimed
in
dotty
but
bernice
is
nicer
than
she
used
to
be
more
pleasant
you
know
and
maybe
there
won
t
be
anything
to
say
about
her
party
except
nice
she
ll
probably
have
a
brass
band
and
supper
from
new
york
laughed
trudy
well
i
want
you
to
be
nice
to
her
dolly
said
fayre
mr
forbes
has
been
exceedingly
kind
to
me
of
late
and
if
you
can
do
anything
for
his
motherless
girl
you
do
yes
dad
said
dolly
meekly
though
her
heart
was
singing
for
joy
that
she
was
already
carrying
out
her
father
s
wishes
why
i
thought
forbes
was
an
awful
strict
stern
man
said
trudy
he
is
returned
her
father
and
he
s
a
just
and
particular
man
in
his
business
relations
as
of
course
he
ought
to
couldn
t
you
ask
him
father
not
to
let
us
go
away
from
berwick
suggested
dolly
timidly
gracious
no
child
i
wouldn
t
dream
of
such
a
thing
if
he
says
go
i
must
go
but
he
spoke
as
if
the
matter
were
still
in
in
where
never
mind
your
geography
dollums
you
wouldn
t
find
abeyance
in
any
christian
country
i
mean
he
spoke
as
if
my
going
away
is
still
oh
well
i
m
glad
of
it
every
day
here
before
bernice
s
birthday
party
came
off
dolly
had
much
to
do
and
dotty
ably
aided
and
abetted
her
plans
they
lost
no
opportunity
to
hint
to
the
girls
and
boys
of
bernice
s
good
traits
they
even
said
to
some
that
she
had
been
misunderstood
and
enlisted
their
sympathies
for
the
new
candidate
for
favours
bernice
herself
tried
hard
to
do
her
part
naturally
shy
hers
was
the
disposition
that
takes
quick
offence
at
a
seeming
slight
and
supersensitive
to
such
she
often
felt
like
returning
a
haughty
stare
but
she
remembered
dolly
s
instructions
and
managed
fairly
well
to
control
her
quick
temper
and
overlook
many
things
a
few
days
before
the
party
bob
rose
and
bert
fayre
came
home
from
their
school
for
the
thanksgiving
vacation
great
rejoicing
was
in
the
two
families
at
this
event
dotty
had
returned
home
genie
being
all
well
again
and
treasure
house
was
the
daily
meeting
place
of
the
quartette
my
stars
girls
but
this
is
fine
declared
bert
as
the
two
d
s
showed
off
their
possessions
you
bet
it
is
chimed
in
bob
as
he
paraded
round
the
house
taking
in
all
its
glories
it
was
the
day
of
their
return
they
hadn
t
been
in
town

dolly
smiling
at

begin
now
what

cried
dolly
in
dismay
for
her
brother
was
ruthlessly
rummaging
in
the
cupboard
for
goodies
unhand
me
villain
and
bert
shook
off
dolly
s
restraining
hand
i
seek
what
i
seek
and
with
a
flourish
he
brought
out
a
package
of
chocolate
and
the
sugar
bowl
fee
fi
fo
fum
i
smell
the
scent
of
fudgerum

it
dollops

how
quick
you
can
turn
out
a
panful
bert
took
out
his
watch
as
if
to
time
her
one
two
three
go
falling
into
the
spirit
of
the
thing
dolly
whisked
out
a
and
spoon
while
twice
as
quickly
dotty
seized
a
knife
and
began
to
shave
off
the
chocolate
fudge
was
a
thing
they
make
with
no
chance
of
failure
so
the
two
worked
smoothly
together
and
in
an
incredibly
short
time
the
delectable
compound
was
cooling
to
be
cut
into
squares
you
re
the
right
sort
of
sisters
for
a
chap
to
have
said
bob
looking
admiringly
at
the
two
smiling
flushed
faces
before
him
you
re
two
pretty
good
brothers
dotty
flashed
back
and
bert
remarked
cut
out
the
taffy
and
look
after
the
so
they
marked
it
off
in
squares
and
diamonds
and
the
impatient
boys
began
on
it
at
once
guess
we
ll
bring
home
some
chaps
for
the
christmas
vake
hey
bob
and
bert
nodded
at
his
chum
that

a
go
but
not
many
for
this
house
has
all
the
modern
improvements
except
size
it
seems
to
oh
it
holds
quite
a
good
many
dolly
said
we

a
time
and
it
wasn
t
so
awfully
all

ll
bring
chalk
and
cheese

piece

dolly
gravely
as
she
handed
her
brother

plate
now

here
bert
and
you
too
bob
i
ve
got
you
sweetened
up

dolly

to
the
half
of
my
kingdom
now

m
serious

and
bert
grinned
i
know
the
fair
bernie
none
for
this
citizen
thank
you
what
you
want
me
to
take
her
to
a
party
i
ll
bet
well
you
lose
see
now
bert
be
quiet
and
dolly
gave
him
a
pleading
glance
don
t
jump
at
things
so
be
still
a
all
right
put
in
bob
my
chum
at
his
sister
s
request
will
now
be
mum
but
i
ll
take
the
floor
i
hereby
assent
that
us
two
being
for
the
moment
in
a
position
to
grace
the
fair
town
of
berwick
by
our
gracious
presence
utterly
decline
to
spoil
our
all
too
short
stay
in
these
parts
by
so
much
as
an
allusion
to
the
impossible
forbes
but
you
listen
and
dolly
looked
so
honestly
distressed
that
the
boys
woke
up
to
the
fact
that
she
was
serious
fire
away
then
said
bert
but
cut
it
short
what
s
it
all
about
it
s
this
burst
out
dotty
for
dolly
couldn
t
seem
to
find
the
right
words
we
re
booming
bernice
and
you
two
have
got
to
help
help
help
cried
bert
faintly
do
i
get
you
aright
you
do
and
dotty
wagged
her
black
head
vigorously
you
sure
do
now
the
situation
is
let
me
tell
said
dolly
who
had
recovered
her
nerve
for
reasons
of
my
own
which
i
will
not
explain
at
present
but
which
affect
you
bert
as
much
as
me
it
is
necessary
that
we
make
bernice
what
exploded
bob
bernice
popular
oh
jiminy
crickets
that
s
a
good
one
yes
popular
repeated
dolly
severely
and
if
it
seems
so
difficult
to
you
then
there
will
be
all
the
more
glory
in
accomplishing
it
now
don
t
stop
to
argue
just
realise
that
we
re
going
to
do
it
look
on
it
as
a
stunt
to
be
wrastled
somehow
chip
in
and
help
us
are
you
wid
us
or
agin
us
dolly
was
standing
now
and
flung
out
her
arms
like
an
importunate
orator
pleading
for
the
sympathies
of
his
audience
a
determined
fire
shone
in
her
deep
blue
eyes
a
determined
smile
curved
her
red
lips
and
as
she
paused
for
a
reply
bob
shouted
to
the
last
ditch
good
for
you
and
dolly
thanked
him
with
a
beaming
smile
now
bert
of
course
you
re
in
it
too
so
here
s
the
game
we
four
are
to
do
all
we
can
in
a
clever
and
quiet
way
to
make
bernice
forbes
party
a
howling
success
told
you
it
was
a
party
growled
bert
hate
parties
no
you
don
t
hate
parties
you
love
em
and
this
party
is
next
tuesday
and
if
you
two
boys
don
t
go
in
and
win
re
no
good
what
s
it
to
you
doll
asked
her
brother
detecting
the
earnest
note
in
dolly
s
voice
it
means
a
lot
bert
and
dolly
s
voice
shook
a
little
but
never
mind
that
now
you
two
just
do
as
we
ours
not
to
reason
why
exclaimed
bob
ours
but
to
do
or
die
and
we
ll
do
anything
or
anybody
you
say
now
as
to
details
what
is
our
special
rôle
at
this
party
racket
just
this
said
dotty
to
push
up
bernice
s
stock
be
awfully
nice
to
her
yourselves
make
the
other
boys
be
nice
to
her
too
see
that
she
has
a
partner
for
every
dance
and
a
good
time
at
every
game
whatever
they
have
hover
round
her
at
supper
time
and
in
general
make
her
think
she
s
it
well
sweet
sister
what
you
say
goes
but
you
ve
given
us
a
pretty
large
order
you
know
the
lady
i
take
it
yes
but
you
don
t
at
least
you
don
t
know
that
she
s
a
heap
nicer
than
she
used
to
be
also
you
don
t
know
what
a
great
big
whopping
reason
there
is
for
all
this
if
you
did
you
you
d
fly
over
there
at
once
there
d
be
no
holding
you
and
can
t
we
know
not
just
now
said
dolly
looking
mysterious
some
day
if
you
re
good
i
may
tell
you
till
then
you
must
work
in
the
dark
oh
you
good
boys
i
knew
i
could
depend
on
you
have
some
more
oh
thank
you
much
say
if
we
promise
to
do
all
and
more
than
mortal
can
ask
to
further
that
crazy
project
of
yours
can
we
drop
the
subject
for
now
yes
but
remember
you
ve
promised
and
dotty
shook
her
finger
at
the
two
jolly
boys
who
were
willing
to
please
their
sisters
but
who
took
little
interest
in
bernice
forbes
and
her
success
seems
to
me
observed
bob
as
they
returned
to
discussion
of
treasure
house
that
this
is
too
good
a
piece
of
property
for
two
simple
girls
why
it
s
worthy
of
boy
occupants
want
to
rent
it
bob
laughed
dolly
we
ve
been
weeks
getting
it
into
shape
and
fixed
just
exactly
as
we
want
it
and
we
don
t
propose
to
have
a
lot
of
boys
rampoosing
all
over
it
you
are
invited
to
inspect
it
then
i
don
t
know
as
you
ll
be
asked
well
i
like
that
why
we
supposed
you
d
give
us
the
freedom
of
it
while
we
re
at
home
at
oh
we
won
t
lock
you
out
except
when
we
re
studying
said
dotty
but
there
won
t
be
much
studying
while
you
re
home
for
it
s
our
vacation
just
then
a
rap
sounded
on
the
brass
knocker
of
treasure
house
and
bob
flung
open
the
door
to
admit
the
three
rawlins
and
two
browns
hullo
cried
tad
and
tod
together
when
did
you
fellows
get
home
just
answered
bert
as
they
all
said
hullo
to
each
other
and
then
found
seats
for
themselves
on
chairs
or
floor
and
then
a
general
chattering
broke
loose
everybody
talked
at
once
and
bob
and
bert
were
welcomed
back
like
long
lost
brothers
but
soon
the
boys
all
had
their
heads
together
telling
of
clayton
s
wonderful
new
football
and
the
girls
had
grouped
themselves
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
and
were
eagerly
discussing
bernice
s
party
we
re
going
now
doll
shouted
bert
going
over
to
clayt
s
all
us
fellows
don
t
weep
ladies
but
we
leave
you
all
right
said
dotty
we
can
spare
you
of
course
we
just
hate
to
have
you
go
but
if
you
oh
we
ll
come
back
but
it
s
too
great
a
day
to
stay
inside
you
girls
had
better
go
out
for
a
run
maybe
we
will
said
dolly
but
wait
a
minute
boys
i
want
to
ask
you
something
won
t
you
each
promise
to
dance
twice
with
bernice
at
her
party
goodness
gracious
bernice
again
and
tod
brown
pretended
to
fall
in
a
faint
yes
again
and
yet
and
all
the
time
declared
dolly
laughing
at
tod
s
ridiculous
antics
now
own
up
you
know
you
can
t
go
to
her
party
and
not
dance
with
why
go
demanded
clayton
of
course
you
ll
go
wild
horses
couldn
t
keep
you
away
but
as
you
re
going
why
not
be
decent
about
it
and
do
the
really
nice
thing
if
each
of
you
will
dance
twice
and
a
few
others
once
she
will
have
all
the
partners
she
are
you
her
press
agent
dolly
what
has
come
over
you
asked
tad
never
you
mind
about
that
you
just
do
as
i
now
tad
was
pretty
apt
to
do
as
dolly
said
and
so
he
bowed
and
scraped
saying
what
you
say
goes
two
is
number
hey
fellows
two
it
is
sung
out
tod
and
the
rest
voiced
agreement
now
can
we
go
mum
begged
tad
yes
said
dolly
you
re
good
boys
and
you
may
run
and
what
you
up
to
dolly
asked
grace
as
the
boys
ran
off
laughing
and
jumping
about
gracie
you
know
how
much
i
want
to
make
bernice
more
popular
well
this
is
my
chance
and
i
want
all
you
girls
to
help
me
if
we
take
her
up
and
are
nice
to
her
the
boys
will
do
as
we
tell
them
and
the
other
girls
will
fall
in
line
and
it
will
be
all
right
but
if
we
fall
down
on
it
the
whole
plan
will
drop
through
be
on
my
side
won
t
you
grace
wily
dolly
knew
that
ethel
would
do
whatever
grace
did
and
also
that
maisie
may
would
agree
to
whatever
the
rawlinses
agreed
to
yes
i
will
declared
grace
i
think
we
haven
t
been
very
nice
to
bernice
and
i
m
ready
to
try
to
be
friends
with
her
if
she
ll
have
it
but
dolly
you
know
she
isn
t
very
easy
to
be
nice
i
know
grace
but
i
think
we
ll
find
her
better
natured
nowadays
any
way
let
s
be
awful
nice
to
her
at
her
own
party
and
try
to
make
it
a
grand
all
right
said
grace
i
ll
do
all
too
said
ethel
and
then
dolly
was
satisfied
chapter
xvii
booming
bernice
dolly
hesitated
about
telling
bert
of
her
plans
she
wanted
him
to
know
the
importance
of
the
matter
and
yet
she
feared
he
would
disapprove
of
the
whole
idea
so
she
put
off
telling
him
and
now
the
very
day
had
arrived
and
she
had
a
feeling
that
he
must
know
before
he
went
to
the
party
dolly
was
dressed
early
she
had
on
her
new
frock
and
a
dainty
pretty
affair
it
was
made
of
white
net
it
was
frilled
with
many
little
outstanding
ruffles
edged
with
blue
silk
tiny
garlands
of
blue
headed
the
flounces
and
edged
the
round
neck
of
the
bodice
her
golden
curls
were
caught
back
by
a
pearl
barrette
and
a
delicate
wreath
of
encircled
her
head
dotty
s
dress
was
just
like
dolly
s
with
pink
rosebuds
in
place
of
the
blue
flowers
of
course
the
quartette
were
to
go
together
but
there
was
yet
nearly
half
an
hour
before
time
to
start
dolly
sat
in
her
room
thinking
it
out
and
at
last
decided
to
tell
bert
she
went
to
his
room
and
found
him
deeply
absorbed
in
tying
his
necktie
she
sat
down
and
waited
silently
being
too
wise
to
interrupt
the
engrossing
performance
at
last
the
bow
was
completed
to
the
young
man
s
satisfaction
hello
dolls
he
said
to
her
reflection
in
his
mirror
here
for
criticism
or
commendation
and
he
looked
leniently
on
the
pretty
new
frock
neither
and
we
ve
only
a
few
minutes
so
listen
bert
i
want
to
tell
you
fire
away
and
the
preoccupied
boy
looked
over
a
pile
of
handkerchiefs
dolly
spoke
quickly
and
to
the
point
she
told
him
of
her
bargain
with
bernice
and
all
she
hoped
from
it
you
see
i
couldn
t
just
leave
berwick
and
dot
so
i
tried
this
plan
and
i
hope
most
it
will
succeed
dorinda
fayre
you
re
a
hummer
was
bert
s
comment
and
he
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
his
bed
and
looked
at
his
sister
what
you
s
pose
dad
would
say
if
he
knew
he
know
but
it
isn
t
wrong
is
it
why
no
i
don
t
say
it
s
wrong
exactly
but
it
doll
it
s
crazy
that
s
what
it
is
crazy
i
don
t
care
how
crazy
it
is
if
it
works
why
bert
anybody
can
go
to
buffalo
as
well
as
for
us
to
go
and
probably
the
other
man
wants
to
go
and
father
doesn
t
and
i
don
t
and
trudy
doesn
does
trudy
know
of
your
stroke
of
state
no
indeed
she
d
tell
and
dad
and
mother
might
put
a
stop
to
it
now
bert
help
me
you
dolly
had
the
whip
hand
and
she
knew
it
bert
was
very
proud
of
his
pretty
sister
and
as
she
smiled
winsomely
in
all
the
bravery
of
her
party
array
he
hadn
t
the
heart
to
refuse
her
moreover
though
he
was
amazed
at
her
daring
project
it
seemed
to
him
possible
owing
to
forbes
indulgence
of
his
daughter
s
whims
why
of
course
dollops
i
ll
do
whatever
i
oh
you
old
bert
i
was
afraid
you
wouldn
t
you
can
do
such
heaps
you
know
now
let
s
start
and
you
must
just
remember
every
minute
at
the
party
that
you
re
booming
bernice
get
the
boys
to
show
her
attentions
but
for
goodness
sake
let
them
know
what
you
re
up
to
dollydoodle
do
you
think
i
m
a
ninny
don
t
tell
how
to
conduct
this
publicity
campaign
give
me
credit
for
a
grain
of
sense
leave
all
to
me
bert
waved
his
hand
with
a
lordly
air
and
dolly
felt
a
great
weight
lifted
from
her
shoulders
if
bert
took
the
initiative
like
that
he
was
sure
to
succeed
does
bob
know
he
asked
no
i
don
t
want
to
tell
bob
if
we
can
help
it
dotty
promised
not
to
tell
anybody
can
t
we
manage
without
letting
any
more
know
than

know
i
spect
so
kiddy
run
along
and
get
your
bonnet
and
shawl
and
let
s
get
at
this
dolly
ran
away
for
her
wraps
with
a
light
heart
what
a
bert
was
to
be
sure
trudy
helped
her
on
with
her
pretty
party
cape
and
adjusted
a
chiffon
scarf
over
the
curly
head
then
she
kissed
her
and
the
brother
and
sister
started
forth
they
stopped
next
door
for
the
roses
and
all
went
to
the
forbes
house
together
they
were
the
first
arrivals
which
suited
dolly
s
plans
the
house
looked
very
beautiful
decorated
as
it
was
with
flowers
and
palms
in
the
music
room
they
could
hear
a
harp
and
violin
being
tuned
and
then
bernice
herself
came
smiling
to
greet
them
arrayed
in
a
stunning
gown
of
crêpe
embroidered
with
poppies
it
was
over
elaborate
for
so
young
a
girl
but
it
suited
bernice
s
dark
hair
and
clear
olive
skin
forbes
stood
by
pleasant
and
amiable
but
with
a
natural
stiffness
of
manner
which
he
found
it
hard
to
overcome
forbes
had
been
dead
for
many
years
and
bernice
had
had
little
if
any
company
so
that
forbes
had
drawn
more
and
more
into
himself
and
had
become
a
sort
of
hermit
but
this
evening
he
tried
to
be
sociable
even
jovial
and
he
succeeded
fairly
well
the
two
lived
alone
save
for
a
small
army
of
servants
it
was
forbes
theory
that
an
american
girl
is
capable
of
looking
after
herself
and
he
desired
no
governess
or
companion
for
his
daughter
so
bernice
had
grown
up
with
no
other
mentor
than
her
own
sweet
will
for
her
father
never
interfered
or
advised
in
household
matters
there
was
a
housekeeper
but
she
merely
ordered
the
kitchen
department
and
had
no
supervision
over
bernice
the
party
would
have
been
far
more
elaborate
had
bernice
had
her
own
way
but
dolly
not
wanting
her
protégée
to
be
criticised
by
the
mothers
of
the
berwick
young
people
had
persuaded
her
to
keep
it
simpler
in
details
than
she
wanted
to
what
s
the
use
of
having
plenty
of
money
if
you
don
t
spend
it
bernice
had
demanded
and
dolly
had
not
attempted
to
answer
her
but
had
merely
reminded
her
that
she
had
promised
to
do
her
part
to
reach
their
mutual
goal
and
that
to
abide
by
dolly
s
decisions
would
favour
their
cause
so
there
were
only
three
pieces
of
music
instead
of
a
full
orchestra
only
a
simple
though
fine
and
bountiful
supper
instead
of
the
gorgeous
repast
bernice
would
have
preferred
and
only
a
proper
amount
of
floral
decoration
instead
of
a
city
florist
s
extreme
effort
but
the
house
looked
lovely
and
the
as
dolly
flew
out
to
snatch
a
glance
at
it
was
tastefully
arranged
awfully
good
of
you
forbes
said
dolly
smiling
at
the
rather
man
to
let
us
have
this
not
at
all
not
at
all
said
the
railroad
magnate
rubbing
his
hands
might
just
as
well
have
had
more
more
music
more
people
more
i
said
to
bernie
if
you
re
doing
it
why
not
do
it
up
brown
but
she
she
said
this
brown
said
dolly
laughing
and
it
is
forbes
you
know
yourself
bernie
is
too
young
for
a
real
live
ball
and
that
s
what
it
would
be
if
she
had
it
much
more
grand
than
this
how
beautiful
your
house
is
and
dolly
looked
around
admiringly
glad
you
think
so
hasn
t
been
or
fixed
up
since
my
wife
died
guess
i
ll
have
to
furbish
it
up
a
little
if
bernie
is
going
to
be
in
gay
she
surely
is
you
can
t
keep
such
a
pretty
girl
all
to
yourself
always
no
i
s
pose
s
pose
not
well
i
want
her
to
enjoy
herself
she
s
like
her
mother
her
mother
was
a
great
one
for
gaiety
run
along
now
miss
dolly
and
join
your
young
friends
you
mustn
t
be
wasting
time
on
an
old
man
like
dolly
smiled
at
him
and
then
went
over
to
the
group
already
forming
around
bernice
but
she
had
a
new
bee
in
her
bonnet
nothing
more
nor
less
than
to
make
friends
with
forbes
himself
and
if
need
be
plead
with
him
for
her
father
s
stay
in
berwick
dolly
s
was
a
nature
she
had
set
her
heart
and
mind
to
this
plan
of
hers
and
she
bent
everything
toward
her
aim
buoyed
up
with
hope
she
came
laughingly
toward
the
young
people
ah
there
dolly
fayre
sang
out
tad
brown
thought
you
had
deserted
no
indeed
i
m
helping
bernice
receive
s
why
i
spend
my
time
talking
to
her
father
and
dolly
laughed
whimsically
gay
as
a
butterfly
she
smiled
and
chatted
with
everybody
but
also
kept
a
strict
watch
over
her
helpers
in
the
game
nor
was
she
disappointed
in
a
moment
she
heard
bert
and
bob
both
pleading
with
bernice
for
the
first
dance
you
give
it
to
me
said
bert
cause
i
m
dolly
s
pet
but
i
m
dotty
s
ditto
urged
bob
and
besides
i
m
a
much
better
dancer
than
bert
then
give
it
to
me
out
of
charity
said
bert
have
pity
on
a
poor
unaccustomed
to
this
flattering
style
of
conversation
bernice
blushed
with
pleasure
and
grew
coquettish
maybe
i
won
t
give
it
to
either
of
you
she
smiled
maybe
it
s
already
oh
say
not
so
and
bert
assumed
a
tragic
pose
but
if
it
be
tell
me
the
miscreant
who
dares
aspire
and
let
me
at
him
me
too
chimed
in
bob
oh
surely
certainly
me
too
let
us
at
him
the
boys
were
so
ridiculous
that
bernice
burst
into
laughter
and
forbes
drew
nearer
to
see
what
it
was
all
about
others
did
too
and
the
result
was
that
bernice
was
the
centre
of
a
jolly
group
she
finally
settled
the
matter
by
dividing
the
first
dance
and
giving
half
to
each
of
her
suppliants
and
each
claimed
two
more
dances
later
on
and
others
flocked
around
asking
bernice
for
her
dance
card
until
very
shortly
her
card
was
filled
with
several
down
for
extras
bernice
was
supremely
happy
only
a
girl
who
has
been
a
frequently
can
appreciate
the
pleasure
she
felt
in
being
besought
for
dances
dolly
was
satisfied
with
the
behaviour
of
her
colleagues
not
only
the
boys
were
doing
their
part
nobly
but
the
girls
were
now
and
then
chatting
cordially
with
bernice
and
acting
as
if
she
were
one
of
them
all
serene
dolly
asked
bob
as
he
came
up
to
claim
one
of
his
dances
with
her
yes
indeed
and
dolly
s
eyes
shone
you
re
a
trump
bob
i
thank
you
a
thousand
oh
it
isn
t
so
hard
bernie
has
improved
a
lot
since
last
we
met
she
isn
t
nearly
so
pettish
and
stickery
as
she
used
to
be
and
she
s
mighty
pretty
yes
isn
t
she
and
that
dress
is
stunning
on
rather
isn
t
it
i
like
yours
and
dot
s
better
but
i
m
not
much
on
parties
anyhow
these
dance
affairs
bore
me
why
i
thought
you
liked
them
a
college
boy
ought
to
be
crazy
about
oh
i
s
pose
they
re
good
enough
but
i
like
better
a
rollicking
picnic
or
something
silly
you
can
t
have
picnics
in
winter
well
you
can
have
outdoor
sports
there
ought
to
be
skating
i
think
it
s
getting
awfully
i
wish
there
would
be
i
love
to
so
do
i
if
there
is
any
will
you
go
will
i
well
i
just
guess
i
will
but
hold
on
say
dolly
if
we
go
skating
have
we
got
to
lug
the
bernice
person
along
bob
i
m
ashamed
of
you
just
when
i
think
i
ve
got
you
well
trained
you
act
up
like
that
why
of
we
have
she
s
my
chum
and
what
you
do
for
her
you
do
for
oh
jiminetty
i
do
hate
outsiders
you
and
dot
and
bert
and
yours
truly
make
such
a
jolly
four
why
drag
in
others
got
to
be
done
now
don
t
whine
over
it
just
make
up
your
mind
to
it
let
s
make
a
skating
party
for
afternoon
of
about
eight
and
then
afterward
go
back
to
treasure
house
and
make
fudge
or
something
like
all
right
on
the
fudge
but
instead
of
eight
say
no
sir
eight
it
is
and
do
the
inviting
dolly
had
found
out
that
bob
s
bark
was
worse
than
his
bite
he
might
growl
at
the
things
she
asked
him
to
do
but
he
did
them
and
did
them
well
as
for
bert
he
was
putting
things
through
with
a
dash
he
not
only
danced
with
bernice
but
he
sought
her
out
between
dances
and
joked
and
laughed
as
he
passed
her
on
the
dancing
floor
and
many
times
brought
her
to
the
attention
of
others
in
a
way
to
win
admiration
for
her
at
supper
time
the
crowd
got
together
in
a
corner
of
the
big
a
table
exclaimed
tod
brown
oh
what
a
feast
for
the
gods
make
believe
we
re
little
tin
gods
and
get
us
some
of
it
suggested
bert
who
was
seated
by
bernice
i
daren
t
leave
my
seat
it
might
be
snatched
by
a
less
worthy
occupant
you
do
the
foraging
act
tad
get
some
little
there
were
waiters
but
the
crowd
often
thought
it
preferable
to
have
some
of
their
own
boys
secure
viands
for
them
so
tad
and
clayton
rawlins
and
lollie
and
joe
started
and
soon
returned
with
what
joe
called
the
pick
of
the
what
gorgeous
foods
cried
dolly
and
i
m
starving
with
so
m
i
declared
grace
may
i
have
a
tiny
sandwich
a
tiny
sandwich
doesn
t
seem
to
match
grace
rawlins
chaffed
joe
here
s
a
plateful
my
girl
none
too
many
said
grace
have
some
of
mine
bernice
almost
beside
herself
with
joy
at
being
really
in
the
crowd
bernice
smiled
and
joked
with
the
rest
and
in
their
hearts
most
of
them
decided
she
wasn
t
after
celia
ferris
was
not
so
willing
as
the
others
to
accept
bernice
as
one
of
them
and
she
stood
a
little
aloof
i
must
go
for
celia
thought
dolly
as
she
looked
the
group
over
and
found
most
of
them
acting
in
accordance
with
her
orders
so
finding
opportunity
she
said
to
celia
bernice
makes
a
good
hostess
doesn
t
she
good
nothing
exclaimed
celia
in
a
whisper
what
s
the
matter
with
everybody
to
rave
over
her
all
of
a
sudden
well
i
think
she
s
worth
raving
over
dolly
defended
don
t
you
deed
i
don
t
and
i
for
one
won
t
toady
to
her
just
cause
she
s
rich
and
lives
in
a
big
oh
celia
and
dolly
laughed
outright
how
ridiculous
you
s
pose
for
a
minute
that
bert
and
bob
are
nice
to
bernice
for
any
such
reasons
you
know
better
i
don
t
know
as
they
are
you
and
dotty
rose
no
we
re
not
i
like
bernice
for
far
other
reasons
than
that
and
you
d
better
too
unless
you
want
to
be
in
the
and
with
this
dolly
turned
on
her
heel
and
left
the
astonished
celia
with
something
to
think
about
chapter
xviii
bert
and
the
bargain
the
day
after
bernice
s
party
everybody
went
skating
a
lake
on
the
outskirts
of
berwick
obligingly
froze
itself
over
with
a
sufficient
thickness
of
ice
to
be
entirely
safe
so
the
whole
of
the
younger
population
put
itself
on
runners
the
fayres
and
roses
arrived
early
in
the
afternoon
encased
in
warm
sweaters
and
knit
caps
they
braved
the
cold
and
were
soon
swaying
along
the
glassy
surface
dolly
and
dotty
had
decided
not
to
call
it
a
skating
party
but
after
they
tired
of
the
ice
to
ask
half
a
dozen
or
so
to
go
back
with
them
to
treasure
house
later
bernice
came
alone
she
wore
a
new
skating
suit
of
green
cloth
and
a
jaunty
green
cap
with
a
red
feather
there
s
bernice
said
dolly
quickly
to
bert
you
must
go
and
skate
with
won
t
do
it
i
did
my
duty
last
night
and
i
m
tired
of
the
game
get
somebody
bert
laughed
and
skated
off
with
maisie
may
who
had
not
heard
the
colloquy
of
the
brother
and
sister
now
bernice
by
reason
of
her
good
time
the
night
before
seemed
to
take
it
for
granted
that
her
star
was
in
the
ascendant
here
i
am
she
cried
gaily
who
bids
for
the
honour
of
the
first
skate
with
me
she
couldn
t
have
chosen
a
worse
speech
it
was
full
of
arrogance
and
her
condescending
smile
as
she
swung
her
skates
in
her
hand
did
not
attract
the
boys
who
were
present
come
on
dotty
said
joe
collins
let
s
skate
off
i
don
t
want
any
forbes
in
mine
this
dotty
hesitated
for
she
had
promised
dolly
to
help
her
but
joe
urged
her
away
and
the
two
skated
off
dolly
went
straight
to
bernice
and
said
in
a
low
tone
don
t
talk
that
way
bernie
you
scare
them
all
off
they
won
t
stand
your
putting
on
airs
nothing
cried
bernice
don
t
tell
how
to
behave
dolly
fayre
hello
there
tad
brown
put
on
my
skates
for
me
won
t
you
thus
summoned
tad
had
to
obey
and
after
the
skates
were
adjusted
bernice
said
now
for
a
glide
and
perforce
tad
skated
with
her
but
he
made
a
grimace
over
his
shoulder
at
dolly
and
bernice
saw
it
i
won
t
go
with
you
you
rude
thing
she
exclaimed
i
saw
you
wink
at
dolly
fayre
well
tad
exclaimed
haven
t
i
a
right
to
wink
if
i
want
to
but
i
know
what
you
meant
you
meant
you
didn
t
want
to
skate
with
me
come
now
didn
t
you
if
i
did
i
wouldn
t
tell
you
so
said
tad
at
bernice
s
angry
face
and
this
so
enraged
her
that
she
turned
and
left
him
and
skated
off
alone
dolly
was
in
despair
was
all
her
plan
to
fall
through
because
bernice
herself
couldn
t
make
good
what
matter
dollsie
said
lollie
henry
just
arriving
and
seeing
the
woebegone
face
oh
lollie
you
re
my
friend
help
me
out
go
and
skate
with
bernice
and
be
awfully
nice
to
her
no
matter
she
says
won
t
you
lollie
please
sure
said
lollie
looking
into
the
pleading
blue
eyes
what
you
say
goes
me
to
the
bernie
he
skated
after
bernice
overtook
her
and
holding
out
his
hands
said
you
re
a
dandy
skater
catch
on
gladly
bernice
joined
hands
and
in
a
moment
they
were
gaily
skating
among
the
others
dolly
delighted
at
the
sight
looked
about
for
somebody
to
skate
with
herself
a
laughing
face
peeped
from
behind
a
tree
and
reggie
stuart
came
cautiously
forth
hid
from
the
other
one
he
explained
thought
you
d
never
get
her
fixed
up
why
are
in
charge
of
her
goings
and
comings
dolly
cause
i
want
to
be
now

be
good
reg
if
you
re
my
friend
you
ve
got
to
be
bernice
s
too
come
on
let
s
skate
i
m
bothered
in
my
head
and
perhaps
it
will
tangle
up
my
feet
but
we
ll
it
didn
t
on
the
contrary
the
delightful
exercise
soothed
dolly
s
nerves
and
with
every
stroke
she
became
more
her
own
gay
merry
self
look
out
for
yourself
she
cried
as
reggie
nearly
tripped
over
a
chunk
of
ice
yes
i
a
jay
always
getting
in
the
way
nonsense
you
re
a
fine
skater
let
s
catch
up
to
dot
and
as
the
afternoon
wore
on
dolly
saw
several
times
that
bernice
was
standing
alone
and
neglected
several
of
the
boys
at
dolly
s
insistence
or
at
dotty
s
request
had
skated
with
her
but
only
for
short
excursions
and
somehow
all
the
popularity
that
bernice
had
enjoyed
the
night
before
seemed
to
be
fading
away
oh
dear
dolly
sighed
to
herself
i
m
going
to
fail
after
all
last
night
it
was
at
her
house
so
the
boys
and
girls
to
be
decent
but
they
won
t
keep
it
up
and
it
s
all
bernie
s
fault
i
ve
done
all
i
can
but
i
give
up
i
i
must
succeed
in
desperation
she
flew
over
to
bob
rose
bob
please
for
my
sake

and
skate
with
bernice
good
gracious
dolly
why
this
plea
i
ll

it
if
i
must
but
i
d
a
lot

bob
went
and
was
so
pleasantly
polite
and
courteous
that
bernice
had
no
suspicion
that
he
had
been
asked
to
come
hello
he
said
cordially

i
have
the
honour
of
a
glide
with
the
girl
in
green
bernice
smiled
and
consented
gladly
she
was
a
good
skater
and
they
glided
evenly
along
great
little
old
lake
isn
t
it
said
bob
as
they
flew
on
we
haven
t
such
a
good
skating
place
at
school
only
a
skinny
little
river
that
hardly
ever
freezes
but
before
bernice
could
respond
they
heard
bob
s
name
called
by
a
loud
voice
on
shore
and
looking
hack
they
saw
rose
in
his
beckoning
to
bob
scuse
me
just
a
minute
said
the
boy
and
ran
to
see
what
his
father
wanted

said
as

returned
but
i

got
to

a
special
matter
or

wouldn
t
leave

skate
together
before
i

with
a
wave
of
his
cap
bob
ran
off
to
join
his
father
and
bernice
was
alone
again

to
the
rescue

time
she

began

impressed
by
dolly
s
tense
voice
and
harassed
face
bert
obeyed
all
right
little
sister
he
said
trust
big
buddie
to
do
it
up
to
the
queen
s
taste
with
a
flourishing
bow
bert
left
the
two
girls
and
skated
over
to
where
bernice
stood
looking
pettish
and
sulky
ah
there
diana
greeted
bert
been
waiting
for
a
chance
at
you
what
did
you
do
with
bob
his
father
came
and
he
had
to
go
good
boy
to
obey
his
daddy
and
thereby
let
me
have
his
place
come
for
a
whirl
do
you
want
me
to
and
bernice
looked
coquettish
sure
been
living
all
my
life
for
this
moment
wow
you
re
a
peach
of
a
skater
all
crosspatch
girls
what
and
bernice
stopped
short
thinking
she
could
not
have
heard
aright
you
heard
me
said
bert
carelessly
why
didn
t
you
know
you
re
crosspatch
it
s
written
in
every
line
of
your
expressive
bert
was
laughing
so
pleasantly
that
bernice
was
bewildered
did
he
mean
what
he
was
saying
was
it
a
joke
or
what
was
the
explanation
illustration
i
know
all
about
your
bargain
with
my
needn
t
get
huffy
bert
went
on
i
s
pose
you
can
t
help
it
pity
too
such
a
nice
girl
spoiled
by
bad
temper
well
i
don
t
mind
i
like
crosspatches
i
think
you
re
very
rude
and
bernice
tried
to
draw
her
hand
from
his
i
don
t
want
to
skate
with
oh
yes
you
do
too
i
m
one
of
the
nicest
boys
here
and
you
ve
no
reason
to
get
mad
i
m
only
telling
you
the
truth
and
of
course
you
want
to
be
cross
or
you
wouldn
t
be
i
m
cross
oh
no
you
re
our
little
ray
o
sunshine
oh
as
a
matter
of
fact
bernice
was
in
a
towering
rage
she
had
never
before
been
spoken
to
like
this
and
she
didn
t
know
what
to
make
of
it
but
it
was
difficult
to
be
angry
at
a
boy
who
grinned
in
a
most
friendly
manner
even
while
he
said
such
impertinent
things
now
look
here
bernice
forbes
bert
went
on
as
they
skated
smoothly
along
i
know
all
about
your
bargain
with
my
sister
i
think
it
s
a
crazy
idea
but
all
the
same
i
think
it
s
a
fair
deal
and
i
want
to
help
but
dolly
doesn
t
need
help
can
do
all
she
has
set
out
to
do
so
i
want
to
help
you
mayn
t
i
bert
s
frank
boyish
face
was
very
wheedlesome
and
as
he
smiled
at
bernice
she
saw
he
was
in
earnest
and
in
a
kindly
way
meant
just
what
he
said
i
think
you
re
the
strangest
boy
i
ever
saw
she
exclaimed
all
right
let
it
go
at
that
but
let
s
have
this
thing
out
are
you
willing
to
let
me
help
you
help
me
what
don
t
let
s
pretend
you
know
what
i
mean
or
you
want
it
in
plain
english
you
to
be
one
of
the
most
popular
girls
in
berwick
which
is
what
you
to
be
and
be
as
well
as
no
i
can
t
i
ve
excuse
me
you
haven
t
tried
at
least
not
in
the
right
what
is
the
right
way
ah
you
ask
that
then
you
are
willing
to
let
me
help
you
of
course
i
am
if
you
can
do
then
first
of
all
you
must
remove
that
chip
from
your
bert
spoke
so
earnestly
that
bernice
involuntarily
glanced
at
her
shoulder
yes
it
s
there
said
bert
gravely
you
see
bernie
you
think
the
world
owes
you
a
living
and
the
world
is
not
sure
that
it
does
so
you
ve
got
to
earn
that
earn
my
own
living
why
my
oh
can
t
you
understand
parables
i
mean
you
think
berwick
owes
you
a
liking
then
and
really
you
ve
got
to
berwick
like
you
berwick
in
this
case
meaning
the
dozen
or
so
boys
and
girls
of
our
well
then
if
you
know
so
much
how
am
i
to
make
them
first
as
i
said
dislodge
that
very
large
and
elegant
chip
that
adorns
your
shoulder
don
t
feel
grouchy
toward
people
because
they
don
t
run
and
fall
on
your
neck
as
you
why
bert
fayre
you
re
awful
course
i
m
awful
but
i
ve
simply
got
to
put
it
to
you
straight
i
know
what
dolly
s
after
and
i
know
you
can
give
it
to
her
and
yet
it
will
all
be
of
no
use
if
you
don
t
play
up
yourself
you
will
bernice
won
t
you
yes
i
will
but
i
don
t
know
yes
you
know
how
only
you
find
it
hard
all
you
have
to
do
to
make
people
like
you
and
want
to
be
with
you
is
to
like
them
and
be
nice
to
them
you
can
t
just
sit
around
accepting
must
give
what
smiles
kindliness
gaiety
fun
nonsense
real
true
understanding
and
all
the
things
that
go
to
make
a
tiptop
like
dolly
yes
like
my
sister
and
dot
rose
and
maisie
may
and
the
rawlins
everybody
except
me
well
if
you
see
it
that
way
then
act
so
you
ll
put
yourself
in
the
i
m
going
to
try
bert
you
ve
given
me
a
new
i
know
you
thought
dolly
could
do
it
all
and
you
just
sit
back
and
take
favours
as
they
drop
in
your
lap
well
probably
you
can
do
that
some
day
but
first
you
ve
got
to
make
good
see
bernice
had
only
a
chance
for
an
answering
smile
when
dolly
called
to
them
to
come
on
as
they
were
going
home
bert
and
bernice
turned
back
and
joined
the
others
took
off
their
skates
and
started
homeward
the
crowd
separated
to
take
their
various
ways
and
the
two
d
s
asked
a
few
to
go
to
treasure
house
with
them
for
a
fudge
feast
better
come
said
bert
to
bernice
the
girls
make
ripping
and
very
gladly
bernice
went
along
dolly
had
not
meant
to
ask
her
for
she
was
wearied
with
her
afternoon
s
efforts
and
a
little
discouraged
but
she
seconded
bert
s
invitation
and
with
the
two
browns
and
lollie
they
all
went
to
treasure
house
the
boys
built
up
a
roaring
log
fire
while
the
girls
went
to
the
kitchenette
to
make
the
cherished
fudge
let
me
help
said
bernice
in
such
a
gay
sunshiny
voice
that
dotty
looked
up
in
surprise
all
right
bernie
she
said
meeting
her
half
way
you
shave
off
this
chocolate
and
doll
and
i
will
fix
the
other
all
three
worked
with
a
will
and
in
the
shortest
possible
time
consistent
with
good
fudge
the
candy
was
ready
delicious
exclaimed
lollie
rolling
his
eyes
up
who
made
it
all
of
us
said
bernice
but
mostly
dolly
and
dotty
i
only
it
s
the
help
part
that
tastes
so
good
then
and
bert
smiled
at
her
with
a
knowing
nod
this
delighted
bernice
and
expanding
under
the
warmth
of
bert
s
approval
she
tried
her
best
to
be
entertaining
and
in
gayest
mood
she
chaffed
and
joked
until
she
was
really
the
centre
of
attraction
must
go
home
now
she
said
at
last
i
just
hate
to
leave
but
dad
gets
home
at
six
and
he
always
wants
to
see
his
little
girl
there
waiting
for
bernie
if
you
must
go
said
dotty
and
then
all
were
surprised
to
hear
bert
say
i
ll
walk
around
with
you
s
sort
of
thank
you
said
bernice
in
the
nicest
kind
of
way
and
they
started
off
well
said
dolly
as
the
other
boys
had
gone
too
bert
an
old
trump
after
all
bob
was
too
only
he
was
called
off
just
at
the
wrong
he
ll
do
his
part
yet
and
dotty
wagged
her
head
assuredly
i
ll
make
him
do
dot
said
dolly
chapter
xix
the
election
it
can
not
be
denied
that
dolly
had
a
hard
task
before
her
in
what
she
had
undertaken
when
bert
and
bob
went
back
to
school
she
lost
two
very
efficient
helpers
and
her
own
efforts
seemed
to
be
unavailing
dotty
was
willing
enough
to
help
but
she
was
so
herself
she
could
do
little
for
or
with
bernice
and
bernice
herself
was
most
aggravating
just
as
dolly
would
get
the
girls
and
boys
ready
to
do
something
nice
for
her
bernice
would
break
out
in
a
pettish
mood
or
pick
some
silly
quarrel
that
interfered
with
all
plans
there
s
just
this
about
it
dolly
said
to
dotty
one
afternoon
as
they
sat
in
treasure
house
talking
it
over
we
ve
got
to
do
something
desperate
to
boom
bernie
or
i
ve
got
to
give
it
all
up
and
then
she
won
t
ask
her
father
to
let
us
stay
and
we
ll
have
to
go
away
from
the
tears
flooded
her
blue
eyes
and
rolled
down
her
cheeks
dotty
overcome
by
the
thought
burst
into
violent
weeping
you
shan
t
go
dollyrinda
i
won
t
let
you
i
can
t
spare
you
but
that
s
nonsense
dot
we
ve
got
to
go
if
my
plan
falls
through
and
it
has
about
you
said
you
d
speak
to
forbes
i
know
but
i
can
t
do
that
i
ve
thought
it
out
and
i
believe
that
would
be
wrong
because
i
know
dad
wouldn
t
like
me
to
do
it
but
to
bargain
with
bernice
is
different
just
two
girls
you
well
let
s
try
some
new
plan
i
ll
tell
you
doll
let
s
make
her
class
president
we
vote
next
week
you
know
we
ll
electioneer
whatever
you
call
it
make
the
whole
class
vote
for
yes
make
the
whole
class
vote
for
her
i
think
i
see
them
doing
that
well
we
can
get
a
majority
anyway
you
and
i
can
coax
or
bribe
lots
of
the
girls
and
tod
and
tad
will
help
round
up
the
boys
on
our
well
and
dolly
brightened
a
little
maybe
we
could
do
that
bernie
is
so
uncertain
lately
one
day
she
s
as
sweet
as
pie
and
then
she
s
queer
as
a
spidereen
celia
won
t
vote
for
her
i
know
i
bet
i
can
make
celia
vote
for
her
i
know
a
way
and
dotty
wagged
her
head
wisely
dolly
was
too
busy
thinking
to
ask
what
the
way
was
you
see
she
went
on
we
mustn
t
let
bernice
know
we
re
getting
votes
for
her
or
she
ll
get
no
she
needn
t
know
it
but
we
ought
to
get
right
at
it
yes
let
s
go
to
see
the
rawlins
it
was
uphill
work
from
the
beginning
the
two
d
s
canvassed
the
whole
class
and
found
the
tide
of
prejudice
strongly
against
bernice
for
president
this
was
no
more
than
they
had
expected
and
they
set
bravely
to
work
to
induce
individual
members
to
change
their
minds
moreover
the
brown
boys
declined
to
help
they
were
good
chums
of
the
two
d
s
and
they
rather
liked
bernice
at
times
but
they
didn
t
want
her
for
class
president
they
were
nice
about
it
but
very
decided
so
lollie
henry
was
the
only
boy
whom
they
could
depend
on
for
assistance
but
he
was
willing
to
do
anything
and
expressed
an
intention
of
punching
the
heads
of
the
fellows
who
refused
to
do
as
he
advised
them
oh
don
t
do
that
lollie
said
dolly
laughing
to
think
what
means
were
being
proposed
to
aid
her
to
gain
her
point
never
mind
using
such
strong
measures
persuade
them
by
you
don
t
know
the
fellows
as
i
do
dolly
they
won
t
listen
to
argument
and
you
just
to
punch
them
but
i
ll
do
it
gently
if
you
say
bribe
them
advised
dotty
i
got
minnie
dorlon
over
by
giving
her
my
fountain
bribery
and
corruption
exclaimed
lollie
that
is
much
worse
then
punching
heads
oh
all
ways
are
all
right
if
they
work
dolly
declared
the
little
bribes
we
offer
won
t
hurt
anybody
i
m
going
to
get
celia
ferris
s
vote
by
means
of
my
dotty
cried
dolly
your
new
leather
portfolio
yep
celia
is
just
daffy
over
it
and
says
she
ll
vote
for
bernice
if
i
give
her
that
and
on
no
other
condition
oh
i
don
t
mind
and
it
s
no
harm
to
bribe
in
a
little
election
like
this
if
the
girls
want
these
things
they
might
as
well
have
em
and
then
we
get
their
not
a
bad
idea
said
lollie
musingly
i
bet
jim
lee
would
vote
for
anybody
if
i
gave
him
my
last
year
s
skates
and
i
don
t
want
that
s
it
said
dotty
try
every
means
lollie
and
then
we
get
the
bernice
knew
that
she
was
a
candidate
for
the
presidency
but
she
did
not
know
how
dolly
and
dotty
were
working
for
her
election
she
remarked
to
dolly
that
if
she
should
be
made
president
of
the
class
she
should
consider
it
a
mark
of
popularity
more
than
almost
anything
else
and
you
ll
remember
our
bargain
said
dolly
eagerly
yes
i
will
if
i
m
president
it
ll
be
because
the
class
likes
me
of
course
and
i
m
quite
ready
to
admit
that
i
owe
that
liking
in
great
part
to
and
you
ll
do
what
you
promised
of
course
i
will
i
can
easily
make
father
arrange
for
your
father
to
stay
here
i
sounded
him
and
i
found
out
he
ll
do
it
if
i
say
oh
bernice
then
i
think
you
might
do
it
whether
you
get
elected
or
not
for
i
ve
done
everything
i
could
for
you
and
i
can
t
help
the
no
and
bernice
shut
her
lips
tightly
together
i
won
t
speak
to
father
about
it
at
all
if
i
m
not
made
president
a
bargain
is
a
so
dolly
redoubled
her
efforts
but
the
trouble
was
the
opposing
candidate
was
a
favourite
of
all
molly
mooney
a
girl
who
lived
over
on
the
other
side
of
town
was
not
in
the
two
d
s
set
but
she
was
a
merry
girl
whom
everybody
liked
and
so
many
of
the
class
declared
their
intention
of
voting
for
molly
mooney
and
couldn
t
be
persuaded
to
alter
their
decision
it
was
a
very
trying
situation
for
dolly
couldn
t
explain
she
was
so
desperately
anxious
to
have
bernice
elected
and
many
of
her
best
friends
laughingly
refused
to
listen
when
she
urged
them
to
vote
on
her
side
the
contest
promised
to
be
a
close
one
up
to
the
very
day
of
the
election
dolly
and
dotty
never
ceased
trying
to
turn
the
tide
in
their
favour
the
two
girls
felt
sure
they
would
win
but
lollie
said
he
was
doubtful
he
had
persuaded
joe
collins
to
help
him
in
his
electioneering
and
joe
was
doing
it
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
i
don
t
care
a
red
cent
joe
said
who
is
president
it
s
only
a
figurehead
position
anyway
when
a
girl
holds
it
the
committee
decides
everything
but
if
you
two
girls
want
bernice
so
terribly
why
i
ll
help
all
i
can
she
is
in
our
set
and
molly
mooney
isn
t
though
molly
is
an
awful
nice
so
joe
hustled
around
and
announced
the
day
of
the
election
that
he
had
secured
two
more
votes
that
morning
but
some
are
backing
out
he
added
the
fellows
promise
and
they
go
back
on
their
word
awful
mean
but
they
do
all
the
same
now
hy
landon
he
told
me
yesterday
he
d
vote
for
bernice
and
he
told
lollie
he
didn
t
intend
to
at
all
so
you
can
t
the
election
was
to
take
place
directly
after
school
was
out
in
the
afternoon
all
day
dolly
and
dotty
were
in
a
state
of
nervous
excitement
usually
most
exemplary
of
conduct
in
school
hours
this
day
found
them
writing
notes
and
whispering
in
the
class
rooms
and
so
preoccupied
were
they
with
the
one
idea
that
each
missed
a
lesson
but
poor
dolly
thought
to
herself
it
doesn
t
matter
if
i
do
miss
my
lessons
if
i
ve
got
to
move
away
from
berwick
and
then
the
tears
would
force
themselves
to
her
eyes
and
she
had
to
dab
furtively
with
her
handkerchief
after
school
the
two
candidates
went
home
it
was
not
the
custom
for
them
to
stay
to
the
election
molly
mooney
went
off
laughing
and
calling
back
to
her
friends
to
stand
by
her
and
elect
her
bernice
on
the
other
hand
walked
off
without
a
word
her
head
tossing
haughtily
as
if
she
had
no
concern
in
the
matter
the
worst
thing
she
could
do
fumed
dotty
the
ones
on
the
fence
will
be
put
out
at
her
manner
and
will
vote
for
molly
some
other
business
was
transacted
and
then
the
election
began
even
at
the
last
minute
a
note
was
thrust
into
dotty
s
hand
it
was
from
tod
brown
and
it
said
if
i
vote
for
bernice
will
you
give
me
all
the
dances
at
the
high
school
christmas
dance
how
perfectly
ridiculous
exclaimed
dotty
to
herself
and
looking
over
at
tod
she
said
a
noiseless
but
unmistakable
no
all
right
tod
signalled
back
then
i
vote
for
oh
goodness
thought
the
distracted
dotty
what
shall
i
do
it
would
be
idiotic
to
dance
every
dance
with
him
and
it
means
the
casting
she
hastily
scribbled
a
note
which
said
i
ll
give
you
honest
asked
tod
from
across
the
room
cross
your
heart
hastily
dotty
crossed
her
heart
and
tod
signified
assent
to
voting
for
her
candidate
for
dotty
reasoned
if
bernice
isn
t
elected
and
dolly
goes
away
i
shan
t
go
to
the
dance
and
if
dolly
stays
i
ll
be
so
glad
i
won
t
care
i
dance
with
the
votes
were
taken
and
the
tellers
went
into
another
room
to
count
up
breathlessly
the
two
d
s
awaited
the
result
it
seemed
as
if
the
word
would
never
come
at
last
the
door
opened
and
the
tellers
came
back
as
soon
as
she
saw
their
jubilant
faces
dolly
knew
her
doom
they
all
wanted
molly
and
it
must
be
that
molly
was
elected
judging
from
their
smiling
looks
and
sure
enough
the
result
as
stated
was
that
molly
mooney
was
elected
class
president
by
a
majority
of
three
how
awfully
close
said
everybody
and
there
was
general
rejoicing
for
many
of
those
who
had
promised
to
vote
for
bernice
and
who
did
vote
for
her
really
preferred
molly
dolly
said
no
word
but
went
to
the
cloakroom
for
her
wraps
dotty
followed
and
two
more
gloomy
sad
little
countenances
you
never
saw
they
started
homeward
alone
for
they
had
hastened
out
before
the
others
who
went
their
way
where
you
going
said
dotty
as
dolly
turned
a
corner
to
see
bernice
i
told
her
i
d
come
and
tell
her
the
want
me
to
go
with
you
yes
of
course
oh
dot
she
ll
be
awful
i
know
it
but
we
did
our
that
doesn
t
matter
she
ll
be
mad
at
me
all
the
and
bernice
was
when
the
girls
told
her
that
molly
was
class
president
she
turned
on
dolly
like
a
little
termagant
i
knew
you
couldn
t
run
that
thing
dolly
fayre
you
think
yourself
so
smart
bossing
everybody
around
but
you
couldn
t
do
just
that
one
little
thing
don
t
you
talk
like
that
bernice
said
dotty
herself
quite
as
angry
dolly
worked
like
everything
and
so
did
i
if
you
aren
t
the
most
popular
girl
in
the
class
we
can
t
help
it
i
know
you
can
t
said
bernice
dully
but
dolly
she
could
that
s
what
makes
me
mad
she
said
she
d
accomplish
something
and
she
didn
t
do
no
i
didn
t
bernice
admitted
dolly
and
i
m
sorry
i
suppose
now
you
won
t
ask
your
of
course
i
won
t
a
bargain
is
a
bargain
i
said
if
i
won
the
election
didn
t
i
yes
you
well
i
didn
t
win
it
did
i
then
that
s
all
there
is
about
it
and
you
re
not
going
to
ask
your
i
m
not
going
to
ask
my
father
anything
you
haven
t
done
what
you
said
you
would
for
me
and
i
m
not
bound
to
do
anything
for
you
all
right
bernice
and
dolly
got
up
and
left
the
room
and
went
out
of
the
house
she
was
so
blinded
by
her
irrepressible
tears
that
she
didn
t
notice
that
dotty
wasn
t
with
her
she
stumbled
home
and
going
to
her
room
she
flung
herself
on
her
bed
and
had
her
cry
out
then
she
got
up
bathed
her
eyes
and
sat
down
to
think
it
over
but
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
more
to
think
of
she
had
tried
her
best
and
had
failed
there
was
no
other
way
to
try
and
no
hope
for
remaining
in
berwick
now
to
be
sure
she
had
said
she
would
appeal
to
forbes
for
her
father
s
retention
in
his
present
position
but
that
plan
didn
t
seem
right
and
she
abandoned
it
meantime
dotty
had
stayed
behind
with
bernice
you
can
do
anything
you
please
dotty
said
her
eyes
blazing
with
anger
but
i
m
going
to
tell
you
what
i
think
of
you
the
idea
of
letting
dolly
fayre
do
all
she
has
done
for
you
and
then
refusing
to
use
your
influence
with
your
father
for
her
just
because
you
lost
the
election
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
it
isn
t
only
that
but
dolly
said
she
would
make
me
one
of
the
most
popular
girls
in
town
and
she
hasn
t
done
it
a
bargain
is
don
t
say
that
over
again
you
make
me
so
mad
i
a
bargain
is
a
bargain
but
of
course
all
dolly
could
do
was
to
to
make
you
popular
and
she
has
done
that
if
she
couldn
t
succeed
it
s
your
fault
not
hers
but
i
ve
tried
too
at
this
speech
muttered
in
an
humble
voice
dotty
looked
up
in
astonishment
had
she
struck
a
right
chord
at
last
have
you
bernie
she
said
gently
perhaps
if
we
tried
again
we
might
yet
win
out
not
the
presidency
that
s
settled
but
there
are
other
sorts
of
i
know
i
don
t
care
so
much
about
the
election
but
it
shows
that
nobody
likes
no
it
doesn
t
it
shows
that
you
re
very
nearly
as
popular
as
molly
mooney
for
there
was
only
a
majority
of
only
three
why
you
didn
t
tell
me
that
why
dotty
if
that
s
all
the
difference
there
was
in
the
count
it
s
almost
as
good
as
being
elected
only
yes
that
s
all
i
didn
t
know
you
d
care
what
the
count
was
if
you
didn
t
why
of
course
i
care
don
t
you
see
that
to
come
as
close
as
that
shows
that
lots
of
them
did
want
me
dotty
knew
it
didn
t
show
quite
this
but
still
it
was
an
indication
of
willingness
to
have
bernice
no
matter
for
what
reason
she
followed
up
the
advantage
then
bernice
if
you
realise
that
don
t
you
see
that
next
time
it
might
be
a
winning
vote
for
you
yes
it
encourages
me
to
keep
on
trying
oh
dotty
i
have
tried
i
mean
to
be
so
nice
and
gay
and
pleasant
that
they
would
like
i
believe
you
have
bernice
and
i
want
you
to
promise
me
to
keep
on
trying
now
see
here
give
dolly
and
me
another
chance
you
bargained
with
her
that
she
should
have
till
the
first
of
january
to
keep
her
part
of
the
bargain
now
here
you
re
turning
her
down
in
the
middle
of
december
that
s
so
that
isn
t
no
it
isn
t
and
you
re
always
fair
will
you
stick
to
your
own
bargain
and
give
her
till
the
first
of
the
new
year
of
course
i
will
you
tell
her
so
and
say
dotty
i
do
want
to
do
this
thing
right
you
know
i
want
to
be
liked
for
myself
not
because
dolly
s
booming
me
don
t
you
think
i
can
of
course
you
can
bernie
you
ve
only
to
be
your
own
self
nicest
self
you
know
not
give
way
to
those
airs
you
used
to
show
so
much
just
be
affable
and
willing
to
chum
and
people
will
like
you
fast
enough
now
i
must
run
i
want
to
tell
dolly
what
you
ve
said
before
she
cries
her
eyes
out
and
thank
you
lots
for
this
little
talk
ll
have
another
some
day
chapter
xx
the
carnival
queen
father
said
bernice
forbes
as
the
two
sat
at
dinner
that
night
are
you
a
popular
man
bless
my
soul
bernie
what
do
you
mean
just
that
dad
are
you
popular
among
your
friends
and
business
associates
well
that
s
a
leading
question
my
girl
and
i
m
not
sure
i
want
to
answer
it
for
to
tell
the
truth
daughter
i
m
not
so
very
popular
popularity
why
aren
t
you
and
bernice
looked
serious
why
are
you
asking
for
a
good
reason
daddy
please
tell
well
then
bernie
i
m
not
popular
because
i
m
not
willing
to
forget
myself
to
be
honest
i
m
a
man
of
decided
opinions
others
a
pretty
good
opinion
of
myself
that
sort
of
a
nature
doesn
t
command
admiration
from
the
don
t
you
care
father
not
much
i
feel
sometimes
as
if
i
d
like
to
be
more
chummy
with
my
men
friends
then
i
m
apt
to
say
something
to
provoke
them
and
they
rather
evade
dad
that
s
just
my
case
but
i
want
to
be
popular
in
school
i
mean
with
the
boys
and
girls
i
ve
never
been
a
no
well
you
can
be
easily
enough
if
you
how
simply
by
being
agreeable
always
and
by
agreeable
i
don
t
mean
plausibly
polite
i
mean
actually
to
with
people
with
what
they
say
and
what
they
whether
i
mean
it
or
not
pshaw
i
don
t
want
you
to
tell
falsehoods
of
course
but
if
some
one
says
i
just
adore
sunflowers
don
t
you
and
you
hate
them
you
needn
t
say
no
i
detest
the
horrid
things
but
you
can
say
they
re
such
a
brilliant
yellow
or
they
do
grow
very
tall
or
something
generally
acquiescent
instead
of
flatly
disagreeing
do
you
see
some
and
if
anybody
raves
over
a
girl
that
i
dislike
i
suppose
i
can
keep
my
mouth
more
than
that
you
can
surely
find
something
nice
to
say
about
the
girl
even
if
you
dislike
other
traits
she
yes
i
s
pose
i
could
and
if
the
girls
do
things
that
i
can
t
abide
i
spect
i
can
at
least
refrain
from
but
that
isn
t
enough
bernie
you
must
seem
to
them
unless
of
course
it
s
something
really
wrong
but
if
it
s
only
a
habit
or
a
mannerism
or
a
fashion
smile
at
it
and
agree
even
if
your
own
private
opinion
is
just
the
opposite
this
is
simple
tact
will
win
popularity
for
you
sooner
than
anything
there
s
something
in
what
you
say
father
i
ve
always
held
out
for
my
own
opinions
and
tastes
in
the
most
unimportant
matters
and
i
see
now
that
s
one
reason
why
they
call
me
and
forbes
smiled
i
remember
from
my
own
schooldays
those
are
the
most
awful
faults
a
child
can
have
i
advise
you
honey
to
quit
such
an
attitude
and
acquire
the
habit
of
agreeing
if
maisie
may
likes
blue
and
you
like
pink
say
the
blue
are
pretty
that
can
t
hurt
your
conscience
for
they
pretty
and
it
will
make
maisie
feel
far
more
friendly
than
if
you
deride
the
of
course
dad
your
example
is
a
silly
one
but
it
does
express
the
idea
i
ve
been
too
dictatorial
and
now
i
m
going
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
i
m
going
to
agree
with
in
trifles
bernie
don
t
go
so
far
as
to
misrepresent
yourself
in
any
matter
of
importance
or
any
question
of
right
or
wrong
if
any
one
tells
you
it
s
a
fine
day
you
needn
t
say
think
it
raw
and
disagreeable
but
if
any
one
says
it
s
a
fine
day
and
it
s
pouring
buckets
say
it
s
raining
and
stick
to
i
see
dad
and
bernice
laughed
i
ve
got
sense
enough
to
understand
what
you
mean
and
i
m
going
to
profit
by
it
is
this
the
sort
of
thing
you
don
t
do
i
m
afraid
it
is
girlie
i
have
a
naturally
contrary
disposition
and
if
any
one
says
anything
it
s
my
first
impulse
to
contradict
him
i
ve
tried
to
correct
this
but
i
m
too
old
a
dog
to
learn
new
tricks
but
you
re
young
and
you
ought
to
mend
your
ways
where
mending
is
needed
myself
think
you
re
perfect
just
as
you
are
and
forbes
smiled
fondly
at
his
pretty
daughter
dear
old
dad
but
i
might
be
a
better
girl
if
you
taught
me
more
about
behaviour
and
such
things
than
if
you
just
approve
of
can
t
do
it
honey
to
me
you
re
a
piece
of
perfection
apple
of
my
eye
and
all
i
ask
is
that
you
shall
be
happy
and
have
everything
you
want
is
there
anything
i
can
give
you
dearie
that
you
don
t
possess
no
you
dear
old
father
but
some
day
soon
perhaps
i
may
ask
a
favour
of
you
a
strange
one
all
right
it
s
granted
in
advance
to
the
half
of
my
kingdom
then
the
other
half
bernice
was
right
it
would
have
been
far
better
if
forbes
had
exercised
a
kind
supervision
over
his
daughter
and
her
ways
instead
of
giving
her
this
unquestioning
approbation
but
such
was
his
nature
and
the
motherless
girl
suffered
in
consequence
however
bernice
took
to
heart
her
father
s
talk
about
being
agreeable
and
began
at
once
to
put
it
in
practice
she
was
astonished
to
find
how
easy
it
was
often
she
stifled
an
impulse
to
contradict
and
discovered
that
she
could
honestly
agree
just
as
well
but
it
was
slow
work
nobody
seemed
ready
to
meet
her
even
the
two
d
s
had
become
disheartened
for
the
girls
and
boys
tired
of
showing
bernice
attention
just
because
dolly
and
dotty
asked
them
to
and
about
a
week
before
the
christmas
holidays
fayre
told
his
family
that
they
might
as
well
begin
to
pack
up
nothing
more
will
be
said
until
after
january
first
he
remarked
but
there
seems
no
hope
of
a
change
of
plans
you
know
what
forbes
is
i
d
rather
not
speak
to
him
on
the
subject
and
get
snubbed
for
my
but
you
might
just
ask
him
father
said
trudy
i
hate
to
resign
from
my
club
and
give
up
my
place
on
the
concert
committee
unless
we
re
surely
going
you
may
as
well
give
them
up
trudy
answered
her
father
for
we
re
sure
to
when
asked
dolly
with
a
quivering
lip
about
the
middle
of
january
dear
i
m
very
sorry
for
you
dolly
girlie
but
you
can
have
dotty
to
visit
you
a
lot
and
you
can
visit
and
treasure
house
said
dolly
in
a
broken
voice
that
we
ll
turn
over
to
dotty
we
can
t
very
well
take
it
with
oh
daddy
it
will
me
and
dolly
flung
herself
into
her
father
s
arms
in
a
paroxysm
of
weeping
there
there
dear
little
girl
it
terribly
hard
i
know
but
try
to
bear
it
my
darling
little
daughter
i
ll
do
anything
i
can
for
you
to
make
up
perhaps
you
can
have
another
treasure
house
in
buffalo
but
not
unless
we
re
fairly
sure
of
staying
there
oh
i
don
t
another
treasure
house
nor
another
dotty
i
just
want
house
and
dotty
oh
i
can
t
it
it
was
a
long
time
before
they
could
quiet
the
nervous
and
heartbroken
child
at
last
quite
worn
out
she
went
to
bed
but
not
to
sleep
she
lay
there
thinking
it
i
must
manage
it
somehow
she
kept
saying
to
herself
there
s
bernice
she
could
keep
us
here
by
a
single
word
to
her
father
and
she
won
t
do
it
i
ve
done
all
i
possibly
can
to
make
her
popular
what
more
could
i
do
it
seems
so
silly
to
have
my
whole
life
s
happiness
hang
on
the
word
of
that
girl
but
if
it
does
hang
there
why
i
pick
it
off
why
oh
tossing
and
tumbling
in
her
little
white
bed
dolly
put
in
an
awful
night
at
last
one
little
forlorn
hope
came
to
her
if
i
can
do
that
she
thought
seeing
a
tiny
ray
of
hope
bernice
will
surely
agree
that
i
have
kept
my
part
of
the
she
thought
and
thought
she
planned
and
planned
at
last
though
it
was
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
she
jumped
out
of
bed
and
throwing
on
her
sat
at
her
desk
and
wrote
a
long
letter
to
bert
and
another
to
bob
rose
then
she
went
back
to
bed
and
after
a
short
time
sleep
came
to
ease
the
poor
little
worried
mind
the
days
flew
by
the
cold
weather
continued
and
skating
was
the
delight
of
all
the
young
people
bernice
was
a
fine
skater
and
close
watch
on
the
part
of
dolly
and
dotty
showed
that
she
had
partners
for
the
skating
parties
far
oftener
than
she
used
to
this
favoured
dolly
s
new
plan
the
same
being
nothing
more
nor
less
than
to
have
bernice
chosen
queen
of
the
carnival
which
on
christmas
eve
was
to
be
the
great
celebration
of
the
holiday
season
a
skating
carnival
had
not
been
possible
for
many
years
but
the
exceptionally
cold
winter
had
made
it
feasible
this
season
and
all
the
young
people
of
berwick
were
wildly
enthusiastic
over
it
tad
and
tod
brown
were
willing
this
time
to
consent
to
the
request
of
the
two
d
s
to
vote
for
bernice
as
carnival
queen
she
s
a
skater
said
tad
the
best
in
berwick
i
think
and
another
thing
bernie
is
a
heap
nicer
than
she
used
to
be
she
s
come
down
off
her
high
horse
and
almost
never
rubs
in
her
wealth
and
she
nicer
agreed
tod
she
doesn
t
snap
a
fellow
up
everything
he
says
and
she
smiles
more
all
this
was
as
balm
to
dolly
s
soul
she
rejoiced
to
hear
the
boys
speak
thus
of
bernice
then
she
had
cold
chills
lest
since
bernice
was
winning
praise
by
her
own
improvement
she
might
conclude
that
dolly
had
no
hand
in
it
and
therefore
had
not
won
her
promised
reward
but
the
two
indefatigable
workers
kept
on
they
were
more
wary
than
they
had
been
when
trying
to
get
bernice
made
class
president
for
in
this
instance
many
were
concerned
beside
their
class
in
high
school
so
they
worked
quietly
even
secretly
but
they
urged
many
to
vote
for
bernice
as
queen
of
the
carnival
and
partly
owing
to
the
position
and
influence
of
forbes
many
expressed
themselves
as
more
than
willing
to
consent
the
hopes
of
the
two
d
s
ran
high
dolly
s
letters
to
the
two
boys
had
resulted
in
their
influencing
a
number
of
boys
in
berwick
whom
the
girls
did
not
know
well
enough
to
speak
to
about
it
and
so
when
the
question
came
up
before
the
committee
public
spirit
was
so
much
in
favour
of
bernice
that
she
was
chosen
queen
by
a
large
majority
oh
sighed
dolly
in
absolute
content
when
she
heard
of
it
i
so
glad
is
it
really
true
dotty
we
ve
won
something
anyway
i
don
t
know
whether
bernie
will
feel
that
did
anything
to
help
but
i
did
you
bet
you
did
cried
dotty
and
i
ll
see
to
it
that
bernice
be
careful
know
she
hates
to
owe
it
to
my
but
that
was
her
i
know
but
still
she
squirms
when
she
thinks
i
just
plain
coax
people
to
be
nice
to
i
should
think
she
would
isn
t
it
horrid
doll
to
win
favour
that
way
of
course
it
seems
so
to
us
but
you
know
how
bernie
is
i
suppose
dot
if
she
had
a
mother
like
the
rest
of
us
have
she
d
be
i
s
pose
the
night
of
the
carnival
came
a
perfect
night
clear
cold
and
illuminated
by
a
kindly
moon
which
was
somewhat
eclipsed
by
the
lights
that
surrounded
and
glorified
the
little
berwick
lake
the
decorations
were
elaborate
and
the
committee
in
charge
were
justly
proud
of
their
display
bob
and
bert
were
home
for
their
holiday
and
were
eager
to
know
the
result
of
the
campaign
fine
declared
dolly
bernie
was
chosen
by
a
big
majority
and
she
ll
be
a
stunning
queen
she
s
going
to
wear
white
velvet
and
ermine
ermine
won
t
she
be
beautiful
she
was
beautiful
the
costume
though
magnificent
was
none
too
grand
for
a
carnival
queen
and
better
than
that
the
face
under
the
crown
of
gold
filigree
tipped
with
white
ostrich
feathers
was
sweet
and
smiling
and
showed
only
kindly
and
merry
impulses
dolly
as
she
herself
dressed
for
the
carnival
was
distinctly
nervous
and
apprehensive
bernice
had
been
so
busy
getting
ready
for
the
event
and
attending
to
its
details
that
dolly
hadn
t
seen
her
alone
for
weeks
she
couldn
t
say
exactly
that
bernice
had
avoided
her
but
they
had
not
been
thrown
together
and
dolly
had
no
idea
whether
bernice
intended
to
carry
out
her
part
of
the
contract
or
not
she
feared
and
it
was
with
a
heavy
heart
that
she
donned
her
pretty
skating
costume
it
was
of
light
blue
cloth
banded
with
silver
fox
a
cap
to
match
sat
jauntily
on
the
golden
curls
and
it
was
a
lovely
reflection
that
looked
back
at
her
from
her
mirror
but
dolly
cared
little
for
her
own
appearance
so
unnerved
was
she
over
the
uncertainty
that
still
hung
over
her
meantime
dotty
next
door
was
also
dressing
for
the
carnival
her
costume
was
of
red
broadcloth
with
dark
fur
trimmings
it
was
of
russian
effect
and
suited
well
the
rosy
beauty
of
the
girl
she
too
was
thoughtful
at
last
she
exclaimed
i
can
t
it
and
throwing
aside
the
cap
she
was
about
to
don
she
flew
down
to
the
library
and
snatched
up
the
telephone
bernice
she
said
after
she
got
the
connection
i
ask
you
are
you
going
to
ask
your
father
know
what
what
asked
bernice
so
full
of
her
own
affairs
she
really
didn
t
think
what
dotty
had
in
mind
you
know
s
staying
in
berwick
instead
of
going
oh
that
well
i
can
t
bother
about
it
now
yes

but
i

t

a

or

goodness

and
just
then
it
struck
bernice
that
she
was
to
agree
with
people
all
right
dotsie
she
said
with
such
a
sudden
change
of
intonation
that
dotty
nearly
fell
off
her
chair
i
ll
go
right
now
you
hang
up
and
i
ll
call
you
in
a
few
honest
yes

and
dotty
waited
in
a
short
time
the
telephone
hell
rang
and
bernice
said
it
s
all
right

says
he
can
arrange
it

easy
as

t

tell
dolly
no
let
me

all

rather
you
would
i
m
fearfully
busy
bernice
was
evidently
preoccupied
with
her
preparations
but
dotty
didn
t
care
now
they
had
won
forbes
had
given
his
word
and
all
was
well
flinging
on
her
cap
that
was
part
of
her
costume
dotty
flew
over
to
dolly
s
like
a
small
but
very
energetic
whirlwind
up
the
stairs
she
bounded
and
into
dolly
s
room
she
grabbed
her
round
the
neck
and
kissed
her
frantically
while
she
cried
it
s
all
right
we
ve
won
forbes
says

can
stay
what
and
dolly
s
blue
eyes
opened
wide
in
glad
surprise
bert
and
trudy
heard
the
commotion
and
came
from
their
rooms
yes
dotty
whispered
still
holding
dolly
tight
it
s
all
right
i
tell
you

trudy

the
two

got
a
bert
led
trudy
away
and
laughingly
put
her
back
in
her
own
room
then
he
went
to
dolly
s
door
all
right
dot
honestly
yes
yes
oh

t
it

and
then
dotty
told
of
her
telephone

how

agreed
to

the
new

bewildered

in
the
house

made
a
clean
breast
of
the
whole
