foreword
let
a
child
open
the
covers
of
this
book
and
straightway
he
is
in
that
land
of
all
delights
fairy
realm
here
fairy
godmothers
reward
good
children
and
punish
bad
ones
here
little
men
yield
up
their
treasures
of
gold
and
magic
gifts
while
pixies
drop
silver
pennies
in
and
merry
spriggans
and
fays
hold
nightly
revels
in
the
moonlight
here
too
a
child
may
dance
in
fairy
rings
or
hie
away
to
elfinland
for
a
year
and
a
day
to
play
with
pick
fairy
flowers
listen
to
fairy
birds
and
be
fed
on
magic
goodies
old
favourites
like
cinderella
toads
and
diamonds
and
robin
goodfellow
may
charm
the
little
reader
or
other
delightful
tales
new
to
most
children
such
as
butterfly
s
diamond
and
timothy
tuttle
and
the
little
imps
will
fascinate
as
much
as
do
the
older
tales
stories
are
here
from
all
lands
where
fairies
thrive
legends
myths
and
from
china
japan
the
south
seas
england
ireland
wales
cornwall
and
red
indian
land
and
from
many
other
spots
and
every
story
is
about
fairies
black
grey
green
and
white
and
every
one
has
been
selected
for
delightful
humour
fancy
or
ethical
teaching
nearly
all
have
been
retold
to
meet
the
needs
of
and
to
please
the
children
as
far
as
possible
the
language
of
the
originals
has
been
retained
and
elements
that
will
terrify
little
children
or
teach
them
that
wrong
is
right
have
been
eliminated
the
french
tales
all
but
one
have
been
freshly
translated
a
subject
index
is
appended
to
aid
the
storyteller
in
choosing
stories
dealing
with
specific
subjects
such
as
fruits
flowers
seasons
holidays
trees
also
with
moral
qualities
like
obedience
thrift
honesty
and
to
impart
true
fairy
spirit
as
well
as
literary
flavour
many
famous
fairy
poems
by
shakespeare
ben
jonson
michael
drayton
and
other
poets
are
included
so
that
the
volume
forms
a
collection
of
the
best
fairy
literature
not
merely
planned
to
give
the
children
joy
but
to
be
of
real
educational
value
but
of
what
possible
educational
value
are
fairy
tales
asks
the
practical
parent
or
teacher
they
are
essential
in
the
right
development
of
a
child
s
mind
they
embody
the
poetic
fancy
of
the
race
they
stimulate
a
child
s
imagination
feed
his
fancy
and
satisfy
poetically
his
groping
after
things
unseen
his
craving
for
such
tales
is
due
to
a
normal
growth
of
mind
if
he
be
deprived
of
fairy
tales
in
childhood
he
is
likely
as
an
adult
to
lack
the
creative
imagination
which
makes
men
and
women
and
leads
to
success
in
literature
art
invention
or
in
the
practical
things
of
business
life
there
are
of
course
children
who
do
not
like
fairy
tales
but
they
are
few
and
far
between
and
other
forms
of
literature
may
be
found
which
will
in
part
help
to
develop
their
peculiar
type
of
mentality
but
fairy
tales
are
the
heritage
of
the
normal
child
and
if
he
be
judiciously
fed
on
them
in
later
life
he
will
have
a
more
plastic
imagination
and
be
able
to
enjoy
more
fully
the
beauties
of
great
poetry
and
other
fine
literature
robert
burns
said
in
a
letter
to
moore
that
in
his
infant
and
boyish
days
he
owed
much
to
an
old
woman
who
lived
in
his
family
for
her
tales
of
brownies
and
fairies
and
other
wonders
cultivated
the
latent
seeds
of
poetry
in
the
poet
s
mind
and
even
the
grave
luther
said
i
would
not
for
any
quantity
of
gold
part
with
the
wonderful
tales
which
i
have
retained
from
my
earliest
childhood
or
have
met
with
in
my
progress
through
charles
lamb
and
coleridge
too
believed
heartily
in
fairy
tales
ought
children
to
be
permitted
to
read
romances
and
stories
of
giants
magicians
and
genii
asked
coleridge
i
know
all
that
has
been
said
against
it
but
i
have
formed
my
faith
in
the
affirmative
i
know
no
other
way
of
giving
the
mind
a
love
of
the
great
and
the
whole
i
read
every
book
that
came
in
my
way
without
distinction
and
my
father
was
fond
of
me
and
used
to
take
me
on
his
knee
and
hold
long
conversations
with
me
i
remember
when
eight
years
old
walking
with
him
one
winter
evening
and
he
then
told
me
the
names
of
the
stars
and
how
jupiter
was
a
thousand
times
larger
than
our
world
and
that
the
other
twinkling
stars
were
suns
that
had
worlds
rolling
round
them
and
when
i
came
home
he
showed
me
how
they
rolled
round
i
heard
him
with
a
profound
delight
and
admiration
but
without
the
least
mixture
of
wonder
or
incredulity
for
from
my
early
reading
of
fairy
tales
and
about
genii
and
the
like
my
mind
had
been
habituated
to
and
i
never
regarded
in
any
way
as
the
of
my
such
then
is
the
educational
mission
of
the
fairy
tale
not
only
to
give
pure
joy
but
to
enlarge
the
mind
and
as
childhood
is
the
only
time
when
this
miracle
takes
place
in
its
completeness
every
child
who
so
desires
should
be
allowed
to
wander
at
will
in
the
land
of
imaginative
delights
where
the
king
of
fairy
poets
shakespeare
loved
to
wander
as
a
child
and
as
a
man
in
the
plea
of
the
midsummer
fairies
that
benign
shape

would

adventures
of
robin
goodfellow
merry
how
robin
goodfellow
was
born
once
upon
a
time
when
men
did
eat
more
and
drink
less
when
men
did
know
no
knavery
there
were
wont
to
walk
many
harmless
sprites
called
fairies
dancing
in
brave
order
in
fairy
rings
on
green
hills
to
sweet
music
these
sprites
would
make
themselves
invisible
and
many
mad
pranks
would
they
play
pinching
careless
housemaids
black
and
blue
and
turning
houses
but
lovingly
they
would
use
neat
housemaids
giving
them
silver
and
other
pretty
toys
which
they
left
in
the
maids
shoes
and
pockets
or
in
bright
kitchen
pans
now
in
those
fairy
days
there
was
born
on
earth
a
tiny
elfin
boy
whom
folk
called
robin
goodfellow
and
wonderful
were
the
gifts
from
fairyland
that
came
to
robin
when
he
was
a
baby
in
his
room
suddenly
would
appear
rich
embroidered
cushions
delicate
linen
garments
and
all
sorts
of
delicious
things
to
eat
and
drink
so
he
was
never
in
want
now
when
robin
was
grown
to
six
years
he
was
so
mischievous
that
the
neighbours
all
complained
of
his
pranks
until
he
was
forced
to
run
away
he
wandered
about
until
he
began
to
get
hungry
then
going
to
a
tailor
he
took
service
with
him
he
remained
there
until
he
grew
so
mischievous
that
he
was
obliged
to
run
away
again
how
he
received
a
message
from
fairyland
after
he
had
travelled
a
good
day
s
journey
from
the
tailor
s
house
he
sat
down
by
the
wayside
and
being
weary
fell
asleep
no
sooner
had
he
closed
his
eyes
than
he
fancied
he
saw
tiny
beings
tripping
on
the
grass
before
him
to
the
sound
of
sweet
music
and
when
he
awoke
he
found
to
his
surprise
a
scroll
lying
near
by
on
which
were
these
verses
written
in
letters
of
gold
my
only
son
and
heir
for
food
and
drink
take
thou
no
care
wish
what
thou
wilt
and
thou
shalt
have
the
power
to
tease
both
fool
and
knave
change
when
thou
wilt
thine
elfish
shape
to
horse
or
hog
or
dog
or
ape
and
scare
each
idle
dirty
maid
and
make
all
wicked
men
afraid
but
love
thou
those
that
honest
be
and
help
them
in
thus
and
all
the
world
shall
know
the
pranks
of
robin
goodfellow
if
thou
lt
observe
my
just
command
one
day
thou
shalt
see
robin
having
read
this
was
very
joyful
for
he
perceived
that
he
had
fairy
power
he
straightway
wished
for
something
to
eat
and
it
appeared
before
him
then
he
wished
himself
a
horse
and
no
sooner
did
he
say
so
than
he
became
a
handsome
colt
curveting
and
leaping
about
he
wished
himself
a
dog
and
was
one
after
that
he
turned
himself
into
any
shape
he
liked
then
taking
his
own
form
again
he
once
more
started
on
his
travels
of
his
mad
pranks
ho
ho
ho
and
from
that
time
forward
many
were
the
merry
tricks
robin
played
on
those
he
met
once
seeing
a
rude
and
clownish
fellow
searching
for
a
lost
horse
robin
turned
himself
into
a
horse
and
led
the
rude
man
a
chase
over
field
and
briar
until
he
allowed
the
man
to
catch
him
and
mount
his
back
then
robin
jumped
into
a
stream
and
turning
into
a
fish
swam
to
the
shore
and
ran
away
laughing
ho
ho
ho
leaving
the
man
to
get
out
of
the
water
as
best
he
could
at
night
robin
often
visited
farmers
houses
and
helped
the
neat
housemaids
with
their
work
breaking
their
hemp
dressing
their
flax
and
spinning
their
yarn
one
night
he
came
to
a
house
where
there
was
a
good
and
handsome
maid
and
while
she
slept
robin
did
her
work
more
than
she
could
have
done
in
twelve
hours
the
maid
wondered
the
next
morning
to
see
all
done
so
finely
and
that
night
she
watched
to
see
what
would
follow
at
twelve
of
the
clock
in
came
robin
and
singing
fell
to
work
breaking
her
hemp
and
doing
her
spinning
and
as
he
worked
he
sang
a
mad
song
and
out
in
and
out
round
as
a
ball
with
hither
and
thither
as
straight
as
a
line
with
lily
and
germander
and
sops
of
wine
with
sweetbriar
and
bonfire
and
strawberry
wire
and
columbine
the
maid
seeing
that
he
had
no
clothes
pitied
him
and
the
next
night
she
laid
out
a
little
suit
that
she
had
cut
and
sewed
during
the
day
robin
coming
in
spied
the
clothes
whereat
he
started
and
said
tis
not
your
garments
new
or
old
that
robin
loves
i
feel
no
cold
had
you
left
me
milk
or
cream

should
have
had
a
pleasant
dream

drop
or
crumb
robin
never
more
will
and
with
that
he
ran
out
of
the
door
laughing
loudly
ho
ho
ho
and
many
other
mad
pranks
did
robin
goodfellow
play
at
times
he
turned
himself
into
a
misleading
lovers
who
came
over
the
heath
at
other
times
he
punished
knaves
and
idle
maids
or
rewarded
good
and
worthy
people
and
always
he
ran
laughing
ho
ho

how
he
danced
in
the
fairy
ring
at
length
oberon
king
of
fairyland
seeing
so
many
honest
and
merry
tricks
called
one
night
to
robin
as
he
lay
sleeping
in
the
my

now
my
roguish
son

time

sports

robin
hearing
this
woke
and
rose
hastily
and
looking
about
saw
in
the
moonlight
king
oberon
and
many
fairies
with
him
dressed
in
green
silk
and
all
these
did
welcome
robin
goodfellow
into
their
company
king
oberon
took
robin
by
the
hand
and
led
him
a
dance
and
near
by
sat
little
tom
thumb
the
fairy
piper
no
bigger
than
a
plum
his
bagpipe
was
made
of
a
wren
s
quill
and
the
skin
of
a
tiny
bug
this
pipe
made
music
so
shrill
and
sweet
that
naught
might
be
compared
to
it
then
all
the
fairies
for
joy
did
circle
robin
around
and
in
a
ring
did
dance
about
him
and
robin
goodfellow
danced
in
the
midst
of
them
and
sang
this
song
and
nimble
quick
and
nimble

about
little

thus
they
danced
for
a
good
space
then
sat
themselves
down
upon
the
grass
and
the
fairies
told
robin
of
many
elfish
tricks
and
merry
capers
until
the
time
passing
a
shepherd
in
a
field
near
by
blew
his
pipes
so
loudly
that
he
frightened
little
tom
thumb
the
fairies
punished
the
shepherd
by
the
loss
of
his
pipes
so
that
they
presently
broke
in
his
hand
to
his
great
amazement
hereat
robin
goodfellow
laughed
ho
ho
ho
the
morning
being
come
at
the
fairies
hastened
away
to
fairyland
where
i
think
they
yet
remain
the
potato
supper
some
folk
say
that
the
little
people
the
fairies
were
once
angels
that
were
cast
out
of
heaven
for
their
sins
they
fell
to
earth
and
grew
smaller
and
smaller
and
they
dance
on
moonlit
nights
in
fairy
rings
and
play
all
manner
of
pranks
be
that
as
it
may
one
night
a
merry
troop
of
them
was
capering
in
the
moonshine
on
a
nice
green
sward
by
a
river
s
bank
the
little
fellows
were
dancing
with
their
red
caps
wagging
at
every
bound
and
so
light
were
their
feet
that
the
dew
trembled
but
was
not
disturbed
so
they
danced
spinning
around
and
around
and
twirling
and
bobbing
and
diving
until
one
of
them
chirped
cease
with
your
humming
here
s
an
end
to
your
mumming
by
my
smell
i
can
tell
that
a
priest
is
now
coming
and
away
all
the
fairies
scampered
as
fast
as
they
could
some
hid
under
the
green
leaves
of
the
foxglove
their
little
caps
peeping
out
like
crimson
bells
others
crept
under
the
shadow
of
stones
or
beneath
the
bank
of
the
river
and
scarcely
had
they
done
so
when
along
came
father
horrigan
riding
slowly
on
his
pony
he
was
thinking
to
himself
that
he
would
end
his
journey
at
the
first
cabin
he
came
to
and
so
he
did
for
soon
he
stopped
at
the
little
house
of
dermod
leary
and
lifting
the
latch
walked
in
with
a
blessing
on
all
here
and
a
welcome
guest
you
may
be
sure
was
father
horrigan
for
no
man
was
better
loved
in
all
that
country
but
when
dermod
saw
him
enter
he
was
troubled
for
he
had
nothing
to
offer
for
supper
except
some
potatoes
that
his
wife
was
boiling
in
a
pot
over
the
fire
then
he
remembered
that
he
had
set
a
net
in
the
river
there
ll
be
no
harm
thought
he
in
my
stepping
down
to
see
if
anything
has
been
so
down
to
the
river
went
dermod
he
found
as
fine
a
salmon
in
the
net
as
ever
jumped
from
water
but
as
he
was
taking
it
out
the
net
was
jerked
from
his
hands
and
away
the
salmon
went
swimming
along
as
though
nothing
had
happened
dermod
looked
sorrowfully
at
the
wake
that
the
fish
left
shining
like
a
line
of
silver
in
the
moonlight
may
bitter
luck
attend
you
night
and
day
cried
he
shaking
his
fist
some
evil
thing
sure
it
was
that
helped
you
for
did
i
not
feel
it
pull
the
net
out
of
my
hand
you
re
all
wrong
dermod
there
were
a
hundred
or
more
of
us
pulling
against
you
squeaked
a
little
voice
near
his
feet
and
the
whole
troop
of
fairies
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
them
came
rushing
from
their
and
stood
before
him
their
red
caps
nodding
violently
dermod
gazed
at
them
in
wonder
then
one
of
the
fairies
said
make
yourself
noways
uneasy
about
the
priest
s
supper
dermod
leary
if
you
will
go
back
and
ask
him
one
question
for
us
there
ll
be
as
fine
a
supper
spread
before
him
in
no
time
as
ever
was
put
on
i
ll
have
nothing
to
do
with
you
at
all
at
all
answered
dermod
i
know
better
than
to
sell
my
soul
to
the
likes
of
you
but
the
little
fairy
was
not
to
be
repulsed
will
you
ask
the
priest
just
one
civil
question
for
us
dermod
said
he
dermod
considered
for
a
moment
i
see
no
objection
said
he
to
the
same
but
i
ll
have
nothing
to
do
with
your
supper
mind
that
the
little
people
all
crowded
near
him
while
the
fairy
answered
go
and
ask
father
horrigan
to
tell
us
whether
our
souls
will
be
saved
at
the
last
day
and
if
you
wish
us
well
dermod
leary
you
will
bring
the
word
that
he
away
went
dermod
to
his
cabin
please
your
reverence
said
he
to
father
horrigan
may
i
make
bold
to
ask
your
honour
a
question
what
is
it
said
father
horrigan
why
then
said
dermod
will
the
souls
of
the
little
people
be
saved
at
the
last
day
who
bids
you
ask
that
question
leary
said
father
horrigan
fixing
his
eyes
sternly
on
dermod
i
ll
tell
no
lies
about
the
matter
nothing
in
life
but
the
truth
answered
dermod
twas
the
little
people
themselves
who
sent
me
they
are
in
thousands
down
on
the
bank
of
the
river
waiting
for
your
go
back
said
father
horrigan
and
tell
them
that
if
they
want
to
know
they
must
come
here
to
me
themselves
and
i
ll
answer
that
and
any
other
so
back
dermod
hurried
to
the
river
the
fairies
came
swarming
around
him
they
pressed
close
to
his
feet
with
faces
upturned
as
they
anxiously
waited
and
dermod
brave
man
that
he
was
spoke
out
boldly
and
gave
them
the
priest
s
message
and
when
they
heard
that
the
whole
multitude
of
little
fairies
uttered
shrill
cries
and
groans
and
they
whisked
past
dermod
in
such
numbers
that
he
was
quite
bewildered
then
in
a
trice
he
found
himself
alone
illustration
dermod
gazed
at
them
in
wonder
he
went
slowly
back
to
his
cabin
he
opened
the
door
the
fire
was
burning
brightly
the
candles
were
lighted
and
good
father
horrigan
was
seated
comfortably
at
the
table
a
pitcher
of
new
milk
before
him
and
a
bit
of
fresh
butter
from
dermod
s
cow
and
dermod
s
wife
was
handing
him
a
big
handsome
potato
whose
white
mealy
insides
were
bursting
through
its
skin
and
smoking
like
a
horse
on
a
frosty
night
dermod
sat
down
at
the
table
and
began
to
eat
without
a
word
and
when
father
horrigan
was
through
the
good
priest
smacked
his
lips
and
said
that
he
had
relished
the
hot
tasty
potatoes
more
than
a
dozen
fat
salmon
and
a
whole
fairy
feast
the
calf
and
the
fairy
ring
in
tipperary
is
one
of
the
most
singularly
shaped
hills
in
the
world
it
has
a
peak
at
the
top
like
a
conical
nightcap
on
this
very
peak
long
years
ago
a
herdsman
spent
his
nights
and
days
watching
the
herd
now
the
hill
was
ancient
fairy
ground
and
the
little
people
were
angry
that
the
scene
of
their
light
and
airy
gambols
should
be
trampled
by
the
rude
hoofs
of
bulls
and
cows
the
lowing
of
the
cattle
sounded
sad
in
their
ears
so
the
queen
of
the
fairies
determined
to
drive
away
the
herdsman
one
night
the
moon
shone
brightly
on
the
hill
the
cattle
were
lying
down
the
herdsman
wrapped
in
his
mantle
was
watching
the
twinkling
stars
when
suddenly
there
appeared
before
him
a
great
horse
with
the
wings
of
an
eagle
and
the
tail
of
a
dragon
this
beast
hissed
loudly
and
spat
fire
and
while
the
herdsman
was
looking
on
half
dead
with
fright
it
turned
into
a
little
old
man
lame
of
leg
with
a
bull
s
head
around
which
flames
were
playing
the
next
moment
the
little
old
man
changed
into
a
huge
ape
with
duck
s
feet
and
a
s
tail
and
then
the
queen
of
the
fairies
for
of
course
it
was
she
roared
neighed
hissed
bellowed
howled
and
hooted
so
fearfully
that
the
poor
herdsman
in
terror
covered
his
head
with
his
mantle
but
it
was
of
no
use
for
with
one
puff
of
wind
she
blew
away
the
fold
of
his
mantle
let
him
hold
it
never
so
tightly
as
for
the
poor
man
he
could
not
stir
or
close
his
eyes
but
was
forced
to
sit
there
gazing
at
this
terrible
sight
until
his
hair
lifted
his
hat
half
a
foot
from
his
head
and
his
teeth
chattered
so
that
they
almost
fell
out
of
his
mouth
meanwhile
the
frightened
cattle
scampered
about
like
mad
as
if
bitten
by
fleas
and
so
they
continued
to
do
until
the
sun
rose
then
the
fairy
queen
disappeared
night
after
night
the
same
thing
happened
and
the
cattle
went
mad
some
fell
into
pits
or
tumbled
into
the
river
and
were
drowned
by
and
by
not
a
herdsman
was
willing
to
tend
the
cattle
at
night
the
farmer
who
owned
the
hill
offered
triple
and
quadruple
wages
but
not
a
man
was
found
who
would
face
the
terrors
of
the
fairy
ring
the
herd
gradually
thinned
and
the
fairies
on
moonlit
nights
danced
and
gambolled
as
merrily
as
before
sipping
from
and
spreading
their
feasts
on
the
heads
of
mushrooms
now
there
dwelt
in
that
part
of
the
country
a
man
named
larry
hoolahan
who
played
on
the
pipes
better
than
any
other
player
within
fifteen
parishes
a
dashing
roving
blade
was
larry
and
afraid
of
nothing
one
day
the
farmer
met
him
and
told
him
all
his
misfortunes
if
that
is
what
ails
you
said
larry
make
your
mind
easy
were
there
as
many
fairies
on
the
hill
as
there
are
in
tipperary
i
would
face
them
it
would
be
a
queer
thing
indeed
if
i
who
was
never
afraid
of
a
proper
man
should
turn
my
back
on
a
fairy
not
the
bigness
of
one
s
thumb
larry
said
the
farmer
do
not
talk
so
bold
for
you
know
not
who
is
hearing
you
but
if
you
make
your
words
good
and
watch
my
herds
for
a
week
on
top
of
the
hill
your
hand
shall
be
free
of
my
dish
till
the
sun
has
burnt
itself
down
to
the
bigness
of
a
farthing
rushlight
the
bargain
was
struck
and
larry
went
to
the
when
the
moon
was
beginning
to
peep
over
its
brow
he
took
his
seat
on
a
big
stone
under
a
hollow
of
the
hill
with
his
back
to
the
wind
and
pulled
out
his
pipes
he
had
not
played
long
when
the
voices
of
the
fairies
were
heard
upon
the
blast
like
a
low
stream
of
music
presently
they
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
and
larry
could
plainly
hear
one
say
what
another
man
upon
the
fairies
ring
go
to
him
queen
and
make
him
repent
of
his
rashness
and
away
they
flew
and
larry
felt
them
pass
by
his
face
like
a
swarm
of
midges
looking
up
hastily
he
saw
between
the
moon
and
him
a
great
black
cat
standing
on
the
very
tip
of
its
claws
with
its
back
up
and
mewing
with
a
voice
like
a
presently
it
swelled
up
toward
the
sky
and
turning
round
on
its
left
hind
leg
whirled
till
it
fell
to
the
ground
then
it
started
up
in
the
shape
of
a
salmon
with
a
cravat
round
its
neck
and
wearing
a
pair
of
new
go
on
my
jewel
said
larry
if
you
dance
i
ll
pipe
and
he
struck
up
but
the
queen
of
the
fairies
for
of
course
it
was
she
turned
into
this
and
that
and
the
other
but
still
larry
played
on
as
well
as
he
knew
how
at
last
she
lost
patience
and
changed
herself
into
a
calf
as
the
cream
of
cork
and
with
eyes
as
mild
as
those
of
a
loving
girl
she
came
up
gentle
and
fawning
hoping
to
throw
him
off
his
guard
and
then
to
work
him
some
wrong
but
larry
was
not
so
deceived
for
when
she
came
near
dropping
his
pipes
he
leaped
on
her
back
now
from
the
top
of
the
hill
as
you
look
westward
you
may
see
the
broad
river
shannon
full
ten
miles
away
on
this
night
its
waters
shone
beautifully
under
the
moon
and
no
sooner
had
larry
leaped
on
the
back
of
the
fairy
queen
than
she
sprang
from
the
and
bounded
clear
at
one
jump
over
the
shannon
it
was
done
in
a
second
and
when
she
alighted
on
the
distant
bank
she
kicked
up
her
heels
and
flung
larry
on
the
soft
turf
no
sooner
was
larry
thus
planted
than
he
looked
her
straight
in
the
face
and
cried
out
by
my
word
well
done
that
was
not
a
bad
leap
a
she
gazed
at
him
for
a
moment
and
then
assuming
her
own
shape
said
larry
hoolahan
you
are
a
bold
fellow
will
you
go
back
the
way
you
came
and
that
s
what
i
will
said
he
if
you
ll
let
me
so
she
changed
to
a
calf
again
and
larry
got
on
her
back
at
another
bound
they
were
standing
inside
the
fairy
ring
then
the
queen
once
more
assuming
her
own
shape
addressed
him
you
have
shown
so
much
courage
larry
hoolahan
said
she
that
while
you
keep
herds
on
this
hill
you
shall
not
be
molested
by
me
or
mine
the
day
dawns
go
down
to
the
farmer
and
tell
him
this
and
if
anything
i
can
do
will
be
of
service
to
you
ask
and
you
shall
have
she
vanished
accordingly
and
kept
her
word
in
never
visiting
the
hill
during
larry
s
lifetime
but
he
never
troubled
her
with
requests
he
piped
and
ate
and
drank
at
the
farmer
s
expense
and
roosted
in
the
occasionally
casting
an
eye
on
the
herd
he
died
at
last
and
is
buried
in
a
green
valley
of
pleasant
tipperary
but
whether
the
fairies
returned
to
the
hill
after
his
death
is
more
than
i
can
say
the
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
little
girl
named
betty
her
mother
was
a
widow
and
very
poor
and
owned
only
a
house
and
two
goats
nevertheless
betty
was
always
cheerful
from
spring
to
autumn
she
pastured
the
goats
in
the
birch
wood
every
morning
when
she
left
home
her
mother
gave
her
a
little
basket
in
which
were
a
slice
of
bread
and
a
spindle
my
child
she
said
work
hard
and
fill
the
spindle
before
you
and
as
betty
had
no
distaff
she
wound
the
flax
around
her
head
took
the
basket
and
with
a
skip
and
a
jump
led
her
goats
to
the
birch
wood
there
she
sat
under
a
tree
and
drew
fibres
of
the
flax
from
her
head
with
her
left
hand
and
let
down
the
spindle
with
her
right
so
that
it
just
hummed
over
the
ground
and
all
the
while
she
sang
merrily
and
the
goats
nibbled
the
green
grass
when
the
sun
showed
that
it
was
midday
she
put
aside
her
work
called
her
goats
and
after
giving
them
each
a
morsel
of
bread
bounded
into
the
wood
to
look
for
strawberries
when
she
came
back
she
ate
her
fruit
and
bread
and
folding
her
hands
danced
and
sang
the
goats
enjoying
themselves
among
the
green
grass
thought
what
a
merry
shepherdess
we
have
after
her
dance
she
spun
again
and
at
evening
she
drove
her
goats
home
and
her
mother
never
had
to
scold
her
for
bringing
the
spindle
back
empty
one
lovely
spring
day
just
as
betty
sprang
up
to
dance
suddenly
where
she
came
there
she
came
a
beautiful
maiden
stood
before
her
she
wore
a
white
dress
as
thin
as
gossamer
golden
hair
flowed
to
her
waist
and
on
her
head
was
a
garland
of
wood
flowers
betty
was
struck
dumb
with
astonishment
the
maiden
smiled
at
her
and
said
in
a
very
sweet
voice
betty
are
you
fond
of
dancing
when
the
maiden
spoke
so
prettily
betty
s
terror
quitted
her
and
she
answered
oh
i
should
like
to
dance
all
day
come
then
let
us
dance
together
i
will
teach
you
said
the
maiden
and
she
took
betty
by
the
waist
and
began
to
dance
with
her
as
they
circled
such
delicious
music
sounded
over
their
heads
that
betty
s
heart
skipped
within
her
the
musicians
sat
on
branches
of
the
birches
they
were
clad
in
black
and
variegated
coats
they
were
choice
musicians
who
had
come
together
at
the
call
of
the
beautiful
maiden
nightingales
larks
linnets
goldfinches
thrushes
blackbirds
and
a
very
skillful
betty
s
cheeks
flamed
her
eyes
glittered
she
forgot
her
task
and
her
goats
she
could
only
gaze
at
her
partner
who
whirled
her
around
with
the
most
charming
movements
and
so
lightly
that
the
grass
did
not
bend
beneath
her
delicate
weight
they
danced
from
noon
till
eve
and
betty
s
feet
were
neither
weary
nor
sore
then
the
beautiful
maiden
stopped
the
music
ceased
and
as
she
came
so
she
went
and
she
vanished
as
if
the
earth
had
swallowed
her
betty
looked
about
the
sun
had
set
she
clapped
her
hands
to
the
top
of
her
head
and
remembered
that
her
spindle
was
by
no
means
full
she
took
the
flax
and
put
it
with
the
spindle
into
her
basket
and
drove
the
goats
home
that
night
her
mother
did
not
ask
to
see
her
work
next
morning
betty
again
drove
the
goats
to
pasture
all
happened
as
before
where
she
came
there
she
came
and
the
beautiful
maiden
seized
betty
by
the
waist
and
they
danced
from
noon
till
eve
then
betty
saw
that
the
sun
was
setting
and
her
spindle
nearly
empty
so
she
began
to
cry
but
the
maiden
put
her
hands
to
betty
s
head
took
off
the
flax
and
twined
it
round
the
stem
of
a
slender
birch
and
began
to
spin
the
spindle
just
swung
over
the
ground
it
grew
fuller
and
fuller
and
before
the
sun
set
behind
the
wood
all
the
yarn
was
spun
giving
the
full
spindle
into
betty
s
hands
the
maiden
said
and
grumble
not
reel
and
grumble
not
and
as
she
came
so
she
went
and
she
vanished
as
if
the
ground
had
swallowed
her
betty
drove
the
goats
home
and
gave
her
mother
the
full
spindle
well
the
next
day
all
happened
as
before
where
she
came
there
she
came
and
the
beautiful
maiden
seized
betty
by
the
waist
and
they
danced
from
noon
to
eve
then
the
maiden
handed
betty
a
covered
basket
saying
not
but
go
home
peep
not
but
go
home
and
as
she
came
so
she
went
and
she
vanished
as
if
the
ground
had
swallowed
her
at
first
betty
was
afraid
to
peep
into
the
basket
but
when
she
was
halfway
home
she
could
not
restrain
herself
she
lifted
the
cover
and
peeped
and
oh
how
disappointed
she
was
when
she
saw
that
the
basket
was
full
of
birch
leaves
she
began
to
cry
and
threw
out
two
handfuls
of
the
leaves
and
was
going
to
shake
them
all
out
of
the
basket
but
she
thought
to
herself
they
ll
make
good
litter
for
the
when
she
reached
home
her
mother
was
waiting
for
her
at
the
door
what
sort
of
a
spindle
did
you
bring
home
to
me
yesterday
cried
she
after
you
left
this
morning
i
began
to
reel
i
reeled
and
i
reeled
and
the
spindle
remained
full
one
skein
two
skeins
three
skeins
and
the
spindle
was
yet
full
what
evil
spirit
has
spun
you
grumbled
i
and
at
that
instant
the
yarn
vanished
from
the
spindle
tell
me
the
meaning
of
so
betty
confessed
how
she
had
danced
with
the
beautiful
maiden
who
had
given
her
the
full
spindle
and
who
had
said
reel
and
grumble
that
was
a
cried
her
mother
in
astonishment
about
noon
in
the
the
dance
lucky
for
you
that
she
did
not
tickle
you
to
death
it
s
a
pity
that
you
did
not
tell
me
before
for
i
might
have
had
a
room
full
of
yarn
if
i
had
reeled
and
grumbled
then
betty
bethought
herself
of
the
basket
of
leaves
she
lifted
the
cover
and
peeped
in
again
look
look
mother
she
cried
her
mother
looked
and
clapped
her
hands
the
birch
leaves
were
turned
to
gold
she
told
me
not
to
peep
until
i
reached
home
said
betty
but
i
disobeyed
and
threw
two
handfuls
of
the
leaves
lucky
for
you
that
you
did
not
throw
them
all
away
exclaimed
her
mother
the
next
morning
they
both
went
to
the
place
where
betty
had
thrown
out
the
leaves
but
on
the
road
lay
nothing
but
birch
leaves
however
the
gold
betty
had
brought
home
was
enough
to
make
them
rich
her
mother
bought
a
fine
house
and
garden
they
had
many
cattle
betty
had
handsome
clothes
and
she
did
not
need
to
pasture
the
goats
any
more
but
though
she
had
everything
she
desired
nothing
gave
her
so
great
delight
as
the
dance
with
the
she
often
went
to
the
birch
wood
hoping
to
see
the
beautiful
maiden
but
she
never
again
set
eyes
upon
her

the

monday

there
once
lived
a
lad
in
old
ireland
named
lusmore
he
had
a
great
hump
on
his
back
and
whenever
he
sat
down
he
had
to
rest
his
chin
on
his
knee
for
support
but
in
spite
of
this
he
was
as
happy
as
a
cricket
and
used
to
go
about
the
country
with
a
sprig
of
or
foxglove
in
his
little
straw
hat
he
went
from
house
to
house
plaiting
baskets
out
of
rushes
and
in
that
way
he
earned
a
living
and
he
was
so
merry
that
people
always
gave
him
a
penny
more
than
he
asked
one
evening
he
was
returning
from
a
distant
town
and
as
he
walked
slowly
on
account
of
his
hump
it
grew
dark
before
he
could
reach
home
he
came
to
an
old
mound
by
the
side
of
the
road
and
being
tired
sat
down
on
it
to
rest
he
had
not
been
sitting
there
long
when
he
heard
strains
of
music
and
many
little
voices
singing
sweetly
he
laid
his
ear
to
the
mound
and
perceived
that
the
music
and
singing
came
from
inside
it
and
he
could
hear
the
words
that
the
little
voices
were
chanting
over
and
over
again
tuesday
monday
tuesday
monday
tuesday
it
was
all
so
very
sweet
that
lusmore
listened
with
delight
but
by
and
by
he
grew
tired
of
hearing
the
same
words
sung
over
and
over
he
waited
politely
until
the
voices
had
finished
their
song
then
he
called
wednesday
the
fairies
for
it
was
the
singing
of
fairies
that
he
heard
were
so
pleased
with
lusmore
s
addition
to
their
words
that
they
pulled
him
right
down
through
the
top
of
the
mound
with
the
speed
of
a
whirlwind
and
he
went
falling
and
twirling
round
and
round
as
light
as
a
feather
he
found
himself
in
a
palace
so
bright
that
it
dazzled
his
eyes
then
all
the
fairies
stopped
capering
and
dancing
and
came
crowding
around
him
and
one
wearing
a
crown
stepped
forward
and
said
lusmore
the
hump
that
you
wore
on
your
back
is
no
more
look
down
on
the
floor
and
see
it
lusmore
and
as
these
words
were
being
said
lusmore
felt
himself
grow
so
light
and
happy
that
he
could
have
bounded
up
to
the
moon
and
he
saw
his
hump
tumble
off
his
back
and
roll
on
the
floor
then
the
fairies
took
hands
and
danced
around
him
and
as
they
did
so
he
became
dizzy
and
fell
asleep
when
he
opened
his
eyes
it
was
broad
daylight
and
the
sun
was
shining
and
the
birds
were
singing
and
cows
and
sheep
were
grazing
peacefully
around
him
he
put
his
hand
to
his
hump
it
was
gone
and
there
he
was
as
tall
straight
and
handsome
as
any
other
lad
in
ireland
and
besides
all
that
he
was
dressed
in
a
full
suit
of
beautiful
clothes
he
went
toward
his
home
stepping
out
lightly
and
jumping
high
at
every
step
so
full
of
joy
was
he
and
as
he
passed
his
neighbours
they
hardly
knew
him
without
his
hump
and
because
he
was
so
straight
and
handsome
and
was
dressed
so
finely
now
in
another
village
not
far
away
lived
a
lad
named
jack
madden
he
also
had
a
great
hump
on
his
back
he
was
a
peevish
cunning
creature
and
liked
to
scratch
and
pinch
all
who
came
near
him
when
he
heard
how
the
fairies
had
taken
away
lusmore
s
hump
he
decided
that
he
too
would
visit
them
so
one
night
after
darkness
had
fallen
he
sat
down
on
the
mound
all
alone
and
waited
he
had
not
been
there
long
before
he
heard
the
music
and
the
sweet
voices
singing
tuesday
monday
tuesday
monday
tuesday
and
wednesday
and
as
he
was
in
a
very
great
hurry
to
get
rid
of
his
hump
he
did
not
wait
for
the
fairies
to
finish
their
song
but
yelled
out
thinking
that
two
days
were
better
than
one
thursday
and
friday
no
sooner
had
the
words
left
his
lips
than
he
was
taken
up
quickly
and
whisked
through
the
mound
with
terrific
force
and
the
fairies
came
crowding
around
him
screeching
and
buzzing
with
anger
and
crying
out
song
you
have
spoiled
our
song
you
have
spoiled
our
song
you
have
spoiled
then
the
one
wearing
the
crown
stepped
forward
and
said
madden
jack
madden
your
words
came
so
bad
in
that
your
life
we
will
sadden
here
s
two
humps
for
jack
madden
and
quick
as
a
wink
twenty
fairies
brought
lusmore
s
hump
and
clapped
it
down
on
jack
madden
s
back
and
there
it
was
fixed
as
firmly
as
if
nailed
on
with
tenpenny
nails
then
out
of
the
mound
they
kicked
him
and
when
morning
was
come
he
crept
home
with
the
two
humps
on
his
back
and
he
is
wearing
them
still
the
greedy
old
man
long
ago
in
cornwall
on
a
hillock
called
the
gump
there
was
a
fairy
ring
many
a
good
old
man
or
woman
on
moonlit
nights
had
seen
the
fairies
dancing
there
at
their
revels
and
had
been
rewarded
with
gifts
small
but
rich
now
there
was
one
greedy
old
man
who
having
heard
his
neighbours
tell
of
the
fairy
gold
at
the
revels
decided
to
steal
some
of
the
treasure
so
on
a
moonlit
night
when
all
was
quiet
he
stole
softly
up
to
the
as
he
drew
near
he
heard
delightful
music
which
seemed
to
come
from
inside
the
hillock
the
notes
were
now
slow
and
solemn
and
now
quick
and
gay
so
that
the
old
man
had
to
weep
and
laugh
in
one
breath
then
before
he
knew
it
he
began
to
dance
to
the
fairy
measure
he
was
forced
by
some
unseen
power
to
whirl
round
and
round
but
in
spite
of
this
he
kept
his
wits
about
him
and
watched
to
see
what
would
happen
suddenly
there
was
a
crashing
sound
and
a
door
in
the
hillock
opened
instantly
the
old
man
saw
that
everything
about
him
was
ablaze
with
coloured
lights
each
blade
of
grass
was
hung
with
tiny
bright
lamps
and
every
tree
and
bush
was
illuminated
with
stars
out
of
the
opening
in
the
hillock
marched
a
band
of
goblins
as
if
to
clear
the
way
then
came
a
number
of
fairy
musicians
playing
on
every
kind
of
musical
instrument
these
were
followed
by
troop
after
troop
of
elfin
soldiers
carrying
waving
banners
the
soldiers
arranged
themselves
in
two
files
on
either
side
of
the
door
but
the
goblins
much
to
the
old
man
s
disgust
placed
themselves
close
behind
him
as
they
were
no
bigger
than
his
thumb
he
thought
to
himself
if
they
bother
me
i
can
easily
step
on
them
and
crush
them
with
my
this
vast
array
having
disposed
itself
next
from
the
hillock
came
a
crowd
of
elfin
servants
carrying
pitchers
of
silver
and
gold
and
goblets
cut
out
of
diamonds
rubies
emeralds
and
other
precious
stones
servants
followed
bearing
aloft
gold
and
silver
platters
heaped
high
with
the
richest
meats
pastries
candies
and
glowing
fruits
a
number
of
elfin
boys
clad
in
crimson
then
set
out
small
tables
made
of
ivory
curiously
carved
and
the
servants
arranged
the
feast
with
order
then
out
of
the
hillock
came
crowding
thousands
and
thousands
of
lovely
winged
fairies
clad
in
gossamer
robes
of
every
colour
like
the
rainbow
the
music
suddenly
changed
to
low
delicate
notes
and
the
old
man
found
that
he
was
no
longer
forced
to
dance
and
whirl
about
and
as
he
stood
still
the
perfume
of
a
thousand
rich
flowers
filled
the
air
and
the
whole
vast
host
of
fairies
began
to
sing
a
song
as
clear
and
sweet
as
the
tinkle
of
silver
bells
then
from
the
hillock
issued
forth
line
after
line
of
elfin
boys
dressed
in
green
and
gold
and
behind
them
on
an
ivory
throne
borne
aloft
by
a
hundred
fairies
came
the
king
and
queen
of
fairyland
blazing
with
beauty
and
jewels
the
throne
was
placed
upon
the
hillock
which
immediately
bloomed
with
lilies
and
roses
before
the
king
and
queen
was
set
the
most
beautiful
of
all
the
little
tables
laden
with
gold
and
silver
dishes
and
precious
goblets
the
fairies
took
their
places
at
the
other
tables
and
began
to
feast
with
a
will
now
thought
the
old
man
my
time
is
come
if
only
i
can
creep
up
without
being
seen
to
the
fairy
king
s
table
i
shall
be
able
to
snatch
enough
gold
to
make
me
rich
for
and
with
his
greedy
mind
set
on
this
he
crouched
down
and
began
very
slowly
to
creep
toward
the
throne
but
he
did
not
see
that
thousands
of
goblins
had
cast
fine
threads
about
his
body
and
were
holding
the
ends
in
their
hands
trembling
with
greed
the
old
man
crept
closer
and
closer
to
the
fairy
king
and
queen
he
took
his
hat
from
his
head
and
raised
it
carefully
to
cover
the
royal
throne
and
table
and
as
he
did
so
he
heard
a
shrill
whistle
instantly
his
hand
was
fixed
powerless
in
the
air
then
with
a
sudden
crash
all
became
dark
around
him
whirr
whirr
whirr
and
he
heard
as
if
a
flight
of
bees
were
brushing
past
his
ears
and
suddenly
his
body
from
head
to
foot
was
stabbed
with
pins
and
pinched
with
tweezers
then
he
was
thrown
violently
upon
his
back
with
his
arms
outstretched
and
his
arms
and
legs
were
fastened
to
the
ground
with
magic
chains
his
tongue
seemed
tied
with
cords
so
that
he
could
not
call
out
and
as
he
lay
there
trembling
with
fright
and
pain
he
felt
as
though
swarms
of
insects
were
running
over
him
then
he
saw
standing
on
his
nose
a
grinning
goblin
this
little
monster
stamped
and
jumped
with
great
delight
then
making
a
fearful
grimace
shouted
away
i
smell
the
day
and
on
this
an
army
of
goblins
fairies
and
elves
who
were
running
up
and
down
the
old
man
s
body
stabbing
him
with
pins
and
pinching
him
with
tweezers
jumped
quickly
down
and
rushed
into
the
hillock
which
closed
immediately
and
the
old
man
saw
the
fairies
no
more
at
length
the
sun
rose
and
he
found
that
he
was
tied
to
the
ground
with
a
myriad
of
gossamer
webs
which
were
covered
with
that
glistened
like
diamonds
in
the
sunlight
he
shook
himself
free
and
got
up
wet
cold
ashamed
and
pinched
black
and
blue
he
returned
to
his
home
and
you
may
be
sure
that
he
never
again
tried
to
steal
the
fairy
gold
legend
of
bottle
hill
it
was
in
the
good
days
when
the
little
people
were
more
frequently
seen
than
they
are
in
these
unbelieving
times
that
a
farmer
named
mick
purcell
rented
a
few
acres
of
barren
ground
not
far
from
the
city
of
cork
mick
had
a
wife
and
seven
children
they
did
all
that
they
could
to
get
on
which
was
very
little
for
the
poor
man
had
no
child
grown
big
enough
to
help
him
in
his
work
and
all
that
the
poor
woman
could
do
was
to
mind
the
children
milk
the
cow
boil
the
potatoes
and
carry
the
eggs
to
market
so
besides
the
difficulty
of
getting
enough
to
eat
it
was
hard
on
them
to
pay
the
rent
well
they
did
manage
to
get
along
for
a
good
while
but
at
last
came
a
bad
year
and
the
little
field
of
oats
was
spoiled
and
the
chickens
died
of
the
pip
and
the
pig
got
the
measles
and
poor
mick
found
that
he
hadn
t
enough
to
pay
half
his
rent
why
then
molly
said
he
what
ll
we
do
wisha
then
mavourneen
what
would
you
do
but
take
the
cow
to
the
fair
of
cork
and
sell
her
said
she
and
monday
is
so
you
must
go
and
what
ll
we
do
when
she
s
gone
said
mick
never
a
know
i
know
mick
but
sure
god
won
t
leave
us
without
help
and
you
know
how
good
he
was
to
us
when
little
billy
was
sick
and
we
had
nothing
at
all
for
him
to
take
that
good
doctor
gentleman
came
riding
past
and
asked
for
a
drink
of
milk
and
he
gave
us
two
shillings
and
sent
me
things
and
a
bottle
for
the
child
and
he
came
to
see
billy
and
never
left
off
his
goodness
until
he
was
oh
you
are
always
hopeful
molly
and
i
believe
you
are
right
after
all
mick
said
so
i
won
t
be
sorry
for
selling
the
cow
i
ll
go
and
you
must
put
a
needle
and
thread
through
my
coat
for
you
know
it
s
ripped
under
the
molly
told
him
he
should
have
everything
right
and
about
twelve
o
clock
the
next
day
he
left
her
after
having
promised
not
to
sell
his
cow
except
for
the
highest
penny
he
drove
the
beast
slowly
through
a
little
stream
that
crossed
the
road
under
the
walls
of
an
old
fort
and
as
he
passed
he
glanced
his
eyes
on
a
pile
of
stones
and
an
old
elder
tree
that
stood
up
sharply
against
the
sky
oh
then
if
only
i
had
half
the
fairy
money
that
is
buried
in
yon
fort
tisn
t
driving
this
cow
i
d
be
now
said
he
aloud
then
he
moved
on
after
his
beast
twas
a
fine
day
and
the
sun
shone
brightly
and
after
he
had
gone
six
miles
he
came
to
that
hill
bottle
hill
it
is
called
now
but
that
was
not
the
name
of
it
then
good
morrow
mick
said
a
little
voice
and
with
that
a
little
man
started
up
out
of
the
hill
good
morrow
kindly
said
mick
and
he
looked
at
the
stranger
who
was
like
a
dwarf
with
a
bit
of
an
old
wrinkled
face
for
all
the
world
like
a
dried
cauliflower
only
he
had
a
sharp
red
nose
red
eyes
and
white
hair
his
eyes
were
never
quiet
but
looked
at
everything
and
it
made
mick
s
blood
run
cold
just
to
see
them
roll
so
rapidly
from
side
to
side
in
truth
mick
did
not
like
the
little
man
s
company
at
all
and
he
drove
his
cow
somewhat
faster
but
the
little
man
kept
up
with
him
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
mick
could
see
that
he
moved
over
the
road
without
lifting
one
foot
after
the
other
and
the
poor
fellow
s
heart
trembled
within
him
where
are
you
going
with
that
cow
honest
man
said
the
little
man
at
last
to
the
fair
of
cork
then
said
mick
trembling
even
more
at
the
shrill
and
piercing
voice
are
you
going
to
sell
her
asked
the
little
man
why
then
what
else
am
i
going
for
but
to
sell
her
will
you
sell
her
to
me
mick
started
he
was
afraid
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
little
man
but
he
was
more
afraid
to
say
no
i
ll
tell
you
what
i
ll
give
you
this
bottle
said
the
little
man
pulling
a
bottle
from
under
his
coat
mick
looked
at
him
and
the
bottle
and
in
spite
of
his
terror
he
could
not
help
bursting
into
a
loud
fit
of
laughter
laugh
if
you
will
said
the
little
man
but
i
tell
you
that
this
bottle
is
better
for
you
than
all
the
money
you
will
get
for
the
cow
at
cork
aye
than
ten
thousand
times
as
mick
laughed
again
why
then
said
he
do
you
think
i
am
such
a
fool
as
to
give
my
good
cow
for
a
bottle
and
an
empty
one
too
indeed
then
i
won
t
you
d
better
give
me
the
cow
and
take
the
bottle
you
ll
not
be
sorry
for
it
said
the
little
man
why
then
what
would
molly
say
i
d
never
hear
the
last
of
it
and
how
should
i
pay
the
rent
and
what
should
we
do
without
a
penny
of
money
when
you
go
home
never
mind
if
your
wife
is
angry
answered
the
little
man
but
quiet
yourself
and
make
her
sweep
the
room
and
set
the
table
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
spread
the
best
cover
on
it
then
put
the
bottle
on
the
ground
saying
these
words
bottle
do
your
duty
and
you
will
see
the
end
of
and
is
this
all
said
mick
no
more
said
the
stranger
forcing
the
bottle
into
mick
s
hand
then
he
moved
swiftly
off
after
the
cow
well
mick
rather
sick
at
heart
retraced
his
steps
toward
his
cabin
and
as
he
went
he
could
not
help
turning
his
head
to
look
after
the
little
man
but
he
had
vanished
completely
he
can
t
belong
to
this
earth
exclaimed
mick
in
horror
to
himself
but
where
is
the
cow
she
too
was
gone
and
mick
hurried
homeward
muttering
prayers
and
holding
fast
the
bottle
he
soon
reached
his
cabin
and
surprised
his
wife
sitting
over
the
turf
fire
in
the
big
chimney
oh
mick
are
you
come
back
said
she
sure
you
weren
t
at
cork
all
the
way
what
has
happened
to
you
where
is
the
cow
did
you
sell
her
how
much
money
did
you
get
for
her
what
news
have

tell
us
why
then
molly
if
you
ll
give
me
time
i
ll

you
all
about

oh
then

where

a
while
molly
and
i
ll

but

bottle
under
your
waistcoat
said
molly
seeing
its
neck
sticking
out
why
then
be
easy
about
it
said
mick
till
i
tell
it
and
putting
the
bottle
on
the
table
he
added
that
s
all
i
got
for
the
his
poor
wife
was
thunderstruck
she
sat
crying
while
mick
told
her
his
story
with
many
a
crossing
and
blessing
between
him
and
harm
she
could
not
help
believing
him
for
she
had
great
faith
in
fairies
so
she
got
up
and
without
saying
a
word
began
to
sweep
the
earthen
floor
with
a
bunch
of
heather
then
she
tidied
everything
and
put
the
long
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
spread
over
it
a
clean
cloth
and
then
mick
placing
the
bottle
on
the
ground
said
bottle
do
your
duty
look
look
there
mammy
cried
his
eldest
son
look
there
look
there
and
he
sprang
to
his
mother
s
side
as
two
tiny
fellows
rose
like
light
from
the
bottle
and
in
an
instant
they
covered
the
table
with
dishes
and
plates
of
gold
and
silver
full
of
the
finest
victuals
that
ever
were
seen
and
when
all
was
done
the
two
tiny
fellows
went
into
the
bottle
again
mick
and
his
wife
looked
at
everything
with
astonishment
they
had
never
seen
such
dishes
and
plates
before
and
the
very
sight
of
them
almost
took
their
appetites
away
but
at
length
molly
said
come
and
sit
down
mick
and
try
to
eat
a
bit
sure
you
ought
to
be
hungry
after
such
a
good
day
s
work
so
they
all
sat
down
at
the
table
after
they
had
eaten
as
much
as
they
wished
molly
said
i
wonder
will
those
two
good
little
gentlemen
carry
away
these
fine
they
waited
but
no
one
came
so
molly
put
the
dishes
and
plates
carefully
aside
the
next
day
mick
went
to
cork
and
sold
some
of
them
and
bought
a
horse
and
cart
weeks
passed
by
and
the
neighbours
saw
that
mick
was
making
money
and
though
he
and
his
wife
did
all
they
could
to
keep
the
bottle
a
secret
their
landlord
soon
found
out
about
it
then
he
took
the
bottle
by
force
away
from
mick
and
carried
it
carefully
home
as
for
mick
and
his
wife
they
had
so
much
money
left
that
the
loss
of
the
bottle
did
not
worry
them
much
at
first
but
they
kept
on
spending
their
wealth
as
if
there
was
no
end
to
it
and
to
make
a
long
story
short
they
became
poorer
and
poorer
until
they
had
to
sell
their
last
cow
so
one
morning
early
mick
once
more
drove
his
cow
to
the
fair
of
cork
it
was
hardly
daybreak
when
he
left
home
and
he
walked
on
until
he
reached
the
big
hill
and
just
as
he
got
to
its
top
and
cast
his
eyes
before
and
around
him
up
started
the
little
man
out
of
the
hill
well
mick
purcell
said
he
i
told
you
that
you
would
be
a
rich
man
indeed
then
so
i
was
that
is
no
lie
for
you
sir
replied
mick
but
it
s
not
rich
i
am
now
and
if
you
happen
to
have
another
bottle
here
is
the
cow
for
and
here
is
the
bottle
said
the
little
man
smiling
you
know
what
to
do
with
and
with
that
both
the
cow
and
the
stranger
disappeared
as
they
had
done
before
mick
hurried
away
anxious
to
get
home
with
the
bottle
he
arrived
with
it
safely
enough
and
called
out
to
molly
to
put
the
room
to
rights
and
to
lay
a
clean
cloth
on
the
table
which
she
did
mick
set
the
bottle
on
the
ground
and
cried
out
bottle
do
your
duty
in
a
twinkling
two
great
stout
men
with
two
huge
clubs
issued
from
the
bottle
and
belaboured
poor
mick
and
his
family
until
they
lay
groaning
on
the
floor
then
the
two
men
went
into
the
bottle
again
mick
as
soon
as
he
came
to
himself
got
up
and
looked
around
him
he
thought
and
he
thought
he
lifted
up
his
wife
and
children
then
leaving
them
to
recover
as
best
they
could
he
put
the
bottle
under
his
arm
and
went
to
visit
his
landlord
the
landlord
was
having
a
great
feast
and
when
he
saw
that
mick
had
another
bottle
he
invited
him
heartily
to
come
in
show
us
your
bottle
mick
said
he
so
mick
set
it
on
the
floor
and
spoke
the
proper
words
and
in
a
moment
the
landlord
tumbled
to
the
floor
and
all
his
guests
were
running
and
roaring
and
sprawling
and
kicking
and
shrieking
while
the
two
great
stout
men
belaboured
them
well
stop
those
two
scoundrels
mick
purcell
shouted
the
landlord
or
i
ll
hang
you
they
shall
never
stop
said
mick
till
i
get
my
own
bottle
that
i
see
on
top
of
yon
give
it
to
him
give
it
to
him
before
we
are
killed
cried
the
landlord
mick
put
his
old
bottle
in
his
bosom
then
the
two
great
stout
men
jumped
into
the
new
one
and
mick
carried
both
bottles
safely
home
and
to
make
my
story
short
from
that
time
on
mick
prospered
he
got
richer
than
ever
and
his
son
married
the
landlord
s
daughter
and
both
mick
and
his
wife
lived
to
a
great
old
age
they
died
on
the
same
day
and
at
their
wake
the
servants
broke
both
bottles
but
the
hill
has
the
name
upon
it
for
so
it
will
always
be
bottle
hill
to
the
end
of
the
world
for
this
is
a
strange
story
the
brown
dwarf
the
pleasant
isle
of
rügen
looks
the
baltic
water
o
er
to
the
beaches
of
the
pomeranian
shore
and
in
the
town
of
rambin
a
little
boy
and
maid
plucked
the
together
and
in
the
played
alike
were
they
in
beauty
if
not
in
their
degree
he
was
the
amptman
s
the
miller
s
child
was
she
now
of
old
the
isle
of
rügen
was
full
of
dwarfs
and
trolls
the
little
the
people
without
souls
and
for
every
man
and
woman
in
rügen
s
island
found
walking
in
air
and
sunshine
a
troll
was
underground
it
chanced
the
little
maiden
one
morning
strolled
away
among
the
haunted
nine
hills
where
the
elves
and
goblins
play
that
day
in
barley
fields
below
the
harvesters
had
known
of
evil
voices
in
the
air
and
heard
the
small
horns
blown
she
came
not
back
the
search
for
her
in
field
and
wood
was
vain
they
cried
her
east
they
cried
her
west
but
she
came
not
again
she
s
down
among
the
brown
dwarfs
said
the
wise
and
old
and
prayers
were
made
and
masses
said
and
rambin
s
church
bell
tolled
five
years
her
father
mourned
her
and
then
john
deitrich
said
i
will
find
my
little
playmate
be
she
alive
or
he
watched
among
the
nine
hills
he
heard
the
brown
dwarfs
sing
and
saw
them
dance
by
moonlight
merrily
in
a
ring
and
when
their
leader
tossed
up
his
cap
of
red
young
deitrich
caught
it
as
it
fell
and
thrust
it
on
his
head
the
troll
came
crouching
at
his
feet
and
wept
for
lack
of
it
oh
give
me
back
my
magic
cap
for
your
great
head
unfit
nay
deitrich
said
the
dwarf
who
throws
his
charmèd
cap
away
must
serve
its
finder
at
his
will
and
for
his
folly
pay
you
stole
my
pretty
lisbeth
and
hid
her
in
the
earth
and
you
shall
ope
the
door
of
glass
and
let
me
lead
her
she
will
not
come
she
s
one
of
us
she
s
mine
the
brown
dwarf
said
the
day
is
set
the
cake
is
baked
we
shall
the
fell
fiend
fetch
thee
deitrich
cried
and
keep
thy
foul
tongue
still
quick
open
to
thy
evil
world
the
glass
door
of
the
hill
the
dwarf
obeyed
and
youth
and
troll
down
the
long
stairway
passed
and
saw
in
dim
and
sunless
light
a
country
strange
and
vast
weird
rich
and
wonderful
he
saw
the
elfin
its
palaces
of
precious
stones
its
streets
of
golden
sand
he
came
into
a
with
tables
richly
spread
where
a
young
maiden
served
to
him
the
red
wine
and
the
bread
how
fair
she
seemed
among
the
trolls
so
ugly
and
so
wild
yet
pale
and
very
sorrowful
like
one
who
never
smiled
her
low
sweet
voice
her
hair
her
tender
blue
eyes
seemed
like
something
he
had
seen
elsewhere
or
something
he
had
dreamed
he
looked
he
clasped
her
in
his
arms
he
knew
the
one
o
lisbeth
see
thy
playmate
i
am
the
amptman
s
son
she
leaned
her
fair
head
on
his
breast
and
through
her
sobs
she
spoke
oh
take
me
from
this
evil
place
and
from
the
elfin
folk
and
let
me
tread
the
fields
and
smell
the
flowers
again
and
feel
the
soft
wind
on
my
cheek
and
hear
the
dropping
rain
and
oh
to
hear
the
singing
bird
the
rustling
of
the
tree
the
lowing
cows
the
bleat
of
sheep
the
voices
of
the
sea
and
oh
upon
my
father
s
knee
to
sit
beside
the
door
and
hear
the
bell
of
vespers
ring
in
rambin
church
once
more
he
kissed
her
cheek
he
kissed
her
lips
the
brown
dwarf
groaned
to
see
and
tore
his
tangled
hair
and
ground
his
long
teeth
angrily
but
deitrich
said
for
five
long
years
this
tender
christian
maid
has
served
you
in
your
evil
world
and
well
must
she
be
paid
haste
hither
bring
me
precious
gems
the
richest
in
your
store
then
when
we
pass
the
gate
of
glass
you
ll
take
your
cap
once
no
choice
was
left
the
baffled
troll
and
murmuring
he
obeyed
and
filled
the
pockets
of
the
youth
and
apron
of
the
maid
they
left
the
dreadful
and
passed
the
gate
of
glass
they
felt
the
sunshine
s
warm
caress
they
trod
the
soft
green
grass
and
when
beneath
they
saw
the
dwarf
stretch
up
to
them
his
brown
and
crooked
fingers
they
tossed
his
red
cap
down
oh
never
shone
so
bright
a
sun
was
never
sky
so
blue
as
hand
in
hand
they
homeward
walked
the
pleasant
meadows
through
and
never
sang
the
birds
so
sweet
in
rambin
s
woods
before
and
never
washed
the
waves
so
soft
along
the
baltic
shore
and
when
beneath
his
trees
the
father
met
his
child
the
bells
rung
out
their
merriest
peal
the
folks
with
joy
ran
wild
and
soon
from
rambin
s
holy
church
the
twain
came
forth
as
one
the
amptman
kissed
a
daughter
the
miller
blest

he
set
a
cross
of
stone
and
elf
and
brown
dwarf
sought
in
vain
a
door
where

was

tower

built
in

and

deitrich
and
his
lovely
bride
dwelt
long
and
happy
there
greenleaf
little
men
and
treasures
of
gold
will
you
come
away
my
lad
and
search
for
the
pots
of
gold
and
lie
buried
without
little
men
with
wagging
beards
guard
all
with
and
you
must
catch
a
little
man
then
he
the
word
will
tell
magic
word
that
opes
the
hills
unearths
the
golden
crocks
uncloses
all
the
and
breaks
the
the
boy
who
found
the
pots
of
gold
there
was
once
a
poor
boy
who
used
to
drive
his
cart
along
the
road
and
sell
turf
to
the
neighbours
he
was
a
strange
boy
very
silent
and
spent
his
evenings
in
his
little
hut
where
he
lived
alone
reading
old
bits
of
books
he
had
picked
up
in
his
rambles
and
as
he
read
he
longed
to
be
rich
and
live
in
a
fine
house
with
a
garden
all
round
him
and
to
have
plenty
of
books
now
he
once
read
how
the
fairies
shoemakers
the
leprechauns
merry
tricksy
little
sprites
sit
at
sunset
under
the
hedges
mending
the
shoes
of
elfin
folk
and
how
they
chuckle
as
they
work
for
they
know
where
the
pots
of
fairy
gold
are
hidden
so
evening
after
evening
the
boy
watched
the
hedges
hoping
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
a
little
cobbler
and
to
hear
the
of
his
tiny
hammer
at
last
one
evening
just
as
the
sun
was
setting
the
boy
saw
a
little
leprechaun
sitting
under
a
and
working
away
hard
on
a
small
boot
he
was
dressed
in
green
and
wore
a
red
cap
on
his
head
the
boy
jumped
down
from
his
cart
and
catching
the
leprechaun
by
the
neck
cried
merrily
ho
ho
my
fine
little
man
you
can
t
get
away
until
you
tell
me
where
the
fairy
gold
is
hidden
easy
now
said
the
little
man
laughing
don
t
hurt
me
and
i
ll
tell
you
all
about
it
i
could
harm
you
if
i
wished
for
i
have
the
power
but
i
like
you
and
you
are
an
industrious
lad
so
carry
me
to
yonder
fort
and
i
ll
show
you
the
carrying
the
leprechaun
carefully
the
boy
took
a
few
steps
and
found
himself
close
to
the
ruins
of
an
old
fort
a
door
opened
in
a
stone
wall
and
he
walked
in
now
look
around
said
the
leprechaun
then
the
boy
saw
that
the
whole
ground
was
covered
with
gold
pieces
while
pots
full
of
gold
and
silver
money
stood
about
in
such
plenty
that
it
seemed
as
if
all
the
riches
of
the
world
were
there
take
what
you
want
said
the
leprechaun
and
be
quick
about
it
for
if
the
door
shuts
you
will
never
leave
this
place
the
boy
hurried
and
gathered
his
arms
full
of
gold
and
silver
and
hastening
out
of
the
door
flung
all
into
the
cart
then
he
brought
out
some
of
the
pots
but
when
he
was
on
his
way
back
for
more
the
door
shut
with
a
clap
like
thunder
and
night
fell
and
all
was
dark
the
boy
saw
no
more
of
the
leprechaun
and
as
he
could
not
even
thank
him
he
thought
that
it
was
best
to
drive
home
at
once
and
hide
his
treasure
when
he
reached
his
hut
he
counted
all
the
bright
yellow
pieces
and
shining
silver
ones
and
found
that
he
was
as
rich
as
a
king
and
because
he
was
wise
he
told
no
one
about
his
adventure
but
the
next
day
drove
to
town
and
put
all
his
money
in
the
bank
after
that
he
ordered
a
fine
house
and
laid
out
a
spacious
garden
and
had
servants
and
carriages
and
many
books
then
he
married
the
daughter
of
a
magistrate
and
became
great
and
powerful
his
memory
is
still
held
in
reverence
by
his
townspeople
his
descendants
are
living
rich
and
happy
and
no
matter
how
much
they
give
to
the
poor
their
wealth
always
increases
the
ragweed
tom
was
as
clean
clever
and
tight
looking
a
lad
as
any
in
the
whole
county
cork
one
fine
holiday
in
he
was
taking
a
ramble
and
was
sauntering
along
the
sunny
side
of
a
hedge
when
suddenly
he
heard
a
crackling
sound
among
the
leaves
dear
me
said
he
but
isn
t
it
really
surprising
to
hear
the
singing
so
late
in
the
season
and
with
that
he
stole
along
going
on
the
tips
of
his
toes
to
see
if
he
could
get
sight
of
what
was
making
the
noise
he
looked
sharply
under
the
bushes
and
what
should
he
see
in
a
nook
in
the
hedge
but
a
big
brown
pitcher
holding
a
gallon
or
more
of
dark
looking
liquor
and
standing
close
to
it
was
a
little
diny
dony
bit
of
an
old
man
as
big
as
your
thumb
with
a
tiny
cocked
hat
stuck
on
the
top
of
his
head
and
a
deesy
daushy
leather
apron
hanging
down
before
him
the
little
old
man
pulled
a
little
brown
stool
from
under
the
hedge
and
standing
upon
it
dipped
a
little
cup
into
the
pitcher
then
he
took
the
cup
out
full
of
the
brown
liquor
and
putting
it
on
the
ground
sat
down
on
the
stool
under
the
shadow
of
the
pitcher
he
began
to
put
a
on
a
bit
of
a
boot
just
the
size
for
himself
bless
my
soul
said
tom
to
himself
in
great
surprise
i
ve
often
heard
tell
of
the
leprechauns
but
i
never
rightly
believed
in
them
but
here
s
one
in
real
earnest
now
if
i
set
about
things
right
i
m
a
made
man
folks
say
that
a
body
must
never
take
his
eyes
off
them
or
they
ll
get
so
tom
stole
nearer
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
little
man
just
as
a
cat
does
with
a
mouse
and
when
he
got
close
up
to
him
he
said
softly
how
goes
your
work
neighbour
the
little
man
raised
his
head
very
well
thank
you
kindly
said
he
i
m
surprised
that
you
should
be
working
on
a
holiday
said
tom
that
s
my
own
business
not
yours
said
the
little
man
well
will
you
be
civil
enough
to
tell
me
what
s
in
your
pitcher
said
tom
that
i
will
with
pleasure
said
the
little
man
tis
elfin
elfin
beer
said
tom
thunder
and
fire
where
did
you
get
it
why
i
made
it
i
made
it
of
heath
said
the
little
man
of
heath
said
tom
bursting
out
laughing
and
will
you
give
a
body
a
taste
of
it
asked
he
i
ll
tell
you
what
it
is
young
man
said
the
leprechaun
it
would
be
fitter
for
you
to
be
looking
after
your
cows
that
have
broken
into
the
oats
yonder
than
to
stand
here
asking
honest
folks
foolish
questions
tom
was
so
taken
by
surprise
at
this
that
he
was
just
going
to
turn
his
head
to
look
for
the
cows
when
he
remembered
not
to
take
his
eyes
off
the
leprechaun
instead
he
made
a
grab
at
the
little
man
and
caught
him
up
in
his
hand
but
as
bad
luck
would
have
it
he
overturned
the
pitcher
with
his
foot
and
all
the
liquor
was
spilt
you
little
rogue
cried
he
shaking
the
leprechaun
hard
and
looking
very
wicked
and
angry
tell
me
where
your
gold
is
hidden
and
show
me
all
your
money
at
that
the
little
man
was
quite
frightened
come
along
with
me
said
he
and
i
ll
show
you
a
crock
of
gold
in
a
field
over
so
they
went
tom
holding
the
leprechaun
very
tightly
and
never
taking
his
eyes
off
him
they
crossed
hedges
and
ditches
and
a
crooked
bit
of
bog
until
they
came
to
a
great
field
of
ragweed
then
the
leprechaun
pointed
to
one
of
the
weeds
and
said
dig
under
that
and
you
ll
get
a
crock
full
of
as
tom
had
no
spade
with
him
he
thought
to
himself
i
ll
run
home
and
fetch
one
and
so
that
i
ll
know
the
place
again
i
ll
tie
my
garter
around
this
so
he
tied
his
red
garter
around
the
ragweed
i
suppose
said
the
leprechaun
politely
that
now
you
have
no
further
use
for
no
said
tom
you
may
go
if
you
wish
and
thank
you
very
kindly
he
said
laughing
loudly
for
showing
me
where
all
your
money
lies
well
to
you
tom
said
the
little
man
and
much
good
may
it
do
you
what
you
ll
get
said
he
and
with
that
he
jumped
behind
the
weed
and
vanished
so
tom
ran
home
for
dear
life
and
fetched
a
spade
and
then
back
as
hard
as
he
could
go
to
the
field
but
when
he
got
there
lo
and
behold
not
a
ragweed
in
the
whole
field
but
had
a
red
garter
just
like
his
own
tied
to
it
and
as
for
digging
up
that
whole
field
it
was
out
of
the
question
for
there
were
more
than
forty
good
irish
acres
in
it
so
tom
went
home
again
with
his
spade
a
little
cooler
and
you
may
be
sure
ashamed
to
tell
any
one
about
the
neat
turn
the
leprechaun
had
served
him
the
bad
boy
and
the
leprechaun
now
it
is
well
known
that
if
a
leprechaun
is
offended
he
can
be
most
malicious
so
one
must
treat
him
politely
or
he
will
not
reveal
where
the
pots
of
fairy
gold
are
hidden
it
happened
one
afternoon
that
a
lad
was
working
in
the
fields
when
he
heard
at
his
feet
rip
rap
tick
tack
and
looking
down
he
saw
a
little
fellow
no
bigger
than
his
hand
sitting
under
a
mending
shoes
he
grabbed
him
up
and
putting
him
in
his
pocket
ran
home
there
was
no
one
in
the
house
so
he
tied
the
leprechaun
to
the
hob
saying
tell
me
you
little
rogue
where
i
may
find
a
pot
of
that
i
will
not
tell
you
replied
the
leprechaun
unless
you
let
me
go
so
that
i
may
finish
cobbling
the
elfin
king
s
i
ll
make
you
tell
me
where
the
gold
is
said
the
lad
and
with
that
he
built
a
rousing
fire
under
the
leprechaun
to
roast
him
oh
take
me
off
take
me
off
yelled
the
little
fellow
and
i
ll
tell
you
just
go
to
the
under
which
i
was
sitting
and
there
is
the
pot
of
gold
only
go
dig
and
find
it
before
the
sun
the
lad
was
so
delighted
that
without
stopping
to
untie
the
leprechaun
he
ran
out
of
the
house
it
happened
that
his
mother
was
just
coming
in
with
a
pail
of
new
milk
he
hit
the
pail
and
spilt
the
milk
on
the
floor
but
he
ran
on
laughing
and
when
his
mother
saw
the
leprechaun
struggling
on
the
hob
she
was
furiously
angry
see
what
bad
luck
you
have
brought
us
you
rogue
she
cried
and
with
that
she
untied
the
little
fellow
and
kicked
him
out
of
the
house
but
the
lad
ran
on
until
he
came
to
the
and
he
dug
and
dug
and
dug
but
there
was
no
pot
of
gold
there
for
the
sun
had
set
so
he
started
sorrowfully
for
home
and
just
as
he
was
passing
an
old
fort
he
heard
laughter
and
a
squeaky
voice
crying
out
that
boy
is
looking
for
a
pot
of
gold
ha
ha
but
little
does
he
know
that
a
whole
crock
full
is
lying
at
the
bottom
of
the
old
quarry
only
he
must
go
to
fetch
it
at
midnight
and
he
must
not
take
his
mother
with
when
the
lad
heard
this
he
hurried
home
and
told
his
mother
at
midnight
he
started
out
after
ordering
her
to
stay
in
the
house
but
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
she
thought
to
herself
i
ll
get
to
the
quarry
before
he
does
and
find
and
keep
the
gold
so
she
ran
by
a
shorter
way
and
when
she
reached
the
edge
of
the
quarry
she
slipped
on
a
stone
fell
to
the
bottom
and
broke
her
leg
and
there
she
lay
groaning
dreadfully
soon
the
lad
came
along
and
just
as
he
was
going
to
climb
down
he
heard
some
one
groan
what
s
below
he
cried
in
a
fright
is
it
evil
is
it
good
it
s
your
mother
with
a
broken
leg
groaned
she
and
is
this
my
pot
of
gold
exclaimed
the
lad
angrily
and
with
that
he
ran
for
a
neighbour
and
together
they
drew
the
woman
up
and
took
her
home
and
from
that
day
on
she
was
lame
as
for
the
leprechaun
he
is
still
sitting
under
the
and
he
laughs
at
the
lad
and
his
mother
as
he
mends
his
little
shoes
with
his
tiny
hammer
rip
rap
tick
tack
but
they
are
afraid
to
touch
him
for
they
know
he
can
punish
them
badly
tom
and
the
knockers
from
the
time
that
tom
was
old
enough
to
handle
pick
and
shovel
he
had
worked
in
the
tin
mines
and
very
lucky
he
was
always
finding
rich
lodes
of
tin
or
stumbling
on
heaps
of
cornish
diamonds
that
some
unknown
hands
had
piled
up
to
carry
off
one
night
tom
was
working
hard
in
an
old
mine
a
very
ancient
mine
indeed
when
he
heard
sounds
like
those
of
tiny
shovels
and
picks
tis
the
knockers
said
tom
to
himself
and
he
listened
quietly
then
he
heard
as
if
only
two
or
three
yards
away
little
miners
doing
all
sorts
of
underground
work
some
were
wheeling
barrows
others
were
shovelling
and
he
could
distinguish
even
the
sounds
of
boring
swabbing
the
holes
and
blasting
the
noises
came
nearer
and
nearer
and
tom
heard
distinctly
many
squeaky
voices
all
talking
at
once
and
strange
cackling
laughter
he
grew
quite
savage
listening
to
all
this
clatter
and
to
the
squeaking
and
and
being
a
rash
fellow
he
struck
the
wall
before
him
violently
with
his
pick
and
threw
a
handful
of
stones
in
the
direction
where
the
knockers
seemed
to
be
working
scat
he
shouted
or
i
ll
beat
your
brains
out
i
will
if
you
don
t
leave
here
the
words
were
scarcely
out
of
his
mouth
when
a
shower
of
stones
fell
all
around
him
and
on
him
and
frightened
him
nearly
out
of
his
senses
still
he
was
resolved
to
work
there
until
morning
and
so
he
kept
on
using
his
pick
for
about
an
hour
then
as
his
candle
was
burned
out
he
stopped
lit
another
and
sat
down
to
eat
his
breakfast
he
had
almost
finished
his
bread
and
cheese
when
he
heard
many
little
squeaking
voices
some
far
away
and
others
close
to
him
crying
out
tom
tom
leave
us
a
bite
of
your
breakfast
or
bad
luck
to
you
tom
at
first
he
could
not
make
out
the
words
only
his
own
name
then
the
cries
sounded
very
plain
and
he
was
angry
leave
the
little
rogues
a
bite
of
my
good
breakfast
thought
he
not
a
crumb
of
it
do
they
get
and
with
that
he
ate
the
last
morsel
then
he
heard
the
little
voices
squeaking
louder
than
before
tom
tom
we
ll
send
you
bad
luck
tom
you
greedy
creature
not
to
leave
a
single
crumb
for
the
knockers
and
they
kept
on
squeaking
and
in
a
mocking
way
but
getting
farther
and
farther
in
the
distance
until
they
were
quite
gone
then
tom
felt
tired
and
drowsy
and
lay
down
on
the
floor
to
sleep
awhile
when
he
waked
the
place
was
very
still
he
rubbed
his
eyes
and
saw
a
score
of
knockers
leaning
on
their
tools
and
standing
in
a
circle
around
him
they
were
little
withered
old
men
with
legs
like
and
arms
longer
and
thinner
than
their
legs
they
kept
nodding
their
great
ugly
heads
squinting
their
horrid
eyes
wriggling
their
hooked
noses
and
grinning
from
ear
to
ear
tom
lay
there
trembling
and
frightened
almost
to
death
then
the
oldest
and
ugliest
of
the
knockers
came
close
to
him
and
stooping
made
the
most
horrid
grimaces
in
tom
s
face
while
all
the
others
lolled
out
their
tongues
and
rolled
themselves
into
balls
and
grinned
at
him
from
between
their
then
tom
saw
that
his
candle
was
sputtering
and
just
going
out
and
he
sprang
to
his
feet
to
light
another
as
he
did
so
all
the
little
men
vanished
they
seemed
to
melt
away
one
into
the
other
like
puffs
of
smoke
feeling
very
stiff
and
tired
tom
mounted
the
ladders
and
left
the
mine
when
he
told
the
old
tinners
what
he
had
seen
they
were
not
surprised
for
it
was
well
known
among
them
that
the
mine
tom
had
been
working
in
was
the
abode
of
troops
of
knockers
but
the
tinners
one
and
all
blamed
tom
for
speaking
to
the
little
men
in
an
unfriendly
way
and
for
not
leaving
them
a
bite
of
his
breakfast
from
that
time
on
all
tom
s
luck
was
gone
the
mines
closed
down
and
his
money
went
and
he
was
hurt
by
a
fall
and
though
he
tried
hard
to
find
the
knockers
again
so
that
he
might
feed
them
well
he
never
saw
one
nor
even
heard
the
sounds
of
their
picks
and
shovels
in
the
mine
the
knockers
diamonds
jack
the
tinner
s
story
one
night
i
was
working
away
for
dear
life
in
yonder
old
tin
mine
i
was
in
good
heart
because
at
every
stroke
of
my
tool
i
heard
three
or
four
clicks
from
knockers
who
were
working
ahead
by
the
sounds
they
seemed
to
be
very
near
just
then
a
hard
stroke
of
my
pick
broke
open
the
rock
in
front
of
me
and
i
saw
into
a
large
grotto
the
light
of
my
candle
fell
on
its
walls
and
my
eyes
were
dazzled
by
the
glistening
of
bunches
of
diamonds
and
crystals
of
all
colours
that
hung
down
from
the
roof
and
encrusted
the
sides
while
i
was
rubbing
my
eyes
i
saw
three
little
knockers
they
were
no
bigger
than
sixpenny
dolls
yet
their
faces
were
old
and
strange
the
eldest
one
was
sitting
on
a
stone
his
jacket
off
and
his
rolled
up
between
his
knees
he
held
a
tiny
anvil
and
he
was
sharpening
a
borer
about
the
size
of
a
needle
for
one
of
the
knockers
the
third
little
fellow
was
awaiting
his
turn
in
hand
when
the
had
finished
sharpening
the
borer
he
rested
his
hammer
on
the
anvil
and
looked
toward
me
what
cheer
comrade
he
said
i
could
not
think
from
where
the
cold
wind
was
coming
the
draught
from
your
hole
has
blown
out
my
oh
is
that
you
how
are
you
said
i
and
how
is
the
rest
of
your
family
i
am
glad
to
see
you
i
ll
fetch
you
my
candle
in
a
minute
that
you
may
see
better
in
fact
i
ll
give
you
a
pound
of
candles
my
dear
with
all
my
heart
if
you
want
them
said
i
in
less
than
no
time
i
put
my
hand
through
the
hole
to
give
him
my
candle
when
what
do
you
think
there
wasn
t
a
knocker
in
sight
where
are
they
gone
thought
i
then
i
heard
them
somewhere
in
the
lode
ahead
and
cackling
and
squeaking
like
young
rabbits
and
there
i
was
left
in
their
pretty
workshop
with
bunches
of
diamonds
all
around
me
i
laid
my
coat
on
the
floor
and
filled
it
with
diamonds
and
coloured
crystals
and
then
hurried
out
of
the
mine
but
when
i
went
back
to
get
some
more
the
rocks
had
caved
in
and
i
never
could
find
the
grotto
again
skillywidden
every
one
knows
that
before
king
arthur
ruled
in
britain
the
danes
conquered
cornwall
then
many
of
the
rich
cornish
folk
buried
their
gold
and
treasures
and
fled
to
the
land
of
wales
a
few
years
after
that
king
arthur
came
with
his
knights
and
drove
the
danes
out
of
cornwall
then
the
folk
came
back
but
never
again
could
they
find
their
buried
treasures
and
none
but
the
spriggans
know
where
the
gold
is
hidden
well
one
morning
not
very
long
ago
uncle
billy
of
trevidga
was
out
on
the
side
of
a
hill
cutting
away
the
furze
that
was
as
high
as
his
head
with
bare
places
here
and
there
covered
with
white
clover
heath
and
whortleberries
uncle
billy
was
working
hard
when
he
spied
the
prettiest
little
creature
a
real
little
man
not
bigger
than
a
kitten
sleeping
on
a
bank
of
wild
thyme
he
was
dressed
in
a
green
coat
breeches
and
shoes
his
tiny
cocked
hat
was
drawn
over
his
face
to
shade
it
from
the
sun
uncle
billy
stooped
and
looked
at
him
and
longed
to
carry
him
home
to
his
children
for
he
had
a
houseful
of
little
ones
boys
and
girls
so
he
took
off
his
cuff
and
slipped
it
quickly
over
the
spriggan
for
a
spriggan
it
was
that
lay
there
before
he
could
wake
the
little
fellow
opened
his
pretty
eyes
and
said
in
a
sleepy
voice
mammy
where
are
you
mammy
daddy
then
he
saw
uncle
billy
looking
at
him
who
are
you
he
said
you
re
a
fine
great
giant
i
want
my
mammy
can
you
find
her
for
me
i
do
not
know
where
she
is
answered
uncle
billy
but
come
home
with
me
and
play
with
my
children
until
your
mammy
finds
very
well
said
the
spriggan
i
love
to
ride
goats
over
the
rocks
and
to
have
milk
and
blackberries
for
supper
will
you
give
me
some
yes
my
son
said
uncle
billy
and
with
that
he
picked
up
the
spriggan
gently
and
carried
him
home
well
you
should
have
seen
the
children
they
were
so
happy
to
own
a
spriggan
they
set
the
little
fellow
on
the
hearth
and
he
played
with
them
as
if
he
had
known
them
always
uncle
billy
and
his
wife
were
delighted
and
the
children
shouted
for
joy
when
the
pretty
little
man
capered
and
jumped
about
they
called
him
bobby
spriggan
twice
a
day
they
gave
him
a
wee
mug
of
milk
and
a
few
blackberries
and
now
and
then
some
haws
for
a
change
in
the
mornings
while
uncle
billy
s
wife
and
the
children
were
doing
the
housework
bobby
spriggan
sat
perched
on
the
faggots
in
the
and
sang
and
chirped
away
like
a
robin
redbreast
when
the
hearth
was
swept
and
the
kitchen
made
tidy
and
uncle
billy
s
wife
was
knitting
bobby
would
dance
for
hours
on
the
hearthstone
the
faster
her
needles
clicked
the
faster
he
danced
and
spun
around
and
around
and
the
children
laughed
and
clapped
their
hands
and
danced
with
him
a
week
or
so
after
bobby
spriggan
had
been
found
uncle
billy
had
to
leave
home
as
he
wished
to
keep
the
little
fellow
safe
and
sound
until
he
told
where
the
crocks
of
cornish
gold
were
hidden
uncle
billy
shut
him
up
with
the
youngest
children
in
the
barn
and
put
a
strong
padlock
on
the
door
now
stay
in
the
barn
and
play
called
uncle
billy
to
the
children
and
don
t
try
to
get
out
or
when
i
come
home
you
ll
get
a
walloping
said
he
and
then
went
away
the
children
laughed
a
part
of
the
time
and
a
part
of
the
time
they
cried
for
they
did
not
like
to
be
locked
in
the
barn
but
bobby
spriggan
was
as
merry
as
a
cricket
he
danced
and
sang
and
peeped
through
the
cracks
in
the
wall
at
the
men
who
were
working
in
the
fields
and
when
the
men
went
to
dinner
up
jumped
bobby
and
unbarred
a
window
come
along
children
he
cried
now
for
a
game
of
in
the
furze
then
he
sprang
out
the
window
and
the
children
followed
after
and
away
they
all
ran
to
play
in
the
furze
they
were
shouting
and
throwing
whortleberries
about
when
suddenly
they
saw
a
little
man
and
woman
no
bigger
than
bobby
the
little
man
was
dressed
like
bobby
except
that
he
wore
high
with
silver
spurs
the
little
woman
s
green
gown
was
spangled
with
glittering
stars
diamond
shone
on
her
shoes
and
her
tiny
hat
was
perched
on
a
pile
of
golden
curls
wreathed
with
heath
blossoms
the
pretty
little
soul
was
weeping
and
wringing
her
hands
and
crying
o
my
dear
tender
skillywidden
where
canst
thou
be
shall
i
never
set
eyes
on
thee
again
my
only
one
my
only
joy

cried
bobby
spriggan
to
the
children
then
he
called
out
here
i
am
mammy
and
just
as
he
said
here
i
am
the
little
man
and
the
little
woman
and
bobby
spriggan
himself
who
was
their
precious
skillywidden
vanished
and
were
seen
no
more
the
children
cried
and
cried
and
went
home
and
when
uncle
billy
came
back
you
may
be
sure
that
he
whipped
them
all
soundly
and
it
served
them
right
for
if
they
had
minded
and
stayed
in
the
barn
bobby
spriggan
would
have
shown

the
next
william
cartwright
little
redcap
sure
and
it
was
in
old
ireland
some
years
ago
that
tom
coghlan
returned
one
evening
to
his
house
expecting
to
find
the
fire
blazing
the
potatoes
boiling
and
his
wife
and
children
as
merry
as
grigs
but
instead
the
fire
was
out
his
wife
was
scolding
and
the
children
were
all
crying
from
hunger
poor
tom
was
quite
astonished
to
find
matters
going
on
so
badly
for
though
there
was
a
plenty
of
potatoes
in
the
house
there
wasn
t
a
single
stick
of
wood
for
the
fire
something
had
to
be
done
and
tom
bethought
himself
of
the
great
that
grew
around
the
ruins
of
the
old
fort
on
top
of
the
hill
so
he
snatched
up
his
axe
and
away
he
went
before
he
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
the
sun
had
gone
down
and
the
moon
had
risen
and
was
shedding
her
wavering
watery
light
on
the
ruins
of
the
old
fort
the
breeze
rustled
the
dark
with
an
eerie
sound
and
tom
shivered
with
dread
but
he
braced
up
his
heart
and
approaching
the
fort
raised
his
axe
to
cut
down
a
big
bush
just
then
near
him
he
heard
the
shriek
of
a
small
shrill
voice
tom
startled
let
the
axe
fall
from
his
grasp
and
looking
up
saw
perched
on
the
in
front
of
him
a
little
old
man
not
more
than
a
foot
and
a
half
high
he
wore
a
red
cap
his
face
was
the
colour
of
a
withered
mushroom
while
his
sparkling
eyes
twinkling
like
diamonds
in
the
dark
illuminated
his
distorted
face
his
thin
legs
dangled
from
his
fat
round
body
ho
ho
said
the
little
redcap
is
that
what
you
re
after
tom
coghlan
what
did
me
and
mine
ever
do
to
you
that
you
should
cut
down
our
bushes
why
then
nothing
at
all
your
honour
said
tom
recovering
a
bit
from
his
fright
nothing
at
all
only
the
children
were
crying
from
hunger
and
i
thought
i
d
make
bold
to
cut
a
bush
or
two
to
boil
the
potatoes
for
we
haven
t
a
stick
in
the
you
mustn
t
cut
down
these
bushes
tom
said
the
little
redcap
but
as
you
are
an
honest
man
i
ll
buy
them
from
you
though
i
have
a
better
right
to
them
than
you
have
so
if
you
ll
take
my
advice
carry
this
mill
home
with
you
and
let
the
bushes
alone
said
the
little
redcap
holding
out
a
tiny
stone
mill
for
grinding
meal
mill
indeed
said
tom
looking
with
astonishment
at
the
thing
which
was
so
small
that
he
could
have
put
it
with
ease
into
his
breeches
pocket
mill
indeed
and
what
good
will
a
bit
of
a
thing
like
that
do
me
sure
it
won
t
boil
the
potatoes
for
the
children
what
good
will
it
do
you
said
the
little
redcap
i
ll
tell
you
what
good
it
will
do
you
it
will
make
you
and
your
family
as
fat
and
strong
as
so
many
bullocks
and
if
it
won
t
boil
the
potatoes
it
will
do
a
great
deal
better
for
you
have
only
to
grind
it
and
it
will
give
you
the
greatest
plenty
of
elegant
meal
but
if
you
ever
sell
any
of
the
meal
that
moment
the
mill
will
lose
its
it
s
a
bargain
said
tom
so
give
me
the
mill
and
you
re
heartily
welcome
to
the
there
it
is
for
you
tom
said
the
little
redcap
throwing
the
mill
down
to
him
there
it
is
for
you
and
much
good
may
it
do
you
but
remember
you
are
not
to
sell
the
meal
on
any
let
me
alone
for
that
said
tom
and
then
he
made
the
best
of
his
way
home
where
his
wife
was
trying
to
comfort
the
children
wondering
all
the
time
what
in
the
world
was
keeping
tom
and
when
she
saw
him
return
without
so
much
as
one
stick
of
wood
to
boil
the
potatoes
her
anger
burst
out
but
tom
soon
quieted
her
by
placing
the
mill
on
the
table
and
telling
her
how
he
had
got
it
from
the
little
redcap
we
ll
try
it
directly
said
she
and
they
pulled
the
table
into
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
commenced
grinding
away
with
the
mill
before
long
a
stream
of
beautiful
meal
began
pouring
from
it
and
in
a
short
time
they
had
filled
every
dish
and
pail
in
the
house
tom
s
wife
was
delighted
as
you
may
believe
and
the
children
managed
the
best
they
could
for
that
night
by
eating
plenty
of
raw
meal
well
after
that
everything
went
very
well
with
tom
and
his
family
the
mill
gave
them
all
the
meal
they
wanted
and
they
grew
as
fat
and
sleek
as
but
one
morning
when
tom
was
away
from
home
his
wife
needed
money
so
she
took
a
few
pecks
of
the
meal
to
town
and
sold
it
in
the
market
and
sorry
enough
she
was
for
that
night
when
tom
came
home
and
began
to
grind
the
mill
not
a
speck
of
meal
would
come
from
it
he
could
not
for
the
life
of
him
find
out
the
reason
for
his
wife
was
afraid
to
tell
him
about
her
selling
the
meal
sure
and
the
little
old
fellow
cheated
me
well
thought
tom
as
mad
as
a
nest
of
hornets
so
he
put
his
axe
under
his
arm
and
away
he
went
to
the
old
fort
determined
to
punish
the
little
redcap
by
cutting
down
his
bushes
but
scarcely
had
he
lifted
his
axe
when
the
little
redcap
appeared
and
mighty
angry
he
was
too
that
tom
should
come
cutting
his
bushes
after
having
made
a
fair
bargain
with
him
you
deceitful
little
ugly
vagabond
cried
tom
flourishing
his
axe
to
give
me
a
mill
that
wasn
t
worth
a
sixpence
if
you
don
t
give
me
a
good
one
for
it
i
ll
cut
down
every
bush
what
a
blusterer
you
are
tom
said
the
little
redcap
but
you
d
better
be
easy
and
let
the
bushes
alone
or
maybe
you
ll
pay
for
it
deceive
you
indeed
didn
t
i
tell
you
that
mill
would
lose
its
power
if
you
sold
any
of
the
meal
and
sure
and
i
didn
t
either
said
tom
well
it
s
all
one
for
that
answered
the
little
redcap
for
if
you
didn
t
your
wife
did
and
as
to
giving
you
another
mill
it
s
out
of
the
question
for
the
one
i
gave
you
was
the
only
one
in
the
fort
and
a
hard
battle
we
had
to
get
it
away
from
another
party
of
the
good
people
but
i
ll
tell
you
what
i
ll
do
with
you
tom
let
the
bushes
alone
and
i
ll
make
a
doctor
of
a
doctor
indeed
said
tom
maybe
it
s
a
fool
you
re
making
of
me
but
it
was
no
such
thing
for
the
little
redcap
gave
tom
coghlan
a
charm
so
that
he
could
cure
any
sick
person
and
tom
took
it
home
and
became
a
great
man
with
a
very
full
purse
he
gave
good
schooling
to
his
children
one
of
them
he
made
a
grand
in
the
city
of
cork
and
the
youngest
son
being
ever
and
always
a
lad
he
made
a
lawyer
and
his
two
daughters
married
well
and
tom
is
as
happy
as
a
man
can
be
the
curmudgeon
s
skin
it
is
well
known
in
old
ireland
that
a
shamrock
has
the
power
to
open
a
man
s
eyes
so
that
he
can
see
all
kinds
of
enchantments
and
this
is
what
happened
to
billy
thompson
one
misfortune
after
another
decreased
his
goods
his
sheep
died
and
his
pig
got
the
measles
so
that
he
was
obliged
to
sell
it
for
little
or
nothing
but
still
he
had
his
cow
well
said
billy
to
his
wife
for
he
was
a
fellow
and
always
made
the
best
of
things
well
said
he
it
can
t
be
helped
anyhow
we
ll
not
want
the
drop
of
milk
to
our
potatoes
as
long
as
the
cow
s
left
to
comfort
us
the
words
were
hardly
out
of
his
mouth
when
a
neighbour
came
running
up
to
tell
him
that
his
cow
had
fallen
from
a
cliff
and
was
lying
dead
in
the
horses
glen
for
billy
you
must
know
had
sent
his
cow
that
very
morning
to
graze
on
the
cliff
och
ullagone
cried
billy
what
ll
we
do
now
och
you
cruel
unnatural
beast
as
to
clift
yourself
when
you
knowed
as
well
as
myself
that
we
couldn
t
do
without
you
at
all
for
sure
enough
now
the
children
will
be
crying
for
the
drop
of
milk
to
their
potatoes
such
was
billy
s
lament
as
with
a
sorrowful
heart
he
made
the
best
of
his
way
to
the
horses
glen
anyway
thought
he
i
ll
skin
the
carcass
and
the
meat
will
make
fine
broth
for
the
it
took
him
some
time
to
find
where
the
poor
beast
was
lying
but
at
last
he
did
find
her
all
smashed
to
pieces
at
the
foot
of
a
big
rock
and
he
began
to
skin
her
as
fast
as
he
could
but
having
no
one
to
help
him
by
the
time
the
job
was
finished
the
sun
had
gone
down
now
billy
was
so
intent
on
his
work
that
he
did
not
perceive
the
lapse
of
time
but
when
he
raised
his
head
and
saw
the
darkness
coming
on
and
listened
to
the
murmuring
wind
all
the
tales
he
had
ever
heard
of
the
pooka
the
banshee
and
little
redcap
the
mischievous
fairy
floated
through
his
mind
and
made
him
want
to
get
home
as
fast
as
possible
he
snatched
a
tuft
of
grass
wiped
his
knife
and
seized
hold
of
the
hide
it
so
happened
that
in
the
little
tuft
of
grass
with
which
billy
wiped
his
knife
was
a
shamrock
and
whether
from
grief
or
fear
billy
instead
of
throwing
away
the
grass
put
it
in
his
pocket
along
with
his
knife
and
when
he
stood
up
and
turned
to
take
a
last
look
at
the
carcass
he
saw
instead
of
his
poor
cow
a
little
old
curmudgeon
sitting
bolt
upright
looking
as
if
he
had
just
been
skinned
alive

cried
the
little
old
fellow
in
a
shrill
squeaking
voice
you
spalpeen
you
d
better
come
back
with
my
skin
a
pretty
time
of
day
we
ve
come
to
when
a
gentleman
like
me
can
not
take
a
bit
of
sleep
but
a
rude
fellow
must
come
and
strip
the
hide
off
him
but
you
d
better
bring
it
back
billy
thompson
or
i
ll
make
you
remember
how
you
dared
to
skin
me
you
spalpeen
now
billy
though
he
was
greatly
frightened
remembered
that
he
had
a
knife
in
his
pocket
and
whoever
has
that
tis
said
can
look
all
the
fairies
of
the
world
in
the
face
without
quaking
so
he
put
his
hand
on
the
knife
and
began
backing
away
with
the
skin
under
his
arm
why
then
your
honour
said
he
if
it
s
this
skin
you
re
wanting
you
must
know
it
s
the
skin
of
my
poor
cow
that
was
clifted
yonder
there
and
sore
and
sorrowful
the
children
will
be
for
the
want
of
her
little
drop
of
milk
why
then
if
that
s
what
you
d
be
after
billy
my
boy
said
the
little
fellow
at
the
same
time
jumping
before
him
with
the
speed
of
a
greyhound
do
you
think
i
m
such
a
fool
as
to
let
you
walk
off
with
my
skin
if
you
don
t
drop
it
in
the
turn
of
a
hand
you
ll
sup
sorrow
nonsense
said
billy
drawing
out
his
knife
and
holding
it
so
the
little
man
could
see
it
never
a
one
of
me
will
let
you
have
this
skin
till
you
give
me
back
my
cow
i
know
well
enough
she
was
not
clifted
at
all
at
all
and
that
you
and
the
other
curmudgeons
have
got
hold
of
her
you
d
better
keep
a
civil
tongue
in
your
head
said
the
little
fellow
who
seemed
to
get
quite
soft
at
the
sight
of
the
knife
but
you
re
a
brave
boy
billy
thompson
and
i
ve
taken
a
fancy
to
you
i
don
t
say
but
i
might
get
you
your
cow
again
if
you
ll
give
me
back
my
thank
you
kindly
said
billy
winking
slyly
give
me
the
cow
first
then
i
well
there
she
is
for
you
you
unbelieving
hound
said
the
little
curmudgeon
and
for
sure
and
for
certain
what
did
billy
thompson
hear
but
his
own
cow
bellowing
behind
him
for
the
bare
life
and
when
he
looked
back
what
should
he
see
but
his
cow
running
over
rocks
and
stones
with
a
long
rope
hanging
to
one
of
her
legs
and
four
little
fellows
with
red
caps
on
them
hunting
her
as
fast
as
they
could
there
ll
be
a
battle
for
her
billy
there
ll
be
a
battle
laughed
the
little
curmudgeon
and
sure
enough
the
little
redcaps
began
to
fight
and
in
the
meantime
the
cow
finding
herself
at
liberty
ran
towards
billy
who
lost
not
a
minute
but
throwing
the
skin
on
the
ground
seized
the
cow
by
the
tail
and
began
to
drive
her
away
not
so
fast
billy
said
the
little
curmudgeon
who
stuck
close
by
his
side
not
so
fast
though
i
gave
you
the
cow
i
didn
t
give
you
the
rope
that
s
hanging
to
her
a
bargain
s
a
bargain
said
billy
so
as
i
ve
got
it
i
ll
keep
rope
and
if
you
say
that
again
said
the
little
fellow
i
ll
be
after
calling
the
redcaps
that
are
fighting
below
there
but
i
don
t
want
to
be
too
hard
on
you
billy
for
if
you
have
a
mind
for
the
rope
i
ll
give
it
to
you
for
the
little
tuft
of
grass
you
have
in
your
there
take
it
said
billy
throwing
down
the
grass
with
the
shamrock
in
it
no
sooner
was
it
out
of
his
hand
than
he
received
such
a
blow
that
it
dashed
him
to
the
ground
insensible
when
he
came
to
himself
the
sun
was
shining
and
where
should
he
be
but
near
his
own
house
with
the
cow
grazing
beside
him
billy
thompson
could
hardly
believe
his
eyes
and
thought
it
was
all
a
dream
till
he
saw
the
rope
hanging
to
his
cow
s
leg
and
that
was
a
lucky
rope
for
him
for
from
that
day
out
his
cow
gave
more
milk
than
any
six
cows
in
the
parish
and
billy
began
to
look
up
in
the
world
he
took
farms
and
purchased
cattle
till
he
became
very
rich
but
no
one
could
ever
get
him
to
go
to
the
horses
glen
and
he
never
passes
an
old
fort
or
hears
a
blast
of
wind
without
taking
off
his
hat
in
compliment
to
the
good
people
and
tis
only
right
that
he
should
judy
and
the
fairy
cat
late
one
hallowe
en
an
old
woman
was
sitting
up
spinning
there
came
a
soft
knock
at
the
door
who
s
there
asked
she
there
was
no
answer
but
another
knock
who
s
there
she
asked
a
second
time
still
no
answer
but
a
third
knock
at
that
the
old
woman
got
up
in
anger
who
s
there
she
cried
a
small
voice
like
a
child
s
sobbed
ah
judy
dear
let
me
in
i
am
so
cold
and
hungry
open
the
door
judy
dear
and
let
me
sit
by
the
fire
and
dry
myself
judy
dear
let
me
in
oh
let
me
in
judy
thinking
that
it
must
be
a
small
child
who
had
lost
its
way
ran
to
the
door
and
opened
it
in
walked
a
large
black
cat
waving
her
tail
and
two
black
kittens
followed
her
they
walked
deliberately
across
the
floor
and
sat
down
before
the
fire
and
began
to
warm
themselves
and
lick
their
fur
purring
all
the
time
judy
never
said
a
word
but
closed
the
door
and
went
back
to
her
spinning
at
last
the
black
cat
spoke
judy
dear
said
she
do
not
sit
up
so
late
this
is
the
fairies
holiday
and
they
wish
to
hold
a
counsel
in
your
kitchen
and
eat
their
supper
here
they
are
very
angry
because
you
are
still
up
and
they
can
not
come
in
indeed
judy
they
are
determined
to
kill
you
only
for
myself
and
my
two
daughters
you
would
now
be
dead
so
take
my
advice
and
do
not
interfere
with
the
fairies
hallowe
en
but
give
me
some
milk
for
i
must
be
well
judy
got
up
in
a
great
fright
and
ran
as
fast
as
she
could
and
brought
three
saucers
full
of
milk
and
set
them
on
the
floor
before
the
cats
they
lapped
up
all
the
milk
then
the
black
cat
called
her
daughters
and
stood
up
thank
you
judy
dear
she
said
you
have
been
very
civil
to
me
and
i
ll
not
forget
good
night
good
night
and
with
that
she
and
her
kittens
whisked
up
the
chimney
and
were
gone
then
judy
saw
something
shining
on
the
hearth
she
picked
it
up
it
was
a
piece
of
silver
money
more
than
she
could
earn
in
a
month
she
put
out
the
light
and
went
to
bed
and
never
again
did
she
sit
up
late
on
hallowe
en
and
interfere
with
fairy
hours
the
boggart
once
upon
a
time
a
boggart
lived
in
a
farmer
s
house
he
was
a
mischievous
elf
and
specially
fond
of
teasing
the
children
when
they
were
eating
their
supper
he
would
make
himself
invisible
and
standing
back
of
their
chairs
would
snatch
away
their
bread
and
butter
and
drain
their
mugs
of
milk
on
cold
nights
he
would
pull
the
clothes
from
their
warm
beds
and
tickle
their
feet
and
the
children
liked
to
tease
the
boggart
in
return
there
was
a
closet
in
the
kitchen
with
a
large
in
its
wall
behind
which
the
boggart
lived
the
children
used
to
stick
a
shoehorn
into
the
hole
and
the
boggart
would
throw
it
back
at
them
the
shoehorn
made
the
little
man
so
angry
that
one
day
he
threw
it
at
the
youngest
boy
s
head
and
hurt
him
badly
at
length
the
boggart
became
such
a
torment
that
the
farmer
and
his
wife
decided
to
move
to
another
place
and
let
the
mischievous
creature
have
their
house
to
himself
the
day
of
the
moving
came
all
the
furniture
was
piled
into
a
wagon
and
a
neighbour
called
to
say
so
farmer
said
he
you
are
leaving
the
old
house
at
last
sighed
the
farmer
i
am
forced
to
do
it
that
villain
boggart
torments
us
so
that
we
have
no
rest
night
or
day
he
almost
killed
my
youngest
boy
so
you
see
we
are
forced
to
scarcely
were
the
words
out
of
his
mouth
when
a
squeaky
voice
cried
from
the
bottom
of
the
churn
that
was
in
the
wagon
aye
aye
we
re
flitting
you
see
ods
hang
it
cried
the
poor
farmer
there
is
that
villain
boggart
again
if
he
s
going
along
with
us
i
shall
not
stir
a
peg
nay
nay
it
s
no
use
molly
said
he
turning
to
his
wife
we
may
as
well
stay
here
in
the
old
house
as
to
be
tormented
in
the
new
one
that
is
not
so
convenient
and
they
stayed
ownself
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
widow
and
her
little
boy
their
home
was
a
small
cottage
in
the
wood
the
mother
worked
hard
from
early
morning
until
evening
and
she
was
so
tired
that
she
liked
to
go
to
bed
early
but
the
little
boy
did
not
like
to
go
to
bed
early
at
all
one
evening
when
his
mother
told
him
to
undress
he
begged
her
saying
i
m
not
sleepy
may
i
sit
up
just
this
once
very
well
said
she
sit
up
if
you
wish
but
if
the
fairies
catch
you
here
alone
they
will
surely
carry
you
then
she
went
to
bed
the
little
boy
laughed
and
sat
down
on
the
hearth
before
the
fire
watching
the
blaze
and
warming
his
hands
by
and
by
he
heard
a
giggling
and
a
laughing
in
the
chimney
and
the
next
minute
he
saw
a
tiny
girl
as
big
as
a
doll
come
tumbling
down
and
jump
on
to
the
hearth
in
front
of
him
at
first
the
little
boy
was
dreadfully
frightened
but
the
tiny
girl
began
to
dance
so
prettily
and
to
nod
her
head
at
him
in
such
a
friendly
way
that
he
forgot
to
be
afraid
what
do
they
call
you
little
girl
said
he
my
name
is
ownself
said
she
proudly
what
is
yours
my
name
he
answered
laughing
very
hard
is
my
then
the
two
children
began
to
play
together
as
if
they
had
known
each
other
all
their
lives
they
danced
and
they
sang
and
they
roasted
chestnuts
before
the
fire
and
they
tickled
the
s
ears
then
the
fire
commenced
to
flicker
and
it
grew
dimmer
and
dimmer
so
the
little
boy
took
the
poker
and
stirred
up
the
embers
and
a
hot
coal
tumbled
out
and
rolled
on
to
ownself
s
tiny
foot
and
oh
how
she
screamed
then
she
wept
and
flew
into
such
a
rage
that
the
little
boy
got
frightened
and
hid
behind
the
door
just
then
a
squeaky
voice
called
down
the
chimney
ownself
ownself
what
wicked
creature
hurt
you
my
ownself
my
ownself
she
screamed
back
then
come
here
you
troublesome
little
fairy
cried
the
voice
angrily
and
a
fairy
mother
slipper
in
hand
came
hurrying
down
the
chimney
and
catching
ownself
she
whipped
her
soundly
and
carried
her
off
saying
what
s
all
this
noise
about
then
if
you
did
it
your
ownself
there
s
nobody
to
blame
but
yourself
the
elves
wang
lay
stretched
on
his
bed
of
bamboo
laths
where
a
low
fever
kept
him
he
complained
to
every
one
especially
to
his
friend
the
magician
who
came
to
see
him
the
magician
was
very
wise
so
he
gave
wang
a
drink
of
something
delicious
and
cool
and
went
away
when
had
drunk
this
his
fever
fell
and
he
was
able
to
enjoy
a
little
sleep
he
was
awakened
by
a
slight
noise
the
night
was
come
the
room
was
lighted
by
the
full
moon
which
threw
a
bright
gleam
through
the
open
door
then
he
saw
that
the
room
was
full
of
insects
that
were
moving
and
flying
hither
and
thither
there
were
white
ants
that
gnaw
wood
bugs
enormous
cockroaches
mosquitoes
and
many
many
flies
and
they
were
all
buzzing
gnashing
their
teeth
or
falling
as
looked
he
saw
something
move
on
the
threshold
a
small
man
not
bigger
than
a
thumb
advanced
with
cautious
steps
in
his
hand
he
held
a
bow
a
sword
was
hanging
by
his
side
looking
closer
saw
two
dogs
as
big
as
running
in
front
of
the
little
man
they
suddenly
stopped
the
archer
approached
nearer
to
the
bed
and
held
out
his
bow
and
discharged
a
tiny
arrow
a
cockroach
that
was
crawling
before
the
dogs
made
a
bound
fell
on
its
back
kicked
and
was
motionless
the
arrow
had
run
through
it
behind
the
little
man
other
little
men
had
come
some
rode
on
small
horses
and
were
armed
with
swords
and
still
others
were
on
foot
all
these
huntsmen
scattered
about
the
room
and
ran
or
rode
to
and
fro
shooting
arrows
and
brandishing
their
swords
until
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
insects
were
killed
at
first
the
mosquitoes
escaped
but
as
they
can
not
fly
for
long
every
time
one
of
them
settled
on
the
wall
it
was
transfixed
by
a
huntsman
soon
none
were
left
of
all
the
insects
that
had
broken
the
silence
with
their
buzzing
their
gnashing
of
teeth
and
their
falling
a
horseman
then
galloped
around
the
room
looking
from
right
to
left
he
gave
a
signal
all
the
huntsmen
called
their
dogs
went
to
the
door
and
disappeared
had
not
moved
for
fear
that
he
should
disturb
the
hunt
at
last
he
went
peacefully
to
sleep
and
woke
the
next
day
cured
when
his
friend
the
magician
came
to
see
him
told
him
about
the
mysterious
huntsmen
and
his
friend
the
magician
smiled
how

and
walked
to

she
bought
the
goods
and
started
for
home
it
was
a
bright
moonlight
night
and
though
no
wind
was
blowing
the
leaves
of
the
trees
were
murmuring
with
a
hollow
sound
and
kate
could
hear
strange
rustlings
in
the
bushes
by
the
side
of
the
road
she
had
walked
a
very
long
time
and
her
basket
was
so
heavy
that
she
began
to
feel
tired
her
legs
bent
under
her
and
she
could
scarcely
stand
up
just
then
she
beheld
a
little
in

of
her
a

on

the
proud
way

him
how
she
had
walked
to
penzance
and
was
now
so
tired
that
she
could
not
stand
up
but
the
gentleman
made
no
reply
my
dear
master
said
she
i
m
footsore
and
i
ve
got
as
far
as
here
you
see
but
i
can
get
no
farther
do
have
pity
on
a
poor
unfortunate
woman
and
take
her
behind
you
i
can
ride
well
enough
on
your
horse
s
back
without
a
saddle
or
but
still
the
gentleman
made
no
reply
my
dear
master
she
said
again
my
but
you
re
a
man
how
upright
you
sit
on
your
horse
but
why
don
t
you
answer
me
are
you
asleep
one
would
think
you
were
taking
a
nap
and
your
horse
too
it
is
standing
so
still
not
having
any
word
in
reply
to
this
fine
speech
kate
called
out
as
loud
as
she
could
even
if
you
are
a
you
needn
t
be
so
that
you
won
t
speak
to
a
poor
body
afoot
still
he
never
spoke
though
kate
thought
that
she
saw
him
wink
at
her
this
vexed
her
the
more
the
time
was
when
the
tregeers
were
among
the
first
in
the
parish
and
were
buried
with
the
gentry
wake
up
and
speak
to
me
screamed
she
in
a
rage
and
then
she
took
up
a
stone
and
threw
it
at
the
horse
the
stone
rolled
back
to
her
feet
and
the
animal
did
not
even
whisk
its
tail
kate
now
got
nearer
and
saw
that
the
rider
had
no
hat
on
nor
was
there
any
hair
on
his
bald
head
she
touched
the
horse
and
felt
nothing
but
a
bunch
of
furze
she
rubbed
her
eyes
and
saw
at
once
to
her
great
astonishment
that
it
was
no
gentleman
and
horse
at
all
only
a
smooth
stone
half
buried
in
a
heap
of
furze
and
there
she
was
still
far
away
from
pendeen
with
her
heavy
basket
and
her
legs
so
tired
that
she
could
scarcely
move
and
then
she
saw
that
she
had
come
a
short
distance
only
and
knew
that
she
must
be
bewitched
well
on
she
went
and
seeing
a
light
at
her
left
hand
she
thought
that
it
shone
from
the
window
of
a
house
where
she
might
rest
awhile
so
she
made
for
it
straight
across
the
moor
floundering
through
bogs
and
tripping
over
bunches
of
furze
and
still
the
light
was
always
just
ahead
and
it
seemed
to
move
from
side
to
side
then
suddenly
it
went
out
and
she
was
left
standing
in
a
bog
the
next
minute
she
found
herself
among
and
pigsties
in
the
yard
of
farmer
boslow
miles
away
from
pendeen
she
opened
the
door
of
an
old
outhouse
and
entered
hoping
to
get
a
few
hours
rest
there
she
lay
down
on
straw
and
fell
asleep
but
she
was
soon
wakened
by
some
young
pigs
who
were
rooting
around
in
the
straw
that
was
too
much
for
kate
so
up
she
got
and
as
she
did
so
she
heard
the
noise
of
a
flail
and
seeing
a
glimmer
of
light
in
a
barn
near
by
she
crept
softly
to
a
little
window
in
the
barn
and
peeped
to
find
what
was
going
on
at
first
she
could
see
only
two
burning
in
two
old
iron
lamps
then
through
the
dim
light
she
saw
the
of
a
flail
as
it
rose
and
fell
and
beat
the
barn
floor
she
stood
on
tiptoes
and
stuck
her
head
in
farther
and
whom
did
she
see
wielding
the
flail
but
a
little
old
man
about
three
feet
high
with
hair
like
a
bunch
of
rushes
and
ragged
clothes
his
face
was
broader
than
it
was
long
and
he
had
great
shaded
by
heavy
eyebrows
from
which
his
nose
poked
like
a
pig
s
snout
kate
noticed
that
his
teeth
were
crooked
and
jagged
and
that
at
each
stroke
of
the
flail
he
kept
moving
his
thin
lips
around
and
around
and
thrusting
his
tongue
in
and
out
his
shoulders
were
broad
enough
for
a
man
twice
his
height
and
his
feet
were
splayed
like
a
frog
s
well
well
thought
kate
this
is
luck
to
see
the
piskey
threshing
for
ever
since
i
can
remember
i
have
heard
it
said
that
the
piskey
threshed
corn
for
farmer
boslow
on
winter
nights
and
did
other
odd
jobs
for
him
the
year
round
but
i
would
not
believe
it
yet
here
he
is
then
she
reached
her
head
farther
in
and
beheld
a
score
of
little
men
helping
the
piskey
some
of
them
were
lugging
down
the
sheaves
and
placing
them
handy
for
him
and
others
were
carrying
away
the
straw
from
which
the
grain
had
been
threshed
soon
a
heap
of
corn
was
gathered
on
the
floor
as
clean
as
if
it
had
been
winnowed
in
doing
this
the
piskey
raised
such
a
dust
that
it
set
him
and
some
of
the
little
men
sneezing
and
kate
without
stopping
to
think
called
out
god
bless
you
little
men
quick
as
a
wink
the
lights
vanished
and
a
handful
of
dust
was
thrown
into
her
eyes
which
blinded
her
so
that
for
a
moment
she
could
not
see
and
then
she
heard
the
piskey
squeak
spy
thy
face
old
peeping
kate
i
ll
serve
thee
out
early
and
late
kate
when
she
heard
this
felt
very
uneasy
for
she
remembered
that
the
little
people
have
a
great
spite
against
any
one
who
peeps
at
them
or
pries
into
their
doings
the
night
being
clear
she
quickly
found
her
way
out
of
a
crooked
lane
and
ran
as
fast
as
she
could
and
never
stopped
until
she
reached
the
gump
there
she
sat
down
to
rest
awhile
after
that
she
stood
up
and
turn
whichever
way
she
might
the
same
road
lay
before
her
then
she
knew
that
the
piskey
was
playing
her
a
trick
so
she
ran
down
a
hill
as
fast
as
she
could
not
caring
in
what
direction
she
was
going
so
long
as
she
could
get
away
from
the
piskey
after
running
a
long
while
she
heard
music
and
saw
lights
at
no
great
distance
thinking
that
she
must
be
near
a
house
she
went
over
the
downs
toward
the
lights
feeling
ready
for
a
jig
and
stopping
now
and
then
to
dance
around
and
around
to
the
strains
of
the
music
but
instead
of
arriving
at
a
house
in
passing
around
some
high
rocks
she
came
out
on
a
broad
green
meadow
encircled
with
furze
and
rocks
and
there
before
her
she
saw
a
whole
troop
of
spriggans
holding
an
elfin
fair
it
was
like
a
scores
of
little
booths
were
standing
in
rows
and
were
covered
with
tiny
trinkets
such
as
buckles
of
silver
and
gold
glistening
with
cornish
diamonds
pins
with
jewelled
heads
brooches
rings
bracelets
and
necklaces
of
crystal
beads
green
and
red
or
blue
and
gold
and
many
other
pretty
things
new
to
kate
there
were
lights
in
all
directions
lanterns
no
bigger
than
foxgloves
were
hanging
in
rows
and
on
the
booths
rushlights
in
shone
among
fairy
goodies
such
as
kate
had
never
dreamed
of
yet
with
all
these
lights
there
was
such
a
shimmer
over
everything
that
she
got
bewildered
and
could
not
see
as
plainly
as
she
wished
she
did
not
care
to
disturb
the
little
people
until
she
had
looked
at
all
that
was
doing
so
she
crept
softly
behind
the
booths
and
watched
the
spriggans
dancing
hundreds
of
them
linked
hand
in
hand
went
whirling
around
so
fast
as
to
make
her
dizzy
small
as
they
were
they
were
all
decked
out
like
rich
folk
the
little
men
in
cocked
hats
and
feathers
blue
coats
gay
with
lace
and
gold
buttons
breeches
and
stockings
of
lighter
hue
and
tiny
shoes
with
diamond
buckles
kate
could
not
name
the
colours
of
the
little
ladies
dresses
which
were
of
all
the
hues
of
summer
blossoms
the
vain
little
things
had
powdered
their
hair
and
decked
their
heads
with
ribbons
feathers
and
flowers
their
shoes
were
of
velvet
and
satin
and
were
and
pointed
and
such
sparkling
black
eyes
as
all
the
little
ladies
had
and
such
dimpled
cheeks
and
chins
and
they
were
merry
sprightly
and
laughing
all
the
spriggans
were
capering
and
dancing
around
a
pole
wreathed
with
flowers
the
pipers
standing
in
their
midst
played
such
lively
airs
that
kate
never
in
all
her
life
had
wanted
to
dance
more
but
she
kept
quite
still
for
she
did
not
wish
the
little
people
to
know
that
she
was
there
she
was
determined
to
pocket
some
of
the
pretty
things
in
the
booths
and
steal
softly
away
with
them
she
thought
how
nice
a
bright
pair
of
diamond
buckles
would
look
on
her
best
shoes
and
how
fine
her
sunday
cap
would
be
ornamented
with
a
fairy
brooch
so
she
raised
her
hand
and
laid
it
on
some
buckles
when
oh
oh
she
felt
a
palmful
of
pins
and
needles
stick
into
her
fingers
like
points
and
she
screamed
misfortune
take
you
you
bad
little
spriggans
illustration
she
saw
a
whole
troop
of
spriggans
holding
an
elfin
fair
immediately
the
lights
went
out
and
she
felt
hundreds
of
the
little
people
leap
on
her
back
and
her
neck
and
her
head
at
the
same
moment
others
tripped
up
her
heels
and
laid
her
flat
on
the
ground
and
rolled
her
over
and
over
then
she
caught
sight
of
the
piskey
mounted
on
a
colt
his
toes
stuck
in
its
mane
he
was
holding
a
rush
for
a
whip
and
there
he
sat
grinning
from
ear
to
ear
and
urging
on
the
spriggans
to
torment
her
with
haw
haw
haw
and
tee
hee
hee
she
spread
out
her
arms
and
squeezed
herself
tight
to
the
ground
so
that
the
spriggans
might
not
turn
her
over
but
they
squeaked
and
grunted
and
over
and
over
she
went
and
every
time
that
they
turned
her
face
downward
some
of
the
little
fellows
jumped
on
her
back
and
jigged
away
from
her
toe
to
her
head
she
reached
around
to
beat
them
off
with
a
stick
but
they
pulled
it
out
of
her
hand
and
balancing
it
across
her
body
strided
it
and
bobbed
up
and
down
singing
lie
still
old
peeping
kate
here
we
ll
ride
early
and
late
on
the
back
of
peeping
kate
and
with
that
poor
kate
not
to
be
beaten
by
the
spriggans
tossed
back
her
feet
to
kick
the
little
fellows
away
but
they
pulled
off
her
shoes
and
tickled
and
prickled
the
soles
of
her
feet
until
she
fell
and
by
turns
kate
was
almost
mad
with
their
torment
when
by
good
chance
she
remembered
a
charm
that
would
drive
away
all
mischievous
spirits
on
hallowe
en
so
she
repeated
it
forwards
and
backwards
and
in
a
twinkling
all
the
little
spriggans
fled
screeching
away
the
piskey
galloping
after
them
then
she
got
on
her
feet
and
looked
around
she
saw
by
the
starlight
of
a
clear
frosty
morning
that
the
place
to
which
she
had
been
was
a
green
spot
near
the
gump
where
folks
said
the
spriggans
held
their
nightly
revels
and
although
the
spot
was
very
small
it
had
seemed
to
her
like
a
field
because
of
enchantment
and
her
hat
and
her
shoes
and
her
basket
were
gone
and
poor
kate
barefooted
and
bareheaded
had
to
hobble
home
as
best
she
could
and
she
reached
pendeen
gate
more
dead
than
alive
prying
joan
s
tale
sit
down
bobby
my
boy
eat
some
bread
and
cheese
don
t
be
afraid
to
drink
the
cider
it
s
all
my
own
making
sit
down
and
i
ll
tell
you
how
i
lost
the
sight
of
my
right
eye
the
last
christmas
eve
i
went
to
penzance
to
buy
a
pair
of
shoes
for
myself
and
some
thread
and
buttons
and
things
to
mend
master
s
clothes
i
dearly
like
company
and
as
i
started
out
i
thought
of
old
betty
down
at
the
cove
she
that
they
say
is
a
witch
you
know
thinks
i
to
myself
if
she
s
a
witch
she
ll
not
hurt
me
as
i
never
crossed
her
in
my
life
witch
or
no
witch
i
ll
stop
and
have
a
bite
of
something
hot
at
her
little
house
thought
i
when
i
came
to
the
house
the
door
was
tight
shut
and
i
heard
a
strange
mumbling
inside
but
i
could
not
make
out
what
it
was
so
i
took
a
peep
through
the
and
what
did
i
see
but
old
betty
standing
by
the
with
a
little
box
in
her
hand
and
she
was
muttering
something
that
sounded
like
a
charm
she
put
her
finger
into
the
box
and
pulled
it
out
again
and
smeared
some
ointment
over
her
eyes
then
she
put
the
box
into
a
hole
near
the
chimney
i
lifted
the
latch
and
walked
in
betty
said
i
welcome
said
she
grinning
and
pleased
sit
down
by
the
fire
now
we
ll
have
a
good
drop
of
something
hot
to
ourselves
seeing
that
it
s
christmas
eve
said
she
i
ll
take
a
thimbleful
just
to
drink
your
health
and
a
merry
christmas
to
you
with
all
my
heart
said
i
for
i
well
knew
that
betty
made
the
best
sweet
drink
with
sugar
and
spice
and
a
roasted
apple
bobbing
around
in
it
i
put
down
my
basket
and
took
off
my
coat
and
sat
by
the
fire
while
betty
stepped
into
a
closet
to
fetch
the
cups
now
i
had
often
wondered
what
made
her
eyes
so
clear
and
piercing
tis
the
fairy
ointment
or
witch
salve
in
the
box
thought
i
if
it
will
do
that
to
her
eyes
it
won
t
hurt
so
while
she
was
gone
i
took
the
box
from
the
hole
where
she
had
covered
it
with
ferns
and
put
a
bit
of
the
ointment
on
my
right
eye
the
stuff
had
no
sooner
touched
me
than
it
burned
like
fire
or
as
if
needles
and
pins
were
being
thrust
into
my
eyeball
just
then
betty
came
from
the
closet
and
i
dragged
the
brim
of
my
hat
down
over
my
right
eye
so
she
should
not
see
what
had
happened
after
we
had
drunk
each
other
s
health
three
or
four
times
the
pain
went
off
and
i
ventured
to
open
my
anointed
eye
and
oh
what
did
i
see
the
place
was
full
of
spriggans
troops
of
the
little
people
were
cutting
all
sorts
of
capers
in
the
folds
of
the
nets
and
sails
hung
on
the
walls
in
the
bunches
of
herbs
that
swung
from
the
rafters
and
in
the
pots
and
pans
on
the
dresser
some
of
them
were
playing
seesaw
on
the
beams
of
the
ceiling
tossing
their
heels
and
waving
their
feathered
caps
as
they
teetered
up
and
down
on
bits
of
straw
or
green
twigs
numbers
of
them
were
swinging
in
the
cobwebs
that
festooned
the
rafters
or
riding
mice
in
and
out
through
holes
in
the
thatch
i
noted
that
all
the
little
men
were
dressed
in
green
tricked
out
with
red
and
had
feathered
caps
and
high
with
silver
spurs
their
ladies
if
you
please
were
all
decked
in
grand
fashion
their
gowns
were
of
green
velvet
with
long
trains
and
looped
up
with
silver
chains
and
bells
they
wore
with
wreaths
of
the
most
beautiful
flowers
around
them
while
sprigs
of
blossoms
and
garlands
decorated
all
parts
of
their
dress
and
were
in
their
hands
as
well
they
were
the
sauciest
little
people
i
ever
did
see
they
pranced
around
on
their
boots
sparkling
with
diamond
buckles
when
i
peeped
into
the
under
betty
s
bunk
i
spied
some
of
the
ugly
spriggans
sitting
there
looking
very
gloomy
because
they
have
to
watch
the
treasures
that
are
hidden
in
the
ground
and
do
other
disagreeable
things
that
the
merry
spriggans
never
have
to
do
while
looking
into
the
dark
corner
i
heard
strains
of
sweet
unearthly
music
outside
the
house
glancing
around
the
room
i
saw
that
all
was
changed
the
walls
were
hung
with
tapestry
the
chimney
stools
on
which
we
sat
were
carved
chairs
betty
and
i
sat
under
a
canopy
of
embroidered
satin
and
our
feet
rested
on
a
silken
carpet
and
wherever
the
little
spriggans
trod
they
left
circles
like
diamonds
on
the
floor
the
sweet
music
was
now
close
at
hand
under
the
little
window
and
a
moment
after
a
troop
of
the
little
people
appeared
on
the
playing
on
pipes
flutes
and
other
instruments
made
of
green
reeds
from
the
brook
and
of
shells
from
the
shore
the
fairy
band
stepped
down
most
gracefully
from
the
and
was
closely
followed
by
a
long
train
of
little
men
and
women
magnificently
dressed
and
carrying
bunches
of
flowers
in
their
hands
all
walked
in
an
orderly
procession
two
by
two
and
bowed
or
curtsied
to
betty
and
cast
the
flowers
in
her
lap
i
saw
their
many
bunches
of
clover
and
sprigs
of
magic
herbs
with
these
she
makes
her
salves
and
lotions
then
all
the
spriggans
who
had
been
dancing
and
capering
about
the
ceiling
and
floor
joined
the
others
and
came
crowding
around
betty
she
did
not
look
surprised
and
i
did
not
say
anything
to
let
her
know
that
i
saw
the
spriggans
then
began
to
pour
dew
over
her
dress
out
of
and
from
the
bottles
of
the
foxglove
immediately
her
jacket
was
changed
into
the
finest
and
richest
cloth
of
a
soft
cream
colour
and
her
dress
became
velvet
the
colour
of
all
the
flowers
and
it
was
draped
over
a
petticoat
of
silk
quilted
with
silver
cord
the
little
people
brought
tiny
nosegays
of
pimpernel
and
dainty
blue
pink
and
white
and
hundreds
of
other
fairy
blossoms
like
stars
and
butterflies
these
delicate
little
sprigs
they
stitched
all
over
betty
s
petticoat
together
with
branching
moss
and
the
tips
of
the
wild
grass
all
around
the
bottom
of
her
skirt
they
made
a
wreath
of
tiny
bramble
leaves
with
roses
and
berries
red
and
black
many
of
the
little
people
perched
themselves
on
the
top
of
the
chair
in
which
betty
sat
and
even
stood
on
her
shoulders
so
that
they
might
arrange
her
every
curl
and
every
hair
some
took
the
lids
off
pretty
little
urns
they
carried
in
their
hands
and
poured
perfume
on
her
head
which
spread
the
sweetest
odours
through
the
room
i
very
much
admired
the
lovely
little
urns
with
their
grooved
lids
but
when
i
picked
one
up
it
was
only
a
of
the
wild
poppy
they
placed
no
other
ornament
in
her
hair
except
a
small
twig
of
holly
full
of
bright
red
berries
yet
betty
decked
out
by
her
fairy
friends
was
more
beautiful
than
the
loveliest
queen
of
may
my
senses
were
overcome
by
the
smell
of
the
fairy
odours
and
the
scent
of
the
flowers
and
the
sweet
perfume
of
honey
with
which
the
walls
of
the
house
seemed
bursting
and
my
head
fell
forward
and
i
slept
how
long
i
dozed
i
do
not
know
but
when
i
woke
i
saw
that
all
the
little
spriggans
were
glaring
at
me
angrily
they
thrust
out
their
tongues
and
made
the
most
horrid
grimaces
i
was
so
frightened
that
i
jumped
up
and
ran
out
of
the
house
and
shut
the
door
but
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
not
leave
the
place
without
taking
another
peep
i
put
my
left
eye
to
the
and
would
you
believe
it
the
house
was
just
as
it
was
when
i
entered
it
the
floor
was
bare
and
there
sat
betty
in
her
old
clothes
before
the
fire
then
i
winked
and
looked
with
the
right
eye
and
there
was
the
beautiful
room
and
betty
seated
in
her
fine
beneath
the
silken
canopy
while
all
the
little
spriggans
were
dancing
and
capering
around
her
i
tore
myself
away
glad
to
get
out
of
the
cove
and
hurried
to
penzance
to
do
my
shopping
although
it
was
so
late
and
as
i
was
standing
in
front
of
a
booth
what
should
i
see
but
a
little
spriggan
helping
himself
to
hanks
of
yarn
stockings
and
all
sorts
of
fine
things
ah
ha
my
little
man
cried
i
are
you
not
ashamed
to
be
carrying
on
this
way
stealing
all
those
goods
is
that
thee
old
joan
said
he
which
eye
canst
thou
see
me
with
after
winking
both
my
eyes
i
said
tis
plain
enough
that
i
can
see
you
with
my
right
then
in
a
twinkling
he
pointed
his
finger
at
my
right
eye
and
mumbled
a
spell
and
i
just
caught
the
words
the
pry
shall
nor
peep
nor
spy
but
shall
lose
her
charmèd
eye
then
he
blew
in
my
face
and
was
gone
and
when
i
looked
around
my
right
eye
was
blind
and
from
that
day
to
this
i
have
never
seen
a
blink
with
my
anointed
eye

the

asleep
but
she
was
dead

sorrow

the
once

to

she
said

and
after
she
had
walked
a
long
way
she
came
to

met
her
and
asked

the

then
a
little
dog
came
creeping
up
to
her
wagging
his

she
smiled
and
said

which
you
will

then
the

placed
a
beautiful

and
gave
her
a
big
sackful
of
gold
and
told
her
she
might
go
back
to
her
mother
the
girl
thanked
the
lady
and
leaving
the
house
hastened
home
when
her
mother
and
sisters
saw
how
pretty
she
was
with
the
star
on
her
forehead
and
when
they
felt
the
big
sack
of
gold
on
her
shoulder
they
were
astonished
then
the
eldest
sister
began
to
cry
and
say

a
servant
too

the
girl
wept
and
would
not
leave
her

in
peace
until
she
said

she
set
off
and
walked
until
she
came
to
the

began
to
eat
up
all
the
good
things
in
the
pantry
just
then
the
little
dog
came

and
she
gave

a
kick
but
the
little
dog
would
not
leave
her
and
followed
her
about
until
she
drove

on
the
end
of
her
nose
and
gave
her
a
big
bag
of
charcoal
and
sent
her
back
to
her
home
and
when
her
mother
saw
her
she
was
so
ashamed
that
she
locked
her
in
the
cellar
as
for
the
youngest
girl
she
shared
her
sack
of
gold
with
her
mother
and
other
sister
and
then
she
married
a
fine
young
man
and
lived
happily
ever
after
the
pixies
there
was
once
a
little
cottage
in
the
middle
of
a
flower
garden
its
walls
were
covered
with
roses
and
its
porch
was
twined
with
clematis
the
bees
buzzed
over
the
flowers
and
the
butterflies
fluttered
about
the
porch
and
a
hundred
little
green
pixies
lived
in
the
wood
near
by
in
this
cottage
two
orphan
sisters
dwelt
all
alone
one
morning
the
elder
sister
mary
got
up
at
break
of
day
she
milked
the
cow
churned
the
butter
swept
the
hearth
and
made
the
breakfast
then
she
sat
on
the
porch
to
spin
and
sang
merrily
the
wheel
goes
round
with
a
whirring
humming
sound
but
the
younger
sister
alice
lay
in
bed
asleep
then
mary
put
her
spinning
aside
and
called
wake
alice
wake
there
is
much
for
you
to
do
while
i
go
to
the
i
must
sell
our
yarn
and
buy

new
dress
while
i
am
gone
don
t
forget
to
bring
in
the
firewood

the
honeycomb
and
fill
the
pixies
but
alice
did
not
answer
so
mary
put
on
her
hood
and
took
her
basket
full
of
yarn
she
walked
all
the
way
to
the
and
sold
her
yarn
and
bought
the
new
dress
then
she
walked
home
again
the
sun
was
set
when
she
reached
the
cottage
and
alice
was
sitting
idle
on
the
porch
the
honeycomb
was
not
drained
the
firewood
was
not
brought
in
the
bed
was
not
made
and
the
supper
was
uncooked
and
although
mary
was
tired
and
hungry
she
had
to
cook
the
supper
and
make
the
bed
then
the
sisters
went
to
sleep
by
and
by
the
hundred
little
green
pixies
came
creeping
creeping
into
the
kitchen
they
pattered
softly
about
and
whispered
so
that
the
sisters
should
not
hear
them
some
ran
to
the
and
began
to
spin
others
built
a
fire
under
the
oven
and
mixed
and
kneaded
the
bread
one
took
a
broom
and
swept
the
floor
and
another
brought
in
the
firewood
when
all
the
yarn
was
spun
the
bread
baked
and
the
kitchen
tidy
the
pixies
ran
to
the
to
get
a
drink
but
there
was
not
a
drop
of
water
in
it
and
oh
how
angry
they
were
then
mary
awoke
and
cried
alice
alice
don
t
you
hear
those
angry
buzzings
surely
you
did
not
forget
to
fill
the
pixies
but
alice
answered
i
did
not
draw
the
water
and
i
will
not
leave
my
bed
now
to
fetch
it
for
any
little
pixy
then
she
went
to
sleep
again
but
mary
got
up
and
though
her
feet
were
tired
and
sore
she
took
the
pail
and
ran
through
the
garden
to
the
spring
and
as
she
stooped
she
saw
a
hundred
little
faces
laughing
at
her
from
the
water
she
dipped
her
pail
and
they
were
gone
she
lifted
the
full
pail
and
felt
little
hands
seize
it
and
bear
it
along
it
was
carried
to
the
door
and
into
the
kitchen
and
set
down
by
the
hearth
but
she
could
see
no
one
so
she
went
to
bed
again
the
next
morning
early
mary
got
up
she
ran
to
the
pail
and
looked
into
it
then
she
clapped
her
hands
and
called
come
alice
come
see
the
silver
pennies
shining
at
the
bottom
of
the
clear
water
there
must
be
a
hundred
of
them
come
sister
dear
then
alice
waking
tried
to
sit
up
but
she
screamed
with
fright
for
she
could
not
move
her
hands
and
feet
indeed
she
could
not
rise
at
all
and
that
day
and
the
next
and
for
many
days
after
she
lay
helpless
on
her
bed
and
mary
fed
and
comforted
her
and
every
night
the
hundred
little
green
pixies
came
creeping
creeping
into
the
kitchen
they
swept
they
baked
they
sewed
they
spun
and
they
drank
from
mary
s
and
every
night
they
left
one
piece
of
silver
there
and
so
a
whole
year
passed
and
alice
lay
and
thought
and
thought
and
thought
about
her
idle
ways
and
one
night
she
called
mary
to
her
and
wept
and
said
oh
sister
if
only
i
could
get
up
and
feel
the
warm
sunshine
and
play
among
the
flowers
and
if
only
i
were
strong
enough
to
work
for
you
as
you
have
worked
for
me
and
mary
kissed
and
comforted
her
the
next
morning
came
and
mary
got
up
at
break
of
day
she
ran
and
looked
into
the
then
she
clapped
her
hands
and
called
come
alice

the
silver
pennies
shining
at
the
bottom
of
the
clear
water
there
must
be
a
hundred
of
them
come
sister
dear
and
alice
forgot
that
she
could
not
move
she
sprang
lightly
out
of
bed
and
ran
into
the
kitchen
and
she
was
all
well
and
happy
again
and
oh
how
glad
the
sisters
were
how
they
kissed
each
other
and
laughed
with
joy
they
milked
the
cow
and
churned
and
baked
and
cooked
and
sat
spinning
on
the
porch
and
the
bees
buzzed
and
the
butterflies
fluttered
and
the
sisters
sang
merrily
the
wheels
go
round
with
a
whirring
humming
sound

brownie
of
blednoch

at

sight
of

matted
head

on
his
breast
a
long
blue
beard
fell
to
his
waist
around
his
hairy
form
was
wrapped
a
cloth
of
woven
rushes
green
his
long
thin
arms
trailed
on
the
ground
his
hands
were
claws
his
feet

time

speaks

said
the
old
housewife
our
workers
are
scarce
we
have
much
to
do
let
us
try
this
then
should
you
have
seen
the
brownie
work
by
night
he
swept
the
kitchen
clean
he
scoured
the
pots
until
they
shone
by
the
light
of
the
moon
he
threshed
the
grain
he
gathered
the
crops
into
the
barn
he
watched
the
sheep
and
tended
the
kine
by
day
he
played
with
the
bonny
bairns
and
sang
them
strange
songs
of
the
land
without
sky
so
passed
the
months
away
and
all
throve
for
the
goodman
and
the
old
housewife
but
when
the
cold
night
winds
blew
hard
a
lass
who
saw
the
brownie
s
clothes
woven
all
of
rushes
green
made
him
a
suit
of
sheep
s
wool
warm
she
placed
it
by
his
porridge
bowl
and
that
night
was
heard
a
wailing
cry
so
weary
and
so
dreary
long
may
i
now
weep
and
groan
wages
of
clothes
are
now
my
own
o
luckless
and
down
the
street
and
through
the
town
his
voice
came
back
upon
the
wind
to
blednoch
farewell
farewell
and
never
again
in
all
that
land
was
seen
the
brownie
elsa
and
the
ten
elves
once
upon
a
time
a
little
girl
named
elsa
lived
on
a
farm
she
was
pretty
and
generous
but
she
did
not
like
to
work
her
father
was
very
proud
of
her
and
sent
her
to
school
in
the
city
she
learned
to
read
write
sing
and
dance
but
still
she
did
not
know
how
to
cook
sew
or
care
for
a
house
when
she
grew
older
she
was
so
good
and
beautiful
that
many
young
men
wished
her
for
a
wife
but
she
said
no
to
all
except
to
her
neighbour
gunner
a
handsome
industrious
young
farmer
soon
they
were
married
and
went
to
live
on
his
farm
at
first
all
was
happiness
but
as
the
days
passed
and
elsa
did
not
direct
the
servants
or
look
after
the
house
everything
went
wrong
the
storerooms
were
in
disorder
the
food
was
stolen
and
the
house
dirty
poor
gunner
was
at
his
wits
end
he
loved
elsa
too
much
to
scold
her
the
day
before
christmas
came
the
sun
had
been
up
for
a
long
time
and
still
elsa
lay
in
bed
a
servant
ran
into
her
room
saying
dear
mistress
shall
we
get
ready
the
men
s
luncheon
so
that
they
may
go
to
the
woods
leave
the
room
said
elsa
sleepily
and
do
not
waken
me
again
another
servant
came
running
in
dear
mistress
she
cried
the
leaven
is
working
and
if
you
come
quickly
the
bread
will
be
better
than
i
want
candlewicks
dear
mistress
called
a
third
and
what
meat
shall
we
roast
for
s
feast
shouted
a
fourth
and
so
it
was
servant
after
servant
came
running
into
the
room
asking
for
orders
but
elsa
would
neither
answer
nor
get
up
last
of
all
came
gunner
impatient
because
his
men
had
not
yet
started
for
the
woods
dear
elsa
he
said
gently
my
mother
used
to
prepare
things
the
night
before
so
that
the
servants
might
begin
work
early
we
are
now
going
to
the
woods
and
shall
not
be
back
until
night
remember
there
are
a
few
yards
of
cloth
on
the
loom
waiting
to
be
then
gunner
went
away
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
elsa
got
up
in
a
rage
and
dressing
herself
ran
through
the
kitchen
to
the
little
house
where
the
loom
was
kept
she
slammed
the
door
behind
her
and
threw
herself
down
on
a
couch
no
she
screamed
i
won
t
i
won
t
endure
this
drudgery
any
more
who
would
have
thought
that
gunner
would
make
a
servant
of
me
and
wear
my
life
out
with
work
oh
me
oh
me
is
there
no
one
from
far
or
near
to
help
me
i
can
said
a
deep
voice
and
elsa
raising
her
head
with
fright
saw
standing
close
to
her
an
old
man
wrapped
in
a
gray
cloak
and
wearing
a
hat
i
am
old
man
hoberg
he
said
and
have
served
your
family
for
many
generations
you
my
child
are
unhappy
because
you
are
idle
to
love
work
is
a
joy
i
will
now
give
you
ten
obedient
servants
who
shall
do
all
your
tasks
for
he
shook
his
cloak
and
out
of
its
folds
tumbled
ten
funny
little
men
they
capered
and
pranced
about
making
faces
then
they
swiftly
put
the
room
in
order
and
finished
weaving
the
cloth
on
the
loom
after
all
was
done
they
ran
and
stood
in
an
obedient
row
before
elsa
dear
child
reach
hither
your
hands
said
the
old
man
and
elsa
trembling
gave
him
the
tips
of
her
fingers
then
he
said
away
all
of
you
to
your
places
and
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
the
little
men
vanished
into
elsa
s
fingers
and
the
old
man
disappeared
elsa
could
hardly
believe
what
had
happened
and
sat
staring
at
her
hands
suddenly
a
wonderful
desire
to
work
came
over
her
she
could
sit
still
no
longer
why
am
i
idling
here
cried
she
cheerfully
it
is
late
in
the
morning
and
the
house
is
not
in
order
the
servants
are
and
up
she
jumped
and
hastened
into
the
kitchen
and
was
soon
giving
orders
and
singing
while
she
prepared
the
dinner
and
when
gunner
came
home
that
night
all
was
clean
and
bright
to
welcome
him
and
the
smell
of
good
things
to
eat
filled
the
house
and
after
that
day
elsa
rose
early
each
morning
and
went
about
her
work
and
happy
no
one
was
more
pleased
and
proud
than
she
to
see
how
the
work
of
the
farmhouse
prospered
under
her
hands
and
health
wealth
and
happiness
came
and
stayed
with
elsa
and
gunner
piskey
fine
and
piskey
gay
tis
told
in
the
west
country
how
the
piskey
threshed
the
corn
and
did
other
odd
jobs
for
farmer
boslow
as
long
as
the
old
man
lived
and
after
his
death
the
piskey
worked
for
his
widow
and
this
is
how
she
lost
the
little
fellow
one
night
when
the
hills
were
covered
with
snow
and
the
wind
was
blowing
hard
the
widow
boslow
left
in
the
barn
for
the
piskey
a
larger
bowl
than
usual
full
of
milk
thickened
with
oatmeal
it
was
clear
moonlight
and
she
stopped
outside
the
door
and
peeped
in
to
see
if
the
piskey
would
come
to
eat
his
supper
while
it
was
hot
the
moonlight
shone
through
a
little
window
on
to
the
barn
floor
and
there
sitting
on
a
sheaf
of
oats
she
saw
the
piskey
greedily
eating
his
thickened
milk
he
soon
emptied
the
bowl
and
scraped
it
as
clean
with
the
wooden
spoon
as
if
it
had
been
washed
then
he
placed
them
both
in
a
corner
and
stood
up
and
patted
and
stroked
his
stomach
and
smacked
his
lips
as
if
to
say
that
s
good
of
the
old
dear
see
if
i
don
t
thresh
well
for
her
but
when
the
piskey
turned
around
the
widow
saw
that
he
had
nothing
on
but
rags
and
very
few
of
them
how
the
poor
piskey
must
suffer
thought
she
he
has
to
pass
most
of
his
time
out
among
the
rushes
in
the
boggy
moor
and
his
legs
are
naked
and
his
breeches
are
full
of
holes
i
ll
make
the
poor
fellow
a
good
warm
suit
of
at
once
no
sooner
thought
than
she
went
home
and
began
the
suit
in
a
day
or
two
she
had
made
a
coat
and
breeches
and
knitted
a
long
pair
of
sheep
s
wool
stockings
with
garters
and
a
nightcap
all
nicely
knitted
too
when
night
came
the
widow
placed
the
piskey
s
new
clothes
and
a
big
bowl
of
thickened
milk
on
the
barn
floor
just
where
the
moonlight
fell
brightest
then
she
went
outside
and
peeped
through
the
door
soon
she
saw
the
piskey
eating
his
supper
and
squinting
at
the
new
clothes
laying
down
his
empty
bowl
he
took
the
things
and
put
them
on
over
his
rags
then
he
began
capering
and
jumping
around
the
barn
singing
fine
and
piskey
gay
piskey
now
will
run
away
and
sure
enough
he
bolted
out
of
the
door
and
passed
the
widow
without
so
much
as
i
wish
you
well
till
i
see
you
again
and
he
never
came
back
to
the
farm
the
fairy
wedding
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
lovely
young
girl
daughter
of
rich
parents
who
was
known
for
her
gentleness
and
goodness
one
night
while
she
was
lying
awake
in
her
bed
watching
the
moonbeams
dance
on
the
floor
her
door
was
softly
opened
then
in
tripped
a
little
fairy
man
clad
in
a
gray
jacket
and
red
cap
he
came
lightly
toward
her
bed
nodding
in
a
most
friendly
way
do
not
be
afraid
dear
lady
he
said
i
have
come
to
ask
a
favour
of
and
i
will
do
it
willingly
if
i
can
answered
the
girl
who
had
begun
to
recover
from
her
fright
oh
it
will
not
be
difficult
said
the
fairy
man
for
many
years
i
and
mine
have
lived
under
the
floor
of
your
kitchen
just
where
the
stands
but
the
cask
has
become
old
and
leaky
so
that
we
are
continually
annoyed
by
the
dripping
of
water
our
home
is
never
that
shall
be
seen
to
in
the
morning
said
the
girl
thank
you
dear
lady
said
the
fairy
man
and
making
an
elegant
bow
he
disappeared
as
softly
as
he
had
come
the
next
day
at
the
girl
s
request
her
parents
had
the
removed
and
after
that
to
the
surprise
of
the
servants
the
was
done
at
night
when
all
slept
and
never
a
pitcher
or
glass
was
broken
in
the
house
from
that
day
forth
so
the
fairies
showed
their
gratitude
well
a
few
months
after
this
the
pretty
young
girl
was
again
lying
awake
in
her
bed
watching
the
moonbeams
dance
on
the
floor
when
again
her
door
was
opened
softly
and
the
fairy
man
stole
in
dear
lady
said
he
smiling
and
bowing
now
i
have
another
request
to
make
which
in
your
kindness
you
will
surely
not
refuse
to
what
is
it
asked
she
will
you
honour
me
and
my
house
he
replied
and
stand
at
the
christening
of
my
newly
born
daughter
the
girl
arose
and
dressing
herself
followed
the
fairy
man
through
many
passages
and
rooms
that
she
had
never
known
existed
at
last
they
entered
a
small
but
elegant
apartment
in
which
a
host
of
fairies
were
assembled
they
immediately
christened
the
fairy
baby
and
as
the
little
man
was
about
to
conduct
the
girl
again
to
her
room
the
fairies
filled
her
pockets
with
what
looked
like
shavings
the
little
man
then
led
her
back
through
the
same
winding
passages
and
as
soon
as
she
was
safely
in
her
room
he
said
if
we
should
meet
at
another
time
you
must
never
laugh
at
me
and
mine
we
love
you
for
your
goodness
and
modesty
but
if
you
laugh
at
us
you
and
i
shall
never
see
each
other
when
he
was
gone
the
girl
threw
all
the
shavings
into
the
fireplace
and
lay
down
and
went
to
sleep
and
lo
the
next
morning
when
the
maid
came
in
to
build
the
fire
she
found
in
the
ashes
the
most
beautiful
jewelry
all
of
pure
gold
set
with
gems
and
of
the
finest
workmanship
now
it
happened
some
time
after
this
that
the
girl
s
wedding
day
arrived
there
was
great
bustling
and
preparations
for
a
splendid
feast
at
length
the
wedding
hour
came
the
bride
beautifully
dressed
and
wearing
her
fairy
jewels
and
a
crown
on
her
golden
hair
was
conducted
to
the
hall
where
the
guests
were
waiting
during
the
ceremony
she
chanced
to
glance
around
the
hall
she
saw
near
the
fireplace
all
her
friends
the
fairies
gathered
for
a
wedding
feast
the
bridegroom
was
a
little
elf
and
the
bride
was
her
goddaughter
and
the
feast
was
spread
on
a
golden
table
no
one
but
the
girl
could
see
the
fairies
just
at
that
moment
one
of
the
elves
who
was
acting
as
waiter
at
the
fairy
bridal
stumbled
over
a
twig
that
lay
on
the
floor
and
fell
forgetting
the
caution
that
the
little
man
had
given
her
the
girl
burst
into
a
hearty
laugh
instantly
the
golden
table
the
elfin
bridegroom
and
bride
and
all
the
fairy
guests
vanished
and
from
that
day
to
this
no
work
was
ever
done
at
night
in
that
kitchen
nor
were
any
fairies
ever
seen
about
that
house
the
tomts
every
child
knows
or
ought
to
know
if
he
does
not
know
that
the
tomt
is
a
queer
little
elfin
man
old
and
wizen
and
clad
in
gray
clothes
and
red
cap
he
lives
in
the
pantry
or
in
the
barn
at
night
he
washes
the
dishes
and
sweeps
the
kitchen
floor
or
threshes
the
farmer
s
corn
and
looks
after
his
sheep
oh
the
tomt
is
a
very
friendly
elf
but
his
feelings
are
easily
hurt
and
if
any
one
is
impolite
to
him
he
runs
away
and
is
never
seen
again
now
it
happened
once
upon
a
time
that
there
was
a
farmer
whose
crops
and
flocks
and
herds
prospered
so
well
that
all
knew
he
was
aided
by
a
tomt
in
fact
he
became
the
richest
farmer
in
his
neighbourhood
although
he
had
few
servants
his
house
was
always
in
order
and
his
grain
nicely
threshed
but
he
never
saw
the
elf
who
did
all
these
things
for
him
one
night
he
decided
to
watch
and
see
who
worked
in
his
barn
he
hid
behind
a
door
by
and
by
he
saw
not
tomt
but
a
of
tomts
come
into
the
barn
each
carried
a
stalk
of
rye
but
the
littlest
tomt
of
all
not
bigger
than
a
thumb
puffed
and
breathed
very
hard
although
he
carried
but
a
straw
on
his
shoulder
why
do
you
puff
so
hard
cried
the
farmer
from
his
your
burden
is
not
so
great
his
burden
is
according
to
his
strength
for
he
is
but
one
night
old
answered
one
of
the
tomts
hereafter
you
shall
have
less
and
with
that
all
the
little
men
vanished
and
the
grain
lay
unthreshed
on
the
barn
floor
and
from
that
day
all
luck
disappeared
from
the
farmer
s
house
and
he
was
soon
reduced
to
beggary

kintaro
the
golden
boy
once
upon
a
time
a
poor
widow
and
her
little
boy
lived
in
a
cave
in
the
midst
of
a
great
forest
the
little
one
s
name
was
kintaro
the
golden
boy
he
was
a
sturdy
fellow
with
red
cheeks
and
laughing
eyes
he
was
different
from
other
boys
when
he
fell
down
he
sang
cheerily
if
he
wandered
away
from
the
cave
he
could
always
find
his
way
home
again
and
while
he
was
yet
very
small
he
could
swing
a
heavy
axe
in
circles
round
his
head
kintaro
grew
to
be
ten
years
old
and
a
handsome
manly
lad
he
was
then
his
mother
looked
at
him
often
and
sighed
deeply
must
my
child
grow
up
in
this
lonely
forest
thought
she
sadly
will
he
never
take
his
place
in
the
world
of
men
alas
alas
but
kintaro
was
perfectly
happy
the
forest
was
full
of
his
playmates
every
living
thing
loved
him
when
he
lay
on
his
bed
of
ferns
the
birds
flew
nestling
to
his
shoulder
and
peeped
into
his
eyes
the
butterflies
and
moths
settled
on
his
face
and
trod
softly
over
his
brown
body
but
his
truest
friends
were
the
bears
that
dwelt
in
the
forest
when
he
was
tired
of
walking
a
carried
him
on
her
back
her
cubs
ran
to
greet
him
and
romped
and
wrestled
with
him
sometimes
kintaro
would
climb
up
the
and
sit
on
the
topmost
bough
and
laugh
at
the
vain
efforts
of
his
shaggy
to
follow
him
then
came
the
bears
and
the
feast
of
golden
liquid
honey
now
it
happened
one
summer
that
there
was
to
be
a
great
day
of
sports
for
the
forest
creatures
soon
after
dawn
a
stag
came
to
waken
kintaro
the
boy
with
a
farewell
kiss
to
his
mother
and
a
caress
to
the
stag
leaped
on
his
friend
s
back
and
wound
his
arms
around
his
soft
neck
and
away
they
went
with
long
noiseless
bounds
through
the
forest
up
hill
across
valleys
through
thickets
they
bounded
until
they
reached
a
leafy
spot
in
a
wide
green
glade
near
a
foaming
cataract
there
the
stag
set
kintaro
down
and
the
boy
seated
himself
on
a
mossy
stone
and
began
to
whistle
sweetly
immediately
the
forest
rustled
with
living
things
the
came
swiftly
to
his
call
the
eagle
and
the
hawk
flew
from
distant
heights
the
crane
and
the
heron
stepped
proudly
from
their
and
hastened
to
the
glade
all
kintaro
s
feathered
friends
flocked
thither
and
rested
in
the
cedar
branches
then
through
the
undergrowth
came
running
the
wolf
the
bear
the
badger
the
fox
and
the
martin
and
seated
themselves
around
kintaro
they
all
began
to
speak
to
him
he
listened
as
they
told
their
joys
and
sorrows
and
he
spoke
graciously
to
each
for
kintaro
had
learned
the
languages
of
beasts
birds
and
flowers
and
who
had
taught
kintaro
all
this
the
tengus
the
and
even
while
he
was
listening
to
the
forest
creatures
the
tengus
themselves
came
tumbling
out
of
the
trees
or
popping
up
from
behind
stones
very
strange
little
elves
they
were
each
had
the
body
of
a
man
the
head
of
a
hawk
powerful
claws
and
a
long
long
nose
that
usually
trailed
on
the
ground
and
every
little
tengu
wore
on
his
feet
tiny
clogs
all
these
queer
came
toward
kintaro
walking
very
proudly
with
their
arms
crossed
heads
well
thrown
back
and
long
noses
held
erect
in
the
air
at
their
head
was
the
chief
tengu
very
old
with
a
gray
beard
and
a
sharp
beak
the
chief
tengu
seated
himself
beside
kintaro
on
the
mossy
stone
and
waved
a
fan
in
the
air
immediately
the
sports
began
the
young
tengus
were
fond
of
games
they
found
their
long
noses
most
useful
they
now
fenced
with
them
and
balanced
bowls
full
of
goldfish
on
them
then
two
of
the
tengus
straightened
their
noses
and
joined
them
together
and
so
made
a
tight
rope
on
this
a
young
tengu
with
a
paper
umbrella
in
one
hand
and
leading
a
little
dog
with
the
other
danced
and
jumped
through
a
hoop
and
all
the
time
an
old
tengu
sang
a
and
another
tengu
beat
time
with
a
fan
kintaro
cheered
loudly
and
clapped
his
hands
and
the
beasts
and
birds
barked
hissed
growled
or
sang
for
pleasure
so
the
morning
passed
swiftly
and
delightfully
and
the
time
came
for
the
forest
animals
to
take
part
in
the
sports
they
did
so
running
leaping
tumbling
and
flying
last
of
all
stood
up
a
great
to
wrestle
with
kintaro
now
the
boy
had
been
taught
to
fight
by
his
friends
the
tengus
and
he
had
learned
from
them
many
skilful
tricks
so
he
and
the
bear
gripped
each
other
and
began
to
wrestle
very
hard
the
bear
was
powerful
and
strong
and
his
claws
like
iron
but
kintaro
was
not
afraid
backward
and
forward
they
swayed
and
struggled
while
the
tengus
and
the
forest
creatures
sat
watching
now
it
happened
that
the
great
hero
raiko
was
just
returning
from
slaying
many
horrible
ogres
and
hags
his
way
lay
through
the
forest
and
at
that
moment
he
heard
the
noise
of
the
wrestling
he
stopped
his
horse
and
peered
through
the
trees
into
the
glade
there
he
saw
the
circle
of
animals
and
little
tengus
and
kintaro
struggling
with
the
powerful
bear
just
at
that
moment
the
boy
with
a
skilful
movement
threw
the
clumsy
creature
to
the
ground
i
must
have
that
boy
for
my
son
thought
raiko
he
will
make
a
great
hero
he
must
be
mine
so
he
waited
until
kintaro
had
mounted
the
stag
and
bounded
away
through
the
forest
then
raiko
followed
him
on
his
swift
steed
to
the
cave
when
kintaro
s
mother
learned
that
raiko
was
the
mighty
warrior
who
had
slain
the
ogres
and
hags
she
let
him
take
her
son
to
his
castle
but
before
kintaro
went
he
called
together
all
his
friends
the
tengus
the
birds
and
the
beasts
and
bade
them
farewell
in
words
that
they
remember
to
this
day
his
mother
did
not
follow
her
son
to
the
land
of
men
for
she
loved
the
forest
best
but
kintaro
when
he
became
a
great
hero
often
came
to
see
her
in
her
home
and
all
the
people
of
japan
called
him
kintaro
the
golden
the
flower
fairies
once
upon
a
time
high
on
a
there
was
a
place
where
many
beautiful
flowers
grew
mostly
peonies
and
camellias
a
young
man
named
hwang
who
wished
to
study
all
alone
built
himself
a
little
house
near
by
one
day
he
noticed
from
his
window
a
lovely
young
girl
dressed
in
white
wandering
about
among
the
flowers
he
hastened
out
of
the
house
to
see
who
she
was
but
she
ran
behind
a
tall
white
peony
and
vanished
hwang
was
very
much
astonished
and
sat
down
to
watch
soon
the
girl
slipped
from
behind
the
white
peony
bringing
another
girl
with
her
who
was
dressed
in
red
they
wandered
about
hand
in
hand
until
they
came
near
hwang
when
the
girl
in
red
gave
a
scream
and
together
the
two
ran
back
among
the
flowers
their
robes
and
long
sleeves
fluttering
in
the
wind
and
scenting
all
the
air
hwang
dashed
after
them
but
they
had
vanished
completely
that
evening
as
hwang
was
sitting
over
his
books
he
was
astonished
to
see
the
white
girl
walk
into
his
little
room
with
tears
in
her
eyes
she
seemed
to
be
pleading
with
him
to
help
her
hwang
tried
to
comfort
her
but
she
did
not
speak
then
sobbing
bitterly
she
suddenly
vanished
this
appeared
to
hwang
as
very
strange
however
the
next
day
a
visitor
came
to
the
mountain
who
after
wandering
among
the
flowers
dug
up
the
tall
white
peony
and
carried
it
off
hwang
then
knew
that
the
white
girl
was
a
flower
fairy
and
he
became
very
sad
because
he
had
permitted
the
peony
to
be
carried
away
later
he
heard
that
the
flower
had
lived
only
a
few
days
at
this
he
wept
and
going
to
the
place
where
the
peony
had
stood
watered
the
spot
with
his
tears
while
he
was
weeping
the
girl
in
red
suddenly
stood
before
him
wringing
her
hands
and
wiping
her
eyes
alas
cried
she
that
my
dear
sister
should
have
been
torn
from
my
side
but
the
tears
hwang
that
you
have
shed
may
be
the
means
of
restoring
her
to
us
having
said
this
the
red
girl
disappeared
but
that
very
night
hwang
dreamed
that
she
came
to
him
and
seemed
to
implore
him
to
help
her
just
as
the
white
girl
had
done
in
the
morning
he
found
that
a
new
house
was
to
be
erected
close
by
and
that
the
builder
had
given
orders
to
cut
down
a
beautiful
tall
red
camellia
hwang
prevented
the
destruction
of
the
flower
and
that
same
evening
as
he
sat
watching
the
camellia
from
behind
its
tall
stem
came
the
white
girl
herself
hand
in
hand
with
her
red
sister
hwang
said
the
red
girl
the
king
of
the
flower
fairies
touched
by
your
tears
has
restored
my
white
sister
to
us
but
as
she
is
now
only
the
ghost
of
a
flower
she
must
dwell
forever
in
a
white
peony
and
you
will
never
see
her
at
these
words
hwang
caught
hold
of
the
white
girl
s
hand
but
it
melted
away
in
his
and
both
the
sisters
vanished
forever
from
his
sight
in
despair
he
looked
wildly
around
him
and
all
that
he
saw
was
a
tall
white
peony
and
a
beautiful
red
camellia
after
that
hwang
pined
and
fell
ill
and
died
he
was
buried
at
his
own
request
by
the
side
of
the
white
peony
and
before
very
long
another
white
peony
grew
up
very
straight
and
tall
on
hwang
s
grave
so
that
the
two
flowers
stood
lovingly
side
by
side
the
fairy
island
in
ancient
days
in
the
land
of
wales
there
was
a
blue
lake
on
a
high
mountain
no
one
had
ever
seen
a
bird
fly
near
it
and
over
its
waves
came
faint
strains
of
delicious
music
that
seemed
to
float
from
a
dimly
seen
island
in
its
centre
no
one
had
ever
ventured
to
sail
on
its
water
for
every
one
knew
that
it
was
the
abode
of
the
tylwyth
teg
the
water
fairies
it
happened
one
lovely
summer
day
that
a
hunter
was
wandering
along
the
margin
of
the
lake
and
found
himself
before
an
open
door
in
a
rock
he
entered
and
walked
along
a
dark
passage
that
led
downward
he
followed
this
for
some
time
and
suddenly
found
himself
passing
through
another
door
that
opened
on
the
mysterious
lovely
island
the
home
of
the
tylwyth
teg
all
around
him
was
a
most
enchanting
garden
where
grew
every
sort
of
delicious
fruit
and
fragrant
flower
the
next
moment
a
number
of
fairies
advanced
toward
him
and
graciously
welcomed
him
to
their
abode
they
bade
him
eat
as
much
fruit
as
he
wished
and
pick
the
flowers
but
told
him
not
to
take
anything
away
with
him
all
day
he
remained
on
the
island
listening
to
the
most
ravishing
music
and
feasting
and
dancing
with
the
fairies
when
it
came
time
for
him
to
leave
he
hid
a
flower
in
his
bosom
for
he
wished
to
show
it
to
his
friends
at
home
he
then
said
farewell
to
the
fairies
and
returned
through
the
dark
passage
to
the
margin
of
the
lake
but
when
he
put
his
hand
in
his
bosom
to
pull
out
the
flower
he
found
to
his
amazement
that
it
had
vanished
at
the
same
moment
he
fell
insensible
to
the
ground
when
he
came
to
himself
the
door
in
the
rock
had
disappeared
and
though
he
searched
day
after
day
he
never
again
found
the
passage
to
the
fairy
island
the
clover
some
years
ago
in
cornwall
there
was
a
farmer
who
owned
a
fine
red
cow
named
rosy
she
gave
twice
as
much
milk
as
any
ordinary
cow
even
in
winter
when
other
cows
were
reduced
to
skin
and
bone
rosy
kept
in
good
condition
and
yielded
richer
milk
than
ever
one
spring
rosy
continued
to
give
plenty
of
milk
every
morning
but
at
night
when
molly
the
maid
tried
to
milk
her
she
kicked
the
bucket
over
and
galloped
away
across
the
field
this
happened
night
after
night
and
such
behaviour
was
so
strange
that
dame
pendar
the
farmer
s
wife
decided
to
see
what
she
could
do
but
no
sooner
did
she
try
to
milk
rosy
than
the
cow
put
up
her
foot
kicked
the
bucket
to
bits
and
raced
away
bellowing
during
this
spring
the
farmer
s
cattle
and
fields
thrived
wonderfully
and
so
things
continued
until
may
day
now
on
may
day
night
when
molly
attempted
as
usual
to
milk
rosy
she
was
surprised
to
see
the
cow
stand
quietly
and
to
hear
her
begin
to
moo
gently
and
more
wonderful
still
the
pail
was
soon
full
of
foaming
new
milk
molly
rose
from
her
stool
and
pulling
a
handful
of
grass
rolled
it
into
a
pad
and
tucked
it
in
her
hat
so
that
she
might
the
more
easily
carry
the
bucket
on
her
head
she
put
the
hat
on
again
when
what
was
her
amazement
to
see
whole
swarms
of
little
fairies
running
around
rosy
while
others
were
on
her
back
neck
and
head
and
still
others
were
under
her
holding
up
clover
blossoms
and
buttercups
in
which
to
catch
the
streams
of
milk
that
flowed
from
her
udder
the
little
fairies
moved
around
so
swiftly
that
molly
s
head
grew
dizzy
as
she
watched
them
rosy
seemed
pleased
she
tried
to
lick
the
little
people
they
tickled
her
behind
the
horns
ran
up
and
down
her
back
smoothing
each
hair
or
chasing
away
the
flies
and
after
all
the
fairies
had
drunk
their
fill
they
brought
armfuls
of
clover
and
grass
to
rosy
and
she
ate
it
all
and
lowed
for
more
molly
stood
with
her
bucket
on
her
head
like
one
watching
the
little
people
and
she
would
have
continued
to
stand
there
but
dame
pendar
the
farmer
s
wife
called
her
loudly
to
know
why
she
had
not
brought
the
milk
if
there
was
any
at
the
first
sound
of
dame
pendar
s
voice
all
the
fairies
pointed
their
fingers
at
molly
and
made
such
wry
faces
that
she
was
frightened
almost
to
death
then
and
they
were
gone
molly
hurried
to
the
house
and
told
her
mistress
and
her
master
too
all
that
she
had
seen
surely
said
dame
pendar
you
must
have
a
clover
somewhere
about
you
give
me
the
wad
of
grass
in
your
molly
took
it
out
and
gave
it
to
her
and
sure
enough
there
was
the
clover
which
had
opened
molly
s
eyes
on
that
may
day
as
for
rosy
she
kicked
up
her
heels
and
bellowing
like
mad
galloped
away
over
meadows
and
moors
she
went
racing
and
roaring
and
was
never
seen
again
the
gillie
dhu
once
upon
a
time
a
little
girl
named
jessie
was
wandering
in
the
wood
and
lost
her
way
it
was
summer
time
and
the
air
was
warm
she
wandered
on
and
on
trying
to
find
her
way
home
but
she
could
not
find
the
path
out
of
the
wood
twilight
came
and
weary
and
footsore
she
sat
down
under
a
fir
tree
and
began
to
cry
why
are
you
crying
little
girl
said
a
voice
behind
her
jessie
looked
around
and
saw
a
pretty
little
man
dressed
in
moss
and
green
leaves
his
eyes
were
dark
as
dark
and
his
hair
was
black
as
black
and
his
mouth
was
large
and
showed
a
hundred
white
teeth
as
small
as
seed
pearls
he
was
smiling
merrily
and
his
cheeks
were
dimpled
and
his
eyes
soft
and
kindly
indeed
he
seemed
so
friendly
that
jessie
quite
forgot
to
be
afraid
why
are
you
crying
little
girl
he
asked
again
your
are
falling
like
dew
on
the
blue
flowers
at
your
feet
i
ve
lost
my
way
sobbed
jessie
and
the
night
is
coming
do
not
cry
little
girl
said
he
gently
i
will
lead
you
through
the
wood
i
know
every
path
the
rabbit
s
path
the
hare
s
path
the
fox
s
path
the
goat
s
path
the
path
of
the
deer
and
the
path
of
oh
thank
you
thank
you
exclaimed
jessie
as
she
looked
the
tiny
man
up
and
down
and
wondered
to
see
his
strange
clothes
where
do
you
dwell
little
girl
asked
he
so
jessie
told
him
and
he
said
you
have
been
walking
every
way
but
the
right
way
follow
me
and
you
ll
reach
home
before
the
stars
come
out
to
peep
at
us
through
the
then
he
turned
around
and
began
to
trip
lightly
in
front
of
her
and
she
followed
on
he
went
so
fast
that
she
feared
she
might
lose
sight
of
him
but
he
turned
around
again
and
again
and
smiled
and
beckoned
and
when
he
saw
that
she
was
still
far
behind
he
danced
and
twirled
about
until
she
came
up
then
he
scampered
on
as
before
at
length
jessie
reached
the
edge
of
the
wood
and
oh
joy
there
was
her
father
s
house
beside
the
blue
lake
then
the
little
man
smiling
bade
her
have
i
not
led
you
well
said
he
do
not
forget
me
i
am
the
gillie
dhu
from
fairyland
i
love
little
girls
and
boys
if
you
are
ever
lost
in
the
wood
again
i
will
come
and
help
you
little
girl
and
laughing
merrily
he
trotted
away
and
was
soon
lost
to
sight
among
the
trees
how
kahukura
learned
to
make
nets
new
once
upon
a
time
there
lived
a
man
named
kahukura
one
evening
when
he
was
on
his
way
to
a
distant
village
he
came
to
a
lonely
spot
on
the
seashore
as
he
was
walking
slowly
along
he
saw
a
large
pile
of
the
heads
and
tails
of
fishes
lying
on
the
beach
now
in
those
days
men
had
no
nets
and
were
obliged
to
catch
fish
with
spears
and
hooks
and
when
kahukura
saw
the
pile
he
was
very
much
astonished
who
has
had
such
luck
he
exclaimed
it
is
hard
to
catch
one
fish
here
must
be
the
heads
and
tails
of
a
thousand
then
he
looked
closely
at
the
footprints
in
the
sand
no
mortals
have
been
fishing
here
he
cried
fairies
must
have
done
this
i
will
watch
and
see
what
they
so
when
darkness
came
he
returned
to
the
spot
and
hid
behind
a
rock
he
waited
a
long
time
and
at
last
he
saw
a
fleet
of
tiny
canoes
come
spinning
over
the
waves
they
ranged
themselves
in
a
line
at
a
distance
from
the
shore
and
kahukura
could
see
many
little
figures
in
them
bending
and
pulling
he
could
even
hear
small
voices
shouting
the
net
here
the
net
there
then
the
little
figures
dropped
something
overboard
and
began
to
haul
it
toward
the
shore
singing
very
sweetly
the
while
when
the
canoes
drew
near
land
kahukura
saw
that
each
was
crowded
with
fairies
they
all
sprang
out
upon
the
beach
and
began
to
drag
ashore
a
great
net
filled
with
fishes
while
the
fairies
were
struggling
with
the
net
kahukura
joined
them
and
hauled
away
at
a
rope
he
was
a
very
fair
man
so
that
his
skin
seemed
almost
as
white
as
the
fairies
and
they
did
not
notice
him
so
he
pulled
away
and
pulled
away
and
soon
the
net
was
landed
the
fairies
ran
forward
to
divide
the
catch
it
was
just
at
the
peep
of
dawn
and
they
hurried
to
take
all
the
fish
they
could
carry
each
fairy
stringing
his
share
by
running
a
twig
through
the
gills
and
as
they
strung
the
fish
they
kept
calling
out
to
one
another
hurry
hurry
we
must
finish
before
the
sun
kahukura
had
a
short
string
with
a
knot
in
the
end
and
he
strung
his
share
on
it
until
it
was
filled
but
when
he
lifted
the
string
the
knot
gave
way
and
all
the
fish
slid
to
the
ground
then
some
of
the
fairies
ran
forward
to
help
him
and
tied
the
knot
again
he
filled
the
string
and
all
the
fish
slid
off
and
again
the
fairies
tied
the
knot
meanwhile
day
began
to
break
over
the
sea
and
the
sun
to
rise
then
the
fairies
saw
kahukura
s
face
and
knew
that
he
was
a
man
they
gave
little
cries
of
terror
they
ran
this
way
and
that
in
confusion
they
left
their
fish
and
canoes
they
abandoned
their
net
and
shrieking
they
all
vanished
over
the
sea
kahukura
seeing
that
he
was
alone
made
haste
to
examine
the
canoes
they
were
only
the
stems
of
flax
he
lifted
the
net
it
was
woven
of
rushes
curiously
tied
he
carried
it
home
and
made
some
like
it
for
his
neighbours
after
that
he
taught
his
children
how
to
weave
nets
and
so
say
the
maori
folk
they
all
learned
to
make
nets
and
from
that
day
to
this
they
have
caught
many
fish
echo
the
cave
fairy
the
island
of
in
the
very
long
ago
rangi
the
brave
came
from
the
to
the
island
of
mangaia
swiftly
over
the
blue
waves
sped
his
canoe
he
stepped
out
upon
the
land
and
lay
down
to
rest
in
the
shade
of
a
tree
covered
with
gorgeous
blooms
and
after
he
had
slept
and
was
refreshed
he
arose
and
wandered
about
the
island
beautiful
was
the
place
with
cocoa
palms
waving
their
tall
fronds
in
the
air
and
with
banana
trees
heavy
with
golden
fruit
but
though
rangi
walked
all
that
day
and
the
next
he
saw
no
human
being
he
heard
no
sounds
except
the
beat
of
the
sea
against
the
shore
and
the
whirring
of
hundreds
of
birds
that
passed
like
flashes
of
blue
green
and
crimson
from
tree
to
tree
and
from
grove
to
grove
softly
the
perfumed
breezes
fanned
his
cheek
and
played
in
his
hair
like
a
lovely
dream
is
this
island
thought
he
but
as
lonely
as
the
sea
on
a
moonlit
night
then
to
comfort
himself
he
threw
back
his
head
and
called
halloo
halloo
and
from
a
pile
of
rocks
overhanging
a
deep
gorge
a
voice
answered
halloo
who
art
thou
cried
rangi
in
wonder
what
is
thy
name
and
the
voice
answered
more
softly
what
is
thy
name
where
art
thou
where
art
thou
hidden
he
shouted
and
the
voice
answered
mockingly
where
art
thou
hidden
then
rangi
in
anger
shouted
fiercely
accursed
be
thou
spirit
and
the
voice
screamed
back
as
if
in
derision
accursed
be
thou
thereupon
rangi
grasped
his
spear
tighter
and
strode
toward
the
rocks
determined
to
punish
the
insolent
one
leaping
from
boulder
to
boulder
he
entered
the
gorge
and
ever
as
he
proceeded
he
shouted
threats
and
ever
the
mocking
voice
answered
from
some
distant
spot
the
gorge
grew
darker
and
narrower
until
rangi
suddenly
found
himself
in
a
cavern
its
walls
and
roof
glittered
with
pendant
crystals
from
which
fell
drop
by
drop
clear
water
like
dew
a
white
mist
rose
from
the
rocky
floor
and
through
it
rangi
saw
dimly
a
lovely
fairy
face
gazing
roguishly
at
him
it
was
wreathed
in
rippling
hair
and
crowned
with
flowers
archly
it
smiled
then
melted
away
in
the
mist
who
art
thou
whispered
rangi
in
awe
art
thou
echo
indeed
and
from
the
glittering
walls
and
roof
came
a
thousand
sweet
answers
echo
indeed
the
isles
of
the
sea
fairies
among
the
isles
of
the
golden
mist
i
lived
for
many
a
year
and
all
that
chanced
unto
me
there
tis
well
that
ye
should
hear
i
dwelt
in
a
hall
of
silvery
pearl
with
inlaid
i
sate
on
a
throne
old
as
the
sea
of
the
ruby
coral
made
they
made
me
king
of
the
fairy
isles
that
lie
in
the
golden
mist
where
the
coral
rocks
and
the
silvery
sand
by
singing
waves
are
kissed
far
off
in
the
ocean
solitudes
they
lie
a
glorious
seven
like
a
beautiful
group
of
sister
stars
in
the
untraced
heights
of
heaven
oh
beautiful
isles
where
the
coral
rocks
like
an
ancient
temple
stand
like
a
temple
of
wondrous
workmanship
for
a
lofty
worship
planned
oh
beautiful
isles
and
a
fairy
race
as
the
dream
of
a
poet
fair
now
hold
the
place
by
a
charmèd
spell
with
power
o
er
sea
and
air
their
boats
are
made
of
the
large
that
the
waters
cast
to
land
with
carvèd
prows
more
richly
wrought
than
works
of
mortal
hand
they
skim
along
the
silver
waves
without
or
sail
or
oar
whenever
the
fairy
voyager
would
the
comes
to
shore
i
loved
that
idle
life
for
a
time
but
when
that
time
was
by
i
pined
again
for
another
change
for
the
love
in
a
human
eye
they
brought
me
then
a
glorious
form
and
gave
her
for
my
bride
i
looked
on
her
and
straight
forgot
that
i
was
to
earth
allied
for
many
a
year
and
more
i
dwelt
in
those
isles
of
soft
delight
where
all
was
kind
and
beautiful
with
neither
death
nor
night
we
danced
on
the
sands
when
the
silver
moon
through
the
coral
arches
gleamed
and
pathways
broad
of
glittering
light
o
er
the
azure
waters
streamed
then
shot
forth
many
a
pearly
boat
like
stars
across
the
sea
and
songs
were
sung
and
shells
were
blown
that
set
wild
music
free
for
many
a
year
and
more
i
dwelt
with
neither
thought
nor
care
till
i
forgot
almost
my
speech
forgot
both
creed
and
prayer
at
length
it
chanced
that
as
my
boat
went
on
its
charmèd
way
i
came
unto
the
veil
of
mist
which
round
the
seven
isles
lay
even
then
it
was
a
sabbath
morn
a
ship
was
passing
by
and
i
heard
a
hundred
voices
raise
a
sound
of
psalmody
a
mighty
love
came
o
er
my
heart
a
yearning
toward
my
kind
and
unwittingly
i
spoke
aloud
the
impulse
of
my
mind
oh
take
me
hence
ye
christian
men
i
cried
in
spiritual
want
anon
the
golden
mist
gave
way
that
had
been
like
adamant
the
little
boat
wherein
i
sate
seemed
all
to
melt
away
and
i
was
left
upon
the
sea
like
peter
in
dismay
those
christian
mariners
amazed
looked
on
me
in
affright
some
cried
i
was
an
evil
ghost
and
some
a
but
the
chaplain
seized
the
vessel
s
boat
with
mercy
prompt
and
boon
and
took
me
up
into
the
ship
as
i
fell
into
a
swoon
in
vain
i
told
of
what
had
happed
no
man
to
me
would
list
they
jested
at
the
fairy
isles
and
at
the
golden
mist
they
swore
i
was
a
shipwrecked
man
tossed
on
the
dreary
main
and
pitied
me
because
they
thought
my
woes
had
crazed
my
brain
and
soon
a
wondrous
thing
i
saw
i
now
was
old
and
gray
a
man
of
threescore
years
and
ten
a
weak
man
in
decay
and
yesterday
and
i
was
young
time
did
not
leave
a
trace
upon
my
form
whilst
i
abode
within
the
charmèd
place
away
away
to
fairyland
we
that
live
in
fairyland
no
sickness
know
nor
pain
i
quit
my
body
when
i
will
and
take
to
it
shapes
and
size
we
can
convert
to
either
large
or
small
an
old
s
the
same
to
us
as
is
the
lofty
sleep
in
soft
and
sweet
we
revel
in
the
stream
we
wanton
lightly
on
the
wind
or
glide
on
a
the
magic
ferns
not
many
years
since
there
lived
in
cornwall
a
pretty
young
girl
named
cherry
as
she
and
her
mother
were
poor
cherry
determined
to
go
out
to
service
so
one
morning
early
she
took
her
little
bundle
of
clothes
and
started
out
to
find
a
place
with
some
respectable
family
she
walked
until
she
came
to
four
and
not
knowing
which
to
follow
she
sat
down
on
a
boulder
to
think
the
spot
where
she
sat
was
covered
with
beautiful
ferns
that
curled
their
delicate
fronds
over
the
boulder
and
while
she
was
lost
in
thought
she
unconsciously
picked
a
few
fronds
and
crushed
them
in
her
hand
immediately
she
heard
a
strange
voice
at
her
elbow
say
my
pretty
young
woman
what
are
you
looking
for
she
glanced
up
and
saw
standing
near
her
a
handsome
young
man
who
was
holding
a
bunch
of
the
ferns
i
am
looking
for
a
place
sir
said
she
and
what
kind
of
a
place
do
you
wish
asked
he
with
a
sweet
and
winning
smile
i
am
not
particular
answered
she
i
can
make
myself
generally
indeed
said
the
stranger
and
do
you
think
you
could
look
after
one
little
boy
that
i
d
love
to
do
said
she
smiling
then
replied
he
i
wish
to
hire
you
for
a
year
and
a
day
my
home
is
not
far
from
here
will
you
go
with
me
cherry
and
see
it
cherry
stared
in
astonishment
to
hear
him
speak
her
name
and
he
added
oh
i
see
you
thought
that
i
did
not
know
you
i
watched
you
one
day
while
you
were
dressing
your
hair
beside
one
of
my
ponds
and
i
saw
you
pluck
some
of
my
violets
to
put
in
those
lovely
tresses
but
will
you
go
with
me
cherry
for
a
year
and
a
day
asked
she
you
need
not
be
alarmed
said
he
very
kindly
just
kiss
the
fern
leaf
that
is
in
your
hand
and
say
a
year
and
a
day
i
promise
to
stay
is
that
all
said
cherry
so
she
kissed
the
fern
leaf
and
said
the
words
as
he
told
her
to
instantly
the
young
man
passed
the
bunch
of
ferns
that
he
held
over
both
her
eyes
the
ground
in
front
of
her
seemed
to
open
and
though
she
did
not
feel
herself
move
from
the
boulder
where
she
sat
yet
she
knew
that
she
was
going
down
rapidly
into
the
earth
here
we
are
cherry
said
the
young
man
is
there
a
tear
of
sorrow
under
your
eyelid
if
so
let
me
wipe
it
away
for
no
human
tear
can
enter
our
and
as
he
spoke
he
brushed
cherry
s
eyes
with
the
fern
leaves
and
lo
before
her
was
such
a
country
as
she
had
never
dreamed
of
hills
and
valleys
were
covered
with
flowers
strangely
brilliant
so
that
the
whole
country
appeared
to
be
sown
with
gems
that
glittered
in
a
light
as
clear
as
that
of
the
summer
sun
yet
as
mild
as
moonshine
there
were
glimmering
rivers
and
singing
waterfalls
and
sparkling
fountains
while
everywhere
beautiful
little
ladies
and
gentlemen
dressed
in
green
and
gold
were
walking
or
sitting
on
banks
of
flowers
oh
it
was
a
wonderful
world
here
we
are
at
home
said
the
young
man
and
strangely
enough
he
was
changed
he
had
become
the
handsomest
little
man
cherry
had
ever
seen
and
he
wore
a
green
silk
coat
covered
with
spangles
of
gold
he
led
her
into
a
noble
mansion
the
furniture
of
which
was
of
ivory
and
pearl
inlaid
with
gold
and
silver
and
studded
with
emeralds
after
passing
through
many
rooms
they
came
to
one
whose
walls
were
hung
with
lace
as
fine
as
the
finest
cobwebs
and
most
beautifully
twined
with
flowers
in
the
middle
of
the
room
was
a
cradle
of
wrought
reflecting
so
many
colours
that
cherry
could
scarcely
bear
to
look
at
it
the
little
man
led
her
to
this
and
in
it
was
lying
asleep
a
little
boy
so
beautiful
that
he
ravished
the
sight
this
is
your
charge
said
the
little
man
i
am
king
of
this
country
and
i
wish
my
son
to
know
something
of
human
nature
you
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
wash
and
dress
the
boy
when
he
wakes
to
take
him
walking
in
the
garden
to
tell
him
stories
and
to
put
him
to
sleep
when
he
is
cherry
was
delighted
beyond
words
for
at
first
sight
she
loved
the
darling
little
boy
and
when
he
woke
he
seemed
to
love
her
just
as
dearly
she
was
very
happy
and
cared
tenderly
for
him
and
the
time
passed
away
with
astonishing
rapidity
in
fact
it
seemed
scarcely
a
week
later
when
she
opened
her
eyes
and
found
everything
about
her
changed
indeed
there
she
was
lying
in
her
own
bed
in
her
mother
s
cottage
she
heard
her
mother
calling
her
name
with
joy
and
the
neighbours
came
crowding
around
her
bed
it
was
just
one
year
and
a
day
from
the
time
when
she
had
sat
on
the
boulder
and
had
met
the
fine
young
man
she
told
her
adventures
to
all
but
they
would
not
believe
her
they
shook
their
heads
and
went
away
saying
poor
cherry
is
certainly
mad
from
that
day
on
she
was
never
happy
but
sat
pining
and
dreaming
of
the
hour
when
she
had
picked
the
magic
ferns
and
though
she
often
went
back
to
the
boulder
she
never
again
saw
the
young
man
nor
found
the
way
to
fairyland
the
smith
and
the
fairies
years
ago
there
lived
in
scotland
an
honest
smith
he
had
only
one
child
a
boy
fourteen
years
of
age
cheerful
strong
and
healthy
suddenly
the
boy
fell
ill
he
took
to
his
bed
and
moped
away
whole
days
no
one
could
tell
what
was
the
matter
with
him
although
he
had
a
tremendous
appetite
he
wasted
away
getting
thin
yellow
and
old
at
last
one
morning
while
the
smith
was
standing
idly
at
his
forge
with
no
heart
for
work
he
was
surprised
to
see
a
who
lived
at
some
distance
enter
his
shop
the
smith
hastened
to
tell
him
about
his
son
and
to
ask
his
advice
the
listened
gravely
then
said
the
boy
has
been
carried
away
by
the
little
people
and
they
have
left
a
changeling
in
his
alas
and
what
am
i
to
do
asked
the
smith
how
am
i
ever
to
see
my
own
son
again
i
will
tell
you
how
answered
the
but
first
to
make
sure
that
it
is
not
your
own
son
you
have
gather
together
all
the
you
can
get
go
into
the
room
where
the
boy
is
and
spread
them
out
carefully
before
him
then
pour
water
in
them
and
carry
them
carefully
in
your
hands
two
by
two
carry
them
as
though
they
were
very
heavy
and
arrange
them
around
the
the
smith
accordingly
collected
as
many
as
he
could
find
he
went
into
the
room
and
did
as
the
had
said
he
had
not
been
long
at
work
before
there
came
from
the
bed
where
the
boy
lay
a
great
shout
of
laughter
and
the
boy
cried
out
i
am
now
eight
hundred
years
old
and
i
have
never
seen
the
like
of
that
before
the
smith
hurried
back
and
told
this
to
the
did
i
not
assure
you
said
the
that
it
is
not
your
son
whom
you
have
your
son
is
in
a
fairy
mound
not
far
from
here
get
rid
as
soon
as
possible
of
this
changeling
and
i
think
i
may
promise
you
your
son
again
you
must
light
a
very
great
and
bright
fire
before
the
bed
on
which
this
stranger
is
lying
he
will
ask
you
why
you
are
doing
so
answer
him
at
once
you
shall
see
presently
when
i
lay
you
upon
if
you
do
this
the
changeling
will
become
frightened
and
fly
through
the
the
smith
again
followed
the
s
advice
kindled
a
blazing
fire
and
answered
as
he
had
been
told
to
do
and
just
as
he
was
going
to
seize
the
changeling
and
fling
him
on
the
fire
the
thing
gave
an
awful
yell
and
sprang
through
the
roof
the
smith
overjoyed
returned
to
the
and
told
this
to
him
on
midsummer
night
said
the
the
fairy
mound
where
your
boy
is
kept
will
open
you
must
provide
yourself
with
a
dirk
and
a
crowing
cock
go
to
the
mound
you
will
hear
singing
and
dancing
and
much
merriment
going
on
at
twelve
o
clock
a
door
in
the
mound
will
open
advance
boldly
enter
this
door
but
first
stick
the
dirk
in
the
ground
before
it
to
prevent
the
mound
from
closing
you
will
find
yourself
in
a
spacious
apartment
beautifully
clean
and
there
working
at
a
forge
you
will
see
your
son
the
fairies
will
then
question
you
and
you
must
answer
that
you
have
come
for
your
son
and
will
not
go
without
him
do
this
and
see
what
happens
midsummer
night
came
and
the
smith
provided
himself
with
a
dirk
and
a
crowing
cock
he
went
to
the
fairy
mound
and
all
happened
as
the
had
said
the
fairies
came
crowding
around
him
buzzing
and
pinching
his
legs
and
when
he
said
that
he
had
come
for
his
son
and
would
not
go
away
without
him
they
all
gave
a
loud
laugh
at
the
same
minute
the
cock
that
was
dozing
in
the
smith
s
arms
woke
up
it
leaped
to
his
shoulder
and
clapping
its
wings
crowed
loud
and
long
at
that
the
fairies
were
furious
they
seized
the
smith
and
his
son
and
threw
them
out
of
the
mound
and
pulled
up
the
dirk
and
flung
it
after
them
and
in
an
instant
all
was
dark
for
a
year
and
a
day
the
boy
never
spoke
nor
would
he
do
a
turn
of
work
at
last
one
morning
as
he
was
watching
his
father
finish
a
sword
he
exclaimed
that
s
not
the
way
to
do
it
and
taking
the
tools
from
his
father
s
hands
he
set
to
work
and
soon
fashioned
a
glittering
sharp
sword
the
like
of
which
had
never
been
seen
before
from
that
day
on
the
boy
helped
his
father
and
showed
him
how
to
make
fairy
swords
and
in
a
few
years
they
both
became
rich
and
famous
and
they
always
lived
together
contentedly
and
happily
the
steed
late
one
night
a
bright
quiet
moonlit
night
old
dame
moll
lay
snugly
sleeping
in
her
bed
when
suddenly
she
was
wakened
by
a
noise
like
a
rushing
storm
the
next
minute
there
came
a
loud
rap
rap
at
her
cottage
door
startled
and
frightened
she
sprang
out
of
bed
and
opened
the
door
on
a
crack
don
t
be
afraid
good
woman
said
a
squeaky
voice
open
wide
open
wide
so
she
opened
a
bit
wider
and
saw
a
strange
ugly
little
fellow
standing
on
the
somehow
the
look
in
his
eyes
seemed
to
cast
a
spell
over
her
and
made
her
open
the
door
very
wide
my
wife
has
sent
for
you
good
woman
said
he
you
must
come
with
me
and
bathe
and
dress
our
your
wife
thought
the
poor
dame
heaven
defend
me
sure
as
i
live
i
am
going
to
care
for
a
little
imp
but
she
could
not
refuse
to
go
for
the
spell
in
the
little
man
s
eyes
drew
her
and
she
was
forced
to
walk
toward
a
steed
that
stood
snorting
before
the
door
its
eyes
were
balls
and
its
breath
was
like
smoke
and
how
dame
moll
got
to
the
place
she
never
could
tell
but
suddenly
she
found
herself
set
down
by
a
neat
but
poor
cottage
and
saw
two
tidy
children
playing
before
the
door
in
a
minute
she
was
seated
in
front
of
a
roaring
washing
and
dressing
a
small
baby
but
a
very
active
and
naughty
baby
it
was
though
only
an
hour
old
for
it
lifted
its
fist
and
gave
the
good
dame
such
a
rousing
box
on
her
ear
that
it
made
her
head
ring
anoint
its
eyes
with
this
salve
my
good
woman
said
the
mother
who
was
lying
in
a
neat
white
bed
so
dame
moll
took
the
box
of
salve
and
rubbed
a
bit
on
the
child
s
eyes
why
not
a
drop
on
mine
thought
she
since
it
must
be
elfin
so
she
rubbed
her
finger
over
her
right
eye
o
ye
powers
of
fairyland
what
did
she
see
the
neat
but
homely
cottage
had
become
a
great
and
beautiful
room
the
mother
dressed
in
white
silk
lay
in
an
ivory
bed
the
babe
was
robed
in
silvery
gauze
the
two
older
children
who
had
just
come
into
the
cottage
were
seated
one
on
either
side
of
the
mother
s
pillow
but
they
too
were
changed
for
now
they
were
little
imps
who
with
mops
and
mows
and
with
many
a
grin
and
grimace
were
pulling
the
mother
s
ears
with
their
long
hairy
paws
when
dame
moll
saw
this
she
knew
that
she
was
in
a
place
of
enchantment
and
without
saying
a
word
about
having
anointed
her
own
eye
she
made
haste
to
finish
dressing
the
elfin
babe
then
the
little
old
fellow
once
more
placed
her
behind
him
on
the
steed
and
away
they
went
sailing
through
the
air
and
he
set
her
down
safely
before
her
door
on
the
next
when
dame
moll
was
selling
eggs
what
did
she
see
but
the
little
old
fellow
himself
busied
like
a
rogue
stealing
some
things
from
the
oh
ho
cried
she
i
ve
caught
you
you
thief
what
exclaimed
he
do
you
see
me
see
you
to
be
sure
i
do
as
plain
as
the
sun
in
the
sky
and
i
see
you
very
busy
stealing
into
the
bargain
with
which
eye
do
you
see
me
said
he
with
my
right
eye
to
be
sure
answered
dame
moll
the
ointment
the
ointment
exclaimed
the
little
man
take
that
for
meddling
with
what
did
not
belong
to
you
and
he
struck
her
in
the
eye
as
he
spoke
and
from
that
day
to
this
old
dame
moll
has
been
blind
in
the
right
eye
and
surely
it
served
her
right
for
stealing
the
fairy
ointment
the
girl
who
was
stolen
by
the
fairies
never
go
near
an
elfin
mound
on
may
day
for
in
the
month
of
may
the
fairies
are
very
powerful
and
they
wander
about
the
meadows
looking
for
pretty
maidens
to
carry
off
to
fairyland
one
beautiful
may
day
in
old
ireland
a
young
girl
fell
asleep
at
noonday
on
an
elfin
mound
the
fairies
saw
how
pretty
she
was
so
they
carried
her
off
to
fairyland
and
left
in
her
stead
an
image
that
looked
exactly
like
her
evening
fell
and
as
the
girl
did
not
return
home
her
mother
sent
the
neighbours
to
look
for
her
in
all
directions
they
found
the
image
and
thinking
that
it
was
the
girl
herself
they
carried
it
home
and
laid
it
in
her
bed
but
the
image
neither
moved
nor
spoke
and
lay
there
silently
for
two
days
on
the
morning
of
the
third
day
an
old
entered
the
house
and
looking
at
the
image
said
your
daughter
is
rub
this
ointment
on
her
forehead
and
see
what
you
shall
see
then
the
old
woman
placed
a
vial
of
green
ointment
in
the
mother
s
hand
and
disappeared
the
mother
immediately
rubbed
the
forehead
of
the
image
and
the
girl
herself
sat
up
in
bed
weeping
and
wringing
her
hands
oh
mother
she
cried
oh
why
did
you
bring
me
back
i
was
so
happy
i
was
in
a
beautiful
palace
where
handsome
princesses
and
princes
were
dancing
to
the
sweetest
music
they
made
me
dance
with
them
and
threw
a
mantle
of
rich
gold
over
my
shoulders
now
it
is
all
gone
and
i
shall
never
see
the
beautiful
palace
any
more
then
the
mother
wept
and
said
oh
my
child
stay
with
me
i
have
no
other
daughter
but
you
and
if
the
fairies
take
you
i
shall
die
the
girl
wept
loudly
at
this
and
throwing
her
arms
around
her
mother
s
neck
kissed
her
and
promised
that
she
would
not
go
near
the
elfin
mound
and
she
kept
her
word
so
she
never
saw
the
fairies
again
the
girl
who
danced
with
the
fairies
one
must
never
wander
about
alone
on
hallowe
en
for
then
the
fairies
are
abroad
looking
for
mortals
to
trick
and
lead
astray
now
there
was
once
a
girl
the
prettiest
girl
in
all
ireland
who
late
one
hallowe
en
was
going
to
a
spring
to
fetch
some
water
her
foot
slipped
and
she
fell
when
she
got
up
she
looked
about
her
and
saw
that
she
was
in
a
very
strange
place
a
great
fire
was
burning
near
around
which
a
number
of
people
beautifully
dressed
were
dancing
a
handsome
young
man
like
a
prince
with
a
red
sash
and
a
golden
band
in
his
hair
left
the
fire
and
came
toward
her
he
greeted
her
kindly
and
asked
her
to
dance
it
is
a
foolish
thing
sir
to
ask
me
to
dance
replied
she
since
there
is
no
at
that
the
young
man
lifted
his
hand
and
instantly
the
most
delicious
music
sounded
then
he
took
her
by
the
fingers
and
drew
her
into
the
dance
around
and
around
they
whirled
and
they
danced
and
danced
until
the
moon
and
stars
went
down
and
all
the
time
the
girl
seemed
to
float
in
the
air
and
she
forgot
everything
except
the
sweet
music
and
the
young
man
at
last
the
dancing
ceased
and
a
door
opened
in
the
earth
the
young
man
who
seemed
to
be
the
king
of
all
led
the
girl
down
a
pair
of
stairs
followed
by
all
the
gay
company
at
the
end
of
a
long
passage
they
came
to
a
hall
bright
and
beautiful
with
gold
and
silver
and
lights
a
table
was
covered
with
every
good
thing
to
eat
and
wine
was
poured
out
in
golden
cups
the
young
man
lifted
a
cup
and
offered
it
to
the
girl
at
the
same
moment
some
one
whispered
in
her
ear
do
not
drink
do
not
eat
if
you
do
either
you
will
never
see
your
home
again
well
the
girl
when
she
heard
that
set
the
cup
down
and
refused
to
drink
immediately
all
the
company
grew
angry
a
great
buzzing
arose
the
lights
went
out
and
the
girl
felt
something
grasp
her
and
rush
her
forth
from
the
hall
and
up
the
stairs
and
in
a
minute
she
found
herself
beside
the
spring
holding
her
pitcher
in
her
hand
she
did
not
wait
for
anything
but
ran
home
as
fast
as
she
could
and
locked
herself
in
tight
and
crept
into
bed
then
she
heard
a
great
clamour
of
little
voices
outside
her
door
and
she
could
hear
them
cry
the
power
we
had
over
you
is
gone
because
you
refused
to
drink
but
wait
until
next
hallowe
en
night
when
you
dance
with
us
on
the
hill
then
we
shall
keep
you
forever
forever
elidore
and
the
golden
ball
once
upon
a
time
in
the
land
of
wales
near
the
fall
of
the
tawe
into
the
sea
there
lived
a
boy
called
elidore
he
was
a
bright
lad
but
so
fond
of
play
that
he
would
not
study
at
all
his
teacher
flogged
him
so
often
and
so
hard
that
one
morning
elidore
ran
away
from
home
and
hid
under
a
hollow
bank
by
the
side
of
the
river
there
he
stayed
two
nights
and
two
days
getting
hungrier
and
thirstier
every
moment
at
last
when
it
seemed
as
if
he
could
stand
his
sufferings
no
longer
he
saw
a
little
door
open
in
the
side
of
the
bank
and
two
elfin
men
step
out
they
stood
before
him
and
bowing
low
said
come
with
us
dear
boy
and
we
will
lead
you
to
a
land
full
of
delights
and
sports
where
you
may
play
all
the
elidore
was
overjoyed
he
rose
and
followed
the
elfin
men
through
the
door
they
conducted
him
down
a
long
dark
passage
through
the
hill
at
length
they
came
out
into
a
beautiful
country
adorned
with
singing
crystal
streams
and
flowery
meadows
but
it
was
always
twilight
there
for
the
light
of
the
sun
moon
and
stars
could
not
reach
that
land
the
elfin
men
led
elidore
to
a
golden
palace
and
presented
him
to
the
king
of
the
elves
who
was
seated
upon
his
throne
and
was
surrounded
by
a
train
of
little
people
richly
clad
the
king
questioned
elidore
kindly
then
calling
his
eldest
son
the
elfin
prince
bade
him
take
the
and
make
him
happy
so
elidore
dwelt
in
elfinland
and
day
after
day
was
fed
with
milk
and
saffron
and
he
played
with
the
elfin
prince
tossing
gold
and
silver
balls
when
he
walked
in
the
meadows
to
pick
flowers
he
saw
everywhere
about
him
the
elfin
people
with
long
flowing
yellow
hair
riding
on
little
horses
and
chasing
tiny
deer
with
fairy
hounds
for
all
the
people
in
elfinland
played
and
rode
about
night
and
day
and
they
never
worked
sometimes
on
moonlit
nights
they
rode
through
the
dark
passage
to
the
upper
world
and
danced
in
fairy
rings
on
the
grass
and
when
they
went
to
their
dances
they
took
elidore
with
them
after
elidore
had
lived
in
elfinland
for
some
time
the
king
permitted
him
one
moonlit
night
to
go
alone
through
the
dark
passage
to
visit
his
mother
he
did
so
and
she
was
delighted
to
see
him
for
she
had
thought
him
dead
he
told
her
about
the
wonders
of
elfinland
and
how
he
was
fed
on
milk
and
saffron
and
played
with
gold
and
silver
toys
she
begged
him
the
next
time
he
came
to
bring
her
a
bit
of
fairy
gold
he
promised
to
do
so
and
returned
to
elfinland
it
so
happened
one
day
soon
after
this
that
elidore
was
playing
with
the
elfin
prince
he
snatched
a
beautiful
golden
ball
from
the
prince
s
hands
and
hastened
with
it
through
the
dark
passage
as
he
ran
he
heard
behind
him
the
shouts
of
many
angry
elves
and
the
sound
of
their
horses
hoofs
and
the
barking
of
the
fairy
dogs
and
knew
that
he
was
being
pursued
faster
he
ran
in
terror
but
nearer
came
the
patter
of
a
thousand
little
feet
and
the
elfin
shouts
still
more
terrified
he
rushed
through
the
door
in
the
hill
and
sped
homeward
as
he
sprang
into
his
mother
s
house
his
foot
caught
and
he
fell
over
the
threshold
at
the
same
moment
two
elves
who
had
outrun
the
others
leaped
over
him
and
snatched
the
golden
ball
from
his
hands
thief
robber
thief
they
screamed
and
vanished
as
for
elidore
he
rose
up
too
ashamed
to
eat
or
sleep
that
night
the
next
day
he
went
to
the
river
bank
and
searched
for
the
door
but
could
find
no
trace
of
it
and
though
he
searched
every
day
for
a
year
he
never
again
found
the
entrance
to
elfinland
but
from
that
time
he
was
a
changed
boy
he
studied
hard
loved
truth
and
hated
lying
and
stealing
and
when
he
grew
up
he
became
a
great
man
in
wales
at
the
court
of
fairyland

once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
gentleman
who
married
for
his
second
wife
a
woman
who
was
the
haughtiest
and
proudest
ever
seen
she
had
two
daughters
who
resembled
her
in
temper
the
husband
however
had
a
young
daughter
by
his
first
wife
who
was
of
a
sweetness
and
goodness
without
limit
she
was
like
her
own
mother
who
had
been
the
most
woman
in
the
world
the
wedding
was
no
sooner
over
than
the
stepmother
began
to
show
her
bad
disposition
she
could
not
endure
the
young
girl
whose
sweetness
made
her
own
daughters
seem
more
detestable
she
forced
her
to
do
the
hardest
work
in
the
house
it
was
she
who
washed
the
dishes
and
put
them
in
their
places
it
was
she
who
polished
the
bedroom
floors
for
her
stepmother
and
two
sisters
she
slept
under
the
eaves
in
a
garret
on
a
wretched
mattress
while
her
sisters
lay
in
elegant
rooms
where
the
beds
were
soft
and
white
and
the
walls
were
lined
with
long
mirrors
in
which
the
sisters
could
see
themselves
from
head
to
foot
the
poor
girl
suffered
all
this
with
patience
and
she
did
not
dare
complain
to
her
father
for
he
would
have
scolded
her
as
he
was
completely
governed
by
his
wife
each
day
after
the
girl
had
finished
her
work
she
sat
down
in
the
among
the
cinders
so
they
called
her
cinderella
nevertheless
cinderella
in
spite
of
her
shabby
clothes
was
more
polite
and
a
hundred
times
more
beautiful
than
her
sisters
although
they
were
magnificently
dressed
it
happened
one
day
that
the
king
s
son
gave
a
ball
and
that
he
invited
everybody
of
rank
the
ugly
sisters
were
also
invited
because
they
always
made
a
grand
figure
at
all
court
festivities
they
were
very
glad
at
the
thought
of
attending
the
royal
ball
and
busied
themselves
in
choosing
the
robes
and
which
should
be
most
becoming
but
alas
it
was
more
trouble
and
work
for
cinderella
for
it
was
she
who
did
her
sisters
ironing
and
fluted
their
ruffles
night
and
morning
they
talked
only
of
their
clothes
i
said
the
eldest
shall
wear
my
red
velvet
robe
with
rich
lace
i
said
the
younger
shall
have
only
my
plain
skirt
but
to
make
up
for
its
plainness
i
shall
put
on
my
cloak
flowered
with
gold
and
my
tiara
of
they
called
in
cinderella
to
ask
her
advice
for
she
had
excellent
taste
cinderella
gave
them
the
best
counsel
in
the
world
and
even
offered
to
do
their
hair
for
which
they
were
very
glad
and
while
she
was
arranging
their
locks
in
two
rows
of
puffs
they
asked
cinderella
would
you
not
be
delighted
to
go
to
the
ball
alas
you
are
mocking
me
replied
she
it
would
be
no
place
for
me
you
are
right
answered
the
sisters
laughing
scornfully
everybody
would
laugh
well
to
see
such
a
as
you
at
the
ball
any
one
but
cinderella
would
have
done
their
hair
crooked
out
of
rage
but
she
was
so
sweet
that
she
did
her
very
best
they
went
two
days
without
eating
so
excited
were
they
with
joy
they
broke
a
dozen
lacings
trying
to
make
their
waists
smaller
and
they
spent
all
their
time
before
the
mirrors
at
last
the
happy
day
arrived
and
as
they
departed
for
the
ball
cinderella
followed
them
with
her
eyes
as
long
as
she
could
then
she
burst
into
tears
her
godmother
who
saw
her
in
tears
asked
what
was
the
matter
i
wish
i
wish
and
cinderella
sobbed
so
that
she
could
not
finish
her
godmother
who
was
a
fairy
said
you
wish
to
go
to
the
ball
don
t
you
alas
yes
sighed
cinderella
then
be
a
good
girl
said
her
godmother
and
you
shall
go
now
run
into
the
garden
and
bring
me
a
cinderella
went
and
picked
the
biggest
she
could
find
and
as
she
carried
it
to
her
godmother
she
wondered
how
that
pumpkin
could
help
her
go
to
the
ball
her
godmother
scooped
out
all
the
inside
leaving
only
the
rind
which
she
struck
with
her
wand
instantly
it
became
a
golden
coach
then
she
went
to
look
at
the
mousetrap
in
which
she
found
six
mice
she
bade
cinderella
open
the
trap
and
as
each
mouse
sprang
out
she
touched
it
with
her
wand
and
instantly
it
was
changed
into
a
handsome
horse
as
the
godmother
was
wondering
out
of
what
to
make
a
coachman
cinderella
said
i
will
go
and
see
if
there
is
a
rat
in
the
trap
then
we
can
make
a
that
is
a
good
thought
said
her
godmother
go
and
cinderella
brought
the
trap
in
which
were
three
large
rats
her
godmother
chose
one
of
the
three
because
of
his
long
whiskers
and
when
she
touched
him
he
was
instantly
changed
into
a
big
coachman
who
had
the
handsomest
moustaches
ever
seen
then
she
said
to
cinderella
go
into
the
garden
you
will
find
there
six
lizards
behind
the
bring
them
to
cinderella
had
no
sooner
brought
them
than
they
were
changed
into
six
footmen
in
coats
who
sprang
up
behind
the
coach
with
the
air
of
never
having
done
anything
else
in
their
lives
then
the
fairy
said
to
cinderella
here
is
a
fine
coach
in
which
to
go
to
the
ball
are
you
not
glad
yes
replied
she
but
must
i
go
in
these
ugly
clothes
her
godmother
in
answer
touched
her
with
her
wand
and
instantly
her
old
clothes
were
changed
into
robes
of
gold
and
silver
embroidered
with
gems
then
her
godmother
presented
her
with
a
pair
of
glass
slippers
the
prettiest
in
the
world
now
that
cinderella
was
all
dressed
she
got
into
the
coach
but
her
godmother
told
her
above
all
things
not
to
remain
a
minute
later
than
midnight
for
if
she
remained
a
single
minute
longer
her
coach
would
become
a
pumpkin
her
horses
mice
her
coachman
a
rat
and
her
footmen
lizards
while
all
her
fine
clothes
would
change
to
rags
cinderella
promised
her
godmother
that
she
would
not
fail
to
return
before
midnight
she
departed
for
the
ball
so
joyful
that
she
did
not
know
herself
the
king
s
son
who
was
informed
by
his
servants
of
the
arrival
of
a
beautiful
princess
whom
nobody
knew
ran
to
receive
her
he
assisted
her
to
descend
from
the
coach
and
led
her
into
the
hall
where
the
guests
were
assembled
there
was
a
great
silence
people
stopped
dancing
and
the
violins
ceased
playing
while
all
crowded
around
to
see
the
beauty
of
the
unknown
one
then
a
confused
murmur
arose
oh
how
beautiful
she
is
the
king
even
old
as
he
was
could
not
take
his
eyes
off
her
and
he
whispered
to
the
queen
that
it
was
long
since
he
had
seen
such
a
handsome
and
amiable
person
all
the
ladies
were
anxious
to
examine
her
and
robes
and
they
decided
to
have
some
made
like
them
the
very
next
morning
provided
of
course
that
they
could
procure
beautiful
enough
materials
and
needlewomen
sufficiently
skilful
the
king
s
son
led
cinderella
to
the
place
of
honour
and
asked
her
to
dance
with
him
she
danced
with
such
grace
that
she
was
more
admired
than
ever
a
superb
banquet
was
served
but
the
young
prince
did
not
taste
it
so
much
was
he
occupied
in
gazing
at
her
she
seated
herself
by
her
sisters
and
showed
them
a
thousand
attentions
she
offered
them
a
share
of
the
oranges
and
lemons
that
the
prince
had
given
her
which
greatly
surprised
them
for
they
did
not
know
her
while
they
were
chatting
cinderella
heard
the
clock
strike
a
quarter
before
twelve
she
immediately
bowed
to
the
company
and
hastened
away
as
fast
as
she
could
when
she
arrived
at
home
she
found
her
fairy
godmother
and
having
thanked
her
told
her
how
she
longed
to
go
again
the
next
night
for
the
prince
had
invited
her
and
while
she
was
relating
all
the
things
that
had
happened
at
the
ball
she
heard
the
two
sisters
rap
at
the
door
cinderella
opened
it
how
late
you
are
she
said
if
you
had
been
at
the
ball
replied
one
of
the
sisters
you
would
not
think
it
late
there
came
the
most
beautiful
princess
you
have
ever
dreamed
of
she
was
devoted
to
us
and
gave
us
oranges
and
cinderella
could
scarcely
contain
herself
for
joy
she
asked
the
name
of
the
princess
we
do
not
know
they
said
even
the
king
s
son
is
curious
to
learn
who
she
cinderella
smiled
and
said
to
the
elder
sister
was
she
so
beautiful
then
how
happy
you
are
the
next
night
the
sisters
went
to
the
ball
cinderella
went
too
even
more
magnificently
attired
than
the
first
time
the
king
s
son
was
constantly
by
her
side
and
never
ceased
whispering
sweet
things
cinderella
was
not
at
all
weary
and
she
forgot
what
her
godmother
had
told
her
so
that
when
she
heard
the
first
stroke
of
midnight
she
could
not
believe
that
it
was
more
than
eleven
o
clock
she
sprang
up
and
fled
as
swiftly
as
a
deer
the
prince
followed
her
but
could
not
catch
her
she
lost
one
of
her
glass
slippers
which
he
tenderly
picked
up
cinderella
reached
home
breathless
without
coach
or
footmen
and
clad
in
rags
nothing
remained
of
all
her
splendour
but
one
little
glass
slipper
for
she
had
dropped
the
other
the
prince
s
attendants
asked
the
palace
guards
if
they
had
seen
a
princess
pass
by
they
said
that
they
had
seen
no
one
except
a
poorly
dressed
girl
who
looked
more
like
a
peasant
than
a
princess
when
her
sisters
returned
cinderella
asked
if
they
had
had
a
good
time
again
and
if
the
lovely
princess
had
been
present
they
said
yes
but
that
she
had
fled
as
soon
as
twelve
o
clock
had
sounded
and
that
she
had
dropped
one
of
her
little
glass
slippers
it
was
the
prettiest
thing
and
that
the
prince
had
picked
it
up
and
that
he
had
done
nothing
but
look
at
it
for
the
rest
of
the
night
assuredly
he
must
be
very
much
in
love
with
the
princess
to
whom
it
belonged
and
they
were
right
a
few
days
after
this
the
king
s
son
sent
a
herald
who
announced
by
sound
of
a
trumpet
that
the
prince
would
marry
any
lady
whom
the
glass
slipper
fitted
then
commenced
a
great
by
princesses
and
duchesses
and
all
the
ladies
of
the
court
but
it
was
of
no
use
at
last
they
brought
the
glass
slipper
to
the
two
sisters
who
did
their
best
to
get
their
feet
into
it
but
they
could
not
do
so
cinderella
who
was
looking
on
and
recognized
her
slipper
said
smilingly
let
me
see
if
it
will
fit
her
sisters
began
to
laugh
scornfully
and
to
ridicule
her
but
the
attendant
who
held
the
slipper
looking
attentively
at
cinderella
saw
that
she
was
very
beautiful
and
said
that
she
had
a
right
to
do
so
for
he
had
been
ordered
to
try
the
slipper
on
every
girl
in
the
kingdom
he
made
cinderella
seat
herself
and
placing
the
slipper
on
her
little
foot
saw
that
it
went
on
easily
and
fitted
her
like
wax
the
amazement
of
the
sisters
was
great
but
was
greater
still
when
cinderella
drew
the
other
slipper
from
her
pocket
and
put
it
on
her
other
foot
immediately
the
fairy
godmother
arrived
and
having
touched
cinderella
s
clothes
with
her
wand
changed
them
into
garments
more
magnificent
than
those
she
had
worn
before
then
the
two
sisters
recognized
her
for
the
beautiful
princess
whom
they
had
seen
at
the
ball
they
threw
themselves
at
her
feet
and
begged
forgiveness
for
the
cruel
treatment
she
had
suffered
cinderella
raised
and
embraced
them
and
assured
them
that
she
pardoned
them
with
all
her
heart
and
that
she
now
entreated
them
to
love
her
dearly
she
was
then
conducted
to
the
palace
of
the
prince
adorned
as
she
was
in
all
her
magnificence
the
prince
found
her
more
beautiful
than
ever
and
a
few
days
after
he
married
her
with
great
pomp
cinderella
who
was
as
good
as
she
was
beautiful
lodged
her
sisters
in
the
palace
and
married
them
on
the
same
day
to
two
great
lords
of
the
court
the
sleeping
beauty
in
the
wood
once
upon
a
time
there
lived
a
king
and
queen
who
were
most
miserable
because
they
had
no
children
but
when
a
lovely
baby
girl
was
born
to
them
they
were
two
of
the
happiest
people
in
the
world
and
in
order
to
make
all
things
as
propitious
as
possible
for
the
little
princess
they
invited
seven
fairies
who
lived
in
the
kingdom
to
be
her
godmothers
when
the
christening
ceremony
was
over
there
was
a
magnificent
banquet
given
for
the
fairies
before
each
of
them
was
laid
a
plate
of
massive
gold
and
a
case
also
of
massive
gold
containing
a
spoon
a
fork
and
a
knife
all
of
the
same
precious
metal
and
richly
studded
with
diamonds
and
rubies
but
just
as
everybody
was
seated
at
the
table
who
should
enter
but
an
old
fairy
who
had
not
been
invited
because
for
more
than
fifty
years
she
had
been
shut
up
in
a
tower
and
was
supposed
to
be
either
dead
or
enchanted
the
king
immediately
commanded
that
a
chair
should
be
placed
for
her
at
the
table
but
he
could
not
offer
her
a
golden
plate
and
case
for
only
seven
had
been
made
for
the
seven
fairies
the
unreasonable
old
creature
considered
herself
insulted
and
began
to
mutter
frightful
threats
between
her
teeth
the
youngest
of
the
fairies
hearing
this
concealed
herself
behind
the
tapestry
in
order
to
be
the
last
to
speak
and
so
perhaps
prevent
any
harm
being
done
to
the
little
princess
meanwhile
the
godmothers
began
to
bestow
their
gifts
one
said
my
godchild
shall
be
the
most
beautiful
girl
in
the
whole
the
second
added
and
she
shall
have
the
disposition
of
an
the
third
said
i
give
her
the
gift
of
perfect
grace
and
the
fourth
added
and
she
shall
dance
like
a
the
fifth
said
she
shall
sing
like
a
the
sixth
added
she
shall
excel
in
playing
on
every
sort
of
musical
then
came
the
turn
of
the
old
fairy
who
screamed
like
a
cockatoo
while
her
head
shook
more
from
rage
than
from
age
the
princess
shall
pierce
her
hand
with
a
spindle
and
shall
die
these
dreadful
words
made
the
whole
company
every
one
shudder
and
there
was
no
one
there
who
was
not
drowned
in
tears
at
that
moment
the
youngest
fairy
appeared
from
behind
the
tapestry
and
said
sweetly
do
not
weep
your
majesties
your
daughter
will
not
die
it
is
true
that
i
have
not
power
enough
to
entirely
undo
the
evil
that
my
elder
sister
has
done
the
princess
will
hurt
her
hand
with
a
spindle
but
instead
of
dying
she
will
fall
asleep
for
a
hundred
years
and
then
a
royal
prince
will
come
and
waken
the
king
hoping
to
prevent
this
calamity
forbade
any
person
in
the
kingdom
either
to
spin
or
even
to
keep
a
spindle
in
the
house
any
one
who
disobeyed
was
to
be
punished
with
death
sixteen
years
after
this
the
king
and
queen
went
with
their
court
to
a
castle
in
the
country
when
it
happened
that
the
young
princess
wandering
curiously
from
room
to
room
mounted
to
the
top
of
a
tower
there
she
found
an
old
woman
sitting
alone
before
her
wheel
this
old
woman
had
never
heard
that
the
king
had
forbidden
any
one
to
spin
what
are
you
doing
my
good
mother
asked
the
princess
i
am
spinning
my
beautiful
child
answered
the
old
woman
oh
how
pretty
it
is
exclaimed
the
princess
how
do
you
do
it
give
that
to
me
so
i
may
see
if
i
can
do
as
well
and
as
she
spoke
she
took
the
spindle
so
eagerly
and
so
quickly
that
it
pierced
her
hand
and
she
sank
fainting
to
the
floor
the
poor
old
woman
in
the
greatest
distress
cried
for
help
people
came
hurrying
from
all
sides
they
dashed
water
on
the
princess
they
unlaced
her
robes
they
bathed
her
temples
with
perfumes
but
she
did
not
move
then
the
king
who
hearing
the
commotion
was
come
into
the
remembered
the
malediction
of
the
old
fairy
he
perceived
that
the
misfortune
was
a
thing
that
had
to
come
about
since
the
fairies
had
foretold
it
he
caused
the
princess
to
be
carried
to
the
most
splendid
apartment
in
the
castle
and
to
be
laid
on
a
couch
of
down
and
on
pillows
of
down
embroidered
with
gold
and
silver
her
eyes
were
closed
but
her
soft
breathing
showed
that
she
was
not
dead
then
too
her
cheeks
were
flushed
a
delicate
and
her
lips
were
like
coral
she
seemed
a
sleeping
angel
she
was
so
beautiful
the
kind
fairy
who
had
saved
the
princess
s
life
was
in
the
kingdom
of
mataquin
twelve
thousand
miles
away
but
the
king
instantly
sent
word
of
the
misfortune
by
a
little
dwarf
who
travelled
in
boots
which
are
boots
that
pass
over
seven
leagues
at
each
step
and
she
arrived
directly
at
the
castle
in
a
chariot
of
fire
drawn
by
dragons
she
approved
of
all
that
the
king
had
done
but
being
exceedingly
wise
she
knew
that
the
poor
princess
would
be
in
a
pitiable
condition
when
at
the
end
of
a
hundred
years
she
awoke
to
find
herself
alone
in
that
old
castle
she
knew
of
but
one
thing
to
do
and
she
did
it
at
a
wave
of
her
wand
every
one
fell
asleep
ladies
of
honour
squires
pages
stewards
cooks
scullions
porters
footmen
every
breathing
thing
even
the
horses
in
the
stables
with
the
grooms
the
mastiffs
in
the
courtyard
and
little
pouffi
the
princess
s
lap
dog
who
was
nestling
beside
her
on
the
couch
all
slept
the
spits
full
of
partridges
over
the
fire
and
even
the
fire
itself
waited
silently
to
serve
their
mistress
when
she
should
wake
and
need
them
only
the
king
and
queen
were
left
to
kiss
their
darling
child
and
go
away
from
the
castle
the
king
forbade
any
one
to
approach
the
place
but
this
command
was
not
necessary
for
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
there
was
grown
up
around
the
castle
park
such
a
vast
wood
whose
trees
great
and
small
were
so
interlaced
with
briars
and
thorns
that
neither
man
nor
beast
could
pass
through
it
was
plain
that
the
fairy
had
arranged
matters
after
fairy
fashion
taking
care
that
the
young
princess
should
not
be
disturbed
while
she
slept
when
the
hundred
years
were
gone
a
king
not
of
the
family
of
the
princess
reigned
over
the
land
one
day
his
son
was
hunting
near
the
fairy
wood
and
asked
what
were
those
turrets
he
saw
rising
above
the
trees
people
told
him
everything
that
they
had
heard
one
said
that
it
was
an
enchanted
castle
another
said
that
all
the
witches
in
the
country
held
their
revels
there
the
most
common
belief
however
seemed
to
be
that
it
was
the
of
an
ogre
who
carried
off
all
the
children
he
could
catch
and
devoured
them
at
his
leisure
for
no
one
could
follow
him
as
only
he
could
pass
through
the
wood
while
the
prince
was
lost
in
wonder
at
these
tales
an
old
peasant
approached
him
and
said
your
highness
more
than
fifty
years
ago
i
heard
my
father
say
that
in
yonder
castle
was
the
most
beautiful
princess
on
earth
and
that
she
would
sleep
a
hundred
years
and
then
be
wakened
by
the
son
of
a
king
and
that
she
would
marry
that
was
enough
to
set
the
prince
on
fire
for
the
adventure
in
fact
he
felt
in
his
heart
that
he
was
the
chosen
one
he
did
not
delay
for
an
instant
no
sooner
had
he
taken
a
step
toward
the
wood
than
the
trees
great
and
small
and
the
thorns
and
briars
disentangled
themselves
and
opened
a
path
he
walked
toward
the
castle
which
stood
at
the
end
of
a
broad
avenue
he
saw
with
surprise
that
none
of
his
attendants
had
been
able
to
follow
him
for
the
wood
had
closed
again
behind
him
but
all
the
same
he
went
on
boldly
he
entered
a
spacious
outer
court
where
a
person
less
brave
than
he
would
have
been
paralyzed
by
fear
a
deathlike
silence
reigned
and
many
dead
men
lay
stretched
upon
the
ground
but
the
prince
saw
at
a
second
glance
that
the
men
had
only
the
appearance
of
being
dead
that
indeed
they
were
really
who
had
fallen
asleep
with
their
beside
them
he
ascended
the
stairway
he
entered
an
antechamber
where
the
guard
ranged
in
line
with
their
muskets
on
their
shoulders
were
snoring
contentedly
he
crossed
a
where
many
lords
and
ladies
were
sleeping
some
standing
and
some
sitting
then
he
found
himself
in
a
magnificent
apartment
where
on
a
couch
whose
curtains
were
lifted
slept
a
young
princess
as
lovely
as
if
she
had
strayed
from
paradise
the
prince
knelt
beside
her
and
pressed
his
lips
on
her
white
hand
that
lay
on
the
coverlet
the
spell
was
broken
the
princess
opened
her
eyes
and
looking
at
the
prince
as
if
he
was
no
stranger
said
is
it
you
my
prince
i
know
you
for
the
fairy
has
sent
me
such
happy
dreams
in
order
that
i
might
know
the
one
who
should
free
me
from
then
they
talked
together
each
had
so
much
to
say
the
prince
forgot
the
flight
of
time
and
the
princess
certainly
did
it
was
so
long
since
she
had
talked
with
any
one
meanwhile
the
whole
castle
had
awakened
when
the
princess
did
and
all
the
people
had
returned
to
their
regular
duties
they
were
naturally
dinner
was
prepared
then
the
maid
of
honour
who
was
as
hungry
as
the
others
and
who
really
had
difficulty
to
keep
her
voice
from
being
as
sharp
as
her
appetite
went
to
the
princess
s
apartment
and
said
in
a
gentle
tone
pardon
your
highness
but
dinner
is
the
princess
was
superbly
dressed
and
the
prince
was
careful
not
to
say
that
her
robe
was
like
that
of
his
he
did
not
find
her
any
the
less
beautiful
for
all
that
they
dined
in
the
hall
of
mirrors
and
were
served
by
the
pages
and
of
the
princess
the
violins
and
hautboys
played
delightfully
considering
that
they
had
lain
untouched
for
a
hundred
years
after
dinner
the
prince
and
princess
were
married
in
the
chapel
of
the
castle
and
on
the
death
of
the
prince
s
father
which
occurred
soon
after
the
marriage
the
prince
and
princess
reigned
happily
over
all
that
land
prince
chéri
long
ago
there
lived
a
monarch
who
was
such
a
very
honest
man
that
his
subjects
entitled
him
the
good
one
day
when
he
was
out
hunting
a
little
white
rabbit
which
had
been
half
killed
by
his
hounds
leaped
right
into
his
majesty
s
arms
said
he
caressing
it
this
poor
creature
has
put
itself
under
my
protection
and
i
will
allow
no
one
to
injure
so
he
carried
it
to
his
palace
had
prepared
for
it
a
neat
little
with
abundance
of
the
daintiest
food
such
as
rabbits
love
and
there
he
left
it
the
same
night
when
he
was
alone
in
his
chamber
there
appeared
to
him
a
beautiful
lady
she
was
dressed
neither
in
gold
nor
silver
nor
brocade
but
her
flowing
robes
were
white
as
snow
and
she
wore
a
garland
of
white
roses
on
her
head
the
good
king
was
greatly
astonished
at
the
sight
for
his
door
was
locked
and
he
wondered
how
so
dazzling
a
lady
could
possibly
enter
but
she
soon
removed
his
doubts
i
am
the
fairy
candide
said
she
with
a
smiling
and
gracious
air
passing
through
the
wood
where
you
were
hunting
i
took
a
desire
to
know
if
you
were
as
good
as
men
say
you
are
i
therefore
changed
myself
into
a
white
rabbit
and
sought
refuge
in
your
arms
you
saved
me
and
now
i
know
that
those
who
are
merciful
to
dumb
beasts
will
be
ten
times
more
so
to
human
beings
you
merit
the
name
your
subjects
give
you
you
are
the
good
king
i
thank
you
for
your
protection
and
shall
be
always
one
of
your
best
friends
you
have
but
to
say
what
you
most
desire
and
i
promise
you
your
wish
shall
be
madam
replied
the
king
if
you
are
a
fairy
you
must
know
without
my
telling
you
the
wish
of
my
heart
i
have
one
son
prince
chéri
whatever
kindly
feeling
you
have
toward
me
extend
it
to
willingly
said
candide
i
will
make
him
the
handsomest
richest
or
most
powerful
prince
in
the
world
choose
whichever
you
desire
for
none
of
the
three
returned
the
father
i
only
wish
him
to
be
good
the
best
prince
in
the
world
of
what
use
would
riches
power
or
beauty
be
to
him
if
he
were
a
bad
man
you
are
right
said
the
fairy
but
i
can
not
make
him
good
he
must
do
that
himself
i
can
only
change
his
external
fortunes
for
his
personal
character
the
utmost
i
can
promise
is
to
give
good
counsel
reprove
him
for
his
faults
and
even
punish
him
if
he
will
not
punish
himself
you
mortals
can
do
the
same
with
your
ah
yes
said
the
king
sighing
still
he
felt
that
the
kindness
of
a
fairy
was
something
gained
for
his
son
and
died
not
long
after
content
and
at
peace
prince
chéri
mourned
deeply
for
he
dearly
loved
his
father
and
would
have
gladly
given
all
his
kingdoms
and
treasures
to
keep
him
in
life
a
little
longer
two
days
after
the
good
king
was
no
more
prince
chéri
was
sleeping
in
his
chamber
when
he
saw
the
same
dazzling
vision
of
the
fairy
candide
i
promised
your
father
said
she
to
be
your
best
friend
and
in
pledge
of
this
take
what
i
now
give
and
she
placed
a
small
gold
ring
upon
his
finger
poor
as
it
looks
it
is
more
precious
than
diamonds
for
whenever
you
do
ill
it
will
prick
your
finger
if
after
that
warning
you
still
continue
in
evil
you
will
lose
my
friendship
and
i
shall
become
your
direst
so
saying
she
disappeared
leaving
chéri
in
such
amazement
that
he
would
have
believed
it
all
a
dream
save
for
the
ring
on
his
finger
he
was
for
a
long
time
so
good
that
the
ring
never
pricked
him
at
all
and
this
made
him
so
cheerful
and
pleasant
in
his
humour
that
everybody
called
him
happy
prince
but
one
unlucky
day
he
was
out
hunting
and
found
no
sport
which
vexed
him
so
much
that
he
showed
his
by
his
looks
and
ways
he
fancied
his
ring
felt
very
tight
and
uncomfortable
but
as
it
did
not
prick
him
he
took
no
heed
of
this
until
reëntering
his
palace
his
little
pet
dog
bibi
jumped
up
upon
him
and
was
sharply
told
to
get
away
the
creature
accustomed
to
nothing
but
caresses
tried
to
attract
his
attention
by
pulling
at
his
garments
when
prince
chéri
turned
and
gave
it
a
severe
kick
at
this
moment
he
felt
in
his
finger
a
prick
like
a
pin
what
nonsense
said
he
to
himself
the
fairy
must
be
making
game
of
me
why
what
great
evil
have
i
done
i
the
master
of
a
great
empire
can
not
i
kick
my
own
dog
a
voice
replied
or
else
prince
chéri
imagined
it
no
sire
the
master
of
a
great
empire
has
a
right
to
do
good
but
not
evil
i
a
fairy
am
as
much
above
you
as
you
are
above
your
dog
i
might
punish
you
kill
you
if
i
chose
but
i
prefer
leaving
you
to
amend
your
ways
you
have
been
guilty
of
three
faults
bad
temper
passion
cruelty
do
better
the
prince
promised
and
kept
his
word
awhile
but
he
had
been
brought
up
by
a
foolish
nurse
who
indulged
him
in
every
way
and
was
always
telling
him
that
he
would
be
a
king
one
day
when
he
might
do
as
he
liked
in
all
things
he
found
out
now
that
even
a
king
can
not
always
do
that
it
vexed
him
and
made
him
angry
his
ring
began
to
prick
him
so
often
that
his
little
finger
was
continually
bleeding
he
disliked
this
as
was
natural
and
soon
began
to
consider
whether
it
would
not
be
easier
to
throw
the
ring
away
altogether
than
to
be
constantly
annoyed
by
it
it
was
such
a
queer
thing
for
a
king
to
have
always
a
spot
of
blood
on
his
finger
at
last
unable
to
put
up
with
it
any
more
he
took
his
ring
off
and
hid
it
where
he
would
never
see
it
and
believed
himself
the
happiest
of
men
for
he
could
now
do
exactly
what
he
liked
he
did
it
and
became
every
day
more
and
more
miserable
one
day
he
saw
a
young
girl
so
beautiful
that
being
always
accustomed
to
have
his
own
way
he
immediately
determined
to
marry
her
he
never
doubted
that
she
would
be
only
too
glad
to
be
made
a
queen
for
she
was
very
poor
but
zelia
that
was
her
name
answered
to
his
great
astonishment
that
she
would
rather
not
marry
him
do
i
displease
you
asked
the
prince
into
whose
mind
it
had
never
entered
that
he
could
displease
anybody
not
at
all
my
prince
said
the
honest
you
are
very
handsome
very
charming
but
you
are
not
like
your
father
the
good
king
i
will
not
be
your
queen
for
you
would
make
me
at
these
words
the
prince
s
love
seemed
all
to
turn
to
hatred
he
gave
orders
to
his
guards
to
convey
zelia
to
a
prison
near
the
palace
and
then
took
counsel
with
his
the
one
of
all
his
ill
companions
who
most
incited
him
to
do
wrong
sir
said
this
man
if
i
were
in
your
majesty
s
place
i
would
never
vex
myself
about
a
poor
silly
girl
feed
her
on
bread
and
water
till
she
comes
to
her
senses
and
if
she
still
refuses
you
let
her
die
in
torment
as
a
warning
to
your
other
subjects
should
they
venture
to
dispute
your
will
you
will
be
disgraced
should
you
suffer
yourself
to
be
conquered
by
a
simple
but
said
prince
chéri
shall
i
not
be
disgraced
if
i
harm
a
creature
so
perfectly
innocent
no
one
is
innocent
who
disputes
your
majesty
s
authority
said
the
courtier
bowing
and
it
is
better
to
commit
an
injustice
than
allow
it
to
be
supposed
you
can
ever
be
contradicted
with
this
touched
chéri
on
his
weak
point
his
good
impulses
faded
he
resolved
once
more
to
ask
zelia
if
she
would
marry
him
and
if
she
again
refused
to
sell
her
as
a
slave
arrived
at
the
cell
in
which
she
was
confined
what
was
his
astonishment
to
find
her
gone
he
knew
not
whom
to
accuse
for
he
had
kept
the
key
in
his
pocket
the
whole
time
at
last
the
suggested
that
the
escape
of
zelia
might
have
been
contrived
by
an
old
man
suliman
by
name
the
prince
s
former
tutor
who
was
the
only
one
who
now
ventured
to
blame
him
for
anything
that
he
did
chéri
sent
immediately
and
ordered
his
old
friend
to
be
brought
to
him
loaded
heavily
with
irons
then
full
of
fury
he
went
and
shut
himself
up
in
his
own
chamber
where
he
went
raging
to
and
fro
till
startled
by
a
noise
like
a
clap
of
thunder
the
fairy
candide
stood
before
him
prince
said
she
in
a
severe
voice
i
promised
your
father
to
give
you
good
counsels
and
to
punish
you
if
you
refused
to
follow
them
my
counsels
were
forgotten
my
punishments
despised
under
the
figure
of
a
man
you
have
been
no
better
than
the
beasts
you
chase
like
a
lion
in
fury
a
wolf
in
gluttony
a
serpent
in
revenge
and
a
bull
in
brutality
take
therefore
in
your
new
form
the
likeness
of
all
these
scarcely
had
prince
chéri
heard
these
words
than
to
his
horror
he
found
himself
transformed
into
what
the
fairy
had
named
he
was
a
creature
with
the
head
of
a
lion
the
horns
of
a
bull
the
feet
of
a
wolf
and
the
tail
of
a
serpent
at
the
same
time
he
felt
himself
transported
to
a
distant
forest
where
standing
on
the
bank
of
a
stream
he
saw
reflected
in
the
water
his
own
frightful
shape
and
heard
a
voice
saying
look
at
thyself
and
know
thy
soul
has
become
a
thousand
times
uglier
even
than
thy
chéri
recognized
the
voice
of
candide
and
in
his
rage
would
have
sprung
upon
her
and
devoured
her
but
he
saw
nothing
and
the
same
voice
said
behind
him
cease
thy
feeble
fury
and
learn
to
conquer
thy
pride
by
being
in
submission
to
thine
own
hearing
no
more
he
soon
quitted
the
stream
hoping
at
least
to
get
rid
of
the
sight
of
himself
but
he
had
scarcely
gone
twenty
paces
when
he
tumbled
into
a
pitfall
that
was
laid
to
catch
bears
the
descending
from
some
trees
hard
by
caught
him
chained
him
and
only
too
delighted
to
get
hold
of
such
a
animal
led
him
along
with
them
to
the
capital
of
his
own
kingdom
there
great
rejoicings
were
taking
place
and
the
asking
what
it
was
all
about
were
told
that
it
was
because
prince
chéri
the
torment
of
his
subjects
had
been
struck
dead
by
a
thunderbolt
just
punishment
of
all
his
crimes
four
courtiers
his
wicked
companions
had
wished
to
divide
his
throne
among
them
but
the
people
had
risen
up
against
them
and
offered
the
crown
to
suliman
the
old
tutor
whom
chéri
had
ordered
to
be
arrested
all
this
the
poor
monster
heard
he
even
saw
suliman
sitting
upon
his
own
throne
and
trying
to
calm
the
populace
by
representing
to
them
that
it
was
not
certain
prince
chéri
was
dead
that
he
might
return
one
day
to
reassume
with
honour
the
crown
which
suliman
only
consented
to
wear
as
a
sort
of
viceroy
i
know
his
heart
said
the
honest
and
faithful
old
man
it
is
tainted
but
not
corrupt
if
alive
he
may
reform
yet
and
be
all
his
father
over
again
to
you
his
people
whom
he
has
caused
to
suffer
so
these
words
touched
the
poor
beast
so
deeply
that
he
ceased
to
beat
himself
against
the
iron
bars
of
the
cage
in
which
the
hunters
carried
him
about
became
gentle
as
a
lamb
and
suffered
himself
to
be
taken
quietly
to
a
menagerie
where
were
kept
all
sorts
of
strange
and
ferocious
animals
a
place
which
he
had
himself
often
visited
as
a
boy
but
never
thought
he
should
be
shut
up
there
himself
however
he
owned
he
had
deserved
it
all
and
began
to
make
amends
by
showing
himself
very
obedient
to
his
keeper
this
man
was
almost
as
great
a
brute
as
the
animals
he
had
charge
of
and
when
he
was
in
he
used
to
beat
them
without
rhyme
or
reason
one
day
while
he
was
sleeping
a
tiger
broke
loose
and
leaped
upon
him
eager
to
devour
him
chéri
at
first
felt
a
thrill
of
pleasure
at
the
thought
of
being
revenged
then
seeing
how
helpless
the
man
was
he
wished
himself
free
that
he
might
defend
him
immediately
the
doors
of
his
cage
opened
the
keeper
waking
up
saw
the
strange
beast
leap
out
and
imagined
of
course
that
he
was
going
to
be
slain
at
once
instead
he
saw
the
tiger
lying
dead
and
the
strange
beast
creeping
up
and
laying
itself
at
his
feet
to
be
caressed
but
as
he
lifted
up
his
hand
to
stroke
it
a
voice
was
heard
saying
good
actions
never
go
and
instead
of
the
frightful
monster
there
crouched
on
the
ground
nothing
but
a
pretty
little
dog
chéri
delighted
to
find
himself
thus
transformed
caressed
the
keeper
in
every
possible
way
till
at
last
the
man
took
him
up
into
his
arms
and
carried
him
to
the
king
to
whom
he
related
this
wonderful
story
from
beginning
to
end
the
queen
wished
to
have
the
charming
little
dog
and
chéri
would
have
been
exceedingly
happy
could
he
have
forgotten
that
he
was
originally
a
man
and
a
king
he
was
lodged
most
elegantly
had
the
richest
of
collars
to
adorn
his
neck
and
heard
himself
praised
continually
but
his
beauty
rather
brought
him
into
trouble
for
the
queen
afraid
lest
he
might
grow
too
large
for
a
pet
took
advice
of
who
ordered
that
he
should
be
fed
entirely
upon
bread
and
that
very
sparingly
so
poor
chéri
was
sometimes
nearly
starved
one
day
when
they
gave
him
his
crust
for
breakfast
a
fancy
seized
him
to
go
and
eat
it
in
the
so
he
took
the
bread
in
his
mouth
and
trotted
away
toward
a
stream
which
he
knew
and
where
he
sometimes
stopped
to
drink
but
instead
of
the
stream
he
saw
a
splendid
palace
glittering
with
gold
and
precious
stones
entering
the
doors
was
a
crowd
of
men
and
women
magnificently
dressed
and
within
there
was
singing
and
dancing
and
good
cheer
of
all
sorts
yet
however
grandly
and
gaily
the
people
went
in
chéri
noticed
that
those
who
came
out
were
pale
thin
ragged
covered
with
wounds
and
sores
some
of
them
dropped
dead
at
once
others
dragged
themselves
on
a
little
way
and
then
lay
down
dying
of
hunger
and
vainly
begged
a
morsel
of
bread
from
others
who
were
entering
in
who
never
took
the
least
notice
of
them
chéri
perceived
one
woman
who
was
trying
feebly
to
gather
and
eat
some
green
herbs
poor
thing
said
he
to
himself
i
know
what
it
is
to
be
hungry
and
i
want
my
breakfast
badly
enough
but
still
it
will
not
kill
me
to
wait
till
and
my
crust
may
save
the
life
of
this
poor
so
the
little
dog
ran
up
to
her
and
dropped
his
bread
at
her
feet
she
picked
it
up
and
ate
it
with
avidity
soon
she
looked
quite
recovered
and
chéri
delighted
was
trotting
back
again
to
his
kennel
when
he
heard
loud
cries
and
saw
a
young
girl
dragged
by
four
men
to
the
door
of
the
palace
which
they
were
trying
to
compel
her
to
enter
oh
how
he
wished
himself
a
monster
again
as
when
he
slew
the
tiger
for
the
young
girl
was
no
other
than
his
beloved
zelia
alas
what
could
a
poor
little
dog
do
to
defend
her
but
he
ran
forward
and
barked
at
the
men
and
bit
their
heels
until
at
last
they
chased
him
away
with
heavy
blows
and
then
he
lay
down
outside
the
determined
to
watch
and
see
what
had
become
of
zelia
conscience
pricked
him
now
what
he
thought
i
am
furious
against
these
wicked
men
who
are
carrying
her
away
and
did
i
not
do
the
same
myself
did
i
not
cast
her
into
prison
and
intend
to
sell
her
as
a
slave
who
knows
how
much
more
wickedness
i
might
not
have
done
to
her
and
others
if
heaven
s
justice
had
not
stopped
me
in
time
while
he
lay
thinking
and
repenting
he
heard
a
window
open
and
saw
zelia
throw
out
of
it
a
bit
of
dainty
meat
chéri
who
felt
hungry
enough
by
this
time
was
just
about
to
eat
it
when
the
woman
to
whom
he
had
given
his
crust
snatched
him
up
in
her
arms
poor
little
beast
cried
she
patting
him
every
bit
of
food
in
that
palace
is
poisoned
you
shall
not
touch
a
and
at
the
same
time
the
voice
in
the
air
repeated
again
good
actions
never
go
and
chéri
found
himself
changed
into
a
beautiful
little
white
pigeon
he
remembered
with
joy
that
white
was
the
colour
of
the
fairy
candide
and
began
to
hope
that
she
was
taking
him
into
favour
again
so
he
stretched
his
wings
delighted
that
he
might
now
have
a
chance
of
approaching
his
fair
zelia
he
flew
up
to
the
palace
windows
and
finding
one
of
them
open
entered
and
sought
everywhere
but
he
could
not
find
zelia
then
in
despair
he
flew
out
again
resolved
to
go
over
the
world
until
he
beheld
her
once
more
he
took
flight
at
once
and
traversed
many
countries
swiftly
as
a
bird
can
but
found
no
trace
of
his
beloved
at
length
in
a
desert
sitting
beside
an
old
hermit
in
his
cave
and
partaking
with
him
of
his
frugal
repast
chéri
saw
a
poor
peasant
girl
and
recognized
zelia
transported
with
joy
he
flew
in
perched
on
her
shoulder
and
expressed
his
delight
and
affection
by
a
thousand
caresses
she
charmed
with
the
pretty
little
pigeon
caressed
it
in
her
turn
and
promised
it
that
if
it
would
stay
with
her
she
would
love
it
always
what
have
you
done
zelia
said
the
hermit
smiling
and
while
he
spoke
the
white
pigeon
vanished
and
there
stood
prince
chéri
in
his
own
natural
form
your
enchantment
ended
prince
when
zelia
promised
to
love
you
indeed
she
has
loved
you
always
but
your
many
faults
constrained
her
to
hide
her
love
these
are
now
amended
and
you
may
both
live
happy
if
you
will
because
your
union
is
founded
upon
mutual
chéri
and
zelia
threw
themselves
at
the
feet
of
the
hermit
whose
form
also
began
to
change
his
soiled
garments
became
of
dazzling
whiteness
and
his
long
beard
and
withered
face
grew
into
the
flowing
hair
and
lovely
countenance
of
fairy
candide
rise
up
my
children
said
she
i
must
now
transport
you
to
your
palace
and
restore
to
prince
chéri
his
father
s
crown
of
which
he
is
now
she
had
scarcely
ceased
speaking
when
they
found
themselves
in
the
chamber
of
suliman
who
delighted
to
find
again
his
beloved
pupil
and
master
willingly
resigned
the
throne
and
became
the
most
faithful
of
his
subjects
king
chéri
and
queen
zelia
reigned
together
for
many
years
and
it
is
said
that
the
former
was
so
blameless
and
strict
in
all
his
duties
that
though
he
constantly
wore
the
ring
which
candide
had
restored
to
him
it
never
once
pricked
his
finger
enough
to
make
it
bleed
le
prince
de
miss
toads
and
diamonds
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
widow
who
had
two
daughters
the
elder
was
so
exactly
like
her
mother
in
disposition
and
in
face
that
whoever
saw
one
saw
the
other
they
were
both
so
disagreeable
and
so
proud
that
nobody
could
endure
them
the
younger
was
the
image
of
her
dead
father
she
was
sweet
and
besides
being
very
beautiful
while
her
mother
loved
the
elder
daughter
to
distraction
she
hated
the
younger
the
poor
child
had
to
eat
in
the
kitchen
and
work
day
and
night
and
twice
every
day
she
had
to
walk
several
miles
to
a
distant
fountain
to
fetch
home
a
large
pitcher
of
water
one
morning
while
she
was
resting
beside
the
fountain
a
poor
woman
passing
by
stopped
and
asked
her
for
a
drink
yes
indeed
said
the
obliging
young
girl
and
immediately
dipping
her
pitcher
she
filled
it
where
the
water
was
coldest
and
held
it
carefully
up
so
that
the
woman
might
easily
drink
from
it
when
the
woman
had
finished
drinking
she
said
you
are
so
beautiful
so
good
and
so
kind
that
i
must
bestow
a
gift
upon
you
for
every
word
that
you
speak
there
shall
fall
from
your
lips
either
a
flower
or
a
now
the
woman
was
not
really
a
poor
peasant
but
a
fairy
who
had
taken
that
form
in
order
to
find
how
the
young
girl
was
she
then
vanished
as
soon
as
the
daughter
arrived
at
home
her
mother
scolded
her
for
being
absent
so
long
i
beg
your
pardon
my
mother
for
being
gone
such
a
long
time
answered
the
girl
and
as
she
spoke
there
fell
from
her
lips
three
roses
three
lilies
three
pearls
and
three
large
diamonds
what
do
i
see
exclaimed
her
mother
in
amazement
where
did
you
get
them
my
child
it
was
the
first
time
in
her
life
that
she
had
ever
called
her
my
i
do
believe
those
jewels
came
from
your
mouth
the
poor
girl
told
her
in
a
few
words
what
had
happened
and
while
she
was
talking
a
shower
of
blossoms
and
gems
fell
to
the
ground
truly
exclaimed
the
mother
i
must
send
my
darling
there
look
called
she
to
the
elder
daughter
see
what
comes
out
of
your
sister
s
mouth
would
you
not
be
glad
to
have
the
same
fairy
gifts
you
have
only
to
go
and
draw
some
water
from
the
fountain
and
when
a
poor
woman
asks
for
a
drink
to
give
it
to
her
very
it
would
certainly
look
fine
for
me
to
carry
a
great
pitcher
to
the
fountain
answered
the
elder
daughter
angrily
i
wish
you
to
go
there
at
once
said
her
mother
so
the
girl
went
but
grumbling
she
took
the
prettiest
silver
pitcher
that
there
was
in
the
house
and
she
was
no
sooner
arrived
at
the
fountain
than
she
saw
stepping
out
of
the
wood
a
magnificent
lady
attired
in
rich
robes
she
approached
the
girl
and
asked
her
for
a
drink
it
was
the
same
fairy
who
had
appeared
to
her
sister
but
who
had
taken
the
form
of
a
princess
in
order
to
find
how
rude
the
girl
would
be
oh
indeed
answered
the
insolent
girl
do
you
think
that
i
am
come
here
on
purpose
to
give
you
a
drink
i
suppose
you
think
that
i
have
brought
a
silver
pitcher
expressly
to
draw
water
for
you
draw
the
water
yourself
my
fine
lady
you
are
rude
replied
the
fairy
without
becoming
in
the
least
angry
since
you
are
so
utterly
disobliging
i
bestow
on
you
a
gift
it
is
this
for
every
word
that
you
speak
there
shall
fall
from
your
mouth
either
a
viper
or
a
then
the
fairy
vanished
when
her
mother
saw
the
girl
returning
she
cried
out
well
my
daughter
well
my
mother
snapped
the
hateful
girl
and
as
she
spoke
there
sprang
from
her
mouth
two
snakes
and
one
toad
what
do
i
see
shrieked
her
mother
your
sister
is
the
cause
of
this
and
she
shall
pay
for
it
and
she
rushed
to
beat
the
poor
child
who
fled
into
the
neighbouring
wood
the
son
of
the
king
was
returning
from
the
chase
and
met
her
as
she
was
running
away
seeing
how
beautiful
she
was
he
asked
her
why
she
was
there
alone
and
why
she
wept
ah
sir
she
said
it
is
because
my
mother
has
driven
me
from
the
king
s
son
seeing
five
or
six
pearls
and
as
many
diamonds
fall
from
her
lips
begged
her
to
explain
how
such
a
marvel
could
be
when
she
told
him
about
the
fairy
s
gift
he
thought
that
such
a
wedding
portion
was
more
than
he
could
expect
with
a
princess
so
he
led
the
girl
to
his
palace
and
married
her
as
for
the
sister
she
made
herself
so
hated
and
so
many
vipers
and
toads
sprang
from
her
mouth
that
at
last
her
mother
drove
her
from
home
and
after
having
been
refused
shelter
by
all
the
neighbours
she
died
in
a
dark
corner
of
the
wood
blanche
and
rose
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
poor
widow
who
had
two
charming
daughters
she
named
the
elder
blanche
and
the
younger
rose
because
they
had
the
most
beautiful
complexions
in
the
world
one
day
while
the
mother
sat
spinning
at
the
door
of
her
cottage
she
saw
a
poor
bent
old
woman
hobbling
by
on
a
crutch
she
pitied
her
and
said
you
are
very
tired
sit
down
a
minute
and
then
she
called
her
daughters
to
fetch
a
chair
they
both
hastened
but
rose
ran
faster
than
her
sister
and
brought
it
will
you
not
have
a
drink
asked
the
mother
kindly
indeed
i
will
replied
the
old
woman
and
it
seems
to
me
that
i
could
eat
a
morsel
too
if
you
will
give
me
something
to
strengthen
i
will
gladly
give
you
all
that
i
have
said
the
mother
but
as
i
am
poor
it
will
not
be
then
she
bade
her
daughters
wait
on
the
old
woman
who
had
seated
herself
at
the
table
she
told
blanche
to
go
and
pick
some
plums
from
the
plum
tree
that
blanche
herself
had
planted
and
of
which
she
was
very
proud
but
instead
of
obeying
her
mother
pleasantly
she
went
away
grumbling
and
thinking
what
a
shame
that
i
have
taken
such
care
of
my
tree
just
for
this
greedy
old
woman
however
she
did
not
dare
refuse
to
fetch
some
plums
and
she
brought
them
with
a
very
bad
grace
and
evidently
much
against
her
will
and
you
rose
said
the
mother
you
have
no
fruit
to
give
this
good
lady
for
your
grapes
are
not
yet
ripe
that
is
true
answered
rose
but
i
hear
my
hen
cackling
she
has
just
laid
an
egg
and
i
will
give
that
with
all
my
heart
and
without
allowing
the
old
woman
time
to
speak
rose
ran
out
to
seek
the
egg
but
when
she
came
back
the
old
woman
had
disappeared
and
in
her
place
stood
the
most
beautiful
lady
a
fairy
good
woman
said
she
to
the
mother
i
am
about
to
reward
your
two
daughters
as
they
deserve
the
elder
shall
become
a
great
queen
and
the
younger
shall
be
a
farmer
s
then
the
lady
waved
a
wand
and
in
a
twinkling
the
little
cottage
was
changed
into
a
pretty
farmhouse
surrounded
by
a
flourishing
farm
this
is
your
wedding
portion
said
she
to
rose
i
know
i
am
giving
to
each
of
you
what
you
like
so
saying
the
fairy
disappeared
leaving
the
mother
and
daughters
speechless
with
surprise
and
joy
they
were
delighted
with
the
spotlessness
of
all
the
furniture
the
chairs
were
of
wood
but
they
were
so
well
polished
that
they
shone
like
mirrors
the
beds
were
covered
with
linen
as
white
as
snow
in
the
stables
there
were
twenty
sheep
as
many
lambs
four
oxen
four
cows
and
in
the
yard
were
chickens
ducks
and
pigeons
there
was
also
a
pretty
garden
full
of
fruits
and
flowers
blanche
saw
without
jealousy
all
that
the
fairy
had
given
her
sister
she
was
taken
up
with
the
thought
of
the
delightful
times
she
should
have
when
she
became
a
queen
just
then
a
party
of
royal
hunters
passed
by
and
while
she
stood
in
the
door
to
look
at
them
she
appeared
so
wonderfully
beautiful
in
the
eyes
of
the
king
that
he
determined
to
marry
her
after
she
became
queen
she
said
to
rose
i
do
not
wish
you
to
be
a
farmer
s
wife
come
with
me
sister
and
i
will
wed
you
to
a
great
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
my
sister
answered
rose
but
i
am
used
to
the
country
and
wish
always
to
remain
during
the
first
months
of
her
marriage
queen
blanche
was
so
occupied
with
fine
clothes
balls
and
the
theatre
that
she
thought
of
nothing
else
but
afterward
she
became
accustomed
to
the
gay
doings
of
the
court
and
nothing
amused
her
on
the
contrary
she
had
many
troubles
at
first
the
courtiers
paid
her
great
deference
but
she
knew
that
when
she
was
not
present
they
said
to
each
other
see
how
this
little
peasant
puts
on
the
airs
of
a
fine
lady
the
king
must
have
very
low
taste
to
choose
such
a
wife
talk
like
this
came
to
the
king
and
he
began
to
think
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
in
marrying
blanche
so
he
ceased
to
love
her
and
neglected
her
sadly
when
the
courtiers
saw
this
they
no
longer
did
her
honour
she
had
not
one
true
friend
to
whom
she
might
confide
her
sorrows
she
always
had
a
doctor
near
her
who
examined
her
food
and
took
away
everything
she
liked
they
put
no
salt
in
her
soups
she
was
forbidden
to
walk
when
she
wished
to
in
a
word
she
was
interfered
with
from
morning
to
night
the
king
took
her
children
from
her
and
gave
them
in
charge
of
governesses
who
brought
them
up
badly
but
the
queen
dared
not
say
a
word
poor
blanche
she
was
dying
of
grief
she
became
so
thin
that
everybody
pitied
her
she
had
not
seen
her
sister
for
several
years
because
she
thought
that
it
would
disgrace
a
queen
to
visit
a
farmer
s
wife
but
now
feeling
herself
so
unhappy
she
asked
the
king
s
permission
to
pass
a
few
days
in
the
country
he
gladly
gave
his
consent
for
he
was
delighted
to
be
rid
of
her
when
she
arrived
in
the
evening
at
the
home
of
rose
a
band
of
shepherds
and
shepherdesses
were
dancing
gaily
on
the
grass
there
was
a
time
sighed
blanche
when
i
amused
myself
like
these
simple
people
then
there
was
no
one
to
prevent
it
while
she
was
thinking
thus
her
sister
ran
to
embrace
her
looking
so
happy
and
plump
that
blanche
could
not
help
weeping
as
she
gazed
at
her
rose
had
married
a
young
farmer
who
loved
her
dearly
and
together
they
managed
the
farm
that
was
the
fairy
s
marriage
portion
rose
had
not
many
servants
but
those
she
had
she
treated
so
kindly
that
they
were
as
devoted
to
her
as
if
they
were
her
children
her
neighbours
too
were
so
fond
of
her
that
they
were
always
trying
to
show
it
she
had
not
much
money
but
she
had
no
need
of
it
for
her
farm
produced
wheat
wine
and
oil
her
flocks
furnished
milk
and
she
made
butter
and
cheese
she
spun
the
wool
of
her
sheep
into
clothing
for
her
household
all
of
whom
enjoyed
the
best
of
health
when
the
day
s
work
was
done
the
whole
family
amused
themselves
with
games
music
and
dancing
alas
cried
queen
blanche
the
fairy
made
me
but
a
sad
gift
when
she
gave
me
a
crown
people
do
not
find
happiness
in
magnificent
palaces
but
in
the
simple
joys
and
labour
of
the
country
as
she
finished
speaking
the
fairy
herself
appeared
before
her
i
did
not
intend
to
reward
you
by
making
you
a
queen
she
said
but
to
punish
you
because
you
gave
your
plums
with
such
bad
grace
in
order
to
be
truly
happy
it
is
necessary
to
possess
like
your
sister
only
those
things
that
are
simple
and
joyful
and
not
to
wish
for
ah
madame
cried
blanche
you
are
sufficiently
avenged
pray
put
an
end
to
my
misery
it
is
ended
replied
the
fairy
even
now
the
king
who
has
ceased
to
love
you
is
sending
his
officers
to
forbid
your
returning
to
the
all
happened
as
the
fairy
had
said
and
blanche
passed
the
rest
of
her
life
with
rose
she
was
happy
and
contented
never
even
thinking
of
the
royal
court
except
when
she
thanked
the
fairy
for
taking
her
from
it
and
bringing
her
back
to
the
pretty
farm
and
to
her
dear
sister
le
prince
de
the
enchanted
watch
there
once
lived
a
gay
young
girl
named
fannie
who
never
knew
what
time
it
was
did
she
care
that
i
can
not
say
and
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
tell
you
how
often
she
kept
her
father
waiting
and
caused
him
to
be
late
for
his
appointments
and
such
a
kind
father
as
he
was
to
fannie
for
she
was
his
only
child
and
he
loved
her
very
much
indeed
he
loved
her
so
much
that
he
overlooked
her
faults
when
he
should
have
reproved
them
whole
she
used
to
keep
the
carriage
waiting
in
front
of
the
door
while
she
prinked
before
her
mirror
and
because
she
was
never
prompt
every
one
called
her
miss
yet
after
keeping
people
waiting
she
would
excuse
herself
in
the
sweetest
manner
possible
and
blame
herself
for
thoughtlessness
one
day
her
old
godmother
wrote
that
she
was
coming
the
next
morning
to
lunch
with
fannie
at
noon
she
was
a
fairy
so
celebrated
for
her
promptness
that
people
called
her
the
fairy
prompt
of
which
name
she
was
very
proud
with
her
was
not
ten
minutes
after
twelve
nor
ten
minutes
before
twelve
but
it
was
twelve
o
so
the
next
morning
at
the
first
stroke
of
twelve
she
set
her
foot
on
the
bottom
step
of
fannie
s
house
and
as
the
last
stroke
died
away
she
entered
the
the
table
was
beautifully
laid
and
all
was
ready
but
fannie
was
not
there
indeed
miss
tardy
had
forgotten
all
about
her
godmother
and
was
calling
on
a
friend
she
was
trying
on
her
friend
s
beautiful
new
clothes
and
having
such
a
fine
time
that
the
godmother
was
utterly
forgotten
as
if
she
had
never
been
in
the
world
but
at
last
hunger
reminded
fannie
of
luncheon
and
she
hurried
home
the
servants
informed
her
that
her
godmother
had
arrived
but
as
fannie
s
shoes
pinched
her
she
rushed
to
her
room
and
put
on
a
pretty
little
pair
of
slippers
then
as
her
street
clothes
were
not
suitable
for
slippers
she
changed
her
dress
for
a
becoming
by
this
time
it
was
two
o
clock
she
found
her
godmother
asleep
in
a
comfortable
chair
such
as
is
not
made
any
more
and
i
think
she
was
snoring
a
little
she
awoke
as
fannie
opened
the
door
hurriedly
my
dear
godmother
said
she
i
am
so
sorry
so
ashamed
i
am
indeed
a
thoughtless
creature
to
keep
you
waiting
this
way
that
is
all
right
said
the
godmother
who
was
very
kind
and
indulgent
to
fannie
i
have
slept
a
little
while
waiting
for
you
that
will
do
me
no
harm
what
time
is
it
oh
please
do
not
ask
me
begged
fannie
you
will
make
me
die
with
shame
and
like
a
playful
child
she
ran
and
stood
in
front
of
the
clock
but
her
fairy
godmother
who
had
good
eyes
saw
that
the
hand
had
passed
two
o
clock
the
dinner
as
you
may
well
imagine
was
overdone
but
the
fairy
who
really
loved
her
goddaughter
took
it
all
as
as
possible
and
made
many
gay
jokes
as
she
tried
to
eat
the
burnt
roasts
and
the
scorched
creams
it
was
soon
four
o
clock
and
fannie
s
father
hurriedly
entered
the
where
she
was
chatting
with
her
godmother
well
fannie
he
cried
are
you
ready
are
you
ready
then
he
started
back
when
he
saw
his
daughter
in
her
pretty
pink
and
blue
stretched
indolently
on
a
sofa
her
feet
to
the
fire
while
she
daintily
sipped
her
coffee
what
exclaimed
her
father
have
you
forgotten
that
you
were
to
be
ready
at
four
o
clock
do
you
not
see
my
godmother
with
me
papa
said
fannie
reproachfully
pardon
me
madame
said
the
father
turning
to
the
fairy
and
bowing
although
his
face
was
red
with
anger
excuse
my
rudeness
but
my
daughter
will
cause
me
to
die
with
grief
and
what
has
the
poor
child
done
asked
the
godmother
judge
for
yourself
said
he
prince
pandolph
has
invited
us
to
his
villa
fannie
is
to
sing
for
his
guests
they
are
all
assembled
and
expecting
her
the
prince
has
sent
his
carriage
which
is
now
waiting
before
the
but
papa
said
fannie
can
not
you
go
without
me
you
know
that
can
not
be
child
said
her
father
sadly
it
is
you
who
are
invited
and
it
is
your
fine
voice
that
the
prince
wishes
for
his
musicale
he
will
now
be
offended
for
ever
since
you
can
not
go
in
this
calm
yourself
my
good
sir
said
the
godmother
seeing
fannie
s
confusion
it
is
because
of
me
that
this
dear
little
one
has
forgotten
you
it
is
for
me
to
repair
this
so
saying
she
passed
her
hand
over
the
unfortunate
and
it
was
instantly
transformed
into
the
most
ravishing
robe
embroidered
with
gold
and
pearls
fannie
who
was
naturally
very
pretty
shone
like
a
star
in
this
brilliant
costume
wait
a
minute
said
the
fairy
to
the
impatient
father
who
was
already
leading
his
daughter
away
let
me
finish
my
and
she
put
around
the
neck
of
her
goddaughter
a
magnificent
golden
chain
at
the
end
of
which
hung
an
exquisite
little
watch
the
size
of
a
locket
and
all
of
chased
gold
studded
with
diamonds
now
little
one
said
she
kissing
the
forehead
of
the
spoilt
child
here
is
something
that
will
aid
your
naughty
memory
with
this
you
will
never
again
forget
an
engagement
be
sure
to
come
home
by
ten
o
oh
yes
indeed
said
fannie
kissing
her
godmother
joyfully
it
is
necessary
to
say
here
that
it
was
the
fairy
prompt
who
invented
watches
in
her
youth
but
hers
were
not
like
those
sold
nowadays
in
the
shops
there
was
a
magic
virtue
in
each
watch
for
when
the
hour
of
an
engagement
arrived
it
made
so
loud
a
ticking
that
the
owner
of
it
had
no
peace
until
he
kept
his
engagement
so
it
happened
that
while
fannie
was
listening
to
the
praises
of
the
prince
and
his
guests
who
were
saying
that
she
had
the
most
delightful
voice
in
the
world
she
heard
a
gentle
sound
but
very
distinct
tic
tic
it
is
ten
o
clock
exclaimed
fannie
joyously
to
her
father
oh
my
dear
good
little
watch
that
my
godmother
gave
me
it
has
told
me
so
we
must
hurry
her
father
who
was
very
much
pleased
because
she
had
charmed
the
prince
and
his
guests
with
her
sweet
voice
said
as
they
drove
away
my
dear
child
i
am
going
to
take
you
to
the
finest
jeweller
in
town
and
buy
for
you
the
bracelet
of
antique
cameos
that
you
have
been
begging
me
for
at
what
time
do
you
wish
to
go
at
ten
o
clock
oh

cried
fannie
her
eyes
sparkling
with
delight
at
nine
o
clock
please
ever
since
i
saw
the
bracelet
i
have
been
dying
to
possess
it
very
good
at
nine
o
clock
then
and
what
shall
we
do
with
the
rest
of
our
morning
at
exactly
ten
i
am
to
go
to
the
dressmaker

to

new
gowns
said
fannie
but

not

just
as

dear
little
nightingale
answered
her
father
affectionately
and
order
all
the
gowns
and
furbelows

wish
for
the
plumage
should
match
the
warbling
and
since
it
suits
you
i
will
meet
you
promptly
at
eleven
for
at
twelve
i
have
an
important
business
at
eleven
o
clock
then
dear
papa
said
fannie
but
do
not
forget
to
return
in
time
this
evening
to
escort
me
to
the
baron
s
ball
don
t
worry
said
her
father
smiling
for
nothing
in
the
world
would
i
make
a
pearl
of
a
daughter
like
you
wait
for
an
escort
the
next
morning
fannie
rose
early
and
dressed
more
rapidly
than
usual
and
was
ready
waiting
for
her
father
at
nine
they
drove
to
the
jeweller
s
how
her
eyes
sparkled
as
her
father
clasped
the
cameo
bracelet
on
her
arm
but
the
jeweller
who
hoped
to
sell
fannie
a
necklace
as
well
took
from
his
showcase
such
beautiful
collars
of
pearls
rubies
amethysts
and
other
gems
and
precious
stones
that
she
forgot
how
the
time
was
flying
tic
tic
tic
thank
you
dear
watch
for
warning
me
said
fannie
gaily
but
the
dressmaker
must
wait
tic
tic
tic
tic
you
insupportable
thing
cried
she
and
taking
the
watch
from
her
neck
she
handed
it
to
her
father
saying
i
beg
you
dear
papa
to
put
this
in
your
pocket
it
is
very
annoying
he
took
the
watch
and
seeing
a
friend
on
the
street
went
to
the
door
to
speak
with
him
toc
toc
toc
the
watch
raised
its
voice
so
that
fannie
should
hear
it
the
people
in
the
shop
all
asked
where
the
noise
came
from
and
her
father
mortified
said
to
his
friend
gave
back
the
watch
to
fannie
and
hurried
her
into
the
carriage
she
was
soon
at
the
dressmaker
s
and
her
passed
as
she
ordered
a
dress
of
pink
brocade
trimmed
with
rich
lace
and
a
robe
of
garnet
velvet
embroidered
with
gold
threads
and
a
cloak
of
silver
cloth
trimmed
with
pearls
she
was
not
yet
through
when
she
glanced
at
the
clock
and
saw
that
it
was
eleven
oh
thought
she
that
horrid
watch
is
going
to
disturb
me
again
but
i
ll
finish
my
ordering
toc
toc
toc
the
dressmaker
turned
her
head
what
s
that
miss
she
exclaimed
with
fright
it
is
nothing
let
us
go
on
said
miss
tardy
toc
toc
toc
louder
than
before
it
is
thieves

is
thieves
cried
the
dressmaker
it
is
nothing
i
tell
you

this
toc
toc
toc
louder
and
louder
and
the
poor
dressmaker
half
dead
with
fright
was
in
such
a
state
that
she
could
show
no
more
clothes
and
fannie
put
on
her
hat
and
coat
and
hurried
away
to
the
restaurant
where
she
found
her
father
walking
nervously
up
and
down
ah
how
thoughtful
of
you
dear
child
to
be
prompt
he
said
as
he
led
her
to
a
table
and
the
delicious
food
soon
made
her
forget
her
annoyance
when
fannie
returned
home
she
was
so
fatigued
that
she
put
on
a
charming
wrapper
and
lay
down
to
rest
then
she
remembered
that
she
had
an
engagement
to
see
a
poor
man
at
two
o
clock
whose
want
she
had
promised
to
relieve
she
took
the
fatal
watch
from
her
neck
and
giving
it
to
the
maid
said
take
this
and
carry
it
to
the
cellar
so
that
i
may
be
rid
of
it
two
o
clock
struck
and
the
poor
old
man
who
had
had
nothing
to
eat
for
three
days
presented
himself
the
maid
told
him
that
miss
fannie
was
sleeping
and
would
not
see
him
with
tears
streaming
down
his
cheeks
he
bowed
humbly
and
was
turning
away
when
everybody
in
the
house
jumped
to
the
ceiling
paf
paf
paf
it
was
like
so
many
shots
from
a
pistol
the
neighbours
commenced
screaming
the
servants
ran
frantically
to
and
fro
fannie
sprang
up
from
her
couch
paf
paf
paf
it
must
be
that
wretched
watch
cried
she
paf
paf
paf
yes
yes
i
am
coming
i
am
coming
and
she
hurried
to
the
cellar
and
picking
up
the
watch
returned
to
her
room
in
silence
then
she
called
the
poor
old
man
fed
him
and
comforted
him
and
sent
him
away
with
a
full
purse
evening
arrived
and
fannie
all
dressed
for
the
baron
s
ball
shone
more
beautifully
than
ever
in
her
magnificent
gown
and
just
as
her
father
was
leading
her
to
the
carriage
a
clumsy
wagon
drove
up
and
an
old
countrywoman
descended
from
it
crying
out
that
she
must
see
her
dear
child
her
fannie
just
once
more
before
she
died
it
was
fannie
s
old
nurse
who
had
come
all
the
way
from
her
village
miles
distant
to
hold
her
dear
child
in
her
arms
when
she
saw
that
fannie
was
ready
to
go
out
she
screamed
loudly
and
would
have
made
herself
ill
if
fannie
had
not
embraced
her
tenderly
and
promised
to
return
before
midnight
on
the
strength
of
this
promise
the
old
woman
grew
calm
and
fannie
and
her
father
went
away
to
the
ball
but
as
the
carriage
drove
through
the
streets
fannie
regretted
her
promise
and
slipping
her
little
hand
under
her
cloak
she
loosened
the
fatal
watch
and
flung
it
into
a
deep
ditch
at
last
at
last
she
said
to
herself
with
a
sigh
of
relief
midnight
sounded
and
found
her
breathlessly
twirling
around
in
the
dance
her
eyes
sparkling
and
her
cheeks
glowing
boom
boom
boom
the
orchestra
stopped
suddenly
the
thunderclaps
for
so
they
seemed
to
be
continued
to
follow
each
other
without
interruption
boom
boom
boom
all
the
city
was
awake
women
cried
out
that
the
end
of
the
world
was
come
the
unfortunate
fannie
knew
in
a
minute
what
it
was
fright
seized
her
and
she
lost
her
head
instead
of
returning
home
quietly
which
would
have
put
an
end
to
the
horrible
racket
she
ran
out
into
the
street
and
wild
with
fright
hastened
with
all
speed
to
the
spot
where
she
had
thrown
the
watch
boom
boom
boom
boom
boom
boom
boom
the
houses
were
lighted
the
amazed
people
thrust
their
heads
out
the
windows
all
that
they
saw
was
a
young
girl
running
through
the
streets
her
neck
and
head
bare
and
her
flying
in
the
wind
boom
boom
boom
boom
boom
boom
boom
every
stroke
was
louder
and
more
fearful
the
firemen
came
hurrying
up
to
see
if
there
was
a
fire
and
one
of
them
held
his
lantern
under
fannie
s
nose
and
cried
out
why
it
is
little
miss
tardy
she
has
doubtless
lost
the
time
and
is
hunting
for
it
ha
ha
meanwhile
fannie
ran
on
and
arrived
breathlessly
at
the
ditch
into
which
she
had
flung
the
watch
guided
by
its
thunderous
blows
she
quickly
laid
her
fingers
on
it
in
a
fury
she
was
about
to
dash
it
against
a
stone
when
she
felt
a
hand
on
her
arm
it
was
her
fairy
godmother
who
in
gentle
tones
of
reproach
said
what
are
you
doing
my
child
you
can
never
succeed
then
she
took
the
watch
from
fannie
which
instantly
became
quiet
and
passed
the
chain
around
the
neck
of
her
goddaughter
who
was
trembling
with
penitence
and
shame
neither
violence
nor
trickery
said
her
godmother
have
any
power
over
my
gift
to
you
all
you
can
do
is
to
take
it
and
obey
and
then
you
will
find
yourself
at
the
same
moment
miss
tardy
felt
herself
being
transported
through
the
air
and
found
herself
once
more
in
her
own
room
holding
the
hand
of
her
old
nurse
who
was
weeping
with
tenderness
and
joy
i
have
no
need
to
tell
you
that
fannie
never
again
attempted
to
disobey
the
protecting
tyrant
that
she
wore
around
her
neck
and
as
the
watch
no
longer
had
to
warn
her
with
its
loud
ticking
she
learned
in
time
to
enjoy
sacrificing
her
whims
to
her
duty

a

fairy
comes
at

her
hair
is
brown
with
silver
spots
upon
her
wings
and
from
the
moon
she
flutters
down
she
has
a
little
silver
wand
and
when
a
good
child
goes
to

she
waves
her
wand
from
right
to
left
and
makes
a
circle
round
its
head
and
then
it
dreams
of
pleasant
things
of
fountains
filled
with

fish
and
trees

bear
delicious
fruit

bow
their

lucy

fairy
and
giant
in
the
days
of
yore
there
lived
a
very
idle
greedy
naughty
boy
such
as
we
never
hear
of
in
these
times
his
name
was
master
the
young
gentleman
hated
lessons
like
mustard
both
of
which
brought
tears
to
his
eyes
and
during
school
hours
he
sat
gazing
at
his
books
pretending
to
be
busy
while
he
considered
where
he
could
get
the
nicest
pies
pastries
ices
and
jellies
he
smacked
his
lips
at
the
very
thought
of
them
whenever
master
spoke
it
was
to
ask
for
a
piece
of
cake
or
an
apple
or
a
bit
of
plum
pudding
indeed
very
frequently
when
he
did
not
get
permission
to
eat
the
goodies
this
naughty
glutton
helped
himself
without
leave
one
afternoon
master
having
played
truant
from
school
was
lolling
on
his
mamma
s
best
sofa
with
his
leather
boots
tucked
up
on
the
satin
cushions
and
nothing
to
do
but
to
suck
a
few
oranges
and
nothing
to
think
of
but
how
much
sugar
to
put
into
them
when
suddenly
an
event
took
place
which
filled
him
with
astonishment
a
sound
of
soft
music
stole
into
the
room
becoming
louder
and
louder
the
longer
he
listened
till
at
length
a
large
hole
burst
open
in
the
wall
of
the
room
then
there
stepped
into
his
presence
two
magnificent
fairies
just
arrived
from
their
castles
in
the
air
to
pay
him
a
visit
they
had
travelled
all
the
way
on
purpose
to
talk
with
master
the
fairy
was
gorgeously
dressed
with
a
wreath
of
flames
round
her
head
a
robe
of
gold
tissue
a
necklace
of
rubies
and
a
bouquet
of
glittering
diamonds
in
her
hand
her
teeth
were
gold
her
hair
was
of
the
most
brilliant
purple
and
her
eyes
were
green
in
fact
she
was
a
most
fine
and
fashionable
fairy
the
fairy
who
followed
next
was
simply
dressed
in
white
muslin
with
bunches
of
natural
flowers
in
her
brown
hair
and
she
carried
a
few
neat
small
books
which
made
master
shudder
the
two
fairies
now
informed
him
that
they
very
often
invited
large
parties
of
children
to
spend
some
time
at
their
palaces
therefore
they
had
now
come
to
invite
master
but
as
they
lived
in
opposite
directions
he
would
have
to
choose
which
he
would
visit
first
in
my
house
said
the
fairy
speaking
with
a
very
sweet
smile
and
a
soft
pleasing
voice
my
young
friends
rise
at
seven
every
morning
and
amuse
themselves
with
working
in
a
beautiful
garden
of
flowers
raising
fruits
of
all
kinds
visiting
the
poor
playing
together
and
learning
to
know
the
world
they
live
in
and
how
to
fulfill
the
purposes
for
which
they
have
been
brought
into
it
in
short
all
our
amusements
tend
to
some
useful
object
and
you
will
grow
wiser
better
and
happier
every
day
you
remain
in
the
palace
of
but
in
the
castle
needless
where
i
live
interrupted
the
fairy
rudely
pushing
her
companion
aside
we
never
think
of
working
no
one
is
ever
asked
a
question
we
lead
the
most
fashionable
life
imaginable
each
of
my
visitors
sits
with
his
back
to
as
many
of
the
company
as
possible
and
whenever
he
can
he
sits
in
the
most
comfortable
chair
if
he
takes
the
trouble
to
wish
for
anything
he
gets
it
clothes
are
provided
of
the
most
magnificent
kinds
which
go
on
by
themselves
without
buttons
or
strings
delicious
dishes
are
served
smoking
hot
under
his
nose
at
all
hours
while
any
rain
that
falls
is
of
lemonade
chocolate
and
cider
and
in
winter
it
generally
snows
and
for
an
hour
during
the
nobody
need
be
told
which
fairy
master
preferred
and
quite
charmed
at
his
good
fortune
in
receiving
such
a
delightful
invitation
he
eagerly
gave
his
hand
to
his
splendid
new
acquaintance
who
promised
him
so
much
pleasure
and
ease
he
gladly
proceeded
with
her
in
a
carriage
lined
with
velvet
stuffed
with
downy
pillows
and
drawn
by
swans
to
that
magnificent
residence
castle
needless
which
was
lighted
by
a
thousand
windows
during
the
day
and
by
a
million
lamps
at
night
here
master
enjoyed
a
constant
holiday
and
a
continual
feast
a
beautiful
lady
covered
with
jewels
was
ready
to
tell
him
stories
from
morning
till
night
servants
waited
to
pick
up
his
playthings
if
they
fell
and
to
draw
out
his
purse
or
pocket
handkerchief
when
he
wished
to
use
them
thus
master
lay
dozing
for
hours
and
days
on
richly
embroidered
cushions
never
stirring
from
his
place
in
the
garden
but
admiring
the
view
of
trees
covered
with
the
richest
burnt
almonds
the
grottoes
of
a
fountain
of
lemonade
and
a
bright
clear
pond
filled
with
goldfish
that
let
themselves
be
caught
nothing
could
be
more
complete
yet
strange
to
say
master
did
not
seem
particularly
happy
every
day
he
became
more
peevish
no
sweetmeats
were
worth
the
trouble
of
eating
no
game
was
pleasant
to
play
and
he
wished
that
it
were
possible
to
sleep
all
day
as
well
as
night
not
a
hundred
miles
from
the
fairy
s
palace
there
lived
a
cruel
monster
called
the
giant
when
he
stood
erect
he
looked
like
the
tall
steeple
of
a
great
church
he
raised
his
head
so
high
that
he
could
peep
over
the
loftiest
mountains
and
he
was
obliged
to
climb
a
ladder
to
comb
his
own
hair
every
morning
this
prodigiously
great
giant
walked
round
the
world
before
breakfast
looking
for
something
to
eat
he
lived
in
fine
style
and
his
dinners
were
most
magnificent
consisting
of
an
elephant
roasted
whole
ostrich
patties
a
tiger
smothered
in
onions
stewed
lions
and
whale
soup
but
for
a
side
dish
his
favourite
of
all
consisted
of
little
boys
as
fat
as
possible
fried
in
crumbs
of
bread
with
plenty
of
pepper
and
salt
no
children
were
so
or
in
such
good
condition
for
eating
as
those
in
the
fairy
s
garden
who
was
a
particular
friend
of
the
giant
she
oftentimes
laughingly
said
that
she
gave
him
permission
to
help
himself
whenever
he
pleased
to
as
many
of
her
visitors
as
he
chose
and
in
return
for
such
civility
the
giant
often
invited
her
to
dinner
one
day
when
master
felt
even
more
lazy
more
idle
more
miserable
than
ever
he
lay
beside
a
perfect
mountain
of
toys
and
cakes
wondering
what
to
wish
for
next
and
hating
the
very
sight
of
everything
and
everybody
at
last
he
gave
so
loud
a
yawn
of
weariness
and
disgust
and
he
sighed
so
deeply
that
the
giant
heard
the
sounds
as
he
passed
along
the
road
before
breakfast
instantly
he
stepped
into
the
garden
to
see
what
was
the
matter
on
observing
a
large
fat
overgrown
boy
as
round
as
a
dumpling
lying
on
a
bed
of
roses
he
gave
a
cry
of
delight
followed
by
a
gigantic
peal
of
laughter
which
was
heard
three
miles
off
picking
up
master
between
his
finger
and
thumb
with
a
pinch
that
nearly
broke
his
ribs
he
carried
him
rapidly
toward
his
own
castle
while
the
fairy
laughingly
shook
her
head
as
he
passed
saying
that
little
man
does
me
great
credit
he
has
been
fed
only
for
a
week
and
is
as
fat
already
as
a
prize
ox
what
a
dainty
morsel
he
will
be
when
do
you
dine
my
friend
in
case
i
should
have
time
to
look
in
upon
you
on
reaching
home
the
giant
immediately
hung
up
master
by
the
hair
of
his
head
on
a
prodigious
hook
in
the
larder
then
he
went
away
to
look
for
more
little
boys
there
in
torture
of
mind
and
body
like
a
fish
on
a
hook
the
wretched
master
began
to
reflect
seriously
on
his
former
ways
and
to
consider
what
a
happy
home
he
might
have
had
if
he
had
been
satisfied
to
go
to
school
and
study
with
the
other
boys
in
the
midst
of
these
sad
reflections
master
s
attention
was
attracted
by
the
sound
of
many
voices
laughing
talking
and
singing
which
caused
him
to
turn
his
eyes
and
look
out
of
the
larder
window
for
the
first
time
he
observed
that
the
fairy
s
garden
lay
upon
a
beautiful
sloping
bank
not
far
away
there
a
crowd
of
merry
noisy
boys
were
busily
employed
and
seemed
happier
than
the
day
was
long
poor
master
watched
them
envying
the
enjoyment
with
which
they
raked
the
gathered
fruit
carried
baskets
of
vegetables
to
the
poor
worked
with
carpenters
tools
drew
pictures
shot
with
bows
and
arrows
and
played
ball
then
they
sat
in
sunny
arbours
learning
their
lessons
till
the
having
been
rung
the
whole
party
sat
down
to
a
feast
of
roast
meat
and
other
good
wholesome
things
the
fairy
presided
and
helped
her
guests
to
as
much
as
was
good
for
them
large
tears
rolled
down
the
cheeks
of
master
while
watching
this
scene
and
remembering
that
if
he
had
known
what
was
best
for
him
he
might
have
been
as
happy
as
the
happiest
of
these
excellent
boys
instead
of
being
about
to
suffer
a
most
miserable
death
now
as
the
giant
wished
a
nice
dish
of
fried
boys
for
dinner
and
as
there
was
plenty
of
time
he
seized
a
large
basket
in
his
hand
and
set
off
at
a
rapid
pace
toward
the
fairy
s
garden
it
was
very
seldom
that
ventured
to
forage
there
as
he
had
never
once
succeeded
in
carrying
off
a
single
captive
from
that
garden
it
was
so
well
fortified
and
so
bravely
defended
but
on
this
occasion
being
desperately
hungry
he
felt
bold
as
a
lion
and
walked
with
outstretched
hands
straight
toward
the
fairy
s
taking
such
huge
strides
that
he
seemed
almost
to
trample
on
himself
a
cry
of
consternation
arose
the
minute
this
tremendous
giant
appeared
and
as
usual
as
when
on
such
occasions
he
had
made
the
same
attempt
before
a
dreadful
battle
took
place
fifty
active
little
boys
flew
upon
the
enemy
with
their
dinner
knives
and
like
a
nest
of
hornets
stung
him
in
every
direction
till
he
roared
with
pain
and
would
have
run
away
but
the
fairy
rushed
forward
and
cut
off
his
head
with
the
if
a
great
mountain
had
fallen
to
the
earth
it
would
have
seemed
like
nothing
in
comparison
with
the
giant
who
crushed
houses
to
powder
under
him
but
the
greatest
event
which
occurred
was
the
death
of
the
fairy
who
had
been
looking
on
at
this
battle
and
who
was
too
lazy
to
run
away
when
the
giant
fell
his
sword
came
with
so
violent
a
stroke
on
her
head
that
she
instantly
expired
the
fairy
seeing
the
enemy
dead
hastened
to
the
giant
s
castle
and
lost
no
time
in
liberating
master
from
his
hook
in
the
larder
from
this
very
hour
master
became
the
most
diligent
active
happy
boy
in
the
fairy
s
garden
and
on
returning
home
a
few
months
afterward
he
astonished
all
his
teachers
at
school
by
his
wisdom
and
studiousness
he
scarcely
ever
stirred
without
a
book
in
his
hand
never
lay
on
a
sofa
again
and
preferred
a
stool
to
a
comfortable
chair
with
a
back
he
detested
holidays
and
never
ate
a
morsel
of
food
till
he
had
worked
very
hard
and
got
an
appetite
when
he
grew
up
he
was
known
as
sir
timothy
bluestocking
and
though
generally
very
and
agreeable
sir
timothy
was
occasionally
to
be
seen
in
a
violent
passion
laying
around
him
with
his
and
beating
little
boys
within
an
inch
of
their
lives
it
invariably
appeared
that
he
had
found
them
to
be
lazy
idle
or
greedy
timothy
tuttle
and
the
little
imps
timothy
tuttle
esquire
was
reclining
on
his
soft
comfortable
sofa
the
flashed
brilliantly
over
the
rich
rug
and
rosewood
furniture
and
fell
softly
on
the
chairs
and
heavy
curtains
it
was
a
mild
evening
in
june
and
the
cool
air
came
refreshingly
in
while
the
bright
light
flashed
gaily
out
the
windows
timothy
tuttle
esquire
one
of
the
richest
merchants
in
the
city
was
reposing
after
the
fatigues
of
the
day
he
was
thinking
how
very
good
and
respectable
he
was
and
of
his
success
in
life
of
his
great
wealth
and
especially
of
his
ships
now
in
the
china
seas
which
were
bringing
him
even
more
wealth
then
he
thought
of
his
plans
for
a
fine
new
mansion
and
how
he
would
now
be
able
to
purchase
many
costly
things
for
his
home
very
soon
he
grew
weary
and
fell
asleep
suddenly
he
awoke
and
heard
something
moving
over
the
rug
and
turning
his
head
to
see
what
it
was
beheld
a
dozen
or
more
of
the
strangest
little
creatures
capering
about
they
were
like
little
imps
in
human
form
but
winged
and
not
higher
than
timothy
s
knee
they
were
from
head
to
foot
and
were
moving
around
with
grace
and
agility
timothy
tuttle
was
a
brave
man
but
he
was
very
much
startled
to
see
this
unexpected
sight
for
as
soon
as
the
little
imps
perceived
that
he
was
awake
they
began
to
bow
to
him
in
quick
succession
more
and
more
rapidly
and
all
the
time
grinning
and
showing
their
white
teeth
from
ear
to
ear
then
timothy
tuttle
heard
something
squeak
close
to
his
head
and
saw
one
of
the
little
creatures
sitting
on
the
arm
of
the
sofa
and
mowing
at
him
don
t
be
afraid
timothy
it
s
only
i
it
squeaked
who
on
earth
are
you
asked
timothy
and
what
do
you
want
this
question
seemed
to
amuse
all
the
little
fellows
hugely
for
they
began
to
bow
again
grinning
and
capering
in
fine
style
and
crying
out
how
do
you
do
timothy
we
are
very
glad
to
see
you
timothy
don
t
be
afraid
timothy
we
re
all
here
i
am
glad
of
that
exclaimed
timothy
i
m
glad
that
there
are
no
more
of
you
plenty
more
plenty
more
timothy
they
cried
laughing
and
holding
their
sides
but
we
ll
do
timothy
we
ll
do
oh
yes
we
ll
do
we
ll
do
timothy
tuttle
was
no
coward
but
he
could
not
help
feeling
somewhat
frightened
as
he
looked
at
their
antics
and
he
gazed
around
to
see
where
they
could
have
come
in
the
door
was
locked
and
only
the
window
was
open
what
do
you
want
go
away
go
away
he
cried
in
a
husky
voice
the
little
imps
grinned
all
the
more
to
see
you
timothy
flattering
reception
timothy
we
ll
be
happy
to
stay
timothy
and
with
that
they
began
to
bow
again
with
great
politeness
timothy
looked
about
for
some
weapon
of
defence
but
saw
nothing
within
reach
what
do
you
want
he
demanded
again
want
you
timothy
must
come
with
us
timothy
where
to
he
demanded
at
that
all
the
little
imps
pointed
over
their
shoulders
with
their
thumbs
to
the
open
window
timothy
reflected
that
as
he
was
in
the
second
story
of
the
house
any
attempt
to
go
out
by
the
window
without
wings
would
be
preposterous
he
drew
his
hand
across
his
eyes
to
make
sure
that
he
was
not
asleep
then
he
looked
again
and
there
were
all
the
little
imps
bowing
more
politely
than
ever
he
seized
a
pillow
and
was
about
to
throw
it
at
them
when
they
flew
at
him
dragged
the
pillow
out
of
his
hands
overpowered
him
and
picking
him
up
by
the
arms
and
legs
flew
out
of
the
window
carrying
him
off
bodily
how
far
he
was
carried
timothy
tuttle
never
knew
but
it
seemed
to
him
a
very
long
distance
when
he
found
himself
again
at
liberty
he
was
lying
on
the
bare
ground
in
the
cold
moonlight
he
sprang
up
and
saw
all
the
little
imps
standing
in
a
circle
around
him
bowing
and
nodding
with
great
he
looked
about
he
found
himself
on
an
open
plain
surrounded
by
forests
nothing
was
in
sight
except
a
very
large
gothic
building
in
the
centre
of
the
plain
it
was
old
but
a
larger
and
more
magnificent
building
timothy
had
never
seen
its
pointed
roof
rose
to
the
skies
and
windows
adorned
its
gray
stone
walls
the
turrets
and
towers
were
beautifully
carved
and
the
walls
were
hung
here
and
there
with
green
ivy
but
the
building
was
falling
into
decay
some
of
the
windows
were
broken
and
some
of
the
stones
crumbling
to
ruin
a
few
of
the
arches
were
fallen
and
the
roof
threatened
to
cave
in
timothy
tuttle
turned
from
surveying
this
building
to
look
at
his
grinning
companions
you
re
wanted
timothy
cried
one
where
he
asked
hoarsely
they
all
pointed
over
their
shoulders
with
their
thumbs
at
the
great
door
of
the
building
but
what
if
i
will
not
go
he
asked
in
as
cool
and
determined
a
voice
as
he
could
assume
at
this
all
the
little
imps
began
to
caper
about
in
great
glee
singing
rash
who
disobey
little
imps
will
bear
away
if
they
still
refuse
to
go
if
they
dare
to
answer
no
take
a
pin
and
stick
it
in
at
that
instant
timothy
tuttle
felt
a
sharp
pain
in
one
of
his
legs
and
he
could
not
help
crying
out
he
knew
that
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
obey
so
he
turned
and
walked
toward
the
building
while
the
quick
patter
of
tiny
feet
and
the
flutter
of
wings
told
him
that
the
little
imps
were
close
behind
only
once
did
he
turn
his
head
and
his
ears
were
greeted
with
oh
yes
timothy
we
re
all
here
when
timothy
had
entered
the
door
he
found
that
the
interior
of
the
building
was
one
great
room
around
its
sides
were
galleries
rising
tier
above
tier
and
under
the
galleries
were
recesses
and
alcoves
still
it
was
all
one
room
from
the
centre
of
the
arched
ceiling
hung
a
splendid
chandelier
with
a
thousand
lamps
but
most
of
the
lights
were
extinguished
and
the
few
that
were
burning
flickered
and
smoked
so
badly
that
the
building
was
dimly
lighted
when
timothy
first
entered
his
ears
were
filled
with
a
hissing
and
fluttering
sound
and
after
he
had
been
there
long
enough
to
become
used
to
the
dim
light
he
saw
that
the
whole
building
was
full
of
just
such
little
imps
as
had
brought
him
hither
they
were
flying
up
and
down
and
flitting
to
and
fro
and
seemed
very
busy
looking
up
he
saw
four
or
five
large
windows
through
which
some
appeared
to
fly
away
while
others
would
dart
through
into
the
building
with
great
swiftness
just
as
bees
come
and
go
from
the
hive
but
the
most
astonishing
part
of
it
all
was
their
extraordinary
politeness
to
timothy
and
the
grinning
that
showed
on
all
sides
as
he
entered
now
as
we
have
said
before
timothy
tuttle
was
no
coward
and
stepping
up
to
one
of
the
little
imps
who
had
just
flown
in
he
said
you
seem
to
know
oh
yes
timothy
replied
the
little
fellow
nodding
violently
yes
i
know
you
i
know
you
well
where
do
you
all
go
to
out
those
windows
and
where
do
you
come
from
oh
i
ve
just
been
to
china
timothy
looked
as
if
he
did
not
believe
him
yes
i
ve
just
been
to
the
china
seas
on
board
your
ships
and
i
have
been
counting
your
and
the
little
wretch
winked
fast
and
knowingly
timothy
was
dumb
he
remembered
what
he
had
been
thinking
when
he
fell
asleep
his
grinning
companion
left
him
and
he
wandered
about
the
great
edifice
where
he
saw
a
large
number
of
little
imps
busily
at
work
some
were
painting
the
wall
with
small
brushes
it
was
amazing
to
see
how
rapidly
they
could
sketch
a
picture
timothy
watched
them
for
a
moment
and
fairly
held
his
breath
when
he
saw
one
by
one
past
scenes
of
his
own
life
start
out
upon
the
wall
many
of
the
scenes
he
had
thought
that
no
one
knew
of
but
himself
but
here
one
or
another
of
his
deeds
good
and
bad
was
drawn
to
the
very
life
upon
the
wall
and
as
they
worked
the
little
fellows
grinned
and
sang
but
timothy
could
not
understand
what
they
said
timothy
turned
away
from
these
grinning
little
creatures
and
moved
to
where
another
group
were
sketching
other
pictures
he
was
almost
afraid
to
look
at
the
pictures
but
when
he
did
so
he
saw
that
the
painters
were
making
designs
too
ugly
and
horrid
to
look
at
but
timothy
was
perplexed
for
of
all
the
pictures
there
was
none
that
he
did
not
think
he
had
seen
before
and
these
little
imps
were
singing
the
same
song
that
the
others
were
singing
and
timothy
thought
that
he
caught
the
refrain
little
sad
little
mad
little
thoughts
here
he
turned
to
look
into
the
recesses
and
alcoves
under
the
galleries
not
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
edifice
were
like
the
little
creatures
who
had
brought
him
hither
oh
no
in
the
shadows
of
the
great
pillars
there
lurked
and
crawled
great
slimy
things
that
made
one
shudder
to
see
enormous
spiders
larger
than
any
timothy
had
ever
dreamed
of
ran
swiftly
across
the
floor
centipedes
and
lizards
clung
to
the
mouldy
walls
and
cold
slippery
serpents
glided
noiselessly
along
occasionally
he
came
upon
huge
shapeless
creatures
who
lay
curled
upon
the
floor
staring
at
him
with
watery
eyes
timothy
hastily
picked
his
way
out
into
the
light
again
here
he
found
other
groups
of
painters
one
group
was
using
brighter
colours
and
blending
them
beautifully
but
he
could
scarcely
believe
his
own
eyes
when
he
saw
the
picture
of
the
fine
mansion
he
was
planning
and
the
images
of
a
thousand
other
things
he
had
wished
and
hoped
for
but
the
painters
in
the
next
group
were
acting
very
strangely
they
touched
their
brushes
to
the
wall
hastily
and
tremblingly
glancing
over
their
shoulders
as
if
in
terror
and
though
their
pictures
did
not
assume
any
definite
form
timothy
felt
most
uneasy
there
he
saw
the
dim
outline
of
another
world
of
which
he
had
heard
but
had
forgotten
to
think
of
for
many
years
meanwhile
timothy
had
reached
the
upper
end
of
the
room
and
found
himself
close
to
a
great
curtain
tightly
drawn
on
either
side
of
it
he
beheld
a
marble
basin
one
of
the
basins
had
evidently
contained
a
fountain
but
it
was
now
half
choked
with
mud
and
only
a
little
water
oozed
out
of
it
on
looking
into
the
other
he
was
astonished
to
find
it
full
of
liquid
fire
just
then
he
heard
behind
the
curtain
the
sound
as
of
a
mighty
rushing
wind
and
at
the
same
moment
the
two
fountains
boiled
up
and
cast
out
their
dirt
and
this
they
continued
to
do
until
each
basin
was
brimming
full
one
of
pure
water
and
the
other
of
pure
fire
the
little
imps
too
heard
the
sound
at
first
they
were
awed
and
hushed
then
they
began
to
fly
about
in
confusion
until
timothy
was
bewildered
by
the
noise
and
movement
suddenly
the
curtain
was
parted
and
timothy
saw
a
stately
lady
seated
upon
a
throne
in
a
noble
arched
recess
her
head
was
thrown
back
her
eyes
flashed
and
in
her
hand
she
held
a
scourge
every
thong
of
which
seemed
to
writhe
and
twist
and
end
in
little
snappers
of
fire
at
the
sight
of
this
scourge
and
the
frown
on
the
lady
s
face
all
the
little
imps
began
to
howl
dismally
the
lady
arose
and
came
down
from
her
throne
into
the
centre
of
the
room
and
the
little
imps
fled
before
her
but
they
could
not
escape
seizing
the
first
one
she
met
she
plunged
him
several
times
into
the
basin
of
water
then
taking
him
out
she
carried
him
kicking
and
quivering
to
the
other
basin
and
plunged
him
into
the
fire
timothy
stood
he
leaned
against
a
pillar
to
support
himself
but
what
was
his
astonishment
to
see
the
lady
take
the
little
fellow
out
of
the
basin
and
release
him
and
he
ran
away
unharmed
but
a
strange
thing
had
happened
the
little
imp
was
no
longer
so
black
and
instead
of
grinning
maliciously
he
was
now
smiling
as
pleasantly
as
possible
the
lady
seized
every
little
imp
in
the
room
in
the
same
manner
and
plunged
him
into
both
basins
then
she
collected
troops
of
the
imps
and
drove
them
before
her
with
the
fiery
scourge
she
made
them
begin
to
scrape
the
dirt
off
the
floor
and
down
from
the
walls
to
repair
the
broken
places
in
the
roof
and
to
polish
the
rusty
and
musty
spots
and
all
the
rubbish
she
made
them
throw
into
the
basin
full
of
pure
fire
sometimes
two
or
three
little
imps
would
carry
one
of
the
great
slimy
reptiles
and
drop
him
in
and
all
those
thus
dropped
into
the
fire
never
came
out
again
and
as
the
little
imps
worked
they
broke
into
a
song
the
rubbish
thither
take
little
whip
will
make
us
ache
tug
tug
the
big
bug
spider
foul
and
slimy
thing
in
the
fire
lightly
fling
rub
off
the
rust
sweep
sweep
away
the
dust
sparkle
sparkle
precious
stone
pearly
roof
and
ivory
throne
dear
dear
dear
hear
the
fiery
lashes
crack
on
each
little
lazy
back
hear
the
glowing
basin
boil
little
imps
must
burn
or
toil
timothy
watched
and
listened
until
he
became
very
weary
then
he
stretched
himself
out
on
the
floor
and
fell
asleep
when
he
awoke
he
found
himself
lying
in
a
dazzling
light
how
long
he
had
been
asleep
he
did
not
know
he
sprang
to
his
feet
with
an
agility
and
ease
that
he
had
never
felt
before
he
looked
about
him
there
was
still
the
same
great
room
the
same
chandelier
with
its
thousand
lamps
the
same
pattering
of
little
feet
and
rustling
of
wings
but
oh
how
changed
how
changed
the
arched
roof
was
composed
of
transparent
pearl
delicately
carved
and
fretted
with
lines
of
brilliant
pendants
hung
from
the
arches
formed
of
great
diamonds
and
pearls
cut
into
exquisite
shapes
the
walls
were
of
ruby
and
topaz
and
sparkled
with
mosaics
of
precious
gems
representing
scenes
more
beautiful
than
any
ever
seen
on
earth
the
huge
pillars
were
of
jasper
and
around
them
was
twined
the
graceful
immortal
amaranth
the
floor
was
of
coloured
marble
inlaid
with
onyx
and
amethyst
in
the
noble
recess
at
the
end
of
the
room
sat
the
lady
on
a
throne
carved
from
ivory
and
studded
with
diamonds
her
scourge
and
frown
had
disappeared
and
from
her
smiling
countenance
shone
a
divine
beauty
the
chandelier
every
lamp
of
which
was
now
pouring
out
a
silver
light
sent
a
glowing
radiance
into
the
farthest
corners
and
recesses
under
the
galleries
and
revealed
no
signs
of
stain
or
shadow
the
basins
threw
high
their
spray
of
sparkling
water
and
pure
fire
looking
like
fountains
of
liquid
light
which
fell
back
again
with
the
softest
music
but
the
greatest
change
of
all
was
in
the
little
imps
they
were
each
and
all
of
a
purer
transparency
of
white
than
anything
timothy
had
ever
conceived
and
there
was
not
one
upon
whose
face
did
not
play
a
smile
of
joy
some
of
them
were
working
harder
than
ever
while
others
were
bathing
in
the
fountains
darting
and
fluttering
in
and
out
of
the
spray
they
looked
as
light
and
brilliant
as
in
the
sun
and
flashing
from
their
wings
were
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
indeed
the
little
imps
shone
so
brightly
that
timothy
could
scarcely
look
at
them
but
while
he
was
examining
all
these
wonderful
changes
with
admiration
he
heard
a
silver
trumpet
ring
through
the
edifice
and
as
its
sweet
notes
died
away
among
the
pearl
arches
the
little
imps
with
myriad
voices
as
sweet
and
clear
as
the
sang
we
rise
in
the
azure
shies
lightly
we
dart
away
lightly
we
roam
through
the
boundless
dome
or
in
pathless
depths
we
stray
bright
little
white
little
light
little
thoughts
we
would
try
how
high
we
can
fly
when
we
would
gaze
on
his
brightest
rays
when
through
glory
we
range
in
colours
strange
lightly
we
turn
to
god
there
hide
there
abide
bright
little
white
little
light
little
thoughts
then
the
most
amazing
thing
of
all
happened
timothy
tuttle
esquire
suddenly
found
himself
lying
once
more
on
the
soft
comfortable
sofa
in
his
own
home
the
was
flashing
over
the
rich
rug
and
rosewood
furniture
just
as
it
had
done
when
he
had
last
seen
the
room
he
raised
himself
on
his
elbow
and
looked
around
but
not
one
of
the
little
imps
was
there
indeed
he
could
find
no
traces
of
them
except
the
marks
of
their
tiny
black
feet
on
the
rug
but
from
that
day
forward
timothy
was
a
changed
man
his
face
was
no
longer
hard
and
selfish
but
it
beamed
with
good
and
kind
thoughts
he
no
longer
preferred
wealth
to
everything
else
in
the
world
he
gave
up
the
plan
for
his
fine
new
mansion
indeed
he
no
longer
wished
for
one
and
he
spent
the
remainder
of
his
days
making
his
family
and
friends
happy
and
relieving
the
poor
and
needy
john
butterfly
s
diamond
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
little
fairy
who
was
remarkable
for
her
impatience
and
laziness
she
was
called
fairy
butterfly
because
she
had
such
splendid
green
wings
with
silver
spots
on
them
she
loved
dearly
to
be
dressed
in
gorgeous
colours
and
to
sleep
in
the
rich
chambers
of
the
foxgloves
or
to
flutter
over
beds
of
fragrant
mignonette
in
truth
she
was
as
luxurious
a
little
fairy
as
the
sun
ever
shone
on
so
much
did
she
like
her
ease
that
she
would
not
gather
a
single
to
bathe
her
face
nor
would
she
pick
a
fresh
for
a
napkin
she
played
all
day
long
or
slept
curled
up
in
the
heart
of
a
flower
oh
she
was
a
lazy
fairy
when
the
queen
of
the
fairies
observed
the
faults
of
butterfly
she
resolved
to
help
her
to
correct
them
one
day
she
summoned
the
lazy
one
to
court
and
said
fairy
butterfly
we
command
you
to
go
at
once
to
the
green
cavern
in
the
island
of
ceylon
and
remain
there
until
you
have
fashioned
a
diamond
more
pure
and
brilliant
than
any
that
has
ever
rested
on
the
brow
of
mortal
or
little
butterfly
bowed
in
silence
and
withdrew
as
soon
as
she
was
outside
the
green
mound
in
which
the
fairy
queen
held
her
court
she
burst
into
a
passionate
flood
of
tears
i
shall
have
to
watch
that
diamond
for
months
and
months
and
years
and
years
sobbed
she
and
every
day
i
must
turn
it
over
with
my
wand
so
that
the
crystals
will
form
evenly
oh
it
is
an
endless
labour
to
make
a
diamond
oh
i
am
a
most
wretched
fairy
so
she
sat
and
sobbed
and
murmured
for
several
minutes
then
she
jumped
up
and
stamped
her
little
feet
on
the
ground
so
furiously
that
the
grasses
trembled
i
won
t
bear
it
she
exclaimed
i
ll
run
away
to
the
fairies
of
the
air
i
am
sure
they
will
be
so
pleased
with
my
beauty
that
they
will
feed
me
and
i
shall
never
need
to
work
again
as
for
the
diamond
why
it
is
just
impossible
for
a
little
fairy
like
me
to
make
it
then
she
peeped
into
a
fountain
to
admire
herself
and
saw
alas
that
the
splendid
green
of
her
wings
had
faded
and
the
silver
spots
were
dim
for
if
fairies
have
naughty
thoughts
their
wings
always
droop
and
their
beauty
fades
at
this
sight
little
butterfly
wept
aloud
with
vexation
and
shame
i
suppose
the
old
tyrant
our
queen
thinks
that
now
i
am
so
ugly
i
ll
hide
myself
in
the
green
cavern
in
the
island
of
ceylon
but
i
ll
let
her
see
that
i
do
not
care
about
her
and
alas
as
butterfly
spoke
thus
the
silver
spots
disappeared
entirely
and
her
wings
became
a
dirty
brown
trembling
with
anger
the
little
one
waved
her
wand
and
called
hummingbird
come
nigh
come
nigh
and
carry
me
off
to
the
far
blue
sky
in
an
instant
a
tiny
hummingbird
shining
like
a
jewel
alighted
at
her
feet
she
sprang
on
his
back
and
away
they
flew
to
the
golden
clouds
in
the
west
where
the
queen
of
the
air
fairies
held
her
court
and
when
the
queen
and
all
her
fairies
saw
butterfly
s
dirty
brown
wings
they
waved
their
wands
and
vanished
and
little
butterfly
was
left
alone
in
the
palace
of
the
air
but
such
a
beautiful
palace
as
it
was
the
clouds
hung
around
it
like
transparent
curtains
of
opal
the
floor
was
paved
with
a
rainbow
thousands
of
gorgeous
birds
fluttered
in
the
sunlight
and
a
multitude
of
voices
filled
the
place
with
sweet
sounds
butterfly
fatigued
by
her
flight
through
the
sky
and
lulled
by
the
voices
lay
down
on
a
rosy
cloud
and
fell
into
a
gentle
slumber
when
she
awoke
she
saw
that
a
tiny
bird
smaller
than
the
hummingbird
was
building
a
nest
beside
her
straw
after
straw
shred
after
shred
the
patient
little
creature
brought
in
her
bill
and
wove
together
and
then
she
flew
away
over
hills
and
fields
to
find
soft
down
with
which
to
line
the
nest
she
is
a
foolish
thing
murmured
butterfly
how
hard
she
works
and
i
don
t
believe
that
she
will
finish
it
after
all
but
soon
the
bird
came
back
with
her
bill
full
of
down
and
lined
the
soft
warm
nest
so
that
it
was
fit
for
a
fairy
to
sleep
in
butterfly
peeped
into
it
and
exclaimed
oh
what
a
pretty
thing
immediately
she
heard
the
tinkling
of
a
lute
and
a
clear
voice
singing
by
bit
the
bird
builds
her
nest
she
started
up
and
the
queen
of
the
air
fairies
stood
before
her
clad
in
a
robe
of
azure
gossamer
embroidered
with
rainbow
lights
foolish
butterfly
said
she
we
allow
no
idlers
here
obey
your
queen
and
go
at
once
to
the
green
cavern
in
the
island
of
ceylon
time
and
patience
will
accomplish
all
things
go
and
make
your
diamond
and
then
you
shall
be
welcome
butterfly
tried
to
tell
her
how
very
hard
it
was
to
make
a
diamond
but
the
queen
of
the
air
fairies
flew
away
touching
her
lute
and
singing
by
bit
the
bird
builds
her
nest
butterfly
leaned
her
head
upon
her
hands
for
a
minute
she
began
to
be
ashamed
of
being
so
lazy
but
she
did
not
yet
wish
to
go
to
the
lonely
green
cavern
and
work
hard
so
she
waved
her
wand
and
called
again
hummingbird
come
nigh
come
nigh
and
carry
me
back
through
the
clear
blue
sky
immediately
the
little
hummingbird
returned
and
she
sprang
on
his
back
he
flew
down
with
her
and
she
alighted
near
the
green
mound
inside
of
which
the
fairy
queen
held
her
court
close
by
the
mound
butterfly
saw
some
bees
working
in
a
crystal
hive
wearily
and
sadly
she
watched
them
they
left
the
hive
dipped
into
flowers
and
carried
their
loads
of
sweet
pollen
back
to
the
hive
and
there
they
built
their
wax
combs
filled
with
golden
honey
i
wish
thought
she
that
i
loved
to
work
as
hard
as
the
bees
do
but
as
for
that
diamond
it
is
useless
to
think
about
it
i
should
never
finish
it
just
then
she
heard
strains
of
delightful
music
coming
from
the
mound
and
a
chorus
of
fairy
voices
singing
by
little
the
bee
builds
its
cell
butterfly
could
have
wept
when
she
heard
those
familiar
voices
for
she
longed
to
be
with
her
fairy
sisters
dancing
i
will
make
the
diamond
murmured
she
i
shall
surely
get
it
done
sometime
and
i
can
fly
home
every
night
and
dance
in
the
fairy
ring
or
sleep
in
the
flowers
immediately
a
joyful
strain
of
music
rose
on
the
air
and
she
heard
her
sisters
voices
singing
the
green
cavern
haste
away
sleep
by
night
and
work
by
day
little
by
little
the
gem
will
grow
till
pure
as
sunshine
it
will
glow
alas
when
butterfly
heard
this
instead
of
flying
at
once
to
the
green
cavern
she
began
to
think
how
hard
she
should
have
to
work
and
how
many
times
she
must
turn
the
diamond
i
never
can
do
it
thought
she
i
will
go
to
the
queen
of
the
ocean
fairies
i
am
sure
she
will
let
me
live
in
her
and
i
need
never
work
again
mournful
notes
came
from
the
mound
as
butterfly
turned
toward
the
seashore
when
she
reached
the
beach
she
waved
her
wand
and
called
nautilus
come
to
me
and
carry
me
through
the
cold
green
sea
immediately
the
delicate
pearly
boat
of
the
nautilus
came
floating
over
the
ocean
and
a
wave
landed
it
at
butterfly
s
feet
she
stepped
in
and
down
down
under
the
waves
she
went
down
to
the
bed
of
the
ocean
to
a
coral
grove
and
there
was
the
magnificent
palace
of
the
queen
of
the
ocean
fairies
its
pink
coral
pillars
were
twisted
into
a
thousand
beautiful
forms
pearls
hung
in
deep
festoons
from
the
arches
the
and
the
were
formed
into
deep
cool
bowers
and
the
hard
sandy
floor
was
covered
with
shells
but
as
it
had
been
in
the
air
so
it
was
in
the
sea
when
the
queen
of
the
ocean
fairies
saw
butterfly
s
dirty
brown
wings
she
and
all
her
court
waved
their
wands
and
disappeared
and
butterfly
was
left
alone
in
the
how
beautiful
it
is
cried
she
giants
must
have
made
these
coral
pillars
as
she
spoke
her
eyes
were
nearly
blinded
by
a
swarm
of
tiny
insects
and
she
saw
them
rest
on
an
unfinished
coral
pillar
while
she
looked
and
wondered
she
heard
a
thousand
being
blown
and
many
voices
singing
by
mite
the
insect
builds
the
coral
bower
the
sounds
drew
nearer
and
nearer
and
a
hundred
fairies
standing
in
beautiful
shells
came
floating
through
the
water
in
the
largest
shell
of
all
was
their
queen
in
a
robe
of
silk
spun
by
the
ocean
silkworm
it
was
as
thin
as
a
spider
s
web
and
the
border
was
gracefully
wrought
with
seed
pearls
foolish
butterfly
said
the
queen
learn
to
be
industrious
we
allow
no
idlers
at
our
court
look
at
the
coral
pillars
of
my
palace
they
were
made
by
these
swarms
of
little
creatures
labour
and
patience
did
it
and
she
waved
her
wand
and
the
hundred
shells
floated
away
while
all
the
fairies
sang
by
mite
the
insect
builds
the
coral
bower
well
said
butterfly
sighing
all
creatures
are
busy
on
the
earth
in
the
air
and
under
the
water
all
things
seem
happy
at
their
work
perhaps
i
can
learn
to
be
so
too
i
will
make
the
diamond
and
it
shall
be
as
pure
and
brilliant
as
a
sunbeam
in
a
so
butterfly
sought
the
green
cavern
in
the
island
of
ceylon
day
by
day
she
worked
as
busily
as
the
coral
insects
she
grew
cheerful
and
happy
her
wings
once
more
became
a
splendid
green
and
the
silver
spots
were
so
bright
that
they
seemed
like
sparks
of
fire
never
had
she
been
so
beautiful
never
so
much
loved
by
the
little
birds
and
flowers
after
seven
years
had
passed
by
butterfly
knelt
at
the
feet
of
her
queen
and
offered
her
diamond
it
gave
light
like
a
star
and
the
whole
fairy
mound
shone
with
its
rays
and
to
this
day
the
fairies
call
it
butterfly
s
maria
little
niebla
have
you
seen
the
white
mist
over
the
river
yi
in
the
morning
a
light
white
mist
that
flies
away
when
the
sun
gets
hot
yes
then
i
will
tell
you
a
story
about
the
white
mist
and
a
little
girl
named
alma
little
alma
lived
close
to
the
river
yi
but
far
far
from
here
beyond
the
trees
and
beyond
the
blue
hills
for
the
yi
is
a
very
long
river
she
lived
with
her
grandmother
and
with
six
uncles
all
big
tall
men
with
long
beards
and
they
always
talked
about
wars
and
cattle
and
a
great
many
other
important
things
that
alma
could
not
understand
there
was
no
one
to
talk
to
alma
and
for
alma
to
talk
to
or
to
play
with
and
when
she
went
out
of
the
house
where
all
the
big
people
were
talking
she
heard
the
cocks
crowing
the
dogs
barking
the
birds
singing
the
sheep
bleating
and
the
trees
rustling
their
leaves
over
her
head
and
she
could
not
understand
one
word
of
all
they
said
at
last
having
no
one
to
play
with
or
talk
to
she
sat
down
and
began
to
cry
now
it
happened
that
near
the
spot
where
she
sat
there
was
an
old
black
woman
wearing
a
red
shawl
who
was
gathering
sticks
for
the
fire
and
she
asked
alma
why
she
cried
because
i
have
no
one
to
talk
to
and
play
with
said
alma
then
the
old
black
woman
drew
a
long
brass
pin
out
of
her
shawl
and
pricked
alma
s
tongue
with
it
for
she
made
alma
hold
it
out
to
be
pricked
now
said
the
old
woman
you
can
go
and
play
and
talk
with
the
dogs
cats
birds
and
trees
for
you
will
understand
all
they
say
and
they
will
understand
all
you
alma
was
very
glad
and
ran
home
as
fast
as
she
could
to
talk
to
the
cat
come
cat
let
us
talk
and
play
together
she
said
oh
no
said
the
cat
i
am
very
busy
watching
a
little
bird
so
you
must
go
away
and
play
with
little
niebla
down
by
the
then
the
cat
ran
away
among
the
weeds
and
left
her
the
dogs
also
refused
to
play
when
she
went
to
them
for
they
had
to
watch
the
house
and
bark
at
strangers
then
they
also
told
her
to
go
and
play
with
little
niebla
down
by
the
river
then
alma
ran
out
and
caught
a
little
duckling
a
soft
little
thing
that
looked
like
a
ball
of
yellow
cotton
and
said
now
little
duck
let
us
talk
and
but
the
duckling
only
struggled
to
get
away
and
screamed
oh
mamma
mamma
come
and
take
me
away
from
alma
then
the
old
duck
came
rushing
up
and
said
alma
let
my
child
alone
and
if
you
want
to
play
go
and
play
with
niebla
down
by
the
river
a
nice
thing
to
catch
my
duckie
in
your
hands
what
next
i
wonder
so
she
let
the
duckling
go
and
at
last
she
said
yes
i
will
go
and
play
with
niebla
down
by
the
she
waited
till
she
saw
the
white
mist
and
then
ran
all
the
way
to
the
yi
and
stood
still
on
the
green
bank
close
by
the
water
with
the
white
mist
all
round
her
by
and
by
she
saw
a
beautiful
little
child
come
flying
toward
her
in
the
white
mist
the
child
came
and
stood
on
the
green
bank
and
looked
at
alma
very
very
pretty
she
was
and
she
wore
a
white
dress
whiter
than
milk
whiter
than
foam
and
all
embroidered
with
purple
flowers
she
had
also
white
silk
stockings
and
scarlet
shoes
bright
as
scarlet
verbenas
her
hair
was
long
and
fluffy
and
shone
like
gold
and
round
her
neck
she
had
a
string
of
big
gold
beads
then
alma
said
oh
beautiful
little
girl
what
is
your
name
to
which
the
little
girl
answered
will
you
talk
to
me
and
play
with
me
said
alma
oh
no
said
niebla
how
can
i
play
with
a
little
girl
dressed
as
you
are
and
with
bare
feet
for
you
know
poor
alma
only
wore
a
little
old
frock
that
came
down
to
her
knees
and
she
had
no
shoes
and
stockings
on
then
little
niebla
rose
up
and
floated
away
away
from
the
bank
and
down
the
river
and
at
last
when
she
was
quite
out
of
sight
in
the
white
mist
alma
began
to
cry
when
it
got
very
hot
she
went
and
sat
down
still
crying
under
the
trees
there
were
two
very
big
willow
trees
growing
near
the
river
by
and
by
the
leaves
rustled
in
the
wind
and
the
trees
began
talking
to
each
other
and
alma
understood
everything
they
said
have
you
got
any
nests
in
your
branches
said
one
tree
yes
one
said
the
other
tree
it
was
made
by
a
little
yellow
bird
and
there
are
five
speckled
eggs
in
then
the
first
tree
said
there
is
little
alma
sitting
in
our
shade
do
you
know
why
she
is
crying
neighbour
the
other
tree
answered
yes
it
is
because
she
has
no
one
to
play
with
little
niebla
by
the
river
refused
to
play
with
her
because
she
is
not
beautifully
then
the
first
tree
said
ah
she
ought
to
go
and
ask
the
fox
for
some
pretty
clothes
to
wear
the
fox
always
keeps
a
great
store
of
pretty
things
in
her
alma
had
listened
to
every
word
of
this
conversation
she
remembered
that
a
fox
lived
on
the
hillside
not
far
off
for
she
had
often
seen
it
sitting
in
the
sunshine
with
its
little
ones
playing
round
it
and
pulling
their
mother
s
tail
in
fun
so
alma
got
up
and
ran
till
she
found
the
hole
and
putting
her
head
down
it
she
cried
out
fox
fox
but
the
fox
seemed
cross
and
only
answered
without
coming
out
go
away
alma
and
talk
to
little
niebla
i
am
busy
getting
dinner
for
my
children
and
have
no
time
to
talk
to
you
then
alma
cried
oh
fox
niebla
will
not
play
with
me
because
i
have
no
pretty
things
to
wear
oh
fox
will
you
give
me
a
nice
dress
and
shoes
and
stockings
and
a
string
of
beads
after
a
little
while
the
fox
came
out
of
its
hole
with
a
big
bundle
done
up
in
a
red
cotton
handkerchief
and
said
here
are
the
things
alma
and
i
hope
they
will
fit
you
but
you
know
alma
you
really
ought
not
to
come
at
this
time
of
day
for
i
am
very
busy
just
now
cooking
the
dinner
an
armadillo
roasted
and
a
couple
of
partridges
stewed
with
rice
and
a
little
omelette
of
turkeys
eggs
i
mean
plovers
eggs
of
course
i
never
touch
turkeys
alma
said
she
was
very
sorry
to
give
so
much
trouble
oh
never
mind
said
the
fox
how
is
your
grandmother
she
is
very
well
thank
you
said
alma
but
she
has
a
bad
i
am
very
sorry
to
hear
it
said
the
fox
tell
her
to
stick
two
fresh
on
her
temples
and
on
no
account
to
go
out
in
the
hot
sun
give
her
my
best
respects
and
now
run
home
alma
and
try
on
the
things
and
when
you
are
passing
this
way
you
can
bring
me
back
the
handkerchief
as
i
always
tie
my
face
up
in
it
when
i
have
the
alma
thanked
the
fox
very
much
and
ran
home
as
fast
as
she
could
and
when
the
bundle
was
opened
she
found
in
it
a
beautiful
white
dress
embroidered
with
purple
flowers
a
pair
of
scarlet
shoes
silk
stockings
and
a
string
of
great
golden
beads
they
all
fitted
her
very
well
and
next
day
when
the
white
mist
was
on
the
yi
she
dressed
herself
in
her
beautiful
clothes
and
went
down
to
the
river
by
and
by
little
niebla
came
flying
along
and
when
she
saw
alma
she
came
and
kissed
her
and
took
her
by
the
hand
all
the
morning
they
played
and
talked
together
gathering
flowers
and
running
races
over
the
green
sward
and
at
last
niebla
bade
her
and
flew
away
for
all
the
white
mist
was
floating
off
down
the
river
but
every
day
after
that
alma
found
her
little
companion
by
the
yi
and
was
very
happy
for
now
she
had
some
one
to
talk
to
and
to
play
with
little
tiny
there
was
once
a
woman
who
wished
very
much
to
have
a
little
child
so
she
went
to
a
fairy
and
said
i
should
so
very
much
like
to
have
a
little
child
can
you
tell
me
where
i
may
find
one
oh
that
is
easily
managed
said
the
fairy
here
is
a
of
a
different
kind
to
those
which
grow
in
the
farmers
fields
and
which
the
chickens
eat
put
it
into
a
and
see
what
will
thank
you
said
the
woman
and
she
gave
the
fairy
twelve
shillings
which
was
the
price
of
the
then
she
went
home
and
planted
it
and
immediately
there
grew
up
a
large
handsome
flower
something
like
a
tulip
in
appearance
but
with
its
leaves
tightly
closed
as
if
it
was
still
a
bud
it
is
a
beautiful
flower
said
the
woman
and
she
kissed
the
red
and
leaves
and
while
she
did
so
the
flower
opened
and
she
could
see
that
it
was
a
real
tulip
within
the
flower
upon
the
green
velvet
stamens
sat
a
very
delicate
and
graceful
little
maiden
she
was
scarcely
half
as
long
as
a
thumb
and
they
gave
her
the
name
of
little
thumb
or
tiny
because
she
was
so
small
a
elegantly
polished
served
her
for
a
cradle
her
bed
was
formed
of
blue
with
a
for
a
counterpane
here
she
slept
at
night
but
during
the
day
she
amused
herself
on
a
table
where
the
woman
had
placed
a
plateful
of
water
round
this
plate
were
wreaths
of
flowers
with
their
stems
in
the
water
and
upon
it
floated
a
large
which
served
tiny
for
a
boat
here
the
little
maiden
sat
and
rowed
herself
from
side
to
side
with
two
oars
made
of
white
it
really
was
a
very
pretty
sight
tiny
could
also
sing
so
softly
and
sweetly
that
nothing
like
her
singing
had
ever
before
been
heard
one
night
while
she
lay
in
her
pretty
bed
a
large
ugly
wet
toad
crept
through
a
broken
pane
of
glass
in
the
window
and
leaped
right
up
on
the
table
where
tiny
lay
sleeping
under
her
quilt
what
a
pretty
little
wife
this
would
make
for
my
son
said
the
toad
and
she
took
up
the
in
which
little
tiny
lay
asleep
and
jumped
through
the
window
with
it
into
the
garden
in
the
swampy
margin
of
a
broad
stream
in
the
garden
lived
the
toad
with
her
son
he
was
uglier
even
than
his
mother
and
when
he
saw
the
pretty
little
maiden
in
her
elegant
bed
he
could
only
cry
croak
don
t
speak
so
loud
or
she
will
wake
said
the
toad
and
then
she
might
run
away
for
she
is
as
light
as
swan
s
down
we
will
place
her
on
one
of
the
leaves
out
in
the
stream
it
will
be
like
an
island
to
her
she
is
so
light
and
small
and
then
she
can
not
escape
and
while
she
is
away
we
will
make
haste
and
prepare
the
under
the
marsh
in
which
you
are
to
live
when
you
are
far
out
in
the
stream
grew
a
number
of
with
broad
green
leaves
which
seemed
to
float
on
the
top
of
the
water
the
largest
of
these
leaves
appeared
farther
off
than
the
rest
and
the
old
toad
swam
out
to
it
with
the
in
which
little
tiny
lay
still
asleep
the
little
creature
woke
very
early
in
the
morning
and
began
to
cry
bitterly
when
she
found
where
she
was
for
she
could
see
nothing
but
water
on
every
side
of
the
large
green
leaf
and
no
way
of
reaching
the
land
meanwhile
the
old
toad
was
very
busy
under
the
marsh
decking
her
room
with
rushes
and
wild
yellow
flowers
to
make
it
look
pretty
for
her
new
then
she
swam
out
with
her
ugly
son
to
the
leaf
on
which
she
had
placed
poor
little
tiny
she
wanted
to
fetch
the
pretty
bed
that
she
might
put
it
in
the
bridal
chamber
to
be
ready
for
her
the
old
toad
bowed
low
to
her
in
the
water
and
said
here
is
my
son
he
will
be
your
husband
and
you
will
live
happily
together
in
the
marsh
by
the
croak
was
all
her
son
could
say
for
himself
so
the
toad
took
up
the
elegant
little
bed
and
swam
away
with
it
leaving
tiny
all
alone
on
the
green
leaf
where
she
sat
and
wept
she
could
not
bear
to
think
of
living
with
the
old
toad
and
having
her
ugly
son
for
a
husband
the
little
fishes
who
swam
about
in
the
water
had
seen
the
toad
and
heard
what
she
said
so
they
lifted
their
heads
above
the
water
to
look
at
the
little
maiden
as
soon
as
they
caught
sight
of
her
they
saw
she
was
very
pretty
and
it
made
them
sorry
to
think
that
she
must
go
and
live
with
the
ugly
toads
no
it
must
never
be
so
they
assembled
together
in
the
water
round
the
green
stalk
which
held
the
leaf
on
which
the
little
maiden
stood
and
gnawed
it
away
at
the
root
with
their
teeth
then
the
leaf
floated
down
the
stream
carrying
tiny
far
away
tiny
sailed
past
many
towns
and
the
little
birds
in
the
bushes
saw
her
and
sang
what
a
lovely
little
creature
so
the
leaf
swam
away
with
her
farther
and
farther
till
it
brought
her
to
other
lands
a
graceful
little
white
butterfly
constantly
fluttered
round
her
and
at
last
alighted
on
the
leaf
tiny
pleased
him
and
she
was
glad
of
it
for
now
the
toad
could
not
possibly
reach
her
and
the
country
through
which
she
sailed
was
beautiful
and
the
sun
shone
upon
the
water
till
it
glittered
like
liquid
gold
she
took
off
her
girdle
and
tied
one
end
of
it
round
the
butterfly
and
the
other
end
of
the
ribbon
she
fastened
to
the
leaf
which
now
glided
on
much
faster
than
ever
taking
little
tiny
with
it
as
she
stood
presently
a
large
cockchafer
flew
by
the
moment
he
caught
sight
of
her
he
seized
her
round
her
delicate
waist
with
his
claws
and
flew
with
her
into
a
tree
the
green
leaf
floated
away
on
the
brook
and
the
butterfly
flew
with
it
for
he
was
fastened
to
it
and
could
not
get
away
oh
how
frightened
little
tiny
felt
when
the
cockchafer
flew
with
her
to
the
tree
but
especially
was
she
sorry
for
the
beautiful
white
butterfly
which
she
had
fastened
to
the
leaf
for
if
he
could
not
free
himself
he
would
die
of
hunger
but
the
cockchafer
did
not
trouble
himself
at
all
about
the
matter
he
seated
himself
by
her
side
on
a
large
green
leaf
gave
her
some
honey
from
the
flowers
to
eat
and
told
her
she
was
very
pretty
though
not
in
the
least
like
a
cockchafer
after
a
time
all
the
cockchafers
who
lived
in
the
tree
came
to
visit
her
they
stared
at
tiny
and
then
the
young
turned
up
their
feelers
and
said
she
has
only
two
legs
how
ugly
that
she
has
no
feelers
said
another
her
waist
is
quite
slim
pooh
she
is
like
a
human
oh
she
is
ugly
said
all
the
although
tiny
was
very
pretty
then
the
cockchafer
who
had
run
away
with
her
believed
all
the
others
when
they
said
she
was
ugly
and
would
have
nothing
more
to
say
to
her
and
told
her
she
might
go
where
she
liked
then
he
flew
down
with
her
from
the
tree
and
placed
her
on
a
daisy
and
she
wept
at
the
thought
that
she
was
so
ugly
that
even
the
cockchafers
would
have
nothing
to
say
to
her
and
all
the
while
she
was
really
the
loveliest
creature
that
one
could
imagine
and
as
tender
and
delicate
as
a
beautiful
during
the
whole
summer
poor
little
tiny
lived
quite
alone
in
the
wide
forest
she
wove
herself
a
bed
with
blades
of
grass
and
hung
it
up
under
a
broad
leaf
to
protect
herself
from
the
rain
she
sucked
the
honey
from
the
flowers
for
food
and
drank
the
dew
from
their
leaves
every
morning
so
passed
away
the
summer
and
the
autumn
and
then
came
the
winter
the
long
cold
winter
all
the
birds
who
had
sung
to
her
so
sweetly
were
flown
away
and
the
trees
and
the
flowers
had
withered
the
large
clover
leaf
under
the
shelter
of
which
she
had
lived
was
now
rolled
together
and
shrivelled
up
nothing
remained
but
a
yellow
withered
stalk
she
felt
dreadfully
cold
for
her
clothes
were
torn
and
she
was
herself
so
frail
and
delicate
that
poor
little
thing
she
was
nearly
frozen
to
death
it
began
to
snow
too
and
the
as
they
fell
upon
her
were
like
a
whole
shovelful
falling
upon
one
of
us
for
we
are
tall
but
she
was
only
an
inch
high
then
she
wrapped
herself
up
in
a
dry
leaf
but
it
cracked
in
the
middle
and
could
not
keep
her
warm
and
she
shivered
with
cold
near
the
wood
in
which
she
had
been
living
lay
a
large
but
the
corn
had
been
cut
a
long
time
nothing
remained
but
the
bare
dry
stubble
standing
up
out
of
the
frozen
ground
it
was
to
her
like
struggling
through
a
large
wood
oh
how
she
shivered
with
the
cold
she
came
at
last
to
the
door
of
a
who
had
a
little
den
under
the
there
dwelt
the
in
warmth
and
comfort
with
a
whole
roomful
of
corn
a
kitchen
and
a
beautiful
poor
little
tiny
stood
before
the
door
just
like
a
little
and
begged
for
a
small
piece
of
for
she
had
been
without
a
morsel
to
eat
for
two
days
you
poor
little
creature
said
the
who
was
really
a
good
old
come
into
my
warm
room
and
dine
with
she
was
very
pleased
with
tiny
so
she
said
you
are
quite
welcome
to
stay
with
me
all
the
winter
if
you
like
but
you
must
keep
my
rooms
clean
and
neat
and
tell
me
stories
for
i
shall
like
to
hear
them
very
and
tiny
did
all
the
asked
her
and
found
herself
very
comfortable
we
shall
have
a
visitor
soon
said
the
one
day
my
neighbour
pays
me
a
visit
once
a
week
he
is
better
off
than
i
am
he
has
large
rooms
and
wears
a
beautiful
black
velvet
coat
if
you
could
only
have
him
for
a
husband
you
would
be
well
provided
for
indeed
but
he
is
blind
so
you
must
tell
him
some
of
your
prettiest
but
tiny
did
not
feel
at
all
interested
about
this
neighbour
for
he
was
a
mole
however
he
came
and
paid
his
visit
dressed
in
his
black
velvet
coat
he
is
very
rich
and
learned
and
his
house
is
twenty
times
larger
than
mine
said
the
he
was
rich
and
learned
no
doubt
but
he
always
spoke
slightingly
of
the
sun
and
the
pretty
flowers
because
he
had
never
seen
them
tiny
was
obliged
to
sing
to
him
fly
away
home
and
many
other
pretty
songs
and
the
mole
fell
in
love
with
her
because
she
had
such
a
sweet
voice
but
he
said
nothing
yet
for
he
was
very
cautious
a
short
time
before
the
mole
had
dug
a
long
passage
under
the
earth
which
led
from
the
dwelling
of
the
to
his
own
and
here
she
had
permission
to
walk
with
tiny
whenever
she
liked
but
he
warned
them
not
to
be
alarmed
at
the
sight
of
a
dead
bird
which
lay
in
the
passage
it
was
a
perfect
bird
with
a
beak
and
feathers
and
could
not
have
been
dead
long
and
was
lying
just
where
the
mole
had
made
his
passage
the
mole
took
a
piece
of
phosphorescent
wood
in
his
mouth
and
it
glittered
like
fire
in
the
dark
then
he
went
before
them
to
light
them
through
the
long
dark
passage
when
they
came
to
the
spot
where
lay
the
dead
bird
the
mole
pushed
his
broad
nose
through
the
ceiling
the
earth
gave
way
so
that
there
was
a
large
hole
and
the
daylight
shone
into
the
passage
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
lay
the
dead
swallow
his
beautiful
wings
pulled
close
to
his
sides
his
feet
and
his
head
drawn
up
under
his
feathers
the
poor
bird
had
evidently
died
of
the
cold
it
made
little
tiny
very
sad
to
see
it
she
did
so
love
the
little
birds
all
the
summer
they
had
sung
and
twittered
for
her
so
beautifully
but
the
mole
pushed
it
aside
with
his
crooked
legs
and
said
he
will
sing
no
more
now
how
miserable
it
must
be
to
be
born
a
little
bird
i
am
thankful
that
none
of
my
children
will
ever
be
birds
for
they
can
do
nothing
but
cry
tweet
tweet
and
always
die
of
hunger
in
the
yes
you
may
well
say
that
you
clever
man
exclaimed
the
what
is
the
use
of
his
twittering
for
when
winter
comes
he
must
either
starve
or
be
frozen
to
death
still
birds
are
very
tiny
said
nothing
but
when
the
others
had
turned
their
backs
on
the
bird
she
stooped
down
and
stroked
aside
the
soft
feathers
which
covered
the
head
and
kissed
the
closed
eyelids
perhaps
this
was
the
one
who
sang
to
me
so
sweetly
in
the
summer
she
said
and
how
much
pleasure
it
gave
me
you
dear
pretty
the
mole
now
stopped
up
the
hole
through
which
the
daylight
shone
and
then
accompanied
tiny
and
the
home
but
during
the
night
tiny
could
not
sleep
so
she
got
out
of
bed
and
wove
a
large
beautiful
carpet
of
hay
then
she
carried
it
to
the
dead
bird
and
spread
it
over
him
with
some
down
from
the
flowers
which
she
had
found
in
the
s
room
the
down
was
as
soft
as
wool
and
she
spread
some
of
it
on
each
side
of
the
bird
so
that
he
might
lie
warmly
in
the
cold
earth
farewell
you
pretty
little
bird
said
she
farewell
thank
you
for
your
delightful
singing
during
the
summer
when
all
the
trees
were
green
and
the
warm
sun
shone
upon
then
she
laid
her
head
on
the
bird
s
breast
but
she
was
alarmed
immediately
for
it
seemed
as
if
something
inside
the
bird
went
it
was
the
bird
s
heart
he
was
not
really
dead
only
benumbed
with
the
cold
and
the
warmth
had
restored
him
to
life
in
autumn
all
the
swallows
fly
away
into
warm
countries
but
if
one
happens
to
linger
the
cold
seizes
it
it
becomes
frozen
and
falls
down
as
if
dead
it
remains
where
it
fell
and
the
cold
snow
covers
it
tiny
trembled
very
much
she
was
quite
frightened
for
the
bird
was
large
a
great
deal
larger
than
herself
she
was
only
an
inch
high
but
she
took
courage
laid
the
wool
more
thickly
over
the
poor
swallow
and
then
took
a
leaf
which
she
had
used
for
her
own
counterpane
and
laid
it
over
the
head
of
the
poor
bird
the
next
morning
she
again
stole
out
to
see
him
he
was
alive
but
very
weak
he
could
only
open
his
eyes
for
a
moment
to
look
at
tiny
who
stood
by
holding
a
piece
of
decayed
wood
in
her
hand
for
she
had
no
other
lantern
thank
you
pretty
little
maiden
said
the
sick
swallow
i
have
been
so
nicely
warmed
that
i
shall
soon
regain
my
strength
and
be
able
to
fly
about
in
the
warm
oh
said
she
it
is
cold
out
of
doors
now
it
snows
and
freezes
stay
in
your
warm
bed
i
will
take
care
of
then
she
brought
the
swallow
some
water
in
a
and
after
he
had
drunk
he
told
her
that
he
had
wounded
one
of
his
wings
in
a
and
could
not
fly
so
fast
as
the
other
birds
who
were
soon
far
away
on
their
journey
to
warm
countries
then
at
last
he
had
fallen
to
the
earth
and
could
remember
no
more
nor
how
he
came
to
be
where
she
had
found
him
the
whole
winter
the
swallow
remained
underground
and
tiny
nursed
him
with
care
and
love
neither
the
mole
nor
the
knew
anything
about
it
for
they
did
not
like
swallows
very
soon
the
came
and
the
sun
warmed
the
earth
then
the
swallow
bade
farewell
to
tiny
and
she
opened
the
hole
in
the
ceiling
which
the
mole
had
made
the
sun
shone
in
upon
them
so
beautifully
that
the
swallow
asked
her
if
she
would
go
with
him
she
could
sit
on
his
back
he
said
and
he
would
fly
away
with
her
into
the
green
woods
but
tiny
knew
it
would
make
the
very
grieved
if
she
left
her
in
that
manner
so
she
said
no
i
can
not
farewell
then
farewell
you
good
pretty
little
maiden
said
the
swallow
and
he
flew
out
into
the
sunshine
tiny
looked
after
him
and
the
tears
rose
in
her
eyes
she
was
very
fond
of
the
poor
swallow
tweet
tweet
sang
the
bird
as
he
flew
out
into
the
green
woods
and
tiny
felt
sad
she
was
not
allowed
to
go
out
into
the
warm
sunshine
the
corn
which
had
been
sown
in
the
field
over
the
house
of
the
had
grown
up
high
into
the
air
and
formed
a
thick
wood
to
tiny
who
was
only
an
inch
high
you
are
going
to
be
married
tiny
said
the
my
neighbour
has
asked
for
you
what
good
fortune
for
a
poor
child
like
you
now
we
will
prepare
your
wedding
clothes
they
must
be
both
woollen
and
linen
nothing
must
be
wanting
when
you
are
the
mole
s
tiny
had
to
turn
the
spindle
and
the
hired
four
spiders
who
were
to
weave
day
and
night
every
evening
the
mole
visited
her
and
was
continually
speaking
of
the
time
when
the
summer
would
be
over
then
he
would
keep
his
with
tiny
but
now
the
heat
of
the
sun
was
so
great
that
it
burned
the
earth
and
made
it
quite
hard
like
a
stone
as
soon
as
the
summer
was
over
the
wedding
should
take
place
but
tiny
was
not
at
all
pleased
for
she
did
not
like
the
tiresome
mole
every
morning
when
the
sun
rose
and
every
evening
when
it
went
down
she
would
creep
out
at
the
door
and
as
the
wind
blew
aside
the
ears
of
corn
so
that
she
could
see
the
blue
sky
she
thought
how
beautiful
and
bright
it
seemed
out
there
and
wished
so
much
to
see
her
dear
swallow
again
but
he
never
returned
for
by
this
time
he
had
flown
far
away
into
the
lovely
green
forest
when
autumn
arrived
tiny
had
her
outfit
quite
ready
and
the
said
to
her
in
four
weeks
the
wedding
must
take
then
tiny
wept
and
said
she
would
not
marry
the
disagreeable
mole
nonsense
replied
the
now
don
t
be
obstinate
or
i
shall
bite
you
with
my
white
teeth
he
is
a
very
handsome
mole
the
queen
herself
does
not
wear
more
beautiful
velvets
and
furs
his
kitchen
and
cellars
are
quite
full
you
ought
to
be
very
thankful
for
such
good
so
the
was
fixed
on
which
the
mole
was
to
fetch
tiny
away
to
live
with
him
deep
under
the
earth
and
never
again
to
see
the
warm
sun
because
did
not
like
it
the
poor
child
was
most
unhappy
at
the
thought
of
saying
farewell
to
the
beautiful
sun
and
as
the
had
given
her
permission
to
stand
at
the
door
she
went
to
look
at
it
once
more
farewell
bright
sun
she
cried
stretching
out
her
arm
toward
it
and
then
she
walked
a
short
distance
from
the
house
for
the
corn
had
been
cut
and
only
the
dry
stubble
remained
in
the
fields
farewell
farewell
she
repeated
twining
her
arm
round
a
little
red
flower
that
grew
just
by
her
side
greet
the
little
swallow
from
me
if
you
should
see
him
tweet
tweet
sounded
over
her
head
suddenly
she
looked
up
and
there
was
the
swallow
himself
flying
close
by
as
soon
as
he
spied
tiny
he
was
delighted
and
then
she
told
him
how
unwilling
she
felt
to
marry
the
ugly
mole
and
to
live
always
beneath
the
earth
and
never
to
see
the
bright
sun
any
more
and
as
she
told
him
she
wept
cold
winter
is
coming
said
the
swallow
and
i
am
going
to
fly
away
into
warmer
countries
will
you
go
with
me
you
can
sit
on
my
back
and
fasten
yourself
on
with
your
sash
then
we
can
fly
away
from
the
ugly
mole
and
his
gloomy
rooms
far
away
over
the
mountains
into
warmer
countries
where
the
sun
shines
more
brightly
than
here
where
it
is
always
summer
and
the
flowers
bloom
in
greater
beauty
fly
now
with
me
dear
little
tiny
you
saved
my
life
when
i
lay
frozen
in
that
dark
dreary
yes
i
will
go
with
you
said
tiny
and
she
seated
herself
on
the
bird
s
back
with
her
feet
on
his
outstretched
wings
and
tied
her
girdle
to
one
of
his
strongest
feathers
then
the
swallow
rose
in
the
air
and
flew
over
forest
and
over
sea
high
above
the
highest
mountains
covered
with
eternal
snow
tiny
would
have
been
frozen
in
the
cold
air
but
she
crept
under
the
bird
s
warm
feathers
keeping
her
little
head
uncovered
so
that
she
might
admire
the
beautiful
lands
over
which
they
passed
at
length
they
reached
the
warm
countries
where
the
sun
shines
brightly
and
the
sky
seems
so
much
higher
above
the
earth
here
on
the
hedges
and
by
the
wayside
grew
purple
green
and
white
grapes
lemons
and
oranges
hung
from
trees
in
the
woods
and
the
air
was
fragrant
with
myrtles
and
orange
blossoms
beautiful
children
ran
along
the
country
lanes
playing
with
large
gay
butterflies
and
as
the
swallow
flew
farther
and
farther
every
place
appeared
still
more
lovely
at
last
they
came
to
a
blue
lake
and
by
the
side
of
it
shaded
by
trees
of
the
deepest
green
stood
a
palace
of
dazzling
white
marble
built
in
the
olden
times
vines
clustered
round
its
lofty
pillars
and
at
the
top
were
many
swallows
nests
and
one
of
these
was
the
home
of
the
swallow
who
carried
tiny
this
is
my
house
said
the
swallow
but
it
would
not
do
for
you
to
live
there
you
would
not
be
comfortable
you
must
choose
for
yourself
one
of
those
lovely
flowers
and
i
will
put
you
down
upon
it
and
then
you
shall
have
everything
that
you
can
wish
to
make
you
that
will
be
delightful
she
said
and
clapped
her
little
hands
for
joy
a
large
marble
pillar
lay
on
the
ground
which
in
falling
had
been
broken
into
three
pieces
between
these
pieces
grew
the
most
beautiful
large
white
flowers
so
the
swallow
flew
down
with
tiny
and
placed
her
on
one
of
the
broad
leaves
but
how
surprised
she
was
to
see
in
the
middle
of
the
flowers
a
tiny
little
man
as
white
and
transparent
as
if
he
had
been
made
of
crystal
he
had
a
gold
crown
on
his
head
and
delicate
wings
at
his
shoulders
and
was
not
much
larger
than
tiny
herself
he
was
the
fairy
of
the
flower
for
a
tiny
man
and
a
tiny
woman
dwell
in
every
flower
and
this
was
the
king
of
them
all
oh
how
beautiful
he
is
whispered
tiny
to
the
swallow
the
little
king
was
at
first
quite
frightened
at
the
bird
who
was
like
a
giant
compared
to
such
a
delicate
little
creature
as
himself
but
when
he
saw
tiny
he
was
delighted
and
thought
her
the
prettiest
little
maiden
he
had
ever
seen
he
took
the
gold
crown
from
his
head
and
placed
it
on
hers
and
asked
her
name
and
if
she
would
be
his
wife
and
queen
over
all
the
flowers
this
certainly
was
a
very
different
sort
of
husband
to
the
son
of
the
toad
or
the
mole
with
his
black
velvet
and
fur
so
she
said
yes
to
the
handsome
king
then
all
the
flowers
opened
and
out
of
each
came
a
little
lady
or
a
tiny
lord
all
so
pretty
it
was
quite
a
pleasure
to
look
at
them
each
of
them
brought
tiny
a
present
but
the
best
gift
was
a
pair
of
beautiful
wings
which
had
belonged
to
a
large
white
fly
and
they
fastened
them
to
tiny
s
shoulders
so
that
she
might
fly
from
flower
to
flower
then
there
was
much
rejoicing
and
the
little
swallow
who
sat
above
them
in
his
nest
was
asked
to
sing
a
wedding
song
which
he
did
as
well
as
he
could
but
in
his
heart
he
felt
sad
for
he
was
very
fond
of
tiny
and
would
have
liked
never
to
part
from
her
again
you
must
not
be
called
tiny
any
more
said
the
fairy
of
the
flowers
to
her
it
is
an
ugly
name
and
you
are
so
very
pretty
we
will
call
you
farewell
farewell
said
the
swallow
with
a
heavy
heart
as
he
left
the
warm
countries
to
fly
back
into
denmark
there
he
had
a
nest
over
the
window
of
a
house
in
which
dwelt
the
writer
of
fairy
tales
the
swallow
sang
tweet
tweet
and
from
his
song
came
this
whole
story
christian
the
immortal
fountain
in
ancient
times
two
little
princesses
lived
in
scotland
one
of
whom
was
extremely
beautiful
and
the
other
dwarfish
and
deformed
one
was
named
rose
and
the
other
marion
the
sisters
did
not
live
happily
together
marion
hated
rose
because
the
latter
was
handsome
and
everybody
praised
her
so
marion
scowled
and
her
face
grew
absolutely
black
when
anybody
asked
her
how
her
pretty
little
sister
was
and
once
she
was
so
wicked
and
jealous
that
she
cut
off
all
rose
s
glossy
golden
hair
and
threw
it
in
the
fire
poor
rose
cried
bitterly
about
it
but
she
did
not
scold
or
strike
her
sister
for
she
was
an
amiable
and
gentle
little
being
no
wonder
then
that
all
the
family
and
all
the
neighbours
disliked
marion
and
no
wonder
that
her
face
grew
uglier
and
uglier
every
day
but
the
neighbours
used
to
say
that
rose
had
been
blessed
by
the
fairies
to
whom
she
owed
her
extraordinary
beauty
and
goodness
not
far
from
the
castle
where
the
princesses
resided
was
a
deep
grotto
said
to
lead
to
the
palace
of
beauty
where
the
queen
of
the
fairies
held
her
court
some
said
that
rose
had
fallen
asleep
there
one
day
when
she
was
tired
of
chasing
a
butterfly
and
that
the
queen
had
dipped
her
in
an
immortal
fountain
from
which
she
had
risen
with
the
beauty
of
an
angel
marion
often
asked
rose
about
this
story
but
the
child
always
replied
that
she
was
forbidden
to
speak
of
it
when
rose
saw
any
uncommon
bird
or
butterfly
she
would
exclaim
oh
how
much
that
looks
like
fairyland
but
when
asked
what
she
knew
about
fairyland
she
blushed
and
would
not
answer
marion
thought
a
great
deal
about
this
why
can
i
not
go
to
the
palace
of
beauty
thought
she
and
why
may
i
not
bathe
in
the
immortal
fountain
one
summer
s
noon
when
all
was
still
save
the
faint
twitterings
of
birds
and
the
lazy
hum
of
bees
marion
entered
the
deep
grotto
she
sat
down
on
a
bank
of
moss
the
air
around
her
was
as
fragrant
as
if
it
came
from
a
bed
of
violets
and
with
the
sound
of
music
in
her
ears
she
fell
into
a
gentle
slumber
when
she
awoke
it
was
evening
and
she
found
herself
in
a
small
hall
where
opal
pillars
supported
a
rainbow
roof
the
bright
reflection
of
which
rested
on
crystal
walls
and
on
a
golden
floor
inlaid
with
pearls
all
around
between
the
opal
pillars
stood
the
tiniest
vases
of
pure
alabaster
in
which
grew
a
multitude
of
brilliant
and
fragrant
flowers
some
of
which
twining
around
the
pillars
were
lost
in
the
floating
rainbow
above
this
scene
of
beauty
was
lighted
by
millions
of
fireflies
glittering
in
the
air
like
wandering
stars
while
marion
was
gazing
in
amazement
at
all
this
a
little
lady
of
rare
loveliness
stood
before
her
her
robe
was
of
green
and
gold
her
flowing
gossamer
mantle
was
caught
upon
one
shoulder
with
a
pearl
and
in
her
hair
was
a
solitary
star
composed
of
five
diamonds
each
no
bigger
than
a
pin
point
she
smiled
at
marion
and
sang
fairy
queen
hath
rarely
seen
creature
of
earthly
mould
within
her
door
on
pearly
floor
inlaid
with
shining
gold
mortal
all
thou
seest
is
fair
quick
thy
purposes
declare
as
she
concluded
the
song
was
taken
up
and
thrice
repeated
by
a
multitude
of
soft
voices
in
the
distance
it
seemed
as
if
birds
and
insects
joined
in
the
chorus
and
ever
and
anon
between
the
pauses
the
sound
of
a
cascade
was
heard
whose
waters
fell
in
music
all
these
delightful
sounds
died
away
and
the
queen
of
the
fairies
stood
patiently
awaiting
marion
s
answer
curtsying
low
and
with
a
trembling
voice
the
little
maiden
said
will
it
please
your
majesty
to
make
me
as
handsome
as
my
sister
rose
the
queen
smiled
again
i
will
grant
your
request
said
she
if
you
will
promise
to
fulfil
all
the
conditions
i
marion
eagerly
promised
that
she
would
the
immortal
fountain
continued
the
queen
is
on
the
top
of
a
high
steep
hill
at
four
different
places
fairies
are
stationed
around
it
who
guard
it
with
their
wands
none
can
pass
except
those
who
obey
my
orders
go
home
now
for
one
week
speak
no
ungentle
word
to
your
sister
at
the
end
of
that
time
come
again
to
the
marion
went
home
light
of
heart
rose
was
in
the
garden
watering
flowers
and
the
first
thing
marion
observed
was
that
her
sister
s
sunny
hair
had
grown
as
long
and
beautiful
as
before
it
was
cut
off
the
sight
made
her
angry
and
she
was
just
about
to
snatch
the
from
rose
s
hand
with
cross
words
when
she
remembered
the
fairy
and
passed
into
the
castle
in
silence
the
end
of
the
week
arrived
and
marion
had
faithfully
kept
her
promise
again
she
entered
the
grotto
the
queen
was
feasting
when
marion
reached
the
hall
with
opal
pillars
the
bees
had
brought
as
a
gift
golden
honey
and
placed
it
on
small
shells
which
adorned
a
crystal
table
bright
butterflies
floated
about
the
head
of
the
queen
and
fanned
her
with
their
wings
fireflies
flew
near
to
give
her
light
and
a
large
diamond
beetle
formed
her
footstool
after
she
had
supped
a
on
a
violet
petal
was
brought
her
to
bathe
her
royal
fingers
behind
the
queen
s
chair
hovered
numerous
bright
fairies
but
when
marion
entered
the
diamond
sparkles
on
their
wings
faded
as
they
always
do
in
the
presence
of
anything
bad
and
in
a
second
all
the
queen
s
attendants
vanished
singing
as
they
went
fairy
queen
hath
rarely
seen
creature
of
mortal
mould
within
her
door
on
pearly
floor
inlaid
with
shining
gold
mortal
have
you
fulfilled
your
promise
asked
the
queen
i
have
replied
the
maiden
then
follow
marion
did
as
she
was
directed
and
away
they
hastened
over
beds
of
violets
and
mignonette
birds
sang
butterflies
fluttered
and
the
voices
of
many
fountains
came
on
the
breeze
presently
they
reached
the
hill
on
the
top
of
which
was
the
immortal
fountain
the
foot
of
the
hill
was
surrounded
by
a
band
of
fairies
clothed
in
green
gossamer
and
with
their
ivory
wands
crossed
to
bar
the
ascent
the
queen
waved
her
wand
over
them
and
immediately
they
stretched
their
transparent
wings
and
flew
away
the
hill
was
steep
and
far
far
up
climbed
the
queen
and
marion
the
air
became
more
and
more
fragrant
and
more
and
more
distinctly
they
heard
the
sound
of
waters
falling
in
music
at
length
they
were
stopped
by
another
band
of
fairies
clothed
in
blue
gossamer
with
silver
wands
crossed
here
said
the
queen
our
journey
must
end
you
can
go
no
farther
until
you
have
fulfilled
the
orders
i
shall
give
you
go
home
now
for
one
month
do
by
your
sister
as
you
would
wish
her
to
do
by
you
if
you
were
rose
and
she
marion
promised
and
departed
she
found
the
task
harder
than
the
first
had
been
when
rose
asked
her
for
playthings
she
found
it
hard
to
give
them
gently
and
affectionately
when
rose
talked
to
her
she
wanted
to
go
away
in
silence
and
when
a
pocket
mirror
was
found
in
her
sister
s
room
broken
into
a
thousand
pieces
she
felt
sorely
tempted
to
conceal
that
she
had
done
the
mischief
but
she
was
so
anxious
to
be
made
beautiful
that
she
did
as
she
wished
to
be
done
all
the
household
remarked
how
marion
had
changed
i
love
her
dearly
said
rose
she
is
so
good
and
so
do
i
said
a
dozen
voices
marion
blushed
deeply
and
her
eyes
sparkled
with
pleasure
how
pleasant
it
is
to
be
loved
thought
she
at
the
end
of
the
month
she
went
to
the
grotto
again
again
the
fairy
queen
conducted
her
up
the
hill
and
this
time
the
fairies
in
blue
lowered
their
silver
wands
and
flew
away
the
two
travelled
on
higher
and
higher
the
path
grew
steeper
and
steeper
but
the
fragrant
air
became
more
delicious
and
more
distinctly
was
heard
the
sound
of
waters
falling
in
music
at
length
their
course
was
stayed
by
a
troop
of
fairies
clothed
in
rainbow
robes
and
holding
silver
wands
tipped
with
gold
in
face
and
form
they
were
far
more
beautiful
than
anything
marion
had
yet
seen
here
we
must
pause
said
the
queen
this
boundary
you
can
not
yet
why
not
asked
the
impatient
marion
because
those
who
pass
the
rainbow
fairies
must
be
very
pure
replied
the
queen
am
i
not
very
pure
asked
the
maiden
all
the
people
in
the
castle
tell
me
how
good
i
have
mortal
eyes
see
only
the
outside
answered
the
queen
but
those
who
pass
the
rainbow
fairies
must
be
pure
in
thought
as
well
as
action
go
home
now
for
three
months
never
indulge
in
a
wicked
or
envious
thought
you
shall
then
have
a
glimpse
of
the
immortal
marion
returned
home
at
the
end
of
three
months
she
again
visited
the
hall
with
opal
pillars
the
queen
did
not
smile
when
she
saw
her
but
in
silence
led
the
way
up
the
hill
toward
the
immortal
fountain
the
green
fairies
and
the
blue
fairies
flew
away
as
they
approached
but
the
rainbow
fairies
bowed
low
to
the
queen
and
kept
their
wands
firmly
crossed
marion
saw
that
the
silver
specks
on
the
fairies
wings
began
to
grow
dim
and
she
burst
into
tears
i
knew
said
the
queen
that
you
could
not
pass
this
boundary
envy
has
been
in
your
heart
but
be
not
discouraged
for
years
you
have
been
indulging
in
wrong
feelings
and
you
must
not
wonder
if
it
takes
many
months
to
drive
them
out
go
home
and
try
once
so
poor
marion
went
sadly
away
and
when
she
visited
the
hall
again
the
queen
smiled
and
touched
her
playfully
with
her
wand
she
then
led
her
up
the
hill
to
the
immortal
fountain
the
silver
specks
on
the
wings
of
the
rainbow
fairies
shone
bright
as
marion
approached
and
the
fairies
lowered
their
wings
and
flew
away
and
now
every
footstep
was
on
flowers
that
yielded
beneath
the
feet
like
a
pathway
of
clouds
the
delicious
fragrance
could
almost
be
felt
and
loud
and
clear
and
sweet
came
the
sound
of
waters
falling
in
music
and
now
marion
could
see
a
cascade
leaping
and
sparkling
over
crystal
rocks
above
it
rested
a
rainbow
the
spray
fell
in
pearls
forming
delicate
foliage
around
the
margin
of
the
fountain
and
deep
and
silent
below
the
foam
of
the
cascade
was
the
immortal
fountain
of
beauty
its
waves
flowed
over
a
golden
bed
and
many
fairies
were
bathing
in
its
waves
the
diamonds
in
their
hair
gleaming
like
sunbeams
on
the
water
oh
let
me
bathe
in
the
fountain
cried
marion
clapping
her
hands
in
delight
not
yet
said
the
queen
behold
the
purple
fairies
with
golden
wands
that
guard
its
marion
looked
and
saw
beings
lovelier
than
any
her
eye
had
ever
rested
on
you
can
not
pass
them
yet
said
the
queen
go
home
for
one
year
drive
from
your
heart
all
evil
feelings
not
for
the
sake
of
bathing
in
this
fountain
but
because
goodness
is
lovely
and
desirable
for
its
own
sake
then
your
work
is
marion
returned
home
this
was
the
hardest
task
of
all
for
she
had
been
willing
to
be
good
not
because
it
was
right
but
because
she
wished
to
be
beautiful
three
times
she
sought
the
grotto
and
three
times
she
left
in
tears
for
the
golden
specks
on
the
wings
of
the
purple
fairies
grew
dim
as
she
approached
and
the
golden
wands
were
still
crossed
to
shut
her
from
the
immortal
fountain
but
the
fourth
time
the
purple
fairies
lowered
their
wands
singing
hast
scaled
the
mountain
go
bathe
in
the
fountain
rise
fair
to
the
sight
as
an
angel
of
light
go
bathe
in
the
fountain
marion
full
of
joy
was
about
to
plunge
in
but
the
queen
touched
her
saying
look
in
the
mirror
of
the
water
art
thou
not
already
as
beautiful
as
heart
can
wish
marion
looked
at
herself
and
saw
that
her
eyes
sparkled
with
new
lustre
a
bright
colour
shone
in
her
cheeks
her
hair
waved
softly
about
her
face
and
dimples
played
sweetly
around
her
mouth
but
i
have
not
touched
the
immortal
fountain
cried
she
turning
in
surprise
to
the
queen
true
replied
the
queen
but
its
waters
have
been
within
your
soul
know
that
a
pure
and
happy
heart
and
gentleness
toward
others
are
the
only
immortal
fountains
of
beauty
marion
thanked
the
queen
and
joyfully
returned
home
rose
ran
to
meet
her
and
clasped
her
to
her
bosom
fervently
i
know
all
she
said
i
have
been
in
fairyland
disguised
as
a
bird
i
have
watched
all
your
steps
when
you
first
went
to
the
grotto
i
begged
the
queen
to
grant
your
ever
after
the
sisters
lived
lovingly
together
it
was
the
remark
of
every
one
how
handsome
marion
has
grown
the
ugly
scowl
has
departed
from
her
face
her
eyes
are
so
clear
and
gentle
her
mouth
is
so
pretty
and
smiling
to
my
taste
she
is
as
handsome
as
maria
the
story
of
childe
charity
once
upon
a
time
there
lived
in
the
west
country
a
little
girl
who
had
neither
father
nor
mother
they
both
died
when
she
was
very
young
and
left
their
daughter
to
the
care
of
her
uncle
who
was
the
richest
farmer
in
all
that
country
he
had
houses
and
lands
flocks
and
herds
many
servants
to
work
about
his
house
and
fields
a
wife
who
had
brought
him
a
great
dowry
and
two
fair
daughters
all
their
neighbours
being
poor
looked
up
to
the
family
insomuch
that
they
imagined
themselves
great
people
the
father
and
mother
were
as
proud
as
peacocks
the
daughters
thought
themselves
the
greatest
beauties
in
the
world
and
not
one
of
the
family
would
speak
civilly
to
anybody
they
thought
low
now
it
happened
that
though
she
was
their
near
relation
they
had
this
opinion
of
the
orphan
girl
partly
because
she
had
no
fortune
and
partly
because
of
her
humble
kindly
disposition
it
was
said
that
the
more
needy
and
despised
any
creature
was
the
more
ready
was
she
to
befriend
it
on
which
account
the
people
of
the
west
country
called
her
childe
charity
and
if
she
had
any
other
name
i
never
heard
it
childe
charity
was
thought
very
mean
in
that
proud
house
her
uncle
would
not
own
her
for
his
niece
her
cousins
would
not
keep
her
company
and
her
aunt
sent
her
to
work
in
the
dairy
and
to
sleep
in
the
back
garret
where
they
kept
all
sorts
of
lumber
and
dry
herbs
for
the
winter
the
servants
learned
the
same
tune
and
childe
charity
had
more
work
than
rest
among
them
all
the
day
she
scoured
pails
scrubbed
dishes
and
washed
crockeryware
but
every
night
she
slept
in
the
back
garret
as
sound
as
a
princess
could
in
her
palace
chamber
her
uncle
s
house
was
large
and
white
and
stood
among
green
meadows
by
a
river
s
side
in
front
it
had
a
porch
covered
with
a
vine
behind
it
had
a
farmyard
and
high
granaries
within
there
were
two
parlours
for
the
rich
and
two
kitchens
for
the
poor
which
the
neighbours
thought
wonderfully
grand
and
one
day
in
the
harvest
season
when
this
rich
farmer
s
corn
had
been
all
cut
down
and
housed
he
condescended
so
far
as
to
invite
his
neighborhood
to
a
harvest
supper
the
west
country
people
came
in
their
holiday
clothes
and
best
behaviour
such
heaps
of
cakes
and
cheese
such
baskets
of
apples
and
barrels
of
ale
had
never
been
at
feast
before
they
were
making
merry
in
kitchen
and
parlour
when
a
poor
old
woman
came
to
the
back
door
begging
for
broken
victuals
and
a
night
s
lodging
her
clothes
were
coarse
and
ragged
her
hair
was
scanty
and
grey
her
back
was
bent
her
teeth
were
gone
she
had
a
squinting
eye
a
clubbed
foot
and
crooked
fingers
in
short
she
was
the
poorest
and
ugliest
old
woman
that
ever
came
begging
the
first
who
saw
her
was
the
and
she
ordered
her
to
be
gone
for
an
ugly
witch
the
next
was
the
and
he
threw
her
a
bone
over
his
shoulder
but
childe
charity
hearing
the
noise
came
out
from
her
seat
at
the
foot
of
the
lowest
table
and
asked
the
old
woman
to
take
her
share
of
the
supper
and
sleep
that
night
in
her
bed
in
the
back
garret
the
old
woman
sat
down
without
a
word
of
thanks
all
the
company
laughed
at
childe
charity
for
giving
her
bed
and
her
supper
to
a
beggar
her
proud
cousins
said
it
was
just
like
her
mean
spirit
but
childe
charity
did
not
mind
them
she
scraped
the
pots
for
her
supper
that
night
and
slept
on
a
sack
among
the
lumber
while
the
old
woman
rested
in
her
warm
bed
and
next
morning
before
the
little
girl
awoke
the
old
woman
was
up
and
gone
without
so
much
as
saying
thank
you
or
good
illustration
childe
charity
came
out
and
asked
the
old
woman
to
take
her
share
of
the
supper
that
day
all
the
servants
were
sick
after
the
feast
and
mostly
cross
too
so
you
may
judge
how
civil
they
were
when
at
supper
time
who
should
come
to
the
back
door
but
the
old
woman
again
asking
for
broken
victuals
and
a
night
s
lodging
no
one
would
listen
to
her
or
give
her
a
morsel
till
childe
charity
rose
from
her
seat
at
the
foot
of
the
lowest
table
and
kindly
asked
her
to
take
her
supper
and
sleep
in
her
bed
in
the
back
garret
again
the
old
woman
sat
down
without
a
word
childe
charity
scraped
the
pots
for
her
supper
and
slept
on
the
sack
in
the
morning
the
old
woman
was
gone
but
for
six
nights
after
as
sure
as
the
supper
was
spread
there
was
she
at
the
back
door
and
the
little
girl
regularly
asked
her
in
childe
charity
s
aunt
said
she
would
let
her
get
enough
of
beggars
her
cousins
made
continual
game
of
what
they
called
her
genteel
visitor
sometimes
the
old
woman
said
child
why
don
t
you
make
this
bed
softer
and
why
are
your
blankets
so
thin
but
she
never
gave
her
a
word
of
thanks
nor
a
civil
good
morning
at
last
on
the
ninth
night
from
her
first
coming
when
childe
charity
was
getting
used
to
scrape
the
pots
and
sleep
on
the
sack
her
accustomed
knock
came
at
the
door
and
there
she
stood
with
an
ugly
dog
so
and
clumsy
that
no
would
keep
him
good
evening
my
little
girl
she
said
when
childe
charity
opened
the
door
i
will
not
have
your
supper
and
bed
i
am
going
on
a
long
journey
to
see
a
friend
but
here
is
a
dog
of
mine
whom
nobody
in
all
the
west
country
will
keep
for
me
he
is
a
little
cross
and
not
very
handsome
but
i
leave
him
to
your
care
till
the
shortest
day
in
all
the
year
then
you
and
i
will
count
for
his
when
the
old
woman
had
said
the
last
word
she
set
off
with
such
speed
that
childe
charity
lost
sight
of
her
in
a
minute
the
ugly
dog
began
to
fawn
upon
her
but
he
snarled
at
everybody
else
the
servants
said
he
was
a
disgrace
to
the
house
the
proud
cousins
wanted
him
drowned
and
it
was
with
great
trouble
that
childe
charity
got
leave
to
keep
him
in
an
old
ruined
ugly
and
cross
as
the
dog
was
he
fawned
on
her
and
the
old
woman
had
left
him
to
her
care
so
the
little
girl
gave
him
part
of
all
her
meals
and
when
the
hard
frost
came
took
him
privately
to
her
own
back
garret
because
the
was
damp
and
cold
in
the
long
nights
the
dog
lay
quietly
on
some
straw
in
a
corner
childe
charity
slept
soundly
but
every
morning
the
servants
would
say
to
her
what
great
light
and
fine
talking
was
that
in
your
back
garret
there
was
no
light
but
the
moon
shining
in
through
the
shutterless
window
and
no
talk
that
i
heard
said
childe
charity
and
she
thought
they
must
have
been
dreaming
but
night
after
night
when
any
of
them
awoke
in
the
dark
and
silent
hour
that
comes
before
the
morning
they
saw
a
light
brighter
and
clearer
than
the
christmas
fire
and
heard
voices
like
those
of
lords
and
ladies
in
the
back
garret
partly
from
fear
and
partly
from
laziness
none
of
the
servants
would
rise
to
see
what
might
be
there
at
length
when
the
winter
nights
were
at
the
longest
the
little
who
did
least
work
and
got
most
favour
because
she
gathered
news
for
her
mistress
crept
out
of
bed
when
all
the
rest
were
sleeping
and
set
herself
to
watch
at
a
crevice
of
the
door
she
saw
the
dog
lying
quietly
in
the
corner
childe
charity
sleeping
soundly
in
her
bed
and
the
moon
shining
through
the
shutterless
window
but
an
hour
before
daybreak
there
came
a
glare
of
lights
and
a
sound
of
bugles
the
window
opened
and
in
marched
a
troop
of
little
men
clothed
in
crimson
and
gold
and
bearing
every
man
a
torch
till
the
room
looked
bright
as
day
they
marched
up
with
great
reverence
to
the
dog
where
he
lay
on
the
straw
and
the
most
richly
clothed
among
them
said
royal
prince
we
have
prepared
the
banquet
hall
what
will
your
highness
please
that
we
do
next
ye
have
done
well
said
the
dog
now
prepare
the
feast
and
see
that
all
things
be
in
our
first
fashion
for
the
princess
and
i
mean
to
bring
a
stranger
who
never
feasted
in
our
halls
your
highness
s
commands
shall
be
obeyed
said
the
little
man
making
another
reverence
and
he
and
his
company
passed
out
of
the
window
by
and
by
there
was
another
glare
of
lights
and
a
sound
like
flutes
the
window
opened
and
there
came
in
a
company
of
little
ladies
clad
in
velvet
and
carrying
each
a
crystal
lamp
they
also
walked
with
great
reverence
up
to
the
dog
and
the
gayest
among
them
said
royal
prince
we
have
prepared
the
tapestry
what
will
your
highness
please
that
we
do
next
ye
have
done
well
said
the
dog
now
prepare
the
robes
and
let
all
things
be
in
our
first
fashion
for
the
princess
and
i
will
bring
with
us
a
stranger
who
never
feasted
in
our
halls
your
highness
s
commands
shall
be
obeyed
said
the
little
lady
making
a
low
curtsy
and
she
and
her
company
passed
out
through
the
window
which
closed
quietly
behind
them
the
dog
stretched
himself
out
upon
the
straw
the
little
girl
turned
in
her
sleep
and
the
moon
shone
in
on
the
back
garret
the
was
so
much
amazed
and
so
eager
to
tell
this
great
story
to
her
mistress
that
she
could
not
close
her
eyes
that
night
and
was
up
before
but
when
she
told
it
her
mistress
called
her
a
silly
wench
to
have
such
foolish
dreams
and
scolded
her
so
that
the
durst
not
mention
what
she
had
seen
to
the
servants
nevertheless
childe
charity
s
aunt
thought
there
might
be
something
in
it
worth
knowing
so
next
night
when
all
the
house
were
asleep
she
crept
out
of
bed
and
set
herself
to
watch
at
the
back
garret
door
there
she
saw
exactly
what
the
maid
told
her
the
little
men
with
the
torches
and
the
little
ladies
with
the
crystal
lamps
come
in
making
great
reverence
to
the
dog
and
the
same
words
pass
only
he
said
to
the
one
now
prepare
the
presents
and
to
the
other
prepare
the
and
when
they
were
gone
the
dog
stretched
himself
on
the
straw
childe
charity
turned
in
her
sleep
and
the
moon
shone
in
on
the
back
garret
the
mistress
could
not
close
her
eyes
any
more
than
the
maid
from
eagerness
to
tell
the
story
she
woke
up
childe
charity
s
rich
uncle
before
but
when
he
heard
it
he
laughed
at
her
for
a
foolish
woman
and
advised
her
not
to
repeat
the
like
before
the
neighbours
lest
they
should
think
she
had
lost
her
senses
the
mistress
could
say
no
more
and
the
day
passed
but
that
night
the
master
thought
he
would
like
to
see
what
went
on
in
the
back
garret
so
when
all
the
house
were
asleep
he
slipped
out
of
bed
and
set
himself
to
watch
at
the
crevice
in
the
door
the
same
thing
happened
again
that
the
maid
and
the
mistress
saw
the
little
men
in
crimson
with
their
torches
and
the
little
ladies
in
velvet
with
their
lamps
came
in
at
the
window
and
made
an
humble
reverence
to
the
ugly
dog
the
one
saying
royal
prince
we
have
prepared
the
presents
and
the
other
royal
prince
we
have
prepared
the
and
the
dog
said
to
them
all
ye
have
done
well
come
and
meet
me
and
the
princess
with
horses
and
chariots
and
let
all
things
be
in
our
first
fashion
for
we
will
bring
a
stranger
from
this
house
who
has
never
travelled
with
us
nor
feasted
in
our
halls
the
little
men
and
the
little
ladies
said
your
highness
s
commands
shall
be
when
they
had
gone
out
through
the
window
the
ugly
dog
stretched
himself
out
on
the
straw
childe
charity
turned
in
her
sleep
and
the
moon
shone
in
on
the
back
garret
the
master
could
not
close
his
eyes
any
more
than
the
maid
or
the
mistress
for
thinking
of
this
strange
sight
he
remembered
to
have
heard
his
grandfather
say
that
somewhere
near
his
meadows
there
lay
a
path
leading
to
the
fairies
country
and
the
haymakers
used
to
see
it
shining
through
the
grey
summer
morning
as
the
fairy
bands
went
home
nobody
had
heard
or
seen
the
like
for
many
years
but
the
master
concluded
that
the
doings
in
his
back
garret
must
be
a
fairy
business
and
the
ugly
dog
a
person
of
great
account
his
chief
wonder
was
however
what
visitor
the
fairies
intended
to
take
from
his
house
and
after
thinking
the
matter
over
he
was
sure
it
must
be
one
of
his
daughters
they
were
so
handsome
and
had
such
fine
clothes
accordingly
childe
charity
s
rich
uncle
made
it
his
first
business
that
morning
to
get
ready
a
breakfast
of
roast
mutton
for
the
ugly
dog
and
carry
it
to
him
in
the
old
but
not
a
morsel
would
the
dog
taste
on
the
contrary
he
snarled
at
the
master
and
would
have
bitten
him
if
he
had
not
run
away
with
his
mutton
the
fairies
have
strange
ways
said
the
master
to
himself
but
he
called
his
daughters
privately
bidding
them
dress
themselves
in
their
best
for
he
could
not
say
which
of
them
might
be
called
into
great
company
before
nightfall
childe
charity
s
proud
cousins
hearing
this
put
on
the
richest
of
their
silks
and
laces
and
strutted
like
peacocks
from
kitchen
to
parlour
all
day
waiting
for
the
call
their
father
spoke
of
while
the
little
girl
scoured
and
scrubbed
in
the
dairy
they
were
in
very
bad
humour
when
night
fell
and
nobody
had
come
but
just
as
the
family
were
sitting
down
to
supper
the
ugly
dog
began
to
bark
and
the
old
woman
s
knock
was
heard
at
the
back
door
childe
charity
opened
it
and
was
going
to
offer
her
bed
and
supper
as
usual
when
the
old
woman
said
this
is
the
shortest
day
in
all
the
year
and
i
am
going
home
to
hold
a
feast
after
my
travels
i
see
you
have
taken
good
care
of
my
dog
and
now
if
you
will
come
with
me
to
my
house
he
and
i
will
do
our
best
to
entertain
you
here
is
our
as
the
old
woman
spoke
there
was
a
sound
of
flutes
and
bugles
then
a
glare
of
lights
and
a
great
company
clad
so
grandly
that
they
shone
with
gold
and
jewels
came
in
open
chariots
covered
with
gilding
and
drawn
by
horses
the
first
and
finest
of
the
chariots
was
empty
the
old
woman
led
childe
charity
to
it
by
the
hand
and
the
ugly
dog
jumped
in
before
her
the
proud
cousins
in
all
their
finery
had
by
this
time
come
to
the
door
but
nobody
wanted
them
and
no
sooner
was
the
old
woman
and
her
dog
within
the
chariot
than
a
marvellous
change
passed
over
them
for
the
ugly
old
woman
turned
at
once
to
a
beautiful
young
princess
with
long
yellow
curls
and
a
robe
of
green
and
gold
while
the
ugly
dog
at
her
side
started
up
a
fair
young
prince
with
hair
and
a
robe
of
purple
and
silver
we
are
said
they
as
the
chariots
drove
on
and
the
little
girl
sat
astonished
a
prince
and
princess
of
fairyland
and
there
was
a
wager
between
us
whether
or
not
there
were
good
people
still
to
be
found
in
these
false
and
greedy
times
one
said
yes
and
the
other
said
no
and
i
have
lost
said
the
prince
and
must
pay
the
feast
and
some
of
the
farmer
s
household
who
were
looking
after
them
through
the
moonlight
night
said
the
chariots
had
gone
one
way
across
the
meadows
some
said
they
had
gone
another
and
till
this
day
they
can
not
agree
upon
the
direction
but
childe
charity
went
with
that
noble
company
into
a
country
such
as
she
had
never
seen
for
primroses
covered
all
the
ground
and
the
light
was
always
like
that
of
a
summer
evening
they
took
her
to
a
royal
palace
where
there
was
nothing
but
feasting
and
dancing
for
seven
days
she
had
robes
of
pale
green
velvet
to
wear
and
slept
in
a
chamber
inlaid
with
ivory
when
the
feast
was
done
the
prince
and
princess
gave
her
such
heaps
of
gold
and
jewels
that
she
could
not
carry
them
but
they
gave
her
a
chariot
to
go
home
in
drawn
by
six
white
horses
and
on
the
seventh
night
which
happened
to
be
christmas
time
when
the
farmer
s
family
had
settled
in
their
own
minds
that
she
would
never
come
back
and
were
sitting
down
to
supper
they
heard
the
sound
of
her
coachman
s
bugle
and
saw
her
alight
with
all
the
jewels
and
gold
at
the
very
back
door
where
she
had
brought
in
the
ugly
old
woman
the
fairy
chariot
drove
away
and
never
came
back
to
that
farmhouse
after
but
childe
charity
scrubbed
and
scoured
no
more
for
she
grew
a
great
lady
even
in
the
eyes
of
her
proud
cousins
the
shining
child
and
the
wicked
mouche
how
the
rich
cousins
came
once
upon
a
time
a
noble
but
poor
count
lived
in
the
lovely
land
of
alsace
he
dwelt
in
a
charming
little
house
on
a
hill
all
around
the
house
the
graceful
trees
stretched
out
their
leafy
branches
like
arms
as
if
they
were
saying
welcome
welcome
among
us
not
far
from
the
house
was
a
thick
green
wood
filled
with
birds
and
flowers
and
scented
grasses
the
good
count
did
not
live
alone
in
this
delightful
spot
no
indeed
his
wife
and
his
two
children
fanchon
and
frederic
lived
with
him
happy
and
contented
now
one
summer
the
news
arrived
that
a
wealthy
and
distinguished
nobleman
cousin
of
the
count
was
coming
the
next
day
with
his
family
to
call
upon
his
poor
relatives
the
following
morning
the
countess
got
up
very
early
and
baked
a
cake
into
which
she
put
more
almonds
and
raisins
than
she
ever
put
into
her
easter
cakes
so
that
its
delicious
fragrance
filled
the
house
the
count
dusted
and
brushed
his
old
green
waistcoat
while
fanchon
and
frederic
dressed
in
their
best
clothes
sat
waiting
for
the
guests
to
come
you
must
not
run
about
in
the
wood
as
you
usually
do
said
the
count
to
them
but
sit
very
still
so
that
you
will
look
clean
and
neat
when
your
cousins
so
the
poor
children
were
forced
to
stay
in
the
house
the
morning
sun
was
peeping
bright
and
smiling
from
behind
a
cloud
and
was
darting
his
rays
in
at
the
window
out
in
the
wood
the
breeze
was
blowing
sweet
and
fresh
and
the
robins
the
thrushes
the
goldfinches
and
the
nightingales
were
all
warbling
their
loveliest
songs
poor
fanchon
sat
still
and
listened
sometimes
smoothing
the
bow
on
her
pink
sash
and
sometimes
knitting
a
bit
and
all
the
while
longing
to
run
away
to
the
wood
as
for
frederic
he
was
looking
at
a
picture
book
but
he
kept
jumping
up
every
minute
to
gaze
out
at
the
window
for
the
big
house
dog
pepin
was
barking
and
bounding
before
the
window
as
if
to
say
aren
t
you
coming
out
what
in
the
world
are
you
doing
in
that
stuffy
room
and
so
fanchon
and
frederic
had
to
remain
in
the
house
and
this
was
all
the
more
painful
because
the
which
was
on
the
table
gave
out
the
most
delicious
spicy
odours
yet
might
not
be
cut
until
the
cousins
came
oh
that
they
would
only
come
would
only
come
the
children
cried
and
almost
wept
with
impatience
at
last
the
loud
tramping
of
horses
was
heard
and
the
rumble
of
wheels
then
a
carriage
approached
so
brilliant
and
so
covered
with
golden
ornaments
that
the
children
were
amazed
for
they
had
never
seen
anything
like
it
the
carriage
stopped
before
the
house
and
a
very
tall
thin
gentleman
glided
out
with
the
help
of
a
footman
and
fell
into
the
arms
of
the
count
to
whose
cheek
he
gently
pressed
his
lips
then
the
footman
aided
a
stout
woman
to
alight
while
two
children
a
boy
and
a
girl
stepped
languidly
down
after
her
when
they
were
all
safely
in
the
house
fanchon
and
frederic
came
forward
and
curtsied
politely
as
their
father
had
told
them
to
do
then
each
seized
a
hand
of
the
tall
gentleman
saying
we
are
glad
you
are
come
noble
cousin
after
which
they
permitted
the
lady
to
embrace
them
then
they
went
up
to
the
children
but
stood
before
them
silent
and
amazed
indeed
these
rich
children
were
wonderfully
dressed
the
boy
wore
a
little
jacket
of
scarlet
cloth
embroidered
with
gold
and
ornamented
with
gold
tassels
a
bright
little
sword
hung
at
his
side
on
his
head
was
a
curious
red
cap
with
a
white
feather
from
under
which
peeped
his
yellow
face
and
bleared
eyes
the
little
girl
had
on
a
white
dress
all
ribbons
lace
and
bows
and
her
hair
was
frizzled
and
curled
into
a
knot
on
top
of
which
was
a
shining
coronet
fanchon
plucked
up
courage
and
was
going
to
take
the
little
girl
s
hand
but
she
snatched
it
away
in
such
a
hurry
and
looked
so
tearful
and
angry
that
fanchon
was
frightened
and
let
her
alone
frederic
wished
to
have
a
closer
look
at
the
boy
s
sword
and
put
out
his
hand
to
touch
it
when
the
youngster
began
to
shout
and
cry
my
sword
my
sword
he
is
going
to
take
my
sword
and
ran
to
his
father
and
hid
behind
him
after
that
fanchon
and
frederic
stood
back
quietly
while
their
mother
cut
the
cake
and
the
older
people
talked
the
two
rich
children
sat
munching
dry
crackers
for
their
parents
said
that
cake
was
not
good
for
them
but
fanchon
and
frederic
each
had
a
large
slice
which
their
dear
mother
gave
them
after
they
had
finished
eating
the
guests
arose
to
say
and
the
glittering
carriage
was
driven
to
the
door
the
footman
took
from
it
two
large
bandboxes
these
the
rich
children
handed
with
condescending
pride
to
fanchon
and
frederic
and
just
as
the
guests
were
about
to
take
their
leave
the
dog
pepin
frederic
s
faithful
friend
and
darling
came
dancing
and
barking
around
them
the
rich
children
screamed
and
had
to
be
lifted
kicking
with
fright
into
the
carriage
which
immediately
drove
away
so
ended
the
visit
of
these
wealthy
distinguished
and
noble
cousins
the
new
playthings
after
the
carriage
containing
the
wealthy
cousins
had
rolled
down
the
hill
the
count
threw
off
his
green
waistcoat
and
put
on
his
loose
jacket
and
ran
his
fingers
through
his
hair
the
children
too
quickly
got
out
of
their
best
clothes
and
felt
light
and
happy
to
the
wood
to
the
wood
shouted
frederic
jumping
as
high
as
he
could
for
joy
but
don
t
you
wish
to
see
what
is
in
these
handsome
bandboxes
your
cousins
gave
you
asked
his
mother
and
fanchon
who
had
been
gazing
at
the
bandboxes
with
longing
eyes
cried
out
can
t
we
open
them
first
and
go
to
the
wood
afterward
but
frederic
was
hard
to
convince
surely
that
stupid
boy
could
not
have
brought
anything
worth
while
said
he
scornfully
nor
his
ribbony
sister
he
talked
so
boldly
about
bears
and
lions
but
when
my
dear
pepin
barked
he
forgot
his
sword
and
hid
under
the
table
a
brave
sportsman
he
oh
dear
good
brother
cried
fanchon
just
let
us
take
one
peep
at
what
is
in
the
boxes
so
frederic
who
always
did
what
he
could
to
please
his
sister
gave
up
the
idea
of
being
off
to
the
wood
at
once
and
sat
down
patiently
beside
the
table
where
the
bandboxes
were
the
mother
opened
them
and
then
oh
my
dear
readers
if
you
could
have
seen
what
lay
within
the
loveliest
toys
were
in
those
boxes
and
candies
and
sweet
cakes
and
nuts
the
children
clapped
their
hands
again
and
again
crying
oh
how
nice
oh
how
delicious
they
took
them
all
out
of
the
boxes
and
piled
them
on
the
table
none
of
the
toys
caused
frederic
such
satisfaction
as
did
a
little
hunter
who
when
a
string
that
stuck
out
from
his
jacket
was
pulled
put
a
gun
to
his
shoulder
and
fired
at
a
target
next
to
him
in
frederic
s
affections
was
a
little
fellow
who
bowed
and
twanged
on
a
harp
whenever
frederic
turned
a
tiny
handle
and
what
pleased
him
nearly
as
much
was
a
shotgun
of
wood
and
a
hunting
pouch
and
belt
fanchon
was
equally
delighted
with
a
beautiful
doll
a
trunk
filled
with
doll
s
dresses
tiny
shoes
hats
and
other
lovely
clothes
and
a
set
of
charming
doll
s
furniture
the
two
children
forgot
all
about
the
wood
and
enjoyed
themselves
with
their
playthings
until
quite
late
in
the
evening
they
then
went
to
bed
and
slept
soundly
what
happened
to
the
playthings
in
the
wood
the
next
morning
the
children
got
their
boxes
and
took
out
the
playthings
and
began
to
play
then
just
as
on
the
day
before
the
sun
shone
brightly
in
at
the
window
the
trees
rustled
in
the
breeze
and
the
birds
sang
their
loveliest
songs
at
last
frederic
cried
out
why
do
we
sit
here
in
this
stuffy
room
i
ll
tell
you
what
we
ll
do
come
fanchon
let
us
be
off
to
the
wood
fanchon
had
just
undressed
her
doll
and
was
going
to
put
it
to
bed
why
can
t
we
stay
here
she
begged
and
play
a
little
longer
frederic
i
ll
tell
you
what
we
ll
do
he
replied
we
ll
take
our
toys
out
to
the
wood
i
ll
put
on
my
pouch
and
belt
and
carry
my
gun
i
ll
be
a
real
sportsman
the
hunter
and
the
harper
may
come
too
and
you
may
take
your
doll
come
along
let
s
be
off
fanchon
hastened
to
dress
her
doll
then
they
both
ran
out
of
the
house
and
off
to
the
wood
there
they
sat
down
on
a
nice
grassy
spot
and
after
they
had
played
a
while
fanchon
said
do
you
know
frederic
that
harper
of
yours
does
not
play
very
well
just
listen
how
funny
his
harp
sounds
out
here
in
the
wood
with
that
eternal
ting
ping
ping
frederic
turned
the
handle
more
violently
you
re
right
fanchon
said
he
what
the
little
fellow
plays
sounds
quite
horrible
he
must
make
a
better
job
of
it
and
with
that
he
unscrewed
the
handle
with
such
force
that
crack
the
box
on
which
the
harper
stood
flew
into
a
thousand
splinters
and
the
arms
of
the
little
fellow
were
broken
and
hung
useless
at
his
sides
oh
oh
cried
frederic
ah
the
poor
little
harper
sighed
fanchon
well
he
was
a
stupid
creature
said
frederic
he
played
very
poor
music
and
bowed
and
made
faces
like
our
cousin
who
gave
him
to
and
as
frederic
spoke
he
threw
the
harper
into
a
thicket
what
i
like
is
my
hunter
he
continued
he
hits
the
bull
s
eye
every
time
he
and
with
that
frederic
jerked
the
string
so
violently
that
twang
the
target
was
broken
and
the
little
man
s
arms
hung
limp
and
motionless
ah
ah
cried
frederic
you
could
shoot
at
your
target
but
out
here
you
can
t
shoot
at
all
and
so
saying
frederic
with
all
his
might
shied
the
hunter
after
the
harper
into
the
thicket
come
let
us
run
about
a
bit
said
he
to
fanchon
ah
yes
let
us
said
she
this
lovely
doll
of
mine
shall
run
with
us
it
will
be
great
fun
so
fanchon
and
frederic
took
each
an
arm
of
the
doll
and
off
they
ran
through
the
bushes
on
and
on
until
they
came
to
a
small
lake
there
they
stopped
and
frederic
said
suppose
we
wait
a
minute
i
have
a
gun
now
and
perhaps
i
may
hit
a
duck
among
the
at
that
moment
fanchon
screamed
out
oh
just
look
at
my
doll
what
s
the
matter
with
her
indeed
the
poor
thing
was
in
a
miserable
condition
neither
fanchon
nor
frederic
had
been
paying
any
attention
to
her
and
the
bushes
had
torn
all
the
clothes
off
her
back
both
her
legs
were
broken
while
her
pretty
waxen
face
was
covered
with
so
many
scratches
that
it
was
hideous
to
look
at
oh
my
beautiful
beautiful
child
sobbed
fanchon
there
you
see
what
a
stupid
creature
that
doll
of
yours
is
cried
frederic
she
can
t
even
take
a
little
run
but
she
must
tear
and
spoil
her
clothes
give
her
to
me
and
before
fanchon
could
say
a
word
or
cry
oh
oh
frederic
snatched
the
doll
and
flung
her
into
the
lake
never
mind
fanchon
said
he
consolingly
never
mind
if
i
can
shoot
a
duck
you
shall
have
the
most
beautiful
just
then
a
noise
was
heard
among
the
rushes
and
frederic
instantly
took
aim
with
his
wooden
gun
but
he
dropped
it
quickly
from
his
shoulder
saying
am
i
not
an
idiot
how
can
a
fellow
shoot
a
duck
without
powder
and
shot
what
s
the
use
of
this
stupid
wooden
thing
anyway
with
that
he
flung
the
gun
and
his
pouch
and
belt
into
the
lake
but
poor
fanchon
was
weeping
at
the
loss
of
her
doll
and
frederic
was
annoyed
at
the
way
things
had
turned
out
so
they
both
crept
back
sadly
to
the
house
and
when
their
mother
asked
them
what
had
become
of
the
playthings
frederic
truthfully
related
how
they
had
been
deceived
by
the
harper
the
hunter
the
doll
and
all
ah
you
foolish
children
cried
their
mother
half
in
anger
you
do
not
deserve
to
have
nice
toys
but
the
count
who
had
been
listening
to
frederic
s
tale
said
let
the
children
alone
i
am
really
glad
that
they
are
fairly
rid
of
those
playthings
there
was
something
queer
about
but
neither
the
children
nor
their
mother
understood
what
the
count
meant
the
stranger
child
soon
after
these
events
very
early
one
morning
fanchon
and
frederic
ran
off
to
the
wood
they
were
feeling
sad
for
their
mother
had
told
them
that
they
must
return
home
soon
to
study
so
as
to
be
ready
for
the
tutor
that
their
rich
cousin
had
promised
to
send
them
for
the
tutor
was
expected
shortly
let
us
run
and
jump
as
much
as
we
can
now
said
frederic
when
they
reached
the
wood
for
in
a
little
while
we
shall
not
be
allowed
to
stay
out
here
at
all
so
they
began
to
play
but
everything
went
wrong
the
wind
carried
frederic
s
hat
into
the
bushes
he
stumbled
and
fell
on
his
nose
as
he
was
running
fanchon
found
herself
hanging
by
her
clothes
on
a
and
she
banged
her
foot
against
a
sharp
stone
so
that
she
shrieked
with
pain
in
fact
the
children
could
not
understand
what
was
the
matter
with
them
on
this
particular
day
and
they
gave
up
their
game
and
slunk
dejectedly
through
the
wood
frederic
threw
himself
down
under
a
shady
tree
and
fanchon
followed
his
example
and
there
the
two
children
lay
gloomy
and
wretched
gazing
on
the
ground
ah
said
fanchon
if
we
only
had
our
playthings
nonsense
said
frederic
what
should
we
do
with
them
i
ll
tell
you
what
it
is
fanchon
mother
is
right
i
suspect
the
toys
were
good
enough
but
we
didn
t
know
how
to
play
with
them
if
we
were
as
learned
as
our
rich
cousins
we
should
be
so
wise
that
all
our
toys
would
now
be
whole
and
we
should
know
how
to
play
with
them
and
at
that
fanchon
began
to
sob
and
cry
bitterly
and
frederic
joined
her
and
they
both
howled
and
lamented
until
the
wood
rang
again
and
again
oh
poor
unfortunate
children
that
we
are
oh
that
we
were
as
wise
as
our
cousins
but
suddenly
they
both
stopped
crying
and
asked
each
other
in
amazement
do
you
hear
anything
fanchon
do
you
hear
anything
frederic
for
out
of
the
deepest
shade
of
the
dark
thicket
in
front
of
the
children
a
wonderful
brightness
began
to
shine
playing
like
moonlight
over
the
leaves
that
trembled
as
if
in
joy
then
through
the
whispering
trees
came
a
sweet
musical
note
like
the
sound
of
a
harp
the
children
lay
motionless
with
awe
all
their
sorrow
passed
away
from
them
and
tender
happy
tears
rose
into
their
eyes
as
the
radiance
streamed
brighter
and
brighter
through
the
bushes
and
the
marvellous
music
grew
louder
and
louder
the
children
s
hearts
beat
high
they
gazed
eagerly
at
the
brightness
then
they
saw
smiling
at
them
from
the
thicket
the
most
beautiful
face
of
a
child
with
the
sun
beaming
on
it
in
splendour
oh
come
to
us
come
to
us
darling
shining
child
cried
fanchon
and
frederic
stretching
out
their
arms
and
their
hearts
were
filled
with
an
indescribable
longing
i
am
coming
i
am
coming
a
sweet
voice
cried
from
the
bushes
and
then
as
if
borne
on
the
wings
of
the
breeze
the
stranger
child
seemed
to
float
hovering
toward
fanchon
and
frederic
how
the
shining
child
played
with
fanchon
and
frederic
what
is
the
matter
dear
children
asked
the
stranger
child
i
heard
you
crying
and
lamenting
and
i
was
very
sorry
for
you
what
do
you
want
ah
said
frederic
we
did
not
know
what
we
wanted
but
now
i
see
that
we
wanted
just
you
yourself
that
s
it
chimed
in
fanchon
now
that
you
are
with
us
we
are
happy
again
why
were
you
so
long
in
coming
in
fact
both
children
felt
as
if
they
had
known
and
played
with
the
stranger
child
all
their
lives
and
that
their
unhappiness
had
been
because
their
beloved
playmate
was
not
with
them
you
see
frederic
added
we
have
no
toys
left
for
i
like
a
stupid
dolt
broke
all
our
fine
things
and
shied
them
into
the
at
this
the
stranger
child
laughed
merrily
and
cried
why
fanchon
and
frederic
you
are
lying
this
minute
among
the
loveliest
playthings
that
ever
were
seen
where
where
are
they
fanchon
and
frederic
both
cried
look
around
you
said
the
stranger
child
then
fanchon
and
frederic
saw
how
out
of
the
thick
grass
and
moss
all
sorts
of
glorious
flowers
were
peeping
with
bright
eyes
gleaming
and
between
them
many
coloured
stones
and
crystal
shells
sparkled
and
shone
while
little
golden
insects
danced
up
and
down
humming
gentle
songs
now
we
will
build
a
palace
said
the
stranger
child
help
me
to
get
the
stones
and
it
stooped
down
and
began
to
pick
up
stones
of
many
pretty
colours
fanchon
and
frederic
helped
and
the
stranger
child
placed
the
beautiful
stones
one
upon
another
and
soon
there
rose
tall
pillars
shining
in
the
sun
while
an
airy
golden
roof
stretched
itself
from
pillar
to
pillar
then
the
stranger
child
kissed
the
flowers
that
were
peeping
from
the
grass
and
whispered
to
them
lovingly
and
they
shot
up
higher
and
higher
and
twining
together
formed
arbours
and
covered
walks
in
which
the
children
danced
about
full
of
delight
and
gladness
the
stranger
child
clapped
its
hands
and
immediately
the
golden
roof
that
was
made
of
insects
golden
wings
fell
to
pieces
with
a
hum
and
the
pillars
melted
away
into
a
splashing
silver
stream
on
whose
banks
flowers
grew
and
peeped
into
the
water
then
the
stranger
child
plucked
little
blades
of
grass
and
gathered
twigs
from
trees
strewing
them
on
the
ground
before
fanchon
and
frederic
the
blades
of
grass
turned
into
the
prettiest
little
live
dolls
ever
seen
and
the
twigs
became
gay
little
huntsmen
the
dolls
danced
around
fanchon
and
let
her
take
them
in
her
lap
and
they
whispered
in
such
delicate
little
voices
be
kind
to
us
love
us
dear
the
huntsmen
shouted
halloa
halloa
the
hunt
s
up
and
blew
their
horns
and
bustled
about
then
tiny
hares
came
darting
out
of
the
bushes
with
tiny
dogs
after
them
and
the
huntsmen
pursued
them
with
shouts
this
was
delightful
then
suddenly
these
wonders
disappeared
and
fanchon
and
frederic
cried
out
what
has
become
of
the
dolls
where
are
the
huntsmen
the
stranger
child
answered
oh
they
are
always
here
waiting
for
you
they
are
close
beside
you
so
you
may
have
them
at
any
minute
but
just
now
would
you
not
rather
go
with
me
through
the
wood
oh
yes
yes
cried
fanchon
and
frederic
the
stranger
child
took
hold
of
their
hands
crying
come
come
and
with
that
off
they
went
the
children
felt
themselves
floating
along
lightly
and
easily
through
the
trees
while
all
the
birds
flew
fluttering
beside
them
singing
and
warbling
their
sweetest
songs
then
suddenly
up
they
soared
into
the
air
higher
and
higher
they
mounted
like
birds
skimming
above
the
tops
of
the
trees
frederic
shouted
with
delight
but
fanchon
was
frightened
oh
my
breath
is
going
i
shall
tumble
she
cried
and
just
at
that
moment
the
stranger
child
let
them
down
gently
to
the
ground
and
said
now
i
shall
sound
my
then
for
and
the
stranger
child
took
out
a
little
horn
of
wreathed
gold
and
began
to
sound
it
so
beautifully
that
the
whole
wood
reëchoed
wondrously
with
its
lovely
music
while
a
host
of
nightingales
came
flocking
to
the
branches
above
the
children
s
heads
and
sang
their
most
melodious
songs
but
all
at
once
the
music
grew
fainter
and
fainter
and
only
a
soft
whispering
seemed
to
come
from
the
thicket
into
which
the
stranger
child
had
vanished
i
will
come
again
the
children
heard
breathed
gently
as
if
from
a
distance
then
they
sighed
with
joy
for
though
they
could
not
understand
it
never
had
they
known
such
happiness
in
all
their
lives
oh
i
wish
it
was
now
they
both
cried
as
they
hastened
home
to
their
parents
how
the
forest
talked
to
fanchon
and
frederic
i
should
fancy
that
the
children
had
dreamed
all
this
said
the
count
to
his
wife
when
fanchon
and
frederic
who
could
think
of
nothing
else
but
the
stranger
child
and
the
wonderful
events
and
the
exquisite
music
had
told
all
that
had
happened
i
should
fancy
that
they
had
dreamed
all
this
if
they
had
not
both
seen
the
same
things
i
can
not
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
all
don
t
bother
your
head
about
it
my
dear
answered
his
wife
i
think
this
stranger
child
was
nobody
but
the
schoolmaster
s
son
from
the
village
we
must
take
care
that
he
is
not
allowed
to
put
any
more
such
nonsense
into
the
children
s
but
the
count
could
not
agree
with
her
for
he
called
the
children
to
him
again
to
tell
how
the
stranger
child
was
dressed
and
looked
fanchon
and
frederic
both
agreed
that
its
face
was
fair
as
lilies
that
it
had
cheeks
like
roses
cherry
lips
bright
blue
eyes
and
locks
of
gold
and
that
it
was
more
beautiful
than
words
could
tell
but
what
they
said
about
its
dress
sounded
absurd
for
fanchon
said
that
its
dress
was
wondrous
beautiful
shining
and
gleaming
as
if
made
of
the
petals
of
flowers
while
frederic
insisted
that
its
garments
were
of
sparkling
like
in
the
sunshine
and
frederic
thought
that
the
stranger
child
was
a
boy
while
fanchon
was
sure
that
it
was
a
girl
and
these
contradictions
confused
their
parents
and
the
count
shook
his
head
wonderingly
the
next
day
fanchon
and
frederic
hastened
to
the
wood
and
found
the
stranger
child
waiting
for
them
if
their
play
had
been
glorious
the
day
before
it
was
ten
times
more
glorious
for
the
stranger
child
did
such
marvellous
things
that
fanchon
and
frederic
shouted
for
joy
while
they
played
the
stranger
child
talked
sweetly
to
the
trees
flowers
and
birds
and
to
the
brook
that
ran
through
the
wood
and
they
all
answered
so
clearly
that
fanchon
and
frederic
understood
everything
they
said
dear
children
cried
the
why
were
you
not
here
early
when
my
friend
the
morning
breeze
came
rustling
over
the
blue
hills
and
brought
us
thousands
of
greetings
and
kisses
from
the
golden
queen
of
the
dawn
and
plenty
of
full
of
sweet
perfumes
oh
silence
the
flowers
broke
in
do
not
mention
that
robber
the
morning
breeze
does
he
not
steal
our
perfumes
never
mind
the
alders
children
let
them
lisp
and
whisper
listen
to
us
we
love
you
so
we
dress
ourselves
in
the
loveliest
colours
just
for
you
and
do
we
not
love
you
beautiful
flowers
said
the
stranger
child
tenderly
but
fanchon
knelt
down
on
the
grass
and
stretched
out
her
arms
as
if
she
would
take
all
the
bright
flowers
to
her
heart
and
cried
ah
i
love
you
i
love
you
every
one
then
came
a
sighing
out
of
the
tall
dark
firtrees
and
they
said
we
shade
the
flowers
from
the
hot
sun
and
shelter
human
children
when
the
storm
comes
rushing
through
the
woods
but
who
loves
us
in
return
groan
and
sigh
cried
frederic
and
murmur
as
much
as
you
like
you
green
giants
that
you
are
it
is
then
that
the
real
woodsman
s
heart
rejoices
in
you
i
love
all
the
green
bushes
the
flowers
and
you
trees
you
are
quite
right
splashed
the
brook
as
it
sparkled
over
its
stones
come
sit
down
among
this
moss
dear
children
and
listen
to
me
i
come
from
afar
out
of
a
deep
cool
dark
rock
i
gush
look
into
my
waves
and
i
will
show
you
the
loveliest
pictures
in
my
clear
mirror
the
blue
of
the
sky
the
fleecy
clouds
bushes
trees
and
blossoms
and
your
very
selves
dear
children
i
draw
tenderly
into
my
transparent
bosom
fanchon
and
frederic
said
the
stranger
child
looking
around
with
wondrous
blissfulness
only
listen
how
they
all
love
us
but
the
redness
of
evening
is
rising
behind
the
hills
and
the
nightingale
is
calling
me
home
oh
but
first
let
us
fly
a
little
as
we
did
yesterday
begged
frederic
yes
said
fanchon
but
not
quite
so
high
it
makes
my
head
then
the
stranger
child
took
them
each
by
the
hand
again
and
they
went
soaring
up
into
the
golden
purple
of
the
evening
sky
while
the
birds
crowded
and
sang
around
them
among
the
shining
clouds
frederic
saw
as
if
in
wavering
flame
beautiful
castles
all
of
rubies
and
other
precious
stones
look
look
fanchon
he
cried
full
of
rapture
look
at
those
splendid
palaces
let
us
fly
along
as
fast
as
we
can
and
we
shall
soon
get
to
fanchon
too
saw
the
castles
and
forgot
her
fear
and
kept
looking
upward
those
are
my
beloved
the
stranger
child
said
but
we
must
go
no
farther
fanchon
and
frederic
seemed
to
be
in
a
dream
and
could
not
make
out
how
they
suddenly
came
to
find
themselves
with
their
father
and
mother
the
palace
of
the
fairy
queen
it
was
the
next
day
in
the
most
beautiful
part
of
the
wood
beside
the
brook
between
whispering
bushes
the
stranger
child
had
set
up
a
glorious
tent
made
of
tall
slender
lilies
glowing
roses
and
tulips
of
every
hue
and
beneath
this
tent
fanchon
and
frederic
were
seated
with
the
stranger
child
listening
to
the
forest
brook
as
it
whirled
and
rippled
and
sang
its
wonderful
stories
tell
us
said
fanchon
darling
shining
child
where
your
home
is
and
all
about
your
father
and
the
stranger
child
looked
sorrowfully
at
the
sky
ah
my
dear
it
said
with
a
sigh
is
it
not
enough
that
i
come
to
you
each
day
why
must
you
then
ask
about
my
home
though
you
were
to
travel
day
after
day
forever
and
ever
even
to
beyond
the
utmost
range
of
the
purple
hills
you
could
not
reach
it
ah
me
sighed
fanchon
then
you
must
live
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
miles
away
from
us
is
it
only
on
a
visit
that
you
are
here
fanchon
beloved
said
the
stranger
child
whenever
you
long
for
me
with
all
your
heart
i
am
with
you
immediately
bringing
you
all
those
plays
and
wonders
is
that
not
as
good
as
being
in
my
home
not
at
all
said
frederic
for
i
believe
that
you
live
in
a
most
glorious
place
i
do
not
care
how
hard
the
road
is
to
your
home
i
mean
to
set
out
this
minute
for
and
so
you
shall
said
the
stranger
child
smiling
for
when
you
see
all
this
so
clearly
before
you
and
make
up
your
mind
to
be
there
it
is
as
good
as
done
the
land
where
i
live
in
truth
is
so
beautiful
and
glorious
that
i
can
give
you
no
description
of
it
it
is
my
mother
who
reigns
over
that
land
all
glory
and
loveliness
as
ah
you
are
a
prince
cried
frederic
ah
you
are
a
princess
cried
fanchon
i
certainly
am
said
the
stranger
child
my
mother
s
palace
is
far
more
beautiful
than
those
glittering
castles
you
saw
in
the
evening
clouds
for
the
gleaming
pillars
of
her
palace
are
of
the
purest
crystal
and
they
soar
slender
and
tall
into
the
blue
of
heaven
upon
them
rests
a
great
wide
blue
canopy
beneath
the
canopy
sail
the
shining
white
clouds
hither
and
thither
on
golden
wings
and
the
red
of
the
evening
and
the
morning
rises
and
falls
and
the
sparkling
stars
dance
in
a
singing
circle
around
her
palace
you
have
heard
of
the
fairies
who
can
bring
about
great
wonders
my
mother
is
queen
of
the
fairies
very
often
she
holds
a
feast
for
little
children
it
is
then
that
the
elves
belonging
to
my
mother
s
kingdom
fly
through
the
air
weaving
shining
rainbows
from
one
end
of
her
palace
to
the
other
under
these
rainbows
they
build
my
mother
s
diamond
throne
that
in
appearance
and
perfume
is
like
lilies
roses
and
carnations
my
mother
takes
her
place
upon
the
throne
and
the
elves
sing
and
play
on
golden
harps
as
soon
as
their
music
begins
everything
in
the
palace
and
in
the
woods
and
gardens
moves
and
sings
and
all
around
there
are
thousands
of
beautiful
little
children
in
charming
dresses
shouting
with
delight
the
children
chase
each
other
among
the
golden
trees
and
throw
blossoms
at
each
other
they
climb
the
trees
where
the
wind
swings
and
rocks
them
they
gather
fruit
and
they
play
with
tame
deer
and
other
gentle
wild
creatures
that
come
bounding
up
to
them
and
lick
their
hands
then
the
children
run
up
and
down
the
rainbows
or
they
ride
on
the
backs
of
great
purple
birds
that
fly
up
among
the
gleaming
clouds
how
delightful
that
must
be
cried
fanchon
and
frederic
with
rapture
oh
take
us
with
you
to
your
home
beautiful
shining
child
we
want
to
stay
there
always
that
may
not
be
said
the
stranger
child
and
fanchon
and
frederic
cast
down
their
eyes
sadly
to
the
ground
the
wicked
mouche
ah
said
the
stranger
child
you
might
not
be
so
happy
at
my
mother
s
court
indeed
it
would
be
a
great
misfortune
for
you
to
try
to
go
to
her
kingdom
there
are
many
children
who
can
not
bear
the
singing
of
the
purple
birds
and
if
they
hear
their
songs
they
die
then
too
destruction
might
overtake
you
before
you
could
reach
my
mother
s
court
even
i
am
not
safe
on
my
way
thither
there
was
a
time
when
i
was
safe
anywhere
but
now
a
bitter
enemy
of
my
mother
whom
she
banished
from
her
kingdom
goes
raging
about
the
world
and
i
can
not
be
safe
from
being
watched
pursued
and
molested
powerless
as
this
bitter
enemy
is
when
i
am
at
home
nothing
can
protect
me
from
him
when
i
am
flying
what
sort
of
a
hateful
creature
is
it
asked
fanchon
that
can
do
you
so
much
harm
i
have
told
you
said
the
stranger
child
that
my
mother
is
the
fairy
queen
among
her
many
elves
are
some
who
hover
in
the
sky
or
dwell
in
the
waters
and
others
who
serve
at
the
fairy
court
once
a
long
while
ago
there
came
among
those
that
served
at
court
a
stranger
who
called
himself
papillon
he
said
that
he
was
learned
in
all
the
sciences
of
the
world
and
could
accomplish
great
things
among
us
my
mother
made
him
prime
minister
papillon
soon
showed
his
natural
spite
and
wickedness
he
pretended
to
the
queen
that
he
loved
children
and
could
make
them
very
happy
but
instead
of
doing
so
he
hung
himself
like
a
weight
of
lead
on
the
tails
of
the
purple
birds
so
that
they
could
not
fly
aloft
and
when
the
children
climbed
the
he
dragged
them
down
by
the
legs
then
he
knocked
their
noses
on
the
ground
and
made
them
bleed
when
the
children
sang
he
crammed
all
sorts
of
nasty
stuff
down
their
throats
for
sweet
and
happy
singing
he
could
not
abide
and
worst
of
all
he
had
a
way
of
smearing
the
sparkling
precious
stones
of
the
palace
and
the
lilies
and
roses
and
even
the
shining
rainbows
with
a
horrible
black
juice
so
that
everything
beautiful
became
sorrowful
or
dead
and
when
he
had
done
all
this
he
gave
a
loud
hissing
laugh
and
said
that
everything
was
now
as
he
wished
it
to
be
then
shouting
that
he
was
greater
than
my
mother
he
went
flying
up
into
the
air
in
the
shape
of
an
enormous
fly
with
flashing
eyes
and
a
long
snout
after
which
he
went
humming
and
buzzing
around
my
mother
s
throne
in
a
most
abominable
fashion
when
the
queen
my
mother
and
her
elves
saw
this
they
knew
that
he
had
come
among
them
under
a
false
name
and
that
he
was
none
other
than
mouche
the
gloomy
king
of
the
gnomes
the
entire
fairy
court
thereupon
rushed
against
him
beating
him
with
their
wings
while
the
purple
birds
seized
him
with
their
glittering
beaks
and
gripped
him
so
tightly
that
he
screamed
with
agony
and
rage
after
which
the
birds
shook
him
violently
and
threw
him
down
to
the
earth
he
fell
straight
onto
the
back
of
his
old
aunt
who
was
a
great
blue
toad
and
she
carried
him
off
to
her
hole
but
five
hundred
of
the
children
in
the
fairy
court
armed
themselves
with
to
defend
themselves
against
mouche
if
he
should
ever
venture
to
return
now
after
he
was
gone
all
the
black
juice
disappeared
and
everything
became
as
shining
and
glorious
as
before
so
you
see
dear
children
continued
the
stranger
child
what
kind
of
a
creature
i
have
to
fear
this
horrible
mouche
follows
me
about
and
if
i
did
not
hide
myself
quickly
he
would
injure
me
and
i
assure
you
that
if
i
were
to
take
you
with
me
to
my
home
mouche
would
lie
in
wait
for
us
and
kill
fanchon
wept
bitterly
at
the
danger
to
which
the
stranger
child
was
exposed
but
frederic
said
if
that
horrible
mouche
is
nothing
but
a
great
fly
i
ll
soon
hit
him
with
father
s
big
and
if
once
i
give
him
a
good
crack
on
his
nose
aunty
blue
toad
will
have
a
job
carrying
him
to
her
hole
again
how
tutor
ink
arrived
to
teach
the
children
fanchon
and
frederic
ran
home
as
fast
as
they
could
shouting
as
they
went
oh
the
shining
child
is
a
beautiful
princess
oh
the
shining
child
is
a
beautiful
prince
they
wanted
in
their
delight
to
tell
this
to
their
parents
but
their
father
came
to
meet
them
with
a
most
extraordinary
man
walking
by
his
side
this
stranger
kept
muttering
to
himself
what
a
nice
pair
of
stupids
these
are
ah
ah
the
count
took
him
by
the
hand
and
said
to
the
children
this
gentleman
is
the
tutor
whom
your
kind
cousin
has
sent
to
teach
you
so
now
shake
hands
with
him
and
bid
him
but
the
children
looked
sidewise
at
him
and
could
move
neither
hand
nor
foot
this
was
because
they
had
never
seen
such
an
extraordinary
being
he
was
no
taller
than
frederic
his
body
was
round
and
bloated
and
his
little
weazen
legs
could
hardly
support
its
weight
his
head
was
queer
and
square
and
his
face
too
ugly
for
anything
for
not
only
was
his
nose
long
and
pointed
but
his
little
bulging
eyes
glittered
and
his
wide
mouth
was
opened
in
a
ferocious
way
he
was
clad
in
black
from
top
to
toe
and
his
name
was
tutor
ink
now
as
the
children
stood
staring
like
stone
images
their
mother
cried
out
angrily
you
rude
children
what
are
you
thinking
of
come
come
give
the
tutor
your
the
children
taking
heart
did
as
their
mother
bade
them
but
as
soon
as
tutor
ink
took
hold
of
their
hands
they
jumped
back
screaming
oh
oh
it
hurts
the
tutor
laughed
aloud
and
showed
a
needle
which
he
had
hidden
in
his
hand
to
prick
the
children
with
fanchon
was
weeping
but
frederic
growled
just
try
that
again
little
if
you
dare
why
did
you
do
that
tutor
ink
asked
the
count
somewhat
annoyed
well
it
s
just
my
way
answered
tutor
ink
i
can
t
alter
it
and
with
that
he
stuck
his
hands
to
his
sides
and
went
on
laughing
until
his
voice
sounded
like
the
noise
of
a
broken
rattle
alas
after
that
there
was
no
more
running
about
in
the
wood
instead
the
children
day
after
day
had
to
sit
in
the
house
repeating
after
tutor
ink
strange
gibberish
not
one
word
of
which
they
could
understand
with
what
longing
eyes
they
looked
at
the
wood
often
they
thought
they
heard
amidst
the
happy
songs
of
the
birds
and
the
rustling
of
the
trees
the
voice
of
the
stranger
child
calling
and
calling
fanchon
frederic
are
you
not
coming
to
play
with
me
oh
come
i
have
made
you
a
palace
all
of
flowers
we
will
play
there
and
i
will
give
you
all
sorts
of
beautiful
stones
and
then
we
ll
fly
through
the
air
and
build
come
oh
come
at
this
the
children
s
thoughts
were
so
drawn
to
the
wood
that
they
neither
heard
nor
saw
their
tutor
any
longer
although
he
thumped
on
the
table
with
both
his
fists
and
hummed
and
growled
and
snarled
at
last
one
day
the
count
perceived
how
pale
the
children
were
getting
and
bade
tutor
ink
take
them
for
a
walk
the
tutor
did
not
like
the
idea
at
all
and
the
children
did
not
like
it
either
saying
what
business
has
tutor
ink
in
our
darling
wood
what
happened
when
tutor
ink
took
the
children
to
the
wood
well
tutor
ink
is
it
not
delightful
here
in
our
wood
asked
frederic
tutor
ink
made
a
face
and
muttered
stupid
nonsense
all
one
does
is
to
tear
his
stockings
one
can
t
hear
a
word
because
of
the
abominable
screeching
of
the
birds
but
surely
you
love
the
flowers
fanchon
chimed
in
at
this
tutor
ink
s
face
became
a
deep
and
he
beat
his
hands
about
him
crying
stupid
nonsense
ridiculous
nonsense
there
are
no
decent
flowers
in
this
wood
but
don
t
you
see
those
dear
little
peeping
up
at
you
with
such
bright
loving
eyes
asked
fanchon
what
what
the
tutor
screamed
flowers
eyes
ha
ha
nice
eyes
useless
things
and
with
that
he
stooped
and
plucking
up
a
handful
of
the
lilies
roots
and
all
threw
them
into
the
thicket
fanchon
could
not
help
shedding
bitter
tears
and
frederic
gnashed
his
teeth
in
anger
just
then
a
little
robin
alighted
on
a
branch
near
the
tutor
s
head
and
began
to
sing
sweetly
the
tutor
picking
up
a
stone
threw
it
and
the
bird
fell
dying
to
the
ground
frederic
could
restrain
himself
no
longer
you
horrible
tutor
ink
he
cried
what
did
the
little
bird
do
to
you
that
you
should
strike
it
dead
and
looking
toward
the
thicket
he
called
sadly
oh
where
are
you
beautiful
shining
child
oh
come
only
come
let
us
fly
far
far
away
i
can
not
stay
beside
this
horrible
creature
any
and
fanchon
stretching
out
her
hands
sobbed
and
wept
bitterly
oh
you
darling
shining
child
she
cried
come
to
us
come
to
us
save
us
save
us
tutor
ink
is
killing
us
as
he
is
killing
the
flowers
and
birds
what
do
you
mean
by
the
shining
child
snarled
tutor
ink
but
at
that
instant
there
was
a
loud
whispering
and
a
rustling
in
the
thicket
and
a
sound
as
of
muffled
drums
tolling
in
the
distance
then
the
children
saw
in
a
shining
cloud
that
floated
above
them
the
beautiful
face
of
the
stranger
child
and
tears
like
glittering
pearls
were
rolling
down
its
rosy
cheeks
ah
darling
playmates
it
cried
i
can
not
come
to
you
any
more
farewell
farewell
the
gnome
mouche
has
you
in
his
power
oh
you
poor
children
and
then
the
stranger
child
soared
up
far
into
the
clouds
and
the
most
marvellous
thing
happened
behind
the
children
there
began
a
most
horrid
fearsome
buzzing
and
humming
snarling
and
growling
and
lo
tutor
ink
had
changed
into
an
enormous
fly
and
he
began
to
fly
upward
heavily
following
the
stranger
child
fanchon
and
frederic
overpowered
with
terror
ran
out
of
the
wood
and
did
not
dare
to
look
up
at
the
sky
until
they
had
got
some
distance
away
and
then
when
they
did
so
all
that
they
could
see
was
a
shining
speck
in
the
clouds
glittering
like
a
star
and
coming
nearer
and
downward
the
star
grew
bigger
and
bigger
and
the
children
could
hear
as
if
it
were
the
call
of
a
trumpet
and
presently
they
saw
that
the
star
was
really
a
splendid
bird
with
shining
purple
plumage
it
came
dropping
down
to
the
wood
clapping
its
mighty
wings
and
singing
loud
and
clear
hurrah
hurrah
shouted
frederic
that
is
a
purple
bird
from
the
fairy
court
he
will
bite
tutor
ink
to
death
the
shining
child
is
saved
and
so
are
we
come
fanchon
let
us
get
home
as
fast
as
we
can
and
tell
our
father
about
what
the
count
did
to
tutor
ink
the
children
burst
into
the
house
where
their
parents
were
sitting
hurrah
hurrah
frederic
shouted
the
purple
bird
has
bitten
tutor
ink
to
death
oh
father
dear
mother
dear
cried
fanchon
tutor
ink
is
not
tutor
ink
at
all
he
is
really
the
wicked
mouche
king
of
the
gnomes
a
monstrous
fly
but
a
fly
with
clothes
and
shoes
and
stockings
on
who
on
earth
has
been
putting
such
nonsense
into
your
heads
asked
the
countess
and
the
parents
gazed
at
the
children
in
utter
amazement
while
they
went
oh
to
tell
about
the
stranger
child
whose
mother
was
a
great
fairy
queen
and
about
the
gnome
king
mouche
and
the
purple
bird
the
count
grew
very
grave
and
thoughtful
frederic
said
he
you
are
really
a
sensible
boy
and
i
must
admit
that
tutor
ink
has
always
seemed
to
me
a
strange
mysterious
creature
your
mother
and
i
are
by
no
means
satisfied
with
him
particularly
your
mother
he
has
such
a
terrible
that
there
s
no
way
of
keeping
him
from
the
sugar
and
jams
and
then
he
hums
and
buzzes
in
such
a
distressing
manner
but
in
spite
of
all
this
my
dear
boy
just
think
calmly
for
a
minute
even
if
there
are
such
things
as
gnomes
in
the
world
do
you
really
mean
to
say
that
your
tutor
has
become
a
fly
frederic
looked
his
father
steadily
in
the
face
with
his
clear
blue
eyes
then
said
i
should
not
have
believed
it
myself
if
the
stranger
child
had
not
said
so
and
if
i
had
not
seen
with
my
own
eyes
that
he
is
only
a
horrible
fly
and
pretends
to
be
tutor
ink
and
then
continued
frederic
while
his
father
shook
his
head
in
wonder
see
what
mother
says
about
him
is
he
not
ravenous
for
sweet
things
is
that
not
just
like
a
fly
and
then
his
hummings
and
silence
cried
the
count
whatever
tutor
ink
is
one
thing
is
certain
the
purple
bird
has
not
bitten
him
to
death
for
there
he
comes
out
of
the
wood
at
this
the
children
uttered
loud
screams
and
rushed
behind
the
door
in
truth
tutor
ink
was
approaching
but
he
was
and
bewildered
he
was
buzzing
and
humming
and
springing
high
in
the
air
first
to
one
side
then
to
the
other
and
banging
his
head
against
the
trees
he
tumbled
into
the
house
and
dashed
at
the
and
popped
his
head
into
it
so
that
the
milk
ran
over
the
sides
then
he
gulped
and
gulped
making
a
horrid
noise
of
swallowing
what
ails
you
tutor
ink
cried
the
countess
what
are
you
about
are
you
out
of
your
senses
asked
the
count
is
the
foul
fiend
after
you
but
without
making
any
answer
tutor
ink
taking
his
mouth
from
the
threw
himself
down
on
the
dish
of
butter
and
began
to
lick
it
with
his
pointed
tongue
then
with
a
loud
buzzing
he
sprang
off
the
table
and
began
to
stagger
hither
and
thither
about
the
room
as
though
he
was
drunk
this
is
pretty
behaviour
cried
the
count
as
he
tried
to
seize
tutor
ink
by
the
coat
tails
but
tutor
ink
managed
to
elude
him
deftly
just
then
frederic
came
running
up
with
his
father
s
big
in
his
hand
and
gave
it
to
the
count
crying
here
you
are
father
knock
the
terrible
mouche
to
death
the
count
took
the
and
then
they
all
set
to
work
to
drive
away
tutor
ink
fanchon
and
frederic
and
their
mother
took
table
napkins
and
made
sweeps
with
them
in
the
air
driving
the
tutor
backward
and
forward
here
and
there
while
the
count
kept
striking
at
him
with
the
wilder
and
wilder
grew
the
chase
hum
and
sum
went
the
tutor
storming
hither
and
thither
flap
and
clap
went
the
table
napkins
and
at
last
the
count
managed
to
hit
the
tutor
s
coat
tails
then
just
as
the
count
was
going
to
strike
a
second
time
up
bounced
the
tutor
into
the
air
and
with
renewed
strength
stormed
humming
and
buzzing
out
of
the
door
and
away
among
the
trees
well
done
exclaimed
the
count
we
are
rid
of
that
abominable
tutor
ink
never
shall
he
cross
my
threshold
again
how
the
naughty
playthings
became
alive
fanchon
and
frederic
now
breathed
freely
once
more
a
great
weight
was
taken
off
their
hearts
they
rejoiced
that
now
since
the
wicked
mouche
was
gone
the
stranger
child
might
come
back
they
hurried
to
the
wood
everything
was
silent
and
deserted
not
a
merry
note
of
a
single
bird
was
there
instead
of
the
joyous
singing
of
the
brook
and
the
gladsome
rustling
of
the
leaves
they
seemed
to
hear
sighs
and
moans
that
passed
through
the
air
just
then
close
behind
them
snarling
voices
cried
out
stupid
creatures
senseless
creatures
you
despised
us
you
did
not
know
how
to
treat
us
we
are
come
back
to
punish
you
fanchon
and
frederic
looked
around
and
saw
the
little
hunter
and
the
harper
rise
out
of
the
thicket
the
harper
twanged
his
tiny
harp
while
the
hunter
took
aim
at
frederic
and
both
cried
out
wait
you
boy
and
girl
we
are
obedient
servants
of
tutor
ink
he
will
be
here
in
a
moment
and
then
we
ll
pay
you
well
for
despising
us
terrified
the
children
turned
to
run
away
when
the
doll
rose
up
out
of
the
thicket
and
squeaked
out
stupid
creatures
senseless
creatures
i
am
an
obedient
servant
of
tutor
ink
he
will
be
here
in
a
moment
and
then
i
ll
pay
you
well
for
despising
me
and
with
that
the
naughty
creature
sent
great
splashes
of
muddy
water
flying
at
fanchon
and
frederic
so
that
they
were
quite
wet
then
the
children
fell
on
their
knees
sobbing
oh
how
unfortunate
we
are
will
no
one
take
pity
on
us
scarcely
had
they
said
thus
when
the
playthings
disappeared
the
rushing
of
the
brook
turned
to
the
sweetest
music
all
the
wood
streamed
with
a
wonderful
sparkling
light
and
lo
the
stranger
child
came
forth
from
the
thicket
surrounded
by
such
brilliant
rays
that
fanchon
and
frederic
had
to
shut
their
eyes
for
a
minute
then
they
felt
themselves
touched
gently
and
the
stranger
child
s
sweet
voice
said
oh
do
not
mourn
for
me
dear
playmates
though
you
will
not
see
me
again
still
i
shall
be
near
you
neither
the
wicked
mouche
nor
any
other
gnome
shall
have
power
to
harm
you
only
go
on
loving
me
that
we
shall
that
we
shall
dear
shining
child
the
children
cried
we
love
you
with
all
our
hearts
and
at
last
when
they
could
open
their
eyes
the
stranger
child
had
vanished
and
all
their
grief
and
fear
were
gone
too
delight
beamed
in
their
eyes
and
shone
in
their
cheeks
and
what
the
stranger
child
had
said
came
to
pass
nothing
ever
harmed
fanchon
and
frederic
they
grew
up
handsome
clever
and
and
all
that
they
undertook
prospered
and
as
the
years
went
on
they
still
in
their
dreams
played
with
the
stranger
child
who
never
ceased
to
bring
them
the
loveliest
things
from
its
fairy
home
mabel
on
midsummer
day

earnest
speed
and
that
thou
break
no
living
bough
within
the
wood
take
heed
for
they
are
spiteful
brownies
who
in
the
wood
abide
so
be
thou
careful
of
this
thing
lest
evil
should
betide
but
think
not
little
mabel
whilst
thou
art
in
the
wood
of
dwarfish
wilful
brownies
but
of
the
father
good
and
when
thou
goest
to
the
spring
to
fetch
the
water
thence
do
not
disturb
the
little
stream
lest
this
should
give
offence
for
the
queen
of
all
the
fairies
she
loves
that
water
bright
i
ve
seen
her
drinking
there
myself
on
many
a
summer
night
but
she
s
a
gracious
lady
and
her
thou
need
st
not
fear
only
disturb
thou
not
the
stream
nor
spill
the
water
now
all
this
i
will
heed
mother
will
no
word
disobey
and
wait
upon
the
grandmother
this
summer
part
ii
away
tripped
little
mabel
with
the
wheaten
cake
so
fine
with
the
pat
of
butter
and
the
little
flask
of
wine
and
long
before
the
sun
was
hot
and
the
summer
mist
had
cleared
beside
the
good
old
grandmother
the
willing
child
appeared
and
all
her
mother
s
message
she
told
with
right
how
that
the
father
was
away
and
the
little
child
was
and
then
she
swept
the
hearth
up
clean
and
then
the
table
spread
and
next
she
fed
the
dog
and
bird
and
then
she
made
the
bed
and
go
now
said
the
grandmother
ten
paces
down
the
dell
and
bring
in
water
for
the
day
thou
know
st
the
the
first
time
that
good
mabel
went
nothing
at
all
saw
she
except
a
bird
a
bird
that
sat
upon
a
tree
the
next
time
that
good
mabel
went
there
sat
a
lady
bright
beside
the
well
a
lady
small
all
clothed
in
green
and
white
a
curtsey
low
made
mabel
and
then
she
stooped
to
fill
her
pitcher
at
the
sparkling
spring
but
no
drop
did
she
spill
thou
art
a
handy
maiden
the
fairy
lady
said
thou
hast
not
spilt
a
drop
nor
yet
the
fairy
spring
troublèd
and
for
this
thing
which
thou
hast
done
yet
may
st
not
understand
i
give
to
thee
a
better
gift
than
houses
or
than
land
thou
shalt
do
well
whate
er
thou
dost
as
thou
hast
done
this
day
shalt
have
the
will
and
power
to
please
and
shalt
be
loved
thus
having
said
she
passed
from
sight
and
naught
could
mabel
see
but
the
little
bird
the
bird
upon
the
leafy
tree
part
iii
and
now
go
said
the
grandmother
and
fetch
in
fagots
dry
all
in
the
neighbouring
beneath
the
trees
they
away
went
kind
good
mabel
into
the
near
where
all
the
ground
was
dry
and
brown
and
the
grass
grew
thin
and
sear
she
did
not
wander
up
and
down
nor
yet
a
live
branch
pull
but
steadily
of
the
fallen
boughs
she
picked
her
apron
full
and
when
the
wildwood
brownies
came
sliding
to
her
mind
she
drove
them
thence
as
she
was
told
with
sweet
and
kind
but
all
that
while
the
brownies
within
the
still
they
watched
her
how
she
picked
the
wood
and
strove
to
do
no
and
oh
but
she
is
small
and
neat
said
one
twere
shame
to
spite
a
creature
so
demure
and
meek
a
creature
harmless
quite
look
only
said
another
at
her
little
gown
of
blue
at
her
kerchief
pinned
about
her
head
and
at
her
little
shoe
oh
but
she
is
a
comely
child
said
a
third
and
we
will
lay
a
penny
in
her
path
a
boon
for
her
this
day
seeing
she
broke
no
living
wood
no
live
thing
did
affray
with
that
the
smallest
penny
of
the
finest
silver
ore
upon
the
dry
and
slippery
path
lay
mabel
s
feet
before
with
joy
she
picked
the
penny
up
the
fairy
penny
good
and
with
her
fagots
dry
and
brown
went
wandering
from
the
wood
now
she
has
that
said
the
brownies
let
flax
be
ever
so
dear
twill
buy
her
clothes
of
the
very
best
for
many
and
many
a
part
iv
and
go
now
said
the
grandmother
since
falling
is
the
dew
go
down
unto
the
lonesome
glen
and
milk
the
all
down
into
the
lonesome
glen
through
copses
thick
and
wild
through
moist
rank
grass
by
trickling
streams
went
on
the
willing
child
and
when
she
came
to
the
lonesome
glen
she
kept
beside
the
burn
and
neither
plucked
the
nor
broke
the
and
while
she
milked
the
within
this
lonesome
glen
she
wished
that
little
amy
were
strong
and
well
again
and
soon
as
she
had
thought
this
thought
she
heard
a
coming
sound
as
if
a
thousand
fairy
folk
were
gathering
all
around
and
then
she
heard
a
little
voice
shrill
as
the
midge
s
wing
that
spake
aloud
a
human
child
is
here
yet
mark
this
thing
the
is
all
unbroke
the
unta
en
what
shall
be
done
for
her
who
still
from
mischief
can
refrain
give
her
a
fairy
cake
said
one
grant
her
a
wish
said
three
the
latest
wish
that
she
hath
wished
said
all
whate
er
it
be
kind
mabel
heard
the
words
they
spake
and
from
the
lonesome
glen
unto
the
good
old
grandmother
went
gladly
back
again
thus
happened
it
to
mabel
on
that
midsummer
day
and
these
three
fairy
blessings
she
took
with
her
away
tis
good
to
make
all
duty
sweet
to
be
alert
and
kind
tis
good
like
little
mabel
to
have
a
willing
mind
farewell
farewell
dear
fairies
where
do
fairies
hide
their
heads
when
snow
lies
on
the
hills
when
frost
has
spoiled
their
mossy
beds
and
crystallized
their
rills
beneath
the
moon
they
can
not
trip
in
circles
o
er
the
plain
and
draughts
of
dew
they
can
not
sip
till
green
leaves
come
they
return
there
will
be
mirth
and
music
in
the
air
and
fairy
wings
upon
the
earth
and
mischief
everywhere
the
maids
to
keep
the
elves
aloof
will
bar
the
doors
in
vain
no
keyhole
will
be
when
green
leaves
come

growling
and
grumbling
and
goes
and
stumbling
and
tumbling
over
the
wares
in
his
way
to
the
door
but
he
sees
no
more
than
he
saw
before
till
a
voice
is
heard
o
ferryman
dear
here
we
are
waiting
all
of
us
here
we
are
a
wee
wee
colony
we
some
two
hundred
in
all
or
three
ferry
us
over
the
river
lee
ere

of

and
we
will
pay

we
may
in

own
wee
way
ii
who
are
you
whence
came
you
what
place
are
you
going
to
oh
we
have
dwelt
in
this
land
the
people
get
cross
and
are
growing
so
knowing
too
nothing
at
all
but
they
now
understand
we
are
daily
vanishing
under
the
thunder
of
some
huge
engine
or
iron
wonder
that
iron
ah
it
has
entered
our
souls
your
souls
o
gholes
you
queer
little
drolls
do
you
mean
good
gaffer
do
aid
us
with
speed
for
our
time
like
our
stature
is
short
indeed
and
a
very
long
way
we
have
to
go
eight
or
ten
thousand
miles
or
so
hither
and
thither
and
to
and
fro
with
our
pots
and
pans
and
little
gold
cans
but
our
light
caravans
run
swifter
than
man
s
iii
well
well
you
may
come
said
the
ferryman
affably
patrick
turn
out
and
get
ready
the
barge
then
again
to
the
little
folk
though
you
seem
laughably
small
i
don
t
mind
if
your
coppers
be
oh
dear
what
a
rushing
what
pushing
what
crushing
the
watermen
making
vain
efforts
at
hushing
the
hubbub
the
while
there
followed
these
words
what
clapping
of
boards
what
strapping
of
cords
what
stowing
away
of
children
and
wives
and
platters
and
mugs
and
spoons
and
knives
till
all
had
safely
got
into
the
boat
and
the
ferryman
clad
in
his
coat
and
his
wee
little
fairies
were
safely
afloat
then
ding
ding
ding
and
kling
kling
kling
how
the
coppers
did
ring
in
the
tin
pitcherling
iv
off
then
went
the
boat
at
first
very
pleasantly
smoothly
and
so
forth
but
after
a
while
it
swayed
and
it
swagged
this
and
that
way
and
presently
chest
after
chest
and
pile
after
pile
of
the
little
folks
goods
began
tossing
and
rolling
and
pitching
like
fun
beyond
fairy
controlling
o
mab
if
the
hubbub
were
great
before
it
was
now
some
two
or
three
million
times
more
crash
went
the
wee
crocks
and
the
clocks
and
the
locks
of
each
little
wee
box
were
stove
in
by
hard
knocks
and
then
there
were
oaths
and
prayers
and
cries
take

there
oh
dear

i
am
killed
i
am

well

he
looks
blank
as

poor
ferryman
round
him
and
round
him
he
gazes
but
only
gets
deeplier
lost
in
the
mazes
of
utter
bewilderment
all
all
are
gone
and
he
stands
alone
like
a
statue
of
stone
in
a
doldrum
of
wonder
he
turns
to
steer

a

salutes
