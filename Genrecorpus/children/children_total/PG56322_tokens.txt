the
mary

story
book
is
different
from
the
other
mary
frances
books
they
are
part
lessons
and
part
story
they
teach
something
about
cooking
and
sewing
knitting
and
crocheting
housekeeping
and
gardening
and
and
tell
a
story
too
but
the
mary
frances
story
book
is
all
story
on
a
summer
afternoon
mary
frances
took
a
holiday
and
sailed
away
across
the
blue
water
to
an
island
an
island
formed
by
the
top
of
a
coral
mountain
resting
in
a
sea
of
blue
oh
so
blue
a
brighter
blue
than
the
water
in
your
mother
s
bluing
tub
not
the
blue
that
makes
you
feel
sad
and
blue
but
the
blue
that
makes
you
laugh
with
happiness
the
island
itself
and
the
roofs
of
the
houses
were
coral
white
and
the
green
was
the
green
of
the
palm
and
banana
and
mahogany
tree
the
breezes
that
blew
over
them
were
the
warm
soft
breezes
of
the
southern
sun
this
island
was
the
enchanted
island
of
the
good
which
mary
frances
was
allowed
to
visit
the
story
people
who
lived
there
believed
in
truth
and
beauty
and
courage
and
kindness
and
these
were
the
theme
of
their
stories
like
all
good
islands
this
island
had
enemies
but
they
came
to
a
bad
end
as
in
the
long
run
all
evil
persons
will
and
truth
and
beauty
and
courage
and
kindness
won
the
day
as
they
always
must
in
every
land
where
the
searchlight
of
the
sun
flashes
its
beams
as
may
be
imagined
when
mary
frances
came
home
she
had
not
only
one
but
many
stories
to
tell
and
they

mary
frances
leaned
down
and
caught
hold
of
his
fins
just
some
flying
fish
answered
the
cat
she
fed
him
a
little
at
a
time
with
a
medicine
dropper
on
one
of
the
flowers
was
perched
a
tiny
fairy
they
were
as
high
up
in
the
air
as
the
top
of
a
mountain
she
drank
long
and
eagerly
he
threw
the
necklace
around
coralie
s
neck
have
you
no
feelings
said
the
carrot
wow
shrieked
the
dragon
just
at
her
feet
lay
the
tiniest
little
bit
of
a
town
the
pony
cantered
all
the
way
down
the
street
she
ran
as
fast
as
she
could
and
was
just
in
time
to
drag
the
baby
out
of
the
way
of
the
wagon
mother
she
cried
oh
mother
the
magic
mask
was
ready
and
herlo
tried
it
on
the
king
s
face
but
all
the
united
efforts
of
bess
and
bob
and
archie
s
left
arm
could
not
raise
tom
he
swung
down
the
trail
with
a
speed
that
mocked
the
wind
at
his
back
she
then
touched
the
pitcher
with
her
wand
be
not
alarmed
dear
mistress
said
the
pitcher
immediately
he
grasped
the
sword
by
the
handle
but
could
not
stir
it
then
sir
galahad
took
his
place
in
the
field
a
monk
led
him
behind
the
altar
where
the
shield
hung
as
white
as
snow
but
in
the
center
was
a
red
cross
the
damsel
rode
as
fast
as
her
horse
would
gallop
that
night
and
all
the
next
day
till
they
came
in
sight
of
the
sea
slowly
sleep
came
upon
him
and
he
dreamed
away
went
the
schoolmaster
s
legs
cutting
such
capers
as
the
world
never
looked
upon
before
before
the
door
of
a
low
thatched
hut
stood
a
young
woman
once
he
thought
he
saw
them
a
tall
figure
stood
among
the
shadows
of
the
trees
toward
the
very
last
robert
the
jester
rode
on
a
piebald
pony
he
flung
the
book
into
the
sea
your
flag
and
my
flag
if
you
please
i
was
to
be
left
till
called
for
there
were
houses
in
it
furnished
and
unfurnished
for
dolls
of
all
stations
in
life
they
jogged
on
for
some
time
in
silence
the
trip
to
story
island
on
the
the
good
ferry
puts
out
to
the
pirate
s
the
lost
land
the
old
witch
and
the
finding
the
lost
the
pirate
chases
the
good
the
terrible
punishment
of
the
pirate
and
the
old
the
bubble
story
the
trip
to
story
island
i
on
the
shore
if
only
whispered
mary
frances
to
herself
as
she
closed
the
book
she
had
been
reading
if
only
one
could
find
the
enchanted
island
and
the
hidden
treasure
of
stories
i
wish
i
wish
the
story
told
how
to
get
there
she
was
sitting
on
the
branches
of
a
tree
which
were
so
bent
that
they
formed
a
sort
of
hammocky
rocking
chair
the
tree
was
close
to
the
bank
of
the
river
and
away
in
the
distance
the
whitecaps
of
the
ocean
rolled
up
and
broke
upon
the
beach
it
s
quite
a
journey
said
a
small
voice
quite
a
long
mary
frances
looked
all
around
but
could
not
find
where
the
voice
came
from
you
see
it
s
out
at
sea
continued
the
voice
and
only
one
boat
and
one
passenger
a
year
what
s
more
this
last
was
uttered
with
a
deep
sigh
why
where
are
you
who
are
you
asked
mary
frances
springing
up
here
i
am
but
i
won
t
be
long
continued
the
voice
you
d
better
look
lively
for
i
can
t
cling
to
this
fence
much
longer
besides
i
am
almost
out
of
element
then
the
little
girl
saw
a
dolphin
sitting
on
the
top
rail
of
the
fence
holding
on
with
one
fin
oh
she
cried
do
you
really
know
where
the
enchanted
island
is
will
you
tell
me
how
to
get
there
that
i
will
said
the
dolphin
that
i
will
if
you
ll
get
me
a
little
of
my
element
what
is
that
asked
mary
frances
why
you
couldn
t
live
without
yours
for
one
minute
i
ll
die
if
i
don
t
get
some
soon
oh
dear
what
can
it
be
whatever
in
the
world
is
your
element
i
don
t
want
you
to
die
be
quick
cried
the
dolphin
fanning
himself
with
the
other
fin
i
feel
very
faint
i
ll
get
some
water
stooping
quickly
mary
frances
filled
her
hat
before
she
could
dash
it
over
him
the
dolphin
ducked
his
head
into
the
hatful
of
water
thank
you
he
said
raising
his
head
you
re
not
so
dull
after
all
water
is
my
element
air
is
of
course
said
mary
frances
but
she
wondered
why
the
dolphin
didn
t
jump
back
into
the
water
the
reason
is
that
it
takes
me
so
long
to
climb
a
fence
oh
said
mary
frances
although
she
didn
t
see
why
the
dolphin
had
to
sit
on
a
fence
to
talk
so
that
there
ll
be
no
offense
said
the
dolphin
after
staring
at
her
for
a
while
but
to
refer
to
the
trip
have
you
a
ticket
why
no
i
don
t
think
i
mary
frances
searched
in
her
pockets
and
pulled
out
some
ribbon
a
doll
s
wig
a
thimble
and
a
piece
of
paper
that
s
the
ticket
exclaimed
the
dolphin
pointing
with
his
fin
all
you
need
to
do
is
to
sign
it
have
you
a
pencil
mary
frances
searched
again
in
her
pockets
while
the
dolphin
looked
on
anxiously
but
couldn
t
find
one
well
never
mind
just
pull
out
one
of
my
whiskers
he
said
it
will
write
right
but
i
might
hurt
you
cried
mary
frances
not
if
you
take
that
loose
one
he
said
pointing
with
his
fin
very
gently
mary
frances
pulled
it
and
out
it
came
sign
your
name
cried
the
dolphin
excitedly
right
at
the
end
of
the
paper
excuse
me
said
mary
frances
my
father
says
that
no
one
should
ever
sign
a
paper
without
reading
that
s
good
reading
said
the
dolphin
read
it
and
mary
frances
read
good
for
one
first
class
passage
to
story
island
i
believe
in
all
good
fairies
signed
no
of
course
i
ll
sign
that
said
mary
frances
gravely
using
the
dolphin
s
whisker
at
that
the
dolphin
fell
over
with
a
great
splash
into
the
water
oh
screamed
mary
frances
you
ll
be
drowned
but
just
at
that
moment
up
came
the
dolphin
s
head
out
of
the
water
my
element
he
said
then
mary
frances
laughed
to
think
how
soon
she
had
forgotten
hold
your
ticket
and
wait
right
where
you
are
the
dolphin
called
out
swimming
away
mary
frances
watched
the
splashing
tail
and
shining
back
flashing
in
the
sun
two
or
three
times
he
leaped
playfully
in
the
air
turned
somersaults
in
the
water
and
then
disappeared
from
sight
in
the
little
cove
near
the
mouth
of
the
river
ii
the
good
ferry
puts
out
to
sea
oh
my
thought
mary
frances
oh
my
i
hope
he
won
t
forget
after
a
little
while
she
caught
sight
of
the
dolphin
swimming
around
the
little
high
peninsula
on
one
side
of
the
cove
he
seemed
to
be
piloting
something
for
every
few
seconds
he
would
leap
up
and
look
around
as
if
to
make
sure
that
everything
was
as
it
should
be
soon
mary
frances
saw
a
beautiful
little
sailboat
rounding
the
point
surely
it
was
following
the
dolphin
as
it
drew
nearer
she
could
read
the
name
in
gold
letters
on
the
prow
the
good
ferry
a
brisk
wind
filled
the
white
sails
and
brought
the
boat
so
swiftly
up
the
river
that
the
dolphin
had
to
swim
with
all
his
might
to
keep
ahead
as
she
came
to
anchor
in
the
shallow
water
near
the
bank
the
dolphin
called
out
have
you
your
ticket
yes
answered
mary
frances
holding
it
up
to
view
then
step
on
my
back
and
jump
aboard
said
the
dolphin
as
mary
frances
placed
her
foot
on
the
dolphin
as
on
a
bridge
he
suddenly
arched
his
back
and
tossed
her
aboard
take
plenty
of
time
to
look
the
ship
over
he
called
out
and
don
t
lose
your
ticket
then
the
dolphin
with
the
good
ferry
following
in
his
wake
swam
down
the
river
and
put
out
to
sea
the
good
ferry
was
a
charming
little
boat
graceful
in
every
line
it
wasn
t
any
longer
than
a
large
rowboat
but
it
seemed
to
have
every
comfort
provided
there
was
on
deck
a
comfortable
deck
chair
upon
it
was
spread
a
beautiful
steamer
rug
i
ll
take
a
nice
nap
after
i
look
the
boat
over
thought
mary
frances
as
she
made
her
way
into
the
cabin
she
uttered
a
cry
of
delight
and
no
wonder
any
girl
would
have
loved
it
the
walls
and
woodwork
were
ivory
white
soft
pink
and
light
blue
hangings
fluttered
at
the
windows
a
large
bowl
filled
with
pink
roses
and
turquoise
blue
larkspurs
stood
on
the
little
golden
dressing
table
with
its
folding
mirrors
a
little
princess
dresser
with
its
mirror
stood
across
one
corner
and
an
bed
across
the
other
corner
on
the
and
bed
and
dresser
were
painted
pink
and
blue
flowers
and
the
covers
of
the
table
bed
and
dresser
were
embroidered
with
the
same
designs
there
was
a
wardrobe
in
a
corner
and
in
it
mary
frances
found
the
loveliest
dressing
gown
of
pink
crêpe
de
chine
embroidered
with
sprays
of
light
blue
and
white
daisies
with
yellow
centers
and
pink
roses
and
a
pair
of
light
blue
bedroom
slippers
and
silk
stockings
and
a
boudoir
cap
and
nightgown
and
a
big
steamer
coat
and
cap
all
just
the
right
size
just
like
a
young
lady
she
thought
there
were
two
more
doors
one
led
to
a
pretty
white
bathroom
and
the
other
to
a
little
lined
with
mirrors
i
can
t
get
lonesome
thought
mary
frances
with
so
many
me
s
about
me
and
she
laughed
and
just
as
she
laughed
food
appeared
on
the
table
there
were
chicken
soup
and
celery
and
olives
and
crackers
oh
dear
how
hungry
i
am
she
exclaimed
i
guess
this
is
meant
for
me
and
she
sat
down
on
the
one
chair
at
the
table
and
began
to
eat
the
soup
i
feel
lots
better
said
she
finishing
the
last
drop
it
s
not
good
table
manners
to
tip
this
plate
she
thought
but
i
guess
my
reflections
will
excuse
me
and
she
bowed
to
the
pictures
of
herself
in
the
mirrors
and
laughed
then
suddenly
the
soup
course
disappeared
from
the
table
and
in
its
place
there
were
roast
turkey
and
cranberry
sauce
and
roasted
sweet
potatoes
and
apple
sauce
and
the
many
other
things
which
go
to
make
an
feast
how
wonderful
exclaimed
mary
frances
helping
herself
to
turkey
but
how
stupid
to
eat
by
myself
with
only
myself
for
just
then
she
looked
out
of
the
porthole
window
and
saw
the
dolphin
swimming
ahead
of
the
little
ship
i
ll
go
invite
the
dolphin
to
dinner
she
thought
and
went
on
deck
imagine
her
surprise
to
find
that
there
was
no
land
in
sight
neither
was
there
any
ship
the
only
other
thing
than
the
dolphin
was
the
flying
overhead
hallo
hallo
shouted
mary
frances
making
a
trumpet
of
her
hands
mr
dolphin
dolphin
one
moment
please
the
dolphin
turned
and
looked
at
her
yes
he
asked
raising
one
eyebrow
please
dolphin
do
you
ever
eat
i
am
lonesome
eating
all
i
eat
only
fish
said
the
dolphin
they
are
in
my
element
you
see
i
do
not
find
my
food
out
of
my
oh
as
to
that
replied
mary
frances
i
will
fill
a
bowl
with
your
element
if
you
will
only
accept
the
agreed
said
the
dolphin
swimming
to
the
rope
ladder
hanging
over
the
side
of
the
ship
mary
frances
leaned
down
and
caught
hold
of
his
fins
when
within
reach
and
helped
him
up
when
the
dolphin
reached
the
deck
she
picked
up
a
with
a
rope
attached
threw
it
overside
and
brought
up
a
pail
of
water
then
she
hastened
to
the
and
brought
a
bowl
after
that
she
helped
the
dolphin
to
the
dining
table
the
only
chair
was
clamped
in
place
to
the
floor
just
as
on
any
steamer
and
she
could
not
move
it
so
she
changed
her
place
to
the
side
of
the
table
as
the
chair
was
a
revolving
one
like
a
desk
chair
she
turned
and
turned
it
until
it
reached
the
right
height
for
the
dolphin
she
placed
the
bowl
of
water
element
she
called
it
at
the
dolphin
s
place
illustration
mary
frances
leaned
down
and
caught
hold
of
his
fins
is
there
anything
on
the
table
dolphin
she
asked
which
you
would
like
yes
sighed
the
dolphin
i
would
like
some
more
salt
in
my
element
mary
frances
gravely
shook
the
over
the
bowl
for
a
full
minute
the
dolphin
tasted
the
water
a
little
more
please
he
said
so
mary
frances
emptied
almost
all
the
rest
of
the
salt
out
of
the
shaker
into
the
bowl
the
dolphin
dipped
in
his
head
that
s
excellent
he
said
smacking
his
lips
mercy
thought
mary
frances
i
do
hope
he
won
t
turn
into
a
salt
salt
smackerel
is
my
pet
name
said
the
dolphin
smacking
his
lips
again
and
wiping
them
with
his
fin
i
hardly
dare
think
thought
mary
frances
yet
i
can
t
help
thinking
can
i
what
queer
table
manners
he
has
i
suppose
his
mother
never
taught
him
not
to
smack
his
lips
when
he
eats
just
to
chew
with
the
lips
i
chew
all
i
choose
exclaimed
the
dolphin
my
mother
never
sat
at
a
table
you
oh
said
mary
frances
did
she
stand
three
feet
high
in
her
stocking
feet
solemnly
declared
the
dolphin
which
mary
frances
didn
t
consider
an
answer
at
all
but
was
too
polite
to
say
anything
that
might
be
annoying
to
a
guest
i
wonder
what
i
can
give
him
for
dessert
she
thought
if
you
please
said
the
dolphin
and
mary
frances
noticed
that
he
was
very
pale
if
you
please
i
do
not
care
for
any
you
see
i
have
deserted
my
post
that
is
enough
dessert
for
me
and
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
i
d
be
punished
enough
for
it
in
a
minute
oh
oh
what
is
that
it
s
the
pirate
s
cat
and
with
a
scream
he
leaped
out
of
the
window
into
the
water
iii
the
pirate
s
cat
came
the
cat
s
voice
from
the
door
oh
kitty
kitty
cried
mary
frances
running
toward
it
why
wherever
did
you
come
from
i
thought
i
had
looked
all
over
the
indeed
replied
the
cat
even
if
you
had
and
you
have
not
you
wouldn
t
have
found
me
the
pirate
s
been
watching
a
year
to
throw
me
on
board
the
good
oh
exclaimed
mary
frances
the
pirate
why
i
haven
t
seen
any
pirate
of
course
you
haven
t
said
the
cat
he
s
too
smart
for
that
he
s
been
watching
for
a
time
when
the
dolphin
had
deserted
his
oh
dear
thought
mary
frances
it
was
all
my
fault
but
out
loud
she
said
well
no
great
harm
can
come
of
it
anyway
won
t
you
have
some
dinner
yes
thank
you
said
the
cat
looking
longingly
at
the
table
take
this
chair
invited
mary
frances
pointing
to
the
dolphin
s
place
the
cat
leaped
up
on
the
chair
and
carefully
tucked
a
napkin
into
the
collar
on
its
neck
mary
frances
filled
a
plate
with
turkey
and
potatoes
and
gravy
and
set
it
before
the
cat
who
politely
waited
for
her
to
take
her
place
and
begin
to
eat
do
not
wait
for
me
kitty
said
his
hostess
i
ve
finished
this
course
thank
soon
nothing
was
left
on
the
plate
just
as
mary
frances
was
going
to
suggest
that
ice
cream
might
make
a
nice
dessert
the
cat
began
to
tremble
it
trembled
so
that
the
ship
shook
all
over
why
what
is
the
matter
asked
mary
frances
are
you
chilly
oh
dear
no
replied
the
cat
its
teeth
chattering
oh
dear
no
but
i
forgot
the
pirate
will
hang
me
he
will
he
will
why
will
he
hang
you
asked
mary
frances
quite
bewildered
and
a
little
frightened
speak
softly
said
the
cat
come
here
and
i
ll
and
behind
his
upraised
paw
he
told
the
pirate
ordered
me
to
eat
the
dolphin
and
to
bring
his
right
fin
to
prove
that
i
d
done
it
and
now
i
m
too
full
of
dinner
to
do
eat
him
indeed
said
mary
frances
angrily
i
d
like
to
see
you
oh
would
you
cried
the
cat
if
you
only
hadn
t
given
me
so
much
dinner
you
might
have
had
the
pleasure
that
is
if
the
dolphin
had
come
aboard
again
you
see
i
can
t
do
it
now
i
can
t
catch
him
in
the
water
and
the
pirate
said
he
d
come
for
me
in
an
hour
and
nine
minutes
it
s
close
to
that
now
glancing
at
the
clock
oh
what
shall
i
do
why
does
the
pirate
want
the
dolphin
killed
hush
exclaimed
the
cat
speak
softly
come
here
i
ll
whisper
the
reason
to
you
it
s
on
account
of
the
lost
story
he
thinks
you
might
find
it
and
if
the
dolphin
is
destroyed
he
can
run
down
the
good
ferry
he
can
t
do
the
work
himself
for
he
is
bound
in
chains
on
his
own
ship
but
he
has
prisoners
on
board
whom
he
orders
about
just
as
he
did
me
he
can
t
get
within
miles
of
the
good
ferry
if
the
dolphin
is
guiding
her
he
was
so
mad
that
he
didn
t
notice
when
the
dolphin
first
came
aboard
that
the
foam
from
his
mouth
was
strong
soapsuds
and
washed
the
black
decks
of
the
pirate
ship
snow
but
said
mary
frances
you
forget
if
the
dolphin
guides
the
ship
the
pirate
can
t
get
you
at
that
the
cat
began
to
laugh
joyously
and
it
laughed
so
hard
that
mary
frances
laughed
too
and
suddenly
the
meat
course
disappeared
off
the
table
and
a
huge
block
of
ice
cream
appeared
in
its
place
and
mary
frances
and
the
cat
you
know
what
they
did
iv
the
story
of
the
lost
story
let
s
go
on
deck
said
mary
frances
when
they
had
finished
and
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
more
about
the
lost
story
but
first
you
must
solemnly
promise
that
you
will
not
eat
the
i
solemnly
promise
said
the
cat
with
upraised
paw
very
well
said
mary
frances
leading
the
way
to
the
deck
chair
on
which
she
lay
down
while
the
cat
curled
himself
up
on
a
coil
of
rope
near
her
head
it
happened
in
this
way
began
the
cat
in
a
low
tone
of
voice
as
he
nervously
looked
around
you
know
the
enchanted
island
is
storyland
and
the
home
of
the
story
people
the
story
king
and
queen
have
ruled
there
forever
well
one
day
a
wicked
fellow
who
had
always
said
there
were
no
such
things
as
fairies
somehow
got
into
the
enchanted
island
it
has
always
been
a
mystery
to
me
how
he
did
it
and
stole
a
story
and
carried
it
away
and
hid
it
the
trouble
is
that
no
fairy
is
allowed
to
find
it
the
boy
or
girl
who
takes
it
back
will
be
the
first
person
allowed
to
enter
the
enchanted
island
since
it
was
do
you
know
where
it
is
hidden
asked
mary
frances
i
have
a
slight
idea
whispered
the
cat
is
it
on
board
the
pirate
ship
she
asked
it
can
not
be
i
have
searched
everywhere
everywhere
drowsily
replied
the
cat
mary
frances
noticed
that
his
eyes
were
closing
just
one
thing
more
before
you
go
to
sleep
puss
just
one
thing
more
she
said
do
you
know
how
long
it
will
take
to
reach
the
enchanted
island
and
they
sailed
away
a
year
and
a
day
to
the
land
where
the
palm
tree
grew
murmured
the
cat
and
shake
him
as
she
might
that
was
the
only
answer
mary
frances
could
get
until
at
length
she
could
get
no
answer
at
all
after
she
was
certain
he
was
asleep
she
went
to
the
bow
of
the
boat
and
called
softly
to
the
dolphin
he
swam
up
close
alongside
are
you
all
right
he
asked
i
am
indeed
replied
mary
frances
but
i
want
to
tell
you
what
the
cat
told
me
first
i
want
to
say
that
he
will
not
hurt
you
because
he
is
horribly
afraid
of
the
pirate
and
he
knows
that
he
is
safe
on
the
good
ferry
as
long
as
you
protect
that
s
right
said
the
dolphin
and
now
how
about
the
cat
s
tale
then
mary
frances
told
the
dolphin
the
story
the
cat
had
told
her
why
can
t
we
search
for
it
now
she
asked
well
replied
the
dolphin
i
am
not
exactly
sure
about
the
cat
s
tale
myself
and
every
year
i
take
one
person
direct
to
the
island
that
s
my
orders
that
s
my
orders
none
of
them
have
ever
found
the
lost
story
so
i
ve
taken
them
direct
home
that
s
been
my
orders
that
s
been
my
orders
better
go
on
i
say
better
not
take
anybody
else
s
word
i
say
i
all
right
said
mary
frances
just
as
you
say
but
a
year
s
a
pretty
long
that
depends
replied
the
dolphin
a
year
is
queer
if
it
s
full
of
fear
a
year
s
a
day
if
it
s
full
of
play
and
i
ve
heard
say
a
year
will
leap
if
you
re
sound
and
away
it
swam
and
then
mary
frances
noticed
that
the
sky
was
getting
dark
and
she
realized
that
she
was
very
sleepy
she
made
her
way
to
the
white
cabin
and
undressed
and
went
to
bed
wearing
the
pretty
clothing
which
she
found
in
the
wardrobe
if
i
waken
suddenly
and
want
to
go
on
deck
i
ll
have
on
my
negligee
she
thought
as
she
tied
the
dressing
gown
in
place
and
slipped
on
the
boudoir
cap
v
land
ahoy
mary
frances
awoke
with
a
start
and
rubbed
her
eyes
surely
i
heard
somebody
call
she
said
again
came
the
call
land
ahoy
land
ahoy
why
that
is
what
they
called
out
on
columbus
ship
when
they
discovered
america
thought
mary
frances
hurriedly
dressing
i
wonder
if
we
are
discovering
it
was
just
getting
light
as
she
ran
out
on
deck
at
first
she
did
not
see
any
living
thing
except
the
dolphin
which
was
swimming
ahead
of
the
boat
she
gazed
around
on
the
water
it
was
a
deep
blue
color
it
looks
like
the
tub
of
bluing
water
when
nora
rinses
the
clothes
she
thought
i
wonder
if
it
will
color
anything
she
ran
to
the
railing
dipped
up
a
pailful
and
dropped
in
her
handkerchief
just
clear
water
she
said
and
hung
it
up
to
dry
land
ahoy
came
the
call
once
more
mary
frances
looked
up
at
the
sails
there
was
the
cat
he
was
sitting
on
the
rope
ladder
and
holding
his
forepaws
like
a
telescope
as
soon
as
he
saw
mary
frances
he
pointed
ahead
and
shouted
land
ahoy
then
she
saw
a
dim
outline
of
coast
the
cat
scrambled
down
the
rigging
and
ran
up
to
her
story
island
see
he
said
why
exclaimed
mary
frances
why
how
long
have
i
been
asleep
i
thought
you
said
something
about
a
year
ha
ha
laughed
the
cat
a
year
and
a
day
i
said
and
that
it
nearly
is
you
have
been
asleep
just
three
hundred
and
days
and
some
have
i
really
exclaimed
mary
frances
then
hearing
a
sudden
splash
in
the
water
oh
what
was
that
was
it
the
pirate
that
that
wasn
t
anything
to
be
afraid
of
just
some
flying
fish
answered
the
cat
do
they
really
have
wings
asked
mary
frances
they
certainly
do
come
let
us
look
into
the
water
and
see
if
there
are
any
near
the
boat
said
the
cat
oh
oh
oh
exclaimed
mary
frances
what
a
beautiful
fish
i
see
it
has
a
tail
of
gold
and
a
head
of
blue
turquoise
blue
isn
t
it
beautiful
see
it
there
yes
i
do
said
the
cat
it
is
an
angel
an
angel
fish
that
s
just
the
right
name
for
it
said
mary
frances
yes
i
believe
somebody
who
tasted
one
named
it
that
said
the
cat
surely
nobody
would
eat
such
a
beautiful
creature
mary
frances
said
the
cat
smiled
its
beauty
is
more
than
skin
deep
he
said
well
i
wouldn
t
eat
anything
so
lovely
said
mary
frances
that
reminds
me
of
a
rhyme
a
fish
taught
me
said
the
cat
that
sounds
mighty
fishy
thought
mary
frances
but
she
did
not
say
anything
shall
i
say
it
for
you
and
without
waiting
to
hear
he
went
on
oh
mother
if
you
lived
down
in
the
sea
and
a
fish
you
had
to
be
what
kind
of
fish
would
be
your
wish
my
own
would
be
an
angel
fish
with
nose
of

angelic

of

fish
said
mary

running
to
the

side
of
the
boat
and
mary
frances
saw
the
long
fountain
of
water
shooting
up
in
the
air
my
said
the
cat
if

feed
every
hungry
cat
i

why
how
big
is
it
asked
mary
frances
it
s
twenty
times
as
long
as
half
again
and
double
the
quarter
wide
said
the
cat
how
large
is
that
if
you
please
asked
mary
frances
if
the
length
is
multiplied
by
the
thickness
and
then
by
breadth
it
will
give
the
correct
volume
said
the
cat
at
least
that
s
according
to
tickle
asked
mary
frances
what
is

for

not
like
to

said
the

and

the

leading
the
way
to
the
middle
of
the
deck
he
lifted
a
wooden
cover
underneath
was
a
deep
box
the
bottom
of
the

was
made
of
glass

gazing
down
into
the
clear
water
through
the
glass
the
cat
laughed
they
are
not
trees
he
said
they
are
coral
formations
and
he
told
her
about
the
tiny
coral
insects
which
build
coral
growth
by
fastening
their
tiny
shell
bodies
to
each
other
do

asked
mary
frances
oh

the
cat
they
just
grow
naturally
like
any
other
babies
sometimes
they
make
forms
or
did
they
build
the
white
houses
over
on
the
island
asked
mary
frances
of
course
not
said
the
cat
what
a
curious
question
they
live
only
in
the
sea
the
houses
are
up
in
the
air
but
they
built
the
not
that
big
island
exclaimed
mary

not

your
pardon

mary
frances
very
humbly
will
you

dug
out
of

cellars

went
on

hint
and
went
into
the
cabin
she
tidied

and
when

the
voice
of
the

that

this
instant
unless

she
turned
almost
as

her
two

she
waved
an
oar
at
the
boat
then
mary

saw
that
all
around
the
island
was
stretched
an
curtain

the
old
witch
it
s
so

looked
at

mary

call
the
the
dolphin

up
at
that
moment
whither
now
it
asked
where

cat
said
the
cat
and
the
dolphin
swam
ahead
turned
the
boat
and
soon
the
island
was
out
of
sight
come
i
am
hungry
said
mary
frances
let
us
go
into
the
the
dolphin
has
plenty
of
element
soup
she
thought
there
was
the
table
spread
with
a
fine
feast
and
both
she
and
the
cat
enjoyed
it
just
as
they
were
finishing
dessert
they
heard
a
pounding
noise
they
rushed
out
on
deck
the
noise
was
made
by
the
dolphin
hitting
the
side
of
the
boat
with
its
tail
it
whispered
two
words
pirate
ship
and
swam
ahead
again
the
cat
made
a
telescope
with
his
paws
and
looked
out
over
the
water
sure
enough
he
cried
in
fear
oh
my
oh
my
and
i
haven
t
eaten
the
dolphin
for
shame
exclaimed
mary
frances
for
shame
you
have
forgotten
that
he
can
t
come
very
near
while
the
dolphin
is
at
his
post
oh
yes
that
is
so
excuse
me
please
but
what
does
the
pirate
mean
by
coming
i
wonder
do
you
suppose
he
thinks
we
may
be
near
finding
the
story
asked
mary
frances
that
s
it
exclaimed
the
cat
i
ll
wager
my
whiskers
that
s
his
idea
so
that
if
we
espy
it
he
ll
get
it
do
you
think
we
ll
find
it
asked
mary
frances
my
fur
feels
as
though
we
would
said
the
cat
please
tell
me
is
it
sending
out
sparks
it
was
growing
quite
late
in
the
afternoon
and
quite
dusky
mary
frances
to
her
astonishment
saw
great
showers
of
electric
sparks
coming
from
the
cat
s
body
you
look
like
a
sparkler
on
the
fourth
of
july
cat
she
said
oh
isn
t
that
fine
said
the
cat
you
see
it
s
this
way
the
nearer
we
get
to
the
story
the
more
sparklier
my
fur
so
we
must
be
quite
near
said
mary
frances
for
i
don
t
see
how
you
could
get
much
more
i
forgot
to
tell
you
said
the
cat
that
after
we
find
the
story
the
dolphin
s
power
to
keep
the
pirate
away
is
gone
we
ll
have
to
race
like
a
rocket
to
beat
his
oh
my
what
is
the
matter
exclaimed
mary
frances
as
the
cat
suddenly
jumped
high
in
the
air
sending
out
a
shower
of
sparks
that
fell
at
her
feet
on
the
deck
over
the
side
of
the
boat
he
fell
and
all
was
dark
as
a
pocket
oh
kitty
kitty
cried
the
frightened
girl
running
to
look
into
the
water
but
she
saw
nothing
of
the
cat
neither
could
she
see
the
dolphin
she
could
see
the
dim
light
of
the
pirate
s
ship
and
it
seemed
quite
near
whatever
shall
i
do
thought
mary
frances
i
really
believe
i
am
going
to
just
at
that
minute
she
heard
a
scratching
on
the
side
of
the
good
ferry
who
s
there
she
whispered
illustration
she
fed
him
a
little
at
a
time
with
a
medicine
dropper
no
answer
came
just
another
scratching
who
s
there
she
asked
again
came
a
faint
voice
mary
frances
could
see
better
now
for
her
eyes
were
getting
accustomed
to
the
darkness
is
it
you
puss
she
asked
peering
down
into
the
water
when
she
saw
it
was
the
cat
she
quickly
let
down
the
rope
ladder
and
the
cat
climbed
aboard
and
fell
in
a
wet
heap
at
her
feet
she
lifted
him
carefully
and
carried
him
to
the
steamer
chair
she
did
not
notice
that
something
dropped
from
his
mouth
as
she
lifted
him
she
dried
his
wet
fur
and
went
to
the
to
get
him
a
drink
of
water
there
she
saw
a
bowl
of
beef
tea
which
she
took
to
him
she
fed
him
a
little
at
a
time
with
a
medicine
dropper
which
she
had
found
in
the
bathroom
at
length
he
opened
his
eyes
where
is
it
he
asked
where
is
what
asked
mary
frances
the
lost
story
whispered
the
cat
i
carried
it
in
my
mouth
that
is
why
i
couldn
t
answer
you
when
you
asked
who
was
i
didn
t
see
it
said
mary
frances
oh
dear
oh
dear
exclaimed
the
cat
it
must
be
on
deck
let
us
look
for
it
you
are
not
able
yet
said
mary
frances
lie
still
i
will
look
was
it
a
roll
or
a
book
it
was
a
glass
bottle
said
the
cat
and
it
may
have
rolled
back
into
the
sea
if
that
is
what
you
mean
by
was
it
a
roll
mary
frances
went
down
on
her
hands
and
knees
she
crept
all
over
the
deck
feeling
for
it
in
the
darkness
after
a
while
the
cat
helped
they
worked
all
night
but
could
find
nothing
in
the
morning
as
it
grew
light
they
both
saw
a
dark
green
bottle
caught
in
the
top
of
the
rope
ladder
which
was
fastened
to
the
side
of
the
boat
so
lightly
was
the
bottle
held
that
it
might
easily
have
fallen
back
into
the
water
and
been
lost
again
mary
frances
lifted
it
carefully
it
was
labeled
the
lost
story
the
bottle
was
sealed
with
a
cork
and
inside
was
a
roll
of
paper
oh
isn
t
it
too
good
to
be
true
exclaimed
mary
frances
where
shall
we
hide
it
let
s
label
it
catsup
and
put
it
on
the
side
table
in
the
said
the
cat
put
the
new
label
right
over
the
old
one
he
added
that
s
a
splendid
idea
cried
mary
frances
i
ll
do
it
right
away
viii
the
pirate
chases
the
good
ferry
when
mary
frances
came
on
deck
again
the
good
ferry
was
plowing
the
water
so
fast
that
a
deep
furrow
of
foam
followed
her
the
dolphin
was
swimming
so
fast
that
it
made
deep
waves
with
the
motion
of
its
tail
although
going
so
rapidly
they
could
see
that
the
pirate
s
black
ship
was
keeping
the
distance
the
same
as
at
first
between
them
i
believe
he
is
gaining
at
length
said
the
cat
who
was
using
his
paws
for
a
telescope
mary
frances
looked
a
little
pale
but
smiled
i
think
we
will
make
more
time
in
a
minute
she
said
let
s
drop
something
overboard
and
he
may
stop
to
pick
it
so
they
filled
a
suitcase
with
paper
and
dropped
it
over
the
side
they
were
delighted
when
they
saw
the
pirate
s
ship
stop
to
pick
it
up
they
could
hear
the
loud
ravings
of
the
pirate
when
he
found
nothing
inside
the
rest
of
the
trip
was
very
exciting
for
the
pirate
s
ship
at
one
time
was
so
close
that
they
heard
the
pirate
say
to
the
cook
blast
ye
blast
ye
why
don
t
ye
jump
aboard
ye
can
make
it
in
two
jumps
jump
yourself
replied
the
cook
faster
and
faster
swam
the
dolphin
faster
and
faster
sailed
the
good
ferry
try
as
he
would
the
pirate
could
not
overtake
them
they
saw
him
plainly
half
a
knot
behind
jumping
up
and
down
on
his
deck
shaking
his
angry
fists
as
they
reached
the
island
he
turned
and
gave
up
the
chase
in
defeat
when
they
came
to
the
wharf
there
stood
the
old
witch
drinking
ink
out
of
a
bottle
ha
ha
she
honked
ye
think
ye
ve
got
the
lost
do
ye
well
ye
haven
t
there
then
she
began
to
wave
her
arms
about
her
head
laughing
wildly
as
mary
frances
stepped
off
the
boat
the
old
witch
tried
to
snatch
the
story
bottle
out
of
her
hand
oh
you
can
t
scare
me
said
mary
frances
step
aside
please
and
as
she
pushed
past
the
wild
old
witch
the
great
curtain
fell
with
a
crash
and
before
her
was
fairyland
or
storyland
which
as
you
know
are
one
and
the
same
ix
the
terrible
punishment
of
the
pirate
and
the
old
witch
mary
frances
heard
music
and
singing
she
heard
the
words
who

the
bravest
in
this
land
she
who
holds
in
her
right
hand
the
long
lost
precious
story

the
bravest
in

land
then
mary

and
stepped
forward
with
the
story

was

by
a
beautiful
young
lady
who
introduced
herself
as
the
story

and
a
small
company
of

said
mary

handing
him
the
bottle
if

into

room
all
wound
up
in
a
great
section
of
the

he
was
dreadfully
pale
and
very
angry
his
mouth
was
frothing
and
his
breath
was
coming
out
of
his
nostrils
like
smoke
he
glowered
at
mary
frances
as
though
he
would
like
to
bite
her
but
she
was
not
afraid
behave
said
the
king
you
can
not
frighten
a
person
who
has
been
so
brave
as
to
part
the
curtain
if
she
had
been
afraid
of
the
old
witch
the
curtain
would
not
have
parted
and
all
the
children
in
the
world
would
have
been
still
waiting
for
new
he
turned
to
the

on
hearing
his
fate
the
pirate
screamed
anything

he
fell
down
in
a
dead
faint
blue
beard
dragged
him
out
immediately
after
the
king
ordered
the
old
witch
in

the

the
old

on
his

i
it
from
him
and
put
it
in
a
bottle
and

going
to
bring
it
back
but
i
lost
it
overboard
in
a
i
didn
t
want
the
pirate
to
know
i
took
it
for
he
would
have
beaten
me
to
why
did
you
try
to
take
it
from
this
young
lady
asked
the
queen
the
old
witch

because
i
wanted
to

story
declared
the
queen
to
the
middle
of
a
story

then
the
old
witch
gave
a
loud
shriek
and
ran
out
of
the
room
as
fast
as
she
could
the
king
sent
a
giant
after
her
and
had
him

both
the
pirate
and
the
old
witch
up
in
big
iron
baskets
and
carry
them
off
to
the
end
of
snowwhere
and
now
my
dear
said
the
king
what

to
be
our
dear
little
friend

reward

rewards
shall
be
hers
replied
the
queen

the
children
of

other
is
that

the
stories

wishes
to
very
good
said
the
king
let
us
now
hear
the
lost
and
all
the
story
people
sat
down
to
form
a
double
circle
with
that
the
story
lady
dressed
like
a
butterfly
came
dancing
in
the
king
opened
the
green
bottle
took
out
the
roll
of
paper
and
handed
it
to
her
she
took
her
place
at
the
end
just
where
the
circle
closed
and
began
to
read
aloud
the
lost
story
which
is
entitled
the
bubble
x
the
bubble
story
lilla
walked
through
the
garden
saying
i
should
like
to
be
a
princess
for
she
had
been
reading
a
story
about
a
princess
who
had
only
to
say
come
and
anything
she
wished
for
came
at
once
it
was
a
hot
summer
day
and
she
sat
down
on
a
mossy
bank
under
an
elm
tree
thinking
what
she
should
wish
for
if
she
had
the
power
of
the
princess
all
at
once
the
garden
seemed
strange
to
her
and
she
heard
a
voice
saying
if
you
take
a
rose
from
me
you
will
then
a
princess
she
looked
up
and
saw
an
aster
growing
in
a
green
which
she
had
never
seen
before
and
on
one
of
the
flowers
was
perched
a
tiny
fairy
and
you
can
have
everything
you
can
wish
for
except
one
thing
if
you
wish
for
that
you
will
lose
the
and
what
is
that
asked
lilla
taking
the
rose
which
the
fairy
offered
her
you
must
never
ask
for
soap
oh
soap
bubbles
of
course
i
shall
not
wish
for
them
said
lilla
whenever
you
want
anything
said
the
fairy
just
say
rose
rose
bring
to
me
everything
i
wish
to
you
will
be
a
princess
as
long
as
you
keep
the
rose
but
you
must
never
ask
for
soap
bubbles
now
i
must
go
back
to
my
so
the
fairy
went
to
fairyland
and
lilla
went
home
but
no
one
knew
her
because
she
was
now
a
princess
with
long
hair
and
a
golden
crown
i
will
go
up
to
the
castle
on
the
hill
thought
lilla
princesses
go
there
to
at
the
castle
they
were
expecting
a
princess
so
they
thought
lilla
must
be
the
one
who
was
coming
and
they
gave
her
a
grand
room
all
hung
with
velvet
curtains
to
sleep
in
on
the
table
was
a
silver
box
which
lilla
thought
just
right
to
keep
her
rose
in
now
i
shall
try
what
i
can
do
with
my
rose
thought
lilla
so
she
thought
of
a
box
of
toys
and
said
rose
rose
bring
to
me
everything
i
wish
to
scarcely
had
she
spoken
when
a
maid
came
to
say
that
a
box
had
come
for
her
when
the
box
was
opened
lilla
saw
so
many
pretty
things
that
she
thought
she
would
like
a
christmas
tree
to
hang
them
on
and
again
she
said
rose
rose
bring
to
me
everything
i
wish
to
and
in
a
few
minutes
a
christmas
tree
arrived
hung
all
over
with
gold
and
silver
drops
and
colored
lights
and
bonbons
and
still
more
bonbons
and
gifts
of
all
kinds
the
people
at
the
castle
had
never
seen
such
a
beautiful
christmas
tree
and
they
were
delighted
with
the
gifts
which
lilla
divided
among
them
day
after
day
lilla
asked
her
rose
for
something
new
and
every
day
more
and
more
beautiful
things
came
till
not
only
her
own
room
but
the
whole
castle
was
full
of
them
she
gave
them
away
to
every
one
for
she
soon
grew
tired
of
them
illustration
on
one
of
the
flowers
was
perched
a
tiny
fairy
every
day
she
was
trying
to
think
of
something
she
did
not
have
but
at
last
there
seemed
nothing
left
to
wish
for
that
was
when
she
began
to
long
for
soap
bubbles
which
were
the
only
things
she
must
not
have
but
how
beautiful
thousands
of
soap
bubbles
would
look
floating
about
in
the
sunshine
with
rainbow
colors
upon
them
she
thought
she
could
think
of
nothing
else
and
grew
quite
sad
because
she
could
not
ask
for
soap
bubbles
so
one
day
she
went
into
the
garden
taking
her
rose
with
her
shall
i
ask
or
shall
i
not
she
kept
thinking
but
she
could
not
make
up
her
mind
so
she
counted
on
the
buttons
of
her
dress
yes
no
yes
no
yes
no
my
mother
told
me
to
say
yes
oh
dear
sighed
lilla
i
wanted
it
to
come
yes
i
am
going
to
ask
for
them
so
she
said
the
magic
rhyme
rose
rose
bring
to
me
everything
i
wish
to
but
no
soap
bubbles
came
she
looked
all
around
the
garden
even
up
in
the
branches
of
the
trees
but
no
bubbles
were
to
be
seen
then
she
grew
impatient
she
took
the
rose
and
said
rose
rose
bring
to
me
everything
i
wish
to
then
suddenly
the
air
was
filled
with
soap
bubbles
little
ones
big
ones
floated
all
over
the
garden
oh
aren
t
they
lovely
cried
lilla
holding
out
her
arms
to
catch
some
and
then
a
bubble
larger
than
the
others
opened
and
closed
around
the
golden
rose
and
lifted
it
out
of
her
hand
floated
quickly
away
with
it
higher
higher
higher
until
lilla
could
no
longer
see
it
she
watched
and
watched
until
only
two
soap
bubbles
were
to
be
seen
then
she
sank
on
her
knees
and
stretched
out
her
hands
after
them
but
it
was
too
late
her
rose
was
gone
the
bubbles
were
gone
and
she
was
no
longer
a
princess
her
hair
was
as
short
as
it
ever
had
been
and
her
crown
had
disappeared
it
was
of
no
use
to
return
to
the
castle
now
as
the
people
would
not
know
her
where
should
she
go
what
could
she
do
she
was
so
worried
that
she
cried
aloud
and
you
can
imagine
how
glad
she
was
to
hear
her
own
mother
s
voice
saying
lilla
dear
you
must
have
fallen
asleep
come
wake
up
tell
mother
about
your
why
mother
it
was
just
like
a
story
said
lilla
sitting
up
and
rubbing
her
eyes
then
she
told
her
mother
all
about
it
a
very
pretty
story
said
her
mother
and
one
that
shows
you
that
people
who
can
have
almost
everything
they
wish
for
are
not
really
happier
than
others
there
is
always
something
just
out
of
their
reach
and
that
makes
them
discontented
with
what
they
yes
even
soap
bubbles
said
lilla
laughing
that
s
a
good
story
too
good
to
be
lost
said
the
story
king
when
the
story
lady
finished
yes
but
we
have
better
and
you
shall
hear
some
of
them
said
the
story
queen
to
mary
frances
smiling
graciously
then
to
the
people
she
announced
there
will
be
a
reception
in
the
court
of
honor
this
evening
to
our
visitor
mary
frances
the
finder
of
the
lost
story
as
it
is
now
dark
let
every
one
retire
and
then
all
the
people
applauded
formed
in
line
and
marched
out
each
bowing
to
the
king
queen
and
mary
frances
who
stood
rather
timidly
in
her
place
with
the
story
lady
beside
her
after
the
others
were
gone
the
story
lady
turned
to
her
and
said
the
queen

planned
for
you
to
be
in
my
charge
during
your
visit
and
all
you
wish
to
see
or

your

kind
and
how
perfectly
lovely
exclaimed
mary
frances
clapping
her
hands
i
couldn
t
possibly
wish
for
anything
i
would
rather
have
than
to
be
with
you
this
pleased
the
story
lady
greatly
and
she
led
the
way
to
their
apartments
i
wish
i
had
the
time
and
space
to
tell
you
more
about
the
wonderful
and
delightful
reception
how
mary
frances
stood
in
line
with
the
king
and
queen
and
was
introduced
to
all
the
people
of
the
island
as
a
distinguished
visitor
whose
deed
would
never
be
forgotten
as
long
as
stories
were
told
but
if
i
were
to
relate
all
they
said
and
did
this
book
would
not
hold
of
the
stories
which
the
story
lady
had
planned
for
mary
frances
to
hear
the
revels
continued
far
into
the
night
and
when
at
last
they
ended
mary
frances
retired
to
her
apartment
excited
and
happy
as
the
story
lady
kissed
her
she
said

the
first

the
first

and
the
the
red
two
tiny
s
adventures
in
more
adventures
stories
told
the
first
day
xi
mischievous
anna
and
peter
now
you
must
know
that
the
story
people
met
at
a
certain
hour
every
day
to
hear
and
to
tell
stories
new
and
old
for
as
you
may
well
believe
it
is
no
small
task
to
provide
stories
enough
to
feed
the
children
of
the
world
accordingly
when
all
were
assembled
the
story
king
in
his
place
and
mary
frances
in
the
seat
of
honor
beside
the
story
queen
the
story
lady
began
to
tell
the
story
of
mischievous
anna
and
peter
anna
and
peter
were
always
in
mischief
one
day
they
climbed
to
the
top
of
a
high
wall
it
was
a
fairy
wall
and
it
grew
higher
and
higher
until
at
last
it
went
so
high
that
they
got
frightened
for
they
did
not
know
how
they
should
get
down
again
so
they
held
tight
by
each
other
and
the
wall
and
began
to
cry
but
no
one
heard
them
for
they
were
far
away
from
home
besides
they
were
as
high
up
in
the
air
as
the
top
of
a
mountain
oh
oh
oh
sobbed
anna
oh
oh
oh
sobbed
peter
and
their
eyes
were
red
and
their
faces
quite
wet
and
dirty
i
shall
fall
said
peter
i
can
t
hold
on
much
longer
said
anna
and
then
they
both
sobbed
oh
oh
oh
again
then
they
heard
a
voice
saying
oh
oh
oh
after
them
only
it
was
not
any
one
crying
for
the
oh
oh
oh
had
a
very
sweet
sound
they
could
not
look
round
for
they
dared
not
move
their
heads
and
they
dared
not
look
down
for
fear
of
getting
dizzy
but
the
voice
seemed
to
be
coming
nearer
and
so
it
was
for
a
fairy
gate
with
a
tree
beside
it
and
a
little
bit
of
ground
to
stand
upon
was
shooting
up
into
the
air
just
as
the
wall
had
done
and
when
it
was
as
high
as
the
wall
it
stopped
and
peter
and
anna
saw
that
a
boy
was
leaning
against
the
gate
he
was
playing
on
a
and
that
made
the
sound
they
had
heard
i
will
play
you
a
tune
said
the
boy
and
he
played
so
softly
and
sweetly
that
peter
and
anna
left
off
crying
how
did
you
come
up
asked
anna
on
the
gate
said
the
boy
how
are
you

down
asked
peter
on
the
gate
to
be
sure
said
the
boy
i
have
only
to
say

me
go
far
down
to
the
earth
and
as
he
said
the
words
down
he
went
let
us
also
try
said
anna
wall
wall
let
us
go
far
down
to
the
earth
then
down
went
the
wall
to
the
ground
and
peter
and
anna
slid
off
and
stood
staring
at
the
boy
who
was
still
playing
on
his
pipe
what
do
you
want
most
asked
the
boy
my
pipe

ask
a
silk
frock
with
a
flounce
and
a

fond
of
fine
clothes

new
suit
and
pair
of
leather
reins
to
play
at
horses
with

peter
the
boy
played
a
lively
tune
and
before
anna
could
say
ready
she
found
herself
dressed
in
a
fine
new
frock
while
peter
had
the
reins
in
his
hands
and
a
new
suit
of
clothes
with
a
great
frill
and
a
round
hat
illustration
they
were
as
high
up
in
the
air
as
the
top
of
a
mountain
then
the
boy
said
and
peter
and
anna
went
towards
home

will
go
this
way
said
peter
i
will

said
anna
so
they
parted
anna
as
she
walked
along
heard
little
feet
behind
her
and
when
she
reached
the
steps
leading
to
her
home
she
looked
round
and
what
was
her
surprise
when
she
saw
a
large
mouse
dressed
like
a
lady
with
a
parasol
in
its
hand

countess
mouse

the
mouse

and
she
said

we
have
a
large
cat
that

mary
frances
said
thank
you
for
telling
me
that
story
i
i
wish
would
you
like
to
hear
another
about
isabella
and
her
cruel
stepsisters
asked
the
story
lady
i
should
love
to
hear
it
replied
mary
frances
the
story
people
smiled
and
nodded
and
the
story
lady
proceeded
xii
diamonds
and
toads
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
dear
little
girl
named
isabella
she
lived
with
her
father
and
her
stepmother
and
her
two
stepsisters
isabella
was
a
pretty
child
and
had
sweet
manners
her
stepsisters
were
not
pretty
and
they
and
their
mother
were
jealous
of
isabella
they
seldom
spoke
kindly
to
her
they
made
her
do
the
hard
work
of
the
home
and
treated
her
in
a
harsh
manner
very
much
as
cinderella
s
stepmother
and
stepsisters
treated
cinderella
one
of
her
hard
duties
was
to
fetch
the
water
for
the
household
from
the
well
just
outside
the
village
it
was
quite
a
long
walk
to
the
well
and
after
isabella
had
worked
all
the
morning
cooking
and
washing
the
dishes
and
washing
and
ironing
or
sweeping
she
felt
sometimes
that
she
was
too
tired
to
go
so
far
and
carry
home
such
a
heavy
load
one
day
after
washing
and
ironing
she
said
i
wish
one
of
you
girls
would
go
with
me
to
the
well
and
help
me
bring
back
the
water
i
am
so
indeed
they
shall
not
exclaimed
her
stepmother
angrily
what
do
you
think
that
my
daughters
shall
wait
on
you
i
do
not
care
to
get
tanned
in
the
sun
yawned
one
i
do
not
wish
my
hands
to
look
as
though
i
work
said
the
other
haughtily
so
isabella
set
out
alone
she
sat
down
to
rest
several
times
on
her
way
but
after
a
while
she
reached
the
well
it
was
an
affair
and
had
a
bucket
on
a
long
chain
which
wound
on
a
roller
it
was
not
hard
work
to
drop
the
bucket
down
the
well
but
it
was
hard
work
to
turn
the
handle
of
the
roller
until
the
dripping
bucket
reached
the
top
it
was
still
harder
work
to
empty
the
bucket
into
the
pail
she
carried
this
day
when
isabella
came
to
the
well
there
was
an
old
woman
sitting
on
the
she
was
a
old
woman
she
wore
an
old
shawl
about
her
head
and
shoulders
when
she
saw
isabella
she
said
little
good
morning
said
the
little
girl
how
do
you
do
i
should
do
very
well
thank
you
said
the
old
woman
if
i
had
a
drink
of
that
you
shall
soon
have
said
isabella
forgetting
her
own
tiredness
because
she
felt
sorry
for
her
isabella
soon
had
the
well
bucket
up
filled
her
pail
and
then
held
it
so
that
the
thirsty
woman
could
drink
out
of
the
side
she
drank
long
and
eagerly
thank
you
she
said
at
length
dear
child
you
will
never
be
sorry
for
your
kindness
and
she
rose
and
walked
away
isabella
threw
away
the
rest
of
the
water
and
after
refilling
her
pail
set
out
for
home
when
she
reached
the
house
her
stepmother
said
you
are
late
where
have
you
been
isabella
opened
her
mouth
to
answer
and
what
do
you
think
happened
out
fell
diamonds
and
roses
quickly
the
stepmother
called
her
daughters
and
they
began
to
sweep
them
up
where
have
you
been
cried
the
stepsisters
what
has
happened
to
you
isabella
tried
to
think
what
could
have
brought
such
a
thing
about
for
she
was
as
much
surprised
as
any
of
them
but
she
could
not
think
of
anything
unusual
except
the
meeting
with
the
old
woman
speak
demanded
her
stepmother
are
you
trying
to
hide
something
from
us
illustration
she
drank
long
and
eagerly
isabella
said
that
she
had
met
a
strange
old
lady
at
the
well
but
that
she
could
not
remember
anything
else
that
had
not
happened
every
time
she
had
gone
for
water
every
once
in
a
while
as
she
was
speaking
diamonds
and
roses
fell
from
her
mouth
you
need
not
go
for
the
water
the
next
time
said
her
stepmother
i
shall
send
my
own
the
next
day
the
two
stepsisters
went
to
fetch
the
water
when
they
came
to
the
well
there
sat
the
old
ragged
woman
on
the
curb
young
maidens
said
the
old
woman
the
stepsisters
just
stared
at
her
my
it
is
a
warm
day
said
the
old
woman
and
i
am
very
thirsty
will
you
give
me
a
drink
of
water
indeed
we
will
not
said
the
older
one
haughtily
the
very
idea
exclaimed
the
younger
one
looking
at
the
old
woman
s
ragged
clothes
i
should
think
not
then
they
drew
the
water
all
the
time
complaining
and
groaning
about
the
hard
work
when
they
started
to
go
home
the
old
woman
spoke
you
are
not
kind
she
said
you
will
be
but
they
only
laughed
and
hurried
away
their
mother
met
them
at
the
door
well
my
dears
she
said
how
fared
you
did
you
meet
any
good
fortune
all
we
saw
was
an
old
woman
at
the
well
such
a
ragged
wretched
old
thing
she
was
too
answered
one
girl
and
she
wanted
us
to
give
her
a
drink
of
water
the
idea
the
other
girl
said
at
the
same
time
with
the
last
words
out
of
their
mouths
fell
several
snakes
and
toads
which
went
scudding
across
the
floor
their
mother
screamed
and
gathering
her
skirts
about
her
jumped
on
a
chair
oh
where
have
you
been
she
cried
what
has
happened
to
you
and
when
the
girls
told
her
that
they
did
not
know
more
snakes
and
toads
fell
from
their
mouths
this
is
an
outrage
exclaimed
their
mother
isabella
has
formed
some
terrible
plot
against
you
she
is
to
blame
go
bring
her
here
and
i
shall
punish
her
i
shall
whip
her
until
she
tells
us
the
charm
she
has
the
girls
ran
out
and
soon
came
back
dragging
isabella
between
them
just
as
they
reached
their
mother
a
bright
light
appeared
in
the
room
and
suddenly
a
beautiful
fairy
stood
before
them
do
not
touch
isabella
she
said
to
the
stepmother
she
is
not
in
the
least
to
blame
for
your
children
s
misfortune
their
cruel
fate
is
their
own
fault
when
i
met
isabella
at
the
well
and
asked
her
for
a
drink
of
water
she
gave
it
to
me
gladly
and
willingly
but
when
i
met
your
daughters
and
asked
them
for
a
drink
they
treated
me
proudly
and
you
exclaimed
the
stepmother
looking
upon
the
radiant
creature
with
her
shining
fairy
robes
about
her
met
you
and
would
not
give
you
a
drink
of
water
the
fairy
smiled
ah
yes
it
was
i
but
i
did
not
look
then
as
i
now
do
i
was
the
ragged
old
woman
at
the
if
they
had
known
it
was
you
said
the
stepmother
if
they
had
known
it
was
i
the
fairy
said
how
could
i
have
judged
whether
they
were
kind
of
heart
and
polite
to
old
people
and
helpful
to
people
in
need
when
i
met
isabella
the
fairy
went
on
i
looked
just
as
when
i
met
your
daughters
and
she
was
very
polite
and
kind
to
me
and
gave
me
a
drink
holding
the
pail
while
i
drank
even
though
she
was
very
tired
because
only
polite
and
kind
words
came
from
her
mouth
i
gave
her
a
good
fairy
gift
and
because
only
impolite
and
unkind
words
came
from
the
mouths
of
your
daughters
i
gave
them
another
kind
of
oh
please
take
back
the
one
you
gave
them
pleaded
the
mother
do
you
mean
isabella
s
gift
too
asked
the
fairy
oh
no
the
mother
said
let
her
have
her
gift
but
please
please
take
away
the
awful
gift
of
my
daughters
let
me
see
said
the
fairy
what
isabella
says
about
that
shall
i
take
back
the
gift
of
your
stepsisters
my
dear
oh
please
please
do
cried
isabella
i
am
so
sorry
that
they
are
very
well
then
said
the
fairy
for
isabella
s
sake
i
shall
take
their
gifts
back
but
only
on
one
condition
that
they
promise
to
be
kind
and
polite
from
now
oh
we
promise
we
promise
cried
both
stepsisters
at
once
unless
you
keep
your
promise
said
the
fairy
the
snakes
and
toads
will
come
from
your
mouths
and
the
fairy
disappeared
as
suddenly
as
she
had
come
but
the
snakes
and
toads
did
not
come
again
for
the
stepsisters
and
their
mother
were
very
kind
to
every
one
ever
after
and
isabella
lived
a
happy
life
from
that
day
they
just
had
to
keep
their
promise
didn
t
they
commented
mary
frances
i
am
glad
they
did
for
i
do
not
like
people
to
break
neither
do
i
agreed
the
story
lady
and
that
reminds
me
of
one
of
our
favorite
stories
coralie
and
the
magic
oh
said
mary
frances
but
i
like
a
story
with
magic
in
very
well
said
the
story
lady
i
will
tell
you
the
xiii
the
magic
necklace
once
there
was
a
girl
whose
name
was
coralie
she
was
a
very
pretty
girl
and
very
clever
she
was
so
bright
in
her
lessons
at
school
that
all
she
needed
to
do
was
to
read
them
over
once
and
she
knew
them
she
lived
in
a
pretty
home
and
was
a
great
pet
her
parents
loved
her
dearly
and
although
they
were
not
well
off
they
gave
coralie
everything
she
wished
for
that
they
could
afford
so
you
see
she
had
all
the
comforts
of
life
if
not
the
luxuries
you
would
think
she
would
have
been
a
very
happy
child
wouldn
t
you
well
she
would
have
been
if
she
had
not
had
one
very
dreadful
fault
sometimes
she
told
only
half
the
truth
sometimes
she
told
only
quarter
the
truth
sometimes
she
stretched
the
truth
so
far
that
she
broke
it
her
parents
did
everything
they
could
to
cure
her
of
her
dreadful
fault
but
everything
failed
even
being
in
her
room
for
a
whole
day
with
only
bread
and
butter
and
milk
did
not
help
her
at
last
they
became
almost
desperate
one
evening
after
coralie
had
gone
to
bed
her
father
said
there
is
only
one
thing
left
i
suppose
we
must
take
coralie
to
the
magician
yes
replied
her
mother
with
a
sigh
it
is
the
only
thing
i
can
think
of
you
need
not
go
dear
husband
for
it
will
mean
the
loss
of
several
days
work
i
will
take
her
myself
we
can
start
so
in
the
morning
her
mother
and
coralie
set
out
on
their
journey
now
the
enchanter
merlin
knew
untruthful
people
even
a
long
way
off
he
could
tell
them
by
their
odor
so
as
coralie
and
her
mother
drew
near
his
palace
which
was
built
of
frosted
glass
he
threw
some
incense
on
the
fire
to
keep
himself
from
becoming
at
length
coralie
s
mother
rang
the
door
bell
and
merlin
himself
came
to
the
door
good
afternoon
he
said
good
afternoon
replied
coralie
s
mother
we
have
come
a
long
distance
to
see
you
sir
because
merlin
raised
his
hand
i
know
all
about
the
reason
he
said
you
have
come
to
see
me
because
you
can
not
make
your
daughter
tell
the
truth
she
is
one
of
the
most
untruthful
children
that
ever
lived
i
know
because
her
lies
often
make
me
ill
when
i
smelled
her
coming
i
had
to
burn
incense
and
he
frowned
terribly
you
can
imagine
how
this
frightened
coralie
she
hid
behind
her
mother
her
mother
seemed
frightened
too
oh
sir
she
begged
please
deal
as
gently
with
her
as
you
can
we
love
her
so
dearly
we
are
so
grieved
that
we
can
not
cure
her
our
own
do
not
fear
answered
the
magician
i
am
not
going
to
hurt
her
all
that
i
wish
to
do
is
to
make
her
a
so
he
invited
them
into
the
palace
and
led
the
way
to
his
workroom
all
the
woodwork
in
the
room
was
light
green
the
windows
were
studded
with
red
and
blue
and
green
jewels
and
they
threw
rainbow
colors
on
the
floor
merlin
went
to
a
golden
table
and
opening
a
drawer
took
out
a
beautiful
amethyst
necklace
with
a
diamond
clasp
he
threw
the
necklace
around
coralie
s
neck
that
is
all
he
said
to
her
mother
you
may
go
i
am
going
to
lend
my
magic
necklace
of
truth
to
coralie
i
shall
come
for
it
in
one
then
he
turned
to
coralie
and
said
do
not
take
it
off
if
you
do
great
harm
may
come
to
you
and
he
clapped
his
hands
twice
illustration
he
threw
the
necklace
around
coralie
s
neck
two
slaves
appeared
and
after
bowing
before
merlin
showed
coralie
and
her
mother
to
the
door
coralie
of
course
was
delighted
with
the
necklace
all
her
life
long
she
had
wished
for
jewelry
but
her
parents
could
not
afford
to
get
her
anything
but
the
pretty
seal
ring
which
she
wore
as
to
getting
such
a
necklace
as
merlin
had
given
her
it
would
have
taken
everything
they
owned
in
the
world
to
so
much
as
buy
the
diamond
clasp
when
she
went
back
to
school
the
girls
all
gathered
about
her
and
began
to
admire
the
necklace
isn
t
it
beautiful
they
exclaimed
what
a
lucky
girl
your
people
must
have
fallen
heirs
to
a
fortune
isn
t
it
pretty
said
coralie
lifting
the
sparkling
string
for
them
to
see
better
yes
my
father
and
mother
gave
it
to
me
you
see
i
have
been
ill
and
they
were
so
glad
when
i
got
well
that
they
gave
me
this
for
a
oh
oh
oh
cried
the
girls
and
no
wonder
they
did
for
all
the
sparkle
left
the
necklace
and
it
looked
dull
and
old
and
scratched
what
is
the
matter
asked
coralie
don
t
you
think
my
parents
could
give
it
to
me
they
bought
it
and
paid
an
immense
sum
for
at
that
falsehood
the
necklace
turned
from
the
light
purple
amethyst
color
to
a
dull
gray
agate
and
the
diamond
clasp
to
a
shade
then
coralie
saw
what
had
happened
and
she
was
frightened
no
she
said
they
did
not
give
it
to
me
we
went
to
the
magician
merlin
and
he
lent
it
to
at
these
truthful
words
the
necklace
became
as
beautiful
as
ever
but
the
children
began
to
laugh
what
are
you
laughing
at
asked
coralie
you
needn
t
make
fun
merlin
was
very
glad
to
see
us
when
he
saw
us
in
the
distance
he
sent
his
carriage
to
meet
us
it
was
drawn
by
two
horses
and
the
coachman
wore
livery
there
was
a
great
feast
spread
for
us
and
each
of
us
had
a
servant
in
back
of
our
chairs
we
had
golden
plates
to
eat
from
and
suddenly
coralie
stopped
speaking
for
the
children
were
laughing
at
her
harder
than
ever
she
looked
down
at
her
necklace
no
wonder
they
laughed
it
was
dull
again
in
color
and
had
grown
so
long
it
rested
upon
the
ground
ho
ho
coralie
cried
one
come
now
you
are
stretching
the
truth
set
us
right
well
confessed
coralie
merlin
didn
t
send
any
one
to
meet
us
we
walked
and
we
were
in
his
palace
only
a
little
at
these
words
the
necklace
shrank
to
its
right
size
and
resumed
its
own
beautiful
color
but
now
coralie
cried
the
children
but
now
tell
us
truly
where
you
got
the
necklace
did
the
magician
give
it
to
you
yes
said
coralie
he
just
handed
it
to
me
without
saying
a
word
i
think
he
she
did
not
finish
the
sentence
for
the
necklace
had
suddenly
grown
so
tight
that
it
was
choking
her
and
she
was
gasping
for
breath
come
come
coralie
cried
one
of
the
girls
you
are
keeping
back
part
of
the
truth
tell
the
truth
what
happened
he
said
i
was
one
of
the
most
untruthful
persons
in
the
world
admitted
coralie
and
the
necklace
became
itself
again
and
so
things
kept
on
every
time
coralie
tried
to
say
one
untruthful
thing
the
necklace
behaved
in
some
queer
frightful
way
even
the
children
became
sorry
for
her
for
she
began
to
look
worried
all
the
time
if
i
were
you
i
d
take
the
necklace
back
one
of
the
girls
told
her
it
gives
you
no
happiness
at
indeed
it
doesn
t
said
coralie
i
wish
i
why
don
t
you
take
it
back
the
girl
asked
now
coralie
did
not
wish
to
tell
her
and
kept
still
for
she
was
wondering
what
she
could
possibly
say
but
the
necklace
began
to
act
wildly
the
stones
began
to
dance
up
and
down
so
hard
that
they
hurt
her
merlin
told
me
i
must
not
take
it
off
she
said
if
i
should
do
so
great
harm
would
come
to
me
he
is
coming
for
it
when
i
ve
worn
it
for
a
and
the
necklace
shone
just
a
little
more
brightly
than
before
and
the
diamond
clasp
sparkled
so
that
it
would
have
dazzled
your
eyes
to
look
at
it
and
after
that
coralie
began
to
lose
the
worried
look
for
the
telling
of
the
truth
was
beginning
to
be
a
habit
with
her
the
necklace
very
seldom
had
to
remind
her
for
every
day
it
grew
easier
for
her
to
tell
the
truth
and
when
merlin
came
for
his
necklace
he
brought
her
a
far
more
beautiful
gift
than
the
necklace
but
it
was
one
that
she
could
not
wear
showily
it
was
a
necklace
of
pearls
pearls
of
great
price
which
she
wore
just
over
her
heart
you
see
merlin
needed
his
magic
necklace
for
another
child
who
did
not
tell
the
truth
nobody
knows
where
the
magic
necklace
is
but
if
i
were
a
child
in
the
habit
of
telling
falsehoods
i
should
not
feel
quite
sure
that
it
would
not
be
found
again
will
it
asked
mary
frances
as
the
story
lady
finished
the
story
it
may
be
said
the
story
king
i
have
an
idea
where
it
is
why
do
you
know
any
children
who
do
not
speak
the
truth
i
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
i
do
mary
frances
said
i
do
not
know
many
though
i
know
two
who
do
not
always
tell
the
truth
and
i
know
one
child
who
isn
t
kind
to
her
pet
cat
i
wish
i
knew
a
story
to
tell
her
when
i
go
all
right
perhaps
you
would
like
to
hear
the
story
of
please
tell
it
to
me
she
asked
so
the
story
lady
told
the
story
of
the
cat
and
the
xiv
the
cat
and
the
carrots
linda
was
a
little
girl
who
rarely
thought
of
any
one
but
herself
she
would
take
the
warmest
place
by
the
fire
and
the
largest
piece
of
cake
on
the
dish
or
the
finest
apple
or
pear
and
she
would
take
away
the
toys
from
the
other
children
and
did
not
care
for
anything
as
long
as
she
was
amused
herself
her
mother
was
very
sorry
to
see
that
linda
was
selfish
and
used
to
talk
very
seriously
to
her
about
it
and
to
tell
her
that
no
one
would
love
her
if
she
did
not
mend
her
ways
but
linda
did
not
care
and
she
did
not
believe
what
her
mother
said
you
will
always
love
me
mother
said
she
perhaps
so
said
her
mother
but
then
you
are
my
own
little
girl
and
it
is
my
duty
to
take
care
of
you
besides
i
shall
be
very
sorry
for
you
because
you
will
be
very
unhappy
but
no
one
else
will
care
for
you
every
one
will
dislike
you
because
you
are
selfish
every
one
in
the
linda
did
not
say
anything
but
the
words
every
one
in
the
world
came
into
her
head
many
times
during
the
day
and
at
night
they
came
into
her
dreams
and
she
fancied
she
saw
the
words
written
in
letters
of
fire
from
which
the
flames
shot
up
in
all
directions
and
she
was
saying
half
aloud
the
bed
will
be
on
fire
when
a
voice
said
but
you
are
not
in
bed
you
are
in
the
then
she
looked
round
and
saw
that
she
was
near
the
barn
and
that
there
was
a
ladder
not
far
off
and
a
great
barrel
close
by
also
there
was
a
heap
of
carrots
which
linda
began
to
toss
about
and
to
snap
in
two
and
to
pull
the
leaves
off
and
at
last
she
was
throwing
them
all
into
the
when
a
voice
suddenly
said
stop
linda
looked
round
but
no
one
was
to
be
seen
stop
said
the
voice
again
then
linda
looked
down
and
seated
upon
a
stone
she
saw
a
carrot
whose
green
of
leaves
she
had
broken
off
two
little
legs
and
two
little
arms
had
sprouted
out
and
it
had
eyes
and
a
mouth
but
no
nose
have
you
no
feelings
said
the
carrot
is
it
not
enough
to
be
taken
from
my
home
in
the
earth
without
being
knocked
about
and
flung
into
a
how
would
you
like
it
i
m
not
a
carrot
said
linda
you
don
t
care
for
any
one
but
yourself
replied
the
carrot
growing
redder
and
redder
no
one
likes
you
not
even
carrots
and
you
will
find
that
some
day
people
will
pay
you
back
for
being
so
selfish
i
am
going
to
begin
at
once
come
carrots
carrots
carrots
he
shouted
in
and
out
whirl
about
pinch
and
beat
her
let
her
know
selfishness
will
bring
her
woe
come
at
once
and
greet
then
suddenly
all
the
carrots
that
were
lying
about
sprang
up
and
those
that
were
in
the
sprang
out
of
it
they
were
joined
by
those
in
the
gardens
near
and
they
came
trooping
along
like
an
army
they
could
walk
as
well
in
the
air
as
on
the
ground
and
they
whirled
around
linda
and
pulled
her
hair
and
pinched
her
arms
till
she
cried
aloud
for
mercy
ho
ho
ho
only
see
what
it
is
our
foe
to
be
shouted
the
carrots
as
they
twirled
up
and
down
and
round
and
round
illustration
have
you
no
feelings
said
the
carrot
the
air
was
full
of
carrots
and
the
ground
was
covered
by
them
and
linda
made
up
her
mind
that
if
she
ever
got
clear
of
them
she
would
never
meddle
with
a
carrot
again
as
long
as
she
lived
she
kept
off
their
blows
as
long
as
she
could
but
at
last
she
was
too
tired
to
do
so
any
longer
and
she
sank
down
to
the
ground
crying
oh
please
leave
off
please
leave
off
we
now
have
done
but
we
ve
had
some
fun
said
the
carrot
who
had
first
spoken
to
her
carrots
depart
said
he
waving
his
hand
the
last
carrot
had
said
but
linda
had
not
spoken
she
waited
till
she
thought
he
had
gone
and
then
she
looked
up
the
carrot
certainly
was
not
there
but
a
large
cat
was
sitting
beside
her
topsy
poor
topsy
said
linda
but
topsy
put
up
her
back
and
her
eyes
looked
very
fierce
poor
topsy
indeed
said
the
cat
angrily
don
t
think
to
coax
me
you
never
think
of
me
in
the
house
you
pull
my
whiskers
and
my
tail
and
you
never
give
me
a
bit
of
meat
or
anything
nice
that
you
are
eating
and
this
morning
though
i
sat
on
the
chair
beside
you
longing
for
a
little
new
milk
you
drank
it
all
up
you
did
not
leave
me
a
drop
you
are
the
most
selfish
little
girl
i
know
and
i
don
t
like
you
so
i
am
going
to
scratch
oh
dear
oh
dear
said
linda
please
don
t
the
carrots
have
punished
me
till
i
am
quite
cats
cats
one
and
all
tabby
come
when
i
call
gray
and
yellow
black
and
white
cats
and
kittens
come
hither
called
the
cat
loudly
ah
all
the
cats
and
kittens
in
the
world
must
have
come
so
many
and
they
all
thronged
round
her
and
sat
upon
her
shoulders
and
clung
round
her
arms
all
the
cats
in
the
world
hate
you
said
topsy
we
do
we
do
we
do
mewed
the
cats
she
never
cares
what
becomes
of
poor
cats
and
then
the
cats
tumbled
over
each
other
and
tumbled
over
linda
and
crowded
round
her
and
upon
her
until
she
was
sitting
under
a
heap
of
cats
with
only
her
face
peeping
out
and
topsy
was
crouching
in
front
looking
fiercely
at
her
now
that
you
can
not
stir
said
topsy
i
am
going
to
scratch
oh
oh
oh
shrieked
linda
and
she
gave
such
a
start
that
all
the
cats
fell
down
upon
the
ground
and
at
that
moment
she
opened
her
eyes
and
found
herself
in
her
bed
with
her
mother
standing
beside
her
what
is
the
matter
asked
her
mother
for
she
had
heard
linda
scream
oh
oh
oh
sobbed
linda
i
have
had
such
a
horrid
well
it
was
only
a
dream
you
are
awake
now
and
i
am
with
every
one
in
the
world
hates
me
even
the
cats
and
the
carrots
sobbed
linda
and
bit
by
bit
she
told
her
mother
all
her
dream
it
was
such
a
horrid
dream
and
i
was
so
frightened
said
linda
i
can
t
think
why
it
i
will
tell
you
said
her
mother
it
came
out
of
your
own
heart
you
had
been
thinking
of
the
words
i
said
to
you
that
every
one
would
dislike
you
but
myself
i
am
glad
that
you
have
had
this
dream
for
it
shows
me
that
my
words
have
sunk
into
my
little
girl
s
heart
and
i
hope
now
that
she
will
try
to
i
will
try
said
linda
and
she
did
try
and
whenever
she
was
inclined
to
do
any
selfish
act
she
thought
of
her
wonderful
dream
and
said
to
herself
i
should
not
wish
all
the
world
to
be
like
the
cats
and
the
that
s
a
good
story
said
mary
frances
to
the
queen
i
shall
try
to
remember
it
is
a
good
story
replied
the
queen
smiling
but
we
have
still
better
as
you
shall
here
a
page
boy
who
sat
on
a
stool
at
the
foot
of
the
story
lady
began
to
fidget
as
if
to
ask
a
question
well
what
is
it
roland
asked
the
story
lady
if
you
please
can
t
we
have
a
story
about
a
boy
answered
roland
yes
said
the
story
lady
you
shall
have
two
stories
one
about
a
tiger
and
the
other
about
a
page
boy
who
killed
a
xv
the
brahmin
the
tiger
and
the
jackal
once
upon
a
time
a
brahmin
who
was
walking
along
the
road
came
upon
an
iron
cage
in
which
some
men
had
shut
up
a
great
tiger
as
the
brahmin
passed
by
the
tiger
called
out
o
brother
brahmin
brother
brahmin
have
pity
on
me
and
let
me
out
for
only
one
minute
i
am
so
thirsty
i
shall
die
unless
i
can
have
a
drink
of
i
am
afraid
said
the
brahmin
that
if
i
let
you
out
you
will
eat
no
indeed
said
the
tiger
as
soon
as
i
have
had
some
water
i
will
go
back
to
my
then
the
brahmin
was
sorry
for
the
thirsty
beast
and
opened
the
cage
door
instantly
the
tiger
jumped
out
and
cried
i
will
eat
you
first
and
drink
the
water
do
not
be
in
such
a
hurry
said
the
brahmin
let
us
ask
the
opinions
of
six
and
if
they
all
say
it
is
fair
for
you
to
kill
me
then
i
am
willing
to
very
well
said
the
tiger
we
will
ask
the
first
six
living
things
we
so
they
walked
on
till
they
came
to
a
and
the
brahmin
said
hear
and
let
me
hear
said
the
this
tiger
said
the
brahmin
begged
me
to
let
him
out
of
his
cage
to
drink
a
little
water
and
he
promised
not
to
hurt
me
now
that
he
is
free
he
wishes
to
eat
me
is
it
fair
that
he
should
do
so
then
the
said
men
come
to
rest
in
my
cool
shade
when
they
have
rested
they
break
my
branches
and
scatter
my
leaves
they
are
a
cruel
race
let
the
tiger
eat
the
tiger
tiger
said
the
brahmin
do
not
eat
me
yet
you
said
that
you
would
hear
the
judgment
of
very
well
said
the
tiger
and
they
went
on
their
way
soon
they
met
a
camel
camel
camel
cried
the
brahmin
hear
and
let
me
hear
said
the
camel
then
the
brahmin
told
his
story
when
i
was
young
and
strong
and
could
work
my
master
took
good
care
of
me
said
the
camel
but
now
that
i
am
old
he
starves
me
and
beats
me
without
mercy
men
are
a
cruel
race
let
the
tiger
eat
the
the
tiger
would
have
killed
the
brahmin
then
and
there
but
he
said
tiger
tiger
do
not
eat
me
yet
you
said
that
you
would
hear
the
judgment
of
very
well
said
the
tiger
and
they
went

way

they

an
ox
lying
near
the
road
brother
ox

cried
the
brahmin

and
let
me

said
the
ox
and
the
brahmin
told
his
story
when
i
was
young
said
the
ox
my
master
was
kind
to
me
now
that
i
am
too
old
to
work
he
has
left
me
here
to
die
men

a
cruel
race

tiger
eat
the
they
next
saw
an
eagle
flying
through
the
air
and
the
brahmin
cried
o
eagle
great
eagle
hear
and
let
me
hear
said
the
eagle
the
brahmin
told
his
story
and
the
eagle
said
whenever
men
see
me
they
try
to
shoot
me
they
climb
the
rocks
to
my
nest
and
steal
away
my
little
ones
men
are
a
cruel
race
let
the
tiger

the
then
the
tiger
began
to
roar
but
the
brahmin
said
wait
we
have
yet
two
to
soon
they
saw
an
alligator
and
the
brahmin
told
his
story
but
the
alligator
said
whenever
i
put
my
nose
out
of
the
water
men
torment
me
they
are
a
cruel
race
let
the
tiger
eat
the
the
brahmin
was
now
in
despair
but
the
tiger
was
willing
to
keep
his
word
and
the
sixth
judge
was
a
jackal
now
the
jackal
is
a
miserable
little
beast
whom
no
one
likes
but
he
listened
to
the
brahmin
s
story
you
must
show
me
just
where
it
was
and
how
it
happened
said
the
jackal
so
they
all
went
back
to
the
cage
i
was
here
said
the
brahmin
standing
in
the
road
and
i
was
in
the
cage
said
the
tiger
which
way
were
you
looking
said
the
jackal
and
show
me
the
side
of
the
cage
where
you
i
was
on
this
side
said
the
tiger
jumping
into
the
cage
oh
yes
i
see
said
the
jackal
and
was
the
cage
door
shut
shut
and
bolted
said
the
brahmin
then
shut
and
bolt
it
said
the
jackal
when
the
brahmin
had
done
this
the
jackal
said
o
wicked
and
ungrateful
tiger
you
would
have
killed
the
good
brahmin
who
opened
your
cage
door
your
cruelty
shall
be
punished
for
no
one
will
ever
let
you
out
again
go
your
way
friend
brahmin
and
go
in
good
for
the
jackal
said
roland
clapping
his
hands
now
for
the
dragon
so
the
story
lady
went
right
on
xvi
the
red
dragon
there
lived
in
a
marsh
near
a
certain
village
a
red
dragon
which
terrorized
all
the
people
round
about
so
the
king
of
the
country
offered
a
great
reward
to
any
one
who
would
kill
the
frightful
beast
a
great
many
knights
of
the
king
s
army
went
out
one
after
the
other
to
slay
it
and
each
came
back
with
a
wonderful
tale
of
how
he
had
fought
with
the
dragon
and
after
wounding
it
had
given
up
the
fight
only
for
fear
of
being
slain
by
the
monster
never
mind
you
will
have
better
success
next
time
the
kind
king
would
say
to
each
defeated
knight
then
he
would
give
him
a
valuable
gift
as
a
reward
for
his
brave
effort
there
was
among
the
king
s
pages
a
little
boy
who
was
a
great
butterfly
hunter
the
king
s
librarian
paid
him
a
gold
piece
for
every
new
butterfly
he
found
this
page
was
a
great
favorite
of
the
king
and
often
rode
with
him
on
long
journeys
one
day
when
the
king
stopped
in
the
neighborhood
in
which
the
dragon
lived
the
page
boy
slipped
off
with
his
net
to
hunt
butterflies
and
in
chasing
a
rare
specimen
lost
his
way
and
wandered
into
the
very
swamp
where
the
dragon
was
roaming
about
when
the
fierce
old
dragon
saw
the
boy
he
came
rushing
and
roaring
at
him
in
a
great
rage
the
frightened
boy
looked
around
there
were
no
trees
to
climb
for
safety
and
he
knew
that
if
he
ran
he
could
not
escape
for
run
as
he
might
the
dragon
could
run
still
faster
illustration
wow
shrieked
the
dragon
he
had
nothing
with
which
to
fight
except
his
butterfly
net
the
net
was
fastened
to
the
end
of
a
long
stout
stick
and
the
boy
decided
to
defend
himself
with
this
as
best
he
could
when
the
monster
charged
down
upon
him
bellowing
fearfully
he
raised
his
stick
and
thrust
it
with
all
his
might
into
the
bulging
side
of
the
beast
wow
shrieked
the
dragon
and
with
a
puff
it
went
up
in
the
air
and
burst
just
as
a
balloon
does
when
a
hole
is
slashed
in
its
cover
the
fierce
old
dragon
was
nothing
but
skin
and
air
when
he
was
sure
it
was
quite
dead
the
boy
grasped
the
empty
dragon
skin
by
its
spiked
tail
and
dragged
it
back
to
the
castle
and
showed
it
to
the
king
he
was
the
maddest
king
you
ever
heard
of
when
he
saw
the
dead
dragon
lying
there
and
sent
off
at
once
for
the
bold
knights
who
had
pretended
to
fight
it
so
bravely
you
old
humbugs
he
cried
there
lies
the
red
dragon
you
bragged
so
much
about
fighting
it
wasn
t
a
thing
but
skin
and
air
if
any
one
of
you
had
so
much
as
touched
it
with
the
point
of
a
sword
it
would
have
gone
to
pieces
as
it
did
when
my
brave
page
boy
struck
it
with
his
butterfly
the
cowardly
knights
had
no
word
to
say
so
the
king
ordered
them
to
give
the
gifts
they
had
received
for
fighting
the
dragon
to
the
page
boy
who
was
then
so
rich
that
he
was
able
to
buy
a
castle
of
his
own
when
he
grew
up
he
was
known
as
one
of
the
bravest
knights
of
that
country
xvii
two
poems
the
page
was
pretty
brave
said
roland
when
i
was
little
i
used
to
be
scared
of
the
dark
and
my
mother
taught
me
a
poem
about
being
oh
say
it
for
us
please
cried
a
girl
near
him
the
boy
shook
his
head
in
refusal
but
mary
frances
gave
him
a
smile
and
said
encouragingly
please
i
want
to
hear
then
roland
rose
made
a
bow
and
recited
his
poem
if
i
could
crow
sometimes
i
waken
up
at
night
and
can
not
see
a
speck
of
light
i
snuggle
down
into
my
bed
and
pull
the
clothes
in
overhead
i
look
and
peer
into
the
dark
as
something
seems
to
whisper
hark
then
with
an
awful
sudden
jump
my
heart
begins
to
thump
and
thump
oh
my
i
think
i
ll
be
so
brave
and
all
my
courage
try
to
save
then
as
i
feel
my
courage
go
our
yellow
rooster
starts
to
crow
then
i
m
ashamed
and
feel
so
small
to
think
that
i
m
not
brave
at
all
to
know
that
in
the
black
black
night
our
rooster
crows
no
soul
in
sight
he
flaps
his
wings
and
crows
for
fair
his
voice
sounds
like
he
didn
t
care
oh
well
what
if
i
m
scared
i
know
i
d
be
brave
too
if
i
could
crow
just
at
this
point
the
cat
came
bouncing
into
their
midst
i
have
just
time
enough
he
said
breathlessly

made
a
bow

his
whiskers
and
began
the
twins

two
little
kittens
a
black
and

looked
at
the

a
moment
with

wee
heads
yellow
and
brown

then
to
grandmother
soberly
said

going
to
drown
a
author
unknown
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
he
waltzed
around
three
times
turned
a
somersault
and
bounded
out
of
the
circle
as
quickly
as
he
had
appeared
when
the
story
people
had
stopped
laughing
the
story
king
rose
and
waved
his
hand
and
said
that

mary
frances

said
the
queen
smiling
at
her
enthusiasm
well
you
shall
have
a
delightful
surprise
while
the
stories
were
being
told
mary
frances
had
noticed
a
little
man
sitting
at
a
table
near
the
story
lady
and
writing
rapidly
with
an
immense
quill
pen
before
him
was
a
pile
of
white
paper
and
an
inkwell
as
she
told
the
story
he
wrote
it
down
keeping
even
pace
with
her
words
mary
frances
had
never
seen
any
one
write
so
fast
and
she
watched
him
fascinated
almost
without
an
effort
his
pen
flew
over
the
paper
and
as
the
last
word
of
the
story
left
the
story
lady
s
lips
his
pen
stopped
then
he
folded
his
papers
neatly
and
laid
them
on
the
table
as
mary
frances
was
passing
out
with
the
story
lady
this
little
man
much
to
her
surprise
stepped
up
and
handed
her
the
papers
he
had
been
writing
these
said
he
are
your
copies
of
the
stories
you
have
just
oh

she
replied
hesitating
to

them

the

the
ready
writer

mary
frances
again
to
the
ready
writer
how
fast

must
be
the
fastest
writer
in
the
world
the
little
man
bowed
and
retired
evidently
much
pleased
with
her
praise
of
his
skill
xviii
tiny
s
adventures
in
tinytown
before
it
grows
dark
i
have
something
to
show
you
one
of
the
most
interesting
sights
on
story
island
said
the
story
lady
but
we
must
hasten
because
darkness
falls
here
very
suddenly
it
drops
like
a
curtain
all
at
together
they
walked
down
the
castle
steps
and
through
the
town
all
was
so
strange
to
mary
frances
the
houses
the
streets
everything
was
so
or
and
yet
so
familiar
that
it
seemed
as
if
she
had
seen
them
all
before
you
live
in
story
land
indeed
said
mary
frances
gazing
eagerly
about
her
yes
returned
the
story
lady
we
are
not
a
very
soon
they
came
to
a
beautiful
park
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
this
is
the
queen
s
garden
said
the
story
lady
here
are
many
of
the
trees
flowers
and
birds
you
read
about
in
the
story
oh
oh
cried
mary
frances
with
delight
as
she
looked
about
her
many
of
the
wonders
were
strange
but
here
and
there
others
were
familiar
and
she
lingered
to
examine
them
not
too
long
warned
the
story
lady
smiling
or
darkness
will
overtake
us
here
is
a
surprise
for
they
came
to
an
enclosure
surrounded
by
a
white
about
a
foot
high
what
a
tiny
little
town
cried
mary
frances
looking
down
yes
that
is
what
we
call
it
why
it
s
just
like
the
towns
at
home
said
mary
frances
looking
closer
there
s
the
school
and
the
the
public
square
and
the
fountain
the
church
the
the
stores
and
houses
just
as
they
are
at
home
oh
where
did
you
get
it
we
found
it
in
your
country
replied
the
story
lady
and
we
brought
it
here
and
set
it
up
just
as
you
see
it
and
named
it
after
tiny
the
girl
who
discovered
it
but
it
s
a
long
oh
won
t
you
tell
me
the
story
yes
this
mary
frances
walked
all
around
the
fence
and
examined
the
little
town
minutely
to
think
of
finding
that
on
story
island
she
exclaimed
at
the
same
time
she
felt
a
little
pang
of
homesickness
but
said
nothing
about
it
now
we
must
hasten
home
said
the
story
lady
as
it
was
broad
daylight
mary
frances
thought
it
rather
strange
to
hurry
so
but
just
as
they
reached
the
castle
darkness
fell
and
the
daylight
went
just
as
if
some
one
had
pressed
a
button
and
shut
it
out
that
evening
while
they
were
resting
comfortably
in
their
apartments
the
story
lady
related
tiny
s
adventures
in
tinytown
just
as
they
are
set
down
here
gets
tiny
was
out
in
the
woods
hunting
chestnuts
when
a
bird
flew
overhead
a
bird
tiny
saw
the
bird
twice
before
she
was
certain
it
was
a
flicker
at
first
it
seemed
like
a
golden
streak
of
yellow
as
it
flew
by
but
when
it
rested
on
a
low
bush
she
felt
sure
there
wasn
t
any
yellow
about
it
instead
it
was
and
brown
on
its
head
was
the
most
beautiful
crescent
of
red
its
throat
was
a
warm
specked
with
of
black
illustration
just
at
her
feet
lay
the
tiniest
little
bit
of
a
town
strange
thought
tiny
tiptoeing
nearer
and
nearer
oh
no
it
s
not
strange
at
all
why
it
s
a
flicker
a
woodpecker
its
wings
are
lined
with
yellow
of
course
it
looked
like
a
yellow
bird
when
flying
wick
wick
wick
wick
follow
the
bird
flew
on
a
little
farther
i
will
catch
up
soon
birdie
tiny
called
and
hurried
to
the
branch
where
the
bird
was
sitting
wick
wick
on
and
on
it
flew
tiny
following
when
suddenly
it
disappeared
entirely
and
there
was
tiny
miles
out
in
the
forest
and
not
knowing
the
way
back
home
at
all
and
not
a
single
thing
to
eat
either
my
now
i
am
scared
but
i
won
t
cry
i
m
nine
years
old
and
i
won
t
cry
i
ll
look
around
and
see
if
there
isn
t
something
i
can
think
to
do
but
a
big
tear
blinded
her
eye
where
s
my
handkerchief
where
ever
did
i
put
my
handkerchief
she
looked
in
her
pocket
but
if
i
m
not
going
to
cry
what
do
i
need
it
for
she
asked
herself
and
brushed
away
a
big
drop
with
the
back
of
her
hand
oh
oh
look
tiny
laughed
so
that
the
woods
echoed
and
no
wonder
she
did
for
just
at
her
feet
lay
the
tiniest
little
bit
of
a
town
with
real
houses
no
bigger
than
real
people
too
not
much
taller
than
pins
real
no
bigger
than
pencils
real
carts
no
bigger
than
peanuts
real
horses
no
bigger
than
katydids
in
the
center
of
the
town
was
a
lovely
little
fountain
from
the
fountain
walks
led
in
four
directions
houses
and
public
buildings
were
along
these
walks
and
scattered
on
the
green
lawns
were
pretty
oh
what
a
lovely
cottage
cried
tiny
spying
a
beautiful
little
house
near
the
edge
of
the
village
i
m
going
to
pick
it
up
no
i
ll
stoop
down
and
look
at
it
people
may
be
inside
if
i
picked
it
up
they
might
be
hurt
and
she
leaned
over
and
examined
it
closely
but
was
careful
not
to
step
into
the
town
the
walls
were
covered
with
vines
and
geraniums
bloomed
at
the
windows
charming
white
curtains
hung
on
the
sashes
showing
off
the
brilliant
color
of
the
geraniums
smoke
was
coming
out
of
the
chimney
my
the
people
who
live
in
that
cottage
must
be
getting
supper
the
little
girl
spoke
softly
to
herself
it
seems
to
me
i
can
smell
it
cooking
what
tiny
little
bits
of
dishes
they
must
use
smaller
than
the
littlest
ones
i
own
why
an
acorn
would
be
almost
large
enough
for
a
bath
tub
for
the
tiny
laughed
gayly
at
the
idea
i
ll
wait
here
for
a
minute
or
two
to
see
if
anybody
comes
out
of
the
door
she
said
taking
a
seat
on
the
twisted
roots
of
a
nearby
tree
but
although
she
waited
patiently
for
several
minutes
no
one
appeared
how
i
wonder
who
lives
in
such
a
dear
little
home
she
thought
it
must
be
fun
to
live
in
such
a
beautiful
little
house
my
isn
t
the
whole
town
too
sweet
for
anything
how
i
d
like
to
live
there
she
put
her
toe
on
the
gravel
walk
which
led
across
the
tiny
little
town
and
in
a
second
she
was
no
longer
a
big
girl
she
was
as
little
as
a
pin
herself
only
of
course
not
so
thin
as
a
pin
but
just
the
right
size
for
the
house
is
put
in
the
tiny

her
tiny
little
eyes
with
her
tiny
little
hand
and
looked
about
her
in
amazement
she
was
very
near
the
cottage
she
had
so
much
admired
i
d
love
to
peep
in

would
be
so

a
and
a
little
monkey
tiny
put
her
hand
in
her
pocket
to
find
a
penny
but
all
she
found
there
were
three
chestnuts
each
no
bigger
than
a
period
poor
little
monkey
said
tiny
as
he
came
up
to
her
lifting
his
hat
you
must
be
tired
i
wonder
if

d
like
these
the
monkey
smelled
of
the
nuts

his
hat

at
his
master
and
nodding
his
thanks
began
to
eat
them
he
no

rest
of
the
day

smiled
the
man
and
passed
down
the
street
my
thought
tiny
as
she
walked
along
i

had
taken
some
money
with
me
this
morning
if
i
had
a
nickel

d
buy
some
bananas

s
i
certainly

s
inquired
the
man
as
she
stood
looking
at
his
wares
tiny
nodded
i
haven
t
any
money
she
said
trying
to
keep
from
crying
never

smiled
the
man
i

she
die
i

s
he
handed
her
a
bananas
no
bigger
than

points
oh

said
tiny
i
ll
never
forget
how
kind
you
but
the
man
was
on
his
way
down
the
street
before
she
finished
she
felt
much
better
after
eating
and
stood
for
quite
a
while
watching
the
little
fountain
play
and
splash
away
in
the
distance
she
heard
a
dog
bark
and
at
the
edge
of
the
village
she
saw
a
tiny
newsboy
and
with
him
a
tiny
dog
no
bigger
than
a
capital
letter
under
his
arm
he
carried
tiny
newspapers
no
bigger
than
postage
stamps
not
much
news
in
such
a
tiny
paper
thought
tiny
watching
the
fountain
splash
some
day
i
ll
buy
one
to
see
what
it
suddenly
she
realized
it
was
getting
dark
people
passed
by
her
and
went
into
the
houses
she
felt
very
lonely
and
a
little
frightened
oh

she
thought
i
do
wonder
where
i
ll
sleep
i
wonder
if
it
s
against
the
law
to
sleep
on
the
park
benches
she
went
over
and
sat
down
on
one
i
guess
i
ll
try
sleeping
here
she
was
just
going
to
stretch
out
when
she
saw
a

coming
toward
her
just
as
fast
as
he
could
walk

green
leaves
at
the

everything

so
sweet
that

used
up

every
word
of
praise
she
knew
and
she
fell
asleep
before
the
little
lady
had
finished
tucking
her
in

it
must

near
midnight
when

she
cried
out

on

ears
and
picked
up
his

of

at
the
just
as

to
the
schoolhouse
which
was
the
most
delightful
school
building
tiny

imagine
it
stood
on
the
center
of
a
green
lawn
all
kinds
of
swings
and
games
were
arranged
in
the
playgrounds
the
little
lady
introduced
tiny
to
her
teacher
i

brave
a
child
under

care
smiled
miss
spectacles
for

and
the
tiny
blushed
and
stood
on
one
foot
it
didn
t
seem
very
brave
to
me
she
said
but
i
m
glad

to
a
desk
and

her
tiny
studied
the
lessons
well
and
when
came
was
quite
ready
for
play
the
children
stared
at
her
a
good
deal
for
no
doubt
they
too
had
heard
about
the
fire
and
many
had
seen
her
on
her
pony
but
she
was
so
friendly
in
her
manner
that
the
girls
soon
overcame
their
shyness
and
began
to
talk
with
her
there
was
one
particularly
pretty
girl
who
was
especially
nice
to
tiny
and
gave
her
half
her
apple
to
eat
there
was
another
little
girl
whose
mother
combed
her
hair
in
one
braid
at
the
back
of
her
head
just
as
she
started
to
talk
with
tiny
one
of
the
boys
came
along
and
pulled
the
little
girl
s
hair
hello
piggy
he
said
hello
piggy

said
the
little
girl
i
do
wish
they
wouldn
t
call

called
to
the

ha
laughed
the
boy
i

tiny
for
that

the
last

nearby
in
the
car
and

tiny
kissing
the
little
lady
will
you
martin
i

so
a
plan

on
love
trot
and
he
did

calling
the
little
girl
names
and
tiny
had
the
joy
of
knowing
she
had
made
two
people
happy

a
baby
s
tiny
said
the
little
lady
after
school
the
next
day

t
you

run
over
to
the
grocery
shop
and

tiny
there

grocerman
was
very
pleasant
and
tiny
noticed
he
gave
her
extra
good
weight

send

home
for
you
miss
he
asked
as
his
grocery
wagon
drove
up
no
thank

said
tiny
i
ll
carry
it
and
the
wagon
drove
on
as
tiny
reached
the
corner
she
saw
a
baby
toddling
across
the
street
i
wonder
that
baby
s
mother
lets
it
go
out
alone
thought
tiny
illustration
she
ran
as
fast
as
she
could
and
was
just
in
time
to
drag
the
baby
out
of
the
way
of
the
wagon
just
at
that
minute
the
grocer
s
horse
and
wagon
dashed
around
the
corner
tiny
saw
in
a
moment
what
would
happen
if
somebody
didn
t
run
to
the
baby
so
dropping
her
bag
of
sugar
which
burst
open
and
spread
all
over
the
ground
she
ran
as
fast
as
she
could
and
was
just
in
the
nick
of
time
to
drag
the
baby
out
of
the
way
of
the
wagon
bless
me
bless
me
panted
the
policeman
running
up
i
hurried
as
fast
as
i
could
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
this
little
girl
he
continued
to
the
baby
s
mother
who
was
now
crying
that
baby
would
why

the
little
girl
that
ran
away

t
run

said
the
policeman
i

by
this
time
after
the
fire
warning
and
this
but
tiny
was
hurrying
away
to
the
store
to

the
grocer

enough
for

the
baby
s
life

he
asked
her
to
ride
in
the
grocery
wagon
so
that
she
would
get
home
sooner
i
was
so
afraid
you
would
worry

she
said
as
she
told
the
story

i
spilled
all
the
sugar
every
oh
my

quickly
slipped
her
bank
into
her
all

she
she
could
scarcely
wait
for
the
time
to
come
for
her
to
go
shopping
and
it
seemed
almost
a
week
until
miss
spectacles
nodded
her
head
that
she
might
be
dismissed
on
her
way
to
the
store
she
would
put
her
hand
in
her
every

had
been
to

she
noticed
a
cute
little
china
cat
she
picked
it
up
that

cute
she
thought

not
very
useful
so
she
put
it
down

up
a
little
stuffed
dog

she
concluded
and
put
it
down
do

asked
the
saleslady
politely
no
thank

replied
tiny
she
picked
up
several
funny
little
images
and
was
so
much
interested
that
she
did
not
notice
that
any
one
was
near
until
she
heard
a
voice
a

the
saleslady

the
little
lady
was
delighted
she
opened
the
bag
and
took
out

purse
and
powder
box
and
examined
them
and
looked
at
herself
in
the
mirror

sighed

and
throwing

over
her
head

excusing
himself
he

a

i

about
everything

as
she
walked
along
the
road
to
school
my
what
perfectly
lovely
times
i
have
had
and
how
dear
the
little
lady
is
but
i
do
miss
mother
how
frightened
she
must
be
a
tear
dropped
from
her
eye
i
won
t
cry
though
she
thought
mother
surely
will
find
me
i
know
she
s
looking
everywhere
just
then
she
noticed
a
tiny
little
bird
in
the
branches
of
the
tree
overhead
wick
wick
he
sang
oh
you
pretty
little
thing
cried
tiny
the
bird
flew
to
a
low
bush
tiny
following
on
and
on
they
went
until
tiny
was
surprised
to
find
herself
at
the
end
of
the
town
why
i
m
almost
lost
again
she
thought
i
better
turn
wick
wick
sang
the
bird
as
he
alighted
on
a
tree
just
outside
the
town
to
tiny
s
amazement
he
was
no
longer
a
little
bird
but
the
same
big
woodpecker
that
she
had
followed
into
the
forest
when
she
left
home
she
was
just
about
to
run
after
him
when
a
shadow
fell
across
the
roadway
and
she
looked
up
mother
she
cried
oh
mother
for
the
shadow
was
that
of
her
mother
who
had
gone
out
into
the
woods
to
look
for
her
she
stretched
out
her
tiny
little
arms
but
she
was
so
very
small
her
mother
didn
t
see
her
oh
mother
here
i
am
she
cried
running
toward
her
she
stepped
off
the
edge
of
tinytown
and
in
a
second
she
was
her
own
self
again
as
big
as
ever
how
she
laughed
and
cried
and
hugged
and
kissed
her
mother
then
she
told
all
about
tinytown
just
as
i
ve
told
you
and
showed
her
the
lovely
little
rose
cottage
the
town
hall
the
school
house
the
church
the
house
and
the
shops
mother
they
were
all
so
perfectly
dear
to
me
i
hate
to
leave
them
she
said
why
tiny
girl
laughed
her
mother
we
can
visit
tinytown
again
now
we
know
where
it
is
then
you
can
always
keep
your
yes
and
i
can
explain
to
them
mother
dear
how
they
were
mistaken
and
i
didn
t
run
but
when
tiny
and
her
mother
came
to
look
for
it
a
few
days
later
tinytown
was
gone
the
story
people
had
taken
it
for
their
own
illustration
mother
she
cried
oh
mother
what
a
sweet
story
exclaimed
mary
frances
when
the
story
lady
finished
yes
it
is
a
sweet
story
she
returned
and
we
were
so
glad
to
get
it
and
the
town
too
it
shows
our
children
how
the
children
of
other
countries
aren
t
you
tired
after
telling
so
many
stories
asked
mary
frances
oh
no
i
never
grow
tired
of
hearing
and
telling
stories
but
i
like
to
hear
you
talk
won
t
you
tell
me
something
from
your
country
yes
let
me
see
all
i
can
think
of
is
a
little
poem
about
a
robin
and
a
do
let
me
hear
so
she
recited
the
robin
and
the
buttercup
b
down
in
the
field
one
day
in
june
the
flowers
all
bloomed
together
save
one
who
tried
to
hide
herself
and
drooped
that
pleasant
weather
a
robin
who
had
flown
too
high
and
felt
a
little
lazy
was
resting
near
a
buttercup
who
wished
she
were
a
daisy
for
daisies
grow
so
trig
and
tall
she
always
had
a
passion
for
wearing
frills
around
her
neck
in
just
the
daisies
fashion
and
buttercups
must
always
be
the
same
old
tiresome
color
while
daisies
dress
in
gold
and
white
although
their
gold
is
duller
dear
robin
said
the
sad
young
flower
perhaps
you
d
not
mind
trying
to
find
a
nice
white
frill
for
me
some
day
when
you
are
flying
you
silly
thing
the
robin
said
i
think
you
must
be
crazy
i
d
rather
be
my
honest
self
than
any
daisy
you
re
nicer
in
your
own
bright
gown
the
little
children
love
you
be
the
best
buttercup
you
can
and
think
no
flower
above
you
though
swallows
leave
me
out
of
sight
we
d
better
keep
our
places
perhaps
the
world
would
go
all
wrong
with
one
too
many
daisies
look
bravely
up
into
the
sky
and
be
content
with
knowing
that
god
wished
for
a
buttercup
just
here
where
you
are
b
sarah
orne
jewett
oh
thank
you
said
the
story
lady
i
like
that
you
must
write
it
down
for
me
you
shall
have
a
lot
of
stories
told
the
second
day
the
magic
the
closing
tom
goes
down
the
gloomy
gus
and
the
christmas
patty
and
her
pitcher
stories
told
the
second
day
xx
the
magic
mask
when
all
the
story
people
were
assembled
the
story
king
in
his
place
mary
frances
in
the
seat
of
honor
beside
the
story
queen
the
ready
writer
at
his
table
with
pen
in
hand
the
story
lady
began
to
tell
one
story
after
another
even
the
clock
ticked
softly
as
if
listening
and
no
sound
was
heard
except
the
sweet
music
of
her
voice
as
it
ran
from
story
to
story
until
five
in
all
were
told
many
years
ago
a
little
prince
was
born
in
a
rich
country
across
the
sea
he
had
long
been
wished
for
and
great
was
the
rejoicing
throughout
the
land
when
he
came
as
you
may
suppose
he
was
given
everything
he
wanted
indeed
if
he
were
denied
anything
for
a
moment
he
would
set
up
so
great
a
cry
that
the
servants
would
run
in
haste
to
bring
him
what
he
desired
and
if
he
were
opposed
by
any
one
he
would
frown
and
stamp
his
foot
and
throw
himself
into
such
a
rage
that
his
whole
face
would
become
ugly
and
distorted
and
the
little
children
would
run
in
fear
from
him
when
he
grew
up
he
delighted
to
fight
and
nothing
pleased
him
better
than
to
put
on
his
armor
and
helmet
and
ride
forth
at
the
head
of
his
army
he
won
many
many
victories
and
his
country
grew
richer
and
stronger
than
it
had
ever
been
before
by
and
by
the
time
came
when
his
father
the
king
died
and
the
prince
took
his
place
then
he
wished
for
a
queen
and
began
to
think
of
a
beautiful
princess
he
had
met
in
one
of
the
cities
which
he
ruled
over
and
the
more
he
thought
about
her
the
more
anxious
he
was
that
she
should
become
his
wife
no
one
else
was
half
so
fair
and
lovely
to
his
eyes
so
one
day
he
made
up
his
mind
to
go
to
see
the
princess
he
bade
his
servants
deck
him
out
in
regal
splendor
and
put
on
him
his
royal
robes
and
his
jeweled
crown
how
do
i
look
he
asked
his
valet
did
i
ever
appear
more
handsome
oh
no
your
majesty
replied
the
valet
if
you
will
look
in
the
long
mirror
you
will
see
when
the
king
looked
in
the
glass
he
saw
a
wonderful
reflection
his
robe
was
of
velvet
and
satin
in
royal
purple
and
green
jeweled
trimmed
and
embroidered
nothing
was
wanting
in
the
costume
then
he
saw
his
own
face
all
seamed
with
frowns
and
hard
cruel
lines
oh
he
thought
such
a
face
will
frighten
the
lovely
princess
what
shall
i
do
she
will
never
be
willing
to
marry
me
and
he
sent
all
his
servants
away
and
sat
down
in
a
fit
of
melancholy
or
as
some
people
say
in
a
fit
of
the
for
hours
he
just
sat
and
glowered
once
a
page
approached
him
to
say
that
his
luncheon
was
served
but
he
told
him
to
be
gone
before
he
ordered
his
head
chopped
off
you
can
imagine
how
fast
the
page
ran
away
when
the
page
told
the
other
servants
they
said
we
must
not
go
near
him
until
he
rings
for
us
when
he
comes
out
of
his
angry
after
a
while
the
bell
did
ring
and
in
fear
and
trembling
the
valet
went
to
see
what
the
king
wished
tell
the
groom
to
saddle
my
best
steed
and
have
it
at
the
palace
steps
within
ten
minutes
and
do
you
undress
me
and
put
me
in
my
riding
quickly
the
change
was
made
quickly
the
horse
was
saddled
quickly
the
king
was
mounted
and
riding
away
no
he
thundered
when
the
groom
rode
up
to
attend
him
on
his
journey
no
one
comes
with
me
i
ride
alone
through
forest
and
dale
through
valley
stream
and
over
stubble
the
king
rode
on
and
on
and
on
until
he
came
to
the
home
of
the
enchanter
herlo
thrice
he
knocked
at
the
door
and
a
deep
voice
bade
him
enter
enchanter
said
the
king
lifting
the
latch
and
entering
i
have
come
on
a
most
important
i
know
your
errand
replied
herlo
you
wish
to
gain
the
princess
viola
for
a
wife
and
you
fear
she
will
not
love
you
enough
to
marry
how
can
she
when
she
sees
my
face
said
the
king
i
have
come
to
ask
your
help
is
there
anything
you
can
do
for
me
the
enchanter
stopped
to
think
then
he
raised
his
head
and
told
the
king
yes
i
have
a
plan
but
it
needs
your
own
help
i
can
change
your
features
if
you
will
do
as
i
tell
the
king
was
very
glad
and
he
promised
to
do
everything
the
enchanter
bade
him
do
very
well
said
herlo
i
will
make
you
a
magic
mask
of
thinnest
wax
it
will
be
exactly
the
shape
of
your
face
and
no
one
will
know
that
you
are
wearing
it
except
yourself
i
will
paint
it
with
my
magic
paint
so
that
your
features
will
look
kind
and
pleasant
instead
of
fierce
and
stern
i
will
fasten
it
upon
your
face
so
that
you
need
never
take
it
make
it
said
the
king
as
handsome
and
attractive
as
you
possibly
can
and
i
will
pay
you
any
price
you
this
i
can
do
only
with
your
help
herlo
explained
only
on
this
one
condition
that
you
keep
your
own
face
in
exactly
the
lines
i
shall
paint
one
angry
frown
or
one
cruel
smile
will
crack
the
mask
apart
and
ruin
it
and
i
can
never
replace
now
the
king
wanted
the
princess
for
his
queen
more
than
anything
else
he
had
ever
wished
for
so
he
said
yes
i
promise
tell
me
what
i
shall
do
to
keep
the
mask
from
you
must
not
lose
your
temper
the
enchanter
told
him
you
must
think
kind
thoughts
you
must
try
to
make
your
people
happy
you
must
help
them
not
by
fighting
but
by
building
libraries
and
schools
and
hospitals
you
must
see
that
there
are
none
of
your
subjects
in
want
you
must
try
to
relieve
all
suffering
even
of
animals
you
must
follow
this
rule
help
the
weak
if
you
are
strong
love
the
old
if
you
are
young
own
a
fault
if
you
are
wrong
when
you
re
angry
hold
your
tongue
call
here
again
within
ten
days
and
the
mask
will
be
ready
so
the
king
rode
away
with
happiness
in
his
heart
the
ten
days
passed
slowly
enough
and
he
could
scarcely
wait
for
the
last
day
to
come
early
in
the
morning
he
again
rode
alone
to
the
home
of
the
enchanter
the
magic
mask
was
ready
and
herlo
tried
it
on
the
king
s
face
it
fitted
exactly
but
it
transformed
his
countenance
gone
was
the
ugly
scowl
gone
the
frown
between
his
eyes
gone
the
thin
straight
sullen
lips
in
their
stead
were
pleasant
smiles
and
kind
tender
eyes
and
merciful
unselfish
lips
and
again
the
king
rode
away
with
happiness
in
his
heart
for
herlo
had
shown
him
his
face
in
a
glass
the
next
day
he
rode
with
his
retinue
of
courtiers
to
the
home
of
the
lovely
princess
and
she
thought
him
all
that
could
be
desired
and
promised
to
be
his
wife
and
one
wonderful
day
in
the
springtime
they
were
married
two
years
sped
quickly
away
in
great
joy
and
happiness
for
the
princess
found
her
husband
to
be
even
more
kind
and
forbearing
than
she
had
thought
he
would
be
the
servants
never
could
understand
what
had
happened
to
change
the
king
instead
of
being
frightened
by
his
presence
they
were
only
too
glad
to
serve
him
and
his
royal
household
was
the
happiest
in
the
world
illustration
the
magic
mask
was
ready
and
herlo
tried
it
on
the
king
s
face
you
would
think
that
the
king
would
have
then
been
satisfied
wouldn
t
you
but
he
was
not
quite
satisfied
for
one
thing
troubled
him
when
the
queen
would
smile
in
approval
of
his
kindness
and
his
he
would
think
i
wish
i
had
not
deceived
my
dear
wife
i
wish
she
knew
my
own
at
last
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
so
one
day
he
rode
for
the
third
time
to
the
home
of
the
enchanter
herlo
and
again
herlo
met
him
at
the
door
the
king
said
o
herlo
i
have
come
to
you
to
ask
you
to
take
back
your
magic
mask
i
can
not
wear
it
any
longer
because
i
can
not
bear
to
deceive
my
dear
wife
who
thinks
me
so
kind
and
good
better
the
truth
than
to
deceive
so
true
and
kind
a
person
as
my
i
warn
you
replied
herlo
that
if
i
once
take
off
the
magic
mask
you
can
never
have
it
replaced
think
carefully
before
i
remove
yes
said
the
king
i
know
and
i
have
weighed
the
question
carefully
it
is
better
to
be
my
own
true
self
than
to
live
behind
a
false
face
better
that
the
queen
should
despise
me
than
to
live
under
false
pretenses
and
have
her
love
when
so
the
enchanter
took
off
the
mask
and
bade
the
king
you
can
imagine
how
the
king
felt
as
he
rode
home
this
time
how
he
dreaded
looking
into
his
glass
although
he
knew
he
must
do
so
before
he
entered
the
presence
of
the
queen
and
how
he
feared
that
what
he
most
prized
in
this
world
was
about
to
be
lost
his
wife
s
loving
trust
in
him
but
can
you
imagine
his
joy
when
he
looked
into
the
glass
and
saw
his
own
face
for
his
own
face
was
handsomer
than
the
mask
the
ugly
frown
and
the
wicked
cruel
lines
were
gone
for
his
face
had
been
molded
into
the
exact
likeness
of
the
mask
and
when
he
came
into
the
presence
of
his
wife
she
saw
no
difference
in
him
he
was
the
husband
she
had
always
so
much
honored
and
loved
and
they
lived
happily
ever
after
finished
the
story
lady
then
after
a
slight
pause
she
went
on
now
we
will
have
a
little
goblin
xxi
the
closing
door
there
was
once
a
little
girl
who
had
a
dear
little
room
all
her
own
which
was
full
of
treasures
and
was
as
lovely
as
love
could
make
it
you
never
could
imagine
no
matter
how
you
tried
a
room
more
beautiful
than
hers
for
it
was
white
and
shining
from
the
snowy
floor
to
the
ceiling
which
looked
as
if
it
might
have
been
made
of
a
fleecy
cloud
the
curtains
at
the
windows
were
like
the
petals
of
a
lily
and
the
little
bed
was
like
swan
s
down
there
were
white
pansies
too
that
bloomed
in
the
windows
and
a
dove
whose
voice
was
sweet
as
music
and
among
her
treasures
she
had
a
string
of
pearls
which
she
was
to
wear
about
her
neck
when
the
king
of
the
country
sent
for
her
as
he
had
promised
to
do
some
day
this
string
of
pearls
grew
longer
and
more
beautiful
as
the
little
girl
grew
older
for
a
new
pearl
was
given
her
as
soon
as
she
waked
up
each
morning
and
every
one
was
a
gift
from
this
king
who
bade
her
keep
them
fair
her
mother
helped
her
to
take
care
of
them
and
of
all
the
other
beautiful
things
in
her
room
every
morning
after
the
new
pearl
was
slipped
on
the
string
they
would
set
the
room
in
order
and
every
evening
they
would
look
over
the
treasures
and
enjoy
them
together
while
they
carefully
wiped
away
any
specks
of
dust
that
had
gotten
in
during
the
day
and
made
the
room
less
lovely
there
were
several
doors
and
windows
which
the
little
girl
could
open
and
shut
just
as
she
pleased
in
this
room
but
there
was
one
door
which
was
always
open
and
that
was
the
one
which
led
into
her
mother
s
room
no
matter
what
little
daughter
was
doing
she
was
happier
if
her
mother
was
near
and
although
she
sometimes
ran
away
into
her
own
room
and
played
by
herself
she
always
bounded
out
at
her
mother
s
first
call
and
sprang
into
her
mother
s
arms
gladder
than
ever
to
be
with
her
because
she
had
been
away
now
one
day
when
the
little
girl
was
playing
alone
she
had
a
visitor
who
came
in
without
knocking
and
who
seemed
at
first
very
much
out
of
place
in
the
shining
white
room
for
he
was
a
goblin
and
as
black
as
a
lump
of
coal
he
had
not
been
there
more
than
a
very
few
minutes
however
before
nearly
everything
in
the
room
began
to
look
more
like
him
and
less
like
driven
snow
and
although
the
little
girl
thought
that
he
was
very
strange
and
ugly
when
she
first
saw
him
she
soon
grew
used
to
him
and
found
him
an
entertaining
playfellow
she
wanted
to
call
her
mother
to
see
him
but
he
said
oh
no
we
are
having
such
a
nice
time
together
and
she
s
busy
you
so
the
little
girl
did
not
call
and
the
mother
who
was
making
a
dress
of
fine
lace
for
her
darling
did
not
dream
that
a
goblin
was
in
the
little
white
room
the
goblin
did
not
make
any
noise
you
know
for
he
tiptoed
all
the
time
as
if
he
were
afraid
and
if
he
heard
a
sound
he
would
jump
but
he
was
a
merry
goblin
and
he
amused
the
little
girl
so
much
that
she
did
not
notice
the
change
in
her
dear
room
the
curtains
grew
dingy
the
floor
dusty
and
the
ceiling
looked
as
if
it
might
have
been
made
of
a
rain
cloud
but
the
child
played
on
and
got
out
all
her
treasures
to
show
to
her
visitor
the
pansies
drooped
and
faded
the
white
dove
hid
its
head
beneath
its
wing
and
moaned
and
the
last
pearl
on
the
precious
string
grew
dark
when
the
goblin
touched
it
with
his
smutty
fingers
oh
dear
me
said
the
little
girl
when
she
saw
this
i
must
call
my
mother
for
these
are
the
pearls
that
i
must
wear
to
the
king
s
court
when
he
sends
for
never
mind
said
the
goblin
we
can
wash
it
and
if
it
isn
t
just
as
white
as
before
what
difference
does
it
make
about
one
pearl
but
mother
says
that
they
all
must
be
as
fair
as
the
morning
insisted
the
little
girl
ready
to
cry
and
what
will
she
say
when
she
sees
this
one
you
shut
the
door
then
said
the
goblin
pointing
to
the
door
that
had
never
been
closed
and
i
ll
wash
the
so
the
little
girl
ran
to
close
the
door
and
the
goblin
began
to
rub
the
pearl
but
it
only
seemed
to
grow
darker
now
the
door
had
been
open
so
long
that
it
was
hard
to
move
and
it
creaked
on
its
hinges
as
the
little
girl
tried
to
close
it
when
the
mother
heard
this
she
looked
up
to
see
what
was
the
matter
she
had
been
thinking
about
the
dress
which
she
was
making
but
when
she
saw
the
closing
door
her
heart
stood
still
with
fear
for
she
knew
that
if
it
once
closed
tight
she
might
never
be
able
to
open
it
again
she
dropped
her
fine
laces
and
ran
towards
the
door
calling
little
daughter
little
daughter
where
are
you
and
she
reached
out
her
hands
to
stop
the
door
but
as
soon
as
the
little
girl
heard
that
loving
voice
she
answered
mother
oh
mother
i
need
you
so
my
pearl
is
turning
black
and
everything
is
wrong
and
flinging
the
door
wide
open
she
ran
into
her
mother
s
arms
when
the
two
went
together
into
the
little
room
the
goblin
had
gone
the
pansies
now
bloomed
again
and
the
white
dove
cooed
in
peace
but
there
was
much
work
for
the
mother
and
daughter
and
they
rubbed
and
scrubbed
and
washed
and
swept
and
dusted
till
the
room
was
so
beautiful
that
you
would
not
have
known
that
a
goblin
had
been
there
except
for
the
one
pearl
which
was
a
little
blue
always
even
when
the
king
was
ready
for
little
daughter
to
come
to
his
court
although
that
was
not
until
she
was
a
very
old
woman
as
for
the
door
it
was
never
closed
again
for
little
daughter
and
her
mother
put
two
golden
hearts
against
it
and
nothing
in
this
world
could
have
shut
it
then
as
the
story
ended
the
story
lady
paused
while
the
clock
ticked
twice
and
then
said
next
we
will
have
a
funny
story
about
a
silver
xxii
tom
goes
down
the
well
i
see
it
i
see
it
cried
tom
eagerly
balancing
himself
perilously
over
the
it
s
down
at
the
bottom
did
you
suppose
it
would
float
asked
bess
with
a
touch
of
scorn
in
her
tones
let
me
see
cried
bob
pushing
forward
you
clear
out
said
archie
you
re
to
blame
for
dropping
it
in
you
d
better
go
before
you
tumble
in
yourself
you
little
archie
s
broken
arm
felt
very
stiff
and
his
temper
was
slightly
damaged
too
all
four
children
gathered
around
the
well
at
the
bottom
of
which
lay
the
silver
teapot
like
truth
bright
and
shining
but
apparently
not
to
be
recovered
by
mortals
bradley
had
gone
to
the
village
and
the
children
were
determined
to
get
the
silver
teapot
up
before
his
return
for
as
yet
they
had
not
thought
it
necessary
to
mention
its
disappearance
and
bradley
was
not
the
man
to
notice
its
absence
of
course
if
it
was
lost
we
should
have
to
tell
bess
had
said
to
her
brother
but
as
long
as
we
know
where
it
is
and
that
it
s
safe
there
s
no
need
to
say
anything
about
well
what
s
to
be
done
asked
archie
i
can
t
go
after
it
with
my
broken
now
i
suppose
we
will
hear
of
nothing
but
your
broken
arm
for
a
month
and
you
ll
shirk
everything
for
it
i
can
t
study
cause
my
arm
s
broken
i
can
t
go
errands
cause
my
arm
s
broken
i
can
t
go
to
church
cause
my
arm
s
broken
that
will
be
your
whine
archie
but
don
t
try
your
dodges
on
me
for
i
won
t
stand
it
if
it
really
hurts
you
i
m
sorry
and
i
ll
lick
any
fellow
that
touches
you
till
you
get
well
again
but
none
of
your
humbug
of
course
you
can
t
go
down
the
well
you
couldn
t
if
your
arm
wasn
t
this
was
from
tom
meanwhile
bess
had
gone
to
the
house
for
a
long
and
soon
returned
carrying
it
we
ll
fasten
a
hook
to
the
end
of
it
and
fish
the
teapot
up
said
she
ho
ho
do
you
suppose
it
will
bite
like
a
fish
laughed
tom
no
i
do
not
tom
bradley
but
i
suppose
if
i
tie
a
string
to
the
pole
and
fasten
an
iron
hook
to
one
end
with
a
stone
to
keep
it
down
that
i
can
wiggle
it
round
in
the
water
till
the
hook
catches
in
the
handle
and
then
we
can
drag
it
up
that
s
what
i
suppose
answered
bess
preparing
to
carry
out
her
design
there
s
something
in
that
bess
you
re
not
so
stupid
as
you
look
give
me
the
pole
and
let
me
no
go
and
get
one
for
where
will
i
find
the
hook
in
the
where
i
got
oh
get
me
one
too
cried
bob
and
me
one
too
cried
archie
before
half
an
hour
had
passed
the
four
children
all
armed
with
were
intently
wiggling
in
the
water
catching
their
hooks
in
the
stones
by
the
side
of
the
well
entangling
their
lines
digging
their
elbows
into
each
other
s
sides
in
their
frantic
attempts
to
pull
their
hooks
loose
scolding
pushing
and
getting
generally
excited
every
few
moments
tom
would
pull
bess
back
by
her
and
save
her
from
tumbling
over
in
her
eagerness
but
so
far
from
being
grateful
to
her
deliverer
bess
resented
the
treatment
indignantly
stop
jerking
my
head
so
she
cried
you
ll
be
in
in
a
minute
you
d
have
been
in
then
if
i
hadn
t
jerked
you
answered
tom
well
what
if
i
had
let
me
alone
if
i
go
in
that
s
my
own
your
own
look
in
you
mean
my
gracious
wouldn
t
you
astonish
the
toads
down
there
but
you
d
get
your
face
now
tom
you
let
me
be
i
most
had
it
that
time
so
you
ve
said
forty
times
this
is
all
humbug
i
m
going
down
on
the
rope
for
oh
no
tom
please
don
t
indeed
you
ll
be
drowned
the
rope
will
break
you
ll
kill
yourself
you
ll
catch
cold
cried
bess
in
alarm
she
could
fight
tom
all
day
long
when
in
the
mood
for
it
but
to
see
him
deliberately
rush
into
danger
or
to
contemplate
the
fact
that
a
hair
of
his
precious
head
might
be
hurt
was
more
than
our
intrepid
bess
could
bear
pooh
girl
coward
retorted
thankless
tom
pointing
the
finger
of
scorn
at
his
sister
who
s
afraid
of
what
stand
back
small
boys
i
m
going
in
and
tom
began
to
divest
himself
of
his
jacket
you
ll
poison
the
water
suggested
archie
it
will
be
so
cold
moaned
bob
but
nobody
took
any
notice
of
bob
he
was
treated
with
great
contempt
and
much
hustled
as
the
author
of
the
mischief
all
felt
that
if
tom
came
to
grief
bob
would
be
answerable
i
ll
scream
for
a
hundred
years
without
stopping
tom
cried
bess
wildly
you
shan
t
go
down
you
shan
t
i
ll
call
some
one
murray
peter
maggie
stop
screaming
and
help
said
tom
who
had
his
shirt
sleeves
rolled
up
to
the
elbow
and
his
pantaloons
to
his
knee
why
no
one
but
tom
could
tell
now
do
you
three
hold
on
tight
to
this
bucket
don
t
let
go
for
a
moment
pull
away
as
hard
as
you
can
when
i
tell
you
to
now
for
it
and
without
more
ado
tom
clung
to
the
other
rope
with
his
hands
and
twisted
his
feet
around
the
bucket
handle
hold
on
tight
and
let
me
down
easy
said
tom
and
the
three
children
clung
desperately
to
their
rope
and
lowered
him
little
by
little
long
experience
in
rescuing
cats
from
a
watery
grave
in
the
well
had
taught
the
children
how
to
manage
the
ropes
and
buckets
but
they
had
not
calculated
on
the
fact
that
tom
would
be
heavier
than
a
cat
and
it
was
with
red
faces
and
straining
muscles
that
they
dragged
away
on
their
rope
however
they
were
able
to
keep
tom
steady
and
he
clinging
with
one
hand
to
his
rope
and
pushing
himself
away
from
the
sides
of
the
well
with
the
other
made
his
dangerous
descent
as
successfully
as
though
his
coadjutors
had
been
gifted
with
samson
s
strength
a
sudden
splash
and
shiver
told
them
he
had
reached
the
water
and
a
shout
of
triumph
declared
that
the
teapot
was
rescued
as
tom
shouted
all
three
children
let
go
the
rope
and
rushed
to
the
side
of
the
well
to
look
at
the
victorious
hero
it
was
a
most
fortunate
circumstance
that
the
water
in
the
well
was
low
and
that
tom
plunged
suddenly
to
the
bottom
by
this
unexpected
movement
was
able
after
much
scrambling
to
stand
upright
with
his
head
out
of
water
otherwise
the
earthly
career
of
thomas
bradley
would
have
been
brought
to
a
sudden
and
untimely
end
as
it
was
he
stood
in
the
cold
water
up
to
his
shoulders
clinging
still
to
the
rope
holding
the
teapot
with
one
hand
and
wildly
vociferating
to
his
admiring
audience
whose
heads
hung
over
the
and
their
faces
as
seen
in
this
position
by
tom
looked
like
those
of
grinning
fiends
what
made
you
let
go
roared
tom
and
his
voice
sounded
hollow
and
unnatural
as
it
resounded
from
the
depths
of
his
cool
and
shady
retreat
oh
tom
have
you
got
it
have
you
really
ain
t
it
cold
are
you
hurt
were
you
scared
is
the
teapot
broken
were
a
few
of
the
questions
that
came
faintly
to
him
from
above
and
sounded
very
unlike
angel
whispers
to
the
diver
for
teapots
who
stood
first
on
one
leg
then
on
the
other
to
prevent
equal
cramp
in
both
draw
me
up
you
silly
children
you
goose
of
a
bess
why
don
t
you
draw
me
up
we

so
tired
called
down
archie

helped
to
lower

with
only
one
arm
but
i

more

arm

bess
draw
me
up
i
tell
you
screamed
tom
from
below
i
will
tom
i
m
going
to
answered
bess
who
now
reached
up
and
recovered
the
bucket
that
had
flown
with
a
jerk
to
the
top
of
the
when
it
had
been
so
suddenly
abandoned
but
all
the
united
efforts
of
bess
and
bob
and
archie
s
left
arm
could
not
raise
tom
after
a
desperate
tug
he
was
raised
an
inch
and
suddenly
lowered
again
the
result
was
a
splash
a
scramble
below
and
tom
s
voice
sputtering
incoherent
invectives
again
and
again
the
children
tugged
and
again
and
again
tom
splashed
scrambled
and
sputtered
at
last
a
red
anxious
face
looked
down
to
him
and
bessie
s
voice
choked
with
tears
called
out
oh
tom
do
hold
on
till
i
call
maggie
we
can
t
get
you
away
ran
bess
to
call
help
followed
by
archie
but
bob
whose
ideas
on
some
points
were
as
yet
but
feebly
developed
seized
one
of
the
long
poles
and
began
to
poke
at
his
brother
with
it
under
the
impression
that
some
good
would
come
of
these
unaided
efforts
bob
be
done
you
ll
put
my
eye
out
cried
poor
tom
desperately
as
the
swinging
iron
hook
circled
around
his
head
catch
hold
catch
hold
cried
bob
getting
excited
as
he
saw
how
near
he
came
to
grappling
his
brother
just
let
me
get
up
once
and
i
ll
catch
hold
muttered
tom
wrathfully
then
raising
his
voice
he
yelled
as
loud
as
he
could
for
help
pete
but
peter
was
a
mile
away
and
consequently
could
not
hear
maggie
had
improved
the
occasion
of
her
master
s
absence
to
visit
her
friend
and
neighbor
miss
flaherty
for
half
an
hour
and
kate
summoned
from
her
baking
came
to
the
rescue
but
only
assisted
by
wringing
her
hands

moaned
the
captive
tom
who
looked
like
a
triton
blowing
on
a
as
he
stood
with
uplifted
teapot
he
seemed
to
think
the
teapot
should
be
kept
dry
at
all
hazards
and
wearied
his
arm
to
keep
it
above
water
i
ll
run
next
door
and
call
wilson
said
bess
more
hopefully
and
started
on
this
errand
while
kate
suddenly
inspired
rushed
to
the
kitchen
sink
where
stood
the
iron
pump
connected
by
a
pipe
with
the
well
and
began
to
pump
vigorously
apparently
with
the
anticipation
of
seeing
tom
ooze
through
the
spout
for
which
purpose
and
to
make
the
matter
surer
she
removed
the
filter
as
bess
ran
she
was
suddenly
stopped
at
the
gate
by
the
sight
of
a
carriage
which
had
just
driven
up
and
out
of
which
now
stepped
aunt
maria
and
aunt
maria
s
husband
uncle
daniel
these
were
the
very
grimmest
and
grandest
of
all
the
relations
when
they
came
to
see
mamma
bess
had
always
to
sit
perfectly
still
on
a
chair
answer
very
politely
have
her
very
best
dress
on
her
hair
parted
directly
in
the
middle
and
be
intensely
proper
as
for
the
boys
they
suffered
the
torture
by
soap
and
water
and
endured
their
new
jackets
could
not
whittle
nor
whistle
nor
wrestle
and
were
sustained
under
these
tribulations
only
by
the
expectation
of
a
very
good
dinner
and
a
bully
dessert
the
china
always
came
out
on
these
occasions
the
best
tablecloth
and
napkins
the
heaviest
silver
forks
and
spoons
the
silver
and
oh
agony
of
agonies
the
silver
teapot
for
one
awful
moment
bess
stood
stunned
then
her
anxiety
for
tom
overcame
every
other
consideration
and
before
aunt
maria
could
say
how
do
you
do
elizabeth
she
had
caught
her
uncle
by
his
august
and
in
a
piteous
voice
besought
him
to
come
and
pull
on
the
rope
pull
on
a
rope
elizabeth
said
uncle
daniel
in
mild
astonishment
why
should
i
pull
on
a
rope
my
dear
and
aunt
maria
murmured
very
astonishing
thing
for
a
child
to
oh
come
quick
hurry
faster
tom
s
down
in
the
well
cried
bess
with
freely
flowing
tears
tom
down
a
well
and
how
did
he
get
there
uncle
daniel
never
hurried
and
required
a
reason
always
for
the
hope
that
was
in
his
friends
he
went
down
for
the
teapot
sobbed
bess
the
silver
teapot
and
we
can
t
pull
him
up
again
and
he
s
all
cramped
with
cold
oh
do
hurry
the
silver
teapot
down
the
well
my
mother
s
silver
teapot
daniel
didn
t
i
always
say
that
mary
bradley
should
never
have
had
that
teapot
this
must
be
looked
and
with
dignified
strides
aunt
maria
marched
to
the
well
tom
s
teeth
by
this
time
were
chattering
so
that
he
fully
expected
they
would
all
drop
out
and
the
three
fishers
were
so
completely
demoralized
by
their
fears
as
to
be
speechless
uncle
daniel
was
a
slow
man
he
leisurely
looked
down
at
tom
then
up
at
the
wheel
then
at
the
rope
and
calmly
remarked
all
new
i
then
he
slowly
took
off
his
coat
and
as
slowly
carried
it
into
the
house
stopped
to
give
an
order
to
his
coachman
who
had
driven
around
to
the
stable
and
came
with
measured
pace
to
where
the
three
frightened
children
stood
listening
to
aunt
maria
who
was
doing
her
duty
by
them
strictly
and
fully
uncle
daniel
then
took
hold
of
the
rope
gave
a
long
strong
calm
pull
and
in
an
instant
tom
dripping
with
coolness
arose
from
the
as
soon
as
they
had
stopped
laughing
the
story
teller
said
i
will
now
tell
you
a
christmas
story
of
the
great
xxiii
gloomy
gus
and
the
christmas
cat
the
canadian
miner
was
the
first
of
the
men
to
finish
washing
up
on
his
return
from
the
mine
where
s
barbara
he
asked
tossing
his
towel
at
a
peg
she
has
a
little
cold
and
i
put
her
to
bed
replied
clair
the
anxiety
in
the
mother
s
voice
kept
him
from
asking
any
more
questions
he
followed
the
other
men
in
to
supper
it
seems
lonesome
without
barbara
said
mcgill
the
mining
engineer
the
rough
men
had
made
a
pet
of
the
laughing
little
girl
and
they
missed
her
she
had
slipped
into
their
lives
so
quietly
that
they
did
not
realize
how
much
they
looked
forward
to
seeing
her
at
the
end
of
the
day
and
barbara
returned
their
love
a
mining
camp
is
hardly
the
place
for
a
child
but
barbara
s
father
was
dead
and
her
mother
became
the
cook
at
the
little
bear
mine
after
supper
the
men
sat
in
a
grave
silent
circle
before
the
great
open
fireplace
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
to
talk
about
other
evenings
these
big
rough
men
had
had
barbara
to
romp
with
all
except
gloomy
gus
but
then
gloomy
gus
never
showed
any
interest
in
anything
he
was
a
big
gruff
swede
whose
name
appeared
on
the
company
s
books
as
gustavus
schwarstun
to
the
men
however
he
was
gloomy
this
will
give
me
a
chance
to
finish
her
snowshoes
the
canadian
finally
said
with
an
assumed
air
of
gayety
christmas
is
almost
he
went
to
the
bunk
room
and
returned
with
a
pair
of
small
snowshoes
he
was
making
every
one
of
the
men
was
making
barbara
a
present
every
one
but
gloomy
gus
mcgill
eyed
him
sharply
the
big
swede
did
something
which
at
another
time
would
have
met
with
a
roar
of
laughter
but
not
a
man
smiled
when
he
pulled
a
ball
of
red
yarn
and
a
mitten
out
of
his
pocket
i
learned
how
to
do
it
in
the
old
country
he
said
as
he
busied
his
rough
calloused
fingers
with
the
crude
pine
knitting
needles
he
had
made
he
had
unraveled
the
sleeve
of
a
new
red
sweater
to
get
the
yarn
he
needed
the
men
found
it
hard
to
work
that
evening
and
trooped
off
to
their
bunks
earlier
than
usual
mcgill
remained
he
went
down
the
hall
to
clair
s
room
where
a
light
was
still
burning
and
tapped
gently
i
m
going
to
put
a
cot
in
the
mess
room
and
sleep
in
there
he
told
her
you
may
need
it
was
after
midnight
when
she
called
him
mcgill
found
the
little
patient
s
fever
high
he
listened
to
barbara
s
labored
breathing
and
counted
her
pulse
when
he
looked
up
he
found
clair
watching
him
anxiously
he
knew
from
her
eyes
that
she
shared
his
fear
the
fear
that
barbara
might
have
pneumonia
mcgill
had
helped
the
doctor
fight
several
cases
of
the
disease
in
those
mountains
they
had
generally
been
losing
fights
but
he
set
to
work
the
big
hobnailed
boots
of
the
men
fell
softly
on
the
rough
floors
as
their
wearers
slipped
in
for
breakfast
they
had
prepared
it
themselves
and
ate
it
silently
during
the
meal
mcgill
came
in
he
looked
worried
and
did
not
eat
after
they
had
finished
the
men
waited
for
him
to
speak
it
s
pneumonia
he
said
briefly
that
was
all
soon
the
men
slipped
off
quietly
to
the
mine
and
mcgill
went
back
to
barbara
by
night
barbara
was
delirious
it
looks
bad
mcgill
admitted
to
the
men
she
is
fretting
over
that
when
barbara
came
to
the
little
bear
mine
she
had
brought
with
her
a
small
maltese
kitten
her
dearest
possession
the
death
of
the
little
kitten
a
week
before
had
been
the
greatest
tragedy
in
her
young
life
after
supper
the
men
tried
to
work
on
their
presents
but
somehow
the
work
dragged
the
hours
passed
but
the
men
did
not
leave
the
mess
room
toward
midnight
mcgill
came
out
to
them
mrs
clair
says
you
had
better
come
in
now
if
you
want
to
see
her
she
s
she
s
going
the
whole
crew
from
mucker
to
foreman
tiptoed
down
the
hall
all
except
gus
he
didn
t
seem
to
notice
that
they
went
into
the
sick
room
they
filed
and
stood
in
a
little
embarrassed
group
by
the
door
barbara
tossed
fretfully
on
the
bed
her
eyes
glowing
with
unnatural
brightness
i
want
a
kitty
santa
claus
i
want
my
kitty
she
wailed
feebly
the
canadian
miner
tears
rolling
down
his
cheeks
left
the
room
the
others
followed
gus
was
still
in
his
place
by
the
fire
when
they
returned
i
can
t
stand
it
to
see
her
begging
for
that
kitten
said
the
canadian
i
would
risk
my
life
to
get
one
for
her
i
d
try
to
get
to
telluride
if
i
thought
i
could
get
back
in
time
to
do
any
a
minute
afterwards
gus
got
up
slowly
and
went
out
to
the
bunk
room
but
gus
did
not
stop
there
long
he
drew
on
an
extra
sweater
rubber
coat
and
furs
snatched
his
skis
and
pole
and
slipped
from
the
house
it
was
after
midnight
the
thermometer
registered
way
below
zero
the
wind
swirled
down
from
the
mountain
tops
with
the
lash
of
a
gale
but
gus
did
not
mind
the
storm
a
master
of
the
ski
he
swung
down
the
trail
with
a
speed
that
mocked
the
wind
at
his
back
telluride
the
nearest
town
was
thirteen
miles
away
the
only
route
leading
there
being
over
a
zigzag
pack
trail
from
the
mine
this
trail
descends
the
crest
of
a
ridge
until
it
strikes
the
edge
of
the
canyon
staggers
back
and
forth
down
the
steep
face
of
the
canyon
then
for
the
rest
of
the
way
meekly
follows
the
river
it
is
only
a
pack
trail
narrow
and
dangerous
at
best
during
the
summer
a
line
of
burros
or
donkeys
winds
along
it
bringing
down
ore
from
the
mine
and
carrying
back
provisions
but
when
winter
sets
in
the
trail
becomes
very
dangerous
and
the
zigzags
have
caused
the
death
of
many
prospectors
who
have
stayed
too
late
in
the
mountains
or
taken
the
trail
too
early
in
the
spring
gus
had
little
difficulty
down
the
first
part
of
the
trail
in
an
hour
he
reached
the
zigzags
they
were
covered
with
hanging
masses
of
snow
that
threatened
with
every
blast
to
go
grinding
down
the
wall
of
the
canyon
by
his
pole
gus
held
himself
on
to
the
side
of
the
canyon
moving
cautiously
across
hanging
drifts
he
made
his
way
only
by
grim
desperate
effort
at
the
end
of
thirty
minutes
of
hard
struggle
he
stood
down
the
trail
then
a
savage
blast
tore
a
pile
of
clinging
snow
from
the
top
and
drove
it
at
him
gus
saw
it
start
gathering
speed
and
bulk
as
it
came
the
whole
mountain
side
began
to
move
tons
of
snow
were
slipping
and
he
was
directly
in
their
path
there
was
no
way
of
dodging
the
avalanche
he
must
outrace
it
there
was
no
time
to
zigzag
back
and
forth
down
the
side
of
the
canyon
he
had
to
take
as
direct
a
route
as
the
avalanche
he
threw
his
pole
from
his
grasp
and
shot
ahead
of
the
oncoming
mass
of
snow
death
was
behind
him
before
him
rocks
jutted
out
to
trip
him
and
endangered
his
course
illustration
he
swung
down
the
trail
with
a
speed
that
mocked
the
wind
at
his
back
but
he
rode
his
skis
with
reckless
abandon
leaping
twisting
dodging
down
the
slope
behind
him
crashed
the
snow
he
was
veering
to
the
left
to
escape
its
path
a
leap
brought
him
to
the
bottom
of
the
canyon
but
before
he
could
glide
to
safety
a
mass
of
snow
at
the
side
of
the
slide
caught
and
hurled
him
before
it
bruised
and
half
buried
a
desperate
struggle
freed
him
his
skis
were
broken
his
muscles
were
bruised
and
twisted
it
was
three
when
he
reached
the
outskirts
of
the
town
mounting
the
steps
of
the
first
house
he
rained
heavy
blows
upon
the
door
the
owner
stuck
his
head
out
of
a
window
who
s
there
he
asked
give
me
a
cat
gus
ordered
in
a
rough
voice
are

yelled
the
enraged
man
at
the
window

little
bear
over

zigzags
impossible
give
me
a
cat
or
i
ll
break
your
door
in
presently
a
light
glimmered
through
the
night
and
a
hastily
clad
man
joined
gus
a
search
of
the
neighborhood
produced
a
cat
and
fresh
skis
in
half
an
hour
gus
was
on
the
trail
back
at
the
mine
the
men
had
not
gone
to
their
bunks
that
night
they
huddled
before
the
fireplace
awaiting
the
dreaded
news
mcgill
slipped
by
now
and
then
on
some
errand
the
night
dragged
through
and
christmas
dawned
christmas
this
was
the
first
time
they
had
planned
a
real
christmas
since
they
left
their
homes
years
ago
but
now
the
heart
had
been
taken
out
of
the
day
they
sat
down
to
a
listless
breakfast
mcgill
came
in
she
s
still
fighting
she
s
got
to
win
or
lose
pretty
soon
he
said
they
did
not
go
to
the
mine
that
morning
it
was
the
first
christmas
the
little
bear
mine
had
not
run
at
ten
o
clock
mcgill
came
in
to
report
boys

longer
she
s
wearing
her
strength
away
fretting
for
that
cat
i
m
not
sure
that
a
cat
would
really
quiet
her
and
i
hardly
believe
any
living
man

it
to
telluride
but
i

canadian

said
the
men

gus
and
i
are
the
only
two
good
enough
on
skis
to
have
a
fighting
gus
that
brute
hasn
t
got
the
heart
of
a
mine
mule
he
wouldn
t
go
at
the
point
of
a
gun
where
is
he
i
haven
t
seen
him
since
last
night
stormed
the
foreman
silently
the
men
watched
the
canadian
prepare
for
the
trail
they
were
rough
men
who
held
life
cheaply
but
not
one
of
them
believed
a
man
had
a
chance
to
make
the
trail
and
return
safely
suddenly
the
door
opened
and
gus
staggered
in
he
tried
to
cross
the
room
but
his
muscles
refused
to
act
and
he
sank
to
the
floor
the
men
sprang
to
him
laid
him
on
a
cot
pulled
off
his
furs
and
unbuttoned
his
coat
underneath
the
coat
was
an
old
sack
one
of
the
men
gave
it
a
shake
out
on
the
floor
rolled
a
kitten
it
told
the
story
it
told
them
that
gus
was
a
hero
the
next
morning
when
consciousness
returned
to
gus
the
men
carried
his
cot
into
barbara
s
room
on
the
bed
he
could
see
a
little
figure
frail
and
worn
but
sleeping
the
restful
sleep
of
exhaustion
one
little
arm
was
outside
the
covers
hugging
up
closely
a
fluff
of
a
kitten
beside
the
bed
he
saw
the
mother
smiling
happily
through
her
tears
for
she
knew
that
barbara
would
get
well
xxiv
patty
and
her
pitcher
at
the
end
of
the
story

to

large
circle
drawn
on
the
carpet
about
which
all
the
story
people
were
grouped
you
are
going
to
hear
the

acted
at
the
same
time

control
the
action
with
her
the
magic
mary
frances
sat
listening
entranced
to
the
voice
of
the
story
lady
it
flowed
on
and
on
like
sweet
music
now
rising
now
falling
filling
the
ear
with
charming
sound
and
the
imagination
with
a
perfect
picture
of
the
story
she
was
telling
the
story
began
the
most
charming
little
girl
in
her
native
village
was
patty
at
the
words
a
little
girl
patty
not
much
bigger
than
tiny
of
tinytown
sprang
up
in
the
circle
with
her
little
home
and
the
village
all
about
her
the
pigeons
flew
down
to
coo
around
her
and
they
flew
down
and
cooed
the
chickens
fed
from
her
hand
and
the
chickens
came
running
the
cat
rolled
over
her
feet
and
purred
and
the
cat
did
it
the
steady
old
dog
bluff
cut
his
liveliest
capers
and
bluff
did
it
as
the
story
fell
from
the
story
lady
s
lips
there
was
instant
obedience
in
the
village
of
the
magic
circle
the
characters
obeyed
the
voice
instantly
just
as
the
feet
of
children
dancing
obey
the
music
of
the
piano
so
the
story
flowed
on
the
acting
kept
pace
with
the
voice
and
did
everything
the
words
said
mary
frances
sat
spellbound
for
she
had
never
seen
anything
so
beautiful
as
the
way
in
which
that
wonderful
voice
brought
every
player
and
every
action
to
her
ears
and
eyes
at
the
same
time
this
is
the
story
if
you
keep
your
eyes
on
the
magic
circle
you
can
see
it
as
mary
frances
saw
it
through
the
veil
of
words
wonderful
the
most
charming
little
girl
in
her
native
village
was
patty
at
least
so
all
the
neighbors
said
and
what
everybody
says
ought
to
have
some
truth
in
it
patty
deserved
their
kind
words
for
she
loved
everybody
and
everything
and
in
return
she
was
loved
by
all
who
knew
her
the
pigeons
flew
down
from
their
little
house
to
coo
around
her
the
chickens
fed
from
her
hand
the
cat
rolled
over
her
feet
and
purred
with
pleasure
and
even
the
steady
old
dog
bluff
put
himself
to
the
trouble
of
cutting
his
liveliest
capers
to
attract
her
attention
patty
was
always
busy
too
about
something
when
she
was
no
higher
than
your
knee
she
used
to
bustle
about
and
do
little
things
in
the
handiest
manner
and
as
for
sewing
she
was
the
pattern
child
at
the
dame
s
school
where
her
sampler
was
hung
upon
the
wall
as
a
guide
to
the
other
children
she
lived
in
a
little
cottage
with
her
parents
who
were
now
old
and
very
poor
and
depended
upon
their
little
daughter
for
many
things
which
they
were
too
feeble
to
do
for
themselves
one
of
her
daily
duties
was
to
go
to
the
spring
for
water
she
would
dip
her
pitcher
into
the
clear
bright
liquid
and
sing
her
sweet
little
songs
with
a
voice
that
made
every
one
who
passed
that
way
stop
to
listen
with
delight
upon
one
of
her
journeys
to
the
spring
occurred
the
great
event
of
her
life
of
which
i
am
now
about
to
tell
you
patty
had
filled
her
pitcher
at
the
spring
and
was
carrying
it
home
with
some
little
difficulty
for
it
was
quite
heavy
when
filled
when
almost
in
sight
of
her
cottage
she
saw
a
poor
old
woman
sitting
by
the
wayside
as
if
overcome
by
the
fatigue
of
a
long
journey
she
sat
upon
the
trunk
of
a
fallen
tree
her
face
was
as
brown
as
a
nut
and
covered
with
a
complete
network
of
wrinkles
while
her
dim
eyes
looked
dull
and
sunken
at
her
back
was
tied
a
bundle
which
seemed
quite
large
enough
for
a
strong
man
to
carry
she
watched
patty
as
she
came
near
and
cast
eager
eyes
upon
the
water
in
the
pitcher
which
seemed
so
cool
and
tempting
and
after
looking
at
patty
s
rosy
face
she
asked
for
some
water
dear
little
child
said
she
in
a
feeble
voice
give
me
a
drink
from
your
pitcher
for
i
am
very
old
and
faint
and
to
be
sure
mother
and
welcome
said
patty
sweetly
as
she
raised
up
the
pitcher
so
that
the
old
woman
could
drink
long
and
eagerly
did
the
poor
creature
drink
of
the
delicious
water
so
long
indeed
that
patty
was
much
surprised
at
her
extreme
thirst
thank
you
my
darling
heaven
will
reward
you
for
your
kindness
said
the
old
woman
oh
you
are
quite
welcome
mother
said
patty
again
shouldering
her
pitcher
and
going
cheerfully
on
her
way
singing
in
the
lightness
of
her
heart
at
the
pleasure
of
having
relieved
the
poor
woman
s
distress
but
she
had
not
gone
far
before
she
was
overtaken
by
a
large
dog
who
seemed
to
be
bound
upon
a
long
journey
for
he
was
covered
with
dust
his
eyes
were
bloodshot
and
his
parched
tongue
hung
from
his
mouth
to
catch
the
cool
air
poor
fellow
said
patty
in
a
kind
voice
the
dog
turned
around
at
the
words
and
stopped
to
look
at
her
she
held
out
her
hand
and
he
came
nearer
she
then
set
down
her
pitcher
to
caress
him
but
he
strove
eagerly
to
reach
the
pitcher
which
his
instinct
told
him
contained
water
patty
understood
his
wants
and
held
the
pitcher
to
the
poor
dog
so
that
he
could
drink
with
comfort
he
lapped
and
lapped
until
she
began
to
think
he
would
never
leave
off
at
last
he
looked
up
into
her
face
and
licked
her
hand
in
gratitude
then
after
bounding
and
gamboling
about
to
show
how
refreshed
he
was
trotted
on
his
way
patty
now
looked
into
her
pitcher
and
found
that
it
was
more
than
half
empty
so
that
she
must
take
all
her
journey
over
again
for
it
was
of
no
use
going
home
with
a
pitcher
but
half
full
as
she
rose
she
saw
some
by
the
side
of
the
road
which
appeared
to
be
in
a
very
drooping
dusty
state
so
she
at
once
poured
over
them
all
the
water
that
remained
in
the
pitcher
then
with
her
pitcher
once
more
upon
her
shoulder
she
turned
her
steps
again
toward
the
spring
without
a
single
regret
at
the
double
work
she
had
to
do
she
traveled
blithely
on
over
the
dusty
road
cheering
the
way
with
her
sweet
songs
and
soon
arrived
once
more
at
the
margin
of
the
spring
resting
for
a
few
minutes
in
the
shade
she
gazed
sleepily
at
the
bubbling
water
and
all
kinds
of
fanciful
thoughts
passed
through
her
mind
she
was
just
dropping
off
into
a
little
nap
when
she
thought
she
heard
some
one
call
her
by
name
it
was
a
sweet
little
voice
and
patty
could
hardly
distinguish
it
from
the
tinkling
of
the
spring
she
rose
quickly
to
her
feet
and
looked
in
every
direction
for
the
owner
of
the
voice
but
in
vain
till
suddenly
casting
eyes
upon
the
spring
she
saw
to
her
amazement
a
dear
little
face
looking
up
at
her
from
the
water
and
presently
there
stood
before
her
one
of
the
most
beautiful
little
creatures
patty
had
ever
seen
she
balanced
lightly
upon
the
surface
of
the
rippling
water
where
she
seemed
to
stand
with
the
same
ease
as
patty
did
upon
the
land
and
was
really
no
higher
than
the
pitcher
so
patty
said
she
so
you
have
come
back
again
my
dear
yes
madam
replied
patty
who
to
say
the
truth
felt
somewhat
alarmed
yes
madam
because
i
i
know
all
about
it
said
the
fairy
for
it
was
a
fairy
you
know
and
it
is
because
i
do
know
that
you
see
me
here
for
i
am
now
come
to
make
you
a
useful
a
present
said
patty
with
a
pleased
surprise
yes
and
such
a
one
replied
the
fairy
as
will
be
a
lasting
reward
for
your
goodness
of
heart
toward
others
and
your
little
care
for
yourself
you
blush
because
you
do
not
remember
the
many
kind
things
you
have
done
and
i
am
the
more
pleased
to
see
that
you
think
i
am
giving
you
unmerited
praise
that
you
think
so
little
of
all
the
kind
actions
which
are
the
ornament
of
your
life
assures
me
of
the
purity
of
your
motives
for
it
is
our
duty
to
forget
the
good
we
do
to
others
and
to
remember
only
the
good
that
others
do
to
us
you
have
always
done
so
my
dear
patty
to
reward
you
i
will
place
a
spell
upon
your
pitcher
which
will
always
be
full
of
water
or
milk
as
you
may
desire
it
will
also
be
able
to
move
and
work
whenever
you
wish
it
and
will
always
prove
your
firm
friend
in
any
trouble
if
it
should
by
any
mishap
be
parted
from
you
it
will
easily
by
its
magic
powers
be
able
to
find
you
and
in
whatever
position
you
may
happen
to
be
you
will
always
find
it
by
your
side
as
adviser
and
friend
so
put
your
pitcher
on
the
ground
and
look
into
illustration
she
then
touched
the
pitcher
with
her
wand
patty
did
so
and
to
her
surprise
saw
the
bright
water
gradually
rising
until
the
pitcher
was
full
to
the
brim
when
she
saw
it
was
full
she
tried
to
lift
it
but
found
it
too
heavy
for
her
strength
you
need
not
trouble
yourself
to
carry
it
said
the
fairy
smiling
it
will
save
you
all
further
trouble
on
that
she
then
touched
the
pitcher
with
her
wand
when
to
patty
s
greater
surprise
two
very
legs
grew
out
of
the
bottom
and
a
pair
of
neat
little
arms
appeared
at
the
top
of
the
vessel
which
as
soon
as
it
was
firm
on
its
legs
made
a
very
polite
bow
to
patty
as
its
future
mistress
now
patty
said
the
fairy
follow
your
pitcher
and
you
can
not
possibly
go
wrong
and
as
she
finished
speaking
she
gradually
faded
away
and
at
last
broke
into
a
thousand
sparkling
drops
which
mingled
with
the
bubbling
stream
and
were
soon
borne
away
on
its
bosom
patty
rubbed
her
eyes
as
if
to
make
sure
that
she
was
awake
for
the
whole
thing
seemed
to
her
like
a
wonderful
dream
she
coughed
aloud
and
at
last
began
to
pinch
herself
until
she
found
it
painful
when
she
finally
concluded
that
she
must
be
really
awake
but
more
convincing
than
all
there
stood
the
saucy
brown
pitcher
firmly
upon
its
sturdy
green
legs
with
its
toes
turned
out
in
the
politest
manner
of
the
day
and
its
little
fists
planted
in
its
sides
in
a
style
that
was
very
indeed
quite
ready
to
start
mistress
said
a
little
voice
that
made
patty
jump
for
the
fairy
had
not
told
her
that
the
pitcher
could
speak
but
screwing
up
courage
she
said
come
on
then
pitcher
and
set
the
example
by
starting
off
into
a
run
and
didn
t
the
pitcher
follow
her
in
good
earnest
indeed
it
ran
so
fast
that
it
soon
overtook
her
and
not
only
that
but
it
ran
beyond
her
long
before
she
got
home
but
the
most
surprising
thing
was
that
although
it
hopped
along
with
the
most
wonderful
strides
and
jumps
over
the
rough
places
in
its
path
it
did
not
spill
one
single
drop
of
water
in
its
progress
this
puzzled
patty
who
with
her
utmost
care
could
never
avoid
wetting
her
dress
whenever
she
had
tried
to
run
with
the
pitcher
even
half
full
what
will
people
think
when
we
get
into
the
village
thought
patty
as
she
looked
at
her
strange
companion
i
m
sure
they
will
be
frightened
and
what
will
father
and
mother
say
when
they
see
what
i
have
brought
home
with
me
do
not
trouble
yourself
about
that
said
the
pitcher
who
seemed
to
know
her
thoughts
your
parents
will
soon
get
accustomed
to
me
and
be
much
pleased
when
they
see
how
handy
i
am
for
you
do
not
yet
know
half
of
my
good
as
he
was
speaking
they
came
to
a
very
high
stile
shall
i
help
you
over
said
patty
thinking
of
his
short
legs
oh
dear
no
said
the
pitcher
see
how
little
i
need
and
so
saying
he
skipped
over
the
stile
in
the
most
graceful
manner
as
he
did
so
a
dog
who
was
passing
put
his
tail
between
his
legs
and
after
two
or
three
very
weak
barks
scurried
off
in
evident
fright
and
surprise
a
man
was
at
the
same
time
coming
along
the
road
with
a
slow
and
pompous
walk
for
he
was
the
squire
of
the
village
who
upon
seeing
the
strange
pitcher
clear
the
stile
was
rendered
almost
speechless
with
amazement
but
as
soon
as
he
saw
the
little
legs
speeding
toward
him
he
uttered
one
loud
exclamation
of
terror
and
fled
his
hat
flew
one
way
his
cane
another
and
his
cloak
mounted
into
the
air
like
wings
being
very
fat
however
he
had
not
gone
far
before
his
legs
failed
him
and
he
lay
kicking
in
a
furze
bush
roaring
for
help
patty
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
sight
but
the
pitcher
trotting
on
with
the
greatest
unconcern
soon
reached
the
cottage
door
to
the
astonishment
of
patty
s
parents
the
pitcher
walked
quietly
into
the
cottage
and
sat
down
in
a
corner
tucking
its
legs
carefully
under
it
so
that
no
one
could
see
them
the
neighbors
therefore
who
had
been
alarmed
at
the
squire
s
account
of
his
fright
and
disaster
and
came
to
the
cottage
in
crowds
only
saw
a
pitcher
such
as
they
all
had
at
home
and
put
the
old
squire
down
as
being
a
little
bit
out
of
his
mind
patty
was
awakened
next
morning
by
hearing
a
noise
below
as
if
someone
was
very
busy
with
the
furniture
she
heard
the
chairs
pushed
about
and
presently
the
handle
of
a
pail
klink
down
as
plain
as
could
be
so
she
put
on
her
clothes
and
crept
down
stairs
she
peeped
cautiously
through
the
red
curtains
at
the
bottom
and
there
to
her
wondering
surprise
she
saw
what
do
you
think
not
any
thieves
but
the
astonishing
pitcher
and
what
do
you
think
it
was
doing
why
it
was
mopping
up
the
red
tiles
of
the
floor
as
handily
as
if
it
had
never
done
anything
else
all
the
days
of
its
life
and
more
wonderful
still
the
fire
was
made
and
was
burning
brightly
upon
the
hearth
we
can
imagine
a
pitcher
of
water
washing
the
floor
but
we
can
not
imagine
it
doing
anything
else
with
a
fire
except
putting
it
out
but
no
the
fire
was
lighted
the
kettle
was
on
and
there
it
was
merrily
singing
a
little
song
about
breakfast
being
nearly
ready
good
morning
dear
mistress
said
the
pitcher
cheerfully
you
need
not
trouble
yourself
to
do
anything
but
grow
and
improve
your
mind
for
from
henceforth
you
will
have
but
little
labor
to
do
as
i
am
here
to
do
it
for
you
may
suppose
that
patty
was
well
pleased
to
hear
this
for
she
was
now
growing
to
be
a
tall
girl
and
felt
a
great
desire
to
improve
herself
with
books
which
as
yet
she
had
had
very
little
time
to
do
having
been
so
much
taken
up
with
her
household
cares
when
patty
was
left
alone
in
the
evening
with
the
pitcher
she
told
him
how
much
she
was
obliged
to
him
for
all
he
had
done
and
how
much
she
wished
to
learn
but
did
not
know
what
to
do
for
books
as
she
had
read
the
few
she
already
possessed
many
times
over
oh
i
can
soon
help
you
there
said
the
pitcher
for
you
have
only
to
wish
and
i
will
yield
you
as
much
milk
as
you
desire
you
can
then
make
butter
and
cheese
and
go
sell
them
at
the
market
town
buy
as
many
books
as
you
like
and
have
something
left
for
other
purposes
no
sooner
said
than
done
patty
set
out
all
the
pans
she
had
and
all
she
could
borrow
from
her
kind
neighbors
and
as
fast
as
they
came
the
pitcher
ran
about
and
filled
them
so
that
she
soon
had
plenty
of
cream
for
her
butter
and
cheese
she
had
only
to
ask
and
a
good
neighbor
lent
her
a
churn
while
the
pitcher
furnished
a
pair
of
arms
to
do
the
churning
and
such
butter
was
produced
as
had
not
been
seen
in
the
village
for
many
a
day
you
may
suppose
that
patty
was
pleased
and
as
for
her
dear
old
parents
they
hardly
knew
what
to
make
of
it
all
the
same
good
neighbor
lent
her
a
gentle
horse
and
some
baskets
and
early
one
lovely
morning
she
started
for
the
to
which
the
pleased
pitcher
pointed
out
the
way
he
did
not
go
with
her
as
he
said
the
people
of
the
town
were
not
accustomed
to
see
brown
pitchers
with
legs
so
he
should
stay
at
home
and
see
about
making
the
cheese
patty
rode
cheerfully
on
her
way
looking
as
happy
and
handsome
as
the
best
farmer
s
daughter
of
them
all
so
everybody
in
the
market
said
and
she
soon
sold
all
her
butter
at
the
very
best
prices
of
the
day
and
so
patty
went
on
thriving
and
doing
good
to
every
one
in
need
until
in
course
of
time
she
grew
into
a
beautiful
and
lovable
young
woman
living
in
comfort
with
her
old
parents
in
one
of
the
prettiest
cottages
in
the
village
every
one
said
that
she
deserved
her
good
fortune
no
one
envied
her
she
was
loved
by
young
and
old
so
as
you
may
well
believe
she
was
happy
as
the
day
is
long
and
now
a
wonderful
thing
came
to
pass
which
changed
the
whole
course
of
patty
s
simple
and
contented
life
one
evening
she
was
standing
in
her
garden
feeding
her
pigeons
when
a
stranger
approached
the
gate
after
looking
at
her
with
admiration
for
a
moment
he
bowed
gracefully
at
the
same
time
removing
his
plumed
hat
and
in
the
politest
manner
inquired
the
way
to
the
next
town
patty
answered
him
pleasantly
and
as
she
spoke
the
music
of
her
voice
and
the
charming
modesty
of
her
manner
seemed
to
strike
the
young
man
with
surprise
and
pleasure
he
looked
at
her
intently
for
a
moment
which
made
patty
s
eyes
seek
the
ground
in
blushing
confusion
then
bowing
again
with
greater
respect
than
before
he
proceeded
slowly
on
his
way
often
looking
back
for
another
glimpse
of
sweet
patty
and
now
as
you
probably
guess
the
handsome
young
stranger
came
again
and
again
although
he
knew
his
way
very
well
indeed
between
the
village
and
the
neighboring
town
at
last
she
found
that
it
was
the
way
to
her
heart
he
was
seeking
he
told
her
parents
that
he
was
rich
and
wished
to
have
a
wife
of
whom
every
one
spoke
well
he
did
not
care
how
poor
she
might
be
so
that
she
loved
him
since
he
had
wealth
enough
for
both
and
could
choose
to
marry
when
and
where
he
pleased
you
must
not
suppose
however
that
patty
fell
into
the
arms
of
the
young
stranger
at
once
he
coaxed
her
a
great
deal
before
she
consented
to
be
his
wife
as
she
wanted
to
make
sure
that
he
was
as
upright
in
character
as
he
was
handsome
in
appearance
the
parents
smiled
as
they
looked
upon
the
ardent
and
handsome
lover
whom
however
they
did
not
think
a
bit
too
good
for
their
darling
patty
and
so
in
as
short
a
time
as
was
possible
they
were
happily
married
now
the
stranger
who
had
married
patty
was
a
prince
in
disguise
and
the
pretty
became
a
great
princess
surrounded
with
all
the
splendor
of
her
high
station
did
patty
now
forget
her
early
home
and
her
old
friend
the
pitcher
no
she
did
not
for
the
pitcher
went
with
her
but
her
parents
wished
to
end
their
days
in
the
peaceful
village
where
they
were
born
in
the
splendid
state
in
which
she
now
lived
the
pitcher
was
as
useful
to
her
as
before
though
in
a
different
way
when
the
poor
came
to
the
palace
gate
he
gave
them
bread
and
nourishing
soup
for
their
families
for
which
they
daily
blessed
the
kind
princess
who
relieved
their
wants
so
you
see
the
pitcher
although
now
not
called
upon
to
work
still
continued
in
the
name
of
his
mistress
to
do
good
to
all
around
in
but
alas
the
best
of
us
can
not
escape
from
envious
hearts
and
wicked
tongues
and
so
it
befell
with
patty
her
dream
of
happiness
was
short
many
of
the
wicked
courtiers
envied
her
the
love
of
the
people
to
whom
patty
was
endeared
by
her
gentle
kindness
and
they
whispered
slanders
into
the
ears
of
the
prince
her
husband
who
at
last
i
am
sorry
to
say
was
weak
enough
to
listen
to
them
for
they
aroused
his
fears
by
telling
him
that
she
was
trying
to
bribe
the
people
by
her
charities
to
rebel
against
him
they
also
said
that
she
was
served
by
evil
spirits
and
pointed
to
the
good
and
innocent
pitcher
as
a
proof
of
their
wicked
tales
alas
for
human
weakness
the
prince
at
last
became
convinced
of
her
guilt
and
although
his
heart
ached
he
had
her
put
into
one
of
the
dungeons
of
the
palace
and
there
poor
patty
was
left
to
mourn
over
the
too
easy
belief
of
her
husband
in
her
guilt
she
did
not
however
mourn
long
for
as
night
came
on
the
prison
door
gently
opened
and
there
to
her
great
delight
she
saw
the
faithful
pitcher
with
a
bunch
of
keys
in
his
hand
come
said
he
let
us
return
to
your
peaceful
home
and
show
your
husband
that
it
is
his
heart
and
not
his
riches
that
you
covet
he
will
come
back
to
reason
and
repentance
when
he
finds
he
has
lost
poor
patty
followed
him
in
deep
grief
but
they
had
not
gone
far
in
their
flight
when
she
perceived
with
alarm
that
they
were
followed
by
a
band
of
soldiers
she
screamed
with
fright
illustration
be
not
alarmed
dear
mistress
said
the
pitcher
pitcher
to
the
be
not
alarmed
dear
mistress
said
the
pitcher
i
will
soon
stop
their
so
saying
he
bent
over
the
side
of
a
rock
and
poured
out
a
cataract
of
water
through
the
valley
in
which
the
soldiers
were
marching
soon
the
water
swelled
into
huge
waves
which
swept
the
soldiers
from
their
path
and
compelled
them
to
save
their
lives
by
swimming
to
the
nearest
land
when
wet
and
dispirited
they
soon
returned
to
their
master
the
foolish
prince
that
night
patty
slept
once
more
beneath
the
sheltering
roof
of
her
parents
who
as
you
may
suppose
received
their
darling
with
open
arms
she
once
more
found
herself
in
her
beloved
garden
and
the
flowers
as
you
may
believe
were
often
watered
with
her
tears
it
was
but
natural
that
her
thoughts
should
wander
to
the
home
of
her
husband
and
that
she
should
grieve
over
his
cruelty
in
return
for
her
pure
and
ardent
love
hope
however
whispered
to
her
in
the
midst
of
her
tears
that
he
would
yet
learn
how
false
the
stories
were
that
had
caused
not
only
her
unhappiness
but
his
also
the
pitcher
too
was
always
at
her
side
to
give
her
comfort
in
her
silent
sorrow
and
thus
days
and
weeks
rolled
on
but
no
news
or
messenger
reached
her
from
her
husband
had
he
entirely
abandoned
her
or
did
he
believe
her
to
have
been
swept
by
the
torrent
that
had
so
nearly
drowned
his
soldiers
who
were
too
busy
looking
out
for
their
own
safety
to
notice
what
had
become
of
her
she
hoped
that
it
was
so
as
that
in
a
measure
would
excuse
him
and
even
now
he
might
be
mourning
her
as
lost
to
him
forever
for
surely
she
thought
long
ere
this
the
evil
tongues
must
have
appeared
to
him
in
their
true
light
one
morning
she
rose
earlier
than
usual
she
was
restless
and
could
not
sleep
the
pure
air
was
cool
and
refreshing
to
her
fevered
brow
looking
sadly
around
her
she
saw
the
dear
old
pitcher
trimming
the
flowers
just
like
an
experienced
gardener
good
morning
dear
mistress
said
he
rubbing
his
hands
cheerfully
you
are
up
betimes
for
the
sun
has
hardly
yet
peeped
into
the
valley
i
am
glad
you
are
so
early
afoot
as
you
see
i
am
taking
extra
care
with
the
garden
for
i
expect
visitors
visitors
said
patty
with
an
inquiring
look
yes
visitors
said
the
pitcher
from
whose
mouth
issued
a
low
chuckling
laugh
i
can
distinctly
hear
footsteps
in
the
distance
and
they
are
coming
this
way
listen
they
are
now
near
enough
for
mortal
ears
to
hear
and
so
they
were
nearer
and
nearer
they
came
presently
the
figure
of
a
traveler
with
a
hood
over
his
face
came
in
sight
he
stopped
a
moment
threw
back
his
hood
and
stood
struck
with
amazement
for
it
was
the
prince
her
husband
who
believed
her
to
be
dead
drowned
in
the
valley
after
she
had
escaped
from
prison
this
said
the
pitcher
is
the
visitor
i
expected
believing
you
to
be
dead
he
has
wandered
in
many
lands
to
cure
his
grief
and
at
last
ventured
to
this
quiet
cottage
to
see
once
more
the
spot
where
he
first
had
the
good
fortune
to
meet
you
he
has
bitterly
grieved
over
the
sin
he
has
committed
in
believing
you
guilty
of
coveting
his
riches
when
he
alone
was
all
your
riches
and
your
delight
that
you
are
still
alive
is
the
reward
for
his
sincere
repentance
he
finds
you
in
your
parents
home
where
he
saw
you
first
regretting
nothing
of
your
past
life
except
the
loss
of
the
husband
you
love
so
the
faithful
pitcher
here
ceased
speaking
the
prince
rushed
forward
with
a
cry
of
delight
and
knelt
at
patty
s
feet
and
begged
her
forgiveness
the
pitcher
like
a
discreet
friend
placed
her
hand
in
his
and
went
into
the
cottage
the
prince
now
happy
in
his
love
which
had
increased
a
hundred
fold
wished
at
once
to
return
to
his
palace
and
desired
to
send
forward
a
messenger
so
that
he
might
bring
back
his
recovered
wife
in
triumph
the
pitcher
upon
this
came
out
and
joined
them
prince
said
he
spare
yourself
this
trouble
i
am
here
to
render
a
last
service
to
my
mistress
since
your
sincere
love
now
leaves
nothing
for
her
to
desire
the
fairy
who
appointed
me
to
reward
her
for
the
greatest
of
human
virtues
now
recalls
me
to
her
behold
as
he
ceased
speaking
jets
of
sparkling
water
rose
high
in
the
air
from
his
mouth
until
the
valley
was
filled
by
a
lovely
lake
upon
which
floated
a
gilded
barge
manned
by
stout
rowers
in
the
prince
s
livery
and
gay
with
flags
of
all
colors
patty
then
took
an
affectionate
leave
of
her
parents
and
she
and
her
husband
stepped
into
the
barge
still
the
water
flowed
from
the
pitcher
s
mouth
until
the
lake
grew
into
a
mighty
river
down
which
they
floated
until
they
came
in
sight
of
their
beautiful
home
standing
high
upon
the
rocks
which
bordered
the
stream
hundreds
of
flags
floated
from
the
towers
and
booming
cannon
sent
forth
a
noisy
welcome
crowds
of
rejoicing
people
stood
to
receive
their
beloved
mistress
whose
kindness
had
long
ago
endeared
her
to
their
grateful
hearts
and
when
at
length
they
landed
the
people
rushed
forward
happy
if
they
even
succeeded
in
kissing
the
hem
of
her
garment
after
that
patty
lived
many
years
in
peace
and
prosperity
but
the
magic
pitcher
was
seen
no
more
for
patty
was
happy
and
its
loving
task
was
done
as
the
story
lady
ceased
speaking
the
actors
vanished
from
the
magic
circle
into
thin
air
oh
i
wish
i
could
learn
to
tell
stories
like
that
exclaimed
mary
frances

now
the

folded
the
copies
of

stepped
up
with
a

bow

handed

arthur
and

when
the

people
were
assembled
on
the
third
day
the
story
lady
began
in
the
early
days
of
britain
there
lived
a
noble
king
arthur
and
his
brave
knights
of
the
round
table
the
king
and
his
knights
were
famous
for
their
feats
of
arms
their
deeds
of
valor
and
their
many
adventures
among
them
none
was
nobler
and
braver
than
king
arthur
until
galahad
came
but
galahad
surpassed
them
all
because
he
accomplished
the
feat
in
which
so
many
failed
he
conquered
himself
as
you
shall
hear
now
king
arthur
held
his
court
three
times
a
year
at
christmas
at
easter
and
at
pentecost
in
the
lovely
town
of
camelot
here
stood
camelot
castle
with
its
high
towers
and
great
jousting
field
in
the
meadow
by
the
river
where
the
knights
held
their
tournaments
and
performed
their
feats
of
arms
at
these
times
all
the
brave
knights
of
christendom
flocked
to
camelot
and
the
bravest
were
chosen
to
sit
at
the
round
table
where
they
feasted
told
their
adventures
and
planned
new
deeds
of
valor
here
king
arthur
would
charge
them
to
commit
no
murder
outrage
or
treason
also
to
be
courteous
and
never
to
refuse
mercy
always
to
defend
women
and
children
on
pain
of
death
and
never
to
fight
in
a
wrong
quarrel
for
law
or
worldly
goods
and
to
this
he
pledged
both
old
and
young
every
year
at
the
high
feast
of
pentecost
in
the
center
of
the
great
hall
of
the
castle
with
its
lofty
arches
and
high
windows
stood
the
round
table
merlin
the
magician
so
the
tale
goes
made
the
round
table
in
token
of
the
roundness
of
the
world
for
all
the
bravest
of
the
world
christian
and
heathen
resort
to
the
round
table
and
when
they
are
chosen
to
be
of
that
company
they
think
themselves
more
happy
and
more
in
honor
than
if
they
had
gotten
half
the
when
merlin
had
made
this
wonderful
table
he
said
that
by
the
knights
who
sat
about
it
the
truth
of
the
holy
grail
should
be
well
known
now
the
holy
grail
was
the
cup
which
was
supposed
to
have
been
used
by
our
saviour
at
the
last
supper
and
was
said
to
have
been
brought
into
britain
by
joseph
of
arimathea
after
a
time
through
the
sin
of
those
who
had
charge
of
it
this
holy
vessel
became
lost
and
the
knights
of
the
round
table
sought
to
recover
it
but
only
a
knight
who
was
perfectly
blameless
in
thought
word
and
act
could
hope
to
succeed
when
merlin
was
asked
who
was
best
fitted
for
this
quest
he
said
that
three
blameless
knights
should
achieve
it
and
that
one
of
the
three
should
surpass
his
father
as
much
as
the
lion
surpasses
the
leopard
both
in
strength
and
boldness
those
who
heard
merlin
say
this
said
since
there
is
to
be
such
a
knight
you
should
make
by
your
skill
a
seat
for
him
to
sit
merlin
answered
that
he
would
do
this
and
so
he
made
the
perilous
seat
in
which
no
man
dare
sit
on
pain
of
being
hurt
except
the
knight
for
whom
the
seat
was
made
this
knight
was
sir
galahad
of
whom
the
poet
tennyson
writes
my
good
sword
carves
the
casques
of
men
my
tough
lance
thrusteth
sure
my
strength
is
as
the
strength
of
ten
because
my
heart
is
the
tales
themselves
are
from
an
old
book
le
morte
d
arthur
written
by
sir
thomas
malory
in
the
fifteenth
century
receives
the
order
of
one
day
at
pentecost
when
the
tables
were
set
ready
for
the
feasting
to
begin
there
rode
into
the
great
hall
of
the
castle
a
fair
gentlewoman
on
horseback
her
horse
covered
with
sweat
and
foam
quickly
alighting
she
came
to
king
arthur
who
was
surrounded
by
his
knights
and
saluted
him
damsel
god
bless
you
said
the
king
sir
said
she
show
me
where
sir
launcelot
there
you
may
see
him
said
the
king
pointing
to
the
knight
she
went
to
sir
launcelot
and
said
sir
launcelot
i
salute
you
and
require
that
you
come
with
what
is
your
will
with
me
asked
sir
launcelot
you
shall
soon
know
and
understand
she
replied
well
said
he
i
will
gladly
go
with
sir
launcelot
bade
his
squire
saddle
his
horse
and
bring
his
armor
the
queen
then
came
to
sir
launcelot
and
asked
in
surprise
will
you
leave
us
at
the
high
feast
the
gentlewoman
answered
for
him
madam
he
shall
be
with
you
again
at
so
sir
launcelot
departed
with
the
gentlewoman
and
rode
into
a
great
forest
till
he
came
to
an
abbey
when
the
squire
opened
the
gates
he
entered
and
descended
from
his
horse
and
there
met
two
of
his
cousins
sir
bors
and
sir
lionel
who
were
very
glad
to
see
him
sir
said
sir
bors
what
adventure
brings
you
here
we
thought
to
see
you
at
camelot
a
gentlewoman
brought
me
here
said
sir
launcelot
but
i
know
not
the
while
they
were
talking
twelve
nuns
came
in
bringing
with
them
galahad
a
youth
so
handsome
and
that
scarcely
in
the
world
might
men
find
his
match
and
all
the
ladies
wept
sir
said
one
of
the
ladies
we
bring
here
your
son
whom
we
have
nourished
for
you
and
we
pray
you
now
to
make
him
a
knight
for
he
could
not
receive
the
order
of
knighthood
from
a
worthier
man
s
sir
launcelot
looked
at
the
young
squire
and
thought
that
for
his
age
he
had
never
seen
so
fine
a
man
is
this
your
own
desire
he
asked
yes
replied
his
son
then
you
shall
receive
the
high
order
of
knighthood
said
sir
launcelot
early
in
the
morning
at
galahad
s
desire
he
made
him
a
knight
and
said
god
make
him
a
good
man
for
he
is
as
handsome
as
any
man
that
this
he
did
in
the
presence
of
his
two
cousins
and
the
ladies
of
the
abbey
now
fair
sir
said
he
will
you
come
with
me
to
the
court
of
king
arthur
sir
said
sir
galahad
i
can
not
go
with
you
at
this
time
but
shortly
i
will
sir
launcelot
then
departed
with
his
cousins
and
returned
to
camelot
and
the
king
and
queen
and
all
the
knights
were
exceeding
glad
to
see
them
adventure
of
the
sword
in
the
when
the
king
and
his
knights
entered
the
great
hall
for
the
feast
they
were
surprised
to
see
on
the
seats
about
the
round
table
their
names
in
letters
of
gold
which
told
where
each
one
ought
to
sit
when
they
came
to
the
perilous
seat
they
saw
letters
which
said
four
hundred
and
winters
have
now
passed
since
the
birth
of
our
lord
and
this
seat
ought
to
be
they
all
said
this
is
a
strange
and
a
marvelous
sir
launcelot
then
counted
the
time
and
said
it
seems
to
me
this
seat
ought
to
be
filled
for
this
is
the
feast
of
pentecost
after
the
four
hundred
and
year
and
if
it
please
all
here
let
no
one
see
these
words
till
he
arrives
who
ought
to
achieve
this
then
they
took
a
silken
cloth
and
covered
the
letters
in
the
perilous
seat
and
the
king
ordered
the
dinner
to
be
served
sir
said
sir
kay
the
steward
if
you
go
now
to
dinner
you
will
break
an
old
custom
of
your
court
for
you
never
sit
down
on
this
day
until
you
have
seen
some
you
speak
the
truth
said
king
arthur
but
i
was
so
glad
to
see
sir
launcelot
and
his
cousins
that
i
forgot
the
while
they
were
still
speaking
a
squire
came
in
and
said
to
the
king
sir
i
bring
you
marvelous
what
are
they
he
asked
sir
i
saw
in
the
river
below
a
great
stone
floating
on
the
water
and
in
it
a
sword
then
said
the
king
i
will
see
that
the
knights
went
with
him
down
to
the
river
and
saw
there
a
stone
of
red
marble
floating
like
a
great
millstone
and
in
the
middle
was
stuck
a
beautiful
sword
in
the
handle
of
which
were
words
formed
of
precious
stones
set
in
gold
which
said
never
shall
man
draw
me
out
save
the
one
by
whose
side
i
ought
to
hang
and
he
shall
be
the
best
knight
of
the
when
the
king
read
the
letters
he
said
to
sir
launcelot
fair
sir
this
sword
ought
to
be
yours
for
i
am
sure
you
are
the
best
knight
of
the
sir
answered
sir
launcelot
soberly
it
is
not
my
sword
nor
am
i
bold
enough
to
grasp
it
for
it
ought
not
to
hang
by
my
side
also
whoever
attempts
to
draw
it
and
fails
will
receive
a
wound
and
will
not
live
long
after
and
i
am
sure
you
must
know
that
the
adventures
of
the
holy
grail
will
now
fair
nephew
said
the
king
to
sir
gawain
attempt
it
once
for
sir
said
sir
gawain
i
will
obey
your
immediately
he
grasped
the
sword
by
the
handle
but
could
not
stir
it
i
thank
you
said
king
arthur
sir
gawain
said
sir
launcelot
this
sword
will
one
day
hurt
you
so
sorely
that
you
will
wish
you
had
never
put
your
hand
to
it
for
the
best
castle
of
the
sir
said
sir
gawain
i
might
not
resist
my
uncle
s
when
king
arthur
heard
this
he
was
sorry
and
then
he
bade
sir
percival
try
it
who
said
that
he
would
gladly
to
bear
sir
gawain
company
thereupon
he
took
hold
of
the
sword
and
drew
it
strongly
but
he
could
not
even
move
it
after
that
there
was
no
one
who
was
bold
enough
to
attempt
it
now
you
may
go
to
dinner
said
sir
kay
for
you
have
seen
a
marvelous
galahad
sits
in
the
perilous
the
king
and
all
the
knights
then
returned
to
the
castle
and
each
knight
sat
in
his
own
place
at
the
table
and
the
young
men
who
were
not
knights
served
them
when
all
were
served
and
all
the
seats
were
filled
except
the
perilous
seat
a
strange
thing
happened
for
all
the
windows
and
doors
of
the
castle
shut
by
themselves
yet
for
all
that
the
hall
was
not
greatly
darkened
king
arthur
was
the
first
to
speak
fair
comrades
he
said
we
have
seen
marvels
but
methinks
ere
night
we
shall
see
still
greater
even
while
he
was
speaking
an
old
man
came
in
clothed
all
in
white
and
none
of
the
knights
knew
who
he
was
or
where
he
came
from
with
him
was
a
young
knight
in
red
armor
without
sword
or
shield
but
an
empty
scabbard
hung
by
his
side
peace
be
with
you
gentlemen
said
the
old
man
then
to
king
arthur
sir
i
bring
you
a
young
knight
who
is
of
king
s
lineage
and
of
the
kindred
of
joseph
of
arimathea
therefore
the
marvels
of
this
court
and
of
strange
countries
shall
be
fully
illustration
immediately
he
grasped
the
sword
by
the
handle
but
could
not
stir
it
the
king
was
truly
glad
to
hear
this
and
said
sir
you
are
heartily
welcome
and
the
young
knight
with
when
the
young
knight
had
taken
off
his
armor
he
stood
in
a
coat
of
red
silk
and
the
old
man
put
on
his
shoulder
a
mantle
furred
with
fine
ermine
and
said
sir
follow
then
he
led
the
way
to
the
perilous
seat
beside
which
sat
sir
launcelot
and
then
lifted
up
the
cloth
and
found
new
letters
which
said
this
is
the
seat
of
sir
galahad
the
good
sir
said
the
old
man
know
well
this
place
is
sir
galahad
sat
down
safely
in
the
perilous
seat
and
then
said
to
his
guide
sir
you
may
now
go
your
way
for
you
have
done
as
you
were
commanded
to
do
and
recommend
me
to
my
grandfather
king
pelleas
and
say
that
i
shall
come
to
see
him
as
soon
as
i
when
the
old
man
departed
twenty
squires
met
him
and
they
took
their
horses
and
rode
away
the
knights
of
the
round
table
wondered
greatly
at
sir
galahad
because
he
was
so
youthful
and
because
he
dared
to
sit
in
the
perilous
seat
and
they
did
not
know
where
he
was
from
save
from
god
and
they
said
this
is
he
by
whom
the
holy
grail
shall
be
achieved
for
no
man
ever
before
sat
there
sir
launcelot
looked
at
his
son
with
great
joy
and
sir
bors
said
to
his
comrades
upon
pain
of
my
life
this
young
knight
shall
come
to
great
there
was
so
much
noise
in
the
hall
that
the
queen
heard
it
and
she
had
a
great
desire
to
see
the
knight
who
dared
such
an
adventure
when
dinner
was
done
the
king
rose
and
went
to
sir
galahad
s
seat
and
lifted
the
cloth
and
read
his
name
then
he
showed
it
to
sir
gawain
and
said
fair
nephew
now
we
have
among
us
the
blameless
knight
who
will
bring
honor
to
us
all
and
upon
pain
of
my
life
he
shall
achieve
the
holy
grail
as
sir
launcelot
has
given
us
to
king
arthur
then
came
to
sir
galahad
and
said
sir
you
are
welcome
for
you
shall
move
many
good
knights
to
seek
the
holy
grail
and
you
shall
achieve
what
no
other
knight
has
been
able
to
galahad
wins
the
sword
of
balin
le
the
king
then
took
sir
galahad
by
the
hand
and
went
down
to
the
river
to
show
him
the
adventure
of
the
stone
and
the
queen
and
many
ladies
went
with
them
and
saw
the
stone
floating
in
the
water
sir
said
the
king
to
him
here
is
a
great
marvel
as
ever
i
saw
and
right
good
knights
have
attempted
it
and
sir
answered
sir
galahad
that
is
no
marvel
for
the
adventure
is
not
theirs
but
mine
and
because
of
this
sword
i
brought
none
with
me
for
its
empty
scabbard
hangs
by
my
then
he
grasped
the
sword
quickly
and
drew
it
out
of
the
stone
and
put
it
into
his
scabbard
and
said
now
it
goes
better
than
it
did
sir
said
the
king
a
shield
also
god
shall
send
now
said
sir
galahad
i
have
the
sword
that
once
belonged
to
the
good
knight
sir
balin
le
savage
with
this
sword
he
slew
his
brother
balan
and
that
was
a
great
pity
for
neither
knew
that
he
fought
his
brother
until
wounded
to
with
that
they
saw
a
lady
on
a
white
horse
riding
along
the
river
bank
toward
them
she
saluted
the
king
and
queen
and
asked
for
sir
launcelot
i
am
here
fair
lady
said
sir
launcelot
then
she
said
weeping
your
great
doings
are
changed
since
this
damsel
why
do
you
say
so
demanded
sir
launcelot
i
say
truth
said
she
for
you
were
the
best
knight
in
the
world
but
whoever
said
so
now
would
be
proved
a
liar
there
is
one
better
than
you
for
you
dared
not
grasp
the
sword
therefore
i
ask
you
to
remember
that
you
are
no
longer
the
best
knight
in
the
as
to
that
said
he
i
know
well
i
was
never
the
yes
said
the
damsel
you
were
and
are
yet
of
any
sinful
man
of
the
world
and
sir
she
said
to
the
king
nacien
the
hermit
sends
word
of
the
greatest
honor
that
ever
befell
king
in
britain
for
the
holy
grail
shall
appear
to
thee
and
all
thy
comrades
of
the
round
having
thus
spoken
the
damsel
took
her
leave
and
departed
the
same
way
that
she
came
now
said
the
king
i
am
sure
that
all
of
you
who
sit
at
the
round
table
will
set
out
in
quest
of
the
holy
grail
and
i
shall
never
see
you
together
again
therefore
let
us
go
to
the
meadow
of
camelot
and
hold
a
tournament
so
that
after
your
death
men
may
say
that
we
were
all
together
on
this
to
this
they
all
agreed
and
assembled
with
their
arms
in
the
jousting
field
now
the
king
wished
to
prove
sir
galahad
and
to
see
what
he
would
do
at
the
king
s
request
he
put
on
his
armor
but
would
not
take
a
shield
then
sir
gawain
begged
him
to
take
a
spear
which
he
did
and
the
queen
sat
in
a
tower
with
all
her
ladies
to
see
the
tournament
then
sir
galahad
took
his
place
in
the
field
and
began
to
break
marvelously
the
spears
of
those
who
rode
against
him
so
that
men
wondered
in
a
short
while
he
overthrew
and
unhorsed
many
of
the
good
knights
of
the
round
table
save
two
sir
launcelot
and
sir
percival
then
the
king
made
sir
galahad
alight
from
his
horse
and
unlace
his
helmet
so
that
queen
guinevere
might
see
him
closely
when
she
saw
him
she
said
truly
he
is
the
son
of
sir
launcelot
for
never
did
two
men
more
resemble
each
other
it
is
no
wonder
that
he
has
great
a
lady
who
stood
by
said
madam
ought
he
of
right
to
be
so
good
a
knight
illustration
then
sir
galahad
took
his
place
in
the
field
yes
said
she
for
he
comes
of
the
best
knights
in
the
world
and
of
the
highest
knights
of
the
round
table
set
out
in
quest
of
the
holy
the
king
and
all
his
knights
then
left
the
jousting
field
and
rode
to
camelot
church
to
evensong
and
after
that
they
went
home
to
supper
at
supper
as
each
knight
sat
in
his
own
place
at
the
round
table
there
arose
a
great
storm
and
the
cracking
and
crying
of
the
thunder
was
so
terrible
that
they
thought
the
roof
and
walls
of
the
castle
were
breaking
apart
in
the
midst
of
the
blast
a
sunbeam
entered
the
great
window
seven
times
whiter
than
the
light
of
day
then
every
knight
seemed
fairer
than
his
comrades
had
ever
seen
him
and
no
one
dared
speak
for
a
long
while
but
all
looked
at
each
other
as
if
they
had
been
dumb
then
there
entered
on
the
sunbeam
the
holy
grail
but
it
was
covered
with
a
white
silken
cloth
so
that
no
one
could
see
it
or
who
bore
it
then
the
hall
was
filled
with
sweet
odors
and
every
knight
had
such
meat
and
drink
as
he
liked
best
and
when
the
holy
grail
had
been
borne
through
the
hall
it
departed
as
suddenly
as
it
came
and
the
marvelous
light
with
it
but
no
one
knew
where
when
they
had
breath
to
speak
the
king
gave
thanks
certainly
said
he
we
ought
greatly
to
thank
our
lord
for
what
he
has
shown
us
at
this
high
feast
of
now
said
sir
gawain
we
have
been
served
with
the
food
we
liked
best
but
are
sorry
that
we
did
not
see
the
holy
grail
uncovered
therefore
i
will
here
make
a
vow
to
set
forth
on
its
quest
to
be
gone
a
year
and
a
day
or
longer
if
need
be
and
i
shall
not
return
till
i
have
seen
it
more
openly
than
if
i
do
not
find
it
i
shall
return
again
if
it
be
not
contrary
to
the
will
of
our
when
the
knights
of
the
round
table
heard
this
the
most
part
of
them
arose
and
made
the
same
vow
but
king
arthur
was
greatly
displeased
for
he
well
knew
that
they
might
not
break
their
vows
alas
said
he
your
vows
will
nearly
slay
me
they
will
rob
me
of
the
bravest
comrades
and
the
truest
knights
ever
seen
together
in
any
realm
and
i
foresee
that
we
shall
never
meet
in
fellowship
again
for
many
of
you
that
i
have
loved
as
well
as
my
life
will
die
in
this
with
that
the
tears
came
into
his
eyes
and
he
said
sir
gawain
sir
gawain
you
have
given
me
great
sorrow
for
i
much
doubt
that
my
true
fellowship
shall
ever
meet
here
ah
said
sir
launcelot
comfort
yourself
it
will
bring
us
greater
honor
than
if
we
had
died
in
any
other
quest
for
of
death
we
are
ah
sir
launcelot
said
the
king
the
great
love
i
have
had
for
you
all
the
days
of
my
life
makes
me
say
such
sorrowful
words
for
christian
king
never
had
so
many
worthy
men
at
his
table
as
i
have
had
at
the
round
table
when
the
queen
and
her
gentlewomen
heard
these
things
they
were
filled
with
sorrow
for
their
knights
held
them
in
great
honor
and
affection
but
the
queen
was
the
most
sorely
grieved
of
all
i
marvel
said
she
that
the
king
will
permit
them
to
leave
thus
all
the
court
was
troubled
that
night
and
many
of
the
ladies
desired
to
accompany
their
husbands
but
an
old
knight
arose
and
said
this
could
not
be
for
in
so
high
and
dangerous
a
service
they
must
go
forth
alone
after
a
while
they
all
went
to
rest
and
sir
galahad
was
put
to
bed
in
the
king
s
own
chamber
as
soon
as
it
was
daylight
the
king
arose
for
he
had
no
sleep
that
night
for
sorrow
he
went
at
once
to
sir
gawain
and
sir
launcelot
and
said
again
ah
sir
gawain
sir
gawain
you
have
betrayed
me
for
my
court
will
never
be
restored
but
you
will
never
be
as
sorry
for
me
as
i
am
for
with
that
the
tears
began
to
run
down
his
face
and
he
said
ah
knight
sir
launcelot
i
ask
that
you
counsel
me
for
i
wish
this
quest
to
be
undone
and
it
can
sir
said
sir
launcelot
you
saw
yesterday
that
many
worthy
knights
were
sworn
to
this
quest
and
they
can
not
break
their
that
i
know
well
said
the
king
but
my
grief
at
their
going
is
so
great
that
no
joy
will
ever
heal
after
the
king
had
gone
the
two
knights
ordered
their
squires
to
bring
their
arms
and
when
they
were
armed
they
joined
their
comrades
and
all
went
to
the
church
to
hear
their
service
after
the
service
was
over
the
king
took
count
of
those
who
had
taken
the
vow
to
search
for
the
holy
grail
and
found
that
there
were
a
hundred
and
fifty
all
knights
of
the
round
table
when
they
had
bidden
the
queen
and
their
ladies
farewell
they
put
on
their
helmets
and
were
ready
to
set
forth
and
there
was
weeping
and
great
sorrow
then
the
queen
departed
to
her
chamber
to
hide
her
grief
so
the
knights
mounted
their
horses
and
rode
through
the
streets
of
camelot
and
there
was
much
weeping
of
both
rich
and
poor
and
the
king
turned
away
for
he
could
not
speak
for
weeping
after
leaving
the
town
the
men
at
arms
rode
all
day
and
toward
evening
arrived
at
a
castle
called
vagon
the
lord
of
the
castle
was
a
good
old
man
and
he
opened
his
gates
and
made
them
welcome
and
gave
them
good
cheer
and
there
they
passed
the
night
in
the
morning
they
all
agreed
that
they
should
separate
so
bidding
each
other
farewell
they
departed
and
each
knight
took
the
way
that
pleased
him
best
galahad
finds
a
white
shield
with
a
red
now
sir
galahad
rode
four
days
without
adventure
for
as
yet
he
had
no
shield
on
the
fourth
day
toward
evening
he
arrived
at
a
white
abbey
where
he
was
received
with
great
honor
there
he
found
two
knights
of
the
round
table
sir
badgemagus
and
sir
uwaine
who
were
delighted
to
see
him
and
they
went
to
supper
together
sirs
said
sir
galahad
what
adventure
brought
you
here
sir
they
answered
we
are
told
there
is
a
shield
in
this
place
and
whoever
wears
it
about
his
neck
will
be
wounded
to
death
within
three
days
or
else
be
maimed
ah
sir
said
sir
badgemagus
i
shall
wear
it
and
attempt
this
strange
by
my
faith
cried
sir
galahad
sir
said
sir
badgemagus
if
i
do
not
achieve
the
adventure
of
the
shield
you
shall
try
it
for
i
am
sure
you
shall
not
sir
said
sir
galahad
i
agree
right
well
to
that
for
i
have
no
the
next
day
when
sir
badgemagus
inquired
for
the
shield
a
monk
led
him
behind
the
altar
where
the
shield
hung
as
white
as
snow
but
in
the
center
was
a
red
cross
sir
said
the
monk
no
knight
ought
to
hang
this
shield
about
his
neck
unless
he
be
the
worthiest
in
the
world
therefore
i
counsel
you
to
be
well
said
sir
badgemagus
i
know
i
am
not
the
worthiest
knight
in
the
world
yet
i
shall
attempt
to
wear
he
then
took
the
shield
and
said
to
sir
galahad
if
it
please
you
i
pray
you
remain
here
till
you
know
how
i
i
shall
await
you
here
said
he
after
riding
two
miles
sir
badgemagus
and
his
squire
came
to
a
hermit
s
house
from
which
a
goodly
knight
rode
forth
to
meet
him
this
knight
was
in
white
armor
horse
and
all
and
he
came
as
fast
as
his
horse
might
run
with
his
spear
in
rest
sir
badgemagus
ran
against
him
with
such
violence
that
he
broke
his
spear
upon
the
white
knight
s
shield
but
the
other
struck
him
so
hard
that
he
broke
his
armor
pierced
him
through
the
shoulder
and
threw
him
from
his
horse
with
that
the
white
knight
alighted
and
took
the
white
shield
from
him
saying
knight
thou
hast
done
a
foolish
act
for
this
shield
ought
not
be
borne
save
by
one
that
shall
have
no
then
he
said
to
the
wounded
knight
s
squire
bear
this
shield
to
the
good
knight
sir
galahad
and
greet
him
well
for
sir
said
the
squire
what
is
your
name
take
no
heed
of
my
name
said
the
white
knight
it
is
not
for
you
to
know
nor
any
earthly
now
fair
sir
said
the
squire
tell
me
why
this
shield
can
not
be
borne
without
injury
to
the
now
since
you
ask
me
said
he
this
shield
belongs
to
no
man
but
sir
then
he
set
the
wounded
man
on
his
horse
and
brought
him
to
the
hermit
s
house
and
laid
him
gently
in
a
bed
where
his
wound
was
dressed
there
he
lay
a
long
time
and
hardly
escaped
with
his
life
sir
galahad
said
the
squire
on
his
return
the
knight
who
wounded
sir
badgemagus
sends
you
greeting
and
bids
you
bear
this
shield
for
through
it
great
adventures
shall
now
blessed
be
god
and
fortune
said
sir
galahad
he
then
put
on
his
armor
mounted
his
horse
hung
the
shield
about
his
neck
and
commended
them
to
god
sir
uwaine
said
that
if
it
pleased
him
he
would
accompany
him
sir
said
sir
galahad
that
can
not
be
for
i
must
ride
after
awhile
he
came
to
the
hermit
s
house
where
he
met
the
white
knight
and
saluted
him
courteously
sir
said
he
this
shield
must
have
seen
many
marvelous
illustration
a
monk
led
him
behind
the
altar
where
the
shield
hung
white
as
snow
but
in
the
center
was
a
red
cross
sir
said
the
knight
the
legend
says
that
thirty
years
after
the
crucifixion
joseph
of
arimathea
the
gentle
knight
who
took
down
our
lord
from
the
cross
departed
from
jerusalem
and
his
people
with
him
and
came
to
a
city
called
sarras
now
evelake
the
king
of
sarras
had
a
war
against
the
saracens
joseph
told
the
king
that
he
would
be
defeated
and
slain
unless
he
gave
up
his
belief
of
the
old
law
and
believed
in
the
new
he
then
showed
him
the
right
belief
to
which
he
agreed
with
all
his
heart
and
this
white
shield
was
made
for
evelake
in
the
name
of
him
who
died
on
the
cross
after
he
had
overcome
his
enemies
with
the
help
of
this
shield
he
was
baptized
and
for
the
most
part
all
the
people
of
the
city
soon
after
this
joseph
departed
from
sarras
and
evelake
with
him
and
so
the
tale
goes
joseph
carried
the
holy
vessel
and
evelake
the
shield
till
by
good
fortune
they
came
into
the
land
of
britain
in
due
time
joseph
lay
on
his
and
evelake
was
full
of
sorrow
and
said
for
thy
love
i
left
my
country
now
since
thou
art
going
out
of
the
world
leave
me
some
token
of
i
will
do
that
gladly
said
joseph
bring
me
the
now
joseph
made
a
cross
on
this
shield
with
his
own
blood
and
said
now
you
may
know
that
i
love
you
for
when
you
see
this
cross
you
shall
think
of
me
for
it
shall
always
be
as
clear
as
it
is
now
and
no
man
shall
bear
this
shield
without
injury
except
the
good
knight
sir
galahad
who
shall
do
many
marvelous
now
know
sir
galahad
that
this
is
the
day
set
for
you
to
have
this
when
he
had
thus
spoken
the
white
knight
vanished
from
his
sight
launcelot
and
sir
percival
attack
sir
thus
equipped
with
a
shield
sir
galahad
set
out
on
his
quest
and
after
many
adventures
found
himself
in
a
vast
forest
there
he
saw
sir
launcelot
and
sir
percival
riding
along
but
neither
knew
him
for
he
had
newly
disguised
himself
sir
launcelot
his
father
at
once
put
his
spear
in
rest
and
rode
at
his
son
sir
galahad
who
struck
so
hard
in
his
own
defense
that
he
threw
both
horse
and
man
then
he
drew
his
sword
to
defend
himself
against
sir
percival
who
now
attacked
him
he
dealt
him
such
a
blow
that
it
broke
his
cap
of
steel
and
if
the
sword
had
not
swerved
sir
percival
might
have
been
slain
as
it
was
he
fell
out
of
his
saddle
these
encounters
took
place
near
the
hermitage
of
a
lady
who
was
a
recluse
when
she
saw
sir
galahad
ride
she
said
god
be
with
you
the
best
knight
of
the
then
she
cried
aloud
so
that
sir
launcelot
and
sir
percival
might
hear
ah
certainly
if
those
two
knights
had
known
thee
as
well
as
i
do
they
would
not
have
dared
the
when
sir
galahad
heard
her
say
this
he
was
much
afraid
of
being
known
so
he
put
spurs
to
his
horse
and
rode
away
at
a
great
pace
then
both
knights
knew
that
it
was
sir
galahad
and
quickly
mounted
their
horses
and
rode
after
him
but
he
was
soon
out
of
their
sight
and
they
turned
back
with
heavy
hearts
let
us
make
inquiry
of
yonder
recluse
said
sir
percival
do
as
you
please
said
sir
launcelot
and
then
rode
headlong
keeping
no
path
but
as
wild
adventure
led
him
and
was
soon
lost
in
the
depths
of
the
forest
but
sir
percival
went
to
the
door
of
the
recluse
who
asked
what
he
wished
madam
he
replied
i
am
a
knight
of
king
arthur
s
court
sir
percival
de
galis
do
you
know
the
knight
with
the
white
shield
when
the
recluse
heard
his
name
she
was
exceeding
glad
for
she
greatly
loved
him
as
she
had
a
right
to
do
for
she
was
an
aunt
of
his
whom
he
had
never
seen
sir
said
she
why
would
you
know
truly
madam
said
he
that
i
may
fight
with
him
for
i
am
ashamed
of
my
ah
sir
percival
said
she
i
see
that
you
have
a
great
will
to
be
slain
as
your
father
was
through
madam
said
he
it
seems
by
your
words
that
you
know
yes
said
she
i
ought
to
know
you
for
i
am
your
then
sir
percival
wept
when
he
knew
who
she
was
ah
fair
nephew
said
she
when
have
you
heard
from
your
mother
truly
said
he
not
in
a
great
while
but
i
often
dream
of
her
in
my
fair
nephew
said
she
your
mother
is
dead
for
after
you
set
out
on
this
quest
she
fell
into
such
sorrow
that
she
soon
now
may
god
have
mercy
on
her
soul
said
he
sadly
for
i
was
sorely
afraid
of
it
but
we
must
all
change
our
life
now
tell
me
fair
aunt
was
that
knight
he
who
bore
the
red
arms
at
pentecost
that
is
he
said
his
aunt
he
is
without
equal
for
he
works
by
miracle
and
can
not
be
overcome
by
the
hands
of
any
earthly
now
madam
said
he
since
i
know
this
i
will
never
have
to
do
with
sir
galahad
except
by
way
of
kindness
tell
me
how
i
may
find
him
for
i
would
much
love
his
fair
nephew
said
she
you
must
ride
to
the
castle
of
goothe
where
his
first
cousin
lives
and
there
you
may
lodge
for
the
night
if
you
get
no
word
of
him
there
ride
straight
to
the
castle
of
carbonek
where
the
crippled
king
lives
and
there
you
will
hear
sir
percival
left
his
aunt
sorrowing
and
rode
till
evensong
when
he
heard
a
clock
strike
then
he
came
upon
a
castle
closed
in
with
high
walls
and
deep
ditches
and
knocked
at
the
gate
but
could
get
no
word
of
sir
galahad
there
he
passed
the
night
and
in
the
morning
departed
and
rode
till
the
hour
of
noon
in
a
valley
he
overtook
a
company
of
about
twenty
men
at
arms
who
bore
a
dead
knight
upon
a
hearse
when
they
saw
sir
percival
they
asked
him
who
he
was
a
knight
of
king
arthur
s
court
he
answered
then
they
cried
all
at
once
kill
him
straightway
sir
percival
struck
the
first
to
the
ground
and
his
horse
upon
him
then
seven
of
them
at
once
ran
at
him
and
threw
him
and
slew
his
horse
now
had
not
the
good
knight
sir
galahad
happened
by
adventure
in
those
parts
they
would
have
killed
or
captured
sir
percival
instantly
but
when
he
saw
so
many
knights
attacking
one
man
he
cried
spare
that
knight
s
life
with
that
he
charged
the
twenty
men
at
arms
as
fast
as
his
horse
might
drive
with
spear
in
rest
and
hurled
the
foremost
horse
and
man
to
the
ground
when
his
spear
was
broken
he
seized
his
sword
and
struck
out
right
and
left
so
that
it
was
a
marvel
to
see
at
every
blow
he
cut
one
down
or
wounded
him
so
that
the
rest
became
frightened
and
fled
into
a
thick
forest
and
sir
galahad
followed
hard
after
them
when
sir
percival
saw
him
chase
them
so
he
knew
it
was
sir
galahad
and
wept
with
rage
for
his
horse
was
dead
he
ran
after
him
afoot
crying
for
him
to
stop
while
he
thanked
him
but
sir
galahad
rode
fast
after
the
knights
he
was
chasing
and
was
soon
out
of
sight
and
as
fast
as
he
could
sir
percival
went
after
him
on
foot
crying
but
could
not
overtake
him
adventure
of
the
gentlewoman
the
mysterious
ship
and
the
sword

the
strange
now
says
the
tale
when
sir
galahad
had
rescued
sir
percival
he
went
into
a
vast
forest
where
he
rode
many
journeys
and
found
many
adventures
one
day
after
many
weary
hours
on
horseback
as
night
was
falling
he
arrived
at
a
lonely
hermitage
and
knocked
the
good
man
was
very
glad
to
welcome
a
and
to
hear
his
tales
and
so
they
talked
till
late
soon
after
they
had
gone
to
rest
there
was
a
knocking
at
the
door
when
the
hermit
asked
who
was
there
a
voice
said
i
am
a
gentlewoman
who
would
speak
with
the
knight
that
is
with
then
the
good
man
awoke
sir
galahad
and
bade
him
arise
and
speak
with
the
gentlewoman
who
said
he
seems
to
have
great
need
of
so
sir
galahad
arose
and
asked
her
wish
sir
galahad
said
she
i
wish
you
to
arm
yourself
mount
your
horse
and
follow
me
and
i
will
show
you
within
three
days
the
highest
adventure
that
any
knight
ever
sir
galahad
took
his
arms
at
once
mounted
his
horse
commended
himself
to
god
and
bade
the
gentlewoman
go
and
he
would
follow
where
she
wished
the
damsel
rode
as
fast
as
her
horse
would
gallop
that
night
and
all
the
next
day
till
they
came
within
reach
of
the
sea
toward
night
they
halted
at
a
castle
that
was
enclosed
with
running
water
and
high
walls
here
sir
galahad
had
great
welcome
for
the
lady
of
the
castle
was
the
damsel
s
lady
when
he
was
unarmed
the
damsel
said
to
the
lady
madam
shall
we
lodge
here
no
said
she
but
only
till
he
has
dined
and
slept
a
so
he
ate
and
slept
till
the
maid
called
him
and
then
armed
himself
by
torchlight
when
the
maid
and
he
were
both
mounted
they
left
the
castle
and
rode
till
they
reached
the
seaside
there
they
found
in
the
darkness
a
ship
awaiting
them
and
two
voices
cried
from
on
shipboard
welcome
sir
galahad
we
have
long
waited
for
when
he
heard
these
words
he
asked
them
who
they
were
sir
said
the
damsel
leave
your
horse
here
and
i
shall
leave
when
they
entered
the
ship
he
was
welcomed
with
great
joy
by
those
whose
voices
he
had
heard
who
were
none
other
than
sir
bors
and
sir
percival
and
he
was
exceeding
glad
of
their
company
as
soon
as
they
were
on
board
the
wind
arose
and
drove
them
through
the
sea
after
a
while
morning
dawned
and
sir
galahad
took
off
his
helmet
and
his
sword
and
asked
his
comrades
where
the
ship
was
from
truly
said
they
you
know
as
well
as
we
but
of
god
s
illustration
the
damsel
rode
as
fast
as
her
horse
would
gallop
that
night
and
all
the
next
day
till
they
came
in
sight
of
the
sea
then
they
told
of
their
adventures
since
they
last
parted
and
of
their
great
temptations
truly
said
sir
galahad
you
are
much
indebted
to
god
for
escaping
great
dangers
and
had
it
not
been
for
this
gentlewoman
i
should
not
have
come
here
for
i
never
thought
to
find
you
in
this
strange
ah
sir
galahad
said
sir
bors
if
your
father
sir
launcelot
were
here
it
seems
to
me
we
should
lack
that
may
not
be
said
he
except
it
please
our
now
neither
sir
percival
nor
sir
bors
knew
the
gentlewoman
for
she
was
veiled
by
this
time
the
ship
was
far
distant
from
the
land
of
britain
and
by
chance
had
arrived
between
two
great
rocks
which
were
exceeding
dangerous
neither
could
they
land
for
there
was
a
great
whirlpool
of
the
sea
after
buffeting
about
they
escaped
the
danger
and
came
into
a
calmer
sea
and
there
saw
another
ship
at
anchor
to
which
they
might
go
in
safety
let
us
go
there
said
the
gentlewoman
and
we
shall
see
adventures
if
our
lord
when
they
came
alongside
they
found
a
fine
ship
but
no
one
appeared
to
be
on
board
on
the
stern
they
read
these
strange
and
dreadful
words
whoever
enters
this
ship
must
be
steadfast
in
his
belief
for
i
am
faith
therefore
beware
for
if
thou
fail
i
shall
not
help
then
the
gentlewoman
asked
do
you
know
who
i
am
truly
said
sir
percival
i
do
not
know
know
well
said
she
i
am
your
sister
the
daughter
of
king
pellinore
therefore
you
are
the
man
in
the
world
i
most
like
if
you
are
not
in
perfect
belief
and
enter
the
ship
you
will
perish
for
it
will
suffer
no
sin
in
now
when
sir
percival
knew
she
was
his
sister
he
was
very
glad
and
said
fair
sister
i
shall
enter
therein
for
if
i
be
worthless
or
an
untrue
knight
there
shall
i
without
further
parley
sir
galahad
stepped
on
board
the
strange
ship
followed
by
the
gentlewoman
sir
bors
and
sir
percival
the
fittings
were
so
rich
and
perfect
that
they
wondered
for
they
had
never
seen
the
like
in
the
cabin
in
the
midst
of
the
ship
there
stood
a
beautiful
bed
with
a
coverlet
of
fine
silk
and
on
it
at
the
foot
lay
a
great
sword
of
marvelous
beauty
which
was
drawn
out
of
its
scabbard
half
a
foot
and
more
as
if
one
had
tried
to
draw
it
and
could
not
here
is
a
mystery
cried
sir
percival
i
shall
attempt
to
handle
the
so
he
tried
to
grasp
it
but
try
as
he
might
he
could
not
now
by
my
faith
said
he
i
have
sir
bors
also
set
his
hand
to
the
sword
and
failed
sir
galahad
looked
at
it
more
closely
and
saw
on
it
letters
as
red
as
blood
which
said
let
him
who
would
draw
me
from
my
scabbard
see
that
he
be
bolder
than
other
men
for
whoso
draweth
me
shall
not
escape
injury
to
his
body
or
wounding
unto
by
my
faith
said
sir
galahad
i
would
like
to
draw
this
sword
out
of
its
scabbard
but
the
penalty
is
so
great
that
i
shall
not
try
sir
said
the
gentlewoman
know
that
all
men
are
warned
against
drawing
this
sword
save
as
they
looked
closer
they
saw
that
the
was
made
of
hempen
cord
of
such
poor
account
that
it
did
not
seem
strong
enough
to
bear
so
heavy
a
weight
the
scabbard
was
of
serpent
s
skin
and
on
it
were
letters
of
gold
and
silver
which
said
whoever
bears
me
as
i
ought
to
be
borne
should
be
bolder
than
other
men
for
the
body
of
him
by
whose
side
i
ought
to
hang
shall
not
suffer
shame
while
he
wears
this
belt
and
no
one
shall
dare
change
this
belt
except
a
maid
who
is
a
king
s
sir
said
the
gentlewoman
to
sir
galahad
there
was
a
king
called
pelleas
the
maimed
king
who
while
he
was
able
to
ride
strongly
supported
christendom
and
the
holy
church
upon
a
day
he
hunted
in
a
wood
which
bordered
the
sea
and
at
last
he
lost
his
hounds
and
his
knights
and
found
this
ship
when
he
saw
the
letters
he
entered
for
he
was
right
perfect
in
his
life
here
he
found
this
sword
and
drew
it
out
as
far
as
you
now
see
with
that
there
entered
a
spear
and
wounded
him
in
both
his
thighs
his
wounds
have
never
healed
and
never
shall
until
we
come
to
him
thus
said
she
was
not
pelleas
your
grandfather
maimed
for
his
boldness
by
my
faith
said
sir
galahad
then
as
they
stood
looking
at
the
bed
in
wonder
sir
percival
lifted
the
coverlet
and
found
a
writing
which
told
of
the
ship
by
whom
it
was
made
and
how
it
came
there
but
that
does
not
belong
to
this
tale
now
said
sir
galahad
where
shall
we
find
the
maid
who
shall
make
a
belt
strong
enough
to
carry
this
sword
fair
sir
said
sir
percival
s
sister
do
not
fear
for
i
shall
show
you
a
belt
fit
for
such
a
she
then
opened
a
box
and
took
out
a
belt
wrought
with
golden
threads
and
set
with
precious
stones
and
a
rich
buckle
of
gold
lo
sirs
said
she
here
is
a
belt
that
ought
to
bear
this
sword
for
the
greatest
part
of
it
is
woven
of
my
own
hair
which
i
loved
full
well
when
i
was
a
woman
of
the
world
but
as
soon
as
i
knew
this
adventure
was
appointed
to
me
i
clipped
off
my
hair
and
made
this
we
are
truly
grateful
said
sir
bors
for
without
your
help
we
should
have
endured
much
the
gentlewoman
then
put
the
new
belt
on
the
sword
now
said
the
three
knights
what
is
the
name
of
the
sword
and
what
shall
we
call
it
truly
said
she
the
sword
of
the
strange
they
then
said
to
sir
galahad
we
pray
you
to
gird
yourself
with
the
sword
which
hath
been
so
long
desired
in
the
land
of
now
let
me
begin
said
sir
galahad
to
grip
this
sword
to
give
you
courage
but
know
that
it
belongs
to
me
no
more
than
it
does
to
he
then
gripped
it
with
his
fingers
and
drew
it
forth
and
sir
percival
s
sister
girded
him
with
the
sword
now
i
care
not
if
i
die
said
she
for
i
have
made
thee
now
the
worthiest
knight
in
the
fair
damsel
said
sir
galahad
you
have
done
so
much
that
i
shall
be
your
knight
all
the
days
of
my
gentlewoman
risks
her
life
for
when
they
had
achieved
the
adventure
of
the
mysterious
sword
they
returned
to
their
own
ship
and
the
wind
arose
and
drove
them
out
to
sea
at
a
great
pace
all
that
day
and
night
they
went
before
the
south
wind
and
on
the
morrow
came
to
the
borders
of
scotland
where
they
were
forced
to
land
for
they
were
without
food
here
after
leaving
the
ship
they
were
attacked
by
wicked
knights
because
they
were
of
king
arthur
s
court
and
had
many
other
adventures
which
are
no
part
of
this
tale
then
on
a
day
all
heard
a
voice
which
said
sir
galahad
thou
hast
well
avenged
me
on
god
s
enemies
now
hasten
to
the
maimed
king
that
he
may
receive
his
health
for
which
he
has
waited
so
on
the
way
they
came
to
a
castle
which
belonged
to
a
gentlewoman
who
had
lain
for
many
years
under
a
strange
malady
which
no
doctor
could
cure
but
an
old
man
had
said
if
she
were
anointed
with
the
blood
of
a
maid
who
is
a
king
s
daughter
she
would
recover
her
now
said
sir
percival
s
sister
when
she
heard
this
fair
knights
i
foresee
that
this
gentlewoman
will
die
unless
she
have
part
of
my
straightway
the
knights
opposed
her
and
sir
galahad
said
certainly
if
ye
bleed
so
much
ye
will
truly
said
she
if
i
die
to
heal
her
i
shall
have
great
honor
and
soul
s
health
and
i
shall
do
it
and
nothing
they
said
could
change
her
the
next
day
after
they
had
heard
service
sir
percival
s
sister
bade
them
bring
the
sick
lady
then
said
she
who
shall
let
my
blood
so
they
brought
a
doctor
who
did
as
she
desired
but
she
bled
so
much
that
the
dish
was
full
and
no
one
could
stop
it
then
she
said
to
the
sick
lady
madam
if
i
come
by
my
death
to
make
you
well
for
god
s
love
pray
for
with
that
she
fell
into
a
swoon
sir
galahad
sir
percival
and
sir
bors
quickly
lifted
her
up
and
tried
to
staunch
her
blood
but
she
had
bled
so
much
that
she
could
not
live
when
she
awoke
out
of
her
swoon
she
said
fair
brother
sir
percival
i
must
die
for
the
healing
of
this
lady
so
i
require
that
you
bury
me
not
in
this
country
but
as
soon
as
i
am
dead
take
me
down
to
the
sea
put
me
in
a
boat
and
let
me
go
as
adventure
will
lead
me
and
as
soon
as
you
three
come
to
the
city
of
sarras
there
to
achieve
the
holy
grail
you
shall
find
me
arrived
under
a
tower
and
there
bury
me
in
the
spiritual
place
for
there
sir
galahad
shall
be
buried
and
you
also
my
brother
in
the
same
when
sir
percival
heard
these
words
he
promised
her
weeping
and
her
soul
departed
from
the
body
as
they
knelt
beside
her
they
again
heard
a
voice
which
said
early
you
three
shall
separate
from
each
other
till
the
adventure
bring
you
to
the
maimed
the
same
day
the
sick
lady
was
healed
but
she
sorrowed
exceedingly
for
the
death
of
the
maiden
sir
percival
wrote
a
letter
telling
how
his
sister
had
helped
them
in
strange
adventures
and
put
it
in
her
right
hand
then
the
knights
carried
her
to
the
sea
and
laid
her
in
a
boat
and
covered
her
with
silk
and
the
wind
arose
and
drove
the
boat
from
the
land
and
they
all
watched
it
till
it
was
lost
to
their
sight
then
they
returned
to
the
castle
and
forthwith
there
fell
a
sudden
tempest
of
thunder
lightning
and
rain
that
shook
the
earth
and
evensong
was
passed
ere
the
tempest
ceased
on
the
morrow
the
three
knights
separated
and
each
went
his
own
way
galahad
meets
a
knight
in
white
the
story
says
that
after
sir
launcelot
rode
into
the
forest
after
sir
galahad
and
was
lost
he
escaped
many
perils
but
at
last
came
to
the
water
of
morteise
as
the
night
was
falling
not
knowing
what
to
do
he
lay
down
to
sleep
and
await
what
adventure
god
would
send
him
when
he
was
asleep
he
heard
a
voice
in
a
dream
which
said
launcelot
rise
up
take
thine
armor
and
enter
the
first
ship
thou
shalt
when
he
heard
these
words
he
rose
up
and
set
out
toward
the
sea
by
good
fortune
he
found
a
ship
which
was
without
sail
and
oars
and
he
saw
no
one
as
soon
as
he
was
on
shipboard
he
was
filled
with
joy
such
as
he
had
never
felt
before
and
in
this
joy
he
lay
down
and
slept
till
daylight
when
he
awoke
he
was
astonished
to
see
there
a
fair
bed
in
which
lay
a
dead
gentlewoman
as
he
looked
he
saw
in
her
right
hand
sir
percival

letter
which
told
who
she
was
and
what
she
had
achieved
there
sir
launcelot

some
days
not
knowing
what
to
do
one
night
as
he
was
sitting
on
the
shore
he
heard
a
horseman
coming
that
way
and
waited
to
see
what
would
happen
the
rider
who
seemed
to
be
a
knight
rode
to
where
the
ship
was
alighted
and
went
on
board

launcelot
went
toward
him
and
said

his
salute
and
asked

of
me
in
this
ah
are
you
sir
galahad
yes
in
with
that
sir
galahad
leaped
to
the
shore
kneeled
down
and
asked
sir
launcelot
s
blessing
and
then
took
off
his
helmet
and
kissed
him
with
great
joy
they
told
of
the
marvels
and
adventures
that
had
happened
to
them
since
they
left
the
court
sir
galahad
told
of
the
high
honor
of
sir
percival
s
sister
that
she
was
the
best
maid
living
and
that
her
death
was
a
great
pity
when
sir
launcelot
heard
how
the
marvelous
sword
was
gotten
he
asked
to
see
it
and
kissed
the
hilt
and
the
scabbard
truly
said
he
i
never
heard
of
such
high
and
strange
adventures
so
sir
launcelot
and
sir
galahad
spent
many
days
together
in
the
ship
and
served
god
daily
and
nightly
with
all
their
power
and
often
the
ship
carried
them
to
far
islands
where
they
met
with
many
strange
and
perilous
adventures
upon
a
monday
it
happened
that
they
landed
at
the
edge
of
a
forest
which
was
by
the
sea
standing
by
a
cross
of
stone
they
saw
a
knight
on
horseback
armed
all
in
white
who
held
by
his
right
hand
a
white
horse
he
came
to
the
ship
saluted
the
two
knights
and
said
sir
galahad
you
have
been
with
your
father
long
enough
leap
upon
this
horse
and
ride
where
adventure
shall
lead
in
quest
of
the
holy
sir
galahad
turned
to
his
father
and
kissed
him
full
courteously
and
said
father
i
do
not
know
that
i
shall
see
you
again
till
i
find
the
holy
i
pray
you
said
sir
launcelot
that
you
will
pray
our
father
in
heaven
to
keep
me
in
his
sir
galahad
mounted
his
horse
and
then
they
all
heard
a
voice
that
said
think
to
do
well
for
the
one
shall
never
see
the
other
till
the
dreadful
day
of
now
my
son
sir
galahad
said
sir
launcelot
since
we
shall
never
see
each
other
again
i
pray
the
high
father
of
heaven
to
preserve
both
you
and
sir
said
sir
galahad
no
prayer
avails
so
much
as
so
saying
he
rode
into
the
forest
and
his
father
saw
him
no
more
the
knight
in
white
armor
then
vanished
as
he
came
and
sir
launcelot
returned
to
the
ship
and
the
wind
arose
and
drove
him
many
days
across
the
sea
to
a
distant
land
soon
after
that
he
left
the
ship
which
kept
on
its
lonely
journey
until
at
last
it
arrived
at
the
city
of
sarras
with
its
fair
burden
now
sir
launcelot
began
to
long
for
the
realm
of
britain
which
he
had
not
seen
for
a
year
and
more
so
commending
himself
to
god
he
rode
through
many
countries
and
came
at
last
to
camelot
here
he
found
king
arthur
and
queen
guinevere
but
many
of
the
knights
of
the
round
table
were
missing
for
already
more
than
half
of
them
had
been
slain
however
sir
gawain
sir
ector
and
sir
lionel
had
returned
and
many
others
who
had
failed
in
their
quest
of
the
holy
grail
all
the
court
was
exceedingly
glad
to
see
sir
launcelot
who
told
of
his
adventures
since
he
had
departed
and
also
those
of
sir
galahad
sir
percival
and
sir
bors
which
he
knew
by
the
letter
of
the
dead
gentlewoman
and
from
sir
galahad
himself
now
would
god
said
the
king
that
all
three
were
that
can
not
be
said
sir
launcelot
for
two
of
them
you
shall
never
see
but
one
of
them
shall
come
galahad
achieves
his
quest
and
bears
the
holy
grail
across
the
now
after
sir
galahad
bade
his
father
farewell
and
entered
the
forest
he
rode
many
journeys
in
vain
at
last
he
found
his
way
out
of
the
forest
and
rode
five
days
toward
the
castle
of
the
maimed
king
and
ever
sir
percival
followed
after
till
he
overtook
him
and
they
went
on
in
company
at
a
crossroads
they
met
sir
bors
who
was
riding
alone
and
so
to
their
great
joy
the
three
knights
were
together
again
in
more
than
a
year
and
half
said
sir
bors
i
have
not
slept
ten
times
in
a
bed
only
in
wild
forests
and
mountains
but
god
was
always
with
thus
they
rode
a
long
time
till
they
came
to
the
castle
of
carbonek
where
lived
pelleas
the
maimed
king
who
was
the
grandfather
of
sir
galahad
when
they
entered
the
castle
hall
a
bed
was
brought
in
whereon
lay
the
good
old
man
they
had
come
so
far
to
see
king
pelleas
was
very
happy
for
he
knew
that
the
quest
of
the
holy
grail
was
about
to
be
achieved
sir
galahad
said
he
lifting
up
his
head
you
are
welcome
for
i
have
long
prayed
for
your
coming
but
now
i
trust
that
my
suffering
shall
be
eliazar
king
pelleas
son
then
brought
the
broken
sword
with
which
joseph
was
wounded
in
the
thigh
after
he
came
to
britain
sir
bors
took
the
two
pieces
and
tried
to
force
them
together
again
but
he
could
not
then
sir
percival
tried
but
he
had
no
more
power
than
sir
bors
now
it
is
your
turn
said
they
to
sir
galahad
for
if
an
earthly
man
can
achieve
it
you
sir
galahad
then
took
the
pieces
and
set
them
together
and
the
sword
seemed
as
if
it
had
just
been
forged
and
never
broken
when
they
recovered
from
their
astonishment
they
gave
the
sword
to
sir
bors
for
he
was
a
good
knight
and
a
worthy
man
a
little
before
evening
a
strange
thing
happened
the
sword
became
wondrously
heated
so
that
no
one
could
handle
it
and
a
voice
was
heard
which
said
they
that
ought
not
to
sit
at
the
table
of
our
lord
arise
for
now
shall
true
knights
be
so
all
went
out
save
king
pelleas
and
his
son
and
a
maid
who
was
his
niece
and
the
three
knights
and
a
table
of
silver
was
before
them
with
the
holy
vessel
covered
with
a
cloth
of
silk
with
that
they
saw
nine
knights
all
armed
come
in
at
the
hall
door
who
took
off
their
armor
and
said
to
sir
galahad
sir
we
have
ridden
hard
to
be
with
you
at
this
you
are
welcome
said
he
but
whence
come
you
three
of
them
said
they
were
from
gaul
three
from
ireland
and
three
from
denmark
upon
that
a
voice
said
let
those
among
you
who
are
not
in
quest
of
the
holy
grail
so
king
pelleas
and
his
son
and
niece
departed
as
the
knights
sat
waiting
it
seemed
to
them
that
there
appeared
a
man
from
heaven
before
the
table
on
which
the
holy
grail
was
and
they
saw
letters
in
his
forehead
which
said
this
is
joseph
the
first
bishop
of
christendom
whom
our
lord
rescued
in
the
city
of
with
him
were
angels
who
bore
a
spear
which
bled
marvelously
then
the
knights
wondered
for
joseph
had
died
more
than
three
hundred
years
before
oh
knights
said
he
wonder
not
for
at
one
time
i
was
an
earthly
man
now
shall
ye
have
such
food
as
never
knights
when
he
had
said
this
he
and
the
angels
vanished
and
they
sat
there
in
great
dread
then
they
looked
and
saw
as
it
were
another
man
enter
who
said
my
knights
and
my
servants
who
are
come
out
of
this
earthly
life
ye
shall
now
see
a
part
of
my
secrets
and
my
hidden
then
he
took
the
holy
vessel
and
proffered
it
to
sir
galahad
who
kneeled
down
and
partook
and
so
after
him
all
the
knights
galahad
said
he
dost
thou
know
what
i
hold
in
my
hands
nay
said
sir
galahad
unless
ye
tell
this
said
he
is
the
holy
vessel
in
which
i
ate
the
last
supper
but
thou
hast
not
seen
it
openly
as
thou
shalt
see
it
in
the
city
of
sarras
therefore
thou
must
go
hence
and
bear
this
vessel
with
thee
this
night
it
shall
depart
from
the
realm
of
britain
to
be
seen
no
more
for
it
is
not
honored
as
it
ought
to
be
by
the
people
of
this
land
who
are
turned
to
evil
living
therefore
go
down
to
the
sea
where
you
shall
find
a
ship
ready
and
with
you
take
the
sword
with
the
strange
belt
and
sir
bors
and
sir
percival
also
i
will
that
ye
take
the
blood
of
the
spear
and
anoint
the
maimed
king
and
he
shall
have
his
then
he
gave
them
his
blessing
and
vanished
away
sir
galahad
went
at
once
to
the
spear
which
lay
on
the
table
and
touched
the
blood
with
his
fingers
and
came
to
his
grandfather
the
maimed
king
and
anointed
him
immediately
he
stood
upon
his
feet
a
whole
man
and
gave
thanks
for
his
healing
that
same
night
about
midnight
they
heard
a
voice
that
said
go
ye
hence
as
i
bade
lord
we
thank
thee
said
they
now
may
we
prove
ourselves
in
all
haste
they
took
their
armor
ready
to
depart
now
the
three
knights
of
gaul
were
great
gentlemen
and
sir
galahad
said
to
them
if
you
come
to
king
arthur
s
court
i
pray
you
salute
my
father
sir
launcelot
and
all
the
company
of
the
round
table
and
they
promised
to
do
so
sir
galahad
sir
percival
and
sir
bors
then
departed
and
rode
three
days
till
they
came
to
the
seashore
and
found
their
ship
when
they
went
on
board
they
saw
the
table
of
silver
and
the
holy
grail
covered
with
a
cloth
of
red
silk
and
were
exceeding
glad
to
have
them
in
their
keeping
now
on
the
voyage
sir
galahad
spent
a
long
time
in
prayer
asking
that
he
might
pass
out
of
this
world
he
prayed
so
earnestly
that
at
last
a
voice
said
to
him
galahad
thou
shalt
have
thy
sir
percival
heard
this
and
asked
him
why
he
prayed
for
such
things
that
shall
i
tell
you
said
he
the
other
day
when
we
saw
part
of
our
adventures
of
the
holy
grail
i
was
filled
with
such
joy
as
i
supposed
no
earthly
man
could
feel
therefore
i
know
well
that
when
my
body
is
dead
my
soul
shall
have
the
great
joy
of
then
he
lay
down
and
slept
a
great
while
and
when
he
awoke
he
saw
before
him
the
city
of
sarras
and
as
they
were
about
to
land
they
saw
the
ship
in
which
sir
percival
had
put
his
sister
truly
said
sir
percival
well
has
my
sister
kept
her
they
first
took
out
of
their
ship
the
table
of
silver
and
the
holy
vessel
and
sir
percival
and
sir
bors
went
before
and
sir
galahad
behind
at
the
city
gate
they
saw
a
crooked
old
man
then
sir
galahad
called
him
and
bade
him
help
bear
the
heavy
table
truly
said
the
old
man
for
ten
years
i
have
not
been
able
to
walk
without
care
not
said
sir
galahad
rise
up
and
show
thy
good
on
getting
up
he
found
himself
whole
as
he
ever
was
so
he
ran
and
took
hold
with
sir
galahad
at
once
the
report
spread
that
a
cripple
had
been
cured
by
a
strange
knight
that
had
entered
the
city
the
three
knights
then
returned
to
the
water
and
brought
sir
percival
s
sister
into
the
spiritual
place
and
buried
her
richly
as
a
king
s
daughter
ought
to
be
when
the
king
of
the
city
who
was
called
estorause
saw
the
three
comrades
he
asked
them
who
they
were
and
what
they
brought
upon
the
table
of
silver
and
they
told
him
the
truth
of
the
holy
grail
now
the
king
was
a
tyrant
of
heathen
birth
and
he
took
them
and
put
them
in
prison
in
a
deep
hole
at
the
year
s
end
king
estorause
fell
sick
and
knew
that
he
would
die
then
he
sent
for
the
three
knights
and
asked
pardon
for
what
he
had
done
and
they
forgave
him
freely
and
so
he
died
when
the
king
was
dead
all
the
city
was
disheartened
and
knew
not
who
might
be
their
king
as
they
were
in
council
there
came
a
voice
that
bade
them
choose
the
youngest
of
the
three
knights
so
they
made
sir
galahad
king
with
the
assent
of
all
the
people
of
the
city
his
first
act
was
to
have
made
a
chest
of
gold
and
precious
stones
to
cover
the
holy
vessel
and
every
morning
the
three
comrades
came
to
the
palace
where
it
was
kept
and
said
their
devotions
passing
of
sir
galahad
the
end
of
sir
percival
and
the
return
of
sir
bors
to
now
after
sir
galahad
had
been
king
a
year
the
three
friends
rose
early
as
was
their
custom
and
came
to
the
palace
and
saw
the
holy
vessel
and
a
man
kneeling
there
who
had
about
him
a
great
company
of
angels
he
called
sir
galahad
and
said
come
forth
good
and
faithful
servant
and
thou
shalt
see
what
thou
hast
much
desired
to
then
sir
galahad
began
to
tremble
greatly
for
he
knew
his
time
had
come
now
said
the
good
man
knowest
thou
who
i
am
nay
said
sir
galahad
i
am
joseph
of
arimathea
whom
our
lord
sent
here
to
bear
thee
fellowship
for
thou
art
like
me
more
than
any
other
in
two
things
one
is
thou
hast
seen
the
holy
grail
and
the
other
is
thou
hast
been
a
blameless
knight
as
i
when
he
had
said
these
words
sir
galahad
went
to
sir
percival
and
sir
bors
and
kissed
them
and
commended
them
to
god
and
said
salute
me
to
my
father
sir
launcelot
as
soon
as
ye
see
him
and
bid
him
remember
this
unstable
he
then
kneeled
before
the
table
and
prayed
and
suddenly
his
soul
departed
and
a
great
company
of
angels
bore
his
soul
up
to
heaven
and
his
two
friends
saw
a
hand
take
the
holy
vessel
and
bear
it
up
to
heaven
since
then
no
man
has
ever
been
so
bold
as
to
say
that
he
had
seen
the
holy
grail
when
sir
percival
and
sir
bors
saw
sir
galahad
dead
they
sorrowed
as
much
as
ever
did
two
men
and
if
they
had
not
been
good
men
they
might
easily
have
fallen
into
despair
and
the
people
of
the
city
sorrowed
with
them
as
soon
as
sir
galahad
was
buried
sir
percival
retired
to
a
hermitage
outside
the
city
and
sir
bors
was
always
with
him
thus
sir
percival
lived
a
year
and
two
months
and
then
passed
out
of
this
world
and
sir
bors
buried
him
by
his
sister
and
sir
galahad
in
the
spiritual
place
now
when
sir
bors
saw
that
he
was
alone
in
a
far
country
as
far
away
as
babylon
he
took
his
armor
and
departed
from
sarras
and
entered
a
ship
and
so
at
last
came
to
the
realm
of
britain
and
to
camelot
where
king
arthur
was
on
his
return
there
was
great
rejoicing
at
the
court
for
they
thought
that
he
was
dead
he
had
been
so
long
out
of
the
country
then
king
arthur
sent
for
the
best
clerks
to
make
a
chronicle
of
the
adventures
of
the
good
knights
sir
bors
told
of
sir
percival
and
his
sister
and
of
sir
galahad
and
the
holy
grail
sir
launcelot
told
what
he
had
seen
and
all
the
tales
were
written
in
great
books
and
put
in
the
armory
at
salisbury
sir
bors
said
to
sir
launcelot
sir
galahad
your
son
saluted
you
by
me
and
after
you
king
arthur
and
all
the
court
and
so
did
sir
percival
for
i
buried
them
with
mine
own
hands
in
the
far
city
of
sarras
also
sir
launcelot
sir
galahad
bids
you
remember
this
unstable
world
as
ye
promised
when
ye
were
together
more
than
half
a
that
is
true
said
sir
launcelot
now
i
trust
to
god
his
prayer
shall
avail
then
sir
launcelot

sir
said
he
i
will
as
ye
sir
galahad
was
not
the
only
knight
who
found
the
holy
grail
added
the
story
lady
after
a
pause
but
i
thought
from
the
story
said
mary
frances
that
sir
galahad
and
his
two
comrades
were
the
only
ones
who
were
permitted
to
find
no
there
were
others
said
the
story
lady
your
own
american
poet
james
russell
lowell
tells
of
another
sir
launfal
who
found
the
grail
in
a
place
he
had
never
thought
to
the
story
people
listened
eagerly
for
they
liked
the
tale
of
sir
galahad
so
much
that
they
were
ready
for
more
so
the
story
lady
told
the
tale
of
a
fourth
knight
who
succeeded
xxvi
how
sir
launfal
achieved
the
holy
grail
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
young
knight
sir
launfal
who
had
read
of
the
success
of
sir
galahad
and
of
the
failure
of
many
of
the
knights
of
the
round
table
this
made
him
very
eager
to
try
his
fortune
so
he
vowed
that
some
day
he
too
would
set
out
in
quest
of
the
holy
grail
now
sir
launfal
lived
in
a
cold
gray
castle
in
the
north
country
whose
gates
were
never
opened
save
to
knights
or
ladies
of
high
degree
who
were
as
proud
and
haughty
as
himself
one
beautiful
june
day
sir
launfal
was
in
the
happy
mood
which
often
comes
to
people
after
the
passing
of
a
cold
bleak
winter
a
day
when
it
seems
easy
for
the
grass
to
be
green
the
sky
to
be
blue
and
the
heart
to
be
brave
on
this
lovely
day
sir
launfal
remembered
his
vow
and
called
his
squire
and
said
bring
me
my
best
armor
and
my
golden
spurs
and
get
my
horse
ready
for
i
shall
set
out
over
land
and
sea
in
quest
of
the
holy
when
the
squire
brought
his
shining
armor
the
knight
put
it
on
and
said
to
himself
i
will
never
sleep
in
a
bed
nor
lay
my
head
on
a
soft
pillow
till
i
have
performed
my
with
that
he
lay
down
in
the
tall
grasses
by
the
brook
his
golden
spurs
by
his
side
to
think
and
plan
what
he
would
do
slowly
his
eyelids
closed
slowly
sleep
came
upon
him
and
he
dreamed
and
this
was
his
dream
it
is
summer
the
crows
flap
their
wings
and
fly
by
twos
and
threes
overhead
in
the
deep
blue
sky
the
cattle
stand
in
the
shallow
brook
and
the
water
runs
along
with
a
sweet
gurgling
music
the
little
birds
sing
in
the
branches
of
the
trees
as
if
trying
to
burst
their
throats
telling
of
the
joy
of
living
even
the
leaves
seem
to
sing
on
the
trees
the
earth
is
so
beautiful
and
gay
but
the
castle
stands
encircled
by
its
high
walls
and
deep
ditch
full
of
water
proud
haughty
and
forbidding
untouched
by
the
loveliness
round
about
it
the
drawbridge
drops
over
the
water
with
a
surly
clang
and
through
the
dark
arch
across
the
bridge
springs
a
charger
bearing
sir
launfal
dressed
in
his
gilded
armor
which
gleams
brightly
in
the
sun
he
is
setting
forth
wherever
adventure
may
lead
him
in
quest
of
the
holy
grail
just
as
he
passes
out
he
is
aware
of
a
beggar
who
sits
crouching
by
the
dark
gate
the
beggar
is
a
leper
he
holds
out
his
hands
and
begs
an
alms
the
sight
of
so
much
misery
fills
the
young
knight
with
loathing
but
he
scornfully
tosses
him
a
piece
of
gold
and
rides
on
strange
to
say
the
beggar
leaves
the
gold
on
the
ground
and
says
better
turn
away
empty
from
the
rich
man
s
door
and
take
the
poor
man
s
crust
and
his
blessing
than
such
a
worthless
gift
as
now
the
scene
changes
it
is
winter
there
are
no
leaves
on
the
bushes
and
trees
the
bare
boughs
rattle
shudderingly
as
the
winds
sweep
through
them
the
brook
is
frozen
over
and
the
cattle
are
huddled
in
their
stalls
a
single
crow
sits
high
up
in
a
in
the
wintry
sunlight
and
the
cold
snow
covers
the
ground
at
the
castle
gate
stands
a
bent
old
man
worn
out
and
frail
the
wind
rustles
through
his
wiry
gray
hair
and
blows
through
his
ragged
clothing
he
peers
eagerly
through
the
window
slits
at
the
joyous
scene
within
for
it
is
christmas
time
and
then
turns
away
illustration
slowly
sleep
came
upon
him
and
he
dreamed
the
bent
old
man
is
sir
launfal
after
many
weary
years
he
has
returned
to
his
castle
disappointed
for
he
has
not
found
the
holy
grail
and
another
heir
who
thinks
him
long
dead
rules
in
his
place
he
sinks
down
by
the
gate
and
his
mind
wanders
he
sees
again
the
scenes
of
the
desert
the
camels
as
they
pass
over
the
hot
sands
the
vain
search
of
the
caravan
for
water
and
then
the
slender
necklace
of
grass
about
the
little
spring
as
it
leaps
and
laughs
in
the
shade
suddenly
he
hears
a
voice
for
christ
s
sweet
sake
i
beg
an
sir
launfal
is
startled
and
looks
around
him
there
at
his
side
he
sees
the
leper
cowering
more
wretched
more
miserable
more
loathsome
than
before
but
he
does
not
look
at
him
in
scorn
this
time
instead
he
says
i
will
share
with
you
the
little
that
i
have
for
in
giving
to
you
i
shall
be
giving
to
him
who
has
given
so
much
for
so
he
divides
his
crust
of
coarse
bread
and
gives
half
to
the
beggar
and
he
goes
to
the
brook
breaks
open
the
ice
and
gives
him
a
drink
of
water
from
his
wooden
bowl
then
suddenly
a
light
shines
round
about
the
place
and
the
leper
no
longer
crouches
at
his
side
but
stands
a
glorified
figure
who
says
lo
it
is
i
be
not
afraid
in
many
climes
without
avail
thou
hast
spent
thy
life
for
the
holy
grail
behold
it
is
here
this
cup
which
thou
did
st
fill
at
the
streamlet
for
me
but
now
this
crust
is
my
body
broken
for
thee
this
water
his
blood
that
died
on
the
tree
not
what
we
give
but
what
we
share
for
the
gift
without
the
giver
is
bare
who
gives
himself
with
his
alms
feeds
three
himself
his
hungering
neighbor
and
sir
launfal
awoke
sat
up
and
rubbed
his
eyes
and
looked
about
him
here
were
the
tall
grasses
the
brook
the
cattle
just
as
he
had
left
them
when
he
went
to
sleep
and
dreamed
he
was
not
in
rags
and
tatters
but
was
a
young
knight
clad
in
gleaming
armor
his
spurs
at
his
feet
it
was
not
winter
but
a
beautiful
june
day
with
birds
flying
about
singing
songs
of
gladness
and
cattle
browsing
in
the
meadows
sir
launfal
quickly
arose
and
made
his
way
into
the
great
hall
of
the
castle
where
every
one
met
him
with
surprise
why
sir
knight
said
his
sister
we
thought
by
now
you
would
be
far
on
your
journey
in
quest
of
the
holy
i
have
found
it
cried
sir
launfal
here
at
my
castle
gate
then
he
laid
aside
his
arms
and
said
to
his
squire
hang
these
idle
weapons
upon
the
walls
and
let
the
spiders
weave
their
webs
about
them
whoever
would
find
the
holy
grail
must
wear
another
sort
of
armor
the
armor
of
unselfish
now
the
castle
gates
stand
wide
open
and
those
in
need
are
as
welcome
there
as
the
birds
in
the
s
branches
no
matter
what
the
weather
outside
it
is
summer
in
the
castle
the
year
round
for
hearts
are
happy
in
giving
and
sharing
the
great
blessings
there
bestowed
and
the
happiest
of
all
is
the
good
knight
himself
so
you
see
sir
launfal
found
the
holy
grail
and
he
did
something
even
better
said
the
story
lady
as
she
finished
the
tale
he
showed
others
how
to
find
the
stories
of
the
fourth
day
music
ann
catches
a
john
and
margaret
paton
among
the
strange
robert
of
the
man
without
a
your
flag
and
my
flag
the
stories
of
the
fourth
day
xxvii
music
bewitched
when
all
the
story
people
were
assembled
the
story
king
in
his
place
mary
frances
in
the
blue
velvet
chair
beside
the
story
queen
the
ready
writer
with
pen
upraised
the
story
lady
began
we
have
six
short
stories
the
first
is
about
a
school
boy
named
bob
and
how
he
conquered
his
worst
s
three
thud
thud
thud
hit
him
in
the
eye
knock
the
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
ha
ha
there
goes
his
nose
i
hit
him
that
time
these
dreadful
sounds
seemed
to
say
that
some
barbarous
piece
of
cruelty
was
going
on
but
the
victim
was
only
a
which
the
boys
of
strappington
school
had
set
up
in
their
playground
truth
to
tell
the
did
not
like
it
much
but
boys
can
not
be
expected
to
understand
the
feelings
of
a
so
he
bore
it
very
patiently
and
when
one
snowball
came
in
each
eye
and
a
third
in
his
mouth
he
never
spoke
a
word
or
flinched
a
muscle
but
how
was
the
schoolmaster
to
know
that
it
was
only
a
and
what
was
more
natural
than
that
he
should
peep
over
the
playground
wall
to
see
what
was
going
on
and
how
was
little
ralph
ruddy
to
know
that
the
schoolmaster
was
there
and
how
was
he
to
know
that
the
snowball
which
was
meant
for
the
s
pipe
would
land
itself
on
the
schoolmaster
s
nose
oh
the
horror
that
seized
upon
the
school
at
that
dire
event
and
the
dead
silence
that
reigned
in
that
playground
for
those
were
the
good
old
times
of
long
ago
when
anything
that
went
wrong
was
set
right
with
a
birch
rod
little
ralph
ruddy
knew
only
too
well
what
was
coming
when
the
angry
schoolmaster
ordered
him
into
the
schoolroom
the
of
course
was
left
in
the
playground
all
alone
he
saw
the
boys
troop
indoors
and
heard
some
angry
words
and
some
cries
of
pain
and
saw
poor
little
ralph
thrust
into
the
cold
playground
and
heard
the
door
slam
behind
him
and
stared
without
once
turning
his
head
or
blinking
his
eyes
while
the
little
fellow
sat
on
the
snowy
doorstep
with
a
knuckle
screwed
into
each
eye
and
indeed
the
good
himself
felt
half
inclined
to
cry
only
the
tears
froze
inside
before
they
got
out
of
his
eyes
so
he
couldn
t
when
the
bell
rang
at
four
o
clock
the
boys
came
out
and
among
them
bob
hardy
the
son
of
a
poor
farm
laborer
a
cruel
shame
i
call
it
muttered
bob
to
whip
a
little
chap
like
that
and
then
shut
him
out
in
the
cold
i
told
him
ralph
ruddy
never
meant
to
do
it
and
then
he
caned
me
as
well
a
real
brute
i
call
him
and
i
ll
pay
him
out
too
i
declare
i
ll
break
his
bedroom
windows
this
very
night
and
let
him
try
how
he
likes
the
winter
wind
and
bob
meant
to
do
it
too
he
climbed
out
of
the
cottage
window
when
all
were
asleep
and
made
his
way
down
to
the
schoolhouse
by
moonlight
with
a
pocketfull
of
stones
and
climbed
the
wall
of
the
playground
and
stood
there
all
ready
to
open
fire
when
a
voice
startled
him
a
sort
of
shivering
whisper
better
not
bob
better
wait
a
bit
said
the
voice
bob
dropped
the
stone
and
looked
about
but
there
was
no
one
near
except
the
shining
weirdly
in
the
pale
moonlight
however
the
words
whoever
spoke
them
set
bob
a
thinking
and
instead
of
breaking
the
schoolmaster
s
windows
he
went
home
again
and
got
into
bed
that
was
in
january
and
when
january
was
done
february
came
as
happens
in
most
years
february
brought
good
fortune
at
least
bob
s
mother
said
so
for
she
got
a
job
as
charwoman
at
the
squire
s
for
which
she
was
well
paid
it
did
not
turn
out
so
very
well
though
after
all
for
the
butler
said
she
stole
a
silver
spoon
and
told
the
squire
so
and
if
the
butler
could
have
proved
what
he
said
the
squire
would
have
sent
her
to
prison
only
he
could
not
so
she
got
off
and
bob
s
mother
declared
that
she
had
no
doubt
the
butler
took
the
spoon
himself
all
right
said
bob
to
himself
i
ll
try
the
strength
of
my
new
oaken
stick
across
that
butler
s
and
he
meant
it
too
for
that
very
evening
he
shouldered
his
cudgel
and
tramped
away
to
the
big
house
and
when
he
got
there
the
door
stood
wide
open
so
in
he
walked
now
there
hung
in
the
hall
the
portrait
of
a
queer
old
lady
in
a
stiff
frill
and
a
long
waist
and
an
hoop
petticoat
and
when
bob
entered
the
house
what
should
this
old
lady
do
but
shake
her
head
at
him
to
be
sure
there
was
only
a
flickering
lamp
in
the
entry
and
bob
thought
at
first
it
must
have
been
the
dim
light
and
his
own
fancy
so
he
went
striding
through
the
hall
with
his
cudgel
in
his
hand
better
not
bob
said
the
old
lady
better
wait
a
bit
why
they
won
t
let
me
do
anything
grumbled
bob
but
he
went
home
without
thrashing
the
butler
all
the
same
that
was
in
february
you
know
well
when
february
was
done
march
came
and
with
it
came
greater
than
ever
for
bob
s
father
was
driving
his
master
s
horse
and
cart
to
market
when
what
should
jump
out
of
the
ditch
but
old
nanny
jones
s
donkey
an
ugly
beast
at
the
best
of
times
and
enough
to
frighten
any
horse
but
what
must
the
brute
do
on
this
occasion
but
set
up
a
terrific
braying
which
sent
farmer
thornycroft
s
new
horse
nearly
out
of
his
wits
so
that
he
backed
the
cart
and
all
that
was
in
it
including
bob
s
father
into
the
ditch
a
pretty
sight
they
looked
there
for
the
horse
was
sitting
where
the
driver
ought
to
be
and
bob
s
father
was
seated
much
against
his
wish
in
a
large
basket
full
of
eggs
with
his
legs
sticking
out
one
side
and
his
head
the
other
of
course
farmer
thornycroft
did
not
like
to
lose
his
eggs
who
would
for
even
the
most
obliging
hens
can
not
be
persuaded
to
lay
an
extra
number
in
order
to
make
up
for
those
that
are
broken
but
for
all
that
farmer
thornycroft
had
no
right
to
lay
all
the
blame
on
bob
s
father
and
stop
two
shillings
out
of
his
week
s
wage
so
bob
s
father
protested
and
that
made
farmer
thornycroft
angry
and
then
since
fire
kindles
fire
bob
s
father
grew
angry
too
and
called
the
farmer
a
cruel
brute
so
the
farmer
dismissed
him
and
gave
him
no
wages
at
all
we
can
hardly
be
surprised
that
when
bob
heard
of
all
this
he
felt
a
trifle
out
of
sorts
but
the
desire
for
vengeance
which
he
felt
could
hardly
be
justified
he
went
pelting
over
the
fields
and
all
the
way
he
went
he
muttered
to
himself
a
cruel
shame
i
call
it
but
i
ll
pay
him
out
i
mean
to
let
his
sheep
out
of
the
pen
and
then
i
will
just
go
and
tell
him
that
i
ve
done
now
the
field
just
before
you
come
to
farmer
thornycroft
s
was
sown
with
spring
wheat
and
they
had
put
up
a
scarecrow
there
to
frighten
the
birds
away
the
scarecrow
was
very
much
down
in
the
world
his
coat
had
no
buttons
and
his
hat
had
no
brim
and
his
trousers
had
only
a
leg
and
a
half
his
relations
in
the
tailors
windows
would
not
have
cared
to
meet
him
in
the
street
at
all
but
even
the
ragged
and
unfortunate
have
their
feelings
and
the
scarecrow
was
truly
sorry
to
see
bob
scouring
across
the
field
in
such
a
temper
so
just
as
bob
passed
him
he
flapped
out
at
him
with
one
sleeve
and
the
boy
turned
sharply
round
to
see
who
it
was
only
a
scarecrow
said
he
blown
about
by
the
wind
and
went
on
his
way
but
as
he
went
strange
to
say
he
heard
or
thought
he
heard
a
voice
call
after
him
better
not
bob
better
wait
a
bit
so
bob
went
home
again
and
never
let
the
sheep
astray
after
all
but
he
thought
it
very
hard
that
he
might
not
punish
either
the
schoolmaster
or
the
butler
or
the
farmer
pan
s
now
the
folk
that
hide
behind
the
shadows
thought
well
of
bob
for
his
and
they
determined
that
they
would
work
for
him
and
make
all
straight
again
so
when
bob
went
down
to
the
river
side
next
day
and
took
out
his
knife
to
cut
some
reeds
for
father
pan
breathed
upon
the
reeds
and
enchanted
them
what
a
breeze
exclaimed
bob
but
he
knew
nothing
at
all
of
what
had
in
reality
happened
bob
finished
his
and
trudged
along
and
whistled
on
them
to
his
heart
s
content
when
he
got
to
the
village
he
was
surprised
to
see
a
little
girl
begin
to
dance
to
his
tune
and
then
another
little
girl
and
then
another
bob
was
so
astonished
that
he
left
off
playing
and
stood
looking
at
them
with
wonder
but
so
soon
as
ever
he
left
off
playing
the
little
girls
ceased
to
dance
and
as
soon
as
they
had
recovered
their
breath
they
began
to
beg
him
not
to
play
again
for
the
they
were
sure
must
be
bewitched
ho
ho
cried
bob
here
s
a
pretty
game
i
ll
just
give
the
schoolmaster
a
turn
come
that
will
not
do
him
any
harm
at
any
rate
strange
to
say
at
that
very
moment
the
schoolmaster
came
along
the
street
toot
toot
toot
tweedle
tweedle
toot
went
the
and
away
went
the
schoolmaster
s
legs
cutting
such
capers
as
the
world
never
looked
upon
before
gayly
trudged
bob
along
the
street
and
gayly
danced
the
schoolmaster
the
people
looked
out
of
their
windows
and
laughed
and
the
poor
schoolmaster
begged
bob
to
leave
off
playing
no
no
answered
bob
i
saw
you
make
poor
little
ralph
ruddy
dance
with
pain
it
is
your
turn
just
then
the
squire
s
butler
came
down
the
street
of
course
he
was
much
puzzled
to
see
the
schoolmaster
dancing
to
the
sound
of
a
boy
s
whistle
but
he
was
presently
more
surprised
to
find
himself
doing
the
very
same
thing
he
tried
with
all
his
might
to
retain
his
stately
gait
but
it
was
all
of
no
use
his
legs
flew
up
in
spite
of
himself
and
away
he
went
behind
the
schoolmaster
following
bob
all
through
the
village
the
best
sight
was
still
to
come
for
the
tyrannical
farmer
thornycroft
was
just
then
walking
home
from
market
in
a
great
heat
with
a
big
sample
of
corn
in
each
of
his
and
turning
suddenly
round
a
corner
went
right
into
the
middle
of
the
strange
procession
and
caught
the
infection
in
a
moment
up
flew
his
great
fat
legs
and
away
he
went
pitching
and
tossing
and
jumping
and
twirling
and
jigging
up
and
down
like
an
elephant
in
a
fit
how
the
people
laughed
to
be
sure
standing
in
their
doorways
and
viewing
this
odd
trio
it
was
good
for
them
that
they
did
not
come
too
near
or
they
would
have
been
seized
with
the
fit
as
well
the
schoolmaster
was
nearly
fainting
the
butler
was
in
despair
and
the
perspiration
poured
down
the
farmer
s
face
but
that
mattered
not
to
bob
he
had
promised
himself
to
take
them
for
a
dance
all
round
the
village
and
he
did
it
and
at
length
when
he
had
completed
the
tour
he
stopped
for
just
one
minute
and
asked
the
schoolmaster
whether
he
would
beg
ralph
ruddy
s
pardon
and
the
schoolmaster
said
he
would
if
only
bob
would
leave
off
playing
then
he
asked
the
farmer
if
he
would
take
his
father
back
and
pay
him
his
wages
and
the
farmer
said
he
would
and
finally
he
asked
the
butler
if
he
would
give
up
the
spoon
that
he
had
stolen
and
confess
to
the
squire
that
bob
s
mother
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
but
the
butler
said
oh
no
indeed
illustration
away
went
the
schoolmaster
s
legs
cutting
such
capers
as
the
world
never
looked
upon
before
so
bob
began
to
play
again
and
they
all
began
to
dance
again
till
at
last
the
schoolmaster
and
the
farmer
both
punched
the
butler
until
he
promised
and
then
bob
left
off
playing
the
three
poor
men
went
home
in
a
terrible
plight
and
the
schoolmaster
begged
little
ralph
s
pardon
and
the
butler
cleared
the
stain
from
bob
s
mother
s
character
and
bob
s
father
went
back
to
work
and
farmer
thornycroft
soon
afterwards
took
bob
on
too
and
he
made
the
best
that
ever
lived
the
story
lady
rested
a
minute
while
the
story
people
were
laughing
and
talking
about
what
they
had
heard
as
she
began
again
there
was
instant
silence
the
next
story
she
said
is
that
of
a
brave
girl
who
lived
in
the
xxviii
ann
catches
a
thief
as
a
rule
the
office
in
which
ann
carstairs
was
employed
did
not
close
until
six
o
clock
but
at
on
the
december
afternoon
of
this
story
ann
found
herself
alone
at
four
the
heads
of
the
firm
left
for
the
day
and
the
billing
clerk
and
the
stenographer
taking
advantage
of
the
absence
of
authority
helped
themselves
to
an
extra
half
hour
we
have
a
little
shopping
to
do
the
billing
clerk
explained
as
they
passed
ann
s
desk
before
they
reached
the
stair
door
the
inside
salesman
closed
his
desk
with
a
snap
and
seized
his
hat
and
coat
wait
a
minute
girls
he
called
i
ll
take
you
down
to
broadway
in
my
as
he
followed
them
he
said
to
ann
good
night
miss
carstairs
don
t
stay
late
a
few
minutes
after
they
had
gone
bradford
the
bookkeeper
closed
the
safe
and
twirled
the
nickel
knob
gayly
i
m
off
too
he
announced
i
m
going
to
leave
the
vault
for
you
to
close
miss
he
shrugged
himself
into
his
overcoat
and
departed
stiffly
he
had
worked
hard
over
his
books
that
afternoon
and
his
legs
and
arms
were
aching
in
unison
with
his
head
he
came
back
for
a
moment
to
turn
off
some
of
the
big
lights
no
use
wasting
electricity
he
explained
no
one
will
be
in
this
evening
and
a
little
girl
like
you
can
t
use
all
this
a
minute
later
ann
heard
the
street
door
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
close
with
a
bang
and
she
was
left
all
alone
in
the
big
office
she
was
not
sorry
to
be
alone
the
day
had
been
hard
and
her
nerves
had
been
near
the
breaking
point
all
the
afternoon
the
switchboard
was
ann
s
special
charge
but
she
also
took
care
of
the
odds
and
ends
of
copy
work
and
dictation
for
her
busy
associates
odds
and
ends
have
a
curious
way
of
accumulating
and
ann
seldom
had
a
spare
moment
i
m
just
dead
tired
she
declared
aloud
raising
her
arms
above
her
head
in
a
vain
effort
to
relieve
their
ache
i
m
always
snowed
under
with
work
yet
no
one
seems
to
think
i
have
anything
to
do
it
s
just
miss
carstairs
will
you
copy
that
for
me
i
ll
give
you
a
letter
now
miss
carstairs
and
you
can
run
it
off
in
your
spare
spare
time
did
any
one
ever
see
me
with
a
moment
to
spare
they
don
t
think
i
amount
to
a
row
of
pins
anyway
i
d
just
like
to
show
them
i
d
like
to
let
ross
see
that
i
do
amount
to
ross
was
the
senior
partner
of
the
big
manufacturing
plant
and
ann
admired
him
immensely
he
was
so
calm
so
quiet
and
yet
so
forceful
a
splendid
business
man
but
one
whose
family
s
wants
and
wishes
were
cared
for
before
all
else
ann
knew
he
must
be
an
ideal
father
for
he
possessed
all
the
qualities
that
ann
s
own
father
had
lacked
carstairs
had
been
far
from
an
ideal
parent
and
had
ended
his
selfish
careless
life
just
as
ann
was
preparing
to
enter
college
ann
and
her
mother
had
bravely
gathered
together
what
money
remained
and
ann
started
off
to
a
business
school
instead
for
three
months
she
worked
feverishly
night
and
day
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
when
their
finances
were
in
a
precarious
condition
she
left
the
school
to
enter
the
manufacturing
firm
of
ross
and
hayward
she
had
been
there
for
nearly
two
years
now
years
of
worry
and
careful
planning
to
make
the
slender
salary
cover
growing
needs
we
have
almost
proved
that
the
necessities
of
life
are
unnecessary
so
nearly
have
we
come
to
getting
along
on
next
to
nothing
she
had
laughingly
told
her
mother
only
the
evening
before
but
though
she
joked
about
it
the
situation
was
becoming
serious
and
ann
had
reached
the
place
where
she
felt
that
she
must
steel
herself
to
the
point
of
asking
for
more
wages
do
people
always
have
to
ask
for
an
increase
she
wondered
everybody
here
treats
me
as
if
i
were
a
child
except
when
it
comes
to
giving
me
work
that
s
a
different
ann
did
not
as
a
rule
complain
about
the
amount
of
work
she
had
to
do
instead
she
was
rather
proud
of
being
able
to
accomplish
so
much
in
a
single
day
however
she
was
tired
and
all
out
of
sorts
she
felt
too
that
her
looks
were
all
against
her
curly
hair
and
freckles
added
to
a
diminutive
figure
gave
her
a
decidedly
childlike
appearance
i
wish
she
declared
to
herself
i
wish
i
were
tall
and
had
straight
hair
and
wrinkles
around
my
mouth
what
chance
has
anyone
to
advance
when
she
is
short
and
freckled
i
just
must
make
them
sit
up
and
take
notice
she
glanced
around
her
with
a
proprietary
look
as
she
spoke
her
desk
and
switchboard
were
in
the
outer
office
near
the
head
of
the
short
flight
of
stairs
leading
from
the
street
door
and
commanded
a
view
of
the
entrance
door
and
the
stairway
leading
to
the
upper
floors
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
room
was
the
entrance
to
the
stock
room
and
beside
it
the
great
iron
door
leading
to
the
vault
where
the
business
records
were
kept
in
the
dark
corner
by
the
vault
door
stood
two
tall
piles
of
sales
books
since
the
bookkeeper
had
turned
off
the
extra
lights
the
big
office
was
lighted
only
by
the
globe
above
ann
s
head
the
heavy
presses
and
machinery
in
the
factory
running
at
full
speed
shook
the
building
and
their
roar
and
clatter
sounded
unusually
loud
now
that
the
office
was
quiet
the
switchboard
was
never
very
busy
after
five
and
ann
leaned
back
in
her
chair
and
closed
her
eyes
for
a
moment
she
opened
them
almost
immediately
with
a
start
suddenly
aware
of
another
presence
in
the
big
office
the
new
janitor
a
scraggly
feather
duster
in
his
hand
stood
by
her
desk
did
you
want
something
ann
asked
sharply
she
did
not
approve
of
the
new
janitor
his
hair
was
too
long
and
shaggy
his
chin
too
stubbly
and
his
bushy
eyebrows
shaded
eyelids
that
drooped
his
appearance
was
in
accord
with
his
shiftless
way
of
dusting
and
sweeping
ann
thought
with
disfavor
her
voice
was
decidedly
sharp
as
she
asked
again
did
you
want
something
i
wanted
to
see
the
cashier
the
man
answered
his
drooping
eyelids
gave
a
peculiar
leering
expression
to
his
face
that
filled
ann
with
repulsion
then
she
braced
herself
no
matter
how
afraid
she
was
he
must
not
know
it
he
has
gone
for
the
day
come
back
in
the
morning
she
said
turning
to
her
typewriter
to
cut
the
conversation
short
the
man
hesitated
for
a
moment
but
her
preoccupied
air
chilled
him
and
ann
soon
heard
him
walk
away
at
that
moment
a
tall
young
woman
came
hurrying
down
the
stairs
from
the
upper
floor
i
declare
she
cried
looking
about
the
darkened
office
everybody
has
gone
home
and
bradford
has
locked
the
safe
now
will
you
tell
me
miss
carstairs
what
i
am
going
to
do
with
all
this
money
she
waved
a
green
cardboard
box
in
the
air
as
she
spoke
her
voice
rising
higher
and
higher
in
her
agitation
i
have
collected
eight
hundred
dollars
on
those
liberty
bond
payments
and
here
bradford
has
locked
the
safe
and
gone
home
i
m
going
to
the
country
and
i
can
t
take
all
this
money
with
sh
miss
benson
ann
warned
glancing
quickly
at
the
swing
door
that
had
not
yet
ceased
swaying
after
the
departing
janitor
don
t
tell
any
one
can
t
you
put
it
in
the
vault
bradford
left
it
for
me
to
lock
but
miss
benson
objected
something
may
happen
to
it
and
i
am
responsible
i
can
t
take
it
with
me
though
i
ll
have
to
put
it
in
there
i
see
miss
carstairs
she
called
a
moment
later
from
the
depths
of
the
vault
i
m
putting
it
beside
the
stamp
with
miss
benson
s
departure
the
big
office
suddenly
seemed
doubly
large
and
dim
and
empty
ann
shivered
slightly
appalled
by
the
fact
that
she
was
alone
with
eight
hundred
dollars
in
cash
in
the
open
vault
the
factory
machinery
made
such
a
din
that
none
of
the
employees
could
hear
if
she
called
for
help
what
would
she
do
if
the
janitor
had
overheard
miss
benson
and
should
make
up
his
mind
to
steal
the
money
she
glanced
sharply
at
the
swinging
door
it
was
quiet
now
she
reassured
herself
i
m
as
nervous
as
miss
benson
i
ll
just
shut
that
vault
now
though
and
have
it
over
with
it
is
almost
six
o
clock
at
that
moment
a
call
came
in
on
the
telephone
the
strident
whir
startling
the
girl
with
its
suddenness
ross
and
hayward
she
answered
mechanically
into
the
receiver
miss
carstairs
it
was
ross
speaking
i
left
a
couple
of
liberty
bonds
in
my
desk
please
tell
bradford
to
put
them
into
the
mr
bradford
has
gone
for
the
day
ross
she
answered
but
he
has
left
the
vault
for
me
to
close
i
ll
put
them
all
right
put
them
in
the
stamp
box
i
guess
they
ll
be
all
right
there
good
night
ann
pulled
out
the
plug
and
rose
from
her
desk
her
shoes
made
no
noise
as
she
crossed
the
room
she
found
the
bonds
face
down
on
ross
s
desk
and
as
she
picked
them
up
she
could
not
fail
to
notice
the
denominations
she
stared
at
them
two
thousand
dollars
she
whispered
awestruck
if
only
they
were
mine
as
she
started
to
place
them
in
the
stamp
box
its
shabbiness
caught
her
eye
she
hesitated
then
laid
the
bonds
down
i
ll
get
a
new
box
for
the
stamps
she
decided
snapping
off
the
light
as
she
left
the
vault
ann
knew
just
where
to
find
the
particular
box
that
she
wanted
and
did
not
stop
to
turn
on
the
light
as
she
entered
the
stockroom
she
was
in
the
act
of
reaching
up
for
the
box
when
the
door
stealthily
opened
she
shrank
back
against
the
shelves
as
the
new
janitor
came
in
he
stopped
for
a
moment
and
glanced
around
then
a
minute
later
ann
heard
the
snap
of
the
electric
button
as
the
light
in
the
vault
was
turned
on
she
gasped
in
dismay
the
bonds
and
the
liberty
loan
money
were
all
there
in
plain
sight
for
a
brief
moment
the
girl
was
paralyzed
with
fright
the
janitor
was
after
the
money
she
rushed
forward
as
she
paused
by
the
open
doorway
of
the
vault
she
had
a
momentary
glimpse
of
the
janitor
with
the
green
box
in
one
hand
and
heard
the
familiar
crackly
paper
of
the
bonds
as
he
hurriedly
thrust
them
into
his
pocket
in
a
panic
she
caught
the
huge
iron
door
and
slammed
it
shut
hurriedly
throwing
the
big
bolt
in
place
i
ve
got
him
she
gasped
exultantly
but
the
words
had
not
left
her
lips
before
she
was
knocked
from
her
feet
by
a
sudden
blow
on
her
shoulder
as
she
fell
another
stunning
blow
came
upon
her
head
a
minute
later
so
it
seemed
to
the
girl
she
opened
her
eyes
to
find
ross
and
his
daughter
margaret
bending
over
her
she
s
coming
to
now
she
could
faintly
hear
ross
say
bathe
her
head
some
then
he
added
jokingly
well
now
miss
ann
you
certainly
gave
us
a
start
what
were
you
trying
to
do
ann
s
head
ached
agonizingly
she
lifted
her
hand
to
her
forehead
and
felt
it
gingerly
a
lump
as
large
as
a
walnut
was
there
just
above
the
temple
she
became
aware
now
that
the
mist
was
fading
from
her
eyes
and
the
ringing
from
her
ears
that
the
factory
was
quiet
all
the
noise
of
machinery
had
ceased
what
time
is
it
she
asked
and
then
without
waiting
for
an
answer
where
did
you
come
from
it
is
after
eight
we
were
driving
by
on
our
way
to
see
a
friend
on
the
east
side
and
i
thought
i
would
drop
in
and
see
if
you
had
remembered
to
lock
the
ross
laughed
fortunate
for
you
that
i
doubted
your
ann
raised
her
head
and
looked
about
her
then
she
dropped
it
heavily
back
on
the
improvised
pillow
miss
ross
had
tucked
under
her
head
it
was
that
old
sales
book
that
knocked
me
down
it
must
have
been
on
the
edge
of
the
pile
and
tipped
over
when
i
slammed
the
she
felt
the
bump
on
her
head
again
i
suppose
i
hit
the
wrapping
desk
when
i
it
wouldn
t
take
much
to
knock
out
a
little
thing
like
you
ross
laughed
ann
opened
her
eyes
again
a
thought
flashed
through
her
mind
and
she
sat
bolt
upright
on
the
floor
mr
ross
she
said
if
i
can
prove
to
you
that
i
was
big
enough
to
save
you
two
thousand
dollars
would
you
think
me
big
enough
to
be
given
an
increase
in
salary
i
surely
would
miss
carstairs
ross
answered
becoming
suddenly
grave
ann
s
voice
shook
with
excitement
your
bonds
are
safe
in
the
vault
ross
together
with
eight
hundred
dollars
that
miss
benson
collected
on
liberty
loan
payments
and
the
new
janitor
you
re
a
brave
girl
said
ross
helping
her
to
her
feet
the
increase
is
yours
you
have
certainly
earned
she
was
indeed
a
brave
girl
said
the
story
king
as
the
story
lady
paused
and
deserved
all
her
good
the
next
went
on
the
story
lady
smiling
is
the
story
of
a
young
man
and
a
young
woman
whose
only
ambition
in
life
was
to
help
xxix
john
and
margaret
paton
among
savages
the
tropical
island
of
aniwa
drowsed
in
the
afternoon
sunshine
long
lazy
swells
rolling
in
from
the
pacific
broke
on
the
outlying
reefs
overflowed
into
the
turquoise
bay
and
gently
lapped
the
stretch
of
sandy
beach
the
softest
of
breezes
stirred
the
palm
trees
and
rustled
the
banana
thickets
before
the
door
of
a
low
thatched
hut
nestling
under
a
clump
of
stood
a
young
woman
anxiously
watching
a
canoe
which
was
making
a
perilous
passage
through
the
surf
to
the
shelter
of
the
bay
when
at
last
it
slid
into
smooth
water
she
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
and
went
slowly
down
the
hill
toward
the
shore
the
craft
nosed
stealthily
up
to
the
beach
where
a
stalwart
white
man
sprang
out
then
the
boat
propelled
by
the
muscular
arms
of
two
blacks
slipped
away
and
vanished
around
a
little
promontory
i
m
glad
you
re
safe
home
john
the
young
woman
cried
as
the
big
man
came
swiftly
toward
her
is
all
well
very
far
from
that
margaret
the
newcomer
answered
as
he
reached
her
side
i
ve
found
a
great
deal
of
unrest
throughout
the
because
of
the
drought
yes
he
replied
and
stood
looking
down
upon
her
thoughtfully
she
came
nearer
and
slipped
her
arm
through
his
i
can
see
that
you
are
anxious
john
she
said
softly
do
you
fear
an
uprising
illustration
before
the
door
of
a
low
thatched
hut
stood
a
young
woman
margaret
he
exclaimed
as
they
turned
and
began
to
climb
the
hill
to
the
hut
i
should
not
have
brought
you
here
oh
she
cried
more
than
anything
else
i
desired
the
privilege
of
helping
you
in
your
work
do
you
mean
that
i
have
failed
that
i
have
proved
a
burden
rather
than
a
help
you
know
it
is
not
that
he
replied
quickly
you
have
been
wonderful
dear
but
i
should
not
have
allowed
you
to
leave
old
scotland
for
the
hardships
and
perils
of
these
heathen
it
has
not
been
easy
she
acknowledged
but
i
have
never
once
regretted
i
thought
i
was
doing
right
to
bring
you
he
went
on
but
now
now
you
feel
she
interposed
that
we
are
in
real
danger
we
shall
be
if
the
natives
rise
he
replied
i
think
you
should
know
the
truth
her
blue
eyes
darkened
but
there
was
no
fear
in
them
but
the
people
have
come
to
feel
we
are
their
friends
she
protested
some
of
them
love
us
surely
they
will
not
harm
by
this
time
they
had
reached
the
hut
he
put
her
gently
into
a
before
the
door
and
flung
himself
upon
the
white
sand
at
her
feet
a
touched
on
the
other
side
of
the
island
yesterday
he
told
her
and
paid
for
five
hundred
pounds
worth
of
sandalwood
with
a
barrel
of
rum
i
suppose
she
commented
they
were
a
little
more
generous
this
time
he
replied
grimly
they
left
several
no
wonder
then
she
said
that
the
people
are
mad
they
also
left
he
continued
in
the
mind
of
the
old
chief
the
impression
that
we
missionaries
are
responsible
for
the
oh
too
bad
she
exclaimed
softly
yes
he
agreed
old
namakei
informed
me
just
now
that
if
another
moon
passes
without
rain
the
island
will
have
no
more
of
our
god
or
of
what
did
you
answer
she
asked
i
told
him
and
he
smiled
that
i
would
dig
in
the
earth
and
reveal
a
place
where
god
s
rain
is
buried
he
scoffed
at
first
but
finally
agreed
to
come
with
his
warriors
and
help
with
the
but
john
she
queried
will
you
really
be
able
to
dig
a
well
on
this
island
of
course
i
can
t
be
certain
he
answered
but
i
ve
been
studying
the
soil
and
it
seems
probable
anyway
it
s
our
one
chance
to
appease
the
old
chief
s
ire
and
continue
our
john
gibson
paton
had
come
out
to
the
new
hebrides
some
years
before
and
settled
on
the
cannibal
island
of
tanna
he
had
begun
at
once
to
teach
the
people
and
had
succeeded
in
greatly
improving
their
condition
when
a
trading
vessel
had
brought
measles
to
the
island
an
epidemic
followed
and
the
natives
died
like
flies
they
were
so
bitterly
angry
against
those
who
had
brought
the
plague
that
they
became
suspicious
of
all
white
men
even
the
missionary
who
had
always
helped
them
and
he
was
finally
obliged
to
flee
for
his
life
with
great
difficulty
he
escaped
to
a
passing
ship
bound
for
australia
from
australia
he
went
to
his
homeland
scotland
he
had
a
wonderfully
happy
time
on
this
visit
among
his
friends
and
relatives
for
he
was
married
to
the
pretty
scotch
lassie
whom
he
had
learned
to
love
he
felt
that
life
would
be
very
hard
for
her
on
the
island
of
tanna
and
he
decided
to
go
instead
to
aniwa
where
the
natives
were
less
fierce
and
more
intelligent
besides
they
had
asked
that
a
missionary
be
sent
to
them
they
were
very
glad
when
he
came
bringing
his
pretty
wife
and
they
tried
to
learn
all
he
told
them
all
went
well
until
the
traders
who
came
to
the
south
seas
for
sandalwood
and
cocoanuts
and
the
rich
tropical
fruits
discovered
that
the
natives
were
becoming
more
intelligent
and
could
not
be
cheated
or
swindled
so
easily
since
the
missionaries
were
teaching
them
so
the
traders
made
up
their
minds
to
try
to
turn
the
blacks
against
doctor
paton
and
his
wife
and
his
native
helpers
they
had
not
been
able
to
do
much
until
the
time
of
the
long
drought
told
about
at
the
beginning
of
this
story
you
see
they
depended
almost
entirely
upon
rain
for
fresh
water
to
drink
never
before
in
the
memory
of
living
men
had
the
islands
been
so
long
without
rain
the
people
were
terrified
and
ready
for
any
outbreak
but
the
young
missionaries
sitting
silently
under
the
palms
realized
that
the
traders
might
so
excite
the
natives
with
their
talk
and
with
the
rum
that
they
might
become
murderers
and
revert
to
cannibalism
where
will
you
dig
the
well
john
margaret
asked
at
length
on
the
slope
over
he
nodded
toward
the
opposite
hill
i
shall
begin
work
chief
namakei
comes
an
hour
after
if
you
succeed
in
reaching
fresh
water
shall
we
be
safe
yes
and
if
not
i
hate
to
think
of
what
may
but
anyway
she
declared
i
m
sure
you
will
find
god
s
rain
weary
days
and
nights
followed
days
when
the
doctor
and
his
band
of
native
helpers
dug
from
dawn
to
dark
in
the
sandy
soil
nights
when
the
young
white
people
too
anxious
to
sleep
sat
under
their
palm
trees
and
watched
while
the
moon
sank
into
the
sea
and
the
volcano
of
tann
the
lighthouse
of
the
pacific
flung
its
blazing
banners
high
against
the
heavens
two
weeks
passed
and
the
diggers
found
no
water
then
one
day
the
continued
drought
left
the
old
chief
s
favorite
quite
dry
on
the
same
day
the
side
of
the
new
well
caved
in
the
two
troubles
coming
together
turned
the
interest
of
namakei
to
suspicion
when
the
digging
began
again
he
forbade
his
men
to
take
part
in
the
work
and
though
he
still
watched
the
other
toilers
his
beady
eyes
had
the
look
of
a
hawk
s
just
ready
to
pounce
upon
its
prey
the
moon
was
full
before
the
was
repaired
the
next
morning
the
two
remaining
helpers
did
not
report
for
duty
and
old
namakei
told
the
doctor
that
they
would
not
come
back
they
are
my
prisoners
he
laughed
if
missi
paton
wish
help
in
finding
the
buried
rain
let
his
god
give
his
god
will
give
it
the
missionary
replied
calmly
and
alone
doctor
paton
went
on
with
his
undertaking
two
days
three
days
passed
and
still
no
water
namakei
assumed
a
more
threatening
attitude
the
moon
wanes
he
warned
the
missionary
and
then
one
morning
when
the
doctor
went
down
into
the
well
he
saw
something
gleaming
at
his
feet
he
bent
down
gazing
with
eager
eyes
it
was
water
but
will
it
be
fresh
he
asked
himself
with
heart
on
so
tiny
an
island
the
sea
water
might
easily
penetrate
the
soil
very
slowly
he
dipped
his
finger
into
the
now
water
and
lifted
it
to
his
lips
and
then
suddenly
he
sank
down
in
the
dampness
and
wept
like
a
child
the
water
was
fresh
and
pure
and
sweet
god
s
rain
indeed
by
noonday
the
well
was
filled
with
the
water
and
from
every
part
of
the
island
the
natives
gathered
to
behold
the
miracle
of
the
rain
which
had
come
up
from
the
earth
instead
of
down
from
the
sky
and
to
do
honor
to
missi
paton
who
had
given
it
to
them
and
when
he
assured
them
that
it
would
always
be
there
so
long
as
the
island
remained
in
the
sea
and
that
drought
would
nevermore
bring
suffering
and
distress
among
them
they
kissed
his
hands
in
gratitude
never
again
did
the
evil
words
of
the
traders
against
their
beloved
missi
have
any
weight
with
the
natives
of
aniwa
and
never
again
did
they
turn
away
from
the
christian
religion
and
the
christian
god
and
if
you
should
visit
the
island
you
would
be
shown
by
the
proud
people
the
well
where
john
gibson
paton
found
by
faith
and
prayer
and
labor
the
buried
blessing
so
many
years
ago
again
the
story
people
clapped
their
hands
as
the
story
ended
for
they
love
to
hear
of
nothing
better
than
a
brave
and
an
unselfish
deed
that
is
a
good
story
said
mary
frances
yes
said
the
story
king
the
stories
of
those
who
risk
their
lives
for
others
are
the
best
of
all
our
yes
agreed
the
story
queen
they
are
the
best
of
now
said
the
story
lady
we
come
to
our
fourth
xxx
the
strange
guest
on
the
summit
of
one
of
the
heights
of
a
wild
country
district
along
the
rhine
there
stood
many
years
ago
an
old
castle
in
this
castle
lived
a
beautiful
maiden
with
her
father
and
two
elderly
aunts
her
father
was
a
jolly
old
nobleman
very
fond
of
his
beer
and
very
fond
of
hearing
himself
talk
too
he
enjoyed
his
own
jokes
better
than
anyone
else
perhaps
even
so
his
dearest
possession
was
his
beautiful
daughter
his
only
child
he
loved
her
as
the
apple
of
his
eye
and
wished
to
give
her
all
happiness
she
had
little
chance
of
being
lonely
for
there
were
always
a
large
number
of
poor
relatives
visiting
the
nobleman
and
indeed
they
made
these
visits
so
long
that
they
sometimes
stayed
for
years
she
often
wondered
however
who
might
be
living
in
the
castle
on
the
heights
across
the
valley
she
could
just
see
the
outlines
of
the
walls
and
towers
on
clear
days
from
the
balcony
outside
her
bedroom
window
father
she
said
one
day
could
we
not
ride
over
to
that
castle
some
time
i
m
forever
dreaming
stories
about
those
who
live
within
a
heavy
cloud
settled
over
her
father
s
countenance
never
let
me
hear
you
make
mention
of
it
again
my
daughter
he
thundered
and
of
course
she
said
no
more
but
she
spoke
about
it
to
one
of
her
aunts
that
evening
dear
aunt
why
was
my
father
vexed
when
i
mentioned
that
castle
this
morning
she
asked
pointing
out
of
her
window
hush
my
child
replied
her
aunt
there
is
a
feud
between
the
two
a
feud
questioned
the
maiden
a
feud
why
we
do
not
even
know
them
how
can
there
be
a
feud
it
dates
back
to
the
time
of
our
her
aunt
told
her
and
no
loyal
member
of
this
family
would
ever
have
anything
to
do
with
a
member
of
that
family
never
mention
the
matter
again
then
suddenly
changing
the
subject
did
you
finish
your
embroidery
stint
for
how
far
have
you
worked
let
me
the
maiden
blushed
arose
and
brought
a
large
sheet
of
unfinished
tapestry
to
her
aunt
which
she
unfolded
before
her
her
aunt
put
on
her
spectacles
to
examine
the
work
wait
she
exclaimed
i
ll
call
my
the
other
aunt
was
in
the
doorway
however
and
joined
her
in
examining
the
work
i
see
a
missed
stitch
here
she
commented
ah
yes
and
a
loose
end
there
added
the
other
it
is
growing
dark
no
knowing
how
many
flaws
we
would
find
by
daylight
you
will
do
better
i
i
will
try
promised
the
niece
and
so
the
maiden
grew
by
the
time
she
was
eighteen
she
could
not
only
embroider
tapestries
and
play
a
dozen
airs
on
her
guitar
and
harp
but
could
write
a
short
note
with
not
more
than
ten
misspelled
words
and
could
sign
her
own
full
name
without
missing
a
letter
these
accomplishments
in
that
day
were
considered
quite
a
finished
education
for
a
young
lady
on
her
eighteenth
birthday
the
castle
was
in
bustling
excitement
because
there
was
to
be
an
affair
of
utmost
importance
and
this
affair
was
none
other
than
a
great
family
gathering
to
receive
the
intended
bridegroom
of
the
maiden
her
father
had
promised
her
in
marriage
to
the
son
of
an
old
nobleman
a
friend
of
his
who
lived
in
a
distant
province
the
parents
had
arranged
all
the
details
and
the
young
people
were
engaged
to
be
married
without
even
seeing
each
other
the
time
was
appointed
for
the
wedding
which
was
to
take
place
at
the
home
of
the
maiden
on
her
eighteenth
birthday
the
bridegroom
had
already
set
out
on
his
journey
and
was
expected
to
arrive
at
any
moment
the
castle
was
in
a
tumult
the
fair
bride
had
been
decked
out
with
uncommon
care
her
aunts
had
quarreled
about
every
article
of
her
dress
and
while
they
were
quarreling
she
had
made
up
her
own
mind
about
each
article
she
would
wear
the
result
was
that
she
looked
as
lovely
as
a
dream
the
soft
lustre
of
her
eyes
the
hue
of
her
cheeks
the
quick
rise
and
fall
of
her
bosom
showed
the
excitement
in
her
heart
meanwhile
her
aunts
gave
her
all
kinds
of
directions
as
to
her
behavior
when
you
first
see
him
my
dear
niece
advised
one
aunt
lower
your
eyes
as
becomes
a
modest
young
yes
added
the
other
aunt
and
when
you
courtesy
catch
your
skirts
so
and
she
made
a
deep
bow
the
old
baron
was
no
less
busy
with
preparations
than
the
others
having
in
fact
nothing
to
do
but
wait
he
worried
everybody
else
about
every
detail
he
wandered
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
of
the
castle
begging
everybody
to
be
diligent
and
filling
everybody
with
anxiety
he
was
naturally
a
bustling
little
man
and
he
buzzed
about
in
every
hall
and
chamber
like
a
fly
on
a
warm
summer
s
day
in
the
meantime
things
had
been
gathered
together
for
the
making
of
a
great
feast
the
forests
had
rung
with
the
sound
of
the
huntsman
s
horn
the
kitchen
was
crowded
with
good
cheer
and
the
castle
was
a
model
of
ancient
hospitality
the
long
tables
had
been
spread
with
the
handsomest
trenchers
and
dishes
within
the
castle
the
last
finishing
touches
had
been
added
to
the
wedding
gown
the
bride
waited
trembling
with
anxious
expectation
everything
was
ready
to
receive
the
distinguished
guest
but
the
guest
did
not
come
hour
after
hour
rolled
by
the
sun
began
to
set
and
the
baron
mounted
for
the
eleventh
time
to
the
high
tower
and
strained
his
eyes
in
hope
of
catching
sight
of
the
count
and
his
attendants
once
he
thought
he
saw
them
for
there
were
a
number
of
men
seen
advancing
slowly
on
horseback
but
when
they
had
nearly
reached
the
foot
of
the
mountain
they
suddenly
struck
off
in
a
different
direction
the
last
rays
of
the
sun
departed
the
bats
began
to
flit
by
in
the
twilight
the
road
grew
dimmer
and
dimmer
to
sight
and
nothing
seemed
to
be
stirring
in
it
except
now
and
then
a
peasant
lagging
homeward
from
his
day
s
labor
while
the
old
castle
was
in
this
nervous
state
very
different
things
were
happening
to
the
bridegroom
the
young
count
was
riding
along
on
horseback
in
a
fashion
toward
the
bride
he
had
never
seen
there
is
no
haste
necessary
he
said
to
his
attendants
we
will
be
there
all
in
good
time
let
us
enjoy
the
at
the
inn
where
he
stopped
for
refreshment
he
met
another
young
nobleman
with
whom
he
had
been
good
friends
several
years
before
while
both
were
in
the
army
and
which
way
do
you
travel
asked
the
count
s
friend
we
go
through
the
east
pass
and
upward
through
the
mountain
road
he
replied
how
fortunate
exclaimed
his
friend
i
am
going
in
the
same
so
they
agreed
to
travel
together
and
soon
set
off
the
count
leaving
word
for
his
servants
to
follow
and
overtake
him
later
now
tell
what
has
happened
in
your
life
since
we
last
met
said
the
count
s
friend
as
their
horses
stepped
out
abreast
has
your
heart
been
touched
by
the
beauty
of
any
maiden
illustration
once
he
thought
he
saw
them
then
the
count
told
him
about
his
coming
wedding
with
a
young
lady
he
had
never
seen
but
who
was
said
to
be
very
lovely
in
this
way
they
entered
one
of
the
loneliest
and
most
thickly
wooded
passes
in
the
mountains
all
this
happened
in
the
days
when
bands
of
robbers
lived
in
woods
and
when
ghosts
were
said
to
haunt
old
castles
as
the
count
turned
to
speak
to
his
companion
suddenly
from
out
the
woods
there
sprang
a
small
band
of
robbers
who
immediately
attacked
them
they
made
a
brave
fight
but
were
nearly
overcome
by
numbers
when
the
count
s
retinue
of
servants
came
riding
up
the
robbers
fled
at
sight
of
them
but
not
until
they
had
given
the
count
a
dreadful
wound
he
was
carried
back
to
the
nearest
town
through
which
he
had
so
joyfully
ridden
such
a
short
while
before
a
priest
who
was
also
quite
a
doctor
was
brought
to
his
bedside
but
everyone
knew
that
the
poor
young
count
s
moments
were
few
to
live
in
this
world
he
motioned
his
friend
near
and
whispered
between
gasping
breaths
i
beg
you
to
go
to
the
castle
of
my
betrothed
and
tell
why
i
did
not
keep
my
then
gathering
strength
he
added
in
a
stronger
voice
unless
this
is
done
i
shall
not
sleep
quietly
in
my
grave
he
spoke
so
solemnly
that
his
friend
gave
his
promise
without
hesitating
this
seemed
to
soothe
him
and
he
closed
his
eyes
as
if
in
sleep
but
he
soon
began
to
talk
wildly
and
call
for
his
horse
saying
he
must
hasten
to
the
home
of
his
bride
and
thinking
he
was
leaping
into
the
saddle
he
suddenly
drew
his
last
breath
his
friend
was
deeply
grieved
his
heart
was
heavy
within
him
he
scarcely
knew
how
to
keep
his
promise
for
he
was
the
son
of
the
nobleman
whose
castle
the
maiden
had
been
forbidden
to
mention
and
because
of
the
feud
between
the
two
families
he
hated
all
the
more
to
be
the
bearer
of
such
bad
news
still
he
thought
that
he
would
like
to
see
the
lovely
girl
and
he
felt
that
he
must
try
to
carry
out
the
promise
he
had
made
to
his
dying
friend
so
he
made
arrangements
for
the
poor
count
s
burial
in
the
cathedral
near
the
graves
of
his
noble
ancestors
and
set
out
on
his
journey
it
is
now
high
time
that
we
should
return
to
the
castle
where
everybody
was
hungrily
awaiting
the
guest
night
closed
in
but
still
no
guest
arrived
the
baron
descended
from
the
high
tower
in
despair
it
is
so
dark
that
i
can
see
nothing
now
he
said
there
is
no
use
in
watching
the
banquet
had
been
postponed
from
hour
to
hour
the
cooks
in
the
kitchen
were
desperate
the
meats
were
already
overdone
and
every
one
was
beginning
to
look
as
though
it
were
a
time
of
famine
we
can
not
delay
longer
the
baron
finally
said
i
fear
we
must
proceed
with
the
feast
without
our
all
were
seated
at
the
table
and
on
the
point
of
commencing
when
the
sound
of
a
horn
from
outside
the
gate
gave
notice
that
a
stranger
was
approaching
another
long
blast
filled
the
old
courts
of
the
castle
with
its
echoes
and
was
answered
by
the
warden
from
the
walls
the
baron
hastened
to
receive
his
future
the
drawbridge
had
been
let
down
and
the
stranger
was
before
the
gate
he
was
a
tall
gallant
cavalier
mounted
on
a
beautiful
black
steed
his
face
was
pale
he
had
a
gleaming
eye
and
yet
wore
an
air
of
sadness
the
baron
was
a
little
embarrassed
to
think
that
he
should
come
in
so
simple
a
way
without
a
retinue
of
friends
and
servants
he
thought
that
the
young
count
did
not
show
proper
appreciation
of
the
honor
of
marrying
his
daughter
but
he
comforted
himself
by
thinking
he
has
been
so
anxious
to
see
his
bride
that
he
has
hurried
off
without
waiting
for
i
am
sorry
began
the
stranger
to
break
in
upon
you
at
such
an
hour
oh
pray
do
not
worry
interrupted
the
baron
it
is
as
nothing
and
he
continued
with
a
world
of
compliment
and
greeting
for
to
tell
the
truth
the
baron
was
very
proud
of
his
ability
to
make
pretty
speeches
he
kept
on
talking
so
fast
that
the
stranger
was
unable
to
put
a
word
in
edgewise
and
by
the
time
he
paused
they
had
reached
the
inner
court
of
the
castle
the
stranger
was
again
about
to
speak
when
he
was
once
more
interrupted
by
a
group
of
the
baron
s
relatives
leading
forth
the
blushing
bride
wedding
the
stranger
gazed
on
her
for
a
moment
as
one
entranced
it
seemed
as
if
his
whole
soul
beamed
forth
in
the
gaze
and
rested
upon
her
beauty
one
of
the
maiden
aunts
whispered
something
in
her
ear
she
made
an
effort
to
speak
her
moist
blue
eyes
were
timidly
raised
gave
a
shy
glance
at
the
stranger
and
were
cast
again
to
the
ground
her
words
died
away
but
there
was
a
sweet
smile
playing
about
her
lips
and
a
soft
dimpling
of
the
cheek
showed
that
she
was
pleased
to
meet
so
charming
a
person
the
late
hour
at
which
the
guest
had
arrived
left
no
time
for
talk
the
stranger
attempted
again
to
tell
his
sad
news
but
the
baron
would
not
listen
and
immediately
led
the
way
to
the
untasted
banquet
the
feast
was
served
in
the
great
hall
of
the
castle
around
the
walls
hung
the
portraits
of
the
bride
s
ancestors
and
the
horns
and
tusks
of
animals
they
had
killed
in
the
hunt
armor
and
spears
and
torn
banners
hung
next
to
jaws
of
wolves
and
tusks
of
boars
and
spears
and
battle
axes
a
large
pair
of
antlers
hung
just
over
the
head
of
the
youthful
bridegroom
the
stranger
took
but
little
notice
of
the
company
or
of
the
entertainment
he
scarcely
tasted
the
banquet
but
seemed
absorbed
in
admiring
the
bride
he
talked
with
her
in
a
low
tone
that
could
not
be
overheard
the
bride
s
color
came
and
went
and
she
listened
to
him
with
deep
attention
now
and
then
she
made
some
reply
but
she
was
very
quiet
most
of
the
time
and
when
his
glance
was
turned
she
looked
at
him
with
much
pleasure
they
have
fallen
in
love
at
first
sight
whispered
one
aunt
i
felt
that
it
would
be
so
said
the
other
the
feast
went
on
merrily
or
at
least
noisily
for
the
guests
were
all
blessed
with
large
appetites
the
baron
told
his
longest
and
best
stories
if
he
told
anything
marvelous
his
hearers
were
lost
in
astonishment
if
he
told
anything
funny
they
laughed
just
loud
and
long
enough
to
please
him
greatly
amidst
all
this
frolic
the
stranger
seemed
lost
in
thought
his
only
conversation
was
with
the
bride
and
seemed
to
grow
more
and
more
earnest
and
mysterious
clouds
began
to
steal
over
her
fair
face
and
the
guests
noticed
that
she
trembled
their
gayety
was
chilled
by
such
actions
the
song
and
laughter
grew
less
and
less
frequent
there
were
pauses
in
the
conversation
dismal
stories
were
told
by
several
people
the
baron
nearly
frightened
some
of
the
ladies
into
hysterics
with
the
history
of
the
ghost
horseman
that
carried
away
the
fair
young
woman
lenora
the
bridegroom
listened
to
this
tale
with
great
attention
he
kept
his
eye
fixed
on
the
baron
and
as
the
story
drew
to
a
close
began
gradually
to
rise
from
his
seat
growing
taller
and
taller
until
to
the
baron
s
eye
he
seemed
almost
to
tower
into
a
giant
the
moment
the
tale
was
finished
he
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
took
a
solemn
farewell
of
the
company
they
were
all
in
amazement
the
baron
was
perfectly
thunderstruck
what
going
to
leave
the
castle
at
midnight
why
everything
is
ready
for
your
reception
a
room
is
ready
for
you
if
you
wish
to
the
stranger
shook
his
head
mournfully
and
said
i
must
lay
my
head
in
a
different
place
then
waving
his
farewell
to
the
company
he
stalked
slowly
out
of
the
hall
the
maiden
aunts
seemed
turned
to
stone
the
bride
hung
her
head
and
a
tear
stole
down
her
cheek
the
baron
followed
the
stranger
to
the
great
court
of
the
castle
where
the
black
horse
stood
pawing
the
earth
and
snorting
with
impatience
when
they
reached
the
portal
whose
deep
high
archway
was
dimly
lighted
by
a
lantern
the
stranger
paused
and
spoke
to
the
baron
in
a
hollow
tone
of
voice
now
that
we
are
alone
said
he
i
will
tell
you
my
reason
for
leaving
i
have
an
engagement
in
why
asked
the
baron
can
not
you
send
some
one
in
your
place
i
must
keep
this
engagement
myself
i
must
go
myself
ay
said
the
baron
but
not
until
you
shall
take
your
bride
no
no
replied
the
stranger
with
greater
solemnity
my
engagement
is
with
no
bride
the
grave
awaits
me
i
must
go
back
where
i
came
from
he
sprang
upon
his
black
charger
dashed
over
the
drawbridge
and
the
sound
of
the
clatter
of
his
horse
s
hoofs
was
lost
in
the
whistling
of
the
night
s
blast
the
baron
watched
him
until
out
of
sight
then
muttered
he
must
have
been
a
ghost
he
returned
to
the
hall
in
great
bewilderment
and
related
what
had
just
passed
two
ladies
fainted
others
sickened
with
the
idea
of
having
banqueted
with
a
spectre
illustration
a
tall
figure
stood
among
the
shadows
of
the
trees
the
company
tried
to
guess
whose
ghost
it
might
have
been
some
talked
of
and
others
of
mountain
sprites
but
all
was
dim
uncertainty
and
mystery
the
next
morning
however
put
an
end
to
guessing
for
word
came
of
the
death
of
the
young
count
on
his
way
to
the
castle
and
every
one
felt
sure
that
the
stranger
of
the
night
before
was
indeed
his
spectre
you
can
imagine
how
dreadful
the
baron
felt
he
shut
himself
up
in
his
rooms
his
guests
stayed
on
for
they
could
not
think
of
going
when
he
was
in
such
trouble
and
then
too
the
remnants
of
the
feast
were
to
be
eaten
and
drunk
but
the
poor
bride
was
most
to
be
pitied
to
have
lost
a
promised
husband
before
she
was
acquainted
with
him
and
such
a
husband
everybody
wept
for
her
midnight
on
the
night
of
the
second
day
after
she
retired
to
her
room
with
one
of
her
aunts
who
insisted
upon
sleeping
with
her
the
aunt
was
one
of
the
best
tellers
of
ghost
stories
in
all
the
land
and
in
telling
one
of
her
longest
fell
asleep
in
the
midst
of
it
the
room
was
in
a
distant
corner
of
the
castle
and
overlooked
a
small
garden
the
niece
lay
gazing
at
the
beams
of
the
rising
moon
as
they
shone
on
the
trembling
leaves
of
an
aspen
tree
before
the
latticed
window
the
castle
clock
had
just
tolled
midnight
when
a
soft
strain
of
music
stole
up
from
the
garden
she
rose
hastily
from
her
bed
and
stepped
lightly
to
the
window
a
tall
figure
stood
among
the
shadows
of
the
trees
as
it
raised
its
head
a
beam
of
moonlight
fell
on
its
face
in
a
moment
she
knew
him
her
promised
bridegroom
a
loud
shriek
at
that
moment
burst
upon
her
ear
and
her
aunt
who
had
been
awakened
by
the
music
and
had
followed
her
to
the
window
fell
into
her
arms
when
she
looked
again
the
spectre
had
disappeared
of
the
two
the
aunt
required
the
more
soothing
she
was
beside
herself
with
terror
as
for
the
young
lady
she
did
not
feel
frightened
there
was
something
even
in
the
spectre
of
her
lover
very
charming
the
aunt
declared
she
would
never
sleep
in
that
room
again
the
niece
for
once
was
determined
to
have
her
own
way
and
declared
she
would
not
sleep
in
any
other
room
the
consequence
was
that
she
had
to
sleep
there
alone
she
begged
her
aunt
to
promise
not
to
tell
about
this
moonlight
visitor
for
she
said
it
was
the
only
comfort
she
had
in
her
great
disappointment
and
the
good
old
lady
promised
how
long
she
would
have
kept
her
promise
is
uncertain
for
she
dearly
loved
to
talk
about
mysterious
happenings
she
did
keep
it
to
herself
for
a
whole
week
and
then
suddenly
she
did
not
need
to
keep
it
longer
for
word
was
brought
to
the
breakfast
table
that
the
young
lady
was
not
to
be
found
her
room
was
empty
her
bed
had
not
been
slept
in
the
window
was
open
the
bird
had
flown
nearly
every
one
was
struck
speechless
when
the
aunt
who
had
slept
with
her
suddenly
regained
her
speech
and
wringing
her
hands
shrieked
out
the
goblin
the
goblin
she
s
carried
away
by
the
goblin
in
a
few
words
she
told
of
the
dreadful
scene
in
the
garden
and
all
concluded
that
the
spectre
must
have
carried
off
his
bride
two
of
the
servants
said
they
had
heard
the
clatter
of
horse
s
hoofs
down
the
about
midnight
and
had
no
doubt
it
was
the
black
charger
of
the
spectre
the
poor
baron
was
inconsolable
what
sorrow
to
have
his
only
child
his
daughter
carried
off
by
a
goblin
how
terrible
to
have
perhaps
goblin
grandchildren
as
usual
he
was
completely
bewildered
and
all
the
castle
was
in
an
uproar
the
men
were
ordered
to
take
horses
and
hunt
in
every
road
and
path
and
the
baron
himself
had
just
drawn
on
his
and
girded
on
his
sword
when
he
glanced
out
the
window
and
paused
because
of
what
he
saw
a
lady
was
approaching
the
castle
on
horseback
beside
her
mounted
on
a
black
charger
was
a
cavalier
she
galloped
up
to
the
gate
sprang
from
the
horse
and
running
into
the
castle
fell
at
the
baron
s
feet
it
was
his
lost
daughter
and
her
companion
the
spectre
bridegroom
the
baron
was
astonished
he
looked
at
his
daughter
then
at
the
spectre
and
almost
doubted
his
eyes
the
spectre
was
wonderfully
improved
in
appearance
his
dress
was
splendid
and
set
off
his
noble
figure
he
was
no
longer
pale
and
sad
his
face
was
flushed
with
the
joy
of
youth
the
mystery
was
soon
cleared
up
the
cavalier
for
you
must
have
known
all
along
he
was
no
goblin
told
the
whole
story
how
he
had
met
his
young
friend
how
they
had
traveled
together
how
the
young
nobleman
had
met
his
death
he
said
that
the
sight
of
the
beautiful
young
lady
had
made
him
forget
everything
except
the
desire
to
be
near
her
at
first
when
the
baron
would
not
listen
to
his
explanation
he
thought
it
would
do
no
harm
to
accept
the
situation
as
it
was
if
the
baron
s
family
had
not
had
a
feud
with
his
own
family
he
would
have
explained
everything
after
the
banquet
but
he
feared
that
under
the
circumstances
he
might
never
see
the
young
lady
again
when
the
baron
had
told
how
the
fair
lenora
had
been
carried
off
by
the
goblin
the
idea
of
being
a
goblin
himself
came
to
him
and
he
said
that
he
did
not
feel
exactly
right
about
doing
this
but
his
friends
had
told
him
to
remember
the
old
saying
that
everything
was
fair
in
the
baron
pardoned
the
young
couple
on
the
spot
the
festival
at
the
castle
was
continued
only
the
aunt
was
disappointed
she
who
had
told
so
many
stories
about
true
ghosts
was
embarrassed
to
find
the
only
ghost
which
she
had
actually
seen
should
turn
out
to
be
a
real
live
person
but
she
was
so
happy
at
having
her
niece
back
again
that
her
embarrassment
was
as
nothing
but
the
niece
was
perfectly
happy
in
having
found
him
a
real
living
person
and
since
they
lived
happily
ever
after
here
the
story
ends
and
another
begins
added
the
story
lady
after
a
slight
pause
at
the
story
king
s
nod
of
approval
she
proceeded
xxxi
robert
of
sicily
there
is
an
old
legend
of
a
proud
king
named
robert
of
sicily
this
legend
tells
of
the
greatest
event
of
robert
s
life
and
the
poet
longfellow
has
written
a
beautiful
poem
about
it
which
every
one
should
read
this
is
the
story
robert
king
of
sicily
was
a
very
proud
monarch
and
a
very
selfish
one
he
spent
most
of
his
time
enjoying
himself
and
gave
little
heed
to
the
wants
of
his
people
on
john
s
eve
he
attended
vesper
service
with
a
great
retinue
of
knights
and
lords
and
pages
he
was
dressed
most
magnificently
and
proudly
sat
while
the
choir
chanted
some
strange
latin
words
the
king
did
not
understand
latin
and
turning
to
a
learned
clerk
nearby
he
said
what
do
those
words
mean
the
clerk
answered
they
mean
he
has
put
down
the
mighty
from
their
seat
and
has
exalted
them
of
low
degree
the
king
laughed
scornfully
and
said
it
is
well
that
such
words
are
sung
in
latin
for
there
is
no
power
on
earth
that
can
push
me
from
my
then
he
leaned
back
yawning
and
fell
asleep
when
he
awoke
it
was
already
night
the
church
was
empty
and
all
in
darkness
the
king
was
angry
at
finding
himself
alone
he
groped
his
way
toward
the
great
doors
but
found
them
locked
then
he
thought
of
the
windows
but
they
were
high
above
his
reach
then
he
became
frightened
and
cried
aloud
he
listened
but
all
that
he
heard
was
the
resounding
echoes
of
his
cries
as
they
rang
again
and
again
through
the
high
vaulted
ceiling
of
the
church
he
knocked
with
his
fists
against
the
doors
and
swore
awful
oaths
against
every
one
in
his
court
he
became
so
angry
that
he
tore
his
magnificent
robes
into
shreds
he
had
long
since
lost
his
hat
and
cloak
at
length
the
sexton
of
the
church
heard
the
noise
and
he
thought
that
perhaps
thieves
were
breaking
into
the
church
so
he
lit
his
lantern
and
went
to
the
door
when
he
could
make
himself
heard
he
asked
who
is
there
the
king
half
choked
with
rage
answered
fiercely
open
tis
i
the
king
are
you
afraid
the
frightened
sexton
muttered
to
himself
it
is
some
drunken
beggar
or
some
one
crazy
and
turning
the
great
key
he
flung
open
the
doors
a
man
in
torn
garments
without
hat
or
cloak
rushed
past
him
he
neither
looked
at
him
nor
spoke
but
leaping
into
the
darkness
vanished
almost
like
a
spectre
from
his
sight
bareheaded
breathless
covered
with
dust
and
cobwebs
robert
strode
on
through
the
darkness
and
came
to
the
palace
gates
he
rushed
through
the
courtyard
thrusting
aside
the
guards
and
pages
and
hurried
up
the
broad
stairs
from
hall
to
hall
he
passed
in
breathless
speed
although
he
heard
voices
and
cries
to
stop
him
until
he
came
to
the
banquet
room
which
was
blazing
with
light
there
he
stood
motionless
speechless
amazed
for
on
the
throne
there
sat
another
king
wearing
his
crown
his
robes
and
even
his
signet
ring
he
looked
at
first
glance
exactly
like
king
robert
he
was
of
the
same
height
and
the
same
form
and
features
but
there
was
a
gracious
beauty
about
him
which
robert
lacked
king
robert
stood
there
gazing
at
him
in
anger
and
rage
when
he
looked
up
with
a
glance
of
surprise
and
pity
he
asked
who
are
you
robert
answered
i
am
the
king
and
i
have
come
to
take
my
place
you
are
an
imposter
who
pretends
to
be
at
these
words
the
angry
guests
sprang
up
with
drawn
swords
but
the
man
on
the
throne
said
no
not
the
king
but
the
king
s
jester
you
shall
from
now
on
wear
the
bells
and
scalloped
cape
of
the
court
jester
and
make
fun
for
us
all
your
companion
shall
be
an
then
he
turned
away
toward
his
guests
some
of
the
servants
came
forward
to
take
robert
away
and
they
were
quite
deaf
to
his
ravings
and
angry
threats
with
shouts
of
laughter
they
pushed
him
on
before
them
down
the
stairs
and
mockingly
bowed
before
him
and
pretended
to
honor
him
all
the
while
laughing
and
tittering
and
making
fun
of
him
they
left
him
in
a
room
in
the
stable
where
at
length
exhausted
he
fell
asleep
the
next
morning
waking
with
the
day
s
first
light
he
thought
to
himself
i
ve
had
an
ugly
but
the
straw
rustled
when
he
turned
his
head
and
there
were
the
jester
s
cap
and
bells
lying
near
he
heard
the
horses
champing
in
their
stalls
and
on
looking
around
the
room
saw
the
poor
ape
so
he
remembered
it
was
no
dream
his
happy
life
that
he
thought
could
not
be
changed
had
vanished
from
him
the
days
came
and
went
under
the
rule
of
the
new
king
the
island
prospered
as
never
before
robert
continued
to
be
the
jester
laughed
at
and
scorned
his
only
friend
was
the
ape
his
only
food
what
others
left
sometimes
the
other
king
would
meet
him
and
ask
are
you
still
the
king
and
always
robert
would
throw
back
his
head
and
fling
the
answer
haughtily
i
am
i
am
the
king
illustration
toward
the
very
last
robert
the
jester
rode
on
a
piebald
pony
robert
had
two
brothers
one
was
valmond
emperor
of
allemaine
the
other
was
pope
urbane
one
day
almost
three
years
after
the
wild
night
that
robert
had
been
locked
in
the
church
ambassadors
came
from
valmond
emperor
of
allemaine
bringing
letters
the
letters
asked
king
robert
to
join
his
brother
valmond
in
a
visit
to
their
brother
at
rome
the
ambassadors
were
received
with
great
pleasure
and
were
presented
with
many
beautiful
gifts
of
robes
and
jewels
then
the
king
who
was
not
king
robert
went
with
them
across
the
sea
to
italy
he
was
accompanied
by
a
great
retinue
of
knights
all
dressed
in
uniform
wearing
gay
plumes
in
their
helmets
they
rode
horses
with
jeweled
bridles
and
even
wore
golden
spurs
they
were
followed
by
pages
and
servants
and
toward
the
very
last
robert
the
jester
rode
on
a
piebald
pony
and
behind
was
perched
the
ape
through
every
town
they
went
they
made
much
fun
for
the
people
who
followed
along
after
laughing
and
poking
fun
at
them
the
company
were
received
with
great
pomp
and
ceremony
and
the
three
brothers
seemed
delighted
at
being
together
again
suddenly
robert
burst
through
the
crowd
and
running
up
to
them
cried
i
am
the
king
do
you
not
know
me
look
at
me
i
am
your
brother
robert
of
sicily
this
man
is
but
an
imposter
he
is
not
the
king
the
emperor
and
the
pope
looked
at
the
angry
worried
jester
for
a
long
moment
then
the
emperor
laughed
and
said
what
strange
sport
to
keep
a
crazy
fellow
for
a
jester
and
the
poor
baffled
jester
was
hustled
back
into
the
crowd
then
came
easter
sunday
and
the
beauty
and
the
solemnity
of
the
easter
services
touched
the
hearts
of
all
men
robert
was
deeply
moved
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
saw
what
kind
of
man
he
had
been
he
saw
how
selfish
and
proud
and
haughty
he
had
been
he
wished
with
all
his
soul
that
he
had
been
a
better
man
and
he
made
up
his
mind
that
no
matter
what
happened
he
would
never
be
so
selfish
and
mean
again
now
the
visit
ended
the
grand
visitors
left
rome
and
journeyed
homeward
and
when
they
were
once
more
established
the
king
on
the
throne
sent
for
robert
he
motioned
every
one
else
out
of
the
room
and
beckoned
robert
to
draw
near
and
when
they
were
alone
he
asked
art
thou
the
king
robert
bowed
his
head
and
folding
his
arms
said
you
know
best
i
only
know
that
i
have
sinned
and
have
been
proud
and
selfish
let
me
go
from
here
and
try
to
make
up
in
some
way
for
the
wrong
which
i
have
done
and
just
as
he
finished
saying
this
there
rose
through
the
windows
loud
and
clear
the
words
of
the
chant
he
has
put
down
the
mighty
from
their
seat
and
has
exalted
them
of
low
degree
then
the
man
who
was
with
robert
cried
joyously
i
am
not
the
king
i
am
an
angel
you
are
the
king
when
king
robert
raised
his
eyes
lo
he
was
alone
but
all
dressed
in
his
magnificent
apparel
as
of
old
and
when
his
courtiers
came
they
found
him
kneeling
upon
the
floor
in
silent
prayer
robert
was
fortunate
said
the
story
king
in
learning
his
lesson
before
it
was
too
yes
indeed
he
was
answered
the
story
lady
the
fourth
story
is
of
a
young
man
who
repented
when
it
was
too
xxxii
the
man
without
a
country
once
there
was
a
man
a
young
officer
in
the
united
states
army
who
did
a
dreadful
thing
he
cursed
his
native
country
he
pretended
for
a
while
that
he
did
not
care
when
he
was
punished
but
in
the
end
he
was
very
very
sorry
because
he
wore
his
uniform
without
the
official
buttons
the
sailors
on
the
ships
on
which
he
was
imprisoned
called
him
plain
his
name
was
philip
nolan
lieutenant
nolan
was
as
fine
a
young
officer
as
there
was
in
the
legion
of
the
west
as
the
western
division
of
the
united
states
army
was
called
in
those
early
days
one
hundred
years
ago
at
that
time
the
mississippi
valley
was
the
far
west
to
most
people
and
seemed
a
very
distant
land
indeed
there
were
a
number
of
forts
along
the
river
and
nolan
was
stationed
in
one
of
these
nolan
s
idol
was
the
brilliant
and
dashing
aaron
burr
who
visited
the
fort
several
times
between
and
he
walked
and
talked
with
nolan
and
obtained
a
very
strong
influence
over
him
he
got
nolan
to
take
him
out
in
his
skiff
and
show
him
something
of
the
great
river
and
the
plans
for
the
new
post
and
by
the
time
burr
s
visit
was
over
nolan
was
enlisted
body
and
soul
in
burr
s
disloyal
schemes
from
then
on
though
he
did
not
yet
know
it
nolan
lived
as
a
man
without
a
country
burr
soon
got
into
trouble
with
the
government
and
some
of
his
friends
were
tried
for
treason
nolan
among
them
it
became
very
plain
during
the
trial
that
nolan
would
do
anything
burr
told
him
that
he
would
obey
burr
far
quicker
than
his
country
in
spite
of
his
oath
as
an
officer
of
the
army
so
when
colonel
morgan
who
was
president
of
the
court
asked
nolan
at
the
close
of
the
trial
whether
he
wished
to
say
anything
to
show
that
he
had
always
been
faithful
to
the
united
states
he
cried
out
in
a
fit
of
frenzy
curse
the
united
states
i
wish
i
may
never
hear
of
the
united
states
again
probably
he
did
not
realize
how
the
words
would
shock
old
colonel
morgan
and
the
other
members
of
the
court
half
the
officers
who
sat
with
him
had
served
through
the
revolutionary
war
and
had
risked
their
lives
not
to
say
their
necks
cheerfully
and
loyally
for
the
country
which
nolan
so
lightly
cursed
in
his
madness
it
may
be
said
for
nolan
that
he
had
grown
up
in
the
west
of
those
days
then
an
almost
unknown
country
he
had
been
educated
on
a
plantation
where
the
most
welcome
guests
were
spanish
officers
and
french
merchants
from
orleans
who
to
say
the
least
were
unfriendly
to
the
united
states
he
had
spent
half
his
youth
with
an
older
brother
hunting
horses
in
texas
which
was
not
then
a
part
of
the
united
states
in
a
word
the
united
states
meant
almost
nothing
to
him
yet
there
was
little
excuse
for
nolan
he
had
sworn
on
his
faith
as
a
christian
to
be
true
to
the
united
states
it
was
the
united
states
which
gave
him
the
uniform
he
wore
and
the
sword
by
his
side
nay
burr
cared
nothing
for
poor
nolan
but
had
picked
him
out
to
aid
him
in
his
wicked
plots
only
because
of
the
uniform
he
wore
of
course
nolan
did
not
know
this
and
it
did
not
excuse
him
but
it
does
partly
explain
why
he
cursed
his
country
and
wished
that
he
might
never
hear
her
name
again
he
never
did
hear
her
name
but
once
again
from
that
moment
september
till
the
day
he
died
may
he
never
heard
her
name
again
for
that
and
more
he
was
a
man
without
a
country
colonel
morgan
as
you
may
suppose
was
terribly
shocked
if
nolan
had
compared
george
washington
to
benedict
arnold
or
had
cried
god
save
king
george
morgan
would
not
have
felt
worse
he
called
the
court
into
his
private
room
and
returned
in
fifteen
minutes
with
a
face
white
as
a
sheet
to
say
prisoner
hear
the
sentence
of
the
court
the
court
decides
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
president
that
you
never
hear
the
name
of
the
united
states
nolan
laughed
but
nobody
else
laughed
the
whole
room
was
hushed
dead
as
night
for
a
minute
then
colonel
morgan
added
mr
marshall
take
the
prisoner
to
orleans
in
an
armed
boat
and
deliver
him
to
the
naval
commander
there
request
him
to
order
that
no
one
shall
mention
the
united
states
to
the
prisoner
while
he
is
on
board
colonel
morgan
himself
went
to
washington
and
president
jefferson
approved
the
sentence
so
a
plan
was
formed
to
keep
nolan
constantly
at
sea
far
from
his
own
country
the
ships
of
our
navy
took
few
long
cruises
then
but
one
ship
was
directed
to
carry
the
prisoner
as
far
away
as
it
was
going
then
transfer
him
to
another
vessel
before
it
sailed
for
home
he
was
to
be
confined
only
so
far
as
necessary
to
prevent
his
escape
and
to
make
it
certain
that
he
never
saw
or
heard
of
his
country
again
as
soon
as
a
vessel
on
which
nolan
sailed
was
homeward
bound
nolan
was
transferred
to
an
vessel
for
another
cruise
at
first
he
made
light
of
it
but
in
time
he
learned
something
he
had
not
thought
of
perhaps
that
there
was
no
going
home
for
him
even
to
a
prison
there
were
some
twenty
such
transfers
which
took
him
all
over
the
world
but
which
kept
him
all
his
life
at
least
some
hundred
miles
from
the
country
he
had
hoped
he
might
never
hear
of
again
illustration
he
flung
the
book
into
the
sea
nolan
wore
his
uniform
but
with
plain
buttons
he
always
had
a
sentry
before
his
door
but
the
men
were
as
good
to
him
as
his
sentence
permitted
no
mess
wanted
to
have
him
with
them
too
steadily
because
they
could
never
talk
about
home
matters
when
he
was
present
more
than
half
the
talk
men
liked
to
have
at
sea
they
took
turns
inviting
him
to
dinner
and
the
captain
always
asked
him
on
mondays
he
could
have
any
books
or
papers
not
printed
in
america
newspapers
having
any
mention
of
america
had
to
be
gone
over
and
the
allusions
cut
out
he
used
to
join
the
men
as
they
were
reading
on
deck
and
take
his
turn
in
reading
aloud
once
when
they
were
cruising
around
the
cape
of
good
hope
somebody
got
hold
of
scott
s
lay
of
the
last
minstrel
which
was
then
new
and
famous
nolan
was
reading
to
the
others
when
he
came
to
this
passage
breathes
there
the
man
with
soul
so
dead
who
never
to
himself
hath
said
this
is
my
own
my
native
land
whose
heart
hath
ne
er
within
him
burned
as
home
his
footsteps
he
hath
turned
from
wandering
on
a
foreign
strand
if
such
there
breathe
go
mark
him
well
for
him
no
minstrel
raptures
swell
high
though
his
titles
proud
his
name
boundless
his
wealth
as
wish
can
claim
despite
those
titles
power
and
pelf
the
wretch
concentred
all
in
self
here
the
poor
fellow
choked
and
could
not
go
on
but
started
up
and
flung
the
book
into
the
sea
and
fled
to
his
stateroom
it
was
two
months
before
he
dared
join
the
men
again
there
was
a
change
in
nolan
after
this
he
never
read
aloud
again
unless
it
was
the
bible
or
shakespeare
or
something
else
he
was
sure
of
he
was
always
shy
afterwards
and
very
seldom
spoke
unless
spoken
to
except
to
a
very
few
friends
he
generally
had
the
nervous
tired
look
of
a
man
sometimes
he
tried
to
trap
people
into
mentioning
his
country
but
he
never
succeeded
his
sentence
was
too
well
known
among
the
men
who
had
him
in
charge
there
was
only
one
day
on
which
perhaps
he
was
really
happy
except
when
he
knew
his
lonely
life
was
closing
once
during
the
war
of
the
ship
on
which
he
was
staying
had
a
fight
with
an
english
frigate
a
round
shot
from
the
enemy
entered
one
of
the
ports
and
killed
the
officer
of
the
gun
himself
and
many
of
the
gun
s
crew
now
you
may
say
what
you
choose
about
courage
but
that
is
not
a
nice
thing
to
see
but
as
the
men
who
were
not
killed
picked
themselves
up
and
as
they
and
the
surgeon
s
people
were
carrying
off
the
bodies
there
appeared
nolan
in
his
shirt
sleeves
with
the
rammer
in
his
hand
and
just
as
if
he
had
been
the
officer
told
them
off
with
authority
who
should
go
to
the
with
the
wounded
men
who
should
stay
with
him
perfectly
cheery
and
with
that
way
which
makes
men
feel
sure
all
is
right
and
is
going
to
be
right
and
he
finished
loading
the
gun
with
his
own
hands
aimed
it
and
bade
the
men
fire
and
there
he
stayed
captain
of
that
gun
keeping
those
fellows
in
spirits
till
the
enemy
struck
sitting
on
the
carriage
while
the
gun
was
cooling
though
he
was
exposed
all
the
time
showing
them
easier
ways
to
handle
heavy
shot
making
the
raw
hands
laugh
at
their
own
blunders
and
when
the
gun
cooled
again
getting
it
loaded
and
fired
twice
as
often
as
any
other
gun
on
the
ship
the
commodore
walked
forward
by
way
of
encouraging
the
men
and
nolan
touched
his
hat
and
said
i
am
showing
them
how
we
do
this
in
the
artillery
i
see
you
are
and
i
thank
you
sir
the
commodore
said
and
i
shall
never
forget
this
day
sir
and
you
never
shall
and
after
the
whole
thing
was
over
and
he
had
the
englishman
s
sword
in
the
midst
of
the
state
and
ceremony
of
the
he
said
where
is
nolan
ask
nolan
to
come
and
when
nolan
came
he
said
mr
nolan
we
are
all
very
grateful
to
you
you
are
one
of
us
you
will
be
named
in
the
and
then
the
commodore
took
off
his
own
sword
of
ceremony
and
gave
it
to
nolan
and
made
him
put
it
on
nolan
cried
like
a
baby
and
well
he
might
he
had
not
worn
a
sword
since
that
infernal
day
at
fort
adams
but
always
afterwards
on
occasions
of
ceremony
he
wore
that
quaint
old
french
sword
of
the
commodore
s
the
commodore
did
mention
him
in
the
despatches
and
asked
that
he
might
be
pardoned
he
wrote
a
special
letter
to
the
secretary
of
war
but
nothing
ever
came
of
it
at
another
time
nolan
went
with
a
young
officer
named
vaughan
to
overhaul
a
dirty
little
schooner
which
had
slaves
on
board
nolan
was
the
only
one
who
could
speak
portuguese
the
language
used
by
the
slavers
there
were
but
few
of
the
negroes
vaughan
had
their
handcuffs
and
knocked
off
and
put
these
on
the
rascals
of
the
schooner
s
crew
then
nolan
told
the
blacks
that
they
were
free
and
that
vaughan
would
take
them
to
cape
palmas
now
cape
palmas
was
a
long
way
from
their
native
land
and
they
said
not
palmas
take
us
home
take
us
to
our
own
country
take
us
to
our
own
pickaninnies
and
our
own
one
complained
that
he
had
not
heard
from
home
for
more
than
six
months
it
was
terribly
hard
for
nolan
but
he
translated
these
speeches
and
told
the
negroes
vaughan
s
answer
in
some
fashion
tell
them
yes
yes
yes
vaughan
said
tell
them
they
shall
go
to
the
mountains
of
the
moon
if
they
will
if
i
sail
the
schooner
through
the
great
white
desert
they
shall
go
home
and
then
they
all
fell
to
kissing
nolan
and
wanted
to
rub
his
nose
with
theirs
as
they
were
being
rowed
back
to
the
ship
he
lay
in
the
stern
sheets
and
said
to
a
young
midshipman
of
whom
he
was
very
fond
youngster
let
that
show
you
what
it
is
to
be
without
a
family
without
a
home
and
without
a
country
and
if
you
are
ever
tempted
to
say
a
word
or
do
a
thing
that
shall
put
a
bar
between
you
and
your
family
your
home
and
your
country
pray
god
in
his
mercy
to
take
you
that
instant
home
to
his
own
heaven
stick
by
your
family
boy
forget
you
have
a
self
while
you
do
everything
for
them
think
of
your
home
boy
write
and
send
and
talk
about
it
let
it
be
nearer
and
nearer
to
your
thought
the
farther
you
have
to
travel
from
it
and
rush
back
to
it
when
you
are
free
as
that
poor
black
slave
is
doing
now
and
for
your
country
boy
and
the
words
rattled
in
his
throat
and
for
that
flag
and
he
pointed
to
the
ship
never
dream
a
dream
but
of
serving
her
as
she
bids
you
though
the
service
carry
you
through
a
thousand
hells
no
matter
what
happens
to
you
no
matter
who
flatters
you
or
who
abuses
you
never
look
at
another
flag
never
let
a
night
pass
but
you
pray
god
to
bless
that
flag
remember
boy
that
behind
all
these
men
you
have
to
do
with
behind
officers
and
government
and
people
even
there
is
the
country
herself
your
country
and
that
you
belong
to
her
as
you
belong
to
your
own
mother
stand
by
her
boy
as
you
would
stand
by
your
mother
if
those
devils
there
had
got
hold
of
her
and
then
nolan
added
almost
in
a
whisper
oh
if
anybody
had
said
so
to
me
when
i
was
of
your
age
years
passed
on
and
nolan
s
sentence
was
unrevoked
though
his
friends
had
more
than
once
asked
for
a
pardon
the
end
came
when
he
had
been
upwards
of
fifty
years
at
sea
and
he
asked
the
ship
s
doctor
for
a
visit
from
captain
danforth
whom
he
liked
danforth
tells
us
about
nolan
s
last
hours
and
calls
him
dear
old
nolan
so
we
know
his
love
was
returned
the
officer
saw
what
a
little
shrine
poor
nolan
had
made
of
his
stateroom
up
above
were
the
stars
and
stripes
and
around
a
portrait
of
washington
he
had
painted
a
majestic
eagle
with
lightnings
blazing
from
his
beak
and
his
foot
just
clasping
the
whole
globe
which
the
wings
overshadowed
nolan
said
with
a
sad
smile
here
you
see
i
have
a
country
over
the
foot
of
the
bed
was
a
great
map
of
the
united
states
drawn
from
memory
which
he
had
there
to
look
upon
as
he
lay
in
his
berth
quaint
old
names
were
on
it
in
large
letters
indiana
territory
mississippi
territory
and
louisiana
territory
danforth
he
said
i
know
i
am
dying
i
can
not
get
home
surely
you
will
tell
me
something
now
stop
stop
do
not
speak
till
i
say
what
i
am
sure
you
know
that
there
is
not
in
this
ship
that
there
is
not
in
america
god
bless
her
a
more
loyal
man
than
i
there
can
not
be
a
man
who
loves
the
old
flag
or
prays
for
it
as
i
do
there
are
stars
in
it
now
danforth
i
thank
god
for
that
though
i
do
not
know
what
their
names
are
there
has
never
been
one
taken
away
i
thank
god
for
that
but
tell
me
something
tell
me
everything
danforth
before
i
die
captain
danforth
in
writing
about
it
afterwards
says
i
felt
like
a
monster
that
i
had
not
told
him
everything
before
though
obeying
orders
who
was
i
that
i
should
have
been
acting
the
tyrant
all
this
time
over
this
dear
sainted
old
man
who
had
expiated
in
his
whole
manhood
s
life
the
madness
of
a
boy
s
mr
nolan
he
said
i
will
tell
you
everything
you
ask
then
he
told
him
the
names
of
all
the
new
states
and
drew
them
in
on
the
map
he
told
him
of
the
inventions
the
steamboats
the
railroads
and
telegraphs
he
tried
to
tell
him
all
that
had
happened
to
the
great
and
growing
country
in
fifty
years
he
told
him
about
abraham
lincoln
who
was
then
president
except
that
he
could
not
wound
his
friend
by
mentioning
a
word
about
the
cruel
civil
war
which
was
then
raging
nolan
drank
it
in
and
enjoyed
it
more
than
we
can
tell
after
that
he
seemed
to
grow
weary
and
said
he
would
go
to
sleep
he
bent
danforth
down
and
kissed
him
and
then
said
look
in
my
bible
captain
when
i
am
danforth
went
away
with
no
thought
that
this
was
the
end
but
in
an
hour
when
the
doctor
went
in
gently
he
found
nolan
had
breathed
away
his
life
with
a
smile
they
looked
in
his
bible
and
there
was
a
slip
of
paper
at
the
place
where
he
had
marked
the
text
they
desire
a
country
even
a
heavenly
wherefore
god
is
not
ashamed
to
be
called
their
god
for
he
hath
prepared
for
them
a
on
this
slip
of
paper
he
had
written
bury
me
in
the
sea
it
has
been
my
home
and
i
love
it
but
will
not
some
one
set
up
a
stone
for
my
memory
at
fort
adams
or
at
orleans
that
my
disgrace
may
not
be
more
than
i
ought
to
bear
say
on
it
in
memory
of
philip
nolan
lieutenant
in
the
army
of
the
united
states
he
loved
his
country
as
no
other
man
has
loved
her
but
no
man
deserved
less
at
her
xxxiii
your
flag
and
my
flag
when
the
story
was
finished
the
story
people
did
not
applaud
they
felt
sorry
for
poor
philip
who
had
repented
so
bitterly
mary
frances
felt
sad
and
sorry
too
as
she
did
every
time
she
heard
the
story
for
she
had
often
heard
it
before
how
americans
love
their
country
said
the
story
king
they
must
love
it
as
much
as
we
love
our
island
indeed
they
do
love
it
answered
mary
frances
patriotically
i
think
it
s
the
greatest
big
country
in
all
the
world
the
story
people
smiled
and
clapped
their
hands
at
this
speech
for
they
admire
loyalty
wherever
shown
yes
it
is
said
the
story
queen
and
we
think
our
island
is
the
greatest
little
country
in
all
the
so
it
is
indeed
it
is
i
love
it
next
to
my
own
cried
mary
frances
and
the
story
people
applauded
again
there
is
a
little
poem
about
the
stars
and
stripes
that
is
very
popular
in
america
said
the
story
lady
smiling
now
that
the

the

as
mary
frances
sat
down
the
story
people
clapped
their
hands
enthusiastically
and
the
ready
writer
handed
her
her
copies
of
the
stories
for
the
day
the
copy
of
the
poem
which
he
had
made
he
kept
for
themselves
as
mary
frances
and
the
story
lady
were
going
out
the
story
queen
stopped
them
and
said
we
shall
expect
you
both
to
dinner
just
a
little
family
party
you
oh
thank
you
that
will
be
delightful
both
replied
mary
frances
thought
ruefully
of
her
best
dress
hanging
uselessly
in
the
closet
at
home
and
wished
she
had
it
but
it
s
no
use
wishing
she
thought
it
s
all
so
however
with
the
help
of
the
story
lady
she
was
arrayed
for
the
occasion
and
when
she
saw
herself
in
the
mirror
she
said
there
must
be
two
of
us
that
doesn
t
look
like
but
it
was
she
so
when
they
left
their
apartments
and
went
downstairs
into
the
she
was
in
very
high
spirits
mary
frances
had
eaten
many
dinners
but
never
one
like
that
yet
strange
to
say
she
doesn
t
remember
what
she
ate
but
she
does
remember
how
kind
and
friendly
the
story
king
and
queen
were
and
how
they
plied
her
with
questions
about
her
own
country
she
thinks
perhaps
she
bragged
a
little
too
much
in
telling
of
its
wonders
but
she
excuses
herself
to
herself
thinking
well
my
country
is
worth
bragging
about
i
m
during
a
lull
in
the
conversation
mary
frances
asked
the
king
won
t
you
tell
me
where
all
the
stories
come
from
with
pleasure
he
replied
they
come
from
all
countries
the
world
is
full
of
people
who
are
doing
brave
and
noble
deeds
and
when
we
hear
of
such
deeds
we
have
them
written
down
and
pass
them
of
course
he
added
there
are
other
people
who
are
doing
cowardly
and
selfish
things
but
we
don
t
bother
with
them
except
to
punish
them
as
we
did
the
pirate
we
see
to
it
that
no
good
story
is
ever
lost
that
is
why
we
were
so
concerned
about
the
lost
you
can
see
said
the
queen
that
it
keeps
us
pretty
indeed
it
must
returned
mary
frances
i
think
it
s
very
kind
of
you
to
let
me
visit
dear
child
said
the
queen
we
shall
make
a
story
about
it
several
stories
yes
delightful
stories
interrupted
the
story
lady
and
i
shall
tell
them
oh
yes
i
shall
tell
them
the
last
day
on
story
island
the
cricket
on
the
hearth
a
fairy
tale
of
chirp
the
chirp
the
chirp
the
the
return
home
the
last
day
on
story
island
the
cricket
on
the
hearth
xxxiv
chirp
the
first
when
the
story
people
were
all
assembled
the
story
lady
began
we
have
only
one
story
the
cricket
on
the
hearth
which
was
first
told
by
one
of
our
greatest
charles
dickens
who
wrote
the
christmas
carol
and
many
other
stories
that
children
love
to
heyday
the
cricket
s
merrier
than
ever
i
think
said
john
stopping
in
his
slow
way
to
listen
to
its
musical
chirp
chirp
chirp
and
it
s
sure
to
bring
us
good
fortune
john
it
always
has
done
so
to
have
a
cricket
on
the
hearth
is
the
luckiest
thing
in
the
world
that
is
what
john
peerybingle
s
little
wife
dot
said
one
stormy
night
after
john
had
come
in
from
delivering
packages
and
boxes
and
she
had
given
him
his
tea
and
had
put
the
baby
to
sleep
for
john
peerybingle
was
a
local
expressman
or
as
they
say
in
england
a
carrier
the
first
time
i
heard
its
cheerful
little
note
john
dot
continued
was
the
night
you
brought
me
home
when
you
brought
me
to
my
new
home
here
its
little
mistress
nearly
a
year
ago
you
recollect
john
oh
yes
john
remembered
i
should
think
so
its
chirp
was
such
a
welcome
to
me
it
seemed
so
full
of
promise
and
encouragement
it
seemed
to
say
you
would
be
kind
and
gentle
with
me
and
would
not
expect
to
find
an
old
head
on
the
shoulders
of
your
foolish
little
wife
i
had
a
fear
of
that
john
john
thoughtfully
patted
one
of
the
shoulders
and
then
the
head
of
his
little
wife
as
though
to
say
no
no
he
had
no
such
expectation
he
had
been
quite
content
to
take
them
as
they
the
cricket
spoke
the
truth
john
for
you
have
been
i
am
sure
the
most
considerate
the
most
affectionate
of
husbands
this
has
been
a
happy
home
john
and
i
love
the
cricket
for
its
why
so
do
i
then
said
the
carrier
so
do
i
i
love
it
for
the
many
times
i
have
heard
it
dot
went
on
musing
and
the
many
thoughts
its
harmless
music
has
given
me
sometimes
in
the
twilight
when
i
have
felt
a
little
john
before
the
precious
baby
came
to
keep
me
company
and
make
the
house
gay
when
i
have
thought
how
lonely
you
would
be
if
i
should
die
or
i
should
be
if
you
should
die
its
chirp
chirp
chirp
upon
the
hearth
has
filled
me
with
new
trust
and
confidence
for
you
see
john
i
was
afraid
being
so
much
younger
than
you
that
you
might
not
find
me
at
all
suitable
as
a
wife
and
that
you
might
find
it
hard
to
learn
to
love
me
as
you
would
if
i
were
older
and
had
had
more
experience
i
was
thinking
just
before
you
came
in
dear
how
the
cricket
has
cheered
me
at
such
times
and
i
love
it
for
their
and
so
do
i
repeated
john
but
dot
how
you
talk
i
learn
to
love
you
i
had
learned
that
long
before
i
brought
you
here
to
be
the
cricket
s
little
mistress
she
laid
her
hand
an
instant
on
his
arm
and
looked
up
at
him
as
if
she
would
have
told
him
something
next
moment
she
was
down
upon
her
knees
before
the
basket
of
packages
which
john
had
brought
in
from
his
cart
perhaps
some
of
them
would
be
called
for
the
others
he
would
deliver
in
the
morning
there
are
not
many
of
them
john
why
what
s
this
round
box
heart
alive
john
it
s
a
leave
a
woman
to
find
that
out
said
john
admiringly
now
a
man
would
never
have
thought
of
it
but
it
s
my
belief
that
if
you
packed
a
wedding
cake
in
a
or
in
a
feather
bed
or
in
a
woman
would
be
sure
to
find
it
out
directly
yes
i
called
for
it
at
the
and
it
weighs
i
don
t
know
what
whole
hundred
weights
cried
dot
making
a
great
show
of
trying
to
lift
it
whose
is
it
john
where
is
it
going
read
the
writing
on
the
other
side
said
john
why
john
my
goodness
john
exclaimed
dot
ah
who
d
have
thought
it
john
returned
you
never
mean
to
say
asked
dot
sitting
on
the
floor
and
shaking
her
head
at
him
that
it
s
for
gruff
and
tackleton
the
john
nodded
peerybingle
nodded
also
fifty
times
at
least
in
dumb
and
pitying
amazement
and
tilly
slowboy
the
and
helper
of
all
work
began
to
talk
in
an
undertone
to
the
baby
who
had
awakened
as
she
walked
to
and
fro
with
him
in
her
arms
was
it
for
gruffs
and
tackletons
then
and
would
it
call
at
the
for
wedding
cakes
and
did
its
mothers
know
the
boxes
when
its
fathers
brought
them
home
and
so
on
and
that
marriage
is
really
to
come
about
said
dot
after
seeing
that
the
baby
was
all
right
why
she
and
i
were
girls
at
school
together
john
might
have
been
thinking
of
how
dot
looked
then
but
he
made
no
answer
and
he
s
as
old
as
unlike
may
why
how
many
years
older
than
you
is
gruff
and
tackleton
john
how
many
more
cups
of
tea
shall
i
drink
at
one
sitting
than
gruff
and
tackleton
ever
took
in
four
sittings
i
wonder
replied
john
but
even
this
brought
no
smile
to
the
face
of
his
little
wife
the
cricket
too
had
stopped
somehow
the
room
was
not
so
cheerful
as
it
had
been
nothing
like
it
strange
old
so
these
are
all
the
parcels
are
they
john
she
asked
after
a
little
while
so
these
are
all
the
parcels
john
that
s
all
said
john
why
no
i
i
declare
i
ve
clean
forgotten
the
old
gentleman
the
old
gentleman
in
the
cart
said
john
he
was
asleep
down
in
the
straw
the
last
time
i
saw
him
i
ve
very
nearly
remembered
him
twice
since
i
came
in
but
he
went
out
of
my
head
john
hastily
rose
and
lighting
a
candle
went
out
the
door
halloa
yahip
there
rouse
up
that
s
my
hearty
he
called
as
he
made
his
way
to
the
soon
the
stranger
stood
bareheaded
and
motionless
in
the
middle
of
the
room
he
had
long
white
hair
good
features
singularly
bold
and
for
an
old
man
his
eyes
were
dark
and
bright
and
smiling
he
saluted
the
carrier
s
wife
by
gravely
bowing
his
clothes
were
very
quaint
and
a
long
long
way
behind
the
time
their
color
was
brown
all
over
in
his
hand
he
carried
a
great
brown
club
or
he
struck
this
upon
the
floor
and
it
fell
open
and
became
a
chair
on
which
he
sat
down
quite
composedly
there
said
the
carrier
turning
to
his
wife
that
s
the
way
i
found
him
sitting
by
the
roadside
upright
as
a
milestone
and
almost
as
deaf
as
one
sitting
in
the
open
air
john
in
the
open
air
replied
the
carrier
just
at
dusk
will
you
take
me
along
he
asked
and
gave
me
eighteen
pence
then
he
got
into
the
cart
and
here
he
he
s
going
john
i
think
illustration
if
you
please
i
was
to
be
left
till
called
for
not
at
all
he
was
only
going
to
speak
if
you
please
i
was
to
be
left
till
called
for
said
the
stranger
mildly
don
t
mind
with
that
he
took
a
pair
of
spectacles
from
one
of
his
large
pockets
and
a
book
from
another
and
leisurely
began
to
read
boxer
the
carrier
s
big
dog
came
sniffing
at
his
legs
but
he
took
no
more
notice
of
boxer
than
if
he
had
been
a
lamb
the
carrier
and
his
wife
glanced
at
each
other
in
perplexity
the
stranger
raised
his
head
and
looking
from
dot
toward
john
said
your
daughter
my
good
friend
wife
said
john
niece
asked
the
stranger
wife
roared
john
indeed
observed
the
stranger
surely
very
young
dot
took
the
baby
from
the
couch
where
tilly
slowboy
had
laid
him
the
stranger
quietly
resumed
his
reading
but
before
he
had
read
two
lines
he
interrupted
his
reading
to
say
to
john
baby
yours
john
gave
a
gigantic
nod
equal
to
an
answer
given
through
a
speaking
trumpet
girl
asked
the
stranger
roared
john
also
very
young
eh
peerybingle
instantly
spoke
two
months
and
three
vaccinated
just
six
weeks
took
very
considered
by
the
doctors
a
remarkably
beautiful
equal
to
the
general
run
of
children
at
five
months
takes
notice
of
everything
may
seem
impossible
to
you
but
here
the
breathless
little
mother
who
had
been
shrieking
these
short
sentences
into
the
old
man
s
ear
until
her
face
was
crimson
held
the
baby
up
before
him
to
prove
her
words
while
tilly
slowboy
sprang
around
in
gambols
to
amuse
the
infant
uttering
words
which
sounded
like
ketcher
ketcher
hark
said
john
he
s
called
for
sure
enough
there
s
some
one
at
the
door
open
it
before
she
could
reach
it
however
it
was
opened
from
the
outside
for
it
was
a
primitive
sort
of
door
with
a
latch
that
any
one
could
lift
if
he
chose
in
came
a
little
meager
thoughtful
man
he
seemed
to
have
made
himself
a
from
the
burlap
covering
of
some
old
box
for
when
he
turned
to
shut
the
door
and
keep
the
weather
out
one
could
read
upon
the
back
of
the
garment
the
letters
g
t
in
large
black
capitals
also
the
word
glass
in
smaller
capitals
john
said
the
little
man
mum
tilly
unbeknown
how
s
baby
mum
boxer
s
pretty
well
i
hope
all
well
and
thriving
caleb
replied
dot
i
am
sure
you
need
only
look
at
the
dear
child
for
one
to
know
and
i
m
sure
i
only
need
look
at
you
for
another
said
caleb
or
at
john
for
another
or
tilly
as
far
as
that
goes
or
certainly
at
busy
just
now
caleb
asked
the
carrier
why
pretty
busy
john
he
returned
pretty
much
so
there
s
a
lot
of
demand
for
noah
s
arks
at
present
i
d
like
to
be
able
to
take
more
pains
in
making
the
families
but
i
can
t
do
it
at
the
price
it
would
be
a
satisfaction
though
to
one
s
mind
to
make
it
plain
which
was
shems
and
hams
and
which
was
wives
ah
well
have
you
got
anything
in
the
parcel
line
for
me
john
the
carrier
put
his
hand
into
the
pocket
of
the
coat
he
had
taken
off
and
brought
out
a
tiny
carefully
wrapped
in
moss
and
tissue
paper
there
it
is
he
said
adjusting
it
with
great
care
not
so
much
as
a
leaf
damaged
full
of
buds
caleb
s
dull
eye
brightened
as
he
took
it
and
thanked
him
it
was
expensive
caleb
said
the
carrier
very
dear
at
this
never
mind
that
it
would
be
cheap
to
me
whatever
it
cost
returned
the
little
man
anything
else
john
a
small
box
replied
the
carrier
here
you
are
for
caleb
plummer
read
the
old
man
spelling
out
the
directions
with
cash
with
cash
john
i
don
t
think
it
s
for
me
with
care
corrected
the
carrier
looking
over
his
shoulder
where
do
you
make
out
cash
oh
to
be
sure
said
caleb
it
s
all
right
with
care
yes
yes
that
s
mine
it
might
have
been
with
cash
if
my
dear
boy
in
south
america
had
lived
john
you
loved
him
like
a
son
didn
t
you
you
needn
t
say
you
did
i
know
of
he
read
again
caleb
plummer
with
yes
yes
it
s
all
right
it
s
a
box
of
dolls
eyes
for
my
daughter
s
work
i
wish
it
was
her
own
sight
in
a
box
john
i
wish
it
was
or
could
be
cried
the
carrier
thankee
said
the
little
man
you
speak
very
hearty
to
think
that
she
should
never
see
the
dolls
and
them
a
staring
at
her
so
bold
all
day
long
that
s
where
it
cuts
what
s
the
cost
john

carrier

for
our
governor
eh
asked
caleb
after
thinking
a
little
while
to
be
sure
that

what
i
came
for
but
my
head
s
so
full
of
them
noah
s
arks
and
things
he
hasn
t
been
here
has
he
not
he
returned
the
carrier
he
s
too
busy
he
s
coming
though
said
caleb
for
he
told
me
to
keep
on
the
near
side
of
the
road
going
home
and
it
was
ten
to
one
he
d
take
me
up
i
d
better
go
he
turned
to
dot
you
couldn
t
have
the
goodness
to
let
me
pinch
boxer
s
tail
mum
for
half
a
moment
could
you
why
caleb
what
a
question
oh
never
mind
mum
said
the
little
man
he
mightn
t
like
it
perhaps
there
s
a
small
order
come
in
for
toys
dogs
that
will
bark
and
i
wish
to
go
as
close
to
nature
as
possible
for
a
sixpence
that
s
all
never
mind
it
happened
that
boxer
just
at
that
moment
began
to
bark
with
zeal
but
as
this
bark
meant
the
approach
of
some
new
visitor
caleb
postponing
his
study
of
dogs
barks
shouldered
the
big
round
box
of
wedding
cake
and
said
he
might
have
spared
himself
the
trouble
however
for
he
met
his
employer
upon
the
threshold
oh
you
are
here
are
you
wait
a
bit
i
ll
take
you
home
he
turned
to
john
john
peerybingle
my
service
to
you
more
of
my
service
to
your
pretty
wife
handsomer
every
day
and
younger
i
should
be
astonished
at
your
paying
compliments
tackleton
said
dot
not
altogether
pleasantly
but
for
what
i
have
just
heard
about
you
being
engaged
to
be
you
know
all
about
it
then
i
have
gotten
myself
to
believe
it
somehow
said
dot
after
a
hard
struggle
i
suppose
tackleton
the
toy
merchant
was
well
known
in
the
neighborhood
many
people
called
him
gruff
and
tackleton
the
name
of
the
firm
when
gruff
was
tackleton
s
partner
although
tackleton
had
bought
out
gruff
s
interest
years
before
the
name
still
remained
it
was
odd
that
such
a
man
should
have
been
a
for
he
had
no
interest
in
toys
whatever
he
despised
them
and
wouldn
t
have
bought
one
for
the
world
the
only
toys
in
his
shop
which
he
could
abide
were
the
ugly
ones
hideous
vampire
kites
and
fiery
dragons
really
did
give
him
some
pleasure
for
he
saw
that
they
scared
little
children
a
very
pleasant
person
tackleton
not
the
kind
of
person
you
would
think
was
going
to
be
married
and
to
a
young
wife
too
a
beautiful
young
wife
he
didn
t
look
much
like
a
bridegroom
as
he
stood
in
the
carrier
s
kitchen
with
a
twist
in
his
dry
face
and
a
screw
in
his
body
and
his
hat
jerked
over
the
bridge
of
his
nose
and
his
hands
tucked
down
into
the
bottom
of
his
pockets
and
his
whole
sarcastic
self
peering
out
of
one
little
corner
of
one
little
eye
like
the
concentrated
essence
of
any
number
of
ravens
but
a
bridegroom
he
was
designed
to
be
in
three
days
time
next
thursday
the
last
day
of
the
first
month
of
the
year
is
my
wedding
day
said
tackleton
did
i
mention
that
he
had
always
one
eye
wide
open
and
one
eye
nearly
shut
and
the
eye
nearly
shut
was
always
the
expressive
eye
i
don
t
think
i
did
that
s
my
said
tackleton
rattling
his
money
in
his
pocket
why
that
s
the
anniversary
of
our
wedding
too
exclaimed
the
carrier
ha
ha
laughed
tackleton
odd
you
re
just
such
another
couple
as
we
will
be
just
at
this
speech
dot
was
most
indignant
what
next
would
the
man
say
as
though
her
john
resembled
tackleton
in
any
particular
i
say
a
word
with
you
murmured
tackleton
nudging
the
carrier
with
his
elbow
and
taking
him
off
a
little
way
you
ll
come
to
the
wedding
won
t
you
we
re
in
the
same
boat
you
how
in
the
same
boat
asked
john
why
you
re
not
so
youthful
as
your
wife
yourself
said
tackleton
with
another
nudge
come
and
spend
an
evening
with
us
why
demanded
john
astonished
at
this
hospitality
why
returned
the
other
that
s
a
new
way
to
receive
an
invitation
why
for
pleasure
to
be
sociable
you
know
and
all
i
thought
you
were
never
sociable
said
john
in
his
plain
way
as
you
like
what
does
it
matter
your
company
will
produce
a
favorable
impression
on
tackleton
you
ll
say
you
ll
come
we
have
arranged
to
keep
our
wedding
day
at
home
said
john
we
think
you
see
that
home
bah
what
s
home
cried
tackleton
four
walls
and
a
ceiling
why
don
t
you
kill
that
cricket
i
would
i
always
do
i
hate
their
noise
you
ll
say
you
ll
come
evening

kill
the
crickets
eh
said
john
scrunch
em
sir
returned
the
other
setting
his
heel
heavily
on
the
floor
then
you
won
t
give
us
evening
well
next
day
you
go
out
visiting
i
know
i
ll
meet
you
there
and
bring
my
wife
it
ll
do
her
good
you
re
agreeable
thankee
what
s
that
is
it
was
a
loud
cry
from
the
carrier
s
wife
a
loud
sharp
sudden
cry
that
made
the
room
ring
like
a
glass
bell
that
was
struck
she
had
risen
from
her
seat
and
stood
like
one
transfixed
by
terror
and
surprise
the
stranger
had
gone
toward
the
fire
to
warm
himself
but
he
was
quite
still
dot
cried
the
carrier
darling
dot
what
s
the
matter
they
were
all
about
her
in
a
moment
caleb
who
had
been
dozing
on
the
in
the
first
start
seized
tilly
slowboy
by
the
hair
but
immediately
apologized
mary
exclaimed
the
carrier
for
dot
s
real
name
was
mary
dot
being
only
a
pet
name
of
her
husband
s
mary
dear
are
you
ill
what
is
it
tell
me
but
at
first
she
could
not
answer
she
wept
bitterly
and
covered
her
face
with
her
apron
then
burst
into
a
wild
fit
of
laughter
and
then
started
crying
again
at
length
she
let
john
lead
her
to
the
fire
where
she
sat
down
the
old
man
was
standing
there
as
before
i
m
better
john
she
said
i
m
quite
well
it
was
only
a
fancy
something
coming
before
my
eyes
it
s
gone
quite
gone
but
why
did
she
look
at
the
old
gentleman
as
if
addressing
him
thought
john
was
her
mind
wandering
i
m
glad
it
s
gone
muttered
tackleton
turning
the
expressive
eye
around
the
room
i
wonder
where
it
s
gone
and
what
it
was
humph
caleb
come
here
who
s
that
man
with
the
gray
hair
i
don
t
know
sir
caleb
answered
in
a
whisper
never
saw
him
before
in
all
my
life
he
d
make
a
beautiful
figure
for
a
quite
a
new
not
ugly
enough
said
tackleton
or
a
caleb
continued
what
a
model
unscrew
his
head
to
put
the
matches
in
let
them
fall
down
to
his
neck
and
take
not
half
ugly
enough
said
tackleton
nothing
in
him
at
all
come
bring
that
box
all
right
now
i
hope
peerybingle
oh
quite
right
quite
right
said
the
little
woman
waving
him
hurriedly
away
said
tackleton
john
peerybingle
take
care
how
you
carry
that
box
caleb
let
it
fall
and
i
ll
murder
you
dark
as
pitch
and
weather
worse
than
ever
eh
so
with
another
sharp
look
round
the
room
he
went
out
the
door
followed
by
caleb
with
the
wedding
cake
on
his
head
the
carrier
had
been
so
much
astonished
by
his
little
wife
and
so
busily
trying
to
sooth
her
that
he
had
scarcely
been
conscious
of
the
stranger
s
presence
until
now
when
he
looked
up
and
saw
him
standing
there
their
only
guest
he
don
t
belong
to
them
you
see
said
john
i
must
give
him
a
hint
to
just
at
that
moment
the
old
gentleman
came
toward
him
saying
i
beg
your
pardon
friend
but
since
my
attendant
has
not
come
and
the
weather
is
so
bad
can
you
in
your
kindness
let
me
rent
a
bed
here
yes
yes
cried
dot
yes
certainly
oh
exclaimed
the
carrier
surprised
by
the
quickness
of
her
consent
well
i
don
t
object
still
i
m
not
quite
sure
hush
she
interrupted
dear
john
why
he
s
stone
deaf
urged
john
i
know
but
she
turned
to
the
stranger
yes
sir
certainly
yes
certainly
then
to
john
i
ll
make
him
up
a
bed
directly
as
she
hurried
off
to
do
it
the
fluttering
way
she
did
it
was
so
strange
that
the
carrier
looked
after
her
quite
dumfounded
did
its
mothers
make
up
a
beds
then
cried
tilly
slowboy
to
the
baby
and
did
its
hair
grow
brown
and
curly
when
its
caps
was
lifted
off
and
frighten
it
as
precious
pets
by
the
fire
what
frightened
dot
i
wonder
thought
the
carrier
pacing
to
and
fro
and
half
listening
to
tilly
s
silly
chatter
the
bed
was
soon
made
ready
and
the
stranger
who
would
not
take
anything
but
a
cup
of
tea
retired
after
dot
put
the
baby
to
bed
she
arranged
the
great
comfortable
fireside
chair
for
the
carrier
and
filled
his
pipe
for
him
then
she
brought
her
little
stool
and
placing
it
beside
his
knee
sat
down
for
a
cozy
chat
but
the
carrier
fell
to
dreaming
and
boxer
who
was
stretched
at
his
feet
i
am
quite
ashamed
to
say
snored
aloud
just
then
the
cricket
began
its
song
and
dot
too
fell
but
what
was
that
young
figure
of
a
man
which
remained
there
singly
and
alone
why
did
it
linger
still
so
near
her
with
its
arm
upon
the
ever
repeating
in
a
whisper
married
and
not
to
me
xxxv
chirp
the
second
the
blind
girl
and
her
caleb
plummer
the
and
his
blind
daughter
lived
all
alone
by
themselves
as
the
story
books
say
in
a
little
cracked
nutshell
of
a
wooden
house
close
to
the
big
establishment
of
gruff
and
tackleton
the
toy
merchants
i
have
said
that
caleb
and
his
poor
blind
daughter
lived
here
i
should
have
said
that
caleb
lived
here
and
his
poor
blind
daughter
lived
somewhere
else
in
a
sort
of
enchanted
fairyland
where
no
shabbiness
or
poverty
or
trouble
ever
entered
for
caleb
in
the
magic
of
his
devoted
deathless
love
for
his
daughter
played
a
little
game
of
pretend
which
made
the
blind
girl
think
their
home
beautiful
her
father
rich
and
handsome
and
that
nothing
was
lacking
which
they
needed
the
blind
girl
never
knew
that
the
ceilings
were
broken
and
the
walls
blotched
and
bare
of
plaster
here
and
there
the
beams
warped
and
bending
because
of
age
the
blind
girl
never
knew
that
the
woodwork
was
rotting
and
the
paper
peeling
off
the
walls
and
the
little
building
withering
away
the
blind
girl
never
knew
that
the
dishes
were
ugly
and
cracked
and
the
carpets
threadbare
that
sorrow
and
were
in
the
house
that
caleb
s
scanty
hairs
were
turning
grayer
and
more
gray
before
her
sightless
face
the
blind
girl
never
knew
that
they
had
a
master
cold
exacting
and
not
caring
how
they
got
along
never
knew
that
tackleton
was
tackleton
in
fact
for
caleb
led
her
to
think
his
rough
words
were
meant
for
jokes
that
he
was
very
good
to
them
and
had
a
peculiarity
in
that
he
could
not
bear
to
be
thanked
for
any
favor
he
had
done
you
know
why
he
did
this
it
was
because
he
felt
so
sorry
for
poor
blind
bertha
that
he
deceived
her
into
thinking
everything
lovely
and
fair
in
order
that
she
might
be
happier
he
too
had
had
a
cricket
singing
on
the
hearth
when
his
motherless
girl
was
very
young
and
when
he
listened
to
its
music
he
made
up
his
mind
to
cheer
the
little
one
s
dark
way
by
every
means
he
could
devise
caleb
and
his
daughter
were
at
work
together
in
their
usual
working
room
which
served
them
for
their
ordinary
living
room
as
well
and
a
strange
place
it
was
there
were
houses
in
it
furnished
and
unfurnished
for
dolls
of
all
stations
in
life
nice
houses
for
dolls
of
moderate
means
smaller
houses
for
dolls
not
so
well
off
fine
town
residences
for
dolls
of
high
estate
some
of
the
houses
were
already
furnished
with
a
view
to
the
conveniences
of
dolls
of
limited
income
others
could
be
furnished
on
notice
from
the
shelves
nearby
which
were
full
of
chairs
and
tables
sofas
bedsteads
and
other
articles
of
furniture
then
there
were
many
dolls
themselves
of
all
kinds
and
from
all
stations
in
life
there
were
various
other
samples
of
his
handicraft
besides
dolls
and
dolls
houses
in
caleb
plummer
s
room
there
were
noah
s
arks
in
which
the
birds
and
beasts
were
an
uncommonly
tight
fit
i
assure
you
there
were
scores
of
little
carts
which
when
the
wheels
went
round
performed
most
doleful
music
there
were
small
fiddles
and
drums
and
no
end
of
cannon
shields
and
spears
there
were
little
fellows
in
red
breeches
who
would
tumble
down
head
first
along
a
piece
of
tape
there
were
old
gentlemen
dolls
who
would
fly
over
trapeze
bars
when
pressed
in
the
right
place
there
were
beasts
of
all
sorts
horses
in
particular
of
every
breed
from
the
little
spotted
gray
on
four
legs
to
the
thoroughbred
rocked
on
his
highest
mettle
illustration
there
were
houses
in
it
furnished
and
unfurnished
for
dolls
of
all
stations
in
life
there
were
dozens
and
dozens
of
other
little
toys
but
you
already
can
imagine
how
the
room
looked
in
the
midst
of
all
these
objects
caleb
and
his
daughter
sat
at
work
the
blind
girl
busy
as
a
doll
s
dressmaker
caleb
painting
a
desirable
doll
s
family
mansion
so
you
were
out
in
the
rain
last
night
father
in
your
beautiful
new
said
caleb
s
daughter
in
my
beautiful
new
answered
caleb
glancing
toward
a
in
the
room
on
which
the
burlap
garment
was
carefully
hung
to
dry
how
glad
i
am
you
bought
it
father
and
such
a
stylish
tailor
it
s
too
good
for
me
said
caleb
the
blind
girl
rested
from
her
work
and
laughed
with
delight
too
good
father
what
can
be
too
good
for
you
i
m
half
ashamed
to
wear
it
though
said
caleb
watching
the
effect
of
what
he
said
on
her
brightening
face
upon
my
word
when
i
hear
the
boys
and
people
say
behind
me
hallo
here
s
a
swell
i
don
t
know
which
way
to
look
and
when
the
beggar
wouldn
t
go
away
last
night
and
when
i
said
i
am
a
very
common
man
said
no
your
honor
bless
your
honor
don
t
say
that
i
was
quite
ashamed
i
really
felt
as
if
i
hadn
t
a
right
to
wear
happy
blind
girl
how
merry
she
was
with
the
idea
i
see
you
father
she
said
clasping
her
hands
as
plainly
as
if
i
had
the
eyes
i
never
want
when
you
are
with
me
a
blue
coat
bright
blue
said
caleb
yes
yes
bright
blue
exclaimed
the
girl
turning
up
her
radiant
face
the
color
i
can
just
remember
in
the
blessed
sky
you
told
me
it
was
blue
before
a
bright
blue
coat
made
loose
to
the
figure
suggested
caleb
yes
loose
to
the
figure
cried
the
blind
girl
laughing
heartily
and
in
it
you
dear
father
with
your
merry
eye
your
smiling
face
your
free
step
and
your
dark
hair
looking
so
young
and
handsome
there
there
said
caleb
i
shall
be
vain
i
think
you
are
already
cried
the
blind
girl
pointing
at
him
in
her
glee
i
know
you
father
ha
ha
ha
i
ve
found
you
out
you
see
how
different
the
picture
in
her
mind
from
caleb
as
he
sat
observing
her
she
had
spoken
of
his
free
step
she
was
right
in
that
for
years
and
years
he
had
never
once
crossed
their
threshold
with
his
own
slow
pace
but
with
a
footfall
free
and
sprightly
for
her
to
hear
and
never
even
when
his
heart
was
heaviest
had
he
forgotten
the
light
tread
that
was
to
render
her
own
so
cheerful
and
courageous
there
we
are
said
caleb
falling
back
a
step
or
two
to
better
judge
his
work
it
s
a
pity
the
whole
front
of
this
doll
s
house
opens
at
once
if
there
was
only
a
staircase
in
it
now
and
regular
doors
to
go
in
at
but
that
s
the
worst
of
my
work
i
m
always
trying
to
make
believe
you
are
speaking
quite
softly
are
you
tired
father
tired
echoed
caleb
with
a
great
burst
of
enthusiasm
what
should
tire
me
bertha
i
was
never
tired
what
does
it
mean
to
give
greater
force
to
his
words
he
checked
himself
in
the
middle
of
a
yawn
and
began
to
hum
a
song
he
sang
it
with
a
pretended
manner
that
made
his
face
look
a
thousand
times
more
meagre
and
more
thoughtful
than
before
comes
just
then
tackleton
put
his
head
in
at
the
door
what
you
re
singing
are
you
he
thundered
go
it
i
can
t
sing
nobody
would
have
suspected
that
he
could
he
hadn
t
a
singing
face
by
any
means
i
can
t
afford
to
sing
said
tackleton
i
m
glad
you
can
i
hope
you
can
afford
to
work
too
hardly
time
for
both
i
should
caleb
turned
toward
his
daughter
and
said
in
a
low
tone
if
you
could
only
see
him
bertha
how
he
s
winking
at
me
such
a
man
to
joke
you
d
think
if
you
didn
t
know
him
he
was
in
earnest
wouldn
t
you
now
the
blind
girl
smiled
and
nodded
the
bird
that
can
sing
and
won
t
sing
must
be
made
to
sing
grumbled
tackleton
what
about
the
owl
that
can
t
sing
and
oughtn
t
to
sing
and
will
sing
is
there
anything
that
he
should
be
made
to
do
the
way
he
s
winking
at
me
this
moment
whispered
caleb
to
his
daughter
oh
my
gracious
always
merry
and
with
us
cried
the
smiling
bertha
oh
you
re
there
are
you
answered
tackleton
poor
idiot
he
really
did
believe
she
was
an
idiot
and
strange
to
say
he
thought
her
an
idiot
because
she
was
fond
of
him
well
being
there
how
are
you
said
tackleton
in
his
grudging
way
oh
well
quite
well
and
as
happy
as
even
you
could
wish
me
to
be
as
happy
as
you
would
make
the
whole
world
if
you
poor
idiot
muttered
tackleton
no
gleam
of
reason
not
a
gleam
the
blind
girl
took
his
hand
and
held
it
a
moment
in
her
own
two
hands
and
laid
her
cheek
against
it
tenderly
before
releasing
it
there
was
so
much
affectionate
gratitude
in
the
act
that
tackleton
himself
was
moved
to
say
in
a
milder
growl
than
usual
what
s
the
matter
now
i
stood
the
little
plant
beside
my
pillow
when
i
went
to
sleep
last
night
and
remembered
it
in
my
dreams
when
the
day
came
and
the
glorious
red
sun
the
red
sun
father
red
in
the
mornings
and
in
the
evenings
bertha
said
poor
caleb
with
a
woeful
glance
at
his
employer
when
it
rose
and
bright
light
came
into
the
room
i
turned
the
little
tree
towards
it
and
blessed
heaven
for
making
such
precious
things
and
blessed
you
for
sending
it
to
cheer
whew
said
tackleton
under
his
breath
we
re
getting
on
the
next
thing
will
be
the
padded
meanwhile
caleb
looked
as
if
he
were
uncertain
whether
tackleton
had
done
anything
deserving
of
praise
or
not
yet
he
knew
that
with
his
own
hands
he
had
brought
the
little
rose
tree
home
for
her
so
carefully
and
that
with
his
own
lips
he
had
made
her
believe
that
it
was
a
gift
from
tackleton
in
order
to
keep
her
from
suspecting
how
much
he
every
day
denied
himself
to
save
the
money
it
cost
that
she
might
be
the
happier
bertha
said
tackleton
with
for
once
a
show
of
cordiality
come
oh
i
can
come
straight
to
you
you
needn
t
guide
me
shall
i
tell
you
a
secret
bertha
if
you
will
she
answered
eagerly
how
bright
the
darkened
face
looked
how
anxious
the
listening
head
this
is
the
day
on
which
that
spoiled
child
john
peerybingle
s
wife
pays
her
regular
visit
to
you
makes
what
she
calls
her
picnic
here
ain
t
it
said
tackleton
with
a
look
of
distaste
for
the
affair
yes
replied
bertha
this
is
the
i
thought
so
said
tackleton
i
should
like
to
join
the
do
you
hear
that
father
cried
bertha
in
delight
yes
yes
i
heard
it
murmured
caleb
with
the
look
somewhat
of
a
sleepwalker
but
i
don
t
believe
you
see
said
tackleton
i
i
want
to
bring
the
peerybingles
a
little
more
into
the
company
of
may
fielding
for
i
am
going
to
be
married
to
married
cried
the
blind
girl
starting
from
him
oh
she
s
such
a
confounded
idiot
muttered
tackleton
that
i
was
afraid
she
d
never
comprehend
ah
yes
bertha
married
church
parson
clerk
bells
satin
veils
and
all
the
rest
of
the
tomfoolery
a
wedding
you
know
a
wedding
don
t
you
know
what
a
wedding
is
i
know
replied
the
blind
girl
gently
i
do
you
muttered
tackleton
it
s
more
than
i
then
aloud
well
on
that
account
i
want
to
join
the
party
and
bring
may
and
her
mother
i
ll
send
in
a
little
something
or
other
before
the
afternoon
a
cold
leg
of
mutton
or
some
comfortable
trifle
of
that
sort
you
ll
expect
me
yes
she
answered
turning
away
i
don
t
think
you
will
muttered
tackleton
looking
at
her
for
you
seem
to
have
forgotten
all
about
it
already
caleb
i
may
venture
to
say
i
m
here
i
suppose
thought
caleb
sir
take
care
she
don
t
forget
what
i
ve
been
saying
to
she
never
forgets
returned
caleb
it
s
one
of
the
few
things
she
ain
t
clever
every
man
thinks
his
geese
swans
observed
the
toy
merchant
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
poor
idiot
having
delivered
this
remark
with
much
contempt
old
gruff
and
tackleton
went
out
s
bertha
remained
where
he
had
left
her
lost
in
thought
the
gayety
had
vanished
from
her
face
and
it
was
very
sad
three
or
four
times
she
shook
her
head
as
if
bewailing
some
loss
it
was
not
until
caleb
had
been
busy
for
some
time
in
yoking
a
team
of
wooden
horses
to
the
tongue
of
a
little
wooden
wagon
by
the
simple
means
of
nails
driven
through
the
vital
parts
of
their
bodies
that
she
drew
near
his
and
sitting
down
beside
him
said
father
i
am
lonely
i
want
to
borrow
your
here
they
are
said
caleb
always
ready
they
are
more
yours
than
mine
bertha
any
hour
in
the
what
shall
your
eyes
do
for
you
dear
my
patient
willing
eyes
the
blind
girl
said
will
they
look
around
the
room
father
all
right
no
sooner
said
than
done
tell
me
about
it
s
much
the
same
as
usual
said
caleb
homely
but
snug
the
gay
colors
on
the
walls
the
bright
flowers
on
the
plates
and
other
dishes
the
shining
wood
where
there
are
no
panels
the
general
cheerfulness
and
neatness
of
the
building
all
make
it
very
cheerful
and
neat
it
was
wherever
bertha
s
hands
could
busy
themselves
but
nowhere
else
were
cheerfulness
and
neatness
possible
in
the
old
crazy
shed
which
caleb
s
fancy
painted
with
such
pleasant
description
you
have
your
working
clothes
on
and
are
not
so
gallant
as
when
you
wear
the
handsome
coat
said
bertha
touching
him
not
quite
so
gallant
answered
caleb
pretty
lively
father
said
the
blind
girl
drawing
close
to
his
side
and
putting
one
arm
around
his
neck
tell
me
something
about
may
is
she
very
pretty
she
is
indeed
said
caleb
and
she
was
indeed
it
was
quite
a
rare
thing
for
caleb
not
to
draw
upon
his
imagination
i
can
imagine
her
said
bertha
her
hair
is
dark
darker
than
mine
her
voice
is
sweet
and
musical
i
know
i
have
often
loved
to
hear
it
her
form
there
s
not
a
doll
in
all
the
room
can
compare
with
her
said
caleb
and
her
eyes
he
stopped
for
bertha
s
arm
around
his
neck
had
given
a
sudden
pressure
he
coughed
a
moment
hammered
a
moment
then
began
to
sing
the
gay
song
about
the
sparkling
bowl
a
thing
he
always
did
when
in
such
difficulties
now
about
your
friend
our
benefactor
tackleton
i
am
never
tired
you
know
of
hearing
about
him
now
was
i
ever
she
said
hastily
of
course
not
answered
caleb
and
with
ah
with
much
reason
cried
the
blind
girl
so
fervently
that
caleb
began
to
doubt
if
he
had
been
wise
in
deceiving
her
tell
me
about
him
dear
father
said
bertha
many
times
again
his
face
is
kind
and
tender
honest
and
true
i
am
sure
it
is
the
goodness
in
his
heart
shines
out
in
his
and
makes
it
noble
added
caleb
who
was
rather
desperate
by
now
and
makes
it
noble
cried
the
blind
girl
he
is
older
than
may
father
yes
quite
a
little
older
but
that
don
t
signify
said
caleb
oh
no
father
just
to
think
she
can
do
so
much
for
him
when
he
grows
old
and
infirm
and
can
nurse
him
if
he
gets
ill
and
help
him
in
every
way
will
she
do
all
this
father
no
doubt
of
it
said
caleb
i
love
her
for
that
father
i
love
her
with
all
my
heart
exclaimed
the
blind
girl
carrier
s
in
the
meantime
there
had
been
a
lively
scene
at
john
peerybingle
s
for
little
peerybingle
naturally
couldn
t
think
of
going
anywhere
without
the
baby
and
to
get
the
baby
ready
took
time
not
that
there
was
so
much
of
the
baby
but
there
was
so
much
to
do
about
it
and
it
all
had
to
be
done
by
easy
stages
for
instance
when
the
baby
was
got
by
hook
or
by
crook
to
a
certain
point
in
dressing
and
you
might
have
supposed
that
another
touch
or
two
would
finish
him
off
and
turn
him
out
a
tiptop
baby
he
was
unexpectedly
extinguished
in
a
warm
nightgown
and
hustled
off
to
bed
where
he
simmered
so
to
speak
between
sheets
and
blankets
for
the
best
part
of
an
hour
from
this
place
of
inaction
he
was
recalled
shining
very
much
and
roaring
violently
to
partake
of
his
luncheon
after
which
he
went
to
sleep
again
then
peerybingle
took
the
opportunity
to
make
herself
look
as
fine
as
possible
and
miss
slowboy
put
on
her
best
by
this
time
the
baby
being
all
alive
again
was
dressed
by
the
united
efforts
of
peerybingle
and
miss
slowboy
and
put
into
his
coat
and
flannel
cap
and
so
in
course
of
time
they
all
three
got
to
the
door
where
john
s
old
horse
stood
tearing
up
the
road
with
impatient
autographs
and
from
where
boxer
might
be
seen
a
little
distance
down
the
road
looking
back
tempting
the
horse
to
come
on
without
orders
if
you
think
that
peerybingle
needed
a
chair
or
anything
of
that
kind
to
help
her
climb
into
the
cart
you
are
mistaken
or
you
don
t
know
john
peerybingle
for
before
you
could
have
seen
him
he
lifted
her
from
the
ground
and
there
she
was
in
place
fresh
and
rosy
saying
oh
john
how
can
you
all
ready
asked
john
starting
off
after
miss
slowboy
and
the
baby
were
in
place
john
you
ve
got
the
basket
with
the
and
other
things
asked
dot
if
you
haven
t
you
must
turn
around
again
this
very
you
re
a
nice
little
article
replied
the
carrier
to
be
talking
about
turning
round
after
keeping
me
a
full
quarter
of
an
hour
behind
my
i
am
sorry
for
it
john
said
dot
but
i
really
could
not
think
of
going
to
bertha
s
i
would
not
do
it
john
on
any
account
without
the
and
things
whoa
this
last
word
was
addressed
to
the
horse
who
didn
t
mind
at
all
oh
do
turn
round
john
begged
peerybingle
please
it
ll
be
time
enough
to
do
that
said
john
when
i
begin
to
leave
things
behind
me
the
basket
s
here
safe
what
a
monster
you
must
be
john
not
to
have
said
so
at
once
and
saved
me
such
a
turn
i
declare
i
wouldn
t
go
to
bertha
s
without
the
and
things
for
any
money
regularly
once
a
fortnight
ever
since
we
have
been
married
we
have
had
our
little
picnic
if
anything
were
to
go
wrong
with
it
i
should
almost
think
we
were
never
to
be
lucky
it
was
a
kind
thought
in
the
first
place
said
the
carrier
and
i
honor
you
for
it
little
my
dear
john
replied
dot
turning
very
red
don
t
talk
about
honoring
me
good
gracious
observed
the
carrier
that
old
gentleman
dot
looked
embarrassed
he
s
an
odd
fish
said
the
carrier
i
can
t
make
him
out
i
don
t
believe
there
s
any
harm
in
him
none
at
all
i
m
i
m
sure
there
s
none
at
yes
said
the
carrier
with
his
eyes
attracted
to
her
face
because
she
had
spoken
so
earnestly
well
i
am
glad
you
feel
so
certain
about
it
because
it
makes
me
feel
surer
it
s
curious
he
should
have
taken
it
into
his
head
to
ask
us
for
lodgings
ain
t
it
things
come
about
so
so
very
strangely
she
rejoined
in
a
low
voice
scarcely
audible
however
he
s
a
old
gentleman
said
john
and
pays
as
a
gentleman
and
i
think
his
word
is
to
be
relied
upon
like
a
gentleman
s
i
had
quite
a
long
talk
with
him
this
morning
he
can
hear
me
better
already
he
says
as
he
gets
more
used
to
my
voice
he
told
me
a
great
deal
about
himself
and
i
told
him
a
good
deal
about
myself
and
a
rare
lot
of
questions
he
asked
me
i
told
him
about
having
two
routes
you
know
in
my
business
one
day
going
to
the
right
from
our
house
and
back
again
another
day
going
left
from
our
house
and
back
again
for
he
s
a
stranger
and
don
t
know
the
names
of
the
places
about
here
and
he
seemed
quite
pleased
why
he
says
then
i
shall
be
returning
your
way
i
thought
i
d
be
coming
in
exactly
the
opposite
direction
that
s
capital
i
may
trouble
you
for
another
lift
perhaps
but
i
ll
promise
not
to
fall
asleep
he
was
sound
asleep
surely
dot
what
are
you
thinking
of
thinking
of
john
i
i
was
listening
to
oh
that
s
all
right
said
the
carrier
i
was
afraid
from
the
look
of
your
face
that
i
had
gone
rambling
on
so
long
as
to
set
you
thinking
of
something
else
i
was
very
near
it
i
ll
be
dot
making
no
reply
they
jogged
on
for
some
time
in
silence
but
it
was
not
very
easy
to
remain
silent
long
in
john
peerybingle
s
cart
for
everybody
on
the
road
had
something
to
say
though
it
might
only
be
how
are
you
and
indeed
it
was
very
often
nothing
else
sometimes
passengers
on
foot
or
on
horseback
plodded
on
a
little
way
beside
the
cart
just
for
the
pleasure
of
having
a
chat
then
too
everybody
knew
boxer
all
along
the
road
especially
the
fowls
and
pigs
who
when
they
saw
him
coming
running
with
his
body
all
on
one
side
and
his
ears
pricked
up
inquisitively
would
make
tracks
and
not
wait
for
any
nearer
acquaintance
wherever
he
went
somebody
or
other
might
cry
hello
here
s
boxer
and
with
that
out
came
at
least
two
or
three
other
somebodies
to
bid
john
peerybingle
and
his
pretty
wife
the
packages
and
parcels
to
be
delivered
were
as
numerous
as
usual
and
it
required
many
stops
to
give
them
out
this
was
not
the
worst
part
of
the
journey
by
any
means
some
people
were
so
full
of
wonder
about
their
parcels
and
other
people
so
full
of
directions
about
the
parcels
they
were
sending
off
by
john
and
john
took
so
keen
an
interest
in
all
the
parcels
that
it
was
as
good
as
a
play
and
dot
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
as
she
looked
on
from
her
seat
in
the
cart
illustration
they
jogged
on
for
some
time
in
silence
the
trip
was
a
little
foggy
to
be
sure
in
the
january
weather
and
was
raw
and
cold
but
who
cared
for
such
trifles
not
dot
decidedly
not
tilly
slowboy
for
she
deemed
sitting
in
a
cart
on
any
terms
the
highest
point
of
human
joys
not
the
baby
i
ll
be
bound
for
it
s
not
in
baby
nature
to
be
warmer
or
more
sound
asleep
than
the
blessed
young
peerybingle
was
all
the
way
you
couldn
t
see
very
far
in
the
fog
of
course
but
you
could
see
a
great
deal
it
s
astonishing
how
much
you
may
see
in
a
thicker
fog
than
that
if
you
will
only
take
the
trouble
to
look
for
it
why
even
to
sit
looking
for
hazy
fairy
rings
and
ghostly
figures
near
the
hedges
and
trees
was
a
pleasant
occupation
to
make
no
mention
of
the
unexpected
shapes
in
which
the
trees
themselves
came
out
of
the
mists
and
glided
in
again
in
one
place
there
was
a
great
mound
of
weeds
burning
and
they
watched
the
fire
flaring
through
the
fog
with
here
and
there
a
dash
of
red
in
it
until
because
of
getting
smoke
up
her
nose
as
she
explained
miss
slowboy
choked
and
woke
the
baby
who
wouldn
t
go
to
sleep
again
but
boxer
who
was
in
advance
a
quarter
of
a
mile
or
so
had
passed
the
outskirts
of
the
town
and
gained
the
corner
of
the
street
where
caleb
and
his
daughter
lived
and
long
before
they
reached
the
door
he
and
the
blind
girl
were
on
the
pavement
waiting
to
receive
them
party
at
caleb
may
fielding
was
already
there
and
so
was
her
mother
a
little
querulous
chip
of
an
old
lady
with
a
peevish
face
gruff
and
tackleton
was
also
there
pretending
to
be
agreeable
and
perfectly
at
home
and
really
quite
as
much
out
of
his
element
as
a
fish
out
of
water
may
my
dear
old
friend
cried
dot
running
up
to
meet
her
what
happiness
to
see
you
her
old
friend
was
as
glad
as
she
and
it
really
was
if
you
ll
believe
me
a
pleasant
sight
to
see
them
embrace
each
other
tackleton
had
shown
taste
beyond
all
question
may
was
very
pretty
and
so
was
dot
pretty
they
simply
set
each
other
s
beauty
off
and
as
john
peerybingle
came
near
saying
they
ought
to
have
been
born
sisters
which
was
the
only
improvement
you
could
have
suggested
tackleton
had
brought
his
leg
of
mutton
and
wonderful
to
relate
a
tart
beside
but
he
could
afford
such
generosity
this
time
one
doesn
t
get
married
every
day
and
in
addition
to
these
dainties
there
were
the
and
things
as
peerybingle
called
them
which
were
chiefly
nuts
and
oranges
and
cakes
when
the
repast
was
set
forth
on
the
table
together
with
caleb
s
contribution
a
bowl
of
smoking
potatoes
which
was
all
he
was
allowed
to
provide
tackleton
led
his
future
to
the
post
of
honor
why
she
was
gotten
up
for
the
occasion
even
wearing
gloves
caleb
sat
next
his
daughter
dot
and
her
old
school
friend
were
side
by
side
the
carrier
took
care
of
the
bottom
of
the
table
miss
slowboy
was
seated
a
little
distance
away
far
from
every
other
article
of
furniture
but
the
chair
she
sat
on
that
she
might
have
nothing
to
knock
the
baby
s
head
against
she
was
delighted
not
only
to
take
care
of
the
baby
but
to
stare
around
at
the
toys
ah
may
said
dot
dear
dear
what
changes
to
talk
of
those
merry
school
days
makes
one
young
why
you
ain
t
particularly
old
at
any
time
are
you
said
tackleton
look
at
my
sober
plodding
husband
there
returned
dot
he
adds
twenty
years
to
my
age
at
least
don
t
you
john
forty
john
replied
how
many
add
to
may
s
i
am
sure
i
don
t
know
said
dot
laughing
but
she
can
t
be
much
less
than
a
hundred
years
of
age
on
her
next
ha
ha
laughed
tackleton
hollow
as
a
drum
was
the
laugh
though
and
he
looked
as
if
he
could
have
twisted
dot
s
neck
comfortably
dear
dear
said
dot
only
think
how
we
used
to
talk
sometimes
about
the
husbands
we
would
choose
i
don
t
know
how
lively
and
gay
mine
was
not
to
be
and
as
to
may
s
ah
dear
i
don
t
know
whether
to
laugh
or
cry
when
i
think
what
silly
girls
we
may
seemed
to
know
which
to
do
for
the
color
flashed
into
her
face
and
tears
stood
in
her
eyes
we
little
thought
how
things
would
come
about
said
dot
i
never
fixed
on
john
i
m
sure
i
never
so
much
as
thought
of
him
and
if
i
had
told
you
you
were
ever
to
be
married
to
tackleton
why
you
d
have
slapped
me
wouldn
t
you
may
though
may
didn
t
say
yes
she
certainly
didn
t
say
no
or
express
no
by
any
means
tackleton
laughed
quite
shouted
he
laughed
so
loud
john
peerybingle
laughed
too
in
his
ordinary
and
contented
manner
but
his
was
a
mere
whisper
of
a
laugh
compared
to
tackleton
s
you
couldn
t
help
yourselves
for
all
that
said
tackleton
you
couldn
t
resist
us
you
see
here
we
are
here
we
are
where
are
your
gay
young
bridegrooms
now
some
of
them
are
dead
said
dot
and
some
of
them
forgotten
some
of
them
if
they
could
stand
among
us
at
this
moment
would
not
believe
that
we
are
the
same
creatures
because
they
would
not
believe
we
forget
them
so
no
they
would
not
believe
one
word
of
it
why
dot
exclaimed
the
carrier
little
woman
and
dot
kept
quiet
while
tackleton
looked
at
her
through
his
eye
may
uttered
no
word
good
or
bad
but
sat
quite
still
with
her
eyes
downcast
and
made
no
sign
of
interest
in
what
had
passed
her
mother
however
observed
that
girls
were
girls
and
bygones
were
bygones
and
that
so
long
as
young
people
were
young
and
thoughtless
they
would
probably
conduct
themselves
like
young
and
thoughtless
persons
she
then
remarked
that
she
thanked
heaven
that
she
had
always
found
in
may
a
dutiful
and
obedient
child
for
which
she
took
no
credit
to
herself
though
she
had
every
reason
to
believe
it
was
owing
to
herself
with
regard
to
tackleton
she
said
that
he
was
a
to
be
desired
as
no
one
in
their
senses
could
doubt
now
the
meal
ended
john
peerybingle
rose
to
go
for
he
only
stopped
to
feed
his
horse
and
to
enjoy
the
social
hour
before
finishing
his
route
he
would
call
for
dot
on
his
way
back
this
was
always
the
program
on
picnic
days
he
said
pulling
on
his
dreadnought
coat
i
shall
be
back
at
the
usual
time
then
he
called
boxer
and
soon
the
old
horse
and
the
cart
were
making
lively
music
down
the
road
caleb
and
bertha
were
talking
together
at
one
end
of
the
room
so
bring
me
the
precious
baby
tilly
said
dot
drawing
a
chair
to
the
fire
and
while
i
have
him
in
my
lap
here
s
mrs
fielding
tilly
who
will
tell
me
all
about
the
management
of
babies
and
straighten
me
out
in
twenty
points
where
i
m
as
wrong
as
can
be
won
t
you
mrs
fielding
here
tackleton
walked
out
and
mrs
fielding
sitting
bolt
upright
in
front
of
dot
gave
her
such
a
marvelous
collection
of
receipts
and
rules
that
would
if
dot
had
carried
them
out
have
utterly
destroyed
the
young
peerybingle
even
if
he
had
been
an
infant
samson
now
dot
brought
her
needlework
out
of
her
pocket
and
had
a
whispering
chat
with
may
while
the
old
lady
dozed
and
after
a
while
caleb
and
bertha
joined
them
and
all
found
it
a
very
short
afternoon
then
as
it
grew
dark
since
it
was
the
solemn
rule
that
bertha
should
do
no
household
tasks
on
the
days
of
the
picnics
dot
trimmed
the
fire
and
swept
the
hearth
and
set
the
out
and
drew
the
curtains
and
lighted
a
candle
then
she
played
an
air
or
two
on
a
rude
kind
of
harp
which
caleb
had
made
for
bertha
and
played
them
very
well
for
nature
had
made
her
delicate
little
ear
as
choice
a
one
for
music
as
it
would
have
been
for
jewels
if
she
had
had
them
to
wear
by
this
time
it
was
the
usual
hour
for
tea
and
tackleton
came
back
again
to
share
the
meal
and
spend
the
evening
when
it
was
night
and
tea
was
over
and
dot
had
nothing
more
to
do
after
washing
the
cups
and
saucers
when
the
time
drew
near
for
the
carrier
s
return
dot
began
to
grow
nervous
every
time
she
heard
the
sound
of
distant
wheels
her
color
came
and
went
and
she
was
restless
not
as
good
wives
are
when
listening
for
their
husbands
no
no
no
it
was
a
different
sort
of
restlessness
from
that
soon
wheels
were
heard
very
near
horse
s
feet
the
barking
of
a
dog
and
then
the
scratching
of
boxer
s
paw
whose
step
is
that
cried
bertha
starting
up
whose
step
said
the
carrier
standing
in
the
door
his
brown
face
ruddy
as
a
winter
berry
from
the
keen
night
air
why
the
other
step
bertha
said
the
man
s
tread
behind
you
she
s
not
to
be
deceived
observed
the
carrier
laughing
come
along
sir
you
ll
be
welcome
never
fear
shadow
on
the
he
spoke
in
a
loud
tone
and
as
he
spoke
the
deaf
old
gentleman
entered
he
s
not
so
much
a
stranger
that
you
haven
t
seen
him
once
caleb
said
the
carrier
you
ll
give
him
till
we
go
oh
surely
john
and
take
it
as
an
he
s
the
best
company
on
earth
to
talk
secrets
in
said
john
i
have
reasonably
good
lungs
but
he
tried
them
i
ll
tell
turning
to
the
old
gentleman
he
spoke
in
a
loud
voice
again
sit
down
sir
all
friends
here
and
glad
to
see
then
he
added
in
his
natural
tone
a
chair
in
the
and
leave
to
sit
silent
and
look
pleasantly
about
him
is
all
he
cares
for
he
s
easily
bertha
had
been
listening
intently
she
called
caleb
to
her
side
and
when
he
came
asked
him
in
a
low
voice
to
describe
their
visitor
when
he
had
done
so
she
moved
away
and
showed
no
further
interest
in
him
the
carrier
was
in
high
spirits
good
fellow
that
he
was
and
fonder
of
his
little
wife
than
ever
some
folks
may
think
it
queer
he
said
jokingly
putting
his
rough
arm
about
her
as
she
stood
apart
from
the
others
but
i
like
this
little
lady
somehow
look
yonder
he
pointed
to
the
old
man
she
looked
down
i
think
she
trembled
he
s
ha
ha
ha
he
is
so
fond
of
you
that
he
talked
of
nothing
else
the
whole
way
here
i
like
him
for
i
wish
he
had
a
better
subject
john
she
said
with
an
uneasy
glance
about
the
room
at
tackleton
especially
a
better
subject
cried
the
jovial
john
there
s
no
such
thing
come
off
with
the
off
with
this
thick
shawl
off
with
the
heavy
wrappings
and
now
for
a
cozy
by
the
fire
how
would
it
please
you
mrs
fielding
to
have
a
game
of
cards
you
and
i
all
right
where
are
the
cards
dot
and
will
you
let
us
have
a
cup
of
tea
here
if
there
s
any
left
small
wife
soon
the
carrier
and
the
old
lady
were
deep
within
the
game
at
first
the
carrier
looked
about
him
sometimes
with
a
smile
or
now
and
then
called
dot
to
peep
over
his
shoulder
to
advise
him
on
some
knotty
point
but
soon
he
became
so
absorbed
that
he
had
neither
eyes
nor
ears
to
spare
and
his
whole
attention
was
upon
the
cards
and
he
thought
of
nothing
else
until
a
hand
was
laid
upon
his
shoulder
i
am
sorry
to
disturb
you
said
tackleton
in
a
low
voice
but
i
want
a
word
with
you
it
s
my
turn
to
deal
returned
the
carrier
can
you
wait
no
said
tackleton
come
on
there
was
an
expression
in
his
pale
face
which
made
john
rise
immediately
and
ask
him
in
a
hurry
what
the
matter
was
hush
john
peerybingle
said
tackleton
i
am
sorry
for
this
i
am
indeed
i
have
been
afraid
of
it
i
have
suspected
it
from
the
what
is
it
asked
the
carrier
in
alarm
hush
i
ll
show
you
if
you
ll
come
with
the
carrier
accompanied
him
without
another
word
they
went
across
the
yard
where
the
stars
were
shining
and
by
a
little
side
door
they
entered
tackleton
s
own
there
through
a
window
they
could
look
into
a
window
of
the
wareroom
where
the
boxes
of
toys
were
kept
the
was
closed
for
the
night
and
there
was
no
light
but
a
dim
light
was
burning
in
the
wareroom
so
they
could
easily
see
within
wait
a
moment
said
tackleton
can
you
bear
to
look
through
that
window
do
you
think
why
not
asked
the
carrier
it
will
be
a
shock
said
tackleton
promise
not
to
do
anything
and
then
john
looked
and
what
do
you
think
he
saw
he
saw
his
dear
young
wife
with
the
old
man
old
no
longer
but
straight
and
handsome
holding
in
his
hands
his
soft
white
hair
with
which
he
had
made
every
one
think
him
old
and
treat
him
so
kindly
he
saw
her
listening
to
him
as
he
bent
his
head
to
whisper
in
her
ear
and
then
let
him
place
his
arm
about
her
waist
and
lead
her
slowly
to
the
door
he
saw
her
with
her
own
hands
adjust
the
wig
on
his
head
laughing
as
she
did
so
john
felt
weak
as
an
infant
as
tackleton
led
him
back
to
the
house
he
was
wrapped
up
to
the
chin
and
busy
with
his
horse
and
parcels
when
she
came
into
the
room
ready
for
going
home
now
john
dear
may
bertha
she
said
how
could
she
kiss
them
how
be
so
blithe
and
gay
in
her
parting
why
didn
t
she
blush
tackleton
as
well
as
john
wondered
tilly
was
hushing
the
baby
and
as
she
walked
to
and
fro
she
was
repeating
drowsily
did
they
thought
that
it
was
to
be
its
wives
wring
its
heart
almost
to
breaking
and
did
it
weep
all
nights
when
nobody
was
there
to
see
it
now
tilly
give
me
the
baby
said
little
peerybingle
tackleton
where
s
john
for
goodness
sake
he
s
going
to
walk
beside
the
horse
s
head
said
tackleton
who
helped
her
into
the
cart
my
dear
john
walk
the
muffled
figure
of
her
husband
made
a
hasty
sign
and
the
stranger
and
nurse
being
by
this
time
in
their
places
the
old
horse
moved
off
boxer
running
on
before
running
back
running
round
and
round
the
cart
and
barking
merrily
when
tackleton
had
gone
off
likewise
taking
may
and
her
mother
poor
caleb
sat
down
by
the
fire
beside
his
daughter
the
toys
that
had
been
wound
and
set
in
motion
for
the
baby
had
run
down
long
ago
in
the
silence
one
might
have
imagined
that
they
had
been
stricken
motionless
with
wonder
at
dot
being
false
or
tackleton
beloved
under
any
set
of
circumstances
presently
bertha
spoke
after
tackleton
is
married
we
shall
not
see
so
much
of
him
shall
we
father
well
we
might
that
is
to
say
began
caleb
how
i
should
love
to
be
like
may
father
and
have
my
eyes
so
that
i
might
serve
him
might
show
my
love
for
him
who
has
been
so
good
so
kind
so
poor
caleb
how
often
he
said
to
himself
as
he
looked
at
her
in
remorse
have
i
deceived
her
from
her
cradle
thinking
to
make
her
happier
but
to
break
her
heart
at
last
xxxvi
chirp
the
third
listens
to
the
the
dutch
clock
in
the
corner
struck
ten
when
the
carrier
sat
down
at
his
fireside
so
troubled
was
he
that
he
scarcely
heard
the
cuckoo
as
it
counted
off
the
strokes
he
could
scarcely
believe
what
his
eyes
had
seen
in
the
wareroom
of
gruff
and
tackleton
if
any
one
had
told
him
he
would
not
have
believed
his
dot
could
be
a
party
to
such
dreadful
deceit
yet
in
his
own
heart
he
did
not
blame
her
but
rather
the
old
young
man
who
had
been
so
wickedly
unfair
and
he
was
planning
to
do
him
harm
to
pay
him
back
he
hoped
that
dot
would
be
able
to
explain
but
no
there
really
wasn
t
any
hope
of
that
there
she
was
coming
she
had
been
upstairs
with
the
baby
putting
it
to
bed
as
he
sat
brooding
near
the
hearth
she
came
close
to
him
and
put
her
little
stool
at
his
feet
he
then
felt
her
hand
upon
his
own
and
knew
she
was
looking
up
in
his
face
he
glanced
at
her
she
looked
as
sweet
as
ever
until
she
caught
the
expression
on
his
face
at
first
she
seemed
surprised
then
her
surprise
changed
in
a
wild
recognition
of
his
thoughts
and
she
simply
bent
her
head
and
clasped
her
hands
but
no
words
were
said
at
length
she
rose
and
went
away
and
he
felt
glad
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
known
her
to
have
her
gone
there
was
a
gun
hanging
on
the
wall
he
took
it
down
and
moved
toward
the
stranger
s
room
he
put
his
hand
to
the
door
when
suddenly
the
struggling
fire
burst
into
a
glow
of
light
and
the
cricket
on
the
hearth
began
to
chirp
no
sound
he
could
have
heard
no
human
voice
not
even
hers
could
so
have
moved
and
softened
him
the
very
words
in
which
she
had
told
him
of
her
love
for
this
same
cricket
were
as
if
just
spoken
in
her
sweet
pleasant
voice
making
household
music
and
they
thrilled
through
and
through
his
better
nature
and
awoke
it
into
life
and
action
he
moved
from
the
door
like
a
man
who
had
been
walking
in
his
sleep
when
awakening
from
a
frightful
dream
he
put
the
gun
aside
clasping
his
hands
before
his
face
he
sat
down
again
beside
the
fire
the
cricket
on
the
hearth
came
out
into
the
room
and
stood
in
fairy
shape
before
him
i
love
it
said
the
fairy
voice
for
the
many
times
i
have
heard
it
and
the
many
thoughts
its
harmless
music
has
given
me
she
said
so
cried
the
carrier
true
this
has
been
a
happy
home
john
and
i
love
the
cricket
for
its
she
s
so
so
cheerful
busy
otherwise
i
never
could
have
loved
her
as
i
the
voice
correcting
him
said
you
should
trust
her
the
fairy
voice
said
all
night
long
he
listened
to
the
voice
all
night
long
the
household
fairies
were
busy
with
him
showing
him
how
sweet
and
dear
she
was
how
he
had
never
found
her
untrue
or
had
reason
to
doubt
her
except
this
once
he
rose
up
when
it
was
broad
day
and
washed
and
tidied
himself
he
could
not
go
on
his
usual
rounds
for
it
was
tackleton
s
wedding
day
he
had
planned
to
go
merrily
to
the
church
with
dot
but
such
plans
were
at
an
end
ah
what
a
different
wedding
anniversary
he
had
expected
blames
the
carrier
had
thought
that
tackleton
would
pay
him
an
early
visit
and
he
was
right
he
had
just
finished
brushing
his
hair
when
he
saw
the
merchant
in
his
carriage
coming
along
the
road
as
the
carriage
drew
near
he
saw
that
tackleton
was
dressed
out
sprucely
for
marriage
and
that
he
had
decorated
his
horse
s
head
with
flowers
and
favors
the
horse
looked
much
more
like
a
bridegroom
than
tackleton
whose
eye
was
more
disagreeably
expressive
than
ever
but
the
carrier
took
little
heed
of
this
his
thoughts
were
elsewhere
john
peerybingle
said
tackleton
my
good
fellow
how
do
you
find
yourself
this
morning
i
have
had
but
a
poor
night
tackleton
said
the
carrier
shaking
his
head
for
i
have
been
a
good
deal
disturbed
in
my
mind
but
it
s
over
now
can
you
spare
me
half
an
hour
or
so
for
some
private
talk
i
came
on
purpose
returned
tackleton
lightly
never
mind
the
horse
he
ll
stand
quiet
enough
if
you
ll
give
him
a
mouthful
of
you
are
not
to
be
married
before
noon
i
think
said
john
no
answered
tackleton
plenty
of
time
plenty
of
when
they
entered
the
kitchen
tilly
slowboy
was
knocking
at
the
stranger
s
door
one
of
her
very
red
eyes
was
at
the
keyhole
for
she
had
been
crying
because
her
mistress
cried
she
was
knocking
very
loud
and
seemed
frightened
if
you
please
i
can
t
make
nobody
hear
said
tilly
looking
round
i
hope
nobody
ain
t
gone
and
been
and
died
if
you
this
hope
miss
slowboy
made
more
emphatic
by
kicking
on
the
door
but
it
led
to
no
result
shall
i
help
asked
tackleton
turning
to
john
the
carrier
nodded
his
head
so
tackleton
went
to
the
door
and
he
too
kicked
and
knocked
and
he
too
failed
to
get
any
reply
but
he
thought
of
trying
the
handle
of
the
door
and
as
it
opened
easily
he
peeped
in
went
in
and
soon
came
running
out
again
he
s
gone
said
tackleton
and
the
window
s
open
i
don
t
see
any
marks
to
be
sure
or
signs
of
a
fight
but
i
thought
perhaps
you
might
have
been
so
angry
he
nearly
shut
up
the
expressive
eye
altogether
he
looked
at
john
so
hard
and
he
gave
his
eye
and
his
face
and
his
whole
body
a
sharp
twist
as
if
he
would
have
screwed
the
truth
out
of
john
make
yourself
easy
said
the
carrier
he
went
into
that
room
last
night
without
harm
in
word
or
act
from
me
and
no
one
has
entered
it
since
he
has
gone
away
of
his
own
free
oh
well
i
think
he
has
got
off
pretty
easy
said
tackleton
taking
a
chair
the
sneer
was
lost
upon
the
carrier
who
sat
down
too
and
shaded
his
face
in
his
hand
for
some
time
before
speaking
you
showed
me
last
night
he
said
at
length
my
wife
my
dear
wife
that
i
love
deceiving
me
and
meeting
a
strange
man
who
had
deceived
me
i
think
there
s
no
man
in
the
world
i
wouldn
t
rather
have
had
show
it
to
i
confess
i
know
that
i
am
not
a
favorite
in
your
home
john
because
i
never
believed
wholly
in
your
pretty
little
wife
said
tackleton
and
as
you
did
show
me
and
as
you
saw
her
to
such
disadvantage
it
is
right
you
should
know
what
my
mind
is
on
the
subject
for
it
s
settled
and
nothing
can
change
tackleton
muttered
a
few
words
about
its
being
necessary
to
decide
but
he
was
overawed
by
the
manner
of
his
companion
plain
and
unpolished
as
it
was
there
was
something
noble
and
dignified
about
it
i
am
a
plain
rough
man
continued
the
carrier
with
very
little
to
recommend
me
i
am
not
a
clever
man
as
you
very
well
know
i
am
not
a
young
man
i
loved
my
little
dot
because
i
had
seen
her
grow
up
from
a
child
in
her
father
s
house
because
i
knew
how
precious
she
was
because
she
had
been
in
my
life
for
years
and
he
paused
a
moment
then
went
on
i
often
thought
that
though
i
wasn
t
good
enough
for
her
i
should
make
her
a
kind
husband
and
perhaps
appreciate
her
better
than
another
and
so
it
came
about
we
were
hah
said
tackleton
with
a
shake
of
his
head
i
knew
how
much
i
loved
her
and
how
happy
i
should
be
continued
the
carrier
but
i
had
not
sufficiently
considered
no
said
tackleton
no
you
didn
t
stop
to
think
how
giddy
frivolous
fickle
vain
hah
you
d
better
not
interrupt
me
said
the
carrier
with
some
sternness
till
you
understand
me
which
you
seem
far
from
the
toy
merchant
looked
at
him
in
surprise
i
didn
t
consider
that
i
took
her
at
her
age
with
her
beauty
away
from
her
young
companions
and
their
many
scenes
of
pleasure
into
my
dull
house
and
my
tedious
society
i
didn
t
consider
how
little
suited
i
was
to
her
fun
and
humor
and
how
wearisome
i
must
be
to
one
of
her
quick
spirit
no
i
took
advantage
of
her
hopeful
nature
and
i
married
her
i
shouldn
t
have
done
so
the
toy
merchant
gazed
at
him
without
winking
even
the
eye
was
now
open
heaven
bless
her
said
the
carrier
for
the
cheerful
way
she
has
tried
not
to
let
me
see
how
it
was
heaven
help
me
that
in
my
slow
mind
i
have
not
found
it
out
before
poor
child
poor
dot
strange
i
did
not
realize
when
i
have
seen
her
eyes
fill
with
tears
on
hearing
of
such
a
marriage
as
our
own
spoken
of
how
good
and
kind
she
has
been
the
thought
will
comfort
me
when
i
am
here
here
alone
said
tackleton
then
you
do
mean
to
take
some
notice
of
her
deceit
i
mean
answered
the
carrier
to
do
her
the
greatest
kindness
in
my
power
to
try
to
make
it
all
up
to
her
she
shall
be
free
to
go
where
she
make
it
up
to
her
exclaimed
tackleton
twisting
and
turning
his
great
ears
with
his
hands
i
must
have
heard
wrong
you
didn
t
say
that
of
didn
t
i
speak
plainly
said
the
carrier
giving
the
toy
merchant
a
shake
very
plainly
indeed
answered
tackleton
as
if
i
meant
it
very
much
as
if
you
meant
anger
and
distrust
have
left
me
said
the
carrier
and
nothing
but
my
grief
remains
in
an
unhappy
moment
some
old
lover
better
suited
to
her
years
than
i
returned
last
night
she
saw
him
in
the
interview
we
witnessed
it
was
wrong
but
otherwise
than
this
she
is
innocent
if
there
is
truth
on
earth
i
should
not
have
taken
her
from
her
home
she
shall
return
to
it
and
i
will
trouble
her
no
more
her
father
and
mother
will
be
here
and
they
shall
take
her
home
this
is
the
end
of
what
you
showed
me
now
it
s
oh
no
john
not
over
do
not
say
it
s
over
yet
not
quite
yet
i
heard
your
noble
words
i
could
not
steal
out
again
letting
you
think
me
ignorant
of
what
you
said
do
not
say
it
s
over
till
the
clock
has
struck
again
dot
had
entered
quietly
while
john
and
tackleton
were
talking
and
had
heard
every
word
no
hand
can
make
the
clock
which
will
strike
again
for
me
the
hours
that
are
gone
replied
the
carrier
with
a
faint
smile
but
let
it
be
so
if
you
will
my
well
muttered
tackleton
i
must
be
off
for
when
it
strikes
again
i
must
be
on
my
way
to
church
john
the
carrier
saw
him
to
the
door
watched
his
horse
until
it
disappeared
in
the
distance
and
then
went
out
himself
his
little
wife
being
left
alone
sobbed
piteously
but
often
dried
her
tears
to
say
how
good
and
dear
he
was
and
once
or
twice
she
laughed
through
her
tears
so
heartily
and
triumphantly
that
tilly
was
quite
horrified
ow
if
you
please
don
t
said
tilly
it
s
enough
to
dead
and
bury
the
baby
so
it
is
if
you
will
you
bring
him
to
see
me
sometimes
inquired
her
mistress
when
i
don
t
live
here
and
have
gone
to
my
old
home
ow
if
you
please
don
t
cried
tilly
throwing
back
her
head
she
looked
a
great
deal
like
boxer
when
he
howled
ow
if
you
please
don
t
what
has
everybody
gone
and
been
and
done
with
everybody
making
everybody
so
miserable
confesses
his
and
she
might
have
kept
on
if
just
at
that
moment
caleb
plummer
had
not
come
in
leading
his
daughter
why
mary
which
was
dot
s
other
name
you
remember
why
mary
said
bertha
not
at
the
wedding
i
told
her
you
would
not
be
there
mum
whispered
caleb
i
heard
as
much
last
night
but
bless
you
said
the
little
man
i
don
t
care
what
they
say
i
don
t
believe
them
there
ain
t
much
of
me
but
what
little
there
is
would
be
torn
to
pieces
sooner
than
i
d
believe
a
word
against
you
he
put
his
arms
around
her
neck
and
hugged
her
very
much
as
a
child
might
have
hugged
one
of
the
dolls
he
had
made
bertha
wanted
to
come
see
you
instead
of
going
to
the
wedding
said
caleb
so
we
started
in
good
time
i
often
wish
i
had
not
deceived
her
in
regard
to
tackleton
and
i
ve
come
to
the
conclusion
that
i
d
better
tell
her
the
truth
you
ll
stay
with
us
while
i
tell
her
won
t
you
mum
he
inquired
trembling
from
head
to
foot
i
don
t
know
what
effect
it
may
have
upon
her
i
don
t
know
what
she
ll
think
of
me
i
don
t
know
that
she
ll
ever
care
for
her
father
afterwards
but
it
s
best
she
should
be
undeceived
and
i
must
bear
the
consequences
as
i
mary
said
bertha
where
is
your
hand
i
heard
them
speaking
softly
last
night
of
some
blame
against
you
they
were
wrong
i
told
them
so
i
scorned
to
hear
a
word
i
know
and
trust
you
mary
so
well
that
could
my
sight
be
restored
at
this
instant
i
could
choose
you
from
a
crowd
my
sister
her
father
went
on
one
side
of
her
while
dot
remained
on
the
other
holding
her
hand
bertha
my
dear
said
caleb
i
have
something
on
my
mind
i
want
to
tell
you
while
we
three
are
alone
listen
kindly
i
have
a
confession
to
make
to
a
confession
father
yes
my
child
i
have
wandered
from
the
truth
said
caleb
with
a
pitiable
expression
in
his
face
i
have
wandered
from
the
truth
intending
to
be
kind
to
you
and
have
been
she
turned
toward
him
and
repeated
the
word
cruel
he
accuses
himself
too
strongly
bertha
said
dot
you
ll
say
so
presently
you
ll
be
the
first
to
tell
him
he
cruel
to
me
cried
bertha
with
an
unbelieving
smile
not
meaning
to
be
my
child
said
caleb
but
i
have
been
although
i
never
knew
it
until
yesterday
my
dear
blind
daughter
forgive
me
the
world
dear
heart
is
not
as
you
imagine
it
it
is
not
as
i
have
represented
it
the
eyes
you
have
trusted
in
have
been
false
to
she
turned
her
wondering
face
toward
him
still
but
drew
back
and
clung
closer
to
her
friend
your
road
in
life
was
rough
my
poor
one
said
caleb
and
i
meant
to
smooth
it
for
you
i
have
pictured
things
to
you
as
different
from
what
they
are
i
have
even
changed
the
characters
of
some
people
to
make
you
happier
i
have
surrounded
you
with
but
living
people
are
not
fancies
she
said
turning
very
pale
you
can
t
change
i
have
done
so
bertha
caleb
told
her
there
is
one
person
you
know
oh
father
why
do
you
say
i
know
she
said
i
who
am
so
miserably
she
stretched
out
her
hands
as
if
to
feel
her
way
the
marriage
that
takes
place
caleb
continued
is
with
a
stern
sordid
grinding
man
he
has
been
a
hard
master
to
you
and
me
my
dear
for
many
years
ugly
in
his
looks
and
in
his
nature
cold
and
callous
always
unlike
what
i
have
painted
him
to
you
in
everything
my
child
in
oh
why
cried
the
blind
girl
why
did
you
ever
do
this
teach
me
to
love
a
person
who
really
never
existed
it
is
like
death
her
poor
father
hung
his
head
and
offered
no
reply
in
his
penitence
and
sorrow
suddenly
the
cricket
on
the
hearth
unheard
by
all
but
her
began
to
chirp
not
merrily
but
so
mournfully
that
her
tears
began
to
flow
and
when
the
fairy
spirit
which
had
been
near
the
carrier
all
night
appeared
behind
her
pointing
toward
her
father
she
turned
to
dot
mary
she
said
tell
me
what
my
home
is
like
what
it
is
it
is
a
poor
place
bertha
very
poor
and
bare
indeed
the
house
will
scarcely
keep
out
the
wind
and
rain
another
winter
it
is
as
roughly
shielded
from
the
weather
bertha
dot
continued
in
a
low
voice
as
your
poor
father
in
his
sackcloth
the
blind
girl
greatly
agitated
rose
and
led
the
carrier
s
wife
a
little
aside
those
presents
that
i
treasured
so
much
that
came
almost
at
my
wish
she
said
trembling
where
did
they
come
from
did
you
send
them
who
then
dot
saw
she
knew
already
and
was
silent
the
blind
girl
spread
her
hands
before
her
face
again
but
in
quite
a
different
manner
now
dear
mary
a
moment
please
speak
softly
tell
me
truly
look
across
the
room
to
where
we
were
sitting
just
now
to
where
my
father
is
my
father
so
kind
and
loving
to
me
and
tell
me
what
you
i
see
said
dot
who
understood
her
well
an
old
man
sitting
in
a
chair
and
leaning
over
sorrowfully
with
his
head
resting
in
his
hands
he
looks
as
if
his
child
should
comfort
him
yes
yes
she
will
go
he
is
an
old
man
worn
with
care
and
work
he
is
a
sad
thoughtful
man
who
seems
to
have
lost
the
object
he
most
loved
in
the
world
his
child
for
whom
he
the
blind
girl
broke
away
from
her
and
dropping
on
her
knees
before
him
threw
her
arms
around
his
neck
oh
my
father
my
dear
dear
father
she
cried
i
have
been
so
blind
but
now
my
eyes
are
open
i
never
knew
you
to
think
i
might
have
died
and
never
truly
known
the
father
who
has
been
so
loving
to
me
caleb
managed
to
say
my
bertha
and
in
my
blindness
i
believed
him
to
be
so
different
said
the
girl
still
caressing
him
so
young
and
gay
the
fresh
smart
father
in
the
blue
coat
said
poor
caleb
he
s
gone
nothing
is
gone
she
answered
dearest
father
no
everything
is
here
in
you
but
father
she
hesitated
mary
mary
is
just
what
you
told
me
there
is
no
change
in
her
you
never
told
me
anything
of
her
that
was
not
true
i
should
have
done
so
i
m
afraid
said
caleb
if
i
could
have
made
her
better
than
she
was
but
i
must
have
changed
her
for
the
worse
if
i
had
changed
at
all
nothing
could
improve
her
the
blind
girl
was
delighted
with
this
reply
even
though
she
had
felt
so
sure
of
what
it
must
be
and
her
renewed
embrace
of
dot
was
charming
to
behold
dead
returns
to
dot
glanced
at
the
clock
and
saw
that
it
was
within
a
few
minutes
of
striking
and
immediately
became
very
excited
more
changes
than
you
think
for
may
happen
though
said
dot
changes
for
the
better
i
mean
changes
for
great
joy
to
some
of
us
you
mustn
t
let
them
startle
you
too
much
when
they
come
but
listen
you
ve
a
quick
ear
bertha
do
you
hear
wheels
upon
the
road
yes
coming
very
i
i
i
know
you
have
a
quick
ear
said
dot
holding
her
hand
to
her
heart
and
talking
as
fast
as
she
could
because
i
have
often
noticed
it
and
because
you
were
so
quick
to
hear
that
strange
step
last
night
though
why
you
should
have
taken
such
quick
notice
of
it
and
said
whose
step
is
that
seems
strange
but
as
i
said
just
now
there
are
great
changes
in
this
world
great
changes
and
we
can
t
do
better
than
prepare
ourselves
to
be
surprised
at
hardly
caleb
wondered
what
she
meant
for
he
saw
that
she
was
speaking
to
him
as
much
as
to
his
daughter
he
saw
with
astonishment
that
she
was
fluttered
and
distressed
and
could
scarcely
breathe
as
she
held
to
a
chair
to
save
herself
from
falling
they
are
wheels
indeed
she
panted
coming
nearer
nearer
very
close
and
now
you
hear
them
stopping
at
the
garden
gate
and
now
you
hear
a
step
outside
the
door
the
same
step
bertha
is
it
not
and
now
she
uttered
a
cry
of
delight
and
running
up
to
caleb
put
her
hands
over
his
eyes
as
a
young
man
rushed
into
the
room
and
flinging
his
hat
into
the
air
came
sweeping
down
upon
them
is
it
over
cried
dot
yes
happily
over
yes
do
you
know
the
voice
dear
caleb
did
you
ever
hear
one
like
it
before
cried
dot
if
my
boy
who
went
to
south
america
had
not
died
if
he
were
alive
said
caleb
trembling
he
is
alive
shrieked
dot
taking
her
hands
from
his
eyes
and
clapping
them
in
ecstasy
look
at
him
see
here
he
stands
before
you
healthy
and
strong
your
own
dear
son
your
own
dear
living
brother
bertha
she
turned
to
meet
the
sunburned
sailor
half
way
and
let
him
kiss
her
heartily
just
at
this
moment
the
carrier
entered
upon
seeing
them
thus
he
started
back
look
john
cried
caleb
look
here
my
own
son
him
that
you
fitted
out
and
sent
away
yourself
him
you
were
always
such
a
friend
to
the
carrier
advanced
to
seize
him
by
the
hand
but
stepped
back
as
he
noticed
his
resemblance
to
the
deaf
man
in
the
cart
edward
was
it
you
now
tell
him
all
cried
dot
tell
him
all
edward
and
don
t
spare
i
was
the
man
said
edward
and
you
stole
disguised
into
the
home
of
your
old
friend
the
carrier
said
i
would
never
have
believed
it
of
you
there
was
a
true
and
frank
boy
once
how
many
years
is
it
caleb
since
we
heard
that
he
was
dead
and
had
it
proved
we
thought
he
would
never
have
done
that
there
was
a
generous
friend
of
mine
once
a
friend
who
was
more
a
father
than
a
friend
he
never
would
have
judged
a
man
before
he
heard
his
case
you
were
he
so
i
am
certain
you
will
hear
me
the
carrier
with
a
troubled
glance
at
dot
replied
well
that
s
but
fair
i
you
must
know
then
that
when
i
left
here
a
boy
i
was
in
love
and
my
love
was
returned
but
the
girl
was
very
young
and
couldn
t
quite
make
up
her
mind
still
i
felt
quite
certain
that
she
loved
me
as
dearly
as
i
loved
you
did
exclaimed
the
carrier
yes
and
now
i
am
sure
she
did
so
all
through
the
hardships
and
perils
of
my
years
away
i
was
constantly
thinking
of
when
i
should
come
back
to
her
when
i
landed
twenty
miles
from
here
i
heard
she
had
bestowed
herself
upon
another
and
a
richer
man
i
did
not
wish
to
find
fault
with
her
if
she
had
preferred
him
what
i
wanted
to
find
out
was
whether
she
had
done
this
of
her
own
free
will
i
wanted
to
judge
for
myself
just
how
she
felt
so
i
disguised
myself
you
know
how
and
waited
on
the
road
you
know
where
you
had
no
suspicion
of
me
neither
had
she
pointing
to
dot
until
i
whispered
in
her
ear
at
the
fireside
and
so
startled
her
that
she
nearly
betrayed
oh
dot
exclaimed
the
carrier
but
when
she
knew
that
edward
was
alive
and
had
come
back
sobbed
dot
now
speaking
for
herself
as
she
had
long
wished
to
do
and
when
he
told
her
why
he
had
disguised
himself
she
advised
him
to
keep
his
secret
close
by
all
means
for
she
knew
that
his
old
friend
john
peerybingle
was
too
open
in
his
nature
to
keep
such
a
secret
no
matter
how
he
tried
then
she
that
s
me
john
told
him
all
how
his
sweetheart
had
thought
him
dead
and
how
she
had
after
all
the
years
been
by
her
mother
because
the
silly
dear
old
thing
called
the
marriage
advantageous
and
when
she
that
s
me
john
told
him
they
were
not
yet
married
but
soon
would
be
and
that
it
would
be
nothing
but
a
sacrifice
if
it
went
on
for
there
was
no
love
on
her
side
and
when
he
went
nearly
wild
with
joy
to
hear
it
when
she
that
s
me
again
john
said
she
would
help
him
and
carry
messages
to
his
sweetheart
as
she
had
so
often
done
as
a
girl
and
she
would
find
out
what
his
sweetheart
thought
was
right
oh
said
john
and
it
was
right
john
dot
continued
catching
her
breath
for
they
were
married
john
an
hour
ago
and
here
s
the
bride
and
gruff
and
tackleton
may
die
a
bachelor
and
i
m
a
happy
little
woman
may
god
bless
you
as
she
drew
may
forward
and
lavished
all
kinds
of
good
wishes
and
congratulations
upon
her
the
carrier
stood
confounded
as
he
flew
towards
her
dot
stretched
out
her
hand
to
stop
him
john
dear
john
forgive
me
it
was
wrong
to
have
a
secret
from
you
i
m
very
sorry
i
didn
t
think
it
any
harm
until
the
night
when
i
came
and
sat
down
by
you
on
the
little
stool
but
when
i
looked
at
your
face
i
knew
you
must
have
seen
me
walking
in
the
wareroom
with
edward
and
were
suspicious
of
me
but
oh
john
how
could
how
could
you
think
wrong
of
me
john
peerybingle
would
have
caught
her
in
his
arms
but
no
she
wouldn
t
let
him
wait
a
minute
please
john
dear
until
you
let
me
hear
you
tell
me
that
you
believe
me
and
trust
me
and
that
you
know
how
much
i
love
you
so
much
that
i
ll
never
have
another
secret
from
you
and
that
you
ll
never
never
think
of
sending
me
from
my
home
and
yours
john
and
our
cricket
on
the
then
you
would
have
been
delighted
to
see
dot
run
into
the
carrier
s
arms
you
may
be
sure
the
carrier
was
in
a
state
of
perfect
rapture
and
you
may
be
sure
that
everybody
especially
miss
slowboy
wept
for
joy
and
she
wishing
to
include
the
baby
handed
him
around
to
everyone
in
succession
as
if
he
were
something
to
eat
or
drink
but
now
the
sound
of
wheels
was
heard
again
outside
the
door
and
somebody
exclaimed
that
gruff
and
tackleton
was
coming
back
in
soon
he
appeared
looking
warm
and
flustered
my
what
in
nation
s
this
john
peerybingle
said
tackleton
there
s
some
mistake
i
had
an
appointment
with
miss
fielding
to
meet
me
at
the
church
and
oh
here
she
is
seeing
her
with
edward
to
whom
he
then
turned
saying
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
i
haven
t
the
pleasure
of
knowing
you
but
if
you
can
do
me
the
favor
to
spare
this
young
lady
she
has
a
rather
particular
engagement
with
me
this
but
i
can
t
spare
her
said
edward
i
couldn
t
think
of
what
do
you
mean
you
vagabond
exclaimed
tackleton
i
mean
and
i
pardon
you
for
being
vexed
i
mean
that
i
am
as
deaf
to
your
harsh
words
as
i
was
last
such
a
startled
look
as
tackleton
gave
him
it
is
too
bad
sir
said
edward
holding
out
may
s
left
hand
especially
the
third
finger
that
the
young
lady
can
t
accompany
you
to
the
church
but
as
she
has
been
there
once
this
morning
perhaps
you
ll
excuse
tackleton
looked
hard
at
the
third
finger
and
took
a
ring
out
of
his
waistcoat
pocket
miss
slowboy
said
tackleton
will
you
have
the
kindness
to
throw
that
into
the
fire
thank
it
was
a
previous
engagement
quite
an
old
engagement
that
prevented
my
wife
from
keeping
her
appointment
with
you
i
assure
you
said
edward
mr
tackleton
will
do
me
the
justice
to
say
that
i
told
him
about
this
old
engagement
many
times
and
that
i
never
could
forget
it
said
may
blushing
oh
certainly
said
tackleton
oh
to
be
sure
oh
it
s
all
right
it
s
quite
correct
you
are
now
edward
plummer
i
infer
that
s
the
name
said
the
bridegroom
ah
i
shouldn
t
have
known
you
said
tackleton
i
give
you
joy
with
these
words
he
hurried
away
merely
stopping
at
the
gate
to
take
the
flowers
and
favors
off
the
horse
s
head
and
to
kick
the
horse
once
just
to
relieve
his
feelings
of
course
the
next
thing
in
order
was
the
wedding
feast
and
dot
set
to
work
with
all
her
might
even
calling
in
some
neighborly
help
and
everybody
as
if
on
the
point
of
life
or
death
ran
against
each
other
in
all
the
doorways
and
round
all
the
corners
tumbling
over
tilly
slowboy
and
the
baby
everywhere
then
there
was
an
expedition
to
find
mrs
fielding
and
to
apologize
to
her
and
to
bring
her
back
happy
and
forgiving
at
first
she
would
not
listen
at
all
and
wouldn
t
say
anything
but
now
carry
me
to
my
grave
which
seemed
absurd
on
account
of
her
not
being
dead
or
even
after
a
while
she
settled
down
into
a
dreadful
calm
and
advantage
was
taken
of
this
to
get
her
into
her
coat
and
gloves
and
carry
her
off
to
john
peerybingle
s
when
they
reached
the
house
there
were
dot
s
father
and
mother
and
may
s
mother
and
dot
s
mother
began
to
renew
their
acquaintance
after
a
grand
confusion
of
talk
and
action
they
actually
were
seated
at
the
table
to
have
missed
that
dinner
would
have
been
to
have
missed
as
good
and
as
jolly
a
meal
as
man
need
eat
after
dinner
caleb
sang
his
song
about
the
sparkling
bowl
and
you
may
not
believe
it
but
he
sang
it
through
and
a
most
unexpected
thing
occurred
just
as
he
finished
the
last
verse
does
the
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
and
a
man
came
staggering
in
with
a
big
round
box
which
he
set
on
the
table
in
the
center
of
the
nuts
and
apples
he
said
mr
tackleton
s
compliments
and
as
he
hasn
t
got
no
use
for
the
cake
himself
perhaps
you
ll
eat
and
with
these
words
he
walked
off
there
was
some
surprise
among
the
company
as
you
may
imagine
mrs
fielding
suggested
that
the
cake
might
be
poisoned
and
told
about
a
cake
which
she
had
heard
of
that
had
turned
a
seminary
of
young
ladies
blue
but
notwithstanding
the
story
the
cake
was
cut
by
may
with
much
ceremony
and
rejoicing
i
don
t
think
any
one
had
tasted
it
when
there
came
another
tap
at
the
door
and
the
same
man
appeared
again
having
under
his
arm
a
big
brown
paper
parcel
mr
tackleton
s
compliments
and
he
s
sent
a
few
toys
for
the
baby
they
ain
t
the
whole
party
would
not
have
been
able
to
find
words
to
express
their
astonishment
even
if
they
had
had
plenty
of
time
but
they
had
none
for
the
messenger
had
scarcely
shut
the
door
when
there
came
another
tap
and
tackleton
himself
walked
in
mrs
peerybingle
said
the
toy
merchant
hat
in
hand
i
m
sorry
i
m
sour
by
disposition
but
i
am
going
to
try
to
do
better
caleb
i
might
have
had
you
and
your
daughter
for
dear
friends
as
it
is
my
house
is
lonely
i
have
not
even
a
cricket
on
the
hearth
i
have
scared
them
all
away
be
kind
to
me
please
let
me
join
this
happy
party
he
was
at
home
in
five
minutes
you
never
saw
such
a
fellow
had
he
been
doing
with
himself
all
his
life
never
to
have
known
before
how
much
fun
he
had
in
him
or
what
had
the
fairies
been
doing
with
him
to
change
him
so
there
was
but
one
more
living
creature
wanted
to
make
the
party
complete
and
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
there
he
was
very
thirsty
with
hard
running
for
boxer
had
gone
all
the
way
with
the
cart
on
its
journey
and
being
disgusted
at
finding
his
master
absent
and
unable
to
induce
the
horse
to
come
with
him
had
turned
tail
and
trotted
home
there
was
a
dance
in
the
evening
but
since
the
old
people
didn
t
dance
and
dot
said
her
dancing
days
were
over
because
i
believe
she
preferred
to
sit
near
the
carrier
really
edward
and
may
were
the
only
dancers
and
they
got
up
amid
great
applause
to
dance
alone
while
bertha
played
her
liveliest
tune
well
if
you
ll
believe
me
they
had
not
been
dancing
five
minutes
when
the
carrier
suddenly
jumps
up
takes
dot
round
the
waist
dashes
out
into
the
room
and
starts
off
with
her
toe
and
heel
quite
wonderfully
tackleton
no
sooner
sees
this
than
he
skims
across
to
mrs
fielding
and
follows
suit
then
dot
s
father
and
mother
and
caleb
and
tilly
slowboy
join
in
hark
how
the
cricket
joins
the
music
with
its
chirp
chirp
chirp
and
how
the
kettle
hums
the
return
home
mary

the
return
home
xxxvii
mary
frances
come
again
in
the
middle
of
the
story
the
cricket
on
the
hearth
when
everybody
was
so
anxious
to
hear
more
there
came
the
sound
of
many
voices
and
then
a
loud
scream
mary
frances
knew
it
was
the
voice
of
the
old
witch
who
had
been
listening
let
me
be
she
was
crying
i

then

the
deep
heavy
voice
of

giant

screamed
the
old
witch
quick
did
may
fielding
marry
tackleton
did
she
did
she
and
mary
frances
heard
her
screaming
did
she
did
she
until
her
voice
died
away
how
mary
frances
longed
to
tell
her
no
but
she
did
not
dare
she
deserves
her
punishment
the
queen
whispered
and
since
she
knew
that
that
was
true
mary
frances
did
not
speak
after
the
story
was
over
she
received
her
copy
from
the
ready
writer
and
slipped
it
into
her
story
satchel
with
the
rest
of
the
stories
then
she
wandered
down
by
the
seashore
alone
near
the
shore
there
was
a
boy
with
a
feather
in
his
cap
sitting
on
a
rock
she
knew
him
in
a
minute
where
did
the
giant
take
the
old
witch
do
you
think
peter
pan
she
asked
to
the
devil
s
den
said
peter
i
saw
them
to
the
devil
s
den
cried
mary
frances
how
dreadful
it
s
not
such
a
bad
place
said
peter
it
is
just
a
deep
cave
it
is
lighted
from
a
large
opening
in
the
top
its
name
is
the
worst
thing
about
it
but
the
old
witch
can
not
get
out
of
it
if
they
lock
her
oh
she
got
away
from
the
giant
s
basket
then
she
did
she
was
so
crazy
to
hear
a
story
through
that
she
watched
her
first
chance
to
make
off
when
the
giant
guard
was
what
about
the
pirate
asked
mary
frances
he
is
chained
to
a
rock
in
the
pirate
s
cove
and
he
spends
his
time
jumping
in
and
out
of
the
water
he
has
jumped
so
much
and
so
hard
that
the
suds
are
rising
all
around
him
just
as
when
you
blow
bubbles
in
a
bowl
holding
the
pipe
down
in
the
water
poor
thing
some
day
the
suds
will
rise
so
high
that
the
bubbles
will
cover
him
and
smother
is
there
no
way
for
him
to
save
himself
asked
mary
frances
certainly
said
peter
pan
all
he
has
to
do
is
to
be
good
but
he
won
t
be
he
s
just
naturally
wicked
he
d
murder
fairies
if
he
could
and
he
d
steal
all
the
stories
in
the
world
and
he
d
feed
children
on
charcoal
and
castor
oil
he
told
me
so
once
it
was
after
i
caught
him
trying
to
steal
my
he
must
have
a
wicked
heart
said
mary
frances
once
i
asked
him
why
he
was
so
bad
peter
told
her
and
what
do
you
think
he
said
i
don
t
know
i
m
sure
she
returned
he
said
it
was
because
his
mother
never
kissed
his
mother
never
kissed
him
exclaimed
mary
frances
why
what
a
queer
kind
of
mother
now
my
mother
suddenly
she
felt
very
homesick
tears
sprang
to
her
eyes
why
peter
she
cried
wistfully
why
peter
it
must
be
over
a
year
since
my
mother
kissed
me

i
turn
wicked
too
oh
i
wish
i
could
see
her
my
own
dear
mother
as
she
finished
speaking
a
beautiful
little
appeared
before
them
it
was
smaller
than

good
ferry

aboard

peter

and
leading
her
toward
the
boat

away
and
thank

she
watched
until
the
island
was
too
far
away
for
her
to
make
out
the
forms
of
the
people
at
the
castle
windows
then
she
wished
aloud
home
take
me
to
my
mother
and
father
and
my
brother
little
fairy
and
the
wind
blew
and
filled
the
sails
and
the
sun
warmed
and
cheered
her
and
the
waves
danced
about
the
boat
making
little
lapping
sounds
which
were
like
music
and
the
next
thing
she
knew
she
was
running
up
the
garden
walk
into
her
mother

open
arms
