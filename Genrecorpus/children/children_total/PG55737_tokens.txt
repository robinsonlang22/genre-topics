the
weaving
of
the
magic
cloak
the
fairies
assembled
one
moonlit
night
in
a
pretty
clearing
of
the
ancient
forest
of
burzee
the
clearing
was
in
the
form
of
a
circle
and
all
around
stood
giant
oak
and
fir
trees
while
in
the
center
the
grass
grew
green
and
soft
as
velvet
if
any
mortal
had
ever
penetrated
so
far
into
the
great
forest
and
could
have
looked
upon
the
fairy
circle
by
daylight
he
might
perhaps
have
seen
a
tiny
path
worn
in
the
grass
by
the
feet
of
the
dancing
elves
for
here
during
the
full
of
the
moon
the
famous
fairy
band
ruled
by
good
queen
lulea
loved
to
dance
and
make
merry
while
the
silvery
rays
flooded
the
clearing
and
caused
their
gauzy
wings
to
sparkle
with
every
color
of
the
rainbow
on
this
especial
night
however
they
were
not
dancing
for
the
queen
had
seated
herself
upon
a
little
green
mound
and
while
her
band
clustered
about
her
she
began
to
address
the
fairies
in
a
tone
of
discontent
i
am
tired
of
dancing
my
dears
said
she
every
evening
since
the
moon
grew
big
and
round
we
have
come
here
to
frisk
about
and
laugh
and
disport
ourselves
and
although
those
are
good
things
to
keep
the
heart
light
one
may
grow
weary
even
of
merrymaking
so
i
ask
you
to
suggest
some
new
way
to
divert
both
me
and
yourselves
during
this
that
is
a
hard
task
answered
one
pretty
sprite
opening
and
folding
her
wings
a
lady
toys
with
her
fan
we
have
lived
through
so
many
ages
that
we
long
ago
exhausted
everything
that
might
be
considered
a
novelty
and
of
all
our
recreations
nothing
gives
us
such
continued
pleasure
as
but
i
do
not
care
to
dance
replied
lulea
with
a
little
frown
we
might
create
something
by
virtue
of
our
fairy
powers
suggested
one
who
reclined
at
the
feet
of
the
queen
ah
that
is
just
the
idea
exclaimed
the
dainty
lulea
with
brightening
countenance
let
us
create
something
but
what
i
have
heard
remarked
another
member
of
the
band
of
a
having
been
made
by
some
fairies
in
america
and
whatever
mortal
wore
this
was
able
to
conceive
the
most
noble
and
beautiful
that
was
indeed
a
worthy
creation
cried
the
little
queen
what
became
of
the
cap
the
man
who
received
it
was
so
afraid
some
one
else
would
get
it
and
be
able
to
think
the
same
exquisite
thoughts
as
himself
that
he
hid
it
safely
safely
that
he
himself
never
could
think
afterward
where
he
had
placed
how
unfortunate
but
we
must
not
make
another
lest
it
meet
a
like
fate
can
not
you
suggest
something
else
i
have
heard
said
another
of
certain
fairies
who
created
a
pair
of
enchanted
boots
which
would
always
carry
their
mortal
wearer
away
from
never
into
what
a
great
boon
to
those
blundering
mortals
cried
the
queen
and
whatever
became
of
the
boots
they
came
at
last
into
the
possession
of
a
great
general
who
did
not
know
their
powers
so
he
wore
them
into
battle
one
day
and
immediately
ran
away
followed
by
all
his
men
and
the
fight
was
won
by
the
but
did
not
the
general
escape
danger
the
expense
of
his
reputation
so
he
retired
to
a
farm
and
wore
out
the
boots
tramping
up
and
down
a
country
road
and
trying
to
decide
why
he
had
suddenly
become
such
a
the
boots
were
worn
by
the
wrong
man
surely
said
the
queen
and
that
is
why
they
proved
a
curse
rather
than
a
blessing
but
we
want
no
enchanted
boots
think
of
something
suppose
we
weave
a
magic
cloak
proposed
espa
a
sweet
little
fairy
who
had
not
before
spoken
a
cloak
indeed
we
might
easily
weave
that
returned
the
queen
but
what
sort
of
magic
powers
must
it
possess
let
its
wearer
have
any
wish
instantly
fulfilled
said
espa
brightly
illustration
suppose
we
weave
a
magic
but
at
this
there
arose
quite
a
murmur
of
protest
on
all
sides
which
the
queen
immediately
silenced
with
a
wave
of
her
royal
hand
our
sister
did
not
think
of
the
probable
consequences
of
what
she
suggested
declared
lulea
smiling
into
the
downcast
face
of
little
espa
who
seemed
to
feel
rebuked
by
the
disapproval
of
the
others
an
instant
s
reflection
would
enable
her
to
see
that
such
power
would
give
the
cloak
s
mortal
wearer
as
many
privileges
as
we
ourselves
possess
and
i
suppose
you
intended
the
magic
cloak
for
a
mortal
wearer
she
inquired
yes
answered
espa
shyly
that
was
my
but
the
idea
is
good
nevertheless
continued
the
queen
and
i
propose
we
devote
this
evening
to
weaving
the
magic
cloak
only
its
magic
shall
give
to
its
wearer
the
fulfilment
of
but
one
wish
and
i
am
quite
sure
that
even
that
should
prove
a
great
boon
to
the
helpless
suppose
more
than
one
person
wears
the
cloak
one
of
the
band
said
which
then
shall
have
the
one
wish
fulfilled
the
queen
devoted
a
moment
to
thought
and
then
replied
each
possessor
of
the
magic
cloak
may
have
one
wish
granted
provided
the
cloak
is
not
stolen
from
its
last
wearer
in
that
case
the
magic
power
will
not
be
exercised
on
behalf
of
the
but
should
there
not
be
a
limit
to
the
number
of
the
cloak
s
wearers
asked
the
fairy
lying
at
the
queen
s
feet
i
think
not
if
used
properly
our
gift
will
prove
of
great
value
to
mortals
and
if
we
find
it
is
misused
we
can
at
any
time
take
back
the
cloak
and
revoke
its
magic
power
so
now
if
we
are
all
agreed
upon
this
novel
amusement
let
us
set
to
at
these
words
the
fairies
sprang
up
eagerly
and
their
queen
smiling
upon
them
waved
her
wand
toward
the
center
of
the
clearing
at
once
a
beautiful
fairy
loom
appeared
in
the
space
it
was
not
such
a
loom
as
mortals
use
it
consisted
of
a
large
and
a
small
ring
of
gold
supported
by
a
tall
pole
of
jasper
the
entire
band
danced
around
it
thrice
the
fairies
carrying
in
each
hand
a
silver
shuttle
wound
with
glossy
filaments
finer
than
the
finest
silk
and
the
threads
on
each
shuttle
appeared
a
different
hue
from
those
of
all
the
other
shuttles
at
a
sign
from
the
queen
they
one
and
all
approached
the
golden
loom
and
fastened
an
end
of
thread
in
its
warp
next
moment
they
were
gleefully
dancing
hither
and
thither
while
the
silver
shuttles
flew
swiftly
from
hand
to
hand
and
the
web
began
to
grow
upon
the
loom
presently
the
queen
herself
took
part
in
the
sport
and
the
thread
she
wove
into
the
fabric
was
the
magical
one
which
was
destined
to
give
the
cloak
its
wondrous
power
long
and
swiftly
the
fairy
band
worked
beneath
the
old
moon
s
rays
while
their
feet
tripped
gracefully
over
the
grass
and
their
joyous
laughter
tinkled
like
silver
bells
and
awoke
the
echoes
of
the
grim
forest
surrounding
them
and
at
last
they
paused
and
threw
themselves
upon
the
green
with
little
sighs
of
content
for
the
shuttles
and
loom
had
vanished
the
work
was
complete
and
queen
lulea
stood
upon
the
mound
holding
in
her
hand
the
magic
cloak
the
garment
was
as
beautiful
as
it
was
and
every
hue
of
the
rainbow
glinted
and
sparkled
from
the
soft
folds
and
while
it
was
light
in
weight
as
swan
its
strength
was
so
great
that
the
fabric
was
indestructible
the
fairy
band
regarded
it
with
great
satisfaction
for
every
one
had
assisted
in
its
manufacture
and
could
admire
with
pardonable
pride
its
glossy
folds
it
is
very
lovely
indeed
cried
little
espa
but
to
whom
shall
we
present
it
the
question
aroused
a
dozen
suggestions
each
fairy
seeming
to
favor
a
different
mortal
every
member
of
this
band
as
you
doubtless
know
was
the
unseen
guardian
of
some
man
or
woman
or
child
in
the
great
world
beyond
the
forest
and
it
was
but
natural
that
each
should
wish
her
own
ward
have
the
magic
cloak
while
they
thus
disputed
another
fairy
joined
them
and
pressed
to
the
side
of
the
queen
welcome
ereol
said
lulea
you
are
the
was
very
lovely
in
appearance
and
with
her
fluffy
golden
hair
and
clear
blue
eyes
was
marvelously
fair
to
look
upon
in
a
low
grave
voice
she
answered
the
queen
yes
your
majesty
i
am
late
but
i
could
not
help
it
the
old
king
of
noland
whose
guardian
i
have
been
since
his
birth
has
passed
away
this
evening
and
i
could
not
bear
to
leave
him
until
the
end
so
the
old
king
is
dead
at
last
said
the
queen
thoughtfully
he
was
a
good
man
but
woefully
uninteresting
and
he
must
have
wearied
you
greatly
at
times
my
sweet
illustration
yes
your
majesty
i
am
all
mortals
are
i
think
wearisome
returned
the
fairy
with
a
sigh
and
who
is
the
new
king
of
noland
asked
lulea
there
is
none
answered
ereol
the
old
king
died
without
a
single
relative
to
succeed
to
his
throne
and
his
five
high
counselors
were
in
a
great
dilemma
when
i
came
well
my
dear
you
may
rest
and
enjoy
yourself
for
a
period
in
order
to
regain
your
old
lightsome
spirits
by
and
by
i
will
appoint
you
guardian
to
some
newly
born
babe
that
your
duties
may
be
less
arduous
but
i
am
sorry
you
were
not
with
us
for
we
have
had
rare
sport
see
we
have
woven
a
magic
ereol
examined
the
garment
with
pleasure
and
who
is
to
wear
it
she
asked
then
again
arose
the
dispute
as
to
which
mortal
in
all
the
world
should
possess
the
magic
cloak
finally
the
queen
laughing
at
the
arguments
of
her
band
said
to
them
come
let
us
leave
the
decision
to
the
man
in
the
moon
he
has
been
watching
us
with
a
great
deal
of
amusement
and
once
i
am
sure
i
caught
him
winking
at
us
in
quite
a
roguish
at
this
every
head
was
turned
toward
the
moon
and
then
a
man
s
face
and
wrinkled
but
with
a
jolly
look
upon
the
rough
features
appeared
sharply
defined
upon
the
moon
s
broad
surface
so
i
m
to
decide
another
dispute
eh
said
he
in
a
clear
voice
well
my
dears
what
is
it
this
time
we
wish
you
to
say
what
mortal
shall
wear
the
magic
cloak
which
i
and
the
ladies
of
my
court
have
woven
replied
queen
lulea
give
it
to
the
first
unhappy
person
you
meet
said
the
man
in
the
moon
the
happy
mortals
have
no
need
of
magic
and
with
this
advice
the
friendly
face
of
the
man
in
the
moon
faded
away
until
only
the
outlines
remained
visible
against
the
silver
disk
the
queen
clapped
her
hands
delightedly
illustration
give
it
to
the
first
unhappy
person
you
our
man
in
the
moon
is
very
wise
she
declared
and
we
shall
follow
his
suggestion
go
ereol
since
you
are
free
for
a
time
and
carry
the
magic
cloak
to
noland
and
the
first
person
you
meet
who
is
really
unhappy
be
it
man
woman
or
child
shall
receive
from
you
the
cloak
as
a
gift
from
our
fairy
ereol
bowed
and
folded
the
cloak
over
her
arm
come
my
children
continued
lulea
the
moon
is
hiding
behind
the
and
it
is
time
for
us
to
illustration
said
the
man
in
the
a
moment
later
the
fairies
had
disappeared
and
the
clearing
wherein
they
had
danced
and
woven
the
magic
cloak
lay
shrouded
in
deepest
gloom

jikki
chapter
ii
the
book
of
laws
on
this
same
night
great
confusion
and
excitement
prevailed
among
the
five
high
counselors
of
the
kingdom
of
noland
the
old
king
was
dead
and
there
was
none
to
succeed
him
as
ruler
of
the
country
he
had
outlived
every
one
of
his
relatives
and
since
the
crown
had
been
in
this
one
family
for
generations
it
puzzled
the
high
counselors
to
decide
upon
a
fitting
successor
these
five
high
counselors
were
very
important
men
it
was
said
that
they
ruled
the
kingdom
while
the
king
ruled
them
which
made
it
quite
easy
for
the
king
and
rather
difficult
for
the
people
the
chief
counselor
was
named
tullydub
he
was
old
and
very
pompous
and
had
a
great
respect
for
the
laws
of
the
land
the
next
in
rank
was
tollydob
the
lord
high
general
of
the
king
s
army
the
third
was
tillydib
the
lord
high
the
fourth
was
tallydab
the
lord
high
steward
and
the
fifth
and
last
of
the
high
counselors
was
tellydeb
the
lord
high
executioner
these
five
had
been
careful
not
to
tell
the
people
when
the
old
king
had
become
ill
for
they
feared
being
annoyed
by
many
foolish
questions
they
sat
in
a
big
room
next
the
of
the
king
in
the
royal
palace
of
nole
is
the
capital
city
of
noland
kept
every
one
out
except
the
king
s
physician
who
was
half
blind
and
wholly
dumb
and
could
not
gossip
with
outsiders
had
he
wanted
to
and
while
the
high
counselors
sat
and
waited
for
the
king
to
recover
or
die
as
he
might
choose
jikki
waited
upon
them
and
brought
them
their
meals
jikki
was
the
king
s
valet
and
principal
servant
he
was
as
old
as
any
of
the
five
high
counselors
but
they
were
all
fat
whereas
jikki
was
wonderfully
lean
and
thin
and
the
counselors
were
solemn
and
dignified
whereas
jikki
was
terribly
nervous
and
very
talkative
beg
pardon
my
masters
he
would
say
every
five
minutes
but
do
you
think
his
majesty
will
get
well
and
then
before
any
of
the
high
counselors
could
collect
themselves
to
answer
he
continued
beg
pardon
but
do
you
think
his
majesty
will
die
and
the
next
moment
he
would
say
beg
pardon
but
do
you
think
his
majesty
is
any
better
or
any
worse
and
all
this
was
so
annoying
to
the
high
counselors
that
several
times
one
of
them
took
up
some
object
in
the
room
with
the
intention
of
hurling
it
at
jikki
s
head
but
before
he
could
throw
it
the
old
servant
had
nervously
turned
away
and
left
the
room
tellydeb
the
lord
high
executioner
would
often
sigh
i
wish
there
were
some
law
that
would
permit
me
to
chop
off
jikki
s
but
then
tullydub
the
chief
counselor
would
say
gloomily
there
is
no
law
but
the
king
s
will
and
he
insists
that
jikki
be
allowed
to
so
they
were
forced
to
bear
with
jikki
as
best
they
could
but
after
the
king
breathed
his
last
breath
the
old
servant
became
more
nervous
and
annoying
than
ever
hearing
that
the
king
was
dead
jikki
made
a
rush
for
the
door
of
the
but
tripped
over
the
foot
of
tollydob
and
fell
upon
the
marble
floor
so
violently
that
his
bones
rattled
and
he
picked
himself
up
half
dazed
by
the
fall
where
are
you
going
asked
tollydob
to
toll
the
bell
for
the
king
s
death
answered
jikki
illustration
where
are
you
going
asked
well
remain
here
until
we
give
you
permission
to
go
commanded
the
lord
high
general
but
the
bell
ought
to
be
tolled
said
jikki
be
silent
growled
the
lord
high
we
know
what
ought
to
be
done
and
what
ought
not
to
be
but
this
was
not
strictly
true
in
fact
the
five
high
counselors
did
not
know
what
ought
to
be
done
under
these
strange
circumstances
if
they
told
the
people
the
king
was
dead
and
did
not
immediately
appoint
his
successor
then
the
whole
population
would
lose
faith
in
them
and
fall
to
fighting
and
quarreling
among
themselves
as
to
who
should
become
king
and
that
would
never
in
the
world
do
no
it
was
evident
that
a
new
king
must
be
chosen
before
they
told
the
people
that
the
old
king
was
dead
but
whom
should
they
choose
for
the
new
king
that
was
the
important
question
while
they
talked
of
these
matters
the
jikki
kept
rushing
in
and
saying
hadn
t
i
better
toll
the
bell
no
they
would
shout
in
a
chorus
and
then
jikki
would
rush
out
again
so
they
sat
and
thought
and
counseled
together
during
the
whole
long
night
and
by
morning
they
were
no
nearer
a
solution
of
the
problem
than
before
at
daybreak
jikki
stuck
his
head
into
the
room
and
said
hadn
t
i
no
they
all
shouted
in
a
breath
very
well
returned
jikki
i
was
only
going
to
ask
if
i
hadn
t
better
get
you
some
yes
they
cried
again
in
one
breath
and
shall
i
toll
the
bell
no
they
screamed
and
the
lord
high
steward
threw
an
inkstand
that
hit
the
door
several
seconds
after
jikki
had
closed
it
and
disappeared
while
they
were
at
breakfast
they
again
discussed
their
future
action
in
the
choice
of
a
king
and
finally
the
chief
counselor
had
a
thought
that
caused
him
to
start
so
suddenly
that
he
nearly
choked
the
book
he
gasped
staring
at
his
brother
counselors
in
a
rather
wild
manner
what
book
asked
the
lord
high
general
the
book
of
laws
answered
the
chief
counselor
i
never
knew
there
was
such
a
thing
remarked
the
lord
high
executioner
looking
puzzled
i
always
thought
the
king
s
will
was
the
so
it
was
so
it
was
when
we
had
a
king
answered
tullydub
excitedly
but
this
book
of
laws
was
written
years
ago
and
was
meant
to
be
used
when
the
king
was
absent
or
ill
or
illustration
no
they
all
shouted
in
a
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
have
you
ever
read
the
book
then
asked
tillydib
no
but
i
will
fetch
it
at
once
and
we
shall
see
if
there
is
not
a
law
to
help
us
out
of
our
so
the
chief
counselor
brought
the
huge
old
volume
that
had
a
musty
smell
to
it
and
was
locked
together
with
a
silver
padlock
then
the
key
had
to
be
found
which
was
no
easy
task
but
finally
the
great
book
of
laws
lay
open
upon
the
table
and
all
the
five
periwigs
of
the
five
fat
counselors
were
bent
over
it
at
once
long
and
earnestly
they
searched
the
pages
but
it
was
not
until
after
noon
that
tullydub
suddenly
placed
his
broad
thumb
upon
a
passage
and
shouted
i
have
it
i
have
it
what
is
it
read
it
read
it
aloud
cried
the
others
illustration
so
the
chief
counselor
brought
the
illustration
suddenly
placing
his
broad
thumb
on
a
passage
he
shouted
i
have
it
i
have
it
just
then
jikki
rushed
into
the
room
and
asked
shall
i
toll
the
bell
no
they
yelled
glaring
at
him
so
jikki
ran
out
shaking
his
head
dolefully
then
tullydub
adjusted
his
spectacles
and
leaned
over
the
book
reading
aloud
the
following
words
in
case
the
king
dies
and
there
is
no
one
to
succeed
him
the
chief
counselor
of
the
kingdom
shall
go
at
sunrise
to
the
eastward
gate
of
the
city
of
nole
and
count
the
persons
who
enter
through
such
gate
as
soon
as
it
is
opened
by
the
guards
and
the
person
that
so
enters
be
it
man
woman
or
child
rich
or
poor
humble
or
noble
shall
immediately
be
proclaimed
king
or
queen
as
the
case
may
be
and
shall
rule
all
the
kingdom
of
noland
forever
after
so
long
as
he
or
she
may
live
and
if
any
one
in
all
the
kingdom
of
nole
shall
refuse
to
obey
the
slightest
wish
of
the
new
ruler
such
person
shall
at
once
be
put
to
death
this
is
the
then
all
the
five
high
counselors
heaved
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
and
repeated
together
the
words
this
is
the
but
it
s
a
strange
law
nevertheless
remarked
the
lord
high
i
wish
i
knew
who
will
be
the
person
to
enter
the
east
gate
at
we
must
wait
and
see
answered
the
lord
high
general
and
i
will
have
my
army
assembled
and
marshaled
at
the
gateway
that
the
new
ruler
of
noland
may
be
welcomed
in
a
truly
kingly
manner
as
well
as
to
keep
the
people
in
order
when
they
hear
the
strange
beg
pardon
exclaimed
jikki
looking
in
at
the
doorway
but
shall
i
toll
the
bell
no
you
numskull
retorted
tullydub
angrily
if
the
bell
is
tolled
the
people
will
be
told
and
they
must
not
know
that
the
old
king
is
dead
until
the
person
enters
the
east
gateway
morning
chapter
iii
the
gift
of
the
magic
cloak
nearly
two
days
journey
from
the
city
of
nole
yet
still
within
the
borders
of
the
great
kingdom
of
noland
was
a
little
village
lying
at
the
edge
of
a
broad
river
it
consisted
of
a
cluster
of
houses
of
the
humblest
description
for
the
people
of
this
village
were
all
poor
and
lived
in
simple
fashion
yet
one
house
appeared
to
be
somewhat
better
than
the
others
for
it
stood
on
the
and
had
been
built
by
the
ferryman
whose
business
it
was
to
carry
all
travelers
across
the
river
and
as
many
traveled
that
way
the
ferryman
was
able
in
time
to
erect
a
very
comfortable
cottage
and
to
buy
good
furniture
for
it
and
to
clothe
warmly
and
neatly
his
two
children
one
of
these
children
was
a
little
girl
named
margaret
who
was
called
meg
by
the
villagers
and
fluff
by
the
ferryman
her
father
because
her
hair
was
so
soft
and
fluffy
her
brother
who
was
two
years
younger
was
named
timothy
but
margaret
had
always
called
him
bud
because
she
could
not
say
brother
more
plainly
when
first
she
began
to
talk
so
nearly
every
one
who
knew
timothy
called
him
bud
as
little
meg
did
these
children
had
lost
their
mother
when
very
young
and
the
big
ferryman
had
tried
to
be
both
mother
and
father
to
them
and
had
reared
them
very
gently
and
lovingly
they
were
good
children
and
were
liked
by
every
one
in
the
village
but
one
day
a
terrible
misfortune
befell
them
the
ferryman
tried
to
cross
the
river
for
a
passenger
one
very
stormy
night
but
he
never
reached
the
other
shore
when
the
storm
subsided
and
morning
came
they
found
his
body
lying
on
the
and
the
two
children
were
left
alone
in
the
world
the
news
was
carried
by
travelers
to
the
city
of
nole
where
the
ferryman
s
only
sister
lived
and
a
few
days
afterward
the
woman
came
to
the
village
and
took
charge
of
her
orphaned
niece
and
nephew
she
was
not
a
woman
this
aunt
rivette
but
she
had
worked
hard
all
her
life
and
had
a
stern
face
and
a
stern
voice
she
thought
the
only
way
to
make
children
behave
was
to
box
their
ears
every
now
and
then
so
poor
meg
who
had
been
at
her
dear
father
s
loss
had
still
more
occasion
for
tears
after
aunt
rivette
came
to
the
village
as
for
bud
he
was
so
impudent
and
to
the
old
lady
that
she
felt
obliged
to
switch
him
and
afterward
the
boy
became
surly
and
silent
and
neither
wept
nor
answered
his
aunt
a
single
word
it
hurt
margaret
dreadfully
to
see
her
little
brother
whipped
and
she
soon
became
so
unhappy
at
the
sorrowful
circumstances
in
which
she
and
her
brother
found
themselves
that
she
sobbed
from
morning
till
night
and
knew
no
comfort
aunt
rivette
who
was
a
laundress
in
the
city
of
nole
decided
she
would
take
meg
and
bud
back
home
with
her
the
boy
can
carry
water
for
my
tubs
and
the
girl
can
help
me
with
the
ironing
she
said
so
she
sold
all
the
heavier
articles
of
furniture
that
the
cottage
contained
as
well
as
the
cottage
itself
and
all
the
remainder
of
her
dead
brother
s
belongings
she
loaded
upon
the
back
of
the
little
donkey
she
had
ridden
on
her
journey
from
nole
it
made
such
a
pile
of
packages
that
the
load
seemed
bigger
than
the
donkey
himself
but
he
was
a
strong
little
animal
and
made
no
complaint
of
his
burden
all
this
being
accomplished
they
set
out
one
morning
for
nole
aunt
rivette
leading
the
donkey
by
the
bridle
with
one
hand
and
little
bud
with
the
other
while
margaret
followed
behind
weeping
anew
at
this
sad
parting
with
her
old
home
and
all
she
had
so
long
loved
it
was
a
hard
journey
the
old
woman
soon
became
cross
and
fretful
and
scolded
the
little
ones
at
almost
every
step
when
bud
stumbled
as
he
often
did
for
he
was
unused
to
walking
very
far
aunt
rivette
would
box
his
ears
or
shake
him
violently
by
the
arm
or
tell
him
he
was
a
little
and
bud
would
turn
upon
her
with
a
revengeful
look
in
his
big
eyes
but
say
not
a
word
the
woman
paid
no
attention
to
meg
who
continued
to
follow
the
donkey
with
tearful
eyes
and
drooping
head
illustration
it
was
a
hard
the
first
night
they
obtained
shelter
at
a
but
in
the
morning
it
was
found
that
the
boy
s
feet
were
so
swollen
and
sore
from
the
long
walk
of
the
day
before
that
he
could
not
stand
upon
them
so
aunt
rivette
scolding
fretfully
at
his
weakness
perched
bud
among
the
bundles
atop
the
donkey
s
back
and
in
this
way
they
journeyed
the
second
day
the
woman
walking
ahead
and
leading
the
donkey
and
margaret
following
behind
the
laundress
had
hoped
to
reach
the
city
of
nole
at
the
close
of
this
day
but
the
overburdened
donkey
would
not
walk
very
fast
so
nightfall
found
them
still
a
journey
from
the
city
gates
and
they
were
forced
to
stop
at
a
small
inn
but
this
inn
was
already
overflowing
with
travelers
and
the
landlord
could
give
them
no
beds
nor
even
a
room
you
can
sleep
in
the
stable
if
you
like
said
he
there
is
plenty
of
hay
to
lie
down
so
they
were
obliged
to
content
themselves
with
this
poor
accommodation
the
old
woman
aroused
them
at
the
first
streaks
of
daybreak
the
next
morning
and
while
she
fastened
the
packages
to
the
donkey
s
back
margaret
stood
in
the
stable
yard
and
shivered
in
the
cold
morning
air
the
little
girl
felt
that
she
had
never
been
more
unhappy
than
at
that
moment
and
when
she
thought
of
her
kind
father
and
the
happy
home
she
had
once
known
her
sobs
broke
out
afresh
and
she
leaned
against
the
stable
door
and
wept
as
if
her
little
heart
would
break
illustration
over
the
youth
s
arm
lay
folded
the
magic
suddenly
some
one
touched
her
arm
and
she
looked
up
to
see
a
tall
and
handsome
youth
standing
before
her
it
was
none
other
than
ereol
the
fairy
who
had
assumed
this
form
for
her
appearance
among
mortals
and
over
the
youth
s
arm
lay
folded
the
magic
cloak
that
had
been
woven
the
evening
before
in
the
fairy
circle
of
burzee
are
you
very
unhappy
my
dear
asked
ereol
in
kindly
tones
i
am
the
most
unhappy
person
in
all
the
world
replied
the
girl
beginning
to
sob
afresh
then
said
ereol
i
will
present
you
with
this
magic
cloak
which
has
been
woven
by
the
fairies
and
while
you
wear
it
you
may
have
your
first
wish
granted
and
if
you
give
it
freely
to
any
other
mortal
that
person
may
also
have
one
wish
granted
so
use
the
cloak
wisely
and
guard
it
as
a
great
saying
this
the
fairy
messenger
spread
the
folds
of
the
cloak
and
threw
the
garment
over
the
shoulders
of
the
girl
illustration
what
punish
me
you
rascally
fellow
we
ll
see
about
just
then
aunt
rivette
led
the
donkey
from
the
stable
and
seeing
the
beautiful
cloak
which
the
child
wore
she
stopped
short
and
demanded
where
did
you
get
that
this
stranger
gave
it
to
me
answered
meg
pointing
to
the
youth
take
it
off
take
it
off
this
minute
and
give
it
i
will
whip
you
soundly
cried
the
woman
stop
said
ereol
sternly
the
cloak
belongs
to
this
child
alone
and
if
you
dare
take
it
from
her
i
will
punish
you
what
punish
me
punish
me
you
rascally
fellow
we
ll
see
about
we
will
indeed
returned
ereol
more
calmly
the
cloak
is
a
gift
from
the
fairies
and
you
dare
not
anger
them
for
your
punishment
would
be
swift
and
now
no
one
feared
to
provoke
the
mysterious
fairies
more
than
aunt
rivette
but
she
suspected
the
youth
was
not
telling
her
the
truth
so
she
rushed
upon
ereol
and
struck
at
him
with
her
upraised
cane
but
to
her
amazement
the
form
of
the
youth
vanished
quickly
into
air
and
then
indeed
she
knew
it
was
a
fairy
that
had
spoken
to
her
you
may
keep
your
cloak
she
said
to
margaret
with
a
little
shiver
of
fear
i
would
not
touch
it
for
the
world
the
girl
was
very
proud
of
her
glittering
garment
and
when
bud
was
perched
upon
the
donkey
s
back
and
the
old
woman
began
trudging
along
the
road
to
the
city
meg
followed
after
with
much
lighter
steps
than
before
presently
the
sun
rose
over
the
horizon
and
its
splendid
rays
shone
upon
the
cloak
and
made
it
glisten
gorgeously
ah
me
sighed
the
little
girl
half
aloud
i
wish
i
could
be
happy
again
then
her
childish
heart
gave
a
bound
of
delight
and
she
laughed
aloud
and
brushed
from
her
eyes
the
last
tear
she
was
destined
to
shed
for
many
a
day
for
though
she
spoke
thoughtlessly
the
magic
cloak
quickly
granted
to
its
first
wearer
the
fulfilment
of
her
wish
aunt
rivette
turned
upon
her
in
surprise
what
s
the
matter
with
you
she
asked
suspiciously
for
she
had
not
heard
the
girl
laugh
since
her
father
s
death
illustration
ah
me
sighed
the
little
girl
half
why
the
sun
is
shining
answered
meg
laughing
again
and
the
air
is
sweet
and
fresh
and
the
trees
are
green
and
beautiful
and
the
whole
world
is
very
pleasant
and
and
then
she
danced
lightly
along
the
dusty
road
and
broke
into
a
verse
of
a
pretty
song
she
had
learned
at
her
father
s
knee
the
old
woman
scowled
and
trudged
on
again
bud
looked
down
at
his
merry
sister
and
grinned
from
pure
sympathy
with
her
high
spirits
and
the
donkey
stopped
and
turned
his
head
to
look
solemnly
at
the
laughing
girl
behind
him
come
along
cried
the
laundress
jerking
at
the
bridle
every
one
is
passing
us
upon
the
road
and
we
must
hurry
to
get
home
before
it
was
true
a
good
many
travelers
some
on
horseback
and
some
on
foot
had
passed
them
by
since
the
sun
rose
and
although
the
east
gate
of
the
city
of
nole
was
now
in
sight
they
were
obliged
to
take
their
places
in
the
long
line
that
sought
entrance
at
the
gate
chapter
iv
king
bud
of
noland
the
five
high
counselors
of
the
kingdom
of
noland
were
both
eager
and
anxious
upon
this
important
morning
long
before
sunrise
tollydob
the
lord
high
general
had
assembled
his
army
at
the
east
gate
of
the
city
and
the
soldiers
stood
in
two
long
lines
beside
the
entrance
looking
very
impressive
in
their
uniforms
and
all
the
people
noting
this
unusual
display
gathered
around
at
the
gate
to
see
what
was
going
to
happen
of
course
no
one
knew
what
was
going
to
happen
not
even
the
chief
counselor
nor
his
brother
counselors
they
could
only
obey
the
law
and
abide
by
the
results
finally
the
sun
arose
and
the
east
gate
of
the
city
was
thrown
open
there
were
a
few
people
waiting
outside
and
they
promptly
entered
one
two
three
four
five
six
counted
the
chief
counselor
in
a
loud
voice
the
people
were
much
surprised
at
hearing
this
and
began
to
question
one
another
with
perplexed
looks
even
the
soldiers
were
mystified
illustration
a
ragged
limping
peddler
entered
the
seven
eight
nine
continued
the
chief
counselor
still
counting
those
who
came
in
a
breathless
hush
fell
upon
the
assemblage
something
very
important
and
mysterious
was
going
on
that
was
evident
but
what
they
could
only
wait
and
find
out
ten
eleven
counted
tullydub
and
then
heaved
a
deep
sigh
for
a
famous
nobleman
had
just
entered
the
gate
and
the
chief
counselor
could
not
help
wishing
he
had
been
number
so
the
counting
went
on
and
the
people
became
more
and
more
interested
and
excited
when
the
number
had
reached
a
strange
thing
happened
a
loud
boom
sounded
through
the
stillness
and
then
another
and
another
some
one
was
tolling
the
great
bell
in
the
palace
and
people
began
saying
to
one
another
in
awed
whispers
that
the
old
king
must
be
dead
the
five
high
counselors
filled
with
furious
anger
but
absolutely
helpless
as
they
could
not
leave
the
gate
lifted
up
their
five
chubby
fists
and
shook
them
violently
in
the
direction
of
the
poor
jikki
finding
himself
left
alone
in
the
palace
could
no
longer
resist
the
temptation
to
toll
the
bell
and
it
continued
to
peal
out
its
dull
solemn
tones
while
the
chief
counselor
stood
by
the
gate
and
shouted
only
the
mystery
of
this
action
could
have
kept
the
people
quiet
when
they
learned
from
the
bell
that
their
old
king
was
dead
but
now
they
began
to
guess
that
the
scene
at
the
east
gate
promised
more
of
interest
than
anything
they
might
learn
at
the
palace
so
they
stood
very
quiet
and
jikki
s
disobedience
of
orders
did
no
great
harm
to
the
plans
of
the
five
high
counselors
when
tullydub
had
counted
up
to
forty
the
excitement
redoubled
for
every
one
could
see
big
drops
of
perspiration
standing
upon
the
chief
counselor
s
brow
and
all
the
other
high
counselors
who
stood
just
behind
him
were
trembling
violently
with
nervousness
a
ragged
limping
peddler
entered
the
gate
shouted
tullydub
then
came
aunt
rivette
dragging
at
the
bridle
of
the
donkey
screamed
tullydub
and
now
bud
rode
through
the
gate
perched
among
the
bundles
on
the
donkey
s
back
and
looking
composedly
upon
the
throng
of
anxious
faces
that
greeted
him
illustration
cried
the
chief
counselor
long
live
the
new
king
of
noland
cried
the
chief
counselor
and
then
in
his
loudest
voice
he
continued
long
live
the
new
king
of
noland
all
the
high
counselors
prostrated
themselves
in
the
dusty
road
before
the
donkey
the
old
woman
was
thrust
back
in
the
crowd
by
a
soldier
where
she
stood
staring
in
amazement
and
margaret
clothed
in
her
beautiful
cloak
stepped
to
the
donkey
s
side
and
looked
first
at
her
brother
and
then
at
the
group
of
periwigged
men
who
bobbed
their
heads
in
the
dust
before
him
and
shouted
long
live
the
king
then
while
the
crowd
still
wondered
the
lord
high
counselor
arose
and
took
from
a
soldier
a
golden
crown
set
with
brilliants
a
jeweled
scepter
and
a
robe
of
ermine
advancing
to
bud
he
placed
the
crown
upon
the
boy
s
head
and
the
scepter
in
his
hand
while
over
his
shoulders
he
threw
the
ermine
robe
the
crown
fell
over
bud
s
ears
but
he
pushed
it
back
upon
his
head
so
it
would
stay
there
and
as
the
kingly
robe
spread
over
all
the
bundles
on
the
donkey
s
back
and
quite
covered
them
the
boy
really
presented
a
very
imposing
appearance
the
people
quickly
rose
to
the
spirit
of
the
occasion
what
mattered
it
if
the
old
king
was
dead
now
that
a
new
king
was
already
before
them
they
broke
into
a
sudden
cheer
and
joyously
waving
their
hats
and
bonnets
above
their
heads
joined
eagerly
in
the
cry
long
live
the
king
of
noland
aunt
rivette
was
fairly
stupefied
such
a
thing
was
too
wonderful
to
be
believed
a
man
in
the
crowd
snatched
the
bonnet
from
the
old
woman
s
head
and
said
to
her
brusquely
why
don
t
you
greet
the
new
king
are
you
a
traitor
to
your
country
so
she
also
waved
her
bonnet
and
screamed
long
live
the
king
but
she
hardly
knew
what
she
was
doing
or
why
she
did
it
meantime
the
high
counselors
had
risen
from
their
knees
and
now
stood
around
the
donkey
may
it
please
your
serene
majesty
to
condescend
to
tell
us
who
this
young
lady
is
asked
tullydub
bowing
respectfully
that
s
my
sister
fluff
said
bud
who
was
enjoying
his
new
position
very
much
all
the
counselors
at
this
bowed
low
to
margaret
illustration
so
she
also
waved
her
bonnet
and
screamed
long
live
the
king
a
horse
for
the
princess
fluff
cried
the
lord
high
general
and
the
next
moment
she
was
mounted
upon
a
handsome
white
palfrey
where
with
her
fluffy
golden
hair
and
smiling
face
and
the
magnificent
cloak
flowing
from
her
shoulders
she
looked
every
inch
a
princess
the
people
cheered
her
too
for
it
was
long
since
any
girl
or
woman
had
occupied
the
palace
of
the
king
of
noland
and
she
was
so
pretty
and
sweet
that
every
one
loved
her
immediately
illustration
may
it
please
your
serene
majesty
to
tell
us
who
this
young
lady
is
asked
tullydub
and
now
the
king
s
chariot
drove
up
with
its
six
prancing
steeds
and
bud
was
lifted
from
the
back
of
the
donkey
and
placed
in
the
high
seat
of
the
chariot
again
the
people
shouted
joyful
greetings
the
band
struck
up
a
gay
march
tune
and
then
the
royal
procession
started
for
the
palace
first
came
tollydob
and
the
officers
then
the
king
s
chariot
surrounded
by
soldiers
then
the
four
high
counselors
upon
black
horses
riding
two
on
each
side
of
princess
fluff
and
finally
the
band
of
musicians
and
the
remainder
of
the
royal
army
it
was
an
imposing
sight
and
the
people
followed
after
with
cheers
and
rejoicings
while
the
lord
high
tossed
silver
coins
from
his
pouch
for
any
one
to
catch
who
could
a
message
had
been
sent
to
warn
jikki
that
the
new
king
was
coming
so
he
stopped
tolling
the
death
knell
and
instead
rang
out
a
glorious
chime
of
welcome
as
for
old
rivette
finding
herself
and
the
donkey
alike
deserted
she
once
more
seized
the
bridle
and
led
the
patient
beast
to
her
humble
dwelling
and
it
was
just
as
she
reached
her
door
that
king
bud
of
noland
amid
the
cheers
and
shouts
of
thousands
entered
for
the
first
time
the
royal
palace
of
nole
illustration
i
want
some
new
clothes
and
so
does
my
sister
bud
announced
as
boldly
as
chapter
princess
fluff
now
when
the
new
king
had
entered
the
palace
with
his
sister
the
chief
counselor
stood
upon
a
golden
balcony
with
the
great
book
in
his
hand
and
read
aloud
to
all
the
people
who
were
gathered
below
the
law
in
regard
to
choosing
a
new
king
and
the
severe
penalty
in
case
any
refused
to
obey
his
slightest
wish
and
the
people
were
glad
enough
to
have
a
change
of
rulers
and
pleased
that
so
young
a
king
had
been
given
them
so
they
accepted
both
the
law
and
the
new
king
cheerfully
and
soon
dispersed
to
their
homes
to
talk
over
the
wonderful
events
of
the
day
bud
and
meg
were
ushered
into
beautifully
furnished
rooms
on
the
second
floor
of
the
palace
and
old
jikki
finding
that
he
had
a
new
master
to
serve
flew
about
in
his
usual
nervous
manner
and
brought
the
children
the
most
delicious
breakfast
they
had
ever
eaten
in
their
lives
bud
had
been
so
surprised
at
his
reception
at
the
gate
and
the
sudden
change
in
his
condition
that
as
yet
he
had
not
been
able
to
collect
his
thoughts
his
principal
idea
was
that
he
was
in
a
dream
and
he
kept
waiting
until
he
should
wake
up
but
the
breakfast
was
very
real
and
entirely
satisfying
and
he
began
to
wonder
if
he
could
be
dreaming
after
all
the
old
servant
when
he
carried
away
the
dishes
bowed
low
to
bud
and
said
beg
pardon
your
majesty
but
the
lord
high
counselor
desires
to
know
the
king
s
bud
stared
at
him
a
moment
thoughtfully
tell
him
i
want
to
be
left
alone
to
talk
with
my
sister
fluff
he
replied
jikki
again
bowed
low
and
withdrew
closing
the
door
behind
him
and
then
the
children
looked
at
each
other
solemnly
until
meg
burst
into
a
merry
laugh
oh

cried

of
it
i
m
the
royal
princess
fluff
and

and
then
she
danced
about
the
room
in
great
delight
bud
answered
her
seriously
what

it
all
mean

he
said
we

t

i
wouldn
t
be
surprised

there

no
mistake

asked
with
hesitation
there

no
mistake
returned
old
tullydub
firmly
for
we
the
five
high
counselors
of

ourselves
interpreted
and
carried
out

laws

have
to

your
majesty

the
truth
returned
the
chief
counselor
with
a
sigh
with
or
without
your
consent
you
are
the
king

is
the
and

the
others
chanted
in
a
chorus

the
bud

much
relieved
he
had
no
notion
whatever
of
refusing
to
be
a
king
if
there
was
no
mistake
and
he
was
really
the
powerful
monarch
of
noland
then
there
ought
to
be
no
end
of
fun
and
freedom
for
him
during
the
rest
of
his
life
to
be
his
own
master
to
have
plenty
of
money
to
live
in
a
palace
and
order
people
around
as
he
this
seemed
to
the
poor
and
friendless
boy
of
yesterday
to
be
quite
the
most
delightful
fate
that
could
possibly
overtake
one
so
lost
did
he
become
in
thoughts
of
the
marvelous
existence
opening
before
him
that
he
paid
scant
attention
to
the
droning
speeches
of
the
five
aged
counselors
who
were
endeavoring
to
acquaint
him
with
the
condition
of
affairs
in
his
new
kingdom
and
to
instruct
him
in
his
many
and
difficult
duties
as
its
future
ruler
for
a
full
hour
he
sat
quiet
and
motionless
and
they
thought
he
was
listening
to
these
dreary
affairs
of
state
but
suddenly
he
jumped
up
and
astonished
the
dignitaries
by
exclaiming
see
here
you
just
fix
up
things
to
suit
yourselves
i
m
going
to

with
no

the
funeral
of

funeral
he
was
ushered
into

of

the

he
whispered
to

that
it
made
him
tired

he
said
to
the

and
if

rooms
where

ordered
her
seven
maids
to

forty
of

an
imposing

of
rich
material
suitable
for
all
occasions

a
little
girl

ribbons
and
jeweled
buttons
and
clasps

each
one
had
its
hat
and
hosiery
and
slippers
to

looked
at

and
finely
woven

some
had
diamonds
and
precious
gems
sewn
on

the
poorest
suit
there
was
finer
than
the

many
articles
of
apparel
to
go
with
these
suits
such
as
shoes
with
diamond
buckles
silken
stockings

laces
and
fine
linen

a
beautiful
little
sword
with
a
gold
scabbard
and
a
jeweled
hilt

the
little
king
could
wear
on
state
occasions

when

their
satisfaction
they
began
looking
for

the
boy

until

returned
the
girl
and
going
to
the
closet
she
brought
out
the
magic
cloak
the
fairy
had
given
her
and
threw
it
over
aunt
rivette
s
shoulders
for
she
was
sorry
for
the
old
woman
and
this
was
the
prettiest
cloak
she
had
illustration
almost
before
she
knew
it
aunt
rivette
had
descended
to
the
roof
of
the
royal
so
old
rivette
feeling
very
proud
and
anxious
to
spend
her
money
left
the
palace
and
walked
as
fast
as
her
tottering
legs
would
carry
her
down
the
street
in
the
direction
of
the
shops
i
ll
buy
a
yellow
silk
she
mumbled
to
herself
half
aloud
and
a
white
velvet
and
a
purple
brocade
and
a
bonnet
with
crimson
plumes
and
won
t
the
neighbors
stare
then
oh
dear
if
i
could
only
walk
faster
and
the
shops
are
so
far
i
wish
i
could
fly
now
she
was
wearing
the
magic
cloak
when
she
expressed
this
wish
and
no
sooner
had
she
spoken
than
two
great
feathery
wings
appeared
fastened
to
her
shoulders
the
old
woman
stopped
short
turned
her
head
and
saw
the
wings
and
then
she
gave
a
scream
and
a
jump
and
began
waving
her
arms
frantically
the
wings
flopped
at
the
same
time
raising
her
slowly
from
the
ground
and
she
began
to
soar
gracefully
above
the
heads
of
the
astonished
people
who
thronged
the
streets
below
stop
help
murder
shrieked
rivette
kicking
her
feet
in
great
agitation
and
at
the
same
time
flopping
nervously
her
new
wings
save
me
some
one
save
me
why
don
t
you
save
yourself
asked
a
man
below
stop
flying
if
you
want
to
reach
the
earth
again
this
struck
old
rivette
as
a
sensible
suggestion
she
was
quite
a
distance
in
the
air
by
this
time
but
she
tried
to
hold
her
wings
steady
and
not
flop
them
and
the
result
was
that
she
began
to
float
slowly
downward
then
with
horror
she
saw
she
was
sinking
directly
upon
the
branches
of
a
tree
so
she
screamed
and
began
flying
again
and
the
swift
movement
of
her
wings
sent
her
high
into
the
air
so
great
was
her
terror
that
she
nearly
fainted
but
she
shut
her
eyes
so
that
she
might
not
see
how
high
up
she
was
and
held
her
wings
rigid
and
began
gracefully
to
float
downward
again
by
and
by
she
opened
her
eyes
and
found
one
of
her
sleeves
was
just
missing
the
sharp
point
of
a
on
a
tower
of
the
palace
so
she
began
struggling
and
flopping
anew
and
almost
before
she
knew
it
aunt
rivette
had
descended
to
the
roof
of
the
royal
stables
here
she
sat
down
and
began
to
weep
and
wail
while
a
great
crowd
gathered
below
and
watched
her
illustration

get
a

this
time
bud
and
fluff
had
come
out
to
see
what
caused
the
excitement
and
to
their
amazement
they
found
their
old
aunt
perched
high
up
on
the
stable
roof
with
two
great
wings
growing
out
from
her
back
for
a
moment
they
could
not
understand
what
had
happened

margaret

catching

of
her
nephew

niece
well

shouted
bud
gleefully
for

was
in
a
teasing
mood

see
why

t
fly
down
the

way
you
flew
and
all
the
people
shouted
yes
yes
the
king
is
right
fly
down
just
then
rivette
s
feet
began
to
slip
on
the
sloping
roof
so
she
made
a
wild
struggle
to
save
herself
and
the
result
was
that
she
fluttered
her
wings
in
just
exactly
the
right
way
to
sink
down
gradually
to
the
ground
you
ll
be
all
right
as
soon
as
you
know
how
to
use
your
wings
said
bud
with
a
laugh
but
where
did
you
get
em
anyhow
i
don

said
aunt
rivette
much
relieved
to
be
on
earth
again
and
rather
pleased
to
have
attracted
so
much
attention

the
wings

are
perfectly
lovely
cried
fluff
clapping
her
hands
in
glee

buzzard
said
bud
now
it
happened
that
all
this
praise
and
the
wondering
looks
of
the
people
did
a
great
deal
to
reconcile
rivette
to
her
new
wings
indeed
she
began
to
feel
a
certain
pride
and
distinction
in
them
and
finding
she
had
through
all
the
excitement
retained
her
grasp
on
the
purse
of
gold
she
now
wrapped
the
magic
cloak
around
her
and
walked
away
to
the
shops

there

rows
upon
rows
of

and
indecision

sighed
deeply
several
times
while
counting
out
the
money
but
the
new
king
paid
no
attention
to
old
tillydib
and
when
the
treasures
were
all
secured

their
ponies
and
rode
joyfully
back
to
the
palace
followed
in
a
procession
by
the
carriage
filled
with
dolls
and
the
cart
loaded
with

carried
upstairs
into
a
big
room

arranged
their
playthings
around
the
room
and
upon
the
tables
and
chairs
besides
littering
the
floor
so
that
they
could
hardly
find

clear
place

enough
for
some
of
their
romping
games

after

old
tullydub
was
wondering
how
he
might
best
explain
the
king
s
absence
to
the
throng
of
courtiers
gathered
to
attend
the
royal
reception
when
to
his
surprise
and
relief
his
majesty
entered
the
room
accompanied
by
the
princess
fluff
the
king
wore
a
velvet
suit
trimmed
with
gold
lace
and
at
his
side
hung
the
beautiful
jeweled
sword
meg
was
dressed
in
a
soft
white
silken
gown
and
looked
as
sweet
and
fair
as
a
lily
the
courtiers
and
their
ladies
who
were
all
wearing
their
most
handsome
and
becoming
apparel
received
their
little
king
with
great
respect
and
several
of
the
wealthiest
and
most
noble
among
them
came
up
to
bud
to
converse
with
him
but
the
king
did
not
know
what
to
say
to
these
great
personages
and
so
the
royal
reception
began
to
be
a
very
stupid
affair
fluff
saw
that
all
the
people
were
standing
in
stiff
rows
and
looking
at
one
another
uneasily
so
she
went
to
bud
and
whispered
to
him

there
a
band
of
musicians
in
the
palace
the
king
inquired
of
tellydeb
who
stood
near
yes

then
commanded
bud
presently
the
musicians
appeared
and
the
king
ordered
them
to
play
a
waltz
but
the
chief

rushed
up
and
exclaimed

added
remembering
a
time
when
his
father
the
ferryman
had
inflicted
a
like
punishment
upon
him
somewhat
to
his
surprise
tullydub
at
once
obeyed
the
command
and
then
bud
made
his
first
speech
to
the
people

said
so

a
good
many

that
evening

to
look

after

time
he
brought
old
tullydub
out
of
his
corner
and
made
the
chief

promise
to
be
good
and
not
annoy
him

bud
while
tullydub
stood
beside
the
throne
looking
somewhat
sulky
and
disagreeable
the
door
opened
and
aunt
rivette
entered
the
she
was
clothed
in
a
handsome
gown
of
velvet
trimmed
with
red
and
yellow
flowers
and
the
wings
stuck
out
from
the
folds
at
her
back
in
a
way

rivette
seemed
in
an
amiable
mood
she
smiled
and
curtsied
to
all
the
people
who
stopped
dancing
to
stare
at
her
and
she
even
fluttered
her
wings
once
or
twice
to
show
that
she
was
proud
of
being
unlike
all
the
others
present

one
screamed
murder
and
the
other
help
bud
had
to
laugh
at
her
she
looked
so
funny
and
then
a
mischievous
thought
came
to
him
and
he
commanded
old
tullydub
to
dance
with
her
but
i
don
t
dance
your
majesty
exclaimed
the
horrified
chief
counselor
try
it
i

sure
you
can
dance

bud
if
you
don

know
how
it

the
poor
man
was
forced
to
place
his
arm
about
aunt
rivette
s
waist
and
to
whirl
her
around
in
a
waltz
the
old
woman
knew
as
little
about
dancing
as
did
tullydub
and
they
were
exceedingly
awkward
bumping
into
every
one
they
came
near
presently
aunt
rivette

feet
slipped
and
she
would
have
tumbled
upon
the
floor
with
the
chief
counselor
had
she
not
begun
to
flutter
her
wings
wildly
so
instead
of
falling
she
rose
gradually
into
the
air
carrying
tullydub
with
her
for
they
clung
to
each
other
in
terror
and
one
screamed
murder
and
the
other
help
in
their
loudest
voices
bud
laughed
until
the
tears
stood
in
his
eyes
but
aunt
rivette
after
bumping
both
her
own
head
and
that
of
the
chief
counselor
against
the
ceiling
several
times
finally
managed
to
control
the
action
of
her
wings
and
to
descend
to
the
floor
again
as
soon
as
he
was
released
old
tullydub
fled
from
the
room
and
aunt
rivette
vowing
she
would
dance
no
more
seated
herself
beside
bud
and
watched
the
revel
until
nearly
midnight
when
the
couriers
and
their
ladies
dispersed
to
their
own
homes
declaring
that
they
had
never
enjoyed

and
carry
down
this
tray
of
breakfast
dishes
and
send
this
hat
to
the
milliner
to
have
the
feathers
curled
and
return
this
cloak
to
the
princess
fluff
with
my
compliments
and
say
i
m
much
obliged
for
the
loan
of
poor
jikki
hardly
knew
how
to
manage
so
many
orders
he
took
the
shoes
in
his
left
hand
and
the
tray
of
dishes
he
balanced
upon
the
other
upraised
palm
but
the
hat
and
cloak
were
too
many
for
him
so
aunt
rivette
calling
him
a
stupid
idiot
because
he
had
no
more
hands
the
plumed
hat
upon
jikki
s
head
and
spread
the
cloak
over
his
shoulders
and
ordered
him
to
make
haste
away
jikki
was
glad
enough
to
go
for
the
fluttering
of
aunt
rivette
s
wings
made
him
nervous
but
he
had
to
descend
the
stairs
cautiously
for
the
hat
was
tipped
nearly
over
his
eyes
and
if
he
stumbled
he
would
be
sure
to
spill
the
tray
of
dishes
he
reached
the
first
landing
of
the
broad
stairs
in
safety
but
at
the
second
landing
the
hat
joggled
forward
so
that
he
could
see
nothing
at
all
and
one
of
the
shoes
dropped
from
his
hand
dear
me
sighed
the
old
man
i
wonder
what
i
shall
do
now
if
i
pick
up
the
shoe
i
shall
drop
the
dishes
and
i
can
t
set
down
this
tray
because
i
m
blinded
by
this
terrible
hat
if
i
m
to
be
at
the
beck
and
call
of
that
old
woman
and
serve
the
new
king
at
the
same
time
i
shall
have
my
hands
full
my
hands
in
fact
are
full
now
i
really
wish
i
had
half
a
dozen
servants
to
wait
on
jikki
knew
nothing
at
all
about
the
magic
power
of
the
cloak
that
fell
from
his
shoulders
so
his
astonishment
was
profound
when
some
one
seized
the
shoe
from
his
left
hand
and
some
one
else
removed
the
tray
from
his
right
hand
and
still
another
person
snatched
the
plumed
hat
from
his
head
but
then
he
saw
bowing
and
smirking
before
him
six
young
men
who
looked
as
much
alike
as
peas
in
the
same
pod
and
all
of
whom
wore
very
neat
and
handsome
liveries
of
with
silver
buttons
on
their
coats
jikki
blinked
and
stared
at
these
people
and
rubbed
his
eyes
to
make
sure
he
was
awake
who
are
you
he
managed
to
ask
we
are
your
half
a
dozen
servants
sir
answered
the
young
men
speaking
all
together
and
bowing
again
jikki
gasped
and
raised
his
hands
with
sudden
amazement
as
he
gazed
in
wonder
upon
the
row
of
six
smart
servants
you
doing
here
he
stammered
we
are
here
to
wait
upon
you
sir
as
is
our
duty
they
answered
respectfully
jikki
rubbed
his
left
ear
as
was
his
custom
when
perplexed
and
then
he
thought
it
all
over
and
the
more
he
thought
the
more
perplexed
he
became
i
don
t
understand
he
finally
said
in
a
weak
voice
illustration
you
wished
for
us
and
here
we
are
declared
the
you
wished
for
us
and
here
we
are
declared
the
six
once
more
bowing
low
before
him
i
know
said
jikki
but
i
ve
often
wished
for
many
other
never
got
a
single
one
of
the
wishes
before
the
young
men
did
not
attempt
to
explain
this
curious
fact
they
stood
in
a
straight
row
before
their
master
as
if
awaiting
his
orders
one
held
the
shoe
jikki
had
dropped
another
its
mate
still
another
the
plumed
hat
and
a
fourth
the
tray
of
dishes
you
see
remarked
jikki
shaking
his
head
sadly
at
the
six
i
m
only
a
servant
you
are
our
master
sir
announced
the
young
men
their
voices
blended
into
one
i
wish
said
jikki
solemnly
you
were
all
back
where
you
came
from
and
then
he
paused
to
see
if
his
wish
also
would
be
fulfilled
but
no
the
magic
cloak
conferred
the
fulfilment
of
but
one
wish
upon
its
wearer
and
the
half
a
dozen
servants
remained
standing
rigidly
before
him
jikki
arose
with
a
sigh
come
downstairs
to
my
private
room
he
said
and
we
ll
talk
the
matter
so
they
descended
the
grand
stairway
to
the
main
hall
of
the
grand
palace
jikki
going
first
and
his
servants
following
at
a
respectful
distance
just
off
the
hall
jikki
had
a
pleasant
room
where
he
could
sit
when
not
employed
and
into
this
he
led
the
six
after
all
he
considered
it
would
not
be
a
bad
thing
to
have
half
a
dozen
servants
they
would
save
his
old
legs
from
many
a
tiresome
errand
but
just
as
they
reached
the
hall
a
new
thought
struck
him
and
he
turned
suddenly
upon
his
followers
see
here
he
exclaimed
how
much
wages
do
you
fellows
expect
we
expect
no
wages
at
all
sir
they
answered
what
nothing
at
all
jikki
was
so
startled
that
he
scarcely
had
strength
remaining
to
stagger
into
his
private
room
and
sink
into
a
chair
no
wages
six
servants
and
no
wages
to
pay
he
muttered
why
it
s
then
he
thought
to
himself
i
ll
try
em
and
see
if
they
ll
really
and
aloud
he
asked
how
can
i
tell
you
from
another
each
servant
raised
his
right
arm
and
pointed
to
a
silver
badge
upon
his
left
breast
and
then
jikki
discovered
that
they
were
all
numbered
from
one
up
to
ah
very
good
said
jikki
now
number
six
take
this
shoe
into
the
and
clean
and
polish
number
six
bowed
and
glided
from
the
room
as
swiftly
and
silently
as
if
he
were
obeying
a
command
of
the
king
of
noland
number
five
continued
jikki
take
this
tray
to
the
number
five
obeyed
instantly
and
jikki
chuckled
with
delight
number
two
take
this
to
the
milliner
in
royal
street
and
have
the
feathers
number
two
bowed
and
departed
almost
before
the
words
had
left
jikki
s
mouth
and
then
the
king
s
valet
regarded
the
remaining
three
in
some
perplexity
half
a
dozen
servants
is
almost
too
many
he
thought
it
will
keep
me
busy
to
keep
them
busy
i
should
have
wished
for
only
two
at
the
just
then
he
remembered
something
number
four
said
he
go
after
number
two
and
tell
the
milliner
that
the
hat
belongs
to
madam
rivette
the
king
s
and
a
few
moments
later
when
the
remaining
two
servants
standing
upright
before
him
had
begun
to
make
him
nervous
jikki
cried
out
number
three
take
this
other
shoe
down
to
the
and
tell
number
six
to
clean
and
polish
it
this
left
but
one
of
the
six
unoccupied
and
jikki
was
wondering
what
to
do
with
him
when
a
bell
rang
that
s
the
king
s
bell
said
jikki
i
am
not
the
king
s
servant
i
am
here
only
to
wait
upon
you
said
number
one
without
moving
to
answer
the
bell
then
i
must
go
myself
sighed
the
valet
and
rushed
away
to
obey
the
king
s
summons
scarcely
had
he
disappeared
when
tollydob
the
lord
high
general
entered
the
room
and
said
in
a
gruff
voice
where
is
jikki
where
s
that
rascal
jikki
number
one
standing
stiffly
at
one
end
of
the
room
made
no
reply
answer
me
you
scoundrel
roared
the
old
general
where
s
jikki
still
number
one
stood
silent
and
this
so
enraged
old
tollydob
that
he
raised
his
cane
and
aimed
a
furious
blow
at
the
young
man
the
cane
seemed
to
pass
directly
through
the
fellow
and
it
struck
the
wall
behind
so
forcibly
that
it
split
into
two
parts
this
amazed
tollydob
he
stared
a
moment
at
the
silent
servant
and
then
turned
his
back
upon
him
and
sat
down
in
jikki
s
chair
here
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
magic
cloak
which
the
king
s
valet
had
thrown
down
tollydob
attracted
by
the
gorgeous
coloring
and
soft
texture
of
the
garment
picked
up
the
cloak
and
threw
it
over
his
shoulders
and
then
he
walked
to
a
mirror
and
began
admiring
his
reflection
while
thus
engaged
jikki
returned
and
the
valet
was
so
startled
at
seeing
the
lord
high
general
that
he
never
noticed
the
cloak
at
all
his
majesty
has
asked
to
see
your
highness
said
jikki
and
i
was
about
to
go
in
search
of
i
ll
go
to
the
king
at
once
answered
tollydob
and
as
he
walked
away
jikki
suddenly
noticed
that
he
was
wearing
the
cloak
oho
thought
the
valet
he
has
gone
off
with
the
princess
fluff
s
pretty
cloak
but
when
he
returns
from
the
king
s
chamber
i
ll
get
it
again
and
send
number
one
to
carry
it
to
its
rightful
chapter
x
the
counselors
wear
the
magic
cloak
when
tollydob
still
wearing
the
magic
cloak
had
bowed
before
the
king
bud
asked
how
many
men
are
there
in
the
royal
army
general
seven
thousand
seven
hundred
and
may
it
please
your
gracious
majesty
returned
that
is
without
counting
and
do
they
obey
your
orders
promptly
inquired
bud
who
felt
a
little
doubt
on
this
point
yes
indeed
answered
the
general
proudly
they
are
terribly
afraid
of
my
and
yet
you
re
a
very
small
man
to
command
so
large
an
army
said
the
king
the
lord
high
general
flushed
with
shame
for
although
he
was
both
old
and
fat
he
was
so
short
of
stature
that
he
stood
but
a
trifle
taller
than
bud
himself
and
like
all
short
men
he
was
very
sensitive
about
his
height
i
m
a
terrible
fighter
your
majesty
declared
tollydob
earnestly
and
when
i
m
on
horseback
my
small
size
is
little
noticed
nevertheless
he
added
with
a
sigh
it
is
a
good
thing
to
be
tall
i
wish
i
were
ten
feet
no
sooner
were
the
words
spoken
than
bud
gave
a
cry
of
astonishment
for
the
general
s
head
shot
suddenly
upward
until
his
gorgeous
hat
struck
the
ceiling
and
was
jammed
down
tightly
over
the
startled
man
s
eyes
and
nose
the
room
was
just
ten
feet
high
and
tollydob
was
now
ten
feet
tall
but
for
a
time
the
old
general
could
not
think
what
had
happened
to
him
and
bud
observing
for
the
first
time
that
tollydob
wore
the
magic
cloak
began
to
shriek
with
laughter
at
the
comical
result
of
the
old
man
s
wish
hearing
the
king
laugh
the
general
tore
the
hat
from
his
head
and
looked
at
himself
in
mingled
terror
and
admiration
from
being
a
very
small
man
he
had
suddenly
become
a
giant
and
the
change
was
so
great
that
tollydob
might
well
be
amazed
illustration
i
wish
i
were
ten
feet
what
has
happened
your
majesty
he
asked
in
a
trembling
voice
why
don
t
you
see
you
were
wearing
my
sister
s
magic
cloak
said
bud
still
laughing
at
the
big
man
s
woeful
face
and
it
grants
to
every
wearer
the
fulfillment
of
one
only
one
inquired
poor
tollydob
i
d
like
to
be
a
little
smaller
i
it
can
t
be
helped
now
said
bud
you
wished
to
be
ten
feet
tall
and
there
you
are
and
there
you
ll
have
to
stay
tollydob
whether
you
like
it
or
not
but
i
m
very
proud
of
you
you
must
be
the
greatest
general
in
all
the
world
you
know
tollydob
brightened
up
at
this
and
tried
to
sit
down
in
a
chair
but
it
crushed
to
pieces
under
his
weight
so
he
sighed
and
remained
standing
then
he
threw
the
magic
cloak
upon
the
floor
with
a
little
shudder
at
its
fairy
powers
and
said
if
i
d
only
known
i
might
have
become
just
six
feet
tall
instead
of
ten
never
mind
said
bud
consolingly
if
we
ever
have
a
war
you
will
strike
terror
into
the
ranks
of
the
enemy
and
every
one
in
noland
will
admire
you
immensely
hereafter
you
will
be
not
only
the
lord
high
general
but
the
lord
high
so
tollydob
went
away
to
show
himself
to
the
chief
counselor
and
he
had
to
stoop
very
low
to
pass
through
the
doorway
when
jikki
saw
the
gigantic
man
coming
out
of
the
king
s
chamber
he
gave
a
scream
and
fled
in
terror
and
strange
to
say
this
effect
was
very
agreeable
to
the
lord
high
general
who
loved
to
make
people
fear
him
bud
ran
to
tell
fluff
of
the
curious
thing
that
had
happened
to
his
general
and
so
it
was
that
when
the
lord
high
executioner
entered
the
palace
there
was
no
one
around
to
receive
him
he
made
his
way
into
the
king
s
chamber
and
there
he
found
the
magic
cloak
lying
upon
the
floor
i
ve
seen
the
princess
fluff
wearing
this
thought
the
lord
high
executioner
so
it
must
belong
to
her
i
ll
take
it
to
her
rooms
for
it
is
far
too
pretty
to
be
lying
around
in
this
careless
way
and
jikki
ought
to
be
scolded
for
allowing
so
tellydeb
picked
up
the
cloak
and
laid
it
over
his
arm
then
he
admired
the
bright
hues
that
ran
through
the
fabric
and
presently
his
curiosity
got
the
better
of
him
he
decided
to
try
it
on
and
see
how
he
would
look
in
it
while
thus
employed
the
sound
of
a
girl
s
sweet
laughter
fell
upon
tellydeb
s
ears
seeming
to
come
from
a
far
distance
the
princess
must
be
in
the
royal
gardens
he
said
to
himself
i
ll
go
there
and
find
so
the
lord
high
executioner
walked
through
the
great
hall
still
wearing
the
cloak
and
finally
came
to
the
back
of
the
palace
and
passed
a
doorway
leading
into
the
gardens
all
was
quiet
here
save
for
the
song
of
the
birds
as
they
fluttered
among
the
trees
but
at
the
other
end
of
the
garden
tellydeb
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
white
gown
which
he
suspected
might
be
that
of
the
little
princess
he
walked
along
the
paths
slowly
enjoying
the
scent
of
the
flowers
and
the
peacefulness
of
the
scene
for
the
lord
high
executioner
was
a
man
and
delighted
in
beautiful
sights
after
a
time
he
reached
a
and
saw
hanging
far
up
in
a
big
tree
a
fine
red
apple
tellydeb
paused
and
looked
at
this
longingly
i
wish
i
could
reach
that
apple
he
said
with
a
sigh
as
he
extended
his
arm
upward
instantly
the
arm
stretched
toward
the
apple
which
was
at
least
forty
feet
away
from
the
lord
high
executioner
and
while
the
astonished
man
eyed
his
elongated
arm
in
surprise
the
hand
clutched
the
apple
plucked
it
and
drew
it
back
to
him
and
there
he
apple
in
his
hand
and
his
arm
apparently
the
same
as
it
had
been
before
he
accomplished
the
wonderful
feat
illustration
i
wish
i
could
reach
that
apple
he
said
with
a
sigh
as
he
extended
his
arm
for
a
moment
the
counselor
was
overcome
with
fear
the
cloak
dropped
unnoticed
from
his
shoulders
and
fell
upon
the
graveled
walk
while
tellydeb
sank
upon
a
bench
and
shivered
was
like
magic
he
murmured
i
but
reached
out
my
went
nearly
to
the
top
of
the
tree
here
he
gave
a
cry
of
wonder
for
again
his
arm
stretched
the
distance
and
touched
the
topmost
branches
of
the
tree
he
drew
it
back
hastily
and
turned
to
see
if
any
one
had
observed
him
but
this
part
of
the
garden
was
deserted
so
the
old
man
eagerly
tested
his
new
accomplishment
he
plucked
a
rose
from
a
bush
a
dozen
yards
to
the
right
and
having
smelled
its
odor
he
placed
it
in
a
vase
that
stood
twenty
feet
to
his
left
then
he
noted
a
fountain
far
across
a
hedge
and
reaching
the
distance
easily
dipped
his
hand
in
the
splashing
water
it
was
all
very
amazing
this
sudden
power
to
reach
a
great
distance
and
the
lord
high
executioner
was
so
pleased
with
the
faculty
that
when
he
discovered
old
jikki
standing
in
the
palace
doorway
he
laughingly
fetched
him
a
box
on
the
ear
that
sent
the
valet
scampering
away
to
his
room
in
amazed
terror
said
tellydeb
to
himself
now
i
ll
go
home
and
show
my
wife
what
a
surprising
gift
i
have
so
he
left
the
garden
and
not
long
afterward
old
tallydab
the
lord
high
steward
came
walking
down
the
path
followed
by
his
little
dog
ruffles
i
am
not
certain
whether
it
was
because
his
coat
was
so
shaggy
or
his
temper
so
uncertain
that
tallydab
s
dog
was
named
ruffles
but
the
name
fitted
well
both
the
looks
and
the
disposition
of
the
tiny
animal
nevertheless
the
lord
high
steward
was
very
fond
of
his
dog
which
followed
him
everywhere
except
to
the
king
s
and
often
the
old
man
would
tell
ruffles
his
troubles
and
worries
and
talk
to
the
dog
just
as
one
would
to
a
person
as
they
came
slowly
down
the
tallydab
noticed
a
splendid
cloak
lying
upon
the
path
how
very
beautiful
he
exclaimed
as
he
stooped
to
pick
it
up
i
have
never
seen
anything
like
this
since
the
princess
fluff
first
rode
into
nole
beside
her
brother
the
king
isn
t
it
a
lovely
cloak
ruffles
the
dog
gave
a
subdued
yelp
and
wagged
his
stubby
tail
how
do
i
look
in
it
ruffles
continued
the
lord
high
steward
wrapping
the
folds
of
the
magic
cloak
about
him
how
do
i
look
in
such
gorgeous
apparel
the
dog
stopped
wagging
its
tail
and
looked
up
at
its
master
earnestly
how
do
i
look
again
said
tallydab
i
declare
i
wish
you
could
talk
you
look
perfectly
ridiculous
replied
the
dog
in
a
rather
harsh
voice
the
lord
high
steward
jumped
nearly
three
feet
in
the
air
so
startled
was
he
by
ruffles
s
reply
then
he
bent
down
a
hand
on
each
knee
and
regarded
the
dog
curiously
i
thought
at
first
you
had
spoken
said
he
what
caused
you
to
change
your
mind
asked
ruffles
peevishly
i
speaking
can
t
you
believe
it
the
lord
high
steward
drew
a
deep
sigh
of
conviction
illustration
you
look
perfectly
ridiculous
replied
the
i
believe
it
he
made
answer
i
have
always
declared
you
were
a
wonderful
dog
and
now
you
prove
i
am
right
why
you
are
the
only
dog
i
ever
heard
of
who
could
talk
except
in
fairy
tales
said
ruffles
calmly
don
t
forget
the
fairy
i
don
t
forget
replied
tallydab
but
this
isn
t
a
fairy
tale
ruffles
it
s
real
life
in
the
kingdom
of
to
be
sure
answered
ruffles
but
see
here
my
dear
master
now
that
i
am
at
last
able
to
talk
please
allow
me
to
ask
you
for
something
decent
to
eat
i
d
like
a
good
meal
for
once
just
to
see
what
it
is
a
good
meal
exclaimed
the
steward
why
my
friend
don
t
i
give
you
a
big
bone
every
day
you
do
said
the
dog
and
i
nearly
break
my
teeth
on
it
trying
to
crack
it
to
get
a
little
marrow
whatever
induces
people
to
give
their
dogs
bones
instead
of
meat
why
i
thought
you
liked
bones
protested
tallydab
sitting
on
the
bench
and
looking
at
his
dog
in
astonishment
well
i
don
t
i
prefer
something
to
good
and
wholesome
such
as
you
eat
yourself
growled
ruffles
the
lord
high
steward
gave
a
laugh
illustration
why
i
thought
you
liked
bones
protested
tallydab
sitting
on
the
bench
and
looking
at
his
dog
in
why
said
he
don
t
you
remember
that
old
mother
hubbard
ah
that
a
fairy
tale
interrupted
ruffles
impatiently
and
there
wasn
t
even
a
bone
in
her
cupboard
after
all
don
t
mention
mother
hubbard
to
me
if
you
want
to
retain
my
and
that
reminds
me
resumed
the
steward
with
a
scowl
that
a
few
minutes
ago
you
said
i
looked
ridiculous
in
this
lovely
you
do
said
ruffles
with
a
sniff
it
is
a
girl
s
cloak
and
not
fit
for
a
wrinkled
old
man
like
i
believe
you
are
right
answered
tallydab
with
a
sigh
and
he
removed
the
cloak
from
his
shoulders
and
hung
it
over
the
back
of
the
garden
seat
in
regard
to
the
meat
that
you
so
long
for
he
added
if
you
will
follow
me
to
the
royal
kitchen
i
will
see
that
you
have
all
you
spoken
like
a
good
friend
exclaimed
the
dog
let
us
go
at
so
they
passed
down
the
garden
to
the
kitchen
door
and
the
magic
cloak
which
had
wrought
such
wonderful
things
that
day
still
remained
neglectfully
cast
aside
it
was
growing
dusk
when
old
tillydib
the
lord
high
stole
into
the
garden
and
sat
upon
the
bench
to
smoke
his
pipe
in
peace
all
the
afternoon
he
had
been
worried
by
people
with
bills
for
this
thing
or
that
and
the
royal
purse
was
very
light
indeed
when
tillydib
had
at
last
managed
to
escape
to
the
garden
if
this
keeps
up
he
reflected
there
will
be
no
money
left
and
then
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
what
will
become
of
us
all
the
air
was
chilly
the
old
counselor
shivered
a
little
and
noting
the
cloak
that
lay
over
the
back
of
the
seat
drew
it
about
his
shoulders
it
will
be
five
months
he
muttered
half
aloud
before
we
can
tax
the
people
for
more
money
and
before
five
months
are
up
the
king
and
his
counselors
may
all
starve
to
in
this
splendid
palace
i
wish
the
royal
purse
would
always
remain
full
no
matter
how
much
money
i
drew
from
it
the
big
purse
which
had
lain
lightly
on
his
knee
now
slid
off
and
pulled
heavily
upon
the
golden
chain
which
the
old
man
wore
around
his
neck
to
fasten
the
purse
to
him
securely
aroused
from
his
anxious
thoughts
tillydib
lifted
the
purse
to
his
lap
again
and
was
astonished
to
feel
its
weight
he
opened
the
clasp
and
saw
that
the
huge
sack
was
actually
running
over
with
gold
pieces
illustration
i
wish
the
royal
purse
would
always
remain
full
no
matter
how
much
money
i
drew
from
it
now
where
on
earth
did
all
this
wealth
come
from
he
exclaimed
shaking
his
head
in
a
puzzled
way
i
ll
go
at
once
and
pay
some
of
the
creditors
who
are
waiting
for
so
he
ran
to
the
royal
treasury
which
was
a
front
room
in
the
palace
and
began
paying
every
one
who
presented
an
account
he
expected
presently
to
empty
the
purse
but
no
matter
how
heavily
he
drew
upon
the
contents
it
remained
ever
as
full
as
in
the
beginning
it
must
be
thought
the
old
man
when
the
last
bill
had
been
paid
that
my
idle
wish
has
in
some
mysterious
way
been
but
he
did
not
know
he
owed
his
good
fortune
to
the
magic
cloak
which
he
still
wore
as
he
was
leaving
the
room
he
met
the
king
and
princess
fluff
who
were
just
come
from
dinner
and
the
girl
exclaimed
why
there
is
my
cloak
where
did
you
get
it
tillydib
i
found
it
in
the
garden
answered
the
lord
high
but
take
it
if
it
is
yours
and
here
is
something
to
repay
you
for
the
loan
of
it
and
he
poured
into
her
hands
a
heap
of
glittering
gold
oh
thank
you
cried
fluff
and
taking
the
precious
cloak
she
dropped
the
gold
into
it
and
carried
it
to
her
room
i
ll
never
lend
it
again
unless
it
is
really
necessary
she
said
to
herself
it
was
very
careless
of
aunt
rivette
to
leave
my
fairy
cloak
in
the
and
then
after
carefully
folding
it
and
wrapping
it
up
she
locked
it
in
a
drawer
and
hid
the
key
where
no
one
but
herself
could
find
it
illustration
this
was
the
moment
quavo
had
eagerly
chapter
xi
the
it
is
not
very
far
from
the
kingdom
of
noland
to
the
kingdom
of
ix
if
you
followed
the
steps
of
quavo
the
minstrel
you
would
climb
the
sides
of
a
steep
and
go
down
on
the
other
side
and
cross
a
broad
and
swift
river
and
pick
your
way
through
a
dark
forest
you
would
then
have
reached
the
land
of
ix
and
would
find
an
easy
path
into
the
big
city
but
even
before
one
came
to
the
city
he
would
see
the
high
marble
towers
of
queen
zixi
s
magnificent
palace
and
pause
to
wonder
at
its
beauty
quavo
the
minstrel
had
been
playing
his
harp
in
the
city
of
nole
and
his
eyes
were
sharp
so
he
had
seen
many
things
to
gossip
and
sing
about
and
therefore
never
doubted
he
would
be
warmly
welcomed
by
queen
zixi
he
reached
the
marble
palace
about
dusk
one
evening
and
was
bidden
to
the
feast
which
was
about
to
be
served
a
long
table
ran
down
the
length
of
the
lofty
hall
built
in
the
center
of
the
palace
and
this
table
was
covered
with
gold
and
silver
platters
bearing
many
kinds
of
meats
and
fruits
and
vegetables
while
tall
ornamented
stands
contained
sweets
and
delicacies
to
tickle
the
palate
at
the
head
of
the
table
on
a
jeweled
throne
sat
queen
zixi
herself
a
vision
of
radiant
beauty
and
charming
grace
her
hair
was
yellow
as
spun
gold
and
her
wondrous
eyes
raven
black
in
hue
her
skin
was
fair
as
a
lily
save
where
her
cheek
was
faintly
tinted
with
a
flush
of
dainty
and
lovely
indeed
was
the
queen
of
ix
in
appearance
yet
none
of
her
lords
or
attendants
cast
more
than
a
passing
glance
upon
her
beauty
for
they
were
used
to
seeing
her
thus
there
were
graybeards
at
her
table
this
evening
who
could
remember
the
queen
s
rare
beauty
since
they
were
boys
ay
and
who
had
been
told
by
their
fathers
and
grandfathers
of
queen
zixi
s
loveliness
when
they
also
were
mere
children
in
fact
no
one
in
ix
had
ever
heard
of
the
time
when
the
land
was
not
ruled
by
this
same
queen
or
when
she
was
not
in
appearance
as
young
and
fair
as
she
was
which
easily
proves
she
was
not
an
ordinary
person
at
all
and
i
may
as
well
tell
you
here
that
queen
zixi
despite
the
fact
that
she
looked
to
be
no
more
than
sixteen
was
in
reality
six
hundred
and
years
of
age
and
had
prolonged
her
life
in
this
extraordinary
way
by
means
of
the
arts
of
witchcraft
i
do
not
mean
by
this
that
she
was
an
evil
person
she
had
always
ruled
her
kingdom
wisely
and
liberally
and
the
people
of
ix
made
no
manner
of
complaint
against
their
queen
if
there
were
a
war
she
led
her
armies
in
person
clad
in
golden
mail
and
helmet
and
in
years
of
peace
she
taught
them
to
sow
and
reap
grain
and
to
fashion
many
useful
articles
of
metal
and
to
build
strong
and
substantial
houses
nor
were
her
taxes
ever
more
than
the
people
could
bear
yet
for
all
this
zixi
was
more
feared
than
loved
for
every
one
remembered
she
was
a
witch
and
also
knew
she
was
hundreds
of
years
old
so
no
matter
how
amiable
their
queen
might
be
she
was
always
treated
with
extreme
respect
and
folks
weighed
well
their
words
when
they
conversed
with
her
illustration
stop
cried
the
queen
with
sudden
next
the
queen
on
both
sides
of
the
table
sat
her
most
favored
nobles
and
their
ladies
farther
down
were
the
rich
merchants
and
officers
of
the
army
and
at
the
lower
end
were
servants
and
members
of
the
household
for
this
was
the
custom
in
the
land
of
ix
quavo
the
harpist
sat
near
the
lower
end
and
when
all
had
been
comfortably
fed
the
queen
called
upon
him
for
a
song
this
was
the
moment
quavo
had
eagerly
awaited
he
took
his
harp
seated
himself
in
a
niche
of
the
wall
and
according
to
the
manner
of
ancient
minstrels
he
sang
of
the
things
he
had
seen
in
other
lands
thus
serving
his
hearers
with
the
news
of
the
day
as
well
as
pleasing
them
with
his
music
this
is
the
way
he
began
of
noland
now
a
tale
i
ll
sing
where
reigns
a
strangely
youthful
a
boy
who
has
by
chance
alone
been
called
to
sit
upon
a
throne
his
sister
shares
his
luck
and
she
the
fairies
friend
is
said
to
be
for
they
did
mystic
arts
invoke
and
weave
for
her
a
magic
cloak
which
grants
its
i
m
gifts
more
precious
far
than
gold
she
s
but
to
wish
and
her
desire
quite
instantly
she
will
acquire
and
when
she
lends
it
to
her
friends
the
favor
unto
them
extends
for
one
who
wears
the
cloak
can
fly
like
any
eagle
in
the
sky
and
one
did
wish
by
sudden
freak
his
dog
be
granted
power
to
speak
and
now
the
beast
can
talk
as
well
as
i
and
also
read
and
spell
stop
cried
the
queen
with
sudden
excitement
do
you
lie
minstrel
or
are
you
speaking
the
truth
secretly
glad
that
his
news
was
received
thus
eagerly
quavo
continued
to
twang
the
harp
as
he
replied
in
verse
now
may
i
die
at
break
of
day
if
false
is
any
word
i
and
what
is
this
cloak
who
owns
it
demanded
the
queen
impetuously
sang
the
minstrel
the
cloak
belongs
to
princess
fluff
tis
woven
of
some
secret
stuff
which
makes
it
gleam
with
splendor
bright
that
fills
beholders
with
thereafter
the
beautiful
zixi
remained
lost
in
thought
her
dainty
chin
resting
within
the
hollow
of
her
hand
and
her
eyes
dreamily
fixed
upon
the
minstrel
illustration
she
made
a
solemn
vow
that
she
would
secure
the
magic
cloak
within
a
and
quavo
judging
that
his
news
had
brought
him
into
rare
favor
told
more
and
more
wonderful
tales
of
the
magic
cloak
some
of
which
were
true
while
others
were
mere
inventions
of
his
own
for
newsmongers
as
every
one
knows
were
ever
unable
to
stick
to
facts
since
the
world
began
all
the
courtiers
and
officers
and
servants
listened
with
wide
eyes
and
parted
lips
to
the
song
marveling
greatly
at
what
they
had
heard
and
when
it
was
finally
ended
and
the
evening
far
spent
queen
zixi
threw
a
golden
chain
to
the
minstrel
as
a
reward
and
left
the
hall
attended
by
her
maidens
throughout
the
night
which
followed
she
tossed
sleeplessly
upon
her
bed
thinking
of
the
magic
cloak
and
longing
to
possess
it
and
when
the
morning
sun
rose
over
the
horizon
she
made
a
solemn
vow
that
she
would
secure
the
magic
cloak
within
a
year
even
if
it
cost
her
the
half
of
her
kingdom
now
the
reason
for
this
rash
vow
showing
zixi
s
intense
desire
to
possess
the
cloak
was
very
peculiar
although
she
had
been
an
adept
at
witchcraft
for
more
than
six
hundred
years
and
was
able
to
retain
her
health
and
remain
in
appearance
young
and
beautiful
there
was
one
thing
her
art
was
unable
to
deceive
and
that
one
thing
was
a
mirror
illustration
queen
zixi
left
the
hall
attended
by
her
to
mortal
eyes
zixi
was
charming
and
attractive
yet
her
reflection
in
a
mirror
showed
to
her
an
ugly
old
hag
bald
of
head
wrinkled
with
toothless
gums
and
withered
sunken
cheeks
for
this
reason
the
queen
had
no
mirror
of
any
sort
about
the
palace
even
from
her
own
the
mirror
had
been
banished
and
she
depended
upon
her
maids
and
to
make
her
look
as
lovely
as
possible
she
knew
she
was
beautiful
in
appearance
to
others
her
maids
declared
it
continually
and
in
all
eyes
she
truly
read
admiration
but
zixi
wanted
to
admire
herself
and
that
was
impossible
so
long
as
the
cold
mirrors
showed
her
reflection
to
be
the
old
hag
others
would
also
have
seen
had
not
her
arts
of
witchcraft
deceived
them
everything
else
a
woman
and
a
queen
might
desire
zixi
was
able
to
obtain
by
her
arts
yet
the
one
thing
she
could
have
made
her
very
unhappy
as
i
have
already
said
she
was
not
a
bad
queen
she
used
her
knowledge
of
sorcery
to
please
her
own
fancy
or
to
benefit
her
kingdom
but
never
to
injure
any
one
else
so
she
may
be
forgiven
for
wanting
to
see
a
beautiful
girl
reflected
in
a
mirror
instead
of
a
haggard
old
woman
in
her
six
hundred
and
year
zixi
had
given
up
all
hope
of
ever
accomplishing
her
object
until
she
heard
of
the
magic
cloak
the
powers
of
witches
are
somewhat
limited
but
she
knew
that
the
powers
of
fairies
are
boundless
so
if
the
magic
cloak
could
grant
any
human
wish
as
quavo
s
song
had
told
her
was
the
case
she
would
manage
to
secure
it
and
would
at
once
wish
for
a
reflection
in
the
mirror
of
the
same
features
all
others
then
she
would
become
happy
and
content

zixi
disguises
herself
now
as
might
be
expected
queen
zixi
lost
no
time
in
endeavoring
to
secure
the
magic
cloak
the
people
of
ix
were
not
on
friendly
terms
with
the
people
of
noland
so
she
could
not
visit
princess
fluff
openly
and
she
knew
it
was
useless
to
try
to
borrow
so
priceless
a
treasure
as
a
cloak
which
had
been
the
gift
of
the
fairies
but
one
way
remained
to
steal
the
precious
robe
so
she
began
her
preparations
by
telling
her
people
she
would
be
absent
from
ix
for
a
month
and
then
she
retired
to
her
own
room
and
mixed
by
the
rules
of
witchcraft
a
black
mess
in
a
silver
kettle
and
boiled
it
until
it
was
as
thick
as
molasses
of
this
inky
mixture
she
swallowed
two
teaspoonfuls
every
hour
for
six
hours
muttering
an
incantation
each
time
at
the
end
of
the
six
hours
her
golden
hair
had
become
brown
and
her
black
eyes
had
become
blue
and
this
was
quite
sufficient
to
disguise
the
pretty
queen
so
that
no
one
would
recognize
her
then
she
took
off
her
richly
embroidered
queenly
robes
and
hung
them
up
in
a
closet
putting
on
a
simple
gingham
dress
a
white
apron
and
a
plain
hat
such
as
common
people
of
her
country
wore
illustration
of
this
inky
mixture
she
swallowed
two
teaspoonfuls
every
hour
for
six
when
these
preparations
had
been
made
zixi
slipped
out
the
back
door
of
the
palace
and
walked
through
the
city
to
the
forest
and
although
she
met
many
people
no
one
suspected
that
she
was
the
queen
it
was
rough
walking
in
the
forest
but
she
got
through
at
last
and
reached
the
bank
of
the
river
here
a
fisherman
was
found
who
consented
to
ferry
her
across
in
his
boat
and
afterward
zixi
climbed
the
high
mountain
and
came
down
the
other
side
into
the
kingdom
of
noland
she
rented
a
neat
little
cottage
just
at
the
north
gateway
of
the
city
of
nole
and
by
the
next
morning
there
was
a
sign
over
the
doorway
which
announced
miss
trust
s
academy
of
witchery
for
young
ladies
then
zixi
had
printed
on
green
paper
a
lot
of
handbills
which
read
as
follows
miss
trust
a
pupil
of
the
celebrated
professor
hatrack
of
is
now
located
at
woodbine
villa
north
gateway
of
nole
and
is
prepared
to
teach
the
young
ladies
of
this
city
the
of
according
to
the
most
modern
and
approved
methods
terms
moderate
references
required
these
handbills
she
hired
a
little
boy
to
carry
to
all
the
aristocratic
houses
in
nole
and
to
leave
one
on
each
several
were
left
on
the
different
of
the
palace
and
one
of
these
came
to
the
notice
of
princess
fluff
how
funny
she
exclaimed
on
reading
it
i
ll
go
and
take
all
my
eight
maids
with
me
it
will
be
no
end
of
fun
to
learn
to
be
a
many
other
people
in
nole
applied
for
instruction
in
miss
trust
s
academy
but
zixi
told
them
all
she
had
no
vacancies
when
however
fluff
and
her
maids
arrived
she
welcomed
them
with
the
utmost
cordiality
and
consented
to
give
them
their
first
lesson
at
once
when
she
had
seated
them
in
her
parlor
zixi
said
if
you
wish
to
be
a
witch
you
must
speak
an
incantation
you
must
with
deliberation
say
the
when
of
why
is
which
what
does
that
mean
asked
fluff
no
one
knows
answered
zixi
and
therefore
it
is
a
fine
incantation
now
all
the
class
will
please
repeat
after
me
the
following
words
they
tried
to
do
this
but
their
tongues
stumbled
constantly
over
the
syllables
and
one
of
the
maids
began
to
laugh
stop
laughing
please
cried
zixi
rapping
her
ruler
on
the
table
this
is
no
laughing
matter
i
assure
you
young
ladies
the
science
of
witchcraft
is
a
solemn
and
serious
study
and
i
can
not
teach
it
you
unless
you
but
what
s
it
all
about
asked
fluff
i
ll
explain
what
it
s
about
said
zixi
with
dignity
now
here
are
two
important
incantations
which
you
must
learn
by
heart
before
you
come
to
s
lesson
if
you
can
speak
them
correctly
and
rapidly
and
above
all
very
distinctly
i
will
then
allow
you
to
perform
a
wonderful
she
handed
them
each
a
slip
of
paper
on
which
were
written
the
incantations
as
follows
incantation
no
to
be
spoken
only
in
the
presence
of
a
black
cat
this
is
that
and
that
is
this
bliss
is
blest
and
blest
is
bliss
who
is
that
and
what
is
who
shed
is
shod
and
shud
is
shoe
incantation
no
to
be
spoken
when
the
clock
strikes
twelve
what
is
which
and
which
is
what
pat
is
pet
and
pit
is
pat
hid
is
hide
and
hod
is
hid
did
is
deed
and
done
is
did
now
there
is
one
thing
more
continued
zixi
and
this
is
very
important
you
must
each
wear
the
handsomest
and
most
splendid
cloak
you
can
secure
when
you
come
to
me
this
request
made
princess
fluff
thoughtful
all
the
way
home
for
she
at
once
remembered
her
magic
cloak
and
wondered
if
the
strange
miss
trust
knew
she
possessed
it
she
asked
bud
about
it
that
night
and
the
young
king
said
i
m
afraid
this
is
some
one
trying
to
get
hold
of
your
magic
cloak
i
would
advise
you
not
to
wear
it
when
she
is
around
or
more
than
likely
she
may
steal
illustration
now
there
is
one
thing
more
continued
zixi
and
this
is
very
so
fluff
did
not
wear
her
magic
cloak
the
next
day
but
selected
in
its
place
a
pretty
blue
cape
edged
with
gold
when
she
and
her
maids
reached
the
cottage
zixi
cried
out
angrily
that
is
not
your
handsomest
cloak
go
home
at
once
and
get
the
other
one
i
won
t
said
fluff
shortly
you
must
you
must
insisted
the
i
can
teach
you
nothing
unless
you
wear
the
other
how
did
you
know
i
had
another
cloak
asked
the
princess
suspiciously
by
witchcraft
perhaps
said
zixi
mildly
if
you
want
to
be
a
witch
you
must
wear
i
don
t
want
to
be
a
witch
declared
fluff
come
girls
come
let
s
go
home
at
implored
zixi
eagerly
if
you
ll
get
the
cloak
i
will
teach
you
the
most
wonderful
things
in
the
world
i
will
make
you
the
most
powerful
witch
that
ever
lived
i
don
t
believe
you
replied
fluff
and
then
she
marched
back
to
the
palace
with
all
her
maids
but
zixi
knew
her
plot
had
failed
so
she
locked
up
the
cottage
and
went
back
again
to
ix
climbing
the
mountain
and
crossing
the
river
and
threading
the
forest
with
angry
thoughts
and
harsh
words
illustration
that
is
not
your
handsomest
cloak
go
home
at
once
and
get
the
other
one
yet
the
queen
was
more
determined
than
ever
to
secure
the
magic
cloak
as
soon
as
she
had
reëntered
her
palace
and
by
more
incantations
had
again
transformed
her
hair
to
yellow
and
her
eyes
to
black
and
dressed
herself
in
her
royal
robes
she
summoned
her
generals
and
counselors
and
told
them
to
make
ready
to
war
upon
the
kingdom

than

she
decided
to

in

so
that

herself
could

through

making

to

he
came

by

to

he
told

the
lord
high
counselor
what
was
threatening

so
trembling
with
terror
tullydub
hastened
to
the
palace
and
called
a
meeting
of
the
five
high
counselors
in
the
king
s
antechamber
when
all
were
assembled
together
with
bud
and
fluff
the
old

told
his
news
and
cried
we
shall
all
be
slaughtered
and
our

sacked
and
destroyed
for
the

is
twice
as
big
as

what
of
that
said
tollydob
scornfully
have
they
a
general
as
tall
as
i
am
certainly
not
said
the
chief
counselor
who
ever
saw
a
man
as
tall
as
you
are
then
i
ll
fight
and
conquer
them
declared
tollydob
rising
and
walking
about
the
room
so
that
all
might
see
where
his
head
just
grazed
the
ceiling
but
you
can
t
general
you
can
t
fight
an
army
by
yourself
remonstrated
tullydub
excitedly
and
being
so
big
you
are
a
better
mark
for
their
arrows
and
at
this
the
general
sat
down
rather
suddenly
and
grew
pale
perhaps
we
can
buy
them
off
remarked
the
lord
high
jingling
the
purse
that
now
never
became
empty
no

exclaimed
princess

with
sudden
interest
what
does
she
look
like
but
all
shook
their
heads
at
the
question
and
tullydub
explained
none
of
us
has
ever
seen
her
for
we
have
never
been
friendly
with
the
people
of
ix
but
from
all

the

sat
down
suddenly
and
grew

it
s
the
one
who
wanted
to
teach
me
witchcraft
in
order
to
steal
my
magic
cloak
said
fluff
with
sudden
excitement
and
when
she
found
she
couldn
t
steal
it
she
went
back
after
her
what
magic
cloak
do
you
refer
to
asked
tullydub
why
the
one
the
fairies
gave
me
replied
fluff
is
it
of
gorgeous
colors
with
golden
threads
running
through
it
asked
the
lord
high
general
now
thoroughly
interested
yes
said
the
princess
the
very
and
what
peculiar
powers
does
it
possess
why
it
grants
its
wearer
the
fulfillment
of
one
wish
she
answered
all
the
high
counselors
regarded
her
earnestly
then
that
was
the
cloak
i
wore
when
i
wished
to
be
ten
feet
high
said
tollydob
and
i
wore
it
when
i
wished
i
could
reach
the
apple
said
tellydeb
and
i
wore
it
when
i
wished
that
my
dog
ruffles
could
speak

tallydab
and
i
wore
it

i
wished
the
royal
purse
would
always
remain
full

tillydib
i
did
not
know
that
remarked
fluff
thoughtfully
but
i
ll
never
forget
that
i
lent
it
to
aunt
rivette
and
that
was
the
time
she
wished

tullydub
inquired
eagerly
no

why

your

wish
that
your

asked
the

saving

wish
answered
bud
and
it
won
t
be
that
but
unless
something
is
done
we
shall
all
be
destroyed
protested
tullydub
then
wear
the
cloak
yourself
said
bud
you
haven
t
had
a
wish
good
cried
the
four
other
counselors
and
the
lord
high
general
added
that
will
surely
save
us
from
any
further
i
ll
fetch
the
cloak
at
once
said
fluff
and
she
ran
quickly
from
the
room
to
get
it
supposing
tullydub
remarked
hesitatingly
the
magic
power
shouldn
t
work
oh
but
it
will
answered
the
general
i
m
sure
it
will
said
the
steward
i
know
it
will
declared
the
it
can
not
fail
affirmed
the
executioner
remember
what
it
has
already
done
for
us
then
fluff
arrived
with
the
cloak
and
after
considering
carefully
how
he
would
speak
his
wish
the
lord
high
counselor
drew
the
cloak
over
his
shoulders
and
said
solemnly
i
wish
that
we
shall
be
able
to
defeat
our
enemies
and
drive
them
all
from

the

high
counselor
drew
the
cloak
over
his
didn
t
you
make
two
wishes
instead
of
one
asked
the
princess
anxiously
never
mind
said
the
general
if
we
defeat
them
it
will
be
easy
enough
to
drive
them
from
our
the
lord
high
counselor
removed
the
cloak
and
carefully
refolded
it
if
it
grants
my
wish
said
he
thoughtfully
it
will
indeed
be
lucky
for
our
country
that
the
princess
fluff
came
to
live
in
the
palace
of
the
the
queen
formed
her
men
into
a
line
of
battle
facing
the
army
of
nole
and
they
were
so
numerous
in
comparison
with
their
enemies
that
even
the
more
timorous
soldiers
gained
confidence
and
stood
up
straight
and
threw
out
their
chests
as
if
to
show
how
brave
they
were
then
queen
zixi
clad
in
her
flashing
mail
and
mounted
upon
her
magnificent
white
charger
rode
slowly
along
the
ranks
her
white
plume
nodding
gracefully
with
the
motion
of
the
horse
and
when
she
reached
the
center
of
the
line
she
halted
and
addressed
her
army
in
a
voice
that
sounded
clear
as
the
tones
of
a
bell
and
reached
to
every
listening
ear
soldiers
of
the
land
of
ix
she
began
we
are
about
to
engage
in
a
great
battle
for
conquest
and
glory
before
you
lies
the
rich
city
of
nole
and
when
you
have
defeated
yonder
army
and
gained
the
gates
you
may
divide
among
yourselves
all
the
plunder
of
gold
and
silver
and
jewels
and
precious
stones
that
the
place
hearing
this
a
great
shout
of
joy
arose
from
the
soldiers
which
zixi
quickly
silenced
with
a
wave
of
her
white
hand
for
myself
she
continued
i
desire
nothing
more
than
a
cloak
that
is
owned
by
the
princess
fluff
all
else
shall
be
given
to
my
brave
we
do
not
win
the
battle
asked
one
of
her
generals
anxiously
what
then
do
we
gain
nothing
but
disgrace
answered
the
queen
haughtily
but
how
can
we
fail
to
win

myself

the
assault

zixi
of
ix
has
fought
a
hundred
battles
and
never
yet
met
with
defeat
there
was
more
cheering
at
this
for
zixi
s
words
were
quite
true
nevertheless
her
soldiers
did
not
like
the
look
of
that
silent
army
of
nole
standing
so
steadfastly
before
the
gates
and
facing
the
invaders
with
calm
determination
zixi
herself
was
somewhat
disturbed
at
this
sight
for
she
could
not
guess
what
powers
the
magic
cloak
had
given
to
the
nolanders
but
in
a
loud
and
undaunted
voice
she
shouted
the
command
to
advance
and
while
trumpets
blared
and
drums
rolled
the
great
army
of
ix
awoke
to
action
and
marched
steadily
upon
the
men
of
nole
bud
who
could
not
bear
to
remain
shut
up
in
his
palace
while
all
this
excitement
was
occurring
outside
the
city
gates
had
slipped
away
from
fluff
and
joined
his
gigantic
general
tollydob
he
was
of
course
unused
to
war
and
when
he
beheld
the
vast
array
of
zixi
s
army
he
grew
fearful
that
the
magic
cloak
might
not
be
able
to
save
his
city
from
conquest
yet
the
five
high
counselors
who
were
all
present
seemed
not
to
worry
the
least
bit
they
re
very
pretty
soldiers

look
at

the

with

was
succeeded
by
a
frown

i
can
never
resist
admiring
a
fine

he
fights

was

beside

the
men
bewildered
and
terrified
were
deaf
to
her
appeals

fled
swiftly
back
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
and
concealed
themselves
in
the
wooded
valley
until
the
sun
set
and
it
was

into

night

queen

succeeded
in
restoring

the
rout
of
the
army
of

the
next
day
was
a
busy
one
in
the
city
of

the
lord
high
general
marched
his
seven
thousand
seven
hundred
and
men
out
of
the
city
gates
and
formed
them
in
line
of
battle
on
the
brow
of
a
hill
then
he
asked
aunt
rivette
to
fly
over
the
top
of
the
mountain
and
see
where
the
enemy
was
located
the
old
woman
gladly
undertook
the
mission
she
had
by
this
time
become
an
expert
flier
and
being
proud
to
resemble
a
bird
she
dressed
herself
in
flowing
robes
of
as
many
colors
as
a
could
boast
when
she
mounted
into
the
air
streamers
of
green
and
yellow
silk
floated
behind
her
in
quite
a
beautiful
and
interesting
fashion
and
she
was
admired
by
all
beholders
aunt
rivette
flew
high
above
the
and
there
she
saw
the
great
army
of
queen
zixi
climbing
up
the
slope
on
the
other
side
the
army
also
saw
her
and
stopped
short
in
amazement
at
seeing
a
woman
fly
like
a
bird
they
had
before
this
thought
their
queen
sure
of
victory
because
she
was
a
witch
and
possessed
many
wonderful
arts
but
now
they
saw
that
the
people
of
noland
could
also
do
wonderful
things
and
it
speedily
disheartened
them
zixi
ordered
them
to
shoot
a
thousand
arrows
at
aunt
rivette
but
quickly
countermanded
the
order
as
the
old
woman
was
too
high
to
be
injured
and
the
arrows
would
have
been
wasted
when
the
army
of
ix
had
climbed
the
mountain
and
was
marching
down
again
toward
nole
the
lord
high
steward
sent
his
dog
ruffles
to
them
to
make
more
mischief
ruffles
trotted
soberly
among
the
soldiers
of
ix
and
once
in
a
while
he
would
pause
and
say
in
a
loud
voice
the
army
of
noland
will
conquer
then
all
the
soldiers
would
look
around
to
see
who
had
spoken
these
fearful
words
but
could
see
nothing
but
a
little
dog
and
ruffles
would
pretend
to
be
scratching
his
nose
with
his
left
hind
foot
and
would
look
so
innocent
that
they
never
for
a

suspected

could
speak

the
soldiers
and
they
would
have
fled
even
then
had
not
queen
zixi
called
them
cowards
and
stubbornly
declared
that
they
only
fancied
they
had
heard
the
voices
speak
some
of
them
believed
her
and
some
did
not
but
they
decided
to
remain
and
fight
since
they
had
come
so
far
to
do
so
then
they
formed
in
line
of
battle
again
and
marched
boldly
toward
the
army
of
noland
while
they
were
still
a
good
way
off
and
the
generals
were
riding
in
front
of
their
soldiers
the
lord
high
executioner
suddenly
stretched
out
his
long
arm
and
pulled
another
general
of
ix
from
his
horse
as
he
had
done
the
day
before
dragging
him
swiftly
over
the
ground
between
the
opposing
armies
until
he
was
seized
by
the
men
of
nole
and
tightly
bound
with
cords
the
soldiers
of

uttered
murmurs
of
horror
at
this
sight
and
stopped
again
immediately
the
long
arm
shot
out
and
pulled
another
general
from
their
ranks
and
made
him
prisoner
queen
zixi
raved
and
stormed
with
anger
but
the
lord
high
executioner
who
was
enjoying
himself
immensely
continued
to
grab
officer
after
officer
and
make
them
prisoners
and
so
far
there
had
been
no
sign
of
battle
not
an
arrow
had
been
fired
nor
an
ax
swung
then
to
complete
the
amazement
of
the
enemy
the
gigantic
general
of
the
army

stepped
in
front
of
his
men
and
waved
around
his
head
a
flashing
sword
six
feet
in
length
while
he
shouted
in
a
voice
like
a
roar

and
down

chapter

the
theft
of
the
magic
cloak
when
the
soldiers
of
queen
zixi
ran
away
they
fled
in
so
many
different
directions
that
the
bewildered
queen
could
not
keep
track
of
them
her
horse
taking
fright
dashed
up
the
and
tossed

into
a
after
which
he
ran
off
and
left
her
one
would
think
such
a
chain
of
misfortunes
could
not
fail
to
daunt
the
bravest
but
zixi
had
lived
too
many
years
to
allow
such
trifles
as
defeat
and
flight
to
ruin
her
nerves
so
she
calmly
disentangled
herself
from
the
and
looked
around
to
see
where
she
was
it
was
very
quiet
and
peaceful
on
this
part
of
the
her
glittering
army
had
disappeared
to
the
last
man
in
the
far
distance
she
could
see
the
spires
and
turreted
palaces
of
the
city
of
nole
and
behind
her
was
a
thick
grove
of
bearing
flowers
in
full
bloom
this
gave
zixi
an
idea
she
pushed
aside
some
of
the
branches
and
entered
the
cool
shadowy
avenues
between
the
trees
the
air
was
heavy
with
the
scent
of
the
violet
flowers
and
tiny
were
darting
here
and
there
to
thrust
their
long
bills
into
the
blossoms
and
draw
out
the
honey
for
food
butterflies
there
were
too
and
a
few
chipmunks
perched
high
among
the
branches
but
zixi
walked
on
through
the
trees
in
deep
thought
and
presently
she
had
laid
new
plans
for
since
the
magic
cloak
was
so
hard
to
get
she
wanted
it
more
than
ever
by
and
by
she
gathered
some
bits
of
the
and
dug
some
roots
from
the
ground
next
she
caught
six
spotted
butterflies
from
the
wings
of
which
she
brushed
off
all
the
round
purple
spots
then
she
wandered
on
until
she
came
upon
a
little
spring
of
water
bubbling
from
the
ground
and
filling
a
leaf
of
the
from
the
spring
she
mixed
her
bark
and
roots
and
butterfly
spots
in
the
liquid
and
boiled
it
carefully
over
a
fire
of
twigs
for
will
not
burn
so
long
as
there
is
water
inside
them
when
her
magical
compound
was
ready
zixi
muttered
an
incantation
and
drank
it
in
a
single
draught
a
few
moments
later
the
had
disappeared
and
in
her
place
stood
the
likeness
of
a
pretty
young
girl
dressed
in
a
simple
white
gown
with
pink
ribbons
at
the
shoulders
and
a
pink
sash
around
her
waist
her
hair
was
gathered
into
two
long
braids
that
hung
down
her
back
and
she
had
two
big
blue
eyes
that
looked
very
innocent
and
sweet
besides
these
changes
both
the
nose
and
the
mouth
of
the
girl
differed
in
shape
from
those
of
zixi
so
that
no
one
would
have
seen
the
slightest
resemblance
between
the
two
people
or
between
miss
trust
and
the
girl
who
stood
in
the
the
transformed
gave
a
sweet
rippling
laugh
and
glanced
at
her
reflection
in
the
still
waters
of
the
spring
and
then
the
girlish
face
frowned
for
the
image
glaring
up
at
her
was
that
of
a
wrinkled
toothless
old
hag
i
really
must
have
that
cloak
sighed
the
girl
and
then
she
turned
and
walked
out
of
the
and
down
the
toward
the
city
of
nole
the
princess
fluff
was
playing
tennis
with
her
maids
in
a
courtyard
of
the
royal
palace
when
jikki
came
to
say
that
a
girl
wished
to
speak
with
her
highness
send
her
here
said
fluff
so
the
came
to
her
in
the
guise
of
the
fair
young
girl
and
bowing
in
a
humble
manner
before
the
princess
she
said
please
your
highness
may
i
be
one
of
your
maids
why
i
have
eight
already
answered
fluff
laughing
but
my
father
and
mother
are
both
dead
and
i
have
come
all
the
way
from
my
castle
to
beg
you
to
let
me
wait
upon
you
said
the
girl
looking
at
the
little
princess
with
a
pleading
expression
in
her
blue
eyes
who
are
you
asked
fluff
i
am
daughter
of
the
lord
hurrydole
and
my
name
is
adlena
replied
the
girl
which
was
not
altogether
a
falsehood
because
one
of
her
ancestors
had
borne
the
name
hurrydole
and
adlena
was
one
of
her
own
names
then
adlena
said
fluff
brightly
you
shall
certainly
be
one
of
my
maids
for
there
is
plenty
of
room
in
the
palace
and
the
more
girls
i
have
around
me
the
happier
i
shall
so
queen
zixi
under
the
name
of
adlena
became
an
inmate
of
the
king
s
palace
and
it
was
not
many
days
before
she
learned
where
the
magic
cloak
was
kept
for
the
princess
gave
her
a
key
to
a
drawer
and
told
her
to
get
from
it
a
blue
silk
scarf
she
wished
to
wear
and
directly
under
the
scarf
lay
the
fairy
garment
adlena
would
have
seized
it
at
that
moment
had
she
dared
but
fluff
was
in
the
same
room
so
she
only
said
please
princess
may
i
look
at
that
pretty
cloak
of
course
answered
fluff
but
handle
it
carefully
for
it
was
given
me
by
the
so
adlena
unfolded
the
cloak
and
looked
at
it
very
carefully
noting
exactly
the
manner
in
which
it
was
woven
then
she
folded
it
again
arranged
it
in
the
drawer
and
turned
the
key
which
the
princess
immediately
attached
to
a
chain
which
she
always
wore
around
her
neck
that
night
when
the
was
safely
locked
in
her
own
room
and
could
not
be
disturbed
she
called
about
her
a
great
many
of
those
invisible
imps
that
serve
the
most
skilful
witches
commanding
them
to
weave
for
her
a
cloak
in
the
exact
likeness
of
the
one
given
princess
fluff
by
the
fairies
of
course
the
imps
had
never
seen
the
magic
cloak
but
zixi
described
it
to
them
accurately
and
before
morning
they
had
woven
a
garment
so
closely
resembling
the
original
that
the
imitation
was
likely
to
deceive
any
one
only
one
thing
was
missing
and
that
was
the
golden
thread
woven
by
queen
lulea
herself
and
which
gave
the
cloak
its
magic
powers
of
course
the
imps
of
zixi
could
not
get
this
golden
thread
nor
could
they
give
any
magical
properties
to
the
garment
they
had
made
at
the
witch
s
command
but
they
managed
to
give
the
cloak
all
of
the
many
brilliant
colors
of
the
original
and
zixi
was
quite
satisfied
the
next
day
adlena
wore
this
cloak
while
she
walked
in
the
garden
very
soon
princess
fluff
saw
her
and
ran
after
the
girl
crying
indignantly
see
here
what
do
you
mean
by
wearing
my
cloak
take
it
off
instantly
illustration
which
is
mine
she
finally
asked
in
a
startled
it
isn
t
your
cloak
it
is
one
of
my
own
replied
the
girl
calmly
nonsense
there
can
t
be
two
such
cloaks
in
the
world
retorted
fluff
but
there
are
persisted
adlena
how
could
i
get
the
one
in
your
drawer
when
the
key
is
around
your
own
neck
i
m
not
sure
i
don
t
know
admitted
the
princess
beginning
to
be
puzzled
but
come
with
me
into
my
rooms
if
my
fairy
cloak
is
indeed
in
the
drawer
then
i
will
believe
so
they
went
to
the
drawer
and
of
course
found
the
magic
cloak
as
the
cunning
zixi
had
planned
fluff
pulled
it
out
and
held
the
two
up
together
to
compare
them
and
they
seemed
to
be
exactly
alike
i
think
yours
is
a
little
the
longer
said
adlena
and
threw
it
over
the
shoulders
of
the
princess
no
i
think
mine
is
the
longer
she
continued
and
removing
the
magic
cloak
put
her
own
upon
fluff
they
seemed
to
be
about
the
same
length
but
adlena
kept
putting
first
one
and
then
the
other
upon
the
princess
until
they
were
completely
mixed
and
the
child
could
not
have
told
one
from
the
other
which
is
mine
she
finally
asked
in
a
startled
voice
this
of
course
answered
adlena
folding
up
the
imitation
cloak
which
the
imps
had
made
and
putting
it
away
in
the
drawer
fluff
never
suspected
the
trick
so
zixi
carried
away
the
magic
cloak
she
had
thus
cleverly
stolen
and
she
was
so
delighted
with
the
success
of
her
stratagem
that
she
could
have
screamed
aloud
for
pure
joy
as
soon
as
she
was
alone
and
unobserved
the
slipped
out
of
the
palace
and
carrying
the
magic
cloak
in
a
bundle
under
her
arm
ran
down
the
streets
of
nole
and
out
through
the
gate
in
the
wall
and
away
toward
the
mountain
where
the
lay
at
last
she
kept
saying
to
herself
at
last
i
shall
see
my
own
beautiful
reflection
in
a
mirror
instead
of
that
horrid
old
hag
when
she
was
safe
in
the
grove
she
succeeded
by
means
of
her
witchcraft
in
transforming
the
girl
adlena
back
into
the
beautiful
woman
known
throughout
the
kingdom
of
ix
as
queen
zixi
and
then
she
lost
no
time
in
throwing
the
magic
cloak
over
her
shoulders
i
wish
she
cried
in
a
loud
voice
that
my
reflection
in
every
mirror
will
hereafter
show
the
same
face
and
form
as
that
in
which
i
appear
to
exist
in
the
sight
of
all
mortals
then
she
threw
off
the
cloak
and
ran
to
the
crystal
spring
saying
now
indeed
i
shall
at
last
see
the
lovely
queen
zixi
but
as
she
bent
over
the
spring
she
gave
a
sudden
shriek
of
disappointed
rage
for
glaring
up
at
her
from
the
glassy
surface
of
the
water
was
the
same
fearful
hag
she
had
always
seen
as
the
reflection
of
her
likeness
the
magic
cloak
would
grant
no
wish
to
a
person
who
had
stolen
it
zixi
more
wretched
than
she
had
ever
been
before
in
her
life
threw
herself
down
upon
her
face
in
the
and
wept
for
more
than
an
hour
which
is
an
exceedingly
long
time
for
tears
to
run
from
one
s
eyes
and
when
she
finally
arose
two
tiny
brooks
flowed
from
the
spot
and
wound
through
the
to
the
right
and
one
to
the
left
then
leaving
the
magic
possess
which
she
had
struggled
so
hard
and
unheeded
upon
the
ground
the
disappointed
walked
slowly
away
and
finally
reached
the
bank
of
the
great
river
illustration
she
threw
off
the
cloak
and
ran
to
the
crystal
here
she
found
a
rugged
old
alligator
who
lay
upon
the
bank
weeping
with
such
bitterness
that
the
sight
reminded
zixi
of
her
own
recent
outburst
of
sorrow
why
do
you
weep
friend
she
asked
for
her
experience
as
a
witch
had
long
since
taught
her
the
language
of
the
beasts
and
birds
and
reptiles
because
i
can
not
climb
a
tree
answered
the
alligator
but
why
do
you
wish
to
climb
a
tree
she
questioned
surprised
because
i
can
t
returned
the
alligator
squeezing
two
more
tears
from
his
eyes
but
that
is
very
foolish
exclaimed
the
scornfully
oh
i
don
t
know
said
the
alligator
it
doesn
t
strike
me
that
it
s
much
more
foolish
than
the
fancies
some
other
people
perhaps
not
replied
zixi
more
gently
and
walked
away
in
deep
thought
while
she
followed
the
to
find
a
ferry
across
the
dusk
fell
and
presently
a
gray
owl
came
out
of
a
hollow
in
a
tall
tree
and
sat
upon
a
limb
wailing
dismally
zixi
stopped
and
looked
at
the
bird
why
do
you
wail
so
loudly
she
asked
illustration
because
i
can
not
climb
a
tree
answered
the
because
i
can
not
swim
in
the
river
like
a
fish
answered
the
owl
and
it
screeched
so
sadly
that
it
made
the
queen
shiver
why
do
you
wish
to
swim
she
inquired
because
i
can
t
said
the
owl
and
buried
its
head
under
its
wing
with
a
groan
but
that
is
absurd
cried
zixi
with
impatience
the
owl
had
an
ear
out
and
heard
her
so
it
withdrew
its
head
long
enough
to
retort
i
don
t
think
it
s
any
more
absurd
than
the
longings
of
some
other
perhaps
you
are
right
said
the
queen
and
hung
her
head
as
she
walked
on
by
and
by
she
found
a
ferryman
with
a
boat
and
he
agreed
to
row
her
across
the
river
in
one
end
of
the
boat
crouched
a
little
girl
the
ferryman
s
daughter
and
she
sobbed
continually
so
that
the
sound
of
the
child
s
grief
finally
attracted
zixi
s
attention
why
do
you
sob
questioned
the
queen
because
i
want
to
be
a
man
replied
the
child
trying
to
stifle
her
sobs
why
do
you
want
to
be
a
man
asked
zixi
curiously
because
i
m
a
little
girl
was
the
reply
this
made
zixi
angry
you
re
a
little
fool
she
exclaimed
loudly
there
are
other
fools
in
the
world
said
the
child
and
renewed
her
sobs
illustration
why
do
you
sob
questioned
the
zixi
did
not
reply
but
she
thought
to
herself
we
are
all
alligator
the
owl
the
girl
and
the
powerful
queen
of
ix
we
long
for
what
we
can
not
have
yet
desire
it
not
so
much
because
it
would
benefit
us
as
because
it
is
beyond
our
reach
if
i
call
the
others
fools
i
must
also
call
myself
a
fool
for
wishing
to
see
the
reflection
of
a
beautiful
girl
in
my
mirror
when
i
know
it
is
impossible
so
hereafter
i
shall
strive
to
be
contented
with
my
this
was
a
wise
resolution
and
the
abided
by
it
for
many
years
she
was
not
very
bad
this
zixi
for
it
must
be
admitted
that
few
have
the
courage
to
acknowledge
their
faults
and
strive
to
correct
them
as
she
did
chapter
xvi
the
plain
above
the
clouds
i
have
already
mentioned
how
high
the
mountains
were
between
noland
and
the
land
of
ix
but
at
the
north
of
the
city
of
nole
were
mountains
much
high
indeed
that
they
seemed
to
pierce
the
clouds
and
it
was
said
the
moon
often
stopped
on
the
highest
peak
to
rest
it
was
not
one
single
slope
up
from
the
lowlands
but
first
there
was
a
high
mountain
with
a
level
plain
at
the
top
and
then
another
high
mountain
rising
from
the
level
and
capped
with
a
second
plain
and
then
another
mountain
and
so
on
which
made
them
somewhat
resemble
a
pair
of
stairs
so
that
the
people
of
nole
who
looked
upon
the
north
mountains
with
much
pride
used
to
point
them
out
as
the
giant
s
stairway
forgetting
that
no
giant
was
ever
big
enough
to
use
such
an
immense
flight
of
stairs
many
people
had
climbed
the
first
mountain
and
upon
the
plain
at
its
top
flocks
of
sheep
were
fed
and
two
or
three
people
boasted
they
had
climbed
the
second
steep
but
beyond
that
the
mountains
were
all
unknown
to
the
dwellers
in
the
valley
of
noland
as
a
matter
of
fact
no
one
lived
upon
them
they
were
inhabited
only
by
a
few
small
animals
and
an
occasional
vulture
or
eagle
which
nested
in
some
rugged
crag
but
at
the
top
of
all
was
an
enormous
plain
that
lay
far
above
the
clouds
and
here
the
dwelt
in
great
numbers
i
must
describe
these
to
you
for
they
were
unlike
any
other
people
in
all
the
world
their
bodies
were
as
round
as
a
you
can
imagine
a
ball
fully
four
feet
in
thickness
at
the
middle
and
their
muscles
were
as
tough
and
elastic
as
they
had
heads
and
arms
resembling
our
own
and
very
short
legs
and
all
these
they
could
withdraw
into
their
bodies
whenever
they
wished
very
much
as
a
turtle
withdraws
its
legs
and
head
into
its
shell
the
lived
all
by
themselves
in
their
country
among
the
clouds
and
there
were
thousands
and
thousands
of
them
they
were
quarrelsome
by
nature
but
could
seldom
hurt
one
another
because
if
they
fought
they
would
withdraw
their
arms
and
legs
and
heads
into
their
bodies
and
roll
themselves
at
one
another
with
much
fierceness
but
when
they
collided
they
would
bounce
apart
again
and
little
harm
was
done
in
spite
of
their
savage
dispositions
the
had
as
yet
done
no
harm
to
any
one
but
themselves
as
they
lived
so
high
above
the
world
that
other
people
knew
nothing
of
their
existence
nor
did
they
themselves
know
because
of
the
clouds
that
floated
between
of
the
valleys
which
lay
below
them
but
as
ill
luck
would
have
it
a
few
days
after
king
bud
s
army
had
defeated
the
army
of
ix
one
of
the
while
fighting
with
another
rolled
too
near
the
edge
of
the
plain
whereon
they
dwelt
and
bounded
down
the
that
faced
noland
wind
had
scattered
the
clouds
so
his
fellows
immediately
rolled
themselves
to
the
edge
and
watched
the
luckless
fly
down
the
mountain
bounce
across
the
plain
and
thence
speed
down
the
next
mountain
by
and
by
he
became
a
dot
to
their
eyes
and
then
a
mere
speck
but
as
the
clouds
had
just
rolled
away
for
a
few
moments
the
could
see
by
straining
their
eyes
the
city
of
nole
lying
in
the
valley
far
below
it
seemed
from
that
distance
merely
a
toy
city
but
they
knew
it
must
be
a
big
place
to
show
so
far
away
and
since
they
had
no
cities
of
their
own
they
became
curious
to
visit
the
one
they
had
just
discovered
the
ruler
of
the
who
was
more
quarrelsome
than
any
of
the
rest
had
a
talk
with
his
chief
men
about
visiting
the
unknown
city
we
can
roll
down
the
mountain
just
as
our
brother
did
he
argued
but
how
in
the
world
could
we
ever
get
back
again
said
one
of
the
chiefs
sticking
his
head
up
to
look
with
astonishment
at
the
ruler
we
don
t
want
to
get
back
said
the
other
excitedly
some
one
has
built
many
houses
and
palaces
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
and
we
can
live
in
those
if
they
are
big
enough
and
if
there
are
enough
of
illustration
all
the
hundreds
and
thousands
of
that
were
in
existence
assembled
upon
the
edge
of
their
plain
and
at
the
word
of
their
ruler
hurled
themselves
down
the
mountain
with
terrible
cries
and
went
bounding
away
toward
the
peaceful
city
of
perhaps
the
people
won
t
let
us
suggested
another
chief
who
was
not
in
favor
of
the
expedition
we
will
fight
them
and
destroy
them
retorted
the
ruler
scowling
at
the
chief
as
if
he
would
make
him
ashamed
of
his
cowardice
then
we
must
all
go
together
said
a
third
chief
for
if
only
a
few
go
we
may
find
ourselves
many
times
outnumbered
and
at
last
be
every
in
the
country
shall
go
declared
the
ruler
who
brooked
no
opposition
when
once
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
a
thing
on
the
plain
grew
a
grove
of
big
bearing
thorns
as
long
and
sharp
as
swords
so
the
ruler
commanded
each
of
his
people
to
cut
two
of
the
thorns
one
for
each
hand
with
which
to
attack
whatever
foes
they
might
meet
when
they
reached
the
unknown
valley
then
on
a
certain
day
all
the
hundreds
and
thousands
of
that
were
in
existence
assembled
upon
the
edge
of
their
plain
and
at
the
word
of
their
ruler
hurled
themselves
down
the
mountain
with
terrible
cries
and
went
bounding
away
toward
the
peaceful
city

the
descent

the
king

and
princess
fluff
were
leading
very
happy
and
peaceful
lives
in
their
beautiful
palace
all
wars
and
dangers
seemed
at
an
end
and
there
was
nothing
to
disturb
their
content
all
the
gold
that
was
needed
the
royal
was
able
to
supply
from
his
overflowing
purse
the
gigantic
general
tollydob
became
famous
throughout
the
world
and
no
nation
dared
attack
the
army
of
noland
the
talking
dog
of
old
tallydab
made
every
one
wonder
and
people
came
many
miles
to
see
ruffles
and
hear
him
speak
it
was
said
that
all
this
good
fortune
had
been
brought
to
noland
by
the
pretty
princess
fluff
who
was
a
favorite
of
the
fairies
and
the
people
loved
her
on
this
account
as
well
as
for
her
bright
and
sunny
disposition
illustration
the
great
ball
struck
the
field
near
king
bud
caused
his
subjects
some
little
anxiety
to
be
sure
for
they
never
could
tell
what
he
was
liable
to
do
next
except
that
he
was
sure
to
do
something
unexpected
but
much
is
forgiven
a
king
and
if
bud
made
some
pompous
old
nobleman
stand
on
his
head
to
amuse
a
mob
of
people
he
would
give
him
a
good
dinner
afterward
and
fill
his
purse
with
gold
to
make
up
for
the
indignity
fluff
often
reproved
her
brother
for
such
pranks
but
bud
s
soul
was
flooded
with
mischief
and
it
was
hard
for
him
to
resist
letting
a
little
of
the
surplus
escape
now
and
then
after
all
the
people
were
fairly
content
and
prosperous
and
no
one
was
at
all
prepared
for
the
disasters
soon
to
overtake
them
one
day
while
king
bud
was
playing
at
ball
with
some
of
his
courtiers
on
a
field
outside
the
city
gates
the
first
warning
of
trouble
reached
him
bud
had
batted
a
ball
high
into
the
air
and
while
looking
upward
for
it
to
descend
he
saw
another
ball
bound
from
the
plain
at
the
top
of
the
north
mountains
fly
into
the
air
and
then
sink
gradually
toward
him
as
it
approached
it
grew
bigger
and
bigger
until
it
assumed
mammoth
proportions
and
then
while
the
courtiers
screamed
in
terror
the
great
ball
struck
the
field
near
them
bounced
high
into
the
air
and
came
down
directly
upon
the
sharp
point
of
one
of
the
palace
towers
where
it
stuck
fast
with
a
yell
that
sounded
almost
human
for
some
moments
bud
and
his
companions
were
motionless
through
surprise
and
fear
then
they
rushed
into
the
city
and
stood
among
the
crowd
of
people
which
had
congregated
at
the
foot
of
the
tower
to
stare
at
the
big
ball
impaled
upon
its
point
once
in
a
while
two
arms
two
short
legs
and
a
head
would
dart
out
from
the
ball
and
wiggle
frantically
and
then
the
yell
would
be
repeated
and
the
head
and
limbs
withdrawn
swiftly
into
the
ball
it
was
all
so
curious
that
the
people
were
justified
in
staring
at
it
in
amazement
for
certainly
no
one
had
ever
seen
or
heard
of
a
before
or
even
known
such
a
creature
existed
finally
as
no
one
else
could
reach
the
aunt
rivette
flew
into
the
air
and
circled
slowly
around
the
ball
when
next
its
head
was
thrust
out
she
called
are
you
a
or
a
man
i
ll
show
you
which
if
i
get
hold
of
you
answered
the
fiercely
where
did
you
come
from
asked
aunt
rivette
taking
care
the
wiggling
arms
did
not
grab
her
illustration
where
did
you
come
from
asked
aunt
that

none
of
your
business
said
the
rolyrogue
but
i
didn
t
intend
to
come
that
you
may
depend
are
you
hurt
she
inquired
seeing
that
the
struggles
of
the
creature
made
him
spin
around
upon
the
like
a
windmill
no
i
m
not
hurt
at
all
declared
the
but
i
d
like
to
know
how

you
do
if
we
helped
you
to
get
free
asked
aunt
rivette
i
d
fight
every
one
of
those
idiots
who
are
laughing
at
me
down
there
said
the
creature
its
eyes
flashing
wickedly
then
you
d
best
stay
where
you
are
returned

who
flew
back
to
earth
again
to
tell
bud
what
the

believe
that

best
place
for
him
said
bud
so
we
ll
let
him
stay
where
he
is
he
s
not
very
ornamental
i
must
say
but
he
s
very
safe
up
there
on
top
of
the
we
might
have
him
gilded

old
woman
and
then
he
d
look
i
ll
think
it
over
said
the
king
and
he
went
away
to
finish
his
ball
game
the
people
talked
and
wondered
about
the
queer
creature
on
the
steeple
but
no
one
could
say
where
it
came
from
or
what
it
was
they
were
naturally
much
puzzled
the
next
day
was
bright
with
sunshine
so
early
in
the
forenoon
bud
and
fluff
had
the
royal
cook
fill
their
baskets
with
good
things
to
eat
and
set
out
to
picnic
on
the
bank
of
the
river
that
separated
noland
from
the
kingdom
of
ix
they
rode
ponies
to
reach
the
river
sooner
than
by
walking
and
their
only
companions
were
tallydab
the
lord
high
steward
and
his
talking
dog
ruffles
it
was
after
this
picnic
party
had
passed
over
the
mountain
and
were
securely
hidden
from
any
one
in
the
city
of
nole
that
the
ruler
of
the
and
his
thousands
of
followers
hurled
themselves
down
from
their
land
above
the
clouds
and
began
bounding
toward
the
plain
below
the
people
first
heard
a
roar
that
sounded
like
distant
thunder
and
when
they
looked
toward
the
north
mountains
they
saw
the
air
black
with
tiny
bouncing
balls
that
seemed
to
drop
from
the
drifting
clouds
which
always
had
obscured
the
highest
peak
but
although
appearing
small
when
first
seen
these
balls
grew
rapidly
larger
as
they
came
nearer
and
then
with
sharp
reports
like
they
began
dropping
upon
the
plain
by
dozens
and
hundreds
and
then
thousands
as
soon
as
they
touched
the
ground
they
bounded
upward
again
like
rubber
balls
the
children
throw
upon
the
floor
but
each
bound
was
less
violent
than
the
one
preceding
it
until
finally
within
the
streets
of
the
city
and
upon
all
the
fields
surrounding
it
lay
the
thousands
of
that
had
fallen
from
the
at
first
they
lay
still
as
if
stunned
by
their
swift
journey
and
collision
with
the
hard
earth
but
after
a
few
seconds
they
recovered
thrust
out
their
heads
and
limbs
and
scrambled
upon
their
flat
feet
then
the
savage
uttered
hoarse
shouts
of
joy
for
they
were
safely
arrived
at
the
city
they
had
seen
from
afar
and
the
audacious
adventure
was
a
success
chapter
xviii
the
conquest
of
noland
it
would
be
impossible
to
describe
the
amazement
of
the
people
of
nole
when
the
came
upon
them
not
only
was
the
descent
wholly
unexpected
but
the
appearance
of
the
invaders
was
queer
enough
to
strike
terror
to
the
stoutest
heart
their
round
bodies
were
supported
by
short
strong
legs
having
broad
flattened
feet
to
keep
them
steady
their
arms
were
short
and
the
fingers
of
their
hands
while
not
long
were
very
powerful
but
the
heads
were
the
most
startling
portions
of
these
strange
creatures
they
were
flat
and
thick
on
the
top
with
leathery
rolls
around
their
necks
so
that
when
the
head
was
drawn
in
its
upper
part
rounded
out
the
surface
of
the
ball
in
this
peculiar
head
the
had
two
big
eyes
as
shiny
as
porcelain
a
small
stubby
nose
and
a
huge
mouth
their
strange
clothing
fitted
their
bodies
closely
and
was
of
different
yellow
red
and
brown
taken
altogether
the
were
not
pretty
to
look
at
and
although
their
big
eyes
gave
them
a
startled
or
astonished
expression
nothing
seemed
ever
to
startle
or
astonish
them
in
the
least
when
they
arrived
in
the
valley
of
nole
after
their
wonderful
journey
down
the
mountains
they
scrambled
to
their
feet
extended
their
long
arms
with
the
thorns
clasped
tight
in
their
fingers
and
rushed
in
a
furious
crowd
and
with
loud
cries
upon
the
people
the
soldiers
of
tollydob
s
brave
army
had
not
even
time
to
seize
their
weapons
for
such
a
foe
coming
upon
them
through
the
air
had
never
been
dreamed
of
and
the
men
of
nole
who
might
have
resisted
the
enemy
were
too
much
frightened
to
do
more
than
tremble
violently
and
gasp
with
open
mouths
as
for
the
women
and
children
they
fled
screaming
into
the
houses
and
bolted
or
locked
the
doors
which
was
doubtless
the
wisest
thing
they
could
have
done
illustration
as
for
the
women
and
children
they
fled
screaming
into
the
general
tollydob
was
asleep
when
the
calamity
of
this
invasion
occurred
but
hearing
the
shouts
he
ran
out
of
his
mansion
and
met
several
of
the
face
to
face
without
hesitation
the
brave
general
rushed
upon
them
but
two
of
the
creatures
promptly
rolled
themselves
against
him
from
opposite
directions
so
that
the
giant
was
crushed
between
them
until
there
was
not
a
particle
of
breath
left
in
his
body
no
sooner
did
these
release
him
than
two
other
rolled
toward
him
but
tollydob
was
not
to
be
caught
twice
so
he
gave
a
mighty
jump
and
jumped
right
over
their
heads
with
the
result
that
the
balls
crashed
against
each
other
this
made
the
two
so
angry
that
they
began
to
fight
each
other
savagely
and
the
general
started
to
run
away
but
other
foes
rolled
after
him
knocked
him
down
and
stuck
their
thorns
into
him
until
he
yelled
for
mercy
and
promised
to
become
their
slave
tullydub
the
chief
counselor
watched
all
this
from
his
window
and
it
frightened
him
so
greatly
that
he
crawled
under
his
bed
and
hid
hoping
the
creatures
would
not
find
him
but
their
big
round
eyes
were
sharp
at
discovering
things
so
the
had
not
been
in
tullydub
s
room
two
minutes
before
he
was
dragged
from
beneath
his
bed
and
prodded
with
thorns
until
he
promised
obedience
to
the
conquerors
the
lord
high
at
the
first
alarm
dug
a
hole
in
the
garden
of
the
royal
palace
and
buried
his
purse
so
no
one
could
find
it
but
himself
but
he
might
have
saved
himself
this
trouble
for
the
knew
nothing
of
money
or
its
uses
being
accustomed
to
seizing
whatever
they
desired
without
a
thought
of
rendering
payment
for
it
having
buried
his
purse
old
tillydib
gave
himself
up
to
the
invaders
as
their
prisoner
and
this
saved
him
the
indignity
of
being
conquered
illustration
other
foes
rolled
after
him
and
knocked
him
the
lord
high
executioner
may
really
be
credited
with
making
the
only
serious
fight
of
the
day
for
when
the
came
upon
him
tellydeb
seized
his
ax
and
before
the
enemy
could
come
near
he
reached
out
his
long
arm
and
cleverly
sliced
the
heads
off
several
of
their
round
bodies
the
others
paused
for
a
moment
being
unused
to
such
warfare
and
not
understanding
how
an
arm
could
reach
so
far
but
seeing
their
heads
were
in
danger
about
a
hundred
of
the
creatures
formed
themselves
into
balls
and
rolled
upon
the
executioner
in
a
straight
line
hoping
to
crush
him
they
could
not
see
what
happened
after
they
began
to
roll
their
heads
being
withdrawn
but
tellydeb
watched
them
speed
toward
him
and
stepping
aside
he
aimed
a
strong
blow
with
his
ax
at
the
body
of
the
first
that
passed
him
instead
of
cutting
the
body
the
ax
bounced
back
and
flew
from
tellydeb
s
hand
into
the
air
falling
farther
away
than
the
long
arm
of
the
executioner
could
reach
therefore
he
was
left
helpless
and
was
wise
enough
to
surrender
without
further
resistance
finding
no
one
else
to
resist
them
the
contented
themselves
with
bounding
against
the
terrorized
people
great
and
humble
alike
and
knocking
them
over
laughing
boisterously
at
the
figures
sprawling
in
the
mud
of
the
streets
and
then
they
would
prick
the
bodies
of
the
men
with
their
sharp
thorns
making
them
spring
to
their
feet
again
with
shrieks
of
fear
only
to
be
bowled
over
again
the
next
minute
but
the
monsters
soon
grew
weary
of
this
amusement
for
they
were
anxious
to
explore
the
city
they
had
so
successfully
invaded
they
flocked
into
the
palace
and
public
buildings
and
gazed
eagerly
at
the
many
beautiful
and
to
them
novel
things
that
were
found
the
mirrors
delighted
them
and
they
fought
one
another
for
the
privilege
of
standing
before
the
glasses
to
admire
the
reflection
of
their
horrid
bodies
they
could
not
sit
in
the
chairs
for
the
round
bodies
would
not
fit
them
neither
could
the
understand
the
use
of
beds
for
when
they
rested
or
slept
the
creatures
merely
withdrew
their
limbs
and
heads
rolled
over
upon
their
backs
and
slept

where
they
might
be
the
shops
were
all
entered
and
robbed
of
their
wares
the
wantonly
destroying
all
that
they
could
not
use
they
were
like
ostriches
in
eating
anything
that
looked
attractive
to
them
one
of
the
monsters
swallowed
several
pretty
glass
beads
and
some
of
the
more
inquisitive
of
them
invaded
the
and
satisfied
their
curiosity
by
tasting
of
nearly
everything
in
sight
it
was
funny
to
see
their
wry
faces
when
they
sampled
the
salt
and
vinegar

stepping
aside
tellydeb
aimed
a
strong
blow
with
his
ax
at
the
body
of
the

presently
the
entire
city
was
under
the
dominion
of
the
who
forced
the
unhappy
people
to
wait
upon
them
and
amuse
them
and
if
any
hesitated
to
obey
their
commands
the
monsters
would
bump
against

pull
their
hair
and
make
them
suffer
most
miserably
aunt
rivette
was
in
her
room
at
the
top
of
the
palace
when
the
invaded
the
city
of
nole
at
first
she
was
as
much
frightened
as
the
others
but
she
soon
remembered
she
could
escape
the
creatures
by
flying
so
she
quietly
watched
them
from
the
windows
by
and
by
as
they
explored
the
palace
they
came
to
aunt
rivette
s
room
and
broke
in
the
door
but
the
old
woman
calmly
stepped
out
of
her
window
upon
a
little
iron
balcony
spread
her
great
wings
and
flew
away
before
the
could
catch
her
then
she
soared
calmly
through
the
air
and
having
remembered
that
bud
and
fluff
had
gone
to
the
river
on
a
picnic
she
flew
swiftly
in
that
direction
and
before
long
came
to
where
the
children
and
old
tallydab
were
eating
their
luncheon
while
the
dog
ruffles
who
was
in
good
spirits
sang
a
comic
song
to
amuse
them
they
were
much
surprised
to
see
aunt
rivette
flying
toward
them
but
when
she
alighted
and
told
bud
that
his
kingdom
had
been
conquered
by
the
and
all
his
people
enslaved
the
little
party
was
so
astonished
that
they
stared
at
one
another
in
speechless
amazement
oh
bud
what
shall
we
do
finally
asked
fluff
in
distress
don
t
know
said
bud
struggling
to
swallow
a
large
piece
of
sandwich
that
in
his
excitement
had
stuck
fast
in
his
throat
one
thing
is
certain
remarked
aunt
rivette
helping
herself
to
a
slice
of
cake
our
happy
lives
are
now
ruined
forever
we
should
be
foolish
to
remain
here
and
the
sooner
we
escape
to
some
other
country
where
the
can
not
find
us
the
safer
we
shall
but
why
run
away
asked
bud
can
t
something
else
be
done
here
tallydab
you
re
one
of
my
counselors
what
do
you
say
about
this
affair
now
the
lord
high
steward
was
a
deliberate
old
fellow
and
before
he
replied
he
dusted
the
crumbs
from
his
lap
filled
and
lighted
his
long
pipe
and
smoked
several
whiffs
in
a
thoughtful
manner
it
strikes
me
said
he
at
last
that
by
means
of
the
princess
fluff
s
magic
cloak
we
can
either
destroy
or
scatter
these
rascally
invaders
and
restore
the
kingdom
to
peace
and
illustration
but
where
s
the
cloak
asked
the
sure
enough
replied
bud
why
didn
t
we
think
of
that
before
you
will
have
to
make
the
wish
bud
said
fluff
for
all
the
rest
of
us
have
wished
and
you
have
not
made
yours
all
right
answered
the
king
if
i
must
i
must
but
i
m
sorry
i
have
to
do
it
now
for
i
was
saving
my
wish
for
something
but
where
s
the
cloak
asked
the
dog
rudely
breaking
into
the
conversation
you
can
t
wish
without
the
the
cloak
is
locked
up
in
a
drawer
in
my
room
at
the
palace
said
fluff
and
our
enemies
have
possession
of
the
palace
continued
tallydab
gloomily
was
there
ever
such
ill
luck
never
mind
said
aunt
rivette
i
ll
fly
back
and
get
is
if
the
haven
t
already
broken
open
the
drawer
and
discovered
the
please
go
at
once
then
exclaimed
fluff
here
is
the
key
and
she
unfastened
it
from
the
chain
at
her
neck
and
handed
it
to
her
aunt
but
be
careful
whatever
you
do
that
those
horrible
creatures
do
not
catch
i
m
not
afraid
said
aunt
rivette
confidently
and
taking
the
key
the
old
lady
at
once
flew
away
in
the
direction
of
the
city
of
nole
promising
to
return
very
soon
chapter
xix
the
bravery
of
aunt
rivette
the
were
so
busy
rioting
that
they
did
not
look
into
the
air
and
discover
aunt
rivette
flying
over
the
city
so
she
alighted
all
unobserved
upon
a
balcony
of
the
palace
just
outside
the
chamber
of
the
princess
fluff
and
succeeded
in
entering
the
room
the
creatures
had
ransacked
this
apartment
as
they
had
every
other
part
of
the
royal
palace
and
fluff
s
pretty
dresses
and
ornaments
were
strewn
about
in
dreadful
confusion
but
the
drawer
in
which
rested
the
magic
cloak
was
still
locked
and
in
a
few
moments
the
old
woman
had
the
precious
garment
in
her
hands
it
was
as
we
know
the
imitation
cloak
queen
zixi
had
made
and
exchanged
for
the
real
one
but
so
closely
did
it
resemble
the
fairy
cloak
that
aunt
rivette
had
no
idea
she
was
carrying
a
useless
garment
back
to
her
little
niece
and
nephew
on
the
contrary
she
thought
to
herself
now
we
can
quickly
dispose
of
these
monstrous
rogues
and
drive
them
back
to
their
own
hearing
some
one
moving
about
in
the
next
room
she
ran
to
the
window
and
soon
was
flying
away
with
the
cloak
to
the
place
where
she
had
left
bud
and
fluff
good
cried
the
lord
high
steward
when
he
saw
the
cloak
now
we
have
nothing
more
to
fear
put
on
your
cloak
your
majesty
and
make
the
bud
threw
the
cloak
over
his
shoulders
what
shall
i
wish
he
asked
let
me
see
answered
tallydab
what
we
want
is
to
get
rid
of
these
invaders
wish
them
all
in
the
kingdom
of
oh
no
cried
fluff
it
would
be
wicked
to
injure
queen
zixi
and
her
people
let
us
wish
the
back
where
they
came
that
would
be
folly
said
the
dog
ruffles
with
an
accent
of
scorn
for
they
could
easily
return
again
to
our
city
of
nole
having
once
learned
the
way
that
is
true
agreed
aunt
rivette
the
safest
thing
to
do
is
to
wish
them
all
but
it
would
be
an
awful
job
to
bury
so
many
great
balls
objected
bud
it
would
keep
all
our
people
busy
for
a
month
at
why
not
wish
them
dead
and
buried
asked
ruffles
then
they
would
be
out
of
the
way
for
good
and
a
capital
idea
responded
tallydab
but
i
haven
t
seen
these
curious
creatures
yet
said
bud
and
if
i
now
wish
them
all
dead
and
buried
i
shall
never
get
a
glimpse
of
one
of
them
so
let
s
walk
boldly
into
the
city
and
when
they
appear
to
interfere
with
us
i
ll
make
the
wish
and
the
will
instantly
so
the
entire
party
returned
to
the
city
of
nole
bud
and
fluff
riding
their
ponies
aunt
rivette
fluttering
along
beside
them
and
the
lord
high
steward
walking
behind
with
his
dog
the
were
so
much
surprised
to
see
this
little
party
boldly
entering
the
streets
of
the
city
and
showing
no
particle
of
fear
of
them
that
they
at
first
made
no
offer
to
molest
them
even
when
bud
roared
with
laughter
at
their
queer
appearance

you
re
sure
you

before
aren

you

sure
said
bud
perhaps
said
aunt
rivette
the
fairies
have
no
power
over
these
horrible
that
must
be
it
of
course
said
the
princess
but
what
shall
we
do
now
our
country
is
entirely
conquered
by
these
monsters
so
it
isn
t
a
safe
place
for
us
to
stay
i
believe
i
can
carry
you
anywhere
you

like
to

suppose
we
go
to

zixi
and
ask
her
to
protect

the

suggested
that
s
all
right
if
she
doesn

bear
us
a
grudge
you

we
knocked

the

beautiful
and
kind
to
her
people
said
the
girl
well
there
s
no
one
else
we
can
trust

answered
gloomily
so
we
may
as
well
try
zixi
but
if
you

either
of
us
on
the
way
aunt
rivette
i

the

in
the
palace
of
the
bud
and
fluff
were
surprised
at
the
magnificence
of
the
city
of
ix
the
had
reigned
there
so
many
centuries
that
she
found
plenty
of
time
to
carry
out
her
ideas
and
the
gardens
shrubbery
and
buildings
were
beautifully
planned
and
cared
for
the
splendid
palace
of
the
queen
was
in
the
center
of
a
delightful
park
with
white
marble
walks
leading
up
to
the
front
door
aunt
rivette
landed
the
children
at
the
entrance
to
this
royal
park
and
they
walked
slowly
toward
the
palace
admiring
the
gleaming
white
statues
the
fountains
and
flowers
as
they
went
it
was
beginning
to
grow
dusk
and
the
lights
were
gleaming
in
the
palace
window
when
they
reached
it
dozens
of
liveried
servants
were
standing
near
the
entrance
and
some
of
these
escorted
the
strangers
with
much
courtesy
to
a
reception
room
there
a
master
of
ceremonies
met
them
and
asked
in
what
way
he
might
serve
them
this
politeness
almost
took
bud
s
breath
away
for
he
had
considered
queen
zixi
in
the
light
of
an
enemy
rather
than
a
friend
but
he
decided
not
to
sail
under
false
colors
so
he
drew
himself
up
in
royal
fashion
and
answered
i
am
king
bud
of
noland
and
this
is
my
sister
princess
fluff
and
my
aunt
rivette
my
kingdom
has
been
conquered
by
a
horde
of
monsters
and
i
have
come
to
the
queen
of
ix
to
ask
her
the
master
of
ceremonies
bowed
low
and
said
i
m
sure
queen
zixi
will
be
glad
to
assist
your
majesty
permit
me
to
escort
you
to
rooms
that
you
may
prepare
for
an
interview
with
her
as
soon
a
she
can
receive
so
they
were
led
to
luxurious
chambers
and
were
supplied
with
perfumed
baths
and
clean
raiment
which
proved
very
refreshing
after
their
tedious
journey
through
the
air
it
was
now
evening
and
when
they
were
ushered
into
the
queen
s
the
palace
was
brilliantly
lighted
zixi
since
her
great
disappointment
in
the
had
decided
that
her
longing
to
behold
a
beautiful
reflection
in
her
mirror
was
both
impossible
and
foolish
so
she
had
driven
the
desire
from
her
heart
and
devoted
herself
to
ruling
her
kingdom
wisely
as
she
had
ruled
before
the
idea
of
stealing
the
magic
cloak
had
taken
possession
of
her
and
when
her
mind
was
in
normal
condition
the
was
very
sweet
and
agreeable
in
disposition
so
queen
zixi
greeted
bud
and
his
sister
and
aunt
with
great
kindness
kissing
fluff
affectionately
upon
her
cheek
and
giving
her
own
hand
to
bud
to
kiss
it
is
not
strange
that
the
children
considered
her
the
most
beautiful
person
they
had
ever
beheld
and
to
them
she
was
as
gentle
as
beautiful
listening
with
much
interest
to
their
tale
of
the
invasion
of
the
and
promising
to
assist
them
by
every
means
in
her
power
this
made
bud
somewhat
ashamed
of
his
past
enmity
so
he
said
bluntly
i
am
sorry
we
defeated
your
army
and
made
them
illustration
queen
zixi
greeted
bud
and
his
sister
and
aunt
with
great
why
that
was
the
only
thing
you
could
do
when
i
had
invaded
your
dominion
answered
zixi
i
admit
that
you
were
in
the
right
and
that
i
deserved
my
but
why
did
you
try
to
conquer
us
asked
fluff
because
i
wanted
to
secure
the
magic
cloak
of
which
i
had
heard
so
much
returned
the
queen
frankly
oh
said
the
girl
but
of
course
you
understand
that
if
i
had
known
the
magic
cloak
could
not
grant
any
more
wishes
i
would
not
have
been
so
eager
to
secure
it
continued
zixi
no
said
bud
the
old
thing
won
t
work
any
more
and
we
nearly
got
captured
by
the
before
we
found
it
oh
have
you
the
cloak
again
asked
zixi
with
a
look
of
astonishment
yes
indeed
returned
the
princess
it
was
locked
up
in
my
drawer
and
aunt
rivette
managed
to
get
it
for
me
before
the
could
find
locked
in
your
drawer
repeated
the
musingly
then
i
am
sorry
to
say
you
have
not
the
fairy
cloak
at
all
but
the
imitation
what
do
you
mean
asked
fluff
greatly
surprised
why
i
must
make
a
confession
said
zixi
with
a
laugh
i
tried
many
ways
to
steal
your
magic
cloak
first
i
came
to
nole
as
miss
do
you
remember
oh
yes
cried
fluff
and
i
mistrusted
you
from
the
and
then
i
sent
my
army
to
capture
the
cloak
but
when
both
of
these
plans
failed
i
disguised
myself
as
the
girl
adlena
exclaimed
the
princess
why
i
ve
often
wondered
what
became
of
my
maid
adlena
and
why
she
left
me
so
suddenly
and
well
she
exchanged
an
imitation
cloak
for
the
one
the
fairies
had
given
you
said
zixi
with
a
smile
and
then
she
ran
away
with
the
precious
garment
leaving
in
your
drawer
a
cloak
that
resembled
the
magic
garment
but
had
no
magical
how
dreadful
said
fluff
but
it
did
me
no
good
went
on
the
queen
sadly
for
when
i
made
a
wish
the
cloak
could
not
grant
because
it
was
stolen
cried
the
girl
eagerly
the
fairy
who
gave
it
to
me
said
that
if
the
cloak
was
stolen
it
would
never
grant
a
wish
to
the
oh
said
zixi
astonished
i
did
not
know
of
course
not
fluff
replied
with
a
rather
triumphant
smile
but
if
you
had
only
come
to
me
and
told
me
frankly
that
you
wanted
to
use
the
cloak
i
would
gladly
have
lent
it
to
you
and
then
you
could
have
had
your
well
well
said
zixi
much
provoked
with
herself
to
think
i
have
been
so
wicked
all
for
nothing
when
i
might
have
succeeded
without
the
least
trouble
had
i
frankly
asked
for
what
i
wanted
here
said
bud
beginning
to
understand
the
tangle
of
events
i
must
have
worn
the
imitation
cloak
when
i
made
my
wish
and
that
was
the
reason
that
my
wish
didn
t
come
to
be
sure
rejoined
fluff
and
so
it
is
nothing
but
the
imitation
cloak
we
have
brought
no
wonder
it
would
not
destroy
and
bury
the
declared
the
boy
sulkily
but
if
this
is
the
imitation
where
then
is
the
real
magic
cloak
why
i
believe
i
left
it
in
the
replied
zixi
then
we
must
find
it
at
once
said
bud
for
only
by
its
aid
can
we
get
rid
of
those
and
afterward
i
will
gladly
lend
it
to
you
also
i
promise
now
to
lend
it
to
you
said
fluff
turning
to
the
queen
and
your
wish
will
be
fulfilled
after
it
may
illustration
because
it
was
stolen
cried
the
girl
this
expression
of
kindness
and
good
will
brought
great
joy
to
zixi
and
she
seized
the
generous
child
in
her
arms
and
kissed
her
with
real
gratitude
we
will
start
for
the
morning
she
exclaimed
delightedly
and
before
night
both
king
bud
and
i
will
have
our
wishes
fulfilled
then
the
led
them
to
her
royal
where
a
most
delightful
dinner
was
served
and
all
the
courtiers
and
officers
of
zixi
bowed
low
first
before
the
king
of
noland
and
then
before
his
sweet
little
sister
and
promised
them
the
friendship
of
the
entire
kingdom
of
ix
quavo
the
wandering
minstrel
chanced
to
be
present
that
evening
and
he
sang
a
complimentary
song
about
king
bud
and
a
wonderful
song
about
the
flying
lady
meaning
aunt
rivette
and
a
beautiful
song
about
the
lovely
princess
fluff
so
every
one
was
happy
and
contented
as
they
all
looked
forward
to
the
morrow
to
regain
the
magic
cloak
and
by
its
means
to
bring
an
end
to
all
their
worries

the
search
for
the
magic
cloak
the
sun
had
scarcely
risen
next
morning
when
our
friends
left
the
city
of
ix
in
search
of
the
magic
cloak
all
were
mounted
on
strong
horses
with
a
dozen
soldiers
riding
behind
to
protect
them
from
harm
while
the
royal
steward
of
the
followed
with
two
donkeys
laden
with
hampers
of
provisions
from
which
to
feed
the
travelers
on
their
way
it
was
a
long
journey
to
the
wide
river
but
they
finally
reached
it
and
engaged
the
ferryman
to
take
them
across
the
ferryman
did
not
like
to
visit
the
other
shore
which
was
in
the
kingdom
of
noland
for
several
of
the
had
already
been
seen
upon
the
but
the
guard
of
soldiers
reassured
the
man
so
he
rowed
his
big
boat
across
with
the
entire
party
and
set
them
safely
on
the
shore
the
ferryman
s
little
daughter
was
in
the
boat
but
she
was
not
sobbing
on
the
contrary
her
face
was
all
smiles
do
you
not
still
wish
to
be
a
man
asked
zixi
patting
the
child
s
head
no
indeed
answered
the
little
maid
for
i
have
discovered
all
men
must
work
very
hard
to
support
their
wives
and
children
and
to
buy
them
food
and
raiment
so
i
have
changed
my
mind
about
becoming
a
man
especially
as
that
would
be
it
was
not
far
from
the
ferry
to
the
grove
of
lilacs
and
as
they
rode
along
zixi
saw
the
gray
owl
sitting
contentedly
in
a
tree
and
pruning
its
feathers
are
you
no
longer
wailing
because
you
can
not
swim
in
the
river
asked
the
speaking
in
the
owl
language
no
indeed
answered
the
gray
owl
for
as
i
watched
a
fish
swimming
in
the
water
a
man
caught
it
on
a
sharp
hook
and
the
fish
was
killed
i
believe
i
m
safer
in
a
i
believe
so
too
said
zixi
and
rode
along
more
thoughtfully
for
she
remembered
her
own
desire
and
wondered
if
it
would
also
prove
foolish
just
as
they
left
the
she
noticed
the
old
alligator
sunning
himself
happily
upon
the
bank
illustration
of
course
answered
the
alligator
opening
one
eye
to
observe
his
have
you
ceased
weeping
because
you
can
not
climb
a
tree
asked
the
of
course
answered
the
alligator
opening
one
eye
to
observe
his
questioner
for
a
boy
climbed
a
tree
near
me
yesterday
and
fell
out
of
it
and
broke
his
leg
it
is
quite
foolish
to
climb
trees
i
m
sure
i
am
safer
in
the
zixi
made
no
reply
but
she
agreed
with
the
alligator
who
called
after
her
sleepily
isn
t
it
fortunate
we
can
not
have
everything
we
are
stupid
enough
to
wish
for
shortly
afterward
they
left
the
and
approached
the
the
riding
first
through
the
trees
to
show
the
place
where
she
had
dropped
the
magic
cloak
she
knew
it
was
near
the
little
spring
where
she
had
gazed
at
her
reflection
in
the
water
but
although
they
searched
over
every
inch
of
ground
they
could
discover
no
trace
of
the
lost
cloak
it
is
really
too
bad
exclaimed
zixi
with
vexation
some
one
must
have
come
through
the
grove
and
taken
the
cloak
but
we
must
find
it
said
bud
earnestly
for
otherwise
i
shall
not
be
able
to
rescue
my
people
from
the
let
us
inquire
of
every
one
we
meet
if
they
have
seen
the
cloak
suggested
princess
fluff
in
that
way
we
may
discover
who
has
taken
so
they
made
a
camp
on
the
edge
of
the
grove
and
for
two
days
they
stopped
and
questioned
all
who
passed
that
way
but
none
had
ever
seen
or
heard
of
a
cloak
like
that
described
illustration
we
have
lost
a
beautiful
cloak
in
the
said
queen
zixi
to
the
finally
an
old
shepherd
came
along
hobbling
painfully
after
a
flock
of
five
sheep
for
he
suffered
much
from
rheumatism
we
have
lost
a
beautiful
cloak
in
the
said
zixi
to
the
shepherd
when
did
you
lose
it
asked
the
old
man
pausing
to
lean
upon
his
stick
several
days
ago
returned
the
queen
it
was
bright
as
the
rainbow
and
woven
with
threads
finer
i
know
i
know
interrupted
the
shepherd
for
i
myself
found
it
lying
upon
the
ground
beneath
the
hurrah
cried
bud
gleefully
at
last
we
have
found
it
and
all
the
others
were
fully
as
delighted
as
he
was
but
where
have
you
put
the
cloak
inquired
zixi
why
i
gave
it
to
dame
dingle
who
lives
under
the
hill
yonder
replied
the
man
pointing
far
away
over
the
fields
and
she
gave
me
in
exchange
some
medicine
for
my
rheumatism
which
has
made
the
pain
considerably
worse
so
i
threw
the
bottle
into
the
they
did
not
pause
to
listen
further
to
the
shepherd
s
talk
for
all
were
now
intent
on
reaching
the
cottage
of
dame
dingle
so
the
soldiers
saddled
the
horses
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
galloping
away
toward
the
hill
it
was
a
long
ride
over
rough
ground
but
finally
they
came
near
the
hill
and
saw
a
tiny
tumbledown
cottage
just
at
its
foot
hastily
dismounting
bud
fluff
and
the
queen
rushed
into
the
cottage
where
a
wrinkled
old
woman
was
bent
nearly
double
over
a
upon
which
she
was
sewing
patches
where
is
the
cloak
cried
the
three
in
a
breath
the
woman
did
not
raise
her
head
but
counted
her
stitches
in
a
slow
monotonous
tone
where
is
the
magic
cloak
demanded
zixi
stamping
her
foot
impatiently
said
dame
dingle
slowly
there
i
ve
broken
my
needle
answer
us
at
once
commanded
bud
sternly
where
is
the
magic
cloak
the
woman
paid
no
attention
to
him
whatever
she
carefully
selected
a
new
needle
threaded
it
after
several
attempts
and
began
anew
to
stitch
the
patch
twenty
she
mumbled
in
a
low
voice
but
now
zixi
snatched
the
work
from
her
hands
and
exclaimed
if
you
do
not
answer
at
once
i
will
give
you
a
good
beating
that
is
all
right
said
the
dame
looking
up
at
them
through
her
spectacles
the
patches
take
stitches
on
each
side
and
if
i
lose
my
count
i
get
mixed
up
but
it
s
all
right
now
what
do
you
want
the
cloak
the
old
shepherd
gave
you
replied
the
queen
sharply
the
pretty
cloak
with
the
bright
colors
asked
the
dame
calmly
yes
yes
answered
the
three
excitedly
why
that
very
patch
i
was
sewing
was
cut
from
that
cloak
said
dame
dingle
isn
t
it
lovely
and
it
brightens
the
rest
of
the
do
you
mean
that
you
have
cut
up
my
magic
cloak
asked
fluff
in
amazement
while
the
others
were
too
horrified
to
speak
certainly
said
the
woman
the
cloak
was
too
fine
for
me
to
wear
and
i
needed
something
bright
in
my
so
i
cut
up
half
of
the
cloak
and
made
patches
of
the
gave
a
gasp
and
sat
down
suddenly
upon
a
rickety
bench
princess
fluff
walked
to
the
door
and
stood
looking
out
that
the
others
might
not
see
the
tears
of
disappointment
in
her
eyes
bud
alone
stood
scowling
in
front
of
the
old
dame
and
presently
he
said
to
her
in
a
harsh
tone
you
ought
to
be
smothered
with
your
own
for
daring
to
cut
up
the
fairy
cloak
the
fairy
cloak
echoed
dame
dingle
what
do
you
mean
that
cloak
was
a
gift
to
my
sister
from
the
fairies
said
bud
and
it
had
a
magic
charm
aren
t
you
afraid
the
fairies
will
punish
you
for
what
you
have
done
illustration
where
is
the
cloak
cried
the
three
in
a
dame
dingle
was
greatly
disturbed
how
could
i
know
it
she
asked
anxiously
how
could
i
know
it
was
a
magic
cloak
that
old
edi
gave
to
me
well
it
was
and
woven
by
the
fairies
themselves
retorted
the
boy
and
a
whole
nation
is
in
danger
because
you
have
wickedly
cut
it
dame
dingle
tried
to
cry
to
show
that
she
was
sorry
and
so
escape
punishment
she
put
her
apron
over
her
face
and
rocked
herself
back
and
forth
and
made
an
attempt
to
squeeze
a
tear
out
of
her
eyes
suddenly
zixi
jumped
up
why
it
isn
t
so
bad
after
all
she
exclaimed
we
can
sew
the
cloak
together
of
course
said
fluff
coming
from
the
doorway
why
didn
t
we
think
of
that
at
once
where
is
the
rest
of
the
cloak
demanded
zixi
dame
dingle
went
to
a
chest
and
drew
forth
the
half
of
the
cloak
that
had
not
been
cut
up
there
was
no
doubt
about
its
being
the
magic
cloak
the
golden
thread
queen
lulea
had
woven
could
be
seen
plainly
in
the
web
and
the
brilliant
colors
were
as
fresh
and
lovely
as
ever
but
the
flowing
skirt
of
the
cloak
had
been
ruthlessly
hacked
by
dame
dingle
s
shears
and
presented
a
sorry
plight
get
us
the
patches
you
have
cut
commanded
zixi
and
without
a
word
the
dame
drew
from
her
basket
five
small
squares
and
then
ripped
from
the
the
one
she
had
just
sewn
on
but
this
isn
t
enough
said
fluff
when
she
had
spread
the
cloak
upon
the
floor
and
matched
the
pieces
where
is
the
rest
of
the
cloak
why
stammered
dame
dingle
with
hesitation
i
gave
them
gave
them
away
who
got
them
said
bud
why
friends
of
mine
were
here
from
the
village
last
evening
and
we
traded
patches
so
each
of
us
would
have
a
variety
for
our
well
and
i
gave
each
of
them
one
of
the
patches
from
the
pretty
well
you
a
ninny
declared
bud
scornfully
yes
your
majesty
i
believe
i
am
answered
dame
dingle
meekly
we
must
go
to
the
village
and
gather
up
those
pieces
said
zixi
can
you
tell
us
the
names
of
your
friends
she
asked
the
woman
of
course
responded
dame
dingle
they
were
nancy
nink
betsy
barx
sally
sog
molly
mitt
and
lucy
before
we
go
to
the
village
let
us
make
dame
dingle
sew
these
portions
of
the
cloak
together
suggested
fluff
the
dame
was
glad
enough
to
do
this
and
she
threaded
her
needle
at
once
so
deft
and
fine
was
her
needlework
that
she
mended
the
cloak
most
beautifully
so
that
from
a
short
distance
away
no
one
could
discover
that
the
cloak
had
been
darned
but
a
great
square
was
still
missing
from
the
front
and
our
friends
were
now
eager
to
hasten
to
the
village
this
will
cause
us
some
delay
said
the
more
cheerfully
but
the
cloak
will
soon
be
complete
again
and
then
we
can
have
our
fluff
took
the
precious
cloak
over
her
arm
and
then
they
all
mounted
their
horses
and
rode
away
toward
the
village
which
dame
dingle
pointed
out
from
her
doorway
zixi
was
sorry
for
the
old
creature
who
had
been
more
foolish
than
wicked
and
the
left
a
bright
gold
piece
in
the
woman
s
hand
when
she
bade
her
which
was
worth
more
to
dame
dingle
than
three
pretty
cloaks
the
ground
was
boggy
and
uneven
so
they
were
forced
to
ride
slowly
to
the
little
village
but
they
arrived
there
at
last
and
began
hunting
for
the
old
women
who
had
received
pieces
of
the
magic
cloak
they
were
easily
found
and
all
seemed
willing
enough
to
give
up
their
patches
when
the
importance
of
the
matter
was
explained
to
them
at
the
s
suggestion
each
woman
fitted
her
patch
to
the
cloak
and
sewed
it
on
very
neatly
but
lucy
lum
the
last
of
the
five
said
to
them
this
is
only
half
of
the
patch
dame
dingle
gave
me
the
other
part
i
gave
to
the
miller
s
wife
down
in
the
valley
where
the
river
bends
but
i
am
sure
she
will
be
glad
to
let
you
have
it
only
requires
that
small
piece
to
complete
the
cloak
and
make
it
as
good
as
it
was
magic
cloak
except
for
a
small
square
at
the
bottom
was
now
complete
and
such
skillful
needlewomen
were
these
makers
that
it
was
difficult
to
tell
where
it
had
been
cut
and
afterward
mended
but
the
miller
s
wife
must
now
be
seen
so
they
all
mounted
the
horses
again
except
aunt
rivette
who
grumbled
that
so
much
riding
made
her
bones
rattle
and
that
she
preferred
to
fly
which
she
did
frightening
the
horses
to
such
an
extent
with
her
wings
that
bud
made
her
keep
well
in
advance
of
them
they
were
all
in
good
spirits
now
for
soon
the
magic
cloak
almost
as
good
as
new
would
be
again
in
their
possession
and
fluff
and
bud
had
been
greatly
worried
over
the
fate
of
their
friends
who
had
been
left
to
the
mercy
of
the
terrible
the
path
ran
in
a
zigzag
direction
down
into
the
valley
but
at
length
it
led
the
party
to
the
mill
where
old
rivette
was
found
sitting
in
the
doorway
awaiting
them
the
miller
s
wife
when
summoned
came
to
them
drying
her
hands
on
her
apron
for
she
had
been
washing
the
dishes
we
want
to
get
the
patch
lucy
lum
gave
you
explained
fluff
for
it
was
part
of
my
magic
cloak
which
the
fairies
gave
to
me
and
this
is
the
place
where
it
must
be
sewn
to
complete
the
and
she
showed
the
woman
the
cloak
with
the
square
missing
i
see
said
the
miller
s
wife
nodding
her
head
and
i
am
very
sorry
i
can
not
give
you
the
piece
to
complete
your
cloak
but
the
fact
is
i
considered
it
too
pretty
for
my
so
i
gave
it
to
my
son
for
a
illustration
and
where
is
your
son
demanded
and
where
is
your
son
demanded
zixi
oh
he
is
gone
to
sea
for
he
is
a
sailor
by
this
time
he
is
far
away
upon
the
bud
fluff
and
the
looked
at
one
another
in
despair
this
seemed
indeed
to
destroy
all
their
hopes
for
the
one
portion
of
the
cloak
that
they
needed
was
far
beyond
their
reach
nothing
remained
but
for
them
to
return
to
zixi
s
palace
and
await
the
time
when
the
miller
s
son
should
return
from
his
voyage
but
before
they
went
the
queen
said
to
the
woman
when
he
returns
you
may
tell
your
son
that
if
he
will
bring
to
me
the
necktie
you
gave
him
i
will
give
him
in
return
fifty
gold
and
i
will
give
him
fifty
more
said
bud
promptly
and
i
will
give
him
enough
ribbon
to
make
fifty
neckties
added
fluff
the
miller
s
wife
was
delighted
at
the
prospect
thank
you
thank
you
she
exclaimed
my
boy
s
fortune
is
made
he
can
now
marry
imogene
gubb
and
settle
down
on
a
farm
and
give
up
the
sea
forever
and
his
neckties
will
be
the
envy
of
all
the
men
in
the
country
as
soon
as
he
returns
i
will
send
him
to
you
with
the
bit
of
the
cloak
which
you
but
zixi
was
so
anxious
that
nothing
might
happen
to
prevent
the
miller
s
son
from
returning
the
necktie
that
she
left
two
of
her
soldiers
at
the
mill
with
instructions
to
bring
the
man
to
her
palace
the
instant
he
returned
home
as
they
rode
away
they
were
all
very
despondent
over
the
ill
luck
of
their
journey
he
may
be
drowned
at
sea
said
bud
or
he
may
lose
the
necktie
on
the
voyage
said
fluff
oh
a
thousand
things
happen
returned
the
queen
but
we
need
not
make
ourselves
unhappy
imagining
them
let
us
hope
the
miller
s
son
will
soon
return
and
restore
to
us
the
missing
which
showed
that
zixi
had
not
lived
six
hundred
and
years
without
gaining
some

the
queen
insisted
that

and
fluff
with
their
aunt
rivette
should
remain
her
guests
until
the
cloak
could
be
restored
to
its
former

for

something

might

safely
locked

with
much

to

so
sad

of

sufferings
of
the
five
high
counselors
and
all
the
people
of

at
the
hands
of
the
fierce
that
princess
fluff
wept
bitterly
for
her
friends
and
bud
became
so
cross
and
disagreeable
that
even
zixi
was
provoked
with
him
something
really
must
be
done
declared
the
queen
i
ll
brew
a
magical
mess
in
my
and
see
if
i
can
find
a
way
to
destroy
those
detestable
indeed
she
feared
the
creatures
would
some
day
find
their
way
into

so
when
all
the
rest
of
those
in
the
palace
were
sound
asleep
zixi
worked
her
magic
spell
and
from
the
imps
she
summoned
she
obtained
advice
how
to
act
in
order
to
get
rid
of
the
next
morning
she
questioned
ruffles
carefully
what
do
the
eat
she
asked
everything
said
the
dog
for
they
have
no
judgment
and
consume
buttons
and
hairpins
as
eagerly
as
they
do
food
but
there
is
one
thing
they
are
really
fond
of
and
that
is
soup
they
oblige
old
tollydob
the
lord
high
general
who
works
in
the
palace
kitchen
to
make
them
a
kettle
of
soup
every
morning
and
this
they
all
eat
as
if
they
were
half
very
good
exclaimed
the
with
pleasure
i
think
i
see
a
way
of
ridding
all
noland
of
these
monsters
here
is
a
silver
vial
filled
with
a
magic
liquid
i
will
tie
it
around
your

and
you
must
return
to
the

carry
the

tell
him

on

into

let
no

taste
it

what
then
asked

i
will
myself
take

swords
and
spears
are
useless
where
the
are
concerned
as
nothing
can
pierce
their
tough
bodies
and
more
nations
have
been
conquered
by
cunning
than
by
force
of
bud
and
fluff
not
knowing
what
the
meant
to
do
were
much
disturbed
by
these
preparations
to
march
upon
the
the
monsters
had
terrified
them
so
greatly
that
they
dreaded
to
meet
with
them
again
and
bud
declared
that
the
safest
plan
was
to
remain
in
zixi
s
kingdom
and
await
the
coming
of
the
miller
s
son
with
the
necktie
but
remonstrated
zixi
in
the
meantime
your
people
are
suffering
i
know
said
bud
and
it
nearly
drives
me
frantic
to
think
of
it
but
they
will
be
no
better
off
if
we
try
to
fight
the
and
are
ourselves
made
why
not
try
the
magic
cloak
as
it
is
suggested
the
princess
and
see
if
it
won
t
grant
wishes
as
before
there
s
only
a
small
piece
missing
and
it
may
not
make
any
difference
with
the
power
the
fairies
gave
to
hooray
shouted
bud
that
s
a
good
idea
it
s
a
magic
cloak
just
the
same
even
if
there
is
a
chunk
cut
out
of
zixi
agreed
that
it
was
worth
a
trial
so
the
cloak
was
taken
from
the
silver
casket
and
brought
into
the
queen
s
let
us
try
it
on
one
of
your
maids
of
honor
first
said
fluff
and
if
it
grants
her
wish
we
will
know
the
cloak
has
lost
none
of
its
magic
powers
then
you
and
bud
may
both
make
your
very
well
returned
the
queen
and
she
summoned
one
of
her
maids
i
am
going
to
lend
you
my
cloak
said
the
princess
to
the
maid
and
while
you
wear
it
you
must
make
a
she
threw
the
cloak
over
the
girl
s
shoulders
and
after
a
moment
s
thought
the
maid
said
i
wish
for
a
bushel
of
fudge
said
bud
scornfully
no
all
kinds
of
candies
answered
the
maid
of
honor
but
although
they
watched
her
intently
the
wish
failed
absolutely
for
no
bushel
of
candies
appeared
in
sight
let
us
try
it
again
suggested
fluff
while
the
others
wore
disappointed
expressions
it
was
a
foolish
wish
anyhow
and
perhaps
the
fairies
did
not
care
to
grant
so
another
maid
was
called
and
given
the
cloak
to
wear
illustration
and
may
i
wish
for
anything
i
desire
she
asked
and
may
i
wish
for
anything
i
desire
she
asked
eagerly
of
course
answered
the
princess
but
as
you
can
have
but
one
wish
you
must
choose
something
oh
i
will
declared
the
maid
i
wish
i
had
yellow
hair
and
blue
why
did
you
wish
that
asked
fluff
angrily
for
the
girl
had
pretty
brown
hair
and
eyes
because
the
young
man
i
am
going
to
marry
says
he
likes
blondes
better
than
brunettes
answered
the
maid
blushing
but
her
hair
did
not
change
its
color
for
all
the
wish
and
the
maid
said
with
evident
disappointment
your
magic
cloak
seems
to
be
a
it
does
not
grant
foolish
wishes
returned
the
princess
as
she
dismissed
her
when
the
maid
had
gone
zixi
asked
well
are
you
satisfied
yes
acknowledged
fluff
the
cloak
will
not
grant
wishes
unless
it
is
complete
we
must
wait
for
the
sailorman
s
then
my
army
shall
march
morning
said
the
queen
and
she
went
away
to
give
the

generals

the
destruction
of
the
monsters
it
was
tuesday
when
the
army
of
ix
started
upon
its
second
march
into
noland
with
it
were
the
king
bud
princess
fluff
and
aunt
rivette
at
evening
they
encamped
on
the
bank
of
the
river
and
on
wednesday
the
army
was
ferried
across
and
marched
up
the
side
of
the
mountain
that
separated
them
from
the
valley
of
noland
by
night
they
had
reached
the
summit
of
the
mountain
but
they
did
not
mount
upon
the
ridge
for
fear
they
might
be
seen
by
the
zixi
commanded
them
all
to
remain
quietly
behind
the
ridge
and
they
lighted
no
fires
and
spoke
only
in
whispers
and
although
so
many
thousands
of
men
lay
close
to
the
valley
of
noland
not
a
sound
came
from
them
to
warn
the
monsters
that
an
enemy
was
near
thursday
morning
dawned
bright
and
pleasant
and
as
soon
as
the
sun
was
up
the
came
crowding
around
the
palace
kitchen
demanding
that
old
tollydob
hurry
the
preparation
of
their
soup
this
the
general
did
trembling
in
spite
of
his
ten
feet
of
stature
for
if
they
were
kept
waiting
the
monsters
were
liable
to
prod
his
flesh
with
their
thorns
but
tollydob
did
not
forget
to
empty
the
contents
of
the
silver
vial
into
the
soup
as
the
dog
ruffles
had
told
him
to
do
and
soon
it
was
being
ladled
out
to
the
by
jikki
the
four
high
counselors
and
a
dozen
other
enslaved
officers
of
king
bud
and
the
dog
ruffles
ran
through
the
city
crying
to
every
he
met
hurry
and
get
your
soup
before
it
is
gone
it
is
especially
good
this
morning
so
every
in
the
valley
hurried
to
the
palace
kitchen
for
soup
and
there
were
so
many
that
it
was
noon
before
the
last
were
served
while
these
became
so
impatient
that
they
abused
their
slaves
in
a
sad
manner
yet
even
while
the
last
were
eating
those
who
had
earlier
partaken
of
the
soup
lay
around
the
palace
sound
asleep
and
snoring
loudly
for
the
contents
of
the
silver
vial
had
the
effect
of
sending
all
of
them
to
sleep
within
an
hour
and
rendering
them
wholly
unconscious
for
a
period
of
ten
hours
illustration
and
the
dog
ruffles
ran
through
the
city
crying
to
every
he
met
hurry
and
get
your
all
through
the
city
the
lay
asleep
and
as
they
always
withdrew
their
heads
and
limbs
into
their
bodies
when
they
slumbered
they
presented
a
spectacle
of
thousands
of
huge
balls
lying
motionless
illustration
all
through
the
city
the
lay
when
the
big
kettle
was
finally
empty
and
the
lord
high
general
paused
to
wipe
the
perspiration
from
his
brow
the
last
of
the
were
rolling
over
on
their
backs
from
the
effects
of
the
potion
which
the
brewed
and
placed
in
the
silver
vial
aunt
rivette
had
been
flying
over
the
city
since
early
morning
and
although
the
had
been
too
intent
upon
their
breakfast
to
notice
her
the
old
woman
s
sharp
eyes
had
watched
everything
that
took
place
below
now
when
all
the
monsters
had
succumbed
to
the
aunt
rivette
flew
back
to
the
mountain
where
the
army
of
ix
was
hidden
and
carried
the
news
to
the
zixi
at
once
ordered
her
generals
to
advance
and
the
entire
army
quickly
mounted
the
summit
of
the
ridge
and
ran
down
the
side
of
the
mountain
to
the
gates
of
the
city
the
people
who
saw
that
something
unusual
was
taking
place
greeted
bud
and
fluff
and
the
with
shouts
of
gladness
and
even
aunt
rivette
when
she
flew
down
among
them
was
given
three
hearty
cheers
but
there
was
no
time
for
joyous
demonstrations
while
the
streets
and
public
squares
were
cluttered
with
the
sleeping
bodies
of
the
terrible
the
army
of
ix
lost
no
time
in
carrying
out
their
queen
s
instructions
and
as
soon
as
they
entered
the
city
they
took
the
long
ropes
they
carried
and
wound
them
fast
about
the
round
bodies
of
the
monsters
securely
fastening
their
heads
and
limbs
into
their
forms
so
that
they
could
not
stick
them
out
again
their
enemies
being
thus
rendered
helpless
the
people
renewed
their
shouts
of
joy
and
gratitude
and
eagerly
assisted
the
soldiers
of
ix
in
rolling
all
the
outside
the
gates
and
to
a
wide
ledge
of
the
mountain
the
lord
high
general
and
all
the
other
counselors
threw
away
their
aprons
and
tools
of
servitude
and
dressed
themselves
in
their
official
robes
the
soldiers
of
tollydob
s
army
ran
for
their
swords
and
pikes
and
the
women
unlocked
their
doors
and
trooped
into
the
streets
of
nole
for
the
first
time
since
the
descent
of
the
monsters
illustration
all
the
were
thus
rolled
into
the
river
where
they
bobbed
up
and
down
in
the
but
the
task
of
liberation
was
not
yet
accomplished
all
the
had
to
be
rolled
up
the
side
of
the
mountain
to
the
topmost
ridge
and
so
great
was
the
bulk
of
their
bodies
that
it
took
five
or
six
men
to
roll
each
one
to
the
and
even
then
they
were
obliged
to
stop
frequently
to
rest
but
as
soon
as
they
got
a
to
the
ridge
they
gave
it
a
push
and
sent
it
bounding
down
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
until
it
fell
into
the
big
river
flowing
swiftly
below
during
the
afternoon
all
the
were
thus
dumped
into
the
river
where
they
bobbed
up
and
down
in
the
water
spinning
around
and
bumping
against
one
another
until
the
current
carried
them
out
of
sight
on
their
journey
to
the
sea
it
was
rumored
later
that
they
had
reached
an
uninhabited
island
where
they
harm
no
one
except
themselves
i

glad
they
floated
said
zixi
as
she
stood
upon
the
mountain
ridge
and
watched
the
last
of
the
monsters
float
out
of
sight
for
if
they
had
sunk
they
would
have
filled
up
the
river
there
were
so
many
of
it
was
evening
when
noland
at
last
became
free
from
her
terrible
tyrants
and
the
citizens
illuminated
the
entire
city
that
they
might
spend
the
night
in
feasting
and
rejoicing
over
their
freedom
the
soldiers
of
ix
were
embraced
and
made
much
of
and
at
all
the
feasts
they
were
the
honored
guests
while
the
people
of

pledged
them
their
sincere
friendship

took
possession
of
the
royal
palace
again
and
jikki
bustled
about
and
prepared
a
grand
banquet
for
the
king
s
guests
the
old
valet
grumbled
a
great
deal
because
his
six
solemn
servants
would
not
assist
in
waiting
upon
any
one
but
himself
the
had
destroyed
many
things
but
the
servants
of
the
palace
managed
to
quickly
clear
away
the
rubbish
and
to
decorate
the
handsomely
bud
placed
the
beautiful
upon
his
right
hand
and
showed
her
great
honor
for
he
was
really
very
grateful
for
her
assistance
in
rescuing
his
country
from
the
invaders
the
feasting
and
dancing
lasted
far
into
the
night
but
when
at

sought
their
beds
they
knew
they
might
rest
peacefully
and

the
returned
with
her
army
to
the
city
of

to
await
the
coming
of
the
sailorman
with
the
necktie
and
king
bud
set
about
getting
his
kingdom
into
running
order
again
the
lord
high
dug
up
his
magic
purse
and
bud
ordered
him
to
pay
the
shopkeepers
full
value
for
everything
the
had
destroyed
the
merchants
were
thus
enabled
to
make
purchases
of
new
stocks
of
goods
and
although
all
travelers
had
for
many
days
kept
away
from
noland
for
fear
of
the
monsters
caravans
now
flocked
in
vast
numbers
to
the
city
of
nole
with
rich
stores
of
merchandise
to
sell
so
that
soon
the
entire
city
looked
like
a
huge
bazaar
bud
also
ordered
a
gold
piece
given
to
the
head
of
every
family
and
this
did
no
damage
to
the
royal
purse
while
it
meant
riches
to
the
poor
people
who
had
suffered
so
much
princess
fluff
had
carried
her
silver
chest
back
to
the
palace
of
her
brother
and
in
it
lay
carefully
folded
the
magic
cloak
being
now
fearful
of
losing
it
she
warned
jikki
to
allow
no
one
to
enter
the
room
in
which
lay
the
silver
chest
except
with
her
full
consent
explaining
to
him
the
value
of
the
cloak
and
was
it
this
cloak
i
wore
when
i
wished
for
half
a
dozen
servants
asked
the
old
valet
yes
answered
fluff
aunt
rivette
bade
you
return
it
to
me
and
you
were
so
careless
of
it
that
nearly
all
the
high
counselors
used
it
before
i
found
it
then
said
jikki
heedless
of
the
reproof
will
your
highness
please
use
the
cloak
to
rid
me
of
these
stupid
servants
they
are
continually
at
my
heels
waiting
to
serve
me
and
i
am
so
busy
myself
serving
others
that
those
six
young
men
almost
drive
me
distracted
it
wouldn
t
be
so
bad
if
they
would
serve
any
one
else
but
they
claim
they
are
my
servants
alone
and
refuse
to
wait
upon
even
his
majesty
the
sometime
i
will
try
to
help
you
answered
fluff
but
i
shall
not
use
the
cloak
again
until
the
miller
s
son
returns
from
his
voyage
at
so
jikki
was
forced
to
wait
as
impatiently
as
the
others
for
the
sailorman
and
his
servants
had
now
become
such
a
burden
upon
him
that
he
grumbled
every
time
he
looked
around
and
saw
them
standing
in
a
stiff
line
behind
him
aunt
rivette
again
took
possession
of
her
rooms
at
the
top
of
the
palace
and
although
bud
grateful
for
her
courage
in
saving
him
and
his
sister
from
the
would
gladly
have
given
her
handsomer
apartments
the
old
woman
preferred
to
be
near
the
roof
where
she
could
take
flight
into
the
air
whenever
it
pleased
her
to
go
out
with
her
big
wings
and
her
power
to
fly
as
a
bird
she
was
the
envy
of
all
the
old
gossips
she
had
known
in
the
days
when
she
worked
as
a
laundress
and
now
she
would
often
alight
upon
the
of
some
humble
friend
and
tell
of
the
wonderful
adventures
she
had
encountered
this
never
failed
to
surround
her
with
an
admiring
circle
of
listeners
and
aunt
rivette
derived
far
more
pleasure
from
her
tattle
than
from
living
in
a
palace
with
her
nephew
the
king
the
kingdom
of
noland
soon
took
on
a
semblance
of
its
former
prosperity
and
the
were
only
remembered
with
shudders
of
repugnance
and
spoken
of
in
awed
whispers
and
so
the
days
wore
away
until
late
in
the
autumn
when
one
morning
a
mounted
soldier
from
queen
zixi
dashed
into
nole
and
rode
furiously
up
to
the
palace
gate
the
sailorman
is
found
he
shouted
throwing
himself
from
his
horse
and
bowing
low
before
little
king

who
had
come
out
to
meet
him
good
remarked

the
queen
of

is
even
now
riding
to
your

city
with
a
large
escort
surrounding
the
sailorman
continued
the
soldier
and
has
he
the
necktie
asked
bud
eagerly
he
is
wearing
it
your
majesty
answered
the
man
but
he
refuses
to
give
it
to
any
one
but
the
princess
that
s
all
right
said
the
king
and
reëntering
the
palace
he
ordered
jikki
to
make
preparations
to
receive
the
and
her
retinue

the
sailorman

when
zixi
came
to
the
city
gates
she
found
general
tollydob
in
a
gorgeous
new
uniform
waiting
to
escort
her
to
the
palace
the
houses
were
gay
with
flags
and
streamers
bands
were
playing
and
on
each
side
of
the
street
along
which
the
rode
were
lines
of
soldiers
to
keep
the
way
clear
of
the
crowding
populace
behind
the
queen
came
the
sailorman
carefully
guarded
by
zixi
s
most
trusted
soldiers
he
looked
uneasy
at
so
great
a
reception
and
rode
his
horse
as
awkwardly
as
a
sailor
might
so
the
cavalcade
came
to
the
palace
which
was
thronged
with
courtiers
and
ladies
in
waiting
zixi
and
the
sailorman
were
ushered
into
the
great
throne

where
king

magic
cloak
so
please
give
it
back
to
the
sailor
shifted
uneasily
from
one
foot
to
the
other
my
mother
told
me
he
finally
said
that
king
bud
would
give
me
fifty
gold
pieces
for
it
and
the
queen
of
ix
would
give
me
another
fifty
gold
pieces
and
that
your
highness
would
give
me
fifty
that
is
all
true
returned
fluff
so
here
are
the
fifty
tillydib
the
lord
high
counted
out
fifty
gold
pieces
and
zixi
s
treasurer
counted
out
another
fifty
and
all
were
given
to
the
sailorman
then
the
miller
s
son
unfastened
the
necktie
from
about
his
collar
and
handed
it
to
fluff
during
the
murmur
of
satisfaction
that
followed
the
girl
unlocked
her
silver
chest
which
jikki
had
brought
and
drew
out
the
magic
cloak
lifting
the
skirt
of
the
garment
she
attempted
to
fit
the
sailor
s
necktie
into
the
place
it
should
go
and
then
while
every
one
looked
on
with
breathless
interest
the
girl
lifted
a
white
face
to
the
sailorman
and
exclaimed
this
is
not
the
necktie
your
mother
gave
you
illustration
this
is
not
the
necktie
your
mother
gave
you
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
while
the
assemblage
glared
angrily
upon
the
sailor
then
the
king
rising
from
his
seat
demanded
are
you
sure
fluff
are
you
sure
of
that
of
course
i
m
sure
said
the
girl
it
is
neither
the
shape
nor
the
color
of
the
missing
bud
turned
to
the
now
trembling
sailor
why
have
you
tried
to
deceive
us
he
asked
sternly
oh
your
majesty
returned
the
man
wringing
his
hands
miserably
i
lost
the
necktie
in
a
gale
at
sea
for
i
knew
nothing
of
its
value
and
when
i
came
home
my
mother
told
me
of
all
the
gold
you
had
offered
for
its
return
and
advised
me
to
deceive
you
by
wearing
another
necktie
she
said
you
would
never
know
the
your
mother
is
a
foolish
woman
as
well
as
dishonest
answered
bud
and
you
shall
both
be
severely
punished
tellydeb
he
continued
addressing
the
lord
high
executioner
take
this
man
to
prison
and
see
that
he
is
fed
on
bread
and
water
until
further
not
so
exclaimed
a
sweet
voice
near
the
king
and
then
all
looked
up
to
see
the
beautiful
lulea
queen
of
the
fairies
standing
beside
the
throne
chapter
xxv
the
fairy
queen
every
eye
was
now
fixed
upon
the
exquisite
form
of
the
fairy
queen
which
shed
a
glorious
radiance
throughout
the
room
and
filled
every
heart
with
an
awe
and
admiration
not
unmingled
with
fear
the
magic
cloak
was
woven
by
my
band
said
the
fairy
speaking
so
distinctly
that
all
could
hear
the
words
and
our
object
was
to
bring
relief
to
suffering
to
add
to
their
worries
some
good
the
cloak
has
accomplished
i
am
sure
but
also
has
it
been
used
foolishly
and
to
no
serious
purpose
therefore
i
who
gave
the
cloak
shall
now
take
it
away
the
good
that
has
been
done
shall
remain
but
the
foolish
wishes
granted
shall
now
be
with
these
words
she
turned
and
lightly
lifted
the
shimmering
magic
garment
from
the
lap
of
the
princess

that

the

one
moment
please
cried
bud
eagerly
can
not
i
have
my
wish
i
waited
until
i
could
wish
wisely
you
know
and
then
the
cloak
wouldn
t
with
a
smile
lulea
threw
the
cloak
over
the
boy
s
shoulders

she

gravely
that
i
may

noland
has
ever
had
your
wish

granted
returned
the
fairy
sweetly
and
it
shall
be
the
last
wish
fulfilled
through
the
magic
but
now
zixi
rushed
forward
and
threw
herself
upon
her
knees
before
the
fairy
oh
your
she
began
eagerly
but
lulea
instantly
silenced
her
with
an
abrupt
gesture
plead
not
to
me
queen
of
ix
said
the
dainty
immortal
drawing
back
from
zixi
s
prostrate
form
you
know
that
we
fairies
do
not
approve
of
witchcraft
however
long
your
arts
may
permit
you
to
live
you
must
always
beware
a
mirror
zixi
gave
a
sob
and
buried
her
pretty
face
in
her
hands
and
it
was
fluff
whose
tender
heart
prompted
her
to
raise
the
and
try
to
comfort
her
for
a
moment
all
present
had
looked
at
zixi
when
their
eyes
again
sought
the
form
of
the
fairy
lulea
had
vanished
and
with
her
disappeared
forever
from
noland
the
magic
cloak
some
important
changes
had
been
wrought
through
the
visit
of
the
fairy
jikki
s
six
servants
were
gone
to
the
old
valet
s
great
delight
the
general
had
shrunken
to
six
feet
in
height
lulea
having
generously
refrained
from
reducing
old
tollydob
to
his
former
short
stature
ruffles
to
the
grief
of
the
lord
high
steward
could
no
longer
talk
but
tallydab
comforted
himself
with
the
knowledge
that
his
dog
could
at
least
understand
every
word
addressed
to
him
the
lord
high
executioner
found
he
could
no
longer
reach
farther
than
other
men
but
the
royal
purse
of
old
tillydib
remained
ever
filled
which
assured
the
future
prosperity
of
the
kingdom
of
noland
as
for
zixi
she
soon
became
reconciled
to
her
fate
and
returned
to
ix
to
govern
her
country
with
her
former
liberality
and
justice
the
last
wish
granted
by
the
magic
cloak
was
doubtless
the
most
beneficial
and
of
all
for
king
bud
ruled
many
years
with
exceeding
wisdom
and
gentleness
and
was
greatly
beloved
by
each
and
every
one
of
his
admiring
subjects
the
cheerfulness
and
sweet
disposition
of
princess
fluff
became
renowned
throughout
the
world
and
when
she
grew
to
womanhood
many
brave
and
handsome
princes
from
other
countries
came
to
nole
to
sue
for
her
heart
and
hand
one
of
these
she
married
and
reigned
as
queen
of
a
great
nation
in
after
years
winning
quite
as
much
love
and
respect
from
her
people
as
his
loyal
subjects
bestowed
upon
her
famous
brother
