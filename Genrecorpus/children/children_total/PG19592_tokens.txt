jasper
victory
a
dozen
boys
were
playing
ball
in
a
field
adjoining
the
of
pericles
benton
in
the
town
of
walltham
a
hundred
and
miles
northeast
of
the
city
of
new
york
these
boys
varied
in
age
from
thirteen
to
seventeen
in
another
part
of
the
field
a
few
younger
boys
were
amusing
themselves
all
these
boys
were
connected
with
the
school
the
ball
had
been
knocked
to
a
distance
by
the
batter
and
it
was
the
duty
of
nicholas
thorne
one
of
the
oldest
boys
to
ran
after
it
but
he
thought
of
an
easier
way
cameron
run
for
that
ball
he
cried
addressing
one
of
the
smaller
boys
outside
the
game
i
do
want
to
said
little
cameron
did
you
hear
what
i
said
demanded
thorne
imperiously
yes
then
you
better
go
if
you
know
what
best
for
yourself
said
the
bully
frowning
i
ai
in
the
game
said
cameron
why
should
i
get
the
ball
because
i
say
so
retorted
the
tyrant
run
after
it
yourself
thorne
said
a
lad
named
davies
it
your
business
not
cameron
it
his
business
because
i
ordered
him
to
do
it
said
thorne
flushed
and
angry
do
you
think
i
will
allow
him
to
bully
me
the
boot
on
the
other
leg
said
davies
dryly
run
after
the
ball
and
do
keep
the
game
waiting
that
so
said
half
a
dozen
voices
let
cameron
alone
i
wo
let
him
alone
said
thorne
who
had
by
this
time
worked
himself
into
a
towering
passion
i
give
him
the
worst
flogging
he
ever
had
if
he
does
obey
me
so
saying
he
advanced
toward
cameron
in
a
menacing
manner
thorne
was
the
acknowledged
bully
of
the
school
he
was
a
big
hulking
fellow
with
a
heavy
figure
and
a
repulsive
face
and
small
ferret
eyes
emitting
a
cold
and
baleful
light
he
was
more
than
a
match
for
any
of
his
and
availed
himself
of
his
superior
physical
strength
to
abuse
and
browbeat
the
smaller
boys
knowing
his
strength
he
was
not
afraid
of
interference
and
usually
carried
his
point
if
cameron
had
not
been
particularly
occupied
playing
marbles
with
a
boy
of
his
own
age
he
would
not
have
ventured
to
object
to
obey
the
despot
when
he
saw
thorne
advancing
toward
him
with
a
cruel
light
in
his
eyes
he
became
frightened
and
said
hurriedly
do
pound
me
thorne
i
go
yes
said
thorne
between
his
teeth
you
go
but
you
ought
to
have
done
so
at
first
i
give
you
something
to
remind
you
to
be
more
prompt
next
time
do
hit
me
thorne
pleaded
the
little
boy
with
tears
in
his
eyes
i
going
shame
thorne
exclaimed
davies
thorne
glared
at
davies
wrathfully
take
care
how
you
talk
he
said
or
it
be
your
turn
next
davies
was
two
inches
shorter
than
thorne
and
by
no
means
his
equal
so
honestly
indignant
as
he
was
he
did
venture
to
say
any
more
little
cameron
turned
to
run
despairing
of
help
and
thorne
started
to
pursue
him
of
course
there
was
no
chance
of
the
smaller
boy
escape
or
would
not
have
been
but
for
an
unexpected
incident
stop
was
heard
in
a
clear
commanding
voice
thorne
turned
in
surprise
what
boy
for
it
was
a
boy
voice
had
dared
to
command
him
to
atop
he
was
long
in
doubt
jasper
kent
a
new
scholar
who
had
only
arrived
the
day
before
advanced
intrepidly
to
the
rescue
of
the
little
victim
he
was
an
inch
shorter
than
thorne
of
a
slight
elegant
build
with
a
clear
complexion
and
a
bright
attractive
face
that
would
have
been
pronounced
handsome
by
anyone
judging
from
outward
appearances
no
one
would
have
thought
him
the
equal
of
thorne
in
strength
when
nicholas
thorne
eye
lighted
on
his
antagonist
his
lip
turned
in
scorn
and
he
paused
you
the
new
boy
i
believe
he
said
yes
i
thought
so
if
you
had
been
here
longer
you
would
know
better
than
to
interfere
with
me
this
was
spoken
with
the
utmost
arrogance
you
appear
to
consider
yourself
master
here
said
jasper
quietly
i
am
master
here
returned
nicholas
in
the
same
tone
and
you
claim
the
right
of
ordering
around
smaller
boys
i
do
and
of
beating
them
if
they
dare
to
disobey
your
majesty
commands
i
suppose
continued
jasper
with
sarcasm
yes
i
do
have
you
anything
to
say
about
it
exclaimed
the
young
despot
in
a
swaggering
manner
yes
i
have
was
the
quiet
answer
what
have
you
got
to
say
i
should
like
to
know
that
i
wo
allow
it
said
jasper
you
wo
allow
it
exclaimed
thorne
bursting
into
a
brutal
laugh
and
who
are
you
young
poppinjay
my
name
is
jasper
kent
at
your
service
then
jasper
kent
i
beg
leave
to
suggest
that
you
mind
your
own
business
i
generally
do
said
jasper
coolly
but
that
advice
comes
with
a
bad
grace
from
you
why
does
it
because
you
are
not
attending
to
your
business
what
is
my
business
demanded
thorne
angrily
to
go
after
that
ball
it
cameron
business
i
ordered
him
to
go
after
it
and
i
order
him
not
to
go
for
it
said
jasper
resolutely
but
without
excitement
thorne
answered
with
an
oath
i
a
great
mind
to
send
you
for
it
he
exclaimed
his
small
eyes
glaring
at
his
opponent
it
one
thing
to
order
and
another
to
secure
obedience
said
jasper
your
turn
will
come
growled
thorne
but
just
at
present
i
got
cameron
case
to
dispose
of
cameron
go
for
that
ball
the
little
boy
started
but
his
purpose
was
interrupted
jasper
kent
hurried
forward
and
placed
his
hand
kindly
on
his
shoulder
do
go
cameron
he
said
i
protect
you
cameron
stopped
but
looked
apprehensively
at
thorne
he
evidently
doubted
the
power
of
his
young
protector
thorne
was
now
thoroughly
exasperated
his
authority
was
openly
defied
he
rushed
at
jasper
intending
to
overwhelm
him
by
the
suddenness
and
momentum
of
his
attack
but
jasper
was
prepared
for
him
he
turned
swiftly
aside
and
planted
a
blow
on
thorne
right
ear
which
sent
him
staggering
to
the
earth
the
bully
was
astonished
but
rallied
almost
foaming
at
the
mouth
with
rage
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
renewed
the
attack
he
attempted
to
throw
his
arms
round
the
waist
of
jasper
and
throw
him
had
his
tactics
been
successful
probably
jasper
would
have
been
borne
to
the
earth
by
the
superior
weight
of
his
opponent
but
here
again
he
was
prepared
he
stepped
back
and
received
thorne
with
a
blow
on
his
breast
so
firmly
planted
that
he
staggered
again
by
this
time
he
had
lost
all
control
of
himself
and
was
thoroughly
under
the
dominion
of
passion
he
pitched
into
jasper
trying
to
get
in
a
blow
wherever
he
could
and
in
so
doing
exposed
himself
to
the
skilful
blows
of
his
slighter
foe
who
had
some
knowledge
of
boxing
while
thorne
had
none
whatever
finally
thorne
was
stretched
on
his
back
not
immediately
to
rise
have
you
had
enough
asked
jasper
bending
over
him
i
kill
you
shrieked
thorne
wail
till
you
are
able
said
jasper
thorne
struggled
to
rise
jasper
held
him
down
forcibly
you
will
stay
there
till
you
promise
to
let
cameron
alone
he
said
i
wo
promise
then
you
stay
where
you
are
but
at
that
moment
a
small
boy
came
across
the
field
from
the
school
thorne
is
wanted
he
said
there
a
lady
to
see
him
you
can
rise
then
said
jasper
thorne
rose
sullenly
and
without
a
word
strode
toward
the
large
square
building
with
an
extended
wing
which
was
used
for
the
little
cameron
seized
jasper
hand
and
kissed
it
how
brave
you
are
he
said
how
much
i
thank
you
oh
it
nothing
said
jasper
modestly
you
just
send
for
me
when
you
in
trouble
cameron
i
wo
let
him
hurt
you
chapter
ii
strange
news
entering
the
house
thorne
reported
at
the
doctor
study
his
flushed
appearance
attracted
the
teacher
attention
what
the
matter
thorne
he
asked
the
new
boy
pitched
into
me
and
i
licked
him
said
thorne
but
his
sullen
manner
was
so
unlike
that
of
a
victor
that
the
doctor
shrewdly
suspected
that
his
statement
was
not
wholly
correct
what
was
the
quarrel
about
he
asked
we
were
playing
ball
said
thorne
evasively
i
will
inquire
into
it
at
present
you
are
wanted
in
the
parlor
so
thorne
left
the
presence
of
the
principal
and
entered
the
opposite
room
a
lady
seated
on
a
sofa
arose
quickly
and
advanced
to
meet
him
she
kissed
the
boy
cheek
to
which
he
submitted
without
manifesting
any
responsive
feeling
how
long
it
is
since
i
saw
you
nicholas
my
dear
boy
she
said
it
only
about
six
months
said
nicholas
stolidly
and
are
not
six
months
long
for
a
mother
to
be
separated
from
her
only
child
said
the
lady
tenderly
it
does
seem
so
long
said
nicholas
the
lady
looked
pained
but
she
proceeded
how
you
have
grown
yes
i
grown
said
nicholas
showing
a
little
pleasure
now
i
think
i
shall
be
a
large
man
like
your
father
and
how
are
you
improving
in
your
studies
nicholas
oh
i
doing
well
enough
said
the
boy
indifferently
for
nicholas
thorne
taste
for
study
was
very
moderate
did
you
bring
me
any
money
mother
you
have
your
regular
allowance
nicholas
it
is
enough
what
a
dollar
a
week
it
is
a
good
deal
for
me
to
pay
said
his
mother
remember
i
have
to
pay
your
school
bills
and
my
means
are
but
small
a
dollar
a
week
is
very
small
for
a
boy
of
my
age
grumbled
thorne
why
some
of
the
little
boys
get
more
and
there
that
new
boy
jasper
kent
gets
five
dollars
so
they
say
the
lady
betrayed
strong
interest
at
the
sound
of
his
name
i
forgot
she
said
so
jasper
kent
has
arrived
has
he
what
mother
do
you
know
him
demanded
thorne
surprised
in
turn
yea
i
know
him
what
do
you
think
of
him
think
of
him
i
hate
him
said
thorne
fiercely
why
he
tries
to
bully
me
and
you
permit
it
why
you
are
larger
than
he
yes
but
he
knows
how
to
fight
how
do
you
know
i
had
a
fight
with
him
this
morning
said
nicholas
did
he
come
off
best
asked
the
lady
no
answered
nicholas
with
hesitation
that
is
we
were
only
half
through
the
fight
when
a
boy
ran
up
and
said
you
had
come
so
we
had
to
stop
humph
that
is
strange
said
the
lady
in
a
low
voice
more
to
herself
than
to
her
son
this
sudden
antagonism
what
do
you
know
about
kent
demanded
nicholas
his
curiosity
aroused
perhaps
i
may
as
well
tell
you
said
his
mother
thoughtfully
but
i
wish
you
to
keep
the
matter
secret
from
him
you
wo
catch
me
telling
him
anything
except
that
he
is
a
scoundrel
muttered
nicholas
then
sit
down
by
me
and
i
will
tell
you
much
that
you
do
not
know
but
ought
now
to
hear
is
the
door
shut
yes
go
and
see
it
is
important
that
no
one
should
overhear
us
nicholas
complied
with
her
request
it
shut
fast
enough
he
said
now
what
have
you
got
to
tell
me
to
begin
with
do
you
know
where
i
get
the
money
i
pay
for
your
schooling
and
clothes
my
father
left
you
some
money
did
he
he
left
me
a
small
property
which
rents
for
two
hundred
dollars
a
year
you
pay
three
hundred
a
year
for
me
do
you
for
your
school
bills
yes
besides
i
give
you
an
allowance
and
buy
your
clothes
how
do
you
do
it
asked
nicholas
in
surprise
have
you
sold
the
house
no
if
i
should
do
that
there
would
soon
be
nothing
left
that
was
the
problem
i
had
to
solve
three
years
ago
when
your
father
died
what
did
you
do
i
felt
that
the
property
must
not
be
touched
save
the
income
i
saw
that
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
exert
myself
or
i
should
be
unable
to
educate
you
as
i
desired
i
had
a
good
education
and
i
determined
to
avail
myself
of
it
i
therefore
went
to
a
teacher
agency
in
new
york
and
set
forth
my
desire
to
obtain
the
position
of
governess
in
some
family
in
the
country
you
a
governess
why
not
it
was
the
only
way
i
could
think
of
that
would
yield
me
an
income
after
waiting
a
few
weeks
i
succeeded
a
wealthy
gentleman
living
in
a
country
town
of
moderate
size
saw
my
testimonials
was
pleased
with
them
and
engaged
me
to
superintend
the
education
of
an
orphan
niece
resident
in
his
family
he
offered
me
a
fair
salary
enough
added
to
the
rent
which
i
received
from
the
property
left
me
by
your
father
to
justify
me
in
putting
you
at
this
that
was
three
years
ago
why
did
you
tell
me
all
this
before
mother
it
would
have
done
no
good
i
preferred
that
you
should
think
of
me
as
possessing
an
independent
property
i
felt
that
it
would
enable
you
the
better
to
hold
up
your
head
among
your
as
they
could
know
nothing
of
your
antecedents
does
benton
know
this
asked
nicholas
quickly
no
he
only
knows
that
i
am
a
widow
he
supposes
that
i
have
sufficient
means
i
am
glad
of
that
would
it
make
any
difference
with
him
i
do
know
any
way
i
rather
he
would
know
it
nicholas
thorne
sat
by
his
mother
side
thoughtful
he
was
disappointed
to
think
that
his
mother
means
were
so
limited
since
it
curtailed
his
future
expectations
the
thought
of
that
mother
working
patiently
to
defray
his
expenses
at
school
made
comparatively
little
impression
he
was
essentially
selfish
and
so
long
as
his
wants
were
provided
for
he
cared
little
who
labored
for
him
you
do
ask
the
name
of
the
man
who
employs
me
said
his
mother
nicholas
looked
up
i
suppose
it
is
nobody
i
ever
heard
of
he
said
no
you
never
heard
of
him
but
you
know
some
one
connected
with
him
what
do
you
mean
asked
the
boy
his
curiosity
aroused
the
gentleman
who
employs
me
is
father
of
one
of
your
schoolmates
father
of
one
of
my
yes
who
is
it
why
do
you
tell
me
mother
you
have
spoken
of
him
to
me
this
morning
it
is
jasper
kent
you
work
for
jasper
kent
father
exclaimed
nicholas
in
unbounded
astonishment
does
he
know
it
yes
he
knows
that
i
am
or
have
been
governess
in
his
family
but
he
knows
nothing
of
my
connection
with
you
if
he
knew
he
taunt
me
with
my
mother
being
obliged
to
work
for
a
living
said
thorne

do
think

any
rate
the
time

coming
very
soon
when
he
will
have
no
advantage
over
you
how
do

out

poor
health
too
she
added
significantly

nicholas
with
satisfaction

how

cards

the
mother
smiled
my
days
of
dependence

to
an
end

said

time

you

chapter
iii
jasper
recognizes
the
visitor
will
the
old
man
do
anything
for
me
after
he
marries
you
mother
asked
nicholas
who
never
failed
to
look
out
for
his
own
interests
he
does
know
you
are
in
existence
nicholas
did
you
never
speak
to
him
of
me
no
i
did
dare
to
tell
him
why
not
it
might
prevent
his
marrying
me
it
seems
to
me
grumbled
nicholas
you
only
thought
of
yourself
you
did
care
what
became
of
me
that
is
unjust
nicholas
you
must
see
that
it
is
once
we
are
married
i
shall
have
more
control
of
money
and
if
kent
dies
i
shall
be
entitled
to
a
third
of
his
property
i
wish
he
leave
you
the
whole
and
cut
off
that
upstart
jasper
said
nicholas
frowning
there
is
not
much
chance
of
that
he
thinks
everything
of
jasper
however
i
do
think
he
live
long
and
i
shall
induce
him
if
possible
to
name
me
as
jasper
guardian
that
would
be
a
good
job
for
you
mother
not
so
good
for
jasper
thinking
you
are
right
nicholas
did
you
say
you
disliked
him
yes
i
hate
him
so
do
i
said
his
mother
in
a
low
tone
but
one
of
intense
energy
why
asked
thorne
in
some
curiosity
i
tell
you
from
my
entrance
into
his
father
family
he
has
never
treated
me
with
any
cordiality
evidently
he
did
like
me
i
think
indeed
he
mistrusted
me
though
i
never
gave
occasion
for
any
suspicions
if
he
should
learn
now
that
i
am
to
marry
his
father
he
would
move
heaven
and
earth
to
prevent
the
marriage
has
he
been
home
much
since
you
were
in
the
house
no
he
was
at
school
elsewhere
and
was
only
at
home
during
his
vacations
how
did
he
come
to
be
sent
here
to
this
school
did
you
advise
it
no
i
was
opposed
to
it
but
kent
was
recommended
by
a
friend
to
send
his
son
here
i
did
not
venture
to
say
much
lest
i
should
be
asked
how
i
came
to
know
anything
of
the
school
i
was
afraid
you
and
he
would
meet
and
he
would
learn
the
connections
between
us
i
suppose
you
own
up
after
the
wedding
wo
you
i
think
not
at
once
nicholas
why
not
remember
what
i
told
you
that
kent
is
in
poor
health
he
may
not
live
six
months
we
can
keep
the
matter
secret
for
that
time
ca
we
nicholas
if
you
were
only
sure
he
would
die
in
that
time
he
has
heart
disease
and
is
liable
to
die
at
any
time
you
want
him
to
make
his
will
first
and
leave
you
guardian
of
course
after
that
you
would
mourn
very
much
for
his
loss
no
i
do
pretend
to
care
for
him
he
thinks
you
do
eh
mother
of
course
oh
you
a
deep
one
you
are
said
nicholas
winking
in
a
way
to
indicate
his
shrewd
insight
into
his
mother
motives
i
have
to
be
nicholas
there
no
getting
on
in
this
world
without
it
but
i
think
i
shall
have
to
leave
you
now
then
you
do
mean
to
invite
me
to
the
wedding
mother
it
will
be
a
private
ceremony
will
jasper
be
invited
his
father
was
anxious
to
have
him
at
home
indeed
i
have
had
a
great
deal
of
trouble
to
prevent
his
sending
for
him
but
at
length
i
have
succeeded
i
know
too
well
the
danger
the
boy
has
a
great
influence
over
his
father
whose
mind
is
weakened
with
his
body
and
i
should
be
afraid
that
the
match
would
be
broken
off
even
at
the
last
moment
if
the
boy
got
wind
of
our
plan
how
mad
jasper
will
be
when
he
hears
of
it
said
thorne
laughing
with
malicious
enjoyment
i
wish
i
could
tell
him
do
breathe
a
word
of
it
nicholas
said
his
mother
in
evident
alarm
oh
i
keep
the
secret
but
it
wo
do
any
harm
when
it
all
over
will
it
say
nothing
till
i
authorize
it
well
i
wo
then
if
i
can
help
it
but
i
say
mother
the
old
gentleman
will
come
down
handsomely
when
you
married
you
ought
to
raise
my
allowance
to
two
dollars
a
week
i
will
if
i
can
afford
it
said
his
mother
but
i
must
leave
you
now
nicholas
i
shall
have
about
time
to
go
to
the
station
and
meet
the
next
train
sha
i
go
with
you
i
should
like
your
company
my
dear
boy
but
we
must
be
prudent
we
might
meet
jasper
kent
that
so
well
nicholas
and
his
mother
pressed
her
lips
upon
the
cheek
of
her
son
he
tolerated
the
kiss
but
did
not
return
it
his
heart
was
not
very
impressible
and
he
cared
for
no
one
except
himself
i
wo
stop
to
see
benton
she
said
at
parting
you
may
tell
him
that
i
was
in
haste
all
right
thorne
emerged
from
the
parlor
and
from
the
house
she
was
tall
and
erect
in
figure
and
walked
rapidly
her
face
was
concealed
by
a
thick
veil
but
for
the
information
of
the
reader
it
may
be
described
as
narrow
and
long
with
small
eyes
like
those
of
nicholas
and
thin
lips
she
was
not
a
woman
to
yield
to
misfortune
or
give
way
to
sentimental
sorrow
she
looked
rather
like
one
who
knew
how
to
face
fortune
and
defy
it
it
was
not
a
pleasant
face
but
it
was
decidedly
a
strong
one
the
grounds
of
the
school
were
extensive
and
the
house
stood
back
two
or
three
hundred
yards
from
the
street
a
long
avenue
led
from
the
house
to
the
main
thoroughfare
thorne
looked
hurriedly
about
her
as
she
went
out
on
her
way
i
should
like
to
meet
jasper
kent
she
said
to
herself
it
might
lead
to
unpleasant
questions
and
suspicions
on
his
part
and
i
want
anything
to
happen
before
i
am
married
it
seemed
likely
that
she
would
escape
the
encounter
which
she
dreaded
had
there
been
no
interruption
or
delay
she
would
have
done
so
but
it
was
not
so
to
be
she
met
benton
in
front
of
the
house
and
was
compelled
to
stop
and
speak
to
him
you
find
nicholas
well
he
said
politely
oh
yes
doctor
she
answered
softly
i
have
no
anxiety
on
that
subject
as
long
as
he
is
under
your
care
i
know
that
he
can
not
fail
to
do
well
we
all
like
flattery
and
the
learned
principal
was
not
proof
against
it
ahem
thorne
he
said
pompously
we
try
to
do
our
duty
by
the
young
people
intrusted
to
our
charge
we
do
not
limit
our
endeavors
to
their
mental
culture
but
strive
to
promote
their
physical
also
and
you
succeed
remarkably
well
benton
but
you
must
excuse
my
leaving
you
abruptly
i
wish
to
catch
the
next
train
i
hope
we
shall
see
you
again
soon
madam
said
the
doctor
politely
i
shall
endeavor
to
call
again
before
many
weeks
benton
madam
thorne
adjusted
her
veil
and
swiftly
resumed
her
course
her
heart
gave
a
bound
when
just
outside
the
gate
she
espied
the
figure
of
jasper
kent
i
hope
he
wo
recognize
me
she
thought
but
she
forgot
her
peculiar
gait
and
the
quick
rapid
step
which
were
likely
to
identify
her
in
the
eyes
of
anyone
who
had
seen
her
often
jasper
kent
attention
was
drawn
to
her
and
he
observed
these
peculiarities
by
jove
he
said
to
himself
she
walks
just
like
the
governess
still
having
no
reason
to
suspect
the
presence
of
miss
thorne
as
he
called
her
at
the
school
he
would
have
thought
the
resemblance
only
accidental
but
for
a
whiff
of
wind
which
blew
the
veil
aside
from
her
face
that
face
there
was
no
mistaking
miss
thorne
he
exclaimed
in
surprise
advancing
to
meet
her
she
was
exceedingly
vexed
but
it
would
not
do
to
betray
it
jasper
she
said
with
a
smile
you
did
expect
to
see
me
here
no
did
you
come
to
see
me
is
my
father
unwell
he
asked
anxiously
your
father
is
quite
well
then
why
have
i
come
i
see
that
is
what
you
wish
to
ask
i
have
not
come
on
your
account
at
all
i
came
to
see
a
nephew
of
my
own
at
this
school
yes
you
must
mean
nicholas
thorne
yes
do
you
know
him
a
little
said
jasper
with
reserve
poor
fellow
he
has
neither
father
nor
mother
to
look
after
him
only
myself
i
am
his
only
relative
living
i
never
heard
you
speak
of
him
before
no
i
have
not
cared
to
intrude
my
private
concerns
upon
your
father
or
yourself
but
i
must
hurry
or
i
shall
be
late
at
the
station
have
you
any
message
to
send
to
your
father
give
him
my
love
and
tell
him
to
take
care
of
his
health
for
my
sake
i
hope
he
will
do
that
for
all
our
sakes
said
the
lady
with
affected
warmth
jasper
kent
looked
after
her
as
she
walked
rapidly
away
why
is
it
that
i
distrust
her
so
much
he
thought
to
himself
so
she
is
thorne
aunt
well
he
is
not
a
relation
to
be
proud
of
how
vexatious
that
i
should
meet
him
thought
thorne
i
ought
not
to
have
run
the
risk
of
coming
if
he
tells
nicholas
that
i
have
admitted
a
relationship
it
may
do
harm
once
the
wedding
is
over
i
shall
feel
more
secure
chapter
iv
thorne
revenge
the
unexpected
communication
which
thorne
had
received
from
his
mother
influenced
his
treatment
of
jasper
under
ordinary
circumstances
he
would
have
resented
bitterly
the
humiliating
defeat
he
had
received
at
the
hands
of
the
new
boy
now
however
he
felt
sure
of
ultimate
revenge
and
was
willing
to
bide
his
time
just
wait
till
his
father
is
dead
and
mother
is
his
guardian
he
said
to
himself
then
my
young
gentleman
your
pride
be
taken
down
see
if
it
ai
his
politic
forbearance
surprised
the
other
boys
who
did
not
understand
the
secret
cause
ai
you
goin
to
lick
that
new
boy
asked
tower
a
sycophantic
follower
of
thorne
what
for
asked
nicholas
because
he
licked
you
the
other
day
who
says
he
licked
me
demanded
the
young
tyrant
with
a
frown
why
all
the
boys
say
so
stammered
tower
do
you
say
so
demanded
nicholas
savagely
said
tower
timidly
lucky
you
do
said
thorne
significantly
i
lick
any
boy
that
tells
such
a
lie
about
me
tower
was
silent
the
fact
is
he
continued
in
a
milder
tone
we
were
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
fight
i
was
called
to
see
a
lady
visitor
but
for
that
i
should
have
licked
him
in
the
end
i
guess
you
can
lick
him
said
the
young
sycophant
of
course
i
can
said
nicholas
loftily
are
you
going
to
try
it
why
should
i
i
have
anything
against
him
we
came
out
even
the
use
of
bearing
malice
tower
was
astonished
to
hear
such
sentiments
from
thorne
it
did
not
sound
at
all
like
him
he
was
about
the
last
boy
who
would
be
singled
out
for
forbearance
or
forgiveness
of
injuries
so
the
younger
boy
concluded
that
his
leader
was
afraid
of
jasper
but
here
he
did
him
wrong
thorne
had
learned
to
respect
his
adversary
strength
and
skill
but
he
would
have
hazarded
a
second
encounter
but
for
the
prudential
reasons
already
suggested
for
the
present
he
thought
it
best
to
keep
quiet
jasper
also
had
made
a
discovery
though
as
we
know
the
information
he
had
received
was
not
correct
he
supposed
thorne
to
be
a
nephew
of
his
father
governess
whereas
she
was
his
mother
does
thorne
know
this
he
asked
himself
he
could
not
feel
quite
satisfied
on
this
point
nor
could
he
determine
precisely
how
far
his
feelings
were
affected
by
this
discovery
he
felt
a
dislike
toward
thorne
on
account
of
his
tyrannical
disposition
and
of
younger
boys
he
cherished
a
dislike
for
the
governess
the
cause
of
which
he
could
not
as
well
define
now
it
appeared
that
these
two
were
allied
to
each
other
i
beg
to
say
that
jasper
was
too
sensible
and
gentlemanly
to
dislike
the
governess
simply
because
she
was
poor
that
he
knew
very
well
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
substantial
worth
of
a
person
but
he
could
not
rid
himself
of
the
feeling
that
miss
thorne
residence
in
his
father
family
portended
misfortune
to
the
parent
whom
he
loved
so
well
so
a
week
passed
without
any
new
disturbance
or
outbreak
between
the
two
boys
jasper
had
been
on
the
lookout
fearing
that
thorne
would
take
some
opportunity
to
wreak
vengeance
on
young
cameron
when
he
was
not
present
but
his
fears
were
gradually
allayed
thorne
seemed
usually
peaceable
so
much
so
that
his
who
knew
him
well
thought
he
had
turned
over
a
new
leaf
and
speculated
as
to
what
had
produced
the
change
but
neither
boys
nor
men
change
suddenly
and
completely
though
policy
and
may
for
a
time
lead
them
to
suppress
the
manifestation
of
their
characteristic
traits
nine
days
after
the
fight
recorded
in
my
first
chapter
as
jasper
was
walking
in
the
davies
came
up
hurriedly
kent
he
said
you
wanted
who
wants
me
asked
jasper
is
it
dr
benton
no
the
doctor
absent
who
wants
me
then
little
cameron
what
is
thorne
at
him
again
asked
jasper
stopping
short
and
looking
toward
the
house
yes
thorne
at
his
old
business
bullying
him
he
took
the
opportunity
when
he
thought
you
were
out
of
hearing
i
must
stop
it
said
jasper
where
are
they
in
the
back
yard
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
fight
him
again
said
kent
regretfully
you
need
be
afraid
to
try
it
you
are
a
match
for
him
i
think
i
am
that
is
not
my
reason
what
then
i
do
like
fighting
it
brutal
besides
i
have
another
reason
which
i
do
care
to
mention
by
this
time
they
had
reached
the
scene
of
the
difficulty
little
cameron
was
and
thorne
stood
over
him
with
upraised
arm
do
as
i
tell
you
you
little
blackguard
he
was
just
saying
when
a
voice
he
well
knew
was
heard
calm
and
resolute
thorne
are
you
bullying
that
boy
again
nicholas
turned
and
saw
his
old
antagonist
he
was
sorry
to
see
him
but
he
could
not
well
withdraw
now
it
none
of
your
business
he
answered
sullenly
i
shall
make
it
my
business
to
protect
the
weak
said
jasper
quietly
you
may
need
to
protect
yourself
sneered
thorne
if
necessary
i
feel
competent
to
do
so
cameron
come
here
do
you
go
said
thorne
menacingly
the
little
boy
looked
in
terror
from
one
to
the
other
evidently
he
dreaded
that
the
immediate
result
of
his
obeying
kent
would
be
to
precipitate
a
blow
from
the
bully
jasper
saw
the
little
boy
quandary
and
he
quickly
advanced
to
the
rescue
throwing
one
arm
protectingly
round
cameron
waist
he
regarded
nicholas
firmly
well
he
said
what
do
you
propose
to
do
thorne
had
had
time
to
think
he
hated
jasper
worse
than
ever
but
he
knew
that
our
hero
did
not
care
for
blows
moreover
he
was
likely
to
give
back
better
than
he
received
there
was
another
way
of
wounding
him
which
prudence
would
have
led
him
to
hold
in
reserve
but
he
was
too
angry
to
be
prudent
moreover
he
had
had
a
note
two
days
before
from
his
mother
from
which
he
learned
that
the
wedding
was
to
be
solemnized
on
that
very
day
probably
at
that
moment
his
mother
was
kent
i
wo
fight
he
said
with
an
unpleasant
smile
seeing
relations
relations
repeated
jasper
with
a
look
of
surprise
and
inquiry
i
do
know
what
you
mean
you
know
soon
enough
said
thorne
mockingly
a
suspicion
of
the
truth
entered
jasper
mind
he
turned
pale
and
said
will
you
step
aside
with
me
thorne
and
tell
me
what
you
mean
if
you
like
said
thorne
indifferently
now
said
jasper
when
they
had
withdrawn
a
few
rods
from
the
other
boys
it
appears
you
have
heard
the
news
said
thorne
with
malicious
enjoyment
your
father
has
married
my
mother
that
makes
us
does
it
my
father
married
again
said
jasper
recoiling
as
if
he
had
received
a
blow
yes
strange
you
was
invited
to
the
wedding
is
it
an
hour
later
jasper
having
obtained
special
permission
from
benton
was
on
his
way
home
sick
with
apprehension
lest
this
threatened
misfortune
should
prove
real
chapter
jasper
return
home
his
father
married
again
and
he
left
in
ignorance
of
his
intention
jasper
felt
hurt
that
his
father
for
whom
he
cherished
so
deep
and
warm
an
affection
should
have
taken
such
a
step
without
apprising
him
of
it
in
advance
if
he
was
to
marry
certainly
his
only
son
ought
to
have
been
present
at
the
wedding
but
it
is
father
fault
he
thought
bitterly
it
the
fault
of
miss
thorne
she
is
more
artful
and
designing
even
than
i
thought
she
has
married
my
father
for
his
wealth
and
position
and
she
was
afraid
i
would
dissuade
him
from
such
a
step
it
was
certainly
a
bitter
thought
that
he
must
look
upon
this
woman
as
his
that
she
was
to
take
the
place
of
the
mother
whom
he
tenderly
remembered
though
six
years
had
passed
since
she
left
him
but
after
all
was
it
true
might
it
not
be
the
case
that
thorne
who
evidently
disliked
him
had
fabricated
the
story
in
order
to
annoy
him
there
was
a
gleam
of
comfort
in
this
and
he
felt
that
he
would
willingly
run
the
risk
of
being
laughed
at
for
having
started
on
a
chase
if
only
his
fears
could
be
relieved
but
after
all
there
was
the
possibility
nay
the
probability
considering
what
he
knew
of
miss
thorne
that
thorne
story
was
all
true
the
cars
stopped
for
a
brief
minute
at
the
depot
in
morton
destination
and
he
jumped
out
he
looked
eagerly
about
him
to
see
if
there
was
anyone
of
whom
he
could
ask
information
to
his
joy
he
caught
sight
of
john
a
in
his
father
employ
halloo
john
he
cried
give
me
a
hand
with
my
valise
why
master
jasper
returned
john
in
evident
surprise
i
did
know
you
were
coming
home
i
am
not
expected
said
jasper
i
came
at
a
moment
notice
you
too
late
for
the
wedding
master
jasper
for
the
wedding
repeated
jasper
his
heart
sinking
at
this
confirmation
of
his
worst
fears
yes
did
you
know
of
it
i
heard
something
but
not
much
tell
me
about
it
when
did
it
take
place
at
ten
this
morning
at
the
house
no
your
father
and
the
governess
walked
over
to
the
church
and
were
married
private
like
there
was
nobody
invited
but
we
were
all
surprised
that
you
did
come
to
it
i
knew
nothing
about
it
said
jasper
sadly
it
was
miss
thorne
doings
then
leastways
i
must
say
kent
now
i
know
it
john
my
father
would
not
have
treated
me
that
way
how
long
has
it
been
going
on
the
the
courtship
well
that
was
all
on
the
side
of
miss
thorne
thinkin
she
wheedled
your
father
into
marrying
her
i
wish
i
had
been
here
poor
man
he
felt
too
weak
to
resist
and
he
did
it
only
because
she
teased
him
i
can
take
my
oath
of
that
it
is
infamous
said
jasper
have
they
gone
away
no
they
ai
goin
i
heard
your
father
do
feel
able
to
travel
and
the
governess
i
mean
your
she
do
care
much
they
at
home
now
then
i
will
go
up
i
suppose
they
will
be
surprised
to
see
me
yes
they
will
but
your
father
be
glad
he
sets
the
world
by
you
master
jasper
i
believe
he
does
john
said
jasper
i
wish
i
could
have
saved
him
from
this
misfortune
it
too
late
now
entirely
you
are
right
i
do
know
but
it
might
be
best
for
me
to
turn
round
and
go
back
again
to
school
without
going
to
the
house
at
all
but
i
must
face
this
thing
and
see
for
myself
if
you
got
nothing
else
to
do
john
you
may
carry
my
valise
i
do
it
master
jasper
directly
you
go
up
to
the
house
and
be
there
in
a
jiffy
so
jasper
walked
thoughtfully
and
sadly
homeward
we
must
precede
him
in
a
sunny
on
the
sat
jasper
kent
father
in
a
luxurious
he
was
barely
fifty
but
evidently
a
chronic
invalid
his
constitution
had
been
undermined
years
before
by
a
residence
of
several
years
in
central
america
where
he
had
acquired
a
fortune
but
paid
a
costly
price
therefor
in
the
loss
of
his
health
for
years
he
had
done
no
business
other
than
to
take
care
of
his
property
which
was
amply
sufficient
to
enable
him
to
live
luxuriously
yet
he
did
not
find
the
time
hanging
heavily
upon
his
hands
of
a
studious
taste
he
had
surrounded
himself
with
books
and
pictures
he
received
regularly
a
new
york
daily
paper
and
the
leading
magazines
and
reviews
and
barring
his
and
occasional
seasons
of
pain
passed
his
time
in
a
placid
and
agreeable
manner
circumstances
perhaps
had
fostered
a
disposition
to
indolence
and
made
it
more
difficult
to
resist
the
artful
schemes
of
miss
thorne
whom
he
had
admitted
into
the
house
as
governess
of
his
little
niece
florence
grantley
but
who
had
from
the
first
cherished
the
ambitious
design
of
making
herself
mistress
of
the
establishment
it
is
needless
to
recapitulate
the
steps
she
took
in
this
direction
it
is
enough
to
chronicle
her
ultimate
success
we
introduce
the
pair
as
they
sit
conversing
in
the
pleasant
already
referred
to
i
think
jasper
ought
to
be
at
once
informed
of
our
marriage
said
kent
there
is
no
need
of
haste
in
my
opinion
my
dear
said
kent
indeed
he
ought
to
have
been
present
at
the
ceremony
i
am
afraid
the
poor
boy
will
feel
hurt
that
i
should
have
left
him
wholly
in
the
dark
kent
lip
curled
evidently
she
had
no
particular
feeling
for
the
poor
boy
lay
the
whole
blame
upon
me
kent
she
said
it
was
i
who
advised
it
and
i
am
willing
to
take
the
responsibility
i
know
you
advised
it
my
dear
said
kent
to
whom
this
phrase
was
yet
new
but
i
could
not
understand
why
i
will
explain
and
i
think
you
will
consider
my
explanation
a
good
one
it
would
have
taken
jasper
attention
from
his
studies
and
it
might
have
been
some
time
before
he
would
have
been
able
to
resume
them
to
advantage
that
may
be
but
still
on
an
occasion
of
this
kind
if
the
ceremony
had
not
been
so
private
wholly
out
of
regard
to
your
health
of
course
he
should
have
been
recalled
as
it
is
it
is
better
on
all
accounts
not
to
disturb
him
did
i
tell
you
that
i
saw
him
last
week
saw
jasper
yes
was
he
here
why
did
i
not
see
him
asked
kent
in
surprise
it
was
not
here
that
i
saw
him
it
was
at
his
school
at
his
school
how
came
you
to
go
there
inquired
her
husband
in
still
greater
surprise
i
will
tell
you
though
i
have
hitherto
kept
it
a
secret
as
a
matter
of
my
own
now
since
i
am
your
wife
it
is
only
proper
that
i
should
acquaint
you
with
it
i
have
a
nephew
at
the
same
school
you
have
a
nephew
at
benton
yes
answered
kent
lowering
her
voice
to
a
compassionate
inflection
poor
boy
he
has
neither
father
nor
mother
he
is
entirely
dependent
upon
me
out
of
my
salary
i
have
paid
his
expenses
ever
since
i
entered
your
employ
that
was
generous
and
kind
of
you
said
her
husband
approvingly
what
is
the
boy
name
nicholas
thorne
your
brother
son
i
suppose
said
kent
ye
es
she
replied
hesitatingly
what
is
his
age
sixteen
he
is
about
the
same
age
as
jasper
do
i
venture
too
much
in
asking
you
to
become
his
friend
kent
modulated
her
voice
as
she
well
knew
how
to
do
to
counterfeit
warm
and
tender
feeling
as
she
proffered
this
request
her
nature
was
feline
and
she
knew
how
to
conceal
her
claws
you
may
rely
upon
my
my
dear
said
kent
kindly
in
your
noble
task
there
was
a
latent
gleam
of
triumph
in
kent
eyes
as
she
heard
this
promise
which
transferred
to
her
husband
a
burden
which
had
long
been
a
drain
upon
her
own
slender
purse
she
had
dreaded
the
effect
of
this
announcement
upon
her
husband
and
finally
as
we
have
seen
thought
it
best
to
change
the
relationship
and
call
nicholas
her
nephew
and
not
her
son
so
that
difficulty
was
well
surmounted
and
the
effect
had
been
to
impress
kent
with
a
sense
of
her
generous
and
unselfish
devotion
but
her
exultation
was
a
bustle
was
heard
outside
an
instant
later
the
door
was
thrown
open
and
jasper
entered
the
room
flushed
and
excited
chapter
vi
the
jasper
exclaimed
his
father
in
surprise
but
showing
pleasure
nevertheless
at
his
son
unexpected
presence
the
boy
went
straight
up
to
his
father
passing
within
two
feet
of
his
father
wife
but
without
even
looking
at
her
father
he
burst
forth
impulsively
is
it
true
is
what
true
asked
his
father
embarrassed
for
he
guessed
what
jasper
meant
are
you
married
to
her
pointing
to
kent
who
looked
indignant
at
the
reference
yes
jasper
answered
his
father
nervously
shake
hands
with
your
with
mrs
kent
he
was
about
to
say
your
mother
but
something
in
his
memory
perhaps
something
in
his
son
face
led
him
to
change
the
expression
jasper
did
not
apparently
heed
the
suggestion
instead
he
said
reproachfully
why
was
it
father
that
you
left
me
in
ignorance
of
your
intention
she
thought
it
best
said
his
father
in
an
apologetic
tone
kent
spoke
for
the
first
time
yes
jasper
we
thought
it
would
only
interrupt
your
studies
jasper
could
not
help
a
slight
sneer
as
he
answered
you
were
very
considerate
madam
but
it
seems
to
me
that
such
an
important
event
in
my
father
life
would
justify
an
interruption
kent
repressed
her
real
feelings
of
anger
and
vexation
and
answered
mildly
and
with
an
affectation
of
good
humor
i
do
know
but
you
are
right
jasper
and
we
were
wrong
at
any
rate
since
you
have
come
it
is
a
pity
you
were
not
here
earlier
so
that
you
could
have
been
present
at
the
ceremony
it
was
quite
private
as
your
father
can
tell
you
yes
jasper
there
were
no
invitations
issued
said
his
father
i
wish
that
i
had
come
earlier
said
jasper
slowly
at
any
rate
now
that
you
are
here
said
kent
with
cordiality
for
it
was
politic
to
keep
on
good
terms
with
jasper
since
he
was
his
father
favorite
you
will
stay
a
day
or
two
you
forget
madam
the
interruption
to
my
studies
said
jasper
i
should
like
to
wring
the
boy
neck
thought
kent
her
eyes
contracting
slightly
but
she
answered
amiably
i
am
afraid
i
have
thought
too
much
of
that
already
let
me
make
amends
by
welcoming
you
and
asking
you
to
stay
as
long
as
you
can
kent
nodded
approvingly
at
these
words
of
his
wife
i
ought
not
to
complain
said
jasper
since
you
treated
me
no
worse
than
you
did
your
own
son
nicholas
has
betrayed
my
secret
thought
kent
turning
pale
what
are
you
talking
about
jasper
demanded
kent
surprised
my
wife
has
no
son
jasper
means
my
nephew
explained
kent
recovering
her
assurance
he
said
you
were
his
mother
said
jasper
yes
said
kent
with
admirable
composure
the
poor
boy
has
always
looked
upon
me
as
a
mother
though
such
is
not
our
relationship
indeed
i
may
say
orphan
as
he
is
i
have
been
a
mother
to
him
and
it
is
very
much
to
your
credit
my
dear
said
kent
kindly
we
must
have
him
here
on
a
visit
as
jasper
schoolmate
and
your
nephew
he
shall
be
doubly
welcome
you
are
very
kind
kent
said
his
wife
in
a
tone
which
might
well
be
mistaken
for
that
of
grateful
emotion
it
will
indeed
be
a
treat
to
my
poor
nicholas
to
come
here
even
for
a
day
he
must
spend
his
next
vacation
here
eh
jasper
it
will
be
pleasant
for
you
to
have
a
boy
of
your
own
age
here
do
as
you
like
father
said
jasper
who
did
care
to
say
how
distasteful
the
proposition
was
to
him
or
to
explain
the
nature
of
the
relations
between
nicholas
and
himself
kent
looked
at
him
sharply
as
he
spoke
and
understood
better
how
he
felt
but
as
he
did
not
openly
object
she
was
satisfied
it
was
what
she
had
wished
to
bring
about
and
she
felt
pleased
that
the
proposal
had
come
from
kent
and
that
jasper
had
not
spoken
against
it
i
will
go
and
order
your
room
to
be
made
ready
for
you
jasper
she
said
you
had
better
write
to
benton
that
you
will
stay
with
us
a
day
or
two
so
saying
she
left
the
room
and
jasper
was
left
alone
with
his
father
do
you
like
this
marriage
jasper
asked
his
father
anxiously
seeing
that
his
son
looked
sober
no
father
answered
jasper
frankly
i
have
not
yet
got
over
the
shock
of
the
first
news
you
think
i
ought
to
have
told
you
about
it
you
are
not
accustomed
to
keep
secrets
from
me
father
i
did
it
for
the
best
jasper
i
wanted
to
tell
you
but
she
kent
thought
it
best
not
i
am
afraid
father
said
jasper
sadly
it
will
not
be
the
only
time
that
she
is
destined
to
come
between
us
no
jasper
answered
his
father
with
more
energy
than
was
usual
with
him
that
shall
not
be
i
am
sure
she
would
not
wish
it
and
i
know
i
would
permit
it
i
hope
my
dear
boy
that
you
will
become
reconciled
to
the
new
state
of
things
one
thing
would
reconcile
me
to
it
said
jasper
what
is
it
to
be
assured
that
it
would
promote
your
happiness
i
feel
sure
that
it
will
said
kent
but
he
did
not
speak
very
confidently
if
it
be
so
it
is
all
i
ask
but
tell
me
father
did
you
marry
for
love
kent
hesitated
i
am
too
old
for
that
jasper
he
answered
pleasantly
the
fact
is
i
need
a
nurse
and
miss
thorne
needed
a
home
and
in
fact
without
pretending
to
any
sentimental
reason
we
concluded
that
it
would
be
the
best
thing
under
the
circumstances
was
she
very
much
surprised
when
you
made
the
proposal
father
asked
jasper
significantly
no
i
ca
say
she
was
answered
his
father
embarrassed
it
is
as
i
thought
jasper
said
to
himself
she
inveigled
my
father
into
the
marriage
he
said
aloud
well
father
i
heartily
hope
it
will
be
for
your
happiness
and
now
let
us
talk
about
something
else
shall
i
tell
you
about
the
school
yes
jasper
so
jasper
gossiped
about
school
matters
in
a
way
that
interested
his
father
and
the
two
forgot
for
a
time
that
a
new
tie
had
been
formed
that
might
possibly
make
a
difference
between
them
meanwhile
kent
instead
of
giving
directions
about
jasper
room
opened
her
and
wrote
a
hurried
note
to
nicholas
in
this
she
said
remember
nicholas
you
are
to
pass
for
my
nephew
why
were
you
so
imprudent
as
to
tell
jasper
i
was
your
mother
i
have
explained
that
you
regard
me
as
a
mother
though
really
my
nephew
you
must
give
the
same
explanation
jasper
is
at
home
now
not
very
well
pleased
to
find
that
he
has
a
but
it
is
done
and
he
will
find
it
ca
be
undone
be
prudent
follow
my
directions
implicitly
and
you
will
find
it
to
your
account
your
devoted
aunt
matilda
thorne
kent
i
have
told
kent
about
you
and
he
authorizes
me
to
invite
you
here
to
spend
the
next
vacation
chapter
vii
new
relations
jasper
remained
till
the
next
afternoon
his
father
urged
him
to
stay
longer
and
his
with
apparent
cordiality
seconded
the
invitation
but
jasper
felt
that
the
charm
of
home
was
gone
the
new
wife
had
stepped
in
between
his
father
and
himself
he
felt
sure
that
the
marriage
had
not
been
of
his
father
seeking
to
him
it
was
no
object
to
the
former
governess
it
was
a
matter
of
importance
since
it
secured
her
a
permanent
home
and
position
and
a
share
of
property
there
was
an
old
servant
in
the
family
a
trusty
maid
who
had
been
in
it
before
jasper
was
born
with
her
he
could
speak
confidentially
tell
me
margaret
he
asked
how
came
my
father
to
marry
miss
thorne
margaret
went
to
the
door
and
looked
out
cautiously
then
closed
it
i
do
want
her
to
hear
what
i
say
she
commenced
when
convinced
that
they
were
in
no
danger
of
listeners
but
it
my
belief
she
asked
your
father
to
marry
her
do
you
really
believe
that
margaret
yes
i
do
master
jasper
she
that
bold
she
would
mind
it
not
a
bit
only
she
do
it
i
know
just
how
she
do
it
she
tell
him
how
she
had
got
a
home
and
must
go
out
into
the
wide
world
and
get
him
to
pity
her
then
you
know
he
got
used
to
seeing
her
round
and
a
sick
man
do
like
changes
why
could
she
stay
as
governess
to
florence
according
to
her
father
will
florence
is
to
pass
the
next
four
years
in
the
family
of
his
sister
and
she
that
her
aunt
has
a
governess
for
her
own
children
that
do
for
florence
too
so
there
was
no
need
of
miss
thorne
staying
here
any
longer
your
father
asked
her
to
stay
a
while
till
she
could
find
another
place
it
my
belief
she
did
try
being
bent
on
staying
here
as
the
mistress
at
any
rate
she
told
your
father
she
could
get
a
place
and
he
offered
her
the
one
she
wanted
that
of
his
wife
how
do
you
like
her
margaret
asked
jasper
thoughtfully
me
like
her
that
what
i
never
did
she
like
a
cat
enough
when
she
has
her
own
way
but
she
got
claws
and
you
may
depend
she
show
i
hope
she
wo
do
anything
to
harm
you
master
jasper
me
said
jasper
with
the
bold
confidence
of
a
boy
laughing
at
the
thought
what
can
kent
a
woman
do
to
injure
me
i
risk
that
margaret
it
of
my
father
i
thinking
will
she
treat
him
well
i
think
she
will
for
it
her
object
to
master
jasper
she
married
him
for
money
you
know
i
do
mind
her
benefiting
by
my
father
property
if
she
will
make
him
comfortable
during
his
life
i
think
she
will
she
too
sly
and
knows
her
own
interest
too
well
not
to
i
glad
you
think
that
margaret
i
shall
feel
better
about
it
then
you
do
think
you
can
stay
jasper
said
kent
softly
when
he
announced
his
determination
no
madam
i
think
i
ought
to
be
getting
back
to
school
perhaps
you
are
right
we
shall
miss
you
yes
jasper
we
shall
miss
you
said
his
father
i
will
write
you
often
father
if
you
are
not
feeling
well
at
any
time
write
and
let
me
know
i
will
do
so
jasper
said
his
promptly
but
i
shall
have
better
news
to
write
your
father
shall
have
the
best
of
care
thank
you
madam
if
you
can
contribute
to
his
comfort
you
will
place
me
under
obligations
to
you
as
a
wife
it
will
be
my
duty
as
well
as
my
pleasure
to
do
so
said
kent
jasper
bowed
the
suggestion
of
the
relationship
always
fell
unpleasantly
on
his
ears
the
carriage
came
round
to
take
jasper
to
the
depot
his
father
and
looked
out
of
the
front
windows
and
saw
him
off
he
is
a
noble
boy
said
his
father
warmly
yes
said
kent
assenting
because
it
was
expected
manly
and
too
added
his
father
in
a
tone
full
of
affectionate
admiration
i
like
to
break
his
spirit
thought
kent
spitefully
some
time
i
may
have
the
chance
of
course
she
did
venture
to
say
this
she
only
inquired
were
you
like
him
at
his
age
mr
kent
kent
smiled
i
wo
flatter
myself
so
far
he
answered
jasper
is
an
improvement
on
the
parent
stock
i
see
in
him
more
manliness
and
than
i
possessed
at
his
age
may
it
not
be
parental
partiality
asked
kent
who
by
no
means
enjoyed
hearing
jasper
praises
no
i
do
think
so
you
must
let
me
believe
that
it
is
your
modesty
then
jasper
may
be
a
fine
boy
but
he
will
do
well
if
he
grows
up
as
good
a
man
as
you
now
you
flatter
me
my
dear
said
kent
smiling
you
have
too
good
an
opinion
of
me
i
do
know
about
that
said
kent
to
herself
i
think
you
are
an
old
fool
but
i
wo
say
so
aloud
she
said
with
a
smile
my
marrying
you
is
a
proof
of
my
good
opinion
mr
kent
thank
you
said
her
husband
politely
he
was
not
a
suspicious
man
far
from
it
but
even
he
knew
that
his
wife
only
married
him
for
a
home
and
an
establishment
but
he
never
let
his
mind
dwell
on
such
things
and
he
quietly
permitted
his
wife
assertion
to
go
uncontradicted
meanwhile
jasper
kent
had
returned
to
his
there
was
one
who
awaited
his
return
with
mingled
curiosity
and
exultation
this
was
nicholas
thorne
he
had
received
his
mother
letter
from
which
he
learned
first
that
her
plan
had
succeeded
and
she
was
now
the
wife
of
a
rich
man
and
secondly
that
his
own
relationship
to
her
must
be
changed
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
i
suppose
mother
knows
what
is
best
he
said
to
himself
so
i
to
be
her
nephew
am
i
well
it
all
one
to
me
as
long
as
i
fare
the
better
for
her
good
fortune
for
the
moment
it
occurred
to
him
that
his
mother
might
intend
to
throw
him
off
in
a
measure
but
he
quickly
laid
it
aside
bad
as
his
mother
was
she
was
yet
devoted
to
him
and
in
so
far
was
superior
to
him
for
he
cared
for
himself
first
and
for
no
one
second
the
thought
originated
in
his
own
base
selfishness
and
was
laid
aside
only
because
he
had
received
too
many
proof
of
his
mother
affection
to
doubt
her
when
he
heard
that
jasper
had
got
back
he
took
pains
to
meet
him
well
kent
he
said
with
a
show
of
intimacy
which
jasper
found
very
disagreeable
what
news
from
home
jasper
was
about
to
reply
abruptly
when
it
occurred
to
him
that
after
all
nicholas
had
an
interest
in
the
matter
i
suppose
you
mean
to
ask
if
your
mother
is
well
he
said
eyeing
jasper
keenly
but
nicholas
was
on
his
guard
his
mother
letter
had
cautioned
him
no
i
do
he
answered
impudently
she
is
your
mother
not
mine
my
mother
exclaimed
jasper
coloring
yes
she
your
father
wife
is
she
said
thorne
with
a
leer
yes
but
i
acknowledge
no
such
relationship
as
you
suggest
she
your
whatever
you
say
i
shall
never
call
her
so
you
told
me
before
i
went
that
she
was
your
mother
i
have
always
called
her
so
because
i
have
known
no
other
said
thorne
composedly
she
is
really
my
aunt
it
must
be
true
then
thought
jasper
however
it
is
of
little
importance
to
me
what
the
relationship
may
be
i
suppose
this
match
makes
us
relations
said
thorne
smiling
disagreeably
i
do
see
that
it
does
said
jasper
coldly
you
rather
it
would
i
suppose
sneered
thorne
provoked
i
do
know
you
well
enough
to
desire
so
close
a
connection
said
jasper
in
the
same
cold
tone
we
shall
know
each
other
well
enough
some
time
said
thorne
with
something
of
menace
in
his
tone
jasper
turned
on
his
heel
and
walked
away
chapter
viii
sudden
death
two
months
later
there
was
a
vacation
for
a
week
nicholas
expected
to
spend
this
with
his
mother
but
for
some
reason
kent
gave
him
no
invitation
probably
she
thought
that
nicholas
though
a
paragon
in
her
eyes
was
not
likely
to
win
favor
in
the
eyes
of
kent
his
rough
brutal
disposition
would
have
repelled
the
sick
man
who
had
become
gentle
in
his
enforced
seclusion
thorne
was
disappointed
but
his
disappointment
was
softened
by
a
timely
remittance
of
ten
dollars
from
his
mother
which
he
spent
partly
in
surreptitious
games
of
billiards
partly
in
overloading
his
stomach
with
pastry
and
nearly
making
himself
sick
jasper
spent
the
week
at
home
his
company
was
the
source
of
great
comfort
and
joy
to
his
father
and
this
repaid
him
for
the
intrusion
of
his
she
treated
him
with
politeness
and
apparent
cordiality
but
once
or
twice
when
he
chanced
to
look
up
unexpectedly
he
detected
her
eyes
fixed
upon
him
with
a
glance
that
seemed
to
express
detestation
on
these
occasions
her
expression
changed
instantly
and
she
addressed
him
in
a
soft
friendly
voice
all
this
puzzled
him
does
she
hate
me
or
not
he
asked
himself
i
certainly
do
like
her
still
i
shall
force
myself
to
treat
her
politely
as
long
as
she
treats
my
father
well
his
father
seldom
spoke
of
his
wife
to
his
son
but
sometimes
jasper
noticed
that
he
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
when
she
left
the
room
as
if
her
presence
had
been
a
restraint
upon
him
he
did
like
to
ask
his
father
any
question
directly
as
to
the
relations
between
them
he
hoped
that
at
least
they
did
not
add
to
his
father
discomfort
at
the
end
of
the
week
jasper
was
about
to
return
to
school
how
long
before
you
have
another
vacation
jasper
asked
his
father
wistfully
eleven
weeks
father
it
seems
a
long
time
jasper
i
can
come
home
during
that
time
to
my
mind
such
interruptions
of
study
are
bad
for
a
boy
said
kent
perhaps
they
are
assented
kent
reluctantly
i
wo
let
them
be
an
interruption
father
said
jasper
if
you
want
me
to
come
home
i
will
i
hope
jasper
you
will
understand
my
motive
for
speaking
said
kent
softly
i
should
really
be
glad
to
see
you
but
sometimes
we
have
to
sacrifice
our
own
inclinations
do
we
mr
kent
yes
my
dear
said
kent
listlessly
and
he
turned
his
eyes
once
more
to
jasper
who
had
his
overcoat
on
and
was
waiting
for
the
carriage
to
convey
him
to
the
depot
do
you
feel
as
well
as
usual
father
asked
jasper
anxiously
yes
i
do
know
but
i
do
perhaps
a
little
more
languid
but
that
is
not
unusual
well
father
if
you
want
to
see
me
at
any
time
write
a
line
and
i
come
at
once
thank
you
my
dear
boy
do
overwork
yourself
at
school
there
was
a
slight
smile
on
kent
thin
lips
jasper
noticed
and
mentally
resented
it
but
the
time
had
come
for
and
he
hurried
away
six
weeks
passed
jasper
heard
from
home
that
his
father
was
about
the
same
and
this
assurance
relieved
him
of
anxiety
still
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
spend
the
next
sunday
at
home
he
would
go
on
saturday
morning
and
come
back
on
monday
morning
and
he
knew
that
his
father
would
enjoy
even
this
brief
visit
but
he
was
destined
to
go
home
quicker
on
thursday
afternoon
a
boy
came
up
to
the
main
entrance
of
school
it
the
boy
from
the
telegraph
office
said
wilder
to
jasper
i
wonder
whether
he
got
a
message
for
the
doctor
or
one
of
us
boys
said
jasper
not
suspecting
that
it
was
for
himself
i
ask
said
wilder
here
you
boy
who
your
telegram
for
for
jasper
kent
said
the
boy
will
you
call
him
i
am
he
said
jasper
hurrying
forward
with
pale
face
and
beating
heart
for
a
telegram
always
inspires
fear
then
here
it
is
just
sign
the
book
said
the
boy
jasper
scrawled
his
name
hurriedly
and
tore
open
the
envelope
these
were
the
brief
words
of
the
dispatch
come
home
for
the
lord
sake
master
jasper
your
father
dying
margaret
bower
the
paper
swam
before
jasper
eyes
what
is
it
jasper
bad
news
asked
wilder
but
jasper
did
not
wait
to
answer
he
rushed
to
benton
office
got
his
permission
to
go
home
packed
his
valise
and
in
five
minutes
was
on
his
way
to
the
depot
he
was
just
in
time
for
the
afternoon
train
at
seven
in
the
evening
he
entered
the
avenue
that
led
to
his
father
house
throwing
open
the
front
door
he
met
margaret
in
the
hall
i
glad
you
here
master
jasper
said
the
faithful
handmaiden
heartily
is
it
too
late
i
hope
not
indeed
i
hope
not
jasper
waited
for
no
more
but
rushed
up
stairs
and
into
his
room
there
were
two
persons
there
the
and
a
man
of
thirty
with
black
whiskers
and
sallow
complexion
with
whom
she
was
talking
earnestly
they
started
when
jasper
entered
and
looked
discouraged
kent
looked
displeased
and
annoyed
how
is
my
father
exclaimed
jasper
excitedly
hush
he
is
very
low
said
kent
you
should
have
dashed
in
here
so
abruptly
is
there
no
hope
for
him
asked
the
boy
sorrowfully
no
my
young
friend
said
the
man
smoothly
all
has
been
done
that
human
skill
can
do
but
without
avail
are
you
the
doctor
i
am
where
is
graham
my
father
old
doctor
i
dismissed
him
said
his
he
was
not
competent
to
attend
so
critical
a
case
this
is
dr
kenyon
i
never
before
heard
graham
skill
doubted
said
jasper
is
my
father
conscious
no
he
is
under
the
influence
of
morphine
do
not
wake
him
up
was
he
then
in
great
pain
yes
in
great
pain
quietly
jasper
drew
near
the
bedside
his
father
lay
unconscious
his
form
rigid
his
face
thin
and
betraying
marks
of
weariness
and
suffering
the
tears
rose
to
the
eyes
of
jasper
as
he
realized
that
his
father
was
passing
away
as
he
looked
on
there
was
a
slight
convulsive
movement
then
repose
in
that
one
moment
his
father
had
passed
on
to
another
world
the
doctor
had
approached
the
bedside
also
and
he
too
saw
the
movement
he
is
dead
he
announced
dead
repeated
kent
in
a
voice
rather
of
surprise
than
of
sorrow
yes
well
she
said
coolly
we
must
all
die
we
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
we
have
done
all
we
could
do
to
preserve
his
life
certainly
my
dear
madam
you
may
comfort
yourself
by
that
thought
said
the
physician
why
did
you
not
send
for
me
before
asked
jasper
turning
with
moist
eyes
to
his
that
i
might
see
my
father
before
he
died
we
could
not
foresee
his
sudden
death
said
kent
how
do
you
happen
to
be
here
this
afternoon
did
you
direct
margaret
to
telegraph
for
me
asked
jasper
surprised
did
margaret
take
upon
herself
to
telegraph
to
you
asked
kent
in
a
tone
of
displeasure
yes
said
jasper
bitterly
did
you
mean
to
keep
me
wholly
unacquainted
with
my
father
illness
no
i
wrote
a
line
this
afternoon
which
i
should
have
sent
to
the
office
at
once
when
it
was
too
late
your
reproaches
are
unseemly
and
uncalled
for
said
his
quite
coldly
i
think
differently
said
jasper
bitterly
you
should
have
sent
for
me
as
soon
as
my
father
got
worse
than
usual
in
consideration
of
your
grief
i
will
overlook
your
impertinence
said
kent
compressing
her
thin
lips
as
she
left
the
room
the
doctor
followed
her
out
and
jasper
was
left
alone
with
the
dead
he
did
not
realize
it
but
his
father
death
was
to
seriously
affect
his
fortunes
chapter
ix
a
declaration
of
war
half
an
hour
later
jasper
left
the
room
where
his
father
lay
dead
he
did
not
seek
the
presence
of
his
who
he
felt
had
done
him
wrong
in
keeping
from
him
his
father
condition
he
went
instead
to
the
kitchen
where
he
found
margaret
this
is
a
sad
day
for
you
master
jasper
said
the
sympathizing
servant
it
is
indeed
margaret
i
have
lost
my
best
friend
true
for
you
but
for
your
telegram
i
should
not
have
known
even
now
that
he
was
dangerously
ill
i
thought
at
first
kent
asked
you
to
telegraph
no
she
did
i
asked
her
would
she
send
for
you
and
she
told
me
it
was
none
of
my
business
it
was
lucky
you
did
heed
her
said
jasper
she
is
a
cold
unfeeling
woman
that
she
is
master
jasper
assented
margaret
with
emphasis
how
long
has
my
father
been
so
sick
for
a
week
or
more
but
he
took
a
sudden
turn
at
the
last
i
think
he
got
worse
after
the
new
doctor
came
i
wanted
to
ask
you
about
that
why
was
graham
dismissed
he
has
attended
my
father
for
years
shall
i
tell
you
what
i
think
master
jasper
said
margaret
stopping
short
in
her
work
and
looking
mysterious
yes
let
me
whisper
it
then
come
nearer
master
jasper
rather
surprised
at
her
manner
jasper
obeyed
it
my
belief
she
whispered
that
your
did
want
your
father
to
get
well
jasper
looked
are
you
crazy
margaret
he
ejaculated
she
nodded
her
head
positively
i
know
what
i
saying
she
answered
but
what
can
make
you
believe
such
a
horrible
thing
he
asked
she
answered
in
the
same
low
voice
a
month
ago
she
got
your
father
to
make
his
will
what
there
is
in
it
i
do
know
but
it
is
likely
it
suits
her
after
that
she
had
nothing
to
gain
by
his
living
you
do
think
she
jasper
hesitated
to
proceed
poison
him
no
i
do
it
was
needful
but
your
papa
was
that
delicate
it
would
be
enough
if
he
was
not
rightly
treated
and
i
believe
this
new
doctor
did
the
right
thing
by
him
graham
and
kent
never
could
agree
but
she
and
the
new
doctor
have
been
as
thick
as
can
be
they
understand
one
another
i
be
bound
jasper
looked
shocked
and
was
silent
for
a
moment
i
do
like
kent
he
said
but
margaret
i
hope
you
wrong
in
this
that
any
one
could
wish
my
dear
gentle
father
dead
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
you
have
seen
as
much
of
your
as
i
have
master
jasper
heaven
grant
you
are
wrong
margaret
if
i
thought
it
were
true
i
should
never
want
to
look
at
the
woman
again
hush
said
margaret
suddenly
putting
her
hand
on
her
lip
jasper
understood
her
caution
when
he
saw
his
enter
the
kitchen
she
looked
from
one
to
the
other
with
a
suspicious
glance
this
is
a
strange
place
for
you
jasper
said
she
in
slow
cold
accents
i
do
see
why
madam
he
answered
in
a
voice
equally
cold
i
find
you
a
young
gentleman
conferring
with
a
servant
with
a
trusted
servant
who
has
been
in
our
family
for
years
nothing
could
be
more
natural
i
do
agree
with
you
said
kent
in
a
chilly
tone
i
am
unfortunate
in
not
winning
your
approbation
said
jasper
not
caring
to
suppress
the
sarcasm
it
strikes
me
you
are
impertinent
said
kent
she
had
thrown
off
the
mask
during
her
husband
life
she
had
taken
special
pains
to
be
polite
to
jasper
though
in
so
doing
she
did
violence
to
her
feelings
there
was
no
more
to
be
gained
by
it
and
she
had
changed
suddenly
jasper
could
not
help
alluding
to
it
how
happens
it
madam
he
said
that
your
treatment
of
me
has
changed
so
entirely
since
my
father
death
brief
as
the
interval
is
you
have
lost
no
time
there
was
hatred
in
the
glance
she
shot
at
him
i
was
silent
out
of
regard
to
your
father
who
was
blind
to
your
faults
she
answered
you
must
not
expect
me
to
be
equally
blind
i
do
madam
do
you
intend
to
remain
in
the
kitchen
demanded
kent
i
was
questioning
margaret
about
my
father
last
days
i
am
the
proper
one
to
question
would
you
have
afforded
me
the
information
i
desired
if
the
questions
you
asked
were
of
a
proper
character
kent
i
will
take
you
at
your
word
how
does
it
happen
that
you
dismissed
graham
my
father
old
family
physician
his
hesitated
and
looked
angry
but
she
replied
after
a
brief
pause
he
did
not
understand
the
case
what
makes
you
think
so
he
certainly
ought
to
understand
my
constitution
perhaps
he
ought
but
he
did
said
kent
sharply
you
have
given
any
reason
i
have
given
all
i
choose
i
do
mean
to
be
catechised
by
a
boy
who
is
this
kenyon
whom
you
called
in
afterward
a
very
skilful
physician
he
looks
young
he
has
a
high
reputation
when
did
he
assume
charge
of
my
father
case
a
week
ago
and
since
then
he
has
grown
steadily
worse
who
told
you
that
demanded
kent
sharply
is
it
not
true
did
margaret
tell
you
this
i
did
said
margaret
quietly
i
shall
remember
this
said
kent
spitefully
i
did
need
to
ask
margaret
said
jasper
when
my
father
lies
dead
after
a
week
treatment
by
this
skilful
physician
kent
was
white
with
anger
you
ought
to
know
that
life
and
death
are
in
the
power
of
no
doctor
she
said
for
angry
as
she
was
she
saw
that
it
was
necessary
to
reply
to
what
jasper
said
in
sending
for
kenyon
i
did
not
much
expect
that
he
would
cure
your
father
but
i
felt
that
it
was
my
duty
to
give
him
this
last
chance
unfortunately
he
was
too
far
gone
you
thought
that
matters
were
as
bad
as
that
a
week
ago
and
yet
you
did
send
for
me
exclaimed
jasper
it
would
have
done
no
good
said
she
coldly
but
it
would
have
been
a
satisfaction
to
me
to
see
something
of
him
in
his
last
sickness
kent
you
have
treated
me
right
in
this
matter
is
that
the
way
for
a
boy
to
talk
to
his
elder
yes
if
he
says
only
what
is
strictly
true
i
shall
not
continue
this
conversation
said
kent
haughtily
nor
shall
i
submit
to
be
talked
to
in
this
style
it
is
not
for
your
interest
to
make
me
your
enemy
she
added
significantly
jasper
was
frank
and
fearless
by
temperament
and
anything
in
the
shape
of
a
menace
roused
his
high
spirit
that
consideration
does
weigh
with
me
a
particle
he
said
hastily
we
will
see
she
retorted
and
with
a
look
of
anger
she
swept
from
the
room
margaret
said
jasper
abruptly
did
you
go
into
my
at
any
time
yes
master
jasper
did
you
ever
hear
my
father
inquire
after
me
i
heard
him
say
more
than
once
with
a
sigh
like
that
he
wished
to
see
you
and
she
would
send
for
me
exclaimed
jasper
bitterly
she
always
opposed
it
saying
it
would
do
no
good
and
would
only
take
you
off
your
studies
much
she
cared
for
my
studies
margaret
i
will
never
forgive
that
woman
never
well
i
ca
blame
you
master
jasper
here
margaret
heard
her
name
called
in
a
loud
voice
and
was
forced
to
obey
she
wants
to
separate
us
thought
jasper
as
he
slowly
and
sadly
went
up
to
his
own
chamber
chapter
nicholas
appears
upon
the
scene
the
funeral
was
over
kent
was
considered
by
those
present
to
display
a
great
deal
of
fortitude
as
she
felt
no
real
grief
for
the
death
of
her
husband
this
was
not
remarkable
jasper
looked
pale
and
sorrowful
but
gave
way
to
no
violent
demonstrations
of
sorrow
though
he
began
to
understand
that
he
had
not
only
lost
his
best
friend
but
become
at
the
same
time
exposed
to
the
machinations
of
a
resolute
and
relentless
enemy
in
due
time
the
will
was
read
it
was
very
brief
and
clear
in
its
provisions
to
kent
was
left
of
the
estate
real
and
personal
of
which
the
deceased
was
possessed
and
the
balance
was
willed
to
his
only
child
and
dear
son
jasper
of
whom
his
was
left
guardian
when
this
clause
was
read
kent
directed
a
brief
and
triumphant
glance
at
jasper
he
met
the
glance
and
understood
what
it
meant
he
knew
that
it
boded
him
no
good
the
company
assembled
gradually
dispersed
and
jasper
was
left
alone
with
his
you
see
that
i
am
left
your
guardian
she
said
yes
answered
jasper
briefly
perhaps
you
would
have
chosen
a
different
one
if
the
choice
had
been
left
to
you
she
continued
with
a
sneer
i
should
said
jasper
promptly
well
that
is
plain
language
i
suppose
you
expected
a
plain
answer
said
the
boy
firmly
i
did
not
expect
a
polite
one
you
appear
to
forget
that
i
am
a
lady
you
are
mistaken
madam
i
am
ready
to
treat
you
as
well
as
you
treat
me
i
wo
pretend
that
i
like
your
guardianship
as
i
fear
that
we
shall
not
agree
if
we
do
you
will
have
to
yield
said
his
i
would
rather
not
dispute
till
it
is
absolutely
necessary
said
jasper
may
i
ask
whether
you
desire
me
to
return
to
school
i
have
not
made
up
my
mind
i
may
be
able
to
tell
you
until
you
make
up
your
mind
you
expect
me
to
remain
at
home
i
suppose
yes
jasper
bowed
and
turned
away
he
went
down
stairs
into
the
hall
just
as
the
front
door
was
opened
and
the
familiar
voice
of
nicholas
thorne
was
heard
jasper
stared
in
some
surprise
at
the
intruder
not
knowing
that
he
was
expected
halloo
jasper
said
thorne
boisterously
how
are
you
i
am
well
said
jasper
distantly
where
mother
your
mother
your
aunt
you
mean
no
i
do
that
all
gammon
she
my
mother
she
is
exclaimed
jasper
what
made
you
deny
it
then
policy
said
thorne
laughing
your
father
might
not
have
liked
it
now
it
all
right
did
your
mother
send
for
you
asked
jasper
yes
of
course
she
did
this
is
to
be
my
home
now
jasper
made
no
comment
what
could
he
say
if
thorne
were
his
son
it
was
only
natural
that
he
should
live
in
the
house
of
which
she
was
mistress
but
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
he
were
being
pushed
out
of
his
own
house
and
these
strangers
were
coming
in
to
occupy
it
he
felt
that
it
would
no
longer
seem
like
home
to
him
well
where
my
mother
asked
thorne
she
up
stairs
shall
i
show
you
the
way
if
you
a
mind
to
i
guess
i
know
my
own
way
round
here
pretty
soon
what
a
detestable
fellow
thought
jasper
i
am
afraid
we
shall
quarrel
soon
he
led
the
way
up
stairs
and
ushered
nicholas
into
his
presence
this
uncouth
boy
was
the
one
object
this
selfish
woman
loved
she
uttered
an
exclamation
of
delight
welcome
home
my
dear
nicholas
she
exclaimed
advancing
hastily
and
throwing
her
arms
round
his
neck
he
received
the
embrace
apathetically
but
made
no
opposition
as
at
another
time
he
might
have
done
he
felt
on
good
terms
with
his
mother
and
the
whole
world
in
the
face
of
the
brilliant
improvement
of
his
prospects
are
you
well
my
dear
boy
asked
kent
oh
i
well
enough
mother
this
is
a
splendid
old
place
is
it
kent
laughed
at
jasper
yes
it
is
a
fine
jasper
left
the
two
and
went
down
stairs
say
mother
how
about
the
will
asked
thorne
is
it
all
right
a
third
of
the
estate
is
left
to
me
only
a
third
does
jasper
get
the
rest
yes
that
a
shame
you
ought
to
have
had
half
i
shall
have
control
of
the
whole
till
jasper
is
of
age
i
am
left
his
guardian
that
good
anyhow
you
must
make
him
toe
the
mark
mother
i
mean
to
he
always
had
his
own
way
and
he
may
give
you
trouble
he
feels
high
and
mighty
i
can
tell
you
i
shall
know
how
to
deal
with
him
said
kent
closing
her
thin
lips
resolutely
he
will
find
me
as
firm
as
himself
i
guess
that
so
mother
you
prove
a
tough
customer
kent
smiled
as
if
she
enjoyed
the
compliment
i
stand
by
you
mother
if
you
have
any
trouble
just
call
me
in
i
do
expect
to
need
any
help
nicholas
but
i
am
glad
to
find
i
have
a
brave
son
who
will
stand
by
his
mother
certainly
no
one
believed
in
nicholas
so
thoroughly
as
his
mother
to
the
world
generally
he
was
a
cowardly
bully
rough
brutal
and
selfish
in
his
mother
eyes
he
was
manly
and
a
paragon
of
youthful
virtue
i
have
already
said
that
thorne
affection
for
his
mother
was
far
less
disinterested
as
is
very
apt
to
be
the
case
with
boys
his
intention
to
benefit
by
the
change
of
circumstances
was
shown
at
once
what
allowance
are
you
going
to
give
me
mother
he
asked
i
have
not
thought
yet
nicholas
then
i
want
you
to
think
mother
how
much
do
you
want
i
want
as
much
as
jasper
gets
you
shall
receive
as
much
said
his
mother
promptly
do
you
know
how
much
he
has
received
yes
he
has
had
five
dollars
a
week
that
too
much
it
is
too
much
for
me
i
shall
reduce
his
allowance
to
three
dollars
a
week
you
do
expect
me
to
get
along
on
three
dollars
grumbled
thorne
i
will
give
you
five
and
jasper
only
three
yes
wo
he
be
mad
exclaimed
nicholas
with
malicious
satisfaction
what
you
say
to
him
about
it
i
shall
merely
announce
my
decision
said
kent
coolly
i
am
not
bound
to
assign
any
reasons
wo
there
be
a
precious
row
said
thorne
i
presume
he
will
complain
but
he
has
not
conducted
himself
toward
me
in
a
manner
to
secure
any
favors
i
say
mother
can
you
give
me
my
first
week
allowance
in
advance
i
awful
hard
up
here
my
son
said
kent
drawing
out
her
and
placing
a
bill
in
her
son
hand
good
for
you
mother
when
are
you
going
to
have
supper
in
an
hour
how
much
property
did
the
old
man
leave
the
estate
is
probably
fully
up
to
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
this
place
is
worth
fifteen
thousand
the
rest
is
in
good
stocks
and
bonds
and
a
third
belongs
to
you
i
say
mother
you
feathered
your
nest
well
i
guess
i
go
out
and
take
a
look
round
in
the
rear
of
the
house
in
front
of
the
stable
nicholas
caught
sight
of
jasper
he
smiled
maliciously
i
go
and
tell
him
about
the
reduction
in
his
allowance
he
said
to
himself
chapter
xi
the
outbreak
of
hostilities
jasper
was
quietly
thinking
over
his
change
of
circumstances
when
he
was
roused
by
a
rather
violent
slap
on
the
shoulder
turning
hastily
he
saw
that
it
was
nicholas
i
say
this
is
a
jolly
place
jasper
said
thorne
yes
said
jasper
it
has
been
my
home
as
far
back
as
i
can
remember
that
where
you
have
the
advantage
of
me
but
after
all
it
make
much
difference
as
long
as
it
going
to
be
my
home
now
jasper
did
reply
i
say
kent
it
seems
odd
that
me
and
you
are
brothers
said
thorne
not
very
grammatically
we
are
not
said
jasper
quickly
it
all
the
same
we
got
the
same
mother
you
are
mistaken
said
jasper
coldly
you
know
what
i
mean
she
my
mother
and
your
that
very
different
besides
the
relationship
is
so
very
recent
that
i
find
it
hard
to
think
of
your
mother
as
any
relation
at
all
she
is
though
i
suppose
me
and
you
will
be
a
good
deal
together
now
i
do
know
what
my
future
plans
will
be
said
jasper
not
very
much
elated
by
this
prospect
no
i
suppose
not
mother
arrange
about
them
how
much
allowance
did
your
father
use
to
give
you
jasper
thought
at
first
of
refusing
to
reply
but
it
occurred
to
him
that
under
the
new
and
strange
circumstances
it
was
not
an
improper
question
for
nicholas
to
ask
he
therefore
decided
to
reply
five
dollars
a
week
he
answered
when
was
it
paid
on
saturday
see
here
said
thorne
drawing
from
his
vest
pocket
the
bill
his
mother
had
given
him
what
of
it
said
jasper
it
my
allowance
for
this
week
said
thorne
triumphantly
i
congratulate
you
said
jasper
coldly
that
kind
in
you
returned
thorne
with
a
sneer
especially
as
you
are
cut
down
what
do
you
mean
asked
jasper
hastily
mother
says
five
dollars
a
week
is
too
much
for
you
she
going
to
cut
you
down
to
three
the
indignant
color
came
to
jasper
cheek
was
this
interloper
this
stranger
to
be
preferred
to
him
in
his
own
father
house
he
was
not
excessively
fond
of
money
and
had
there
been
need
would
not
have
objected
to
a
reduction
of
his
allowance
but
to
be
deprived
of
his
rights
in
favor
of
a
fellow
like
thorne
was
intolerable
if
nicholas
wished
to
annoy
and
anger
him
he
had
succeeded
who
told
you
this
demanded
jasper
sharply
my
mother
answered
nicholas
with
a
gratified
smile
when
about
fifteen
minutes
ago
replied
thorne
with
provoking
coolness
i
do
think
she
would
do
anything
so
outrageous
do
you
you
find
mother
got
plenty
of
grit
so
have
i
said
jasper
his
face
hardening
if
your
mother
undertakes
to
wrong
me
she
will
repent
it
you
had
better
not
say
that
to
her
said
thorne
insolently
i
shall
when
the
proper
time
comes
my
allowance
is
not
due
yet
i
do
care
for
the
money
but
my
father
knew
what
it
was
proper
for
me
to
have
there
going
to
be
a
row
thought
nicholas
with
satisfaction
bet
on
mother
she
put
down
this
jasper
turned
away
and
walked
out
of
the
yard
where
are
you
going
asked
thorne
to
walk
i
guess
i
go
along
too
i
would
rather
go
alone
you
not
very
polite
excuse
me
said
jasper
with
the
instinct
of
a
gentleman
you
would
find
me
very
poor
company
another
time
we
will
walk
together
oh
just
as
you
like
i
do
want
to
intrude
said
thorne
sulkily
they
did
not
meet
again
till
supper
kent
presided
on
one
side
sat
nicholas
on
the
other
jasper
our
hero
looked
sad
the
kind
worn
face
he
was
accustomed
to
see
at
the
head
of
the
table
was
gone
forever
he
felt
that
he
was
indeed
desolate
his
appetite
was
very
small
while
on
the
other
hand
nicholas
seemed
to
be
famished
his
mother
kept
plying
him
with
dainties
and
tidbits
and
he
appeared
to
like
the
treatment
amazingly
why
do
you
eat
jasper
asked
thorne
with
his
mouth
full
i
am
not
hungry
i
should
think
your
walk
might
have
given
you
an
appetite
it
does
appear
to
you
look
awful
glum
is
it
what
i
said
this
afternoon
about
what
your
allowance
being
cut
down
i
was
thinking
about
that
particularly
besides
you
are
not
the
one
from
whom
i
expect
to
receive
such
communications
it
all
true
though
as
you
will
find
ai
it
mother
persisted
nicholas
who
was
anxious
to
have
the
row
come
off
as
soon
as
possible
jasper
turned
his
glance
upon
kent
you
need
have
introduced
the
subject
nicholas
she
said
with
slight
reproof
why
not
mother
it
is
a
proper
subject
to
introduce
at
the
you
see
jasper
did
half
believe
what
i
told
him
he
may
rely
upon
your
statement
said
kent
am
i
to
understand
that
my
allowance
is
reduced
to
three
dollars
a
week
asked
jasper
who
felt
that
he
had
been
dragged
into
the
discussion
yes
i
consider
that
three
dollars
a
week
is
a
liberal
allowance
for
a
boy
of
your
age
my
father
gave
me
five
your
father
acted
according
to
his
judgment
said
kent
coldly
on
some
points
i
differ
from
him
in
judgment
i
think
that
he
indulged
you
too
much
probably
because
you
were
his
only
child
he
was
always
kind
to
me
said
jasper
it
was
his
nature
to
be
kind
you
will
find
me
kind
too
if
you
deserve
it
said
his
but
her
tone
belied
her
words
nicholas
tells
me
that
his
allowance
is
to
be
five
dollars
said
jasper
i
conceive
that
the
amount
of
his
allowance
has
nothing
to
do
with
yours
said
kent
is
it
true
persisted
jasper
it
is
said
kent
with
a
defiant
look
which
jasper
interpreted
to
mean
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
why
is
he
to
receive
five
dollars
if
i
am
only
to
get
three
because
i
choose
you
have
answered
rightly
said
jasper
scornfully
even
you
are
unable
to
defend
it
on
the
score
of
fairness
or
justice
kent
thin
lips
compressed
audacious
boy
she
exclaimed
do
you
dare
to
speak
to
me
in
this
style
i
am
not
aware
of
any
impropriety
madam
i
am
protesting
against
your
unjust
partiality
for
nicholas
he
is
my
son
i
am
aware
of
that
but
the
money
out
of
which
the
allowance
is
paid
came
to
you
from
my
father
do
you
dare
to
continue
your
impertinent
remarks
exclaimed
his
pale
with
rage
madam
i
am
only
stating
the
truth
said
jasper
sturdily
you
can
not
expect
me
to
submit
tamely
to
such
an
injustice
had
you
reduced
my
allowance
and
given
nicholas
no
more
i
would
have
let
it
pass
i
wo
submit
to
this
impertinence
exclaimed
kent
furiously
nicholas
will
you
sit
there
and
see
your
mother
insulted
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
mother
asked
thorne
not
exactly
liking
the
turn
matters
had
taken
put
that
unmannerly
boy
out
of
the
room
oh
there
ai
any
need
of
that
said
thorne
who
knew
by
experience
jasper
strength
do
as
i
say
or
i
will
give
you
no
allowance
at
all
said
kent
stamping
her
foot
angrily
nicholas
unwillingly
arose
from
his
seat
and
approached
jasper
you
better
not
try
it
thorne
said
jasper
coolly
do
you
hear
that
sir
he
has
insulted
you
too
said
kent
in
a
furious
passion
it
was
these
words
perhaps
that
spurred
nicholas
to
his
task
jasper
had
now
risen
and
thorne
threw
himself
upon
him
but
jasper
was
prepared
in
less
time
than
i
have
required
to
tell
it
thorne
found
himself
prostrate
on
the
floor
madam
said
jasper
turning
to
his
i
am
ready
to
leave
your
presence
now
but
of
my
own
accord
he
left
the
room
kent
was
too
astonished
to
speak
she
had
felt
no
doubt
that
nicholas
was
more
than
a
match
for
jasper
as
he
certainly
was
bigger
and
weighed
twenty
pounds
more
my
poor
boy
she
said
pitifully
bending
over
her
son
are
you
much
hurt
yes
said
nicholas
and
it
all
on
account
of
you
i
thought
you
were
stronger
than
he
so
i
am
but
he
knows
how
to
wrestle
besides
he
so
quick
i
thought
you
could
have
put
him
out
easily
well
do
set
me
to
doing
it
again
said
thorne
sulkily
i
want
to
fight
you
made
me
do
mind
it
my
dear
boy
it
was
because
i
was
angry
with
him
oh
how
my
head
aches
i
put
on
some
cologne
i
give
you
an
extra
five
dollars
too
for
standing
by
your
mother
all
right
mother
said
thorne
in
a
more
cheerful
tone
that
the
way
to
talk
give
it
to
me
now
jasper
did
not
see
either
of
them
again
that
evening
he
called
on
a
friend
and
entering
the
house
at
ten
went
directly
to
his
own
room
chapter
xii
a
scheme
of
vengeance
kent
had
never
cared
for
jasper
since
the
marriage
she
had
disliked
him
now
that
he
had
struck
down
nicholas
in
her
presence
she
positively
hated
him
she
did
not
stop
to
consider
that
he
was
provoked
to
it
and
only
acted
in
she
thirsted
for
revenge
more
indeed
than
nicholas
who
bully
as
he
was
having
been
fairly
worsted
was
disposed
to
accept
his
defeat
philosophically
if
he
could
annoy
or
thwart
jasper
he
would
have
been
glad
to
do
it
but
he
did
not
desire
to
injure
him
physically
not
so
kent
her
darling
had
been
assaulted
and
defeated
in
her
presence
she
did
not
again
wish
to
put
him
against
jasper
lest
he
should
be
again
defeated
but
she
wished
jasper
her
detested
to
drink
the
same
cup
of
humiliation
which
had
been
forced
upon
nicholas
so
she
sat
pondering
how
to
accomplish
the
object
she
had
in
view
she
could
not
herself
beat
jasper
though
had
he
been
younger
and
smaller
she
would
certainly
have
attempted
it
she
must
do
it
by
deputy
under
the
circumstances
she
thought
of
tom
forbes
a
strong
and
stalwart
hired
man
who
had
been
for
some
months
working
on
the
place
probably
he
would
not
like
the
task
but
she
would
threaten
to
discharge
him
if
he
refused
to
obey
her
commands
and
this
she
thought
would
bring
him
around
i
wonder
where
jasper
is
said
nicholas
about
eight
as
he
sat
opposite
the
little
table
where
his
mother
was
sewing
gone
out
i
suppose
said
kent
he
found
the
house
too
hot
to
hold
him
suggested
thorne
he
certainly
will
if
he
conducts
himself
in
the
future
as
he
has
already
done
he
makes
a
mistake
if
he
thinks
i
will
tolerate
such
conduct
it
because
you
a
woman
said
her
son
boys
of
his
age
do
make
much
account
of
women
do
you
speak
for
yourself
as
well
as
for
him
asked
kent
sharply
of
course
not
said
nicholas
whose
interest
it
was
to
keep
on
good
terms
with
his
mother
of
course
not
besides
you
are
my
mother
you
are
much
more
of
a
gentleman
than
jasper
is
said
his
mother
appeased
i
hope
so
said
nicholas
as
for
him
i
consider
him
a
young
ruffian
so
he
is
said
thorne
who
was
ready
to
assent
to
anything
that
his
mother
might
say
and
yet
his
father
thought
him
a
paragon
continued
kent
her
lip
curling
it
is
strange
how
parents
can
be
deceived
unconsciously
she
illustrated
the
truth
of
this
remark
in
her
own
person
she
considered
nicholas
handsome
spirited
and
amiable
indeed
as
an
unusually
fascinating
and
attractive
boy
to
others
he
was
big
overgrown
malicious
and
stupid
but
then
mothers
are
apt
to
look
through
different
spectacles
from
the
rest
of
the
world
i
guess
jasper
want
to
change
his
guardian
said
thorne
laughing
you
and
he
wo
hitch
horses
very
well
do
use
such
a
common
expression
nicholas
i
want
you
to
grow
up
a
gentleman
oh
well
i
mean
to
but
i
say
if
his
father
liked
him
so
much
what
made
him
appoint
you
to
take
care
of
him
he
did
know
how
i
felt
toward
jasper
i
humored
his
fancies
and
treated
him
better
than
i
felt
toward
him
then
you
wanted
to
be
his
guardian
yes
i
wanted
to
pay
off
old
scores
said
kent
again
compressing
her
lips
with
unpleasant
firmness
what
made
you
dislike
him
asked
her
son
with
curiosity
he
was
opposed
to
my
marriage
he
would
have
stopped
it
if
he
could
but
there
i
got
the
better
of
him
when
he
found
that
he
was
too
late
he
treated
me
with
coldness
he
never
liked
me
by
jove
i
do
think
he
had
much
reason
said
nicholas
laughing
boisterously
he
regret
not
having
treated
me
with
more
attention
i
can
thwart
all
his
plans
and
make
his
life
very
uncomfortable
i
trust
you
to
do
that
mother
you
got
spunk
enough
do
say
nicholas
what
shall
i
say
then
resolution
firmness
it
all
the
same
there
is
a
choice
in
words
remember
my
dear
boy
i
want
you
to
be
a
refined
and
cultivated
gentleman
well
i
can
be
now
you
rich
but
i
say
mother
what
are
you
going
to
do
you
ai
going
to
stick
down
in
this
dull
place
all
your
life
are
you
no
nicholas
in
the
summer
we
go
travelling
good
exclaimed
nicholas
with
satisfaction
where
will
we
go
how
would
you
like
to
go
to
niagara
falls
bully
or
to
saratoga
i
do
know
much
about
that
it
is
a
fashionable
place
can
a
fellow
have
fun
there
of
course
he
can
then
i
like
to
go
but
i
say
are
you
going
to
take
jasper
too
no
said
kent
decidedly
i
certainly
shall
not
give
him
so
much
pleasure
i
do
know
i
might
like
it
better
if
i
had
a
fellow
of
my
own
age
to
go
around
with
you
will
find
plenty
of
companions
more
agreeable
than
jasper
all
right
mother
i
suppose
you
know
best
you
can
trust
me
to
provide
for
your
happiness
nicholas
it
is
all
i
live
for
the
next
morning
kent
arose
early
and
summoned
the
hired
man
tom
forbes
tom
said
she
have
you
a
good
whip
yes
and
a
strong
arm
middlin
answered
the
wondering
hired
man
i
want
you
to
be
in
the
kitchen
provided
with
your
whip
when
breakfast
is
over
what
for
asked
tom
in
surprise
never
mind
now
i
shall
inform
you
at
the
time
all
right
twenty
minutes
later
jasper
unaware
of
his
benevolent
intentions
took
his
seat
at
the
chapter
xiii
kent
is
foiled
breakfast
was
a
quiet
meal
kent
preserved
a
frigid
silence
toward
jasper
interrupted
only
by
necessary
questions
nicholas
who
understood
that
there
was
a
row
in
prospect
occasionally
smiled
as
he
looked
across
the
table
at
jasper
but
he
too
was
silent
when
breakfast
was
over
and
the
three
arose
from
the
table
kent
said
in
a
cold
voice
jasper
kent
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
very
well
said
jasper
taking
a
seat
and
looking
expectant
yesterday
you
conducted
yourself
in
a
most
improper
manner
please
explain
said
jasper
quietly
you
ought
not
to
require
any
explanation
you
made
an
assault
upon
nicholas
i
beg
pardon
kent
but
he
made
an
assault
upon
me
you
knocked
him
down
not
until
he
attacked
me
he
did
so
by
my
direction
did
you
expect
me
to
make
no
resistance
asked
jasper
you
had
insulted
me
and
it
was
his
duty
as
my
son
to
resent
it
i
do
think
you
have
any
right
to
say
that
i
insulted
you
and
you
would
not
have
any
reason
to
complain
of
me
if
you
would
treat
me
with
ordinary
justice
and
politeness
you
are
insulting
me
now
said
kent
angrily
i
am
telling
the
truth
i
am
sorry
that
it
is
the
truth
i
would
prefer
to
live
on
good
terms
with
you
and
have
your
own
way
said
his
sarcastically
i
understand
you
but
i
will
have
you
know
that
i
am
mistress
in
this
house
are
you
ready
to
apologize
for
having
attacked
nicholas
i
did
not
wish
to
do
it
especially
as
he
did
attack
me
of
his
own
accord
but
if
he
should
do
so
again
i
should
act
in
the
same
manner
insolent
exclaimed
his
reddening
you
have
peculiar
ideas
of
insolence
said
jasper
quietly
i
believe
in
defending
myself
but
i
should
like
to
harm
nicholas
you
have
undertaken
to
rebel
against
my
authority
said
kent
but
you
do
understand
me
i
am
not
to
be
bullied
or
overcome
by
a
boy
you
are
in
no
danger
of
either
from
me
madam
i
shall
take
care
not
to
give
you
the
power
nicholas
call
tom
jasper
looked
at
his
in
amazement
what
had
tom
forbes
to
do
with
their
colloquy
nicholas
opened
the
door
of
the
adjoining
room
the
kitchen
and
summoned
the
hired
man
ignorant
of
why
he
was
wanted
for
kent
had
not
informed
him
he
came
into
the
room
and
looked
about
with
a
perplexed
expression
he
was
a
tall
fellow
of
about
or
six
where
is
your
whip
tom
demanded
kent
my
whip
repeated
tom
yes
did
i
tell
you
i
wanted
you
to
have
it
yes
it
in
the
kitchen
bring
it
tom
went
into
the
kitchen
and
returned
bringing
the
whip
what
am
i
to
do
with
it
he
asked
i
will
tell
you
in
a
moment
jasper
kent
said
his
turning
to
him
you
have
rebelled
against
my
just
authority
you
have
insulted
me
in
my
own
house
you
have
made
a
brutal
attack
upon
my
son
in
my
presence
and
now
i
am
going
to
have
you
punished
tom
i
order
you
to
give
jasper
half
a
dozen
lashes
with
your
whip
it
is
hard
to
tell
which
looked
the
more
surprised
at
this
brutal
command
jasper
or
the
hired
man
they
looked
at
each
other
in
amazement
but
tom
did
not
stir
did
you
hear
me
asked
kent
sharply
impatient
of
the
delay
yes
i
heard
you
answered
tom
slowly
why
do
you
obey
then
she
continued
in
the
same
tone
because
said
tom
with
manly
independence
i
did
hire
out
to
do
anything
of
the
kind
do
you
refuse
yes
i
do
you
may
do
your
own
dirty
work
it
seems
you
are
not
only
disobedient
but
insolent
said
kent
angrily
you
must
be
crazy
said
the
hired
man
bluntly
no
more
of
this
i
discharge
you
from
my
employment
what
for
not
flogging
master
jasper
for
not
obeying
me
i
follow
your
directions
so
far
as
they
are
in
the
line
of
duty
but
i
wo
do
that
i
discharge
you
as
to
that
if
i
go
i
let
everybody
in
the
village
know
why
you
sent
me
away
for
this
kent
was
not
altogether
prepared
she
knew
that
it
was
not
prudent
to
defy
public
opinion
perhaps
she
had
already
gone
too
far
she
put
a
great
constraint
upon
herself
and
said
go
back
to
your
work
i
will
speak
of
this
matter
hereafter
tom
withdrew
at
once
glad
of
the
opportunity
thus
far
kent
had
been
foiled
and
she
knew
it
she
could
scarcely
conceal
her
mortification
jasper
who
had
been
passive
thus
far
now
spoke
he
felt
outraged
and
disgusted
by
his
brutal
purpose
though
it
had
failed
kent
he
said
with
quiet
resolution
after
the
scene
of
this
morning
i
can
not
remain
in
the
same
house
with
you
my
father
has
not
been
dead
a
week
yet
you
have
treated
me
in
a
manner
which
though
i
never
liked
you
i
could
not
have
thought
possible
you
are
left
my
guardian
i
do
not
wish
to
remain
another
day
in
this
house
have
i
your
permission
to
return
to
school
no
said
his
why
not
because
you
wish
it
i
do
not
mean
to
let
you
have
your
own
way
i
am
willing
to
go
to
another
school
if
you
insist
upon
it
you
will
go
to
no
school
you
will
stay
here
in
this
house
yes
with
the
opinion
which
you
have
of
me
kent
i
should
hardly
think
this
would
be
very
agreeable
to
you
it
will
not
i
hate
the
sight
of
you
said
his
with
energy
i
am
sorry
for
that
but
i
am
not
surprised
from
the
way
you
have
treated
me
i
should
think
so
wo
it
be
better
for
as
both
to
be
separated
it
will
gratify
your
wishes
and
therefore
i
order
you
to
remain
here
that
we
may
have
more
such
scenes
as
yesterday
and
no
i
am
determined
to
break
your
rebellious
will
and
teach
you
to
obey
me
implicitly
i
have
only
to
ask
if
you
have
fully
made
up
your
mind
said
jasper
quietly
but
with
suppressed
excitement
i
mean
precisely
what
i
say
then
madam
i
shall
have
to
leave
this
house
and
go
out
into
the
world
i
shall
find
more
kindness
among
strangers
than
here
i
have
heard
boys
talk
like
this
before
said
kent
with
contemptuous
incredulity
boys
sometimes
mean
what
they
say
retorted
jasper
he
took
his
hat
and
left
the
room
without
another
word
i
say
mother
said
nicholas
suppose
he
do
come
back
there
no
fear
of
that
said
kent
coldly
but
i
say
mother
he
pretty
plucky
jasper
is
he
wo
run
away
from
me
as
long
as
i
have
charge
of
his
property
you
may
be
sure
of
that
he
be
coming
back
and
apologizing
pretty
soon
suppose
he
does
then
it
be
his
own
fault
you
may
as
well
let
him
go
back
to
school
mother
he
be
out
of
our
way
and
we
can
enjoy
ourselves
i
am
not
going
to
gratify
him
so
far
he
has
defied
me
and
insulted
me
and
he
must
take
the
consequences
said
kent
with
a
compression
of
her
thin
lips
on
the
whole
jasper
prospects
could
not
be
said
to
be
very
flattering
chapter
xiv
mediation
when
jasper
left
the
house
he
bent
his
steps
to
the
dwelling
of
a
friend
of
his
father
otis
miller
a
man
of
considerable
property
and
good
position
he
found
miller
at
home
i
am
glad
to
see
you
jasper
said
he
cordially
thank
you
sir
you
have
met
with
a
great
loss
said
miller
attributing
serious
expression
to
his
father
death
yes
sir
i
am
only
just
beginning
to
understand
how
much
a
father
place
can
not
be
supplied
no
sir
but
this
is
not
the
extent
of
my
trouble
can
i
do
anything
to
help
you
yes
sir
i
am
very
much
in
need
of
advice
i
shall
be
glad
to
give
you
the
best
i
can
jasper
i
was
your
friend
and
i
shall
be
glad
to
be
yours
also
thank
you
sir
my
troubles
are
connected
with
my
who
treats
me
like
an
enemy
can
this
be
so
asked
miller
in
surprise
i
will
tell
you
all
and
then
ask
your
advice
do
so
jasper
told
the
story
briefly
and
without
excitement
it
was
only
in
his
presence
that
he
felt
disturbed
i
have
met
your
but
i
know
very
little
of
her
said
miller
she
never
impressed
me
very
favorably
but
i
never
dreamed
that
she
would
act
in
such
an
unreasonable
manner
perhaps
even
now
matters
are
not
as
bad
as
you
think
sometimes
people
say
things
in
anger
which
they
repent
of
in
their
cooler
moments
i
do
think
it
is
the
case
with
mrs
kent
it
is
unfortunate
since
she
is
your
guardian
i
wish
you
were
my
guardian
mr
miller
for
your
sake
jasper
i
wish
i
were
i
do
think
we
should
quarrel
i
know
we
should
not
you
wish
to
know
what
to
do
yes
you
are
quite
sure
you
can
not
stay
at
home
i
should
be
subject
to
constant
persecution
from
mrs
kent
you
think
she
would
not
allow
you
to
go
back
to
school
she
has
refused
to
do
so
there
is
one
thing
she
can
not
do
and
that
is
keep
your
portion
of
the
estate
from
you
when
you
become
of
age
no
i
suppose
not
you
will
then
be
rich
but
the
money
wo
do
me
any
good
now
will
it
in
this
way
it
will
suppose
i
agree
to
pay
your
expenses
at
school
that
is
to
say
advancing
the
money
to
be
repaid
when
you
obtain
yours
that
would
be
very
kind
miller
but
i
should
like
to
subject
you
to
that
risk
you
mean
that
a
minor
promise
would
be
invalid
well
jasper
i
have
too
much
confidence
in
you
to
have
any
doubt
of
your
integrity
thank
you
miller
but
suppose
i
should
die
before
attaining
my
majority
then
i
should
probably
lose
the
money
that
is
what
i
thought
of
i
should
not
like
to
have
you
run
the
risk
but
i
am
willing
to
do
so
however
it
may
be
as
well
to
ascertain
definitely
your
intentions
first
i
will
call
upon
her
in
your
interest
and
find
out
thank
you
sir
i
should
like
to
have
you
do
so
as
i
do
want
to
act
too
hastily
i
will
go
at
once
will
you
remain
here
till
i
return
yes
sir
when
kent
was
told
that
miller
had
called
to
see
her
she
went
down
to
meet
him
not
surmising
his
errand
kent
said
he
after
the
ordinary
greetings
were
over
i
have
called
with
reference
to
your
relations
to
your
late
husband
son
jasper
did
he
ask
you
to
come
demanded
kent
frowning
no
but
he
came
to
ask
my
advice
as
to
what
he
ought
to
do
i
am
sorry
to
hear
that
you
are
unfriendly
he
has
treated
me
with
intolerable
insolence
said
kent
hotly
that
surprises
me
it
is
wholly
contrary
to
his
reputation
with
those
who
have
known
him
from
his
infancy
said
miller
quietly
then
you
do
know
him
as
he
is
he
tells
me
you
have
accorded
your
own
son
superior
privileges
my
son
treats
me
with
respect
probably
you
treat
him
differently
from
jasper
i
have
reasons
to
you
will
admit
that
it
is
aggravating
to
see
a
stranger
an
intruder
i
may
say
preferred
to
him
in
his
own
home
who
calls
my
son
an
intruder
asked
kent
hastily
let
us
call
him
a
stranger
then
was
kent
aware
that
you
had
a
son
i
decline
to
answer
your
question
answered
kent
with
asperity
to
pass
on
then
have
you
refused
jasper
permission
to
return
to
the
school
at
which
his
father
placed
him
i
have
may
i
ask
why
i
do
know
that
i
am
responsible
to
you
kent
said
miller
gravely
i
was
the
friend
of
your
late
husband
i
am
the
friend
of
his
son
jasper
as
the
friend
of
both
i
ask
you
your
reason
i
will
answer
you
though
i
do
not
acknowledge
your
right
to
ask
i
refuse
to
let
jasper
go
back
to
school
because
i
wish
to
punish
him
for
his
insolence
and
disobedience
it
can
not
be
any
satisfaction
to
you
to
have
him
at
home
i
should
think
it
is
not
i
have
no
reason
to
like
his
society
then
it
appears
that
you
punish
yourself
in
keeping
him
here
yes
do
you
think
kent
that
you
have
any
right
to
deprive
him
of
the
opportunity
to
obtain
an
education
he
can
attend
school
in
this
village
said
kent
you
know
as
well
as
i
that
there
is
neither
a
classical
nor
a
high
school
here
he
would
be
compelled
to
give
up
the
course
of
study
upon
which
he
has
commenced
that
is
his
own
fault
returned
kent
doggedly
this
then
is
your
unalterable
determination
for
the
present
yes
if
jasper
repents
his
and
makes
up
his
mind
to
yield
me
that
implicit
obedience
which
is
my
due
i
may
hereafter
consent
to
return
him
to
school
but
he
must
turn
over
a
new
leaf
madam
said
miller
disgusted
at
the
woman
manner
do
you
consider
that
you
are
carrying
out
his
father
wishes
in
reference
to
his
son
that
is
a
question
for
me
to
decide
said
kent
coldly
i
have
undertaken
the
responsibility
and
i
have
no
fears
about
carrying
out
his
wishes
i
must
trust
my
own
judgment
not
that
of
others
madam
said
miller
after
a
pause
there
is
one
other
question
which
i
should
like
to
put
to
you
very
well
sir
this
guardianship
imposed
upon
you
is
a
certain
amount
of
care
are
you
willing
to
relinquish
it
to
another
to
you
perhaps
suggested
kent
with
a
sneer
i
should
be
willing
to
undertake
it
for
jasper
sake
i
have
no
doubt
you
would
and
i
presume
jasper
would
be
very
glad
to
have
you
do
so
i
think
he
would
though
he
did
authorize
me
to
speak
to
you
about
it
said
miller
then
sir
i
refuse
in
the
most
emphatic
terms
i
shall
not
relinquish
the
power
which
his
father
will
gives
me
over
him
he
shall
yet
repent
his
insolence
i
regret
your
animosity
kent
said
miller
with
dignity
rising
as
he
spoke
i
was
inclined
to
think
that
jasper
had
exaggerated
his
account
of
the
difficulties
i
see
now
that
he
was
correct
i
have
only
in
wishing
you
to
predict
that
you
will
yet
regret
the
manner
in
which
you
have
treated
your
i
will
take
my
chance
of
that
said
kent
you
may
report
to
jasper
that
my
only
terms
are
unconditional
submission
i
will
do
so
madam
but
you
know
as
well
as
i
what
his
answer
will
be
his
nature
is
too
manly
to
submit
to
tyranny
even
from
his
you
are
not
sir
said
kent
angrily
i
am
truthful
madam
was
the
grave
reply
chapter
xv
without
exception
jasper
said
miller
on
his
return
i
consider
your
the
most
disagreeble
woman
i
ever
met
jasper
could
not
help
smiling
at
the
look
of
disgust
upon
the
features
of
his
father
friend
then
sir
i
infer
that
you
did
not
succeed
in
your
mission
he
said
succeed
no
she
will
offer
no
terms
except
unconditional
submission
on
your
part
that
i
wo
agree
to
said
jasper
promptly
i
do
blame
you
not
a
particle
said
miller
so
much
is
settled
then
said
jasper
now
the
question
comes
up
what
am
i
to
do
how
old
are
you
nearly
sixteen
then
five
years
must
elapse
before
you
come
into
possession
of
your
property
yes
sir
and
for
that
length
of
time
you
are
to
be
under
the
guardianship
of
mrs
kent
yes
sir
it
is
unfortunate
said
the
old
gentleman
shrugging
his
shoulders
i
took
the
liberty
to
suggest
to
your
that
if
the
cares
of
a
guardian
should
prove
burdensome
to
her
i
would
assume
them
what
did
she
say
she
replied
in
a
sarcastic
manner
and
avowed
her
determination
to
remain
your
guardian
what
would
you
advise
me
to
do
then
mr
miller
before
answering
jasper
i
will
tell
you
a
secret
jasper
looked
curious
your
father
left
in
my
hands
a
paper
to
be
opened
two
years
after
his
death
it
undoubtedly
relates
to
you
what
do
you
think
it
is
it
may
relate
to
the
guardianship
but
that
is
only
conjecture
does
my
know
of
this
neither
she
nor
anyone
else
save
you
and
myself
it
will
do
us
no
good
at
present
no
but
it
influences
my
advice
go
to
school
for
the
next
two
years
i
will
advance
the
money
to
pay
your
bills
if
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
paper
is
what
i
hope
it
is
you
will
then
be
able
to
pay
me
and
for
the
balance
of
your
minority
i
can
become
your
guardian
i
wish
you
might
miller
but
i
do
think
under
the
circumstances
i
want
to
go
back
to
school
what
do
you
wish
to
do
jasper
i
am
young
and
i
would
like
to
see
something
of
the
world
i
would
like
to
imagine
myself
a
poor
boy
as
i
really
am
just
now
and
see
if
i
can
not
make
my
own
way
i
hardly
know
what
to
say
to
that
jasper
i
am
afraid
you
do
not
appreciate
the
difficulties
in
your
way
to
battle
against
them
will
make
me
strong
suppose
you
get
in
a
tight
place
then
i
will
write
to
you
for
help
that
better
on
this
condition
i
will
make
no
further
opposition
to
your
wishes
but
have
you
any
money
ten
dollars
rather
a
small
sum
to
begin
the
world
with
yes
sir
if
you
are
willing
to
lend
me
fifty
more
i
think
i
can
get
along
till
i
can
earn
some
willingly
where
do
you
propose
to
go
to
the
west
my
father
has
a
cousin
a
lady
married
and
living

town
on
the
banks
of

should
like
to
go
out
there
and
see
if
i
ca
find
some
employment
in
that
neighborhood
i
suppose
i
must
not
object
but
your
plan
appears
to
me
rather
quixotic
you
might
not
have
thought
so
at
my
age
mr
miller
no
we
look
upon
such
things
differently

few
underclothes

jasper
did
as
proposed
he
would
gladly
have
dispensed
with
this
call
at
the
house
which
had
once
been
a
home
to
him
but
was
so
no
longer

glad
of
that

half
an
hour
later
as
jasper
was
going
up
the
street
with
his
in
one
hand
he
saw
the
open
carriage
approaching
in
which
kent
and
nicholas
were
seated
he
would
liked
to
have
escaped
observation
but
there
was
no
chance
why
there
jasper
said
nicholas
and
he
got
a
in
his
hand
stop
the
carriage
said
kent
peremptorily
nicholas
who
was
driving
obeyed
have
you
been
to
the
house
asked
the
yes
said
jasper
what
does
that
mean
it
means
that

am

away
where
as
your
guardian
i
demand
to
know
as
my
guardian

for
my
expenses

then
i

called
upon
to
tell

insubordination
said
kent
angrily

answered
jasper
with
emphasis
mrs

said
kent
angrily
how
i
hate
that
boy
she
ejaculated
it
strikes
me
mother

nicholas

his
property

chapter
xvi
an
unpleasant
adventure
a
week
later
jasper
was
one
of
the
passengers
on
a
train
bound
for
louis
and
already
within
sixty
miles
of
that
flourishing
city
he
had
stopped
over
at
niagara
and
cincinnati
a
day
or
so
at
each
place
he
gratified
his
desire
to
see
the
great
cataract
and
felt
repaid
for
doing
so
though
the
two
stops
trenched
formidably
upon
his
small
capital
indeed
at
the
moment
when
he
is
introduced
anew
to
the
reader
notice
he
had
but
ten
dollars
remaining
of
the
sum
with
which
he
started
he
was
however
provided
besides
with
a
through
ticket
to
louis
he
had
been
sitting
alone
when
a
stranger
entering
the
car
seated
himself
in
the
vacant
seat
looking
up
jasper
noticed
that
he
was
a
tall
man
shabbily
dressed
with
thin
sallow
face
and
a
swelling
in
the
left
cheek
probably
produced
by
a
quid
of
tobacco
colonel
said
the
stranger
sociably
sir
said
jasper
smiling
i
have
the
honor
of
being
a
colonel
have
you
well
that
ai
of
no
account
it
come
in
time
where
are
you
travelling
to
st
louis
ever
been
there
afore
no
this
will
be
my
first
visit
you
do
say
where
may
you
be
from
from
new
york
state
answered
jasper
amused
the
stranger
drew
from
his
pocket
a
package
of
chewing
tobacco
and
passed
it
politely
to
jasper
help
yourself
colonel
he
said
hospitably
no
thank
you
i
do
chew
shoo
you
do
say
so
high
time
you
began
then
i
do
think
i
shall
ever
form
the
habit
of
chewing
yes
you
will
colonel
everybody
does
travellin
on
business
well
not
exactly
said
jasper
hesitatingly
that
is
i
am
looking
for
a
chance
to
go
into
business
got
any
capital
interjected
the
stranger
carelessly
squirting
a
yellow
stream
upon
the
floor
of
the
car
oh
i
do
expect
to
go
into
business
for
myself
at
present
said
jasper
amused
at
the
thought
no
said
the
other
reflectively
if
you
had
five
thousand
dollars
i
might
take
you
into
partnership
what
is
your
business
asked
jasper
with
curiosity
cotton
said
the
stranger
i
a
cotton
broker
i
do
a
large
business
you
do
look
like
it
thought
jasper
looking
at
his
shabby
costume
you
do
want
a
clerk
do
you
asked
our
hero
well
no
colonel
there
ai
any
vacancy
now
in
my
establishment
may
be
soon
had
jasper
felt
favorably
impressed
with
his
companion
he
would
have
inquired
where
in
the
city
his
place
of
business
might
be
but
it
did
not
strike
him
that
he
should
care
to
be
in
his
employ
he
accordingly
pulled
out
a
copy
of
a
popular
magazine
which
he
had
bought
the
day
before
and
began
to
read
the
stranger
bought
a
paper
of
the
and
engaged
in
a
similar
way
fifteen
minutes
passed
in
this
way
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
stranger
rose
leisurely
and
with
a
brief
mornin
colonel
passed
out
of
the
car
whether
he
got
into
the
next
one
or
got
out
at
the
station
which
they
were
approaching
jasper
could
not
distinguish
nor
did
he
feel
specially
interested
in
the
matter
the
time
soon
came
when
he
felt
his
interest
increased
a
few
miles
further
on
the
conductor
entered
the
car
it
was
one
of
his
usual
rounds
to
look
at
tickets
when
he
came
up
to
jasper
he
said
be
lively
now
let
me
see
your
ticket
is
it
in
my
hat
asked
jasper
taking
it
off
no
did
you
put
it
there
i
thought
i
did
said
our
hero
surprised
it
was
there
when
you
last
passed
round
look
in
your
pockets
jasper
felt
in
all
of
them
but
the
missing
ticket
could
not
be
found
it
may
have
fallen
on
the
floor
he
said
and
rising
he
looked
under
the
seat
but
in
vain
did
you
have
any
ticket
asked
the
conductor
suspiciously
certainly
you
have
looked
at
it
yourself
several
times
you
are
mistaken
i
got
on
at
the
last
station
i
have
come
all
the
way
from
cincinnati
said
jasper
uncomfortably
i
could
have
come
so
far
without
a
ticket
what
shall
i
do
you
have
to
pay
from
the
last
station
to
st
louis
this
was
not
very
agreeable
in
the
state
of
jasper
finances
how
much
is
it
he
asked
two
dollars
jasper
felt
for
his
when
a
new
surprise
awaited
him
a
look
of
consternation
swept
over
his
countenance
his
was
gone
do
keep
me
waiting
said
the
conductor
impatiently
my
is
gone
exclaimed
our
hero
gazing
in
blank
dismay
at
the
expectant
official
what
i
ca
find
my
look
here
young
man
said
the
conductor
roughly
that
too
thin
it
true
said
jasper
it
wo
go
down
young
man
i
seen
such
customers
as
you
before
you
a
beat
a
what
a
beat
a
if
you
prefer
it
off
you
go
at
the
next
station
jasper
was
greatly
alarmed
at
the
unexpected
turn
affairs
had
taken
let
me
go
to
louis
and
i
get
money
to
pay
you
it
no
use
said
the
conductor
inexorably
my
orders
are
strict
if
you
ca
pay
you
ca
ride
but
my
pocket
was
picked
said
jasper
new
light
flashing
upon
him
there
was
a
stranger
who
sat
beside
me
a
while
ago
he
must
have
taken
my
ticket
and
money
too
of
course
there
was
said
the
conductor
with
sarcasm
that
the
way
it
usually
happens
i
used
to
such
games
young
man
it
wo
do
you
any
good
out
you
go
let
me
go
through
the
cars
and
see
if
i
ca
find
the
man
that
robbed
me
i
know
him
in
a
minute
well
said
the
conductor
relenting
slightly
be
quick
about
it
jasper
waited
for
no
more
he
rose
from
his
seat
and
in
hand
passed
into
the
next
car
it
proved
to
be
the
smoking
car
groups
of
men
were
playing
cards
and
as
jasper
judged
were
playing
for
money
among
them
to
his
great
joy
he
recognized
his
shabby
companion
the
cotton
broker
of
louis
the
latter
was
playing
with
three
other
men
and
loud
both
in
their
dress
and
speech
without
a
moment
hesitation
jasper
advanced
and
touched
his
late
companion
on
the
shoulder
the
latter
looked
up
and
without
a
sign
of
recognition
said
what
wanted
sir
for
the
first
time
it
struck
jasper
that
his
errand
was
rather
an
awkward
one
how
could
he
ask
this
man
if
he
had
taken
his
property
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
said
he
but
did
you
see
anything
of
my
ticket
and
money
what
do
you
mean
stranger
you
were
sitting
by
me
a
little
while
ago
in
the
rear
car
i
do
remember
it
and
i
thought
you
might
have
seen
my
and
ticket
well
i
did
said
the
other
fiercely
what
made
you
think
i
did
i
ca
find
them
i
do
know
anything
about
them
general
it
your
deal
he
turned
abruptly
away
from
jasper
and
the
boy
slowly
withdrew
to
a
little
distance
sorely
puzzled
on
the
one
hand
he
felt
convinced
that
this
man
had
abstracted
his
ticket
and
money
on
the
other
he
doubted
whether
it
would
be
safe
to
charge
him
with
it
while
he
was
hesitating
the
cars
began
to
go
more
slowly
the
conductor
entered
the
car
have
you
found
your
ticket
he
asked
no
then
leave
the
train
at
this
next
jasper
had
no
chance
to
remonstrate
obeying
necessity
he
stepped
upon
the
platform
and
the
train
swept
on
chapter
xvii
the
deserted
house
to
be
without
money
is
far
from
pleasant
under
any
circumstances
but
to
be
penniless
a
thousand
miles
from
home
in
the
midst
of
strangers
is
far
worse
jasper
found
himself
in
this
position
so
unexpectedly
that
as
he
stood
beside
the
little
depot
with
his
in
his
hand
he
felt
utterly
bewildered
he
looked
around
him
not
a
house
was
in
sight
why
the
railroad
company
should
have
established
a
depot
there
he
could
not
understand
probably
there
must
be
some
village
not
far
away
no
other
passenger
had
got
out
with
jasper
there
was
no
other
person
in
sight
but
the
a
tall
man
in
a
slouched
hat
who
eyed
our
hero
curiously
jasper
approached
him
what
place
is
this
he
asked
do
you
know
questioned
the
man
no
what
made
you
stop
here
then
jasper
hesitated
there
seemed
no
use
in
taking
this
man
into
his
confidence
i
am
going
to
take
a
look
at
the
village
i
suppose
there
is
a
village
well
drawled
the
man
there
some
houses
back
what
the
name
of
the
place
croyden
how
far
back
is
the
village
a
matter
of
two
miles
is
it
easy
to
find
the
way
there
the
road
the
pointed
out
a
road
leading
through
woods
thank
you
said
jasper
you
do
happen
to
have
any
with
you
asked
the
no
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
thought
maybe
you
might
i
most
out
jasper
took
the
road
indicated
by
his
informant
and
pressed
on
when
he
had
walked
half
a
mile
along
the
lonely
road
he
stopped
suddenly
and
asked
himself
what
are
my
plans
what
use
is
there
in
going
to
croyden
it
was
a
hard
question
to
answer
still
he
must
go
somewhere
he
could
not
go
to
louis
without
money
and
there
was
a
bare
possibility
that
he
might
find
something
to
do
in
croyden
if
he
could
earn
a
few
dollars
he
could
go
on
and
once
in
a
large
city
there
would
be
hope
of
permanent
employment
how
different
would
have
been
his
situation
if
he
had
not
lost
his
money
and
how
unfortunate
it
was
that
he
should
have
been
set
down
at
this
dismal
place
he
kept
on
meeting
no
one
finally
he
came
to
a
place
where
the
road
divided
into
two
forks
or
branches
one
leading
to
the
right
the
other
to
the
left
which
shall
i
take
he
asked
himself
there
seemed
no
choice
so
far
as
he
could
see
neither
was
very
promising
nor
was
there
any
to
inform
him
of
what
he
wished
to
know
i
wish
somebody
would
come
along
thought
jasper
but
nobody
did
forced
to
decide
he
decided
in
favor
of
the
road
and
walked
on
after
a
while
he
began
to
suspect
that
he
had
made
a
wrong
decision
the
road
became
little
more
than
a
lane
and
seemed
unfrequented
but
just
as
he
was
going
to
turn
back
he
espied
at
some
distance
from
the
road
a
rude
dwelling
which
from
its
appearance
seemed
never
to
have
been
painted
i
can
find
out
something
there
at
any
rate
thought
jasper
and
he
bent
his
steps
toward
it
brief
time
brought
him
in
front
of
the
house
it
was
certainly
a
place
it
must
be
dismal
to
live
here
thought
jasper
he
knocked
with
his
fist
at
the
door
on
account
of
the
smallness
of
the
house
the
knock
certainly
must
have
been
heard
but
there
was
no
response
the
people
must
be
deaf
thought
jasper
he
knocked
again
this
time
considerably
louder
and
waited
for
some
one
to
answer
his
summons
he
waited
in
vain
it
must
be
a
deserted
house
thought
our
hero
i
have
a
great
mind
to
explore
it
that
is
if
i
can
get
in
he
tried
the
door
and
a
little
to
his
surprise
it
yielded
to
his
touch
the
door
being
in
the
centre
of
the
house
there
was
a
room
on
each
side
the
door
to
the
left
opened
into
a
room
which
was
quite
bare
of
furniture
on
the
other
side
however
was
a
room
containing
a
table
and
three
chairs
on
the
table
was
a
dirty
and
a
box
of
tobacco
and
there
was
a
dead
odor
of
lingering
in
the
room
that
looks
as
if
there
were
somebody
living
here
thought
jasper
halloo
he
shouted
raising
his
voice
he
felt
that
it
would
be
better
to
make
his
presence
known
as
otherwise
he
might
be
suspected
of
entering
the
house
with
burglarious
designs
though
it
would
have
puzzled
a
burglar
to
find
anything
worth
purloining
there
ca
be
anybody
in
the
house
or
i
should
have
been
heard
thought
our
hero
however
i
call
again
this
time
there
was
a
faint
sound
that
came
to
his
ears
it
seemed
like
the
voice
of
a
child
where
did
that
come
from
jasper
considered
and
he
waited
to
hear
if
it
would
be
repeated
it
was
repeated
and
now
he
could
make
out
that
it
came
from
above
i
go
up
he
decided
he
climbed
the
rude
staircase
and
pushed
open
the
door
of
the
room
above
the
one
in
which
he
had
been
standing
a
moment
before
he
gazed
in
wonder
at
the
spectacle
before
him
a
boy
five
years
of
age
who
in
spite
of
his
frightened
expression
possessed
great
personal
beauty
was
lying
on
a
bed
in
one
corner
of
the
room
he
looked
at
jasper
in
uncertainty
at
first
then
with
confidence
and
said
did
you
come
for
me
do
you
live
here
asked
jasper
in
surprise
for
this
boy
was
not
at
all
like
the
children
usually
to
be
found
in
such
houses
as
this
his
complexion
was
of
dazzling
whiteness
his
hair
was
a
bright
chestnut
and
his
clothing
was
such
as
wealthy
parents
can
afford
to
give
to
their
children
do
you
live
here
repeated
jasper
no
said
the
child
how
came
you
here
then
big
man
big
ugly
man
brought
me
when
i
do
know
said
the
child
he
was
evidently
too
young
to
measure
the
lapse
of
time
was
it
yesterday
no
long
ago
i
suppose
it
seems
long
to
him
thought
jasper
is
there
nobody
else
in
the
house
asked
jasper
there
a
woman
said
the
little
boy
is
she
the
wife
of
the
man
who
took
you
away
but
this
question
the
little
boy
did
not
seem
to
comprehend
have
you
got
a
mother
asked
jasper
take
me
to
mamma
said
the
little
fellow
stretching
out
his
arms
and
beginning
to
cry
i
want
to
see
my
mamma
jasper
advanced
to
the
bed
he
began
to
understand
that
the
boy
had
been
kidnapped
and
he
felt
great
compassion
for
him
he
tried
to
raise
the
boy
from
the
bed
and
take
him
in
his
arms
when
he
made
an
unexpected
discovery
the
boy
ankles
were
firmly
tied
by
a
rope
which
connected
with
the
bedpost
so
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
leave
the
bed
who
did
this
asked
jasper
indignantly
who
tied
you
it
was
the
man
the
big
ugly
man
answered
the
child
i
will
soon
unfasten
you
said
jasper
and
he
set
to
work
untying
the
knot
will
you
take
me
home
asked
the
little
boy
yes
said
jasper
soothingly
i
take
you
home
but
just
as
he
had
completed
his
task
he
heard
steps
upon
the
stairs
what
if
it
were
the
man
of
whom
the
child
spoke
jasper
threw
one
arm
around
the
child
and
with
his
teeth
set
hard
fixed
his
eyes
expectantly
upon
the
door
chapter
xviii
the
kidnapped
child
the
woman
who
entered
was
of
middle
size
dressed
in
a
cheap
print
dirty
and
faded
which
corresponded
very
well
with
her
general
aspect
she
looked
weary
and
worn
and
moved
languidly
as
if
she
had
little
interest
in
life
she
looked
startled
at
the
sight
of
jasper
and
pressed
her
hand
to
her
heart
who
are
you
she
asked
a
stranger
answered
our
hero
how
came
you
here
i
suppose
i
ought
to
apologize
for
being
here
but
i
knocked
twice
and
got
no
answer
that
made
me
think
the
house
was
deserted
i
entered
and
hearing
a
low
cry
came
to
this
room
the
woman
sank
into
a
chair
near
the
door
is
this
your
child
asked
jasper
in
his
turn
the
woman
answered
hesitatingly
after
a
pause
no
i
knew
he
could
not
be
how
did
he
come
here
my
husband
brought
him
here
answered
the
woman
with
some
hesitation
is
he
any
relation
to
you
is
he
boarding
here
yes
the
woman
hesitation
increased
jasper
suspicion
he
said
i
found
the
boy
tied
to
the
bedpost
did
you
tie
him
yes
why
did
you
do
that
i
thought
he
might
slip
off
while
i
was
out
i
went
out
for
some
water
that
is
the
reason
i
did
not
answer
your
knock
madam
said
jasper
coming
to
the
point
you
may
answer
me
or
not
but
if
you
do
tell
the
truth
was
not
this
child
stolen
the
woman
looked
nervous
and
frightened
and
moved
restlessly
in
her
chair
do
blame
me
she
said
it
was
my
fault
whose
was
it
then
it
was
my
husband
then
the
child
was
stolen
yes
i
suppose
your
husband
kidnapped
the
child
in
order
to
get
money
from
the
parents
for
his
return
yes
the
woman
admitted
how
can
you
assist
him
in
such
wicked
practices
what
can
i
do
said
the
woman
helplessly
i
have
spoken
to
him
but
it
does
no
good
he
wo
heed
anything
that
i
say
jasper
began
to
pity
the
poor
woman
it
looked
as
if
she
were
an
unwilling
helper
in
her
husband
crimes
do
you
know
where
your
husband
got
this
boy
from
he
asked
no
he
did
tell
me
is
this
the
first
child
he
has
kidnapped
i
ought
not
to
speak
against
my
husband
said
the
woman
uneasily
appearing
to
think
that
she
had
already
told
too
much
yes
you
ought
otherwise
you
will
be
as
bad
as
he
he
will
beat
me
does
he
ever
do
that
asked
jasper
compassionately
he
is
very
rough
sometimes
said
the
wife
shrinking
i
am
sorry
for
you
said
jasper
gently
where
is
your
husband
now
he
went
out
this
morning
perhaps
he
is
hunting
he
never
tells
me
where
he
is
going
when
do
you
expect
him
back
i
ca
tell
he
may
be
here
in
five
minutes
he
may
not
be
here
before
night
in
that
case
thought
jasper
i
had
better
be
off
as
soon
as
possible
i
should
be
no
match
for
this
brute
in
human
form
judging
from
what
i
have
heard
of
him
he
would
kill
me
without
scruple
if
he
thought
i
were
interfering
with
his
plans
how
long
has
this
child
been
here
he
asked
three
or
four
days
i
am
going
to
take
him
away
proceeded
jasper
fixing
his
eyes
earnestly
upon
the
woman
to
see
how
she
took
the
proposal
no
no
she
exclaimed
quickly
my
husband
wo
allow
it
he
wo
know
it
it
wo
do
she
continued
rapidly
he
would
kill
you
if
he
overtook
you
this
was
a
serious
consideration
truly
jasper
had
no
weapons
and
a
boy
of
his
age
would
have
been
a
poor
match
for
a
strong
man
as
the
kidnapper
probably
was
after
all
i
had
better
not
interfere
he
thought
it
can
do
no
good
and
will
only
expose
me
to
great
danger
but
just
at
this
instant
the
little
boy
soft
hand
slid
into
his
and
he
could
not
resist
the
touching
appeal
for
his
protection
i
shall
take
the
risk
he
said
i
ca
leave
the
boy
here
i
will
try
to
find
his
parents
and
restore
him
to
them
he
had
scarcely
said
this
when
the
woman
who
had
casually
glanced
out
of
the
window
started
up
in
alarm
exclaiming
there
is
my
husband
coming
oh
what
shall
we
do
chapter
xix
a
brute
in
human
shape
jasper
could
not
help
feeling
that
he
was
in
rather
a
critical
position
a
man
whose
business
it
was
to
kidnap
young
children
in
order
to
extort
money
from
their
friends
was
not
likely
to
be
very
scrupulous
and
the
fear
of
having
his
secret
divulged
might
lead
him
to
extreme
measures
is
your
husband
likely
to
come
up
here
he
asked
i
do
know
he
may
answered
the
woman
anxiously
ca
you
hide
me
suggested
jasper
yes
yes
she
said
recovering
something
of
her
presence
of
mind
there
get
into
that
closet
i
come
and
let
you
out
when
he
is
gone
she
opened
the
door
of
a
closet
in
one
corner
of
the
room
it
was
quite
dark
inside
and
except
a
stool
it
was
entirely
empty
sit
down
there
said
the
woman
i
must
go
down
now
she
buttoned
the
door
and
our
hero
found
himself
a
close
prisoner
in
the
dark
it
certainly
gave
him
a
peculiar
sensation
only
a
week
before
he
had
been
at
his
eastern
home
now
he
was
more
than
a
thousand
miles
away
penniless
and
a
prisoner
but
though
he
was
peculiarly
situated
he
was
not
discouraged
in
fact
with
a
brave
boy
love
of
adventure
he
felt
a
certain
exhilaration
and
wondered
what
was
coming
next
his
courage
and
enterprise
rose
with
the
occasion
and
he
began
to
consider
what
course
he
should
take
after
he
got
out
while
he
is
sitting
in
the
closet
in
dark
captivity
we
will
go
below
and
make
acquaintance
with
the
man
whose
arrival
had
produced
so
great
a
sensation
before
going
down
the
woman
said
to
the
child
do
tell
anybody
about
the
boy
in
the
closet
no
i
wo
said
the
child
obediently
the
woman
hurried
down
stairs
but
her
husband
was
already
waiting
for
her
he
was
a
ruffian
with
a
rough
beard
of
a
week
growth
he
threw
himself
sullenly
into
a
chair
and
growled
where
were
you
you
always
out
of
the
way
when
i
come
home
i
just
went
up
stairs
a
minute
dick
she
answered
to
see
the
brat
i
suppose
yes
i
a
great
mind
to
knock
him
on
the
head
oh
dick
you
would
injure
the
little
innocent
she
said
earnestly
would
i
i
would
if
i
was
paid
enough
but
there
nothing
to
be
made
by
killing
him
thank
heaven
uttered
the
woman
fervently
you
have
got
the
heart
of
a
chicken
said
the
man
contemptuously
give
me
something
to
eat
i
hungry
the
woman
began
to
bustle
around
in
obedience
to
his
command
i
have
got
much
in
the
house
dick
she
said
apologetically
what
have
you
got
he
growled
some
eggs
and
a
little
bacon
shall
i
make
you
some
tea
no
bring
out
the
whisky
there
none
left
dick
the
man
uttered
an
oath
expressive
of
disappointment
well
give
me
some
slops
then
he
said
i
must
have
something
to
drink
did
you
shoot
anything
she
ventured
to
ask
i
have
been
hunting
i
thought
you
took
out
your
gun
what
if
i
did
i
do
always
hunt
when
i
take
my
gun
i
expected
to
hear
from
the
friends
of
that
brat
this
morning
but
i
did
they
must
hurry
up
with
their
money
if
they
do
want
me
to
strangle
him
perhaps
they
did
get
your
letter
dick
yes
they
did
i
took
care
of
that
i
they
hatching
up
some
plot
to
have
me
arrested
if
they
do
it
be
a
bad
day
for
the
brat
he
looked
fierce
and
brutal
enough
to
execute
the
dark
threat
at
which
he
indirectly
hinted
there
was
a
cruel
look
in
his
eye
which
showed
that
he
would
have
had
small
scruples
about
injuring
an
innocent
child
if
provoked
by
the
desire
for
revenge
while
his
wife
was
cooking
the
eggs
he
filled
his
pipe
and
began
to
smoke
she
made
all
the
haste
she
could
knowing
that
her
husband
was
far
from
patient
soon
the
frugal
repast
was
ready
she
set
it
on
the
table
and
said
it
all
ready
dick
better
eat
it
while
it
hot
i
eat
it
when
i
choose
he
growled
in
his
usual
spirit
of
contradiction
however
he
was
hungry
and
laying
aside
his
pipe
did
as
she
requested
soon
he
had
dispatched
all
the
food
set
before
him
there
is
enough
to
keep
a
kitten
from
starving
he
said
i
sorry
dick
much
you
are
sorry
he
growled
a
pretty
wife
you
are
i
wish
there
were
more
if
you
give
me
some
money
i
go
out
and
buy
something
money
he
snarled
you
always
wanting
money
do
you
think
i
am
made
of
money
no
dick
but
you
know
i
have
none
i
wish
i
knew
of
any
way
to
earn
it
you
do
yes
dick
then
i
suppose
you
be
leaving
me
he
said
suspiciously
no
i
would
you
know
i
would
dick
so
you
say
he
answered
brutally
how
the
brat
has
it
been
crying
no
it
is
a
very
good
child
i
go
up
and
take
a
look
at
it
he
arose
from
his
seat
and
advanced
toward
the
door
his
wife
followed
him
where
are
you
going
he
asked
turning
upon
her
i
going
up
too
she
answered
meekly
what
for
ca
you
trust
me
with
the
brat
yes
dick
but
it
is
much
used
to
you
you
might
frighten
it
and
make
it
cry
that
all
right
he
answered
smiling
grimly
i
like
to
hear
children
cry
how
can
you
enjoy
the
sufferings
of
a
child
halloo
what
that
he
said
looking
sharply
at
her
you
dare
to
find
fault
with
me
do
you
i
did
mean
that
dick
she
said
submissively
it
lucky
you
did
he
said
warningly
i
do
allow
none
of
that
wife
or
no
wife
may
i
go
up
if
you
want
to
so
the
two
went
up
stairs
together
the
wife
was
nervous
lest
the
child
in
some
way
might
excite
the
suspicions
of
her
husband
and
betray
the
presence
of
jasper
she
felt
therefore
very
ill
at
ease
the
child
was
sitting
up
in
bed
halloo
young
how
yer
gettin
along
asked
the
man
roughly
the
child
did
not
answer
but
looked
frightened
why
do
you
answer
demanded
the
man
frowning
the
child
looked
toward
the
woman
and
seemed
on
the
point
of
crying
ca
you
say
something
to
the
gentleman
said
the
woman
soothingly
thus
adjured
the
little
boy
said
wo
you
take
me
to
my
mamma
oh
yes
i
take
you
as
soon
as
your
mamma
sends
me
some
money
said
the
man
named
dick
and
she
better
do
it
pretty
soon
too
he
muttered
he
threw
himself
into
a
chair
and
ceased
to
notice
the
child
do
you
know
old
woman
he
said
in
a
different
tone
i
heard
news
that
rather
take
you
by
suprise
i
hope
it
is
good
news
said
his
wife
anxiously
well
that
as
may
be
he
answered
it
ought
to
be
good
news
for
us
but
there
no
saying
you
know
my
sister
mrs
thorne
yes
well
she
had
a
stroke
of
luck
how
was
that
well
you
see
she
went
as
governess
into
a
family
the
man
was
rich
and
an
invalid
a
widower
too
what
does
she
do
but
get
him
to
marry
her
she
has
been
fortunate
that
is
all
of
it
she
had
been
married
but
two
or
three
months
when
her
husband
died
leaving
her
a
third
of
his
property
and
guardian
to
his
son
who
inherits
the
rest
so
she
a
rich
woman
i
say
she
ought
to
do
something
for
her
brother
dick
do
you
say
so
i
think
she
would
be
willing
said
the
wife
she
ought
to
be
but
she
selfish
she
always
was
if
only
i
had
the
money
i
go
east
and
see
what
i
could
get
out
of
her
you
take
me
with
you
dick
no
i
would
it
be
all
i
can
do
to
raise
money
enough
to
pay
my
own
expenses
let
alone
yours
if
i
get
anything
i
come
back
and
you
get
your
share
that
why
i
want
the
parents
of
that
brat
to
fork
over
the
cash
pretty
quick
how
did
you
learn
the
news
about
your
sister
dick
an
old
pal
of
mine
has
just
come
from
that
way
and
told
me
all
about
it
every
word
of
this
dialogue
was
beard
by
jasper
in
his
place
of
concealment
he
was
astonished
beyond
measure
to
learn
that
this
ruffian
was
the
brother
of
his
no
wonder
i
do
like
her
he
thought
if
they
have
any
traits
in
common
what
a
fate
for
my
kind
and
gentle
father
to
marry
the
sister
of
such
a
man
i
glad
of
it
said
his
wife
well
so
am
i
if
she
do
the
right
thing
by
me
but
if
she
do
then
i
sorry
what
shall
i
do
when
you
away
dick
get
along
as
well
as
you
can
folks
give
you
victuals
if
you
get
hard
up
i
do
like
to
beg
wish
me
good
luck
then
and
money
enough
to
take
care
of
you
what
are
you
starin
at
young
this
he
said
to
the
child
whose
eyes
as
if
by
a
species
of
fascination
were
fixed
upon
him
take
me
home
to
mamma
pleaded
the
child
beginning
to
cry
shut
up
said
the
ruffian
harshly
striding
to
the
bed
and
pinching
the
boy
arm
till
he
cried
with
the
pain
oh
do
dick
pleaded
the
woman
who
was
fond
of
children
though
she
had
never
been
a
mother
i
give
the
brat
something
to
cry
for
said
her
husband
and
he
pinched
him
again
oh
dick
how
can
you
torture
the
poor
child
said
his
wife
braver
in
the
little
boy
defence
than
in
her
own
what
business
has
it
to
cry
then
i
like
to
choke
it
if
you
hush
i
serve
you
the
same
way
jasper
had
listened
to
this
brutality
as
long
as
he
could
but
his
indignation
became
too
hot
to
be
repressed
thoughtless
of
consequences
he
burst
open
the
closet
door
and
strode
into
the
presence
of
the
astonished
ruffian
his
fists
involuntarily
clenched
and
his
eyes
kindling
with
indignation
chapter
xx
a
strange
commission
the
man
whom
we
have
called
dick
stopped
short
and
gazed
in
astonishment
at
the
boy
who
had
so
fearlessly
stepped
upon
the
scene
where
did
you
come
from
he
demanded
frowning
from
that
closet
answered
jasper
how
came
you
there
what
business
have
you
in
my
house
anyway
demanded
the
ruffian
i
entered
it
supposing
it
to
be
deserted
said
jasper
while
i
was
below
i
heard
that
poor
boy
cry
and
came
up
did
you
know
he
was
here
asked
the
ruffian
turning
to
his
wife
and
speaking
menacingly
yes
dick
why
did
you
let
him
in
he
came
in
while
i
was
out
why
did
you
tell
me
he
was
here
because
i
did
want
him
injured
in
any
way
i
was
afraid
you
would
be
angry
with
him
that
is
where
you
are
right
said
dick
adding
an
oath
the
young
scoundrel
shall
pay
for
his
impudence
in
entering
my
house
like
a
thief
you
have
no
right
to
say
that
said
jasper
i
have
explained
to
you
why
i
came
here
you
hid
in
the
closet
intending
to
come
out
and
steal
when
we
were
out
of
the
way
what
could
i
steal
asked
jasper
looking
around
him
do
you
mean
to
taunt
me
with
my
poverty
exclaimed
the
ruffian
enraged
no
i
am
poorer
than
you
you
look
like
it
it
is
true
i
was
robbed
in
the
cars
by
a
pickpocket
and
because
i
was
penniless
and
could
not
pay
my
fare
i
was
put
off
at
this
station
is
this
true
demanded
dick
with
a
searching
look
yes
i
wish
it
were
not
how
came
you
near
this
house
i
set
out
to
walk
to
the
village
and
must
have
lost
my
way
why
did
you
come
out
of
that
closet
was
the
next
demand
because
i
heard
you
abusing
that
little
boy
said
jasper
fearlessly
i
have
a
right
to
do
what
i
please
to
my
own
child
it
is
your
child
what
do
you
mean
by
that
you
impudent
young
jackanapes
unobserved
by
her
husband
the
wife
made
a
warning
sign
to
jasper
not
to
provoke
the
man
whose
evil
passion
she
so
well
knew
jasper
comprehended
the
sign
but
it
did
not
influence
him
frank
and
fearless
by
temperament
he
thought
it
his
duty
to
stand
between
the
little
boy
and
this
ruffian
brutality
still
he
appreciated
the
woman
kindness
and
resolved
to
bear
it
in
mind
indeed
he
saw
that
she
was
rather
to
be
pitied
than
blamed
her
natural
instincts
were
good
but
she
was
under
the
control
of
a
bad
man
i
heard
what
you
were
saying
said
jasper
you
heard
yes
while
i
was
in
the
closet
what
did
you
hear
you
young
scoundrel
demanded
the
ruffian
enough
to
satisfy
me
that
you
have
stolen
this
boy
from
his
parents
it
a
lie
no
it
is
the
truth
i
felt
sure
of
it
before
and
now
i
know
it
you
took
him
in
order
to
extort
money
from
his
friends
well
said
the
ruffian
defiantly
what
if
i
did
have
you
anything
to
say
against
it
yes
said
jasper
i
shall
have
to
wring
your
neck
by
and
by
muttered
dick
well
go
on
spit
out
what
you
got
to
say
i
say
it
a
cruel
wrong
to
the
parents
said
jasper
boldly
and
to
the
child
also
but
you
make
it
worse
when
you
try
to
abuse
the
boy
come
boy
if
you
care
so
much
for
the
brat
suppose
you
take
his
place
and
take
the
beating
i
was
going
to
give
him
suggested
the
ruffian
mockingly
i
would
rather
suffer
than
have
him
suffer
said
jasper
quietly
but
perhaps
you
will
change
your
mind
when
you
hear
what
i
have
to
say
oh
you
are
going
to
beg
off
sneered
the
ruffian
with
a
look
of
satisfaction
i
thought
you
come
to
your
senses
you
are
mistaken
as
to
my
intention
i
want
to
speak
to
you
about
your
sister
formerly
mrs
thorne
what
do
you
know
about
her
asked
the
man
in
extreme
astonishment
a
good
deal
she
is
my
what
are
you
the
son
of
the
man
she
married
asked
dick
eagerly
i
am
jasper
kent
that
the
name
so
she
sent
you
out
to
me
did
she
that
better
than
i
thought
she
has
forgotten
her
brother
after
all
no
you
are
mistaken
said
jasper
she
never
so
much
as
told
me
she
had
a
brother
dick
looked
disappointed
then
with
sudden
suspicion
he
said
roughly
i
believe
you
are
lying
this
jasper
kent
is
rich
the
heir
of
of
his
father
property
you
say
you
are
penniless
that
is
true
both
stories
are
true
i
am
my
father
principal
heir
but
your
sister
is
my
guardian
she
has
treated
me
in
such
a
way
that
i
left
the
house
ran
away
eh
no
i
gave
her
full
notice
of
what
i
should
do
i
told
her
that
if
i
were
decently
treated
i
would
stay
but
if
she
continued
to
insult
me
and
give
the
preference
in
all
things
to
her
own
boy
nicholas
i
would
go
away
you
have
been
such
a
fool
as
to
go
off
and
leave
all
your
property
in
her
hands
i
shall
come
in
possession
of
it
when
i
am
till
then
i
will
try
to
support
myself
come
boy
you
plucky
i
glad
you
came
after
all
i
want
to
hear
more
about
my
sister
affairs
come
down
stairs
and
we
talk
dick
appeared
suddenly
to
have
forgotten
his
animosity
he
became
even
friendly
in
his
manner
as
he
gave
our
hero
this
invitation
old
woman
said
he
addressing
his
wife
ca
you
rake
up
something
for
this
boy
to
eat
i
dare
say
he
is
hungry
i
do
think
we
got
anything
more
in
the
house
i
go
out
directly
and
get
something
come
down
boy
i
want
to
ask
you
a
few
more
questions
they
went
down
stairs
followed
by
the
wife
she
was
happily
relieved
by
the
unexpected
good
understanding
between
her
husband
and
jasper
now
tell
me
said
dick
eagerly
when
they
were
in
the
lower
room
how
much
property
has
my
sister
got
probably
between
thirty
and
forty
thousand
dollars
as
much
as
that
said
dick
complacently
well
she
has
feathered
her
nest
well
i
do
like
kent
said
jasper
though
she
is
your
sister
i
am
obliged
to
say
that
but
it
is
not
at
all
on
account
of
the
property
my
father
left
her
if
he
had
given
her
his
estate
i
would
not
have
complained
as
long
as
she
treated
me
fairly
helen
was
always
a
hard
customer
she
got
a
will
of
her
own
chuckled
dick
there
was
no
hope
of
our
getting
on
together
said
jasper
she
ought
to
do
something
for
me
do
you
think
so
i
her
only
brother
as
to
that
said
jasper
my
opinion
would
have
any
weight
with
her
if
you
are
poor
and
need
help
it
would
be
only
natural
for
her
to
help
you
that
the
way
to
talk
you
wo
say
anything
against
me
to
her
certainly
not
said
jasper
i
shall
not
write
to
her
at
all
and
even
if
i
did
i
would
try
to
interfere
with
her
disposing
of
her
property
in
any
way
she
thinks
best
come
you
a
trump
after
all
i
like
you
you
plucky
too
thank
you
i
say
a
good
word
for
you
to
my
sister
when
i
see
her
you
better
not
said
jasper
if
she
thinks
you
are
friendly
to
me
you
stand
a
poor
chance
of
any
favors
better
abuse
me
dick
roared
with
laughter
i
say
youngster
you
a
smart
i
see
you
friendly
by
your
hint
i
abuse
you
to
her
never
fear
you
must
take
a
drink
on
that
say
old
woman
where
the
whisky
there
not
a
drop
in
the
house
dick
i
forgot
curse
the
luck
just
then
a
man
entered
the
house
only
less
than
dick
himself
he
held
a
letter
in
his
hand
dick
seized
it
eagerly
it
from
the
father
of
the
boy
he
said
the
letter
proved
to
contain
fifty
dollars
i
send
this
in
advance
said
the
writer
when
the
boy
is
safely
delivered
into
my
hands
a
hundred
and
fifty
more
will
be
paid
to
the
one
who
brings
him
and
no
questions
asked
herman
fitch
good
said
dick
as
far
as
it
goes
i
ready
to
give
up
the
brat
but
will
his
father
keep
faith
perhaps
he
have
the
police
on
hand
ready
to
nab
me
have
you
anybody
to
send
anybody
you
can
trust
dick
slapped
his
knee
forcibly
an
idea
had
come
to
him
i
send
him
in
charge
of
the
brat
he
said
pointing
to
jasper
chapter
xxi
jasper
is
intrusted
with
a
delicate
commission
look
here
boy
said
dick
do
you
want
a
job
yes
said
jasper
if
it
honest
no
fear
of
that
i
want
you
to
take
that
boy
home
to
his
father
i
do
it
said
jasper
eagerly
how
much
pay
do
you
want
none
at
all
except
money
to
pay
my
fare
in
the
cars
you
the
right
sort
said
dick
with
satisfaction
but
another
matter
i
got
to
think
about
how
do
i
know
but
you
will
betray
me
how
put
the
police
on
my
track
if
you
had
given
up
the
boy
i
might
said
jasper
frankly
dick
regarded
him
attentively
you
bold
he
said
then
you
wo
betray
me
now
no
promise
it
i
promise
that
is
if
you
send
the
boy
home
by
me
all
right
that
understood
now
for
another
matter
read
that
letter
jasper
read
the
letter
of
herman
fitch
already
quoted
you
see
this
man
the
boy
father
agrees
to
pay
one
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
when
he
is
given
up
i
see
that
he
will
give
you
that
money
that
is
if
he
means
fair
and
you
will
bring
it
to
me
do
you

a
little
out
of

in
the
directory
so
you
wo
have
any
trouble
in
finding
it
how
glad
he
will
be
to
see
the
little
boy
again
he
ought
to
be
you
do
think
he

out
from
his
agreement
said
dick
suspiciously
no
he
be
so
glad
to
see
the
child
he
will
care
nothing
for
the
money
that
what
i
hope
when
i
get
that
money
i
going
east
you

dick
asked
his
wife
what

dick
it
cost
more
what

i
do

be
so
lonely
dick
she
persisted

my
way
what
blubbering
plague

all
the
women

say

go
said
jasper
there
a
train
this
afternoon
take
that
for
the
sooner
matters
are
arranged
the
better
here
five
dollars
it
be
more
than
enough
to
pay
your
fare
but
you
better
have
it
in
case
anything
happens
jasper
felt
some
repugnance
in
taking
money
acquired
in
such
a
way
but
it
seemed
necessary
and
he
thrust
the
note
into
his
you
be
able
to
carry
the
boy
back
said
dick
at
twelve
bring
the
money
to
this
address
he
handed
him
a
card
with
the
name
mark
mortimer
no
s
street
scrawled
on
it
in
pencil

i
to
ask
for

mortimer

jasper
yes

it
one
of
my
names

fail
i
wo
if
you

play
me
false

never
have
been
born
said
the
kidnapper
menacingly
i
come
not
on
account
of
your
threats
but
because
i
have
promised
said
jasper
quietly
you
a
plucky
boy

of
the
sort

dick
with
respect
for
the
boy
courage

jasper
laughing

said
jasper

the
right
thing
by
me

a
model
citizen

dick
said
his
wife
let
the
world
give
me
a
chance
then
now
boy
you
must
be
starting
harry
said
jasper
to
the
little
boy
whose
name
he
had
learned
do
you
want
to
go
with
me
the
little
boy
confidingly
put
his
arms
round
our
hero
neck
will
you
take
me
to
my
mamma
he
asked
yes
i
will
take
you
to
her
the
little
boy
uttered
a
cry
of
delight
me
all
ready
he
said
eagerly
do
you
think
he
can
walk
to
the
depot
asked
jasper
yes
it
is
only
a
mile
or
so
then
i
will
start
part
of
the
way
he
carried
the
little
boy
in
his
arms
they
could
make
but
slow
progress
but
luckily
there
was
plenty
of
time
and
they
reached
the
depot
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
the
train
started
the
looked
at
the
two
with
curiosity
is
that
boy
yours
he
is
my
son
if
that
what
you
mean
said
jasper
amused
brother
then
no
he
a
friend
of
mine
that
i
taking
home
to
his
father
and
mother
been
makin
a
visit
around
here
asked
the
yes
replied
jasper
briefly
the
arrival
of
two
passengers
who
wanted
tickets
relieved
him
from
the
questions
of
the
curious
he
might
have
asked
questions
which
it
would
have
been
inconvenient
to
answer
did
you
ever
ride
in
the
cars
harry
asked
jasper
i
did
ride
in
the
cars
when
the
ugly
man
took
me
from
my
mamma
was
that
the
only
time
the
little
boy
could
remember
no
other
jasper
led
him
a
little
away
to
avoid
questioning
but
was
back
in
time
to
enter
the
cars
when
the
train
arrived
he
found
a
vacant
seat
and
gave
the
little
boy
the
place
next
the
window
there
were
many
admiring
glances
directed
toward
the
little
fellow
who
was
remarkably
handsome
jasper
was
apprehensive
lest
the
boy
should
be
recognized
by
some
one
who
knew
him
this
would
have
brought
suspicion
upon
him
and
placed
him
in
a
very
embarrassing
position
fortunately
though
the
appearance
was
much
admired
no
such
recognition
took
place
two
hours
later
they
rolled
into
the
central
depot
at
louis
now
thought
jasper
i
must
find
out
as
soon
as
possible
where
fitch
lives
jasper
had
not
been
much
of
a
traveller
as
we
know
finding
himself
now
in
a
strange
city
he
felt
at
first
a
little
bewildered
the
more
so
that
he
had
a
young
child
under
his
charge
he
did
not
know
in
which
direction
the
boy
father
lived
but
the
natural
thought
occurred
to
him
that
he
could
find
his
name
in
the
directory
he
went
into
a
saloon
and
asked
will
you
let
me
see
your
directory
i
got
no
directory
answered
the
burly
dutchman
who
presided
over
the
saloon
i
can
give
you
lager
not
at
present
said
jasper
laughing
we
do
drink
it
occurred
to
him
that
it
might
be
as
well
to
get
into
the
central
part
of
the
city
he
accordingly
hailed
a
passing
car
and
got
aboard
with
harry
after
awhile
he
judged
from
the
appearance
of
the
buildings
that
he
had
reached
one
of
the
principal
streets
he
descended
from
the
car
lifting
harry
carefully
down
and
carrying
him
in
his
arms
to
the
sidewalk
there
was
a
large
and
imposing
store
situated
at
the
corner
of
the
street
they
must
have
a
directory
in
there
thought
jasper
he
entered
holding
the
little
boy
by
the
hand
what
was
his
surprise
when
a
lady
turning
and
catching
sight
of
the
child
sprang
to
him
seized
him
in
her
arms
and
began
to
cry
and
laugh
alternately
but
the
mystery
was
explained
when
he
heard
harry
say
oh
mamma
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
chapter
xxii
a
business
man
suspicions
jasper
stood
at
a
little
distance
witnessing
the
happy
meeting
between
the
mother
and
child
he
did
not
wish
to
interrupt
their
happiness
soon
however
the
mother
looked
up
and
then
jasper
advanced
raising
his
hat
politely
is
this
mrs
fitch
he
asked
yes
said
the
lady
surveying
him
with
curiosity
then
i
have
great
pleasure
in
restoring
to
you
your
child
what
did
he
come
with
you
yes
madam
did
you
know
i
was
in
here
no
i
only
came
in
to
consult
the
directory
to
learn
your
residence
how
could
you
be
so
wicked
as
to
steal
my
boy
demanded
fitch
with
pardonable
indignation
judging
that
jasper
was
the
kidnapper
i
would
have
done
it
for
five
thousand
dollars
said
jasper
impetuously
he
did
me
mamma
said
little
harry
coming
opportunely
to
jasper
defense
who
did
then
my
darling
it
was
big
ugly
man
jasper
good
boy
kind
to
harry
fitch
prompt
to
remedy
her
injustice
held
out
her
hand
to
jasper
which
he
took
respectfully
excuse
me
she
said
but
i
thought
as
harry
was
with
you
that
you
had
been
concerned
in
his
kidnapping
i
never
saw
him
till
this
morning
said
jasper
chance
drew
me
to
a
lonely
house
where
he
was
confined
and
you
rescued
him
how
can
i
thank
you
i
would
have
done
so
if
i
could
but
i
ca
take
the
credit
of
it
your
husband
offered
a
reward
which
the
kidnapper
thought
best
to
accept
he
did
not
dare
to
bring
him
back
himself
and
having
no
one
else
to
employ
asked
me
to
become
his
agent
in
restoring
him
of
course
i
was
very
glad
to
do
it
it
was
not
chance
that
directed
you
to
the
haunt
of
these
wicked
men
it
was
a
good
and
merciful
providence
did
they
my
darling
i
found
him
tied
to
the
bed
in
which
he
was
lying
how
could
they
treat
you
so
my
dear
boy
said
the
mother
piteously
may
i
ask
your
name
this
was
of
course
addressed
to
jasper
my
name
is
jasper
kent
can
you
come
out
and
stop
at
our
house
over
night
we
live
about
two
miles
distant
i
want
my
husband
to
see
you
and
thank
you
for
bringing
back
our
darling
boy
jasper
reflected
that
he
must
see
fitch
at
any
rate
in
order
to
obtain
the
promised
reward
moreover
he
had
no
means
of
his
own
to
pay
for
a
lodging
and
he
promptly
accepted
the
offer
i
will
return
home
at
once
said
fitch
i
came
in
to
make
some
purchases
but
i
ca
think
of
those
now
come
mr
kent
take
hold
of
my
hand
said
little
harry
to
jasper
jasper
smilingly
took
the
proffered
hand
and
harry
happy
in
the
double
companionship
went
out
of
the
store
there
was
a
handsome
carriage
in
waiting
with
a
coachman
in
livery
perched
on
the
box
edward
said
fitch
her
face
fairly
glowing
with
delight
do
you
see
little
harry
has
come
back
so
he
has
heaven
bless
him
said
the
coachman
heartily
how
do
you
do
master
harry
i
pooty
well
answered
the
little
boy
where
did
you
find
him
if
i
may
be
so
bold
this
young
gentleman
brought
him
back
edward
now
drive
right
home
wo
you
go
around
to
the
office
and
tell
master
no
he
must
have
left
the
office
by
this
time
we
shall
see
him
at
supper
half
an
hour
later
the
carriage
drew
up
in
front
of
a
handsome
residence
far
enough
from
the
centre
of
the
city
to
have
a
side
yard
of
considerable
dimensions
in
the
rear
of
which
stood
a
brick
stable
it
was
clear
that
fitch
was
a
man
of
wealth
so
jasper
decided
of
the
sensation
produced
in
the
house
by
harry
arrival
i
will
not
speak
jasper
found
himself
regarded
in
the
light
of
the
heroic
deliverer
of
the
little
boy
from
captivity
though
he
laughingly
disclaimed
the
credit
attaching
to
such
a
character
they
had
been
home
but
fifteen
minutes
when
fitch
arrived
at
the
moment
of
his
arrival
jasper
was
in
a
handsome
chamber
on
the
second
floor
which
had
been
assigned
to
his
use
preparing
himself
for
dinner
fitch
was
overjoyed
at
the
recovery
of
his
little
boy
but
he
listened
with
some
incredulity
to
the
praises
lavished
upon
jasper
by
his
wife
you
do
seem
to
realize
he
said
that
this
young
hero
of
yours
is
a
companion
and
acknowledged
agent
of
a
kidnapper
wait
till
you
see
him
said
fitch
confidently
fitch
shrugged
his
shoulders
how
the
women
are
carried
away
by
a
specious
appearance
he
thought
i
am
a
man
of
the
world
and
cooler
in
my
judgment
yet
when
jasper
entered
the
room
he
could
not
help
acknowledging
that
his
appearance
was
very
much
in
his
favor
frank
and
manly
in
his
looks
he
met
fitch
with
gentlemanly
ease
you
are
the
young
gentleman
who
brought
back
my
little
boy
i
believe
said
the
father
yes
sir
said
jasper
i
occupy
for
the
time
being
the
office
of
agent
of
the
man
who
kidnapped
him
who
is
this
man
i
should
be
willing
to
tell
you
if
i
had
not
promised
secrecy
then
said
fitch
with
slight
suspicion
you
are
in
confidential
relations
with
this
villain
partly
so
but
it
was
forced
upon
me
i
never
met
him
till
and
he
confided
in
me
because
there
seemed
to
be
no
one
else
that
he
could
trust
why
did
he
not
come
himself
because
he
thought
it
would
be
dangerous
shall
you
meet
him
again
once
only
to
finish
this
business
he
said
you
had
promised
a
certain
sum
on
the
boy
return
and
this
i
agreed
to
carry
him
how
much
commission
are
you
to
receive
inquired
fitch
nothing
at
all
said
jasper
he
handed
me
five
dollars
to
pay
the
railroad
fare
of
little
harry
and
myself
to
louis
what
is
left
over
i
shall
return
to
him
then
harry
was
not
concealed
in
this
city
no
sir
but
he
was
at
no
great
distance
from
it
are
you
living
here
i
never
was
in
louis
until
this
afternoon
i
have
only
just
come
on
from
the
state
of
new
york
to
find
employment
i
suppose
yes
sir
it
was
by
the
merest
chance
that
i
fell
over
your
little
boy
and
his
captor
i
was
contriving
plans
for
getting
him
away
when
fortunately
the
kidnapper
received
a
communication
from
you
which
led
to
my
being
here
suppose
you
had
got
harry
away
from
this
man
how
could
you
have
found
me
that
would
have
been
the
difficulty
i
did
know
your
name
or
where
you
lived
but
i
meant
to
come
here
and
get
one
of
the
daily
papers
to
publish
an
account
of
the
recovery
in
the
hope
that
the
paragraph
would
find
its
way
to
your
notice
a
very
sensible
plan
commented
fitch
approvingly
when
have
you
agreed
to
meet
the
kidnapper
to
carry
him
the
money
at
twelve
and
then
you
will
proceed
to
carry
out
your
own
plans
yes
sir
after
supper
if
you
can
spare
the
time
i
will
tell
you
my
situation
and
the
circumstances
that
led
me
here
and
ask
for
advice
very
well
i
will
gladly
give
you
the
best
counsel
i
can
after
supper
jasper
told
his
story
briefly
and
confirmed
the
favorable
impression
he
had
already
begun
to
make
fitch
cast
aside
his
lingering
remnant
of
suspicion
and
promised
his
good
offices
in
procuring
him
employment
after
you
have
seen
this
man
and
paid
him
the
money
he
said
come
to
my
and
we
will
talk
over
your
affairs
the
evening
was
spent
socially
little
harry
of
course
being
the
central
object
of
interest
the
little
fellow
appeared
to
have
taken
a
great
fancy
to
jasper
and
was
unwilling
to
have
him
go
the
next
day
he
was
not
reconciled
till
jasper
promised
to
come
back
chapter
xxiii
where
jasper
found
dick
to
find
the
address
given
by
the
kidnapper
was
not
difficult
it
was
only
necessary
to
look
over
a
plan
of
the
city
which
jasper
did
in
fitch
come
back
when
your
business
is
over
said
the
merchant
i
will
said
jasper
he
set
out
with
one
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
in
his
pocket
for
s
street
we
will
precede
him
it
was
a
shabby
house
of
two
stories
with
a
wide
front
it
looked
dilapidated
and
neglected
but
except
that
it
was
in
an
unsavory
neighborhood
there
was
nothing
to
draw
attention
to
it
or
lead
to
the
impression
that
it
was
the
haunt
of
lawbreakers
and
desperate
characters
in
a
back
room
sat
three
men
one
of
whom
we
recognize
as
the
kidnapper
dick
alias
mark
mortimer
of
the
other
two
one
was
under
with
a
reckless
look
as
of
one
who
would
stop
at
little
in
his
criminal
schemes
he
had
more
than
once
been
engaged
in
burglary
but
as
yet
had
escaped
detection
the
third
was
a
stout
man
of
middle
age
with
a
heavy
brutal
face
such
as
might
belong
to
a
he
too
was
a
burglar
an
accomplished
counterfeiter
a
gambler
who
supplemented
luck
by
various
swindling
devices
in
which
he
was
an
adept
this
man
was
known
as
slippery
bill
while
his
young
companion
was
jack
with
a
choice
of
last
names
the
three
men
were
playing
a
game
of
euchre
with
a
pack
of
greasy
cards
the
time
was
eleven
in
the
forenoon
it
most
time
for
the
boy
to
come
said
dick
looking
toward
the
clock
how
do
you
know
but
he
give
you
the
slip
suggested
jack
if
he
did
i
break
his
neck
exclaimed
dick
hastily
but
he
wo
leastways
he
wo
if
he
can
help
it
it
strikes
me
dick
said
bill
that
you
ought
never
to
have
asked
him
to
come
here
why
not
who
to
tell
but
he
may
bring
company
continued
the
stout
man
what
kind
of
company
the
police
he
wo
said
dick
how
do
you
know
i
trust
him
he
a
good
how
long
have
you
known
him
that
you
speak
with
so
much
confidence
inquired
the
younger
man
since
yesterday
morning
answered
dick
cornered
the
two
men
burst
into
a
boisterous
laugh
why
dick
you
as
innocent
as
a
baby
you
have
knowed
this
chap
hours
and
you
stake
your
life
on
him
laugh
as
much
as
you
like
said
dick
stubbornly
i
ought
to
speak
up
for
my
own
nephew
your
nephew
exclaimed
his
two
companions
in
surprise
what
do
you
mean
what
i
say
he
my
sister
son
a
minute
ago
you
said
you
never
saw
him
till
yesterday
said
the
stout
man
suspiciously
no
more
i
did
my
sister
lives
at
the
east
has
she
sent
him
to
you
to
be
brought
up
in
the
way
he
should
go
asked
jack
with
a
sneer
no
the
boy
run
away
he
came
across
me
by
chance
that
better
said
bill
partially
reassured
he
wo
be
likely
to
betray
you
not
now
but
he
may
inform
against
this
place
i
answer
for
him
are
you
going
to
let
him
go
as
soon
as
he
brings
the
money
or
will
he
stay
with
you
oh
he
go
i
ca
take
care
of
a
lad
like
him
i
other
fish
to
fry
suppose
we
keep
him
and
train
him
up
to
our
business
he
ai
the
right
sort
for
that
shows
the
white
feather
eh
no
he
as
brave
as
any
boy
i
ever
saw
what
the
matter
then
he
too
honest
and
virtuous
what
your
nephew
dick
and
the
two
men
laughed
loudly
that
too
thin
do
ask
us
to
swallow
that
it
true
why
did
he
run
away
from
home
then
my
sister
got
a
very
rough
temper
that
why
we
can
believe
that
said
jack
better
than
the
other
look
here
jack
said
dick
who
was
getting
irritated
you
may
find
that
i
got
the
same
kind
of
temper
if
you
keep
on
badgering
me
about
the
boy
i
say
he
to
be
trusted
he
can
be
trusted
under
our
eye
have
you
any
objection
to
our
detaining
him
there
no
need
i
say
there
is
you
let
him
into
the
knowledge
of
this
place
blow
on
us
some
day
do
as
you
like
said
dick
i
do
care
i
wash
my
hands
of
the
responsibility
that
all
we
want
said
bill
we
need
a
young
one
to
help
us
in
our
plans
if
this
nephew
of
yours
is
as
brave
as
you
say
he
do
what
time
was
he
to
come
here
twelve
then
it
a
minute
past
the
time
i
do
think
he
come
the
clock
may
be
wrong
said
dick
but
he
glanced
uneasily
at
the
clock
which
now
indicated
a
little
past
the
hour
his
suspense
was
not
a
long
one
an
old
man
thin
and
shriveled
with
a
crafty
eye
and
a
thin
squeaking
voice
here
put
his
head
in
at
the
door
is
mark
mortimer
here
he
asked
that
me
exclaimed
dick
jumping
up
eagerly
there
a
boy
wants
to
see
you
mark
mortimer
said
the
old
man
repeating
the
name
as
if
he
enjoyed
it
it
my
nephew
said
dick
is
his
name
mortimer
too
asked
the
proprietor
of
the
establishment
for
such
the
old
man
was
never
mind
said
dick
impatiently
bring
the
boy
in
almost
directly
jasper
was
ushered
into
the
room
fearlessly
but
looking
about
him
with
some
curiosity
the
two
men
who
had
not
before
seen
him
surveyed
him
with
equal
curiosity
he
does
you
credit
said
the
stout
man
he
what
i
was
at
his
age
said
dick
now
boy
have
you
got
the
money
yes
said
jasper
one
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
yes
dick
eyes
glistened
give
it
here
you
a
trump
did
old
fitch
make
any
difficulties
no
he
was
glad
to
get
the
boy
back
did
he
ask
you
about
me
yes
how
much
did
you
tell
him
demanded
the
kidnapper
hastily
nothing
i
told
him
that
i
had
made
a
promise
not
to
tell
dick
looked
triumphantly
at
his
two
companions
did
i
tell
you
he
said
you
have
the
boy
word
for
it
said
jack
with
a
quiet
sneer
how
did
you
find
your
way
here
boy
i
looked
at
a
map
of
the
city
answered
jasper
where
in
the
office
of
mr
fitch
where
did
you
pass
last
night
at
the
house
of
mr
fitch
where

you
going
when
you
leave
here
i
have
promised
to
go
to
fitch
you
seem
to
be
very
intimate
with
this
gentleman
said
jack
there
nothing
strange
in
that
said
jasper
quietly
it
was
i
who
carried
his
boy
home
the
boy
is
right
said
dick
who
having
obtained
his
money
felt
graciously
disposed
toward
our
hero
through
whose
agency
he
had
obtained
it
what
does
he
want
of
you
asked
jack
continuing
the
i
hope
he
is
going
to
help
me
to
a
place
answered
jasper
no
need
of
going
to
him
said
the
stout
man
we
give
you
employment
you
repeated
jasper
with
an
attentive
glance
which
took
in
the
man
disreputable
appearance
yes
if
you
deserve
it
what
do
you
say
i
feel
obliged
for
your
offer
said
jasper
but
having
promised
fitch
to
return
i
would
prefer
to
do
so
boys
interrupted
dick
at
this
point
i
sorry
to
leave
this
festive
crowd
but
i
got
other
business
to
attend
to
and
must
be
going
i
go
with
you
said
jasper
who
was
anxious
to
leave
the
place
no
you
do
just
yet
said
jack
rising
and
striding
between
jasper
and
the
door
we
have
a
drink
all
around
first
thank
you
said
jasper
i
do
drink
you
must
drink

it
the
law
of
this
establishment
all
right
jasper
said
dick
i
treat
you
can
drink
what
you
like
though
jasper
felt
that
it
would
be
politic
to
comply
and
chose
lemonade
i
order
the
drinks
said
jack
and
he
left
the
room
for
that
purpose
chapter
xxiv
the
sleeping
potion
presently
the
old
man
already
referred
to
appeared
with
the
drinks
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
say
that
jasper
was
alone
in
his
choice
of
lemonade
the
rest
selected
stronger
liquors
here
to
you
dick
said
jack
tossing
off
the
contents
of
his
glass
and
may
you
live
to
treat
us
many
times
more
amen
to
that
said
bill
have
you
got
anything
to
say
youngster
asked
dick
turning
to
jasper
i
wish
you
a
pleasant
journey
said
jasper
politely
as
to
that
it
depends
on
my
success
with
my
sister
when
do
you
leave
if
i
can
what
all
that
about
dick
are
you
going
to
leave
us
asked
bill
i
goin
east
for
the
benefit
of
my
health
and
my
purse
said
dick
with
a
grin
do
you
wish
me
success
mates
to
be
sure
is
it
anything
we
can
help
you
in
no
no
it
my
private
venture
anything
in
my
line
no
it
a
strictly
virtuous
and
honest
undertaking
i
do
mind
giving
you
a
hint
of
it
i
got
a
near
relative
that
come
into
a
fortune
now
i
think
i
ought
to
come
in
for
a
share
to
be
sure
have
another
game
of
euchre
dick
i
do
know
i
ought
to
be
going
said
the
kidnapper
hesitating
we
make
it
poker
and
the
boy
may
take
a
hand
no
said
jasper
languidly
i
do
know
how
to
play
we
teach
you
i
do
care
about
it
you
look
sleepy
lad
said
dick
yes
i
feel
so
it
strange
i
did
feel
so
when
i
came
in
oh
do
mind
the
boy
looks
said
jack
lay
down
on
that
settee
if
you
want
to
boy
jasper
felt
so
heavy
and
drowsy
that
he
accepted
the
permission
and
stretched
himself
out
closing
his
eyes
why
am
i
so
sleepy
he
thought
languidly
i
never
was
before
in
the
middle
of
the
day
except
when
i
was
sick
he
listened
at
first
to
the
conversation
between
the
players
but
gradually
it
sounded
only
like
a
confused
hum
and
at
length
he
could
not
hear
it
at
all
he
was
fast
asleep
when
this
became
clear
through
his
heavy
breathing
dick
turned
to
the
younger
man
and
pointing
to
jasper
asked
what
have
you
been
doing
to
him
i
put
a
sleeping
potion
into
his
drink
answered
jack
what
for
i
mean
to
keep
him
for
a
while
and
that
saves
a
fuss
what
do
you
want
to
do
with
him
prevent
him
from
doing
mischief
there
no
need
he
can
be
trusted
you
can
trust
him
for
you
be
a
long
way
off
he
might
blow
on
us
any
time
dick
shrugged
his
shoulders
oh
well
do
as
you
please
but
you
over
careful
do
hurt
him
he
be
all
right
as
long
as
he
behaves
himself
it
your
deal
the
game
was
over
at
last
and
dick
arose
to
go
jasper
was
sleeping
soundly
and
was
wholly
unconscious
of
his
departure
give
me
a
hand
bill
and
we
take
the
boy
up
stairs
said
the
younger
man
what
your
plan
jack
to
make
him
one
of
us
he
come
to
it
in
time
there
was
a
windowless
room
on
the
second
floor
in
the
centre
of
the
house
wholly
dark
except
when
lighted
by
gas
it
was
to
this
room
that
our
hero
was
conveyed
and
laid
upon
some
bedding
in
the
corner
of
the
room
there
was
a
slide
in
the
partition
to
admit
air
and
with
it
a
few
faint
rays
of
light
jasper
stirred
a
little
while
he
was
being
moved
but
the
sleeping
potion
had
too
much
potency
to
allow
him
to
wake
there
said
jack
in
a
tone
of
satisfaction
he
safe
now
he
make
a
fuss
when
he
gets
up
let
him
he
ca
get
out
as
they
went
down
stairs
jack
called
aside
nathan
gibson
the
old
man
who
had
charge
of
the
house
nathan
said
he
did
you
see
the
boy
that
was
with
us
just
now
yes
we
put
him
in
the
prison
for
this
was
the
name
by
which
the
small
dark
room
was
known
he
not
to
be
let
out
good
i
understand
you
may
take
him
some
supper
at
five
or
six
look
in
before
that
time
to
see
if
he
awake
all
right
said
the
old
man
grinning
what
your
game
it
your
game
as
well
as
mine
the
boy
ought
never
to
have
come
here
he
may
blow
on
us
the
little
man
looked
by
turns
frightened
and
fierce
i
slit
his
throat
if
he
did
he
said
no
need
of
that
we
make
him
join
us
that
would
be
the
best
way
but
can
you
we
can
try
do
forget
what
i
told
you
nathan
nodded
still
jasper
slept
little
suspecting
into
what
a
trap
he
had
walked
chapter
xxv
jasper
finds
himself
a
prisoner
it
was
after
five
when
jasper
opened
his
eyes
as
soon
as
consciousness
returned
he
looked
around
him
with
astonishment
and
wonder
where
am
i
a
few
rays
of
light
entered
at
the
above
and
to
this
his
eyes
were
naturally
drawn
here
was
another
puzzle
he
explored
his
memory
and
could
recall
no
such
place
as
this
he
had
never
before
been
in
such
a
room
at
last
he
recalled
the
circumstances
under
which
he
fell
asleep
and
he
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
he
was
in
the
same
house
still
they
must
have
put
me
to
bed
he
said
to
himself
they
were
very
kind
but
this
is
a
queer
room
thus
far
no
thought
that
he
was
a
prisoner
had
entered
his
mind
he
arose
and
began
to
feel
his
way
around
by
the
walls
he
judged
that
he
was
in
a
room
not
more
than
ten
feet
square
he
could
form
no
idea
what
was
the
time
it
might
be
the
middle
of
the
night
so
far
as
he
knew
this
is
awkward
he
thought
i
do
fancy
being
shut
up
like
this
where
the
door
there
must
be
one
somewhere
he
found
it
at
last
and
tried
the
lock
but
it
did
not
yield
to
his
efforts
then
came
the
startling
thought
am
i
a
prisoner
he
stopped
short
and
thought
over
the
situation
he
recalled
all
he
could
of
the
men
in
whose
company
he
had
been
at
the
time
he
went
to
sleep
the
longer
he
thought
the
more
it
seemed
probable
that
it
was
as
he
suspected
though
a
little
startled
at
this
view
of
the
situation
jasper
was
by
no
means
disposed
to
be
despondent
his
courage
arose
with
the
difficulties
of
his
position
i
find
out
how
matters
stand
he
said
to
himself
i
pound
till
somebody
comes
he
began
to
pound
on
the
walls
of
the
room
with
such
effect
that
the
old
man
below
heard
him
the
bird
is
beating
against
the
walls
of
his
cage
he
thought
go
up
and
see
him
presently
jasper
heard
steps
ascending
the
stairs
almost
immediately
another
about
four
feet
from
the
floor
was
drawn
open
and
the
old
man
face
was
poked
in
did
you
knock
he
asked
grinning
yes
said
jasper
open
the
door
and
let
me
out
wo
you
have
some
supper
first
asked
nathan
with
a
leer
no
i
rather
go
out
said
jasper
in
a
tone
of
suspicion
i
could
allow
that
oh
no
said
nathan
what
right
have
you
to
keep
me
here
against
my
will
exclaimed
jasper
furiously
we
like
your
company
so
much
my
dear
young
man
said
nathan
nodding
his
head
waggishly
who
demanded
jasper
jack
and
bill
and
me
let
me
out
i
say
do
be
agitated
my
dear
boy
you
be
taken
good
care
of
i
rather
take
care
of
myself
will
you
open
the
door
i
could
but
i
bring
you
up
some
supper
directly
the
was
closed
suddenly
and
again
jasper
found
himself
in
the
dark
fully
understanding
now
that
he
was
a
prisoner
but
why
he
could
not
form
a
conjecture
chapter
xxvi
in
confinement
soon
the
old
man
reappeared
and
opened
the
he
carried
a
small
waiter
containing
a
cup
of
tea
a
plate
of
cold
meat
and
a
slice
of
white
bread
without
butter
we
do
want
you
to
starve
he
said
here
something
to
stay
your
stomach
you
hungry
ai
you
jasper
admitted
that
he
was
i
thought
so
when
i
was
your
age
i
was
always
eating
never
could
get
enough
jasper
wondered
if
this
were
the
case
why
the
old
man
had
not
grown
larger
but
he
did
not
say
this
he
took
the
waiter
from
nathan
and
set
it
on
his
lap
there
being
no
table
i
hope
you
do
mean
to
keep
me
long
as
a
boarder
he
said
you
wo
find
it
profitable
boarding
me
for
nothing
that
is
for
me
to
say
said
nathan
jack
and
bill
will
see
to
that
did
they
tell
you
to
confine
me
yes
i
told
you
that
already
will
you
ask
them
to
come
up
and
speak
to
me
i
want
to
know
why
i
am
here
they
ai
at
home
now
i
tell
them
when
they
come
in
thank
you
do
you
think
that
will
be
not
likely
they
come
in
so
late
you
be
abed
and
asleep
do
let
them
go
out
morning
without
seeing
me
i
tell
them
the
old
man
waited
till
jasper
had
finished
eating
and
then
took
the
waiter
back
through
the
window
wo
you
let
me
have
a
light
asked
jasper
i
do
want
to
stay
here
in
the
dark
you
set
the
house
on
fire
said
the
old
man
hesitating
and
get
burned
up
myself
i
should
be
fool
to
run
such
a
risk
as
that
this
consideration
suggested
itself
to
the
old
man
judgment
and
he
promised
to
bring
up
a
lamp
before
long
this
he
really
did
jasper
found
it
a
great
relief
he
was
now
broad
awake
the
effect
of
the
drug
having
passed
off
there
was
nothing
to
do
indeed
but
his
thoughts
were
busy
and
he
tried
hard
to
devise
some
method
of
escape
in
case
he
should
not
be
released
the
next
morning
breakfast
was
brought
to
him
about
eight
it
was
not
till
ten
that
the
was
opened
and
the
face
of
jack
appeared
at
the
opening
well
boy
how
do
you
like
your
quarters
he
asked
with
a
disagreeable
smile
not
at
all
answered
jasper
why
do
you
keep
me
here
we
had
reasons
for
putting
you
here
what
were
they
first
and
foremost
you
knew
too
much
were
you
afraid
i
should
betray
you
asked
jasper
you
might
i
promise
not
to
if
you
will
let
me
go
that
all
very
well
but
when
you
get
out
you
might
break
your
promise
then
it
would
be
for
the
first
time
said
jasper
proudly
i
never
break
my
promises
you
talk
well
boy
but
it
easy
to
talk
it
all
i
can
do
there
is
no
way
of
proving
what
i
say
that
so
and
that
the
reason
i
going
to
keep
you
at
that
rate
you
will
have
to
keep
me
all
my
life
no
there
another
way
what
is
it
asked
jasper
eagerly
join
us
and
when
you
in
the
same
box
you
wo
go
to
blabbing
what
do
you
mean
by
joining
you
asked
jasper
though
he
was
afraid
he
understood
only
too
well
you
ought
to
be
smart
enough
to
know
that
i
do
know
what
your
business
is
said
our
hero
you
do
said
jack
ironically
perhaps
you
think
we
commission
merchants
or
bankers
or
something
of
that
kind
bill
and
me
i
do
think
you
are
either
of
them
said
jasper
laughing
why
not
you
do
look
like
a
commission
merchant
or
a
banker
what
do
i
look
like
eh
boy
you
may
be
angry
if
i
answer
that
question
no
i
wo
go
ahead
you
look
as
if
you
did
get
your
living
in
any
way
so
honest
as
that
well
suppose
you
are
right
then
i
am
sorry
i
wish
you
would
reform
and
lead
a
different
life
no
preaching
i
did
bargain
for
that
then
all
i
have
to
say
is
you
are
in
no
danger
from
me
i
shall
not
betray
you
perhaps
you
are
to
be
trusted
but
i
ca
run
the
risk
you
must
join
us
you
may
be
wicked
yourself
you
have
no
right
to
make
me
so
said
jasper
firmly
that
all
nonsense
the
world
owes
me
a
living
and
you
too
not
without
work
i
going
to
work
for
my
living
i
mean
you
shall
you
shall
work
for
me
that
kind
of
work
will
do
the
world
no
good
i
want
to
do
something
useful
so
you
shall
you
shall
help
us
bleed
some
of
these
bloated
aristocrats
they
got
more
money
than
is
good
for
them
more
than
they
have
any
business
to
keep
i
do
agree
with
you
said
jasper
you
better
it
is
for
your
interest
said
jack
frowning
it
ca
be
for
my
interest
to
become
a
then
you
can
stay
here
till
you
rot
retorted
the
burglar
roughly
you
wo
come
out
of
this
chamber
till
you
have
agreed
to
become
one
of
us
there
was
something
in
this
threat
which
startled
jasper
bold
and
brave
as
he
was
such
an
outrage
wo
be
permitted
he
said
wo
it
sneered
jack
we
see
about
that
i
take
the
risk
you
do
know
me
yet
he
added
with
an
oath
is
it
wholly
because
you
are
afraid
i
will
betray
you
that
you
treat
me
in
this
way
asked
jasper
no
what
other
reason
have
you
i
tell
you
you
the
sort
of
boy
we
want
you
ai
any
whining
sort
of
boy
you
brave
and
spirited
you
would
be
worth
a
good
deal
to
us
burglar
though
jack
was
jasper
was
not
insensible
to
the
compliment
any
boy
likes
to
be
considered
spirited
even
if
he
does
not
deserve
it
and
he
felt
flattered
by
this
tribute
which
he
felt
that
he
deserved
at
least
in
part
i
am
glad
you
have
a
good
opinion
of
my
courage
he
said
but
i
think
i
can
find
a
better
use
for
it
than
in
the
career
you
open
to
me
if
i
accepted
your
proposal
from
fear
of
imprisonment
it
would
show
that
i
was
not
such
a
boy
as
you
describe
you
are
an
obstinate
fool
said
jack
with
a
frown
i
am
obstinate
in
this
said
jasper
composedly
you
want
to
spoil
my
life
by
making
me
a
criminal
do
you
mean
to
call
me
a
criminal
exclaimed
jack
angrily
i
call
you
nothing
i
only
take
you
at
your
word
you
talk
differently
from
this
a
week
from
now
said
jack
prepariug
to
shut
the
do
you
mean
to
keep
me
in
this
dark
hole
a
week
asked
jasper
unable
to
repress
a
shudder
ha
that
disturbs
you
does
it
asked
the
other
smiling
sardonically
yes
it
does
you
do
think
i
fancy
it
do
you
well
you
know
the
way
to
end
your
imprisonment
is
there
only
one
way
there
only
one
way
tell
the
old
man
nathan
when
you
made
up
your
mind
to
accept
my
offer
without
waiting
for
a
reply
jack
pushed
the
in
its
place
and
once
more
jasper
found
himself
in
the
dark
chapter
xxvii
an
unexpected
friend
three
days
and
nights
passed
and
jasper
was
still
in
confinement
three
times
a
day
nathan
came
to
bring
him
his
meals
each
time
he
asked
our
hero
are
you
ready
to
join
our
friends
and
each
time
jasper
answered
no
you
must
like
staying
here
said
the
old
man
i
am
very
tired
of
it
said
jasper
with
a
sigh
you
can
come
out
any
time
said
nathan
let
me
out
now
then
oh
no
my
dear
young
friend
said
nathan
shaking
his
head
not
until
you
accept
jack
offer
good
heavens
thought
jasper
can
it
be
possible
that
in
the
middle
of
a
great
city
i
can
be
imprisoned
like
this
with
hundreds
passing
the
house
every
hour
i
wish
i
could
be
heard
outside
but
this
was
impossible
owing
to
the
peculiar
situation
of
the
room
the
prospects
of
our
young
hero
were
certainly
gloomy
enough
but
there
an
old
saying
that
the
darkest
hour
is
just
before
the
dawn
and
deliverance
was
nearer
than
jasper
supposed
on
the
fourth
day
at
noon
jasper
heard
steps
ascending
the
stairs
he
supposed
it
to
be
the
old
man
with
his
dinner
and
he
looked
up
listlessly
as
the
was
opened
but
instead
of
the
wrinkled
face
of
nathan
he
beheld
the
fresh
face
of
a
young
girl
apparently
about
sixteen
years
of
age
she
regarded
the
prisoner
with
curiosity
and
surprise
here
your
dinner
she
said
thank
you
said
jasper
where
is
the
old
man
that
generally
comes
up
uncle
nathan
oh
he
gone
out
for
a
little
while
he
your
uncle
then
yes
do
you
live
here
i
only
just
come
he
sent
for
me
what
do
they
keep
you
here
for
she
asked
her
face
expressing
curiosity
are
you
sick
i
sick
of
being
cooped
up
here
then
why
do
you
stay
because
i
have
to
your
uncle
wo
let
me
out
why
not
has
he
told
you
no
he
only
told
me
to
bring
up
your
dinner
i
thought
it
was
a
man
i
did
know
it
was
a
boy
you
want
to
know
why
i
am
confined
here
yes
if
you
tell
me
it
is
because
your
uncle
is
afraid
i
inform
the
police
against
him
and
the
men
who
come
here
i
do
know
much
about
them
are
they
bad
people
then
i
am
afraid
they
are
they
do
things
that
make
them
liable
to
be
arrested
what
my
uncle
too
asked
the
girl
who
appeared
to
be
startled
i
am
not
sure
about
him
but
i
feel
sure
about
two
men
who
come
here
their
names
are
jack
and
bill
i
know
i
have
seen
them
both
one
is
a
young
man
the
other
must
be
near
fifty
he
stout
yes
how
long
do
you
think
they
will
keep
you
here
until
i
agree
to
join
them
in
breaking
the
laws
that
too
bad
said
the
girl
compassionately
is
it
awful
to
be
shut
up
there
yes
it
is
i
been
here
three
or
four
days
and
it
seems
as
many
weeks
do
you
think
you
could
help
me
to
escape
asked
jasper
in
a
lower
tone
the
girl
looked
frightened
i
would
dare
to
she
said
would
you
if
you
were
sure
your
uncle
would
find
out
yes
i
would
she
answered
heartily
do
you
think
you
could
manage
it
asked
jasper
eagerly
i
do
know
i
wish
i
could
she
answered
with
evident
sincerity
nancy
called
the
old
man
voice
from
below
sharply
has
that
boy
got
through
yet
coming
uncle
she
answered
i
speak
with
you
again
when
i
bring
up
your
supper
she
said
as
she
hurried
down
stairs
she
left
jasper
eager
and
excited
at
last
he
had
made
a
friend
in
the
camp
of
his
enemies
and
there
was
hope
ahead
chapter
xxviii
escape
jasper
waited
impatiently
for
not
that
he
was
hungry
for
excitement
had
taken
away
his
appetite
but
because
he
was
feverish
with
anxiety
as
to
his
prospects
of
release
suppose
the
old
man
should
suspect
her
and
come
up
with
the
supper
himself
he
thought
anxiously
but
his
anxiety
proved
groundless
a
little
after
five
the
door
was
opened
and
disclosed
the
young
girl
nancy
his
face
lighted
up
joyfully
i
glad
it
you
nancy
he
said
i
was
afraid
i
should
see
your
uncle
does
he
suspect
anything
no
he
scolded
me
for
allowing
you
so
long
to
eat
your
dinner
all
i
take
it
off
the
plate
and
eat
afterward
now
i
want
to
talk
a
little
have
you
found
out
any
way
to
help
me
i
do
know
do
you
think
you
could
get
out
of
this
window
jasper
looked
at
the
aperture
critically
yes
i
think
i
could
he
said
after
a
pause
with
some
one
on
the
other
side
to
pull
me
through
i
do
that
said
nancy
you
will
you
a
trump
what
am
i
to
do
afterward
can
you
help
me
to
leave
the
house
that
what
i
been
thinking
said
nancy
i
afraid
it
would
do
to
let
you
out
at
the
front
door
it
locked
and
bolted
and
the
bolt
squeaks
i
tried
it
to
see
the
windows
suggested
jasper
anxiously
no
i
am
afraid
not
then
if
i
ca
leave
the
house
it
no
use
to
get
out
of
this
room
yes
there
another
way
out
but
it
requires
courage
i
not
a
coward
said
jasper
no
you
do
look
like
it
said
nancy
who
was
more
favorably
disposed
toward
jasper
on
account
of
his
good
looks
thank
you
said
jasper
gratified
now
tell
me
what
is
your
plan
there
a
scuttle
through
which
you
can
get
out
on
the
roof
would
you
dare
to
do
it
yes
i
might
get
on
to
some
other
roof
yes
but
you
might
slip
off
i
am
not
afraid
you
think
of
that
because
you
are
a
girl
yes
i
would
rather
stay
here
than
trust
myself
on
the
roof
do
you
know
if
the
next
house
is
higher
than
this
yes
it
is
that
very
awkward
said
jasper
thoughtfully
but
there
are
some
windows
in
the
side
of
the
house
you
might
get
in
at
one
of
them
and
be
taken
for
a
well
i
must
run
the
risk
any
way
when
do
you
think
i
had
better
try
it
there
be
nobody
in
the
house
but
uncle
and
me
that
good
said
jasper
reflecting
that
nathan
looked
feeble
and
being
small
in
size
would
not
be
more
than
a
match
for
his
strength
if
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
when
does
your
uncle
go
to
bed
he
asked
at
eleven
when
will
you
come
for
me
at
twelve
or
a
little
after
are
the
nights
dark
now
asked
jasper
it
would
be
rather
ticklish
being
on
the
roof
if
it
were
pitch
dark
no
the
moon
will
be
up
then
that
all
right
if
you
find
out
anything
else
that
will
help
let
me
know
yes
i
will
nancy
yes
uncle
answered
the
girl
at
twelve
she
said
in
a
low
voice
and
hurried
down
stairs
jasper
in
thinking
over
the
plan
he
had
in
view
realized
that
it
was
one
that
would
probably
require
all
his
courage
and
nerve
it
would
be
a
great
relief
to
get
through
without
accident
but
he
never
thought
of
backing
out
he
felt
that
anything
was
better
than
to
be
confined
longer
in
his
present
prison
it
seemed
a
long
time
to
wait
especially
in
the
darkness
for
the
oil
was
burned
out
in
his
lamp
and
there
was
no
chance
of
asking
for
a
further
supply
he
had
forgotten
it
when
nancy
came
up
with
his
supper
however
he
felt
that
it
was
of
no
particular
consequence
as
he
was
so
soon
to
be
released
so
the
hours
passed
he
did
not
permit
himself
to
fall
asleep
lest
he
should
not
be
awake
when
nancy
came
at
last
he
heard
a
faint
noise
at
the
door
and
saw
nancy
standing
outside
with
a
candle
are
you
ready
she
whispered
yes
ready
and
waiting
now
try
to
get
through
and
i
will
help
you
she
set
down
the
candle
and
jasper
set
about
his
task
it
was
a
tight
squeeze
but
at
last
he
got
out
and
stood
on
his
feet
in
the
entry
now
follow
me
said
nancy
in
a
whisper
he
climbed
a
narrow
steep
staircase
and
then
a
ladder
and
unfastening
the
scuttle
he
laid
it
back
the
moon
shone
softly
down
bathing
the
city
in
its
beautiful
light
he
got
out
lightly
on
the
roof
he
said
and
thank
you
nancy
good
luck
said
nancy
he
lowered
the
scuttle
and
sat
astride
the
roof
considering
what
to
do
next
chapter
xxix
jasper
in
a
new
character
it
was
a
relief
to
be
out
of
his
prison
but
it
must
be
admitted
that
jasper
situation
was
not
particularly
desirable
or
agreeable
it
was
midnight
and
he
was
seated
astride
the
roof
of
the
house
which
had
served
as
his
prison
there
seemed
to
be
no
chance
to
reach
the
street
except
to
slide
down
the
roof
and
that
would
be
certain
death
jasper
looked
about
him
in
great
perplexity
as
his
deliverer
had
told
him
the
next
house
was
a
story
higher
than
the
one
on
whose
roof
he
was
seated
and
still
more
important
there
was
a
looking
out
in
that
direction
when
jasper
saw
this
hope
sprang
up
in
his
heart
if
that
window
is
not
fastened
i
can
get
in
he
thought
he
edged
his
way
along
to
the
window
and
found
that
to
reach
it
he
would
have
to
slide
down
a
little
way
and
catch
hold
of
the
blind
to
prevent
sliding
too
far
there
some
risk
about
it
thought
jasper
shall
i
try
it
i
do
know
whether
jasper
was
justified
in
taking
the
risk
he
did
for
there
was
great
danger
of
sliding
over
into
the
street
i
do
think
i
should
have
ventured
to
do
it
but
our
hero
was
fearless
and
courageous
and
he
resolved
that
as
this
was
the
only
method
of
escape
he
would
avail
himself
of
it
as
a
precaution
against
slipping
however
he
took
off
his
shoes
and
catching
the
strings
in
his
teeth
commenced
the
perilous
descent
he
succeeded
in
grasping
the
blind
and
staying
his
progress
now
if
the
window
should
be
fastened
what
should
i
do
he
thought
but
it
was
not
he
succeeded
in
raising
it
and
with
a
feeling
of
intense
relief
made
his
way
into
the
chamber
then
for
the
first
time
there
flashed
upon
him
the
thought
that
he
had
placed
himself
in
a
very
suspicious
predicament
he
had
entered
a
house
at
midnight
through
the
window
why
might
he
not
be
taken
for
a
burglar
this
was
the
way
a
burglar
was
likely
to
enter
and
if
he
should
be
caught
here
his
explanation
would
be
considered
very
unsatisfactory
jasper
brave
as
he
was
was
startled
by
this
thought
while
simultaneously
the
difficulty
of
escape
was
forced
upon
him
he
looked
about
him
in
mental
disturbance
it
was
a
small
attic
chamber
there
was
a
bed
in
the
room
a
a
couple
of
chairs
and
a
this
being
open
revealed
a
few
clothes
belonging
apparently
to
a
man
why
is
he
here
thought
jasper
and
what
shall
i
do
if
he
comes
though
his
story
was
true
he
nevertheless
felt
that
it
was
improbable
and
before
he
could
tell
it
he
thought
it
likely
that
an
alarm
would
be
given
resulting
in
his
being
consigned
to
the
care
of
the
police
an
idea
came
to
him
he
opened
the
bed
drew
out
one
of
the
sheets
and
arrayed
himself
in
it
after
carefully
folding
back
the
quilt
now
he
said
to
himself
if
it
is
necessary
i
will
see
what
sort
of
a
ghost
i
can
make
hardly
had
he
done
this
than
he
heard
steps
ascending
the
stairs
jasper
had
little
doubt
that
it
was
the
occupant
of
the
chamber
which
he
had
so
unceremoniously
entered
i
get
into
the
wardrobe
if
i
can
he
thought
he
managed
to
squeeze
himself
into
the
wardrobe
and
waited
with
anxiety
for
the
arrival
of
the
through
a
crevice
he
saw
the
entrance
of
a
stout
young
man
whistling
a
popular
song
he
was
probably
a
clerk
or
young
mechanic
who
after
a
hard
day
work
had
been
to
some
cheap
place
of
amusement
wholly
unconscious
of
jasper
presence
the
young
man
undressed
himself
still
continuing
to
whistle
and
got
into
bed
it
was
so
light
outside
that
he
had
not
lighted
the
gas
i
wonder
how
long
it
take
for
him
to
get
to
sleep
thought
jasper
i
getting
tired
of
being
cooped
up
here
unfortunately
for
him
the
young
man
seemed
to
be
in
no
hurry
he
whistled
to
himself
and
occasionally
sung
in
a
low
tone
at
length
jasper
decided
to
make
a
desperate
move
observing
that
the
young
man
was
lying
with
his
face
turned
from
the
wardrobe
he
seized
his
opportunity
stepped
softly
out
and
gained
the
middle
of
the
floor
before
he
was
seen
the
effect
upon
the
young
man
was
startling
the
whistle
died
away
and
with
blanched
cheeks
and
staring
eyes
he
sat
bolt
upright
in
bed
oh
lord
he
exclaimed
tremulously
what
are
you
not
a
word
escaped
from
the
white
figure
but
it
solemnly
waved
its
hand
are
you
a
ghost
asked
the
young
man
jasper
made
a
guttural
noise
and
waved
his
arm
again
oh
lord
preserve
me
ejaculated
the
young
man
shaking
with
terror
go
away
do
good
ghost
i
have
done
anything
as
he
spoke
he
covered
up
his
head
with
the
bedclothes
and
jasper
could
see
by
the
convulsive
movements
that
he
was
in
a
state
of
the
greatest
agitation
our
hero
felt
inclined
to
laugh
but
forebore
he
considered
whether
it
would
be
safe
disguised
as
he
was
to
make
his
way
down
stairs
and
out
at
the
front
door
but
another
course
suddenly
suggested
itself
the
young
man
looked
why
should
he
reveal
himself
to
him
and
throw
himself
upon
him
for
protection
besides
he
was
sorry
to
frighten
him
so
much
acting
upon
his
new
resolution
he
threw
off
the
sheet
and
said
in
his
natural
voice
do
be
frightened
i
am
not
a
ghost
the
young
man
in
bed
took
courage
to
uncover
his
head
ai
you
a
spirit
he
said
doubtfully
no
more
than
you
said
jasper
laughing
what
made
you
frighten
me
so
who
are
you
i
am
a
friend
of
yours
i
do
think
i
ever
saw
you
before
how
did
you
get
in
through
the
window
you
ai
a
burglar
are
you
asked
the
young
man
with
fresh
apprehension
of
course
not
said
jasper
laughing
do
i
look
like
a
burglar
no
but
i
do
see
what
made
you
come
in
the
fact
is
i
want
you
to
help
me
said
jasper
just
light
the
gas
and
i
tell
you
all
about
it
he
spoke
so
frankly
and
straightforwardly
that
the
young
man
was
reassured
he
got
out
of
bed
and
lighted
the
gas
there
do
i
look
like
a
burglar
asked
jasper
no
you
do
but
i
do
see
how
you
got
in
then
i
tell
you
i
just
escaped
from
the
next
house
escaped
yes
i
was
locked
up
in
a
dark
room
for
four
days
and
the
only
way
i
could
get
out
was
through
the
roof
of
course
i
could
slide
off
into
the
street
and
break
my
neck
so
i
got
in
here
through
the
window
you
do
say
ejaculated
the
young
man
what
did
they
shut
you
up
for
was
it
your
father
no
it
a
long
story
i
knew
something
they
were
afraid
i
would
tell
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
am
going
to
ask
you
to
let
me
out
into
the
street
what
so
late
as
this
you
would
have
to
stay
out
all
night
that
would
be
better
than
to
be
locked
up
as
i
have
been
for
the
last
four
days
suppose
you
wait
till
morning
this
bed
is
big
enough
for
both
of
us
thank
you
i
should
like
that
and
shall
be
much
obliged
to
you
you
are
sure
you
are
not
a
burglar
said
the
young
man
with
a
brief
return
of
his
former
suspicion
neither
burglar
nor
ghost
said
jasper
what
made
you
put
on
the
sheet
i
was
afraid
you
would
take
me
for
a
burglar
so
i
meant
to
frighten
you
and
escape
concluding
that
you
would
be
afraid
to
pursue
me
that
so
i
really
thought
you
were
a
spirit
if
you
think
so
now
just
feel
my
muscle
said
jasper
smiling
i
do
think
so
now
if
i
am
to
sleep
with
you
here
is
your
sheet
we
can
make
better
use
of
it
than
in
masquerading
as
ghosts
jasper
undressed
himself
and
got
into
bed
he
learned
that
his
companion
name
was
adam
diedrich
and
that
he
kept
a
small
cigar
store

jasper
gets
a
place
jasper
took
breakfast
the
next
morning
with
the
friendly
young
german
whose
acquaintance
he
had
so
singularly
made
not
a
word
was
said
as
to
the
manner
in
which
he
had
entered
the
house
he
was
introduced
by
adam
as
my
friend
mr
kent
after
breakfast
jasper
went
around
with
his
new
friend
to
the
place
of
business
of
the
latter
he
decided
not
to
call
upon
fitch
till
about
ten
while
on
his
way
to
the
merchant
he
met
the
girl
nancy
with
a
tin
pail
in
her
hand
the
girl
face
lighted
up
when
she
saw
him
so
you
got
off
the
roof
she
said
i
was
so
afraid
you
would
fall
thank
you
nancy
said
jasper
thanks
to
you
i
am
out
of
prison
but
how
did
you
get
off
the
roof
jasper
gave
her
an
account
of
his
midnight
adventures
and
now
tell
me
he
said
how
does
your
uncle
take
my
flight
he
awful
mad
about
it
said
the
girl
shaking
her
head
what
does
he
think
does
he
suspect
you
asked
jasper
eagerly
he
did
at
first
but
he
does
now
he
puzzled
to
know
how
you
got
away
and
jack
he
mad
too
jack
does
he
know
it
yes
he
came
around
to
the
house
about
eight
he
was
looking
seedy
as
if
he
been
up
all
night
as
near
as
i
can
find
out
he
failed
in
some
job
last
night
and
that
made
him
cross
very
likely
you
carried
up
that
boy
breakfast
i
heard
him
say
said
my
uncle
give
it
to
me
and
i
take
it
up
i
want
to
talk
to
him
so
uncle
nathan
made
me
get
the
breakfast
ready
i
gave
it
to
him
and
he
went
up
a
minute
after
he
roared
down
stairs
the
boy
what
have
you
done
with
him
uncle
nathan
stared
and
called
out
your
eyes
jack
ca
you
see
straight
this
morning
jack
answered
as
mad
as
could
be
up
here
you
old
fool
and
see
if
your
eyes
are
any
better
than
mine
uncle
went
up
the
stairs
two
at
a
time
and
looked
in
the
chamber
too
what
do
you
say
to
that
i
heard
jack
say
dumfounded
said
uncle
nathan
and
then
he
called
me
were
you
frightened
asked
jasper
a
little
said
the
girl
i
was
afraid
i
look
guilty
you
know
anything
about
this
asked
my
uncle
sternly
gracious
you
do
mean
to
say
he
gone
i
said
looking
as
much
surprised
as
possible
did
he
get
out
what
i
want
to
know
said
jack
and
he
looked
suspiciously
at
uncle
nathan
and
me
as
innocent
as
a
babe
said
uncle
nathan
must
have
let
him
out
said
jack
guess
he
squeezed
through
the
opening
said
i
he
did
said
uncle
nathan
he
did
you
see
him
or
hear
him
he
could
get
out
might
have
got
out
through
the
door
in
the
night
said
uncle
nathan
you
find
the
door
unlocked
asked
jack
was
up
first
how
was
it
nancy
asked
my
uncle
it
was
all
right
said
i
that
puzzled
them
both
then
they
thought
of
the
roof
and
went
up
i
was
afraid
they
would
find
you
there
but
they
did
they
seemed
to
think
you
could
get
away
so
and
they
dreadfully
puzzled
to
know
how
you
did
escape
i
was
afraid
you
fallen
off
so
i
went
outside
to
see
if
i
could
find
any
blood
on
the
sidewalk
but
i
could
and
i
hoped
you
got
into
the
next
house
your
uncle
did
think
of
that
did
he
no
nor
jack
either
well
i
been
lucky
i
only
hope
they
wo
suspect
you
they
will
if
they
should
see
me
talking
to
you
in
the
street
then
we
better
separate
nancy
i
wo
forget
the
service
you
done
me
jasper
i
so
glad
you
got
away
i
wish
you
were
away
too
nancy
it
not
a
good
place
for
you
i
do
think
i
shall
stay
long
said
the
girl
i
did
know
uncle
kept
such
company
or
i
would
have
come
to
his
house
some
day
i
shall
leave
him
and
then
i
shall
go
out
to
service
that
would
be
better
for
you
i
advise
you
to
do
it
soon
the
two
parted
company
and
jasper
proceeded
at
once
to
office
i
wonder
what
he
think
of
me
jasper
said
to
himself
i
promised
to
come
back
after
carrying
the
money
and
now
it
is
four
days
late
is
fitch
in
the
asked
our
hero
of
the
clerk
yes
but
he
busy
i
will
wait
then
ca
i
attend
to
your
business
i
think
not
your
business
must
be
very
important
said
the
clerk
with
a
sneer
i
do
know
about
that
said
jasper
composedly
but
i
think
if
you
will
tell
fitch
that
jasper
kent
is
here
he
will
receive
me
is
your
name
of
such
weight
asked
the
clerk
with
another
sneer
suppose
you
put
it
to
the
test
said
jasper
smiling
the
clerk
had
not
seen
jasper
when
he
called
before
and
did
recognize
him
as
the
restorer
of
little
harry
otherwise
he
would
have
treated
our
hero
with
more
attention
influenced
by
curiosity
he
went
into
the
and
announced
jasper
name
bring
him
in
said
the
merchant
jasper
entered
but
the
manner
of
fitch
differed
greatly
from
what
it
had
been
when
they
parted
four
days
before
then
it
was
cordial
and
friendly
now
it
was
cold
and
suspicious
fitch
said
jasper
responded
the
merchant
coldly
you
have
been
a
long
time
returning
from
your
errand
that
true
sir
but
i
would
have
come
sooner
if
i
could
fitch
looked
up
in
surprise
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
could
come
demanded
he
yes
sir
what
prevented
you
i
was
in
close
confinement
what
were
you
arrested
and
again
the
merchant
face
was
overspread
by
doubt
and
suspicion
no
sir
i
hope
i
shall
never
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
police
how
then
could
you
be
in
confinement
this
is
a
riddle
the
house
to
which
i
was
requested
to
bring
the
money
was
a
haunt
of
desperate
men
burglars
i
found
out
and
they
were
afraid
i
would
betray
their
rendezvous
they
mixed
me
some
lemonade
which
i
now
think
must
have
been
drugged
for
i
went
to
sleep
in
the
middle
of
the
day
soon
after
drinking
it
when
i
awoke
up
i
found
myself
in
a
dark
room
in
the
centre
of
the
house
is
this
true
asked
the
merchant
amazed
can
such
things
take
place
within
earshot
of
the
police
yes
sir
there
was
no
chance
of
my
making
myself
heard
if
there
had
been
i
would
have
called
for
help
how
did
you
get
out
and
when
last
night
at
midnight
how
i
will
tell
you
sir
that
i
think
is
the
most
interesting
part
of
it
proceed
when
fitch
had
heard
jasper
explanation
he
no
longer
doubted
him
his
friendly
cordial
manner
returned
and
he
congratulated
our
hero
on
his
prompt
rejection
of
jack
offers
though
that
rejection
exposed
him
to
continued
imprisonment
now
he
asked
what
are
your
plans
to
get
something
to
do
said
jasper
of
what
kind
any
kind
i
will
engage
you
for
the
present
at
ten
dollars
a
week
will
that
suit
you
yes
sir
nothing
could
suit
me
better
do
you
think
you
can
live
on
that
easily
then
that
is
settled
you
will
go
home
with
me
will
be
soon
enough
to
look
for
a
here
are
your
first
wages
in
advance
thank
you
sir
you
are
very
kind
i
have
not
forgotten
that
i
am
indebted
to
you
for
the
recovery
of
my
little
harry
here
leonard
the
clerk
already
mentioned
entered
the
he
looked
inquiringly
from
jasper
to
fitch
leonard
said
the
latter
this
young
man
is
to
be
your
he
takes
the
place
of
victor
who
left
last
week
instruct
him
in
his
duties
yes
sir
said
the
clerk
in
no
little
surprise
jasper
followed
him
out
into
the
warehouse
chapter
xxxi
the
unwelcome
relative
now
that
jasper
has
found
a
place
we
can
venture
to
leave
him
for
a
time
and
go
back
to
the
home
which
he
had
felt
compelled
to
leave
his
felt
relieved
by
his
departure
it
left
her
mistress
of
the
situation
with
no
one
to
interfere
with
or
question
her
authority
how
jasper
fared
she
cared
little
or
not
at
all
how
he
was
likely
to
get
along
without
money
she
never
inquired
nor
did
she
feel
a
twinge
of
remorse
for
her
treatment
of
one
who
had
been
her
late
husband
sole
care
and
hope
it
was
enough
for
her
that
she
had
nicholas
with
her
stern
as
she
generally
was
toward
him
she
was
weakly
indulgent
whatever
he
wanted
she
gave
him
if
it
were
not
utterly
unreasonable
she
was
afraid
he
would
tire
of
the
country
and
want
to
go
away
and
this
led
her
to
gratify
him
in
his
wishes
in
order
that
she
might
retain
him
at
her
side
nicholas
was
not
slow
in
finding
out
his
power
and
in
using
it
he
asked
and
obtained
a
horse
for
his
own
use
and
later
an
elegant
little
carriage
was
ordered
from
the
city
in
which
he
used
to
drive
around
the
neighborhood
with
the
airs
of
a
young
prince
to
others
he
might
seem
arrogant
and
conceited
to
his
mother
he
was
only
possessed
of
the
proper
spirit
of
a
gentleman
in
her
eyes
he
was
handsome
though
in
the
eyes
of
no
one
else
but
perfect
happiness
is
in
her
new
prosperity
kent
forgot
that
she
had
a
brother
who
was
not
likely
to
reflect
credit
upon
the
family
she
had
not
heard
from
him
for
years
and
supposed
he
did
not
know
where
she
was
but
in
this
as
we
know
she
was
mistaken
one
day
nicholas
was
standing
on
the
lawn
in
front
of
the
house
waiting
for
his
carriage
to
be
brought
around
from
the
stable
when
his
attention
was
drawn
to
a
man
who
was
standing
by
the
fence
and
looking
at
him
in
what
he
considered
an
impudently
familiar
way
since
nicholas
had
become
a
young
aristocrat
he
was
easily
made
angry
by
such
familiarity
on
the
part
of
anyone
of
the
lower
orders
and
he
resented
it
at
once
why
are
you
standing
there
fellow
he
demanded
frowning
the
man
neither
seemed
overawed
nor
angry
he
only
looked
amused
because
i
am
tired
of
walking
he
said
then
go
somewhere
else
thank
you
this
suits
me
very
well
said
the
man
smiling
provokingly
it
does
suit
me
though
said
nicholas
bristling
up
who
are
you
inquired
dick
for
it
was
he
with
provoking
nonchalance
who
am
i
i
let
you
know
retorted
nicholas
now
very
angry
i
wish
you
would
that
what
i
just
asked
you
i
the
owner
of
this
place
and
i
warn
you
off
oh
you
the
owner
of
this
place
said
the
stranger
laughing
do
you
own
the
road
too
yes
said
nicholas
i
own
the
road
in
front
of
my
place
dick
laughed
again
you
a
young
man
ai
you
to
be
a
landed
proprietor
how
about
your
mother
does
she
own
anything
what
do
you
know
about
my
mother
demanded
nicholas
a
little
nonplussed
more
than
you
think
for
young
man
said
dick
she
used
to
go
to
school
with
me
did
she
well
i
suppose
she
could
help
it
if
there
were
low
persons
in
the
school
with
her
that
good
said
the
stranger
laughing
heartily
so
i
am
a
low
person
am
i
you
look
like
it
said
nicholas
insolently
he
expected
the
man
would
be
angry
but
instead
he
laughed
more
heartily
than
before
nicholas
began
to
think
he
was
crazy
well
boy
he
said
after
a
pause
just
remember
that
appearances
are
sometimes
deceitful
i
do
think
they
are
so
in
this
case
said
nicholas
but
i
waste
anymore
time
with
you
there
my
horse
coming
around
i
going
to
ride
is
that
your
team
it
very
neat
my
word
that
nothing
to
you
wo
you
give
me
a
seat
i
never
been
in
this
town
before
and
i
should
like
to
take
a
drive
look
here
fellow
you
got
cheek
exclaimed
nicholas
have
i
do
you
think
i
would
be
seen
in
such
low
company
why
not
i
a
gentleman
if
you
are
a
gentleman
then
i
am
too
what
do
you
mean
what
have
i
to
do
with
you
a
good
deal
said
the
stranger
i
am
your
uncle
nicholas
gasped
for
breath
what
this
low
common
person
his
uncle
he
would
not
credit
it
that
a
lie
he
said
you
are
trying
to
humbug
me
not
so
fast
nephew
nicholas
said
dick
you
ca
alter
facts
your
mother
brother
did
she
ever
tell
you
of
your
uncle
dick
uncle
dick
nicholas
did
remember
that
his
mother
had
named
such
a
person
and
the
uncomfortable
apprehension
dawned
upon
him
that
the
stranger
claim
was
well
founded
after
all
he
kept
silent
but
flared
at
the
stranger
in
a
state
of
mental
disturbance
i
see
you
heard
of
me
said
dick
with
a
short
laugh
is
your
mother
at
home
i
believe
so
said
nicholas
sullenly
i
come
a
long
way
to
see
her
will
you
go
in
and
tell
her
i
am
here
nicholas
was
not
overwilling
to
obey
the
person
whom
he
had
just
called
low
but
he
felt
considerable
curiosity
as
to
whether
the
man
was
really
his
uncle
and
this
decided
him
to
comply
with
his
request
i
will
speak
to
my
mother
he
said
she
will
know
whether
you
are
what
you
claim
to
be
yes
she
will
know
i
do
believe
she
has
forgotten
brother
dick
nicholas
sought
and
found
his
mother
what
nicholas
back
so
soon
she
said
looking
up
from
her
sewing
no
mother
i
have
started
yet
there
a
person
down
stairs
who
says
he
is
my
uncle
dick
and
he
wants
to
see
you
good
heavens
is
he
here
exclaimed
kent
in
a
tone
of
vexation
how
in
the
world
did
he
find
me
out
then
it
is
he
he
is
a
very
person
he
kept
low
associates
where
is
he
down
on
the
lawn
tell
him
to
come
in
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
see
him
it
may
not
be
your
brother
after
all
said
nicholas
i
am
afraid
it
is
i
can
tell
soon
as
i
see
him
nicholas
went
down
stairs
in
no
very
pleasant
mood
you
to
come
in
he
said
ungraciously
my
mother
will
see
you
i
thought
so
said
dick
smiling
complacently
chapter

a
cold
reception
richard
varley
followed
nicholas
into
the
presence
of
kent
the
latter
looked
scrutinizingly
at
him
as
he
approached
hoping
that
it
might
be
an
impostor
but
no
there
was
no
mistaking
his
appearance
it
was
indeed
her
brother
how
d
do
helen
said
dick
with
ostentatious
cordiality
very
well
richard
she
answered
coldly
slipping
her
hand
out
of
his
grasp
as
quickly
as
she
could
the
old
girl
ai
very
glad
to
see
me
thought
dick
just
as
i
thought
how
did
you
find
me
out
asked
kent
there
was
a
man
from
this
way
told
me
of
your
good
luck
where
were
you
then
in
missouri
near
st
louis
indeed
have
you
just
come
from
there
yes
did
you
have
any
business
this
way
i
suppose
you
must
or
you
have
come
so
far
i
came
on
purpose
to
see
you
helen
said
dick
trying
to
look
like
an
affectionate
brother
and
signally
failing
you
are
certainly
very
kind
said
kent
in
a
cold
tone
evincing
not
the
slightest
pleasure
at
his
devotion
i
am
afraid
you
must
have
put
yourself
to
a
good
deal
of
inconvenience
on
my
account
why
yes
i
have
answered
her
brother
perceiving
at
once
that
he
might
urge
this
as
a
claim
upon
her
but
what
of
that
ai
you
my
only
sister
and
has
it
been
years
since
we
met
really
richard
said
kent
with
a
little
quiet
sarcasm
i
was
hardly
prepared
to
expect
from
you
so
great
an
interest
in
me
i
wonder
you
did
come
before
it
a
good
many
years
since
we
met
well
helen
you
see
i
could
afford
it
before
i
wanted
to
see
you
but
i
could
raise
the
money
to
come
east
you
raised
it
now
it
seems
yes
i
had
a
little
stroke
of
luck
you
doing
well
then
asked
his
sister
with
a
slight
show
of
interest
if
this
were
so
she
was
ready
to
welcome
him
i
said
a
little
show
of
luck
i
got
together
money
enough
to
come
east
oh
indeed
returned
kent
her
manner
becoming
chilly
again
dick
got
nettled
he
did
relish
his
reception
it
seems
to
me
you
ai
very
glad
to
see
me
said
he
bluntly
i
never
was
very
demonstrative
said
his
sister
did
you
expect
me
to
fall
on
your
neck
and
embrace
you
no
but
well
you
know
what
i
mean
you
are
as
cold
as
an
icicle
it
my
way
i
suppose
is
your
wife
living
yes
is
she
with
you
asked
kent
rather
apprehensively
no
it
was
too
expensive
for
me
to
bring
two
i
hear
you
are
rich
helen
is
that
what
brought
you
on
do
be
so
suspicious
it
only
natural
i
should
congratulate
you
before
this
nicholas
had
left
the
room
to
go
out
on
his
proposed
drive
i
got
enough
to
live
on
economically
she
answered
with
reserve
i
am
not
rich
your
son
nicholas
acts
as
if
you
were
how
is
that
dick
laughed
he
puts
on
as
many
heirs
as
a
prince
he
has
considerable
spirit
said
kent
proudly
there
no
doubt
of
that
he
ordered
me
off
with
the
air
of
a
young
lord
that
was
before
he
knew
who
you
were
yes
he
did
know
i
was
his
uncle
by
the
way
you
got
a
have
you
yes
of
this
property
belongs
to
him
where
is
he
he
is
absent
just
now
answered
kent
in
a
tone
of
reserve
dick
laughed
oh
you
good
at
keeping
secrets
helen
he
said
but
you
deceive
me
what
do
you
mean
inquired
his
sister
with
some
indignation
i
know
all
about
his
going
away
helen
who
told
you
the
neighbors
have
you
been
questioning
them
about
my
affairs
no
no
you
on
the
wrong
scent
this
time
he
told
me
himself
what
has
he
got
back
again
demanded
kent
in
surprise
and
dismay
no
i
met
him
in
missouri
he
told
me
there
how
did
he
know
you
were
related
to
me
he
heard
me
and
my
wife
talking
about
you
and
then
he
told
me
what
did
he
tell
you
that
you
and
he
could
agree
and
so
he
left
home
he
was
insubordinate
he
disobeyed
me
and
i
would
stand
it
oh
well
you
two
can
settle
your
own
affairs
i
do
care
to
interfere
only
i
thought
you
would
like
to
hear
from
him
what
he
doing
asked
kent
he
was
in
louis
when
i
left
looking
out
for
a
situation
i
wash
my
hands
of
him
he
might
live
easily
enough
if
he
would
submit
to
me
if
not
he
will
probably
have
to
submit
to
a
great
many
privations
he
is
a
pretty
smart
boy
he
get
along
i
consider
my
nicholas
smarter
said
kent
coldly
perhaps
so
answered
her
brother
dubiously
i
do
know
much
about
nicholas
where
are
you
staying
asked
his
sister
why
said
dick
rather
taken
aback
i
calculated
you
would
invite
me
to
stay
here
awhile
seeing
i
come
so
far
to
see
you
kent
bit
her
lips
in
vexation
you
can
stay
a
day
or
two
if
you
like
she
said
but
we
live
very
quietly
nicholas
and
i
do
think
it
will
suit
one
so
active
as
you
are
i
take
the
risk
sister
helen
it
seems
good
to
be
in
my
own
sister
house
after
so
many
years
besides
i
should
like
to
ride
out
with
my
nephew
behind
that
gay
horse
of
his
you
can
speak
to
him
about
it
said
kent
i
believe
he
prefers
to
be
alone
oh
he
be
willing
to
treat
his
uncle
to
a
ride
i
give
him
a
few
hints
about
driving
kent
winced
she
was
proud
and
she
did
not
fancy
exhibiting
dick
to
the
village
people
as
her
brother
but
there
seemed
no
way
of
avoiding
it
she
privately
determined
to
get
rid
of
him
as
soon
as
possible
i
must
leave
you
now
she
said
gathering
up
her
work
i
will
ask
the
servant
to
show
you
your
room
all
right
helen
do
trouble
yourself
about
me
i
make
myself
at
home
i
afraid
you
will
thought
his
sister
chapter
xxxiii
dick
punishes
nicholas
is
that
man
going
to
stay
here
asked
nicholas
in
a
tone
of
dissatisfaction
yes
what
made
you
invite
him
i
could
help
it
nicholas
he
is
my
brother
i
ashamed
of
the
relationship
i
am
not
proud
of
it
myself
but
i
ca
help
paying
him
a
little
attention
how
long
is
he
going
to
stay
a
day
or
two
he
stay
a
week
or
two
if
you
let
him
i
can
prevent
that
how
you
see
the
manner
of
nicholas
toward
his
uncle
was
far
from
agreeable
in
fact
it
was
almost
insolent
dick
retained
his
temper
out
of
policy
but
he
said
to
himself
some
time
or
other
my
fine
nephew
i
pay
off
old
scores
see
if
i
do
are
you
going
to
ride
this
morning
he
asked
the
next
day
i
may
answered
nicholas
i
should
like
to
ride
with
you
i
prefer
riding
by
myself
oh
come
nephew
i
sha
stay
here
long
do
refuse
such
a
small
favor
in
consequence
probably
of
the
first
part
of
this
answer
kent
said
nicholas
you
better
take
your
uncle
out
this
morning
and
show
him
a
little
of
the
village
nicholas
grumblingly
assented
so
about
ten
they
started
out
you
got
a
good
horse
here
said
dick
he
ought
to
be
mother
paid
four
hundred
dollars
for
him
did
she
though
you
ought
to
have
got
me
to
send
you
one
from
the
west
for
half
the
money
i
have
sent
you
a
better
one
i
do
believe
it
because
you
do
know
i
do
it
takes
a
good
driver
to
drive
this
horse
said
nicholas
does
it
i
could
drive
this
horse
blindfolded
he
spoke
contemptuously
and
nicholas
was
nettled
he
prided
himself
upon
his
driving
ability
and
now
his
uncle
underestimated
it
the
horse
is
not
as
easy
to
drive
as
you
think
he
said
if
you
believe
it
take
the
reins
and
see
all
right
this
was
what
dick
wanted
for
he
had
a
plan
for
revenging
himself
on
his
upstart
nephew
he
drove
on
till
he
got
to
a
place
where
there
was
a
muddy
and
miry
puddle
beside
the
road
then
by
a
dexterous
manoeuver
for
he
understood
driving
thoroughly
he
managed
to
overturn
the
wagon
and
nicholas
was
thrown
headlong
into
the
puddle
dick
leaped
out
just
at
the
right
time
retaining
his
hold
on
the
reins
bespattered
with
mud
and
drenched
with
mire
nicholas
arose
from
the
puddle
a
sorry
figure
what
did
you
do
that
for
he
demanded
wrathfully
surveying
himself
with
disgust
i
afraid
i
ca
manage
your
horse
said
dick
with
hypocritical
meekness
he
was
too
much
for
me
did
i
tell
you
so
said
nicholas
triumphing
in
spite
of
his
woful
condition
i
sorry
you
fell
into
the
puddle
why
did
you
jump
as
i
did
i
did
have
time
said
nicholas
ruefully
what
a
figure
i
am
i
suppose
we
may
as
well
go
home
yes
said
nicholas
sullenly
that
comes
of
giving
you
the
reins
you
are
right
said
dick
you
better
drive
home
yourself
nicholas
took
the
reins
but
it
mortified
him
not
a
little
to
see
the
looks
of
wonder
and
amusement
which
he
attracted
as
he
passed
through
the
village
dick
laughed
to
himself
i
rather
think
my
proud
nephew
we
about
even
he
said
to
himself
in
the
course
of
the
next
day
dick
ventured
to
suggest
to
his
sister
that
a
temporary
loan
would
be
very
acceptable
a
loan
she
repeated
curling
her
lip
why
not
say
at
once
i
willing
to
put
it
on
that
ground
said
dick
unabashed
still
i
give
you
my
note
for
the
amount
if
you
say
so
what
good
would
that
do
why
i
got
some
plans
in
view
which
if
successful
will
enable
me
to
repay
you
the
money
with
interest
i
have
small
faith
in
the
success
of
your
plans
richard
i
have
been
as
lucky
as
you
sister
helen
i
admit
but
where
would
you
have
been
but
for
your
lucky
marriage
as
to
that
i
have
always
taken
care
of
myself
said
his
sister
coldly
may
be
so
there
are
some
born
to
good
luck
how
much
money
do
you
expect
me
to
give
you
asked
kent
dick
looked
at
his
sister
face
attentively
he
wished
to
judge
how
much
there
was
a
chance
of
getting
out
of
her
his
survey
was
not
particularly
encouraging
she
did
appear
to
be
a
woman
easily
wheedled
out
of
her
money
still
he
spoke
up
boldly
and
said
a
loan
of
five
hundred
dollars
helen
would
be
a
great
lift
to
me
i
have
no
doubt
it
would
said
kent
quietly
but
if
you
have
any
expectation
of
getting
that
sum
from
me
you
know
very
little
of
me
i
should
be
a
fool
to
throw
away
such
a
sum
of
money
you
would
be
generous
i
have
no
ambition
to
be
considered
generous
she
answered
coldly
a
fool
and
his
money
are
soon
parted
you
appear
to
take
me
for
a
fool
but
i
beg
to
assure
you
that
you
are
entirely
mistaken
how
much
will
you
lend
me
then
asked
dick
rather
sullenly
do
use
that
ridiculous
word
when
you
know
there
no
probability
of
your
ever
repaying
it
even
if
you
should
be
able
have
your
own
way
helen
i
will
give
you
fifty
dollars
though
in
justice
to
my
boy
i
ought
not
to
do
so
fifty
dollars
repeated
dick
chagrined
why
that
do
pay
me
for
coming
east
you
are
right
you
would
have
done
better
to
stay
where
you
were
you
do
seem
to
consider
helen
that
we
had
met
for
years
and
i
wanted
to
see
my
only
sister
suppose
i
had
had
no
money
would
you
have
come
then
asked
kent
with
contemptuous
incredulity
no
i
could
have
afforded
it
but
helen
fifty
dollars
is
nothing
at
all
you
might
say
a
hundred
i
might
say
a
hundred
but
there
is
no
chance
that
i
shall
are
you
not
ashamed
a
great
strong
man
as
you
are
not
to
be
able
to
support
yourself
and
wife
without
help
from
me
luck
been
agin
me
said
dick
sullenly
i
could
have
got
ahead
but
for
that
how
has
it
been
against
you
i
owned
a
mining
claim
in
california
it
did
pay
anything
and
i
sold
it
for
ten
dollars
the
man
i
sold
it
to
kept
working
till
he
struck
a
vein
he
cleared
ten
thousand
dollars
as
you
might
have
done
if
you
had
despaired
too
quickly
oh
well
it
easy
enough
to
criticise
helen
you
struck
a
vein
and
you
in
luck
no
more
hard
work
for
you
there
would
be
if
i
gave
away
my
money
five
hundred
dollars
at
a
time
you
need
complain
of
my
good
fortune
i
have
had
my
share
of
work
to
do
now
i
am
comfortable
and
i
mean
to
keep
so
no
matter
what
becomes
of
your
poor
brother
whined
dick
my
poor
brother
must
work
as
i
have
done
and
he
wo
starve
do
you
think
if
i
were
a
man
she
said
disdainfully
that
i
would
stoop
to
ask
help
of
a
woman
well
let
me
have
the
money
then
said
dick
gloomily
kent
drew
from
her
five
bills
and
placed
them
in
his
hand
do
expect
any
further
help
she
said
in
justice
to
my
son
i
must
refuse
it
dick
left
the
house
with
an
execration
was
there
ever
a
more
selfish
woman
he
muttered
all
for
her
son
is
it
i
like
to
choke
the
whelp
with
this
sentiment
the
affectionate
uncle
left
his
sister
house
chapter
xxxiv
an
important
commission
it
was
nearly
a
year
later
and
jasper
kent
still
remained
in
louis
and
in
the
employ
of
herman
fitch
he
had
won
his
way
to
the
favor
of
his
employer
not
alone
on
account
of
his
personal
good
qualities
but
because
in
the
way
of
business
he
manifested
an
unusual
aptitude
for
this
reason
he
had
already
had
his
pay
raised
to
fifteen
dollars
a
week
and
was
thoroughly
trusted
even
in
matters
of
importance
of
this
he
was
about
to
receive
an
additional
proof
jasper
said
fitch
one
day
as
our
hero
entered
his
how
would
you
like
a
little
journey
jasper
eyes
brightened
i
would
like
nothing
better
he
answered
promptly
so
i
supposed
young
men
of
your
age
generally
like
to
travel
to
what
place
do
you
wish
me
to
go
may
i
ask
sir
to
kansas
a
small
town
named
plattville
very
well
sir
i
will
go
the
business
is
this
a
firm
in
that
town
watts
duncan
are
considerably
indebted
to
me
and
i
have
doubts
as
their
solvency
in
the
event
of
their
failure
i
want
to
realize
as
much
as
possible
of
my
claim
i
do
want
the
other
creditors
to
forestall
me
yes
sir
i
see
it
is
rather
a
delicate
commission
you
perceive
you
are
to
go
there
and
quietly
find
out
what
you
can
of
their
affairs
and
report
to
me
by
mail
then
i
shall
send
you
instructions
how
to
proceed
very
well
sir
some
might
blame
me
for
sending
so
young
a
messenger
but
i
have
two
objects
in
view
a
boy
of
your
age
will
not
excite
suspicion
and
again
i
repose
great
confidence
in
you
jasper
was
not
a
little
gratified
by
this
assurance
i
will
try
not
to
disappoint
your
expectations
he
said
earnestly
i
do
think
you
will
when
do
you
want
me
to
start
i
be
ready
said
jasper
briskly
you
can
go
a
part
of
the
way
by
rail
but
only
a
part
it
is
a
frontier
town
and
you
may
have
to
ride
horseback
a
part
of
the
way
that
i
must
leave
to
your
judgment
all
the
better
said
jasper
i
see
you
do
mind
roughing
it
said
fitch
no
that
the
best
part
of
it
well
you
may
go
home
now
and
make
preparations
morning
come
to
the
office
for
instructions
and
money
one
thing
only
i
suggest

as
little
baggage
as
possible
it
would
only
be
in
your
way

got
a
small
knapsack
that
will
hold
all
i
want
to
carry
good
be
here
at
nine
at
the
appointed
hour
jasper
received
his
instructions
and
a
certain
sum
of
money
he
had
provided
himself
with
a
belt
into
which
he
put
the
money
to
guard
against
possible
robbery
carrying
only
a
few
dollars
in
a
for
outward
show
in
explanation
of
these
precautions
it
must
be
stated
that
the
events
which
i
am
describing
took
place
some
years
since
when
kansas
was
more
sparsely
settled
and
life
less
secure
than
at
present
he
received
his
instructions
and
set
out
on
his
journey
secretly
envied
by
other
clerks
who
had
been
longer
in
the
office
than
himself
but
who
had
not
been
complimented
by
having
a
similar
trust
reposed
in
them
we
will
follow
him
and
see
how
he
fares
chapter
xxxv
an
indian
maiden
from
the
information
afforded
by
his
employer
jasper
was
led
to
expect
a
somewhat
adventurous
journey
he
was
not
to
be
disappointed
as
long
as
he
was
in
the
part
of
the
country
he
encountered
no
difficulties
nor
adventures
worth
recording
plattville
as
already
stated
was
a
frontier
town
and
there
was
a
large
tract
of
almost
uninhabited
country
between
it
and
the
nearest
settlement
late
in
the
afternoon
of
the
fourth
day
jasper
found
himself
standing
on
the
bank
of
a
river
which
must
be
crossed
there
was
no
boat
in
sight
and
he
was
puzzled
what
to
do
while
he
was
considering
a
young
indian
girl
glided
by
in
a
canoe
she
handled
the
paddle
dexterously
and
as
one
who
had
been
long
accustomed
to
the
exercise
though
she
did
not
look
more
than
twelve
years
of
age
i
wonder
if
she
understands
english
thought
jasper
perhaps
i
could
get
her
to
ferry
me
across
acting
upon
this
thought
he
called
out
halloo
there
the
young
girl
turned
quickly
and
discovered
jasper
whom
she
had
not
before
seen
she
stopped
paddling
and
asked
in
a
musical
voice
white
boy
speak
yes
said
jasper
do
you
speak
english
a
little
i
want
to
go
across
the
river
will
you
take
me
in
your
canoe
the
girl
hesitated
a
moment
perhaps
from
uncertainty
as
to
whether
she
could
trust
our
hero
for
she
surveyed
him
attentively
it
appeared
that
her
impressions
were
favorable
for
she
turned
her
canoe
to
the
shore
and
said
simply
yes
thank
you
said
jasper
and
he
promptly
took
his
place
in
the
frail
craft
the
indian
girl
pushed
off
and
began
to
paddle
rapidly
it
seems
odd
to
be
ferried
by
a
girl
thought
jasper
i
think
i
ought
to
offer
to
take
her
place
shall
i
paddle
instead
of
you
he
asked
the
girl
laughed
and
shook
her
head
white
boy
not
know
how
to
paddle
a
canoe
tip
it
over
and
she
laughed
again
i
do
know
but
i
should
thought
jasper
as
he
noticed
how
light
and
frail
the
little
canoe
was
and
how
a
slight
motion
would
agitate
it
do
you
live
around
here
he
asked
in
some
curiosity
up
the
river
said
the
girl
indicating
with
her
head
for
her
hands
were
occupied
have
you
a
father
monima
father
great
chief
said
the
girl
proudly
monima
is
that
your
name
yes
it
is
a
pretty
name
the
girl
laughed
and
appeared
to
be
pleased
with
the
compliment
though
it
was
only
to
her
name
she
seemed
in
turn
to
be
possessed
by
curiosity
for
she
asked
what
white
boy
name
jasper
jasper
she
repeated
with
difficulty
is
it
a
pretty
name
no
said
monima
laughing
i
am
sorry
you
do
like
it
monima
i
like
white
boy
he
will
be
big
warrior
some
day
i
do
know
about
that
monima
so
your
father
is
a
chief
yes
said
monima
proudly
great
chief
did
he
give
you
this
canoe
yes
have
you
any
brothers
and
sisters
one
brother
young
man
no
sister
by
this
time
they
had
reached
the
other
side
monima
skilfully
drew
up
the
canoe
alongside
and
jasper
jumped
out
he
stood
on
the
bank
and
drew
from
his
a
silver
which
he
handed
to
monima
monima
no
want
money
said
the
girl
proudly
keep
it
to
remember
white
boy
said
jasper
monima
will
remember
white
boy
without
money
jasper
reluctantly
put
the
money
in
his
pocket
but
he
did
not
like
to
accept
the
favor
from
monima
without
rendering
her
some
return
he
was
in
doubt
at
first
but
finally
an
idea
occurred
to
him
he
had
half
a
dozen
photographs
of
himself
which
he
had
recently
had
taken
in
louis
he
drew
out
one
of
these
and
extended
it
to
monima
take
that
monima
he
said
keep
that
and
remember
me
monima
face
lighted
up
with
wonder
and
admiration
when
she
saw
the
photograph
for
she
had
never
seen
one
before
she
looked
from
the
picture
to
jasper
and
from
jasper
back
again
to
the
picture
and
laughed
softly
white
boy
picture
she
said
yes
monima
do
you
think
it
looks
like
me
she
nodded
emphatically
two
white
boy
here
and
there
she
said
pointing
first
to
the
picture
then
to
jasper
monima
he
said
but
the
indian
girl
was
evidently
tired
of
the
river
for
she
fastened
the
canoe
and
walked
by
his
side
he
kept
up
a
conversation
for
some
time
till
she
turned
aside
and
entered
a
path
which
led
into
the
woods
does
your
father
live
there
he
asked
yes
said
monima
he
said
she
did
say
but
uttered
a
word
which
was
probably
the
indian
equivalent
for
it
and
was
soon
lost
to
his
sight
well
that
romantic
to
begin
with
thought
jasper
the
daughter
of
a
great
chief
has
ferried
me
across
the
river
and
i
have
given
her
my
photograph
the
next
romantic
thing
that
happens
to
me
may
be
my
losing
my
way
but
i
hope
not
he
had
a
general
idea
of
the
way
he
wanted
to
go
but
after
awhile
he
became
perplexed
and
was
led
to
doubt
whether
he
had
not
gone
astray
i
wish
i
could
find
somebody
to
guide
me
he
thought
he
had
his
wish
a
few
rods
farther
on
he
came
upon
a
man
stretched
upon
the
grass
under
a
tree
i
have
lost
my
way
he
began
but
before
he
could
finish
the
sentence
the
man
sprang
to
his
feet
and
to
his
dismay
he
recognized
jack
the
man
who
had
had
him
locked
up
in
louis
chapter
xxxvi
in
difficulties
jack
looked
at
first
surprised
then
smiled
with
malicious
joy
as
he
recognized
the
boy
who
accosted
him
ha
my
chicken
it
you
is
it
he
said
you
remember
me
you
yes
i
remember
you
said
jasper
i
thought
i
get
hold
of
you
again
some
time
said
jack
but
hang
me
if
i
expected
to
find
you
out
here
what
brings
you
here
i
came
here
on
business
said
jasper
so
you
are
a
man
of
business
are
you
sneered
the
burglar
i
am
in
the
employ
of
herman
fitch
of
st
louis
the
father
of
the
boy
that
dick
kidnapped
yes
did
he
send
you
out
here
yes
what
for
on
a
little
matter
of
business
said
jasper
with
reserve
oh
that
it
well
you
did
expect
the
pleasure
of
seeing
me
did
you
i
do
consider
it
a
pleasure
said
jasper
boldly
ha
you
are
a
bold
boy
i
speak
the
truth
well
it
is
always
best
to
speak
the
truth
said
jack
frowning
shall
i
lie
to
you
then
do
be
impudent
i
sha
say
i
am
glad
to
see
you
when
i
am
not
perhaps
you
are
right
boy
you
will
have
no
reason
to
be
glad
to
see
me
follow
me
i
would
rather
not
follow
me
or
i
will
drive
this
knife
into
you
said
jack
savagely
displaying
a
weapon
which
he
carried
in
his
girdle
resistance
would
have
been
unavailing
and
dangerous
and
jasper
obeyed
resolved
however
to
escape
at
the
first
opportunity
jack
led
the
way
into
the
woods
not
far
however
and
finally
paused
under
a
large
tree
sit
down
he
said
imperiously
he
threw
himself
down
on
the
green
sward
and
jasper
not
very
comfortable
in
mind
sat
down
near
him
now
young
fellow
said
jack
i
got
some
questions
to
ask
you
i
suppose
he
is
going
to
ask
me
about
my
escape
thought
jasper
and
he
was
right
how
did
you
get
away
from
that
room
where
you
were
locked
up
i
got
out
of
the
said
jasper
how
did
you
get
out
of
the
house
did
the
old
man
help
you
no
said
jasper
did
you
go
out
through
the
front
door
no
do
keep
me
asking
questions
said
jack
harshly
how
did
you
get
out
then
through
the
door
in
the
roof
from
there
i
got
in
through
the
window
into
a
room
in
the
next
house
ha
said
jack
i
never
thought
of
that
did
you
have
any
trouble
with
the
people
there
no
i
got
into
the
room
of
a
german
who
let
me
spend
the
night
with
him
and
take
breakfast
so
that
the
way
you
managed
it
yes
jasper
felt
relieved
that
no
question
had
been
asked
him
as
to
agency
in
effecting
his
release
he
would
not
have
betrayed
her
at
any
rate
but
his
refusal
to
speak
might
have
incensed
jack
well
he
said
so
much
for
that
now
how
much
money
have
you
got
with
you
this
was
a
question
which
jasper
had
expected
and
dreaded
to
hear
for
nearly
all
the
money
in
his
possession
belonged
to
his
employer
and
not
to
himself
well
boy
i
want
an
answer
said
jack
impatiently
jasper
reluctantly
drew
out
his
containing
as
we
know
but
a
small
portion
of
his
money
jack
took
it
and
opening
it
counted
the
money
only
twelve
dollars
he
exclaimed
in
disgust
and
disappointment
do
take
it
said
jasper
affecting
to
be
very
much
disturbed
what
business
have
you
out
here
with
such
a
paltry
sum
as
twelve
dollars
demanded
jack
angrily
that
my
business
said
jasper
what
do
you
mean
boy
it
certainly
is
your
business
how
much
money
my
employer
gave
me
for
expenses
did
he
expect
you
to
make
the
whole
journey
on
this
contemptible
sum
no
where
the
rest
then
i
am
to
collect
some
money
before
i
return
answered
jasper
with
a
lucky
thought
jack
felt
disappointed
the
money
jasper
was
about
to
collect
would
do
him
no
good
as
doubtless
the
boy
would
take
good
care
if
once
released
not
to
be
caught
again
that
a
miserable
way
of
doing
business
said
jack
suppose
you
should
collect
it
then
i
must
write
to
the
firm
to
send
some
money
this
gave
jack
an
idea
on
which
he
afterward
acted
but
continued
jasper
desirous
of
getting
back
some
of
the
money
in
the
if
you
take
away
all
my
money
i
ca
get
to
plattville
to
make
collections
is
that
where
you
are
to
collect
money
yes
will
you
promise
me
the
money
after
you
have
collected
it
no
answered
jasper
you
wo
eh
no
i
have
no
right
to
the
money
wo
belong
to
me
that
makes
no
difference
it
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference
to
me
look
here
boy
said
jack
frowning
you
evidently
do
know
the
man
you
talking
to
you
ai
going
to
bluff
me
off
in
that
way
and
he
reinforced
this
declaration
with
an
oath
i
am
trying
to
be
faithful
to
my
employer
said
jasper
you
got
to
be
faithful
to
me
what
claim
have
you
on
me
asked
jasper
you
in
my
power
that
the
claim
i
have
do
you
understand
that
i
understand
what
you
mean
said
jasper
then
i
only
to
say
that
it
be
best
for
you
to
remember
it
tell
me
again
what
you
want
what
i
did
want
was
that
you
should
collect
this
money
and
bring
it
to
me
i
refuse
you
need
for
i
do
intend
to
let
you
go
out
of
my
sight
i
trust
you
no
i
have
another
plan
in
view
jasper
did
not
ask
what
it
was
he
felt
sure
that
it
was
nothing
that
he
would
be
willing
to
do
what
is
the
name
of
your
employer
herman
fitch
very
good
jack
drew
from
his
pocket
a
small
a
pen
and
some
paper
now
said
he
i
want
you
to
write
a
letter
write
a
letter
to
whom
inquired
jasper
in
surprise
to
this
man
fitch
telling
him
that
you
have
had
your
pocket
picked
and
need
some
money
tell
him
you
will
need
at
least
dollars
as
you
have
been
able
to
collect
anything
i
ca
do
it
said
jasper
ca
do
it
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
by
such
a
letter
i
should
deceive
my
employer
and
be
obtaining
money
from
him
by
false
pretenses
i
ca
do
it
look
here
boy
said
jack
sternly
you
do
know
the
man
you
are
trifling
with
i
am
a
desperate
man
and
will
stick
at
nothing
i
have
taken
life
before
and
i
am
ready
to
do
so
again
write
this
letter
or
i
will
kill
you
jasper
listened
with
horror
to
this
terrible
confession
and
his
equally
terrible
threat
would
you
take
my
life
for
dollars
he
said
yes
your
life
is
nothing
to
me
and
i
need
the
money
quick
your
answer
as
he
spoke
he
drew
out
a
long
knife
and
approached
jasper
menacingly
it
was
a
terrible
moment
jack
looked
as
if
he
fully
intended
to
carry
out
his
threat
at
any
rate
there
was
danger
of
it
on
the
one
side
was
death
on
the
other
breach
of
trust
finally
he
decided
you
may
kill
me
if
you
will
he
said
at
length
but
i
wo
write
the
letter
jack
uttered
an
execration
and
raised
the
knife
but
suddenly
he
uttered
a
stifled
cry
and
fell
to
the
ground
with
blood
spurting
from
a
wound
in
his
breast
jasper
bounded
to
his
feet
in
astonishment
he
had
shut
his
eyes
expecting
death
his
first
glance
was
at
the
prostrate
brigand
he
saw
that
the
wound
was
made
by
an
arrow
which
had
penetrated
the
region
of
the
heart
but
who
had
sped
the
shaft
and
was
he
also
in
danger
the
question
was
soon
answered
out
from
the
underbrush
emerged
three
figures
the
foremost
was
the
indian
maiden
monima
following
her
were
two
men
of
the
same
tribe
it
was
one
of
these
who
had
shot
at
jack
is
white
boy
hurt
asked
monima
running
to
jasper
and
surveying
him
anxiously
no
said
jasper
thank
you
monima
monima
is
glad
said
the
indian
girl
joyfully
jack
groaned
and
jasper
came
to
his
side
and
addressed
him
compassionately
though
but
a
minute
before
jack
had
been
about
to
take
his
life
he
saw
that
the
blood
was
gushing
forth
from
his
wound
is
he
badly
wounded
asked
jasper
turning
to
monima
she
said
something
in
her
native
language
to
the
two
men
they
spoke
briefly
shaking
their
heads
white
man
will
die
she
said
interpreting
to
jasper
our
hero
was
shocked
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
witnessed
a
violent
death
and
it
struck
him
with
horror
he
kneeled
by
jack
side
just
then
the
wounded
man
opened
his
eyes
who
shot
me
he
asked
with
difficulty
the
indians
jack
glance
fell
upon
the
two
men
and
he
tried
to
lift
himself
up
but
the
effort
caused
his
wound
to
bleed
more
copiously
he
burst
into
a
volley
of
oaths
which
in
his
state
shocked
jasper
do
swear
he
said
would
you
go
into
the
presence
of
god
with
an
oath
in
your
mouth
jack
face
grew
livid
with
terror
who
says
i
am
going
to
die
he
asked
wildly
the
indians
say
you
can
not
live
said
jasper
gravely
it
a
lie
exclaimed
jack
violently
i
live
to
kill
you
all
as
he
spoke
he
plucked
the
arrow
from
his
breast
but
this
only
hastened
his
death
he
fell
back
exhausted
and
in
five
minutes
breathed
his
last
jasper
looked
so
shocked
that
the
indian
girl
said
in
a
tone
of
surprise
is
white
boy
sorry
yes
said
jasper
what
for
he
try
to
kill
white
boy
yes
but
it
seems
awful
to
see
him
killed
so
suddenly
i
wish
he
could
have
lived
long
enough
to
repent
monima
could
not
understand
this
he
bad
man
she
said
emphatically
he
try
to
kill
white
boy
monima
white
boy
friend
jasper
took
the
hand
of
monima
gratefully
and
said
you
have
saved
me
monima
but
for
you
he
would
have
killed
me
the
indian
girl
eyes
lighted
up
but
she
only
said
monima
is
glad
how
fortunate
that
i
fell
in
with
her
thought
jasper
and
that
i
made
a
friend
of
her
where
white
boy
go
asked
monima
i
do
know
said
jasper
doubtfully
come
to
my
father
lodge
in
the
morning
monima
will
show
the
way
thank
you
monima
said
our
hero
i
will
go
he
felt
that
he
could
not
refuse
such
an
offer
from
one
who
had
rendered
him
such
a
service
moreover
it
relieved
him
from
embarrassment
as
he
would
not
have
known
otherwise
where
to
pass
the
night
which
was
now
close
at
hand
chapter
xxxvii
a
startling
summons
the
indian
encampment
was
only
half
a
mile
away
there
were
assembled
about
fifty
persons
men
women
and
children
lying
on
the
grass
about
the
tents
monima
favor
was
sufficient
to
insure
a
cordial
reception
to
jasper
who
was
pressed
to
partake
of
supper
an
offer
he
was
glad
to
accept
for
it
was
now
seven
hours
since
he
had
eaten
food
after
the
repast
a
pipe
was
offered
him
but
this
he
declined
explaining
that
he
never
had
learned
to
smoke
on
the
whole
he
enjoyed
the
adventure
except
that
he
could
not
help
thinking
from
time
to
time
of
his
late
companion
cut
off
so
suddenly
he
learned
from
monima
that
her
two
attendants
had
remained
behind
and
buried
jack
under
the
tree
where
he
had
been
killed
at
night
he
slept
on
skins
in
one
of
the
tents
and
in
the
morning
he
was
guided
on
his
way
by
monima
as
far
as
the
road
the
indian
maiden
looked
sad
when
they
were
about
to
part
when
will
white
boy
come
back
she
said
i
do
know
monima
i
hope
to
see
you
again
some
time
but
perhaps
you
wo
remember
me
monima
never
forgets
she
answered
and
i
shall
not
forget
attached
to
his
watch
was
a
silver
chain
which
he
had
bought
in
louis
three
months
before
he
had
noticed
momma
look
of
admiration
directed
toward
it
and
he
determined
to
give
it
to
her
detaching
his
watch
from
it
he
held
it
out
to
the
indian
girl
take
it
monima
he
said
it
is
a
gift
of
friendship
she
uttered
a
cry
of
pleasure
you
give
it
to
monima
she
said
half
incredulous
yes
he
said
and
i
have
nothing
to
give
white
boy
she
said
sadly
you
have
given
me
my
life
is
that
nothing
monima
keep
the
chain
and
whenever
you
look
at
it
remember
jasper
so
they
parted
and
jasper
pursued
his
journey
to
plattville
he
reached
the
town
without
further
adventure
and
conducted
satisfactorily
the
business
with
which
he
was
intrusted
he
succeeded
in
obtaining
half
the
money
due
his
employer
and
in
making
arrangements
for
the
speedy
payment
of
the
rest
so
it
was
with
a
mind
well
satisfied
that
he
returned
to
louis
when
he
told
fitch
the
particulars
of
his
encounter
with
jack
and
his
escape
the
latter
said
earnestly
jasper
you
are
the
bravest
boy
i
know
i
am
afraid
you
overrate
my
services
said
jasper
modestly
and
you
really
refused
to
write
the
letter
though
you
knew
your
life
was
in
danger
i
was
not
willing
to
betray
my
trust
i
honor
your
courage
and
fidelity
but
you
carried
them
too
far
we
would
far
rather
have
lost
ten
times
dollars
than
risked
your
life
i
did
think
of
that
i
only
thought
it
would
be
wrong
to
defraud
you
we
shall
not
forget
your
fidelity
you
may
consider
your
wages
raised
to
twenty
dollars
a
week
thank
you
sir
said
jasper
gratified
it
is
not
merely
on
account
of
your
courage
and
fidelity
but
partly
because
of
the
business
ability
you
have
shown
in
carrying
on
this
affair
again
jasper
thanked
his
employer
and
went
about
his
duties
with
fresh
courage
feeling
that
his
services
were
appreciated
i
am
glad
i
came
to
louis
he
thought
how
much
better
i
am
situated
than
i
should
have
been
at
home
tyrannized
over
by
a
by
whom
i
was
disliked
three
months
more
passed
when
one
day
a
boy
entered
the
store
is
jasper
kent
here
he
asked
yes
said
jasper
coming
forward
that
is
my
name
i
have
a
telegram
for
you
said
the
boy
jasper
tore
it
open
and
read
these
words
come
home
at
once
your
is
dying
otis
miller
shocked
at
this
startling
intelligence
jasper
at
once
sought
his
employer
obtained
leave
of
absence
and
took
the
next
train
bound
east
we
must
precede
him
and
explain
what
had
happened
and
what
occasioned
kent
critical
condition
chapter
xxxviii
dick
comes
back
when
kent
brother
left
her
house
with
fifty
dollars
in
his
pocket
she
warned
him
that
it
was
the
last
money
he
could
expect
to
receive
from
her
he
did
not
reply
but
he
had
no
intention
of
remaining
satisfied
with
so
little
what
is
fifty
dollars
he
thought
to
my
sister
fortune
she
need
think
she
has
got
rid
of
me
so
easily
at
that
time
he
expected
to
make
her
another
visit
in
the
course
of
a
month
or
two
but
circumstances
prevented
the
fact
is
he
was
imprudent
enough
to
commit
theft
and
incautious
enough
to
be
detected
not
long
afterward
and
the
consequence
was
a
term
of
imprisonment
when
he
was
released
from
confinement
he
at
once
made
his
way
to
his
sister
house
as
before
nicholas
was
standing
on
the
lawn
his
countenance
changed
when
he
recognized
his
uncle
though
he
did
know
that
he
had
just
come
from
a
prison
how
are
you
nicholas
said
his
uncle
i
well
said
his
nephew
coldly
really
you
have
grown
a
good
deal
since
i
saw
you
even
this
compliment
did
not
soften
nicholas
who
turned
his
back
and
did
not
invite
his
uncle
into
the
house
dick
scowled
in
an
ugly
manner
but
controlled
his
voice
how
is
your
mother
she
got
the
headache
i
am
sorry
i
have
been
sick
too
nicholas
did
not
exhibit
the
slightest
curiosity
on
the
subject
i
have
just
come
from
the
hospital
a
slight
fiction
as
we
know
this
aroused
nicholas
who
retreated
a
little
as
he
asked
did
you
have
anything
catching
no
besides
i
well
now
i
should
like
to
see
your
mother
i
do
think
she
feels
well
enough
to
see
you
will
you
go
up
and
see
i
want
to
see
her
on
important
business
nicholas
went
up
stairs
grumbling
well
mother
he
said
that
disreputable
brother
of
yours
has
come
again
kent
brow
contracted
where
is
he
she
asked
down
stairs
he
wants
to
see
you
he
says
how
does
he
look
worse
than
ever
he
says
he
has
just
come
from
a
hospital
from
a
hospital
he
has
a
good
deal
of
assurance
to
come
here
said
kent
with
a
hard
look
so
he
has
i
will
tell
you
why
said
his
mother
in
a
lower
tone
he
has
not
told
you
the
truth
he
has
not
come
from
a
hospital
as
he
represents
why
should
he
say
so
then
asked
nicholas
surprised
because
he
did
like
to
say
prison
has
he
been
in
prison
how
do
you
know
i
saw
an
account
in
the
papers
of
his
arrest
and
conviction
i
suppose
he
has
just
come
out
of
prison
why
did
you
tell
me
of
this
before
mother
i
wanted
to
keep
the
disgrace
secret
on
account
of
the
relationship
when
he
finds
i
know
it
i
shall
soon
be
rid
of
him
will
you
see
him
then
yes
i
will
go
down
stairs
and
you
may
tell
him
to
come
in
two
minutes
later
the
entered
his
sister
presence
he
read
no
welcome
in
her
face
hang
it
he
said
you
do
seem
very
glad
to
see
your
only
brother
you
are
right
she
said
i
do
not
seem
glad
and
i
do
not
feel
glad
his
face
darkened
as
he
sank
heavily
into
an
i
suppose
i
a
poor
relation
he
said
bitterly
that
the
reason
is
it
no
you
treat
me
better
if
i
came
here
rich
and
prosperous
probably
i
would
did
i
say
so
you
have
any
feelings
for
the
poor
i
have
any
feeling
for
criminals
said
kent
in
a
sharp
voice
he
uttered
a
stifled
oath
and
his
face
flushed
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
i
mean
that
you
came
here
straight
from
a
prison
deny
it
if
you
can
she
said
sternly
he
hesitated
then
he
said
i
not
the
only
innocent
man
that
been
locked
up
you
ca
deceive
me
she
answered
though
you
protest
your
innocence
all
day
i
shall
not
believe
you
i
feel
sure
that
you
were
guilty
of
the
crime
for
which
you
were
punished
it
rather
hard
that
my
own
flesh
and
blood
should
turn
against
me
you
have
disgraced
the
family
said
kent
i
discard
you
i
no
longer
look
upon
you
as
my
brother
if
you
had
not
turned
me
off
with
such
a
pittance
it
would
have
happened
he
said
sullenly
out
of
your
abundance
you
only
gave
me
fifty
dollars
and
you
a
stout
man
must
accept
charity
or
steal
she
said
sarcastically
luck
has
always
been
against
me
your
own
bad
habits
have
always
been
against
you
look
here
said
he
doggedly
i
wo
stand
any
more
of
that
even
from
my
own
sister
very
well
what
have
you
come
here
for
i
out
of
money
and
you
expect
me
to
supply
you
i
think
you
might
give
me
a
little
just
to
get
along
i
shall
not
give
you
a
cent
you
have
no
claim
upon
me
i
have
already
said
that
i
no
longer
look
upon
you
as
a
brother
is
that
all
you
got
to
say
demanded
dick
his
face
growing
dark
with
anger
it
is
my
final
determination
then
all
i
got
to
say
is
you
repent
it
to
the
last
day
of
your
life
he
burst
out
furiously
i
go
away
here
he
arose
but
never
forget
your
cruelty
and
harshness
he
strode
out
of
the
room
and
she
looked
after
him
coldly
it
is
as
well
she
said
to
herself
now
he
understands
that
there
is
no
more
to
be
got
out
of
me
i
hope
i
shall
never
lay
eyes
upon
him
again
well
said
nicholas
entering
directly
afterward
what
have
you
said
to
him
he
dashed
out
of
the
yard
looking
as
black
as
a
i
told
him
that
he
had
disgraced
the
family
and
i
should
never
more
acknowledge
him
as
a
brother
i
glad
you
sent
him
off
with
a
flea
in
his
ear
i
do
want
to
see
him
around
here
again
i
do
think
we
shall
there
was
one
thing
kent
forgot
her
brother
brutal
temper
and
appetite
for
revenge
had
she
thought
of
this
she
would
perhaps
have
been
more
cautious
about
provoking
him
in
the
middle
of
the
night
kent
awoke
with
a
strange
sense
of
oppression
the
cause
of
which
she
did
not
immediately
understand
as
soon
as
she
recovered
her
senses
she
comprehended
the
occasion
the
crackling
flames
and
the
fearful
thought
burst
upon
her
the
house
is
on
fire
she
threw
on
her
dress
and
dashed
hastily
from
the
room
she
was
about
to
seek
the
quickest
mode
of
exit
when
she
thought
of
nicholas
he
might
be
asleep
unconscious
of
his
peril
she
was
a
cold
and
selfish
woman
but
her
one
redeeming
trait
was
her
affection
for
her
son
she
rushed
frantically
to
his
chamber
screaming
nicholas
wake
up
the
house
is
on
fire
she
entered
his
chamber
but
he
was
not
in
it
he
had
already
escaped
and
full
of
selfish
thoughts
of
his
own
safety
had
fled
without
giving
heed
to
his
mother
though
there
would
have
been
time
for
him
to
save
her
he
is
safe
thought
kent
and
relieved
of
this
anxiety
she
sought
to
escape
but
the
flames
had
gained
too
much
headway
her
dress
caught
fire
and
she
ran
frantically
about
ignorant
that
in
so
doing
she
increased
the
peril
she
was
barely
conscious
of
being
seized
and
borne
out
by
friendly
hands
but
though
the
flames
were
extinguished
she
had
already
received
fatal
injuries
she
lingered
till
the
afternoon
of
the
following
day
and
then
died
meanwhile
miller
sent
jasper
the
telegram
already
referred
to
nicholas
looked
serious
when
he
was
informed
of
his
mother
death
but
his
was
not
a
temperament
to
be
seriously
affected
by
the
misfortune
of
another
his
own
interests
were
uppermost
in
his
mind
will
i
get
mother
property
he
asked
miller
while
that
mother
lay
dead
and
disfigured
in
his
presence
this
is
no
time
to
speak
of
property
said
miller
coldly
you
ought
to
think
of
your
poor
mother
fate
of
course
i
do
said
nicholas
trying
to
look
sorrowful
but
i
want
to
know
how
i
going
to
be
situated
wait
till
after
the
funeral
at
any
rate
said
the
other
disgusted
chapter
xxxix
how
it
all
ended
jasper
did
not
reach
home
till
after
the
funeral
had
taken
place
and
his
was
buried
though
he
had
little
reason
to
like
her
he
was
shocked
and
distressed
by
her
sad
and
untimely
fate
how
could
the
house
catch
fire
mr
miller
he
asked
it
is
supposed
to
have
been
set
on
fire
who
would
do
it
from
what
nicholas
tells
me
i
suspect
that
the
fire
was
the
work
of
kent
brother
her
brother
exclaimed
jasper
i
met
him
in
the
west
then
you
probably
know
that
he
was
not
a
very
respectable
character
i
know
that
he
was
concerned
in
kidnapping
a
child
nicholas
tells
me
that
he
had
just
got
out
of
prison
and
applied
to
kent
for
help
which
she
refused
incensed
at
this
he
probably
set
the
house
on
fire
i
think
he
would
be
capable
of
doing
it
has
he
been
arrested
not
yet
but
the
police
are
on
his
track
i
do
think
he
can
escape
nicholas
does
seem
to
take
his
mother
death
very
hard
no
i
am
disgusted
with
his
selfishness
he
seems
to
be
principally
concerned
about
property
which
she
leaves
i
suppose
he
will
inherit
it
yes
i
do
know
in
what
state
it
is
but
it
ought
to
amount
to
thirty
thousand
dollars
it
is
a
large
slice
of
your
father
fortune
i
do
not
begrudge
it
to
him
i
shall
have
enough
that
reminds
me
that
it
is
time
to
open
the
instrument
which
your
father
left
with
me
the
paper
was
opened
then
and
there
and
proved
to
contain
the
following
direction
that
in
case
jasper
and
his
did
not
get
along
harmoniously
his
old
friend
miller
was
empowered
and
requested
to
assume
the
guardianship
of
jasper
that
arrangement
suits
me
precisely
said
jasper
warmly
will
you
accept
the
trust
cheerfully
said
his
friend
i
do
think
there
is
any
danger
of
our
disagreeing
jasper
shook
his
head
if
there
should
be
any
disagreement
it
would
be
my
fault
he
said
but
wo
nicholas
need
a
guardian
yes
one
will
have
to
be
appointed
i
suppose
his
uncle
would
be
willing
to
take
the
post
his
uncle
if
found
will
hardly
be
in
a
position
to
act
in
that
capacity
dick
was
not
found
he
disappeared
and
from
that
day
was
not
seen
in
the
neighborhood
it
is
supposed
that
he
went
west
and
found
a
secure
concealment
in
some
of
the
distant
territories
where
probably
he
is
engaged
in
the
same
discreditable
courses
for
which
he
was
already
notorious
as
was
anticipated
nicholas
inherited
about
thirty
thousand
dollars
he
selected
as
his
guardian
the
young
physician
whom
his
mother
had
employed
in
her
husband
last
sickness
but
the
man
proved
faithless
to
his
trust
and
ran
away
with
the
entire
fortune
of
his
ward
leaving
him
absolutely
penniless
in
this
emergency
nicholas
humbled
and
mortified
appealed
to
jasper
to
help
him
with
his
guardian
permission
jasper
agreed
during
his
good
behavior
to
pay
for
his
use
an
annual
sum
of
five
hundred
dollars
urging
him
to
continue
at
school
but
this
did
not
suit
nicholas
he
obtained
a
place
in
new
york
where
he
soon
developed
fast
tendencies
and
ended
by
running
away
with
a
considerable
sum
of
money
belonging
to
his
employer
it
was
believed
that
he
went
to
california
his
employer
took
no
steps
to
apprehend
him
jasper
having
agreed
to
make
up
to
him
the
sum
nine
hundred
dollars
which
nicholas
had
appropriated
for
him
it
was
a
saving
since
by
his
conduct
nicholas
had
forfeited
the
annual
provision
he
had
agreed
to
make
for
him
and
what
became
of
jasper
by
his
guardian
advice
he
went
to
school
for
two
years
more
then
he
returned
to
louis
and
again
entered
the
employment
of
fitch
at
with
a
portion
of
his
property
he
bought
an
interest
in
the
business
and
became
junior
partner
and
is
now
one
of
the
most
respected
and
enterprising
young
business
men
in
that
flourishing
city
he
was
recently
united
in
marriage
to
a
charming
young
lady
the
daughter
of
a
prosperous
western
merchant
and
so
his
prospects
seem
as
bright
as
could
well
be
hoped
for
the
trials
of
his
early
life
are
safely
passed
by
his
honesty
courage
and
generosity
he
has
fairly
earned
the
happiness
which
he
enjoys
nor
has
he
forgotten
nancy
and
the
indian
maiden
who
rendered
him
so
essential
a
service
at
a
critical
point
in
his
fortunes
every
year
he
sends
them
a
handsome
present
choosing
the
articles
which
are
best
suited
to
gratify
their
tastes
monima

a
