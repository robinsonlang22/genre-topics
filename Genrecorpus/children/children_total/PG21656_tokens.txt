the

of

chapter
i
the
ingleton
family
on
a
certain
morning
just
a
week
before
christmas
the
little
world
of
school
at
chilcombe
hall
was
awake
and
stirring
at
an
unusually
early
hour
long
before
the
slightest
hint
of
dawn
showed
in
the
sky
the
lamps
were
lighted
in
the
corridors
maids
were
scuttling
about
bringing
in
breakfast
and
jones
the
gardener
assisted
by
his
eldest
boy
a
sturdy
grinning
urchin
of
twelve
was
beginning
the
process
of
carrying
down
piles
of
and
and
stacking
them
on
a
cart
which
was
waiting
in
the
drive
outside
miss
walters
dreading
the
christmas
rush
on
the
railway
had
determined
to
take
time
by
the
forelock
and
meant
to
pack
off
her
pupils
by
the
first
available
trains
trusting
they
would
most
of
them
reach
their
destinations
before
the
overcrowding
became
a
serious
problem
in
the
traffic
the
pupils
themselves
offered
no
objections
to
this
early
start
the
sooner
they
reached
home
and
began
the
holidays
so
much
the
better
from
their
point
of
view
it
was
fun
to
get
up
by
when
the
stars
were
still
shining
in
the
sky
fun
to
find
that
rules
were
relaxed
and
for
once
they
might
chatter
and
talk
as
they
pleased
fun
to
run
unreproved
along
the
passages
sing
on
the
stairs
and
twirl
one
another
round
in
an
impromptu
dance
in
the
hall
the
particular
occupants
of
the
blue
bedroom
had
been
astir
even
before
the
big
bell
clanged
for
rising
so
they
stole
a
march
over
rival
dormitories
performed
their
toilets
packed
their
strapped
their
wraps
and
proceeded
downstairs
to
the
where
cups
and
plates
were
just
being
laid
upon
the
it
was
quite
superfluous
energy
on
the
part
of
lilias
dulcie
gowan
and
bertha
for
as
a
matter
of
fact
not
one
of
them
was
on
the
list
of
earliest
departures
but
the
excitement
of
the
general
exodus
had
awakened
them
as
absolutely
as
the
advent
of
santa
claus
on
christmas
mornings
they
stood
round
the
fire
warming
their
hands
chatting
and
hailing
fresh
arrivals
who
hurried
into
the
hall
you
going
by
the
edith
you
lucker
my
train
does
start
till
ten
i
begged
and
implored
miss
walters
to
let
me
leave
by
the
early
one
and
wait
at
the
junction
but
she
would
not
hear
of
it
so
i
got
to
stop
here
kicking
my
heels
and
watch
you
others
whisked
away
it
a
grisly
shame
gowan
round
rosy
face
was
drawn
into
a
decided
pout
and
her
blue
eyes
were
full
of
she
had
to
be
sorry
for
her
own
grievance
because
nobody
else
had
either
time
or
much
inclination
to
sympathize
they
were
all
far
too
much
excited
about
their
own
concerns
well
you
get
off
sometime
i
suppose
returned
edith
airily
there
are
twelve
of
us
all
going
together
as
far
as
colminster
we
mean
to
cram
into
one
carriage
if
we
can
do
suppose
the
train
will
be
full
as
it
so
early
i
thought
you
were
coming
with
us
bertha
but
miss
hardy
says
you
not
dad
changed
his
mind
at
the
last
minute
and
promised
to
send
the
car
to
fetch
me
it
only
forty
miles
by
road
you
know
though
it
takes
hours
by
the
train
he
seemed
to
think
i
should
lose
either
myself
or
my
luggage
at
sheasby
junction
and
it
is
a
horrid
place
to
change
you
never
can
get
hold
of
a
porter
and
you
do
know
which
platform
start
from
how
are
you
going
home
lilias
asked
noreen
who
with
several
other
girls
had
joined
the
group
at
the
fire
lilias
squatting
on
the
fender
stretching
two
cold
hands
towards
the
blazing
sticks
looked
up
brightly
we
riding
astley
and
elton
are
to
fetch
rajah
and
peri
over
for
us
grandfather
said
they
needed
exercise
i
do
suppose
he
have
thought
of
it
only
dulcie
wrote
to
cousin
clare
and
begged
her
to
ask
him
wo
it
be
just
splendiferous
we
have
had
a
ride
the
whole
term
and
i
pining
to
see
rajah
grandfather
had
promised
to
let
us
ride
to
school
in
september
put
in
dulcie
but
everard
and
a
friend
of
his
commandeered
the
horses
and
went
to
rasebury
so
we
could
have
them
and
we
were
so
disappointed
i
do
hope
nothing
will
happen
to
stop
them
this
time
everard
was
to
arrive
home
yesterday
so
he
be
before
us
i
sha
ever
be
friends
with
him
again
if
he
plays
us
such
a
mean
trick
it
carriage
wheelbarrow
truck
it
seems
to
me
the
way
we
all
trotting
home
laughed
edith
if
i
could
have
my
choice
sprint
on
a
scooter
next
term
we
travel
by
private
aeroplane
specially
chartered
scoffed
noreen
i
do
mind
how
i
go
so
long
as
i
get
off
somehow
chirped
truie
thank
goodness
here
come
the
urns
at
last
i
began
to
think
breakfast
would
never
be
ready
we
want
to
have
time
to
eat
something
before
we
start
miss
walters
excellent
arrangements
had
left
ample
time
for
the
healthy
young
appetites
to
be
satisfied
before
the
taxis
arrived
at
the
door
to
convey
the
first
contingent
of
pupils
to
the
station
sixteen
girls
under
the
escort
of
a
mistress
took
their
departure
in
the
highest
of
spirits
packed
as
tightly
as
sardines
but
managing
to
wave
their
boxes
had
been
dispatched
the
previous
day
their
had
gone
on
by
cart
before
breakfast
and
would
be
waiting
for
them
at
the
station
where
jones
that
most
useful
factotum
would
by
special
arrangement
with
the
be
taking
their
tickets
before
the
ordinary
opening
of
the
though
the
departure
of
sixteen
girls
made
somewhat
of
a
clearance
at
chilcombe
hall
miss
walters
labors
were
not
yet
over
there
was
a
train
at
eight
and
a
train
at
ten
and
the
young
people
who
had
to
wait
for
these
found
it
difficult
to
know
how
to
employ
the
interval
until
it
was
their
turn
to
enter
the
taxis
by
nine
lilias
and
dulcie
ready
in
their
riding
habits
were
looking
eagerly
out
of
the
window
along
the
drive
which
led
to
the
gate
i
know
elton
would
be
early
said
dulcie
it
always
astley
who
stops
and
fusses
it
was
the
same
when
everard
went
you
do
think
there
a
hitch
do
you
uneasily
shall
we
get
a
horrid
yellow
envelope
and
a
message
to
say
by
train
it
would
be
bad
and
yet
it
as
likely
as
not
dulcie
fears
which
in
the
course
of
twenty
minutes
waiting
and
watching
had
almost
conjured
up
the
telegraph
boy
with
his
scarlet
bicycle
and
brown
leather
wallet
were
suddenly
dispelled
however
by
a
brisk
sound
of
trotting
and
a
moment
later
appeared
the
welcome
sight
of
her
grandfather
two
grooms
riding
up
to
the
house
each
leading
a
spare
horse
by
the
rein
those
schoolfellows
who
had
not
yet
departed
to
the
station
came
to
the
door
to
witness
the
interesting
start
a
sleek
horse
is
always
a
beautiful
object
and
the
girls
decided
unanimously
that
lilias
and
dulcie
were
lucky
to
be
carried
home
in
so
delightful
a
fashion
they
watched
them
admiringly
as
they
mounted
edith
stroked
rajah
smooth
neck
as
she
said
to
her
friends
riding
beats
motoring
in
my
opinion
she
vouchsafed
though
of
course
you
can
go
farther
in
a
car
perhaps
i
shall
pass
you
on
the
road
no
you
wo
for
we
taking
a
short
cut
across
country
we
always
choose
if
we
can
write
and
tell
me
if
you
get
a
they
sound
fearfully
thrillsome
see
you
again
in
january
and
a
merry
christmas
to
everybody
added
dulcie
turning
on
her
saddle
to
wave
a
parting
salute
to
those
who
were
left
behind
on
the
doorstep
the
two
girls
walked
their
horses
down
the
drive
but
once
out
on
the
level
road
they
trotted
on
briskly
with
the
grooms
riding
behind
they
formed
quite
a
little
cavalcade
as
they
turned
from
the
hard
motor
track
down
the
grassy
lane
where
a
dilapidated
pointed
to
ringfield
and
cheverley
it
was
a
distance
of
seven
good
country
miles
from
chilcombe
hall
to
cheverley
chase
and
as
the
events
of
this
story
center
largely
round
lilias
and
dulcie
there
will
be
ample
time
to
describe
them
while
they
are
wending
their
way
through
the
damp
of
the
misty
december
morning
up
from
the
river
level
to
the
hill
country
that
stretched
beyond
lilias
was
just
sixteen
and
very
pretty
with
gray
eyes
fair
hair
a
straight
nose
and
two
bewitching
dimples
when
she
smiled
these
dimples
were
rather
misleading
for
they
gave
strangers
the
impression
that
lilias
was
humorous
which
was
entirely
a
mistake
it
was
dulcie
who
was
the
humorist
in
reality
dulcie
whose
long
lashes
dropped
over
her
shy
eyes
and
who
never
could
say
a
word
for
herself
in
public
though
in
the
society
of
intimate
friends
she
could
be
amusing
enough
dulcie
at
fourteen
seemed
years
younger
than
lilias
she
did
not
wish
to
grow
up
too
soon
and
thankfully
tipped
all
responsibilities
on
to
her
elder
sister
cousin
clare
always
said
there
were
undiscovered
depths
in
dulcie
character
but
they
were
slow
in
development
and
at
present
she
was
a
childish
little
person
with
a
pink
baby
face
an
affection
for
fairy
tales
and
even
a
sneaking
weakness
for
her
discarded
dolls
life
that
to
lilias
seemed
a
serious
business
was
a
joyous
venture
to
dulcie
she
had
a
happy
knack
of
shaking
off
the
unpleasant
things
and
throwing
the
utmost
possible
power
of
enjoyment
into
the
nice
ones
if
innocent
happiness
is
the
birthright
of
childhood
she
clung
to
it
steadfastly
and
had
not
yet
exchanged
it
for
the
red
pottage
of
worldly
wisdom
ever
since
father
and
mother
in
the
great
disaster
of
the
wreck
of
the
had
gone
down
together
into
the
gray
waters
of
the
atlantic
the
ingleton
children
had
lived
with
their
grandfather
leslie
ingleton
at
cheverley
chase
there
were
six
of
them
everard
lilias
dulcie
roland
bevis
and
clifford
and
as
time
passed
on
and
the
memory
of
that
tragedy
in
grew
faint
the
chase
seemed
as
entirely
their
home
as
if
they
had
been
born
there
in
opinion
at
any
rate
it
belonged
to
them
as
it
had
always
belonged
to
the
prospective
heirs
of
the
ingleton
family
and
that
family
could
trace
back
through
many
centuries
to
days
of
civil
wars
and
service
for
king
and
country
to
crusades
and
deeds
of
chivalry
and
even
to
ancestors
who
gave
counsel
at
saxon
witenagemots
norman
keep
had
succeeded
wooden
manor
and
that
in
its
turn
had
given
place
to
a
tudor
dwelling
and
both
had
finally
merged
into
a
long
georgian
mansion
with
straight
rows
of
windows
and
a
classic
porch
not
so
picturesque
as
the
older
buildings
but
very
convenient
and
comfortable
from
a
modern
point
of
view
the
lovely
gardens
with
their
clipped
yew
hedges
were
one
of
the
sights
of
the
neighborhood
and
it
was
a
family
satisfaction
that
the
view
from
the
terrace
over
park
wood
and
stream
showed
not
a
single
acre
of
land
that
was
not
their
own
leslie
ingleton
a
fine
type
of
the
kindly
but
autocratic
english
squire
belonged
to
a
bygone
generation
and
found
it
difficult
to
move
with
the
march
of
the
times
because
he
had
spent
his
years
of
life
on
the
soil
of
cheverley
the
people
tolerated
in
the
ould
squire
many
things
that
they
would
not
have
passed
over
in
a
younger
man
or
a
stranger
they
shrugged
their
shoulders
and
gave
way
to
his
tyranny
for
man
and
boy
everybody
on
the
estate
had
experienced
his
kindness
and
realized
his
good
intentions
towards
his
tenants
if
he
does
fly
off
at
a
tangent
ten
to
one
miss
clare
be
down
the
next
day
and
set
all
straight
again
was
the
general
verdict
on
his
frequent
outbursts
cheverley
chase
would
have
been
quite
incomplete
without
cousin
clare
she
was
a
second
cousin
of
the
ingletons
who
had
come
to
tend
grandmother
in
her
last
illness
and
after
her
death
had
remained
to
take
charge
of
the
household
and
the
family
of
grandchildren
she
was
one
of
those
calm
quiet
women
who
in
the
early
centuries
would
have
been
a
saint
and
in
mediæval
times
the
abbess
of
a
nunnery
but
happening
to
be
born
in
the
nineteenth
century
her
mental
outlook
had
a
modern
bias
and
both
her
philanthropy
and
her
religious
instincts
had
developed
along
the
latest
lines
of
thought
she
had
schemes
of
her
own
for
work
in
the
world
but
at
present
she
was
doing
the
task
that
was
nearest
in
helping
to
bring
up
the
motherless
children
who
had
been
placed
temporarily
in
her
care
to
manage
this
rather
turbulent
crew
soothe
the
irascible
old
squire
and
keep
the
general
household
in
unity
was
a
task
that
required
unusual
powers
of
tact
and
a
capacity
for
administration
and
organization
that
was
worthy
of
a
wider
sphere
she
might
be
described
as
the
axle
of
the
family
wheel
for
she
was
the
unobtrusive
center
around
which
everything
unconsciously
revolved
but
by
this
time
lilias
and
dulcie
will
have
ridden
up
hill
and
down
dale
and
will
be
turning
rajah
and
peri
in
at
the
great
gates
of
cheverley
chase
and
trotting
through
the
park
and
up
the
carriage
drive
to
the
house
there
was
quite
a
big
welcome
for
them
when
they
arrived
everard
had
returned
the
day
before
from
harrow
roland
was
back
from
his
preparatory
school
and
the
two
little
ones
bevis
and
clifford
had
just
said
for
three
weeks
to
their
nursery
governess
and
in
consequence
were
in
the
wildest
of
holiday
spirits
there
was
a
general
family
pilgrimage
round
the
premises
to
look
at
all
the
most
cherished
treasures
the
horses
the
pigeons
the
pet
rabbits
the
new
puppies
the
garden
and
the
woods
beyond
the
park
there
were
talks
with
the
grooms
and
the
keepers
and
plans
for
cutting
evergreens
and
decorating
both
the
house
and
the
village
church
in
orthodox
christmas
fashion
it
lovely
to
be
at
home
again
sighed
lilias
with
satisfaction
as
the
three
elder
ones
sauntered
back
through
the
winding
paths
of
the
terraced
vegetable
garden
and
such
a
home
too
exulted
dulcie
rather
agreed
everard
that
was
exactly
what
was
in
my
mind
the
first
thing
i
thought
when
i
looked
out
of
the
window
this
morning
was
a
ripping
place
it
is
and
some
day
it
will
be
all
mine
yours
everard
why
of
course
who
else
should
it
be
the
chase
has
always
gone
strictly
in
the
male
line
and
i
the
oldest
grandson
so
naturally
the
heir
it
goes
without
saying
dulcie
pink
face
was
looking
puzzled
do
you
mean
to
say
if
grandfather
were
to
die
that
everything
would
be
yours
she
asked
would
you
be
the
squire
i
believe
i
called
young
squire
already
replied
everard
airily
but
what
about
the
rest
of
us
objected
dulcie
oh
i
look
after
you
of
course
the
heir
always
does
something
for
the
younger
ones
you
need
be
afraid
on
that
score
everard
tone
was
magnanimous
and
patronizing
in
the
extreme
he
was
gazing
at
the
house
with
an
air
of
evident
proprietorship
dulcie
who
had
never
considered
the
question
before
revolved
it
carefully
in
her
youthful
brain
for
a
moment
or
two
then
she
ventured
a
comment
would
it
be
fairer
to
divide
it
nonsense
dulcie
put
in
lilias
you
do
understand
properties
like
this
are
never
divided
they
always
go
just
as
they
are
to
the
eldest
son
you
could
chop
them
up
into
pieces
or
there
be
no
estate
left
could
one
have
the
house
and
the
other
the
wood
and
another
the
park
much
good
the
house
would
do
anybody
without
the
estate
to
keep
it
up
grunted
everard
dulcie
you
an
utter
baby
i
do
believe
you
ever
see
farther
than
the
end
of
your
silly
little
nose
you
may
be
glad
you
got
a
brother
to
take
care
of
you
but
have
i
as
much
right
here
as
you
persisted
dulcie
obstinately
no
you
have
the
heir
always
has
the
best
right
to
everything
cheer
up
when
the
place
is
mine
i
mean
to
have
a
ripping
time
here
i
make
things
hum
i
can
tell
you
ask
my
friends
down
and
you
girls
shall
help
to
entertain
i
planned
it
all
out
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
go
to
cambridge
first
but
i
enjoy
myself
there
too
you
bet
on
the
whole
i
think
i
was
born
under
a
lucky
star
hallo
there
goes
astley
i
want
to
speak
to
him
everard
whistled
to
the
groom
and
ran
down
the
garden
leaving
his
sisters
to
return
to
the
house
at
seventeen
he
was
a
fair
handsome
dashing
sort
of
boy
of
a
type
more
common
thirty
years
ago
than
at
present
he
held
closely
to
the
ideas
of
privileges
of
birth
and
according
to
modern
notions
had
contracted
some
false
ideals
of
life
he
had
lounged
through
school
without
attempting
to
work
and
was
depending
for
all
his
future
upon
what
should
be
left
him
by
the
industry
of
others
all
the
same
in
spite
of
his
attitude
of
top
dog
in
the
family
he
was
attractive
and
inclined
to
be
generous
like
most
boys
of
seventeen
he
had
reached
the
swollen
head
stage
and
imagined
himself
of
vastly
greater
importance
than
he
really
was
the
sobriquet
of
the
young
squire

his
fancy
and
he
meant
to
live
up
to
what
he
considered
were
the
traditions
of
so

over
at

orthodox
mode
the
young
ingletons
with
plenty
of
evergreens
to
work
upon
performed
prodigies
in
the
way
of
decorations
at
church
and
home
they
distributed
presents
at
a
for
the
children
of
tenants
and
turned
up
in
a
body
to
occupy
the
front
seats
at
the
annual
new
year
concert
in
the
village
when
the
usual
festivities
were
finished
however
time
hung
a
little
heavy
on
their
hands
and
one
particular
morning
found
them
lounging
about
the
in
the
especially
aggravating
situation
of
not
quite
knowing
what
to
do
with
themselves
it
too
bad
we
ca
have
the
horses
groused
dulcie
i
set
my
heart
on
a
ride
and
i
ca
get
on
with
my
fancy
work
till
i
can
go
to
balderton
for
some
more
silks
and
i
want
some
wool
proclaimed
lilias
stopping
from
a
rather
unnecessary
onslaught
of
poking
at
the
fire
there
never
anything
fit
to
buy
at
this
wretched
little
shop
in
the
village
except
bacon
and
kippers
grinned
roland
i
ca
knit
with
kippers
fact
is
we
all
bored
stiff
drawled
everard
from
the
sofa
flinging
away
the
book
he
was
reading
and
stretching
his
arms
in
the
luxury
of
a
yawn
what
should
you
say
to
a
turn
in
the
car
would
it
be
rather
sport
do
you
think
if
grandfather
would
spare
milner
to
take
us
said
lilias
doubtfully
we
do
want
milner
drive
you
i
can
manage
a
car
as
well
as
he
can
any
day
do
get
excited
you
kids
bevis
i
shall
certainly
allow
you
to
try
to
drive
there
only
going
to
be
one
man
at
that
job
and
that
myself
shall
we
go
and
ask
grandfather
suggested
dulcie
right
you
are
no
not
the
whole
of
us
as
there
was
a
general
family
move
three
enough
so
a
deputation
consisting
of
everard
lilias
and
dulcie
promptly
presented
themselves
at
the
study
door
and
tapped
for
admission
as
there
was
no
reply
to
a
second
rap
they
opened
the
door
and
walked
into
the
room
grandfather
was
rather
deaf
and
sometimes
when
he
had
ignored
a
summons
he
would
say
well
why
did
you
come
in
he
was
generally
to
be
found
writing
letters
at
this
hour
in
the
morning
but
the
revolving
chair
was
empty
he
had
apparently
begun
his
usual
correspondence
for
his
desk
was
littered
with
papers
leaning
up
against
the
there
was
a
photograph
the
young
people
who
had
walked
across
the
room
towards
the
window
could
not
fail
to
notice
it
for
it
was
tilted
in
such
a
prominent
place
that
it
at
once
attracted
their
attention
it
represented
a
very
pretty
young
lady
holding
a
baby
on
her
lap
with
a
slight
background
of
greek
columns
the
decidedly
foreign
look
about
it
was
justified
by
the
name
in
the
corner
carlo
salviati
palermo
over
the
top
was
written
in
ink
in
a
man
handwriting
my
wife
and
leslie
from
tristram
who
is
it
asked
everard
gazing
at
the
portrait
with
curiosity
she
rather
decent
looking
never
seen
her
here
though
that
i
can
remember
it
a
ducky
little
baby
but
who
is
tristram
said
dulcie
we
had
an
uncle
tristram
once
answered
lilias
doubtfully
why
but
he
died
years
and
years
ago
when
we
were
all
kids
returned
everard
i
know
he
was
the
only
tristram
in
the
family
though
i
imagine
who
these
two
can
be
leslie
too
why
that
name
was
the
baby
christened
after
him
we
ask
cousin
clare
sometime
said
dulcie
so
interested
that
she
could
scarcely
tear
herself
away
i
really
want
to
know
most
fearfully
who
they
are
oh
do
bother
about
photos
at
present
let
find
grandfather
urged
everard
perhaps
he
gone
down
to
the
stables
or
he
may
be
in
the
on
further
inquiry
however
they
ascertained
that
a
telegram
had
arrived
for
ingleton
on
the
receipt
of
which
he
had
consulted
miss
clare
had
ordered
the
smaller
car
and
they
had
both
been
driven
away
by
milner
the
chauffeur
and
were
not
expected
back
until
seven
or
eight
in
the
evening
this
was
news
indeed
for
a
whole
day
the
heads
of
the
establishment
would
be
absent
and
the
younger
generation
had
the
place
to
themselves
for
the
next
eight
hours
they
could
do
practically
as
they
pleased
everard
stood
for
a
moment
thinking
he
did
not
reveal
quite
all
that
passed
through
his
mind
but
the
first
instalment
was
sufficient
for
the
family
we
get
out
the
touring
car
take
some
lunch
with
us
and
have
a
five
delighted
faces
smiled
their
appreciation
oh
everard
dare
we
dulcie
objection
was
consciously
faint
why
not
when
grandfather
away
i
consider
i
a
right
to
take
his
place
and
use
the
car
if
i
want
i
master
here
in
his
absence
make
it
all
right
with
him
do
you
girls
alarm
yourselves
tear
off
and
put
on
your
coats
and
tell
atkins
to
pack
us
a
basket
of
lunch
and
to
put
some
coffee
in
the
thermos
flasks
with
everard
willing
to
assume
the
full
responsibility
the
girls
could
not
resist
such
a
tempting
offer
while
the
younger
boys
were
of
course
only
too
ready
to
follow
where
their
elders
led
elton
the
groom
made
some
slight
demur
when
everard
went
down
to
the
and
began
to
get
out
the
big
but
the
boy
behaved
with
such
assurance
that
he
concluded
he
must
be
acting
with
his
permission
moreover
elton
was
in
charge
of
the
horses
and
not
the
cars
and
milner
the
chauffeur
who
might
reasonably
have
raised
objections
was
away
driving
his
master
the
cook
who
perhaps
considered
it
was
no
business
of
hers
to
offer
remonstrances
and
that
the
house
would
be
quieter
without
the
young
folks
hastily
packed
a
picnic
hamper
and
filled
the
thermos
flasks
a
rejoicing
crew
carried
them
outside
and
stowed
them
in
the
car
it
seemed
a
delightful
adventure
to
go
off
in
this
way
entirely
on
their
own
there
was
some
slight
wrangling
over
seats
but
everard
settled
it
in
his
lofty
fashion
you
sit
where
i
tell
you
i
have
lilias
in
front
and
the
rest
of
you
may
pack
in
behind
if
you
do
like
it
you
can
stop
at
home
no
i
not
going
to
have
you
kids
interfering
here
so
you
need
think
it
everard
had
been
taught
by
the
chauffeur
to
drive
and
could
manage
a
car
quite
tolerably
well
he
possessed
any
amount
of
confidence
which
is
a
good
or
bad
quality
according
to
circumstances
he
ran
the
large
touring
daimler
successfully
through
the
park
and
turned
her
out
at
the
great
iron
gateway
on
to
the
highroad
everybody
was
in
the
keenest
spirits
it
was
a
lovely
day
wonderfully
mild
for
january
and
the
sunshine
was
so
pleasant
that
they
hardly
needed
the
thick
fur
rugs
there
seemed
a
hint
of
spring
in
the
air
already
hazel
catkins
hung
here
and
there
in
the
hedgerows
thrushes
and
robins
were
singing
cheerily
and
wayside
cottages
were
covered
with
the
blossom
of
the
yellow
jessamine
it
was
a
joy
to
spin
along
the
good
smooth
highroad
in
the
luxurious
car
everard
was
a
quick
driver
and
kept
a
pace
which
sometimes
exceeded
the
speed
limit
fortunately
his
brothers
and
sisters
were
not
nervous
or
they
might
have
held
their
breath
as
he
dashed
round
corners
without
sounding
his
horn
pelted
down
hills
and
on
several
occasions
narrowly
avoided
colliding
with
farm
carts
a
reckless
boy
of
seventeen
without
much
previous
experience
does
not
make
the
most
careful
of
motorists
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
the
first
time
master
everard
had
driven
without
the
chauffeur
at
his
elbow
and
though
he
got
on
very
well
his
performance
was
not
unattended
with
risks
towards
one
the
crew
at
the
back
began
to
clamor
for
lunch
and
to
suggest
a
halt
when
some
suitable
spot
should
be
reached
the
difficulty
was
to
find
a
place
for
they
were
driving
so
fast
that
by
the
time
the
younger
boys
had
called
out
the
possibilities
of
some
wood
or
small
quarry
the
car
had
flown
past
and
sooner
than
turn
back
everard
would
say
oh
we
stop
somewhere
else
by
unanimous
urging
however
he
was
at
last
persuaded
to
halt
at
a
picturesque
little
bridge
in
a
sheltered
hollow
where
they
had
the
benefit
of
the
sunshine
and
escaped
the
wind
a
small
brook
wandered
below
between
green
banks
where
autumn
brambles
still
showed
brown
leaves
and
actually
a
shriveled
blackberry
or
two
remained
there
was
a
patch
of
grass
by
the
roadside
and
here
everard
put
the
car
to
be
out
of
reach
of
passing
traffic
while
its
occupants
spread
the
rugs
on
the
low
wall
of
the
bridge
and
began
to
unpack
their
picnic
baskets
cook
had
certainly
done
her
best
for
them
there
were
ham
sandwiches
and
pieces
of
cold
pie
and
jam
turnovers
and
slices
of
cake
and
some
apples
and
oranges
and
plenty
of
hot
coffee
in
the
thermos
flasks
it
ever
so
much
nicer
to
have
one
meals
even
in
january
declared
bevis
munching
a
damson
tartlet
and
dropping
stones
into
the
brook
below
i
believe
it
warm
enough
to
wade
that
water
does
look
cold
somehow
no
you
do
said
lilias
briskly
you
need
think
just
because
miss
mason
is
here
you
can
do
all
the
mad
things
you
like
it
no
use
beginning
to
unlace
your
boots
for
i
sha
let
you
wade
or
clifford
either
the
idea
in
january
why
not
sulked
bevis
i
did
ask
lilias
everard
wo
say
no
you
can
please
yourselves
answered
his
eldest
brother
but
going
to
take
the
car
on
now
if
you
stay
and
wade
you
have
to
walk
home
that
all
i
certainly
sha
came
back
for
you
at
so
awful
a
threat
the
youngsters
who
had
really
meant
business
where
the
water
was
concerned
hurriedly
relaced
their
boots
and
ran
to
take
their
places
in
the
car
the
girls
finished
packing
the
remains
of
the
picnic
in
the
basket
and
followed
and
soon
the
engine
was
started
again
and
they
were
once
more
flying
along
the
road
everard
had
brought
out
the
family
for
a
without
any
very
particular
idea
of
where
they
were
going
though
he
was
steering
generally
in
the
direction
of
the
cleland
hills
to
his
mind
the
chief
fun
of
the
expedition
lay
in
simply
taking
any
road
that
looked
interesting
without
regard
to
the
others
trusted
implicitly
to
his
powers
of
and
had
really
not
the
slightest
idea
in
what
part
of
the
country
they
were
traveling
after
quite
a
long
time
however
it
occurred
to
lilias
to
ask
where
they
were
and
how
long
it
would
take
them
to
get
home
again
we
come
such
a
roundabout
route
i
scarcely
know
replied
everard
those
are
the
cleland
hills
in
front
of
us
though
and
if
we
bowl
straight
ahead
and
go
over
them
we
shall
get
to
clacton
bridge
then
we
can
get
the
straight
highroad
back
to
cheverley
we
sha
be
home
before
it
dark
though
well
no
but
the
head
lights
are
working
all
right
i
tried
them
before
we
started
it
will
be
fun
to
drive
in
the
dark
chuckled
the
boys
behind
i
hope
we
shall
be
back
before
grandfather
and
cousin
clare
though
said
dulcie
a
little
uneasily
the
road
over
the
cleland
hills
was
much
wilder
than
they
expected
and
it
was
very
stony
and
bad
up
and
up
they
went
till
walls
hedges
and
farms
had
disappeared
and
only
the
lonely
moor
lay
on
either
side
of
the
rough
track
it
was
a
place
where
no
motorist
in
his
senses
would
have
ventured
to
take
a
car
the
extreme
roughness
of
the
road
made
steering
difficult
and
the
strain
on
the
tires
was
enormous
instead
of
driving
cautiously
everard
plunged
along
with
all
the
hardihood
of
youth
bumping
anyhow
over
ruts
and
stones
they
were
just
beyond
the
brow
of
the
hill
when
a
loud
bang
followed
by
a
grinding
sensation
announced
the
bad
news
that
one
of
their
tires
had
burst
what
beastly
bad
luck
lamented
everard
getting
out
to
inspect
the
injured
cover
it
might
have
had
the
decency
to
keep
up
till
we
had
reached
civilization
well
there
nothing
for
it
but
to
put
on
the
spare
tire
i
helped
milner
to
do
it
before
so
i
can
manage
it
a
bother
we
left
the
spare
wheel
at
home
i
shall
want
some
of
you
to
help
me
though
everard
had
indeed
rendered
some
assistance
to
the
chauffeur
on
various
occasions
but
it
was
quite
another
matter
to
perform
the
troublesome
operation
of
changing
the
tire
with
only
two
girls
and
three
young
brothers
to
lend
a
hand
in
their
inexperienced
enthusiasm
they
did
all
the
wrong
things
very
nearly
nipped
the
tube
mislaid
the
tools
and
pulled
where
they
should
have
pushed
it
was
only
after
nearly
an
work
that
everard
at
last
managed
to
get
the
business
finished
the
family
warm
and
excited
packed
once
more
into
the
car
well
i
hope
we
shall
have
no
more
troubles
now
exclaimed
lilias
who
was
growing
tired
and
longing
for
home
and
tea
what
the
matter
everard
matter
why
she
wo
start
that
all
here
was
a
predicament
whether
the
bumping
up
the
rough
road
had
thrown
some
delicate
piece
of
mechanism
out
of
gear
or
the
waiting
in
the
cold
had
cooled
the
engine
it
was
impossible
to
say
but
nothing
that
everard
could
do
would
induce
the
car
to
start
he
examined
everything
which
his
rather
limited
knowledge
of
motorology
suggested
might
be
the
cause
of
the
stoppage
but
with
no
result
after
half
an
tinkering
he
was
obliged
ruefully
to
acknowledge
himself
utterly
baffled
they
were
indeed
in
an
extremely
awkward
situation
stranded
on
a
wild
moor
probably
sixty
miles
from
home
and
with
the
short
winter
day
closing
rapidly
in
what
we
to
do
gasped
lilias
we
ca
stay
here
all
night
finish
our
prog
and
sleep
in
the
car
suggested
roland
no
no
we
should
be
frozen
before
morning
i
think
we
better
walk
on
while
it
light
enough
to
see
said
everard
we
shall
probably
strike
a
highroad
soon
and
we
stop
some
motorist
ask
for
a
lift
to
the
nearest
town
and
stay
all
night
at
a
hotel
but
what
about
the
car
we
must
just
leave
her
to
her
fate
there
nothing
else
for
it
i
do
suppose
anybody
will
touch
her
up
here
it
ca
be
helped
any
way
let
finish
our
prog
before
we
set
off
persisted
roland
opening
the
picnic
basket
the
family
was
hungry
again
so
they
readily
set
to
work
to
dispose
of
the
remains
of
their
lunch
it
might
be
a
long
time
before
they
were
within
reach
of
their
next
meal
and
they
blessed
cook
for
having
packed
a
plentiful
supply
everard
would
not
let
them
linger
for
more
than
a
few
minutes
hurry
up
you
kids
he
urged
we
do
know
how
far
we
may
have
to
go
and
it
will
be
getting
dark
soon
thank
goodness
we
shall
be
walking
down
hill
at
any
rate
illustration
what
we
to
do
gasped
lilias
after
whisking
along
in
the
car
shanks
pony
seemed
a
very
slow
mode
of
progress
their
breakdown
had
happened
in
an
spot
and
it
was
more
than
an
hour
before
they
reached
a
highroad
it
was
almost
dark
by
that
time
and
matters
seemed
so
desperate
that
everard
determined
to
hail
the
very
first
passing
motorist
who
seemed
to
be
able
to
help
them
fate
brought
along
no
handsome
tourist
car
but
a
rattling
the
driver
of
which
stopped
in
answer
to
their
united
shouts
and
after
hearing
of
the
difficulty
they
were
in
consented
to
give
them
a
lift
to
the
town
five
miles
away
for
which
he
was
bound
fortunately
the
lorry
was
empty
so
the
family
thankfully
climbed
in
and
squatted
on
the
floor
while
everard
sat
in
front
with
the
driver
it
was
not
a
very
aristocratic
mode
of
conveyance
for
the
heir
of
cheverley
chase
but
everard
was
in
no
mood
to
pick
and
choose
just
then
and
would
have
accepted
a
seat
in
a
coal
truck
if
necessary
as
for
the
younger
ones
they
enjoyed
the
fun
of
it
it
was
a
very
bumpy
performance
to
sit
on
the
floor
of
the
jolting
wagon
but
at
any
rate
infinitely
preferable
to
walking
arrived
in
bilstone
their
cicerone
drove
them
to
a
commercial
hotel
with
whose
landlady
he
had
some
acquaintance
and
that
good
dame
after
eyeing
the
party
curiously
consented
to
make
up
beds
for
them
for
the
night
i
no
private
to
put
you
in
and
i
ca
show
these
young
ladies
into
the
commercial
room
she
objected
but
i
have
a
fire
lighted
in
one
of
the
bedrooms
and
you
can
all
have
some
tea
up
there
will
that
suit
you
lilias
and
dulcie
catching
a
glimpse
through
an
open
door
of
the
company
smoking
in
the
commercial
room
agreed
thankfully
glad
to
find
some
safe
haven
to
which
they
could
beat
a
retreat
i
wonder
what
cousin
clare
would
say
they
asked
each
other
it
was
indeed
an
urgent
matter
to
send
some
news
of
their
whereabouts
to
cheverley
chase
where
their
absence
must
be
causing
much
alarm
while
the
landlady
therefore
ordered
the
tea
everard
went
out
to
the
public
telephone
asked
for
a
trunk
call
and
rang
up
no
balderton
he
could
hear
relief
in
the
voice
of
old
winder
who
answered
the
telephone
everard
was
not
anxious
to
enter
into
too
many
explanations
so
he
simply
said
that
they
had
had
a
breakdown
told
the
name
of
the
town
and
the
hotel
where
they
were
staying
and
suggested
that
milner
should
come
over
next
morning
to
the
rescue
on
hearing
his
grandfather
voice
he
promptly
rang
off
would
be
quite
time
enough
so
he
felt
for
giving
the
history
of
their
adventure
the
unpleasant
interview
might
just
as
well
be
deferred
and
he
had
no
wish
to
listen
to
explosions
of
anger
over
the
telephone
tea
tinned
salmon
plum
and
apple
jam
and
very
indifferent
bedrooms
were
the
best
that
the
commercial
hotel
had
to
offer
but
it
was
infinitely
better
than
being
benighted
on
the
moor
in
spite
of
lack
of
all
toilet
necessaries
the
ingletons
slept
peacefully
worn
out
with
their
long
day
in
the
fresh
air
milner
the
chauffeur
must
have
made
an
early
start
for
he
arrived
at
eleven
next
morning
in
the
small
car
armed
with
his
master
instructions
he
paid
the
hotel
bill
chartered
a
taxi
in
which
he
dispatched
lilias
dulcie
roland
bevis
and
clifford
straight
for
home
then
engaging
a
mechanic
from
a
garage
and
taking
everard
as
guide
he
started
up
the
hill
in
the
pouring
rain
to
find
the
abandoned
car
it
needed
several
attention
before
it
could
be
induced
to
start
and
it
was
not
until
evening
that
he
was
able
to
place
it
safely
back
in
the
at
cheverley
chase
everard
had
expected
his
peppery
grandfather
to
be
angry
but
he
was
quite
unprepared
for
the
intensity
of
the
storm
which
burst
over
his
head
on
his
return
your
insolence
goes
beyond
all
bounds
thundered
ingleton
to
borrow
my
car
without
leave
and
to
take
your
sisters
without
a
chaperon
to
a
you
deserve
horsewhipping
for
it
you
think
yourself
the
young
squire
do
you
and
imagine
you
can
do
just
what
you
like
here
while
i
above
ground
i
have
you
to
know
master
and
nobody
else
in
this
place
i
ca
see
it
was
anything
so
out
of
the
way
to
take
the
kids
a
run
in
the
car
and
i
never
meant
to
keep
the
girls
out
all
night
replied
everard
defiantly
he
had
a
temper
as
well
as
his
grandfather
and
the
pair
had
often
been
at
loggerheads
before
indeed
there
are
ways
of
making
people
see
you
can
just
go
a
little
too
far
sometimes
declared
the
old
gentleman
sarcastically
given
orders
that
you
do
take
either
car
out
again
unless
milner
is
with
you
so
you
understand
i
suppose
i
do
grunted
everard
turning
sulkily
away
it
was
only
a
few
days
after
this
that
everard
lilias
and
dulcie
returning
home
across
the
park
from
a
walk
in
the
woods
met
bowden
the
family
solicitor
who
was
riding
down
the
drive
from
the
chase
he
stopped
his
and
got
off
to
speak
to
them
they
knew
him
well
for
he
often
came
to
the
house
to
conduct
their
business
and
he
was
indeed
quite
a
favorite
with
them
all
he
looked
at
everard
keenly
when
the
first
greetings
were
over
been
getting
yourself
into
considerable
hot
water
just
lately
you
he
remarked
everard
colored
and
frowned
then
burst
forth
grandfather
quite
too
ridiculous
why
should
i
take
out
the
car
if
i
want
to
i
can
drive
as
well
as
milner
he
behaved
as
if
i
were
a
kid
it
more
than
a
fellow
can
stand
sometimes
he
likes
to
keep
everything
tight
in
his
own
hands
at
his
age
it
time
he
began
to
stand
aside
a
little
and
let
look
after
things
i
shall
have
to
take
charge
of
the
whole
property
some
day
i
suppose
bowden
was
gazing
at
everard
with
the
noncommittal
air
often
assumed
by
lawyers
i
would
make
too
sure
about
that
he
said
slowly
i
suppose
you
know
your
uncle
tristram
left
a
child
no
well
he
did
at
any
rate
i
must
hurry
on
now
i
an
appointment
to
keep
at
my
office
a
happy
new
year
to
you
all
and
starting
his
engine
he
was
off
before
they
had
time
to
reply
what
does
he
mean
asked
lilias
watching
the
retreating
bicycle
uncle
tristram
has
been
dead
for
thirteen
years
we
never
seem
to
have
heard
anything
about
him
what
was
that
photo
we
saw
on
the
study
table
queried
dulcie
you
remember
the
lady
and
the
baby
and
it
had
written
on
it
wife
and
leslie
from
tristram
i
suppose
it
was
uncle
tristram
wife
and
child
replied
everard
thoughtfully
he
must
have
called
the
kid
after
grandfather
they
ought
to
have
christened
i
ca
think
why
they
did
have
we
a
cousin
leslie
then
whom
we
do
know
i
suppose
we
must
have
somewhere
how
fearfully
thrilling
um
i
do
know
that
it
thrilling
at
all
it
the
first
i
heard
of
it
until
i
wish
our
father
had
been
the
eldest
son
instead
of
uncle
tristram
why
what
does
it
matter
it
may
matter
more
than
you
think
you
a
silly
little
goose
dulcie
and
as
i
often
tell
you
you
never
see
farther
than
the
end
of
your
own
nose
surely
after
all
these
years
though
grandfather
must
what
asked
lilias
curiously
never
you
mind
girls
ca
know
everything
snapped
everard
walking
on
in
front
of
his
sisters
with
a
look
of
unwonted
worry
upon
his
usually
careless
and
handsome
young
face
chapter
iii
a
valentine
party
chilcombe
hall
where
lilias
and
dulcie
had
been
boarders
for
the
last
two
years
was
an
exceedingly
nice
school
it
stood
on
a
well
raised
above
the
river
and
behind
it
there
was
a
little
wood
where
bulbs
had
been
naturalized
and
where
in
their
season
you
might
find
clumps
of
pure
white
snowdrops
sheets
of
glorious
daffodils
and
later
on
lovely
masses
of
the
lily
of
the
valley
in
the
garden
all
kinds
of
sweet
things
seemed
to
be
blooming
the
whole
year
round
golden
aconite
buds
opened
with
the
january
term
and
in
a
wild
patch
above
the
rockery
the
delicious
blossomed
to
tempt
the
bees
which
an
hour
sunshine
would
bring
forth
from
the
hives
scarlet
was
trained
along
the
wall
under
the
front
windows
and
early
flowering
cherry
and
almond
blossoms
made
delicate
pink
patches
of
color
long
before
leaves
were
showing
on
the
trees
beautiful
surroundings
in
a
school
can
be
quite
as
important
a
part
of
our
education
as
the
textbooks
through
which
we
toil
we
are
made
up
of
body
mind
and
spirit
and
the
developing
soul
needs
satisfying
as
much
as
the
physical
or
mental
part
of
us
long
years
afterwards
though
we
utterly
forget
the
lessons
we
may
have
learnt
as
children
we
can
still
vividly
recall
the
effect
of
the
afternoon
sun
streaming
through
the
fuchsia
bush
outside
the
open
french
window
where
we
sat
conning
those
unremembered
tasks
the
lovely
things
of
nature
assimilated
half
unconsciously
when
we
are
young
equip
us
with
a
purity
of
heart
and
a
refinement
of
taste
that
should
safeguard
us
later
and
keep
our
thoughts
at
a
lofty
level
the
beauty
cult
was
a
decided
feature
of
chilcombe
hall
miss
walters
was
extremely
artistic
she
painted
well
in
and
had
exquisite
taste
many
of
the
charming
decorations
in
the
house
had
been
done
by
herself
she
had
designed
and
stencilled
the
frieze
of
drooping
clusters
of
wistaria
that
decorated
the
wall
the
framed
landscapes
in
the
were
her
own
work
and
she
herself
always
superintended
the
arrangement
of
the
bowls
of
flowers
that
gave
such
brightness
to
the
schoolrooms
her
twenty
pupils
had
on
the
whole
a
decidedly
pleasant
time
there
were
just
enough
of
them
to
develop
the
community
spirit
but
not
too
many
to
obliterate
the
individual
or
as
ida
spenser
put
it
you
can
get
up
a
play
or
a
dance
or
any
other
sort
of
fun
and
yet
we
all
know
each
other
like
a
kind
of
big
family
divided
up
into
small
families
according
to
bedrooms
added
hester
wilson
the
bedrooms
at
chilcombe
hall
were
rather
a
speciality
they
were
large
and
were
furnished
partly
as
studies
and
girls
had
their
own
bookcases
and
pretty
things
there
as
the
house
was
provided
with
central
heating
they
were
warmed
and
a
certain
amount
of
preparation
was
done
in
them
each
afternoon
miss
walters
artistic
faculty
had
decorated
them
in
schemes
of
various
colors
so
that
they
were
known
respectively
as
the
rose
the
gold
the
green
the
brown
and
the
blue
bedrooms
lilias
and
dulcie
ingleton
gowan
barbour
and
bertha
chesters
who
occupied
the
considered
it
quite
the
choicest
of
all
they
had
each
made
important
contributions
to
its
furniture
had
clubbed
together
to
buy
a
liberty
had
provided
vases
in
lovely
shades
of
turquoise
blue
and
had
worked
nightdress
cases
and
other
accessories
to
accord
with
the
prevailing
tone
the
blue
grotto
as
they
named
their
dormitory
certainly
had
points
over
rival
bedrooms
for
it
looked
down
the
garden
towards
the
river
and
had
the
best
view
of
the
sunset
moreover
it
was
at
the
very
end
of
the
corridor
so
that
sudden
outbursts
of
laughter
did
not
meet
the
ears
of
miss
hardy
quite
so
easily
as
from
the
rose
or
the
brown
room
the
work
of
the
spring
term
had
been
in
full
swing
for
nearly
a
month
when
gowan
barbour
looking
at
the
calendar
with
blue
cranesbill
geraniums
suddenly
discovered
that
next
morning
would
be
the
festival
of
valentine
could
anything
be
better
she
exulted
we
won
the
record
for
tidiness
three
weeks
running
so
we
entitled
to
a
special
indulgence
i
vote
we
ask
to
bring
tea
up
here
and
have
a
valentine
party
you
think
it
would
be
rather
scrumptious
i
all
sorts
of
ideas
in
my
head
topping
agreed
dulcie
pausing
in
the
act
of
tying
her
hair
ribbon
to
consider
the
important
question
specially
if
we
could
get
miss
walters
to
let
us
send
to
glazebrook
for
a
few
cakes
i
believe
she
would
if
we
wheedled
what
about
visitors
asked
lilias
it
would
be
much
more
of
a
party
if
we
had
a
few
of
the
others
in
we
do
want
a
crowd
or
we
might
as
well
be
in
the
objected
bertha
well
of
course
we
should
ask
the
whole
school
naturally
but
perhaps
just
noreen
and
phillida
we
must
get
at
the
soft
spot
in
miss
walters
heart
decided
gowan
pick
a
bunch
of
early
violets
if
you
can
find
them
lay
them
on
her
study
table
talk
about
flowers
and
nature
for
a
little
while
then
ask
if
we
may
have
a
quiet
little
party
in
our
bedroom
afternoon
with
cakes
at
our
own
expense
quiet
queried
lilias
well
of
course
you
could
call
it
rowdy
could
you
we
send
you
to
do
the
asking
those
dimples
of
yours
generally
get
what
you
want
and
on
the
whole
i
think
you
the
pattern
one
of
us
and
the
most
likely
to
be
listened
to
tea
at
chilcombe
hall
was
a
quite
informal
meal
it
partook
indeed
more
of
the
nature
of
a
canteen
the
urns
were
what
the
girls
called
on
tap
from
four
to
and
during
summer
any
one
might
take
cup
saucer
and
plate
into
the
garden
provided
she
duly
brought
them
back
afterwards
to
the
special
permission
for
a
bedroom
feast
was
therefore
not
very
difficult
to
obtain
and
lilias
returned
from
her
interview
in
the
study
with
her
dimples
conspicuously
in
evidence
well
asked
the
interested
circle
in
the
blue
bedroom
sweet
as
honey
reported
lilias
she
said
my
dear
we
may
each
ask
one
friend
and
we
may
spend
two
shillings
amongst
us
on
cakes
if
we
give
the
money
and
the
list
of
what
we
want
to
jones
this
afternoon

said
shillings
most
emphatically

stuck
out
for
more
those
iced
cakes

always
half
a
crown
i
did
dare
to
stick
out
for
anything
i
was
so
afraid
she
change
her
mind
and
say
good
plain
cake
with
your
schoolroom
tea
and
you
must
be
content
with
that
like
she
did
to
nona
and
muriel
we
could
get
twelve
twopenny
cakes

two
shillings

dulcie
but

and

half
apiece

twopenny
iced

and
paper
to

important

iced
cakes
they
are
so
much
the
nicest

wo

much
of
a
beano
on
two
shillings
still
they
be
keen
on
coming
i
expect
noreen
phillida
prissie
and
edith
the
four
finally
selected
favorites
accepted
the
invitation
with
alacrity
bedroom
were
indulgences
only
given
to
winners
of
three
weeks
dormitory
records
so
the
less
fortunate
occupants
of
the
brown
and
rose
rooms
were
really
profiting
by
the
tidiness
of
their
hostesses
the
blue
grotto
was
placed
in
order
on
the
afternoon
of
the
fourteenth
of
february
a
white
hemstitched
cloth
and
a
bowl
of
snowdrops
adorned
the
center
table
and
the
cakes
were
set
out
on
paper
doilies
both
hostesses
and
guests
were
in
the
by
four
awaiting
the
appearance
of
the
urns
and
each
bore
her
cup
of
tea
and
a
portion
of
bread
and
butter
and
scones
upstairs
with
her
it
was
a
jolly
party
round
the
square
table
and
if
the
cakes
were
not
too
plentiful
they
were
at
least
voted
delicious
the
girls
carried
down
the
cups
when
they
had
finished
shook
the
out
of
the
window
carefully
collected
crumbs
from
the
floor
so
as
to
preserve
their
record
for
neatness
then
gathered
round
the
table
again
for
an
hour
fun
before
the
bell
should
ring
for
prep
it
a
valentine
party
and
i
got
a
ripping
idea
said
gowan
we
put
our
names
on
pieces
of
paper
fold
them
up
shuffle
them
and
draw
them
then
each
of
us
must
write
a
valentine
to
the
one
drawn
we
shuffle
these
and
one
of
us
must
read
them
all
out
then
we
must
each
guess
who
written
our
valentines
sounds
rather
brainy
does
it
objected
noreen
i
do
think
any
hand
at
poetry
oh
you
can
make
up
something
if
you
try
valentines
are
generally
doggerel
need
it
be
quite
original
asked
edith
well
if
you
really
compose
anything
we
allow
quotations
cracker
mottoes
suggested
dulcie
exactly
they
just
about
in
the
right
style
are
you
all
getting
into
a
sentimental
vein
giggled
bertha
remember
rhymes
with
and
cupid
with
with
stupid
supplied
dulcie
laconically
i
not
going
to
give
my
rhymes
away
beforehand
said
phillida
is
that
shuffling
business
finished
gowan
then
bags
me
first
draw
each
girl
having
been
apportioned
the
name
of
her
valentine
set
to
work
to
compose
a
suitable
ode
in
her
honor
there
was
much
knitting
of
brows
and
nibbling
of
pencils
and
demands
for
a
few
minutes
longer
when
gowan
called
time
at
last
however
the
effusions
were
all
finished
folded
shuffled
and
laid
in
a
pile
gowan
as
the
originator
of
the
game
was
unanimously
elected
president
she
drew
one
at
a
venture
opened
it
and
read
to
phillida
fair
maiden
who
in
ancient
song
was
wont
to
flout
her
swain
i
prithee
be
not
always
coy
but
turn
your
face
again
my
heart
is
true
and
it
will
rue
that
ever
you
should
doubt
me
so
sweet
be
kind
and
change
your
mind
and
do
for
ever
flout
me
who
wrote
that
asked
phillida
glancing
keenly
round
the
circle
noreen
i
believe
you
looking
conscious
i
always
suspect
people
who
say
they
ca
write
no
indeed
declared
noreen
you
may
make
guesses
but
nobody
to
confess
or
deny
authorship
till
the
end
put
in
gowan
hastily
remember
valentines
are
always
supposed
to
be
anonymous
now
i
going
to
read
another
to
lilias
cupid
with
his
fatal
dart
shot
me
through
and
made
me
smart
so
i
pray
before
we
part
kiss
me
once
and
heal
my
heart
short
and
sweet
commented
edith
very
sweet
quite
sugary
in
fact
agreed
lilias
it
the
sort
of
motto
you
get
out
of
a
superior
cracker
with
gelatine
paper
on
the
outside
and
trinkets
inside
there
ought
to
be
a
ring
with
all
that
i
believe
it
prissie
but
i
not
sure
it
is
by
bertha
you
may
have
two
guesses
reminded
gowan
reaching
for
another
paper
hallo
this
actually
to
me
i
feel
quite
shy
go
on
you
not
usually
afflicted
with
shyness
urged
the
others
to
gowan
wee
modest
flower
met
me
in
an
evil
hour
for
i
maun
gang
far
frae
thy
bower
and
leave
thee
greeting
the
stour
but
lassie
thou
art
no
thy
lane
this
heart
is
also
brak
in
twain
and
like
to
burst
with
grief
and
pain
to
think
i
see
thee
again
h
he
might
have
signed
burns
at
the
end
of
it
commented
gowan
seems
to
take
it
for
granted
i
doing
half
of
the
grieving
no
thanks
i
prefer
to
them
like
phillida
he
may
go
away
with
his
old
broken
heart
if
he
likes
that
not
my
idea
of
a
valentine
there
were
bad
valentines
as
well
as
good
ones
were
there
twinkled
dulcie
certainly
and
if
i
set
this
down
to
you
perhaps
i
not
be
far
out
who
comes
next
oh
bertha
to
bertha
i
have
a
little
heart
to
let
as
nice
as
nice
can
be
it
vacant
just
at
present
on
a
yearly
tenancy
it
quite
completely
furnished
with
affection
choicest
store
sweet
nothings
by
the
bushel
and
kisses
by
the
score
it
sadly
wants
a
tenant
this
little
heart
of
mine
so
i
beg
that
you
will
take
it
and
be
my
valentine
edith
dulcie
phillida
oh
i
ca
guess
laughed
bertha
not
the
least
clue
go
on
gowan
i
plump
for
phillida
the
next
on
the
list
was
to
noreen
cupid
on
his
rosy
wing
flits
to
offer
you
a
ring
take
it
dear
and
happy
make
one
who
die
for
your
sweet
sake

the
sugary
type
again
and
suggests
a
cracker
decided
noreen
you
feel
there
ought
to
be
a
big
dish
of
trifle
somewhere
near
i
wish
there
were
chirped
edith
you
have
guessed
yet
oh
well
i
guess
you
i
hope
it
my
turn
next
said
prissie
no
it
happens
to
be
dulcie
retorted
gowan
you
probably
be
the
last
of
all
to
dulcie
oh
lady
fair
from
cheverley
chase
the
day
when
first
i
saw
your
face
put
me
in
such
a
fearful
flutter
i
could
do
naught
but
moan
and
mutter
whether
i
standing
on
my
head
or
if
i
on
my
heels
instead
i
scarce
can
tell
for
cupid
arrows
have
made
my
brain
like
any
sparrow
when
you
come
near
my
foolish
heart
goes
with
throb
and
start
and
when
i
try
my
love
to
utter
my
fairest
speech
is
but
a
stutter
how
to
propose
is
all
my
task
whether
to
write
or
just
to
ask
and
ere
i
solve
the
problem
knotty
i
really
fear
i
shall
go
dotty
oh
lady
fair
in
pity
stop
and
list
while
i
the
question
pop
is
here
on
paper
think
it
over
and
let
me
be
your
humble
lover
quite
the
longest
of
them
all
smiled
dulcie
complacently
but
not
as
poetical
as
mine
contended
noreen
oh
go
on

so
she
was
to
edith
maiden
of

for
the
offender
who
wrote
such
stuff
there
do
get
excited
child
soothed
gowan
of
the
swan
neck
was
a
historical
character
do
you
remember
she
ought
to
have
married
king
harold
only
she
did
somehow
it
meant
as
a
compliment
no
doubt
i
believe
you
wrote
it
yourself

i
did
at
least
i
must
tell
just
yet
i
going
to

am
not
sentimental
please
i
can
not

until
another
time
but
if
i
lacking
in

my
heart

true
and
in
its
own
prosaic
way
it
only
beats
for
you
damsels

i
think
you
are
the
nicest
little
missie
and
beg
to
have
for

that
sweetest
maid

cried
prissie

i
do
believe

horribly
wrong
said
gowan
only
about
one
of
you
was
right
shall
i
read
the
list
to
phillida
by
dulcie
to

so
you
wrote
your
own
gowan
what
a
humbug
you
are
you
quite
put
us
off
the
scent
well
i
drew
my
own
name
you
see
i
had
to
write
something
bertha
ought
to
have
a
prize
for
guessing
right
only
we
nothing
to
give
her
shall
we
play
something
else
prissie
brought
a
pack
of
cards
and
she
says
she
tell
our
fortunes
proclaimed
edith
i
learnt
how
in
the
holidays
confessed
prissie
a
girl
was
staying
with
us
who
had
a
book
about
it
we
used
to
have
ripping
fun
every
evening
over
it
whose
fortune
shall
i
tell
first
oh
do
all
speak
at
once
look
here
you
better
each
cut
and
the
lowest
shall
win
dulcie
who
turned
up
an
ace
was
the
lucky
one
and
was
therefore
elected
as
the
first
to
consult
the
oracle
by
prissie
orders
she
shuffled
the
cards
then
handed
them
back
to
the
sorceress
who
laid
them
out
face
upward
in
rows
and
after
a
few
moments
meditation
began
her
prophecies
you
fair
and
therefore
the
queen
of
diamonds
is
your
representative
card
all
the
luck
behind
you
instead
of
facing
you
i
see
a
disappointment
and
great
changes
a
dark
woman
is
coming
into
your
life
she
connected
somehow
with
money
but
there
are
hearts
behind
her
you
take
a
journey
by
land
and
find
trouble
and
perplexity
have
you
anything
nicer
to
tell
me
than
that
pouted
dulcie
the
dark
woman
she
seems
to
be
a
relation
by
the
way
the
cards
are
placed
i
have
any
dark
relations
they
all
as
fair
as
fair
the
whole
family
it
silly
nonsense
i
do
believe
in
it
declared
lilias
emphatically
i
dare
say
it
is
but
it
fun
all
the
same
do
tell
mine
now
prissie
urged
noreen
gathering
up
the
cards
and
reshuffling
them
before
the
fates
could
be
further
consulted
however
the
big
bell
clanged
for
preparation
and
the
magician
was
obliged
to
pocket
her
cards
hurry
downstairs
get
out
her
lesson
books
and
write
a
piece
of
french
translation
while
the
inquirers
into
her
mysteries
also
separated
some
to
practise
piano
or
violin
and
some
to
study
a
dark
woman
scoffed
dulcie
spilling
the
ink
in
her
scorn
as
she
filled
her
fountain
pen
any
gypsy
would
have
told
me
a
fortune
like
that
i
let
you
know
when
she
comes
along
prissie
all
serene
bring
her
to
school
if
you
like
laughed
prissie
you
did
let
me
finish
or
i
might
have
gone
on
to
something
nicer
there
were
other
things
on
the
cards
as
well
as
those
what
things
oh
i
sha
tell
you
now
when
you
only
make
fun
of
them
sh
sh
here
miss
herbert
and
prissie
turning
away
from
her
comrade
opened
her
french
dictionary
and
plunged
into
the
difficulties
of
her
page
of
translation
from
racine
chapter
iv
disinherited
valentine
day
had
brought
early
flowers
and
the
song
of
the
thrush
and
glints
of
golden
sunshine
but
the
bright
weather
was
too
good
to
last
and
winter
again
stretched
out
an
icy
hand
to
check
the
advance
of
spring
green
daffodil
buds
peeped
through
a
covering
of
snow
and
the
yellow
jessamine
blossom
fell
sodden
in
the
rain
the
was
a
quagmire
and
the
girls
had
to
depend
upon
walking
for
their
daily
exercise
their
tramps
were
somewhat
of
an
adventure
for
in
places
the
swollen
brooks
were
washing
over
the
tops
of
their
bridges
and
they
would
be
obliged
to
turn
back
or
go
round
by
devious
ways
the
river
in
the
valley
had
overflowed
its
banks
and
spread
over
the
meadows
like
a
lake
tops
of
gates
and
hedges
appeared
above
the
flood
and
driven
inland
by
the
gales
swam
over
the
pastures
flocks
of
peewits
starlings
and
collected
on
the
uplands
and
an
occasional
heron
might
be
seen
flitting
majestically
across
the
sky
as
a
rule
the
school
sallied
forth
in
waterproofs
and
thick
boots
regardless
of
drizzle
or
slight
snow
but
on
days
of
blizzard
there
was
swedish
drill
or
dancing
in
the
big
to
work
off
the
superfluous
energy
accumulated
during
hours
of
sitting
still
at
lessons
one
afternoon
when
driving
sleet
and
showers
swept
past
the
house
and
an
inclement
sky
hid
every
hint
of
sunshine
the
twenty
girls
clad
in
their
gymnasium
costumes
were
hard
at
work
doing
indian
club
exercises
dulcie
who
stood
in
the
vicinity
of
the
window
could
watch
the
raindrops
splashing
on
the
pane
and
see
the
wet
waving
about
in
the
wind
and
runnels
of
water
coursing
down
the
drive
like
little
rivulets
it
was
the
sort
of
afternoon
when
nobody
who
could
help
it
would
choose
to
be
out
and
a
visitor
to
the
hall
seemed
about
the
most
unlikely
event
on
the
face
of
the
earth
judge
her
surprise
therefore
when
she
heard
the
hoot
of
a
and
the
next
instant
saw
coming
up
the
drive
the
daimler
touring
car
from
cheverley
chase
in
her
excitement
she
almost
dropped
her
clubs
had
cousin
clare
come
over
to
see
them
or
had
everard
a
holiday
she
longed
to
communicate
the
thrilling
news
to
lilias
but
the
music
was
still
going
on
and
her
arms
must
move
in
time
to
it
she
waited
in
a
flutter
of
expectation
revolving
all
kinds
of
delightful
possibilities
that
might
occur
cousin
clare
would
surely
send
a
cake
and
a
box
of
chocolates
even
if
she
had
not
come
herself
five
minutes
passed
then
davis
the
opened
the
door
and
whispered
a
brief
message
to
miss
perkins
the
mistress
held
up
her
hand
and
stopped
the
exercises
lilias
and
dulcie
are
wanted
at
once
in
the
study
she
said
amid
the
astonished
looks
of
their
companions
the
two
girls
put
down
their
clubs
and
left
the
room
dulcie
hastily
telling
her
sister
as
they
hurried
down
the
passage
how
she
had
seen
the
car
from
the
window
they
tapped
at
the
study
door
and
entered
full
of
pleasant
anticipation
miss
walters
was
standing
by
the
fire
with
a
letter
in
her
hand
come
in
girls
she
said
gravely
i
sent

something
very
sad
to
tell

prepare
your
minds
for
a
great
shock

how
grieved
i
am
you
must
be
brave
girls
and
try
to
comfort
every
one
else
at
home
it
will
be
a
sad
loss
for
you
all
lilias
and
dulcie
went
upstairs
almost
dazed
with
the
unexpected
bad
news
they
could
hardly
believe
that
their
grandfather
whom
they
had
left
apparently
in
the
best
of
health
and
spirits
could
have
gone
away
into
that
other
world
where
father
and
mother
and
a
little
sister
had
already
passed
over
before
they
packed
in
a
sort
of
dream
drank
the
cups
of
tea
which
miss
walters
full
of
kind
sympathy
pressed
upon
them
in
the
hall
greeted
milner
who
was
starting
his
engine
and
entered
the
waiting
car
owing
to
the
floods
they
took
a
roundabout
route
but
half
an
hour
drive
through
sleet
and
rain
brought
them
to
cheverley
chase
it
was
strange
to
see
the
blinds
all
down
as
they
drew
up
at
the
house
as
they
ran
indoors
winder
the
old
butler
came
from
his
pantry
into
the
hall
they
questioned
him
eagerly
he
shook
his
head
as
he
replied
it
a
sad
business
miss
lilias
and
miss
dulcie
he
was
just
as
usual
yesterday
then
about
nine
miss
clare
rang
the
bell
violently
and
when
i
came
into
the
there
was
master
lying
on
the
floor
in
a
kind
of
fit
i
telephoned
to
the
doctor
and
we
got
him
to
bed
but
he
never
recovered
consciousness
he
went
at
eleven
this
morning
as
you
see
by
the
clock
there
i
stopped
all
the
clocks
at
once
it
the
right
thing
to
do
in
a
house
when
the
master
dies
miss
clare
in
her
room
i
let
her
know
you
arrived
we
go
and
find
her
thank
you
said
lilias
walking
quietly
upstairs
the
ingleton
children
were
truly
grieved
at
the
loss
of
the
grandfather
who
for
so
many
years
had
stood
to
them
in
the
place
of
a
parent
they
went
softly
about
the
house
and
spoke
in
hushed
voices
everything
seemed
strange
and
unusual
a
dressmaker
came
from
london
with
boxes
of
mourning
for
cousin
clare
and
the
girls
beautiful
wreaths
and
crosses
of
flowers
kept
arriving
and
were
carried
upstairs
bowden
the
lawyer
was
constantly
in
and
out
making
arrangements
for
the
funeral
neighbors
left
cards
with
kind
sympathy
written
across
the
corner
everard
who
had
arrived
home
shortly
after
his
sisters
seemed
to
have
grown
years
older
he
walked
with
a
new
dignity
as
of
one
who
is
suddenly
called
to
fill
a
high
position
i
be
a
good
brother
to
you
all
he
said
to
the
younger
ones
you
must
always
look
upon
the
chase
as
your
home
of
course
i
do
everything
for
you
that
grandfather
ever
did
and
more
will
the
chase
be
yours
now
then
everard
asked
bevis
i
suppose
so
i
the
eldest
son
you
see
and
the
property
has
always
gone
in
the
direct
line
it
was
entailed
until
fifty
years
ago
i
make
any
changes
i
told
the
servants
so
and
they
all
said
they
wished
to
stay
on
i
would
part
with
winder
or
milner
for
the
world
they
part
of
the
establishment
i
could
imagine
the
place
without
them
agreed
dulcie
on
the
afternoon
before
the
funeral
bowden
who
had
motored
over
to
make
some
final
arrangements
concluded
his
business
drank
a
cup
of
tea
in
the
and
was
escorted
by
everard
and
lilias
through
the
hall
the
passing
of
the
squire
is
a
sad
loss
to
the
neighborhood
he
remarked
he
was
a
true
type
of
the
good
old
school
of
country
gentlemen
and
most
of
us
feel
shall
not
look
upon
his
like
again
no
replied
everard
it
will
be
very
hard
to
succeed
him
i
know
but
i
shall
try
to
do
my
best
bowden
started
looked
at
him
musingly
for
a
moment
knitted
his
brows
then
apparently
came
to
a
decision
instead
of
taking
his
hat
and
coat
from
winder
he
waved
the
two
young
people
into
the
study
followed
them
and
shut
the
door
i
want
a
word
with
you
in
private
he
began
i
going
to
do
a
very
unprofessional
thing
but
as
i
known
you
for
years
i
feel
the
case
justifies
me
i
ca
let
you
come
into
the
after
the
funeral
and
hear
your
grandfather
will
read
aloud
without
giving
you
some
warning
beforehand
of
its
contents
i
hinted
to
you
everard
at
not
to
count
too
much
upon
expectations
why
but
surely
i
am
the
heir
burst
out
everard
with
white
lips
my
poor
boy
you
are
nothing
of
the
sort
your
grandfather
has
willed
the
property
to
the
child
of
his
elder
son
tristram
at
that
critical
moment
there
was
a
rap
at
the
door
and
winder
the
butler
entered
respectfully
apologetic
to
summon
bowden
to
the
telephone
the
lawyer
answered
the
call
which
was
apparently
a
very
urgent
one
for
without
another
word
to
everard
and
lilias
he
took
hat
and
coat
hurried
from
the
house
mounted
his
and
was
gone
he
left
utter
consternation
behind
him
the
two
young
people
returning
to
the
study
tried
to
face
the
disastrous
news
he
had
indeed
told
them
no
details
but
the
main
outline
was
quite
sufficient
they
could
scarcely
accustom
themselves
to
believe
it
for
a
moment
or
two
to
bring
me
up
as
the
heir
and
then
disinherit
me
gasped
everard
why
everybody
called
you
young
squire
exclaimed
lilias
unthinkable
unthinkable
or
not
i
afraid
it
true
said
everard
bitterly
bowden
would
have
told
me
otherwise
i
suppose
he
drew
up
the
will
so
he
knows
what
in
it
nice
position
to
be
in
is
it
turned
out
to
make
room
for
some
other
chap
who
is
this
child
of
uncle
tristram
we
never
heard
of
him
it
be
the
kid
who
is
in
that
photo
i
suppose
leslie
he
looked
about
a
year
old
in
the
portrait
and
it
thirteen
years
since
uncle
tristram
died
so
he
probably
fourteen
or
so
now
to
think
of
a
kid
of
fourteen
taking
place
here
it
monstrous
oh
everard
what
we
do
i
do
know
i
going
out
to
think
it
over
do
say
a
word
about
it
to
anybody
yet
promise
me
you
wo
everard
seized
his
cap
and
waterproof
and
plunged
into
the
rain
he
did
not
return
till
if
he
was
silent
and
preoccupied
at
that
meal
both
cousin
clare
and
dulcie
set
it
down
as
natural
to
his
new
sense
of
responsibility
lilias
looked
at
him
uneasily
there
was
a
hardness
in
his
face
which
she
had
never
seen
there
before
she
longed
to
catch
him
alone
and
question
him
but
after
dinner
he
purposely
avoided
her
and
left
a
message
that
he
had
gone
to
the
stables
she
would
have
liked
to
confide
in
cousin
clare
but
she
had
given
her
promise
to
keep
the
secret
and
even
dulcie
must
not
share
it
yet
the
girls
slept
in
separate
rooms
at
home
so
that
when
lilias
had
said
good
night
to
the
family
she
was
alone
she
went
to
bed
as
a
matter
of
course
but
tossed
about
with
throbbing
heart
and
whirling
brain
bowden
information
had
effectually
banished
sleep
in
about
an
hour
when
the
house
was
absolutely
quiet
came
a
soft
tap
at
her
door
she
jumped
up
hastily
threw
on
her
and
opened
it
everard
stood
in
the
passage
outside
may
i
come
in
i
want
to
speak
to
you
sissy
it
important
he
whispered
i
thought
you
had
gone
to
bed
said
lilias
admitting
him
and
dragging
forward
two
basket
chairs
what
is
it
everard
do
look
like
that
you
frighten
me
her
brother
had
seated
himself
wearily
and
buried
his
head
in
his
hands
he
raised
two
haggard
eyes
at
her
words
i
come
to
say
to
you
sis
i
going
away
speak
to
me
for
i
not
in
a
mood
for
argument
do
you
think
that
i
could
stand
by
grandfather
grave
when
i
know
he
has
disinherited
me
i
tell
you
i
ca
i
not
going
to
stay
and
hear
the
will
read
if
i
kicked
out
of
the
property
at
least
i
keep
my
dignity
why
everybody
on
the
estate
believed
i
was
the
heir
only
this
afternoon
rogerson
the
new
asked
me
to
keep
him
on
and
hicks
said
he
serve
me
as
faithfully
as
he
served
the
old
squire
how
could
i
face
the
servants
when
they
knew
the
chase
mine
after
all
the
humiliation
would
be
intolerable
no
i
all
the
ingleton
pride
in
me
and
if
i
not
to
be
master
here
i
shake
the
dust
of
the
place
off
my
feet
for
ever
grandfather
will
have
made
some
provisions
for
you
younger
ones
he
always
promised
to
do
that
and
right
you
should
take
it
but
as
for
me
if
he
left
me
anything
i
do
mean
to
touch
a
penny
of
it
it
must
be
all
or
nothing
you
others
are
welcome
to
my
share
whatever
it
is
i
going
out
into
the
world
to
earn
my
own
living
he
spoke
forcibly
and
with
desperate
earnestness
to
lilias
watching
him
anxiously
he
seemed
in
these
few
hours
to
have
changed
from
a
boy
into
a
man
eager
words
rose
to
her
lips
but
he
stood
up
and
stopped
her
i
told
you
it
no
use
arguing
my
mind
absolutely
made
up
ordered
elton
to
have
the
small
car
ready
and
to
drive
me
to
balderton
to
catch
the
midnight
express
to
town
it
the
last
order
i
shall
give
in
this
house
he
looked
surprised
but
he
did
dare
to
question
me
everybody
will
know
that
i
no
more
authority
here
than
the
kids
i
be
far
away
by
then
thank
goodness
but
everard
what
are
you
going
to
do
in
london
how
can
you
earn
your
own
living
pressed
lilias
sweep
a
crossing
or
go
to
sea
i
do
care
what
happens
to
me
sis
i
off
you
may
tell
the
others
if
you
like
no
i
wo
promise
to
write
you
be
better
without
me
closed
this
chapter
of
my
life
completely
and
i
going
to
begin
a
different
one
the
two
wo
bear
mixing
up
giving
his
sister
a
hasty
kiss
everard
left
the
room
and
walked
softly
away
down
the
passage
a
few
minutes
later
lilias
heard
the
sound
of
wheels
and
looking
through
the
window
saw
the
rear
lights
of
the
car
disappearing
down
the
drive
and
away
across
the
park
she
went
back
to
bed
sobbing
chapter
v
the
new
owner
the
wild
wind
and
rain
which
for
some
weeks
had
blown
from
the
north
changed
suddenly
to
a
southerly
breeze
and
the
sun
shone
out
in
all
its
spring
glory
on
the
day
of
ingleton
funeral
half
the
came
to
do
honor
to
the
old
squire
he
had
been
a
favorite
in
the
neighborhood
and
people
forgot
his
autocratic
ways
and
remembered
now
only
his
many
kindnesses
the
absence
of
everard
who
should
have
been
the
chief
representative
of
the
family
caused
universal
comment
and
some
rumor
of
the
state
of
affairs
began
to
be
passed
round
among
the
servants
and
guests
cousin
clare
to
whom
lilias
had
confided
the
secret
of
her
brother
flight
shook
her
head
he
might
at
least
have
shown
his
grandfather
the
respect
of
following
him
to
his
grave
she
commented
he
owed
that
to
him
at
any
rate
i
thought
everard
would
have
realized
such
an
obvious
duty
whatever
comes
or
does
not
come
to
us
in
the
way
of
legacies
can
not
free
us
from
our
obligations
to
the
dead
it
seems
to
me
hardly
decent
to
be
thinking
about
the
disposal
of
the
property
while
its
late
owner
is
still
unburied
lilias
crept
away
crying
she
knew
there
was
justice
in
cousin
scathing
judgment
but
she
was
sure
the
latter
did
not
could
not
understand
the
extent
of
everard
bitter
disappointment
she
did
not
care
to
say
any
more
or
ask
questions
and
could
only
wait
until
the
whole
sad
miserable
affair
was
over
some
of
the
guests
returned
to
the
house
after
the
funeral
and
these
with
the
family
were
present
when
bowden
read
aloud
the
will
of
the
late
squire
of
cheverley
chase
like
most
testamentary
documents
it
was
couched
in
legal
terms
but
lilias
and
dulcie
sitting
in
their
black
dresses
beside
cousin
clare
grasped
the
main
features
there
were
certain
legacies
to
servants
and
friends
a
provision
for
each
of
the
grandchildren
and
for
cousin
clare
then
the
entire
residue
of
the
estate
was
bequeathed
to
leslie
only
child
of
my
elder
son
tristram
all
except
the
few
who
had
known
the
secret
beforehand
were
filled
with
surprise
that
everard
who
had
always
been
regarded
in
the
neighborhood
as
the
young
squire
should
have
been
passed
over
in
favor
of
another
heir
the
guests
however
after
a
word
or
two
of
sympathy
took
their
departure
and
went
away
to
spread
the
news
leaving
the
family
alone
to
discuss
matters
among
themselves
so
i
suppose
the
chase
is
our
home
any
longer
asked
dulcie
as
the
young
ingletons
clustered
round
their
cousin
for
explanations
who
is
this
leslie
we
never
heard
anything
of
him
before
i
did
know
uncle
tristram
had
a
son
said
roland
will
everything
be
his
instead
of
everard
asked
bevis
pitifully
no
and
yes
replied
cousin
clare
the
estate
is
certainly
left
to
leslie
but
as
it
happens
she
is
a
daughter
and
not
a
son
here
was
a
surprise
indeed
a
daughter
echoed
lilias
the
chase
left
to
a
girl
remember
she
is
the
daughter
of
the
elder
son
so
that
in
your
grandfather
opinion
she
was
the
lawful
heiress
but
where
does
she
live
how
old
is
she
why
have
we
never
seen
her
it
a
long
story
said
cousin
clare
but
without
going
into
any
details
i
can
tell
you
briefly
that
years
ago
your
grandfather
and
your
uncle
tristram
had
a
serious
quarrel
it
was
about
a
lady
whom
your
grandfather
thought
his
elder
son
loved
and
whom
he
very
much
wished
him
to
marry
well
we
ca
love
to
order
and
though
tristram
liked
and
respected
the
prospective
bride
whom
his
father
had
chosen
for
him
he
had
given
his
heart
to
a
beautiful
italian
girl
and
he
insisted
upon
marrying
her
the
affair
caused
a
complete
breach
between
them
but
shortly
before
tristram
death
he
patched
up
a
half
reconciliation
and
sent
home
a
photograph
of
his
wife
and
little
daughter
whom
he
named
after
her
grandfather
i
believe
some
years
ago
an
effort
was
made
to
bring
the
child
over
to
england
to
be
educated
but
her
mother
who
by
that
time
was
married
again
and
living
in
sicily
refused
to
give
her
up
to
her
english
relations
i
have
never
seen
her
myself
but
she
must
be
quite
fourteen
years
old
by
now
it
will
be
a
great
surprise
to
her
to
learn
that
she
succeeds
to
the
property
and
a
great
disappointment
to
us
said
lilias
bitterly
it
seems
most
unfair
when
we
lived
at
the
chase
all
these
years
that
this
interloper
should
step
in
and
turn
us
out
of
our
home
i
hate
her
declared
clifford
clenching
his
little
fists
no
no
dears
do
take
it
in
that
way
begged
cousin
clare
remember
that
after
all
the
chase
was
grandfather
property
and
he
had
absolute
right
to
leave
it
to
whom
he
pleased
he
stood
in
the
place
of
parents
to
you
all
but
that
did
not
mean
that
he
must
will
the
estate
to
everard
leslie
is
also
his
grandchild
and
belongs
to
the
elder
branch
of
the
family
he
has
left
you
each
a
most
generous
legacy
so
that
there
is
plenty
for
your
education
i
do
know
what
arrangements
will
be
made
for
you
but
bowden
is
one
of
your
guardians
and
he
is
such
a
kind
friend
that
i
am
sure
he
can
be
thoroughly
trusted
to
take
good
care
of
your
affairs
try
to
look
on
the
bright
side
of
things
matters
might
be
so
much
worse
in
lilias
opinion
at
any
rate
matters
were
quite
bad
enough
as
everard
particular
chum
she
took
his
disinheritance
more
hardly
than
dulcie
she
wondered
what
he
was
doing
in
london
and
if
he
would
send
her
his
address
it
angered
her
that
bowden
took
his
departure
quite
calmly
and
seemed
to
think
he
would
turn
up
again
in
a
few
days
when
he
had
spent
the
money
he
had
taken
with
him
she
knew
her
brother
too
well
for
that
and
was
sure
that
his
pride
would
not
allow
him
to
return
either
to
cheverley
or
to
harrow
in
the
character
of
a
disappointed
heir
in
that
respect
she
could
entirely
sympathize
with
him
she
and
dulcie
went
back
to
chilcombe
hall
at
the
beginning
of
the
next
week
and
though
all
their
companions
were
very
kind
and
sympathetic
it
was
humiliating
to
be
obliged
to
acknowledge
that
the
chase
was
no
longer
virtually
their
home
for
the
present
as
the
heiress
was
a
minor
the
estate
was
in
the
hands
of
the
executors
bowden
decided
to
send
bevis
and
clifford
to
the
same
preparatory
school
as
roland
and
cousin
clare
after
various
letters
and
telegrams
departed
on
a
mission
to
sicily
to
interview
leslie
mother
and
stepfather
what
the
purport
of
her
visit
might
be
the
girls
had
as
yet
no
hint
the
weeks
dragged
wearily
on
towards
easter
though
dulcie
might
throw
herself
into
hockey
or
basket
ball
to
lilias
school
interests
seemed
to
have
lost
their
former
zest
she
wondered
where
they
were
to
spend
their
holidays
various
friends
had
extended
invitations
but
bowden
to
whom
everything
must
now
be
referred
had
not
yet
written
to
consent
at
last
came
his
reply
i
have
arranged
for
you
and
your
sister
to
spend
your
holidays
as
usual
at
the
chase
miss
clare
will
be
arriving
back
from
sicily
and
will
bring
your
cousin
leslie
with
her
they
would
like
you
to
be
at
home
to
receive
them
lilias
showing
the
letter
to
dulcie
in
the
privacy
of
the
blue
bedroom
simply
raged
it
bad
when
we
were
so
keen
to
go
to
london
too
why
should
we
be
there
to
receive
madame
leslie
i
should
like
to
know
i
want
to
see
her
neither
do
i
only
i
wonder
what
she
like
all
the
same
ventured
dulcie
can
she
speak
english
and
will
she
take
over
the
whole
place
and
make
us
feel
it
hers
no
doubt
she
will
we
shall
have
to
take
very
back
seats
indeed
just
too
disgusting
for
words
i
really
think
bowden
need
have
forced
this
upon
us
the
girls
will
be
ever
so
sorry
for
us
i
know
and
that
just
what
i
hate
i
ca
bear
to
be
pitied
the
easter
exodus
seemed
very
different
indeed
from
the
happy
breaking
up
of
last
christmas
no
rajah
and
peri
with
glossy
coats
and
arching
necks
came
to
take
lilias
and
dulcie
from
school
and
give
them
the
delight
of
a
ride
over
the
hills
though
milner
arrived
with
the
car
and
told
them
that
he
was
to
fetch
their
three
younger
brothers
on
the
following
morning
the
chase
seemed
lonely
and
deserted
with
nobody
to
welcome
them
except
the
servants
it
brought
back
vividly
those
few
sad
days
of
drawn
blinds
and
the
memory
of
the
long
black
line
slowly
disappearing
down
the
drive
they
had
supper
by
themselves
and
spent
a
very
quiet
evening
reading
in
the
the
advent
next
day
of
roland
bevis
and
clifford
certainly
enlivened
the
atmosphere
and
things
would
have
felt
like
old
times
again
had
it
not
been
for
the
shadow
of
the
arrival
of
the
heiress
a
telegram
had
been
received
from
cousin
clare
announcing
the
train
and
the
car
was
to
meet
them
at
the
station
on
that
same
evening
winder
and
the
other
servants
were
bustling
about
getting
the
house
in
order
for
its
new
mistress
a
log
fire
was
lighted
in
the
hall
and
plants
in
pots
were
carried
in
from
the
conservatory
the
union
jack
fluttered
from
over
the
porch
and
the
gardener
had
put
up
some
decorations
with
the
word
welcome
five
very
sober
young
people
stood
in
the
and
watched
as
the
car
came
up
the
drive
to
the
front
door
next
minute
they
heard
cousin
clare
cheerful
voice
calling
to
them
and
they
came
shyly
forth
into
the
hall
standing
on
the
persian
rug
in
front
of
the
log
fire
was
a
girl
of
about
fourteen
an
erect
slender
graceful
little
figure
with
dark
silky
hair
hanging
in
loose
curls
and
wonderful
bright
eyes
that
were
dark
and
yet
full
of
light
and
seemed
to
shine
like
stars
for
an
instant
she
included
the
ingletons
in
one
comprehensive
glance
then
her
whole
face
broke
into
eager
smiles
i
know
which
of
you
is
which
lilias
dulcie
roland
bevis
clifford
she
declared
shaking
hands
with
each
i
very
rich
to
have
five
new
cousins
all
at
once
you
must
show
me
everything
the
rabbits
and
the
dogs
and
the
tame
jackdaw
oh
yes
i
been
hearing
about
them
and
about
you
cousin
clare
told
me
just
what
you
would
be
like
i
kept
asking
her
questions
the
whole
way
she
spoke
prettily
and
without
a
trace
of
a
foreign
accent
her
manner
was
warm
and
friendly
she
looked
indeed
as
if
she
would
like
to
kiss
her
new
relations
she
was
so
entirely
different
from
what
the
ingletons
had
expected
that
in
their
utter
amazement
they
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
in
reply
and
stood
gazing
at
her
in
embarrassed
silence
cousin
clare
saved
the
situation
carmel
child
you
tired
out
she
decreed
i
going
to
take
you
straight
upstairs
and
put
you
to
bed
hours
of
traveling
is
too
much
for
anybody
and
you
never
slept
in
the
train
come
along
you
must
make
friends
with
your
cousins
long
afterwards
when
dulcie
tried
to
analyze
her
first
impressions
of
the
she
realized
that
what
struck
her
most
was
the
extreme
charm
of
her
personality
we
have
all
possibly
gone
through
a
similar
psychic
experience
of
meeting
somebody
against
whom
we
had
conceived
a
bitter
prejudice
and
finding
our
intended
hatred
suddenly
veer
round
into
love
the
effect
is
like
stepping
out
into
what
you
imagine
will
be
a
blizzard
and
finding
warm
sunshine
the
little
mistress
of
the
chase
was
very
weary
with
her
long
journey
but
when
at
last
she
was
sufficiently
rested
to
be
shown
round
her
demesne
she
made
her
royal
progress
with
an
escort
of
cousins
you
like
to
see
your
property
lilias
began
shyly
leading
the
way
into
the
garden
do
call
it
mine
i
want
you
all
to
understand
at
the
very
beginning
that
it
still
your
home
and
i
do
wish
to
take
it
from
you
i
have
my
own
dear
home
in
sicily
and
i
hope
to
go
back
there
some
day
while
i
in
england
let
me
be
your
visitor
that
all
i
want
i
ca
bear
to
think
that
i
taking
anybody
place
or
anything
that
ought
to
belong
to
some
one
else
if
only
mother
were
here
explain
properly
but
it
yours
leslie
objected
dulcie
in
a
way
yes
but
in
another
way
no
it
can
be
mine
and
yours
at
the
same
time
and
please
will
you
call
me
carmel
leslie
is
a
boy
name
not
a
girl
i
always
carmel
at
home
i
did
want
to
leave
home
at
all
but
mother
and
daddy
said
i
must
go
with
cousin
clare
when
she
had
come
all
the
way
to
sicily
to
fetch
me
they
promised
it
should
be
only
a
visit
lilias
and
dulcie
could
hardly
believe
the
evidence
of
their
ears
they
had
expected
carmel
to
be
appraising
her
new
property
with
keen
satisfaction
instead
of
which
she
appeared
to
be
suffering
from
a
bad
attack
of
homesickness
she
looked
at
the
gardens
the
stables
and
all
the
pets
with
interest
but
without
any
apparent
sense
of
proprietorship
her
behavior
was
exactly
that
of
an
ordinary
visitor
who
admires
a
friend
possessions
in
her
talk
she
referred
constantly
to
her
home
in
sicily
to
her
stepfather
and
her
younger
brothers
and
sisters
they
and
her
mother
were
evidently
the
supreme
center
of
her
life
we
thought
you
only
know
italian
confided
dulcie
whose
shyness
was
beginning
to
wear
off
carmel
laughed
of
course
i
talk
italian
too
but
we
always
speak
english
at
home
is
it
strange
that
mother
should
have
married
two
englishmen
i
remember
my
own
father
at
all
but
daddy
is
a
dear
and
we
tremendous
friends
i
brought
his
photo
and
mother
and
the
children
show
them
to
you
when
i
unpacked
carmel
astounding
attitude
while
it
amazed
her
cousins
in
the
extreme
was
certainly
highly
satisfactory
the
boys
when
they
realized
that
she
had
no
desire
to
wrest
their
pets
from
them
waxed
suddenly
friendly
with
the
naïve
impulsiveness
of
childhood
they
gave
her
a
full
account
of
what
they
had
expected
her
to
be
perhaps
i
was
rather
frightened
of
you
too
till
i
saw
you
all
she
confessed
we
none
of
us
turned
out
such
dreadful
bogies
have
we
do
you
know
what
i
going
to
call
you
said
clifford
slipping
a
plump
hand
into
hers
and
gazing
up
into
the
shining
brown
eyes
princess
carmel
and
carmel
bent
down
and
kissed
him
chapter
vi
princess
carmel
in
the
long
talk
which
cousin
clare
had
had
with
and
greville
in
sicily
it
had
been
arranged
that
carmel
was
to
be
sent
to
school
with
lilias
and
dulcie
at
chilcombe
hall
the
new
term
therefore
saw
her
established
in
a
little
which
led
out
of
the
blue
bedroom
and
which
by
good
luck
happened
to
be
vacated
by
evie
hughes
who
had
left
at
easter
it
was
soon
spread
over
with
carmel
private
possessions
they
were
different
from
the
equipment
of
an
ordinary
english
schoolgirl
and
aroused
as
much
interest
as
their
owner
first
there
were
the
portraits
of
her
mother
of
her
stepfather
greville
and
of
the
little
and
sisters
bertram
nina
vincent
and
luigia
taken
by
an
italian
photographer
in
wonderfully
artistic
poses
and
with
classic
backgrounds
of
pillars
and
palm
trees
then
there
were
fascinating
snapshots
of
her
home
a
white
sicilian
house
with
a
veranda
and
its
lovely
garden
with
fountains
and
statues
and
pomegranate
blossom
and
trees
hung
with
ripe
oranges
and
lemons
carmel
things
seemed
nearly
all
foreign
her
nightdress
case
was
of
drawn
linen
beautifully
embroidered
by
the
nuns
at
a
convent
her
was
of
inlaid
wood
from
sorrento
the
trinkets
on
her
were
italian
her
clothes
and
shoes
bore
the
names
of
paris
shops
some
of
the
books
she
had
brought
with
her
were
in
french
the
calendar
that
hung
on
her
wall
held
pictures
of
naples
and
vesuvius
carmel
was
undoubtedly
a
most
unusual
combination
of
two
nationalities
though
in
some
respects
she
was
english
enough
there
was
a
certain
little
gracious
dignity
and
finish
about
her
manners
that
was
peculiarly
southern
clifford
with
a
child
true
instinct
had
named
her
princess
she
was
indeed
royal
with
that
best
type
of
good
breeding
which
gives
equal
courtesy
to
all
be
it
queen
or
beggar
in
the
school
she
was
soon
an
immense
favorite
the
girls
admired
her
attitude
towards
lilias
and
dulcie
if
she
had
posed
as
the
heiress
of
the
chase
they
would
probably
have
sat
upon
her
thoroughly
but
as
she
never
put
forward
her
claims
in
that
respect
they
were
disposed
to
show
her
decided
consideration
all
the
more
so
as
she
was
visibly
fretting
for
her
sicilian
home
she
put
a
brave
face
on
things
in
the
but
at
night
she
would
be
caught
crying
and
her
eagerness
for
letters
was
pathetic
poor
child
she
like
an
exotic
plant
transferred
to
a
northern
soil
said
miss
walters
we
must
try
to
settle
her
somehow
it
wo
do
for
her
to
go
about
with
dark
rings
round
her
eyes
i
wonder
how
we
could
possibly
interest
her
i
do
believe
our
school
happenings
appeal
to
her
in
the
least
certainly
the
went
through
the
ordinary
routine
of
classes
walks
and
games
without
any
display
of
enthusiasm
gowan
barbour
tried
to
coach
her
at
cricket
but
the
result
was
not
successful
it
a
boy
game
and
the
ball
is
so
hard
it
hurts
my
hands
objected
carmel
did
you
play
cricket
at
home
never
or
tennis
on
a
cinder
court
the
sun
scorched
up
our
grass
court
what
used
you
to
do
then
to
amuse
yourself
we
made
paper
dresses
for
the
carnival
and
sometimes
we
acted
we
used
to
have
plays
on
the
veranda
or
in
the
garden
and
we
went
on
picnics
to
the
hills
it
was
beautiful
there
in
spring
when
the
anemones
were
out
in
the
fields
we
to
have
a
picnic
next
saturday
announced
gowan
i
heard
miss
walters
telling
miss
herbert
so
it
was
perhaps
with
special
reference
to
carmel
that
miss
walters
had
arranged
an
outing
for
the
school
it
was
bluebell
time
and
the
woods
in
the
neighborhood
would
be
a
show
by
permission
of
the
owner
sir
ranald
joynson
they
were
to
have
access
to
large
private
grounds
and
to
be
allowed
to
ramble
in
his
famous
rhododendron
gardens
none
of
the
girls
had
ever
been
there
before
so
it
was
a
treat
for
all
motor
wagonettes
were
to
convey
them
all
the
six
miles
they
were
to
start
after
an
early
lunch
and
to
take
tea
baskets
with
them
even
carmel
cheered
up
at
the
pleasant
prospect
you
have
a
treat
before
you
dulcie
assured
her
you
may
talk
about
your
sicilian
flowers
but
just
wait
till
you
have
seen
an
english
wood
full
of
bluebells
there
nothing
to
beat
it
in
the
whole
world
often
heard
of
sir
ranald
joynson
grounds
we
in
luck
to
get
leave
to
go
in
them
because
i
believe
he
generally
rather
stingy
about
allowing
people
there
i
wonder
how
miss
walters
managed
it
she
a
clever
woman
said
gowan
she
always
seems
to
manage
to
get
what
she
wants
some
people
do
i
wish
did
wailed
bertha
i
wanted
a
principal
part
in
the
french
plays
ever
since
i
came
to
school
and
mademoiselle
never
will
give
me
one
i
always
have
to
be
a
servant
or
an
extra
guest
and
speak
about
two
lines
well
your
french
accent
is
so
atrociously
bad
i
do
wonder
returned
gowan
you
certainly
would
be
a
credit
to
mademoiselle
in
a
principal
part
and
you
very
stiff
and
wooden
in
acting
too
thank
you
for
your
compliments
sniffed
bertha
much
offended
oh
do
be
sarkie
i
must
tell
the
truth
cheer
up
it
a
picnic
on
saturday
not
a
french
play
thank
goodness
it
is
rejoiced
dulcie
i
hate
mademoiselle
french
afternoons
i
do
know
which
is
worst
to
have
to
learn
and
act
yards
of
dialogue
or
to
sit
in
the
audience
and
listen
while
other
people
show
off
i
like
treats
i
an
girl
the
occupants
of
the
blue
bedroom
decided
that
it
was
high
time
something
happened
to
stir
up
carmel
who
was
behaving
more
like
an
exile
than
an
heiress
now
the
first
excitement
of
her
arrival
and
unpacking
was
over
she
had
relapsed
into
a
piteous
fit
of
homesickness
i
believe
she
crying
again
said
dulcie
laying
an
ear
to
the
door
that
communicated
with
the
do
you
think
i
ought
to
go
in
to
her
it
no
use
declared
lilias
i
went
last
night
and
tried
to
comfort
her
and
i
sure
i
only
made
her
cry
harder
best
leave
her
to
herself
homesick
people
always
do
cry
harder
if
you
sympathize
proclaimed
gowan
i
was
prefect
of
the
junior
dormitory
at
my
other
school
before
i
came
here
and
the
new
kids
always
turned
on
the
water
works
at
first
i
learnt
how
to
manage
them
sympathy
makes
them
worse
what
you
want
is
to
switch
their
minds
off
thinking
about
home
and
make
them
enjoy
school
life
carmel
will
come
round
in
time
meantime
said
bertha
she
reminds
me
of
that
picture
in
miss
walters
study
hostage
you
know
the
one
i
mean
the
girl
standing
leaning
over
the
castle
wall
and
gazing
out
to
sea
and
evidently
thinking
of
her
own
country
i
wonder
if
princesses
who
were
sent
to
be
married
to
foreign
princes
felt
homesick
i
dare
say
they
did
grunted
gowan
but
i
sure
my
plan
the
best
for
curing
the
complaint
smack
them
on
the
back
and
make
them
cheer
up
instead
of
letting
them
weep
on
your
shoulder
i
do
like
a
damp
atmosphere
to
do
carmel
justice
however
acute
her
sense
of
exile
might
be
she
had
not
obtruded
her
woes
upon
her
schoolfellows
and
had
conducted
her
weeping
in
secret
if
sounds
of
distress
filtered
through
the
door
it
was
only
when
matters
seemed
particularly
hopeless
on
saturday
she
came
down
dressed
for
the
jaunt
and
all
smiles
sit
her
between
edith
and
bertha
commanded
gowan
and
tell
them
they
may
be
their
silliest
make
her
laugh
till
she
weak
i
take
a
turn
at
her
myself
later
do
let
her
mope
about
in
the
woods
alone
keep
close
to
her
and
make
all
the
insane
jokes
you
can
i
tell
you
i
was
homesick
myself
once
though
you
may
believe
it
i
do
often
dab
my
eyes
now
do
i
here
are
the
wagonettes
said
dulcie
why
that
driver
has
stuck
up
a
flag
how
nice
of
him
it
looks
so
festive
bags
me
go
in
his
chariot
it
took
a
little
while
to
arrange
mistresses
girls
and
inside
the
two
motors
but
at
last
everything
was
packed
in
and
they
started
off
in
the
direction
of
bradstone
other
people
were
out
enjoying
saturday
holiday
and
cars
bicycles
and
conveyances
were
frequent
on
the
road
grinsdale
park
their
destination
was
approached
by
great
gates
outside
which
the
wagonettes
stopped
and
unloaded
their
passengers
miss
walters
armed
with
sir
ranald
joynson
letter
called
at
the
lodge
for
permission
to
enter
and
her
credentials
being
in
strict
order
the
party
was
duly
admitted
wo
everybody
who
sees
us
go
in
be
just
green
with
envy
rejoiced
edith
did
you
see
how
those
two
cyclists
tried
to
hang
on
to
us
and
push
in
too
miss
walters
looked
at
them
most
witheringly
i
ask
if
you
have
a
private
permit
i
heard
her
say
to
them
it
squashed
them
flat
and
they
beat
a
retreat
i
believe
sir
ranald
used
to
let
the
public
in
at
one
time
said
noreen
but
people
behaved
so
atrociously
that
he
had
to
stop
rough
boys
used
to
tear
about
and
break
the
bushes
and
take
the
flowers
and
do
a
great
deal
of
damage
i
know
i
heard
about
it
said
lilias
they
went
too
and
took
all
the
eggs
that
was
the
absolute
finish
sir
ranald
is
very
keen
on
natural
history
and
he
keeps
these
grounds
as
a
sort
of
bird
sanctuary
i
believe
quite
rare
kinds
build
here
and
he
never
lets
them
be
disturbed
i
wonder
he
gave
us
a
permit
to
come
well
you
see
most
of
the
young
birds
are
fledged
by
now
and
besides
he
would
expect
us
to
go
about
climbing
trees
and
robbing
nests
carrying
the
amongst
them
the
party
started
forth
along
the
drive
but
after
ten
minutes
walking
turned
down
a
bypath
into
the
woods
they
were
at
the
edge
of
a
beautiful
lake
and
on
one
side
of
them
stretched
a
gleaming
expanse
of
water
edged
with
shimmering
reeds
and
on
the
other
grew
thick
groves
of
trees
with
a
carpet
of
wild
hyacinths
beneath
the
sun
glinted
through
the
new
green
leaves
on
to
the
springing
bracken
and
bluebells
and
made
long
rifts
of
light
across
the
water
birds
were
flitting
about
and
twittering
in
the
trees
and
everywhere
there
was
that
delicious
scent
of
the
woodlands
a
mixture
of
honey
and
flowers
and
warm
moist
earth
and
damp
moss
which
is
the
incense
nature
burns
at
the
shrine
of
the
goddess
of
spring
it
was
so
lovely
that
the
party
straggled
considerably
they
could
not
help
putting
down
the
and
leaving
the
path
to
explore
and
gather
flowers
there
were
so
many
delightful
surprises
phillida
and
noreen
noticed
a
moorhen
nest
built
on
an
overhanging
bough
that
swept
the
lake
and
saw
four
tiny
downy
creatures
swimming
away
very
fast
to
take
cover
ursula
found
a
specimen
of
the
and
triumphed
immensely
partly
on
botanical
grounds
and
partly
because
she
regarded
it
as
an
omen
of
early
matrimony
though
needless
to
say
this
latter
aspect
of
her
rejoicing
was
not
communicated
to
miss
walters
only
chuckled
over
in
private
with
her
intimate
friends
knowing
that
the
girls
would
not
do
any
damage
the
mistresses
allowed
them
to
disperse
on
the
understanding
that
they
came
at
once
when
they
heard
the
guide
whistle
dulcie
carmel
and
prissie
had
wandered
away
down
the
banks
of
the
little
stream
where
grew
pale
marsh
violets
golden
globeflowers
and
the
fern
pushing
through
the
undergrowth
above
the
water
they
found
themselves
in
a
tiny
natural
clearing
such
as
poets
of
old
would
have
described
as
a
a
bower
budding
trees
encircled
it
a
guelder
rose
bush
overtopped
it
and
delicate
moss
sprang
through
the
grass
underfoot
there
were
fairies
too
in
the
bower
four
little
whitethroats
were
flitting
about
in
the
sunshine
it
was
perhaps
their
first
exodus
from
the
nest
for
as
yet
they
were
without
the
slightest
sense
of
fear
they
allowed
the
girls
to
catch
them
fondle
them
and
stroke
their
lovely
plumage
they
would
fly
delicately
away
twittering
with
pleasure
then
flit
back
to
the
caressing
hands
like
sprites
at
play
anything
more
innocent
and
beautiful
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
conceive
it
was
like
a
glimpse
into
paradise
before
the
fear
and
dread
of
man
had
passed
over
god
lesser
creatures
the
girls
stood
absolutely
fascinated
till
at
last
attracted
perhaps
by
some
warning
their
dainty
bird
friends
took
a
sudden
rapid
flight
into
the
woods
and
were
gone
carmel
looked
after
them
with
shining
eyes
it
like
francis
of
assissi
and
his
sisters
the
birds
she
said
softly
have
you
read
the
flowers
of
and
how
he
preached
to
the
swallows
and
they
all
flocked
round
him
and
twittered
i
never
seen
birds
so
tame
as
this
they
are
in
sicily
you
can
hardly
ever
get
near
them
there
they
are
in
england
either
said
dulcie
though
our
gamekeeper
told
us
that
if
you
can
just
chance
to
see
them
when
they
first
leave
the
nest
they
do
know
what
fear
is
he
once
found
some
wild
ducks
and
they
were
perfectly
unafraid
but
when
he
passed
the
place
half
an
hour
later
the
mother
duck
gave
a
call
and
the
little
ones
would
let
him
come
anywhere
near
them
they
had
their
lesson
and
learnt
fear
i
once
brought
up
a
starling
that
had
tumbled
out
of
a
nest
said
prissie
and
it
was
always
perfectly
tame
and
would
let
me
stroke
it
and
would
perch
on
my
hand
i
had
it
for
years
do
you
think
we
could
have
kept
the
whitethroats
no
no
said
carmel
quickly
i
as
soon
think
of
caging
fairies
it
would
be
a
shame
to
take
them
out
of
this
lovely
wood
it
their
i
so
glad
sir
ranald
does
allow
boys
to
come
in
here
i
thought
at
first
it
was
rather
selfish
of
him
but
i
begin
to
understand
there
must
be
some
quiet
places
left
where
the
birds
can
be
undisturbed
i
glad
to
have
seen
these
miss
walter
whistle
sounding
loudly
in
the
distance
recalled
them
to
the
path
they
found
the
school
very
excited
over
a
heronry
which
they
could
see
on
an
island
in
the
lake
some
large
untidy
nests
were
in
the
trees
and
every
now
and
then
a
heron
with
long
legs
outstretched
behind
it
would
sail
majestically
through
the
air
from
the
mainland
it
would
be
a
very
fishy
place
if
we
could
get
near
remarked
miss
hardy
all
the
ground
underneath
the
nests
would
be
strewn
with
bones
and
remains
the
herons
fly
a
tremendous
long
way
in
search
of
food
sometimes
a
radius
of
as
much
as
forty
miles
look
there
one
fishing
in
the
lake
over
there
i
like
the
whitethroats
best
said
dulcie
i
should
care
to
hold
a
young
heron
in
my
hand
and
cuddle
it
at
the
lower
end
of
the
lake
was
a
and
down
the
slopes
sir
ranald
had
caused
to
be
planted
a
little
forest
of
rhododendrons
they
were
in
their
prime
and
stretched
a
beautiful
mass
of
every
shade
from
crimson
to
pink
and
lavender
on
the
top
of
the
hill
was
a
a
building
with
pillars
and
steps
and
here
by
arrangement
they
expected
the
wife
to
supply
them
with
boiling
water
for
their
tea
it
looked
an
ideal
place
for
a
picnic
and
they
started
at
once
to
climb
the
steep
path
that
led
among
the
rhododendrons
to
the
summit
up
and
up
under
the
screen
of
delicate
blossom
they
felt
as
if
they
were
treading
in
some
tropical
garden
and
when
they
reached
the
summit
and
the
view
burst
upon
them
of
slope
gleaming
lake
and
flecked
blue
sky
they
stood
gazing
with
much
satisfaction
the
temple
as
the
girls
called
the
was
a
classic
building
with
a
terrace
in
front
and
here
the
school
elected
to
sit
instead
of
in
the
rather
cramped
room
there
was
a
kitchen
at
the
back
and
bates
the
wife
had
lighted
a
fire
and
boiled
kettles
in
readiness
for
them
sir
ranald
and
his
friends
come
for
lunch
here
sometimes
in
the
shooting
season
she
explained
so
i
used
to
getting
tea
and
coffee
made
take
some
chairs
outside
if
you
like
you
rather
sit
on
the
steps
well
there
no
accounting
for
tastes
give
me
your
teapots
and
i
warm
them
before
you
put
the
tea
into
them
sitting
in
a
row
on
the
steps
that
led
from
the
temple
to
the
terrace
the
girls
had
a
glorious
view
carmel
in
especial
seemed
particularly
to
enjoy
herself
it
more
like
home
than
anything
i
seen
yet
she
declared
enthusiastically
i
could
almost
fancy
that
this
little
piazza
is
on
the
slope
of
etna
the
goatherds
ought
to
be
playing
the
down
there
i
can
nearly
hear
them
what
the
asked
dulcie
it
the
sicilian
national
dance
every
body
dances
it
sometimes
by
sunlight
and
sometimes
by
moonlight
oh
it
a
thing
that
gets
into
your
blood
once
you
hear
it
played
on
the
pipes
you
have
to
jump
up
and
dance
you
simply
ca
help
it
there
magic
in
it
dance
it
for
us
now
on
the
terrace
suggested
dulcie
i
no
music
ca
you
hum
it
miss
walters
may
carmel
show
us
a
sicilian
dance
by
all
means
if
she
will
acquiesced
the
go
on
carmel
commanded
the
girls
show
us
how
it
goes
thus
urged
carmel
rose
from
her
seat
and
went
on
to
the
terrace
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
she
looked
for
a
moment
or
two
at
the
crimson
slope
of
flowers
and
the
shining
lake
as
if
to
put
herself
into
the
right
mental
atmosphere
then
humming
a
lively
but
haunting
tune
she
began
her
southern
dance
it
was
wonderful
dancing
every
action
of
her
alert
young
body
was
so
beautifully
graceful
that
you
forgot
her
modern
costume
and
could
imagine
her
a
nymph
in
classic
draperies
her
arms
kept
motion
with
her
tripping
feet
and
both
were
in
time
with
the
tune
that
she
was
trilling
it
seemed
a
spontaneous
expression
of
gaiety
as
natural
as
the
flight
of
a
or
the
sporting
of
a
kitten
her
dark
hair
flew
out
behind
her
her
eyes
shone
and
sparkled
and
her
cheeks
flushed
with
unwonted
color
for
the
moment
she
looked
the
very
incarnation
of
joy
and
might
have
been
artemis
surprised
in
a
sicilian
grove
it
was
such
a
fresh
aspect
of
carmel
that
the
girls
stared
at
her
in
amazement
from
princess
she
had
changed
to
oread
and
they
did
not
know
her
in
this
new
mood
they
gave
her
performance
a
hearty
clap
however
as
she
stopped
and
sank
panting
on
to
the
steps
you
have
to
turn
carmel
and
give
the
others
a
lesson
in
your
pastorale
said
miss
walters
it
a
pretty
step
and
we
shall
ask
you
to
do
it
again
when
we
give
our
garden
fête
in
aid
of
the
and
strays
do
you
think
our
english
scenery
can
compare
favorably
even
with
your
beloved
sicily
it
very
beautiful
admitted
carmel
but
i
miss
etna
in
the
distance
then
you
wo
yield
us
the
palm
laughed
miss
walters
i
love
it
all
i
do
indeed
but
sicily
will
always
be
the
most
beautiful
place
in
the
world
to
me
because
it
home
chapter
vii
an
old
greek
idyll
after
the
picnic
at
bradstone
carmel
possibly
from
something
she
heard
the
girls
say
about
her
seemed
to
make
a
supreme
effort
to
overcome
her
homesickness
and
to
settle
down
as
an
ordinary
and
rational
member
of
the
school
she
was
undoubtedly
a
favorite
even
lilias
admitted
her
charm
though
she
had
not
fallen
under
her
spell
so
completely
as
dulcie
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
lilias
could
not
quite
forgive
carmel
for
supplanting
her
brother
at
the
chase
from
the
night
he
had
said
and
motored
to
balderton
not
a
word
had
been
heard
of
everard
he
had
not
returned
to
school
neither
had
he
visited
any
relations
or
friends
and
indeed
since
he
stepped
out
of
the
car
at
the
railway
station
all
trace
of
him
seemed
to
have
vanished
bowden
did
not
take
the
matter
too
seriously
he
considered
everard
was
more
of
a
man
now
than
a
schoolboy
and
that
if
he
had
fulfilled
his
threat
of
running
away
to
sea
the
brief
experience
of
a
voyage
before
the
mast
would
do
him
no
harm
and
that
when
the
vessel
returned
to
port
he
would
probably
be
only
too
glad
to
come
back
and
claim
his
share
of
the
inheritance
this
easy
view
annoyed
lilias
she
had
a
share
of
the
ingleton
pride
and
she
would
have
liked
his
absence
treated
with
more
concern
she
thought
bowden
ought
to
advertise
in
the
agony
column
of
beseeching
everard
to
return
home
but
their
guardian
only
laughed
when
she
suggested
such
a
course
and
assured
her
that
her
brother
would
turn
up
in
time
when
he
was
tired
of
managing
for
himself
i
been
in
the
law
for
thirty
years
my
dear
and
i
know
human
nature
better
than
you
do
he
declared
indulgently
but
you
do
know
everard
as
i
do
protested
lilias
she
could
not
take
bowden
view
of
the
case
everard
had
left
the
chase
in
such
deep
anger
and
resentment
that
the
chances
of
a
speedy
change
in
his
outlook
seemed
remote
lilias
longed
to
write
to
him
but
knew
of
no
address
to
which
it
was
possible
to
post
a
letter
she
worried
often
over
his
mysterious
absence
and
was
quite
angry
with
dulcie
for
not
taking
the
matter
more
keenly
to
heart
but
bowden
and
cousin
clare
think
he
all
right
protested
that
easy
going
young
damsel
how
do
they
know
i
think
you
might
show
a
little
more
interest
in
your
own
brother
who
after
all
has
been
treated
extremely
badly
it
seems
to
me
hardly
decent
to
circle
round
carmel
as
you
do
dulcie
opened
her
blue
eyes
wide
do
i
circle
round
carmel
well
really
and
why
should
i
like
her
she
my
cousin
and
a
jolly
good
sort
too
i
believe
she
give
us
all
a
far
better
time
at
the
chase
than
everard
would
have
done
he
always
wanted
everything
just
his
own
way
none
of
us
ever
had
an
innings
when
he
was
at
home
i
never
could
see
why
the
eldest
of
a
family
should
lord
it
so
over
the
others
you
never
had
any
proper
sense
of
propriety
retorted
lilias
indignantly
believe
in
keeping
up
the
traditions
of
the
ingletons
and
the
estate
has
always
descended
strictly
in
the
male
line
it
only
right
it
should
have
been
left
to
everard
instead
of
to
a
girl
and
always
say
so
there
dulcie
shrugged
her
shoulders
say
what
you
like
sister
o
mine
the
twentieth
century
is
different
from
the
middle
ages
and
people
do
bother
so
much
nowadays
as
they
did
about
descent
and
all
that
the
owner
of
an
estate
has
to
fight
for
it
oh
yes
of
course
i
glad
i
an
ingleton
but
carmel
an
ingleton
too
as
much
as
we
are
and
if
the
chase
is
hers
we
ca
help
it
and
we
may
just
as
well
make
the
best
of
it
with
which
piece
of
philosophy
dulcie
turned
away
leaving
lilias
to
shake
her
head
over
the
decay
of
family
feeling
and
the
degeneracy
of
younger
sisters
it
was
perhaps
carmel
rendering
of
the
pastorale
dance
that
suggested
to
miss
walters
a
scheme
of
entertainment
for
the
garden
fête
which
the
girls
were
to
give
in
aid
of
the
homes
for
waifs
and
strays
she
decided
that
the
garden
of
chilcombe
hall
would
make
an
excellent
background
for
some
classic
representations
and
that
nothing
could
be
prettier
than
old
greek
costumes
by
a
stroke
of
great
good
luck
she
managed
to
engage
miss
adams
a
former
pupil
who
had
been
studying
classic
dancing
in
paris
to
come
for
a
few
weeks
and
train
the
performers
miss
adams
was
a
tremendous
enthusiast
and
arrived
full
of
ideas
which
she
was
burning
to
teach
to
the
school
the
girls
were
delighted
with
her
methods
it
was
quite
a
new
phase
of
dancing
to
trip
barefooted
on
the
lawn
holding
up
garlands
of
flowers
they
liked
the
exercises
which
she
gave
them
for
the
cultivation
of
grace
and
practised
classic
attitudes
on
all
occasions
with
more
or
less
success
you
go
about
the
school
so
exactly
like
minerva
complained
noreen
to
phillida
rather
dismayed
by
the
sudden
change
in
her
lively
friend
from
bounding
spirits
to
a
statuesque
pose
need
you
always
walk
as
if
you
were
thinking
of
the
shape
of
your
ankles
phillida
shook
her
head
carefully
so
as
not
to
disarrange
the
greek
fillet
she
was
wearing
it
been
too
hot
lately
to
tear
round
and
play
tennis
i
think
too
that
what
miss
adams
says
is
quite
right
english
girls
lacking
in
grace
and
dignity
just
look
at
the
way
ida
and
joyce
are
flopping
about
now
an
artist
would
have
fits
to
see
them
well
of
course
they
not
sitting
for
their
portraits
oh
yes
i
love
dancing
but
i
do
want
to
worry
about
being
graceful
all
day
long
that
just
the
point
though
persisted
phillida
who
was
a
zealous
convert
the
dances
are
to
make
you
graceful
you
so
get
into
the
poetry
of
motion
that
it
quite
impossible
for
you
ever
to
flop
again
is
it
oh
kafoozalum
burbled
noreen
exploding
into
a
series
of
chuckles
never
flopped
again
we
ought
to
make
a
parody
on
that
from
the
poem
of
white
ship
miss
adams
to
the
school
came
down
the
classic
wave
rolled
on
and
what
was
cricket
latest
score
to
those
who
danced
alone
from
dawn
they
practised
attitudes
until
the
sun
did
wane
and
fast
confirmed
in
grecian
pose
they
never
flopped
again
you
may
mock
as
much
as
you
please
retorted
phillida
but
it
sheer
envy
because
you
know
you
wo
be
chosen
as
a
wood
nymph
play
cricket
and
tennis
if
you
wish
by
all
means
but
think
when
we
having
a
performance
we
may
just
as
well
give
our
minds
to
it
and
do
it
properly
especially
when
miss
adams
is
here
to
teach
us
right
you
are
float
on
o
goddess
you
getting
too
ethereal
for
the
school
i
shall
be
glad
when
the
entertainment
over
and
we
can
have
a
cricket
match
again
it
decidedly
more
in
my
line
miss
adams
with
all
the
enthusiasm
of
youth
and
a
new
vocation
was
determined
to
make
the
entertainment
a
success
she
spared
no
trouble
over
constant
rehearsals
and
having
weeded
out
those
girls
who
could
not
adapt
themselves
to
her
methods
she
kept
the
rest
well
at
work
in
any
time
that
was
available
she
determined
not
only
to
have
dances
but
to
give
in
addition
a
short
greek
play
and
selected
for
that
purpose
the
famous
fifteenth
idyll
of
theocritus
but
we
not
to
act
it
in
greek
surely
objected
edith
in
alarm
it
bad
enough
to
have
to
learn
french
plays
we
never
be
able
to
tackle
greek
urged
dulcie
absolutely
aghast
do
look
so
scared
laughed
miss
adams
i
not
going
to
ask
you
to
give
it
in
greek
probably
few
people
would
understand
it
if
you
did
i
have
a
delightful
translation
here
it
ought
to
take
very
well
indeed
with
the
audience
come
and
squat
on
the
grass
and
i
read
it
aloud
to
you
first
and
then
i
allot
parts
is
it
stiff
and
educational
groaned
dulcie
obeying
unwillingly
wait
and
see
come
under
the
shade
of
the
lilac
bush
it
so
hot
to
sit
in
the
sun
the
girls
composed
themselves
into
attitudes
of
more
or
less
classic
elegance
and
miss
adams
book
in
hand
began
to
read
idyll
xv
is
praxinoë
at
home
dear
gorgo
how
long
it
is
since
you
have
been
here
she
at
home
the
wonder
is
that
you
have
got
here
at
last
eunoë
see
that
she
has
a
chair
throw
a
cushion
on
it
too
it
does
most
charmingly
as
it
is
do
sit
down
oh
what
a
thing
spirit
is
i
have
scarcely
got
to
you
alive
praxinoë
what
a
huge
crowd
what
hosts
of
everywhere
cavalry
boots
everywhere
men
in
uniform
and
the
road
is
endless
yes
you
really
live
far
away
it
is
all
the
fault
of
that
madman
of
mine
here
he
came
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
and
took
a
hole
not
a
house
and
all
that
we
might
not
be
neighbors
the
jealous
wretch
always
the
same
ever
for
spite
do
talk
of
dinon
your
husband
like
that
my
dear
girl
before
the
little
boy
look
how
he
is
staring
at
you
never
mind
zopyrion
sweet
child
she
is
not
speaking
about
papa
our
lady
persephone
the
child
takes
notice
nice
papa
that
papa
of
his
the
other
day
we
call
every
day
other
day
went
to
get
soap
and
rouge
at
the
shop
and
back
he
came
to
me
with
salt
the
great
big
endless
fellow
but
miss
adams
interrupted
dulcie
surely
this
is
an
old
greek
play
it
sounds
absolutely
and
entirely
modern
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
written
by
theocritus
about
the
year
it
describes
the
visit
paid
by
two
syracusan
ladies
residing
in
alexandria
to
the
festival
of
adonis
their
manners
and
talk
then
must
have
been
very
similar
to
ours
of
listen
to
the
part
where
they
are
getting
ready
to
start
it
seems
nearly
time
to
go
idlers
have
always
holidays
eunoë
bring
the
water
and
put
it
down
in
the
middle
of
the
room
lazy
creature
that
you
are
cats
always
like
to
sleep
soft
come
bustle
bring
the
water
quicker
i
want
water
first
and
how
she
carries
it
give
it
me
all
the
same
do
pour
out
so
much
you
extravagant
thing
stupid
girl
why
are
you
wetting
my
dress
there
stop
i
have
washed
my
hands
as
heaven
would
have
it
where
is
the
key
of
the
big
chest
bring
it
here
praxinoë
that
full
body
becomes
you
wonderfully
tell
me
how
much
did
the
stuff
cost
you
just
off
the
loom
do
speak
of
it
gorgo
more
than
eight
pounds
in
good
silver
money
and
the
work
on
it
i
nearly
slaved
my
soul
out
over
it
well
it
is
successful
all
you
could
wish
thanks
for
the
pretty
speech
eunoë
bring
my
shawl
and
set
my
hat
on
my
head
the
fashionable
way
no
zopyrion
i
mean
to
take
boo
bogies
there
a
horse
that
bites
cry
as
much
as
you
please
but
i
can
not
have
you
lamed
let
us
be
moving
phrygia
take
the
child
and
keep
him
amused
call
in
the
dog
and
shut
the
street
door
it
exactly
like
anybody
going
out
commented
carmel
as
miss
adams
came
to
a
pause
why
does
it
seem
so
modern
asked
dulcie
because
it
was
written
during
the
zenith
of
greece
history
and
one
great
civilization
always
resembles
another
england
of
is
far
more
in
touch
with
the
times
of
ancient
egypt
babylon
greece
and
rome
than
with
the
middle
ages
read
chaucer
and
you
find
his
mental
outlook
is
that
of
a
child
of
seven
in
the
days
of
the
plantagenets
grown
men
and
women
enjoyed
stories
of
a
crude
simplicity
that
now
only
appeals
to
children
the
human
race
is
always
progressing
in
great
successive
waves
of
civilization
after
each
wave
breaks
a
time
of
barbarism
prevails
till
man
is
again
educated
to
a
higher
growth
we
living
at
the
top
of
a
wave
at
present
i
remember
said
carmel
when
mother
and
daddy
took
me
to
rome
we
saw
the
busts
of
the
emperors
and
of
all
sorts
of
clever
people
lived
in
about
the
first
century
and
we
all
said
are
their
faces
just
like
people
of
we
amused
ourselves
with
saying
one
was
a
lawyer
and
another
a
doctor
and
calling
some
of
them
after
our
friends
then
we
went
afterwards
to
an
exhibition
of
portraits
perhaps
the
artists
had
learnt
to
paint
well
but
at
any
rate
the
faces
were
utterly
different
from
people
of
they
seemed
quite
another
type
altogether
not
so
intelligent
or
so
interesting
we
were
tremendously
struck
with
the
difference
it
marks
my
point
said
miss
adams
what
else
do
gorgo
and
praxinoë
do
asked
edith
they
go
into
alexandria
for
the
festival
and
find
the
streets
so
crowded
that
they
are
almost
frightened
to
death
and
have
hard
work
not
to
lose
eunoë
the
slave
girl
whom
they
have
taken
with
them
she
nearly
gets
squeezed
as
they
pass
in
at
the
door
they
go
into
raptures
over
an
exhibition
of
embroideries
athene
says
praxinoë
wrought
them
what
painters
designed
their
drawings
so
true
they
are
i
have
time
to
read
it
all
to
you
now
but
i
must
just
give
you
the
little
bit
where
they
quarrel
with
a
stranger
too
absolutely
priceless
you
weariful
women
do
cease
your
endless
cooing
talk
you
bore
one
to
death
with
your
eternal
broad
vowels
indeed
and
where
may
this
person
come
from
what
is
it
to
you
if
we
chatterboxes
give
orders
to
your
own
servants
sir
do
you
pretend
to
command
ladies
of
syracuse
if
you
must
know
we
are
corinthians
by
descent
like
bellerophon
himself
and
we
speak
peloponnesian
dorian
women
may
lawfully
speak
doric
i
presume
oh
let
me
be
gorgo
begged
dulcie
i
love
her
she
so
smart
and
sarcastic
is
it
exactly
like
somebody
talking
during
a
concert
and
a
person
in
the
row
in
front
objecting
and
a
friend
butting
in
with
rude
remarks
that
what
generally
happens
did
people
accent
matter
in
greek
as
much
as
it
does
in
english
asked
prissie
evidently
the
alexandrian
gentleman
who
sounds
a
decided
fop
did
not
approve
of
a
doric
pronunciation
no
doubt
broad
vowels
were
out
of
fashion
i
believe
i
shall
give
his
part
to
edith
it
a
small
one
but
it
has
scope
for
a
good
deal
of
acting
and
who
is
to
be
praxinoë
please
i
think
i
must
choose
carmel
she
ought
to
act
in
an
idyll
by
theocritus
as
he
was
a
sicilian
like
herself
would
he
find
sicily
much
altered
carmel
if
he
came
back
or
is
it
the
same
after
two
thousand
years
there
are
still
goatherds
on
the
mountains
though
we
do
see
wood
nymphs
now
no
the
wood
nymphs
have
all
trotted
over
to
england
and
are
going
to
give
a
performance
in
aid
of
the
and
strays
said
dulcie
i
hope
apollo
will
remember
them
and
send
them
a
fine
day
if
anything
to
do
with
the
weather
over
here
perhaps
his
sun
chariot
only
runs
on
the
mediterranean
route
surely
he
got
an
aeroplane
by
now
laughed
edith
we
send
him
a
wireless
message
to
remind
him
of
his
duty
dancing
thursday
week
at
kindly
cable
special
supply
of
sunshine
now
girls
you
getting
silly
said
miss
adams
shutting
her
book
and
rising
if
we
want
to
make
a
success
of
our
classic
afternoon
we
plenty
of
hard
work
before
us
i
going
on
with
costumes
at
present
and
anybody
who
cares
to
volunteer
can
fetch
her
thimble
and
a
needle
and
cotton
and
hem
a
chiton
chapter
viii
wood
nymphs
it
needed
a
tremendous
amount
of
rehearsing
and
preparation
before
miss
adams
judged
her
classic
performance
fit
for
public
exhibition
the
greek
garments
simple
as
they
were
nevertheless
required
sewing
and
there
were
certain
pieces
of
scenery
to
be
constructed
the
other
mistresses
helped
nobly
though
they
were
thankful
to
be
spared
the
organization
of
the
proceedings
and
to
leave
the
brunt
of
the
burden
to
a
specialist
tickets
for
the
entertainment
had
been
sold
in
the
neighborhood
and
parents
and
friends
of
the
girls
who
lived
within
motoring
distance
had
promised
to
drive
over
cousin
clare
is
coming
rejoiced
dulcie
she
has
two
friends
staying
at
the
chase
and
she
bring
them
with
her
if
milner
drives
them
i
shall
ask
miss
walters
if
he
may
come
and
watch
too
he
be
delighted
to
see
it
he
loves
anything
of
that
kind
his
own
little
girl
was
may
queen
at
the
village
pageant
two
years
ago
and
he
talked
about
it
ever
since
i
wrote
to
bowden
said
lilias
and
he
taken
two
tickets
but
he
doubtful
if
he
find
time
to
get
off
he
always
so
busy
never
mind
if
he
sent
the
money
for
them
consoled
edith
of
course
it
nice
to
have
big
audiences
but
it
money
we
out
for
we
want
to
make
a
decent
sum
miss
walters
says
the
tickets
have
sold
quite
well
even
if
it
a
doubtful
day
and
we
do
have
a
very
big
audience
we
shall
clear
something
at
any
rate
oh
but
i
do
hope
people
will
come
it
so
disappointing
to
take
all
this
trouble
and
to
act
to
rows
of
empty
chairs
what
going
to
happen
by
the
by
if
it
a
wet
day
will
it
be
put
off
we
shall
have
to
have
it
in
the
big
schoolroom
it
ca
be
put
off
because
miss
adams
can
only
stay
till
friday
and
we
could
get
through
it
without
her
no
indeed
she
the
directing
genius
of
it
all
oh
dear
it
simply
keep
fine
never
was
weather
more
carefully
watched
all
the
old
country
saws
and
superstitions
were
remembered
and
repeated
it
became
a
matter
of
vital
importance
to
notice
whether
the
scarlet
pimpernel
was
out
if
the
cattle
were
grazing
with
their
heads
up
hill
and
whether
a
heron
flew
across
the
sky
prissie
took
a
candle
into
the
garden
last
thing
before
to
observe
if
the
lawn
showed
earthworms
the
finding
of
black
slugs
was
considered
to
be
rather
fatal
and
the
hooting
of
owls
a
decidedly
bad
omen
the
goddess
of
the
english
climate
however
is
such
a
fickle
deity
that
there
is
never
the
least
dependence
to
be
placed
on
weather
prophecies
she
always
seems
to
prefer
to
give
a
surprise
on
the
day
before
the
performance
it
rained
evening
closed
in
with
a
stormy
sky
and
every
probability
of
waking
next
morning
to
find
a
drizzle
dulcie
putting
her
head
out
of
the
window
last
thing
reported
driving
clouds
and
a
total
absence
of
stars
yet
lo
and
behold
they
woke
to
one
of
those
rare
ethereal
dawns
that
come
only
now
and
then
in
a
summer
the
blue
bedroom
faced
east
and
over
the
line
of
laurels
in
the
garden
they
could
watch
pearl
and
opal
flush
into
rosy
pink
before
the
sun
shone
out
in
an
almost
cloudless
sky
by
nine
the
wet
grass
of
yesterday
was
beginning
to
dry
up
and
miss
adams
with
the
help
of
jones
the
gardener
was
setting
up
her
scenery
and
making
initial
arrangements
for
the
business
of
the
afternoon
she
had
contrived
her
theater
as
far
as
possible
on
greek
lines
there
was
no
stage
but
the
audience
sat
on
chairs
on
the
grass
and
on
cushions
and
rugs
placed
down
a
bank
that
commanded
the
lawn
the
performance
was
to
begin
at
and
soon
after
visitors
began
to
arrive
there
was
quite
a
long
row
of
cars
in
the
drive
bicycles
were
stacked
against
the
veranda
and
two
ponies
were
put
up
in
the
stable
cousin
clare
and
her
friends
came
in
excellent
time
driven
much
to
dulcie
satisfaction
by
milner
who
in
company
with
the
other
chauffeurs
received
a
cordial
invitation
from
miss
walters
to
witness
the
show
and
was
it
nice
of
him
said
dulcie
to
carmel
he
insisted
on
giving
a
shilling
to
the
funds
i
told
him
it
was
expected
but
he
said
he
should
to
if
we
did
mind
mind
why
we
want
all
the
money
we
can
get
i
think
milner
is
an
old
dear
agreed
carmel
bowden
had
actually
managed
to
get
away
from
his
office
after
all
and
had
brought
a
niece
with
him
in
the
of
his
he
looked
quite
beaming
as
if
he
meant
to
forget
the
law
for
a
few
hours
and
to
enjoy
himself
he
sat
next
to
cousin
clare
chatting
affably
and
admiring
the
arrangements
a
piano
had
been
carried
out
on
to
the
lawn
for
the
occasion
and
miss
lowe
the
music
mistress
took
her
seat
at
it
she
was
supported
by
a
small
school
orchestra
of
three
violins
and
violoncello
and
together
they
struck
up
some
eastern
music
when
it
was
well
started
there
was
a
flashing
of
white
among
the
bushes
on
the
farther
side
of
the
lawn
and
out
came
tripping
a
bevy
of
charming
wood
nymphs
they
were
all
clad
in
greek
chitons
very
delicately
draped
their
hair
was
bound
with
gold
fillets
and
their
arms
and
feet
were
bare
they
held
aloft
garlands
of
flowers
and
circling
on
that
part
of
the
lawn
which
formed
the
stage
they
went
through
the
postures
of
a
beautiful
and
intricate
classic
dance
viewed
against
the
background
of
trees
and
bushes
it
was
a
remarkably
pretty
performance
there
were
no
accessories
of
limelight
or
to
give
a
theatrical
or
artificial
effect
the
afternoon
sunshine
fell
on
the
girls
in
their
simple
costumes
and
showed
a
most
natural
scene
as
their
bare
feet
whirled
lightly
over
the
grass
in
time
to
the
music
and
their
uplifted
arms
waved
the
long
garlands
there
was
a
tremendous
clapping
as
they
retired
into
the
shelter
of
their
classic
groves
the
next
item
on
miss
adams
program
was
rather
ambitious
an
upright
screen
of
wood
covered
with
black
paper
was
placed
upon
the
lawn
to
serve
as
a
background
and
in
front
of
this
hester
wilson
and
truie
tyndale
attired
in
venetian
red
chitons
performed
a
grecian
dance
the
effect
was
exactly
a
representation
of
an
ancient
etruscan
vase
with
terra
cotta
figures
on
a
black
background
and
when
at
the
end
they
stood
posed
as
in
a
tableau
the
likeness
was
complete
though
scarcely
so
pretty
as
the
garland
dance
it
was
considered
very
clever
and
met
with
much
applause
for
the
idyll
xv
of
theocritus
miss
adams
had
followed
greek
tradition
and
had
used
only
the
scantiest
and
simplest
of
scenery
a
few
screens
and
stools
did
service
for
a
house
a
rug
was
flung
on
the
grass
and
a
brass
waterpot
brought
by
miss
walters
from
cairo
completed
the
idea
of
a
classic
establishment
it
was
better
to
have
few
accessories
than
to
present
anachronisms
and
place
modern
articles
in
an
alexandrian
home
of
the
third
century
dulcie
and
carmel
as
gorgo
and
praxinoë
made
an
excellent
contrast
the
one
carrying
out
the
fair
greek
type
and
the
other
the
dark
they
played
their
parts
admirably
rendering
the
dialogue
with
much
spirit
and
brightness
and
with
appropriate
action
praxinoë
the
fashionable
belle
of
the
third
century
donned
her
garments
for
the
festival
with
a
mixture
of
coquetry
and
greek
dignity
that
delighted
the
audience
gorgo
passage
of
arms
with
the
stranger
of
alexandria
was
smart
and
racy
while
edith
as
the
affected
of
the
period
was
considered
a
huge
success
as
nobody
in
the
school
was
young
enough
to
take
zopyrion
they
had
borrowed
the
baby
and
had
trained
him
to
walk
on
holding
the
hand
of
eunoë
he
was
a
pretty
child
and
dressed
in
a
little
white
chiton
with
bare
legs
and
feet
he
looked
very
charming
and
quite
completed
the
scene
his
round
wondering
eyes
and
evident
astonishment
were
indeed
exactly
what
was
required
from
him
to
sustain
the
part
the
wood
nymphs
with
some
slight
additions
of
costume
acted
the
crowd
through
which
gorgo
and
praxinoë
had
to
push
their
way
and
pilot
their
slaves
they
pushed
and
hustled
with
such
vigor
as
amply
to
justify
the
episode
where
praxinoë
muslin
veil
was
torn
in
two
and
the
whole
party
would
have
been
separated
and
eunoë
altogether
lost
but
for
the
help
of
an
alexandrian
gentleman
carmel
brought
out
her
speech
of
thanks
with
much
unction
both
this
year
and
for
ever
may
all
be
well
with
you
my
dear
sir
for
your
care
of
us
a
good
kind
man
we
letting
eunoë
get
squeezed
come
wretched
girl
push
your
way
through
and
nesta
as
the
courteous
stranger
responded
with
a
bow
which
if
not
absolutely
historically
correct
for
the
period
was
certainly
a
combination
of
the
good
manners
of
all
the
ages
as
it
was
difficult
to
find
enough
items
for
an
entirely
classical
program
the
second
half
of
the
entertainment
was
to
be
miscellaneous
and
during
the
short
interval
a
delegate
from
the
waifs
and
strays
society
was
to
give
a
short
address
explaining
the
work
of
the
homes
now
carmel
was
down
in
part
ii
to
dance
the
pastorale
and
she
ran
into
the
house
to
change
her
greek
chiton
for
the
dress
of
a
sicilian
peasant
she
went
through
the
veranda
and
the
open
french
window
and
straight
upstairs
to
her
bedroom
she
had
brought
nobody
with
her
because
for
one
thing
she
needed
no
help
and
for
another
she
was
hot
and
excited
and
felt
that
she
would
like
a
few
minutes
rest
quite
to
herself
there
was
no
great
hurry
so
she
leisurely
put
on
the
pretty
scarlet
and
skirt
the
velvet
apron
the
white
bodice
and
laced
corsage
clasped
the
necklace
round
her
throat
and
twisted
the
gay
silk
handkerchief
as
a
on
her
dark
hair
it
was
a
prettier
and
more
effective
costume
even
than
the
greek
one
there
was
an
eastern
variety
of
color
in
it
that
suited
her
better
than
the
simplicity
of
the
chiton
she
had
completed
it
from
the
gold
bangles
on
her
wrists
to
the
scarlet
stockings
and
neat
shoes
and
was
just
turning
to
run
downstairs
again
when
she
suddenly
stopped
and
listened
carmel
little
bedroom
was
really
a
and
possessed
two
doors
one
led
into
the
passage
and
the
other
communicated
with
the
blue
bedroom
this
latter
door
was
ajar
just
a
couple
of
inches
and
through
the
opening
came
the
sound
of
a
drawer
pulled
out
for
a
moment
carmel
thought
that
dulcie
and
bertha
must
have
come
upstairs
and
she
was
on
the
point
of
calling
to
them
when
some
strong
and
mysterious
instinct
restrained
her
instead
she
walked
softly
across
the
floor
and
peeped
through
the
chink
it
was
no
cousin
or
schoolfellow
who
was
in
the
next
room
but
a
slight
fair
man
an
utter
stranger
who
was
hastily
turning
over
the
contents
of
the
drawer
and
slipping
something
into
his
pocket
for
a
moment
carmel
heart
stood
still
she
realized
instantly
that
she
was
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
a
burglar
seeing
the
entertainment
advertised
by
a
placard
on
the
gate
he
must
have
entered
the
garden
and
waited
his
opportunity
to
slip
into
the
house
while
everybody
was
outside
watching
the
performance
he
was
apparently
laying
light
fingers
upon
any
article
which
took
his
fancy
carmel
first
and
most
natural
impulse
was
to
tear
downstairs
and
give
warning
of
what
was
happening
then
it
occurred
to
her
that
while
she
did
so
the
thief
would
very
possibly
make
his
escape
if
only
she
could
trap
him
but
how
her
fertile
brain
thought
for
a
second
or
two
then
evolved
a
plan
very
quietly
she
withdrew
the
key
from
the
door
which
led
out
of
her
bedroom
to
the
passage
and
locked
it
on
the
outside
so
far
so
good
if
burglar
went
into
the
he
could
not
escape
now
she
must
be
prepared
to
take
a
great
risk
the
key
of
the
blue
bedroom
was
on
the
inside
she
must
open
the
door
withdraw
it
and
lock
it
on
the
outside
before
the
thief
could
stop
her
it
was
possible
that
he
had
calculated
on
the
double
exit
and
that
hearing
a
noise
behind
him
he
would
make
a
dash
for
the
with
shaking
legs
and
something
going
round
and
round
like
a
wheel
inside
her
chest
she
approached
the
blue
bedroom
door
and
opened
it
softly
as
she
had
anticipated
the
intruder
had
probably
laid
his
plans
for
at
the
first
sound
he
turned
his
head
then
slipped
like
a
rabbit
into
the
no
doubt
an
unpleasant
surprise
awaited
him
there
for
as
carmel
trembling
fingers
drew
out
the
key
and
locked
the
door
from
the
passage
side
she
could
hear
the
handle
of
her
own
bedroom
door
moving
he
probably
got
skeleton
keys
or
a
jemmy
or
something
like
they
use
on
the
cinema
and
will
be
out
in
a
minute
but
i
get
a
start
of
him
she
thought
and
tearing
down
stairs
like
the
wind
she
literally
flew
into
the
garden
and
gasped
forth
the
thrilling
news
it
the
blue
bedroom
watch
the
window
or
he
may
jump
out
she
added
quickly
there
was
an
instant
rush
towards
the
house
miss
walters
with
milner
and
four
other
chauffeurs
to
support
her
dashed
up
stairs
bowden
and
a
crowd
of
visitors
took
their
stand
under
the
windows
shouts
from
the
bedroom
presently
announced
that
the
burglar
had
been
secured
and
after
a
while
he
was
led
down
stairs
with
his
wrists
fastened
together
by
a
piece
of
clothes
line
and
guarded
on
each
side
by
two
determined
looking
men
who
hustled
him
into
a
car
and
drove
him
off
at
once
to
the
police
station
at
glazebrook
the
excitement
at
chilcombe
hall
was
tremendous
it
was
of
course
impossible
to
go
on
with
the
entertainment
mistresses
girls
and
guests
could
do
nothing
but
talk
about
the
occurrence
carmel
was
questioned
and
gave
as
minute
and
accurate
an
account
as
she
could
of
exactly
what
had
happened
she
was
much
congratulated
by
everybody
on
her
presence
of
mind
i
do
know
how
you
dared
do
it
shivered
dulcie
he
might
have
shot
you
with
a
revolver
you
a
brave
girl
said
miss
walters
approvingly
if
it
had
been
for
your
prompt
action
in
all
probability
he
would
have
got
away
i
did
feel
brave
i
was
scared
to
death
admitted
carmel
although
she
would
not
acknowledge
any
particular
credit
in
her
achievement
carmel
was
necessarily
the
heroine
of
the
hour
miss
walters
feeling
that
everybody
must
be
in
need
of
refreshment
after
such
an
event
ordered
tea
to
be
served
immediately
and
soon
the
urns
were
carried
out
into
the
garden
where
tables
had
already
been
set
with
cups
and
saucers
and
plates
of
sandwiches
and
cakes
after
a
short
time
bowden
who
had
accompanied
the
burglar
to
the
police
station
returned
to
report
that
their
prisoner
was
safely
quartered
in
a
cell
and
a
formal
charge
had
been
lodged
against
him
which
in
due
course
of
law
would
lead
to
his
trial
for
the
police
think
he
is
not
an
old
offender
but
some
cyclist
who
was
passing
and
probably
yielded
to
a
sudden
temptation
he
explained
nevertheless
he
get
a
sharp
sentence
for
there
has
been
too
much
of
this
sort
of
thing
going
on
lately
and
the
judges
are
inclined
to
be
very
severe
on
it
and
rightly
too
or
nobody
home
would
be
safe
thank
you
carmel
yes
i
take
another
cup
of
tea
please
and
then
i
want
to
see
you
do
that
sicilian
dance
before
i
set
off
on
my
travels
again
oh
yes
i
not
going
away
without
poor
carmel
was
still
feeling
too
much
upset
to
relish
dancing
but
bowden
pressed
the
point
and
other
guests
joined
their
persuasions
so
finally
it
was
decided
to
give
at
least
a
portion
of
the
second
part
of
the
program
and
the
audience
again
took
their
seats
on
the
lawn
leaving
several
people
however
to
guard
the
house
it
not
likely
there
be
another
burglar
on
the
same
afternoon
still
he
might
have
accomplices
about
said
miss
walters
i
shall
never
feel
really
safe
again
i
afraid
we
shall
all
be
horribly
nervous
for
a
long
time
only
the
most
striking
items
in
part
ii
were
selected
for
performance
as
it
was
growing
late
and
most
of
the
guests
would
soon
have
to
take
their
leave
there
was
an
affecting
tableau
of
the
parting
of
the
widowed
queen
of
edward
iv
from
her
little
son
richard
duke
of
york
a
charming
pageant
of
the
old
street
cries
of
london
in
which
dainty
maidens
in
costumes
appeared
with
bunches
of
sweet
lavender
and
baskets
of
cherry
ripe
and
after
singing
the
appropriate
songs
went
the
round
of
the
audience
and
sold
their
wares
noreen
who
was
the
star
of
the
elocution
class
recited
a
poem
describing
the
sad
experience
of
a
typical
little
waif
and
his
reception
in
the
home
it
was
a
pretty
piece
and
had
been
composed
expressly
for
the
society
by
a
lady
who
often
wrote
for
magazines
then
last
of
all
came
carmel
sicilian
dance
miss
lowe
had
fortunately
been
able
to
obtain
the
score
of
the
pastorale
and
with
music
and
costume
complete
the
performance
was
an
even
greater
success
than
it
had
been
on
the
terrace
at
bradstone
people
clapped
the
little
figure
partly
for
her
charming
dancing
and
partly
for
her
pluck
in
trapping
the
burglar
so
that
altogether
she
received
quite
an
ovation
we
sha
forget
the
and
strays
afternoon
in
a
hurry
said
lilias
as
she
tidied
her
possessions
afterwards
for
it
was
drawer
that
the
burglar
had
turned
upside
down
in
his
search
for
valuables
i
feel
i
want
to
sleep
with
a
revolver
under
my
pillow
if
you
did
i
be
far
more
afraid
of
you
than
of
the
burglar
protested
bertha
i
know
you
let
it
off
at
the
wrong
person
i
suppose
anybody
else
is
likely
to
come
burgling
here
so
you
alarm
yourself
but
if
they
do
miss
wiseacre
then
i
should
turn
them
over
into
the
to
be
dealt
with
at
her
discretion
by
princess
carmel
laughed
bertha
i
believe
equal
to
catching
one
of
them
in
a
mousetrap
if
she
gets
the
opportunity
chapter
ix
the
open
road
it
was
fortunate
for
carmel
that
her
first
experience
of
england
should
come
in
the
spring
and
early
summer
had
she
arrived
straight
from
sunny
sicily
to
face
autumn
rains
or
winter
snows
i
verily
believe
her
courage
would
have
failed
and
she
would
have
written
an
urgent
and
imploring
appeal
to
be
fetched
home
for
the
white
house
that
looked
over
the
blue
waters
of
the
mediterranean
was
still
essentially
home
to
carmel
she
had
been
born
and
bred
in
the
south
and
though
one
half
of
her
was
purely
english
there
was
another
side
that
was
strongly
italian
she
was
deeply
attached
to
all
her
relations
and
friends
in
sicily
and
from
her
point
of
view
it
was
exile
to
live
so
far
away
from
them
the
fact
that
she
was
owner
of
the
chase
was
in
her
estimation
no
compensation
whatever
for
her
banishment
from
casa
bianca
she
made
a
very
sweet
and
gentle
little
heiress
however
as
yet
she
was
mistress
only
in
name
for
during
her
minority
everything
was
left
in
the
hands
of
bowden
and
a
certain
canon
lowe
who
were
guardians
to
all
ingleton
grandchildren
and
kept
the
chase
open
as
a
home
for
them
the
three
girls
returned
there
from
chilcombe
hall
at
the
end
of
the
term
and
were
joined
by
the
younger
boys
from
their
preparatory
school
for
a
week
or
two
they
enjoyed
themselves
in
the
grounds
and
the
park
there
was
much
to
show
carmel
and
she
was
happy
sitting
in
the
garden
or
wandering
in
the
woods
she
soon
made
friends
with
the
people
on
the
estate
the
gamekeeper
children
would
come
running
out
to
meet
her
and
stand
round
smiling
while
she
hunted
in
her
pocket
for
chocolates
milner
little
girl
adored
her
and
even
the
shy
baby
at
the
lodge
waxed
friendly
carmel
was
intensely
fond
of
children
and
the
affection
which
she
had
bestowed
on
younger
brothers
and
sisters
at
home
cropped
out
on
every
occasion
where
her
life
touched
that
of
smaller
people
to
roland
bevis
and
clifford
she
was
a
charming
companion
she
would
go
walks
with
them
in
the
woods
help
them
to
arrange
their
various
collections
of
butterflies
foreign
stamps
and
picture
post
cards
and
play
endless
games
of
draughts
halma
or
bagatelle
you
slave
after
those
boys
as
if
you
were
their
nursery
governess
remarked
lilias
one
day
just
a
little
nettled
that
clifford
ran
instinctively
to
carmel
for
sympathy
instead
of
to
his
sister
i
promised
to
help
them
with
those
caterpillar
boxes
and
so
i
will
if
you
leave
them
i
really
ca
be
bothered
carmel
yielded
instantly
part
of
her
intense
charm
was
the
ready
tact
with
which
she
was
careful
never
to
usurp
the
place
of
any
one
else
she
put
aside
the
muslin
that
was
to
form
covers
for
the
boxes
and
slipped
her
scissors
back
into
the
case
clifford
however
who
was
a
budding
naturalist
and
most
keen
on
collecting
was
highly
disgusted
i
want
my
boxes
he
wailed
i
no
place
to
put
my
caterpillars
when
i
find
them
they
crawl
out
of
the
old
boxes
why
should
carmel
make
me
some
i
know
hers
would
be
beauties
lilias
will
make
you
some
nicer
ones
urged
his
cousin
suppose
we
take
our
butterfly
nets
on
to
the
heath
and
try
to
find
some
you
have
a
really
nice
specimen
you
know
and
i
think
we
might
find
some
moths
on
the
trees
in
the
wood
if
we
look
about
carefully
it
worth
trying
is
it
oh
yes
do
let
us
shall
we
start
now
agreed
clifford
much
mollified
on
the
whole
the
three
girls
got
along
excellently
but
if
there
was
any
hint
at
disturbance
it
generally
arose
from
lilias
whose
pride
would
be
up
in
arms
at
the
most
absurd
trifles
she
was
annoyed
that
carmel
was
asked
to
give
away
the
prizes
at
the
village
sports
and
showed
her
dissatisfaction
so
plainly
that
her
cousin
rather
than
have
any
fuss
solved
the
situation
by
asking
cousin
clare
to
perform
the
ceremony
instead
considerably
to
the
disappointment
of
the
committee
who
had
thought
the
new
heiress
was
the
appropriate
patroness
lilias
and
dulcie
took
diametrically
opposite
views
about
the
chase
the
former
stuck
firmly
to
her
opinion
that
it
ought
to
have
been
everard
that
her
brother
was
an
outcast
and
that
it
was
only
sisterly
feeling
to
resent
seeing
anybody
else
in
his
place
her
attitude
to
carmel
was
almost
as
strong
as
that
of
king
robert
of
sicily
in
longfellow
of
a
wayside
towards
the
angel
who
had
temporarily
usurped
his
throne
dulcie
on
the
contrary
had
always
chafed
against
everard
assumption
of
superiority
and
authority
he
had
been
left
the
same
generous
legacy
as
the
rest
of
the
family
and
had
only
to
come
back
and
claim
his
portion
when
he
wished
if
anybody
was
to
have
the
chase
she
really
preferred
that
it
should
belong
to
carmel
who
never
obtruded
her
rights
and
seemed
ready
for
her
cousins
to
enjoy
the
property
on
an
exact
equality
with
herself
the
two
girls
were
great
friends
they
would
go
out
riding
together
while
lilias
went
shopping
in
the
car
with
cousin
clare
they
practised
duets
and
both
made
crude
attempts
at
sketching
the
house
their
tastes
in
books
and
were
somewhat
similar
and
they
would
sit
in
the
shade
in
the
afternoons
stitching
at
embroidery
and
eating
chocolates
three
weeks
of
the
summer
holidays
passed
rapidly
away
in
this
fashion
carmel
was
glad
to
have
the
opportunity
of
getting
to
know
the
chase
and
admitted
its
attractions
though
her
heart
was
still
in
sicily
towards
the
end
of
august
the
party
broke
up
and
scattered
carmel
had
received
an
invitation
from
english
relations
of
her
stepfather
to
join
them
on
a
motor
tour
the
three
little
boys
were
to
be
taken
to
rooms
at
the
seaside
by
miss
mason
their
late
governess
lilias
and
dulcie
went
to
stay
with
friends
and
cousin
clare
had
arranged
to
attend
a
conference
she
agreed
however
that
when
lilias
and
dulcie
returned
from
their
visit
they
should
go
with
her
in
the
car
for
a
to
tivermouth
to
see
how
the
boys
were
getting
on
if
you
promise
we
may
stay
at
an
hotel
stipulated
lilias
i
would
spend
a
in
rooms
with
those
three
imps
for
the
world
i
like
to
see
them
but
not
at
too
close
quarters
it
quite
improbable
that
their
landlady
would
have
bedrooms
for
us
said
cousin
clare
so
in
any
case
we
should
be
obliged
to
stop
at
an
hotel
in
this
crowded
season
i
shall
engage
rooms
beforehand
hurrah
triumphed
dulcie
who
was
anxious
for
a
experience
i
must
say
i
hate
staying
with
the
boys
near
the
beach
the
always
overflowing
with
their
seaweed
and
other
messes
what
a
joke
if
were
to
turn
up
at
the
hotel
too
said
carmel
i
believe
the
rogers
are
going
down
to
devonshire
i
shall
tell
them
the
date
you
be
at
tivermouth
they
possibly
like
to
meet
you
oh
do
it
would
be
such
fun
agreed
dulcie
we
have
an
absolutely
topping
time
together
persuade
them
as
hard
as
you
can
i
do
my
best
agreed
carmel
as
it
is
impossible
to
follow
the
adventures
of
everybody
we
will
concern
ourselves
particularly
with
the
experiences
of
our
heroine
who
was
to
take
her
first
motor
tour
among
english
scenery
the
party
in
the
comfortable
rover
car
consisted
of
major
and
rogers
their
daughter
sheila
their
guest
carmel
and
a
chauffeur
major
rogers
was
still
suffering
from
the
effects
of
wounds
and
was
more
or
less
of
a
a
condition
which
made
him
fussy
at
times
and
too
independent
at
others
for
directly
he
felt
a
trifle
better
he
would
immediately
begin
to
break
all
the
rules
that
the
doctors
had
laid
down
for
his
treatment
he
was
an
amusing
humorous
sort
of
man
who
would
jest
between
spasms
of
pain
and
generally
found
something
to
laugh
at
in
the
various
episodes
of
their
journey
there
is
a
laughter
though
that
is
more
the
expression
of
supreme
courage
than
of
genuine
mirth
and
the
drawn
lines
round
the
major
mouth
told
of
sleepless
nights
and
days
of
little
ease
and
of
trouble
that
hurts
worse
even
than
physical
pain
for
one
son
lay
on
a
belgian
another
on
the
heights
near
salonika
with
no
cross
to
mark
the
grave
and
a
third
deep
under
the
surging
waters
of
the
atlantic
rogers
was
greville
sister
and
for
that
reason
though
she
was
no
real
relation
carmel
called
her
aunt
hilda
she
had
been
a
belle
in
her
youth
and
she
was
still
pretty
with
the
pathetic
beauty
that
often
shines
in
the
faces
of
those
who
have
suffered
great
loss
her
once
flaxen
hair
was
almost
entirely
gray
but
she
had
kept
her
delicate
complexion
and
there
was
a
gentle
sweetness
about
her
that
was
very
attractive
her
daughter
was
an
exact
replica
of
what
she
herself
must
have
been
at
nineteen
though
sheila
was
going
through
an
uncomfortable
phase
and
affected
to
despise
the
country
to
be
nervous
of
motoring
and
to
long
to
be
back
in
town
again
she
was
quite
kind
to
carmel
but
treated
her
with
the
distantly
indulgent
attitude
of
the
for
the
mere
schoolgirl
it
was
evident
that
she
regarded
the
whole
tour
as
more
or
less
of
a
nuisance
and
just
a
means
of
killing
time
until
she
could
start
off
for
scotland
to
join
a
certain
to
which
she
had
been
invited
and
where
she
would
meet
several
of
her
most
particular
friends
i
sorry
we
could
ask
one
of
your
cousins
to
come
with
you
dear
said
rogers
to
carmel
but
there
is
room
in
the
car
for
any
one
else
it
a
good
opportunity
for
you
to
see
something
of
england
all
very
different
from
sicily
is
it
you
feel
your
first
winter
trying
i
afraid
we
certainly
lack
sunshine
in
this
climate
give
me
egypt
said
major
rogers
it
this
perpetual
damp
in
the
air
that
makes
things
melancholy
over
here
why
except
in
the
height
of
summer
it
hardly
ever
fit
to
sit
i
like
a
place
where
i
need
a
sun
helmet
you
and
mother
are
salamanders
daddy
declared
sheila
i
believe
you
enjoy
living
in
a
now
i
like
scotland
with
a
good
sharp
wind
across
the
moors
and
a
touch
of
mist
in
it
to
cool
your
face
i
like
either
town
or
mountains
if
i
ca
walk
down
regent
street
then
i
tramp
over
the
heather
but
i
do
admire
ordinary
english
scenery
it
too
tame
you
surely
do
call
this
tame
replied
her
father
pointing
at
the
village
through
which
they
were
motoring
it
one
of
the
show
bits
of
the
midlands
and
an
absolute
picture
where
are
your
eyes
child
but
sheila
was
perverse
and
refused
to
evince
any
enthusiasm
and
ended
by
pulling
out
a
novel
over
which
she
chuckled
quite
regardless
of
the
scenery
and
only
tore
herself
from
the
book
to
ask
for
the
box
of
chocolate
marsh
mallows
that
she
had
bought
at
the
last
town
where
there
was
a
good
confectioner
carmel
would
certainly
have
found
dulcie
or
even
lilias
a
more
congenial
companion
than
sheila
but
she
nevertheless
managed
to
enjoy
herself
she
loved
the
country
and
was
delighted
with
the
variety
of
the
english
landscape
though
less
rich
than
the
vineclad
south
the
greenness
of
its
fields
and
hedges
never
failed
to
amaze
her
and
she
was
fascinated
by
the
quaint
villages
their
thatched
roofs
church
spires
and
flowery
gardens
they
had
been
running
through
gloucestershire
for
somerset
and
devon
and
were
to
call
a
halt
at
various
show
places
on
the
way
major
rogers
poring
over
map
and
guide
books
would
plan
out
their
daily
route
each
morning
at
the
breakfast
table
in
the
hotel
with
good
luck
and
no
punctures
we
ought
to
reach
exeter
easily
he
remarked
looking
through
the
window
of
an
country
inn
into
the
cobbled
street
where
their
luggage
was
being
strapped
on
to
the
car
but
my
dear
remonstrated
his
wife
why
in
such
a
hurry
to
reach
exeter
let
us
stay
the
night
at
wells
and
look
over
the
cathedral
then
we
can
spend
a
few
hours
in
bath
too
daddy
and
johnson
always
like
to
tear
along
at
about
a
hundred
miles
an
hour
said
sheila
except
as
a
means
of
getting
along
the
road
i
hate
motoring
i
always
think
johnson
is
going
to
run
into
everybody
he
shaves
his
corners
so
narrowly
and
does
give
conveyances
enough
room
i
call
him
very
reckless
nonsense
he
an
excellent
driver
declared
her
father
one
of
the
best
chauffeurs
we
ever
had
though
he
only
a
young
chap
wonderfully
intelligent
too
i
trust
him
with
repairs
as
well
as
any
man
at
a
garage
a
civil
fellow
too
yes
his
manners
are
really
quite
superior
agreed
rogers
stepping
on
to
the
balcony
and
watching
the
smart
figure
of
the
young
chauffeur
who
was
opening
the
bonnet
of
the
car
for
some
last
inspection
personally
i
feel
perfectly
safe
when
johnson
is
driving
me
i
never
nervous
in
the
least
and
i
in
such
a
perpetual
panic
that
i
often
read
so
as
not
to
look
at
the
road
confessed
sheila
i
do
wish
you
ask
him
to
sound
his
horn
oftener
in
these
narrow
roads
the
banks
and
hedges
are
so
high
you
ca
see
anything
that
coming
till
it
almost
upon
you
well
it
certainly
might
be
a
wise
precaution
said
major
rogers
in
motoring
you
have
to
guard
against
the
stupidity
of
other
people
and
that
fellow
in
the
gray
nearly
charged
straight
into
us
yesterday
a
regular
he
was
if
johnson
had
hitherto
been
a
little
slack
in
respect
of
sounding
his
horn
it
was
the
only
fault
of
which
his
employers
could
complain
he
kept
the
fittings
of
the
car
at
the
very
zenith
in
the
matter
of
polish
he
was
punctuality
personified
and
most
skilful
at
the
tedious
business
of
repairing
or
changing
tires
he
rarely
spoke
addressed
but
when
questioned
he
seemed
to
have
a
good
acquaintance
with
the
country
knew
which
were
the
best
roads
and
what
sights
were
worth
visiting
in
the
various
places
through
which
they
passed
all
of
which
are
highly
desirable
qualities
in
a
chauffeur
and
a
satisfaction
to
all
concerned
it
was
the
general
plan
of
the
holiday
to
start
about
ten
or
eleven
take
a
with
them
lunch
somewhere
in
the
woods
arrive
at
their
next
about
three
or
four
and
spend
the
remainder
of
the
day
in
or
in
major
rogers
case
resting
if
he
were
suffering
from
a
severe
attack
of
pain
as
they
motored
across
somerset
in
the
direction
of
wells
they
chose
for
their
stop
a
lovely
place
on
the
top
of
a
range
of
low
hills
a
belt
of
fir
trees
edged
the
roadside
and
through
these
a
gate
led
into
a
field
as
the
gate
was
open
they
felt
licensed
to
enter
and
to
encamp
upon
a
sunny
bank
under
a
hedge
one
of
the
motor
rugs
was
spread
for
major
rogers
and
rogers
sheila
and
carmel
sat
severally
on
an
air
cushion
a
and
on
the
grass
there
was
a
grand
view
over
a
slope
of
cornfields
and
pastures
and
though
the
sun
was
warm
there
was
a
delicious
little
breeze
to
temper
the
heat
not
that
it
was
too
hot
for
any
one
except
sheila
who
panted
in
the
shade
while
the
others
exulted
in
the
sunshine
carmel
outstretched
upon
the
grass
basked
like
a
true
daughter
of
the
south
throwing
aside
her
hat
somewhat
to
rogers
consternation
you
spoil
your
complexion
child
i
sure
your
mother
never
allows
you
to
go
hatless
in
sicily
put
your
handkerchief
over
your
face
yes
i
like
to
feel
the
warmth
myself
though
not
on
my
head
this
is
the
sort
of
holiday
that
does
people
good
just
to
sit
in
the
open
air
it
a
rabbit
holiday
here
murmured
the
major
lazily
did
you
read
that
supreme
article
in
a
while
ago
well
it
was
about
a
doctor
who
invented
a
drug
that
could
turn
his
patients
into
anything
they
chose
for

a

mother
of

month
at

with
six

a

some
lively
young
people
spent
a
fortnight
as
while
the
hero
of
the
article
was
just
about
to
be
changed
into
a
rabbit
when
when
what
happened
the
usual
thing
in
such
stories
the
maid
broke
the
precious
bottle
of
medicine
that
was
to
have
worked
the
charm
and
when
he
hunted
for
the
doctor
to
buy
another
the
whole
place
had
disappeared
how
disappointing
yes
but
a
field
like
this
with
burrows
in
it
is
a
near
substitute
i
feel
i
could
live
up
here
suppose
i
buy
a
shelter
and
get
leave
to
erect
it
then
it
would
promptly
rain
daddy
and
you
be
in
the
depths
of
misery
and
longing
for
a
decent
hotel
declared
sheila
to
suit
major
rogers
humor
they
stayed
nearly
two
hours
in
the
field
the
quiet
was
just
what
his
doctor
had
ordered
for
him
he
had
spent
a
restless
night
and
though
he
could
not
sleep
now
the
air
and
the
sunshine
calmed
his
nerves
he
seemed
better
than
he
had
been
for
days
and
enjoyed
the
run
downhill
into
wells
as
they
were
stepping
out
of
the
motor
at
the
hotel
carmel
gave
an
exclamation
of
concern
i
lost
my
bracelet
she
declared
what
a
nuisance
wherever
can
it
have
gone
johnson
the
chauffeur
immediately
searched
on
the
floor
and
cushions
of
the
car
but
without
success
no
bracelet
was
there
when
did
you
have
it
last
asked
rogers
in
the
rabbit
field
where
we
had
lunch
i
remember
clasping
and
unclasping
it
and
i
suppose
it
must
have
slipped
off
my
wrist
without
my
noticing
never
mind
i
sorry
but
it
certainly
is
too
far
to
go
back
and
look
for
it
dear
said
rogers
was
it
valuable
asked
sheila
oh
no
not
at
all
only
mother
gave
it
to
me
on
my
last
birthday
it
does
really
matter
and
of
course
it
ca
be
helped
now
carmel
was
vexed
nevertheless
with
her
own
carelessness
the
little
bracelet
had
been
a
favorite
and
she
hated
to
lose
it
she
missed
the
feel
of
it
on
her
wrist
her
first
thought
when
she
woke
next
morning
was
of
annoyance
at
the
incident
as
she
walked
down
to
breakfast
in
the
the
chauffeur
was
standing
by
the
hall
door
he
came
up
at
once
as
if
he
had
been
expressly
waiting
for
her
and
handed
her
a
small
parcel
to
her
utter
surprise
it
contained
the
missing
bracelet
johnson
she
called
for
he
had
turned
quickly
away
johnson
oh
where
did
you
find
this
not
in
the
car
surely
no
miss
carmel
it
was
just
where
you
thought
you
had
left
it
in
the
field
where
you
had
lunch
i
got
up
early
and
fetched
it
before
breakfast
replied
johnson
pausing
on
the
doorstep
you
went
all
that
way
how
kind
of
you
thank
you
ever
so
much
exclaimed
carmel
clasping
her
bangle
on
her
wrist
again
i
ca
tell
you
how
pleased
i
am
to
have
it
but
johnson
avoiding
her
eyes
and
seeming
anxious
to
get
away
from
her
thanks
was
already
out
of
the
front
door
and
across
the
courtyard
to
the
garage
i
wonder
if
english
are
always
as
shy
as
that
thought
carmel
an
italian
would
certainly
have
waited
to
let
me
say
you
chapter
x
a
meeting
after
a
morning
in
wells
to
look
at
the
cathedral
and
other
beauty
spots
the
party
motored
on
to
glastonbury
where
again
they
called
a
halt
to
look
at
the
abbey
and
the
museum
major
rogers
was
interested
in
the
objects
which
had
been
excavated
from
the
prehistoric
lake
dwellings
in
the
neighborhood
and
spent
so
much
time
poring
over
bronze
brooches
horn
flint
scrapers
glass
rings
and
fragments
of
decorated
pottery
that
sheila
lost
all
patience
is
dad
going
to
spend
the
whole
day
in
this
moldy
old
museum
she
asked
dramatically
i
hate
anything
what
does
it
matter
to
us
how
people
lived
in
pile
dwellings
in
the
middle
of
a
lake
to
judge
from
those
fancy
pictures
of
them
on
the
wall
there
they
must
have
been
a
set
of
uncouth
savages
why
ca
we
drive
on
to
dawlish
or
some
other
decent
seaside
place
instead
of
poking
about
in
musty
cathedrals
and
tiresome
museums
i
fed
up
now
sheila
do
be
naughty
whispered
her
mother
i
only
too
glad
to
see
your
father
take
an
interest
in
anything
i
believe
enjoying
this
tour
if
you
tired
of
the
museum
go
out
and
look
at
the
shops
until
we
ready
there
are
any
worth
looking
at
in
a
wretched
little
country
town
yawned
sheila
no
i
really
do
want
to
go
over
the
abbey
either
thanks
i
shall
sit
inside
the
car
and
write
while
you
do
the
major
rogers
never
hurried
himself
to
suit
his
daughter
whims
so
sheila
was
left
to
sit
in
the
car
addressing
tragic
letters
and
picture
post
cards
to
her
friends
and
the
rest
of
the
party
finished
examining
the
museum
and
went
to
view
the
ruins
of
the
famous
abbey
if
sheila
prefers
to
stay
outside
she
can
look
after
the
car
said
her
father
and
i
shall
take
johnson
in
with
us
he
an
intelligent
fellow
and
i
sure
he
appreciates
the
shows
it
rather
hard
on
him
if
he
never
gets
the
chance
to
see
anything
i
believe
he
goes
on
his
own
account
when
he
has
the
opportunity
replied
rogers
but
bring
him
in
by
all
means
he
always
strikes
me
as
having
very
refined
tastes
i
should
think
trying
to
educate
himself
but
he
so
reserved
i
never
can
get
anything
out
of
him
he
seems
fond
of
books
volunteered
carmel
he
reads
all
the
time
when
he
waiting
for
us
in
the
car
johnson
accepted
with
alacrity
the
invitation
to
view
the
abbey
and
walked
round
the
ruins
apparently
much
interested
in
what
he
saw
though
following
his
usual
custom
he
spoke
seldom
and
then
only
in
brief
reply
to
questions
once
when
major
and
rogers
were
puzzling
over
a
latin
inscription
he
seemed
on
the
point
of
making
a
remark
but
apparently
changed
his
mind
and
walked
away
he
almost
well
trained
commented
rogers
of
course
a
conversational
chauffeur
is
a
nuisance
but
i
have
an
impression
that
johnson
could
be
quite
interesting
if
he
liked
some
day
i
shall
try
to
make
him
talk
better
leave
him
alone
said
major
rogers
i
think
things
do
very
well
as
they
are
from
glastonbury
they
motored
through
the
beautiful
county
of
somerset
into
leafy
devonshire
taking
easy
stages
so
as
not
to
overtire
the
invalid
and
halting
at
any
place
where
the
guide
book
pointed
out
objects
worthy
of
notice
to
please
carmel
they
were
making
in
the
direction
of
tivermouth
where
they
hoped
to
arrive
in
time
to
meet
the
ingletons
they
had
telegraphed
for
rooms
at
the
hill
crest
hotel
and
if
the
place
suited
major
rogers
they
proposed
to
spend
a
week
there
there
may
be
perhaps
a
dance
or
a
tennis
tournament
or
something
interesting
going
on
exulted
sheila
who
had
urged
the
decision
at
any
rate
there
be
somebody
to
talk
to
in
a
decent
hotel
it
wo
be
just
all
scenery
let
us
spin
along
dad
and
get
there
hurry
no
man
cattle
replied
her
father
remember
i
am
out
for
a
holiday
and
i
like
long
rests
by
the
roadside
i
looking
forward
to
a
siesta
on
the
grass
somewhere
this
afternoon
the
scent
of
the
woods
does
me
good
so
once
more
the
party
found
a
picturesque
spot
and
stopped
for
lunch
and
an
hour
or
two
of
quiet
under
the
trees
before
they
took
again
to
the
open
road
the
spot
which
they
chose
this
time
was
on
a
slope
reaching
down
to
a
river
above
was
a
thick
belt
of
pines
and
below
the
water
dashed
with
a
pleasant
murmuring
sound
very
soothing
on
a
warm
afternoon
it
was
an
ideal
rabbit
playground
for
major
rogers
and
he
established
himself
comfortably
with
rugs
and
cushions
after
lunch
hoping
to
be
able
to
snatch
some
sleep
rogers
took
her
knitting
from
her
and
sheila
who
had
a
voluminous
correspondence
asked
johnson
for
her
dispatch
case
and
began
to
write
letters
as
carmel
had
nothing
very
particular
to
do
and
grew
tired
of
sitting
still
she
rose
presently
and
rambled
down
the
wood
to
the
it
was
beautiful
to
stand
and
watch
the
water
swirling
by
to
gaze
at
the
meadow
on
the
opposite
bank
and
to
amuse
herself
by
throwing
little
sticks
into
the
hurrying
current
there
was
an
old
split
that
overhung
the
bank
and
it
struck
her
that
this
would
make
a
most
comfortable
and
delightful
rustic
seat
she
climbed
on
to
it
quite
easily
crawled
along
and
sat
at
the
end
with
her
feet
swinging
over
the
river
it
was
such
an
idyllic
situation
that
she
felt
herself
a
mixture
of
a
tree
nymph
and
a
water
nymph
or
to
follow
the
humor
could
almost
imagine
that
she
was
taking
her
holiday
in
the
shape
of
a
bird
if
she
would
have
been
content
to
remain
quietly
seated
just
enjoying
the
scenery
all
might
have
been
well
but
unfortunately
carmel
made
the
discovery
that
by
exercising
a
little
energy
she
could
make
the
stump
rock
the
sensation
was
as
pleasant
as
a
swing
up
and
down
and
up
and
down
she
swayed
till
the
poor
old
split
tree
could
bear
the
strain
no
longer
and
suddenly
with
an
awful
crash
the
part
on
which
she
rested
broke
off
and
precipitated
her
into
the
river
her
cry
of
terror
as
she
struck
the
water
echoed
through
the
wood
as
she
rose
to
the
surface
she
managed
to
clutch
hold
of
some
of
the
branches
and
support
herself
but
she
was
in
a
position
of
great
danger
for
the
stump
was
hardly
holding
to
the
edge
of
the
bank
and
in
another
moment
or
two
would
probably
be
whirled
away
by
the
current
as
she
shouted
again
there
was
a
quick
dash
through
the
undergrowth
and
johnson
the
chauffeur
shot
down
through
the
wood
at
a
speed
that
could
almost
compete
with
the
car
in
a
bound
he
jumped
the
bank
and
plunging
into
the
river
struggled
to
her
help
and
succeeded
in
pulling
her
back
out
of
the
current
into
the
shallow
water
among
the
reeds
at
the
brink
by
this
time
major
and
rogers
and
sheila
had
all
three
rushed
to
the
spot
and
were
able
to
extend
hands
from
the
bank
carmel
and
johnson
both
scrambled
out
of
the
river
wet
through
and
covered
with
mud
the
most
wretched
and
dilapidated
objects
oh
she
take
a
chill
whatever
are
we
to
do
to
get
her
dry
cried
rogers
distractedly
mopping
her
young
guest
streaming
face
with
a
dainty
handkerchief
is
there
a
cottage
anywhere
near
we
better
get
into
the
car
and
motor
along
till
we
find
one
suggested
major
rogers
johnson
you
deserve
a
medal
for
this
i
never
saw
anything
so
prompt
in
my
life
it
was
like
a
whirlwind
we
shall
make
a
horrible
mess
of
the
car
objected
carmel
trying
to
wipe
some
of
the
mud
from
her
clothes
never
mind
sit
on
this
rug
you
shivering
already
child
sheila
bring
my
and
your
father
cushion
now
johnson
just
anywhere
the
very
first
cottage
that
will
take
us
in
luckily
they
were
not
far
from
a
village
with
a
fairly
comfortable
inn
where
a
sympathetic
landlady
provided
bedrooms
and
hot
water
as
their
luggage
was
on
the
car
it
was
an
easy
matter
to
change
and
before
very
long
both
carmel
and
her
rescuer
were
in
dry
garments
and
drinking
the
hot
coffee
which
rogers
insisted
upon
as
a
preventive
against
catching
cold
i
shall
hardly
dare
to
let
you
out
of
my
sight
again
carmel
she
said
half
laughingly
yet
half
in
earnest
i
do
want
to
have
to
write
to
your
mother
and
tell
her
you
drowned
nonsense
declared
the
major
rather
testily
it
not
a
thing
likely
to
do
twice
i
should
think
she
be
frightened
to
go
anywhere
near
a
river
again
just
yet
are
those
clothes
dry
well
never
mind
pack
them
as
they
are
we
ca
wait
for
them
and
the
rug
too
just
bundle
it
up
and
put
it
at
the
bottom
of
the
car
johnson
can
brush
it
he
a
fine
chap
i
shall
write
to
the
about
this
business
they
ought
to
give
him
a
medal
i
tried
to
thank
him
said
carmel
but
directly
i
begin
he
dives
away
and
does
something
at
the
car
he
does
seem
to
want
to
be
thanked
oh
that
just
johnson
usual
way
drawled
sheila
i
expect
pleased
all
the
same
you
look
a
little
more
respectable
now
carmel
i
should
have
liked
to
take
you
into
the
hill
crest
hotel
as
you
were
an
hour
ago
i
expect
after
this
stoppage
we
shall
arrive
too
late
to
dress
comfortably
for
dinner
unless
johnson
literally
tears
along
and
then
i
scared
out
of
my
wits
what
a
life
i
never
go
motoring
for
choice
it
not
my
idea
of
a
holiday
i
must
say
after
all
though
johnson
seldom
exceeded
the
speed
limit
the
rogers
arrived
at
tivermouth
in
ample
time
for
sheila
to
don
a
fascinating
evening
costume
and
to
arrange
her
fair
hair
in
an
elaborate
coiffure
the
hotel
was
full
of
summer
visitors
and
in
her
opinion
the
large
with
its
moorish
decorations
the
numerous
little
tables
and
the
fashionable
crowd
who
flocked
in
at
the
sounding
of
a
gong
were
far
more
entertaining
than
a
wood
and
a
picnic
meal
but
sheila
was
not
fond
of
rabbit
holidays
illustration
johnson
the
chauffeur
shot
down
through
the
wood
it
beats
those
places
we
stayed
at
in
the
country
towns
does
it
she
said
to
carmel
as
they
sat
in
the
lounge
waiting
for
major
and
rogers
to
come
down
stairs
by
the
by
are
your
cousins
here
i
looked
in
the
visitors
book
and
could
find
their
names
what
has
happened
to
them
a
letter
from
dulcie
was
waiting
for
me
explained
carmel
they
could
get
rooms
here
they
were
writing
to
the
nest
hotel
and
hoped
to
get
taken
in
there
i
do
know
whether
they
arrived
or
not
dulcie
did
say
exactly
which
day
they
were
starting
it
just
like
dulcie
she
generally
misses
out
the
most
important
point
well
i
suppose
they
look
you
up
when
they
do
arrive
said
sheila
carelessly
anyway
i
bless
them
for
giving
us
some
sort
of
an
anchor
down
here
i
feel
i
going
to
enjoy
myself
i
asked
the
manageress
and
she
says
there
to
be
a
dance
after
dinner
carmel
sitting
on
a
cane
chair
in
the
palm
lounge
next
morning
agreed
with
sheila
that
hill
crest
hotel
was
a
remarkably
comfortable
and
luxurious
place
a
fountain
was
splashing
near
her
foreign
birds
sang
and
twittered
in
the
aviary
and
large
pots
of
geraniums
made
bright
patches
of
color
under
the
green
of
the
palms
pleasant
though
it
was
however
it
lacked
the
charm
of
the
open
air
and
throwing
down
the
magazine
she
was
reading
carmel
strolled
through
the
hall
and
the
glass
veranda
on
to
the
terrace
outside
the
hotel
certainly
had
a
most
beautiful
situation
as
its
name
implied
it
stood
on
the
crest
of
a
hill
surrounded
by
woods
and
grounds
that
stretched
to
the
beach
a
little
noisy
devonshire
river
raced
past
it
through
the
glen
and
behind
it
lay
the
heathery
waste
of
a
great
moorland
below
lay
the
gleaming
waters
of
the
bay
with
small
boats
bobbing
about
and
a
distant
view
of
the
crags
and
headlands
of
a
rugged
coast
line
the
terrace
was
planted
with
a
border
of
trailing
pink
geraniums
and
the
bank
that
sloped
below
was
a
superb
mass
of
hydrangeas
in
full
bloom
their
delicate
shades
of
blue
and
pink
looking
like
the
hues
of
dawn
in
a
clear
sky
carmel
established
herself
on
a
seat
to
enjoy
the
prospect
and
picking
up
a
gray
persian
cat
which
was
also
sunning
itself
on
the
terrace
fondled
the
pretty
creature
in
her
arms
she
was
seeing
england
to
the
best
advantage
for
nowhere
could
there
have
been
a
lovelier
scene
than
the
one
which
lay
before
her
delighted
eyes
tivermouth
had
a
reputation
as
a
beauty
spot
and
owing
to
its
long
distance
from
the
railway
was
as
yet
unspoilt
by
a
too
great
invasion
of
tourists
there
were
other
hotels
nestling
among
the
greenery
of
the
woods
and
carmel
wondered
if
the
ingletons
had
arrived
at
one
of
them
and
at
which
of
the
white
houses
on
the
beach
the
boys
were
staying
with
miss
mason
as
she
was
still
gazing
and
speculating
there
was
a
crunch
of
footsteps
on
the
gravel
behind
a
voice
called
her
name
and
looking
round
she
saw
cousin
clare
lilias
and
dulcie
hurrying
towards
her
there
was
an
enthusiastic
greeting
followed
by
explanations
from
all
three
we
the
greatest
difficulty
to
get
rooms
the
whole
place
seems
full
up
they
could
take
us
at
the
nest
we
got
in
at
the
though
i
wish
we
could
have
been
here
with
you
never
mind
so
long
as
we
at
tivermouth
at
all
is
it
just
too
gorgeous
for
words
we
only
arrived
late
last
night
there
such
heaps
we
want
to
tell
you
there
was
indeed
much
to
be
told
on
both
sides
all
three
girls
had
had
numerous
experiences
during
the
short
time
of
their
parting
and
they
were
anxious
to
compare
notes
then
cousin
clare
lilias
and
dulcie
must
be
introduced
to
the
rogers
family
who
were
all
writing
letters
in
a
private
but
stopped
their
correspondence
to
extend
a
hearty
welcome
and
to
chat
with
the
in
a
short
time
the
party
rearranged
itself
leaving
cousin
clare
to
talk
with
major
and
rogers
lilias
and
dulcie
with
carmel
on
the
terrace
and
sheila
who
had
stepped
with
them
out
at
the
french
window
straying
away
with
a
young
highland
officer
with
whom
she
had
danced
the
night
before
never
mind
sheila
she
does
want
laughed
carmel
squeezing
both
her
cousins
arms
for
she
was
in
the
middle
oh
it
nice
to
see
you
again
let
walk
along
here
to
the
end
of
the
terrace
i
had
all
sorts
of
adventures
since
i
saw
you
i
was
nearly
drowned
yesterday
in
a
river
only
johnson
the
chauffeur
fished
me
out
you
should
have
seen
me
all
dripping
and
covered
with
mud
and
johnson
was
just
as
bad
we
made
such
a
mess
of
the
car
with
our
muddy
clothes
i
wonder
if
he
got
it
clean
yet
by
the
by
i
left
my
post
cards
in
the
side
pocket
love
to
show
them
to
you
shall
we
go
and
get
them
the
garage
is
quite
close
only
just
down
this
path
do
you
mind
coming
go
ahead
we
like
to
agreed
dulcie
so
they
plunged
down
the
on
a
twisting
path
past
the
bank
of
hydrangeas
and
through
a
grove
of
escallonias
to
where
the
garage
a
large
building
with
a
roof
stood
on
a
natural
platform
of
rock
close
to
the
steep
high
road
that
flanked
the
hotel
the
yard
was
full
of
visitors
cars
in
process
of
being
cleaned
and
chauffeurs
were
busy
with
hose
or
polishing
fittings
i
wonder
where
johnson
has
put
ours
said
carmel
threading
her
way
between
an
enormous
daimler
and
a
pretty
little
oh
there
it
is
that
one
in
the
corner
come
along
there
just
room
to
pass
here
behind
this
coupé
i
expect
the
post
cards
are
all
right
johnson
would
take
care
of
them
for
me
i
ask
him
to
get
them
johnson
the
chauffeur
who
was
bending
over
the
car
too
busy
with
wrench
and
screwdriver
to
notice
their
approach
straightened
himself
instantly
and
glanced
at
the
three
girls
as
his
eyes
fell
on
lilias
and
dulcie
his
expression
changed
to
one
of
utter
consternation
and
amazement
and
he
colored
to
the
roots
of
his
fair
hair
they
on
their
part
gazed
at
him
as
if
they
had
encountered
a
specter
everard
gasped
dulcie
everard
faltered
lilias
it
never
here
indeed
was
a
drama
four
more
astonished
young
people
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
conceive
for
a
moment
everard
seemed
as
if
he
were
going
to
bolt
but
carmel
whose
quick
mind
instantly
grasped
the
situation
motioned
him
into
the
empty
behind
and
following
with
lilias
and
dulcie
partly
closed
the
door
so
you
everard
are
you
she
said
looking
at
him
hard
well
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
never
thought
your
name
was
really
johnson
i
told
sheila
i
was
sure
you
were
a
gentleman
why
have
you
been
masquerading
like
this
why
do
you
go
home
to
the
chase
oh
come
home
everard
echoed
lilias
entreatingly
the
shook
his
head
he
was
still
almost
too
covered
with
confusion
to
admit
of
speech
i
did
expect
to
meet
you
girls
he
said
at
last
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
just
to
forget
me
and
leave
me
where
i
am
i
shall
go
back
to
the
chase
that
point
i
quite
decided
but
we
want
you
there
said
carmel
gently
you
everard
looked
frankly
puzzled
oh
everard
burst
out
dulcie
you
do
understand
you
ran
away
and
never
waited
to
hear
anything
and
we
could
write
to
you
because
you
sent
no
address
you
thought
grandfather
had
left
the
property
to
a
boy
cousin
leslie
well
did
he
yes
and
no
there
is
no
boy
cousin
this
is
leslie
only
she
called
carmel
the
heiress
of
cheverley
chase
you
exclaimed
everard
again
gazing
at
carmel
do
call
me
heiress
dulcie
protested
carmel
you
know
said
from
the
very
first
that
i
do
intend
to
take
the
chase
away
from
you
all
it
yours
every
bit
as
much
as
mine
and
more
so
because
my
own
real
home
is
in
sicily
and
i
hope
to
go
back
there
some
day
everard
will
you
make
friends
with
me
on
that
understanding
and
shake
hands
i
do
want
to
turn
anybody
out
of
the
chase
carmel
held
out
a
slim
little
hand
and
everard
accepted
it
delicately
as
if
it
had
been
that
of
a
princess
i
still
stunned
he
remarked
to
think
i
should
have
been
driving
you
all
this
time
and
not
have
known
you
were
leslie
ingleton
i
never
chanced
to
hear
your
surname
i
thought
you
were
rogers
niece
and
so
i
am
laughed
carmel
at
least
she
my
at
any
rate
is
it
a
regular
of
everard
put
in
lilias
why
did
you
turn
chauffeur
we
thought
you
had
run
away
to
sea
i
meant
to
answered
her
brother
bitterly
but
when
it
came
to
the
point
of
getting
employment
i
found
the
only
thing
i
could
earn
a
living
at
was
driving
a
car
i
do
know
that
i
even
do
that
very
decently
but
at
any
rate
i
you
better
leave
me
where
i
am
it
all
i
good
for
not
a
bit
of
it
answered
carmel
i
arranged
the
whole
thing
in
my
mind
already
we
make
an
exchange
milner
shall
take
charge
of
the
car
for
the
rogers
until
they
can
find
another
chauffeur
and
you
shall
drive
cousin
clare
and
lilias
and
dulcie
and
me
back
to
the
chase
now
do
begin
to
talk
for
it
quite
settled
and
for
once
in
my
life
i
declare
i
mean
to
have
my
own
way
chapter
xi
a
secret
society
carmel
seldom
asserted
herself
but
if
she
set
her
heart
on
an
object
she
generally
managed
to
persuade
people
to
her
way
of
thinking
this
case
proved
no
exception
and
she
contrived
with
little
difficulty
to
transfer
the
amazed
but
willing
milner
temporarily
into
the
service
of
major
rogers
and
to
instal
everard
minus
his
chauffeur
uniform
and
looking
once
more
an
ingleton
to
drive
the
daimler
car
back
to
cheverley
chase
perhaps
the
talk
which
major
rogers
had
with
his
johnson
partly
worked
the
miracle
exactly
what
he
said
was
entirely
between
themselves
but
everard
burst
out
into
eulogies
regarding
the
major
to
lilias
who
was
still
his
chief
confidante
one
of
the
best
chaps
i
ever
met
a
real
good
sort
i
sha
forget
what
he
said
to
me
i
can
tell
you
i
come
to
look
at
things
in
a
different
light
lately
i
do
anything
he
suggests
i
trust
his
advice
sooner
than
that
of
anybody
i
know
i
have
a
good
talk
with
bowden
and
see
if
he
agrees
by
jove
i
shall
be
a
surprise
packet
to
him
sha
i
bowden
was
not
nearly
so
much
astonished
as
everard
had
anticipated
he
took
his
ward
return
quite
as
a
matter
of
course
and
at
once
turned
to
the
business
side
of
affairs
after
running
away
and
gaining
his
own
living
for
so
many
months
it
was
neither
possible
nor
desirable
for
everard
to
go
back
to
harrow
he
had
broken
the
last
link
with
his
school
days
and
must
face
the
problem
of
his
future
career
his
grandfather
had
wished
him
to
go
on
to
cambridge
and
his
guardian
also
considered
it
would
be
advisable
for
him
to
take
a
university
degree
meantime
his
studies
were
very
much
in
arrears
he
had
never
worked
hard
at
school
and
would
need
considerable
application
to
his
books
before
being
ready
to
begin
his
terms
at
college
by
the
advice
of
major
rogers
bowden
decided
to
engage
a
tutor
to
coach
him
at
the
chase
the
house
would
be
perfectly
quiet
while
the
girls
and
the
younger
boys
were
away
at
school
and
as
everard
really
seemed
to
take
the
matter
seriously
he
might
be
expected
to
make
good
progress
in
the
matter
of
a
tutor
major
rogers
was
fortunately
able
to
recommend
just
the
right
man
stacey
had
been
studying
for
orders
at
cambridge
when
he
was
called
up
and
had
joined
the
army
after
serious
wounds
in
france
he
had
made
a
slow
recovery
and
though
perfectly
able
to
act
as
coach
he
would
be
glad
of
a
period
of
quiet
in
the
country
before
returning
to
cambridge
he
was
a
brilliant
scholar
and
a
thoroughly
good
fellow
who
might
be
trusted
to
make
the
best
possible
companion
for
everard
in
the
circumstances
the
whole
business
was
fixed
up
at
once
and
he
was
to
arrive
within
ten
days
i
sorry
we
shall
just
miss
seeing
him
said
carmel
to
everard
on
the
evening
before
the
girls
went
back
to
chilcombe
hall
but
i
shall
think
of
you
studying
away
at
your
maths
you
clever
are
you
everard
i
do
know
much
about
english
universities
but
is
a
tripos
what
you
work
for
at
cambridge
suppose
you
came
out
senior
wrangler
we
be
proud
of
you
no
fear
of
that
i
afraid
carmel
i
a
long
way
behind
and
shall
have
to
swat
like
anything
to
get
myself
up
to
even
ordinary
standard
burn
the
midnight
oil
and
all
that
kind
of
weariness
to
the
flesh
but
you
do
it
carmel
was
looking
at
him
critically
you
got
the
right
shape
of
head
daddy
and
one
of
his
friends
signor
penati
were
fearfully
keen
on
phrenology
and
they
used
to
make
me
notice
the
shape
of
people
heads
and
of
the
greek
and
roman
busts
in
the
museums
it
wonderful
how
truly
they
tell
character
the
rules
hardly
ever
fail
what
do
you
make
of
my
particular
phiz
then
you
young
sicilian
witch
great
ability
if
you
only
persevere
a
noble
mind
and
patriotism
your
forehead
is
just
like
the
bust
of
the
emperor
augustus
you
scorn
bribes
and
speak
out
for
the
right
i
prophesy
that
you
some
day
get
into
parliament
and
do
splendid
work
for
your
country
whew
i
afraid
i
never
reach
your
expectations
it
a
big
order
you
laid
down
for
me
you
could
do
it
though
if
you
try
oh
do
contradict
me
for
i
know
i
have
studied
heads
with
signor
penati
for
nothing
first
you
going
to
make
a
good
master
of
the
chase
and
then
you
help
england
not
of
the
chase
carmel
said
everard
gently
we
argued
that
point
out
thoroughly
i
think
no
no
let
me
tell
you
once
again
that
i
do
want
to
be
mistress
here
i
only
came
over
to
england
to
please
mother
and
daddy
i
going
back
to
sicily
to
live
as
soon
as
i
can
choose
for
myself
directly
i
shall
hand
over
the
chase
to
you
you
a
far
more
suitable
owner
for
it
than
i
am
i
feel
that
strongly
it
ought
never
to
have
been
left
to
me
but
i
put
all
that
right
again
why
ca
you
take
it
she
continued
eagerly
as
everard
shook
his
head
surely
i
can
give
it
to
you
if
i
like
why
not
why
not
you
too
young
yet
to
understand
how
could
i
be
such
an
utter
slacker
and
sneak
as
to
accept
your
inheritance
it
unthinkable
put
that
idea
out
of
your
little
head
for
it
can
never
happen
as
for
the
rest
of
your
prophecy
it
a
long
climb
to
get
into
parliament
nothing
like
the
man
you
think
me
carmel
though
i
going
to
make
a
spurt
now
at
any
rate
do
expect
to
find
me
a
senior
wrangler
by
christmas
though
stacey
will
probably
tell
you
i
an
utter
dunderhead
i
shall
quarrel
with
him
if
he
does
said
carmel
decidedly
the
three
girls
went
back
to
school
on
the
following
day
half
regretful
to
leave
the
chase
but
rather
excited
at
the
prospect
of
meeting
their
companions
now
that
carmel
had
got
over
her
first
stage
of
homesickness
she
liked
chilcombe
and
had
made
many
friends
there
she
intended
to
enjoy
the
autumn
term
to
the
best
of
her
ability
she
had
brought
the
materials
for
pursuing
several
pet
hobbies
and
she
settled
all
her
numerous
possessions
into
her
small
bedroom
with
much
satisfaction
she
kept
the
door
into
the
blue
grotto
open
so
that
she
might
talk
during
the
process
gowan
also
busy
unpacking
kept
firing
off
pieces
of
information
bertha
flitted
in
and
out
like
a
butterfly
and
girls
from
other
dormitories
paid
occasional
visits
phillida
who
was
a
prime
favorite
presently
came
in
and
installing
herself
on
the
end
of
dulcie
bed
so
that
she
could
address
the
occupants
of
both
bedrooms
began
to
draw
plans
i
got
an
idea
she
announced
it
a
jolly
good
one
too
so
you
need
smile
it
a
good
thing
somebody
does
have
ideas
in
this
place
or
you
all
go
to
sleep
well
it
this
i
really
ca
stand
the
swank
of
those
girls
in
the
gold
bedroom
they
seem
to
imagine
the
school
belongs
to
them
they
not
very
much
older
than
we
are
indeed
nona
is
actually
six
weeks
younger
than
lilias
and
yet
they
give
themselves
the
airs
of
all
creation
just
now
laurette
said
to
me
out
of
my
way
child
child
indeed
i
fifteen
and
tall
for
my
age
i
vote
that
we
start
a
secret
society
just
among
our
own
set
to
resist
them
jolly
agreed
dulcie
a
little
wholesome
taking
down
is
just
what
they
need
laurette
the
limit
sometimes
whom
shall
we
ask
to
join
well
all
of
you
here
and
myself
and
noreen
and
prissie
and
edith
that
would
make
nine
quite
enough
too
said
gowan
a
secret
society
much
greater
fun
if
it
small
things
are
apt
to
leak
out
when
you
have
too
many
members
i
take
it
we
want
to
play
an
occasional
rag
on
the
gold
bedroom
very
well
the
fewer
in
it
the
better
what
shall
we
call
our
society
asked
dulcie
headers
would
about
suit
suggested
lilias
no
no
that
sounds
as
if
we
were
afraid
of
getting
swelled
head
ourselves
at
least
anybody
might
take
it
that
way
there
a
big
secret
society
in
sicily
called
mafia
vouchsafed
carmel
then
let
us
call
ours
chilcombe
mafia
no
one
will
understand
what
we
mean
even
if
they
get
hold
of
the
name
indeed
i
should
mind
casually
mentioning
it
now
and
then
just
to
puzzle
them
when
things
get
bad
mafia
will
take
them
up
strike
secretly
and
suddenly
agreed
dulcie
with
a
chuckle
let
sign
our
names
at
once
declared
phillida
enthusiastically
at
carmel
suggestion
however
they
made
rather
more
of
a
ceremony
of
the
initiation
of
their
new
order
the
prospective
members
retired
into
the
wood
above
the
garden
and
in
strict
privacy
took
an
oath
of
secrecy
and
service
then
with
edith
fountain
pen
filled
for
the
occasion
with
red
ink
they
inscribed
their
autographs
on
a
piece
of
paper
rolled
it
up
placed
it
in
a
bottle
then
solemnly
dug
a
hole
and
buried
the
said
bottle
under
a
tree
it
will
be
here
for
a
testimony
against
any
girl
who
breaks
her
oath
declared
phillida
carmel
says
the
real
mafia
sign
their
names
in
blood
but
i
think
that
horrid
and
red
ink
will
do
quite
as
well
just
as
i
was
coming
out
now
laurette
said
to
me
do
go
running
away
because
i
want
one
of
you
younger
ones
to
do
something
for
me
presently
she
said
it
with
the
air
of
a
duchess
cheek
agreed
the
others
it
high
time
we
made
up
a
society
against
her
many
and
various
were
the
offences
that
were
laid
to
laurette
score
lilias
had
a
private
grievance
because
she
fancied
that
laurette
had
never
been
so
civil
to
herself
and
dulcie
since
it
was
known
that
their
brother
was
not
to
inherit
the
chase
gowan
who
liked
plain
speaking
accused
laurette
of
telling
fiblets
bertha
had
had
a
squabble
over
the
bathroom
and
prissie
a
wrestle
for
the
piano
laurette
always
reminds
me
of
that
rhyme
that
the
undergrads
made
up
about
the
master
of
balliol
said
edith
come
i
my
name
is
jowett
all
there
is
to
know
i
know
it
i
the
head
of
this
here
college
what
i
do
know
is
knowledge
that
laurette
attitude
exactly
she
so
superior
to
everybody
we
take
her
down
do
worry
yourself
smiled
dulcie
we
must
just
wait
for
a
good
opportunity
and
then
the
secret
hand
will
smite
laughed
carmel
who
enjoyed
the
fun
as
much
as
anybody
laurette
aggravatingly
superior
pose
was
especially
apparent
in
her
attitude
towards
the
mistresses
she
monopolized
miss
herbert
treated
her
almost
like
a
friend
wrote
notes
to
her
left
flowers
in
her
bedroom
and
walked
with
her
in
the
garden
perhaps
the
mistress
was
lonely
possibly
she
was
flattered
by
receiving
so
much
attention
at
any
rate
she
allowed
laurette
to
be
on
terms
of
great
intimacy
and
gave
her
a
far
larger
share
of
her
confidence
than
was
at
all
wise
laurette
after
a
hot
affection
lasting
three
weeks
got
tired
of
miss
herbert
and
suddenly
cooled
off
gowan
and
carmel
going
into
the
one
day
found
her
discussing
her
former
idol
with
a
group
of
her
chums
do
you
call
her
pretty
well
now
i
she
was
saying
emphatically
she
may
have
been
pretty
once
but
now
she
getting
decidedly
i
ca
say
i
admire
faded
sentimental
people
sentimental
said
truie
i
should
call
her
sentimental
at
all
she
only
too
horribly
practical
in
my
opinion
you
do
know
her
as
i
do
my
dear
the
things
she
told
me
the
love
affairs
she
been
through
i
had
the
whole
history
of
them
and
she
used
to
blush
and
look
most
romantic
it
was
all
i
could
do
not
to
burst
out
laughing
you
scream
if
i
were
to
tell
you
first
there
was
a
clergyman
here
stop
interrupted
gowan
breaking
abruptly
into
the
conversation
and
turning
two
blazing
blue
eyes
on
laurette
anything
miss
herbert
may
have
told
you
was
certainly
in
confidence
and
to
go
and
blab
it
over
the
school
seems
to
me
the
meanest
sneakiest
trick
i
ever
heard
of
you
an
absolute
blighter
laurette
well
i
sure
what
business
is
it
of
yours
gowan
barbour
or
of
carmel
ingleton
either
cheek
it
our
business
flared
carmel
as
indignant
as
gowan
horribly
mean
to
make
friends
with
any
one
and
hear
all
her
secrets
and
then
go
and
make
fun
of
them
it
playing
it
low
added
gowan
determined
to
speak
her
mind
for
once
and
i
hope
somebody
will
make
fun
of
some
day
just
to
serve
you
right
some
day
be
and
and
people
will
giggle
and
say
you
have
off
in
spite
of
all
your
efforts
and
they
wonder
how
old
you
really
are
and
they
remember
when
you
came
out
and
you
ca
be
a
chicken
and
they
do
like
to
see
dressed
like
lamb
and
all
the
rest
of
the
kind
pleasant
things
that
people
of
your
type
find
to
say
know
well
i
sha
be
in
the
least
sorry
for
you
it
will
be
a
judgment
laurette
had
made
a
desperate
attempt
to
interrupt
gowan
flow
of
words
but
she
might
as
well
have
tried
to
stop
the
brook
when
gowan
began
she
never
even
paused
for
breath
her
wrath
was
like
a
whirlwind
laurette
three
chums
had
turned
away
as
if
rather
ashamed
and
began
hastily
to
get
out
books
and
they
pretended
not
to
notice
when
laurette
looked
at
them
for
support
yes
you
need
think
truie
and
hester
and
muriel
will
back
you
up
continued
gowan
unless
they
as
mean
as
you
are
there
finished
now
so
you
need
butt
in
you
know
exactly
what
i
think
of
you
come
along
carmel
the
two
immediate
results
of
this
episode
were
a
bitter
feud
between
laurette
and
gowan
and
a
sympathetic
interest
in
miss
herbert
by
all
the
members
of
the
mafia
they
felt
that
her
confidence
had
been
betrayed
and
they
would
have
liked
somehow
to
make
it
up
to
her
they
brought
so
many
floral
offerings
to
her
bedroom
that
her
vases
were
almost
inconveniently
crowded
carmel
hearing
that
she
was
collecting
post
cards
sent
home
for
some
special
ones
of
sicily
dulcie
tendered
chocolates
lilias
crocheted
her
a
pincushion
cover
and
bertha
painted
her
a
she
accepted
their
little
kindnesses
with
mild
astonishment
but
not
a
hint
of
the
real
reason
of
their
sudden
advances
flashed
across
her
mind
we
must
let
her
suspect

in

the

filled

with

it

she
declared

will
soon
be
quite

left
what
else
do
you
expect
asked
gowan
they
wo
keep
green
all
the
winter
i
suppose
not
but
in
sicily
we
have
so
many
evergreens

shrubs
that
flower
all
the
winter
the
oranges
and
lemons
begin
to
get
ripe
soon
after

and
we
have
agaves
and
prickly

everywhere
i
ca
imagine
a

without
any

till
you
see

there
generally

we
shall
have
a

we
ought
to
by
the

put

old
saying
that

foretell

we
rummage
up
all
the
old
charms
we
can

try
them
it
would
be
ever
such
fun
topping
only
let
us
keep
it
to
the
mafia
and
not
let
the
others
know
we
do
want
laurette
and
butting
in
the
remaining
members
of

when
consulted
received
the
idea
with
enthusiasm
there
is
a
vein
of
superstition
at
the
bottom
of
the
most
practical
among
us
and
all
of
them
were
well
accustomed
to
practise
such
rites
as
throwing
spilt
salt
over
the
left
shoulder
curtseying
to
the
new
moon
and
turning
their
money
when
they
heard
the
cuckoo
not
of

that
it
always
follows
said
prissie
on
easter
holidays
a
bird
used
to
come
and
tap
constantly
at
our
window
at
home
it
was
always
doing
it
of

that
means
death
in

her

everything
with

she
had
to

been
stored
in
the
loft
and
was
under
lock
and
key
some
minor
experiments
however
might
be
tried
with

skins
so
they
determined
to
pocket
their
next
dessert
and
keep
it
till
the

hour
of
divination
arrived

chestnuts
would
be
a
distinct
possibility
and
a
little
coaxing
at
would
doubtless
result
in
jones
the
gardener
bringing
a
bag
full
for
them
from
glazebrook
they
felt
quite
excited
when
the
fateful
day
arrived
miss
walters
had
made
no
objection
to
an
order
for
chestnuts
and
had
even
allowed
a
modicum
of
toffee
to
be
added
to
the
list
she
did
not
refer
to
the
subject
of
for
she
had
some
years
ago
suppressed
the
custom
of
bobbing
for
apples
finding
that
the
girls
invariably
got
their
hair
wet
and
had
colds
in
their
heads
in
consequence
the
members
of
the
mafia
well
stocked
therefore
with
the
apples
and
chestnuts
necessary
for
divination
remained
in
their
schoolroom
after
evening
preparation
so
as
to
have
a
gay
time
all
to
themselves
to
make
matters
more
thrillsome
they
turned
out
the
light
and
sat
in
the
flickering
glow
of
the
fire
gowan
having
the
largest
acquaintance
with
the
occult
not
to
speak
of
having
possessed
a
endowed
with
second
sight
was
universally
acknowledged
priestess
of
the
ceremonies
shall
we
begin
with
apples
or
chestnuts
she
asked
seriously
as
some
said
one
thing
and
some
another
she
held
a
specimen
of
each
behind
her
back
and
commanded
carmel
to
choose
right
hand
or
left
the
lot
fell
upon
chestnuts
and
these
were
placed
neatly
in
pairs
along
the
bars
of
the
grate
you
name
them
after
yourself
and
your
sweetheart
explained
gowan
if
he
pops
first
he
ask
you
to
marry
him
and
suppose
the
other
pops
first
asked
carmel
then
you
wo
marry
him
does
it
mean
that
it
may
be
leap
year
and
the
girl
will
the
question
asked
dulcie
still
giggling
no
it
does
suppose
they
neither
of
them
pop
said
prissie
it
a
sign
that
neither
cares
but
it
not
very
likely
to
happen
they
nearly
always
pop
i
pricked
mine
with
my
penknife
though
the
more
goose
you
take
them
back
and
try
two
fresh
ones
it
is
rather
a
delicate
and
process
to
balance
chestnuts
on
the
bars
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
prissie
tumbled
into
the
fire
and
could
not
be
rescued
the
party
was
obliged
to
watch
them
burn
they
helped
her
to
place
another
in
position
then
sat
round
keeping
careful
eyes
on
their
particular
representatives
it
was
forbidden
to
reveal
names
so
each
kept
the
identity
of
her
favored
swain
locked
in
her
breast
it
seemed
a
long
time
before
those
chestnuts
were
ready
love
delays
are
notoriously
hard
to
bear
never
were
omens
watched
so
anxiously
slap
bang
pop
at
last
came
from
particular
corner
and
fragments
flew
about
indiscriminately
on
to
hearth
and
fire
it
cried
gowan
ungrammatically
he
done
it
most
thoroughly
too
carmel
you
be
married
the
first
of
any
of
us
you
ask
us
to
the
wedding
wo
you
at
that
moment
a
chorus
of
pops
came
from
the
grate
causing
much
rejoicing
or
dismay
from
the
various
owners
of
the
chestnuts
according
to
the
fate
meted
out
to
them
by
the
omens
on
the
whole
cupid
was
kind
though
lilias
and
gowan
were
left
in
the
lurch
i
do
care
said
gowan
sturdily
i
another
in
my
mind
and
perhaps
i
shall
get
him
in
the
and
if
you
do
i
meet
somebody
else
later
on
having
eaten
more
or
less
charred
pieces
of
chestnut
the
girls
produced
their
apples
and
once
more
set
to
work
to
try
magic
the
apple
had
to
be
peeled
entirely
in
one
long
piece
which
must
then
be
slung
backwards
over
the
left
shoulder
on
to
the
floor
where
it
would
form
the
initial
of
the
future
lover
it
was
a
matter
for
skilful
manipulation
of
penknives
not
at
all
easy
to
manage
so
difficult
in
fact
that
noreen
and
dulcie
each
made
a
slip
and
chopped
their
precious
pieces
of
peel
in
the
middle
thus
rendering
them
useless
for
purposes
of
divination

essay
was
completely
puzzled
by
the
result
which
did
not
resemble
any
known
letter
in
the
alphabet
though
gowan
anxious
to
interpret
the
oracles
construed
it
into
a
edith
long
thin
piece
of
peel
made
a
plain
c
a
fact
which
seemed
to
cause
her
much
satisfaction
though
she
would
betray
no
names
prissie
broke
her
luck
in
half
in
the
very
act
of
flinging
it
but
insisted
that
the
two
separate
portions
each
formed
an
o
it
was
carmel
turn
next
and
her
rather
broad
piece
of
peel
twisted
itself
into
a
most
palpable
she
looked
at
it
for
a
moment
as
if
rather
taken
aback
then
her
face
cleared
there
are
quite
a
number
of
names
that
begin
with
e
she
remarked
enigmatically
now
it
was
all
very
well
to
sit
in
the
sanctuary
of
their
schoolroom
trying
such
mild
magic
as
divination
through
chestnuts
and
apple
skins
gowan
northern
blood
yearned
after
more
subtle
witchcraft
i
sha
be
content
till
i
pulled
a
cabbage
stalk
she
declared
i
do
see
why
we
need
wait
till
midnight
is
as
soon
as
it
dark
i
should
think
who
game
to
fly
up
the
what
now
why
not
we
should
only
be
gone
a
few
minutes
and
miss
hardy
would
never
find
out
it
really
would
be
a
frolicsome
joke
there
a
moon
too
i
vote
we
risk
it
come
along
nine
giggling
girls
therefore
stole
cautiously
downstairs
a
little
delayed
by
prissie
who
with
a
most
unusual
concern
for
her
health
insisted
on
fetching
a
wrap
they
opened
the
side
door
and
peeped
out
into
the
night
it
was
quite
fine
with
a
clear
full
moon
and
clouds
drifting
high
in
the
sky
the
vegetable
garden
was
so
near
that
the
ceremony
could
be
very
quickly
performed
it
was
of
course
breaking
rules
to
leave
the
house
after
dark
but
not
one
of
them
could
resist
the
temptation
so
out
they
sped
to
the
cabbage
patch
now
when
prissie
ran
to
her
bedroom
ostensibly
to
get
a
wrap
she
had
really
gone
with
quite
other
intentions
she
had
certainly
put
on
a
long
dark
coat
and
a
soft
felt
hat
but
the
whole
gist
of
the
matter
lay
in
something
that
she
slipped
into
her
pocket
it
was
a
black
mustache
that
she
had
brought
to
school
for
use
in
theatricals
and
lay
handy
in
her
top
drawer
she
had
hastily
smeared
the
under
side
of
it
with
soap
so
that
it
would
adhere
to
her
lip
and
once
out
in
the
garden
she
fell
behind
the
others
and
fixed
it
in
position
then
she
made
a
behind
some
bushes
so
as
to
conceal
herself
from
the
party
presently
under
the
bright
moon
and
scudding
clouds
eight
girls
were
hurriedly
pulling
away
at
cabbage
stalks
and
estimating
by
the
amount
of
earth
that
came
up
with
them
the
wealth
of
their
future
husbands
the
general
surroundings
and
the
associations
of
the
evening
were
sufficient
to
send
shivers
down
their
spines
gowan
looking
up
suddenly
saw
standing
among
the
bushes
a
dark
figure
with
a
heavy
black
mustache
and
she
caught
her
breath
with
a
gasp
and
clutched
at
carmel
arm
for
an
instant
eight
horrified
faces
stared
at
the
apparition
then
dulcie
made
a
dive
in
its
direction
and
dragged
forth
prissie
you
wretch
what
a
mean
trick
to
play
you
did
take
in
it
was
very
clever
though
you
really
looked
just
like
a
spook
take
it
off
now
no
said
prissie
leave
me
alone
i
have
finished
hush
i
believe
somebody
else
is
coming
to
try
the
ordeal
slip
behind
that
and
hide
and
let
us
see
who
it
is
quick
you
be
caught
the
girls
made
a
swift
but
silent
dash
for
the
shadow
of
the
and
concealed
themselves
only
just
in
time
they
were
barely
hidden
when
footsteps
resounded
on
the
gravel
and
a
figure
advanced
from
the
direction
of
the
house
it
came
alone
and
it
carried
something
in
its
hand
in
the
clear
beams
of
the
moonlight
the
mafia
had
no
difficulty
in
recognizing
laurette
and
could
see
that
what
she
bore
was
her
bedroom
mirror
they
chuckled
inwardly
most
evidently
she
had
sallied
forth
to
try
the
white
magic
of
and
to
make
the
spell
work
more
securely
had
come
alone
to
consult
the
cabbage
oracle
first
she
placed
her
mirror
on
the
ground
and
tilted
its
swing
glass
to
a
convenient
angle
at
which
to
catch
reflections
then
she
pulled
hard
at
a
stalk
looked
with
apparent
satisfaction
at
the
decidedly
thick
lumps
of
earth
that
adhered
which
if
the
magic
were
to
be
trusted
must
represent
a
considerable
fortune
then
clasping
her
cabbage
in
her
hand
knelt
down
in
front
of
the
and
began
to
mutter
something
to
herself
in
a
low
voice
her
back
was
towards
the
and
the
bushes
and
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
her
mirror
prissie
looking
on
realized
that
it
was
the
chance
of
a
lifetime
she
stole
on
tiptoe
from
her
retreat
and
peeped
over
laurette
shoulder
so
that
her
reflection
should
be
displayed
in
the
glass
laurette
seeing
suddenly
a
most
unexpected
vision
of
a
dark
mustache
literally
yelled
with
fright
sprang
up
and
turned
round
to
face
her
spook
then
with
a
further
scream
dashed
down
the
garden
towards
the
house
the
mafia
rising
from
the
shadow
of
the
laughed
long
though
with
caution
what
an
absolutely
topping
joke
whispered
dulcie
illustration
she
peeped
over
laurette
shoulder
and
on
laurette
of
all
people
in
this
wide
world
rejoiced
bertha
prissie
you
play
up
no
end
i
flatter
myself
i
made
her
squeal
and
run
smirked
prissie
it
just
serves
her
right
i
was
longing
for
a
chance
to
get
even
with
her
what
about
the
asked
carmel
wo
some
of
them
be
coming
out
to
fetch
it
yes
of
course
they
will
we
must
take
it
in
at
once
let
us
scoot
round
the
other
way
and
go
in
by
the
back
door
before
laurette
and
catch
us
prissie
seized
the
mirror
and
the
nine
girls
fled
by
another
path
to
the
door
near
the
kitchen
where
by
great
good
luck
they
avoided
meeting
any
of
the
servants
and
were
able
to
bolt
upstairs
unseen
the
gold
bedroom
was
empty
no
doubt
its
occupants
were
shivering
at
the
side
door
so
they
were
able
to
restore
the
to
its
place
on
the
as
a
surprise
for
laurette
when
she
returned
whether
she
suspected
them
or
not
it
was
impossible
to
tell
for
she
kept
her
own
counsel
and
though
next
day
they
referred
casually
to
observances
she
only
glanced
at
them
with
eyelids
and
remarked
that
was
quite
above
such
silly
superstitions
which
is
more
than
a
fiblet
and
about
the
biggest
whopper
that
miss
laurette
aitken
has
ever
told
in
her
life
declared
prissie
still
chuckling
gleefully
at
the
remembrance
of
the
startled
figure
fleeing
down
the
garden
chapter
xiii
the
all
saints
brought
a
brief
spell
of
golden
weather
a
snatch
of
indian
summer
as
if
persephone
loth
to
go
down
into
the
underworld
had
managed
to
steal
a
few
days
extra
leave
from
pluto
and
had
remained
to
scatter
some
last
flowers
on
earth
before
her
long
banishment
from
the
sunshine
under
the
sheltered
brick
wall
in
the
czar
violets
were
blooming
sweet
and
fragrant
as
those
of
spring
the
rose
trees
had
burst
out
into
a
second
crop
and
the
chrysanthemums
were
such
a
special
show
that
miss
walters
almost
shook
hands
with
jones
the
gardener
over
them
little
wild
flowers
blossomed
on
in
quiet
nooks
at
the
edge
of
the
shrubbery
and
butterflies
brought
out
by
the
bright
days
made
a
last
flutter
in
the
sunshine
the
leaves
which
carmel
had
grieved
so
much
to
see
fall
lay
crisp
and
golden
on
the
ground
but
the
bare
boughs
of
the
trees
somewhat
to
her
surprise
held
a
beauty
of
form
and
tint
quite
their
own
they
are
all
sorts
of
lovely
soft
delicate
colors
she
remarked
quite
different
from
trees
in
sicily
i
think
it
must
be
the
damp
in
the
air
here
that
does
it
everything
seems
seen
through
a
blue
haze
a
kind
of
fairy
glamour
that
makes
them
different
from
what
they
are
wait
till
you
see
them
on
a
sousing
wet
december
morning
declared
gowan
you
wo
find
much
romance
about
them
then
but
in
the
meantime
we
enjoy
them
said
miss
walters
who
happened
to
overhear
who
votes
for
a
walk
this
afternoon
anybody
who
prefers
to
stop
at
home
and
write
french
translation
may
do
so
the
girls
grinned
miss
walters
did
not
often
give
them
an
unexpected
holiday
so
such
treats
were
appreciated
when
they
came
enthusiasts
donned
strong
boots
jerseys
and
and
started
forth
for
a
ramble
on
the
they
had
climbed
through
the
wood
and
were
walking
along
the
upper
road
that
led
to
the
hamlet
of
five
stone
bridge
when
they
came
face
to
face
with
a
very
curious
little
cavalcade
two
large
soap
boxes
knocked
together
had
been
placed
on
old
perambulator
wheels
and
in
this
roughly
fashioned
chariot
on
a
bundle
of
straw
and
an
old
shawl
reclined
a
little
thin
girl
one
sturdy
boy
of
ten
was
pushing
the
queer
conveyance
while
a
younger
pulled
it
by
a
piece
of
rope
and
the
small
occupant
her
lap
full
of
flowers
smiled
as
proudly
as
a
queen
on
coronation
day
against
the
background
of
green
hedgerow
and
red
village
roofs
the
happy
children
made
a
charming
picture
they
had
not
noticed
the
approach
of
the
school
and
were
laughing
together
in
absolute
unconsciousness
the
sight
of
them
at
that
particular
moment
was
one
of
those
brief
glimpses
into
the
heart
of
other
folks
lives
that
only
come
to
us
on
chance
occasions
when
by
some
accident
we
peep
over
the
wall
of
human
reserve
into
the
inner
circle
of
thought
and
feeling
almost
with
one
accord
the
girls
stopped
and
smiled
i
wish
i
brought
my
camera
murmured
dulcie
they
too
sweet
for
words
agreed
prissie
miss
walters
spoke
to
the
children
asked
their
names
and
ascertained
that
the
little
girl
had
been
ill
for
a
long
time
and
could
not
walk
they
were
shy
however
and
all
the
spontaneous
gladness
that
had
made
the
first
snapshot
view
of
them
so
charming
faded
away
in
the
presence
of
strangers
they
accepted
some
pieces
of
chocolate
and
remained
by
the
hedge
bank
staring
with
solemn
eyes
as
the
line
of
the
school
filed
away
the
chance
meeting
was
no
doubt
an
event
on
both
sides
the
children
would
tell
their
mother
about
the
ladies
who
had
spoken
to
them
and
the
girls
on
their
part
could
not
forget
the
pretty
episode
they
urged
miss
walters
to
make
some
inquiries
about
the
family
and
found
that
little
phyllis
was
suffering
from
hip
disease
and
had
been
for
a
short
time
in
the
local
hospital
then
an
idea
sprang
up
amongst
the
girls
it
was
impossible
to
say
quite
where
it
originated
for
at
least
five
girls
claimed
the
honor
of
it
but
it
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
that
chilcombe
school
should
raise
a
subscription
and
buy
an
adequate
carriage
for
the
small
invalid
that
terrible
box
must
shake
her
to
pieces
poor
kid
it
had
no
springs
she
looked
so
sweet
but
as
white
as
a
daisy
would
she
be
proud
of
a
real
proper
carriage
ca
we
write
off
and
order
one
at
once
what
would
it
cost
let
get
up
a
concert
or
something
for
it
oh
yes
that
would
be
ever
such
sport
miss
walters
on
being
appealed
to
was
cautious
caution
was
one
of
her
strong
characteristics
and
would
not
commit
herself
to
any
reply
until
she
had
consulted
the
doctor
who
attended
the
child
the
clergyman
of
the
parish
and
the
local
schoolmaster
armed
with
this
accumulated
information
she
visited
the
mother
then
gave
a
report
of
her
interview
they
not
well
off
but
we
must
on
any
account
pauperize
them
was
her
verdict
cranley
says
an
invalid
carriage
would
be
a
great
boon
to
the
child
but
suggests
that
the
parents
should
pay
half
the
expense
they
would
value
it
far
more
if
they
did
so
than
if
it
were
entirely
a
gift
he
knows
of
a
wicker
carriage
that
could
be
had
cheap
it
belongs
to
another
patient
of
his
and
he
saw
it
at
their
house
only
the
other
day
if
you
girls
can
manage
to
raise
about
the
parents
would
do
the
rest
he
was
mentioning
the
subject
of
a
carriage
to
them
a
short
time
ago
and
they
said
they
could
afford
something
but
not
the
full
price
he
thinks
this
would
settle
the
matter
to
everybody
satisfaction
cranley
proposal
suited
the
girls
for
was
a
sum
that
seemed
quite
feasible
to
collect
among
themselves
they
determined
however
to
get
as
much
fun
out
of
the
business
as
possible
do
let
have
a
horrid
subscription
list
urged
lilias
it
so
unutterably
dull
just
to
put
down
your
name
for
half
a
crown
i
hoped
we
were
going
to
give
a
concert
what
i
vote
said
gowan
is
that
each
bedroom
should
have
a
show
of
its
own
ask
the
others
to
come
as
audience
charge
admission
and
wangle
the
cash
that
way
there
be
some
sport
in
that
agreed
lilias
it
great
declared
dulcie
you
bet
it
will
catch
on
purred
prissie
gowan
scheme
undoubtedly
caught
on
it
was
so
attractive
that
there
was
no
resisting
it
even
the
occupants
of
the
gold
bedroom
who
as
a
rule
were
not
too
ready
to
receive
suggestions
from
the
blue
grotto
could
not
find
a
single
fault
and
plumped
solidly
for
a
dramatic
performance
each
dormitory
was
to
give
any
entertainment
it
chose
and
while
the
brown
room
decided
on
nigger
minstrels
and
the
green
room
on
a
general
variety
program
the
blue
gold
and
rose
were
keen
on
acting
miss
walters
who
of
course
had
to
be
consulted
not
only
gave
a
smiling
permission
but
seemed
on
the
very
verge
of
suggesting
a
personal
attendance
then
noticing
the
look
of
polite
agony
which
swept
over
the
faces
of
the
deputation
kindly
backed
out
from
such
an
evidently
embarrassing
proposal
and
declared
that
she
and
the
mistresses
would
be
too
busy
to
come
and
must
leave
the
girls
to
manage
by
themselves
thank
goodness
exclaimed
gowan
when
they
were
safely
out
of
earshot
of
the
study
door
i
never
dreamt
of
such
an
awful
thing
as
miss
walters
offering
to
turn
up
why
we
could
have
had
any
fun
at
all
we
have
had
to
act
shakespeare
or
something
stilted
out
of
a
book
shuddered
edith
i
should
simply
shut
up
if
any
of
the
mistresses
were
looking
on
protested
dulcie
and
i
should
shut
down
and
crawl
under
a
bed
i
think
laughed
noreen
i
say
i
hope
miss
walters
was
offended
we
certainly
looked
very
blank
when
she
began
asking
us
the
price
of
i
suppose
it
was
exactly
what
you
call
polite
perhaps
it
was
but
it
ca
be
helped
groaned
gowan
it
would
wreck
everything
to
have
an
audience
of
mistresses
i
feel
we
escaped
a
great
danger
we
must
warn
the
others
not
to
be
too
encouraging
or
give
the
mistresses
any
loophole
of
an
excuse
to
butt
in
this
particular
show
is
to
be
private
and
confidential
it
was
decided
to
hold
each
performance
on
a
separate
day
during
the
evening
recreation
time
are
no
good
decreed
prissie
everybody
feels
perfectly
cold
in
the
afternoon
it
impossible
to
get
up
any
proper
enthusiasm
until
the
lamps
are
lighted
i
feel
a
perfect
stick
at
admitted
carmel
what
will
you
feel
later
on
a
sort
of
combination
of
mary
pickford
and
charlie
chaplin
thrown
together
i
hope
twinkled
carmel
it
depends
whether
you
put
me
on
a
comic
turn
or
a
romantic
scene
i
vote
we
have
a
little
bit
of
both
said
gowan
we
harrow
their
feelings
first
and
end
in
comedy
the
five

monica
we
are
sending
dorothea
down
to
you
by
the
first
train
in
the
morning
and
we
beg
you
will
keep
a
strict
eye
on
her
an
individual
named
montague
ponsonby
has
been
paying
her
great
attentions
and
we
wish
to
break
off
the
attachment
he
is
well
born
but
absolutely
penniless
and
as
dorothea
will
some
day
be
an
heiress
we
do
not
wish
her
to
throw
herself
away
upon
him
please
do
your
best
to
prevent
any
such
folly
your
affectionate
sister
elizabeth
strong
miss
morton
on
grasping
the
drift
of
this
epistle
exhibited
symptoms
of
distress
she
flung
out
her
arms
in
a
dramatic
attitude
and
confided
to
the
audience
her
disinclination
to
take
over
the
unwelcome
task
of
becoming
duenna
to
her
niece
there
was
no
other
course
open
to
her
apparently
the
idea
of
sending
the
girl
home
by
the
next
train
or
of
hastily
packing
her
own
box
and
departing
somewhere
on
urgent
business
did
not
seem
to
occur
to
her
she
grumbled
but
accepted
the
responsibility
and
jemima
the
pert
maidservant
made
faces
behind
her
back
till
summoned
by
a
violent
knocking
when
she
flew
to
the
door
and
admitted
dorothea
with
bag
and
baggage
lilias
as
the
fashionable
niece
was
got
up
regardless
her
hair
was
done
in
a
grecian
knot
a
veil
was
twisted
round
her
picture
hat
and
she
sailed
into
the
room
with
the
assurance
of
a
society
beauty
aunt
monica
suppressing
the
letter
of
warning
gave
the
customary
greetings
then
with
the
imprudence
characteristic
of
a
stage
aunt
announced
her
intention
of
going
out
to
do
shopping
while
her
niece
unpacked
her
possessions
instead
of
doing
anything
so
sensible
as
to
unpack
dorothea
sank
into
a
chair
and
in
an
attitude
of
great
languor
and
despair
confided
her
love
affairs
to
the
sympathetic
and
interested
servant
who
swore
fealty
and
offered
all
possible
assistance
her
kind
intentions
were
put
at
once
to
the
test
for
immediately
another
violent
knocking
was
heard
she
flung
open
the
door
and
after
a
whispered
colloquy
announced
montague
ponsonby
the
entrance
of
carmel
as
hero
of
the
drama
created
quite
a
sensation
materials
for
masculine
attire
were
scanty
at
chilcombe
hall
and
as
the
girls
felt
rather
mean
for
not
having
invited
the
mistresses
to
their
performance
they
had
not
dared
to
ask
for
the
loan
of
any
theatrical
properties
and
had
been
obliged
to
concoct
costumes
from
anything
that
came
to
hand
carmel
had
put
her
feet
through
the
sleeves
of
her
brown
knitted
jumper
and
drawn
it
up
so
that
the
cuffs
fitted
just
below
her
knees
and
made
a
really
striking
resemblance
to
a
pair
of
gentleman
sporting
breeches
a
coat
covered
any
deficiencies
at
the
waist
a
paper
collar
and
a
scarlet
tie
encircled
her
throat
waders
did
service
for
her
hair
was
tucked
under
a
felt
hat
with
the
trimming
wrenched
off
and
last
but
not
least
her
lip
was
adorned
with
the
black
mustache
which
prissie
had
used
on
she
looked
such
a
magnificent
and
sporting
object
that
it
was
no
wonder
the
fashionable
dorothea
fell
into
her
arms
it
is
perhaps
unusual
for
a
gentleman
to
conduct
his
with
his
hat
on
but
the
audience
was
not
and
allowed
some
latitude
to
montague
ponsonby
they
admired
the
ardor
with
which
he
pressed
his
suit
the
fervor
of
his
protestations
of
fidelity
the
dramatic
roll
of
his
dark
eyes
and
the
tender
tone
of
his
voice
his
entrance
was
considered
a
very
brisk
bit
of
acting
and
when
he
paused
for
breath
in
a
graceful
stage
attitude
sixteen
pairs
of
hands
gave
a
hearty
clap
the
lovers
possibly
a
little
sated
with
the
ecstacies
of
their
affection
turned
to
the
sordid
details
of
life
and
sitting
hand
in
hand
upon
the
sofa
improvised
out
of
four
bedroom
chairs
and
an
eiderdown
planned
an
immediate
elopement
they
had
decided
to
hire
a
car
and
make
for
scotland
and
were
discussing
which
hotel
to
stay
at
and
what
they
should
order
for
dinner
when
the
inevitable
happened
the
pert
maidservant
rushed
in
and
in
a
voice
squeaky
with
tragedy
warned
them
of
the
immediate
approach
of
miss
monica
morton
of
course
they
ought
to
have
expected
it
nobody
except
two
utter
idiots
would
have
sat
philandering
upon
the
sofa
in
what
might
be
termed
the
lion
den
knowing
that
the
lion
might
at
any
moment
walk
in
with
her
and
catch
them
the
surprise
and
horror
depicted
on
their
countenances
would
have
commanded
a
good
salary
at
a
cinema
studio
montague
ponsonby
was
for
bluffing
it
but
astute
female
brains
seized
a
readier
way
out
of
the
situation
she
laid
her
lover
flat
upon
the
sofa
and
covered
him
hastily
with
her
traveling
rug
then
opening
her
suitcase
flung
its
contents
on
the
floor
and
knelt
down
in
the
midst
of
a
muddle
of
shoes
nightdresses
and
other
paraphernalia
aunt
monica
exhibited
a
natural
amazement
at
finding
her
niece
conducting
her
unpacking
in
the
instead
of
upstairs
but
accepted
her
explanations
with
wonderful
indulgence
she
professed
herself
tired
with
shopping
and
moved
towards
the
sofa
to
rest
dorothea
with
sudden
solicitude
sprang
up
to
offer
her
a
chair
and
made
every
human
effort
to
lead
her
away
from
the
couch
she
was
a
persistent
not
to
say
obstinate
old
lady
however
and
she
meant
to
have
her
own
way
in
her
own
house
waving
her
niece
aside
and
proclaiming
her
weariness
she
sank
down
heavily
upon
the
sofa
the
result
was
tragic
for
a
stifled
groan
resounded
through
the
room
and
the
of
the
luckless
montague
ponsonby
kicked
wildly
in
the
air
miss
morton
naturally
alarmed
and
instantly
jumping
to
the
conclusion
that
he
was
a
burglar
screamed
loudly
for
assistance
and
a
passing
policeman
hastened
to
her
call
it
is
wonderful
how
efficient
and
handy
the
police
always
are
on
the
stage
they
are
invariably
at
the
right
place
at
the
right
moment
and
always
step
in
just
in
time
to
stop
a
murder
prevent
an
explosion
or
rescue
the
heroine
dulcie
who
in
a
long
blue
coat
with
a
paper
helmet
and
a
strap
under
her
chin
represented
the
majesty
of
the
law
hauled
the
squirming
montague
from
the
couch
and
secured
his
wrists
tightly
with
a
piece
of
clothes
line
supplied
by
the
pert
servant
who
ought
to
have
been
ashamed
of
herself
for
going
back
on
her
promise
to
help
the
lovers
but
probably
felt
a
deeper
obligation
to
the
policeman
who
was
no
doubt
her
sweetheart
which
accounted
for
his
very
convenient
presence
on
the
doorstep
i
arrest
you
in
the
king
name
declared
that
officer
when
the
clothes
line
was
sufficiently
knotted
and
montague
had
ceased
struggling
you
will
be
brought
up
on
trial
before
the
court
and
charged
with
and
resisting
the
police
it
was
only
then
that
the
wretched
man
began
to
protest
his
innocence
and
that
dorothea
falling
on
her
knees
explained
his
name
errand
and
intentions
and
entreated
her
aunt
to
overlook
the
matter
miss
morton
wavered
visibly
it
was
evident
that
her
natural
kindness
of
heart
gave
her
a
bias
towards
the
lovers
she
had
perhaps
been
through
an
affair
of
the
same
sort
herself
in
her
youth
yet
on
the
other
hand
her
duty
to
her
sister
urged
her
to
take
stern
measures
she
drew
the
letter
from
her
pocket
with
the
seeming
intention
of
strengthening
her
resolution
against
the
hopes
of
montague
and
was
shaking
her
head
sadly
over
it
when
the
obstreperous
servant
who
had
rushed
for
no
apparent
reason
except
habit
to
the
door
bounded
back
waving
a
yellow
envelope
a
maid
usually
presents
a
telegram
upon
a
tray
but
miss
morton
must
have
been
accustomed
to
jemima
rough
ways
or
was
too
agitated
to
rebuke
her
she
tore
open
the
missive
glanced
at
its
contents
and
with
a
scream
of
joy
sank
fainting
into
her
faithful
arms
of
course
somebody
had
to
read
the
telegram
aloud
the
policeman
seemed
to
think
it
was
his
business
he
picked
it
up
and
proclaimed
it
in
the
manner
of
a
town
crier
it
was
short
but
much
to
the
point
please
encourage
montague
ponsonby
uncle
has
died
and
left
him
vast
fortune
elizabeth
everybody
recovered
at
the
good
news
miss
morton
rose
from
the
arms
of
jemima
apologized
to
ponsonby
for
having
mistaken
him
for
a
burglar
and
invited
him
to
stay
to
lunch
he
begged
her
not
to
mention
the
matter
and
as
soon
as
his
wrists
had
been
released
by
the
policeman
he
shook
hands
cordially
with
his
prospective
aunt
and
made
a
pretty
speech
expressing
his
desire
to
become
a
member
of
the
family
this
was
undoubtedly
the
moment
for
the
curtain
to
descend
but
as
that
most
useful
of
stage
adjuncts
was
conspicuous
by
its
absence
the
actors
lined
up
instead
and
made
their
parting
bows
with
much
éclat
dorothea
leaning
elegantly
upon
her
lover
shoulder
aunt
monica
holding
aloft
the
telegram
the
policeman
saluting
and
the
maidservant
blowing
kisses
the
applause
was
so
thunderous
that
the
performers
were
obliged
to
beg
the
audience
to
use
and
limit
the
noise
for
fear
one
of
the
mistresses
should
feel
in
duty
bound
to
pay
a
surprise
visit
and
be
scandalized
at
the
costumes
moreover
a
clanging
bell
warned
them
that
the
recreation
hour
was
over
so
there
was
a
hasty
exit
and
a
quick
change
into
normal
garments
miss
hardy
was
kind
that
evening
and
turned
a
blind
eye
to
deficiencies
of
order
she
was
seen
surreptitiously
reading
the
program
and
it
was
the
general
opinion
in
the
dormitory
that
she
and
the
other
mistresses
were
much
disappointed
at
having
been
excluded
from
the
entertainment
it
did
seem
rather
mean
not
to
ask
them
said
gowan
though
they
have
spoilt
the
whole
show
i
vote
we
give
another
some
time
a
prunes
and
prism
affair
without
any
lovers
in
it
and
let
them
all
come
right
you
are
but
it
will
be
a
tame
business
after
this
agreed
bertha
chapter
xiv
all
in
a
mist
the
blue
grotto
entertainment
was
very
successfully
emulated
by
the
occupants
of
the
gold
green
rose
and
brown
bedrooms
and
quite
a
sufficient
sum
of
money
was
raised
in
the
various
collections
to
pay
half
the
expense
of
the
little
wicker
carriage
for
the
invalid
child
the
school
took
a
special
walk
one
day
to
five
stone
bridge
to
see
her
take
an
airing
in
her
new
chariot
and
though
they
agreed
that
it
did
not
look
nearly
so
picturesque
as
the
wooden
box
it
was
undoubtedly
far
more
comfortable
and
more
suitable
for
one
suffering
from
her
complaint
she
smiled
shyly
at
the
long
line
of
girls
whispered
a
bashful
thank
you
for
the
chocolates
they
gave
her
and
appeared
scared
to
the
verge
of
tears
when
they
spoke
to
her
i
do
blame
her
poor
kid
said
gowan
as
the
school
marched
on
slightly
disappointed
i
should
like
to
be
made
a
show
of
myself
and
be
stared
at
by
everybody
she
looked
as
if
she
wished
us
far
enough
never
mind
she
eat
the
chocs
and
enjoy
herself
now
gone
she
rather
a
sweet
little
morsel
is
she
after
all
christmas
was
drawing
near
and
the
school
turned
from
schemes
of
general
philanthropy
to
the
more
pressing
business
of
making
presents
for
immediate
relatives
and
friends
various
pieces
of
sewing
which
had
languished
all
the
term
were
taken
out
and
worked
at
feverishly
there
was
quite
an
epidemic
of
needlecraft
and
a
wet
day
was
almost
welcomed
as
affording
an
opportunity
for
getting
on
with
the
gifts
everybody
seemed
suddenly
in
need
of
embroidery
silks
transfers
beads
wools
crochet
needles
and
other
such
articles
and
a
special
deputation
waited
on
miss
walters
asking
permission
to
go
a
shopping
expedition
to
glazebrook
to
purchase
these
indispensables
miss
walters
who
always
had
an
eye
to
school
discipline
made
the
matter
a
question
of
marks
and
granted
the
privilege
only
to
those
whose
exercise
books
showed
a
certain
standard
of
proficiency
hester
ida
noreen
joyce
bertha
carmel
and
doris
were
the
only
ones
who
reached
the
required
totals
so
under
charge
of
miss
herbert
they
were
sent
off
one
afternoon
to
the
town
armed
with
a
long
list
of
commissions
from
the
luckless
ones
who
remained
behind
chilcombe
hall
was
four
and
a
half
miles
from
glazebrook
and
there
was
no
motor
omnibus
service
it
was
arranged
therefore
for
the
party
to
walk
on
the
outward
journey
and
to
return
with
all
their
parcels
in
a
couple
of
taxicabs
they
started
after
an
extremely
early
lunch
in
order
to
do
the
important
business
of
matching
embroidery
silks
by
daylight
it
had
been
quite
a
fine
sunny
morning
but
clouded
over
at
noon
and
although
no
rain
fell
the
sky
was
gray
and
cheerless
the
girls
did
not
much
mind
the
condition
of
the
weather
so
long
as
they
could
see
to
make
their
purchases
they
spent
a
considerable
time
in
the
principal
shop
of
the
town
and
tried
the
patience
of
the
assistants
by
demanding
articles
that
were
quite
unobtainable
a
visit
to
a
stationer
and
a
confectioner
almost
completed
their
list
of
requirements
and
only
a
few
extras
remained
to
be
bought
some
of
the
party
were
standing
in
the
entrance
of
a
big
general
store
waiting
while
miss
herbert
executed
commissions
for
miss
walters
when
joyce
was
suddenly
greeted
by
a
friend
a
lady
who
was
just
about
to
step
into
her
motor
why
joyce
she
exclaimed
have
you
been
shopping
here
so
have
i
look
at
my
pile
of
parcels
have
you
finished
are
you
going
straight
back
to
school
i
shall
pass
chilcombe
on
my
way
home
and
can
take
you
in
the
car
if
you
like
and
some
of
your
schoolfellows
too
room
for
four
if
you
do
mind
squeezing
it
seemed
much
too
good
an
offer
to
be
refused
joyce
suggested
indeed
that
she
ought
to
consult
miss
herbert
who
was
in
an
upper
department
of
the
shop
but
baldwin
declared
she
could
not
wait
i
do
see
that
miss
herbert
can
mind
we
quite
ready
to
go
and
it
will
save
one
taxi
urged
bertha
so
it
was
hastily
decided
for
joyce
bertha
doris
and
carmel
to
go
in
the
car
and
noreen
ran
upstairs
to
tell
miss
herbert
of
the
arrangement
the
latter
with
hester
and
ida
was
choosing
and
fancy
candlesticks
it
was
only
when
noreen
had
gone
that
carmel
remembered
suddenly
that
she
had
never
bought
the
packet
of
chocolates
which
she
had
promised
to
bring
back
for
dulcie
she
stopped
with
her
foot
on
the
step
of
the
car
and
excused
herself
there
something
i
still
have
to
do
she
explained
i
must
come
back
in
the
taxi
with
the
others
after
all
i
so
sorry
baldwin
had
an
appointment
at
home
and
was
impatient
to
start
so
the
door
was
slammed
on
joyce
bertha
and
doris
and
they
drove
away
all
smiles
and
waving
a
through
the
window
there
was
a
sweets
department
close
at
hand
in
the
stores
and
carmel
bought
a
present
of
chocolate
for
dulcie
and
of
butterscotch
for
lilias
then
went
upstairs
to
the
counter
to
rejoin
miss
herbert
and
the
other
girls
to
her
surprise
she
found
they
had
gone
she
searched
for
them
all
round
the
upper
story
of
the
shop
but
did
not
see
them
anywhere
she
had
kept
a
watchful
eye
on
the
stairs
when
buying
the
sweets
and
was
quite
sure
that
they
had
not
passed
down
while
she
was
there
she
returned
to
the
counter
and
questioned
the
assistant
who
told
her
that
she
had
noticed
the
lady
and
the
three
girls
in
school
hats
walk
down
another
staircase
which
led
to
a
side
door
of
the
stores
in
much
alarm
carmel
hurried
that
way
into
the
street
but
not
a
trace
of
them
was
to
be
seen
she
walked
as
far
as
the
railway
station
hoping
to
catch
them
there
engaging
a
taxi
but
not
a
solitary
conveyance
of
any
description
was
on
the
stand
she
was
indeed
in
a
fix
she
saw
clearly
that
of
course
they
all
supposed
she
had
gone
with
baldwin
in
the
car
and
by
this
time
they
were
probably
on
the
road
to
chilcombe
without
her
it
was
nobody
fault
but
her
own
the
feeling
that
she
had
only
herself
to
blame
did
not
make
the
situation
any
less
unpleasant
she
was
four
and
a
half
miles
away
from
school
and
unless
she
could
secure
a
taxi
she
would
be
obliged
to
walk
back
she
inquired
from
a
porter
but
he
shook
his
head
and
said
it
was
unlikely
there
would
be
any
cabs
at
the
station
till
the
express
came
in
at
six
carmel
thanked
him
and
turned
away
with
her
eyes
full
of
tears
owing
to
her
sicilian
education
she
was
not
accustomed
to
going
about
by
herself
england
was
still
more
or
less
of
a
strange
country
to
her
and
she
did
not
know
the
ways
of
the
land
lilias
in
her
place
would
have
gone
to
the
principal
hotel
explained
who
she
was
and
asked
the
manager
to
find
some
sort
of
carriage
to
convey
her
back
to
school
such
a
course
never
occurred
to
carmel
however
instead
she
tied
her
numerous
parcels
together
blinked
back
her
tears
set
her
teeth
and
started
forth
to
walk
fortunately
there
was
no
mistaking
the
high
road
and
it
was
still
comparatively
early
if
she
put
her
best
foot
foremost
she
might
reasonably
expect
to
reach
chilcombe
before
dark
she
had
soon
left
the
houses
of
glazebrook
behind
and
was
passing
between
hedges
and
fields
for
the
first
mile
and
a
half
all
went
well
she
was
a
little
tired
but
rather
pleased
with
her
own
pluck
according
to
sicilian
customs
which
are
almost
eastern
in
their
guardianship
of
signorinas
it
was
an
thing
for
a
young
lady
in
her
position
to
take
a
country
walk
without
an
escort
the
remembrance
of
the
beggars
and
footpads
that
lurked
about
sicilian
roads
gave
her
uneasy
twinges
and
though
she
had
been
told
of
the
comparative
safety
of
british
highways
her
heart
beat
considerably
when
she
passed
anybody
and
she
scurried
along
in
a
flutter
lest
some
person
should
stop
and
speak
to
her
the
farther
she
went
from
the
town
the
fewer
people
were
on
the
road
and
for
quite
half
a
mile
she
had
met
nobody
at
all
she
had
been
going
steadily
down
a
steep
hill
and
at
the
bottom
she
stepped
suddenly
into
a
great
belt
of
fog
that
lay
like
a
white
wall
in
front
of
her
it
was
as
if
she
had
passed
into
a
country
of
dreams
she
could
scarcely
see
the
hedges
and
all
round
was
a
dense
mass
of
mist
clammy
and
cold
and
difficult
to
breathe
it
was
silent
too
for
no
sound
seemed
to
travel
through
it
not
a
bird
twittered
and
no
animal
stirred
in
the
fields
carmel
felt
as
utterly
alone
as
if
she
were
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
all
the
familiar
objects
of
the
landscape
were
blotted
out
it
was
still
light
but
this
white
thick
mist
was
worse
than
darkness
she
stamped
along
for
the
sake
of
hearing
her
own
footsteps
she
wished
she
had
a
dog
with
her
she
kept
to
the
side
of
the
road
and
followed
the
hedge
hoping
that
the
fog
was
only
in
the
valley
and
that
she
would
soon
pass
out
of
it
on
and
on
it
stretched
however
till
she
must
have
been
walking
through
it
for
quite
twenty
minutes
then
she
began
to
grow
uneasy
there
was
a
border
of
grass
under
the
hedge
bank
wider
than
she
remembered
noticing
on
the
road
and
the
suspicion
assailed
her
that
all
unknowingly
she
must
have
turned
down
a
side
lane
and
have
lost
her
way
she
went
forward
now
with
doubting
footsteps
where
was
the
path
leading
her
if
she
could
only
find
some
cottage
she
could
inquire
but
there
was
no
human
habitation
nothing
but
the
endless
hedges
and
an
occasional
gate
into
a
field
what
was
that
in
front
of
her
she
stopped
and
drew
back
with
a
cry
of
fear
across
her
track
gleamed
water
she
had
almost
stepped
into
it
whether
it
was
stream
pond
or
river
the
thick
mist
did
not
reveal
but
it
certainly
barred
her
footpath
she
shivered
and
turning
round
walked
back
in
the
direction
from
which
she
had
come
hoping
to
regain
the
high
road
then
a
wonderful
atmospheric
effect
was
displayed
a
breeze
sprang
up
and
blew
aside
some
of
the
fog
and
the
rising
moon
shone
down
on
a
land
of
white
shadows
it
was
impossible
to
tell
what
was
real
and
what
was
unreal
on
the
other
side
of
the
lane
stretched
what
appeared
to
be
a
vast
lake
but
might
only
be
mist
on
the
meadows
masses
shaped
themselves
into
spectral
forms
and
rolled
away
into
the
dim
and
nebulous
distance
where
they
settled
into
weird
domes
and
towers
and
walls
a
veritable
elf
king
castle
it
was
so
uncanny
and
silent
and
strange
that
carmel
was
far
more
frightened
than
she
had
felt
before
old
fairy
tales
of
her
childhood
crowded
into
her
mind
memories
of
phantoms
and
ghosts
and
goblins
the
legends
of
undine
and
the
water
sprites
the
ballad
of
the
in
the
haunted
forest
she
had
learnt
the
poem
once
and
she
found
herself
repeating
the
words
trembles
my
darling
why
shrinks
he
with
fear
father
my
father
the
is
near
the
with
his
crown
and
his
beard
long
and
white
your
eyes
are
deceived
by
the
vapours
of
night
love
thee
i
dote
on
thy
face
so
divine
i
must
and
will
have
thee
and
force
makes
thee
mine
father
my
father
oh
hold
me
now
fast
he
pulls
me
he
hurts
and
will
have
me
at
last
and
as
if
that
were
not
bad
enough
the
ballad
of
lenore
recurred
to
her
how
swift
the
flood
the
mead
the
wood
aright
aleft
are
gone
the
bridges
thunder
as
they
pass
but
earthly
sound
is
none
tramp
tramp
across
the
land
they
speed
splash
splash
across
the
sea
the
dead
can
ride
apace
dost
fear
to
ride
with
me
by
this
time
carmel
alone
among
the
magic
mist
and
moonlight
had
reached
a
state
of
fear
bordering
on
panic
she
longed
for
anything
human
and
would
have
embraced
a
cow
if
she
had
met
one
through
the
fog
in
front
of
her
suddenly
loomed
something
dark
and
the
sound
of
hoofs
rang
on
the
road
a
wild
vision
of
lenore
spectral
bridegroom
presented
itself
to
her
overwrought
imagination
and
she
shrieked
in
genuine
terror
and
shrank
trembling
against
the
hedge
the
rider
of
the
horse
dismounted
and
slipping
his
wrist
through
the
bridle
came
towards
her
what
the
matter
he
asked
are
you
hurt
why
great
scott
never
carmel
everard
everard
gasped
carmel
clinging
desperately
to
his
arm
oh
thank
heaven
it
you
i
lost
everard
comforted
her
for
a
while
without
asking
any
questions
then
when
she
had
recovered
calmness
he
naturally
wished
to
know
why
his
pretty
cousin
was
wandering
in
the
country
lanes
by
herself
on
a
winter
evening
he
blamed
the
school
instead
of
carmel
they
ought
to
have
taken
better
care
of
you
he
murmured
why
the
mistress
hold
a
and
count
you
all
it
was
her
fault
it
was
my
own
mistake
well
whoever
fault
it
was
the
fact
remains
the
same
you
better
get
on
rajah
and
i
take
you
back
to
chilcombe
oh
that
would
be
lovely
i
so
tired
perched
on
rajah
back
with
everard
walking
by
her
side
life
seemed
a
very
different
affair
from
what
it
had
been
five
minutes
before
carmel
enjoyed
the
ride
and
was
almost
sorry
when
they
reached
the
great
iron
gates
of
the
hall
wo
you
come
in
and
see
lilias
and
dulcie
she
asked
as
everard
helped
her
to
dismount
at
the
door
i
have
time
i
must
get
home
in
a
hurry
i
an
appointment
with
bowden
and
he
be
waiting
for
me
and
i
kept
you
from
it
oh
i
so
sorry
everard
i
not
look
here
if
you
ever
in
any
trouble
again
anywhere
you
come
to
me
and
i
take
care
of
you
do
forget
that
will
you
i
remember
said
carmel
waving
her
hand
to
him
as
she
watched
him
ride
away
down
the
drive
then
she
turned
into
the
house
to
set
at
rest
the
panic
of
anxiety
which
had
arisen
over
her
with
the
other
members
of
the
shopping
party
chapter
xv
on
the
high
seas
there
was
quite
a
merry
gathering
at
cheverley
chase
that
christmas
all
the
ingleton
children
were
at
home
and
with
cousin
clare
and
stacey
they
made
a
jolly
party
of
nine
a
satisfactory
number
large
enough
to
act
charades
play
round
games
and
even
to
dance
in
the
evenings
if
they
felt
inclined
without
exception
everybody
voted
stacey
an
absolute
sport
he
seemed
to
know
a
little
about
everything
and
could
help
bevis
to
arrange
his
stamp
collection
or
clifford
his
moths
and
butterflies
he
could
name
roland
fossils
give
dulcie
tips
for
the
development
of
her
photos
and
teach
lilias
to
use
the
typewriter
he
was
so
cheery
and
over
it
too
and
so
amusing
and
full
of
fun
and
jokes
that
the
young
ingletons
buzzed
round
him
like
flies
round
a
there
are
some
people
in
the
world
whose
mental
atmosphere
appears
to
act
like
genial
sunshine
because
their
uplifting
personality
demands
the
best
in
others
natures
the
best
is
offered
to
them
stacey
lovable
joyous
enthusiastic
temperament
made
a
wonderful
difference
at
cheverley
chase
the
constant
squabbles
and
rivalries
that
had
been
wont
to
crop
up
seemed
to
melt
away
in
his
presence
never
had
there
been
such
harmonious
holidays
or
such
pleasant
ones
it
was
his
idea
to
take
advantage
of
a
brief
frost
and
flood
the
lawn
so
that
the
family
could
enjoy
skating
there
though
the
ponds
in
the
neighborhood
were
still
unsafe
it
was
carmel
first
experience
of
ice
and
she
struggled
along
held
up
by
her
cousins
feeling
very
helpless
at
first
but
gradually
learning
to
make
her
strokes
and
enjoying
herself
immensely
then
there
was
scouting
in
the
woods
and
there
were
various
expeditions
to
hunt
for
fossils
in
road
heaps
and
quarries
or
to
explore
hitherto
unvisited
parts
of
the
district
there
was
no
doubt
that
stacey
had
a
born
knack
with
young
folks
and
as
a
leader
of
christmas
fun
he
was
quite
unrivaled
among
the
changes
for
the
better
at
cheverley
chase
there
was
perhaps
none
so
great
as
the
marked
difference
in
everard
nobody
could
fail
to
notice
it
bowden
considered
that
the
six
months
spent
as
a
chauffeur
had
knocked
the
nonsense
out
of
the
lad
and
done
him
a
world
of
good
cousin
clare
said
he
had
grown
up
and
the
younger
boys
while
not
exactly
analyzing
the
altered
attitude
admitted
that
their
eldest
brother
was
a
good
sort
these
holidays
everard
always
so
loved
to
be
dog
before
dulcie
confided
to
lilias
i
used
to
hate
the
way
he
bossed
us
all
and
arranged
everything
he
far
nicer
now
he
does
pose
as
young
squire
even
when
he
used
to
tell
us
what
he
do
for
us
when
he
owned
the
estate
it
was
in
such
a
grand
patronizing
manner
that
it
made
me
feel
all
bristles
i
did
want
to
be
helped
like
that
he
is
indeed
very
different
agreed
lilias
thoughtfully
the
only
person
who
did
not
notice
any
change
in
everard
was
carmel
but
she
had
never
known
him
in
the
old
days
so
fixed
him
at
the
standard
at
which
she
had
found
him
the
two
were
excellent
friends
under
her
cousin
teaching
carmel
learnt
much
of
english
country
life
she
had
the
makings
of
a
plucky
little
horsewoman
and
could
soon
take
a
fence
and
ride
to
hounds
she
was
very
much
interested
in
the
reports
in
various
experiments
in
forestry
that
were
being
tried
and
in
motor
plows
and
other
agricultural
implements
that
she
saw
in
use
on
the
farms
it
all
different
from
sicily
she
said
one
day
yes
you
see
i
training
you
to
play
your
part
as
an
english
landowner
replied
everard
you
ought
to
know
something
about
your
estate
carmel
shook
her
head
emphatically
do
call
it
estate
please
i
told
you
again
and
again
that
i
do
mean
to
take
it
from
you
how
could
a
girl
like
i
am
manage
it
properly
you
know
all
about
it
and
i
do
people
ca
be
made
to
take
things
they
do
want
as
soon
as
i
i
shall
hand
it
straight
over
to
you
i
like
to
see
you
master
of
the
chase
it
was
everard
turn
to
shake
his
head
that
can
never
be
carmel
please
let
us
consider
that
matter
perfectly
settled
and
do
let
us
open
the
question
again
it
an
utter
impossibility
for
me
ever
to
be
master
of
the
chase
that
final
i
may
have
my
faults
but
i
not
a
sneak
or
a
you
not
cross
with
me
everard
carmel
was
looking
at
him
anxiously
no
dear
but
you
such
a
child
you
ca
understand
things
properly
yet
you
will
when
you
older
then
what
are
you
going
to
do
everard
after
you
leave
college
study
for
the
bar
i
hope
it
the
kind
of
career
that
would
suit
me
i
think
carmel
dark
eyes
shone
then
i
shall
come
to
court
and
hear
you
plead
a
case
and
when
you
get
into
parliament
oh
yes
you
going
to
get
into
parliament
i
you
are
i
shall
sit
in
the
ladies
gallery
and
listen
to
your
first
speech
if
you
wo
be
squire
of
cheverley
you
must
become
famous
in
some
other
way
in
sicily
we
think
a
tremendous
amount
about
being
the
head
of
the
family
you
be
the
head
of
the
ingletons
and
you
got
to
make
a
name
for
the
sake
of
the
others
i
know
i
ought
to
take
my
father
place
to
the
younger
ones
answered
everard
gravely
i
do
what
i
can
in
that
line
though
i
not
much
to
boast
of
myself
i
afraid
i
not
the
good
sort
you
think
me
carmel
but
there
you
little
witch
you
cast
your
glamour
over
me
somehow
i
suppose
i
got
to
try
to
be
all
you
want
me
princess
carmel
gives
her
orders
here
it
seems
yes
and
in
things
like
this
she
expects
to
be
obeyed
laughed
carmel
i
told
you
once
before
that
you
had
got
the
same
shape
of
forehead
as
the
emperor
augustus
for
nothing
it
was
after
the
girls
had
returned
to
school
during
some
bitter
weather
at
the
end
of
january
that
lilias
caught
a
severe
cold
and
was
kept
in
bed
martin
sent
for
from
glazebrook
took
a
serious
view
of
the
case
and
asked
to
consult
with
hill
of
balderton
the
family
physician
at
cheverley
chase
they
sounded
the
patient
chest
examined
the
temperature
charts
kept
by
miss
walters
and
decided
that
the
climate
of
chilcombe
was
too
damp
for
her
at
present
and
that
she
would
benefit
by
spending
the
trying
spring
months
in
a
warmer
and
drier
atmosphere
the
result
of
this
ultimatum
was
a
large
amount
of
writing
and
telegraphing
between
england
and
sicily
several
confabulations
among
bowden
cousin
clare
stacey
and
miss
walters
and
then
the
remarkable
and
delightful
announcement
that
the
invalid
escorted
by
a
detachment
of
her
family
was
to
be
taken
to
casa
bianca
at
montalesso
on
a
visit
to
and
greville
it
was
of
course
carmel
who
had
engineered
the
whole
business
it
nearly
a
year
since
i
left
home
she
explained
so
it
time
they
let
me
go
and
see
them
i
could
take
lilias
without
dulcie
it
would
be
kind
and
even
miss
walters
saw
that
though
she
held
out
at
first
then
everard
has
been
working
very
hard
and
needs
a
change
but
if
stacey
goes
with
us
they
can
use
daddy
for
a
study
and
read
for
three
or
four
hours
every
morning
and
cousin
clare
must
come
too
to
take
care
of
us
all
we
could
leave
her
behind
mother
loved
her
when
she
came
over
to
fetch
me
last
year
i
do
believe
she
have
let
anybody
else
take
me
away
oh
how
i
want
to
show
sicily
to
you
all
wo
we
have
absolutely
the
time
of
our
lives
to
think
of
going
home
and
taking
you
with
me
it
was
wonderful
how
princess
carmel
seemed
to
manage
to
get
her
own
way
bowden
and
miss
walters
who
were
the
natural
obstacles
to
the
plan
yielded
quite
amicably
after
only
a
short
opposition
cousin
clare
had
encouraged
the
scheme
from
the
first
and
stacey
and
everard
were
all
enthusiasm
you
need
us
men
to
look
after
the
luggage
declared
everard
oblivious
of
the
fact
that
cousin
clare
had
successfully
piloted
carmel
and
her
boxes
across
the
continent
without
any
masculine
assistance
and
was
quite
capable
of
traveling
round
the
world
on
her
own
account
as
greville
was
one
of
the
directors
of
a
line
of
mediterranean
steamers
running
from
liverpool
to
alexandria
it
was
decided
that
the
party
should
book
passages
in
the
and
go
by
sea
as
far
as
malta
crossing
from
there
in
a
local
vessel
to
sicily
the
doctors
thought
that
a
sea
voyage
would
be
better
for
lilias
than
a
long
tiring
train
journey
across
france
and
italy
and
as
it
was
a
novel
experience
the
idea
was
attractive
to
most
of
the
party
fortunately
they
were
able
to
engage
the
accommodation
they
needed
and
set
out
without
further
loss
of
time
i
will
not
describe
the
journey
to
liverpool
or
the
wearisome
drive
through
drab
streets
and
along
miles
of
docks
till
they
reached
the
she
was
a
steamer
of
about
tons
and
considering
the
crowded
condition
of
all
sea
traffic
at
the
time
they
might
think
themselves
very
lucky
to
be
able
to
secure
cabins
without
waiting
months
for
the
privilege
it
was
indeed
only
owing
to
greville
influence
that
they
had
been
able
to
do
so
with
much
curiosity
they
looked
round
the
floating
castle
which
was
to
be
their
home
for
perhaps
a
fortnight
all
seemed
new
and
strange
to
their
wondering
eyes
the
with
its
long
table
and
fixed
crimson
chairs
that
swivelled
round
like
to
allow
their
owners
to
sit
down
on
them
the
small
saloon
with
mirrors
piano
and
books
specially
reserved
for
the
ladies
instead
of
a
the
for
the
gentlemen
and
the
steward
pantry
the
cramped
sleeping
accommodation
rather
appalled
the
girls
though
cousin
clare
who
was
a
seasoned
traveler
assured
them
it
was
far
more
roomy
than
that
given
on
many
other
vessels
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
captain
had
turned
out
of
his
own
cabin
for
them
and
was
sleeping
next
to
the
on
the
bridge
so
that
at
any
rate
they
had
the
best
accommodation
which
the
afforded
four
berths
in
a
space
about
nine
feet
square
certainly
does
not
allow
much
elbow
room
the
girls
planned
to
go
to
bed
in
relays
and
wondered
how
they
could
possibly
have
managed
in
the
still
smaller
quarters
at
which
cousin
clare
had
hinted
neatness
and
order
seemed
an
absolute
essential
there
was
no
place
except
their
berths
on
which
to
lay
anything
down
and
their
possessions
had
to
remain
inside
their
cabin
trunks
each
had
brought
a
linen
case
with
pockets
and
tacked
it
on
to
the
wall
beside
her
berth
to
hold
hairbrush
comb
handkerchiefs
and
a
few
other
immediate
necessities
but
when
anything
else
was
wanted
the
trunks
must
be
pulled
from
under
the
bunks
and
their
contents
turned
over
they
had
hardly
arranged
their
luggage
in
their
cabin
when
everard
came
in
to
tell
them
that
the
vessel
was
getting
under
way
and
they
all
rushed
on
deck
to
witness
the
start
out
from
the
dock
they
steamed
into
the
wide
estuary
of
the
mersey
where
ships
of
many
nations
might
be
seen
and
the
pale
february
sunshine
was
gleaming
upon
the
gray
tidal
waters
that
lay
in
front
and
on
the
roofs
and
chimneys
of
the
great
city
they
were
leaving
behind
i
can
understand
emigrants
feeling
it
a
wrench
to
say
to
england
said
dulcie
leaning
on
the
rail
and
fluttering
her
handkerchief
as
a
parting
tribute
to
her
country
i
be
sorry
if
i
were
never
coming
back
any
more
home
home
yes
and
sicily
is
mine
said
carmel
with
shining
eyes
i
forget
that
every
day
is
taking
me
nearer
to
mother
only
a
fortnight
more
and
we
shall
be
at
casa
bianca
how
i
hope
we
shall
have
a
smooth
voyage
and
perhaps
we
shall
get
there
even
sooner
now
we
have
once
started
off
i
feel
as
if
i
ca
wait
i
did
know
till
that
i
was
so
homesick
the
first
hours
on
board
the
passed
very
successfully
the
ingletons
dined
spent
an
evening
in
the
saloon
made
the
acquaintance
of
other
passengers
and
next
morning
amused
themselves
with
deck
games
they
began
to
congratulate
the
captain
on
the
calmness
of
the
passage
but
he
laughed
and
told
them
not
to
count
up
their
blessings
too
soon
in
february
we
may
expect
anything
in
the
way
of
weather
he
remarked
and
he
was
right
directly
they
entered
the
bay
of
biscay
they
encountered
a
storm
at
first
the
girls
thought
it
rather
fun
to
feel
the
vessel
heaving
its
way
through
the
water
to
have
to
hold
on
to
the
chairs
as
they
crossed
the
saloon
and
to
be
nearly
jerked
off
the
stairs
when
they
went
on
deck
but
as
evening
came
on
one
by
one
they
began
to
feel
the
effects
of
de
and
long
before
the
sounded
had
retired
thankfully
to
their
berths
the
time
that
followed
was
an
absolute
nightmare
the
heavy
seas
dashed
the
about
like
a
she
pitched
and
tossed
and
rolled
so
that
one
moment
the
girls
lying
on
their
backs
would
find
their
heels
higher
than
their
heads
and
the
next
instant
the
position
would
be
reversed
the
violence
of
the
rolling
almost
flung
them
out
on
to
the
floor
and
they
were
obliged
to
cling
to
the
wooden
edges
of
their
berths
all
their
possessions
were
rolling
about
the
cabin
the
linen
tidies
had
tumbled
down
and
hairbrushes
shoes
sponges
clothing
and
trunks
spun
round
and
round
in
confusion
the
noise
was
terrific
the
wind
blew
a
hurricane
and
great
waves
broke
over
the
deck
with
tremendous
force
to
add
to
the
danger
the
cargo
in
the
hold
shifted
and
an
enormous
which
with
some
other
machinery
was
being
taken
to
alexandria
broke
loose
from
the
chains
that
held
it
and
dashed
about
smashing
all
with
which
it
came
in
contact
even
when
morning
dawned
the
storm
did
not
abate
the
girls
heard
afterwards
that
the
men
on
the
were
obliged
to
be
lashed
to
the
rail
with
ropes
that
the
captain
never
left
the
bridge
for
hours
and
that
the
hatches
had
been
battened
down
to
prevent
any
passengers
from
venturing
on
deck
at
the
time
they
were
far
too
ill
to
care
about
any
such
details
lilias
and
dulcie
would
thankfully
have
gone
to
the
bottom
and
though
carmel
and
cousin
clare
were
more
cheerful
the
physical
discomfort
troubled
them
decidedly
more
than
the
danger
the
stewardess
who
poor
woman
was
herself
ill
managed
to
struggle
into
their
cabin
and
holding
on
tightly
to
the
berths
would
pass
them
drinks
of
tea
in
cups
that
could
only
be
filled
a
quarter
full
for
fear
of
spilling
all
through
that
horrible
day
they
lay
still
for
the
violence
of
the
storm
made
it
quite
impossible
to
get
up
and
dress
towards
evening
carmel
who
began
to
feel
better
turned
to
thoughts
of
food
and
after
nibbling
a
biscuit
begged
for
something
more
now
when
the
was
pitching
and
tossing
and
generally
misbehaving
herself
it
was
manifestly
impossible
to
sit
up
and
wield
a
knife
and
fork
for
the
whole
contents
of
the
plate
would
be
whirled
away
at
the
next
sudden
lurch
the
stewardess
did
her
best
however
by
bringing
potatoes
baked
in
their
skins
and
pears
at
both
of
which
delicacies
it
was
possible
to
nibble
while
still
lying
flat
and
holding
with
one
hand
to
the
side
of
the
berth
the
humor
of
the
situation
appealed
to
carmel
so
much
that
she
burst
out
laughing
and
then
cousin
clare
and
even
lilias
and
dulcie
laughed
and
were
persuaded
each
to
try
a
potato
too
they
snatched
intervals
of
sleep
during
the
night
and
woke
much
refreshed
morning
found
the
off
the
coast
of
portugal
and
in
comparatively
calm
waters
feeling
very
shaky
the
ingletons
managed
to
dress
and
tottered
on
deck
everard
and
stacey
both
looking
pale
though
they
assured
every
one
that
they
were
all
right
found
comfortable
chairs
for
the
ladies
and
tucked
them
up
snugly
with
rugs
after
the
long
hours
in
the
stuffy
cabin
it
was
delightful
to
sit
in
the
sunshine
and
watch
the
gray
racing
water
here
and
there
in
the
distance
could
occasionally
be
seen
the
funnels
of
steamers
and
then
there
was
much
excitement
and
focussing
of
and
telescopes
they
wondered
if
other
vessels
had
been
caught
in
the
same
storm
and
how
they
had
fared
and
dulcie
even
hoped
they
might
encounter
a
wreck
and
have
the
privilege
of
rescuing
passengers
from
open
boats
she
was
quite
disappointed
when
nothing
so
romantic
happened
it
was
interesting
to
go
down
to
lunch
in
the
saloon
and
find
the
fiddles
still
on
the
table
long
racks
with
holes
in
which
the
dishes
and
plates
exactly
fit
so
that
they
can
not
be
shaken
about
there
was
naturally
much
conversation
among
the
passengers
in
relation
to
the
storm
and
it
was
passed
round
the
table
as
a
joke
that
the
captain
himself
had
been
seasick
though
he
would
not
for
a
moment
admit
that
he
was
capable
of
such
a
landlubber
weakness
if
i
had
known
what
it
was
going
to
be
like
i
would
never
have
come
by
sea
declared
lilias
whose
symptoms
had
been
more
acute
than
those
of
any
one
else
in
the
party

till

you
have
fallen
in

the
casa
bianca
on
the
following
morning
the
passengers
of
the
woke
to
find
themselves
steaming
into
the
port
of
tangiers
they
scrambled
through
their
toilets
and
hurried
on
deck
in
raptures
over
the
view
of
the
old
moorish
town
against
a
background
of
green
trees
and
the
blue
waters
of
the
bay
in
front
as
some
cargo
was
to
be
shipped
there
would
be
time
to
go
on
shore
and
a
party
was
made
up
under
the
escort
of
captain
porter
and
of
the
greek
agent
who
had
arrived
on
board
with
the
pilot
donkeys
were
hired
for
the
ladies
and
a
cavalcade
set
forth
to
view
the
kasbah
or
native
market
and
some
beautiful
gardens
outside
the
city
walls
it
was
strange
to
the
girls
to
be
in
morocco
with
black
faces
all
round
them
and
to
catch
glimpses
through
open
doorways
of
moorish
courtyards
of
marble
fountains
or
of
little
arab
children
chanting
the
koran
they
were
glad
indeed
of
a
masculine
escort
for
their
looked
such
a
wild
crew
that
would
have
been
frightened
to
be
left
alone
with
them
and
the
eastern
aspect
and
general
dirt
of
the
place
though
picturesque
made
them
thankful
when
they
were
safely
back
again
on
board
ship
to
their
intense
interest
part
of
the
cargo
consisted
of
mohammedan
pilgrims
for
mecca
the
rank
and
file
of
these
encamped
on
the
lower
deck
where
they
sat
ate
slept
and
cooked
their
food
over
charcoal
braziers
filling
up
their
time
by
reciting
the
koran
in
a
monotonous
chant
a
wealthy
merchant
from
morocco
was
also
traveling
to
alexandria
with
his
wife
and
family
and
had
engaged
all
the
quarters
of
the
for
his
exclusive
occupation
his
lady
was
brought
on
board
closely
veiled
and
made
no
further
appearance
but
dulcie
and
carmel
standing
one
day
on
the
upper
deck
could
see
down
to
the
deck
and
noticed
three
small
children
run
out
to
play
the
boys
were
each
clothed
in
a
white
garment
with
a
gaily
colored
striped
sash
but
the
beautiful
little
girl
wore
a
dress
of
palest
blue
velvet
exquisitely
embroidered
with
roses
carmel
who
adored
children
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
call
to
them
and
throw
them
each
an
orange
whereupon
some
warning
voice
summoned
them
inside
the
cabin
and
after
that
though
the
boys
occasionally
played
on
the
deck
the
girl
was
never
again
allowed
to
expose
her
face
to
the
gaze
of
strangers
another
brief
halt
was
made
at
algiers
a
less
barbaric
place
than
tangiers
and
quite
up
to
date
and
modern
in
its
handsome
french
quarter
though
picturesque
in
the
arab
part
of
the
city
it
was
possible
to
get
carriages
here
instead
of
donkeys
and
the
passengers
went
on
shore
for
a
delightful
drive
to
the
caliph
mustapha
palace
through
woods
of
eucalyptus
and
pine
and
palm
and
gardens
of
flowering
shrubs
they
would
have
been
glad
to
stay
longer
in
such
a
beautiful
spot
but
the
was
getting
up
steam
and
unless
they
wished
to
be
left
behind
they
must
go
on
board
again
the
ingleton
party
agreed
afterwards
that
their
voyage
down
the
mediterranean
was
an
experience
never
to
be
forgotten
in
the
bright
february
sunshine
the
blue
waters
deserved
their
reputation
it
was
warm
as
summer
and
all
day
the
passengers
lived
on
deck
watching
the
smooth
sea
and
distant
coastline
or
amusing
themselves
with
games
stacey
with
his
jolly
hearty
ways
and
talent
for
entertaining
was
of
course
the
life
and
soul
of
everything
he
organized
various
sports
during
the
day
and
concerts
and
theatricals
during
the
evening
he
was
great
at
deck
cricket
which
owing
to
the
limitations
of
the
vessel
is
a
very
different
game
from
that
on
land
the
balls
are
made
of
odds
and
ends
of
rope
twisted
together
by
the
sailors
and
must
be
hit
with
caution
so
as
not
to
be
sent
overboard
any
luckless
cricketer
whose
ball
goes
flying
into
the
deep
is
immediately
required
by
the
rules
of
etiquette
to
buy
another
from
the
sailors
who
make
them
so
an
unaccustomed
batsman
may
be
landed
in
much
expense
everybody
found
it
great
fun
however
and
when
they
had
lost
the
day
supply
of
balls
would
take
to
ring
quoits
and
deck
billiards
instead
but
perhaps
the
most
popular
game
of
all
was
for
this
the
passengers
were
divided
into
two
teams
each
team
stood
in
couples
facing
each
other
at
a
distance
of
about
a
yard
at
the
top
and
bottom
of
each
column
was
placed
a
chair
and
on
the
top
chair
were
piled
twelve
small
canvas
bags
filled
with
beans
the
teams
waited
at
attention
till
the
umpire
blew
a
whistle
at
which
signal
they
started
simultaneously
the
player
nearest
the
chair
on
the
side
seized
a
and
flung
it
to
his
opposite
neighbor
who
in
his
turn
flung
it
to
no
on
the
side
who
threw
it
back
to
no
on
the
left
and
so
on
down
the
line
meantime
player
no
had
caught
up
a
second
and
a
third
and
continued
passing
on
others
till
all
the
twelve
were
in
process
of
motion
they
were
tossed
backwards
and
forwards
till
they
reached
the
chair
at
the
bottom
of
the
line
and
were
then
returned
in
the
same
way
that
they
had
come
whichever
team
succeeded
first
in
getting
all
its
back
to
its
starting
chair
was
considered
to
have
won
the
game
it
was
really
a
much
more
difficult
business
than
it
sounds
for
some
of
the
passengers
were
and
would
fail
to
catch
the
bags
and
much
valuable
time
was
wasted
in
picking
them
up
while
others
were
apt
to
cheat
and
in
order
to
get
on
quicker
would
throw
to
no
instead
of
to
no
an
error
which
the
umpire
sharp
eyes
would
immediately
detect
and
he
would
cause
the
bag
to
go
back
to
the
among
all
these
amusements
the
time
on
the
mediterranean
passed
rapidly
and
pleasantly
lilias
was
already
wonderfully
better
the
mild
sea
breezes
had
almost
banished
her
cough
and
her
appetite
was
a
source
of
satisfaction

laughing
prophecy
that
lilias
would
be
so
much
in
love
with
voyaging
that
she
would
want
to
go
on
to
alexandria
was
partly
justified
for
she
was
genuinely
sorry
to
leave
the
vessel
when
they
arrived
at
valetta
the
port
of
malta
i
shall
come
on

some
day
she
assured
him
only
i
bargain
that
you
take
me
all
the
way
up
the
nile
to
look
at
the
pyramids
and
the
ruined
temples
very
well
if
you
undertake
to
dig
out
the
nile

so
as
to
accommodate
a
vessel
of
six
thousands
tons
laughed
the
captain
otherwise
i
shall
have

oh
that

please
book
me
a

i
go
the
arrived
at
malta
in
the
morning
and
as
the
local
steamer
did
not
start
for
syracuse
until
midnight
the
ingleton
party
had
the
whole
day
at
valetta
on
their
hands
they
very
sensibly
established
themselves
at
an
hotel
ordered
lunch
and
dinner
there
then
went
out
into
the
town
to
take
a
walk
along
the
ramparts
and
see
what
sights
they
could
valetta
with
its
streets
of
steps
its
wonderfully
fortified
harbors
its
gay
public
gardens
its
cathedral
and
its
armory
of
the
knights
of
john
where
are
preserved
hundreds
of
priceless
suits
of
armor
belonging
to
the
crusaders
the
famous
silver
bells
that
rang
peals
from
the
churches
and
the
rare
and
beautiful
pieces
of
maltese
lace
exhibited
in
the
shop
windows
had
many
attractions
for
strangers
particularly
those
of
british
nationality
in
the
midst
of
such
foreign
surroundings
it
was
delightful
to
hear
english
spoken
in
the
streets
to
see
the
familiar
figure
of
a
policeman
and
to
know
that
the
great
warships
in
the
harbor
were
part
of
the
british
fleet
and
were
ready
at
any
time
to
protect
our
merchant
vessels
after
a
bewildering
day
the
girls
sat
in
the
lounge
of
the
hotel
after
dinner
trying
to
rest
they
were
very
tired
and
would
gladly
have
gone
to
bed
but
the
syracuse
ran
only
once
in
every
hours
and
started
at
midnight
so
their
traveling
must
perforce
be
continued
without
the
longed
for
break
cousin
clare
cheered
them
up
with
the
thoughts
of
the
coffee
ordered
for
ten
and
of
berths
when
they
got
on
board
the
steamer
we
might
be
far
worse
off
she
assured
them
for
at
least
we
have
a
comfortable
hotel
to
rest
in
i
remember
once
having
to
spend
most
of
the
night
in
a
at
the
station
at
marseilles
put
your
feet
up
on
the
sofa
lilias
carmel
child
if
you
shut
your
eyes
i
believe
you
go
to
sleep
i
vote
we
all
try
to
doze
for
an
hour
until
our
coffee
comes
to
wake
us
up
it
was
quite
a
quaint
experience
to
leave
the
hotel
at
eleven
and
drive
in
carriages
to
the
quay
then
to
get
into
small
boats
and
be
rowed
out
to
the
it
was
a
glorious
night
with
a
moon
and
bright
stars
the
sky
and
the
water
looked
a
deep
dark
blue
and
from
vessels
here
and
there
lights
shone
out
that
sent
twisting
flickering
reflections
into
the
harbor
their
steamer
was
some
distance
away
so
it
was
a
long
row
out
from
the
customs
house
across
the
shimmering
water
the
landlord
of
the
hotel
signor
giordano
who
understood
the
dubious
ways
of
native
boatmen
went
with
them
to
prevent
extortionate
demands
and
saw
them
safely
on
board
the
blackguards
would
have
charged
us
treble
if
we
been
alone
declared
stacey
they
are
a
set
of
brigands
the
whole
lot
of
them
by
daylight
we
might
have
managed
but
it
difficult
in
the
dark
thankful
to
see
all
our
luggage
here
i
thought
a
or
two
were
going
to
be
lost
if
the
girls
had
counted
upon
a
peaceful
night
they
were
much
disappointed
they
retired
indeed
to
their
berths
but
not
to
sleep
the
short
crossing
between
malta
and
sicily
is
one
of
the
worst
in
the
world
and
there
was
a
swell
which
almost
rivalled
their
experiences
in
the
bay
of
biscay
the
little
vessel
pitched
and
tossed
and
rolled
and
caused
them
many
hours
of
discomfort
till
at
length
at
six
it
steamed
into
the
harbor
at
syracuse
and
landed
them
on
sicilian
soil
a
train
journey
of
a
few
hours
followed
to
targia
vecchia
which
was
the
nearest
railway
station
to
montalesso
where
carmel
home
was
situated
greville
met
them
at
targia
vecchia
and
after
kissing
carmel
who
rushed
straight
into
his
arms
gave
a
most
hearty
welcome
to
the
rest
of
the
party
he
had
two
cars
waiting
and
after
the
usual
preliminaries
of
counting
up
luggage
and
giving
up
checks
and
tickets
they
found
themselves
whisking
along
a
good
sicilian
road
in
the
direction
of
etna
whose
white
peak
was
the
commanding
feature
in
the
whole
of
the
surrounding
landscape
the
casa
bianca
or
white
house
justified
its
name
for
it
was
a
handsome
building
of
white
stone
encircled
by
a
veranda
and
hung
with
beautiful
flowering
creepers
in
its
rich
garden
grew
palms
aloes
bamboos
and
the
flaming
judas
trees
thickets
of
roses
and
a
wilderness
of
geraniums
the
ingletons
caught
an
impression
of
gay
foreign
blossoms
as
they
motored
up
the
stately
drive
to
the
steps
of
the
house
their
arrival
had
evidently
been
watched
for
on
the
veranda
was
assembled
quite
a
big
company
ready
to
greet
them
first
there
was
carmel
mother
the
signora
greville
as
she
was
generally
called
a
beautiful
lady
with
her
daughter
dark
eyes
and
the
gracious
stately
manners
of
old
sicilian
traditions
then
there
were
the
children
bertram
nina
vincent
and
luigia
the
two
first
fair
like
their
english
father
the
younger
ones
taking
after
the
italian
side
of
the
family
with
them
were
a
number
of
other
relations
who
had
motored
over
to
welcome
carmel
home
her
uncle
richard
greville
and
aunt
gabrielle
with
their
children
douglas
aimée
tito
and
claude
her
mother
brother
signor
bernardo
trapani
with
her
cousins
ernesto
vittore
and
rosalia
and
her
sister
signora
rosso
with
pretty
berta
and
gaspare
and
little
pepino
all
these
nineteen
relations
gave
the
ingletons
a
typical
italian
greeting
they
embraced
carmel
with
the
demonstrative
enthusiasm
characteristic
of
the
country
and
welcomed
the
rest
of
the
party
with
charming
friendliness
everybody
chattered
at
once
making
kind
inquiries
about
the
journey
and
the
travelers
were
taken
indoors
to
change
their
dusty
clothes
before
coming
down
to
the
elaborate
lunch
that
was
spread
ready
in
the
the
almost
patriarchal
hospitality
of
the
casa
bianca
suggested
the
establishment
of
an
arab
chief
or
a
mediæval
baron
rather
than
that
of
an
ordinary
household
of
the
twentieth
century
it
was
the
strangest
combination
of
north
and
south
that
could
be
imagined
the
grevilles
and
their
relatives
spoke
english
and
italian
equally
well
and
conversed
sometimes
in
one
language
and
sometimes
in
the
other
they
had
been
settled
for
many
years
at
montalesso
and
had
indeed
established
quite
a
colony
of
their
own
there
frank
greville
and
his
brother
richard
together
with
signor
trapani
and
signor
rosso
were
partners
in
a
great
business
thousands
of
cases
of
beautiful
oranges
lemons
grapes
and
almonds
were
packed
at
their
warehouses
and
sent
away
to
england
and
america
they
had
orange
and
lemon
groves
and
vineyards
inland
and
employed
a
small
army
of
people
tending
the
trees
gathering
the
fruit
wrapping
it
and
dispatching
it
by
sea
at
the
port
of
targia
vecchia
being
connected
by
marriage
as
well
as
business
they
formed
a
pleasant
family
circle
and
were
constantly
meeting
at
each
other
houses
their
children
grew
up
in
the
happy
italian
fashion
of
counting
cousins
almost
as
close
as
brothers
and
sisters
it
took
the
ingletons
a
little
while
to
get
accustomed
to
the
life
at
casa
bianca
but
carmel
sitting
in
the
veranda
explained
many
things
to
them
you
must
think
our
particular
ways
are
the
ways
of
the
country
we
an
absolute
mixture
of
english
and
italian
aunt
gabrielle
is
french
and
aunt
giulia
a
real
sicilian
what
is
the
difference
between
a
sicilian
and
an
italian
asked
dulcie
the
difference
between
welsh
and
english
sicily
is
of
course
a
part
of
italy
and
under
the
same
government
just
as
wales
is
part
of
great
britain
but
its
people
are
of
separate
origin
from
the
italians
and
speak
a
dialect
of
their
own
italian
is
the
polite
language
of
sicily
which
is
spoken
in
law
courts
and
shops
and
among
educated
people
but
most
of
the
peasants
speak
sicilian
amongst
themselves
can
you
speak
it
a
little
all
the
words
ending
in
are
turned
into
for
instance
milk
becomes
and
fish
o
changes
into
u
and
ll
into
dd
cold
becomes
and
a
hen
how
fearfully
confusing
i
should
never
learn
it
the
few
sentences
of
italian
i
managed
to
pick
up
are
quite
bad
enough
why
i
think
you
getting
on
very
well
sareda
understood
you
perfectly
this
morning
when
you
asked
for
hot
milk
instead
of
coffee
the
best
of
casa
bianca
was
that
with
its
ample
space
and
its
traditions
of
hospitality
it
seemed
to
absorb
the
ingletons
and
make
them
feel
more
members
of
the
family
than
guests
stacey
and
everard
were
apportioned
a
small
for
a
study
and
worked
hard
every
morning
giving
the
afternoon
to
recreation
lilias
who
had
completely
lost
her
cough
and
looked
wonderfully
well
was
put
to
rest
on
the
piazza
in
the
mornings
though
she
protested
that
she
was
no
longer
an
invalid
dulcie
radiantly
happy
and
enjoying
her
holiday
to
the
full
trotted
about
with
carmel
and
made
friends
with
the
children
and
their
french
governess
bertram
nina
vincent
and
baby
luigia
were
dear
little
people
and
were
only
too
anxious
to
show
the
guest
the
glories
of
the
garden
hand
in
hand
with
them
dulcie
inspected
the
marble
fountain
whose
basin
was
full
of
gold
and
silver
fish
the
tank
where
pink
grew
and
the
groves
of
orange
trees
where
the
ripe
fruit
hung
like
the
golden
apples
of
the
hesperides
and
parma
violets
made
clumps
of
pale
purple
sweetness
beneath
remembering
that
it
was
early
in
march
and
that
bitter
winds
were
probably
blowing
over
chilcombe
and
cheverley
dulcie
was
amazed
at
the
warmth
of
the
sicilian
sunshine
and
the
wealth
of
the
flowers
pink
geraniums
trailed
from
every
wall
great
white
arum
lilies
opened
their
stately
sheaths
marigolds
salvias
carnations
and
other
summer
flowers
were
in
bloom
and
little
green
lizards
basked
on
the
stones
whisking
away
in
great
alarm
however
if
they
were
approached
the
general
mental
atmosphere
of
the
place
was
genial
and
restful
greville
was
kindness
itself
to
his
young
guests
and
they
had
all
fallen
in
love
with
carmel
mother
her
charming
manners
and
gaiety
were
very
attractive
and
the
slight
foreign
accent
with
which
she
spoke
english
was
quite
pretty
lilias
who
had
before
felt
almost
angry
with
carmel
for
feeling
homesick
at
cheverley
began
at
last
to
understand
some
of
the
attractions
which
held
her
cousin
heart
to
sicily
i
rather
have
the
chase
of
course
she
said
to
dulcie
but
on
the
whole
montalesso
is
a
very
beautiful
spot
so
beautiful
that
i
should
mind
living
here
all
the
rest
of
my
life
said
dulcie
gazing
through
the
window
out
over
the
orange
groves
to
where
the
white
peak
of
etna
reared
itself
against
the
intense
blue
of
the
sicilian
sky
chapter
xvii
sicilian
cousins
the
relations
who
had
assembled
to
welcome
carmel
back
came
often
to
the
casa
bianca
and
in
quite
a
short
time
they
and
the
ingletons
were
on
terms
of
intimacy
ernesto
trapani
a
handsome
young
fellow
slightly
older
than
everard
was
studying
at
the
university
of
palermo
in
which
city
vittore
was
at
school
and
the
two
brothers
came
home
from
saturday
to
monday
douglas
greville
a
tall
boy
of
seventeen
who
had
been
at
school
in
paris
also
went
to
the
palermo
university
for
certain
classes
in
chemistry
which
would
help
him
afterwards
in
the
conduct
of
his
father
business
the
younger
children
of
the
various
families
aimée
tito
and
claude
greville
rosalia
trapani
and
berta
gaspare
and
pepino
rosso
had
lessons
with
private
governesses
under
whose
charge
they
had
learnt
to
chatter
italian
english
and
french
with
the
utmost
ease
on
the
saturday
after
the
ingletons
arrival
all
these
young
people
came
over
to
casa
bianca
and
it
was
decided
to
take
picnic
baskets
and
go
out
in
a
body
to
show
the
guests
some
of
the
sights
of
the
neighborhood
so
a
very
gay
party
started
off
from
the
veranda
first
they
went
through
long
groves
of
orange
and
lemon
trees
where
peasant
women
with
bright
handkerchiefs
tied
over
their
heads
were
gathering
the
fruit
and
packing
it
carefully
in
hampers
you
must
simply
live
on
oranges
here
said
dulcie
accepting
the
ripe
specimen
offered
her
by
douglas
do
you
know
this
is
the
fifth
i
had
this
morning
on
the
contrary
we
hardly
ever
touch
them
ourselves
answered
douglas
i
suppose
we
have
so
many
that
we
do
care
about
them
here
i
used
to
like
them
though
when
i
was
in
paris
it
would
take
me
a
long
time
to
get
tired
of
them
declared
dulcie
i
did
not
know
before
what
a
really
ripe
orange
tastes
like
absolutely
delicious
why
do
we
get
them
like
this
in
england
they
would
keep
if
they
were
packed
ripe
and
fruit
that
ripens
on
a
tree
is
always
much
sweeter
than
when
it
has
been
stored
yes
i
know
our
english
apples
are
like
that
i
wish
i
could
be
here
in
the
autumn
to
see
your
peaches
and
vines
i
sha
want
to
go
away
from
this
ripping
place
i
never
seen
anything
so
lovely
in
my
life
montalesso
was
indeed
in
all
the
glory
of
its
spring
charm
everywhere
the
almond
trees
were
in
flower
and
the
effect
of
the
masses
of
lovely
lacy
blossom
against
the
brilliant
blue
of
the
sky
was
a
perfect
picture
with
the
cherry
bloom
of
japan
the
almond
blossom
of
sicily
holds
equal
rank
as
one
of
the
most
beautiful
sights
in
the
world
from
the
height
where
the
young
people
were
walking
they
could
see
the
sea
at
targia
vecchia
and
the
little
red
sails
of
fishing
smacks
in
the
harbor
and
the
flat
topped
half
moorish
houses
each
with
its
clump
of
orange
trees
and
its
veranda
of
vines
beyond
a
landmark
for
all
the
district
was
the
great
glittering
peak
of
etna
its
lower
slopes
were
clothed
with
vineyards
and
dotted
here
and
there
with
villages
a
second
range
was
forest
clad
and
its
dazzling
summit
feet
above
lay
in
the
region
of
the
eternal
snows
a
thin
column
of
smoke
issued
from
the
crater
and
stretched
like
a
gray
ribbon
across
the
sky
lilias
viewed
it
with
some
uneasiness
i
hope
there
wo
be
an
eruption
she
said
nervously
the
boys
laughed
english
people
are
always
so
scared
at
poor
old
etna
they
imagine
the
crater
is
going
to
turn
on
fireworks
for
their
entertainment
that
smoke
is
a
safety
valve
so
do
be
afraid
the
observatory
gives
warning
if
anything
serious
is
going
to
take
place
and
what
happens
then
some
of
the
people
on
the
slopes
run
away
in
time
and
some
stay
to
guard
their
property
we
quite
safe
at
montalesso
for
we
fifteen
miles
away
though
the
clear
air
makes
the
peak
look
so
near
they
had
left
the
lemon
groves
and
the
almond
blossom
behind
and
were
now
walking
along
a
grassy
where
flocks
of
goats
were
feeding
the
goatherds
picturesque
little
boys
dressed
in
sheepskin
coats
and
soft
felt
hats
with
brown
eyes
and
thick
brown
curls
were
amusing
themselves
by
playing
on
reed
pipes
they
recalled
the
idylls
of
theocritus
and
might
almost
have
been
products
of
the
fourth
century
instead
of
the
twentieth
century
the
wild
flowers
that
grew
in
this
plain
were
gorgeous
there
were
anemones
of
all
kinds
scarlet
purple
pale
pink
and
white
irises
of
many
colors
blue
pimpernel
yellow
salvia
violet
grape
hyacinths
and
clumps
of
small
white
narcissus
above
all
rose
the
splendid
pale
pink
blossoms
of
the
asphodel
a
striking
feature
of
a
sicilian
landscape
the
ingletons
ran
about
in
greatest
delight
picking
handfuls
of
what
were
to
them
beautiful
garden
flowers
it
a
moot
point
whether
proserpine
was
gathering
narcissus
or
asphodel
when
pluto
ran
away
with
her
declared
stacey
offering
lilias
a
bouquet
which
a
greek
nymph
might
have
been
pleased
to
accept
i
incline
to
asphodel
myself
because
of
its
immortal
significance
it
gives
an
added
meaning
to
the
myth
what
is
the
story
exactly
asked
dulcie
do
tell
it
please
yes
do
begged
all
the
children
crowding
round
stacey
we
want
to
hear
your
english
story
it
not
an
english
one
but
a
very
old
greek
one
shall
we
rest
on
this
wall
while
i
tell
it
luigia
shall
come
on
my
knee
yes
room
for
pepino
too
and
gaspare
and
vincent
may
sit
next
to
me
well
in
the
old
golden
age
when
the
world
was
young
ceres
the
goddess
of
the
harvest
who
gave
all
the
fruits
of
earth
to
men
had
a
beautiful
daughter
named
proserpine
or
as
the
greeks
called
her
persephone
she
made
sicily
her
place
of
residence
and
she
and
her
nymphs
used
to
delight
themselves
with
its
flowery
meadows
and
limpid
streams
and
beautiful
views
one
day
she
and
her
companions
were
wandering
in
the
plain
of
enna
gathering
flowers
when
there
suddenly
appeared
the
god
pluto
king
of
hades
the
regions
of
the
dead
falling
in
love
with
beautiful
proserpine
he
seized
her
and
forced
her
to
get
into
his
chariot
she
screamed
to
her
maidens
but
they
could
not
help
her
and
pluto
carried
her
off
with
his
trident
he
struck
a
hole
in
the
ground
so
that
chariot
and
horses
fell
through
into
hades
of
which
place
proserpine
became
the
queen
now
ceres
did
not
know
what
had
happened
to
her
daughter
and
she
wandered
all
over
the
earth
seeking
for
her
at
last
she
found
proserpine
girdle
on
the
surface
of
the
waters
of
a
fountain
where
pluto
had
struck
his
hole
in
the
ground
and
the
nymph
arethusa
told
her
how
her
daughter
had
been
stolen
away
full
of
indignation
ceres
went
to
complain
to
jupiter
who
promised
that
proserpine
should
be
restored
if
she
had
taken
nothing
to
eat
in
the
realm
of
hades
unfortunately
proserpine
as
she
walked
in
the
elysian
fields
had
gathered
and
eaten
a
pomegranate
which
act
constituted
her
a
subject
of
those
regions
to
pacify
ceres
jupiter
permitted
that
proserpine
should
spend
six
months
of
every
year
with
pluto
in
hades
and
the
other
six
months
with
her
mother
on
earth
each
spring
ceres
went
to
the
entrance
of
a
great
gloomy
grotto
to
meet
her
daughter
and
with
her
return
all
the
flowers
bloomed
on
earth
again
there
is
a
very
celebrated
picture
by
sir
frederick
leighton
called
return
of
persephone
the
artist
has
painted
ceres
at
the
entrance
of
the
grotto
with
the
sunshine
behind
her
holding
out
her
arms
to
the
lovely
daughter
whom
the
god
mercury
is
bringing
back
to
her
out
of
the
darkness
the
story
is
one
of
those
old
nature
myths
of
which
the
greeks
were
so
fond
the
time
proserpine
spent
in
hades
symbolized
winter
when
winds
blew
cold
and
few
flowers
bloomed
and
her
return
symbolized
the
advent
of
spring
it
has
a
deeper
meaning
also
to
those
who
look
for
it
because
it
is
a
type
of
the
resurrection
and
shows
that
our
dear
ones
are
not
really
taken
from
us
but
will
come
again
in
more
glorious
life
and
beauty
many
of
the
old
greek
myths
had
this
meaning
hidden
under
them
as
if
they
were
sent
to
prepare
people
for
the
truth
that
christ
was
to
reveal
more
fully
later
on
nearly
all
early
religions
began
with
pure
and
beautiful
conceptions
of
god
and
then
trailed
down
to
earth
because
their
followers
were
too
ignorant
to
understand
the
ancient
egyptians
believed
in
god
and
said
that
one
of
his
attributes
was
strength
the
strongest
thing
they
knew
was
a
bull
so
they
made
colossal
statues
of
bulls
in
black
marble
to
show
god
strength
but
the
populace
worshipped
the
statues
instead
of
god
himself
and
became
idolaters
in
the
same
way
the
ancient
greeks
realized
that
beauty
was
part
of
god
scheme
of
work
and
they
came
to
worship
beauty
quite
apart
from
goodness
forgetting
that
the
two
must
go
together
they
imagined
their
gods
and
goddesses
as
magnificent
men
and
women
with
superb
bodies
but
no
beauty
of
soul
and
as
there
was
nothing
uplifting
in
this
religion
it
soon
died
out
as
all
things
die
in
time
if
they
do
help
us
to
grow
nearer
to
god
the
story
of
proserpine
is
one
of
the
prettiest
of
the
old
greek
legends
and
i
can
just
imagine
her
gathering
these
lovely
flowers
i
believe
we
going
on
to
see
her
fountain
are
we
vittore
she
made
it
with
her
tears
when
pluto
carried
her
off
the
object
of
the
expedition
was
indeed
to
see
proserpine
fountain
a
clear
spring
out
of
which
flowed
a
small
river
after
walking
another
mile
across
the
meadows
the
party
came
to
this
river
where
they
were
able
to
engage
boats
to
row
them
up
to
the
fount
it
was
a
unique
spot
for
the
whole
of
the
banks
were
bordered
with
an
avenue
of
papyrus
which
grew
there
in
greatest
profusion
legend
said
that
it
had
been
planted
by
an
egyptian
princess
who
brought
it
from
the
nile
and
that
it
grew
in
no
other
place
in
europe
a
statement
which
was
satisfactory
enough
though
rather
difficult
to
verify
there
was
much
bargaining
after
true
sicilian
fashion
with
the
native
boatmen
who
demanded
at
least
four
times
what
they
meant
to
take
protesting
that
they
would
be
ruined
at
the
sum
ernesto
named
to
them
and
finally
when
he
pretended
to
walk
away
accepting
his
offer
with
enthusiasm
this
very
necessary
preliminary
satisfactorily
settled
the
company
was
packed
into
the
small
boats
about
four
going
in
each
in
the
distribution
of
the
guests
occurred
the
first
hitch
in
the
ingletons
visit
stacey
suggested
that
it
was
advisable
to
sandwich
children
and
and
he
and
lilias
started
in
the
first
barca
in
charge
of
little
luigia
vincent
and
pepino
dulcie
and
douglas
were
responsible
for
gaspare
rosalia
and
nina
while
vittore
and
aimée
claude
and
bertram
went
together
carmel
held
tito
and
berta
each
by
a
hand
and
ernesto
helped
them
all
three
into
a
boat
everard
was
in
the
very
act
of
jumping
in
after
them
when
ernesto
stopped
him
excuse
me
signore
that
is
my
place
there
is
plenty
of
room
for
you
in
the
other
boat
and
surely
in
this
too
said
everard
flushing
with
annoyance
ernesto
shrugged
his
shoulders
oh
no
you
and
i
are
too
heavy
to
be
together
vittore
and
the
others
are
light
you
will
just
make
weight
and
stepping
in
ernesto
took
his
seat
beside
carmel
and
told
the
boatman
to
push
off
while
everard
with
a
face
like
a
thundercloud
joined
the
younger
children
up
the
narrow
little
river
the
light
boats
pushed
under
an
overhanging
archway
of
papyrus
reeds
so
that
they
seemed
as
if
penetrating
through
a
green
jungle
the
boatmen
began
to
sing
sicilian
and
vittore
and
rosalia
and
tito
and
some
of
the
others
joined
in
to
everyone
except
everard
the
excursion
was
delightful
but
he
considering
himself
treated
with
scant
politeness
sat
sulking
in
vittore
boat
and
would
scarcely
speak
to
aimée
who
made
a
really
heroic
effort
to
amuse
him
proserpine
fountain
where
after
half
an
hour
rowing
the
boatmen
took
them
was
a
clear
deep
pool
reflecting
the
blue
of
the
sky
and
encircled
with
papyrus
donax
reeds
and
beautiful
irises
it
seemed
a
fit
setting
for
the
legend
of
antiquity
and
a
fertile
imagination
could
almost
conjure
up
a
vision
of
pluto
with
his
chariot
and
black
horses
carrying
off
the
lovely
nymph
from
her
meadows
of
flowers
to
his
gloomy
realm
of
darkness
on
the
way
back
the
second
boat
made
a
halt
to
cut
some
pieces
of
papyrus
reed
and
dulcie
called
out
in
much
excitement
to
the
occupants
of
the
other
barcas
lilias
everard
we
cutting
some
papyrus
and
douglas
is
going
to
show
me
how
to
make
it
into
parchment
like
the
ancient
egyptians
used
to
write
on
wo
it
be
gorgeous
do
you
want
some
too
rather
replied
lilias
appealing
to
stacey
who
promptly
pulled
out
his
penknife
and
began
to
hack
away
at
a
stout
stem
on
her
behalf
the
lengths
of
papyrus
which
they
bore
off
with
them
somewhat
resembled
thick
pieces
of
rhubarb
and
how
these
were
ever
going
to
be
turned
into
writing
materials
was
a
puzzle
to
dulcie
though
douglas
assured
her
airily
that
he
knew
all
about
it
the
elders
of
the
party
were
glad
to
get
the
lively
youngsters
safely
on
dry
land
again
i
thought
rosalia
was
going
to
turn
into
a
water
nymph
said
lilias
comparing
notes
afterwards
with
dulcie
she
leaned
over
in
the
most
dangerous
manner
and
so
did
tito
if
the
boats
had
been
so
broad
they
would
have
capsized
then
pluto
would
have
bagged
the
whole
lot
of
us
more
than
he
quite
bargained
for
perhaps
laughed
dulcie
the
making
of
the
parchment
was
a
matter
of
great
interest
to
the
ingletons
with
douglas
as
an
instructor
they
all
set
to
work
on
its
manufacture
taking
ten
inch
lengths
of
the
papyrus
reeds
they
cut
them
into
long
thin
vertical
slices
and
laid
these
across
each
other
in
the
form
of
a
small
mat
between
sheets
of
blotting
paper
this
was
next
squeezed
through
a
to
rid
it
of
superfluous
moisture
then
placed
under
a
heavy
weight
in
the
manner
of
pressing
flowers
when
at
last
it
was
dry
the
alternate
layers
of
the
papyrus
had
adhered
together
and
amalgamated
into
a
substance
identical
with
the
old
egyptian
parchment
though
much
coarser
and
rougher
in
quality
the
girls
were
delighted
with
it
they
borrowed
a
book
on
egypt
from
greville
library
and
copied
little
pictures
of
the
sphinx
scarabs
ra
the
sun
god
and
other
appropriate
bits
painting
them
in
bold
colors
on
their
pieces
of
parchment
and
feeling
as
if
they
had
gone
back

indeed
became
the
rage
at
casa
bianca
all
the
various
cousins
vied
with
one
another
in
making
the
choicest
specimens
they
wrote
letters
to
each
other
upon
it
rolling
up
the
parchments
and
tying
them
with
ribbons
in
the
manner
of
ancient
scribes
perhaps
the
whitest
and
best
welded
sheet
of
all
was
one
made
by
stacey
who
turned
out
to
be
so
clever
at
the
new
craze
that
he
jokingly
declared
he
must
be
a
priest
of
some
egyptian
temple
come
to
life
again
he
used
a
reed
pen
and
got
some
very
happy
effects
in
hieroglyphs
puzzling
out
the
names
of
each
of
the
company
in
the
curious
picture
writing
of
the
days
of
the
pharaohs
who
reared
the
pyramids
will
you
take
us
some
day
to
see
the
nile

lilias
happy
in
the
possession
of
her
name
neatly
pictured
on
the
specially
white
sheet
of
papyrus
with
a
lotus

the
lily
of
egypt
painted
underneath
you
know
captain
porter
said
we
ought
to
go
to
alexandria
nothing
would
please
me
better
if
the
fates
willed
it
smiled
stacey
we
go
in
a
party
and
hire
a
boat
up
the
nile
and
take
all
the
grevilles
with
us
specially
douglas
declared
dulcie
i
count
them
my
cousins
too
do
you
everard
laughed
everard
cousins
by
all
manner
of
means
let
them
be
though
i
do
bargain
to
include
the
trapani
family
among
our
new
relations
he
added
softly
to
himself
half
under
his
breath
chapter
xviii
a
night
of
adventure
it
will
be
seen
from
the
events
recorded
in
the
last
chapter
that
everard
while
liking
the
various
members
of
the
greville
family
had
taken
a
great
prejudice
against
ernesto
trapani
the
fact
is
that
everard
brought
up
with
all
the
insular
pride
of
birth
of
an
english
squire
had
a
poor
opinion
of
foreigners
and
was
unwise
enough
occasionally
to
reveal
his
attitude
of
british
superiority
and
to
give
himself
airs
ernesto
handsome
clever
and
with
a
long
line
of
italian
ancestry
at
his
back
considered
himself
in
every
way
a
match
for
the
young
englishman
and
would
argue
with
him
on
many
points
often
beating
him
by
logic
though
never
convincing
him
it
annoyed
everard
to
see
ernesto
on
terms
of
great
intimacy
with
carmel
and
to
hear
them
talk
together
in
italian
a
language
of
which
as
yet
he
knew
only
a
few
sentences
i
wish
you
speak
decent
english
instead
of
that
beastly
lingo
he
said
to
her
one
day
petulantly
carmel
flushed
crimson
please
do
call
italian
a
beastly
lingo
i
sorry
if
i
been
rude
in
speaking
it
but
i
sometimes
forget
that
you
do
understand
what
we
saying
it
comes
naturally
to
me
i
try
to
remember
remember
you
an
ingleton
and
the
owner
of
english
property
urged
everard
now
you
at
casa
bianca
i
do
believe
you
ever
give
a
thought
to
the
chase
yes
i
do
oftener
than
you
suppose
i
grown
to
love
england
more
than
i
believed
possible
in
summer
the
country
was
all
green
and
beautiful
while
here
every
blade
of
grass
gets
burnt
up
by
the
blazing
sun
oh
yes
i
really
very
fond
of
the
chase
i
am
indeed
then
which
do
you
like
better
england
or
sicily
but
at
that
question
carmel
shook
her
head
my
opinions
are
my
own
and
i
not
going
to
tell
them
to
anybody
she
flashed
merrily
it
a
good
motto
to
enjoy
yourself
wherever
you
may
happen
to
be
that
all
you
get
out
of
me
everard
and
quite
enough
too
though
everard
might
have
private
reasons
of
his
own
that
marred
the
pleasure
of
his
visit
to
montalesso
his
sisters
were
having
the
time
of
their
lives
lilias
with
the
help
of
stacey
had
taken
enthusiastically
to
botany
and
was
making
a
collection
of
pressed
sicilian
flowers
she
had
also
begun
to
sketch
under
his
tuition
and
had
finished
quite
a
pretty
little
water
color
of
the
house
dulcie
always
interested
in
country
life
was
thoroughly
happy
on
the
estate
she
liked
to
watch
the
gathering
of
the
oranges
and
lemons
the
pruning
of
the
vines
to
see
the
great
white
bullocks
plowing
in
the
fields
or
slowly
drawing
the
gaily
painted
carts
the
wealth
of
flowers
delighted
her
and
much
to
everard
disgust
she
frankly
acknowledged
herself
in
love
with
sicily
and
insisted
that
she
would
like
to
live
there
i
shall
ask
aunt
nita
to
keep
me
instead
of
carmel
she
declared
you
may
all
go
back
to
england
and
leave
me
behind
what
would
bowden
say
to
that
asked
cousin
clare
he
has
arranged
for
you
to
stay
another
two
years
at
school
oh
bother
bowden
i
wish
he
was
my
guardian
ca
i
swop
him
and
have
greville
instead
unfortunately
people
ca
change
their
guardians
laughed
cousin
clare
they
have
to
stick
to
those
to
whom
the
law
assigns
them
cheer
up
you
might
have
a
far
sterner
one
than
bowden
and
a
much
more
disagreeable
school
than
chilcombe
you
the
summer
term
to
look
forward
to
when
you
get
back
chilcombe
is
montalesso
persisted
dulcie
pulling
a
face
no
you
dinky
deary
cousin
clare
you
never
persuade
me
to
like
school
again
i
shall
catch
a
cold
on
purpose
as
soon
as
i
go
back
and
then
you
have
to
bring
me
over
here
for
the
sake
of
a
warmer
climate
bribe
the
old
doctor
who
probably
send
you
to
switzerland
for
treatment
among
the
snow
said
cousin
clare
who
generally
managed
to
get
the
last
word
the
ingletons
had
now
been
some
weeks
at
the
casa
bianca
and
were
beginning
to
grow
more
accustomed
to
sicilian
ways
in
car
they
had
been
taken
to
many
of
the
principal
places
of
interest
in
the
neighborhood
they
had
seen
the
castello
the
old
ruined
tower
which
in
bygone
days
had
been
the
stronghold
of
brigands
the
ancient
greek
amphitheater
with
its
marble
seats
still
bearing
the
names
of
owners
who
sat
and
watched
the
chariot
races
in
the
fourth
century
the
beautiful
temple
of
neptune
and
the
palazzo
salvatore
with
its
museum
of
priceless
treasures
there
was
one
local
gathering
however
which
carmel
declared
they
must
not
on
any
account
miss
i
so
glad
you
will
here
for
the
fair
at
targia
vecchia
she
said
it
really
the
event
of
the
whole
year
you
see
more
sicilian
customs
there
than
anywhere
else
i
know
the
peasants
come
down
from
the
mountains
for
miles
round
you
just
love
it
such
a
spectacle
was
of
course
a
great
attraction
to
the
ingletons
so
a
select
party
was
made
up
to
visit
the
famous
fair
signora
greville
nervous
about
infection
would
not
allow
her
younger
children
to
go
for
fear
they
might
catch
measles
among
the
motley
crowd
and
the
same
cautious
care
was
extended
over
the
children
of
the
other
families
but
douglas
and
aimée
joined
the
expedition
and
ernesto
and
vittore
somewhat
to
everard
disgust
had
a
special
holiday
from
palermo
in
order
to
be
present
they
all
set
off
on
foot
and
followed
the
winding
road
that
led
down
the
from
montalesso
to
the
little
harbor
of
targia
vecchia
for
once
the
seemed
alive
with
people
down
every
mountain
path
descended
donkeys
on
which
were
seated
girls
or
women
in
their
best
gala
garments
striped
skirts
bright
aprons
lace
on
their
velvet
bodices
gay
kerchiefs
on
their
heads
and
large
gold
in
their
ears
the
men
who
led
the
donkeys
were
dressed
in
equally
picturesque
fashion
many
wore
black
velvet
jackets
and
scarlet
neapolitan
caps
or
long
brown
cloaks
with
hoods
over
their
heads
their
legs
bound
with
rough
puttees
and
their
feet
thrust
into
sandals
of
hide
with
the
hair
left
on
everybody
seemed
to
carry
a
large
cotton
umbrella
either
of
bright
green
or
magenta
they
think
it
looks
grand
explained
carmel
every
peasant
brings
his
umbrella
to
the
fair
to
show
that
he
has
one
except
the
brigands
added
vittore
you
can
always
tell
a
brigand
because
he
never
carries
an
umbrella
are
there
any
brigands
asked
dulcie
anxiously
oh
yes
replied
vittore
winking
secretly
at
ernesto
there
are
quite
a
number
still
in
the
neighborhood
i
was
talking
to
one
only
the
other
day
admitted
ernesto
not
really
it
quite
a
profession
still
in
sicily
do
they
catch
people
and
hold
them
to
ransom
dulcie
face
was
a
study
certainly
they
do
and
chop
their
fingers
off
if
their
relations
pay
up
it
quite
an
ordinary
little
trick
of
theirs
is
it
safe
to
go
to
the
fair
do
you
think
that
man
in
front
has
any
umbrella
do
be
a
scared
rabbit
dulcie
you
little
silly
ca
you
see
they
ragging
you
put
in
everard
impatiently
there
are
no
brigands
left
in
sicily
now
are
there
indeed
said
ernesto
ah
that
shows
how
much
you
know
about
it
only
last
week
the
count
rozallo
was
taken
prisoner
on
the
road
to
catania
and
carried
off
into
the
mountains
he
there
yet
till
he
pays
a
ransom
of
lire
pooh
i
expect
he
done
it
to
evade
his
creditors
if
the
story
is
true
i
believe
in
brigands
when
i
meet
them
and
not
before
scoffed
everard
and
i
shall
be
frightened
of
every
man
who
does
carry
a
big
red
or
green
umbrella
declared
dulcie
hanging
on
to
the
arm
which
douglas
gallantly
offered
for
her
protection
what
do
you
think
about
it
carmel
i
think
i
quite
safe
for
the
brigands
are
generally
very
chivalrous
to
women
and
only
run
away
with
gentlemen
and
chop
off
their
fingers
laughed
carmel
by
this
time
they
had
descended
the
road
and
were
entering
the
picturesque
little
town
generally
targia
vecchia
was
the
quietest
of
places
but
it
was
the
fair
was
held
all
along
the
main
street
in
a
large
square
opposite
the
church
and
also
on
the
beach
everywhere
there
were
stalls
selling
every
commodity
that
can
be
imagined
on
the
was
sugared
bread
in
the
shape
of
hearts
or
rings
covered
with
gold
and
silver
tinsel
there
were
sugar
images
fruits
little
baskets
carriages
birds
animals
all
made
in
sugar
and
apparently
much
in
request
among
the
juvenile
population
there
were
cheap
toys
bright
handkerchiefs
venetian
shoes
tambourines
lengths
of
gay
dress
materials
dates
figs
and
oranges
and
the
inevitable
red
and
green
cotton
umbrellas
the
small
shops
following
an
ancient
custom
which
dates
back
so
many
centuries
had
hung
out
signs
to
signify
the
nature
of
their
wares
to
those
peasants
who
could
not
read
over
the
baker
doorway
dangled
a
loaf
the
shoemaker
had
a
large
boot
and
the
wine
shops
still
showed
the
garlands
of
ivy
once
dedicated
to
bacchus
a
chattering
crew
of
people
moved
from
stall
to
stall
laughing
gesticulating
and
bargaining
and
evidently
enjoying
themselves
a
pretty
girl
was
trying
and
looking
at
the
effect
in
a
mirror
held
by
the
vendor
while
older
folks
flocked
round
a
quack
medicine
dealer
who
was
loudly
proclaiming
the
virtues
of
the
various
bottles
the
scene
on
the
shore
was
even
more
picturesque
than
that
in
the
town
the
beach
which
was
covered
with
pebbly
sand
commanded
a
beautiful
view
of
hills
clad
with
prickly
pear
of
the
bright
blue
sea
the
distant
calabrian
coast
and
mountains
tipped
with
snow
gaudily
painted
carts
were
drawn
up
while
their
owners
bought
and
sold
and
rows
of
donkeys
with
smart
trappings
and
were
tied
to
posts
on
the
sand
were
numbers
of
animals
for
sale
oxen
cows
calves
goats
kids
great
black
hogs
covered
with
bristles
like
wild
boars
and
tiny
pigs
which
when
bought
were
popped
into
bags
with
their
heads
and
the
two
front
feet
peeping
out
the
noise
was
indescribable
cattle
lowed
pigs
squealed
and
grunted
men
shouted
children
cried
and
musicians
sang
and
rattled
tambourines
beggars
of
all
descriptions
the
blind
the
halt
and
the
maimed
were
there
clamoring
for
alms
and
calling
attention
to
their
deficiencies
often
thrusting
a
withered
hand
or
the
stump
of
an
arm
under
the
very
noses
of
strangers
to
demand
sympathy
and
money
from
them
lilias
and
dulcie
began
to
understand
why
signora
greville
had
not
allowed
the
younger
children
to
come
to
the
fair
they
were
almost
frightened
by
the
dirt
and
impudence
of
the
beggars
and
each
clung
to
the
arm
of
a
masculine
protector
to
pilot
her
through
the
crowd
they
were
indeed
glad
to
move
away
from
the
rather
rough
element
on
the
beach
and
turn
back
through
the
town
where
the
peasants
were
now
taking
lunch
of
maccaroni
and
omelettes
at
tables
spread
in
the
streets
they
bought
a
few
curiosities
and
souvenirs
at
the
stalls
stopped
to
listen
to
a
band
of
musicians
then
turned
up
the
again
and
made
their
way
back
to
montalesso
leaving
targia
vecchia
to
continue
its
i
should
think
the
fair
must
be
a
wonderful
sight
at
night
said
everard
that
afternoon
at
the
casa
bianca
rather
agreed
ernesto
the
people
will
be
dancing
down
the
streets
by
torch
light
and
singing
at
the
pitch
of
their
voices
i
give
anything
to
see
it
i
should
go
my
boy
if
i
were
you
put
in
greville
quietly
you
find
it
a
rowdy
place
and
not
at
all
to
your
liking
the
wine
shops
will
have
been
very
busy
all
day
and
the
people
are
over
gentle
with
strangers
when
their
up
added
vittore
they
no
use
for
a
nice
young
englishman
down
in
targia
vecchia
best
stay
safe
at
home
vittore
who
had
waited
till
his
uncle
was
out
of
earshot
spoke
tauntingly
everard
colored
crimson
i
not
afraid
of
a
few
sicilian
peasants
he
remarked
vittore
sneer
had
aroused
his
opposition
and
made
him
determined
to
go
more
particularly
as
carmel
had
expressed
great
regret
at
not
having
bought
a
certain
necklace
which
she
had
seen
on
a
stall
and
wished
to
add
to
a
collection
she
was
making
of
sicilian
peasant
jewelry
it
would
be
a
triumph
to
walk
down
alone
to
the
fair
buy
the
necklace
and
show
these
young
foreigners
that
englishmen
knew
how
to
take
care
of
themselves
he
did
not
mention
his
intention
to
stacey
or
to
greville
but
waiting
till
it
was
almost
dark
he
avoided
the
family
dashed
into
the
garden
and
set
off
along
the
road
to
targia
vecchia
as
greville
had
prophesied
he
found
the
little
town
in
a
decidedly
lively
condition
barrels
of
wine
were
being
broached
in
the
streets
by
the
light
of
flaring
torches
and
most
of
the
men
were
in
an
excited
condition
the
cheap
jacks
were
still
doing
a
brisk
trade
and
at
the
jewelry
stall
everard
was
able
to
buy
the
souvenir
he
wanted
for
carmel
it
was
the
last
of
the
sort
left
so
he
considered
himself
in
luck
he
put
the
small
parcel
in
his
pocket
and
turned
away
rather
disgusted
with
the
riot
of
the
town
and
glad
to
leave
the
noise
and
glare
behind
him
he
tramped
up
the
steep
country
road
with
a
sense
of
relief
it
was
a
beautiful
calm
night
and
a
half
moon
hung
silver
in
the
sky
the
stars
far
brighter
than
they
ever
appear
in
england
twinkled
in
the
blue
firmament
behind
the
mighty
peak
of
etna
it
was
not
really
dark
and
it
was
quite
possible
to
see
the
main
outlines
of
most
of
the
features
of
the
landscape
everard
walked
along
cheerily
so
far
he
had
met
with
no
hindrance
the
people
at
the
fair
had
indeed
looked
at
him
with
much
curiosity
and
had
even
spoken
to
him
but
certainly
nobody
had
offered
in
any
way
to
molest
him
the
dangers
of
targia
vecchia
at
nightfall
had
evidently
been
grossly
exaggerated
so
confident
was
everard
that
he
even
whistled
a
tune
as
he
walked
and
planned
how
he
would
stroll
into
the
on
his
return
to
casa
bianca
slip
the
necklace
from
his
pocket
and
casually
mention
where
he
had
been
in
his
preoccupation
he
did
not
give
any
particular
heed
to
the
road
or
see
movement
among
the
dark
shadows
of
a
group
of
prickly
pears
that
overhung
a
sharp
corner
without
the
slightest
warning
a
pistol
shot
suddenly
rang
out
and
three
figures
springing
from
the
shelter
of
the
prickly
pears
flung
themselves
upon
him
for
a
second
he
had
a
vision
of
cloaks
and
masked
faces
and
hit
out
pluckily
but
they
were
three
to
one
and
in
a
few
moments
they
had
secured
him
bound
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
tied
a
bandage
over
his
eyes
almost
stunned
at
first
by
the
suddenness
of
the
attack
everard
as
soon
as
he
recovered
his
speech
protested
indignantly
and
demanded
of
his
assailants
what
they
wanted
they
spoke
together
in
rapid
italian
which
he
did
not
understand
then
one
of
them
replied
in
very
broken
english
signore
it
is
our
order
to
take
you
to
our
captain
and
who
is
your
captain
that
i
not
tell
and
what
does
your
captain
want
with
me
he
ask
ransom
you
rich
inglese
property
in
your
own
country
you
give
many
thousand
lire
ransom
indeed
i
ca
protested
everard
you
made
a
big
mistake
i
own
any
property
and
i
not
rich
at
all
you
better
let
me
go
or
there
be
trouble
in
store
for
you
when
my
friends
hear
of
it
the
brigands
if
such
they
were
made
no
reply
possibly
they
did
not
understand
him
they
were
busy
moreover
searching
his
pockets
and
were
appropriating
his
watch
money
and
other
valuables
with
short
grunts
of
satisfaction
bound
hand
and
foot
everard
could
offer
no
physical
resistance
though
his
bold
spirit
was
raging
at
length
his
captors
having
rifled
all
they
wanted
untied
his
legs
and
taking
him
by
the
arms
hauled
him
along
between
them
blindfold
as
he
was
he
had
no
notion
in
what
direction
he
was
going
though
they
seemed
to
leave
the
main
road
and
to
be
taking
a
journey
over
fields
and
rough
ground
were
they
taking
him
to
the
castello
he
wondered
it
had
been
a
noted
haunt
of
brigands
in
bygone
days
and
its
inaccessible
position
would
make
it
a
safe
he
asked
himself
what
was
going
to
happen
how
soon
would
he
be
missed
at
the
casa
bianca
would
a
search
be
made
for
him
and
with
what
success
these
fellows
were
often
very
crafty
in
their
places
of
concealment
and
had
evidently
got
hold
of
some
false
idea
of
his
rank
and
fortune
in
that
everard
went
through
very
severe
mental
as
well
as
physical
discomfort
his
captors
were
not
too
gentle
and
hurried
him
along
anyhow
they
refused
to
answer
any
more
of
his
questions
and
except
for
an
occasional
hoarse
remark
to
one
another
in
italian
kept
a
rigid
silence
after
what
seemed
to
him
an
interminable
distance
they
apparently
reached
their
destination
for
he
was
dragged
up
a
flight
of
steps
into
some
building
whether
prison
castle
or
private
dwelling
he
was
unable
to
guess
a
door
was
flung
open
for
a
moment
he
heard
an
echo
of
voices
then
all
was
silent
he
was
alone
though
in
what
sort
of
apartment
he
had
no
means
of
judging
the
floor
felt
smooth
to
his
feet
as
if
made
of
tiles
and
the
walls
also
were
smooth
his
captors
had
not
untied
his
hands
but
he
kept
straining
at
the
rope
in
the
hope
of
freeing
himself
escape
was
the
uppermost
notion
in
his
mind
he
had
indeed
so
far
succeeded
in
loosening
his
bonds
that
he
could
almost
slip
one
hand
out
at
that
crisis
however
the
door
opened
and
he
was
once
more
led
forth
where
are
you
taking
me
now
he
demanded
angrily
to
our
captain
replied
the
same
foreign
voice
which
had
given
him
his
former
information
while
two
strong
pairs
of
arms
pushed
him
along
though
his
bandage
was
very
thick
he
could
tell
that
he
was
passing
from
comparative
darkness
into
a
brilliantly
lighted
room
he
had
a
strong
sense
that
it
was
full
of
people
he
even
thought
he
heard
a
murmur
of
sympathy
which
was
however
instantly
suppressed
was
not
a
nature
to
be
cowed
by
any
circumstances
however
appalling
he
meant
to
show
this
rascally
crew
that
an
englishman
never
loses
his
pluck
and
in
spite
of
the
ropes
that
bound
him
he
stepped
forward
with
all
the
courage
and
pride
of
a
true
ingleton
am
i
speaking
to
the
captain
he
said
in
a
calm
clear
tone
then
signore
i
wish
to
inform
you
that
you
have
made
a
mistake
i
am
no
wealthy
english
landowner
as
you
can
very
soon
find
out
for
yourselves
and
i
may
add
that
if
i
were
i
stay
here
to
all
eternity
sooner
than
give
you
a
penny
of
ransom
hurrah
came
from
a
voice
close
behind
him
a
voice
which
sounded
so
familiar
that
everard
forgetting
his
bandage
turned
in
much
perplexity
the
signore
inglese
had
better
humble
himself
to
our
captain
murmured
his
guide
remember
that
here
he
has
the
power
of
life
and
death
i
humble
myself
to
nobody
thundered
everard
as
angry
as
a
lion
at
bay
untie
my
hands
you
cowards
and
i
fight
for
my
life
if
an
ounce
of
pluck
among
you
you
give
me
a
sporting
chance
ecco
e
giusto
said
a
fresh
voice
presumably
that
of
the
captain
signore
you
shall
have
your
will
at
this
a
knife
was
passed
rapidly
through
the
ropes
that
bound
him
and
at
the
same
moment
a
hand
snatched
the
bandage
from
his
eyes
dazed
with
the
sudden
light
everard
stared
round
as
one
in
a
dream
he
had
expected
to
find
himself
in
some
rough
hall
surrounded
by
brigands
and
lo
and
behold
he
was
in
the
at
the
casa
bianca
in
the
midst
of
the
united
family
forgive
our
rough
joke
everard
exclaimed
greville
clapping
him
heartily
on
the
shoulder
i
had
never
intended
to
let
it
go
so
far
i
thought
a
fight
on
the
road
would
do
you
no
harm
for
there
dangers
in
sicily
to
reckless
young
strangers
who
like
to
run
risks
and
you
might
easily
have
found
yourself
in
greater
trouble
than
you
imagine
at
targia
vecchia
if
i
had
not
sent
tomaso
to
shadow
you
the
people
down
there
know
his
reputation
with
a
revolver
and
do
care
to
interfere
never
mind
lad
you
came
very
well
out
of
it
you
certainly
showed
us
what
you
were
made
of
just
now
on
the
whole
i
think
you
turned
the
tables
on
us
everard
was
still
standing
gazing
round
the
room
at
ernesto
and
vittore
who
had
been
his
captors
at
greville
at
aimée
and
rosalia
who
were
laughing
at
the
joke
he
turned
white
and
red
with
passion
and
for
the
moment
looked
capable
of
knocking
down
ernesto
as
he
had
threatened
to
treat
the
supposed
brigands
a
glance
from
stacey
however
steadied
him
above
everything
everard
was
a
gentleman
by
a
supreme
effort
he
controlled
himself
i
think
it
an
abominable
shame
declared
carmel
turning
upon
ernesto
with
blazing
eyes
daddy
never
meant
you
to
bind
him
and
bring
him
up
here
like
that
only
to
frighten
him
for
a
minute
on
the
road
you
know
he
did
i
never
forgive
you
ernesto
if
this
is
a
specimen
of
our
sicilian
hospitality
everard
wo
want
to
come
to
the
casa
bianca
again
my
cousins
did
treat
me
to
practical
jokes
at
the
chase
they
gave
me
an
english
welcome
let
me
make
peace
said
signora
greville
coming
forward
and
taking
everard
hand
in
her
pretty
italian
fashion
our
guest
knows
i
hope
that
we
meant
no
discourtesy
to
him
for
all
he
has
suffered
we
claim
his
pardon
is
it
not
so
ernesto
and
vittore
he
has
indeed
shown
us
how
a
brave
englishman
can
behave
in
a
position
of
danger
and
we
admire
his
courage
i
think
we
ought
to
congratulate
him
on
the
splendid
way
he
has
taken
a
joke
which
certainly
went
much
farther
than
was
intended
at
that
everybody
crowded
round
everard
making
pretty
speeches
for
all
realized
that
the
mock
adventure
had
been
real
enough
to
him
at
the
time
i
should
faint
if
i
thought
i
were
taken
by
a
brigand
shivered
aimée
i
should
die
outright
declared
rosalia
your
property
is
back
in
your
pocket
with
my
sincere
apologies
murmured
vittore
restoring
the
watch
and
other
valuables
it
was
not
until
the
next
morning
that
everard
had
an
opportunity
to
give
carmel
the
peasant
necklace
for
which
he
had
ventured
down
to
targia
vecchia
her
delight
was
immense
why
it
the
very
one
i
wanted
she
exclaimed
it
will
be
the
gem
of
my
whole
collection
i
shall
always
call
it
the
brigand
necklace
after
this
you
went
through
a
great
deal
to
bring
it
back
everard
oh
never
mind
that
all
over
and
finished
with
now
i
going
to
forget
it
you
may
forget
it
but
i
sha
i
shall
always
remember
how
you
called
them
cowards
and
asked
for
a
sporting
chance
i
must
say
i
like
men
to
be
able
to
take
care
of
themselves
as
for
signor
ernesto
i
forgiven
him
yet
and
on
the
whole
i
not
altogether
quite
sure
that
i
ever
shall
chapter
xix
at
palermo
it
was
perhaps
to
atone
for
the
indignities
which
everard
had
suffered
at
the
hands
of
ernesto
and
vittore
in
the
practical
joke
that
they
had
played
upon
him
that
signor
trapani
proposed
to
take
the
ingletons
for
a
few
days
trip
to
palermo
he
declared
he
could
not
allow
them
to
leave
sicily
without
a
peep
at
the
famous
capital
city
and
that
in
motoring
there
they
could
also
see
some
of
the
sights
upon
the
way
though
they
were
perfectly
happy
at
casa
bianca
a
visit
to
palermo
was
of
course
a
great
attraction
and
the
party
including
cousin
clare
and
stacey
were
all
excitement
and
smiles
we
to
stay
at
an
hotel
announced
carmel
and
ernesto
and
vittore
are
to
have
dinner
with
us
and
douglas
too
added
dulcie
with
satisfaction
i
heard
your
uncle
say
he
had
asked
him
oh
did
he
i
so
glad
now
we
shall
have
plenty
of
cavaliers
to
take
us
about
what
fun
it
will
be
you
just
love
palermo
i
always
sing
a
jubilee
when
mother
has
a
shopping
expedition
there
and
wants
me
to
go
with
her
hurrah
for
then
proclaimed
dulcie
taking
only
a
little
light
luggage
the
lucky
travelers
packed
themselves
into
two
cars
and
set
off
on
their
leaving
the
sea
they
turned
inland
to
the
mountain
region
and
with
a
short
stop
at
centuripe
to
get
the
magnificent
view
of
etna
they
motored
on
to
castrogiovanni
a
wonderful
old
town
set
like
an
eagle
nest
on
the
very
crest
of
a
high
hill
and
full
of
relics
of
greeks
carthaginians
romans
saracens
and
normans
who
had
held
its
fortress
in
turns
it
looked
the
real
brigand
stronghold
of
old
stories
as
impregnable
as
some
of
our
scottish
castles
and
a
fit
subject
for
legend
one
feature
of
the
sicilian
landscape
greatly
struck
the
ingletons
there
are
no
cottages
scattered
about
like
we
have
in
england
remarked
lilias
do
the
people
who
work
in
the
fields
all
live
in
these
little
towns
on
the
tops
of
hills
why
do
they
have
their
homes
close
to
their
work
it
an
old
sicilian
custom
explained
signor
trapani
in
former
days
there
were
so
many
robbers
that
nobody
would
have
dared
to
live
alone
in
a
cottage
in
the
open
country
even
now
it
would
scarcely
be
thought
wise
and
the
peasants
feel
far
safer
at
night
in
a
town
with
their
neighbors
to
help
to
protect
them
and
their
valuables
a
sicilian
peasant
would
rather
walk
many
miles
to
his
fields
than
run
the
risk
of
brigands
stealing
his
savings
nearly
everybody
keeps
a
few
goats
and
each
morning
the
goatherd
blows
a
horn
and
leads
the
flock
of
the
whole
town
out
to
pasture
he
keeps
guard
over
them
all
day
and
brings
them
back
in
the
evening
when
each
trots
home
to
its
own
stable
to
be
milked
the
children
often
wait
at
the
city
gate
to
welcome
the
goats
back
and
you
can
see
quite
affectionate
little
meetings
between
them
kids
welcoming
kids
murmured
dulcie
who
clung
to
schoolgirl
slang
rather
to
the
consternation
of
signor
trapani
who
did
not
always
understand
it
and
much
to
the
indignation
of
cousin
clare
who
was
continually
urging
her
to
speak
pure
english
from
castrogiovanni
the
way
lay
down
hill
to
palermo
which
they
reached
in
the
evening
just
when
a
golden
sunset
was
lighting
up
its
houses
its
beautiful
gardens
and
magnificent
harbor
ernesto
vittore
and
douglas
were
waiting
for
them
at
the
hotel
so
they
made
a
jolly
party
of
ten
at
dinner
and
had
a
round
table
all
to
themselves
in
the
à
signor
trapani
in
his
enthusiasm
as
host
even
suggested
the
theater
afterwards
but
cousin
clare
said
no
after
such
a
long
motor
run
and
sent
the
girls
off
to
bed
they
may
go
and
see
an
italian
play
evening
if
you
work
them
too
hard
at
during
the
day
she
relented
but
remember
i
want
to
keep
the
roses
in
their
cheeks
and
lilias
at
any
rate
must
not
get
overdone
i
the
stern
chaperon
you
know
so
i
understand
laughed
signor
trapani
though
such
a
charming
lady
can
not
make
a
very
terrible
duenna
and
we
are
not
at
all
frightened
of
you
he
added
finishing
like
every
true
italian
with
a
compliment
lilias
dulcie
and
carmel
had
three
small
beds
in
a
room
that
led
out
of
cousin
clare
though
they
had
pretended
to
be
disappointed
at
not
being
allowed
to
go
to
the
theater
in
reality
they
were
all
extremely
tired
and
glad
to
rest
dulcie
in
particular
snuggled
down
on
her
pillow
and
was
asleep
even
before
lilias
turned
off
the
electric
light
the
others
were
not
long
in
following
suit
and
in
a
short
time
all
were
in
the
land
of
dreams
it
was
perhaps
two
in
the
morning
when
lilias
awoke
in
the
darkness
with
a
start
her
bed
was
shaking
violently
under
her
as
it
had
done
once
long
ago
when
everard
in
his
had
played
a
trick
upon
her
there
was
a
loud
rumbling
noise
like
the
passing
of
a
gigantic
or
a
railway
train
the
jugs
and
basins
were
rattling
and
a
glass
of
water
placed
on
the
edge
of
the
table
fell
to
the
ground
with
a
smash
what
is
it
oh
what
the
matter
cried
lilias
terribly
scared
she
put
out
her
hand
and
tried
to
turn
on
the
electric
light
but
she
moved
the
switch
in
vain
carmel
who
had
groped
for
the
matches
lighted
a
candle
and
by
the
time
the
welcome
little
yellow
flame
showed
itself
the
shaking
and
rumbling
had
entirely
ceased
lilias
looked
anxiously
round
the
room
what
the
matter
she
asked
again
only
an
earthquake
said
carmel
calmly
it
over
now
an
lilias
voice
was
tragic
just
a
slight
shock
we
often
have
them
will
the
walls
tumble
down
certainly
not
it
only
makes
the
china
rattle
by
this
time
cousin
clare
also
unaccustomed
to
earthquakes
and
almost
as
alarmed
as
lilias
came
into
the
room
carmel
pacified
them
both
assuring
them
that
such
tremors
were
of
quite
common
occurrence
and
that
people
in
sicily
thought
little
about
them
unless
they
were
severe
enough
to
do
damage
all
this
time
dulcie
pink
cheek
was
buried
in
the
pillow
and
her
breath
came
as
quietly
and
evenly
as
that
of
a
baby
i
glad
she
did
wake
she
was
very
tired
poor
child
commented
cousin
clare
after
a
glance
at
the
bed
in
the
corner
dulcie
was
of
course
unmercifully
teased
next
morning
for
having
slept
through
an
earthquake
if
etna
shot
its
cone
off
during
the
night
i
do
believe
it
would
wake
you
laughed
everard
the
seven
sleepers
are
nothing
to
you
go
on
rag
me
as
much
as
you
like
i
do
care
declared
dulcie
sturdily
i
think
i
had
far
the
best
of
it
you
were
all
awake
and
scared
while
i
was
snug
and
comfy
i
shall
sleep
through
the
next
if
we
have
one
ashamed
of
myself
not
a
bit
of
it
i
tell
you
i
everybody
was
looking
forward
to
a
day
in
palermo
and
as
soon
as
breakfast
was
over
the
party
started
out
to
view
the
cathedral
the
beautiful
palatine
chapel
with
its
saracen
arches
and
priceless
mosaics
and
the
ancient
norman
church
of
giovanni
degli
eremite
dulcie
who
had
been
learning
longfellow
of
for
her
last
recitation
in
the
elocution
class
at
school
was
much
thrilled
and
wanted
to
know
in
which
of
the
churches
he
had
made
his
famous
defiance
of
heaven
and
had
been
turned
from
his
throne
by
the
angel
who
temporarily
took
his
place
as
king
till
he
repented
of
his
vain
glory
nobody
could
tell
her
however
and
the
gave
no
information
on
the
subject
though
douglas
obligingly
searched
its
pages
knowing
she
loved
old
legends
about
the
places
he
found
another
item
of
interest
for
her
in
connection
with
one
of
the
ancient
towers
of
giovanni
degli
eremite
it
was
from
there
that
in
the
middle
ages
when
the
french
ruled
the
island
a
vesper
bell
had
tolled
the
signal
for
the
inhabitants
to
rise
and
fall
upon
their
cruel
masters
in
a
massacre
that
was
known
ever
afterwards
as
the
sicilian
vespers
bells
have
never
been
rung
in
sicily
since
said
douglas
then
as
dulcie
eyebrows
went
up
in
amazed
contradiction
he
explained
they
are
never
really
here
in
most
countries
the
bells
swing
backwards
and
forwards
but
in
our
churches
they
are
quite
steady
and
only
the
clapper
moves
about
inside
the
bell
oh
that
why
they
sound
so
frightfully
clangy
then
we
noticed
the
difference
at
once
when
we
came
over
from
malta
yes
you
would
the
church
bells
of
malta
are
the
most
beautiful
in
the
world
they
partly
made
of
silver
and
they
swing
properly
in
the
belfries
i
love
to
see
really
sicilian
things
then
you
shall
put
in
signor
trapani
we
try
and
show
you
the
local
color
of
palermo
oh
please
do
i
like
to
watch
how
the
people
live
in
order
to
keep
his
promise
to
dulcie
signor
trapani
took
his
guests
to
have
lunch
at
a
restaurant
near
the
harbor
where
instead
of
the
usual
french
menu
which
obtained
at
all
the
hotels
purely
sicilian
dishes
were
served
first
came
a
species
of
marine
soup
that
consisted
of
tiny
and
stewed
till
they
were
very
tender
then
smothered
in
white
sauce
slices
of
tunny
fish
followed
almost
as
substantial
as
beefsteak
then
some
goats
flesh
that
closely
resembled
mutton
and
with
it
a
vegetable
called
fennel
which
is
rather
like
celery
with
a
dash
of
aniseed
about
it
the
salad
chiefly
of
endive
was
smothered
in
lucca
oil
and
tarragon
vinegar
and
there
was
an
entrée
that
seemed
made
mostly
of
butter
and
cheese
dulcie
daunted
by
nothing
ate
each
new
dish
and
said
she
enjoyed
it
though
lilias
and
cousin
clare
could
not
be
induced
even
to
taste
the
unaccustomed
food
and
lunched
on
omelettes
which
were
ordered
specially
for
their
benefit
stacey
and
everard
however
were
hearty
converts
to
sicilian
cookery
and
declared
they
would
like
some
of
the
courses
introduced
at
the
chase
when
they
returned
to
england
as
good
luck
would
have
it
dulcie
was
just
stepping
out
of
the
restaurant
when
she
heard
a
familiar
squeaking
voice
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
saw
a
sicilian
punch
and
judy
show
naturally
she
demanded
to
stop
and
witness
the
representation
punchinello
though
his
speeches
were
in
italian
went
through
the
same
series
of
wicked
deeds
as
in
england
and
little
dog
toby
with
a
frill
round
his
neck
assisted
in
the
performance
dulcie
was
delighted
and
was
persuaded
to
get
into
the
waiting
motor
only
by
bribes
of
seeing
even
more
interesting
sights
the
lovely
public
gardens
the
shops
the
market
the
university
where
ernesto
vittore
and
douglas
were
studying
the
museum
and
various
beautiful
spots
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
city
were
all
visited
during
the
ingletons
brief
stay
at
palermo
and
they
celebrated
the
last
evening
by
a
visit
to
the
theater
where
if
they
could
not
understand
the
words
of
the
play
the
dramatic
foreign
acting
spoke
for
itself
has
my
little
english
signorina
enjoyed
her
trip
asked
signor
trapani
kindly
as
dulcie
sitting
by
his
side
in
the
car
waved
an
enthusiastic
to
palermo
enjoyed
it
it
the
loveliest
place
on
earth
and
beats
london
hollow
in
my
opinion
but
i
love
everything
sicilian
much
thanks
just
immensely
for
giving
me
such
a
perfectly
delicious
time
declared
dulcie
screwing
her
neck
round
to
catch
a
last
glimpse
of
ernesto
vittore
and
douglas
who
stood
by
the
roadside
fluttering
handkerchiefs
as
a
signal
of
farewell
chapter
xx
old
england
the
holiday
in
sicily
like
all
pleasant
things
came
to
an
end
at
last
and
the
ingleton
family
leaving
the
casa
bianca
with
many
regrets
returned
to
their
own
country
in
time
to
welcome
roland
bevis
and
clifford
back
from
school
for
easter
carmel
who
had
seemed
keenly
to
feel
the
parting
from
her
mother
and
who
had
been
so
quiet
on
the
journey
that
her
cousins
suspected
a
bad
attack
of
homesickness
cheered
up
when
they
were
once
more
settled
at
the
chase
the
beauties
of
the
english
with
primroses
cowslips
green
meadows
and
budding
woodlands
compared
very
favorably
with
even
the
lovely
sicilian
landscape
and
carmel
acknowledged
frankly
that
cheverley
had
a
charm
all
of
its
own
i
never
knew
how
much
i
loved
it
till
i
left
it
and
then
saw
it
again
she
declared
there
something
about
the
place
that
grips
your
ingleton
blood
showing
of
course
remarked
everard
all
your
ancestors
have
lived
at
the
chase
and
it
would
be
queer
if
you
some
sort
of
a
natural
feeling
for
it
people
mostly
have
for
the
place
where
their
ancestors
were
born
indeed
i
believe
my
ancestors
were
all
of
them
born
in
bed
so
no
doubt
that
why
i
have
such
a
natural
feeling
for
bed
and
do
want
to
get
up
in
the
mornings
piped
dulcie
who
never
could
resist
a
quip
at
everard
i
do
despise
old
england
but
sicily
the
land
for
me
and
i
going
back
to
montalesso
some
day
aunt
nita
says
so
lilias
can
please
herself
but
as
soon
as
bowden
lets
me
leave
school
i
shall
say
i
off
to
the
land
of
oranges
and
lemons
and
in
the
meantime
you
have
to
make
up
at
school
for
this
long
holiday
reminded
cousin
clare
i
afraid
you
find
yourself
terribly
behindhand
when
you
get
back
to
chilcombe
the
occupants
of
the
blue
grotto
had
much
to
talk
about
when
they
met
again
it
was
hateful
having
the
dor
all
to
ourselves
confided
gowan
we
never
had
such
a
slow
time
in
our
lives
we
had
a
fearful
scare
too
we
thought
miss
walters
was
going
to
put
laurette
with
us
she
had
a
terrible
quarrel
with
truie
and
hester
and
things
were
rather
hot
in
the
gold
bedroom
fortunately
however
they
cooled
down
and
patched
up
their
quarrels
bertha
and
i
were
simply
shaking
though
i
heard
miss
walters
say
to
laurette
a
spare
bed
at
present
in
the
blue
room
and
we
thought
she
was
moving
in
for
the
rest
of
the
term
think
of
being
boxed
up
with
laurette
would
it
have
been
absolutely
grisly
nothing
at
all
particularly
exciting
happened
while
you
were
away
groused
bertha
we
got
all
the
drudgery
and
you
had
all
the
fun
but
we
brought
you
some
presents
just
wait
till
i
get
to
the
bottom
of
my
box
put
in
carmel
oh
have
you
cried
bertha
excitedly
what
have
you
brought
stop
to
arrange
those
blouses
dump
your
things
out
anyhow
i
wait
i
never
had
a
foreign
present
in
my
life
before
what
an
absolutely
ducky
little
locket
carmel
you
a
darling
you
could
have
given
me
anything
in
the
whole
of
this
wide
world
that
i
should
have
liked
better
i
just
love
it
though
the
ingletons
immediate
friends
at
chilcombe
had
been
rather
inclined
to
look
with
the
green
eyes
of
envy
upon
their
long
holiday
in
sicily
and
consequent
immunity
from
easter
examinations
they
were
mollified
by
the
pretty
gifts
which
the
girls
had
brought
them
and
while
they
still
proclaimed
them
luckers
out
of
all
reason
they
forgave
them
their
good
fortune
and
received
them
back
once
more
into
the
bosom
of
their
special
clique
the
mafia
had
indeed
languished
considerably
during
their
absence
nobody
had
troubled
very
much
to
keep
up
its
activities
and
it
had
held
only
one
or
two
meetings
now
that
its
nine
members
were
together
again
however
the
secret
society
set
to
work
with
renewed
vigor
insensibly
it
had
rather
altered
its
scope
it
had
begun
originally
for
the
purpose
of
resisting
the
aggressions
of
laurette
hester
and
truie
but
had
grown
into
a
sort
of
confraternity
for
private
fun
the
meetings
held
in
each
dormitories
were
of
a
hilarious
description
and
included
games
at
gowan
suggestion
they
even
went
a
step
farther
and
produced
literary
contributions
of
a
sort
as
she
wisely
qualified
the
rather
appalling
innovation
i
do
mean
exactly
shakespeare
you
know
she
explained
but
you
can
write
poetry
if
you
care
to
or
make
up
something
funny
like
everybody
has
got
to
do
something
not
really
objected
dulcie
wrinkling
her
forehead
into
lines
of
acute
distress
oh
goody
it
as
bad
as
lessons
every
bit
look
here
i
not
clever
and
i
do
make
any
pretence
at
poetry
or
the
rest
of
it
you
just
have
to
leave
me
out
pull
yourself
together
dulcie
my
child
said
gowan
calmly
either
be
turned
bodily
out
of
the
mafia
or
you
do
your
bit
the
same
as
everybody
else
do
for
a
moment
imagine
you
coming
to
listen
to
other
people
industry
and
bring
nothing
of
your
own
with
you
that
not
the
way
we
manage
things
here
if
you
do
show
up
with
a
manuscript
in
your
hand
you
find
yourself
walking
down
the
passage
with
the
door
slammed
behind
you
yes
i
mean
it
you
a
decent
enough
little
person
but
you
apt
to
be
slack
you
must
get
some
stiffening
into
you
this
time
poor
little
me
wailed
dulcie
no
poorer
than
all
the
rest
of
us
yes
i
am
for
i
have
got
the
same
thingumbobs
in
my
brains
could
make
up
poetry
to
save
my
life
may
i
write
a
letter
why
yes
if
you
rather
i
feel
it
would
be
my
most
adequate
form
of
minced
dulcie
mimicking
miss
walters
very
best
literary
manner
i
trust
my
contribution
will
be
kept
for
publication
later
on
when
i
famous
it
may
become
of
value
the
world
will
never
forget
that
i
was
educated
at
chilcombe
hall
a
neat
brass
plate
will
some
day
be
placed
upon
the
door
of
the
blue
grotto
to
mark
the
dormitory
i
slept
in
and
my
bed
will
be
preserved
in
the
local
museum
with
you
stuffed
inside
it
labeled
of
a
champion
slacker
snorted
gowan
now
no
nonsense
if
you
do
turn
up
at
the
meeting
with
a
manuscript
you
wo
be
admitted
how
very
severe
we
grown
all
of
a
sudden
mocked
dulcie
as
she
danced
away
you
take
it
for
granted
she
called
over
her
shoulder
that
my
contribution
is
going
to
mark
the
literary
low
tide
perhaps
after
all
it
will
make
as
big
an
impression
as
anybody
else
there
on
the
evening
fixed
for
the
meeting
nine
girls
put
in
an
appearance
at
the
blue
grotto
all
flaunting
manuscripts
in
a
very
conspicuous
fashion
they
seated
themselves
upon
bertha
and
dulcie
beds
and
having
as
a
kind
of
foregone
conclusion
elected
gowan
as
president
of
the
ceremonies
got
straight
to
business
gowan
was
justice
personified
and
fearful
of
even
unintentional
favoritism
she
insisted
upon
the
company
drawing
lots
for
the
order
in
which
their
effusions
were
to
be
read
the
fates
decided
thus
carmel
noreen
edith
lilias
gowan
bertha
prissie
phillida
dulcie
carmel
hustled
off
the
bed
to
be
given
first
hearing
took
the
chair
of
honor
reserved
for
each
literary
star
in
turn
and
having
waited
a
moment
to
allow
undue
giggling
to
subside
opened
her
sheets
of
exercise
paper
and
began
old
england
i
never
can
quite
see
why
it
is
called
england
because
i
do
suppose
it
is
any
older
than
any
other
part
of
the
world
really
but
perhaps
is
a
term
of
endearment
because
i
notice
when
any
girl
likes
me
she
generally
calls
me
sport
or
thing
well
at
any
rate
here
i
am
back
in
old
england
and
it
is
a
wonderfully
nice
sort
of
a
country
i
specially
like
the
policemen
who
wave
their
white
gloves
and
stop
all
the
traffic
in
the
street
in
a
second
and
the
railway
porters
who
yell
out
the
names
of
the
stations
and
the
little
boys
who
cry
the
newspapers
there
are
no
beggars
in
old
england
like
there
are
in
sicily
and
no
mosquitoes
and
no
earthquakes
at
least
not
proper
ones
i
thought
we
were
all
beggars
when
we
tried
to
raise
money
for
the
and
strays
bertha
buzzes
worse
than
any
mosquito
when
she
wants
to
borrow
my
penknife
and
i
thought
there
was
an
earthquake
the
last
time
laurette
danced
i
like
all
the
old
houses
and
castles
and
cathedrals
in
old
england
and
especially
the
old
gardens
what
i
do
like
are
my
old
lessons
old
england
is
a
jolly
hospitable
comfortable
green
sort
of
country
and
i
am
quite
at
home
here
now
so
hurrah
old
england
for
ever
carmel
having
read
her
manuscript
as
rapidly
as
possible
vacated
the
chair
in
a
breathless
condition
and
pushed
noreen
into
her
place
noreen
had
been
struggling
with
pegasus
and
had
produced
a
spring
poem
it
was
short
but
perhaps
a
trifle
to
my
spring
is
comen
back
again
daisy
buds
for
my
dearie
gone
is
winter
snow
and
rain
cherry
lips
for
my
dearie
blossom
clothes
the
orchards
now
apple
cheeks
for
my
dearie
nests
of
birds
on
every
bough
and
kisses
for
my
dearie
it
one
of
those
sort
of
things
i
believe
you
call
them
madrigals
she
ventured
nobody
else
knew
what
a
madrigal
was
so
they
took
noreen
word
for
it
and
allowed
her
to
retire
in
favor
of
edith
who
had
also
been
trying
to
cultivate
the
muse
of
poetry
her
effort
at
verse
was
entitled
miranda
music
miranda
had
learnt
the
piano
to
play
and
when
seated
one
day
on
the
stool
at
her
latest
new
piece
she
was
strumming
away
for
old
thomas
who
sweeps
out
the
school
thought
she
will
impress
him
if
anything
will
for
the
left
hand
goes
over
the
right
he
will
surely
admire
my
exquisite
skill
and
perhaps
will
express
his
delight
but
ah
fondest
hopes
may
be
dashed
to
the
ground
despite
what
ambition
can
raise
ill
pleased
by
this
banquet
of
beautiful
sound
old
thomas
was
scant
in
his
praise
ay
yes
i
hear
is
not
bad
to
be
sure
they
may
teach
you
in
time
so
he
grumbled
but
was
plain
that
he
thought
the
performance
but
poor
and
miranda
felt
terribly
humbled
one
morn
when
six
months
had
swift
glided
away
again
at
the
instrument
seated
miranda
a
nocturne
had
just
ceased
to
play
when
old
thomas
desired
it
repeated
miss
he
declared
can
hardly
believe
that
you
made
such
improvement
so
soon
the
last
time
you
played
you
to
jump
your
hand
before
you
could
pick
out
the
tune
humpety
lump
in
the
treble
at
top
then
same
hand
would
return
to
the
bass
but
now
i
can
see
they
have
taught
you
to
keep
each
hand
in
its
own
proper
place
it
a
really
true
story
persisted
edith
as
the
girls
giggled
it
happened
to
my
sister
she
always
plays
at
the
band
of
hope
concerts
in
our
village
at
home
and
she
goes
down
to
the
school
to
practise
her
solos
on
the
piano
there
old
thomas
is
the
verger
and
he
such
a
queer
old
character
he
really
think
she
did
know
how
to
play
properly
when
she
crossed
her
hands
over
and
he
told
her
so
it
was
a
tremendous
joke
in
our
family
because
maisie
considers
herself
musical
she
was
squashed
absolutely
flat
neither
lilias
gowan
bertha
prissie
nor
phillida
had
written
anything
very
original
or
outstanding
in
their
manuscripts
so
we
will
pass
them
over
and
only
record
that
of
dulcie
who
came
last
of
all
she
took
the
honored
seat
with
a
great
air
of
nodded
triumphantly
to
gowan
cleared
her
throat
commanded
strict
silence
and
began
chilcombe
hall
my
dear
everard
i
must
write
at
once
and
tell
you
of
the
terrible
things
that
have
been
happening
at
this
school
on
monday
last
the
cook
made
a
mistake
and
used
a
packet
of
rat
poison
instead
of
sugar
in
our
pudding
it
was
the
day
for
ginger
puddings
and
we
all
thought
they
tasted
rather
queer
somehow
but
it
is
not
etiquette
here
to
leave
anything
on
your
plate
so
we
made
an
effort
and
finished
our
rations
well
about
ten
minutes
afterwards
most
of
us
were
taken
with
umpteen
fits
we
writhed
about
the
room
in
agony
and
thought
our
last
hour
had
come
the
doctor
was
sent
for
and
he
motored
over
so
fast
that
he
killed
two
little
boys
and
a
cow
on
the
road
but
he
said
he
did
not
care
and
it
was
all
in
the
way
of
business
he
stood
us
up
in
a
line
and
gave
us
each
an
emetic
of
mustard
and
water
which
was
very
horrid
and
felt
like
a
poultice
inside
we
are
beginning
to
get
better
now
but
carmel
legs
are
stiff
and
she
has
a
tendency
to
go
black
in
the
face
every
now
and
then
the
doctor
says
she
will
do
so
for
a
fortnight
until
the
rat
poison
wears
itself
out
of
her
system
he
does
not
think
she
will
be
lame
always
at
least
he
hopes
not
lilias
squints
a
little
in
consequence
of
the
umpteen
fits
she
had
which
turned
her
eyes
round
and
my
face
is
still
swollen
and
three
front
teeth
dropped
out
but
otherwise
we
are
quite
well
and
the
doctor
says
things
might
have
been
much
worse
for
at
least
our
lives
were
spared
i
think
we
ought
to
see
a
specialist
but
miss
walters
wo
hear
of
it
hoping
you
are
quite
well
with
love
your
affectionate
sister
dulcie
do
say
i
ca
write
fiction
proclaimed
dulcie
making
a
grimace
at
gowan
it
as
good
as
a
novel
though
i
say
it
myself
and
as
interesting
as
anything
in
a
newspaper
improbable
not
at
all
cooks
make
mistakes
sometimes
like
other
people
i
do
exactly
know
the
symptoms
of
rat
poisoning
but
i
dare
say
they
are
very
much
what
described
it
thrilling
reading
anyhow
and
you
ought
to
give
me
a
good
clap
for
it
somebody
has
lost
a
trumpeter
returned
gowan
i
do
care
i
sure
if
we
took
votes
for
the
most
thrills
my
piece
would
win
i
going
to
keep
it
hand
it
back
to
me
gowan
i
want
to
show
it
to
everard
some
time
he
laugh
ever
so
over
it
he
says
my
home
letters
are
tame
this
would
wake
him
up
at
any
rate
he
say
his
sister
was
breaking
out
into
an
authoress
what
sport
chapter
xxi
carmel
kingdom
the
day
following
the
secret
meeting
of
the
mafia
was
one
of
those
devoted
to
home
correspondence
the
girls
were
alloted
forty
minutes
during
school
hours
they
brought
their
into
the
and
scribbled
off
as
many
letters
as
possible
during
the
brief
time
allowed
on
this
particular
wednesday
dulcie
was
much
in
arrears
she
wrote
three
letters
to
sicily
one
to
an
aunt
in
london
a
short
scrawl
to
everard
and
was
beginning
my
dear
cousin
clare
when
miss
hardy
entered
the
room
in
a
hurry
jones
has
to
leave
half
an
hour
earlier
she
announced
and
he
wants
to
take
the
now
be
quick
girls
and
give
me
your
letters
a
general
scramble
of
finishing
and
stamping
ensued
dulcie
who
had
not
addressed
her
envelopes
folded
her
loose
sheets
anyhow
and
trusted
to
luck
that
the
foreign
letters
were
not
i
ca
help
it
if
they
have
to
pay
extra
on
them
she
confided
to
carmel
they
look
rather
heavy
certainly
but
i
had
any
thin
note
paper
you
see
douglas
will
pay
up
cheerfully
i
sure
how
do
you
know
that
his
was
a
heavy
one
oh
i
can
guess
i
was
only
answering
a
number
of
questions
he
asked
me
it
very
unkind
not
to
answer
people
questions
most
decidedly
i
quite
agree
with
you
laughed
carmel
the
letters
were
posted
in
glazebrook
that
evening
by
the
factotum
jones
and
dulcie
though
her
thoughts
might
possibly
follow
the
particular
heavy
envelope
addressed
to
montalesso
dismissed
her
other
items
of
correspondence
completely
from
her
mind
she
was
taking
a
run
round
the
garden
the
next
morning
at
eleven
break
when
to
her
immense
surprise
she
heard
a
trotting
of
horse
hoofs
on
the
drive
and
who
should
appear
but
everard
riding
rajah
the
rules
at
chilcombe
hall
were
strict
no
visits
were
allowed
even
from
brothers
without
special
permission
from
miss
walters
hitherto
everard
had
come
over
only
by
express
invitation
from
the
and
this
had
been
given
sparingly
at
discreet
intervals
and
always
for
the
afternoon
surely
some
most
unusual
circumstance
must
have
brought
him
to
school
at
the
early
hour
of
eleven
in
the
morning
dulcie
flew
across
the
lawn
calling
his
name
at
the
sight
of
his
sister
everard
dismounted
and
greeted
her
eagerly
hello
how
are
you
how
carmel
he
began
i
say
you
know
this
has
been
a
shocking
business
you
look
better
than
i
expected
scanning
her
face
narrowly
it
a
mercy
you
are
all
under
the
daisies
is
carmel
lame
what
about
those
fits
i
came
directly
i
read
your
letter
a
specialist
must
be
sent
for
at
once
i
ca
understand
miss
walters
taking
it
so
lightly
we
ought
to
have
been
told
at
once
directly
it
happened
as
everard
poured
forth
these
remarks
dulcie
expression
underwent
several
quick
changes
and
passed
from
astonishment
to
sudden
comprehension
and
mirth
we
better
thanks
she
choked
and
carmel
can
hobble
about
quite
well
on
her
crutches
and
her
face
is
black
now
not
like
it
was
at
first
though
of
course
she
still
has
the
fits
pretty
regularly
and
the
doctor
says
but
at
that
moment
her
mendacious
statement
was
contradicted
by
carmel
herself
who
came
running
over
the
lawn
with
an
agility
that
put
crutches
out
of
all
question
and
a
complexion
that
was
certainly
in
no
way
spoilt
it
was
everard
turn
to
look
amazed
he
glanced
in
much
perplexity
from
his
cousin
radiant
and
apparently
in
the
best
of
health
to
his
sister
who
was
almost
speechless
with
laughter
you
never
actually
my
letter
about
the
rat
poison
exploded
dulcie
i
explained
that
it
was
written
for
our
literary
evening
i
told
you
everard
i
only
sent
it
on
for
you
to
read
because
it
sounded
so
funny
and
i
was
rather
proud
of
it
you
told
me
nothing
of
the
sort
oh
but
i
did
indeed
unless
suddenly
sobering
down
unless
i
forgot
to
put
my
other
letter
into
the
envelope
and
only
sent
you
the
one
i
was
in
such
a
hurry
oh
is
it
just
like
me
poor
old
everard
i
never
meant
to
give
you
such
a
scare
frightfully
sorry
umpteen
apologies
then
is
the
whole
business
fiction
demanded
her
brother
with
knitted
brows
oh
everard
do
be
angry
implored
carmel
dulcie
did
mean
to
rag
you
we
were
having
a
jolly
evening
and
each
of
us
had
to
write
something
the
funnier
the
better
and
that
was
dulcie
contribution
she
said
she
was
going
to
send
it
to
you
to
make
you
laugh
but
of
course
she
meant
to
put
in
her
other
letter
to
explain
that
this
was
only
nonsense
but
miss
hardy
came
in
such
a
hurry
and
whisked
all
our
letters
off
before
we
had
time
to
read
them
over
or
hardly
to
put
them
in
the
right
envelopes
so
you
know
it
was
just
an
accident
i
rode
over
at
once
to
see
what
was
the
matter
everard
voice
still
sounded
offended
though
slightly
mollified
i
know
you
did
and
it
was
ever
so
kind
of
you
i
only
sorry
you
should
have
all
the
trouble
it
been
nice
to
see
you
though
and
we
do
thank
you
for
coming
it
must
be
a
relief
to
find
we
do
squint
or
hobble
on
crutches
added
dulcie
naughtily
how
we
explain
to
miss
walters
if
she
catches
you
i
better
be
going
declared
everard
is
that
your
ringing
well
i
glad
at
any
rate
to
find
you
all
right
sha
dare
to
believe
any
of
your
letters
in
future
dulcie
told
such
awful
lies
it
made
you
gasp
and
stretch
your
eyes
her
aunt
who
from
her
earliest
youth
had
kept
a
strict
regard
for
truth
attempted
to
believe
matilda
the
effort
very
nearly
killed
her
carmel
keep
my
bad
young
sister
in
order
if
you
can
she
needs
some
one
to
look
after
her
and
everard
with
a
hand
on
bridle
nodded
smilingly
after
the
girls
as
they
ran
towards
the
house
in
response
to
the
clanging
the
rest
of
the
summer
term
at
chilcombe
hall
seemed
to
pass
very
rapidly
away
and
the
space
in
this
book
is
not
enough
to
tell
all
that
the
girls
did
during
those
weeks
of
june
sunshine
and
july
heat
there
were
tennis
tournaments
and
archery
contests
cricket
matches
picnics
and
strawberry
feasts
as
well
as
the
more
sober
business
of
lessons
examinations
and
a
concert
to
which
parents
were
invited
to
carmel
it
was
the
pleasantest
term
she
had
spent
at
school
for
she
had
settled
down
now
into
english
ways
and
did
not
so
continually
feel
the
call
of
her
sicilian
home
the
hostage
as
dulcie
still
sometimes
laughingly
called
her
if
she
pined
for
the
casa
bianca
had
contrived
to
make
herself
happy
in
her
northern
surroundings
and
had
won
favor
with
everybody
school
girls
do
not
often
make
a
fuss
but
when
day
arrived
and
the
ingletons
drove
away
in
their
car
a
chorus
of
cheers
followed
them
from
the
doorstep
and
though
the
hoorays
were
given
to
all
three
without
discrimination
there
is
no
doubt
that
they
were
mainly
intended
for
carmel
she
a
sport
said
gowan
waving
in
reply
to
the
white
handkerchief
that
fluttered
a
farewell
i
do
know
any
chum
i
like
better
she
always
plays
the
game
somehow
does
she
rather
agreed
noreen
i
think
the
way
she
taken
her
place
at
cheverley
chase
without
cuckooing
all
that
family
out
or
making
them
jealous
is
just
marvelous
if
anybody
deserves
her
kingdom
princess
carmel
it
only
one
in
a
thousand
who
could
have
done
what
she
has
carmel
indeed
though
an
unacknowledged
sovereign
had
managed
to
win
all
hearts
at
the
chase
even
lilias
did
not
now
resent
the
ownership
of
one
who
so
rarely
urged
her
own
claims
insensibly
she
had
grown
fond
of
her
cousin
and
liked
her
company
the
summer
holiday
promised
to
be
as
pleasant
as
that
of
last
christmas
stacey
who
had
taken
his
vacation
in
june
and
july
had
returned
to
cheverley
in
time
to
greet
roland
bevis
and
clifford
a
welcome
state
of
affairs
to
cousin
clare
for
the
three
lively
boys
were
almost
beyond
her
management
and
needed
the
kindly
authority
which
the
tutor
knew
so
well
how
to
wield
without
friction
all
sorts
of
plans
for
enjoyment
were
in
the
air
a
visit
to
the
sea
a
motor
tour
a
garden
party
a
tennis
tournament
a
cricket
match
even
a
dance
at
the
chase
when
one
day
something
quite
unexpected
occurred
something
which
changed
the
entire
course
of
events
and
threw
the
thoughts
of
the
holiday
makers
into
a
new
channel
like
many
extraordinary
happenings
it
came
about
in
quite
an
ordinary
way
carmel
had
left
her
despatch
case
at
school
a
small
matter
indeed
but
fraught
with
big
consequences
as
she
wanted
some
convenient
safe
spot
in
which
to
deposit
note
paper
old
letters
sealing
wax
stamps
and
other
such
treasures
cousin
clare
allowed
her
to
take
possession
of
a
which
stood
on
the
study
table
it
had
belonged
to
old
ingleton
and
he
had
indeed
used
it
till
the
day
before
his
death
but
it
had
been
emptied
of
its
contents
by
bowden
and
was
now
placed
merely
as
an
ornament
in
the
window
it
was
a
large
desk
of
rosewood
handsomely
inlaid
with
brass
and
lined
with
purple
velvet
carmel
seized
upon
it
joyfully
and
began
to
transfer
some
of
her
many
belongings
to
its
hospitable
depths
it
was
well
fitted
for
there
was
an
with
a
silver
top
and
a
containing
a
seal
and
a
silver
pen
bowden
had
left
these
when
he
removed
the
papers
probably
considering
them
as
part
and
parcel
of
the
desk
carmel
lifted
out
the
to
admire
its
cover
but
though
it
came
out
fairly
easily
it
was
a
difficult
matter
to
fit
it
in
again
in
pushing
it
back
into
its
place
she
pulled
heavily
upon
the
small
wooden
division
between
its
socket
and
the
to
her
utter
surprise
her
action
released
a
spring
a
long
narrow
panel
below
the
fell
away
and
revealed
a
quite
unsuspected
secret
drawer
she
opened
it
in
much
excitement
inside
lay
a
folded
sheet
of
foolscap
paper
her
exclamation
had
called
lilias
and
dulcie
from
the
other
side
of
the
room
and
all
three
girls
admired
and
wondered
at
the
contrivance
of
the
secret
drawer
together
they
took
out
the
sheet
of
paper
unfolded
it
and
bent
their
heads
over
it
why
it
grandfather
writing
exclaimed
lilias
as
she
read
the
first
words
this
is
the
last
will
and
testament
of
me
leslie
ingleton
of
cheverley
chase
near
balderton
it
surely
not
another
will
fluttered
dulcie
carmel
said
nothing
her
eyes
were
devouring
the
contents
of
the
paper
she
read
it
through
carefully
to
the
end
then
she
asked
what
was
the
date
of
the
will
in
which
grandfather
left
the
chase
to
me
was
it
not
some
time
in
january
well
this
is
certainly
a
later
date
it
must
have
been
signed
the
very
day
before
he
died
does
it
make
any
difference
inquired
dulcie
breathlessly
carmel
had
taken
the
paper
away
from
her
cousins
and
stood
in
the
window
mastering
the
meaning
of
the
legal
language
she
read
a
certain
passage
over
and
over
again
carefully
before
she
answered
then
she
looked
out
through
the
study
window
that
window
with
its
wonderful
view
over
the
whole
range
of
the
ingleton
property
she
gazed
at
the
gardens
and
woods
and
fields
that
for
more
than
a
year
had
been
hers
and
hers
alone
the
estate
which
to
claim
as
heiress
she
had
been
brought
from
her
sicilian
home
all
the
difference
in
the
world
she
said
quietly
grandfather
changed
his
mind
at
the
last
and
left
the
chase
to
everard
after
all
to
everard
oh
carmel
are
you
certain
can
there
be
any
mistake
is
the
will
properly
signed
let
me
look
yes
it
seems
signed
and
witnessed
as
far
as
i
can
tell
what
are
you
going
to
do
shall
i
ring
up
mr
bowden
not
yet
please
begged
carmel
leave
me
a
moment
she
was
still
standing
gazing
out
through
the
window
over
the
english
woods
and
meadows
that
she
had
grown
to
love
so
dearly
those
wide
acres
of
which
any
one
might
have
been
proud
at
last
she
turned
round
and
answered
i
am
going
now
to
tell
the
news
to
the
rightful
owner
of
the
chase
everard
was
sitting
in
the
stone
in
the
garden
struggling
with
a
difficult
problem
in
mathematics
when
suddenly
through
the
doorway
danced
princess
carmel
an
excited
vision
with
carnation
cheeks
and
dark
eyes
twinkling
like
stars
she
stopped
on
the
threshold
and
dropped
him
a
pretty
curtsey
then
a
great
generous
light
seemed
to
shine
in
her
face
as
she
announced
signor
everard
allow
me
to
hand
you
back
your
inheritance
it
was
the
triumph
of
her
life
bowden
on
being
sent
for
to
examine
the
will
found
all
in
perfect
order
the
legacies
to
friends
and
to
the
other
grandchildren
were
exactly
the
same
as
in
the
former
will
the
only
difference
being
that
the
positions
of
the
two
cousins
were
reversed
carmel
receiving
a
handsome
sum
of
money
and
everard
inheriting
the
property
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
impetuous
old
squire
had
repented
his
hasty
decision
but
not
liking
to
confess
such
weakness
to
the
family
lawyer
had
drawn
up
his
own
will
and
hidden
it
in
the
secret
drawer
of
his
desk
possibly
he
himself
was
not
sure
which
of
the
two
documents
he
wished
to
stand
and
had
kept
this
in
reserve
while
he
vacillated
fate
for
a
year
and
a
half
had
decided
in
favor
of
carmel
then
the
eternal
balance
had
swung
slowly
back
it
seems
such
a
pity
that
the
desk
was
searched
properly
at
first
said
lilias
to
cousin
clare
think
of
all
the
trouble
it
would
have
prevented
if
we
had
only
known
about
that
secret
drawer
poor
everard
how
much
he
would
have
been
saved
and
how
immensely
much
he
would
have
lost
said
cousin
clare
this
of
character
has
been
everard
salvation
he
is
very
different
now
from
the
thoughtless
boy
who
looked
at
everything
from
his
own
point
of
view
he
has
learnt
some
of
stern
lessons
and
will
make
a
far
better
owner
of
the
chase
than
would
have
been
possible
without
passing
through
these
experiences
i
think
he
realizes
that
for
himself
and
would
not
wish
to
change
anything
that
has
happened
now
that
the
new
will
was
proved
and
cheverley
chase
was
no
longer
her
property
arose
the
immediate
question
of
carmel
future
she
settled
it
at
once
for
herself
and
in
spite
of
all
entreaties
to
remain
in
england
decided
to
return
to
her
sicilian
home
i
told
you
long
ago
everard
that
i
would
not
keep
your
inheritance
and
i
am
only
too
glad
to
hand
it
back
she
said
to
her
cousin
going
to
do
all
the
splendid
things
that
i
prophesied
take
your
degree
be
a
model
landowner
get
into
parliament
and
help
your
country
but
i
ca
do
it
alone
a
kingdom
needs
a
queen
as
well
as
a
king
carmel
the
chase
would
simply
be
an
empty
casket
without
you
the
very
heart
and
soul
of
it
all
i
will
let
you
go
now
dear
for
i
see
you
quite
determined
but
carmel
carmel
some
day
in
the
far
future
if
you
think
i
have
grown
into
anything
like
what
you
wish
me
to
be
then
i
shall
tell
you
that
your
throne
is
waiting
for
you
here
in
old
england
the
land
of
primroses
and
sweetbriar
and
true
hearts
carmel
and
i
shall
ask
you
to
leave
your
sicilian
flowers
and
scented
orange
groves
and
come
back
to
claim
your
kingdom
