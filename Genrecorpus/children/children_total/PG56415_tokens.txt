the
cordial

given
to
following

by
boy
readers
and
critics
both
though
from
very
different
led
to
the
writing
of
this
second
story
in
which
baseball
has
a
sufficiently
important
part
to
suggest
the
title
the
author
s
purpose
in
each
case
has
been
to
produce
a
readable
story
true
to
the

of
a
distinctly
american

true
to
athletics
in
their
better
spirit
and
character
and
manly
and
reasonable
ideal

he
has
not
succeeded
in
this
the
failure
can
certainly
not
be
charged

phil
did

from

field
the
western
contingent
were
established
among
the
pines
on
the
right
a
corner
in
sands
s
room
he
heard
voices
first
indistinct
then
somewhat
clearer
the
academy
through
the
trees
in
the
campus
woods
he
suddenly
turned
and
pulled
the
ball
down
the
main
street
of
seaton
making
the
nine
chapter
i
an
unwelcome
proposition
how
they
do
yell
where
s
your
patriotism
phil
to
be
hanging
round
in
this
gloomy
crowd
when
all
your
friends
are
howling
their
heads
off
outside
don
t
you
know
yale
won
the
game
why
aren
t
you
out
there
with
the
rest
philip
poole
looked
up
with
a
smile
but
did
not
reply
he
s
comforting
the
afflicted
said
dick
melvin
who
shared
with
poole
the
ownership
of
the
room
you
don
t
want
to
gloat
over
us
poor
harvardites
do
you
phil
thank
you
much
for
your
that
isn
t
the
reason
said
the
lad
after
a
pause
with
the
sober
look
in
his
big
eyes
that
made
him
seem
serious
even
when
his
feelings
inclined
in
the
opposite
direction
i
just
don
t
see
any
cause
for
such
a
racket
a
yale
football
victory
over
harvard
is
too
ordinary
an
occurrence
to
get
wild
the
chorus
of
hoots
and
groans
that
greeted
this
explanation
brought
a
smile
of
satisfaction
to
the
boy
s
face
he
was
the
youngest
of
the
company
only
in
his
second
year
at
seaton
the
others
were
mostly
seniors
as
melvin
s
however
and
in
a
measure
still
under
the
senior
s
care
poole
was
thrown
as
much
with
the
older
students
as
with
his
own
classmates
and
the
intimacy
thus
developed
had
served
both
to
sharpen
his
wits
and
to
give
him
practice
in
melvin
himself
had
not
been
at
seaton
much
longer
than
phil
he
had
entered
at
the
beginning
of
the
middle
year
an
unknown
boy
green
sanguine
eager
to
win
a
scholarship
and
so
relieve
his
father
of
some
of
the
expense
of
his
schooling
soon
however
fascinated
by
football
and
the
glamour
of
the
school
athletic
world
he
had
failed
to
subordinate
his
sport
to
the
real
objects
of
school
life
how
he
made
the
school
eleven
and
went
down
with
it
to
defeat
how
he
lost
his
scholarship
how
the
care
of
young
phil
suddenly
offered
him
by
the
lad
s
uncle
sobered
and
steadied
him
and
enabled
him
to
stay
in
school
how
he
and
john
curtis
fought
the
long
uphill
fight
to
develop
a
strong
team
and
finally
defeated
the
rival
school
this
has
already
been
told
in
another
book
and
can
only
be
referred
to
very
briefly
here
the
great
game
which
marked
the
climax
of
the
struggle
was
still
a
recent
event
you
didn
t
take
it
so
calmly
when
seaton
won
the
victory
two
weeks
ago
and
your
beloved
dick
spent
the
afternoon
kicking
the
ball
over
the
hillbury
said
varrell
a
tall
quiet
boy
with
keen
restless
eyes
that
followed
the
conversation
from
face
to
face
that
s
different
replied
poole
i
m
first
for
seaton
and
afterwards
for
yale
the
college
can
wait
until
i
get
that
will
be
a
long
time
yet
he
added
ruefully
if
what
i
was
told
in
the
algebra
class
holds
the
others
laughed
patronizingly
as
befitted
those
who
had
points
to
their
credit
on
preliminary
certificates
and
knew
cæsar
and
algebra
only
as
outgrown
they
had
never
been
he
s
playing
off
said
todd
suspiciously
i
don
t
doubt
he
drew
an
a
on
his
last
for
one
member
of
the
group
the
conversation
was
taking
an
unpleasant
turn
john
curtis
talked
as
unwillingly
about
examinations
or
entering
college
as
the
family
of
a
convict
on
prison
discipline
john
had
been
captain
of
the
football
team
a
player
with
a
record
already
courted
by
college
committees
on
the
lookout
for
good
material
for
varsity
elevens
the
glory
of
victory
still
rested
full
and
bright
upon
him
but
neither
the
adulation
of
comrades
nor
his
own
consciousness
of
achievement
could
make
up
to
him
for
his
failure
to
be
recommended
for
preliminaries
at
the
last
college
examinations
and
his
present
gloomy
outlook
let
s
see
what
they
re
doing
out
in
the
yard
he
said
abruptly
lifting
his
two
hundred
pounds
from
a
creaking
chair
bang
bang
bump
bang
went
a
heavy
object
down
the
stairs
melvin
jerked
the
door
open
in
season
to
hear
a
scurry
of
feet
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
and
the
slam
of
two
or
three
doors
this
thing
must
stop
do
you
hear
he
shouted
in
the
direction
from
which
the
sound
had
come
the
corridor
was
silent
no
one
answered
no
one
appeared
yet
behind
the
cracks
of
doors
ajar
were
uttered
low
chucklings
that
the
monitor
rather
suspected
than
heard
from
a
door
at
the
end
emerged
an
innocent
head
adorned
with
a
green
shade
who
are
you
bawling
at
anyway
a
fellow
can
t
study
in
this
place
however
much
he
tries
first
a
chump
fires
a
bowling
ball
downstairs
and
then
the
monitor
curdles
your
blood
with
his
apache
yells
i
d
rather
hear
the
ball
a
good
sight
it
isn
t
so
hard
on
the
you
tell
those
fellows
to
stop
that
thing
right
off
or
i
ll
report
every
one
of
tell
them
yourself
retorted
the
green
shade
i
m
not
their
inside
number
the
company
roared
with
laughter
there
s
no
more
fun
for
the
poor
fellows
in
this
hall
since
dick
was
put
over
it
said
curtis
no
he
takes
his
duties
seriously
commented
todd
what
did
you
do
to
them
monitor
he
asked
as
the
official
returned
put
em
on
probation
warned
them
replied
melvin
with
good
humor
undisturbed
who
was
that
you
were
laboring
with
what
cried
curtis
that
man
from
butte
who
looks
as
if
he
had
just
escaped
from
the
menagerie
that
s
the
one
replied
dick
though
he
isn
t
as
bad
as
all
that
he
s
a
bit
freakish
i
ll
not
so
much
of
a
freak
as
he
looks
said
todd
you
ought
to
have
seen
him
open
the
safe
down
at
morrison
s
they
d
lost
the
combination
and
the
clerks
had
been
guessing
and
twisting
and
pulling
at
the
knob
all
the
morning
then
this
tompkins
happened
in
and
took
a
try
at
it
he
had
the
door
open
in
two
minutes
just
listened
at
the
lock
till
he
heard
the
right
couldn
t
have
been
much
of
a
lock
said
curtis
come
on
let
s
see
what
s
doing
the
big
fellow
went
whistling
downstairs
followed
by
todd
and
poole
varrell
and
dickinson
the
runner
still
remained
the
latter
too
much
incapacitated
by
the
sprain
he
had
received
in
the
great
game
to
make
any
unnecessary
movements
the
former
apparently
uninterested
the
harvard
sympathizers
had
rallied
and
making
up
in
numbers
what
they
lacked
in
righteous
cause
were
shouting
across
the
yard
to
the
yale
band
drowning
cheers
of
exultation
with
more
vociferous
cheers
of
loyalty
the
fools
exclaimed
the
misanthropic
dickinson
who
cried
varrell
suddenly
roused
from
revery
why
those
fellows
out
there
wasting
their
time
and
strength
on
something
that
does
not
concern
them
at
oh
said
varrell
and
sank
back
again
into
his
chair
dickinson
and
melvin
exchanged
a
glance
of
surprise
they
knew
that
at
one
time
varrell
had
had
serious
trouble
with
his
ears
and
was
still
a
little
deaf
but
he
got
on
so
well
both
in
the
class
room
and
among
the
boys
that
it
seemed
hardly
possible
that
he
was
unable
to
hear
these
boisterous
shouts
outside
they
sat
a
few
minutes
longer
in
silence
listening
to
the
cheers
hurled
back
and
forth
across
the
yard
soon
throats
grew
weary
and
the
mood
changed
the
enthusiasts
beginning
to
be
conscious
as
they
stamped
their
feet
and
dug
their
hands
into
their
pockets
that
the
november
night
was
really
cold
bethought
themselves
of
warm
rooms
and
work
still
to
be
done
and
scattered
to
shelter
the
scamper
of
feet
was
heard
on
the
stairs
good
nights
were
exchanged
in
the
entries
and
shouted
from
the
windows
then
the
natural
quiet
again
prevailed
dick
said
dickinson
at
last
you
know
that
saville
has
left
yes
i
have
heard
so
replied
melvin
he
was
your
track
manager
wasn
t
he
who
will
take
his
place
you
answered
dickinson
calmly
melvin
laughed
i
see
myself
in
that
i
mean
what
i
say
went
on
dickinson
when
i
took
the
captaincy
of
the
track
team
it
was
only
on
condition
that
i
should
have
no
trouble
about
business
matters
so
they
appointed
saville
now
that
he
s
gone
i
must
have
another
man
just
as
that
s
mere
flattery
replied
dick
still
jesting
i
m
too
old
a
fish
to
nibble
at
that
kind
of
a
dickinson
grew
indignant
i
m
not
flattering
i
know
that
if
you
undertake
the
thing
it
will
be
well
but
i
don
t
want
it
pleaded
melvin
serious
at
last
there
are
twenty
fellows
who
would
be
delighted
to
serve
who
would
do
just
as
well
as
i
besides
i
play
football
and
who
ever
heard
of
a
football
player
acting
as
manager
i
played
too
didn
t
i
but
that
doesn
t
release
me
from
the
captaincy
i
m
sure
i
d
like
to
get
out
of
the
thing
as
much
as
a
man
who
can
do
a
quarter
in
fifty
seconds
can
t
expect
to
get
out
of
say
forty
exclaimed
dickinson
angrily
you
may
as
dick
laughed
there
was
nothing
so
certain
to
arouse
dickinson
s
ire
as
the
assumption
that
he
was
a
marvelous
runner
whose
records
could
be
counted
on
to
move
in
a
sliding
scale
downward
with
no
particular
limit
in
sight
this
sensitiveness
due
partly
to
the
boy
s
extreme
modesty
partly
to
his
fear
of
disappointing
such
high
expectations
his
comrades
had
played
on
to
their
amusement
more
than
once
i
think
i
ll
get
out
altogether
said
the
runner
gloomily
you
can
t
said
melvin
the
school
wouldn
t
let
then
i
ll
tell
you
what
i
do
dickinson
declared
giving
the
arm
of
the
chair
a
blow
with
his
fist
i
ll
insist
that
you
run
the
mile
again
as
you
did
last
no
sir
said
melvin
and
set
his
lips
you
ll
have
to
if
i
insist
upon
it
you
don
t
play
baseball
and
you
have
nothing
at
all
to
do
in
the
spring
i
can
bring
so
much
pressure
to
bear
upon
you
that
you
simply
can
t
to
this
melvin
made
no
immediate
reply
but
quietly
pondered
what
do
you
think
wrenn
said
dickinson
turning
to
varrell
who
had
been
a
silent
witness
to
the
conversation
isn
t
he
just
the
man
to
hold
the
confidence
of
the
school
and
he
couldn
t
be
expected
to
run
if
he
were
manager
could
he
of
course
not
replied
varrell
promptly
then
will
you
be
my
assistant
and
help
me
collect
the
money
demanded
melvin
turning
to
the
last
speaker
but
varrell
was
not
easily
caught
you
don
t
need
any
assistant
he
replied
with
a
grin
you
re
equal
to
it
all
yourself
the
athletic
association
wouldn
t
elect
me
don
t
be
too
sure
of
that
remarked
dickinson
the
trio
parted
with
the
question
still
unsettled
that
was
great
generalship
said
dickinson
to
himself
exultantly
as
he
limped
downstairs
he
s
scared
as
death
of
the
mile
run
i
guess
i
ll
land
chapter
ii
on
the
ice
as
dickinson
foresaw
melvin
yielded
to
the
pressure
brought
to
bear
upon
him
and
resigned
himself
to
the
thankless
task
of
managing
the
track
team
the
election
was
held
a
week
after
thanksgiving
arousing
but
a
lukewarm
interest
with
fine
ice
on
the
river
and
the
christmas
holidays
close
at
hand
few
had
more
than
a
thought
for
the
distant
spring
even
the
problems
of
the
baseball
season
were
as
yet
but
lightly
mentioned
there
was
a
general
optimism
in
the
air
that
year
at
seaton
which
carried
everything
before
it
like
the
high
tides
of
confidence
which
sometimes
sweep
over
the
it
made
little
difference
who
were
captains
or
managers
this
was
seaton
s
year
the
teams
were
bound
to
win
only
a
few
of
the
wiser
not
all
the
captains
and
managers
fully
the
danger
of
such
a
mood
if
the
task
of
athletic
manager
proved
to
melvin
for
the
time
being
a
sinecure
another
office
which
was
suddenly
thrust
upon
him
was
quite
the
opposite
no
one
knew
exactly
how
the
hockey
rivalry
started
or
who
were
the
first
to
fan
it
into
flame
it
was
just
the
kind
of
contest
most
likely
to
arise
where
boys
gather
from
every
part
of
the
country
each
loyal
to
his
home
and
state
and
each
ready
to
boast
superiority
and
defend
the
boast
with
tongue
and
muscle
dick
had
hardly
been
twice
on
the
ice
when
the
hockey
players
began
to
pair
off
into
new
england
and
western
teams
by
some
natural
agreement
the
hudson
river
was
made
the
boundary
line
rather
unfair
division
as
it
afterwards
proved
for
the
new
englanders
included
considerably
more
than
half
the
skaters
at
first
the
rivalry
was
general
and
unorganized
then
teams
were
more
carefully
picked
and
finally
as
the
victory
wavered
from
east
to
west
in
these
miscellaneous
engagements
and
enthusiasm
and
pugnacious
patriotism
spread
the
school
was
sifted
for
experts
champion
teams
were
chosen
and
a
day
set
for
a
single
decisive
contest
it
was
then
that
dick
found
to
his
surprise
that
he
was
appointed
captain
of
the
western
team
sands
the
captain
of
the
school
nine
who
lived
in
chicago
brought
him
the
news
how
absurd
cried
dick
aghast
why
i
m
no
hockey
player
there
must
be
a
dozen
fellows
better
than
they
think
you
ll
be
the
best
leader
anyway
returned
sands
and
as
there
s
no
one
else
eligible
whom
the
fellows
will
follow
you
ll
just
have
to
take
it
when
a
man
handles
a
football
as
you
did
last
fall
he
s
supposed
to
be
capable
of
anything
don
t
try
for
the
nine
please
you
can
t
play
ball
on
a
reputation
and
i
should
hate
to
have
to
fire
you
from
the
sands
threw
himself
on
the
sofa
and
waited
for
an
answer
there
s
no
danger
of
that
replied
melvin
unruffled
i
don
t
play
ball
as
for
the
hockey
business
i
m
quite
willing
to
act
as
leader
if
it
s
understood
that
i
make
no
pretensions
to
being
a
he
pondered
a
moment
and
then
went
on
what
material
is
there
curtis
and
toddy
don
t
live
in
new
england
that
gives
us
four
solid
men
for
a
you
re
out
there
sands
answered
gloomily
curtis
lives
in
new
york
and
todd
in
brooklyn
and
both
are
east
of
the
melvin
looked
serious
then
they
ll
be
on
the
other
side
i
don
t
like
that
i
ve
stood
side
by
side
with
john
curtis
in
so
many
hard
fights
that
it
seems
like
treachery
to
play
against
him
i
really
don
t
want
to
do
sands
laughed
that
s
you
all
over
you
tackle
everything
big
and
little
in
deadly
earnest
as
if
you
were
fighting
the
battle
of
gettysburg
all
by
yourself
this
isn
t
a
hillbury
game
it
s
a
kind
of
oh
yes
i
know
all
about
that
kind
of
a
lark
when
you
begin
it
s
a
joke
before
you
re
through
it
s
a
fight
for
what
do
you
think
of
my
case
replied
sands
i
have
one
brother
in
yale
and
another
in
harvard
and
both
on
the
i
ve
heard
of
them
said
melvin
how
do
they
contrive
to
avoid
scrapping
they
never
discuss
college
matters
at
all
when
i
m
with
one
he
urges
me
to
go
to
yale
when
the
other
gets
hold
of
me
he
talks
harvard
when
we
are
all
together
they
cut
the
dick
still
meditated
sands
tried
another
tack
the
new
englanders
are
talking
big
curtis
says
the
greasers
will
wish
they
d
stayed
on
the
plains
when
his
team
s
through
with
did
he
really
say
that
asked
dick
straightening
up
he
did
and
toddy
told
marks
the
yanks
would
clean
us
off
the
ice
so
quickly
you
d
think
they
d
used
he
must
consider
us
either
sandless
or
mighty
green
said
dick
and
he
s
more
than
half
right
too
replied
sands
as
far
as
the
greenness
is
concerned
it
s
one
thing
to
play
with
a
mob
in
the
way
and
quite
another
to
run
a
regular
team
of
seven
with
complicated
rules
and
lifts
and
shoots
and
body
checks
and
passes
and
and
play
and
all
the
tricks
of
the
new
i
don
t
believe
he
ll
find
us
as
simple
as
we
look
replied
melvin
as
he
opened
a
drawer
and
took
out
a
sheet
of
paper
i
ll
take
the
captaincy
provisionally
at
any
rate
and
we
ll
call
out
candidates
this
very
afternoon
i
ll
post
the
notice
as
soon
as
i
can
write
it
see
all
the
fellows
you
can
tell
them
the
yanks
are
crowing
and
we
ll
have
a
big
push
and
lots
of
zeal
do
you
know
any
hockey
experts
on
our
side
of
the
river
the
only
crack
i
ve
heard
of
is
a
fellow
named
bosworth
but
he
s
on
the
other
i
m
glad
of
it
said
melvin
i
don
t
like
in
answer
to
the
captain
s
call
a
score
of
enthusiasts
gathered
on
the
upper
river
varrell
was
among
them
and
sands
and
burnett
and
several
heavy
men
who
seemed
promising
for
forwards
and
a
little
wiry
fellow
from
minneapolis
named
durand
whom
dick
immediately
picked
out
as
likely
to
prove
a
steady
player
on
the
second
team
the
first
task
was
to
find
who
were
well
used
to
the
game
and
who
needed
special
instruction
the
second
to
set
the
experienced
to
coach
the
inexperienced
the
third
to
divide
the
men
into
squads
set
several
games
going
and
watch
the
work
finally
the
captain
chose
a
trial
seven
gave
the
scrub
an
extra
man
and
tried
a
half
little
durand
and
varrell
who
had
never
impressed
his
classmates
as
an
athlete
found
themselves
on
the
scrub
varrell
took
coverpoint
and
durand
put
himself
among
the
forwards
the
puck
was
faced
and
started
on
its
erratic
whimsical
journey
darting
like
a
wild
thing
back
and
forth
up
and
down
before
the
game
seemed
really
well
begun
the
circular
piece
of
rubber
came
within
varrell
s
sweep
and
clung
to
the
heel
of
his
stick
he
whirled
to
the
right
to
dodge
barnes
passed
across
to
little
durand
when
melvin
blocked
his
way
took
the
puck
again
from
durand
as
the
latter
was
stopped
in
his
turn
and
then
with
a
swing
and
a
snap
shot
it
hard
at
the
posts
the
brought
his
feet
together
as
quickly
as
he
could
but
not
quite
quickly
enough
the
puck
was
already
past
him
flying
over
the
ice
like
a
swallow
skimming
the
ground
centre
again
cried
melvin
surprised
and
vexed
at
the
ease
with
which
the
thing
was
done
brace
up
sands
he
called
encouragingly
to
the
accidents
will
happen
they
won
t
do
it
the
first
forwards
did
better
for
a
time
driving
the
puck
down
by
sheer
force
through
the
intimidated
second
defence
twice
they
shot
for
goal
and
missed
and
then
varrell
got
a
chance
again
and
with
a
kind
of
scoop
with
stick
directly
in
front
lifted
the
puck
in
a
long
beautiful
arch
twenty
feet
high
to
the
farther
end
sands
sent
it
back
again
with
almost
as
good
a
lift
a
lucky
second
stopped
it
passed
it
to
varrell
who
nursed
it
along
in
a
strange
wabbling
course
and
delivered
it
safely
to
durand
the
latter
swept
ahead
in
turn
and
then
while
melvin
was
wondering
in
what
direction
durand
was
going
to
wheel
varrell
took
the
puck
again
and
shot
a
beautiful
goal
right
under
the
captain
s
own
nose
sands
and
melvin
and
varrell
trudged
back
to
recitation
together
where
did
you
learn
to
play
asked
sands
you
handle
a
stick
like
a
i
spent
last
year
at
a
canadian
answered
varrell
there
was
good
ice
for
months
and
hockey
was
about
the
only
game
we
you
and
durand
played
the
whole
game
for
the
second
what
a
squirmer
the
little
rascal
is
he
doesn
t
weigh
more
than
a
hundred
and
ten
and
yet
you
can
t
knock
him
over
to
save
he
checks
low
said
dick
and
is
firm
on
his
feet
but
he
s
awfully
light
i
doubt
if
he
has
much
staying
i
think
you
re
wrong
said
varrell
i
ve
seen
that
kind
before
they
never
get
in
the
next
day
s
practice
varrell
and
durand
being
on
the
scrub
the
score
at
the
end
of
the
first
half
was
even
in
the
second
half
the
two
men
played
with
the
first
team
and
the
scrub
defence
was
kept
so
busy
that
the
game
seemed
to
centre
around
their
and
melvin
had
finally
to
transfer
sands
to
the
other
side
to
give
him
a
share
in
the
practice
to
furnish
some
test
of
endurance
the
length
of
the
half
was
doubled
when
time
was
called
durand
was
bobbing
and
twisting
and
checking
and
shooting
as
busily
as
ever
while
one
of
the
big
forwards
was
obviously
fagged
and
melvin
himself
felt
that
his
ankles
were
rebelling
at
the
unusual
strain
that
settled
the
question
of
the
team
varrell
and
durand
had
earned
their
places
upon
it
two
or
three
days
later
a
meeting
of
the
team
was
held
to
receive
melvin
s
resignation
i
ve
got
the
team
together
he
said
and
with
that
my
duty
is
done
the
best
captain
for
us
now
is
the
man
who
knows
most
hockey
and
can
teach
us
the
most
i
m
not
that
the
players
at
first
expostulated
then
finding
that
melvin
was
in
earnest
very
sensibly
did
what
they
knew
he
wanted
them
to
do
varrell
captain
i
think
it
s
a
mistake
said
sands
to
barnes
as
they
came
down
the
dormitory
stairs
nobody
knows
varrell
but
there
s
no
use
arguing
with
melvin
about
a
thing
of
this
kind
he
s
one
of
those
obstinately
honest
fellows
who
stand
up
so
straight
that
they
fall
you
dropped
the
greaser
captaincy
like
a
hot
shot
quoth
john
curtis
on
the
way
out
from
chapel
as
he
grabbed
melvin
by
the
coat
collar
with
the
familiarity
of
an
old
crony
and
grinned
in
his
face
knew
you
were
going
to
get
licked
didn
t
you
you
re
a
foxy
dick
looked
up
and
caught
a
fleeting
troubled
look
on
the
face
of
varrell
who
stood
eying
them
intently
some
distance
away
i
wasn
t
good
enough
he
said
aloud
as
if
varrell
could
hear
him
on
a
team
like
ours
i
m
content
to
fight
in
the
as
john
did
not
understand
this
he
merely
uttered
an
incredulous
oho
and
giving
his
classmate
a
slap
on
the
shoulder
to
convey
the
impression
that
he
was
not
to
be
fooled
went
outside
to
consider
the
answer
more
fully
and
wonder
if
the
greasers
were
really
trying
to
spring
some
new
trick
upon
the
yanks
melvin
swung
into
the
greek
room
and
opened
his
homer
with
a
chuckle
of
pride
that
would
pass
for
a
delphic
response
he
doesn
t
know
what
i
meant
and
he
won
t
know
until
the
game
he
added
with
the
old
determined
look
coming
back
into
his
face
chapter
iii
the
battle
varrell
took
to
the
management
of
the
team
with
a
quietness
and
assurance
that
put
hope
into
the
hearts
of
the
small
but
determined
band
which
represented
the
great
west
the
few
days
that
were
left
for
practice
were
used
to
the
utmost
in
the
morning
the
captain
found
time
to
show
individual
players
about
shooting
and
lifting
and
stopping
shots
in
the
afternoon
he
drilled
the
team
in
passing
and
dodging
and
checking
there
was
a
little
murmuring
when
a
big
forward
was
taken
out
of
the
game
because
he
was
uncertain
on
his
skates
and
more
still
when
another
was
relegated
to
the
list
of
substitutes
for
playing
his
own
game
instead
of
fitting
into
the
scheme
for
team
work
but
varrell
s
answer
was
conclusive
our
only
chance
to
win
is
by
team
play
we
have
no
stars
and
on
their
team
are
two
or
three
men
who
have
played
in
the
best
city
rinks
united
we
win
scattered
we
the
murmurers
said
no
more
that
last
saturday
before
the
christmas
holidays
was
clear
and
cold
the
course
had
been
chosen
on
the
river
where
high
banks
ran
nearly
parallel
twenty
yards
apart
the
snow
which
had
been
cleared
away
the
day
before
was
piled
up
behind
the
forming
end
barriers
sixty
yards
from
each
other
and
completing
with
the
river
banks
a
natural
enclosure
of
about
the
regular
rink
size
illustration
the
western
contingent
were
established
among
the
pines
on
the
on
the
banks
gathered
the
patriotic
factions
new
englanders
in
the
open
field
on
the
left
swaggering
merrily
about
their
fires
and
hurling
derisive
cheers
across
the
ice
to
the
western
contingent
who
were
established
among
the
pines
on
the
right
this
latter
band
of
supporters
though
weaker
in
numbers
had
from
their
position
a
certain
advantage
which
they
made
the
most
of
they
swarmed
into
the
trees
with
impromptu
banners
when
they
were
they
devised
an
unintelligible
chant
which
made
up
for
lack
of
voices
and
finally
tompkins
of
montana
developed
a
weird
penetrating
yell
something
between
a
whoop
and
a
scream
which
no
one
on
the
opposite
bank
could
imitate
or
match
and
which
he
uttered
at
impressive
intervals
from
the
upper
branches
of
the
tallest
pine
yet
with
all
this
show
of
patriotism
the
noisy
rivalry
seemed
quite
free
from
bitterness
the
gibes
flew
back
and
forth
there
were
cheers
and
counter
cheers
and
chants
and
montana
hoots
from
the
pine
tree
but
the
mood
was
of
frolic
not
of
fight
for
the
spectators
it
was
a
lark
pure
and
simple
hardly
any
one
really
cared
at
the
outset
what
the
result
was
to
be
on
the
ice
the
spirit
was
different
dick
looked
into
john
curtis
s
face
and
behind
the
patronizing
grin
read
very
clearly
a
poorly
masked
defiance
todd
the
yank
forward
end
fingered
his
stick
nervously
over
the
ice
as
he
waited
for
the
call
to
places
and
on
his
cheeks
appeared
the
telltale
white
spots
which
dick
had
seen
before
in
the
great
football
games
when
toddy
had
set
his
teeth
and
fought
for
ground
by
the
inch
bosworth
the
yank
coverpoint
leaned
scowling
on
his
stick
eying
his
opponents
with
sombre
malevolence
they
are
fighters
not
players
said
dick
to
himself
disapprovingly
they
seem
to
think
they
re
out
against
and
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
his
own
men
looked
equally
fierce
and
determined
sands
stood
ready
at
goal
but
he
had
not
a
word
for
the
boy
who
was
beside
him
waiting
to
take
his
sweater
when
the
game
was
called
varrell
was
moving
about
with
the
quiet
confidence
of
a
master
which
is
more
impressive
to
an
opponent
than
noisy
display
and
as
for
melvin
himself
one
did
not
need
to
be
told
that
his
whole
heart
was
in
the
contest
the
school
knew
well
that
what
melvin
did
he
did
with
all
his
might
a
stranger
would
have
read
determination
in
the
open
face
little
durand
was
about
the
only
one
of
the
fourteen
who
seemed
to
share
the
mood
of
the
spectators
he
flourished
and
circled
about
chattering
gayly
up
to
the
very
moment
of
beginning
the
preliminaries
were
soon
arranged
ready
called
the
captains
and
a
moment
later
at
the
first
sound
of
the
referee
s
whistle
the
two
forwards
were
scraping
and
twisting
to
secure
the
puck
on
the
curtis
got
it
or
thought
he
had
but
before
he
could
really
call
it
his
a
greaser
blocked
his
play
and
durand
dexterously
picking
out
the
puck
swept
it
across
to
rawle
who
dribbled
it
along
passed
back
to
durand
received
it
again
and
lost
it
in
the
crush
at
the
yank
goal
in
another
moment
it
came
flying
through
the
air
on
a
lift
far
down
in
the
greaser
defence
field
dick
succeeded
in
stopping
it
and
sending
it
on
toward
varrell
the
greaser
captain
was
but
he
allowed
his
opponent
just
to
touch
the
puck
and
then
with
a
sudden
swing
to
one
side
he
was
off
down
the
ice
sweeping
the
puck
with
him
the
first
opponent
he
dodged
big
curtis
who
was
next
in
order
made
him
pass
but
the
exchange
gave
him
the
puck
again
and
after
several
quick
diagonal
passes
with
durand
that
brought
them
near
the
yank
goal
varrell
gave
his
stick
a
sudden
hard
flourish
and
the
puck
shot
like
an
arrow
between
the
grazing
the
s
knee
as
it
passed
it
was
all
done
so
quickly
so
unexpectedly
that
for
a
moment
the
western
supporters
under
the
pines
and
in
the
pines
seemed
unaware
that
their
team
had
scored
then
as
the
sticks
of
the
team
brandished
in
air
made
the
fact
clear
a
confused
mixture
of
cheers
screeches
whoops
and
catcalls
gave
proof
that
the
west
was
both
patriotic
and
appreciative
on
the
new
england
side
indifference
seemed
to
prevail
one
said
sands
with
joy
as
the
puck
came
back
to
the
centre
the
first
one
you
mean
returned
dick
in
a
low
tone
we
re
not
through
the
next
goal
came
hard
the
eastern
team
was
heavier
and
generally
stronger
but
the
members
could
not
or
would
not
play
together
and
if
they
got
the
puck
down
near
the
greaser
goal
they
usually
lost
it
before
the
goal
was
really
threatened
once
a
hard
shot
close
at
hand
struck
sands
in
the
pit
of
the
stomach
and
the
spectators
cheered
and
jeered
as
the
gasping
lad
feebly
lifted
the
puck
away
from
its
dangerous
proximity
to
the
goal
he
had
his
breath
again
in
a
moment
however
apparently
none
the
worse
for
his
experience
soon
after
curtis
and
durand
came
together
as
both
rushed
for
the
puck
at
the
same
time
and
the
spectators
under
the
trees
cheered
wildly
as
the
little
fellow
crouched
low
for
the
collision
and
the
big
football
player
sprawled
over
him
upon
the
ice
but
varrell
was
the
objective
point
of
the
strongest
attack
though
he
played
coverpoint
he
had
an
arrangement
with
brown
one
of
the
forwards
to
exchange
places
on
signal
and
the
result
was
that
he
appeared
now
in
the
defence
now
in
the
attack
apparently
scenting
the
course
the
puck
was
destined
to
take
and
always
equal
to
the
need
the
yanks
grew
rougher
and
more
violent
todd
took
to
body
checking
where
it
was
not
necessary
bosworth
when
a
greaser
got
the
puck
away
from
him
followed
on
at
his
heels
with
malice
and
banged
away
viciously
at
the
unlucky
man
s
shins
even
though
it
was
apparent
that
the
puck
was
wholly
beyond
the
pursuer
s
reach
such
tactics
unless
checked
are
usually
the
prelude
to
rougher
play
and
dick
for
this
reason
was
doubly
grateful
when
from
the
edge
of
the
mêlée
around
the
yank
rawle
swiped
the
puck
through
a
second
time
play
had
hardly
been
resumed
when
the
referee
s
whistle
announced
the
end
of
the
first
half
as
was
to
be
expected
the
jubilation
under
the
pines
was
earnest
and
loud
in
the
opposite
camp
where
the
neglected
fires
were
dying
away
in
smoke
quite
different
conditions
prevailed
a
few
with
heroic
repression
of
natural
sympathy
still
pretended
to
regard
the
whole
matter
as
a
joke
in
which
victory
or
defeat
meant
little
or
nothing
the
great
majority
however
unable
to
rise
to
this
level
were
distinctly
conscious
of
having
in
some
way
been
cheated
they
had
come
out
to
be
amused
and
part
of
the
amusement
was
to
consist
in
seeing
the
impudent
greasers
given
a
sound
beating
and
here
were
their
men
including
such
big
husky
athletes
as
curtis
and
todd
and
fellows
who
had
been
glorified
as
city
rink
experts
like
bosworth
and
richmond
overthrown
by
a
set
of
amateurs
rotten
said
marks
the
connoisseur
of
sports
as
he
interviewed
curtis
and
todd
during
the
intermission
perfectly
rotten
did
you
get
us
up
here
to
fool
us
i
didn
t
ask
you
to
come
returned
curtis
trying
to
keep
his
good
nature
if
you
can
do
much
better
come
out
oh
i
m
no
athlete
rejoined
marks
hastily
but
i
can
see
what
the
fault
is
better
than
you
do
that
varrell
plays
most
of
their
game
you
ve
got
to
use
him
up
give
them
a
rougher
game
push
em
hard
when
two
of
you
start
for
the
puck
let
the
puck
go
where
it
pleases
just
smash
at
the
man
when
the
man
s
out
of
the
way
you
can
take
your
time
about
the
puck
you
re
heavy
and
have
the
that
seems
rather
mean
said
curtis
mean
exclaimed
marks
did
you
ask
a
hillbury
man
to
excuse
you
when
you
tackled
him
on
the
football
field
i
guess
curtis
glanced
around
the
group
and
read
the
looks
of
approval
well
then
he
said
finally
make
it
rough
but
let
s
have
fair
play
eye
rested
on
bosworth
as
he
said
this
and
no
low
tricks
everything
must
be
straight
and
when
the
game
began
again
the
new
spirit
was
immediately
apparent
the
yanks
got
the
puck
and
tried
to
drive
it
down
by
weight
but
the
rule
checked
them
durand
still
stole
the
puck
from
behind
their
sticks
and
put
his
shoulder
so
low
that
he
could
not
be
overturned
while
varrell
still
hovered
on
the
edge
of
the
scrimmage
and
drew
the
puck
as
a
magnet
draws
a
scrap
of
iron
despite
the
heavy
body
checking
the
play
lingered
about
the
yank
goal
for
the
yank
forwards
did
not
follow
the
puck
back
closely
on
the
defence
and
melvin
or
sands
soon
sent
it
into
yank
territory
again
rawle
tried
for
goal
and
failed
durand
missed
in
his
turn
and
then
varrell
got
the
puck
thirty
yards
away
and
while
his
opponents
were
watching
for
a
pass
by
a
long
beautiful
shoot
made
the
third
score
for
his
side
and
now
the
yanks
patience
gave
out
rules
or
no
rules
they
were
determined
that
their
opponents
should
make
no
more
goals
again
varrell
took
the
puck
and
with
his
familiar
tricky
movement
of
the
wrist
started
down
the
ice
look
out
for
bosworth
yelled
durand
whom
todd
was
obstructing
at
the
but
varrell
s
dull
ears
served
him
bosworth
who
was
close
at
the
greaser
s
heels
thrust
his
stick
suddenly
between
varrell
s
rapidly
moving
legs
and
threw
him
with
a
crash
to
the
ice
right
under
the
feet
of
richmond
who
was
speeding
up
from
another
direction
richmond
went
down
too
tripping
hard
against
the
prostrate
form
the
greasers
hissed
the
yankees
groaned
john
curtis
be
it
said
to
his
credit
ordered
bosworth
from
the
ice
before
the
referee
could
interfere
but
the
advantage
of
the
accident
as
bosworth
called
it
was
on
the
side
of
the
yankees
varrell
was
helped
off
the
scene
barely
able
to
lift
his
leg
the
teams
went
on
with
six
men
each
with
varrell
the
greasers
had
lost
the
mainspring
of
their
attack
superior
weight
and
superior
physical
strength
began
to
tell
the
puck
kept
returning
to
the
greaser
defence
then
came
a
scrimmage
before
the
goal
a
quick
shoot
from
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
and
the
yanks
were
exulting
over
their
first
score
only
four
minutes
more
pleaded
dick
skating
down
the
greaser
line
hold
them
that
long
for
varrell
s
sake
we
can
do
it
if
we
and
the
weary
six
rallied
once
more
durand
was
knocked
about
like
the
puck
itself
but
he
stuck
gamily
to
his
work
and
zigzagged
and
circled
and
dodged
as
before
sands
saved
one
goal
with
his
hands
another
with
his
feet
dick
met
body
check
with
body
check
and
lifted
high
and
sure
but
never
before
had
he
listened
so
anxiously
for
the
sound
of
the
referee
s
whistle
when
it
came
and
he
knew
certainly
that
the
game
was
won
he
flung
his
stick
into
the
air
and
led
the
gathering
greasers
in
a
long
hearty
cheer
for
varrell
who
lying
on
the
meadow
bank
bedded
in
yank
blankets
was
watching
the
result
with
his
heart
in
his
mouth
great
work
you
did
this
afternoon
said
tompkins
two
hours
later
popping
his
head
into
melvin
s
room
any
part
of
you
that
isn
t
black
and
blue
i
didn
t
suffer
much
replied
melvin
it
wasn
t
as
bad
as
it
i
hope
not
said
tompkins
do
you
know
what
battle
in
roman
history
the
fray
reminded
me
of
dick
shook
his
head
i
don
t
know
any
history
i
passed
it
off
last
the
battle
of
the
ostrogoths
and
visigoths
replied
tompkins
wisely
it
s
a
case
of
history
repeating
itself
the
visigoths
won
both
and
then
he
added
i
don
t
believe
the
goths
would
have
been
guilty
of
some
of
the
things
i
saw
done
on
the
ice
this
chapter
iv
phil
s
resolution
the
christmas
holidays
were
over
varrell
limped
no
more
and
dickinson
who
had
long
since
discarded
his
cane
walked
with
quick
elastic
step
as
of
old
apparently
completely
recovered
a
few
new
boys
had
entered
school
one
of
these
who
was
somewhat
rough
in
appearance
and
who
struggled
clumsily
with
the
lessons
of
a
lower
class
was
said
to
be
a
pitcher
he
was
older
than
most
of
the
students
in
years
rather
a
man
than
a
boy
this
fact
was
not
in
itself
remarkable
for
there
is
no
age
limit
at
seaton
and
many
an
honest
earnest
fellow
who
after
his
twentieth
year
has
conceived
a
longing
for
an
education
has
found
opportunity
and
encouragement
there
but
flanahan
seemed
not
entirely
of
this
class
what
about
him
sands
asked
dick
he
looks
suspicious
what
do
you
mean
by
that
demanded
the
captain
he
isn
t
the
youngest
fellow
in
school
of
course
but
he
isn
t
the
oldest
either
why
shouldn
t
he
have
a
chance
for
an
education
as
well
as
any
one
else
he
should
if
he
really
wants
it
replied
melvin
he
looks
as
if
he
had
knocked
around
on
a
good
many
diamonds
before
coming
do
you
mean
that
he
s
a
professional
yes
something
of
that
kind
would
hit
it
better
i
if
he
s
a
professional
i
don
t
know
it
said
sands
i
didn
t
get
him
here
he
says
he
s
an
amateur
and
he
has
certainly
played
on
some
good
amateur
nines
he
can
pitch
and
we
need
a
pitcher
that
s
all
i
know
about
and
all
you
want
to
know
said
melvin
with
a
smile
yes
all
i
want
to
know
repeated
sands
melvin
passed
to
another
topic
phil
would
like
to
try
for
the
nine
is
there
any
chance
for
him
none
at
all
replied
sands
promptly
that
s
a
fine
way
to
choose
a
team
retorted
melvin
you
haven
t
tried
him
and
yet
you
say
he
has
no
show
we
searched
high
and
low
for
football
material
scoured
the
school
and
here
you
are
deciding
offhand
against
a
fellow
whose
playing
you
ve
never
seen
no
wonder
the
nine
gets
sands
s
face
reddened
i
didn
t
say
i
wouldn
t
try
him
i
ll
try
anything
that
offers
i
only
said
that
he
hadn
t
any
have
you
seen
him
play
yes
he
can
throw
pretty
well
and
field
fairly
but
he
isn
t
old
enough
or
big
enough
or
strong
enough
or
experienced
enough
for
the
school
well
he
ll
grow
won
t
he
persisted
dick
just
give
him
a
chance
to
work
i
ll
give
him
just
the
chance
i
give
any
one
else
and
no
more
replied
sands
decisively
every
man
who
makes
the
nine
this
year
has
got
to
earn
his
place
and
the
fact
that
phil
is
your
chum
and
a
friend
of
mine
will
simply
make
me
harder
on
him
when
i
say
he
hasn
t
a
chance
i
mean
that
he
can
not
meet
the
standard
he
may
try
as
hard
as
he
wants
they
separated
at
the
gymnasium
door
each
going
to
his
own
part
of
the
locker
rooms
to
dress
a
few
minutes
later
as
dick
was
running
upstairs
to
his
regular
gymnasium
work
he
caught
the
sound
of
sands
s
voice
exhorting
the
squad
in
the
baseball
cage
he
paused
a
moment
with
a
smile
of
approval
on
his
lips
as
he
marked
the
steady
confident
tones
and
recalled
the
captain
s
sturdy
resolve
to
hold
to
the
merit
system
in
choosing
the
nine
then
flanahan
s
lanky
figure
loomed
up
by
the
doorway
and
the
smile
on
melvin
s
face
died
suddenly
away
he
turned
abruptly
and
went
on
his
way
upstairs
phil
said
melvin
that
night
as
the
junior
came
in
after
supper
should
you
really
like
to
try
for
the
nine
should
i
the
boy
s
eyes
sparkled
if
i
had
the
ghost
of
a
chance
of
being
kept
on
the
squad
till
we
got
outdoors
i
d
say
yes
right
what
can
you
play
best
asked
melvin
i
ve
always
played
in
the
poole
replied
rather
humbly
i
m
fairly
safe
on
flies
and
could
always
throw
a
little
farther
and
a
little
straighter
than
the
other
an
must
be
a
good
hitter
or
they
won
t
keep
him
can
you
bat
they
used
to
say
i
had
a
good
eye
returned
phil
who
was
not
used
to
singing
his
own
praises
i
m
not
heavy
enough
for
long
if
you
re
sure
on
the
elements
go
in
and
try
said
melvin
but
you
must
do
your
level
best
the
only
way
for
you
to
accomplish
anything
is
just
to
devote
your
whole
thought
and
attention
out
of
study
hours
to
baseball
and
nothing
but
baseball
do
everything
you
re
told
to
do
and
more
study
yourself
all
the
time
get
help
outside
that
the
others
haven
t
hang
to
the
squad
till
they
kick
you
off
and
when
that
happens
organize
a
nine
of
your
own
and
keep
up
your
practice
if
they
call
you
a
fool
and
a
crank
just
laugh
and
keep
on
playing
are
you
willing
to
do
all
that
the
color
deepened
on
phil
s
cheeks
as
he
listened
i
ll
do
more
than
that
he
cried
i
ll
shack
balls
i
ll
tend
the
bats
i
ll
carry
water
i
ll
do
anything
they
put
upon
me
i
ll
try
this
year
and
next
and
the
year
after
but
if
there
s
any
baseball
in
me
i
ll
make
the
nine
before
i
leave
good
exclaimed
the
senior
giving
the
boy
s
hand
a
squeeze
that
made
the
bones
crack
i
don
t
know
much
about
baseball
but
that
s
the
spirit
that
wins
only
don
t
talk
about
what
you
re
going
to
do
think
a
lot
but
keep
your
thoughts
to
yourself
when
you
play
play
with
all
your
they
settled
down
to
the
work
of
the
evening
occasionally
dick
glanced
with
interest
across
the
table
to
see
whether
the
hated
virgil
lesson
or
the
excitement
of
the
new
resolution
was
to
possess
phil
s
thoughts
for
a
time
the
lad
with
face
still
flushed
gazed
vacantly
up
toward
the
picture
moulding
then
with
a
start
and
a
slam
he
opened
his
æneid
at
the
fourth
book
and
ground
away
for
two
steady
patient
hours
at
the
lovelorn
wails
of
the
unhappy
dido
in
whose
fate
he
had
about
as
much
sympathetic
interest
as
a
horse
on
a
coal
wagon
feels
for
the
sufferings
of
the
freezing
poor
i
ll
bet
on
him
in
the
long
run
thought
dick
as
he
eyed
the
determined
plodder
the
next
day
philip
poole
s
name
appeared
on
the
list
of
candidates
for
the
nine
chapter
v
a
tough
problem
melvin
and
varrell
returned
from
their
greek
recitation
together
i
don
t
like
the
way
things
are
going
this
year
melvin
was
saying
there
s
too
much
confidence
if
the
track
team
wins
it
will
be
just
as
expected
with
no
credit
to
any
one
if
we
lose
woe
to
captain
and
you
re
right
said
varrell
but
forewarned
is
forearmed
keep
cool
and
reasonable
and
see
to
it
that
you
don
t
if
it
weren
t
for
dickinson
went
on
melvin
i
shouldn
t
have
taken
the
thing
at
all
you
see
i
feel
a
kind
of
responsibility
toward
him
because
of
the
way
in
which
i
got
him
to
run
last
year
so
i
didn
t
like
to
refuse
you
know
i
wasn
t
here
last
year
said
varrell
why
of
course
i
keep
forgetting
that
you
came
this
fall
it
happened
this
way
martin
discovered
dickinson
ve
heard
of
martin
haven
t
you
of
last
year
s
senior
class
varrell
nodded
martin
discovered
that
dickinson
could
run
and
curtis
and
i
got
him
out
for
the
sports
in
the
spring
and
stood
sponsors
for
him
until
he
had
courage
enough
to
stand
won
everything
last
year
didn
t
he
asked
varrell
quarter
and
hands
down
answered
melvin
but
there
s
no
surety
that
he
ll
do
it
again
besides
no
one
can
say
yet
what
the
effect
of
that
ankle
will
be
the
doctor
thinks
it
will
be
as
strong
as
ever
but
i
know
a
sprained
ankle
is
very
easy
to
sprain
again
without
dickinson
we
shouldn
t
have
much
to
brag
both
boys
turned
to
their
work
melvin
in
the
quiet
way
with
which
he
had
learned
to
attack
his
lessons
opened
his
trigonometry
on
the
desk
and
in
a
moment
was
oblivious
to
all
else
but
the
problem
which
was
first
to
be
solved
varrell
s
stint
was
of
a
different
kind
lines
of
macbeth
to
be
committed
to
memory
before
twelve
o
clock
as
this
involved
much
repetition
and
possible
interference
with
the
trigonometry
problem
he
retired
to
the
bedroom
where
he
could
mutter
at
his
ease
they
possessed
two
very
different
personalities
varrell
was
tall
and
slight
his
limbs
hardly
filled
out
to
their
proper
roundness
with
a
intelligent
face
and
striking
gray
eyes
that
were
remarkable
not
so
much
for
what
they
showed
of
the
character
behind
them
as
for
the
power
of
sight
which
they
seemed
to
possess
ever
alert
and
observant
even
when
his
face
was
otherwise
at
rest
the
eyes
seemed
the
aggressive
part
of
the
boy
their
direct
glance
was
like
a
ray
of
concentrated
intelligence
i
like
varrell
said
tompkins
one
day
in
a
burst
of
confidence
except
when
he
looks
at
me
hard
and
then
his
eyes
cut
right
through
me
and
i
feel
as
if
he
were
counting
the
hairs
on
the
back
of
my
melvin
was
more
substantially
built
as
he
sat
at
the
table
the
cloth
of
his
coat
sleeves
drew
tight
over
the
splendid
deltoid
and
biceps
and
his
square
blunt
knees
showed
hardened
muscles
rounding
out
beyond
the
if
his
face
lacked
the
alertness
of
look
so
noticeable
in
varrell
it
yet
had
a
composure
and
an
air
of
and
honesty
that
rendered
it
no
less
attractive
the
learner
of
shakespeare
was
restless
the
first
five
lines
were
mastered
in
a
chair
by
the
window
the
next
five
on
melvin
s
bed
the
third
on
poole
s
bed
and
the
fourth
on
a
second
chair
in
the
circuit
of
the
room
he
had
learned
twenty
lines
another
lap
and
i
shall
have
it
he
said
to
himself
gleefully
as
he
took
his
place
again
by
the
window
the
outside
door
opened
and
poole
came
rushing
into
the
study
i
want
to
tell
you
something
dick
and
i
ve
just
three
minutes
before
latin
to
tell
it
hat
is
that
varrell
s
said
dick
who
had
risen
from
the
desk
he
s
in
the
bedroom
plugging
away
at
hello
varrell
said
phil
looking
in
at
the
door
shakespeare
plays
havoc
with
the
beds
doesn
t
he
get
out
cried
varrell
waving
him
off
you
rattle
phil
joined
dick
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
through
the
open
door
they
could
see
the
shakespearean
scholar
doggedly
muttering
over
his
book
shan
t
we
disturb
him
asked
phil
hesitating
speak
low
and
there
ll
be
no
danger
said
melvin
his
ears
aren
t
the
eleven
o
clock
bell
soon
broke
in
on
the
conversation
and
sent
the
younger
boy
flying
to
his
recitation
dick
sat
down
at
the
desk
again
and
tried
to
take
up
his
work
where
he
had
left
it
but
he
was
apparently
in
a
very
unstudious
mood
his
pencil
no
longer
moved
steadily
over
the
paper
his
gaze
rested
fitfully
now
here
now
there
on
the
various
objects
before
him
his
flushed
sober
face
showed
that
his
thoughts
were
hot
within
him
finally
he
threw
down
his
pencil
in
disgust
and
sauntering
over
to
the
window
leaned
his
head
against
the
sash
and
gazed
moodily
out
he
s
a
confounded
rascal
exclaimed
varrell
who
had
been
eying
his
agitated
comrade
over
the
shakespeare
but
it
s
no
fault
of
yours
and
why
do
you
bother
yourself
about
him
who
said
dick
staring
at
him
in
amazement
why
bosworth
of
course
went
on
varrell
coolly
if
what
phil
says
of
him
is
true
he
s
even
a
bigger
rascal
than
i
always
thought
dick
was
nonplussed
his
conversation
with
phil
had
certainly
been
carried
on
in
a
tone
too
low
to
be
audible
to
varrell
in
the
bedroom
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
sharply
why
that
he
has
been
getting
some
of
those
little
fellows
into
his
room
to
play
poker
and
fleecing
them
especially
that
boy
with
a
short
name
with
a
t
or
a
d
in
yes
eddy
replied
dick
he
s
in
phil
s
and
then
looking
curiously
at
his
friend
he
added
your
hearing
is
growing
surprisingly
good
i
must
i
m
sorry
if
i
overheard
what
you
meant
i
should
not
know
said
varrell
flushing
if
that
is
the
case
i
shall
certainly
try
to
forget
oh
i
don
t
mind
your
knowing
it
said
dick
i
only
wish
you
could
tell
what
we
ought
to
do
about
the
clanging
bell
again
interposed
its
peremptory
summons
twelve
o
clock
cried
varrell
as
he
made
a
dash
for
his
hat
and
only
thirty
lines
i
ll
bet
i
ll
be
called
on
for
the
ten
i
didn
t
when
phil
had
time
for
longer
explanations
he
gave
dick
more
details
of
the
happenings
in
sibley
bosworth
s
room
eddy
who
had
given
the
information
was
in
phil
s
class
and
of
about
phil
s
age
smarting
under
a
sense
of
and
desperately
perplexed
as
to
how
he
was
to
account
for
the
lost
money
which
had
been
sent
him
for
purchases
for
the
winter
he
had
opened
his
heart
to
phil
who
in
turn
had
made
haste
to
unburden
himself
to
his
older
and
presumably
wiser
hardly
had
he
done
this
when
eddy
repented
of
his
confidences
and
tearfully
besought
his
classmate
never
to
speak
of
it
to
a
living
soul
but
the
murder
was
out
and
the
best
phil
could
do
was
to
urge
melvin
to
guard
the
secret
so
having
stolen
the
fellow
s
money
bosworth
has
made
him
promise
not
to
mention
the
fact
said
melvin
eddy
said
it
was
a
matter
of
honor
the
money
had
been
lost
in
fair
play
and
he
had
no
right
to
speak
of
it
when
it
might
get
them
all
into
so
bosworth
says
i
suppose
said
melvin
yes
that
s
it
bosworth
says
it
s
just
a
personal
matter
between
them
and
to
tell
about
it
so
that
it
might
reach
the
faculty
would
be
simply
what
kind
of
a
boy
is
eddy
not
very
good
and
not
especially
bad
but
just
weak
he
is
terribly
cut
up
about
the
thing
doesn
t
study
any
and
cries
a
lot
in
his
room
i
can
t
help
pitying
him
though
i
don
t
sympathize
with
him
dick
smiled
i
suppose
you
d
do
differently
in
his
phil
grew
indignant
i
rather
think
i
should
to
begin
with
i
shouldn
t
be
in
his
place
i
wouldn
t
touch
that
bosworth
with
a
pole
but
supposing
that
i
did
get
into
the
scrape
i
d
take
it
as
a
warning
to
leave
bosworth
and
gambling
alone
and
write
home
an
honest
letter
about
the
whole
and
that
s
the
very
thing
eddy
ought
to
do
said
melvin
giving
phil
s
shoulder
a
slap
why
didn
t
you
tell
him
so
i
did
replied
phil
but
he
is
afraid
to
and
he
wouldn
t
listen
at
all
to
my
idea
of
telling
graham
about
it
without
mentioning
bosworth
s
dick
grinned
graham
the
principal
of
seaton
ruled
the
school
with
a
strong
hand
his
was
not
a
mailed
fist
in
a
velvet
glove
but
a
strong
dexterous
hand
gloved
in
velvet
with
a
mail
back
the
whole
school
saw
the
steel
exterior
few
really
appreciated
the
gentleness
of
the
clasp
i
suppose
they
d
be
fired
if
it
came
out
went
on
phil
they
wouldn
t
have
time
to
say
or
at
least
bosworth
wouldn
t
i
m
not
so
certain
about
a
knock
at
the
door
was
followed
by
the
appearance
of
a
head
seeing
that
the
visitor
was
tompkins
phil
opened
his
greek
grammar
and
plunged
vigorously
into
study
as
if
he
had
no
other
interest
in
the
world
tompkins
looked
from
one
sober
face
to
the
other
then
gave
a
glance
over
phil
s
shoulder
at
the
page
of
the
open
book
metres
of
aristophanes
is
that
what
they
give
here
to
beginners
in
greek
if
it
is
i
m
glad
i
began
out
phil
shut
the
book
with
a
bang
and
replied
half
petulantly
half
amused
that
he
should
have
betrayed
himself
so
easily
no
it
isn
t
i
was
unpleasant
thoughts
said
tompkins
with
another
glance
at
melvin
s
face
well
i
guess
i
won
t
bother
you
any
more
there
was
no
reply
to
this
and
the
visitor
moved
toward
the
door
as
his
hand
touched
the
knob
a
new
thought
struck
him
and
he
turned
suddenly
on
the
boy
you
haven
t
been
losing
your
money
too
have
you
phil
was
it
the
warm
sympathy
in
the
westerner
s
tone
or
relief
at
finding
that
others
knew
the
secret
or
natural
indignation
at
an
unwarranted
suspicion
that
suddenly
put
to
flight
the
boy
s
reserve
philip
himself
could
not
have
told
what
do
you
take
me
for
he
demanded
not
on
your
life
glad
to
hear
it
your
classmate
eddy
got
bled
pretty
deep
went
on
tompkins
we
were
just
talking
about
him
said
dick
it
s
a
bad
an
easy
game
for
a
card
sharper
said
tompkins
coolly
and
a
big
piece
of
folly
by
a
little
fool
neither
the
sharper
nor
the
fool
ought
to
be
here
s
too
dangerous
and
the
other
s
too
weak
but
if
i
should
go
to
grim
and
tell
him
about
the
thing
and
let
him
do
with
the
fellow
what
he
really
ought
to
i
suppose
i
should
never
dare
to
look
a
boy
in
the
face
you
probably
wouldn
t
enjoy
life
much
in
school
afterwards
said
dick
thoughtfully
i
thought
as
much
tompkins
continued
in
the
same
tone
if
he
stole
or
murdered
we
could
complain
to
the
authorities
and
have
him
arrested
but
as
he
s
only
ruining
the
characters
of
a
few
little
boys
it
wouldn
t
be
nice
to
tell
on
him
great
thing
this
school
honor
when
you
understand
it
well
so
long
chapter
vi
a
western
solution
do
you
think
bosworth
s
still
keeping
it
up
asked
melvin
as
he
stood
before
the
fireplace
in
varrell
s
room
in
hale
a
day
or
two
later
i
am
sure
he
is
said
wrenn
you
can
look
right
across
from
this
room
to
his
windows
in
sibley
his
shades
were
down
close
all
last
evening
and
he
doesn
t
usually
lower
them
even
when
he
s
tompkins
s
conduct
is
beyond
me
said
melvin
he
seemed
as
indignant
as
any
of
us
when
the
story
came
out
but
i
ve
seen
him
twice
in
the
last
two
days
hanging
around
with
that
gambler
as
friendly
as
if
he
had
known
him
for
i
thought
tommy
was
a
pretty
decent
fellow
mused
varrell
there
s
no
counting
on
these
wild
well
what
do
you
think
questioned
dick
returning
to
the
matter
that
had
brought
him
over
to
hale
are
we
bound
to
sit
quietly
and
see
bosworth
play
his
faro
tricks
on
these
little
fellows
the
next
step
will
be
to
get
them
all
in
debt
to
him
and
then
he
can
keep
bleeding
them
as
they
have
money
by
promising
them
a
chance
to
get
even
and
that
s
not
all
said
varrell
they
ll
have
to
write
lies
to
their
families
in
order
to
get
extra
money
to
pay
up
with
and
when
they
get
used
to
lying
about
one
thing
they
ll
lie
about
another
and
keep
on
lying
till
there
s
no
truth
left
in
them
a
little
kid
that
s
tough
is
about
the
meanest
and
most
pitiable
individual
you
can
find
he
goes
down
hill
like
a
ball
rolling
down
an
inclined
plane
the
terms
of
physics
occurred
naturally
to
varrell
who
took
especial
delight
in
the
study
suppose
we
talk
to
the
boys
said
melvin
tentatively
it
would
probably
do
no
good
the
little
fools
don
t
know
enough
to
take
then
we
must
deal
directly
with
bosworth
said
melvin
decisively
it
s
an
awfully
unpleasant
job
to
tackle
you
feel
as
if
you
were
interfering
in
another
fellow
s
private
affairs
and
setting
yourself
up
to
be
better
than
any
one
else
but
the
thing
must
be
varrell
nodded
in
grave
approval
there
s
nothing
else
to
be
done
and
you
re
the
man
for
the
why
not
you
asked
dick
shortly
because
replied
varrell
with
a
smile
of
satisfaction
you
are
richard
melvin
the
president
of
the
senior
class
and
the
most
famous
that
ever
shed
cut
that
out
interrupted
melvin
authoritatively
this
is
a
serious
matter
and
we
can
t
afford
to
have
any
confounded
nonsense
mixed
up
with
varrell
s
smile
faded
reluctantly
away
i
am
serious
you
can
do
the
thing
without
giving
the
fellow
a
chance
to
face
you
down
or
put
you
in
a
ridiculous
light
with
the
rest
of
the
school
or
advertise
your
cheek
you
hold
too
strong
a
position
to
run
any
risk
i
m
a
newcomer
and
practically
why
shouldn
t
both
of
us
go
said
melvin
after
an
interval
of
consideration
still
shrinking
from
an
odious
task
again
his
friend
had
a
decisive
reply
no
he
will
take
it
better
and
it
will
do
more
good
if
you
go
quietly
by
yourself
as
if
you
alone
knew
dick
looked
at
his
watch
i
think
you
are
right
and
if
you
are
the
sooner
the
job
is
over
the
better
so
here
goes
with
these
words
he
clapped
his
cap
on
his
head
and
started
for
the
door
before
varrell
could
raise
himself
from
his
armchair
and
get
across
the
room
he
heard
his
visitor
jumping
quickly
down
the
stairs
oh
dick
well
what
came
from
the
landing
below
remember
that
he
s
slippery
give
it
to
him
straight
don
t
let
him
lie
out
of
never
you
fear
called
back
melvin
as
he
plunged
on
down
the
stairs
bosworth
was
sitting
at
his
desk
with
a
book
open
before
him
his
thoughts
however
were
not
on
his
lesson
as
was
clearly
shown
by
the
moody
fitful
way
in
which
his
eyes
wandered
from
mantel
to
window
his
face
wore
a
gloomy
and
bitter
look
as
if
he
were
brooding
on
some
particularly
disagreeable
event
of
recent
occurrence
that
still
rankled
deep
his
expression
brightened
as
melvin
opened
the
door
in
response
to
the
usual
come
in
for
as
varrell
had
said
the
senior
was
a
man
and
bosworth
who
valued
popularity
far
more
than
the
ordinary
virtues
had
a
moment
of
gratified
vanity
in
the
thought
that
melvin
was
honoring
him
with
a
call
the
pleasure
was
of
short
duration
no
i
think
i
won
t
sit
down
said
the
visitor
my
business
is
a
rather
unpleasant
one
which
i
can
perhaps
better
attend
to
bosworth
s
face
hardened
i
understand
that
you
have
been
gambling
with
some
of
the
little
boys
and
getting
their
money
away
from
i
d
like
to
know
who
says
that
exclaimed
bosworth
indignantly
it
s
a
i
m
sorry
to
hear
you
deny
it
returned
melvin
calmly
the
information
was
pretty
it
s
a
lie
just
the
same
answered
bosworth
fiercely
his
pale
face
becoming
in
spots
still
paler
it
s
no
affair
of
yours
that
s
what
i
expected
you
to
say
in
one
sense
it
isn
t
in
another
it
is
not
only
my
affair
but
that
of
every
fellow
here
who
feels
any
responsibility
for
the
moral
condition
and
honor
of
the
school
it
s
a
contemptible
trick
to
teach
these
little
fellows
to
gamble
the
result
can
t
be
anything
but
bad
for
them
even
if
they
don
t
get
into
trouble
from
it
here
in
school
and
you
know
what
would
happen
if
the
faculty
got
on
to
i
suppose
you
re
on
your
way
to
let
them
know
sneered
bosworth
no
i
m
not
retorted
melvin
taking
a
step
forward
with
clenched
fists
and
then
checking
himself
a
moment
to
master
the
indignation
that
was
boiling
up
in
his
throat
but
mind
you
i
don
t
say
what
i
won
t
do
if
you
keep
this
thing
up
it
s
not
impossible
that
i
may
turn
but
first
i
ll
try
an
easier
method
quit
this
thing
and
quit
it
right
off
or
i
ll
give
you
the
worst
thrashing
you
ever
had
i
ll
keep
on
thrashing
you
till
you
re
glad
to
sneak
out
of
huh
said
bosworth
contemptuously
but
retreating
to
a
safe
position
behind
the
table
i
m
not
the
only
one
that
gambles
he
added
significantly
i
won
t
discuss
that
retorted
melvin
you
re
the
leader
and
that
s
he
turned
toward
the
door
i
hope
i
ve
made
myself
clear
if
you
want
to
get
try
another
game
with
the
little
with
that
melvin
shut
the
door
and
shot
downstairs
as
if
to
put
the
whole
scene
as
quickly
as
possible
behind
him
he
kept
away
from
varrell
s
room
in
order
to
avoid
the
necessity
of
repeating
the
conversation
but
with
all
his
efforts
it
insisted
on
repeating
itself
over
and
over
in
his
own
mind
in
exaggerated
detail
until
he
was
finally
left
with
the
uncomfortable
impression
that
he
had
been
ugly
and
had
made
savage
threats
and
said
things
and
that
bosworth
had
merely
denied
and
sneered
it
s
just
as
i
thought
last
year
he
said
to
himself
dismally
when
grim
was
so
serious
about
the
responsibility
and
the
opportunity
which
the
older
fellows
have
i
felt
then
it
was
all
nonsense
i
know
it
s
so
now
the
fellow
who
undertakes
to
make
things
better
in
school
just
renders
himself
unhappy
and
gets
himself
and
then
he
felt
again
the
impulse
of
the
spirit
that
had
carried
him
through
so
many
months
of
discouragement
to
the
final
triumph
of
the
great
game
unpleasant
though
it
might
be
his
course
was
right
and
having
started
on
it
he
would
abide
the
consequences
without
wavering
or
shrinking
with
this
feeling
uppermost
he
marched
off
serenely
to
his
recitation
if
he
could
have
had
a
glimpse
into
bosworth
s
room
and
seen
there
the
most
frightened
boy
in
school
he
would
not
have
wasted
so
much
time
in
misgivings
his
visit
had
had
its
effect
the
next
morning
phil
did
not
return
promptly
from
his
recitation
when
he
did
come
there
was
a
glint
of
pleased
excitement
in
his
very
expressive
eyes
that
aroused
his
s
curiosity
what
is
it
phil
asked
dick
encouragement
from
sands
the
boy
s
countenance
fell
not
much
i
m
not
likely
to
get
encouragement
from
him
my
news
is
about
something
else
eddy
has
got
his
money
for
an
instant
dick
enjoyed
a
sweet
vision
of
a
gambler
frightened
into
reform
by
bold
threats
making
righteous
restitution
to
his
victims
but
the
vision
merely
appeared
and
vanished
like
the
landscape
under
a
lightning
flash
on
a
dark
stormy
night
leaving
the
boy
more
in
the
dark
than
ever
got
his
money
back
you
don
t
mean
that
bosworth
has
given
it
back
to
him
i
m
not
exactly
certain
about
that
said
phil
all
i
know
is
that
tompkins
came
to
him
asked
him
how
much
bosworth
had
got
from
him
took
out
the
money
said
it
came
from
bosworth
and
then
made
eddy
promise
not
to
play
again
and
gave
it
to
dick
whistled
what
in
the
world
had
tommy
to
do
with
it
didn
t
i
tell
you
that
i
don
t
know
said
phil
impatiently
the
main
thing
is
that
eddy
s
got
his
money
back
and
has
promised
to
keep
out
of
such
things
in
the
it
s
mysterious
said
dick
mysterious
echoed
the
boy
i
don
t
care
about
the
mystery
it
s
a
business
and
eddy
is
mighty
lucky
to
get
out
of
the
hole
the
worst
thing
about
it
is
that
it
will
do
him
no
good
i
can
t
really
sympathize
with
the
fellow
he
hasn
t
any
moral
backbone
at
you
ought
to
try
to
stiffen
him
up
said
the
wise
man
stiffen
him
up
stiffen
an
eel
returned
the
disgusted
junior
the
only
way
you
can
do
that
is
to
kill
if
phil
was
superior
to
curiosity
melvin
was
not
and
varrell
was
not
together
they
lay
in
wait
for
the
westerner
as
he
came
whistling
upstairs
and
in
a
trice
had
him
in
the
room
with
the
door
held
tight
closed
behind
melvin
s
square
shoulders
undergoing
a
but
tompkins
proved
a
most
unwilling
witness
he
declared
that
he
had
no
information
to
give
when
they
threatened
to
choke
him
he
gave
them
a
bland
smile
when
told
he
would
not
be
let
out
for
dinner
he
averred
that
he
wasn
t
hungry
when
promised
imprisonment
for
all
day
he
announced
himself
wholly
content
as
he
had
a
lot
of
hard
problems
to
do
in
which
he
should
be
delighted
to
have
melvin
s
assistance
at
last
varrell
abandoned
the
examination
and
began
to
talk
athletics
presently
he
asked
melvin
whether
he
had
found
bosworth
in
when
he
visited
him
the
day
before
why
yes
replied
dick
didn
t
a
wink
from
varrell
stopped
him
tell
us
about
as
dick
prompted
by
varrell
s
shrewd
questions
launched
out
on
a
detailed
account
of
yesterday
s
interview
tompkins
passed
quickly
from
assumed
indifference
to
open
interest
and
from
open
interest
to
with
the
end
of
the
story
he
burst
into
a
shout
well
that
s
what
i
call
rubbing
it
in
and
the
poor
chap
hadn
t
a
cent
to
his
name
varrell
rose
with
solemnity
look
here
tommy
that
requires
explanation
whatever
he
is
the
man
isn
t
a
poor
chap
in
any
good
sense
he
doesn
t
deserve
any
pity
unless
because
of
the
way
in
which
he
gave
back
the
money
and
that
you
re
bound
to
tell
us
you
ve
said
too
much
now
to
keep
the
tompkins
was
bursting
with
merriment
the
secret
he
could
keep
but
not
the
joke
i
ll
tell
you
two
fellows
not
because
you
ve
made
me
or
because
it
s
any
of
your
business
but
just
because
it
s
so
blamed
funny
that
i
can
t
keep
it
in
and
you
re
the
safest
people
to
trust
it
to
i
made
up
to
bosworth
and
got
him
to
ask
me
to
play
with
him
i
reluctantly
consented
and
before
we
were
through
i
d
cleaned
him
all
out
and
had
the
money
to
give
back
to
the
kids
then
the
very
next
day
dick
pounced
upon
him
and
threatened
his
life
and
he
hadn
t
a
dollar
of
his
gains
about
him
that
s
where
the
joke
comes
in
it
s
rich
and
he
burst
out
again
in
a
noisy
laugh
but
neither
melvin
nor
varrell
seemed
to
appreciate
the
joke
and
that
s
the
way
you
got
the
rascal
to
give
back
the
money
asked
melvin
aghast
yes
why
not
said
tompkins
tar
the
devil
with
his
own
stick
varrell
looked
at
melvin
and
melvin
looked
at
varrell
and
neither
knew
what
to
reply
how
could
you
do
it
said
melvin
at
last
don
t
you
know
that
it
s
totally
against
all
rules
they
d
fire
you
without
a
moment
s
notice
if
they
knew
you
they
won
t
know
it
said
tompkins
coolly
bosworth
isn
t
going
to
tell
them
and
i
m
not
and
you
re
not
besides
i
don
t
play
this
was
only
a
special
but
how
could
you
do
it
repeated
varrell
who
considered
the
practical
side
as
melvin
the
moral
bosworth
must
be
an
old
hand
at
the
tompkins
was
standing
by
the
door
which
melvin
had
long
since
abandoned
he
turned
on
the
threshold
and
holding
his
head
tightly
framed
between
jamb
and
door
he
answered
with
a
patronizing
air
oh
bosworth
plays
a
pretty
good
game
for
a
tenderfoot
but
poker
why
they
teach
it
in
the
public
schools
in
butte
illustration
a
corner
in
sands
s
room
chapter
vii
in
the
baseball
cage
the
poker
incident
caused
repeated
discussions
between
the
classmates
melvin
was
sure
tommy
s
method
was
wrong
though
he
could
not
suggest
a
satisfactory
substitute
except
to
thrash
bosworth
until
he
made
amends
while
varrell
though
disapproving
of
poker
in
general
maintained
that
in
this
exceptional
case
the
means
were
excusable
neither
succeeded
in
bringing
the
other
over
to
his
view
it
happened
that
tompkins
who
was
not
bothered
by
scruples
as
to
his
course
was
the
chief
sufferer
by
it
for
additional
victims
kept
turning
up
with
sad
tales
to
have
their
losses
made
good
by
the
generous
restorer
until
tommy
had
parted
not
only
with
his
questionable
winnings
but
with
the
surplus
of
his
honestly
acquired
quarterly
allowance
as
well
this
latter
fact
he
did
not
confide
to
his
friends
it
seemed
to
detract
somewhat
from
the
excellence
of
the
joke
meantime
the
baseball
practice
in
the
cage
was
taking
the
usual
course
besides
flanahan
two
or
three
other
fellows
were
pitching
among
them
tompkins
the
latter
had
been
pulled
out
of
obscurity
by
some
enthusiast
who
discovered
that
he
had
had
experience
in
the
box
and
so
reluctant
tommy
was
now
forced
to
take
his
regular
turn
in
the
cage
with
the
rest
phil
did
his
work
with
all
the
energy
he
possessed
not
because
he
had
any
real
hope
but
because
his
heart
and
ambition
were
in
the
contest
and
even
the
prospect
that
the
battle
would
go
against
him
did
not
take
away
his
joy
in
the
fighting
flanahan
had
good
sharp
curves
and
high
speed
his
best
balls
were
a
jump
at
the
shoulder
and
a
fine
abrupt
drop
tompkins
had
fewer
curves
at
his
command
but
he
could
vary
his
speed
in
a
most
deceptive
way
and
he
showed
an
ability
to
put
the
ball
where
he
wanted
it
and
where
the
batsman
did
not
like
to
have
it
come
another
advantage
tompkins
possessed
lay
in
his
coolness
gibes
from
batters
or
spectators
never
hurried
or
confused
him
while
flanahan
s
quick
temper
went
to
pieces
under
slight
provocation
smith
the
best
pitcher
of
the
last
season
was
a
third
candidate
but
ranked
unquestionably
after
tompkins
flanahan
s
curves
were
the
delight
and
admiration
of
the
spectators
who
would
cluster
around
the
catcher
s
end
of
the
cage
when
flanahan
was
pitching
and
express
their
appreciation
by
manifold
ejaculations
such
wonderful
rises
and
drops
and
shoots
the
hillburyites
would
certainly
find
impossible
to
hit
and
so
did
the
seatonians
for
that
matter
though
the
result
was
really
due
as
much
to
the
wildness
of
the
pitching
and
the
consequent
fear
of
getting
hit
on
the
part
of
the
batsmen
as
to
the
skill
of
the
pitcher
for
the
most
part
flanahan
preferred
to
let
some
one
else
pitch
for
the
batting
while
he
practiced
by
himself
the
first
time
phil
came
up
to
bat
flanahan
he
had
the
misfortune
to
get
hit
phil
was
a
who
batted
left
and
flanahan
s
wide
out
off
the
plate
caught
the
boy
in
the
back
as
he
turned
to
dodge
and
inflicted
a
painful
bruise
the
result
was
to
give
him
a
scare
that
prevented
his
facing
the
pitcher
for
a
fortnight
and
confirmed
sands
in
the
impression
that
he
was
too
young
and
green
to
be
of
any
use
on
the
school
nine
as
the
cage
practice
is
necessarily
limited
to
pitching
batting
sliding
and
handling
grounders
and
phil
as
a
candidate
for
the
was
not
given
much
chance
at
grounders
he
seemed
to
have
excellent
prospect
of
being
dropped
from
the
squad
among
the
first
it
was
wallace
who
saved
him
from
this
ignominy
wallace
was
the
head
coach
for
baseball
at
the
great
university
near
by
graduate
a
year
or
two
out
of
college
with
an
enthusiasm
as
unprofessional
as
his
knowledge
of
the
game
was
complete
and
technical
he
could
pitch
and
field
and
hit
he
was
a
master
of
the
ritual
of
that
mysterious
coaching
book
in
which
are
written
all
possible
details
of
play
under
all
possible
circumstances
and
on
which
the
varsity
candidates
are
examined
for
their
positions
as
a
candidate
for
a
degree
is
quizzed
by
the
specialists
who
sit
in
commission
over
him
indeed
wallace
was
more
of
a
master
than
the
original
authors
for
the
supplement
was
of
his
own
making
though
not
a
seatonian
himself
his
baseball
sympathies
were
wide
and
his
college
mates
from
seaton
had
found
no
difficulty
in
enlisting
his
help
for
the
school
nine
he
began
with
grounders
which
he
made
the
boys
take
with
heels
together
and
elbows
between
the
knees
bending
slightly
forward
as
they
settled
some
did
this
instinctively
as
the
most
natural
way
others
went
down
on
one
knee
or
tried
to
make
the
hands
alone
a
substitute
for
a
solid
wall
of
arms
and
legs
with
others
again
wallace
found
fault
for
sinking
for
the
ball
and
rising
before
they
got
it
settle
get
the
ball
then
rise
and
throw
was
according
to
the
college
expert
the
right
order
of
movements
for
gathering
in
grounders
after
grounders
came
starting
and
sliding
at
first
he
put
them
through
a
series
of
standing
sprint
starts
like
the
erect
start
for
short
races
with
first
steps
short
to
develop
immediate
speed
then
the
double
balancing
start
that
the
uses
as
he
poises
off
first
base
ready
to
return
instantly
or
go
down
hard
to
second
as
the
need
may
be
in
sliding
he
urged
the
slide
head
first
as
the
college
ideal
at
the
same
time
adding
that
professionals
generally
slide
feet
foremost
for
the
sake
of
greater
safety
good
sliding
is
fearless
sliding
he
said
and
the
man
who
slides
fearlessly
is
much
less
likely
to
be
hurt
than
the
when
they
came
to
the
batting
practice
the
first
thing
which
the
expert
did
was
to
moderate
the
speed
of
the
pitcher
who
was
sending
in
hot
balls
to
show
his
ability
only
slow
pitched
balls
in
the
cage
was
his
warning
the
light
is
too
poor
for
swift
pitching
moreover
in
a
confined
place
like
this
a
batsman
is
likely
to
become
frightened
at
a
swift
ball
as
he
wouldn
t
be
then
he
made
the
batters
stand
firmly
watch
the
ball
closely
step
straight
out
toward
the
pitcher
and
strike
quickly
at
what
they
were
sure
were
good
chances
don
t
worry
he
kept
saying
don
t
watch
the
pitcher
too
much
the
ball
is
the
thing
you
are
trying
to
hit
don
t
commit
yourself
too
soon
wait
till
you
know
what
is
phil
came
up
for
his
trial
as
nervous
as
a
young
boy
can
be
under
the
eyes
of
an
admired
master
whom
he
would
give
a
month
s
allowance
to
please
steady
my
boy
steady
said
the
kindly
voice
of
the
coach
who
probably
felt
with
sands
that
he
was
wasting
his
time
on
an
impossible
candidate
but
who
unlike
sands
was
still
generous
and
glad
to
don
t
be
frightened
step
straight
hit
late
watch
the
ball
and
not
the
pitcher
is
the
thumb
rule
for
good
body
and
more
phil
gathered
himself
together
and
cracked
out
a
good
wrist
hit
that
s
the
way
i
always
like
to
see
that
exclaimed
wallace
approvingly
the
wrist
hitters
are
the
safest
with
face
aglow
with
satisfaction
phil
stole
back
among
the
group
of
waiting
players
step
straight
hit
late
and
watch
the
ball
he
repeated
to
himself
why
didn
t
some
one
tell
me
that
before
i
ve
been
going
contrary
to
every
part
of
that
it
is
to
be
feared
that
phil
s
lessons
on
those
two
days
of
wallace
s
stay
were
somewhat
neglected
he
certainly
haunted
the
cage
at
all
vacant
hours
when
wallace
was
engaged
in
instruction
and
when
the
practice
was
over
he
ran
back
to
his
room
and
put
down
in
a
snatches
of
baseball
wisdom
caught
from
the
collegian
s
lips
many
of
the
notes
were
doubtless
futile
merely
serving
to
give
the
boy
the
satisfaction
of
doing
something
to
help
himself
on
in
his
great
ambition
yet
many
were
of
great
value
not
only
for
immediate
drill
but
also
for
use
later
on
in
answering
questions
that
unexpectedly
arose
when
the
details
of
wallace
s
instruction
were
as
thoroughly
forgotten
by
the
boys
as
the
teachers
comments
on
their
first
translations
wallace
s
view
of
the
pitchers
mystified
phil
a
good
deal
with
flanahan
the
coach
made
short
work
giving
him
only
a
few
words
of
general
advice
tompkins
on
the
other
hand
absorbed
much
attention
that
man
has
the
making
of
a
great
pitcher
in
him
the
collegian
remarked
to
sands
in
phil
s
hearing
a
couple
of
years
of
good
training
would
do
wonders
for
him
he
is
cool
knows
what
he
is
doing
and
has
the
full
arm
shoulder
swing
which
not
one
amateur
in
twenty
ever
what
about
flanahan
asked
sands
he
hasn
t
it
returned
wallace
emphatically
his
is
a
fairly
swift
arm
throw
with
good
curves
and
poor
command
he
s
used
to
playing
and
probably
knows
a
good
deal
about
the
game
without
possessing
any
great
intelligence
i
should
put
him
at
a
guess
on
the
edge
of
the
class
he
has
reached
his
limit
and
is
beyond
instruction
tompkins
on
the
other
hand
is
good
improvable
i
guess
flanahan
will
do
for
us
said
sands
with
a
smug
smile
of
confidence
it
seems
to
me
that
i
ve
met
him
before
mused
wallace
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
flanahan
who
was
still
pitching
but
i
can
t
now
recall
where
or
under
what
circumstances
he
certainly
isn
t
the
kind
of
man
i
like
to
see
on
a
school
oh
he
s
all
straight
insisted
sands
we
often
have
old
fellows
here
who
are
anxious
for
an
education
but
have
begun
i
don
t
doubt
that
replied
wallace
but
none
the
less
ball
players
don
t
belong
on
school
perhaps
it
was
this
difference
of
opinion
regarding
flanahan
that
made
sands
so
lukewarm
in
his
praises
of
the
coach
the
boys
generally
spoke
of
him
with
veneration
but
gave
more
attention
to
his
appearance
and
his
prowess
than
to
his
directions
no
one
profited
more
by
these
than
the
owner
of
the
who
learned
to
stand
firmly
and
step
out
fearlessly
and
as
he
really
had
a
quick
accurate
eye
he
was
soon
hitting
with
the
best
sands
was
oblivious
to
all
improvement
but
the
others
noticed
it
and
smith
went
so
far
as
to
warn
him
you
re
finding
the
ball
right
poole
but
don
t
get
a
swelled
head
over
it
outside
you
may
not
be
able
to
do
a
thing
there
were
baker
and
lydecker
last
year
who
couldn
t
hit
a
balloon
in
the
cage
and
yet
used
to
swipe
out
two
and
three
baggers
most
every
then
phil
went
home
and
consulted
the
rereading
the
quotation
from
wallace
which
dick
had
said
was
the
best
thing
his
had
written
down
the
good
player
the
rare
player
the
one
who
can
analyze
his
own
errors
and
instead
of
giving
up
discouraged
when
he
fails
can
discover
and
remedy
the
fundamental
i
m
willing
to
be
shown
my
faults
said
phil
to
himself
earnestly
and
if
i
stick
to
it
long
enough
and
use
my
brains
i
ought
to
get
and
phil
was
right
those
who
use
brains
do
get
ahead
in
ball
playing
or
anything
else
but
brains
unfortunately
can
not
be
furnished
on
demand
or
ordered
in
advance
like
a
supply
of
coal
for
the
winter
chapter
viii
a
transaction
in
books
hello
dick
may
i
use
your
french
dictionary
without
waiting
for
a
reply
tompkins
pounced
upon
the
book
it
was
the
fourth
time
in
the
last
ten
days
that
he
had
demanded
the
use
of
this
particular
book
while
on
two
other
occasions
during
the
same
period
he
had
found
it
convenient
to
prepare
his
english
versions
at
melvin
s
desk
if
this
had
been
all
melvin
would
not
have
thought
of
objecting
to
some
boys
ownership
in
books
is
but
a
continued
series
of
lendings
and
borrowings
mislayings
losings
and
findings
in
tompkins
however
this
borrowing
habit
was
of
sudden
and
violent
development
similar
tales
of
him
had
come
during
the
past
fortnight
from
other
rooms
haven
t
you
any
books
at
all
demanded
the
senior
a
few
replied
tompkins
with
his
nose
in
the
dictionary
well
haven
t
you
a
french
dictionary
if
i
had
do
you
suppose
i
d
want
to
use
yours
you
certainly
had
one
once
what
s
become
of
it
gone
replied
tompkins
resignedly
turning
back
to
the
b
s
to
find
the
meaning
of
a
word
which
he
had
looked
up
only
a
moment
before
like
the
meaning
of
that
long
adjective
i
just
looked
can
t
you
find
it
when
did
you
use
it
last
don
t
well
where
did
you
see
it
last
at
the
dick
stared
did
some
one
steal
it
or
did
you
lose
it
neither
replied
the
laconic
tompkins
then
you
must
have
sold
yes
i
suppose
i
must
have
sold
it
sighed
tompkins
any
more
questions
he
asked
after
an
interval
as
melvin
gazed
and
wondered
i
really
ought
to
do
this
reading
you
know
i
rather
flunked
on
it
yesterday
and
i
don
t
like
to
repeat
the
performance
there
was
a
half
hour
of
silence
in
the
room
then
melvin
squinting
furtively
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eyes
caught
tompkins
gazing
out
of
the
window
you
ought
to
have
borrowed
of
me
said
dick
quietly
you
could
have
saved
the
books
tompkins
shook
his
head
i
don
t
like
to
borrow
though
i
may
have
to
do
it
what
s
become
of
your
term
allowance
gone
to
those
confounded
little
lambs
that
bosworth
sheared
said
tompkins
angrily
throwing
off
his
pretense
of
indifference
eddy
wasn
t
the
only
fool
by
any
means
first
one
would
come
to
me
and
then
another
and
every
one
of
them
would
put
up
a
mournful
whine
and
promise
never
never
to
do
such
a
thing
again
and
hold
out
his
hand
for
his
money
they
seemed
to
think
that
bosworth
was
having
the
games
just
to
give
them
experience
and
teach
them
profitable
lessons
and
that
i
was
his
agent
to
pay
them
back
when
they
promised
not
to
do
it
again
i
wasn
t
very
careful
about
the
money
i
suppose
and
when
i
finally
shut
down
on
the
thing
a
good
part
of
my
own
was
gone
then
dinsmore
took
the
rest
for
a
baseball
subscription
which
i
d
promised
to
pay
early
he
left
me
just
cents
since
then
the
books
have
been
going
and
it
s
a
month
yet
to
i
have
been
a
with
this
last
statement
melvin
mentally
concurred
he
had
maintained
from
the
beginning
that
the
only
proper
way
of
dealing
with
bosworth
was
to
maul
him
until
he
disgorged
and
his
first
impulse
was
to
tell
tompkins
that
it
served
him
right
for
having
recourse
to
questionable
methods
but
wholesome
respect
for
the
generosity
of
the
boy
and
sympathy
with
him
in
his
present
predicament
effectually
prevented
any
such
retort
and
turned
the
whole
force
of
his
disapproval
against
the
original
offender
for
straight
meanness
that
bosworth
is
the
limit
he
exclaimed
with
eyes
aflame
with
indignation
he
ought
to
be
fired
this
very
minute
he
isn
t
much
of
a
fellow
i
think
myself
answered
tompkins
more
calmly
but
we
can
t
do
anything
about
it
the
firing
isn
t
in
our
hands
or
he
d
go
and
a
good
many
fellows
would
stay
who
now
have
to
say
pretty
abruptly
it
isn
t
bosworth
that
i
m
thinking
of
but
how
i
m
going
to
get
through
the
next
why
don
t
you
write
the
whole
story
home
to
your
father
said
dick
to
whom
the
straightforward
way
always
appealed
tompkins
smiled
wisely
and
have
him
write
back
hot
foot
to
grim
and
want
to
know
what
kind
of
a
school
it
is
in
which
such
scandalous
performances
go
on
under
the
teachers
eyes
and
grim
would
hunt
it
to
the
ground
like
a
setter
after
a
rabbit
no
i
thank
you
that
a
the
inexorable
recitation
bell
broke
in
upon
them
how
mournful
that
bell
sounds
when
you
haven
t
your
lesson
groaned
tommy
as
he
picked
up
his
book
and
started
for
the
french
recitation
it
s
like
the
thing
they
ring
at
funerals
another
flunk
for
me
i
ll
be
dropped
by
the
end
of
the
term
if
i
don
t
get
this
business
off
my
come
in
after
supper
tommy
shouted
dick
at
the
door
and
we
ll
talk
it
over
with
varrell
his
head
is
longer
than
mine
and
he
may
have
something
to
that
evening
the
three
gathered
before
the
depleted
bookshelves
in
tompkins
s
room
in
solemn
conclave
all
agreed
that
to
write
to
tompkins
would
be
equivalent
to
carrying
the
facts
to
the
principal
can
t
you
write
to
your
mother
suggested
melvin
that
would
be
more
dangerous
still
answered
tompkins
dolefully
she
d
be
sure
i
d
gone
to
the
haven
t
you
a
brother
or
an
uncle
or
a
cousin
that
you
could
try
asked
wrenn
i
ve
money
enough
myself
i
could
furnish
you
what
you
want
as
easily
as
can
be
but
i
have
to
give
an
account
of
all
i
spend
and
of
course
i
can
t
lie
about
there
s
uncle
george
in
chicago
said
tompkins
brightening
i
d
thought
of
him
but
he
s
a
bit
risky
too
he
d
help
me
quick
enough
but
i
don
t
know
what
else
he
might
that
s
the
way
out
said
varrell
authoritatively
you
ve
got
to
take
some
risk
just
tell
him
the
whole
story
frankly
and
explain
why
you
don
t
want
to
write
to
your
father
and
i
think
he
ll
be
square
with
you
uncles
usually
are
pretty
generously
disposed
in
the
meantime
don
t
sell
any
more
books
i
ll
lend
you
all
you
to
this
course
the
council
agreed
tompkins
wrote
the
letter
and
waited
six
miserable
days
for
a
reply
which
arrived
by
the
last
mail
of
a
certain
saturday
early
in
march
the
date
was
important
to
tompkins
for
it
was
the
day
which
brought
relief
from
anxiety
to
a
very
worried
and
unhappy
boy
there
was
a
check
in
the
letter
drawn
for
a
larger
amount
than
he
had
requested
there
was
also
some
strong
sensible
advice
and
finally
there
was
a
pledge
to
be
signed
and
returned
before
the
check
was
cashed
binding
master
tompkins
not
to
play
again
during
the
course
of
his
education
this
the
boy
signed
with
eagerness
having
already
of
his
own
accord
made
up
his
mind
to
this
very
course
with
the
pledge
deposited
in
the
and
the
check
safe
in
his
ready
to
be
cashed
on
monday
morning
with
a
feeling
of
relief
warming
his
heart
as
the
bright
drives
the
chill
from
weary
bones
tommy
went
to
bed
that
night
as
nearly
serious
and
grateful
as
he
had
ever
been
in
his
life
for
another
reason
the
date
was
important
on
the
night
of
this
saturday
or
somewhere
between
the
hours
of
six
on
saturday
and
two
on
sunday
the
registrar
s
safe
in
the
basement
of
sibley
was
broken
into
and
plundered
chapter
ix
burglary
graham
was
not
in
seaton
when
the
incident
occurred
he
had
just
risen
from
a
rather
serious
attack
of
pneumonia
and
by
the
doctor
s
order
was
spending
several
weeks
in
the
south
in
hope
of
more
speedy
convalescence
meantime
as
professor
anthony
was
spending
his
sabbatical
year
abroad
moore
the
teacher
of
german
an
elderly
man
of
strongly
pedagogic
stamp
acted
by
virtue
of
seniority
as
chairman
of
the
faculty
and
took
the
principal
s
office
hours
the
safe
stood
in
the
registrar
s
little
office
in
the
basement
of
sibley
it
was
an
old
affair
which
before
the
vault
had
been
put
into
the
school
office
had
held
the
more
important
books
and
papers
belonging
to
the
school
latterly
it
had
served
as
a
kind
of
overflow
strong
box
for
the
less
valuable
papers
or
smaller
sums
of
money
which
came
in
after
the
big
safe
was
closed
or
the
day
s
deposit
had
been
made
at
the
bank
miss
devon
also
kept
in
it
her
official
record
books
and
the
smaller
amounts
of
money
for
the
payment
of
wages
and
other
minor
bills
which
were
under
her
charge
on
saturday
at
six
miss
devon
had
locked
up
ninety
dollars
in
cash
and
a
check
on
a
boston
bank
for
fifty
dollars
on
sunday
afternoon
she
went
to
the
safe
for
a
personal
paper
which
she
had
enclosed
with
the
school
property
the
safe
was
locked
as
usual
and
apparently
in
the
state
in
which
she
had
left
it
the
night
before
but
the
money
and
the
check
were
missing
startled
at
her
carelessness
for
she
felt
that
she
must
have
mislaid
the
money
miss
devon
searched
the
compartments
and
drawers
the
money
was
not
to
be
found
she
locked
the
safe
door
and
opened
it
again
the
lock
was
uninjured
the
safe
showed
no
evidence
of
having
been
tampered
with
trembling
with
anxiety
the
girl
glanced
about
the
room
there
were
two
doors
leading
into
the
office
one
from
outside
by
which
she
had
entered
the
other
a
rarely
used
door
with
an
ordinary
lock
opening
directly
into
the
passage
that
led
past
the
and
the
lavatories
to
the
main
entry
of
the
dormitory
neither
door
showed
anything
unusual
in
its
appearance
she
looked
at
the
windows
and
her
heart
set
up
a
violent
throbbing
the
shades
were
not
in
their
usual
position
and
the
fastening
on
one
sash
was
open
while
sure
as
to
the
unwonted
height
of
the
shades
she
could
not
recall
that
she
had
altered
them
before
leaving
saturday
night
or
that
she
had
given
any
especial
attention
to
the
window
fastenings
it
was
her
habit
to
make
everything
secure
before
she
left
the
office
but
the
labor
involved
in
this
had
long
since
become
mechanical
and
she
had
absolutely
no
recollection
of
anything
in
connection
with
closing
up
on
the
day
before
now
thoroughly
frightened
the
girl
sat
down
and
confusedly
wondered
what
was
to
be
done
the
money
was
gone
no
one
except
herself
knew
the
combination
of
the
safe
no
one
else
was
responsible
for
the
security
of
the
office
if
she
could
only
recall
definitely
that
she
had
locked
the
window
she
must
have
done
it
for
it
was
her
regular
custom
and
yet
she
had
left
rather
early
the
night
before
to
catch
a
car
and
it
was
possible
just
possible
that
she
had
overlooked
it
if
this
was
the
case
she
had
really
been
negligent
her
glance
fell
on
the
safe
and
brought
a
comforting
thought
she
rose
and
wiped
her
eyes
it
s
dreadful
but
i
am
not
at
fault
she
said
to
herself
resolutely
and
i
won
t
worry
a
man
who
could
open
the
safe
so
easily
would
get
in
anyway
whether
the
window
were
locked
or
not
i
ll
just
report
the
matter
to
moore
and
let
him
take
the
miss
devon
let
herself
out
and
went
in
search
of
moore
half
an
hour
later
both
were
in
the
office
devon
collected
and
careful
of
her
words
moore
looking
very
solemn
and
important
and
asking
many
questions
together
they
went
through
the
safe
again
examined
the
windows
and
the
outside
door
and
with
the
aid
of
the
housekeeper
s
key
unlocked
the
door
into
the
passage
and
scrutinized
it
carefully
it
had
shrunk
somewhat
leaving
a
crack
at
the
edge
but
the
lock
was
unharmed
and
the
jamb
unscarred
all
in
all
besides
weariness
and
many
useless
questions
the
investigation
yielded
only
two
tangible
results
neither
of
which
seemed
to
impress
moore
as
of
any
special
value
one
the
discovery
of
a
drop
of
on
the
floor
before
the
safe
which
miss
devon
pointed
out
triumphantly
as
a
proof
that
the
robbery
had
been
committed
during
the
night
by
the
light
of
a
candle
and
the
other
the
fact
that
some
one
had
been
present
on
saturday
morning
while
miss
devon
was
kneeling
before
the
safe
struggling
with
the
rebellious
combination
lock
as
the
door
finally
swung
open
the
girl
had
observed
one
of
the
boys
standing
behind
her
apparently
taking
a
deep
interest
in
her
work
it
was
a
junior
named
eddy
at
this
statement
moore
s
face
took
on
a
superior
smile
how
fortunate
that
it
was
eddy
and
not
some
other
boy
he
said
i
gave
him
permission
to
leave
by
the
eleven
o
clock
train
on
saturday
to
spend
sunday
with
his
cousins
in
boston
his
alibi
is
easily
proved
had
it
not
been
for
this
circumstance
he
might
have
been
subjected
to
a
very
unjust
suspicion
i
should
be
very
loath
to
believe
that
any
student
had
a
hand
in
mightn
t
eddy
have
seen
the
combination
and
told
some
one
else
of
it
suggested
miss
devon
modestly
i
think
not
replied
moore
with
an
air
of
finality
but
yet
condescending
to
explain
himself
if
he
saw
anything
he
probably
saw
no
more
than
that
you
were
having
difficulty
in
opening
the
door
may
be
assured
that
he
forgot
it
immediately
the
prospect
of
going
to
boston
would
exclude
almost
anything
else
from
his
mind
he
was
in
my
recitation
at
ten
o
clock
and
a
more
pupil
i
never
had
i
will
question
him
however
on
his
return
and
make
sure
of
the
fact
i
should
rather
be
of
the
opinion
that
we
have
here
the
work
of
some
clever
professional
who
has
found
an
unusually
good
opportunity
to
ply
his
trade
with
safety
and
we
have
never
had
burglars
in
town
murmured
miss
devon
not
wholly
convinced
i
don
t
see
why
this
little
safe
should
attract
their
notice
shall
you
put
the
matter
in
the
hands
of
the
police
moore
hesitated
that
will
require
consideration
he
answered
we
may
consult
the
police
but
i
doubt
if
we
should
be
willing
to
incur
the
notoriety
of
a
public
investigation
for
so
small
a
sum
the
thief
i
am
afraid
is
secure
in
his
plunder
at
present
we
had
better
say
nothing
about
the
they
separated
at
the
door
and
went
their
respective
ways
moore
calm
in
exterior
but
much
worried
within
miss
devon
in
a
condition
of
woe
closely
bordering
on
hysterics
under
the
teacher
s
smooth
long
words
she
had
divined
an
undefined
suspicion
that
she
might
be
making
much
of
unimportant
incidents
to
cover
some
carelessness
of
her
own
the
discovery
came
upon
her
with
a
shock
if
moore
could
harbor
such
a
doubt
what
might
not
other
people
think
and
say
when
the
story
came
out
merciless
insatiate
gossips
of
the
small
town
with
all
her
heart
she
longed
for
graham
s
speedy
return
chapter
x
moore
s
theory
the
story
or
a
distorted
version
of
it
was
soon
out
the
housekeeper
hinted
at
strange
doings
at
the
office
and
straightway
rumor
flew
that
the
big
vault
had
been
rifled
of
a
thousand
dollars
eddy
came
home
and
was
examined
by
moore
and
his
account
of
the
interview
wormed
out
of
him
by
zealous
questioners
set
a
new
tale
afloat
so
much
worse
than
the
truth
that
the
school
authorities
published
the
facts
in
sheer
the
students
seized
upon
the
incident
with
avidity
petty
thefts
from
gymnasium
lockers
had
been
known
in
previous
years
here
for
once
was
a
real
burglary
in
their
midst
with
a
mystery
to
be
solved
the
boys
attacked
the
problem
tooth
and
nail
but
their
method
was
one
of
hypothesis
and
discussion
rather
than
of
investigation
some
pictured
a
masked
burglar
operating
in
the
dead
of
night
others
held
dark
suspicions
of
miss
devon
still
others
advocated
the
view
that
it
was
a
sneak
student
who
had
in
some
way
got
into
the
room
unobserved
and
juggled
with
the
knob
of
the
safe
until
it
had
opened
for
several
weeks
after
doors
whose
bolts
had
not
been
shot
since
the
year
began
were
very
carefully
locked
when
bedtime
came
among
the
first
arguments
introduced
into
the
discussion
was
the
example
of
the
safe
at
morrison
s
which
tompkins
had
opened
so
easily
in
the
fall
this
suggestion
was
followed
up
among
tommy
s
friends
by
a
jocose
reminder
that
tommy
who
had
been
very
short
was
suddenly
flush
again
outside
the
circle
of
friends
the
statement
was
repeated
without
the
character
of
jest
by
the
time
it
had
made
the
circuit
of
the
school
it
had
acquired
the
addition
that
tompkins
was
suspected
of
the
robbery
and
that
he
was
to
be
expelled
as
soon
as
graham
returned
sands
brought
the
new
version
to
melvin
with
a
worried
expression
on
his
face
tompkins
was
his
second
pitcher
he
couldn
t
afford
to
lose
him
melvin
carried
the
matter
to
varrell
together
they
waited
on
moore
the
acting
principal
received
them
with
his
usual
comprehensive
smile
smile
that
was
typical
of
his
general
disposition
he
was
a
bland
benevolent
scholarly
man
comfortably
content
in
the
consciousness
of
his
superior
attainments
as
compared
with
those
of
the
pupils
under
him
an
easy
marker
and
an
easy
mark
and
of
course
superficially
popular
there
s
a
story
going
around
the
school
about
tompkins
that
we
want
to
protest
against
said
melvin
it
s
an
absurd
story
but
it
might
do
him
some
what
is
the
story
why
that
he
is
suspected
of
breaking
into
the
safe
he
opened
a
safe
last
fall
at
morrison
s
when
no
one
else
could
and
he
s
recently
had
a
present
of
some
money
from
his
uncle
i
think
that
s
all
the
foundation
there
was
for
the
story
we
just
wanted
to
say
that
we
saw
the
check
ourselves
and
knew
how
he
came
by
it
and
that
he
isn
t
at
all
the
fellow
to
do
such
a
dear
me
said
moore
in
real
surprise
no
indeed
i
never
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
i
assure
you
we
haven
t
the
least
suspicion
of
tompkins
or
indeed
of
any
other
they
say
eddy
knew
the
combination
said
varrell
who
now
spoke
for
the
first
time
that
is
an
unwarranted
assumption
replied
moore
warmly
and
very
unjust
to
the
boy
i
have
convinced
myself
by
questioning
him
that
he
did
not
notice
the
combination
and
he
went
to
boston
immediately
afterward
he
is
a
harmless
little
fellow
quite
unequal
to
any
double
he
associates
a
good
deal
with
bosworth
said
melvin
struck
with
this
view
of
the
harmlessness
of
eddy
s
occupations
does
he
indeed
exclaimed
moore
in
a
pleased
tone
i
am
very
glad
to
hear
it
it
always
does
a
little
boy
good
to
come
under
the
influence
of
an
older
boy
of
the
right
kind
bosworth
s
mother
keeps
a
for
students
in
cambridge
and
the
son
is
very
anxious
to
be
a
credit
to
her
and
repay
her
for
her
sacrifices
i
do
not
know
a
neater
more
attractive
boy
in
my
classes
nor
one
who
does
his
work
melvin
gasped
in
astonishment
a
book
knocked
off
the
table
by
varrell
s
hand
fell
heavily
to
the
floor
but
it
produced
no
effect
upon
him
he
dresses
pretty
well
for
a
poor
boy
blurted
dick
not
knowing
what
to
say
and
yet
feeling
that
he
must
make
some
protest
this
answer
touched
one
of
moore
s
pet
theories
and
stirred
up
an
immediate
reproof
you
will
pardon
me
melvin
if
i
term
that
a
very
unjust
judgment
neatness
and
care
with
regard
to
one
s
attire
are
habits
decidedly
worth
cultivating
whether
one
is
rich
or
poor
it
often
happens
that
a
poor
boy
has
friends
who
give
him
clothes
a
great
deal
better
than
he
could
afford
to
buy
it
is
manifestly
unfair
and
unkind
to
charge
him
with
extravagance
until
you
know
fully
the
facts
in
his
that
s
very
true
sir
remarked
varrell
promptly
the
tone
drew
melvin
s
eyes
to
the
speaker
s
face
in
reply
he
got
a
fierce
look
that
shut
him
up
like
an
oyster
was
that
all
inquired
moore
glancing
at
the
clock
yes
sir
replied
varrell
as
the
boys
rose
we
only
wanted
to
tell
you
about
you
may
be
reassured
on
that
point
neither
he
nor
any
other
boy
is
suspected
the
thief
must
have
been
a
professional
but
the
whole
affair
is
a
mystery
which
we
shall
probably
never
solve
thank
you
for
coming
to
see
once
outside
the
conversation
between
the
two
boys
waxed
warm
dick
you
certainly
are
the
limit
what
now
asked
melvin
what
did
you
want
to
lug
bosworth
into
the
conversation
for
don
t
you
know
he
s
a
particular
favorite
of
moore
s
well
if
you
took
german
you
would
bosworth
s
mother
was
a
german
and
he
knows
german
most
as
well
as
he
does
english
rushes
all
the
i
can
t
be
blamed
for
not
knowing
perhaps
not
but
you
need
not
have
connected
him
with
the
i
didn
t
protested
dick
i
just
connected
him
with
well
eddy
with
the
safe
and
bosworth
with
eddy
it
s
all
the
same
returned
varrell
if
grim
had
been
there
you
wouldn
t
have
got
out
of
it
so
easily
he
d
have
turned
you
inside
out
in
no
but
there
wasn
t
anything
more
inside
me
than
out
said
dick
perplexed
no
i
m
afraid
not
rejoined
varrell
with
a
sigh
i
say
dick
who
do
you
really
think
took
that
money
i
don
t
know
anything
about
it
perhaps
a
professional
as
moore
varrell
laughed
aloud
and
he
thinks
some
rich
friend
probably
gave
bosworth
his
clothes
i
know
better
i
saw
the
box
in
which
his
last
suit
came
at
the
express
office
and
it
was
from
one
of
the
most
expensive
tailors
in
boston
it
arrived
two
days
after
the
safe
was
broken
into
and
he
paid
the
bill
in
cash
what
does
that
suggest
to
you
why
that
as
a
deserving
poor
student
he
is
a
anything
else
supposing
i
add
that
the
clothes
were
ordered
three
weeks
ago
before
tommy
very
unexpectedly
cleaned
him
dick
still
looked
puzzled
and
when
tommy
was
through
with
him
he
had
this
suit
coming
and
probably
other
bills
too
and
no
money
to
pay
them
with
unless
he
could
get
some
melvin
stopped
and
looked
blankly
at
his
companion
do
you
really
mean
that
you
think
bosworth
broke
into
the
safe
varrell
nodded
what
an
insane
idea
how
could
he
do
it
every
one
seems
insane
to
a
lunatic
answered
varrell
sharply
if
you
aren
t
crazy
you
are
at
least
too
stupid
to
live
with
sane
people
can
t
you
see
how
he
might
have
been
able
to
do
it
just
dick
pondered
a
moment
and
then
lost
his
patience
no
i
can
t
nor
any
one
else
he
answered
hotly
bosworth
is
a
bad
lot
and
a
school
fraud
and
capable
of
almost
any
ordinary
meanness
but
that
doesn
t
make
him
a
burglar
or
a
murderer
perhaps
if
he
d
tripped
me
up
in
the
hockey
game
instead
of
you
i
might
have
a
different
varrell
laughed
with
the
satisfied
air
of
one
who
knows
that
he
has
the
better
end
of
the
argument
you
re
wrong
there
dicky
old
boy
he
said
clapping
his
irate
friend
cordially
on
the
shoulder
you
could
forgive
him
far
more
easily
for
tripping
you
than
for
tripping
me
i
know
you
better
than
you
do
all
the
same
i
don
t
see
any
connection
between
bosworth
and
the
safe
well
listen
eddy
stood
behind
miss
devon
in
the
office
when
she
was
working
on
the
lock
he
saw
the
combination
and
told
bosworth
of
it
when
he
was
in
bosworth
s
room
about
nine
i
know
he
was
there
then
for
i
saw
him
there
from
my
window
this
suggested
to
bosworth
an
easy
way
in
which
to
make
good
his
losses
and
pay
for
the
clothes
he
certainly
did
pay
a
few
days
after
that
i
believe
was
the
course
of
events
but
i
can
furnish
no
evidence
and
i
don
t
see
how
any
can
be
furnished
unless
eddy
can
be
made
to
what
about
the
check
he
probably
burned
they
stood
at
the
point
at
which
their
ways
parted
melvin
was
thinking
hard
and
kicking
the
gravel
recklessly
with
his
foot
a
squall
of
dust
and
stones
struck
his
companion
in
the
knee
come
let
up
on
that
said
varrell
brushing
off
his
trousers
with
a
show
of
indignation
can
t
you
think
without
using
your
feet
there
are
disadvantages
in
this
football
training
of
excuse
me
laughed
melvin
you
remind
me
of
bosworth
in
your
care
with
regard
to
your
attire
as
moore
put
it
that
last
kick
quite
cleared
my
mind
i
don
t
doubt
that
bosworth
is
bad
enough
to
take
money
from
a
safe
if
he
needed
it
and
there
were
no
chance
of
being
found
out
if
in
this
case
he
was
able
to
do
it
and
afterward
had
money
to
pay
his
bills
with
the
presumption
in
our
minds
is
against
him
and
that
s
all
we
haven
t
any
proof
and
aren
t
likely
to
get
any
tommy
isn
t
suspected
and
we
aren
t
suspected
so
what
business
is
it
of
ours
or
what
could
we
do
if
it
were
our
business
first
answer
me
a
couple
of
questions
said
varrell
why
did
you
go
to
bosworth
and
threaten
him
as
you
did
because
he
was
doing
a
lot
of
harm
in
school
and
that
was
the
only
way
to
stop
and
now
you
ve
stopped
the
do
you
think
he
s
a
fit
fellow
to
stay
here
no
he
s
probably
bad
in
other
ways
and
will
do
more
harm
before
he
s
through
but
i
don
t
know
about
that
and
i
did
know
about
the
gambling
with
the
little
and
i
do
know
about
this
added
varrell
decidedly
in
the
first
place
he
s
got
hold
of
eddy
again
and
made
him
lie
to
moore
about
the
safe
combination
i
saw
him
in
bosworth
s
room
that
saturday
morning
talking
about
there
you
go
off
the
track
again
laughed
dick
you
him
in
bosworth
s
room
you
he
was
talking
about
the
safe
the
only
thing
there
of
any
consequence
at
all
is
what
you
really
a
look
of
annoyance
settled
on
varrell
s
face
look
here
dick
he
began
as
if
he
had
something
important
to
say
then
suddenly
changing
his
tone
he
added
significantly
you
re
right
the
only
thing
of
consequence
is
what
i
saw
some
people
see
more
than
others
and
sheered
off
abruptly
toward
his
room
what
a
queer
chap
wrenn
is
mused
dick
as
he
lazily
climbed
the
dormitory
stairs
sometimes
he
s
as
keen
as
a
razor
at
others
he
gets
an
idea
fixed
in
his
head
and
you
can
t
knock
it
out
with
a
club
i
hope
he
won
t
get
his
mind
set
on
this
safe
chapter
xi
flanahan
strikes
out
graham
was
at
home
again
to
the
relief
of
both
school
authorities
and
boys
he
of
course
heard
the
tale
of
the
robbery
of
the
safe
immediately
after
his
arrival
and
went
over
the
matter
exhaustively
with
miss
devon
whose
troubled
mind
was
definitely
comforted
by
the
principal
s
emphatic
assurance
that
she
was
wholly
beyond
suspicion
later
he
was
given
moore
s
version
i
am
sure
we
are
making
too
much
of
the
matter
said
the
teacher
in
conclusion
we
have
been
a
little
careless
and
are
paying
a
moderate
fine
for
our
the
loss
is
to
me
the
most
unimportant
consideration
said
graham
i
would
gladly
sacrifice
the
money
to
learn
how
it
disappeared
if
a
professional
burglar
took
it
we
are
simply
chance
sufferers
if
a
boy
took
it
the
act
was
probably
due
to
some
desperate
distress
and
sudden
temptation
that
would
mean
according
to
my
experience
either
gambling
or
a
bad
case
of
extravagance
and
debt
these
are
not
pleasant
conditions
to
surmise
but
if
they
exist
i
should
like
to
know
definitely
about
oh
dear
exclaimed
moore
to
whom
such
a
possibility
had
never
occurred
mind
i
don
t
say
that
a
boy
did
it
graham
hastened
to
add
i
am
merely
explaining
why
i
want
to
that
he
did
not
eddy
seemed
to
be
very
nervous
when
i
questioned
him
this
he
was
probably
frightened
at
being
examined
twice
said
moore
i
saw
nothing
of
it
when
i
talked
with
him
have
you
considered
the
possibility
that
miss
what
asked
the
principal
as
the
other
hesitated
may
know
more
than
she
has
told
no
indeed
replied
the
principal
miss
devon
is
as
honest
as
the
day
and
as
methodical
as
a
machine
i
have
known
her
for
years
it
seems
to
me
an
act
of
injustice
even
to
discuss
the
the
principal
s
manner
was
not
as
sharp
as
his
words
but
moore
whose
life
experiences
had
developed
in
him
a
goodly
portion
of
caution
if
not
many
other
mental
possessions
of
a
practical
character
felt
no
encouragement
to
continue
the
argument
and
to
me
an
act
of
treachery
to
suspect
the
boys
he
said
and
so
we
are
thrown
back
again
on
the
hypothesis
of
burglary
but
i
leave
the
problem
with
you
it
is
a
relief
to
drop
the
burden
of
it
from
my
the
principal
watched
him
as
he
trudged
down
the
walk
to
the
street
a
stout
square
figure
marching
sturdily
and
complacently
substantial
behind
benevolent
of
aspect
before
graham
was
also
cautious
and
his
thoughts
as
he
stood
at
the
window
he
would
never
have
uttered
but
they
ran
something
like
this
poor
gullible
old
moore
the
years
go
by
and
leave
with
him
more
knowledge
and
more
satisfaction
in
his
attainments
but
not
an
additional
jot
of
practical
sense
burglars
indeed
miss
devon
may
not
be
sure
that
she
locked
the
window
but
i
am
and
that
to
me
at
least
is
of
more
consequence
when
a
person
of
her
systematic
habits
has
done
the
same
thing
daily
for
the
last
five
years
it
is
highly
improbable
that
she
forgot
it
on
that
particular
day
therefore
the
open
fastening
was
a
blind
to
make
appearances
indicate
that
the
thief
entered
through
the
window
therefore
he
did
enter
by
the
window
but
by
one
of
the
doors
so
far
i
have
fairly
satisfactory
reasoning
behind
me
but
here
i
begin
to
jump
at
conclusions
the
thief
came
in
by
the
passage
door
and
was
a
student
why
a
student
because
it
was
an
enterprise
which
a
desperate
student
might
very
possibly
conceive
but
the
servants
never
and
if
a
student
there
certainly
exists
somewhere
in
the
school
a
which
must
be
discovered
and
cleansed
what
a
delightful
prospect
for
a
man
to
come
home
to
up
the
path
from
the
street
came
a
youthful
figure
of
medium
height
planting
foot
after
foot
with
an
air
of
business
and
determination
sands
said
graham
to
himself
another
unpleasant
task
but
this
at
least
will
soon
be
you
sent
for
me
yes
to
talk
with
you
about
flanahan
are
you
likely
to
want
him
on
the
nine
yes
sir
answered
the
boy
with
a
wondering
face
he
s
our
best
then
i
am
glad
that
i
can
give
you
such
early
notice
he
will
probably
not
be
allowed
to
why
not
sir
because
i
am
convinced
from
various
facts
which
i
have
learned
that
he
is
not
a
proper
person
to
play
on
our
do
you
think
that
we
are
hiring
him
sir
said
sands
a
flush
of
indignation
burning
on
his
cheeks
graham
looked
at
the
student
sharply
on
the
boy
s
face
was
an
expression
of
bitter
disappointment
and
of
indignation
but
no
sign
of
guilt
no
i
do
not
he
replied
heartily
we
haven
t
fallen
so
low
as
what
is
it
then
that
you
have
against
him
simply
that
he
is
not
considered
an
amateur
above
suspicion
of
taint
i
made
some
inquiries
concerning
him
before
my
return
and
the
results
were
in
my
opinion
are
you
about
it
sure
as
to
my
opinion
which
i
may
also
say
is
the
opinion
of
wallace
who
helped
me
in
the
investigation
the
wisest
course
for
flanahan
would
be
to
withdraw
voluntarily
from
the
baseball
practice
and
devote
himself
to
the
work
for
which
he
says
he
came
is
this
final
came
through
sands
s
quivering
lips
isn
t
he
to
have
a
chance
to
hear
the
charges
and
defend
himself
certainly
if
he
desires
it
replied
graham
promptly
you
may
come
too
and
a
few
others
who
are
especially
interested
i
want
to
be
fair
to
you
all
but
my
first
duty
is
to
the
the
news
was
quickly
abroad
discussed
in
every
room
and
at
every
dormitory
entrance
the
boys
naturally
favored
the
unjustly
oppressed
though
some
of
the
older
fellows
of
influence
like
john
curtis
dickinson
and
melvin
who
were
not
baseball
players
sided
with
the
principal
sands
was
disconsolate
flanahan
furious
the
latter
had
talked
with
graham
and
returned
greatly
excited
and
able
to
give
only
a
most
incoherent
account
of
the
interview
on
the
main
subject
the
pitcher
s
explanations
were
not
entirely
satisfactory
to
his
supporters
he
asserted
wildly
denied
sweepingly
and
fortified
his
statements
by
expletives
which
repelled
the
sands
himself
was
somewhat
ashamed
of
his
protégé
as
he
led
him
into
the
principal
s
room
for
the
hearing
and
sat
down
at
his
side
near
the
door
graham
had
not
yet
come
in
melvin
and
varrell
sat
near
his
desk
at
the
upper
end
of
the
long
room
opposite
the
door
at
the
side
were
curtis
and
arthur
wheelock
the
manager
and
several
others
the
tension
of
the
waiting
seemed
to
be
telling
on
flanahan
s
nerves
his
naturally
red
face
had
taken
on
a
deeper
hue
his
eyes
shifted
rapidly
from
point
to
point
his
fists
opened
and
closed
and
shook
convulsively
his
head
nodded
in
sudden
jerks
in
emphatic
support
of
the
whispered
assertions
which
sands
seemed
to
be
rather
combating
than
listening
to
did
you
hear
that
said
varrell
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
pair
of
course
i
didn
t
nor
you
either
said
melvin
i
can
t
hear
whispers
at
that
distance
sands
looks
like
a
man
trying
to
hold
a
fighting
bulldog
i
don
t
envy
him
his
sh
said
varrell
still
staring
at
the
two
the
fellow
s
wild
he
s
just
threatened
to
smash
graham
s
face
sands
can
t
control
him
quiet
i
ll
repeat
for
dick
gaped
in
wonder
he
could
see
flanahan
s
fierce
manner
his
clenched
fists
and
lips
excitedly
moving
but
not
a
single
distinct
sound
reached
him
varrell
with
eyes
glued
on
the
gesticulating
man
began
to
repeat
in
phrases
which
matched
the
pitcher
s
agitated
nods
i
m
no
professional
whoever
says
so
is
a
liar
if
he
tells
me
so
again
i
ll
smash
his
face
yes
i
will
and
i
don
t
care
who
he
is
whether
he
s
principal
of
this
old
place
or
not
he
s
no
better
than
me
i
ll
take
it
out
of
him
if
he
gives
me
any
lip
see
if
i
don
t
i
know
what
he
s
been
up
to
he
s
been
sneaking
around
brockville
what
i
got
from
brockville
was
too
small
to
count
more
than
expenses
let
me
alone
i
tell
you
i
can
take
care
of
myself
fired
what
do
i
care
about
being
fired
just
let
him
say
a
word
and
i
ll
baste
him
one
in
the
jaw
that
he
ll
i
ve
omitted
the
cuss
words
added
varrell
in
another
tone
graham
entered
and
walked
toward
his
desk
did
he
really
say
that
wrenn
whispered
dick
are
you
fooling
or
not
varrell
gave
him
an
indignant
look
of
course
he
said
it
and
he
meant
it
too
do
you
think
i
d
fool
about
a
thing
like
this
how
d
you
know
don
t
ask
that
now
you
idiot
just
watch
the
irishman
and
see
that
he
doesn
t
do
anything
at
graham
s
suggestion
the
boys
took
seats
near
his
desk
the
principal
then
read
aloud
two
or
three
letters
reported
certain
facts
which
he
had
himself
discovered
repeated
the
opinion
of
wallace
and
then
asked
flanahan
what
he
had
to
say
most
of
those
things
are
lies
said
the
pitcher
fiercely
i
ain
t
a
professional
if
they
say
so
they
there
s
a
difference
of
opinion
as
to
what
constitutes
a
professional
said
graham
kindly
we
will
not
argue
about
the
name
the
question
for
us
is
whether
you
satisfy
our
standard
if
you
have
ever
received
money
for
playing
whether
the
sum
was
large
or
small
we
can
not
allow
you
to
play
on
our
i
tell
you
it
s
just
an
attempt
to
blacken
my
reputation
as
an
amateur
screamed
flanahan
i
don
t
care
whether
i
play
on
this
measly
team
or
not
but
whoever
says
i
m
not
an
amateur
is
a
graham
rose
you
forget
yourself
flanahan
he
said
sternly
flanahan
choked
an
instant
then
beside
himself
with
fury
burst
forth
in
a
flood
of
personal
invective
and
threats
aimed
directly
at
the
principal
so
unexpected
and
so
unparalleled
was
the
outbreak
that
most
of
the
audience
sat
silent
and
aghast
not
knowing
what
to
think
or
do
there
were
three
however
to
whom
a
few
expressions
were
warning
enough
melvin
and
varrell
sprang
forward
clutched
the
irate
by
the
arms
and
swung
him
about
while
sands
leaped
to
their
support
from
the
other
side
as
flanahan
cursed
and
struggled
curtis
and
wheelock
came
to
their
senses
and
lent
assistance
together
they
hustled
the
furious
rebel
out
at
the
door
like
a
driven
through
a
hole
in
the
line
on
a
tandem
play
a
few
seconds
later
graham
was
standing
in
the
empty
room
conscious
of
a
curious
mixture
of
feelings
that
such
a
scene
should
have
been
possible
but
delight
in
the
unhesitating
loyalty
of
the
boys
around
the
corner
of
carter
dick
melvin
s
two
hands
held
varrell
s
shoulders
hard
pressed
against
the
brick
wall
no
you
don
t
it
s
of
no
use
to
squirm
because
i
m
not
going
to
let
you
off
this
thing
has
got
to
be
explained
and
with
it
some
other
mysteries
the
more
i
think
about
it
the
more
there
is
to
explain
you
knew
what
phil
and
i
were
muttering
when
you
were
out
of
hearing
in
the
next
room
you
heard
what
this
villain
was
whispering
to
sands
feet
away
you
saw
little
eddy
in
bosworth
s
room
talking
about
the
safe
and
you
knew
what
he
said
sometimes
you
don
t
know
what
is
going
on
right
beside
you
sometimes
you
hear
what
two
fellows
are
saying
to
each
other
across
the
street
no
juggling
now
out
with
the
secret
and
be
quick
about
it
or
i
you
re
a
fool
dick
retorted
the
smiling
wrenn
or
you
wouldn
t
have
to
ask
me
let
me
go
and
i
ll
come
in
after
supper
and
tell
you
let
me
go
do
you
hear
well
then
till
if
you
re
not
on
hand
by
seven
i
ll
come
after
you
and
squeeze
the
life
out
of
you
this
he
added
catching
poor
wrenn
under
the
arms
and
giving
him
a
hug
that
threatened
to
crush
in
all
his
ribs
at
once
no
more
of
that
gasped
varrell
i
ll
chapter
xii
varrell
explains
himself
here
i
am
said
varrell
opening
the
door
of
melvin
s
room
just
as
the
clock
struck
seven
you
don
t
deserve
to
see
me
but
i
m
here
assault
me
like
that
again
and
i
ll
swear
out
a
warrant
for
your
a
lot
you
know
about
warrants
sniffed
melvin
though
that
may
also
be
one
of
your
specialties
whatever
a
warrant
may
be
it
won
t
catch
you
as
i
ll
catch
you
in
five
minutes
if
you
don
t
make
a
clean
breast
of
the
whole
thing
without
any
wind
said
varrell
in
contempt
you
remind
me
of
tommy
when
he
talks
about
come
wrenn
this
is
a
wrong
way
to
begin
warned
melvin
get
down
to
business
you
agreed
to
explain
yourself
now
out
with
where
shall
i
begin
if
you
had
any
sense
no
explanation
would
be
and
if
i
haven
t
it
s
my
misfortune
and
not
my
fault
so
don
t
throw
it
at
me
begin
at
the
varrell
stretched
himself
out
in
an
well
you
know
that
i
am
a
little
i
used
to
think
so
replied
melvin
but
these
things
that
have
occurred
lately
don
t
seem
to
indicate
three
years
ago
i
had
the
scarlet
fever
went
on
varrell
paying
no
attention
to
the
comment
and
it
left
my
ears
in
bad
condition
there
is
no
use
in
going
into
the
details
of
the
case
it
is
enough
to
say
that
at
one
time
the
outlook
was
pretty
bad
and
there
was
a
general
fear
that
i
should
become
worse
instead
of
better
my
mother
was
greatly
worried
about
me
and
consulted
all
sorts
of
people
who
are
supposed
to
know
about
such
cases
some
said
that
the
deafness
would
increase
others
that
it
might
decrease
if
my
general
health
improved
as
the
chances
were
apparently
against
me
they
put
me
through
a
thorough
course
of
with
the
idea
that
if
my
deafness
actually
did
increase
it
would
then
be
harder
for
me
to
learn
luckily
my
hearing
gradually
improved
as
i
got
better
and
an
operation
put
me
ahead
still
farther
so
that
now
i
can
hear
if
not
as
well
as
you
at
least
decently
and
you
still
kept
up
the
i
had
to
much
that
i
was
not
quite
clear
about
i
could
make
out
with
the
use
of
my
eyes
i
finally
got
a
kind
of
mixed
sense
my
eye
helped
out
my
ear
and
my
whole
impression
was
due
to
them
both
so
i
ve
used
it
right
but
is
it
a
thing
you
can
really
count
on
asked
dick
i
ve
always
supposed
that
was
a
guessing
at
what
people
were
it
is
guessing
as
reading
print
is
guessing
only
in
there
is
greater
chance
for
mistake
for
two
very
different
words
are
sometimes
expressed
with
exactly
the
same
appearance
of
the
lips
still
i
ve
seen
some
very
clever
i
knew
a
bank
teller
who
had
suddenly
lost
his
hearing
who
was
able
in
three
months
to
do
all
the
work
of
his
position
in
two
or
three
languages
that
s
where
i
m
handicapped
i
m
used
only
to
english
that
s
why
i
can
t
do
anything
in
pearson
s
classes
when
he
reads
french
and
richardson
s
mop
of
a
mustache
must
be
an
you
bet
it
is
i
loathe
at
this
point
melvin
s
questions
seemed
to
have
run
out
for
he
lapsed
into
a
meditative
silence
which
lasted
at
least
a
minute
then
he
suddenly
jumped
up
grabbed
his
quiet
visitor
by
the
shoulder
and
glared
threateningly
into
his
eyes
come
now
stop
it
and
tell
me
the
truth
you
re
just
trying
to
jolly
it
s
the
truth
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
said
varrell
nodding
his
head
in
solemn
accentuation
of
each
phrase
go
and
sit
down
melvin
dropped
back
into
his
chair
do
you
remember
continued
varrell
when
we
went
up
to
boston
together
last
week
and
i
suddenly
burst
into
a
laugh
you
asked
me
what
was
the
matter
and
i
told
you
that
a
funny
story
had
just
come
to
me
the
funny
story
was
told
by
a
drummer
facing
us
three
seats
ahead
you
certainly
can
t
have
forgotten
the
time
when
we
serenaded
masters
and
he
came
out
on
his
front
porch
and
spoke
with
the
red
fire
playing
on
his
face
and
the
fellows
yelling
and
blowing
tin
horns
wasn
t
i
the
only
one
who
knew
what
he
said
that
s
right
said
melvin
and
didn
t
you
see
how
i
watched
flanahan
this
afternoon
i
had
to
i
can
tell
you
those
little
short
sentences
are
hard
to
i
suppose
i
ll
have
to
believe
you
said
melvin
reluctantly
you
would
have
done
it
long
ago
if
you
weren
t
so
blessed
ignorant
hello
phil
poole
nodded
cordially
and
sat
down
did
you
ever
hear
of
phil
why
yes
i
know
some
one
at
home
who
is
pretty
good
at
it
can
you
do
it
why
do
you
ask
i
ve
suspected
you
two
or
three
times
but
i
thought
i
d
better
not
say
anything
till
you
spoke
of
it
varrell
gave
melvin
a
reproachful
glance
dick
here
doesn
t
believe
in
it
did
you
ever
see
the
shadow
trick
no
replied
phil
varrell
got
up
give
us
a
big
sheet
of
paper
he
said
that
s
it
come
he
pinned
the
white
paper
to
the
wall
on
a
level
with
phil
s
head
placed
phil
near
it
and
adjusted
the
lamp
on
the
shelf
opposite
so
that
a
sharp
profile
of
the
boy
s
face
fell
on
the
paper
next
he
stationed
melvin
two
or
three
steps
in
front
of
the
boy
and
then
having
bound
a
heavy
handkerchief
around
his
own
ears
took
a
place
just
behind
phil
now
phil
without
moving
your
head
and
in
your
ordinary
tones
say
something
to
phil
obeyed
varrell
watched
the
shadow
of
the
moving
lips
on
the
screen
repeat
commanded
varrell
phil
repeated
flanahan
has
been
fired
said
varrell
right
cried
the
boy
delighted
try
again
the
experiment
was
repeated
several
times
and
with
one
or
two
exceptions
varrell
read
correctly
from
the
screen
why
you
re
a
regular
wizard
cried
melvin
pulling
the
bandage
from
his
friend
s
head
that
s
the
greatest
stunt
i
ever
it
s
a
pretty
severe
test
if
i
had
known
what
you
were
talking
about
so
that
i
could
have
had
something
to
start
with
i
shouldn
t
have
failed
the
last
time
that
s
the
funny
thing
about
at
one
instant
it
s
a
blank
and
the
next
you
get
the
key
and
the
whole
thing
flashes
out
but
even
this
amazing
exhibition
could
not
distract
dick
s
mind
from
the
robbery
now
tell
me
please
he
began
what
you
really
know
by
this
method
or
any
method
about
what
eddy
said
to
bosworth
that
saturday
morning
in
his
varrell
looked
significantly
at
phil
oh
you
can
trust
him
dick
made
haste
to
say
phil
is
a
lot
safer
than
i
i
hope
you
won
t
think
phil
that
i
m
in
the
habit
of
eavesdropping
a
good
many
times
i
deliberately
close
my
eyes
to
what
people
are
saying
so
as
not
to
understand
things
they
don
t
mean
me
to
know
but
bosworth
is
thoroughly
bad
and
ought
to
be
shown
up
and
since
he
has
got
hold
of
little
eddy
again
i
ve
kept
my
eyes
peeled
eddy
was
walking
about
in
bosworth
s
room
that
saturday
morning
before
he
went
to
boston
i
can
see
pretty
clearly
from
my
east
window
any
one
who
comes
near
bosworth
s
window
and
i
was
sure
that
i
caught
the
words
and
the
last
i
am
positive
about
for
it
s
a
long
word
and
easy
to
do
you
suspect
bosworth
of
breaking
into
the
safe
asked
phil
quickly
yes
i
do
answered
varrell
but
until
it
can
be
proved
i
don
t
want
the
subject
how
could
he
get
into
the
room
persisted
phil
now
deeply
interested
by
the
passage
do
you
think
he
got
the
housekeeper
s
keys
no
i
don
t
replied
varrell
though
it
wouldn
t
have
been
impossible
for
any
one
to
get
them
there
was
an
easier
way
the
door
opens
out
and
fits
very
loosely
he
probably
pried
it
with
what
with
the
flat
that
stands
in
the
corner
next
to
the
stairs
it
is
strong
and
has
a
wide
blade
that
would
not
leave
much
of
a
mark
but
mind
i
guess
all
this
i
haven
t
any
proof
do
you
mean
to
try
to
get
proof
that
s
exactly
what
i
mean
to
do
said
varrell
smiling
i
say
dick
you
d
better
take
lessons
of
poole
he
s
found
out
more
in
three
minutes
than
you
have
in
a
varrell
s
hand
was
already
on
the
when
he
checked
himself
and
turned
by
the
way
phil
if
you
want
to
stand
well
with
sands
be
careful
what
you
say
about
flanahan
sands
is
awfully
cut
up
about
the
whole
business
ashamed
and
mad
and
disgusted
to
think
that
he
has
been
pushing
such
a
mucker
just
say
nothing
to
him
about
it
or
you
ll
get
him
down
on
thank
you
said
phil
i
ll
be
footnote
a
duplicate
of
this
interesting
experiment
will
be
found
recorded
in
an
article
on
in
the
for
january
chapter
xiii
the
spring
running
john
curtis
clapped
the
book
together
with
a
sigh
of
relief
that
s
the
end
much
obliged
to
you
going
home
for
vacation
next
week
no
said
dick
are
you
no
sir
replied
john
no
vacation
for
me
now
that
i
ve
got
into
the
grinding
habit
you
can
bet
i
m
not
going
to
slacken
up
do
you
know
what
i
ve
been
doing
all
winter
studying
i
hope
answered
melvin
you
ve
not
been
here
very
often
except
on
such
errands
as
that
s
right
and
i
m
doing
a
lot
better
than
i
did
i
m
getting
on
to
a
lot
of
things
that
used
to
seem
all
shut
up
to
me
the
dutch
phases
me
the
most
i
don
t
know
why
it
is
but
some
way
it
won
t
go
down
i
swallow
hard
at
it
too
i
ve
dropped
the
greek
and
am
taking
latin
over
again
my
french
and
mathematics
are
pretty
fair
and
i
m
a
regular
shark
at
dick
hooted
then
checked
himself
suddenly
they
are
all
sharks
in
chemistry
i
should
judge
by
the
reports
the
fellows
give
curtis
smiled
grimly
i
m
as
good
as
any
you
ask
some
of
them
and
see
it
s
the
first
thing
that
i
ve
really
done
well
since
i
entered
this
old
mill
the
dutch
is
the
worst
i
don
t
think
old
moore
is
just
square
about
it
either
he
lays
himself
out
on
those
fellows
who
know
it
all
and
just
skims
by
us
poor
dopes
who
are
he
s
and
easy
isn
t
he
asked
dick
that
depends
he
isn
t
savage
like
richardson
nor
satirical
like
wells
but
he
lets
a
lot
of
tomfoolery
go
on
in
his
class
and
smiles
blandly
at
it
all
and
then
suddenly
gets
wild
and
drops
on
some
one
like
a
hodful
of
bricks
from
the
top
of
a
ladder
as
it
s
usually
the
wrong
person
it
makes
what
fellows
are
in
it
asked
dick
interested
oh
various
ones
tompkins
and
bosworth
are
the
worst
bosworth
isn
t
often
suspected
because
he
is
a
kind
of
a
favorite
of
the
old
man
and
always
lies
out
if
he
s
caught
tompkins
is
smarter
and
he
won
t
lie
like
that
in
him
but
he
has
cheek
like
a
what
does
he
do
oh
all
sorts
of
things
i
can
t
remember
them
the
other
day
he
came
running
in
from
the
gym
without
changing
his
clothes
he
d
just
slipped
his
coat
over
his
sleeveless
shirt
and
buttoned
it
up
high
in
the
neck
he
unbuttoned
it
again
in
the
class
without
thinking
and
moore
saw
the
low
neck
underneath
i
don
t
want
any
boys
in
my
classroom
he
said
tompkins
go
and
dress
yourself
properly
tommy
went
out
and
stayed
half
an
hour
when
he
came
back
he
had
on
patent
leather
shoes
with
gaiters
a
prince
albert
coat
gloves
a
standing
collar
and
a
silk
hat
where
he
got
the
hat
i
don
t
know
he
stopped
a
moment
in
the
doorway
and
all
the
fellows
looked
around
then
he
took
off
his
hat
and
walked
calmly
up
to
his
what
did
moore
do
asked
melvin
fire
him
out
no
he
just
said
thank
you
tompkins
and
went
on
it
was
a
great
but
some
way
it
didn
t
seem
to
have
the
effect
intended
by
the
way
they
say
he
ll
have
to
do
the
pitching
this
year
is
he
any
good
phil
thinks
so
and
wallace
i
believe
spoke
well
of
you
d
better
warn
him
then
to
be
careful
he
doesn
t
do
anything
bad
and
he
seems
a
nice
fellow
at
bottom
but
these
little
tricks
may
get
him
into
trouble
they
d
fire
the
pitcher
on
the
nine
just
as
quick
as
anybody
else
you
remember
they
sent
off
one
fellow
last
year
for
putting
a
bonnet
on
the
head
of
that
plaster
diana
that
stands
in
the
that
was
for
example
returned
dick
vigorously
those
casts
were
the
gifts
of
a
lot
of
the
alumni
and
the
fooling
with
them
had
to
be
they
stopped
it
for
that
fellow
anyway
said
curtis
dryly
is
this
meeting
on
saturday
going
to
be
any
good
i
hope
so
said
dick
there
ll
be
the
usual
indoor
events
and
some
short
dashes
on
the
wooden
track
outside
we
ve
given
good
handicaps
and
there
ought
to
be
some
hard
then
it
ll
have
to
be
better
than
the
faculty
trophy
performance
last
month
that
was
about
as
keen
as
a
croquet
we
ll
improve
on
that
replied
the
manager
confidently
the
fellows
have
been
doing
better
there
were
practical
reasons
for
the
existence
of
the
march
handicap
meeting
it
gave
an
inviting
opportunity
for
boys
of
every
degree
of
ability
to
appear
without
disadvantage
in
a
public
contest
and
so
brought
out
new
material
it
was
likewise
both
a
formal
closing
of
the
winter
s
athletic
work
and
the
first
account
of
stock
for
the
greater
contests
of
the
spring
with
dickinson
and
travers
in
the
sprints
todd
in
the
hurdles
and
curtis
for
the
hammer
and
shot
there
was
still
in
school
a
very
substantial
remnant
of
last
year
s
winning
team
with
which
to
start
the
spring
campaign
against
hillbury
yet
gaps
remained
to
be
filled
new
seconds
and
thirds
had
to
be
provided
where
firsts
seemed
fairly
safe
and
better
men
had
to
be
found
if
better
men
there
were
for
the
most
strongly
defended
events
in
the
jumps
and
the
pole
vault
was
an
especial
dearth
of
good
material
melvin
had
been
practicing
the
high
jump
in
the
course
of
his
daily
gymnasium
exercise
hours
though
without
any
idea
of
excelling
in
it
with
legs
full
of
spring
and
some
intelligence
to
direct
his
efforts
the
height
at
which
he
failed
had
gradually
lifted
a
month
before
at
the
faculty
trophy
meeting
he
had
astonished
himself
by
doing
five
feet
four
to
the
school
champion
s
five
feet
five
the
practice
possessed
now
for
him
an
additional
interest
if
he
could
keep
on
gaining
inches
in
the
same
steady
way
the
spring
contests
would
find
him
able
to
clear
a
very
considerable
height
varrell
too
had
caught
the
fever
and
was
toiling
at
the
pole
vault
with
all
the
zeal
and
intelligence
which
this
peculiar
boy
possessed
a
considerable
crowd
gathered
that
saturday
afternoon
about
the
wooden
track
which
lies
behind
the
gymnasium
for
the
dash
the
contestants
came
in
a
flock
four
men
in
a
trial
heat
after
heat
in
quick
succession
then
the
winners
in
sets
of
and
three
men
in
the
final
heat
the
baseball
candidates
were
here
almost
to
a
man
for
they
had
been
practicing
starts
and
dashes
during
the
winter
for
base
running
and
now
had
their
trying
out
dick
watched
with
interest
to
see
what
phil
would
do
with
his
three
feet
handicap
and
was
delighted
to
see
his
get
off
so
sharply
and
take
his
heat
so
easily
the
first
the
boy
ran
against
sands
and
beat
him
without
difficulty
the
second
he
took
from
jordan
by
a
narrower
margin
only
in
the
final
heat
did
he
fail
when
jones
a
middler
took
first
and
travers
second
with
phil
a
poor
third
good
work
poole
said
macrae
a
middler
rooming
in
the
same
entry
who
was
just
coming
out
for
the
thousand
yards
i
only
ask
to
do
as
but
macrae
did
better
he
ran
his
race
with
twenty
yards
handicap
and
finished
first
close
to
the
school
record
the
middlers
grew
enthusiastic
what
a
handicap
said
dickinson
reproachfully
to
melvin
as
he
took
his
place
on
the
scratch
for
the
three
hundred
and
looked
forward
to
the
front
man
standing
well
around
the
curve
i
may
as
well
not
it
s
not
too
much
for
your
best
old
man
replied
the
manager
confidently
you
never
know
what
you
can
do
till
you
dickinson
did
not
answer
for
he
was
already
on
his
mark
with
the
tense
serious
expression
on
his
face
which
dick
liked
to
see
with
the
pistol
report
he
was
off
making
a
splendid
the
manager
in
a
momentary
flash
of
joy
contrasted
with
the
hesitancy
of
the
year
before
whipping
himself
quickly
into
his
stride
he
passed
lord
on
the
back
stretch
sandford
on
the
straightaway
at
the
end
of
the
first
lap
and
then
pushed
for
von
gersdorf
who
had
made
good
use
of
his
twenty
yards
start
and
with
his
short
stout
legs
flying
under
him
easily
doubled
the
hard
corners
that
delayed
the
pursuer
von
gersdorf
struck
the
final
curve
with
dickinson
at
his
heels
on
the
curve
gained
the
two
plunged
into
the
final
stretch
with
four
yards
of
interval
between
them
panting
ahead
with
quick
staccato
strokes
swinging
again
into
the
wide
stride
that
looked
as
easy
and
natural
as
the
piston
motion
of
a
fine
engine
and
yet
was
challenging
muscle
and
nerve
and
heart
to
their
utmost
go
it
gerty
go
it
shouted
the
middlers
it
s
yours
determined
to
hold
his
lead
a
second
longer
von
gersdorf
dug
his
spikes
into
the
soft
board
made
a
final
frantic
spurt
and
lifted
his
arms
to
meet
the
string
with
his
found
no
string
to
meet
dickinson
had
carried
it
away
before
him
what
a
race
exclaimed
tompkins
as
he
sat
with
varrell
on
the
wall
that
s
what
i
call
sport
i
d
go
miles
to
see
that
again
what
s
the
time
asked
curtis
over
the
shoulders
of
the
men
who
held
the
watches
beat
it
by
two
seconds
you
don
t
say
so
and
he
pretended
he
couldn
t
do
anything
on
this
track
melvin
helped
the
runner
up
the
bank
to
the
gymnasium
and
bothered
himself
with
neither
the
record
nor
the
race
how
is
the
ankle
was
his
first
anxious
question
did
you
feel
it
not
a
bit
stammered
dickinson
between
gasps
but
the
terrible
they
stopped
the
yard
hurdles
and
the
six
hundred
yard
run
came
next
todd
won
the
hurdles
from
scratch
the
six
hundred
went
to
cary
a
middler
who
ran
a
steady
race
from
a
good
start
dickinson
this
time
succumbing
to
the
corners
and
the
handicap
and
finishing
third
the
scene
now
changed
to
the
gymnasium
where
the
last
three
events
were
to
come
off
you
fellows
want
to
do
something
said
marks
coming
over
to
the
seat
where
melvin
varrell
and
curtis
were
sitting
ready
for
their
events
the
middlers
are
beginning
to
crow
it
doesn
t
amount
to
anything
answered
curtis
with
a
little
sniff
of
contempt
anybody
can
beat
a
scratch
man
if
you
give
him
enough
of
course
rejoined
marks
but
they
always
were
a
fool
class
some
of
their
men
have
done
pretty
well
too
it
s
a
bad
thing
for
middlers
to
have
a
high
opinion
of
it
didn
t
hurt
us
last
year
said
melvin
the
pole
vault
was
started
and
varrell
nerved
himself
for
his
first
public
appearance
he
looked
at
no
one
for
he
could
feel
that
curious
questions
were
running
among
the
spectators
and
he
feared
to
surprise
discouraging
comments
on
lips
as
he
faced
the
bar
in
the
familiar
position
this
fear
vanished
he
took
his
run
stuck
his
pole
firmly
into
the
soft
plank
rose
with
a
fine
nervous
spring
and
swung
himself
lightly
over
even
as
he
dropped
his
courage
came
again
conscious
that
his
form
was
undeniably
good
and
aglow
with
the
sense
of
reserve
force
he
now
faced
the
squarely
amused
as
he
caught
on
this
lip
and
on
that
comments
not
meant
for
his
hearing
not
bad
after
pretty
wasn
t
it
corking
good
knows
how
doesn
t
he
too
slick
to
others
followed
the
bar
went
up
nine
feet
nine
feet
three
varrell
who
had
three
inches
handicap
and
dearborn
scratch
man
were
now
alone
both
men
cleared
nine
feet
six
which
was
four
inches
higher
than
wrenn
had
ever
reached
at
nine
seven
he
failed
and
dearborn
just
touched
the
event
was
varrell
s
on
his
handicap
fine
wrenn
said
melvin
giving
his
hand
a
good
grip
as
he
sat
down
think
of
the
little
practice
you
ve
had
compared
with
dearborn
your
form
was
bully
too
and
that
s
important
for
improvement
in
pole
vaulting
oh
we
two
may
become
great
prize
winners
yet
here
goes
for
my
he
spoke
with
a
smile
on
his
lips
which
made
it
clear
that
his
last
words
were
uttered
in
jest
varrell
looked
after
him
rather
enviously
as
he
took
a
few
confident
steps
and
went
lightly
over
the
bar
at
its
first
position
melvin
did
not
need
to
consider
what
the
spectators
might
think
of
his
audacity
nor
to
struggle
to
make
a
name
for
himself
in
school
a
man
with
his
athletic
record
and
his
rank
and
his
general
influence
could
afford
to
speak
slightingly
of
a
prize
in
a
handicap
meeting
to
varrell
who
had
hardly
yet
divested
himself
of
the
notion
that
he
was
still
a
stranger
in
the
school
any
prize
that
gave
distinction
would
have
been
welcome
to
win
an
important
contest
to
make
a
place
for
himself
on
some
school
team
to
earn
and
wear
a
coveted
s
this
was
a
part
of
an
unconfessed
ambition
so
he
envied
dick
not
for
the
honors
which
he
had
won
but
for
the
ability
which
had
enabled
him
to
win
them
the
jump
took
its
wearisome
course
at
five
feet
the
contestants
began
to
drop
out
benson
the
scratch
man
and
melvin
were
alone
able
to
clear
five
feet
three
both
went
over
at
five
four
then
melvin
failed
and
benson
with
a
jump
two
inches
higher
won
first
place
another
middler
victory
growled
marks
whose
class
patriotism
was
strident
i
should
have
won
said
dick
contentedly
pulling
on
his
sweater
if
i
had
taken
the
three
inches
they
were
going
to
give
me
as
dickinson
and
i
did
the
handicapping
we
didn
t
want
to
be
charged
with
taking
any
unfair
advantage
and
so
put
ourselves
down
at
that
s
well
enough
for
dickinson
but
simply
suicide
for
you
you
re
just
learning
and
benson
s
been
at
it
ever
since
he
s
been
in
i
should
have
liked
to
see
him
do
six
feet
said
melvin
calmly
marks
muttered
something
unintelligible
and
turned
to
curtis
don
t
you
fail
us
anyway
curtis
nodded
and
grabbed
the
shot
his
first
put
was
close
to
the
record
his
second
touched
it
his
third
went
ten
inches
beyond
that
gave
him
a
new
record
and
the
event
and
put
marks
again
in
good
humor
john
curtis
is
the
man
for
my
money
as
i
ve
always
said
he
announced
significantly
to
melvin
he
never
goes
back
on
didn
t
varrell
and
dickinson
do
the
same
asked
melvin
amused
for
the
instant
at
the
peculiar
point
of
view
of
this
sport
who
was
always
prating
athletic
nonsense
and
swaggering
as
an
expert
answered
marks
unwillingly
but
dickinson
balked
in
the
six
hundred
it
s
all
due
to
his
folly
about
the
track
ends
they
wouldn
t
stop
him
if
he
wasn
t
a
look
of
indignation
swept
over
melvin
s
face
his
lips
parted
to
let
out
a
savage
retort
but
he
suddenly
checked
himself
gave
a
sniff
of
amused
contempt
and
replied
good
humoredly
really
marks
you
ought
to
write
a
book
on
athletics
to
leave
to
the
school
when
we
and
marks
went
off
furious
and
voluble
to
inform
his
listeners
that
melvin
s
athletic
successes
had
entirely
turned
his
head
the
fellow
was
really
nothing
but
a
big
chump
after
all
chapter
xiv
under
two
flags
for
an
hour
or
two
after
the
meeting
was
over
the
elated
middlers
made
a
good
deal
of
noise
with
their
yells
and
their
cheering
to
which
no
one
objected
except
those
who
happened
to
want
to
study
at
this
hour
later
a
few
leading
spirits
cast
about
for
some
more
striking
mode
of
proving
their
importance
than
the
threadbare
and
laborious
fashion
of
cheers
the
class
flag
which
the
seniors
following
a
precedent
had
displayed
on
the
academy
tower
very
early
on
washington
s
birthday
had
been
seasonably
and
ignominiously
removed
by
the
conscientious
boy
who
rang
the
academy
bell
the
middlers
concluded
that
the
cleverest
thing
for
them
would
be
to
hang
their
own
class
flag
aloft
on
the
day
when
the
school
was
to
break
up
for
the
spring
recess
following
wednesday
boys
are
proverbially
unskilled
in
keeping
secrets
by
monday
night
the
seniors
knew
of
the
middlers
plan
by
tuesday
night
the
middlers
knew
of
the
seniors
plan
which
was
of
course
to
anticipate
their
friends
on
wednesday
morning
and
have
the
senior
not
the
middler
banner
wave
a
farewell
to
the
scattering
school
the
middlers
then
advanced
the
execution
of
their
scheme
several
hours
early
tuesday
night
instead
of
wednesday
morning
a
daring
middler
tompkins
by
name
scaled
the
academy
roof
mounted
the
belfry
and
fixed
to
the
the
banner
of
his
class
then
sliding
down
the
again
to
the
main
roof
of
the
building
he
settled
himself
there
for
his
hour
s
vigil
report
of
this
forward
movement
of
the
enemy
was
brought
to
sands
s
room
early
in
the
evening
he
hastily
summoned
advisers
melvin
varrell
curtis
dickinson
waters
todd
and
others
whose
names
are
not
known
to
this
story
gathered
to
his
call
waters
proposed
to
storm
the
watch
immediately
change
flags
and
set
a
new
guard
melvin
and
varrell
objected
vigorously
to
the
plan
as
dangerous
and
foolhardy
and
apparently
were
supported
by
the
others
dickinson
then
suggested
that
the
wisest
course
would
be
to
leave
to
the
middlers
their
flag
their
and
their
victory
and
have
them
gloat
over
us
forever
afterward
said
sands
not
on
your
life
we
should
never
hear
the
last
of
it
said
todd
wondering
how
a
fellow
could
be
enough
to
suggest
such
a
course
dickinson
always
had
been
queer
marks
and
reynolds
now
joined
the
company
and
heard
a
report
of
proceedings
i
agree
with
dickinson
said
melvin
renewing
the
discussion
these
class
rows
are
dangerous
things
to
start
for
you
can
t
tell
what
the
end
will
be
if
we
take
down
the
middlers
flag
and
put
ours
up
the
middlers
will
set
their
hearts
on
getting
back
at
us
and
then
the
thing
will
seesaw
back
and
forth
until
there
s
serious
trouble
we
had
a
good
example
of
that
last
year
when
martin
and
his
gang
stopped
the
if
we
let
them
get
ahead
of
us
in
this
they
ll
be
encouraged
to
try
something
else
remarked
curtis
hit
em
when
you
can
i
say
only
be
sure
you
don
t
miss
it
s
worse
to
try
and
fail
than
not
to
try
at
and
on
the
other
hand
put
in
varrell
quietly
if
you
let
them
entirely
alone
and
pay
no
attention
at
all
to
their
doings
they
will
find
no
special
credit
in
the
thing
the
easiest
way
to
beat
them
is
to
let
them
what
a
sandless
lot
exclaimed
marks
in
disgust
why
don
t
you
come
out
square
and
say
you
re
afraid
to
do
it
shut
up
marks
ordered
sands
or
you
ll
get
into
a
valiant
man
like
marks
might
do
it
alone
said
melvin
stretching
himself
as
he
rose
to
his
feet
i
shouldn
t
think
of
interfering
with
his
opportunity
well
good
night
all
i
m
going
home
to
varrell
and
dickinson
joined
him
at
the
door
curtis
started
to
follow
but
a
significant
wink
from
sands
detained
him
good
night
he
called
after
them
i
guess
i
won
t
go
just
tompkins
sat
on
the
academy
roof
in
coat
and
gloves
waiting
and
musing
and
shivering
the
night
was
clear
and
moonless
the
day
had
been
warm
it
was
freezing
again
now
at
eleven
he
heard
below
the
welcome
call
of
benson
the
relieving
watch
and
scuttled
down
to
the
ground
as
fast
as
his
cold
hands
and
stiff
legs
would
allow
at
twelve
o
clock
bosworth
took
his
turn
he
got
up
with
some
difficulty
as
he
was
little
used
to
climbing
and
pulled
up
after
him
by
a
string
a
voluminous
ulster
borrowed
of
a
larger
classmate
in
which
he
rolled
himself
snugly
as
he
crouched
at
the
base
of
the
belfry
where
the
reached
up
its
side
to
the
above
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
complete
silence
reigned
then
the
lone
watcher
became
conscious
of
vague
noises
underneath
now
at
the
side
now
in
front
with
heart
beating
in
quick
heavy
thumps
he
freed
himself
from
the
ulster
and
crept
around
the
belfry
to
the
ridgepole
that
ran
toward
the
front
of
the
building
and
along
this
to
the
peak
of
the
gable
projecting
his
head
carefully
over
he
heard
voices
first
indistinct
then
somewhat
clearer
illustration
he
heard
voices
first
indistinct
then
somewhat
whatever
the
unknown
persons
were
doing
they
were
very
deliberate
in
their
movements
minutes
had
passed
before
he
made
out
figures
on
the
roof
of
the
porch
below
they
waited
here
and
spent
more
time
in
muffled
conversation
apparently
discussing
the
method
of
scaling
the
wall
above
which
as
bosworth
said
to
himself
reassuringly
again
and
again
as
he
clung
shivering
to
the
cold
slates
was
unscalable
at
last
the
frost
penetrated
to
his
bones
making
it
obviously
dangerous
to
lie
longer
in
his
cramped
position
he
was
just
about
to
grope
his
way
back
to
his
warm
coat
when
the
figures
on
the
porch
began
to
be
active
again
he
heard
sounded
like
curtis
s
i
say
we
can
t
do
it
we
may
as
well
go
home
as
freeze
a
few
minutes
later
the
speakers
seemed
to
be
on
the
ground
again
presently
their
voices
were
lost
in
the
sound
of
feet
treading
carefully
the
board
walk
that
led
to
the
street
soon
these
sounds
too
had
died
away
and
absolute
stillness
reigned
again
numb
with
cold
bosworth
crept
back
to
his
nook
and
wrapped
himself
once
more
in
the
great
coat
which
he
found
in
a
heap
by
the
foot
of
the
he
was
puzzled
at
this
for
he
had
a
distinct
impression
of
crawling
out
of
the
coat
as
a
worm
out
of
a
cocoon
and
leaving
it
spread
on
the
roof
behind
him
it
s
a
vile
job
anyway
he
groaned
and
i
was
a
fool
to
let
them
drag
me
into
it
i
shall
freeze
to
death
but
the
hour
was
nearly
over
he
was
just
falling
into
a
risky
doze
when
dearborn
s
call
came
up
from
below
and
presently
dearborn
himself
startled
him
by
appearing
suddenly
at
the
edge
of
the
roof
all
right
up
here
asked
the
newcomer
i
suppose
so
grumbled
bosworth
if
you
can
call
it
all
right
to
have
your
legs
and
arms
frozen
seen
anything
or
heard
anything
bosworth
hesitated
the
instructions
of
the
leaders
had
been
definite
signal
at
the
first
suspicious
sound
when
the
voices
aroused
him
his
first
impulse
had
been
to
give
the
preconcerted
signal
but
fear
of
being
made
the
centre
of
a
scuffle
on
the
roof
or
of
being
compelled
to
hold
the
fort
at
the
foot
of
the
until
classmates
gathered
to
the
rescue
had
kept
his
lips
sealed
well
what
s
the
matter
with
you
snapped
dearborn
didn
t
you
hear
what
i
said
you
act
as
if
you
were
no
not
a
it
seems
to
take
a
long
time
to
get
it
bosworth
roused
himself
when
you
ve
been
freezing
as
long
as
i
have
you
won
t
be
so
anxious
to
talk
give
me
the
coat
then
replied
dearborn
grabbing
it
without
more
ado
you
can
have
it
in
the
morning
now
clear
out
and
go
to
bed
this
is
the
hour
when
they
come
if
they
come
at
so
the
watch
changed
hourly
through
the
still
cold
night
the
last
man
aloft
descended
at
six
just
as
the
sun
was
peeping
above
the
horizon
the
cooks
were
already
hard
at
work
in
the
big
kitchen
of
carter
hall
soon
the
boys
who
cared
for
the
yard
would
be
at
their
early
tasks
and
with
the
dormitories
gradually
waking
it
was
no
longer
advisable
to
maintain
the
sentinel
on
the
roof
halfway
between
the
academy
and
carter
the
retiring
guard
met
his
two
successors
who
were
to
continue
the
watch
between
six
and
seven
from
the
concealment
of
the
gymnasium
porch
together
the
three
looked
proudly
up
at
the
bunch
of
white
that
hung
limp
between
the
east
and
north
arms
of
the
academy
there
she
is
all
right
said
strout
with
the
first
puff
of
wind
she
ll
blow
out
and
show
at
seven
the
watch
was
last
watch
not
a
senior
had
appeared
the
middlers
breakfasted
early
then
hung
round
the
steps
of
carter
waiting
for
the
chapel
bell
it
s
coming
cried
dearborn
holding
up
his
finger
in
joyful
anticipation
and
at
the
right
time
too
see
the
bend
just
as
the
dismal
clang
of
the
bell
sounded
out
its
first
summons
when
the
boys
slowly
sauntering
forth
from
dormitory
entries
were
lazily
reckoning
up
the
minutes
of
liberty
left
to
them
before
the
final
fatal
stroke
should
cut
off
their
entrance
into
chapel
the
breeze
struck
the
filled
out
the
folds
of
the
flag
and
set
it
flapping
vigorously
three
long
seatons
for
the
middle
class
shouted
strout
leaping
out
from
the
waiting
group
with
cap
in
hand
make
it
good
now
one
two
a
groan
from
behind
stopped
him
suddenly
the
breeze
had
strengthened
the
white
flag
was
exposed
in
its
full
length
and
breadth
and
it
bore
the
numerals
not
of
the
middle
but
of
the
senior
class
some
mistake
about
that
flag
isn
t
there
strout
rang
out
curtis
s
voice
from
the
steps
you
must
have
got
a
blind
man
to
put
that
strout
returned
neither
look
nor
word
but
he
collared
every
sentinel
before
the
first
recitation
and
him
thoroughly
every
one
including
bosworth
swore
that
he
had
watched
honestly
and
intently
at
the
beside
the
belfry
during
his
whole
hour
and
had
heard
nothing
every
one
except
bosworth
told
the
truth
chapter
xv
about
many
things
who
did
it
dick
asked
phil
later
in
the
day
when
the
flag
had
been
taken
down
said
and
the
dormitories
emptied
of
those
who
were
fortunate
enough
to
be
within
easy
distance
of
home
had
ceased
to
resemble
an
anthill
in
its
busy
season
i
don
t
know
replied
dick
i
can
guess
and
that
s
the
fellows
say
curtis
and
sands
were
at
the
bottom
of
it
it
seems
rather
silly
business
for
such
big
fellows
doesn
t
it
dick
laughed
two
seasons
of
rubbing
against
the
varieties
of
seaton
life
had
not
shaken
poole
s
respect
for
proprieties
or
affected
his
natural
dignity
what
a
venerable
person
you
are
sometimes
you
seem
the
oldest
of
us
all
how
old
are
you
anyway
i
m
fifteen
and
a
half
replied
poole
i
wish
i
seemed
old
to
sands
he
added
mournfully
perhaps
he
d
give
me
a
little
better
show
if
i
did
he
always
acts
as
if
i
were
a
never
mind
how
he
acts
said
melvin
make
him
take
you
whether
he
wants
to
or
not
study
your
game
and
hang
on
till
the
last
gun
is
i
can
t
very
well
hang
on
after
he
s
kicked
me
off
said
phil
with
a
melancholy
smile
has
he
done
that
not
yet
it
may
be
coming
though
when
practice
begins
after
vacation
the
coach
will
be
here
the
senior
leaned
back
in
his
desk
chair
with
hands
clasped
behind
his
head
and
gazed
long
and
vacantly
out
of
the
window
at
the
bare
limbs
and
solid
trunks
that
lined
the
distant
street
you
ll
make
it
sometime
i
m
sure
phil
for
i
think
you
have
it
in
you
and
if
you
want
it
hard
enough
you
ll
put
it
through
the
only
question
in
my
mind
is
whether
it
will
come
this
year
or
later
you
have
to
get
a
start
and
the
start
often
depends
on
luck
i
got
on
the
football
team
the
first
year
through
a
lucky
you
had
something
better
than
luck
to
help
you
rejoined
phil
you
had
ability
and
luck
and
energy
were
all
i
had
to
start
with
returned
dick
modestly
the
ability
came
gradually
from
experience
and
i
don
t
think
i
used
my
brains
until
i
took
up
both
were
silent
for
a
time
each
intent
on
his
own
thoughts
then
the
older
boy
began
again
look
here
phil
i
ll
tell
you
something
that
i
m
beginning
to
get
hold
of
which
isn
t
to
be
got
from
any
book
and
yet
is
a
fundamental
principle
of
athletics
in
every
exercise
that
requires
a
skilled
motion
or
great
speed
you
ll
find
that
there
s
a
peculiar
kind
of
final
snap
or
twist
that
gives
the
motion
or
the
speed
and
you
ve
got
to
master
this
if
you
want
the
highest
results
without
it
a
strong
man
is
powerless
and
with
it
a
weak
man
often
slips
to
the
front
in
punting
it
s
the
final
jerk
of
the
knee
which
i
had
so
much
trouble
in
t
worry
i
m
not
going
to
begin
on
that
again
in
golf
it
s
a
snap
of
the
wrist
in
of
the
arm
and
shoulder
in
pole
vaulting
of
the
waist
and
arms
so
on
through
the
list
in
gymnasium
feats
the
same
principle
works
just
watch
guy
morgan
when
he
does
the
giant
swing
on
the
horizontal
bar
and
you
ll
see
that
he
gives
a
sudden
jerk
with
his
shoulders
when
he
s
about
round
that
carries
him
up
to
the
top
of
the
swing
like
a
hawk
rising
at
the
end
of
a
swoop
now
in
baseball
i
believe
that
snap
is
hidden
somewhere
in
every
good
throw
and
in
every
straight
swing
of
the
bat
discover
it
and
master
it
and
you
won
t
need
to
worry
about
making
the
school
i
suppose
that
explains
how
some
of
these
fine
hitters
seem
to
strike
easily
and
yet
make
the
ball
fly
remarked
phil
can
t
you
get
a
lot
of
batting
practice
this
vacation
and
so
start
in
a
little
ahead
when
the
others
get
back
i
ll
pitch
for
you
if
you
want
me
to
it
will
be
good
phil
smiled
i
m
afraid
you
wouldn
t
be
of
much
use
i
ought
to
have
some
one
who
really
knows
how
to
that
s
a
fact
rejoined
melvin
and
i
can
t
pitch
at
all
couldn
t
we
scare
up
some
one
did
you
ever
hear
of
a
man
named
rowley
who
used
to
play
professional
ball
he
works
in
one
of
the
factories
now
i
believe
he
was
something
of
a
pitcher
before
he
broke
down
why
shouldn
t
i
be
able
to
get
him
to
pitch
for
me
just
the
man
cried
dick
briskly
let
s
hunt
him
up
right
the
boys
finally
succeeded
in
locating
the
residence
of
the
rowley
family
and
caught
their
man
smoking
his
pipe
before
the
door
he
was
a
sallow
person
with
a
goodly
length
of
arms
and
legs
strung
to
a
lanky
body
by
stout
joints
are
you
jack
rowley
the
asked
phil
the
man
removed
the
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
looked
at
the
boys
with
interest
he
admitted
that
he
was
jack
rowley
but
denied
being
a
he
had
been
once
but
wasn
t
any
longer
you
could
still
pitch
a
little
couldn
t
you
asked
dick
a
couple
of
innings
perhaps
answered
rowley
but
i
m
not
up
to
a
game
i
ve
been
out
of
it
these
three
years
what
d
ye
want
of
me
i
want
some
practice
in
batting
said
phil
and
i
thought
i
might
be
able
to
get
you
to
pitch
for
me
half
an
hour
a
day
for
the
next
rowley
shook
his
head
i
m
in
the
mill
all
day
from
seven
till
six
except
for
the
hour
s
nooning
which
i
want
to
myself
and
to
eat
my
dinner
in
peace
and
how
about
after
supper
questioned
phil
it
s
dark
after
supper
grumbled
rowley
through
the
phil
looked
at
dick
in
discouragement
suddenly
his
face
lighted
up
why
not
before
breakfast
he
said
say
from
six
to
it
s
only
for
a
week
and
i
ll
pay
you
anything
that
s
will
you
buy
me
a
new
arm
to
pitch
with
asked
rowley
with
a
rueful
grin
mine
is
all
wrenched
to
pieces
with
them
cussed
isn
t
there
enough
of
it
left
to
give
this
boy
a
week
s
batting
practice
asked
melvin
anxious
to
secure
the
opportunity
i
ll
shack
the
there
mightn
t
be
many
to
shack
said
rowley
with
a
gleam
of
fun
in
his
eyes
he
pondered
some
time
puffing
vigorously
and
shooting
an
occasional
side
glance
at
the
waiting
boy
well
i
ll
try
it
once
he
said
finally
but
mind
ye
if
me
arm
hurts
i
ll
not
do
it
no
for
ten
dollars
an
hour
i
was
laid
up
a
year
with
it
once
and
that
s
enough
for
the
boys
had
to
turn
out
early
next
morning
to
keep
their
appointment
at
the
practice
ground
and
they
more
than
half
expected
to
find
that
they
alone
kept
it
but
rowley
was
there
he
received
them
as
before
with
his
pipe
between
his
lips
but
after
a
few
throws
into
the
net
he
put
the
pipe
away
as
he
warmed
up
his
thoughts
returned
to
old
channels
and
with
his
shoots
and
drops
he
interlarded
anecdotes
of
games
and
bits
of
shrewd
counsel
he
was
unquestionably
wild
that
first
morning
and
phil
s
practice
was
rather
in
waiting
and
dodging
and
facing
courageously
than
in
picking
out
good
balls
i
ll
steady
down
in
a
day
or
two
he
said
as
he
pulled
on
his
coat
at
the
end
of
the
half
hour
so
the
boys
knew
that
he
had
not
thrown
up
the
job
the
next
day
the
pitching
was
better
and
the
batting
worse
it
was
not
so
easy
to
watch
the
ball
when
it
took
such
sudden
unexpected
dives
still
phil
occasionally
met
them
fairly
and
each
square
hit
gave
him
courage
to
wait
for
another
after
a
time
jack
suggested
trying
bunts
it
s
a
great
thing
for
a
to
be
able
to
bunt
he
said
he
has
twice
the
chance
to
make
first
on
one
that
a
and
phil
tried
this
too
with
questionable
success
day
followed
day
and
rowley
improved
more
than
phil
so
that
the
progress
of
the
latter
did
not
show
itself
i
d
like
to
have
you
for
a
month
said
the
pitcher
as
they
settled
their
account
at
the
end
of
the
week
i
could
teach
you
to
bunt
in
a
few
lessons
and
it
s
a
great
thing
to
be
a
good
phil
laughed
you
ve
said
that
fifty
times
i
want
to
be
able
to
do
something
besides
bunt
all
the
same
i
d
like
to
have
you
pitch
for
me
once
or
twice
a
week
rowley
can
you
do
it
sure
said
rowley
but
take
my
advice
and
learn
to
the
boys
came
trooping
back
for
the
final
stretch
of
the
year
the
baseball
candidate
went
to
work
as
the
field
was
still
soft
the
had
for
the
first
time
the
chief
attention
of
coach
and
captain
and
phil
was
sent
chasing
flies
and
long
hits
with
the
rest
he
fared
as
well
as
the
others
perhaps
though
his
eye
was
not
yet
to
be
trusted
and
he
was
nervous
with
an
intense
desire
to
do
well
they
all
came
up
for
batting
practice
later
on
and
phil
found
the
pitcher
rather
an
easy
mark
after
facing
rowley
he
cracked
out
several
easy
chances
in
what
seemed
to
him
a
thorough
sort
of
way
but
to
his
disappointment
neither
sands
nor
coach
lyford
appeared
to
notice
them
that
same
day
melvin
and
varrell
walked
down
from
their
first
practice
together
how
about
the
safe
robbery
wrenn
said
melvin
peering
laughingly
into
his
companion
s
face
it
seems
to
me
i
haven
t
heard
much
about
that
of
late
given
it
up
as
a
bad
job
haven
t
you
no
i
haven
t
replied
varrell
composedly
i
m
just
it
s
easy
enough
to
wait
i
could
do
that
myself
i
thought
you
were
going
to
do
i
have
done
one
thing
rejoined
the
imperturbable
wrenn
what
i
ve
proved
that
the
passage
door
can
be
opened
by
prying
with
the
how
by
opening
the
door
with
it
myself
you
know
that
room
wasn
t
meant
for
a
permanent
office
when
it
was
first
enclosed
the
whole
partition
is
more
or
less
i
don
t
see
that
that
helps
you
much
you
have
no
evidence
against
any
particular
the
evidence
will
come
in
time
that
s
what
i
m
waiting
where
from
i
d
like
to
know
perhaps
from
eddy
he
must
know
more
than
he
s
told
he
certainly
lied
to
grim
and
i
don
t
believe
bosworth
would
trust
anything
to
a
little
fool
like
him
said
dick
eddy
apparently
told
bosworth
the
combination
and
then
when
the
news
of
the
robbery
came
out
was
too
scared
to
acknowledge
it
having
once
lied
he
would
stick
to
it
because
to
such
a
little
morally
flabby
idiot
it
would
seem
the
easiest
and
even
if
he
confessed
it
wouldn
t
help
matters
went
on
varrell
following
out
the
argument
for
bosworth
would
deny
that
he
had
paid
any
attention
to
what
eddy
said
and
there
would
be
the
end
of
it
no
we
ve
got
to
get
the
information
from
bosworth
are
you
going
to
tackle
him
with
it
outright
demanded
dick
perplexed
varrell
snorted
in
disgust
what
a
question
of
course
i
m
not
i
m
going
to
wait
as
i
said
before
this
bosworth
lives
in
cambridge
his
mother
keeps
a
for
students
he
s
been
thrown
with
these
fellows
some
of
them
probably
fast
men
with
plenty
of
money
who
have
patronized
him
and
unintentionally
filled
his
head
with
all
sorts
of
wrong
ideas
he
s
learned
to
play
poker
and
like
fine
clothes
and
spend
money
on
himself
and
feel
that
to
have
money
is
to
be
happy
and
to
be
without
it
is
to
be
wretched
whatever
he
had
left
from
the
plunder
of
the
safe
he
probably
spent
during
the
vacation
he
told
marks
of
several
things
he
d
done
that
must
have
taken
money
he
ll
soon
be
in
need
of
more
this
is
an
expensive
term
for
those
of
us
who
have
good
allowances
with
subscription
duns
and
summer
clothes
to
buy
and
all
sorts
of
temptations
to
spend
money
it
will
be
harder
for
him
as
he
ll
come
back
without
much
cash
and
will
want
to
guzzle
and
smoke
and
perhaps
try
to
worm
himself
into
some
society
i
know
such
a
fellow
like
a
book
he
s
got
to
have
money
and
he
ll
get
it
dishonestly
if
he
can
t
honestly
his
success
with
the
safe
will
encourage
him
to
something
to
what
asked
dick
how
do
i
know
that
s
what
i
m
waiting
to
chapter
xvi
phil
makes
his
début
one
strike
called
the
umpire
phil
gripped
the
bat
and
waited
it
was
the
first
practice
game
the
scrub
against
the
school
phil
had
been
put
at
on
the
scrub
and
he
was
now
at
bat
nervously
conscious
that
it
was
his
first
real
trial
perhaps
his
only
one
and
that
sands
was
waiting
for
the
pretext
to
fire
him
with
the
first
batch
of
disappointed
candidates
tompkins
was
also
on
trial
and
while
he
rubbed
the
damp
ball
into
a
state
to
grip
decently
for
the
next
pitch
he
considered
whether
he
could
afford
to
give
the
youngster
an
easy
one
to
help
him
out
without
interfering
with
his
own
reputation
then
he
caught
sands
s
signal
as
the
crouching
catcher
wagged
his
hand
between
his
knees
and
answered
it
with
an
no
there
was
no
place
in
the
seaton
game
for
favoritism
the
boy
must
take
his
chance
phil
s
bat
came
almost
to
the
plate
but
he
stopped
it
short
at
the
first
veer
of
the
ball
he
had
learned
from
wallace
to
watch
the
ball
but
it
was
rowley
who
had
taught
him
to
detect
the
first
sign
of
the
veer
one
ball
shouted
the
umpire
the
next
one
was
an
out
meant
to
swing
over
the
plate
it
swung
too
far
and
phil
had
to
dodge
to
save
himself
but
he
did
it
easily
stepping
back
just
far
enough
to
avoid
the
ball
there
was
no
sign
of
fear
in
the
movement
hang
a
muttered
tompkins
and
sent
a
straight
ball
over
the
corner
of
the
plate
a
little
below
the
shoulder
with
the
instinct
of
a
real
phil
knew
his
ball
and
met
it
squarely
dropped
the
bat
and
scampered
for
first
he
perceived
as
he
ran
that
the
second
baseman
jumped
for
it
and
missed
it
and
a
moment
later
as
he
touched
first
he
saw
the
stoop
and
then
turn
and
run
he
did
not
need
the
coacher
s
advice
to
go
down
by
the
time
the
got
his
hands
on
the
ball
the
runner
was
already
beyond
second
he
slid
to
third
with
a
fine
dive
the
prettiness
of
which
was
not
spoiled
by
the
fact
that
the
slide
was
wholly
unnecessary
at
third
he
waited
while
the
three
men
who
followed
him
at
bat
went
out
in
quick
succession
two
as
victims
of
strikes
tempted
to
hit
at
balls
they
didn
t
want
and
one
on
a
pop
fly
sands
threw
down
his
mask
and
protector
and
joined
the
coach
that
hit
of
poole
s
was
the
second
made
off
tompkins
in
five
innings
said
the
coach
a
pretty
hit
and
a
good
slide
too
bad
he
s
so
young
for
he
seems
about
the
only
man
on
your
scrub
team
who
stands
up
to
the
plate
and
keeps
his
head
he
s
been
up
twice
the
first
time
he
got
his
base
on
balls
the
second
he
made
a
he
s
doing
better
than
i
expected
said
sands
probably
it
s
his
lucky
day
but
he
s
too
light
and
too
green
for
us
he
ll
make
good
material
for
about
two
years
from
now
we
must
have
steady
men
for
the
hillbury
game
or
they
ll
go
to
pieces
the
strain
s
he
s
had
two
fielding
chances
with
one
error
said
the
coach
consulting
his
record
oh
yes
i
remember
the
error
was
on
a
long
hit
close
by
the
foul
line
but
he
got
it
back
well
to
the
in
the
sixth
inning
robinson
second
baseman
on
the
first
team
led
off
with
a
single
over
third
maine
who
was
being
tried
at
short
followed
with
a
hot
grounder
to
which
the
let
bounce
past
him
allowing
the
batsman
to
reach
second
and
advancing
robinson
to
third
and
sands
followed
with
a
liner
over
the
s
head
that
set
the
runners
moving
again
by
some
unaccountable
certainly
had
not
seen
enough
of
sands
s
playing
to
know
the
general
direction
of
his
had
moved
up
toward
the
suddenly
he
heard
the
crack
of
the
bat
and
saw
the
ball
shooting
straight
toward
him
apparently
likely
to
strike
a
dozen
yards
ahead
impulse
drove
him
forward
to
meet
it
intelligence
with
tardier
admonition
held
him
back
so
he
took
a
step
forward
then
several
back
and
just
reached
the
ball
as
it
skimmed
above
his
head
and
pulled
it
down
it
was
a
creditable
catch
but
more
creditable
still
was
the
unhesitating
accurate
throw
to
rhines
at
third
to
cut
off
robinson
who
had
started
for
home
for
it
was
proof
that
the
boy
could
think
quickly
and
take
advantage
of
the
chances
of
the
game
whatever
the
merit
of
quick
thought
rhines
evidently
lacked
it
for
he
stupidly
held
the
ball
on
third
without
perceiving
that
the
other
was
thirty
feet
from
second
and
might
have
been
caught
equally
well
smith
who
was
pitching
finally
made
it
clear
to
him
with
expletives
and
yells
but
the
opportunity
for
the
triple
play
had
passed
vincent
went
out
on
a
pop
fly
to
the
pitcher
and
the
scrub
came
in
triumphant
the
coach
made
another
mental
note
in
phil
s
favor
a
catch
may
be
by
chance
a
double
play
never
it
was
no
great
feat
but
the
boy
could
use
his
brains
that
was
worth
remembering
phil
s
side
went
out
readily
enough
one
hitting
to
pitcher
one
on
a
little
fly
to
second
one
on
strikes
the
first
followed
in
similar
fashion
and
the
scrub
in
their
turn
advanced
no
farther
than
second
it
was
still
early
in
the
season
and
schoolboys
are
likely
to
be
poor
batters
the
pitchers
were
the
only
men
who
had
had
any
regular
practice
for
their
positions
then
with
the
return
of
the
first
to
bat
came
a
set
of
fumbles
and
wild
throws
and
general
heedless
passing
of
the
ball
around
the
diamond
that
set
the
first
to
running
recklessly
and
drove
the
scrub
to
wilder
errors
such
practice
is
as
vicious
for
and
coachers
as
for
fielders
stop
stop
cried
lyford
running
out
into
the
diamond
the
scrub
had
fumbled
a
grounder
and
then
after
juggling
the
ball
a
second
had
thrown
to
first
when
it
was
quite
impossible
to
catch
the
man
the
first
baseman
had
put
it
frantically
across
the
diamond
to
rhines
six
feet
off
the
base
in
a
wild
attempt
to
catch
a
runner
at
third
and
rhines
had
made
haste
to
contribute
his
part
to
the
general
demoralization
by
throwing
several
feet
over
the
second
baseman
s
head
in
an
equally
hopeless
effort
to
intercept
the
man
speeding
down
to
second
give
that
ball
to
the
pitcher
shouted
the
coach
as
the
ball
finally
came
back
from
the
distant
and
don
t
do
any
more
of
this
reckless
tossing
round
the
diamond
until
you
can
throw
the
ball
straight
don
t
throw
it
and
never
throw
unless
you
know
what
you
re
trying
to
the
scrub
steadied
down
and
put
three
men
out
including
taylor
the
being
struck
out
by
smith
and
the
other
sending
an
easy
fly
to
the
rhines
then
made
a
hit
for
the
scrub
stole
second
and
was
pushed
on
to
third
by
an
out
newcomb
sent
an
easy
fly
to
taylor
and
phil
came
up
to
bat
with
two
men
out
and
rhines
on
third
this
time
tompkins
had
no
question
as
to
the
youngster
phil
struck
once
had
two
balls
and
a
strike
called
on
him
and
then
just
holding
the
bat
to
meet
the
ball
and
drawing
it
a
little
back
rather
than
striking
dropped
a
pretty
bunt
near
the
between
third
and
home
and
easily
beat
the
ball
to
first
with
rhines
on
third
the
boy
stole
second
without
fear
and
then
as
smith
sent
a
bounder
to
he
was
off
with
the
sharp
start
rounded
third
at
full
speed
and
came
racing
over
the
plate
just
before
the
ball
reached
the
catcher
s
hands
an
easy
strike
out
sent
the
scrub
for
the
last
time
into
the
field
phil
ran
out
to
his
place
with
a
heart
throbbing
with
joyful
exhilaration
he
had
reached
first
every
time
he
had
come
to
bat
on
balls
once
on
a
genuine
hit
once
on
a
successful
bunt
his
fielding
chances
had
been
at
least
decently
good
he
had
caught
two
flies
made
one
assist
and
there
was
but
one
error
against
him
there
was
certainly
nothing
here
to
be
ashamed
of
the
first
of
the
school
batters
went
out
on
an
easy
fly
the
second
reached
first
safely
through
an
error
by
the
fumbling
short
the
third
got
his
base
on
balls
and
the
fourth
hit
to
filling
the
bases
phil
pulled
his
cap
down
tight
over
his
head
blew
on
his
fingers
to
keep
them
warm
and
pondered
what
he
should
do
with
the
ball
if
a
fly
came
into
his
hands
tompkins
came
up
to
the
plate
line
it
out
tommy
cried
sands
a
hit
means
two
runs
a
two
bagger
three
one
ball
one
strike
tompkins
set
his
teeth
and
smashed
at
what
he
thought
to
be
his
chance
he
hit
hard
but
he
hit
a
trifle
under
and
the
ball
went
up
up
up
going
it
seemed
to
phil
as
if
it
never
would
stop
the
staggered
back
with
his
eyes
on
the
ball
but
it
was
out
of
reach
behind
him
i
ll
take
it
shouted
phil
he
ran
hard
forward
then
looked
up
and
waited
how
it
wabbled
how
it
swung
how
it
changed
its
size
in
the
air
he
cleared
his
eyes
with
a
wink
the
next
instant
the
ball
was
in
his
hands
a
moment
only
he
staggered
for
better
footing
then
as
he
saw
the
runner
cut
loose
from
third
and
dash
for
the
home
he
set
himself
for
a
throw
the
catcher
stood
on
the
plate
and
waited
dutifully
but
hopelessly
ready
to
leap
to
either
side
for
the
wild
throw
from
the
field
to
his
surprise
he
did
not
need
to
stir
from
his
tracks
the
ball
came
directly
toward
him
long
straight
line
throw
an
easy
bound
and
landed
in
his
hands
just
as
the
runner
came
within
reach
out
cried
the
umpire
by
a
mile
added
tompkins
under
his
breath
bully
for
the
kid
that
s
a
throw
a
professional
wouldn
t
be
ashamed
during
the
last
half
of
the
ninth
phil
sat
on
the
bench
enjoying
the
compliments
of
his
associates
and
cared
not
a
whit
whether
the
scrub
batters
reached
first
or
not
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
went
out
as
quickly
and
easily
as
three
timid
batters
could
go
and
phil
his
ears
tingling
with
a
commendation
from
sands
and
a
warning
from
the
coach
as
to
taking
care
of
himself
after
the
game
that
was
more
delightfully
significant
than
the
captain
s
good
word
trotted
gayly
down
to
the
gymnasium
for
his
bath
and
and
a
change
of
clothes
half
an
hour
later
he
rushed
in
on
melvin
who
had
just
come
in
from
a
trip
up
the
river
in
varrell
s
canoe
what
luck
phil
luck
indeed
nothing
but
luck
i
helped
in
two
double
plays
caught
two
flies
made
two
hits
and
only
one
error
lyford
was
cordial
and
even
sands
gave
me
a
that
a
record
you
remember
what
i
said
about
my
getting
a
start
by
luck
you
ve
beaten
me
in
luck
the
boy
s
face
fell
but
you
got
on
the
team
and
i
shan
t
that
s
the
difference
sands
thinks
i
m
too
young
and
it
will
make
no
difference
whether
i
play
well
or
not
he
won
t
take
me
has
he
told
you
so
no
but
i
suspect
it
and
i
m
pretty
sure
i
m
nonsense
said
melvin
he
ll
take
you
if
you
re
the
best
man
or
i
don
t
know
sands
only
bear
in
mind
that
you
ve
had
a
lucky
day
and
the
first
practice
game
isn
t
enough
to
prove
anything
you
ve
won
the
first
heat
but
don
t
get
a
swelled
head
over
it
or
you
ll
win
no
at
the
same
time
sands
and
coach
lyford
were
lingering
on
the
gymnasium
steps
in
the
midst
of
a
conversation
on
the
very
same
subject
the
little
chap
did
well
sands
was
saying
i
don
t
dispute
that
he
s
a
clever
little
player
what
we
want
is
a
player
a
hard
experienced
steady
man
who
can
swat
the
ball
for
two
or
three
bases
when
he
hits
it
and
can
stand
the
strain
of
the
season
without
going
up
in
the
i
d
rather
have
a
man
that
can
hit
often
than
one
who
sometimes
hits
hard
replied
the
coach
and
as
for
throwing
give
me
brains
and
skill
rather
than
muscle
behind
a
ball
any
time
there
is
good
baseball
in
the
boy
and
you
ought
not
to
discourage
him
i
don
t
ask
you
to
put
him
on
the
team
keep
him
as
substitute
if
you
wish
but
watch
him
and
help
him
and
see
what
you
can
make
of
so
it
happened
that
phil
was
retained
as
substitute
when
the
great
majority
of
the
candidates
were
dropped
some
said
he
ought
to
be
on
the
team
some
that
it
was
gross
favoritism
not
to
fire
him
with
the
rest
but
phil
himself
was
content
to
sit
and
watch
and
do
what
he
was
told
and
play
when
he
had
a
chance
with
all
the
earnestness
and
strength
and
skill
he
had
and
twice
a
week
he
turned
out
early
for
the
six
o
clock
practice
with
rowley
chapter
xvii
a
nocturnal
mystery
for
weeks
phil
sat
on
the
bench
a
perpetual
substitute
getting
plenty
of
practice
on
practice
days
in
all
sorts
of
positions
where
he
was
useful
but
always
seeing
others
go
into
the
game
the
fielders
that
year
were
a
remarkably
healthy
lot
they
played
game
after
game
without
accident
or
illness
taylor
whose
position
at
phil
coveted
was
playing
his
second
year
on
the
team
and
felt
his
importance
as
a
veteran
who
had
already
been
tested
under
fire
in
a
hillbury
game
he
had
the
name
of
being
a
great
hitter
and
though
his
work
during
the
season
so
far
had
not
borne
out
this
reputation
he
occasionally
made
long
drives
that
delighted
the
great
mass
of
student
supporters
whose
admiration
is
as
intense
as
it
is
fitful
he
was
a
safe
catch
on
flies
and
now
and
then
did
spectacular
feats
that
had
the
same
effect
on
the
spectators
as
the
occasional
he
had
also
acquired
a
striking
way
of
opening
his
hands
for
the
ball
which
his
admirers
called
an
awfully
graceful
catch
and
he
took
much
apparent
satisfaction
in
his
general
bearing
and
clothes
the
other
fielders
vincent
at
right
and
sudbury
at
centre
were
steady
fellows
who
did
their
duty
at
bat
and
in
the
field
to
the
best
of
their
ability
and
did
not
know
or
care
whether
any
one
looked
at
them
or
not
curtis
sat
watching
the
play
one
saturday
afternoon
with
marks
on
the
seat
beside
him
emitting
deep
gulps
of
cigarette
smoke
and
the
usual
unbroken
stream
of
baseball
chatter
it
was
a
game
with
a
team
from
one
of
the
smaller
colleges
which
had
defeated
hillbury
eight
to
four
and
was
now
threatening
to
shut
seaton
out
altogether
what
a
fool
that
taylor
is
said
curtis
he
s
just
struck
out
again
and
now
pretends
the
umpire
is
unfair
that
s
to
save
his
face
i
wonder
why
sands
doesn
t
try
some
other
some
other
man
cried
marks
for
a
brief
instant
speechless
with
astonishment
why
he
made
a
home
run
in
the
colby
game
and
he
s
about
the
prettiest
fielder
on
the
oh
yes
he
s
pretty
enough
returned
curtis
and
knows
it
too
but
i
d
have
some
other
quality
than
prettiness
on
the
field
if
the
team
were
well
he
gets
the
balls
s
the
main
thing
said
marks
you
ll
find
few
errors
against
his
do
you
know
why
returned
curtis
he
never
tries
for
a
ball
unless
he
s
sure
he
can
get
it
it
s
easy
enough
to
get
a
fielding
record
when
you
never
take
any
hard
but
he
does
insisted
marks
don
t
you
remember
the
long
running
catch
he
made
in
the
musgrove
school
game
yes
i
do
replied
curtis
and
he
held
the
ball
admiring
himself
for
four
seconds
afterward
and
let
the
man
on
third
walk
you
re
down
on
him
said
marks
not
knowing
what
else
to
reply
curtis
sniffed
down
on
him
well
perhaps
i
am
perhaps
it
would
be
better
if
he
were
down
on
himself
when
i
see
him
try
hard
for
balls
that
he
can
t
get
or
make
some
good
long
throws
right
when
they
re
needed
or
slide
hard
to
bases
or
make
a
good
sacrifice
hit
then
i
ll
change
my
tompkins
has
improved
hasn
t
he
said
marks
suddenly
changing
to
a
fresh
subject
john
curtis
was
not
an
agreeable
person
to
argue
with
for
he
held
his
opinions
tenaciously
and
had
unpleasant
things
to
say
to
those
who
held
opposing
views
and
marks
who
argued
on
athletics
in
a
very
fluent
and
confident
style
when
he
had
laymen
like
himself
to
deal
with
felt
a
little
shy
before
a
real
athlete
even
though
the
sport
under
discussion
was
not
that
in
which
the
athlete
excelled
that
s
right
replied
curtis
no
great
genius
with
curves
i
judge
but
he
has
good
control
and
uses
his
head
the
difficulty
with
him
is
that
he
s
a
fool
marks
looked
curiously
into
the
football
player
s
face
apparently
every
one
s
a
fool
one
i
suppose
but
john
we
ll
except
present
company
the
sake
of
politeness
responded
curtis
with
a
malicious
smile
hovering
about
his
lips
marks
always
bored
him
tompkins
is
a
fool
but
not
of
the
silly
kind
like
taylor
he
s
got
the
stuff
in
him
to
make
a
good
pitcher
and
a
chance
to
distinguish
himself
by
winning
the
hillbury
game
but
he
doesn
t
care
a
rap
whether
he
pitches
or
not
and
he
doesn
t
behave
himself
as
he
i
don
t
understand
that
he
seems
very
regular
in
his
training
and
practice
he
always
works
hard
out
here
i
m
oh
i
don
t
mean
that
curtis
made
haste
to
reply
tommy
is
straight
he
ll
do
what
he
agrees
to
good
deal
better
than
your
friend
taylor
the
trouble
with
tommy
is
that
he
s
always
trying
fool
tricks
like
a
small
boy
in
a
grammar
school
some
day
he
ll
go
too
far
and
then
there
ll
be
an
end
of
tommy
sands
ought
to
sit
on
sands
tries
to
but
it
doesn
t
do
any
good
replied
marks
he
doesn
t
care
for
isn
t
there
some
one
he
does
care
for
asked
curtis
the
only
fellow
he
seems
to
think
anything
of
is
melvin
the
truly
good
answered
marks
with
a
sneer
no
one
else
has
any
influence
over
him
and
i
doubt
if
melvin
can
make
any
impression
on
him
tommy
is
altogether
too
that
night
curtis
and
sands
appeared
at
melvin
s
room
with
serious
faces
dick
heard
their
tale
in
silence
i
ll
tell
you
what
i
should
do
he
said
at
length
i
d
give
him
a
good
warning
and
then
i
d
fill
his
place
pitcher
or
no
pitcher
if
he
can
t
keep
out
of
scrapes
he
s
bound
to
go
sooner
or
later
and
if
he
s
surely
going
the
longer
you
wait
the
worse
it
will
be
no
fellow
who
won
t
take
responsibility
or
won
t
keep
training
belongs
on
a
seaton
team
sands
shook
his
head
dolefully
that
s
all
very
well
in
theory
but
you
can
t
make
pitchers
to
order
and
tommy
is
our
only
good
one
he
works
hard
too
uses
his
head
well
and
improves
right
along
if
he
could
only
be
kept
out
of
mischief
i
couldn
t
ask
for
a
better
and
we
thought
you
might
have
some
influence
with
him
said
curtis
coming
in
his
usual
fashion
directly
to
the
point
won
t
you
tackle
him
and
see
if
you
can
t
get
some
sense
into
his
head
i
ll
see
what
i
can
do
replied
melvin
but
i
don
t
think
it
pays
to
plead
with
people
it
gives
them
the
swelled
the
two
visitors
departed
and
melvin
buried
himself
in
his
books
soon
however
he
was
interrupted
again
this
time
by
a
very
faint
and
timid
knock
hello
littlefield
he
called
to
the
slender
boy
a
year
or
two
younger
than
phil
who
slipped
in
and
closed
the
door
carefully
behind
him
anything
wrong
they
were
at
it
again
last
night
said
the
boy
with
a
look
in
which
shame
and
fear
were
curiously
blended
they
couldn
t
get
in
because
i
had
fixed
the
window
so
it
couldn
t
be
opened
enough
to
let
any
one
in
but
they
banged
something
against
the
outside
that
frightened
me
pretty
badly
for
a
few
did
you
go
to
sleep
again
yes
after
a
while
i
heard
the
clock
strike
two
and
that
s
better
than
you
did
the
first
time
you
were
oh
yes
the
time
the
fellow
stuck
his
head
in
at
midnight
and
gave
that
unearthly
yell
i
had
a
terrible
shock
i
don
t
think
i
slept
a
wink
that
i
wish
we
knew
when
these
visitors
were
likely
to
appear
again
said
dick
thoughtfully
we
might
have
some
fun
i
think
they
are
coming
said
littlefield
what
makes
you
think
so
the
stick
i
fixed
to
lock
my
window
is
gone
it
held
the
sashes
just
the
right
distance
apart
that
s
not
much
of
a
reason
i
know
but
i
have
a
feeling
that
they
will
come
what
makes
you
think
it
is
they
asked
the
senior
i
don
t
i
say
they
but
it
may
be
only
i
m
inclined
to
think
it
s
one
whoever
it
is
he
comes
on
that
projecting
ledge
and
there
s
barely
room
on
it
for
one
don
t
you
want
to
swap
rooms
with
me
you
take
my
bed
and
i
ll
try
a
look
of
delight
flashed
suddenly
upon
the
boy
s
face
and
let
them
find
you
instead
of
me
they
won
t
like
that
what
shall
you
do
if
they
come
i
ll
wait
and
see
said
melvin
perhaps
you
won
t
mind
it
said
the
boy
with
the
worried
expression
coming
back
into
his
eyes
if
i
were
stronger
i
suppose
i
shouldn
t
but
it
isn
t
pleasant
to
wake
up
suddenly
and
hear
some
one
trying
to
open
your
window
or
feel
in
the
darkness
that
there
may
be
a
person
in
the
room
it
spoils
your
sleep
and
makes
you
so
nervous
you
can
t
do
any
good
work
and
yet
i
know
it
s
a
kind
of
a
joke
and
i
ought
not
to
let
it
worry
a
mighty
poor
joke
said
phil
who
had
come
in
during
the
conversation
a
good
ducking
in
salt
river
would
be
the
proper
price
for
such
fun
why
don
t
you
set
a
steel
trap
and
catch
him
like
any
other
rat
let
s
try
my
scheme
first
said
melvin
when
you
re
ready
littlefield
come
in
and
take
my
bed
i
shan
t
turn
in
for
an
hour

chapter
xviii
a
spilled
pitcher
littlefield
crept
into
melvin
s
bed
that
night
with
a
sense
of
security
that
he
had
not
felt
for
weeks
and
was
soon
in
a
deep
restful
sleep
melvin
undressed
in
his
own
room
and
then
slipped
across
the
hall
in
pajamas
to
the
little
prep
s
room
turned
on
the
electric
light
and
surveyed
the
field
his
first
act
was
to
clear
away
the
lighter
furniture
so
as
to
leave
an
open
space
about
the
window
at
which
the
disturbance
was
wont
to
occur
then
he
filled
two
pitchers
with
water
and
placed
them
in
convenient
positions
one
close
to
the
corner
of
the
bed
the
other
against
the
wall
opposite
when
this
was
done
he
adjusted
the
after
the
usual
arrangement
and
at
the
top
of
the
lower
sash
in
the
corner
nearest
the
bed
fastened
a
nail
to
this
he
attached
one
end
of
a
string
and
taking
the
other
end
with
him
as
he
jumped
into
bed
he
drew
it
tight
and
tied
it
to
his
finger
now
if
i
can
only
keep
my
hand
quiet
he
thought
as
he
lay
down
any
movement
of
the
window
ought
to
rouse
me
but
i
suppose
i
shall
begin
to
roll
as
soon
as
i
am
asleep
and
get
the
string
loose
or
wake
myself
a
dozen
times
for
nothing
i
ll
give
it
a
trial
healthy
and
unworried
dick
fell
asleep
almost
as
soon
as
his
head
touched
the
pillow
in
his
sleep
he
turned
slightly
in
bed
and
threw
one
arm
above
his
head
so
that
the
pressure
of
the
cord
on
his
finger
made
itself
felt
the
pressure
occasioned
a
dream
and
the
dream
at
length
brought
him
back
to
consciousness
he
seemed
to
be
struggling
vainly
to
free
himself
from
one
of
the
gymnasium
rings
to
which
he
was
hanging
by
a
single
finger
he
squirmed
and
twisted
and
strove
to
cast
it
off
but
despite
his
struggles
the
ring
still
clung
to
the
finger
and
the
finger
still
clutched
the
ring
he
awoke
with
a
frightened
start
relieved
to
discover
that
he
was
free
from
the
ugly
predicament
yet
still
under
the
spell
of
the
vague
terror
of
the
vision
with
quickened
breath
and
straining
ears
he
listened
to
make
sure
there
was
no
other
reason
for
his
waking
except
for
the
distant
labored
puffing
of
a
night
freight
as
it
worked
its
way
through
the
edge
of
the
town
the
silence
was
absolute
muttering
reproaches
to
himself
for
the
undefined
dread
that
crept
into
his
heart
as
he
felt
the
depressing
influence
of
the
darkness
and
quiet
and
the
solitary
waiting
for
an
unknown
assailant
he
turned
over
and
settled
himself
once
more
in
a
comfortable
position
for
sleeping
the
rumbling
of
the
ponderous
train
died
gradually
away
in
the
distance
leaving
a
stillness
unnatural
and
oppressive
i
don
t
wonder
that
the
little
chap
s
nerves
are
unstrung
thought
dick
i
can
feel
my
heart
throb
all
over
my
the
watcher
s
nervous
tension
gradually
slackened
and
he
was
just
falling
into
a
doze
when
the
scrape
of
a
rubber
sole
on
a
stone
surface
brought
him
instantly
to
attention
as
the
nodding
fisherman
starts
with
the
first
tug
at
his
line
the
sound
came
clear
in
the
dead
silence
repeated
at
close
intervals
as
the
mysterious
visitor
crept
along
the
ledge
setting
foot
after
foot
slowly
and
carefully
in
place
at
the
first
distinct
noise
melvin
had
lifted
himself
upright
in
bed
and
listened
intently
and
fearfully
with
his
heart
madly
thumping
then
as
the
steps
drew
nearer
and
he
realized
that
the
opportunity
which
he
had
longed
for
was
really
to
be
granted
that
the
perpetrator
of
the
crazy
night
pranks
would
soon
be
delivered
into
his
hand
the
uncanny
spell
of
the
night
was
instantly
broken
throwing
off
the
useless
noose
from
his
finger
he
slipped
out
of
bed
and
took
his
stand
close
to
the
wall
beside
the
window
it
was
a
moonless
night
of
flying
clouds
and
melvin
peeping
round
the
window
casing
could
barely
distinguish
the
vague
outline
of
the
man
outside
who
clinging
to
the
window
stops
was
now
trying
to
raise
the
lower
sash
i
ll
bet
i
know
you
you
lunatic
thought
melvin
drawing
back
as
the
sash
slowly
lifted
we
ll
see
who
has
the
fun
out
of
this
night
s
the
visitor
now
had
the
window
high
enough
to
admit
his
head
and
shoulders
melvin
could
hear
the
shirt
scrape
against
the
bottom
of
the
sash
as
the
intruder
worked
himself
cautiously
in
from
this
sound
as
well
as
the
noise
of
breathing
the
waiting
senior
knew
that
his
quarry
was
within
the
room
as
far
as
the
waist
was
this
the
time
to
strike
would
the
fellow
come
in
still
farther
or
merely
yell
and
withdraw
beyond
reach
in
a
flash
dick
considered
the
question
and
came
to
his
decision
the
intruder
paused
listening
for
a
sound
from
the
bed
then
dick
heard
the
drawing
of
a
long
deep
breath
and
knew
what
it
meant
a
groan
awesome
and
sepulchral
broke
the
nocturnal
stillness
then
suddenly
choked
and
ended
in
a
gasp
two
strong
arms
caught
the
prowler
s
waist
like
the
jaws
of
a
steel
trap
and
jerked
the
floundering
legs
through
the
window
into
the
room
both
went
down
together
to
the
floor
when
with
the
recollection
that
the
owner
of
the
room
could
not
really
be
a
very
powerful
adversary
the
intruder
recovered
his
presence
of
mind
and
fighting
spirit
sure
of
his
prey
dick
let
himself
be
rolled
toward
the
side
of
the
room
where
one
of
the
pitchers
stood
then
with
a
quick
wrestler
s
turn
he
twisted
himself
on
top
found
the
pitcher
and
emptied
it
on
his
enemy
s
head
while
the
prostrate
boy
gulped
and
sputtered
and
coughed
melvin
freed
himself
and
groped
his
way
to
the
electric
light
i
thought
so
he
said
coolly
as
the
light
flashed
upon
tompkins
s
dripping
head
and
the
pool
on
the
floor
come
my
wild
western
injun
who
makes
a
specialty
of
frightening
little
boys
take
that
towel
and
help
mop
up
this
they
worked
for
a
few
minutes
without
a
word
when
the
task
was
finished
melvin
tossed
tompkins
a
steamer
rug
from
littlefield
s
sofa
and
pointed
to
a
chair
wrap
yourself
up
and
sit
down
this
thing
has
got
to
be
straightened
out
before
we
part
what
have
you
to
say
for
yourself
tompkins
spoke
for
the
first
time
great
sport
isn
t
it
to
scare
a
timid
little
chap
into
brain
fever
i
always
thought
you
were
half
fool
but
i
never
knew
before
that
you
were
such
a
i
m
not
a
coward
retorted
tompkins
aroused
i
didn
t
mean
to
hurt
the
boy
i
was
just
having
a
little
why
didn
t
you
try
it
on
me
then
or
some
other
fellow
of
your
size
it
wouldn
t
have
been
any
and
for
the
sake
of
your
amusement
you
keep
littlefield
in
fear
of
his
life
for
weeks
if
that
isn
t
cowardly
what
is
it
it
s
selfish
i
admit
said
tompkins
soberly
and
mean
but
not
call
it
selfish
and
mean
then
continued
melvin
if
you
prefer
here
you
are
chosen
by
the
school
to
be
pitcher
on
the
nine
a
position
of
honor
and
responsibility
and
you
behave
like
a
monkey
doing
all
sorts
of
fool
tricks
any
one
of
which
the
faculty
would
think
ample
reason
for
firing
you
what
do
you
call
that
it
seems
to
me
like
a
breach
of
i
don
t
know
answered
the
culprit
it
s
just
as
if
some
one
were
to
give
you
a
thousand
dollars
to
keep
for
him
and
you
agreed
to
take
care
of
it
and
then
spent
it
for
your
to
this
tompkins
said
nothing
at
all
the
senior
paused
a
minute
for
a
reply
and
then
continued
and
the
worst
thing
about
you
is
that
you
have
no
sense
or
conscience
and
never
will
have
any
you
aren
t
bad
you
re
just
childish
and
selfish
but
you
have
apparently
set
your
heart
on
getting
expelled
and
your
best
friend
can
t
stop
you
it
s
really
foolish
in
me
to
stand
here
talking
to
you
at
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
you
can
t
reform
or
if
you
can
you
won
with
disgust
stamped
on
every
feature
melvin
turned
to
look
at
his
watch
when
he
raised
his
eyes
again
tompkins
was
on
his
feet
yes
i
m
a
fool
dick
melvin
i
don
t
deny
it
but
i
m
not
a
hopeless
case
i
can
t
become
a
school
balance
wheel
like
you
but
you
won
t
catch
me
in
another
scrape
this
do
you
mean
it
demanded
the
senior
with
a
sharp
glance
at
the
speaker
s
face
i
do
i
ll
make
it
right
with
littlefield
you
see
if
i
get
into
trouble
dick
held
out
his
hand
and
gave
the
other
a
cordial
clasp
but
all
he
said
was
clear
out
then
and
let
me
go
to
sleep
i
ll
believe
in
the
reform
when
i
see
next
morning
melvin
waked
to
find
littlefield
standing
at
his
bedside
come
get
up
said
the
boy
with
a
grin
it
s
only
ten
minutes
to
breakfast
what
did
you
do
with
the
water
pitchers
on
his
way
to
chapel
half
an
hour
later
melvin
suddenly
felt
varrell
s
grip
on
his
arm
well
dick
it
has
happened
what
the
thing
that
i
said
would
happen
the
stealing
has
begun
again
some
one
has
taken
ten
dollars
from
durand
s
bureau
but
durand
s
room
is
in
the
other
that
makes
no
difference
you
can
reach
all
the
entries
through
the
chapter
xix
the
coveted
opportunity
i
ll
match
you
for
soda
bosworth
said
marks
all
right
replied
bosworth
cheerfully
as
he
flipped
the
coin
with
a
skill
born
of
experience
heads
it
is
i
ll
pay
come
on
two
sodas
the
clerk
filled
the
glasses
to
the
accompaniment
of
remarks
on
the
ball
games
sam
knew
his
business
agreeable
conversation
was
served
gratis
at
the
counter
with
all
soda
orders
for
fellows
like
marks
this
made
no
great
demand
on
the
server
s
originality
taylor
didn
t
get
his
home
run
on
saturday
remarked
the
clerk
gazing
out
of
the
window
at
the
no
he
didn
t
replied
marks
i
don
t
know
what
s
got
into
walt
he
hasn
t
made
a
long
drive
in
two
getting
stale
perhaps
said
the
clerk
who
had
only
a
dim
idea
as
to
what
stale
meant
but
fancied
the
word
a
little
too
sure
said
marks
he
ll
take
a
brace
before
the
hillbury
tompkins
is
making
quite
a
the
clerk
offered
the
suggestion
indifferently
there
were
two
opinions
as
to
tompkins
among
his
patrons
i
don
t
know
about
that
answered
marks
with
a
knowing
tilt
of
his
head
tompkins
isn
t
anything
great
when
he
s
at
his
best
and
when
he
s
poor
he
s
no
good
at
all
he
s
got
a
good
drop
and
an
underhand
rise
and
the
usual
out
and
in
but
that
s
about
it
s
sands
who
really
does
the
pitching
added
bosworth
draining
his
glass
sands
tells
him
exactly
where
to
put
the
ball
and
all
the
pitcher
has
to
do
is
to
follow
his
directions
there
s
no
great
credit
in
the
clerk
was
about
to
remark
that
to
put
the
ball
where
it
was
wanted
required
some
ability
but
on
second
thought
concluded
that
he
had
given
his
customers
their
money
s
worth
and
remained
silent
bosworth
was
going
through
his
pockets
i
thought
i
had
a
quarter
he
murmured
a
little
confused
marks
displayed
no
interest
in
the
search
he
had
change
in
his
purse
but
it
was
late
in
the

it
was
too
small
a
sum
to
ask
back
again
i
shall
have
to
break
a
bill

said
bosworth
drawing
out
a
note
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
you

said
marks
opening
his
eyes
i

only

ten

next
the
clerk
changed
the
bill
with
his
usual
nonchalant
air
and
turned
his
attention
to
more
interesting
customers
the
two
boys
sauntered
out
in
front
of
the
store
they
met
poole
bosworth
gave
him
a
stare
and
marks
a
cool
nod
which
phil
returned

coolly
he

bosworth

tone

little

sands
replied
marks
favoritism
doesn

go
down
with
him
there
s
been
a
lot
of
talk
about
it
though
i
ve
heard
fellows
say
that
the
kid
was
the
best
thrower
in
the
and
pretend
that
lyford
thought
so
too
i
heard
lyford
say
one
day
that
poole
was
the
only
man
playing
who
knew
how
to
bunt
but
that
s
nothing
i
don
t
believe
they
ll
be
likely
to
put
out
big
husky
fellows
like
vincent
and
sudbury
and
taylor
who
are
good
for
long
hits
for
a
little
bantam
that
can
only
bosworth

baseball
than
in
cultivating
the
acquaintance
of

he
thought
popular

out

i
must
be
getting

he
said
i

still
doing
that

i

got
a
whole
stableful
interlinears
teachers
editions
hinds
and
noble
you
want
it
s
the
best
collection
in
on
wednesday
the
nine
played
the
harvard
second
phil
sat
on
the
bench
as
usual
waiting
for
the
chance
that
never
came
amusing
himself
by
guessing
from
the
attitude
of
the
players
at
the
bat
where
their
hits
would
be
and
planning
the
position
he
should
take
in
if
he
were
playing
for
the
various
men
ordinarily
when
a
visiting
nine
had
already
played
hillbury
he
contrived
to
strike
up
a
conversation
with
the
pitcher
or
some
of
the
fielders
and
learn
if
possible
where
and
how
the
various
hillbury
batters
had
hit
the
players
from
the
university
had
seemed
so
of
them
was
a
famous
varsity
the
boy
had
not
yet
mustered
courage
to
accost
them
by
this
process
of
questioning
visiting
teams
phil
had
gathered
a
very
considerable
fund
of
information
about
the
peculiarities
of
the
individuals
who
made
up
the
hillbury
team
the
pitchers
contributed
most
to
this
fund
for
they
were
often
able
to
recall
clearly
just
what
kind
of
balls
had
deceived
the
respective
hillbury
batsmen
and
what
had
proved
unsuccessful
one
was
easily
caught
by
a
sharp
drop
another
could
not
hit
a
fast
straight
ball
kept
high
still
another
was
regularly
fooled
by
a
change
of
pace
all
these
discoveries
with
other
facts
culled
from
newspaper
accounts
went
down
in
the
baseball
which
phil
had
started
early
in
the
winter
but
no
one
except
dick
had
yet
seen
he
meant
in
time
to
submit
the
results
to
sands
and
tompkins
at
present
he
was
still
collecting
facts
the
game
was
already
past
the
fourth
inning
without
a
run
scored
on
either
side
the
visitors
had
twice
got
a
man
as
far
as
second
base
once
on
a
fumble
by
hayes
the
and
a
hit
to
once
on
a
long
drive
to
close
to
the
line
which
taylor
ran
for
but
did
not
reach
tompkins
was
getting
acquainted
with
the
batters
he
had
his
own
way
of
testing
a
new
man
first
he
tried
to
drive
him
away
from
the
plate
by
a
ball
close
in
if
the
batsman
pulled
away
he
was
sure
he
was
pitching
to
a
timid
man
and
caught
him
on
an
assortment
of
swift
curves
if
on
the
other
hand
the
batsman
declined
to
pull
away
tompkins
knew
that
he
had
to
do
with
a
cool
determined
hitter
who
would
probably
be
able
to
detect
the
curve
on
the
break
and
meet
it
squarely
to
such
dangerous
men
he
gave
his
best
drops
and
worked
high
and
low
straight
balls
with
a
change
of
pace
so
far
his
method
had
been
successful
with
the
visitors
taylor
came
in
at
the
beginning
of
the
fifth
with
a
pale
face
i
m
afraid
i
can
t
finish
out
archie
he
said
to
sands
i
feel
so
blamed
sick
i
can
hardly
what
s
the
matter
demanded
sands
with
little
show
of
sympathy
my
stomach
s
out
of
order
i
think
groaned
taylor
i
haven
t
been
well
all
what
have
you
been
putting
into
it
nothing
is
nothing
sands
peered
at
him
for
an
instant
questioningly
well
then
go
home
and
lie
down
here
poole
take
taylor
s
place
you
re
up
the
blood
rushed
to
phil
s
face
his
pulse
began
to
leap
in
excited
throbs
he
was
to
have
a
chance
in
a
real
game
hard
game
too
he
bent
over
the
pile
of
bats
to
choose
his
favorite
glad
of
an
opportunity
to
hide
his
confusion
and
a
little
afraid
of
hearing
unfriendly
criticism
now
s
your
chance
to
show
what
s
in
you
phil
said
watson
the
third
baseman
who
liked
the
boy
you
can
hit
him
all
stand
up
to
the
plate
warned
sands
and
don
t
let
him
frighten
you
manning
isn
t
as
bad
as
he
sudbury
had
two
strikes
called
on
him
then
hit
a
liner
over
second
now
phil
said
tompkins
quietly
you
know
what
we
expect
of
poole
planted
his
left
foot
firmly
beside
the
plate
raised
his
bat
and
waited
wondering
whether
manning
would
try
on
him
the
method
tompkins
used
for
new
men
the
pitcher
wound
himself
up
with
the
usual
absurd
motion
and
sent
a
ball
whistling
hot
that
veered
suddenly
off
the
plate
phil
smiled
to
himself
and
gripped
the
bat
more
firmly
no
i
ll
not
bite
at
any
such
he
said
to
himself
old
rowley
has
given
me
too
many
of
next
came
a
drop
but
it
was
low
two
balls
then
one
close
in
which
the
batter
hesitated
on
and
then
let
pass
this
was
also
called
a
ball
the
next
was
straight
and
fast
i
know
you
thought
phil
and
swung
straight
at
it
meeting
the
ball
fairly
on
the
as
he
sped
exultantly
away
to
first
he
saw
the
ball
cutting
a
line
well
above
the
first
baseman
s
head
knowing
that
the
hit
was
good
for
two
bases
at
least
he
rounded
first
with
all
his
attention
centred
on
his
running
passed
second
and
then
looking
for
the
ball
for
the
first
time
and
seeing
the
just
about
to
throw
he
went
on
easily
to
third
where
watson
caught
him
by
the
shoulders
and
made
him
pause
sudbury
was
already
back
upon
the
bench
splendid
exclaimed
watson
i
always
said
you
could
do
it
bring
your
fielding
to
that
level
and
you
ll
get
your
sands
went
out
on
strikes
waddington
hit
a
long
fly
to
centre
which
the
harvard
fielder
got
under
without
much
exertion
and
secured
he
threw
it
in
with
all
the
speed
he
could
but
phil
who
was
waiting
on
the
bag
for
the
ball
to
touch
the
fielder
s
hands
was
off
with
the
harvard
man
s
first
motion
and
easily
beat
the
ball
to
the
plate
why
didn
t
he
throw
to
second
and
let
second
throw
it
home
inquired
tompkins
of
the
coach
wouldn
t
that
have
been
quicker
i
think
so
at
that
distance
said
lyford
the
great
makes
a
single
long
throw
but
with
players
of
average
ability
two
quick
line
throws
will
bring
the
ball
in
sooner
and
more
hayes
hit
to
second
base
and
made
the
third
man
out
the
seatonians
trotted
contentedly
away
to
their
positions
they
were
sure
of
two
runs
anyway
out
at
left
phil
was
abandoned
to
his
own
devices
either
because
he
wanted
to
try
the
player
or
because
he
had
no
distinct
notion
as
to
where
the
batter
was
likely
to
hit
sands
gave
no
hint
as
to
the
best
position
for
the
fielder
to
take
as
hawkins
the
second
baseman
who
led
the
batting
list
stood
boldly
up
to
the
plate
as
if
he
were
longing
to
pound
the
first
ball
pitched
phil
took
a
position
well
out
drawing
he
knew
not
why
somewhat
toward
the
hawkins
did
pound
the
first
ball
pitched
but
he
struck
a
trifle
too
soon
and
a
little
underneath
the
result
was
a
beautiful
high
foul
over
by
the
benches
on
the
edge
of
the
field
instinctively
as
the
ball
rose
the
started
it
fell
easily
into
his
hands
ten
yards
outside
the
foul
line
the
second
batter
went
out
on
a
grounder
to
watson
the
next
man
up
sent
a
fly
between
centre
and
left
which
poole
who
was
nearer
also
took
in
five
minutes
seaton
was
at
bat
again
in
the
sixth
and
seventh
neither
side
scored
though
the
collegians
repeatedly
got
men
on
bases
and
phil
captured
another
fly
this
time
in
short
in
the
eighth
the
visitors
through
an
error
by
robinson
and
hard
hitting
succeeded
in
tying
the
score
the
schoolboys
came
in
for
the
last
inning
a
little
depressed
hillbury
had
beaten
the
harvard
second
six
to
four
if
their
rivals
had
made
six
runs
in
the
face
of
a
good
pitcher
like
manning
while
seaton
could
make
but
two
the
inference
was
obvious
with
three
balls
called
robinson
went
out
on
strikes
watson
got
his
base
on
balls
sudbury
made
his
second
hit
clean
drive
to
centre
advancing
watson
to
third
phil
took
his
bat
and
started
for
the
plate
bunt
the
first
one
and
let
watson
come
home
said
lyford
as
phil
passed
him
i
can
bunt
a
low
ball
said
phil
but
what
shall
i
do
if
it
comes
high
hit
it
out
said
lyford
there
were
calls
for
the
batter
and
phil
hurried
to
his
position
took
a
firm
stand
and
waited
the
first
one
was
low
and
a
little
wide
but
phil
reached
over
to
meet
it
and
dropped
it
along
the
halfway
between
home
and
third
the
same
instant
he
was
off
running
with
all
his
might
for
first
watson
had
started
at
half
speed
with
the
pitch
and
on
the
bunt
came
on
with
all
his
strength
reaching
home
just
as
the
pitcher
picked
up
the
ball
meantime
phil
with
his
s
start
was
safe
at
first
when
the
pitcher
threw
to
cut
him
off
and
sudbury
went
on
to
third
the
schoolboys
on
the
benches
cheered
loudly
at
the
successful
play
breaking
suddenly
off
to
watch
the
next
move
sands
hit
at
the
first
ball
pitched
and
sent
a
grounder
to
the
third
baseman
who
fumbled
just
long
enough
to
prevent
his
throw
to
first
then
came
two
strikes
on
waddington
in
quick
succession
sands
gave
the
signal
for
a
double
steal
and
on
the
next
pitch
started
hard
for
second
and
phil
a
trifle
later
for
third
the
harvard
catcher
hesitated
then
threw
to
third
but
in
his
haste
he
threw
a
little
wide
and
the
boy
slid
safely
waddington
went
out
on
strikes
and
hayes
took
his
place
two
men
out
run
on
anything
shouted
watson
at
the
the
harvard
catcher
pretended
a
passed
ball
and
ran
back
a
few
feet
but
watson
saw
the
trick
and
kept
phil
on
the
base
hayes
had
two
strikes
and
three
balls
called
on
him
the
crowd
waited
eagerly
for
the
next
pitch
four
balls
hayes
sped
away
to
first
manning
snarled
and
stamped
the
crowd
yelled
tompkins
came
up
bat
in
hand
with
a
determined
look
on
his
face
one
ball
the
catcher
threw
to
third
but
phil
who
was
watching
the
ball
as
a
cat
watches
the
low
flight
of
a
bird
flung
himself
back
in
safety
the
harvard
third
pretending
to
throw
to
first
let
drive
at
second
sands
scrambled
back
as
best
he
could
but
the
ball
reached
the
base
before
he
did
and
only
the
error
of
the
second
baseman
who
seemed
as
much
surprised
as
sands
saved
the
latter
from
an
out
tompkins
who
knew
he
was
no
batter
was
waiting
two
balls
one
strike
the
next
one
tempted
him
and
he
hit
at
it
but
it
was
a
wide
out
curve
two
strikes
then
came
an
in
curve
sweeping
in
over
the
corner
of
the
plate
tommy
did
not
want
to
try
it
at
all
but
he
knew
that
if
he
did
not
he
should
go
out
on
called
strikes
so
he
smote
at
it
with
all
his
strength
and
was
as
much
surprised
as
manning
though
by
no
means
so
unpleasantly
to
see
the
ball
go
flying
over
the
third
baseman
s
head
phil
came
trotting
in
followed
closely
by
sands
while
hayes
paused
at
third
and
then
tompkins
having
glorified
himself
and
brought
in
two
runners
by
a
hit
ventured
too
far
off
second
and
was
ignominiously
put
out
on
a
quick
throw
from
the
pitcher
in
their
half
of
the
inning
the
harvard
men
tried
hard
to
retrieve
themselves
the
first
man
up
went
out
on
strikes
big
gerold
then
proceeded
to
pound
the
ball
to
the
fence
phil
got
it
back
in
season
to
hold
the
man
on
third
but
the
next
man
brought
in
the
run
with
a
single
then
followed
two
easy
flies
and
the
game
was
over
with
the
score
five
to
three
in
favor
of
seaton
the
students
went
home
elated
tompkins
had
held
the
heavy
batters
down
to
a
few
hits
the
nine
had
fielded
well
and
had
hit
the
ball
when
hits
were
the
forecast
for
the
hillbury
game
seemed
at
least
fair
well
what
do
you
think
now
said
the
coach
to
sands
as
they
walked
slowly
over
to
the
dressing
rooms
about
the
game
why
it
was
a
good
one
the
best
yet
i
no
about
poole
isn
t
he
a
better
man
than
taylor
i
wish
i
knew
replied
sands
he
certainly
batted
well
i
doubt
if
we
should
have
done
as
well
with
taylor
he
caught
three
flies
too
but
two
of
those
came
into
his
the
coach
smiled
did
you
give
him
any
directions
as
to
where
he
should
stand
why
no
i
let
him
take
his
own
then
do
you
know
that
those
three
flies
coming
in
two
innings
were
in
totally
different
parts
of
the
field
what
of
it
asked
sands
perplexed
why
the
boy
has
a
good
fielder
s
instinct
he
guesses
well
where
the
batter
is
likely
to
that
may
be
luck
replied
the
captain
thoughtfully
in
my
opinion
at
least
there
is
no
question
as
to
the
men
said
the
coach
rather
curtly
poole
is
better
at
the
bat
better
as
a
fielder
and
better
in
another
what
s
that
he
takes
good
care
of
and
with
this
last
opinion
sands
had
to
agree
on
thursday
and
friday
the
team
practiced
as
usual
poole
batting
with
the
squad
and
catching
flies
with
the
taylor
was
back
in
his
place
on
saturday
morning
sands
hailed
phil
as
they
were
coming
out
of
chapel
be
out
early
this
phil
nodded
and
went
on
into
the
mathematics
room
another
afternoon
on
the
bench
he
thought
dismally
taylor
s
stomach
isn
t
likely
to
fail
him
as
he
entered
his
room
an
hour
later
he
found
melvin
deep
in
the
seatonian
which
had
just
been
delivered
see
here
phil
called
his
with
a
joyful
light
dancing
in
his
eyes
here
s
information
for
you
and
phil
looking
over
melvin
s
shoulder
at
the
passage
in
the
notes
and
brevities

an
unexpected
blow
well
dick
another
case
of
thieving
losing
you
can
t
tell
anything
about
a
careless
fellow
like
what
is
it
this
time
asked
dick
money
yes
replied
varrell
a
purse
out
of
his
clothes
in
the
gymnasium
locker
he
dressed
early
for
ball
practice
and
tucked
his
key
under
the
locker
door
when
he
came
back
the
money
was
it
s
strange
we
can
t
stop
this
thing
exclaimed
melvin
there
were
a
dozen
fellows
in
the
locker
rooms
during
the
afternoon
bosworth
was
one
of
course
and
he
was
there
early
but
no
one
suspects
him
hayes
thinks
it
was
one
of
the
boys
and
farnum
who
told
me
about
it
charges
it
to
the
painter
i
know
who
did
it
i
ll
bet
but
i
have
no
more
proof
than
in
the
case
of
the
given
that
up
at
last
haven
t
you
said
melvin
with
a
broad
smile
of
amusement
on
his
face
you
re
great
on
theories
and
suspicions
and
can
read
a
man
s
lips
fifty
feet
away
but
all
the
same
when
it
comes
to
facts
you
re
not
that
may
be
so
and
may
not
be
said
varrell
with
an
air
of
superiority
i
don
t
pretend
to
be
a
detective
but
i
haven
t
given
up
hope
and
shall
not
give
it
up
till
i
board
the
train
after
the
college
exams
in
june
the
fellow
is
getting
reckless
and
will
sooner
or
later
expose
himself
all
we
can
do
is
to
watch
and
watch
and
wait
sniffed
melvin
that
s
what
we
ve
been
doing
isn
t
it
and
see
what
has
the
result
been
durand
has
lost
money
and
hayes
has
lost
money
and
we
re
no
nearer
getting
our
hands
on
the
thief
than
we
were
oh
yes
we
are
said
varrell
to
begin
with
eddy
has
become
intimate
again
with
bosworth
i
have
seen
him
two
or
three
times
lately
in
bosworth
s
room
yesterday
they
had
a
hot
discussion
about
something
and
some
of
it
was
carried
on
near
the
window
while
i
was
at
work
behind
my
blinds
with
the
help
of
my
zeiss
i
caught
several
expressions
that
gave
me
a
clew
to
the
what
did
they
say
asked
dick
eagerly
well
bosworth
was
the
first
one
who
appeared
he
came
to
the
window
wearing
that
sneering
look
of
his
and
looked
down
to
see
if
there
was
any
one
outside
before
he
turned
around
he
looked
across
to
my
window
and
as
he
did
so
he
said
you
can
t
help
yourself
you
re
in
it
as
deep
as
i
am
you
gave
me
the
information
and
shared
the
profits
if
i
get
into
trouble
i
take
you
with
then
both
remained
away
for
some
minutes
eddy
was
the
next
to
show
himself
with
tears
running
down
his
cheeks
and
his
chin
jerking
with
sobs
so
that
it
was
hard
to
follow
the
motion
of
his
lips
apparently
he
said
nothing
for
a
minute
but
just
leaned
his
forehead
against
the
frame
of
the
lower
sash
which
was
raised
high
suddenly
he
clenched
his
fist
and
brought
it
down
on
the
window
seat
and
cried
out
i
won
t
keep
the
dirty
money
i
ll
pay
you
back
the
first
of
next
month
and
then
you
will
see
you
he
turned
his
head
away
so
that
i
couldn
t
see
the
next
words
bosworth
appeared
immediately
and
pulled
him
away
from
the
poor
little
fool
said
melvin
sadly
what
a
pity
we
can
t
do
something
to
save
him
from
that
rascal
bosworth
has
apparently
got
some
grip
on
him
and
is
scaring
the
life
out
of
he
s
probably
lent
eddy
money
and
by
pretending
it
s
a
part
of
what
was
in
the
safe
has
tied
the
boy
s
tongue
it
is
clear
that
eddy
holds
the
key
to
the
situation
if
some
one
could
only
induce
him
to
tell
what
he
knows
it
would
give
us
the
evidence
we
need
to
banish
bosworth
and
might
help
us
to
save
eddy
does
phil
know
him
well
i
don
t
think
they
are
intimate
replied
dick
but
they
know
each
other
fairly
why
can
t
phil
draw
the
little
chap
out
said
varrell
it
s
for
the
boy
s
own
phil
yielded
with
bad
grace
to
the
older
boys
request
to
a
character
transparently
frank
and
wholly
detesting
underhand
methods
the
task
savored
of
dishonesty
only
when
he
was
assured
that
eddy
was
in
the
power
of
a
dangerous
person
whose
grip
on
the
boy
it
was
important
to
break
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
did
he
consent
to
make
the
attempt
the
next
morning
he
offered
to
join
eddy
in
his
room
for
the
working
out
of
the
algebra
problems
eddy
accepted
the
offer
with
alacrity
both
because
he
welcomed
assistance
and
because
he
was
pleased
to
have
a
boy
like
poole
in
his
room
when
the
lesson
was
at
an
end
phil
asked
him
flatly
what
he
found
attractive
in
bosworth
eddy
became
red
and
white
by
turns
and
said
he
didn
t
know
then
phil
pressed
his
question
and
eddy
didn
t
know
and
couldn
t
tell
until
a
great
storm
of
tears
and
sobs
melted
the
heart
of
the
unwilling
inquisitor
and
brought
the
examination
to
an
abrupt
close
phil
had
just
resolution
enough
left
before
he
fled
the
painful
scene
to
urge
the
unfortunate
boy
to
let
bosworth
wholly
alone
and
if
he
had
anything
bad
on
his
conscience
to
confide
it
to
grim
or
some
one
else
who
could
help
him
that
settles
it
for
the
present
said
varrell
when
he
heard
the
report
the
scoundrel
has
the
little
fool
tied
hand
and
foot
we
must
play
the
waiting
game
a
while
if
grim
knew
what
we
know
he
would
worm
the
facts
out
of
eddy
in
ten
minutes
said
phil
i
m
not
so
sure
of
it
replied
varrell
that
s
the
last
card
anyway
i
m
not
willing
to
play
that
the
season
was
drawing
toward
its
interesting
end
on
the
following
saturday
was
to
be
held
the
school
track
meet
a
week
later
the
contest
with
hillbury
and
after
another
week
the
great
baseball
game
with
the
same
rivals
before
and
after
the
athletic
contests
and
sprinkled
in
among
them
came
the
morgan
prize
speaking
the
morgan
composition
reading
the
contests
for
the
english
and
mathematical
prizes
class
dinners
society
elections
preparation
for
and
pleasures
of
every
variety
to
goad
the
conscientious
and
inspire
the
indifferent
varrell
restricted
his
ambition
to
his
studies
and
pole
vaulting
and
so
had
strength
in
reserve
for
the
still
hunt
after
beelzebub
name
which
after
three
months
of
milton
gradually
and
naturally
replaced
bosworth
in
the
private
conversations
of
the
two
friends
melvin
s
occupations
were
more
varied
besides
his
regular
school
work
which
he
was
anxious
to
do
well
to
the
very
end
there
were
the
troublesome
duties
of
track
manager
to
be
performed
the
regular
jumping
practice
to
be
kept
up
and
a
part
to
prepare
the
still
hunt
he
left
to
varrell
who
undertook
to
do
the
watching
while
dick
attended
to
the
waiting
the
cares
of
management
proved
considerably
greater
than
melvin
had
anticipated
in
addition
to
the
worry
of
collecting
subscriptions
and
the
necessity
of
bothering
with
the
large
number
of
men
and
numerous
details
involved
in
a
dozen
events
he
found
himself
bearing
burdens
that
really
belonged
to
another
dickinson
the
captain
possessed
a
very
peculiar
character
he
could
run
like
a
deer
in
the
and
the
quarter
ordinary
handicaps
seemed
of
no
use
against
him
this
year
he
had
been
experimenting
with
the
hundred
yards
as
well
and
in
two
trials
out
of
three
he
could
give
tommy
travers
who
had
been
for
two
years
the
best
man
in
school
three
or
four
yards
and
beat
him
with
ease
yet
with
this
marvelous
natural
ability
which
had
lifted
him
suddenly
the
year
before
from
a
position
of
unimportance
to
one
of
great
popularity
he
had
only
a
slight
interest
in
his
sport
he
ran
because
the
school
wanted
him
to
run
not
because
he
either
loved
the
sport
or
hankered
after
the
glory
of
winning
left
to
himself
he
would
sooner
or
later
have
abandoned
the
track
altogether
and
settled
back
into
solitary
moping
with
his
books
as
it
was
he
often
appeared
moody
and
apathetic
and
neglected
many
of
the
duties
which
a
captain
likes
especially
to
perform
inspiration
and
push
had
to
come
from
the
manager
the
jumping
took
a
course
discouragingly
uncertain
almost
every
day
dick
began
his
practice
with
the
feeling
that
he
had
reached
his
limit
sometimes
as
he
dropped
an
inch
or
two
below
previous
records
he
was
convinced
of
it
then
on
the
next
day
perhaps
or
the
day
after
when
he
had
concluded
that
there
was
no
great
jump
in
him
and
that
he
must
be
satisfied
with
a
moderate
achievement
he
would
surprise
himself
by
going
a
half
inch
higher
than
he
had
ever
attained
before
and
there
were
times
when
he
had
enjoyed
a
particularly
long
and
restful
sleep
or
his
physical
condition
was
exactly
right
at
which
he
really
felt
like
jumping
then
his
ambition
went
wild
and
he
told
himself
exultantly
that
the
limit
was
still
far
away
such
days
came
rarely
should
he
have
one
on
the
or
more
important
still
on
the
thirtieth
on
tuesday
evening
dick
and
varrell
and
phil
went
together
to
the
chapel
to
hear
the
prize
speaking
curtis
joined
them
at
the
door
and
all
four
took
seats
near
the
front
it
was
a
long
performance
but
the
boys
listened
with
interest
and
amused
themselves
by
guessing
on
the
merits
of
the
contestants
as
speech
followed
speech
in
close
succession
curtis
voted
for
planter
melvin
for
durand
varrell
for
todd
and
phil
for
a
boy
who
delivered
an
extract
from
a
speech
by
henry
clay
when
the
judges
returned
the
award
of
first
prize
to
planter
second
to
von
gersdorf
and
honorable
mention
for
todd
and
durand
each
flattered
himself
on
his
critical
judgment
varrell
said
good
night
at
the
steps
of
carter
and
went
on
to
his
own
dormitory
curtis
who
was
in
a
talkative
mood
proposed
to
go
up
for
a
when
he
had
settled
himself
in
an
phil
who
distrusted
such
minutes
gathered
up
his
greek
books
and
retreated
to
a
classmate
s
room
across
the
hall
do
you
know
dick
planter
is
the
kind
of
fellow
i
admire
he
ranks
well
as
well
as
you
do
he
s
an
editor
of
the
seatonian
and
on
the
and
is
always
to
the
fore
on
an
occasion
like
this
fletcher
is
a
better
scholar
i
suppose
but
he
s
nothing
else
planter
can
write
and
speak
as
well
as
get
marks
he
has
good
manners
too
and
is
always
a
i
didn
t
know
you
admired
gentle
qualities
said
dick
amused
and
as
for
marks
why
it
s
only
this
year
that
you
ve
been
on
friendly
terms
with
any
kind
of
better
late
than
never
i
ve
had
a
lot
of
new
ideas
this
are
you
going
back
on
athletics
asked
dick
they
are
all
right
in
their
place
i
wouldn
t
exchange
my
football
experiences
for
anything
this
crank
factory
ever
gave
to
daniel
webster
or
any
other
great
genius
who
got
his
first
call
down
on
our
benches
but
i
don
t
want
to
be
always
john
curtis
the
football
player
i
want
something
better
than
john
curtis
the
harvard
freshman
suggested
dick
curtis
smiled
grimly
that
s
what
i
m
going
to
be
if
it
s
possible
for
the
possessor
of
my
brains
i
m
making
headway
too
if
i
d
only
begun
last
year
i
might
have
been
somewhere
you
can
do
it
yet
said
dick
encouragingly
i
ll
make
a
bluff
at
it
anyway
replied
the
football
captain
but
it
s
like
trying
to
rush
the
ball
seventy
yards
in
the
last
ten
minutes
of
the
phil
came
in
looked
significantly
at
the
clock
and
took
off
his
coat
yes
i
know
it
s
time
for
me
to
go
said
curtis
struggling
to
his
feet
we
re
all
in
training
and
ought
to
be
in
bed
by
this
time
that
was
a
good
game
you
put
up
last
phil
looked
at
him
suspiciously
oh
i
mean
it
added
curtis
and
you
ll
have
the
crowd
with
you
too
if
you
can
keep
it
up
don
t
mind
what
you
hear
from
marks
and
that
on
thursday
dick
came
home
promptly
after
supper
for
a
long
evening
s
pull
at
his
part
phil
was
already
there
did
you
see
that
letter
from
cambridge
dick
he
asked
i
put
it
on
the
melvin
took
it
up
carelessly
from
martin
he
said
glancing
at
the
address
i
wonder
what
he
he
opened
it
while
phil
stood
quietly
by
waiting
for
news
of
their
old
school
friend
as
melvin
read
a
tense
serious
look
came
over
his
face
and
he
lifted
his
head
instinctively
as
if
to
meet
an
adversary
after
he
had
finished
he
still
held
the
letter
in
his
hand
and
sat
staring
stupidly
at
the
window
what
is
it
cried
phil
has
anything
happened
to
martin
no
but
something
has
happened
to
us
read
it
and
and
phil
read
this
dear
old
dick
just
a
word
to
tell
you
of
some
kind
of
a
scheme
on
foot
to
protest
dickinson
i
got
it
from
a
junior
who
rooms
in
my
entry
who
got
it
from
an
old
hillbury
man
they
say
that
dickinson
ran
in
a
race
in
indiana
last
fourth
of
july
for
a
money
prize
and
they
have
posters
to
show
that
he
was
advertised
to
take
part
in
the
race
is
it
so
if
it
is
he
has
buried
himself
for
school
and
college
athletics
as
deep
as
china
if
it
isn
t
you
ll
have
to
disprove
the
charge
fair
and
square
beyond
the
point
where
a
doubt
can
be
imagined
or
they
ll
shut
him
out
bestir
yourself
yours
and
seaton
s
forever
l
what
are
you
going
to
do
asked
phil
as
dick
put
on
his
hat
i
m
going
to
have
it
out
with
dickinson
first
replied
the
senior
bitterly
then
we
ll
see
what
s
to
be
chapter
xxi
a
gloomy
prospect
dickinson
was
in
his
room
he
had
just
returned
also
planning
for
a
long
pull
at
his
books
the
usual
evening
routine
for
him
melvin
banged
at
the
door
then
jerked
it
open
with
little
ceremony
dickinson
looked
up
in
mild
wonder
hello
i
thought
you
had
consecrated
your
evening
to
the
muses
what
s
up
you
look
as
if
you
were
on
the
i
am
answered
the
visitor
fiercely
his
face
was
set
in
harsh
lines
while
his
voice
which
he
vainly
strove
to
control
came
forth
choked
and
strained
and
trembling
do
you
know
what
makes
a
professional
why
i
suppose
i
do
replied
the
wondering
dickinson
who
was
giving
less
attention
to
the
question
than
to
his
friend
s
unaccountable
agitation
well
what
is
it
why
to
play
for
money
or
your
board
or
any
such
anything
else
yes
to
compete
with
professionals
or
for
money
prizes
or
what
demanded
the
questioner
or
take
part
in
some
kind
of
an
open
contest
which
the
governing
boards
for
some
technical
reason
or
other
forbid
i
never
understood
about
it
very
well
fact
never
concerned
myself
with
it
it
doesn
t
affect
us
and
it
seemed
to
me
quite
enough
to
know
the
general
rules
the
genuine
amateur
doesn
t
need
rules
anyway
his
own
instinct
for
what
s
right
and
fair
would
keep
him
oh
it
would
replied
the
manager
with
virulent
sarcasm
yes
it
would
retorted
dickinson
catching
fire
himself
at
the
persistent
what
s
got
into
you
anyway
why
do
you
come
here
in
this
choking
crazy
fashion
and
ask
me
wild
questions
what
do
you
mean
dickinson
was
standing
now
facing
his
visitor
with
a
challenging
look
which
warned
melvin
that
he
was
beginning
wrong
he
hesitated
a
moment
trying
to
control
his
voice
and
groping
for
a
simple
way
back
to
the
proper
path
well
what
is
it
demanded
dickinson
in
peremptory
tones
don
t
stand
there
rolling
your
eyes
out
with
it
it
s
about
you
jim
said
melvin
at
last
abandoning
any
attempt
at
a
wise
leading
of
the
conversation
and
speaking
as
his
anger
cooled
somewhat
with
less
animosity
and
more
sorrow
in
his
voice
did
you
really
run
in
indiana
last
summer
with
professionals
for
a
money
prize
for
a
short
minute
dickinson
blinked
at
the
questioner
in
stupefaction
then
with
a
quick
transformation
as
memory
presented
a
picture
of
a
past
occurrence
the
blood
came
rushing
to
his
cheeks
and
a
fierce
light
blazed
in
his
eyes
well
what
about
it
demanded
dick
again
the
examiner
but
losing
his
bitterness
before
the
glare
of
indignation
which
dickinson
threw
upon
him
can
t
you
speak
there
s
no
use
in
speaking
answered
the
runner
sullenly
if
you
think
i
m
that
kind
of
a
man
it
makes
no
difference
what
i
say
my
word
wouldn
t
be
good
for
anything
a
man
will
always
lie
about
the
first
money
he
gets
for
it
s
a
question
of
knowing
not
of
thinking
said
dick
exactly
returned
dickinson
bitterly
and
this
is
the
way
you
know
me
if
my
running
hasn
t
given
any
better
impression
of
me
than
that
i
ll
stop
it
altogether
i
never
wanted
to
run
you
drove
me
into
it
against
my
will
i
will
slip
out
with
hang
it
jim
answer
my
question
won
t
you
cried
dick
desperate
did
you
run
last
summer
in
a
fourth
of
july
race
with
professionals
or
not
of
course
i
didn
t
replied
dickinson
sulkily
you
ought
to
have
more
sense
than
to
take
stock
in
such
a
yarn
i
never
ran
a
race
in
my
life
except
in
this
school
and
at
hillbury
last
melvin
drew
a
long
breath
his
courage
was
coming
back
and
his
wrath
was
cooling
but
the
mystery
was
yet
to
be
explained
how
did
this
story
start
then
what
story
snapped
dickinson
why
that
you
did
take
part
in
some
such
race
in
your
town
last
summer
returned
dick
patiently
yet
feeling
that
dickinson
s
present
balkiness
certainly
warranted
suspicion
of
past
folly
if
not
of
guilt
i
don
t
know
anything
about
any
story
answered
dickinson
i
was
asked
to
run
in
the
races
and
declined
through
some
misunderstanding
my
name
was
mentioned
in
the
advertisements
but
i
did
not
run
fact
was
not
even
was
your
name
down
in
the
handbills
it
may
have
been
i
don
t
know
about
who
was
the
manager
i
don
t
recall
his
of
the
sporting
men
around
town
i
know
the
name
of
the
head
of
the
general
committee
and
that
s
would
he
be
able
to
give
us
a
certificate
proving
that
you
did
not
compete
he
s
in
europe
answered
dickinson
he
wouldn
t
be
of
any
use
if
he
were
here
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
sports
at
all
and
he
doesn
t
know
me
from
but
there
must
be
some
one
to
whom
you
can
write
for
evidence
cried
melvin
in
despair
wouldn
t
your
father
look
the
matter
up
for
you
or
your
clergyman
or
your
high
school
principal
dickinson
s
features
relaxed
into
a
mournful
smile
my
father
indeed
haven
t
i
told
you
of
his
attitude
on
the
subject
he
d
welcome
any
pretext
that
would
shut
me
out
and
as
for
monroe
our
minister
he
s
a
fine
old
man
and
one
of
the
best
friends
i
have
in
the
world
but
i
shouldn
t
wish
to
send
him
round
the
streets
looking
up
evidence
regarding
my
running
the
principal
of
the
high
school
would
do
the
job
thoroughly
if
we
could
give
him
plenty
of
time
but
he
s
a
very
busy
man
and
might
not
get
to
it
might
not
get
to
it
immediately
echoed
melvin
why
jim
do
you
know
how
much
time
we
have
five
days
the
protest
will
have
to
be
met
on
wednesday
if
we
are
not
prepared
then
judgment
will
go
against
they
ll
have
to
give
us
reasonable
time
in
which
to
disprove
charges
won
t
they
retorted
dickinson
they
certainly
don
t
expect
every
fellow
to
carry
round
in
his
pocket
certificates
of
his
amateur
the
rules
say
definitely
that
protests
must
be
decided
on
the
wednesday
before
the
games
and
hillbury
will
take
good
care
that
the
rules
are
followed
whatever
we
do
must
be
done
before
wednesday
we
must
write
the
letters
let
s
talk
it
over
with
varrell
first
said
dickinson
he
knows
more
than
all
the
rest
of
us
put
together
it
may
be
that
he
will
think
of
some
way
of
getting
us
out
of
the
the
meeting
was
adjourned
to
varrell
s
room
where
the
facts
were
discussed
again
the
wisdom
of
varrell
furnished
no
other
expedient
than
that
already
proposed
of
writing
to
several
men
whose
names
dickinson
had
mentioned
in
the
hope
that
out
of
the
whole
number
at
least
one
would
answer
fully
and
promptly
with
evidence
that
could
not
be
gainsaid
late
in
the
evening
the
captain
and
the
manager
separated
having
written
the
letters
and
made
sure
of
their
prompt
departure
by
carrying
them
to
the
office
instead
of
leaving
them
in
the
street
boxes
anxious
as
the
boys
were
to
speed
the
cause
there
was
nothing
now
left
to
them
but
to
wait
quietly
for
the
returning
messages
and
control
their
impatience
as
best
they
could
to
dickinson
whose
temperament
inclined
to
moroseness
this
waiting
was
not
so
difficult
he
had
always
shown
an
inconceivable
indifference
to
the
athletic
ambition
which
was
so
powerful
an
animus
in
the
lives
of
the
boys
about
him
the
immediate
effect
of
the
unpleasant
news
was
to
change
his
indifference
to
disgust
the
accusation
was
groundless
and
unjust
if
he
must
prove
his
innocence
against
every
absurd
charge
which
could
be
suddenly
trumped
up
against
him
the
sooner
he
was
done
with
athletics
the
better
the
game
was
not
worth
the
candle
weary
of
the
disagreeable
subject
dickinson
went
to
bed
and
fell
quickly
asleep
not
so
the
unfortunate
manager
to
him
the
fleet
runner
was
a
school
possession
intrusted
to
his
keeping
as
a
fine
blade
to
the
care
of
the
armorer
who
must
produce
it
at
the
call
of
its
owner
glittering
keen
and
ready
for
instant
use
he
heard
the
clock
strike
twelve
and
one
as
he
rolled
nervously
from
one
side
of
the
bed
to
the
other
vainly
courting
elusive
sleep
or
brooding
over
the
perplexing
situation
dickinson
might
not
have
suggested
the
right
men
to
appeal
to
the
letters
might
not
reach
their
destination
safely
the
people
to
whom
they
were
addressed
might
not
answer
promptly
the
committee
might
not
give
proper
weight
to
the
answers
received
he
recalled
with
alarm
stories
he
had
read
in
newspapers
of
the
accidental
destruction
of
mail
cars
the
letters
would
be
forwarded
together
an
accident
to
a
single
pouch
would
stop
them
all
he
groaned
aloud
as
he
pictured
himself
and
dickinson
and
the
school
waiting
hopeful
and
helpless
day
after
day
mail
after
mail
for
letters
which
having
never
been
sent
could
never
arrive
varrell
also
was
awake
late
stretched
in
his
with
feet
comfortably
cushioned
on
the
he
gazed
out
into
the
peaceful
night
and
pondered
the
same
problem
which
was
distressing
his
friend
when
at
length
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
turned
up
the
light
there
was
the
shadow
of
a
smile
on
his
face
and
a
gleam
of
satisfaction
in
his
eye
which
indicated
that
one
at
least
of
the
three
seniors
had
cudgeled
his
brain
to
some
purpose
the
trio
came
together
next
morning
on
the
way
to
chapel
did
you
get
the
letters
off
asked
varrell
melvin
nodded
did
you
write
to
the
newspapers
continued
varrell
the
newspaper
men
are
usually
best
posted
on
local
manager
and
captain
looked
at
each
other
in
surprise
we
didn
t
think
of
them
confessed
dickinson
there
s
the
and
the
some
one
in
those
offices
ought
to
know
the
facts
perfectly
i
ll
write
to
them
both
immediately
after
chapel
said
melvin
joyfully
much
obliged
wrenn
i
knew
you
d
help
while
melvin
composed
his
letters
varrell
was
at
the
telegraph
office
sending
messages
to
the
same
addresses
but
he
kept
his
own
counsel
the
school
sports
were
held
on
saturday
with
rather
disappointing
results
dickinson
won
his
races
as
was
expected
but
he
made
no
new
records
and
his
form
was
evidently
not
as
good
as
he
had
shown
in
the
same
sports
a
year
before
the
school
was
disappointed
but
not
hopelessly
so
for
marks
s
expert
opinion
that
dickinson
had
reached
his
limit
and
would
now
go
backward
found
no
general
acceptance
outside
his
own
small
set
melvin
won
second
place
in
the
high
jump
barely
succeeding
in
doing
five
feet
five
though
in
practice
the
week
before
he
had
several
times
got
easily
over
the
bar
at
five
feet
six
it
was
little
comfort
to
him
to
know
as
the
others
did
not
that
his
slump
was
due
not
to
inability
but
to
anxiety
for
dickinson
varrell
alone
of
the
three
gained
glory
by
the
work
of
the
day
winning
his
event
by
a
vault
only
a
trifle
below
the
school
record
that
night
came
formal
notice
of
the
protest
of
dickinson
to
be
adjudicated
on
the
following
wednesday
the
news
flashed
through
the
school
with
the
usual
electrifying
force
charging
every
loyal
heart
with
dismay
and
indignation
illustration
in
the
campus
woods
chapter
xxii
the
decision
of
the
court
we
certainly
ought
to
hear
said
melvin
on
monday
as
with
phil
and
dickinson
he
hung
round
the
office
waiting
for
the
mail
to
be
distributed
if
the
letters
arrived
saturday
and
the
people
attended
to
the
matter
promptly
the
answers
might
have
been
mailed
saturday
more
likely
they
didn
t
arrive
until
saturday
night
or
this
morning
replied
dickinson
who
took
a
less
optimistic
view
then
if
the
people
are
like
most
others
when
you
ask
them
for
a
favor
they
ll
get
round
to
the
thing
on
tuesday
or
later
and
the
letters
may
arrive
on
thursday
or
any
time
during
the
following
indeed
they
are
written
at
nothing
for
melvin
nothing
for
dickinson
two
papers
for
varrell
dick
s
heart
sank
we
have
all
day
and
the
first
mail
on
wednesday
he
said
at
length
as
the
trio
turned
gloomily
homeward
a
figure
passed
them
on
the
other
side
of
the
lane
hurrying
toward
the
office
here
are
a
couple
of
papers
for
you
varrell
called
phil
but
varrell
was
already
past
unresponsive
to
the
hail
throw
them
at
him
growled
dickinson
he
never
hears
anything
when
his
back
is
phil
hit
the
mark
and
varrell
stooped
for
the
parcels
not
a
letter
wrenn
not
a
blamed
letter
for
any
of
us
just
these
papers
for
you
i
felt
like
throwing
them
into
the
river
i
m
glad
you
didn
t
replied
varrell
studying
the
postmark
i
ll
take
half
a
loaf
any
time
even
if
you
fellows
get
no
bread
old
newspapers
are
sometimes
tuesday
was
not
a
day
of
profitable
study
for
melvin
he
went
to
his
recitations
but
in
some
he
got
excused
and
in
others
he
blundered
most
shabbily
his
whole
attention
was
given
to
waiting
on
the
mails
in
the
morning
nothing
in
the
afternoon
nothing
at
night
a
single
bescrawled
envelope
bearing
the
postmark
ralston
indiana
the
jewel
at
last
grinned
varrell
as
he
read
the
address
over
melvin
s
shoulder
open
the
case
it
isn
t
a
joking
matter
replied
dick
seriously
a
good
deal
hangs
on
this
dirt
especially
said
varrell
come
open
it
up
melvin
cut
the
envelope
carefully
and
brought
the
following
to
light
this
is
to
sertify
that
jim
dickson
did
not
run
in
the
july
sports
as
advertysed
yours
resply
michael
ryan
is
that
all
asked
varrell
melvin
examined
again
i
m
afraid
he
couldn
t
pass
english
a
said
varrell
they
walked
for
some
minutes
in
silence
melvin
too
much
disgusted
with
his
companion
s
flippancy
to
speak
if
you
can
talk
seriously
i
d
like
to
ask
you
something
he
said
at
length
but
i
don
t
want
any
more
i
m
serious
replied
varrell
gravely
what
do
you
think
of
it
will
they
take
it
or
not
i
m
afraid
it
s
no
good
said
varrell
what
they
want
is
evidence
complete
and
certain
that
can
t
be
dodged
or
questioned
or
denied
this
is
proof
only
to
those
who
will
accept
its
authority
it
isn
t
what
they
call
melvin
groaned
you
might
at
least
have
spared
me
a
word
like
the
grin
stole
back
upon
varrell
s
face
melvin
turned
away
indignant
and
disheartened
varrell
clutched
the
youth
by
the
arm
dick
don
t
go
off
mad
i
m
not
so
useless
as
i
seem
come
up
to
the
room
and
let
me
show
you
ten
minutes
later
the
athletic
manager
came
plunging
down
the
stairs
four
steps
at
a
time
his
face
aglow
with
smiles
his
whole
being
radiant
with
the
joy
that
follows
a
disappointment
as
the
sun
comes
forth
more
glorious
after
slow
dark
days
of
northeast
storm
the
old
rascal
he
muttered
the
shrewd
old
foxy
rascal
and
he
s
had
the
thing
in
his
pocket
all
day
i
felt
like
kicking
him
and
hugging
him
at
the
same
time
if
i
could
only
have
a
try
at
the
high
jump
now
couldn
t
i
do
six
feet
two
flights
down
across
the
yard
two
flights
up
he
found
dickinson
with
his
nose
in
a
dictionary
of
antiquities
packing
away
learning
by
the
cubic
inch
the
nose
came
out
in
a
trice
when
it
went
back
a
good
half
hour
afterward
it
had
lost
somewhat
the
keenness
of
its
scent
for
facts
and
the
two
eyes
above
it
gleamed
bright
and
determined
thence
the
manager
hied
him
home
to
bed
and
slept
nine
solid
refreshing
hours
the
official
student
representative
on
the
athletic
committee
was
the
captain
of
the
team
as
dickinson
was
naturally
excluded
from
the
discussion
by
the
fact
that
his
own
name
was
under
protest
melvin
was
to
take
his
place
he
was
accompanied
to
the
station
by
curtis
and
varrell
rub
it
in
if
you
get
the
chance
said
curtis
savagely
it
s
one
of
their
tricks
don
t
spare
i
hope
you
ll
do
no
such
thing
said
the
pacific
varrell
it
wouldn
t
be
either
courteous
or
safe
i
believe
they
re
quite
square
about
the
thing
and
you
must
assume
that
they
are
anyway
even
if
you
think
i
agree
with
you
said
dick
thoughtfully
the
advertisement
certainly
gives
a
very
strong
ground
for
suspicion
and
our
case
isn
t
so
sure
that
we
can
afford
to
stir
up
any
unpleasant
the
main
thing
is
to
go
carefully
and
arouse
as
little
opposition
as
possible
continued
varrell
stick
to
the
plan
we
laid
out
if
you
the
train
came
roaring
and
clanking
in
don
t
let
em
fool
you
anyway
said
curtis
giving
a
hard
grip
to
the
manager
s
arm
come
back
victorious
or
we
ll
lynch
and
don
t
play
your
trump
card
first
added
varrell
the
meeting
was
held
in
boston
the
committee
was
composed
of
six
members
one
from
the
students
one
from
the
faculty
and
one
from
the
alumni
of
each
school
hillbury
was
represented
by
professor
loder
harkins
a
shrewd
lawyer
and
captain
mcgee
of
the
hillbury
track
team
for
seaton
appeared
besides
melvin
pope
to
represent
the
faculty
and
brayton
a
young
boston
surgeon
who
with
all
the
engagements
and
responsibilities
of
a
busy
practice
was
still
willing
to
undergo
some
sacrifice
to
serve
his
school
pope
was
made
chairman
and
professor
loder
secretary
our
business
is
to
decide
concerning
the
protest
made
by
the
hillbury
manager
against
dickinson
said
the
chairman
i
will
read
the
protest
and
then
ask
harkins
who
is
used
to
presenting
cases
in
court
to
make
a
statement
of
the
i
m
used
to
appearing
as
attorney
not
as
judge
returned
the
lawyer
smiling
here
we
are
acting
in
a
judicial
dick
studied
the
lawyer
s
face
as
the
protest
was
read
and
came
speedily
to
the
conclusion
that
he
should
like
harkins
less
as
judge
than
as
attorney
the
face
was
mobile
and
intelligent
yet
something
in
its
lines
suggested
unscrupulousness
dick
had
but
little
time
in
which
to
gain
this
impression
for
harkins
s
words
rather
than
his
face
now
received
his
whole
attention
the
charge
briefly
stated
is
that
dickinson
has
been
associated
with
professional
runners
in
an
open
race
contrary
to
the
most
fundamental
rule
of
amateur
when
and
where
inquired
brayton
turning
to
the
hillbury
captain
on
july
fourth
of
last
year
in
ralston
indiana
replied
mcgee
promptly
what
is
your
source
of
information
the
advertisements
harkins
will
you
kindly
pass
the
poster
to
brayton
it
was
a
notice
such
as
one
frequently
sees
displayed
in
shop
windows
announcing
among
other
attractions
a
race
for
a
prize
of
fifteen
dollars
in
which
smith
doyle
jackson
and
j
dickinson
who
holds
many
school
and
college
records
would
compete
the
fateful
poster
passed
from
hand
to
hand
about
the
table
dick
awaited
his
turn
with
curiosity
yet
with
a
heavy
sinking
of
the
heart
was
it
possible
that
this
miserable
sheet
of
coarse
paper
should
have
power
to
work
so
much
harm
what
answer
does
dickinson
make
said
brayton
at
length
turning
to
melvin
he
denies
that
he
has
ever
run
in
any
race
in
his
life
except
in
the
seaton
and
hillbury
contests
answered
melvin
speaking
with
a
little
tremor
in
his
voice
but
yet
composedly
and
coolly
the
advertisement
was
made
without
his
consent
or
while
it
may
seem
invidious
to
question
the
sufficiency
of
a
man
s
word
said
harkins
with
a
bland
smile
i
think
you
gentlemen
will
all
agree
with
me
that
we
should
be
false
to
our
duty
if
we
accepted
dickinson
s
unsupported
denial
as
a
conclusive
answer
to
the
of
course
replied
brayton
promptly
the
only
question
is
where
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
defendant
i
should
say
very
positively
said
professor
loder
we
are
striving
to
maintain
our
contests
on
such
a
high
plane
that
not
a
breath
of
suspicion
can
be
cast
on
the
amateur
standing
of
any
one
who
competes
in
them
this
advertisement
has
thrown
serious
doubts
on
the
eligibility
of
dickinson
for
the
school
sports
it
is
for
him
to
clear
himself
of
a
moment
s
silence
followed
before
harkins
spoke
again
if
i
may
be
allowed
another
word
i
should
like
to
add
that
the
principle
to
be
followed
is
not
the
maxim
of
the
criminal
courts
it
is
better
that
nine
guilty
men
escape
rather
than
that
one
innocent
man
should
suffer
the
famous
direction
of
president
grant
let
no
guilty
man
escape
less
harm
is
done
by
barring
five
unfairly
than
by
allowing
one
to
compete
who
has
forfeited
his
you
and
i
were
not
so
sure
about
that
twenty
years
ago
said
brayton
with
a
smile
if
you
displace
a
man
unjustly
you
interfere
with
the
equality
of
the
representation
and
the
contests
are
again
unfair
what
we
are
after
here
is
the
facts
in
the
case
we
all
agree
that
this
poster
raises
a
reasonable
doubt
as
to
the
eligibility
of
dickinson
is
this
all
we
are
to
know
about
it
mr
melvin
has
some
counter
evidence
to
put
in
said
the
chairman
dick
awoke
with
a
start
he
had
been
so
much
absorbed
in
following
the
argument
of
the
older
members
of
the
committee
that
he
had
for
the
moment
forgotten
the
task
devolving
on
him
i
think
i
ought
to
say
remarked
melvin
as
he
drew
from
his
pocket
the
illiterate
missive
of
michael
ryan
that
this
protest
was
entirely
unexpected
and
we
were
allowed
a
very
short
time
in
which
to
prepare
a
defence
if
we
had
not
heard
of
it
by
chance
a
day
or
two
before
the
notice
came
we
should
have
had
absolutely
nothing
to
i
am
sorry
to
hear
that
said
professor
loder
looking
sharply
at
mcgee
that
seems
we
didn
t
find
it
out
until
late
said
mcgee
reddening
and
then
we
had
to
call
a
we
wrote
to
ralston
immediately
continued
melvin
and
have
received
this
certificate
from
the
manager
of
the
athletic
sports
referred
to
in
the
poster
if
there
had
been
more
time
we
should
probably
have
more
letters
to
he
handed
the
scrawl
to
the
chairman
who
gave
it
a
glance
and
passed
it
to
brayton
the
latter
smiled
over
it
and
handed
it
to
his
neighbor
so
it
developed
smiles
as
it
went
the
round
until
all
were
smiling
except
dick
whose
face
was
purple
with
confusion
but
bitterly
stern
i
d
like
to
see
this
put
in
as
evidence
in
a
court
of
law
chuckled
harkins
it
bears
neither
date
nor
attestation
concerns
one
dickson
not
dickinson
and
gives
no
hint
as
to
michael
s
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
michael
could
explain
himself
if
he
were
here
said
brayton
thoughtfully
you
certainly
wouldn
t
give
weight
to
an
indefinite
unauthenticated
certificate
like
that
protested
harkins
yes
if
i
were
convinced
that
it
represented
a
genuine
attempt
to
give
the
information
we
ask
replied
brayton
i
don
t
know
whether
to
take
this
seriously
or
what
evidence
should
you
consider
sufficient
to
disprove
the
charge
asked
pope
turning
to
harkins
dick
gave
the
teacher
a
grateful
look
it
was
the
question
he
wanted
to
ask
harkins
was
momentarily
at
a
loss
his
interest
was
all
on
the
negative
side
why
any
trustworthy
record
of
the
day
s
events
which
showed
that
dickinson
did
not
take
there
probably
was
no
official
report
dick
ventured
to
say
well
any
definite
statement
by
reliable
people
who
were
in
a
position
to
know
said
professor
loder
a
newspaper
report
of
the
day
s
events
perhaps
suggested
dick
trying
to
control
his
eagerness
yes
if
it
were
definite
assented
the
professor
well
here
is
a
paper
published
in
ralston
on
the
sixth
of
july
and
while
it
describes
the
games
and
names
the
contestants
it
makes
no
mention
of
brayton
took
the
paper
and
examined
the
passage
carefully
then
turned
it
over
to
professor
loder
and
harkins
who
put
their
heads
together
over
it
at
length
the
lawyer
looked
up
with
a
gracious
smile
and
said
in
his
smoothest
judicial
tones
i
am
sorry
melvin
but
this
is
by
no
means
conclusive
certain
names
of
contestants
are
given
with
their
places
at
the
finish
but
there
is
nothing
here
to
prove
that
dickinson
did
not
start
and
fall
so
far
behind
as
not
to
finish
i
am
sorry
to
disappoint
you
but
i
should
hardly
feel
justified
myself
in
accepting
this
negative
evidence
as
confuting
the
plain
statement
of
the
then
the
report
of
the
proceedings
would
prove
nothing
after
all
said
dick
bitterly
professor
loder
has
just
said
that
the
newspaper
report
would
be
it
would
replied
harkins
with
forbearance
if
it
had
contained
the
plain
statement
that
dickinson
did
not
is
that
your
idea
too
asked
dick
turning
to
professor
loder
the
boy
s
heart
was
fluttering
his
hands
and
knees
shook
under
the
table
but
his
voice
was
steady
and
for
this
he
felt
unspeakably
grateful
certainly
said
professor
loder
with
some
sharpness
in
his
voice
we
do
not
demand
the
impossible
if
the
newspaper
had
stated
that
dickinson
did
not
run
there
would
be
nothing
more
to
then
there
nothing
more
to
say
declared
dick
leaping
to
his
feet
in
his
eagerness
to
relieve
the
nervous
tension
which
had
been
growing
more
and
more
acute
as
the
discussion
went
on
here
is
the
which
makes
that
very
harkins
seized
the
paper
and
studied
the
passage
with
evident
chagrin
he
was
still
studying
not
wholly
hopeless
of
a
flaw
when
professor
loder
after
looking
over
the
lawyer
s
shoulder
at
the
paragraph
said
yes
that
seems
to
settle
it
the
protest
must
be
withdrawn
i
am
sorry
however
that
you
could
not
have
been
more
frank
with
dick
flushed
deep
red
i
hope
sir
you
don
t
think
i
ve
taken
an
underhand
course
i
only
meant
to
make
sure
that
the
newspaper
statement
would
be
accepted
as
sufficient
evidence
you
see
sir
i
am
positive
that
dickinson
is
innocent
because
i
know
him
and
trust
him
but
i
couldn
t
tell
how
the
evidence
would
appeal
to
and
so
you
committed
us
first
and
then
put
in
the
evidence
said
brayton
the
fact
is
professor
loder
that
the
great
danger
in
these
discussions
lies
not
in
any
difference
in
ideals
but
in
the
vagueness
of
our
notions
as
to
what
constitutes
proof
of
guilt
or
innocence
i
am
inclined
to
think
melvin
s
method
has
tended
to
bring
us
sooner
to
an
professor
loder
made
no
reply
the
passed
slowly
around
the
table
harkins
conceived
some
new
plan
and
returned
to
the
discussion
to
tell
the
truth
i
don
t
like
this
kind
of
evidence
he
began
solemnly
professor
loder
gave
him
a
look
of
disapproval
i
don
t
see
how
you
can
honestly
object
to
it
it
is
of
the
same
kind
as
that
of
the
poster
but
much
more
definite
and
the
words
brought
a
glint
of
gratitude
and
respect
into
the
seaton
manager
s
eyes
it
was
apparent
that
there
were
fair
and
honest
men
in
the
hillbury
faculty
as
well
as
at
seaton
is
this
the
only
case
cited
under
the
charge
asked
harkins
turning
with
impatience
to
mcgee
the
only
one
i
know
of
answered
the
lad
harkins
relapsed
into
silence
am
i
then
to
assume
that
we
have
reached
a
definite
conclusion
asked
the
chairman
i
move
that
the
committee
report
itself
satisfied
as
to
the
groundlessness
of
the
charges
and
that
the
hillbury
manager
be
given
leave
to
withdraw
the
protest
said
professor
loder
promptly
the
motion
was
put
and
unanimously
carried
the
meeting
broke
up
harkins
alleged
important
business
offered
a
general
farewell
and
hurriedly
departed
dick
lingered
to
thank
professor
loder
and
brayton
for
their
courtesy
and
fairness
arranged
with
mcgee
a
few
details
concerning
the
games
and
then
hastened
to
the
telegraph
office
to
send
the
joyful
news
ahead
he
was
received
by
the
boys
that
night
as
a
victorious
diplomat
returning
from
an
international
congress
the
only
circumstance
to
mar
his
complete
happiness
was
the
reluctance
of
the
school
to
believe
that
varrell
and
varrell
alone
deserved
the
credit
for
securing
the
evidence
and
for
the
successful
presentation
of
it
chapter
xxiii
the
great
track
meet
two
days
of
uneasiness
and
discussion
and
the
momentous
saturday
was
at
hand
the
indifference
which
melvin
felt
at
the
beginning
of
the
season
when
the
responsibilities
of
the
management
were
loaded
upon
his
shoulders
had
long
since
vanished
he
had
begun
with
it
as
a
task
as
a
burden
to
be
borne
because
he
could
bear
it
better
than
any
one
else
he
had
put
into
it
the
best
of
his
energy
and
the
best
of
his
thought
he
had
worried
and
sacrificed
and
labored
for
the
cause
it
seemed
to
him
now
almost
as
if
the
team
were
his
struggling
for
him
and
for
the
school
his
anxiety
could
not
have
been
greater
if
his
own
future
happiness
and
the
welfare
of
the
school
had
really
been
dependent
on
the
success
of
the
team
from
the
moment
the
news
was
received
that
the
protest
had
been
rejected
dickinson
ceased
to
be
a
mere
ornament
to
the
team
and
became
a
real
captain
there
was
fire
in
him
now
and
determination
and
genuine
enthusiasm
his
whole
attitude
was
one
of
confidence
and
of
conscious
power
that
lifted
the
weakest
man
in
the
squad
out
of
his
humiliating
sense
of
incapacity
and
made
him
feel
that
he
was
one
of
a
strong
company
led
by
a
strong
man
and
himself
capable
of
greater
things
than
he
had
ever
yet
accomplished
in
the
of
the
school
the
night
before
the
games
when
the
boys
gathered
in
loyal
force
to
give
their
team
a
for
the
morrow
nothing
that
was
said
by
student
or
graduate
or
friend
stirred
such
response
in
the
hearts
of
the
school
as
the
short
plain
virile
exhortation
of
the
captain
and
no
athletes
need
personal
inspiration
as
do
the
members
of
a
track
team
the
football
player
stands
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
his
fellows
the
strong
helps
the
weak
and
shares
with
him
the
glory
of
victory
the
baseball
score
may
show
hits
and
errors
against
the
same
member
of
a
winning
team
the
runner
on
the
other
hand
enters
the
field
alone
fights
his
brief
battle
unaided
and
either
fails
his
team
wholly
or
makes
an
individual
contribution
to
its
success
he
can
not
be
pushed
on
to
victory
by
the
efforts
of
another
the
wind
was
easterly
on
saturday
bringing
in
from
the
sea
a
heavy
thickness
of
atmosphere
yet
with
barely
sufficient
vitality
to
move
the
leaves
the
air
chilled
like
a
march
fog
what
do
you
think
of
it
asked
melvin
as
he
met
dickinson
at
breakfast
the
weather
it
s
bad
on
the
nerves
but
worse
for
the
hillburyites
who
aren
t
used
to
it
as
we
are
i
don
t
mind
it
myself
all
i
ask
is
that
we
have
no
wind
to
buck
against
and
no
it
s
hard
on
the
jumpers
when
the
air
is
cold
and
heavy
you
can
t
put
any
force
into
your
weather
doesn
t
influence
me
as
much
as
other
conditions
do
said
varrell
i
find
it
a
great
deal
easier
to
jump
when
there
s
a
big
eager
crowd
and
the
excitement
runs
you
ll
have
excitement
enough
if
that
s
all
you
want
said
dick
grimly
this
hillbury
team
is
coming
up
here
to
win
i
happen
to
know
that
they
re
counting
on
some
of
the
very
events
that
we
ve
been
reckoning
as
surely
ours
if
we
beat
hillbury
we
shall
have
to
make
new
records
to
do
let
s
have
the
new
records
then
by
all
means
said
varrell
looking
across
the
table
at
the
silent
captain
on
the
way
to
chapel
tompkins
joined
them
good
speech
you
made
last
night
jimmy
said
the
pitcher
better
than
anything
i
heard
at
the
prize
dickinson
nodded
in
acknowledgment
of
the
compliment
you
can
t
fail
us
after
that
speech
continued
tompkins
i
know
a
couple
of
fellows
in
hillbury
and
they
brag
of
ropes
and
lary
like
an
agent
selling
a
gold
mine
don
t
let
them
do
you
they
won
t
unless
they
re
better
men
if
they
are
we
want
them
to
not
exactly
returned
tompkins
let
the
best
team
win
of
course
only
make
sure
we
don
t
melvin
snorted
in
ridicule
you
crazy
cowboy
how
can
we
help
losing
if
the
best
team
is
hillbury
and
hillbury
wins
you
don
t
mean
that
we
re
to
beat
them
dishonestly
my
meaning
is
too
deep
for
gladiatorial
brains
like
yours
said
tommy
edging
off
i
ll
explain
the
hillburyites
came
by
a
special
train
in
solid
phalanx
happy
and
hopeful
the
year
s
records
were
in
their
favor
by
a
considerable
margin
dickinson
and
curtis
were
the
only
men
really
feared
for
todd
they
considered
as
good
as
beaten
and
the
rest
of
the
seaton
team
while
allowed
a
certain
number
of
points
in
accordance
with
the
general
principle
of
chance
were
assessed
at
a
low
valuation
at
two
the
seaton
bleachers
packed
to
their
full
capacity
were
bellowing
their
welcome
to
the
men
who
had
just
appeared
at
the
head
of
the
stretch
lary
the
hillbury
champion
and
dickinson
were
side
by
side
former
a
short
solid
muscular
figure
quick
in
every
motion
the
latter
tall
and
lithe
and
deliberate
even
to
slowness
melvin
watched
the
preparations
with
an
unexpected
fear
creeping
into
his
heart
was
this
solid
person
with
the
knotty
legs
and
confident
manner
to
steal
a
start
on
the
seaton
captain
and
keep
ahead
to
the
finish
crack
sounded
the
pistol
and
away
went
the
men
rising
from
the
crouching
position
with
an
instantaneous
leap
and
throwing
themselves
forward
into
their
strides
it
was
true
lary
was
ahead
at
the
start
by
five
yards
his
flashing
over
the
unscarred
surface
of
the
track
as
the
wings
of
a
buzzing
insect
beat
the
air
him
dickinson
and
travers
and
behind
still
farther
the
second
hillbury
runner
who
did
not
count
in
the
score
for
five
seconds
the
three
came
on
with
the
same
apparent
interval
then
number
two
crept
away
from
number
three
and
up
toward
number
one
eight
seconds
nine
ten
the
registered
a
fraction
more
and
the
short
sprinter
was
at
the
tape
dickinson
but
six
inches
behind
and
travers
in
third
place
how
the
visitors
howled
at
this
the
first
augury
of
the
day
s
success
the
great
dickinson
beaten
in
the
very
first
race
the
announcer
s
big
megaphone
roared
forth
the
record
equalled
the
best
of
either
school
the
points
five
seaton
chalked
on
the
board
and
the
crowd
like
a
hungry
dog
who
waits
greedily
for
a
second
piece
of
meat
turned
expectant
to
the
next
event
the
was
conceded
to
willbur
of
hillbury
in
the
seaton
estimates
however
maine
of
seaton
had
been
counted
on
to
win
second
place
and
faxon
third
willbur
ran
a
beautiful
race
that
set
the
hillburyites
wild
with
pride
establishing
a
new
dual
record
but
unfortunately
for
seaton
the
second
man
who
was
twenty
yards
behind
proved
to
be
not
maine
but
towle
of
hillbury
while
maine
made
a
very
poor
third
the
score
went
twelve
seaton
the
hearts
of
the
seatonians
down
the
beginning
was
bad
meantime
the
which
had
been
started
with
the
first
run
was
drawing
near
its
end
here
at
last
was
encouragement
for
the
home
team
for
every
prize
fell
to
the
wearer
of
a
red
curtis
was
ahead
as
usual
with

a
big
two
hundred
pounder

and
trapp
third
we
ve
evened
it
up
now
toddy
cried
melvin
joyfully
as
the
men
came
out
for
the
high
hurdles
we
want
seven
points
here
you
i
ll
do
my
best
said
todd
that
s
all
any
one
can
do
that
rawson
may
beat
me
after
all
they
say
he
can
do
it
in
seventeen
nonsense
retorted
melvin
go
in
and
beat
the
start
was
in
the
hillbury
man
s
favor
rawson
flew
down
the
stretch
knocking
over
half
his
hurdles
in
his
course
going
like
a
torpedo
boat
in
a
rough
sea
just
behind
him
came
todd
taking
three
swift
strides
between
hurdles
and
rising
like
a
bird
swooping
up
in
its
flight
they
seemed
neck
and
neck
at
the
last
obstacle
but
here
rawson
struck
hard
and
lost
his
stride
and
todd
was
easily
first
at
the
finish
smith
of
seaton
was
third
making
the
score
hillbury
fourteen
seaton
eighteen
now
s
your
chance
for
revenge
said
curtis
as
dickinson
started
forth
for
the
show
those
fellows
what
you
can
do
when
you
really
have
room
to
get
headway
and
we
shouldn
t
object
to
a
new
record
you
the
captain
smiled
grimly
i
shall
be
satisfied
to
dickinson
took
his
place
with
travers
and
ropes
and
lary
at
the
starting
line
where
the
curve
of
the
track
began
they
were
a
quartet
lary
was
fresh
from
his
victory
in
the
hundred
travers
had
prizes
from
contests
of
previous
years
ropes
was
a
new
man
hailed
by
the
hillbury
coachers
as
a
coming
champion
to
dickinson
it
seemed
the
race
of
his
life
so
eager
was
he
to
atone
for
the
disappointment
he
had
given
his
schoolmates
in
his
first
race
the
runners
got
off
in
pairs
travers
and
lary
ahead
ropes
and
dickinson
side
by
side
gathering
headway
in
the
rear
around
the
curve
it
seemed
that
travers
was
ahead
but
as
the
runners
struck
the
straightaway
they
were
seen
to
tail
out
into
a
diagonal
line
across
the
track
lary
leading
then
travers
then
ropes
and
dickinson
last
the
hillburyites
seeing
the
dreaded
champion
in
the
rear
emitted
an
incoherent
howl
of
exultation
will
you
look
at
that
cried
curtis
who
stood
by
melvin
near
the
finish
line
outclassed
as
sure
as
guns
no
no
watch
it
out
cried
dick
in
answer
down
the
track
swept
the
line
of
shaking
struggling
figures
when
it
passed
the
seaton
benches
dick
could
see
the
excited
spectators
throw
up
their
arms
could
hear
the
yells
and
guess
that
the
were
putting
the
ground
behind
them
a
moment
more
and
he
knew
that
the
struggle
was
between
ropes
and
dickinson
for
the
lead
and
then
as
the
white
figures
flashed
by
he
saw
that
the
racers
had
tailed
out
again
in
the
reverse
order
dickinson
ropes
travers
and
lary
and
so
the
judges
reported
them
in
the
finish
score
seaton
hillbury
sixteen
as
the
mile
runners
came
out
melvin
had
word
that
the
captain
wished
to
see
him
he
found
dickinson
in
the
dressing
rooms
under
the
hands
of
the
rubber
that
was
splendid
old
man
perfectly
splendid
began
the
manager
dickinson
checked
him
i
didn
t
bring
you
in
here
to
tell
me
that
stuff
it
s
something
serious
do
you
know
we
re
not
doing
well
i
don
t
blame
any
one
of
course
we
ve
won
certain
points
but
there
are
those
field
events
at
the
end
of
the
list
that
we
aren
t
at
all
sure
of
we
must
get
down
to
them
with
a
good
margin
or
we
ll
be
dick
nodded
silently
the
high
jump
was
to
be
the
last
event
he
did
not
need
to
be
told
that
his
chance
of
winning
this
was
very
problematical
now
i
m
entered
for
the
broad
jump
said
the
captain
i
put
my
name
down
because
it
did
no
harm
to
have
it
there
and
occasionally
you
know
i
ve
made
a
good
jump
i
m
wondering
if
i
hadn
t
better
go
in
and
try
two
or
three
times
on
the
chance
of
adding
a
point
or
two
to
the
but
the
exclaimed
melvin
that
comes
right
that
s
the
point
is
there
any
risk
their
best
man
in
the
quarter
is
ropes
but
i
ve
run
past
him
once
and
can
do
it
again
i
don
t
feel
exhausted
at
all
and
you
know
the
quarter
is
my
run
i
have
no
confidence
that
brown
will
do
anything
at
all
in
the
broad
jump
and
hillbury
has
two
good
jumpers
at
least
shall
i
take
the
risk
of
hurting
myself
for
the
chance
of
winning
a
couple
of
points
broad
jumpers
out
sounded
the
official
warning
at
the
door
of
the
quarters
i
think
i
ll
do
it
decided
dickinson
as
melvin
hesitated
the
hillburyites
were
cheering
when
the
jumpers
came
out
the
mile
had
yielded
hillbury
five
points
and
seaton
three
still
six
ahead
said
melvin
looking
at
the
board
dickinson
took
one
feet
six
then
one
feet
two
inches
and
went
back
to
the
house
to
have
his
ankle
rubbed
again
he
did
not
learn
until
he
came
out
for
the
quarter
some
time
later
that
he
had
won
second
prize
while
brown
had
made
nothing
at
all
hillbury
had
taken
first
and
third
to
old
man
whispered
curtis
as
todd
sallied
forth
for
the
low
hurdles
they
re
crawling
up
discourage
them
can
t
you
i
don
t
know
responded
todd
quietly
i
m
not
afraid
of
rawson
but
harding
is
another
proposition
i
can
t
do
the
the
was
started
at
the
same
time
and
curtis
after
his
first
throw
found
himself
pitted
against
such
superior
men
that
his
whole
attention
was
concentrated
on
the
new
and
unpleasant
problem
of
beating
men
who
were
better
than
himself
he
did
see
the
race
for
the
hammer
men
interrupted
their
contest
a
minute
to
watch
the
hurdlers
but
about
all
his
absorbed
mind
took
in
as
the
runners
flew
by
was
a
vision
of
two
figures
with
faces
set
in
a
wild
harsh
grimace
one
bearing
blue
and
the
other
red
letters
on
his
breast
skimming
the
hurdles
with
identical
stride
like
horses
trotting
in
span
and
behind
again
more
blue
letters
and
more
red
there
was
a
tremendous
howling
in
both
camps
for
the
race
was
close
to
the
finish
and
each
side
felt
confidence
in
its
own
champion
soon
however
hillbury
ceased
to
cheer
while
seaton
broke
out
afresh
and
curtis
knew
that
todd
had
won
the
big
football
player
went
back
to
his
post
determined
not
to
fail
his
trusting
schoolmates
todd
had
won
five
points
in
the
race
just
finished
and
hillbury
three
the
score
was
now
hillbury
thirty
seaton
but
of
the
three
events
left
only
one
the
quarter
could
be
counted
safely
seaton
s
and
the
other
two
might
yield
a
big
addition
to
the
hillbury
score
it
was
in
the
present
event
that
the
games
must
be
won
eager
and
fearful
he
took
his
fourth
and
fifth
trials
still
behind
desperate
with
disappointment
poor
curtis
grasped
his
hammer
for
the
last
time
swung
it
wildly
round
and
with
all
the
strength
of
his
body
concentrated
in
one
final
convulsive
jerk
sent
it
flying
through
the
air
too
high
he
groaned
as
the
measurers
stretched
their
tape
over
the
ground
i
m
done
and
so
it
was
his
best
throw
had
given
him
barely
third
place
the
score
now
showed
a
balance
for
hillbury
of
to
discouraged
as
they
were
the
seatonian
cheerers
went
wild
again
as
dickinson
s
tall
familiar
form
emerged
once
more
upon
the
track
not
a
soul
among
them
doubted
for
a
moment
that
he
would
win
the
race
the
hillburyites
themselves
had
always
passed
over
the
event
in
their
most
optimistic
calculations
their
chances
seemed
even
less
now
for
ropes
had
already
failed
them
and
willbur
had
run
one
hard
race
in
time
and
could
not
be
in
condition
to
meet
the
champion
dickinson
himself
gave
no
attention
to
his
rivals
he
started
at
his
own
pace
a
little
below
his
maximum
but
rapid
enough
to
be
discouraging
to
the
other
contestants
and
went
fast
and
hard
as
if
he
delighted
in
the
speed
and
could
run
the
more
easily
the
faster
the
pace
the
runners
were
close
together
around
the
curve
on
the
back
stretch
willbur
forged
ahead
at
the
end
of
the
stretch
dickinson
had
barely
caught
him
and
the
two
swayed
into
the
curve
with
the
hillbury
man
on
the
inside
flying
with
a
sprinter
s
gait
with
every
muscle
strained
and
the
strength
of
every
thrown
recklessly
into
his
speed
in
a
mass
the
spectators
seaton
and
hillbury
rose
to
their
feet
and
in
a
spontaneous
discordant
howl
that
defied
the
control
of
leaders
hurled
encouragement
and
applause
at
the
struggling
pair
around
the
curve
the
blue
still
gained
at
the
opening
of
the
straightaway
still
led
by
two
yards
then
as
the
long
strides
began
to
creep
up
behind
him
the
plucky
s
pace
suddenly
slackened
he
staggered
and
fell
his
length
upon
the
track
while
kindly
arms
lifted
him
and
bore
him
away
the
tall
seatonian
swept
on
to
the
finish
and
four
seconds
later
ropes
and
watson
came
trailing
in
there
was
furious
cheering
when
the
figures
of
the
new
record
appeared
on
the
board
too
that
warms
the
heart
as
well
as
deafens
the
ears
for
seaton
cheered
first
for
their
captain
and
then
for
willbur
whose
desperate
attempt
had
driven
dickinson
to
his
best
and
hillbury
cheered
willbur
and
then
dickinson
both
sides
felt
the
better
for
this
mutual
politeness
but
the
freshly
posted
score
hillbury
seaton
and
the
advent
of
the
soon
brought
the
eager
partisans
back
to
a
consciousness
of
their
rivalry
the
bar
went
up
by
the
slow
tiresome
intervals
familiar
to
spectators
of
such
games
feet
three
nine
feet
eight
nine
feet
nine
at
ten
feet
varrell
and
phillippe
of
hillbury
alone
remained
in
the
contest
a
hillbury
man
having
gained
third
place
both
men
vaulted
ten
feet
two
but
at
ten
three
varrell
failed
and
phillippe
managed
to
wriggle
over
hillbury
had
added
six
points
to
her
score
making
to
seaton
s
and
now
for
the
final
contest
to
determine
whether
hillbury
was
to
keep
the
lead
to
the
end
there
was
a
sober
conference
at
the
seaton
quarters
as
dick
and
benson
came
forth
it
was
short
for
there
was
really
nothing
to
say
seaton
must
gain
first
place
to
tie
and
another
to
win
mcgee
of
hillbury
had
a
record
of
five
feet
eight
and
a
half
dick
had
never
jumped
more
than
five
feet
seven
the
odds
were
against
him
and
against
seaton
if
he
lost
it
would
be
the
critical
event
which
he
was
losing
and
the
splendid
work
of
todd
and
dickinson
and
others
would
go
for
nothing
keep
up
your
courage
dicky
my
boy
whispered
curtis
you
ve
beaten
him
once
about
the
protest
you
can
do
him
up
again
he
s
afraid
of
you
don
t
forget
that
keep
ahead
of
him
and
he
ll
go
to
that
this
was
foolish
talk
dick
knew
well
but
in
some
way
it
gave
him
heart
and
the
strong
cheering
from
seaton
benches
steadied
him
he
went
over
the
lower
heights
with
ease
mcgee
as
successfully
though
with
less
grace
at
five
four
dick
was
the
only
seaton
man
left
in
the
contest
while
there
were
still
two
contestants
wearing
the
blue
at
five
five
he
and
mcgee
were
alone
the
bar
now
went
up
half
an
inch
at
a
time
and
as
often
as
melvin
cleared
the
new
height
a
shout
of
relief
would
rise
from
the
seaton
benches
echoed
again
by
hillbury
when
mcgee
duplicated
the
jump
at
five
feet
seven
mcgee
failed
but
succeeded
the
second
time
at
five
seven
and
a
half
melvin
also
failed
at
first
but
cleared
on
a
second
trial
and
mcgee
wriggled
over
touching
the
bar
but
luckily
not
knocking
it
off
he
fell
in
a
heap
in
the
pit
of
soft
earth
behind
the
uprights
but
was
up
again
in
a
moment
seemingly
unhurt
the
bar
was
placed
at
five
feet
eight
if
he
fails
on
that
we
re
done
for
said
curtis
in
todd
s
ear
and
he
can
t
do
it
it
s
beyond
stop
your
croaking
retorted
todd
i
say
he
melvin
paced
his
distance
in
absolute
silence
the
leaders
of
the
cheering
had
abandoned
their
duties
and
like
the
rest
of
the
eager
crowd
were
intent
on
the
jumper
their
hearts
in
sympathy
leaping
with
him
and
while
the
crowd
watched
his
every
motion
melvin
himself
saw
nothing
but
the
bar
ahead
of
him
with
the
white
handkerchief
upon
it
and
the
height
and
the
distance
and
the
infinite
desirability
of
clearing
the
white
handkerchief
and
the
bar
without
moving
them
from
their
a
short
nervous
run
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
bar
a
crouch
like
that
of
the
panther
springing
for
its
prey
and
up
he
floated
and
over
the
white
square
as
if
five
feet
eight
were
an
easy
stint
and
his
legs
adjusted
themselves
automatically
to
the
bar
that
jump
settled
the
contests
for
mcgee
failed
three
times
and
was
out
and
the
score
remained
a
tie
seatonians
and
hillburyites
alike
sent
forth
victorious
yells
and
then
lapsing
into
silence
went
their
respective
ways
wondering
whether
they
were
really
victors
or
vanquished
and
only
such
as
had
prizes
in
their
hands
were
sure
that
the
day
had
not
gone
against
them
hi
dick
yelled
tompkins
from
the
end
of
the
corridor
as
melvin
came
upstairs
to
his
room
you
did
it
after
all
we
did
and
we
didn
t
answered
dick
lingering
in
his
doorway
perhaps
we
ought
to
be
satisfied
for
it
seems
to
me
that
the
hillbury
team
was
really
the
better
then
i
was
about
what
asked
dick
whose
mind
was
oblivious
to
all
the
happenings
of
the
day
except
those
of
the
last
few
hours
why
about
what
i
said
this
morning
hillbury
was
the
better
team
and
yet
you
didn
t
that
s
a
fact
said
dick
his
face
breaking
into
a
smile
the
next
time
don
t
call
a
man
crazy
just
because
he
comes
from
montana

tompkins
with

of

the

on
the
following
monday
moore
waited
on
the
principal
in
great
agitation
i
am
in
despair
about
little
eddy
said
he
it
seems
as
though
i
could
not
endure
that
miserable
white
vacant
face
in
my
room
another
day
he
has
done
no
work
worthy
of
the
name
in
a
fortnight
and
i
see
no
way
of
making
him
do
you
have
talked
with
him
about
it
i
suppose
suggested
graham
repeatedly
and
with
all
the
tact
i
possess
i
have
tried
to
win
his
confidence
by
kindness
i
have
expostulated
with
him
i
have
threatened
him
i
have
ridiculed
him
i
have
given
him
long
tasks
to
write
out
nothing
that
i
can
say
or
do
has
the
slightest
effect
on
the
little
mule
sometimes
i
think
he
is
actuated
by
a
feeling
of
personal
malice
toward
me
and
the
thought
makes
me
so
nervous
that
i
can
hardly
conduct
my
graham
smiled
you
have
no
ground
for
that
feeling
i
am
sure
for
similar
reports
have
come
to
me
from
other
he
paused
a
moment
and
his
expression
became
sombre
as
he
went
on
the
boy
has
evidently
something
very
serious
on
his
mind
i
will
talk
with
him
myself
do
you
know
whether
he
is
still
intimate
with
bosworth
you
have
a
high
opinion
of
bosworth
i
moore
hesitated
and
passing
over
the
question
replied
to
the
suggestion
i
used
to
have
since
i
caught
him
writing
composition
exercises
for
marks
i
do
not
feel
so
sure
about
him
still
he
does
his
work
for
me
in
a
way
that
i
can
not
complain
do
you
think
he
could
be
guilty
of
the
thieving
from
rooms
that
is
going
on
in
carter
and
hale
thieving
i
should
hope
not
do
you
suspect
him
i
do
and
i
don
t
replied
graham
wearily
he
spends
more
money
than
any
boy
ought
to
spend
who
is
receiving
help
from
the
school
on
two
occasions
at
least
when
money
was
taken
i
satisfied
myself
that
he
might
have
done
it
but
i
had
no
direct
evidence
against
him
not
even
enough
to
warrant
calling
him
up
and
questioning
him
about
it
meantime
the
thieving
still
goes
on
there
was
another
case
in
hale
on
moore
looked
solemn
what
a
scandal
it
ought
certainly
to
be
stopped
even
if
we
have
to
employ
detectives
could
you
not
introduce
a
detective
of
youthful
appearance
as
a
new
boy
the
principal
shook
his
head
new
boys
don
t
enter
school
on
the
first
of
june
besides
i
am
opposed
on
principle
to
such
methods
this
is
a
crime
by
a
boy
against
boys
the
boys
by
their
carelessness
and
negligence
are
partially
responsible
for
what
has
occurred
they
can
and
ought
to
ferret
out
the
offender
i
m
afraid
you
will
accomplish
little
if
you
rely
on
the
coöperation
of
boys
said
moore
as
he
rose
to
go
they
always
stand
by
one
another
and
cover
up
one
another
s
sins
at
any
rate
don
t
suspect
poor
bosworth
until
you
have
incontrovertible
proof
the
worst
thing
i
know
against
him
is
his
intimacy
with
that
little
wretch
the
interview
between
eddy
and
the
principal
was
very
unsatisfactory
early
in
the
course
of
it
the
boy
lapsed
into
tears
and
his
answers
were
interjected
between
sobs
that
shook
his
own
frail
body
and
wrung
the
master
s
heart
he
did
his
best
for
moore
he
was
not
well
and
had
not
been
for
weeks
no
he
hadn
t
anything
on
his
mind
he
shouldn
t
be
sorry
if
he
were
sent
home
he
didn
t
care
for
the
school
or
the
boys
in
it
except
one
bosworth
suggested
graham
gently
no
sir
replied
the
boy
emphatically
an
expression
of
repugnance
flitting
over
his
face
i
mean
phil
poole
he
s
the
only
one
who
has
ever
been
kind
to
with
this
leading
to
follow
the
principal
relaxed
the
sternness
of
his
method
and
pleaded
with
the
boy
to
open
his
heart
frankly
with
full
confidence
that
he
would
be
treated
kindly
and
fairly
more
tears
more
violent
sobs
more
convulsive
protestations
of
innocence
either
eddy
would
tell
nothing
or
he
had
nothing
to
tell
the
next
morning
in
chapel
graham
expressed
the
indignation
he
felt
that
sneak
thievery
in
the
dormitories
should
continue
and
reminded
the
boys
that
they
shared
with
him
the
responsibility
for
the
conduct
of
the
school
the
admonition
was
hardly
necessary
for
the
students
were
already
thoroughly
aroused
they
discussed
the
cases
from
every
side
and
uttered
vague
and
terrible
threats
as
to
what
would
be
done
with
the
malefactor
if
they
once
got
him
in
their
hands
the
discussion
yielded
no
result
except
to
bring
the
names
of
a
dozen
innocent
lads
into
temporary
disrepute
and
threats
as
varrell
disconsolately
remarked
to
melvin
are
of
no
use
when
addressed
to
no
one
in
particular
hillbury
day
came
for
the
last
fortnight
the
nine
had
been
playing
a
steady
game
which
if
not
brilliant
was
at
least
thoroughly
good
and
the
school
having
shaken
itself
clear
of
the
wavering
mood
in
which
hope
and
fear
seesaw
up
and
down
with
every
fresh
rumor
from
the
rival
diamond
had
settled
finally
into
a
cautiously
sanguine
frame
of
mind
there
were
still
some
who
spoke
with
disapproval
of
the
favoritism
which
displaced
a
veteran
and
put
a
young
boy
like
poole
into
an
important
field
but
among
this
small
number
the
generally
rampant
patriotism
proved
too
strong
for
personal
prejudice
even
marks
whose
baseball
lingo
would
have
discouraged
a
sporting
editor
and
who
asserted
that
the
kid
would
queer
the
gang
silly
slangy
sporting
marks
only
half
believed
what
he
said
and
was
really
quite
willing
that
the
fielder
should
distinguish
himself
if
this
was
necessary
to
the
success
of
the
team
the
crowd
poured
into
the
campus
that
afternoon
as
if
there
were
no
end
to
it
word
had
gone
forth
that
the
nine
had
a
show
to
win
and
the
younger
graduates
thronged
the
regular
trains
as
dick
clutching
proudly
his
cheerleader
s
baton
walked
along
the
line
of
seats
to
the
centre
section
where
the
cheering
force
was
clustered
he
caught
glimpses
of
familiar
faces
of
old
boys
smiling
down
at
him
from
among
the
rows
of
straw
hats
and
gay
parasols
he
recognized
varrell
perched
on
the
topmost
bench
and
shook
his
baton
at
him
in
a
vain
effort
to
attract
his
notice
but
varrell
s
attention
was
elsewhere
and
dick
got
no
return
for
his
demonstration
except
a
scowl
from
bosworth
who
occupied
a
seat
halfway
up
at
the
edge
of
the
entrance
passage
presently
the
nines
appeared
and
in
the
din
of
yells
and
the
confusion
of
waving
banners
dick
s
whole
attention
was
devoted
to
following
planter
s
leadership
and
keeping
his
own
side
of
the
section
in
proper
time
while
the
hillbury
nine
was
taking
its
practice
melvin
slipped
over
to
the
players
bench
for
a
last
word
with
tompkins
and
poole
and
was
delighted
to
find
them
both
cool
and
determined
how
i
m
feeling
bully
replied
tompkins
if
only
i
knew
how
to
pitch
i
could
do
wonders
give
us
your
best
that
s
good
enough
for
us
returned
the
senior
clapping
him
on
the
shoulder
i
m
going
to
put
up
my
best
bluff
anyway
answered
tommy
if
i
fail
it
won
t
be
because
i
don
t
don
t
let
em
rattle
you
urged
melvin
you
needn
t
worry
about
that
put
in
phil
this
pitcher
doesn
t
just
then
the
umpire
called
the
game
and
melvin
hurried
back
to
his
charge
hillbury
took
the
field
millan
after
leisurely
rubbing
the
new
ball
in
the
grass
beside
the
pitcher
s
box
while
his
friends
were
roaring
encouraging
cheers
put
in
a
hot
one
over
the
corner
of
the
plate
one
strike
the
next
was
a
ball
the
third
vincent
struck
at
and
raised
a
high
foul
gathered
in
by
the
first
baseman
robinson
hit
at
the
first
ball
pitched
and
dropped
an
easy
fly
in
the
s
reach
watson
went
out
ignominiously
on
strikes
and
the
hillbury
team
came
trotting
smilingly
in
quite
satisfied
that
they
deserved
the
three
long
ringing
hillburys
thrown
at
them
by
a
grateful
constituency
the
red
letters
scattered
to
their
places
stevens
who
headed
the
hillbury
list
went
to
bat
with
an
appearance
of
confidence
and
power
but
his
bold
air
belied
his
real
feelings
nervous
and
uncertain
he
let
the
first
ball
pass
and
heard
it
called
a
strike
struck
foolishly
at
the
second
which
was
out
of
his
reach
and
then
after
a
ball
had
been
called
hit
a
slow
bounder
to
the
pitcher
hood
who
followed
did
not
touch
the
ball
though
he
struck
hard
at
it
thrice
and
franklin
dropped
a
weak
fly
into
robinson
s
hands
seaton
came
in
for
their
second
inning
after
a
short
five
minutes
in
the
field
poole
up
phil
picked
out
his
favorite
bat
fixed
his
feet
firmly
on
the
ground
and
boldly
facing
the
pitcher
tried
to
forget
that
this
was
the
hillbury
game
and
to
see
in
the
man
before
him
not
the
redoubtable
millan
but
a
practice
pitcher
whose
balls
were
easy
if
closely
watched
the
first
was
wide
the
second
too
low
the
third
he
caught
squarely
and
drove
it
over
the
uncovered
second
base
into
the
it
was
the
first
hit
of
the
game
and
the
seatonians
noised
their
joy
abroad
in
a
splendid
and
now
in
addition
to
the
senseless
exhortations
of
the
fielders
right
at
em
now
right
in
the
middle
of
the
big
mitt
put
it
over
old
boy
were
heard
the
yells
of
the
coacher
whose
object
usually
seems
to
be
to
confuse
the
pitcher
rather
than
to
help
the
phil
clung
to
first
while
sudbury
struck
twice
and
then
went
out
on
a
long
fly
and
sands
hit
a
pop
foul
that
the
third
baseman
easily
caught
with
two
men
out
phil
started
on
the
first
pitch
to
steal
second
that
he
was
successful
was
due
as
much
to
the
catcher
s
high
throw
as
to
his
own
speed
for
the
second
baseman
had
to
jump
for
the
ball
and
while
he
was
in
the
air
phil
slid
safely
in
to
the
base
a
good
single
now
would
bring
in
the
run
and
the
seatonians
with
a
silent
eagerness
that
the
did
not
try
to
interrupt
waited
to
see
if
waddington
would
meet
their
hopes
one
strike
one
ball
two
balls
two
strikes
and
waddington
cracked
out
a
pretty
liner
over
third
that
brought
poole
home
and
put
the
batsman
on
second
hayes
went
out
on
a
grounder
to
hillbury
came
in
determined
to
hit
the
ball
ribot
drove
a
hard
bounder
to
third
where
watson
trapped
the
ball
on
the
ground
and
fielded
cleanly
to
first
kleindienst
went
out
on
strikes
and
haley
after
three
balls
had
been
called
hit
a
long
fly
to
that
looked
to
be
a
hit
phil
was
off
with
the
hit
racing
for
the
spot
where
the
ball
was
to
fall
and
sure
after
his
first
glance
over
his
shoulder
that
he
would
be
able
to
reach
it
but
the
crowd
was
not
so
sure
and
when
at
the
end
of
his
run
he
suddenly
turned
and
pulled
the
ball
down
a
howl
of
applause
rose
from
the
seaton
benches
that
for
the
moment
made
the
seem
quite
useless
ornaments
as
dick
stood
waiting
for
this
outburst
to
pass
he
glanced
curiously
along
the
tiers
of
eager
faces
and
suddenly
became
conscious
that
one
spectator
seemed
to
have
no
share
in
the
general
delight
untouched
by
the
excitement
raging
about
him
bosworth
sat
darkly
glowering
out
over
the
diamond
a
melancholy
island
in
a
heaving
sea
of
joy
illustration
he
suddenly
turned
and
pulled
the
ball
the
third
inning
passed
without
changing
the
score
in
the
fourth
watson
and
poole
went
out
on
hits
and
sudbury
was
left
at
second
when
sands
struck
out
hillbury
began
well
when
hood
got
his
base
on
balls
if
franklin
disappointed
his
friends
by
sending
a
fly
to
ribot
made
up
for
the
failure
by
driving
the
second
ball
pitched
in
a
straight
line
over
the
first
baseman
s
head
by
the
time
vincent
got
it
back
hood
had
crossed
the
plate
and
ribot
stood
exulting
on
third
base
the
hillburyites
were
on
their
feet
oblivious
of
and
programme
howling
their
pride
and
hope
the
score
was
tied
a
hit
an
error
a
long
fly
would
let
ribot
in
and
put
hillbury
in
the
lead
tompkins
was
watching
ribot
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
but
his
whole
mind
was
concentrated
on
the
problem
of
putting
the
ball
just
where
it
was
required
unworried
but
more
deliberate
than
ever
he
responded
to
sands
s
signals
one
strike
one
ball
a
foul
two
balls
two
strikes
the
eager
seatonians
began
to
breathe
more
easily
a
strike
out
would
improve
the
situation
vastly
sands
signaled
for
a
slow
high
ball
over
the
inside
corner
tompkins
shook
his
head
but
sands
repeated
the
signal
and
the
pitcher
obeyed
the
ball
came
true
but
kleindienst
fearing
a
called
strike
waited
until
it
was
near
him
and
then
slashed
recklessly
at
it
almost
simultaneously
phil
heard
the
crack
of
the
bat
saw
the
ball
rising
high
above
the
second
baseman
s
head
and
felt
his
heart
sink
with
a
sudden
stab
of
pain
the
fly
was
so
far
out
that
even
if
sudbury
caught
it
it
would
be
next
to
impossible
for
him
to
return
the
ball
in
time
to
hold
the
runner
on
third
and
so
it
proved
sudbury
got
the
fly
after
a
hard
run
turned
quickly
and
sent
it
hot
to
the
second
baseman
who
lined
it
home
but
ribot
was
across
the
plate
by
ten
feet
when
the
ball
came
to
rest
in
sands
s
grasp
wildly
as
the
hillburyites
yelled
seaton
matched
them
cheer
for
cheer
shouting
to
keep
their
courage
up
and
show
the
nine
men
in
the
field
that
their
schoolfellows
were
not
despondent
haley
struck
twice
then
lifted
the
ball
over
hayes
s
head
into
short
phil
had
a
sharp
run
to
get
under
the
ball
but
he
took
it
safely
enough
and
then
though
the
three
men
were
out
he
set
himself
for
a
throw
and
sent
it
in
to
the
home
plate
sands
had
to
go
forward
a
step
to
meet
it
a
little
longer
next
time
thought
phil
as
he
trotted
in
i
can
do
it
if
seaton
s
half
of
the
fifth
inning
was
soon
over
waddington
went
out
on
a
high
foul
hayes
on
a
fly
to
and
tommy
very
tamely
on
strikes
when
webster
stepped
up
to
the
plate
to
lead
off
for
hillbury
more
than
one
timid
seatonian
felt
a
mysterious
foreboding
that
this
was
to
prove
a
fatal
inning
webster
thought
so
too
for
he
waited
bravely
until
two
balls
had
been
called
and
then
drove
a
beautiful
liner
over
the
second
baseman
s
head
that
only
a
brilliant
stop
by
vincent
prevented
from
being
a
hit
webster
rested
at
first
the
hillburyites
brandished
their
arms
and
whooped
while
the
seaton
spat
on
their
gloves
and
braced
themselves
for
great
deeds
encouraging
tommy
meantime
to
be
right
there
with
the
goods
and
put
em
straight
over
old
man
whether
tompkins
profited
by
these
admonitions
it
would
be
hard
to
say
he
certainly
did
his
prettiest
to
deliver
the
goods
conscious
that
every
pitch
was
a
critical
one
one
strike
three
balls
cunningham
waited
hoping
for
a
chance
to
two
strikes
the
batsman
gathered
himself
for
his
last
chance
and
smote
hard
at
the
ball
but
succeeded
only
in
sending
a
grounder
to
the
pitcher
tompkins
turned
and
threw
deliberately
to
second
base
where
webster
was
forced
out
though
robinson
was
not
quick
enough
to
catch
the
man
at
first
still
one
man
was
out
and
the
spectators
were
encouraged
millan
came
to
bat
glaring
defiance
at
the
seaton
pitcher
the
first
one
looked
promising
and
he
swung
hard
at
it
the
seatonians
heard
the
crack
had
a
momentary
impression
of
the
ball
going
like
a
toward
first
base
saw
waddington
put
his
hands
together
stagger
and
dart
for
first
after
an
instant
understood
that
the
fifth
inning
had
ended
suddenly
with
a
double
play
as
dick
turned
round
to
do
his
part
in
leading
the
cheers
for
waddy
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
bosworth
climbing
down
from
his
place
into
the
passage
that
led
to
the
rear
of
the
seats
in
the
excitement
of
the
scene
melvin
would
hardly
have
noticed
this
departure
of
a
single
member
of
the
disorderly
crowd
had
not
the
last
look
that
the
fellow
cast
along
the
benches
had
in
it
an
element
of
fear
and
stealth
that
drew
his
attention
as
the
glint
of
distant
water
reflecting
the
sunlight
catches
the
eye
of
the
mountaineer
an
absorbing
suspicion
which
made
even
the
game
seem
of
secondary
interest
suddenly
possessed
his
mind
hastily
turning
over
his
baton
to
one
of
his
with
an
explanation
that
did
not
explain
melvin
pushed
his
way
to
the
rear
of
the
crowd
that
thronged
the
entrance
passage
through
which
bosworth
had
just
gone
there
was
his
man
thirty
yards
away
walking
toward
the
entrance
to
the
grounds
the
senior
halted
turned
back
into
the
enclosure
and
ran
his
eye
along
the
benches
to
varrell
s
seat
he
s
gone
he
muttered
in
dismay
just
my
cursed
luck
and
i
can
t
stop
to
hunt
him
up
he
waited
a
moment
longer
sweeping
the
tiers
of
seats
with
his
eye
in
vain
search
for
his
missing
friend
then
he
turned
back
again
into
the
passage
and
watched
bosworth
out
of
the
grounds
at
the
gate
bosworth
stopped
and
exchanged
a
few
words
with
the
man
on
duty
they
are
asking
him
about
the
score
thought
dick
i
wonder
how
he
explains
his
sudden
as
bosworth
passed
out
of
sight
down
the
street
dick
set
off
on
a
run
for
the
gate
was
that
bosworth
mike
he
panted
as
he
hailed
the
gatekeeper
i
dunno
the
feller
at
all
i
just
axed
him
how
the
game
was
goin
and
he
said

all
asked
dick
disappointed
no

i
axed
him

he
said

fift
and
i
said
how
cud

lave
a
close
game
like
that
right
in
the
middle
av
it
and
he
said
the
sthrain
was
too
much
for
his
nerves
but
they
s
a
chance
for
the
byes
yit
ain
t
they
i
think
so
replied
dick
absently
he
was
contrasting
the
utter
indifference
stamped
on
bosworth
s
face
as
he
sat
among
the
enthusiasts
with
this
tale
of
nervous
agitation
whose
wheel
is
that
he
demanded
abruptly
pointing
to
a
bicycle
leaning
against
the
fence
mine
said
mike

important

said
mike
the
word
was
hardly
out
of
his
mouth
before
melvin
had
seized
the
bicycle
and
was
running
it
across
the
street
mike
and
his
comrade
watched
the
student
whip
the
machine
through
the
yard
opposite
over
a
wire
fence
and
across
another
lawn
to
a
second
street
where
he
mounted
and
sprinted
off

a

to

on
the
third
floor
of
hale
by
following
lincoln
street
and
the
path
through
the
seminary
yard
dick
covered
two
sides
of
a
triangle
much
more
quickly
than
the
pedestrian
could
the
third
side
the
direct
road
from
campus
to
academy
he
leaned
the
bicycle
against
the
gymnasium
wall
out
of
sight
and
crept
into
the
shelter
of
the
high
steps
of
carter
whence
he
could
command
a
view
of
the
dormitories
without
being
seen
himself
never
had
the
old
academy
yard
worn
such
an
air
of
silence
and
desertion
old
robeson
was
raking
the
driveway
on
the
other
side
of
the
gymnasium
the
saturday
cleaners
were
buried
in
the
depths
of
the
recitation
building
except
for
the
indescribable
roar
of
distant
cheering
which
came
in
bursts
from
the
direction
of
the
campus
or
the
noise
of
an
occasional
wagon
rattling
along
the
street
the
yard
might
have
been
some
silent
meadow
afar
from
the
haunts
of
men
every
dormitory
window
open
thought
dick
as
he
glanced
around
the
yard
and
half
the
doors
too
i
ll
bet
those
fellows
really
deserve
to
lose
some
of
their
things
but
what
a
cinch
for
a
thief
some
minutes
passed
before
bosworth
appeared
on
the
street
and
turned
leisurely
into
the
yard
when
he
reached
the
point
where
the
path
divided
he
hesitated
an
instant
before
turning
away
from
his
own
dormitory
toward
the
middle
entry
of
hale
at
the
hale
steps
he
stopped
again
threw
a
hurried
glance
over
the
yard
and
disappeared
into
the
dormitory
entry
a
moment
later
dick
was
scuttling
along
the
driveway
toward
the
corner
of
hale
hardly
had
he
gained
the
shelter
of
the
dormitory
wall
and
begun
to
creep
along
beneath
the
windows
toward
the
middle
entry
when
a
sudden
apparition
at
the
farther
corner
drew
from
his
lips
an
exclamation
of
wonder
which
would
certainly
have
betrayed
him
if
bosworth
had
been
near
enough
to
hear
it
there
was
varrell
quietly
working
his
way
along
the
wall
from
the
other
direction
his
face
flushed
red
as
if
from
a
long
hard
run
but
showing
not
the
slightest
surprise
at
this
meeting
with
his
confederate
they
came
together
at
the
entrance
where
varrell
checking
with
an
unmistakable
gesture
melvin
s
obvious
intention
to
ask
questions
crept
stealthily
in
and
crouched
against
the
wall
under
the
stairs
his
friend
followed
close
after
shoes
off
whispered
varrell
with
lips
close
to
dick
s
ear
the
order
was
obeyed
without
question
varrell
placed
his
straw
hat
beside
his
shoes
dick
imitated
him
can
you
hear
him
came
in
a
second
whisper
dick
listened
at
first
absolute
silence
then
the
sound
from
the
second
floor
of
a
door
being
carefully
shut
followed
by
the
scrape
of
a
sole
upon
the
marble
staircase
above
then
the
click
of
a
and
silence
again
he
s
just
left
a
room
in
the
second
story
and
gone
up
to
one
in
the
third
whispered
dick
now
is
our
time
announced
varrell
and
led
the
way
up
their
steps
were
noiseless
on
the
solid
stone
the
doors
to
both
suites
on
the
third
floor
were
closed
which
whispered
varrell
never
had
he
envied
his
classmate
s
quick
hearing
as
at
this
very
instant
dick
applied
his
ear
to
the
door
on
the
right
he
could
dimly
hear
the
distant
cheering
a
formless
threatening
sound
drifting
in
through
the
open
windows
of
the
room
like
the
roar
of
an
angry
mob
within
the
room
all
was
silent
he
shook
his
head
and
tiptoed
to
the
other
door
here
too
his
ear
at
first
detected
no
sound
that
did
not
come
from
without
but
presently
he
heard
footsteps
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
and
a
grating
noise
as
from
the
opening
of
a
drawer
he
s
here
said
melvin
s
lips
his
nod
and
gesture
would
have
told
the
story
to
a
fool
varrell
motioned
him
aside
and
gently
turned
the
knob
the
door
moved
slightly
on
its
hinges
ready
queried
varrell
s
eyes
dick
nodded
and
varrell
threw
wide
the
door
there
stood
the
long
pursued
before
the
open
drawer
of
a
dressing
table
with
a
pair
of
gold
in
his
hand
bosworth
gave
a
start
and
wheeled
round
upon
the
intruders
he
uttered
no
sound
but
his
eyes
took
on
a
wild
frightened
look
while
his
sallow
face
faded
to
a
paler
shade
and
the
red
line
of
his
lips
became
a
whitish
blue
as
he
faced
the
fierce
looks
of
his
two
pursuers
so
we
ve
caught
the
thief
at
last
said
varrell
sternly
this
time
in
the
very
bosworth
moistened
his
lips
if
you
think
i
m
a
thief
you
re
greatly
mistaken
he
began
rolling
his
eyes
from
side
to
side
like
a
person
searching
for
ideas
under
a
great
strain
we
don
t
think
we
know
answered
varrell
there
s
stolen
property
right
in
your
for
a
moment
bosworth
hesitated
looking
down
when
he
lifted
his
eyes
again
he
was
ready
with
an
explanation
i
was
just
looking
at
them
i
came
in
here
to
get
a
trot
i
lent
to
morton
i
couldn
t
stand
the
strain
of
the
game
so
i
decided
to
come
back
and
work
i
thought
probably
the
door
would
be
unlocked
and
i
could
get
the
book
for
myself
i
opened
the
drawer
to
see
if
the
book
was
there
isn
t
the
kind
of
thing
a
fellow
would
show
on
his
study
table
buttons
caught
my
eye
and
i
took
them
up
out
of
huh
snorted
varrell
and
what
about
that
on
the
table
i
know
nothing
about
any
replied
bosworth
with
a
show
of
resentment
if
there
s
a
on
the
table
i
suppose
morton
left
it
there
the
fact
that
it
s
there
shows
i
m
not
a
thief
i
should
have
taken
it
if
i
had
dick
s
conviction
began
to
weaken
it
all
sounded
very
natural
and
plausible
had
wrenn
s
infatuation
put
them
both
into
a
false
position
he
turned
to
bosworth
if
what
you
say
is
true
we
have
done
you
a
great
injustice
you
say
you
came
here
for
the
book
did
you
come
directly
here
without
going
to
any
other
room
of
course
not
replied
bosworth
impatiently
didn
t
i
say
i
wanted
the
trot
a
glance
of
intelligence
flashed
from
dick
s
face
to
varrell
s
he
s
lying
said
varrell
coolly
we
ll
have
to
wait
till
more
fellows
come
when
we
ll
search
him
and
search
his
a
look
of
apprehension
appeared
on
bosworth
s
face
you
have
no
right
to
search
me
he
cried
i
won
t
stand
we
ll
see
was
varrell
s
laconic
answer
a
leisurely
step
now
made
itself
heard
on
the
stairs
below
and
soon
the
surprised
face
of
little
eddy
appeared
on
the
landing
outside
how
s
the
game
going
cried
dick
suddenly
bethinking
himself
that
the
great
contest
was
still
on
i
don
t
know
answered
the
boy
in
sullen
tones
peering
curiously
into
the
room
i
haven
t
been
to
the
game
i
ve
been
up
the
what
are
you
doing
here
i
m
going
up
to
my
well
go
on
then
commanded
varrell
eddy
started
on
eddy
called
bosworth
with
a
hasty
movement
quite
unlike
the
indolent
slouch
with
which
he
had
crawled
upstairs
eddy
hurried
back
and
stood
in
the
doorway
expectant
his
big
eyes
full
of
fear
his
whole
expression
that
of
a
dog
cringing
before
a
cruel
master
the
sight
stirred
dick
to
the
depths
of
his
heart
if
ever
he
had
felt
a
doubt
as
to
varrell
s
course
or
a
lurking
suspicion
born
of
his
sense
of
fair
play
that
bosworth
might
after
all
be
a
comparatively
innocent
victim
of
appearances
the
doubt
and
suspicion
vanished
in
the
presence
of
that
abject
figure
like
raindrops
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
i
d
like
to
speak
to
him
a
moment
said
bosworth
nervously
no
you
don
t
cried
dick
you
ve
had
your
last
speech
with
oh
let
them
talk
said
varrell
giving
his
friend
a
sharp
look
only
nothing
must
pass
between
you
he
added
turning
again
to
bosworth
if
you
are
willing
to
back
up
against
the
wall
there
and
have
the
boy
stand
at
one
side
so
that
there
s
a
clear
open
space
between
you
and
both
face
this
way
we
ll
go
out
in
the
entry
out
of
hearing
and
watch
you
through
the
door
from
a
distance
otherwise
there
had
better
be
no
conversation
until
after
the
search
is
bosworth
agreed
to
the
terms
varrell
stationed
the
two
as
he
wanted
them
in
the
best
light
with
dick
withdrew
to
the
entry
where
varrell
planted
himself
and
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
faces
of
the
whispering
pair
in
a
long
intense
stare
dick
understood
well
the
game
his
friend
was
playing
and
his
own
eyes
wandered
helplessly
from
the
observer
to
the
observed
trying
to
guess
from
wrenn
s
expression
his
success
in
reading
bosworth
s
lips
fearful
of
failure
as
the
thief
gradually
bent
his
head
in
eddy
s
direction
face
this
way
cried
varrell
we
re
through
now
replied
bosworth
eddy
go
up
and
stand
on
the
stairs
in
sight
till
we
call
you
down
ordered
varrell
then
in
a
low
tone
to
dick
he
added
keep
him
there
a
jiffy
till
i
can
put
on
my
shoes
and
get
ahead
of
him
to
bosworth
s
room
hang
to
bosworth
like
grim
death
don
t
let
the
fellow
get
you
can
trust
him
to
me
answered
dick
eagerly
what
luck
i
can
t
tell
yet
returned
wrenn
two
minutes
later
eddy
was
allowed
to
go
and
sauntered
leisurely
down
the
first
flight
of
stairs
the
second
he
took
more
rapidly
at
the
dormitory
entrance
he
broke
into
a
run
which
he
maintained
up
the
stairs
to
bosworth
s
threshold
the
door
was
unlocked
had
no
fear
of
thieves
inside
sat
varrell
shut
the
door
can
t
you
was
the
senior
s
sharp
greeting
to
the
amazed
lad
now
what
did
you
come
here
for
out
with
it
and
don
t
try
to
lie
for
i
shall
catch
you
if
you
eddy
gaped
helplessly
around
he
stammered
between
gasps
don
t
lie
to
me
said
varrell
sternly
what
did
he
tell
you
to
get
in
the
closet
varrell
jerked
open
the
closet
door
ran
his
hand
over
the
clothing
hung
on
the
hooks
gave
the
shoes
on
the
floor
a
kick
and
pulled
down
an
empty
pasteboard
box
from
the
shelf
then
he
turned
to
eddy
look
here
boy
he
said
in
a
gentler
tone
bosworth
is
a
thief
and
a
rascal
as
you
are
perfectly
well
aware
you
d
better
tell
what
you
know
and
save
your
own
skin
while
you
i
haven
t
anything
to
eddy
s
lips
were
trembling
and
his
eyes
promised
tears
but
his
face
still
wore
the
expression
of
stubborn
determination
the
little
fool
groaned
varrell
turning
away
he
s
too
thoroughly
terrorized
to
let
anything
out
and
to
think
that
we
are
so
near
the
goal
and
can
t
quite
reach
it
if
only
the
villain
had
not
moved
his
head
when
he
did
yellow
book
i
could
have
sworn
he
said
yellow
book
in
the
closet
but
there
s
no
yellow
book
in
the
closet
or
anywhere
else
he
opened
the
closet
door
once
more
and
stumbled
over
one
of
the
shoes
he
had
contemptuously
kicked
a
minute
before
in
a
burst
of
irritation
he
stooped
to
pick
up
the
shoe
and
throw
it
where
it
would
trouble
him
no
more
as
he
lifted
it
into
plainer
view
its
color
caught
his
eye
and
his
arm
paused
in
what
a
blunderer
he
ejaculated
it
was
boot
not
book
how
could
i
have
made
such
an
error
eddy
stood
mute
staring
with
anxious
fascinated
face
as
the
senior
ran
his
hand
into
the
shoe
turned
it
over
shook
it
and
threw
it
down
he
stooped
for
the
other
inverted
it
and
tapped
it
upon
the
floor
then
rose
and
felt
carefully
inside
while
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
trembling
boy
there
seems
to
be
paper
here
he
said
slowly
or
at
any
rate
something
like
it
that
is
fitted
close
to
the
lining
of
the
the
next
moment
he
had
dropped
the
shoe
and
was
unfolding
a
small
square
piece
of
paper
it
was
the
check
stolen
from
the
office
safe
on
the
night
of
march
seventh
varrell
s
first
impulse
was
to
let
out
a
yell
of
triumph
that
would
make
the
whole
dormitory
entry
ring
his
second
to
make
sure
that
his
triumph
was
real
there
was
no
question
of
the
identity
of
the
check
he
had
heard
too
much
about
the
details
of
the
case
to
have
any
doubt
on
that
score
but
would
not
a
skilled
liar
like
bosworth
be
able
to
squirm
out
of
even
a
predicament
like
this
the
senior
turned
again
to
eddy
who
was
now
leaning
upon
the
table
his
head
buried
in
his
arms
weeping
in
great
despairing
sobs
i
see
how
it
is
said
varrell
sternly
you
learned
the
combination
and
induced
bosworth
to
steal
the
money
he
divided
it
with
you
and
when
this
was
spent
you
stole
from
the
it
isn
t
so
sobbed
the
boy
i
never
stole
a
cent
in
my
life
bosworth
did
it
all
i
told
him
of
the
combination
that
s
all
i
had
to
do
with
it
i
didn
t
know
he
stole
it
till
long
after
when
he
told
me
that
the
money
he
d
lent
me
had
come
from
the
safe
and
i
d
be
arrested
too
if
he
was
caught
but
i
never
stole
a
thing
in
my
whole
i
ve
paid
him
almost
up
too
oh
i
m
so
unhappy
what
will
my
mother
do
if
i
have
to
go
to
jail
varrell
laid
his
hand
gently
on
the
lad
s
quivering
shoulder
the
inquisitor
s
heart
was
touched
you
won
t
go
to
jail
at
all
if
you
brace
up
and
make
a
clean
breast
of
the
whole
thing
said
the
senior
you
haven
t
done
anything
wrong
except
to
cover
up
another
s
he
waited
quietly
for
the
sobs
to
slacken
with
his
hand
still
on
eddy
s
shoulder
and
while
he
waited
there
smote
upon
his
ear
from
the
direction
of
the
campus
another
roar
tumultuous
and
long
drawn
out
that
rose
and
subsided
and
rose
again
like
the
howl
of
the
northwest
wind
on
a
winter
night
their
game
is
over
too
mused
varrell
i
wonder
if
they
have
had
our
chapter
xxvi
a
double
assist
and
now
for
the
finish
of
the
game
when
dick
and
varrell
made
their
hurried
exit
from
the
field
the
sixth
inning
was
just
under
way
each
team
beginning
over
again
at
the
head
of
its
batting
list
the
cheering
that
dick
had
heard
while
he
was
waiting
at
the
steps
of
carter
was
provoked
by
the
successful
retirement
of
the
first
three
hillbury
batters
the
three
men
who
headed
the
seaton
list
had
already
gone
out
in
order
with
a
balance
of
one
in
the
score
in
favor
of
hillbury
and
hits
few
and
far
between
the
visitors
confidence
was
growing
every
additional
zero
in
the
seaton
score
now
meant
another
nail
in
the
seaton
coffin
the
seventh
began
with
poole
at
the
bat
the
first
ball
was
a
little
wide
for
him
but
he
thought
he
could
utilize
it
and
chopped
a
little
liner
over
the
s
head
when
sudbury
came
up
ribot
had
his
pitcher
throw
two
balls
in
the
hope
of
tempting
phil
to
try
to
steal
second
then
came
a
strike
and
another
ball
with
three
balls
called
phil
started
on
the
next
pitch
with
the
pitcher
s
arm
on
the
old
chance
of
hit
and
run
sudbury
bunted
and
got
his
base
on
ribot
s
wild
throw
to
first
while
phil
made
second
easily
this
was
a
beginning
that
stirred
anew
the
sluggish
seaton
throats
sands
came
up
to
the
plate
did
ever
captain
face
such
an
opportunity
a
single
would
tie
the
score
a
hit
would
probably
win
the
game
a
grounder
in
the
wrong
place
might
result
in
a
double
play
and
the
loss
of
the
start
this
made
sands
did
his
best
but
his
best
was
only
a
slow
grounder
toward
third
and
he
sped
away
to
first
without
much
hope
of
reaching
there
phil
had
taken
a
good
lead
from
second
and
dashed
past
kleindienst
the
hillbury
third
baseman
just
before
the
latter
got
the
ball
and
shot
it
across
the
diamond
to
first
sands
was
out
but
both
phil
and
sudbury
had
advanced
a
base
can
he
do
it
said
tompkins
as
waddington
faced
the
pitcher
do
what
asked
hayes
who
was
stamping
the
ground
with
his
foot
and
nervously
swinging
the
bat
in
his
hand
anything
but
strike
out
or
hit
to
the
replied
tompkins
if
he
makes
a
hit
we
win
the
game
he
doesn
t
we
lose
we
shan
t
get
another
chance
like
waddington
waited
until
two
strikes
and
three
balls
had
been
called
at
the
next
one
he
let
drive
with
all
his
power
it
s
a
homer
it
s
a
homer
shouted
tompkins
jumping
up
and
down
in
glee
no
a
corrected
hayes
wildly
flourishing
his
bat
dangerously
near
tompkins
s
head
but
it
was
neither
far
out
in
the
tennis
courts
that
bounded
franklin
threw
himself
at
the
flying
ball
and
clung
tight
to
it
though
he
fell
his
length
on
the
ground
he
recovered
himself
and
got
the
ball
back
in
season
to
hold
sudbury
at
third
but
phil
had
crossed
the
plate
there
was
babel
now
on
both
sides
of
the
diamond
seaton
cheering
the
run
that
tied
the
score
hillbury
the
brilliant
achievement
of
their
fielder
hayes
was
next
in
order
just
a
little
hit
haysey
pleaded
tompkins
over
second
will
do
make
a
hit
and
i
hayes
s
response
was
to
whack
the
ball
over
third
baseman
s
head
for
two
bases
sudbury
came
in
with
the
third
run
and
tompkins
went
out
ingloriously
by
batting
an
easy
ball
to
the
pitcher
the
seaton
half
of
the
inning
was
over
with
the
score
now
three
to
two
in
her
favor
hillbury
got
no
farther
than
third
in
her
half
in
the
eighth
the
batsmen
on
both
sides
went
down
like
pins
before
a
bowling
ball
the
pitchers
were
on
their
mettle
every
player
was
alert
and
keen
chance
itself
seemed
to
bring
the
hits
into
the
fielders
hands
cunningham
sprinted
twenty
feet
to
take
robinson
s
liner
watson
gathered
in
a
foul
right
in
the
midst
of
the
hillbury
benches
hayes
made
a
stop
of
what
promised
to
be
a
hit
the
no
longer
wasted
breath
in
exhortations
the
no
longer
tried
to
lead
the
crowd
was
left
to
follow
its
own
excited
inclination
and
incoherent
yells
took
the
place
of
cheers
and
songs
the
ninth
began
under
the
same
spell
of
fast
play
poole
went
out
on
a
fly
to
first
base
sudbury
struck
out
sands
hit
to
second
base
and
hillbury
came
in
for
her
last
chance
ribot
sent
a
fly
well
over
in
short
but
watson
ran
back
and
caught
it
kleindienst
hit
over
the
second
baseman
s
head
haley
dropped
a
fly
in
short
and
took
second
while
vincent
was
trying
to
catch
the
runner
at
third
with
only
one
man
out
and
runners
at
second
and
third
the
hillbury
cause
looked
bright
the
blue
banners
waved
wildly
but
the
hillbury
leaders
brought
back
their
companies
once
more
to
the
old
cheers
and
gave
webster
a
ringing
volley
as
he
stepped
up
to
the
plate
bat
in
hand
into
every
heart
over
the
whole
field
among
players
and
audience
alike
crept
the
conviction
that
the
two
runs
necessary
to
give
the
victory
to
hillbury
were
coming
in
and
that
webster
s
hit
was
to
bring
them
phil
drew
in
nearer
the
diamond
he
knew
webster
s
batting
record
like
a
book
he
had
kept
so
long
if
webster
made
a
hit
at
all
it
would
be
in
short
out
of
reach
of
both
third
and
crack
went
the
bat
the
hillburyites
rose
and
sent
forth
their
shout
of
victory
as
the
ball
sailed
safely
over
the
third
baseman
s
head
haley
started
immediately
from
second
kleindienst
on
third
waited
a
little
longer
to
make
sure
that
watson
would
not
repeat
his
previous
play
when
he
too
saw
that
the
ball
was
out
of
watson
s
reach
he
threw
care
to
the
winds
and
started
home
with
haley
rounding
the
base
only
a
dozen
feet
behind
him
beyond
third
neither
coachers
nor
runners
thought
to
look
sands
himself
who
had
thrown
his
mask
aside
and
now
stood
helpless
at
the
plate
steeling
himself
to
bear
the
sight
of
those
two
winning
runs
which
were
to
transform
a
game
almost
won
into
a
game
certainly
lost
himself
had
abandoned
hope
and
was
watching
the
flight
of
the
ball
with
indifference
stunned
with
the
bitterness
and
humiliation
of
defeat
then
as
he
gazed
an
abrupt
change
came
over
him
his
whole
figure
grew
radiant
as
with
a
mighty
and
unexpected
joy
the
hit
was
over
the
third
baseman
s
head
it
was
true
but
the
well
within
his
usual
position
had
run
rapidly
forward
to
meet
the
ball
taken
it
on
the
bounce
steadied
himself
for
a
throw
and
with
that
splendid
shoulder
drive
which
sands
had
so
often
envied
sent
it
straight
to
the
waiting
catcher
it
came
whizzing
past
the
shoulder
of
the
unsuspecting
kleindienst
and
landed
safely
in
sands
s
mitt
leisurely
as
if
there
were
no
chance
of
error
easily
as
if
such
plays
were
a
matter
of
everyday
practice
with
a
smile
on
his
lips
at
the
folly
of
those
who
feared
for
him
and
his
team
seaton
captain
stooped
and
tagged
the
first
runner
as
he
slid
in
then
stepped
forward
to
meet
the
second
plunging
at
the
heels
of
the
first
the
two
astonished
men
were
out
on
the
throw
to
the
plate

into

to

on

like

darting
over

when
at

he

so
unaccountably

at

by

they
drove
down
hilarious

giving

a

on

i
never
expect
to
feel
again
quite
such
a
shock
of
happiness
as
i
had
when
i
saw
the
ball
light
in
your
claws
and
start
home
again
with
that
old
gravity
when
i
felt
it
in
my
hands
i
could
have
whooped

to
see
that
poor
kleindienst
come
sliding
in
so
sweetly
with
the
ball
there
ahead

haley
at

rushing

at

phillie
asked

you

there
cried

did
you
ever

before
there
s

varrell

that
queer
little

dick
melvin
and
bosworth
behind

must
have
happened
to

those
fellows
at
the
sound
of
the
cheering
dick
wheeled
quickly
and
waved
his
hand
to
the
victors
in
the
barge
then
turned
again
to
his
charge
bosworth
did
not
raise
his
eyes
from
the
ground
tompkins
gave
phil
a
questioning
look
and
phil
answered
with
a
smile
and
a
nod
he
guessed
now
why
his

had
failed

conclusion
dick
sat
with
his
sullen
prisoner
in
the
principal
s
outer
office
while
varrell
and
eddy
were
closeted
with
graham
in
the
smaller
room
adjoining
the
door
between
was
left
ajar
and
both
prisoner
and
guard
strained
their
ears
for
some
inkling
of
the
course
of
events
in
the
inner
room
although
delighted
that
the
end
of
the
long
chase
had
been
reached
dick
was
not
altogether
satisfied
with
his
own
position
at
the
finish
he
had
submissively
stood
watch
while
varrell
had
made
the
search
in
bosworth
s
room
he
had
obeyed
as
submissively
when
varrell
had
reappeared
and
ordered
him
on
with
bosworth
to
the
principal
s
house
that
he
must
still
be
kept
on
guard
just
out
of
hearing
of
the
interesting
details
which
he
had
a
right
to
know
was
exasperating
even
if
unavoidable
with
the
feeling
that
he
was
doing
his
duty
dick
steeled
himself
to
wait
in
patience
through
the
crack
of
the
door
came
the
murmur
of
varrell
s
voice
as
in
low
steady
tones
he
told
his
story
occasionally
interrupted
by
short
distinct
questions
from
the
principal
that
dick
could
all
but
understand
presently
eddy
s
testimony
was
invoked
with
tremulous
lips
he
sobbed
out
answers
to
the
senior
s
questions
like
a
bashful
witness
affirming
his
attorney
s
suggestions
when
graham
took
a
part
in
the
questioning
the
boy
s
voice
grew
yet
more
nervous
and
shrill
words
and
expressions
penetrated
to
the
eager
ears
in
the
outer
room
bosworth
threw
off
his
pretence
of
indifference
and
sat
bolt
upright
listening
with
all
his
might
but
he
was
destined
to
hear
little
eddy
s
whining
voice
suddenly
shot
to
a
high
key
broke
and
dwindled
abruptly
to
a
gasp
and
a
gurgle
a
chair
slipped
on
the
smooth
floor
and
an
inert
body
struck
the
hard
surface
with
a
dull
thud
in
his
nervous
state
dick
could
restrain
himself
no
longer
throwing
police
duties
to
the
winds
he
rushed
into
the
inner
room
where
graham
and
varrell
were
bending
over
eddy
s
collapsed
form
varrell
still
holding
the
boy
s
head
as
he
had
caught
it
close
to
the
floor
and
the
principal
staring
in
horror
at
the
twitching
face
it
s
a
fit
varrell
was
saying
i
ve
seen
a
case
like
it
before
comes
from
indigestion
you
want
to
loosen
his
clothes
and
keep
him
from
biting
his
dr
kenneth
at
once
exclaimed
graham
catching
sight
of
melvin
at
his
elbow
dick
hurried
back
to
the
room
which
he
had
just
left
it
was
empty
he
stood
an
instant
staring
blankly
at
the
vacant
room
then
turned
to
the
others
a
bewildered
face
bosworth
s
gone
he
exclaimed
excitedly
shall
get
the
doctor
at
once
repeated
graham
never
mind
bosworth
the
command
was
explicit
and
yet
the
boy
hesitated
his
lips
came
together
and
parted
in
he
got
no
further
however
for
varrell
interrupted
him
before
the
word
was
out
hurry
up
can
t
you
don
t
stop
to
talk
it
was
the
sharp
stinging
tone
in
which
the
words
were
spoken
and
the
warning
look
flashed
from
varrell
s
gray
eyes
as
he
uttered
them
that
sent
dick
flying
from
the
house
in
five
minutes
he
was
back
again
having
met
the
school
doctor
at
the
door
of
his
office
eddy
was
already
reviving
come
let
s
get
away
said
varrell
after
they
had
watched
operations
for
a
few
minutes
in
silence
they
don
t
need
us
any
the
doors
had
hardly
closed
behind
them
when
melvin
began
fiercely
well
well
what
returned
varrell
coolly
why
did
you
make
me
let
that
fellow
go
varrell
laughed
because
graham
evidently
wanted
him
to
go
he
had
his
wits
about
him
if
you
had
lost
but
why
persisted
dick
put
yourself
in
his
place
and
you
ll
see
retorted
varrell
bosworth
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
is
a
felon
graham
can
not
condone
a
criminal
offence
and
he
doesn
t
want
the
scandal
of
a
public
trial
in
the
courts
bosworth
has
helped
us
out
by
running
away
he
ll
never
be
seen
again
in
this
town
now
come
up
to
the
room
and
i
ll
tell
you
all
about
varrell
s
prediction
proved
true
bosworth
disappeared
suddenly
and
completely
his
mother
came
a
day
or
two
later
and
spent
a
few
hours
in
packing
her
son
s
goods
and
a
few
minutes
in
a
sad
interview
with
the
principal
the
boys
who
had
lost
money
had
it
restored
to
them
through
graham
and
the
thieving
in
the
dormitories
ceased
the
whereabouts
of
the
wretched
bosworth
remained
for
some
time
a
mystery
even
to
his
mother
a
year
later
vincent
who
took
his
meals
at
bosworth
s
in
cambridge
reported
having
seen
a
letter
postmarked
texas
addressed
to
his
landlady
in
handwriting
which
he
thought
he
recognized
in
his
last
college
vacation
marks
ran
across
bosworth
himself
among
a
set
of
gamblers
offering
bets
at
the
professional
ball
games
in
chicago
it
is
safe
to
say
that
they
did
not
renew
their
acquaintance
eddy
relieved
of
the
burden
of
his
secret
convalesced
rapidly
and
was
soon
taken
home
by
his
father
fortunately
for
the
repentant
lad
eddy
himself
an
old
seatonian
had
a
frank
talk
with
graham
before
seeing
his
son
which
deprived
the
dreaded
meeting
of
half
its
terrors
it
was
a
new
idea
to
eddy
that
a
boy
might
be
driven
to
continue
in
an
evil
way
from
which
he
wished
to
escape
through
fear
of
the
uncompromising
harshness
with
which
his
confession
would
be
received
the
parting
word
of
the
principal
sent
the
father
home
somewhat
comforted
by
the
thought
that
there
might
yet
be
a
chance
for
the
boy
to
retrieve
himself
in
the
old
school
for
phil
and
dick
and
wrenn
varrell
the
last
days
of
school
were
pleasantly
uneventful
dick
had
a
peaceful
fortnight
in
which
to
prepare
his
oration
which
he
delivered
with
becoming
gravity
as
if
it
were
a
serious
contribution
to
the
wisdom
of
the
world
wrenn
returned
to
the
modest
tenor
of
his
life
and
when
planter
in
his
class
prophecy
predicted
for
varrell
a
career
which
should
rival
that
of
sherlock
holmes
hardly
half
a
dozen
fellows
in
the
class
understood
the
point
of
the
reference
phil
went
rejoicing
home
at
the
end
of
the
school
term
leaving
his
older
friends
to
miss
his
cheerful
presence
his
study
chair
was
more
than
filled
by
john
curtis
who
settled
himself
in
it
as
the
most
favorable
place
for
grinding
place
which
he
left
only
to
sleep
and
eat
during
the
long
week
which
preceded
the
college
examinations
john
was
rather
subdued
when
the
final
were
said
and
the
fellows
around
him
were
promising
one
another
a
speedy
and
happy
reunion
at
cambridge
or
new
haven
or
hanover
or
some
other
of
the
places
to
which
their
choice
of
college
called
them
melvin
felt
much
concerned
at
the
solemn
look
on
the
big
fellow
s
face
and
the
artless
subterfuges
with
which
he
sought
to
avoid
committing
himself
as
to
his
plans
for
the
future
but
curtis
was
merely
cautious
on
the
fourth
of
july
as
dick
was
condescendingly
helping
his
kid
brother
in
the
serious
task
of
setting
off
fireworks
a
telegram
was
brought
to
him
dated
at
mt
desert
and
bearing
this
simple
legend
in
clear
