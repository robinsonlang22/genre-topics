chapter
i
jacquette
it
was
nine
o
clock
in
the
evening
when
a
heavy
train
rolled
into
the
union
station
of
a
great
western
city
among
the
passengers
to
alight
was
a
girl
who
glanced
timidly
about
the
big
cavernous
station
before
falling
in
with
the
procession
of
travellers
that
had
begun
to
move
toward
the
suddenly
one
face
shone
clearly
from
among
the
indiscriminate
mass
of
faces
outside
the
iron
gates
and
she
gave
a
glad
little
cry
as
a
tall
boy
stepped
forward
caught
her
suitcase
from
her
and
grasped
her
hand
jacquette
isn
t
it
he
exclaimed
his
dark
eyes
shining
with
welcome
i
d
know
you
anywhere
from
your
but
i
shouldn
t
know
you
she
answered
i
d
no
idea
you
were
so
big
and
and
grand
she
finished
roguishly
as
for
that
i
am
rather
grand
he
laughed
stealing
admiring
glances
at
her
as
he
led
the
way
through
the
crowded
station
to
the
street
i
m
down
here
in
the
governor
s
new
auto
to
meet
a
country
cousin
and
i
find
a
fairy
princess
instead
what
more
could
a
fellow
ask
not
an
automobile
truly
i
ve
never
been
in
one
oh
well
you
ll
do
a
lot
of
things
in
channing
that
you
never
did
in
brookdale
here
s
the
machine
just
step
in
and
be
comfortable
while
i
look
after
your
he
gave
an
order
to
the
respectful
chauffeur
and
disappeared
into
the
station
while
jacquette
willard
looked
after
him
feeling
that
she
had
suddenly
entered
a
new
world
she
sat
up
very
straight
brushing
a
bit
of
lint
from
the
jacket
of
her
and
more
than
once
she
patted
the
sunny
mist
of
hair
about
her
face
and
put
both
hands
to
the
jaunty
hat
to
make
sure
that
it
was
poised
exactly
as
it
should
be
in
a
few
minutes
her
tall
cousin
came
back
and
seated
himself
beside
her
and
then
they
went
spinning
along
the
brilliantly
lighted
streets
toward
her
uncle
s
home
it
seems
like
a
fairy
story
to
me
quis
she
said
looking
up
at
him
with
a
shy
smile
didn
t
i
tell
you
you
were
the
princess
marquis
answered
gaily
do
you
know
there
s
a
pink
rose
in
our
conservatory
that
looks
just
like
you
only
it
lacks
the
eyes
poor
rose
your
pictures
showed
your
hair
was
curly
but
they
didn
t
tell
the
gold
colour
of
it
and
those
stunning
braids
didn
t
show
either
wonder
if
the
girls
will
make
you
put
up
your
hair
what
girls
oh
the
bunch
i
ll
show
you
morning
nicest
girls
in
marston
high
school
do
you
mean
yes
we
never
stop
to
put
on
the
school
though
everybody
knows
marston
it
s
famous
all
through
the
west
for
its
football
team
i
m
mighty
glad
you
came
while
i
m
a
senior
here
instead
of
waiting
till
next
year
when
i
ll
be
off
at
college
i
can
give
you
no
end
of
pointers
by
the
way
i
liked
it
just
now
when
you
said
i
suppose
you
know
about
your
mother
and
my
father
getting
our
frenchy
sounding
names
out
of
the
same
old
novel
funny
wasn
t
it
i
have
to
answer
to
markee
about
half
the
time
the
fellows
do
it
to
guy
me
i
wonder
what
you
d
think
if
i
should
call
you
jack
i
d
like
it
she
agreed
promptly
i
never
had
a
all
right
that
s
settled
don
t
you
think
it
s
queer
we
feel
so
well
acquainted
just
from
the
letters
we
ve
written
do
you
realise
that
it
s
twelve
years
since
i
even
saw
you
we
lived
abroad
ten
whole
years
you
know
mother
was
saying
last
night
that
i
d
spent
two
years
more
of
my
life
in
europe
than
in
this
country
so
far
i
m
a
pretty
good
american
though
for
all
that
the
last
two
years
here
in
channing
seem
worth
more
than
the
whole
ten
on
the
other
side
my
father
feels
the
same
way
too
and
he
s
mighty
happy
to
think
that
you
and
aunt
sula
and
grandfather
are
coming
to
live
so
near
and
perhaps
we
re
not
happy
about
it
too
you
ought
to
hear
the
plans
aunt
sula
and
i
have
made
for
this
winter
we
re
going
to
make
the
most
of
the
chance
to
hear
good
music
and
see
all
the
exhibitions
at
the
art
institute
for
one
whew
how
cultured
we
are
we
aren
t
yet
but
wait
jacquette
laughed
then
she
added
seriously
our
plans
aren
t
all
selfish
though
we
re
hoping
we
can
interest
grandfather
in
some
of
the
new
things
and
make
him
happier
he
has
been
so
lonely
since
grandmother
died
i
suppose
he
has
how
soon
are
they
coming
oh
it
will
be
six
weeks
or
two
months
before
aunt
sula
can
settle
up
things
and
leave
brookdale
i
ought
to
be
there
to
help
her
but
she
was
so
anxious
to
have
me
begin
school
the
first
day
that
she
made
me
then
you
re
going
to
stay
at
our
house
six
weeks
or
more
that
s
great
perhaps
you
ll
make
up
your
mind
to
live
with
us
all
the
time
after
aunt
sula
wouldn
t
hear
of
that
jacquette
said
smiling
she
thinks
i
belong
to
her
as
much
as
if
i
were
her
very
own
daughter
i
guess
i
do
too
she
s
taken
care
of
me
ever
since
i
was
three
years
old
you
three
marquis
repeated
in
a
softened
tone
were
you
that
little
when
your
father
and
mother
died
jack
she
nodded
a
wistful
look
creeping
into
the
hazel
eyes
and
they
were
both
silent
for
a
little
the
automobile
had
turned
on
to
a
fashionable
boulevard
and
was
skimming
along
like
the
wind
presently
a
grey
stone
house
loomed
before
them
here
we
are
cried
marquis
and
a
minute
later
uncle
mac
and
aunt
fanny
were
welcoming
the
brookdale
niece
to
their
city
home
aunt
fanny
was
tall
and
distinguished
looking
quis
was
like
her
jacquette
saw
that
at
a
glance
uncle
mac
was
stout
and
and
dear
and
kind
after
the
first
greetings
he
held
his
niece
off
at
arm
s
length
and
looked
deep
into
her
eyes
your
mother
s
own
girl
he
said
with
a
mist
in
his
voice
fanny
let
s
keep
her
for
ours
after
at
any
rate
we
shall
be
very
glad
to
keep
her
for
ours
until
father
granville
and
sula
come
malcolm
aunt
fanny
answered
in
even
tones
and
jacquette
glancing
shyly
up
at
the
white
profile
of
her
statuesque
aunt
felt
suddenly
that
she
knew
who
ruled
her
uncle
s
home
malcolm
granville
was
a
woman
who
prided
herself
on
her
practical
common
sense
and
though
she
was
very
willing
to
receive
jacquette
into
her
luxurious
home
for
a
visit
she
had
no
intention
of
allowing
her
husband
to
put
any
foolish
ideas
even
for
a
minute
into
the
mind
of
his
niece
as
she
reasoned
jacquette
with
the
modest
inheritance
left
to
her
by
her
father
was
very
suitably
placed
in
the
unpretentious
home
of
her
grandfather
and
unmarried
aunt
and
there
was
no
good
reason
for
saying
or
doing
anything
which
might
cause
her
to
feel
discontented
with
this
arrangement
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
was
not
the
slightest
danger
jacquette
was
too
devotedly
attached
to
her
adopted
mother
to
consider
for
a
moment
the
thought
of
leaving
her
and
she
felt
an
impulse
to
tell
aunt
fanny
so
on
the
spot
but
she
controlled
it
and
after
a
few
days
she
learned
as
people
always
did
to
make
allowances
for
aunt
fanny
s
way
and
to
appreciate
her
kindness
in
spite
of
it
now
i
m
going
to
carry
this
girl
straight
off
to
bed
aunt
fanny
declared
presently
after
jacquette
relieved
of
her
wraps
and
seated
in
a
rocker
before
the
fireplace
in
the
library
had
been
served
with
a
dainty
tray
of
refreshments
you
see
she
can
t
eat
a
mouthful
even
though
she
confesses
to
not
having
taken
dinner
on
the
train
i
believe
she
has
swallowed
three
sips
of
milk
and
one
nibble
of
that
roll
altogether
she
s
tired
and
excited
and
the
longer
she
stays
here
answering
your
questions
malcolm
the
more
tired
she
ll
oh
mother
it
s
disgracefully
early
marquis
protested
but
uncle
malcolm
leaning
back
in
his
big
leather
chair
smiled
guess
you
re
right
fanny
he
agreed
if
she
s
going
to
begin
school
morning
the
sooner
those
pretty
eyes
are
shut
the
there
won
t
be
any
to
speak
of
the
first
day
nothing
but
fun
and
i
had
forty
things
more
to
say
to
her
marquis
was
still
grumbling
as
he
rose
to
say
but
his
mother
s
word
was
law
and
even
marquis
grudgingly
admitted
her
wisdom
next
morning
when
he
saw
the
bright
rosy
girl
that
emerged
from
the
good
night
s
rest
as
he
started
for
school
with
jacquette
after
breakfast
he
turned
and
looked
her
over
with
a
smile
of
satisfaction
well
what
is
it
country
cousin
she
asked
him
saucily
not
much
i
meant
fairy
princess
when
i
said
it
i
was
just
thinking
that
if
your
dress
were
an
inch
or
two
longer
you
d
look
precious
little
like
a
there
s
a
double
hem
in
all
of
them
to
let
out
if
i
need
to
jacquette
confided
to
him
but
aunt
sula
thought
they
were
long
enough
for
oh
well
the
sigma
pi
girls
will
post
you
on
all
those
the
sigma
what
that
s
your
sorority
sigma
pi
epsilon
i
ve
arranged
with
the
girls
to
rush
you
first
thing
and
they
re
sure
to
bid
you
in
a
few
to
bid
me
i
ll
bet
you
don
t
know
what
a
sorority
is
oh
brookdale
brookdale
think
of
a
fairy
princess
buried
in
brookdale
why
every
high
school
worthy
of
the
name
nowadays
has
its
societies
and
at
marston
we
have
more
fraternities
and
sororities
than
i
could
tell
you
about
in
an
hour
the
only
ones
worth
mentioning
though
are
the
ones
with
national
charters
the
little
local
ones
are
punk
the
people
that
can
t
make
the
nationals
go
into
them
but
it
goes
without
saying
that
the
sorority
i
m
going
to
get
you
into
is
the
most
exclusive
set
in
the
school
wait
till
you
see
the
why
quis
i
do
know
about
secret
societies
in
schools
i
ve
read
a
lot
about
the
teachers
opposing
yes
i
suppose
you
have
but
they
haven
t
any
right
to
do
it
is
it
their
business
to
forbid
our
joining
a
club
provided
our
parents
are
willing
as
for
the
channing
board
of
education
i
guess
we
ve
hushed
it
up
for
one
while
it
made
a
rule
last
year
shutting
off
fraternity
and
sorority
members
from
a
lot
of
high
school
privileges
trying
to
freeze
out
secret
societies
that
way
you
see
and
we
just
took
up
a
collection
and
hired
a
lawyer
and
got
an
injunction
against
their
enforcing
that
rule
they
haven
t
any
legal
right
to
do
such
a
jacquette
listened
with
a
growing
sense
of
her
own
lack
of
information
but
don
t
you
think
there
s
anything
then
in
all
this
fuss
about
fraternities
making
class
distinctions
in
school
she
asked
cautiously
not
a
thing
i
ll
tell
you
how
it
is
all
the
fellows
that
are
really
worth
anything
get
into
some
fraternity
or
other
and
the
same
with
the
they
turned
a
corner
and
came
within
sight
of
marston
high
school
it
was
a
large
grey
stone
building
rising
abruptly
from
the
street
and
separated
from
it
only
by
two
grass
plots
one
on
each
side
of
the
walk
leading
to
the
main
entrance
a
few
scrub
oaks
straggling
relics
of
the
old
forest
which
had
once
flourished
where
the
hurrying
striving
city
now
stood
shaded
the
windows
at
the
south
but
except
for
these
everything
was
bare
as
different
as
possible
from
the
pleasant
grounds
surrounding
the
little
brookdale
school
oh
are
we
here
jacquette
cried
i
wanted
to
ask
you
about
planning
my
course
lots
of
time
for
that
he
told
her
you
won
t
do
a
thing
but
be
rushed
and
just
what
is
being
rushed
please
here
s
somebody
that
will
show
you
he
answered
coming
to
a
sudden
stop
on
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
the
school
building
where
a
group
of
girls
were
talking
together
they
greeted
marquis
gaily
and
jacquette
s
name
had
hardly
been
pronounced
before
they
came
fluttering
about
her
like
butterflies
after
a
minute
marquis
laughingly
withdrew
promising
to
look
her
up
later
jacquette
had
never
experienced
anything
like
this
she
was
flattered
and
petted
her
beautiful
braids
envied
her
lovely
colour
raved
over
while
she
was
being
presented
to
this
and
that
girl
and
yielded
reluctantly
by
one
to
the
other
until
she
had
met
about
twenty
there
the
introductions
stopped
plenty
of
other
girls
and
boys
were
standing
about
or
passing
in
and
out
of
the
school
building
but
it
was
evident
that
she
was
to
meet
no
one
outside
of
this
particular
set
she
was
satisfied
though
for
she
had
begun
to
believe
what
marquis
had
said
about
these
being
the
nicest
girls
in
marston
high
as
she
stood
there
in
the
warm
september
sunshine
she
found
herself
taking
notes
of
the
silk
and
muslin
gowns
worn
by
these
new
friends
and
of
the
elaborate
styles
of
one
girl
who
had
been
introduced
as
blanche
gross
was
describing
a
hat
that
she
had
bought
just
to
wear
in
the
house
at
teas
and
jacquette
fresh
from
brookdale
wondered
what
aunt
sula
would
say
to
that
she
wished
quis
had
told
her
that
hats
were
not
worn
outdoors
in
channing
not
one
of
the
girls
had
any
covering
on
her
head
the
chatter
about
her
went
on
merrily
now
and
then
a
new
girl
was
brought
into
the
charmed
circle
and
passed
around
just
as
jacquette
had
been
but
no
one
seemed
to
think
of
going
into
school
jacquette
did
not
quite
understand
she
was
only
sure
that
it
was
all
fascinating
and
that
she
was
glad
to
be
a
part
of
it
don
t
we
go
in
to
see
about
our
classes
pretty
soon
she
asked
presently
of
louise
markham
a
jolly
senior
in
a
white
linen
suit
who
seemed
to
have
taken
her
especially
under
her
wing
oh
no
etta
brainerd
the
talkative
girl
of
the
crowd
spoke
before
louise
could
answer
sorority
girls
never
register
until
second
but
we
may
have
to
reform
our
ways
in
that
respect
girls
laughed
louise
did
you
know
the
board
of
education
took
off
five
teachers
from
marston
faculty
last
year
because
the
enrollment
of
pupils
on
the
first
day
was
only
a
thousand
next
day
you
know
after
the
rest
of
us
had
registered
there
were
nearly
fifteen
hundred
and
the
teachers
didn
t
like
it
a
bit
it
made
their
work
so
much
oh
they
always
fuss
about
something
said
etta
carelessly
we
have
to
take
care
of
the
interests
of
our
sorority
first
day
guess
we
aren
t
going
to
let
the
kappa
delts
run
off
with
the
best
girls
while
we
re
registering
etta
was
the
tallest
girl
in
the
group
her
brown
hair
was
drawn
to
the
top
of
her
head
in
a
fluffy
knot
and
her
skirts
almost
touched
the
ground
as
she
spoke
she
was
readjusting
the
sorority
pin
on
the
front
of
her
white
lace
waist
it
has
to
be
exactly
over
the
heart
she
explained
with
a
smile
as
she
saw
jacquette
watching
her
we
re
going
to
have
a
spread
after
a
while
and
we
want
you
to
come
louise
murmured
to
jacquette
that
s
what
rushing
means
quis
said
i
should
tell
you
we
pick
out
the
girls
we
think
we
may
want
and
give
them
a
good
time
spreads
and
so
on
and
then
if
we
find
they
re
all
right
we
bid
them
sigma
pi
ask
them
to
join
you
but
while
louise
was
speaking
jacquette
had
suddenly
recognised
a
girl
who
had
spent
the
summer
with
an
aunt
in
brookdale
a
few
years
earlier
margaret
howland
she
cried
darting
forward
and
catching
her
by
the
arm
jacquette
willard
where
did
you
drop
down
from
jacquette
wondered
as
she
explained
at
the
curious
expression
which
crossed
margaret
s
face
i
never
dreamed
you
went
to
this
school
jacquette
finished
i
was
going
to
look
you
up
the
first
chance
i
had
but
now
we
ll
see
each
other
every
day
isn
t
it
splendid
yes
i
m
awfully
glad
to
see
you
but
margaret
hesitated
but
you
re
so
big
you
can
t
play
with
a
little
freshy
no
indeed
but
i
m
afraid
if
quis
granville
is
your
cousin
jack
a
surprised
voice
interrupted
and
turning
jacquette
found
quis
looking
down
at
her
in
unmistakable
disapproval
good
morning
miss
howland
he
added
lifting
his
cap
to
margaret
excuse
my
cousin
will
you
some
of
the
girls
want
it
was
done
in
a
twinkling
margaret
was
swallowed
up
in
the
bevy
of
girls
who
had
gathered
about
while
she
talked
with
jacquette
and
marquis
carried
off
his
cousin
in
gleeful
triumph
what
in
the
world
he
began
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
earshot
how
did
she
ever
get
you
get
me
what
do
you
mean
jacquette
protested
that
s
margaret
howland
a
darling
girl
i
knew
in
brookdale
three
years
the
mischief
you
did
she
s
one
of
the
strongest
workers
in
kappa
delta
and
you
mustn
t
have
a
thing
to
do
with
her
at
this
stage
of
the
game
or
you
ll
lose
all
your
chances
with
the
sigma
pi
girls
now
mind
jack
you
re
new
here
i
know
the
ground
and
you
won
t
be
sorry
if
you
take
my
advice
my
frat
is
beta
sigma
the
best
in
school
hardest
to
get
into
finest
frat
house
highest
dues
and
all
that
the
only
sorority
that
ranks
with
it
is
sigma
pi
epsilon
i
want
you
to
have
the
best
understand
and
as
he
ended
he
handed
her
over
to
louise
markham
whose
laugh
had
rippled
out
gaily
when
she
saw
them
coming
i
ll
not
let
her
get
away
again
she
told
marquis
her
dark
eyes
twinkling
as
she
put
one
arm
around
jacquette
we
love
her
too
much
already
to
trust
her
in
the
enemy
s
indeed
we
do
chorussed
half
a
dozen
girls
gathering
about
and
before
she
realised
what
was
happening
jacquette
had
been
bewitched
into
forgetting
all
about
margaret
the
morning
passed
and
when
the
noon
hour
came
the
girls
adjourned
to
the
sigma
pi
spread
it
was
given
at
etta
brainerd
s
house
and
jacquette
found
that
it
meant
sandwiches
and
salads
hot
chocolate
olives
cake
and
candy
all
served
picnic
fashion
with
sorority
songs
and
laughter
and
chatter
when
the
party
dispersed
late
in
the
afternoon
some
one
whispered
to
jacquette
that
she
was
to
stay
and
as
soon
as
the
other
guests
had
gone
the
sigma
pi
girls
gathered
about
and
told
her
that
they
had
decided
to
ask
her
to
join
their
sorority
then
louise
markham
who
had
completely
won
jacquette
s
heart
walked
home
with
her
to
tell
quis
what
a
success
she
had
been
with
the
girls
and
to
charge
him
that
he
must
help
her
with
an
important
letter
which
she
was
to
write
to
her
aunt
sula
that
evening
accordingly
after
dinner
marquis
and
jacquette
retired
to
the
library
for
consultation
jacquette
took
up
a
pen
tia
mia
were
the
first
words
she
wrote
what
s
that
quis
demanded
looking
over
her
shoulder
pronounced
jacquette
it
s
spanish
for
my
we
found
it
in
a
book
and
i
thought
it
was
cunning
so
tia
has
been
my
pet
name
for
aunt
sula
ever
oh
well
go
on
quis
consented
and
after
much
this
was
the
letter
they
sent
tia
mia
the
first
day
at
school

been
simply
glorious
and
now
i
have
a
great
favour

have
been
asked
to
join
the
nicest
girls
club
in
marston
high
school

i
do
it
of
course
i
d
rather
wait
till
you
are
here
and
could
know
the
girls
too
but
quis
says
i
ought
to
accept
when
i
m
asked

a
great
compliment
and
they
may
never
invite
me
again
it
s
called

sorority

sisterhood

it
stands
for
the
highest

darling
please
don
t
make
me
lose
this
chance

because
you

not
here
to
judge
for
yourself
trust
me
i
don
t
know
what
the
dues
will
be
but
not
large

thinks
and
i
could
pay
them
out
of
the
money
set
aside
for
my
education
it
s
really
a
part
of
my
high
school
education

your
chapter
ii
mademoiselle
next
morning
dawned
bright
and
clear
another
day
like
midsummer
and
when
jacquette
began
to
dress
a
remark
that
louise
had
made
on
the
way
home
from
the
spread
the
night
before
came
into
her
mind
this
is
your
travelling
suit
isn
t
it
louise
had
said
it
s
so
appropriate
plain
and
dark
i
love
plain
things
for
travelling
don
t
you
with
this
in
her
thoughts
jacquette
discarded
the
simple
suit
she
had
intended
to
wear
and
took
out
instead
a
fluffy
mull
which
aunt
sula
had
advised
her
to
put
on
often
for
dinner
while
she
was
visiting
at
uncle
malcolm
s
she
felt
repaid
for
the
change
when
she
saw
aunt
fanny
s
welcoming
smile
and
quis
s
glance
of
admiration
at
breakfast
uncle
mac
studied
her
without
comment
but
just
as
she
was
starting
for
school
he
put
his
arm
around
her
and
whispered
tenderly
your
mother
s
own
daughter
that
s
what
you
are
don
t
let
em
spoil
you
with
their
secret
societies
and
things
keep
your
pretty
head
the
pretty
head
hatless
this
morning
nodded
confidently
as
jacquette
tripped
away
at
marquis
s
side
louise
markham
joined
them
at
the
corner
and
a
block
or
two
farther
on
marquis
excused
himself
to
walk
with
a
boy
who
had
met
them
at
one
of
the
we
needn
t
feel
jealous
louise
said
with
a
smile
as
marquis
left
them
it
isn
t
because
he
prefers
clarence
mullen
s
company
to
what
made
him
go
then
jacquette
asked
oh
business
the
beta
sigs
want
to
pledge
that
little
fellow
and
two
or
three
other
fraternities
are
after
him
too
so
quis
couldn
t
lose
this
chance
of
courting
but
louise
that
boy
has
such
a
queer
face
i
thought
so
the
minute
i
saw
him
is
he
nice
louise
shrugged
her
shoulders
his
father
has
loads
of
money
and
a
in
his
you
don
t
mean
to
say
that
quis
s
fraternity
would
choose
a
boy
for
those
things
there
was
a
scandalised
note
in
jacquette
s
voice
and
louise
laughed
not
really
she
said
i
don
t
actually
know
anything
against
that
mullen
boy
but
somehow
i
feel
just
as
you
do
about
him
creepy
and
i
can
t
help
thinking
that
his
father
s
financial
position
may
have
a
little
to
do
with
all
the
fraternities
rushing
him
so
hard
maybe
that
s
unjust
i
don
t
know
but
i
do
know
jacquette
that
when
a
girl
can
look
as
much
like
a
flower
as
you
do
in
that
pink
dress
she
has
no
business
ever
to
wear
plain
oh
louise
jacquette
protested
looking
more
like
a
flower
than
ever
as
they
turned
into
the
school
entrance
and
walked
up
to
the
office
to
register
when
they
came
out
into
the
hall
again
louise
said
well
you
re
assigned
to
room
i
see
that
means
you
re
going
to
bloom
in
mademoiselle
s
i
most
wish
i
were
a
freshman
or
sophomore
so
i
could
be
there
with
you
we
seniors
have
to
go
up
on
the
top
what
is
mademoiselle
s
rose
garden
come
in
here
and
see
was
the
answer
as
louise
led
jacquette
into
room
and
straight
to
mademoiselle
dubois
s
desk
where
a
half
dozen
pupils
were
standing
in
line
waiting
for
the
french
teacher
to
assign
them
seats
in
her
study
room
illustration
as
she
was
starting
for
school
uncle
mac
put
his
arms
around
mademoiselle
a
slight
figure
dressed
in
black
was
writing
busily
but
after
a
moment
she
lifted
her
head
and
fixed
a
pair
of
searching
eyes
on
jacquette
instantly
the
girl
was
conscious
of
a
forceful
character
masked
by
a
dimpling
face
which
revealed
nothing
jacquette
willard
mademoiselle
repeated
after
louise
in
honeyed
tones
a
little
french
name
is
it
not
but
it
is
not
a
little
french
girl
no
ah
a
cousin
of
marquis
granville
did
you
say
my
cunning
chicken
i
am
charmed
to
meet
you
you
are
going
to
be
my
child
for
i
know
your
cousin
well
and
indeed
i
am
so
fond
of
that
little
wretch
jacquette
gasped
and
before
she
could
stammer
a
word
in
reply
louise
s
laugh
had
bubbled
forth
your
old
abominable
laugh
my
sweet
pet
mademoiselle
chided
turning
to
louise
and
speaking
in
the
same
mellifluous
voice
you
have
carried
it
through
high
school
and
you
will
carry
it
into
womanhood
it
is
scandalous
dearie
you
shall
have
that
seat
next
the
aisle
my
little
she
added
addressing
jacquette
again
the
one
in
the
second
row
honey
and
louise
the
dear
child
shall
help
you
make
out
your
programme
for
the
quarter
you
see
that
all
the
classes
and
all
the
hours
are
plainly
written
on
the
board
don
t
you
dearie
go
now
louise
and
help
the
little
willard
before
the
bell
there
how
do
you
like
mademoiselle
louise
whispered
as
soon
as
they
were
seated
all
the
other
teachers
in
high
school
call
you
miss
but
not
mademoiselle
she
makes
you
feel
just
at
first
as
if
you
d
dropped
back
into
kindergarten
but
don
t
deceive
yourself
you
haven
t
there
isn
t
a
more
respected
better
obeyed
teacher
in
marston
than
mademoiselle
dubois
and
as
for
french
what
she
doesn
t
know
about
it
isn
t
worth
learning
did
you
notice
how
she
spoke
about
my
laugh
she
s
just
right
i
can
t
control
it
to
save
my
life
but
isn
t
she
great
great
i
should
think
she
was
jacquette
agreed
impulsively
i
m
afraid
of
her
and
i
like
her
at
the
same
minute
my
cunning
chicken
louise
i
ve
had
one
year
of
french
at
home
i
hope
i
can
take
my
second
year
with
all
right
let
s
plan
it
that
and
the
girls
fell
to
work
on
jacquette
s
programme
tap
tap
tap
sounded
on
mademoiselle
s
desk
when
they
had
nearly
finished
now
my
little
flock
said
the
small
frenchwoman
standing
behind
her
desk
to
address
the
roomful
of
fifty
young
people
whose
ages
ranged
from
fifteen
to
eighteen
my
sweet
pets
she
paused
and
dimpled
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
i
will
explain
to
you
the
meaning
of
the
bells
you
see
i
never
have
the
least
particle
of
trouble
with
the
dear
children
who
study
in
my
room
not
the
least
particle
after
i
have
once
explained
the
meaning
of
the
bells
it
is
this
first
bell
no
walking
second
bell
no
talking
and
third
bell
her
voice
had
dropped
almost
to
a
whisper
when
the
third
bell
rings
in
mademoiselle
s
room
it
is
always
as
as
a
little
rose
garden
what
did
i
tell
you
murmured
louise
see
how
they
strain
their
ears
to
catch
every
word
she
if
i
hear
any
voice
mademoiselle
s
hushed
tones
went
on
after
she
had
cast
one
keen
glance
at
louise
if
there
is
ever
any
sound
at
all
i
know
it
must
be
an
echo
from
that
bad
room
across
the
hall
for
my
children
never
give
me
the
least
particle
of
trouble
the
sweet
pets
very
good
you
are
just
as
i
knew
you
would
be
dear
children
now
alice
honey
when
you
registered
yesterday
did
you
not
ask
to
be
excused
from
drawing
this
quarter
yes
mademoiselle
dubois
answered
a
tall
serious
looking
sophomore
who
had
evidently
met
mademoiselle
before
well
sweet
pet
did
you
bring
your
note
of
excuse
from
mamma
no
mademoiselle
i
forgot
i
am
so
sorry
alice
because
you
see
dearie
you
must
go
right
home
after
it
and
that
means
you
will
miss
the
first
and
second
period
both
recitations
for
you
and
that
means
lingeringly
and
lovingly
that
means
two
little
zeros
and
you
see
alice
that
it
always
pays
in
mademoiselle
s
room
for
her
dear
little
peacocks
to
do
everything
just
at
the
right
little
minute
because
if
they
don
t
it
means
trot
she
pointed
a
tiny
finger
at
the
door
and
to
jacquette
s
wondering
amazement
tall
alice
meekly
departed
as
the
door
closed
behind
her
mademoiselle
assumed
a
meditative
expression
there
are
three
people
talking
in
this
room
at
present
she
said
softly
addressing
a
distant
spot
on
the
ceiling
i
am
one
of
them
i
wonder
who
the
other
two
could
be
chester
she
added
suddenly
fixing
her
eyes
on
a
corner
of
the
room
where
a
sly
whispering
was
in
progress
take
your
books
honey
and
come
to
this
row
at
once
no
not
there
she
demurred
as
the
big
fellow
sheepishly
obeyed
i
reserve
those
seats
for
my
french
class
and
if
you
should
be
studying
there
and
i
should
imagine
you
were
one
of
my
french
class
who
was
not
paying
attention
you
might
get
your
sweet
little
ears
boxed
now
as
i
was
about
to
say
when
i
was
so
interrupted
but
the
things
mademoiselle
wished
to
say
had
to
be
postponed
for
the
bell
sounded
and
the
pupils
of
her
second
year
french
class
some
from
her
own
room
and
some
from
other
rooms
began
to
assemble
in
the
front
rows
louise
gave
jacquette
s
hand
a
farewell
squeeze
and
hurried
away
to
a
class
of
her
own
on
the
upper
floor
while
jacquette
left
alone
for
the
first
time
shyly
took
her
place
among
mademoiselle
s
pupils
wondering
as
she
did
so
whether
she
was
likely
to
get
her
sweet
little
ears
boxed
by
sitting
at
the
wrong
desk
the
french
recitation
proved
to
be
a
taking
of
stock
by
mademoiselle
of
her
class
s
stage
of
advancement
but
it
served
at
the
same
time
to
fix
in
the
minds
of
those
who
had
not
worked
with
her
before
the
necessity
of
keeping
eyes
and
ears
open
early
in
the
hour
she
called
on
arline
grant
a
much
young
lady
to
give
the
rule
under
which
a
certain
word
preceded
the
verb
in
a
french
sentence
they
were
discussing
arline
was
silent
class
said
mademoiselle
we
will
sing
for
arline
a
little
song
that
we
learned
at
the
beginning
of
our
first
year
in
french
all
together
ready

verse
chanting

arline

you

my
pet
arline

it

mademoiselle
exclaimed
brightly
we
have
taught
arline
something
then
she
looked
sharply
at
her
book
and
said
in
a
surprised
tone
i
notice
mon
amie
printed
in
the
next
sentence
mon
a
masculine
pronoun
when
the
friend
referred
to
is
feminine
a
misprint
is
it
not
scratch
it
out
everyone
of
you
and
write
the
feminine
ma
in
its
the
pupils
obediently
made
the
change
class
rise
mademoiselle
commanded
and
the
class
rose
now
all
who
scratched
that
out
sit
down
she
continued
and
everyone
except
jacquette
sat
down
my
little
willard
said
mademoiselle
in
evident
surprise
what
are
walking
around
here
for
because
i
didn
t
scratch
it
out
jacquette
replied
blushing
furiously
and
why
not
the
deep
dimples
appeared
in
mademoiselle
s
cheeks
because
the
pronoun
mon
retains
the
masculine
form
before
a
feminine
noun
beginning
with
a
vowel
or
h
mute
jacquette
faltered
frightened
almost
out
of
her
voice
at
finding
herself
the
only
one
who
knew
it
excellent
dearie
i
am
charmed
you
may
be
seated
and
for
the
rest
of
you
zero
mademoiselle
pronounced
dramatically
i
don
t
wonder
you
look
chagrined
my
pets
she
added
but
you
must
remember
that
in
mademoiselle
dubois
s
classes
it
pays
to
keep
your
wits
about
well
mademoiselle
one
of
the
boys
protested
with
a
shamefaced
grin
it
s
mighty
hard
for
us
to
keep
track
of
all
those
little
things
now
there
s
another
point
bothers
me
the
same
word
has
so
many
different
meanings
in
french
how
are
we
going
to
tell
them
apart
honey
how
can
i
to
have
you
ask
me
so
many
silly
questions
mademoiselle
answered
instantly
folding
her
arms
high
on
her
chest
as
she
spoke
now
listen
there
is
a
big
black
animal
with
long
fuzzy
hair
which
our
president
loves
to
shoot
alas
do
you
know
the
two
meanings
i
gave
to
the
word
bear
in
that
remark
why
clarence
stammered
the
way
you
used
it
mademoiselle
suddenly
waved
her
hand
at
him
as
one
tosses
farewell
to
a
baby
also
in
french
honey
she
told
him
brightly
all
this
was
very
entertaining
to
jacquette
so
much
so
that
her
algebra
class
which
met
in
the
next
hour
and
was
taught
by
the
dignified
pettingill
might
have
seemed
dull
except
for
the
fact
that
she
sat
next
to
etta
brainerd
who
wrote
her
note
after
note
and
slipped
them
into
her
hand
during
the
class
period
it
seemed
jacquette
learned
while
pettingill
imagined
he
was
teaching
her
algebra
that
the
kappa
deltas
were
extremely
anxious
to
get
her
into
their
sorority
on
account
of
margaret
howland
s
former
friendship
with
her
and
that
they
were
planning
to
ask
her
to
their
spread
that
afternoon
to
outwit
them
the
sigma
pi
girls
proposed
to
put
their
colours
pale
blue
and
gold
on
jacquette
even
before
her
aunt
sula
s
consent
should
come
in
that
way
she
could
appear
to
be
already
pledged
to
them
and
could
have
a
good
reason
for
declining
the
kappa
delta
s
invitation
as
soon
as
the
for
luncheon
came
the
sigma
pi
girls
gathered
around
jacquette
we
re
not
asking
you
to
sign
the
pledge
without
your
guardian
s
permission
you
understand
dear
said
louise
markham
holding
the
blue
and
gold
ribbons
in
one
hand
and
the
enamelled
pledge
pin
in
the
other
you
simply
promise
by
wearing
our
colours
this
way
that
if
you
ever
do
go
any
sorority
it
will
be
sigma
and
the
end
of
it
was
that
when
a
delegation
of
kappa
deltas
headed
by
margaret
howland
came
after
jacquette
a
few
minutes
later
they
found
her
wearing
the
blue
and
gold
i
m
dreadfully
sorry
we
can
t
be
in
the
same
sorority
she
told
margaret
honestly
but
my
cousin
thinks
that
s
just
why
i
want
you
to
meet
our
girls
margaret
argued
your
cousin
isn
t
giving
you
a
chance
to
judge
for
that
will
do
margaret
exclaimed
etta
brainerd
stepping
out
of
the
close
background
where
she
had
been
lingering
to
protect
the
sigma
pi
i
hate
to
say
anything
because
i
know
jacquette
used
to
think
a
great
deal
of
you
but
you
know
as
well
as
anyone
that
it
isn
t
honourable
to
try
to
get
another
sorority
s
pledge
to
come
to
your
then
without
giving
jacquette
time
to
do
more
than
cast
an
apologetic
backward
glance
at
margaret
etta
carried
her
off
out
of
harm
s
way
marquis
was
delighted
that
night
when
he
saw
the
sigma
pi
colours
pinned
over
jacquette
s
heart
and
heard
her
story
of
the
day
you
did
exactly
right
he
told
her
it
shows
the
kappa
delts
once
for
all
just
where
you
stand
and
another
thing
i
like
about
it
is
that
it
proves
the
sigma
pi
girls
are
dead
anxious
to
get
you
oh
you
re
all
right
fairy
princess
and
jacquette
glowed
with
pleasure
at
his
words
the
hours
dragged
slowly
for
a
few
days
after
that
in
spite
of
all
the
absorbing
new
happenings
it
was
because
aunt
sula
s
answer
was
being
waited
for
but
it
came
at
last
and
jacquette
waved
it
wildly
out
of
her
bedroom
window
at
louise
markham
who
happened
to
be
passing
louise
louise
she
says
yes
she
cried
joyfully
hurrah
louise
called
back
i
can
t
stop
now
but
i
m
proper
glad
a
delegation
of
us
will
be
over
to
pledge
you
then
jacquette
sat
down
alone
and
read
aunt
sula
s
yes
all
through
again
about
the
girls
club
you
speak
of
the
letter
said
if
it
really
must
be
decided
before
i
come
i
am
going
to
leave
it
to
you
you
are
almost
a
woman
now
and
must
begin
to
make
your
own
decisions
i
am
assuming
of
course
that
uncle
mac
and
aunt
fanny
approve
but
at
the
same
time
i
want
you
to
use
your
own
mind
not
theirs
in
forming
your
opinion
find
out
definitely
about
the
expense
connected
with
it
and
be
sure
from
all
standpoints
that
you
are
not
doing
anything
you
may
regret
later
loving
you
always
chapter
iii
tia
who
mended
the
rip
in
my
glove
jacquette
demanded
as
she
stood
in
her
coat
and
hat
ready
to
start
for
school
tia
you
angel
stop
hiding
behind
that
paper
a
pair
of
brown
eyes
laughed
over
the
top
of
the
newspaper
then
a
slight
woman
in
a
dark
red
morning
gown
emerged
into
sight
i
do
feel
guilty
she
admitted
roguishly
i
ought
to
have
trained
you
so
well
that
you
d
have
mended
it
oh
i
think
you
ve
done
pretty
well
considering
the
material
you
had
to
work
on
was
the
answer
and
jacquette
stopped
to
rearrange
her
hat
before
the
mantel
mirror
as
she
spoke
you
don
t
know
how
afraid
i
was
all
day
yesterday
that
some
of
the
sorority
girls
would
call
me
to
account
for
that
glove
they
re
frightfully
particular
about
such
do
they
mind
little
things
like
a
button
missing
from
a
shoe
aunt
sula
asked
demurely
if
they
do
i
think
i
ll
petition
them
to
labour
with
someone
i
oh
dear
does
that
show
i
didn
t
think
it
could
with
this
long
dress
it
seems
to
me
i
can
t
get
time
to
do
the
things
i
ought
two
months
of
school
had
gone
and
jacquette
was
living
with
her
grandfather
and
aunt
sula
in
a
comfortable
little
home
only
a
few
blocks
from
malcolm
granville
s
large
one
the
blue
and
gold
pin
worn
over
her
heart
proclaimed
that
she
had
been
initiated
into
her
sorority
and
her
beautiful
hair
tucked
up
in
the
back
of
her
neck
and
thoroughly
hidden
by
the
conventional
big
bow
was
witness
to
the
fact
that
the
sigma
pi
girls
considered
long
curly
braids
too
childish
not
only
had
all
the
dresses
brought
from
brookdale
been
lengthened
but
aunt
fannie
prompted
by
uncle
mac
s
fondness
for
his
pretty
niece
had
amused
herself
by
buying
several
new
gowns
for
her
so
that
aunt
sula
whose
loving
interest
had
gone
into
every
garment
jacquette
had
worn
since
she
was
a
tiny
girl
felt
an
odd
pang
as
she
gazed
after
the
smart
young
woman
who
started
for
school
morning
after
morning
in
unfamiliar
costumes
sula
granville
had
not
married
but
her
heart
was
a
mother
heart
and
the
love
she
felt
for
this
child
of
her
only
sister
was
mother
love
ever
since
she
came
to
channing
she
had
been
missing
jacquette
s
sunny
presence
about
the
house
missing
the
spirit
of
helpful
comradeship
which
she
had
grown
to
depend
on
in
the
brookdale
home
but
at
the
same
time
she
had
realised
that
jacquette
was
breathlessly
busy
from
eight
in
the
morning
when
she
started
for
high
school
until
ten
and
after
every
night
and
the
more
she
studied
the
condition
the
more
helpless
she
found
herself
in
coping
with
it
i
know
how
full
your
time
is
she
sympathised
now
couldn
t
you
plan
to
come
home
right
after
school
and
do
some
of
the
sorority
meeting
i
thought
that
was
last
that
was
a
special
this
is
the
regular
one
and
it
s
a
matter
of
loyalty
to
go
we
have
to
pay
a
fine
if
we
re
not
there
and
tia
there
ll
be
rush
doings
a
spread
you
know
that
will
last
till
dinner
time
and
oh
by
the
way
i
want
molly
to
iron
my
lace
waist
so
that
i
can
wear
it
the
kappa
delts
are
working
awfully
hard
to
get
this
girl
we
re
after
and
it
s
understood
that
we
re
to
sport
up
when
we
give
a
spread
so
the
new
girls
will
get
the
impression
that
sigma
pi
is
the
nicest
bunch
there
oh
a
girl
chooses
her
sorority
by
the
way
its
members
dress
does
she
tia
that
s
teasing
first
impressions
do
count
you
i
see
well
this
begins
like
a
gay
week
see
what
the
postman
brought
just
now
uncle
mac
has
sent
us
tickets
for
the
concert
wednesday
afternoon
because
he
noticed
that
the
orchestra
was
going
to
play
some
of
the
grieg
music
you
worked
at
so
hard
last
year
wasn
t
he
good
a
worried
frown
puckered
jacquette
s
forehead
it
was
dear
of
him
she
said
but
we
sigma
pi
girls
have
promised
to
go
up
and
work
in
the
new
sorority
rooms
after
school
wednesday
and
thursday
both
there
are
pillows
to
make
and
curtains
to
hem
and
no
end
of
things
to
oh
well
we
can
change
the
tickets
to
that
won
t
do
jacquette
looked
a
little
as
she
said
it
friday
afternoon
we
all
have
to
sew
on
the
new
robes
we
are
making
for
the
initiation
and
saturday
the
initiation
takes
all
day
you
know
so
there
it
is
every
afternoon
this
week
taken
and
wednesday
night
quis
wants
to
bring
a
beta
sig
friend
of
his
over
here
and
then
i
told
the
girls
i
d
make
my
pillow
for
the
sorority
rooms
before
saturday
that
will
take
at
least
two
evenings
and
you
know
tia
i
have
to
keep
a
time
for
studying
the
apologetic
tone
of
this
last
statement
was
too
much
for
aunt
sula
have
to
keep
time
for
studying
besides
doing
all
that
sorority
work
she
asked
with
an
air
of
gentle
surprise
jacquette
pouted
and
then
laughed
you
make
me
think
of
mademoiselle
yesterday
there
was
an
announcement
of
a
game
on
the
blackboard
and
down
at
the
foot
it
said
come
girls
and
help
us
yell
she
looked
at
it
then
she
said
in
her
sweet
soft
voice
come
girls
and
help
us
so
refined
so
suggestive
of
a
lady
come
girls
and
help
us
not
another
word
and
wasn
t
i
glad
i
hadn
t
written
it
but
that
gentle
sarcasm
belongs
to
her
it
doesn
t
to
you
doesn
t
it
aunt
sula
leaned
forward
and
took
her
girl
s
hands
in
both
of
hers
then
i
ll
say
it
in
my
own
way
jacquette
i
am
making
up
my
mind
that
i
m
sorry
you
joined
the
oh
you
mustn
t
speak
like
that
to
me
tia
it
s
disloyalty
to
sigma
pi
to
listen
to
it
say
anything
you
want
to
about
me
but
i
can
t
let
you
talk
against
my
sorority
there
s
louise
jacquette
added
brightening
suddenly
as
the
sigma
pi
whistle
sounded
outside
i
ll
have
to
go
dearest
and
off
she
flew
hurry
louise
called
as
jacquette
came
down
the
steps
quis
was
here
but
he
couldn
t
wait
the
boys
told
him
there
were
things
doing
over
at
what
kind
of
things
jacquette
asked
half
running
to
keep
up
oh
the
senior
boys
are
up
to
something
again
you
know
last
week
they
painted
those
big
white
all
over
the
and
the
juniors
worked
all
night
i
guess
scrubbing
them
off
with
turpentine
and
putting
in
their
place
quis
wanted
to
drop
it
then
he
s
class
president
you
know
and
wants
to
keep
things
dignified
but
some
of
the
boys
wouldn
t
stop
and
look
there
jacquette
exclaimed
suddenly
as
from
two
blocks
away
both
girls
beheld
a
monster
indian
in
and
feathers
limply
hanging
by
his
neck
to
the
flagstaff
on
the
topmost
peak
of
the
school
building
a
placard
adorned
his
chest
bearing
in
huge
letters
the
legend
that
s
what
they
ve
done
hanged
the
junior
class
in
effigy
but
how
did
they
ever
get
it
up
there
as
the
girls
neared
the
school
a
cluster
of
their
sigma
pi
sisters
opened
almost
silently
to
receive
them
everybody
was
crowding
around
mr
branch
the
principal
to
hear
what
he
was
saying
marquis
as
class
president
had
just
disavowed
all
knowledge
of
the
prank
that
hung
there
all
day
yesterday
to
amuse
people
on
their
way
to
church
said
mr
branch
in
a
tone
of
annoyance
it
s
a
climb
but
the
one
who
put
it
up
knows
how
to
get
it
down
a
silence
fell
who
did
it
he
challenged
after
a
pause
and
then
a
boy
who
had
just
come
racing
down
the
street
elbowed
his
way
through
the
crowd
and
took
off
his
hat
to
the
principal
i
did
sir
he
said
mr
branch
looked
into
the
frank
sunburned
face
you
ought
to
be
past
such
foolishness
drake
he
replied
gravely
but
the
sternness
had
suddenly
gone
from
his
voice
you
re
a
senior
this
year
remember
i
shall
expect
you
to
take
it
down
at
the
noon
who
is
that
boy
louise
jacquette
asked
eagerly
as
mr
branch
strode
into
the
building
and
the
pupils
went
trooping
after
that
s
bobs
drake
the
captain
of
the
football
team
and
idol
of
the
school
didn
t
you
notice
mr
branch
when
he
looked
at
him
that
s
the
way
with
all
the
teachers
they
can
t
be
cross
with
bobs
more
than
a
minute
at
a
shouldn
t
think
they
could
he
s
splendid
but
how
is
he
ever
going
to
bring
that
indian
down
we
ll
see
how
at
noon
i
ll
wait
for
you
at
this
door
said
louise
as
they
parted
promptly
at
twelve
the
two
girls
hurried
out
just
in
time
to
see
bobs
drake
throwing
off
his
coat
and
buttoning
his
blue
sweater
close
the
ring
of
boys
and
girls
around
him
was
growing
thicker
every
minute
i
know
where
there
s
a
ladder
bobs
some
one
volunteered
no
thank
you
said
bobs
cheerfully
and
without
an
instant
s
hesitation
he
began
shinning
up
an
oak
tree
whose
branches
grazed
the
school
windows
from
a
perch
in
that
he
swung
himself
lightly
to
an
addition
which
leaned
against
the
main
building
and
safely
landed
there
made
a
low
bow
to
the
admiring
crowd
now
gathered
after
that
by
the
aid
of
window
ledges
and
cornices
he
clambered
to
the
roof
and
began
to
climb
nimbly
cautiously
the
late
october
wind
crackled
with
a
brittle
sound
through
the
leaves
of
the
oaks
it
flapped
sharply
at
the
girls
gowns
as
they
stood
there
with
the
cold
autumn
sunlight
shining
down
on
their
upturned
faces
suddenly
a
gust
of
it
snatched
bobs
s
cap
from
his
head
and
swept
it
a
block
away
before
the
best
runners
in
marston
could
capture
it
but
bobs
undisturbed
stood
up
on
the
highest
gable
in
the
midst
of
an
exultant
shout
from
his
spectators
and
calmly
watched
the
race
to
the
end
before
he
knelt
again
and
crept
carefully
slowly
along
the
last
straight
to
the
indian
s
side
rah
for
bobs
bobs
bobs
bobs
came
from
below
and
then
a
silence
fell
while
everyone
watched
to
see
what
he
would
do
next
before
they
had
seen
it
was
done
whipping
a
ball
of
heavy
twine
from
his
pocket
bobs
had
tied
one
end
around
the
indian
s
neck
had
cut
the
cords
which
bound
him
to
the
and
was
swiftly
lowering
him
down
the
front
of
the
building
with
a
whoop
seniors
and
juniors
closed
upon
the
helpless
dummy
but
in
the
end
the
seniors
triumphed
and
bore
the
abject
indian
torn
limb
from
limb
to
a
vacant
field
near
by
where
they
promptly
set
fire
to
him
it
was
a
tame
cremation
though
with
few
spectators
for
all
the
girls
and
most
of
the
boys
had
lingered
to
see
that
bobs
got
safely
down
everyone
realised
that
there
was
actual
peril
in
the
feat
he
had
undertaken
so
gaily
and
each
danger
point
passed
in
the
downward
climb
brought
forth
a
noisier
cheering
once
he
missed
his
footing
and
slipped
the
length
of
his
body
down
the
steep
roof
the
crowd
held
its
breath
but
he
stopped
himself
somehow
and
struggled
back
to
safety
amid
a
tremendous
yelling
at
last
leaping
down
to
the
lowest
roof
he
caught
a
branch
of
the
tree
went
hand
over
hand
into
the
boughs
and
slid
down
the
trunk
to
the
ground
where
he
found
himself
looking
straight
into
the
rosy
face
of
a
girl
with
golden
hair
who
was
clapping
her
hands
and
shouting
hurrah
with
the
best
of
them
bobs
had
never
seen
her
until
that
minute
but
involuntarily
his
hand
went
to
his
capless
head
thanks
i
m
sure
he
said
with
a
merry
twinkle
then
his
admirers
closed
around
him
and
carried
him
off
to
the
what
was
that
he
said
to
you
jack
asked
a
resentful
voice
over
her
shoulder
oh
quis
are
you
there
he
said
thanks
that
was
all
i
don
t
know
him
you
see
wasn
t
it
great
great
foolishness
yes
don
t
you
know
you
mustn
t
let
fellows
speak
to
you
until
they
ve
been
introduced
marquis
answered
in
an
undertone
and
jacquette
turning
away
with
the
girls
felt
suddenly
that
the
time
might
come
when
she
should
outgrow
her
cousin
s
the
week
slipped
away
after
that
and
saturday
came
the
sigma
pi
initiation
fixed
for
that
day
was
to
take
place
at
nell
brewster
s
but
early
in
the
forenoon
two
girls
came
down
the
street
leading
a
third
who
was
blindfolded
and
deposited
her
in
the
laundry
at
jacquette
s
home
without
a
word
to
anyone
jacquette
had
already
gone
over
to
nell
s
and
presumably
had
offered
the
use
of
her
house
to
the
sorority
for
a
little
later
miss
granville
found
another
strange
girl
in
the
pantry
taking
a
double
handful
of
cookies
out
of
the
jar
and
still
later
two
more
walked
into
the
front
door
without
greeting
of
any
sort
seated
themselves
in
the
and
staid
there
silent
for
an
hour
aunt
sula
had
some
difficulty
in
explaining
these
initiation
stunts
to
her
courtly
old
father
especially
after
he
had
tried
in
vain
to
make
polite
conversation
with
the
two
girls
who
had
been
rendered
deaf
and
dumb
by
their
vow
of
silence
nothing
excuses
such
rudeness
daughter
he
remonstrated
shaking
his
silvery
head
i
don
t
like
this
sorosis
jacquette
is
sorority
father
miss
granville
prompted
with
a
smile
call
it
what
you
will
it
s
just
as
bad
he
persisted
those
girls
are
too
young
to
run
such
a
society
they
ve
proved
it
at
ten
o
clock
that
evening
a
telephone
inquiry
brought
back
from
jacquette
the
word
that
the
initiation
was
over
but
refreshments
were
not
and
that
a
crowd
of
beta
sigs
quis
among
the
number
had
discovered
what
was
going
on
and
had
broken
into
nell
s
house
and
insisted
on
being
served
with
some
of
the
goodies
oh
we
re
having
such
fun
tia
jacquette
concluded
don
t
sit
up
for
me
you
and
grandpa
quis
will
bring
me
home
and
i
ll
come
as
soon
as
i
possibly
old
granville
went
to
rest
then
shaking
his
head
over
the
change
since
the
good
old
days
in
the
country
when
his
daughters
were
young
but
aunt
sula
sat
in
her
room
and
waited
it
was
after
midnight
when
she
finally
heard
the
careful
click
of
the
front
door
latch
and
the
creak
of
the
stairs
as
a
girl
crept
up
the
feasting
at
nell
s
had
lasted
a
little
too
long
and
had
been
a
little
too
noisy
before
the
party
had
dispersed
brewster
a
blunt
outspoken
man
had
come
down
to
the
where
the
boys
were
pelting
each
other
with
cake
and
had
given
them
a
piece
of
his
mind
as
to
proper
hours
and
fitting
behaviour
most
of
the
girls
had
cried
the
boys
had
gone
home
insulted
and
angry
but
all
the
time
deep
in
her
heart
jacquette
had
felt
that
nell
s
father
had
just
cause
for
his
action
and
now
as
she
laid
off
her
wraps
in
her
own
room
she
owned
to
herself
that
she
was
ashamed
of
the
sigma
pi
initiation
not
since
brookdale
had
she
needed
as
she
did
at
that
minute
to
talk
things
over
with
aunt
sula
and
when
she
saw
the
light
still
burning
at
the
end
of
the
hall
she
went
to
the
door
and
peeped
in
sula
granville
in
a
pale
blue
wrapper
sat
before
the
fire
brushing
out
her
long
dark
hair
she
looked
extremely
girlish
in
the
dim
flickering
light
but
jacquette
was
not
thinking
of
this
as
she
paused
in
the
doorway
her
heart
was
hungering
for
the
sympathy
which
had
always
been
hers
at
need
from
the
only
mother
she
had
ever
known
and
she
hesitated
now
because
of
a
vague
unhappy
feeling
that
something
had
come
between
them
it
was
a
relief
then
when
aunt
sula
looking
up
held
out
her
hands
without
a
word
and
the
next
instant
found
jacquette
on
her
knees
with
both
arms
round
the
blue
wrapper
little
by
little
the
story
of
the
evening
came
out
and
when
she
had
heard
it
all
aunt
sula
said
come
down
here
girlie
with
your
head
on
my
knee
the
old
brookdale
the
tired
girl
slipped
to
the
floor
and
a
grateful
mothered
feeling
came
to
her
as
she
felt
a
gentle
hand
smoothing
her
hair
for
a
minute
before
aunt
sula
began
you
told
me
once
jacquette
that
every
girl
who
joined
sigma
pi
was
allowed
to
except
her
mother
or
guardian
when
she
took
her
pledge
of
secrecy
do
you
remember
came
the
doubtful
answer
the
girls
did
say
so
before
i
joined
but
i
ve
found
out
since
that
they
won
t
excuse
your
doing
it
unless
it
s
absolutely
and
the
result
is
as
you
said
the
other
day
that
no
outsider
can
judge
sororities
quite
fairly
because
the
best
part
is
secret
now
i
want
to
judge
sigma
pi
fairly
i
want
you
to
tell
me
all
the
good
and
beautiful
things
about
there
was
a
pause
while
jacquette
thought
this
over
then
she
offered
tentatively
surely
you
ve
noticed
tia
how
much
more
careful
i
am
of
my
personal
appearance
that
s
sorority
good
too
unless
it
leads
you
to
spend
more
money
than
you
can
afford
on
your
wardrobe
and
to
look
down
on
the
girls
who
can
t
dress
so
well
aunt
sula
agreed
it
has
occurred
to
me
though
that
when
this
elaborate
attention
to
dress
crowds
out
time
for
the
care
of
one
s
own
bedroom
the
sorority
hasn
t
taught
quite
daintiness
jacquette
looked
guilty
but
she
went
on
sturdily
a
sorority
encourages
a
spirit
of
sisterhood
tia
we
have
to
take
vows
to
love
each
other
always
and
help
each
other
and
accept
criticism
from
each
other
without
getting
the
echo
was
gentle
what
do
you
think
yourself
jacquette
of
a
sisterhood
with
twenty
girls
which
makes
you
unsisterly
to
all
girls
outside
that
clique
well
at
least
it
trains
us
to
be
loyal
perhaps
but
if
loyalty
to
sigma
pi
makes
you
disloyal
to
duty
at
home
or
in
school
isn
t
there
something
wrong
with
it
into
jacquette
s
thoughts
flashed
the
memory
that
two
of
her
sigma
pi
sisters
had
deliberately
missed
their
afternoon
recitations
the
week
before
because
they
considered
it
necessary
to
take
a
girl
they
were
rushing
to
the
matinee
but
tia
she
hurried
on
defensively
you
forget
its
effect
on
scholarship
we
re
ashamed
to
fall
below
passing
mark
because
our
pin
will
be
taken
off
if
we
aunt
sula
looked
thoughtful
i
wonder
if
a
sorority
can
help
scholarship
while
it
uses
up
so
many
study
hours
oh
it
does
and
then
it
s
good
social
training
for
us
does
it
teach
you
to
give
the
sigma
pi
whistle
to
a
girl
a
block
away
when
i
m
walking
and
talking
with
you
on
the
street
aunt
sula
put
in
quizzically
no
but
that
whistle
is
the
accepted
way
of
hailing
each
other
all
the
girls
do
it
haven
t
you
noticed
here
s
another
good
point
though
a
sorority
interests
nice
girls
in
each
other
instead
of
their
having
their
heads
full
of
boys
and
then
well
isn
t
that
enough
not
quite
don
t
you
think
that
as
long
as
your
pledges
are
forced
to
do
things
which
make
them
a
nuisance
to
outsiders
you
re
giving
outsiders
reason
to
think
you
girls
are
too
young
and
foolish
to
have
charge
of
a
secret
society
you
mean
our
making
that
girl
steal
cookies
jacquette
dimpled
in
spite
of
herself
at
the
recollection
yes
everything
of
that
sort
and
one
more
thing
i
want
to
know
positively
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
sigma
pi
initiation
that
could
offend
the
delicacy
of
any
sensitive
modest
jacquette
recalled
a
certain
rite
at
which
one
of
the
pledges
had
balked
in
the
initiation
the
day
before
and
flushed
uncomfortably
just
then
the
bronze
clock
on
the
mantel
struck
one
with
a
silvery
note
aunt
sula
looked
up
as
if
answering
that
s
so
she
said
it
s
too
late
an
initiation
that
takes
all
day
ought
not
to
run
into
the
night
like
this
jacquette
she
concluded
i
ll
make
this
bargain
with
you
i
ll
be
a
friend
to
sigma
pi
and
never
criticise
it
except
as
i
may
suggest
something
when
we
are
all
alone
if
you
ll
try
your
best
to
change
these
points
i
ve
spoken
oh
tia
jacquette
protested
lifting
her
head
you
forget
that
i
m
one
insignificant
little
freshman
the
girls
wouldn
t
listen
to
one
insignificant
little
freshman
with
the
courage
of
her
convictions
can
do
something
i
only
ask
you
to
try
your
the
golden
head
dropped
again
and
the
little
clock
ticked
away
minute
after
minute
while
the
soft
light
of
the
fire
wavered
over
two
still
figures
at
last
the
tall
girl
stood
up
i
m
going
to
try
she
said
very
gravely
give
me
your
hand
tia
put
your
fingers
this
way
no
this
way
there
it
would
be
wrong
for
me
to
tell
this
to
anyone
else
in
the
world
outside
of
my
sorority
and
the
girls
might
not
understand
how
it
s
right
for
me
to
tell
even
you
but
that
s
the
sigma
pi
grip
on
our
bargain
chapter
iv
bobs
it
was
the
noon
at
marston
high
and
boys
and
girls
were
crowding
into
the
little
bakery
familiarly
known
among
them
as
the
louise
markham
and
jacquette
had
been
lucky
enough
to
get
a
seat
at
one
of
the
three
tables
but
by
far
the
larger
number
with
their
sandwiches
in
their
hands
were
jostling
for
jacquette
had
decided
that
day
after
a
few
weeks
of
effort
to
take
louise
into
her
confidence
about
the
bargain
with
aunt
sula
and
louise
s
hearty
response
had
been
an
immense
relief
your
aunt
s
exactly
right
she
had
declared
she
s
gone
straight
to
the
weak
points
of
sigma
pi
talk
about
a
sorority
helping
scholarship
the
only
thing
that
has
saved
my
scholarship
at
marston
is
the
fact
that
my
mother
wouldn
t
let
me
go
sigma
pi
until
i
was
a
junior
and
even
since
then
it
has
been
hard
work
to
keep
sorority
business
from
interfering
with
my
school
work
i
believe
any
girl
that
gets
deep
in
sorority
doings
the
first
year
of
high
school
will
have
trouble
straightening
things
out
and
doing
well
with
her
studies
the
rest
of
the
time
and
i
want
you
to
tell
your
aunt
sula
jacquette
that
i
ll
stand
by
and
work
for
every
reform
she
asked
for
i
can
propose
things
being
a
senior
that
the
girls
wouldn
t
take
from
you
and
i
believe
we
can
accomplish
oh
louise
you
re
such
a
splendid
jacquette
began
but
louise
nudged
her
to
be
quiet
two
boys
had
slipped
into
places
which
had
been
vacated
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
and
as
jacquette
looked
up
she
found
herself
gazing
into
the
blue
eyes
of
bobs
drake
bobs
had
scarcely
seated
himself
and
ordered
a
glass
of
milk
from
the
distracted
young
waitress
who
was
answering
wild
calls
for
redhots
and
soup
from
all
directions
at
once
before
the
boys
and
girls
began
to
swarm
about
him
i
hear
you
ve
gone
into
training
now
bobs
just
like
a
varsity
man
began
one
of
the
boys
they
re
telling
around
that
you
live
on
birdseed
and
mush
and
take
long
runs
in
the
early
morning
is
that
right
he
wouldn
t
come
over
to
the
frat
house
last
night
anyway
put
in
lawrence
beach
i
understand
he
s
started
going
to
bed
at
six
then
we
ll
have
to
go
around
and
serenade
him
proposed
rex
morton
we
ll
give
him
oh
does
it
not
seem
hard
to
you
he
hummed
the
first
line
and
the
crowd
of
boys
and
girls
took
it
up
oh
does
it
not
seem
hard
to
you
when
all
the
sky
is
clear
and
blue
and
i
should
like
so
much
to
play
i
have
to
go
to
bed
by
day
they
sang
plaintively
while
bobs
sat
sipping
his
glass
of
milk
with
a
smile
on
his
sunburned
face
as
the
joking
went
on
jacquette
knew
whether
she
looked
at
bobs
or
not
that
his
eyes
were
almost
constantly
on
her
she
wondered
why
it
flattered
and
embarrassed
her
at
the
same
time
and
she
was
glad
and
sorry
when
louise
proposed
to
go
a
moment
later
in
brushing
past
him
on
her
way
out
she
was
astonished
to
have
him
slip
a
folded
note
into
her
hand
louise
he
s
written
something
to
me
she
exclaimed
as
soon
as
they
reached
the
street
let
s
see
what
it
she
unfolded
the
paper
and
together
the
two
girls
read
will
you
let
me
walk
home
with
you
after
school
do
i
know
him
well
enough
say
yes
louise
jacquette
demanded
blanche
gross
introduced
him
to
me
the
day
after
that
indian
performance
and
i
ve
talked
with
him
in
the
halls
some
since
then
but
i
never
dreamed
of
his
giving
me
a
second
thought
when
he
s
so
popular
and
i
m
just
a
freshman
blanche
says
he
has
the
dandiest
morals
of
any
boy
she
knows
what
do
you
think
louise
oh
he
s
nice
i
ve
known
him
all
my
life
and
his
mother
is
one
of
our
best
friends
but
he
s
not
a
beta
sig
and
quis
isn
t
going
to
like
it
if
you
choose
friends
outside
of
his
h
m
quis
doesn
t
own
me
besides
i
have
to
treat
all
fraternities
alike
according
to
the
bargain
with
aunt
sula
jacquette
declared
virtuously
and
immediately
began
to
compose
her
reply
to
bobs
that
reply
consumed
a
large
part
of
the
following
the
momentous
questions
involved
were
first
how
to
begin
second
what
to
say
third
how
to
end
if
bobs
were
any
other
boy
it
would
be
right
to
call
him
but
no
one
in
the
school
said
mr
everyone
said
his
real
name
was
robin
sidney
drake
but
that
was
absurd
for
bobs
besides
he
had
signed
himself
meantime
a
procession
of
aunt
sula
s
admonitions
in
regard
to
writing
notes
to
boys
haunted
jacquette
like
ghosts
and
made
her
tear
up
effort
after
effort
when
the
last
was
finally
completed
it
read
as
follows
bobs
yes
jacquette
she
laid
this
circumspect
epistle
on
bobs
s
desk
as
she
passed
out
of
the
to
her
english
class
and
two
minutes
later
blanche
gross
acting
the
part
of
a
sigma
pi
guardian
came
hurrying
after
and
sitting
down
beside
her
said
reprovingly
you
shouldn
t
write
notes
to
bobs
drake
jacquette
the
minute
you
were
out
of
the
room
he
showed
it
to
rex
morton
and
they
both
let
them
jacquette
returned
flushing
there
was
nothing
in
it
that
the
whole
world
mightn
t
see
that
s
the
only
kind
of
note
i
ever
write
to
boys
and
i
didn
t
learn
the
habit
from
sigma
pi
epsilon
either
then
having
heaped
her
secret
vexation
with
bobs
and
rex
on
the
head
of
blanche
who
was
the
most
prolific
writer
of
notes
in
the
whole
sorority
jacquette
proceeded
to
give
conspicuous
attention
to
her
english
teacher
it
was
an
eventful
moment
when
she
walked
down
the
street
from
marston
with
the
captain
of
the
football
team
at
her
side
and
jacquette
hugely
enjoyed
the
sensation
she
knew
she
was
causing
among
the
girls
then
they
turned
the
corner
and
without
giving
her
time
to
puzzle
longer
bobs
began
abruptly
i
suppose
you
re
wondering
what
i
want
and
i
ll
tell
you
to
begin
that
i
never
would
have
written
you
that
note
if
i
hadn
t
believed
that
you
re
absolutely
if
jacquette
had
heard
herself
called
a
princess
among
women
she
could
not
have
felt
more
pleased
and
her
face
showed
it
of
course
you
know
bobs
continued
that
our
team
has
won
every
game
it
has
played
against
any
other
school
this
fall
i
think
i
do
she
flashed
saucily
and
you
know
that
the
next
game
is
the
last
of
the
season
the
one
that
decides
the
championship
for
the
bobs
cleared
his
throat
and
jacquette
waited
well
of
course
you
know
that
according
to
the
rules
at
marston
if
a
football
man
s
average
for
the
week
falls
below
on
the
day
before
the
game
he
s
debarred
from
playing
you
knew
that
didn
t
you
she
wondered
what
was
coming
the
point
is
this
i
ve
had
a
hard
pull
to
keep
above
in
my
studies
and
keep
the
team
in
shape
too
and
i
haven
t
always
done
it
either
you
probably
know
that
i
missed
playing
in
two
games
this
season
because
i
was
below
those
two
weeks
but
such
marks
as
i
have
had
i
ve
earned
myself
i
haven
t
had
credit
for
a
stroke
of
work
that
was
done
by
anyone
of
course
not
he
looked
at
her
curiously
it
s
a
common
thing
you
know
for
the
fellows
on
the
team
to
have
someone
else
do
their
studying
during
the
season
he
explained
defensively
but
i
ve
stood
against
it
and
they
all
know
it
that
s
the
reason
i
m
in
such
an
awkward
box
now
the
fact
is
i
m
below
in
my
english
this
week
and
besides
all
the
rest
of
the
work
there
are
two
themes
lacking
and
to
make
it
as
bad
as
it
could
be
one
of
those
themes
is
a
sonnet
but
bobs
a
sonnet
that
s
easy
that
s
what
i
ve
heard
about
you
he
answered
hurriedly
they
say
you
can
write
poetry
as
easy
as
breathing
now
you
wouldn
t
believe
it
could
be
done
but
i
ve
managed
all
through
my
high
school
course
to
steer
clear
of
sonnets
i
believe
it
s
a
job
anyway
requiring
so
much
extra
work
this
week
i
have
english
with
miss
breckinridge
you
know
and
she
s
down
on
football
she
thinks
she
can
keep
me
out
of
the
game
by
piling
on
a
sonnet
after
everything
else
well
she
s
cute
i
give
up
i
can
t
write
a
oh
bobs
jacquette
stared
at
him
in
blank
dismay
you
re
captain
you
must
play
in
the
championship
game
then
will
you
write
the
sonnet
jacquette
stood
still
and
met
his
honest
blue
eyes
no
one
who
knew
bobs
could
help
trusting
him
as
far
as
she
could
see
he
was
not
ashamed
of
having
asked
the
question
she
knew
that
it
was
a
common
thing
among
the
girls
to
prepare
lessons
for
their
boy
friends
on
the
team
but
somehow
it
had
never
entered
her
mind
that
she
could
do
such
a
thing
suddenly
the
thought
that
she
jacquette
willard
might
gain
or
lose
bobs
drake
the
chance
to
play
in
the
championship
game
took
away
her
breath
but
it
wouldn
t
be
your
work
bobs
she
uttered
mechanically
while
the
sweet
flattery
of
the
situation
tugged
at
her
principles
what
do
i
care
he
protested
i
m
not
going
to
write
sonnets
for
a
living
i
m
going
to
be
an
engineer
oh
i
know
how
you
feel
about
it
because
my
principles
are
just
the
same
but
this
case
is
an
exception
we
wouldn
t
be
setting
a
bad
example
even
because
no
one
except
you
and
me
need
ever
know
that
s
one
reason
i
asked
you
i
knew
you
d
never
they
had
reached
jacquette
s
home
while
he
was
speaking
and
as
she
glanced
at
an
upper
window
aunt
sula
s
face
leaned
forward
to
smile
a
welcome
oh
bobs
jacquette
cried
reproachfully
then
you
you
thought
i
was
square
i
do
he
answered
stoutly
and
after
that
they
argued
for
a
full
half
hour
standing
there
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
in
the
chill
november
day
the
end
of
it
was
that
bobs
went
away
with
several
new
ideas
about
the
conscience
of
a
girl
not
only
that
he
had
promised
to
burn
the
midnight
oil
before
he
slept
over
a
sonnet
which
was
to
be
addressed
to
past
football
heroes
of
marston
high
whose
ghosts
jacquette
had
hinted
might
be
imagined
as
haunting
the
where
their
banners
still
hung
and
where
the
big
were
always
held
it
would
have
been
far
easier
for
jacquette
to
compose
that
sonnet
on
the
spot
than
it
had
been
to
keep
from
doing
it
and
as
she
entered
the
house
she
was
feeling
triumphant
over
the
way
she
had
insisted
on
bobs
s
working
out
his
own
scheme
then
before
she
had
laid
down
her
books
the
bell
sounded
and
turning
she
saw
her
cousin
marquis
on
the
threshold
come
out
and
walk
around
the
block
with
me
jack
he
demanded
i
want
to
see
you
all
right
quis
she
answered
happily
stopping
to
give
her
grandfather
a
hug
as
he
came
out
of
the
library
to
meet
her
just
sit
down
a
minute
please
while
i
run
upstairs
to
speak
to
tia
then
i
ll
be
votre
but
instead
of
accepting
her
suggestion
marquis
excused
himself
to
his
grandfather
and
went
out
on
the
steps
where
jacquette
found
him
a
little
later
with
clarence
mullen
marquis
had
just
loaded
his
own
on
top
of
those
clarence
already
carried
and
was
giving
a
list
of
orders
in
a
tone
that
a
master
might
use
with
a
slave
after
that
he
was
finishing
as
jacquette
appeared
take
these
books
to
my
house
and
wait
there
till
i
come
no
matter
how
late
it
jacquette
glanced
at
clarence
with
quick
understanding
far
from
seeming
humiliated
he
had
an
air
of
new
importance
as
he
touched
his
hat
to
her
and
hurried
away
so
he
s
pledged
beta
sig
is
he
she
asked
with
a
smile
marquis
nodded
without
speaking
as
they
went
down
the
steps
together
i
ve
a
small
grudge
against
that
boy
because
you
deserted
louise
and
me
to
walk
to
school
with
him
one
morning
jacquette
went
on
lightly
he
s
been
a
rival
of
mine
since
then
every
time
i
want
to
speak
to
you
he
s
right
at
your
heels
i
think
you
have
some
sort
of
fascination
for
him
quis
the
way
he
follows
you
but
of
course
the
fact
that
he
has
a
special
admiration
for
your
cousin
doesn
t
win
him
any
favour
in
your
eyes
quis
said
stiffly
of
course
it
does
in
fact
that
s
the
only
reason
i
haven
t
let
myself
take
a
prejudice
against
him
why
quis
turning
a
surprised
face
to
him
what
s
the
matter
but
marquis
met
her
questioning
look
coldly
i
suppose
you
haven
t
forgotten
that
bobs
drake
is
an
epsilon
lambda
kappa
he
answered
there
was
something
irresistibly
funny
to
jacquette
in
his
solemn
way
of
pronouncing
those
three
greek
letters
especially
as
the
members
of
bobs
s
fraternity
were
universally
known
around
school
as
the
in
spite
of
herself
she
smiled
mischievously
as
she
answered
no
i
haven
t
perhaps
that
doesn
t
mean
anything
to
you
marquis
went
on
severely
noting
the
smile
i
ve
heard
before
that
girls
had
no
sense
of
honour
so
probably
the
fact
that
the
elks
are
recognised
as
good
friends
of
kappa
delta
always
working
to
land
the
best
girls
in
that
sorority
wouldn
t
make
any
difference
to
you
a
sigma
pi
of
course
my
frat
makes
it
a
point
to
help
sigma
pi
and
naturally
it
expects
a
little
appreciation
in
return
but
that
s
not
my
point
now
how
do
you
suppose
it
made
me
feel
to
have
the
other
fellows
in
the
frat
house
just
now
see
you
my
own
cousin
walk
past
with
a
fellow
that
has
treated
me
the
way
bobs
drake
has
quis
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
when
he
was
elected
captain
he
put
ned
woodward
on
the
team
instead
of
me
just
because
i
m
a
beta
sig
and
ned
s
an
elk
yes
he
did
fraternity
prejudice
isn
t
supposed
to
rule
in
the
of
a
football
team
but
it
got
in
its
work
that
time
ned
s
no
better
man
than
i
am
and
most
of
the
fellows
will
tell
you
he
isn
t
as
good
then
bobs
made
me
his
sub
that
means
i
have
no
chance
to
play
ever
unless
he
falls
below
in
his
marks
or
gets
hurt
in
the
game
haven
t
you
caught
on
to
the
fact
that
the
reason
i
could
play
in
those
two
games
early
in
the
season
was
because
bobs
drake
wasn
t
above
those
weeks
do
you
know
that
a
fellow
has
to
play
at
least
two
games
and
a
half
in
order
to
win
his
football
emblem
unless
i
play
another
with
the
team
and
there
s
precious
little
hope
of
it
now
i
won
t
have
a
right
to
wear
the
letters
of
my
school
on
my
sweater
this
but
quis
i
tell
you
bobs
drake
doesn
t
intend
i
shall
have
that
right
he
thinks
i
need
taking
down
because
i
ve
lived
abroad
or
some
such
rot
but
he
s
hurting
himself
all
right
talk
about
his
being
the
idol
of
the
school
you
wouldn
t
think
so
if
you
could
hear
the
fellows
talk
down
at
the
beta
sig
house
they
won
t
get
over
his
slight
to
me
in
a
hurry
and
for
my
part
i
never
shall
you
can
choose
between
bobs
drake
and
me
right
here
and
now
jacquette
you
know
the
facts
are
you
going
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
him
jacquette
hesitated
an
instant
but
that
instant
was
too
much
for
marquis
s
hurt
pride
he
said
something
that
stung
and
she
answered
back
as
sharply
as
she
could
they
went
around
the
block
not
once
but
five
times
before
jacquette
finally
rushed
into
the
house
and
up
to
aunt
sula
s
room
where
she
flung
herself
on
the
couch
in
a
tempest
of
tears
oh
tia
tia
quis
is
dreadfully
angry
at
me
she
sobbed
out
he
has
said
such
awful
things
he
has
even
accused
me
of
coaching
bobs
drake
to
keep
him
above
this
week
so
that
he
can
play
in
the
championship
game
and
keep
quis
out
chapter
v
the
game
this
is
to
certify
that
robin
sidney
drake
is
above
in
all
his
studies
at
marston
high
school
and
qualified
to
enter
the
football
game
on
saturday
november
those
were
the
words
on
the
paper
which
bobs
fluttered
in
jacquette
s
face
when
he
met
her
in
the
hall
between
bells
on
friday
afternoon
the
document
was
signed
by
all
his
teachers
and
at
the
foot
appeared
the
principal
s
name
preceded
by
the
mystic
letters
o
hurrah
she
cried
her
face
pink
with
gladness
in
spite
of
an
uncomfortable
thought
of
marquis
you
did
it
yourself
that
s
the
best
of
it
now
you
may
decide
to
write
sonnets
for
a
living
after
not
much
he
denied
so
fervently
that
jacquette
laughed
how
perfectly
funny
it
looks
to
see
your
name
written
robin
sidney
drake
she
went
on
still
admiring
the
paper
why
isn
t
it
a
nice
name
he
asked
anxiously
bobs
had
always
cherished
a
haunting
doubt
about
the
propriety
of
naming
a
boy
after
a
bird
oh
yes
beautiful
only
nothing
seems
quite
right
for
you
but
all
right
say
it
then
by
the
way
miss
willard
seems
perfectly
funny
to
why
isn
t
it
a
nice
name
she
mocked
oh
yes
beautiful
only
not
quite
right
for
what
is
right
for
me
bobs
hesitated
but
he
knew
what
he
wanted
quis
calls
you
jack
it
came
out
at
last
all
right
say
it
then
they
were
still
laughing
over
this
little
skirmish
when
mademoiselle
passed
them
on
the
way
to
one
of
her
french
classes
coming
to
the
game
mademoiselle
bobs
asked
her
no
lambkin
i
shall
not
come
she
answered
sweetly
i
dearly
love
the
little
boys
who
play
football
but
i
would
so
much
rather
go
to
see
them
in
the
hospital
afterward
bobs
laughed
and
before
he
could
speak
mademoiselle
hurried
along
adding
over
her
shoulder
honey
i
know
just
one
thing
about
the
little
children
who
play
football
sometimes
once
in
a
long
while
they
pass
my
examinations
the
big
fellow
sent
a
smile
of
genuine
liking
after
her
can
t
get
ahead
of
mademoiselle
he
said
but
to
his
surprise
as
he
turned
back
to
jacquette
she
met
him
with
a
serious
almost
rebuking
gaze
bobs
she
said
quis
thinks
there
s
no
excuse
for
a
football
man
s
having
the
reputation
mademoiselle
gave
you
just
now
he
says
a
fellow
can
play
football
and
keep
up
his
studies
too
if
he
tries
hard
enough
he
does
it
he
stands
well
in
everything
and
you
know
he
s
a
good
football
oh
yes
bobs
assented
carelessly
quis
never
has
to
work
on
his
lessons
though
he
just
looks
at
em
most
of
us
have
to
bobs
said
jacquette
with
a
sudden
little
tremble
in
her
voice
can
t
you
couldn
t
you
possibly
bobs
won
t
you
please
manage
somehow
to
put
quis
on
for
the
game
bobs
s
face
was
blank
with
astonishment
what
can
i
do
he
exclaimed
he
s
my
sub
you
know
you
wouldn
t
have
me
deliberately
get
smashed
to
give
him
a
chance
of
course
not
but
quis
is
as
good
as
any
of
the
team
you
know
that
why
couldn
t
you
put
him
on
instead
of
one
of
the
others
the
rest
have
all
played
enough
to
win
their
emblems
haven
t
they
yes
but
see
here
i
can
t
pick
a
fellow
off
the
team
and
put
another
in
his
place
as
if
they
were
so
many
ninepins
they
have
feelings
and
rights
too
a
girl
can
t
understand
i
understand
this
much
she
insisted
her
eyes
filling
with
tears
you
re
the
captain
and
the
boys
think
whatever
you
do
is
right
anyway
and
you
could
manage
it
somehow
i
stood
up
for
you
to
quis
bobs
but
if
you
really
did
keep
him
off
the
team
just
because
he
was
a
beta
sig
and
now
won
t
even
let
him
win
his
emblem
i
can
t
help
thinking
you
haven
t
been
square
it
wasn
t
all
because
he
was
a
beta
sig
bobs
protested
warmly
but
other
things
being
equal
any
fellow
d
give
the
preference
to
his
own
fraternity
quis
would
himself
why
the
beta
sigs
ran
the
team
like
tyrants
last
year
and
this
time
we
thought
the
elks
might
have
a
turn
tisn
t
right
though
i
ve
been
sorry
ever
since
that
i
didn
t
put
quis
on
but
i
can
t
help
it
now
it
s
too
jacquette
listened
unmoved
you
could
do
it
if
you
wanted
to
i
know
you
could
was
all
she
said
as
she
hurried
off
to
her
class
they
had
been
standing
by
the
door
of
an
apparently
empty
recitation
room
but
as
they
turned
away
the
small
dark
face
of
clarence
mullen
peered
at
them
curiously
from
the
doorway
he
had
been
putting
some
work
on
the
blackboard
just
inside
the
room
and
had
heard
every
word
long
before
two
o
clock
the
next
afternoon
twenty
sigma
pi
girls
in
gala
attire
were
seated
in
the
front
row
of
the
grand
stand
waiting
for
the
championship
game
to
begin
just
behind
them
sat
their
rivals
the
kappa
deltas
while
less
important
sororities
each
a
clan
by
itself
were
scattered
through
the
crowd
as
near
to
the
front
as
they
could
find
places
it
was
marston
against
the
daniel
webster
high
school
and
the
contest
would
be
the
closest
of
the
season
gradually
the
seats
filled
until
the
stand
where
the
marston
pupils
sat
and
the
other
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
field
which
was
reserved
for
students
from
webster
high
were
both
packed
at
last
a
gate
at
the
end
of
the
field
swung
open
and
the
webster
team
came
trotting
out
like
one
body
every
person
on
the
webster
grand
stand
was
on
his
feet
and
black
and
red
banners
fluttered
out
from
end
to
end
of
that
mass
of
people
while
boys
and
girls
together
yelled
webster
high
hi
yi
sky
high
webster
flutter
flutter
flutter
said
the
black
and
red
and
the
roaring
from
the
webster
side
waxed
louder
and
louder
as
the
daniel
webster
team
began
its
signal
practice
on
the
field
but
all
this
time
the
marston
stand
remained
a
model
of
dignified
silence
a
little
longer
then
watches
began
to
be
pulled
out
what
was
the
matter
it
was
past
time
for
the
game
to
begin
where
were
the
marstons
at
last
just
as
everyone
was
asking
this
question
the
other
gate
opened
another
team
was
in
the
field
presto
the
marston
grand
stand
was
on
its
feet
blue
and
white
blue
and
white
blue
and
white
rippling
waving
flapping
in
the
november
sunshine
while
the
new
cry
that
rent
the
air
was
osky
wow
wow
skinny
wow
wow
marston
wow
skin
marston
wow
wow
wow
came
back
from
the
websters
in
a
deafening
screech
and
of
all
the
voices
on
both
sides
no
two
were
used
more
vigorously
than
those
of
jacquette
and
louise
who
stood
in
the
front
row
of
the
marston
stand
and
with
all
their
girlish
might
for
the
glory
of
their
school
i
don
t
see
bobs
anywhere
jacquette
whispered
as
she
rested
her
lungs
for
a
minute
i
can
usually
pick
him
out
first
because
he
doesn
t
wear
any
head
guard
and
by
his
white
sweater
too
does
he
wear
a
different
colour
from
the
rest
because
he
s
captain
it
s
lots
more
effective
than
the
blue
ones
the
other
boys
i
know
louise
assented
with
her
eyes
on
the
field
the
blue
m
is
pretty
on
the
white
isn
t
it
sh
look
the
whistle
had
blown
and
the
teams
were
lining
up
for
the
game
people
had
settled
down
into
their
seats
and
were
watching
eagerly
there
s
reddy
go
it
reddy
that
s
shorty
look
at
ned
come
on
chub
were
the
explosive
cries
that
had
taken
the
place
of
continuous
yelling
as
the
game
began
then
attention
jacquette
clutched
louise
s
hand
bobs
isn
t
there
who
s
it
s
quis
quis
it
was
running
the
team
in
bobs
s
place
what
did
it
mean
where
was
bobs
but
the
game
had
started
forward
and
back
forward
and
back
forward
and
back
struggled
the
two
teams
now
on
marston
territory
now
almost
to
the
daniel
webster
goal
two
more
evenly
matched
schools
it
would
have
been
hard
to
find
each
had
behind
it
that
season
an
unbroken
series
of
triumphs
to
both
of
them
this
game
meant
more
than
the
mere
winning
of
the
championship
banner
it
meant
the
overcoming
of
a
hated
rival
where
was
bobs
drake
that
question
was
the
undercurrent
of
all
the
perfunctory
cheering
on
the
marston
stand
and
with
jacquette
it
swept
away
every
other
thought
it
s
my
fault
she
kept
repeating
in
a
horrified
tone
to
louise
it
s
all
my
fault
look
we
re
losing
ground
we
are
louise
i
made
him
let
quis
play
if
marston
s
beaten
it
s
all
my
fault
nonsense
louise
insisted
do
you
think
bobs
drake
would
desert
the
team
because
a
girl
told
him
to
there
s
some
other
reason
but
look
oh
no
one
ever
knew
just
what
happened
two
minutes
of
play
were
left
there
was
a
weak
spot
somewhere
in
the
marston
line
a
trick
play
a
wildly
struggling
mass
then
a
form
the
webster
pursued
in
vain
by
the
best
men
on
the
marston
team
shot
across
the
field
and
fell
exhausted
with
the
ball
in
his
arms
just
over
the
marston
line
an
attempt
to
kick
goal
failed
time
was
called
the
first
half
was
done
the
score
stood
five
to
nothing
in
favor
of
webster
high
the
webster
yelling
was
terrific
as
the
tangle
of
human
beings
began
to
resolve
itself
into
individuals
and
clear
the
field
but
among
the
marstons
arose
a
great
buzz
of
anxious
questioning
where
was
bobs
what
had
become
of
their
captain
louise
was
trying
to
keep
jacquette
in
her
place
until
they
could
get
some
news
but
i
can
t
sit
here
and
wait
jacquette
refused
excitedly
i
must
find
somebody
and
do
something
well
i
m
going
with
you
then
louise
gave
up
at
last
keep
our
places
girls
she
called
to
the
rest
of
the
sigma
pi
crowd
as
she
followed
jacquette
now
what
can
you
do
she
demanded
as
she
overtook
her
a
girl
can
t
go
to
training
i
don
t
know
can
t
i
send
a
message
to
bobs
some
way
there
goes
bud
banister
he
s
manager
of
the
team
cried
louise
bud
bud
tell
us
what
s
the
matter
matter
enough
the
tall
lanky
fellow
flung
back
angrily
as
he
ran
past
bobs
went
off
on
the
two
o
clock
train
and
sent
us
word
to
go
on
with
the
game
without
him
i
told
you
louise
jacquette
gasped
bud
wait
she
called
miss
willard
look
here
put
in
a
breathless
voice
at
jacquette
s
elbow
and
turning
she
saw
clarence
mullen
his
small
dark
face
the
sickly
colour
of
fear
what
shall
i
do
he
demanded
as
if
consulting
a
confidante
i
told
em
he
went
but
it
wasn
t
so
i
ve
got
him
locked
in
the
gymnasium
over
at
school
but
i
can
t
let
him
out
for
the
next
half
even
if
i
want
to
because
the
janitor
came
out
of
the
building
when
i
did
and
he
locked
the
outside
door
and
i
haven
t
got
a
key
to
that
jacquette
whirled
around
and
towered
above
the
boy
s
shrinking
figure
what
are
you
saying
she
cried
out
seizing
him
by
both
shoulders
in
her
excitement
you
locked
bobs
in
the
gymnasium
yes
he
faltered
under
her
wrathful
glance
i
i
heard
you
talking
to
him
yesterday
and
i
i
knew
the
beta
sigs
all
thought
it
was
dirty
work
that
granville
couldn
t
win
his
emblem
and
i
had
the
chance
he
was
late
and
he
ran
down
to
the
gym
alone
to
change
his
clothes
and
left
the
key
in
the
outside
of
the
door
and
while
he
was
at
his
locker
i
shut
it
and
turned
the
key
and
then
the
janitor
came
away
when
i
did
so
there
was
no
one
to
hear
him
and
i
told
i
believe
it
s
true
louise
broke
in
there
goes
mr
branch
now
with
bud
banister
we
must
tell
them
quick
the
principal
of
marston
turned
in
surprise
as
the
girls
followed
by
clarence
dashed
up
behind
him
but
before
their
jumble
of
explanation
was
done
he
started
for
the
school
racing
like
a
boy
with
bud
banister
mr
branch
had
a
key
to
the
building
and
as
they
came
near
they
heard
shouting
and
pounding
and
saw
bobs
s
flushed
face
looking
out
through
the
basement
windows
of
the
gymnasium
everybody
in
the
block
has
gone
to
the
game
bud
panted
or
someone
would
have
heard
him
sure
it
was
the
work
of
one
excited
moment
to
set
bobs
free
and
no
time
was
wasted
in
words
the
case
of
clarence
mullen
could
wait
the
game
would
not
all
bobs
asked
was
how
the
score
stood
and
whether
the
second
half
had
begun
and
even
this
information
he
took
on
the
run
not
one
of
them
could
keep
up
with
him
on
the
way
back
to
the
field
bud
banister
was
at
his
heels
jacquette
and
louise
trailed
after
and
last
of
all
came
mr
branch
with
a
stern
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
clarence
mullen
questioning
him
sharply
as
they
hurried
along
the
sigma
pi
girls
on
the
grand
stand
received
louise
and
jacquette
in
a
flutter
of
curiosity
for
only
stray
rumours
of
bobs
s
desertion
had
been
passed
along
to
them
but
before
there
was
time
for
explanation
the
whistle
blew
and
all
eyes
turned
to
the
field
then
a
shout
went
up
bigger
and
wilder
than
any
shout
that
had
gone
before
bobs
drake
was
there
marston
was
safe
as
the
teams
faced
each
other
just
before
he
took
his
place
as
quarterback
bobs
had
passed
along
the
line
murmuring
a
personal
word
of
encouragement
to
each
of
the
boys
up
to
that
instant
they
had
been
parts
of
a
machine
now
they
crouched
there
every
man
of
them
ready
to
play
that
game
with
his
head
his
heart
and
his
whole
soul
on
the
grand
stand
where
the
sigma
pi
girls
were
sitting
a
quick
glance
of
intelligence
ran
along
webster
never
would
have
made
that
touchdown
if
bobs
had
been
here
was
whispered
from
one
to
the
other
that
s
not
fair
louise
murmured
to
jacquette
i
m
not
saying
anything
against
bobs
but
my
brother
says
there
isn
t
a
better
quarterback
on
a
high
school
team
anywhere
than
meanwhile
down
in
the
field
the
struggle
of
the
first
half
was
being
repeated
marston
was
reinforced
by
bobs
s
presence
but
webster
played
with
the
confidence
born
of
success
and
again
each
fought
an
obstinate
foe
if
systematic
cheering
could
have
won
the
game
marston
would
have
had
it
over
and
over
the
grand
stand
rose
to
its
feet
and
shouted
as
one
man
such
heartening
yells
as
harum
scarum
wah
whoo
hear
us
cheer
us
white
and
blue
we
play
football
that
s
no
joke
marston
high
school
hic
haec
hoc
down
below
captain
bobs
drake
dimly
conscious
of
the
support
the
school
was
giving
him
seemed
by
sheer
force
of
will
to
be
driving
his
team
toward
the
far
white
goal
line
which
meant
victory
the
score
still
remained
as
at
the
end
of
the
first
half
as
the
close
of
the
game
approached
he
realised
almost
with
desperation
that
no
combined
effort
on
the
part
of
the
team
could
break
down
the
defence
which
confronted
it
he
bobs
drake
must
win
that
game
seven
rahs
for
the
team
roared
the
man
who
was
directing
the
cheering
from
the
marston
stand
and
rah
rah
rah
rah
rah
rah
rah
bobs
was
exploded
on
the
air
but
bobs
heard
none
of
it
at
that
moment
a
fumble
on
the
part
of
one
of
his
men
had
placed
the
ball
at
his
feet
and
like
a
flash
with
the
in
his
arms
he
had
broken
loose
hurdled
a
crouching
player
flung
two
more
out
of
his
path
and
gained
the
line
five
to
five
said
the
score
marston
s
one
chance
of
winning
depended
now
on
bobs
s
ability
to
gain
an
extra
point
by
kicking
the
ball
over
the
between
the
there
was
a
moment
of
breathless
suspense
then
the
ball
sailed
proudly
over
the
bar
time
was
called
and
the
marston
crowd
went
wild
the
game
was
won
the
marston
stand
emptied
itself
like
an
avalanche
into
the
narrow
space
between
it
and
the
field
the
wonder
was
that
everyone
got
down
alive
for
the
leaping
and
scrambling
and
pushing
were
terrific
everyone
wanted
to
be
first
at
the
gate
where
the
team
was
coming
out
on
its
way
back
to
from
their
seat
in
the
front
row
the
sigma
pi
girls
had
best
chance
and
jacquette
and
louise
stood
close
to
the
entrance
as
the
triumphal
procession
appeared
first
came
bobs
proudly
borne
aloft
by
four
of
his
team
there
was
mud
on
his
forehead
mud
on
one
cheek
and
a
long
scratch
on
the
other
but
he
was
a
hero
every
inch
in
the
hearts
of
his
comrades
and
the
ovation
they
gave
him
proved
it
close
behind
him
rode
quis
granville
and
after
him
the
rest
of
the
eleven
each
lifted
on
the
shoulders
of
three
or
four
fellows
when
they
had
all
tramped
by
the
crowd
of
schoolboys
that
always
straggles
after
the
team
fell
into
line
behind
them
and
the
sigma
pi
girls
began
to
chatter
what
will
they
do
to
that
wicked
little
clarence
mullen
blanche
gross
demanded
she
had
been
gleaning
the
facts
from
louise
and
passing
them
on
he
ll
surely
be
expelled
i
don
t
know
but
i
could
forgive
him
after
that
victory
put
in
mamie
coolidge
who
had
been
screaming
and
jumping
up
and
down
until
her
new
red
velvet
hat
was
flopping
wildly
over
one
ear
jacquette
willard
you
tell
your
cousin
for
me
that
i
never
saw
such
a
tackle
as

all
my
life

in
soulfully
didn
t
he
look
happy
when
they
carried
him
by
he
saw
us

t
you
think
so
he
looked
straight
at
you
jacquette
louise
whispered
i
know
it
she
whispered
back
and
i
was
so
busy
waving
to
him
that
i
never
even
saw
quis
until
he
was
away
past
chapter
vi
the
there

jacquette
holding
up
a
huge
yellow
chrysanthemum
that
she
had
just
finished
would
anyone
guess
it
was
paper
that
s
my
fiftieth
and
i
must
a
committee
of
sigma

girls
had
met
that
afternoon
in
the
sorority
rooms

were
on

third
floor
of

house

work
on

and
yards

a
duplicate
of

flower
above
her
head
don
t
go
jacquette
she
added
as
a
maid
appeared
with
a
tray
there
are
signs
of
hot
chocolate
on
the
horizon
besides
we
faithfuls
may
have
to
do
more
than
fifty
apiece
unless
the
rest
of
the
girls
come
to
time
we
must
have
a
thousand
chrysanthemums
you
know
or
it
won
t
make
any
show
at
oh
well
i
can
t
resist
the
chocolate
jacquette
yielded
sitting
down
again
but
i
must
skip
right
after
that
truth
is
there
s
been
so
much
to
do
about
the
dance
that
i
ve
scarcely
looked
at
a
lesson
for
a
week
and
i
simply
must
get
in
a
little
studying
before
my
algebra
exam
what
a
nuisance
to
have
exams
the
week
of
the
dance
mamie
coolidge
sympathised
as
the
chocolate
was
being
handed
around
oh
by
the
way
jacquette
what
about
your
carriage
for
the
dance
i
heard
your
aunt
wouldn
t
let
you
have
what
going
to
a
formal
dance
without
a
carriage
cried
etta
brainerd
in
a
scandalised
tone
jacquette
you
poor
girl
jacquette
flushed
pity
s
wasted
etta
she
answered
rather
curtly
i
expect
to
have
a
but
since
when
mamie
persisted
flo
burton
told
me
you
couldn
if
you
want
the
whole
story
it
s
this
said
jacquette
at
first
aunt
sula
didn
t
like
my
asking
a
boy
to
take
me
to
the
dance
but
when
she
found
it
was
the
sorority
way
she
let
me
invite
bobs
then
when
she
found
that
he
was
expected
to
pay
for
a
carriage
she
did
suggest
that
i
do
without
one
you
see
she
supposed
because
we
re
young
the
whole
thing
would
be
simple
early
hours
and
all
that
but
when
i
told
her
how
it
really
was
she
said
she
was
going
to
hire
the
carriage
for
me
herself
and
that
i
should
invite
louise
and
bud
banister
to
go
in
it
with
bobs
and
me
so
i
and
a
lovely
plan
i
call
it
louise
chimed
in
you
d
have
laughed
to
see
the
look
of
relief
on
bud
s
face
when
i
told
him
it
isn
t
so
easy
for
him
to
get
money
from
his
father
i
guess
you
know
girls
it
is
a
sort
of
the
way
we
invite
the
boys
and
expect
them
to
furnish
oh
i
don
t
know
mamie
objected
while
she
dropped
another
lump
of
sugar
in
her
chocolate
they
get
a
chance
to
come
to
a
dance
that
costs
us
nearly
three
hundred
dollars
my
mother
thought
that
was
terribly
extravagant
until
i
told
her
how
much
worse
some
other
sororities
are
did
you
know
the
omikron
gammas
had
to
put
up
twenty
dollars
apiece
for
their
dance
besides
the
regular
dues
i
say
it
s
pretty
creditable
to
sigma
pi
that
we
draw
all
our
funds
out
of
the
bank
and
give
our
dance
without
any
extra
taxing
when
we
may
be
needing
that
money
any
time
to
fight
the
board
of
education
with
illustration
are
signs
of
hot
chocolate
on
the
horizon
everybody
except
mamie
laughed
she
was
the
spoiled
child
of
sigma
pi
and
when
she
lifted
her
doll
face
to
make
a
remark
it
was
always
the
signal
for
indulgent
smiles
i
wouldn
t
say
that
outside
mame
blanche
advised
it
might
not
sound
well
to
the
school
it
s
true
just
the
same
didn
t
sigma
pi
have
to
give
a
hundred
dollars
to
the
league
last
year
when
we
got
the
injunction
to
keep
the
board
from
enforcing
that
rule
against
secret
societies
and
if
the
board
makes
any
more
silly
old
rules
the
boys
say
we
ll
have
to
get
a
good
lawyer
and
fight
the
thing
to
a
just
think
what
if
they
should
ever
succeed
in
shutting
secret
societies
out
of
high
school
altogether
louise
suggested
they
never
can
we
re
too
powerful
for
them
blanche
said
decidedly
the
only
result
would
be
that
we
d
have
to
work
in
the
well
in
the
meantime
yours
truly
is
going
home
to
study

put
in
setting
down
her
cup

chocolate
blanche
she
added
as
she
stepped
gingerly
over
the
billows
of
tissue
paper
that
covered
the
floor
wait
for
me
jack
called
louise
i
ve
made
sixty
chrysanthemums
that
s
ten
more
than
my
share
and
i
m
needed
at
home
myself
mother
isn
t
well
pretty
sorority
spirit
you
girls
show
etta
grumbled
as
she
began
crimping
yellow
petals
again
you
might
stay
and
help
the
rest
of
us
even
if
you
did
get
yours
done
no
one
echoed
etta
but
there
was
a
subdued
manner
about
the
farewells
that
seemed
to
give
consent
to
her
feeling
and
as
the
two
girls
walked
down
the
street
together
jacquette
said
louise
sometimes
it
seems
as
if
i
couldn
t
do
enough
for
sigma
pi
to
suit
the
girls
they
call
me
a
traitor
every
time
i
speak
of
having
to
study
or
to
do
anything
at
home
and
truly
i
m
so
rushed
that
i
can
t
get
time
to
mend
my
own
stockings
there
s
sorority
business
on
hand
from
morning
till
i
know
all
you
can
do
is
to
hang
on
to
your
own
judgment
and
not
let
the
girls
put
too
much
on
you
they
count
on
the
freshmen
being
flattered
at
the
chance
of
doing
most
of
the
work
you
know
there
goes
quis
around
that
corner
jacquette
by
the
way
i
was
glad
to
see
you
were
on
speaking
terms
with
him
this
yes
we
had
to
make
it
up
after
a
fashion
but
oh
how
angry
he
is
with
clarence
mullen
i
don
t
wonder
at
no
i
don
t
he
s
afraid
people
may
think
he
knew
what
clarence
was
going
to
do
so
he
s
making
his
disapproval
as
public
as
he
can
of
course
he
won
t
let
clarence
into
beta
sig
now
and
he
d
like
to
have
him
expelled
from
school
but
mr
branch
takes
the
ground
that
clarence
is
less
to
blame
than
the
big
boys
that
talked
all
this
feeling
into
him
if
that
s
so
i
m
partly
responsible
too
he
overheard
me
talking
to
bobs
about
it
and
that
influenced
him
you
but
that
s
no
excuse
for
what
he
did
no
mr
branch
doesn
t
excuse
him
but
he
says
clarence
is
so
much
younger
and
so
easily
influenced
that
he
s
like
one
of
these
anarchists
that
get
all
inflamed
by
speeches
they
ve
heard
and
things
they
ve
read
and
imagine
they
re
doing
a
heroic
act
when
they
go
and
shoot
the
president
you
ought
to
have
heard
him
lecture
the
beta
sig
fellows
in
the
talk
he
gave
yesterday
he
says
clarence
actually
expected
they
would
applaud
him
and
that
it
reflects
great
discredit
on
well
there
s
something
in
that
isn
t
there
but
if
i
were
clarence
i
d
sooner
be
expelled
than
come
back
to
marston
and
face
the
feeling
there
he
s
not
coming
back
his
father
is
going
to
send
him
to
military
school
louise
did
you
know
that
bobs
went
to
mr
branch
and
told
him
that
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
he
hoped
clarence
would
get
another
chance
no
what
did
quis
think
of
that
oh
quis
doesn
t
like
anything
bobs
does
here
he
s
won
his
emblem
but
he
says
it
s
no
thanks
to
bobs
that
he
never
would
have
got
it
if
bobs
hadn
t
been
locked
up
i
wish
you
d
talk
to
him
he
s
so
jealous
of
my
liking
any
boy
outside
of
his
frat
this
morning
he
accused
me
of
getting
the
girls
to
give
our
dance
on
the
same
night
the
beta
sigs
have
theirs
so
that
he
d
be
tied
up
for
that
evening
and
i
could
feel
free
to
ask
bobs
foolishness
he
doesn
t
know
it
s
foolishness
though
louise
jacquette
lowered
her
voice
as
if
she
knew
she
were
uttering
heresy
with
quis
acting
this
way
and
the
sigma
pi
girls
calling
me
disloyal
every
time
i
look
at
an
old
friend
like
margaret
howland
i
sometimes
wish
there
were
no
such
thing
as
a
fraternity
or
sorority
in
school
louise
turned
and
looked
at
the
tired
flushed
face
that
s
a
mood
honey
she
answered
sagely
i
ve
had
it
myself
but
it
comes
back
to
this
every
time
as
long
as
there
are
sororities
we
want
to
be
in
them
how
would
you
like
to
go
to
a
dance
and
be
told
that
because
you
were
a
girl
you
must
stay
in
one
end
of
the
hall
and
not
dance
beyond
a
certain
imaginary
line
on
the
floor
they
wouldn
t
do
it
in
some
schools
they
do
not
here
because
girls
aren
t
invited
do
you
know
what
would
happen
if
you
had
asked
a
fellow
to
the
dance
you
d
dance
with
him
and
not
another
soul
all
the
evening
tisn
t
fair
of
course
but
we
can
t
reform
the
world
all
at
once
so
you
d
better
comfort
yourself
thinking
how
lovely
you
re
going
to
look
in
that
new
gown
you
ll
be
in
sorority
colours
won
t
you
your
hair
the
gold
and
your
dress
the
jacquette
smiled
through
her
mood
at
the
thought
i
can
hardly
wait
for
friday
she
confessed
as
they
parted
at
the
corner
but
louise
you
try
to
talk
a
little
sense
into
quis
for
me
won
t
you
perhaps
he
ll
listen
to
you
he
thinks
you
re
the
whole
you
mean
he
used
to
think
so
before
a
certain
miss
willard
came
to
town
was
the
mischievous
answer
yes
i
ll
do
what
i
can
the
week
moved
slowly
along
and
the
friday
of
the
sigma
pi
dance
had
come
that
morning
in
every
classroom
at
marston
appeared
the
blackboard
announcement
that
a
would
be
held
in
the
assembly
room
directly
after
school
for
the
presentation
of
football
emblems
to
the
team
marston
assembly
hall
was
shaped
like
a
great
low
and
ceiled
everywhere
with
varnished
yellow
pine
seats
lined
the
curved
sides
of
the
room
running
down
in
steep
tiers
which
left
only
a
narrow
floor
space
in
front
and
from
windows
behind
these
seats
that
afternoon
the
sunlight
streamed
down
into
the
faces
of
twelve
heroes
who
sat
in
a
stiff
row
of
chairs
their
backs
against
the
yellow
wall
facing
the
audience
above
their
heads
plastered
all
over
the
one
straight
side
of
the
room
hung
the
purple
red
blue
gold
and
white
banners
which
had
been
won
by
marston
in
former
victories
and
on
the
piano
which
stood
wedged
in
between
the
front
row
of
seats
and
the
wall
rose
a
stack
of
each
containing
as
everyone
knew
a
handsome
dark
blue
sweater
with
the
white
letters
m
emblazoned
on
its
front
suddenly
the
boys
and
girls
who
were
not
only
packed
into
seats
but
standing
on
every
available
inch
in
the
room
began
to
cheer
tippie
mcgee
the
marston
mascot
a
little
gamin
from
nobody
knew
where
who
was
always
on
hand
for
the
marston
games
had
been
perched
on
a
chair
by
the
piano
and
bud
banister
as
manager
of
the
team
was
announcing
an
original
song
composed
for
the
occasion
by
our
mascot
tippie
without
whom
we
probably
never
could
have
beaten
webster
the
school
will
please
join
in
the
second
all
along
the
low
step
in
front
of
the
first
tier
of
seats
only
a
few
feet
from
the
football
heroes
whom
they
faced
sat
the
smiling
sigma
pi
girls
and
it
was
into
their
eyes
that
tippie
looked
as
he
began
singing
shrilly
to
the
tune
of
the
good
old
in
the
good
old
football
time
in
the
good
old
football
time
strolling
down
by
marston
field
you
ll
see
us
buck
the
line
our
captain
kicks
a
goal
from
field
and
that
s
a
very
good
sign
that
marston
s
got
the
championship
in
the
good
old
football
time
that
was
all
but
patti
in
her
palmiest
days
might
have
envied
tippie
the
warmth
of
his
reception
shrieks
whistles
applause
with
hands
and
feet
cries
of
good
good
for
tippie
choked
the
air
and
it
was
long
before
the
crowd
could
calm
itself
to
join
uproariously
in
the
second
singing
once
started
though
it
could
not
stop
the
second
singing
was
followed
by
a
third
the
third
by
a
fourth
then
the
presentation
captain
robin
sidney
drake
was
the
first
name
called
bobs
arrayed
in
his
best
black
suit
stepped
forward
amid
a
tremendous
burst
of
cheering
and
listened
uncomfortably
to
branch
s
eulogy
on
his
captainship
of
the
marston
eleven
but
when
the
box
containing
the
precious
sweater
was
handed
to
him
his
face
beamed
clasping
it
tenderly
as
one
holds
a
baby
he
stood
smiling
down
at
it
for
a
minute
before
he
lifted
his
blue
eyes
to
the
principal
s
face
then
his
lips
parted
and
everyone
leaned
forward
to
listen
it
s
a
pretty
big
box
said
bobs
and
no
eloquence
could
have
pleased
his
adoring
schoolmates
better
they
screamed
with
mirth
they
laughed
until
they
cried
they
hooted
with
glee
they
hurrahed
for
bobs
not
until
he
swung
around
and
faced
them
with
a
determined
air
of
getting
ready
for
a
speech
did
they
subside
then
bobs
still
hugging
the
big
box
threw
back
his
head
and
addressed
the
galleries
which
did
not
exist
thank
you
he
said
just
that
not
another
word
but
his
eyes
deserted
the
imaginary
galleries
and
with
his
own
merry
smile
he
looked
straight
into
the
faces
of
the
boys
and
girls
who
loved
him
after
that
he
sat
down
cheer
of
course
they
cheered
what
if
he
couldn
t
make
a
speech
he
was
bobs
at
last
bud
s
voice
was
heard
announcing
the
popular
song
entitled
old
then
tippie
standing
on
the
chair
by
the
old
piano
which
was
tinkling
out
the
tune
of
tammany
led
off
hold
hem
haitch
hold
hem
haitch
beat
our
captain
if
you
can
we
ll
defend
him
to
a
man
hold
hem
haitch
etc
the
more
enthusiastic
tippie
grew
the
more
he
aspirated
his
vowels
always
and
the
school
seeking
an
outlet
for
feelings
seized
on
his
hold
hem
haitch
hold
hem
haitch
they
all
shouted
together
and
not
one
more
fervently
than
jacquette
who
from
the
row
of
sigma
pi
girls
smiled
straight
into
bobs
s
face
as
she
sang
beat
our
captain
if
you
can
we
ll
defend
him
to
a
man
then
suddenly
she
felt
quis
looking
coldly
at
her
and
in
spite
of
all
she
could
do
her
voice
weakened
and
her
eyes
fell
a
cloud
had
come
over
her
gladness
the
meeting
went
on
one
after
another
the
members
of
the
team
stood
up
received
their
sweaters
acknowledged
them
properly
were
duly
cheered
and
sat
down
marquis
was
last
the
only
substitute
to
win
an
m
that
year
and
his
little
speech
of
appreciation
as
mr
branch
handed
him
the
box
was
perfectly
turned
jacquette
was
proud
of
his
appearance
but
she
felt
through
and
through
the
contrast
between
his
reception
and
the
one
given
to
bobs
marquis
was
admired
bobs
was
loved
as
the
broke
up
with
the
boys
all
crowding
around
their
captain
she
realised
with
a
sense
of
girlish
elation
that
she
jacquette
willard
was
going
to
her
first
dance
that
night
with
the
hero
of
marston
high
from
that
moment
until
the
evening
was
done
she
forgot
marquis
s
displeasure
and
lived
in
a
fairy
tale
her
feet
scarcely
staid
on
the
floor
while
she
dressed
for
the
dance
the
filmy
blue
gown
the
white
slippers
the
long
white
gloves
even
the
sparkle
of
her
own
eyes
and
the
glint
of
gold
in
her
hair
as
she
saw
herself
in
the
mirror
all
seemed
new
and
bewitching
tia
tia
am
i
really
that
girl
in
the
glass
or
is
she
a
dream
she
cried
the
roses
deepening
in
her
cheeks
as
she
caught
her
little
aunt
in
her
arms
just
before
she
started
then
she
found
herself
leaning
back
against
the
cushions
of
the
carriage
and
she
turned
a
wondering
glance
on
louise
who
sat
beside
her
uttering
commonplaces
to
bobs
and
ned
as
if
this
were
everyday
life
after
all
a
girl
needed
to
have
grown
up
in
brookdale
jacquette
reflected
to
understand
the
thrill
of
grandeur
she
had
felt
when
that
carriage
door
slammed
she
had
the
same
thought
again
a
little
later
when
they
all
stepped
out
into
the
carpeted
covered
way
that
led
from
the
carriage
to
the
entrance
of
the
lakeside
club
and
while
she
was
thinking
it
she
entered
into
a
fairyland
of
lights
of
music
of
gaiety
of
excitement
chapter
vii
the
as
soon
as
jacquette
opened
her
eyes
next
morning
she
closed
them
again
and
tried
to
bring
back
the
glittering
scene
of
the
evening
before
bobs
had
proved
a
perfect
cavalier
as
good
a
dancer
as
quarterback
and
two
o
clock
had
come
before
anyone
remembered
time
yes
she
could
see
the
brilliant
hall
the
blue
and
gold
decorations
the
huge
copy
of
the
sigma
pi
pin
done
in
electric
lights
on
the
wall
just
over
the
orchestra
the
richly
dressed
mothers
of
two
of
the
girls
presiding
at
frappé
as
chaperones
of
the
occasion
she
even
heard
strains
of
music
and
carriage
numbers
being
called
as
they
came
out
into
the
frosty
air
but
all
the
time
she
knew
that
it
was
past
and
that
nothing
was
left
to
happen
for
weeks
she
had
been
looking
forward
to
this
dance
now
that
it
was
over
the
year
stretched
ahead
in
grey
monotony
after
a
few
days
however
she
awoke
to
the
fact
that
another
event
fully
as
exciting
though
very
different
in
nature
was
looming
in
the
near
future
two
of
her
teachers
warned
her
that
she
would
have
to
do
better
work
if
she
hoped
to
get
through
her
examinations
in
january
jacquette
heard
them
in
shocked
astonishment
in
brookdale
she
had
been
the
star
of
all
her
classes
it
seemed
unbelievable
that
she
could
be
facing
utter
failure
yet
the
examinations
she
knew
counted
as
much
in
the
year
s
standing
as
the
dreaded
june
finals
themselves
as
she
started
for
home
that
day
she
was
wondering
with
a
sick
dread
how
tia
would
feel
when
she
told
her
and
whether
if
she
really
should
fail
the
sigma
pi
girls
would
carry
out
that
dreadful
threat
of
taking
away
her
pin
at
least
she
made
up
her
mind
if
hard
study
from
now
on
could
avert
the
calamity
it
should
never
come
and
she
began
her
campaign
by
resolutely
refusing
to
join
in
a
special
frolic
which
was
coming
off
in
the
sorority
rooms
that
afternoon
her
grandfather
and
aunt
sula
were
both
out
when
she
reached
home
so
jacquette
had
the
library
to
herself
and
she
set
at
work
with
a
will
half
an
hour
passed
then
she
saw
rodney
fletcher
a
grammar
school
boy
dashing
across
the
street
to
her
door
give
me
shelter
miss
willard
he
asked
breathlessly
you
know
i
m
coming
up
to
high
school
in
february
and
the
beta
sigs
and
the
elks
are
both
trying
to
pledge
me
now
so
as
to
be
sure
of
me
when
i
get
there
the
elks
are
bound
to
clinch
the
thing
but
i
don
t
want
to
give
them
an
answer
till
i
see
what
the
beta
sigs
are
going
to
do
and
they
ve
asked
me
down
to
their
frat
house
i
ve
skipped
out
so
my
mother
can
tell
the
elk
boys
i
m
not
at
home
oh
look
they
re
coming
over
here
hide
me
somewhere
while
he
was
speaking
jacquette
entering
into
the
fun
had
hurried
him
into
the
and
had
drawn
the
heavy
curtains
don
t
give
me
away
now
on
your
honour
was
his
parting
injunction
as
she
turned
to
admit
the
delegation
of
elks
but
the
whole
affair
took
a
different
colour
a
minute
later
when
the
first
elk
to
walk
in
was
bobs
drake
playing
a
joke
on
bobs
was
the
last
thing
she
had
thought
of
she
had
never
before
known
him
to
take
an
active
part
in
fraternity
contentions
yet
here
he
was
and
there
in
the
was
rodney
trusting
her
to
keep
him
hidden
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
carry
it
through
and
explain
to
bobs
afterward
we
just
stopped
to
ask
if
you
d
seen
rod
fletcher
he
was
saying
as
she
reached
this
decision
why
yes
he
was
here
a
little
while
ago
she
answered
cautiously
we
can
t
get
track
of
him
put
in
another
boy
his
mother
says
she
doesn
t
know
where
he
does
she
well
he
isn
t
at
home
then
fletcher
would
tell
you
if
he
were
jacquette
assured
them
beginning
to
enjoy
the
joke
for
its
own
sake
and
feeling
certain
that
bobs
was
going
to
understand
later
on
we
won
t
stay
i
see
you
re
studying
bobs
said
considerately
but
we
d
appreciate
it
if
you
d
put
in
a
good
word
for
the
elks
with
rodney
we
don
t
want
the
beta
sigs
to
get
him
because
he
s
worth
i
m
sorry
bobs
she
answered
decidedly
but
i
ve
promised
aunt
sula
that
i
won
t
take
sides
with
any
fraternity
besides
i
doubt
if
rodney
would
be
influenced
by
anything
i
could
she
had
followed
the
boys
to
the
door
while
she
spoke
and
as
they
went
down
the
walk
she
heard
them
rallying
bobs
on
his
failure
to
secure
her
as
an
ally
that
bothered
her
and
she
found
it
hard
to
get
back
into
the
spirit
of
study
after
rodney
had
gone
next
morning
at
school
the
first
thing
she
heard
was
that
the
beta
sigmas
had
pledged
rodney
at
their
fraternity
house
the
night
before
and
this
coupled
with
the
disturbing
fact
that
bobs
was
missing
from
school
altogether
for
the
next
three
days
had
a
demoralising
effect
on
jacquette
s
good
resolutions
about
work
on
the
fourth
morning
she
stopped
louise
in
the
hall
between
bells
to
say
wait
a
minute
louise
tell
me
what
you
know
about
bobs
i
saw
him
going
upstairs
just
now
but
he
wouldn
t
give
me
a
chance
to
speak
to
him
even
and
i
don
t
understand
why
is
it
true
that
he
s
not
coming
back
to
school
there
had
been
disturbing
rumours
about
bobs
he
was
quoted
as
having
said
that
there
was
no
special
object
in
finishing
his
senior
year
now
that
the
football
season
was
over
with
his
record
as
quarterback
to
help
him
the
boys
said
he
could
easily
get
into
college
on
the
work
he
had
already
done
yet
now
on
the
day
before
the
christmas
vacation
he
had
appeared
again
and
seemed
to
be
attending
his
classes
as
usual
hush
louise
answered
something
dreadful
happened
in
chemistry
class
and
bobs
has
gone
to
the
office
now
i
can
t
stop
but
i
ll
tell
you
all
about
it
at
gone
to
the
office
meant
an
interview
with
the
principal
and
all
through
her
french
recitation
jacquette
was
wondering
what
bobs
could
have
done
over
and
over
again
mademoiselle
s
searching
eyes
and
sudden
questions
brought
her
back
to
the
subject
but
when
the
bell
finally
rang
the
amount
of
french
she
had
absorbed
was
very
slight
then
she
and
louise
flew
together
like
magnet
and
needle
never
mind
luncheon
said
jacquette
let
s
walk
down
the
street
where
we
can
be
alone
now
tell
me
twas
just
this
louise
began
obediently
some
of
the
boys
have
been
getting
up
an
illustrated
magazine
called
the
just
one
copy
you
know
on
fine
paper
pen
and
ink
work
with
illuminated
initials
an
awfully
clever
thing
it
has
caricatures
of
all
the
faculty
representing
the
teachers
as
saying
ridiculous
things
against
secret
societies
in
high
schools
and
so
on
the
boys
meant
to
circulate
it
by
passing
it
around
under
desks
until
all
the
pupils
had
seen
it
so
this
morning
just
as
talbot
called
the
chemistry
class
to
order
the
magazine
was
handed
to
bobs
drake
and
after
a
minute
he
passed
it
over
to
me
opened
at
a
killing
picture
of
talbot
talking
against
football
with
one
side
of
his
mouth
and
against
fraternities
with
the
other
i
don
t
believe
talbot
would
have
noticed
bobs
handing
me
the
magazine
but
jacquette
you
know
my
failing
the
minute
i
saw
that
picture
off
went
my
laugh
right
there
in
class
i
hadn
t
the
slightest
warning
that
it
was
going
to
happen
never
do
have
you
louise
you
poor
girl
well
talbot
was
down
at
my
desk
in
a
flash
and
before
i
could
do
a
thing
he
had
the
in
his
hand
looking
it
through
wasn
t
it
dreadful
there
he
stood
turning
page
after
page
and
we
waited
at
last
he
looked
up
at
quis
and
said
mr
granville
do
you
happen
to
know
who
executed
this
masterpiece
oh
quis
could
have
done
it
but
he
wouldn
t
well
there
were
two
or
three
beta
sigs
sitting
near
quis
and
they
sat
up
straight
but
quis
held
his
head
high
and
said
yes
sir
i
do
no
yes
talbot
was
surprised
too
of
course
his
next
question
was
who
did
it
but
quis
absolutely
refused
to
answer
then
talbot
asked
why
he
wouldn
t
answer
and
quis
gave
one
glance
over
at
the
elk
boys
where
bobs
was
sitting
and
said
because
i
consider
it
dishonourable
to
tell
tales
of
anyone
and
jacquette
the
class
cheered
but
louise
you
aren
t
going
to
say
bobs
did
it
wait
till
i
get
to
that
of
course
talbot
was
angry
at
the
cheering
and
next
thing
turned
on
well
bobs
wouldn
t
answer
either
but
he
did
look
at
quis
as
much
as
to
accuse
him
of
having
given
him
away
i
thought
we
all
expected
it
would
end
in
talbot
s
sending
them
both
to
the
office
but
instead
he
went
back
to
his
desk
and
began
the
recitation
i
guess
he
didn
t
know
that
quis
was
starting
for
new
york
right
after
class
for
he
let
him
get
away
while
he
was
talking
to
bobs
and
the
end
of
it
is
that
bobs
has
gone
to
the
office
and
you
think
bobs
got
up
the
magazine
and
quis
knows
and
won
t
tell
i
don
t
know
you
see
it
stands
against
bobs
that
he
s
been
out
of
school
for
several
days
doing
no
one
knows
what
there
s
so
much
fine
lettering
in
the
magazine
it
would
take
a
great
deal
of
time
and
everyone
knows
how
clever
bobs
is
at
drawing
and
how
he
loves
a
joke
i
m
and
i
don
t
believe
it
if
bobs
had
done
it
he
d
have
owned
but
you
don
t
stop
to
think
jacquette
that
owning
up
would
have
meant
bringing
discredit
on
his
whole
fraternity
the
beta
sigs
would
crow
so
if
the
elks
got
into
disgrace
it
isn
t
a
bit
like
owning
up
i
know
but
i
don
t
believe
it
if
i
could
only
get
hold
of
quis
i
d
make
him
tell
who
did
it
he
said
he
knew
but
his
train
has
started
by
yes
and
you
mustn
t
worry
dear
i
dare
say
bobs
will
come
out
of
it
all
right
everybody
likes
him
so
teachers
and
all
i
m
terribly
sorry
i
laughed
but
i
just
can
t
go
without
my
luncheon
on
account
of
it
i
m
starving
come
and
get
a
sandwich
you
ll
feel
no
i
can
t
eat
a
thing
and
jacquette
starting
back
toward
the
school
alone
turned
the
corner
and
met
bobs
face
to
face
he
would
have
passed
but
she
insisted
on
speaking
and
almost
with
the
first
words
it
came
out
that
he
had
seen
rodney
leaving
her
house
just
after
he
and
the
other
boys
had
been
dismissed
that
day
and
that
his
faith
in
girls
had
vanished
with
the
sight
of
course
the
fellows
had
joked
him
but
that
was
the
least
of
it
the
part
he
could
not
get
over
was
that
he
had
believed
jacquette
to
be
square
and
now
she
had
proved
herself
just
like
all
the
girls
tricky
jacquette
s
explanation
had
waited
so
long
that
the
words
of
it
tumbled
over
each
other
she
looked
very
sweet
and
sorry
standing
there
her
face
flushed
with
feeling
and
as
she
talked
the
winter
wind
caught
one
of
her
curly
yellow
braids
and
tossed
it
over
her
shoulder
bobs
remembered
suddenly
that
she
had
put
her
hair
down
in
braids
the
day
after
he
had
said
sorority
girls
were
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
to
be
he
stamped
the
snow
from
his
feet
irresolute
trying
not
to
forgive
her
then
he
looked
straight
into
her
honest
eyes
and
turning
walked
back
to
the
school
at
her
side
i
see
how
it
was
jack
and
i
d
like
to
shake
hands
on
it
he
said
as
they
reached
the
entrance
i
don
t
know
when
i
ll
see
you
again
i
may
not
come
back
to
school
any
more
after
vacation
i
tried
to
quit
right
after
this
rodney
fletcher
business
but
my
mother
cried
about
it
so
i
couldn
t
you
know
i
haven
t
any
father
to
make
me
do
things
but
when
my
mother
cries
it
s
the
same
thing
so
i
started
in
again
but
now
there
s
a
new
trouble
and
i
don
t
know
what
may
come
of
it
i
m
on
my
way
home
in
disgrace
for
refusing
to
answer
questions
in
the
i
know
what
you
mean
louise
told
me
jacquette
answered
giving
him
her
hand
and
i
just
want
to
say
that
i
don
t
believe
for
one
minute
you
ever
did
bobs
looked
at
her
with
an
expression
that
she
could
not
understand
then
instead
of
saying
as
she
had
hoped
he
would
that
he
had
not
done
it
he
merely
repeated
you
don
t
believe
it
i
m
all
the
way
upstairs
to
mademoiselle
s
room
jacquette
was
asking
herself
what
bobs
had
meant
by
that
response
and
the
question
was
still
troubling
her
when
the
closing
hour
came
that
afternoon
and
mademoiselle
began
to
distribute
the
monthly
report
cards
among
the
pupils
in
her
study
room
jacquette
walked
to
the
desk
slowly
dreading
to
see
hers
and
she
was
not
surprised
when
mademoiselle
in
passing
it
out
looked
at
her
reproachfully
my
little
willard
i
am
sorry
she
said
gravely
will
you
stay
and
talk
with
me
after
school
honey
jacquette
scanned
the
figures
on
the
card
as
she
took
her
seat
she
had
fallen
below
for
the
month
in
algebra
and
physiography
and
her
standing
even
in
english
and
french
was
near
the
danger
mark
sorry
for
you
dear
blanche
gross
whispered
as
the
pupils
rose
to
file
out
of
the
room
come
up
to
the
sorority
rooms
when
mademoiselle
s
done
with
you
and
tell
us
all
about
when
jacquette
lifted
her
eyes
she
found
herself
alone
with
mademoiselle
come
and
sit
here
by
me
dearie
began
the
french
teacher
with
one
of
those
searching
glances
from
under
her
dark
eyebrows
that
is
right
now
chicken
you
were
meant
to
be
a
good
little
child
what
can
be
the
trouble
her
manner
was
gentleness
itself
but
it
compelled
an
answer
and
before
jacquette
realised
what
she
was
doing
she
found
herself
pouring
out
her
troubles
i
know
honey
i
know
mademoiselle
said
at
the
end
i
too
have
seen
this
wonderful
there
is
one
page
with
a
very
dreadful
picture
of
a
french
lady
who
says
lambkin
to
the
big
boys
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
ever
so
little
that
is
mere
fun
the
part
that
worries
me
is
why
did
he
not
own
up
like
a
man
when
he
was
questioned
oh
mademoiselle
jacquette
reproached
her
you
think
he
did
it
there
is
not
one
particle
of
doubt
my
child
when
he
was
in
my
french
class
in
this
very
room
two
years
ago
i
took
from
him
this
same
picture
of
the
french
lady
saying
no
one
else
could
have
reproduced
it
so
perfectly
but
he
was
never
a
sneak
in
those
days
and
i
can
not
believe
now
that
he
realises
how
his
refusal
to
confess
turns
suspicion
upon
an
innocent
what
innocent
party
not
quis
does
anyone
think
quis
did
it
mademoiselle
stared
blankly
dearie
she
said
at
last
honey
my
little
willard
your
cousin
marquis
did
it
quis
did
it
and
then
took
credit
for
keeping
still
because
it
would
be
dishonourable
to
tell
and
let
the
class
cheer
him
and
made
bobs
all
this
trouble
mademoiselle
he
couldn
t
he
has
too
much
conscience
ah
but
he
was
not
using
marquis
granville
s
conscience
when
he
did
this
he
was
governed
by
his
fraternity
conscience
a
vastly
different
thing
from
the
individual
conscience
dearie
whatever
happened
he
must
not
bring
discredit
on
his
beta
sigma
fraternity
don
t
you
see
i
myself
know
one
dear
little
child
with
golden
braids
who
has
been
writing
english
themes
for
another
member
of
her
sorority
just
because
she
has
the
mistaken
idea
that
her
vow
of
sisterhood
requires
that
dishonest
act
but
she
was
governed
by
her
sorority
conscience
when
she
did
jacquette
flushed
scarlet
she
had
not
dreamed
that
anyone
outside
of
the
sorority
knew
how
much
she
was
helping
mamie
coolidge
with
her
english
mademoiselle
you
know
every
single
thing
we
do
she
exclaimed
not
everything
honey
but
more
than
you
guess
you
can
fool
the
pretty
young
teachers
but
the
little
old
french
ladies
with
green
eyes
they
know
know
she
shook
her
head
solemnly
but
the
dimples
came
in
her
cheeks
and
her
eyes
twinkled
you
re
not
old
and
your
eyes
aren
t
green
jacquette
cried
impulsively
you
re
perfectly
darling
and
oh
i
do
believe
you
re
right
about
quis
i
see
it
there
s
no
doubt
of
it
my
chicken
mademoiselle
concluded
beginning
to
put
away
the
books
and
papers
on
her
desk
now
you
are
to
dismiss
from
your
mind
all
the
little
quisses
and
all
the
little
bobses
and
not
worry
about
them
any
more
i
myself
will
write
to
that
dear
little
wretch
in
new
york
you
shall
give
me
his
address
he
will
be
sorry
for
i
know
he
has
not
meant
to
make
so
much
trouble
and
he
will
confess
at
once
you
will
see
for
you
my
sweet
pet
it
is
certainly
trouble
enough
that
you
must
take
home
to
dear
auntie
this
abominable
report
card
but
yet
remember
that
is
in
the
past
your
scholarship
for
the
month
of
december
has
been
sacrificed
honey
laid
on
the
altar
of
what
shall
we
say
of
a
sigma
pi
epsilon
dance
think
it
over
dearie
and
see
if
i
am
right
and
study
a
few
hours
every
day
in
the
christmas
vacation
to
make
up
back
work
then
start
again
with
the
new
year
pass
your
examinations
and
begin
the
next
half
in
february
with
the
spirit
of
work
that
is
all
honey

chapter
viii
february
rushing
mademoiselle
was
a
prophet
her
letter
to
marquis
brought
back
a
prompt
reply
addressed
to
the
principal
of
the
marston
high
school
and
confessing
that
the
though
it
had
been
executed
in
the
beta
sigma
fraternity
house
was
every
stroke
his
work
and
entirely
his
fault
he
offered
an
apology
to
every
teacher
caricatured
both
for
the
personal
affront
and
for
his
own
error
as
regarded
influence
and
example
and
explained
that
when
he
had
refused
to
answer
talbot
on
the
ground
that
it
was
dishonourable
to
tell
tales
he
had
been
led
by
a
desire
to
amuse
his
beta
sigma
brothers
not
in
the
least
by
a
wish
to
turn
suspicion
on
any
other
person
in
fact
though
he
was
ashamed
to
confess
it
he
had
not
once
thought
of
that
as
a
consequence
of
his
act
until
he
had
received
mademoiselle
s
letter
the
communication
was
frank
and
manly
marquis
granville
was
president
of
the
class
which
would
be
graduated
from
marston
in
june
his
record
as
a
student
had
been
exceptionally
brilliant
up
to
this
time
and
he
was
the
son
of
a
wealthy
influential
citizen
one
or
all
of
these
reasons
may
have
worked
in
his
behalf
at
any
rate
when
he
came
back
to
school
after
the
holidays
the
matter
had
been
hushed
and
he
and
bobs
were
both
found
in
their
old
places
meanwhile
the
christmas
holiday
had
been
a
merry
busy
time
for
jacquette
there
had
been
numerous
sorority
engagements
the
most
important
of
which
was
the
annual
luncheon
given
at
one
of
the
fashionable
hotels
for
the
entertainment
of
chapters
of
sigma
pi
but
she
had
firmly
declined
invitations
to
three
alluring
fraternity
dances
and
had
not
only
saved
some
hours
for
study
but
had
gladdened
the
hearts
of
her
grandfather
and
aunt
sula
by
finding
time
to
show
a
little
of
the
old
brookdale
interest
in
the
home
christmas
celebration
she
had
tried
too
to
take
mademoiselle
s
advice
about
putting
the
little
quisses
and
bobses
out
of
her
thoughts
and
she
came
back
to
school
in
january
with
her
face
set
in
the
right
direction
all
that
month
she
studied
hard
doing
the
best
work
of
her
year
and
when
the
came
her
marks
averaged
high
enough
to
pass
her
in
everything
they
were
not
marks
to
be
vain
over
but
at
least
they
gave
her
the
chance
to
go
on
and
do
better
in
the
coming
half
then
came
february
with
its
influx
of
new
girls
from
you
ll
have
to
be
easy
with
me
this
month
tia
jacquette
said
as
she
was
starting
for
school
one
morning
in
the
first
week
of
the
new
half
february
is
the
great
rush
time
of
the
whole
year
for
sororities
even
more
so
than
september
you
see
the
girls
that
get
through
grammar
school
in
february
instead
of
june
are
the
brightest
ones
that
s
the
reason
we
go
after
them
so
hard
of
course
i
m
remembering
our
bargain
and
i
m
not
going
to
let
sigma
pi
interfere
with
my
studies
not
if
i
have
to
sit
up
all
night
to
do
them
but
you
mustn
t
expect
me
home
right
after
school
for
awhile
because
there
ll
be
spreads
and
pledging
and
all
kinds
of
things
going
on
every
it
won
t
be
keeping
the
bargain
though
if
you
have
to
sit
up
all
night
to
do
lessons
aunt
sula
reminded
i
know
i
didn
t
mean
all
night
jacquette
laughed
coaxingly
and
truly
tia
it
s
a
very
special
time
different
from
all
the
rest
of
the
year
explain
it
to
grandpa
please
so
he
won
t
worry
oh
by
the
way
she
called
over
her
shoulder
as
she
hurried
down
the
walk
the
girls
were
crazy
over
those
sandwiches
i
made
for
the
spread
yesterday
they
want
me
to
bring
thirty
more
just
like
them
aunt
sula
smiled
and
sighed
as
she
closed
the
door
but
she
would
have
sighed
without
the
smile
if
she
could
have
looked
into
one
of
the
halls
at
marston
a
half
hour
later
where
two
of
excited
angry
girls
were
lined
up
opposite
each
other
each
with
a
spokesman
in
the
centre
of
its
group
blanche
gross
was
acting
for
sigma
pi
with
jacquette
willard
close
at
her
elbow
while
on
the
other
side
margaret
howland
was
peeping
over
the
shoulder
of
bertha
maxwell
the
kappa
delta
leader
the
quarrel
was
about
the
new
girl
who
had
been
pledged
sigma
pi
the
day
before
we
understand
you
stooped
so
low
as
to
go
out
to
winifred
s
house
last
night
and
actually
try
to
get
her
mother
to
make
her
take
off
her
sigma
pi
ribbons
blanche
was
saying
hotly
we
certainly
did
talk
to
her
mother
bertha
maxwell
answered
for
the
kappa
deltas
we
intend
that
winifred
pierce
and
her
mother
shall
have
their
eyes
open
about
marston
sororities
it
s
not
fair
to
take
possession
of
a
girl
and
overwhelm
her
without
giving
her
a
chance
to
see
other
sororities
and
make
up
her
own
mind
we
want
winifred
to
come
to
our
spread
this
afternoon
and
meet
our
girls
and
her
mother
said
she
could
do
it
well
we
say
she
can
t
and
what
we
say
about
our
pledges
counts
just
a
little
more
than
what
their
mothers
say
you
ll
soon
find
out
oh
does
it
that
will
sound
so
pleasant
to
her
mother
go
and
tell
her
hurry
take
the
first
car
we
ve
understood
before
now
that
kappa
delta
made
a
specialty
of
telling
go
right
on
blanche
gross
bertha
flung
back
you
can
t
trust
your
pledge
to
stay
with
you
if
she
finds
out
about
other
sororities
that
s
the
trouble
no
such
thing
we
d
trust
her
anywhere
but
never
mind
bertha
broke
in
tragically
remember
one
thing
by
fair
means
or
foul
we
ll
have
your
pledge
at
our
spread
this
afternoon
see
if
we
don
t
a
door
opened
my
little
children
my
little
children
said
the
soft
voice
of
mademoiselle
dubois
tardy
every
one
of
you
scamper
pets
the
girls
scattered
it
was
an
incongruous
sight
these
tall
young
ladies
quarrelling
like
children
as
they
separated
with
resentful
glances
at
one
another
bertha
drew
margaret
s
arm
through
hers
but
margaret
looked
back
over
her
shoulder
with
a
half
ashamed
expression
and
jacquette
meeting
her
eyes
remembered
their
happy
friendship
in
brookdale
and
felt
suddenly
foolish
as
she
turned
to
go
into
the
mademoiselle
spoke
to
her
my
little
willard
she
said
in
this
school
there
are
teachers
all
trying
to
pump
knowledge
of
various
kinds
into
the
heads
of
a
thousand
or
more
little
children
this
is
called
getting
a
education
but
i
ask
you
honey
if
these
little
heads
are
quite
quite
full
of
something
else
how
can
the
knowledge
be
put
in
jacquette
felt
the
force
of
this
appeal
but
none
the
less
her
strongest
feeling
as
she
took
her
seat
was
lively
curiosity
to
know
just
what
was
being
done
to
protect
that
sigma
pi
pledge
from
the
kappa
deltas
at
the
beginning
of
second
hour
she
hurried
into
the
hall
and
met
mamie
coolidge
who
had
all
the
news
and
told
it
eagerly
one
of
the
sigma
pi
girls
she
said
had
gone
to
the
principal
and
had
him
excuse
her
from
the
first
two
hours
of
school
on
the
plea
that
she
must
attend
to
some
necessary
business
and
two
more
of
the
girls
had
secured
the
same
kind
of
an
excuse
from
their
room
teachers
then
they
had
gone
out
to
the
corner
drugstore
and
had
telephoned
not
only
to
winifred
s
mother
warning
her
against
the
dishonourable
kappa
deltas
but
to
some
of
the
sigma
pi
alumnæ
and
to
certain
mothers
of
sigma
pi
girls
who
might
do
something
during
the
day
to
influence
pierce
in
favour
of
sigma
pi
did
the
girls
cut
two
hours
of
school
to
do
that
telephoning
jacquette
asked
uneasily
oh
yes
twas
nothing
but
study
hours
for
any
of
them
mamie
answered
carelessly
they
didn
t
miss
any
recitations
at
all
mercy
that
s
the
least
they
could
do
for
sigma
pi
if
they
re
loyal
i
should
say
oh
and
jacquette
pierce
promised
that
winifred
shouldn
t
go
to
the
kappa
delt
spread
and
the
girls
have
decided
to
have
a
special
initiation
and
take
her
in
right
away
just
to
show
the
kappa
delts
that
is
they
want
to
if
the
rest
of
you
agree
blanche
and
etta
are
planning
it
now
it
s
study
period
for
them
so
they
that
was
all
jacquette
had
time
to
hear
and
she
was
late
at
her
algebra
class
as
it
was
after
school
the
sigma
pi
girls
met
and
parcelled
out
the
work
for
the
initiation
next
day
blanche
gross
offered
her
entire
house
because
her
family
was
away
and
jacquette
besides
bringing
a
cake
was
appointed
to
act
on
the
committee
escorting
winifred
to
the
place
of
her
initiation
accordingly
at
nine
the
next
morning
she
went
over
to
mamie
coolidge
s
where
winifred
had
been
summoned
to
appear
blanche
lived
only
a
few
blocks
from
mamie
s
home
but
as
winifred
must
be
made
to
believe
that
her
initiation
would
be
in
some
mysterious
quarter
out
at
the
north
end
of
the
city
it
was
necessary
to
blindfold
her
and
give
her
a
long
ride
so
mamie
coolidge
and
flo
burton
both
freshmen
and
both
irrepressible
romps
were
decking
her
for
the
journey
as
jacquette
came
in
they
had
braided
her
black
hair
in
seven
tight
pigtails
each
of
which
was
so
stiffly
wired
that
they
had
been
able
to
make
it
stand
out
in
wonderful
spiral
twists
giving
a
medusa
effect
that
was
quite
startling
on
the
top
of
her
head
they
had
pinned
a
opera
bonnet
of
a
fashion
long
gone
by
and
for
dress
she
had
on
a
long
bedraggled
white
petticoat
topped
by
a
man
s
black
coat
the
tails
of
which
were
pinned
up
across
the
back
in
two
large
pockets
these
pockets
were
filled
with
faded
roses
and
ferns
and
winifred
was
to
carry
in
both
hands
a
large
bunch
of
wilted
carnations
the
finishing
touch
was
the
bandage
over
her
eyes
it
was
a
red
bandana
padded
with
cotton
to
prevent
a
single
ray
of
light
from
getting
in
jacquette
had
never
seen
a
sigma
pi
pledge
taken
out
on
the
street
looking
quite
so
much
like
a
scarecrow
and
before
they
started
she
took
mamie
and
flo
aside
to
remonstrate
but
they
declared
with
giggles
of
delight
that
they
had
received
instructions
from
headquarters
and
weren
t
going
to
have
them
interfered
with
by
a
freshman
so
the
party
set
out
as
they
were
going
down
the
front
steps
winifred
stumbled
and
nearly
fell
headlong
now
girls
jacquette
exclaimed
speaking
out
before
the
pledge
in
forgetfulness
of
sorority
rules
you
can
t
take
winifred
on
the
car
with
her
eyes
bandaged
like
that
it
s
dangerous
it
wouldn
t
do
a
bit
of
harm
to
loosen
it
just
enough
so
that
she
could
see
the
ground
she
s
walking
it
certainly
would
do
harm
for
it
s
against
orders
flo
burton
insisted
in
her
most
important
manner
and
as
she
spoke
she
took
winifred
by
the
arm
and
turned
her
around
several
times
now
winifred
follow
my
voice
she
said
flo
was
chairman
of
the
committee
and
evidently
meant
to
have
that
fact
remembered
but
there
was
one
thing
jacquette
could
do
and
that
was
to
keep
a
close
hold
of
winifred
s
hand
she
did
this
faithfully
telling
her
when
to
step
up
and
down
and
which
way
to
turn
until
at
last
with
a
sigh
of
relief
she
seated
her
safely
in
the
car
illustration
mamie
and
flo
were
decking
her
for
the
most
of
the
people
who
saw
them
get
on
laughed
at
poor
winifred
s
plight
a
few
looked
disgusted
everyone
stared
two
fellows
took
advantage
of
the
general
merriment
to
attempt
a
flirtation
with
jacquette
who
sat
as
close
to
winifred
as
she
could
without
coming
in
contact
with
the
spiky
braids
which
stuck
out
dangerously
in
all
directions
the
party
rode
to
the
end
of
the
line
and
got
off
without
mishap
winifred
was
marched
a
little
way
in
several
directions
turned
round
and
round
till
she
was
dizzy
to
the
amusement
of
a
group
of
spectators
who
had
stopped
to
watch
the
unusual
sight
and
then
bundled
on
to
the
homeward
car
thoroughly
convinced
that
she
was
bound
for
the
outskirts
of
the
city
as
they
started
back
again
jacquette
still
sitting
by
winifred
caught
a
few
words
of
what
flo
and
mamie
were
saying
in
their
seat
across
the
aisle
they
were
discussing
a
spicy
original
plan
for
the
afternoon
initiation
and
they
mentioned
the
name
of
a
senior
sigma
pi
who
mamie
was
sure
would
help
them
carry
it
through
jacquette
knew
enough
of
initiation
methods
to
guess
pretty
correctly
at
the
part
she
missed
hearing
and
into
her
thoughts
as
the
car
rolled
along
came
that
clause
in
her
bargain
with
aunt
sula
nothing
that
could
offend
the
delicacy
of
a
sensitive
modest
only
lately
louise
and
some
of
the
other
seniors
had
finished
revising
the
sigma
pi
constitution
so
that
there
was
nothing
now
in
the
written
ceremony
which
violated
this
condition
but
it
was
evident
that
the
girls
intended
to
introduce
their
stunt
as
a
surprise
and
put
it
through
before
anyone
had
time
to
object
at
last
cautioning
winifred
not
to
move
until
she
came
back
jacquette
slipped
into
the
vacant
seat
in
front
of
the
other
girls
and
said
i
couldn
t
help
hearing
girls
and
i
just
want
to
say
i
wish
you
wouldn
t
it
seems
to
me
it
s
cruel
and
not
very
there
you
go
jacquette
willard
flo
answered
in
an
exasperated
undertone
you
re
nothing
but
a
freshman
yourself
but
you
try
to
run
the
whole
sorority
we
know
who
s
been
putting
louise
markham
up
to
spoil
the
sigma
pi
initiation
it
s
the
tamest
one
in
school
i
do
believe
a
person
might
as
well
join
a
church
and
have
done
with
it
it
just
makes
me
wish
i
d
gone
some
other
sorority
where
the
girls
believe
in
having
a
little
fun
but
flo
jacquette
protested
determined
to
keep
her
temper
winifred
s
so
young
you
know
only
fourteen
and
her
mother
asked
us
especially
to
give
her
an
easy
time
because
she
s
so
delicate
her
hands
are
cold
as
ice
now
and
her
heart
s
going
like
a
pooh
what
of
it
flo
retorted
and
mamie
added
what
s
an
initiation
good
for
jacquette
if
it
doesn
t
frighten
them
you
re
too
that
s
the
trouble
with
jacquette
had
intended
to
leave
winifred
for
only
a
minute
but
the
discussion
held
her
and
block
after
block
flew
past
while
they
sat
there
arguing
suddenly
they
all
realised
with
a
start
that
the
car
was
stopping
at
their
corner
jacquette
sprang
to
help
winifred
and
the
other
girls
followed
in
a
rush
but
they
were
late
and
the
conductor
either
not
noticing
or
not
caring
that
winifred
was
blindfolded
started
the
car
with
a
jerk
before
she
was
off
the
step
she
might
have
fallen
anyway
for
her
foot
had
caught
in
the
torn
ruffle
of
the
long
white
petticoat
but
with
the
sudden
start
she
lost
her
balance
pitched
forward
plunging
through
jacquette
s
arms
as
if
they
had
been
paper
and
fell
face
downward
with
her
head
almost
under
the
wheels
of
a
passing
wagon
there
were
shouts
from
the
passengers
the
car
stopped
again
and
nearly
everyone
jumped
off
to
crowd
around
the
spot
where
winifred
lay
jacquette
was
down
on
the
ground
trying
with
shaking
fingers
to
untie
the
bandage
that
blinded
winifred
s
eyes
and
shuddering
at
sight
of
the
blood
that
flowed
from
a
cut
on
the
poor
girl
s
cheek
winifred
was
not
unconscious
for
she
had
groaned
when
they
turned
her
and
had
cried
out
oh
my
knee
it
s
my
knee
girls
the
conductor
was
blustering
about
the
idiocy
of
parents
who
allowed
their
daughters
to
do
such
things
when
suddenly
a
stout
man
who
had
been
engrossed
with
his
newspaper
in
the
rear
car
came
pushing
through
the
crowd
and
stopped
in
blank
horror
at
sight
of
the
grotesque
little
figure
stretched
out
on
the
ground
winifred
he
ejaculated
and
winifred
her
eyes
uncovered
now
her
face
bruised
her
queer
little
bonnet
tumbled
off
and
trampled
on
but
her
dreadful
medusa
braids
still
rampant
reached
out
her
hand
to
him
and
answered
piteously
oh
papa
where
did
you
come
from
were
you
on
this
car
don
t
worry
darling
it
s
only
my
initiation
not
one
of
the
girls
had
ever
seen
winifred
s
father
and
not
one
of
them
could
think
of
a
person
who
would
have
been
less
welcome
at
that
moment
he
paid
scant
attention
to
them
however
his
orders
were
quick
and
sharp
and
a
carriage
was
there
to
take
winifred
home
sooner
than
seemed
possible
in
the
meantime
he
had
been
examining
her
injuries
taking
the
conductor
s
number
and
listening
now
and
then
to
a
fragment
from
the
jumble
of
versions
offered
by
the
passengers
who
crowded
about
when
he
had
winifred
safely
in
the
carriage
he
turned
to
jacquette
whose
murmured
sympathy
and
offers
of
help
had
gone
unheeded
i
should
like
your
name
and
address
young
lady
he
said
without
noticing
the
other
frightened
girls
who
had
withdrawn
into
the
background
as
soon
as
he
appeared
and
when
jacquette
had
told
him
who
she
was
he
added
with
suppressed
indignation
i
will
take
care
of
my
daughter
now
as
for
you
i
advise
you
to
go
on
to
the
initiation
you
were
planning
and
tell
your
society
that
winifred
pierce
will
never
become
a
member
of
it
as
long
as
she
has
a
father
to
take
care
of
papa
came
a
pleading
voice
from
the
carriage
but
her
father
stepped
in
and
slammed
the
door
and
they
drove
away
twenty
minutes
later
three
girls
presented
themselves
in
the
library
at
blanche
gross
s
house
and
told
their
story
in
spite
of
the
impromptu
character
of
the
initiation
planned
for
winifred
the
girls
had
taken
advantage
of
their
unusual
freedom
in
blanche
s
beautiful
empty
home
to
make
the
ceremonies
even
more
elaborate
than
usual
a
dozen
of
them
had
been
flying
around
merrily
some
making
chocolate
and
arranging
the
table
in
the
while
others
in
the
basement
prepared
for
certain
mysterious
business
which
was
to
take
place
there
now
they
all
sat
limp
and
speechless
except
for
broken
exclamations
of
dismay
until
at
last
mamie
coolidge
broke
the
spell
by
saying
as
far
as
i
m
concerned
i
think
winifred
pierce
s
father
owes
us
an
apology
everybody
knows
nowadays
that
you
have
a
right
to
do
anything
you
please
at
initiations
this
was
too
much
for
jacquette
without
stopping
to
consider
whether
she
was
a
freshman
or
a
senior
she
began
to
speak
her
mind
she
declared
that
in
her
opinion
it
was
the
sigma
pi
girls
who
owed
the
whole
pierce
family
an
apology
whether
it
turned
out
that
winifred
was
seriously
hurt
or
not
and
as
she
spoke
the
last
word
louise
markham
applauded
but
louise
was
alone
and
no
one
followed
all
around
the
room
were
resentful
faces
and
little
by
little
the
truth
came
out
jacquette
had
made
herself
too
much
of
a
leader
from
the
start
she
wanted
to
manage
everybody
and
she
had
an
idea
that
the
whole
sorority
ought
to
bow
down
to
her
ideas
they
weren
t
going
to
stand
it
any
longer
that
was
the
substance
of
the
complaint
and
that
was
how
it
happened
that
long
before
she
was
expected
jacquette
astonished
aunt
sula
by
walking
into
the
house
and
announcing
dramatically
tia
i
m
done
with
sigma
pi
forever
chapter
ix
jacquette
s
rebellion
done
with
sigma
pi
aunt
sula
echoed
not
able
to
believe
her
ears
but
jacquette
dropping
into
a
chair
and
covering
her
face
with
both
hands
had
begun
to
sob
it
was
with
an
effort
that
she
quieted
herself
to
begin
telling
the
troubles
of
the
afternoon
but
when
she
came
to
the
description
of
the
accident
her
excitement
dried
her
tears
and
yet
she
declared
at
the
end
i
would
have
stood
by
sigma
pi
through
everything
tia
you
know
i
would
if
the
girls
hadn
t
all
turned
against
me
but
everyone
of
them
except
louise
brought
up
some
criticism
they
said
if
i
was
going
to
find
fault
with
the
sorority
i
might
as
well
know
that
the
sorority
had
fault
to
find
with
me
and
that
the
truth
was
i
d
acted
set
up
ever
since
they
were
so
easy
with
me
about
letting
me
keep
on
my
pin
after
my
flunk
in
december
then
mamie
coolidge
showed
out
her
jealousy
of
louise
she
said
it
wasn
t
sorority
spirit
for
me
to
go
so
much
with
one
girl
to
the
exclusion
of
my
other
sisters
and
blanche
gross
put
in
that
she
wouldn
t
say
anything
if
i
d
confine
my
attentions
to
sigma
pi
girls
but
that
i
d
been
seen
bowing
to
and
people
around
school
and
that
i
must
know
it
was
against
sorority
principles
to
do
that
oh
how
angry
that
made
me
i
told
her
it
wasn
t
against
principles
and
i
wasn
t
going
to
have
my
character
all
made
over
by
any
bunch
of
girls
not
even
my
sorority
and
that
one
thing
i
liked
about
louise
was
the
way
she
always
spoke
to
everyone
she
knew
around
school
whether
they
belonged
to
sororities
or
not
then
flo
burton
said
i
might
insist
on
bowing
to
them
but
i
surely
ought
not
to
chum
with
girls
and
that
she
had
noticed
my
walking
to
school
with
fannie
brewster
and
when
i
told
them
fannie
was
poor
and
that
you
thought
she
was
lonely
flo
said
in
the
meanest
way
aunt
sula
again
and
two
or
three
of
the
girls
laughed
as
if
they
had
made
a
joke
of
it
before
do
you
think
i
could
stand
that
i
came
off
and
left
them
and
on
the
way
home
i
decided
i
d
make
you
happy
no
matter
how
i
felt
myself
by
telling
you
that
i
had
done
with
sigma
pi
jacquette
had
hardly
stopped
for
breath
since
the
beginning
of
her
story
but
now
she
lifted
her
face
to
meet
aunt
sula
s
approval
to
her
surprise
it
was
not
there
what
about
the
vows
of
loyalty
sworn
for
life
aunt
sula
asked
her
where
is
the
friendship
that
was
going
to
bear
criticism
this
is
its
first
jacquette
s
eyes
dropped
but
her
voice
was
unyielding
i
can
t
help
that
she
murmured
the
girls
were
mean
and
i
ll
show
them
there
is
such
a
thing
as
going
a
step
too
far
even
in
a
sorority
i
m
going
to
call
up
two
or
three
of
them
this
very
night
and
tell
them
i
ve
decided
to
in
spite
of
her
unhappiness
jacquette
was
getting
a
certain
solace
from
imagining
the
effect
of
this
announcement
but
before
she
had
time
to
gloat
over
it
aunt
sula
astonished
her
still
further
by
saying
decidedly
jacquette
i
m
not
willing
you
should
not
willing
when
you
ve
always
wished
i
wasn
t
in
it
no
i
m
not
if
you
break
these
vows
like
threads
because
you
re
angry
with
the
girls
you
make
it
that
much
easier
for
yourself
to
break
other
promises
and
be
untrue
to
other
obligations
no
i
want
you
to
promise
me
here
and
now
on
your
honour
as
a
sigma
pi
not
to
say
one
word
about
resigning
to
any
of
the
girls
not
even
louise
for
at
least
a
week
and
not
then
until
we
have
talked
it
over
but
instead
of
answering
jacquette
who
had
risen
to
her
feet
in
her
amazement
put
both
hands
to
her
head
and
wavered
backward
i
m
so
dizzy
she
said
lie
down
on
the
couch
there
what
is
it
oh
it
s
nothing
i
guess
only
my
head
aches
i
m
so
tired
and
the
girl
completely
unstrung
buried
her
face
in
the
pillow
and
wept
hysterically
all
that
afternoon
jacquette
lay
in
a
darkened
room
resting
and
thinking
just
before
dinner
louise
ran
in
to
say
how
remorseful
the
girls
had
been
as
soon
as
they
realised
that
they
had
hurt
her
it
came
over
them
all
at
once
that
they
had
gone
too
far
she
said
as
soon
as
you
left
they
began
to
talk
about
the
good
work
you
had
done
for
sigma
pi
and
first
we
knew
it
just
turned
into
a
meeting
of
praise
for
you
mamie
coolidge
and
flo
burton
got
one
good
lecture
for
the
way
they
spoke
about
your
aunt
and
they
re
dreadfully
jacquette
felt
her
heart
softening
as
she
listened
the
promise
to
aunt
sula
had
been
given
and
on
the
whole
she
reflected
it
was
not
a
bad
idea
to
wait
a
week
before
she
acted
as
the
evening
passed
the
telephone
bell
began
to
ring
and
apologies
and
messages
of
love
from
the
sigma
pi
girls
came
over
the
wire
it
was
hard
to
believe
it
but
blanche
gross
proud
cold
blanche
was
actually
crying
when
she
told
jacquette
how
sorry
she
was
for
what
had
happened
at
her
house
that
day
there
was
news
from
winifred
too
some
of
the
girls
had
been
to
inquire
and
though
her
father
had
all
but
shut
the
door
in
their
faces
they
had
learned
that
she
was
not
dangerously
injured
then
came
a
long
restful
sunday
and
by
the
time
jacquette
started
for
school
monday
morning
the
world
had
begun
to
wear
its
natural
colour
the
sorority
girls
gathered
around
her
effusively
and
when
she
went
to
her
desk
she
found
a
beautiful
bunch
of
violets
bearing
the
message
with
the
love
of
your
sigma
pi
up
to
that
instant
jacquette
had
been
secretly
triumphing
over
the
way
she
had
brought
the
girls
to
their
knees
but
those
words
on
the
card
went
through
her
vanity
straight
to
her
heart
and
her
eyes
were
suspiciously
shiny
as
she
turned
to
smile
her
thanks
at
two
sigma
pi
sisters
who
sat
near
then
she
heard
the
voice
of
mademoiselle
summoning
her
to
the
desk
dearie
said
the
little
frenchwoman
in
a
sorry
tone
you
are
wanted
in
the
office
why
mademoiselle
i
haven
t
done
anything
jacquette
protested
and
her
head
went
up
in
a
gesture
that
looked
like
defiance
though
mademoiselle
who
loved
her
knew
that
it
was
not
wait
honey
listen
to
me
pierce
is
there
with
mr
branch
and
he
is
very
angry
about
the
way
his
little
girl
was
treated
on
saturday
she
might
have
been
crippled
for
life
or
even
killed
you
know
it
is
a
mercy
that
she
was
not
they
will
ask
you
questions
and
as
i
tell
you
he
is
very
angry
people
who
are
angry
do
not
choose
their
words
but
you
will
you
remember
one
little
thing
this
between
the
extremes
of
servility
and
impertinence
there
lies
a
golden
mean
called
courtesy
go
as
jacquette
went
up
the
stairs
she
knew
that
sigma
pi
was
in
trouble
the
message
of
the
violets
was
warm
in
her
heart
surely
this
was
no
time
to
desert
the
girls
winifred
pierce
s
father
was
a
detestable
sort
of
man
anyway
that
was
plain
and
her
head
went
up
at
the
thought
then
she
remembered
mademoiselle
s
warning
it
was
a
long
interview
jacquette
was
pale
when
she
came
back
to
the
she
took
her
books
and
went
to
her
algebra
recitation
without
a
glance
at
anyone
the
sigma
pi
girls
were
in
a
flutter
of
anxiety
but
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
wait
presently
mademoiselle
was
called
to
the
office
herself
then
she
came
back
and
sat
at
her
desk
in
a
brown
study
at
last
she
looked
up
and
asked
mamie
coolidge
and
flo
burton
to
step
out
into
the
hall
with
her
as
the
door
closed
behind
the
three
she
said
abruptly
my
chickens
tell
me
who
was
with
the
little
pierce
at
the
time
of
her
accident
saturday
the
girls
looked
at
each
other
mamie
spoke
first
i
was
for
one
she
answered
i
was
too
flo
added
reluctantly
and
jacquette
mademoiselle
s
face
cleared
but
she
shook
her
head
how
it
has
come
about
i
do
not
know
she
went
on
gravely
but
pierce
believes
that
the
little
willard
was
the
only
one
of
you
who
was
with
his
daughter
and
he
holds
her
accountable
for
every
disgraceful
detail
of
that
trouble
he
is
very
angry
he
wishes
to
have
her
publicly
reprimanded
and
he
would
be
glad
if
mr
branch
would
even
expel
her
from
school
and
she
knows
all
about
it
but
she
has
not
once
mentioned
your
names
oh
gasped
both
the
girls
together
then
something
that
until
now
had
been
asleep
woke
within
mamie
is
pierce
in
the
office
yet
she
demanded
may
we
go
straight
up
there
and
tell
him
all
about
it
at
once
dearie
mademoiselle
agreed
with
alacrity
say
to
mr
branch
that
mademoiselle
dubois
gave
you
permission
to
a
minute
later
two
astonished
men
in
the
office
were
listening
to
a
joint
recital
from
two
excited
girls
mr
branch
had
received
them
sternly
as
they
entered
his
eye
taking
in
the
sigma
pi
pins
they
wore
with
a
glance
of
disapproval
he
had
been
not
only
surprised
but
shocked
at
the
account
given
him
by
winifred
s
father
and
he
was
not
disposed
to
treat
the
matter
lightly
pierce
his
face
flushed
his
sandy
beard
bristling
with
indignation
had
just
risen
and
was
buttoning
the
coat
of
his
light
grey
business
suit
but
he
sat
down
again
and
glared
at
the
girls
while
he
listened
bit
by
bit
in
broken
sentences
it
all
came
out
how
jacquette
had
tried
to
restrain
them
at
the
start
how
anxious
she
had
been
to
protect
winifred
how
good
her
influence
had
always
been
in
the
sorority
how
she
had
taken
all
the
blame
on
herself
when
she
was
perfectly
innocent
how
dear
and
sweet
she
was
how
everybody
loved
her
oh
there
there
there
broke
in
pierce
his
bluster
all
gone
as
the
girls
began
to
cry
and
he
actually
pulled
out
his
own
handkerchief
to
polish
his
glasses
this
puts
a
new
light
on
things
i
declare
branch
he
said
turning
to
the
principal
who
from
behind
his
desk
was
watching
developments
with
keen
eyes
will
you
let
me
see
that
willard
girl
again
now
right
away
certainly
was
the
answer
and
stepping
to
the
door
mr
branch
sent
a
messenger
for
jacquette
while
mamie
and
flo
sat
wondering
what
was
going
to
happen
next
pierce
did
not
let
them
wonder
long
as
soon
as
jacquette
appeared
in
the
doorway
he
walked
across
the
room
with
his
hand
outstretched
my
girl
i
want
to
apologise
he
said
bluntly
i
don
t
like
your
sororities
that
s
true
enough
and
i
won
t
send
my
daughter
to
any
school
that
s
in
the
clutch
of
such
an
octopus
as
soon
as
she
s
able
to
walk
i
m
going
to
ship
her
off
to
some
place
where
secret
societies
are
tabooed
but
i
say
branch
still
grasping
jacquette
s
hand
he
turned
to
the
principal
bad
as
these
societies
are
they
can
t
be
all
bad
or
they
couldn
t
turn
out
girls
that
would
stand
by
each
other
like
this
i
want
to
say
that
there
s
not
a
word
of
fault
to
be
found
with
you
he
declared
to
jacquette
while
the
colour
rushed
into
her
sensitive
face
you
tried
to
prevent
the
mischief
but
you
didn
t
shirk
the
blame
even
when
you
had
a
right
to
you
were
respectful
you
were
sorry
and
the
way
you
acted
has
brought
the
best
there
was
in
these
two
girls
right
to
the
surface
mr
branch
i
withdraw
my
complaint
they
won
t
do
this
thing
again
and
they
ve
won
that
much
from
me
by
their
loyalty
to
each
other
as
for
you
my
girl
i
wish
i
had
a
son
like
you
altogether
it
made
an
exciting
story
to
tell
aunt
sula
after
school
and
it
was
a
story
with
a
happy
ending
too
for
when
winifred
s
father
had
finally
gone
mr
branch
had
dismissed
the
girls
with
nothing
worse
than
a
serious
warning
as
to
their
manner
of
conducting
future
initiations
the
first
thing
aunt
sula
said
was
what
a
friend
mademoiselle
is
tia
she
s
a
wonder
she
never
pries
around
to
find
out
things
she
just
understands
and
she
heads
us
away
from
trouble
every
chance
she
can
get
how
did
she
know
i
wasn
t
going
to
be
respectful
to
pierce
but
i
wouldn
t
have
been
without
her
i
ve
been
wondering
what
she
would
think
of
your
determination
to
resign
from
sigma
pi
suppose
you
ask
her
jacquette
s
face
grew
warm
but
she
did
not
drop
her
eyelids
i
ve
been
thinking
that
over
she
answered
tia
do
you
realise
that
in
order
to
resign
i
should
have
to
let
the
girls
expel
me
the
promise
is
once
a
sigma
pi
always
a
sigma
pi
unless
you
re
put
yes
i
know
you
told
and
it
wouldn
t
be
my
own
sorority
alone
that
would
know
about
it
of
course
every
chapter
of
sigma
pi
would
be
told
but
besides
that
an
official
notice
would
be
sent
out
to
every
fraternity
and
sorority
in
marston
stating
that
jacquette
willard
had
been
dishonourably
no
reason
would
be
given
just
the
aunt
sula
waited
i
really
haven
t
any
friends
at
school
outside
of
sigma
pi
jacquette
went
on
slowly
if
i
should
resign
all
my
friends
would
be
my
suppose
some
of
the
girls
should
decide
to
go
out
with
you
and
break
up
sigma
pi
and
let
the
kappa
delts
triumph
over
us
i
couldn
t
bear
it
and
the
girls
wouldn
t
go
with
me
either
when
it
came
to
the
point
they
couldn
t
i
d
resign
alone
and
i
d
be
alone
the
other
sororities
wouldn
t
have
anything
to
do
with
me
and
even
if
there
were
any
girls
worth
knowing
they
wouldn
t
want
me
after
i
had
been
expelled
from
sigma
pi
that
s
true
oh
jacquette
among
so
many
there
must
be
some
nice
ones
who
haven
t
joined
sororities
because
their
parents
didn
t
approve
of
them
or
because
they
couldn
t
stand
the
extra
expense
or
some
such
reason
you
d
find
them
out
before
no
you
can
t
understand
till
you
ve
been
there
the
nice
girls
who
aren
t
allowed
to
join
some
sorority
are
so
unhappy
at
marston
that
their
parents
have
to
send
them
somewhere
else
you
see
pierce
is
going
to
take
winifred
away
besides
jacquette
ended
irrelevantly
quis
and
bobs
would
both
despise
me
if
i
deserted
my
sorority
they
think
girls
are
always
fighting
anyway
they
say
we
don
t
know
how
to
be
real
friends
to
each
but
had
you
forgotten
all
these
things
when
you
said
you
wanted
to
resign
jacquette
no
i
hadn
t
i
counted
the
whole
cost
on
my
way
home
that
day
and
i
thought
i
could
face
it
for
the
sake
of
punishing
the
girls
and
it
isn
t
remembering
these
things
that
makes
me
feel
differently
now
tia
it
s
it
s
oh
it
s
that
bunch
of
violets
with
its
message
don
t
you
see
they
re
a
darling
bunch
of
girls
after
all
i
love
them
tia
i
don
t
see
how
i
could
resign
from
sigma
pi
jacquette
looked
as
if
she
expected
to
be
laughed
at
for
the
confession
but
there
was
not
a
shadow
of
a
smile
on
aunt
sula
s
face
as
she
answered
i
m
not
surprised
dear
i
know
you
love
the
girls
and
i
m
learning
to
feel
the
net
that
closes
about
you
when
you
consider
cutting
loose
from
the
sorority
but
i
want
you
to
think
of
everything
if
you
stand
firm
for
what
you
believe
to
be
right
you
ll
have
these
same
clashes
of
opinion
over
and
over
with
each
new
set
of
girls
that
comes
into
sigma
pi
then
another
thing
you
will
be
expected
more
and
more
to
take
your
part
in
the
delegations
that
make
out
of
town
trips
to
form
new
chapters
the
way
the
juniors
and
seniors
have
to
do
now
and
the
amount
of
money
and
time
and
strength
you
ll
have
to
spend
is
bound
to
increase
instead
of
growing
less
now
is
it
all
worth
while
but
i
don
t
understand
tia
first
you
wouldn
t
let
me
resign
and
now
i
know
i
couldn
t
have
you
break
your
vows
in
a
fit
of
anger
but
i
do
want
to
say
this
if
the
time
ever
comes
when
you
make
up
your
mind
deliberately
without
any
personal
pique
that
the
sorority
is
a
mistake
that
you
re
using
the
best
of
your
efforts
to
build
up
something
that
really
ought
not
to
be
remember
i
ll
stand
by
jacquette
s
face
was
earnest
as
she
leaned
forward
to
answer
that
time
will
never
come
tia
she
said
i
never
realised
until
what
an
influence
i
have
over
the
girls
and
i
m
going
to
use
it
in
the
best
way
for
one
thing
i
m
going
to
begin
new
next
week
and
show
everybody
what
a
good
student
a
sorority
girl
can
be
and
i
m
going
to
stand
by
sigma
pi
and
help
her
grow
into
the
best
biggest
sorority
in
the
whole
united
states
chapter
x
commencement
june
the
month
when
all
the
trees
in
the
city
parks
are
waving
soft
green
arms
and
whispering
secrets
about
how
beautiful
it
must
be
now
away
out
in
the
real
country
jacquette
was
thinking
of
brookdale
as
she
walked
slowly
home
after
school
wondering
if
the
birds
were
singing
there
this
year
just
as
they
always
had
before
every
year
since
she
could
remember
suddenly
she
quickened
her
steps
someone
was
coming
behind
her
and
of
all
things
she
did
not
want
bobs
to
think
she
was
loitering
for
the
sake
of
having
him
walk
with
her
she
turned
a
corner
and
set
off
at
a
brisk
pace
oh
jack
couldn
t
you
go
a
little
faster
a
voice
called
couldn
t
you
come
a
little
slower
she
laughed
turning
and
waiting
until
he
came
up
breathless
i
ve
raced
five
blocks
while
you
were
going
one
he
declared
as
they
fell
into
step
together
had
to
go
over
to
ned
woodward
s
first
and
i
was
afraid
you
d
get
away
i
have
a
lecture
to
give
proceed
honourable
highness
don
t
you
see
how
meek
i
look
no
i
don
t
i
see
how
pale
and
tired
you
look
you
re
not
the
same
girl
that
came
here
from
brookdale
last
a
few
still
like
me
though
put
in
jacquette
with
a
mimic
pout
a
few
indeed
yes
and
my
lecture
s
no
sign
i
don
please
sir
where
is
the
lecture
look
here
jack
i
m
in
earnest
you
re
four
years
younger
than
i
am
and
i
ve
been
studying
your
case
you
needn
t
laugh
and
i
ve
made
up
my
mind
that
you
take
your
sorority
too
hard
for
one
thing
you
girls
all
do
you
put
it
ahead
of
everything
else
and
it
wears
you
out
now
i
d
like
to
see
you
make
up
your
mind
that
next
year
you
ll
spend
more
time
in
gym
and
less
on
sorority
business
why
don
t
you
go
in
for
dr
bobs
drake
jacquette
mocked
but
she
liked
the
lecture
for
all
that
look
at
louise
markham
she
s
a
sorority
girl
and
a
splendid
student
and
a
picture
of
radiant
health
at
the
end
of
her
course
now
where
s
your
argument
jack
he
answered
i
don
t
know
what
the
sorority
cause
is
going
to
do
next
year
when
louise
goes
off
to
college
have
you
ever
noticed
how
she
s
the
one
girl
that
s
always
pointed
at
to
prove
that
sororities
aren
t
harmful
she
s
a
stunning
argument
but
i
don
t
know
another
girl
anywhere
who
can
carry
all
the
school
work
and
all
the
social
business
she
can
and
not
get
fagged
you
know
very
well
that
with
most
of
them
the
school
work
has
to
go
under
isn
t
that
so
honest
what
about
fraternities
jacquette
evaded
you
re
a
pretty
one
to
preach
with
your
pin
right
there
in
sight
oh
boys
are
different
we
have
a
lot
of
fun
but
we
don
t
get
tragic
over
it
and
have
hysterics
and
nervous
prostration
the
way
the
girls
do
do
you
suppose
my
fraternity
ever
kept
me
from
eating
three
square
meals
a
day
i
don
t
believe
it
has
interfered
with
my
studies
much
either
for
that
if
that
isn
t
just
like
a
boy
jacquette
retorted
fraternities
are
all
right
for
them
but
sororities
are
bad
for
girls
you
ask
any
of
the
teachers
at
marston
and
i
ll
wager
they
ll
tell
you
there
isn
t
much
choice
between
frats
and
sororities
anyway
bobs
drake
she
added
shifting
base
with
feminine
agility
so
far
as
school
work
is
concerned
my
sorority
hasn
t
interfered
with
mine
one
bit
more
than
football
has
with
you
can
t
tell
me
anything
about
that
he
admitted
and
i
ve
played
my
last
football
you
ve
played
your
last
that
s
right
i
m
going
to
college
on
a
new
basis
the
curriculum
requires
enough
athletics
to
keep
a
fellow
in
trim
and
that
s
all
i
m
going
to
have
after
this
it
s
no
use
pretending
that
a
fellow
can
do
his
best
work
on
his
studies
when
he
s
so
tired
that
it
s
all
he
can
do
to
sit
up
i
m
face
to
face
with
the
business
of
being
a
man
jacquette
walked
a
little
way
dumb
with
astonishment
bobs
drake
forswearing
football
she
was
almost
afraid
of
him
but
at
last
she
turned
robin
sidney
drake
she
said
you
make
me
so
proud
of
you
i
don
t
know
how
to
express
it
to
say
that
bobs
looked
pleased
tells
nothing
his
whole
face
beamed
my
make
as
happy
as
a
big
he
answered
fervently
they
were
almost
home
now
robin
sidney
drake
he
repeated
presently
that
s
the
way
you
ll
have
to
address
the
envelopes
when
i
m
at
college
next
what
envelopes
sir
well
i
was
thinking
of
mailing
you
some
catalogues
and
i
hoped
you
might
acknowledge
they
both
laughed
the
laughter
of
comrades
won
t
you
come
in
jacquette
asked
holding
out
her
hand
for
the
books
he
had
been
carrying
can
t
do
it
have
to
work
on
my
class
prophecy
you
got
me
into
trouble
last
november
when
you
made
me
write
that
sonnet
young
lady
i
m
doing
this
prophecy
in
rhyme
and
it
s
turning
my
hair
i
m
wild
to
hear
it
you
and
quis
will
be
the
only
ones
to
represent
the
class
friday
night
won
t
you
what
are
you
going
to
prophesy
for
quis
bobs
oh
there
was
only
one
thing
to
do
for
him
i
ve
made
him
a
diplomat
with
a
strong
prospect
of
becoming
secretary
of
good
and
louise
i
had
a
time
deciding
about
louise
she
s
so
versatile
she
might
turn
out
to
be
anything
at
first
i
couldn
t
think
of
one
talent
that
was
more
conspicuous
than
the
rest
but
i
struck
it
at
last
i
m
not
going
to
tell
though
i
want
to
keep
it
for
a
surprise
say
jack
bobs
had
started
but
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
came
back
there
s
one
thing
that
bothers
me
quis
has
never
felt
right
toward
me
yet
i
don
t
believe
anybody
else
at
marston
has
anything
against
me
but
he
never
looks
me
in
the
eye
if
he
can
help
it
and
i
care
i
want
to
quit
it
s
too
bad
bobs
she
sympathised
why
can
t
he
let
bygones
be
bygones
i
think
you
had
as
much
to
forgive
as
he
after
that
performance
but
don
t
worry
you
ve
done
all
you
could
good
luck
to
the
prophecy
the
assembly
room
at
marston
high
school
was
far
from
being
large
enough
for
the
audience
which
always
attended
the
graduating
exercises
and
the
custom
was
to
rent
a
neighbouring
hall
for
the
june
celebration
it
was
friday
evening
eight
o
clock
and
every
seat
in
the
hall
was
filled
on
the
stage
framed
by
garlands
of
green
stuff
and
roses
sat
the
principal
the
faculty
the
graduating
class
and
the
boys
and
girls
glee
club
through
the
open
window
the
soft
june
breeze
crept
in
gently
stirring
fluffy
locks
and
filmy
ruffles
in
the
front
seats
as
usual
there
was
a
picturesque
row
of
sigma
pi
girls
but
their
ranks
were
thinned
that
night
five
of
them
were
on
the
platform
saying
farewell
to
marston
high
louise
markham
was
one
of
the
five
and
from
her
seat
with
the
class
she
smiled
straight
down
into
the
adoring
eyes
of
jacquette
willard
who
was
almost
hidden
behind
the
mammoth
bunch
of
pink
roses
she
had
brought
for
louise
while
aunt
sula
sitting
with
her
father
watched
the
loving
looks
exchanged
between
the
two
girls
and
thought
regretfully
how
much
jacquette
would
miss
louise
s
companionship
in
the
year
that
was
coming
then
the
piano
sounded
and
the
glee
club
stood
up
to
sing
everything
moved
like
clockwork
branch
s
remarks
were
in
an
unusually
happy
vein
the
glee
club
outdid
itself
marquis
s
address
as
class
president
was
a
gem
worthy
of
a
college
graduate
his
hearers
declared
and
last
of
all
came
robin
sidney
drake
class
prophet
the
enthusiasm
was
uproarious
as
bobs
took
the
front
of
the
stage
everybody
there
knew
what
always
happened
when
marston
s
beloved
bobs
tried
to
make
a
speech
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
haunting
fear
that
his
tongue
might
cleave
to
the
roof
of
his
mouth
when
he
tried
to
prophesy
kept
his
audience
cheering
and
cheering
to
put
off
the
evil
moment
but
if
that
was
true
the
fears
were
wasted
bobs
had
committed
the
prophecy
to
memory
and
he
did
not
forget
perhaps
it
was
because
they
were
surprised
at
his
ability
to
speak
at
all
that
his
prophecy
seemed
so
good
perhaps
it
really
was
a
wonderful
piece
of
wit
in
either
case
he
kept
his
hearers
convulsed
with
merriment
from
the
first
word
to
the
last
all
over
the
house
solemn
faces
broadened
into
grins
tears
rolled
down
the
cheeks
of
dignified
teachers
and
it
was
only
by
the
greatest
effort
that
anyone
stopped
laughing
after
each
sally
long
enough
to
let
him
pronounce
the
next
the
principal
the
teachers
the
members
of
the
class
had
been
told
off
in
the
prophecy
until
louise
markham
was
the
only
one
left
bobs
paused
abruptly
and
glanced
in
her
direction
then
he
said
to
the
audience
in
a
confidential
tone
wouldst
know
how
future
years
shall
celebrate
miss
markham
s
name
she
ll
have
to
sell
that
laugh
to
phonographs
its
rippling
cadences
must
surely
bring
her
endless
fame
for
list
a
moment
while
louisa
laughs
he
turned
and
flourished
his
hand
toward
louise
with
the
air
of
a
showman
there
was
a
second
of
absolute
silence
then
as
the
drollery
of
the
situation
flashed
upon
her
the
red
lips
parted
and
out
bubbled
the
irresistible
laugh
bobs
made
a
low
bow
of
gratitude
to
her
another
to
the
audience
and
modestly
took
his
seat
amid
shouts
of
laughter
and
rounds
of
applause
it
was
a
long
time
before
mr
branch
could
quiet
the
audience
for
it
seemed
as
if
the
event
of
the
evening
had
taken
place
but
when
people
finally
caught
a
hint
of
what
he
was
trying
to
say
they
leaned
forward
and
listened
eagerly
enough
he
was
about
to
present
the
university
scholarship
which
was
carried
off
each
year
by
the
brightest
star
of
the
graduating
class
and
he
was
explaining
as
he
always
did
that
it
was
awarded
not
only
in
recognition
of
good
scholarship
but
of
exemplary
deportment
during
all
the
four
years
of
work
most
of
the
pupils
who
knew
the
history
of
marquis
granville
s
last
year
at
marston
thought
they
remembered
one
good
reason
why
he
should
not
get
that
scholarship
and
yet
somehow
in
spite
of
this
they
all
expected
that
his
name
would
be
the
one
pronounced
instead
to
their
surprise
they
saw
the
principal
in
closing
step
forward
toward
bobs
drake
no
past
bobs
drake
he
laid
the
precious
document
in
the
small
white
hands
of
louise
edwina
markham
nobody
had
expected
it
and
yet
as
soon
as
it
had
happened
everybody
felt
that
it
was
the
right
ending
to
the
story
and
everybody
proceeded
to
express
that
feeling
the
blood
rushed
to
louise
s
cheeks
and
her
dark
eyes
shone
but
she
kept
a
sweet
composure
through
all
the
long
and
until
the
last
word
of
the
closing
song
was
sung
and
the
end
of
the
programme
announced
at
that
instant
jacquette
her
face
glowing
with
pride
and
gladness
made
a
dash
for
louise
but
oddly
enough
before
she
could
reach
her
idol
she
came
face
to
face
with
quis
and
bobs
who
happened
to
be
crowded
close
together
in
the
confusion
following
dismissal
both
boys
saw
her
coming
and
each
taking
it
for
granted
that
she
was
rushing
straight
toward
him
held
out
his
hand
like
a
flash
before
either
could
feel
his
mistake
the
girl
caught
both
hands
one
in
her
right
and
the
other
in
her
left
boys
you
were
splendid
you
were
glorious
she
cried
straight
from
her
heart
quis
your
address
was
great
and
bobs
the
words
failed
for
suddenly
she
felt
the
barrier
of
constraint
between
the
boys
and
with
a
swift
impulse
not
stopping
to
fear
consequences
she
drew
their
two
right
hands
together
and
darted
one
appealing
glance
at
quis
this
time
he
did
not
fail
her
yes
old
man
you
re
the
one
to
be
congratulated
he
cried
grasping
bobs
s
hand
so
quickly
that
jacquette
s
part
was
almost
lost
my
speech
was
an
everyday
oration
but
that
prophecy
of
yours
was
a
stroke
of
genius
we
re
all
proud
of
it
i
tell
you
bobs
s
face
lighted
up
he
tried
to
speak
but
before
the
words
could
form
his
blue
eyes
had
said
it
all
and
jacquette
standing
close
to
them
both
murmured
with
a
tremble
in
her
voice
oh
boys
i
m
so
glad
at
that
moment
the
gentle
fingers
of
mademoiselle
dubois
were
laid
on
the
clasped
hands
of
the
two
young
men
my
little
peacocks
she
said
caressingly
with
a
quick
understanding
glance
from
one
to
the
other
i
am
ravished
to
see
the
heroes
of
the
evening
clasping
hands
bobs
drake
you
sinner
struck
in
a
merry
voice
from
over
jacquette
s
shoulder
how
dared
you
and
to
think
that
i
should
help
you
to
disgrace
me
in
my
last
moments
at
marston
i
acted
just
like
a
trained
animal
louise
louise
that
scholarship
jacquette
whirling
around
and
venting
her
deferred
congratulations
in
a
smothering
embrace
here
come
the
sigma
pi
girls
to
hug
you
look
out
for
yourself
with
the
sigma
pi
girls
came
the
fond
mothers
and
fathers
the
grandfathers
and
aunt
sulas
the
uncle
macs
and
aunt
fannys
the
brothers
and
sisters
and
all
the
rest
of
the
proud
happy
friends
everybody
s
face
was
covered
with
smiles
everybody
s
voice
was
bright
with
gladness
but
through
all
those
blithesome
moments
in
the
depths
of
one
girl
s
heart
was
running
an
undercurrent
of
feeling
that
no
one
guessed
she
kept
it
hidden
until
she
and
aunt
sula
were
quite
alone
at
home
then
she
put
both
hands
on
the
little
woman
s
shoulders
and
said
in
a
low
voice
tia
i
saw
you
when
they
gave
louise
that
scholarship
i
saw
the
look
on
your
face
it
was
just
a
look
of
yearning
envy
and
tia
don
t
deny
it
it
was
because
you
knew
my
first
year
s
marks
were
so
low
that
i
couldn
t
get
the
scholarship
now
no
matter
how
i
might
try
the
rest
of
the
time
there
isn
t
any
chance
to
get
it
now
and
oh
the
reason
i
feel
the
worst
is
because
i
can
t
help
knowing
that
my
sorority
has
lost
me
the
chance
she
hid
her
face
on
aunt
sula
s
shoulder
i
don
t
know
how
louise
ever
managed
to
be
a
sorority
girl
and
a
good
student
too
she
murmured
the
rest
of
us
can
t
tia
i
believe
i
d
give
up
anything
if
i
could
only
get
back
the
chance
of
winning
that
scholarship
for
you
aunt
sula
patted
her
tenderly
there
s
something
i
care
for
more
than
scholarships
jacquette
she
said
cheerily
and
you
haven
t
lost
your
chance
for
that
it
s
the
development
of
character
learning
to
see
things
in
their
relative
proportions
and
to
choose
the
best
things
that
stands
before
high
marks
i
think
though
high
marks
are
almost
sure
to
be
a
part
of
there
was
silence
for
a
minute
then
jacquette
lifted
her
face
do
you
mean
she
asked
doubtfully
that
if
i
were
to
try
just
as
hard
in
studies
and
deportment
from
now
on
as
if
i
were
working
for
that
scholarship
with
a
real
chance
of
winning
it
would
be
worth
as
much
as
the
scholarship
itself
to
you
more
jacquette
s
hand
moved
toward
her
heart
and
drew
back
irresolute
tia
she
begged
her
voice
breaking
do
you
believe
it
s
actually
true
as
the
girls
say
that
if
i
resign
from
sigma
pi
i
won
t
have
any
friends
in
school
not
one
she
stood
in
the
white
gown
she
had
worn
that
evening
all
unconscious
of
the
commanding
power
of
her
youth
and
sweetness
and
the
little
woman
who
loved
her
with
a
great
love
looked
up
into
her
face
no
she
answered
emphatically
it
is
not
true
slowly
jacquette
s
hand
moved
again
to
the
sigma
pi
pin
on
her
breast
unclasped
it
and
held
it
in
her
hand
i
ve
made
up
my
mind
to
do
it
she
said
chapter
xi
compromise
when
jacquette
came
down
to
breakfast
the
next
morning
looking
pale
in
spite
of
her
fresh
pink
and
white
gown
her
grandfather
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
waiting
and
as
she
paused
on
the
last
step
he
put
both
hands
on
her
shoulders
and
kissed
her
not
a
word
was
said
about
the
missing
sigma
pi
pin
but
jacquette
glancing
past
him
saw
the
tremulous
smile
on
aunt
sula
s
face
and
knew
that
both
these
dearest
people
on
earth
understood
how
hard
it
had
been
for
her
to
make
the
decision
of
the
night
before
and
were
keeping
back
the
expression
of
their
own
gladness
for
her
sake
it
touched
her
deeply
to
realise
how
much
the
gentle
old
man
had
really
cared
during
all
the
months
when
he
had
kept
so
silent
and
the
answering
hug
she
gave
him
spoke
her
feeling
as
plainly
as
words
after
that
they
went
to
the
table
and
chatted
about
the
graduating
exercises
bobs
s
prophecy
and
louise
s
honours
as
lightly
as
if
no
such
thing
as
resignation
from
a
sorority
had
ever
been
thought
of
until
just
as
they
were
rising
from
breakfast
aunt
sula
happened
to
say
of
course
uncle
malcolm
and
aunt
fanny
were
disappointed
that
quis
didn
t
take
the
scholarship
but
it
must
have
been
easier
for
them
to
see
louise
carry
it
off
than
anyone
else
she
s
such
a
pet
with
them
they
couldn
t
help
being
then
jacquette
s
grandfather
slipping
one
arm
around
his
little
daughter
and
the
other
around
the
tall
girl
he
called
goldilocks
said
slowly
i
suppose
the
markhams
think
they
re
the
proudest
happiest
family
in
town
this
morning
but
they
re
he
was
looking
into
jacquette
s
eyes
as
he
spoke
and
in
spite
of
a
choking
sensation
in
her
throat
she
smiled
back
at
him
bravely
while
she
squeezed
aunt
sula
s
hand
it
was
a
comfort
to
feel
that
they
all
understood
without
words
before
the
morning
was
over
jacquette
slipped
away
for
a
talk
with
louise
and
when
she
came
back
she
went
straight
to
aunt
sula
s
room
tia
she
said
don
t
think
i
m
weakening
but
louise
advises
me
not
to
take
off
my
pin
yet
and
not
to
say
a
word
to
any
of
the
girls
until
they
all
come
together
again
at
the
beginning
of
the
fall
term
there
won
t
be
any
sorority
doings
in
vacation
anyway
and
some
of
the
girls
have
gone
away
for
the
summer
already
and
several
more
start
and
she
says
if
i
should
tell
the
few
that
are
left
they
would
begin
to
write
letters
to
the
others
giving
their
versions
of
the
matter
and
my
reasons
wouldn
t
be
half
as
well
understood
as
if
i
went
to
the
first
sorority
meeting
of
the
year
myself
and
explained
it
to
them
all
at
the
same
that
sounds
sensible
perhaps
she
s
right
aunt
sula
agreed
how
does
she
feel
about
what
you
re
going
to
do
oh
she
s
the
same
trump
as
ever
at
first
she
felt
that
i
couldn
t
do
it
that
i
wouldn
t
be
able
to
stand
the
way
the
girls
would
act
but
after
that
she
praised
me
until
i
felt
foolish
but
still
jacquette
stopped
as
if
sorry
she
had
begun
the
sentence
well
she
says
tia
that
if
she
were
going
to
be
here
in
high
school
another
year
she
s
afraid
she
couldn
t
follow
my
lead
it
would
be
more
than
she
could
bear
to
have
all
the
sigma
pi
girls
turn
against
there
was
a
silence
before
aunt
sula
answered
never
think
dear
that
i
don
t
appreciate
how
hard
it
and
don
t
you
ever
think
i
m
going
back
on
it
jacquette
cried
brushing
away
a
few
tears
that
had
come
in
spite
of
her
will
you
explain
to
grandpa
why
i
put
this
on
again
i
i
d
rather
not
have
to
speak
about
she
walked
to
the
mantel
where
the
sigma
pi
pin
had
lain
all
night
tell
him
i
m
just
going
to
wear
it
until
school
begins
louise
says
it
would
start
questioning
if
i
happened
to
meet
any
of
the
girls
without
having
it
on
and
she
thinks
it
will
be
so
much
better
to
tell
them
all
together
yes
i
ll
tell
him
aunt
sula
promised
watching
jacquette
s
tender
glance
at
the
little
pin
does
it
really
mean
so
much
more
to
you
than
any
other
piece
of
jewellery
oh
it
does
it
stands
for
so
many
things
all
my
marston
good
times
all
my
friendships
with
the
girls
why
anybody
else
but
you
would
think
it
was
perfectly
foolish
if
i
should
tell
how
it
makes
me
feel
to
think
of
leaving
off
that
pin
but
there
we
re
not
going
to
talk
about
it
all
summer
where
s
that
dimity
you
said
i
could
make
into
a
waist
if
i
m
going
to
be
an
accomplished
dressmaker
before
vacation
s
over
i
mustn
t
lose
any
so
she
plunged
into
the
summer
determined
not
to
make
her
sacrifice
unlovely
and
she
succeeded
through
all
the
busy
weeks
that
followed
in
july
there
was
a
visit
to
brookdale
and
after
that
by
her
sweetest
wiles
she
coaxed
her
grandfather
into
a
bracing
trip
on
the
lakes
with
aunt
sula
and
herself
and
brought
him
home
feeling
years
younger
and
happier
then
came
a
series
of
farewell
and
picnics
in
the
park
with
louise
and
marquis
and
bobs
for
the
two
boys
had
honestly
buried
the
hatchet
on
the
night
of
their
graduation
and
they
and
louise
were
bent
on
making
the
most
of
these
last
days
with
jacquette
before
starting
away
for
their
first
year
of
college
work
there
was
no
end
to
the
frolics
they
planned
and
carried
out
until
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
all
the
hurry
and
fun
came
the
opening
day
of
school
at
marston
high
except
louise
marquis
and
bobs
were
the
only
ones
outside
of
home
who
had
been
told
jacquette
s
intention
in
regard
to
her
sorority
bobs
had
received
the
news
very
quietly
it
ll
take
sand
was
his
one
comment
and
you
have
but
telling
marquis
had
been
another
matter
it
s
a
quixotic
attitude
imported
from
brookdale
and
you
ll
find
it
doesn
t
belong
in
channing
he
had
declared
aunt
sula
and
grandfather
mean
all
right
i
know
but
their
ideas
are
about
some
things
and
nobody
will
get
your
point
of
view
at
all
everybody
at
marston
will
set
you
down
as
funny
i
m
going
to
have
mother
go
over
and
talk
to
aunt
the
next
day
aunt
fanny
had
come
and
had
said
a
great
deal
in
her
own
forceful
way
about
the
pity
of
making
jacquette
a
social
outcast
for
the
remaining
three
years
of
her
life
especially
after
marquis
had
interested
himself
so
much
to
get
her
nicely
started
with
the
right
girls
it
was
only
the
course
of
nature
she
maintained
that
in
a
public
school
where
all
classes
were
thrown
together
the
carefully
girls
should
band
together
and
be
separated
from
the
rabble
sula
granville
s
answer
had
been
that
though
she
was
glad
of
jacquette
s
decision
she
had
never
urged
it
and
true
to
the
spirit
of
this
she
told
her
every
word
that
aunt
fanny
had
said
apparently
there
was
no
result
but
the
warnings
found
a
sensitive
spot
none
the
less
and
they
were
all
surging
through
jacquette
s
mind
when
she
stood
up
at
the
first
sorority
meeting
of
the
year
and
faced
her
sigma
pi
sisters
it
was
a
sparse
little
gathering
compared
with
the
last
one
of
the
spring
before
some
of
the
girls
had
moved
during
the
summer
others
had
been
graduated
still
others
had
broken
off
their
course
at
marston
to
go
away
to
a
finishing
school
the
sigma
pi
ranks
would
soon
be
filled
by
new
girls
in
fact
there
were
five
or
six
being
rushed
even
now
but
there
were
less
than
a
dozen
at
the
meeting
for
a
minute
jacquette
s
words
refused
to
come
she
remembered
bobs
s
faith
it
ll
take
sand
and
you
have
at
the
same
instant
she
met
the
loving
eyes
of
louise
sitting
there
in
all
the
dignity
of
an
alumna
among
the
other
girls
she
knew
very
well
why
louise
had
taken
time
in
the
hurry
of
preparation
for
her
year
away
from
home
to
come
to
that
meeting
and
the
knowledge
helped
then
she
thought
of
tia
and
began
it
was
a
simple
straightforward
story
told
with
evident
effort
and
listened
to
in
breathless
silence
by
the
girls
as
jacquette
went
on
a
blank
dismay
grew
on
all
the
faces
but
to
her
relief
there
was
not
a
trace
of
the
unfriendly
resentment
and
bitterness
that
she
had
dreaded
it
dawned
upon
her
while
she
stood
there
speaking
that
a
very
different
feeling
had
grown
up
between
herself
and
the
girls
since
the
quarrel
of
almost
a
year
before
and
the
thought
added
a
new
hurt
to
the
step
she
was
taking
but
it
did
not
make
her
falter
she
told
them
frankly
how
the
first
half
of
her
freshman
year
had
been
so
filled
to
overflowing
with
sorority
business
and
sorority
fun
that
her
studies
had
been
a
farce
how
she
had
often
been
actually
crowded
into
the
necessity
of
preparing
one
lesson
during
the
recitation
of
another
she
reminded
them
of
her
failure
to
pass
for
the
month
in
two
studies
just
before
the
and
of
her
determination
after
that
to
show
everybody
that
she
could
be
a
sorority
girl
and
a
student
too
an
undertaking
which
had
proved
too
much
for
her
physical
strength
but
it
isn
t
only
on
account
of
scholarship
and
health
that
i
m
saying
this
she
finished
honestly
the
truth
is
girls
while
i
love
you
all
as
much
as
ever
i
can
t
help
knowing
that
i
do
owe
something
to
my
home
and
the
people
in
it
last
year
it
was
just
a
place
to
rush
into
for
eating
and
sleeping
my
interests
were
all
somewhere
else
another
thing
i
haven
t
a
rich
father
the
way
most
of
you
have
i
haven
t
any
father
living
there
is
a
certain
sum
of
money
set
aside
for
my
education
but
it
isn
t
large
and
the
proportion
of
it
that
went
into
my
first
year
at
marston
was
so
much
more
than
it
had
any
right
to
be
that
the
one
reason
of
expense
is
enough
to
make
me
feel
that
i
ought
to
give
up
being
a
sigma
jacquette
felt
her
knees
begin
to
shake
as
she
reached
this
period
and
she
sat
down
rather
abruptly
for
a
minute
no
one
made
a
sound
then
mamie
coolie
leaning
forward
asked
in
a
horrified
tone
jacquette
you
can
t
mean
you
re
going
to
make
us
expel
you
jacquette
s
face
quivered
but
she
managed
to
answer
steadily
i
suppose
it
s
the
only
oh
how
dreadful
but
we
expel
tell
her
she
s
wild
to
think
of
talk
her
out
of
it
louise
were
the
whispers
that
flew
round
the
room
flo
burton
sprang
to
her
feet
to
protest
but
she
sat
down
again
sobbing
and
then
handkerchief
after
handkerchief
went
up
as
the
girls
saw
that
there
were
tears
in
jacquette
s
own
eyes
etta
brainerd
who
was
presiding
still
sat
in
dumb
amazement
trying
to
grasp
the
full
significance
of
the
thing
when
louise
markham
s
voice
caught
the
attention
of
everybody
i
just
want
to
remind
you
girls
she
was
saying
quietly
that
inactive
membership
excuses
a
member
from
all
duties
connected
with
the
sorority
she
isn
t
required
to
help
in
the
rushing
to
go
to
spreads
or
initiations
in
fact
to
do
anything
she
doesn
t
have
to
pay
dues
she
simply
wears
her
pin
and
is
just
as
much
one
of
us
as
ever
in
her
spirit
toward
us
and
ours
toward
her
she
s
allowed
to
know
sorority
secrets
and
she
gets
bids
to
the
dances
and
all
that
just
like
an
alumna
and
the
best
of
it
all
is
that
no
one
outside
of
the
sorority
has
to
be
any
the
wiser
there
s
not
a
thing
about
inactive
membership
that
could
possibly
interfere
with
one
s
scholarship
or
one
s
health
or
one
s
and
if
the
time
comes
when
circumstances
permit
the
inactive
member
to
become
active
again
all
she
has
to
do
is
to
say
so
of
course
i
don
t
want
to
dictate
when
i
m
not
going
to
be
here
myself
but
i
just
offer
these
remarks
as
a
that
s
the
thing
flo
burton
exclaimed
as
louise
took
her
seat
that
s
what
we
ll
do
make
her
inactive
for
a
you
needn
t
do
a
bit
of
work
jacquette
but
we
can
t
spare
you
and
we
just
disgrace
you
before
the
whole
school
we
love
you
too
oh
i
m
so
glad
you
spoke
of
that
louise
cried
all
the
girls
together
throwing
the
order
of
the
meeting
to
the
winds
as
they
crowded
about
the
chair
where
jacquette
sat
her
face
flooded
with
sudden
gladness
louise
had
not
given
her
an
inkling
of
what
she
meant
to
do
and
jacquette
had
never
thought
of
hoping
that
the
girls
might
cling
to
her
regardless
of
her
active
usefulness
to
the
sorority
the
whole
spirit
of
the
meeting
was
so
different
from
the
thing
which
she
had
braced
herself
to
endure
that
it
swept
her
along
unresisting
and
it
began
to
seem
as
if
she
had
created
in
her
own
imagination
a
bogy
which
never
existed
what
harm
could
there
be
in
simply
keeping
the
friendship
of
the
girls
oh
louise
she
whispered
eagerly
catching
the
hand
of
her
closest
friend
do
you
think
it
s
all
right
would
tia
be
just
as
well
pleased
don
t
see
why
not
was
the
sturdy
answer
it
gives
you
back
all
your
time
for
study
and
home
things
and
just
prevents
your
losing
the
friendship
of
the
girls
you
like
best
i
think
she
ll
be
glad
or
i
shouldn
t
have
proposed
illustration
they
crowded
about
jacquette
her
face
flooded
with
sudden
so
it
was
settled
and
when
jacquette
still
wearing
her
pin
walked
home
with
a
of
devoted
sigma
pi
girls
following
to
the
door
it
seemed
as
if
a
great
cloud
had
rolled
out
of
her
sky
inactive
membership
would
have
seemed
impossible
before
the
moment
when
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
endure
actual
expulsion
but
now
with
its
promise
of
comparative
secrecy
its
assurance
of
continued
friendship
from
the
girls
and
its
possibility
of
a
return
to
activity
sometime
in
the
future
it
glittered
like
a
beautiful
reward
of
virtue
she
was
so
sure
of
having
done
the
right
thing
that
it
was
hard
to
be
patient
and
explain
when
aunt
sula
and
her
grandfather
seemed
doubtful
but
she
succeeded
and
when
she
finally
went
upstairs
alone
she
smiled
at
a
happy
jacquette
in
the
mirror
resolving
that
tia
should
see
from
day
to
day
how
truly
inactive
membership
would
give
all
the
benefits
and
none
of
the
drawbacks
of
the
uncompromising
other
plan
jacquette
was
early
at
school
the
next
morning
and
mademoiselle
gave
her
an
approving
nod
then
she
asked
her
to
help
two
new
pupils
in
making
out
their
programme
it
happened
that
they
were
both
girls
who
had
been
singled
out
the
day
before
as
possible
members
of
sigma
pi
and
though
jacquette
fully
intended
to
keep
out
of
the
rushing
she
was
glad
of
an
innocent
chance
to
lend
a
hand
and
proceeded
to
make
herself
as
attractive
as
possible
while
doing
so
she
took
such
a
fancy
to
the
younger
of
the
two
a
shy
little
girl
named
mary
elliott
that
at
noon
she
found
herself
watching
for
them
to
come
out
of
their
class
so
that
she
might
take
them
under
her
wing
and
show
them
the
best
kind
of
sandwich
to
buy
at
the
as
the
three
went
out
of
the
school
building
together
they
met
a
group
of
jacquette
s
sigma
pi
sisters
with
two
more
new
girls
and
all
fell
in
together
isn
t
that
a
sigma
pi
epsilon
pin
you
have
on
mary
elliott
asked
of
jacquette
who
nodded
with
an
odd
little
ripple
of
gladness
over
her
face
marion
that
settles
it
for
me
said
mary
to
the
other
girl
settles
what
jacquette
inquired
oh
nothing
only
two
sororities
have
asked
us
to
their
spreads
this
afternoon
and
i
want
to
go
to
the
sigma
pi
epsilon
one
if
that
s
what
you
belong
well
i
should
say
so
do
i
marion
crandall
chimed
in
promptly
with
a
bold
glance
at
jacquette
which
though
it
was
meant
to
be
flattering
did
not
altogether
please
her
do
all
the
girls
that
go
to
this
school
belong
to
sororities
mary
elliott
asked
jacquette
in
a
timid
undertone
mercy
no
the
innocent
question
brought
a
smile
to
jacquette
s
face
all
the
nicest
ones
then
well
a
nice
girl
that
didn
t
make
a
sorority
would
have
a
pretty
lonesome
time
at
marston
jacquette
was
admitting
when
blanche
gross
suddenly
whirled
around
and
offered
them
hot
roasted
peanuts
from
the
bag
she
carried
jack
do
you
know
about
these
four
marys
she
asked
laughingly
you
have
two
with
you
and
i
have
two
more
here
let
me
make
you
acquainted
with
mary
barnes
from
paul
and
marie
stanwood
from
and
here
s
marion
crandall
and
mary
elliott
jacquette
responded
isn
t
that
the
funniest
thing
they
must
be
the
queen
s
maries
oh
do
you
know
that
song
said
mary
elliott
my
mother
used
to
sing
me
to
sleep
with
pretty
sad
going
to
sleep
wasn
t
it
jacquette
asked
with
a
smile
and
hummed
a
little
of
the
haunting
old
melody
yestreen
the
queen
had
four
maries
the
night
she
ll
hae
but
three
oh
little
did
my
mother
ken
the
death
i
was
to
dee
you
left
out
there
was
mary
seaton
and
mary
beaton
and
mary
carmichael
and
and
oh
girls
we
mary
b
and
mary
and
mary
and
me
i
must
be
me
mary
sure
enough
jacquette
answered
gaily
now
all
you
girls
have
to
do
is
to
fly
around
and
catch
your
but
while
the
rest
laughed
mary
elliott
surprised
her
by
nestling
closer
as
they
passed
into
the
restaurant
and
whispering
with
an
adoring
upward
glance
i
ve
caught
queen
this
was
how
it
happened
that
jacquette
began
to
be
called
the
queen
a
nickname
that
clung
to
her
from
that
day
and
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
she
was
never
seen
at
spreads
and
that
she
was
even
absent
from
the
triumphant
initiation
a
few
weeks
later
when
the
four
maries
were
all
taken
into
sigma
pi
at
once
the
new
girls
understood
that
she
was
identified
with
the
sorority
they
were
joining
and
for
some
reason
perhaps
in
the
start
a
fanciful
idea
of
being
the
queen
s
maries
they
insisted
on
choosing
her
as
their
sorority
it
was
she
who
furnished
them
with
the
thousand
and
one
little
hints
on
dress
and
manners
which
were
part
of
the
sigma
pi
education
of
new
members
and
in
return
all
the
maries
with
the
exception
perhaps
of
marion
crandall
whose
effusive
manner
never
seemed
quite
real
to
jacquette
gave
their
queen
the
confidence
of
devoted
subjects
but
of
the
four
it
was
mary
elliott
who
came
closest
after
a
little
she
fell
into
the
habit
of
bringing
her
books
day
after
day
and
studying
at
the
palace
as
the
queen
s
modest
home
was
immediately
dubbed
and
both
granville
and
his
daughter
found
themselves
growing
very
fond
of
the
gentle
girl
at
first
because
of
the
love
in
her
eyes
whenever
she
looked
at
jacquette
but
soon
because
of
her
own
dear
quiet
little
self
chapter
xii
the
real
queen
the
first
weeks
of
jacquette
s
sophomore
year
discouraged
her
after
louise
and
bobs
and
marquis
had
gone
a
blank
fell
into
her
days
all
around
her
the
sigma
pi
good
times
were
going
on
but
though
she
was
allowed
to
share
the
secrets
whenever
the
girls
remembered
to
tell
them
to
her
she
constantly
felt
herself
just
outside
the
circle
of
fun
she
had
too
much
time
to
study
and
without
the
excitement
that
had
urged
and
hurried
her
all
the
year
before
she
dragged
through
her
lessons
listlessly
the
zest
had
gone
from
everything
it
was
not
long
before
mademoiselle
s
keen
eyes
noticed
the
change
and
one
day
with
a
few
adroit
questions
she
learned
the
facts
but
is
it
a
secret
dearie
this
inactive
membership
she
asked
almost
before
jacquette
realised
that
she
had
mentioned
it
no
not
exactly
it
s
all
right
for
you
to
know
mademoiselle
but
of
course
we
don
t
care
to
have
the
other
sororities
making
capital
of
it
they
d
tell
all
the
new
girls
there
must
be
something
wrong
with
sigma
pi
or
my
people
wouldn
t
have
wanted
me
to
be
i
see
said
mademoiselle
with
an
understanding
shake
of
the
head
at
any
rate
i
m
glad
it
s
right
for
me
to
know
pet
because
it
makes
me
happy
now
about
the
lessons
did
it
ever
occur
to
you
honey
that
after
a
dear
little
girl
has
once
fallen
into
the
habit
of
pinning
her
garments
together
it
is
very
hard
for
her
to
feel
the
necessity
of
sewing
on
buttons
jacquette
looked
puzzled
this
is
what
i
mean
mademoiselle
went
on
lifting
her
shoulders
ever
so
little
and
giving
her
head
a
sprightly
toss
which
jacquette
instantly
recognised
as
her
own
i
m
a
bright
little
girl
i
m
a
clever
little
girl
it
isn
t
necessary
for
me
to
spend
time
on
my
lessons
oh
no
i
never
look
up
the
references
i
don
t
bother
with
the
grammar
my
translation
is
so
good
that
it
brings
up
my
marks
even
if
i
do
fail
on
those
stupid
old
rules
i
m
such
a
lucky
little
girl
ll
get
that
s
pinning
one
s
clothing
together
to
keep
it
from
falling
off
wait
dearie
i
haven
t
done
won
t
you
try
now
that
you
have
more
time
to
form
the
habit
of
sewing
the
buttons
on
your
lessons
no
one
could
resist
mademoiselle
when
the
pleading
tone
came
into
her
voice
and
from
that
moment
jacquette
s
inactive
membership
became
endurable
she
had
begun
to
sew
on
the
buttons
and
gradually
as
the
weeks
went
on
she
won
back
the
old
brookdale
sense
of
satisfaction
in
making
each
lesson
a
finished
piece
of
work
a
feeling
which
she
had
learned
to
regard
as
childish
during
her
freshman
year
at
marston
tia
what
makes
you
look
so
young
she
demanded
one
evening
as
she
and
aunt
sula
finished
playing
a
duet
which
ended
in
a
series
of
martial
chords
is
it
just
that
waist
you
don
t
know
what
a
dear
little
brown
ringlet
there
is
trickling
down
in
front
of
this
trickling
ringlet
your
english
teacher
would
call
that
a
vicious
misuse
of
the
verb
aunt
sula
laughed
as
she
tucked
the
ringlet
into
place
perhaps
i
look
different
because
i
m
so
happy
over
your
finding
time
for
the
music
again
i
feel
as
if
somebody
had
given
me
back
my
brookdale
brookdale
jacquette
repeated
with
an
odd
little
smile
as
she
hunted
through
a
pile
of
music
that
makes
me
think
of
margaret
howland
she
asked
me
right
out
this
morning
why
i
wasn
t
going
to
spreads
and
things
so
i
had
to
tell
her
in
confidence
that
i
was
inactive
for
this
year
guess
what
she
oh
how
i
do
envy
you
aunt
sula
hazarded
roguishly
no
sir
she
said
for
goodness
sake
not
to
let
her
mother
hear
of
it
or
she
d
surely
be
made
to
do
the
same
oh
howland
has
her
troubles
troubles
if
you
think
sigma
pi
makes
troubles
you
ought
to
have
a
little
experience
with
the
kappa
delts
they
ve
been
just
themselves
in
their
rushing
this
fall
it
s
spreads
every
other
minute
and
matinees
and
automobile
rides
and
bunches
of
violets
for
their
pledges
and
everything
else
you
can
think
of
the
worst
of
it
for
margaret
is
that
she
s
the
kind
of
girl
that
tries
to
keep
up
her
studies
besides
you
know
and
i
can
t
help
seeing
myself
that
she
s
just
worn
too
bad
don
t
you
think
you
might
coax
her
to
be
inactive
never
in
the
world
you
ought
to
have
heard
her
pity
me
this
morning
she
s
a
dandy
girl
though
i
was
thinking
that
if
she
d
only
happened
to
be
a
sigma
pi
she
and
i
would
have
had
such
fine
times
together
all
through
high
school
here
s
that
duet
i
was
looking
for
we
haven
t
played
it
for
ages
let
s
try
next
morning
when
jacquette
reached
school
she
found
an
unusual
buzz
of
excitement
outside
the
building
newspapers
were
fluttering
everywhere
and
knots
of
boys
and
girls
were
standing
about
each
group
with
heads
close
together
over
some
intensely
interesting
article
that
they
were
reading
the
sigma
pi
girls
were
gathered
near
the
school
entrance
and
as
jacquette
came
up
mamie
coolidge
thrust
a
paper
under
her
eyes
see
that
she
ordered
pointing
to
the
tall
headlines
board
of
education
scores
against
secret
societies
they
ve
got
our
injunction
set
aside
jack
blanche
gross
hurried
to
explain
without
waiting
for
jacquette
to
read
the
rest
so
now
they
can
enforce
that
horrid
rule
against
secret
societies
and
they
re
going
to
do
it
and
do
you
realise
what
it
means
right
here
in
sigma
pi
no
sorority
girl
can
hold
a
class
office
any
more
that
makes
etta
give
up
the
secretaryship
of
the
junior
class
and
it
takes
blanche
out
of
the
senior
dramatics
that
s
worse
etta
broke
in
and
flo
burton
off
the
team
blanche
took
it
up
again
and
as
for
football
the
marston
eleven
will
simply
go
to
smash
nearly
every
fellow
on
it
is
a
fraternity
oh
it
will
kill
this
school
that
s
all
mamie
coolidge
declared
it
may
not
make
so
much
difference
in
schools
where
there
aren
t
so
many
secret
societies
and
of
course
we
ll
get
another
injunction
very
soon
but
in
the
meantime
marston
high
will
suffer
more
than
we
will
that
s
one
sure
that
s
the
tardy
bell
girls
cried
somebody
just
then
and
before
jacquette
could
learn
any
more
the
newspaper
was
furled
and
they
all
went
hurrying
to
their
places
as
she
reached
her
desk
she
noticed
mary
elliott
looking
at
her
with
swollen
eyes
from
across
the
aisle
a
minute
later
mary
reached
over
and
laid
a
scrap
of
paper
on
jacquette
s
desk
on
it
was
scrawled
the
two
lines
yestreen
the
queen
had
four
maries
the
night
she
ll
hae
but
what
do
you
mean
jacquette
scribbled
beneath
the
words
and
handed
the
paper
back
but
instead
of
answering
mary
put
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
and
began
to
cry
jacquette
watched
her
in
bewilderment
had
she
offended
her
without
knowing
it
then
the
soft
penetrating
voice
of
mademoiselle
calling
her
name
from
the
roll
brought
her
back
to
duty
and
she
faced
about
with
a
start
as
soon
as
the
noon
hour
came
jacquette
followed
mary
into
the
hall
what
is
it
mary
what
do
you
mean
she
asked
haven
t
you
seen
the
morning
paper
why
yes
but
oh
it
s
different
with
you
your
family
understands
but
you
ought
to
have
seen
how
angry
my
father
was
when
he
read
that
angry
at
the
board
do
you
mean
oh
no
it
was
the
first
he
had
ever
heard
about
the
secret
societies
getting
that
injunction
against
the
board
and
he
said
it
was
an
piece
of
insolence
and
that
he
should
think
every
boy
and
girl
connected
with
it
would
have
been
expelled
and
that
he
felt
disgraced
to
see
me
wearing
this
pin
and
he
wasn
t
going
to
have
a
daughter
of
his
belonging
to
an
organisation
that
was
in
antagonism
to
the
school
authorities
and
but
mary
didn
t
you
tell
him
there
was
no
such
thing
as
resigning
from
sigma
pi
oh
i
did
mary
had
shrunk
back
into
a
dark
corner
of
the
hall
where
she
could
mop
her
eyes
without
being
noticed
i
told
him
i
d
have
to
be
expelled
from
the
sorority
and
that
would
disgrace
me
before
the
whole
school
and
everything
else
but
nothing
made
any
difference
he
says
the
disgrace
is
in
belonging
to
such
a
society
he
s
given
me
three
days
to
make
up
my
mind
to
leave
sigma
pi
of
my
own
accord
and
if
i
haven
t
done
it
then
i
think
he
s
going
to
make
me
oh
jacquette
mary
began
to
sob
again
i
haven
t
any
mother
you
know
there
s
just
a
you
poor
little
thing
said
jacquette
drawing
mary
s
arm
through
hers
protectingly
here
take
my
handkerchief
yours
is
soaking
wet
there
now
come
out
in
the
air
and
eat
some
luncheon
i
m
thinking
of
something
that
i
believe
will
comfort
you
but
i
can
t
tell
you
about
it
just
yet
i
wouldn
t
say
much
to
the
other
girls
until
you
ve
heard
my
plan
just
stop
worrying
until
can
t
you
please
you
must
you
know
if
the
queen
says
oh
but
i
can
t
bear
being
expelled
and
having
the
girls
not
like
me
jacquette
will
you
have
to
turn
against
me
will
i
have
to
give
up
being
one
of
the
queen
s
maries
i
should
say
not
jacquette
declared
with
a
sudden
sense
of
shame
as
she
recognised
her
own
old
fears
in
mary
s
panic
you
leave
the
whole
thing
to
oh
you
don
t
know
my
father
mary
protested
but
she
dried
her
tears
and
smiled
in
spite
of
herself
as
she
followed
the
queen
into
the
bracing
october
air
i
hope
to
have
that
honour
some
day
jacquette
answered
roguishly
she
felt
very
motherly
and
tender
toward
this
timid
girl
who
seemed
so
easily
influenced
by
her
in
the
meantime
i
m
going
to
take
his
daughter
and
get
her
something
to
eat
where
s
marion
crandall
i
don
t
know
she
didn
t
come
to
etta
jacquette
called
just
then
as
she
and
mary
overtook
a
buzzing
group
of
sigma
pi
girls
gathered
under
a
tree
let
me
see
that
paper
won
t
you
i
didn
t
get
a
chance
to
read
it
before
this
is
the
afternoon
paper
there
s
something
worse
yet
now
isn
t
that
perfectly
shameful
etta
answered
excitedly
pointing
to
a
column
which
was
headed
sigma
pi
epsilon
sorority
in
mercy
jacquette
gasped
what
s
this
her
eyes
ran
hurriedly
through
the
sensational
account
of
a
deception
which
had
been
practised
at
marston
high
school
by
two
members
of
the
sigma
pi
epsilon
sorority
for
the
sake
of
getting
into
a
sorority
that
she
considered
desirable
the
article
said
a
certain
girl
who
lived
outside
of
the
district
had
given
as
her
own
the
address
of
one
of
the
members
of
the
marston
chapter
of
sigma
pi
epsilon
and
by
doing
so
had
been
admitted
to
the
school
the
names
of
both
girls
were
suppressed
but
it
was
stated
that
the
one
who
had
allowed
her
address
to
be
used
had
been
suspended
and
the
other
expelled
from
school
and
of
course
there
s
not
one
word
of
truth
in
it
all
jacquette
exclaimed
i
wish
there
weren
t
said
etta
gloomily
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
marion
crandall
is
the
girl
that
gave
bessie
bartlett
s
address
for
hers
so
that
she
could
come
to
marston
and
bess
let
her
do
it
one
of
my
maries
and
never
told
me
you
didn
t
know
it
did
you
mary
jacquette
asked
turning
to
the
girl
at
her
side
i
didn
t
jacquette
put
in
mary
barnes
nor
i
either
it
s
a
perfect
shock
to
me
said
marie
stanwood
but
jacquette
was
watching
mary
elliott
yes
i
did
mary
owned
miserable
in
her
honesty
but
it
was
before
i
knew
you
and
marion
made
me
promise
never
to
tell
she
said
it
was
no
harm
it
was
just
a
technical
rule
that
kept
her
from
coming
to
marston
because
she
lived
a
block
too
far
in
a
certain
i
knew
it
too
i
heard
marion
ask
bess
if
she
could
borrow
her
address
put
in
mamie
coolidge
avoiding
jacquette
s
eyes
but
determined
not
to
let
little
mary
elliott
take
the
blame
alone
it
didn
t
seem
wrong
to
me
at
the
time
either
it
looks
different
now
marion
said
her
father
knew
she
was
going
to
do
it
and
he
just
laughed
and
thought
it
was
cute
but
of
course
i
never
dreamed
she
was
going
to
sign
her
mother
s
name
to
her
report
card
and
then
tell
those
awful
yarns
to
jacquette
s
eyes
looked
black
instead
of
hazel
and
she
was
every
inch
the
queen
as
the
girls
fell
into
a
before
her
and
obediently
answered
her
questions
why
you
see
blanche
gross
took
up
the
story
marion
cut
a
lot
of
her
classes
the
first
few
weeks
after
she
was
initiated
sigma
pi
i
suppose
the
sorority
importance
went
to
her
head
a
little
the
way
it
does
sometimes
you
know
and
at
the
end
of
the
month
her
report
was
so
bad
that
she
got
worried
about
it
and
signed
her
mother
s
name
to
it
instead
of
taking
it
home
but
her
suspected
the
signature
and
mr
branch
wrote
a
letter
to
marion
s
mother
at
the
address
she
had
given
and
it
was
bessie
s
house
of
course
and
she
and
marion
got
the
letter
from
the
postman
and
tore
it
up
and
then
mr
branch
called
them
to
the
office
and
questioned
them
and
they
got
all
muddled
up
and
do
you
mean
they
didn
t
tell
the
truth
jacquette
demanded
well
you
know
how
bess
is
jacquette
she
never
had
a
bad
intention
in
her
life
and
she
thought
she
was
doing
the
whole
thing
for
the
sake
of
sigma
pi
don
t
you
see
marion
was
her
sigma
pi
sister
and
in
trouble
and
she
felt
that
she
just
had
to
answer
mr
branch
in
the
way
that
would
help
marion
out
but
he
saw
right
through
the
story
and
now
she
s
suspended
for
a
month
and
marion
crandall
is
expelled
and
sigma
pi
is
disgraced
and
the
kappa
delts
will
just
be
in
clover
oh
it
s
awful
jacquette
exclaimed
it
makes
me
wish
she
stopped
short
and
closed
her
lips
come
mary
she
said
gently
i
don
t
blame
you
you
made
a
mistake
and
we
all
do
that
i
want
you
to
eat
something
before
the
bell
rings
the
rest
of
you
girls
had
better
do
the
same
too
she
added
over
her
shoulder
as
she
drew
mary
along
we
can
t
live
on
from
that
moment
until
she
hurried
away
from
school
in
the
afternoon
carefully
avoiding
the
possibility
of
meeting
any
of
the
girls
a
busy
undercurrent
of
thinking
was
going
on
in
jacquette
s
mind
to
her
disappointment
when
she
reached
the
house
she
found
it
deserted
but
the
first
thing
she
did
was
to
get
the
morning
paper
and
read
all
about
the
action
of
the
board
of
education
then
after
walking
back
and
forth
through
the
empty
rooms
and
standing
at
the
window
looking
impatiently
down
the
street
she
turned
with
a
sudden
impulse
and
going
to
the
telephone
called
flo
burton
ever
since
their
memorable
interview
with
pierce
in
the
principal
s
room
jacquette
had
been
finding
out
good
qualities
in
this
girl
and
she
turned
to
her
now
in
the
hope
of
sympathy
flo
had
been
missing
from
the
council
of
sigma
pi
sisters
at
noon
and
remembering
that
flo
s
classes
were
arranged
this
year
so
that
she
went
home
before
luncheon
jacquette
thought
there
might
be
a
chance
of
finding
her
there
now
though
she
knew
that
most
of
the
girls
had
probably
flocked
to
the
sorority
rooms
to
talk
things
over
flo
answered
the
telephone
and
jacquette
plunged
into
her
subject
with
the
first
words
i
want
to
talk
with
you
she
said
do
you
realise
that
we
re
in
disgrace
with
the
school
authorities
you
mean
on
account
of
marion
and
bess
of
course
that
but
i
was
thinking
just
now
about
what
the
board
has
done
seems
to
me
all
fraternities
and
sororities
are
in
disgrace
from
now
on
with
this
rule
in
force
shutting
us
out
from
all
the
school
honours
and
but
jacquette
willard
came
in
a
scandalised
tone
surely
you
can
t
mean
you
d
turn
traitor
to
sigma
pi
for
the
sake
of
holding
a
class
office
turn
traitor
no
i
m
not
thinking
about
offices
but
you
know
yourself
that
the
boys
are
planning
to
collect
more
money
and
fight
the
board
again
and
doesn
t
it
seem
to
you
flo
that
it
s
a
question
now
of
deciding
between
our
sorority
and
our
school
but
jack
flo
answered
with
tears
in
her
voice
surely
you
ll
right
there
was
something
so
childishly
in
this
appeal
that
jacquette
smiled
and
as
she
did
so
she
realised
for
the
first
time
that
she
herself
had
almost
outgrown
flo
s
tragic
view
but
she
understood
that
view
too
well
to
make
the
mistake
of
laughing
at
it
aren
t
there
two
sides
florrie
she
coaxed
oughtn
t
we
to
have
a
little
of
the
same
feeling
toward
marston
that
college
students
have
when
they
talk
about
their
alma
mater
aren
t
hurting
marston
came
the
retort
it
s
that
horrid
old
board
that
has
spoiled
the
team
and
everything
it
s
just
a
case
of
oh
flo
why
i
don
t
see
what
else
the
board
could
do
if
it
wanted
to
discourage
secret
societies
it
can
t
forbid
our
joining
them
you
see
if
our
fathers
and
mothers
let
us
but
perhaps
it
can
manage
to
make
them
unpopular
by
this
make
itself
unpopular
i
guess
you
see
here
flo
jacquette
asked
abruptly
i
want
you
to
tell
me
something
if
i
should
decide
to
give
up
sigma
pi
would
it
break
our
friendship
what
a
question
it
would
have
to
of
course
do
you
suppose
if
it
really
came
to
choosing
between
sigma
pi
and
you
it
would
take
me
a
minute
to
decide
but
you
ll
never
do
such
a
thing
you
re
teasing
no
i
m
not
teasing
jacquette
said
in
a
disappointed
voice
and
after
a
few
minutes
more
of
fruitless
discussion
she
hung
up
the
receiver
and
sat
thinking
miss
jacquette
said
mollie
the
maid
putting
her
head
in
at
the
door
the
woman
that
sews
for
your
auntie
is
here
and
wants
to
speak
to
bring
her
into
the
library
mollie
jacquette
answered
and
with
her
thoughts
still
on
the
talk
with
flo
she
listened
to
the
dressmaker
s
errand
and
asked
her
to
be
seated
until
miss
granville
should
come
in
glad
to
do
it
i
m
sure
waller
agreed
as
she
put
back
the
floating
brown
veil
which
covered
her
shabby
turban
and
settled
herself
comfortably
i
m
glad
of
the
rest
i
ve
walked
about
fifteen
blocks
to
see
your
aunt
and
now
she
s
not
here
just
home
from
school
aren
t
you
my
dear
go
to
marston
say
there
s
plenty
of
excitement
over
there
i
guess
one
of
those
sororities
got
into
print
didn
t
it
well
i
think
they
re
a
dreadful
bad
thing
for
girls
what
s
that
jacquette
s
wandering
attention
was
fixed
in
an
instant
i
m
a
sorority
girl
myself
waller
she
added
rather
coldly
you
don
t
say
well
now
i
didn
t
suppose
your
aunt
would
hear
of
such
a
thing
she
s
so
sensible
as
a
general
rule
but
of
course
they
re
not
all
off
one
piece
and
yours
may
be
better
than
most
this
one
that
s
in
disgrace
now
is
about
the
worst
from
what
i
hear
i
sew
for
one
of
the
teachers
over
there
and
that
s
how
i
come
to
know
so
much
about
it
she
s
good
friends
with
the
principal
herself
so
she
gets
things
straight
and
she
tells
me
those
sigma
something
girls
whatever
it
is
had
a
pretty
bad
name
with
the
faculty
before
this
thing
happened
they
toss
their
heads
at
rules
and
all
that
you
but
that
isn
t
true
waller
jacquette
protested
her
sigma
pi
spirit
bristling
like
a
porcupine
i
d
like
to
know
which
teacher
made
that
remark
the
sigma
pi
girls
are
as
nice
a
set
as
there
is
in
school
any
sorority
is
liable
to
make
a
mistake
and
take
in
the
wrong
kind
of
a
member
once
in
a
while
and
then
trouble
may
come
of
it
of
course
but
that
s
no
reason
to
think
the
rest
are
all
bad
well
there
now
my
dear
don
t
get
excited
i
really
couldn
t
mention
the
name
of
the
teacher
that
told
me
twouldn
t
be
right
but
she
knows
the
facts
i
didn
t
dream
you
had
friends
among
those
girls
it
s
real
too
bad
for
them
isn
t
it
i
mean
the
nice
ones
that
is
if
there
are
any
nice
ones
as
you
say
for
of
course
poor
tray
is
known
by
the
company
he
keeps
don
t
you
know
the
postman
s
ring
at
the
door
just
then
gave
jacquette
an
excuse
to
get
away
without
answering
and
she
walked
out
into
the
hall
startled
by
the
tumult
of
indignation
which
waller
s
words
had
roused
within
her
that
s
the
way
it
would
always
be
if
i
should
give
up
sigma
pi
she
thought
to
herself
at
school
they
would
think
i
was
queer
and
outside
of
school
people
would
just
shake
their
heads
and
say
what
a
wicked
set
those
sorority
girls
must
be
because
jacquette
willard
had
to
cut
loose
from
them
nobody
would
ever
it
s
a
letter
for
you
miss
that
s
all
he
brought
said
mollie
turning
back
from
the
door
which
she
had
opened
and
as
jacquette
took
the
envelope
she
recognised
the
big
honest
handwriting
of
bobs
drake
for
a
minute
sorority
troubles
were
forgotten
and
a
pleased
smile
replaced
the
worried
look
while
jacquette
dropping
down
on
the
hall
bench
opened
her
letter
and
began
to
read
the
first
few
pages
were
full
of
college
news
and
nonsense
and
the
dimples
played
in
her
cheeks
then
the
tone
changed
jack
i
hope
you
won
t
think
i
m
turning
preacher
bobs
wrote
but
there
s
something
on
my
chest
that
i
wanted
to
say
before
i
came
away
and
i
didn
t
have
the
sand
it
s
about
the
way
you
fell
down
on
that
sorority
jacquette
s
eyebrows
lifted
i
say
fell
down
because
inactive
membership
isn
t
the
same
as
what
you
planned
to
do
by
a
long
sight
and
here
s
the
point
if
it
isn
t
good
for
you
to
be
an
active
member
of
a
sorority
why
is
it
good
for
other
girls
your
health
isn
t
so
much
more
delicate
you
don
t
require
so
much
more
time
for
your
lessons
than
the
general
run
of
girls
of
course
they
can
t
all
be
inactive
as
you
are
now
and
escape
the
bad
effects
of
the
thing
that
way
and
yet
by
wearing
your
pin
and
keeping
your
position
more
or
less
of
a
secret
you
re
all
the
time
influencing
other
girls
to
get
into
the
very
things
that
you
made
up
your
mind
it
was
best
for
you
to
get
out
of
what
you
write
about
the
four
maries
for
instance
especially
that
little
one
you
like
so
much
makes
it
plain
that
you
have
a
great
influence
with
some
of
the
girls
i
would
have
said
all
this
before
i
left
only
i
didn
t
like
to
disturb
you
when
you
were
so
happy
about
the
arrangement
you
had
made
with
the
girls
but
i
have
a
teacher
here
the
finest
man
i
ever
knew
and
talking
with
him
about
some
other
things
got
me
to
feeling
that
i
was
a
coward
unless
i
gave
you
straight
goods
on
this
the
fact
is
jack
things
that
seemed
mighty
important
in
high
school
begin
to
dwindle
when
you
get
to
college
especially
if
you
have
the
luck
to
know
a
man
like
prescott
i
ll
tell
you
more
about
him
when
i
see
you
always
the
same
old
p
i
had
a
letter
from
clarence
mullen
the
second
since
i
ve
been
here
you
d
be
surprised
to
read
it
that
military
school
is
a
fine
thing
for
him
r
jacquette
s
hands
with
the
letter
in
them
fell
into
her
lap
things
were
happening
strangely
what
going
waller
she
said
with
a
start
as
the
dressmaker
appeared
in
the
hall
buttoning
her
coat
about
her
yes
my
dear
i
m
rested
now
and
it
may
be
a
long
time
before
your
aunt
comes
in
i
think
i
ll
just
run
along
and
phone
her
this
as
waller
went
down
the
steps
old
granville
came
up
supporting
himself
with
his
cane
now
grandpa
granville
jacquette
reproached
him
lovingly
as
she
drew
him
to
his
easy
chair
and
sat
down
on
a
stool
at
his
side
didn
t
you
say
i
was
your
cane
and
that
you
couldn
t
take
walks
without
me
what
made
you
go
before
i
got
home
he
smiled
at
her
tenderly
it
wasn
t
fair
he
admitted
brushing
back
her
soft
bright
hair
and
this
cane
doesn
t
compare
with
the
gold
one
either
but
i
was
restless
my
dear
i
was
restless
sula
had
to
go
out
and
i
got
to
i
know
why
jacquette
murmured
laying
her
cheek
against
his
shoulder
you
were
bothered
by
those
articles
about
sigma
pi
in
the
paper
you
ve
seen
them
then
yes
indeed
it
s
the
only
topic
there
is
over
at
school
did
tia
feel
bad
he
nodded
then
he
asked
solemnly
was
it
true
dear
that
any
of
our
sorosis
did
those
dishonest
things
our
sorosis
oh
grandpa
you
darling
jacquette
exclaimed
between
laughing
and
tears
who
cares
if
you
do
call
it
sorosis
as
long
as
you
say
our
that
way
yes
it
was
true
but
it
isn
t
quite
so
bad
as
it
looks
in
the
paper
you
see
in
the
first
place
we
made
a
mistake
when
we
initiated
marion
crandall
we
didn
t
take
time
to
know
her
well
enough
we
were
too
anxious
to
get
more
new
members
than
the
kappa
delts
that
was
the
trouble
but
she
s
expelled
from
marston
so
she
s
out
of
sigma
pi
and
as
for
bess
bartlett
she
just
didn
t
realise
that
she
was
doing
anything
wrong
at
all
i
know
how
she
is
she
s
a
nice
girl
but
granville
sighed
without
answering
here
s
a
letter
from
bobs
drake
jacquette
went
on
with
determined
cheerfulness
i
want
you
to
hear
something
he
and
she
read
aloud
what
bobs
had
written
about
her
inactive
membership
as
she
finished
her
grandfather
lifted
his
white
head
and
looked
her
straight
in
the
eyes
well
he
asked
well
she
answered
steadily
i
was
trying
to
keep
it
to
tell
tia
first
but
you
re
so
blue
i
think
she
d
want
me
to
here
they
are
girls
a
bright
voice
cried
just
then
and
aunt
sula
still
in
her
outdoor
wraps
walked
into
the
library
followed
by
mary
barnes
and
marie
stanwood
and
mary
elliott
i
found
three
forlorn
girls
outside
jacquette
trying
to
make
up
their
minds
whether
they
should
come
in
or
not
so
i
brought
them
with
i
was
afraid
you
wouldn
t
want
to
see
us
because
you
didn
t
wait
for
me
to
walk
home
with
you
mary
elliott
explained
crossing
the
room
to
jacquette
of
course
i
want
to
see
you
jacquette
answered
slipping
one
arm
around
her
don
t
i
always
want
to
see
my
maries
sit
down
girls
she
added
as
aunt
sula
motioning
them
to
chairs
took
one
herself
but
the
girls
glanced
at
granville
and
his
daughter
it
s
about
sigma
pi
marie
stanwood
hinted
mysteriously
talk
it
right
out
before
grandpa
and
aunt
sula
said
mary
elliott
with
unusual
decision
and
she
glanced
lovingly
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
relatives
she
had
adopted
in
the
speech
it
s
all
about
me
and
i
want
to
know
what
they
so
while
jacquette
stood
by
her
grandfather
s
chair
with
one
arm
round
mary
s
waist
marie
stanwood
told
them
of
elliott
s
stern
decree
and
went
on
to
present
the
reasons
why
it
was
too
much
to
expect
that
mary
should
obey
him
we
ve
been
to
miss
billings
my
latin
teacher
she
said
and
she
thinks
no
father
would
ask
such
a
thing
of
his
daughter
if
he
knew
what
it
meant
she
belongs
to
a
college
sorority
herself
but
she
s
fair
to
both
sides
she
says
a
high
school
sorority
probably
does
sway
a
girl
away
from
study
toward
society
and
if
she
had
a
daughter
she
d
try
to
keep
her
out
of
such
things
until
she
went
to
college
but
she
thinks
the
getting
out
after
you
re
once
in
is
a
different
matter
a
girl
that
would
turn
against
her
sorority
this
is
just
what
she
said
would
be
despised
and
boycotted
by
the
whole
school
as
much
by
the
and
crowds
as
by
the
others
and
we
girls
think
jacquette
she
concluded
that
you
can
talk
the
best
of
any
of
us
and
that
if
you
d
just
go
to
mary
s
father
and
tell
him
how
things
are
at
marston
he
d
feel
differently
what
do
you
say
jacquette
s
hand
stole
down
into
her
grandfather
s
and
she
drew
mary
closer
then
she
spoke
with
a
sweet
womanly
ring
in
her
voice
i
m
glad
you
came
girls
i
was
just
going
to
tell
my
grandfather
something
that
i
d
like
to
say
before
all
of
you
i
ve
made
up
my
mind
that
the
board
is
right
that
we
d
all
be
better
off
without
sororities
and
i
don
t
think
i
ought
to
hide
that
belief
behind
inactive
membership
another
day
i
m
going
to
tell
the
girls
and
give
up
my
place
in
sigma
pi
once
for
all
mary
will
you
be
afraid
to
come
with
me
she
asked
smiling
down
into
the
upturned
face
which
had
suddenly
grown
luminous
now
tia
don
t
you
look
sorry
this
time
when
you
want
to
be
glad
she
went
on
turning
to
aunt
sula
it
isn
t
tragic
the
way
it
was
before
then
i
was
doing
it
because
you
thought
it
was
right
but
now
i
know
it
s
right
myself
and
i
m
happy
about
it
too
why
even
if
the
girls
decide
that
they
ll
have
to
dishonourably
expel
mary
and
me
i
guess
we
can
stand
it
as
long
as
we
know
we
re
doing
right
bravo
cried
old
granville
bringing
his
cane
down
on
the
floor
while
jacquette
with
a
shining
face
caught
aunt
sula
in
her
arms
for
a
hug
and
then
turned
to
the
bewildered
girls
with
both
hands
outstretched
don
t
think
i
m
breaking
the
vows
easily
she
said
reading
the
doubt
in
their
faces
i
m
not
girls
it
s
only
because
a
bad
promise
is
better
broken
than
kept
and
even
if
you
can
t
follow
your
queen
in
this
i
know
you
ll
never
make
mary
and
me
feel
like
outcasts
when
we
see
you
at
marston
outcasts
ejaculated
quiet
mary
barnes
opening
her
lips
for
the
first
time
during
the
interview
and
speaking
up
stoutly
why
jacquette
willard
you
re
the
splendidest
girl
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
marie
i
don
t
know
how
you
feel
but
i
m
going
to
follow
the
queen
a
little
later
as
three
loyal
maries
started
down
the
steps
together
mary
elliott
lingered
to
throw
her
arms
around
jacquette
s
neck
and
whisper
happily
remember
what
i
wrote
you
this
morning
the
night
she
ll
hae
but
three
i
thought
i
was
going
to
be
the
one
left
out
and
there
it
was
poor
marion
crandall
all
the
time
chapter
xiii
christmas
isn
t
it
pretty
tia
jacquette
demanded
with
just
as
fresh
and
eager
a
note
as
if
she
had
not
asked
the
question
a
hundred
times
before
the
prettiest
one
i
ever
saw
aunt
sula
agreed
entirely
forgetting
that
she
had
ever
answered
it
until
that
minute
very
handsome
very
handsome
granville
pronounced
then
leaving
the
enthusiastic
couple
in
the
doorway
he
walked
toward
the
glittering
christmas
tree
which
loomed
at
the
other
end
of
the
brightly
lighted
room
what
s
this
bundle
down
here
under
the
branches
girls
he
asked
touching
it
with
his
cane
grandpa
granville
you
re
as
bad
as
a
little
boy
jacquette
cried
out
darting
forward
and
drawing
him
away
what
right
have
you
to
pry
into
that
package
i
d
like
to
know
sir
oh
ho
he
laughed
guiltily
casting
a
furtive
backward
glance
we
might
open
that
one
now
jacquette
and
have
it
over
no
indeed
not
till
everyone
is
here
the
very
idea
she
exclaimed
you
must
come
right
in
the
other
room
and
draw
the
curtains
that
s
the
only
way
to
keep
you
out
of
mischief
doesn
t
tia
look
beautiful
in
that
creamy
gown
grandpa
isn
t
her
dark
hair
lovely
with
it
and
don
t
you
think
it
s
pretty
waved
that
way
i
m
the
granville
s
eyes
rested
first
on
his
smiling
daughter
then
on
the
tall
girl
at
her
side
whose
snowy
muslin
gown
was
scarcely
whiter
than
the
pretty
neck
and
arms
it
bared
around
jacquette
s
throat
was
a
necklace
of
pearls
which
had
belonged
to
her
mother
and
though
she
wore
no
other
ornament
she
seemed
aglow
with
colour
for
her
lips
were
scarlet
her
cheeks
were
roses
her
eyes
had
the
sparkle
of
jewels
and
her
beautiful
hair
glittered
like
gold
under
sunlight
i
m
very
proud
of
you
both
he
said
pausing
in
the
doorway
to
attempt
a
gallant
bow
but
before
it
was
half
done
a
pair
of
soft
arms
caught
him
round
the
neck
that
s
what
you
get
for
standing
under
the
mistletoe
jacquette
explained
as
she
let
him
go
you
d
better
be
more
cautious
after
the
girls
get
here
grandpa
i
d
like
to
know
how
anyone
s
going
to
help
getting
under
it
in
this
house
he
answered
pretending
to
look
injured
as
he
glanced
up
at
the
wreaths
and
festoons
of
green
overhead
it
looks
innocent
enough
all
that
holly
and
red
christmas
bells
dangling
around
but
the
mistletoe
s
tucked
in
everywhere
i
suspect
it
s
a
trap
i
m
going
to
warn
bobs
about
it
the
minute
he
gets
warn
bobs
indeed
jacquette
repeated
laughing
back
into
his
face
you
must
remember
grandpa
that
bobs
is
terribly
grown
up
this
vacation
and
i
m
a
senior
too
you
d
better
be
careful
how
you
then
she
added
irrelevantly
i
ve
just
had
an
awful
thought
what
if
we
ve
invited
more
people
than
we
ll
have
room
for
no
danger
child
don
t
you
worry
your
grandmother
always
said
our
house
was
elastic
when
it
came
to
taking
in
friends
and
i
rather
think
sula
s
inherited
the
knack
of
making
it
it
isn
t
as
if
they
were
going
to
stay
all
night
said
aunt
sula
with
a
smile
father
do
you
remember
the
winter
we
lived
in
the
little
brown
house
how
mac
had
to
sleep
on
the
hall
couch
so
often
that
he
threatened
to
put
up
a
sign
malcolm
s
over
his
bedroom
door
do
i
granville
laughed
softly
we
gave
in
those
days
only
we
didn
t
call
them
that
did
we
but
aren
t
times
changed
jacquette
put
in
greatly
amused
think
of
uncle
mac
now
giving
up
his
splendid
room
and
sleeping
on
a
hall
couch
or
imagine
quis
doing
it
aunt
fanny
would
hold
up
her
hands
in
horror
at
the
i
ve
seen
times
since
we
came
to
channing
when
i
thought
it
might
do
quis
good
to
give
up
a
few
things
said
the
old
gentleman
thoughtfully
but
i
guess
the
boy
s
coming
out
all
right
in
spite
of
the
money
as
for
malcolm
it
hasn
t
hurt
him
a
bit
he
s
the
same
good
boy
at
heart
that
he
always
speaking
of
angels
there
he
is
now
jacquette
exclaimed
no
it
isn
t
uncle
mac
either
she
added
as
she
flung
the
front
door
wide
open
and
peered
out
into
the
snowy
night
it
s
someone
in
a
closed
carriage
why
tia
it
s
howland
would
she
come
away
and
leave
margaret
probably
margaret
made
her
do
it
but
she
told
me
yesterday
that
the
worst
thing
typhoid
fever
had
done
to
her
next
to
putting
off
her
graduation
was
keeping
her
away
from
our
christmas
party
why
look
who
s
that
who
it
it
s
a
christmas
surprise
for
you
said
aunt
sula
as
howland
led
a
little
figure
into
the
hall
it
s
margaret
it
s
margaret
oh
how
beautiful
jacquette
cried
on
with
joy
as
she
tried
to
unwind
the
veils
and
shawls
that
margaret
s
anxious
mother
had
wrapped
her
in
i
never
dreamed
the
doctor
would
let
you
come
out
at
night
i
didn
t
think
you
were
strong
enough
yet
margaret
she
broke
off
as
she
actually
found
her
friend
at
last
inside
all
the
muffling
you
look
like
a
doll
your
eyes
are
so
big
and
that
short
curly
hair
you
darling
oh
why
can
t
we
all
look
as
sweet
as
that
and
go
to
parties
in
pink
wrappers
there
let
her
go
aunt
sula
interposed
they
were
all
laughing
but
the
tears
were
near
the
surface
for
each
one
was
remembering
that
margaret
had
been
close
to
the
gate
of
death
in
the
long
hard
weeks
just
past
we
ll
put
her
in
this
and
have
her
mother
stand
guard
over
her
the
doctor
said
we
might
keep
her
for
an
hour
or
two
if
we
d
be
very
careful
of
will
he
mind
my
hugging
her
every
few
minutes
jacquette
asked
anxiously
i
m
so
glad
so
glad
you
re
here
margaret
she
whispered
making
sure
of
one
more
hug
on
the
instant
the
evening
couldn
t
have
been
perfect
without
there
was
no
need
for
margaret
to
answer
in
words
even
if
she
could
have
found
a
chance
her
happiness
was
shining
in
her
face
while
her
mother
and
aunt
sula
and
jacquette
generaled
by
old
granville
all
bustled
about
lining
the
deep
chair
with
pillows
and
tucking
the
little
convalescent
in
among
them
when
she
was
seated
they
spread
a
thick
fleecy
white
shawl
over
her
knees
like
a
laprobe
there
but
we
won
t
cover
up
her
pretty
pink
slippers
jacquette
declared
slipping
a
hassock
under
margaret
s
feet
at
least
we
must
let
the
toes
peep
out
so
or
i
know
she
won
t
have
a
bit
good
time
jack
you
tease
margaret
protested
but
she
gave
a
contented
little
ripple
of
laughter
as
she
leaned
back
among
the
pillows
hark
she
added
isn
t
that
your
uncle
mac
s
voice
jacquette
flew
out
into
the
hall
to
see
and
from
that
minute
the
bell
kept
ringing
until
the
rooms
were
filled
with
happy
laughing
chattering
people
the
atmosphere
seemed
charged
with
secrets
and
surprises
that
were
in
danger
of
going
off
at
any
instant
and
jacquette
s
eyes
grew
bigger
and
brighter
and
darker
with
every
guest
she
greeted
at
last
a
peculiar
series
of
rings
brought
her
dancing
downstairs
from
the
room
where
she
had
just
left
a
bevy
of
girls
removing
their
wraps
that
s
quis
i
know
his
ring
she
cried
as
she
came
i
must
be
there
to
open
the
door
this
time
but
when
she
had
opened
it
she
saw
instead
of
quis
a
vision
in
a
long
pale
blue
party
cloak
and
after
one
astonished
look
at
its
laughing
eyes
and
rosy
red
cheeks
she
opened
both
arms
with
a
cry
of
delight
louise
markham
oh
joy
uncle
mac
said
your
train
was
and
you
might
not
get
in
before
so
it
was
but
we
made
up
time
and
wired
again
later
louise
explained
merrily
as
she
emerged
from
jacquette
s
embrace
your
uncle
was
bound
to
make
a
christmas
surprise
of
us
that
s
all
us
we
of
course
quis
was
on
the
same
train
with
you
where
s
he
freezing
in
a
dark
corner
until
you
remember
to
ask
for
me
was
the
prompt
response
and
a
tall
figure
stepped
into
the
light
of
the
doorway
oh
quis
quis
goody
ask
for
you
didn
t
i
fly
to
the
door
because
i
knew
your
ring
never

snow
on
your
feet
come
in
she
cried
drawing
them
both
into
the
bright
warm
house
uncle
mac
you
sinner
she
added
in
the
next
breath
as
he
came
out
into
the
hall
his
big
face
beaming
you
made
me
think
they
couldn
t
get
here
but
i
ll
forgive
you
now
tia
here
s
this
darling
louise
after
all
and
only

at
our
splendid
quis

reach
up
to
kiss
him
come
louise
a
lot
of
the
girls
are
upstairs
the
white
dress
and
blue
cloak
disappeared
up
the
stairway
together
and
the
lively
sounds
that
floated
down
a
minute
later
faintly
suggested
the
reception
that
was
going
on
above
blanche
and
etta
and
mamie
and
flo
had
all
rushed
at
louise
together
while
jacquette
hovered
round
the
edges
too
happy
for
words
while
the
exclaiming
and
the
hugging
were
still
at
their
height
something
called
her
away
and
a
little
later
she
appeared
on
the
threshold
of
the
room
just
long
enough
to
say
i
ll
have
to
go
down
girls
come
whenever
you
re
ready
sh
blanche
gross
was
whispering
to
louise
as
jacquette
turned
away
she
s
so
excited
she
hasn
t
noticed
yet
don
t
say
a
word
until
she
does
we
planned
it
for
a
christmas
illustration
last
a
peculiar
series
of
rings
brought
her
dancing
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
jacquette
came
suddenly
on
the
three
maries
trying
to
conceal
a
bulky
hatbox
as
they
caught
sight
of
her
what
s
that
girls
shan
t
i
take
it
she
inquired
with
gleeful
innocence
no
thank
you
marie
stanwood
answered
emphatically
thrusting
the
box
behind
her
where
s
your
aunt
sula
oh
a
thousand
pardons
jacquette
apologised
with
a
mischievous
laugh
tia
you
re
needed
then
on
she
went
in
search
of
quis
beckoning
him
as
soon
as
she
caught
his
eye
to
follow
her
into
the
empty
quis
she
began
breathlessly
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
together
there
s
one
thing
i
m
nervous
about
because
i
don
t
know
how
you
ll
take
it
please
promise
that
you
ll
be
all
right
before
i
tell
you
please
how
could
i
help
it
fairy
princess
he
answered
smiling
and
as
he
spoke
his
thoughts
and
hers
flew
back
to
the
night
when
he
had
met
his
brookdale
cousin
at
the
train
more
than
three
years
before
i
ll
promise
anything
you
oh
thank
you
it
s
well
you
know
little
mary
elliott
the
girl
i
like
so
much
she
and
her
father
moved
here
last
fall
and
only
lately
i
ve
found
out
the
most
surprising
thing
clarence
mullen
is
some
sort
of
a
cousin
of
well
well
this
she
hurried
on
clarence
s
father
and
mother
are
abroad
this
year
and
he
s
spending
the
holidays
with
mary
and
her
father
and
i
just
had
to
invite
him
and
really
quis
you
don
t
know
how
that
boy
has
improved
he
stands
up
as
straight
in
his
uniform
and
it
s
just
as
becoming
and
he
acts
so
gentlemanly
if
you
only
could
forgive
him
and
be
nice
to
him
marquis
s
laugh
interrupted
right
there
forgive
he
echoed
do
you
s
pose
i
m
holding
that
baby
grudge
all
this
time
not
much
besides
i
always
knew
in
my
heart
that
daddy
branch
was
right
in
putting
the
blame
for
that
thing
on
us
older
fellows
of
course
i
ll
be
nice
to
him
by
the
way
jack
has
bobs
come
he
broke
off
cutting
her
thanks
short
with
the
question
no
not
not
yet
won
t
he
be
here
this
evening
oh
yes
of
course
you
meant
had
he
come
to
town

came
yesterday
he
s
been
here
nearly
all
day
helping
me
trim
the
oh
ho
telephoned
you
from
the
station
i
suppose
as
soon
as
his
train
struck
channing
how
did
you
know
she
demanded
and
then
the
colour
flew
to
her
face
as
marquis
laughed
delightedly
but
you
re
on
the
wrong
track
quis
she
added
recovering
herself
in
a
flash
just
wait
till
you
see
who
s
coming
here
with
him
if
you
want
to
know
the
one
he
really
pooh
who
is
it
he
asked
his
laugh
subsiding
into
an
incredulous
grin
oh
the
blindness
of
some
people
why
he
always
admired
her
at
marston
and
they
ve
been
corresponding
regularly
ever
since
he
went
to
tech
she
thinks
the
world
of
him
she
told
me
marquis
was
honestly
curious
by
this
time
not
bess
bartlett
and
why
not
you
needn
t
speak
in
that
disgusted
tone
bess
has
changed
since
you
saw
her
that
trouble
she
got
into
just
brought
her
to
her
senses
quis
you
know
she
was
always
bright
enough
only
she
didn
t
care
and
when
she
found
herself
suspended
that
time
things
looked
serious
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
you
ought
to
see
the
good
work
she
s
been
doing
this
year
we
call
her
teacher
s
pet
nowadays
bess
bartlett
teacher
s
pet
say
what
is
this
occasion
jack
a
of
black
sheep
clarence
mullen
and
bess
bartlett
and
i
suppose
bess
s
reform
has
all
come
since
she
broke
loose
from
the
iniquitous
sorority
don
t
tease
about
that
quis
you
mustn
t
it
was
no
joke
for
bess
to
take
off
her
pin
i
s
pose
you
think
twas
just
foolish
there
was
a
pleading
note
in
jacquette
s
voice
and
marquis
met
it
seriously
n
no
perhaps
not
jack
i
ve
modified
my
ideas
about
that
of
course
i
think
fraternities
are
all
right
but
well
it
may
turn
out
that
sororities
aren
t
the
best
thing
in
the
world
for
girls
there
now
calm
yourself
don
t
you
begin
to
argue
that
but
it
s
so
unreasonable
i
tell
you
quis
tell
me
not
in
mournful
numbers
i
tell
you
it
s
christmas
eve
say
what
do
you
think
of
louise
stunning
beautiful
as
ever
have
you
just
discovered
her
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
tried
to
look
unconcerned
i
ve
discovered
that
bobs
drake
has
less
discrimination
than
i
gave
him
credit
for
bess
bartlett
the
smiles
broke
out
on
jacquette
s
face
again
don
t
you
worry
about
bobs
she
said
you
ll
see
that
he
s
going
to
bring
the
belle
of
the
evening
here
come
on
quis
we
mustn
t
stay
out
here
there
was
a
mystified
look
on
marquis
s
face
as
he
followed
jacquette
back
into
the
jolly
crowd
and
just
at
that
moment
he
heard
the
shout
bobs
here
s
bobs
at
last
everybody
tried
to
get
into
the
hall
at
once
while
bobs
lingered
at
the
door
to
brush
the
snow
from
the
slight
figure
at
his
side
and
marquis
following
the
others
drew
himself
to
his
full
height
and
peered
over
the
heads
and
shoulders
trying
to
discover
who
it
really
was
that
had
come
with
bobs
when
at
last
he
did
catch
a
glimpse
a
pleased
smile
broke
over
his
face
and
seeing
a
chance
at
another
doorway
he
managed
to
slip
through
to
where
jacquette
was
already
welcoming
her
guests
mademoiselle
this
is
fine
he
exclaimed
in
honest
pleasure
i
didn
t
know
you
were
coming
and
bobs
old
fellow
how
are
you
isn
t
it
great
to
be
home

under
his
breath
to
jacquette
i

with
you
young
lady
before
the
mistletoe
s
down
bess
bartlett
indeed
but
look
up
at
them
dearie
mademoiselle
was
saying
to
jacquette
in
mimic
awe
isn
t
it
wonderful
how
big
and
beautiful
they
grow
in
just
a
few
years
at
college
not
so
beautiful
as
they
grow
at
marston
in
the
same
length
of
time
bobs
answered
her
gallantly
but
mademoiselle
following
his
unconscious
glance
gave
a
teasing
smile
as
she
whispered
quite
right
lambkin
a
course
is
a
great
oh
mademoiselle
at
your
old
tricks
he
laughed
back
always
knowing
more
than
you
ve
been
told
now
then
now
then
bobs
and
marquis
came
uncle
mac
s
big
voice
from
the
parlour
doorway
no
more
time
for
falling
on
each
other
s
necks
as
soon
as
mademoiselle
is
ready
you
re
to
follow
me
into
this
room
there
s
important
business
to
margaret
howland
in
the
great
easy
chair
had
already
been
moved
into
the
room
where
the
christmas
tree
was
waiting
and
in
a
few
minutes
more
the
rest
of
the
party
had
gathered
there
it
seemed
to
old
granville
as
he
sat
in
his
comfortable
corner
near
margaret
and
watched
jacquette
flitting
about
seating
the
right
ones
together
and
making
everyone
comfortable
and
happy
that
somebody
else
besides
her
aunt
sula
had
inherited
the
knack
of
making
a
small
place
elastic
nor
were
his
the
only
pair
of
eyes
that
followed
the
gracious
little
hostess
admiringly
for
while
he
was
thinking
it
practical
aunt
fanny
was
whispering
to
her
husband
s
sister
sula
i
may
as
well
acknowledge
that
you
knew
what
you
were
doing
giving
up
her
sorority
hasn
t
cost
her
one
friend
worth
having
and
she
certainly
is
a
picture
of
health
besides
malcolm
heard
something
about
her
last
night
ladies
and
gentlemen
attention
please
uncle
mac
s
jolly
voice
broke
in
just
then
the
distribution
of
gifts
from
the
great
sparkling
glowing
christmas
tree
had
begun
and
the
first
one
to
be
presented
was
a
long
narrow
package
labelled
merry
christmas
to
the
best
grandfather
in
the
world
another
cane
to
be
used
when
i
m
at
school
another
marquis
questioned
as
he
read
the
tag
aloud
i
didn
t
know
you
had
the
first
one
but
though
jacquette
s
loving
eyes
found
her
grandfather
s
and
they
two
understood
there
was
no
chance
to
explain
to
anyone
else
in
the
midst
of
the
happy
hubbub
that
was
waxing
louder
with
every
minute
uncle
mac
as
master
of
ceremonies
was
making
a
new
hit
with
each
new
presentation
speech
and
he
kept
jacquette
and
marquis
so
busy
delivering
presents
to
the
others
that
quis
soon
turned
and
asked
clarence
mullen
to
come
and
help
them
winning
a
quick
little
glance
of
thankfulness
from
jacquette
as
he
did
so
there
were
no
great
sums
of
money
represented
in
the
surprises
on
that
tree
but
there
never
was
more
christmas
fun
tied
up
in
packages
for
a
steady
hour
the
room
was
ringing
with
laughter
and
all
the
time
nobody
seemed
to
care
in
the
least
that
scarcely
any
two
in
the
crowd
knew
what
the
next
two
were
laughing
about
at
the
same
time
behind
the
curtain
of
the
noise
there
were
tender
quiet
moments
when
eyes
looked
into
eyes
and
two
people
were
glad
that
no
one
else
knew
one
of
these
was
when
tia
opened
the
locket
jacquette
had
given
her
and
saw
her
girl
s
face
laughing
out
another
was
when
jacquette
drew
back
into
the
shadow
of
the
great
tree
to
look
at
the
little
package
which
uncle
mac
had
slipped
into
her
hand
it
was
labelled
your
mother
s
own
girl
and
the
tears
sprang
to
her
eyes
when
she
found
a
beautiful
miniature
of
her
own
mother
at
seventeen
uncle
mac
heard
the
little
cry
she
gave
and
looking
over
her
shoulder
whispered
it
was
made
from
a
picture
i
ve
had
ever
since
i
was
a
boy
you
re
very
like
her
my
dear
very
jacquette
went
farther
into
the
shadow
after
that
and
uncle
mac
understood
bobs
found
her
there
presently
wiping
her
eyes
and
for
explanation
she
laid
the
miniature
in
his
hand
it
s
you
he
said
no
not
you
my
mother
bobs
she
told
him
and
after
that
they
looked
at
the
picture
together
without
a
word
jacquette
spoke
first
i
m
going
to
put
it
away
here
she
said
turning
to
a
cabinet
that
stood
in
the
corner
i
ll
show
it
to
tia
after
everyone
has
then
as
she
closed
the
little
drawer
on
the
precious
keepsake
a
sense
of
her
duty
as
hostess
brought
back
the
smile
to
her
face
just
peep
through
these
branches
bobs
she
said
see
what
a
pretty
picture
it
makes
how
mary
elliott
hovers
over
margaret
s
chair
she
s
always
trying
to
do
something
for
somebody
and
isn
t
margaret
like
a
wax
doll
in
that
pink
gown
poor
girl
wasn
t
it
hard
she
had
to
break
down
again
when
she
had
that
dreadful
illness
last
winter
and
had
to
go
away
she
set
her
heart
on
finishing
in
february
this
year
and
then
along
came
typhoid
fever
and
spoiled
that
was
it
too
much
sorority
jack
bobs
asked
confidentially
i
m
afraid
so
but
i
tell
margaret
there
s
one
compensation
she
and
i
can
be
graduated
together
next
june
oh
bobs
look
at
louise
and
quis
over
there
by
the
door
they
ve
forgotten
that
there
s
anyone
else
on
earth
he
seems
to
appreciate
her
more
than
ever
that
s
right
bobs
agreed
it
s
been
mighty
handy
for
him
having
her
right
over
at
wells
college
while
he
was
at
cornell
that
would
go
a
long
way
toward
keeping
a
fellow
from
being
don
t
you
wish
you
were
at
cornell
she
said
bobs
looked
down
at
her
for
a
minute
with
the
old
smile
then
he
answered
slowly
shaking
his
head
boston
and
the
united
states
mails
are
good
enough
for
oh
dear
i
fished
for
that
and
now
i
ve
caught
it
i
don
t
know
what
to
do
with
it
she
exclaimed
trying
to
laugh
away
the
queer
little
flutter
that
bobs
s
words
had
thrown
her
into
don
t
stay
behind
that
tree
any
longer
she
added
archly
over
her
shoulder
you
ll
be
lonesome
jacquette
you
re
wanted
here
called
uncle
mac
s
voice
as
she
appeared
the
girls
say
you
re
to
present
this
to
a
silence
fell
in
the
room
as
jacquette
took
the
tiny
box
from
her
uncle
and
bending
before
the
french
teacher
said
simply
to
our
dear
mademoiselle
with
the
love
of
her
little
peacocks
blanche
etta
mamie
flo
bess
the
three
maries
and
my
chickens
my
little
chickens
mademoiselle
murmured
actually
with
tears
in
her
eyes
as
jacquette
opened
the
box
and
taking
out
an
exquisite
little
necklace
clasped
it
round
mademoiselle
s
throat
but
the
next
minute
before
the
tears
were
dried
she
and
everyone
else
had
begun
to
laugh
together
for
uncle
mac
had
just
announced
impressively
to
robin
sidney
drake
from
his
friend
bud
banister
a
photographic
study
entitled
bobs
s
and
the
picture
which
was
being
passed
from
one
to
the
other
had
proved
to
be
nothing
else
than
a
small
of
the
barred
gymnasium
windows
at
marston
high
then
suddenly
when
it
was
merriest
the
laugh
faltered
there
stood
clarence
mullen
in
the
middle
of
the
room
awkward
and
uncomfortable
bud
had
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
as
his
being
there
when
he
had
planned
his
little
joke
for
an
instant
no
one
made
a
sound
then
bobs
clapped
the
younger
boy
on
the
shoulder
and
cried
out
come
on
clarence
laugh
with
us
that
s
all
past
and
gone
besides
the
did
me
a
lot
of
good
i
tell
you
boy
i
believe
it
bobs
marquis
chimed
in
taking
the
cue
we
were
all
half
crazy
that
day
a
quiet
half
hour
alone
might
have
helped
some
of
the
rest
of
us
don
t
you
say
so
mademoiselle
not
a
doubt
of
it
my
lambkin
she
agreed
so
emphatically
that
the
laugh
was
turned
on
marquis
much
to
his
own
delight
as
soon
as
his
voice
could
be
heard
he
said
once
that
would
have
crushed
me
mademoiselle
i
never
thought
to
live
to
see
the
day
when
i
shouldn
t
be
afraid
of
you
haven
t
lived
to
see
it
yet
sir
louise
markham
told
him
saucily
not
one
of
us
ever
will
i
ve
been
trembling
all
the
evening
for
fear
she
d
say
something
about
my
dearie
am
i
so
ferocious
mademoiselle
reproached
her
with
a
soft
upward
glance
oh
i
know
exactly
how
you
feel
louise
jacquette
cried
with
a
roguish
nod
haven
t
you
noticed
the
way
i
around
that
s
all
owing
to
something
mademoiselle
did
the
first
week
i
was
at
marston
i
happened
to
come
into
the
and
walk
across
the
floor
after
everyone
was
seated
and
she
just
shook
her
head
at
me
and
said
very
solemnly
as
if
she
were
talking
to
herself
and
she
so
fair
so
blonde
then
she
went
to
the
blackboard
and
wrote
the
light
girl
with
the
heavy
tread
alas
everybody
laughed
except
bobs
he
was
glancing
down
at
jacquette
s
white
slippers
and
whispering
as
if
cinderella
ever
had
a
heavy
tread
that
venomous
little
old
french
lady
mademoiselle
murmured
shaking
her
head
oh
i
deserved
it
jacquette
went
on
gaily
answering
bobs
but
looking
at
mademoiselle
that
was
mild
though
compared
with
what
you
said
to
flo
the
time
she
complained
in
class
that
her
mother
made
her
do
too
much
housework
and
didn
t
leave
her
time
to
study
her
french
do
you
remember
flo
do
i
said
flo
expressively
tell
us
flo
bud
banister
put
in
grinning
in
advance
oh
she
just
looked
me
over
calmly
and
then
said
in
her
sweetest
tone
throw
her
in
the
lake
honey
throw
her
in
the
lake
that
s
what
mothers
are
for
to
throw
in
the
lake
mr
granville
granville
mademoiselle
raised
her
voice
and
appealed
to
uncle
mac
out
of
the
gale
around
her
isn
t
it
time
for
something
else
to
happen
yes
mademoiselle
he
answered
from
the
other
end
of
the
room
lifting
his
head
from
a
whispered
consultation
with
the
three
maries
something
else
is
going
to
happen
right
away
jacquette
my
dear
will
you
stand
here
he
added
stepping
forward
and
placing
his
niece
directly
in
front
of
the
tree
as
she
stood
there
surprised
expectant
with
the
broad
green
branches
spreading
behind
her
mary
elliott
dropped
a
red
silk
cushion
on
the
floor
at
her
feet
and
jacquette
required
to
kneel
on
the
cushion
saw
the
other
maries
coming
toward
her
bearing
a
wonderful
diadem
of
gold
filagree
set
with
sparkling
rhinestones
and
suddenly
found
herself
being
crowned
queen
with
all
pomp
and
ceremony
the
room
was
absolutely
still
until
the
glittering
circlet
was
finally
placed
on
the
fair
bent
head
then
came
a
burst
of
applause
long
live
the
queen
called
somebody
vive
la
reine
cried
somebody
else
and
as
jacquette
rose
to
her
feet
everyone
took
up
the
words
together
for
one
instant
the
startled
queen
looked
at
the
doorway
but
before
she
could
fly
uncle
mac
had
stepped
forward
and
slipped
his
arm
around
her
friends
he
said
in
a
voice
very
different
from
the
rollicking
one
he
had
been
speaking
in
all
the
evening
then
he
held
up
his
right
hand
until
the
cheering
had
been
silenced
friends
he
said
again
this
act
of
devotion
to
our
little
girl
has
touched
me
deeply
i
m
glad
you
all
know
that
she
s
a
brave
little
queen
but
i
think
perhaps
you
don
t
all
know
what
i
m
going
to
tell
you
i
rode
out
from
town
last
night
with
mr
branch
your
principal
he
said
to
me
that
there
had
been
a
wonderful
revolution
of
sentiment
at
marston
in
regard
to
secret
societies
and
he
says
he
gives
the
credit
for
it
almost
entirely
to
the
personal
influence
of
one
oh
uncle
mac
jacquette
implored
but
his
arm
held
her
close
and
he
went
on
firmly
mr
branch
says
that
when
this
girl
made
up
her
mind
it
was
right
for
her
to
leave
her
sorority
she
fully
expected
all
her
friends
to
turn
against
her
they
didn
t
instead
of
that
two
or
three
of
them
went
out
with
her
on
the
spot
and
somehow
the
respect
for
her
motives
was
such
that
instead
of
dishonourably
expelling
her
and
the
others
who
withdrew
as
would
naturally
have
been
done
according
to
the
rules
of
the
organisation
it
was
agreed
to
let
them
resign
quietly
that
isn
t
all
right
here
in
our
own
little
circle
i
want
to
tell
you
the
whole
story
mr
branch
says
this
girl
has
gone
on
in
her
work
making
a
splendid
record
she
has
kept
all
her
old
friends
and
made
new
ones
and
the
result
of
her
steadfast
womanly
course
is
that
yesterday
all
the
remaining
members
of
her
old
sorority
came
to
branch
in
his
office
and
told
him
that
they
had
decided
to
disband
the
marston
chapter
of
sigma
pi
epsilon
on
account
of
the
example
set
them
by
jacquette
oh
came
a
little
gasping
cry
from
jacquette
her
face
under
the
glittering
crown
was
white
with
excitement
as
her
eyes
flew
from
blanche
to
mamie
to
flo
to
etta
not
a
sigma
pi
pin
in
sight
it
was
true
it
was
true
long
live
the
queen
of
us
all
cried
a
happy
little
treble
from
the
and
there
sat
margaret
howland
too
without
a
sign
of
a
kappa
delta
pin
on
her
pink
gown
long
live
the
rest
began
but
jacquette
s
voice
checked
them
please
please
listen
all
of
you
she
begged
with
one
white
arm
outstretched
before
her
uncle
as
if
barring
his
possible
objection

me
tell
you
how
it
was

voice
broke
suddenly
and
without
an
instant
s
warning
she
flew
across
to
her
little
aunt
sula
caught
her
in
her
arms
and
whirling
her
to
the
doorway
where
the
mistletoe
hung
thickest
kissed
her
again
and
again
the
next
minute
they
had
both
disappeared
behind
the
portieres
and
jacquette
was
whispering
tia

why

curtains

the
tall
young
queen
smiling
through
her
tears

hand
