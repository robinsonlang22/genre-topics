the
boys
of

pré

i
camp
in
the
weapons
of
an
an
old
a
mineral
tremendous
corbet
on
the
a
pot
of
the
spring
recess
was
over
and
the
boys
of
the
grand
pré
school
were
now
to
turn
from
play
to
study
the
last
day
of
their
liberty
was
spent
by
the
b
at
their
encampment
in
the
woods
they
found
it
in
so
good
a
condition
that
it
was
even
more
attractive
than
when
they
left
it
the
dam
had
proved
the
pool
was
full
to
the
brim
the
trees
overhung
with
a
denser
foliage
while
all
around
the
earth
was
covered
with
young
grass
springing
forth
with
that
rapidity
which
marks
the
growth
of
vegetation
in
these
colder
regions
it
was
early
in
the
day
when
they
came
up
and
they
were
accompanied
by
the
perpetual
grand
panjandrum
who
carried
on
his
woolly
head
a
basket
crammed
to
the
top
with
a
and
very
luxurious
lunch
which
it
had
been
the
joy
of
that
aged
functionary
to
gather

the
present
occasion

he
exclaimed

and
he
rolled
up
his
eyes
till
nothing
could
be
seen
but
the
whites
of
them
and
chuckled
all
over
and
then
with
a
face
of
mock
solemnity
bobbed
his
old
head
and
said
far
well
mos
wos
ful
an
all
de
res
ob
de
belubbed
and
with
these
words
he
departed
after
this
the
boys
gave
themselves
up
to
the
business
of
the
day
and
what
was
that
o
nothing
in
particular
but
many
things
in
general
first
and
foremost
there
was
a
grand
jubilation
to
be
made
over
the
encampment
of
the
b
then
a
grand
lamentation
over
the
end
of
the
recess
then
they
talked
over
a
thousand
plans
of
future
action
in
these
woods
there
were
no
bears
nor
were
there
any
wild
indians
but
at
any
rate
there
were
squirrels
to
be
shot
at
and
there
were
gaspereaugians
to
be
armed
against
it
was
certainly
necessary
then
that
they
should
have
arms
of
offence
and
defence
to
decide
on
these
arms
was
a
matter
that
required
long
debate
one
was
in
favor
of
clubs
another
of
chinese
crackers
a
third
had
a
weakness
for
boomerangs
a
fourth
suggested
lassos
and
a
fifth
thought
that
an
old
cannon
with
bart
s
pistol
and
the
gun
would
form
their
most
efficient
means
of
defence
but
in
the
course
of
a
long
discussion
all
these
opinions
were
modified
and
the
final
result
was
in
favor
of
the
comparatively
light
and
trifling
arms
bows
and
arrows
in
addition
to
these
whistles
were
thought
to
be
desirable
in
order
to
assist
in
decoying
the
unsuspecting
squirrel
or
in
warning
off
the
prowling
gaspereaugian
one
powerful
cause
of
their
unanimous
decision
was
the
pleasing
fact
that
bows
arrows
and
whistles
could
be
manufactured
on
the
spot
by
their
own
jackknives
ash
trees
were
all
around
from
which
they
could
shape
the
elastic
bow
tall
spruce
trees
were
there
from
which
they
could
fashion
the
light
straight
shaft
and
there
too
were
the
twigs
from
which
they
could
whittle
the
willow
whistle
it
was
jolly
was
it
not
could
anything
be
more
so
certainly
not
so
they
all
thought
and
they
gave
themselves
up
therefore
to
the
joy
of
the
occasion
they
bathed
in
the
pool
they
dressed
again
and
lay
on
the
grass
in
the
sun
they
gathered
ash
and
spruce
and
willow
they
collected
also
large
quantities
of
fresh
soft
moss
which
they
strewed
over
the
floor
of
the
camp
in
which
they
at
length
sought
refuge
from
the
sun
and
brought
out
their
knives
and
went
to
work
here
they
sat
then
working
away
like
busy
bees
two
at
bows
two
at
arrows
and
one
at
whistles
laughing
singing
talking
joking
telling
stories
and
making
such
a
general
and
indiscriminate
hubbub
as
had
never
before
been
heard
in
these
quiet
woods
when
suddenly
they
were
startled
by
a
dark
shadow
which
fell
in
front
of
the
doorway
and
instantly
retreated
followed
by
the
crackling
sound
of
dried
twigs
in
a
moment
bart
was
on
his
feet
goes
there
he
cried
in
a
loud
but
very
firm
voice
while
at
the
same
instant
the
thought
flashed
into
his
mind
and
into
the
minds
of
all
the
others
the
gaspereaugians
full
of
this
thought
they
all
arose
even
while
bart
was
speaking
with
their
souls
full
of
a
desperate
resolution
goes
there
cried
bart
a
second
time
in
still
louder
tones
a
faint
crackle
among
the
dried
twigs
was
the
only
respose
that
came
goes
there
cried
bart
a
third
time
in
a
voice
of
deadly
determination
or
i
ll
fire
at
this
menacing
and
imperative
summons
there
came
a
response
it
came
in
the
shape
of
a
figure
that
stole
forward
in
front
of
the
doorway
slowly
and
carefully
a
figure
that
disclosed
to
their
view
the
familiar
form
and
the
meek
the
mild
the
venerable
and
the
face
of
captain
corbet
greeted
with
one
universal
shout
of
joy
here

the
venerable
commander
as
he
stepped

upon

there

out
three
cheers
as
loud
and
as
vigorous
as
could
be
produced
by
the
united
lungs
of
the
five
boys
captain
corbet
regarded
them

an
amiable
smile

the
fact

on
at
this
captain
corbet
s
face
assumed
an
expression
of
deep
and
dark
mystery
he
had
a
stick
in
his
hand
about
a
yard
long
rather
slender
and
somewhat
dirty
he
now
held
out
this
stick
looked
at
it
for
a
few
moments
in
indescribable
solemnity
then
closed
his
eyes
then
shook
his
head
and
then
putting
the
stick
behind
his
back
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
looked
hard
at
the
boys
business
said
arthur
what
kind
of
business
captain
corbet
looked
all
around
with
an
air
of
furtive
scrutiny
and
then
regarded
the
boys
with
more
solemnity
than
ever
he
held
out
his
stick
again
and
regarded
it
with
profound
earnestness
it
s
a
diskivery
said
he
a
discovery
asked
bart
full
of
wonder
at
captain
corbet
s
very
singular
manner
a
discovery
what
kind
of
a
discovery
a
diskivery
continued
captain
corbet
and
this
here
stick
he
continued
holding
it
forth
this
here
stick

the
identical
individooal
article
that

diskivery

me
tain

what
that
air

guess
that
said
bart
somewhat
contemptuously
why
what
s
that
it
s
only
a
common
at
this
captain
corbet
seemed
deeply
offended
he
caressed
the
stick
affectionately
and
looked
reproachfully
at
bart
a
stick
said
he
at
last
a
common
stick
no

isn
t
a
stick
i
should
like
to
know
what
you
call
o
you
ll
know
you
ll
know
in
time
said
captain
corbet
whose
air
of
mystery
now
returned
and
made
the
boys
more
anxious
than
ever
to
find
out
the
cause
if
it
isn
t
a
stick
what
is
it
asked
bruce
wal
it
ain
t
a
stick
what
is
it
then
it
s
a
rod
said
captain
corbet
slowly
and
impressively
a
rod
well
what
then
isn
t
a
rod
a
stick
no
not
by
a
long
chalk
besides
this
here
s
a
very
pecooliar
how
s
that
captain
corbet
rose
went
to
the
door
looked
on
every
side
with
eager
scrutiny
then
returned
and
looked
mysteriously
at
the
boys
then
he
stepped
nearer
then
he
bent
down
his
head
and
finally
he
said
in
an
eager
and
piercing
whisper
s
a
mineral
rod
a
mineral
rod
yes
sir
said
captain
corbet
stepping
back
and
watching
the
boys
eagerly
so
as
to
see
the
full
effect
of
this
startling
piece
of
intelligence
the
effect
was
such
as
might
have
satisfied
even
captain
corbet
with
all
his
mystery
a
mineral
rod
what
could
be
more
exciting
to
the
imagination
of
boys
had
they
not
heard
of
such
things
of
course
they
had
they
knew
all
about
them
they
had
read
of
mineral
rods
as
they
had
read
of
other
things
they
had
feasted
their
imaginations
on
pirates
brigands
wizards
necromancers
astrologers
and
all
the
other
characters
which
go
to
make
up
the
of
a
boy
and
among
all
the
things
of
this
nothing
was
more
impressive
than
a
mineral
rod
this
was
the
magic
wand
that
revealed
the
secrets
of
the
earth
this
was
the
resistless
sesame
that
opened
the
way
to
the
hoarded
treasures
of
the
bandit
this
was
the
key
that
would
unlock
the
coffers
filled
with
gold
and
buried
deep
in
the
earth
by
the
robber
chief
or
the
pirate
captain
what
wonder
then
that
the
very
mention
of
that
word
was
enough
to
excite
them
all
in
an
instant
and
to
turn
their
minds
from
contempt
to
eager
and
irrepressible
curiosity
i
m
no
fool
said
captain
corbet
impressively

the
boys

preliminary
remarks

a
still
deeper
impression
wal
as
i
was
a
sayin
resumed
the
captain

a
prowlin
round
and
round

that
s
what
i

these
last
few
words
added
in
a
low
but
penetrating
whisper
thrilled
the
boys
with
strange
excitement
have
you
really
found
anything
asked
bart
eagerly
what
is
it
when
where
how
captain
corbet
took
off
his
hat
very
solemnly
and
then
plunging
his
hand
into
his
pocket
he
drew
forth
a
crowd
of
miscellaneous
articles
one
by
one
he
thus
brought
forth
a
button
a
knife
a
string
a
fig
of

and
very
many
other
articles
all
of
which
he
put
in
his
hat
in
a
very
grave
and
serious
manner
he
then
proceeded
with
his
other
hand
to
unload
his
other
pocket
the
contents
of
which
were
quite
as
numerous
and
as
varied
but
in
neither
of
the
pockets
did
he
find
what
he
wished
wal
i
declar
he
cried
suddenly
i
remember
now
i
put
it
in
my
waistcoat
saying
this
he
felt
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
drew
forth
a
copper
coin
which
he
held
forth
to
the
boys
with
a
face
of
triumph
bart
took
it
and
the
others
crowded
eagerly
around
him
to
look
at
it
it
was
very
much
worn
indeed
on
one
side
it
was
quite
smooth
and
the
marks
were
quite
effaced
but
on
the
other
side
there
was
a
head
and
around
it
were
letters
which
were
legible
they
read
this
louis
xiv
roi
de
france
all
of
which
sank
deep
into
their
souls
it
s
an
old
french
coin
said
bruce
at
length
where
did
you
get

did
you
find
it
yourself
captain
corbet
made
no
reply
but
only
held
up
his
mineral
rod
and
solemnly
tapped
it
did
you
find
it
with

asked
bart
the
captain
nodded
with
mysterious
and
impressive
emphasis

continued
the
captain
in
a
dreamy
and
somewhat
mournful
tone
tain
t
in
my
line
for
me
at
my
age
to
go
huntin
arter

but
then
that
babby
every
look
every
cry
every
crow
that
s
given
by
that
offsprin
tetches
my
heart
s
core
an
i
pine
to
be
a
de
win
somethin
for
him
to
smooth
the
way
for
his
infant
feet
when
poor
old
corbet
s
gone
for
i
can
t
last
long
yes
yes
i
must
do
it
for
the
every
word
that
captain
corbet
uttered
except
perhaps
his
remarks
about
the
babby
only
added
to
the
kindling
excitement
of
the
boys
a
mineral
rod
a
buried
treasure
what
could
be
more
overpowering
than
such
a
thought
in
an
instant
the
camp
in
the
woods
seemed
to
lose
all
its
attractions
in
their
eyes
to
play
at
camping
out
to
humor
the
pretence
of
being
bandits
was
nothing
compared
with
the
glorious
reality
of
actually
digging
in
the
ground
under
the
guidance
of
a
real
mineral
rod
for
a
buried
pot
of
gold
yet
it
ought
to
be
explained
that
to
these
boys
it
was
not
so
much
the
value
of
any
possible
treasure
that
might
be
buried
and
exhumed
which
excited
them
as
the
idea
of
the
enterprise
itself
an
enterprise
which
was
so
full
of
all
the
elements
of
romantic
yet
mysterious
adventure
how
tremendous
was
the
secret
which
had
thus
been
intrusted
to
them
how
impressive
was
the
sight
of
that
mineral
rod
how
overpowering
was
the
thought
of
a
pot
of
gold
buried
long
ago
by
some
fugitive
frenchman
how
convincing
was
the
sight
of
that
copper
coin
and
finally
how
very
appropriate
was
such
an
enterprise
as
this
to
their
own
secret
society
of
the
b
it
was
an
enterprise
full
of
solemnity
and
mystery
beset
with
unknown
peril
surrounded
with
secrecy
and
awe
a
deed
to
be
attempted
in
darkness
and
in
silence
an
undertaking
which
would
supply
the
b
with
that
for
which
they
had
pined
so
long
a
purpose
but
there
any
money
buried
asked
phil
money
buried
said
bart
of
course
and
lots
of
it
when
the
french
acadians
were
banished
they
couldn
t
take
their
money
away
they
must
have
left
behind
all
that
they
had
and
they
had
lots
of
it
haven
t
you
read
all
about
benedict
bellefontaine
the
wealthiest
farmer
of
grand
pré
of
course
you
have
well
if
he
was
the
wealthiest
others
were
wealthy
that
stands
to
reason
and
if
so
what
did
they
do
with
their
wealth
where
did
they
keep
their
money
they
hadn
t
any
banks
they
couldn
t
buy
stock
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
what
did
they
do
with
it
then
what
why
they
buried
it
of
course
that
s
the
way
all
people
manage
that
s
what
the
hindoos
do
and
the
persians
and
the
chinese
people
call
it
they
say
there
s
enough
gold
and
silver
buried
in
the
earth
in
india
and
china
to
pay
olf
the
national
debt
and
i
believe
there
s
enough
money
buried
about
here
by
the
old
acadians
to
buy
up
all
the
farms
of
grand
bart
spoke
earnestly
and
in
a
tone
of
deep
conviction
which
was
shared
by
all
the
others
the
copper
coin
and
the
mineral
rod
had
done
their
work
they
lost
all
taste
for
the
camp
and
its
pool
and
its
overarching
trees
and
its
seclusion
and
were
now
eager
to
be
off
with
captain
corbet
before
this
new
enterprise
even
the
greatest
of
their
recent
adventures
dwindled
into
insignificance
captain
corbet
with
his
magic
wand
stood
before
them
inviting
them
to
greater
and
grander
exploits
a
long
conversation
followed
and
captain
corbet
began
to
think
that
the
pot
of
gold
was
already
invested
the
boys
took
his
mineral
rod
which
he
did
not
give
up
until
he
had
been
for
a
long
time
coaxed
and
entreated
they
passed
it
from
hand
to
hand
each
one
closely
inspected
it
and
balanced
it
on
his
finger
so
as
to
test
the
mode
in
which
it
worked
each
one
asked
him
innumerable
questions
about
it
and
gave
it
a
long
and
solemn
trial
but
where
is
the
place
asked
bart
is
it
very
far
from
here
captain
corbet
shook
his
head
tain
t
very
far
off
said
he
i
ll
show
which
way
asked
tom
the
captain
waved
his
rod
in
the
direction
of
the
academy
what
that
way
asked
bart
are
the
cellars
there
you
don
t
mean
those
what
just
behind
the
academy
it
s
the
old
french
orchard
then
cried
bart
the
old
french
the
only
cellars
in
that
direction
are
under
the
old
french
apple
trees
on
the
top
of
the
hill
is
that
the
place
you
mean
captain
that
s
the
indentical
individool
spot
said
captain
corbet
the
old
french
orchard
exclaimed
the
other
boys
in
surprise
for
they
had
expected
to
be
taken
to
some
more
remote
and
very
different
place
wal
said
captain
corbet
that
thar
place
s
a
very
pecooliar
place
you
see
thar
s
a
lot
o
cellars
jest
thar
an
then
the
ole
apple
trees
they
re
somethin
the
ole
frenchman
that
lived
up
thar
must
hev
ben
the
fact
is
exclaimed
bart
captain
corbet
s
right
the
frenchman
that
lived
on
that
place
must
have
been
rich
for
my
part
i
believe
that
he
was
no
other
than
benedict
bellefontaine
the
wealthiest
farmer
in
grand
he
buried
all
his
money
there
no
doubt
this
is
one
of
his
french
sous
come
along
boys
we
ll
find
that
pot
of
and
with
these
words
they
all
set
out
along
with
captain
corbet
for
the
old
french
ii
old
french
the
french
the
ruined
captain
corbet
in
the
mysterious
the
mineral
bod
where
is
the
pot
of
cold
plans
projects
and
the
hill
on
which
grand
pré
academy
was
built
sloped
upwards
behind
it
in
a
gentle
ascent
for
about
a
mile
when
it
descended
abruptly
into
the
valley
of
the
gaspereaux
for
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
back
of
the
academy
there
were
smooth
cultivated
meadows
which
were
finally
bounded
by
a
deep
gully
at
the
bottom
of
this
there
ran
a
brawling
brook
and
on
the
other
side
was
that
dense
forest
in
which
the
boys
built
their
camps
here
on
the
cleared
lands
just
by
the
gully
was
the
favorite
of
the
school
happy
were
the
boys
who
had
such
a
high
up
on
the
slope
of
that
hill
it
commanded
a
magnificent
prospect
behind
and
on
either
side
were
dense
dark
woods
but
in
front
there
stood
revealed
a
boundless
scene
beneath
was
the
academy
far
down
to
the
right
spread
away
the
dike
lands
of
grand
pré
bounded
by
two
long
low
islands
which
acted
as
a
natural
barrier
against
the
turbulent
waters
and
farther
away
rose
the
dark
outline
of
horton
bluff
a
wild
precipitous
cliff
at
the
mouth
of
the
gaspereaux
river
marking
the
place
where
the
hills
advanced
into
the
sea
and
the
marsh
lands
ended
beyond
this
again
there
spread
away
the
wide
expanse
of
minas
bay
full
now
with
the
flood
tide
a
vast
sheet
of
blue
water
dotted
with
the
white
sails
of
passing
vessels
and
terminated
in
the
dim
and
hazy
distance
by
those
opposite
shores
which
had
been
the
scene
of
their
late
adventures
parrsboro
pratt
s
cove
and
the
five
islands
far
away
towards
the
left
appeared
fields
arrayed
in
the
living
green
of
opening
spring
the
wide
plains
of
cornwallis
with
its
long
reaches
of
dike
lands
separated
by
ridges
of
wood
land
and
bounded
by
the
dark
form
of
the
north
mountain
through
all
this
from
afar
flowed
the
cornwallis
river
with
many
a
winding
rolling
now
with
a
full
strong
flood
before
them
and
beyond
them
till
with
a
majestic
sweep
it
poured
its
waters
into
that
sea
from
which
it
had
received
them
finally
full
before
them
dark
gloomy
frowning
with
its
crest
covered
with
rolling
and
the
white
gleaming
at
its
base
rose
the
central
object
of
this
magnificent
scene
the
towering
cliff
blomidon
such
was
the
scene
which
burst
upon
the
eyes
of
the
boys
as
they
crossed
the
brook
and
ascended
the
other
side
of
the
gully
familiar
that
scene
was
and
yet
in
spite
of
its
familiarity
it
had
never
lost
its
attractions
to
them
and
for
a
moment
they
paused
involuntarily
and
looked
out
before
them
for
there
is
this
peculiarity
about
the
scenery
of
grand
pré
that
it
is
not
possible
for
it
to
become
familiar
in
the
common
sense
of
the
word
that
scene
is
forever
varying
and
the
variations
are
so
great
that
every
day
has
some
new
prospect
to
offer
land
sea
and
sky
all
undergo
incessant
changes
there
is
the
basin
of
minas
which
is
ever
changing
from
red
to
blue
from
a
broad
sea
to
a
contracted
strait
hemmed
in
by
mud
flats
there
is
the
sky
with
its
changes
from
deepest
azure
to
dreamy
haze
or
impenetrable
mist
there
are
rivers
which
change
from
fulness
to
emptiness
majestic
at
the
flow
of
tide
indistinguishable
at
the
ebb
there
is
blomidon
which
every
day
is
arrayed
in
some
new
robe
sometimes
at
other
times
deep
purple
now
again
and
thus
it
goes
through
innumerable
changes
from
the
pale
neutral
tints
which
it
catches
from
the
overhanging
fogs
down
through
all
possible
gradations
to
a
darkness
and
a
gloom
and
a
savage
grandeur
which
throw
around
it
something
almost
of
terror
then
come
the
seasons
which
change
the
wide
plains
from
brown
to
green
and
from
green
to
yellow
till
winter
appears
and
robes
all
in
white
and
piles
up
for
many
a
mile
over
the
shallow
shores
and
in
the
deep
channels
of
the
rivers
the
ever
accumulating
masses
of
ice
yet
all
the
time
through
all
the
seasons
while
field
and
flood
river
and
mountain
sea
and
forest
are
thus
changing
their
aspect
there
hangs
over
all
an
atmosphere
which
brings
changes
more
wonderful
than
these
the
fog
is
forever
struggling
for
an
entrance
here
the
air
in
an
instant
may
bring
forth
its
hidden
watery
vapors
high
over
blomidon
the
mist
banks
are
piled
and
roll
and
writhe
at
the
blast
of
the
winds
from
the
sea
here
the
mirage
comes
and
the
eye
sees
the
solid
land
uplifted
into
the
air
here
is
the
haze
soft
and
mysterious
as
that
of
southern
italy
which
diffuses
through
all
the
scene
an
unutterable
sweetness
and
tenderness
here
in
an
instant
a
change
of
wind
may
whirl
all
the
accumulated
mists
down
from
the
crest
of
blomidon
into
the
vale
of
cornwallis
and
force
vast
masses
of
far
up
into
the
basin
of
minas
till
mountain
and
valley
and
river
and
plain
and
sea
and
sky
are
all
alike
snatched
from
view
and
lost
in
the
indistinguishable
gray
of
one
general
fog
the
boys
then
had
not
grown
wearied
of
the
scene
every
day
they
were
prepared
for
some
fresh
surprise
and
they
found
in
this
incessant
display
of
the
glory
of
nature
with
its
variety
and
its
boundless
scope
something
which
so
filled
their
souls
and
enlarged
their
minds
that
the
perpetual
contemplation
of
this
was
of
itself
an
education
and
so
strong
was
this
feeling
in
all
of
them
that
for
a
moment
all
else
was
forgotten
and
it
was
with
an
effort
that
they
recollected
the
captain
and
his
mineral
rod
upon
this
they
turned
to
carry
out
their
purpose
in
this
place
and
close
by
where
they
were
standing
were
several
hollows
in
the
ground
which
were
well
known
to
be
the
cellars
of
houses
once
occupied
by
french
acadians
at
a
little
distance
were
a
number
of
apple
trees
still
growing
and
now
putting
forth
leaf
yet
so
old
that
their
trunks
and
branches
were
all
covered
with
moss
and
the
fruit
itself
on
ripening
was
worthless
these
trees
also
belonged
to
the
former
owners
of
the
houses
the
fallen
the
vanished
race
and
at
the
bottom
of
one
of
these
holes
captain
corbet
was
standing
solemnly
balancing
the
mineral
rod
on
one
finger
and
calling
to
the
boys
to
come
and
watch
how
it
pinted
to
the
buried
pot
of
gold
these
cellars
were
but
a
few
out
of
hundreds
which
exist
over
the
country
as
sad
memorials
of
those
poor
acadians
who
were
once
so
ruthlessly
driven
into
exile
the
beautiful
story
of
evangeline
has
made
the
sorrows
of
the
acadians
familiar
to
all
and
transformed
grand
pré
into
a
place
of
pilgrimage
where
the
traveller
may
find
on
every
side
these
sad
vestiges
of
the
former
occupants
into
this
beautiful
land
the
french
had
come
first
they
had
felled
the
forests
drained
the
marshes
and
reared
the
dikes
against
the
waters
of
the
sea
here
they
had
increased
and
multiplied
and
long
after
acadie
had
been
ceded
to
the
british
they
lived
here
unmolested
they
still
cherished
that
patriotic
love
for
france
which
was
natural
and
in
the
wars
did
not
wish
to
fight
against
their
own
countrymen
but
on
the
other
hand
they
resisted
the
french
agents
who
were
sent
among
them
to
excite
insurrection
a
few
acted
against
the
british
but
the
majority
were
neutral
at
length
the
british
enlarged
their
operations
in
acadie
sent
out
thousands
of
emigrants
and
began
to
settle
the
province
then
came
a
life
and
death
struggle
between
englishmen
and
frenchmen
which
spread
over
all
america
far
along
the
canadian
frontier
and
along
the
ohio
valley
and
southward
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
the
frenchmen
of
acadie
were
looked
on
with
suspicion
an
effort
was
soon
to
be
made
against
louisbourg
and
quebec
by
which
it
was
hoped
that
the
french
power
would
be
crushed
into
the
dust
but
the
acadians
stood
in
the
way
they
were
feared
as
being
in
league
with
the
french
and
the
indians
their
pleasant
lands
also
were
eagerly
desired
for
an
english
population
and
so
it
was
determined
to
banish
them
all
and
in
the
most
cruel
way
conceivable
ordinary
banishment
would
not
do
for
then
they
might
wander
to
canada
and
add
their
help
to
their
brethren
so
it
was
determined
to
send
them
away
and
scatter
them
over
the
coast
of
america
this
plan
was
thoroughly
carried
out
from
grand
pré
two
thousand
were
taken
away
men
women
and
children
families
were
divided
forever
the
dearest
friends
were
parted
never
to
meet
again
their
fields
were
laid
waste
their
houses
and
barns
and
churches
were
given
to
the
flames
and
now
the
indelible
traces
of
this
great
tragedy
may
be
seen
in
the
ruined
cellars
which
far
and
wide
mark
the
surface
of
the
country
far
and
wide
also
may
be
seen
their
trees
the
apple
trees
and
worn
out
and
gnarled
and
decaying
the
willow
giving
a
grateful
shade
by
the
side
of
brooks
and
the
tall
poplar
dear
to
the
old
acadian
whose
long
rows
may
be
seen
from
afar
rising
like
so
many
monuments
over
the
graves
of
an
extinct
race
where
is
the
village
the
home
of
acadian
farmers
men
whose
lives
glided
on
like
rivers
that
water
the
wood
lands
darkened
by
shadows
of
earth
but
reflecting
an
image
of
heaven
waste
are
those
pleasant
farms
and
the
farmers
forever
departed
scattered
like
dust
and
leaves
when
the
mighty
blasts
of
october
seize
them
and
whirl
them
aloft
and
sprinkle
them
far
o
er
the
ocean
nought
but
tradition
remains
of
the
beautiful
village
of
grand
pré
now
the
idea
of
the
boys
was
not
by
any
means
so
absurd
as
may
be
supposed
it
was
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
that
a
pot
of
money
might
be
in
a
french
cellar
these
acadians
had
some
wealth
they
had
been
in
the
habit
of
hoarding
it
by
burying
it
in
the
earth
and
the
bottom
of
the
cellar
was
by
no
means
an
unlikely
place
so
sudden
had
been
their
seizure
that
none
of
them
had
any
time
whatever
to
exhume
any
of
their
buried
treasure
so
as
to
carry
it
away
with
him
all
had
been
left
behind
cattle
flocks
herds
grain
houses
furniture
clothes
and
of
course
money
vague
tradition
to
this
effect
had
long
circulated
about
the
country
and
there
was
a
general
belief
that
money
was
buried
in
the
ground
where
it
had
been
left
by
the
acadians
so
after
all
the
boys
were
only
the
exponents
of
a
popular
belief
the
cellar
might
have
originally
been
five
or
six
feet
in
depth
but
the
falling
of
the
walls
and
the
caving
in
of
the
earth
had
given
it
a
shape
like
a
basin
and
the
depth
at
the
centre
was
not
more
than
four
feet
below
the
surrounding
level
around
the
edge
were
some
stones
which
marked
the
old
foundation
the
boys
came
up
to
captain
corbet
and
watched
him
quietly
yet
very
curiously
as
for
the
illustrious
captain
he
felt
to
the
utmost
the
importance
of
the
occasion
he
was
now
no
longer
the
captain
of
a
gallant
bark
he
had
become
transformed
into
a
species
of
necromancer
instead
of
the
familiar
tiller
he
held
in
his
hand
the
rod
of
the
magician
all
the
solemnity
of
such
a
position
was
expressed
in
his
venerable
features
after
throwing
a
benignant
smile
upon
the
boys
his
eyes
reverted
to
the
rod
which
was
still
balanced
on
his
finger
and
he
walked
about
with
a
slow
and
solemn
pace
to
different
parts
of
the
cellar
first
he
went
around
the
sides
stopping
at
every
third
step
and
looking
solemnly
at
the
rod
but
the
rod
preserved
its
balance
and
made
no
deflection
whatever
towards
any
place
go
down
to
the
middle
captain
said
bart
who
in
common
with
the
other
boys
had
been
watching
these
mysterious
proceedings
with
intense
curiosity
captain
corbet
shook
his
head
solemnly
and
lifted
up
his
unoccupied
hand
with
a
warning
gesture
said
tom
don
t
interrupt
him
captain
corbet
moved
slowly
about
a
little
longer
and
then
descended
to
the
middle
of
the
cavity
here
he
planted
himself
and
his
face
assumed
if
possible
an
expression
of
still
profounder
solemnity
and
now
a
strange
sight
appeared
the
rod
began
to
move
slowly
and
gradually
one
end
of
it
lowered
so
slowly
indeed
that
at
first
it
was
not
noticed
but
at
last
they
all
saw
it
plainly
for
it
went
down
lower
yet
in
that
gradual
fashion
and
the
boys
as
they
looked
became
almost
breathless
in
suspense
they
drew
nearer
they
crowded
up
closer
to
captain
corbet
and
watched
that
rod
as
though
all
their
future
lives
depended
upon
the
vibration
of
that
slender
and
rather
dirty
stick
not
a
word
was
spoken
lower
and
lower
went
the
rod
it
trembled
on
its
balance
it
quivered
on
cap
tain
corbet
s
forefinger
as
the
lower
end
went
down
and
dragged
the
rod
out
of
its
even
poise
it
slipped
and
then
it
fell
it
fell
down
upon
the
very
middle
of
the
cellar
and
lay
there
marking
that
spot
which
to
the
minds
of
the
boys
seemed
now
beyond
the
possibility
of
a
doubt
to
be
the
place
where
lay
the
pot
of
gold
thar
said
captain
corbet
now
breaking
the
silence
thar
you
see
with
your
own
eyes
how
it
pints
that
thar
is
the
actool
indyvidool
place
an
this
here
s
the
dozenth
time
it
s
done
it
with
me
o
it
s
thar
i
knowed
as
the
rod
fell
a
thrill
of
tremendous
excitement
had
passed
through
the
hearts
of
the
boys
and
their
belief
in
its
mystic
properties
was
so
strong
that
it
did
not
need
any
assurances
from
captain
corbet
to
confirm
it
yes
beyond
a
doubt
there
it
was
just
beneath
a
short
distance
down
the
wonderful
the
mysterious
the
alluring
pot
of
gold
at
last
the
silence
was
broken
by
tom
well
boys
said
he
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
it
the
question
is
said
phil
shall
we
dig
it
or
not
i
move
that
we
dig
of
course
said
bruce
we
ll
dig
it
there
s
only
one
answer
to
that
question
but
when
the
fellows
are
around
here
all
the
we
ll
have
to
do
it
after
dark
said
arthur
early
in
the
morning
would
be
the
best
time
i
think
said
bruce
a
little
anxiously
no
said
bart
there
s
only
one
time
and
one
hour
to
dig
money
and
that
time
is
midnight
and
the
hour
twelve
sharp
if
we
re
going
to
dig
for
a
pot
of
money
we
ll
have
to
do
it
up
in
proper
nonsense
said
bruce
who
still
spoke
in
a
rather
anxious
tone
what
are
you
talking
about
early
morning
is
the
early
morning
said
bart
why
man
alive
we
ll
want
several
hours
and
it
ll
be
early
morning
before
we
re
done
if
we
begin
at
early
morning
we
can
t
do
anything
some
of
the
fellows
are
always
up
here
before
breakfast
no
from
midnight
to
that
s
the
orthodox
time
besides
added
bart
mysteriously
there
are
certain
ceremonies
we
ll
have
to
perform
that
can
only
take
place
at
nonsense
said
bruce
let
s
tell
the
other
fellows
and
we
ll
all
dig
together
in
broad
tell
the
other
fellows
what
in
the
world
do
you
mean
cried
bart
bruce
rawdon
are
you
crazy
no
bruce
rawdon
was
not
crazy
he
was
only
a
little
superstitious
and
had
a
weakness
with
regard
to
ghosts
he
had
as
brave
and
stout
a
heart
as
ever
beat
with
which
to
confront
visible
dangers
and
mortal
enemies
but
his
stout
heart
quailed
at
the
fanciful
terrors
of
the
invisible
yet
he
saw
that
there
was
no
help
for
it
and
that
he
would
have
to
choose
the
midnight
hour
so
he
very
boldly
made
up
his
mind
to
face
whatever
terrors
the
enterprise
might
have
in
store
the
fact
is
said
bart
we
ourselves
we
the
b
must
do
it
it
would
be
dishonor
to
invite
the
other
boys
this
belongs
to
us
we
re
a
secret
and
mystic
order
we
ve
never
yet
had
anything
in
particular
to
do
now
s
our
time
and
here
s
our
chance
we
re
bound
to
get
at
that
pot
of
gold
the
captain
of
course
must
be
with
us
and
one
other
only
that
is
old
solomon
as
grand
panjandrum
he
must
be
here
and
share
our
we
ll
have
to
get
spades
said
arthur
i
suppose
solomon
can
manage
spades
said
bart
i
should
think
so
and
fifty
other
things
we
must
have
lights
we
ll
have
to
make
a
row
of
them
around
the
edge
of
the
a
row
of
them
said
phil
nonsense
two
will
no
said
bart
you
must
always
have
a
row
of
burning
lamps
around
whenever
you
dig
for
money
they
must
be
kept
burning
too
one
of
us
must
watch
the
lamps
woe
to
us
if
any
one
of
them
should
go
out
you
see
it
isn
t
an
ordinary
work
it
s
magic
digging
up
a
pot
of
gold
must
be
done
carefully
every
buried
pot
of
gold
can
only
be
got
up
according
to
a
regular
fashion
i
ve
got
a
book
that
tells
all
about
it
how
many
lights
how
many
spades
the
proper
time
and
all
that
above
all
we
ll
have
to
remember
to
keep
as
silent
as
death
when
we
re
working
and
never
speak
one
word
why
i
ve
heard
of
cases
where
they
touched
the
pot
of
gold
and
just
because
they
made
a
sort
of
cry
of
surprise
the
pot
at
once
sunk
down
ever
so
much
farther
and
so
they
had
to
do
it
all
over
did
bart
believe
all
this
nonsense
that
he
was
talking
it
is
very
difficult
to
say
he
was
not
at
all
superstitious
that
is
to
say
his
fancies
never
affected
his
actual
life
he
would
walk
through
a
graveyard
at
midnight
as
readily
as
he
would
go
along
a
road
at
the
same
time
his
brain
contained
such
an
odd
jumble
of
wild
fancies
and
his
imagination
was
so
vivid
that
his
ordinary
common
sense
was
lost
sight
of
he
could
follow
the
leadings
of
a
very
vivid
imagination
to
the
most
absurd
extent
if
he
had
been
really
in
his
heart
superstitious
he
would
have
shrunk
from
the
terrors
of
this
enterprise
but
his
real
faith
was
not
concerned
at
all
he
was
playing
very
earnestly
indeed
and
with
immense
excitement
yet
still
he
was
only
playing
at
digging
for
money
just
as
he
had
been
playing
at
being
a
bandit
or
a
pirate
he
was
quite
ready
therefore
to
comply
with
any
amount
of
superstitious
forms
the
rest
also
were
very
much
the
same
way
except
bruce
he
alone
looked
upon
the
matter
with
anxiety
but
he
fought
down
his
fear
by
an
effort
of
pure
courage
it
was
only
imagination
then
but
still
so
strong
was
their
imagination
that
it
made
the
whole
plan
one
of
sober
reality
and
they
discussed
it
as
though
it
were
so
you
see
said
bart
as
he
threw
himself
headlong
into
the
excitement
of
the
occasion
you
see
we
ve
got
to
be
careful
the
pot
of
gold
has
been
revealed
by
the
mineral
rod
if
we
had
dug
it
up
by
accident
of
course
we
could
have
got
it
without
any
trouble
but
it
has
been
revealed
by
magic
and
must
be
gained
by
the
laws
of
magic
i
ve
got
that
book
of
magic
you
know
and
it
tells
all
about
it
lights
around
in
number
any
multiple
of
three
or
seven
those
are
magic
numbers
our
number
inside
the
magic
circle
will
be
seven
that
s
one
reason
why
i
want
old
solomon
we
ll
have
to
keep
silent
and
not
say
a
word
we
must
not
begin
till
midnight
and
we
can
not
go
on
after
o
we
ll
manage
it
hurrah
for
the
b
c
and
so
after
some
further
discussion
they
decided
to
make
the
attempt
that
night
it
was
to
be
the
last
night
of
the
holidays
and
was
more
convenient
than
any
other
captain
corbet
was
to
meet
them
with
his
rod
and
a
spade
they
were
to
come
up
with
old
solomon
and
all
the
other
requisites
with
these
arrangements
they
parted
solemnly
from
captain
corbet
and
went
back
to
the
academy
bowed
down
by
the
burden
of
a
most
tremendous
secret
iii
deed
of
the
the
dim
forest
and
the
midnight
incantation
assisted
by
caesar
the
latin
grammar
and
sudden
startling
and
terrific
flight
of
the
b
they
rally
midnight
came
before
that
time
the
b
had
prepared
themselves
for
the
task
before
them
they
were
arrayed
in
the
and
rather
muddy
clothes
in
which
they
had
made
their
memorable
expedition
solomon
was
with
them
dressed
in
his
robes
of
office
the
venerable
grand
panjandrum
had
gathered
all
the
lanterns
that
he
could
collect
but
as
these
were
only
five
in
number
and
as
they
wanted
there
had
been
some
difficulty
this
had
at
length
been
remedied
by
means
of
baskets
pails
and
tin
kettles
for
it
was
thought
that
by
putting
a
candle
in
a
pail
or
something
of
that
sort
it
would
be
protected
from
the
wind
solomon
also
was
provided
with
matches
so
as
to
kindle
the
light
at
once
if
it
should
be
blown
out
and
bart
tried
in
the
most
solemn
manner
to
impress
upon
him
the
necessity
of
watchfulness
it
was
solomon
s
duty
to
watch
the
lights
and
nothing
else
the
others
were
to
dig
besides
the
pails
pots
lanterns
candlesticks
and
tin
kettles
they
carried
a
pickaxe
four
spades
and
the
bust
which
last
was
taken
in
order
to
add
still
more
to
the
solemnity
of
the
occasion
and
after
distributing
this
miscellaneous
load
as
equally
as
possible
among
the
multitude
they
at
length
set
out
the
academy
was
all
silent
and
all
were
hushed
in
the
depths
of
slumber
so
they
were
able
to
steal
forth
unobserved
and
make
their
way
to
the
old
french
the
night
was
quite
dark
and
as
they
walked
up
the
hill
the
scene
was
one
of
deep
impressiveness
overhead
the
sky
was
overcast
and
a
fresh
breeze
which
was
blowing
carried
the
thick
clouds
onward
fast
through
the
sky
the
moon
was
shining
but
the
dense
clouds
as
they
drove
past
obscured
it
at
times
and
the
darkness
that
arose
from
this
obscurity
was
succeeded
by
a
brighter
light
as
the
moon
now
and
then
shone
forth
before
them
rose
the
solemn
outline
of
the
dark
forest
gloomy
and
silent
and
the
stillness
that
reigned
there
was
not
broken
by
a
single
sound
after
walking
some
distance
they
stopped
partly
to
rest
and
partly
to
see
if
they
were
followed
as
they
turned
they
beheld
beneath
them
a
scene
equally
solemn
and
far
grander
immediately
below
lay
the
dark
outline
of
the
academy
and
beyond
this
the
scenery
of
grand
pré
on
the
right
extended
the
wide
plains
now
almost
lost
to
view
in
the
gloom
of
night
on
the
left
the
cornwallis
river
went
winding
afar
its
bed
full
its
waters
smooth
and
gleaming
white
amid
the
blackness
that
bordered
it
on
either
side
overhead
the
sky
arose
covered
over
with
its
clouds
between
which
the
moon
seemed
struggling
to
shine
forth
beneath
lay
the
dark
face
of
the
basin
of
minas
which
faded
away
into
the
dimness
of
the
opposite
shore
while
immediately
in
front
now
as
always
the
centre
of
the
scene
rose
blomidon
black
frowning
sombre
as
though
this
were
the
very
centre
from
which
emanated
all
the
shadows
of
the
night
at
the
top
of
the
hill
they
met
captain
corbet
who
had
a
spade
on
his
shoulder
it
s
rayther
dark
said
he
in
a
pensive
tone
ef
i
d
aknowed
it
was
to
be
so
dark
i
d
postponed
dark
said
bart
cheerily
not
a
bit
of
it
it
s
just
right
we
want
it
just
this
way
it
s
the
proper
thing
you
see
if
it
were
moonlight
we
d
be
discovered
but
this
darkness
hides
us
the
moon
peeps
out
now
and
then
just
enough
to
make
the
darkness
agreeable
this
is
just
the
way
it
ought
to
they
moved
on
in
silence
towards
the
spot
here
on
three
sides
the
forest
encircled
them
below
them
was
the
deep
dark
gully
and
the
shadows
of
the
forest
were
so
heavy
that
nothing
could
be
distinguished
at
a
distance
captain
corbet
usually
talkative
was
now
silent
and
pensive
and
uttered
an
occasional
sigh
as
for
solomon
he
did
not
say
one
word
the
whole
party
stood
for
a
moment
in
silence
looking
into
the
cellar
come
boys
said
bart
at
length
hurry
up
the
first
thing
we
ve
got
to
do
is
to
make
the
arrangements
we
must
arrange
the
saying
this
they
all
proceeded
to
put
down
their
lanterns
pots
kettles
pails
and
baskets
around
the
cellar
so
as
to
encircle
it
inside
each
of
the
pots
kettles
pails
and
baskets
a
candle
was
put
while
the
bust
was
placed
at
the
end
of
the
cellar
nearest
the
wood
now
said
bart
let
s
all
go
into
the
cellar
and
solomon
will
light
the
they
went
into
the
cellar
but
solomon
showed
so
much
clumsiness
in
lighting
them
that
bart
had
to
do
it
this
was
soon
accomplished
the
surrounding
forest
sheltered
them
from
the
wind
and
the
lights
did
not
flicker
very
much
except
at
times
when
an
occasional
puff
stronger
than
usual
would
be
felt
once
a
light
was
blown
out
but
bart
lighted
it
again
and
then
they
all
burned
very
well
so
there
they
stood
in
the
cellar
with
the
circle
of
lights
around
them
under
a
dark
sky
at
the
midnight
hour
i
feel
solemn

long
sigh

uncomfortable

and
he
pressed
his
hand
against
his
manly
bosom
never

said
bart
come
try
the
mineral
captain
corbet
took
the
rod
and
tried
to
balance
it
on
his
finger
but
his
hand
trembled
so
that
it
at
once
fell
to
the
ground
the
boys
gave
a
cry
of
delight
he
had
been
standing
as
before
in
the
middle
of
the
cellar
and
the
rod
fell
in
the
former
place
not
a
bit
of
doubt
about
it
cried
phil
there
it
goes
again
come
let
s
go
to
work
but
we
must
have
some
ceremonies
said
bart
it
would
never
do
to
begin
to
dig
without
so
i
say
remarked
captain
corbet
feebly
meanwhile
solomon
had
been
standing
in
his
robes
a
little
apart
looking
nervously
around
hallo
solomon
cried
bart
solomon
gave
a
start
ya

yas

ya
that

yasr
said
solomon
whose
teeth
seemed
to
be
chattering
and
who
seemed
quite
out
of
his
senses
bart
walked
up
to
him
and
saw
at
a
glance
how
it
was
why
old
solomon
said
he
gently

re
not
frightened

s
only

nonsense
come
grand

added
dropping
his
voice
between
you
and
me
we
none
of
us
take
it
in
earnest
come
you
keep
the
lamps
burning
and
be
the
grand
at
this
a
little
of
solomon
s
confidence
was
restored
he
ventured
to
the
edge
of
the
cellar
and
lifted
up
the
basket
in
time
to
save
it
from
burning
up
but
scarce
had
he
done
this
than
he
retreated
the
gloom
the
darkness
the
magic
ceremonies
were
too
awful
come
said
tom
let
s
begin
the
captain
corbet
gave
another
sigh
i
feel
dreadful
anxious
said
he
about
the
infant

m
afeard

feel
as
if

said
bart

and
with
the
of
you

the
ceremonies

solemn
occasion

awful
dark
we

so
let

don
t
have
any
heathen
o
the
ceremonies
are
not
heathen
said
bart
each
of
us
is
going
to
make
an
incantation
in
the
most
solemn
language
that
we
can
think
of
so
boys
the
most
solemn
thing
that
i
can
think
of
said
phil
is
english
history
so
here
and
stretching
forth
his
hand
solemnly
he
said
in
a
whining
voice
like
a
boy
reciting
a
lesson
was
very
little
known
to
the
rest
of
the
world
before
the
time
of
the
romans
the
coasts
opposite
gaul
were
frequented
by
merchants
who
traded
thither
for
such
commodities
as
the
natives
were
able
to
the
most
solemn
thing
to
me
said
tom
is
and
then
he
added
in
the
same
tone
square
described
on
the
hypothenuse
of
a
triangle
is
equal
to
the
sum
of
the
squares
described
on
the

sides
of

said
bruce
have
something
far
more
and
stretching
out
his
hand
he
said
in
a
loud
firm
voice
indignus

the
for
my
part
said
bart
the
most
solemn
thing
to
me
is
cæsar
the
way
they
teach
it
here
makes
it
a
concentration
of
all
the
worst
horrors
of
the
grammar
and
arnold
and
history
with
the
additional
horrors
of
an

said
bart
it

they
were
satisfied
with
good
honest
english
it
was
a
solemn
time
with
them
thar

for
them
so
on
this
solemn
occasion
let
us
talk
english
or
forever
after
hold
our
well
what
shall
we
do
asked
bart
do
said
captain
corbet
why
do
somethin
solemn
i
should
like
he
added
mildly
ef
you
could
it
would
be
kind
o
sewthin
ef
you
could
sing
a
a
hymn
said
bart
now
bart
had
a
quick
talent
for
making
up
jingling
rhymes
so
he
immediately
improvised
the
following
which
he
gave
out
two
lines
at
a
time
to
be
sung
by
the
b
it
was
sung
to
the
mournful
the
solemn
the
venerable
and
the
very
appropriate
tune
known
as
rousseau
s
why
did
we
deprive
the
frenchman
of
his
lands
against
his
will
take
possession
of
his
marshes
raise
a
on
the
hill
twas
a
foolish
by
such
tricks
to
hope
for
gain
all
that
ever
comes
by
thieving
turns
to
sorrow
care
and
pain
ours
is
now
the
retribution
see
the
fate
that
falls
on
us
awful
tasks
in
greek
and
latin
algebra
and
calculus
yet
for
all
the
tribulation
which
the
morrow
must
behold
we
may
find
alleviation
in
the
frenchman
s
of
gold
the
wailing
notes
of
the
tune
rose
up
into
the
dark
night
and
the
tones
as
they
were
dolefully
droned
out
by
the
b
died
away
in
the
dim
forest
around
captain
corbet
gave
a
long
sigh
as
they
ended
solemner
and
solemner
he
slowly
ejaculated
i
wish
the
biz
was
well
said
bart
the
way
to
have
it
over
is
to
begin
as
soon
as
possible
but
remember
this
all
of
you
after
the
first
stroke
of
spade
or
pickaxe
not
a
word
must
be
spoken
not
a
word
not
one
no
matter
what
may
happen
no
matter
how
surprised
astonished
terrified
horrified
mystified
or
scarified
we
may
be
mum
s
the
word
any
other
word
will
break
the
spell
and
then
where
are
we
and
you
solomon
mind
the
lights
don
t
you
dare
to
let
one
of
them
go
out
as
you
value
your
life
keep
them
going
above
all
mind
that
tin
kettle
in
the
corner
the
wick
is
bad
and
it
s
flaring
away
at
a
tremendous
rate
and
don
t
let
the
baskets
upset
have
you
got
your
matches
ya
yasr
said
solomon
whose
teeth
were
now
chattering
again
and
who
looked
with
utter
horror
at
the
row
of
lights
which
he
was
ordered
to
watch
will
you
take
the
pickaxe
captain
wal
said
captain
corbet
in
a
faint
voice
i
hardly
know
perhaps
you
d
better
dig
an
i
ll
go
over
to
the
fence
and
see
that
no
one
go
over
to
the
fence
cried
bart
what
go
out
through
that
row
of
lights
and
after
our
incantations
why
captain
corbet
don
t
you
think
of
anything
of
the
kind
we
are
seven
it
s
a
mystic
number
you
must
stay
with
captain
corbet
heaved
a
sigh
wal
said
he
i
ll
take
one
of
the
i
ll
take
the
pickaxe
said
bruce
very
well
said
bart
you
begin
stir
up
the
earth
and
we
ll
all
dig
but
after
the
first
stroke
remember
not
one
word
bruce
then
seized
the
pickaxe
with
nervous
energy
and
raising
it
he
hurled
it
into
the
ground
as
it
struck
solomon
shuddered
and
clasped
his
hands
captain
corbet
stepped
back
and
looked
wildly
around
again
and
again
bruce
wielded
the
pickaxe
dashing
it
into
the
earth
with
powerful
blows
and
then
wrenching
it
so
as
to
pry
up
the
sods
the
others
looked
on
in
silence
at
length
he
had
loosened
the
earth
all
about
and
to
a
considerable
depth
after
this
he
stood
back
and
the
other
boys
went
to
work
with
their
spades
bruce
waited
for
a
little
time
and
then
dropping
the
pickaxe
he
seized
a
spade
and
plunged
it
into
the
ground
and
rapidly
threw
up
the
soil
doing
as
much
work
as
any
two
of
the
others
for
some
time
they
worked
thus
the
silence
was
profound
being
only
broken
by
the
clash
of
the
spades
against
the
stones
and
the
hard
breathing
of
the
boys
at
last
they
hod
dug
up
all
the
earth
that
had
been
loosened
by
bruce
and
the
hard
soil
began
to
present
an
insuperable
barrier
to
the
progress
of
the
spades
seeing
this
bruce
seized
the
pickaxe
once
more
and
again
hurled
it
with
vigorous
blows
into
the
ground
loosening
the
earth
all
around
at
last
as
he
flung
it
down
with
all
his
force
it
struck
against
something
which
gave
so
peculiar
a
sound
that
the
boys
all
started
and
caught
one
another
s
arms
and
looked
at
one
another
in
the
dim
moonlight
each
trying
to
see
the
face
of
the
other
bruce
stopped
for
an
instant
and
then
swinging
the
pickaxe
again
over
his
head
he
dashed
it
down
with
all
his
force
again
it
struck
that
hard
substance
under
ground
and
again
there
was
that
peculiar
sound
it
was
a
sound
that
could
not
be
mistaken
it
was
not
such
a
sound
as
would
be
given
by
a
stone
or
by
a
stick
of
timber
it
was
something
very
different
it
was
hard
ringing
metallic
and
as
that
sound
struck
upon
the
ears
of
the
b
there
was
but
one
thought
a
thought
which
came
simultaneously
to
the
minds
of
all
the
thought
that
bruce
s
pickaxe
had
reached
the
buried
treasure
but
the
pot
of
gold
now
became
to
their
imaginations
an
iron
chest
filled
with
coin
and
it
was
against
this
iron
chest
that
the
pickaxe
had
struck
and
it
was
this
iron
chest
which
had
given
forth
the
sound
yet
so
schooled
were
they
so
determined
upon
success
that
even
the
immensity
of
such
a
sensation
could
not
make
them
forget
their
silence
not
one
word
was
spoken
they
felt
they
thought
but
they
did
not
speak
suddenly
bruce
flung
down
the
pickaxe
and
seized
his
spade
at
once
all
the
others
rushed
forward
to
join
in
the
task
bruce
was
first
his
spade
was
plunged
deep
into
the
loosened
earth
bight
and
left
it
was
flung
the
spades
of
the
others
were
plunged
in
also
all
of
them
were
digging
wildly
and
furiously
and
panting
heavily
with
their
exertion
and
their
excitement
each
one
had
felt
his
spade
strike
and
grate
against
that
hard
metallic
substance
which
the
pickaxe
had
struck
and
which
they
now
fully
believed
to
be
the
pot
of
gold
each
one
was
in
the
full
swing
of
eager
expectation
when
suddenly
there
came
an
awful
interruption
they
might
have
been
digging
five
minutes
or
an
hour
they
could
never
tell
exactly
afterwards
when
they
talked
it
over
and
compared
one
another
s
impressions
they
could
not
come
to
any
decision
for
all
idea
of
time
had
been
lost
engaged
in
their
work
they
took
no
note
of
minutes
or
hours
but
while
they
were
working
captain
corbet
had
stood
aloof
he
held
a
spade
in
his
listless
hands
but
he
did
not
use
it
he
was
looking
on
nervously
and
with
a
pale
face
and
his
thoughts
were
such
as
can
not
be
described
solomon
also
stood
with
trembling
frame
and
chattering
teeth
a
prey
to
superstitious
terror
to
solomon
had
been
committed
the
care
of
the
lights
yet
he
did
not
dare
to
venture
near
them
for
that
matter
he
did
not
dare
even
look
at
them
his
gaze
was
fixed
on
the
boys
while
at
times
his
eyes
would
roll
fearfully
over
the
dark
outline
of
those
dim
and
sombre
woods
whose
shadows
lowered
gloomily
before
him
such
then
was
the
situation
the
boys
busy
and
excited
captain
corbet
nervous
and
idle
and
fearful
solomon
trembling
from
head
to
foot
and
overcome
with
a
thousand
wild
and
superstitious
fancies
when
suddenly
close
beside
them
outside
of
the
row
of
lights
just
as
their
spades
struck
the
metallic
substance
before
mentioned
suddenly
instantaneously
and
without
the
slightest
warning
there
arose
a
sharp
a
fearful
a
terrible
uproar
something
midway
between
a
shriek
and
a
peal
of
thunder
a
roar
in
fact
so
hideous
so
wild
so
unparalleled
in
its
horrid
accompaniments
that
it
shook
the
boldest
heart
in
that
small
but
bold
company
it
rose
on
high
it
seemed
to
fill
all
the
air
and
its
awful
echoes
prolonged
themselves
afar
through
the
darkness
of
the
midnight
scene
the
boys
started
back
from
the
hole
their
spades
dropped
from
their
hands
they
saw
about
half
of
the
lights
extinguished
and
amid
the
gloom
they
could
perceive
two
figures
rushing
in
mad
haste
away
from
the
spot
a
panic
seized
upon
them
before
a
panic
the
stoutest
heart
is
as
weak
as
water
even
the
b
yielded
to
its
influence
they
shrank
back
they
retreated
they
passed
the
line
of
flickering
lights
they
fled
away
away
back
from
this
terrible
place
back
towards
the
academy
so
fled
the
b
first
of
all
the
fugitives
was
solomon
he
had
been
nearly
frightened
out
of
his
wits
long
before
these
proceedings
half
in
joke
had
been
no
joke
to
him
in
spite
of
bart
s
assurances
he
had
stood
a
trembling
spectator
neglectful
of
his
duty
the
wind
had
blown
out
the
lights
one
by
one
far
from
lighting
them
again
he
had
not
even
watched
them
every
moment
his
fear
had
increased
until
at
last
his
limbs
were
almost
paralyzed
with
terror
but
at
length
when
that
awful
roar
had
arisen
his
stupor
was
dispelled
an
overmastering
horror
had
seized
him
he
burst
through
the
line
of
lights
he
fled
across
the
field
he
ran
with
his
official
robes
streaming
behind
him
towards
the
academy
off
went
his
hat
he
heeded
it
not
he
kept
on
his
way
he
reached
the
door
of
the
house
he
burst
in
up
the
stairs
and
up
another
flight
and
up
another
flight
and
yet
another
so
he
ran
until
at
last
he
reached
his
room
arriving
here
he
banged
to
the
door
and
moved
his
bedstead
against
it
and
heaped
upon
the
bedstead
his
trunk
his
chairs
his
table
his
his
boots
his
washstand
and
every
movable
in
the
room
then
tearing
off
the
bedclothes
he
rolled
himself
up
in
them
and
crouching
down
in
a
corner
of
the
room
he
lay
there
sleepless
and
trembling
till
daybreak
nor
was
solomon
the
only
fugitive
scarcely
had
he
bounded
away
in
his
headlong
flight
before
captain
corbet
with
a
cry
of
o
my
babby
plunged
after
him
through
the
line
of
lights
into
the
gloom
that
surrounded
the
spot
and
there
over
that
track
which
saw
the
college
gown
of
solomon
and
the
coat
tails
of
captain
corbet
streaming
in
the
wind
there
fast
and
far
in
wild
confusion
in
headlong
panic
fled
the
b
who
ran
first
and
who
came
last
matters
not
i
certainly
will
never
tell
enough
is
it
for
me
to
say
that
they
ran
such
is
the
power
of
panic
great
however
as
was
that
panic
it
did
not
last
long
and
by
the
time
they
reached
the
edge
of
the
playground
on
the
crest
of
the
hill
they
all
slackened
their
pace
and
stopped
by
mutual
consent
there
they
stood
in
silence
for
some
time
looking
back
at
the
place
from
which
they
had
fled
and
where
now
a
few
lights
were
still
flickering
and
there
was
one
great
question
in
all
their
minds
what
was
it
but
this
none
of
them
could
tell
and
so
they
all
kept
silent
that
silence
was
at
last
broken
by
bart
well
boys
said
he
what
are
we
going
to
do
now
our
shovels
and
lights
are
there
and
worst
of
all
our
palladium
bust
solomon
has
gone
and
captain
corbet
but
we
still
remain
we
ve
rallied
and
now
what
shall
we
do
shall
we
retreat
or
go
back
again
to
the
hole
bart
spoke
and
silence
followed
overhead
the
clouds
swept
wrathfully
before
the
face
of
the
moon
and
all
around
rose
the
dim
forest
shades
in
front
flickered
and
twinkled
the
feeble
fitful
lights
and
there
by
those
lights
was
that
whatever
it
was
from
which
they
had
fled
i
ll
tell
you
what
i
ll
do
at
any
rate
said
bruce
in
a
harsh
constrained
voice
ll
go
back
to
that
hole
if
i
die
for
you
cried
bart
yes
said
bruce
standing
with
his
fists
close
clinched
and
his
brow
darkly
frowning
yes
i
you
fellows
may
come
or
stay
just
as
you
a
man
s
courage
must
be
measured
from
his
own
idea
of
danger
a
couple
of
hundred
years
ago
many
acts
were
brave
which
are
commonplace
to
defy
the
superstitions
of
the
age
may
be
a
sign
of
transcendent
courage
now
of
all
these
boys
bruce
was
by
far
the
most
superstitious
yet
he
was
the
first
who
offered
to
go
back
to
face
from
which
they
had
all
fled
it
was
an
effort
of
pure
pluck
it
was
a
grand
recoil
from
the
superstitious
timidity
of
his
weaker
self
buoyed
up
by
his
lofty
pride
and
sense
of
shame
he
crushed
down
the
fear
that
rose
within
him
and
his
very
superstition
made
his
act
all
the
more
courageous
and
as
he
spoke
those
last
words
before
the
others
had
time
to
say
anything
in
reply
he
turned
abruptly
and
strode
back
with
firm
steps
towards
the
cellar
so
he
stalked
off
steeling
his
shaking
nerves
and
rousing
up
the
resources
of
his
lofty
nature
by
that
victory
over
the
flesh
he
grew
calm
and
walked
steadily
back
into
the
dark
ready
to
encounter
any
danger
that
might
be
lingering
there
an
example
of
splendid
courage
and
conquest
over
fear
but
he
did
not
long
walk
alone
before
he
had
taken
a
dozen
steps
the
others
were
with
him
and
in
a
short
time
they
were
all
in
the
hole
again
bart
proceeded
to
light
the
extinguished
candles
while
bruce
quietly
picked
up
the
spades
assisted
by
the
other
boys
soon
all
the
lights
were
burning
and
bart
joined
the
little
knot
of
boys
who
were
standing
in
the
centre
of
the
cellar
well
said
he
coolly
the
old
question
is
before
us
what
are
we
to
do
now
shall
we
stay
here
and
dig
or
shall
we
go
home
and
go
to
bed
for
my
part
if
you
wish
to
dig
i
ll
dig
but
at
the
same
time
i
think
we
d
better
retire
taking
our
things
with
us
and
postpone
our
digging
till
another
i
won
t
say
anything
about
it
said
bruce
i
ll
do
either
one
thing
however
i
promise
not
to
do
whatever
happens
i
won
t
run
the
fact
is
said
arthur
there
s
no
use
talking
about
digging
any
more
it
was
all
very
well
while
we
were
in
the
humor
it
was
all
fun
but
the
fun
has
gone
we
ve
disgraced
ourselves
what
was
i
don
t
pretend
to
know
but
it
may
have
been
a
trick
if
so
we
re
watched
and
i
don
t
think
any
of
us
feel
inclined
to
dig
here
with
some
of
the
other
fellows
giggling
at
us
from
among
the
it
may
have
been
the
gaspereaugians
said
phil
suddenly
a
heavy
sigh
was
heard
not
far
away
said
bart
what
s
that
that
one
of
the
cows
said
tom
i
tell
you
what
it
is
boys
said
phil
some
of
the
fellows
have
got
wind
of
our
plan
and
have
been
playing
this
trick
on
us
if
so
we
ll
never
hear
the
end
of
i
d
rather
have
our
fellows
do
it
than
the
said
bart
solemnly
what
a
pity
we
didn
t
think
of
this
before
we
began
we
d
not
have
been
taken
so
by
well
said
phil
i
believe
it
was
some
trick
but
how
any
human
beings
could
contrive
to
make
such
an
unearthly
noise
such
a
mixture
of
thunder
and
howling
and
screeching
i
can
not
for
the
life
of
me
still
said
bruce
it
may
have
been
a
trick
it
may
have
been
something
which
ought
to
make
us
i
believe
said
tom
that
we
ll
find
out
all
about
it
yet
let
us
only
keep
dark
say
nothing
and
keep
our
eyes
and
ears
open
we
ll
find
it
out
some
well
said
arthur
i
suppose
we
re
all
out
of
the
humor
for
digging
if
so
suppose
we
smooth
over
this
hole
and
then
we
can
take
away
our
lights
and
spades
my
only
idea
in
coming
back
was
to
get
the
things
and
destroy
all
traces
of
our
all
right
said
bruce
seizing
a
spade
the
other
boys
did
the
same
and
soon
the
hole
was
filled
up
they
placed
the
sods
over
it
as
neatly
as
they
could
and
though
the
soil
bore
marks
of
disturbance
yet
they
were
not
conspicuous
enough
to
excite
particular
attention
then
they
proceeded
to
gather
up
the
things
so
as
to
carry
them
away
in
the
midst
of
this
there
came
a
voice
out
of
the
darkness
a
long
loud
shrill
voice
a
voice
of
painful
eager
anxious
inquiry
o
it
s
captain
corbet
cried
bart
he
shouted
all
re
all
come
he
stopped
shouting
then
and
they
all
listened
attentively
soon
they
heard
footsteps
approaching
and
before
long
they
saw
emerging
from
the
gloom
the
familiar
form
and
the
reverend
features
of
captain
corbet
he
came
down
into
the
hole
and
after
giving
a
furtive
look
all
around
he
said
so

ben
a
toughin
of
it

said
bart
we

captain
corbet
while
a
gleam
of
joy
illuminated
his
venerable
face
you
ran
what
actilly
not
railly
yes
we
all
ran
and
stopped
at
the
edge
of
the
hill
and
then
seeing
nothing
we
came
back
to
get
the
wal
said
captain
corbet
that

now
sence

of
awe

took

mineral
rod

and
pickaxes
and
shovels
and
hoes
and
candles
and
lanterns
and
finally
the
bust
these
they
bore
away
and
bidding
an
affectionate
adieu
to
captain
corbet
they
went
to
the
academy
and
succeeded
in
reaching
their
rooms
unobserved
and
during
all
the
time
that
they
lingered
in
the
cellar
there
was
no
repetition
of
that
sound
nor
was
there
any
interruption
whatever

captain
corbet
in
the
grasp
of
the
law
long
to
the
rescue
the
next
morning
came
it
was
a
glorious
sunrise
nowhere
out
of
italy
i
think
can
be
seen
such
sunrises
and
sunsets
as
those
of
grand
pré
and
you
may
see
all
that
can
be
presented
by
even
italy
in
every
part
of
its
varied
outline
on
the
plain
on
the
or
by
the
you
may
traverse
the
apennines
or
wander
by
the
mediterranean
shore
or
look
over
the
waste
campagna
and
yet
never
find
anything
that
can
surpass
those
atmospheric
effects
which
may
be
witnessed
along
the
shores
that
surround
the
basin
of
minas
here
may
be
found
that
which
would
fill
the
soul
of
the
poet
or
artist
the
dreamy
haze
the
soft
and
voluptuous
calm
the
glory
of
the
sunlit
sky
the
terror
of
the
storm
the
majesty
of
giant
cloud
masses
piled
up
confusedly
the
rainbow
tints
cast
by
the
rising
or
setting
sun
over
innumerable
clouds
the
sun
now
arose
from
out
a
congregated
mass
of
clouds
and
threw
a
dull
red
glow
over
all
the
east
above
the
wide
plains
of
grand
pré
there
hung
dense
exhalations
which
had
risen
through
the
night
from
the
dike
lands
and
were
now
waiting
to
be
dissipated
the
valley
of
cornwallis
lay
slumbrous
and
dreamy
in
a
thin
haze
which
rose
above
it
and
in
the
distance
the
black
outline
of
the
north
mountain
peered
obscurely
the
broad
bosom
of
the
basin
of
minas
had
a
peculiar
tinge
for
seen
through
the
land
mist
and
the
distant
haze
it
was
perfectly
calm
and
unruffled
and
the
hue
of
its
surface
seemed
and
this
flood
lay
embosomed
amid
shores
of
gray
which
deepened
as
they
came
nearer
into
black
and
here
at
this
time
as
always
the
centre
of
the
scene
as
much
the
controller
of
the
basin
of
minas
as
vesuvius
is
the
monarch
of
the
bay
of
naples
black
frowning
indistinct
blomidon
rose
and
seemed
to
gather
to
himself
the
intensest
shades
of
darkness
the
fog
from
the
bay
of
fundy
projected
itself
through
the
strait
of
minas
far
into
the
basin
while
over
the
crest
of
the
giant
cliff
piled
up
in
yast
confused
masses
heap
over
heap
like
the
mountains
reared
by
the
fabled
titans
there
arose
a
tremendous
accumulation
of
clouds
at
first
all
the
east
was
red
and
over
the
land
mist
and
over
the
hazy
valley
and
over
the
sea
there
came
a
dull
glow
which
made
the
scene
resemble
some
place
that
is
illumined
by
the
glare
of
some
vast
conflagration
but
the
moments
passed
and
the
sun
climbed
higher
and
the
dull
glow
of
the
red
changed
to
a
more
vivid
hue
the
glare
of
that
rising
sun
still
red
yet
vivid
and
penetrating
and
more
and
more
luminous
as
it
rose
above
the
clouds
flung
itself
over
all
the
scene
the
long
clouds
that
stretched
over
the
east
spread
across
the
sky
like
bars
of
ruddy
gold
a
flame
seemed
to
light
up
all
the
land
mists
that
rolled
over
the
dikes
of
grand
pré
a
luminous
haze
hung
like
a
mantle
of
glory
over
cornwallis
the
sea
grew
all
tinged
with
a
brilliant
pink
and
the
distant
shores
once
dark
gray
deepening
into
black
now
became
purple
the
form
of
blomidon
changed
from
its
ebon
hue
to
a
deep
indigo
while
the
haze
over
its
crest
had
the
tinge
of
flame
far
overhead
as
they
rose
piled
up
into
the
sky
the
clouds
caught
the
lustre
of
that
sunrise
they
shimmered
and
quivered
as
blown
by
the
wind
they
rolled
along
receiving
every
moment
in
a
new
direction
the
rays
of
the
sun
they
grew
from
pale
pink
to
ruddiness
and
from
ruddiness
to
vermilion
and
from
vermilion
to
the
dazzle
of
a
golden
lustre
till
there
arose
before
the
view
a
mass
presenting
the
reality
of
all
that
has
ever
been
imagined
of
the
splendors
of
an
aerial
scene
where
deep
down
there
lay
a
dull
red
foundation
on
which
arose
a
pyramid
of
pink
of
vermilion
and
of
gold
but
all
these
passed
these
effects
were
only
momentary
in
an
instant
each
shifting
scene
had
vanished
leaving
only
the
remembrance
of
its
glory
the
sun
climbed
higher
the
land
mists
grew
gray
the
haze
faded
out
the
sea
surface
became
blue
blomidon
changed
to
dark
olive
the
clouds
above
lost
all
their
splendor
in
a
leaden
color
and
at
last
as
the
sun
attained
a
greater
height
it
shone
from
a
blue
sky
upon
a
blue
sea
with
its
circle
of
green
shores
from
which
fog
and
mist
and
cloud
were
all
rapidly
hurrying
away

table
that
morning
with
visible
signs
of
weariness
and
exhaustion
they
had
been
up
too
late
they
had
worked
too
hard
at
an
unaccustomed
labor
and
they
had
been
subject
to
a
very
strong
excitement
they
said
nothing
however
and
none
of
their
schoolmates
noticed
anything
peculiar
about
them
they
were
very
anxious
to
learn
whether
any
of
the
boys
had
been
concerned
in
the
trick
which
they
believed
had
been
played
upon
them
but
the
perfect
unconsciousness
as
to
the
events
of
the
past
night
which
was
evinced
by
all
their
companions
showed
most
plainly
that
they
at
least
could
have
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
it
in
order
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure
they
talked
separately
and
individually
with
each
of
them
so
as
to
see
if
there
were
any
lurking
signs
of
an
acquaintance
with
their
midnight
adventure
but
the
result
of
this
examination
confirmed
the
opinion
which
they
had
formed
before
and
they
all
concluded
that
if
there
had
been
a
trick
none
of
the
boys
of
the
school
had
anything
to
do
with
it
one
conclusion
only
remained
it
must
be
the
gaspereaugians
nine
o
clock
was
the
hour
for
assembling
in
the
but
before
that
hour
long
appeared
in
the
yard
of
the
academy
where
most
of
the
boys
were
gathered
and
collected
together
all
those
who
had
gone
with
him
on
the
late
expedition
there
was
evidently
something
on
his
mind
the
small
boys
could
see
this
and
they
all
joined
the
throng
till
at
length
every
boy
in
the
place
had
assembled
there
long
s
business
was
soon
explained
it
was
about
that
stone
wall
which
he
had
caused
to
be
appropriated
to
furnish
ballast
for
the
antelope
he
had
heard
that
the
owner
of
the
wall
had
been
vowing
vengeance
during
their
absence
and
was
extremely
anxious
to
have
it
all
replaced
but
the
trouble
was
he
could
not
get
any
laborers
all
the
farmers
about
were
hard
at
work
in
their
fields
and
all
the
seafaring
men
had
gone
to
boston
with
potatoes
he
was
therefore
in
a
very
awkward
position
so
he
had
taken
counsel
with
porter
and
with
his
consent
determined
to
get
the
assistance
of
the
boys
they
had
put
the
stones
in
very
easily
and
it
seemed
equally
easy
for
them
to
take
them
all
out
again
and
replace
them
of
course
some
reward
would
be
needed
as
a
stimulus
in
putting
them
in
they
had
been
stimulated
by
the
hope
of
going
on
the
expedition
something
equally
attractive
would
be
needed
as
an
inducement
for
them
to
take
them
out
so
long
and
porter
had
thought
of
something
which
would
supply
this
required
inducement
and
the
former
now
appeared
to
make
known
the
result
to
the
boys
it
was
this
he
invited
all
the
boys
to
come
and
help
him
in
this
work
of
unloading
the
ballast
and
replacing
the
stone
wall
and
promised
them
as
a
reward
the
continuation
of
their
holidays
for
the
remainder
of
the
week
at
this
there
was
but
one
response
it
came
in
the
shape
of
a
wild
hurrah
unload
the
vessel
yes
and
a
dozen
vessels
holidays
more
hoik
days
what
wouldn
t
they
do
to
get
them
how
lucky
it
was
that
all
the
farm
laborers
were
hard
at
work
and
all
the
sailors
were
off
to
boston
what
a
valuable
and
interesting
plant
was
the
potato
which
had
thus
thrown
in
their
way
the
chance
to
earn
holidays
for
themselves
so
hurrah
boys
and
hurrah
again
stone
walls
build
them
why
we
ll
build
a
dozen
to
get
more
holidays
so
they
thought
and
so
they
talked
and
so
they
shouted
and
thus
convinced
long
of
the
success
of
his
experiment
not
only
all
of
the
late
voyageurs
accompanied
him
to
the
antelope
but
all
the
small
boys
also
every
one
of
them
in
fact
the
whole
school
went
down
every
one
eager
to
do
something
so
as
to
earn
his
holiday
it
was
not
labor
it
was
a
frolic
it
was
fun
for
them
and
it
was
singular
to
see
the
effect
which
this
proposal
produced
upon
the
b
before
this
they
had
been
wearied
exhausted
fagged
out
in
fact
used
up
by
their
laborious
exertions
and
the
tremendous
excitement
of
the
past
night
together
with
the
loss
of
their
usual
sleep
but
now
at
the
prospect
of
more
holidays
they
roused
themselves
all
their
energies
were
at
once
excited
they
forgot
in
a
moment
all
their
past
exertions
with
the
sleeplessness
that
had
resulted
and
felt
as
much
vigor
as
though
they
had
slept
for
ten
hours
instead
of
five
down
they
all
went
therefore
to
where
the
antelope
lay
and
the
procession
although
not
quite
so
grotesque
as
on
a
former
occasion
was
still
sufficiently
striking
to
attract
considerable
attention
from
the
villagers
first
of
all
went
long
alone
for
simmops
did
not
feel
inclined
to
go
he
was
busy
preparing
his
lessons
for
the
boys
after
the
leader
followed
the
elder
boys
who
had
been
on
the
expedition
then
came
a
confused
crowd
of
small
boys
they
didn
t
walk
in
military
order
exactly
in
fact
they
had
no
order
at
all
and
if
it
must
be
confessed
they
were
somewhat
disorderly
at
any
rate
they
beguiled
that
inarch
by
playing
at
or
riding
on
one
another
s
backs
or
doing
something
else
equally
striking
to
the
village
mind
all
the
way
down
at
last
they
arrived
at
the
scene
of
action
long
put
bruce
and
jiggins
who
were
the
largest
boys
in
the
school
into
the
hold
of
the
schooner
to
lift
out
the
stones
and
then
ranged
a
double
line
of
boys
of
all
sizes
between
the
schooner
and
the
place
where
the
stone
wall
had
formerly
been
he
then
took
arthur
billymack
pat
and
bart
as
his
assistants
and
stood
by
the
wall
to
build
it
up
again
with
the
stones
from
the
antelope
he
himself
worked
with
his
own
hands
in
building
up
the
wall
and
directed
his
assistants
there
were
a
great
many
stones
but
then
there
were
a
great
many
hands
at
work
and
so
at
last
after
violent
labor
which
however
was
all
the
time
cheered
and
alleviated
by
the
prospect
of
additional
holidays
the
work
was
completed
once
more
the
stone
wall
arose
quite
as
good
as
it
had
been
before
and
in
fact
even
better
on
the
spot
whence
it
had
been
taken
and
so
vigorously
had
the
nimble
hands
worked
and
so
skilfully
had
long
and
his
assistants
piled
up
the
stones
that
they
were
able
to
go
back
to
the
hills
to
take
their
dinner
with
the
happy
consciousness
first
that
they
had
earned
holidays
for
the
remainder
of
the
week
and
secondly
that
the
stone
wall
was
a
far
better
one
as
they
had
built
it
than
it
had
been
when
it
was
taken
away
so
long
said
as
he
expressed
his
thanks
for
their
labors
and
his
deep
gratification
at
the
fair
result
and
so
they
all
felt
as
they
looked
at
that
wall
which
though
built
by
the
hands
of
amateurs
was
still
far
better
in
every
respect
than
the
older
portions
the
work
of
other
hands
that
stood
beside
it
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
the
boys
were
all
too
wearied
to
engage
in
any
play
the
b
in
particular
were
exhausted
from
their
double
toil
they
spent
the
afternoon
together
in
bart
s
room
talking
over
the
events
of
that
memorable
evening
when
they
had
dug
for
money
solomon
since
then
had
kept
out
of
sight
they
themselves
did
not
feel
at
all
inclined
to
reproach
him
their
thoughts
did
not
refer
at
all
to
him
nor
to
captain
corbet
but
rather
to
that
unearthly
noise
which
had
driven
them
to
a
disgraceful
flight
most
of
them
thought
that
it
was
a
trick
of
the
gaspereaugians
bruce
alone
rejected
this
theory
and
plainly
stated
his
belief
that
it
was
something
supernatural
if
it
had
been
the
gaspereaugians
he
argued
would
they
have
left
us
unmolested
after
we
went
back
no
it
was
because
we
did
not
dig
that
we
were
let
alone
if
we
had
begun
to
dig
again
and
if
we
had
struck
that
metallic
box
again
then
we
should
have
heard
that
roar
and
something
a
good
deal
worse
but
this
was
only
bruce
s
opinion
none
of
the
others
held
it
they
were
convinced
that
it
was
the
trick
of
the
gaspereaugians
and
were
eager
to
find
ont
some
way
of
retaliating
on
their
enemies
but
they
could
not
imagine
any
way
in
which
to
do
it
the
hours
of
the
day
passed
on
and
late
in
the
afternoon
they
went
out
for
a
walk
not
having
any
particular
route
in
view
they
strolled
down
through
the
village
and
very
naturally
directed
their
steps
towards
mud
creek
so
as
to
take
another
look
at
the
antelope
and
particularly
at
that
stone
fence
which
had
cost
them
so
much
labor
and
blistered
all
the
hands
in
the
school
on
reaching
the
spot
a
startling
sight
met
their
eyes
there
perched
upon
the
very
stone
wall
which
they
had
assisted
to
build
with
his
arms
folded
round
his
knees
and
his
chin
pressed
upon
the
same
with
his
whole
figure
drawn
up
into
the
smallest
compass
into
which
it
is
possible
for
the
human
frame
to
gather
itself
they
saw
a
familiar
shape
the
sight
of
which
as
they
saw
it
in
such
an
attitude
startled
them
extremely
it
was
no
other
than
captain
corbet
drawn
up
thus
folding
thus
his
knees
with
his
arms
leaning
thus
his
chin
upon
his
knees
he
came
before
their
startled
vision
but
he
himself
was
quite
unconscious
of
their
presence
his
face
was
turned
to
the
scene
which
presented
itself
before
him
and
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
that
scene
to
the
exclusion
of
all
other
things
and
they
as
they
came
up
behind
him
saw
gradually
what
that
scene
was
since
they
had
been
there
last
the
tide
had
reached
its
height
and
had
fallen
mud
creek
now
lay
before
them
perfectly
empty
of
water
and
presenting
to
their
view
an
expanse
of
nothing
else
except
soft
slimy
slippery
oleaginous
mud
which
now
spread
away
in
an
impassable
gulf
and
showed
the
justice
and
the
truth
of
that
uneuphonious
name
but
the
vast
abyss
of
soft
slimy
and
oleaginous
mud
and
the
wide
impassable
valley
composed
thereof
and
the
rise
and
the
fall
of
these
extraordinary
tides
were
not
the
attractions
which
riveted
the
gaze
of
captain
corbet
and
the
eyes
of
the
boys
of
the
b
as
they
drew
nearer
it
was
something
far
different
something
in
fact
which
touched
them
all
in
common
with
a
deep
feeling
of
sorrow
a
feeling
which
was
strong
enough
to
make
captain
corbet
unconscious
of
the
presence
of
any
except
himself
and
to
make
the
boys
stop
short
in
their
advance
and
look
on
in
deep
but
mournful
silence
for
there
just
before
them
and
just
before
the
entranced
gaze
of
captain
corbet
lay
the
antelope
she
was
lying
on
her
side
down
the
steep
slope
of
mud
as
though
with
the
falling
tide
she
had
rolled
over
to
her
ruin
and
destruction
there
she
lay
with
her
side
buried
deep
in
the
soft
mud
her
masts
pointing
downwards
buried
there
and
so
firmly
fixed
in
that
that
the
next
rising
tide
would
only
seem
to
complete
her
hopeless
ruin
there
she
lay
doomed
and
devoted
to
destruction
the
dear
old
antelope
which
had
carried
them
safely
through
all
their
late
adventures
and
around
which
so
many
imperishable
memories
had
fastened
themselves
to
these
boys
of
the
b
who
thus
saw
it
in
the
peril
of
its
last
agonies
the
antelope
was
not
a
common
schooner
it
had
carried
them
safely
through
adventures
which
were
never
to
be
forgotten
in
it
they
had
cruised
over
minas
basin
they
had
visited
the
five
islands
they
had
landed
at
pratt
s
cove
in
it
they
had
drifted
over
the
wide
seas
they
had
run
ashore
they
had
encountered
perils
without
number
in
it
they
had
known
joy
and
sorrow
plenty
and
famine
hope
and
despair
and
this
was
the
end
to
see
the
dear
old
tub
upset
on
the
wrong
side
and
lying
buried
in
mud
creek
before
their
eyes
awaiting
its
inevitable
fate
o
captain
corbet
cried
bart
who
hurried
up
first
to
the
figure
on
the
stone
wall
o
captain
corbet
can
nothing
be
done
to
save
her
captain
corbet
turned
his
face
and
looked
mildly
yet
calmly
upon
the
boys
his
calmness
extended
itself
to
them
and
they
thought
that
it
was
the
calmness
of
hope
in
a
moment
their
sorrow
over
the
antelope
passed
away
but
the
words
of
captain
corbet
did
not
tend
to
inspire
hope
no
shook
his
venerable
head
with
deep
solemnity
no
said
he
nothen
ken
be
done
you
see
i
hurried
home
to
see
the
babby
an
i
didn

fasten

she
stood

but
it
was

mournfully

more
earnestly
than

you
captain
corbet
shook
his
head
solemnly
then
looking
earnestly
at
the
boys
he
slowly
ejaculated
no
go
boys
that
there
schooner
s
a
gone
sucker
the
tone
in
which
captain
corbet
uttered
these
words
was
one
of
such
quiet
despair
that
none
of
the
boys
had
anything
to
say
they
all
felt
that
he
knew
best
besides
he
was
most
directly
concerned
in
the
loss
of
the
antelope
and
if
he
gave
up
then
there
was
no
hope
for
them
then
also
they
had
offered
their
services
and
captain
corbet
had
declined
them
what
more
could
they
do
nothing
more
that
was
evident
so
they
listened
in
mournful
silence
to
his
last
words
yes
said
captain
corbet
impressively
she
s
a
gone
sucker
an
it
was
o
ny
my
fault
i
d
ort
to
hev
tied
her
up
but

i

how
it

he
resumed
as
the
boys
stood
round
him
in
respectful
silence
full
of
sympathy
for
his
loss
i
see
how
it
is
it
s
the
finger
of
providence
you
see
he
continued
with
a
deeper
solemnity
you

it

to
show

to

babby
that
s
about
captain
corbet
then
relapsed
into
silence
and
once
more
fixed
his
abstracted
gaze
upon
the
lost
schooner
the
boys
could
do
nothing
and
full
of
respectful
sympathy
they
withdrew
in
silence
and
returned
to
the
hill
it
was
almost
and
all
the
boys
were
out
in
front
of
the
academy
long
was
walking
up
and
down
the
portico
chatting
with
porter
the
b
were
there
engaged
with
the
others
in
the
general
sport
when
suddenly
phil
seized
bart
s
arm
and
pointed
to
the
avenue

he
cried
bart

and
saw
the
familiar
figure
of
captain
corbet
he
was
walking
rapidly
straight
up
towards
the
portico
the
b
at
once
rushed
up
to
him
whar
s
long
said
captain
corbet
who
seemed
very
much
excited
up
there
said
bart
pointing
to
the
portico
captain
corbet
said
no
more
but
hurried
on
in
the
direction
indicated
and
soon
ascended
the
steps
of
the
portico
immediately
in
front
of
long
mr
long
said
he
in
great
agitation

by
his
emotion

the
a
flush

over
captain
corbet
s
pale
face
it
was
not
merely
long
s
promise
to

his
cause
and
see

harmless
but

sympathy

of

the
day
after
mind
don
t
forget
good
and
saying
this
long
dragged
porter
away
from
the
portico
leaving
captain
corbet
muttering
inarticulate
words
about
his
babby
most
mysterious
sound
in
a
most
mysterious
what
is
it
general
the
adventurous
they
are
is
pat
at
the
bottom
of
it
bart
takes
his
life
in
his
hand
and
goes
alone
to
encounter
the
mystery
of
the
the
boys
had
much
to
talk
about
that
night
these
had
been
eventful
times
there
was
their
excitement
about
the
mineral
rod
and
their
memorable
experiment
in
the
cellar
there
was
the
unlading
of
the
stones
and
the
bright
prospect
of
more
holidays
there
was
the
sorrow
of
corbet
over
his
lost
antelope
and
finally
there
was
the
prospect
of
the
approaching
trial
when
long
would
defend
the
cause
of
the
innocent
were
not
these
matters
sufficiently
exciting
to
keep
the
boys
awake
till
a
late
hour
methinks
they
were
above
all
that
roar
which
had
startled
them
at
their
midnight
work
never
ceased
to
perplex
them
bruce
who
was
superstitious
still
clung
to
his
belief
in
its
supernatural
origin
but
the
other
boys
were
one
and
all
convinced
that
it
was
a
hoax
but
who
had
done
it
did
the
perpetrators
of
that
hoax
belong
to
the
school
or
did
they
belong
to
the
village
or
were
they
on
these
points
they
took
sides
and
had
long
arguments
which
led
to
no
conclusion
in
particular
but
left
them
where
they
were
one
conclusion
they
did
come
to
however
and
that
was
to
keep
their
adventure
a
profound
secret
and
wait
to
see
if
the
mystery
would
not
be
revealed
in
spite
of
their
fatigue
they
were
so
excited
by
the
recent
events
that
they
all
remained
in
the
rawdons
rooms
till
quite
a
late
hour
the
academy
was
still
and
everybody
seemed
to
have
gone
to
bed
bart
tom
and
phil
were
about
to
retire
to
their
own
rooms
when
suddenly
there
occurred
something
which
made
every
one
of
them
start
to
his
feet
it
was
a
long
wild
shrill
cry
somewhere
between
a
howl
and
a
hoot
and
it
sounded
in
the
attic
above
before
they
could
recover
from
their
first
shock
it
sounded
again
and
again
bruce
s
face
grew
pale
and
the
others
looked
at
one
another
with
eyes
the
rawdons
rooms
were
in
the
third
story
and
immediately
above
them
was
the
attic
which
ran
the
whole
length
of
the
academy
all
unfinished
except
a
little
chamber
at
this
end
occupied
by
pat
pat
s
room
was
immediately
over
bart
s
and
as
the
academy
was
divided
into
separate
compartments
each
with
its
own
entrance
and
stairways
it
had
no
connection
with
this
part
midway
in
the
unfinished
attic
rose
the
cupola
supported
by
a
network
of
vast
beams
a
favorite
place
of
resort
for
the
boys
on
account
of
the
magnificence
of
the
prospect
which
it
commanded
on
rainy
days
the
attic
formed
a
fine
place
for
exercise
but
at
night
its
vast
and
gloomy
extent
served
rather
to
repel
visitors
such
was
the
place
through
which
now
sounded
that
discordant
and
horrid
cry
which
had
so
startled
the
boys
there
it
is
again
said
bruce
at
last
pooh
said
bart
that
that
is
nothing
to
what
it
was
up
in
the
let
s
go
up
and
see
what
it
is
said
bruce
who
again
as
before
mastered
the
weakness
of
his
superstitious
fear
by
a
supreme
effort
of
courage
all
right
said
the
others
now
s
our
bruce
and
arthur
each
took
a
lamp
and
they
started
off
scarcely
had
they
passed
out
into
the
hall
than
another
of
those
shrill
cries
came
and
at
the
same
time
they
heard
three
peculiar
knocks
they
stopped
for
a
moment
to
listen
as
they
stopped
the
door
opposite
opened
and
jiggins
appeared
he
looked
pale
and
disturbed
what
s
all
the
row
jiggins
asked
bart
row
said
jiggins
i
don
t
know
i
don
t
like
it
at
all
it
don
t
somehow
sound
altogether
right
i
think
you
d
better
not
at
this
moment
jiggins
s
voice
was
drowned
by
another
howl
he
started
and
looked
at
the
others
in
silence
by
this
time
they
heard
below
the
noise
of
doors
opening
and
shuffling
feet
the
voices
of
bogud
and
billymack
and
johnny
blue
and
muckle
were
heard
calling
up
to
them
they
shouted
back
after
which
the
others
came
up
to
the
hall
and
they
all
stood
listening
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
in
the
midst
of
this
other
footsteps
were
heard
and
pat
made
his
appearance
i
ran
out
said
he
an
i
saw
lights
up
here
an
i
came
up
ye
v

bart

room
and
didn
t
i

it

mighty
queer
said
jiggins
i
think

said
david
digg
whatever
it
is
it
s
something
that
we
ought
not
to
nonsense
bogud
said
bart
we
re
going
up
is
it
cried
pat
deed
then
an
ye
d
betther
not
ye
don
t
know
what
it
is
that
s
up
as
he
spoke
there
sounded
once
more
those
peculiar
knocks
many
s
the
time
i
heard
that
said
pat
it
s
a
black
bad
wern
t
you
frightened
asked
bogud
solemnly
sure
it
cudn
t
make
any
differ
whether
i
wor
frightened
or
not
the
likes
of
me
s
got
to
bear
thim
and
now
there
came
another
uproar
it
was
yell
after
yell
so
wild
so
harsh
and
so
discordant
that
the
former
noises
were
nothing
in
comparison
bogud
beat
a
hasty
retreat
and
jiggins
backed
into
his
doorway
the
other
boys
fell
back
a
little
but
the
b
stood
their
ground
and
bruce
put
his
foot
on
the
lowest
step
to
ascend
to
the
attic
sure
ye
ll
not
be
goin
up
said
pat
yes
we
will
said
bart
come
along

boys
cried
phil
as
he
hurried
up
after
bruce
come
pat
it

all

cried
bart
you

t
pretend
to

my
belief
that
you
know
all
about
it
can
t
i
tell
by
your
face
whether
you
re
really
frightened
or
not
me
cried
pat
with
a
very
queer
intonation
that
sounded
like
a
mournful
wail
struggling
with
wild
laughter
is
it
me
o
isn
t
it
to
danger
yere
goin
thin
don
t
blame
me
if
i
didn
t
warrun
ye
s
och
but
it
s
a
black
day
intirely
come
along
boys
he
said
to
the
others
who
were
left
let
s
go
down
out
of
this
to
the
flure
these
last
words
were
not
heard
by
the
b
who
were
by
this
time
in
the
attic
peering
through
the
gloom
and
waiting
for
a
recurrence
of
the
sound
they
listened
for
a
long
time
but
they
heard
no
noise
at
all
no
shrieks
no
knocks
whatever
were
heard
at
length
they
began
to
go
about
they
walked
first
towards
that
end
of
the
attic
where
pat
s
room
was
and
the
only
noise
they
heard
was
the
heavy
footsteps
of
pat
as
he
ascended
the
stairs
and
entered
his
room
it
s
my
firm
belief
said
bart
that
pat
is
at
the
bottom
of
all
this
humbug
of
course
we
won
t
find
anything
there
won
t
be
so
much
as
a
knock
let
alone
a
they
walked
all
about
and
at
last
reached
the
place
where
the
cupola
arose
it
was
built
over
the
main
part
of
the
academy
from
which
wings
extended
on
either
side
this
main
part
was
taken
up
with
the
academy
hall
which
however
did
not
rise
so
high
as
the
floor
of
the
attic
and
the
consequence
was
that
there
yawned
here
a
dark
abyss
some
fifteen
feet
in
depth
and
sixty
or
eighty
feet
square
above
rose
the
stout
timbers
crossing
one
another
in
all
directions
through
the
midst
of
which
ladders
ascended
into
the
cupola
some
loose
planks
laid
across
this
abyss
from
beam
to
beam
formed
a
rather
dangerous
pathway
this
the
boys
traversed
and
crossing
to
the
opposite
side
they
wandered
about
the
long
dark
loft
gazing
curiously
in
all
directions
there
was
no
flooring
on
this
side
but
only
beams
with
the
laths
and
plaster
of
the
lower
rooms
between
them
their
search
took
them
over
this
but
nothing
whatever
came
of
it
they
searched
the
whole
attic
most
thoroughly
but
could
find
nothing
well
boys
said
bart
we
can
t
do
anything
more
for
my
part
i
m
fagged
out
and
i
m
going
to
this
proposal
met
with
the
approbation
of
all
the
others
they
were
all
very
tired
very
sleepy
and
very
much
disgusted
at
their
failure
so
they
went
down
the
steps
and
the
rawdons
went
into
their
room
and
the
others
turned
to
go
down
but
just
at
that
moment
the
yells
and
the
hoots
sounded
out
again
in
a
deafening
volley
then
all
was
still
o
yell
away
cried
bart
angrily
we
ll
find
you
out
some
day
depend
upon
it
boys
pat
s
at
the
bottom
of
it
if
he
is
let
him
look
out
that
s
all
i
ll
teach
him
a
lesson
that
he
won
t
forget
in
a
hurry
come
phil
come
tom
good
by
bruce
and
arthur
if
you
feel
inclined
for
another
hunt
you
may
make
it
yourselves
i
m
going
to
bed
and
i
ll
sleep
till
nine
tomorrow
in
spite
of
all
the
noises
that
can
be
scared
with
these
words
bart
retired
along
with
tom
and
phil
and
he
kept
his
word
for
he
slept
as
sound
as
a
top
and
did
not
make
his
appearance
on
the
next
day
till
long
after
the
other
boys
were
up
after
getting
his
breakfast
from
solomon
he
wandered
out
into
the
grounds
in
front
of
the
academy
where
he
found
nearly
all
the
school
gathered
and
in
a
great
excitement
the
noises
had
been
heard
all
through
the
night
by
most
cf
them
and
had
excited
every
varying
shade
of
superstitious
terror
bogud
had
told
them
about
the
attempt
of
the
b
to
find
out
the
mystery
and
tom
had
been
forced
to
acknowledge
their
failure
all
this
of
course
made
an
immense
sensation
different
theories
arose
among
them
most
of
them
tinged
with
superstition
all
these
theories
referred
to
an
old
legend
that
the
academy
had
been
built
on
a
spot
where
some
french
houses
had
once
stood
and
that
the
cellars
were
beneath
the
building
out
of
this
legend
some
of
the
boys
created
a
wild
theory
which
connected
the
acadians
with
the
hideous
noises
of
the
past
night
jiggins
and
bogud
were
both
inclined
to
this
pat
was
very
industrious
in
going
about
among
the
boys
with
terrific
descriptions
of
what
he
had
heard
and
as
his
room
was
actually
in
the
attic
and
only
separated
from
its
gloomy
extent
by
a
thin
board
partition
his
authority
was
considered
sufficient
for
any
belief
however
wild
pat
in
fact
was
a
great
man
that
day
and
fairly
revelled
in
the
faces
of
the
small
boys
as
they
questioned
him
about
his
experience
these
small
boys
all
lived
in
another
building
called
the
boarding
house
which
stood
near
the
academy
but
apart
from
it
and
as
they
listened
to
pat
s
wild
stories
they
congratulated
themselves
that
they
were
not
within
hearing
of
such
terrific
sounds
bart
heard
all
this
he
watched
the
effect
which
this
story
had
produced
and
he
saw
how
pat
was
glorifying
himself
on
this
occasion
i
tell
you
what
it
is
boys
said
he
to
his
friends
as
they
found
themselves
together
apart
from
the
others
in
all
this
school
there
is
one
and
only
one
that
knows
about
this
row
and
that
is
pat
i
m
sure
of
it
if
i
had
a
doubt
before
it
s
vanished
now
why
look
at
him
over
there
frightening
the
small
boys
out
of
their
wits
well
he
continued
after
a
pause
very
well
just
wait
a
while
and
see
if
i
don
t
pay
up
pat
for
as
soon
as
bart
could
do
it
unobserved
he
went
up
to
explore
the
attic
he
spent
a
long
time
there
and
did
not
come
down
till
the
dinner
bell
rang
then
after
dinner
he
went
up
again
and
spent
the
afternoon
his
investigation
was
long
and
searching
but
what
he
found
and
where
he
found
it
and
how
he
found
it
and
in
fact
whether
he
found
anything
at
all
or
not
he
did
not
tell
to
a
single
soul
no
not
even
to
the
b
as
bart
preserved
such
secrecy
i
m
sure
i
m
not
going
to
divulge
it
just
yet
i
will
do
as
bart
did
and
keep
my
own
counsel
and
wait
till
the
proper
time
comes
for
the
disclosure
and
any
boy
who
thinks
there
s
going
to
be
a
ghost
in
the

see

the
day
appointed
for
the
hearing
of
captain
corbet
s
case
was
awaited
with
an
excitement
which
was
almost
equal
to
that
which
had
been
created
by
the
affair
in
the
attic
it
was
to
come
off
at
eleven
o
clock
but
the
impatience
of
the
boys
was
not
to
be
restrained
and
long
before
that
time
they
were
all
out
in
front
of
the
academy
gathered
together
in
groups
and
discussing
the
probabilities
of
the
trial
the
wall
had
been
removed
and
put
into
the
schooner
for
ballast
and
carried
away
it
had
been
kept
for
more
than
a
week
that
was
all
undeniable
but
then
on
the
other
hand
it
had
all
been
replaced
so
that
it
was
better
than
ever
that
was
equally
undeniable
how
then
could
the
owner
prosecute
what
damage
had
been
done
in
fact
the
opinion
of
the
boys
was
that
instead
of
prosecuting
he
ought
to
make
the
school
a
present
of
some
kind
say
a
couple
of
barrels
of
apples
in
return
for
their
skill
and
industry
in
rebuilding
his
old
rickety
stone
wall
besides
he
had
no
business
to
prosecute
captain
corbet
long
was
the
guilty
party
why
not
prosecute
him
on
the
whole
it
was
a
question
full
of
interest
and
as
the
appointed
hour
drew
near
its
advent
created
greater
and
greater
excitement
at
a
quarter
before
eleven
the
door
of
porter
s
house
opened
and
out
came
long
followed
by
captain
corbet
while
simmons
and
the
doctor
brought
up
the
rear
their
appearance
was
greeted
with
three
rousing
cheers
by
all
the
boys
and
as
their
respected
teachers
walked
on
towards
the
village
the
entire
school
followed
at
their
heels
in
a
very
irregular
very
disorderly
and
very
noisy
procession
the
place
where
the
trial
was
to
come
off
was
about
half
way
between
the
academy
and
mud
creek
it
was
in
a
small
hall
which
was
built
for
lectures
public
gatherings
tea
meetings
and
so
forth
it
was
now
turned
into
a
court
of
law
and
the
awful
rhadamanthus
who
presided
here
was
a
and
very
popular
villager
who
by
some
singular
freak
of
fortune
had
been
made
a
justice
of
the
peace
his
name
was
pieter
schwab
and
he
was
of
dutch
extraction
he
was
short
round
fat
had
a
bald
head
double
chin
gray
and
somewhat
fishy
eyes
flaxen
hair
pudgy
hands
thick
wheezy
voice
and
though
born
and
brought
up
in
the
country
he
still
spoke
with
that
musical
and
mellifluous
dutch
accent
which
he
had
inherited
from
his
ancestors
as
the
party
from
the
hill
entered
they
found
pieter
schwab
justice
of
the
peace
seated
in
the
chair
of
justice
the
prosecutor
was
there
too
with
a
large
number
of
villagers
who
took
an
intense
interest
in
the
case
and
when
the
boys
crowded
in
the
little
hall
was
crammed
one
cause
of
the
prosecution
indeed
the
only
cause
lay
in
a
certain
kind
of
hostility
which
existed
between
the
village
and
the
hill
it
was
a
sort
of
town
and
gown
feeling
which
was
not
confined
to
the
village
but
spread
over
the
country
and
particularly
gaspereaux
it
was
this
feeling
which
brought
the
villagers
at
the
present
time
to
the
court
of
rhadamanthus
still
there
was
not
so
much
partisanship
on
this
occasion
as
there
would
have
been
if
the
dispute
had
been
directly
between
the
village
and
the
hill
for
captain
corbet
was
the
one
who
was
prosecuted
and
captain
corbet
happened
to
be
a
great
favorite
in
the
village
the
villagers
present
were
therefore
very
uncertain
in
their
sympathies
they
wished
the
hill
to
be
beaten
but
they
didn
t
want
captain
corbet
to
suffer
the
loss
of
the
antelope
which
seemed
by
this
time
far
gone
to
destruction
excited
additional
sympathy
and
as
his
venerable
form
appeared
a
murmur
of
friendly
feeling
went
round
and
a
score
of
horny
hands
were
stretched
out
to
grasp
his
the
suit
against
captain
corbet
was
for
the
recovery
of
damages
incurred
by
the
illegal
violent
malicious
injurious
felonious
dishonest
malignant
mischievous
wanton
secret
forcible
burglarious
and
criminal
removal
of
a
portion
of
the
stone
wall
surrounding
the
potato
field
of
the
prosecutor
whereby
the
said
prosecutor
had
sustained
grievous
harm
and
loss
the
prosecutor
in
setting
forth
his
grievances
stated
that
it
might
have
been
made
a
criminal
action
but
out
of
kindness
to
captain
corbet
he
had
decided
to
make
it
a
civil
one
and
merely
wished
to
have
the
losses
which
he
had
suffered
made
good
the
bill
of
damages
was
a
very
heavy
one
amounting
to
no
less
a
sum
than
five
hundred
dollars
an
amount
which
poor
captain
corbet
could
never
have
paid
and
which
was
perfectly
preposterous
the
knowledge
of
this
excited
a
fresh
demonstration
of
feeling
in
favor
of
the
venerable
defendant
and
at
length
even
before
the
trial
had
fairly
begun
there
was
not
a
villager
present
who
was
not
heart
and
soul
in
favor
of
captain
corbet
the
prosecutor
brought
forward
testimony
to
prove
damages
his
sole
testimony
consisted
of
one
witness
who
was
known
by
the
name
of
old
zeke
a
poor
worthless
character
whose
life
vibrated
between
begging
and
getting
drunk
he
swore
that
on
a
certain
day
he
happened
to
be
down
by
the
creek
and
saw
a
horse
in
the
field
where
the
fence
had
been
removed
long
proceeded
to
examine
this
witness
long
had
a
singularly
keen
and
acute
mind
and
the
witness
was
nothing
in
his
hands
old
zeke
in
a
few
minutes
became
so
confused
that
he
could
not
testify
to
anything
he
said
first
that
the
day
was
tuesday
then
wednesday
then
thursday
then
he
wouldn
t
be
sure
but
that
it
might
be
friday
then
saturday
and
at
length
he
wouldn
t
swear
but
that
it
might
have
been
sunday
finally
he
said
that
he
wouldn
t
swear
to
the
day
at
all
after
this
he
was
so
pressed
by
long
that
he
thought
that
the
horse
might
have
been
a
cow
and
then
he
said
he
wouldn
t
swear
that
it
wasn
t
a
sheep
or
a
goat
or
a
dog
finally
long
asked
him
on
his
oath
if
he
would
swear
that
it
wasn
t
a
rat
and
old
zeke
wouldn
t
swear
that
it
wasn
t
a
rat
old
zeke
s
total
discomfiture
however
was
nothing
to
long
it
was
mere
child
s
play
he
longed
to
close
with
a
worthier
antagonist
with
the
prosecutor
himself
the
prosecutor
swore
that
cattle
had
got
into
his
potato
field
and
had
done
damage
which
he
had
estimated
at
over
five
hundred
dollars
long
now
proceeded
to
grapple
with
the
prosecutor
could
he
prove
damages
to
the
extent
of
five
hundred
dollars
he
could
all
and
how
could
he
prove
that
any
cattle
had
got
in
had
he
himself
seen
any
cattle
no
no
who
then
had
seen
them
old
zeke
old
zeke
very
good
would
the
prosecutor
be
kind
enough
to
state
which
of
the
cattle
that
old
zeke
had
seen
had
done
the
damage
was
it
old
zeke
s
rat
at
this
a
roar
of
laughter
arose
from
the
spectators
who
were
now
in
the
highest
state
of
excitement
and
what
might
have
been
the
value
of
the
potatoes
planted
there
or
how
much
would
it
cost
to
replant
them
two
dollars
or
twenty
over
how
much
ground
had
old
zeke
s
rat
gone
and
how
many
potatoes
had
old
zeke
s
rat
eaten
would
he
swear
that
old
zeke
s
rat
wouldn
t
have
eaten
the
potatoes
even
if
the
wall
had
been
standing
would
he
swear
that
it
was
possible
for
any
one
rat
in
five
or
six
days
to
eat
up
five
hundred
dollars
worth
of
potatoes
in
a
short
time
the
prosecutor
had
got
into
an
awful
state
of
wrath
and
confusion
but
long
was
merciless
and
had
made
up
his
mind
not
to
spare
him
so
he
rang
the
changes
on
old
zeke
s
rat
and
the
potatoes
till
all
the
assembly
were
convulsed
with
laughter
and
the
prosecutor
was
purple
with
fury
and
bewilderment
then
long
changed
his
tone
to
one
of
greater
seriousness
alluding
to
the
prosecutor
s
oath
that
the
damage
had
amounted
to
five
hundred
dollars
he
questioned
him
with
merciless
severity
as
to
how
he
had
made
that
estimate
had
he
dug
up
the
potatoes
to
see
if
they
had
been
injured
no
had
he
ploughed
up
the
field
and
sowed
it
again
no
the
field
remained
then
as
it
had
been
planted
yes
on
his
oath
did
he
or
did
he
not
expect
a
crop
of
potatoes
yes
how
much
was
planted
one
acre
how
much
would
be
raised
about
a
hundred
bushels
how
much
would
they
fetch
about
fifty
dollars
making
allowance
for
expenses
of
digging
what
would
be
the
value
about
forty
dollars
all
these
replies
were
wrung
out
from
the
prosecutor
only
by
extreme
pressure
he
felt
that
he
was
in
a
bad
position
and
struggled
hard
against
it
his
face
grew
red
and
big
drops
of
perspiration
rolled
down
over
his
forehead
forty
dollars
long
thundered
out
and
yet
you
swear
to
five
hundred
dollars
damage
you
prosecute
an
aged
a
virtuous
and
an
estimable
and
you
dare
to
take
an
oath
against
him
to
such
a
frightful
untruth
what
is
this
is
it
malice
or
what
but
if
malice
what
is
there
that
could
ever
have
been
done
against
you
by
one
so
and
so
true
and
honest
as
captain
corbet
all
this
produced
a
tremendous
effect
on
the
spectators
on
the
prosecutor
and
on
rhadamanthus
but
now
long
came
down
harder
than
ever
upon
the
unfortunate
prosecutor
he
declared
himself
ready
to
prove
that
captain
corbet
never
took
away
the
stone
fence
at
all
this
was
easily
done
first
every
one
of
the
boys
was
summoned
to
give
his
simple
statement
of
the
facts
the
whole
truth
came
out
and
it
was
clearly
shown
that
captain
corbet
must
have
been
in
total
ignorance
of
the
whole
transaction
to
the
testimony
of
the
boys
was
added
that
of
simmons
and
he
with
all
the
rest
alluded
in
touching
terms
to
the
occupation
of
the
captain
while
the
stone
wall
was
disappearing
stone
walls
captain
corbet
touch
them
why
he
was
nursing
his
baby
at
home
all
the
time
as
the
boys
came
forward
one
by
one
captain
corbet
looked
at
them
and
listened
in
eager
attention
with
a
smile
of
love
on
his
meek
and
venerable
face
as
they
spoke
of
his
absence
from
the
scene
that
smile
broadened
into
one
of
deeper
affection
but
finally
as
they
spoke
of
his
occupation
of
his
home
of
that
morning
when
they
found
him
there
with
his
baby
it
was
too
much
his
heart
beat
fast
a
flood
of
tender
recollections
thronged
into
his
memory
tears
started
to
his
eyes
but
what
could
he
do
nothing
he
could
only
grasp
the
hands
of
those
who
stood
nearest
and
wring
them
and
murmur
broken
words
yes
sir
that
s
so
that
s
all
gospel
truth
it
s
jest
so
i
wasn
t
nigh
the
schewner
it
was
the
babby
him
it
was
i
was
a
nussin
of
him
an
a
feedin
of
him
an
a
singin
an
a
hummin
to
him
an
i
knowed
nothin
more
about
that
thar
stone
wall
than
the
man
in
the
and
all
these
words
of
captain
corbet
together
with
the
simple
statements
of
the
boys
combined
to
strengthen
the
convictions
of
the
villagers
that
the
poor
captain
was
a
deeply
injured
man
now
of
all
these
circumstances
which
tended
to
establish
captain
corbet
s
perfect
freedom
from
all
possible
blame
long
was
not
neglectful
of
a
single
one
he
gathered
them
all
up
in
his
mind
and
after
all
the
witnesses
had
been
examined
prepared
to
hurl
them
with
tremendous
force
at
the
head
of
the
miserable
and
now
almost
prosecutor
long
was
a
man
of
magnificent
presence
leonine
in
aspect
and
impressive
in
manner
he
joined
to
these
advantages
a
wonderful
acuteness
of
thought
and
a
copious
flow
of
eloquent
language
besides
he
was
stung
by
the
cowardly
act
of
the
prosecutor
who
attacked
poor
captain
corbet
instead
of
attacking
himself
who
was
the
real
culprit
if
there
were
any
culprit
and
so
he
determined
to
read
that
man
a
lesson
which
he
would
always
remember
and
prepared
to
pour
out
all
the
full
vials
of
his
wrath
upon
his
miserable
head
no
damage
whatever
had
been
done
or
could
have
been
done
and
yet
this
man
tried
to
ruin
captain
corbet
out
of
petty
spite
that
was
enough
for
long
he
began
by
a
severe
review
of
the
prosecutor
s
statements
and
a
still
more
severe
criticism
of
his
charges
for
damages
old
zeke
s
rat
was
once
more
brought
out
for
the
benefit
of
the
village
audience
and
light
jesting
was
mingled
with
scathing
denunciation
old
zeke
himself
did
not
escape
and
long
asked
his
hearers
to
judge
what
kind
of
a
cause
it
was
which
had
need
of
such
a
witness
then
he
showed
the
enormous
difference
between
the
utmost
value
of
the
potatoes
even
if
all
were
spoiled
and
the
charge
made
by
the
prosecutor
the
fact
that
the
prosecutor
had
sworn
to
five
hundred
dollars
damage
was
enlarged
upon
in
indignant
language
which
accused
that
prosecutor
of
nothing
less
than
perjury
then
taking
all
these
facts
together
he
sought
for
a
motive
and
could
find
nothing
else
than
extreme
avarice
or
excessive
malignity
and
against
whom
against
captain
corbet
one
of
our
oldest
most
virtuous
most
respected
and
most
venerable
citizens
one
whose
character
had
never
before
been
impeached
one
who
was
loved
and
revered
by
all
who
never
had
a
quarrel
who
had
never
made
an
enemy
and
who
had
never
stood
in
a
court
of
law
before
until
this
day
at
this
there
was
an
immense
sensation
the
boys
and
the
villagers
mingled
together
in
crowding
near
to
captain
corbet
in
order
to
show
their
sympathy
with
his
unmerited
woes
and
who
was
captain
corbet
he
asked
at
length
against
whom
this
ruinous
charge
had
been
made
this
was
a
question
full
of
interest
for
it
led
him
to
consider
the
character
of
the
defendant
he
alluded
to
his
many
virtues
his
reputation
his
popularity
he
touched
also
in
gentle
terms
upon
his
recent
loss
in
the
destruction
of
the
antelope
and
by
skilfully
intermingling
the
excellences
of
captain
corbet
with
his
afflictions
he
excited
still
more
the
commiseration
of
his
hearers
finally
he
considered
the
testimony
as
to
the
actual
occupation
of
captain
corbet
while
the
fence
was
being
taken
away
he
knew
nothing
whatever
about
it
said
long
absolutely
nothing
he
was
not
there
he
was
far
away
where
was
he
where
was
this
man
who
has
been
charged
with
being
a
trespasser
and
a
thief
where
was
this
man
who
has
been
accused
of
removing
his
neighbor
s
landmarks
and
laying
waste
his
neighbor
s
fields
where
long
paused
for
a
moment
and
his
eyes
looked
all
around
over
the
crowd
and
finally
settled
upon
the
frightened
face
of
the
unhappy
prosecutor
where
was
he
repeated
long
again
he
paused
perhaps
with
a
slight
feeling
of
regard
for
the
poor
prosecutor
perhaps
on
the
other
hand
with
a
desire
to
make
his
speech
more
effective
perhaps
carried
away
by
his
own
eloquence
and
merely
seeking
the
most
appropriate
language
with
which
to
clothe
his
vehement
thoughts
perhaps
because
he
faltered
for
an
instant
before
he
should
say
what
was
in
his
mind
to
say
where
was
he
he
repeated
once
more
where
why
all
the
time
far
away
from
the
schooner
from
the
wharf
and
from
the
stone
wall
ignorant
of
everything
that
was
going
on
thinking
of
far
different
things
seated
in
his
own
house
on
his
own
chair
by
his
own
fireside
yes
alone
and
engaged
in
what
i
have
heard
him
call
a
parent
s
fondest
joy
not
stealing
arway
a
stone
wall
no
but
administering
in
the
seclusion
of
his
own
home
to
the
necessities
of
his
offspring
supplying
nutriment
to
his
ah
infant
ah
in
fact
ah
nursing
with
his
own
hands
his
ah
his
baby
long
stopped
abruptly
he
saw
captain
corbet
making
a
violent
effort
to
get
near
to
him
but
he
avoided
him
and
the
venerable
navigator
had
to
pour
out
his
feelings
to
others
who
stood
nearer
the
end
of
it
all
was
that
the
case
was
dismissed
and
the
prosecutor
had
to
pay
costs
though
that
was
not
much
and
captain
corbet
was
for
a
short
time
the
hero
of
the
village
and
of
the
hill
as
he
came
forth
they
all
cheered
him
with
united
voices
and
about
two
hundred
consisting
of
men
and
boys
shook
hands
with
him
and
all
the
boys
marched
along
with
him
nearly
all
the
way
to
his
home
and
then
they
went
to
the
hill
and
spent
the
remainder
of
the
day
in
discussing
the
famous
trial
and
every
one
of
them
from
bruce
down
to
the
smallest
boy
of
the
primary
department
was
in
a
state
of
frenzy
about
captain
corbet
and
long
vii
valley
of
the
gasper
invading
the
enemy
s
returning
home
to
find
their
own
territory
the
the
missing
where
are
they
the
gaspereaugians
the
next
night
the
noises
in
the
attic
were
renewed
bart
lay
calmly
slumbering
and
remained
undisturbed
but
all
the
rest
of
the
boys
were
very
greatly
excited
they
turned
out
of
their
rooms
and
talked
with
one
another
in
the
halls
and
most
of
them
passed
a
sleepless
night
tom
and
phil
who
roomed
near
bart
knocked
at
his
door
to
rouse
him
he
got
up
opened
the
door
and
declared
that
they
had
better
go
back
to
bed
he
assured
them
that
it
was
a
hoax
and
that
pat
was
probably
at
the
bottom
of
it
for
his
part
he
was
sleepy
and
wouldn
t
bother
himself
about
it
that
night
at
any
rate
so
tom
and
phil
seeing
his
indifference
went
back
to
bed
and
fell
asleep
bruce
and
arthur
however
being
close
under
the
attic
were
more
disturbed
and
after
trying
in
vain
to
sleep
they
rose
took
a
lamp
and
went
up
into
the
attic
jiggins
again
met
them
as
they
came
out
of
their
room
at
his
door
but
declined
going
up
so
the
two
brothers
went
up
together
and
looked
around
for
some
time
without
finding
anything
while
they
were
up
there
the
noises
ceased
but
after
they
had
gone
down
disgusted
with
this
second
failure
the
noises
were
renewed
but
familiarity
breeds
contempt
and
bruce
himself
had
lost
his
superstitious
fear
he
was
convinced
that
it
was
a
hoax
and
so
he
felt
only
irritated
at
the
noise
having
failed
to
discover
the
cause
both
he
and
arthur
went
to
bed
and
for
the
rest
of
the
night
in
spite
of
the
noises
they
slept
soundly
on
the
following
morning
bruce
proposed
a
walk
to
gaspereaux
all
acceded
to
this
proposition
except
bart
he
did
not
care
about
going
he
had
several
things
he
said
which
he
wished
to
attend
to
after
vain
efforts
to
persuade
him
to
accompany
them
an
arrangement
was
finally
made
that
he
should
meet
them
at
the
camp
at
four
o
clock
this
bart
acceded
to
and
promised
to
bring
provisions
enough
to
supply
them
all
with
a
bounteous
and
a
generous
repast
the
school
was
all
alive
that
morning
with
excitement
nothing
was
talked
of
nothing
thought
of
but
the
unaccountable
noises
in
the
attic
again
as
before
the
theories
of
superstition
were
put
forth
again
as
before
jiggins
and
bogud
shook
their
heads
solemnly
over
the
matter
and
declared
that
there
was
something
serious
in
it
again
as
before
pat
went
around
among
the
boys
giving
a
terrific
account
of
his
own
experience
and
expatiating
upon
the
hardships
which
he
had
to
undergo
in
living
in
a
room
which
was
close
to
that
place
of
horror
the
attic
but
in
spite
of
his
professed
fear
pat
did
not
seem
to
suffer
in
bodily
health
in
any
way
his
appetite
was
as
good
his
complexion
as
ruddy
and
his
spirits
as
active
as
ever
and
all
the
boys
as
they
heard
his
terrific
experience
wondered
how
he
could
stand
it
so
well
immediately
after
breakfast
bruce
and
the
other
boys
started
off
for
gaspereaux
leaving
the
whole
school
in
this
wild
state
of
excitement
bruce
at
the
breakfast
table
had
entered
into
an
argument
with
jiggins
about
the
noise
in
the
attic
in
which
he
maintained
the
theory
that
it
was
a
hoax
by
somebody
jiggins
on
the
other
hand
boldly
asserted
that
the
noises
were
supernatural
and
announced
his
belief
that
it
was
done
by
some
wandering
frenchman
who
had
been
exiled
at
the
expulsion
of
the
acadians
and
would
never
be
at
rest
till
the
school
should
be
given
up
bogud
billymack
johnny
blue
sammy
ram
ram
and
pat
supported
jiggins
while
muckle
bart
arthur
tom
and
phil
sustained
bruce
the
argumentation
was
tremendous
but
as
usual
resulted
in
nothing
since
each
was
resolved
to
maintain
his
own
opinion
of
those
who
thus
argued
two
only
understood
the
case
the
one
was
pat
who
said
a
great
deal
on
his
side
of
the
question
the
other
was
bart
who
only
made
an
occasional
remark
and
created
a
vague
surprise
by
his
general
reserve
he
was
usually
outspoken
and
positive
but
now
he
contented
himself
with
general
remarks
and
indistinct
hints
but
though
bart
said
little
on
this
occasion
he
kept
his
eyes
open
and
observed
much
he
noticed
pat
s
demeanor
in
particular
and
marked
the
eager
volubility
with
which
he
supported
jiggins
s
theory
this
only
strengthened
his
belief
that
pat
was
as
he
said
at
the
bottom
of
it
and
made
him
more
determined
than
ever
to
concoct
some
plan
which
should
bring
pat
to
confusion
and
force
him
to
a
confession
such
avas
the
state
of
things
when
bruce
avith
his
friends
started
off
to
gaspereaux
leaving
bart
behind
them
with
the
understanding
that
he
should
join
them
with
provisions
at
the
camp
at
four
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
they
took
with
them
and
anticipated
a
day
of
sport
the
valley
of
the
gaspereaux
lay
about
a
mile
behind
the
academy
and
was
one
of
the
most
beautiful
places
in
all
that
beautiful
country
the
river
has
its
origin
in
several
lakes
which
are
only
a
few
miles
away
from
the
sea
and
after
flowing
from
these
between
lofty
hills
and
over
precipices
where
it
falls
in
picturesque
cataracts
it
winds
its
way
onward
towards
the
basin
of
minas
on
either
side
arise
steep
slopes
and
through
the
narrow
valley
between
these
the
river
winds
it
is
only
a
small
stream
in
many
places
easily
fordable
and
the
numerous
trout
at
certain
seasons
make
it
a
favorite
resort
for
the
angler
the
narrow
valley
is
dotted
with
trees
and
groves
the
borders
of
the
little
stream
are
lined
with
willows
the
soil
is
exceedingly
fertile
and
amid
the
foliage
of
trees
and
the
green
vegetation
the
cottages
of
the
farmers
and
the
tapering
spires
peep
forth
with
a
picturesque
beauty
which
adds
new
charms
to
this
romantic
spot
a
road
winds
down
one
side
of
the
valley
and
up
the
other
and
this
road
crosses
the
stream
by
a
bridge
which
forms
a
central
spot
from
which
the
eye
may
wander
over
a
landscape
which
for
soft
and
quiet
loveliness
may
be
equalled
by
few
and
surpassed
by
none
of
those
which
in
other
climes
have
been
celebrated
by
the
poet
or
the
artist
but
to
venture
into
this
delightful
valley
was
not
so
safe
for
the
boys
of
the
grand
pré
school
as
was
desirable
to
go
there
was
to
penetrate
into
an
enemy
s
country
and
to
encounter
all
the
dangers
of
such
an
enterprise
for
the
feud
which
raged
between
town
and
gown
extended
over
to
gaspereaux
and
the
boys
of
this
valley
were
the
chief
enemies
of
the
school
the
winter
was
the
great
season
for
campaigning
and
then
many
were
the
fights
which
took
place
between
the
hostile
parties
during
the
other
seasons
there
was
a
kind
of
truce
the
gaspereaugians
were
generally
busy
on
their
farms
and
no
pitched
battles
occurred
still
at
any
season
it
was
not
pleasant
for
any
one
belonging
to
the
school
to
find
himself
alone
in
gaspereaux
for
this
reason
they
generally
went
in
parties
sometimes
also
the
gaspereaugians
would
invade
the
academy
woods
and
commit
various
depredations
such
as
breaking
the
dams
or
tearing
down
the
camps
such
was
the
state
of
things
at
this
time
along
the
crest
of
the
hill
that
separates
gaspereaux
valley
from
grand
pré
there
ran
a
road
originally
made
by
the
french
acadians
and
known
as
the
ridge
road
a
drive
along
this
affords
a
series
of
the
most
magnificent
prospects
imaginable
and
it
was
a
favorite
walk
for
all
connected
with
the
school
bruce
and
his
companions
did
not
descend
at
once
into
the
valley
but
turned
up
the
ridge
road
and
walked
along
for
some
distance
at
last
they
descended
through
the
woods
into
the
upper
part
of
the
valley
and
came
to
the
river
it
was
quite
shallow
and
the
boys
walked
up
its
bed
stepping
from
stone
to
stone
and
occasionally
taking
to
the
bank
as
they
came
to
some
deep
spot
they
all
had
brought
rods
and
lines
and
at
length
varied
their
pursuits
by
fishing
they
found
plenty
of
by
turning
up
stones
here
and
there
phil
was
most
successful
for
he
succeeded
in
hooking
seven
very
fine
trout
bruce
caught
four
arthur
three
and
tom
five
at
length
they
grew
tired
of
fishing
and
as
they
felt
hungry
they
made
a
fire
and
cooked
the
trout
on
the
coals
they
had
no
salt
but
they
found
the
old
proverb
to
be
true
that
hunger
is
the
best
seasoning
and
so
being
excessively
hungry
they
all
found
the
broiled
trout
delicious
amusements
and
occupations
like
these
took
up
many
hours
and
so
the
time
passed
till
at
length
they
began
to
think
of
returning
they
decided
to
go
back
through
the
valley
and
beard
the
lion
in
his
den
by
facing
the
gaspereaugians
in
their
own
retreat
off
they
all
started
then
and
taking
the
road
they
walked
along
down
the
valley
at
every
step
they
expected
to
encounter
the
enemy
but
to
their
surprise
no
enemy
appeared
the
boys
whom
they
saw
from
time
to
time
were
too
small
to
deserve
notice
reaching
at
last
the
place
where
the
road
wound
up
the
hill
and
went
to
grand
pré
they
turned
aside
and
strolled
along
to
the
centre
of
the
village
this
was
where
the
bridge
crossed
the
river
it
was
a
beautiful
place
an
island
lay
midway
and
just
above
the
bridge
was
another
island
here
they
staid
for
some
time
and
fished
but
no
fish
appeared
what
was
still
more
wonderful
no
gaspereaugians
appeared
either
they
could
not
account
for
it
they
felt
disappointed
it
seemed
like
a
slight
after
waiting
as
long
as
they
could
they
had
to
turn
away
at
last
and
it
was
with
something
like
indignation
that
they
started
back
to
the
academy
the
rest
of
the
journey
was
uneventful
but
when
they
reached
the
camp
in
the
woods
where
they
expected
to
meet
bart
a
strange
and
startling
sight
met
their
eyes
the
brook
ran
along
through
a
little
dell
and
on
either
side
the
banks
arose
by
the
camp
the
bank
on
one
side
was
steep
and
covered
with
trees
but
the
other
side
a
little
lower
down
was
a
gentle
slope
bare
of
trees
and
green
with
short
soft
grass
and
on
this
place
bruce
and
his
companions
saw
a
crowd
of
boys
standing
regarding
them
with
hostile
faces
and
apparently
bent
on
mischief
they
were
the
gaspereaugians
the
gaspereaugians
now
they
understood
it
all
this
then
was
the
reason
why
they
had
gone
through
gaspereaux
unmolested
they
had
not
been
troubled
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
gaspereaugians
had
themselves
been
off
on
a
foray
and
this
was
their
enterprise
they
wondered
what
had
become
of
bart
and
solomon
and
as
bruce
thought
of
this
a
dark
frown
came
over
his
face
and
he
stood
looking
at
the
gaspereaugians
like
a
viii
and
solomon
fall
into
an
ambush
and
after
a
desperate
resistance
are
made
bonds
and
bruce
and
the
a
challenge
a
conflict
and
a
immense
sensation
among
the
the
prisoners
burst
their
their
recovery
of
the
spoils
of
meanwhile
bart
and
solomon
had
been
having
their
own
little
adventure
they
had
left
the
academy
at
half
past
three
so
as
to
have
everything
ready
for
the
boys
by
four
o
clock
for
this
purpose
solomon
carried
a
basket
of
provisions
filled
with
those
multiform
and
very
attractive
dishes
which
his
rare
culinary
genius
never
failed
to
create
whenever
a
fitting
occasion
demanded
it
so
they
ascended
the
hill
and
crossed
the
old
french
orchard
and
descended
into
the
gully
and
went
up
the
other
side
into
the
woods
and
then
walked
along
the
path
towards
the
camp
suddenly
as
they
came
to
a
place
where
the
path
turned
to
the
left
there
was
a
loud
shout
and
in
an
instant
they
were
surrounded
by
some
twenty
or
thirty
boys
the
boys
were
rough
and
wild
they
were
dressed
in
homespun
they
were
burly
fellows
and
they
threw
themselves
violently
upon
bart
and
solomon
bart
struggled
bravely
but
what
could
he
do
against
so
many
in
his
desperate
struggles
he
managed
to
knock
down
one
or
two
of
them
but
before
long
he
was
lying
down
first
on
his
back
and
then
on
his
face
and
his
hands
were
tied
behind
him
then
he
was
allowed
to
get
up
he
did
so
and
found
himself
none
the
worse
for
the
fight
which
he
had
been
indulging
in
a
pang
however
came
to
his
generous
heart
as
he
saw
solomon
with
his
hands
tied
and
another
pang
also
as
he
saw
two
of
the
gaspereaugians
carrying
off
the
basket
with
all
its
precious
store
of
provisions
but
in
spite
of
his
situation
bart
did
not
for
a
moment
lose
heart
couldn
t
you
have
managed
it
with
less
than
thirty
he
said
quietly
to
the
gaspereaugians
wouldn
t
twenty
have
done
to
attack
me
and
old
solomon
the
gaspereaugians
looked
sulky
at
this
ten
i
should
say
resumed
bart
ten
gaspereaugians
ought
to
be
enough
for
one
of
us
and
if
so
why
bring
thirty
answer
me
that
you
won
t
very
well

something

gave

a
snowball

set
my
nose
bleeding
for
half
an
hour
and
that
i
think
was
about
the
only
blood
that
was
shed
in
all
our
bart
spoke
with
such
jolly
carelessness
and
such
good
humor
that
his
fun
was
contagious
and
the
gaspereaugians
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
even
the
big
fellow
who
had
threatened
him
joined
in
the
laugh
and
a
murmur
went
round
among
them
to
the
effect
that
this
prisoner
wasn
t
a
bad
fellow

occasionally
rheumatic
african

not
a
common
person
he
s
a
grand
o
you
panjer
danjer
yerself
an
see
how
you
like
it
growled
the
big
gaspereaugian
who
felt
some
slight
fear
that
bart
was
making
fun
of
him
see
here
said
bart
since
you
ve
tied
us
up
hadn
t
you
better
tie
up
that
basket
of
provisions
too
if
you
haven
t
got
any
cord
you
may
take
what
i
this
was
received
with
roars
of
laughter
to
which
bart
listened
with
unaltered
placidity
meanwhile
as
bart
had
been
speaking
he
had
been
trying
his
fetters
and
found
them
not
so
tight
but
that
he
could
work
his
hands
free
his
jests
about
their
tying
his
hands
made
the
gaspereaugians
ashamed
to
secure
them
more
tightly
some
of
them
indeed
were
in
favor
even
of
untying
him
but
bart
had
been
hurriedly
bound
and
his
hands
were
small
so
that
to
slip
them
through
the
bonds
was
not
a
work
of
difficulty
he
soon
found
out
this
but
kept
his
own
counsel
and
held
his
hands
rigidly
behind
him
as
though
they
were
bound
too
tightly
to
be
moved
as
he
spoke
he
looked
all
around
watchfully
so
as
to
see
his
chances
of
escape
to
slip
his
hands
was
easy
whenever
he
chose
had
it
been
himself
alone
that
was
concerned
he
would
have
made
a
dash
into
the
woods
and
could
have
easily
eluded
pursuit
but
he
could
not
leave
solomon
and
so
he
waited
in
the
hope
that
some
favorable
juncture
might
arrive
when
he
could
free
his
companion
also
the
gaspereaugians
now
led
them
away
across
the
brook
that
ran
by
the
camp
and
took
up
their
station
on
the
other
side
on
that
smooth
slope
which
has
already
been
mentioned
bart
and
solomon
were
put
inside
of
a
hut
of
spruce
which
some
of
the
boys
had
been
building
through
the
interstices
of
the
branches
they
could
see
the
camp
of
the
b
perfectly
well
it
was
not
far
away
and
the
gaspereaugians
were
debating
whether
to
go
and
pull
it
down
now
or
to
wait
until
some
more
boys
might
come
in
the
midst
of
this
debate
bruce
came
upon
the
scene
with
his
companions
and
they
after
looking
hastily
around
had
found
themselves
in
the
presence
of
the
invading
host
there
stood
bruce
in
full
view
of
bart
and
solomon
his
brows
lowering
darkly
and
menacingly
and
a
stern
interrogation
in
his
face
before
which
the
gaspereaugians
as
first
seemed
to
quail
what
do
you
want
here
you
fellows
said
bruce
at
last
there
was
no
reply
for
nearly
a
minute
the
eyes
of
all
the
gaspereaugians
were
fixed
upon
the
speaker
but
no
one
answered
at
this
moment
bart
finding
himself
unobserved
slipped
his
hands
out
of
their
bonds
and
quickly
untied
those
of
solomon
now
sol
he
said
there
s
going
to
be
a
row
this
is
our
chance
when
i
start
you
follow
but
don
t
start
till
i
do
mind
now
yes
s
r
said
solomon
with
his
usual
grin
i
m
yours
till
def
slave
or
free
live
or
dead
sure
s
a
gun
an
ebber
faitful
and
now
bart
looked
all
around
waiting
for
a
chance
to
start
the
gaspereaugians
had
forgotten
all
about
their
prisoners
other
things
far
more
exciting
presented
themselves
there
stood
bruce
and
once
more
his
lordly
and
imperious
voice
rang
out
what
are
you
fellows
doing
here
away
with
you
all
every
one
of
you
bruce
was
tall
and
and
stout
and
muscular
his
hat
sat
loosely
on
his
head
and
his
hair
clustered
in
careless
curls
about
his
broad
forehead
his
eyes
seemed
to
flash
and
his
thin
nostrils
quivered
with
disdain
he
looked
like
a
statue
of
apollo
as
he
stood
there
in
the
glow
of
his
youthful
strength
and
beauty
and
faced
down
his
enemies
their
very
numbers
instead
of
overawing
him
only
served
to
rouse
to
the
utmost
the
whole
vigor
of
his
soul
and
stirred
up
his
proud
bold
spirit
to
a
scornful
a
movement
now
took
place
among
the
gaspereaugians
and
murmurs
passed
through
them
at
length
the
big
fellow
who
had
been
so
fierce
with
bart
went
forward
from
out
the
crowd
of
his
companions
to
the
place
where
bruce
was
standing
by
the
pool
of
the
camp
he
was
a
big
hulking
clumsy
fellow
with
a
heavy
gait
and
sullen
face
he
was
taller
and
stouter
than
bruce
and
evidently
considered
himself
the
champion
of
his
party
as
he
approached
bruce
stood
with
folded
arms
regarding
him
while
his
lips
curled
into
a
smile
well
he
said
in
a
gay
and
careless
tone
what
can
i
do
for
you
the
big
fellow
clambered
up
the
dam
and
stood
in
front
of
bruce
whar
s
bruce
rawdon
he
said
looking
round
and
pretending
not
to
know
that
he
was
there
before
him
whar
s
this
bruce
rawdon
that
youns
brag
on
put
him
down
here
fur
i
want
to
hev
a
trial
with
him
i
want
to
my
good
fellow
said
bruce
i
m
bruce
rawdon
and
i
m
quite
at
your
service
only
you
are
mistaken
if
you
think
that
we
brag
on
any
one
we
re
not
a
bragging
the
gaspereaugian
looked
at
him
and
made
a
ridiculous
grimace
so
this
is
bruce
rawdon
said
he
this
here
wal
rawdon
let
s
wrastle
we
ll
decide
who
s
the
best
man
on
y
take
care
of
your
close
my
fine
feller
i
m
generally
considered
rough
yes
rough
as
a
bar
that
s
what
i
all
right
said
bruce
quietly
and
in
a
minute
he
had
flung
off
his
hat
coat
and
waistcoat
i
ll
keep
my
duds
on
said
the
gaspereaugian
on
y
that
that
s
by
way
of
defyin
and
saying
this
he
flung
his
hat
on
the
ground
upon
this
the
two
champions
prepared
to
grapple
the
place
where
they
stood
was
a
grass
plot
on
one
side
of
the
pool
the
pool
was
full
to
the
brim
the
b
stood
on
the
dam
the
gaspereaugians
stood
about
twenty
paces
off
it
was
a
moment
of
intense
excitement
for
a
few
seconds
they
stood
with
extended
arms
warily
regarding
one
another
then
bruce
made
a
plunge
forward
and
before
the
other
could
guard
against
it
he
had
caught
him
around
the
waist
under
his
arms
bruce
had
got
the
the
two
were
now
locked
in
a
close
embrace
and
for
a
few
moments
the
big
gaspereaugian
made
tremendous
efforts
to
throw
his
antagonist
but
the
efforts
were
unsuccessful
bruce
did
not
exert
himself
much
but
quietly
evaded
the
efforts
of
the
other
and
still
held
his
adversary
in
an
unrelaxing
grasp
the
gaspereaugians
now
began
to
look
anxious
bruce
s
face
was
so
calm
his
action
was
so
quiet
he
seemed
to
make
so
little
effort
in
spite
of
the
immense
exertions
of
his
antagonist
that
he
appeared
to
show
some
vast
reserve
of
strength
in
store
ready
to
be
put
forth
at
some
sudden
moment
the
gaspereaugian
was
in
truth
a
big
burly
fellow
whose
muscles
had
been
developed
by
a
life
of
hard
labor
on
a
farm
but
he
was
slow
and
clumsy
and
ignorant
of
all
skill
in
wrestling
now
bruce
was
an
adept
in
almost
every
active
sport
while
his
limbs
were
so
admirably
knit
and
his
muscular
development
was
so
splendid
that
even
on
the
score
of
brute
strength
he
soon
gave
evidence
that
he
overmatched
the
other
at
the
same
time
he
made
it
apparent
that
his
strength
was
only
half
put
forth
the
gaspereaugians
grew
more
anxious
every
moment
while
arthur
tom
and
phil
who
had
never
for
an
instant
doubted
the
result
felt
their
excitement
increasing
to
an
unendurable
degree
bruce
soon
showed
what
his
idea
had
been
in
these
manoeuvres
he
had
now
worked
himself
around
so
that
his
back
was
towards
the
pool
and
the
gaspereaugian
had
made
one
violent
effort
to
push
him
in
backwards
it
was
in
vain
bruce
stood
like
a
rock
then
suddenly
as
the
gaspereaugian
s
efforts
slackened
somewhat
bruce
flung
his
right
arm
around
him
lower
down
and
by
one
quick
and
tremendous
effort
of
strength
raised
him
up
into
the
air
in
an
instant
the
fellow
s
legs
spun
upward
he
appeared
to
turn
a
back
summerset
and
then
down
he
went
all
sprawling
on
his
back
with
his
arms
and
legs
extended
wildly
straight
into
the
pool
no
sound
of
joy
or
sorrow
arose
from
either
bank
but
friends
and
foes
in
dumb
surprise
with
parted
lips
and
straining
eyes
stood
gazing
where
he
thus
far
the
two
prisoners
had
remained
in
confinement
they
might
easily
have
escaped
their
hands
were
free
and
no
one
was
paying
any
attention
to
them
but
they
remained
there
solomon
would
not
go
till
bart
led
the
way
and
bart
was
too
tremendously
excited
by
the
struggle
to
think
of
moving
he
stood
there
rooted
to
the
spot
staring
with
intense
interest
at
last
the
end
came
and
as
bart
saw
the
gaspereaugian
s
legs
go
tossing
up
and
saw
him
fall
splashing
into
the
pool
he
touched
solomon
and
followed
by
him
he
darted
into
the
thick
shrubbery
the
basket
of
provisions
stood
there
neglected
this
bart
seized
as
he
passed
and
gave
it
to
solomon
after
this
they
made
a
circuit
to
get
to
the
camp
meanwhile
the
discomfited
wrestler
had
scrambled
to
his
feet
in
the
pool
of
water
and
stood
for
a
time
up
to
his
waist
sputtering
blowing
and
gasping
for
breath
the
boys
stood
looking
on
and
bruce
watched
him
quietly
not
knowing
whether
the
struggle
would
be
renewed
or
not
but
the
gaspereaugian
did
not
make
any
advances
towards
resuming
the
conflict
he
himself
had
been
foiled
so
completely
in
his
most
desperate
efforts
and
the
tremendous
strength
of
those
arms
which
had
raised
him
in
the
air
and
flung
him
into
the
pool
was
so
formidable
to
his
imagination
that
he
was
not
at
all
inclined
for
another
trial
the
one
trial
had
sufficed
so
he
slouched
off
with
his
sulky
face
bent
down
and
soon
joined
his
crestfallen
companions
scarcely
had
he
joined
them
than
a
shout
was
heard
near
the
camp
bruce
and
the
other
boys
turned
and
to
their
delight
and
surprise
saw
bart
and
solomon
with
the
basket
of
provisions
hurrah
cried
arthur
why
bart
we
were
afraid
you
d
come
to
so
we
did
said
bart
we
were
captured
we
re
escaped
prisoners
of
captured
prisoners
of
war
cried
bruce
yes
said
bart
how
about
an
hour
ago
we
came
up
and
fell
into
an
but
how
did
you
manage
to
get
away
upon
this
bart
told
them
all
about
it
and
his
story
was
received
with
unbounded
delight
and
gave
rise
to
no
end
of
fun
what
was
best
was
the
fact
not
merely
that
they
had
escaped
but
that
they
had
brought
off
the
basket
also
in
safety
suddenly
bart
looked
at
his
watch
brethren
of
the
b
said
he
it
s
only
sixteen
minutes
after
four
thus
after
so
many
adventures
after
ambushes
fights
and
captivities
we
have
succeeded
in
keeping
our
appointment
and
are
not
more
than
sixteen
minutes
behind
upon
this
solomon
carried
the
basket
into
the
camp
and
the
others
followed
and
prepared
to
take
their
lunch
as
coolly
as
if
nothing
had
happened
this
was
too
much
for
the
gaspereaugians
it
was
a
bitter
mortification
for
them
to
witness
the
defeat
of
their
companion
it
was
equally
aggravating
to
see
their
prisoners
reach
their
friends
carrying
with
them
their
basket
and
all
this
reached
its
climax
when
they
saw
the
quiet
preparations
for
a
lunch
they
stood
in
that
state
of
mind
and
body
which
is
expressed
by
the
remarkable
word
but
what
could
they
do
hostilities
did
not
seem
to
be
very
attractive
now
for
the
defeat
of
their
champion
had
greatly
changed
the
aspect
of
affairs
to
stand
there
stupidly
looking
on
was
also
not
quite
the
thing
they
had
come
to
indulge
in
a
general
triumph
over
the
school
and
this
was
the
end
they
hesitated
for
some
time
and
stood
in
doubt
but
their
indecision
was
at
last
ended
their
champion
walked
off
silently
and
sulkily
and
they
seeing
the
leader
go
slowly
filed
away
after
him
and
so
omnes
gaspereaugienses
ix
banquet
begun
but
suddenly
the
off
in
search
of
keeping
watch
at
the
old
french
another
boar
and
another
soliloquies
of
sudden
amazing
paralyzing
and
utterly
confounding
one
deep
dark
dread
mystery
stands
revealed
in
a
familiar
but
absurd
the
boys
now
began
a
very
pleasant
repast
in
their
camp
solomon
had
as
usual
done
justice
to
the
occasion
he
had
chickens
turkeys
mince
pies
and
other
articles
too
numerous
to
mention
the
boys
had
enough
to
talk
about
for
bart
had
to
narrate
again
the
story
of
his
captivity
and
bruce
had
to
give
an
account
of
their
wanderings
through
the
valley
of
the
the
departure
of
the
invading
host
was
viewed
by
the
boys
without
any
demonstrations
of
excitement
whatever
they
tried
to
act
as
though
they
were
perfectly
indifferent
to
their
movements
and
having
gained
the
solid
results
of
a
victory
they
did
not
care
to
heighten
its
brilliancy
by
any
vain
display
of
triumph
the
triumph
that
was
in
their
hearts
was
enough
they
knew
also
that
the
would
feel
an
additional
mortification
when
they
reached
home
for
then
they
would
there
learn
that
bruce
and
his
party
had
penetrated
to
the
very
centre
of
their
territory
and
had
virtually
done
defiance
by
lingering
so
long
by
the
bridge
by
that
memorable
exploit
the
camp
in
the
woods
had
now
become
hallowed
henceforth
it
was
to
bear
in
their
eyes
the
charm
of
historic
associations
they
felt
that
their
labor
in
building
it
had
not
been
in
vain
in
truth
it
was
a
pleasant
spot
and
apart
from
any
other
associations
its
own
quiet
beauty
was
sufficient
to
give
it
strong
attractions
its
walls
arose
above
them
surmounted
by
its
roof
all
interwoven
with
the
fragrant
balsamic
branches
of
fir
trees
they
had
chosen
fir
in
preference
to
others
for
the
reason
that
the
spines
of
the
fir
branches
will
cling
for
months
before
drooping
whereas
the
hemlock
the
spruce
the
pine
and
most
other
trees
of
that
kind
are
of
such
a
nature
that
their
spines
will
not
cling
to
the
severed
branch
for
much
more
than
a
week
and
here
were
the
dark
green
walls
cool
and
shadowy
and
fragrant
over
the
floor
was
a
thick
deep
carpeting
of
soft
moss
suitable
for
a
seat
or
for
a
couch
outside
all
the
scene
was
shut
in
by
the
lofty
trees
which
bordered
the
little
dell
just
behind
them
the
brook
bubbled
and
babbled
over
rocks
and
pebbles
till
it
fell
into
the
pool
the
pool
itself
their
handiwork
was
not
the
least
of
the
attractions
its
waters
were
deep
enough
to
bathe
in
and
made
a
pleasant
contrast
to
those
surrounding
trees
which
it
reflected
in
its
mirrorlike
surface
farther
down
the
brook
passed
on
bordered
on
one
side
with
trees
and
on
the
other
by
that
grassy
knoll
where
late
the
beleaguering
gaspereaugians
had
stood
on
it
went
past
the
trees
past
the
knoll
through
underbrush
and
mosses
until
at
length
it
was
lost
to
view
in
the
forest
but
amid
all
these
beauties
the
one
object
which
was
dearest
to
the
b
was
that
which
they
had
fixed
over
the
door
as
at
once
a
memorial
of
the
past
and
a
stimulus
to
adventurous
deeds
in
the
future
it
was
the
jaw
of
the
big
fish
they
had
for
a
while
been
undecided
as
to
its
destination
and
were
on
the
point
of
giving
it
to
the
museum
but
at
last
decided
on
placing
it
there
there
it
accordingly
was
grinning
pleasantly
with
its
triangular
teeth
and
inviting
every
one
to
enter
thus
they
were
seated
at
their
lunch
with
solomon
a
little
apart
looking
at
them
like
a
father
engaged
in
pleasing
conversation
upon
all
the
topics
which
their
recent
varied
adventures
might
suggest
recounting
the
past
enjoying
the
present
and
speculating
on
the
future
when
suddenly
there
came
an
interruption
which
in
a
moment
put
a
full
stop
to
everything
it
was
a
distant
sound
now
a
distant
sound
must
have
been
very
peculiar
to
have
caused
such
excitement
as
this
very
well
this
was
very
peculiar
it
was
a
harsh
dissonant
roar
a
noise
in
fact
that
could
not
be
called
a
roar
exactly
but
something
half
way
between
a
roar
and
a
howl
repeating
itself
over
and
over
and
pealing
from
afar
upon
their
startled
ears
in
tremendous
echoes
there
was
no
mistaking
that
sound
it
was
the
same
as
the
one
that
had
so
startled
them
on
the
memorable
night
of
the
and
had
sent
them
flying
in
confusion
from
the
spot
the
boys
all
looked
at
one
another
with
glances
of
deep
meaning
not
one
of
them
was
frightened
now
solomon
was
only
curious
in
him
the
broad
day
destroyed
any
superstitious
feeling
had
it
been
dark
he
would
have
been
as
terrified
as
he
was
before
the
noise
was
repeated
over
and
over
as
they
listened
and
at
last
it
ceased
it
sounded
like
the
conglomeration
of
the
bellow
of
a
bull
the
roar
of
a
lion
the
yell
of
a
madman
and
the
shriek
of
a
intermixed
with
other
harsh
and
discordant
noises
that
can
scarcely
be
defined
and
the
whole
result
was
one
which
can
certainly
not
be
likened
to
anything
at
all
that
settles
it
said
bart
at
last
what
asked
tom
well
i
ve
been
giving
the
gaspereaugians
the
credit
of
that
row
at
the
and
when
they
came
i
was
certain
of
it
but
this
shows
that
they
could
have
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
it
s
over
there
between
us
and
the
academy
and
sounds
now
in
the
direction
of
the
now
s
the
time
to
find
it
out
said
bruce
i
was
going
to
propose
a
watch
to
see
if
we
could
get
at
the
bottom
of
it
this
is
lucky
for
we
can
examine
it
by
it
s
the
very
same
noise
said
arthur
o
there
s
no
doubt
about
it
said
phil
only
it
s
farther
off
that
night
the
roar
seemed
to
burst
forth
just
behind
me
it
s
the
same
in
kind
only
less
in
degree
as
simmons
come
along
then
boys
said
bart
don
t
let
s
lose
any
time
it
must
be
somewhere
about
the
old
french
orchard
hurry
up
and
with
these
words
they
all
started
off
de
gracious
cried
solomon
where
you
gwine
to
you
won
t
find

i

frow

my
office
i
won
t
be
a
granpander
any
but
the
boys
hurried
away
and
solomon
s
voice
sounded
upon
the
empty
air
thereupon
he
began
collecting
the
dishes
and
eatables
and
replacing
them
in
his
basket
leaving
solomon
thus
the
boys
hurried
on
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
the
mystery
had
thus
far
weighed
heavily
on
all
their
spirits
in
bruce
it
may
have
been
superstitious
feeling
which
made
it
oppressive
to
him
but
in
the
others
it
was
the
mortification
of
their
retreat
and
panic
and
the
unpleasantness
of
not
being
able
to
account
for
the
cause
the
sounds
as
far
as
they
could
judge
seemed
to
come
from
the
old
french
orchard
but
bruce
insisted
that
it
issued
from
the
woods
this
formed
the
subject
of
loud
debate
among
them
as
they
went
on
the
majority
however
were
against
bruce
and
thought
that
it
was
farther
away
than
the
limit
of
the
woods
can
it
be
any
of
the
boys
after
all
said
bart
as
they
went
along
the
path
can
pat
have
in
his
possession
any
very
remarkable
kind
of
or
pat
nonsense
said
arthur
do
you
think
that
any
power
of
pat
s
could
produce
such
a
noise
o
i
don
t
know
he
may
have
a
private
pocket
steam
engine
and
occasionally
let
off
steam
to
amuse
you
ll
have
to
hunt
farther
than
pat
said
bruce
seriously
why
man
alive
cried
bart
you
don
t
think
now
that
there
s
anything
in
it
do
you
bruce
said
nothing
they
all
hurried
along
the
path
peering
into
the
woods
as
they
went
on
and
listening
for
a
renewal
of
the
sound
but
there
was
none
at
length
they
reached
the
gully
and
crossing
it
they
ascended
the
steep
slope
on
the
other
side
this
brought
them
to
the
old
french
orchard
and
to
the
very
cellar
which
had
been
the
scene
of
their
memorable
midnight
operations
looking
down
into
the
cellar
they
could
see
the
traces
of
their
work
very
plainly
they
had
filled
in
the
hole
as
well
as
they
could
but
the
ground
bore
visible
marks
of
having
been
turned
up
if
any
of
the
fellows
have
been
up
here
said
bart
they
must
have
noticed
i
don
t
think
that
follows
said
phil
they
wouldn
t
notice
it
in
my
o
don
t
you
believe
that
the
marks
of
digging
there
are
enough
to
make
any
fellow
notice
well
what
if
they
do
said
bruce
they
ll
never
think
that
we
had
anything
to
do
with
it
so
we
needn
t
bother
our
heads
about
the
fact
is
said
arthur
none
of
them
have
been
up
here
since
they
got
back
bogud
and
billymack
have
been
studying
pat
has
been
occupied
on
the
hill
and
the
others
have
taken
to
the
dikes
we
re
the
only
fellows
that
have
been
here
at
for
my
part
said
bart
i
should
like
to
try
that
hole
again
i
don
t
believe
there
s
anything
there
but
at
the
same
time
i
don
t
like
to
leave
a
thing
unfinished
especially
where
it
s
been
broken
off
the
way
this
was
and
what
s
more
i
m
bound
to
have
another
turn
at
and
so
am
i
said
phil
and
i
said
arthur
i
ll
be
there
said
tom
well
boys
i
ll
be
there
too
said
bruce
and
we
ll
omit
solomon
this
time
and
captain
corbet
we
may
as
well
do
it
by
of
course
said
bart
it
s
all
humbug
to
dig
at
night
it
s
ten
times
as
much
trouble
and
then
we
lose
our
sleep
we
can
come
up
early
some
morning
and
do
it
at
the
same
time
i
m
glad
we
had
that
night
it
s
something
to
look
back
that
s
all
very
well
said
phil
but
i
d
like
to
know
why
we
can
t
hear
that
noise
again
if
it
came
from
this
hole
or
from
the
old
french
orchard
now
s
the
time
for
it
here
we
are
all
ready
so
roar
away
somebody
they
all
sat
down
now
on
the
grass
and
listened
for
a
while
in
silence
they
could
look
over
the
gully
on
one
side
and
part
of
the
on
the
other
on
three
sides
the
woods
encircled
them
running
along
the
on
one
side
where
the
woods
ended
was
a
pasture
field
belonging
to
porter
this
pasture
field
could
not
be
seen
from
the
place
where
they
were
they
sat
here
for
some
time
waiting
for
the
sound
to
arise
again
and
as
they
sat
here
solomon
emerged
from
the
woods
climbed
the
slope
and
advanced
towards
them
he
had
replaced
all
the
dishes
and
all
the
provisions
in
the
basket
and
was
now
carrying
it
back
dar
he
said
as
he
put
it
down
it

can
t
we
go
to
work
here
come
boys
let
s
rise
superior
to
circumstances
and
finish
our
bart
s
proposal
was
greeted
with
a
shout
of
joy
and
once
more
solomon
grinning
with
pride
and
delight
spread
out
before
them
his
dishes
and
eatables
they
had
just
begun
they
had
just
lifted
to
their
still
hungry
and
unsatisfied
mouths
a
morsel
or
two
selected
from
among
the
dainties
spread
out
by
solomon
they
had
just
become
familiar
once
more
with
the
delicious
flavor
of
some
of
his
pet
dishes
when
suddenly
without
warning
and
altogether
unexpectedly
there
burst
forth
again
that
roar
for
which
they
had
been
waiting
so
long
harsh
dissonant
ferocious
resonant
in
its
bellowing
intonations
it
burst
upon
their
ears
now
much
nearer
than
when
they
had
heard
it
at
the
camp
and
seeming
very
nearly
as
loud
as
it
had
been
on
that
eventful
night
the
sound
also
seemed
to
come
from
porter
s
pasture
field
one
moment
they
listened
that
moment
assured
them
of
the
true
direction
the
next
moment
they
flung
down
their
plates
and
knives
and
forks
and
away
they
went
like
madmen
over
the
field
towards
the
pasture
solomon
slowly
rose
to
his
feet
and
looked
after
them
with
his
head
bent
a
little
forward
and
his
hands
clasped
before
him
well
well
well
he
ejaculated
while
an
expression
of
unutterable
disgust
came
over
his
dark
face
well
well
well
ob
all
de
contrairy
chil
en
dat

didn

grumbled
on
as
he
picked

and
put

in
the
basket
tain
t

s
so
he
went
on
picking
up
the
things
growling
and
grumbling
to
himself
all
the
time
until
at
length
he
had
filled
the
basket
again
and
went
off
in
the
direction
where
the
boys
had
gone
to
see
what
had
become
of
them
and
with
a
vague
idea
that
the
dinna
would
be
resumed
somewhere
farther
on
he
found
the
boys
over
in
the
pasture
field
looking
a
little
mystified
the
noises
had
ceased
a
few
cows
were
quietly
grazing
and
among
them
was
an
animal
which
was
very
familiar
by
name
but
which
none
of
them
had
ever
before
seen
in
the
flesh
it
was
a
simple
domestic
animal
in
some
countries
the
most
common
of
all
but
to
these
boys
it
was
a
novelty
how
it
had
got
here
was
also
a
wonder
for
they
had
no
idea
that
it
was
here
and
in
their
surprise
they
forget
about
the
noises
and
what
kind
of
an
animal
might
this
have
been
a
quiet
a
domestic
agreeable
animal
in
fact
only
a
little
donkey
solomon
said
bart
as
he
came
up
who
owns
the
donkey
de
doctor
said
solomon
why
how
in
the
world
did
he
happen
to
get
one
he
bought
yes
but
what
did
he
want
of
it
o
for
de
chil
en
to
play
that
s
queer
i
didn
t
know
there
was
o
you
see
de
doctor
got
him
de
time
you
was
off
on
de
scursium
ole
scissa
grinda
come
long
an
de
doctor
bought
de
donkey
ole
scissa
grinda
beat
de
donkey
so
dat
de
doctor
got
him
an
means
to
keep
him
for
de
chil
en
dat
s
poor
old
neddy
said
bart
he
s
pretty
lean
but
he
s
all
right
now
this
will
be
a
paradise
for
him
but
i
say
boys
i
wonder
how
he
rides
i
ve
never
been
on
a
donkey
s
back
in
my
life
have
you
and
i
never
saw
one
before
said
bruce
i
can
t
say
i
admire
him
well
neither
did
i
for
that
matter
said
bart
and
for
that
very
reason
i
want
to
have
a
ride
on
saying
this
bart
went
up
to
the
donkey
the
patient
animal
did
not
move
but
calmly
went
on
eating
a
delicious
thistle
that
was
under
his
nose
bart
got
on
his
back
the
donkey
ate
on
apparently
unconscious
of
the
weight
bart
caught
hold
of
his
long
ears
and
tried
to
pull
up
his
head
but
the
donkey
ate
on
then
bart
slapped
his
flanks
with
his
hands
but
the
donkey
ate
on
then
bart
kicked
him
vigorously
with
his
heels
but
the
donkey
ate
on
then
he
whistled
and
shouted
and
pulled
his
ears
and
kicked
at
him
and
mixed
all
sorts
of
encouraging
words
with
acts
of
the
most
violent
kind
but
the
donkey
ate
on
that
donkey
seemed
to
be
about
the
most
phlegmatic
animal
that
they
had
ever
met
with
bart
was
in
despair
he
looked
over
the
field
to
see
if
there
was
a
stick
lying
about
anywhere
he
asked
the
boys
if
they
could
see
one
he
now
sat
still
for
a
short
time
on
the
donkey
s
back
waiting
till
he
should
find
a
stick
while
he
was
seated
thus
the
donkey
slowly
lifted
his
head
he
had
finished
that
thistle
and
felt
refreshed
slowly
he
elevated
his
head
slowly
he
threw
back
his
ears
slowly
also
he
elevated
his
tail
until
at
last
his
nose
was
directed
towards
a
point
about
twelve
degrees
above
the
northern
horizon
and
his
tail
to
another
point
about
eleven
degrees
above
the
southern
then
he
spread
all
his
legs
apart
then
he
opened
his
mouth

bart
sprang
from
his
back
the
other
boys
started
and
looked
at
one
another
in
utter
amazement
one
mystery
was
at
last
revealed
x
outburst
of
feeling
from
the
grand
he
enlarges
upon
the
dignity
of
his
spades
digging
once
at
the
old
place
my
resumption
of
an
unfinished
uncovering
the
the
iron
the
cover
of
the
iron
chest
a
tremendous
but
restrained
such
then
was
the
explanation
of
the
mystery
of
the
discordant
the
hideous
roar
to
those
who
have
heard
the
bray
of
a
donkey
it
will
be
intelligible
how
such
a
noise
sounding
suddenly
in
the
still
midnight
to
inexperienced
ears
may
have
been
full
of
terror
while
to
those
who
have
not
heard
it
a
simple
assertion
of
the
above
fact
will
it
is
hoped
be
all
that
is
necessary
it
was
the
donkey
s
bray
which
according
to
the
fable
terrified
the
animals
of
the
forest
after
he
had
put
on
the
lion
s
skin
now
this
donkey
was
clothed
in
something
more
dreadful
than
a
lion
s
skin
he
was
clothed
in
the
darkness
and
the
gloom
of
night
and
his
roar
might
well
terrify
those
who
heard
it
under
such
circumstances
without
knowing
whence
it
came
after
the
first
surprise
they
all
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
it
was
an
immense
relief
to
them
all
but
their
merriment
was
a
little
intermingled
with
feelings
of
shame
as
the
dark
and
dreadful
mystery
thus
resolved
itself
into
the
ridiculous
form
of
a
poor
little
donkey
as
for
solomon
the
effect
produced
on
him
was
greater
than
on
the
others
as
the
first
peal
of
the
bray
struck
his
ears
he
started
his
jaw
dropped
his
eyes
rolled
up
then
as
the
whole
truth
came
to
him
he
dashed
his
hat
to
the
ground
threw
his
head
back
and
burst
into
a
perfect
of
laughter
there
he
stood
while
the
donkey
brayed
swinging
his
aged
frame
and
his
grizzled
head
backward
and
forward
tossing
his
arms
and
at
last
holding
his
aching
sides

solomon
my
son
said
bart
as
the
old
fellow
after
giving
a
wild
yell
was
getting
ready
for
another
outburst
yes
mos
wossfle
said
solomon
with
a
grin
would
it
be
too
much
to
ask
you
to
be
kind
enough
to
allow
us
to
finish
our
rustic
repast
as
it
was
interrupted
by
the
noise
of
this
quadruped
we
think
that
it
would
be
very
desirable
to
resume
it
unless
you
prefer
remaining
here
for
the
rest
of
the
day
imitating
the
animal
before
all
right
mos
possible
said
old
solomon
catching
up
his
basket
couldn
t
help
it
had
to
let
out
strong
bust
if
i
hadn
t
did
so
fust
man
dat
mentions

name
ob
a
donkey
to
me
dis
ole
niggall
bust
dat
s
so
saying
this
solomon
kicked
up
one
leg
then
slapped
one
hand
down
hard
on
his
knee
and
stood
for
a
moment
with
his
head
bent
down
while
his
whole
frame
shook
with
internal
laughter
at
length
he
raised
his
head
and
presented
to
the
view
of
the
boys
a
face
as
grave
as
demure
and
as
solemn
as
the
visage
of
a
judge
who
is
about
to
pronounce
a
sentence
only
there
was
an
irrepressible
twinkle
in
each
of
his
small
black
beads
of
eyes
which
took
a
little
from
the
mask
of
gravity
with
which
his
face
was
covered
then
he
took
up
the
basket
and
walked
back
towards
the
old
french
orchard
the
boys
passed
him
reaching
the
cellar
first
then
they
all
sat
down
again
and
solomon
for
the
third
time
spread
the
table
before
them
dis
heah
said
he
chil
en
am
de
third
and
de
lass
time
ef
any
ob
you
runs
away
he
ll
lose
his
bressed
dinna
now
an
forebbermore
amen
so
you
go
ahead
an
eat
fass
as
you
can
de
visions
ain
t
gwine
to
spile
your
the
boys
were
hungry
and
ate
in
silence
solomon
stood
apart
unobserved
with
a
broad
grin
on
his
face
occasionally
muttering
to
himself
and
shaking
all
over
with
laughter
after
each
of
these
silent
explosions
he
would
suddenly
recover
his
gravity
mutter
to
himself
some
solemn
rebuke
and
look
awfully
grave
for
about
half
a
minute
till
a
new
explosion
came
that
discovery
had
been
too
much
for
him
he
had
seen
the
donkey
when
it
came
but
he
had
never
heard
it
bray
the
terror
over
him
had
been
tremendous
every
night
since
then
had
been
a
night
of
fear
and
it
was
the
violent
revulsion
of
feeling
from
his
former
panic
which
brought
on
this
joyousness
it
took
him
all
the
rest
of
the
term
to
get
over
his
tendency
to
burst
forth
on
all
occasions
into
fits
of
laughter
at
length
the
repast
was
over
and
solomon
at
last
had
the
satisfaction
of
feeling
that
his
efforts
had
been
fully
the
boys
felt
like
giants
refreshed
and
solomon
looked
with
great
complacency
upon
the
bones
of
the
fowls
and
the
empty
dishes
dat
s
about
de
ticket
he
said
as
he
piled
the
dishes

farewell
saying
this
solomon
took
his
basket
and
retired
from
the
scene
there
s
a
great
lot
of
these
cellars
about
said
arthur
at
last
after
some
silence
during
which
they
had
been
sprawling
on
the
grass
beside
the
cellar
there
s
a
great
lot
of
them
i
wonder
how
many
there
are
o
two
or
three
hundred
at
least
said
bruce
perhaps
well
for
my
part
said
bart
i
believe
that
there
s
money
buried
in
some
of
them
and
though
our
adventure
was
awfully
ridiculous
yet
that
doesn
t
alter
the
sober
fact
and
i
think
the
general
belief
is
i
go
in
for
digging
again
said
phil
i
don
t
believe
in
finding
money
but
we
may
find
bones
for
instance
said
bruce
yes
bones
if
you
like
and
then
we
d
give
them
to
the
museum
anything
at
all
would
be
acceptable
it
would
take
the
edge
off
our
disappointment
of
the
other
there
s
a
great
deal
in
that
said
bruce
i
don
t
like
giving
it
up
altogether
said
bart
we
ve
begun
it
let
s
finish
and
there
s
the
hole
said
tom
inviting
us
to
come
besides
said
bruce
don
t
you
remember
we
struck
something
hard
and
i
it
wasn
t
a
no
said
arthur
that
s
a
fact
all
our
shovels
touched
it
we
all
heard
the
dull
ringing
sound
it
gave
it
was
metal
let
s
go
to
work
i
when
said
bart
tomorrow
morning
said
phil
early
no
i
say
said
arthur
so
say
and
all
right
said
phil
i
say
so
too
but
what
ll
we
do
for
shovels
do
why
we
can
go
and
get
some
i
suppose
said
bruce
but
won
t
the
fellows
see
us
what
if
they
do
why
they
ll
wonder
what
we
re
up
what
then
they
ll
follow
us
and
very
well
we
re
not
going
to
work
in
secret
this
time
we
re
working
now
in
broad
day
we
haven
t
any
mineral
rod
nor
any
magic
ceremonies
we
re
merely
a
plain
crowd
not
of
but
of
archaeologists
we
re
not
digging
for
pots
of
gold
but
for
curiosities
and
relics
of
the
acadian
french
that
s
our
position
now
my
boy
and
a
very
much
more
dignified
position
it
is
than
the
one
we
occupied
when
we
were
making
fools
of
ourselves
the
other
so
spoke
bruce
who
felt
more
keenly
than
the
others
the
shame
of
that
panic
for
the
reason
that
he
had
been
more
deeply
touched
since
then
he
had
over
and
over
again
vindicated
his
courage
most
nobly
on
occasions
too
when
the
exercise
of
that
courage
could
only
be
accomplished
by
a
supreme
effort
of
his
strong
spirit
yet
in
spite
of
this
he
felt
galled
at
the
recollection
of
that
night
and
could
not
allude
to
it
without
bitterness
well
said
phil
if
jiggins
and
bogud
and
the
other
lot
are
very
inquisitive
i
ll
invite
them
up
and
we
can
get
them
to
do
the
that
s
a
very
sensible
way
of
viewing
it
said
bart
yes
that
s
just
what
we
ll
do
for
my
part
i
d
rather
have
them
come
than
not
for
if
they
were
to
dig
our
curiosity
would
be
satisfied
all
the
same
while
our
various
muscles
would
not
have
to
submit
to
such
very
violent
exertion
as
is
called
forth
by
the
unpleasant
process
of
digging
with
a
spade
in
such
abominably
hard
well
bart
said
bruce
as
soon
as
you
ve
taken
breath
after
that
sentence
we
ll
up
jumped
bart
at
this
and
the
others
followed
his
example
they
went
down
to
the
academy
and
obtained
spades
and
a
pickaxe
without
any
difficulty
shouldering
these
they
paraded
about
the
yard
in
the
hope
of
attracting
attention
but
to
their
great
disappointment
they
didn
t
attract
any
attention
whatever
the
boys
were
all
away
some
in
front
some
out
for
a
walk
so
they
came
to
the
conclusion
that
they
would
have
to
do
their
own
digging
at
any
rate
said
bart
as
they
walked
back
up
the
hill
one
comfort
is
that
we
dug
up
the
place
before
and
this
time
the
ground
will
be
i
ve
got
the
old
pickaxe
said
bruce
all
ready
in
case
of
whether
we
find
anything
or
not
it
will
satisfy
our
yes
and
then
you
know
we
can
leave
the
hole
open
and
explain
to
the
others
why
we
dug
it
we
can
induce
them
also
to
do
a
little
more
digging
but
if
we
find
anything
there
ll
be
a
still
stronger
temptation
to
o
if
we
find
anything
all
the
cellars
in
the
place
will
be
turned
inside
david
digg
will
have
a
chance
to
prove
himself
deserving
of
his
what
a
joke
it
would
be
if
pat
were
to
see
us
he
d
be
wild
with
curiosity
and
follow
us
so
as
to
o
there
s
no
danger
nobody
ll
come
that
s
just
because
we
want
them
said
phil
chatting
in
this
way
they
marched
up
the
hill
back
again
to
the
old
french
orchard
which
they
reached
without
having
attracted
the
smallest
attention
from
anybody
and
at
length
they
all
stood
once
more
with
their
spades
by
the
cellar
very
different
was
this
occasion
from
the
last
and
they
all
felt
it
so
the
last
had
been
one
of
pure
fun
and
nonsense
disturbed
however
by
the
tremors
of
some
of
their
number
this
time
on
the
contrary
was
an
occasion
in
which
business
seemed
to
predominate
they
paused
for
a
little
while
on
the
edge
of
the
cellar
before
committing
themselves
to
their
work
upon
this
bart
began
to
whine
out
through
his
nose
a
doleful
ditty
to
the
tune
of
auld
lang
syne
whene
er
i
take
my
walks
abroad
how
many
holes
i
see
but
how
they
came
upon
the
ground
completely
puzzles
me
here
once
the
peaceful
frenchman
dwelt
and
passed
his
happy
days
in
draining
bogs
devouring
frogs
and
cultivating
maize
these
holes
no
doubt
were
dug
by
him
we
see
them
all
around
and
all
grand
pré
to
me
appears
a
very
holy
that
s
what
captain
corbet
would
call
a
hime
said
phil
with
a
laugh
it
s
too
solemn
bart
for
this
occasion
we
want
something
then
here
goes
said
bart
who
had
a
happy
talent
for
improvising
and
he
droned
out
the
following
in
a
whining
voice
but
to
a
livelier
measure
over
minas
s
bay
came
the
french
to
grand
pré
and
they
all
were
remarkable
fellers
they
lived
upon
frogs
and
they
wore
wooden
clogs
and
preserved
their
potatoes
in
there
said
arthur
that
s
enough
bart
if
we
don
t
stop
you
now
you
ll
go
on
till
sundown
if
we
re
going
to
dig
we
d
better
begin
for
it
s
getting
late
and
it
ll
be
dark
before
we
know
all
right
my
son
said
bart
here
goes
come
and
seizing
his
spade
he
rushed
down
into
the
cellar
and
plunging
it
deep
into
the
earth
he
began
to
throw
it
out
hurrah
bart
cried
bruce
dig
away
old
man
you
ll
turn
up
the
whole
cellar
at
that
rate
before
we
can
get
down
leave
something
for
us
though
just
for
the
name
of
the
thing
you
come
along
cried
bart
throwing
out
his
seventh
shovelful
by
this
time
they
were
all
at
the
hole
and
plunged
in
their
spades
out
flew
the
earth
in
their
zealous
work
the
shovels
clashed
against
one
another
furiously
and
rather
impeded
their
progress
but
in
spite
of
this
the
earth
was
thrown
out
with
a
rapidity
that
contrasted
in
a
very
striking
manner
with
the
slowness
of
their
progress
on
that
former
occasion
then
the
earth
was
rigid
and
hard
bound
with
the
turf
that
had
been
accumulating
for
generations
and
bruce
s
pickaxe
had
to
prepare
for
the
slow
entrance
of
their
spades
but
now
their
spades
went
in
easily
and
the
pickaxe
as
yet
was
not
needed
but
the
work
of
digging
was
an
unusual
one
and
their
violent
efforts
exhausted
them
before
they
had
worked
for
a
long
time
they
paused
for
a
moment
and
rested
we
re
almost
at
the
bottom
said
bart
that
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
the
bottom
said
arthur
well
i
mean
we
re
almost
as
far
down
as
we
were
but
i
wonder
whether
we
shall
strike
that
metallic
substance
that
we
struck
before
said
arthur
i
ll
soon
see
said
bruce
saying
this
he
took
the
pickaxe
and
giving
it
a
swing
brought
it
down
into
the
centre
of
the
hole
it
penetrated
a
short
distance
and
then
stopped
short
with
a
low
dull
sound
as
though
it
had
struck
something
hard
that
sound
roused
the
boys
once
more
and
stimulated
them
to
fresh
exertions
they
again
plunged
their
spades
into
the
earth
all
their
first
energy
was
now
restored
they
forgot
their
fatigue
something
was
there
they
knew
what
it
was
they
could
not
tell
but
they
knew
that
it
must
be
the
same
thing
that
had
excited
them
once
before
and
from
which
they
had
been
driven
by
the
sudden
bray
of
that
absurd
donkey
now
all
that
nonsense
had
been
explained
and
they
knew
that
this
last
vestige
of
the
mystery
of
that
midnight
hour
lay
beneath
them
and
would
soon
be
exhumed
and
brought
to
the
light
of
day
lower
and
lower
they
went
and
now
their
shovels
struck
it
at
every
stroke
it
seemed
metallic
the
dull
ringing
sound
given
forth
could
not
come
from
wood
or
brick
or
stone
it
must
be
metal
but
what
was
it
a
pot
or
an
iron
chest
pooh
at
any
rate
they
were
glad
that
the
other
fellow
s
were
not
present
such
thoughts
and
feelings
passed
through
their
minds
as
they
came
down
nearer
to
the
object
of
their
search
xi
and
farther
down
and
sudden
revelation
of
the
rising
superior
to
the
pot
of
money
and
other
buried
they
take
all
these
exhumed
treasures
to
dr
singular
reception
of
the
excited
in
deep
excitement
they
continued
to
dig
in
silence
and
thus
came
gradually
nearer
to
the
object
of
their
search
at
last
the
loose
earth
was
all
thrown
out
and
only
the
old
hardbound
soil
was
left
while
there
at
the
bottom
of
the
cavity
lay
exposed
a
portion
of
an
iron
surface
dented
now
and
scratched
by
the
blows
which
it
had
received
it
was
very
rusty
the
rust
in
fact
covered
it
in
great
scales
showing
that
it
must
have
been
buried
there
for
many
years
as
yet
only
a
few
square
inches
of
the
surface
were
visible
and
it
was
impossible
to
tell
as
yet
what
it
was
but
they
all
felt
sure
that
it
was
an
iron
chest
bruce
now
took
his
pickaxe
and
began
loosening
the
earth
that
surrounded
the
hole
it
s
lucky
it
s
so
near
the
surface
said
bart
i
suppose
he
hadn
t
time
to
bury
it
any
deeper
said
phil
no
said
arthur
he
must
have
been
hurrying
off
you
perhaps
we
won
t
be
able
to
lift
it
said
tom
what
ll
we
do
then
we
ll
have
to
get
solomon
and
captain
corbet
said
phil
for
that
matter
said
bart
we
can
rig
up
blocks
and
pulleys
and
hoist
it
up
we
ll
have
to
dig
all
around
it
we
may
not
have
it
done
if
it
s
very
heavy
we
won
but
we
o
yes
it
wouldn
t
do
to
leave
it
till
can
t
we
get
lights
if
we
do
get
lights
we
d
better
postpone
it
till
but
we
ought
to
do
as
much
as
we
can
by
o
of
course
while
the
daylight
lasts
we
ll
keep
at
bruce
now
laid
down
his
pickaxe
and
they
went
to
work
with
their
shovels
and
at
last
the
loose
earth
was
thrown
out
once
more
they
had
now
uncovered
what
seemed
like
one
side
of
the
top
of
the
box
and
its
edge
was
plainly
apparent
the
rest
of
it
was
still
covered
by
the
superincumbent
soil
that
s
the
edge
of
the
box
said
bart
we
didn
t
hit
it
fair
in
the
it
s
a
box
and
it
ll
be
awfully
i
wonder
if
it
is
much
we
d
better
uncover
the
rest
of
it
so
as
to
see
the
size
of
it
there
don
t
seem
to
be
any
kind
of
rivets
here
or
anything
of
that
o
you
can
t
tell
it
s
so
covered
with
countersunk
rivets
on
an
iron
plate
would
be
quite
concealed
if
they
were
all
covered
with
scales
of
come
i
ll
dig
more
on
this
side
said
bruce
taking
up
his
pickaxe
again
a
few
blows
directed
against
the
other
side
served
to
loosen
the
earth
there
and
the
eager
boys
soon
threw
it
out
and
laid
bare
more
of
the
surface
bruce
worked
away
with
his
pickaxe
at
the
same
time
there
was
now
room
for
only
two
to
work
the
others
looked
on
with
beating
hearts
hallo
cried
bruce
suddenly
what
asked
bart
why
the
top
s
loose
loose
hurrah
we
can
lift
it
off
then
and
get
into
the
bruce
said
nothing
but
stooped
down
bart
who
had
been
digging
stooped
down
too
the
other
boys
crowded
around
bruce
dug
his
fingers
into
the
earth
by
the
edge
of
the
iron
and
rattled
it
with
his
hands
then
he
tried
to
lift
it
up
it
moved
as
it
moved
he
worked
his
fingers
underneath
it
and
raised
it
up
on
its
edge
he
said
not
one
word
but
lifted
it
up
and
held
it
before
the
eyes
of
the
b
and
as
they
looked
at
it
they
were
struck
dumb
and
stood
paralyzed
with
amazement
and
disgust
for
there
in
bruce
s
hands
held
up
to
the
light
of
day
the
iron
lid
of
the
iron
that
coffer
lid
that
concealed
so
much
treasure
buried
long
ago
by
the
fugitive
frenchman
to
be
exhumed
by
their
fortunate
hands
that
iron
lid
which
had
been
the
source
of
so
much
excitement
and
hope
had
resolved
itself
into
nothing
better
than
rusty
old
ploughshare
again
holding
it
till
he
was
tired
bruce
handed
it
solemnly
to
bart
here
bart
said
he
i
ll
give
all
my
share
to
and
i
present
all
that
you
give
me
and
all
my
own
to
tom
said
bart
taking
it
and
passing
it
on
to
tom
tom
took
it
and
handed
it
to
arthur
i
make
it
over
to
you
arthur
said
he
and
i
make
it
over
to
phil
said
arthur
phil
took
it
very
well
said
he
i
hereby
give
and
bequeath
all
my
right
title
and
interest
in
and
to
the
said
ploughshare
to
the
academy
museum
its
curators
and
officials
to
have
and
to
hold
forevermore
amen
and
anything
to
the
contrary
thereof
in
any
wise
by
this
time
the
boys
had
recovered
from
their
astonishment
disappointment
and
disgust
that
comes
of
being
so
sanguine
said
bart
boys
why
would
you
allow
yourselves
to
grow
so
excited
fancy
a
fugitive
acadian
solemnly
burying
his
it
was
all
he
had
poor
wretch
i
dare
but
why
bury
it
in
his
cellar
why
not
in
his
potato
field
for
my
part
i
don
t
believe
in
the
acadian
i
think
they
re
and
this
is
all
that
remains
of
the
wealth
of
benedict
bellefontaine
the
wealthiest
farmer
in
grand
pré
perhaps
he
intended
it
as
a
quiet
hint
to
show
those
who
were
in
a
hurry
to
get
rich
the
true
source
of
wealth
the
plough
is
that
you
know
so
the
all
say
at
any
well
i
m
glad
we
ve
got
even
this
it
makes
archæologists
of
us
we
ll
make
it
a
present
to
the
museum
the
doctor
ll
be
delighted
perhaps
he
ll
give
us
an
extra
holiday
every
scale
of
rust
will
be
precious
in
his
eyes
and
he
ll
paste
a
nice
label
on
it
with
all
our
names
immortalized
and
the
date
of
the
discovery
it
will
be
the
chief
treasure
of
the
museum
where
ll
david
diggs
s
crystal
be
or
billymack
s
moss
agate
or
jiggins
s
petrifactions
beside
our
plough
i
wonder
if
we
couldn
t
find
something
else
so
as
to
make
a
handsome
thing
out
of
it
an
old
rusty
nail
would
be
better
than
that
s
a
capital
idea
cried
bruce
seizing
his
pickaxe
again
never
say
die
boys
we
ll
go
back
covered
with
glory
after
all
and
our
names
will
be
handed
down
to
future
generations
of
boys
yet
to
come
to
the
old
saying
this
bruce
began
working
away
once
more
with
his
pickaxe
and
the
others
excited
by
this
new
idea
and
the
prospect
of
gaining
some
kind
of
a
reward
for
all
their
toil
took
their
shovels
again
and
waited
till
bruce
should
loosen
the
earth
sufficiently
for
them
to
dig
it
at
length
this
was
done
and
they
began
to
shovel
it
out
they
had
not
worked
five
minutes
before
tom
cried
hallo
here
s
something
at
any
saying
this
he
stooped
down
and
picked
something
out
of
the
ground
which
he
showed
the
boys
they
examined
it
eagerly
and
saw
that
it
was
a
colter
probably
belonging
to
the
plough
from
which
the
ploughshare
had
been
taken
scarcely
had
he
handed
this
to
the
boys
than
he
saw
lying
at
his
feet
an
iron
bolt
this
encouraged
them
all
the
more
the
colter
and
the
bolt
were
placed
beside
the
ploughshare
and
they
worked
on
vigorously
each
one
hoping
to
make
some
discovery
of
his
own
in
a
little
while
bruce
struck
something
which
on
examination
proved
to
be
the
end
of
a
chain
after
diligent
labor
he
succeeded
in
detaching
it
all
from
the
ground
and
laid
it
down
upon
the
grass
it
was
an
ox
chain
about
six
feet
long
this
of
course
only
increased
their
excitement
so
they
all
went
to
work
again
at
last
phil
with
all
his
strength
dragged
something
out
of
the
ground
and
with
a
shout
put
it
down
beside
the
other
things
it
was
a
small
iron
pot
which
had
been
used
for
cooking
it
was
now
full
of
earth
and
phil
seizing
the
colter
began
to
pick
it
out
this
is
the
famous
pot
cried
phil
with
a
laugh
but
the
money
inside
has
all
turned
to
dust
because
we
dug
it
in
the
money
cried
arthur
don
t
laugh
about
money
what
do
you
say
to
that
and
he
held
out
on
his
open
palm
three
very
dirty
coins
what
they
were
they
could
not
tell
whether
silver
or
iron
or
what
they
looked
like
very
dirty
round
stones
the
boys
took
them
and
examined
them
carefully
bart
drew
his
knife
and
scraped
off
the
rust
and
canker
more
of
old
benedict
bellefontaine
said
he
at
last
we
can
t
make
anything
out
of
him
see
here
and
holding
out
the
coin
he
showed
where
he
had
scraped
it
there
they
could
read
faintly
marked
letters
which
formed
the
following
un
sou
they
were
somewhat
disappointed
at
this
and
scraped
the
other
coins
but
found
them
all
copper
pooh
said
arthur
what
s
the
odds
to
an
archaeologist
isn
t
a
copper
coin
as
precious
as
a
gold
one
of
course
it
is
hallo
phil
haven
t
you
got
that
pot
cleaned
out
yet
i
ve
got
an
idea
i
ll
put
these
sous
in
the
pot
and
then
we
can
say
that
we
ve
found
a
pot
of
money
we
ll
be
generous
too
we
ll
give
it
all
to
the
phil
s
pot
by
this
time
was
empty
and
arthur
laughingly
threw
the
sous
into
it
after
this
they
began
their
search
again
and
enlarged
the
hole
in
hopes
of
finding
more
around
the
sides
and
in
this
they
were
successful
for
they
found
near
a
dozen
more
copper
coins
which
made
a
very
respectable
appearance
in
the
pot
and
in
addition
to
these
about
a
dozen
bits
of
iron
nails
spikes
and
bolts
hallo
boys
look
here
cried
bart
suddenly
he
held
in
his
hand
an
old
discolored
bone
talking
about
relics
said
he
here
s
a
relic
of
the
original
owner
the
question
is
though
is
it
a
human
bone
pooh
said
arthur
it
s
an
ox
bone
or
a
not
a
bit
of
it
said
bart
i
m
determined
that
it
shall
be
benedict
it
s
a
horse
s
bone
said
phil
no
said
bart
i
ll
keep
it
carefully
and
let
the
doctor
have
it
it
will
be
the
most
precious
article
in
the
it
was
now
growing
too
dark
to
work
any
longer
the
sun
had
set
and
they
were
satisfied
with
the
result
of
their
labors
so
they
gathered
together
their
treasures
and
set
out
for
the
academy
these
treasures
seemed
to
them
to
be
by
no
means
despicable
they
were
ploughshare
colter
bolts
chain
iron
pot
nails
bits
of
iron
spikes
copper
coins
bone
and
any
one
who
has
ever
been
connected
with
a
small
museum
or
has
ever
been
acquainted
with
those
who
are
connected
with
a
valuable
institution
like
that
will
easily
understand
the
value
of
articles
like
these
exhumed
direct
from
the
cellar
of
an
old
acadian
house
the
boys
felt
no
doubt
whatever
as
to
the
value
of
their
treasure
in
fact
they
grew
so
excited
over
it
that
they
began
at
last
to
think
what
they
had
found
far
better
than
what
they
hoped
to
find
and
so
it
resulted
that
those
who
had
gone
out
to
find
gold
came
back
rejoicing
in
rusty
iron
on
reaching
the
academy
they
went
at
once
to
porter
s
house
they
found
the
doctor
at
home
and
were
ushered
up
at
once
to
his
study
the
boys
said
nothing
but
gravely
and
in
impressive
silence
laid
down
their
treasures
on
the
doctor
s
study
table
it
was
covered
with
books
and
papers
but
they
were
too
oblivious
of
every
thing
and
too
much
absorbed
in
the
contemplation
of
their
own
things
to
think
of
that
so
bruce
entered
first
and
placed
on
the
doctor
s
table
right
over
some
handsome
volumes
of
euripides
just
received
from
london
the
rusty
dirty
old
ploughshare
hallo
cried
the
doctor
why
what
but
before
he
could
finish
his
sentence
tom
came
up
and
laid
down
a
dozen
old
spikes
and
nails
both
of
them
turned
and
looked
proudly
at
the
doctor
look
here
boys
cried
the
doctor
standing
up
what
he
was
interrupted
by
phil
who
came
forward
between
him
and
the
first
boys
carrying
an
iron
pot
which
he
triumphantly
placed
on
a
handsomely
bound
hebrew
lexicon
what
in
the
world
began
the
doctor
again
but
was
again
interrupted
by
arthur
who
solemnly
placed
the
colter
on
a
new
edition
of
longinus
and
then
put
the
chain
on
some
late
english
quarterly
reviews
just
as
the
doctor
was
about
to
burst
forth
bart
came
immediately
before
him
and
with
a
face
radiant
with
delight
laid
down
right
on
the
doctors
blotting
pad
that
horrible
discolored
and
disintegrated
old
bone
illustration
for
a
moment
it
seemed
that
the
doctor
would
burst
forth
in
a
fury
to
him
this
behavior
was
the
sublimity
of
unparalleled
impudence
the
act
was
so
absolutely
unequalled
in
its
quiet
audacity
that
it
actually
made
him
dumb
with
amazement
the
ploughshare
the
colter
the
iron
pot
the
rusty
spikes
and
bolts
the
old
chain
all
these
were
so
many
stages
up
which
his
astonishment
went
to
a
climax
which
was
fully
attained
when
bart
put
down
the
abominable
old
bone
this
was
too
much
then
the
doctor
burst
forth
but
not
in
fierce
and
furious
indignation
and
vehement
and
violent
denunciation
it
struck
him
in
another
way
it
was
his
sense
of
the
ridiculous
that
was
affected
he
forgot
the
ruin
done
to
his
precious
editions
of
the
classics
and
his
mind
could
only
grasp
the
innocent
smiling
faces
of
these
five
young
rascals
who
had
come
into
the
awful
seclusion
of
his
own
study
to
pile
up
his
inviolable
study
table
with
old
iron
and
old
bones
and
so
it
was
that
the
doctor
burst
forth
into
an
uncontrollable
fit
of
laughter
not
a
common
laugh
but
one
which
was
sent
forth
from
the
very
depths
of
his
nature
all
absorbing
overwhelming
peal
after
peal
irrepressible
it
was
contagious
too
the
boys
caught
it
they
tried
to
restrain
themselves
at
first
they
tittered
they
began
to
see
themselves
the
absurdity
of
their
act
the
thought
overcame
them
and
they
all
burst
forth
too
the
whole
company
thus
went
off
into
fearful
explosions
cataclysms
in
fact
of
laughter
it
roused
the
house
the
family
came
running
up
to
see
the
cause
the
doctor
could
not
utter
a
word
tears
were
running
from
his
eyes
he
could
only
point
in
silence
to
the
old
iron
and
old
bone
the
contagion
seized
upon
the
family
also
and
they
all
went
off
into
the
general
laughter
at
length
the
boys
took
the
things
off
the
table
and
put
them
on
the
floor
gradually
the
doctor
recovered
his
and
asked
the
boys
what
it
all
meant
they
told
him
all
about
it
he
listened
to
them
with
a
serious
face
which
however
was
occasionally
disturbed
by
a
tendency
to
another
outburst
as
again
and
again
the
thought
of
the
past
scene
forced
itself
back
finally
he
managed
to
get
the
whole
story
and
by
that
time
his
laughter
passed
and
was
succeeded
by
a
new
sensation
it
was
one
of
intense
delight
at
such
discoveries
now
they
appeared
before
him
not
as
old
iron
and
old
bone
but
in
their
true
character
he
was
an
enthusiastic
antiquarian
and
all
connected
with
the
acadian
french
excited
his
passionate
interest
he
looked
affectionately
at
the
ploughshare
he
handled
the
colter
tenderly
he
examined
one
by
one
with
minute
inspection
the
spikes
and
the
bolt
he
scanned
narrowly
and
admiringly
the
iron
pot
he
passed
every
link
of
the
rusty
chain
through
his
fingers
he
lingered
long
and
lovingly
over
the
coins
closely
examining
every
one
of
them
he
looked
at
the
bone
with
an
intense
curiosity
mingled
with
deep
sympathy
for
the
unfortunate
race
of
which
it
was
the
reminder
he
threw
himself
into
his
admiration
over
these
with
the
same
abandonment
of
feeling
that
had
characterized
his
laughing
fit
it
was
a
proud
and
a
delightful
moment
for
the
boys
when
they
found
that
their
discoveries
were
so
highly
prized
the
doctor
declared
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
museum
to
be
compared
with
them
and
finally
sent
for
simmons
and
long
these
gentlemen
soon
appeared
and
exhibited
an
interest
in
these
acadian
relics
which
was
fully
equal
to
that
of
the
doctor
but
the
wonder
was
to
all
of
them
how
in
the
world
the
boys
had
happened
to
think
of
digging
in
that
particular
place
they
questioned
them
closely
though
good
humoredly
about
this
and
bart
after
vain
efforts
at
eluding
the
questions
finally
told
the
whole
story
bart
told
that
story
in
such
a
whimsical
way
and
with
such
an
eye
to
effective
representation
that
in
five
minutes
he
had
all
his
audience
in
another
roar
of
laughter
worse
than
the
first
he
mimicked
captain
corbet
with
his
mineral
rod
he
told
about
the
lights
and
the
magic
ceremonies
he
took
off
solomon
capitally
and
finally
spoke
of
the
donkey
s
bray
and
its
result
concealing
nothing
of
their
own
terror
bart
went
on
interrupted
all
the
time
by
the
laughter
of
his
hearers
and
at
last
succeeded
in
bringing
his
story
down
to
the
moment
in
which
he
was
speaking
xii
doctor
s
the
expedition
by
the
drive
by
morning
the
north
breakfasting
amid
the
splendors
of
the
illimitable
the
doctor
tells
the
story
of
the
french
boys
said
the
doctor
after
bart
had
ended
his
narrative
it
isn
t
often
that
such
nonsense
as
yours
was
turns
out
so
well
in
the
end
i
d
rather
have
this
old
iron
pot
with
these
old
black
sous
than
even
that
pot
of
gold
which
dazzled
your
imaginations
so
when
you
were
digging
if
all
mineral
rods
were
to
be
so
very
lucky
as
captain
corbet
s
was
we
might
go
and
test
every
old
french
cellar
in
the
country
i
can
assure
you
this
is
a
gift
of
no
common
value
the
rust
marks
and
the
mud
which
you
have
made
on
my
books
and
papers
are
rather
welcome
than
otherwise
bart
s
bone
ought
to
receive
a
very
careful
examination
i
think
we
ought
to
dig
up
the
whole
cellar
and
we
may
find
more
bones
there
but
i
ve
got
a
proposal
to
make
which
perhaps
you
will
think
a
reward
for
your
discovery
is
saturday
how
would
you
like
to
go
off
with
me
on
an
excursion
for
the
day
you
and
the
other
boys
the
same
party
in
fact
that
went
with
long
an
excursion
cried
the
boys
with
radiant
faces
yes
said
the
doctor
i
ve
been
intending
to
make
one
for
some
time
i
was
disappointed
in
not
going
with
you
in
the
schooner
these
relics
have
revived
an
idea
which
i
had
last
year
but
was
not
able
to
put
in
practice
it
is
this
i
have
good
reason
to
believe
that
somewhere
on
the
top
of
blomidon
there
once
stood
a
french
fort
and
that
the
ruins
are
very
distinctly
visible
yet
i
have
a
very
clear
idea
in
my
mind
of
the
exact
locality
and
think
i
can
find
it
without
any
trouble
i
am
very
anxious
to
go
there
and
perhaps
we
can
find
more
french
relics
to
add
to
our
little
stock
in
the
museum
now
my
plan
is
this
i
will
take
my
carriages
and
horses
and
the
whole
party
can
be
accommodated
we
will
take
provisions
for
the
day
we
must
start
as
early
as
four
o
clock
so
as
to
be
at
the
mountain
early
we
can
breakfast
over
there
after
we
have
found
the
french
fort
i
wish
to
have
a
few
hours
for
a
quiet
examination
of
the
cliffs
i
know
some
good
places
for
minerals
and
i
think
i
can
obtain
a
basket
full
without
much
trouble
i
will
see
about
the
baskets
shovels
and
hammers
we
shall
want
a
spade
or
two
and
i
think
under
the
circumstances
we
can
spend
a
very
pleasant
day
now
what
do
you
say
to
that
the
answer
of
the
delighted
boys
came
in
a
perfect
chorus
of
incoherent
and
unintelligible
words
in
which
however
could
easily
be
perceived
the
language
of
intense
excitement
and
of
joyous
assent
very
well
said
the
doctor
you
let
the
other
boys
know
and
remember
you
must
all
be
ready
on
the
spot
by
four
o
clock
morning
not
a
minute
after
this
the
boys
retired
in
great
spirits
to
let
the
others
know
the
good
fortune
that
awaited
them
on
the
morrow
the
following
morning
came
and
all
the
boys
were
on
the
spot
before
the
appointed
time
the
doctor
had
three
double
wagons
ready
drawn
by
six
horses
and
filled
with
provisions
and
all
the
implements
that
might
by
any
possibility
be
needed
it
was
quite
dark
as
yet
but
they
started
in
high
glee
and
as
they
drove
along
it
became
lighter
every
moment
they
all
felt
the
importance
of
the
occasion
no
frolicking
this
time
no
dressing
up
like
scarecrows
no
running
ashore
on
mud
flats
no
getting
lost
in
fogs
no
feeding
on
clams
no
starvation
everything
was
now
to
be
perfectly
regular
perfectly
orthodox
and
rather
dignified
they
were
going
in
the
twofold
capacity
of
archaeologists
and
geologists
to
search
after
the
ruins
of
an
ancient
and
historic
fortress
and
then
to
find
the
mate
of
that
amethyst
which
was
taken
from
here
to
delight
a
king
of
france
at
first
as
they
drove
on
through
the
level
country
all
the
fields
and
woods
around
lay
wrapped
in
shadow
but
as
they
went
on
the
shadows
lessened
and
they
began
to
see
the
first
rays
of
dawn
leaving
the
higher
country
they
at
length
descended
into
the
dike
land
which
they
traversed
and
at
length
reached
the
bridge
that
crosses
cornwallis
river
then
they
went
off
over
the
wide
vale
of
cornwallis
towards
the
north
mountain
on
and
on
the
vale
of
cornwallis
has
five
different
indentations
up
which
the
sea
once
flowed
but
these
are
now
reclaimed
and
here
the
green
and
fertile
meadows
spread
out
where
once
was
red
mud
or
salt
sea
on
the
long
ridges
between
these
diked
districts
are
the
houses
of
the
farmers
and
woods
and
orchards
and
groves
and
gardens
on
every
side
are
the
evidences
of
plenty
and
prosperity
here
and
there
small
villages
appear
the
centre
of
trade
the
roads
are
numerous
running
every
way
and
are
known
by
the
name
of
streets
nowhere
can
a
country
be
found
which
enjoys
a
greater
abundance
of
all
the
richest
gifts
of
nature
a
larger
measure
of
all
that
can
charm
the
eye
or
invigorate
the
body
or
confer
wealth
and
prosperity
nowhere
in
the
world
can
actual
working
farmers
be
found
whose
tables
are
so
loaded
with
varied
and
substantial
dishes
the
cornwallis
farmers
have
not
yet
learned
to
use
everything
that
they
have
for
purposes
of
trade
they
are
satisfied
with
making
money
on
one
or
two
leading
products
but
reserve
their
turkeys
and
chickens
and
cheese
and
hams
and
eggs
and
apples
and
plums
to
weigh
down
their
own
dinner
tables
on
they
went
through
streets
as
they
were
called
which
in
some
places
were
so
closely
bordered
with
houses
that
they
deserved
the
name
past
beautiful
villas
hidden
among
trees
past
rich
orchards
past
long
hedgerows
past
churches
which
pointed
heavenward
their
tapering
spires
on
they
rode
through
busy
little
villages
over
the
broad
dike
lands
whose
rich
green
robe
extended
far
away
on
either
side
along
the
edge
of
deep
mud
gulches
which
were
to
be
filled
by
the
rising
tide
over
roads
where
there
was
not
a
stone
to
be
seen
but
only
that
soft
red
soil
which
makes
such
rich
fields
but
such
wretched
paths
and
still
as
they
went
on
it
constantly
grew
brighter
until
at
last
the
red
sun
bounded
up
into
the
sky
and
threw
his
glow
over
all
the
scene
at
length
they
approached
the
north
mountain
the
place
towards
which
they
went
was
six
or
seven
miles
this
side
of
cape
blomidon
and
the
carriage
road
wound
up
it
on
its
way
to
settlements
on
the
shore
of
the
bay
of
fundy
up
this
road
they
went
and
soon
they
all
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
they
drove
for
a
mile
along
the
ridge
of
the
north
mountain
and
at
length
came
to
a
place
where
the
roadside
was
bare
of
trees
and
the
hillside
sloped
very
abruptly
down
towards
the
plain
it
was
a
place
well
known
to
all
of
them
it
was
a
favorite
resort
for
the
whole
country
on
occasions
of
picnics
or
driving
parties
everything
here
was
familiar
the
brook
where
they
could
get
water
the
big
stone
against
which
they
could
build
their
fire
here
they
drew
up
their
horses
and
prepared
to
take
their
breakfast
the
fire
was
soon
burning
the
kettle
was
filled
with
water
and
was
soon
boiling
the
tea
was
made
and
the
ample
repast
was
spread
out
upon
the
grass
here
they
sat
satisfying
their
hunger
rendered
keen
by
over
two
hours
driving
in
the
fresh
morning
air
chatting
merrily
and
looking
forth
from
their
lofty
seat
upon
one
of
the
most
glorious
views
that
can
be
conceived
in
truth
it
was
a
glorious
prospect
beneath
them
lay
the
plains
of
cornwallis
which
all
stood
revealed
to
their
elevated
position
with
that
peculiar
effect
known
as
a
bird
s
eye
there
the
valleys
spread
away
with
their
intervening
ridges
there
ran
the
long
straight
streets
there
rose
the
villas
embowered
among
trees
the
neat
and
the
tapering
spires
of
churches
the
vivid
green
of
the
dike
land
surrounded
all
this
streaked
here
and
there
by
the
long
lines
of
woodland
that
rose
on
the
low
ridges
dotted
by
groves
and
orchards
and
intersected
by
the
soil
of
the
roads
far
away
on
the
opposite
side
lay
the
slopes
of
grand
pré
with
the
gleaming
white
of
the
houses
dotting
the
green
fields
and
there
were
the
outlines
of
familiar
objects
conspicuous
among
which
was
the
academy
which
rose
immediately
opposite
though
many
miles
away
between
them
the
sea
rolled
its
waters
extending
far
away
towards
the
left
where
the
shores
were
so
low
that
in
one
place
the
sea
and
sky
seemed
to
blend
together
but
in
other
places
the
shores
stood
out
in
bolder
reliefs
and
there
arose
precipitous
cliffs
and
abrupt
bluffs
and
lofty
hills
these
were
on
the
extreme
left
where
the
eye
could
embrace
a
prospect
that
extended
for
fifty
miles
while
on
the
right
the
eye
could
wander
for
many
a
mile
far
away
along
that
valley
which
lies
between
the
north
mountain
and
the
south
and
out
of
which
there
now
came
the
cornwallis
river
with
many
a
winding
to
receive
the
flood
tide
of
the
basin
of
minas
it
was
upon
this
scene
that
they
gazed
as
they
took
their
breakfast
and
while
the
emotions
of
each
were
different
all
felt
the
same
general
glow
that
was
naturally
produced
by
the
exhilaration
of
such
a
prospect
and
such
a
position
blomidon
could
not
be
seen
for
that
was
hidden
behind
a
projection
on
the
that
ran
down
towards
the
cape
and
thus
the
scene
was
deprived
of
that
grand
figure
which
from
every
other
point
is
so
attractive
yet
the
elevation
of
their
position
here
and
the
peculiar
way
in
which
the
plain
lay
spread
out
at
their
feet
and
the
vast
extent
of
country
which
was
embraced
by
the
eye
served
in
some
measure
to
make
amends
for
the
absence
of
the
majestic
cliff
and
there
beneath
them
the
waters
spread
afar
red
and
turbid
near
the
shore
but
farther
out
changing
to
deep
blue
while
towards
the
left
where
blomidon
lay
hid
guarding
the
strait
they
could
see
a
mass
of
fog
which
had
been
thrust
in
from
the
outside
bay
and
stood
there
a
gray
opaque
wall
towering
high
above
the
water
even
as
they
gazed
there
shot
out
from
that
gray
mass
of
fog
a
little
schooner
which
had
thus
leaped
in
a
moment
from
darkness
into
sunlight
and
like
a
bird
escaping
suddenly
from
some
gloomy
cage
seemed
to
spread
her
wings
joyously
and
move
exultantly
through
the
fresh
clear
air
what
a
glorious
prospect
exclaimed
porter
who
had
been
silently
enjoying
the
view
for
a
long
time
is
it
any
wonder
that
the
old
acadians
loved
this
country
of
theirs
so
passionately
and
made
such
desperate
struggles
to
get
back
after
they
had
been
driven
out
did
they
try
to
get
back
sir
asked
bart
i
should
think
they
did
and
many
succeeded
though
they
could
not
live
again
in
grand
pré
but
what
a
bitter
thing
it
was
to
be
torn
as
they
were
torn
from
such
a
home
as
this
and
scattered
at
random
over
all
the
coast
of
north
america
wasn
t
the
government
sorry
for
it
afterwards
asked
tom
o
no
it
was
one
of
the
cruelties
of
war
after
all
it
was
not
as
bad
as
the
sack
of
a
city
or
even
the
bombardment
of
one
all
these
things
are
alike
abominable
and
full
of
horror
the
government
considered
themselves
well
rid
of
people
who
were
a
trouble
to
them
that
s
but
i
don
t
see
why
they
couldn
t
have
let
them
it
s
a
sad
story
said
the
doctor
shaking
his
head
i
ll
tell
you
about
at
this
the
boys
all
gathered
around
him
some
of
them
knew
that
story
pretty
well
but
others
did
not
and
even
those
who
did
were
very
glad
of
the
chance
of
hearing
it
again
you
all
know
about
the
discovery
of
america
by
columbus
began
the
doctor
and
the
voyages
of
cabot
immediately
after
the
french
soon
rivalled
the
english
and
spanish
and
portuguese
cartier
and
champlain
sailed
over
all
these
seas
and
by
all
these
coasts
devoting
themselves
chiefly
to
what
is
now
british
america
it
is
certainly
a
strange
thing
that
the
part
of
america
which
was
originally
british
should
now
have
passed
away
from
british
rule
and
the
only
british
america
now
should
be
that
which
was
originally
french
many
years
passed
away
and
no
colonies
were
formed
at
last
at
nearly
the
same
time
the
french
and
english
both
began
the
french
however
were
first
they
came
over
and
in
founded
port
royal
now
annapolis
you
know
a
year
or
two
after
the
english
founded
jamestown
and
the
french
quebec
so
you
see
our
little
annapolis
is
the
oldest
place
on
the
continent
of
america
founded
by
europeans
with
perhaps
the
exception
of
augustine
in
florida
this
beginning
showed
how
things
would
go
the
english
took
the
atlantic
seaboard
from
massachusetts
to
the
carolinas
while
the
french
took
those
countries
that
are
now
british
provinces
at
first
but
little
progress
was
made
in
this
country
its
history
consists
chiefly
of
the
rivalry
of
two
leading
french
families
who
maintained
trading
stations
and
struggled
for
the
preeminence
out
here
and
for
support
from
the
french
government
still
the
settlements
grew
and
not
long
after
port
royal
was
founded
the
french
established
other
places
also
and
among
them
grand
pré
settlement
they
came
here
cleared
the
forest
diked
the
marshes
and
soon
became
a
prosperous
and
a
happy
community
so
things
went
on
meanwhile
the
french
and
english
were
engaged
in
continual
war
s
port
royal
was
captured
some
half
a
dozen
times
but
at
length
one
of
these
wars
was
concluded
by
the
peace
of
utrecht
in
by
which
this
province
was
ceded
to
the
english
at
the
time
of
the
cession
it
was
supposed
that
all
the
french
population
would
retire
the
english
allowed
them
a
year
to
sell
their
property
and
depart
with
the
permission
to
remain
however
if
they
would
take
the
oath
of
allegiance
but
none
were
willing
to
take
the
oath
as
to
going
away
that
soon
proved
to
be
a
difficult
matter
in
the
first
place
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
sell
their
farms
for
there
were
none
to
buy
them
in
the
second
place
it
was
impossible
to
get
away
for
there
were
no
ships
to
take
them
the
french
government
would
not
send
ships
for
they
hoped
in
the
course
of
time
to
get
back
the
country
and
preferred
that
this
french
population
should
remain
the
english
on
the
other
hand
wouldn
t
send
their
ships
first
because
they
thought
it
was
the
business
of
the
french
government
to
do
so
and
secondly
because
the
state
of
affairs
out
here
scarcely
excited
any
attention
whatever
in
the
home
government
meanwhile
the
english
held
the
country
after
a
fashion
they
didn
t
establish
any
towns
or
send
out
any
emigrants
but
merely
sent
a
governor
to
annapolis
as
they
now
called
port
royal
with
a
nominal
regiment
of
soldiers
these
soldiers
were
neglected
most
abominably
their
numbers
dwindled
down
to
a
small
company
they
were
ragged
and
without
sufficient
arms
and
ammunition
the
fort
went
to
ruin
one
governor
went
to
england
and
lived
there
drawing
his
pay
and
letting
the
soldiers
and
the
fort
get
along
the
best
way
they
could
at
length
one
of
the
governors
made
an
effort
to
do
something
the
french
instead
of
quitting
the
country
had
increased
in
numbers
to
an
alarming
extent
so
an
attempt
was
made
to
get
them
to
sign
an
oath
of
allegiance
to
the
king
of
england
this
they
refused
to
do
unless
a
proviso
were
inserted
in
the
oath
that
they
should
not
be
called
upon
to
bear
the
governor
after
some
demur
acceded
to
this
request
and
wrote
the
proviso
on
the
margin
of
the
document
which
was
then
signed
after
this
the
english
government
repudiated
this
as
utterly
unreasonable
and
other
governors
made
various
efforts
to
get
the
french
to
sign
an
unconditional
oath
but
only
with
partial
success
the
majority
of
them
claimed
that
indulgence
which
had
been
granted
by
the
proviso
and
in
accordance
with
this
they
determined
to
help
neither
party
not
even
their
own
countrymen
they
assumed
the
name
of
neutrals
by
which
they
were
known
to
both
parties
the
english
could
do
nothing
there
was
only
a
handful
of
soldiers
at
annapolis
and
though
they
were
afterwards
taken
better
care
of
yet
the
soldiers
and
the
fort
formed
but
a
weak
representation
of
the
power
of
britain
the
french
were
increasing
in
numbers
here
in
grand
pré
they
were
most
numerous
and
most
prosperous
they
were
peaceable
and
happy
and
industrious
and
contented
as
a
general
thing
they
maintained
most
faithfully
their
position
of
neutrality
french
agents
came
among
them
to
rouse
them
to
action
but
met
with
no
response
french
missionary
priests
acting
as
agents
for
the
french
governors
of
quebec
and
louisbourg
tried
to
stir
up
their
patriotic
ardor
but
without
much
success
an
expedition
came
from
louisbourg
against
annapolis
but
the
did
not
join
it
only
a
few
joined
the
invading
army
and
when
they
made
an
attack
on
annapolis
the
little
english
garrison
was
able
to
beat
them
off
no
fact
can
speak
more
plainly
than
this
in
favor
of
the
utter
peacefulness
of
their
dispositions
and
their
fixed
determination
to
keep
out
of
all
difficulties
that
neutrality
which
they
professed
they
maintained
as
perfectly
as
it
was
possible
for
any
community
so
things
went
on
until
the
year
when
the
english
government
took
the
affairs
of
the
province
of
nova
scotia
into
their
consideration
and
determined
to
colonize
it
on
a
large
scale
so
they
sent
out
a
fleet
with
thousands
of
emigrants
and
built
the
town
of
halifax
this
was
intended
to
be
a
counterpoise
to
quebec
and
also
an
assertion
of
their
power
in
the
province
of
nova
scotia
besides
this
place
which
they
made
the
capital
instead
of
annapolis
they
formed
other
settlements
but
they
soon
found
themselves
cramped
the
french
having
been
there
first
had
taken
possession
of
all
the
most
eligible
lands
the
places
to
which
emigrants
would
most
wish
to
go
were
already
filled
up
annapolis
and
grand
pré
and
other
places
were
occupied
and
the
english
who
wished
to
settle
had
to
go
to
places
which
were
far
inferior
besides
this
the
english
wanted
every
man
in
the
country
to
be
an
active
assistant
not
a
neutral
all
these
things
combined
to
make
the
question
of
the
acadians
a
very
troublesome
one
the
very
faithfulness
with
which
they
had
maintained
their
professions
of
neutrality
made
it
all
the
more
difficult
and
for
some
years
the
english
settlers
found
themselves
thus
shut
out
from
the
best
part
of
the
province
and
confined
to
those
portions
which
could
never
be
developed
to
any
extent
you
must
remember
that
it
was
not
the
province
of
nova
scotia
but
all
the
british
colonies
in
america
that
participated
in
this
question
all
along
the
atlantic
coast
the
provinces
watched
with
eager
interest
the
progress
of
the
english
settlement
here
hundreds
came
to
halifax
from
massachusetts
and
new
york
they
all
belonged
to
that
great
english
party
which
on
this
side
of
the
atlantic
was
carrying
on
a
war
with
the
french
it
was
a
question
between
the
french
and
english
races
which
should
rule
the
english
were
far
superior
as
colonizers
the
french
as
organizers
the
english
settlers
increased
and
multiplied
the
french
kept
up
formidable
forts
and
armies
and
enlisted
vast
numbers
of
indians
on
their
side
there
were
a
million
and
a
half
of
english
but
not
a
hundred
thousand
french
yet
the
french
kept
armies
on
foot
which
the
english
could
barely
equal
besides
the
french
had
a
grand
scheme
by
which
they
hoped
to
crush
the
growth
of
the
english
and
finally
subdue
them
they
held
all
the
valley
of
the
lawrence
and
the
valley
of
the
mississippi
they
had
settlements
on
both
rivers
and
their
great
scheme
was
to
build
a
line
of
forts
from
the
mississippi
to
the
lawrence
which
should
act
as
a
wall
to
hem
in
the
english
and
keep
them
within
that
narrow
line
of
territory
which
lies
along
the
atlantic
shore
all
this
alarmed
the
colonies
they
were
ready
to
fight
against
the
french
for
this
boundary
line
and
were
determined
from
the
very
outset
to
recognize
no
barrier
whatever
against
their
progress
westward
nominal
peace
might
be
between
france
and
england
at
home
but
out
here
there
was
never
peace
war
went
on
all
along
the
line
of
forts
and
the
french
with
their
indians
struggled
with
the
hardy
english
colonists
between
all
the
english
colonies
there
was
one
universal
sympathy
and
while
nova
scotia
watched
the
progress
of
her
more
southern
sisters
with
intense
interest
they
on
their
part
watched
the
progress
of
affairs
in
nova
scotia
with
interest
no
less
intense
all
were
alike
struggling
with
one
common
enemy
massachusetts
new
york
pennsylvania
virginia
all
were
watching
to
see
how
halifax
would
deal
with
the
acadians
or
with
louisbourg
while
nova
scotia
was
waiting
to
see
how
they
would
deal
with
the
ohio
forts
you
may
imagine
then
what
was
the
feeling
here
when
the
news
came
of
the
expedition
of
that
and
pragmatical
fool
general
of
his
disastrous
and
abominable
defeat
when
his
army
was
ruined
and
his
own
life
thrown
away
by
a
miserably
inferior
number
of
french
and
indians
a
panic
spread
everywhere
and
that
panic
which
ran
through
the
other
colonies
was
strong
in
nova
scotia
soon
after
an
opportunity
arose
to
deal
with
the
acadians
the
governor
was
a
determined
and
energetic
man
a
powerful
fleet
and
army
had
assembled
at
halifax
it
was
resolved
to
deal
summarily
with
the
acadians
but
how
that
was
the
question
it
would
not
do
to
march
an
army
against
them
and
expel
them
from
their
homes
they
would
merely
fly
to
the
woods
and
when
the
army
had
left
they
would
come
back
so
it
was
resolved
to
expel
them
from
their
homes
altogether
but
how
again
the
question
arose
if
they
merely
expelled
them
giving
them
the
liberty
of
flying
anywhere
they
would
all
go
to
cape
breton
to
swell
the
numbers
of
their
foes
if
they
conveyed
them
away
to
any
particular
place
they
might
be
formidable
from
their
numbers
and
find
means
of
coming
back
in
a
body
so
it
was
determined
to
carry
them
off
from
nova
scotia
and
scatter
them
as
widely
as
possible
over
all
the
colonies
along
the
atlantic
coast
by
way
of
a
beginning
they
resolved
to
give
the
acadians
one
last
chance
to
take
the
oath
of
allegiance
though
they
knew
that
the
offer
was
useless
so
they
sent
for
the
leading
men
of
the
settlements
and
brought
them
to
halifax
there
they
were
told
that
they
must
take
the
oath
or
submit
to
punishment
the
acadians
refused
and
pleaded
their
rights
as
neutrals
their
plea
was
rejected
and
they
were
imprisoned
after
this
the
measures
which
were
taken
were
swift
and
summary
before
the
acadians
could
know
what
had
happened
british
troops
appeared
at
each
of
the
settlements
at
grand
pré
they
summoned
all
the
inhabitants
to
a
place
of
meeting
the
acadians
came
without
suspicion
there
they
were
all
arrested
vessels
were
all
ready
to
receive
them
and
they
were
put
on
board
husbands
were
separated
from
their
wives
fathers
from
their
children
never
to
meet
again
they
were
all
packed
on
board
of
the
vessels
these
vessels
were
nearly
all
small
schooners
which
had
been
chartered
by
the
government
for
this
business
from
some
boston
merchants
last
year
when
i
was
at
halifax
i
saw
among
the
nova
scotia
archives
the
accounts
of
these
merchants
against
the
government
of
nova
scotia
for
the
expenses
of
carrying
off
the
acadians
i
took
a
copy
of
one
or
two
which
i
will
show
you
some
day
the
acadians
were
thus
in
a
moment
snatched
from
their
pleasant
homes
in
this
beautiful
country
and
separated
from
one
another
and
packed
in
small
schooners
and
carried
far
away
some
to
massachusetts
some
to
new
york
some
to
philadelphia
some
to
virginia
and
some
to
the
carolinas
what
the
acadians
of
grand
pré
suffered
all
suffered
they
were
carried
away
and
scattered
all
over
the
atlantic
coast
a
few
found
their
way
back
but
most
of
them
lived
and
died
in
exile
and
there
were
friends
divided
and
husbands
and
wives
severed
and
families
scattered
never
to
meet
again
on
earth
but
to
wear
out
their
lives
in
a
foreign
land
with
the
loss
of
all
that
was
most
dear
but
what
s
the
use
of
enlarging
on
this
if
you
want
to
know
more
about
it
go
and
read
longfellow
s
the
doctor
ceased
the
boys
were
silent
and
in
that
silence
the
thoughts
of
all
wandered
sadly
over
that
past
when
these
shores
and
these
waters
witnessed
the
mournful
expulsion
of
the
acadians
xiii
into
the
depths
of
the
primeval
over
rock
bush
and
a
toilsome
the
where
are
we
general
bewilderment
of
the
the
doctor
has
lost
his
emerging
suddenly
at
the
edge
of
a
giant
cliff
with
the
boom
of
the
surf
at
length
the
doctor
rose
and
the
boys
all
followed
him
to
the
carriages
getting
in
they
drove
a
short
distance
and
here
the
doctor
informed
them
that
he
was
going
to
leave
the
horses
and
carriages
we
ll
take
to
the
woods
now
said
he
and
you
must
prepare
for
a
good
long
steady
tramp
well
want
a
few
things
though
to
take
with
us
two
spades
will
be
enough
one
hammer
and
an
empty
basket
you
may
divide
these
among
yourselves
each
of
you
had
better
take
some
sandwiches
out
of
that
basket
and
anything
else
you
may
think
necessary
to
keep
you
up
on
your
the
boys
went
off
at
this
to
lay
in
a
stock
of
provisions
as
they
expected
to
be
on
the
move
all
day
each
one
took
enough
to
last
him
the
spades
they
divided
among
themselves
with
the
understanding
that
when
those
who
first
carried
them
grew
tired
they
should
be
relieved
by
the
others
the
horses
and
wagons
were
left
in
charge
of
the
people
of
the
house
with
whom
the
doctor
had
some
acquaintance
after
these
preliminaries
the
doctor
warned
the
boys
that
he
intended
to
plunge
boldly
into
the
woods
some
friends
of
his
had
formerly
gone
over
the
woods
to
the
right
which
extended
towards
cape
blomidon
but
had
found
nothing
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
if
the
fort
were
anywhere
it
would
be
found
among
the
woods
on
the
left
and
here
was
the
country
which
he
intended
to
explore
they
then
started
the
doctor
taking
the
lead
and
soon
turned
into
the
woods
they
entered
a
rough
pathway
which
had
been
formed
by
ox
teams
in
winter
while
hauling
out
lumber
and
cord
wood
it
was
now
about
nine
o
clock
after
a
time
the
pathway
divided
into
several
others
one
of
which
the
doctor
chose
and
went
on
but
soon
found
that
it
wound
away
in
a
direction
that
did
not
suit
him
he
walked
on
a
little
farther
and
then
coming
to
place
where
the
woods
were
less
dense
he
turned
aside
and
with
all
his
followers
at
his
back
plunged
into
the
primeval
forest
at
first
the
walking
was
not
difficult
the
trees
standing
far
apart
and
the
soil
beneath
being
covered
with
moss
and
long
ferns
but
after
a
time
the
woods
grew
denser
and
it
was
only
with
considerable
effort
that
they
were
able
to
move
along
every
step
seemed
to
make
it
worse
long
slender
trees
shot
up
not
large
enough
to
prevent
their
progress
but
sufficient
to
form
an
impediment
and
working
their
way
among
these
proved
very
difficult
and
very
fatiguing
what
was
worse
the
ground
began
to
grow
rougher
at
every
step
soon
they
emerged
from
the
thick
underbrush
and
came
to
where
the
trees
were
larger
and
farther
apart
from
one
another
but
here
the
ground
was
spongy
and
in
every
direction
lay
fallen
trunks
of
trees
some
prostrated
but
lately
others
lying
where
they
had
lain
for
years
in
every
stage
of
decay
these
they
had
to
clamber
over
or
crawl
under
and
so
it
was
that
in
order
to
make
any
progress
they
were
compelled
to
use
their
hands
as
well
as
their
feet
the
soil
beneath
was
hidden
under
a
covering
of
moss
but
it
was
swampy
and
spongy
and
the
soft
earth
was
interlaced
with
long
fibrous
roots
in
which
their
feet
caught
at
every
other
step
this
moss
overspread
everything
it
grew
over
the
fallen
trees
it
enfolded
in
its
green
mantle
the
huge
granite
bowlders
that
from
time
to
time
upreared
themselves
beneath
the
trees
at
length
they
came
to
a
slight
rise
in
the
ground
where
the
soil
was
dryer
here
the
doctor
paused
and
the
boys
all
flung
themselves
down
on
the
ground
breathing
heavily
they
had
walked
for
two
hours
now
without
stopping
and
began
to
feel
exhausted
the
doctor
also
showed
signs
of
exhaustion
he
said
nothing
however
but
scanned
very
narrowly
the
scene
around
him
he
found
but
little
before
his
eyes
that
was
in
any
way
different
from
what
he
had
been
looking
at
for
the
last
two
hours
he
could
see
a
few
paces
before
him
but
no
farther
there
the
trees
arose
and
the
prospect
terminated
in
the
dim
aisles
of
the
forest
with
their
shadowy
vistas
all
around
before
behind
and
on
either
side
it
was
the
same
there
was
the
dense
forest
just
such
a
forest
as
they
had
traversed
it
spread
all
around
them
the
only
place
where
a
view
could
be
had
for
any
distance
was
overhead
but
even
here
it
was
no
better
for
the
boys
as
they
flung
themselves
down
saw
that
during
their
journey
a
change
had
taken
place
overhead
the
blue
sky
was
no
longer
to
be
seen
in
its
place
there
came
close
down
a
dull
gray
indistinct
haze
which
descended
even
to
where
they
lay
hiding
the
tree
tops
from
view
it
was
the
fog
such
a
common
circumstance
elicited
no
surprise
of
course
it
was
no
more
than
might
have
been
expected
the
wind
had
changed
and
the
fog
of
the
bay
of
fundy
had
rushed
over
blomidon
and
they
in
those
dim
woods
were
now
enveloped
in
its
folds
nor
was
it
so
much
a
matter
of
regret
to
them
as
it
might
have
been
under
other
circumstances
here
in
the
woods
it
made
but
little
difference
in
their
situation
even
if
the
sun
were
shining
brightly
overhead
the
ground
beneath
would
be
just
as
swampy
the
fallen
trees
as
troublesome
the
underbrush
as
thick
whatever
were
the
doctors
own
private
feelings
he
kept
them
to
himself
and
surveyed
the
scene
in
silence
at
length
he
made
up
his
mind
as
to
his
course
and
once
more
started
for
his
onward
journey
the
journey
was
the
same
as
before
sometimes
a
great
growth
of
underbrush
would
impede
their
progress
and
that
underbrush
would
vary
from
the
tall
slender
stems
of
the
young
maples
to
the
dense
and
prickly
spines
of
the
young
spruces
at
other
times
the
trees
would
stand
apart
the
scene
would
expand
and
they
would
be
encircled
by
a
dense
array
of
forest
columns
between
which
the
view
was
lost
in
shadow
and
gloom
sometimes
they
plunged
into
swamps
unawares
at
other
times
they
tore
their
way
through
ferns
and
trailing
plants
again
they
were
compelled
to
climb
over
fallen
trees
or
crawl
under
them
once
they
came
to
a
place
which
was
quite
bare
of
trees
but
overgrown
with
fire
weed
and
blueberries
such
places
as
these
were
known
to
them
by
the
name
of
barrens
and
on
this
occasion
they
made
use
of
it
to
take
a
long
rest
the
doctor
again
looked
all
around
him
thoughtfully
and
appeared
buried
in
profound
reflection
it
was
here
that
a
thought
flashed
to
the
minds
of
all
the
boys
it
was
this
the
doctor
hadn
t
the
least
idea
where
he
was
the
moment
that
thought
arose
every
act
of
the
doctor
s
confirmed
it
his
silence
was
a
very
remarkable
thing
usually
he
was
genial
and
lively
and
such
was
his
flow
of
spirits
that
he
could
always
throw
an
air
of
joyousness
around
an
occasion
like
this
usually
he
was
full
of
pleasant
and
encouraging
words
he
had
by
nature
a
rare
aptitude
for
winning
the
affection
and
confidence
of
boys
by
throwing
himself
into
their
feelings
with
all
his
attainments
he
had
in
him
much
of
that
fresh
brave
frank
joyous
hilarious
temper
which
we
call
boyish
and
his
own
free
and
frank
nature
his
generous
enthusiasm
his
disdain
for
all
that
was
base
his
exultation
in
all
that
was
noble
and
pure
all
combined
to
win
the
reverential
affection
of
his
boys
as
he
called
them
but
now
he
had
been
silent
for
hours
during
all
that
weary
march
he
had
spoken
no
word
of
encouragement
his
pleasant
cheery
voice
which
might
have
lightened
half
their
toil
had
not
been
heard
his
face
was
anxious
his
gaze
abstracted
what
in
the
world
could
be
the
cause
of
this
this
was
the
question
that
came
to
all
and
all
felt
that
one
thing
and
one
thing
only
could
in
any
way
account
for
this
the
doctor
had
lost
his
way
such
was
the
general
conclusion
but
what
was
to
be
done
none
of
them
could
direct
him
aright
all
were
alike
in
the
dark
as
to
their
possible
position
the
sky
was
not
visible
there
were
no
landmarks
by
which
to
be
guided
even
the
sight
of
the
sun
would
have
been
a
guide
but
the
sun
was
now
shut
out
from
their
view
by
a
dense
veil
of
fog
the
doctor
remained
for
a
long
time
lost
in
his
own
thoughts
and
this
time
of
rest
was
precious
to
the
overworn
boys
they
talked
in
low
tones
with
one
another
as
to
where
they
might
be
none
could
throw
any
light
on
this
question
every
one
had
a
different
opinion
none
could
even
suggest
any
reliable
way
of
finding
out
what
they
wished
to
know
but
at
any
rate
the
time
of
rest
was
precious
to
them
all
and
when
at
length
the
doctor
called
to
them
to
start
once
more
they
followed
him
with
new
vigor
in
their
limbs
the
doctor
now
crossed
the
barrens
and
changed
his
direction
somewhat
to
the
right
they
entered
the
woods
again
and
once
more
encountered
the
old
struggle
against
swamps
and
ferns
and
underbrush
and
tangled
roots
and
fallen
trees
the
journey
this
time
seemed
harder
than
before
the
boys
began
to
feel
their
exhaustion
more
keenly
they
exchanged
words
of
despondency
and
declared
to
one
another
that
they
could
not
hold
out
much
longer
their
progress
was
much
slower
than
it
had
formerly
been
for
the
doctor
himself
began
to
feel
the
effects
of
such
unusual
and
such
excessive
exertion
he
led
them
forward
therefore
quite
slowly
and
stopped
to
rest
at
times
what
made
it
worse
for
the
boys
was
the
fact
that
all
this
time
they
had
to
carry
the
shovels
and
other
things
there
were
four
of
these
two
spades
one
hammer
and
one
basket
these
the
boys
carried
by
turns
but
the
trouble
of
carrying
them
under
such
circumstances
was
intolerable
sometimes
they
proposed
to
one
another
to
drop
them
but
this
proposal
was
not
carried
out
they
still
bore
them
on
and
exchanged
their
burdens
more
rapidly
as
they
grew
more
weary
at
last
the
woods
grew
thinner
the
ground
dryer
and
the
trees
smaller
the
walking
was
much
easier
the
necessity
of
such
very
violent
exertion
was
taken
off
this
ground
formed
a
gentle
declivity
where
the
woods
in
front
though
much
thinner
than
those
behind
still
shut
out
the
view
gradually
these
woods
grew
less
and
less
dense
until
at
last
immediately
in
front
they
could
look
through
and
see
beyond
the
signs
of
some
opening
and
now
the
ground
began
to
descend
more
steeply
where
they
were
going
none
could
tell
some
thought
that
they
were
approaching
a
clearing
for
every
step
made
the
opening
in
front
more
and
more
plain
through
the
trees
there
was
nothing
visible
indeed
but
the
gray
foggy
atmosphere
yet
this
itself
showed
them
that
they
were
about
to
emerge
from
the
woods
where
or
in
what
part
of
the
country
they
could
not
imagine
some
of
them
thought
that
they
were
approaching
a
settlement
and
rejoiced
in
the
prospect
of
getting
upon
a
road
or
finding
a
house
where
they
might
rest
others
thought
that
they
were
descending
the
slope
of
the
mountain
towards
cornwallis
and
were
hoping
every
moment
to
emerge
forth
from
the
woods
into
some
green
meadow
or
pleasant
pasture
whatever
hope
they
might
have
had
its
effect
on
all
of
them
was
the
same
they
forgot
their
fatigue
new
strength
came
to
their
wearied
limbs
the
doctor
advanced
faster
and
the
boys
in
their
eagerness
even
hurried
ahead
of
him
bruce
and
bart
were
first
among
the
hurrying
throng
and
now
the
ground
descended
still
more
steeply
and
in
front
the
gray
mist
spread
out
more
widely
but
one
or
two
trees
yet
intervened
forward
rushed
bart
and
bruce
after
them
hurried
all
the
others
but
what
was
this
suddenly
they
all
stopped
and
sprang
back
a
pace
or
two
for
they
had
reached
almost
the
outside
edge
of
the
forest
but
only
to
find
that
the
gray
mist
before
them
was
floating
free
in
the
sky
and
that
the
skirt
of
the
forest
was
the
edge
of
a
tremendous
precipice
which
went
sheer
down
below
them
to
a
place
where
the
wild
sea
waves
hidden
from
them
by
the
mist
sent
up
a
long
low
distant
booming
sound
as
they
broke
in
thunder
on
the
shore
xiv
precipices
mists
and
ocean
the
party
divided
and
each
half
departs
to
seek
its
separate
pat
shows
how
to
go
in
a
straight
pat
and
the
in
chase
after
disappearance
of
a
lost
wanderings
in
search
of
the
they
stood
for
a
while
confounded
before
them
nothing
could
be
seen
but
the
impenetrable
fog
the
water
beneath
was
not
visible
but
the
surf
sent
up
its
boom
and
they
knew
that
they
were
somewhere
on
the
shore
of
the
bay
of
fundy
but
where
this
is
certainly
a
most
extraordinary
thing
cried
the
doctor
at
last
the
others
said
nothing
but
by
their
silence
assented
to
the
truth
of
this
undeniable
statement
one
thing
is
said
the
doctor
again
and
that
is
that
this
is
not
the
old
french
fort
in
fact
i
begin
to
doubt
whether
there
is
any
old
french
fort
here
at
all
they
surely
would
never
have
been
mad
enough
to
build
any
kind
of
a
fort
in
these
abominable
to
this
again
the
boys
made
no
reply
the
assertion
seemed
so
that
it
appeared
like
the
utterance
of
actual
fact
it
is
a
conviction
resumed
the
doctor
that
has
been
growing
stronger
and
stronger
ever
since
we
left
the
barrens
and
i
now
accept
it
without
reserve
but
at
the
same
time
boys
i
confess
that
i
haven
t
the
smallest
idea
where
we
we
must
be
somewhere
on
the
coast
between
scott
s
bay
and
hall
s
harbor
said
bruce
perfectly
true
said
the
doctor
but
where
on
that
coast
as
some
ten
or
fifteen
miles
lie
between
those
two
places
we
have
an
almost
unlimited
latitude
for
nothing
was
said
for
some
time
all
looked
along
the
coast
line
in
both
directions
to
see
if
anything
were
visible
nothing
however
could
be
seen
the
dense
fog
concealed
everything
from
view
well
said
the
doctor
we
shall
have
to
do
something
that
s
evident
now
you
re
all
very
tired
and
so
am
i
let
us
sit
here
and
rest
and
debate
which
way
we
had
better
they
all
sat
down
on
the
slope
and
looking
at
their
watches
they
found
that
it
was
half
past
two
o
clock
we
haven
t
much
time
to
lose
that
s
plain
said
the
doctor
as
he
looked
at
his
watch
let
us
try
first
of
all
to
find
out
where
we
are
in
the
first
place
i
think
all
things
considered
that
we
came
in
a
pretty
straight
line
i
tried
to
guide
myself
by
the
as
i
went
and
i
think
our
course
was
as
straight
as
the
boys
all
thought
so
too
yes
said
the
doctor
i
m
quite
positive
about
that
it
was
in
my
mind
all
the
time
to
keep
a
perfectly
straight
course
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
that
our
way
would
have
been
easier
but
i
had
decided
on
the
position
of
the
old
french
fort
and
had
marked
it
on
my
map
so
on
starting
i
took
my
bearings
and
kept
on
by
the
trees
keeping
as
straight
a
course
as
possible
you
observed
how
attentive
i
was
to
that
that
was
the
reason
why
i
had
so
few
words
of
encouragement
for
my
patient
young
friends
who
were
toiling
after
me
and
for
whom
i
felt
exceedingly
sorry
all
the
o
doctor
said
bart
we
re
all
right
we
only
hope
that
you
will
stand
well
let
us
keep
up
our
spirits
said
the
doctor
cheerily
and
we
ll
come
out
all
right
yet
so
you
see
we
may
consider
that
our
course
has
been
a
fair
one
and
now
i
will
make
a
rough
map
of
our
saying
this
the
doctor
took
his
and
drew
his
rough
he
marked
a
rough
outline
for
the
coast
between
scott
s
bay
and
hall
s
harbor
then
he
drew
the
roads
which
ran
from
each
of
these
places
across
the
north
mountain
to
cornwallis
and
finally
he
traced
a
straight
line
from
the
place
where
they
had
started
in
the
direction
which
he
supposed
that
they
had
gone
the
result
was
that
he
made
their
present
position
close
by
hall
s
harbor
after
finishing
this
he
handed
it
to
the
boys
who
inspected
it
very
closely
well
said
the
doctor
what
do
you
think
of
it
they
were
silent
for
some
time
at
length
bruce
spoke
the
only
thing
against
it
sir
said
he
is
that
our
course
may
not
have
been
so
perfectly
but
then
said
the
doctor
i
took
particular
care
and
always
kept
several
trees
in
line
before
me
so
as
to
go
still
sir
said
bruce
travelling
in
the
woods
is
a
very
peculiar
thing
i
ve
done
it
often
i
ve
lived
for
weeks
in
the
woods
camping
out
and
it
s
always
been
my
experience
that
a
man
can
t
go
straight
unless
he
has
a
compass
or
at
least
some
general
landmarks
an
indian
might
perhaps
but
i
m
sure
i
couldn
the
doctor
seemed
quite
impressed
by
this
well
bruce
said
he
i
know
you
have
had
far
more
experience
in
the
woods
than
i
can
pretend
to
and
i
should
like
very
much
to
get
your
opinion
without
you
see
sir
said
bruce
everybody
has
a
tendency
in
the
woods
to
lean
to
the
right
it
s
the
same
i
ve
heard
on
the
western
prairies
i
don
t
pretend
to
know
the
cause
of
it
i
only
know
it
s
so
this
makes
one
go
in
a
kind
of
curved
line
so
that
if
one
wanders
long
enough
he
ll
perform
a
sort
of
circle
i
know
once
in
cape
breton
i
actually
came
back
to
the
place
i
started
from
and
all
the
time
i
thought
i
was
miles
away
i
took
great
pains
too
to
walk
straight
and
it
was
a
better
country
than
this
now
we
ve
been
working
our
way
through
all
kinds
of
places
we
ve
been
in
thick
underbrush
where
for
my
part
i
don
t
see
how
it
was
possible
to
keep
a
straight
course
we
ve
had
to
go
round
rocks
and
fallen
trees
after
breaking
a
straight
course
by
making
such
a
circuit
however
small
it
seems
to
me
almost
impossible
to
take
it
up
again
a
slight
mistake
at
the
outset
makes
a
great
difference
by
the
time
you
get
to
the
journey
s
well
said
the
doctor
where
do
you
think
we
may
be
point
out
on
the
map
the
i
can
t
do
that
said
bruce
of
course
i
can
only
say
that
i
think
we
ve
been
as
usual
swerving
to
the
right
and
if
so
we
are
now
really
much
nearer
to
scott
s
bay
than
we
are
to
hall
s
the
doctor
now
sat
thinking
for
some
time
there
s
a
great
deal
in
what
you
say
bruce
said
he
at
length
and
i
m
very
glad
you
ve
given
your
opinion
at
the
same
time
i
feel
quite
confident
that
if
i
have
swerved
to
the
right
it
can
not
have
been
to
any
great
extent
the
care
which
i
took
was
so
extreme
that
my
calculations
can
not
be
much
out
of
the
way
i
dare
say
i
may
have
lost
my
course
a
little
while
going
through
the
thick
underbrush
but
i
m
convinced
that
i
found
it
again
pretty
correctly
now
i
will
mark
out
a
new
track
on
the
map
and
make
allowance
for
any
deviation
from
a
true
saying
this
the
doctor
traced
a
new
line
which
curved
slightly
to
the
right
and
made
their
present
position
somewhat
farther
away
from
hall
s
harbor
than
the
former
conjecture
had
made
it
still
this
new
estimate
made
them
much
nearer
to
hall
s
harbor
than
to
scott
s
bay
he
showed
this
to
bruce
and
asked
him
what
he
thought
of
it
well
sir
said
bruce
i
will
only
say
that
if
i
had
headed
the
party
with
all
my
care
i
should
be
very
much
farther
to
the
right
than
you
make
so
you
think
that
we
are
now
nearer
to
scott
s
bay
than
to
hall
s
harbor
very
much
nearer
sir
said
bruce
the
doctor
said
no
more
but
sat
for
a
long
time
silently
regarding
his
map
well
said
he
at
last
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
fair
question
you
bruce
have
had
very
much
experience
in
the
woods
but
then
i
rely
on
my
own
correctness
on
the
whole
i
think
it
would
be
better
for
us
now
to
divide
ourselves
into
two
parties
one
party
could
go
in
the
direction
of
hall
s
harbor
the
other
towards
scott
s
bay
as
you
are
an
old
hand
in
the
woods
bruce
i
consider
you
quite
fit
to
head
one
party
and
try
scott
s
bay
for
my
part
i
will
take
another
party
and
make
for
hall
s
harbor
what
do
you
say
to
that
o
no
sir
said
bruce
we
won
t
leave
you
we
ll
stay
with
you
and
follow
you
wherever
you
the
doctor
laughed
o
nonsense
said
he
if
we
were
wandering
in
the
forests
of
the
amazon
valley
we
might
then
make
it
a
matter
of
duty
to
stand
by
one
another
but
these
woods
are
only
a
small
affair
by
going
in
any
direction
we
must
emerge
from
them
before
very
long
even
if
we
were
overtaken
by
the
darkness
it
would
be
no
great
hardship
to
pass
the
night
here
we
could
make
comfortable
beds
out
of
spruce
boughs
and
fern
to
tell
the
truth
roughing
it
in
the
bush
has
rather
an
attraction
for
me
than
otherwise
and
i
know
your
weakness
boys
in
that
respect
besides
in
two
hours
at
the
very
farthest
we
re
sure
to
come
out
somewhere
if
i
thought
that
there
was
any
danger
i
would
not
think
of
separating
you
but
would
guard
you
as
carefully
as
possible
the
most
that
can
happen
is
some
little
inconvenience
so
bruce
you
may
consider
yourself
the
commander
of
the
scott
s
bay
party
who
will
be
your
followers
i
said
bart
whose
hesitation
had
been
driven
away
by
the
doctor
s
words
i
said
arthur
and
i
said
tom
and
i
said
phil
bedad
thin
an
it
s
mesilf
that
ll
jine
that
same
said
pat
who
preferred
the
comparative
freedom
that
he
would
enjoy
under
bruce
to
the
restraint
which
he
felt
with
the
doctor
for
the
doctor
who
with
the
other
boys
was
a
great
favorite
and
had
won
all
their
hearts
by
that
boyish
enthusiasm
which
age
could
never
extinguish
in
him
and
by
his
evident
and
sympathy
with
them
in
all
their
joys
and
sorrows
was
not
so
well
known
to
pat
and
in
spite
of
his
kindness
to
the
poor
irish
boy
still
remained
an
object
of
grateful
affection
certainly
but
yet
one
of
extreme
awe
so
pat
elected
to
go
with
bruce
the
other
boys
preferred
taking
their
chance
with
the
doctor
these
were
jiggins
bogud
sammy
johnny
and
billymack
thus
the
party
was
about
equally
divided
five
going
under
the
command
of
bruce
and
five
under
the
command
of
the
doctor
by
the
time
these
arrangements
were
completed
it
was
three
o
clock
they
all
felt
refreshed
by
their
rest
and
inspirited
also
by
the
prospect
of
getting
onward
out
of
the
woods
into
some
road
or
some
settlement
if
i
reach
hall
s
harbor
said
the
doctor
i
will
get
horses
and
drive
at
once
to
where
we
left
our
wagons
if
you
get
to
the
scott
s
bay
road
go
back
to
that
place
and
wait
for
with
these
words
the
doctor
and
his
party
set
off
in
one
direction
while
bruce
started
away
with
his
followers
in
another
as
the
trees
were
farther
apart
near
the
edge
of
the
cliff
he
walked
along
here
for
some
time
but
at
last
finding
that
the
line
was
irregular
and
coming
to
a
place
where
it
ran
out
into
a
kind
of
promontory
he
kept
on
seeking
only
to
find
the
easiest
place
for
walking
for
a
long
time
he
tried
to
keep
in
a
line
with
what
he
supposed
to
be
the
direction
of
the
coast
but
at
length
he
found
himself
away
from
it
altogether
he
then
turned
determined
to
regain
it
but
found
the
way
so
difficult
that
he
gave
it
up
the
fact
is
boys
said
he
our
only
chance
was
to
keep
stolidly
along
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
follow
all
its
windings
we
ve
lost
it
now
there
are
two
things
for
us
to
do
either
to
get
back
to
the
cliff
again
at
all
hazards
or
to
keep
on
through
the
woods
as
we
are
going
now
one
is
the
safer
way
but
the
other
is
o
bother
the
cliff
said
bart
we
re
doing
very
well
i
don
t
care
for
my
part
whether
we
re
lost
or
not
i
d
just
as
soon
camp
out
the
only
trouble
is
we
haven
t
anything
to
eat
we
ve
eaten
all
our
sandwiches
and
then
these
miserable
spades
i
don
t
see
why
they
couldn
t
have
taken
them
but
no
jiggins
and
bogud
insisted
on
taking
the
hammer
and
the
basket
and
they
call
that
a
fair
division
i
m
of
bart
s
opinion
said
arthur
i
say
let
s
go
where
it
is
easiest
and
trust
to
luck
and
let
s
all
take
care
of
our
right
legs
and
not
let
them
drag
us
into
a
no
that
won
t
do
said
bruce
if
you
try
to
guard
against
turning
to
the
right
you
ll
be
sure
to
turn
too
much
to
the
left
it
s
impossible
to
go
straight
unless
you
re
an
indian
best
to
walk
as
straight
as
you
can
and
occasionally
change
your
course
so
as
to
correct
any
why
not
walk
zigzag
said
phil
or
backwards
said
tom
i
ll
tell
you
said
pat
what
we
d
ort
till
do
let
s
howld
a
sthraight
powl
before
ourselves
an
follow
it
that
ll
be
sure
till
take
us
a
roar
of
laughter
greeted
this
proposal
very
well
pat
get
your
pole
and
try
it
said
bart
deed
an
i
jist
will
said
pat
and
seeing
a
young
slender
maple
near
by
he
cut
it
down
with
his
knife
lopped
off
the
young
twigs
and
thus
formed
a
long
slender
straight
pole
taking
this
in
his
hand
he
gravely
put
himself
at
the
head
of
the
party
then
he
held
out
the
pole
there
said
he
isn
t
this
powl
sthraight
of
course
it
is
said
they
then
sure
an
if
we
go
by
it
we
must
go
sthraight
too
said
pat
and
saying
this
he
started
off
holding
the
pole
before
him
the
boys
followed
in
great
glee
almost
bursting
with
laughter
while
pat
led
them
on
with
his
pole
with
an
expression
of
ineffable
satisfaction
holding
the
pole
straight
before
him
so
they
went
on
and
bruce
out
of
pure
enjoyment
of
the
thing
let
pat
lead
wherever
he
wished
at
last
pat
gave
a
wild
yell
leaped
forward
and
slashed
violently
with
his
pole
at
something
the
hoys
crowded
up
the
something
at
which
pat
had
struck
had
got
under
some
fern
leaves
and
was
not
visible
but
pat
slashed
away
bravely
in
all
directions
suddenly
there
came
running
out
a
queer
little
animal
all
covered
with
sharp
spines
it
did
not
run
very
fast
and
bart
who
carried
a
spade
could
easily
have
killed
it
but
he
did
not
he
stood
still
and
let
it
run
close
by
him
pat
had
lost
sight
of
it
for
a
moment
and
was
looking
in
all
directions
for
it
when
suddenly
he
caught
sight
of
it
with
a
wild
yell
he
rushed
after
it
swinging
his
pole
and
slashing
it
madly
against
the
ground
the
little
animal
dodged
under
some
blueberry
bushes
and
while
pat
was
slashing
at
these
it
escaped
and
ran
into
a
hollow
tree
which
lay
on
the
ground
into
this
pat
poked
his
pole
but
as
he
poked
it
in
at
one
end
the
little
animal
ran
out
from
the
other
and
hurried
away
as
fast
as
his
little
legs
would
carry
him
again
pat
caught
sight
of
him
and
gave
chase
meanwhile
the
other
boys
had
not
interfered
they
left
it
all
to
pat
they
also
felt
a
sort
of
sympathy
with
the
poor
little
creature
and
gave
it
all
their
best
wishes
in
its
efforts
to
escape
phil
as
well
as
bart
might
have
despatched
it
with
the
spade
that
he
happened
just
then
to
be
carrying
but
he
would
not
so
the
little
thing
ran
off
and
pat
followed
after
it
turning
and
winding
in
all
directions
the
boys
then
went
off
after
pat
so
as
to
keep
him
in
sight
but
before
long
they
lost
him
altogether
they
went
forward
to
the
last
place
where
they
had
seen
him
and
began
to
shout
for
him
there
was
no
answer
however
they
shouted
again
and
again
and
waited
a
long
time
for
some
response
they
began
to
be
anxious
about
him
where
had
he
gone
he
was
chasing
that
little
animal
and
in
the
excitement
of
the
chase
had
forgotten
everything
it
was
getting
late
and
there
was
no
time
now
for
chasing
anything
they
ought
to
be
moving
on
and
trying
to
get
to
scott
s
bay
but
they
could
not
do
so
till
they
had
found
pat
they
wandered
along
calling
in
every
possible
kind
of
way
and
waiting
after
every
call
to
see
if
there
would
be
any
response
but
no
response
came
they
kept
on
in
the
way
in
which
they
supposed
pat
had
gone
and
shouted
and
screamed
and
halloed
and
yelled
and
whistled
and
made
every
noise
that
could
be
made
but
their
utmost
efforts
proved
of
no
avail
and
all
their
shouts
excited
no
response
except
the
echoes
that
reverberated
through
the
long
dim
forest
aisles
at
length
they
gave
up
well
what
are
we
to
do
now
said
bruce
pat
s
off
that
s
certain
said
bart
and
how
we
can
find
him
again
is
more
than
i
can
there
isn
t
any
danger
of
course
he
ll
work
his
way
along
but
still
he
belongs
to
our
party
and
i
don
t
like
the
idea
of
leaving
we
d
better
keep
on
quietly
as
we
were
going
said
arthur
there
s
no
use
for
us
to
stand
still
this
seems
to
be
the
direction
in
which
he
was
yes
said
tom
let
s
go
on
we
haven
t
any
time
to
lose
it
s
six
o
clock
they
went
on
they
hadn
t
the
faintest
idea
now
where
they
were
whatever
general
notion
of
their
course
they
had
kept
up
while
first
following
pat
had
now
been
altogether
lost
his
chase
after
the
little
animal
had
been
a
very
eccentric
one
and
they
had
faced
in
several
different
directions
while
pursuing
him
the
monotonous
woods
gave
no
sign
by
which
they
might
learn
their
course
they
could
not
find
their
way
now
even
to
the
place
where
pat
had
been
seized
with
his
strange
frenzy
the
fact
is
they
were
utterly
and
hopelessly
lost
it
seems
to
me
said
arthur
that
we
re
going
to
hall
s
no
said
phil
we
re
steering
straight
for
not
a
bit
of
it
said
tom
we
re
going
to
scott
s
it
s
my
opinion
said
bart
that
we
re
on
our
way
to
the
cliff
and
as
its
getting
dark
we
d
better
be
careful
bruce
if
you
get
to
the
cliff
first
and
fall
over
in
the
dark
just
let
us
know
before
you
go
down
i
wouldn
t
care
so
much
in
fine
bright
weather
but
i
have
a
prejudice
against
tumbling
over
cliffs
on
a
foggy
you
needn
t
trouble
yourself
said
bruce
we
ll
never
come
near
a
cliff
or
anything
else
i
know
all
about
it
we
re
wandering
in
a
circle
we
ll
camp
in
the
woods
and
night
after
wandering
all
day
we
ll
get
back
to
the
same
place
i
move
therefore
that
we
stop
now
in
this
place
and
build
a
good
solid
camp
that
will
serve
for
a
shelter
every
night
after
our
circular
well
said
bart
we
won
t
begin
just
yet
i
want
to
get
to
the
i
want
to
get
to
scott
s
bay
said
tom
i
m
determined
said
phil
to
get
to
pooh
said
arthur
every
one
of
us
will
sleep
in
hall
s
harbor
come
along
xv
lost
the
gathering
gloom
of
fog
and
of
night

the
lost

of
when
will

once
more
upon
the
they
went
on
the
shades
of
evening
were
now
coming
down
rapidly
and
these
were
all
intensified
by
the
dense
fog
that
hung
around
them
the
woods
grew
more
and
more
obscure
and
the
gloom
that
prevailed
here
was
added
to
that
of
the
twilight
and
the
fog
it
was
evident
that
they
could
not
go
on
much
longer
fortunately
it
was
not
so
difficult
now
as
it
had
been
previously
the
trees
stood
farther
apart
than
usual
there
was
but
little
underbrush
the
ground
was
covered
with
moss
but
it
was
quite
dry
this
was
encouraging
for
if
they
tried
to
pass
the
night
in
the
woods
they
could
not
find
a
better
place
than
the
one
which
they
were
traversing
they
would
probably
have
given
up
and
decided
upon
making
preparations
for
the
night
had
it
not
been
for
their
desire
to
find
pat
if
he
had
been
with
them
their
journey
for
that
night
would
have
ended
but
they
did
not
like
to
think
of
him
alone
severed
from
them
and
wandering
in
the
woods
so
they
kept
on
their
way
and
still
as
they
went
along
they
shouted
occasionally
with
some
vague
hope
that
their
cry
might
come
to
the
ears
of
the
wanderer
it
grew
darker
and
darker
at
last
they
began
to
think
of
halting
for
the
night
pat
was
given
up
they
comforted
themselves
with
the
thought
that
he
was
hardy
and
fearless
and
that
the
nights
were
mild
and
that
spruce
boughs
abounded
together
with
ferns
and
moss
on
which
one
might
sleep
peacefully
and
pleasantly
so
as
it
grew
darker
they
talked
of
stopping
and
making
their
preparations
for
the
night
before
it
grew
too
dark
suddenly
as
they
were
talking
over
these
things
they
saw
before
them
through
the
trees
yet
not
more
than
a
dozen
paces
distant
a
very
familiar
form
it
was
a
snake
fence
that
is
to
say
a
fence
formed
of
poles
built
in
such
a
way
that
it
runs
in
a
zigzag
direction
at
once
the
thought
flashed
upon
them
that
they
were
near
some
farmhouse
perhaps
some
settlement
and
then
arose
the
hope
of
a
better
night
s
rest
than
could
be
afforded
by
the
woods
with
their
damp
and
foggy
atmosphere
with
a
cry
of
joy
they
rushed
forward
they
reached
it
they
looked
over
in
a
moment
the
cry
of
joy
was
succeeded
by
one
of
surprise
it
was
a
road
which
lay
before
them
yes
a
road
wide
and
well
travelled
not
a
private
path
to
some
small
cottage
not
an
through
dense
woods
but
a
regular
road
fit
for
carriages
and
evidently
leading
to
some
settlement
but
what
settlement
in
a
moment
they
had
clambered
over
the
fence
and
stood
in
the
road
with
one
common
determination
in
all
of
them
not
to
leave
it
again
for
any
woods
whatsoever
yet
what
road
was
this
and
where
did
it
go
this
was
the
question
and
this
question
it
was
not
possible
to
answer
had
they
continued
on
uninterruptedly
bruce
would
have
been
convinced
that
it
was
the
scott
s
bay
road
but
their
digression
after
pat
had
led
them
such
a
journey
that
he
was
not
by
any
means
sure
nor
were
any
of
the
others
all
felt
that
they
had
been
wandering
blindly
that
after
leaving
the
cliff
they
had
no
certainty
as
to
their
destination
this
uncertainty
had
been
increased
by
pat
s
leadership
with
the
pole
and
had
been
turned
into
utter
and
hopeless
perplexity
by
their
last
pursuit
of
him
they
had
been
wandering
now
since
they
parted
with
porter
for
more
than
four
hours
that
gave
time
enough
for
them
to
get
anywhere
it
might
be
the
road
to
hall
s
harbor
in
which
they
now
found
themselves
in
this
state
of
uncertainty
they
remained
for
some
time
well
boys
said
bruce
at
last
it
s
impossible
to
tell
where
we
are
but
in
my
opinion
we
d
better
take
it
for
granted
that
this
is
the
scott
s
bay
road
it
s
more
likely
after
all
to
be
that
than
the
hall
s
harbor
road
if
it
is
we
have
to
find
our
way
back
to
where
the
wagons
are
according
to
the
doctor
s
directions
and
wait
there
for
him
now
if
this
is
the
scott
s
bay
road
we
must
turn
to
the
right
in
order
to
go
back
for
on
the
left
it
goes
to
scott
s
bay
so
i
say
let
s
turn
up
the
road
to
the
right
and
walk
back
to
the
bruce
s
opinion
was
accepted
by
the
others
and
his
decision
at
once
adopted
they
all
turned
up
the
road
to
the
right
and
walked
onward
not
knowing
how
far
they
would
have
to
walk
yet
feeling
greatly
inspirited
by
the
mere
fact
that
they
were
out
of
the
woods
as
they
went
on
it
grew
darker
and
darker
at
every
step
the
sun
had
gone
down
the
shadows
of
night
were
descending
and
these
shadows
were
all
deepened
by
the
universal
fog
which
covered
all
things
the
deepening
gloom
made
their
own
escape
from
the
woods
appear
all
the
more
fortunate
true
they
might
have
built
a
fire
there
to
cheer
themselves
by
its
light
and
spread
soft
beds
of
moss
and
fern
around
it
and
thus
even
amid
the
forest
they
could
have
risen
superior
to
their
dismal
surroundings
but
still
there
was
a
very
great
relief
which
was
felt
by
all
at
their
gaining
a
road
which
might
lead
them
to
some
human
abode
besides
they
were
hungry
they
had
eaten
all
their
sandwiches
and
were
eager
for
something
to
assuage
their
ravenous
appetites
one
thing
there
was
however
which
greatly
marred
their
joy
and
that
was
the
thought
of
poor
pat
perhaps
he
still
was
wandering
in
the
woods
having
given
up
his
chase
calling
for
them
and
thinking
that
they
had
deserted
him
the
thought
of
poor
pat
s
loneliness
was
a
sad
one
to
all
of
them
and
they
could
only
find
consolation
in
their
belief
in
his
perfect
ability
to
take
care
of
himself
at
books
he
might
not
be
very
brilliant
but
in
all
the
practical
matters
of
life
pat
was
certainly
in
every
way
worthy
of
being
left
entirely
to
himself
under
such
circumstances
pat
was
able
to
shine
with
uncommon
brilliancy
in
all
probability
he
would
fare
better
if
left
to
his
own
devices
than
he
would
if
he
were
a
member
of
a
crowd
of
with
such
thoughts
as
these
they
comforted
themselves
and
thus
tried
to
overcome
their
anxiety
about
pat
they
had
walked
about
half
a
mile
after
leaving
the
woods
when
they
saw
a
figure
approaching
them
it
was
not
far
away
when
they
first
noticed
that
figure
and
it
appeared
strangely
familiar
they
came
nearer
and
nearer
the
familiar
outlines
of
the
approaching
figure
grew
more
and
more
distinct
at
last
the
figure
came
close
up
to
them
and
then
suspicions
became
a
delightful
certainty
yes
it
was
no
other
than
pat
himself
a
wild
uproar
of
cheers
and
voluble
questionings
greeted
the
returning
wanderer
when
did
you
get
out
of
the
woods
they
asked
whin
is
it
sure
it
wor
ony
five
minutes
where

noise

gave
up
everything

was
only
by
chance
that
we
found
the
road
we
have
just
been
talking
about
you
we
were
thinking
about
going
into
the
woods

but
come
boys
it
s
getting
darker
and
darker
we
mustn
t
stand
dawdling
here
all
night
hurry
up
and
come
saying
this
bruce
strode
forward
and
all
the
boys
followed
xvi
and
unaccountable
reunion
of
the
two
wandering
a
tremendous
circle
described
by
where
are
we
going
scott
s
bay
or
hall
s
descent
into
the
twinkling
sudden
sound
of
sea
surf
breaking
in
the
middle
of
a
and
now
every
moment
it
grew
darker
and
darker
it
was
about
eight
o
clock
the
sun
had
gone
down
the
shadows
of
night
were
gathering
and
the
fog
seemed
thicker
than
ever
as
they
walked
on
they
could
see
but
a
few
paces
before
them
they
supposed
themselves
to
be
going
in
the
direction
of
the
house
where
the
wagons
were
left
but
after
all
they
were
not
quite
sure
of
the
way
it
might
be
some
other
road
altogether
they
had
been
over
the
scott
s
bay
road
once
or
twice
before
but
it
would
not
have
been
familiar
even
by
daylight
while
in
such
gloom
as
this
no
road
however
familiar
could
be
recognized
as
they
went
they
peered
anxiously
through
the
gloom
in
hopes
of
seeing
cultivated
fields
or
houses
but
nothing
of
the
kind
appeared
to
their
anxious
eyes
they
also
looked
forward
with
straining
eyes
and
listened
with
the
closest
attention
in
hopes
of
meeting
with
some
people
who
might
make
them
acquainted
with
their
actual
position
but
nothing
could
be
either
seen
or
heard
in
front
and
so
they
had
nothing
else
to
do
than
to
walk
on
as
quickly
as
their
wearied
limbs
would
allow
at
length
they
heard
the
sound
of
voices
ahead
and
footsteps
which
seemed
to
approach
them
they
stood
and
waited
soon
a
number
of
figures
appeared
rendered
gigantic
by
the
mist
and
darkness
the
boys
hurried
towards
them
and
bruce
at
once
addressed
the
foremost
figure
the
foremost
figure
at
the
same
instant
addressed
bruce
and
both
asked
exactly
the
same
question
or
rather
part
of
what
would
evidently
have
been
the
same
question
if
it
had
been
finished
it
was
will
you
be
kind
enough
to
tell
me
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
tell
me
here
the
questions
broke
off
abruptly
and
turned
to
hallo
why
what
s
this
dr
porter
bruce
rawdon
for
a
few
moments
both
parties
were
overwhelmed
with
utter
bewilderment
and
a
total
prostration
of
all
their
faculties
this
amazing
and
incomprehensible
reunion
of
those
who
had
parted
five
hours
ago
in
the
wild
woods
by
the
lofty
precipice
and
the
thundering
surf
going
in
exactly
opposite
directions
yet
coming
together
in
darkness
and
fog
was
a
thing
which
might
well
reduce
them
to
complete
stupefaction
then
there
arose
a
general
uproar
of
questions
each
party
asking
the
other
where
they
had
been
and
where
they
supposed
themselves
to
be
now
and
where
they
thought
they
were
going
this
is
a
most
incomprehensible
thing
said
the
doctor
how
long
have
you
been
on
the
road
sir
not
over
a
quarter
of
an
have
you
been
in
the
woods
all
the
time
yes
walking
steadily
in
this
and
could
you
manage
to
keep
a
straight
course
o
you
didn
t
walk
along
the
cliff
did
you
sir
o
i
don
t
see
how
you
managed
to
go
on
straight
when
you
were
in
the
o
i
managed
by
my
eye
said
the
doctor
calmly
i
also
tried
to
correct
that
tendency
to
swerve
to
the
right
that
you
spoke
of
and
i
think
i
succeeded
you
see
i
found
i
was
very
much
farther
away
from
hall
s
harbor
than
i
supposed
in
fact
your
conjecture
must
have
been
right
and
we
were
nearer
scott
s
bay
by
a
great
deal
than
we
were
to
hall
s
harbor
we
had
swerved
very
much
to
the
right
as
i
went
on
i
became
convinced
of
this
and
tried
constantly
and
most
carefully
to
guard
against
it
i
succeeded
therefore
in
going
almost
in
a
perfectly
straight
line
but
our
march
was
a
very
fatiguing
one
i
must
confess
it
grew
dark
too
and
we
were
just
on
the
point
of
giving
up
when
we
came
to
a
pasture
field
and
then
found
the
road
we
didn
t
see
any
houses
near
and
couldn
t
find
how
far
away
any
house
might
be
at
first
i
thought
of
going
to
hall
s
harbor
but
finally
i
concluded
to
turn
to
the
left
and
go
on
towards
cornwallis
but
you
how
did
you
happen
to
lose
your
course
so
completely
why
you
ve
made
a
complete
circle
you
must
have
been
turning
to
the
right
ever
since
you
left
you
ve
got
into
the
hall
s
harbor
road
and
are
now
walking
straight
towards
hall
s
harbor
what
a
most
extraordinary
and
most
absurd
situation
i
wouldn
t
have
believed
this
to
be
possible
had
it
not
been
first
for
my
own
mistake
and
now
for
this
one
of
yours
but
it
seems
to
me
bruce
that
your
circle
has
been
more
complete
than
mine
was
what
a
tremendous
march
you
must
have
made
bruce
for
a
few
minutes
said
nothing
the
doctor
s
quiet
way
of
informing
him
about
his
situation
bewildered
him
more
than
the
first
discovery
had
done
a
tremendous
circuit
it
must
indeed
have
been
how
had
they
managed
to
go
so
fast
and
reach
the
road
before
the
doctor
s
party
it
must
have
been
that
chase
after
pat
which
put
them
astray
after
that
they
had
lost
all
idea
of
their
way
and
had
wandered
on
blindly
not
knowing
where
they
were
going
and
for
that
matter
not
caring
very
much
either
but
are
you
sure
that
this
is
the
hall
s
harbor
road
he
asked
at
length
why
yes
of
course
it
is
it
ought
to
be
we
ve
come
far
enough
to
get
to
it
what
did
you
think
it
was
why
we
thought
it
was
the
scott
s
bay
the
scott
s
bay
road
cried
the
doctor
and
burst
into
a
hearty
fit
of
laughter
well
sir
said
bruce
to
tell
the
truth
we
got
utterly
lost
pat
began
chasing
a
porcupine
and
we
chased
pat
and
followed
him
wherever
he
went
at
last
we
lost
him
so
then
we
didn
t
think
about
reaching
the
road
at
all
but
only
about
finding
him
we
went
on
in
the
direction
which
he
seemed
to
have
taken
and
so
we
came
to
this
road
it
was
the
porcupine
that
led
us
here
the
porcupine
said
the
doctor
and
he
appeared
so
amused
at
this
idea
that
bruce
had
to
tell
him
the
whole
story
the
fact
is
said
the
doctor
thoughtfully
after
hearing
this
story
what
you
ought
to
have
done
is
this
you
ought
at
all
hazards
to
have
followed
the
line
of
the
cliff
that
would
have
brought
you
to
scott
s
bay
in
a
little
more
than
an
hour
you
could
then
have
gone
to
the
house
where
the
horses
were
left
and
by
this
time
you
would
have
been
in
comfortable
quarters
pitying
us
poor
well
said
bruce
we
tried
to
keep
close
by
the
cliff
but
it
ran
off
in
such
a
direction
that
we
left
it
and
went
in
what
we
thought
a
truer
ha
ha
laughed
the
doctor
that
is
always
the
way
the
cliff
was
right
but
you
were
wrong
the
cliff
did
not
turn
away
from
you
but
you
turned
away
from
the
cliff
it
was
all
that
fatal
tendency
to
turn
to
the
right
now
i
was
on
my
guard
but
you
who
gave
me
that
warning
forgot
all
about
it
yourself
but
come
it
won
t
do
to
stand
here
all
night
talking
we
are
now
about
half
way
over
the
mountain
we
ought
soon
to
begin
to
descend
towards
cornwallis
there
s
a
man
who
lives
on
this
road
that
i
m
acquainted
with
a
smalley
and
his
house
can
t
be
very
far
away
we
can
get
something
to
eat
there
at
least
and
accommodations
for
the
night
but
i
prefer
getting
wagons
and
driving
over
to
where
we
left
our
own
conveyances
however
we
can
see
about
that
when
we
get
to
smalley
the
whole
party
now
walked
on
and
the
boys
mingled
with
one
another
questioning
each
other
about
the
journey
the
doctor
s
party
had
suffered
fearfully
they
were
all
and
their
clothes
were
badly
torn
they
had
gone
through
swamps
and
brushwood
and
over
stones
and
fallen
trees
they
were
fearfully
fatigued
and
were
now
only
sustained
by
the
prospect
of
soon
reaching
the
end
of
their
journey
all
this
was
a
great
puzzle
to
bruce
s
party
who
were
not
nearly
so
fatigued
and
they
couldn
t
understand
how
they
could
have
gone
so
much
farther
than
the
doctor
s
party
without
feeling
so
worn
out
as
their
friends
were
they
attributed
this
however
first
to
the
fact
that
the
doctor
had
gone
in
one
perfectly
straight
course
regardless
of
obstacles
and
secondly
to
the
other
fact
that
their
journey
had
been
beguiled
by
pat
s
adventure
with
the
porcupine
which
first
afforded
them
amusement
and
afterwards
when
he
was
lost
created
such
an
excitement
that
they
forgot
their
toils
after
walking
some
distance
farther
the
road
to
their
great
delight
began
to
descend
we
re
going
down
to
cornwallis
said
the
doctor
joyously
we
re
very
much
farther
on
than
i
supposed
we
are
evidently
far
beyond
smalley
s
i
see
how
it
is
in
my
anxiety
to
avoid
swerving
to
the
right
i
have
fallen
as
you
said
bruce
into
the
opposite
extreme
and
have
actually
swerved
to
the
left
that
accounts
for
the
immense
length
of
our
journey
well
now
that
it
s
over
i
m
glad
that
it
happened
so
it
brings
us
all
the
nearer
to
our
destination
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
lives
atkins
who
will
give
us
far
better
accommodation
than
smalley
one
mile
more
boys
only
one
mile
and
then
we
ll
have
the
doctor
s
encouraging
words
cheered
all
the
boys
and
the
fact
that
they
were
actually
descending
the
hill
and
were
thus
every
moment
drawing
nearer
to
their
destination
had
an
additional
influence
in
giving
them
fresh
energy
so
they
descended
farther
and
farther
and
now
kept
on
the
lookout
more
vigilantly
than
ever
for
the
welcome
lights
of
some
houses
it
s
a
long
descent
said
the
doctor
but
every
step
is
bringing
us
nearer
to
atkins
s
so
keep
your
courage
up
boys
for
we
ll
soon
be
there
on
they
went
and
descended
lower
and
lower
till
at
last
they
seemed
to
have
reached
the
plain
for
the
road
became
level
and
went
on
straight
without
any
more
windings
at
length
there
appeared
a
faint
light
not
far
away
on
the
left
that
must
be
atkins
s
said
the
doctor
but
how
very
thick
the
fog
is
even
here
i
never
knew
it
so
thick
in
cornwallis
and
the
air
is
just
like
that
of
the
it
is
very
seldom
that
it
is
so
on
this
side
of
the
i
suppose
it
s
the
strong
southerly
wind
said
bart
yes
i
dare
the
wind
seems
to
strike
us
here
from
a
very
odd
direction
it
must
come
across
the
basin
of
minas
it
s
just
as
though
it
came
from
the
o
we
can
t
tell
said
the
doctor
this
road
winds
so
that
we
get
it
sometimes
in
our
faces
and
sometimes
in
our
it
must
be
after
nine
said
bruce
yes
said
the
doctor
and
i
dare
say
we
ve
passed
several
houses
on
the
road
the
people
here
are
not
very
liberal
in
the
use
of
candles
they
sit
around
the
kitchen
fire
till
about
nine
o
clock
and
then
go
to
bed
that
s
the
reason
why
we
have
not
seen
any
lights
there
must
be
quite
a
number
of
houses
along
by
this
time
they
had
come
in
front
of
the
house
it
stood
about
a
dozen
yards
from
the
road
the
light
proceeded
from
a
small
lower
window
the
house
was
only
a
cottage
and
the
dim
outline
of
a
barn
could
be
seen
a
little
farther
on
this
does
not
look
like
atkins
s
said
the
doctor
after
he
had
scanned
the
cottage
and
the
barn
atkins
s
is
very
much
larger
than
this
and
is
a
different
looking
place
altogether
i
don
t
think
we
can
have
passed
it
no
it
must
be
farther
on
at
any
rate
we
can
ask
here
and
they
can
tell
us
exactly
how
far
we
have
yet
to
go
i
m
sorry
it
isn
t
atkins
s
though
for
i
fully
expected
to
be
there
besides
we
all
want
the
doctor
looked
once
more
at
the
house
and
then
at
the
barn
as
they
stood
there
thus
looking
in
silence
there
came
to
their
ears
a
very
peculiar
sound
which
made
every
one
start
it
was
a
long
rolling
sound
made
up
of
the
rush
of
many
waters
such
as
can
be
heard
nowhere
else
but
upon
the
that
peculiar
noise
of
gathering
floods
such
as
is
heard
when
the
sea
throws
forth
its
waves
towards
the
land
to
curl
up
foaming
and
break
upon
the
strand
here
it
arose
amid
this
darkness
that
peculiar
that
unmistakable
sound
with
its
gathering
waters
its
foam
its
roll
and
its
crash
as
the
uplifted
waters
broke
the
sound
that
can
be
made
by
the
surf
and
the
surf
alone
but
what
did
it
mean
what
was
the
meaning
of
the
surf
breaking
thus
upon
the
inner
side
of
the
north
mountain
far
inland
on
the
plains
of
cornwallis
were
the
dikes
broken
down
was
this
some
flood
pouring
in
over
the
country
to
overwhelm
them
was
the
raging
sea
now
rolling
in
undisturbed
possession
of
its
ancient
bed
over
all
the
green
valleys
of
this
lately
smiling
plain
was
there
the
terrific
visitation
of
a
deluge
here
in
this
peaceful
country
and
were
all
the
people
now
flying
from
the
horrors
of
an
inundation
what
did
it
mean
up
to
this
moment
there
had
not
been
a
doubt
in
the
minds
of
any
of
them
that
they
were
near
atkins
s
somewhere
in
cornwallis
on
the
hall
s
harbor
road
the
doctor
s
quiet
positiveness
the
perfect
certainty
with
which
he
had
spoken
and
the
minute
acquaintance
which
he
seemed
to
have
with
every
part
of
their
past
and
present
journey
all
conspired
to
impress
upon
the
minds
of
the
boys
the
very
idea
of
their
possible
locality
which
was
in
his
own
mind
and
thus
it
happened
that
it
was
while
they
fully
believed
themselves
entering
upon
a
wide
plain
that
they
suddenly
heard
the
thunder
of
the
surf
upon
the
shore
the
doctor
heard
this
as
plainly
as
any
of
them
of
course
and
all
the
thoughts
which
came
to
them
came
to
him
also
none
the
less
vividly
but
he
said
not
a
single
he
stood
mute
and
waited
for
a
few
moments
longer
as
though
doubting
the
evidence
of
his
senses
once
more
the
sound
arose
the
waters
gathered
themselves
together
they
rolled
forward
they
heaped
themselves
upward
they
foamed
and
then
they
broke
upon
the
shore
thus
wave
after
wave
the
surf
came
on
and
spoke
of
the
presence
of
the
sea
it
was
enough
i
don
t
know
where
in
the
world
we
have
got
to
ejaculated
the
doctor
at
last
it
can
t
be
cornwallis
said
bruce
we
must
be
on
the
shore
of
minas
basin
said
bogud
i
think
it
s
pereau
said
bart
i
don
t
know
where
it
is
said
the
doctor
but
bruce
i
shouldn
t
be
surprised
if
you
should
prove
right
a
second
time
but
the
best
way
is
to
go
and
saying
this
the
doctor
hurried
to
the
door
of
the
cottage
as
they
drew
near
a
strong
smell
of
fish
arose
and
formed
a
new
and
striking
proof
of
the
presence
of
the
sea
reaching
the
door
the
doctor
knocked
loudly
and
all
the
boys
gathered
round
to
hear
the
result
of
his
inquiry
and
learn
their
fate
at
first
there
was
no
response
the
doctor
knocked
again
footsteps
were
now
heard
and
a
voice
cried
out
who
s
there
friends
said
the
doctor
we
ve
lost
our
way
and
want
to
find
go
round
to
the
back
door
this
n
won
t
open
said
the
voice
at
this
they
turned
away
to
look
for
the
back
door
wondering
as
they
went
what
the
occupant
of
the
house
supposed
a
front
door
was
made
for
it
seemed
to
them
like
stories
which
they
had
read
of
some
dutch
villages
where
the
people
are
so
excessively
neat
that
the
front
door
and
the
best
room
are
never
used
except
on
two
great
occasions
one
being
a
marriage
and
the
other
a
burial
at
all
other
times
the
back
door
and
the
back
rooms
are
used
so
to
this
back
door
they
tried
to
work
their
way
round
the
house
as
they
went
round
the
smell
of
decayed
fish
came
up
more
strongly
more
overpoweringly
and
more
impressively
than
ever
evidently
the
people
of
the
cottage
had
something
to
do
with
fish
they
either
caught
them
or
traded
in
them
or
cured
them
who
were
they
was
it
pereau
or
was
it
what
turning
the
house
the
fresh
wind
came
upon
them
driving
against
them
the
dense
fog
clouds
and
hiding
everything
before
them
from
view
but
through
that
gloom
there
swept
upon
their
hearing
a
recurrence
of
the
solemn
boom
of
the
surf
which
had
startled
them
a
few
moments
before
when
they
first
paused
to
look
at
the
cottage
there
it
came
the
sound
of
the
gathering
waters
rising
gradually
breaking
and
flinging
the
roar
of
the
falling
waters
far
away
along
the
shore
here
they
were
then
by
the
sea
here
the
surf
rolled
here
were
the
signs
of
fish
evidently
these
people
were
fishermen
and
their
life
was
on
the
ocean
wave
suddenly
they
encountered
some
large
object
which
was
right
in
their
way
through
the
gloom
they
could
see
the
outline
of
a
whaling
boat
that
is
a
boat
sharp
at
both
ends
which
is
often
used
by
fishermen
in
these
waters
this
excited
no
surprise
however
it
only
confirmed
what
had
been
told
them
by
the
booming
surf
and
the
odors
wafted
from
the
decaying
fish
on
reaching
the
rear
of
the
house
they
found
the
aforsaid
back
door
wide
open
and
a
man
standing
in
the
doorway
with
a
candle
in
one
hand
and
a
pipe
in
the
other
the
candle
flared
and
flickered
and
sputtered
in
the
wind
and
fog
and
he
was
blinking
through
the
darkness
and
trying
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
his
visitors
he
was
a
short
man
with
whiskers
running
all
round
in
a
sea
dog
sort
of
fashion
checked
shirt
and
canvas
trousers
which
bore
numerous
marks
made
by
tar
his
waistcoat
was
unbuttoned
so
as
to
give
free
play
to
the
organs
of
his
manly
chest
he
had
no
coat
and
for
that
matter
no
boots
in
point
of
fact
he
was
in
his
stocking
feet
his
grizzled
hair
and
beard
showed
him
to
belong
to
the
elderly
class
of
mankind
but
his
stout
sturdy
frame
and
bluff
countenance
exhibited
no
decay
of
strength
lost
yer
way
said
he
as
he
caught
sight
of
them
wal
come
in
any
how
we
ll
talk
it
over
walk
in
all
on
ye
the
whole
fifty
of
ye
for
that
matter
ole
bennie
grigg
can
find
room
for
ye
walk
in
walk
but
where
are
we
asked
the
doctor
what
place
is
this
what
place
haw
haw
haw
what
don
t
you
even
know
the
place
haw
haw
haw
why
this
here
place
is
scott
s
bay
xvii
bennie
and
mrs
what
old
bennie
was
able
to
spread
before
his
famished
a
night
on
a
a
secluded
a
morning
behind
hurrah
boys
scott
s
bay
the
emotions
of
the
doctor
and
all
his
party
on
hearing
that
name
can
better
be
imagined
than
described
at
first
they
could
scarcely
believe
it
but
finally
seeing
that
they
knew
nothing
at
all
about
it
and
that
bennie
grigg
as
he
called
himself
might
be
supposed
to
know
where
he
was
living
they
were
forced
to
admit
the
truth
of
the
amazing
statement
but
bennie
gave
them
no
time
for
wonder
he
forced
them
all
to
come
in
and
ushered
them
into
a
large
room
where
a
bright
wood
fire
was
blazing
upon
an
ample
hearth
here
his
wife
received
the
unexpected
guests
she
was
a
quiet
quaint
comfortable
body
fit
helpmeet
for
bennie
and
received
them
in
the
most
cordial
maimer
with
the
true
spirit
of
hospitality
bennie
forbore
from
asking
any
question
but
devoted
his
whole
energies
towards
making
his
guests
comfortable
he
pulled
forward
an
settee
drew
forth
the
quaint
old
chairs
and
soon
had
a
circle
of
seats
arranged
around
the
fire
where
all
could
be
accommodated
after
this
his
wife
spread
the
cloth
over
a
large
table
and
began
to
make
preparations
for
a
repast
you
ll
be
fairly
starving
said
bennie
to
the
doctor
interrogatively
the
doctor
acknowledged
that
they
were
hungry
but
begged
bennie
not
to
put
himself
out
bread
and
butter
and
milk
were
all
that
they
wanted
at
this
bennie
laughed
and
bennie
laughed
also
and
the
latter
busied
herself
in
getting
ready
the
repast
while
bennie
was
thus
employed
bennie
assisted
her
and
at
the
same
time
urged
his
guests
to
make
themselves
comfortable
so
they
talked
with
one
another
around
the
fire
and
at
length
relapsed
into
silence
the
fact
is
they
were
all
awfully
hungry
at
last
the
table
was
spread
and
such
a
spread
o
ye
farmers
of
cornwallis
ye
fishermen
of
scott
s
bay
are
there
indeed
other
farmers
and
other
fishermen
on
this
terrestrial
ball
that
can
make
extemporaneous
spreads
like
yours
i
doubt
it
for
here
bennie
and
his
wife

and
various
other
articles
of
a
minor
character
all
of
which
the
starving
wayfarers
attacked
with
ravenous
appetites
while
and
bennie
looked
on
with
faces
that
beamed
all
over
with
inexpressible
gratification
it
was
not
until
the
first
cravings
of
hunger
were
satisfied
that
bennie
ventured
to
speak
to
his
guests
about
their
wanderings
the
doctor
then
told
him
all
in
the
full
discussion
that
followed
the
whole
thing
was
made
plain
and
their
wanderings
were
all
accounted
for
in
the
first
place
it
was
seen
that
bruce
s
party
in
spite
of
their
carelessness
and
of
their
chase
after
pat
had
actually
reached
the
point
at
which
they
had
aimed
the
scott
s
bay
road
and
were
on
their
way
to
the
place
where
the
horses
were
kept
when
the
doctor
met
them
and
turned
them
back
secondly
the
doctor
s
wanderings
with
his
party
now
became
intelligible
he
had
set
out
with
the
idea
in
his
mind
of
avoiding
that
fatal
tendency
to
swerve
to
the
right
of
which
bruce
had
spoken
but
against
this
he
had
guarded
so
carefully
that
it
had
led
to
a
swerving
in
the
opposite
direction
as
he
himself
had
already
partially
acknowledged
that
is
to
say
he
had
steadily
swerved
to
the
left
the
consequence
was
that
he
had
led
his
followers
over
a
long
and
fatiguing
journey
in
a
complete
circle
until
at
last
he
had
actually
brought
them
into
the
scott
s
bay
road
but
he
thinking
he
had
gone
in
an
exact
straight
line
supposed
it
to
be
the
hall
s
harbor
road
as
he
wished
to
go
to
cornwallis
he
had
therefore
turned
to
the
left
and
gone
forward
under
this
false
idea
and
thus
had
met
bruce
s
party
who
were
going
in
the
proper
direction
he
had
made
them
turn
back
with
him
and
had
thus
led
them
to
scott
s
bay
never
imagining
that
he
could
be
wrong
until
that
awful
moment
when
the
ominous
roar
of
the
surf
showed
him
that
he
must
be
very
far
away
from
where
he
supposed
himself
to
be
old
bennie
laughed
loud
and
long
as
he
listened
to
the
story
of
their
wanderings
and
his
laughter
struck
pleasantly
and
cheerily
upon
their
ears
for
they
had
all
been
refreshed
by
the
generous
repast
which
their
host
had
spread
before
them
and
a
new
life
had
arisen
within
them
their
past
wanderings
were
now
nothing
more
than
amusing
reminiscences
the
table
lay
before
them
with
its
bounteous
store
beside
them
the
big
broad
hearth
sustained
its
load
of
crackling
fire
logs
among
which
the
flames
danced
and
leaped
up
merrily
and
there
was
in
the
broad
apartment
a
certain
joyous
and
social
atmosphere
beneath
whose
influence
all
their
natures
relaxed
into
a
kindly
and
genial
glow
and
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
the
repast
afforded
a
full
and
complete
compensation
for
all
the
toils
of
the
day
they
slept
that
night
variously
the
doctor
had
a
room
to
himself
the
settee
formed
a
bed
on
which
jiggins
and
bogud
reposed
sammy
and
johnny
blue
slumbered
on
straw
beds
stretched
on
the
floor
as
for
the
rest
they
slept
in
the
barn
on
the
hay
which
they
preferred
to
anything
which
the
house
could
offer
bennie
tried
to
tempt
them
with
various
mattresses
spread
over
the
kitchen
floor
but
they
chose
the
haymow
and
bennie
himself
finally
declared
that
such
a
choice
showed
their
sense
the
next
morning
came
they
all
arose
refreshed
the
fog
had
all
cleared
away
the
sun
shone
brightly
and
all
the
scene
were
displayed
before
their
eyes
they
found
scott
s
bay
village
to
be
a
place
of
about
five
hundred
inhabitants
who
lived
chiefly
by
fishing
to
which
they
added
farming
there
was
also
a
here
which
occasionally
in
a
busy
seasop
added
largely
to
the
population
the
houses
were
generally
neat
and
situated
along
the
road
all
around
the
scenery
was
magnificent
the
bay
was
a
small
indentation
behind
blomidon
formed
by
a
long
projecting
spur
of
the
north
mountain
which
ran
on
one
side
of
the
straits
of
minas
and
terminated
in
those
rugged
and
sublime
fragments
of
shattered
and
rock
that
give
to
that
point
the
name
of
cape
split
the
beach
was
a
long
crescent
that
extended
for
about
two
miles
and
was
bounded
at
either
extremity
by
lofty
precipices
before
it
lay
the
blue
waters
of
the
bay
of
fundy
with
the
long
precipitous
line
of
coast
on
either
side
and
immediately
in
front
though
many
miles
away
rose
a
solitary
island
with
perpendicular
sides
and
flat
summit
known
by
the
name
of
ile
haute
both
to
the
old
acadians
who
thus
named
it
and
to
their
english
successors
that
day
was
sunday
and
they
had
to
remain
in
the
village
the
doctor
however
found
occupation
there
was
no
clergyman
stationed
here
but
there
was
a
little
chapel
where
services
were
held
about
once
a
month
here
he
performed
the
duties
of
his
sacred
office
and
the
villagers
hearing
of
his
arrival
turned
out
in
force
the
doctor
had
a
crowded
house
and
was
so
gratified
by
their
attendance
in
the
morning
and
so
touched
by
their
quiet
but
earnest
attention
that
he
held
forth
again
in
the
afternoon
as
to
the
mistake
that
the
doctor
had
made
he
acknowledged
it
in
the
handsomest
manner
in
the
presence
of
all
the
boys
he
said
that
bruce
had
been
right
and
he
had
been
wrong
he
acknowledged
his
ignorance
of
the
woods
and
advised
them
if
they
ever
again
went
roaming
through
the
forest
never
to
trust
to
the
guidance
of
a
doctor
of
divinity
he
felt
that
he
might
be
of
some
small
service
in
guiding
them
through
figurative
forests
in
pointing
out
the
true
way
through
that
obscure
wood
by
which
dante
once
symbolized
this
world
of
man
but
as
to
ever
again
leading
them
or
having
anything
to
do
with
them
in
any
literal
material
wood
he
begged
to
be
excused
and
he
also
advised
them
not
to
have
anything
to
do
with
him
he
praised
them
all
for
their
patient
endurance
in
following
him
and
hoped
finally
that
they
would
look
back
upon
this
adventure
with
such
pleasant
memories
that
all
the
troubles
that
they
had
endured
would
be
forgotten
on
the
other
hand
every
one
of
the
boys
declared
that
they
had
had
a
most
delightful
time
and
that
they
would
not
want
a
better
leader
than
the
doctor
all
of
which
showed
plainly
that
the
toil
and
trouble
of
these
wanderings
had
already
been
forgotten
in
the
peace
and
pleasure
which
had
marked
their
journey
s
end
there
remained
now
the
consideration
of
their
homeward
journey
on
saturday
night
the
doctor
had
spoken
to
bennie
about
it
and
bennie
said
he
would
see
about
getting
conveyances
for
them
as
far
as
the
place
where
the
doctor
s
horses
had
been
left
but
the
doctor
refused
to
let
him
make
any
arrangements
on
sunday
as
he
wished
to
be
back
at
grand
pré
on
monday
in
time
to
begin
the
school
he
saw
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
get
bennie
s
conveyances
without
breaking
the
sabbath
but
he
couldn
t
do
this
so
there
was
only
one
alternative
and
that
was
to
start
very
early
on
monday
morning
and
walk
to
the
place
where
the
horses
were
this
he
determined
to
do
so
on
monday
morning
at
four
they
all
rose
and
after
partaking
of
a
substantial
breakfast
they
bade
and
bennie
an
affectionate
farewell
and
departed
it
was
about
five
before
they
left
it
was
past
seven
when
they
reached
their
destination
the
doctor
found
the
horses
and
wagons
all
safe
but
it
took
some
time
to
feed
the
former
and
it
was
after
eight
o
clock
before
they
were
able
to
start
then
they
drove
home
as
fast
as
they
could
they
arrived
at
the
hill
at
about
eleven
but
the
hour
for
commencing
school
was
nine
the
doctor
s
family
and
simmons
and
long
were
quite
anxious
about
the
absentees
the
school
had
not
been
opened
they
were
waiting
for
the
return
of
the
wanderers
and
thus
when
the
wanderers
at
length
returned
they
found
that
their
delay
had
resulted
in
giving
them
an
additional
holiday
for
the
school
could
not
begin
on
that
day
that
was
evident
and
thus
they
found
themselves
blessed
with
another
reprieve
from
study
hurrah
boys
xviii
what
is
it
pat
busy
among
the
small
a
great
supper
and
a
sudden
the
midnight
general
flight
of
the
grand
a
solemn
in
the
bold
the
cupola
and
the
abyss
the
that
afternoon
pat
was
very
busy
among
the
smaller
boys
he
asked
them
many
questions
about
the
noise
in
the
attic
and
found
there
was
great
terror
among
them
for
the
noises
had
been
heard
both
on
saturday
night
and
sunday
night
by
those
who
were
in
that
building
and
they
were
so
terrified
that
they
would
not
have
staid
there
a
third
night
if
the
other
boys
had
not
come
back
a
superstitious
awe
had
settled
down
deep
into
their
minds
and
they
conversed
with
one
another
on
this
subject
in
subdued
whispers
pat
found
them
in
this
condition
and
managed
to
make
them
still
more
terrified
before
he
left
them
some
of
them
were
anxious
to
tell
one
of
the
teachers
about
it
all
but
pat
dissuaded
them
by
declaring
that
it
would
be
of
no
use
and
that
they
would
only
be
laughed
at
for
their
pains
many
of
the
other
boys
also
on
coming
back
felt
a
return
of
their
former
fear
and
looked
forward
to
the
approach
of
night
with
some
uneasiness
pat
made
himself
quite
busy
with
these
boys
too
and
although
he
said
nothing
very
directly
yet
he
made
many
mysterious
hints
that
implied
a
great
deal
he
alluded
to
his
own
fearful
position
with
his
bed
in
that
very
garret
separated
by
only
a
board
partition
from
the
dark
haunts
of
the
mystery
he
spoke
of
his
past
experience
and
it
seemed
as
though
if
he
only
chose
he
could
easily
unfold
a
tale
whose
lightest
word
would
harrow
up
their
souls
only
he
didn
t
the
boys
begged
him
to
tell
all
but
pat
wouldn
t
he
shook
his
head
with
deep
and
solemn
meaning
and
the
boys
looked
on
him
with
a
profounder
awe
and
pat
when
he
went
up
to
his
haunted
chamber
was
regarded
as
some
poor
victim
on
his
way
to
his
doom
pat
however
was
not
regarded
in
this
light
by
all
some
there
were
who
held
aloof
from
this
feeling
of
awe
among
these
was
bart
who
could
not
help
noticing
pat
s
movements
and
was
very
much
impressed
by
them
though
in
a
way
very
different
from
that
in
which
the
other
boys
were
affected
he
saw
how
pat
managed
to
stimulate
the
excited
imaginations
of
others
without
saying
anything
directly
and
heard
him
lament
most
lachrymosely
his
hard
fate
in
having
to
occupy
a
room
in
so
fearful
a
place
he
happened
to
be
near
the
group
to
which
pat
was
talking
and
could
not
help
saying
well
pat
my
room
s
just
underneath
yours
and
if
anything
happens
you
can
take
refuge
with
me
i
ll
give
you
a
sofa
for
the
deed
thin
an
you
ll
find
me
comin
down
some
night
said
pat
ony
maybe
i
mightn
t
iver
git

the
same
thing
that

dhrive
me

prevint

then
i

what
to

like
old
harry
and
i
ll
go

never
get
up
why
not
it
wouldn
t
let
it
what
it
why
it
the
wan
that
the
one
that
walks
that
s
just
what
it
doesn
t
do
it
s
very
bad
at
you
d
soon
see
if
ye
d
iver
find
him
any
how
he
d
shtop
yer
comin
till
my
stop
me
nonsense
how
can
it
stop
me
when
it
s
in
the
cupola
as
he
said
this
bart
looked
in
an
expressive
manner
at
pat
pat
looked
away
and
shook
his
head
whether
he
suspected
that
bart
know
all
or
not
he
did
not
give
him
back
any
look
of
intelligence
or
show
any
confusion
he
simply
looked
away
and
said
well
well
aich
wan
must
have
his
own
opinion
well
know
betther
perhaps
some
bart
smiled
and
turned
away
soon
he
joined
bruce
and
arthur
i
ve
given
pat
one
or
two
hints
already
said
he
that
i
saw
through
the
business
and
i
ve
just
given
him
another
it
s
a
shame
for
him
to
go
frightening
the
small
boys
that
way
i
was
going
to
arrange
it
all
or
next
day
so
that
they
would
look
on
it
as
a
joke
but
pat
is
keeping
up
the
gloomy
tragic
character
and
there
ll
be
more
disturbance
only
he
d
better
look
out
i
ve
given
him
fair
warning
there
s
poor
little
harry
thompson
with
his
face
as
pale
as
a
sheet
it
isn
t
fair
it
ll
have
to
be
shall
we
stop
it
well
no
we
had
better
wait
till
we
see
if
it
goes
on
and
whether
pat
s
hand
can
be
discerned
in
it
if
we
do
find
it
so
i
really
don
t
see
any
reason
why
he
should
be
from
this
it
will
be
seen
that
bart
had
already
made
his
friends
acquainted
with
the
discovery
which
he
had
made
in
the
garret
and
that
they
had
decided
upon
some
general
plan
of
action
they
did
not
wish
to
put
an
end
to
the
affair
too
prematurely
or
clumsily
but
rather
to
terminate
it
in
as
brilliant
a
manner
as
possible
as
this
day
was
positively
the
last
of
the
holidays
the
b
c
determined
to
celebrate
it
by
a
modest
supper
in
the
rawdons
rooms
solomon
was
accordingly
called
upon
and
as
always
he
showed
himself
equal
to
the
occasion
personally
he
was
all
smiles
and
joyousness
his
little
black
beads
of
eyes
twinkled
incessantly
his
face
actually
shone
and
his
complexion
was
a
rich
oily
sepia
he
made
desperate
efforts
to
preserve
an
air
of
profound
solemnity
but
occasionally
a
short
sharp
snort
of
a
laugh
would
burst
forth
after
which
his
face
would
at
once
regain
its
mask
of
gravity
dar
said
he
as
he
put
the
last
dish

with
these
words
solomon
welcomed
them
to
the
feast
that
he
had
prepared
the
boys
seated
themselves
around
the
groaning
board
and
gave
themselves
up
to
the
joy
of
the
occasion
they
fought
their
battles
o
er
again
they
went
over
all
the
events
of
the
holidays
again
they
drifted
through
the
dense
fog
or
wandered
through
the
trackless
forest
again
they
waded
through
deep
waters
or
dug
deep
in
the
solid
ground
as
they
thus
chattered
and
laughed
solomon
stood
surveying
them
with
a
beaming
smile
illuminating
all
his
dark
but
expressive
features
and
all
the
time
he
kept
whispering
to
himself
words
expressive
of
his
feelings
on
dat
ar
suddenly
all
this
was
interrupted
it
was
late
all
was
still
all
the
other
boys
seemed
to
have
gone
to
bed
outside
the
night
was
quite
dark
and
then
and
there
amid
that
stillness
and
in
that
darkness
it
rang
out
right
over
their
heads
it
was
again
that
peculiar
sound
which
they
had
once
before
heard
a
long
shrill
abrupt
discordant
shriek
repeated
again
and
again
and
echoing
dismally
throughout
the
gloomy
extent
of
the
long
unfinished
garret
and
dying
away
in
the
far
distances
with
low
and
melancholy
intonations
the
ceiling
above
them
only
intervened
between
this
room
and
the
garret
so
that
they
could
hear
it
very
plainly
as
the
sound
rang
out
solomon
started
he
was
that
moment
lifting
a
plate
and
the
plate
fell
from
his
nerveless
hands
crashing
on
the
floor
his
face
seemed
to
turn
to
a
sickly
he
staggered
back
and
leaned
against
the
wall
at
that
moment
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
this
completed
solomon
s
horror
his
knees
gave
way
his
teeth
chattered
his
eyes
rolled
fearfully
he
sank
upon
the
floor
and
remained
there
in
a
sitting
posture
come
in
shouted
bruce
hallo
solomon
what
s
the
matter
get
up
are
you
faint
here
take
a
drink
of
water
why
man
what
s
the
matter
encouraged
by
bruce
s
words
solomon
made
a
great
effort
and
got
up
edging
away
behind
the
boys
as
far
from
as
he
could
get
no
one
had
come
in
and
so
arthur
went
to
the
door
and
opened
it
nobody
was
there
as
he
stood
wondering
jiggins
s
door
opened
and
jiggins
made
his
appearance
clad
in
the
habiliments
of
the
night
hallo
jiggins
said
arthur
did
you
knock
me
knock
me
no
said
jiggins
i
i
was
just
in
bed
and
asleep
and
heard
that
howl
above
and
then
there
came
a
knock
i
thought
it
was
you
wanting
to
see
no
none
of
us
somebody
did
and
some
one
knocked
at
our
door
too
said
arthur
what
does
it
all
mean
said
jiggins
by
this
time
the
other
boys
were
out
in
the
hall
and
were
looking
at
one
another
bart
looked
along
the
floor
to
see
if
the
knock
could
have
been
produced
by
a
stone
thrown
behind
tom
might
be
seen
solomon
afraid
to
be
too
far
behind
and
yet
not
daring
to
venture
forward
it
s
queer
said
arthur
i
don
t
like
it
said
jiggins
solemnly
it
somehow
don
t
seem
right
i

really
uncomfortable

about
that
is
not

boys
said
bart

said
bart
i

see
you
down
stairs
if
you
like
at
that
instant
there
sounded
out
a
deep
toll
from
the
great
bell
in
the
cupola
it
was
one
single
toll
but
so
profound
so
awful
and
so
solemn
did
that
solitary
knell
peal
forth
through
the
still
night
air
that
even
those
who
felt
no
fear
could
not
avoid
an
involuntary
sensation
of
awe
solomon
clutched
at
bart
s
arm
and
looked
as
though
he
had
no
life
left
in
him
that
settles
it
said
bart
that
s
a
little
too
much

and
then

run

it
to
your
room
wait
a
minute
down
went
bart
with
solomon
shuddering
and
quaking
at
his
heels
and
finally
reached
the
door
now
then
solomon
he
said
run
for
away
went
solomon
in
a
frenzy
of
fear
his
whole
frame
shuddering
in
vague
superstitious
terror
his
brain
reeling
with
excitement
his
fancy
crowded
with
images
of
horror
away
he
went
he
burst
into
the
he
raced
up
the
stairs
he
rushed
into
his
room
as
before
banged
all
the
furniture
against
the
door
and
lay
crouched
in
a
corner
and
quaking
till
morning
bart
returned
at
once
boys
said
jiggins
it
s
a
solemn
time
a
deeply
solemn
time
won
t
you
come
up
jiggins
no
boys
said
jiggins
and
i
warn
you
not
to
go
up
that
s
a
solemn
place
a
deeply
solemn
well
come
up
and
help
us
to
feel
the
solemnity
said
bart
jiggins
shook
his
head
i
don
t
like
the
looks
of
it
said
he
it
s
too
solemn
there
s
a
certain
something
about
it
that
makes
me
feel
a
kind
of
a
a
degree
of
a
solemnity
that
a
but
jiggins
s
voice
died
away
upon
the
ears
of
the
boys
as
they
ascended
the
stairs
before
he
could
finish
what
he
was
trying
to
say
the
object
of
the
boys
in
going
up
now
was
first
to
find
the
cause
of
the
knock
and
secondly
to
find
the
cause
of
the
tolling
bell
they
thought
that
perhaps
some
one
might
be
concealed
in
the
attic
and
so
they
looked
about
very
carefully
in
all
directions
tom
stood
at
the
head
of
the
attic
stairs
so
as
to
bar
the
way
to
any
possible
fugitive
the
others
then
went
all
over
the
attic
most
carefully
beginning
at
the
end
next
pat
s
room
and
so
on
over
to
the
open
space
under
the
cupola
crossing
this
they
searched
all
over
the
farther
end
they
peeped
into
every
nook
and
corner
they
left
nothing
unexamined
but
at
length
they
were
forced
to
give
up
this
search
for
nothing
could
be
found
coming
back
therefore
they
stood
in
silence
by
the
open
space
under
the
cupola
and
looked
down
into
the
gloomy
yawning
chasm
over
which
went
the
narrow
plank
pathway
and
tried
to
peer
through
the
deep
gloom
of
this
place
after
standing
here
for
some
time
they
crossed
to
the
other
side
on
their
way
back
and
were
hero
joined
by
tom
boys
said
bart
we
can
t
get
at
the
bottom
of
that
knock
that
s
evident
but
we
oughtn
t
to
go
till
we
find
out
about
the
bell
what
do
you
say
to
going
up
very
well
said
bruce
only
we
can
t
take
the
of
course
not
and
even
if
we
did
the
wind
would
blow
them
out
but
it
don
t
make
any
difference
about
that
we
can
feel
about
you
know
if
any
one
s
in
the
cupola
we
ll
have
him
and
find
out
who
he
i
ll
put
the
lamp
on
the
plank
here
said
tom
and
it
will
throw
some
light
no
said
arthur
it
might
get
shaken
off
and
then
good
by
to
the
old
academy
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
that
old
below
would
be
in
flames
put
it
over
there
on
the
floor
never
mind
whether
it
throws
up
any
light
or
not
we
can
all
go
up
in
the
dark
just
as
tom
thereupon
put
his
lamp
on
the
solid
floor
of
the
garret
and
after
this
the
whole
party
walked
the
plank
and
reached
the
foot
of
the
ladders
that
ran
up
to
the
cupola
there
were
two
of
these
and
in
climbing
up
one
had
to
work
his
way
through
a
of
beams
in
the
daytime
this
was
troublesome
enough
to
an
unpractised
hand
and
in
the
dark
would
have
been
impossible
but
these
boys
knew
every
inch
of
the
way
and
could
go
up
almost
as
easily
in
the
dark
as
in
the
light
bart
went
first
bruce
next
then
arthur
then
phil
and
tom
came
last
the
first
ladder
was
slightly
slanting
in
one
direction
and
terminated
at
a
narrow
board
from
which
the
second
ladder
went
up
slanting
in
an
opposite
direction
to
the
cupola
they
went
up
quite
nimbly
and
rapidly
considering
the
total
darkness
and
soon
reached
the
cupola
bart
was
up
there
first
in
the
middle
of
the
cupola
and
hanging
immediately
over
the
opening
through
which
they
came
up
was
the
great
bell
whose
deep
solemn
tones
were
familiar
enough
to
them
from
the
summons
which
it
hourly
sent
forth
during
term
time
but
whose
solitary
knell
sounding
as
it
lately
did
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
had
struck
such
sudden
awe
into
their
hearts
all
around
the
bell
was
room
enough
to
walk
and
to
look
out
of
the
windows
of
the
cupola
bart
had
reached
the
cupola
first
and
he
at
once
walked
round
it
to
find
if
any
one
was
concealed
here
the
circuit
was
made
by
the
time
bruce
had
come
up
who
immediately
went
round
as
bart
had
done
then
the
others
came
up
well
said
phil
what
s
the
luck
there
s
no
one
here
said
bart
have
you
felt
everywhere
he
couldn
t
get
up
above
there
could
he
o
perhaps
he
s
outside
said
arthur
at
this
suggestion
they
all
flung
open
the
shutters
which
surrounded
the
cupola
and
as
it
was
too
dark
to
see
they
felt
in
all
directions
with
their
hands
they
soon
found
however
that
no
one
was
there
now
said
phil
the
question
is
how
in
the
that
bell
have
tolled
all
were
silent
for
a
few
minutes
trying
to
conjecture
some
possible
way
it
will
be
seen
that
on
this
occasion
bruce
had
not
a
vestige
of
his
former
superstitious
feeling
the
affair
with
the
donkey
had
taught
him
a
salutary
lesson
and
the
discovery
that
bart
had
made
when
communicated
to
him
had
made
him
angry
with
himself
for
the
fear
which
he
had
felt
before
he
was
perfectly
convinced
now
that
there
was
some
trick
which
was
the
only
cause
of
the
knock
and
the
toll
of
the
bell
and
this
he
tried
to
discover
suddenly
he
stooped
down
and
felt
under
the
bell
boys
said
he
after
a
pause
do
you
think
a
fellow
could
ring
the
bell
without
coming
up
into
the
cupola
by
some
very
simple
process
do
you
think
a
string
tied
to
the
tongue
could
do
it
what
cried
all
in
great
excitement
and
all
of
them
sprang
forward
to
feel
for
themselves
but
bruce
warded
off
their
hands
wait
said
he
the
string
s
here
stand
back
i
want
to
see
where
it
goes
the
boys
fell
back
now
in
greater
excitement
than
ever
the
string
was
a
common
piece
of
twine
bruce
followed
it
and
found
that
it
went
across
to
the
side
of
the
cupola
facing
their
end
of
the
building
and
then
it
was
passed
through
a
crevice
close
to
the
floor
and
passed
outside
but
where
bruce
pulled
the
string
the
other
end
was
fastened
but
by
the
resistance
he
could
tell
that
it
ran
for
a
long
distance
there
s
only
one
place
that
it
goes
to
of
course
said
bart
and
that
is
pat
s
room
but
why
in
the
world
he
should
get
up
this
passes
my
comprehension
we
ll
have
to
teach
him
a
lesson
xix
puzzling
how
to
meet
the
a
strange
diamond
cut
diamond
or
a
donkey
in
a
surprise
of
jiggins
on
seeing
the
the
fated
moment
the
donkey
confronts
the
garret
the
power
of
a
the
boys
remained
in
the
cupola
for
some
time
longer
once
bruce
had
the
satisfaction
of
feeling
the
string
become
suddenly
tight
in
his
hands
he
held
it
thus
for
a
moment
as
though
to
assure
himself
of
the
fact
and
then
gave
it
a
sudden
pull
it
yielded
the
whole
string
was
in
his
hands
bruce
fell
down
on
the
floor
and
his
whole
frame
shook
with
smothered
laughter
what
in
the
world
s
the
matter
with
you
bruce
cried
bart
the
string
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
the
string
ha
ha
the
string
the
string
well
what
about
the
string
why
i
ve
got
it
i
felt
it
grow
tight
ha
ha
ha
and
i
gave
it
a
jerk
ha
ha
ha
and
it
came
ha
ha
ha
ha
and
now
pat
s
wondering
what
s
become
of
it
ha
ha
ha
ha
and
he
s
thinking
that
the
ghost
he
was
shamming
must
be
a
real
one
after
all
either
bruce
s
laughter
was
contagious
or
else
the
boys
saw
something
irresistibly
funny
in
pat
s
supposed
consternation
at
losing
the
string
but
whatever
was
the
cause
the
boys
burst
forth
also
into
fits
of
laughter
which
however
they
tried
to
smother
as
well
as
they
could
and
now
the
question
was
what
to
do
at
first
they
were
going
to
take
the
string
away
but
they
finally
decided
to
leave
it
just
as
it
was
so
as
to
see
what
pat
would
do
under
the
circumstances
after
coming
to
this
conclusion
they
decided
to
go
to
bed
for
the
night
and
defer
any
further
consideration
of
the
subject
till
the
following
day
when
they
would
feel
fresher
and
less
fatigued
so
they
descended
once
more
and
separated
for
the
night
the
next
morning
they
found
the
excitement
greater
than
ever
all
who
were
in
the
main
building
had
heard
the
noises
of
the
night
and
some
in
the
had
heard
the
toll
of
the
bell
jiggins
was
sad
and
exceedingly
solemn
bogud
went
about
saying
that
none
of
them
could
tell
what
might
happen
which
language
might
be
taken
to
signify
an
undeniable
truism
or
on
the
other
hand
it
might
be
considered
as
a
suggestion
of
the
existence
of
some
profound
gloomy
and
inscrutable
mystery
bogud
rather
preferred
that
it
should
be
taken
in
that
light
muckle
johnny
sammy
and
billymack
all
announced
that
they
thought
there
was
something
in
it
and
shook
their
heads
with
dark
meaning
and
impressive
emphasis
over
the
whole
business
pat
was
as
usual
only
a
little
more
so
he
was
active
in
all
kinds
of
hints
he
refused
to
tell
his
own
experience
of
the
night
but
suggested
something
grand
gloomy
and
peculiar
he
looked
like
one
who
wished
none
to
question
him
about
the
secrets
of
his
prison
house
he
expressed
a
mournful
resignation
to
that
hard
fate
which
made
him
the
neighbor
of
the
fearful
denizens
of
the
garret
and
meekly
but
firmly
refused
the
offers
of
several
boys
to
give
him
accommodation
till
the
trouble
should
cease
also
pat
had
an
excellent
appetite
and
his
ruddy
face
and
bright
eyes
belied
the
cultivated
mournfulness
of
his
expression
bart
had
gone
up
into
the
cupola
before
breakfast
and
had
found
that
the
string
was
taken
away
he
at
once
concluded
that
pat
had
been
up
and
had
quietly
removed
it
for
the
day
if
he
had
felt
any
consternation
at
having
the
string
jerked
from
his
hands
he
had
no
doubt
got
completely
over
it
and
probably
attributed
it
to
some
ordinary
cause
very
different
from
the
real
one
pat
s
demeanor
was
such
that
the
boys
saw
his
evident
determination
to
keep
up
the
excitement
he
went
about
as
before
among
the
small
boys
heightening
their
fears
and
giving
any
number
of
dark
suggestions
to
their
excited
imaginations
bogud
and
jiggins
and
sammy
and
johnny
and
billymack
and
muckle
also
sought
pat
s
society
and
left
it
more
confirmed
than
ever
in
their
opinions
jiggins
was
more
than
ever
convinced
that
it
was
a
deeply
solemn
season
in
fact
he
kept
saying
so
to
everybody
all
day
long
the
teachers
could
not
be
ignorant
of
the
excitement
but
they
took
no
notice
of
it
they
thought
it
was
some
harmless
trick
of
some
of
the
more
mischievous
boys
which
did
not
call
for
their
intervention
as
yet
but
would
probably
be
revealed
in
the
natural
course
of
things
so
the
boys
were
all
left
to
themselves
at
nine
o
clock
the
school
was
once
more
opened
after
so
many
delays
and
the
duties
of
the
new
term
commenced
alas
the
first
day
of
a
new
term
what
a
horror
it
brings
to
the
heart
of
a
boy
fresh
from
the
green
fields
from
the
blue
sky
from
the
fragrant
woods
the
babbling
brook
the
sounding
shore
the
lofty
precipice
the
bounding
wave
from
all
these
he
enters
into
the
gloom
and
darkness
and
confinement
of
the
can
there
be
any
wonder
that
the
fresh
young
boyish
heart
should
quail
and
his
bounding
young
life
droop
and
his
uproarious
spirits
flag
on
that
dreary
first
day
where
is
his
life
in
which
of
late
he
so
exulted
where
is
that
grand
face
of
mother
nature
so
dear
to
every
boy
where
are
the
odor
of
the
fields
the
balsamic
air
of
the
forest
the
invigorating
smell
of
the
salt
sea
these
are
the
loved
memories
that
afflict
him
at
his
dingy
desk
the
first
day
at
school
for
a
boy
is
homesickness
in
its
broadest
sense
i
don
t
think
anybody
can
be
so
homesick
as
a
boy
may
be
nor
can
a
boy
at
any
other
time
be
so
homesick
as
at
such
a
time
as
this
homesickness
moreover
is
not
merely
a
pining
for
one
s
actual
home
but
it
is
also
a
yearning
for
pleasures
that
have
fled
some
lost
grace
of
life
some
sweet
charm
which
has
passed
away
now
none
of
our
boys
were
at
all
inclined
to
what
they
called
spooniness
but
still
they
could
not
help
feeling
the
common
evil
of
boy
humanity
the
school
hours
passed
slowly
and
heavily
and
they
tried
to
cheer
themselves
with
the
thought
that
it
would
not
be
so
unpleasant
in
a
few
days
after
they
had
become
used
to
it
after
school
was
over
the
b
engaged
in
an
earnest
discussion
over
the
situation
one
common
resolution
was
in
all
their
minds
and
that
was
to
put
an
end
to
the
ghost
in
the
garret
but
how
was
it
to
be
done
we
might
quietly
go
and
tell
the
fellows
all
about
it
said
tom
yes
said
bart
but
that
would
be
too
clumsy
what
i
want
is
something
more
artistic
i
want
a
dramatic
close
in
which
there
shall
be
a
scene
full
of
effect
if
we
could
only
work
it
so
as
to
let
the
thing
bring
itself
to
a
conclusion
in
some
effective
way
it
would
be
a
great
deal
more
satisfactory
to
all
i
should
like
some
way
said
bruce
in
which
pat
would
be
conscious
that
he
was
completely
used
up
and
i
think
that
among
us
five
we
might
arrange
a
counterplot
against
his
pat
certainly
deserves
some
sort
of
punishment
for
the
way
he
has
been
frightening
the
small
boys
he
has
been
at
it
all
day
i
dare
say
he
s
at
it
now
of
course
before
dark
he
ll
sneak
up
and
fasten
his
string
to
the
tongue
of
the
bell
again
so
as
to
get
all
ready
for
the
night
s
we
can
easily
find
some
way
i
should
think
said
arthur
of
paying
off
pat
without
being
cruel
in
any
way
to
him
a
smart
shock
administered
delicately
and
neatly
would
about
suit
my
idea
of
the
yes
but
how
can
we
get
something
which
will
be
mild
yet
smart
delicate
yet
effective
that
s
the
point
which
we
don
t
seem
able
to
as
they
talked
in
this
way
they
were
walk
ing
up
the
hill
towards
the
old
french
orchard
as
they
neared
the
place
bart
s
eyes
wandered
over
the
adjoining
pasture
field
and
rested
on
the
form
of
that
donkey
which
had
borne
so
large
a
share
in
the
experiences
of
the
past
few
days
i
have
it
he
cried
suddenly
what
asked
they
the
donkey
what
about
it
he
shall
help
how
the
donkey
s
our
plan
we
ll
play
him
off
against
the
ghost
and
pat
the
donkey
was
once
a
ghost
himself
he
ll
be
the
very
one
to
do
the
thing
up
properly
he
s
had
experience
after
performing
so
successfully
at
the
hole
at
our
expense
you
can
t
place
any
limit
to
his
capacity
yes
boys
the
donkey
s
the
very
i
don
t
see
what
good
the
donkey
s
going
to
be
said
phil
what
good
the
very
thing
we
how
asked
bruce
pat
won
t
come
up
here
to
get
frightened
said
arthur
and
his
room
is
too
far
up
for
us
to
make
the
donkey
bray
under
it
said
tom
very
true
said
bart
but
then
what
s
to
prevent
our
marching
the
donkey
up
into
the
garret
what
marching
him
up
into
the
the
boys
looked
puzzled
can
you
get
him
up
of
course
we
but
think
of
the
horrible
racket
he
d
make
going
up
we
couldn
t
keep
it
o
yes
we
could
we
could
fix
him
so
that
he
could
go
up
without
any
noise
in
how
why
by
putting
bits
of
carpet
around
each
of
his
feet
we
could
then
get
him
up
stairs
somehow
a
basket
of
oats
for
the
boys
thought
for
a
time
and
then
burst
into
fits
of
laughter
at
the
idea
you
see
said
bart
it
would
be
the
most
magnificent
thing
ever
undertaken
on
this
hill
besides
how
splendid
it
would
be
to
bring
our
ghost
face
to
face
with
pat
s
own
private
ghost
and
let
them
confront
each
other
what
a
tremendous
stupendous
overwhelming
and
altogether
unparalleled
uproar
there
would
be
pat
would
then
be
confronted
with
something
different
from
anything
that
he
had
been
calculating
on
we
d
break
down
the
panic
of
the
boys
and
it
would
all
end
in
a
roar
of
but
what
a
row
there
ll
be
exclaimed
phil
i
wonder
which
party
ll
begin
said
arthur
pat
s
side
of
course
said
bruce
i
hope
said
tom
that
our
side
ll
do
his
o
we
ll
have
to
keep
him
up
to
it
donkey
s
that
can
bray
and
won
t
bray
must
be
made
to
he
s
such
an
obstinate
brute
said
arthur
that
i
don
t
believe
we
ll
be
able
to
do
o
we
ll
manage
that
said
bruce
the
five
of
us
are
strong
enough
to
pull
him
along
if
he
won
t
go
we
can
get
a
whip
or
a
stout
stick
somewhere
said
phil
no
said
bart
no
beating
if
we
can
help
it
i
m
averse
on
principle
to
all
corporal
punishment
i
formed
a
deep
prejudice
against
it
in
my
early
school
days
no
boys
remember
what
pope
says
if
i
had
a
donkey
and
he
wouldn
t
go
d
ye
think
i
d
wallop
him
no
no
on
the
contrary
i
would
endeavor
if
possible
to
secure
his
cooperation
with
our
plans
by
the
gentler
method
of
moral
suasion
oats
for
or
a
good
fat
or
a
handful
of
or
a
cold
boiled
or
some
delicate
after
some
further
consideration
they
came
to
the
conclusion
to
make
an
attempt
to
carry
out
the
donkey
proposal
that
very
night
in
the
course
of
the
evening
various
things
were
prepared
a
number
of
bits
of
old
carpet
with
some
cord
were
most
conspicuous
among
these
preparations
their
plan
was
based
on
the
supposition
that
pat
had
not
heard
this
donkey
bray
and
was
perhaps
unaware
of
its
existence
here
they
were
quite
sure
that
he
had
not
been
up
near
the
pasture
field
since
the
donkey
came
and
so
he
was
probably
unaware
of
its
presence
consequently
when
pat
began
his
little
tricks
he
would
find
a
startling
cooperator
the
boys
waited
till
all
were
in
bed
and
then
brought
down
the
donkey
they
had
but
little
trouble
in
leading
him
along
they
took
him
into
a
grove
in
front
of
the
academy
and
there
tied
bits
of
carpet
around
each
foot
then
began
their
efforts
to
get
him
up
stairs
here
was
where
they
anticipated
failure
but
to
their
surprise
this
was
accomplished
without
any
very
great
difficulty
the
little
animal
tempted
by
turnips
held
in
front
of
his
nose
encouraged
by
strokings
and
pulled
and
pushed
along
made
a
rush
up
the
first
flight
he
went
up
as
nimbly
as
a
goat
and
didn
t
make
more
noise
than
six
men
pounding
up
with
all
their
might
the
noise
certainly
exceeded
all
that
they
had
calculated
upon
then
came
the
second
flight
the
donkey
went
up
triumphantly
but
by
the
time
he
reached
the
top
he
had
lost
three
of
the
four
bandages
in
which
his
feet
were
tied
here
they
heard
a
door
open
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
bogud
s
voice
calling
what
s
all
that
who
s
there
o
nothing
it
s
only
a
new
student
said
bart
quietly
bogud
s
door
closed
again
they
then
led
the
donkey
on
but
just
as
they
reached
jiggins
s
door
it
opened
and
jiggins
put
forth
his
head
holding
a
candle
out
and
blinking
at
them
to
his
horror
he
saw
immediately
in
front
of
him
the
shaggy
companion
of
the
b
but
at
the
same
moment
he
recognized
the
boys
and
this
reassured
him
what
what
s
all
this
he
gasped
it
s
a
nightmare
said
bart
we
re
taking
him
up
to
fight
the
at
this
the
donkey
looked
amiably
at
the
figure
in
the
doorway
and
making
a
step
forward
put
his
head
through
and
was
about
entering
when
the
occupant
of
the
room
banged
the
door
in
his
face
the
boys
then
resumed
their
journey
but
the
last
flight
was
not
passed
without
a
fearful
racket
and
the
donkey
lost
the
remaining
bandage
at
length
however
they
reached
the
top
and
walking
softly
themselves
they
led
the
donkey
over
to
a
point
near
where
pat
s
room
was
leaving
him
here
they
then
retired
the
donkey
was
thus
left
alone
to
himself
and
to
a
cold
boiled
turnip
which
bart
had
put
under
his
nose
after
a
short
season
of
bewilderment
he
proceeded
to
regale
himself
on
this
the
b
all
separated
and
went
to
bed
the
characters
in
this
drama
were
left
to
take
care
of
themselves
now
pat
in
his
room
at
the
end
of
the
long
garret
had
heard
the
racket
made
by
the
donkey
in
coming
up
and
at
first
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
it
at
length
however
the
noise
ceased
and
for
about
half
an
hour
all
was
still
suddenly
there
came
a
loud
wild
shriek
from
afar
through
the
long
garret
followed
by
others
in
succession
but
pat
did
not
quake
or
shiver
not
he
he
waited
for
a
few
minutes
with
a
pleasant
smile
of
keen
enjoyment
on
his
face
then
he
went
to
the
window
of
his
room
and
pulled
a
string
which
came
in
from
the
outside
and
there
followed
a
deep
solemn
toll
that
broke
upon
the
stillness
of
the
night
with
a
gloomy
and
awful
intonation
carrying
terror
to
many
poor
little
boys
who
heard
it
and
quaked
with
superstitious
fear
the
donkey
had
finished
his
turnip
he
had
begun
to
reflect
on
the
peculiarity
of
his
situation
all
dark
around
no
pleasant
pasture
no
starlit
sky
nothing
but
utter
darkness
he
felt
uncomfortable
he
stood
fixed
in
one
spot
and
the
very
unusual
situation
told
heavily
upon
his
spirits
had
he
been
in
some
comfortable
stall
or
some
sequestered
pasture
he
might
have
lain
down
and
slept
the
sleep
of
the
donkey
but
he
had
been
badgered
and
deceived
and
such
a
getting
up
stairs
he
never
had
seen
and
now
in
the
midst
of
these
reflections
there
came
this
uproar
of
shrieks
and
tolling
bells
it
was
too
much
it
was
not
at
all
what
he
was
accustomed
to
so
he
proceeded
to
enter
a
protest
against
the
whole
business
the
donkey
raised
his
head
he
elevated
his
tail
he
spread
his
legs
apart
so
as
to
gain
a
firmer
attitude
then
he
burst
forth
he
haw
he
haw
heeeeee
haaaaaaw
he
haw
he
haw
he
haaaaaaaaaw
heeeeeeeeeee
haaaaaaaaaaaaw
heeee
haaaww
he
haaaaw
the
noise
of
that
terrific
bray
as
it
sounded
out
burst
forth
close
by
pat
he
was
on
one
side
of
the
partition
the
donkey
was
on
the
other
he
was
just
about
seizing
the
cord
so
as
to
give
another
pull
to
the
tongue
of
the
bell
when
there
arose
this
unexpected
this
tremendous
interruption
whether
pat
had
ever
heard
the
bray
of
a
donkey
before
mattered
not
at
that
moment
he
certainly
had
never
before
heard
a
donkey
and
an
injured
donkey
too
at
midnight
in
a
garret
close
beside
him
pour
forth
so
suddenly
and
so
terribly
and
so
deafeningly
such
accumulated
woes
had
a
cannon
suddenly
exploded
close
by
pat
s
elbow
he
could
not
have
been
more
utterly
overwhelmed
he
sprang
back
for
a
moment
he
stood
paralyzed
then
he
jumped
at
the
door
he
tore
it
open
he
leaped
down
the
stairs
bart
s
room
was
at
the
bottom
he
opened
the
door
burst
in
and
banged
it
and
locked
it
behind
him
then
he
stood
against
the
door
making
the
pressure
of
his
back
an
additional
barrier
against
the
entrance
of
any
pursuer
xx
complete
and
final
revelation
of
the
great
garret
confession
of
pat
indignation
of
his
speech
on
the
the
authorities
of
the
school
pat
and
the
b
are
hauled
up
to
give
an
hallo
cried
bart
who
was
roused
by
the
noise
who

a
faint
voice

s
up
by
this
time
bart
had
got
out
of
bed
and
had
reached
the
where
pat
was
still
standing
against
the
door

needn
t
talk
to
me
that
at
this
moment
the
distant
bray
of
the
donkey
sounded
once
more
pat
clutched
bart
s
arm
and
cried
there
it
is
agin
it
s
a
coomin
o
i
knowed
that
said
bart
opening
the
door
and
listening
why
that
s
only
the
bray
of
a
donkey
you
ve
heard
it
often
enough
t
you
the
bray
of
a
donkey
faltered
pat
sure
it
s
me
that
s
heard
well
this
must
be
but
who
ivir
heard
of
a
donkey
in
a
garret
o
i
dare
say
he
s
strolled
up
there
to
visit
your
friend
in
the
and
now
bart
not
caring
to
prolong
pat
s
terror
explained
the
cause
of
the
noise
that
had
terrified
him
letting
him
know
at
the
same
time
why
it
was
done
he
told
pat
that
they
found
out
about
the
screech
and
the
bell
and
sent
up
the
donkey
so
as
to
give
him
a
little
taste
of
that
fear
which
he
was
so
anxious
to
give
to
others
as
they
had
given
him
a
shock
he
was
satisfied
had
pat
been
at
all
an
fellow
he
might
have
resented
all
this
but
as
he
was
one
of
the
fellows
in
the
world
he
showed
not
the
smallest
particle
of
resentment
on
the
contrary
the
moment
the
load
of
horror
was
lifted
off
by
bart
s
disclosure
his
buoyant
spirits
rose
at
once
and
all
burst
forth
to
the
full
swing
of
his
jovial
mirthful
ridiculous
reckless
irish
temperament
faith
an
it
s
me
that
s
caught
deed
an
it
is
so
thin
he
cried
with
a
burst
of
laughter
an
ye
got
the
donkey
up
to
the
garret
sure
it
bates
the
wurruld
so
it
does
an
didn
t
i
hair
the
noise
but
how
cud
i
ivir
dhrame
it
wor
that
an
ye
got
him
jist
close
fornist
me
so
ye
did
it
wor
just
in
me
own
air
that
he
hooted
so
it
pat
now
grew
quite
communicative
and
told
bart
all
about
it
his
motive
for
creating
an
excitement
was
simply
to
get
a
chance
of
laughing
at
the
other
boys
who
had
so
often
laughed
at
him
there
was
no
malice
whatever
in
his
intention
nothing
at
all
of
the
nature
of
vengefulness
but
simply
a
mischievous
and
thoughtless
idea
of
throwing
some
ridicule
on
the
boys
generally
bart
s
discovery
of
the
truth
was
known
to
him
but
he
did
not
care
for
that
he
was
determined
to
keep
up
his
little
joke
as
long
as
it
could
be
kept
up
he
had
been
startled
that
night
when
the
string
had
been
jerked
from
his
hand
but
afterwards
concluded
that
it
was
the
wind
the
knock
at
the
doors
he
explained
very
simply
he
had
stolen
up
barefoot
and
as
the
screech
sounded
he
had
struck
each
door
with
a
stick
and
then
ran
he
was
down
below
before
they
could
see
him
all
this
pat
explained
with
perfect
ease
and
much
merriment
regarding
it
all
as
a
good
joke
not
even
excepting
the
last
affair
with
the
donkey
but
what
it
may
be
asked
was
that
screech
which
had
been
the
beginning
of
it
all
it
was
all
explained
on
the
following
morning
early
on
that
morning
the
donkey
had
been
brought
down
stairs
with
little
difficulty
but
with
an
immense
amount
of
noise
as
the
boys
brought
him
out
pat
marched
quietly
after
them
carrying
an
enormous
owl
one
by
one
the
boys
heard
the
news
the
whole
school
came
flocking
out
to
look
upon
the
objects
of
their
late
terror
gradually
the
whole
story
came
out
and
the
boys
in
their
sudden
recoil
from
a
general
panic
now
gave
way
to
the
wildest
uproar
and
merriment
a
laughing
procession
followed
the
donkey
to
his
rural
home
while
pat
took
the
owl
down
into
the
kitchen
to
get
some
meat
for
it
from
solomon
meanwhile
solomon
had
heard
of
the
revelation
of
the
dark
mystery
and
was
running
out
to
satisfy
himself
when
he
met
pat
half
way
o
de
sakes
now
cried
old
solomon

he
solomon
stood
looking
at
the
owl
for
a
few
moments
then
he
made
a
low
bow
with
absurd
extravagance
of
gesture
then
he
burst
forth
in
a
strange
tone
which
seemed
like
a
desperate
attempt
at
sarcasm

he
then
made
another
low
bow
after
which
he
went
on
with
an
attempt
at
more
scathing
sarcasm
than
ever
in
which
there
was
also
visible
a
tinge
of
something
like
indignation

he
drew
up
his

with
severe
dignity
but
pat
coaxed
and
pleaded
and
the
end
of
it
was
that
solomon
was
prevailed
on
to
give
him
a
piece
of
meat
the
owl
devoured
it
greedily
and
then
pat
took
him
away
to
his
owner
the
bird
as
pat
said
belonged
to
slocum
who
lived
about
two
miles
away
he
had
received
him
as
a
very
fine
specimen
of
a
screech
owl
from
a
sea
captain
who
had
brought
him
from
abroad
and
had
got
tired
of
him
slocum
happened
to
be
in
halifax
at
the
time
and
brought
the
bird
home
in
triumph
a
few
weeks
before
during
the
previous
week
he
had
escaped
and
had
found
his
way
through
an
open
window
of
the
cupola
into
the
garret
pat
had
discovered
him
first
and
as
his
terrific
hoot
sounded
out
frightening
the
boys
he
took
advantage
of
the
circumstance
to
perform
a
few
additional
tricks
of
his
own
with
the
consequences
that
have
been
narrated
it
was
only
on
the
previous
day
that
pat
had
found
out
who
was
the
owner
of
the
wandering
bird
he
happened
to
hear
people
speaking
of
it
in
the
village
store
as
he
was
making
some
purchases
so
now
that
the
whole
affair
had
come
to
an
end
he
thought
he
might
as
well
restore
the
lively
bird
to
its
rightful
owner
meanwhile
the
donkey
had
been
taken
to
his
pasture
and
the
boys
returned
and
school
began
and
the
business
of
the
day
soon
engrossed
their
whole
attention
after
school
pat
and
the
boys
of
the
b
received
a
message
from
long
requesting
them
to
come
to
his
study
for
the
affair
had
spread
and
the
teachers
had
learned
all
about
it
of
course
it
was
a
thing
that
could
not
be
passed
over
after
some
discussion
however
it
was
considered
that
it
was
not
of
sufficient
importance
to
be
brought
before
porter
and
so
long
was
requested
to
see
all
the
boys
concerned
in
the
affair
and
afterwards
report
long
s
study
was
a
room
situated
immediately
under
bart
s
he
generally
left
at
nine
in
the
evening
and
slept
elsewhere
consequently
he
had
not
been
in
the
way
of
hearing
those
voices
of
the
it
was
to
this
room
then
that
the
b
together
with
pat
bent
their
steps
trying
to
conjecture
what
long
proposed
to
do
about
it
xxi
to
mr
long
and
the
they
get
a
tremendous
pat
to
the
mr
long
the
unhidden
captain
corhet
and
the
irrepressible
coming
in
joy
to
depart
in
the
relics
a
solemn
a
speech
a
poem
a
procession
all
ending
in
a
consignment
of
the
exhumed
treasure
to
its
as
they
entered
the
study
they
found
long
seated
in
an
by
his
study
table
he
looked
at
them
with
a
grave
and
severe
countenance
and
motioned
them
to
seats
they
sat
down
said
long
in
a
cold
and
constrained
voice
none
of
you
will
accuse
me
of
ever
interfering
with
legitimate
sport
or
will
think
that
i
am
destitute
of
sympathy
with
boyish
ways
and
manners
i
think
you
know
me
well
enough
to
believe
that
i
take
a
deep
interest
in
everything
that
can
make
you
enjoy
yourselves
here
that
i
want
you
to
love
this
place
with
all
your
hearts
and
through
all
your
after
lives
to
look
back
upon
grand
pré
academy
with
the
most
affectionate
recollection
that
very
feeling
i
have
now
and
it
is
this
that
animates
me
while
i
call
upon
you
to
give
an
account
of
those
disturbances
in
which
you
have
been
engaged
you
see
a
line
must
be
drawn
somewhere
he
continued
your
affair
at
the
french
cellar
was
not
altogether
what
it
ought
to
have
been
and
i
do
not
approve
of
it
at
all
apart
from
the
lateness
of
the
hour
there
was
about
the
whole
transaction
an
air
of
wildness
a
certain
headlong
recklessness
of
sport
which
i
should
rather
check
than
indulge
still
i
have
nothing
to
say
about
that
now
you
seem
to
have
gone
into
that
affair
with
an
impetuosity
of
pure
fun
that
blinded
you
to
anything
objectionable
which
might
have
been
in
it
besides
you
have
already
told
all
about
that
and
in
a
whimsical
way
that
disarmed
all
reproof
but
boys
resumed
long
in
a
severer
tone
this
last
affair
has
been
really
a
serious
offence
against
discipline
the
school
has
been
disturbed
it
seems
for
many
nights
there
have
been
all
kinds
of
noises
howlings
yellings
and
screechings
of
all
sorts
rappings
and
knockings
now
all
these
things
may
be
very
funny
to
the
contrivers
of
them
but
you
are
surely
old
enough
to
know
that
they
may
be
excessively
dangerous
to
sensitive
minds
did
you
not
think
of
the
poor
little
fellows
here
who
might
receive
a
serious
mental
shock
from
such
disturbances
is
it
possible
that
you
could
have
been
blind
to
all
things
except
your
own
selfish
amusement
is
this
the
sort
of
thing
that
is
becoming
to
you
you
he
repeated
from
whom
i
hoped
nothing
but
examples
of
manliness
and
generosity
and
frankness
and
chivalry
i
will
not
believe
that
it
is
possible
for
you
to
fail
in
these
qualities
i
trust
rather
to
what
i
of
you
and
i
will
attribute
all
this
to
nothing
except
utter
thoughtlessness
on
your
part
and
it
is
that
very
thoughtlessness
if
nothing
worse
that
i
blame
it
was
not
worthy
of
you
it
was
utterly
beneath
you
it
was
a
very
serious
the
boys
fairly
writhed
under
all
this
and
bart
with
his
face
flushing
scarlet
and
his
eyes
gleaming
with
excited
feeling
was
about
to
speak
but
long
commanded
silence
with
his
uplifted
hand
but
what
shall
i
say
he
continued
to
this
last
business
here
everything
reaches
a
climax
not
satisfied
with
having
thrown
the
whole
school
into
a
panic
and
with
making
the
garret
seem
a
haunted
place
to
most
of
the
boys
a
place
in
fact
into
which
none
dared
to
go
but
yourselves
not
satisfied
with
all
this
you
determined
upon
an
act
which
is
sufficient
to
demand
serious
punishment
having
already
raised
an
almost
intolerable
terror
in
the
school
you
deliberately
proceed
to
intensify
even
this
and
raise
that
terror
into
a
perfect
anguish
was
not
the
panic
sufficient
already
did
you
wish
it
to
terminate
in
some
tragedy
would
it
have
been
satisfactory
to
you
if
the
feeble
brain
of
some
of
the
younger
boys
had
given
way
under
this
new
terror
if
some
one
of
them
had
suddenly
gone
mad
as
that
abhorrent
roar
that
mixture
of
howls
and
yells
and
screeches
and
hoots
rising
up
into
an
unearthly
din
and
intermingled
with
the
awful
toll
of
the
bell
had
burst
upon
his
ear
such
things
have
happened
there
have
been
not
boys
but
men
who
have
gone
mad
from
things
even
less
terrible
than
these
why
when
i
think
of
what
might
have
happened
i
shudder
and
i
stand
amazed
at
what
i
charitably
consider
your
thoughtlessness
though
for
such
thoughtlessness
as
this
what
punishment
can
be
adequate
and
now
he
concluded
what
have
you
to
say
for
yourselves
all
this
time
the
faces
of
the
boys
were
like
fire
and
writhing
in
indignation
they
looked
back
at
long
as
he
hurled
against
them
what
they
felt
to
be
unmerited
accusations
they
had
only
been
concerned
in
the
last
affair
for
the
purpose
of
putting
an
effectual
end
to
the
other
but
as
they
sat
there
in
the
consciousness
of
innocence
they
saw
that
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
explain
it
they
could
not
tell
what
they
knew
for
that
would
be
to
accuse
pat
mr
long
burst
forth
bart
starting
up
with
his
face
in
a
flame
and
his
voice
trembling
with
indignation
every
word
that
you
have
uttered
is
utterly
and
totally
undeserved
by
us
i
assure
you
most
solemnly
that
we
have
never
violated
any
principles
of
honor
or
of
chivalry
you
do
not
know
the
facts
sir
or
you
would
never
have
uttered
those
bitter
words
you
have
done
us
great
wrong
sir
we
are
not
deserving
of
such
charges
as
these
we
are
innocent
but
we
are
not
in
a
position
to
bart
paused
for
a
moment
and
in
that
momentary
pause
another
voice
burst
in
as
eagerly
and
as
impetuously
as
his
own
it
was
pat
he
had
started
to
his
feet
just
as
bart
did
but
bart
had
spoken
before
him
as
soon
as
he
could
get
a
chance
he
burst
in
mr
long
he
cries
it
s
all
a
mishtake
what
yer
sayin
as
thrue
as
i
m
standin
here
and
i
m
tellin
no
lie
so
i
ain
t
it
was
me
that
did
it
so
it
was
and
they
knowed
it
was
me
so
they
did
and
it
was
only
to
play
a
little
harrumless
joke
that
i
did
it
i
didn
t
bring
the
owl
there
at
all
at
all
he
coom
there
himself
he
howled
an
the
ony
blame
to
me
wor
that
i
didn
t
tell
what
i
knowed
besides
i
thried
till
alarrum
the
boys
a
bit
nivir
fear
that
wan
av
thim
same
goes
mad
they
indured
the
excitemint
so
they
did
afther
a
day
or
two
i
tied
a
sthring
till
the
an
give
it
a
bit
av
a
pull
an
i
knocked
at
the
dure
and
at
jiggins
an
i
m
the
ony
wan
to

an
if
there
s
till
be
any
punishin
a
goin
i
m
the
wan
that
s
going
till
take
it
so
i
all
these
words
pat
poured
forth
with
feverish
impetuosity
as
though
anxious
to
tell
everything
before
he
could
be
interrupted
not
a
word
did
he
say
about
the
other
boys
and
the
donkey
he
left
it
to
be
inferred
that
he
was
to
be
blamed
for
the
donkey
also
he
intended
the
irish
lad
that
he
should
be
punished
for
that
too
mr
long
cried
bart
bursting
in
since
pat
has
told
about
the
owl
himself
we
can
confess
our
share
we
brought
up
the
an
it
worn
t
a
thrick
said
pat
it
wor
till
frighten
me
so
it
wor
an
make
me
stop
me
an
knockins
that
s
what
it
wor
an
didn
t
i
get
it
i
wor
jest
pullin
the
sthring
that
wor
fastened
till
the
bell
whin
the
donkey
let
aff
a
bray
that
knocked
me
clain
from
me
oun
room
all
the
way
down
stairs
head
over
heels
an
fut
first
that
s
what
it
did
an
that
s
as
thrue
as
i
m
standin
here
a
tellin
av
long
now
began
to
question
them
and
soon
all
the
facts
were
elicited
as
the
truth
became
known
the
severity
of
his
manner
relaxed
and
his
tone
became
pleasant
and
kindly
well
boys
said
he
all
this
puts
the
matter
in
a
very
different
light
the
owl
came
and
screeched
himself
pat
was
only
to
blame
for
assisting
the
excitement
you
were
only
to
blame
for
taking
so
very
violent
a
way
to
stop
the
affair
it
might
have
been
stopped
without
that
if
you
had
simply
told
all
about
it
but
i
see
the
odd
kind
of
motive
you
had
you
merely
wished
to
surround
the
denouement
as
you
say
with
such
absurd
accompaniments
that
no
boy
on
the
hill
would
ever
dare
to
hint
at
a
ghost
again
well
i
may
not
like
your
way
of
going
to
work
but
i
at
least
understand
your
motives
i
need
not
say
how
glad
i
am
at
this
explanation
i
came
here
under
a
false
impression
and
regret
that
i
spoke
with
such
severity
the
only
thing
that
i
blame
about
this
is
that
it
was
what
is
called
a
practical
joke
both
on
pat
s
part
and
on
yours
and
that
is
a
thing
which
i
have
always
endeavored
to
put
down
so
now
boys
he
concluded
let
me
say
at
this
moment
there
came
a
faint
rap
at
the
door
long
looked
at
the
door
but
took
no
further
notice
of
the
sound
thinking
it
was
a
mistake
he
continued
in
a
pleasant
tone
let
me
say
boys
that
i
have
such
confidence
in
all
of
you
that
i
feel
sure
at
this
there
came
another
rap
somewhat
louder
come
in
said
long
the
door
opened
slowly
those
in
the
room
were
behind
it
as
it
opened
and
they
could
not
see
who
was
coming
gradually
it
opened
and
then
there
stepped
forth
the
venerable
form
of
captain
corbet
he
carried
in
his
arms
a
little
bundle
which
he
held
with
the
tenderest
care
and
there
was
on
his
face
an
expression
made
up
of
pride
of
triumph
and
of
a
certain
joyous
consciousness
which
he
possessed
that
he
was
the
bearer
of
that
which
would
not
fail
to
excite
similar
emotions
in
others
the
moment
long
saw
him
and
his
burden
he
started
to
his
feet
looking
very
pale
captain
corbet
stood
in
the
doorway
swaying
his
shoulders
backward
and
forward
so
as
to
afford
an
agreeable
motion
to
his
tender
charge
his
head
hung
on
one
side
and
he
looked
upon
the
company
with
that
peculiar
expression
of
benignity
which
may
be
seen
on
the
face
of
some
indulgent
father
who
has
prepared
some
rich
treat
for
his
children
what
exclaimed
the
venerable
corbet
all
here
all
jined
together
on
this
momentuous
occasion
an
me
afeared
that
some
on
yew

orbs

smile
an
thar
he
saying
this
captain
corbet
proceeded
to
remove
the
coverings
from
the
face
of
his
beloved
burden
long
stood
motionless
and
mute
his
eyes
wandered
to
the
window
captain
corbet
was
standing
in
the
doorway
barring
the
passage
and
slowly
and
tenderly
drawing
aside
the
veil
that
hid
from
view
the
face
that
he
loved
suddenly
long
started
his
resolution
was
taken
he
walked
towards
the
door
captain
corbet
saw
him
not
his
eyes
his
thoughts
and
his
heart
were
all
engaged
in
his
delightful
employment
ah
captain
said
long
hurriedly
i
hope

very
well
is
there
anything
i
can
do
for

i
can
see

ve
just
finished
some
business
which
i
had
with
these
boys
you
will
have
to
be
kind
enough
to
excuse
he
touched
captain
corbet
s
shoulder
and
tried
to
push
him
gently
aside
so
as
to
pass
captain
corbet
s
hand
which
had
been
removing
the
coverings
fell
slowly
to
his
side
his
face
turned
up
and
confronted
long
s
with
an
expression
of
utter
bewilderment
as
though
the
language
which
he
had
heard
was
perfectly
incomprehensible
his
lips
moved
but
no
sound
escaped
you
ll
have
to
excuse
me
said
long
kindly
i
m
in
a
great
hurry
will
you
allow
me
to
pass
mechanically
captain
corbet
moved
to
one
side
long
hurried
out
he
descended
the
stairs
he
walked
rapidly
out
of
the
academy
and
down
into
the
village
and
far
far
away
captain
corbet
stood
at
the
doorway
looking
at
vacancy
at
length
he
turned
there
was
a
certain
blank
amazement
in
his
face
as
though
he
could
not
yet
understand
what
had
happened
he
said
he
was
in
a
hurry
he
murmured
he
s
gone
actilly
an
raelly
and
terewly
gone
an
a
chance
why
it
come
agin
may
be
an
he

boys
he
continued
after
a
pause
in
a
hollow
voice
am
i
a
dereamin
o
no
captain
said
bart
cheerily
you
re
wide
awake
come

the
captain
shook
his
head
pinch
me
said
he
in
the
same
tragic
tone
no
one
obeyed
captain
corbet
heaved
a
heavy
sigh
no
said
he
i
feel
that
i
m

here
s
the
babby
here
s
its
parient
but
i
must
rest
an
meditate
over
this
harrowin
saying
this
he
walked
forward
and
seated
himself
in
long
s
vacated
chair
thar
he
exclaimed
after
a
long
silence
raising
his
meek
face
and
solemnly
regarding
the
boys
thar
it
air
over
that
dream
hath
past
and
fled
an
the
feeble
idee
i
ben
a
hevin
of
long
s
better
natoor
air
totially
overtherrown
by
that
muve
for
it
was
a
perroud
hope
of
the
aged
and
tew
corbet
to
give
thanks
to
the
man
that
delivered
him
from
rewination
in
the
most
way
by
a
bringin
of
the
babby
face
tew
face
with
his
benefacture
an
a
teachin
of
the
tender
infant
to
summile
on
the
author
of
his
footur
fortin
we
met
he
continued
as
a
darker
shade
came
over
his
venerable
countenance
we
met
an
i
thot
we
d
feel
a
mootooil
jy
i
stood
a
lingerin
long
by
yonder
open
portial
a
holdin
of
him
in
suspense
an
a
pictoorin
tew
myself
his
silent
raptoor
why
do
you
know
boys
i
d
even
made
up
my
mind
to
him
hold
the
jest
for
a
leetle
if
he
begged
hard
an
if
the
infant
didn
t
cry
that
s
what
i
was
a
keepin
in
store
for
him
what
do
ye
think
of
that
now
and
after
this
announcement
of
his
late
plan
he
looked
earnestly
at
the
boys
to
witness
the
full
effect
of
that
disclosure
an
what
was
the
result
did
he
spering
tew
meet
me
did
he
clasp
the
babe
did
he
evince
a
mite
of
yearnin
or
kimpassion
did
he
even
try
to
get
a
sight
of
the
pootiest
little
face
zat
ever
was
bress
here
captain
corbet
began
to
show
signs
of
growing
maudlin
but
he
checked
himself
and
went
on
he
not
he
what
did
he
do
young
sirs
you
saw
him
bar
witness
tew
what
i
say
he
took
his
departoor
he
felled
like
an
evil
sperrit
at
the
approach
of
that
cherub
an
i
i
felt
it
sore
i
felt
it
an
i
feel
it
still
yes
i
do
yea
even
down
to
the
toes
of
my
butes
illustration
here
followed
a
long
silence
which
the
boys
did
not
break
for
they
did
not
know
what
to
say
to
soothe
the
woes
of
the
afflicted
captain
at
length
he
looked
up
and
went
on
in
a
tone
of
sadness
in
which
might
be
detected
something
like
resentment
fust
opinions
is
alius
krect
you
mind
boys
what
i
told
you
on
the
briny
deep
i
said
that
the
heart
of
long
was
as
hard
as
the
neither
milestone
terew
when
on
that
eventfooil
trile
he
riz
up
for
me
an
fit
down
my
fiendish
prosecooter
an
gently
tetched
him
up
on
the
roar
by
that
tremenjuous
outbust
abeout
the
babby
when
all
that
was
a
happenin
i
did
think
i
d
a
leetle
him
but
did
i
no
i
come
to
show
a
parient
s
gratitood
by
presentin
before
him
my
most
perecious
treasoor
an
what
was
the
result
what
why
he
met
me
with
his
habitooil
hardheartedness
i
found
him
stiff
as
a
marbial
statoot
cold
an
freezin
as
a
icicle
rugged
an
onfeelin
as
a
rocky
precipious
as
he
ended
he
rose
from
his
chair
the
boys
now
gathered
about
him
and
asked
him
to
come
up
to
bart
s
room
just
overhead
and
let
them
see
his
infant
they
addressed
consoling
words
to
him
and
sought
to
smooth
down
his
ruffled
feelings
but
captain
corbet
shook
his
head
no
boys
said
he
thankee
kindly
you
re
all
right
tain
t
you
tain
t
your
fault
but
i
feel
sore
there
s
somethin
opperessive
in
this
here
intellectooil
atmosphiour
i
must
seek
elsewhere
for
comfort
to
my
ruffled
busom
thankee
kindly
boys
some
other
time
not
now
some
other
saying
this
the
aged
captain
left
the
room
and
descended
the
stairs
and
took
his
departure
the
boys
watched
his
venerable
figure
till
it
paased
out
of
sight
and
the
slow
pace
and
bent
head
and
mournful
mood
of
their
beloved
navigator
touched
all
their
hearts
with
a
common
feeling
of
sympathy
as
captain
corbet
s
retreating
figure
disappeared
from
view
the
boys
turned
away
and
walked
slowly
along
the
front
of
the
academy
with
a
vague
idea
of
taking
a
walk
up
to
the
camp
but
before
they
had
gone
any
great
distance
they
met
porter
boys
said
he
you
ll
be
glad
to
know
that
your
french
relics
are
all
labelled
and
are
now
ready
to
be
taken
to
the
may
we
take
them
there
sir
o
when
now
if
you
like
i
ll
go
back
to
the
house
and
let
you
have
saying
this
the
doctor
turned
back
towards
the
house
followed
by
the
boys
they
found
the
articles
all
neatly
labelled
and
their
names
written
upon
each
label
as
discoverers
and
donors
all
looked
delighted
except
bart
he
read
the
label
on
the
bone
and
there
was
an
expression
on
his
face
which
did
not
escape
the
notice
of
the
doctor
what
s
the
matter
bart
he
asked
you
don
t
seem
why
sir
said
bart
i
didn
t
think
that
this
bone
belonged
to
to
why
what
did
you
think
that
it
did
belong
to
well
sir
i
thought
that
it
belonged
to
the
owner
of
the
the
owner
of
the
house
said
the
doctor
with
a
laugh
well
not
directly
it
belonged
to
his
horse
as
i
think
but
simmons
thinks
it
was
his
cow
that
is
the
only
way
in
which
it
ever
belonged
to
bart
looked
ineffably
disgusted
then
it
s
no
use
putting
an
old
cow
bone
in
the
museum
said
he
o
yes
said
the
doctor
it
was
found
beside
the
plough
and
perhaps
belonged
to
the
horse
or
ox
that
dragged
it
from
that
point
of
view
it
is
a
very
interesting
bart
said
no
more
and
soon
the
boys
retired
on
their
way
to
the
museum
bearing
their
treasures
with
them
boys
said
bruce
it
will
never
do
for
us
to
carry
these
things
up
without
making
some
demonstration
or
other
it
isn
t
every
day
that
we
are
presenting
things
to
the
museum
that
we
ve
dug
out
of
the
that
s
a
capital
idea
cried
bart
who
by
this
time
had
recovered
from
the
shock
of
his
disappointment
so
i
say
said
arthur
but
what
shall
we
do
o
let
s
have
a
speech
and
a
poem
and
a
procession
said
phil
yes
said
tom
bruce
can
make
the
speech
and
bart
can
make
the
this
was
agreed
upon
and
it
was
decided
that
the
ceremony
should
come
off
immediately
before
they
had
an
hour
yet
and
that
gave
them
ample
time
soon
the
news
spread
abroad
and
all
the
boys
flocked
to
the
spot
bruce
ascended
the
portico
and
stood
there
with
the
french
relics
at
his
feet
bruce
had
not
had
much
time
for
preparation
but
then
he
was
very
quick
at
impromptu
speeches
and
the
occasion
did
not
demand
anything
more
than
this
bart
stood
near
scribbling
something
in
his
after
arranging
the
things
in
an
effective
row
and
putting
all
the
coins
inside
the
iron
pot
bruce
commenced
holding
up
the
iron
pot
and
rattling
the
coins
he
began
by
giving
a
humorous
description
of
their
search
after
it
without
going
very
deeply
into
the
real
particulars
of
the
case
he
introduced
into
his
burlesque
narrative
quite
a
number
of
the
actual
facts
after
finishing
this
description
he
showed
the
identical
pot
of
money
which
they
had
exhumed
and
it
was
passed
round
from
hand
to
hand
bruce
then
exhibited
the
ploughshare
and
the
other
irons
the
plough
he
assured
them
belonged
to
the
first
settler
on
this
classic
spot
the
bolts
had
fastened
it
together
and
the
chain
had
drawn
it
through
the
ground
it
was
this
plough
of
which
these
were
the
interesting
relics
that
had
reclaimed
the
hill
from
its
original
wilderness
state
and
made
possible
the
existence
of
that
great
and
glorious
school
to
which
they
at
present
had
the
proud
privilege
of
belonging
finally
he
exhibited
the
bone
porter
he
said
thought
it
was
the
bone
of
a
horse
while
simmons
thought
that
it
once
had
belonged
to
a
cow
or
perhaps
an
ox
for
his
part
he
had
a
theory
of
his
own
he
thought
that
it
was
the
bone
of
that
nightmare
that
had
been
making
such
a
disturbance
among
them
during
the
last
week
that
bone
was
now
going
into
the
museum
and
he
was
confident
that
the
peculiar
animal
to
which
it
belonged
would
never
trouble
the
school
again
as
bruce
ended
he
was
greeted
with
three
cheers
three
more
followed
for
the
plough
three
for
the
pot
of
money
and
three
for
the
bone
after
this
bart
arose
with
his
in
which
he
had
been
diligently
scribbling
gentlemen
said
he
after
the
able
polished
elegant
eloquent
ornate
and
thoroughly
exhaustive
address
from
my
learned
friend
who
has
just
sat
down
it
would
be
quite
out
of
my
power
to
say
anything
besides
i
m
appointed
to
give
the
poem
the
subject
is
connected
with
one
of
the
articles
before
us
i
mean
the
bone
porter
has
one
theory
simmons
another
my
learned
friend
has
a
third
for
my
part
i
have
my
own
theory
which
i
adopted
at
the
moment
of
its
discovery
and
which
i
still
maintain
this
gentlemen
is
the
subject
of
my
after
which
bart
read
the
following
from
his
the
true
theory
of
the
bone
o
i
m
the
bone
of
a
parley
yoo
that
settled
in
minas
bay
that
dammed
the
marshes
and
cleared
the
woods
and
called
the
place
grand
pré
and
the
grain
it
riz
and
the
settlement
growed
and
werry
content
were
we
with
our
cattle
and
pigs
and
bosses
and
gigs
and
beautiful
scenerie
and
there
it
was
nothing
but
et
cetera
from
morning
to
night
and
mercy
madame
and
wee
we
were
all
so
werry
polite
but
the
britishers
came
and
druv
us
off
so
i
took
to
my
heels
and
ran
and
one
of
them
chased
me
and
quick
i
went
for
rather
an
elderly
man
and
he
had
a
gun
and
i
had
none
and
he
fired
that
gun
at
me
and
he
shot
my
leg
and
off
it
dropped
which
was
rather
a
bother
you
see
but
i
seized
my
leg
and
i
hopped
away
as
quick
as
quick
could
be
and
the
britisher
loaded
his
gun
agin
for
another
shot
at
me
but
i
dodged
the
britisher
in
the
woods
and
took
the
leg
that
was
shot
and
buried
it
under
the
apple
tree
in
this
werry
identical
spot
and
i
m
the
werry
identical
bone
of
the
leg
of
the
parley
yoo
that
was
buried
beneath
the
apple
tree
and
dug
up
again
by
you
this
closed
the
proceedings
a
procession
was
then
formed
headed
by
the
b
who
led
the
way
to
the
museum
there
they
deposited
the
exhumed
acadian
relics
and
if
they
haven
t
been
taken
away
they
re
lying
there
still
xxii
boys
in
the
the
doctor
s
the
a
journey
to
the
the
captain
the
presence
of
porter
in
the
museum
repressed
to
some
extent
the
merriment
of
the
boys
and
the
articles
were
deposited
in
a
conspicuous
place
where
they
could
not
fail
to
attract
attention
the
museum
had
grown
up
slowly
under
the
joint
care
of
the
doctor
and
simmons
the
former
of
whom
devoted
himself
to
the
archæological
and
the
latter
to
the
mineralogical
department
with
each
of
these
gentlemen
it
was
a
hobby
the
delight
of
the
doctor
at
these
exhumed
french
relics
has
already
been
described
and
at
the
present
time
their
formal
assignment
to
their
proper
location
here
served
to
stimulate
his
enthusiasm
and
started
him
off
upon
a
favorite
theme
of
his
the
exiled
acadians
about
these
he
had
much
to
say
he
showed
all
the
relics
which
he
had
slowly
accumulated
here
he
told
many
stories
of
discoveries
of
his
own
and
finally
going
to
a
small
chest
he
drew
forth
some
papers
i
promised
to
show
you
some
of
these
said
he
when
we
were
over
on
the
north
mountain
everything
in
the
banishment
of
the
acadians
was
hard
and
harsh
and
can
not
be
thought
of
now
without
indignation
not
the
least
repulsive
thing
about
this
business
is
the
way
in
which
they
were
sent
off
many
people
suppose
that
they
were
sent
away
in
the
large
ships
of
the
british
fleet
that
was
not
the
case
they
were
packed
in
a
number
of
small
vessels
hired
at
boston
most
of
them
were
schooners
the
whole
thing
was
taken
under
contract
by
a
boston
firm
hancock
all
their
bills
which
they
sent
in
to
the
nova
scotia
government
are
now
in
the
archives
and
i
have
copies
of
them
see
here
is
one
for
a
and
he
showed
the
following
which
the
boys
passed
from
hand
to
hand
illustration
illustration
ah
boys
said
the
doctor
mournfully
how
much
of
human
anguish
may
we
read
there
how
many
broken
hearts
how
much
despair
appears
before
us
in
those
remorseless
figures
think
of
the
name
of
hancock
being
associated
with
a
thing
like
that
neutralls
they
were
two
hundred
and
thirty
neutralls
at
so
much
per
head
perhaps
among
those
poor
exiles
contracted
for
at
so
much
per
head
by
that
boston
firm
there
was
some
evangeline
looking
over
the
sea
with
her
white
lips
and
her
eyes
of
despair
still
continued
the
doctor
after
some
silence
the
english
didn
t
have
it
all
their
own
way
there
were
several
occasions
in
which
the
were
able
to
baffle
them
one
place
was
at
the
head
of
the
bay
of
fundy
the
river
pelilcodiac
here
the
french
were
in
league
with
the
indians
as
indeed
they
were
throughout
the
whole
of
canada
and
acadie
and
when
a
detachment
of
troops
was
sent
there
to
capture
them
they
retreated
to
the
woods
the
troops
made
a
descent
at
one
place
where
they
found
women
and
children
these
they
were
merciless
enough
to
make
prisoners
then
they
went
through
the
country
devastating
it
and
seeking
thus
to
ruin
the
poor
fugitives
it
was
villanous
work
they
burned
more
than
two
hundred
and
fifty
houses
and
a
church
at
last
the
french
made
an
attack
on
them
and
they
were
forced
to
retreat
had
the
french
shown
a
little
more
enterprise
they
could
have
destroyed
them
as
it
was
the
troops
got
off
without
much
loss
there
was
another
instance
when
the
french
got
the
better
of
their
enemies
it
was
a
vessel
that
was
carrying
over
two
hundred
of
them
from
annapolis
to
carolina
the
french
rose
and
got
command
of
the
vessel
and
put
into
the
river
john
the
english
heard
of
it
and
sent
a
vessel
after
them
with
british
soldiers
disguised
as
french
but
the
fugitives
discovered
the
trick
and
not
being
able
to
cope
with
their
enemies
they
set
fire
to
the
vessel
and
escaped
to
the
woods
there
was
a
great
deal
of
abominable
cruelty
in
different
parts
wherever
they
could
not
make
prisoners
they
burned
their
houses
in
the
hope
of
starving
them
to
death
whole
districts
were
thus
devastated
the
descendants
of
these
peopie
remember
all
this
yet
and
can
tell
many
a
tale
of
misery
many
of
the
exiles
gradually
worked
their
way
back
and
found
new
homes
for
themselves
in
other
parts
of
the
country
and
their
descendants
are
scattered
all
about
the
coasts
of
nova
scotia
and
new
brunswick
they
are
curiously
like
their
ancestors
simple
innocent
joyous
peaceful
there
is
but
little
crime
among
them
and
though
they
are
not
so
progressive
as
we
are
yet
they
have
other
qualities
which
may
compensate
for
the
absence
of
our
more
practical
faculties
they
are
certainly
very
stationary
so
much
so
indeed
that
some
acute
observers
declare
that
they
have
not
advanced
so
much
as
their
kindred
in
france
they
say
that
our
are
more
like
the
french
peasantry
of
a
hundred
years
ago
than
the
french
themselves
are
at
the
present
day
this
is
particularly
the
case
in
the
more
remote
districts
such
as
the
bay
de
chaleur
i
have
often
been
there
myself
and
every
time
i
visit
one
of
their
villages
in
that
district
i
recall
some
of
the
descriptions
of
the
grand
pré
acadians
in
longfellow
s
here
the
doctor
began
to
tell
some
anecdotes
and
then
went
on
speaking
of
other
things
until
at
length
he
stopped
in
front
of
a
rusty
cannonball
which
lay
on
a
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
here
said
he
is
something
which
i
received
a
few
days
ago
and
i
think
it
is
almost
equal
to
the
acadian
what
is
it
it
s
a
from
louisbourg
and
though
i
don
t
know
of
course
for
certain
yet
i
have
made
up
my
mind
that
it
is
a
relic
of
the
first
how
can
you
tell
sir
asked
bruce
whether
it
is
the
first
siege
or
the
o
for
that
matter
i
can
t
tell
at
all
very
clearly
only
the
spot
where
this
was
found
makes
it
more
likely
to
have
been
fired
at
the
first
than
the
second
besides
the
first
siege
is
far
more
interesting
to
us
since
it
was
the
act
of
british
provincials
and
an
exploit
quite
unparalleled
in
its
why
sir
i
always
thought
that
the
second
siege
was
one
of
the
greatest
achievements
in
war
were
there
any
generals
in
the
first
equal
to
wolfe
or
any
other
men
equal
to
boscawen
and
rodney
and
amherst
i
m
glad
you
put
it
in
that
way
replied
the
doctor
no
in
the
first
expedition
there
are
no
names
so
brilliant
as
these
pepperell
was
a
merchant
and
a
colonel
in
the
militia
whether
that
makes
his
exploit
the
more
glorious
or
not
i
leave
you
to
judge
but
this
much
is
true
that
about
the
first
siege
there
was
a
reckless
dash
and
gallantry
and
romantic
heroism
which
we
can
not
find
in
the
second
mind
you
it
was
all
the
work
of
a
lot
of
farmers
fresh
from
the
plough
raw
militia
and
how
they
could
get
such
a
plan
into
their
heads
i
can
not
imagine
i
have
often
thought
that
it
was
their
very
ignorance
that
emboldened
them
it
was
principally
the
work
of
massachusetts
though
the
other
new
england
provinces
took
some
share
in
it
the
idea
was
started
there
and
the
governor
took
it
up
very
earnestly
so
they
raised
four
thousand
men
and
a
fleet
of
thirteen
vessels
which
was
a
wonderful
thing
to
be
done
by
so
thinly
peopled
and
so
young
a
community
at
first
they
intended
to
have
the
cooperation
of
the
british
fleet
but
the
commodore
declined
and
it
was
only
after
he
had
sailed
to
boston
under
orders
from
the
british
government
and
found
the
new
england
expedition
gone
that
he
followed
them
and
so
took
part
in
it
for
governor
shirley
and
the
new
england
militiamen
resolved
to
go
on
whether
the
commodore
helped
them
or
not
and
so
they
did
go
on
but
it
was
all
right
in
the
end
for
the
british
fleet
came
up
with
them
and
they
went
on
in
company
to
their
destination
they
landed
at
gabarus
bay
south
of
and
behind
the
town
it
was
the
thirtieth
of
april
very
early
in
the
season
cold
and
foggy
the
french
were
there
already
to
dispute
the
landing
but
they
outwitted
them
most
dexterously
it
was
cold
and
boisterous
and
foggy
as
i
have
said
and
never
did
any
men
have
harder
work
in
getting
their
arms
and
stores
on
shore
but
all
this
was
accomplished
at
last
the
next
day
major
vaughn
with
four
hundred
men
went
past
the
city
up
to
the
harbor
and
set
on
fire
some
warehouses
they
made
a
great
smoke
and
the
soldiers
in
the
royal
battery
one
of
the
chief
works
spiked
the
guns
and
fled
in
a
panic
on
the
following
day
vaughn
with
thirteen
men
came
near
the
fort
and
as
it
seemed
to
be
deserted
they
advanced
cautiously
and
finally
entered
it
they
hadn
t
any
flag
so
one
of
the
soldiers
climbed
the
with
his
red
coat
in
his
teeth
and
nailed
this
to
the
staff
as
a
flag
vaughn
then
sent
word
to
general
pepperell
may
it
please
your
honor
to
be
informed
that
by
the
grace
of
god
and
the
courage
of
thirteen
men
i
entered
the
royal
battery
about
nine
o
clock
and
am
waiting
for
but
before
reenforcements
could
come
the
french
at
louisbourg
had
seen
them
and
sent
a
hundred
men
in
boats
to
regain
possession
vaughn
and
his
men
however
were
ready
for
them
and
the
little
band
gave
them
so
warm
a
reception
that
they
actually
drove
them
back
and
held
possession
till
reënforcements
came
then
the
royal
battery
s
guns
were
remounted
some
new
ones
brought
and
all
these
were
turned
upon
the
city
and
this
battery
did
not
a
little
towards
the
final
capture
it
strikes
me
that
this
was
an
uncommonly
plucky
thing
to
do
continued
the
doctor
and
this
incident
is
but
one
among
many
the
whole
siege
is
full
of
such
exploits
the
character
of
the
besieging
army
was
odd
in
the
extreme
the
lads
worked
like
oxen
at
their
duties
toiling
away
in
the
surf
and
in
the
swamp
and
in
the
woods
and
yet
at
the
same
time
presenting
an
appearance
of
disorder
that
was
shocking
to
the
martinets
who
were
present
in
front
they
fought
like
tigers
but
in
the
rear
each
man
did
what
seemed
right
in
his
own
eyes
in
front
there
was
bombarding
in
the
rear
frolicking
racing
wrestling
and
pitching
quoits
running
after
the
shot
from
the
fortress
so
as
to
get
the
bounty
that
was
offered
these
honest
lads
knew
nothing
at
all
about
engineering
or
regular
approaches
the
engineers
who
were
present
spoke
of
parallels
and
zigzags
but
the
militiamen
laughed
at
what
they
called
their
outlandish
gibberish
and
made
their
approaches
to
the
enemy
in
their
own
homespun
way
how
do
you
think
they
contrived
to
do
it
why
by
making
a
bold
advance
by
night
and
throwing
up
an
earthwork
and
intrenching
themselves
before
morning
in
this
way
they
continued
their
advance
to
the
utter
confusion
of
the
professional
engineers
the
fact
is
the
audacity
of
pure
courage
meets
with
astonishing
successes
audace
l
audace
toujours
l
is
a
french
saying
which
was
exemplified
before
the
eyes
of
frenchmen
throughout
all
this
first
siege
the
commandant
at
louisbourg
thought
there
was
an
army
of
thirteen
thousand
men
besieging
him
and
all
the
time
the
army
amounted
to
less
than
four
thousand
farmers
and
so
the
men
carried
on
their
siege
with
their
valor
and
their
laughter
their
heroism
and
their
sport
their
sufferings
and
their
mirth
fighting
in
front
frolicking
in
the
rear
enjoying
life
like
boys
but
facing
death
like
men
and
that
was
the
way
they
took
louisbourg
when
the
gallant
fellows
marched
into
the
stronghold
which
they
had
captured
then
first
they
seemed
to
have
an
adequate
idea
of
their
undertaking
they
looked
around
upon
the
formidable
batteries
the
granite
walls
the
intricate
and
the
mighty
ramparts
and
were
half
appalled
at
the
immensity
of
their
success
and
indeed
the
success
may
well
be
called
immense
it
was
a
wonderful
thing
when
we
think
who
it
was
that
achieved
it
the
success
is
all
the
more
striking
when
we
consider
the
vast
preparations
that
were
made
for
the
second
siege
that
second
siege
does
not
seem
to
me
to
be
at
all
equal
to
the
first
in
point
of
romantic
interest
and
then
again
the
fact
that
there
was
a
second
siege
is
of
itself
stigma
on
the
british
government
for
so
readily
giving
back
to
the
french
what
had
been
so
gallantly
won
the
blood
of
those
brave
fellows
had
all
been
shed
in
vain
the
work
had
all
to
be
done
over
again
and
more
blood
had
to
be
shed
before
that
mistake
could
be
rectified
but
when
that
mistake
was
rectified
and
louisbourg
was
taken
a
second
time
there
was
a
very
different
minister
at
the
head
of
affairs
the
struggle
with
the
french
was
begun
on
a
gigantic
scale
and
did
not
end
until
the
french
power
on
this
continent
had
been
crushed
under
the
ruins
of
with
these
words
the
doctor
ended
his
remarks
and
as
it
was
now
late
the
boys
all
retired
to
their
respective
rooms
where
they
passed
the
remainder
of
the
evening
in
study
it
usually
takes
several
days
for
boys
to
settle
down
fairly
to
school
work
at
the
beginning
of
any
new
term
and
so
after
this
vacation
it
was
some
time
before
the
school
work
could
be
fairly
grappled
with
the
remembrance
of
the
events
of
the
past
days
was
strong
in
the
minds
of
all
and
for
a
time
prevented
that
application
which
was
desirable
a
stronger
effort
than
usual
was
required
in
order
to
force
the
mind
to
its
task
and
a
longer
time
was
needed
in
order
to
master
that
task
on
the
third
day
after
the
school
had
recommenced
the
boys
of
the
were
discussing
the
important
question
of
the
disposal
of
their
time
for
that
afternoon
school
was
already
over
the
other
boys
had
scattered
in
different
directions
some
to
the
dike
lands
some
to
the
fields
and
some
to
the
woods
where
shall
we
go
boys
asked
bart
to
the
woods
said
phil
to
gaspereaux
said
arthur
a
game
of
cricket
said
tom
no
boys
said
bruce
let
s
go
down
and
see
what
s
become
of
the
old
that
s
the
idea
said
bart
the
glorious
old
antelope
let
s
have
one
last
look
at
her
by
this
time
perhaps
she
is
half
covered
with
mud
it
was
a
soft
place
i
think
where
she
was
lying
and
she
will
soon
be
buried
out
of
sight
so
let
s
have
one
final
look
at
her
before
we
lose
sight
of
her
this
proposal
was
in
the
highest
degree
satisfactory
to
the
other
boys
and
soon
they
started
down
the
road
to
the
place
where
the
antelope
lay
on
reaching
the
place
they
found
that
it
was
high
tide
and
the
schooner
lay
in
the
same
place
where
they
had
seen
her
last
far
over
on
her
side
with
her
masts
pointing
downward
the
tide
had
risen
so
high
that
it
covered
more
than
half
of
her
leaving
only
part
visible
the
upper
parts
of
her
masts
also
were
covered
at
such
a
melancholy
spectacle
the
boys
stood
for
some
time
in
solemn
silence
another
schooner
lay
not
far
away
at
a
wharf
but
they
felt
no
curiosity
about
her
all
their
thoughts
were
taken
up
with
the
antelope
and
so
this
is
the
end
of
her
said
bruce
solemnly
as
captain
corbet
said
remarked
phil
who
would
have
thought
that
her
end
was
so
near
said
arthur
and
think
said
tom
of
the
old
craft
after
escaping
so
many
perils
meeting
her
fate
here
at
her
own
it
s
the
old
saying
realized
said
bart
the
sailor
shipwrecked
within
sight
of
but
i
say
bart
she
doesn
t
seem
to
have
sunk
any
deeper
in
the
mud
does
she
said
bruce
no
said
bart
i
expected
by
this
time
that
she
would
be
as
deep
as
that
in
mud
not
in
she
s
afloat
said
tom
no
she
isn
t
she
doesn
t
move
said
bruce
no
she
s
perfectly
steady
and
fixed
in
the
mud
said
bart
there
s
no
floating
about
she
ll
break
up
soon
i
suppose
said
phil
o
i
don
t
know
said
bart
if
she
were
exposed
to
a
heavy
sea
she
would
but
here
in
this
quiet
harbor
she
will
either
sink
altogether
in
the
mud
or
else
lie
rotting
away
for
years
a
mournful
and
melancholy
while
the
boys
were
looking
thus
sadly
upon
the
schooner
a
man
emerged
from
the
cabin
of
the
other
vessel
at
the
wharf
and
going
ashore
proceeded
as
though
on
his
way
to
the
village
the
boys
did
not
notice
this
man
till
he
was
close
to
them
and
then
there
was
a
shout
of
joyful
recognition
captain
pratt
yes
that
stout
bluff
jovial
captain
stood
there
before
their
eyes
evincing
as
much
pleasure
at
the
sight
of
them
as
they
did
at
the
sight
of
him
he
wrung
their
hands
heartily
all
round
laughing
all
the
time
and
asking
them
how
they
got
home
and
whether
they
ran
ashore
more
than
a
dozen
times
in
doing
so
i
come
here
said
he
arter
taters
i
got
a
tater
freight
to
boston
and
i
m
goin
to
fill
up
right
straight
off
and
it
s
right
glad
i
am
to
see
you
all
again
i
thought
mebbe
i
d
see
some
of
you
over
here
and
come
here
instead
of
goin
to
another
place
where
i
could
have
got
a
better
the
captain
was
very
voluble
very
noisy
and
very
jolly
he
made
all
the
boys
come
on
board
his
vessel
and
give
an
account
of
their
adventures
after
leaving
him
they
did
so
and
he
listened
with
deep
attention
varied
from
time
to
time
by
peals
of
laughter
wal
boys
said
he
at
last
i
m
a
goin
right
straight
off
to
boston
as
soon
as
i
get
my
cargo
in
ain
t
there
any
of
you
that
wants
to
go
i
ll
take
any
of
you
or
all
of
you
come
the
boys
thanked
him
but
excused
themselves
and
explained
that
they
couldn
t
go
very
easily
as
the
school
had
now
begun
and
they
were
all
hard
at
work
at
their
studies
sorry
for
that
said
captain
pratt
i
m
too
late
i
see
perhaps
i
ll
have
another
chance
with
you
at
any
rate
i
ll
promise
you
a
better
vessel
than
the
one
you
had
on
your
cruise
of
all
the
old
tubs
but
where
is
she
now
has
corbet
got
a
tater
freight
at
this
question
the
boys
said
nothing
but
looked
silently
and
with
melancholy
glances
over
the
stern
to
where
the
form
of
the
antelope
was
half
visible
above
the
water
captain
pratt
saw
their
glances
what
craft
s
that
there
he
asked
that
said
bart
is
the
gallant
craft
that
you
just
asked
about
the
one
that
we
had
in
our
cruise
the
that
cried
captain
pratt
and
starting
up
he
walked
astern
and
took
a
long
look
at
the
schooner
the
boys
followed
him
they
said
nothing
but
looked
at
the
antelope
along
with
captain
pratt
xxiii
of
the
captain
pratt
to
the
his
engines
and
his
up
she
rises
who
ll
go
for
captain
corbet
captain
pratt
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
wal
said
he
at
last
whar
s
corbet
he
s
home
why
don
t
he
do
something
why
what
can
he
do
do
he
says
the
schooner
s
lost
did
he
say
so
himself
he
said
the
schooner
was
a
gone
those
were
his
own
and
didn
t
he
try
to
do
anything
what
didn
t
even
try
wal
i
declare
i
never
did
think
that
corbet
had
much
brains
but
this
beats
everything
to
go
and
let
his
schooner
go
to
destruction
in
this
way
and
not
even
try
to
save
her
is
a
little
beyond
what
i
expected
even
of
but
how
did
it
happen
the
boys
told
him
and
so
said
captain
pratt
he
came
here
next
day
and
found
the
schooner
lying
here
and
did
nothing
jest
sot
down
and
lamented
over
her
why
what
s
the
man
made
of
he
s
about
the
only
man
i
ever
heard
of
that
could
sit
still
and
see
his
property
but
all
the
people
in
the
village
thought
it
was
of
course
if
he
said
so
they
believed
him
if
he
did
nothing
why
should
they
try
to
do
anything
if
a
man
won
t
help
himself
you
don
t
suppose
other
people
s
goin
to
help
him
do
you
and
do
you
think
after
all
that
she
could
have
been
saved
course
she
and
she
wasn
t
lost
course
she
wasn
could
she
be
saved
now
course
she
what
and
she
isn
t
lost
after
all
course
she
isn
at
this
astounding
intelligence
the
boys
looked
at
one
another
in
silent
amazement
why
look
here
said
captain
pratt
what
happened
to
that
there
schooner
often
happens
to
others
it
s
a
mighty
unpleasant
thing
to
happen
but
schooners
do
get
over
it
after
all
i
ve
helped
friends
out
of
similar
scrapes
and
have
sot
several
schooners
right
side
up
in
worse
places
than
there
s
nothing
so
very
bad
about
this
the
position
is
a
good
one
for
working
in
too
and
the
mud
here
isn
t
so
soft
as
it
is
in
other
places
around
here
by
a
long
chalk
but
whatever
got
into
corbet
s
head
i
can
t
imagine
it
beats
can
you
really
save
her
then
after
all
you
yourself
course
i
can
only
not
i
d
want
some
and
you
course
i
will
with
the
above
proviso
captain
pratt
s
a
man
that
s
always
ready
to
help
a
neighbor
and
though
this
here
neighbor
doesn
t
seem
altogether
inclined
to
help
himself
yet
i
m
ready
to
do
what
i
at
the
generous
offer
of
captain
pratt
the
joy
of
the
boys
was
inexpressible
they
at
once
poured
forth
a
torrent
of
questions
as
to
when
he
could
begin
his
work
and
where
and
how
and
what
they
could
do
to
help
him
and
whether
they
could
do
anything
at
all
which
questions
being
all
asked
at
once
could
not
be
immediately
answered
you
see
boys
said
captain
pratt
i
ll
need
some
we
ll
do
what
we
that
s
right
i
ll
have
to
rely
on
you
i
ve
only
got
two
men
in
the
schooner
and
we
can
t
do
all
if
you
know
any
men
about
the
village
send
them
or
bring
them
along
send
for
corbet
o
we
want
to
have
it
all
done
without
captain
corbet
knowing
anything
about
it
till
it
s
all
why
not
let
him
come
and
take
his
share
in
the
work
o
it
would
be
better
fun
to
get
him
down
here
and
let
him
see
his
vessel
fun
you
call
it
wal
i
won
t
dispute
about
words
at
any
rate
it
ought
to
teach
him
a
but
when
can
we
begin
now
now
replied
captain
pratt
with
a
smile
wal
hardly
not
just
now
i
should
say
you
see
the
vessel
s
partly
in
the
mud
and
a
good
deal
in
the
water
and
it
would
be
rather
difficult
to
get
at
her
so
as
to
go
to
how
long
will
it
be
before
we
can
begin
not
till
the
tide
leaves
that
will
be
after
yes
this
evening
but
morning
the
tide
will
be
out
and
everything
can
be
done
but
then
we
shall
be
in
so
you
will
well
it
ll
have
to
be
managed
without
you
but
after
all
you
won
t
be
wanted
till
the
evening
my
men
and
i
can
do
all
the
fixins
we
ll
get
everything
ready
when
the
tide
is
out
and
then
in
the
evening
when
you
come
you
will
be
able
to
help
without
getting
up
to
your
eyes
in
o
well
we
ll
all
be
how
many
can
you
muster
a
dozen
boys
like
you
will
be
o
we
can
muster
more
than
that
if
you
wish
it
we
will
bring
down
the
whole
all
right
then
you
see
it
will
be
about
eight
men
s
work
i
and
my
men
make
three
and
you
lads
ought
to
make
up
the
rest
it
ll
be
mostly
pullin
that
you
ll
be
wanted
pulling
yes
histin
i
ll
rig
some
tackle
for
you
besides
i
ll
have
to
get
the
vessel
clear
of
mud
at
low
tide
there
can
t
be
much
in
her
why
we
thought
from
what
captain
corbet
said
that
by
this
time
she
would
be
sunk
so
deep
that
she
would
be
half
buried
in
the
mud
and
half
full
of
nonsense
the
mud
just
here
on
this
slope
isn
t
very
deep
six
or
eight
inches
of
mud
is
about
all
she
d
sink
in
two
or
three
hours
work
will
clear
all
that
away
and
then
all
that
is
left
for
us
to
do
is
to
get
her
right
side
up
and
i
ll
rig
the
tackle
for
i
must
say
captain
pratt
said
bart
it
s
un
commonly
good
in
you
to
take
so
much
time
and
o
as
for
that
said
captain
pratt
neighbors
must
be
neighborly
and
seafarin
men
most
so
besides
i
hain
t
got
anything
in
particular
to
do
and
i
d
like
very
well
to
turn
a
hand
to
this
but
i
don
t
see
yet
why
corbet
should
go
and
be
such
a
precious
old
goose
the
vessel
ain
t
worth
much
but
she
s
worth
settin
right
side
up
that
i
ll
the
captain
then
proceeded
to
explain
his
plan
of
action
to
the
boys
more
minutely
so
that
at
last
they
perceived
how
very
simple
and
feasible
it
was
and
wondered
now
that
captain
corbet
should
have
given
up
his
vessel
so
readily
without
making
any
effort
where
an
effort
would
have
been
so
very
easy
i
understand
now
i
think
said
bart
why
captain
corbet
gave
up
the
vessel
it
was
the
babby
he
wanted
to
be
able
to
devote
himself
altogether
to
his
domestic
after
spending
some
further
time
the
boys
took
their
departure
with
the
understanding
that
they
were
to
return
on
the
following
day
after
school
with
all
the
boys
that
they
could
muster
by
seven
o
clock
on
the
following
morning
captain
pratt
was
at
work
at
the
antelope
the
tide
had
retreated
far
enough
to
allow
of
an
investigation
of
her
condition
though
the
water
which
had
filled
her
at
the
last
tide
had
not
run
out
of
her
his
first
work
was
to
bore
a
few
auger
holes
along
the
lower
part
of
her
deck
to
let
all
the
water
run
out
the
antelope
was
not
after
all
so
very
deep
in
the
mud
as
had
been
supposed
by
the
boys
it
had
covered
her
taffrail
some
inches
but
this
could
be
shovelled
away
without
any
very
severe
exertion
and
it
was
to
this
that
captain
pratt
and
his
men
first
directed
their
energies
two
hours
work
sufficed
for
them
to
clear
away
all
this
after
which
they
turned
their
attention
to
other
things
first
of
all
as
the
water
had
now
run
out
captain
pratt
stopped
up
the
auger
holes
tightly
and
then
prepared
to
close
the
hatchways
this
was
a
work
of
extreme
difficulty
the
hatches
which
belonged
to
the
schooner
had
floated
away
long
ago
and
it
was
necessary
to
make
new
ones
this
was
at
length
done
by
working
up
some
stuff
that
was
on
board
captain
pratt
s
vessel
which
they
then
proceeded
to
fasten
to
the
hatchways
of
the
antelope
the
position
in
which
the
schooner
lay
made
it
excessively
difficult
she
was
on
her
side
on
a
slope
in
such
a
way
that
her
deck
overhung
them
somewhat
as
they
worked
so
that
they
labored
at
a
great
disadvantage
however
they
persevered
and
at
length
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
that
the
new
hatches
were
fastened
in
with
sufficient
firmness
to
suit
their
purposes
and
were
judged
to
be
sufficiently
for
the
present
emergency
the
work
thus
far
important
though
it
was
had
been
essentially
preliminary
and
now
the
machinery
had
to
be
arranged
for
the
immediate
work
of
raising
the
fallen
vessel
to
her
proper
position
captain
pratt
and
his
men
took
a
number
of
spars
from
their
schooner
and
selecting
three
of
them
bound
their
ends
together
and
stood
these
three
like
a
tripod
as
near
to
the
schooner
as
possible
and
close
by
the
foremast
three
more
bound
together
in
a
similar
way
were
placed
near
the
mainmast
from
the
top
of
each
of
these
a
was
suspended
and
a
line
also
was
passed
from
each
and
run
around
a
tree
which
stood
about
a
dozen
yards
away
from
the
edge
of
the
bank
another
line
passed
from
each
and
was
fastened
around
each
mast
of
the
schooner
captain
pratt
s
design
was
now
evident
first
of
all
he
had
cleared
away
the
mud
that
had
covered
the
taffrail
of
the
schooner
and
emptied
her
of
water
then
he
had
battened
down
the
hatches
so
that
at
the
next
rising
tide
no
water
should
enter
her
and
finally
he
had
rigged
the
so
as
to
hoist
up
the
schooner
to
an
erect
position
by
means
of
the
united
efforts
of
all
that
could
be
mustered
but
the
schooner
as
she
now
lay
could
not
be
raised
by
such
means
it
was
necessary
to
have
additional
help
and
that
help
was
to
be
found
in
the
rising
tide
when
the
water
should
rise
so
as
to
be
deep
enough
for
the
schooner
to
float
in
the
task
of
pulling
her
up
to
an
erect
position
would
be
comparatively
easy
captain
pratt
s
labors
were
energetically
performed
and
finally
just
as
he
had
completed
his
tackle
arrangements
the
tide
began
to
flow
around
the
schooner
in
another
hour
the
water
was
high
around
her
still
another
and
the
tide
was
at
its
fullest
height
and
captain
pratt
began
to
look
anxiously
for
the
boys
meanwhile
the
boys
on
the
hill
had
all
heard
of
the
proposed
enterprise
and
from
the
largest
to
the
smallest
were
filled
with
intense
excitement
they
chafed
impatiently
against
the
restraints
of
the
school
and
waited
with
extreme
difficulty
for
the
closing
hour
at
last
it
came
and
then
with
loud
shouts
and
screams
and
laughter
the
whole
school
set
off
at
a
run
for
the
scene
of
action
which
they
reached
just
as
captain
pratt
began
to
feel
impatient
hooray
shouted
the
gallant
captain
as
he
saw
them
pouring
down
towards
the
wharf
here
you
are
and
lots
of
you
too
you
re
just
in
time
too
the
tide
s
up
the
tackle
is
rigged
and
all
we
ve
got
to
do
now
is
to
go
to
the
boys
looked
hastily
around
and
though
they
could
not
see
all
that
had
been
done
yet
they
could
comprehend
the
purpose
of
the
tackle
which
they
saw
before
them
and
had
no
doubt
whatever
that
the
undertaking
would
be
perfectly
successful
now
boys
said
captain
pratt
you
can
t
all
bear
a
hand
but
you
small
boys
ll
have
to
be
satisfied
with
lookin
on
i
ll
choose
the
biggest
to
help
me
and
show
you
where
you
ve
got
to
saying
this
he
selected
from
among
the
boys
bruce
arthur
bart
tom
phil
jiggins
muckle
sammy
ram
ram
johnny
blue
billymack
bogud
and
pat
and
these
he
stationed
at
the
tackle
which
was
attached
to
the
foremast
while
he
himself
and
his
two
men
went
to
the
lines
which
were
attached
to
the
mainmast
now
boys
said
he
it
s
no
use
to
pull
every
which
way
pull
together
as
i
give
the
word
mind
it
s
a
long
pull
a
strong
pull
and
a
pull
all
together
i
ll
sing
and
you
pull
at
the
chorus
s
the
saying
this
captain
pratt
burst
forth
with
a
rude
song
which
was
up
she
rises
hi
ho
cheerly
men
heave
her
up
hi
ho
cheerly
men
all
together
hi
ho
cheerly
men
heave
with
a
will
hi
ho
cheerly
men
and
at
every
cry
hi
ho
cheerly
men
captain
pratt
and
his
men
gave
a
pull
and
the
boys
watching
him
pulled
also
at
first
they
were
a
little
irregular
but
they
soon
caught
the
time
and
pulled
as
regularly
as
the
men
and
thus
with
a
long
pull
and
a
strong
pull
and
a
pull
all
together
they
sought
to
raise
up
the
fallen
schooner
the
schooner
felt
it
already
the
mud
had
been
detached
from
its
grasp
and
the
water
which
flowed
around
formed
an
additional
assistant
buoying
it
up
and
supporting
it
as
they
pulled
the
clinging
mud
was
the
only
thing
to
contend
with
the
first
pull
loosened
its
hold
somewhat
the
second
and
third
did
this
still
more
and
finally
the
fourth
raised
the
masts
above
the
surface
of
the
water
again
and
again
they
pulled
and
higher
and
higher
came
the
masts
until
at
last
when
high
up
in
the
air
all
further
pulling
was
rendered
unnecessary
by
the
schooner
which
threw
herself
upon
her
keel
in
the
water
and
thus
righted
herself
of
her
own
accord
she
did
not
sit
very
fair
it
is
true
for
the
mud
which
had
accumulated
on
one
side
of
her
hold
gave
her
a
appearance
but
that
mattered
little
to
the
boys
it
was
enough
triumph
to
them
that
she
was
afloat
and
so
they
celebrated
their
triumph
in
long
loud
cheers
having
thus
righted
the
schooner
captain
pratt
prepared
to
secure
her
in
a
proper
manner
we
ve
righted
her
boys
said
he
and
now
let
s
take
care
that
she
shan
t
be
with
this
end
in
view
lines
were
fastened
from
the
schooner
to
the
shore
and
captain
pratt
finally
pronounced
her
free
from
danger
the
boys
now
crowded
around
the
antelope
to
see
what
marks
she
bore
of
her
late
calamities
there
she
floated
before
them
her
masts
and
rigging
plastered
with
mud
yet
afloat
and
able
once
more
to
plough
the
seas
after
her
own
fashion
a
few
among
them
managed
to
scramble
on
board
the
righted
schooner
the
scene
around
was
not
particularly
attractive
the
mud
still
clung
close
to
the
deck
and
rigging
and
even
captain
pratt
s
work
around
the
hatches
was
already
coated
over
with
thick
slime
the
scene
was
not
an
attractive
one
and
they
did
not
remain
there
long
she
wants
cleanin
remarked
captain
pratt
after
a
long
survey
that
s
a
fact
an
what
s
more
she
wants
corkin
no
doubt
an
a
good
coat
o
tar
she
wants
new
spars
an
riggin
an
chains
an
anchors
a
new
deck
too
and
pumps
wouldn
t
be
out
of
the
way
and
for
that
matter
while
they
were
about
it
they
might
as
well
put
a
new
hull
onto
her
by
that
time
she
d
be
fit
to
carry
taters
and
corbet
might
make
a
little
money
out
of
her
but
it
would
cost
a
good
bit
to
do
all
that
and
so
i
dar
say
corbet
ll
sail
her
as
she
stands
if
he
sails
her
at
all
arter
all
he
might
as
well
bein
as
she
s
jest
as
good
now
as
ever
she
was
she
never
was
much
but
then
she
s
been
lucky
and
did
well
enough
for
corbet
it
would
be
kind
of
onnateral
to
see
him
aboard
of
any
other
craft
than
this
boys
said
bart
something
ought
to
be
done
in
honor
of
this
great
occasion
and
above
all
we
ought
to
make
up
some
way
to
bring
corbet
face
to
face
with
his
restored
antelope
shall
we
tell
him
at
once
and
let
him
come
down
no
let
s
leave
it
till
he
finds
out
let
s
give
him
a
shock
of
but
how
will
we
know
anything
about
his
surprise
unless
we
are
here
on
the
spot
at
that
great
meeting
between
corbet
and
his
lost
but
restored
schooner
o
we
ll
have
to
manage
it
so
as
to
be
here
when
he
comes
down
to
see
we
ought
to
arrange
some
shall
we
let
him
know
what
has
happened
or
get
him
to
come
down
here
for
something
else
o
we
ought
to
get
him
to
come
for
something
else
and
then
his
surprise
will
be
all
the
but
what
else
that
we
ll
have
to
think
we
ought
to
make
haste
about
it
yes
we
ought
to
decide
before
the
end
of
the
the
end
of
the
week
nonsense
why
not
of
course
now
s
the
time
we
must
get
him
down
while
we
re
all
here
if
we
don
t
he
ll
be
certain
to
hear
all
about
it
before
tomorrow
from
some
one
yes
of
s
the
yes
we
re
all
here
i
want
to
see
the
meeting
i
wouldn
t
lose
the
sight
for
well
what
shall
we
get
up
to
bring
him
here
o
let
s
send
word
that
captain
pratt
wants
to
see
him
on
very
particular
that
won
t
bring
him
especially
if
he
s
got
the
babby
he
wouldn
t
come
down
before
when
the
business
was
still
more
we
couldn
t
send
some
word
about
a
potato
freight
i
no
for
three
reasons
first
because
it
isn
t
the
truth
secondly
because
he
believes
that
he
has
no
schooner
and
thirdly
because
he
is
indifferent
to
potato
well
what
shall
we
tell
him
then
this
conversation
went
on
every
one
speaking
at
once
but
no
one
being
able
to
think
of
any
plausible
message
to
send
to
captain
corbet
which
should
be
true
and
at
the
same
time
not
disclose
the
actual
facts
at
last
they
concluded
that
it
was
impossible
to
make
up
such
a
message
and
as
the
time
was
passing
they
determined
to
send
for
him
at
all
hazards
but
who
would
go
pat
at
once
offered
much
to
the
relief
of
all
the
others
who
wanted
to
be
on
the
spot
when
captain
corbet
arrived
pat
however
was
very
and
didn
t
at
all
mind
the
long
walk
but
promised
to
be
back
in
an
hour
along
with
captain
corbet
don
t
tell
him
about
the
schooner
unless
you
have
to
said
bruce
sure
an
what
ll
i
tell
him
thin
o
tell
him
anything
at
all
so
long
as
it
s
the
truth
and
no
humbug
you
know
just
tell
him
in
a
general
way
something
or
somethin
or
other
in
a
gineral
way
repeated
pat
yes
something
that
ll
make
him
come
down
you
know
and
don
t
tell
him
about
the
schooner
unless
you
have
deed
thin
an
i
won
t

ll
tell
him
somethin
in
gineral
an
nothin
in
but
no
humbug
you
no
surely
not
it
s
mesilf
that
won
and
with
these
words
pat
took
himself
off
xxiv
between
pat
and
captain
meeting
between
captain
corbet
and
the
pat
alone
with
the
corbet

an
exile
and

a
fog

briskly
and
in
due
time

captain
corbet
s
house

the
door

a
voice

he
wished
to

aged
navigator
was
seated
near
a
cradle
gently
tilting
the
rocker
with
his
foot
and
thus
giving
to
it
an
easy
and
agreeable
motion
there
was
a
smile
of
peace
on
corbet
s
mild
countenance
which
deepened
into
a
smile
of
welcome
as
he
recognized

said
captain
corbet
do
an
be
quick
ah
now
none
of
that
cried
pat
as
the
fond
father
stooped
over
the
cradle
of
his
infant
sure
ye
ll
wake
him
so
ye
will
hurry
wal
i
was
just
goin
to
kiss
him
but
p
aps
i
d
better
not
so
i
ll
and
with
these
words
captain
corbet
tore
himself
away
from
the
cradle
and
left
the
house
he
walked
with
rapid
strides
yet
his
breast
was
a
prey
to
contending
feelings
on
the
one
hand
he
was
exceedingly
curious
to
know
what
it
was
that
the
boys
had
for
him
and
he
was
also
anxious
to
gratify
them
but
then
on
the
other
hand
he
was
disturbed
about
his
baby
and
full
of
fear
lest
some
evil
might
befall
him
during
his
absence
his
progress
which
at
first
was
rapid
soon
slackened
and
then
grew
slower
and
finally
stopped
altogether
he
turned
irresolutely
and
looked
back
but
all
was
still
this
encouraged
him
to
resume
his
journey
again
and
again
he
turned
and
looked
back
and
each
time
he
was
reassured
at
last
he
descended
the
hill
and
his
home
could
no
longer
be
seen
even
then
he
stopped
and
looked
back
several
times
as
though
he
expected
that
a
cry
from
his
deserted
infant
might
meet
his
ears
but
no
cry
came
and
he
went
on
at
length
he
came
to
the
village
and
finding
himself
thus
far
committed
to
his
journey
he
concluded
that
it
would
be
better
to
make
haste
so
as
to
be
back
as
soon
as
possible
with
this
resolve
he
set
off
at
a
run
and
soon
reached
the
wharf
scarcely
had
he
made
his
appearance
when
a
wild
cheer
arose
at
first
the
captain
could
see
nothing
but
a
crowd
of
boys
who
gathered
round
him
shouting
and
cheering
partly
inquisitive
and
partly
bewildered
he
looked
from
one
to
the
other
with
inquiring
yet
puzzled
glances
and
said
not
a
word
but
the
boys
did
not
keep
him
long
in
suspense
thronging
around
him
they
took
his
arms
and
half
led
half
urged
him
onward
to
the
river
bank
where
full
before
him
floated
the
antelope
even
then
perhaps
captain
corbet
might
not
have
noticed
the
schooner
had
it
not
been
for
the
cries
and
gestures
of
the
boys
the
effect
of
this
sudden
and
unexpected
sight
as
he
realized
its
meaning
was
overwhelming
he
started
he
stared
he
rubbed
his
eyes
he
looked
at
the
boys
then
at
the
antelope
then
at
the
boys
again
and
then
once
more
at
the
antelope
he
could
not
speak
a
word
he
stared
in
utter
amazement
his
belief
in
her
complete
and
hopeless
loss
had
been
perfect
and
now
to
see
her
floating
before
him
was
an
overwhelming
sight
that
deprived
him
of
the
power
of
speech
his
emotion
was
so
great
that
his
aged
form
trembled
visibly
he
burst
into
tears
and
then
turning
towards
the
boys
without
speaking
a
word
he
went
around
among
them
shaking
hands
with
every
one
of
them
most
earnestly
thar
said
he
at
last
as
he
drew
a
long
breath
i
don
t
think
i
ever
in
all
my
born
days
saw
a
day
like
this
here
an
who
did
it
did
youns
do
it
all
every
bit
we
did
some
of
it
said
bart
but
it
was
captain
pratt
that
did
the
most
of
it
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
him
it
couldn
t
have
been
done
at
captain
pratt
bless
his
benevolent
sperrit

him
whar

was
the
occasion

wanted
me
for
wal
railly
and
here
s
the
antelope
an
here
am
i
gazing
upon
her
form
captain
corbet
spoke
these
words
meditatively
and
then
made
an
effort
to
climb
on
board
this
he
soon
succeeded
in
doing
thereupon
he
feasted
his
eyes
upon
the
schooner
examining
her
in
every
part
muddy
said
he
solemnly
muddy
yet
lively
and
fit
for
more
vyges
so
soon
as
you
get
rigged
up
and
boys
he
continued
after
a
long
silence
standing
on
the
deck
of
the
antelope
and
addressing
his
young
friends
boys
you
onman
me
an
the
aged
corbet
relapses
intew
a
kine
o
second
childhood
for
i
hed
given
her
up
for

i
hed
seen
in
her
ruination
a
warnin
to
me
that
i
was
to
desert
forevermore
the
rolling
ocean
and
confind
myself
to
hum
but
this
here

an
hour

year
in
sickness
and
health
with

an
i
always
counted

dyin
together

when
i
thought

terewly
a
sunderation
of
my
heartstrings
i
felt
her
dume

mine
but
now
i
see
her
raised
up
out
of
her
muddy
bed
of
mortial
illness
an
brought
up
and
set

to
walk

waters

thar
is
one
at

that
demands
my
return
one
known
to
most
of
ye
about
whom
i
feel
dreadful
anxious
bein
as
i
ve
ben
and
left
him
in
onexperienced
hands
an
me
not
knowin
but
he
s
cryin
his
perecious
eyes
out
this
moment
boys
adoo
you
have
a
parient
s
gratitood
with
these
words
the
venerable
corbet
left
the
schooner
and
after
shaking
hands
with
a
few
of
them
hurried
home
as
fast
as
he
could
while
the
boys
feeling
now
that
their
work
was
at
length
complete
returned
to
the
school
meanwhile
pat
had
been
left
alone
with
the
baby
pat
knew
nothing
whatever
about
the
care
of
babies
and
had
volunteered
the
charge
of
this
one
out
of
the
kindness
of
his
heart
never
supposing
that
he
would
be
called
on
to
display
any
of
the
qualities
of
a
nurse
in
this
as
in
many
other
cases
ignorance
made
him
rash
in
his
enterprise
for
about
half
an
hour
all
went
on
well
and
pat
after
jogging
the
cradle
for
a
little
while
grew
tired
and
amused
himself
with
looking
around
the
room
but
from
these
pursuits
he
was
roused
by
a
movement
on
the
part
of
the
baby
back
then
he
darted
to
the
cradle
with
a
vague
fear
that
the
baby
would
wake
and
began
rocking
it
vigorously
but
such
very
vigorous
treatment
as
this
instead
of
lulling
the
wakeful
infant
back
again
to
the
land
of
sleep
only
roused
him
the
more
pat
therefore
cherishing
in
his
memory
all
of
captain
corbet
s
directions
did
as
he
had
been
ordered
and
rocked
the
cradle
harder
but
the
baby
only
grew
wider
awake
and
began
to
murmur
and
fret
woroo
this
ll
niver
do
at
all
at
all
said
pat
he
towld
me
to
sing
if
it
grew
worse
so
sing
it
is
and
here
whereupon
pat
began
a
wild
shrill
crooning
chant
about
some
personage
named
biddy
malone
whose
eventful
history
however
he
was
not
able
to
complete
for
the
baby
waking
wide
up
began
to
cry
very
vociferously
sure
an
it
s
all
up
wid
me
said
pat
i
ll
do
not
a
one
of
me
knows
at
all
at
all
he
said
if
he
got
worse
to
take
him
up
i
don
t
know
about
it
but
how
and
iver
here
so
stooping
down
with
the
best
intentions
in
the
world
pat
took
the
baby
up
in
his
arms
and
put
it
on
his
knee
in
the
hope
that
this
plan
might
succeed
in
sending
it
off
to
sleep
but
it
didn
t
succeed
any
better
than
the
other
plans
for
whether
the
baby
was
fastidious
and
didn
t
like
pat
s
treatment
or
whether
pat
handled
him
too
roughly
or
whether
he
was
hungry
and
wanted
food
or
ill
and
wanted
nursing
whichever
of
these
it
was
certain
it
is
that
the
moment
pat
took
him
up
he
sent
forth
a
cry
that
struck
terror
to
pat
s
soul
and
made
the
welkin
ring
och
murther
murther
said
pat
what
iver
ll
i
do
at
all
wid
it
an
me
to
be
here
for
more
than
two
good
hours
then
i
tell
ye
arrah
will
ye
niver
be
quiet
what
ll
i
do
at
all
at
all
sure
an
he
said
to
walk
about
wid
it
that
same
i
ll
do
this
so
pat
rose
from
the
chair
and
proceeded
to
walk
about
the
room
but
the
new
treatment
did
no
good
on
the
contrary
the
baby
cried
harder
it
is
to
be
feared
that
pat
s
handling
was
rougher
than
what
the
baby
had
been
accustomed
to
and
that
pat
s
patience
being
quite
exhausted
prevented
any
gentleness
in
his
treatment
of
his
ten
der
charge
and
so
it
was
that
the
baby
bawled
and
pat
groaned
and
was
completely
at
his
wit
s
end
och
but
it
s
nearly
dead
an
kilt
i
am
cried
pat
at
last
what
was
it
that
he
said
to
do
next
he
said
to
sing
and
knock
the
furniture
about
so
he
did
it
s
the
racket
that
ll
soothe
him
deed
an
it
is
and
that
s
what
i
ll
with
this
pat
began
another
song
a
little
livelier
than
the
last
and
walking
about
the
room
he
began
to
knock
upon
the
furniture
he
upset
two
chairs
he
beat
upon
a
tin
pan
he
rapped
the
poker
against
the
he
rattled
the
leaf
of
the
table
he
kicked
over
a
small
table
and
several
stools
he
rolled
tin
kettles
about
the
floor
until
at
last
the
room
presented
an
appearance
that
made
it
seem
as
if
a
mad
bull
had
been
there
kicking
indiscriminately
but
notwithstanding
pat
s
efforts
he
could
not
succeed
the
baby
who
at
first
had
been
silent
for
a
few
moments
perhaps
from
astonishment
now
began
louder
wilder
and
more
passionate
cries
till
the
noise
from
those
small
lungs
drowned
the
uproar
that
pat
was
making
och
murther
cried
pat
at
last
sure
it
s
bothered
i
am
and
dead
bate
intirely
whativer
i
ll
do
now
it
ud
take
more
n
me
to
tell
sure
an
i
ve
made
all
the
noise
i
know
what
ll
i
do
now
there
s
the
feed
he
said
so
he
did
an
i
ll
thry
it
was
pat
s
last
resort
and
he
tried
it
the
bowl
was
there
where
captain
corbet
had
pointed
it
out
pat
seized
it
and
taking
the
spoon
offered
it
to
the
baby
but
the
baby
treated
his
offer
with
scorn
he
opened
his
mouth
indeed
but
it
was
only
to
let
forth
a
yell
so
loud
so
long
and
withal
so
passionate
that
the
spoon
fell
from
pat
s
hands
upon
the
floor
while
the
bowl
which
he
had
been
trying
to
balance
on
his
knee
followed
with
a
crash
pat
jumped
up
still
holding
the
baby
and
walked
wildly
about
singing
at
the
top
of
his
voice
and
renewing
the
useless
racket
he
went
to
the
door
and
looked
wildly
down
the
road
hoping
to
see
some
signs
of
captain
corbet
though
time
had
not
yet
elapsed
sufficient
for
him
to
reach
the
schooner
then
he
returned
to
the
room
then
he
tried
the
cradle
again
then
walking
and
again
the
cradle
and
then
once
more
walking
so
the
time
passed
at
length
on
looking
down
the
road
he
saw
a
female
she
was
walking
up
it
and
would
soon
come
near
the
house
on
this
woman
he
hung
all
his
hopes
perhaps
she
was
corbet
herself
the
thought
filled
him
with
joy
if
not
if
she
was
a
stranger
he
determined
to
arrest
her
and
make
her
soothe
the
frantic
child
the
house
stood
back
from
the
road
about
fifty
yards
pat
watched
through
the
window
the
motions
of
the
approaching
female
himself
unseen
she
drew
nearer
at
last
her
ears
caught
the
cries
of
the
baby
her
brows
contracted
she
walked
faster
she
reached
the
gate
she
turned
in
i
t
s
herself
cried
pat
he
sprang
to
the
cradle
and
laid
the
screaming
child
inside
then
he
sprang
to
the
back
door
and
closing
it
stood
outside
peeping
through
the
to
see
the
result
the
woman
entered
with
surprise
on
her
face
she
looked
all
around
she
called
corbet
corbet
in
an
angry
voice
but
no
corbet
replied
then
she
went
to
the
cradle
and
took
the
baby
in
her
arms
looking
around
with
wonder
in
her
eyes
then
she
soothed
the
baby
which
speedily
became
quiet
it
s
corbet
muttered
pat
it
s
herself
i
m
safe
i
m
free
i
ll
run
hurroo
and
with
these
words
he
skipped
away
and
never
stopped
till
he
reached
his
own
room
that
evening
the
boys
on
their
return
to
the
hill
were
very
curious
to
know
how
pat
had
fared
with
the
baby
captain
corbet
had
hinted
that
he
had
left
his
child
under
pat
s
care
and
many
conjectures
had
been
made
as
to
the
success
of
the
new
nurse
pat
however
shunned
the
public
eye
for
that
evening
so
that
it
was
not
until
the
following
day
that
they
had
a
chance
of
asking
him
about
his
experience
at
first
pat
fought
them
off
and
returned
evasive
answers
but
gradually
he
disclosed
all
the
curiosity
of
the
boys
then
turned
towards
the
meeting
that
may
have
taken
place
between
the
indignant
corbet
and
the
innocent
captain
on
his
return
but
of
the
nature
of
that
meeting
they
were
destined
to
remain
in
ignorance
all
was
left
to
conjecture
and
such
powerful
imaginations
as
theirs
supplied
them
with
many
vivid
fancy
sketches
of
scenes
wherein
figured
the
justly
irate
wife
and
the
injured
yet
forbearing
corbet
time
passed
on
until
at
length
one
afternoon
a
thrill
of
excitement
was
thrown
over
the
playground
by
the
appearance
of
corbet
himself
like
all
popular
favorites
he
was
received
with
an
uproarious
greeting
he
accepted
the
tribute
with
a
mild
and
pensive
countenance
and
by
his
manner
showed
that
something
unusual
was
going
to
take
place
what
that
was
they
soon
learned
with
a
moistened
eye
and
not
without
emotion
he
informed
them
that
he
was
shortly
about
to
leave
them
and
had
come
down
for
the
especial
purpose
of
bidding
them
good
by
this
announcement
was
received
with
astonishment
and
sorrow
upon
further
questioning
they
learned
that
he
was
going
to
take
a
cargo
of
potatoes
to
boston
yes
boys
said
he
mournfully
the
aged
corbet
must
again
become
a
wanderer
with
taters

home

heavin
billow

his
destination
bosting
an

here
captain
corbet
paused
and
appeared
somewhat
agitated
he
then
prepared
to
bid
them
farewell
but
the
boys
would
not
listen
to
this
his
farewell
should
take
place
elsewhere
he
was
going
to
leave
on
the
next
day
and
as
that
day
was
saturday
they
promised
to
be
down
at
the
wharf
to
see
him
off
the
schooner
was
to
sail
in
the
afternoon
and
all
the
boys
were
on
the
spot
punctually
immediately
after
dinner
soon
corbet
made
his
appearance
the
meek
the
gentle
and
the
venerable
navigator
looked
upon
them
all
with
a
mournful
smile
you
know
the
song
you
made
boys
said
he
sadly
should
captain
corbet
be
forgot
a
sailing
o
er
the
sea
wal
don
t
forget
never
cried
bart
as
he
grasped
his
hand
in
farewell
the
melancholy
captain
then
went
round
and
shook
hands
with
all
of
them
in
silence
then
he
went
on
board
of
his
schooner
the
antelope
had
been
renovated
all
the
traces
of
her
mishap
had
been
obliterated
a
coat
of
neat
coal
tar
covered
her
fair
outlines
another
coat
of
grease
adorned
her
tapering
masts
sundry
patches
were
here
and
there
visible
on
her
flowing
sails
that
hold
which
had
once
carried
the
boys
over
minas
bay
was
now
filled
with
potatoes
the
tide
was
high
and
on
the
turn
the
wind
was
fair
corbet
took
the
helm
the
man
wade
whose
old
oman
s
name
was
gipson
who
had
been
mate
on
their
memorable
cruise
sailed
now
with
captain

in
the
following
capacities
mate

s
mate
crew
the
lines
were
cast
off
the
antelope
caught
the
breeze
and
yielding
at
the
same
moment
to
the
tide
she
moved
away
from
the
land
and
down
the
tortuous
channel
of
mud
creek
the
boys
followed
along
the
banks
of
the
creek
till
they
reached
its
mouth
here
they
stood
in
silence
outside
a
thick
veil
of
fog
covered
the
water
and
hid
all
the
scene
from
view
the
antelope
sailed
on
and
passing
the
boys
entered
the
water
beyond
the
boys
tossed
up
their
hats
and
breaking
the
solemn
silence
sent
over
the
water
loud
shouts
of
good
by
the
shout
reached
the
ears
of
the
captain
he
turned
his
mild
face
was
visible
for
a
few
moments
as
he
waved
his
hand
again
and
again
in
token
of
adieu
then
he
turned
again
and
so
the
boys
stood
there
watching
until
at
last
the
antelope
entered
a
thick
fog
bank
and
bore
the
captain
slowly
away
from
their
gaze
