secret
societies
whew
i
m
glad
they
don
t
have
them
at
our
the
speaker
a
boy
of
sixteen
perched
himself
upon
the
porch
railing
and
swung
his
legs
contentedly
as
if
he
had
uttered
the
last
word
on
the
subject
the
two
girls
to
whom
the
remark
was
addressed
listened
eagerly
ruth
henry
the
small
one
who
was
obviously
no
relation
of
the
boy
leaned
forward
challenging
him
with
her
eyes
she
asked
quickly
what
makes
you
say
that
jack
have
you
any
grounds
the
other
girl
whose
fair
hair
and
straight
nose
resembled
the
boy
strongly
enough
to
identify
her
as
his
sister
looked
impatient
he
doesn
t
know
a
thing
about
them
she
said
now
listen
marj
remonstrated
jack
in
the
tone
one
might
use
to
a
child
although
his
sister
was
only
two
years
his
junior
haven
t
you
ever
heard
dad
tell
about
the
awful
things
some
of
those
secret
societies
did
when
he
was
at
college
they
had
a
house
without
a
single
window
and
with
only
one
door
made
of
iron
and
nobody
ever
knew
what
went
on
inside
but
dad
said
one
poor
freshman
who
was
to
be
initiated
got
rebellious
and
wouldn
t
do
the
stunts
and
they
blindfolded
him
and
threw
him
into
the
creek
it
was
cold
and
he
got
pneumonia
and
died
oh
jack
you
re
exaggerating
exclaimed
marjorie
scornfully
you
read
about
that
in
a
book
you
must
have
forgotten
anyway
girls
societies
wouldn
t
do
anything
like
but
ruth
s
dark
eyes
were
sparkling
at
the
idea
of
adventure
and
danger
if
the
truth
were
told
it
was
because
of
these
very
secret
societies
or
sororities
as
the
girls
called
them
that
she
had
persuaded
her
mother
to
let
her
register
among
the
freshmen
at
miss
allen
s
boarding
school
for
the
coming
fall
and
marjorie
wilkinson
a
more
timid
girl
desired
to
go
simply
that
she
might
be
with
ruth
both
families
had
at
last
consented
but
too
late
to
give
the
girls
a
chance
to
secure
a
room
together
the
idea
of
a
strange
filled
marjorie
with
dismay
but
to
ruth
it
meant
new
opportunities
for
friendship
and
a
new
chance
to
make
one
of
the
secret
societies
a
week
after
the
foregoing
conversation
the
girls
were
on
their
way
to
the
school
they
had
been
satisfied
to
sit
quietly
during
most
of
the
journey
contenting
themselves
with
looking
out
of
the
window
and
dreaming
of
future
popularity
and
happiness
it
was
only
after
they
were
seated
in
the
school
hack
that
marjorie
was
seized
with
a
sudden
pang
of
homesickness
if
we
only
could
have
roomed
together
she
sighed
clasping
ruth
s
hand
and
looking
away
from
the
gathering
darkness
promise
me
ruth
she
said
ardently
whoever
your
is
you
won
t
like
her
better
than
me
jealous
teased
ruth
how
do
i
know
who
i
m
going
to
like
then
seriously
marj
you
suppose
we
ll
be
asked
to
join
a
sorority
maybe
you
will
but
i
never
would
answered
marjorie
i
can
t
make
friends
quickly
at
this
moment
the
hack
stopped
in
front
of
the
school
door
miss
allen
s
boarding
school
originally
started
in
a
beautiful
old
house
which
had
been
in
her
family
for
generations
she
began
with
about
fifteen
pupils
and
only
one
teacher
besides
herself
each
year
she
was
forced
to
add
a
little
more
to
the
buildings
until
now
her
school
accommodated
almost
a
hundred
girls
the
lovely
big
trees
wide
porches
and
large
grounds
made
the
spot
an
ideal
one
for
a
boarding
school
at
one
end
of
the
estate
there
was
a
small
pond
where
the
girls
went
skating
in
winter
and
there
were
also
wonderful
little
groves
which
could
be
used
for
picnics
whenever
the
principal
s
permission
could
be
obtained
the
swimming
pool
the
gymnasium
and
the
hockey
field
supplied
ample
facilities
for
the
athletic
girl
to
indulge
her
desire
for
more
strenuous
sport
as
ruth
and
marjorie
approached
and
saw
the
bright
lights
through
the
windows
and
heard
the
happy
girls
laughter
they
felt
indeed
that
they
had
reached
the
place
of
their
dreams
marjorie
s
feeling
of
homesickness
vanished
as
miss
landis
the
english
teacher
came
to
greet
them
how
do
you
do
girls
she
said
cordially
i
m
miss
landis
will
you
tell
me
your
names
i
am
ruth
henry
and
this
is
marjorie
wilkinson
replied
ruth
we
re
so
glad
to
be
here
she
added
after
our
long
i
will
take
you
to
your
rooms
said
miss
landis
leading
the
way
marjorie
was
charmed
by
miss
landis
s
manner
which
seemed
so
cordial
and
pleasant
that
she
decided
if
everyone
at
school
were
like
her
it
surely
would
be
a
delightful
place
but
ruth
s
thoughts
had
taken
an
entirely
different
direction
who
are
our
she
asked
as
they
ascended
the
stairs
let
me
think
said
miss
landis
it
s
hard
to
remember
with
so
many
girls
but
i
helped
miss
allen
with
the
she
stopped
as
they
reached
the
second
floor
oh
yes
she
continued
you
room
with
ethel
todd
a
sophomore
she
s
a
splendid
girl
very
popular
you
re
lucky
and
your
she
turned
to
marjorie
hasn
t
come
yet
she
s
a
freshman
named
lily
they
walked
down
the
corridor
and
stopped
at
the
room
which
was
to
be
ruth
s
in
answer
to
miss
landis
s
knock
a
pretty
girl
about
sixteen
years
old
opened
the
door
disclosing
an
attractive
interior
with
three
large
windows
miss
landis
introduced
the
girls
ethel
apologized
for
the
appearance
of
the
room
you
see
i
am
just
hanging
the
pictures
and
putting
up
the
curtains
she
said
turning
to
ruth
she
added
it
will
be
lovely
to
have
you
to
help
me
ruth
s
eyes
danced
already
she
was
fascinated
by
ethel
now
i
ll
show
you
to
your
room
said
miss
landis
to
marjorie
i
m
sorry
there
will
be
no
there
to
welcome
you
but
then
you
can
do
that
for
her
when
she
as
they
went
up
another
flight
of
stairs
marjorie
asked
does
she
does
ruth
s
belong
to
any
of
the
sororities
yes
she
belongs
to
sorority
replied
miss
landis
there
s
only
one
but
we
teachers
wish
there
weren
t
any
for
it
takes
the
girls
minds
from
their
lessons
and
their
athletics
and
besides
it
causes
a
good
deal
of
unhappiness
repeated
marjorie
in
astonishment
why
i
should
think
it
would
be
all
it
is
for
those
who
belong
but
you
see
only
sixteen
girls
four
out
of
each
class
are
chosen
and
most
of
the
other
girls
in
the
school
are
miserable
because
they
aren
t
asked
to
join
we
d
like
to
abolish
it
but
some
of
the
prominent
alumnæ
who
are
members
of
the
board
belong
and
as
long
as
the
girls
want
it
they
won
t
hear
of
doing
away
with
miss
landis
stopped
before
a
door
at
the
back
of
the
building
here
is
your
room
she
said
as
the
teacher
threw
open
the
door
marjorie
experienced
a
chill
of
disappointment
in
contrast
to
ruth
s
attractive
room
hers
was
dark
and
small
with
only
one
window
and
the
slanting
roof
extended
down
over
part
of
the
wall
and
it
was
very
bare
only
the
bed
seemed
ready
for
use
i
m
sorry
you
ll
be
alone
said
miss
landis
but
i
ll
come
and
take
you
over
to
ruth
s
room
to
go
down
to
supper
with
her
i
ll
be
back
in
twenty
it
was
all
marjorie
could
do
to
keep
from
crying
mechanically
she
began
to
take
off
her
hat
and
coat
i
feel
just
like
poor
little
paul
dombey
who
was
sent
to
that
dreary
school
of
doctor
blimber
s
in
dickens
thought
marjorie
only
i
guess
everything
will
be
all
right
when
i
see
ruth
again
and
meet
my
the
bell
for
supper
had
already
rung
in
a
few
minutes
miss
landis
returned
and
they
started
off
together
for
ruth
s
room
there
was
no
answer
to
miss
landis
s
knock
at
the
door
she
must
have
gone
down
with
her
said
miss
landis
never
mind
you
can
come
with
me
i
ll
find
you
a
the
was
brilliantly
lighted
seven
long
tables
were
placed
in
various
parts
of
the
room
the
girls
most
of
them
in
light
summer
dresses
were
crowding
in
and
sitting
down
anywhere
as
the
regular
seats
were
not
yet
assigned
marjorie
noticed
that
one
teacher
sat
at
each
table
where
would
you
like
to
sit
asked
miss
landis
just
then
marjorie
spied
ruth
sitting
beside
ethel
todd
at
the
farthest
table
under
the
window
i
want
to
sit
over
there
near
the
window
with
ruth
i
am
sorry
said
miss
landis
but
i
wouldn
t
advise
you
to
sit
there
without
an
invitation
all
those
girls
belong
to
φαβ
phi
alpha
beta
the
sorority
except
the
freshmen
who
have
been
invited
there
by
them
and
you
wouldn
t
want
to
sit
there
without
an
at
that
moment
marjorie
felt
all
the
bitterness
of
the
outcast
ruth
will
make
the
sorority
and
i
won
t
she
thought
but
she
gave
her
attention
to
miss
landis
who
introduced
her
to
some
other
freshmen
when
supper
was
over
marjorie
asked
some
of
her
new
friends
to
her
room
they
did
visit
her
for
a
few
minutes
but
they
were
all
tired
and
left
early
marjorie
went
to
bed
without
even
bothering
to
unpack
or
to
make
any
attempt
to
see
ruth
never
run
after
the
sorority
girls
miss
landis
had
advised
and
marjorie
intended
to
profit
by
the
advice
chapter
ii
marjorie
s
when
marjorie
awoke
in
her
bare
little
room
the
next
morning
a
feeling
of
happy
anticipation
came
over
her
what
was
it
oh
yes
she
was
away
at
school
and
she
was
to
meet
her
new
she
jumped
out
of
bed
and
dressed
quickly
so
that
she
had
time
to
take
a
stroll
in
the
garden
before
the
breakfast
bell
rang
she
met
several
of
the
girls
she
had
sat
with
at
supper
the
night
before
and
they
asked
her
to
join
their
group
why
there
goes
ruth
exclaimed
marjorie
funny
she
didn
t
see
me
ruth
who
asked
ada
mearns
a
sophomore
ruth
henry
my
best
friend
from
home
she
s
with
some
girls
i
don
t
oh
yes
said
ada
following
the
direction
of
marjorie
s
gaze
those
are
all
φαβ
girls
with
her
i
guess
your
young
friend
s
made
a
hit
probably
she
ll
be
one
of
the
lucky
what
lucky
four
asked
another
freshman
one
of
the
lucky
four
freshmen
to
be
asked
to
join
the
sorority
marjorie
bit
her
lip
i
m
not
going
to
be
miserable
and
jealous
she
thought
only
i
don
t
see
why
ruth
has
to
drop
me
for
her
new
my
word
exclaimed
ada
suddenly
look
at
this
funny
package
coming
up
the
walk
the
girls
all
looked
in
the
direction
ada
indicated
and
saw
the
girl
trudging
up
the
path
carrying
a
suitcase
and
a
hatbox
she
was
short
and
very
fat
and
vulgarly
overdressed
in
clothes
far
too
old
for
a
girl
of
her
years
a
velvet
coat
gray
suede
shoes
and
stockings
and
a
large
hat
trimmed
with
ostrich
plumes
she
seemed
hot
and
out
of
breath
when
she
came
abreast
of
the
girls
she
stopped
excuse
me
she
said
but
will
you
tell
me
where
to
go
i
m
the
new
girl
who
was
coming
new
girl
laughed
ada
don
t
you
know
there
are
several
other
freshmen
to
be
exact
the
stout
girl
looked
as
if
she
were
not
listening
my
name
s
lily
andrews
i
m
from
new
york
don
t
you
any
of
you
know
where
my
room
is
marjorie
s
face
fell
so
this
was
her
this
unattractive
young
lady
whose
whole
bearing
stamped
her
as
newly
rich
why
should
she
marjorie
have
the
bad
luck
to
draw
something
like
this
when
ruth
had
fallen
in
with
one
of
the
most
popular
and
influential
girls
of
the
school
however
she
answered
yes
i
know
where
your
room
is
miss
andrews
for
i
m
the
freshman
who
is
to
room
with
you
i
ll
take
you
to
it
there
s
just
time
before
the
second
bell
marjorie
took
lily
s
suitcase
and
the
two
girls
walked
off
together
poor
marjorie
sighed
ada
i
hope
she
has
the
good
sense
to
drop
lily
talked
all
the
way
upstairs
about
the
clothes
she
had
brought
when
they
arrived
at
the
room
and
marjorie
opened
the
door
she
uttered
an
exclamation
of
disgust
what
she
exclaimed
me
lily
andrews
have
to
live
in
a
room
like
this
when
my
father
s
rich
enough
to
buy
me
a
suite
at
the
mcalpin
marjorie
tried
to
explain
you
see
the
older
girls
choose
their
rooms
and
the
freshmen
are
assigned
the
ones
that
are
left
it
ll
only
be
for
one
year
then
we
get
our
chance
to
i
ll
never
live
here
for
a
year
i
couldn
t
stand
it
marjorie
s
hopes
rose
what
are
you
going
to
do
she
asked
go
back
home
no
indeed
said
lily
and
miss
all
the
fun
i
ve
read
so
much
about
no
i
ll
just
go
tell
miss
allen
i
ll
pay
more
and
she
ll
give
me
a
better
room
besides
i
want
to
room
with
an
upper
classman
who
already
belongs
to
the
secret
society
so
as
i
ll
be
asked
to
join
marjorie
remembered
the
attractive
girls
who
sat
under
the
window
the
previous
night
who
were
members
of
φαβ
and
she
smiled
to
herself
poor
lily
she
didn
t
know
what
was
in
store
for
her
i
wouldn
t
do
that
if
i
were
you
the
rooms
are
all
assigned
now
and
i
don
t
believe
miss
allen
would
make
any
changes
hurry
up
there
s
the
last
bell
for
breakfast
they
went
into
the
together
and
both
girls
were
conscious
of
the
fact
that
all
eyes
were
turned
upon
them
lily
thought
it
was
because
of
her
expensive
clothing
but
marjorie
knew
better
and
blushed
after
classes
that
afternoon
when
lily
and
marjorie
were
unpacking
their
trunks
and
doing
their
best
to
arrange
their
homely
little
room
to
make
it
look
attractive
ruth
knocked
at
the
door
marjorie
experienced
a
joyful
surprise
as
her
old
friend
appeared
i
m
so
glad
to
see
you
ruth
she
exclaimed
i
want
you
to
meet
my
miss
andrews
this
is
miss
henry
ruth
bowed
and
lily
murmured
pleased
to
meet
you
i
m
well
how
do
you
like
it
all
by
this
time
asked
marjorie
are

an
enormous
box

in
white

and
tied
with
pink
ribbon

marjorie
but
i
don
t
believe

any
i

the
hockey
team
and
my
brother
always
said

of

most
important
things
about

in
athletics

ruth
nibbling
a
chocolate

marjorie

of
the
sorority

henry

ruth
i
room
with
one
and
she
has
introduced
me
to
quite
a
number
they
re
awfully
i
should
guess
so
said
lily
i
suppose
they
re
the
richest
crowd
at
miss
allen
s
i
d
like
to
invite
them
all
out
to
my
father
s
place
on
long
island
so
they
can
see
where
i
get
off
ruth
laughed
you

not
try
it
she
said

them
do
the
what
are
you
going
to
wear
to
the
sophomore
reception
asked
marjorie
suddenly
my
pink
organdie
what
are
you
my
white
embroidered
voile
i
will
they
be
fancy
enough
asked
lily
i
expect
to
wear
a
blue
net
and
spangled
dress
it
s
quite
the
thing
in
new
york
at
this
moment
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
in
answer
to
marjorie
s
come
three
freshmen
accompanied
by
ada
mearns
a
sophomore
entered
these
girls
were
looking
for
miss
henry
said
ada
and
i
thought
she
might
be
in
ruth
jumped
up
joyfully
hulloa
she
exclaimed
girls
i
want
you
to
meet
marjorie
wilkinson
and
lily
andrews
doris
sands
evelyn
hopkins
and
mae
the
girls
acknowledged
the
introduction
and
marjorie
invited
them
to
sit
down
no
we
simply
can
t
said
doris
ruth
s
ethel
todd
wants
to
take
our
picture
but
we
wouldn
t
consent
to
having
it
without
ruth
i
m
going
too
said
lily
i
want
some
fresh
oh
but
you
re

interposed
ruth
and
we
can
t
keep
ethel
waiting
i
m
sorry
some
other
time
the
four
freshmen
linked
arms
and
went
out
together
those
four
girls
said
ada
lowering
her
voice
are
the
ones
everyone
thinks

be
invited
to
join
how
can
they
tell
so
soon
asked
lily
with
resentment
in
her
voice
it
isn
t
fair
i
think
everybody
ought
to
have
a
chance
i
haven
t
even
met
any
sorority
everybody
will
have
a
chance
don
t
worry
they
don
t
choose
their
candidates
till
six
weeks
are
over
so
they
ll
be
pretty
sure
to
know
everybody
and
of
course
they
may
change
their
minds
and
drop
one
or
all
of
those
i
d
love
to
make
it
sighed
lily
i
m
not
going
to
bother
about
it
said
marjorie
i
m
going
out
for
the
hockey
good
work
said
ada
that
s
the
spirit
but
ada
could
not
tell
from
marjorie
s
words
how
bravely
she
was
struggling
to
hide
her
feelings
we
get
our
regular
places
at
tables
in
the
said
ada
fortunately
they
don
t
allow
any
sorority
stuff
there
the
girls
are
chosen
by
lot
from
each
class
four
girls
from
each
and
a
teacher
besides
then
after
christmas
we
draw
all
over
i
do
hope

get
with
some
nice
girls
said
lily
oh

said
ada
i
never
met
lovelier
she
got
up
from
the
bed
where
she
had
been
sitting
i
must
go
she
said

you
both
at
the
reception
night
if
not
she
hurried
out
and
marjorie
and
lily
resumed
their
unpacking
chapter
iii
the
sophomore
reception
when
the
four
freshmen
left
marjorie
s
room
and
walked
out
of
the
dormitory
to
the
campus
where
ethel
todd
and
marian
guard
and
other
sophomore
members
of
φαβ
were
waiting
with
the
camera
their
whole
bearing
expressed
pride
as
if
they
wanted
to
say
to
the
rest
of
the
school
we
have
been
singled
out
by
the
sorority
as
the
four
most
eligible
freshmen
before
they
reached
ethel
and
marian
the
former
called
out
hurry
up
girls
we
can
t
wait
all
day
then
turning
to
marian
she
said
in
a
low
voice
those
girls
are
entirely
too
sure
of
as
they
came
closer
she
said
aloud
i
always
photograph
a
group
of
girls
from
each
class
to
send
to
mother
but
i
wish
we
could
get
some
more
girls
into
this
ethel
looked
away
for
a
minute
as
if
she
were
thinking
she
turned
to
her
ruth
she
said
who
was
that
girl
i
met
you
with
yesterday
oh
marjorie
wilkinson
was
she
tall
and
pretty
yes
she
s
tall
and
i
suppose
you
might
call
her
pretty
she
has
light
hair
and
brown
eyes
that
s
the
girl
i
mean
couldn
t
you
go
get
her
if
i
wait
a
couple
of
minutes
i
don
t
believe
so
i
don
t
think
she
s
all
right
said
ethel
i
guess
you
will
make
a
good
picture
of
freshness
are
we
so
very
green
asked
doris
nevertheless
highly
flattered
to
be
teased
by
so
important
a
person
as
ethel
todd
absolutely
replied
ethel
now
arrange
yourselves
in
a
she
looked
into
the
camera
and
saw
ruth
partly
hidden
behind
doris
she
wants
to
be
urged
to
a
more
prominent
position
thought
ethel
but
she
s
going
to
get
left
she
said
nothing
and
snapped
the
picture
then
turning
to
marian
it
s
time
to
dress
she
said
let
s
go
ruth
joined
them
inwardly
thanking
her
stars
that
she
roomed
with
ethel
after
they
had
reached
their
room
and
marian
had
left
them
ethel
said
night
i
want
to
make
it
a
point
to
meet
this
marjorie
wilkinson
will
you
ask
her
to
come
over
and
go
to
the
reception
with
us
i
don
t
believe
she
d
want
to
i
think
i
heard
her
planning
to
go
with
her
well
let
her
bring
her
along
ruth
burst
out
laughing
if
you
d
ever
see
her
she
exclaimed
she
dresses
like
a
christmas
tree
and
she
s
always
talking
about
her
father
s
money
she
s
simply
impossible
then
i
shouldn
t
think
your
friend
marjorie
would
care
for
oh
she
likes
anybody
said
ruth
anxious
to
dismiss
the
other
girl
from
the
mind
of
her
let
s
finish
putting
up
the
anyway
said
ethel
i
want
to
know
marjorie
wilkinson
she
looks
the
sophomores
had
secured
the
gymnasium
for
their
reception
to
the
freshmen
all
the
afternoon
of
the
following
day
the
committee
was
busy
with
the
decorations
the
girls
had
gone
into
the
woods
and
returned
with
their
arms
full
of
autumn
leaves
and
wild
asters
they
twined
branches
through
the
apparatus
they
covered
the
walls
with
school
banners
and
they
pinned
orange
crepe
paper
over
the
bright
electric
bulbs
to
soften
the
glare
at
quarter
of
six
frances
wright
the
sophomore
president
surveyed
the
hall
approvingly
you
d
never
recognize
the
old
gym
would
you
she
remarked
to
ethel
as
the
girls
started
toward
the
door
the
sophomores
all
ate
rather
hastily
that
evening
in
their
anxiety
to
precede
their
guests
at
the
reception
shortly
after
eight
the
freshmen
began
to
arrive
in
groups
ruth
accompanied
by
her
three
friends
doris
sands
evelyn
hopkins
and
mae
vanhorn
was
among
the
first
to
appear
marjorie
and
lily
came
very
late
lily
had
encountered
difficulty
in
dressing
without
mother
s
maid
to
help
me
she
had
explained
to
her
and
marjorie
had
patiently
waited
for
her
almost
everyone
else
was
there
when
they
finally
arrived
the
reception
committee
had
become
scattered
but
frances
wright
noticed
the
newcomers
as
they
entered
the
room
and
went
forward
to
greet
them
we
re
awfully
glad
to
see
you
girls
she
said
cordially
will
you
forgive
me
if
i
ask
you
your
names
certainly
replied
marjorie
graciously
complying
with
the
president
s
request
marjorie
wilkinson
she
repeated
oh
yes
i
know
you
re
the
girl
ethel
todd
has
been
talking
ethel
todd
ruth
henry
s
asked
marjorie
somewhat
surprised
but
i
only
met
her
once
well
you
must
have
made
an
impression
so
long
as
i
m
not
busy
i
d
like
to
take
you
both
over
to
see
ethel
marian
guard
and
lulu
davids
the
other
sorority
sophomores
were
standing
talking
to
ruth
and
her
three
freshmen
friends
frances
walked
between
lily
and
marjorie
holding
an
arm
of
each
ethel
seemed
particularly
cordial
and
lily
talked
fast
and
loud
realizing
that
their
group
including
as
it
did
the
four
φαβ
sophomores
must
be
the
center
of
attraction
and
the
envy
of
all
the
other
freshmen
just
then
the
musicians
struck
up
a
ethel
asked
marjorie
immediately
for
a
dance
and
the
two
whirled
off
together
marian
and
lulu
asked
doris
and
mae
and
frances
wright
excused
herself
to
attend
to
some
other
matters
ruth
and
evelyn
stood
watching
the
dancers
as
lily
turned
to
them
my
aren
t
these
sorority
girls
swell
she
said
i
like
them
a
lot
and
i
never
thought
i
d
get
in
with
them
so
quick
but
my
father
said
he
bet
i
d
wear
their
pin
home
thanksgiving
ruth
looked
contemptuous
and
evelyn
laughed
out
loud
let
s
dance
together
suggested
ruth
and
without
even
an
apology
they
left
lily
standing
alone
at
the
end
of
the
dance
games
were
introduced
to
scatter
the
groups
and
even
ruth
found
herself
in
a
few
moments
far
away
from
her
beloved
sorority
friends
but
they
managed
to
get
together
again
for
refreshments
when
everybody
was
seated
ethel
suddenly
asked
where
is
marjorie
wilkinson
she
s
over
there
with
some
of
her
freshmen
friends
said
ruth
i
d
like
to
have
her
with
us
said
ethel
ruth
will
you
go
over
and
ask
her
to
join
our
group
ruth
frowned
slightly
but
rose
obediently
to
do
as
ethel
requested
she
showed
rather
plainly
however
that
she
did
not
especially
want
marjorie
and
the
latter
was
quick
to
recognize
her
feeling
no
thank
you
said
marjorie
it
s
very
kind
of
miss
todd
but
i
can
t
leave
lily
and
the
other
girls
i
am
i
ll
go
said
lily
even
if
marjorie
doesn
t
care
to
she
rose
and
slipped
her
fat
arm
covered
with
expensive
bracelets
into
ruth
s
it
s
such
fun
she
exclaimed
ethel
expressed
her
disappointment
well
then
i
am
going
over
to
talk
to
her
she
said
don
t
you
want
to
come
with
me
marian
as
both
girls
rose
lily
announced
i
believe
i
ll
change
my
mind
and
go
back
again
so
that
i
ll
be
with
marjorie
when
it
s
time
to
go
everyone
laughed
as
lily
tagged
along
after
the
two
sophomores
ruth
turned
to
doris
isn
t
it
too
bad
to
have
all
our
plans
spoiled
she
asked
you
mean
about
the
sorority
she
lowered
her
voice
and
mae
and
evelyn
drew
their
chairs
nearer
to
the
others
you
see
continued
ruth
up
till
the
φαβ
girls
haven
t
been
paying
attention
to
anybody
except
us
four
girls
and
i
felt
pretty
sure
we
d
be
chosen
now
if
they
get
interested
in
marjorie
wilkinson
one
of
us
is
sure
to
be
left
that
s
so
exclaimed
mae
what
we
ought
to
do
announced
ruth
is
all
stick
together
and
if
they
don
t
ask
all
of
us
then
none
of
us
will
join
i
don
t
approve
of
that
pouted
evelyn
there
are
girls
in
the
freshman
class
and
they
can
ask
four
entirely
different
girls
from
any
of
us
i
for
one
intend
to
join
if
i
am
you
re
not
very
loyal
exclaimed
ruth
how
about
your
loyalty
snapped
evelyn
wasn
t
marjorie
wilkinson
your
friend
and
now
aren
t
you
doing
your
best
to
work
against
her
ruth
did
not
answer
this
accusation
the
situation
was
relieved
by
the
orchestra
starting
to
play
there
s
the
music
for
the
last
waltz
said
doris
i
guess
we
might
as
well
dance
it
together
but
before
the
girls
got
started
ethel
came
back
again
i
want
this
dance
with
my
she
said
taking
ruth
s
hand
ruth
looked
up
happily
and
they
started
off
together
and
i
m
going
to
take
you
home
she
said
each
sophomore
takes
a
as
ruth
hurried
up
the
stairs
to
get
her
cloak
she
met
marjorie
hasn
t
it
been
wonderful
she
whispered
yes
indeed
answered
marjorie
enthusiastically
and
ethel
is
taking
me
home
said
ruth
triumphantly
i
thought
she
would
want
to
take
you
she
seemed
so
struck
with
you
by
the
way
who
is
taking
you
she
asked
i
had
the
last
dance
with
frances
wright
and
she
offered
to
walk
over
with
phew
exclaimed
ruth
the
president
of
the
sophomore
class
and
a
φαβ
girl
besides
she
s
a
nice
girl
said
marjorie
simply
and
i
have
enjoyed
my
chapter
iv
the
stolen
meeting
the
spirit
of
rivalry
which
had
temporarily
given
way
to
one
of
courtesy
for
the
night
of
the
reception
returned
again
with
full
force
as
soon
as
the
party
was
over
although
no
regular
hazing
was
permitted
the
sophomores
usually
enjoyed
the
privilege
of
ordering
the
younger
girls
to
obey
their
commands
the
struggle
between
the
classes
lasted
only
six
weeks
and
might
be
ended
before
that
time
if
the
freshmen
succeeded
in
holding
a
class
meeting
within
that
period
and
electing
a
president
with
due
formality
all
the
conditions
regarding
the
conduct
of
the
meeting
were
printed
in
large
type
and
hung
on
the
principal
bulletin
boards
ruth
who
had
always
been
a
in
affairs
of
this
nature
took
particular
interest
in
the
event
she
had
discussed
it
many
times
with
evelyn
and
mae
but
neither
she
nor
in
fact
any
other
members
of
her
class
had
decided
upon
any
definite
action
about
a
week
after
the
sophomore
reception
she
paused
on
her
way
to
marjorie
s
room
to
read
the
notice
again
she
almost
knew
it
by
heart
nevertheless
she
read
it
over
again
carefully
to
see
that
she
had
missed
nothing
it
said
freshmen
please
note
the
following
rules
concerning
the
election
of
a
class
president
must
be
observed

meeting
must
be

time
after
the
opening

valid
a

up
such
a
meeting
if
the
freshman
class
fails
to
hold
said
meeting
within
the
alloted
time
a
committee
of
three
must
be
sent
to
the
sophomore
president
to
beg
on
bended
knees
for
permission
to
hold
their
ruth
closed
her
lips
tightly
resolving
to
do
something
and
to
do
it
immediately
she
hurried
to
marjorie
s
room
i
tell
you
our
class
is
as
slow
as
molasses
she
exclaimed
we
ve
got
to
do
something
about
our
marjorie
fingered
her
and
looked
questioningly
at
her
visitor
her
mind
was
still
on
forward
passes
and
she
did
not
quite
take
in
what
she
was
saying
there
s
no
hurry
is
there
she
asked
without
much
display
of
interest
isn
t
there
lots
of
time
yet
i
should
say
not
answered
ruth
crossly
two
weeks
have
gone
already
we
only
have
four
more
oh
four
weeks
is
an
age
i
wish
you
would
pay
more
attention
to
hockey
ruth
our
class
hasn
t
any
good
players
at
now
listen
marj
i
m
not
here
to
talk
about
hockey
i
m
going
to
do
something
about
electing
our
class
president
who
do
you
think
would
be
good
i
don
t
know
many
girls
very
well
who
do
think
why
how
about
yourself
marj
marjorie
scorned
the
idea
i
d
never
make
it
she
said
positively
besides
hockey
takes
all
my
ruth
hoped
that
marjorie
might
suggest
her
in
return
for
the
compliment
but
she
was
forced
to
leave
the
room
ungratified
she
received
more
encouragement
from
evelyn
however
i
mean
to
nominate
you
ruth
if
we
ever
get
the
meeting
said
her
friend
thanks
eve
then
i
ll
nominate
you
the
other
girl
laughed
what
fun
to
run
against
each
other
she
exclaimed
of
course
it
isn
t
only
the
honor
of
being
class
president
but
they
say
she
is
always
chosen
by
φαβ
they
couldn
t
afford
to
let
a
girl
like
that
go
by
ruth
rallied
her
forces
and
finally
succeeded
in
passing
word
around
that
all
the
freshmen
should
steal
into
the
assembly
room
as
soon
as
the
lights
went
off
the
following
night
which
was
saturday
marjorie
and
lily
did
not
pretend
to
undress
but
ruth
in
order
to
deceive
ethel
went
to
bed
as
usual
her
classmates
had
advised
her
not
to
make
any
attempt
to
attend
the
meeting
if
ethel
seemed
at
all
suspicious
they
reminded
her
that
eleven
girls
out
of
the
freshmen
could
be
absent
and
that
she
might
be
one
of
that
number
but
ruth
could
not
force
herself
to
lie
still
and
miss
everything
she
had
arranged
the
meeting
she
hoped
to
be
nominated
for
the
office
and
she
could
not
be
content
to
remain
away
accordingly
after
the
lights
were
out
and
she
and
ethel
were
both
in
bed
she
stirred
cautiously
and
looked
to
see
whether
her
were
awake
unfortunately
she
was
ethel
she
whispered
marjorie
had
a
headache
and
i
want
to
take
her
over
some
of
your
aspirin
pills
i
forgot
to
do
it
before
i
got
undressed
where
are
they
in
the
top
drawer
replied
her
sleepily
but
ruth
it
s
against
the
rules
to
go
off
the
floor
after
i
know
but
poor
marjorie
is
suffering
well
she
could
go
to
the
infirmary
the
night
nurse
would
take
care
of
but
i
promised
and
i
mean
to
stick
to
it
you
don
t
mind
ethel
watched
her
go
out
of
the
door
and
buried
her
head
again
in
her
pillow
the
night
was
rather
chilly
and
she
was
glad
she
did
not
have
to
creep
around
cold
corridors
suddenly
she
sat
up
in
bed
why
was
ruth
doing
this
she
wasn
t
usually
so
solicitous
about
marjorie
she
certainly
was
willing
to
slight
her
at
the
reception
the
previous
week
ethel
forgot
all
about
the
chilliness
of
the
night
and
her
own
sleepiness
she
put
on
her
shoes
and
stockings
and
reached
for
her
middy
and
skirt
then
seizing
a
sweater
she
rushed
up
to
frances
wright
s
door
on
the
third
floor
she
opened
her
friend
s
door
cautiously
wake
up
frances
she
said
it
s
ethel
i
think
the
freshmen
have
something
up
ruth
s
gone
frances
jumped
out
of
bed
where
she
asked
excitedly
i
don
t
know
you
better
blow
your
whistle
i
daren
t
at
night
it
s
against
the
ethel
gasped
well
then
hurry
she
said
i
ll
go
look
in
the
class
and
assembly
rooms
and
you
wake
up
the
other
squads
to
search
the
by
this
time
frances
was
already
dressed
and
the
girls
started
out
together
she
knocked
three
times
on
the
sophomores
doors
as
she
passed
thus
substituting
the
night
signal
in
place
of
the
whistle
she
used
in
the
day
time
the
freshmen
had
chosen
an
unfortunate
place
for
their
meeting
it
was
too
obvious
and
they
could
not
keep
down
their
voices
ruth
was
trying
to
count
the
girls
but
since
the
assembly
room
was
almost
perfectly
dark
she
found
this
a
difficult
thing
to
do
when
she
had
finally
ascertained
that
of
the
members
of
the
class
were
present
she
called
for
order
and
announced
nominations
are
in
order
they
are
not
cried
ethel
throwing
on
the
switch
the
freshmen
could
only
gasp
at
the
suddenness
of
the
interruption
and
the
light
the
spectacle
they
presented
with
their
hair
down
and
in
their
unconventional
clothing
contrasted
oddly
with
the
usual
dignity
of
assembly
room
audiences
ethel
laughed
out
loud
it
was
only
a
moment
before
the
light
attracted
a
crowd
of
sophomores
and
the
meeting
had
to
disband
just
as
the
girls
were
leaving
miss
allen
appeared
demanding
an
explanation
she
ordered
all
the
girls
back
to
their
rooms
and
warned
them
that
if
a
night
meeting
were
ever
attempted
again
the
practice
would
have
to
be
given
up
at
the
beginning
of
the
fourth
week
of
school
the
freshmen
made
another
attempt
to
hold
their
meeting
and
this
time
with
the
help
of
several
of
the
juniors
their
attempt
was
successful
edith
evans
an
upper
classman
stood
out
under
the
big
tree
on
the
campus
and
waved
a
white
handkerchief
which
the
freshmen
interpreted
as
a
summons
to
the
library
basement
secured
for
the
occasion
the
time
for
the
meeting
was
selected
at
an
hour
when
the
sophomores
were
on
the
hockey
field
edith
evans
counted
the
freshmen
as
they
entered
the
library
as
soon
as
there
were
she
went
inside
and
took
charge
of
the
nominations
doris
sands
the
prettiest
and
at
the
same
time
one
of
the
most
popular
girls
of
the
class
was
already
elected
president
when
ruth
and
evelyn
arrived
on
the
scene
who
were
nominated
asked
the
former
breathlessly
doris
sands
and
rita
wilds
of
course
doris
got
it
replied
the
freshman
she
had
questioned
she
d
get
it
no
matter
who
else
was
put
ruth
turned
away
hastily
for
she
could
not
keep
back
the
tears
evelyn
saw
her
disappointment
and
decided
to
leave
her
alone
but
before
she
had
reached
the
door
it
was
flung
open
and
half
a
dozen
sophomores
with
their
hockey
sticks
in
their
hands
rushed
in
too
late
cried
edith
triumphantly
the
freshmen
have
elected
doris
sands
for
their
president
a
groan
arose
from
the
defeated
girls
frances
wright
was
the
first
to
put
aside
the
class
antagonism
and
to
remember
her
manners
congratulations
doris
she
said
coming
forward
and
shaking
hands
by
this
time
ruth
had
control
of
herself
again
she
resolved
not
to
let
ethel
know
that
she
had
ever
hoped
for
the
office
she
found
her
among
the
group
around
doris
and
the
girls
walked
back
to
their
room
together
i
m
not
surprised
that
doris
was
elected
said
ethel
as
she
unlaced
her
hockey
shoes
i
always
thought
she
would
be
so
did
i
agreed
ruth
pleasantly
she
s
the
girl
we
all
wanted
from
the
first
chapter
v
the
sorority
party
five
weeks
of
school
had
gone
by
five
happy
weeks
filled
with
all
sorts
of
new
experiences
for
ruth
and
marjorie
the
day
to
which
every
freshman
looked
forward
was
only
one
week
off
although
the
φαβ
girls
had
singled
out
certain
individuals
as
their
favorites
by
inviting
them
for
walks
and
occasional
visits
to
their
rooms
they
had
as
yet
given
no
formal
party
for
which
invitations
had
been
issued
and
since
it
was
understood
that
such
a
party
was
an
event
to
be
expected
almost
every
girl
in
the
class
cherished
the
hope
of
finding
an
attractive
envelope
in
her
letter
box
very
soon
as
the
time
for
pledging
the
freshmen
drew
near
ruth
became
especially
uneasy
ethel
had
not
paid
much
attention
to
her
lately
and
she
lived
in
constant
dread
lest
she
should
not
be
included
among
the
guests
for
the
φαβ
party
an
omission
which
would
be
a
sure
indication
that
she
would
not
be
invited
to
join
the
sorority
but
marjorie
had
taken
little
interest
in
such
affairs
she
became
greatly
absorbed
in
athletics
she
bent
all
her
energy
toward
making
the
hockey
team
to
add
to
her
interest
in
athletics
she
became
infatuated
with
miss
phillips
the
a
young
woman
just
out
of
college
whose
clear
bright
eyes
and
pink
cheeks
radiated
health
she
seemed
indeed
a
living
example
of
the
wholesome
life
she
advocated
besides
this
miss
phillips
had
a
charm
all
her
own
she
inspired
the
girls
with
a
greater
love
of
athletics
than
they
would
otherwise
have
had
and
so
marjorie
after
the
first
two
or
three
days
had
not
given
much
thought
to
the
sorority
in
fact
she
had
even
neglected
her
chances
of
making
it
in
her
zeal
for
hockey
practice
once
or
twice
ethel
todd
had
come
to
her
room
to
ask
her
to
go
for
a
walk
but
she
had
refused
because
miss
phillips
expected
her
on
the
hockey
field
on
one
of
these
occasions
after
ethel
had
left
the
room
lily
looked
at
marjorie
as
if
she
could
not
understand
her
action
i
wish
i
had
your
chances
she
sighed
i
d
make
the
sorority
in
a
minute
you
d
be
better
off
if
you
made
the
hockey
team
remarked
marjorie
you
need
some
good
stiff
exercise
lily
i
know
you
think
i
m
too
fat
but
i
can
t
help
it
and
my
father
says
it
s
all
right
he
likes
fat
girls
you
eat
too
many
sweets
and
you
sit
inside
too
much
i
m
always
hoping
ethel
todd
or
frances
wright
will
come
for
me
to
take
a
walk
and
i
d
hate
to
miss
either
of
nonsense
exclaimed
marjorie
if
they
wanted
you
very
badly
they
d
make
it
a
point
to
come
when
you
re
here
don
t
bother
your
head
with
them
promise
me
you
ll
go
out
for
athletics
every
day
oh
i
couldn
t
do
that
lily
protested
marjorie
sighed
she
turned
toward
the
door
and
put
her
hand
on
the
knob
i
m
going
down
to
see
if
we
got
any
mail
she
remarked
as
she
turned
it
as
marjorie
looked
through
the
glass
door
of
her
box
she
saw
a
tiny
envelope
which
appeared
very
interesting
it
must
be
an
invitation
she
thought
as
she
excitedly
tore
open
the
paper
the
φαβ
sorority
requests
the
pleasure
of
miss
marjorie
wilkinson
s
presence
next
saturday
afternoon
at
at
the
home
of
walter
johnson
maple
avenue
to
johnson
marjorie
wrinkled
her
brows
what
can
this
mean
she
muttered
the
sorority
must
be
inviting
all
of
us
freshmen
so
they
can
give
us
a
last
looking
over
before
why
i
believe
that
comes
next
week
as
she
walked
slowly
out
of
the
school
she
met
ruth
entering
hastily
hulloa
greeted
ruth
wait
a
minute
marj
i
ll
walk
with
she
found
a
similar
envelope
in
her
box
and
opened
it
she
said
nothing
about
its
contents
to
marjorie
but
looked
happy
and
mysterious
i
suppose
you
got
an
invitation
for
saturday
afternoon
marjorie
asked
ruth
opened
her
mouth
in
surprise
yes
did
you
yes
i
wondered
if
the
φαβ
girls
were
inviting
the
whole
freshman
ruth
looked
scared
oh
it
couldn
t
be
that
she
exclaimed
then
suddenly
her
face
brightened
lily
didn
t
get
an
invitation
in
your
did
she
no
answered
marjorie
mine
was
the
only
letter
ruth
smiled
happily
i
m
so
excited
marj
she
said
putting
her
arm
around
the
other
girl
s
waist
wouldn
t
it
be
great
if
we
d
both
make
it
yes
said
marjorie
doubtfully
as
if
she
saw
little
hope
of
such
a
possibility
of
course
you
will
but
i
don
t
believe
i
shall
they
don
t
know
me
they
must
have
invited
more
than
four
girls
to
their
party
then
they
will
pick
out
the
ones
they
want
and
ask
them
for
next
let
s
go
see
if
we
can
find
out
who
else
got
invitations
suggested
ruth
arm
in
arm
the
girls
walked
down
the
path
in
front
of
the
school
it
was
a
beautiful
bright
day
in
october
and
they
both
felt
very
happy
marjorie
more
so
because
she
was
with
her
old
friend
ruth
than
because
she
had
been
invited
to
the
φαβ
party
after
they
had
walked
about
five
minutes
they
met
evelyn
doris
and
mae
who
stopped
to
chat
the
bids
are
out
said
mae
excitedly
of
course
you
got
one
yes
answered
ruth
doris
looked
embarrassed
in
truth
she
was
afraid
marjorie
had
not
and
she
did
not
want
to
hurt
her
feelings
but
ruth
continued
marjorie
and
i
each
got
one
i
suppose
all
you
girls
got
them
too
yes
yes
they
answered
isn
t
that
funny
said
mae
could
it
be
that
they
intend
to
ask
five
freshmen
to
join
instead
of
four
no
replied
doris
they
have
invited
more
girls
this
week
than
will
get
the
final
bids
next
week
i
was
just
talking
to
anna
cane
the
new
girl
who
arrived
here
lately
from
that
california
seminary
and
she
told
me
she
was
invited
poor
girl
she
s
awfully
innocent
she
doesn
t
understand
a
bit
about
secret
societies
they
didn
t
have
any
in
the
she
came
from
i
really
think
we
ought
to
coach
her
let
her
look
out
for
herself
said
ruth
we
didn
t
have
anybody
to
help
us
did
we
no
i
guess
not
admitted
doris
it
all
seems
silly
exclaimed
marjorie
if
i
ever
did
get
invited
to
join
it
i
d
try
to
change
it
into
something
with
honor
attached
to
it
why
as
it
is
it
s
merely
chance
whether
you
get
invited
or
no
it
isn
t
said
evelyn
the
girls
know
who
they
let
s
walk
said
marjorie
i
want
to
sign
up
an
hour
s
what
seems
so
foolish
to
me
she
continued
is
that
you
daren
t
mention
it
to
the
girls
who
are
in
it
now
if
you
four
girls
are
asked
to
join
and
i
m
not
i
will
never
dare
talk
about
the
sorority
to
that
makes
it
all
the
more
fun
said
ruth
perhaps
for
those
in
it
but
think
of
the
dozens
of
girls
like
lily
who
are
just
eating
their
hearts
out
because
they
aren
t
asked
and
never
would
what
kind
of
society
would
have
asked
doris
diplomatically
well
i
d
have
one
that
only
takes
in
the
girl
first
she
d
have
to
be
excellent
in
her
studies
then
good
in
athletics
and
finally
generally
popular
then
if
the
society
did
interesting
things
like
take
hikes
and
study
nature
and
and
maybe
go
camping
in
the
summer
it
would
be
ruth
laughed
i
m
glad
you
aren
t
the
boss
marj
i
guess
i
wouldn
t
have
much
chance
of
making
meeting
one
or
two
other
freshmen
who
joined
the
group
the
girls
dropped
the
subject
saturday
dawned
clear
and
mild
the
freshmen
decided
to
go
together
and
met
downstairs
near
the
big
lamp
in
the
hall
marjorie
was
the
last
to
arrive
the
girls
were
all
dressed
simply
and
in
good
taste
in
summer
dresses
and
light
sweaters
it
was
so
warm
that
no
one
wore
a
hat
marjorie
alone
wore
a
dark
dress
a
becoming
brown
which
made
her
look
tall
and
slender
her
hair
was
arranged
in
a
long
plait
none
of
the
freshmen
wore
theirs
up
yet
and
her
brown
eyes
looked
especially
soft
and
beautiful
the
six
girls
were
in
high
spirits
marjorie
who
did
not
expect
to
be
invited
to
join
and
anna
who
did
not
know
anything
about
each
thought
it
was
lovely
to
be
included
doris
ruth
evelyn
and
mae
were
each
secretly
sure
of
being
one
of
the
lucky
four
but
nevertheless
were
nervously
the
house
where
the
party
was
held
was
decorated
with
chrysanthemums
and
brightly
colored
autumn
leaves
and
although
the
day
was
rather
mild
a
cheerful
fire
was
burning
in
the
fireplace
to
dispel
any
indication
of
dampness
ethel
todd
and
frances
wright
two
of
the
sophomores
received
the
girls
and
introduced
them
to
the
hostess
and
the
other
members
of
the
alumnæ
who
were
present
there
were
tables
containing
miscellaneous
games
for
a
progressive
salmigundi
and
the
victrola
was
playing
a
waltz
the
girls
took
seats
together
on
the
sofa
in
the
corner
here
said
the
hostess
standing
before
them
this
won
t
do
you
freshmen
are
the
guests
of
honor
each
one
of
you
is
to
sit
at
a
separate
table
and
get
the
freshmen
scattered
the
hostess
rang
a
bell
and
the
games
began
marjorie
sat
at
a
table
where
the
girls
speared
peanuts
in
a
bowl
with
hatpins
ruth
at
the
table
next
was
endeavoring
to
pick
up
dried
beans
with
two
skewers
the
games
were
so
ridiculous
that
soon
everyone
was
laughing
and
feeling
at
ease
after
the
girls
had
progressed
all
around
the
room
the
bell
was
rung
and
the
score
cards
collected
marjorie
was
surprised
to
be
awarded
the
prize
a
beautiful
bunch
of
violets
you
certainly
are
smart
said
ethel
to
get
all
those
no
said
marjorie
i
m
just
lucky
i
love
games
i
guess
that
is
why
i
m
so
crazy
about
but
maybe
the
gym
teacher
has
something
to
do
with
that
teased
ruth
after
refreshments
were
served
the
girls
sang
some
school
songs
and
a
few
danced
together
out
in
the
spacious
hall
before
they
realized
it
the
clock
struck
five
oh
i
must
go
exclaimed
marjorie
lily
will
be
wondering
what
has
become
of
lily
said
ruth
contemptuously
you
don
t
mean
to
say
you
bother
with
her
why
yes
of
course
she
s
my
such
a
girl
i
never
could
be
nice
to
her
nobody
likes
the
freshmen
thanked
their
hostess
for
the
lovely
time
and
walked
back
together
wasn
t
it
perfect
exclaimed
marjorie
oh

asked
to

said
ruth
with
a
sigh
join
what
asked
anna
doris
explained
all
about
the
sorority
and
anna
listened
in
amazement
well
i
ll
never
be
asked
she
said

m
terribly
fresh
because
i
guess
i
often
asked
questions
that
are
tabooed
would
you
apologize
no
replied
doris
just
wait
i
think
the
girls
at
that
moment
miss
phillips
passed
and
already
marjorie
had
forgotten
sororities
in
her
interest
in
the
morrow
s
hockey
game
chapter
vi
when
marjorie

she
found

she
sobbed
and
i
ve
been
so
i
m

said
marjorie

lily
raised
her

from

pillow
i

t

tell
me
and
it
isn
t
a
secret

marjorie
began
to
tell
about
their
good
time
suddenly
she
stopped
and
looked
hastily
at
her
watch

i
loathe
miss
phillips
every
time

her
she
says
something
about
chocolate
éclairs

well

said
i

about
the
party
after

paused
and
unpinned

bunch
of
violets

she
said
as
she
divided
them
they

marjorie
said
lily
smiling
again

t
leave
me
long
and
oh
marjorie
if
you

the
sorority
promise
to
help

me
in
i

t
do
that
dear
they

four
girls
from
each
class
and
there
wouldn
t
be
a
vacancy
unless

or

the
then

less
candy
and

she
answered
i
will
i
will
honestly
said
lily
earnestly
marjorie
stooped
and
kissed
her
i
don
t
think
i
ll
make
the
sorority
but
if
i
should
it
wouldn
t
make
any
difference
between
us
she
said
lily
has
improved
thought
marjorie
as
she
walked
down
the
hall
but
there
s
room
for
a
lot
more
if
only
she
wouldn
t
think
so
much
about
herself
if
girls
would
go
in
hard
for
athletics
when
they
re
blue
or
morbid
they
d
soon
get
over
at
the
corner
she
met
ethel
todd
just
as
ethel
was
about
to
say
something
miss
phillips
hurried
up
to
her
marjorie
wilkinson
she
said
can
you
come
to
my
table
to
talk
over
the
hockey
team
this
evening
ethel
s
face
fell
oh
i
was
just
going
to
invite
marjorie
to
our
table
i
got
miss
allen
s
permission
can
t
she
go
with
you
some
other
time
but
marjorie
turned
to
ethel
and
shook
her
head
her
eyes
sparkled
with
excitement
as
she
glanced
again
at
miss
phillips
thanks
awfully
ethel
she
said
but
you
see
if
i
don
t
go
with
miss
phillips
it
will
be
too
late
to
discuss
the
team
and
besides
she
added
smiling
it
s
such
an
honor
to
be
invited
by
a
teacher
miss
phillips
beamed
i
admire
your
pluck
marjorie
she
said
after
ethel
had
gone
off
there
aren
t
many
girls
who
would
turn
down
an
φαβ
girl
for
a
teacher
but
i
like
the
teacher
better
she
said
shyly
as
she
slipped
her
arm
into
miss
phillips
s
and
walked
with
her
into
the
the
next
day
was
set
aside
for
the
freshman
picnic
miss
phillips
and
miss
landis
the
chaperones
guided
the
girls
along
a
winding
path
which
led
into
a
deep
pine
woods
what
a
wonderful
place
cried
marjorie
yes
agreed
miss
phillips
enthusiastically
and
the
beauty
of
it
is
that
it
s
just
as
nice
in
winter
as
at
any
other
time
because
it
is
always
secluded
from
the
wind
and
the
trees
never
i
am
going
to
make
a
map
of
it
said
marjorie
my
brother
showed
me
how
the
boy
scouts
make
ruth
looked
scornful
marjorie
you
are
interested
in
such
queer
things
she
said
mae
was
standing
beside
ruth
girls
she
said
to
ruth
and
marjorie
in
a
low
tone
our
crowd
is
over
here
under
the
trees
we
re
going
to
eat
together
will
you
both
come
marjorie
was
rather
surprised
to
be
included
in
what
mae
had
designated
as
our
crowd
but
she
was
very
glad
to
be
with
ruth
they
all
walked
over
to
the
spot
indicated
by
mae
and
found
evelyn
doris
and
anna
untying
packages
of
lunch
ruth
became
very
gay
girls
she
said
i
feel
that
we
ought
to
stick
together
for
this
is
our
last
chance
of
course
is
and
by
supper
time
we
ll
be
divided
and
two
of
us
will
be
left
out
of
the
crowd
so
let
s
be
friends
as
long
as
we
can
surely
you
don
t
mean
that
do
you
ruth
asked
anna
why
can
t
we
keep
on
all
being
friends
even
if
four
of
you
are
pledged
to
φαβ
and
two
of
us
are
not
anna
certainly
is
modest
exclaimed
evelyn
she
includes
herself
amongst
those
left
anna
blushed
i
never
have
expected
to
make
the
sorority
she
said
ever
since
doris
told
me
about
it
but
i
don
t
see
why
i
should
lose
all
your
friendships
for
that
of
course
not
said
marjorie
emphatically
let
s
be
sensible
we
re
too
good
friends
for
that
why
that
would
mean
a
sorority
girl
could
have
only
three
friends
in
her
own
let
s
promise
to
go
on
just
as
we
are
said
doris
sweetly
and
if
we
don
t
make
it
ourselves
be
glad
for
the
ones
that
that
s
easy
for
you
to
say
snapped
evelyn
you
re
president
of
the
class
and
you
know
she
s
always
chosen
mae
changed
the
subject
does
anyone
know
how
they
make
the
bids
she
asked
yes
i
do
said
ruth
one
of
the
girls
from
home
who
went
here
told
me
you
see
s
saturday
and
so
after
lunch
if
it
s
a
nice
day
the
girls
usually
go
for
a
walk
in
the
garden
of
course
you
don
t
have
to
you
can
stay
in
your
room
if
you
like
well
anyway
the
φαβ
girls
meet
in
the
room
of
one
of
the
senior
or
junior
members
at
two
o
clock
and
begin
to
vote
they
say
sometimes
they
have
an
awful
lot
of
voting
i
guess
like
the
primary
elections
my
father
tells
about
because
each
new
member
has
to
be
elected
unanimously
so
they
often
vote
over
and
over
again
then
as
soon
as
they
have
decided
on
the
candidates
the
four
sophomores
are
each
sent
to
get
a
freshman
who
has
been
voted
my
goodness
how
exciting
exclaimed
anna
i
don
t
think
though
continued
ruth
that
a
girl
usually
stays
out
in
the
garden
unless
she
either
is
sure
of
being
asked
or
of
not
being
what
do
you
mean
asked
doris
well
of
course
you
doris
would
go
out
in
the
garden
because
everybody
knows
you
ll
be
asked
and
lily
andrews
for
instance
could
go
out
because
nobody
expects
her
to
be
invited
but
all
doubtful
people
like
marjorie
and
anna
and
me
why
we
d
feel
humiliated
if
we
were
out
there
and
weren
t
taken
so
i
for
one
am
going
to
stay
in
my
oh
but
i
want
to
see
the
fun
objected
marjorie
and
i
sha
n
t
mind
not
being
marjorie
wilkinson
exclaimed
ruth
you
know
that
is
not
the
truth
you
re
just
dying
to
write
home
and
say
you
are
an
φαβ
pledge
maybe
i
am
admitted
marjorie
am
what
inquired
lily
approaching
the
group
in
search
of
her
am
full
laughed
marjorie
i
can
t
stuff
another
sit
down
lily
said
doris
politely
we
want
to
talk
over
the
freshman
hockey
lily
did
as
she
was
requested
and
the
girls
chatted
gaily
until
miss
phillips
announced
that
it
was
time
to
pack
up
the
next
day
was
one
of
great
excitement
freshmen
girls
were
eagerly
waiting
to
see
who
would
be
the
lucky
four
naturally
everyone
expected
the
candidates
to
be
chosen
from
the
six
who
had
been
invited
to
the
party
but
every
girl
cherished
in
her
heart
the
hope
of
a
joyful
surprise
once
it
was
whispered
a
girl
whom
no
one
had
thought
of
had
been
asked
why
not
again
marjorie
was
secretly
excited
but
she
did
not
admit
it
after
lunch
instead
of
walking
on
the
campus
she
went
over
to
the
gym
to
miss
phillips
s
office
where
she
could
watch
proceedings
out
of
the
window
and
at
the
same
time
help
her
favorite
teacher
with
some
work
ruth
went
up
to
her
own
room
and
tried
to
write
letters
doris
mae
and
anna
strolled
out
in
the
garden
and
evelyn
went
to
the
library
to
read
lily
looked
in
vain
for
marjorie
and
finally
went
up
to
her
room
and
sat
where
she
could
see
the
door
listening
for
every
step
the
clock
on
the
library
door
chimed
two
nothing
had
happened
except
that
all
the
sorority
girls
were
missing
the
groups
of
girls
on
the
campus
began
to
come
closer
together
to
center
around
the
side
porch
the
clock
chimed
quarter
of
the
hour
still
nothing
happened
the
girls
kept
walking
closer
and
closer
one
or
two
girls
tired
of
waiting
went
into
the
house
then
just
as
the
clock
struck
three
frances
wright
the
sophomore
president
opened
the
side
door
and
came
out
on
the
porch
the
groups
all
stopped
breathless
then
they
tried
not
to
watch
to
look
unconcerned
and
to
talk
naturally
though
everybody
was
pretty
sure
they
knew
where
frances
was
headed
looking
straight
ahead
she
walked
down
the
porch
steps
across
the
path
and
over
to
the
big
elm
where
doris
mae
and
anna
were
sitting
on
the
seat
around
the
tree
with
only
a
word
from
frances
doris
rose
and
took
the
arm
she
extended
and
both
girls
disappeared
into
the
house
everybody
drew
a
deep
breath
and
began
to
talk
excitedly
anna
and
mae
were
trembling
let
s
join
those
freshmen
over
there
suggested
anna
suppose
you
were
taken
i
d
be
left
sitting
here
alone
and
i
d
feel
so
funny
all
right
agreed
mae
but
before
they
had
put
their
words
into
action
marian
guard
and
lulu
davids
two
other
sophomore
φαβs
came
out
of
the
building
and
walked
directly
towards
them
they
went
through
the
same
proceeding
as
frances
and
anna
and
mae
accompanied
them
back
into
the
house
excitement
now
ran
high
who
was
to
be
the
fourth
girl
undoubtedly
ruth
henry
where
was
she
everybody
looked
around
but
she
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
of
course
she
s
in
her
room
said
one
freshman
and
ethel
todd
s
the
only
sophomore
left
so
she
ll
go
there
to
get
her
and
we
ll
miss
seeing
it
i
call
that
mean
by
quarter
after
three
the
crowd
became
restless
and
presuming
that
ruth
had
been
asked
from
her
room
they
started
to
move
towards
the
door
suddenly
it
opened
and
ethel
todd
appeared
passing
the
groups
almost
as
if
she
saw
no
one
she
followed
the
path
to
the
gym
the
girls
watched
her
open
the
door
and
disappear
and
in
a
minute
she
reappeared
with
marjorie
wilkinson
chapter
vii
outsiders
when
quarter
after
three
came
and
ethel
had
not
come
to
the
room
for
ruth
she
thought
there
must
be
something
wrong
it
may
take
longer
than
they
expected
she
kept
telling
herself
over
and
over
as
she
tried
to
fasten
her
attention
on
the
letter
she
was
writing
to
her
aunt
then
gradually
she
became
aware
of
a
stir
outside
the
door
the
girls
were
returning
in
groups
she
could
hear
their
footsteps
and
even
their
voices
plainly
for
she
had
left
the
door
open
a
crack
to
hear
ethel
s
step
in
case
she
should
come
and
then
the
realization
came
over
her
that
it
was
all
over
and
that
she
had
not
been
asked
could
it
be
true
ruth
suddenly
felt
weak
nothing
mattered
now
how
would
she
ever
tell
the
folks
at
home
she
had
written
so
much
about
the
girls
and
the
sorority
she
would
be
ashamed
to
tell
them
she
had
lost
out
at
that
moment
she
heard
a
group
of
girls
stop
in
front
of
the
door
next
to
hers
and
the
freshman
who
lived
there
and
who
had
been
lying
down
all
afternoon
with
a
sick
headache
came
out
into
the
hall
who
were
asked
ruth
heard
her
inquire
and
then
she
listened
to
the
names
names
among
which
hers
was
not
included
her
head
positively
swam
as
the
other
freshman
answered
doris
sands
anna
cane
mae
vanhorn
and
marjorie
wilkinson
ruth
did
not
listen
to
the
description
of
the
proceedings
that
followed
marjorie
wilkinson
she
muttered
and
buried
her
face
in
the
sofa
pillow
and
wept
in
lily
andrews
s
room
a
similar
scene
was
taking
place
she
had
retired
there
soon
after
lunch
with
a
magazine
and
her
box
of
chocolates
and
had
left
the
door
open
and
waited
once
or
twice
she
had
perched
herself
upon
the
window
sill
to
watch
developments
in
the
garden
and
at
one
of
these
times
she
had
witnessed
frances
wright
approach
and
claim
doris
sands
then
she
had
gone
back
to
her
chair
and
waited
in
about
fifteen
minutes
she
thought
she
was
rewarded
her
heart
beat
fast
as
she
heard
footsteps
approach
her
door
and
stop
then
a
knock
sounded
on
the
door
trembling
she
answered
come
it
was
ethel
todd
but
lily
s
hopes
were
to
fall
as
quickly
as
they
had
arisen
ethel
apologized
for
the
interruption
i
m
sorry
to
bother
you
lily
but
can
you
tell
me
where
to
find
marjorie
yes
she
must
have
gone
over
to
the
gym
to
help
miss
phillips
make
out
her
ethel
thanked
her
and
went
out
lily
like
ruth
wept
but
there
was
no
bitterness
in
her
tears
only
disappointment
if
i
couldn
t
make
it
myself
she
sobbed
i
d
rather
have
marjorie
get
it
than
any
other
meanwhile
the
four
freshmen
were
taken
into
the
senior
member
s
room
where
absolute
darkness
prevailed
they
were
commanded
to
sit
upon
the
floor
and
sat
down
on
something
very
soft
which
they
afterwards
discovered
to
be
flour
in
a
hollow
voice
one
of
the
juniors
read
proclamation
of
the
φαβ
sorority
october
be
it
understood
that
doris
sands
anna
cane
mae
vanhorn
and
marjorie
wilkinson
are
hereby
pledged
as
members
of
the
φαβ
sorority
they
must
submit
themselves
to
all
rules
of
the
sorority
and
keep
everything
absolutely
secret
if
they
comply
with
these
terms
they
shall
in
three
weeks
time
be
initiated
as
regular
members
will
you
hereby
sign
your
acceptance
of
these
terms
the
freshmen
were
handed
a
large
book
each
girl
signed
and
a
seal
was
made
after
her
name
then
they
were
blindfolded
and
put
through
two
or
three
initiation
stunts
by
four
o
clock
the
proceedings
were
over
and
refreshments
were
served
each
girl
was
presented
with
a
tiny
silver
which
she
wore
on
the
left
side
of
her
shirtwaist
when
all
was
over
marjorie
went
back
to
her
room
almost
dazed
it
seemed
impossible
that
she
could
not
go
tell
ruth
about
it
why
ruth
hadn
t
made
it
she
must
be
unhappy
and
poor
lily
surely
she
didn
t
expect
to
make
it
and
yet
well
she
would
do
her
best
to
console
her
she
was
hardly
inside
the
room
and
had
just
noticed
lily
lying
on
her
couch
in
tears
when
mae
vanhorn
ran
up
to
her
oh
marjorie
she
said
do
come
out
for
a
walk
with
me
i
m
simply
dying
to
talk
it
over
with
somebody
besides
i
have
to
get
away
from
my
mae
roomed
with
evelyn
she
s
so
blue
i
can
t
stand
her
company
marjorie
glanced
at
lily
thanks
mae
she
said
but
i
can
t
leave
lily
she
s
been
alone
all
mae
pouted
and
stood
still
marjorie
she
said
why
couldn
t
you
and
i
fix
it
up
to
room
together
evelyn
and
lily
might
as
well
be
lily
looked
up
frightened
evelyn
hopkins
had
treated
her
more
rudely
than
any
other
girl
in
the
school
with
the
possible
exception
of
ruth
so
the
prospect
was
not
a
pleasant
one
for
her
but
marjorie
shook
her
head
thank
you
mae
she
said
but
i
want
to
stay
with
lily
jumped
up
marjorie
she
said
between
her
sobs
if
you
want
to
room
with
mae
you
do
it
i
ll
manage
somehow
marjorie
went
over
and
put
her
arm
around
her
no
dear
she
said
i
don
t
want
to
room
with
anybody
but
you
now
mae
won
t
you
sit
down
no
i
think
i
ll
go
look
for
doris
answered
marjorie
i
m
so
glad
you
made
it
marjorie
said
lily
drying
her
eyes
thank
you
lily
i
really
believe
you
are
and
it
makes
it
ever
so
much
nicer
for
me
but
i
want
you
to
know
that
except
for
the
meetings
and
parties
i
m
never
going
to
leave
you
for
the
sorority
they
talked
for
a
while
going
over
the
events
of
the
afternoon
lily
started
to
dress
for
supper
suddenly
turning
to
marjorie
she
said
i
ve
made
a
new
resolution
from
on
i
give
up
candy
and
sweets
between
meals
and
i
m
going
to
practice
for
on
the
team
do
you
think
there
s
any
chance
of
my
making
it
splendid
exclaimed
her
yes
there
is
no
one
to
substitute
for
mildred
warren
in
case
she
gets
sick
and
lily
couldn
t
you
go
out
for
swimming
each
class
is
supposed
to
have
six
girls
on
the
team
and
positively
our
class
is
awful
yes
i
ll
try
said
lily
but
i
don
t
believe
i
could
ever
learn
to
of
course
you
could
said
marjorie
and
the
two
girls
linked
arms
and
went
down
into
the
together
after
supper
lily
went
over
to
another
freshman
s
room
to
study
french
so
marjorie
slipped
out
and
went
to
see
ruth
she
found
her
alone
hulloa
said
ruth
unenthusiastically
won
t
you
sit
down
thanks
said
marjorie
accepting
her
invitation
they
discussed
lessons
and
hockey
and
finally
ruth
came
to
the
topic
that
was
uppermost
in
both
their
minds
how
does
it
feel
to
be
an
φαβ
she
asked
i
m
not
what
asked
ruth
excitedly
a
vain
hope
that
marjorie
had
turned
down
her
bid
ran
through
her
mind
i
m
only
pledged
said
marjorie
we
re
not
going
to
be
taken
in
till
just
before
thanksgiving
lots
of
things
might
happen
between
then
and
have
you
written
home
yet
no
of
course
not
there
hasn
t
been
i
should
think
you
would
have
written
the
minute
you
got
back
to
your
no
there
was
too
much
to
explain
i
never
told
the
family
much
about
the
sorority
because
i
didn
t
expect
to
make
it
i
wish
i
hadn
t
told
them
so
much
sighed
ruth
they
won
t
understand
why
i
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
don
t
either
ruth
why
they
ever
decided
on
me
instead
of
you
or
evelyn
is
a
mystery
to
me
it
was
your
indifference
marjorie
they
had
to
run
after
you
it
was
a
clever
stroke
on
your
marjorie
flushed
angrily
clever
stroke
she
exclaimed
i
never
thought
a
thing
about
it
i
was
too
crazy
about
hockey
and
miss
phillips
well
now
i
suppose
you
won
t
care
to
keep
up
our
old
friendship
said
ruth
i
just
told
lily
and
i
ll
tell
you
it
won
t
make
one
bit
of
difference
between
my
friends
and
me
because
i
belong
to
the
ruth
drew
herself
up
proudly
you
needn
t
class
me
with
lily
andrews
and
go
with
me
out
of
pity
i
won
t
stand
for
that
don
t
ruth
please
but
i
do
care
for
lily
for
her
own
sake
she
s
going
to
make
a
dandy
girl
only
her
parents
have
brought
her
up
all
wrong
when
she
begins
to
lose
some
of
her
laziness
and
dress
decently
and
be
interested
in
something
besides
herself
and
her
father
s
money
why
you
ll
see
that
there
s
really
a
lot
to
lily
she
s
so
loyal
and
so
affectionate
i
suppose
you
ll
be
trying
to
get
her
into
φαβ
jeered
ruth
you
know
i
can
t
do
that
the
charter
limits
the
membership
to
four
in
each
i
wish
i
could
start
a
rival
club
observed
ruth
you
can
t
said
marjorie
because
the
faculty
have
set
their
foot
down
against
any
more
secret
i
always
thought
you
didn
t
approve
of
them
at
all
marj
this
was
said
with
a
malicious
little
twinkle
in
her
eyes
i
hardly
think
i
do
but
i
can
t
tell
yet
wait
till
we
ve
been
here
a
year
or
two
and
have
had
a
chance
to
observe
marjorie
rose
to
go
it
s
time
to
study
she
said
i
just
wanted
to
run
in
and
see
you
for
a
little
while
ruth
she
lowered
her
voice
please
don
t
be
discouraged
there
s
a
great
deal
more
to
school
than
being
a
sorority
member
ruth
turned
away
i
tell
you
i
don
t
want
your
sympathy
i
ll
never
mention
it
again
agreed
the
other
as
she
stood
with
her
hand
on
the
door
and
ruth
i
ll
look
for
you
at
good
night
good
night
mumbled
ruth
chapter
viii
the
hockey
match
three
weeks
had
passed
by
and
the
girls
were
making
preparations
to
return
to
their
homes
for
the
thanksgiving
holidays
the
whole
school
however
looked
forward
to
the
big
hockey
match
with
miss
martin
s
seminary
which
was
to
be
held
the
last
saturday
before
vacation
after
the
game
there
was
to
be
a
reception
to
the
teams
and
to
the
visitors
from
the
other
school
ruth
regretted
that
she
had
not
gone
out
for
athletics
from
the
first
it
was
too
late
now
to
try
to
make
any
position
on
the
hockey
team
now
that
class
affairs
had
quieted
down
and
there
was
no
longer
a
possibility
of
being
chosen
for
the
sorority
she
was
forced
to
lose
her
place
in
the
foreground
of
the
school
affairs
a
situation
entirely
distasteful
to
such
an
ambitious
girl
as
ruth
she
turned
the
matter
over
and
over
in
her
mind
but
she
did
not
see
what
she
could
do
to
alter
her
position
she
had
been
too
proud
to
write
much
about
her
personal
feelings
to
her
mother
she
preferred
to
try
to
work
out
the
problem
by
herself
nor
had
marjorie
s
expectations
been
realized
she
was
not
so
happy
after
she
was
pledged
to
the
sorority
as
she
had
hoped
to
be
she
lived
in
too
much
of
a
rush
she
seemed
to
race
from
to
teas
and
and
to
be
obliged
to
stay
up
late
at
night
to
finish
her
lessons
this
of
course
was
not
allowed
the
lights
were
turned
off
at
ten
o
clock
but
she
lighted
three
or
four
candles
and
put
a
raised
umbrella
between
lily
s
cot
and
the
light
and
but
all
her
lessons
and
especially
her
latin
suffered
she
had
been
chosen
for
one
of
the
forwards
on
the
school
hockey
team
lily
strange
to
say
had
been
appointed
substitute
a
position
usually
taken
by
girls
of
the
heavier
type
she
had
resolutely
kept
her
word
and
had
gone
in
training
ever
since
she
had
made
her
promise
to
marjorie
and
because
were
scarce
and
lily
did
fairly
well
and
much
to
her
surprise
she
had
been
chosen
she
had
no
idea
of
playing
in
the
game
with
miss
martin
s
but
miss
phillips
had
told
her
to
come
out
dressed
for
action
in
case
she
should
be
needed
most
of
the
other
members
of
the
team
were
upper
classmen
and
a
few
of
them
sorority
members
on
one
occasion
during
practice
miss
phillips
showed
herself
particularly
cross
with
the
sorority
girls
for
a
round
of
parties
had
left
them
tired
out
and
with
little
energy
for
practice
i
wish
we
could
abolish
that
sorority
she
remarked
to
miss
landis
after
the
practice
marjorie
wilkinson
isn
t
the
girl
she
was
before
she
was
asked
she
hasn
t
much
time
for
athletics
i
don
t
believe
she
ll
even
go
out
for
the
swimming
i
certainly
agree
with
you
about
the
sorority
replied
miss
landis
the
freshmen
couldn
t
settle
down
to
work
on
their
lessons
till
after
the
first
six
weeks
of
excitement
were
over
and
then
it
was
too
late
i
wish
there
could
be
some
sort
of
standard
mark
a
girl
had
to
make
and
to
belong
to
the
it
would
be
a
good
plan
but
it
s
too
late
to
introduce
changes
now
the
thing
will
go
on
forever
as
it
is
because
it
can
only
be
changed
by
a
majority
vote
from
within
or
by
the
agreement
of
the
whole
board
and
neither
of
these
will
ever
give
lily
andrews
certainly
has
improved
hasn
t
she
remarked
miss
landis
compare
the
change
in
her
with
that
in
marjorie
why
that
would
be
the
strongest
argument
anybody
could
make
against
sororities
the
saturday
before
the
thanksgiving
holidays
arrived
bright
clear
and
cold
lily
was
up
early
come
on
marj
she
cried
wake
up
it
s
the
day
of
the
i
m
so
sleepy
pleaded
marjorie
let
me
sleep
ten
minutes
but
you
ll
be
late
for
breakfast
i
don
t
care
after
five
minutes
lily
made
another
attack
the
other
girl
roused
herself
slowly
and
rubbed
her
eyes
oh
why
did
i
go
to
that
last
night
at
mae
s
i
know
i
ll
play
a
bum
game
i
hope
not
said
lily
pleasantly
but
you
ought
to
follow
the
advice
you
are
always
giving
me
you
re
a
regular
member
of
the
team
and
i
m
only
a
substitute
oh
don
t
you
hope
we
beat
i
know
a
girl
who
goes
to
miss
martin
s
and
i
d
feel
so
badly
if
her
school
beat
i
guess
we
ll
win
said
marjorie
calmly
our
team
s
pretty
when
afternoon
came
the
regular
team
and
the
substitutes
met
in
miss
phillips
s
office
for
some
final
coaching
the
girls
themselves
were
confident
of
success
but
the
teacher
was
doubtful
the
benches
down
on
the
field
were
already
filled
with
girls
in
sweaters
and
fur
coats
and
caps
miss
martin
s
girls
arrived
not
only
the
team
but
the
whole
school
and
announced
themselves
with
a
rousing
yell
for
miss
allen
miss
phillips
brought
her
team
down
to
the
field
and
the
opponents
were
introduced
the
substitutes
sat
on
a
special
bench
reserved
for
them
the
whistle
blew
and
the
game
began
at
first
it
was
hotly
contested
for
several
minutes
the
ball
stayed
near
the
center
of
the
field
at
the
end
of
five
minutes
miss
martin
s
girls
got
control
of
it
sent
it
through
the
on
past
the
into
the
goal
there
was
a
great
shout
from
the
audience
the
remainder
of
the
half
passed
without
either
side
s
scoring
when
miss
phillips
blew
the
whistle
for
time
the
girls
stopped
exhausted
and
mildred
warren
the
for
whom
lily
was
to
substitute
announced
that
she
was
played
out
i
couldn
t
play
the
next
half
she
said
if
my
life
depended
upon
so
miss
phillips
called
lily
to
take
her
place
as
the
girls
grouped
around
her
for
final
instructions
the
teacher
showed
by
her
voice
that
she
was
vexed
you
re
not
getting
into
it
girls
marjorie
wilkinson
you
act
as
if
you
were
half
asleep
and
margaret
and
elsie
she
said
addressing
two
of
the
you
never
should
have
let
that
ball
slip
through
now
brace
up
and
win
this
half
the
game
started
but
with
little
more
promise
of
success
finally
marjorie
got
the
ball
and
started
down
the
field
but
she
was
attacked
by
the
opposing
forward
who
sent
the
ball
flying
past
marjorie
and
past
the
but
lily
andrews
was
on
the
alert
with
all
her
might
she
hit
the
ball
and
sent
it
back
to
her
forwards
everyone
clapped
a
yell
for
lily
andrews
called
the
cheerleader
and
a
hearty
one
was
given
but
the
forward
who
was
playing
against
marjorie
on
the
opposing
team
was
not
to
be
easily
daunted
she
succeeded
in
getting
the
ball
again
and
this
time
she
aimed
it
towards
the
other
side
of
the
field
from
that
on
which
lily
was
playing
she
sent
it
past
the
other
and
into
the
goal
miss
martin
s
girls
rose
in
a
body
and
cheered
and
cheered
for
their
forward
the
score
was
now
a
final
chance
was
given
to
miss
allen
s
girls
to
score
when
one
of
the
opposing
team
made
a
foul
and
marjorie
was
chosen
to
make
a
free
shot
but
either
she
had
been
keeping
too
late
hours
or
else
she
was
too
nervous
for
she
missed
it
the
whistle
blew
and
the
score
remained
the
girls
shook
hands
and
crowded
around
miss
phillips
she
congratulated
miss
martin
s
girls
but
said
nothing
to
her
own
team
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
that
she
was
disappointed
marjorie
and
lily
walked
together
towards
the
gymnasium
you
were
splendid
lily
said
marjorie
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
you
the
score
would
have
been
a
good
deal
worse
than
it
thanks
said
lily
but
that
doesn
t
make
me
feel
better
about
the
it
was
a
lot
my
fault
admitted
marjorie
i
certainly
played
you
re
not
so
much
interested
in
athletics
now
are
you
asked
lily
as
the
girls
entered
the
door
yes
i
am
but
i
simply
don
t
have
enough
time
to
do
anything
well
i
m
always
helping
to
get
some
party
ready
for
the
sorority
or
talking
with
the
girls
or
going
to
a
meeting
or
a
feed
i
wish
i
could
do
better
though
she
added
wistfully
i
still
love
miss
phillips
and
somehow
i
m
not
as
good
as
i
am
when
i
feel
her
influence
wouldn
t
you
love
to
be
like
her
when
you
re
a
woman
lily
yes
i
would
i
m
crazy
about
her
too
you
see
i
know
her
better
now
by
the
way
did
you
know
what
we
girls
do
every
friday
evening
while
you
have
sorority
meeting
we
go
up
to
miss
phillips
s
room
and
take
our
and
she
reads
to
that
must
be
lots
of
fun
said
marjorie
what
sort
of
books
does
she
read
she
has
just
finished
reading
us
old
chester
tales
by
margaret
deland
it
s
great
too
and
one
night
she
read
us
a
story
by
henry
and
i
was
so
interested
that
i
wrote
home
and
asked
mother
to
buy
me
the
book
she
usually
reads
a
poem
or
two
besides
that
she
thinks
we
would
marjorie
thought
of
the
profitless
way
in
which
the
evenings
of
sorority
meetings
were
spent
and
sighed
but
she
said
nothing
that
evening
the
freshmen
pledged
became
regular
members
and
were
awarded
the
little
sorority
pin
to
wear
home
thanksgiving
chapter
ix
marjorie
s
although
marjorie
and
ruth
did
not
visit
each
other
during
the
thanksgiving
holidays
they
met
at
the
station
on
the
day
of
their
return
to
school
and
rode
back
together
but
they
seemed
to
have
less
to
talk
about
than
when
they
first
made
the
trip
ruth
was
still
jealous
of
marjorie
because
she
had
made
the
sorority
and
she
made
no
attempt
to
conceal
the
fact
from
the
other
girl
the
consciousness
of
her
feelings
made
marjorie
uncomfortable
they
tried
to
keep
up
the
conversation
with
commonplace
remarks
but
both
girls
felt
relieved
when
the
journey
was
over
lily
was
waiting
on
the
station
platform
as
the
train
pulled
into
the
school
town
at
this
time
she
presented
a
very
different
appearance
from
that
of
the
day
when
she
first
arrived
at
school
instead
of
an
elaborately
frizzed
coiffure
her
hair
was
parted
simply
on
the
side
and
hung
in
a
long
plait
down
her
back
and
her
clothes
were
more
appropriate
too
she
was
dressed
neatly
in
a
dark
blue
peter
thomson
over
which
she
wore
a
big
blue
sweater
and
on
her
head
was
a
knitted
cap
to
match
in
this
costume
lily
andrews
was
far
from
unattractive
marjorie
and
lily
kissed
each
other
affectionately
i
m
awfully
glad
you
re
back
marj
lily
said
yes
i
m
glad
to
be
back
too
i
surely
missed
all
the
it
was
better
for
you
than
for
me
said
lily
for
you
had
ruth
and
nobody
from
miss
allen
s
lives
near
i
don
t
count
exclaimed
ruth
sarcastically
lily
looked
puzzled
and
marjorie
hastily
changed
the
subject
i
m
glad
now
that
i
don
t
room
with
ruth
thought
marjorie
as
the
girls
separated
to
go
to
their
rooms
the
that
night
rang
with
laughter
and
gay
chatter
the
girls
had
all
had
a
good
time
but
they
were
glad
to
be
back
among
their
school
friends
again
there
was
so
much
to
tell
about
the
vacation
that
everybody
lingered
longer
at
the
table
than
was
the
usual
custom
marjorie
was
the
first
at
her
table
to
ask
to
be
excused
she
was
anxious
to
see
miss
phillips
she
had
to
tell
her
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
her
to
go
out
for
swimming
she
knew
the
teacher
would
be
disappointed
but
she
had
made
up
her
mind
she
met
miss
phillips
in
the
hall
and
after
greeting
her
somewhat
coolly
asked
her
to
come
into
the
parlor
with
her
i
am
afraid
i
can
t
go
out
for
the
swimming
team
miss
phillips
she
said
abruptly
after
they
had
seated
themselves
side
by
side
on
the
sofa
i
m
down
in
latin
and
if
i
don
t
study
hard
i
won
t
i
m
awfully
sorry
can
t
you
possibly
manage
it
we
need
girls
so
much
and
you
re
a
good
swimmer
already
i
wouldn
t
want
you
to
neglect
your
lessons
but
latin
won
t
take
all
your
time
will
it
no
but
you
know
the
sorority
takes
an
awful
lot
of
it
i
ve
just
got
to
give
up
something
so
i
guess
it
will
have
to
be
very
well
replied
miss
phillips
rising
you
know
but
as
the
days
passed
marjorie
often
wondered
whether
she
really
did
know
best
she
realized
in
a
vague
sort
of
way
that
she
was
not
so
happy
as
she
had
been
when
she
first
came
to
miss
allen
s
and
she
was
not
so
healthy
either
her
cheeks
had
lost
their
rosy
color
and
she
was
visibly
thinner
she
seldom
saw
miss
phillips
now
and
she
missed
her
when
it
came
time
to
pick
the
class
swimming
teams
it
was
a
difficult
matter
to
find
enough
freshmen
to
make
the
required
number
in
fact
most
of
the
girls
chosen
were
beginners
lily
andrews
who
had
gone
religiously
to
practice
every
day
made
it
and
strange
to
say
ruth
henry
developed
a
new
interest
in
athletics
and
proved
to
be
so
clever
in
the
water
that
she
was
immediately
chosen
captain
but
the
team
could
not
in
any
way
compete
with
those
of
the
upper
classes
in
the
tournament
it
was
the
first
to
be
defeated
marjorie
tried
not
to
take
the
defeat
to
heart
but
she
had
to
tell
herself
over
and
over
that
it
was
not
her
fault
that
it
would
hardly
have
done
better
if
she
had
taken
part
she
tried
to
dismiss
athletics
and
miss
phillips
from
her
mind
and
turn
her
attention
to
other
interests
she
planned
a
sorority
for
the
christmas
holidays
and
wrote
home
for
her
mother
s
consent
when
she
received
her
reply
approving
the
idea
she
ran
over
to
doris
s
room
to
announce
the
good
news
doris
was
enthusiastic
over
the
plan
marjorie
went
into
detail
in
her
explanation
you
are
invited
for
the
friday
before
we
come
back
to
school
she
said
and
stay
till
sunday
night
when
we
ll
all
come
back
together
i
m
just
asking
the
freshmen
and
sophomore
members
there
wouldn
t
be
room
for
i
love
exclaimed
doris
and
this
will
be
wonderful
i
hope
you
will
have
a
good
time
we
re
going
to
have
an
informal
little
dance
on
saturday
night
my
brother
jack
you
know
he
goes
to
episcopal
academy
will
invite
the
together
they
ran
over
to
ethel
todd
s
room
and
found
her
alone
marjorie
was
talking
excitedly
about
the
party
when
ruth
suddenly
opened
the
door
and
came
in
stopping
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
she
rose
and
added
we
must
go
ethel
i
just
wanted
to
make
sure
you
d
you
bet
i
ll
come
marj
answered
ethel
the
four
o
clock
train
yes
jack
my
brother
will
meet
it
with
the
marjorie
and
doris
went
out
and
ethel
turned
to
ruth
with
a
word
of
explanation
marjorie
is
inviting
the
freshmen
and
sophomore
members
of
our
sorority
to
her
home
for
the
last
week
end
before
we
come
back
won
t
that
be
delightful
charming
assented
ruth
unenthusiastically
ethel
turned
away
why
did
ruth
always
show
so
plainly
that
she
was
jealous
when
the
time
came
for
the
girls
to
leave
for
the
christmas
holidays
marjorie
succeeded
in
being
excused
in
time
to
make
an
early
train
she
wanted
to
avoid
the
necessity
of
the
long
ride
with
ruth
it
would
be
too
embarrassing
to
talk
about
the
and
yet
she
knew
ruth
would
bring
the
subject
up
if
she
had
the
opportunity
for
the
same
reason
she
managed
to
keep
away
from
ruth
during
the
holidays
once
or
twice
the
girls
met
at
entertainments
or
social
gatherings
but
they
never
were
alone
together
the
day
for
the
arrival
of
marjorie
s
guests
came
and
her
brother
jack
and
his
chum
roger
harris
each
borrowed
his
father
s
machine
and
drove
down
to
meet
the
four
o
clock
train
marjorie
went
with
jack
isn
t
ruth
coming
over
to
meet
the
girls
he
asked
as
they
got
into
the
car
no
answered
marjorie
without
looking
up
why
not
i
always
thought
she
was
your
best
she
s
of
my
best
friends
but
you
see
she
doesn
t
belong
to
our
sorority
so
she
s
not
but
there
s
nothing
secret
about
this
is
there
no
but
oh
you
wouldn
t
understand
jack
it
simply
wouldn
t
do
well
she
s
coming
to
the
dance
isn
t
she
marjorie
frowned
no
she
said
emphatically
she
isn
t
coming
any
of
the
jack
looked
disappointed
but
said
nothing
more
ruth
had
always
been
a
favorite
of
his
and
he
could
not
quite
imagine
a
party
without
her
in
a
minute
or
two
both
machines
pulled
up
to
the
station
and
the
young
people
got
out
just
as
the
whistle
of
the
locomotive
was
heard
around
the
curve
beyond
almost
before
the
train
stopped
mae
and
doris
had
reached
the
platform
and
ethel
marian
and
frances
were
close
behind
them
marjorie
had
not
expected
anna
who
had
gone
far
away
for
her
vacation
but
she
was
surprised
to
miss
lulu
davids
after
the
girls
had
kissed
each
other
and
the
boys
had
been
introduced
marian
hastened
to
explain
the
other
girl
s
absence
lulu
took
a
bad
cold
yesterday
she
said
and
her
mother
wouldn
t
let
her
come
i
guess
you
ll
get
a
letter
from
her
marjorie
expressed
her
disappointment
and
the
girls
began
to
get
into
the
machines
jack
and
roger
both
clamored
for
doris
s
suitcase
then
remembering
their
manners
they
went
to
the
assistance
of
the
other
girls
while
the
girls
were
unpacking
their
suitcases
marjorie
outlined
the
program
after
you
rest
and
dress
we
re
going
to
have
dinner
quietly
at
home
just
mother
and
dad
and
jack
and
roger
besides
us
then
the
boys
are
going
to
take
us
to
the
early
show
at
the
movies
so
we
ll
get
back
by
and
get
into
our
nighties
and
have
a
little
something
to
eat
in
our
rooms
and
settle
down
early
mother
s
going
to
let
us
sleep
as
long
as
we
want
and
then
jack
and
roger
will
drive
us
over
to
the
cutest
little
out
in
the
country
for
lunch
we
ll
come
back
early
to
rest
and
dress
for
the
i
m
so
excited
about
the
dance
said
mae
her
eyes
sparkling
the
only
thing
about
the
dance
is
we
expected
lulu
and
jack
has
invited
five
other
boys
besides
himself
and
that
s
much
nicer
than
having
too
many
girls
said
mae
but
it
s
not
so
nice
as
an
even
oh
well
we
ll
do
our
best
to
be
entertaining
said
doris
i
guess
you
can
easily
manage
two
doris
teased
marjorie
taking
great
delight
in
watching
the
pretty
girl
blush
wilkinson
soon
made
the
girls
feel
at
home
and
the
party
progressed
splendidly
jack
and
roger
with
their
constant
teasing
never
allowed
things
to
get
slow
they
collected
half
a
dozen
clocks
and
set
the
alarms
to
ring
every
half
hour
and
hid
them
in
the
girls
rooms
before
they
arrived
so
that
early
saturday
morning
the
sleepy
girls
awakened
at
regular
intervals
much
to
their
annoyance
by
half
past
seven
they
were
thoroughly
awake
and
decided
to
get
up
when
they
were
all
seated
at
the
breakfast
table
wilkinson
asked
casually
ruth
will
be
over
for
the
dance
i
suppose
marjorie
flushed
and
without
raising
her
eyes
from
her
plate
she
replied
no
she
isn
t
why
not
asked
her
mother
in
surprise
i
didn
t
invite
but
wilkinson
failed
to
notice
the
embarrassment
of
her
daughter
and
the
other
girls
and
persisted
with
her
questions
couldn
t
jack
get
enough
boys
together
yes
it
wasn
t
at
this
point
jack
interrupted
i
ve
even
got
an
extra
one
i
invited
one
for
the
girl
who
didn
t
then
call
ruth
on
the
telephone
suggested
wilkinson
marjorie
felt
herself
growing
angry
but
mother
she
explained
she
isn
t
in
our
nonsense
what
difference
does
that
make
but
marjorie
did
not
answer
and
her
father
seeing
her
predicament
came
to
the
rescue
and
changed
the
subject
after
the
girls
had
eaten
as
many
and
as
much
country
sausage
as
they
possibly
could
they
went
into
the
to
read
magazines
and
chat
while
roger
and
jack
went
out
to
the
garage
to
look
over
their
cars
when
they
returned
the
girls
were
waiting
for
them
couldn
t
we
all
go
in
one
car
asked
frances
it
seems
a
shame
to
be
separated
and
there
are
only
eight
of
us
but
roger
expressed
instant
disapproval
he
was
counting
on
having
doris
beside
him
on
the
front
seat
and
he
did
not
care
to
sacrifice
his
plan
well
maybe
it
will
be
better
to
take
both
cars
remarked
marjorie
we
re
not
big
but
our
coats
are
miss
sands
will
you
ride
with
me
asked
roger
boldly
thank
you
said
doris
and
she
stepped
into
his
car
the
young
couple
were
surprised
to
see
all
the
others
climb
into
jack
s
machine
laughing
in
high
good
humor
at
the
joke
they
had
played
in
leaving
them
alone
together
a
joke
however
which
suited
roger
immensely
and
which
was
not
unpleasing
to
doris
the
machines
started
together
jack
who
was
more
familiar
with
the
roads
took
the
lead
they
drove
along
the
principal
business
streets
of
the
town
and
stopped
at
one
or
two
of
the
principal
shops
finally
they
left
the
houses
and
stores
behind
and
following
an
unfrequented
road
made
for
the
open
country
they
rode
for
over
an
hour
laughing
and
chatting
gayly
jack
was
in
his
element
i
really
think
your
brother
likes
being
the
only
boy
among
us
all
teased
ethel
how
about
roger
asked
jack
oh
he
doesn
t
count
he
s
in
the
other
machine
and
besides
he
s
completely
absorbed
with
well
i
won
t
have
the
distinction
long
he
remarked
the
boys
will
be
here
do
tell
us
about
them
pleaded
mae
what
are
their
names
and
what
are
they
like
the
finest
fellow
to
my
way
of
thinking
is
john
hadley
he
s
a
senior
the
oldest
of
the
bunch
he
s
captain
of
the
football
team
and
senior
patrol
leader
of
the
boy
scouts
which
is
one
of
the
highest
honors
a
boy
can
get
at
are
you
a
boy
scout
jack
asked
ethel
no
not
yet
but
i
m
studying
for
it
and
hope
to
make
it
before
the
year
s
returning
to
the
subject
of
interest
he
continued
two
other
boy
scouts
both
juniors
are
coming
russell
henderson
and
david
conner
i
think
you
ll
like
them
too
and
the
other
two
boys
ross
morgan
and
art
whiteside
are
members
of
my
class
ross
is
funny
can
keep
you
laughing
forever
perhaps
he
isn
t
much
for
looks
but
everybody
likes
aren
t
there
any
freshmen
coming
asked
mae
a
trifle
disappointed
no
i
didn
t
ask
any
they
re
so
green
you
the
girls
laughed
at
the
typical
sophomore
point
of
view
are
the
boys
pretty
good
dancers
asked
marjorie
yes
i
think
so
all
but
ross
he
d
probably
rather
run
the
victrola
and
sit
out
dances
it
would
be
all
right
if
we
only
had
enough
girls
oh
here
s
the
cried
marjorie
glad
of
the
opportunity
to
change
the
subject
i
hope
roger
and
doris
aren
t
the
other
machine
drove
up
in
a
minute
and
the
young
people
jumped
out
marjorie
led
the
way
are
you
ready
for
us
king
she
asked
as
a
looking
landlady
smilingly
approached
the
girls
yes
indeed
there
s
your
table
by
the
window
miss
the
little
with
its
prettily
curtained
windows
its
fireplace
and
its
shining
white
paint
was
exceedingly
attractive
the
table
to
which
king
had
directed
the
girls
was
already
set
with
dainty
china
and
a
big
bowl
of
pink
roses
served
as
a
wilkinson
had
known
king
for
many
years
and
believing
that
the
young
people
would
enjoy
a
luncheon
by
themselves
she
had
telephoned
to
her
to
ask
her
to
act
as
chaperone
the
luncheon
from
the
appetizing
chicken
soup
to
the
french
pastry
dessert
was
delicious
and
dainty
the
service
was
good
and
the
party
was
in
high
spirits
after
it
was
over
king
invited
the
young
people
to
sing
some
school
songs
around
the
open
fireplace
it
was
almost
three
o
clock
when
marjorie
rose
to
go
if
this
were
the
end
of
it
all
said
ethel
as
she
climbed
into
the
machine
i
would
vote
it
the
best
time
i
ever
had
in
my
and
the
best
is
yet
to
come
said
frances
her
eyes
sparkling
with
anticipation
chapter
x
the
dance
as
soon
as
the
girls
reached
home
they
went
to
their
rooms
and
substituted
kimonas
for
their
street
clothes
preparing
to
rest
before
dinner
but
though
one
or
two
of
the
number
expressed
the
desire
for
a
nap
the
others
would
not
keep
quiet
long
enough
for
them
to
fall
asleep
ethel
was
attempting
to
comb
her
hair
at
marjorie
s
dressing
table
and
frances
was
manicuring
her
nails
all
the
other
girls
were
stretched
lazily
on
the
beds
of
one
or
the
other
of
the
communicating
rooms
isn
t
it
the
grandest
thing
in
the
world
to
belong
to
φαβ
and
go
on
parties
like
this
observed
frances
it
is
fun
to
be
together
said
marjorie
slowly
but
we
could
do
that
just
the
same
if
we
didn
t
belong
to
the
sorority
oh
but
we
wouldn
t
be
likely
to
the
other
girls
at
school
don
t
have
them
much
i
guess
it
would
be
too
hard
to
know
where
to
draw
the
line
without
hurting
some
girl
s
feelings
and
don
t
you
suppose
ever
hurt
anybody
s
feelings
by
being
exclusive
asked
marjorie
bitterly
i
don
t
believe
girls
like
lily
feel
hurt
they
know
they
re
out
of
i
wasn
t
thinking
of
lily
said
marjorie
as
she
left
the
room
i
wonder
if
marjorie
s
worrying
about
ruth
remarked
doris
thinking
of
the
conversation
at
the
breakfast
table
in
a
way
it
does
seem
too
well
she
s
foolish
if
she
worries
over
her
exclaimed
ethel
for
ruth
never
troubles
herself
about
marjorie
she
s
awfully
selfish
and
yet
i
wonder
whether
wouldn
t
feel
resentful
if
we
were
in
her
position
said
frances
it
s
terribly
hard
for
the
girls
who
make
the
marjorie
came
back
with
the
dress
she
was
to
wear
that
evening
and
the
girls
hastily
changed
the
subject
how
lovely
exclaimed
doris
looking
admiringly
at
the
georgette
marjorie
was
holding
on
a
hanger
marj
why
did
you
insist
that
we
all
wear
dance
dresses
asked
mae
her
hostess
laughed
gaily
it
s
a
secret
she
said
you
ll
find
out
but
i
want
to
know
now
let
s
all
get
out
our
dresses
and
see
if
we
really
did
strike
different
colors
suggested
marian
i
hope
they
harmonize
said
frances
the
soft
pastel
shades
of
the
six
dresses
did
blend
beautifully
together
lavender
green
yellow
pink
blue
and
white
had
been
selected
they
were
not
elaborately
made
perhaps
doris
s
was
the
fanciest
but
it
was
white
and
could
afford
therefore
to
have
more
trimming
it
reminds
me
of
a
rainbow
wedding
said
marian
did
you
ever
see
one
where
each
bridesmaid
wears
a
dress
and
the
bride
wears
white
laughed
marjorie
with
a
significant
look
at
doris
a
knock
at
the
door
drew
the
attention
away
from
doris
but
only
for
a
moment
for
the
box
which
maggie
wilkinson
s
second
maid
handed
to
marjorie
was
directed
to
her
flowers
for
the
bride
announced
marjorie
solemnly
doris
opened
the
box
and
found
a
bunch
of
violets
who
could
have
sent
them
teased
ethel
doris
glanced
at
the
card
and
hastily
slipped
it
into
her
suitcase
as
soon
as
she
was
dressed
she
pinned
the
flowers
through
her
sash
and
followed
the
others
to
the
but
to
her
great
relief
roger
was
not
present
at
supper
he
had
gone
home
to
dress
shortly
after
eight
o
clock
the
boys
all
arrived
together
jack
received
them
and
presented
them
to
the
girls
after
everyone
had
been
given
a
program
marjorie
announced
her
plan
for
the
first
dance
since
nobody
knows
anybody
else
she
said
i
made
a
little
game
for
finding
partners
for
the
first
dance
the
girls
as
you
see
all
have
on
dresses
now
there
is
a
candy
pillow
hidden
somewhere
in
this
room
to
match
each
dress
the
boys
hunt
for
them
and
then
go
to
claim
their
partners
of
course
she
continued
you
know
that
we
are
very
much
disappointed
because
one
girl
we
had
expected
didn
t
come
so
besides
the
six
candy
pillows
i
have
hidden
a
licorice
taffy
whoever
finds
the
taffy
has
to
be
content
to
eat
it
instead
of
dancing
the
first
dance
now
get
to
work
and
find
them
the
boys
searched
diligently
roger
came
across
a
green
pillow
but
seeing
that
no
one
was
looking
he
instantly
hid
it
again
in
order
to
look
further
for
a
white
one
then
he
saw
jack
with
the
white
pillow
and
gave
up
his
chances
of
securing
doris
he
returned
to
the
hiding
place
of
the
green
one
but
found
that
it
had
already
been
captured
and
david
conner
was
claiming
mae
for
the
dance
in
a
minute
or
two
he
found
the
licorice
taffy
and
hunted
wilkinson
to
spend
the
time
with
him
at
the
victrola
john
hadley
was
delighted
to
claim
marjorie
he
had
singled
her
out
as
the
most
interesting
girl
at
the
dance
and
she
certainly
did
look
attractive
in
her
simple
party
dress
i
feel
very
much
honored
said
john
to
have
the
first
dance
with
the
as
they
danced
he
asked
her
all
sorts
of
questions
about
the
school
and
the
girls
and
even
the
sorority
when
she
described
the
methods
of
the
latter
he
wrinkled
his
brows
doesn
t
that
cause
a
good
deal
of
unhappiness
he
asked
perhaps
at
first
but
i
guess
the
girls
who
aren
t
taken
in
soon
get
over
it
don
t
you
have
fraternities
at
episcopal
no
we
only
have
a
boy
scout
troop
and
all
the
money
and
pull
and
even
popularity
in
the
world
can
t
get
you
into
that
it
s
simply
a
question
of
hard
and
what
do
you
do
asked
the
girl
eagerly
john
started
to
tell
of
some
of
the
troop
s
activities
but
before
he
had
gone
very
far
the
dance
was
over
promise
me
the
intermission
and
the
last
waltz
he
asked
all
right
agreed
marjorie
if
you
ll
excuse
me
now
to
look
after
she
had
jack
announce
that
the
next
dance
would
be
a
paul
jones
and
that
after
that
the
boys
might
fill
their
programs
according
to
the
girls
wishes
he
also
said
that
during
the
intermission
when
refreshments
were
served
he
would
be
the
extra
man
without
a
partner
as
he
was
needed
to
help
so
the
fellows
could
go
ahead
and
get
their
programs
filled
when
everyone
was
served
marjorie
turned
to
john
and
asked
more
about
the
scouts
she
was
fascinated
by
the
accounts
of
their
activities
and
john
big
handsome
john
hadley
the
most
popular
fellow
at
episcopal
was
fascinated
by
this
slip
of
a
freshman
i
tell
you
he
suggested
why
don
t
you
start
girl
scouts
at
your
school
i
d
love
to
said
marjorie
but
i
don
t
have
time
now
for
the
regular
things
at
school
because
φαβ
keeps
me
so
busy
john
persuaded
marjorie
to
give
him
an
extra
dance
in
the
second
half
and
when
she
saw
how
happy
her
guests
seemed
to
be
she
agreed
wilkinson
had
set
the
time
limit
of
the
dancing
at
eleven
so
before
twelve
o
clock
the
boys
had
all
gone
and
the
girls
were
starting
up
for
bed
if
they
d
only
let
us
have
callers
at
miss
allen
s
sighed
doris
so
woefully
that
everybody
laughed
out
loud
they
do
when
you
re
a
senior
doris
said
ethel
so
cheer
up
you
ve
only
three
years
to
wait
and
surely
roger
s
love
won
t
grow
cold
in
that
time
doris
smiled
and
put
her
violets
in
water
well
it
s
been
the
loveliest
time
i
ve
ever
had
said
frances
oh
marjorie
i
m
so
happy
so
am
i
so
am
i
cried
the
others
i
guess
was
happy
marj
it
s
been
such
a
perfect
party
said
doris
but
one
person
was
unhappy
that
evening
one
girl
passed
the
gaily
lighted
house
and
looked
in
from
the
outside
one
girl
thought
of
the
sorority
she
had
missed
making
and
the
friend
she
had
lost
and
in
it
all
ruth
henry
blamed
not
herself
but
marjorie
chapter
xi
the
girl
scout
troop
ruth
had
no
desire
to
ride
back
to
school
on
the
same
train
with
the
sorority
girls
so
she
decided
to
wait
over
until
monday
morning
besides
she
had
an
important
letter
to
write
on
sunday
evening
and
she
needed
the
quiet
of
her
own
room
to
compose
her
thoughts
as
she
sat
at
the
window
she
saw
wilkinsons
machine
filled
with
the
joyful
members
of
the
pass
in
the
street
below
but
ruth
was
no
longer
envious
if
her
scheme
worked
as
she
felt
it
must
the
tables
would
be
turned
marjorie
and
her
friends
would
be
begging
favors
of
her
a
letter
and
a
package
in
her
box
on
wednesday
came
in
prompt
reply
to
her
letter
of
sunday
she
broke
the
seal
in
breathless
haste
its
contents
seemed
to
come
up
to
her
expectations
for
she
smiled
brightly
and
literally
ran
to
evelyn
s
room
i
ve
a
grand
new
plan
she
exclaimed
enthusiastically
after
she
had
opened
her
friend
s
door
without
knocking
a
rival
for
φαβ
no
cried
evelyn
dropping
the
book
she
was
reading
it
isn
t
possible
to
start
another
sorority
is
it
almost
as
good
answered
ruth
holding
out
her
letter
a
girl
scout
troop
my
cousin
tells
me
all
about
it
here
read
this
the
other
girl
took
the
letter
and
read
the
details
concerning
the
organization
of
a
troop
it
did
sound
very
interesting
the
letter
closed
by
stating
that
a
handbook
would
follow
ruth
was
already
untying
the
string
of
the
package
the
girls
sat
down
side
by
side
on
the
couch
and
turned
the
pages
together
do
you
suppose
anybody
can
belong
asked
evelyn
doubtfully
yes
it
seems
to
say
so
any
girl
over
ten
years
old
but
what
s
the
fun
then
if
lily
andrews
and
just
any
old
girl
can
belong
who
wants
to
be
a
girl
scout
don
t
you
know
lily
andrews
is
quite
popular
now
ruth
laughed
sarcastically
it
seemed
impossible
that
such
a
girl
could
really
stand
higher
among
her
than
she
did
herself
after
a
minute
or
two
she
said
i
guess
we
won
t
have
to
take
anybody
we
don
t
want
our
troop
ll
be
i
ll
bet
miss
allen
won
t
let
you
start
anything
secret
said
evelyn
ruth
stood
up
i
believe
i
ll
go
see
her
right
away
she
announced
and
talk
it
all
over
with
miss
allen
received
her
graciously
and
carefully
examined
the
book
i
would
have
to
look
more
closely
into
it
she
said
and
i
think
i
ll
consult
miss
phillips
i
have
always
heard
that
the
girl
scouts
is
an
organization
along
athletic
ruth
was
not
a
favorite
with
miss
phillips
she
frowned
oh
don
t
let
s
have
any
teachers
in
it
except
you
she
added
diplomatically
but
you
have
to
have
a
captain
a
woman
over
and
i
see
each
troop
has
members
but
there
are
girls
in
the
school
how
would
you
decide
who
was
to
belong
why
that
s
easy
i
started
it
so
evelyn
and
two
or
three
more
of
our
friends
would
vote
on
the
new
miss
allen
smiled
you
want
another
sorority
ruth
she
said
and
that
you
can
t
have
but
this
girl
scout
idea
appeals
to
me
i
ll
think
it
over
and
let
you
miss
allen
and
miss
phillips
spent
the
evening
in
going
over
the
handbook
they
were
delighted
with
its
contents
the
girl
scout
movement
seemed
to
be
just
the
thing
the
school
needed
it
is
my
idea
said
miss
phillips
to
start
the
troop
with
only
such
girls
as
have
or
over
in
their
lessons
and
are
at
the
same
time
members
or
substitutes
on
one
of
the
school
teams
this
will
give
the
organization
a
high
standard
at
the
outset
and
besides
i
think
it
will
make
both
lessons
and
athletics
more
popular
then
if
a
girl
drops
in
either
she
can
be
temporarily
deprived
of
the
troop
s
good
times
splendid
exclaimed
miss
allen
but
do
you
think
more
than
girls
in
the
school
will
qualify
if
they
do
we
can
start
two
troops
i
guess
you
can
easily
find
two
teachers
to
act
as
i
think
the
girls
ought
to
be
allowed
to
elect
their
own
captain
don
t
you
asked
miss
allen
and
miss
phillips
nodded
her
approval
they
will
have
to
meet
on
friday
evenings
of
course
she
continued
but
what
about
the
sorority
i
don
t
think
a
girl
should
be
allowed
to
belong
to
both
φαβ
and
the
girl
scouts
said
miss
phillips
emphatically
for
one
evening
in
a
week
is
all
that
can
be
spared
the
next
night
when
dessert
was
being
served
miss
allen
rose
from
her
seat
at
the
front
of
the
room
the
girls
instantly
became
quiet
and
turned
attentively
to
listen
to
what
she
had
to
say
girls
she
announced
in
her
usual
quiet
tone
we
have
decided
if
you
are
in
favor
to
start
a
girl
scout
troop
here
it
was
ruth
henry
s
idea
and
after
careful
consideration
of
the
matter
we
have
found
the
organization
to
be
splendid
the
members
will
wear
a
uniform
meet
once
a
week
and
on
saturdays
take
hikes
and
and
perhaps
this
summer
go
camping
there
will
be
lots
for
a
girl
scout
to
learn
cooking
horsemanship
in
fact
almost
anything
you
are
interested
she
paused
for
a
moment
and
the
girls
signified
their
approval
by
breaking
into
a
hearty
applause
ruth
looked
important
as
if
to
take
the
credit
of
it
all
to
herself
miss
allen
continued
we
have
decided
to
make
both
scholarship
and
athletic
ability
the
qualifications
for
membership
any
girl
who
wishes
to
belong
must
have
at
least
in
all
her
studies
and
must
be
a
member
or
a
substitute
on
some
school
team
and
if
there
are
more
than
girls
eligible
we
will
start
two
the
girls
were
surprised
at
miss
allen
s
remarks
and
many
of
their
faces
registered
disappointment
frances
wright
rose
from
her
seat
well
frances
asked
the
principal
miss
allen
when
will
the
girl
scouts
meet
friday
frances
looked
astonished
how
about
the
sorority
she
asked
no
girl
can
belong
to
both
the
girl
scouts
and
the
sorority
miss
allen
replied
significantly
it
would
take
too
much
of
her
time
she
must
choose
between
them
since
there
were
no
other
questions
miss
allen
took
her
seat
and
for
the
rest
of
the
meal
the
buzzed
with
the
excited
voices
of
the
girls
discussing
the
new
proposition
after
supper
ruth
made
her
way
to
marjorie
s
room
what
do
you
think
of
it
she
asked
marjorie
it
s
wonderful
the
other
girl
exclaimed
would
you
rather
belong
to
it
than
φαβ
i
almost
believe
i
would
it
sounds
so
much
more
worth
while
to
tell
you
the
truth
ruth
aside
from
the
excitement
of
being
asked
it
isn
t
much
of
an
honor
to
belong
to
φαβ
ruth
looked
triumphant
i
knew
i
d
make
you
girls
see
you
weren
t
so
much
i
never
said
we
were
well
you
acted
it
how
about
the
at
christmas
oh
ruth
i
am
sorry
about
it
yes
you
are
i
d
just
like
to
keep
you
out
of
the
girl
scouts
to
pay
you
back
it
was
then
that
the
door
opened
and
lily
andrews
came
in
with
a
book
in
her
hands
reading
as
she
entered
what
has
happened
to
you
lily
asked
ruth
turned
no
only
i
do
want
to
make
the
girl
scouts
and
i
m
almost
afraid
my
lessons
won
t
let
me
good
work
said
ruth
as
she
produced
her
handbook
and
began
to
read
the
tenderfoot
test
questions
aloud
the
next
night
was
sorority
meeting
and
the
members
went
prepared
for
a
fight
after
the
business
was
over
the
senior
president
opened
the
discussion
it
would
be
a
shame
she
said
for
φαβ
to
allow
a
passing
fancy
like
the
girl
scout
troop
to
shake
it
we
have
been
here
a
long
time
we
stand
for
the
oldest
traditions
of
the
school
we
must
think
carefully
of
all
the
alumnæ
before
we
make
any
several
other
girls
spoke
along
the
same
line
finally
marjorie
stood
up
girls
she
said
i
have
been
thinking
about
it
seriously
and
i
have
decided
i
would
rather
be
a
girl
scout
we
meet
here
friday
after
friday
and
do
nothing
but
have
a
silly
business
meeting
chat
and
drink
cocoa
and
when
we
ought
to
be
studying
or
practicing
for
some
team
we
are
going
to
a
feed
we
never
learn
anything
new
we
have
friends
but
we
are
not
supposed
to
make
any
close
ones
outside
our
own
set
and
once
a
year
we
make
the
whole
freshman
class
except
four
girls
miserably
unhappy
so
i
ve
decided
to
hand
in
my
resignation
to
the
everybody
was
quiet
for
a
moment
ethel
todd
was
the
first
to
speak
i
m
so
sorry
marjorie
she
said
tears
came
to
doris
s
eyes
it
won
t
be
the
same
without
you
marj
she
said
please
don
t
do
it
besides
said
mae
hadn
t
you
better
wait
till
you
re
asked
to
join
the
girl
scouts
marjorie
laughed
well
if
i
m
not
asked
it
will
be
because
i
m
down
in
my
lessons
and
i
ll
never
get
up
in
them
as
long
as
i
belong
to
φαβ
marjorie
s
right
said
frances
and
this
fall
when
i
saw
evelyn
and
ruth
almost
breaking
their
hearts
over
not
being
asked
i
just
felt
as
if
i
couldn
t
go
through
the
pledging
another
year
i
hand
in
my
resignation
after
some
hesitation
and
some
more
discussion
lulu
decided
to
follow
suit
and
two
of
the
juniors
joined
the
ranks
whatever
will
we
do
asked
mae
elect
new
members
we
re
not
allowed
to
replied
the
president
vacancies
can
only
be
filled
once
a
year
six
weeks
after
school
starts
we
ll
have
to
go
on
as
we
are
but
if
more
than
eight
girls
resign
the
sorority
must
be
abolished
we
have
to
keep
eight
girls
to
allow
it
to
exist
oh
girls
she
pleaded
don
t
follow
the
impulse
wait
think
of
the
alumnæ
think
if
you
ever
had
a
daughter
and
sent
her
here
she
would
stand
a
good
chance
of
and
she
might
be
left
out
like
poor
virginia
hall
whose
mother
was
an
φαβ
marian
guard
laughed
you
know
virginia
is
impossible
she
exclaimed
doris
had
been
thinking
hard
girls
she
said
i
don
t
want
to
be
mean
and
you
know
i
m
not
athletic
so
i
probably
won
t
make
the
troop
but
i
think
the
sorority
ought
to
be
abolished
and
now
is
the
best
time
to
do
it
so
i
too
oh
doris
you
re
president
of
the
freshman
class
exclaimed
one
of
the
seniors
yes
and
for
that
reason
more
than
any
other
i
want
to
do
away
with
φαβ
the
senior
president
intervened
girls
that
makes
six
resignations
but
let
s
don
t
take
them
as
final
we
ll
wait
till
next
week
and
give
everybody
the
chance
to
think
it
marjorie
made
one
request
may
miss
phillips
be
invited
to
come
in
next
week
after
the
business
part
is
over
the
president
frowned
but
several
of
the
girls
seemed
to
want
it
so
she
finally
consented
and
remember
girls
she
said
this
must
be
kept
secret
until
at
least
next
week
you
are
still
members
of
φαβ
promise
we
promise
murmured
frances
and
marjorie
and
two
or
three
others
and
the
girls
adjourned
chapter
xii
the
boy
scouts
demonstration
during
the
next
few
days
the
excitement
which
usually
preceded
was
felt
over
the
school
and
in
this
instance
it
was
even
more
intense
for
almost
every
girl
at
miss
allen
s
felt
that
she
had
a
chance
to
become
a
girl
scout
if
not
right
away
at
least
at
some
future
date
ruth
had
sent
for
more
handbooks
the
copies
went
the
rounds
and
were
read
and
the
uniform
proved
to
be
a
constant
topic
of
interest
and
more
than
one
girl
wrote
home
to
ask
for
the
money
to
buy
it
in
case
she
was
chosen
miss
landis
noticed
a
decided
improvement
in
the
girls
lessons
and
remarked
about
it
to
miss
allen
miss
phillips
too
appreciated
the
added
zeal
with
which
the
girls
attended
unrequired
practices
at
last
ruth
was
happy
she
had
started
something
worth
while
no
doubt
the
whole
student
body
as
well
as
the
teachers
would
look
to
her
constantly
as
a
benefactor
she
realized
too
that
she
had
dealt
the
most
decided
blow
to
the
sorority
that
it
had
ever
received
she
dreamed
of
its
annihilation
and
pictured
herself
always
as
the
leader
of
its
more
popular
successor
marjorie
too
was
happy
for
weeks
she
had
felt
a
sort
of
unrest
as
if
she
were
standing
still
while
the
rest
of
the
world
progressed
lily
s
accounts
of
the
friday
evenings
in
miss
phillips
s
room
had
deepened
this
feeling
but
now
that
she
had
made
her
decision
the
outlook
before
her
seemed
brighter
on
wednesday
evening
during
dinner
it
was
whispered
that
miss
allen
was
going
to
read
the
list
of
candidates
for
the
troop
very
soon
and
one
of
the
seniors
told
ruth
that
she
had
seen
her
carry
a
paper
into
the
the
girl
was
correct
in
her
supposition
for
as
soon
as
dessert
had
been
served
miss
allen
rose
from
her
chair
the
girls
stopped
eating
and
waited
in
breathless
attention
first
of
all
she
began
i
want
to
tell
you
that
on
friday
evening
the
senior
patrol
of
the
boy
scouts
from
episcopal
academy
are
coming
over
to
give
us
a
demonstration
of
scouting
we
will
hold
the
meeting
in
the
assembly
room
and
everybody
is
invited
but
only
the
candidates
whose
names
i
read
will
be
invited
over
to
the
gymnasium
afterwards
to
serve
refreshments
with
miss
she
paused
for
a
moment
and
the
girls
clapped
in
approval
i
am
sorry
the
list
of
candidates
is
so
small
she
continued
but
you
see
we
decided
on
such
strict
qualifications
there
were
only
seven
girls
eligible
but
this
was
partly
due
to
the
fact
that
the
school
swimming
team
hasn
t
been
made
up
yet
class
teams
don
t
count
and
we
had
only
the
hockey
members
to
select
from
and
of
course
many
of
those
girls
were
down
in
their
studies
but
miss
phillips
hopes
to
pick
the
swimming
team
soon
so
we
shall
have
more
girls
to
choose
miss
allen
put
on
her
glasses
and
reached
for
a
paper
on
the
table
without
further
explanation
she
read
out
the
names
senior
class
dorothy
maxwell
junior
class
evans
helen
stewart
sophomore
class
frances
wright
ethel
todd
marian
guard
freshman
class
lily
miss
allen
sat
down
for
a
minute
the
girls
could
only
gasp
then
the
room
buzzed
with
animated
voices
ruth
turned
to
the
senior
next
to
her
there
must
be
some
mistake
she
said
why
i
started
the
whole
thing
you
aren
t
on
the
school
hockey
team
are
you
asked
the
other
girl
no
that
s
so
admitted
ruth
i
guess
i
was
counting
on
the
class
swimming
team
but
believe
me
i
ll
make
the
school
swimming
team
you
just
see
unlike
ruth
marjorie
said
nothing
about
her
disappointment
but
she
was
surprised
that
her
name
was
not
on
the
list
for
being
a
hockey
team
member
she
had
expected
to
be
a
candidate
they
have
girl
scouts
and
i
am
not
one
she
said
over
and
over
to
herself
maybe
i
ought
to
have
stayed
in
φαβ
she
thought
it
isn
t
too
late
but
marjorie
was
not
a
girl
to
go
back
on
her
word
she
had
resigned
though
they
had
not
accepted
her
resignation
and
she
would
abide
by
her
decision
it
must
have
been
her
latin
that
kept
her
out
she
concluded
and
she
resolved
to
work
harder
in
that
branch
in
the
future
after
supper
ruth
came
over
to
marjorie
s
room
and
found
her
congratulating
lily
i
don
t
know
how
i
ever
did
it
said
lily
but
i
m
so
glad
if
only
miss
phillips
is
our
captain
do
you
think
she
will
be
you
are
allowed
to
elect
whoever
you
want
said
ruth
and
i
guess
it
will
be
miss
phillips
or
miss
landis
they
seem
to
be
about
the
most
popular
teachers
in
the
they
deserve
to
be
exclaimed
marjorie
especially
miss
phillips
i
think
she
s
wonderful
i
certainly
am
surprised
you
didn
t
make
it
marj
said
ruth
of
course
when
they
decided
on
that
team
business
i
knew
i
couldn
t
she
lied
i
thought
they
d
count
the
class
swimming
team
said
lily
why
we
can
t
really
start
till
we
have
eight
girls
for
you
need
at
least
that
number
for
a
miss
phillips
expects
to
pick
the
swimming
team
said
marjorie
how
do
you
know
asked
ruth
she
told
oh
i
m
going
in
swimming
before
breakfast
if
she
ll
let
me
marjorie
smiled
you
ll
make
the
team
ruth
she
said
but
how
are
your
lessons
all
right
i
guess
now
would
you
rather
belong
to
the
girl
scouts
or
φαβ
marjorie
i
am
resigning
from
φαβ
on
friday
but
you
weren
t
one
of
the
candidates
for
the
troop
i
know
but
i
want
to
help
abolish
the
oh
marj
you
re
a
peach
exclaimed
ruth
with
genuine
admiration
friday
evening
came
the
sorority
girls
had
their
meeting
immediately
after
supper
and
adjourned
in
time
to
see
the
boy
scouts
demonstration
the
same
six
girls
held
to
their
resolutions
to
resign
and
marian
guard
and
ethel
todd
joined
their
ranks
eight
girls
were
left
if
one
more
resigned
the
sorority
would
have
to
dissolve
according
to
her
promise
miss
phillips
came
to
the
meeting
but
she
was
late
and
found
that
there
was
really
nothing
for
her
to
do
marjorie
and
the
others
had
definitely
made
up
their
minds
so
they
contented
themselves
with
asking
the
teacher
a
few
questions
about
the
troop
and
adjourned
early
when
the
φαβ
girls
reached
the
assembly
room
they
found
it
already
crowded
at
two
minutes
of
eight
a
drum
and
a
bugle
sounded
in
march
time
and
a
flag
bearer
carrying
the
american
flag
and
followed
by
eight
boy
scouts
in
double
file
marched
up
the
aisle
to
the
platform
they
held
their
heads
high
and
their
shoulders
back
and
as
they
marched
they
looked
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
one
or
two
of
the
freshmen
giggled
but
the
boys
maintained
the
discipline
of
soldiers
marjorie
looked
for
john
hadley
and
saw
him
at
the
head
of
the
line
they
reached
the
platform
and
halted
at
the
command
of
their
patrol
leader
at
the
words
left
face
they
all
turned
to
the
front
the
flag
bearer
and
the
color
guards
on
each
side
stepped
forward
then
the
scouts
pledged
allegiance
to
the
flag
after
which
the
flag
bearer
and
the
guards
returned
to
their
places
in
the
line
at
the
signal
from
john
they
all
repeated
the
scout
oath
and
recited
the
twelve
boy
scout
laws
then
all
the
other
boys
sat
down
and
john
stepped
forward
the
girls
rather
expected
him
to
be
nervous
but
he
seemed
to
have
complete
control
of
himself
he
looked
straight
into
their
eager
faces
and
told
them
what
the
scouts
were
about
to
do
we
are
honored
to
be
asked
here
by
miss
allen
and
we
are
glad
to
welcome
our
sister
scouts
in
this
school
he
said
we
look
forward
to
lots
of
good
times
with
you
we
want
you
to
enjoy
our
cabin
in
the
woods
and
we
will
be
glad
to
teach
you
anything
we
know
we
even
hope
to
have
a
baseball
game
with
the
troop
and
we
promise
to
wear
skirts
if
you
will
lend
them
to
us
he
was
rewarded
with
a
laugh
at
his
suggestion
now
he
continued
we
are
here
to
show
you
some
of
the
ordinary
things
scouts
do
you
saw
our
opening
meeting
and
heard
our
promise
and
our
laws
you
know
our
salute
now
we
will
show
you
some
two
of
the
boys
stepped
forward
one
went
down
the
steps
will
someone
in
the
room
please
write
russell
henderson
the
scout
on
the
platform
a
message
then
he
will
signal
it
and
the
scout
at
the
end
of
the
room
will
receive
miss
phillips
wrote
something
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
handed
it
to
john
he
gave
it
to
russell
who
signaled
it
in
semaphore
with
two
flags
which
fairly
seemed
to
fly
from
one
position
to
the
next
and
in
a
minute
the
scout
at
the
end
of
the
room
read
out
we
thank
the
boy
scouts
of
episcopal
for
their
miss
phillips
said
that
the
message
was
correct
everyone
clapped
john
then
asked
for
another
message
and
frances
wright
handed
him
one
with
the
scout
still
at
the
end
of
the
room
russell
took
out
a
tiny
telegraph
instrument
and
tapped
out
sounds
which
were
meaningless
to
the
girls
but
which
were
evidently
intelligible
to
david
conner
the
scout
at
the
rear
for
he
read
out
girl
scouts
want
to
learn
that
is
right
said
frances
now
we
will
show
you
some
all
the
boys
except
john
took
part
in
this
four
acting
as
doctors
and
four
serving
as
patients
they
put
on
the
the
the
bandage
and
the
triangular
after
they
had
finished
these
they
demonstrated
resuscitation
fireman
and
the
making
of
a
stretcher
the
girls
watched
breathlessly
and
clapped
heartily
when
it
was
over
then
two
scouts
stepped
forward
and
did
what
seemed
to
the
girls
a
truly
marvelous
thing
they
put
down
a
big
sheet
of
tin
and
made
a
fire
without
any
matches
they
did
this
by
using
the
method
of
the
indians
a
wooden
rotated
until
the
friction
produced
heat
sufficient
to
ignite
the
fuel
when
finally
it
burst
into
flames
there
was
a
great
shout
of
applause
john
ended
by
thanking
the
girls
for
their
attention
saying
that
he
hoped
all
the
girls
present
would
eventually
become
scouts
miss
allen
thanked
the
boys
and
invited
them
to
the
gymnasium
to
meet
the
girls
who
were
candidates
the
rest
of
the
school
were
dismissed
to
return
to
their
rooms
it
was
a
much
envied
little
group
that
followed
miss
allen
out
of
the
room
and
more
than
one
girl
resolved
to
perfect
her
studies
or
her
athletics
in
order
to
be
among
the
favored
few
in
the
future
ruth
sought
marjorie
and
the
girls
went
out
together
closer
in
spirit
than
they
had
been
for
several
months
due
probably
to
their
common
misfortune
at
being
left
out
of
the
happy
number
and
to
think
said
ruth
that
lily
andrews
is
inside
the
favored
circle
and
we
are
both
outside
chapter
xiii
after
the
meeting
as
soon
as
the
opening
ceremony
was
over
and
john
hadley
stepped
forward
to
speak
he
looked
eagerly
around
the
audience
for
marjorie
but
he
was
not
able
to
locate
her
immediately
in
fact
it
was
not
until
the
boys
had
begun
to
semaphore
that
he
recognized
her
earnest
face
neither
he
nor
marjorie
showed
by
their
faces
that
they
had
ever
seen
each
other
before
but
john
waited
impatiently
for
the
meeting
to
be
over
so
that
he
might
have
a
chance
to
talk
with
the
girl
who
had
occupied
so
much
of
his
thoughts
during
the
past
days
when
miss
allen
had
said
that
the
girl
scout
candidates
had
already
been
chosen
and
that
they
were
to
meet
the
boy
scouts
for
a
few
moments
after
the
demonstration
john
felt
sure
that
he
would
see
marjorie
for
certainly
she
would
be
among
those
selected
jack
had
often
told
him
of
his
sister
s
love
of
the
and
the
interest
she
had
expressed
in
scout
affairs
at
the
dance
assured
him
that
she
was
just
the
type
of
girl
to
become
a
girl
scout
so
when
miss
allen
introduced
the
seven
girls
on
the
way
to
the
gym
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
keen
disappointment
that
john
realized
that
marjorie
was
not
one
of
them
recognizing
the
φαβ
sophomores
that
he
had
met
at
the
dance
he
went
up
and
spoke
to
ethel
after
they
had
exchanged
the
usual
greetings
he
tried
to
ask
as
casually
as
possible
where
is
marjorie
wilkinson
isn
t
she
a
candidate
for
the
scout
troop
no
replied
ethel
unfortunately
she
isn
t
why
not
asked
john
in
surprise
i
thought
she
would
be
just
the
sort
of
girl
to
go
in
for
a
thing
like
this
she
is
she
s
very
athletic
she
made
the
school
hockey
team
which
is
a
big
honor
for
a
freshman
but
miss
allen
made
other
by
this
time
the
party
had
reached
the
gymnasium
and
their
conversation
was
interrupted
while
miss
phillips
invited
everybody
to
dance
before
john
had
a
chance
to
ask
ethel
for
the
dance
david
conner
had
claimed
her
and
he
was
forced
to
find
another
partner
but
they
did
not
dance
long
for
miss
phillips
had
some
questions
she
wished
to
ask
the
boy
scouts
during
the
brief
intermission
that
followed
john
again
sought
ethel
while
he
was
turning
over
in
his
mind
an
easy
way
to
bring
the
conversation
back
to
marjorie
lily
approached
with
and
cake
miss
andrews
is
marjorie
s
said
ethel
while
lily
was
serving
them
she
can
tell
you
all
about
then
turning
to
lily
she
explained
mr
hadley
was
wondering
why
marjorie
isn
t
a
candidate
for
the
troop
and
i
started
to
explain
but
won
t
you
sit
down
here
so
that
i
can
see
if
miss
phillips
needs
me
lily
took
ethel
s
place
and
explained
about
her
s
latin
after
the
young
people
had
finished
their
miss
phillips
asked
everybody
to
move
their
chairs
into
a
circle
so
that
the
conversation
might
become
general
she
asked
john
all
sorts
of
questions
about
the
conducting
of
meetings
and
troop
affairs
and
the
girls
listened
with
interest
to
his
replies
we
would
like
a
spirit
of
friendly
rivalry
between
the
troops
he
said
we
might
have
contests
in
such
things
as
signalling
and
not
very
soon
laughed
miss
phillips
i
am
afraid
it
will
be
a
good
while
before
we
can
compete
with
you
won
t
you
tell
us
about
camping
asked
frances
what
do
we
have
to
take
with
us
and
about
how
much
does
it
cost
john
hesitated
it
would
be
easier
to
show
you
miss
wright
when
you
come
out
to
our
cabin
for
a
visit
we
ll
fix
a
date
for
a
party
as
soon
as
your
troop
is
the
girls
exclaimed
enthusiastically
over
the
plan
and
asked
more
questions
about
the
cabin
do
you
have
qualifications
to
join
your
troop
like
we
do
inquired
lily
we
certainly
do
said
john
emphatically
but
they
re
a
little
different
from
yours
every
three
months
we
have
what
we
call
a
candidate
test
to
pass
this
a
fellow
has
to
make
flower
and
leaf
collections
and
know
how
to
identify
a
certain
number
of
birds
and
answer
all
sorts
of
questions
besides
then
if
he
passes
that
test
he
has
to
spend
a
night
alone
in
the
cabin
he
s
allowed
a
gun
and
as
there
really
aren
t
any
tramps
around
to
be
afraid
of
it
s
pretty
except
for
the
ghosts
interrupted
david
most
all
the
boys
report
that
they
saw
something
at
this
point
miss
phillips
invited
the
boys
to
inspect
the
swimming
pool
and
the
conversation
lost
its
general
tone
john
walked
with
lily
it
must
be
terribly
exciting
to
stay
all
night
alone
in
that
cabin
she
said
but
i
m
afraid
i
d
be
too
scared
to
try
oh
i
guess
most
girls
would
i
bet
ruth
henry
wouldn
t
though
she
d
try
most
anything
ruth
henry
repeated
john
that
name
sounds
most
likely
you
have
heard
marjorie
speak
of
her
she
s
a
friend
from
her
no
but
i
have
heard
jack
wilkinson
mention
her
but
she
can
t
be
a
very
intimate
friend
for
she
wasn
t
at
the
dance
neither
was
i
said
lily
and
i
count
myself
a
very
intimate
friend
of
marjorie
s
but
she
only
invited
the
φαβ
girls
to
that
house
party
oh
said
john
significantly
and
how
is
φαβ
dying
the
girl
scouts
put
it
out
of
i
should
think
they
would
what
does
marjorie
think
of
that
she
resigned
long
good
for
her
said
john
well
i
wish
she
was
a
girl
scout
it
s
my
last
year
at
episcopal
and
if
i
don
t
see
her
this
year
i
guess
i
never
will
will
you
give
her
my
regards
he
added
hesitatingly
surely
said
lily
and
what
are
you
planning
to
do
next
year
hadley
princeton
i
think
he
said
though
i
m
not
quite
by
the
time
the
scouts
had
completed
their
tour
of
inspection
it
was
ten
o
clock
and
they
said
to
the
girls
and
hurried
off
to
get
their
things
lily
ran
up
to
her
room
as
fast
as
she
could
to
tell
marjorie
the
news
did
he
really
ask
about
me
asked
her
trying
to
appear
disinterested
yes
and
he
seemed
so
disappointed
that
you
weren
t
in
the
troop
tell
me
all
about
it
said
marjorie
and
lily
complied
with
her
request
carrying
on
one
of
those
conversations
about
what
said
that
girls
all
love
to
hold
with
each
other
but
i
didn
t
tell
him
how
soon
you
would
be
a
girl
scout
she
concluded
if
i
only
am
sighed
marjorie
it
seems
to
me
i
never
wanted
anything
so
much
in
my
life
well
keep
on
studying
and
it
won
t
be
long
now
till
the
next
latin
test
and
that
will
surely
give
you
the
chance
you
have
been
waiting
for
chapter
xiv
pansy
troop
meets
now
that
the
girls
had
seen
the
boy
scouts
demonstration
they
were
more
anxious
than
ever
to
get
their
own
troop
started
but
they
did
not
have
long
to
wait
for
the
following
afternoon
miss
phillips
placed
a
typewritten
list
on
the
bulletin
board
in
the
main
hall
in
a
few
minutes
a
crowd
began
to
gather
ruth
was
the
first
to
appear
to
her
great
delight
she
saw
her
name
at
the
bottom
of
the
list
who
made
it
asked
marjorie
who
was
too
far
back
in
the
crowd
to
read
the
paper
ruth
read
it
out
loud
school
swimming
team
seniors
margaret
williams
martha
meyers
juniors
helen
stewart
edith
evans
violet
henderson
sophomores
ethel
todd
freshmen
ruth
henry
substitutes
rose
craig
frances
congratulations
ruth
said
marjorie
sincerely
now
you
ll
surely
be
a
girl
scout
i
hope
so
said
ruth
as
she
walked
down
the
hall
with
her
old
friend
my
last
marks
were
pretty
good
but
you
never
can
if
i
ever
pull
up
my
latin
i
m
going
in
harder
for
swimming
i
want
to
learn
fancy
diving
and
said
marjorie
that
would
be
nice
agreed
ruth
but
for
the
present
i
m
going
to
be
content
with
plain
dives
and
swimming
anyway
i
can
swim
well
enough
to
be
a
first
class
scout
if
i
pass
the
other
the
girls
separated
to
dress
for
dinner
it
hardly
seemed
possible
that
miss
allen
could
announce
the
new
scout
candidates
so
soon
and
yet
a
decided
air
of
expectancy
prevailed
during
dinner
that
evening
every
few
minutes
one
or
two
girls
would
allow
their
glance
to
wander
in
her
direction
and
they
were
finally
rewarded
by
seeing
her
rise
from
her
chair
you
have
all
seen
the
names
of
the
girls
on
the
swimming
team
she
said
you
know
too
that
out
of
that
list
of
eight
girls
four
are
already
candidates
for
the
scouts
all
this
goes
to
prove
she
continued
just
what
miss
phillips
and
i
have
always
thought
the
same
girls
go
out
for
athletics
over
and
over
again
and
the
rest
of
the
school
is
content
to
let
them
do
all
the
work
now
what
we
hope
the
girl
scout
organization
will
do
is
to
make
interest
more
general
of
the
remaining
four
girls
on
the
swimming
team
only
one
stands
high
enough
in
her
lessons
to
be
selected
as
a
candidate
that
girl
is
ruth
henry
as
soon
as
the
girls
had
stopped
clapping
miss
allen
went
on
with
the
announcements
the
eight
candidates
dorothy
maxwell
edith
evans
helen
stewart
frances
wright
ethel
todd
marian
guard
lily
andrews
and
ruth
henry
are
to
meet
in
my
office
afternoon
at
two
o
clock
to
organize
and
to
elect
their
after
dinner
was
over
marjorie
sought
ruth
she
was
not
jealous
of
her
friend
s
triumph
ruth
deserved
it
and
she
did
not
so
with
genuine
pleasure
she
said
i
m
awfully
glad
you
made
it
ruth
nobody
deserves
it
more
than
you
ruth
thanked
her
and
marjorie
continued
enthusiastically
i
think
you
have
done
a
big
thing
for
the
school
and
i
mean
to
belong
just
as
soon
as
possible
i
m
going
to
give
up
everything
else
till
i
pull
up
my
latin
mark
ruth
bit
her
lip
to
her
half
the
fun
of
belonging
to
the
girl
scouts
consisted
in
being
able
to
write
home
and
tell
her
parents
and
friends
that
she
had
succeeded
where
marjorie
had
failed
but
she
said
nothing
to
indicate
her
feelings
to
the
other
girl
promptly
at
two
o
clock
the
next
afternoon
which
was
saturday
the
scout
candidates
assembled
in
miss
allen
s
office
the
first
thing
we
will
do
said
miss
allen
is
to
vote
for
a
captain
then
if
possible
we
will
invite
the
person
you
elect
into
the
meeting
and
she
can
take
charge
for
i
won
t
have
time
she
asked
ruth
to
come
forward
and
give
out
the
paper
for
voting
every
scout
should
be
prepared
with
a
pencil
but
if
any
girl
needs
one
this
time
i
will
lend
her
one
write
the
name
of
the
person
you
want
on
the
paper
if
there
isn
t
a
majority
for
any
one
candidate
the
first
time
we
will
vote
over
again
between
the
two
or
three
but
there
was
no
cause
for
a
second
vote
miss
phillips
was
elected
by
an
overwhelming
majority
lily
was
sent
to
the
gymnasium
to
tell
her
of
the
result
of
the
election
and
returned
with
an
invitation
for
the
meeting
to
transfer
its
location
to
the
gymnasium
in
a
few
words
miss
phillips
thanked
the
girls
for
the
honor
they
had
given
her
and
promised
to
live
up
to
the
scout
laws
as
faithfully
as
she
could
now
she
continued
since
we
have
eight
girls
we
will
elect
a
patrol
leader
and
a
what
are
their
duties
miss
phillips
asked
lily
miss
phillips
smiled
scout
andrews
she
replied
after
this
when
you
wish
to
ask
a
question
rise
salute
me
and
say
captain
if
i
return
the
salute
then
you
ask
your
question
now
let
s
try
that
lily
did
as
she
was
requested
and
miss
phillips
explained
that
the
duties
of
these
officers
were
to
get
the
girls
out
to
the
meetings
lead
the
marching
conduct
opening
exercises
and
so
forth
frances
wright
was
elected
patrol
leader
and
lily
andrews
was
made
corporal
now
said
miss
phillips
open
your
handbooks
to
page
and
you
will
see
the
different
ceremonies
to
be
used
we
will
begin
with
a
simple
one
after
she
had
read
the
instructions
aloud
she
blew
a
series
of
short
whistles
and
the
girls
assembled
in
line
with
frances
at
the
top
and
lily
next
lily
was
sent
to
the
room
next
door
for
the
flag
and
at
the
command
of
the
captain
the
girls
pledged
allegiance
then
they
sang
one
stanza
of
the
banner
standing
at
attention
after
this
led
by
miss
phillips
they
took
the
scout
oath
with
their
right
hands
raised
to
their
foreheads
they
repeated
on
my
honor
i
will
try
to
be
true
to
god
and
my
country
to
help
others
at
all
times
to
obey
the
scout
their
hands
dropped
to
their
sides
patrol
leader
wright
commanded
miss
phillips
lead
in
the
scout
frances
stepped
in
front
of
the
group
saluted
the
captain
and
the
girls
repeated
with
her
a
girl
scout
s
honor
is
to
be
trusted
a
girl
scout
is
loyal
a
girl
scout
s
duty
is
to
be
useful
and
to
help
others
a
girl
scout
is
a
friend
to
all
and
a
sister
to
every
other
girl
scout
a
girl
scout
is
courteous
a
girl
scout
is
a
friend
to
animals
a
girl
scout
obeys
orders
a
girl
scout
is
cheerful
a
girl
scout
is
thrifty
a
girl
scout
is
clean
in
thought
word
and
what
is
your
motto
asked
miss
phillips
be
prepared
they
answered
what
is
your
slogan
do
a
good
turn
be
seated
commanded
miss
phillips
after
opening
ceremony
she
continued
when
the
girls
were
seated
comes
scout
talk
i
am
going
to
talk
about
your
good
turn
it
will
be
harder
for
you
girls
than
for
the
scouts
who
live
at
home
but
let
me
see
what
you
can
do
make
a
list
of
the
things
you
do
but
do
not
sign
it
bring
it
next
week
to
the
meeting
and
perhaps
we
shall
read
them
then
she
suggested
some
good
turns
that
might
be
done
at
the
school
business
meeting
is
next
in
order
we
must
first
of
all
have
a
secretary
i
am
ready
for
after
a
great
deal
of
consideration
ethel
todd
was
elected
secretary
ruth
henry
was
made
treasurer
now
it
is
time
to
decide
upon
a
name
announced
miss
phillips
a
name
asked
ruth
without
rising
or
saluting
can
we
have
greek
letters
or
something
like
that
the
other
girls
smiled
at
her
impetuosity
but
miss
phillips
hastened
to
correct
the
false
impression
no
not
that
she
answered
but
each
troop
takes
the
name
of
a
flower
rose
daisy
violet
and
so
on
and
each
patrol
takes
the
name
of
a
bird
suppose
some
of
you
suggest
the
names
you
would
like
and
we
can
vote
upon
the
three
most
frances
suggested
pansy
and
the
girls
decided
to
make
it
their
choice
the
selection
of
the
patrol
symbol
was
put
off
until
a
later
time
after
dues
had
been
discussed
and
agreed
upon
miss
phillips
said
i
would
like
to
suggest
that
we
consider
candidates
only
once
a
month
it
is
nearly
february
now
and
we
are
just
starting
it
would
make
too
much
confusion
if
we
take
them
in
at
every
meeting
so
i
think
the
best
plan
would
be
to
get
the
list
of
those
eligible
from
miss
allen
at
the
end
of
each
month
and
take
them
in
at
the
following
this
suggestion
was
voted
upon
and
passed
when
shall
we
have
our
first
hike
asked
the
captain
frances
wright
rose
and
saluted
miss
phillips
captain
she
said
let
s
wait
until
we
get
our
helen
stewart
s
face
fell
she
was
one
of
the
poorest
girls
in
the
school
her
mother
was
a
widow
and
it
was
about
all
she
could
afford
to
do
to
pay
the
regular
expenses
helen
did
not
know
how
she
would
ever
get
her
uniform
all
right
agreed
the
captain
but
you
all
know
you
have
to
the
uniform
you
aren
t
allowed
to
write
home
and
ask
your
parents
for
the
money
and
what
is
more
you
are
supposed
to
it
lily
looked
disappointed
she
was
thinking
of
having
her
uniform
made
by
a
fifth
avenue
tailor
helen
looked
proportionately
pleased
there
are
lots
of
things
you
can
do
to
earn
money
typewriting
in
the
office
taking
care
of
babies
running
errands
for
people
in
the
village
taking
orders
for
knitting
and
sewing
but
we
ll
be
almost
like
servants
exclaimed
lily
interrupting
her
captain
s
speech
it
won
t
hurt
you
girls
miss
phillips
said
laughingly
and
to
encourage
you
she
added
i
ll
earn
mine
aside
from
my
and
we
ll
make
it
a
kind
of
race
to
see
who
can
earn
theirs
first
let
s
have
a
bank
and
a
banker
and
report
each
week
on
what
we
have
the
girls
approved
of
the
plan
and
ethel
todd
the
secretary
was
chosen
banker
now
said
miss
phillips
we
will
adjourn
our
business
meeting
for
scout
work
open
your
handbooks
to
page
we
are
going
over
the
tenderfoot
test
the
test
seemed
comparatively
easy
and
miss
phillips
decided
to
give
it
the
following
week
you
may
each
bring
a
quarter
she
said
and
if
everybody
passes
we
will
fill
out
our
blank
and
send
it
to
national
headquarters
in
new
york
now
continued
the
captain
let
s
have
some
games
next
week
we
ll
have
military
drill
but
we
won
t
start
that
let
s
play
boots
without
does
anybody
know
it
the
girls
shook
their
heads
and
miss
phillips
requested
all
but
frances
to
go
into
her
office
she
explained
the
game
to
frances
and
told
her
to
go
and
bring
one
of
the
girls
into
the
room
she
returned
with
lily
you
want
to
belong
to
the
girl
scouts
don
t
you
lily
asked
miss
phillips
with
mock
solemnity
yes
then
will
you
promise
to
do
as
i
do
but
to
say
just
what
i
tell
you
to
say
i
miss
phillips
took
three
jumps
say
boots
without
shoes
lily
imitated
the
action
and
repeated
boots
without
shoes
but
that
isn
t
right
protested
miss
phillips
we
ll
try
over
she
gave
her
increasingly
difficult
gymnastic
feats
to
perform
ending
each
with
the
same
command
of
say
boots
without
shoes
finally
lily
saw
through
the
trick
and
cried
triumphantly
boots
miss
phillips
sent
her
for
the
next
girl
and
they
continued
until
all
the
girls
were
initiated
before
they
separated
for
the
evening
miss
phillips
taught
the
girls
the
scout
yell
girl
scouts
girl
scouts
and
they
yelled
it
joyfully
adding
first
miss
allen
s
miss
allen
s
on
the
end
and
then
giving
it
over
again
in
honor
of
miss
phillips
lily
ran
up
to
find
marjorie
who
had
spent
the
first
friday
evening
since
in
her
own
room
both
girls
were
glad
that
there
was
no
secrecy
about
the
girl
scout
meeting
which
would
prevent
them
from
discussing
it
together
ruth
went
over
to
her
own
room
with
equal
haste
joyfully
anticipating
the
letter
she
would
write
to
the
folks
at
home
to
tell
them
of
her
good
fortune
chapter
xv
the
latin
test
by
the
twentieth
of
february
the
eight
candidates
had
passed
their
tenderfoot
tests
and
were
registered
at
national
headquarters
as
regular
members
of
the
girl
scouts
after
the
preliminary
exercises
of
the
meeting
were
over
captain
phillips
asked
for
a
report
from
the
banker
all
the
girls
have
handed
in
enough
money
for
the
khaki
and
buttons
captain
ethel
todd
announced
after
she
had
given
the
usual
salute
and
some
have
turned
in
more
than
was
required
shall
i
give
that
to
the
treasurer
no
answered
miss
phillips
we
will
keep
up
our
banking
system
so
that
each
girl
can
always
have
money
on
hand
to
purchase
the
necessary
equipment
now
she
continued
turning
to
the
troop
i
want
reports
on
how
the
individual
girl
scouts
earned
their
the
accounts
that
followed
were
both
interesting
and
original
ruth
had
made
fudge
and
sold
it
at
a
profit
ethel
todd
had
addressed
envelopes
in
miss
allen
s
office
and
had
helped
with
the
school
records
frances
and
marian
had
taken
care
of
babies
for
some
alumnæ
members
of
φαβ
who
lived
in
the
village
lily
andrews
and
edith
evans
had
secured
subscriptions
for
a
woman
s
magazine
and
helen
stewart
and
dorothy
maxwell
had
advertised
their
services
for
odd
jobs
among
their
and
had
been
rewarded
with
plenty
of
mending
pressing
darning
and
even
all
the
girls
agreed
that
the
experience
had
been
fun
even
lily
admitted
that
she
did
not
mind
it
after
she
had
once
started
and
what
did
you
do
captain
phillips
she
asked
i
organized
a
for
the
little
tots
of
the
village
which
meets
one
afternoon
a
week
and
i
charge
each
child
ten
cents
a
lesson
she
replied
good
exclaimed
lily
you
lived
up
to
your
promise
girls
said
the
captain
i
am
going
into
the
city
and
i
will
order
the
uniforms
the
kind
that
come
cut
out
ready
to
sew
then
we
ought
to
receive
them
before
next
saturday
and
if
we
do
we
can
meet
up
in
the
and
give
up
the
day
to
making
and
when
will
we
go
on
our
hike
captain
asked
frances
with
the
usual
formality
the
following
saturday
i
hope
you
see
the
marks
come
out
the
next
monday
and
the
gym
team
will
be
selected
so
new
girls
will
be
eligible
to
the
troop
after
that
and
i
want
one
hike
by
ourselves
as
a
reward
for
the
good
work
you
have
how
many
new
girls
do
you
think
we
shall
have
asked
marian
there
will
be
ten
girls
on
the
school
but
probably
some
of
those
are
already
scouts
and
then
there
is
a
possibility
that
some
of
the
girls
who
are
either
hockey
or
members
may
pull
up
their
marks
in
their
studies
and
lily
clapped
her
hands
i
do
so
hope
marjorie
makes
it
she
exclaimed
with
such
enthusiasm
that
miss
phillips
did
not
have
the
heart
to
reprove
her
for
her
breach
of
discipline
and
she
will
she
added
if
she
makes
in
her
latin
ruth
looked
annoyed
half
the
fun
of
being
a
girl
scout
was
the
publicity
of
it
the
fact
that
she
was
one
of
the
eight
distinguished
members
that
she
belonged
to
something
marjorie
could
not
join
as
soon
as
we
get
more
girls
into
the
troop
announced
captain
phillips
we
will
give
a
play
to
earn
enough
money
to
pay
for
our
camping
trip
this
the
girls
were
so
interested
that
miss
phillips
was
forced
to
go
into
details
about
the
plans
they
talked
such
a
long
time
that
it
was
necessary
to
adjourn
without
the
customary
games
marjorie
s
evening
had
been
spent
in
her
own
room
studying
latin
although
the
test
was
not
to
be
held
until
the
following
tuesday
she
felt
that
she
had
not
a
minute
to
lose
the
hardest
part
to
her
was
of
course
the
english
into
latin
prose
composition
miss
white
the
teacher
called
it
it
was
in
this
that
she
had
failed
before
therefore
she
directed
all
her
effort
to
mastering
it
there
was
not
one
construction
of
which
she
felt
uncertain
she
did
not
see
how
she
could
fail
just
as
she
was
gathering
her
books
into
a
neat
pile
for
the
night
the
door
opened
and
lily
came
in
she
was
full
of
the
plans
for
the
hike
the
play
and
the
camp
and
she
poured
her
news
into
marjorie
s
eager
ears
when
she
stopped
a
moment
for
breath
the
other
girl
exclaimed
i
simply
make
it
i
d
love
to
be
in
the
play
and
go
camping
just
think
of
the
fun
of
course
miss
phillips
will
go
with
you
this
summer
certainly
replied
lily
oh
marj
you
ll
surely
be
a
girl
scout
before
then
but
keep
on
studying
she
urged
when
marjorie
laid
her
paper
on
miss
white
s
desk
on
tuesday
she
felt
that
she
had
done
exceedingly
well
in
the
examination
she
had
thought
out
each
construction
and
had
written
carefully
she
had
gone
over
her
paper
twice
to
make
sure
that
there
were
no
corrections
or
omissions
and
she
was
the
next
to
last
girl
to
leave
the
room
ruth
henry
was
the
last
girl
to
turn
in
her
paper
this
was
not
because
she
was
slow
or
uncertain
of
her
work
for
she
was
an
excellent
latin
student
but
she
usually
remained
to
walk
over
to
the
dormitory
with
miss
white
with
whom
she
was
a
great
favorite
just
as
she
rose
from
her
seat
to
hand
in
her
paper
a
messenger
entered
from
the
office
miss
white
here
is
a
telegram
for
you
she
said
handing
her
a
yellow
envelope
ruth
stood
still
and
the
messenger
withdrew
as
miss
white
read
the
telegram
her
face
grew
pale
what
is
it
miss
white
oh
i
hope
nothing
is
wrong
said
ruth
my
mother
s
very
ill
i
must
go
home
i
m
so
sorry
is
there
anything
i
can
do
asked
ruth
impulsively
miss
white
hesitated
a
moment
yes
dear
thank
you
straighten
up
this
room
and
my
desk
put
the
papers
in
a
neat
pile
in
the
bottom
drawer
then
lock
it
and
bring
me
the
key
and
you
can
carry
my
suitcase
to
the
station
if
you
yes
indeed
please
don
t
worry
miss
white
surely
she
ll
get
better
miss
white
smiled
sadly
and
handed
ruth
the
key
you
are
a
dear
good
girl
ruth
she
said
as
she
opened
the
door
ruth
began
to
straighten
the
papers
which
the
girls
had
piled
one
by
one
on
top
of
the
teacher
s
desk
as
she
picked
them
up
one
from
the
top
of
the
pile
fell
to
the
floor
she
stooped
to
pick
it
up
it
was
marjorie
wilkinson
s
suddenly
ruth
thought
of
the
other
girl
s
and
the
dance
which
she
had
witnessed
through
the
lighted
windows
she
remembered
marjorie
s
indifference
during
the
days
that
followed
her
pledging
to
the
sorority
and
heard
lily
exclaim
over
again
that
if
her
made
in
this
latin
test
she
would
be
a
girl
scout
this
was
the
opportunity
she
had
been
waiting
for
if
she
had
schemed
and
planned
for
it
it
could
not
have
been
more
perfect
if
she
let
this
chance
go
by
she
would
probably
never
have
another
like
it
she
would
pay
marjorie
back
for
what
she
had
done
in
the
past
taking
a
pen
and
dipping
it
in
miss
white
s
inkwell
she
turned
to
the
questions
marked
english
into
with
her
knowledge
it
was
a
simple
matter
to
make
little
changes
adding
letters
here
and
there
at
the
ends
of
words
to
make
the
gender
number
tense
or
case
of
the
word
out
of
harmony
with
the
rest
of
the
sentence
once
she
thought
she
heard
a
sound
at
the
door
she
quickly
dropped
her
pen
and
pretended
to
straighten
the
papers
but
no
one
came
in
and
she
finished
her
work
of
deceit
to
the
casual
observer
marjorie
s
paper
looked
no
different
but
to
the
latin
student
it
proved
to
be
like
the
poor
twisted
poem
of
father
william
in
alice
in
wonderland
wrong
from
beginning
to
while
she
was
locking
miss
white
s
desk
the
risk
of
her
act
occurred
to
her
what
if
the
teacher
should
decide
to
return
the
papers
to
the
girls
contrary
to
her
usual
custom
what
if
marjorie
should
not
be
satisfied
with
her
mark
and
should
ask
miss
white
to
go
over
the
paper
with
her
but
it
was
too
late
now
to
think
of
the
danger
the
deed
was
done
and
she
must
take
the
consequences
she
decided
on
the
whole
that
she
would
stand
less
chance
of
detection
if
the
teacher
took
the
papers
home
with
her
to
mark
accordingly
she
unlocked
the
desk
again
and
took
out
the
pile
and
leaving
everything
in
good
order
went
over
to
miss
white
s
room
i
brought
the
test
papers
over
to
you
miss
white
instead
of
leaving
them
in
your
desk
because
i
thought
you
would
want
to
take
them
home
and
mark
them
there
so
you
could
mail
the
averages
to
miss
allen
before
the
term
thank
you
ruth
you
are
so
thoughtful
here
i
will
put
them
in
my
suitcase
she
said
taking
them
from
the
girl
now
i
think
i
m
ready
she
concluded
here
is
a
sweater
for
you
to
wear
to
the
station
and
i
guess
your
hands
won
t
get
lost
in
these
ruth
put
on
the
borrowed
clothing
and
picked
up
the
suitcase
after
she
came
back
from
the
station
she
began
to
dress
for
dinner
but
said
nothing
to
ethel
of
the
incident
lest
in
some
way
it
might
throw
suspicion
on
her
all
the
rest
of
the
week
marjorie
felt
the
satisfaction
of
a
person
whose
task
was
well
done
she
looked
eagerly
forward
to
monday
when
her
success
would
be
announced
and
the
troop
would
claim
her
as
a
candidate
she
knew
her
tenderfoot
test
already
and
she
thought
constantly
of
possible
ways
to
earn
money
for
her
uniform
the
friday
evening
before
the
term
closed
φαβ
girls
met
for
the
last
time
two
juniors
who
had
been
chosen
for
the
gym
team
and
who
were
practically
sure
of
making
the
girl
scout
troop
resigned
and
with
only
six
members
left
the
sorority
had
to
disband
as
marjorie
sat
alone
in
her
room
that
evening
while
lily
attended
the
scout
meeting
she
occupied
herself
by
writing
a
long
letter
home
and
in
this
letter
she
told
her
mother
to
expect
a
splendid
report
from
the
school
with
a
mark
in
latin
that
she
would
be
proud
of
and
i
think
she
concluded
that
this
is
the
last
friday
evening
i
shall
have
to
spend
in
my
room
alone
for
by
this
time
next
week
i
hope
to
be
a
girl
scout
chapter
xvi
a
winter
hike
it
was
indeed
an
attractive
group
of
girls
who
met
on
saturday
morning
dressed
in
their
new
scout
uniforms
with
their
packs
strapped
to
their
backs
perhaps
they
felt
a
trifle
but
they
had
no
need
to
be
ashamed
of
their
appearance
for
their
suits
could
not
have
fitted
them
more
neatly
if
they
had
been
made
by
a
fashionable
dressmaker
as
soon
as
they
left
the
building
they
formed
in
a
line
two
abreast
and
swung
along
in
step
miss
phillips
told
them
that
when
they
left
the
village
and
struck
the
open
country
they
might
sing
as
they
marched
and
that
reminds
me
she
said
i
want
some
scout
songs
of
our
very
own
and
i
happened
to
mention
the
matter
to
miss
allen
and
she
offered
a
canteen
as
a
prize
for
the
best
song
submitted
before
june
first
so
get
to
work
girls
you
needn
t
attempt
to
write
the
music
unless
you
want
to
but
take
some
familiar
tune
and
make
up
new
the
day
was
clear
and
just
cold
enough
to
make
the
walk
bracing
the
girls
had
gone
to
bed
early
the
night
before
and
were
in
perfect
trim
for
the
hike
and
they
were
very
happy
they
would
be
glad
to
welcome
the
new
girls
the
following
week
and
make
them
their
scout
sisters
but
for
the
present
they
were
content
to
enjoy
this
last
intimate
little
adventure
alone
miss
phillips
had
secured
copies
of
the
nature
calendar
of
the
buffalo
society
of
natural
sciences
and
the
girls
had
made
a
list
of
some
of
the
february
birds
to
look
for
they
had
noted
the
characteristics
of
the
hemlock
the
spruce
and
the
red
and
white
cedars
and
were
anxious
to
put
their
knowledge
to
a
test
ruth
and
ethel
had
been
given
two
dollars
from
the
treasury
with
the
instructions
to
purchase
wholesome
food
we
shall
have
our
first
lesson
in
cooking
miss
phillips
had
said
so
be
sure
to
buy
something
that
we
can
cook
over
a
camp
fire
but
don
t
get
anything
like
raw
beans
she
had
laughingly
instructed
them
for
they
require
twelve
hours
baking
and
we
don
t
expect
to
make
it
an
overnight
hike
this
time
so
ruth
and
ethel
had
done
their
purchasing
and
had
wrapped
their
articles
into
eight
packages
they
gave
each
girl
a
bundle
to
carry
but
refused
to
tell
what
they
had
bought
and
of
course
everybody
tried
to
find
out
by
feeling
her
package
but
in
most
cases
this
failed
to
reveal
the
identity
of
the
contents
after
ten
minutes
walk
the
scouts
had
left
the
town
and
struck
the
woods
miss
phillips
blew
a
series
of
short
whistles
and
called
the
girls
together
for
instructions
we
are
going
to
lay
a
trail
she
said
frances
ethel
dorothy
and
ruth
are
to
go
ahead
and
put
down
the
signals
the
rest
of
us
will
wait
here
ten
minutes
and
then
follow
lay
your
trail
until
you
come
to
a
good
place
to
make
a
fire
and
eat
lunch
choose
a
spot
somewhere
near
good
water
and
be
sure
that
you
are
well
protected
from
the
wind
if
you
can
find
a
flat
rock
so
much
the
better
but
be
sure
that
the
ground
is
i
ve
never
eaten
around
a
camp
fire
said
lily
it
s
going
to
be
such
fun
how
will
we
know
what
signals
to
lay
asked
ruth
i
am
going
to
tell
you
some
of
the
simple
ones
perhaps
we
shall
learn
those
more
difficult
later
on
from
the
boy
scouts
has
anybody
a
i
have
captain
said
marian
producing
one
will
you
lend
it
to
ethel
now
ethel
you
can
blaze
a
trail
by
cutting
off
a
piece
of
bark
from
a
tree
along
a
path
which
you
are
following
but
that
is
not
to
be
the
only
signal
you
can
break
a
twig
and
leave
it
hanging
or
you
can
set
a
small
stone
on
top
of
a
larger
one
to
mark
the
trail
now
for
the
turns
if
you
want
us
to
follow
the
path
to
the
right
put
a
long
mark
on
the
right
of
the
tree
trunk
beneath
the
blaze
or
bend
your
twig
out
straight
to
the
right
or
when
you
put
your
little
stone
on
top
of
your
big
one
place
another
small
stone
beside
them
to
the
right
and
of
course
vice
versa
for
the
left
do
you
understand
yes
yes
cried
the
girls
one
thing
more
has
everybody
matches
in
her
knapsack
fortunately
everybody
did
have
for
miss
phillips
had
especially
warned
the
girls
to
be
provided
with
them
now
she
continued
i
want
you
to
try
to
keep
together
and
always
remember
this
no
fewer
than
two
girls
must
travel
together
in
the
woods
but
if
anything
ever
should
happen
to
separate
one
of
you
from
your
companions
and
you
find
that
you
are
lost
select
a
high
open
spot
and
make
two
fires
carefully
piling
on
lots
of
leaves
and
grass
to
make
smoke
for
girl
scouts
have
adopted
the
signal
that
two
smokes
arising
together
mean
i
am
lost
now
run
along
girls
before
you
get
cold
while
the
remaining
girls
edith
marian
lily
and
helen
waited
the
ten
minutes
miss
phillips
instituted
a
game
to
keep
them
from
becoming
cold
when
the
time
was
up
they
started
off
looking
carefully
for
signals
of
the
trail
miss
phillips
told
them
to
call
out
when
they
discovered
a
trail
and
instructed
each
girl
to
keep
count
of
the
signs
she
discovered
first
once
or
twice
everybody
missed
a
mark
and
went
straight
ahead
then
failing
to
see
any
evidences
of
the
trail
they
all
turned
back
and
discovered
they
had
missed
the
turn
finally
dorothy
spied
a
smoke
in
the
distance
can
that
be
our
girls
she
asked
i
guess
so
replied
miss
phillips
one
smoke
means
we
are
camping
the
girls
ran
as
fast
as
they
could
and
soon
reached
the
spot
ethel
had
spread
the
big
blanket
on
the
ground
and
the
other
girls
had
succeeded
in
starting
a
good
fire
ruth
had
filled
her
canteen
from
a
spring
not
far
distant
and
offered
the
girls
water
frances
was
trying
to
fasten
branches
into
the
ground
from
which
to
suspend
the
kettle
for
hot
water
it
s
pretty
hard
to
dig
a
deep
enough
hole
without
a
spade
frances
said
miss
phillips
after
she
had
laid
down
her
pack
let
your
fire
die
down
a
little
and
put
two
green
logs
on
each
side
of
it
then
we
can
set
the
kettle
across
them
right
over
the
she
turned
to
ruth
now
what
have
you
for
lunch
she
inquired
doggies
rolls
cocoa
we
have
that
in
the
thermos
bottle
and
baked
beans
and
a
surprise
for
dessert
baked
beans
exclaimed
lily
what
did
captain
tell
you
oh
they
re
not
that
kind
laughingly
explained
ethel
they
re
all
cooked
by
heinz
we
only
have
to
heat
them
the
girls
dropped
the
can
in
the
hot
water
in
the
kettle
and
each
proceeded
to
get
a
stick
on
which
to
toast
the
sausages
soon
they
were
eating
hungrily
tell
us
how
you
liked
our
trail
said
ruth
it
was
great
said
miss
phillips
by
the
way
who
found
the
most
signs
i
believe
edith
did
didn
t
you
asked
dorothy
well
i
found
eight
did
anybody
get
more
than
that
no
one
had
and
edith
was
congratulated
now
guess
girls
what
we
ve
got
for
dessert
apples
no
better
than
that
cake
no
still
better
pie
yes
what
kind
hot
mince
pie
we
covered
it
up
and
put
it
among
the
coals
but
you
ve
got
to
eat
it
with
your
that
s
easy
exclaimed
dorothy
as
ethel
handed
two
pies
to
miss
phillips
to
cut
with
marian
s
ruth
you
and
ethel
are
certainly
dandies
said
helen
but
do
tell
us
how
you
ever
got
all
this
wonderful
feed
for
two
dollars
well
we
didn
t
replied
ruth
mother
sent
me
the
pies
this
and
that
accounts
for
the
reason
they
are
so
good
exclaimed
lily
i
thought
you
couldn
t
get
pies
like
these
at
the
village
girls
suggested
frances
let
s
write
henry
a
note
of
thanks
when
we
get
back
to
school
and
all
sign
now
captain
said
marian
after
they
had
finished
eating
do
tell
us
about
some
of
your
plans
for
the
yes
do
the
others
urged
well
next
friday
we
admit
our
new
members
from
then
until
spring
vacation
we
will
practice
for
our
play
and
work
for
the
second
class
test
during
spring
vacation
we
are
to
go
to
a
big
party
at
the
boy
scout
how
perfect
exclaimed
ruth
enthusiastically
after
vacation
the
captain
continued
we
will
give
our
play
and
study
for
merit
badge
examinations
and
take
some
hikes
maybe
one
hike
learning
about
trees
and
flowers
and
if
any
of
you
girls
want
to
go
out
for
the
pioneer
badge
the
boy
scouts
said
they
would
show
us
how
to
build
a
it
would
be
wonderful
to
have
our
own
cabin
said
ethel
and
of
course
you
know
after
that
comes
vacation
and
our
week
of
camping
but
nobody
can
go
camping
who
is
not
at
least
a
oh
it
s
all
so
exciting
exclaimed
ruth
i
m
so
glad
i
m
a
girl
scout
i
d
be
perfectly
happy
if
marjorie
were
in
it
too
sighed
lily
perhaps
she
will
be
soon
said
frances
encouragingly
let
s
hope
so
ruth
blushed
at
this
remark
but
no
one
noticed
her
embarrassment
she
hastily
changed
the
subject
tell
us
a
story
captain
she
suggested
what
kind
of
story
would
you
like
asked
miss
phillips
oh
one
about
the
answered
ruth
well
we
mustn
t
sit
here
long
the
fire
is
beginning
to
die
but
i
ll
tell
you
a
story
of
ernest
thompson
seton
s
it
s
in
his
book
called
two
little
savages
a
boy
s
book
but
one
which
i
think
you
girls
would
enjoy
this
story
is
about
an
indian
squaw
who
was
taken
prisoner
by
some
tribe
way
up
north
they
marched
her
five
hundred
miles
away
but
one
night
she
escaped
and
set
out
not
on
the
home
trail
for
she
knew
they
would
follow
that
way
and
kill
her
but
to
one
side
she
didn
t
know
the
country
and
got
lost
she
had
no
weapons
but
a
knife
and
no
food
but
berries
she
went
as
fast
as
she
could
for
several
days
till
a
rainstorm
came
and
then
she
felt
safe
because
she
knew
her
enemies
could
not
trail
her
now
but
winter
was
approaching
and
she
could
not
get
home
before
it
came
so
she
set
to
work
right
where
she
was
can
you
girls
imagine
yourselves
in
such
a
position
all
alone
in
the
woods
no
shelter
no
food
no
extra
clothing
and
the
cold
weather
coming
on
fast
frances
shuddered
i
guess
most
of
us
would
soon
give
up
and
die
she
said
we
probably
would
though
maybe
not
after
we
have
learned
the
principles
of
scouting
well
anyway
she
made
a
wigwam
of
birch
bark
and
a
fire
by
rubbing
sticks
together
as
you
saw
two
of
the
boy
scouts
do
only
she
used
the
lace
of
her
moccasin
for
a
she
made
snares
of
the
inner
bark
of
the
willow
and
of
spruce
roots
and
deadfalls
too
for
rabbits
she
was
starving
sometimes
at
first
but
she
ate
the
buds
and
inner
bark
of
birch
trees
till
she
found
a
place
where
there
were
lots
of
rabbits
and
when
she
caught
some
she
used
every
scrap
of
them
she
made
a
of
the
sinews
and
hook
of
the
bones
and
teeth
lashed
together
with
sinew
and
spruce
gum
she
made
a
cloak
of
rabbit
skins
sewed
with
needles
of
rabbit
bone
and
thread
of
rabbit
sinew
and
a
lot
of
dishes
of
birch
bark
sewed
with
spruce
roots
she
spent
the
whole
winter
there
alone
and
when
the
spring
came
she
was
found
by
samuel
hearne
the
great
traveler
her
precious
knife
was
worn
down
but
she
was
fat
and
happy
and
ready
to
set
out
for
her
own
and
is
that
a
true
story
asked
ruth
after
a
silence
of
a
minute
or
two
yes
replied
miss
phillips
wasn
t
she
wonderful
the
girls
thanked
their
captain
for
the
interesting
tale
and
frances
led
in
the
scout
yell
they
sang
one
or
two
of
their
favorite
songs
as
they
put
out
the
fire
and
buried
the
tin
cans
and
refuse
they
could
not
burn
miss
phillips
congratulated
them
on
the
appearance
of
the
spot
a
scout
leaves
the
place
in
perfect
order
after
she
has
camped
there
she
said
approvingly
it
was
a
happy
weary
crowd
that
trudged
into
school
that
night
but
after
they
had
bathed
and
dressed
for
dinner
they
felt
better
though
as
lily
remarked
glad
that
the
next
day
was
and
the
day
after
is
monday
said
marjorie
excitedly
and
we
ll
know
our
marks
chapter
xvii
marjorie
s
disappointment
morning
exercises
at
miss
allen
s
always
began
with
the
singing
of
a
hymn
followed
by
reading
from
the
bible
by
one
of
the
teachers
no
matter
what
events
were
to
come
after
this
custom
was
never
altered
once
in
two
months
the
students
received
their
reports
with
due
formality
when
everyone
was
in
the
assembly
room
miss
allen
s
secretary
carried
the
pile
of
white
envelopes
on
to
the
platform
and
after
the
religious
exercises
were
concluded
the
principal
read
the
names
of
the
girls
in
the
order
of
their
averages
and
they
came
forward
to
receive
the
reports
up
to
this
time
marjorie
had
never
been
particularly
interested
in
the
ceremony
she
always
wanted
to
pass
but
she
rather
regarded
those
girls
whose
marks
ranged
from
eighty
to
ninety
per
cent
as
a
little
queer
they
must
be
abnormal
if
they
were
more
interested
in
mathematics
and
latin
than
in
hockey
and
but
this
monday
morning
after
the
latin
test
she
felt
that
she
had
never
cared
about
anything
so
much
before
as
she
cared
for
her
term
average
she
was
so
nervous
that
she
could
have
cried
out
while
the
girls
droned
through
four
stanzas
of
the
hymn
the
music
teacher
had
selected
she
glanced
apprehensively
at
the
secretary
but
failed
to
see
the
usual
pile
of
white
envelopes
on
the
chair
beside
her
then
resolutely
putting
her
doubts
aside
she
attempted
to
join
in
the
singing
finally
it
was
over
miss
allen
rose
and
walked
to
the
front
of
the
platform
but
contrary
to
her
usual
custom
the
secretary
kept
her
seat
something
was
wrong
marjorie
sensed
it
even
before
miss
allen
began
to
explain
girls
she
said
slowly
fingering
her
i
am
very
sorry
to
say
that
you
will
not
receive
your
marks
until
we
received
miss
white
s
list
of
latin
test
averages
only
so
even
though
miss
smith
will
work
on
them
all
day
in
the
office
we
can
t
have
them
ready
before
late
this
afternoon
but
as
soon
as
she
has
them
made
up
she
will
give
the
list
of
girls
eligible
for
the
scout
troop
to
miss
phillips
and
perhaps
we
can
announce
the
new
candidates
at
dinner
but
you
may
come
to
assembly
prepared
to
receive
your
when
miss
allen
stopped
speaking
marjorie
discovered
that
she
was
literally
shaking
all
over
why
i
never
cared
half
so
much
about
making
the
sorority
she
said
to
herself
i
wonder
if
ruth
felt
that
way
over
it
and
lily
too
poor
girls
i
wish
i
had
been
more
sympathetic
but
i
didn
t
no
day
ever
seemed
so
long
to
marjorie
but
it
went
all
too
quickly
for
ruth
who
was
glad
to
have
the
moment
postponed
when
marjorie
learned
of
her
disappointment
once
or
twice
she
was
inclined
to
regret
her
action
and
her
conscience
told
her
that
she
had
broken
the
scout
s
first
law
that
her
honor
is
to
be
trusted
but
she
always
succeeded
in
justifying
herself
by
thinking
marjorie
was
glad
i
didn
t
make
the
sorority
and
probably
would
have
done
the
same
thing
to
me
if
it
had
been
necessary
she
remembered
the
and
the
dance
and
marjorie
s
indifference
during
the
past
months
and
she
gritted
her
teeth
and
said
she
was
glad
for
what
she
had
done
she
tried
to
avoid
marjorie
but
as
so
often
happens
she
met
both
lily
and
marjorie
in
the
pool
miss
phillips
was
sitting
on
the
bench
superintending
the
hour
in
about
a
month
said
miss
phillips
to
the
girls
at
the
deep
end
after
spring
vacation
season
starts
and
then
we
play
miss
martin
s
school
and
if
you
girls
don
t
beat
them
this
time
i
believe
i
ll
resign
ruth
was
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
dangling
her
feet
and
lily
and
marjorie
were
making
attempts
to
tread
water
but
every
few
minutes
they
reached
for
the
all
the
while
they
were
listening
to
miss
phillips
marjorie
looked
frightened
oh
don
t
do
that
miss
phillips
why
we
d
do
anything
to
prevent
that
i
do
believe
the
whole
school
d
turn
out
every
day
to
practice
if
they
thought
that
would
prevent
you
from
leaving
thanks
for
the
compliment
said
miss
phillips
but
i
really
do
think
the
girls
have
a
different
spirit
now
from
last
fall
not
about
me
but
athletics
and
lessons
and
it
s
all
because
we
have
substituted
a
splendid
democratic
american
organization
for
that
sickly
snobbish
thing
that
used
to
exist
i
mean
φαβ
to
take
the
girls
hearts
and
their
time
and
their
money
and
give
them
nothing
in
return
in
other
words
said
ruth
proudly
thanks
to
me
yes
thanks
to
you
ruth
and
to
miss
allen
and
to
juliette
lowe
the
founder
of
the
girl
scouts
noticing
that
marjorie
had
seemed
somewhat
embarrassed
at
her
arraignment
of
the
sorority
and
was
swimming
off
in
the
opposite
direction
miss
phillips
added
hastily
and
we
re
all
hoping
marjorie
dear
that
by
this
time
night
you
ll
be
among
the
candidates
i
m
only
waiting
for
the
list
marjorie
flushed
with
pleasure
it
was
something
to
be
called
dear
by
miss
phillips
even
if
she
never
made
the
troop
marjorie
s
going
to
make
it
said
lily
why
with
the
way
she
s
studied
she
couldn
t
help
before
the
teacher
could
say
anything
further
a
messenger
from
the
office
entered
and
handed
her
an
envelope
glancing
hastily
at
its
contents
she
rose
and
issued
the
command
all
out
of
the
pool
and
stood
until
the
girls
had
filed
out
then
she
extinguished
the
light
and
went
into
her
office
and
in
five
minutes
she
will
know
my
fate
whispered
marjorie
to
lily
as
the
girls
opened
their
lockers
everybody
was
in
high
spirits
at
dinner
that
evening
the
girls
were
happy
with
expectation
and
this
feeling
was
greatly
increased
when
miss
white
entered
in
the
middle
of
the
meal
with
her
coat
and
hat
on
and
showed
plainly
by
her
happy
smile
that
everything
was
right
at
home
it
was
indeed
a
fitting
time
for
miss
allen
to
inform
the
lucky
candidates
of
their
election
to
the
girl
scout
troop
before
i
announce
the
names
of
the
new
candidates
she
said
let
me
tell
you
that
miss
martin
s
school
is
watching
our
girl
scout
troop
carefully
and
from
our
success
will
decide
whether
or
not
to
start
one
of
their
own
next
year
it
is
a
big
responsibility
girls
i
would
like
every
student
in
my
school
to
be
a
scout
if
she
would
try
to
live
up
to
the
pledge
and
laws
but
at
the
same
time
i
want
to
keep
the
standard
very
high
so
we
are
going
slowly
i
am
glad
to
announce
that
eight
girls
another
whole
patrol
have
qualified
and
as
i
read
the
names
i
would
like
the
girls
to
stand
senior
lucy
graham
juniors
elsie
lorimer
emily
rankin
mary
ridgeway
sophomores
vivien
vansciver
ada
mearns
freshmen
anna
cane
doris
everybody
clapped
except
marjorie
she
sat
perfectly
still
the
room
seemed
to
go
around
and
around
and
she
thought
she
was
going
to
faint
the
girls
all
got
up
and
pressed
over
to
their
friends
to
congratulate
them
somehow
marjorie
realized
that
she
should
not
sit
any
longer
and
she
stood
up
but
in
a
second
lily
was
by
her
side
her
arm
linked
in
hers
come
on
out
she
said
don
t
worry
marj
surely
there
has
been
a
mistake
wait
till
you
get
your
she
literally
led
marjorie
to
their
room
when
they
reached
it
and
lily
had
closed
the
door
the
unhappy
girl
threw
herself
on
her
cot
weeping
lily
was
unable
to
console
her
it
s
no
use
sobbed
marjorie
i
have
failed
in
my
latin
i
guess
i
tried
too
hard
i
must
have
been
nervous
and
put
down
the
wrong
she
hid
her
face
in
the
pillow
in
a
few
minutes
a
knock
sounded
at
the
door
and
lily
opened
it
preparing
to
say
that
marjorie
had
a
headache
and
to
ask
the
guest
to
call
again
but
it
was
miss
phillips
come
in
said
lily
quietly
approaching
her
s
cot
she
leaned
over
and
said
it
s
miss
phillips
marjorie
to
see
you
please
excuse
me
she
added
discreetly
i
must
go
to
the
the
next
was
one
of
those
short
but
important
times
that
always
stood
out
in
marjorie
s
memory
miss
phillips
sat
down
beside
her
and
taking
her
hand
told
her
it
was
not
a
mistake
that
her
latin
mark
was
so
low
that
she
had
all
but
failed
and
then
she
related
an
instance
in
her
own
life
when
she
had
wanted
so
much
to
succeed
in
an
undertaking
it
was
the
passing
of
a
physical
training
exam
she
had
failed
and
her
money
had
given
out
she
had
been
forced
to
give
up
her
plans
and
go
to
work
in
an
office
but
it
was
my
teacher
she
said
who
made
me
hold
on
to
my
ideal
and
succeed
at
last
and
i
guess
i
was
better
equipped
in
the
marjorie
seemed
calmer
now
so
miss
phillips
continued
in
her
soft
voice
i
shall
never
forget
that
poem
of
edwin
markam
s
do
you
know
his
work
marjorie
that
my
teacher
read
to
me
at
the
time
defeat
may
serve
as
well
as
victory
to
shake
the
soul
and
let
the
glory
out
when
the
great
oak
is
straining
in
the
wind
the
boughs
drink
in
new
beauty
and
the
trunk
sends
down
a
deeper
root
on
the
windward
side
only
the
soul
that
knows
the
mighty
grief
can
know
the
mighty
rapture
sorrows
come
to
stretch
out
spaces
in
the
heart
for
and
i
believe
sometimes
that
defeat
is
just
the
thing
we
miss
phillips
talked
a
long
time
with
marjorie
and
held
before
her
a
new
race
to
pursue
so
that
when
lily
came
back
from
the
library
and
the
teacher
rose
to
go
marjorie
seemed
quite
happy
and
promised
to
try
again
the
next
day
she
received
her
report
with
in
latin
but
she
never
saw
her
paper
for
miss
white
had
burned
it
with
the
others
after
she
had
copied
the
marks
and
sent
them
to
miss
allen
chapter
xviii
the
test
the
new
scout
candidates
soon
passed
their
tenderfoot
test
and
registered
at
national
headquarters
as
regular
members
of
pansy
troop
lucy
graham
the
senior
was
elected
patrol
leader
of
the
new
patrol
and
doris
sands
received
the
office
of
corporal
the
last
meeting
before
spring
vacation
was
held
after
the
usual
preliminary
business
had
been
concluded
captain
phillips
said
that
she
had
several
interesting
announcements
to
make
she
said
instead
of
our
usual
outing
we
are
going
down
in
the
village
to
burd
s
house
to
cook
our
own
supper
you
know
every
girl
has
to
cook
something
satisfactorily
as
a
part
of
her
test
and
i
wasn
t
quite
sure
how
to
give
you
the
opportunity
when
my
friend
burd
came
to
the
rescue
and
offered
us
her
kitchen
for
night
while
she
and
the
rest
of
her
family
are
away
now
she
continued
after
the
girls
had
discussed
her
proposition
for
several
minutes
i
have
something
to
tell
you
that
i
know
will
interest
you
all
i
have
chosen
the
play
we
are
going
to
give
after
spring
vacation
oh
what
is
it
cried
ruth
informally
forgetting
the
usual
ceremony
of
address
but
miss
phillips
did
not
notice
the
departure
from
discipline
perhaps
too
she
was
too
much
interested
in
her
subject
to
be
aware
of
it
everygirl
she
replied
holding
up
a
copy
of
the
play
i
think
you
are
going
to
like
it
and
if
you
do
well
with
it
it
will
surely
bring
credit
to
the
whole
school
she
opened
the
pamphlet
she
was
holding
and
read
off
a
list
of
symbolic
characters
of
course
the
play
is
an
allegory
everygirl
just
represents
any
girl
who
meets
with
good
and
evil
and
who
has
to
choose
her
companions
and
her
course
through
life
there
are
a
good
many
parts
to
the
play
so
i
hope
you
will
all
be
able
to
be
in
it
of
course
the
main
part
is
that
of
everygirl
the
captain
said
frances
rising
and
saluting
please
tell
me
how
you
are
going
to
select
the
girls
for
the
parts
and
whether
we
shall
be
able
to
study
them
over
spring
i
am
going
to
select
the
characters
at
a
afternoon
so
will
everybody
please
come
to
the
gym
right
after
lunch
i
used
to
be
in
plays
at
home
remarked
ruth
i
suppose
that
will
help
won
t
it
we
ll
see
replied
miss
phillips
now
one
thing
more
before
we
take
our
tests
i
want
to
arrange
about
our
cabin
party
with
the
boy
scouts
school
reopens
april
fifteenth
which
is
on
wednesday
so
all
the
girl
scouts
are
to
come
back
here
on
tuesday
morning
get
here
before
twelve
o
clock
the
housekeeper
rock
is
going
to
give
us
a
light
lunch
and
we
are
to
change
into
our
scout
uniforms
take
a
trolley
to
bear
s
hill
and
hike
to
the
cabin
each
girl
is
to
bring
her
own
and
wear
warm
clothes
the
boy
scouts
prepare
the
ruth
s
eyes
danced
how
many
boy
scouts
are
there
she
asked
i
think
they
have
a
full
troop
four
patrols
boys
but
they
are
going
to
take
only
the
sixteen
with
the
highest
standing
their
scoutmaster
remington
told
me
all
the
boys
were
crazy
to
go
but
he
didn
t
want
their
numbers
to
overwhelm
us
now
girls
unless
there
are
some
important
questions
we
will
not
talk
about
these
things
any
longer
but
will
prepare
to
take
the
written
part
of
the
test
and
before
i
forget
it
will
you
bring
your
samples
of
sewing
crocheting
and
knitting
over
to
the
gym
afternoon
for
me
to
examine
then
after
supper
night
i
ought
to
be
able
to
announce
the
names
of
the
girls
who
have
passed
the
ethel
arose
excitedly
captain
she
said
the
handbook
says
we
need
submit
knitting
crocheting
so
we
don
t
have
to
bring
both
do
we
scout
todd
answered
miss
phillips
if
you
remember
correctly
i
announced
several
months
ago
that
no
girl
in
pansy
troop
could
become
a
scout
without
submitting
samples
of
knitting
and
crocheting
you
all
know
our
standards
are
very
high
and
miss
allen
and
i
both
agreed
that
in
all
the
cases
where
the
handbook
gave
a
choice
of
two
alternatives
we
would
require
both
it
is
entirely
fair
because
it
is
the
same
for
everybody
do
you
understand
ruth
sat
perfectly
still
but
she
saw
her
hopes
of
wearing
the
green
clover
badge
home
at
vacation
fading
for
though
she
knit
splendidly
she
had
never
done
a
stitch
of
crocheting
in
her
life
miss
phillips
distributed
the
paper
and
the
girls
gave
their
attention
to
the
written
part
of
the
test
as
they
were
getting
ready
for
lunch
the
next
day
ethel
asked
ruth
whether
she
could
crochet
yes
replied
ruth
after
a
slight
hesitation
and
have
you
something
ready
to
take
this
afternoon
ruth
opened
her
drawer
and
took
out
a
square
of
filet
i
haven
t
done
much
of
it
but
i
guess
it
s
enough
to
show
captain
phillips
what
i
can
do
how
pretty
said
ethel
admiringly
oh
ruth
couldn
t
you
teach
me
i
do
so
want
to
get
that
badge
i
d
love
to
replied
ruth
but
i
can
t
before
because
it
s
pretty
hard
to
learn
and
i
want
to
practice
for
the
play
i
think
i
stand
chance
of
getting
the
heroine
s
part
if
i
read
it
over
several
times
but
i
wouldn
t
if
marj
wilkinson
were
in
the
troop
she
s
a
peach
at
dramatics
ethel
was
disappointed
but
decided
to
wait
until
spring
vacation
to
learn
she
was
not
however
the
only
girl
to
fail
to
win
the
badge
for
this
reason
when
the
scouts
met
a
few
hours
later
in
the
gym
it
transpired
that
ruth
and
two
others
were
the
only
ones
to
produce
samples
of
their
work
may
i
have
my
crocheting
back
as
soon
as
you
have
inspected
it
captain
asked
ruth
i
want
to
work
on
certainly
replied
miss
phillips
you
can
have
it
now
for
that
the
for
the
play
lasted
all
afternoon
after
each
girl
read
a
number
of
different
parts
miss
phillips
excused
them
but
most
of
the
girls
preferred
to
wait
to
hear
the
results
of
the
captain
s
decisions
finally
a
little
before
five
o
clock
she
read
the
characters
as
she
had
selected
them
and
ruth
was
disappointed
to
hear
that
helen
stewart
was
awarded
the
part
of
her
companions
crowded
around
her
with
congratulations
and
ruth
who
had
resolutely
put
her
own
feelings
aside
remembering
that
a
scout
is
cheerful
was
among
them
in
less
than
half
an
hour
s
time
the
girls
to
accompany
miss
phillips
to
burd
s
home
they
found
it
charming
just
the
sort
of
house
a
girl
dreams
of
having
some
day
with
everything
bright
and
shining
and
new
the
kitchen
was
small
but
several
of
the
girls
took
their
work
into
the
shed
or
the
so
that
all
of
the
sixteen
scouts
were
never
in
it
at
once
miss
phillips
had
very
cleverly
prepared
a
menu
that
required
many
extras
there
was
soup
two
vegetables
cream
sauce
and
gravy
salad
muffins
cocoa
and
dessert
so
that
all
the
girls
had
the
opportunity
to
show
their
skill
in
cooking
miss
phillips
directed
the
work
which
was
fortunate
for
such
inexperienced
cooks
and
everything
turned
out
splendidly
the
dinner
was
a
great
success
as
soon
as
the
soup
was
on
the
table
the
girls
took
off
their
aprons
and
sat
down
each
course
was
served
by
the
girls
who
had
prepared
it
the
appetizing
smell
of
the
food
and
the
excitement
of
the
experiment
made
them
all
hungry
they
laughed
and
chatted
gaily
as
they
ate
their
flushed
faces
testifying
the
joy
of
their
success
when
dessert
had
been
served
miss
phillips
said
i
certainly
want
to
congratulate
you
all
on
your
splendid
dinner
i
can
see
already
that
no
man
who
marries
a
girl
scout
of
pansy
troop
ever
need
worry
about
his
future
the
girls
laughed
and
ethel
looked
significantly
at
doris
as
if
to
indicate
that
she
would
probably
be
the
first
to
have
the
chance
to
prove
this
fact
i
wish
i
could
pass
you
all
on
part
of
your
test
continued
miss
phillips
as
easily
as
i
can
on
your
cooking
but
unfortunately
i
can
award
only
three
green
clovers
to
helen
stewart
ruth
henry
and
doris
sands
she
paused
while
the
girls
clapped
producing
three
badges
from
the
pocket
of
her
uniform
she
requested
the
three
girls
to
stand
up
we
will
have
the
formal
ceremony
the
first
friday
after
spring
vacation
but
i
know
that
you
girls
are
anxious
to
wear
your
badges
at
the
cabin
party
so
i
am
going
to
give
them
to
you
now
sew
them
on
your
left
sleeve
she
concluded
after
the
dishes
had
been
cleared
away
and
the
and
kitchen
made
spotless
the
girls
sang
some
songs
around
the
piano
in
the
and
then
proceeded
to
get
ready
to
go
back
to
the
school
the
plays
will
be
here
by
monday
said
miss
phillips
as
she
bade
the
girls
good
night
be
sure
to
get
your
copies
to
take
home
with
the
next
morning
ruth
told
ethel
that
she
had
a
headache
and
intended
to
ask
for
permission
to
stay
away
from
church
too
much
party
i
guess
said
ethel
as
she
put
on
her
hat
you
better
lie
down
till
noon
but
it
was
not
the
result
of
the
party
that
was
keeping
ruth
at
home
she
had
an
important
errand
to
perform
for
which
she
needed
the
desertion
of
sunday
morning
she
waited
until
all
was
quiet
in
the
hall
then
taking
a
small
article
out
of
her
bureau
drawer
she
walked
quickly
over
to
marjorie
s
room
she
was
so
sure
that
the
latter
would
be
at
church
that
she
opened
the
door
without
knocking
to
her
great
surprise
marjorie
suddenly
sat
up
in
bed
hullo
ruth
she
exclaimed
what
time
is
it
i
guess
i
must
have
overslept
lily
went
over
to
stay
all
night
with
helen
stewart
so
i
hadn
t
anybody
to
waken
ruth
was
extremely
taken
back
by
marjorie
s
presence
but
concealed
her
embarrassment
and
took
advantage
of
the
other
girl
s
sleepiness
to
drop
unnoticed
the
article
she
held
in
her
hand
behind
one
of
the
pillows
on
lily
s
cot
it
s
after
eleven
o
clock
you
ll
never
make
church
now
she
said
eleven
o
clock
cried
marjorie
jumping
out
of
bed
oh
my
goodness
another
unexcused
absence
marj
said
ruth
slowly
can
i
borrow
your
tales
from
shakespeare
i
got
permission
to
stay
home
for
a
headache
but
i
m
better
now
and
i
want
to
look
up
surely
it
s
down
on
the
bottom
shelf
you
don
t
mind
if
i
hurry
no
indeed
i
have
to
go
anyhow
good
luck
to
you
when
marjorie
and
lily
returned
together
from
church
at
noon
the
first
thing
that
struck
lily
s
eye
after
she
sat
down
on
her
cot
was
marjorie
s
lost
crocheting
here
s
your
square
of
filet
marj
she
exclaimed
picking
up
the
piece
it
was
behind
the
pillow
i
wonder
how
long
it
s
been
there
and
we
never
saw
it
but
i
did
look
there
before
protested
marjorie
anyway
she
added
putting
it
into
her
work
bag
i
m
glad
to
have
it
to
take
home
with
chapter
xix
the
boy
scouts
entertain
when
the
girls
were
ready
to
take
the
train
which
was
to
carry
them
home
for
the
spring
holidays
it
was
ruth
who
desired
to
avoid
marjorie
s
company
but
she
was
not
so
successful
as
the
latter
had
been
on
their
last
journey
probably
this
was
due
to
the
fact
that
she
was
not
foresighted
enough
to
secure
an
early
dismissal
the
girls
boarded
the
train
together
but
marjorie
sat
with
lily
as
far
as
the
junction
when
however
the
time
to
change
trains
arrived
ruth
found
herself
alone
on
the
station
platform
with
marjorie
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
be
sociable
besides
marjorie
must
not
suspect
that
anything
had
happened
in
their
relationship
to
alter
their
friendliness
the
coach
they
entered
was
comparatively
empty
marjorie
chose
a
seat
by
the
window
and
ruth
sat
down
beside
her
i
believe
i
ll
do
my
crocheting
said
marjorie
opening
her
velvet
and
taking
out
a
square
of
filet
that
was
all
too
familiar
to
ruth
i
lost
it
last
week
behind
lily
s
cot
and
i
haven
t
done
nearly
so
much
as
i
wanted
to
i
m
making
a
camisole
top
for
miss
phillips
for
her
birthday
do
you
think
she
ll
like
it
ruth
s
face
became
scarlet
fortunately
for
her
the
other
girl
was
too
busy
with
her
work
to
notice
she
leaned
over
and
pretended
to
button
her
spat
yes
it
s
lovely
marj
she
replied
when
is
her
birthday
it
s
the
sixteenth
of
april
i
want
to
give
it
to
her
the
day
we
get
back
would
you
buy
the
silk
and
make
it
up
or
give
it
to
her
just
as
it
is
the
girls
discussed
the
matter
and
ruth
suggested
a
way
of
making
it
if
i
come
over
next
week
asked
ruth
will
you
show
me
that
pattern
i
d
like
to
make
it
for
certainly
i
never
knew
you
could
crochet
till
lily
told
me
you
and
helen
and
doris
were
the
only
ones
in
the
troop
who
won
their
badges
on
that
yes
said
ruth
quite
composed
by
now
i
learned
the
last
time
i
was
home
you
see
i
didn
t
have
any
to
keep
me
busy
so
i
thought
i
might
as
well
do
something
useful
the
conversation
drifted
to
swimming
and
and
finally
to
the
girl
scout
troop
ruth
could
not
refrain
from
telling
marjorie
all
about
the
good
times
that
were
in
store
for
her
but
maybe
you
ll
be
a
scout
before
the
play
comes
off
marj
she
suggested
how
many
more
times
do
you
think
the
troop
will
take
in
new
members
this
year
only
once
i
guess
but
then
i
m
not
sure
but
of
course
nobody
can
go
camping
who
isn
t
at
least
a
don
t
worry
about
that
if
i
ever
get
in
i
won
t
stop
till
i
m
a
scout
said
marjorie
emphatically
it
would
be
fun
to
race
to
see
who
won
it
first
if
you
were
only
in
the
troop
observed
ruth
marjorie
folded
up
her
crocheting
and
looked
dismally
out
of
the
window
sometimes
i
think
i
ll
never
make
it
i
don
t
know
how
to
work
any
harder
than
i
did
for
that
last
latin
oh
i
guess
you
must
have
been
nervous
i
ll
bet
you
know
as
much
as
i
do
now
about
prose
composition
but
you
simply
lost
your
maybe
i
be
a
sport
and
try
again
get
jack
to
help
you
he
ought
to
be
able
to
he
s
a
year
ahead
of
here
we
are
at
last
cried
marjorie
jumping
up
and
reaching
for
her
bag
and
here
are
our
families
to
meet
us
wilkinson
was
obviously
glad
to
see
the
girls
together
again
and
henry
tried
to
conceal
the
feeling
of
pride
she
experienced
at
the
thought
of
her
own
daughter
s
success
compared
with
the
other
girl
s
failure
a
good
deal
has
happened
since
christmas
hasn
t
it
marjorie
said
wilkinson
after
they
were
comfortably
seated
in
the
machine
yes
answered
marjorie
i
m
no
longer
a
sorority
so
i
understand
but
are
you
a
girl
scout
not
yet
my
latin
oh
yes
i
know
you
ll
surely
be
able
to
pull
that
up
soon
if
did
ruth
make
the
troop
interrupted
jack
yes
she
s
a
scout
good
for
her
said
jack
i
got
my
pin
on
friday
night
he
added
proudly
oh
jack
i
m
so
glad
did
roger
make
it
too
yes
we
re
both
in
the
troop
so
is
doris
laughed
marjorie
the
holidays
passed
rather
quietly
for
marjorie
she
studied
from
a
latin
book
she
had
brought
home
with
her
and
worked
on
her
crochet
true
to
her
promise
ruth
came
over
to
copy
her
pattern
and
proved
her
ability
in
the
new
accomplishment
ruth
and
jack
discussed
the
party
at
the
cabin
but
jack
regretted
that
both
he
and
roger
were
too
new
to
be
included
among
the
lucky
participants
it
was
with
a
very
heavy
heart
that
marjorie
watched
ruth
pass
her
house
the
tuesday
before
school
bound
for
the
cabin
party
of
the
scouts
jack
rushed
out
to
carry
her
suitcase
to
the
station
and
marjorie
wiped
away
a
tear
as
she
turned
again
to
her
latin
grammar
the
girl
scouts
met
in
the
and
made
a
pretence
at
eating
the
lunch
rock
had
provided
but
they
were
all
too
impatient
to
get
started
to
care
to
waste
any
unnecessary
time
so
after
fifteen
minutes
had
elapsed
miss
phillips
announced
her
intention
of
starting
when
the
girls
got
off
the
trolley
at
the
foot
of
bear
s
hill
they
found
two
of
the
boy
scouts
waiting
for
them
as
they
came
forward
the
girls
of
the
first
patrol
identified
them
as
david
conner
and
russell
henderson
after
the
usual
ceremony
of
greeting
david
said
our
boys
have
laid
a
trail
for
you
to
follow
if
you
don
t
miss
any
of
the
signals
we
ought
to
reach
the
cabin
in
fifteen
minutes
time
the
girls
were
glad
of
their
former
experience
in
following
a
trail
and
succeeded
in
discovering
all
the
signs
and
keeping
on
the
path
indicated
once
or
twice
they
found
little
notes
of
direction
but
aside
from
these
the
signals
were
identical
with
those
miss
phillips
had
taught
them
part
of
the
way
david
walked
with
ethel
isn
t
miss
wilkinson
a
scout
yet
he
asked
no
replied
ethel
she
lost
out
again
somebody
s
going
to
be
disappointed
remarked
david
beginning
to
whistle
somebody
else
i
know
never
gets
left
when
there
s
a
girl
around
exclaimed
a
voice
behind
them
which
david
identified
as
russell
s
without
looking
around
in
a
few
minutes
the
party
came
in
sight
of
the
cabin
before
they
could
distinguish
it
from
the
trees
that
surrounded
it
they
saw
two
red
and
white
flags
sending
a
message
of
welcome
girl
scouts
hadley
s
on
the
job
as
usual
muttered
russell
as
the
girls
who
knew
the
code
interpreted
the
message
to
the
others
the
cabin
was
built
of
logs
and
surrounded
by
tall
trees
the
brush
had
been
cleared
away
leaving
an
open
space
in
front
large
enough
for
the
scouts
to
build
an
oven
and
to
arrange
an
eating
place
the
spring
ran
below
the
cabin
the
other
boys
who
had
visited
miss
allen
s
came
forward
and
greeted
the
girls
and
introduced
the
rest
of
the
scouts
and
remington
the
scoutmaster
several
of
the
boys
conducted
their
guests
to
the
inside
of
the
cabin
where
they
removed
their
heavier
wraps
the
interior
of
the
cabin
which
had
a
stone
fireplace
and
a
wooden
floor
was
fixed
up
attractively
with
box
furniture
made
by
the
boys
themselves
several
shelves
in
one
corner
held
the
supplies
it
s
lovely
exclaimed
ethel
enthusiastically
as
she
sat
down
on
the
bench
in
front
of
the
fireplace
where
do
you
sleep
asked
lily
with
a
puzzled
look
surely
sixteen
boys
couldn
t
all
find
room
on
the
floor
we
sleep
in
tents
when
we
stay
here
all
night
said
john
except
of
course
when
a
candidate
is
sent
out
here
on
probation
then
he
sleeps
on
that
cot
remington
appeared
at
the
doorway
as
soon
as
you
get
rested
we
want
to
play
some
scout
games
he
said
all
the
scouts
except
the
squad
who
were
preparing
the
dinner
played
games
until
almost
dusk
then
a
whistle
signal
sounded
which
john
interpreted
as
get
ready
for
mess
and
the
girls
followed
miss
phillips
to
the
stream
to
wash
and
make
themselves
presentable
for
supper
the
supper
was
a
splendid
one
much
more
pretentious
than
that
which
represented
the
girls
usual
idea
of
a
camp
mess
there
was
broiled
steak
baked
potatoes
baked
beans
cocoa
rolls
and
chocolate
cake
i
never
knew
boys
could
cook
like
this
said
frances
why
it
s
wonderful
the
girls
wanted
to
help
clear
things
away
but
their
offer
was
refused
two
or
three
of
the
boys
built
up
the
fire
and
in
a
few
minutes
everyone
was
grouped
around
it
singing
and
talking
john
hadley
came
over
and
sat
beside
doris
it
s
too
bad
roger
couldn
t
be
here
he
said
but
you
see
he
s
one
of
the
newer
members
of
the
troop
i
daresay
you
ll
see
him
at
the
next
doris
laughed
gaily
don
t
worry
about
me
hadley
she
said
i
m
having
a
wonderful
but
with
her
naturally
sympathetic
disposition
she
was
quick
to
realize
that
john
was
not
so
happy
and
she
tactfully
turned
the
conversation
in
the
direction
in
which
he
was
interested
namely
to
marjorie
she
explained
as
well
as
she
could
about
marjorie
s
failure
but
as
she
never
had
been
able
to
understand
it
herself
she
was
not
very
successful
in
convincing
john
of
the
cause
about
eight
o
clock
remington
called
for
stunts
and
started
by
telling
a
funny
story
himself
miss
phillips
followed
with
a
negro
song
in
dialect
ruth
and
ethel
gave
a
dialogue
and
several
of
the
boys
performed
gymnastic
feats
at
nine
o
clock
miss
phillips
reluctantly
rose
to
go
she
thanked
the
boys
and
invited
them
to
the
play
and
some
day
she
added
we
want
to
entertain
our
boys
wish
to
offer
the
girl
scouts
of
pansy
troop
the
use
of
our
cabin
and
its
equipment
for
a
week
this
summer
said
remington
after
he
had
acknowledged
miss
phillips
s
invitations
the
girls
all
clapped
it
seemed
too
wonderful
to
be
true
the
nicest
time
i
ever
had
in
my
life
said
lily
as
they
were
riding
home
on
the
trolley
but
she
added
the
phrase
which
ruth
had
come
to
hate
if
only
marjorie
could
have
come
along
chapter
xx
marjorie
s
suspicions
when
the
scouts
reached
the
school
they
found
a
number
of
the
other
girls
back
from
their
holidays
but
the
halls
seemed
strangely
quiet
and
deserted
and
when
lily
reached
her
room
she
was
overcome
by
a
feeling
of
loneliness
i
wish
marjorie
were
here
she
thought
i
d
love
to
tell
her
all
about
the
party
and
john
s
disappointment
at
not
seeing
and
then
she
began
to
wonder
how
it
would
feel
to
have
a
boy
really
crazy
about
her
she
had
always
been
too
fat
and
unattractive
to
make
many
friends
among
the
opposite
sex
and
being
an
only
child
without
any
brothers
to
introduce
other
boys
to
her
she
always
spent
much
of
her
holidays
alone
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
realized
what
she
had
missed
she
felt
that
other
girls
were
enjoying
privileges
that
she
had
never
known
she
had
scarcely
spoken
more
than
six
words
to
any
boy
at
the
party
and
yet
she
noticed
doris
and
ruth
chatting
and
laughing
with
almost
all
the
boys
as
if
they
had
known
them
all
their
lives
what
was
the
secret
marjorie
must
know
she
had
a
brother
she
would
be
able
to
tell
her
what
interested
them
marjorie
did
not
return
to
the
school
until
the
next
morning
just
in
time
for
opening
assembly
lily
did
not
therefore
have
a
chance
to
talk
with
her
until
lunch
and
then
she
suddenly
discovered
that
she
was
too
shy
or
perhaps
too
proud
to
ask
such
a
question
i
thought
you
d
be
back
yesterday
she
said
as
she
was
getting
ready
for
lunch
i
would
have
only
i
knew
all
my
friends
would
be
away
at
the
party
said
marjorie
besides
i
wanted
to
finish
miss
phillips
s
oh
let
me
see
it
cried
lily
when
will
you
give
it
to
her
morning
i
guess
before
breakfast
if
i
can
catch
her
in
time
i
would
like
to
wish
her
a
happy
birthday
the
very
first
thing
the
girls
linked
arms
and
went
into
the
together
glad
of
the
opportunity
to
talk
with
each
other
again
ethel
todd
who
sat
at
the
same
table
with
them
leaned
towards
marjorie
lowering
her
voice
and
glancing
in
the
direction
of
miss
phillips
s
table
she
said
the
scouts
are
going
to
give
miss
phillips
a
surprise
party
night
in
honor
of
her
birthday
and
marj
we
want
you
in
it
too
we
got
permission
from
miss
allen
meet
at
eight
in
our
room
you
can
bring
a
birthday
present
if
you
want
but
you
don
t
have
to
then
we
re
all
going
over
and
sing
a
little
song
frances
wrote
in
her
honor
a
parody
on
perfect
day
and
go
into
her
room
with
our
presents
and
refreshments
ruth
and
doris
are
buying
everything
the
tax
will
be
about
a
quarter
apiece
you
re
both
in
for
it
yes
indeed
answered
lily
marjorie
hesitated
i
d
love
to
she
said
but
it
doesn
t
seem
exactly
right
i
m
not
a
girl
scout
nonsense
exclaimed
ethel
if
there
is
anything
that
isn
t
right
about
it
it
s
that
you
aren
t
a
girl
scout
i
d
like
to
have
seen
that
latin
paper
i
ll
bet
miss
white
was
all
fussed
about
her
mother
being
sick
and
marked
it
wrong
or
else
got
it
mixed
up
with
some
other
girl
s
paper
you
know
i
have
sometimes
wondered
about
that
myself
said
marjorie
and
especially
since
i
went
over
the
past
lessons
during
spring
vacation
i
can
t
remember
putting
the
wrong
things
down
but
it
is
too
late
now
of
course
even
if
there
had
been
a
why
don
t
you
ask
for
another
test
asked
ethel
oh
i
couldn
t
do
that
i
ll
just
have
to
wait
till
the
end
of
the
year
and
lose
out
on
the
camping
trip
exclaimed
lily
resentfully
it
just
doesn
t
seem
fair
well
go
to
the
party
anyway
pleaded
ethel
thank
goodness
latin
can
t
keep
you
away
from
that
the
girls
had
difficulty
in
keeping
their
secret
from
miss
phillips
but
with
a
great
deal
of
effort
they
managed
to
do
it
it
was
fortunate
however
that
there
was
no
scout
meeting
before
the
event
or
somebody
would
have
been
sure
to
give
the
plan
away
but
as
it
was
she
was
completely
surprised
she
was
sitting
alone
at
her
desk
writing
a
letter
when
as
the
scouts
had
arranged
one
of
the
maids
knocked
at
her
door
and
handed
her
a
box
miss
phillips
wrinkled
her
brows
who
sent
it
she
asked
some
friends
who
would
like
to
come
in
to
see
you
she
answered
what
shall
i
tell
them
i
ll
be
delighted
of
course
are
they
some
of
my
girls
at
this
moment
the
girls
jumped
out
from
around
the
corridor
and
rushed
up
to
miss
phillips
congratulating
her
and
wishing
her
many
happy
returns
of
the
day
while
she
untied
the
box
ethel
closed
the
door
and
frances
led
in
the
parody
of
the
song
which
the
girls
sang
softly
but
distinctly
roses
exclaimed
miss
phillips
lifting
them
out
of
the
box
my
favorite
flowers
after
the
girls
had
seated
themselves
miss
phillips
was
handed
her
presents
she
received
candy
gloves
handkerchiefs
and
fancy
collars
noticing
the
particular
package
which
marjorie
had
given
her
she
left
it
till
last
to
open
just
what
i
wanted
she
said
delighted
as
she
examined
the
camisole
closely
did
you
do
all
that
for
me
marjorie
nodded
and
ruth
began
to
look
after
the
refreshments
in
order
to
hide
her
embarrassment
that
certainly
is
a
pretty
pattern
continued
miss
phillips
why
i
believe
it
is
the
same
one
ruth
has
been
making
isn
t
it
ruth
flushed
but
answered
unconcernedly
yes
i
am
making
a
yoke
for
mother
marjorie
let
me
copy
yes
i
remember
that
was
the
piece
i
examined
for
your
marjorie
opened
her
mouth
in
speechless
amazement
what
did
all
this
mean
ruth
had
only
begun
this
pattern
while
she
was
at
home
for
the
holidays
and
yet
she
had
passed
the
test
several
days
before
she
left
she
glanced
at
ruth
who
was
handing
around
the
cake
in
a
most
indifferent
manner
there
must
be
some
mistake
miss
phillips
must
have
forgotten
after
the
girls
had
eaten
they
sang
once
more
the
song
to
miss
phillips
and
went
out
quietly
when
marjorie
reached
her
room
she
asked
as
casually
as
she
could
do
you
remember
when
i
first
missed
my
crocheting
lily
lily
tried
to
think
it
must
have
been
saturday
before
we
went
home
marj
for
you
were
doing
it
friday
night
while
we
were
at
scout
meeting
why
oh
nothing
i
just
wondered
and
you
found
it
sunday
didn
t
you
yes
when
we
came
home
from
church
aren
t
you
glad
though
i
think
miss
phillips
liked
your
present
best
of
all
marj
thank
you
lily
said
marjorie
absently
but
over
and
over
in
her
mind
she
repeated
and
a
girl
scout
s
honor
is
to
be
trusted
chapter
xxi
the
game
it
is
natural
for
the
younger
girls
of
a
school
to
look
up
to
those
in
the
upper
classes
for
the
freshmen
to
make
one
of
the
juniors
or
seniors
her
ideal
and
it
is
likewise
usual
to
find
the
younger
girl
admiring
the
older
boys
she
happens
to
meet
partly
for
this
reason
perhaps
and
partly
because
he
was
both
genial
and
attractive
ruth
conceived
a
violent
admiration
for
john
hadley
she
had
considered
him
the
scout
at
the
demonstration
in
january
now
after
the
party
at
the
cabin
she
admitted
to
herself
that
she
was
really
crazy
about
true
she
had
not
seen
much
of
him
at
the
party
for
he
sat
beside
doris
after
the
games
were
over
but
she
knew
that
doris
was
pretty
well
smitten
with
roger
harris
and
did
not
allow
the
possibility
of
her
interference
to
worry
her
she
had
never
heard
marjorie
speak
of
him
and
she
had
no
idea
that
his
interest
lay
in
that
direction
she
knew
that
this
year
was
john
s
last
at
the
academy
so
she
planned
to
see
more
of
him
before
it
was
too
late
why
don
t
you
ask
jack
to
go
over
to
miss
martin
s
to
our
game
with
them
and
take
some
of
his
friends
asked
ruth
of
marjorie
a
week
before
the
date
for
which
the
event
was
scheduled
miss
allen
said
the
boys
would
be
allowed
to
oh
i
don
t
know
i
ve
been
too
busy
to
think
about
it
marjorie
because
she
was
both
tall
and
quick
had
been
chosen
for
the
position
of
on
the
school
team
she
had
been
going
out
regularly
to
the
practices
in
the
field
the
girls
at
miss
allen
s
played
and
she
was
in
splendid
trim
for
the
game
her
cheeks
glowed
and
her
eyes
sparkled
while
she
played
had
she
been
a
vain
girl
she
would
have
realized
that
under
no
other
circumstance
could
she
appear
so
attractive
go
on
write
to
jack
pleaded
ruth
why
he
d
love
to
see
you
play
ask
him
to
bring
some
of
the
other
scouts
but
i
wouldn
t
be
able
to
look
after
them
i
m
in
the
game
of
course
that
s
why
he
ought
to
be
allowed
to
come
i
ll
entertain
them
and
ask
doris
to
all
right
agreed
marjorie
who
else
shall
i
suggest
roger
harris
of
course
for
doris
and
anybody
else
how
about
the
senior
patrol
leader
what
was
his
name
marjorie
blushed
john
hadley
yes
why
not
all
right
but
i
guess
i
ll
tell
jack
to
take
whoever
he
the
game
was
scheduled
for
the
second
saturday
in
may
all
of
the
girls
on
the
team
except
marjorie
were
girl
scouts
ethel
todd
and
edith
evans
played
forward
ada
mearns
and
dorothy
maxwell
were
the
guards
and
frances
wright
acted
as
side
center
incidentally
marjorie
was
the
only
freshman
on
the
team
although
one
other
girl
of
her
own
class
served
as
a
substitute
jack
accepted
his
sister
s
suggestion
gladly
he
wrote
that
he
would
arrive
at
miss
martin
s
school
with
john
and
roger
immediately
after
lunch
marjorie
took
the
letter
to
ruth
it
s
your
party
she
said
i
won
t
even
be
able
to
meet
them
miss
phillips
is
going
to
take
us
over
early
to
get
a
chance
to
try
the
field
and
then
miss
martin
s
team
is
giving
us
a
special
lunch
in
their
all
right
agreed
ruth
i
ll
look
after
them
by
the
way
is
there
any
girl
jack
specially
likes
so
i
could
invite
her
to
go
with
doris
and
me
marjorie
laughed
i
think
he
always
specially
liked
you
ruth
no
i
mean
somebody
else
he
met
some
of
the
girls
at
your
marjorie
tried
to
think
finally
she
shook
her
head
i
m
afraid
there
isn
t
ruth
ask
whoever
else
you
please
to
sit
with
you
all
i
know
is
i
can
t
ruth
decided
to
ask
evelyn
hopkins
the
latter
had
not
made
the
girl
scout
troop
and
in
fact
she
had
been
left
out
of
almost
everything
lately
ruth
felt
sorry
for
her
and
hoped
by
this
invitation
to
make
up
for
neglecting
her
during
the
past
month
or
two
miss
martin
sent
over
the
request
that
the
girl
scouts
wear
their
uniforms
ruth
was
somewhat
annoyed
at
the
idea
who
wants
to
dress
up
in
a
hot
khaki
suit
this
time
of
year
she
complained
but
miss
phillips
had
issued
the
order
and
all
the
scouts
had
to
obey
ruth
doris
and
evelyn
got
permission
to
leave
the
rest
of
the
students
while
they
went
in
search
of
the
boys
they
met
them
at
the
gate
and
ruth
introduced
evelyn
ruth
had
tried
to
arrange
matters
so
that
jack
would
walk
with
evelyn
and
roger
with
doris
so
that
john
hadley
would
be
left
to
accompany
her
but
her
plans
went
wrong
john
immediately
attached
himself
to
doris
who
had
started
on
with
roger
so
evelyn
and
ruth
were
both
forced
to
walk
with
jack
when
the
party
reached
the
field
ruth
decided
to
take
matters
in
her
own
hands
mr
hadley
she
said
laughing
i
am
afraid
i
shall
have
to
scold
you
can
t
you
see
that
roger
and
doris
want
to
be
together
oh
i
beg
their
pardon
said
john
apologetically
i
really
nonsense
exclaimed
doris
please
don
t
be
silly
but
they
discovered
that
they
could
not
all
sit
together
and
ruth
saw
to
it
that
doris
and
roger
took
the
seats
ahead
and
she
and
evelyn
sat
between
jack
and
john
she
smiled
happily
at
last
she
was
with
all
the
girl
scouts
except
ruth
and
doris
and
those
taking
part
in
the
game
occupied
a
bench
together
in
their
neat
trim
uniforms
they
presented
an
attractive
appearance
john
remarked
about
it
and
ruth
saw
him
looking
closely
at
the
girls
is
marjorie
wilkinson
a
member
of
the
troop
now
he
asked
ruth
laughed
no
poor
girl
she
isn
t
it
s
a
shame
too
for
she
tries
so
hard
but
she
s
hopeless
in
latin
john
sighed
thinking
of
his
remaining
month
at
episcopal
i
ll
never
see
her
again
he
kept
thinking
to
himself
unless
i
suddenly
develop
a
violent
friendship
with
jack
the
referee
blew
the
whistle
and
the
contestants
appeared
the
forwards
grouped
themselves
around
the
baskets
and
practiced
throwing
for
goals
the
rest
of
the
girls
gathered
in
separate
spots
to
go
over
a
few
last
points
marjorie
realized
that
she
was
a
different
girl
from
the
one
who
had
played
forward
on
the
last
fall
she
came
to
this
game
with
miss
martin
s
in
perfect
physical
condition
and
with
the
consciousness
of
good
practices
behind
her
and
added
to
this
she
felt
a
new
love
for
miss
phillips
she
knew
how
much
her
teacher
cared
for
the
victory
and
she
meant
to
do
all
in
her
power
to
win
it
john
regarded
her
all
the
while
intently
he
scarcely
listened
to
the
conversation
ruth
and
evelyn
were
holding
with
jack
in
a
few
moments
the
game
started
marjorie
had
the
advantage
of
being
taller
than
the
opposing
center
besides
this
she
had
arranged
for
signals
with
frances
and
her
forwards
so
that
her
efforts
in
getting
the
ball
to
her
team
immediately
after
the
were
almost
always
successful
with
this
advantage
the
audience
thought
the
game
was
going
to
prove
to
be
a
for
miss
allen
s
team
but
such
was
not
the
case
the
guards
who
played
against
ethel
and
edith
were
splendid
they
succeeded
in
keeping
the
forwards
from
scoring
for
nearly
five
minutes
at
the
end
of
which
time
they
finally
sent
the
ball
to
the
other
end
of
the
field
but
if
the
guards
on
miss
martin
s
team
had
been
good
those
on
miss
allen
s
proved
equally
efficient
again
these
forwards
were
powerless
the
only
real
chance
that
was
given
to
miss
martin
s
side
to
score
was
when
dorothy
maxwell
made
a
foul
and
gave
the
forward
a
free
throw
but
the
girl
missed
the
basket
the
whistle
blew
and
the
score
remained
during
the
intermission
the
spectators
cheered
loudly
for
both
sides
and
the
gym
teachers
encouraged
and
coached
their
girls
each
team
went
back
to
the
field
with
the
grim
determination
to
win
the
forwards
put
even
more
energy
into
their
playing
but
the
guards
on
both
sides
opposed
them
the
more
zealously
during
the
first
ten
minutes
each
side
threw
a
successful
foul
so
that
the
score
now
stood
at
one
all
when
marjorie
realized
that
the
time
was
almost
up
she
grew
desperate
giving
frances
a
new
signal
which
she
had
agreed
to
use
only
in
case
of
the
greatest
necessity
she
made
a
quick
dodge
away
from
the
opposing
center
and
at
the
very
edge
of
the
line
made
a
wild
throw
at
the
goal
but
she
missed
it
and
stepped
slightly
over
the
line
the
referee
called
a
foul
and
miss
martin
s
girls
scored
a
point
on
the
ensuing
free
throw
the
home
team
was
ahead
a
wild
shout
arose
from
the
enthusiastic
spectators
but
marjorie
was
not
to
be
daunted
by
one
failure
her
forwards
had
proved
themselves
unable
to
dodge
their
guards
and
score
she
would
try
a
second
time
accordingly
she
gave
the
same
signal
to
frances
again
and
quick
as
a
flash
leapt
away
from
her
opponent
keeping
her
eye
on
the
line
that
she
might
not
overstep
it
she
made
another
flying
shot
the
ball
sped
high
over
the
heads
of
the
girls
who
rushed
to
defend
the
basket
for
an
instant
a
hush
came
over
the
field
as
all
eyes
watched
it
describe
a
graceful
arc
and
fall
straight
through
the
goal
a
perfect
shot
then
the
silence
was
broken
not
only
miss
allen
s
girls
everyone
on
the
benches
clapped
it
was
a
spectacular
play
and
it
brought
victory
in
less
than
a
minute
the
whistle
blew
and
the
registered
in
favor
of
miss
allen
s
team
ruth
breathed
a
long
sigh
and
john
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead
by
george
he
exclaimed
that
was
the
most
exciting
game
i
ever
saw
wasn
t
marjorie
wonderful
at
this
moment
a
yell
arose
for
marjorie
and
it
was
then
that
ruth
realized
her
mistake
in
having
john
hadley
asked
to
attend
the
game
but
it
was
too
late
now
to
regret
her
action
instead
she
discreetly
joined
in
the
other
girl
s
praises
her
party
followed
the
crowd
across
the
campus
to
the
gym
where
tea
was
being
served
john
looked
anxiously
for
marjorie
but
she
had
been
too
much
exhausted
to
appear
everyone
was
clamoring
for
her
the
heroine
of
the
day
and
they
say
she
isn
t
even
a
girl
scout
ruth
heard
one
of
miss
martin
s
girls
remark
to
her
companions
she
s
such
a
peach
too
i
wonder
why
ruth
frowned
yes
everybody
else
wonders
why
too
she
thought
oh
i
m
sick
of
hearing
the
praises
of
marjorie
wilkinson
but
i
m
even
with
her
ruth
was
relieved
to
hear
miss
martin
ask
the
girl
scouts
to
give
a
demonstration
she
stepped
forward
proudly
glad
of
the
chance
to
assume
again
the
center
of
attraction
but
ruth
was
not
happy
as
she
rode
home
that
evening
outwardly
her
plans
had
all
succeeded
but
she
was
not
at
peace
she
knew
that
she
was
as
much
of
a
thief
as
the
common
burglar
who
breaks
into
the
house
at
night
and
steals
the
silverware
she
had
stolen
marjorie
s
happiness
and
she
was
paying
for
her
act
she
had
lost
her
own
chapter
xxii
the
ghost
at
the
cabin
miss
phillips
had
promised
to
take
the
first
eight
girls
who
qualified
as
scouts
on
an
overnight
hike
she
had
decided
to
limit
the
number
for
two
reasons
first
because
the
ground
was
still
too
damp
to
risk
sleeping
out
of
doors
and
she
had
accepted
the
use
of
the
boys
cabin
and
second
because
she
wanted
to
reward
the
more
energetic
scouts
it
was
not
until
the
last
friday
in
may
that
the
required
number
finally
qualified
and
the
captain
read
the
names
and
announced
the
hike
for
the
first
week
end
in
june
which
was
only
two
weeks
before
school
closed
for
the
term
besides
ruth
doris
and
helen
who
had
all
passed
their
test
before
the
spring
holidays
dorothy
maxwell
lucy
graham
ethel
todd
edith
evans
and
ada
mearns
were
finally
added
to
the
number
miss
phillips
dismissed
the
other
scouts
and
dictated
a
list
of
articles
for
the
girls
to
take
with
them
then
she
divided
the
group
into
pairs
and
assigned
them
their
especial
duties
ruth
was
glad
to
be
coupled
with
doris
for
whom
she
possessed
a
great
admiration
will
we
be
allowed
to
go
in
swimming
asked
ruth
after
most
of
the
arrangements
had
been
concluded
if
it
is
warm
enough
replied
the
captain
there
is
a
creek
just
beyond
the
cabin
and
the
swimming
is
good
all
the
way
down
to
the
dam
where
episcopal
academy
is
located
you
know
so
you
can
take
your
suits
if
you
care
to
and
then
we
will
test
the
water
and
see
if
it
s
as
warm
as
it
has
been
this
week
i
don
t
see
any
reason
why
you
shouldn
t
unless
of
course
your
parents
would
object
to
your
going
in
on
do
you
suppose
asked
doris
a
little
timidly
that
we
will
see
the
ghost
the
boys
talk
about
miss
phillips
laughed
hardly
she
answered
i
thought
of
the
possibility
of
the
boys
playing
some
sort
of
trick
on
you
to
scare
you
so
i
mentioned
the
matter
to
remington
and
he
promptly
offered
to
take
the
whole
troop
over
to
visit
another
troop
of
scouts
who
have
the
use
of
a
barn
in
a
little
town
just
outside
of
new
no
captain
i
meant
a
ghost
of
course
i
don
t
believe
in
them
but
but
if
you
saw
anything
at
night
in
the
woods
interrupted
ethel
you
wouldn
t
just
care
about
being
alone
yes
admitted
doris
you
know
there
be
something
spooky
i
wish
something
would
happen
exclaimed
ruth
but
i
guess
captain
phillips
killed
any
chance
we
had
of
that
immediately
after
lunch
the
following
saturday
the
girls
met
with
their
packs
strapped
in
and
swung
over
their
shoulders
has
anybody
ever
camped
out
before
asked
miss
phillips
as
they
started
on
their
long
hike
about
eight
of
my
sunday
school
class
crowded
into
one
little
cottage
at
the
seashore
said
ethel
but
that
was
the
nearest
i
ever
came
to
of
course
this
won
t
exactly
be
camping
for
we
shall
not
use
tents
but
everything
else
will
be
the
same
said
the
captain
after
some
of
the
others
had
related
experiences
similar
to
ethel
s
instead
of
first
taking
a
train
and
then
hiking
the
rest
of
the
distance
the
girls
decided
to
hike
the
entire
way
if
they
had
been
obliged
to
construct
a
or
even
put
up
tents
to
sleep
under
miss
phillips
would
not
have
allowed
it
but
since
the
cabin
was
all
ready
for
them
and
there
was
even
a
fireplace
to
use
for
cooking
she
thought
that
by
this
time
they
should
be
able
to
do
it
and
although
they
were
somewhat
tired
when
they
finally
arrived
at
their
destination
no
one
considered
the
distance
too
far
after
each
girl
had
unfastened
her
pack
and
deposited
her
equipment
in
the
section
or
corner
to
which
she
was
assigned
dorothy
and
edith
began
to
get
supper
who
ll
go
for
water
asked
the
latter
holding
up
two
pails
the
girls
groaned
everybody
was
too
tired
but
in
a
moment
ruth
jumped
up
i
will
she
said
pleasantly
thanks
awfully
said
edith
gratefully
do
you
want
anybody
to
go
with
you
no
it
s
still
light
and
even
if
it
weren
t
i
wouldn
t
mind
meeting
doris
s
ghost
ruth
ran
out
lightly
humming
a
song
as
she
went
it
was
already
twilight
and
the
gradual
deepening
of
the
shadows
made
the
trees
seem
taller
and
the
absolute
stillness
increased
the
loneliness
of
the
spot
it
a
spooky
place
she
thought
as
she
looked
about
her
i
wonder
who
ll
come
down
to
the
spring
for
water
the
girls
who
in
accordance
with
scout
principles
had
refrained
from
eating
while
they
were
hiking
felt
that
they
were
almost
starved
nothing
ever
tasted
quite
so
good
as
the
meal
their
cooks
prepared
for
them
they
ate
hungrily
talking
little
at
first
gradually
as
their
appetites
were
appeased
and
their
bodies
became
rested
they
became
more
talkative
it
was
dark
when
they
had
finished
after
the
had
been
washed
and
put
away
and
the
food
stored
in
the
closet
the
girls
stepped
out
of
the
cabin
to
take
a
look
at
their
surroundings
but
unlike
the
night
of
the
boys
party
there
was
no
moon
and
the
trees
cut
off
so
much
of
the
sky
that
very
few
stars
were
in
view
everything
looked
black
and
forbidding
doris
shuddered
i
m
glad
i
m
not
here
alone
she
whispered
afraid
to
break
the
deep
silence
of
the
woods
those
boy
scouts
must
be
pretty
suddenly
a
screech
sounded
from
a
distant
tree
the
girls
started
fearfully
what
was
it
asked
doris
only
an
owl
replied
miss
phillips
laughing
they
turned
and
entered
the
cabin
feeling
that
the
light
of
the
lanterns
though
somewhat
dim
and
ghostlike
was
more
reassuring
than
the
darkness
somebody
will
have
to
go
for
more
water
remarked
edith
as
the
girls
were
sitting
around
the
fire
again
toasting
marshmallows
we
used
what
we
had
for
the
i
d
rather
go
without
a
drink
all
night
said
doris
than
go
down
to
that
spring
how
about
getting
washed
asked
ruth
i
d
rather
go
dirty
the
girls
discussed
the
proposition
for
several
minutes
until
miss
phillips
interrupted
them
by
saying
it
is
my
fault
girls
for
not
appointing
but
i
thought
that
since
the
spring
is
so
near
it
wouldn
t
be
necessary
so
i
ll
go
myself
indeed
you
won
t
declared
ruth
i
m
not
afraid
a
bit
i
ll
i
don
t
think
you
ought
to
go
again
ruth
said
edith
it
doesn
t
seem
fair
but
so
long
as
you
have
offered
i
ll
go
with
you
only
i
won
t
pretend
i
m
not
afraid
i
am
then
i
ll
go
alone
i
dare
you
to
said
ethel
all
right
i
ll
take
you
up
i
ll
go
down
with
two
pails
and
when
i
get
back
you
do
the
same
what
is
that
queer
noise
asked
dorothy
suddenly
listen
the
girls
sat
perfectly
silent
and
a
low
singing
and
sighing
which
at
times
sank
almost
to
a
moan
could
be
heard
in
the
woods
close
by
could
it
be
two
boughs
rubbing
each
other
asked
ruth
i
read
about
that
happening
once
and
scaring
some
boys
out
of
their
no
replied
miss
phillips
there
would
have
to
be
wind
for
that
and
it
s
perfectly
still
it
sounds
to
me
like
some
animal
in
a
animal
asked
doris
fearfully
oh
let
s
bolt
the
door
captain
no
no
probably
a
cat
or
a
dog
whining
let
s
forget
all
about
it
suppose
we
sing
a
the
girls
did
try
to
put
aside
all
their
fears
but
ruth
and
ethel
although
they
would
not
admit
it
dreaded
for
the
time
to
come
when
the
party
should
break
up
but
the
moment
came
all
too
soon
nine
o
clock
announced
miss
phillips
rising
from
her
pillow
on
the
floor
time
for
taps
the
girls
got
up
reluctantly
and
edith
brought
ruth
her
pails
the
latter
laughed
gaily
and
now
for
the
great
adventure
she
said
as
she
opened
the
cabin
door
and
stepped
out
into
the
darkness
she
took
half
a
dozen
steps
when
she
suddenly
heard
that
weird
sound
from
the
direction
toward
which
she
was
approaching
she
stopped
breathless
and
looked
all
around
her
but
seeing
nothing
she
walked
on
trying
bravely
to
whistle
just
as
she
was
out
of
sight
of
the
cabin
she
saw
a
tall
figure
glide
from
one
tree
to
another
and
in
an
instant
she
heard
the
sound
again
her
heart
stood
still
no
mortal
being
had
ever
produced
a
sound
like
that
the
boys
were
right
the
spot
haunted
ruth
felt
that
although
she
could
now
plainly
see
the
spring
she
could
not
go
a
step
farther
she
looked
around
again
the
figure
had
vanished
and
except
for
the
occasional
hoot
of
an
owl
or
the
croak
of
a
frog
absolute
silence
prevailed
it
must
have
been
my
imagination
she
thought
she
was
naturally
a
brave
girl
and
added
to
this
fact
she
longed
for
the
admiration
of
her
companions
so
she
forced
herself
to
press
on
and
fill
her
buckets
at
the
spring
but
she
had
hardly
taken
another
step
before
she
heard
the
weird
sound
and
saw
the
figure
again
this
time
she
saw
it
distinctly
it
was
perfectly
white
even
its
face
had
the
deathly
pallor
of
the
ghost
it
did
not
seem
to
possess
eyes
only
hollow
sockets
and
by
this
ruth
was
convinced
that
it
was
no
earthly
being
by
this
time
the
girl
was
thoroughly
frightened
she
cared
no
longer
for
her
water
or
the
approval
of
the
other
girls
she
thought
only
of
her
safe
return
to
the
cabin
seeing
the
figure
approach
noiselessly
in
her
direction
she
dropped
her
pails
and
ran
as
fast
as
she
could
to
the
cabin
she
reached
the
door
and
flung
it
open
the
girls
started
forward
in
alarm
what
is
it
ruth
asked
doris
trembling
as
soon
as
ruth
could
get
her
breath
she
described
her
adventure
suddenly
she
stopped
listen
there
the
sounds
became
fainter
and
fainter
and
finally
died
in
the
distance
miss
phillips
would
not
permit
ethel
to
go
to
the
spring
by
herself
she
and
dorothy
both
accompanied
her
but
when
they
got
back
doris
and
edith
testified
that
through
the
one
window
of
the
cabin
they
had
seen
the
figure
flit
by
the
only
thing
we
can
do
said
ruth
the
last
thing
before
she
fell
asleep
is
to
compare
notes
with
the
boys
who
have
seen
the
ghost
or
whatever
it
is
she
added
chapter
xxiii
ruth
s
adventure
when
the
sun
poured
into
the
cabin
the
following
morning
and
ruth
was
awakened
by
the
happy
laughter
of
her
companions
the
incident
of
the
night
before
seemed
like
a
dream
if
she
had
been
a
nervous
or
timid
girl
the
others
would
have
had
occasion
to
attribute
her
story
to
an
imagination
but
ruth
was
the
last
girl
in
the
world
to
be
frightened
without
a
cause
besides
doris
and
edith
had
testified
to
the
presence
of
the
ghost
and
everybody
even
miss
phillips
had
heard
the
unearthly
sound
the
girls
breakfasted
out
of
doors
the
day
was
lovely
and
warm
and
they
all
felt
rested
and
happy
after
everything
has
been
put
in
order
said
miss
phillips
as
she
finished
her
coffee
we
are
going
to
have
a
simple
little
service
over
in
that
spot
under
the
trees
then
after
that
all
of
you
who
want
to
can
go
in
the
girls
prepared
to
go
about
their
duties
how
shall
we
know
when
it
is
time
for
service
asked
ethel
i
do
so
wish
we
had
a
bugler
to
blow
and
all
the
other
calls
for
that
matter
too
said
miss
phillips
but
maybe
pansy
troop
will
have
one
by
next
year
in
the
meanwhile
i
ll
have
to
use
the
whistle
signals
so
listen
for
a
succession
of
short
the
religious
service
held
on
that
sunday
in
june
by
the
little
band
of
girl
scouts
in
the
silence
of
the
woods
was
simple
in
form
but
probably
many
a
more
pretentious
one
in
sincerity
and
earnestness
miss
phillips
with
her
clear
voice
led
in
the
singing
of
several
familiar
hymns
and
the
girls
recited
the
first
psalm
together
with
the
exception
of
the
lord
s
prayer
the
prayers
were
silent
ones
but
the
girls
felt
deeply
moved
and
after
it
was
all
over
several
of
them
told
the
captain
that
it
was
the
most
impressive
service
they
had
ever
attended
everybody
except
the
captain
and
ethel
and
ada
who
were
cooks
decided
to
go
swimming
it
was
almost
noon
when
they
gathered
in
front
of
the
cabin
dressed
in
their
swimming
suits
covered
by
sweaters
or
raincoats
it
s
rather
late
said
miss
phillips
don
t
go
too
what
time
is
dinner
asked
doris
one
replied
ethel
and
if
anybody
is
more
than
five
minutes
late
she
doesn
t
get
any
the
girls
ran
off
in
high
spirits
ruth
was
the
first
to
plunge
into
the
creek
it
cold
she
admitted
to
doris
who
was
sitting
on
the
bank
dipping
one
toe
in
at
a
time
ruth
began
to
swim
rapidly
in
order
to
get
warm
i
m
going
around
the
bend
she
called
as
she
disappeared
from
view
the
other
girls
turned
their
attention
to
getting
wet
all
over
and
dismissed
ruth
from
their
minds
she
was
undoubtedly
the
best
swimmer
of
the
party
so
even
when
she
failed
to
appear
after
many
minutes
had
passed
no
one
expressed
concern
after
ruth
had
passed
the
bend
and
felt
thoroughly
warmed
by
the
exercise
she
decided
to
swim
farther
it
would
be
such
fun
to
go
all
the
way
to
the
dam
of
course
there
was
no
chance
of
seeing
john
hadley
or
any
other
of
the
scouts
since
remington
had
taken
them
all
on
the
excursion
but
she
would
have
the
satisfaction
of
telling
them
later
of
her
feat
she
began
to
wonder
how
far
the
dam
was
she
did
not
feel
in
the
least
tired
for
she
was
swimming
downstream
it
would
be
an
easy
matter
to
run
along
the
shore
back
to
the
cabin
and
if
she
should
be
late
for
dinner
ethel
s
admiration
for
her
act
would
surely
cause
her
to
pardon
the
delay
as
she
neared
the
dam
she
distinguished
two
figures
walking
side
by
side
and
she
wondered
whether
they
would
see
her
she
dipped
her
head
into
the
water
using
the
crawl
stroke
which
was
the
most
spectacular
one
she
knew
when
she
brought
her
head
out
a
second
time
one
of
the
figures
had
vanished
the
other
person
was
alone
it
was
a
girl
yes
and
she
was
watching
her
the
persons
that
ruth
saw
but
did
not
recognize
because
of
the
distance
were
jack
and
marjorie
wilkinson
jack
had
not
gone
on
the
boy
scout
outing
for
his
father
and
mother
who
were
visiting
relatives
living
not
far
from
the
academy
telegraphed
to
him
on
friday
that
they
would
get
marjorie
and
drive
over
to
his
school
to
spend
sunday
with
him
so
he
had
obtained
permission
to
remain
there
for
the
instead
of
accompanying
the
rest
of
the
scouts
marjorie
was
delighted
at
the
prospect
of
the
visit
she
had
been
looking
forward
to
a
dull
sunday
lily
had
gone
home
with
lucy
graham
and
most
of
her
other
friends
were
at
the
cabin
she
was
glad
to
see
her
parents
again
and
the
day
was
so
lovely
that
she
enjoyed
every
minute
of
the
ride
when
they
arrived
at
the
academy
wilkinson
announced
his
intention
of
looking
up
one
of
the
teachers
who
was
an
old
friend
of
the
family
you
can
do
whatever
you
like
for
an
hour
he
said
to
jack
and
marjorie
either
come
with
your
mother
and
me
or
go
off
by
jack
looked
at
marjorie
doubtfully
as
if
he
had
no
desire
to
spend
a
whole
hour
cooped
up
with
his
english
teacher
when
it
was
not
necessary
so
he
suggested
an
alternative
to
his
sister
how
would
you
like
to
see
our
he
asked
fine
answered
marjorie
it
s
too
nice
a
day
to
be
inside
besides
i
m
tired
of
sitting
they
took
the
path
back
of
the
school
which
led
down
to
the
creek
and
in
less
than
five
minutes
they
reached
the
dam
it
was
on
the
upper
side
of
the
dam
that
the
stream
was
widest
both
banks
sweeping
out
and
almost
meeting
again
at
the
waterfall
in
a
horseshoe
curve
which
gave
it
the
appearance
of
a
lake
trees
grew
to
the
water
s
edge
their
branches
mirrored
with
a
gentle
shimmering
reflection
in
the
quiet
water
along
the
shore
farther
out
toward
the
middle
the
current
was
swift
it
seemed
to
gather
force
as
it
rushed
foaming
over
the
dam
to
the
rocks
below
marjorie
went
into
ecstacies
impressed
by
the
beauty
of
the
spot
i
wish
i
could
paint
it
she
said
wouldn
t
it
be
lovely
i
tell
you
what
i
will
do
said
her
brother
after
he
had
thought
for
a
minute
or
two
i
ll
take
a
picture
of
it
what
with
my
camera
s
up
in
my
room
and
i
ve
got
two
exposures
left
on
the
film
if
you
ll
wait
here
i
ll
run
back
and
get
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
marjorie
sat
down
on
a
stone
and
gazed
idly
into
the
water
she
watched
the
gliding
over
the
smooth
surface
and
wondered
how
deep
it
was
at
this
spot
and
whether
it
was
still
cold
jack
had
told
her
that
the
boys
had
already
gone
swimming
here
but
then
boys
would
try
anything
for
a
minute
she
watched
the
water
falling
over
the
dam
and
noted
the
swiftness
of
the
current
she
turned
her
head
in
the
other
direction
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
swimmer
rapidly
approaching
her
as
the
latter
came
nearer
marjorie
identified
her
as
a
girl
by
the
blue
rubber
cap
she
wore
on
her
head
when
she
was
only
a
dozen
yards
away
but
still
unrecognizable
from
the
fact
that
her
face
was
usually
under
the
water
marjorie
saw
her
suddenly
raise
an
arm
and
wave
in
her
direction
choke
and
finally
go
under
she
came
up
and
went
down
a
second
time
before
marjorie
saw
that
it
was
ruth
and
realized
that
she
must
have
been
seized
with
a
cramp
and
was
unable
to
resist
the
force
of
the
current
the
frightened
girl
cast
a
wild
glance
back
toward
the
school
jack
oh
jack
she
shrieked
as
loud
as
she
could
but
she
got
no
answer
in
a
panic
she
turned
again
toward
the
water
ruth
had
come
up
again
but
marjorie
could
see
by
her
face
that
she
was
unconscious
already
the
current
had
carried
her
several
yards
further
down
towards
the
dam
there
was
not
a
moment
to
be
lost
if
ruth
went
down
the
third
time
it
would
be
too
late
kicking
off
her
pumps
she
plunged
into
the
water
and
struck
out
for
her
friend
although
marjorie
had
been
swimming
in
the
pool
almost
every
day
for
the
past
three
months
the
water
gave
her
a
shock
it
was
still
much
colder
than
that
to
which
she
had
been
accustomed
and
the
weight
of
her
clothes
dragged
her
down
nevertheless
with
only
a
few
bold
strokes
she
reached
the
unconscious
girl
breathing
a
sigh
of
thankfulness
for
miss
phillips
s
efficient
instruction
in
she
took
hold
of
ruth
and
made
for
the
shore
her
burden
seemed
heavy
but
she
did
not
have
far
to
go
in
another
minute
she
reached
the
shallow
water
and
carried
ruth
to
the
shore
but
her
battle
was
only
half
over
she
had
only
a
vague
idea
of
what
to
do
to
revive
her
she
had
heard
lily
talk
about
learning
the
measures
of
resuscitation
at
one
of
the
scout
meetings
but
she
had
not
gone
into
detail
oh
if
i
were
only
a
girl
scout
she
groaned
i
d
know
what
to
do
she
began
to
work
ruth
s
arms
back
and
forth
in
an
aimless
fashion
which
did
not
produce
results
she
looked
around
desperately
for
her
brother
and
to
her
great
relief
saw
him
coming
along
the
path
jack
jack
hurry
she
screamed
wildly
help
jack
ran
as
fast
as
he
could
and
in
a
moment
stood
beside
her
he
did
not
ask
for
an
explanation
but
knelt
over
the
prostrate
girl
and
set
to
work
at
once
hold
her
tongue
out
he
commanded
to
keep
her
from
choking
while
i
get
the
water
out
of
her
now
then
young
lady
he
said
addressing
the
unconscious
girl
we
ll
fix
you
up
in
no
he
worked
tirelessly
for
ten
minutes
before
he
was
rewarded
by
seeing
ruth
open
her
eyes
consciousness
slowly
returned
but
it
was
several
minutes
before
she
realized
where
she
was
ruth
said
marjorie
tremulously
are
you
all
right
ruth
blinked
two
or
three
times
and
looked
from
one
to
the
other
of
her
companions
speak
ruth
urged
marjorie
marj
said
ruth
with
a
puzzled
air
yes
i
m
all
right
but
do
you
think
you
can
sit
up
ruth
asked
jack
then
we
ll
carry
you
up
to
the
yes
i
guess
so
she
answered
but
what
has
happened
jack
and
marjorie
made
a
seat
with
their
hands
and
raised
her
from
the
ground
marjorie
explained
what
had
just
taken
place
ruth
s
eyes
suddenly
lighted
up
i
remember
she
said
oh
maybe
i
wasn
t
scared
i
guess
i
got
a
cramp
in
my
leg
i
surely
thought
i
was
going
to
die
it
must
have
been
awful
said
marjorie
with
feeling
i
was
scared
to
death
they
carried
her
to
the
matron
of
the
infirmary
who
promised
to
get
her
dry
clothes
and
give
her
something
hot
to
drink
jack
volunteered
to
get
the
machine
and
take
the
news
to
the
cabin
while
marjorie
went
in
search
of
her
parents
while
ruth
was
dressing
she
reviewed
the
whole
situation
in
her
mind
the
experience
had
been
ghastly
if
dying
was
like
that
she
shuddered
at
the
prospect
and
yet
she
realized
that
one
thing
only
had
made
it
terrible
in
that
short
space
of
time
when
she
had
seemed
on
the
verge
of
eternity
she
thought
only
of
her
dishonest
act
toward
marjorie
everything
else
faded
from
her
consciousness
that
alone
assumed
gigantic
proportions
it
seemed
black
and
terrifying
even
at
this
moment
when
safety
was
assured
she
almost
cried
out
at
the
terror
of
her
memory
i
will
confess
it
all
she
exclaimed
before
i
am
a
day
older
in
a
few
moments
marjorie
joined
her
and
invited
her
to
go
with
the
family
to
the
hotel
for
dinner
i
will
if
you
promise
i
can
have
a
few
minutes
alone
with
you
afterwards
marjorie
she
said
i
ve
got
something
i
must
confess
marjorie
smiled
thinking
of
the
crocheting
all
right
ruth
if
you
like
but
come
when
they
were
all
seated
in
the
machine
ruth
thanked
both
of
her
rescuers
profusely
it
certainly
was
brave
of
you
she
said
brave
of
marj
but
not
me
protested
jack
i
was
scared
to
death
for
fear
something
would
happen
to
you
after
i
played
that
awful
trick
on
you
last
night
what
trick
the
ghost
at
the
cabin
oh
gasped
ruth
in
a
tone
that
expressed
volumes
so
it
was
you
jack
explained
why
he
had
remained
home
from
the
excursion
and
i
was
sort
of
lonely
last
night
all
the
other
scouts
were
away
you
know
so
i
decided
to
give
you
girls
a
scare
and
i
did
especially
want
to
get
because
i
knew
you
never
were
nervous
and
it
wouldn
t
upset
you
like
it
would
some
i
was
scared
all
right
but
how
did
you
ever
make
that
awful
noise
i
suppose
a
sheet
was
fixed
up
for
the
disguise
yes
and
the
noise
was
a
violin
i
heard
bill
mackintosh
practicing
on
his
new
violin
on
saturday
night
making
the
most
unearthly
sounds
you
ever
heard
that
put
the
idea
into
my
head
i
went
over
and
asked
him
to
go
out
with
me
to
give
the
girl
scouts
a
scare
of
course
he
was
tickled
to
death
to
go
we
slipped
away
right
after
supper
and
watched
you
through
the
maybe
i
wasn
t
glad
when
i
saw
you
were
the
one
to
go
after
the
water
you
horrid
mean
thing
said
ruth
i
admit
it
punish
me
any
way
you
like
but
ruth
could
not
think
of
any
return
for
his
act
during
the
rest
of
the
ride
and
all
through
dinner
her
mind
was
on
her
own
affairs
absently
she
answered
the
questions
that
were
put
to
her
and
entered
but
occasionally
into
the
conversation
the
rest
of
the
party
attributed
her
mood
to
the
experience
through
which
she
had
just
passed
and
left
her
alone
with
her
thoughts
they
rode
all
afternoon
so
that
she
had
no
opportunity
to
be
alone
with
marjorie
but
when
the
latter
said
that
lily
would
be
away
until
the
next
morning
she
asked
to
be
allowed
to
visit
her
right
after
supper
i
have
something
i
must
tell
you
before
i
go
to
bed
she
added
all
right
said
marjorie
but
i
wish
you
would
forget
it
i
wish
i
could
said
ruth
as
she
left
marjorie
to
go
to
her
room
chapter
xxiv
restitution
when
ruth
reached
her
own
room
she
found
ethel
already
there
untying
her
pack
and
putting
away
her
scout
equipment
ruth
explained
that
she
had
been
with
the
wilkinsons
that
they
had
brought
her
and
marjorie
both
back
to
the
school
now
tell
me
all
about
the
accident
said
ethel
of
course
we
got
the
story
from
jack
but
he
wasn
t
there
the
whole
time
so
he
couldn
t
tell
us
ruth
went
into
detail
about
the
adventure
but
she
omitted
to
describe
her
own
feelings
when
she
thought
she
was
drowning
that
was
too
personal
and
too
humiliating
it
was
bad
enough
to
have
to
tell
marjorie
but
she
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
a
public
acknowledgment
and
then
for
the
first
time
she
realized
something
of
what
the
consequences
of
her
confession
would
be
it
would
be
only
fair
to
allow
marjorie
to
tell
miss
white
miss
allen
and
miss
phillips
so
that
she
might
be
given
another
opportunity
to
join
the
troop
this
would
necessitate
an
explanation
to
the
other
scouts
and
they
in
turn
would
undoubtedly
tell
all
the
girls
in
the
school
a
confession
would
doom
her
to
the
lasting
contempt
of
her
companions
and
her
teachers
she
would
probably
be
put
out
of
the
troop
and
be
shunned
by
her
former
friends
even
now
it
was
not
too
late
to
change
her
mind
no
one
was
suspicious
it
was
true
that
she
had
hinted
of
a
confession
to
marjorie
but
she
could
tell
her
about
the
crochet
and
she
would
probably
laugh
and
forgive
her
while
these
thoughts
were
going
through
her
mind
ethel
was
talking
about
the
ghost
incident
and
laughing
at
jack
s
cleverness
it
was
funny
she
said
to
think
that
he
put
one
over
on
you
ruth
for
you
re
not
easily
scared
but
you
were
scared
when
you
thought
you
were
drowning
was
i
exclaimed
ruth
dying
is
a
good
deal
worse
than
i
ever
thought
it
would
be
maybe
you
had
a
guilty
conscience
suggested
ethel
i
guess
most
people
have
answered
ruth
unless
they
re
nuns
or
ministers
or
something
like
maybe
they
have
too
said
ethel
as
she
left
the
room
the
conversation
brought
ruth
back
to
her
dilemma
it
recalled
to
her
again
vividly
that
dreadful
sensation
of
terror
that
had
overwhelmed
her
in
the
water
ethel
had
said
she
was
never
afraid
of
anything
she
smiled
bitterly
probably
no
girl
in
the
school
had
ever
been
so
frightened
so
terrified
to
the
very
depths
of
her
soul
as
she
had
been
but
she
would
not
risk
a
second
experience
she
dreaded
the
consequences
of
her
confession
but
she
dreaded
to
a
much
greater
degree
the
consequences
of
the
omission
of
that
confession
she
had
made
up
her
mind
she
would
not
change
it
she
would
tell
marjorie
that
night
as
they
were
dressing
for
dinner
she
announced
to
ethel
her
intention
of
spending
the
night
with
marjorie
i
ll
get
miss
allen
s
permission
she
added
ethel
looked
at
ruth
suspiciously
there
must
be
some
reason
she
thought
for
this
sudden
desire
for
marjorie
s
but
her
suppositions
were
far
from
the
truth
she
attributed
the
attraction
to
the
other
girl
s
brother
after
supper
ruth
gathered
her
books
and
her
toilet
articles
and
started
for
marjorie
s
room
she
found
two
or
three
other
girls
visiting
her
friend
and
for
some
time
had
no
chance
to
talk
with
her
alone
finally
they
all
left
ruth
opened
her
book
but
she
could
not
study
you
know
i
said
i
had
something
to
tell
you
marj
she
said
slowly
with
her
eyes
fastened
to
the
pattern
of
the
rug
it
s
a
confession
marjorie
drew
down
the
corners
of
her
mouth
in
her
effort
to
keep
from
smiling
the
incident
of
the
crochet
had
seemed
big
at
the
time
but
now
it
appeared
as
only
a
trifle
maybe
i
know
already
she
suggested
about
your
filet
you
mean
yes
miss
phillips
gave
it
away
at
that
surprise
i
thought
so
she
never
guessed
of
course
but
i
knew
you
d
put
two
and
two
together
well
i
don
t
mind
ruth
i
was
mad
at
the
time
but
after
all
it
didn
t
hurt
me
and
you
d
have
been
a
scout
soon
perhaps
said
ruth
you
ve
been
too
good
to
me
marj
but
wait
till
you
hear
the
rest
the
rest
yes
that
isn
t
nearly
all
i
m
a
real
criminal
oh
marj
if
you
hadn
t
saved
me
and
i
d
died
what
would
have
become
of
me
ruth
suddenly
burst
into
tears
she
had
been
under
too
great
a
strain
in
the
last
hours
and
she
lost
control
of
herself
completely
after
all
she
was
only
fifteen
and
the
rôle
of
criminal
was
new
to
her
aside
from
the
little
white
lies
that
most
of
us
tell
sometimes
she
had
up
to
this
time
been
upright
in
character
marjorie
jumped
up
and
put
her
arms
around
her
she
forgot
about
the
ruth
she
had
known
during
the
past
year
she
saw
only
her
old
playmate
as
she
used
to
cry
when
she
was
hurt
what
is
it
ruth
she
asked
with
concern
is
there
anything
i
can
do
to
help
you
but
ruth
pushed
her
aside
and
wiped
her
eyes
sit
down
marj
she
said
as
calmly
as
she
could
i
don
t
deserve
your
sympathy
listen
marjorie
sat
opposite
her
and
ruth
told
her
story
she
told
it
exactly
as
it
had
happened
omitting
none
of
the
details
and
making
no
effort
to
excuse
her
motive
she
called
herself
names
she
was
a
traitor
a
thief
and
a
liar
she
deserved
no
mercy
she
wanted
none
marjorie
could
do
whatever
she
wanted
with
her
but
now
she
could
die
with
a
clear
conscience
marjorie
listened
in
amazement
the
story
seemed
too
dreadful
to
be
true
and
yet
the
facts
linked
together
and
explained
all
her
former
doubts
suddenly
the
realization
of
what
she
had
missed
came
over
her
the
party
at
the
cabin
the
overnight
hike
the
play
rehearsals
and
all
the
good
times
the
fellowship
with
miss
phillips
and
doris
and
the
rest
of
her
friends
and
the
opportunity
to
be
with
john
hadley
four
months
of
happiness
that
she
had
lost
she
had
been
cheated
out
of
her
rights
she
felt
bitter
she
could
not
forgive
ruth
she
turned
to
her
sharply
but
before
she
could
utter
a
word
a
knock
sounded
at
the
door
it
was
miss
phillips
come
in
said
marjorie
as
naturally
as
she
could
ruth
stood
up
as
the
teacher
entered
but
she
could
not
bear
to
salute
i
just
wanted
to
see
whether
lily
is
back
yet
said
miss
phillips
i
am
sorry
but
she
isn
t
miss
phillips
but
won
t
you
sit
down
only
for
a
minute
i
wanted
to
tell
lily
and
i
ll
take
this
chance
to
tell
you
ruth
that
the
scouts
decided
to
give
up
next
saturday
to
doing
a
good
turn
for
somebody
else
so
i
have
miss
allen
s
permission
to
invite
the
little
orphans
from
the
mynfield
home
for
an
how
lovely
said
marjorie
absently
poor
children
they
don
t
have
much
pleasure
in
their
lives
continued
miss
phillips
not
noticing
the
girls
preoccupation
so
when
frances
suggested
giving
them
a
party
next
saturday
i
jumped
at
the
idea
it
s
our
last
saturday
together
except
for
the
one
of
the
play
but
the
girls
want
to
use
it
for
their
troop
good
miss
phillips
stayed
for
a
few
minutes
and
told
the
girls
more
about
the
little
orphans
and
when
she
rose
to
go
they
had
almost
forgotten
for
the
time
their
own
tragedy
neither
girl
said
anything
for
several
minutes
after
miss
phillips
had
gone
marjorie
sat
down
at
her
desk
and
started
to
write
ruth
turned
the
pages
of
her
book
but
she
did
not
look
at
the
contents
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
marj
she
asked
nothing
replied
marjorie
indifferently
ruth
s
hopes
rose
but
she
shook
her
head
i
can
t
allow
that
she
said
you
ought
to
be
a
girl
but
most
of
the
good
times
are
over
not
this
summer
s
camping
trip
and
if
we
tell
miss
phillips
the
reason
she
ll
probably
let
you
take
the
test
with
the
others
next
friday
marjorie
s
face
brightened
it
was
the
dream
of
her
heart
to
become
a
girl
scout
but
then
she
thought
of
the
disgrace
this
would
necessitate
bringing
upon
ruth
miss
white
and
miss
phillips
would
both
have
to
know
the
story
and
perhaps
even
miss
allen
and
some
of
the
scouts
ruth
had
not
treated
her
as
a
scout
should
treat
anyone
let
alone
a
former
friend
but
that
would
not
excuse
marjorie
if
she
disregarded
the
other
girl
s
feelings
she
thought
of
the
scout
slogan
that
miss
phillips
had
just
been
speaking
about
do
a
good
turn
and
if
i
start
my
career
as
a
girl
scout
by
disregarding
that
law
it
would
be
to
begin
all
wrong
better
stay
out
of
the
troop
forever
she
reflected
i
m
not
going
to
do
a
thing
ruth
she
said
aloud
it
would
be
too
hard
on
you
ruth
jumped
up
with
characteristic
impulsiveness
i
m
going
straight
to
miss
white
this
very
minute
she
said
and
lay
the
whole
thing
before
her
then
i
ll
do
whatever
she
before
she
could
protest
ruth
was
gone
marjorie
turned
to
her
writing
but
she
could
think
of
nothing
but
the
present
complication
she
felt
sorry
for
ruth
but
she
could
not
help
hoping
that
miss
white
would
insist
upon
a
confession
she
pictured
herself
in
the
girl
scout
uniform
marching
along
with
the
other
girls
helping
them
with
the
play
and
accompanying
them
on
their
camping
trip
she
thought
of
the
pleasure
of
telling
her
father
and
mother
and
jack
yes
and
john
hadley
of
her
final
triumph
miss
phillips
too
would
be
genuinely
glad
of
her
good
fortune
she
waited
impatiently
for
ruth
to
return
she
got
up
and
straightened
the
room
took
out
some
crocheting
put
it
down
and
finally
sat
down
on
the
couch
to
dream
of
the
fulfillment
of
her
cherished
hope
in
about
fifteen
minutes
ruth
came
back
accompanied
by
miss
white
the
older
woman
looked
sad
as
she
took
marjorie
s
hand
and
spoke
softly
i
am
so
sorry
my
dear
that
this
had
to
happen
that
ruth
was
tempted
and
fell
and
you
had
to
suffer
but
she
has
done
right
to
oh
miss
white
i
didn
t
want
her
to
tell
any
body
yes
i
know
she
told
me
how
noble
you
have
been
about
it
but
you
have
some
rights
marjorie
i
shall
tell
miss
allen
that
there
has
been
a
mistake
and
ask
her
permission
to
give
you
a
special
tell
her
the
truth
exclaimed
ruth
it
isn
t
fair
for
you
to
take
the
blame
miss
i
will
tell
her
if
she
asks
marjorie
can
you
come
to
my
room
at
three
afternoon
certainly
replied
marjorie
miss
white
opened
the
door
leave
the
matter
in
my
hands
girls
and
don
t
worry
about
it
any
after
she
had
gone
the
girls
went
to
bed
but
said
nothing
more
about
the
thing
that
was
uppermost
in
their
thoughts
it
was
miss
allen
and
her
attitude
toward
the
matter
that
caused
the
most
conjecture
in
the
minds
of
both
girls
as
they
laid
their
heads
upon
their
pillows
that
night
chapter
xxv
the
verdict
and
what
makes
you
think
you
made
a
mistake
in
marjorie
wilkinson
s
paper
asked
miss
allen
after
miss
white
had
requested
for
permission
to
give
the
girl
a
second
test
you
aren
t
in
the
habit
of
doing
your
work
well
mother
was
ill
you
know
and
marjorie
s
subsequent
work
has
been
so
good
that
i
felt
there
must
be
some
miss
allen
shut
her
lips
tightly
i
am
sorry
to
refuse
to
grant
your
request
miss
white
she
said
but
if
i
allowed
a
second
test
for
no
more
reason
than
you
suggest
it
would
establish
a
precedent
every
girl
who
fails
in
any
examination
will
demand
another
opportunity
the
final
examinations
are
less
than
two
weeks
off
marjorie
will
have
the
chance
to
show
her
ability
in
i
see
your
point
of
view
miss
allen
said
miss
white
i
had
hoped
you
would
grant
my
request
without
further
explanation
but
as
you
say
it
would
not
be
right
for
such
an
insignificant
reason
so
i
will
tell
you
the
whole
she
repeated
to
the
principal
the
facts
of
ruth
s
confession
she
told
how
cleverly
the
girl
had
spoiled
the
paper
she
recalled
the
fact
that
the
papers
had
been
marked
at
home
destroyed
and
the
averages
mailed
to
the
school
everything
indeed
had
seemed
to
play
into
ruth
s
hands
in
order
to
help
her
to
escape
detection
miss
allen
listened
with
increasing
anger
as
the
narrative
progressed
the
whole
thing
was
inconceivable
a
disgrace
to
her
school
ruth
henry
must
be
expelled
at
once
she
declared
emphatically
no
no
pleaded
miss
white
remember
that
she
confessed
it
herself
if
someone
had
told
on
her
it
would
be
different
suppose
we
send
for
her
and
for
miss
phillips
too
since
it
is
a
matter
which
so
intimately
concerns
the
ruth
and
her
captain
entered
the
office
together
in
a
few
words
miss
allen
reviewed
the
situation
to
miss
phillips
while
ruth
sat
motionless
with
downcast
eyes
i
am
of
the
opinion
said
miss
allen
coldly
that
a
girl
who
would
do
such
a
contemptible
trick
as
that
should
be
expelled
from
the
ruth
started
that
was
one
calamity
she
had
not
thought
of
then
her
mother
and
father
would
know
yes
and
all
the
people
at
home
but
miss
white
and
miss
phillips
both
pleaded
in
her
behalf
she
had
done
wrong
they
said
but
it
was
her
first
offense
and
she
had
confessed
such
a
punishment
would
be
too
severe
then
at
least
she
must
be
put
out
of
the
troop
she
has
not
acted
like
a
girl
scout
she
should
not
be
permitted
to
wear
the
ruth
rose
white
to
the
lips
i
am
ready
to
resign
captain
phillips
she
said
unsteadily
i
did
not
expect
to
be
allowed
to
miss
phillips
put
her
hand
on
the
girl
s
shoulder
wait
ruth
she
said
quietly
we
must
think
everything
over
then
turning
to
miss
allen
she
said
it
isn
t
fair
to
torture
ruth
in
this
fashion
suppose
we
let
her
go
out
and
talk
the
matter
over
and
then
give
her
our
tears
came
to
ruth
s
eyes
but
she
looked
gratefully
at
miss
phillips
oh
thank
you
she
stammered
i
ll
do
whatever
you
you
may
go
ruth
said
miss
allen
the
teachers
talked
for
a
long
time
over
the
affair
but
finally
miss
phillips
triumphed
ruth
s
case
was
to
be
put
up
to
the
girl
scouts
while
she
remained
away
from
the
meeting
they
were
to
decide
whether
or
not
she
was
to
stay
in
the
troop
and
each
scout
was
to
pledge
on
her
honor
as
a
girl
scout
never
to
mention
the
matter
outside
that
afternoon
marjorie
took
her
latin
test
and
passed
with
flying
colors
as
soon
as
she
learned
of
her
success
she
went
straight
to
miss
phillips
i
will
give
you
the
tenderfoot
test
if
you
wish
said
the
captain
then
if
you
are
prepared
i
will
waive
the
usual
custom
and
you
may
take
the
test
on
friday
with
the
eight
girls
who
have
not
yet
passed
lily
was
wild
over
the
good
news
of
course
marjorie
said
nothing
about
the
cause
of
her
incorrect
mark
she
simply
stated
that
miss
white
had
given
her
a
second
chance
and
that
miss
phillips
had
arranged
a
special
scout
test
and
i
am
to
be
taken
in
on
friday
she
said
hugging
her
joyfully
think
of
it
lil
a
girl
scout
at
last
every
girl
in
the
troop
was
genuinely
glad
to
welcome
marjorie
into
their
ranks
she
had
waited
so
long
for
her
happiness
she
trembled
now
lest
something
should
happen
to
destroy
it
she
made
a
supreme
effort
to
calm
herself
sufficiently
to
take
the
test
but
before
the
candidates
were
given
their
papers
miss
phillips
announced
that
she
had
a
matter
of
serious
importance
to
bring
to
their
consideration
it
concerns
one
of
your
sister
scouts
she
said
the
girls
looked
questioningly
from
one
to
another
ruth
only
was
missing
but
no
one
had
thought
anything
of
that
after
her
adventure
on
sunday
they
all
attributed
her
absence
to
the
cold
she
had
contracted
several
of
the
girls
thought
of
marjorie
her
entrance
into
the
troop
had
been
out
of
the
usual
order
of
things
perhaps
miss
phillips
meant
her
the
captain
however
hastened
to
tell
the
story
as
impersonally
as
she
could
consternation
seized
the
group
they
listened
breathlessly
and
now
it
is
for
you
girl
scouts
of
pansy
troop
to
decide
what
must
be
done
with
ruth
henry
shall
we
expel
her
from
the
troop
i
would
like
to
hear
some
arguments
on
both
sides
of
the
ethel
who
probably
disliked
ruth
more
intensely
than
any
other
girl
in
the
troop
and
who
had
originally
been
the
cause
of
her
failing
to
make
the
sorority
spoke
against
her
the
girl
had
broken
the
first
law
of
the
scouts
she
was
a
menace
to
the
welfare
of
the
troop
the
sooner
they
got
rid
of
her
the
better
before
the
speech
was
finished
marjorie
rose
to
her
defense
i
have
known
ruth
a
long
time
she
said
and
i
think
i
understand
her
she
is
dreadfully
ambitious
always
has
been
but
girls
i
think
she
has
learned
her
lesson
and
i
have
forgiven
her
so
can
t
you
do
it
too
oh
please
let
her
stay
in
the
troop
honestly
she
s
suffered
an
awful
lot
already
frances
also
spoke
in
her
behalf
when
the
vote
was
finally
taken
the
ayes
carried
it
twelve
to
four
miss
phillips
promised
to
take
the
news
to
ruth
the
scouts
pledged
on
their
honor
to
drop
the
incident
from
their
minds
all
the
candidates
who
took
the
test
that
night
passed
with
honor
but
marjorie
s
mark
was
highest
of
them
all
be
up
early
morning
to
get
ready
for
our
orphans
said
miss
phillips
as
the
troop
separated
we
want
to
make
them
the
happiest
girls
in
the
we
couldn
t
do
that
said
marjorie
to
lily
because
i
m
the
very
happiest
oh
lil
i
m
really
going
camping
this
summer
chapter
xxvi
the
play
shouted
the
happy
little
girls
leaning
out
of
the
windows
and
waving
their
handkerchiefs
as
the
train
pulled
out
of
the
station
the
following
afternoon
the
scouts
watched
it
until
it
was
out
of
sight
then
they
turned
towards
the
school
marjorie
took
doris
s
arm
i
never
had
such
a
good
time
in
my
life
before
she
said
oh
didn
t
they
enjoy
themselves
though
and
wasn
t
that
tiny
little
one
cute
before
they
had
taken
many
steps
they
met
dorothy
maxwell
coming
from
the
school
where
is
miss
phillips
she
asked
with
concern
back
with
lily
i
think
answered
marjorie
but
what
is
the
matter
dot
you
look
as
if
something
dreadful
has
happened
well
it
has
helen
s
pretty
badly
hurt
helen
stewart
when
she
fell
off
the
swing
yes
i
guess
her
ankle
s
sprained
at
least
maybe
it
s
something
even
worse
by
this
time
miss
phillips
and
the
rest
of
the
scouts
had
reached
the
spot
where
the
girls
had
stopped
and
they
all
crowded
around
asking
questions
i
will
go
to
her
at
once
said
miss
phillips
hurrying
off
with
dorothy
the
girls
resumed
walking
suppose
she
can
t
take
part
in
the
play
suggested
ethel
she
s
leading
lady
you
know
i
think
that
is
what
miss
phillips
thought
of
first
but
of
course
she
wouldn
t
say
anything
said
ruth
nobody
else
could
ever
take
her
place
at
this
late
date
said
doris
besides
we
all
have
our
own
parts
what
would
we
do
oh
maybe
she
ll
be
all
right
by
then
said
marjorie
don
t
let
s
worry
till
we
hear
what
the
doctor
but
the
doctor
s
diagnosis
proved
worse
than
any
of
their
fears
helen
was
suffering
from
a
complicated
fracture
it
would
be
necessary
for
her
to
be
taken
home
on
a
stretcher
and
kept
flat
on
her
back
for
several
weeks
any
participation
in
the
play
was
of
course
out
of
the
question
miss
phillips
called
a
special
meeting
of
the
scouts
that
night
she
was
more
disturbed
than
the
girls
had
ever
seen
her
it
s
all
my
fault
she
said
for
not
having
appointed
an
understudy
why
was
i
so
thoughtless
couldn
t
you
take
the
part
yourself
captain
suggested
ethel
you
must
pretty
nearly
know
it
already
i
do
but
i
m
too
tall
and
i
wouldn
t
mind
that
if
it
were
to
be
given
just
for
our
own
school
but
think
of
the
outsiders
who
will
be
here
with
commencement
in
the
morning
miss
allen
says
almost
all
the
visitors
are
planning
to
stay
over
for
the
play
and
miss
martin
s
whole
school
are
coming
especially
to
see
it
she
covered
her
eyes
with
her
hands
and
uttered
a
long
sigh
captain
said
ruth
suddenly
i
have
the
solution
let
marjorie
take
it
she
s
splendid
at
miss
phillips
raised
her
head
quickly
marjorie
blushed
as
all
eyes
were
turned
upon
her
will
you
do
it
asked
miss
phillips
i
can
miss
phillips
s
face
expressed
blissful
relief
she
could
rely
upon
marjorie
who
always
did
things
well
she
need
worry
no
longer
all
that
week
marjorie
studied
and
rehearsed
when
the
came
on
friday
evening
the
girls
praised
her
performance
but
she
herself
was
not
satisfied
she
realized
that
her
acting
was
stilted
and
miss
phillips
was
forced
to
agree
with
her
when
she
asked
for
her
opinion
but
it
s
all
right
marjorie
the
captain
added
you
can
t
expect
to
do
as
well
as
helen
could
after
she
had
practiced
it
for
but
marjorie
did
expect
to
do
as
well
as
helen
and
she
made
up
her
mind
to
surpass
her
she
put
the
play
aside
from
her
thoughts
played
a
game
of
cribbage
with
lily
and
went
to
bed
early
miss
phillips
had
planned
to
give
the
play
in
the
outdoor
theater
if
the
day
were
fine
when
marjorie
opened
her
eyes
that
morning
and
saw
the
bright
sunlight
it
was
naturally
the
first
thing
she
thought
of
it
would
be
so
much
prettier
to
have
a
background
of
real
trees
and
she
felt
that
with
such
perfect
surroundings
she
could
do
greater
justice
to
the
part
soon
after
breakfast
visitors
began
to
arrive
the
wilkinsons
did
not
especially
care
to
attend
the
commencement
exercises
but
promised
to
get
jack
and
drive
over
in
the
machine
in
time
to
see
the
play
ruth
s
father
and
mother
were
coming
by
train
the
programs
had
already
been
printed
with
helen
stewart
s
name
as
leading
lady
and
marjorie
had
not
told
her
family
of
her
part
in
the
play
it
was
enough
for
them
to
know
that
she
was
at
last
a
girl
scout
and
she
did
not
wish
to
have
them
disappointed
if
her
acting
did
not
equal
their
expectations
marjorie
accompanied
ruth
to
meet
the
train
on
which
her
father
and
mother
would
arrive
they
passed
groups
of
visitors
at
frequent
intervals
on
the
path
and
they
saw
the
seniors
in
their
white
dresses
many
of
them
carrying
american
beauty
roses
here
and
there
on
the
campus
off
under
the
trees
near
the
library
was
the
auditorium
they
distinguished
miss
phillips
directing
the
workmen
in
the
final
decoration
of
the
stage
marjorie
was
not
nearly
so
nervous
as
she
had
been
the
day
before
everything
had
turned
out
so
well
that
she
felt
that
she
must
succeed
now
the
weather
the
gayety
of
the
occasion
and
her
own
calmness
reassured
her
so
you
re
a
girl
scout
at
last
said
henry
to
marjorie
as
they
walked
from
the
train
her
tone
was
a
trifle
condescending
as
if
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
she
had
just
attained
a
distinction
which
her
own
daughter
had
long
since
gained
ruth
noticed
it
and
hastened
to
dispel
her
feeling
you
might
say
marj
is
girl
scout
she
exclaimed
she
s
leading
lady
in
the
play
this
afternoon
really
your
father
and
mother
didn
t
tell
they
don
t
know
it
yet
said
marjorie
it
s
to
be
a
surprise
they
have
a
surprise
for
you
too
if
i
m
not
mistaken
said
henry
mysteriously
marjorie
s
curiosity
was
aroused
but
she
did
not
have
long
to
wait
in
less
than
an
hour
the
wilkinsons
machine
drove
up
to
the
school
marjorie
rushed
down
the
stairs
to
meet
it
and
she
had
not
one
but
two
surprises
john
hadley
sat
on
the
front
seat
beside
jack
in
his
arms
he
held
a
huge
box
which
he
handed
shyly
to
marjorie
i
may
not
be
on
hand
when
you
graduate
he
said
so
i
brought
you
some
roses
to
wear
blushingly
she
thanked
him
and
opened
the
box
i
will
wear
one
this
afternoon
she
thought
but
said
nothing
about
the
play
she
wanted
to
reserve
surprise
till
later
she
hunted
ruth
and
and
henry
and
the
party
went
in
to
luncheon
together
both
girls
excused
themselves
soon
afterwards
to
see
whether
they
could
help
miss
phillips
jack
and
john
hunted
seats
for
the
older
people
and
they
watched
the
crowd
gather
wilkinson
glanced
at
the
names
on
the
program
i
see
ruth
is
in
the
play
she
said
addressing
henry
yes
replied
the
latter
remembering
marjorie
s
desire
to
keep
the
knowledge
of
her
participation
from
her
parents
jack
was
impatient
for
the
play
to
begin
but
he
did
not
conceal
the
fact
that
his
interest
was
centered
in
ruth
his
enthusiasm
however
failed
to
find
a
response
in
john
who
hoped
that
since
marjorie
was
not
in
the
play
she
might
come
and
sit
with
them
for
some
minutes
he
tried
to
save
a
seat
beside
him
but
as
the
theater
became
more
crowded
he
abandoned
the
idea
finally
the
school
orchestra
began
to
play
and
soon
after
that
the
play
commenced
there
was
no
curtain
the
characters
entered
from
behind
the
platform
when
wilkinson
saw
marjorie
she
exclaimed
aloud
look
sam
can
that
be
our
marjorie
john
also
leaned
forward
intently
henry
watched
him
smiling
by
george
it
is
cried
jack
and
she
looks
ripping
too
marjorie
did
more
than
look
ripping
as
her
brother
expressed
it
the
culmination
of
events
the
recent
successes
the
gratification
of
her
dearest
wishes
and
the
excitement
of
the
moment
so
inspired
her
that
she
entered
for
the
time
into
the
peculiar
state
of
mental
detachment
which
actors
sometimes
experience
from
the
instant
she
came
upon
the
stage
until
the
end
she
ceased
to
exist
as
marjorie
wilkinson
so
completely
did
she
enter
into
the
spirit
of
everygirl
and
yet
subconsciously
she
seemed
to
realize
that
this
was
to
be
the
final
crowning
achievement
strangers
exclaimed
at
her
ability
and
the
whole
audience
again
and
again
applauded
the
talent
she
displayed
in
her
acting
once
more
marjorie
was
the
heroine
of
the
day
but
unlike
the
time
of
the
game
ruth
was
not
jealous
it
was
she
who
had
suggested
her
for
the
part
and
she
rejoiced
in
her
triumph
the
old
friendship
was
revived
with
a
new
meaning
ruth
had
profited
by
her
experiences
after
the
play
was
over
and
everyone
had
congratulated
marjorie
jack
turned
to
henry
and
asked
whether
ruth
might
not
be
allowed
to
ride
home
in
their
machine
if
she
wants
to
agreed
henry
and
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
from
the
girl
s
expression
that
she
needed
no
second
invitation
the
girls
changed
into
their
suits
and
came
out
again
the
baggage
had
been
sent
by
train
miss
phillips
doris
and
lily
accompanied
them
to
the
machine
a
month
from
said
miss
phillips
as
she
kissed
the
girls
i
ll
write
you
the
marjorie
leaned
back
in
the
machine
and
smiled
dreamily
she
was
very
happy
she
had
been
made
a
girl
scout
she
was
now
going
home
for
vacation
with
jack
and
john
hadley
and
ruth
to
help
her
to
enjoy
it
and
the
week
of
camping
during
the
following
month
loomed
bright
in
anticipation
remember
going

marj
asked
ruth
interrupting
her
reverie
it
has
all
turned
out
different
from
what
we
expected
hasn

it
different
