chapter
i
off
to
italy
in
a
bedroom
in
an
house
in
a
northern
suburb
of
london
a
girl
of
fourteen
was
kneeling
on
the
floor
turning
out
the
contents
of
the
bottom
cupboards
of
a
big
bookcase
her
method
of
doing
so
was
hardly
tidy
she
just
tossed
the
miscellaneous
assortment
of
articles
down
anywhere
till
presently
she
was
surrounded
by
a
jumble
of
books
papers
music
chalks
pencils
foreign
stamps
picture
crests
balls
of
knitting
wool
skeins
of
embroidery
silk
and
odds
and
ends
of
all
kinds
she
groaned
as
the
circle
grew
wider
yet
the
apparently
inexhaustible
cupboards
were
still
uncleared
could
have
ever
believed
i
have
stowed
so
many
things
away
here
and
of
course
the
one
book
i
want
is
to
be
found
that
what
always
happens
it
just
my
bad
luck
hello
who
calling
here
in
my
bedroom
do
yell
the
house
down
really
vin
you
got
a
voice
like
a
megaphone
you
might
think
i
was
on
the
top
of
the
roof
what
want
now
busy
so
it
seems
commented
the
boy
of
seventeen
sauntering
into
his
sister
room
and
taking
a
somewhat
insecure
seat
upon
a
fancy
table
where
with
hands
in
pockets
he
regarded
her
quizzically
great
scott
what
a
turn
out
you
look
like
a
magician
in
the
midst
of
a
magic
circle
are
you
going
to
witch
the
lot
into
newts
and
toads
whence
this
thusness
you
wo
persuade
me
that
it
a
fit
of
neatness
and
actually
tidying
does
exactly
seem
somehow
hardly
replied
irene
with
her
head
inside
a
cupboard
fact
is
looking
for
my
history
book
i
ca
think
where
the
wretched
thing
has
gone
to
school
begins
and
i
have
touched
my
holiday
tasks
yet
and
what
miss
gordon
will
say
if
i
come
without
those
exercises
i
ca
imagine
i
sure
i
flung
all
my
books
into
this
cupboard
and
of
course
here
the
chemistry
which
i
do
want
but
never
so
much
as
a
single
leaf
of
the
history
do
grin
you
aggravate
me
i
believe
you
taken
it
away
to
tease
me
have
you
confess
now
it
in
your
pocket
all
the
time
irene
looked
eagerly
at
the
bulging
outline
of
her
brother
coat
but
her
newly
formed
hopes
were
doomed
to
disappointment
never
seen
it
what
should
want
with
your
old
history
book
finished
for
good
with
such
vanities
thank
the
fates
do
rub
it
in
it
a
beastly
shame
should
be
allowed
to
leave
school
while
must
go
slaving
on
at
miss
gordon
ugh
how
i
hate
the
place
the
idea
of
going
back
there
it
simply
appalling
a
whole
term
of
dreary
grind
and
only
a
fortnight
holiday
at
the
end
of
it
miss
gordon
gives
the
holidays
if
my
fairy
godmother
could
appear
and
grant
me
a
wish
i
should
choose
never
never
to
see
osmund
college
in
all
my
life
again
i
ask
her
to
wave
her
magic
wand
and
transport
me
over
the
sea
irene
spoke
hotly
flinging
books
about
with
scant
regard
for
their
covers
her
slim
hands
were
dusty
and
her
short
yellow
hair
as
ruffled
as
her
temper
there
was
even
a
suspicion
of
moisture
about
the
corners
of
her
gray
eyes
she
rubbed
them
surreptitiously
with
a
ball
of
a
handkerchief
when
her
head
happened
to
be
inside
the
cupboard
she
did
not
wish
vincent
to
witness
this
phase
of
her
emotions
every
girl
ought
to
be
provided
with
a
decent
fairy
godmother
she
gulped
if
mine
did
her
duty
she
come
to
rescue
me
now
yes
she
would
and
be
quick
about
it
too
how
very
seldom
in
the
course
of
an
ordinary
life
such
wishes
are
granted
not
once
surely
in
a
million
times
yet
at
that
identical
moment
almost
as
if
in
direct
answer
to
her
daughter
vigorous
tirade
beverley
entered
the
room
there
was
a
sparkle
of
excitement
in
her
eyes
and
her
whole
atmosphere
seemed
to
radiate
news
she
ran
in
as
joyously
as
a
girl
clapping
her
hands
and
evidently
brimming
over
with
something
she
was
about
to
communicate
why
mums
mums
darling
what
the
matter
asked
irene
you
look
as
if
you
had
a
fortune
left
you
tell
us
at
once
not
quite
a
fortune
but
next
best
to
it
said
beverley
sitting
down
on
the
end
of
the
sofa
daddy
says
i
may
tell
you
now
bairns
it
has
all
happened
so
suddenly
and
has
been
arranged
in
a
rush
you
remember
dad
mentioning
a
few
weeks
ago
that
southern
the
representative
in
naples
was
very
ill
well
fenton
has
decided
to
send
dad
to
italy
to
take
his
place
for
a
year
at
any
rate
and
perhaps
longer
we
to
start
in
a
fortnight
such
a
stupendous
announcement
required
a
little
realizing
vincent
removed
his
hands
from
his
pockets
you
do
mean
to
say
we
going
he
inquired
jemima
leaving
london
fogs
and
toddling
off
to
italy
materkins
you
take
my
breath
away
how
the
whole
business
to
be
fixed
up
so
soon
quite
easily
we
shall
let
this
house
just
as
it
is
to
atherton
who
will
come
from
the
norfolk
branch
to
fill
father
post
in
london
we
are
to
rent
southern
flat
in
naples
while
he
takes
a
voyage
round
the
world
to
try
to
regain
his
health
dad
means
to
put
you
into
his
office
in
naples
vin
do
look
so
aghast
it
high
time
you
started
and
it
will
be
a
splendid
opening
for
you
and
as
for
renie
of
course
she
too
young
to
leave
school
yet
mums
mums
interrupted
an
agonized
voice
as
irene
took
a
flying
leap
over
her
circle
of
books
and
plumping
herself
on
the
sofa
clutched
tightly
at
her
mother
sleeve
you
not
going
to
leave
me
behind
at
miss
gordon
you
oh
i
die
mums
darling
please
if
the
family
going
to
jaunt
abroad
i
got
to
jaunt
too
say
yes
quick
quick
what
a
little
tempest
you
are
cheer
up
we
never
any
intention
of
deserting
you
we
stick
together
for
a
while
at
any
rate
though
when
we
arrive
in
naples
you
be
packed
off
to
a
madam
so
i
give
you
fair
warning
an
italian
school
irene
gray
eyes
were
round
with
horror
no
an
school
for
girls
do
you
remember
that
charming
proctor
who
stayed
with
us
last
year
on
his
way
from
new
york
to
naples
his
daughter
is
at
this
school
and
he
strongly
recommended
it
it
seems
just
exactly
the
place
for
you
renie
it
will
solve
a
great
problem
if
we
can
educate
you
out
there
it
would
have
complicated
matters
very
much
if
we
had
been
obliged
to
leave
you
in
england
as
it
is
you
be
quite
near
to
naples
and
can
come
home
for
all
your
holidays
hooray
then
i
not
to
go
to
miss
gordon
again
as
we
start
in
a
fortnight
it
not
worth
while
your
beginning
a
fresh
term
at
st
osmund
then
i
need
bother
to
find
the
hateful
old
history
book
i
glad
i
did
do
those
wretched
holiday
tasks
they
just
have
been
sheer
waste
mums
i
so
excited
may
i
begin
and
pack
for
italy
now
i
ca
wait
for
the
next
two
weeks
great
confusion
reigned
in
the
beverley
household
it
is
no
light
matter
to
decide
what
you
need
to
take
abroad
what
you
wish
to
lock
up
at
home
and
to
leave
your
establishment
in
order
for
the
use
of
strangers
inventories
of
furniture
linen
blankets
and
china
had
to
be
written
and
checked
a
rigorous
selection
made
of
the
things
to
be
packed
and
the
luggage
cut
down
to
the
limits
prescribed
by
the
railway
companies
poor
beverley
was
nearly
worn
out
when
at
last
the
overflowing
boxes
were
fastened
the
bags
and
were
strapped
and
the
taxis
which
were
to
take
them
to
the
station
arrived
at
the
door
tears
stood
in
her
eyes
as
she
crossed
the
threshold
of
her
own
house
it
a
tremendous
wrench
she
fluttered
never
mind
mums
consoled
irene
linking
her
arm
in
her
mother
it
an
adventure
and
we
all
want
to
go
you
love
it
when
once
off
no
do
look
back
it
unlucky
your
bag
in
the
cab
i
saw
jessie
put
it
in
hooray
for
italy
say
i
and
a
good
riddance
to
smoky
old
london
in
another
couple
of
days
we
shall
be
down
south
and
turning
into
romeos
and
juliets
as
fast
as
we
can
you
see
dad
learning
a
guitar
and
strumming
it
under
your
balcony
and
serenading
you
no
end
hardly
at
his
time
of
life
said
beverley
but
the
joke
amused
her
she
wiped
her
eyes
and
as
irene
had
hoped
and
intended
stepped
smiling
into
the
waiting
taxi
and
left
her
old
home
with
laughter
instead
of
with
tears
in
her
fourteen
years
of
experience
irene
had
traveled
very
little
so
the
migration
to
italy
was
a
fairy
journey
so
far
as
she
was
concerned
to
catch
the
boat
express
they
had
made
an
early
start
and
they
breakfasted
in
the
train
between
london
and
dover
it
was
fun
to
sit
in
comfortable
padded
armchairs
eating
fish
or
ham
and
eggs
and
watching
the
landscape
whirling
past
fun
to
see
the
waiters
nipping
about
with
trays
or
teacups
and
fun
to
observe
the
occupants
of
the
other
tables
in
the
car
there
was
a
fat
frenchman
who
amused
irene
a
languid
english
lady
who
annoyed
her
an
elderly
gourmand
who
excited
her
disgust
and
a
neighboring
party
one
member
of
which
at
least
aroused
her
interest
and
caused
her
to
cast
cautious
side
glances
in
the
direction
of
the
next
table
this
center
of
attraction
was
a
small
girl
about
eight
or
nine
years
of
age
a
dainty
elfin
little
person
with
bewitching
blue
eyes
and
a
mop
of
short
flaxen
curls
she
was
evidently
well
used
to
traveling
for
she
would
lift
a
tiny
finger
to
summon
the
waiter
and
gave
him
her
orders
with
all
the
of
an
experienced
perhaps
her
treble
voice
was
a
trifle
too
for
the
occasion
and
would
have
been
better
had
it
been
duly
modulated
but
her
parents
seemed
proud
of
her
conversational
powers
and
allowed
her
to
talk
for
the
benefit
of
anybody
within
that
she
excited
comment
was
manifest
for
many
looks
were
turned
to
her
corner
the
criticisms
on
her
were
complimentary
or
the
reverse
is
she
perfectly
gushed
a
young
lady
at
irene
left
sweet
she
ought
to
be
in
the
nursery
instead
of
showing
off
here
came
a
tart
voice
in
reply
from
some
one
whose
face
was
invisible
but
whose
back
and
shoulders
expressed
an
attitude
of
strong
disapproval
hope
we
sha
be
boxed
up
with
her
in
the
same
carriage
to
paris
i
vote
we
give
her
a
wide
berth
at
calais
irene
laughed
softly
the
little
girl
attracted
her
she
felt
she
would
have
gravitated
towards
her
compartment
rather
than
have
avoided
her
but
traveling
companions
were
evidently
more
a
matter
of
chance
than
choice
for
the
crowd
that
turned
out
of
the
train
at
dover
became
mixed
and
mingled
like
the
colored
bits
of
glass
in
a
kaleidoscope
irene
realized
that
for
the
moment
the
one
supreme
and
breathless
object
in
life
was
to
cling
to
the
rest
of
her
family
and
not
to
get
separated
from
them
or
lost
as
they
pushed
through
narrow
barriers
showed
tickets
and
passports
traversed
gangways
and
finally
found
themselves
on
board
the
channel
steamer
bound
for
france
father
who
had
made
the
crossing
many
times
scrambled
instantly
for
and
installed
his
party
comfortably
in
the
lee
of
a
funnel
where
they
would
be
sheltered
from
the
wind
beverley
who
had
inspected
the
ladies
saloon
below
sank
on
her
seat
and
tucked
a
rug
round
her
knees
with
a
sigh
of
relief
it
will
be
the
hole
of
calcutta
downstairs
she
remarked
rather
stay
on
deck
however
cold
it
is
the
mother
of
the
wee
lassie
is
lying
down
already
evidently
prepared
to
be
ill
the
stewardess
says
we
shall
have
a
choppy
passage
she
earns
her
tips
poor
woman
thanks
vincent
yes
i
like
the
please
and
that
plaid
out
of
the
no
i
wo
have
a
biscuit
now
i
prefer
to
wait
till
we
get
on
terra
firma
again
irene
sitting
warmly
wrapped
up
on
her
watched
the
white
cliffs
of
dover
recede
from
her
gaze
as
the
vessel
left
the
port
and
steamed
out
into
the
channel
it
was
the
last
of
old
england
and
she
knew
that
much
time
must
elapse
before
she
would
see
the
shores
of
her
birthplace
again
what
would
greet
her
in
the
foreign
country
to
which
she
was
going
new
sights
new
sounds
new
interests
perhaps
new
friends
the
thought
of
it
all
was
an
exhilaration
others
might
seem
sad
at
a
break
with
former
associations
but
as
for
herself
she
was
starting
a
fresh
life
and
she
meant
to
get
every
scrap
of
enjoyment
out
of
it
that
was
practically
possible
the
stewardess
had
prophesied
correctly
when
she
described
the
voyage
as
choppy
the
steamer
certainly
pitched
and
tossed
in
a
most
uncomfortable
fashion
and
it
was
only
owing
to
the
comparative
steadiness
of
her
seat
amidships
that
irene
escaped
that
most
wretched
of
complaints
de
she
sat
very
still
with
rather
white
cheeks
and
refused
vincent
offers
of
biscuits
and
chocolates
her
sole
salvation
indeed
was
not
to
look
at
the
heaving
sea
but
to
keep
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
magazine
which
she
made
a
pretense
of
reading
fortunately
the
crossing
is
short
and
before
neptune
had
claimed
her
as
one
of
his
victims
they
were
once
more
in
smooth
waters
and
steaming
into
harbor
then
again
the
kaleidoscope
turned
and
the
crowd
of
passengers
remingled
and
walked
over
gangways
and
along
platforms
and
up
steep
steps
and
jostled
through
the
customs
and
said
à
to
the
officials
who
peeped
inside
their
bags
to
find
tea
or
tobacco
and
had
their
luggage
duly
chalked
and
showed
their
passports
once
more
and
finally
after
a
bewildering
of
bustle
and
hustle
found
themselves
with
all
their
belongings
intact
safely
in
the
train
for
paris
irene
had
caught
brief
glimpses
of
the
child
whom
she
named
little
flaxen
whose
mother
in
a
state
of
collapse
had
been
almost
carried
off
the
vessel
but
revived
when
she
was
on
dry
land
again
a
maid
was
in
close
attendance
and
two
porters
were
stowing
their
piles
of
inside
a
specially
reserved
compartment
the
cross
lady
wo
be
boxed
up
with
them
at
any
rate
said
irene
i
saw
her
get
in
lower
down
the
train
it
was
dark
when
they
arrived
in
paris
so
irene
had
only
a
confused
impression
of
an
immense
railway
station
of
porters
in
blue
blouses
of
a
babel
of
noise
and
shouting
in
a
foreign
language
which
seemed
quite
different
from
the
french
she
had
learned
at
school
of
clinging
very
closely
to
father
arm
of
a
drive
through
lighted
streets
of
a
hotel
where
dinner
was
served
in
a
salon
surrounded
by
big
mirrors
then
bed
which
seemed
the
best
thing
in
the
world
for
she
was
almost
too
weary
to
keep
her
eyes
open
if
every
day
is
going
to
be
like
this
we
shall
be
tired
out
by
the
time
we
reach
naples
she
thought
as
she
sank
down
on
her
pillow
traveling
is
the
limit
eleven
hours
of
sleep
however
made
a
vast
difference
in
her
attitude
towards
their
long
journey
when
she
came
downstairs
next
morning
she
was
all
eagerness
to
see
paris
we
have
the
whole
day
here
said
beverley
so
we
may
as
well
get
as
much
out
of
it
as
we
can
daddy
has
business
appointments
to
keep
but
you
and
i
and
vin
renie
will
take
a
taxi
and
have
a
look
at
some
of
the
sights
wo
we
rather
agreed
the
young
people
hurrying
over
their
coffee
and
rolls
i
would
miss
paris
for
worlds
added
vincent
only
do
spend
the
whole
time
inside
shops
mater
that
all
this
fellow
bargains
for
we
compromise
and
make
it
half
and
half
laughed
mother
a
single
day
is
very
brief
space
in
which
to
see
the
beauties
of
paris
but
the
beverleys
managed
to
fit
a
great
deal
into
it
and
to
include
among
their
activities
a
peep
at
the
louvre
a
drive
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
a
visit
to
napoleon
tomb
half
an
hour
in
a
cinema
and
a
rush
through
several
of
the
finest
and
largest
shops
it
different
from
london
quite
decided
irene
at
the
end
of
the
jaunt
it
lighter
and
brighter
somehow
and
the
streets
are
wider
and
have
more
trees
planted
in
them
it
a
terrible
scurry
and
i
should
be
run
over
if
i
tried
to
cross
the
street
the
shops
are
any
better
than
ours
really
though
they
make
more
fuss
about
them
the
little
children
and
the
small
pet
dogs
are
adorable
the
cinema
was
horribly
disappointing
because
they
were
all
american
films
not
french
ones
but
that
light
that
falls
from
the
domed
roof
down
on
to
napoleon
tomb
was
worth
coming
across
the
channel
to
see
yes
mummie
dear
i
thoroughly
like
paris
i
only
sorry
we
have
to
leave
it
so
soon
the
train
for
rome
was
to
start
at
nine
in
the
evening
and
immediately
after
dinner
the
beverleys
made
their
way
to
the
station
it
would
be
a
hour
journey
and
they
had
engaged
two
sleeping
compartments
as
they
are
called
on
the
continental
express
beverley
and
irene
were
to
share
one
and
beverley
and
vincent
the
other
the
beds
were
arranged
like
berths
on
board
ship
and
irene
who
occupied
the
upper
one
found
much
to
her
amusement
a
little
ladder
placed
in
readiness
for
her
climb
aloft
i
do
need
to
use
she
exclaimed
scrambling
up
with
the
agility
gained
in
her
school
gymnasium
how
silly
of
the
conductor
to
put
it
for
me
how
could
the
poor
man
tell
who
was
to
occupy
the
berth
you
might
have
been
a
fat
old
lady
for
anything
he
knew
replied
beverley
settling
herself
on
the
mattress
below
it
was
a
funny
sensation
to
lie
in
bed
in
the
jolting
train
and
irene
slept
only
in
snatches
waking
frequently
to
hear
clanking
of
chains
shrieking
of
engines
shouting
of
officials
at
stations
and
other
disturbing
noises
as
dawn
came
creeping
through
the
darkness
she
drew
the
curtain
aside
and
looked
from
the
window
what
a
glorious
sight
met
her
astonished
gaze
they
were
passing
over
the
alps
and
all
around
were
immense
mountains
great
gorges
full
of
dark
fir
forests
and
rushing
streams
of
green
glacier
water
it
was
very
cold
and
she
was
glad
to
pull
her
rug
up
and
later
to
drink
the
hot
coffee
which
the
made
on
a
in
the
corridor
and
brought
to
those
who
had
ordered
it
overnight
irene
never
forgot
that
long
journey
on
the
continental
express
the
sleeping
compartments
became
by
day
for
the
berths
turned
into
sofas
and
a
table
was
unfolded
where
it
would
have
been
possible
to
write
or
sew
if
she
had
wished
she
could
do
nothing
however
but
stare
at
the
landscape
the
mountains
and
the
great
ravines
and
gorges
were
a
revelation
in
the
way
of
scenery
and
it
was
enough
occupation
to
look
out
of
the
window
switzerland
and
northern
italy
were
a
dream
of
wild
rugged
beauty
but
she
woke
on
the
following
morning
to
find
the
train
racing
among
olive
groves
and
orange
trees
and
to
catch
glimpses
of
gay
unknown
wild
flowers
blooming
on
the
railway
banks
here
and
there
were
stretches
of
the
blue
mediterranean
and
oxen
and
goats
in
the
fields
gave
a
vivid
foreign
aspect
to
the
country
everything
trees
houses
landscape
and
people
seemed
unfamiliar
and
yet
strangely
fascinating
the
bright
land
with
its
sunshine
appeared
to
be
welcoming
her
i
shall
like
it
i
shall
like
it
i
shall
like
it
said
irene
to
herself
hanging
out
of
the
open
window
of
their
compartment
and
watching
some
picturesque
children
who
were
waving
a
greeting
to
the
train
i
i
shall
like
it
put
your
hat
on
and
strap
up
your
said
father
voice
in
the
corridor
outside
everybody
else
has
luggage
ready
and
in
another
ten
minutes
or
so
we
shall
be
in
rome
chapter
ii
the
villa
camellia
the
beverleys
did
not
break
their
journey
in
rome
but
merely
changed
trains
and
pushed
on
southward
irene
was
sorry
at
the
time
not
to
see
the
imperial
city
but
afterwards
she
was
glad
that
her
first
impression
of
an
italian
town
should
have
been
of
naples
naples
is
there
any
place
like
it
in
the
whole
world
irene
thought
not
as
she
stood
on
her
veranda
next
morning
and
gazed
across
the
blue
bay
to
where
vesuvius
was
sending
a
thin
column
of
smoke
into
the
cloudless
sky
below
her
lay
the
public
gardens
in
which
spring
flowers
were
blooming
though
it
was
only
the
end
of
january
and
beyond
was
a
panorama
of
white
houses
green
shutters
palm
trees
picturesque
boats
and
a
quay
thronged
with
traffic
to
that
harbor
and
that
blue
stretch
of
sea
she
was
bound
this
very
day
for
father
and
mother
had
arranged
to
take
her
straight
to
her
new
school
and
leave
her
there
before
they
established
themselves
in
their
flat
we
have
any
time
for
sightseeing
at
present
dear
said
beverley
when
irene
begged
for
at
least
a
peep
at
the
streets
of
naples
we
must
put
off
these
jaunts
until
the
easter
holidays
the
term
has
begun
at
the
villa
camellia
and
you
ought
to
set
to
work
at
your
lessons
at
once
do
pull
such
a
doleful
face
be
thankful
going
to
school
in
such
a
glorious
spot
we
might
have
left
you
at
miss
gordon
i
have
run
away
and
followed
you
somehow
mums
darling
i
do
mind
being
a
few
miles
off
but
i
could
bear
to
feel
the
channel
and
the
whole
of
france
and
switzerland
and
italy
lay
between
us
it
too
far
yes
our
little
family
quartette
is
rather
inseparable
agreed
mother
it
certainly
nice
to
think
that
we
all
hail
the
school
recommended
to
and
beverley
by
their
american
friend
proctor
was
situated
at
the
small
town
of
fossato
not
far
from
naples
the
easiest
way
of
getting
there
was
by
sea
so
luggage
was
wheeled
down
to
the
quay
and
the
family
embarked
on
a
coasting
steamer
father
and
mother
were
of
course
taking
her
and
vincent
accompanied
them
because
they
could
not
leave
him
alone
in
a
strange
city
it
will
be
your
last
holiday
though
young
man
said
beverley
jokingly
so
make
the
most
of
it
you
must
come
with
me
to
the
office
and
start
your
new
career
i
do
know
whether
the
villa
camellia
observes
convent
rules
and
whether
you
will
be
admitted
if
not
you
must
wait
outside
the
gate
while
we
see
miss
rodgers
oh
surely
she
would
be
so
heartless
that
remains
to
be
seen
in
a
foreign
country
the
regulations
are
probably
very
strict
the
beverleys
were
not
the
only
british
people
on
board
the
steamer
parties
of
tourists
were
going
for
the
day
excursion
and
as
much
english
as
italian
or
french
might
be
heard
spoken
among
the
passengers
two
groups
who
sat
near
them
on
deck
attracted
irene
attention
the
central
figure
of
the
one
was
a
girl
slightly
taller
than
herself
a
girl
with
a
long
pointed
nose
dark
hard
bright
eyes
penciled
eyebrows
beautiful
teeth
and
a
nice
color
she
was
talking
in
a
loud
and
affected
voice
and
laying
down
the
law
on
many
topics
to
several
amused
and
smiling
young
naval
officers
who
were
of
the
party
an
elder
girl
like
her
but
with
a
sweeter
mouth
and
softer
eyes
seemed
to
be
trying
to
restrain
her
and
occasionally
exclaimed
oh
mabel
at
some
more
than
ordinary
sally
of
wit
but
the
younger
girl
talked
on
posing
in
rather
whimsical
attitudes
and
letting
her
roving
glance
stray
over
the
tourists
close
by
as
if
judging
the
effect
she
was
making
upon
them
she
showing
off
decided
irene
privately
is
that
on
the
label
of
her
bag
i
hope
to
goodness
she
not
going
to
school
with
me
hello
who
that
talking
english
on
the
other
side
why
little
flaxen
for
all
the
world
what
she
followed
us
down
here
for
the
small
girl
whom
they
had
seen
in
the
train
to
dover
was
undoubtedly
claiming
public
notice
on
their
right
her
childish
voice
was
descanting
freely
about
everything
she
saw
and
people
smiled
at
her
quaint
questions
and
comments
her
mother
still
very
pale
and
languid
made
no
effort
to
silence
her
and
her
father
seemed
rather
to
encourage
her
and
to
exploit
her
remarks
for
the
entertainment
of
several
gentlemen
friends
a
little
bored
by
the
evident
of
these
rival
belles
irene
moved
away
with
vincent
to
a
quieter
corner
of
the
deck
she
was
to
see
more
of
them
soon
however
they
both
disembarked
when
the
steamer
reached
fossato
their
luggage
was
piled
upon
the
carriages
and
she
watched
them
drive
away
up
the
steep
narrow
road
that
led
into
the
town
the
beverleys
had
decided
to
have
an
early
lunch
at
the
hotel
by
the
quay
before
taking
irene
to
school
it
was
their
last
meal
together
so
she
was
allowed
to
choose
the
menu
and
regaled
the
family
on
hitherto
unknown
italian
dishes
winding
up
with
coffee
ices
and
chocolates
i
glad
you
do
cater
for
us
every
day
renie
or
i
should
soon
be
ruined
said
father
as
the
waiter
brought
him
the
bill
now
are
you
ready
if
we
do
hurry
and
get
you
up
quickly
to
school
we
shall
miss
the
boat
back
to
naples
another
package
of
chocolates
you
unconscionable
child
well
put
it
in
your
pocket
and
console
yourself
with
it
at
bedtime
the
concierge
says
our
is
waiting
not
that
any
italian
coachman
minds
doing
that
all
the
same
time
is
short
and
we
had
better
make
a
start
in
that
first
drive
through
the
narrow
steep
streets
of
fossato
irene
was
too
excited
to
take
in
any
details
except
a
general
impression
of
rich
foreign
color
and
high
white
walls
afterwards
when
she
came
to
know
the
town
better
she
realized
its
subtler
points
she
felt
as
one
in
a
dream
when
the
carriage
turned
through
a
great
gate
and
passed
along
an
avenue
of
orange
trees
to
a
large
square
house
pink
and
approached
by
a
flight
of
marble
steps
what
happened
next
she
could
never
clearly
recall
she
remembered
the
agony
of
a
short
wait
in
the
until
miss
rodgers
arrived
how
the
whole
party
including
vincent
were
shown
some
of
the
principal
rooms
of
the
house
an
agitated
moment
of
kisses
then
the
sound
of
departing
wheels
and
a
sudden
overwhelming
sensation
that
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
was
alone
in
a
foreign
land
foreign
and
yet
familiar
for
the
villa
camellia
was
a
skillful
combination
of
the
best
out
of
several
countries
its
setting
was
italian
its
decorations
were
french
and
its
pupils
were
all
unmistakably
and
undoubtedly
irene
was
assured
on
this
point
immediately
for
miss
rodgers
calling
to
a
girl
who
was
passing
down
the
corridor
gave
the
newcomer
into
her
charge
with
instructions
to
take
her
straight
to
the
senior
recreation
room
our
afternoon
classes
begin
at
she
remarked
but
you
will
have
just
ten
minutes
in
which
to
be
introduced
to
some
of
your
schoolfellows
elsie
craig
will
show
you
everything
elsie
made
no
remark
to
irene
perhaps
she
was
shy
but
starting
off
at
a
quick
pace
led
her
down
a
long
passage
into
a
room
on
the
ground
floor
it
was
a
pleasant
room
with
a
french
window
that
opened
out
on
to
a
veranda
where
over
a
marble
balustrade
there
was
a
view
of
an
orange
garden
and
the
sea
round
a
table
were
collected
several
older
girls
watching
with
deep
interest
a
kettle
which
was
beginning
to
sing
upon
a
they
looked
up
with
surprise
as
elsie
ushered
in
the
new
pupil
hello
you
do
mean
to
tell
us
there
another
of
them
exclaimed
a
dark
girl
with
a
long
pigtail
we
had
two
already
why
are
they
pouring
on
us
i
should
like
to
know
it
a
perfect
deluge
i
hate
folks
butting
in
when
the
term
has
begun
said
another
grumpily
we
shall
be
swamped
with
soon
grunted
the
owner
of
the
if
they
expect
coffee
i
tell
them
beforehand
they
just
wo
get
it
she
says
her
name
irene
beverley
volunteered
elsie
craig
in
a
perfunctory
voice
as
if
she
were
performing
an
obvious
duty
and
getting
it
over
oh
indeed
well
now
we
know
so
there
an
end
of
it
it
could
hardly
be
called
a
flattering
reception
the
general
attitude
of
the
girls
was
the
reverse
of
friendly
the
kettle
was
suddenly
boiling
and
they
were
concentrating
their
attention
upon
the
making
of
the
coffee
and
rather
ostentatiously
leaving
the
stranger
outside
the
charmed
circle
irene
used
to
school
life
knew
however
that
she
was
on
trial
and
that
on
her
present
behavior
would
probably
depend
the
whole
of
her
future
career
she
did
not
attempt
to
force
her
unwelcome
presence
upon
her
companions
but
withdrawing
to
the
window
pretended
to
be
utterly
absorbed
in
contemplation
of
the
scenery
she
kept
the
corner
of
her
eye
nevertheless
upon
the
group
at
the
table
the
girl
with
the
long
pigtail
had
made
the
coffee
and
was
pouring
it
into
cups
a
shorter
girl
nudged
her
and
whispered
something
at
which
she
shook
her
head
emphatically
but
the
short
girl
persisted
i
superstitious
affirmed
the
latter
aloud
one
for
sorrow
for
joy
and
three
for
luck
she
the
third
and
she
may
be
a
mascot
i
rather
have
chocolates
than
mascots
said
an
injured
voice
from
behind
a
the
chance
remark
gave
irene
the
very
opportunity
she
needed
she
suddenly
remembered
the
chocolates
her
father
had
handed
her
before
she
left
the
hotel
and
producing
the
package
she
offered
its
contents
after
a
visible
moment
of
hesitation
the
girl
with
the
long
pigtail
accepted
her
hospitality
and
passed
the
delicacies
round
instantly
all
were
chumping
almonds
and
the
icy
atmosphere
thawed
into
summer
everybody
began
to
talk
at
once
there
a
spare
cup
here
if
you
like
some
coffee
yes
rachel
i
offer
it
i
suppose
you
over
fourteen
we
may
make
coffee
after
lunch
if
we
seniors
but
the
kids
allowed
any
you
just
one
minute
to
drink
it
in
before
the
bell
rings
hustle
up
if
you
want
to
finish
it
i
bet
a
cookie
you
a
real
sport
there
the
bell
do
choke
or
you
blight
your
young
career
we
got
to
scoot
quick
come
along
with
me
and
i
show
you
where
irene
taken
in
tow
by
a
girl
with
a
freckled
nose
was
hurried
along
the
corridor
and
up
the
stairs
to
the
classrooms
although
she
had
scarcely
spoken
a
word
she
had
undoubtedly
gained
a
victory
and
had
established
her
welcome
among
at
least
a
section
of
her
schoolfellows
she
did
not
yet
know
their
names
but
names
are
a
detail
compared
with
personalities
and
with
some
members
of
the
she
felt
that
she
might
ultimately
become
chums
do
i
bless
dad
for
those
chocs
she
thought
as
she
took
her
seat
at
a
desk
they
worked
the
trick
if
i
had
nothing
to
offer
that
crew
i
might
have
sat
out
in
the
cold
forevermore
the
dark
pigtail
is
decent
enough
but
if
it
comes
to
a
matter
of
chumming
give
me
for
choice
the
villa
camellia
was
a
for
girls
whose
parents
were
residents
permanently
or
temporarily
in
the
neighborhood
of
naples
it
was
generally
described
as
an
college
for
the
arrangements
were
accommodated
to
suit
the
customs
of
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
miss
rodgers
and
her
partner
miss
morley
the
two
principals
came
respectively
from
london
and
new
york
one
teacher
had
been
trained
in
boston
and
another
at
oxford
while
the
british
section
of
the
community
included
girls
from
south
africa
australia
and
new
zealand
pupils
belonging
to
other
european
races
were
not
received
the
object
of
the
college
being
to
preserve
the
nationality
of
girls
who
must
of
necessity
be
educated
in
a
foreign
land
and
whose
parents
did
not
wish
them
to
attend
italian
schools
the
arrangements
were
of
course
modified
by
the
climate
and
by
the
customs
of
the
country
outwardly
the
villa
camellia
resembled
a
convent
its
garden
was
surrounded
by
immensely
high
walls
edged
with
broken
glass
and
the
only
entrance
was
by
the
great
gate
which
was
solemnly
unlocked
by
old
antonio
the
porter
who
inspected
all
comers
through
a
grille
before
granting
them
admittance
small
parties
in
charge
of
a
teacher
were
taken
at
stated
times
for
walks
or
excursions
in
the
neighborhood
but
no
girl
might
ever
go
out
unless
escorted
by
a
mistress
or
by
her
parents
the
villa
camellia
was
a
little
world
in
itself
and
as
much
retired
from
the
town
of
fossato
as
the
great
gray
monastery
that
crowned
the
summit
of
the
neighboring
mountain
fortunately
the
grounds
were
very
large
so
there
was
room
for
most
of
the
activities
in
which
the
girls
cared
to
indulge
tennis
and
netball
were
the
principal
games
there
were
several
courts
and
there
was
a
gymnasium
where
the
school
assembled
for
exercise
on
wet
days
from
two
flagstaffs
on
the
roof
floated
the
union
jack
and
the
stars
and
stripes
respectively
it
was
an
understood
fact
that
here
britannia
and
columbia
marched
hand
in
hand
with
an
that
recognized
no
distinctions
whatsoever
miss
rodgers
and
miss
morley
who
respectively
represented
the
interests
of
britain
and
america
were
tremendous
friends
miss
rodgers
was
fair
and
rather
plump
and
and
calm
with
a
manner
that
parents
described
as
motherly
and
a
leaning
towards
mathematics
as
the
basis
of
a
sound
education
miss
morley
on
the
contrary
was
thin
and
dark
and
excitable
and
taught
the
english
literature
and
the
general
knowledge
classes
and
was
rumored
though
this
no
doubt
was
libel
to
dislike
mathematics
to
the
extent
of
not
even
adequately
keeping
her
own
private
accounts
the
pair
were
such
opposites
that
they
worked
in
absolute
harmony
miss
rodgers
being
mainly
responsible
for
the
discipline
of
the
establishment
and
acting
judge
and
court
of
appeal
in
her
study
while
miss
morley
supplied
the
initiative
and
kept
the
girls
interested
in
a
large
number
of
pursuits
and
hobbies
which
could
be
carried
on
within
the
walls
of
the
house
and
garden
as
regards
the
british
and
american
maidens
who
made
up
this
brisk
little
community
we
will
leave
some
of
them
to
speak
for
themselves
in
the
next
chapter
chapter
iii
hail
columbia
irene
finding
herself
in
her
new
form
looked
round
inquiringly
a
few
of
the
girls
with
whom
she
had
taken
coffee
were
seated
at
desks
in
the
same
room
but
the
rest
of
the
faces
were
unfamiliar
her
teacher
entered
her
name
on
the
register
and
seemed
to
expect
her
to
understand
the
lesson
which
was
in
progress
but
the
subject
was
much
in
advance
of
what
she
had
hitherto
learned
at
miss
gordon
and
it
was
very
difficult
for
her
to
pick
up
the
threads
of
it
she
grew
more
and
more
bewildered
as
the
afternoon
passed
on
and
though
miss
bickford
gave
her
several
hints
and
even
stopped
the
class
once
to
explain
a
point
irene
felt
that
most
of
the
instruction
had
been
completely
over
her
head
it
was
with
a
sense
of
intense
relief
that
she
heard
the
closing
bell
ring
and
presently
filed
with
the
rest
of
the
school
into
the
for
tea
her
place
at
table
was
between
two
girls
who
utterly
ignored
her
presence
and
did
not
address
a
single
remark
to
her
each
talked
diligently
to
the
neighbor
on
either
side
but
poor
irene
seemed
an
insulator
in
the
electric
current
of
conversation
and
had
perforce
to
eat
her
meal
in
dead
silence
she
was
walking
away
afterwards
in
a
most
depressed
condition
of
mind
when
at
the
door
some
one
touched
her
on
the
arm
you
wanted
in
the
senior
recreation
room
said
a
brisk
voice
rachel
has
convened
a
general
meeting
and
told
me
to
tell
you
so
hurry
up
and
do
keep
folks
waiting
we
want
to
get
off
to
tennis
marveling
why
her
actions
should
hinder
the
tennis
of
the
rest
of
the
community
irene
obeyed
the
message
and
presented
herself
in
the
room
where
she
had
been
introduced
on
her
arrival
it
was
now
full
of
girls
of
all
ages
some
sitting
some
standing
and
some
squatting
on
the
floor
rachel
moseley
the
owner
of
the
long
dark
pigtail
seemed
in
a
position
of
command
for
she
motioned
irene
to
a
vacant
chair
then
rapped
on
the
table
with
a
ruler
to
ensure
silence
she
had
to
tap
not
once
but
several
times
and
finally
called
when
you
all
done
talking
i
begin
there
was
an
instant
hush
at
that
and
though
a
few
faint
snickers
were
heard
most
of
the
audience
composed
itself
decently
to
listen
to
the
voice
of
authority
i
called
this
meeting
began
rachel
because
an
unusual
thing
has
happened
three
new
girls
have
arrived
although
the
term
is
well
under
way
by
the
rules
of
our
society
they
must
give
some
account
of
themselves
and
we
must
explain
what
is
required
from
them
will
they
kindly
stand
up
blushing
considerably
irene
rose
to
her
feet
in
company
with
the
damsel
who
had
crossed
in
the
same
steamer
with
her
from
naples
and
the
child
whom
she
had
privately
christened
little
flaxen
name
and
nationality
demanded
rachel
pencil
and
in
hand
she
wrote
down
irene
beverley
british
without
further
comment
the
fact
was
evidently
too
obvious
for
discussion
at
mabel
hughes
australian
born
in
patagonia
she
demurred
slightly
and
she
hesitated
altogether
at
désirée
legrand
not
english
she
objected
we
do
reckon
to
take
frenchies
here
you
know
but
i
french
came
the
voice
of
the
little
girl
i
as
english
as
anybody
i
am
then
why
have
you
got
a
french
name
legrand
is
french
we
come
from
jersey
very
much
on
the
borderland
sniffed
rachel
what
about
désirée
not
much
wholesome
there
at
any
rate
i
was
called
désirée
because
i
was
so
very
much
desired
mother
says
it
just
fits
me
an
indignant
titter
went
round
the
room
and
rachel
frowned
i
afraid
you
wo
find
yourself
so
much
desired
here
she
said
sarcastically
i
enter
you
british
though
i
have
my
doubts
now
come
along
all
three
of
you
and
lay
your
hands
on
this
book
got
to
take
an
oath
of
allegiance
i
repeat
the
words
and
you
must
say
them
after
me
hereby
promise
and
vow
that
being
of
birth
i
will
uphold
the
integrity
of
great
britain
and
her
colonies
and
of
the
united
states
of
america
and
strive
my
utmost
to
maintain
their
credit
in
a
foreign
land
now
then
do
you
understand
what
your
oath
means
her
eyes
rested
on
irene
as
she
asked
the
question
that
much
embarrassed
damsel
stuttered
hesitatingly
we
not
to
trouble
our
heads
about
learning
foreign
languages
a
delighted
chuckle
came
from
several
members
of
the
audience
at
this
interpretation
of
the
vow
rachel
hastily
condescended
to
explain
oh
no
you
have
to
study
french
and
italian
but
what
we
mean
is
for
goodness
sake
do
stick
on
all
the
airs
and
graces
that
some
of
these
foreign
girls
do
remember
we
plain
wholesome
straightforward
who
play
games
and
say
what
we
mean
and
call
a
spade
a
spade
and
have
done
with
it
whatever
italian
friends
you
may
make
during
the
holidays
please
forget
them
during
and
try
and
imagine
that
the
villa
camellia
stands
in
kent
or
massachusetts
do
you
understand
my
drift
now
oh
yes
sighed
mabel
languidly
patriotism
crystallized
in
a
nutshell
i
suppose
not
going
to
offend
your
prejudices
i
sure
you
better
not
or
you
hear
about
it
said
rachel
looking
at
her
sharply
well
girls
that
the
the
three
freshies
are
admitted
and
you
witnessed
their
vows
just
jolly
well
take
care
they
keep
them
that
all
juniors
are
due
now
at
netball
practice
and
any
seniors
who
want
the
tennis
courts
but
rachel
sentence
went
unfinished
for
her
listeners
were
tired
of
sitting
still
and
the
second
they
found
themselves
dismissed
had
jumped
up
and
fled
from
the
room
now
that
that
ordeal
over
i
guess
you
may
smooth
out
the
kinks
in
your
forehead
honey
said
a
serene
voice
at
irene
elbow
turning
quickly
she
saw
the
short
girl
who
had
braved
rachel
possible
wrath
and
had
offered
her
coffee
on
her
arrival
it
was
a
pleasant
face
that
gazed
into
hers
not
exactly
beautiful
but
with
a
charm
that
eclipsed
all
mere
ordinary
prettiness
the
sparkling
gray
eyes
were
the
cheeks
were
like
wild
roses
under
their
freckles
the
little
nose
held
an
element
of
audacious
sauciness
and
dimples
lay
at
the
corners
of
the
wide
smiling
mouth
i
priscilla
proctor
called
peachy
for
short
oh
yes
i
knew
all
about
you
beforehand
although
you
happen
to
be
the
newest
girl
dad
wrote
me
a
whole
page
wonderful
for
him
and
said
he
stayed
at
your
house
in
london
and
i
was
to
tack
myself
on
to
you
and
show
you
round
and
see
you
did
fret
and
all
the
rest
of
it
are
you
wanting
a
crony
temporary
or
otherwise
then
here
i
am
at
your
service
link
an
arm
and
we
parade
the
place
i
guess
by
the
time
we
finished
there
not
much
you
wo
know
about
the
villa
camellia
have
you
been
here
long
asked
irene
accepting
the
proffered
arm
with
alacrity
and
submitting
to
be
led
away
by
her
cicerone
just
a
year
cried
myself
to
a
puddle
when
i
first
came
but
i
like
it
now
i
did
realize
who
you
were
when
you
first
arrived
or
i
have
given
you
a
tip
or
two
straight
away
thank
goodness
you
fairly
in
favor
with
rachel
at
any
rate
any
one
who
starts
by
offending
her
has
a
bad
term
i
do
envy
mabel
hughes
that
girl
will
get
a
few
before
she
much
older
and
serve
her
right
she
rooms
with
you
well
i
sorry
for
you
i
wish
there
was
a
spare
bed
in
our
dormitory
but
we
full
up
to
overflowing
now
then
i
brought
you
out
by
the
side
door
to
show
you
what
we
consider
the
best
view
of
the
garden
ah
i
thought
it
would
make
your
eyes
pop
out
it
view
is
it
the
garden
of
the
villa
camellia
was
certainly
one
of
the
greatest
assets
of
the
school
and
to
irene
who
had
been
transported
straight
from
the
desolation
of
a
london
suburb
in
january
it
seemed
like
a
vision
of
a
different
world
the
long
terrace
with
its
marble
balustrade
edged
a
high
cliff
that
overtopped
the
sea
while
at
present
the
setting
sun
was
lighting
up
the
white
houses
of
the
distant
outline
of
naples
and
was
touching
the
purple
slopes
of
vesuvius
with
gold
pillars
and
archways
formed
a
pergola
from
which
hung
roses
and
festoons
of
the
trumpetflower
from
the
groves
near
at
hand
came
the
sweet
strong
scent
of
orange
blossoms
and
the
little
favorites
of
an
english
spring
pink
daisies
and
pansies
lifted
contented
heads
from
the
border
below
in
the
basin
of
the
great
marble
fountain
white
arum
lilies
were
blooming
geraniums
trailed
from
tall
vases
and
palms
bamboos
and
other
exotics
backed
the
row
of
lemon
trees
at
the
end
of
the
paved
walk
here
and
there
marble
benches
were
arranged
round
tables
in
specially
constructed
arbors
these
are
our
summer
classrooms
explained
peachy
when
blazingly
hot
we
do
lessons
here
early
in
the
mornings
and
ripping
no
we
do
use
them
at
this
time
of
the
year
because
the
marble
is
cold
to
sit
upon
and
the
garden
is
damp
really
although
it
looks
so
jolly
you
should
see
it
in
a
sirocco
wind
you
would
want
to
have
classes
outside
then
you
bet
it
luck
you
in
the
transition
form
if
you
been
one
of
miss
rodger
elect
eleven
or
one
of
miss
brewster
lambs
i
have
had
to
chum
with
you
by
stealth
have
managed
it
somehow
of
course
to
please
dad
but
it
is
done
here
openly
school
etiquette
is
like
the
law
of
the
medes
and
persians
we
keep
to
our
own
forms
hello

sheila
yonge
sheila
if
you
can
find
any
camellia
buds
that
are
playing
tennis
bring
them

right
here
for
a
little
powwow
with
irene
is
she

since
and
he
wrote
and
told

coals
of
fire
on
her

getting
my
similes

i
mean

right
down
good
time
as
far
as
i

her
think

villa
camellia
is
a
dandy
place
chérie
i
twig
laughed
sheila
i
beat
up
all
i
can
muster
and
she
ran
lightly
away
along
the
terrace
a
decent
girl
though
a
little
hard
of
comprehension
peachy
nodded
after
her
does
she
look
adorable
in
that
blue
she
awfully
pretty
agreed
irene
readily
she
be
the
beauty
of
the
school
if

any
idea
how
to
use
her
advantages
sighed
peachy

that
classical
nose

blaze

into
a
cinema
star
before

hope

raking
a
few
girls

i
misjudged

here

to
say
brought
candy
well
you
a
sport
let
squat
under
the
mimosa
tree
and
hand
it
round
the
little
group
of
peachy
favorite
friends
who
settled
themselves
under
the
yellow
mimosa
bush
to
suck
taffy
and
watch
the
flaming
sunset
were
all
afterwards
intimately
bound
up
with
irene
school
career
each
was
such
a
distinct
personality
that
she
sorted
them
out
fairly
accurately
on
that
first
evening
and
decided
the
particular
order
in
which
they
would
rank
in
her
affections
there
was
jess
cameron
a
jolly
scottish
lassie
she
rolled
her
when
she
spoke
and
was
a
trifle
and
practical
but
was
evidently
the
dependable
anchor
of
the
rest
of
the
crew
the
one
who
made
the
most
sensible
suggestions
and
to
whom
though
they
teased
her
a
little
and
called
her
grannie
they
all
turned
in
the
end
for
help
and
advice
jess
was
slightly
out
of
her
element
in
a
southern
setting
her
appropriate
background
was
moorland
and
heather
and
gray
loch
and
driving
clouds
and
a
breeze
with
fine
mist
in
it
that
would
make
you
want
to
wrap
a
plaid
round
your
shoulders
and
turn
to
the
luxury
of
a
peat
fire
quite
unconsciously
she
suggested
all
these
things
peachy
once
described
her
as
a
living
incarnation
of
one
of
scott
novels
for
she
was
steeped
in
old
traditions
and
legends
and
superstitions
and
could
tell
tales
in
the
gloaming
that
sent
eerie
shivers
down
the
spines
of
her
listeners
or
would
recite
ballads
with
a
swing
that
took
one
back
to
the
days
of
wandering
minstrels
she
was
not
a
girl
to
make
a
fuss
over
anybody
and
she
did
not
greet
irene
with
the
least
effusion
but
her
plain
if
you
a
friend
of
peachy
i
glad
to
see
you
was
genuine
and
better
than
any
amount
of
gush
jess
undoubtedly
had
her
faults
she
was
what
her
chums
called
too
and
she
was
apt
to
be
severe
in
her
judgments
flashing
into
the
righteous
wrath
of
one
whose
standards
are
high
but
her
very
imperfections
were
virtues
gane
and
she
was
a
considerable
force
in
the
molding
of
public
opinion
at
the
villa
camellia
if
jess
calm
canny
and
reliable
stood
for
the
spirit
of
the
north
attractive
persuasive
fascinating
little
delia
watts
represented
the
south
she
came
from
california
and
was
as
quick
and
bright
as
a
constantly
in
harmless
mischief
but
seldom
getting
into
any
serious
trouble
her
highly
strung
temperament
found
school
restrictions
irksome
and
she
was
apt
to
blaze
out
into
odd
pranks
which
in
other
girls
might
have
met
with
sterner
punishment
but
miss
morley
had
a
soft
corner
for
delia
and
though
she
did
not
exactly
favor
her
she
certainly
made
allowances
for
her
excitability
and
her
strongly
emotional
disposition
delia
like
a
marionette
always
dancing
to
some
hidden
string
the
teacher
remarked
once
to
miss
rodgers
she
may
be
but
she
immensely
and
if
we
can
only
pull
the
she
act
the
part
we
want
you
ca
force
her
into
prim
behavior
she
as
much
a
child
of
nature
as
the
birds
and
if
you
clip
her
wings
altogether
you
take
away
from
her
the
very
gift
that
perhaps
god
meant
her
to
use
let
me
have
the
handling
of
the
little
and
do
my
best
to
keep
her
within
bounds
but
she
not
the
disposition
to
made
an
example
of
or
to
be
set
on
the
of
repentance
five
minutes
with
delia
in
private
is
worth
more
than
a
long
public
admonition
you
only
to
look
at
her
face
to
know
her
type
and
miss
rodgers
who
stood
no
nonsense
from
really
naughty
and
turbulent
girls
yielded
in
this
case
and
left
the
exclusive
management
of
delia
in
the
hands
of
her
partner
of
the
seven
damsels
who
sat
under
the
yellow
feathery
flowers
of
the
mimosa
bush
three
of
them
peachy
jess
and
delia
talked
so
hard
and
continuously
that
none
of
the
others
had
a
chance
to
chip
in
with
anything
more
than
an
occasional
yes
or
no
irene
realized
in
a
vague
way
that
esther
cartmel
was
plain
and
stodgy
looking
but
that
every
now
and
then
a
world
of
light
suddenly
flashed
into
her
eyes
and
transfigured
her
for
the
brief
moment
that
sheila
yonge
giggled
at
all
peachy
remarks
and
that
mary
fergusson
was
a
pale
and
weak
copy
of
jess
and
slavishly
followed
her
lead
in
everything
it
was
the
seventh
member
of
the
little
party
however
who
particularly
attracted
her
attention
lorna
carson
was
quiet
probably
from
sheer
lack
of
opportunity
to
speak
but
her
pale
face
was
interesting
and
her
dark
eyes
met
irene
with
a
curious
questioning
glance
it
was
almost
as
if
she
were
asking
have
we
known
each
other
before
irene
could
not
help
looking
at
her
and
ransacking
the
side
cupboards
of
her
memory
to
try
to
light
upon
some
forgotten
clew
as
to
why
the
face
should
seem
half
familiar
have
i
seen
her
in
london
or
is
she
like
some
one
else
no
i
fix
her
at
all
surely
i
must
have
dreamed
about
her
mused
irene
while
aloud
she
said
almost
as
if
compelled
to
speak
have
you
been
long
at
school
here
are
you
english
or
american
or
colonial
or
what
a
little
bit
of
anything
you
like
smiled
lorna
rachel
gets
very
muddled
about
me
i
such
a
sneaking
weakness
for
naples
that
i
believe
she
thinks
i
an
italian
at
heart
that
a
crime
rachel
absolutely
ca
forgive
is
the
last
word
in
her
vocabulary
so
i
gathered
when
she
made
me
take
that
oath
i
suppose
she
head
girl
and
that
why
she
rules
the
roost
is
she
decent
or
does
she
keep
you
petrified
i
do
know
whether
i
expected
to
say
or
to
listen
in
respectful
humility
when
she
deigns
to
notice
me
you
better
not
have
any
with
rachel
broke
in
peachy
though
you
just
jolly
well
have
to
wag
your
tail
the
way
she
wants
she
not
bad
on
the
whole
but
rather
a
tyrant
and
it
would
do
her
all
the
good
in
the
world
if
some
day
somebody
had
the
courage
to
knock
sparks
out
of
her
we
do
what
we
can
in
a
mild
way
here
the
other
chuckled
but
she
got
the
ears
of
both
miss
rodgers
and
miss
morley
and
if
you
go
on
the
rampage
against
her
you
only
land
yourself
in
a
scrape
of
course
for
purposes
of
protection
the
transition
girls
have
to
unite
and
peachy
take
care
exclaimed
jess
warningly
peachy
blushed
crimson
under
her
freckles
i
was
telling
anything
she
retorted
i
suppose
irene
shut
up
well
agnes
said
herself
it
does
matter
what
agnes
said
she
fixed
peachy
proctor
if
you
blab
like
this
you
be
tarred
and
feathered
girl
alive
ca
you
keep
a
still
tongue
in
your
head
if
you
lived
in
the
middle
ages
you
have
ended
your
days
in
a
dungeon
jess
spoke
hotly
and
by
the
general
scandalized
look
on
the
faces
of
the
others
irene
judged
that
luckless
peachy
must
have
been
on
the
verge
of
betraying
some
secret
she
tactfully
turned
the
conversation
with
a
remark
upon
the
beauty
of
the
sunset
and
the
clanging
of
the
garden
bell
opportunely
broke
up
the
gathering
and
sent
the
girls
hurrying
along
the
terrace
in
the
direction
of
the
house
irene
paused
for
a
moment
to
look
back
at
the
sea
and
the
sky
and
the
distant
twinkling
lights
and
to
curtsy
to
the
crescent
moon
that
hung
like
a
good
omen
in
the
dome
of
blue
there
was
a
scent
of
fragrant
lemon
blossoms
in
the
air
and
she
trod
fallen
rose
petals
under
her
feet
suddenly
a
remembrance
of
the
desolation
of
miss
gordon
garden
in
a
february
fog
swept
across
her
mental
vision
whatever
trials
she
might
encounter
here
and
she
did
not
expect
her
new
life
to
be
absolute
paradise
the
environment
of
this
school
in
the
south
was
perfect
and
would
make
up
for
many
disadvantages
give
me
sunshine
and
flowers
and
i
always
worry
on
somehow
she
murmured
plucking
a
little
crimson
rose
and
tucking
it
into
her
dress
for
a
mascot
then
ran
with
flying
footsteps
under
the
orange
trees
to
catch
up
with
her
companions
who
were
already
mounting
the
marble
steps
that
led
to
the
villa
camellia
chapter
iv
a
secret
sorority
the
dormitories
at
the
villa
camellia
were
among
the
main
features
of
the
establishment
and
were
a
source
of
considerable
pride
and
satisfaction
to
the
principals
miss
rodgers
and
miss
morley
they
were
always
shown
to
parents
as
the
very
latest
and
newest
development
of
school
arrangements
some
of
them
were
on
the
second
story
and
some
were
on
the
third
but
all
had
french
windows
opening
onto
long
verandas
on
which
were
placed
large
pots
of
geraniums
or
oleanders
the
walls
were
covered
with
striped
italian
papers
the
frieze
being
and
decorated
with
designs
of
flowers
or
birds
the
woodwork
was
white
the
beds
were
enameled
white
and
the
blankets
instead
of
being
cream
or
yellow
as
they
are
in
england
were
all
of
a
uniform
shade
of
pale
blue
with
blue
to
match
the
whole
of
the
house
was
heated
by
radiators
so
that
the
dormitories
were
always
warm
and
were
used
as
studies
by
the
older
girls
who
did
most
of
their
preparation
there
a
table
with
stood
in
the
middle
of
each
room
and
a
large
notice
enjoining
silence
during
study
hours
hung
as
a
warning
over
every
fireplace
irene
was
given
a
vacant
bed
in
no
on
the
second
floor
and
found
herself
in
company
with
elsie
craig
mabel
hughes
and
lorna
carson
for
the
first
two
she
felt
no
attraction
but
the
last
excited
her
interest
and
curiosity
there
was
an
air
of
mystery
about
lorna
she
asked
questions
but
gave
little
information
in
return
on
the
subject
of
her
own
concerns
her
bright
dark
eyes
were
unfathomable
and
she
kept
herself
to
herself
with
a
reserved
dignity
not
very
common
among
schoolgirls
of
her
age
irene
who
loved
to
chatter
found
lorna
a
ready
listener
and
although
the
confidence
was
not
reciprocated
and
in
consequence
the
friendship
seemed
likely
to
be
rather
it
was
a
friendship
all
the
same
from
the
very
start
at
the
end
of
the
week
moreover
something
important
happened
to
cement
it
for
the
first
seven
days
of
her
residence
at
the
villa
camellia
irene
had
felt
herself
goods
on
approval
peachy
proctor
and
her
chums
had
indeed
given
her
a
welcome
but
afterwards
they
had
held
back
a
little
as
if
testing
her
before
offering
further
intimacy
there
seemed
to
be
some
secret
bond
amongst
them
some
alliance
carefully
hidden
from
the
general
public
she
caught
nods
signs
mysterious
words
and
veiled
allusions
all
of
which
were
instantly
suppressed
when
her
presence
was
noticed
on
the
eighth
day
after
arrival
she
found
a
note
inside
her
desk
it
was
marked
private
this
must
be
opened
in
and
its
contents
must
be
treated
with
the
a
crowded
classroom
with
inquisitive
ready
to
peep
over
her
shoulder
did
not
seem
the
congenial
atmosphere
for
the
opening
of
the
missive
so
irene
was
obliged
to
curb
her
curiosity
until
interval
when
she
gulped
her
glass
of
milk
hastily
took
her
portion
of
biscuits
and
avoiding
conversation
hurried
down
the
garden
to
the
seclusion
of
a
stone
arbor
here
she
tore
open
the
envelope
and
drew
forth
a
large
sheet
of
exercise
paper
on
it
was
printed
in
bold
black
letters
you
are
elected
a
member
of
the
sorority
of
camellia
buds
please
present
yourself
for
initiation
at
prompt
in
no
strictest
secrecy
enjoined
there
was
no
signature
but
irene
gave
a
smile
of
comprehension
dormitory
no
was
shared
by
peachy
proctor
jess
cameron
delia
watts
and
mary
fergusson
there
was
therefore
little
doubt
but
that
she
was
to
be
received
into
the
secret
society
of
whose
existence
she
had
already
gathered
some
hints
i
be
there
at
she
whispered
to
peachy
as
they
trooped
into
the
french
class
replied
that
damsel
just
one
warning
be
scared
at
anything
that
happens
it
all
in
fun
do
say
i
told
you
though
no
i
ca
explain
i
not
allowed
you
soon
find
out
peachy
shook
off
irene
company
as
if
in
a
hurry
to
get
rid
of
her
before
she
asked
any
more
questions
so
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
wait
in
patience
until
the
evening
supper
was
at
and
from
till
half
past
the
girls
did
as
they
chose
those
who
wished
to
study
might
take
the
extra
time
for
preparation
but
work
was
not
obligatory
and
it
was
an
understood
thing
that
in
the
interval
between
supper
and
set
recreation
visits
might
be
paid
to
other
dormitories
and
that
so
long
as
no
noise
reached
the
ears
of
the
prefects
anybody
disposed
to
be
frivolous
might
indulge
in
a
little
harmless
fun
irene
was
not
a
reliable
timepiece
having
bad
habits
of
galloping
and
then
suddenly
losing
so
she
did
not
trust
to
it
but
sat
in
the
hall
with
her
eyes
on
the
big
clock
at
exactly
nine
and
a
half
minutes
past
eight
she
ran
upstairs
and
tapped
at
the
door
of
dormitory
there
were
sounds
of
scuffling
inside
and
an
agitated
voice
squealed
wait
a
minute
but
after
a
few
moments
quiet
reigned
and
somebody
else
called
come
in
feeling
rather
as
if
she
were
awaiting
initiation
into
some
nihilist
association
irene
entered
the
room
as
she
did
so
a
bandage
was
clapped
over
her
eyes
and
she
was
led
forward
blindfolded
it
was
only
after
an
impressive
pause
that
the
handkerchief
was
removed
it
was
well
she
had
been
warned
beforehand
or
the
sight
which
met
her
gaze
might
have
caused
her
to
emit
a
yell
loud
enough
to
attract
the
attention
of
a
passing
prefect
the
villa
camellia
was
admirably
supplied
with
electric
light
but
on
this
historic
occasion
the
apartment
was
illuminated
solely
by
a
couple
of
stuck
in
a
pair
of
vases
their
flickering
flame
revealed
a
solemn
row
of
nine
figures
each
of
which
wore
a
black
paper
mask
with
holes
for
her
eyes
the
general
effect
was
most
startling
and
horrible
and
resembled
a
meeting
of
the
inquisition
or
some
other
society
bent
on
torture
and
dark
doings
repressing
her
first
gasp
however
irene
bore
the
vision
with
remarkable
equanimity
and
advancing
towards
the
dread
figures
waited
obediently
until
she
was
addressed
evidently
she
had
done
the
right
thing
for
the
spokeswoman
clearing
her
throat
began
in
impressive
accents
sister
irene
beverley
you
are
admitted
here
to
be
made
a
member
of
our
sorority
are
you
willing
to
join
and
to
take
the
pledges
yes
thanks
but
please
what
a
sorority
ventured
irene
meekly
two
or
three
distinct
snickers
were
heard
from
underneath
the
black
masks
but
a
voice
murmured
order
and
the
sounds
promptly
ceased
a
sorority
is
a
secret
sisterhood
explained
the
president
just
the
same
as
a
fraternity
is
a
brotherhood
we
call
ourselves
camellia
buds
and
we
members
of
the
transition
who
have
banded
ourselves
together
for
the
purposes
of
mutual
protection
it
a
great
honor
to
be
elected
there
are
only
nine
of
us
so
far
and
we
waited
ever
so
long
to
choose
a
tenth
i
hope
you
appreciate
the
privilege
i
do
indeed
you
ready
to
take
the
vow
then
the
initiation
may
proceed
guard
the
door
please
there
was
a
masonic
quality
about
the
proceedings
two
dark
figures
armed
with
rulers
placed
themselves
at
the
threshold
prepared
to
settle
all
intruders
and
to
preserve
the
absolute
secrecy
of
the
ceremony
will
you
give
your
word
of
honor
to
be
a
loyal
member
of
the
sorority
of
camellia
buds
and
never
to
do
a
dirty
trick
so
long
as
you
remain
at
this
school
asked
the
president
i
promise
replied
irene
at
that
somebody
switched
on
the
electric
light
and
the
members
pulling
off
their
black
masks
disclosed
their
laughing
faces
you
stood
it
i
was
quite
prepared
for
you
to
start
hysterics
and
had
the
sal
volatile
bottle
ready
right
here
chirruped
delia
gayly
we
call
it
our
of
mind
test
explained
president
agnes
blowing
out
the
guttering
candles
if
i
screamed
what
would
have
happened
inquired
irene
probation
for
another
week
till
you
got
your
nerves
we
a
business
with
sheila
just
at
first
she
rather
fluttersome
well
anyway
you
got
through
the
ordeal
and
now
you
a
are
you
proud
rather
is
the
society
limited
to
ten
sorority
please
not
society
it
limited
because
there
is
anybody
else
in
the
transition
who
worth
asking
to
join
most
of
them
are
a
set
of
utter
sneaks
they
may
take
rachel
oath
about
preserving
their
nationality
and
all
the
rest
of
it
but
if
they
to
be
counted
specimens
of
honor
it
makes
one
blush
for
one
mother
country
whichever
side
of
the
ocean
it
happens
to
be
on
oh
you
know
most
of
them
yet
wait
till
you
find
them
out
you
be
glad
then
you
belong
to
us
not
that
we
perfect
of
course
we
do
set
up
as
pharisees
on
the
whole
we
rather
a
lot
of
lunatics
we
just
have
a
little
sport
among
ourselves
to
keep
things
humming
well
now
irene
understands
we
best
get
her
fixed
up
with
a
and
close
the
meeting
but
i
understand
what
for
goodness
sake
is
a
buddy
and
why
must
i
have
one
demanded
irene
tragically
sit
down
there
child
and
let
grannie
talk
to
you
replied
president
agnes
if
you
have
heard
of
a
buddy
yet
it
time
you
did
the
latest
out
they
had
them
at
all
the
camps
last
summer
in
england
as
well
as
in
america
a
buddy
is
a
chum
with
whom
you
pledged
to
do
everything
and
who
bound
to
support
you
for
instance
when
the
bathing
season
is
on
you
must
never
swim
unless
your
buddy
is
swimming
with
you
if
you
go
on
an
excursion
you
stick
to
each
other
tight
as
glue
and
if
one
of
you
is
lost
the
other
is
held
responsible
you
as
inseparable
as
a
box
and
its
lid
or
the
two
blades
of
a
pair
of
scissors
or
a
bottle
and
its
cork
or
any
other
things
you
happen
to
think
of
that
ought
to
go
together
and
are
any
use
apart
we
only
realized
buddies
last
term
explained
peachy
but
the
idea
caught
on
no
end
we
all
went
simply
crazy
over
it
i
do
mind
guessing
that
every
girl
in
this
school
who
worth
her
salt
has
got
her
buddy
she
may
let
it
be
known
outside
her
own
sorority
but
we
are
blind
are
there
other
sororities
in
the
school
then
besides
the
camellia
buds
asked
irene
bless
your
innocence
i
should
think
there
are
there
a
rival
one
in
the
transition
i
rather
fancy
they
snapped
up
mabel
already
i
gave
winnie
a
hint
she
was
to
tackle
because
you
come
to
school
with
an
introduction
to
so
i
ought
to
have
first
innings
the
prefects
have
a
sorority
all
to
themselves
and
the
seniors
have
one
and
as
for
the
juniors
silly
little
things
they
as
transparent
as
glass
with
their
signaling
and
their
grips
and
their
cypher
letters
any
one
can
see
through
them
with
half
an
eye
but
we
wasting
time
we
got
to
fix
you
up
with
a
buddy
and
we
must
be
quick
before
the
bell
rings
may
we
choose
asked
irene
and
her
eyes
fell
longingly
on
peachy
no
we
may
said
president
agnes
firmly
we
have
to
take
what
the
fates
send
us
it
kismet
every
time
we
elect
a
new
member
we
draw
lots
again
for
buddies
it
a
kind
of
general
shuffle
if
we
an
uneven
number
somebody
of
course
has
to
be
odd
man
out
i
was
the
maid
last
draw
and
i
have
had
a
buddy
this
term
remarked
sheila
plaintively
never
mind
ducky
you
bound
to
find
a
partner
now
consoled
delia
it
might
even
be
my
little
self
so
live
in
hope
no
such
luck
groaned
sheila
i
probably
get
joan
and
you
know
she
always
uses
me
as
a
agnes
meantime
was
writing
ten
names
on
ten
separate
pieces
of
paper
and
folding
them
in
identically
the
same
fashion
peachy
offered
the
loan
of
a
hat
and
into
this
treasury
they
were
cast
and
shuffled
the
newest
member
draws
murmured
agnes
and
the
others
pushed
irene
forward
she
chose
two
folds
of
paper
at
a
venture
and
twisted
them
together
then
performed
the
like
service
for
another
pair
until
all
the
ten
were
assorted
the
thrill
of
the
ceremony
was
when
agnes
opened
the
screws
of
paper
and
read
out
the
names
fate
had
mixed
the
camellia
buds
together
thus
peachy

sheila
yonge
jess
cameron
delia
watts
joan
lucas
esther
cartmel
agnes
dalton

irene

whether
the
members
of
the
secret
sorority
felt
satisfied
or
otherwise
with
the
result
of
the
shuffle
etiquette
forbade
them
to
show
anything
but
polite
enthusiasm
each
took
her
buddy
solemnly
by
the
hand
and
vowed
allegiance
peachy
then
produced
what
she
called
the
loving
cup
a
vase
of
brown
pottery
brought
by
jess
from
edinburgh
and
with
the
motto
mak
yersel
at
hame
on
it
in
letters
it
was
usually
a
receptacle
for
flowers
but
it
had
been
hastily
washed
for
the
occasion
and
filled
with
lemonade
a
rather
bitter
brew
concocted
by
peachy
and
delia
from
a
lemon
plucked
in
the
garden
and
a
few
lumps
of
sugar
saved
from
tea
this
was
passed
round
and
the
camellia
buds
gulped
it
heroically
as
a
pledge
of
sisterhood
the
password
is
decreed
agnes
as
the
members
trying
not
to
pull
sour
faces
consoled
themselves
with
candy
and
broke
up
the
meeting
any
one
who
can
think
of
a
stunt
for
next
time
please
bring
along
propositions
we
always
open
to
new
ideas
and
ready
for
a
startler
as
a
direct
result
of
her
admission
to
this
select
sorority
irene
found
herself
flung
by
fate
into
the
arms
of
lorna
carson
had
any
individual
choice
been
allowed
she
would
have
selected
peachy
jess
delia
or
even
sheila
in
preference
but
the
lot
once
cast
she
must
abide
by
it
and
be
content
she
had
a
very
shrewd
suspicion
that
when
the
buddies
got
tired
of
each
other
they
elected
a
fresh
member
and
so
necessitated
a
general
reshuffle
of
partners
and
that
her
admission
to
the
society
had
been
welcomed
as
the
pretext
for
such
a
change
here
she
was
however
pledged
to
intimate
friendship
with
lorna
a
girl
who
half
fascinated
and
half
repelled
her
and
who
though
she
might
possibly
turn
out
trumps
in
the
future
was
for
the
present
at
least
most
difficult
to
understand

irene
beverley
when
she
first
left
the
shores
of
her
native
land
was
a
particularly
jolly
little
britisher
not
at
all
bookish
and
not
accustomed
to
worry
her
head
over
any
of
the
deep
affairs
of
life
but
ready
to
have
a
royal
time
with
anybody
of
similar
tastes
and
inclinations
in
her
first
letter

she
summed
up
the
results
of
a
week
experience

villa

mummie
darling
this
is
to
tell
you
i
am
still
alive
i
a
little
surprised
because
i
thought
math
would
kill
me
miss
bickford
is
most
conscientious
and
insists
upon
finding
out
whether
i
really
understand
or
not
and
it
is
generally
i
suppose
i
was
born
with
a
thick
head
for
figures
anyway
she
seems
amazed
at
my
ignorance
i
lay
the
blame
on
osmund
is
that
mean
of
me
it
my
only
way
of
paying
out
miss
gordon
for
past
scores
i
do
mind
admitting
i
have
warm
times
in
school
over
some
of
the
classes
but
the
rest
of
the
life
is
lovely
miss
bickford
is
often
a
big
thorn
but
peachy
is
a
rose
as
for
lorna
like
one
of
those
tropical
flowers
that
uncle
redvers
grows
in
his
conservatory
how
does
vin
like
being
at
the
office
are
you
straight
yet
at
the
flat
come
and
see
me
as
soon
as
ever
you
can
because
i
a
little
bit
lonesome
and
wanting
my
home
folks
though
i
would
confess
it
to
any
of
these
girls
for
the
world
heaps
of
love
to
dad
and
vin
and
your
dear
self
from
renie
if
irene
who
had
found
her
niche
in
a
congenial
set
at
the
villa
camellia
was
capable
of
feeling
the
pangs
of
homesickness
that
unpleasant
malady
exhibited
itself
with
far
more
serious
symptoms
in
the
case
of
another
new
girl
who
had
entered
the
school
upon
the
same
day
désirée
legrand
could
not
settle
down
among
the
juniors
she
was
used
to
the
society
of
people
and
did
not
take
kindly
to
young
companions
in
the
excitement
of
her
own
affairs
irene
had
hardly
given
the
child
a
thought
since
her
arrival
but
one
afternoon
when
enjoying
a
solitary
ramble
round
the
garden
she
suddenly
came
face
to
face
with
little
flaxen
she
was
shocked
at
the
change
in
her
the
once
pink
cheeks
were
white
and
pasty
and
her
eyelids
were
red
and
swollen
as
if
with
perpetual
crying
hello
whatever
have
you
been
doing
to
yourself
exclaimed
irene
you
look
rather
a
bunch
of
misery
do
you
what
the
matter
désirée
squatting
forlornly
on
the
steps
that
led
to
the
upper
tennis
courts
produced
a
and
mopped
her
eyes
nobody
loves
me
here
she
blurted
out
dramatically
i
just
they
all
laugh
and
call
me
frenchie
i
not
french
and
i
to
be
irene
looked
at
her
and
shook
her
head
that
not
the
way
to
go
about
it
i
afraid
i
sorry
but
you
know
you
just
teasing
if
you
carry
on
like
this
ca
you
brace
up
and
be
sporty
pretend
you
do
mind
anything
they
say
and
soon
stop
but
i
mind
sobbed
the
tragic
little
figure
on
the
steps
i
mind
why
are
they
all
so
horrid
to
me
people
have
always
been
so
nice
till
i
came
here
that
exactly
the
reason
said
irene
grasping
the
situation
and
explaining
it
truthfully
you
been
accustomed
to
be
petted
by
everybody
and
after
all
why
the
other
girls
in
your
form
pet
you
you
do
pet
do
you
désirée
eyes
were
round
with
amazement
well
ca
you
see
school
a
matter
of
give
and
take
if
you
do
something
for
the
rest
they
possibly
like
you
but
they
wo
fall
on
your
neck
just
out
of
sheer
good
nature
why
do
you
write
home
for
a
box
of
chocolates
and
offer
them
round
your
form
i
never
thought
of
it
i
had
some
chocolates
but
i
ate
them
there
you
are
you
expected
to
get
all
the
attention
and
give
nothing
sorry
if
i
seem
brutal
but
it
the
solid
truth
you
take
my
advice
and
cheer
up
instead
of
continually
sniveling
i
been
at
school
myself
since
i
was
seven
and
i
know
a
thing
or
two
if
a
girl
popular
there
generally
some
reason
behind
it
look
here
i
help
you
if
i
can
those
kids
over
there
are
doing
nothing
i
get
them
to
come
and
play
rounders
choose
you
for
a
partner
and
i
back
our
side
to
win
here
peachy
perhaps
she
join
in
too
i
ask
her
irene
rapidly
explained
her
philanthropic
intentions
and
enlisted
both
peachy
and
delia
in
her
team
the
juniors
amazed
and
flattered
at
an
invitation
from
older
girls
were
ready
enough
for
a
game
irene
insisted
upon
the
innovation
of
what
she
called
hunting
in
couples
that
is
to
say
dividing
the
company
into
partners
who
made
the
course
hand
in
hand
she
took
good
care
to
choose
désirée
for
her
and
as
they
were
both
fleet
of
foot
they
scored
considerably
by
the
time
the
bell
rang
they
had
beaten
the
records
look
here
said
irene
addressing
the
juniors
before
they
scooted
away
you
kids
are
missing
a
chance
why
do
you
make
désirée
train
for
the
sports
she
can
run
like
a
hare
with
the
start
she
get
as
a
junior
she
might
win
you
a
trophy
had
it
ever
entered
your
silly
young
noddles
to
see
what
she
could
do
for
your
form
well
you
are
a
set
of
slackers
that
my
opinion
of
you
we
manage
our
affairs
better
in
the
transition
oh
thank
you
thank
you
gasped
little
flaxen
lingering
a
moment
or
two
behind
the
others
you
been
just
great
i
write
to
dad
to
send
me
some
chocs
and
i
wo
eat
a
single
one
myself
they
shall
have
them
all
they
shall
really
with
scarlet
cheeks
and
shining
eyes
she
was
a
different
child
from
the
weeping
niobe
who
had
sat
and
sobbed
on
the
steps
now
if
i
simply
coddled
her
and
sympathized
she
have
cried
a
few
gallons
more
and
have
been
no
better
off
mused
irene
as
her
protégée
danced
away
i
fancy
those
juniors
have
been
fairly
nasty
to
her
though
i
would
tell
her
so
something
ought
to
be
done
about
it
but
the
question
is
i
want
to
have
a
talk
with
peachy
when
i
can
wedge
in
ten
minutes
of
spare
time
all
evening
remembrance
of
little
flaxen
red
eyes
and
white
cheeks
haunted
irene
she
felt
it
ought
not
to
have
been
possible
for
the
child
to
be
so
lonely
and
neglected
granted
that
her
unpopularity
might
be
partly
her
own
fault
boycotting
was
nevertheless
hard
to
bear
it
was
clearly
somebody
business
to
have
looked
after
her
and
that
duty
ought
not
to
have
devolved
upon
a
newcomer
like
herself
who
only
realized
the
necessity
by
the
merest
chance
what
the
use
of
the
prefects
irene
asked
herself
but
she
gave
up
the
answer
and
appealed
to
peachy
at
instead
that
cheery
young
american
took
the
matter
more
seriously
than
irene
expected
there
was
a
very
kind
little
heart
hidden
under
her
bubbles
of
fun
i
call
a
meeting
of
the
camellia
buds
right
now
she
declared
i
guess
we
do
want
any
of
those
poor
babes
crying
their
eyes
out
talk
of
homesickness
you
should
have
seen
me
my
first
week
here
i
brought
four
dozen
to
school
with
me
and
i
used
them
all
it
not
good
enough
prefects
did
you
say
humph
i
do
call
rachel
exactly
laid
out
for
this
job
bring
your
biscuits
to
the
at
interval
and
we
have
a
powwow
about
it
there
was
a
break
between
classes
during
which
the
girls
ate
lunch
and
amused
themselves
as
they
pleased
in
the
house
or
grounds
the
biscuits
three
apiece
were
laid
out
in
rows
on
the
table
together
with
each
pupil
glass
of
milk
as
irene
ran
in
to
take
her
portion
she
heard
a
scrimmage
going
on
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
several
small
girls
were
quarreling
loudly
and
above
the
noise
came
désirée
piping
voice
i
have
had
a
biscuit
for
days
and
it
is
fair
what
all
this
about
asked
irene
striding
into
the
crowd
just
in
time
to
see
mabel
and
another
member
of
the
transition
pass
laughing
through
the
lower
door
there
was
a
babel
in
reply
those
big
girls
come
and
grab
our
biscuits
it
a
shame
of
them
there
ought
to
be
three
apiece
and
there
never
are

something
if
you
get

morning
but
this
business

again
i
no
time
to
stop
now
but
i
inquire
into
this
you
bet
leaving
an
only
partially
satisfied
group
of
small
girls
behind
her
irene
sped
to
her
tryst
in
the
garden
she
took
a
short
cut
and
ran
through
the
orange
grove
where
the
oranges
were
beginning
to
turn
yellow
on
the
trees
then
shamelessly
jumping
over
a
flower
border
of
stocks
and
primulas
crossed
under
the
turned
down
a
side
alley
and
found
herself
in
a
neglected
portion
of
the
grounds
here
there
was
a
very
dilapidated
little
arbor
built
sixty
or
seventy
years
ago
when
the
villa
camellia
had
been
owned
by
an
italian
count
with
a
weakness
for
the
fine
arts
the
roof
leaked
and
a
riot
of
jessamine
almost
hid
the
door
the
had
fallen
and
the
floor
was
a
mass
of
dead
leaves
the
plastered
walls
were
painted
with
frescoes
faded
and
moldy
now
of
a
country
château
with
cypress
trees
and
three
ladies
in
big
plumed
hats
riding
on
white
horses
and
a
gentleman
in
shooting
costume
and
tall
boots
who
wore
side
whiskers
and
carried
a
gun
and
had
four
hunting
dogs
standing
in
a
row
behind
him
all
these
were
rather
stiff
and
badly
painted
yet
gave
an
air
of
neglected
grandeur
to
the
grotto
there
were
marble
seats
and
a
rickety
marble
table
and
a
little
broken
statue
of
cupid
in
the
corner
and
the
floor
under
the
rubbish
was
of
blue
glazed
tiles
so
that
the
building
though
fallen
on
evil
days
still
showed
some
remnants
of
its
former
glory
as
it
was
in
an
spot
and
far
from
the
tennis
courts
it
was
not
often
visited
and
had
therefore
been
appropriated
by
the
camellia
buds
as
a
suitable
place
for
the
secret
meetings
of
their
sorority
the
nine
were
all
assembled
here
waiting
impatiently
for
irene
she
brushed
through
the
doorway
took
her
seat
and
breathlessly
explained
the
reason
of
her
delay
would
you
have
believed
such
meanness
she
ended
peachy
nodded
solemnly
i
told
you
some
of
our
precious
transition
would
make
you
blush
was
it
bertha
i
thought
so
i
knew
she
had
got
hold
of
mabel
i
believe
they
buddies
and
a
charming
pair
they
be
we
shall
have
to
tackle
them
somehow
this
certainly
ca
be
allowed
to
go
on
is
it
a
case
for
the
prefects
asked
irene
addressing
the
president
agnes
forehead
was
drawn
into
a
series
of
puckers
we
hate
telling
she
sighed
the
fact
is
the
prefects
in
this
school
are
quite
what
they
ought
to
be
they
they
do
their
duty
but
they
too
aloof
and
and
bossing
and
the
consequence
is
they
not
popular
and
the
girls
would
as
soon
complain
to
a
teacher
as
to
rachel
or
sybil
or
erica
it
simply
is
done
yet
those
kids
need
a
champion
there
are
several
abuses
among
them
that
i
noticed
myself
guess
we
got
to
take
it
on
then
and
murmured
delia
poor
little
souls
it
a
shame
to
steal
their
we
have
to
stand
over
them
and
act
as
fairy
godmothers
said
sheila
peachy
bounced
suddenly
in
her
seat
sheila
yonge
you
given
me
an
idea
yes
an
absolute
what
the
camellia
buds
ought
to
do
is
to
turn
the
sorority
into
an
amalgamated
society
of
fairy
godmothers
and
each
of
us
take
over
a
junior
to
look
after
and
act
providence
to
it
what
those
kids
are
just
aching
for
only
they
may
know
it
what
good
are
prefects
to
them
except
as
bogies
they
skedaddle
like
lightning
if
they
see
so
much
as
rachel
shadow
they
each
ought
to
have
one
older
girl
whom
they
can
count
on
as
a
friend
a
kind
of
buddy
something
of
the
sort
but
more
like
a
i
vote
we
ask
them
all
to
a
candy
party
and
each
adopt
one
suggested
delia
warmly
there
are
ten
of
us
and
there
are
nineteen
juniors
calculated
jess
how
it
going
to
work
out
why
some
of
us
must
take
twins
or
even
triplets
decreed
peachy
bursting
to
begin
let
have
that
candy
party
right
away
can
anybody
raise
a
lira
or
two
we
give
you
our
subscriptions
back
in
the
house
if
you
act
treasurer
and
wheedle
antonio
fairy
godmothers
limited
it
a
brainy
notion
when
shall
you
ask
those
kids
you
bet
they
buzz
in
like
bees
the
loud
clanging
of
the
garden
bell
which
seemed
to
punctuate
life
at
the
villa
camellia
broke
up
the
meeting
in
a
hurry
and
scattered
its
members
in
the
direction
of
their
classrooms
at
the
first
opportunity
however
irene
unlocked
her
and
took
out
a
contribution
towards
the
candy
party
she
was
not
yet
used
to
the
italian
paper
money
and
had
only
a
vague
idea
of
its
value
but
she
judged
that
two
lire
was
the
expected
amount
and
carried
it
accordingly
to
peachy
dormitory
you
white
angel
it
a
bountiful
i
squared
antonio
he
leave
the
parcel
inside
the
grotto
what
we
should
do
without
that
dear
old
man
i
ca
imagine
i
told
the
juniors
and
they
simply
crazy
to
come
i
fixed
it
up
for
directly
after
tea
antonio
the
old
concierge
who
had
charge
of
the
gate
was
absolutely
faithful
to
his
duties
as
porter
and
guarded
the
villa
camellia
as
zealously
as
a
convent
but
he
was
lenient
on
one
point
he
was
willing
sometimes
to
smuggle
sweets
and
those
girls
who
knew
how
to
coax
could
induce
him
to
make
an
expedition
to
the
confectioner
and
fetch
them
a
small
private
store
of
what
delicacies
they
fancied
he
had
his
own
ideas
of
how
much
was
good
for
them
and
would
never
be
responsible
for
more
than
a
limited
allowance
neither
would
he
undertake
more
than
one
commission
per
week
for
any
single
girl
it
was
a
matter
of
favor
and
to
some
of
the
pupils
he
would
only
grunt
a
refusal
peachy
however
was
a
champion
wheedler
she
had
a
certain
command
over
the
italian
language
and
could
persuade
antonio
in
his
native
tongue
of
the
absolute
necessity
of
her
demands
he
was
quite
generous
on
this
occasion
and
slipped
a
parcel
of
mixed
neapolitan
bonbons
into
the
sanctuary
of
the
deserted
nineteen
interested
juniors
bidden
to
an
unwonted
entertainment
dodged
their
prefect
after
tea
evaded
a
practice
scattered
themselves
in
the
grounds
met
in
the
long
pergola
and
proceeded
to
the
arbor
where
they
were
received
politely
by
their
ten
hostesses
it
was
of
course
impossible
to
accommodate
them
inside
but
the
grotto
was
close
to
the
place
where
paolo
the
gardener
chopped
wood
for
the
stoves
so
there
were
plenty
of
logs
lying
about
that
served
as
seats
in
a
very
short
time
the
guests
were
settled
hospitality
was
handed
round
the
colored
papers
were
removed
from
the
goodies
and
there
was
a
general
abandonment
to
sticky
satisfaction
between
the
first
and
second
distributions
agnes
as
president
of
the
sorority
addressed
the
meeting
we
a
proposition
to
make
to
you
all
she
began
there
are
some
things
in
this
school
that
are
always
quite
what
they
ought
to
be
and
it
rather
hard
for
juniors
to
fight
their
own
battles
sometimes
you
squabble
among
yourselves
oh
know
and
sometimes
you
get
it
hot
from
the
seniors
or
the
transition
well
we
going
to
help
you
each
of
us
means
to
take
on
one
or
more
of
you
and
be
a
sort
of
fairy
godmother
to
you
and
responsible
for
seeing
you
decently
treated
i
understand
there
been
a
little
trouble
about
your
lunch
biscuits
it
bertha
and
mabel
they
real
mean
they
simply
grab
them
oh
do
please
stop
it
and
we
have
had
our
turns
at
the
tennis
courts
and
winnie
borrowed
my
and
wo
give
it
back
agnes
held
up
a
hand
to
stop
the
general
clamor
that
do
she
decreed
i
going
to
sort
you
out
and
give
you
each
to
your
fairy
godmother
and
you
may
pour
your
woes
into
her
ears
and
she
try
her
level
best
to
right
your
wrongs
no
you
say
whom
you
like
to
have
it
who
do
the
choosing
thanks
anybody
who
not
satisfied
can
walk
off
and
she
wo
get
a
champion
at
all
or
any
more
candy
either
i
mean
what
i
say
such
an
awful
threat
reduced
the
juniors
to
order
and
they
submitted
quite
peaceably
to
be
apportioned
among
their
various
benefactresses
irene
secured
little
flaxen
lorna
had
a
pair
of
sisters
peachy
pounced
upon
the
liveliest
trio
and
proclaimed
them
as
her
triplets
and
delia
adopted
the
two
youngest
as
twins
you
can
come
to
us
at
a
pinch
explained
agnes
but
please
remember
we
fairy
godmothers
we
fight
any
just
crusade
but
we
not
going
to
write
your
exercises
for
you
or
pull
you
out
of
scrapes
when
you
do
deserve
it
that
not
our
function
there
you
understand
hand
the
candy
again
somebody
there
another
piece
each
all
round
at
least
and
if
there
are
any
over
i
throw
them
up
and
you
shall
scramble
for
them
the
immediate
effect
of
this
mission
of
the
camellia
buds
was
a
decided
improvement
in
the
conditions
of
the
juniors
next
morning
at
a
contingent
mounted
guard
over
the
biscuits
and
when
bertha
and
mabel
plainly
bent
on
piracy
sauntered
down
the
room
they
were
told
certain
unpalatable
home
truths
and
ignominiously
put
to
rout
stop
that
instanter
commanded
peachy
we
here
to
see
fair
play
snarled
jess
be
content
with
your
own
portions
flared
delia
well
really
who
asked
you
to
boss
retorted
bertha
angrily
nobody
but
we
going
to
stop
your
mean
tricks
so
we
give
you
warning
you
two
are
a
disgrace
to
the
transition
i
do
know
what
flags
you
class
yourselves
under
but
i
sure
neither
america
nor
britain
would
be
proud
to
own
you
you
peachy
eyes
were
snapping
sparks
and
the
matter
might
have
waxed
even
warmer
had
not
rachel
reëntered
the
room
for
a
pencil
she
had
dropped
the
head
prefect
pricked
up
her
ears
at
the
sound
of
the
disturbance
whereupon
mabel
and
bertha
who
knew
they
would
receive
short
shrift
if
she
demanded
an
explanation
made
a
hasty
exit
merely
murmuring
to
jess
and
peachy
as
they
pushed
past
them
we
pay
you
out
for
this
just
you
wait
chapter
vi
among
the
olive
groves
quite
by
accident
as
it
seemed
the
sorority
of
the
camellia
buds
had
turned
itself
from
a
society
instituted
for
mutual
protection
and
fun
into
a
crusaders
union
pledged
like
spenser
red
cross
knight
to
avenge
the
wrongs
of
distressed
damsels
in
the
junior
forms
the
ring
of
battle
certainly
added
a
spice
of
excitement
to
their
secret
it
was
much
more
interesting
to
interfere
personally
on
behalf
of
their
protégées
than
to
place
debatable
matters
before
the
prefects
if
war
were
involved
with
another
sorority
it
could
not
be
helped
and
war
there
undoubtedly
was
bertha
and
mabel
too
clever
to
court
open
ignominy
desisted
for
the
present
from
but
sought
other
means
of
retaliation
it
was
unfortunate
for
irene
and
lorna
that
mabel
had
been
apportioned
to
them
as
a
roommate
both
she
and
elsie
were
members
of
the
rival
sorority
so
there
was
division
in
no
dormitory
sometimes
the
opposing
factions
would
not
speak
to
one
another
at
all
elsie
was
more
than
actively
disagreeable
and
kept
herself
to
her
own
cubicle
but
mabel
was
openly
annoying
she
transgressed
every
rule
of
dormitory
etiquette
dashed
for
the
bathroom
instead
of
waiting
her
due
turn
dumped
her
belongings
on
to
other
people
chairs
spread
the
center
table
with
her
papers
fidgeted
during
study
hours
and
in
various
ways
made
herself
objectionable
irene
and
lorna
as
sworn
buddies
cemented
yet
more
firmly
the
bond
between
them
and
supported
one
another
on
every
possible
occasion
irene
was
really
growing
fond
of
lorna
though
the
latter
might
be
reserved
it
was
something
to
find
a
ready
listener
and
sympathizer
as
a
rule
we
ca
deliberately
choose
our
fate
just
seems
to
send
them
along
and
we
must
accept
them
with
all
their
faults
or
go
without
it
certainly
does
not
do
to
be
too
particular
or
we
may
soon
find
ourselves
chumless
in
the
world
irene
was
rather
lovelorn
for
peachy
but
that
bright
little
american
besides
being
in
an
upper
dormitory
was
by
other
and
though
she
held
out
the
palm
of
good
fellowship
was
too
staunch
a
character
to
desert
old
friends
for
new
she
just
sweet
to
me
but
i
do
count
first
decided
irene
well
it
no
use
being
jealous
if
you
ca
have
the
moon
you
must
be
content
with
a
star
that
all
it
a
vast
amount
better
than
nothing
lorna
might
more
aptly
be
described
as
a
planet
than
a
star
for
her
thoughts
had
started
to
revolve
round
irene
in
a
fixed
orbit
as
regards
her
half
of
the
bargain
she
was
absolutely
content
she
adored
her
buddy
and
blessed
the
lot
that
had
coupled
their
names
together
she
had
not
before
made
a
real
friend
and
irene
affectionate
confiding
disposition
appealed
to
her
she
began
to
try
to
protect
her
and
look
after
her
it
was
really
something
of
the
mother
instinct
cropping
out
she
had
never
possessed
a
sister
or
anything
little
of
her
own
to
love
and
it
was
a
new
experience
to
find
a
girl
rather
small
and
younger
than
herself
who
clung
to
her
and
seemed
actually
fond
of
her
life
which
had
hitherto
been
chilly
and
suddenly
grew
warm
she
had
been
used
to
pose
as
one
who
disliked
school
but
with
this
fresh
interest
her
views
on
the
subject
underwent
a
change
any
girl
must
indeed
have
been
hard
to
please
who
was
not
satisfied
with
the
villa
camellia
and
its
beautiful
italian
garden
all
through
the
month
of
february
flowers
were
in
bloom
there
which
in
england
only
peep
out
timidly
in
april
or
may
and
often
will
not
brave
a
northern
climate
at
all
the
front
of
the
house
was
covered
with
a
glorious
purple
bougainvillea
violets
bloomed
under
the
orange
and
lemon
trees
and
the
camellias
from
which
the
villa
took
its
name
flourished
in
profusion
growing
as
great
trees
ten
or
twelve
feet
high
and
covered
with
white
or
scarlet
blossoms
iris
freesias
narcissus
red
salvias
marguerites
pansies
pink
peonies
wallflowers
polyanthus
petunias
stocks
genistas
arbutula
cinerarias
begonias
and
kept
up
a
brave
display
in
the
border
and
though
they
would
be
more
beautiful
and
luxuriant
later
on
in
the
season
they
nevertheless
dispelled
the
idea
of
winter
the
general
temperature
at
fossato
resembled
an
english
april
the
sunshine
was
warm
but
the
wind
was
apt
to
be
chilly
and
at
it
was
quite
cold
though
never
frosty
the
central
heating
apparatus
was
kept
going
in
the
school
and
the
girls
though
they
might
run
about
without
coats
in
the
sunshine
were
always
required
to
have
a
warm
jersey
at
hand
for
the
wind
at
this
season
could
be
treacherous
and
those
unused
to
the
climate
deceived
by
its
brightness
and
wealth
of
flowers
were
very
liable
to
catch
chills
and
to
be
laid
up
with
feverish
colds
as
the
result
of
their
own
imprudence
sometimes
indeed
a
bitter
sirocco
wind
would
blow
and
bring
torrents
of
rain
to
turn
the
blue
sea
and
sky
to
a
leaden
gray
and
to
blot
out
the
view
of
naples
and
vesuvius
but
it
seldom
lasted
more
than
a
few
days
and
in
a
land
of
drought
was
welcomed
to
refresh
the
gardens
and
to
fill
the
cisterns
and
it
has
been
mentioned
in
a
previous
chapter
that
the
villa
camellia
was
of
necessity
run
somewhat
on
convent
lines
in
italy
young
girls
do
not
walk
about
unchaperoned
as
in
england
and
america
but
are
always
very
closely
escorted
by
older
people
and
it
was
advisable
to
keep
to
the
customs
of
the
country
the
pupils
obtained
most
of
their
exercise
inside
their
own
garden
on
sundays
they
paraded
to
the
british
church
but
otherwise
they
did
not
very
often
go
into
fossato
once
a
week
if
the
weather
were
fine
a
limited
number
were
taken
for
an
expedition
but
irene
had
been
at
school
for
some
weeks
before
this
good
fortune
fell
to
her
lot
one
lucky
wednesday
however
she
found
her
name
and
lorna
written
on
the
list
of
exeats
on
the
and
flew
to
announce
the
glad
tidings
to
her
chum
twelve
of
us
with
miss
bickford
and
miss
parr
as
leaders
wo
it
be
ripping
it
says
monte
pellegrino
where
that
the
big
hill
over
there
oh
great
i
love
a
climb
i
just
dancing
to
go
i
feel
as
if
i
had
been
boxed
up
inside
these
big
walls
for
years
and
years
i
only
wish
peachy
and
delia
had
been
on
the
list
too
but
we
are
exclaimed
delia
excited
voice
behind
her
stella
and
marjorie
both
have
colds
so
we
swapped
places
with
them
and
go
next
time
instead
is
it
fine
i
tingling
right
down
to
my
toes
agreed
peachy
her
jolly
little
freckled
face
one
wide
grin
it
going
to
be
an
afternoon
of
afternoons
if
it
does
rain
said
lorna
eyeing
the
sky
suspiciously
oh
do
be
a
wet
blanket
it
no
use
courting
trouble
honey
as
willy
shakespeare
says
somewhere
oh
well
if
it
was
willy
shakespeare
it
was
somebody
else
who
said
it
and
it
just
as
true
anyway
take
your
umbrella
and
wait
till
the
rain
comes
down
before
you
grumble
i
got
an
exeat
and
i
did
expect
it
and
i
going
off
my
head
a
little
that
all
do
worry
yourselves
about
me
i
sane
at
the
bottom
with
peachy
and
delia
prancing
about
and
hardly
able
to
regulate
their
satisfaction
the
expedition
promised
to
be
a
lively
one
though
the
pair
calmed
down
in
the
presence
of
miss
bickford
and
assumed
a
deportment
of
due
decorum
the
favored
twelve
were
half
seniors
and
half
transition
the
remaining
pair
of
the
latter
consisting
of
bertha
ford
and
mabel
hughes
the
camellia
buds
exchanged
eloquent
glances
at
the
sight
of
their
but
wisely
forbore
to
make
any
provocative
remarks
delia
indeed
even
murmured
something
pleasant
about
the
excursion
to
which
bertha
grunted
a
reply
so
the
party
started
off
in
apparent
harmony
antonio
with
his
big
key
unlocked
the
great
gate
they
filed
through
into
the
road
and
in
ten
minutes
they
had
left
the
quiet
school
behind
them
and
were
down
in
the
gay
little
town
of
fossato
it
was
new
and
wonderful
to
irene
the
wide
main
street
with
its
intense
brilliant
sunshine
contrasting
with
the
deep
shade
of
the
narrow
side
streets
the
open
with
their
displays
of
picturesque
wares
the
stalls
of
fruit
and
vegetables
sold
by
quaint
country
vendors
the
balconies
full
of
flowers
the
kindly
smiling
people
the
pretty
peasant
children
clattering
about
in
heelless
wooden
shoes
the
brightly
painted
carts
and
the
horses
decorated
with
flowers
and
feathers
as
if
for
a
perpetual
may
day
all
made
up
a
scene
that
was
more
like
a
portion
of
a
play
than
a
piece
of
real
life
and
made
her
almost
able
to
imagine
herself
upon
the
stage
of
a
theater
they
had
reached
a
great
square
where
leafless
trees
were
covered
with
a
beautiful
purple
blossom
something
like
mezereon
from
a
marble
fountain
bareheaded
women
with
exquisitely
arranged
dark
tresses
and
bright
handkerchiefs
folded
round
their
shoulders
were
drawing
water
in
brass
pitchers
and
chattering
the
soft
southern
dialect
with
the
pretty
tuneful
neapolitan
voices
that
speak
like
singing
and
sing
like
opera
an
equestrian
statue
of
garibaldi
stood
on
a
pedestal
in
the
midst
of
a
flowerbed
of
gay
geraniums
and
below
in
the
shadow
a
military
officer
with
a
gorgeous
pale
blue
cloak
draped
over
one
shoulder
was
talking
to
two
italian
soldiers
whose
plumed
hats
were
adorned
with
shining
cocks
feathers
miss
bickford
in
the
van
of
the
villa
camellia
queue
strode
on
taking
no
notice
beyond
a
firm
shake
of
the
head
of
the
various
interruptions
that
met
her
path
the
drivers
who
offered
their
carriages
for
hire
the
smiling
women
who
thrust
forward
baskets
of
oranges
for
sale
the
beguiling
children
who
held
out
little
brown
hands
and
begged
for
halfpennies
and
the
vendors
who
spread
out
sets
of
colored
views
of
the
neighborhood
it
was
a
good
thing
that
miss
parr
was
at
the
rear
of
the
procession
to
keep
order
or
the
girls
would
have
succumbed
to
some
of
these
temptations
and
have
broken
rank
an
unpardonable
offense
in
the
eyes
of
the
school
authorities
who
wished
to
keep
up
the
prestige
of
their
establishment
in
the
estimation
of
the
town
and
to
emulate
the
convent
school
on
the
hill
whose
pupils
marched
along
the
high
street
as
demurely
as
young
nuns
turning
out
of
the
piazza
they
walked
alongside
a
deep
natural
gorge
which
divided
fossato
from
the
open
country
this
immense
ravine
was
a
fearsome
place
with
a
sheer
descent
of
many
hundreds
of
feet
its
jagged
rocks
were
clothed
with
bushes
and
creepers
and
clefts
and
the
openings
of
caves
could
be
seen
amongst
the
greenery
the
girls
leaned
on
the
low
wall
and
shuddered
as
they
gazed
down
the
precipice
antonio
and
dominica
say
that
dwarfs
live
in
the
caves
down
there
remarked
peachy
half
the
people
in
the
town
believe
in
them
but
they
too
afraid
to
go
and
see
because
the
dwarfs
have
evil
eye
and
would
bring
them
bad
luck
what
superstitious
nonsense
laughed
rachel
how
they
make
up
such
stuff
not
altogether
such
nonsense
as
you
think
corrected
miss
bickford
who
was
a
student
of
archæology
indeed
find
it
intensely
interesting
it
a
case
of
survival
of
tradition
a
few
thousand
years
ago
no
doubt
a
race
of
little
short
dark
stone
age
men
actually
lived
in
those
caves
and
took
good
care
to
avenge
themselves
on
any
of
the
taller
stronger
tribes
who
interfered
with
them
and
tried
to
push
them
out
of
their
territory
the
remembrance
of
them
would
be
handed
down
long
after
they
had
become
extinct
and
of
course
their
doings
were
exaggerated
and
their
cunning
tricks
were
set
down
to
magic
just
as
the
prehistoric
monsters
lingered
as
dragons
and
firedrakes
so
the
small
early
inhabitants
of
europe
have
passed
into
dwarfs
and
brownies
and
pixies
if
anybody
cared
to
dig
in
those
caves
i
dare
say
flint
weapons
might
be
found
it
a
chance
for
the
local
antiquarian
society
if
they
only
take
it
leaving
the
gorge
the
party
turned
up
a
steep
and
very
narrow
alley
between
walls
nine
or
ten
feet
high
at
the
tops
of
these
walls
were
raised
gardens
planted
with
orange
and
lemon
trees
whose
fruit
in
all
stages
of
green
gold
and
yellow
overshadowed
the
path
across
some
of
them
were
erected
shelters
of
reeds
or
plaited
grass
to
prevent
too
quick
ripening
but
in
some
of
the
orchards
the
crop
was
ready
and
workers
were
busy
with
ladders
and
baskets
gathering
their
early
harvests
it
was
a
picturesque
route
for
the
sides
of
the
deep
walls
were
covered
with
beautiful
maidenhair
ferns
and
over
the
tops
hung
geraniums
or
clumps
of
white
iris
or
purple
stocks
or
clusters
of
little
red
roses
here
and
there
at
a
corner
was
a
wayside
shrine
with
a
faded
picture
of
the
madonna
and
a
quaint
brass
lamp
in
front
and
perhaps
some
flowers
laid
there
by
loving
hands
smiling
little
children
were
playing
about
and
giving
each
other
rides
in
and
at
one
point
the
girls
stood
aside
to
let
pass
a
donkey
so
loaded
with
tiny
bamboo
trees
that
it
looked
a
mere
moving
mass
of
green
at
length
the
deep
alley
between
the
orange
orchards
gave
way
to
a
different
scene
they
had
been
climbing
steadily
uphill
and
now
found
themselves
above
the
fruit
zone
and
among
the
olive
groves
the
high
walls
had
disappeared
and
the
path
ascended
by
a
series
of
steps
gray
olive
trees
were
on
either
side
and
on
the
bordering
banks
grew
lovely
wild
flowers
starry
purple
anemones
lilies
yellow
oxalis
and
the
beautiful
genista
which
we
treasure
as
a
conservatory
plant
in
england
as
it
was
country
the
girls
were
allowed
to
break
rank
and
keenly
enjoyed
gathering
bouquets
they
scrambled
up
the
banks
vying
with
one
another
in
getting
the
best
specimens
the
view
from
the
heights
was
glorious
below
them
stretched
the
of
the
olive
groves
broken
here
and
there
by
the
bright
pink
blossoms
of
a
peach
tree
the
white
houses
of
fossato
gleamed
among
the
dark
glossy
foliage
of
its
orange
orchards
and
beyond
stretched
the
beautiful
bay
of
naples
with
its
sea
a
blaze
of
blue
and
old
vesuvius
smoking
in
the
distance
like
a
warning
of
trouble
to
come
it
was
at
this
point
of
the
walk
that
irene
foolish
luckless
irene
made
a
fatal
mistake
and
as
miss
bickford
afterwards
told
her
wrecked
the
whole
excursion
and
spoiled
everybody
pleasure
she
beckoned
lorna
and
ran
up
a
hill
to
obtain
a
higher
vantage
ground
then
instead
of
descending
by
the
route
she
had
come
she
insisted
upon
taking
a
short
cut
to
rejoin
the
path
and
catch
up
with
the
rest
of
the
party
now
neither
lorna
nor
irene
was
aware
that
the
mountain
was
a
network
of
many
paths
leading
to
little
vineyards
and
gardens
and
that
when
they
ran
down
the
opposite
side
of
the
slope
they
were
striking
a
fresh
alley
altogether
different
from
the
one
along
which
miss
bickford
was
leading
her
flock
for
quite
a
long
way
the
two
girls
walked
on
thinking
they
were
in
advance
of
the
others
and
had
stolen
a
march
upon
them
then
they
sat
down
and
waited
but
nobody
came
it
was
a
considerable
time
before
it
dawned
upon
them
that
they
were
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
party
we
come
wrong
somehow
said
lorna
in
much
consternation
what
had
we
better
do
i
do
know
perhaps
they
not
far
off
i
try
if
i
can
make
them
hear
i
would
shout
objected
lorna
but
she
was
too
late
for
irene
was
already
letting
off
her
full
lung
power
in
a
gigantic
it
had
a
totally
different
effect
from
what
she
anticipated
no
schoolgirls
with
villa
camellia
hats
made
their
appearance
but
some
rough
looking
italian
youths
scrambled
over
a
fence
and
came
sniggering
towards
them
their
manner
was
so
objectionable
and
offensive
that
the
girls
turned
and
ran
they
pelted
down
the
path
anywhere
quite
oblivious
of
the
direction
they
were
taking
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
branching
yet
farther
away
from
their
original
route
they
could
hear
footsteps
and
giggling
laughter
behind
and
they
were
growing
extremely
terrified
when
to
their
immense
relief
they
saw
in
front
of
them
an
elderly
peasant
woman
coming
from
the
town
she
had
a
bright
yellow
handkerchief
round
her
neck
and
carried
on
her
head
a
big
basket
containing
flasks
of
oil
loaves
of
bread
and
some
vegetables
she
stopped
in
some
astonishment
as
lorna
and
irene
rushed
panting
up
to
her
then
glimpsing
the
lads
she
seemed
to
grasp
the
situation
and
called
out
angrily
to
them
in
italian
whereupon
they
promptly
and
rapidly
disappeared
as
she
had
reached
the
gateway
of
her
own
garden
she
motioned
the
girls
to
enter
and
they
gladly
availed
themselves
of
the
opportunity
to
seek
sanctuary
a
large
archway
led
into
a
paved
courtyard
on
one
side
of
which
was
a
little
brown
house
and
on
the
other
a
small
chapel
quite
a
picture
with
its
quaint
tower
and
two
large
bells
their
new
friend
seemed
to
be
the
caretaker
for
she
escorted
them
inside
to
show
them
with
much
pride
an
attributed
to
perugino
and
some
ancient
faded
frescoes
of
haloed
saints
she
gave
them
a
peep
into
her
house
too
and
they
were
deeply
interested
to
see
the
unfamiliar
foreign
home
not
comfortable
according
to
british
or
american
ideas
of
comfort
but
with
a
certain
charm
of
its
own
there
was
a
big
dark
room
on
the
ground
floor
with
an
orange
press
various
agricultural
implements
and
numberless
baskets
for
gathering
fruit
there
was
a
bare
kitchen
with
a
wood
fire
and
a
table
spread
with
cups
and
dishes
then
up
a
winding
stair
was
a
bedroom
with
walls
colored
sky
blue
and
a
veranda
that
looked
down
over
a
glorious
orange
orchard
oh
i
adore
to
go
out
there
said
irene
pointing
to
the
path
that
led
between
the
trees
and
their
hostess
evidently
divined
her
meaning
for
she
not
only
led
her
guests
into
the
garden
but
fetched
a
ladder
climbed
a
tree
and
plucked
each
of
them
a
whole
cluster
of
oranges
surrounded
by
a
bunch
of
leaves
the
girls
were
so
delighted
with
their
entertainment
in
this
italian
cottage
that
they
hardly
wished
to
tear
themselves
away
yet
a
vision
of
miss
bickford
reproachful
face
began
to
hover
before
their
eyes
and
lorna
at
last
suggested
that
they
must
be
moving
i
hope
those
abominable
boys
are
waiting
about
anywhere
outside
shivered
irene
the
same
thought
seemed
to
have
struck
their
hostess
for
she
called
an
elderly
man
evidently
her
husband
who
was
pruning
vines
and
began
a
catechism
as
to
where
her
visitors
lived
lorna
replied
as
well
as
her
knowledge
of
italian
allowed
and
at
the
mention
of
the
villa
camellia
the
pair
nodded
in
comprehension
after
a
brief
conversation
with
his
wife
in
an
undertone
the
old
man
offered
himself
as
guide
and
undertook
to
escort
the
truants
safely
back
to
school
again
a
proposal
which
they
thankfully
accepted
it
would
indeed
have
been
difficult
for
them
to
find
their
own
way
among
the
various
interlacing
paths
and
they
were
particularly
glad
to
have
his
protection
against
possible
there
was
tremendous
trouble
waiting
for
them
at
the
villa
camellia
poor
miss
parr
had
collapsed
almost
into
hysterics
and
miss
bickford
with
two
other
teachers
had
returned
to
the
hillside
on
a
further
search
while
miss
rodgers
was
communicating
by
telephone
with
the
fossato
police
station
and
offering
a
reward
for
any
news
of
their
whereabouts
irene
had
thought
the
principal
could
be
stern
but
she
never
knew
how
her
eyes
could
flash
before
that
interview
in
the
study
both
girls
came
out
quaking
like
jellies
and
weeping
for
all
to
hear
did
you
catch
it
hot
inquired
peachy
sympathetically
linking
arms
with
the
truants
rather
it
is
the
punishments
so
much
it
that
she
made
us
so
our
parole
wo
be
trusted
till
after
we
did
to
run
away
it
was
really
quite
an
accident
cheer
up
consoled
peachy
miss
rodgers
cuts
like
a
steel
knife
but
she
does
bear
grudges
i
will
say
that
for
her
with
some
teachers
you
never
hear
the
last
of
it
but
once
you
worked
off
your
impositions
you
be
quite
in
favor
again
whatever
possessed
you
to
go
and
do
it
though
just
our
wretched
bad
luck
i
suppose
said
irene
rubbing
her
eyes
as
she
turned
up
the
passage
and
deposited
her
confiscated
cluster
of
oranges
as
directed
in
the
pantry
chapter
vii
lorna
enemy
for
the
next
two
weeks
irene
and
lorna
were
strictly
gated
a
great
deprivation
for
it
would
have
been
their
turns
to
go
shopping
with
miss
morley
and
irene
at
least
was
anxious
to
sample
some
of
the
quaint
wares
spread
forth
so
temptingly
in
the
fossato
stores
with
the
exception
of
they
did
not
have
a
chance
to
step
outside
the
grounds
of
the
villa
camellia
the
sunday
expedition
came
as
a
welcome
relief
to
break
the
monotony
the
school
liked
the
little
british
church
at
fossato
it
was
so
utterly
different
from
anything
to
which
they
had
been
accustomed
in
england
or
america
to
begin
with
it
was
not
an
ecclesiastical
building
at
all
but
simply
a
big
room
in
the
basement
of
the
hôtel
anglais
the
walls
had
been
exquisitely
decorated
by
a
french
artist
with
conventionalized
designs
of
iris
in
purple
and
gold
and
through
the
windows
there
was
a
gorgeous
peep
over
the
bay
the
girls
used
to
exercise
much
maneuvering
to
secure
the
seats
with
the
best
view
and
somehow
that
bright
stretch
of
the
mediterranean
seemed
to
blend
in
as
part
and
parcel
of
all
the
praise
and
thanksgiving
that
was
being
offered
punctually
at
twenty
minutes
to
eleven
on
sunday
mornings
the
pupils
and
the
seven
mistresses
would
leave
the
great
gate
of
the
villa
camellia
and
march
into
the
town
along
the
esplanade
under
the
grove
of
palm
trees
then
through
the
beautiful
sheltered
garden
of
the
hôtel
anglais
where
many
exotic
flowers
and
shrubs
were
blooming
and
the
white
arum
lilies
were
like
an
easter
festival
to
the
doorway
under
the
veranda
that
led
to
the
anglaise
et
the
school
practically
made
half
the
congregation
but
there
were
visitors
from
the
various
hotels
and
a
sprinkling
of
british
residents
who
had
houses
at
fossato
when
the
service
was
over
there
followed
a
very
pleasant
quarter
of
an
hour
in
the
piazza
of
the
hotel
the
clergyman
and
his
wife
would
speak
personally
to
many
of
the
girls
and
any
of
the
pupils
who
met
friends
were
allowed
to
talk
to
them
fossato
was
a
popular
resort
from
naples
so
relatives
often
turned
up
on
sundays
and
there
were
many
joyous
reunions
kind
little
canon
clark
and
his
small
wife
were
great
favorites
at
the
villa
camellia
they
were
always
invited
to
school
functions
and
each
term
the
girls
in
relays
of
about
ten
at
a
time
were
offered
hospitality
at
the
villa
bleue
a
tiny
dwelling
that
served
as
parsonage
for
the
british
chaplain
to
go
to
tea
at
the
dear
wee
house
blue
and
with
pink
geraniums
in
its
was
considered
a
treat
and
irene
and
lorna
looked
very
glum
indeed
when
miss
rodgers
kept
severely
to
their
punishment
and
substituted
agnes
and
elsie
for
themselves
in
the
next
contingent
of
guests
you
go
later
on
consoled
peachy
miss
rodgers
is
really
very
decent
in
that
way
she
see
that
you
get
your
turn
once
in
a
term
at
any
rate
last
time
i
went
we
had
hot
brown
scones
and
molasses
oh
they
were
good
there
i
ought
to
have
told
you
that
when
your
off
never
mind
it
will
be
something
to
look
forward
to
we
always
play
paper
games
there
and
they
fun
there
i
am
again
well
if
you
went
it
would
be
over
and
done
with
by
and
still
all
to
come
that
one
way
of
taking
it
oh
it
all
very
well
to
moralize
grumped
lorna
who
was
feeling
thoroughly
cross
it
easy
enough
to
count
up
other
blessings
i
a
blighted
blossom
poor
little
thing
she
lived
all
the
winter
and
died
in
the
spring
quoted
peachy
with
an
extra
wide
grin
cheer
up
do
you
realize
it
only
ten
days
to
oh
do
for
goodness
sake
look
less
like
a
statue
of
melancholy
do
you
know
child
that
you
getting
permanent
wrinkles
along
that
forehead
of
yours
and
it
makes
you
more
like
fifty
than
fifteen
you
too
sedate
that
what
the
matter
with
you
lorna
carson
it
a
fault
that
ought
to
be
overcome
copy
delia
and
me
we
know
how
to
enjoy
ourselves
there
my
lecture
is
over
and
now
let
talk
of
earthquakes
it
all
very
well
for
you
got
everything
you
want
murmured
lorna
bitterly
under
her
breath
some
people
have
half
the
luck
and
it
hard
to
be
content
with
a
short
allowance
and
pretend
you
the
same
as
every
one
else
it
ca
always
be
done
she
turned
away
as
she
said
it
so
peachy
only
caught
the
sound
of
a
grumble
and
did
not
hear
the
actual
words
had
she
done
so
she
might
possibly
have
exhibited
more
sympathy
for
she
was
a
very
girl
neither
she
nor
anybody
at
the
villa
camellia
understood
lorna
in
the
least
so
far
their
classmate
had
been
somewhat
of
a
and
nobody
in
the
transition
had
ever
penetrated
her
husk
of
reserve
there
is
generally
a
reason
for
most
things
in
life
if
we
could
only
know
it
and
poor
lorna
morose
and
hermit
attitude
at
school
was
really
the
result
of
matters
at
home
to
get
into
her
innermost
confidence
we
must
follow
her
to
naples
on
her
holiday
and
see
for
ourselves
the
peculiar
circumstances
amid
which
she
had
been
placed
and
the
disadvantages
that
had
caused
her
to
differ
from
other
girls
lorna
family
was
the
smallest
possible
for
it
consisted
only
of
her
father
nobody
at
the
villa
camellia
had
ever
seen
carson
not
even
miss
rodgers
he
had
communicated
with
her
by
writing
when
he
wished
to
place
his
daughter
at
the
school
but
he
had
never
paid
a
single
visit
to
fossato
he
pleaded
stress
of
business
as
the
excuse
for
this
remissness
but
lorna
herself
knew
only
too
well
that
he
had
no
intention
of
coming
except
to
the
office
at
which
he
was
employed
he
never
went
to
any
place
where
he
would
be
likely
to
meet
english
visitors
the
furnished
rooms
where
he
lived
were
in
the
strictly
italian
portion
of
naples
and
not
in
the
vicinity
of
the
big
hotels
secretly
lorna
dreaded
her
holidays
there
was
nothing
for
her
to
do
while
her
father
was
at
the
office
she
was
not
allowed
to
go
out
alone
and
unless
she
could
induce
fat
signora
fiorenza
their
landlady
to
be
philanthropic
and
chaperon
her
to
look
at
the
shops
she
was
obliged
to
amuse
herself
in
the
house
during
the
day
as
best
she
could
in
the
evening
things
were
certainly
better
her
father
would
take
her
to
dine
at
an
italian
restaurant
and
would
sometimes
treat
her
to
a
performance
at
a
theater
or
cinema
close
at
hand
or
would
escort
her
for
a
lamplight
walk
along
the
streets
but
these
brief
expeditions
were
evidently
made
out
of
a
sense
of
duty
and
carson
was
plainly
unhappy
until
he
was
once
more
ensconced
in
his
own
with
his
favorite
books
and
his
he
had
seen
so
little
of
his
daughter
during
the
five
years
they
had
lived
at
naples
that
though
in
a
sense
he
was
fond
of
her
she
was
more
of
an
embarrassment
to
him
than
an
asset
lorna
realized
this
only
too
keenly
her
sensitive
disposition
shrank
away
from
her
father
she
was
shy
in
his
presence
and
never
knew
what
to
say
to
him
she
seemed
always
aware
of
some
enormous
shadow
that
hung
over
their
lives
and
darkened
the
daylight
what
this
was
she
had
no
means
of
guessing
but
it
was
emphatically
there
she
had
learned
by
bitter
experience
never
to
ask
to
be
taken
to
the
fashionable
portions
of
the
city
she
knew
that
the
sound
of
a
voice
speaking
english
at
a
neighboring
table
was
enough
to
cause
her
father
to
finish
his
meal
in
a
hurry
and
leave
the
restaurant
they
never
went
to
the
british
church
and
even
such
cosmopolitan
spots
as
the
aquarium
or
the
museum
were
equally
taboo
long
and
often
did
lorna
puzzle
over
this
idiosyncrasy
of
her
father
she
retained
vague
memories
of
her
early
childhood
when
he
had
surely
been
utterly
different
and
would
come
into
the
nursery
to
romp
with
her
it
had
not
been
altogether
her
mother
death
that
had
happened
when
she
was
only
six
years
old
and
there
were
bright
memories
after
it
of
happy
times
together
no
it
was
when
she
was
ten
years
old
that
the
unknown
catastrophe
must
have
occurred
which
had
ruined
her
life
she
could
remember
plainly
the
visit
of
several
gentlemen
and
of
loud
angry
voices
talking
inside
the
she
was
standing
on
the
stairs
as
they
came
out
into
the
hall
and
her
father
had
told
her
roughly
to
run
away
then
had
followed
a
hasty
removal
and
they
had
left
their
comfortable
home
in
london
and
had
come
to
live
in
naples
after
a
dreary
time
in
a
italian
she
had
been
sent
to
the
villa
camellia
and
all
link
with
england
was
lost
and
broken
no
aunt
or
cousins
ever
wrote
to
her
and
the
earlier
portion
of
her
life
seemed
a
period
that
was
utterly
ended
so
far
lorna
had
never
had
the
courage
to
make
any
inquiries
into
the
why
and
wherefore
of
this
unsatisfactory
state
of
affairs
if
a
question
rose
to
her
lips
the
sight
of
her
father
forbidding
face
effectually
curbed
her
curiosity
that
some
tragedy
had
been
concealed
from
her
she
was
positive
the
suspicion
nay
the
absolute
certainty
was
sufficient
to
place
a
division
between
herself
and
other
girls
she
would
hear
her
schoolfellows
discussing
their
homes
relations
and
friends
and
when
she
contrasted
their
gay
doings
with
her
own
barren
holidays
she
shrank
into
her
shell
and
would
make
no
allusion
to
her
private
affairs
lorna
an
absolute
oyster
you
can
get
nothing
out
of
her
was
the
universal
verdict
of
her
form
but
if
she
said
little
she
thought
a
great
deal
she
would
listen
jealously
to
the
accounts
of
other
people
fun
and
a
bitter
feeling
had
grown
in
her
heart
why
should
her
life
be
so
shadowed
she
had
as
much
right
to
happiness
as
the
rest
of
the
school
why
should
she
seem
singled
out
by
a
vindictive
fate
and
separated
from
her
companions
in
justice
to
the
girls
at
the
villa
camellia
it
is
only
fair
to
say
that
any
separation
was
entirely
of
lorna
own
making
had
she
been
more
expansive
she
would
have
readily
enough
found
friends
no
one
knew
of
the
misery
of
her
home
life
and
she
was
simply
judged
as
what
her
schoolfellows
thought
her
a
crank
who
refused
to
join
in
the
general
fun
of
the
place
and
in
consequence
was
left
out
of
most
things
irene
pleasant
and
with
all
comers
had
at
once
noticed
this
attitude
of
the
others
towards
lorna
at
the
drawing
of
lots
in
the
sorority
she
had
somehow
realized
that
everybody
was
extremely
thankful
to
have
escaped
having
her
unpopular
chum
as
a
buddy
chance
remarks
and
slight
allusions
hardly
noticed
at
the
time
but
remembered
later
had
confirmed
this
they
not
exactly
unkind
but
they
down
on
that
girl
she
had
concluded
i
have
made
up
my
mind
yet
whether
i
altogether
like
her
but
i
going
to
be
decent
to
her
all
the
same
as
the
very
first
who
had
treated
her
on
a
real
equality
of
girlhood
irene
had
been
placed
on
a
pedestal
in
lorna
empty
heart
the
separation
between
the
two
added
to
the
loneliness
of
the
latter
brief
holiday
she
had
never
missed
school
so
much
before
or
hated
her
surroundings
so
entirely
the
long
dragged
itself
slowly
away
sunday
was
wet
and
they
stayed
all
day
in
the
little
carson
reading
as
usual
and
lorna
trying
to
amuse
herself
with
italian
magazines
and
fidgeting
as
much
as
she
dared
towards
evening
the
rain
cleared
a
little
and
her
father
went
out
refusing
however
to
allow
her
to
accompany
him
at
the
end
of
an
hour
he
returned
and
flung
himself
heavily
into
his
chair
he
was
in
a
state
such
as
she
had
never
witnessed
before
violently
excited
with
glaring
eyes
and
twitching
hands
lorna
he
exclaimed
in
quick
panting
accents
i
have
met
my
enemy
the
man
who
ruined
me
yes
the
man
who
deliberately
blackened
and
ruined
me
lorna
turned
to
him
half
frightened
what
is
it
father
she
asked
have
you
an
enemy
you
never
let
me
know
before
oh
i
wish
you
tell
me
i
fifteen
now
and
surely
old
enough
to
hear
it
so
horrible
to
feel
there
something
you
always
keeping
from
me
i
suppose
you
find
out
some
time
so
i
may
as
well
tell
you
myself
replied
carson
grimly
i
a
wronged
ruined
man
lorna
suffering
for
the
sin
of
another
who
goes
scotfree
the
world
judged
me
guilty
of
embezzlement
but
before
god
i
am
innocent
i
never
touched
a
penny
of
the
money
do
you
believe
me
innocent
surely
my
own
daughter
wo
turn
against
me
no
no
father
indeed
i
believe
you
innocent
tell
me
how
it
happened
was
it
when
we
left
london
i
seem
to
remember
the
trouble
there
was
then
though
you
never
explained
we
had
a
different
name
then
had
we
you
were
too
young
at
the
time
to
understand
and
it
was
a
subject
i
wished
to
revive
briefly
a
big
sum
for
which
i
was
responsible
disappeared
the
head
of
the
firm
believed
me
guilty
but
for
the
sake
of
old
associations
he
would
not
prosecute
he
simply
told
me
to
go
i
consulted
my
lawyer
and
if
there
had
been
the
slightest
chance
of
clearing
myself
i
have
fought
the
matter
to
a
finish
but
he
told
me
my
case
had
a
leg
to
stand
on
and
that
if
i
were
foolish
enough
to
bring
it
into
court
i
should
certainly
be
convicted
of
embezzlement
and
sent
to
penal
servitude
that
it
was
only
the
clemency
of
my
attitude
that
saved
me
and
that
he
advised
me
to
go
abroad
while
i
could
so
i
left
england
in
a
hurry
a
disgraced
man
disowned
by
his
family
and
his
friends
i
changed
my
name
to
carson
and
through
the
kindness
of
a
business
acquaintance
i
was
offered
a
clerkship
in
an
italian
in
naples
which
post
i
have
kept
ever
since
how
i
should
otherwise
have
made
a
living
god
only
knows
it
always
my
haunting
fear
that
some
one
in
naples
will
recognize
me
and
tell
them
at
the
office
who
i
am
if
that
old
story
leaks
out
i
may
once
more
be
ruined
but
who
did
it
father
asked
lorna
had
you
no
clew
at
all
not
enough
to
convict
only
a
strong
suspicion
so
strong
that
it
is
practically
a
certainty
the
man
who
ruined
me
was
once
my
friend
now
for
five
long
years
he
has
been
my
bitterest
enemy
we
were
both
heads
of
departments
in
the
firm
of
burgess
and
co
probably
he
a
partner
now
as
i
ought
to
have
been
i
never
heard
news
of
him
since
i
left
london
but
i
saw
him
in
the
corso
i
saw
him
plainly
without
any
possibility
of
mistake
what
is
he
doing
in
naples
has
he
come
here
to
ruin
me
again
no
no
dad
surely
not
perhaps
he
does
know
you
in
italy
probably
he
only
taking
a
holiday
and
will
go
back
to
england
soon
faltered
lorna
suddenly
realizing
that
in
her
father
excited
nervous
condition
she
ought
to
offer
consolation
and
soothe
him
instead
of
adding
to
his
agitation
it
very
unlikely
that
he
would
find
you
out
dad
do
grieve
so
she
went
near
to
her
father
chair
and
laid
a
timid
hand
on
his
shoulder
an
immense
gush
of
pity
for
him
flooded
her
heart
if
she
had
known
this
story
before
she
would
have
understood
and
instead
of
thinking
him
unkind
and
misanthropic
she
would
have
tried
to
be
a
better
daughter
to
him
the
knowledge
illuminated
all
the
past
and
seemed
to
draw
them
closely
together
would
have
believed
in
you
dad
she
ventured
to
say
thank
god
she
never
knew
she
was
spared
that
at
any
rate
i
raged
against
providence
when
i
lost
her
but
afterwards
i
felt
she
had
been
away
from
the
evil
to
come
her
relations
thought
me
guilty
i
went
to
them
and
explained
but
they
practically
told
me
i
was
lying
when
i
went
abroad
i
never
sent
them
my
address
i
just
wished
to
vanish
i
do
suppose
they
have
ever
troubled
to
inquire
for
me
who
cares
about
a
ruined
and
disgraced
man
care
dad
said
lorna
i
only
fifteen
and
i
ca
understand
everything
but
if
you
let
me
the
least
little
bit
take
place
may
i
try
i
not
much
but
perhaps
i
better
than
nobody
and
we
two
seem
all
alone
in
the
world
for
the
first
time
in
five
years
the
barrier
between
them
was
down
and
lorna
was
hugging
her
father
as
in
the
old
happy
childish
days
to
know
all
is
to
forgive
all
and
her
resentment
against
his
treatment
of
her
turned
into
a
deep
pitying
love
she
would
never
be
frightened
of
him
again
a
new
impulse
seemed
to
have
come
to
her
if
she
could
in
any
way
comfort
him
for
what
he
had
suffered
it
would
be
something
to
live
for
he
my
father
and
i
stick
to
him
through
thick
and
thin
she
said
to
herself
fiercely
as
she
went
to
bed
that
night
i
do
know
who
this
enemy
is
but
if
ever
i
meet
him
i
hate
him
and
all
belonging
to
him
i
say
it
and
i
do
go
back
on
my
word
i
be
my
own
witness
as
nobody
else
is
present
lorna
carson
you
taken
up
a
feud
and
you
got
to
carry
it
through
may
all
the
bad
luck
in
the
world
come
down
upon
you
if
you
break

chapter
viii
at
pompeii
lorna
returned
to
fossato
feeling
as
if
she
had
passed
through
a
great
crisis
the
short
and
its
revelation
seemed
to
have
added
years
to
her
life
she
had
never
been
a
typical
specimen
of
sparkling
girlhood
but
her
new
knowledge
made
her
more
sedate
than
ever
it
brought
her
both
gain
and
loss
gain
in
the
fact
that
she
now
shared
her
father
confidence
and
could
help
him
to
bear
his
heavy
burden
and
loss
in
the
sense
of
a
yet
wider
division
between
herself
and
her
schoolmates
she
realized
now
only
too
bitterly
why
her
father
so
persistently
shunned
all
english
people
it
would
surely
have
been
better
to
have
placed
her
at
an
italian
school
than
among
girls
of
her
own
nationality
lorna
naturally
morbid
and
shrank
yet
deeper
into
her
shell
and
became
more
than
ever
her
one
bright
spot
at
the
villa
camellia
was
her
devotion
to
her
buddy
half
a
dozen
other
girls
had
at
various
periods
tried
to
take
lorna
up
but
all
had
promptly
dropped
her
declaring
that
they
could
not
get
any
further
and
that
she
was
a
solitary
irene
after
one
or
two
ventures
realized
that
lorna
was
utterly
reserved
and
uncommunicative
but
was
content
to
continue
the
friendship
on
a
basis
giving
confidences
but
receiving
none
in
return
she
was
a
little
laughed
at
in
certain
quarters
on
the
subject
of
her
chum
hope
you
like
crab
sauce
we
tickled
to
bits
at
the
pair
of
you
it
wo
last
long
shall
we
give
you
an
for
a
birthday
present
you
got
the
champion
of
the
school
are
you
full
of
prickles
go
on
smiled
irene
calmly
i
been
teased
all
my
life
by
my
brother
so
i
pretty
well
say
just
what
you
like
i
sure
i
do
care
it
really
did
not
trouble
irene
that
lorna
should
cling
to
this
habit
of
closeness
she
had
so
many
affairs
of
her
own
in
which
to
be
interested
she
had
spent
a
glorious
holiday
with
her
family
in
their
flat
at
naples
and
was
delighted
to
describe
every
detail
of
her
experiences
she
chatted
about
her
relations
till
lorna
knew
and
beverley
and
vincent
absolutely
well
by
hearsay
though
she
had
never
met
them
in
the
flesh
the
accounts
of
their
doings
gave
her
a
peep
of
home
life
such
as
she
had
not
hitherto
realized
lovely
to
be
you
she
ventured
once
you
must
come
and
see
us
replied
irene
impulsively
i
get
mother
to
ask
you
some
day
do
look
so
scared
they
would
eat
you
you
like
paying
visits
oh
well
of
course
if
you
do
want
to
come
i
wo
worry
you
no
i
not
offended
why
should
i
be
let
everybody
please
herself
is
my
motto
oh
apologize
for
it
really
matter
in
the
very
least
i
far
rather
people
were
frank
and
said
what
they
thought
i
going
with
you
to
pompeii
at
any
rate
said
lorna
glad
they
put
us
both
down
together
for
that
excursion
it
was
part
of
the
educational
scheme
of
miss
rodgers
and
miss
morley
that
the
girls
should
be
taken
to
certain
places
of
interest
in
the
neighborhood
they
were
carefully
prepared
in
class
beforehand
so
that
they
should
thoroughly
understand
what
they
were
going
to
see
all
the
school
studied
greek
and
roman
history
and
since
christmas
there
had
been
special
lectures
by
miss
morley
on
the
buried
city
of
pompeii
illustrated
by
but
photography
however
excellent
is
a
poor
substitute
for
reality
when
the
latter
can
be
obtained
had
the
villa
camellia
been
situated
in
england
or
america
no
doubt
the
pupils
would
have
considered
those
views
a
tremendous
asset
to
their
history
class
but
being
in
the
near
neighborhood
of
naples
they
were
able
to
go
one
better
and
have
actual
expeditions
to
pompeii
itself
a
dozen
of
the
girls
personally
conducted
by
miss
morley
were
to
start
on
thursday
take
their
lunch
and
make
a
day
of
it
most
of
those
chosen
were
comparative
newcomers
to
the
school
or
for
some
reason
had
not
done
the
excursion
before
so
it
would
be
a
fresh
experience
to
nearly
all
of
them
six
seniors
and
six
members
of
the
transition
made
up
the
party
with
little
désirée
legrand
tagged
on
at
the
last
as
a
mascot
because
stella
and
carrie
had
pointed
out
that
twelve
pupils
and
one
mistress
would
make
thirteen
at
table
if
they
had
tea
together
and
though
miss
morley
had
scoffed
at
such
ridiculous
superstition
she
took
désirée
all
the
same
to
break
the
possible
bad
luck
they
had
the
satisfaction
of
assembling
in
the
hall
for
the
start
exactly
as
their
companions
were
filing
into
classrooms
got
your
asked
delia
indicating
her
lunch
satchel
it
would
do
to
leave
those
behind
i
always
feel
famished
when
i
out
sightseeing
hope
i
sha
eat
my
lunch
before
the
picnic
renie
no
use
lugging
that
camera
with
you
you
wo
be
allowed
to
take
any
photos
inside
the
ruins
so
i
warn
you
miss
morley
taking
hers
objected
irene
loath
to
relinquish
the
object
in
question
miss
morley
has
a
special
government
permit
to
sketch
or
photo
in
pompeii
nobody
may
take
the
slightest
or
drawing
without
i
been
once
before
so
i
know
madam
doubtful
you
see
ever
so
many
officials
will
ask
to
look
at
miss
morley
ticket
why
because
the
place
would
get
choked
up
with
artists
i
suppose
and
also
they
want
to
sell
their
own
photos
you
be
pestered
to
buy
outside
the
gates
i
adore
to
get
just
one
or
two
snaps
persisted
irene
i
wo
take
this
big
camera
but
i
slip
my
wee
one
inside
my
pocket
and
see
if
i
find
a
chance
are
you
ready
girls
came
miss
morley
voice
from
the
porch
and
the
waiting
thirteen
formed
into
double
line
and
marched
they
were
to
go
by
the
electric
tram
from
fossato
to
castellamare
from
which
it
was
only
a
comparatively
short
drive
to
pompeii
the
jogging
jolting
little
tramcar
ran
along
the
coast
linking
up
several
towns
and
villages
and
conveying
people
intent
on
either
business
or
pleasure
there
were
many
visitors
anxious
to
make
the
excursion
but
the
contingent
from
the
villa
camellia
had
posted
themselves
by
the
statue
of
garibaldi
in
the
square
and
scrambled
for
the
car
as
soon
as
it
arrived
boarding
it
with
three
hatless
italian
girls
two
women
with
orange
baskets
a
sailor
carrying
a
little
boy
and
a
stout
old
padre
who
apologized
prettily
for
pushing
we
did
those
folks
from
the
hotel
royal
chuckled
delia
sitting
on
irene
knee
for
lack
of
further
accommodation
did
you
ever
see
a
tram
fill
up
quicker
i
afraid
i
heavy
i
know
i
an
awful
lump
take
it
in
turns
and
i
nurse
you
after
a
while
i
call
this
rather
priceless
everybody
even
if
they
do
hustle
they
seem
to
mind
people
treading
on
their
toes
it
infectious
i
catch
myself
smiling
and
i
jolly
well
frown
as
a
rule
if
any
one
yanked
a
basket
into
my
back
i
think
it
the
climate
remarked
irene
in
a
london
tram
most
faces
do
look
too
cheerful
but
with
this
sky
overhead
people
are
simply
chirping
like
crickets
it
like
a
perpetual
summer
holiday
the
car
was
rattling
along
the
steep
coast
road
through
miles
of
glorious
scenery
on
the
left
was
an
ultramarine
sea
with
boats
and
to
the
right
lay
cliffs
and
olive
groves
some
of
the
trees
were
covered
with
catkins
and
others
had
already
burst
into
green
leaf
gorgeous
yellow
genistas
clothed
the
hillsides
and
the
banks
were
dappled
with
blue
borage
and
marigolds
there
were
so
many
things
to
look
at
from
either
window
of
the
tram
goats
were
feeding
along
the
crags
and
a
gray
businesslike
was
wending
its
way
across
the
harbor
in
the
direction
of
naples
they
passed
through
several
small
towns
or
villages
getting
a
vivid
impression
of
the
lives
of
the
inhabitants
who
on
sunny
days
seemed
to
do
much
of
their
domestic
work
out
of
doors
and
to
peel
potatoes
wash
salads
cook
on
charcoal
braziers
sew
mend
shoes
make
lace
and
pursue
many
other
vocations
on
the
pavements
in
front
of
the
houses
and
so
far
from
being
disturbed
by
onlookers
would
smile
and
even
wave
friendly
hands
at
the
strangers
on
the
tramcar
that
darling
old
soul
in
the
green
apron
blew
me
a
kiss
chuckled
delia
she
looks
as
happy
as
a
queen
though
she
probably
living
on
about
ten
cents
a
day
did
you
see
them
dressing
the
baby
on
the
pavement
squealed
stella
they
were
winding
it
round
and
round
in
yards
of
bandages
like
old
italian
pictures
i
did
know
it
was
done
nowadays
oh
look
at
the
carts
drawn
by
bullocks
and
the
lamb
with
its
fleece
all
combed
out
and
tied
with
blue
ribbons
that
because
it
do
you
see
the
baby
donkey
there
quick
in
her
efforts
to
watch
everything
at
once
delia
craned
her
neck
through
the
window
of
the
car
and
away
went
her
school
hat
sailing
over
a
bridge
and
down
into
a
deep
ravine
below
lost
forever
so
far
as
she
was
concerned
as
the
tram
certainly
would
not
stop
and
wait
while
she
searched
for
it
you
come
down
a
peg
in
life
old
sport
that
all
laughed
carrie
in
italy
wearing
a
hat
is
a
sign
of
gentility
no
ever
has
one
on
her
head
even
on
sundays
i
offered
a
of
mine
to
the
at
a
hotel
once
and
she
eyed
it
longingly
but
said
she
dare
wear
it
if
she
took
it
her
friends
would
think
it
such
swank
what
do
they
have
on
in
church
then
asked
delia
handkerchiefs
of
course
every
neapolitan
has
one
handy
to
slip
round
her
head
at
the
church
door
it
must
save
millinery
bills
and
they
all
have
the
most
beautiful
hair
hello
here
we
are
at
the
terminus
what
a
crowd
of
beggars
they
look
like
brigands
waiting
to
pounce
on
us
help
once
out
of
the
shelter
of
the
tramcar
the
girls
made
the
unpleasant
discovery
that
in
italy
begging
is
not
forbidden
but
quite
a
recognized
profession
with
certain
of
the
poorer
classes
they
were
immediately
surrounded
by
a
ragged
rabble
some
of
whom
exhibited
sores
or
other
unsightly
afflictions
to
compel
compassion
and
all
of
whom
held
out
dirty
hands
and
persistently
clamored
for
money
the
blind
the
halt
and
the
maimed
were
there
evidently
regarding
tourists
as
their
legitimate
prey
and
bent
upon
claiming
all
the
charity
they
could
get
do
give
them
anything
commanded
miss
morley
anxiously
keeping
her
little
flock
in
tow
and
shepherding
them
towards
the
piazza
where
the
carriages
could
be
hired
just
say
and
shake
your
heads
hold
a
safe
hand
on
your
purses
and
stick
together
do
get
separated
on
any
account
with
considerable
difficulty
they
forced
their
way
across
the
square
and
thankfully
took
refuge
in
several
waiting
landaus
whose
drivers
feeling
sure
of
their
patronage
promptly
raised
their
terms
high
above
the
ordinary
tariff
it
was
only
after
much
bargaining
on
the
part
of
miss
morley
that
they
consented
to
fix
a
reasonable
sum
for
the
excursion
to
pompeii
miss
morley
talks
italian
like
a
native
so
they
ca
her
rejoiced
stella
proudly
are
they
the
absolute
limit
no
i
want
to
buy
a
comb
or
corals
or
brooches
or
or
anything
they
seem
to
think
we
made
of
money
why
ca
they
let
us
alone
there
thank
goodness
we
off
at
last
and
can
leave
the
whole
persuasive
crew
of
them
behind
us
the
drive
from
castellamare
was
part
of
the
fun
of
the
excursion
but
pompeii
was
of
course
the
main
object
and
there
was
much
excitement
when
they
at
last
drew
up
at
the
great
iron
gate
miss
morley
bought
tickets
for
the
party
and
they
were
assigned
a
guide
a
smiling
italian
of
superlative
politeness
bearing
a
badge
with
the
number
upon
it
i
asked
for
one
who
could
speak
english
but
they
all
out
with
other
visitors
explained
miss
morley
never
mind
it
a
good
opportunity
of
testing
your
italian
and
i
can
interpret
if
you
do
understand
in
spite
of
the
which
they
had
previously
been
shown
the
girls
had
come
with
varying
expectations
of
what
they
were
to
see
some
imagined
they
would
walk
into
a
roman
city
exactly
as
it
stood
when
buried
by
the
ashes
of
the
great
eruption
of
others
thought
there
would
be
a
few
interesting
things
peeping
up
here
and
there
amid
mounds
of
cinders
none
had
imagined
it
would
be
so
large
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
remains
are
simply
the
bare
ruins
of
a
town
destroyed
by
burning
ashes
which
have
been
extricated
from
the
rubbish
accumulated
during
more
than
seventeen
centuries
the
paved
streets
and
the
roofless
and
broken
walls
of
the
houses
still
remain
with
here
and
there
some
building
that
by
a
fortunate
chance
escaped
either
in
whole
or
in
part
the
general
catastrophe
and
suffice
to
show
the
general
style
and
beauty
of
the
architecture
of
the
first
century
the
guide
marshaled
his
party
along
pointing
out
to
them
the
various
objects
of
interest
that
had
been
excavated
the
beautiful
marble
the
marble
counters
of
the
shops
identical
with
those
still
used
in
southern
italy
the
wine
jars
of
red
earthenware
the
for
grinding
corn
the
brick
ovens
or
the
vaults
where
wine
had
been
stored
they
went
into
the
site
of
the
ancient
market
and
the
forum
and
several
temples
and
walked
up
long
flights
of
steps
and
admired
rows
of
broken
columns
and
saw
the
public
with
their
tasteful
wall
decorations
and
the
niches
where
the
bathers
had
placed
their
clothes
and
they
admired
the
and
marveled
at
the
great
theater
that
had
been
wont
to
hold
five
thousand
spectators
the
general
impression
was
one
of
utter
desolation
the
mighty
ruins
lay
in
the
bright
italian
sunshine
and
close
above
vesuvius
frowned
over
the
scene
as
if
still
watching
the
result
of
his
deadly
handiwork
who
had
lived
in
those
blackened
houses
and
walked
in
those
streets
it
was
difficult
to
imagine
the
busy
thronging
crowds
that
once
must
have
peopled
all
these
silent
haunts
where
the
only
signs
of
life
were
the
little
green
lizards
that
darted
over
the
crumbling
walls
certain
of
the
best
houses
were
railed
round
and
kept
carefully
locked
and
inside
these
could
be
seen
what
was
left
of
the
domestic
life
of
civilized
pompeii
the
girls
enjoyed
looking
at
the
rooms
in
the
casa
dei
vettii
with
the
exquisite
paintings
of
cupids
still
left
upon
the
scarlet
walls
they
laughed
at
the
quaint
mosaic
of
the
chained
dog
with
its
warning
beware
of
the
dog
and
they
went
into
ecstasies
over
the
lovely
little
statue
of
the
dancing
faun
and
some
terracottas
of
venus
and
mercury
one
link
with
the
past
was
left
in
the
fact
that
a
few
of
the
houses
still
preserved
the
names
and
even
the
of
their
former
owners
my
does
he
look
boss
of
the
place
still
i
wonder
if
i
ought
to
leave
my
visiting
card
for
him
declared
delia
staring
at
the
green
marble
representation

by

the
others
laughed
they
had
all
been
feeling
rather
oppressed
and
were
glad
to
break
the
ice
i
so
tired
i
should
think
we
must
have
walked
miles
groaned
lorna
and
i
on
the
point
of
famishing
protested
irene
slapping
her
with
a
resounding
smack
miss
morley
turned
round
at
the
sound
and
possibly
caught
the
remark
for
she
spoke
hastily
to
the
guide
then
suggested
that
the
girls
should
sit
in
a
row
on
a
fallen
column
and
consume
their
provisions
you
all
need
a
rest
and
something
to
eat
now
then
we
go
on
with
our
sightseeing
and
have
tea
at
the
restaurant
when
we
finished
she
decreed
never
were
ham
sandwiches
and
oranges
so
acceptable
viewing
ruins
may
be
extremely
interesting
but
it
is
a
highly
fatiguing
occupation
and
delia
at
least
had
reached
the
stage
of
the
camel
i
guess
i
do
like
anything
it
too
depressing
give
me
paris
she
declared
tragically
cheer
up
old
sport
consoled
irene
i
going
to
take
a
of
some
of
us
when
the
guide
is
looking
you
shall
be
in
it
like
to
send
some
prints
to
your
friends
in
america
would
you
rather
they
burst
with
envy
to
see
me
photographed
inside
pompeii
where
are
you
going
to
take
us
i
finished
my
lunch
let
get
busy
quick
before
the
guide
comes
round
the
corner
delia
was
prancing
with
eagerness
she
flitted
about
like
a
butterfly
bent
on
choosing
the
best
position
for
the
desired
blanche
mabel
and
elsie
came
hurrying
up
anxious
to
join
the
group
and
fixed
themselves
in
elegant
poses
oh
i
ca
put
in
such
a
crowd
objected
irene
you
block
out
the
whole
of
the
view
i
only
want
delia
and
lorna
and
yes
i
have
désirée
but
nobody
else
please
clear
out
of
the
way
well
really
you
mean
thing
we
do
want
to
be
in
your
old
photo
irene
had
felt
cross
and
was
possibly
impolite
but
she
was
not
prepared
for
the
nemesis
that
descended
upon
her
head
she
had
just
congratulated
herself
that
blanche
mabel
and
elsie
had
beaten
a
retreat
and
that
she
had
been
able
to
take
her
so
successfully
when
who
should
make
his
unwelcome
appearance
but
the
guide
catching
her
in
the
very
act
of
winding
on
her
film
he
sighed
sorrowfully
and
spread
out
his
hands
with
a
dramatic
italian
gesture
signorina
non
e
permesso
he
objected
illustration
it
is
not
permitted
page
i
awfully
sorry
i
wo
do
it
again
really
murmured
irene
cramming
the
little
camera
back
into
her
pocket
but
this
apology
did
not
content
no
he
very
courteously
but
quite
firmly
insisted
upon
temporarily
confiscating
the
prohibited
article
miss
morley
who
hurried
up
at
the
sound
of
the
altercation
took
the
side
of
the
authorities
who
brought
a
camera
you
knew
it
was
not
allowed
yes
you
must
let
the
guide
have
it
he
give
it
back
to
you
at
the
gate
i
hope
there
wo
be
any
trouble
about
it
i
believe
you
can
be
fined
it
was
very
naughty
of
you
to
do
such
a
thing
much
crestfallen
irene
retired
into
the
rear
of
the
party
and
bewailed
the
fate
of
her
it
was
hard
luck
the
guide
should
pop
round
the
corner
that
exact
minute
she
groaned
mabel
fetched
him
squeaked
désirée
i
could
see
over
the
railing
and
i
watched
her
go
she
was
mad
that
you
would
put
her
in
the
photo
what
a
sneaking
trick
to
play
she
the
girl
i
have
told
about
i
hope
no
wo
take
the
spool
out
of
the
camera
because
there
are
three
undeveloped
snaps
of
the
villa
camellia
on
it
and
i
shall
be
wild
if
i
lose
them
he
could
be
so
heartless
if
i
only
knew
italian
better
i
try
and
coax
him
the
guide
had
obligingly
waited
while
the
girls
ate
lunch
but
he
now
waxed
impatient
and
hurried
his
party
on
to
the
house
of
pansa
this
must
have
been
quite
a
palatial
residence
and
showed
such
perfect
examples
of
the
arrangement
of
the
various
rooms
in
a
roman
mansion
that
they
lingered
a
long
time
looking
at
the
the
the
peristyle
and
the
kitchen
with
its
curious
mosaics
of
snakes
now
though
it
was
all
very
interesting
it
was
certainly
tiring
and
some
of
the
girls
grew
weary
of
listening
to
the
guide
descriptions
in
italian
or
miss
morley
explanations
i
bored
stiff
confessed
delia
in
a
whisper
linking
on
to
arm
if
i
have
any
more
information
crammed
into
my
head
it
will
burst
i
know
quite
enough
about
ancient
customs
already
all
i
can
say
is
thankful
i
living
now
instead
of
then
renie
if
you
love
me
take
me
out
of
of
miss
morley
and
let
me
chatter
and
frivol
poor
old
sport
laughed
irene
let
slip
away
and
take
another
turn
round
the
garden
while
the
guide
finishes
haranguing
i
out
of
friends
with
him
since
he
stole
my
camera
he
does
deserve
anybody
to
listen
to
him
i
a
few
chocs
left
in
this
package
you
shall
have
some
to
cheer
you
up
they
modern
at
any
rate
you
mascot
murmured
delia
stella
says
i
a
goth
but
why
i
like
old
things
did
the
pompeians
take
their
schoolgirls
to
look
at
buried
greek
cities
or
were
they
satisfied
with
their
own
times
how
soon
do
you
think
we
shall
have
tea
these
chocs
have
saved
my
life
but
i
longing
for
bread
and
butter
and
buns
why
we
have
finished
lunch
very
long
i
ate
more
than
half
of
mine
in
the
carriage
so
i
had
much
left
hello
where
have
the
others
been
i
did
know
there
was
a
way
up
there
the
rest
of
the
party
were
clattering
down
a
flight
of
wooden
steps
with
many
expressions
of
admiration
for
what
they
had
seen
at
the
top
perfectly
beautiful
the
finest
view
of
all
purred
miss
morley
renie
and
delia
did
you
go
up
you
silly
girls
you
missed
a
treat
no
i
afraid
we
ca
wait
now
the
guide
is
anxious
to
take
us
on
we
have
seen
the
house
of
sallust
yet
or
the
street
of
tombs
i
want
to
ask
him
whether
they
been
doing
any
more
excavations
near
the
herculaneum
gate
miss
morley
deep
in
conversation
with
no
passed
on
in
the
full
belief
that
all
her
flock
were
following
behind
her
irene
and
delia
however
were
determined
to
have
just
one
peep
at
the
view
from
the
top
of
the
wall
so
both
made
a
dash
up
the
wooden
staircase
from
here
there
was
a
glorious
prospect
of
the
entire
city
with
its
arches
and
columns
and
broken
temples
its
cypress
trees
and
its
somber
background
of
smoking
mountain
they
could
see
exactly
the
way
they
had
come
from
the
entrance
and
could
tell
which
was
the
street
of
fortune
and
which
the
street
of
abundance
it
was
so
fascinating
that
they
lingered
rather
longer
than
they
intended
they
be
waiting
for
us
ventured
irene
at
last
oh
bother
so
they
will
exclaimed
delia
rushing
down
prepared
for
a
scolding
but
the
others
had
not
waited
they
had
all
simply
walked
on
and
the
custodian
had
locked
the
gate
behind
them
it
was
fast
closed
and
no
amount
of
shaking
would
move
it
we
shut
in
gasped
irene
where
the
porter
he
ought
to
be
somewhere
about
with
the
key
the
custodian
quite
oblivious
of
the
fact
that
anybody
had
been
left
inside
the
house
of
pansa
was
reading
a
newspaper
and
eating
bread
and
garlic
under
his
wooden
shed
farther
down
the
street
where
he
would
remain
till
the
next
guide
came
along
with
a
party
and
requested
admission
so
he
did
not
hear
though
the
girls
thumped
and
called
and
made
a
very
considerable
noise
they
were
both
horribly
frightened
shall
we
have
to
stay
here
all
night
i
be
scared
to
death
think
of
the
spooks
why
the
whole
place
must
be
simply
of
ghosts
after
sunset
could
we
jump
from
the
wall
i
wish
i
never
come
oh
i
hate
things
i
shall
have
fits
in
a
minute
fortunately
for
delia
nerves
they
were
not
kept
long
in
durance
vile
lorna
very
soon
discovered
the
loss
of
her
buddy
drew
miss
attention
to
the
matter
and
the
whole
party
hastened
back
to
look
for
them
the
custodian
was
fetched
from
his
wooden
shelter
and
unlocked
the
door
loudly
disclaiming
any
responsibility
on
his
part
and
blaming
the
guide
it
your
own
fault
scolded
miss
morley
you
really
keep
with
the
party
i
ca
have
any
of
you
wandering
off
alone
you
ca
expect
me
to
count
you
every
time
we
come
out
of
a
building
i
put
you
on
your
parole
not
to
get
separated
again
we
wo
indeed
we
do
like
being
lost
promised
the
delinquents
earnestly
everybody
including
the
principal
was
very
tired
by
this
time
and
not
altogether
sorry
when
the
guide
finished
his
tour
of
the
ruins
and
conducted
them
safely
back
again
to
the
entrance
it
glorious
but
you
want
days
to
see
it
in
instead
of
only
a
few
hours
sighed
phyllis
and
backs
and
legs
agreed
sybil
i
shall
enjoy
thinking
it
over
when
i
home
but
i
ready
to
drop
at
the
present
moment
what
about
my
camera
asked
irene
anxiously
the
guide
had
not
forgotten
it
he
produced
it
from
his
pocket
and
perhaps
in
consideration
of
the
tip
he
had
received
from
miss
morley
he
did
not
confiscate
the
spool
but
handed
it
over
intact
with
a
polite
gesture
and
a
cryptic
smile
grazie
molto
murmured
irene
which
meant
thanks
awfully
and
was
one
of
the
very
few
italian
phrases
which
she
knew
everybody
was
extremely
glad
to
adjourn
to
the
restaurant
where
tea
had
been
ordered
for
their
party
and
a
table
reserved
for
them
the
big
room
was
full
of
visitors
and
rather
noisy
a
band
of
musicians
in
the
center
rendered
neapolitan
songs
to
an
accompaniment
of
mandolins
and
guitars
and
occasionally
the
audience
joined
the
choruses
the
performance
was
not
of
the
highest
quality
but
it
was
tuneful
and
interesting
to
those
who
had
not
before
heard
the
of
southern
italy
after
tea
the
girls
made
a
rush
to
buy
and
other
mementoes
of
pompeii
which
were
on
sale
in
a
room
next
to
the
restaurant
and
would
have
spent
half
an
hour
over
their
purchases
had
not
miss
morley
collected
her
flock
and
insisted
on
a
homeward
start
poor
little
désirée
slept
all
the
way
back
in
the
tramcar
with
her
head
on
stella
shoulder
and
most
of
the
party
were
in
much
more
sober
spirits
than
when
they
had
started
all
felt
however
that
it
was
a
experience
i
adore
to
go
again
sometime
ventured
lorna
clasping
a
model
of
a
pompeian
lamp
which
her
chum
had
given
her
for
a
souvenir
so
would
i
agreed
irene
miss
morley
calls
this
of
our
education
and
i
think
it
a
very
sensible
way
of
teaching
things
i
hope
she
take
us
to
other
places
you
get
vesuvius
if
your
conduct
sheet
is
all
right
oh
lovely
i
rather
go
there
than
even
to
pompeii
the
same
this
child
chipped
in
delia
renie
i
guess
you
and
i
will
have
to
shake
ourselves
up
and
reform
for
a
week
or
two
we
were
in
miss
morley
black
book
and
if
we
do
take
care
we
shall
be
left
out
of
the
next
excursion
i
be
an
absolute
saint
promised
irene
you
see
me
sprouting
wings
i
going
to
draw
a
physical
map
of
the
world
and
mark
in
all
the
principal
volcanoes
and
then
show
it
to
miss
morley
she
think
it
so
brainy
of
me
and
be
so
glad
i
interested
in
the
subject
she
really
feel
i
ought
to
see
vesuvius
after
that
you
schemer
it
not
a
bad
idea
though
and
perhaps
i
do
the
same
though
i
hate
drawing
maps
hello
is
this
the
piazza
i
no
idea
got
back
to
fossato
so
soon
yes
it
been
a
day
but
i
feel
all
i
want
now
is
supper
and
bed
chapter
ix
reprisals
it
was
immediately
after
this
that
peachy
who
was
always
doing
imprudent
things
and
running
risks
went
a
little
too
far
and
caught
a
severe
chill
she
was
moved
into
the
sanatorium
a
room
at
the
top
of
the
house
and
spent
three
quite
happy
days
in
bed
reading
books
and
magazines
and
drinking
hot
lemonade
which
was
miss
rodgers
favorite
remedy
for
a
cold
when
she
was
certified
as
free
from
any
infection
a
few
of
her
special
chums
were
allowed
to
visit
her
she
petitioned
specially
for
jess
delia
and
irene
they
found
her
propped
up
with
pillows
and
looking
very
charming
in
a
pale
pink
and
her
hair
tied
back
with
a
broad
ribbon
thanks
very
much
i
sitting
up
and
taking
nourishment
she
grinned
in
reply
to
their
commiserations
i
going
to
have
some
more
fun
before
i
pop
off
joking
apart
i
had
the
time
of
my
life
here
been
blissful
just
reading
and
resting
with
a
big
jug
of
lemonade
at
my
elbow
we
been
talking
about
you
downstairs
did
your
ears
burn
asked
jess
not
more
than
usual
what
were
you
saying
about
poor
little
me
we
had
a
special
meeting
of
the
camellia
buds
and
passed
a
vote
of
sympathy
for
one
thing
i
suppose
i
ought
to
it
to
you
in
the
orthodox
fashion
highly
gratified
i
sure
chirped
peachy
how
do
i
return
thanks
please
i
ca
get
up
in
bed
and
bow
what
next
well
the
next
is
that
nobody
can
think
of
anything
original
for
the
transition
to
do
at
the
carnival
and
everybody
said
peachy
so
we
come
to
you
for
a
suggestion
whew
that
a
big
order
groaned
the
invalid
we
had
almost
every
kind
of
stunt
that
practically
possible
what
are
the
seniors
getting
up
this
time
something
musical
to
judge
from
the
practicing
we
hear
it
sounds
like
operetta
and
the
juniors
are
having
a
fairy
play
miss
morgan
is
teaching
them
what
we
want
is
something
utterly
and
entirely
different
exactly
agreed
peachy
taking
a
drink
of
lemonade
if
you
do
have
a
we
shall
have
to
descend
to
an
ordinary
concert
or
a
scene
from
shakespeare
or
a
and
those
have
been
done
simply
dozens
of
times
i
know
frowned
peachy
we
had
trial
scene
from
merchant
of
ourselves
last
carnival
we
could
give
the
same
stunt
again
oh
do
bother
me
let
me
think
how
can
i
get
ideas
when
you
all
talking
at
once
peachy
put
her
fingers
in
her
ears
and
buried
her
head
temporarily
in
the
pillow
from
which
she
appeared
to
draw
inspiration
for
in
a
few
moments
she
sprang
up
with
a
bounce
of
rapture
got
it
she
announced
cheerily
let
do
a
you
shall
all
be
dressed
up
as
toy
animals
and
be
wound
up
to
work
oh
i
see
ever
such
possibilities
the
seniors
never
had
at
any
rate
good
it
sounds
prime
what
a
mascot
you
are
do
breathe
a
word
outside
the
form
warned
peachy
i
plan
it
all
out
and
we
have
a
rehearsal
when
i
downstairs
again
i
guess
we
give
them
a
surprise
hand
me
my
somebody
and
a
pencil
i
want
to
get
busy
sketching
costumes
i
can
see
the
whole
thing
in
my
mind
eye
and
it
ought
to
be
great
every
year
in
the
month
of
march
the
pupils
at
the
villa
camellia
celebrated
a
carnival
of
their
own
it
coincided
with
a
local
festival
at
fossato
on
which
occasion
the
inhabitants
were
wont
to
make
merry
dressing
themselves
in
fantastic
costumes
parading
the
streets
and
letting
off
fireworks
originally
the
girls
had
been
taken
to
see
the
gay
doings
but
the
town
was
often
so
rough
that
miss
rodgers
had
decided
it
was
an
unsuitable
entertainment
for
young
ladies
and
to
prevent
disappointment
made
the
happy
suggestion
that
they
should
keep
the
festival
in
their
own
grounds
so
each
spring
the
three
divisions
of
the
school
vied
with
one
another
in
producing
some
fresh
surprise
and
had
a
very
interesting
and
amusing
afternoon
in
the
garden
or
gymnasium
and
were
too
busily
occupied
to
feel
any
regret
at
being
deprived
of
the
sight
of
what
was
going
on
in
fossato
canon
and
clark
and
a
few
of
miss
rodgers
and
miss
friends
who
lived
in
the
neighborhood
were
generally
invited
to
swell
the
audience
of
teachers
the
juniors
were
given
a
little
assistance
by
their
form
mistresses
but
the
seniors
and
the
transition
managed
their
own
affairs
now
it
was
a
most
unfortunate
circumstance
that
at
present
the
two
sororities
in
the
transition
were
in
direct
opposition
each
was
of
course
aware
of
the
other
existence
but
each
society
kept
its
own
secrets
the
camellia
buds
did
not
even
know
the
name
of
their
rival
though
they
could
guess
at
its
list
of
members
peachy
recovered
from
her
cold
came
downstairs
bubbling
over
with
plans
for
a
due
celebration
of
the
festival
she
submitted
them
gleefully
to
the
assembled
girls
after
french
class
much
to
her
surprise
about
half
of
the
form
demurred
we
going
to
do
something
of
our
own
announced
bertha
airily
we
do
want
your
stunt
of
our
own
what
mean
asked
peachy
her
gray
eyes
snapping
i
mean
what
i
say
some
of
us
have
arranged
a
little
private
performance
we
going
to
keep
it
to
ourselves
and
leave
out
the
rest
of
us
you
can
have
one
of
your
own
well
i
like
that
flamed
peachy
you
dividing
the
form
into
two
stunts
we
never
done
that
before
besides
who
sent
up
a
message
asking
me
to
think
of
something
fresh
and
original
i
certainly
understood
it
was
from
of
you
peachy
in
huge
indignation
glared
into
several
conscious
and
guilty
faces
while
her
allies
backed
up
her
arguments
by
cries
of
shame
bertha
turned
rather
red
but
bluffed
the
matter
out
we
changed
our
minds
we
ca
always
do
everything
all
in
a
lump
as
i
said
before
we
got
our
own
stunt
and
you
camellia
buds
can
have
yours
camellia
buds
if
bertha
had
dropped
a
bomb
in
the
classroom
she
could
not
have
caused
greater
consternation
among
the
opposition
so
the
rival
society
knew
the
name
of
their
sorority
a
suppressed
arose
here
and
there
evidently
much
enjoying
their
confusion
bertha
and
her
confederates
retired
leaving
the
poor
camellia
buds
to
hold
an
indignation
meeting
everybody
talked
at
once
how
did
they
find
out
has
anybody
sneaked
it
the
absolute
limit
i
could
have
believed
it
it
gives
me
spasms
of
all
mean
things
it
makes
me
tingle
then
jess
who
was
practical
made
a
suggestion
i
vote
we
take
an
oath
of
every
member
that
she
has
betrayed
us
wise
young
judge
quoted
agnes
that
the
best
thing
said
yet
let
stand
round
in
a
row
and
swear
injun
if
the
camellia
buds
sustained
doubts
of
one
another
integrity
these
were
absolutely
dispelled
by
the
fervency
with
which
each
pleaded
her
innocence
somebody
must
have
been
eavesdropping
at
one
of
our
meetings
i
suppose
sighed
agnes
gloomily
it
horrid
to
think
they
know
our
secrets
and
we
do
know
theirs
i
give
worlds
to
get
even
where
do
they
meet
asked
delia
i
never
been
able
to
find
out
they
very
clever
in
hiding
themselves
yes
i
expect
they
keep
watch
and
scoot
whenever
they
see
one
of
us
that
it
of
course
said
irene
well
what
we
got
to
do
is
to
catch
them
off
their
guard
i
vote
we
get
the
kids
to
help
us
they
detest
bertha
and
mabel
they
just
adore
to
track
them
for
us
we
need
exactly
tell
them
why
good
for
you
renie
beverley
those
kids
will
do
a
turn
for
their
fairy
godmothers
we
call
another
candy
party
and
put
them
on
the
scout
i
a
box
of
peppermint
creams
that
will
just
go
round
one
apiece
ought
to
be
enough
for
them
the
juniors
were
fond
of
peppermints
and
even
a
limited
candy
party
was
in
their
opinion
better
than
none
at
all
they
had
never
received
sweets
of
any
description
from
bertha
or
mabel
indeed
they
regarded
them
as
the
idea
of
keeping
a
watch
over
their
movements
appealed
to
them
we
shadow
them
you
bet
grinned
little
jean
hammond
there
much
going
on
in
the
school
that
we
do
know
i
afraid
there
is
you
rather
imps
but
you
be
doing
a
good
deed
if
you
find
this
out
for
us
the
first
who
brings
news
shall
have
two
chocolates
the
camellia
buds
felt
no
more
compunction
in
employing
the
juniors
on
this
quest
than
a
government
that
organizes
a
secret
service
department
the
enemy
had
betrayed
them
shamelessly
and
deserved
reprisals
it
was
désirée
after
all
who
won
the
chocolates
she
haunted
house
and
garden
with
the
persistency
of
a
small
ghost
and
at
last
proudly
made
the
announcement
they
called
a
meeting
by
the
big
greek
jar
at
five
i
heard
ruth
tell
callie
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
that
was
exactly
the
question
which
puzzled
the
camellia
buds
it
was
one
thing
to
obtain
information
and
quite
another
to
act
upon
it
if
they
went
and
interrupted
the
rival
meeting
they
would
have
the
satisfaction
of
routing
the
enemy
but
would
be
none
the
wiser
it
was
peachy
diplomacy
that
pointed
out
a
way
the
greek
vase
she
said
meditatively
yes
it
enormously
big
and
i
think
i
can
manage
it
now
my
dearies
do
you
want
to
be
real
philanthropic
this
afternoon
and
give
up
your
turns
at
the
tennis
courts
to
other
folks
why
because
i
a
little
scheme
on
hand
i
want
to
keep
those
girls
well
away
from
the
lemon
pergola
until
it
time
for
their
precious
meeting
then
they
run
up
all
unsuspecting
poor
innocents
and
find
what
will
they
find
chiel
amang
them
takin
notes
chuckled
peachy
in
other
words
yours
truly
will
be
hiding
inside
the
big
jar
peachy
you
ca
ca
i
great
scott
do
you
think
i
going
to
let
this
beat
me
you
can
just
bet
your
last
nickel
i
shall
renie
and
jess
shall
help
to
hide
me
and
the
rest
of
you
must
watch
the
coast
clear
till
i
safely
inside
i
tell
you
i
crazy
to
try
it
it
be
the
frolic
of
my
life
there
was
certainly
no
plan
too
madcap
for
peachy
to
undertake
she
revelled
in
anything
venturesome
or
bizarre
the
camellia
buds
did
as
she
decreed
and
resigned
the
courts
that
afternoon
to
bertha
mabel
elsie
ruth
rosamonde
winnie
monica
and
callie
who
fell
readily
into
the
trap
prepared
for
them
leaving
this
double
set
busy
at
tennis
they
fled
to
the
opposite
end
of
the
garden
the
lemon
pergola
was
a
sheltered
walk
that
led
down
a
flight
of
marble
steps
to
a
small
fountain
there
was
a
shady
nook
here
with
bushes
of
bamboo
and
a
tree
with
a
sweet
flower
like
honeysuckle
and
little
red
roses
and
a
border
of
parma
violets
and
a
seat
made
of
bright
green
tiles
altogether
a
very
retired
and
pleasant
and
suitable
spot
in
which
to
hold
a
committee
meeting
exactly
behind
the
seat
stood
an
enormous
jar
of
colored
red
and
decorated
with
greek
figures
in
black
silhouette
rather
blurred
and
rubbed
off
but
still
distinguishable
no
doubt
its
original
use
had
been
to
store
water
wine
or
but
nowadays
it
was
merely
an
ornament
to
the
garden
a
plant
pot
full
of
scarlet
geraniums
rested
on
its
head
and
an
arbutula
twined
up
the
sides
peachy
climbed
up
the
bank
behind
and
with
the
help
of
jess
removed
the
pot
of
scarlet
geraniums
then
very
cautiously
and
carefully
she
let
herself
down
inside
the
jar
it
was
just
big
enough
to
contain
her
and
she
lay
concealed
like
one
of
the
forty
thieves
in
the
story
of
she
had
one
advantage
however
over
the
famous
brigands
there
was
a
little
round
hole
broken
in
the
front
of
the
jar
and
by
putting
her
eye
to
this
she
had
an
excellent
view
of
her
surroundings
are
you
all
right
asked
irene
anxiously
fixed
splendidly
thanks
stick
that
back
on
the
top
and
nobody
ever
guess
i
inside
now
scoot
quick
for
it
wo
do
for
them
to
see
you
haunting
round
the
place
must
look
absolutely
innocent
when
they
arrive
we
wo
go
too
far
shout
for
us
if
you
get
so
you
ca
bear
it
any
longer
said
jess
putting
the
geraniums
on
like
a
stopper
and
dragging
irene
away
peachy
position
was
certainly
not
one
of
comfort
squatting
at
the
bottom
of
the
great
jar
and
she
was
relieved
that
she
had
not
long
to
wait
before
the
rival
sorority
arrived
to
hold
its
meeting
the
girls
came
scurrying
flushed
after
their
games
of
tennis
and
flung
themselves
down
some
on
the
marble
steps
and
some
on
the
tiled
seat
bertha
as
the
camellia
buds
had
suspected
was
evidently
the
high
priestess
and
opened
the
ceremony
without
delay
members
of
the
starry
circle
she
began
hurriedly
repeat
your
oath
we
vow
to
be
loyal
to
one
another
and
to
our
president
and
never
to
reveal
the
secrets
of
our
society
recited
seven
voices
in
reply
aha
chuckled
peachy
to
herself
in
the
depths
of
the
gigantic
jar
got
the
name
of
your
precious
sorority
off
we
met
together
this
afternoon
continued
bertha
to
settle
finally
what
parts
we
going
to
take
at
the
carnival
ruth
just
look
round
please
and
be
none
of
those
wretched
camellia
buds
is
anywhere
about
bertha
paused
while
ruth
made
a
tour
among
the
bushes
and
seemed
slightly
puzzled
when
the
latter
reported
coast
clear
it
a
funny
thing
commented
the
president
but
i
declare
i
can
smell
that
particular
strong
scent
that
peachy
is
so
fond
of
i
suppose
it
only
fancy
i
can
smell
it
too
confirmed
elsie
sniffing
the
air
are
there
any
out
anywhere
near
asked
mabel
no
it
too
early
for
them
then
somebody
else
must
have
the
same
scent
or
have
picked
up
by
mistake
a
general
examination
of
handkerchiefs
followed
but
each
girl
disclaimed
all
responsibility
for
the
delicate
odor
queer
i
ca
understand
it
however
let
get
to
business
our
waxworks
are
absolutely
going
to
take
the
shine
out
of
their
stupid
old
the
only
trouble
is
how
we
going
to
get
hold
of
the
right
costumes
there
queen
elizabeth
now
i
can
manage
her
skirt
but
i
want
something
for
her
farthingale
what
can
we
raise
peachy
has
a
lovely
flowered
silk
remarked
mabel
it
would
be
just
the
thing
suppose
she
uses
it
herself
though
i
wo
give
her
a
chance
i
take
it
out
of
her
cubicle
the
night
before
and
hide
it
you
will
will
you
exploded
a
voice
from
the
interior
of
the
greek
jar
we
just
see
about
that
the
fact
was
that
peachy
crouching
position
had
grown
intolerable
she
was
bound
to
move
and
reveal
herself
and
her
indignation
at
cool
suggestion
flamed
forth
through
the
the
circle
sprang
up
in
much
alarm
and
some
of
them
squealed
as
the
pot
of
geraniums
fell
with
a
crash
from
the
top
of
the
big
jar
and
pink
face
and
fluffy
hair
appeared
instead
her
flashing
gray
eyes
certainly
held
no
love
light
in
them
you
mean
things
raged
peachy
call
yourselves
stars
do
you
i
see
anything
very
about
you
have
your
old
waxworks
if
you
like
but
i
can
tell
you
beforehand
you
wo
take
the
shine
out
of
you
copied
my
idea
shamelessly
and
if
you
going
to
steal
our
properties
too
yes
you
may
well
scoot
do
ever
dare
to
show
your
faces
to
me
again
for
the
members
of
the
starry
circle
had
broken
up
their
meeting
and
were
running
away
down
the
lemon
pergola
in
the
direction
of
the
house
immensely
upset
to
find
there
had
been
a
secret
listener
in
their
midst
once
they
were
out
of
sight
peachy
cooeed
for
jess
and
irene
who
appeared
bursting
with
laughter
and
demanding
details
having
witnessed
the
rout
of
the
enemy
from
a
distance
i
tell
you
presently
if
you
help
me
climb
out
of
this
wretched
thing
said
peachy
who
found
it
a
far
more
difficult
matter
to
extricate
herself
from
the
jar
than
it
had
been
to
drop
into
it
i
going
to
manage
oh
do
pull
my
arms
so
you
hurt
it
was
indeed
somewhat
of
a
problem
and
peachy
was
beginning
to
feel
seriously
alarmed
when
fortunately
one
of
the
gardeners
came
to
the
rescue
and
tilted
the
jar
over
so
as
to
allow
her
to
crawl
out
i
feel
like
a
released
slave
of
the
lamp
or
a
freed
dryad
or
something
or
mythological
she
declared
it
was
worth
it
though
to
see
those
girls
faces
thank
you
giovanni
i
ever
so
much
obliged
sorry
if
i
spoilt
your
bed
of
violets
is
that
delia
calling
us
coming
dearie
where
are
the
rest
of
the
camellia
buds
i
may
as
well
tell
my
story
to
the
whole
bunch
of
you
together
then
you
see
the
sort
of
thing
we
up
against
they
taken
our
idea
and
trying
to
beat
us
on
our
own
ground
that
what
it
all
about
chapter
x
the
school
carnival
the
camellia
buds
considered
that
they
possessed
a
real
grievance
the
difference
between
an
animated
and
waxworks
was
so
slight
as
to
be
immaterial
in
both
the
figures
would
require
to
be
wound
up
after
which
they
would
perform
various
antics
the
idea
had
certainly
originated
with
peachy
and
the
starry
circle
had
merely
copied
it
their
stunt
was
in
fact
a
shameless
plagiarism
why
could
they
have
joined
with
us
and
we
have
done
the
all
together
demanded
agnes
crossly
oh
i
do
know
it
just
their
perversity
it
look
so
stupid
to
have
two
separate
shows
whichever
comes
last
will
seem
so
stale
after
the
other
why
of
course
ours
will
come
first
it
there
be
a
fight
for
it
we
ca
squabble
at
the
carnival
with
miss
rodgers
and
miss
morley
looking
on
we
better
have
our
battle
beforehand
and
get
it
over
tell
the
stars
we
mean
to
have
first
innings
they
never
agree
look
here
it
no
use
coming
to
open
war
with
them
i
vote
we
try
diplomacy
has
anybody
thought
of
the
programs
yet
i
heard
the
seniors
groaning
over
having
to
paint
covers
for
them
well
let
go
to
them
privately
and
volunteer
to
help
then
we
shall
have
the
opportunity
of
telling
them
that
the
transition
stunt
is
to
be
in
two
divisions
and
that
part
i
will
be
taken
by
ourselves
quite
a
renie
i
beginning
to
admire
you
peachy
can
paint
beautifully
so
can
joan
and
esther
shall
i
go
and
say
we
offer
to
do
six
programs
come
with
me
peachy
you
our
champion
wheedler
the
two
delegates
started
at
once
on
their
diplomatic
mission
they
felt
indeed
that
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
they
found
several
of
the
prefects
collected
in
rachel
bedroom
where
possibly
they
were
having
a
little
private
candy
party
for
there
were
sounds
of
a
rustling
of
paper
and
a
shutting
of
drawers
before
they
were
granted
permission
to
enter
the
precincts
the
transition
girls
always
envied
the
rooms
these
were
on
the
seaward
side
of
the
house
and
their
balcony
had
glorious
views
over
the
bay
and
the
surrounding
coast
the
decorations
were
very
tasteful
the
walls
were
gray
with
a
stenciled
frieze
of
hydrangeas
and
there
were
indian
rugs
on
the
polished
wood
floor
rachel
and
her
roommates
had
provided
their
own
luxuries
in
the
way
of
pretty
cushions
pictures
and
and
the
general
effect
was
of
harmonious
comfort
well
what
can
i
do
for
you
inquired
the
head
girl
briefly
as
stella
admitted
the
diplomats
it
was
not
a
very
encouraging
reception
possibly
the
prefects
were
annoyed
at
being
disturbed
in
the
midst
of
what
they
were
doing
peachy
however
ignored
rachel
tone
and
putting
on
her
most
winning
smile
inquired
we
wonder
if
you
painting
any
program
covers
for
the
carnival
rachel
lolled
back
in
her
chair
and
retied
the
bow
that
terminated
her
long
dark
pigtail
perhaps
we
are
and
perhaps
we
are
was
her
somewhat
cryptic
reply
the
matter
in
our
hands
entirely
of
course
cooed
sybil
rocking
to
and
fro
on
a
cane
i
know
put
in
irene
trying
to
be
tactful
we
only
thought
that
perhaps
you
might
care
to
have
a
little
help
some
of
us
would
be
ready
to
paint
a
few
if
you
like
this
put
a
different
complexion
on
the
case
the
seniors
always
bristling
for
their
privileges
resented
idle
curiosity
on
the
part
of
the
transition
but
an
offer
of
help
was
another
matter
there
certainly
is
a
great
number
to
be
done
said
erica
with
a
beseeching
look
at
rachel
the
head
girl
thawed
a
little
well
we
should
mind
your
taking
a
few
off
our
hands
she
conceded
half
a
dozen
sybil
will
you
get
those
programs
out
of
my
drawer
put
anything
you
like
on
them
flowers
birds
figures
or
landscapes
lend
you
this
to
copy
the
printing
from
let
me
have
them
by
thursday
if
you
can
rachel
glanced
meaningly
at
the
door
as
if
she
considered
the
interview
might
now
with
decency
come
to
an
end
neither
peachy
nor
irene
took
the
hint
however
the
main
object
of
their
mission
had
not
yet
been
broached
you
not
written
the
program
inside
yet
commented
peachy
opening
one
of
the
covers
we
do
that
later
shall
we
copy
some
for
you
oh
no
thanks
then
irene
growing
desperate
blurted
out
what
they
had
really
come
to
say
the
transition
stunt
is
to
be
in
two
parts
this
time
bertha
and
mabel
are
arranging
one
and
peachy
is
getting
up
another
do
you
mind
putting
ours
down
to
come
first
sorry
but
i
afraid
it
ca
be
done
yawned
rachel
bertha
has
been
up
and
bagged
first
innings
i
wrote
it
down
did
i
stella
where
that
list
yes
here
we
are
the
juniors
are
to
come
first
because
miss
morgan
has
trained
them
and
she
thinks
they
get
the
fidgets
if
they
wait
and
it
better
to
have
their
performance
over
then
of
course
comes
our
stunt
and
then
the
transition
could
we
possibly
have
our
half
of
the
transition
stunt
before
yours
it
would
make
more
variety
most
certainly
not
rachel
brow
was
puckered
in
a
frown
and
sybil
from
the
depths
of
the
murmured
cheek
we
got
the
program
all
fixed
up
and
we
not
going
to
change
it
for
anybody
chirped
erica
any
one
who
is
satisfied
need
act
endorsed
rachel
with
such
a
very
decided
glance
at
the
door
that
the
two
delegates
could
no
longer
obtrude
their
presence
and
were
obliged
to
beat
an
unwilling
retreat
they
walked
along
the
passage
very
dissatisfied
with
the
result
of
their
mission
we
got
all
the
fag
of
painting
these
wretched
programs
and
gained
nothing
at
all
groused
irene
they
might
have
told
us
first
about
bertha
is
she
an
absolute
jacob
supplanting
us
like
this
those
seniors
are
unsympathetic
i
want
to
go
back
and
tell
rachel
what
i
think
of
her
she
only
say
foreign
if
you
got
excited
and
it
would
be
an
atom
of
use
either
they
taken
the
best
place
in
the
program
for
their
stunt
trust
the
prefects
to
do
that
what
to
be
done
about
it
it
will
need
some
thinking
over
peachy
agile
brains
were
rarely
to
be
beaten
she
slept
upon
the
problem
and
informed
her
friends
afterwards
that
inspiration
came
to
her
at
exactly
i
know
because
i
heard
the
convent
clock
strike
i
sat
up
in
bed
and
laughed
i
wonder
i
did
wake
the
dormitory
but
nobody
stirred
a
finger
listen
and
i
explain
the
situation
at
present
is
this
bertha
and
her
starry
circle
have
cribbaged
our
idea
and
forestalled
us
on
the
program
and
are
going
to
act
their
wretched
waxworks
first
and
are
congratulating
themselves
that
their
piece
will
take
the
shine
out
of
ours
so
it
will
i
afraid
the
audience
will
have
sat
through
the
play
the
seniors
stunt
and
the
waxworks
they
be
bored
stiff
to
see
our
straight
away
afterwards
well
they
see
it
that
my
idea
let
drop
the
and
do
something
quite
different
drop
our
we
do
it
some
other
time
but
you
see
we
one
advantage
on
the
program
at
any
rate
we
come
last
that
what
we
raving
against
i
know
but
if
you
think
of
it
it
a
great
opportunity
suppose
we
do
a
splendid
finishing
tableau
instead
of
animated
toys
it
would
make
a
magnificent
and
would
be
a
surprise
for
everybody
think
of
the
amazement
of
the
starry
circle
when
they
expecting
us
to
do
a
pale
copy
of
their
own
stunt
to
see
us
posed
as
a
tableau
and
everybody
clapping
the
roof
off
it
would
be
rather
sporty
only
i
did
so
want
to
dress
up
as
a
kangaroo
mourned
joan
dolefully
you
shall
be
australia
instead
and
you
look
far
nicer
guarantee
to
make
you
ever
so
pretty
it
to
be
an
pageant
to
symbolize
the
school
we
have
columbia
and
britannia
and
all
her
colonies
in
a
sort
of
you
see
it
will
please
miss
morley
and
miss
rodgers
no
end
that
starry
circle
will
be
just
with
envy
they
wish
they
been
in
it
it
will
absolutely
take
the
wind
out
of
their
sails
and
lay
them
flat
peachy
proctor
there
a
spice
of
genius
in
your
composition
said
jess
admiringly
i
could
never
have
thought
of
that
myself
oh
fiddlesticks
glad
you
approve
though
now
what
we
got
to
do
is
to
hustle
up
and
get
busy
over
costumes
they
take
some
contriving
hide
all
your
best
things
away
from
the
stars
or
they
be
commandeering
them
mabel
has
no
conscience
and
be
careful
that
not
the
least
hint
leaks
out
let
talk
openly
about
the
and
pretend
we
still
going
on
practicing
for
it
it
will
be
all
the
bigger
sell
for
them
when
they
find
out
the
camellia
buds
having
undertaken
to
paint
six
program
covers
nobly
did
their
duty
and
finished
them
in
the
prescribed
time
lorna
offered
to
take
them
to
rachel
room
and
met
with
quite
a
gracious
reception
from
the
head
girl
so
much
so
that
she
ventured
to
put
forward
a
suggestion
of
her
own
may
part
i
of
the
transition
stunt
have
a
time
limit
she
asked
we
want
to
have
some
idea
when
we
to
come
on
certainly
agreed
rachel
we
ca
let
part
i
go
on
i
had
thought
of
that
i
shall
tell
bertha
she
may
have
ten
minutes
and
no
longer
i
shall
ring
the
curtain
bell
if
she
exceeds
i
see
your
point
entirely
it
only
fair
i
was
afraid
if
it
was
getting
near
the
audience
might
want
to
stay
exactly
i
take
care
your
stunt
is
crowded
out
trust
that
to
me
i
not
head
girl
here
for
nothing
and
i
not
entirely
blind
either
my
advice
is
to
look
after
yourselves
lorna
returned
to
the
camellia
buds
feeling
she
had
considerably
scored
over
the
stars
her
previous
acquaintance
with
school
theatricals
had
taught
her
that
audiences
are
human
that
even
teachers
will
not
sit
through
too
lengthy
a
performance
and
that
the
lure
of
tea
can
not
be
resisted
by
those
who
are
accustomed
to
drink
it
daily
at
as
their
own
dormitory
was
half
in
possession
of
the
enemy
irene
and
lorna
adjourned
to
peachy
bedroom
to
make
preparations
for
their
costumes
and
held
cosy
in
company
with
delia
jess
mary
and
any
other
chums
who
were
able
to
join
them
they
kept
their
properties
safely
locked
up
inside
one
of
the
wardrobes
in
no
and
peachy
wore
the
key
tied
under
her
skirt
with
a
piece
of
ribbon
because
you
ca
trust
that
sneaking
mabel
not
to
come
in
and
poke
about
she
explained
grimly
i
know
she
wants
my
we
shall
have
to
gallop
with
our
costumes
if
we
to
make
anything
of
a
show
said
sheila
hastily
running
seams
in
a
creation
of
scarlet
and
blue
destined
to
clothe
canada
i
know
but
we
wear
them
even
if
they
got
raw
edges
and
are
fastened
together
with
pins
i
do
suppose
the
audience
will
be
near
enough
to
see
the
stitches
i
hope
not
at
any
rate
mine
are
absolute
cats
cradles
by
the
day
of
the
festival
however
the
camellia
buds
were
exactly
ready
they
had
kept
their
secret
strictly
and
flattered
themselves
that
their
rivals
the
stars
were
in
complete
ignorance
of
their
change
of
program
the
acting
was
to
be
in
the
gymnasium
not
in
the
garden
for
a
sirocco
wind
was
blowing
and
the
overcast
sky
promised
rain
it
was
a
pity
for
the
pergola
would
have
made
such
a
beautiful
background
and
some
enthusiasts
even
petitioned
miss
morley
to
keep
to
her
original
plan
and
have
you
all
wet
through
and
the
guests
shivering
with
cold
she
replied
no
indeed
be
thankful
we
have
such
a
large
room
as
the
gym
to
act
in
otherwise
the
fête
would
have
been
put
off
altogether
the
girls
were
allowed
however
to
decorate
the
platform
with
flowers
and
to
hang
up
chinese
lanterns
so
as
to
give
a
festive
appearance
to
the
scene
the
performers
donned
their
costumes
in
good
time
but
wore
waterproofs
over
them
to
conceal
them
they
wished
to
witness
each
other
stunts
yet
did
not
want
to
reveal
their
own
secrets
too
soon
there
was
quite
a
good
audience
assembled
in
the
gymnasium
miss
rodgers
and
miss
morley
had
sent
out
many
invitations
and
some
parents
and
friends
had
come
over
from
naples
to
combine
a
peep
at
the
celebrated
fossato
festival
with
a
visit
to
the
school
irene
cup
of
joy
was
full
when
to
her
utter
amazement
she
saw
her
own
father
mother
and
brother
walk
into
the
room
well
you
a
surprise
package
she
exclaimed
greeting
them
gleefully
why
did
you
write
and
tell
me
you
were
coming
we
did
know
ourselves
said
vincent
we
never
thought
we
could
manage
to
get
off
and
we
did
want
to
disappoint
you
when
does
your
stunt
come
on
not
till
the
end
so
i
can
sit
with
you
most
of
the
time
oh
simply
too
good
to
have
you
all
turn
up
like
this
mother
darling
there
a
chair
for
you
here
and
i
be
in
the
middle
between
you
and
daddy
the
entertainment
began
with
a
fairy
play
acted
by
the
juniors
they
looked
very
pretty
in
their
gauzy
garments
and
little
désirée
in
a
gossamer
robe
of
elfin
green
made
an
attractive
queen
so
dainty
and
ethereal
that
the
audience
almost
expected
to
see
through
her
what
a
sweet
child
was
the
general
comment
as
she
tripped
back
in
response
to
a
storm
of
clapping
to
give
an
encore
to
her
moonbeam
song
the
juniors
retired
having
covered
themselves
with
glory
greatly
to
the
satisfaction
of
miss
morgan
who
had
spent
much
time
in
training
them
for
their
performance
it
was
now
the
turn
of
the
seniors
they
had
got
up
an
operetta
of
robin
hood
and
appeared
clad
in
the
orthodox
foresters
costume
of
lincoln
green
with
bows
arrows
and
quivers
stella
as
maid
marian
and
phyllis
as
the
curtle
friar
were
especial
successes
while
will
scarlett
and
little
john
gave
a
noble
display
of
fencing
with
a
part
of
the
program
which
they
had
practiced
in
secrecy
under
the
instruction
of
the
gymnastic
mistress
and
now
presented
as
a
complete
surprise
to
the
school
their
acting
was
so
spirited
that
everybody
was
quite
sorry
when
the
short
piece
was
ended
and
would
have
liked
certain
scenes
repeated
had
not
miss
morley
pointed
to
her
watch
and
shaken
her
head
emphatically
to
forbid
further
encores
past
experience
had
warned
her
not
to
allow
one
section
of
the
school
to
monopolize
an
undue
share
of
the
time
to
the
exclusion
of
others
it
the
turn
of
the
transition
now
she
said
we
shall
only
just
work
through
our
program
by
half
past
four
even
the
camellia
buds
though
they
watched
with
jaundiced
eyes
could
not
deny
that
the
members
of
the
starry
circle
managed
their
waxworks
very
creditably
elsie
indeed
as
madame
de
pompadour
was
not
convincing
but
mabel
made
a
distinguished
sir
walter
raleigh
and
bertha
surpassed
herself
as
queen
elizabeth
the
rival
sorority
after
witnessing
this
triumph
was
more
and
more
thankful
to
have
abandoned
the
idea
of
acting
an
animated
it
would
certainly
have
seemed
tame
to
continue
on
the
same
lines
as
the
prior
performance
as
it
was
they
chuckled
with
satisfaction
behind
the
curtain
while
they
arranged
themselves
for
the
tableau
i
guess
it
will
make
them
sit
up
purred
peachy
setting
a
curl
straight
with
the
aid
of
her
it
will
be
frightfully
hard
to
keep
still
for
i
shall
just
want
to
stare
round
and
see
their
faces
but
do
alarm
yourselves
i
promise
not
to
give
so
much
as
a
blink
i
would
disgrace
our
stunt
for
the
world
i
be
a
rigid
marble
statue
till
the
curtain
drops
sh
sh
do
chatter
so
much
warned
jess
are
you
ready
yet
miss
morley
getting
impatient
it
nearly
half
past
four
and
i
expect
everybody
is
longing
for
tea
put
in
irene
they
have
to
wait
for
it
till
we
done
our
stunt
we
not
going
to
be
left
out
said
peachy
hurriedly
taking
her
pose
the
allegorical
scene
in
which
the
girls
were
grouped
presented
a
pretty
picture
as
the
curtain
rose
in
the
center
agnes
and
delia
dressed
as
britannia
and
columbia
supported
the
union
jack
and
the
stars
and
strips
together
with
a
bunch
of
camellias
as
a
delicate
compliment
to
the
school
jess
in
plaid
and
stood
for
her
native
scotland
peachy
with
fringed
leather
leggings
and
cowboy
hat
was
a
joan
in
a
somewhat
similar
costume
represented
the
bush
in
australia
sheila
in
a
white
coat
trimmed
plentifully
with
cotton
wool
made
a
pretty
canada
irene
was
an
irish
colleen
mary
with
bunches
of
mimosa
typified
south
africa
and
esther
gorgeous
in
oriental
drapery
and
numerous
necklaces
was
an
indian
princess
but
perhaps
the
most
successful
costume
of
all
was
lorna
she
had
been
chosen
to
take
the
character
of
new
zealand
and
was
dressed
in
a
pale
yellow
wrapper
decorated
with
beautiful
sprays
of
tinted
leaves
round
her
head
was
a
garland
of
orange
blossoms
and
in
her
arms
she
held
great
branches
of
oranges
and
lemons
to
typify
the
fruits
of
the
country
she
was
impersonating
with
lorna
dark
eyes
and
hair
the
effect
was
most
striking
she
kept
her
pose
admirably
scarcely
blinking
an
eyelid
though
mary
palpably
moved
and
even
joan
was
guilty
of
a
smile
the
audience
immensely
surprised
and
pleased
with
the
tableau
clapped
enthusiastically
it
was
felt
to
be
a
very
fitting
finish
to
the
festival
you
kept
your
secret
well
girls
said
miss
morley
as
she
congratulated
them
afterwards
i
sure
nobody
had
the
least
hint
it
was
charmingly
thought
out
and
arranged
come
along
now
and
have
some
tea
it
has
really
been
a
most
successful
afternoon
audience
and
performers
the
latter
in
all
the
glory
of
their
pretty
costumes
mingled
together
now
for
conversation
and
irene
quickly
joined
her
family
and
had
much
to
say
to
them
and
many
questions
to
ask
about
their
doings
in
naples
i
say
renie
whispered
vincent
suddenly
interrupting
her
tell
me
who
that
lovely
girl
she
looked
the
best
in
the
whole
of
your
tableau
irene
followed
his
glance
to
the
figure
handing

forward
much
against
her
will
to
be
introduced
stood
shy
and
blushing
but
her
heightened
color
and
evident
confusion
added
to
her
attraction
and
several
heads
were
turned
to
glance
at
her
among
the
guests
in
that
quarter
of
the
room
it
was
not
until
this
occasion
of
the
carnival
that
any
one
at
the
villa
camellia
had
recognized
lorna
as
a
budding
beauty

chapter
xi
up
vesuvius
on
a
certain
day
towards
the
end
of
march
miss
morley
who
usually
acted
as
cicerone
and
general
guide
arranged
to
take
a
select
little
party
up
vesuvius
irene
lorna
peachy
and
delia
were
among
the
favored
few
and
congratulated
themselves
exceedingly
it
is
certainly
not
an
occurrence
for
schoolgirls
to
view
a
volcano
and
this
particular
excursion
being
long
and
difficult
was
kept
as
a
special
treat
and
was
regarded
as
the
titbit
of
the
various
expeditions
from
the
villa
camellia
many
of
the
girls
had
of
course
made
it
on
former
occasions
but
to
those
whom
miss
morley
was
escorting
it
was
all
new
i
was
to
have
gone
last
autumn
confided
peachy
but
the
fact
is
i
got
into
a
little
fix
with
miss
rodgers
and
she
started
on
the
rampage
and
canceled
my
exeat
i
cried
till
i
was
simply
a
sopping
sponge
but
she
was
a
perfect
crab
that
day
lorna
were
you
to
have
gone
too
once
before
yes
and
got
toothache
just
like
my
luck
there
the
others
were
starting
off
and
i
was
sitting
by
the
stove
with
a
swollen
face
dabbing
on
belladonna
and
miss
rodgers
careering
round
telling
me
i
must
have
it
out
ugh
my
ailments
always
turn
up
when
i
going
anywhere
well
you
all
right
at
any
rate
consoled
delia
rather
unsympathetically
if
i
do
get
seasick
on
the
boat
oh
buck
up
you
must
we
throw
you
overboard
to
the
fishes
if
you
do
anything
so
silly
for
goodness
sake
do
any
one
start
symptoms
and
spoil
the
fun
where
miss
morley
i
just
aching
to
be
off
the
party
left
fossato
by
the
early
morning
steamer
and
went
straight
to
naples
they
drove
from
the
quay
to
the
station
then
took
the
little
local
train
for
vesuvius
italian
railways
generally
provide
scant
accommodation
for
the
number
of
passengers
so
there
ensued
a
wild
scramble
for
seats
and
it
was
only
by
the
help
of
the
conductor
whom
she
had
judiciously
tipped
that
miss
morley
managed
to
keep
her
flock
together
and
settle
them
in
one
of
the
small
saloon
carriages
here
they
were
wedged
pretty
tightly
among
native
italians
and
tourists
of
various
nations
including
some
voluble
swedes
and
a
company
of
dapper
japanese
gentlemen
who
were
seeing
europe
after
much
pushing
crowding
shouting
and
gesticulation
on
the
part
of
both
the
public
and
officials
the
train
at
last
started
and
pursued
its
jolting
and
jerky
way
it
ran
first
through
the
poorer
district
of
naples
where
dilapidated
houses
whose
faded
walls
showed
traces
of
former
gay
pink
blue
or
yellow
stood
in
the
midst
of
vegetable
gardens
then
the
slums
left
behind
the
line
passed
a
long
way
among
vineyards
and
orchards
of
almond
peach
and
cherry
that
were
just
bursting
into
glorious
lacy
blossom
the
railway
banks
were
gay
with
the
flowers
which
march
scatters
in
southern
italy
red
poppies
orange
marigolds
lupins
campanulas
purple
snapdragons
and
wild
mignonette
growing
anywhere
among
stones
and
rocks
with
the
luxuriance
that
in
northern
countries
is
reserved
for
june
at
torre
annunziata
the
party
from
the
villa
camellia
all
crowded
to
the
carriage
window
for
miss
morley
had
something
to
point
out
to
them
we
passing
over
the
lava
formed
by
the
great
eruption
in
the
whole
of
the
railway
line
and
ever
so
many
houses
were
buried
then
do
you
see
bits
of
them
peeping
out
over
there
why
yes
it
looks
like
cinders
commented
lorna
they
great
masses
of
crumbling
lava
turning
into
soil
wait
till
we
get
farther
on
then
you
see
lava
more
in
its
raw
stage
very
soon
we
shall
be
passing
over
the
top
of
herculaneum
the
ancient
city
lies
buried
thirty
feet
below
the
surface
are
they
ever
going
to
excavate
it
like
they
did
pompeii
the
trouble
is
that
the
modern
town
of
pugliano
is
built
over
the
top
and
naturally
the
owners
do
want
their
houses
pulled
down
whatever
treasures
in
the
way
of
greek
or
roman
antiquities
may
lie
buried
underneath
is
the
view
of
the
bay
of
naples
beautiful
from
here
yes
and
the
flowers
it
like
fairyland
at
pugliano
the
party
left
the
train
and
after
a
long
and
tiresome
wait
at
the
station
changed
to
the
light
electric
railway
that
was
to
take
them
up
vesuvius
the
little
carriage
resembled
a
tramcar
and
its
wide
glass
windows
afforded
excellent
views
of
the
scenery
up
up
up
they
went
gradually
getting
higher
and
higher
it
was
marvelous
how
the
vegetation
altered
as
they
ascended
the
cactuses
olives
almonds
and
peach
orchards
gave
way
to
hillsides
covered
with
small
chestnut
oak
or
poplar
trees
and
the
poppies
and
daisies
were
succeeded
by
broom
bushes
and
clumps
of
rosemary
they
were
getting
on
to
the
region
of
the
lava
and
all
the
ground
was
brown
like
newly
turned
peat
men
were
busy
digging
terraces
in
the
volcanic
earth
to
plant
vines
working
calmly
as
if
the
great
cone
above
them
had
never
belched
forth
fire
and
ashes
how
they
live
here
shuddered
peachy
pointing
to
the
tiny
dwellings
which
had
been
reared
here
and
there
when
they
see
all
the
ruin
round
them
are
they
afraid
what
makes
them
go
back
the
ground
is
so
rich
explained
miss
morley
nothing
grows
vines
so
splendidly
as
volcanic
earth
the
people
get
fatalistic
and
think
it
worth
risking
their
lives
to
have
these
fruitful
little
farms
they
say
the
mountain
may
not
be
angry
again
for
years
and
they
will
take
their
chance
it
smoking
now
said
lorna
i
suppose
it
safe
asked
delia
anxiously
perfectly
safe
or
we
should
have
been
allowed
to
go
up
in
the
electric
railway
do
you
see
that
big
building
the
observatory
careful
investigations
are
made
every
day
of
the
crater
and
the
results
telegraphed
down
to
naples
if
there
were
the
slightest
hint
of
danger
the
trains
would
be
stopped
and
tourists
turned
back
the
journey
was
ever
upwards
over
great
wastes
of
rough
brown
lava
which
looked
as
if
some
giant
in
play
had
squeezed
out
the
contents
of
enormous
tubes
of
oil
paint
on
to
the
mighty
palette
of
the
mountain
side
the
air
had
grown
fresh
and
cold
for
they
were
at
an
altitude
approaching
feet
and
but
for
the
scenery
might
have
imagined
themselves
in
wales
or
scotland
the
light
railway
ended
at
a
small
station
where
there
was
the
observatory
and
a
hotel
all
round
were
masses
of
enormous
cinders
and
above
a
grim
sight
towered
the
immense
cone
of
vesuvius
to
scale
the
tremendous
incline
to
the
summit
there
was
a
funicular
railway
to
which
our
party
now
transferred
themselves
sitting
on
seats
raised
one
above
another
as
in
the
gallery
of
a
theater
it
was
here
that
if
the
events
of
the
day
are
to
be
truly
chronicled
we
must
record
a
scrimmage
between
irene
and
her
chum
peachy
the
conductor
of
the
light
railway
had
gathered
a
bunch
of
rosemary
and
he
now
approached
the
funicular
and
bestowed
his
offering
upon
peachy
who
happened
to
be
sitting
nearest
to
the
end
she
was
immensely
gratified
at
the
attention
sniffed
the
fragrant
nosegay
and
handed
it
on
for
admiration
to
lorna
who
after
also
burying
her
nose
in
it
passed
it
to
irene
the
latter
ought
to
have
realized
it
was
not
her
own
property
but
unfortunately
did
she
calmly
appropriated
the
bunch
and
distributed
it
in
portions
to
those
nearest
her
peachy
cheeks
flamed
she
was
a
little
soul
underneath
her
gay
banter
well
of
all
cool
cheek
she
exploded
that
was
bouquet
it
was
given
to
not
to
you
renie
beverley
next
time
you
start
being
charitable
use
your
own
flowers
not
mine
you
have
left
me
a
single
piece
i
sorry
blushed
irene
trying
to
collect
some
portion
at
least
of
her
offerings
to
hand
back
to
the
lawful
owner
i
thought
they
were
given
to
me
no
you
did
you
simply
bagged
them
snapped
peachy
i
not
friends
with
you
so
do
talk
to
me
any
more
and
peachy
turned
a
red
offended
face
out
of
the
carriage
window
irene
might
have
apologized
further
but
the
funicular
gave
a
mighty
jerk
at
that
moment
and
the
carriage
started
up
up
went
the
little
train
working
on
wire
ropes
like
a
bucket
coming
out
of
a
well
higher
and
higher
and
higher
it
rose
up
the
terrific
incline
over
masses
of
cinders
towards
the
thick
cloud
of
smoke
that
loomed
above
it
stopped
at
last
at
a
big
iron
gate
which
opened
to
admit
the
passengers
on
to
the
summit
here
the
guides
were
waiting
and
after
some
parleying
in
italian
miss
morley
engaged
a
couple
of
them
to
escort
her
party
led
by
these
men
who
knew
every
inch
of
the
way
they
started
to
walk
to
the
crater
of
the
volcano
a
cinder
path
had
been
made
along
the
edge
of
the
cone
having
on
the
left
side
a
steep
ridge
of
ashes
and
on
the
right
a
sheer
drop
of
many
thousand
feet
from
this
strange
road
there
were
weird
and
beautiful
effects
for
it
was
above
the
region
of
the
clouds
which
floated
below
sometimes
hiding
the
landscape
and
sometimes
revealing
glorious
stretches
of
country
with
gleams
of
sunshine
falling
on
the
white
houses
of
towns
miles
below
and
blue
reaches
of
sea
with
mountains
beyond
great
volumes
of
smoke
kept
coming
down
from
the
summit
and
blowing
in
a
dense
cloud
then
clearing
for
a
few
minutes
and
forming
again
there
were
booming
sounds
like
the
firing
of
cannons
that
seemed
to
issue
from
the
smoke
very
much
awed
by
these
impressive
surroundings
the
party
kept
close
together
the
guides
in
their
gray
uniforms
and
caps
with
red
bands
were
a
comforting
feature
of
the
excursion
but
for
their
encouragement
the
girls
would
have
been
too
much
scared
to
proceed
delia
was
clinging
to
peachy
and
lorna
held
irene
arm
tightly
miss
morley
who
had
been
before
kept
assuring
everybody
that
there
was
no
danger
and
after
a
few
minutes
they
grew
sufficiently
accustomed
to
the
scene
to
thoroughly
enjoy
the
magnificent
effects
of
the
clouds
circling
below
them
but
the
guides
were
calling
haste
for
the
mist
was
clearing
and
it
would
be
possible
to
get
a
view
of
the
crater
they
all
scurried
along
the
path
and
suddenly
to
the
left
instead
of
the
high
ridge
of
cinders
they
could
look
down
into
a
deep
rocky
ravine
from
this
hollow
vapors
were
rising
as
from
a
witch
cauldron
but
every
now
and
then
the
wind
dispersed
them
as
if
lifting
a
veil
revealing
a
glimpse
of
the
crater
at
the
bottom
of
the
ravine
stood
a
great
cone
from
the
mouth
of
which
poured
dense
clouds
of
smoke
and
between
the
smoke
could
be
seen
fire
as
if
the
interior
of
the
cone
were
a
furnace
sometimes
the
vapors
were
shadowy
as
gray
phantoms
sometimes
glowing
red
with
the
reflection
of
the
fire
within
and
as
they
whirled
round
the
dim
ravine
loud
explosions
broke
the
silence
the
view
was
as
fleeting
and
evanescent
as
a
landscape
in
a
dream
one
minute
there
would
be
nothing
but
a
bank
of
mist
and
deadly
stillness
the
next
a
vision
of
fire
and
sounds
that
rent
the
mountain
air
it
like
looking
into
the
bottomless
pit
shivered
delia
oh
but
it
magnificent
gasped
peachy
i
no
idea
it
would
be
so
grand
as
this
said
irene
i
have
missed
it
for
worlds
come
along
girls
the
guides
can
take
us
farther
said
miss
morley
do
be
frightened
for
it
perfectly
safe
and
they
wo
let
us
go
into
any
danger
so
they
went
some
way
along
the
mountain
and
turned
down
a
side
path
towards
the
crater
it
was
difficult
walking
for
they
were
all
among
lava
and
sliding
cinders
but
the
guides
kept
close
by
them
and
helped
them
over
difficult
places
when
they
had
descended
perhaps
a
hundred
feet
or
so
the
ground
became
percolated
with
steam
jets
of
it
poured
from
holes
among
the
rocks
and
the
cinders
upon
which
they
stood
felt
warm
to
their
boots
the
guides
brought
the
party
to
a
halt
upon
a
ledge
of
volcanic
rock
from
below
which
ran
a
sheer
slide
of
hot
cinders
into
the
ravine
from
here
there
was
a
splendid
near
view
of
the
cone
its
top
yellow
with
sulphur
and
at
its
base
a
lake
of
molten
lava
one
of
the
guides
a
venturesome
fellow
climbed
down
by
another
path
and
fetched
lumps
of
sulphur
as
souvenirs
for
the
girls
and
the
other
guide
pressed
upon
them
pieces
of
lava
into
which
while
hot
he
had
inserted
coins
so
that
they
had
set
into
the
mass
when
cool
they
were
naturally
immensely
delighted
with
these
mementoes
and
put
them
in
their
pockets
quite
unsuspecting
of
the
sequel
that
was
to
ensue
it
was
a
fearful
scramble
back
up
the
steep
path
over
the
sliding
cinders
the
guides
held
out
a
stick
or
a
hand
to
help
at
awkward
corners
and
being
young
and
active
the
party
managed
to
scale
the
side
of
the
ravine
and
regain
the
summit
of
the
mountain
without
any
accidents
though
delia
confessed
afterwards
that
she
had
fully
expected
to
tumble
backwards
and
roll
into
the
lava
a
fear
which
miss
morley
entirely
there
was
no
danger
unless
you
fainted
and
the
guides
were
close
at
your
elbow
the
whole
time
she
declared
the
smiling
officials
in
the
gray
uniforms
and
caps
had
indeed
seemed
the
good
geniuses
of
the
excursion
but
alack
they
exhibited
a
different
aspect
when
they
had
conducted
their
party
back
to
the
entrance
of
the
funicular
railway
not
satisfied
with
the
payment
which
the
government
tariff
allowed
them
to
charge
they
demanded
from
each
of
the
visitors
exorbitant
tips
in
consideration
of
the
little
lumps
of
sulphur
and
lava
which
they
had
given
them
from
the
crater
the
girls
who
had
supposed
these
to
be
presents
were
most
indignant
five
francs
for
a
scrap
of
sulphur
and
we
just
called
him
such
a
kind
man
let
him
keep
his
wretched
souvenirs
no
no
i
want
mine
it
too
bad
i
want
my
money
to
buy
it
absolute
blackmail
the
guides
no
longer
smiling
and
obliging
but
clamoring
loudly
for
extra
money
were
finally
settled
with
by
miss
morley
who
knew
the
customs
of
the
country
and
was
aware
that
they
would
be
quite
content
with
less
than
half
of
what
they
had
asked
it
always
the
way
in
naples
she
said
philosophically
as
she
thankfully
bundled
her
flock
into
the
funicular
you
ca
get
along
anywhere
without
tipping
the
government
may
try
its
best
to
arrange
fixed
prices
but
every
one
who
goes
sightseeing
must
be
prepared
to
part
with
a
good
deal
in
the
way
of
small
change
the
guides
are
not
such
brigands
as
they
used
to
be
thank
goodness
thirty
or
forty
years
ago
i
suppose
it
was
hopeless
to
come
unless
you
brought
a
courier
with
you
from
naples
to
keep
the
others
off
well
you
have
your
little
souvenirs
of
vesuvius
at
any
rate
even
if
they
turned
out
rather
expensive
ones
they
something
to
keep
are
they
i
would
have
given
up
mine
if
they
asked
me
twenty
dollars
for
it
declared
peachy
fondling
the
nickel
coin
set
in
the
lump
of
lava
i
do
understand
the
neapolitans
frowned
irene
one
minute
so
charming
and
persuasive
and
winning
and
gay
and
the
next
absolute
bandits
they
a
mixed
race
with
a
good
deal
of
the
spaniard
in
them
explained
miss
morley
we
must
make
certain
allowances
for
their
southern
temperaments
and
customs
they
very
poor
and
they
look
upon
american
and
british
tourists
as
made
of
money
and
therefore
fair
game
to
be
fleeced
the
best
plan
is
to
take
them
quite
calmly
and
never
lose
your
temper
however
excited
they
may
get
when
you
lived
here
for
a
time
you
learn
how
to
treat
them
by
this
time
they
had
reached
the
bottom
of
the
funicular
and
were
back
in
the
little
station
near
the
observatory
a
picturesque
woman
with
a
yellow
shawl
round
her
shoulders
and
long
gold
earrings
in
her
ears
came
hurrying
up
to
sell
and
offered
to
show
the
party
the
quickest
way
into
the
hotel
as
every
one
was
very
tired
and
hungry
miss
morley
succumbed
to
the
voice
of
this
siren
and
permitted
her
to
escort
them
by
what
she
assured
them
would
be
a
short
cut
and
would
save
many
steps
but
alas
for
italian
veracity
their
suave
and
smiling
guide
led
them
down
a
path
at
the
back
of
the
hotel
to
a
shabby
and
dirty
little
restaurant
of
her
own
where
she
vehemently
assured
them
she
would
provide
them
with
a
far
cheaper
meal
an
offer
which
at
the
sight
of
the
crumby
they
resolutely
refused
the
old
humbug
i
no
idea
she
was
decoying
us
away
from
the
hotel
really
nobody
can
be
trusted
up
here
fumed
miss
morley
come
along
girls
i
told
the
conductor
to
reserve
a
table
for
us
and
there
be
time
to
have
lunch
before
the
train
starts
unless
we
quick
so
they
all
hurried
back
again
up
the
path
much
to
the
chagrin
of
the
siren
and
found
their
own
way
into
the
hotel
where
seats
had
been
kept
for
them
in
the
restaurant
and
dishes
of
macaroni
and
vegetables
and
cups
of
hot
coffee
were
in
readiness
the
great
attraction
to
the
girls
was
the
fact
that
if
they
bought
at
the
hotel
these
could
be
stamped
by
the
conductor
of
the
train
with
the
vesuvius
postmark
and
posted
in
a
special
at
the
station
the
idea
of
sending
cards
to
their
friends
actually
from
the
volcano
itself
was
most
fascinating
and
they
scribbled
away
till
the
last
available
moment
i
guess
some
homes
in
america
will
be
startled
when
they
see
these
purred
peachy
addressing
flaming
representations
of
an
eruption
it
ought
just
to
make
nell
condy
eyes
pop
out
i
only
afraid
they
wo
believe
we
really
been
sighed
delia
skeptically
they
have
to
with
the
vesuvius
postmark
the
ca
tell
fibs
at
any
rate
i
call
these
cards
a
bit
of
luck
be
a
sport
somebody
and
lend
me
an
extra
stamp
i
cleared
out
and
have
so
much
as
a
nickel
left
hurry
girls
or
we
sha
get
places
in
the
train
urged
miss
morley
sweeping
her
party
from
the
hotel
into
the
station
where
other
tourists
were
beginning
to
crowd
into
the
carriages
the
platform
was
a
characteristic
italian
scene
a
blind
man
with
a
guitar
was
singing
gay
neapolitan
songs
in
a
beautiful
tenor
voice
a
woman
with
a
lovely
baby
was
calling
oranges
an
old
man
with
a
red
cap
and
a
faded
blue
umbrella
under
his
arm
offered
specimens
of
lace
while
a
girl
tried
to
sell
cameos
carved
in
lava
throwing
them
on
to
the
laps
of
the
passengers
as
they
sat
in
the
train
irene
who
was
beginning
to
learn
italian
methods
of
purchase
commenced
to
bargain
with
her
for
a
quaintly
cut
mascot
reducing
the
price
asked
lira
by
lira
till
at
length
when
the
conductor
blew
his
brass
horn
she
finally
got
it
for
exactly
half
of
what
was
at
first
demanded
and
quite
enough
too
said
miss
morley
who
had
watched
the
business
with
amusement
she
probably
more
than
satisfied
and
will
go
dancing
home
to
her
mother
let
me
look
irene
this
funny
little
hunchback
is
always
considered
the
of
vesuvius
i
believe
he
copied
from
a
model
found
in
pompeii
he
the
true
mascot
of
the
mountain
yes
quite
a
pretty
little
curio
and
well
worth
having
i
wish
i
had
any
money
left
to
buy
one
with
sighed
peachy
the
train
was
speeding
downhill
now
leaving
ashes
and
lava
behind
and
heading
for
the
bright
bay
where
the
sun
was
shining
on
the
sea
seen
from
above
against
a
gray
background
of
olives
and
other
trees
not
yet
in
leaf
the
blossoming
peaches
and
apricots
had
a
filmy
fairy
look
most
beautiful
to
behold
behind
frowned
the
great
volcano
still
belching
out
clouds
of
smoke
i
a
different
impression
of
old
vesuvius
now
i
seen
his
heart
said
peachy
looking
back
for
a
last
farewell
view
he
still
seems
full
of
mischief
but
i
glad
he
played
no
tricks
while
we
were
up
there
commented
delia
it
certainly
one
of
the
sights
of
the
world
and
i
glad
i
seen
it
said
lorna
yes
i
do
mind
telling
you
i
was
scared
when
these
explosions
kept
popping
off
i
thought
it
was
going
to
erupt
and
give
us
the
benefit
irene
when
they
were
back
at
the
villa
camellia
patched
up
her
squabble
with
peachy
whom
she
had
offended
over
the
rosemary
incident
and
pressed
the
vesuvius
mascot
upon
her
as
a
peace
offering
i
did
mean
to
grab
your
flowers
she
assured
her
really
honest
injun
i
did
why
i
forgotten
all
about
it
declared
her
chum
i
did
mind
a
bit
after
my
mad
cooled
off
sorry
if
i
was
a
bear
no
i
wo
take
your
lucky
hunchback
i
well
you
a
dear
i
adore
to
have
it
i
felt
absolutely
green
when
i
saw
you
buy
it
i
hang
him
on
a
chain
and
wear
him
round
my
neck
and
i
expect
i
just
be
a
whiz
at
tennis
oh
is
he
funny
thanks
so
i
shall
keep
him
eternally
as
a
memory
of
this
ripping
day
up
old
vesuvius
chapter
xii
tar
and
feathers
after
the
decided
triumph
of
their
tableau
at
the
carnival
the
camellia
buds
held
up
their
heads
against
their
rivals
the
starry
circle
there
was
hot
competition
between
the
two
sororities
each
continually
trying
to
go
one
better
than
the
other
if
the
stars
held
a
surreptitious
candy
party
the
buds
at
the
risk
of
detection
by
rachel
or
some
other
prefect
gave
a
dormitory
stunt
throwing
out
hints
afterwards
of
the
fun
they
had
enjoyed
both
societies
produced
manuscript
magazines
which
were
read
in
strict
privacy
at
their
meetings
and
contained
pointed
allusions
to
their
enemies
failings
no
whigs
and
tories
could
have
preserved
a
keener
feud
the
division
between
them
waxing
so
serious
that
sometimes
they
could
hardly
sit
peaceably
side
by
side
in
class
it
all
mabel
declared
jess
of
course
we
had
two
sororities
before
she
came
but
we
were
at
daggers
drawn
like
this
mabel
has
spoiled
bertha
and
those
two
lead
everything
the
rest
are
simply
sheep
humph
pretty
black
sheep
i
should
call
them
snorted
peachy
they
siding
with
one
another
now
to
break
rules
i
do
mean
candy
parties
or
just
fun
of
that
kind
but
sneaking
things
they
cheating
abominably
over
their
exercises
and
cribbing
each
other
translations
wholesale
i
found
them
at
it
yesterday
and
told
them
what
i
thought
about
them
some
of
them
ought
to
know
better
rosamonde
and
monica
are
really
that
sort
they
by
bertha
and
mabel
i
lay
all
the
blame
on
them
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
the
stars
if
that
precious
pair
could
be
caught
tripping
and
taught
a
lesson
i
dare
say
it
would
but
it
not
an
easy
business
said
peachy
gloomily
mabel
hughes
is
an
extremely
slippery
young
person
and
she
generally
manages
to
keep
out
of
open
trouble
i
do
suppose
any
of
the
teachers
or
even
the
prefects
have
the
least
idea
what
really
like
and
we
ca
go
sneaking
and
tell
them
so
we
must
try
and
engineer
the
matter
for
ourselves
it
was
undoubtedly
true
that
with
the
advent
of
mabel
hughes
a
new
and
unpleasant
element
had
crept
into
the
transition
such
an
influence
is
often
very
subtle
girls
who
a
term
ago
would
not
have
condescended
to
any
form
of
cheating
accepted
a
lower
standard
of
honor
and
tried
to
excuse
themselves
on
the
ground
that
they
merely
did
the
same
as
others
the
fact
that
the
camellia
buds
did
not
share
in
the
dishonesty
was
set
down
to
priggishness
on
their
part
bertha
and
mabel
often
making
jokes
at
their
expense
one
day
an
unpleasant
matter
happened
in
the
school
it
was
the
fortnightly
examination
and
when
the
transition
took
their
places
at
their
desks
with
sheets
of
foolscap
and
lists
of
questions
it
was
found
that
the
inkwells
of
each
member
of
the
camellia
buds
had
been
stuffed
up
with
so
that
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
dip
their
pens
miss
bickford
who
did
not
even
know
of
the
existence
of
the
sororities
and
therefore
could
not
perceive
the
significance
of
the
fact
that
certain
girls
were
thus
served
while
others
went
free
flew
into
a
towering
rage
and
accused
peachy
whose
reputation
as
a
practical
joker
was
not
altogether
undeserved
of
having
played
the
shameless
joke
peachy
smarting
with
the
injustice
of
the
false
charge
forgot
herself
and
retorted
hotly
priscilla
proctor
thundered
miss
bickford
i
have
sometimes
excused
high
spirits
but
i
never
allow
impertinence
and
insubordination
leave
the
room
instantly
and
go
upstairs
to
the
sanatorium
you
remain
there
until
you
apologize
a
dead
hush
fell
over
the
class
as
peachy
with
flaming
eyes
and
chin
in
the
air
flounced
out
and
slammed
the
door
after
her
it
was
an
extreme
measure
at
the
villa
camellia
to
banish
a
girl
to
the
sanatorium
a
public
disgrace
generally
administered
only
by
one
of
the
principals
and
scarcely
ever
resorted
to
by
a
form
mistress
miss
bickford
with
a
red
spot
on
each
cheek
glared
at
the
row
of
faces
in
front
of
her
can
any
one
give
any
information
about
this
business
she
asked
then
as
nobody
replied
she
continued
i
disgusted
with
the
whole
set
of
you
i
wish
to
say
that
i
not
as
blind
as
you
seem
to
think
and
noticed
many
points
about
your
work
that
are
to
say
the
least
extremely
suspicious
i
tell
you
once
and
for
all
must
i
wo
have
cheating
practical
jokes
or
impertinence
in
this
form
do
you
all
thoroughly
understand
me
very
well
then
do
let
this
kind
of
thing
ever
happen
again
empty
those
out
on
to
that
tray
and
winnie
fetch
the
out
of
the
cupboard
and
refill
them
this
senseless
proceeding
has
wasted
a
large
part
of
your
examination
time
but
i
shall
make
no
excuse
for
it
your
papers
will
be
marked
as
if
you
had
begun
at
nine
with
miss
bickford
on
the
no
one
dared
to
say
a
single
word
but
at
interval
the
injured
camellia
buds
snatched
their
biscuits
and
fled
to
their
grotto
in
the
garden
to
hold
an
indignation
meeting
here
they
talked
fast
and
freely
it
a
jolly
shame
unfair
poor
old
peachy
who
did
it
why
mabel
of
course
or
bertha
one
or
other
of
them
miss
bickford
has
noticed
their
cheating
yes
and
puts
it
off
on
to
us
all
i
like
that
it
so
gloriously
fair
is
it
she
may
say
she
not
blind
but
she
an
absolute
cat
what
to
be
done
about
it
those
stars
wo
ever
tell
trust
them
to
screen
themselves
oh
it
bad
letting
off
steam
though
comforting
to
their
feelings
did
not
bring
them
any
nearer
to
a
solution
of
their
problem
the
unpleasant
fact
remained
that
the
rival
sorority
had
played
an
abominable
trick
and
that
the
blame
at
present
rested
upon
peachy
to
prove
her
innocence
required
the
wisdom
of
solomon
if
they
could
have
explained
the
whole
situation
to
miss
bickford
she
would
at
once
have
seen
for
herself
that
the
offender
must
be
among
the
ranks
of
the
stars
but
such
a
proceeding
would
mean
not
only
an
entire
breach
of
schoolgirl
etiquette
but
a
betrayal
of
their
own
secret
society
it
was
not
to
be
thought
of
for
a
moment
peachy
have
to
climb
down
and
apologize
decided
jess
peachy
eat
oh
well
she
certainly
was
cheeky
small
blame
to
her
it
was
very
silly
of
her
though
to
flare
out
she
in
the
fix
of
her
life
now
poor
dear
ca
we
do
anything
to
help
her
i
do
know
let
think
it
over
and
hold
another
meeting
this
afternoon
peachy
place
at
the
was
empty
that
day
and
her
meal
was
sent
up
to
the
sanatorium
upon
a
tray
miss
bickford
had
told
her
side
of
the
story
to
miss
rodgers
who
agreed
that
discipline
must
be
maintained
and
ordered
the
detention
of
the
prisoner
until
she
showed
symptoms
of
repentance
meanwhile
peachy
still
in
an
utterly
rebellious
frame
of
mind
stayed
upstairs
determined
not
to
give
way
it
was
dull
undoubtedly
to
be
banished
to
solitary
confinement
for
there
was
not
even
a
book
in
the
room
to
amuse
her
her
own
thoughts
were
her
sole
occupation
she
had
a
very
fertile
brain
however
and
suddenly
a
most
brilliant
suggestion
occurred
to
her
the
sanatorium
was
on
the
top
story
of
the
villa
camellia
and
by
peeping
from
its
window
she
could
command
a
view
of
the
iron
balcony
that
fronted
the
rooms
below
she
calculated
that
she
was
probably
exactly
above
dormitory
occupied
by
joan
esther
mary
and
agnes
and
that
these
chums
would
later
on
be
engaged
there
at
their
preparation
with
a
little
ingenuity
it
should
be
possible
to
communicate
with
them
she
unfortunately
had
neither
pencil
nor
paper
with
her
so
could
not
write
a
note
but
she
took
off
her
brooch
and
fastened
it
to
the
end
of
a
long
piece
of
string
which
by
extra
good
luck
happened
to
be
in
her
pocket
when
she
judged
that
the
right
moment
had
arrived
she
lowered
her
signal
so
that
it
would
tap
on
the
balcony
there
was
of
course
a
certain
amount
of
risk
about
the
venture
for
she
might
have
miscalculated
and
be
dropping
her
token
into
the
midst
of
enemies
instead
of
friends
greatly
to
her
relief
however
agnes
appeared
through
the
french
window
and
after
examining
the
brooch
with
apparent
surprise
glanced
upwards
and
saw
face
she
gave
a
comprehensive
smile
put
her
fingers
on
her
lips
for
silence
bolted
into
her
dormitory
and
returned
with
a
package
of
chocolate
which
she
tied
firmly
to
the
end
of
the
string
then
waved
her
hand
and
darted
back
to
her
preparation
peachy
drew
up
her
present
chuckling
with
delight
she
felt
almost
like
a
captive
of
the
middle
ages
and
was
beginning
to
plan
a
romantic
escape
down
an
improvised
rope
ladder
when
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
would
scarcely
know
what
to
do
with
her
liberty
if
she
regained
it
botheration
she
mused
unless
i
square
things
up
i
ca
walk
in
to
tea
and
i
ca
haunt
the
garden
like
a
wandering
ghost
and
i
no
money
to
pay
my
passage
on
the
steamer
so
i
ca
go
home
to
naples
nothing
for
it
but
to
stay
here
i
suppose
and
see
who
gets
tired
out
first
when
the
camellia
buds
were
able
to
meet
together
again
at
a
secret
conclave
in
the
garden
agnes
announced
the
important
fact
of
having
established
communication
with
the
prisoner
after
an
animated
discussion
they
decided
to
write
her
a
letter
and
set
forth
their
idea
of
the
situation
each
composed
a
sentence
in
turn
and
lorna
acted
as
scribe
it
ran
thus
our
noble
friend
and
camellia
sorority
desires
to
express
a
vote
of
sympathy
for
the
very
unpleasant
occurrence
that
happened
this
dalton
stars
are
the
meanest
things
on
earth
and
want
lucas
admire
you
for
the
magnificent
stand
you
are
making
but
we
do
see
how
you
are
going
to
keep
it
fergusson
frightfully
slow
without
beverley
think
you
have
to
cave
in
and
yonge
of
course
not
own
up
to
something
you
never
cameron
get
even
with
those
stars
to
make
up
for
carson
stick
in
the
sanatorium
all
cartmell
no
use
getting
too
mad
old
sport
come
right
down
and
talk
watts
this
united
effusion
was
placed
in
an
envelope
and
carried
by
agnes
to
her
dormitory
where
after
scouts
in
the
garden
had
assured
her
that
the
coast
was
clear
she
ventured
on
to
the
veranda
and
gave
a
cooee
which
brought
peachy
to
the
window
above
the
latter
let
down
her
string
and
drew
up
the
letter
which
she
pondered
upon
in
private
she
was
wise
enough
to
accept
the
good
advice
and
when
miss
bickford
appeared
later
on
she
tendered
her
apologies
the
teacher
had
possibly
repented
of
her
hasty
accusation
for
she
did
not
refer
to
the
matter
of
the
inkwells
but
merely
required
satisfaction
for
insubordination
that
being
given
peachy
was
once
more
free
though
she
could
hardly
consider
herself
restored
to
full
favor
i
used
to
like
miss
bickford
she
grumped
but
i
really
do
think
she
been
fair
over
this
why
could
she
ask
each
girl
separately
what
she
knew
about
it
much
good
that
would
have
done
bertha
and
mabel
would
have
told
the
truth
and
things
would
only
have
been
in
a
worse
muddle
we
catch
those
two
sometime
if
we
can
only
think
of
how
to
do
it
ah
that
just
the
question
even
the
stars
had
been
rather
alarmed
by
miss
bickford
firm
attitude
and
for
the
present
they
did
not
dare
to
cheat
openly
or
to
play
any
more
tricks
upon
the
form
stopped
in
this
direction
their
ringleaders
turned
their
attention
to
other
matters
what
was
the
nature
of
these
it
was
irene
lot
one
day
to
discover
she
happened
to
be
walking
in
a
rather
quiet
part
of
the
garden
a
portion
reserved
mostly
for
vegetables
which
adjoined
the
great
wall
that
separated
the
estate
from
the
highroad
as
she
sauntered
along
doing
nothing
in
particular
she
noticed
mabel
who
was
standing
under
an
orange
tree
close
to
the
wall
at
the
same
moment
advancing
towards
them
came
the
sound
of
rachel
voice
caroling
an
old
english
song
now
there
is
nothing
in
the
least
wrong
or
unorthodox
in
standing
under
an
orange
tree
yet
the
instant
irene
glimpsed
mabel
face
she
was
certain
her
schoolmate
was
in
that
particular
spot
for
some
reason
the
reverse
of
good
she
looked
uneasily
at
irene
glanced
in
rachel
direction
seemed
to
hesitate
and
finally
took
to
her
heels
and
bolted
away
through
the
bushes
next
minute
over
the
top
of
the
high
wall
descended
a
little
parcel
it
caught
in
the
branches
of
the
orange
tree
fell
to
the
ground
and
rolled
under
a
clump
of
cabbages
irene
took
no
notice
and
sauntered
on
in
the
direction
of
rachel
but
when
the
prefect
had
passed
out
of
sight
she
returned
groped
among
the
vegetables
found
the
parcel
and
slipped
it
into
her
packet
miss
mabel
hughes
i
believe
i
caught
you
tripping
this
time
she
chuckled
i
must
send
out
the
fiery
cross
and
call
an
immediate
meeting
of
the
camellia
buds
among
the
secret
practices
of
the
sorority
was
a
private
signal
only
to
be
used
in
times
of
urgent
necessity
it
had
been
suggested
by
jess
cameron
who
took
the
idea
from
lady
of
the
in
which
poem
a
gathering
of
the
clan
is
proclaimed
by
a
runner
bearing
a
cross
of
wood
charred
in
the
fire
two
burnt
matches
fastened
together
with
thread
served
the
camellia
buds
for
their
token
and
it
was
the
strictest
rite
of
their
order
that
any
one
receiving
this
cryptic
symbol
must
immediately
leave
whatever
she
happened
to
be
doing
and
proceed
to
the
rendezvous
so
promptly
did
the
members
of
the
society
respond
to
the
summons
that
within
ten
minutes
of
the
issue
of
the
fiery
cross
they
were
assembled
in
the
in
a
state
of
much
expectancy
irene
explained
how
a
parcel
had
been
thrown
over
the
wall
evidently
for
mabel
who
undoubtedly
had
been
standing
waiting
for
it
it
was
not
addressed
to
mabel
however
and
as
it
bore
no
direction
at
all
on
the
outside
the
camellia
buds
considered
themselves
justified
in
opening
it
it
contained
a
package
of
cheap
chocolate
and
a
letter
written
in
a
foreign
hand
in
rather
bad
english
me
the
compliment
to
accept
of
me
this
few
chocolate
i
like
the
letter
you
gave
to
me
on
sunday
i
will
again
present
myself
near
to
the
hotel
to
wait
upon
you
as
you
pass
accept
i
pray
you
the
assurance
of
my
profoundest
emanuele
sutoni
who
is
emanuele
sutoni
gasped
delia
and
what
he
got
to
do
with
us
nothing
to
do
with
us
frowned
jess
but
i
afraid
mabel
has
been
trying
to
get
up
some
silly
love
affair
if
miss
morley
or
miss
rodgers
found
this
out
she
be
expelled
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
it
tell
rachel
i
do
think
so
pondered
jess
you
see
of
course
we
perfectly
certain
among
ourselves
that
the
letter
was
meant
for
mabel
but
it
is
addressed
to
her
so
there
no
real
evidence
not
enough
to
convince
rachel
it
would
be
better
really
to
tell
her
we
found
out
and
that
she
got
to
stop
it
i
know
let
tar
and
feather
her
squealed
peachy
excitedly
the
best
way
to
frighten
her
of
course
i
do
mean
tar
but
soap
does
just
as
well
she
thoroughly
deserves
it
i
vote
we
do
it
we
hold
an
inquisition
in
her
dormitory
it
will
be
easy
enough
to
square
elsie
peachy
grim
idea
appealed
to
the
camellia
buds
they
considered
it
was
time
that
a
public
demonstration
was
made
against
mabel
whose
general
behavior
was
very
unworthy
of
the
traditions
of
the
villa
camellia
they
decided
to
have
their
tribunal
immediately
after
the
lights
were
turned
out
while
the
prefects
who
sat
up
later
than
the
transition
were
still
downstairs
and
the
mistresses
were
having
cocoa
in
miss
study
the
affair
was
to
be
a
surprise
for
mabel
but
as
elsie
also
slept
in
the
same
dormitory
it
was
necessary
to
secure
her
coöperation
in
case
she
might
give
the
alarm
and
summon
a
prefect
elsie
however
proved
an
easily
won
ally
i
ca
bear
mabel
she
assured
irene
you
may
do
anything
you
like
to
her
as
far
as
i
concerned
i
shall
pretend
to
be
asleep
monica
and
rosamonde
and
winnie
ca
stand
her
either
i
do
mind
telling
you
that
we
going
to
resign
from
the
starry
circle
and
found
a
new
sorority
of
our
own
it
is
good
enough
to
be
mixed
up
with
such
girls
as
mabel
and
bertha
i
glad
you
found
them
out
said
irene
it
was
high
time
somebody
made
a
protest
the
four
occupants
of
dormitory
went
to
bed
as
usual
that
night
but
as
soon
as
the
lights
were
out
lorna
and
irene
put
on
their
and
stockings
and
slipped
into
the
bathroom
here
they
hastily
completed
the
details
of
their
costumes
in
company
with
the
rest
of
the
camellia
buds
who
had
rallied
for
the
occasion
three
minutes
afterwards
a
strange
procession
entered
dormitory
ten
figures
each
wearing
a
black
mask
and
holding
a
piece
of
lighted
candle
in
her
hand
startled
the
astonished
eyes
of
mabel
hughes
who
sat
up
in
bed
to
stare
at
them
what
all
this
about
she
asked
we
come
here
to
hold
an
inquisition
on
your
conduct
replied
a
solemn
voice
from
behind
one
of
the
black
masks
will
you
kindly
get
out
of
bed
and
seat
yourself
upon
this
chair
we
should
be
sorry
to
use
force
but
i
warn
you
you
have
to
obey
us
looking
a
little
scared
mabel
apparently
thought
discretion
the
better
part
of
valor
she
rose
put
on
her
and
took
the
seat
indicated
her
inquisitors
grouped
themselves
opposite
placing
their
candles
in
a
row
upon
the
mantelpiece
their
spokeswoman
unfolding
a
large
sheet
of
paper
proceeded
to
read
the
indictment
is
to
tell
all
whom
it
may
concern
that
mabel
hughes
having
broken
every
rule
of
decent
and
orderly
behavior
and
being
no
longer
worthy
of
the
name
of
gentlewoman
is
here
arraigned
on
the
following
charges
that
she
habitually
takes
advantage
of
and
the
juniors
when
opportunity
that
she
cheats
abominably
at
her
that
she
endeavors
to
persuade
others
to
that
she
degrades
the
name
of
the
villa
camellia
by
receiving
letters
which
are
thrown
to
her
over
the
wall
and
by
handing
answers
to
them
on
her
way
to
mabel
who
had
smiled
scornfully
at
the
first
three
charges
changed
color
at
the
fourth
what
do
you
know
about
letters
she
challenged
sharply
we
know
all
ventured
the
solemn
voice
you
had
better
confess
at
once
or
the
affair
with
emanuele
will
be
exposed
to
the
prefects
it
my
own
business
said
mabel
sulkily
no
it
is
it
ours
as
well
and
the
whole
school
we
do
want
the
villa
camellia
to
be
disgraced
in
the
eyes
of
the
town
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
it
so
now
will
you
promise
to
give
up
all
your
bad
habits
and
behave
like
a
lady
i
promise
nothing
snapped
mabel
then
we
shall
be
obliged
to
tar
and
feather
you
mabel
laughed
imagining
it
was
an
empty
threat
but
she
was
rapidly
undeceived
two
inquisitors
seizing
her
by
the
arms
held
her
tightly
in
her
chair
while
several
others
smeared
soap
over
her
face
and
stuck
on
feathers
which
they
took
out
of
a
cushion
she
would
have
screamed
but
every
time
she
opened
her
mouth
to
do
so
she
received
a
dab
of
soap
upon
her
tongue
when
they
considered
her
countenance
was
sufficiently
ornamented
they
presented
her
with
a
to
view
the
effect
that
how
we
feel
about
it
the
spokeswoman
assured
her
this
is
just
to
show
you
we
wo
stand
your
horrid
ways
will
you
promise
now
to
behave
yourself
or
do
you
want
any
more
apparently
mabel
had
had
enough
she
seemed
rather
frightened
she
grumbled
that
she
would
agree
to
what
they
wished
just
jolly
well
take
care
that
you
keep
your
promise
then
warned
her
inquisitor
if
you
begin
any
of
your
old
tricks
again
we
have
evidence
against
you
and
we
shall
take
it
straight
to
rachel
if
i
know
anything
of
rachel
she
go
to
miss
rodgers
and
that
means
you
expelled
so
now
you
know
you
better
be
careful
mabel
hughes
that
all
we
came
to
say
you
may
wash
your
face
if
you
like
before
you
get
into
bed
again
the
ten
members
of
the
inquisition
knowing
that
time
was
passing
and
that
the
prefects
would
soon
be
coming
upstairs
judged
it
wise
to
break
up
the
meeting
and
taking
their
candles
beat
a
stately
retreat
to
their
respective
dormitories
lorna
and
irene
returning
to
their
cubicles
heard
elsie
chuckling
she
had
not
interfered
in
any
way
with
the
performance
but
it
had
evidently
entertained
her
she
told
the
tale
next
day
to
her
friends
with
the
result
that
ruth
rosamonde
winnie
monica
and
callie
joined
her
in
seceding
from
the
starry
circle
leaving
mabel
and
bertha
as
sole
remaining
representatives
of
that
sorority
we
fed
up
with
you
winnie
assured
the
pair
when
they
remonstrated
we
tired
of
your
sneaking
ways
and
you
may
just
keep
them
to
yourselves
we
not
going
to
let
you
copy
our
exercises
any
more
and
if
we
see
you
taking
those
kids
biscuits
again
there
be
squalls
no
we
sha
tell
you
the
name
of
our
new
sorority
we
not
going
to
have
anything
to
do
with
you
ever
again
so
there
public
opinion
had
for
once
triumphed
on
the
right
side
and
mabel
and
bertha
greatly
discomfited
found
their
influence
over
the
late
stars
was
at
an
end
the
threat
of
telling
rachel
had
frightened
mabel
she
was
uncertain
how
much
the
camellia
buds
really
knew
and
judged
it
discreet
to
drop
her
clandestine
correspondence
she
had
no
wish
for
the
matter
to
meet
the
ears
of
miss
rodgers
who
she
was
well
aware
would
take
the
most
serious
view
of
it
though
she
cherished
a
grudge
against
her
late
inquisitors
she
submitted
to
their
demands
and
for
the
time
at
any
rate
gave
no
outward
cause
for
complaint

to
have
to
announce

my
spirits

i
guess

just
the
teeniest

rampage
i
fly
all
to
pieces
and
make
a

i
just
to

lonesome
job
peachy
was
sitting
with
irene
and
delia
on
one
of
the
marble
seats
at
the
bottom
of
the
lemon
pergola
it
was
a
favorite
spot
with
the
girls
for
it
was
sheltered
from
the
prevailing
wind
and
the
flowers
grew
particularly
luxuriantly
lovely
irises
were
blooming
white
narcissus
wallflowers
and
beds
of
parma
violets
and
the
beautiful
delicate
blossom
of
the
arbutula
drooped
from
an
archway
that
spanned
the
path
irene
who
was
used
by
this
time
to
peachy
whimsical
moods
laid
aside
the
book
she
was
reading
and
laughed

old
sport

got
it
badly

do
for
you
how
where
and
when
do
you
want
to
rampage
peachy
shook
her
head
dolefully
i
do
know

of
doing
the
same
things
over
and
over
again

injun
i
take
all
the
blame
if
blame
there
is
renie
dearie
you
coming
too
got
to
i
suppose
chuckled
irene
when
the
queen
of
the
south
arises
and
gives
her
orders
her
slaves
must
and
obey
not
much
trembling
about
you
come
on
and
be
sports
both
of
you
are
you
ready
do
as
your
granny
tells
you
then
and
off
we
go
the
game
of
follow
my
leader
as
every
schoolgirl
knows
consists
in
exactly
imitating
everything
which
is
done
by
your
chief
no
matter
what
extraordinary
and
peculiar
antics
she
may
perform
to
submit
to
guidance
in
the
present
exalted
state
of
her
spirits
was
a
decided
leap
in
the
dark
but
irene
and
delia
were
ready
for
fun
and
prepared
to
take
a
few
risks
at
first
their
companion
contented
herself
with
running
in
and
out
among
the
lemon
trees
walking
along
the
low
wall
of
the
terrace
jumping
the
culvert
or
easy
physical
feats
then
having
slightly
worked
off
steam
she
stood
for
a
moment
and
paused
to
reflect
christopher
columbus
i
guess
i
know
what
i
do
i
an
exploring
fit
on
me
and
if
i
ca
find
america
i
find
something
else
new
and
undiscovered
here
goes
peachy
with
her
satellites
in
her
train
plunged
her
way
across
the
garden
in
the
direction
of
the
kitchen
she
had
suddenly
remembered
an
object
which
had
more
than
once
set
her
curiosity
in
the
yard
outside
the
scullery
there
was
an
iron
staircase
intended
for
use
as
a
from
the
servants
bedrooms
and
also
as
a
means
of
mounting
the
roof
when
workmen
wished
to
attend
to
the
up
here
she
was
determined
to
go
fortunately
the
maids
were
safely
inside
the
kitchen
and
the
defenses
were
left
unguarded
this
is
my
jacob
ladder
she
proclaimed
who
follow
me
to
the
sky
you
walk
into
my
parlor
said
the
spider
to
the
fly
the
prettiest
little
parlor
that
ever
you
did
spy
the
way
into
my
parlor
is
up
a
winding
stair
and
i
have
many
curious
things
to
show
you
when
you
there
go
on
you
lunatic
giggled
irene
and
be
quick
about
it
if
you
do
want
dominica
clattering
at
your
heels
added
delia
so
they
clambered
up
the
steep
iron
stairway
and
passing
by
the
door
that
led
to
the
servants
apartments
they
climbed
on
till
they
reached
the
roof
this
part
of
the
villa
camellia
was
to
the
school
they
decided
hastily
however
that
it
would
be
a
very
desirable
acquisition
it
was
a
large
flat
expanse
covered
with
lead
and
edged
with
a
low
battlement
it
was
evidently
used
by
the
maids
for
a
was
stretched
between
two
chimneys
and
a
row
of
towels
hung
out
to
dry
the
view
was
adorable
it
was
like
being
on
the
top
of
a
mountain
they
could
see
the
town
of
fossato
and
a
wide
expanse
of
water
and
vesuvius
and
the
distant
outline
of
naples
all
spread
in
a
panorama
before
them
besides
having
an
excellent
prospect
of
the
garden
below
peachy
who
was
ready
to
do
anything
wild
went
dancing
about
like
a
light
and
airy
light
and
airy
sure
i
feel
a
sort
of
fairy
she
extemporized
renie
beverley
you
not
mad
enough
give
me
your
hand
i
tell
you
you
got
to
dance
we
witches
who
flown
over
on
our
broomsticks
and
alighted
here
and
we
have
a
frolic
before
we
go
back
to
wherever
we
came
from
hello
what
this
business
it
looks
like
a
give
me
a
boost
somebody
for
i
going
up
to
see
it
was
rather
a
scramble
even
for
peachy
agile
limbs
but
she
was
resolved
thoroughly
to
explore
the
capacities
of
the
roof
and
the
cistern
must
not
be
left
unvisited
she
clung
on
to
its
slippery
side
and
peered
down
at
her
own
reflection
in
the
water
below
no
idea
i
looked
so
nice
she
perked
the
blue
sky
makes
a
charming
background
really
a
pool
is
quite
a
becoming
mirror
does
anybody
else
want
to
come
up
and
peep
it
like
looking
at
the
of
a
camera
rather
painful
hanging
on
though
i
think
i
drop
if
neither
of
you
coming
oh
botheration
i
lost
my
hair
ribbon
gone
right
down
inside
the
cistern
well
it
done
for
now
i
possibly
fish
it
out
it
was
your
best
consoled
delia
no
but
the
only
scarlet
one
i
possess
and
just
at
present
i
a
wild
fad
for
scarlet
i
get
crazes
for
various
colors
last
term
look
at
nothing
but
pale
blue
till
bertha
ford
got
that
new
blue
chiffon
dress
and
that
of
course
set
me
against
it
forevermore
i
a
rage
for
tartan
once
only
jess
was
rather
nasty
about
it
she
thinks
no
one
in
the
school
has
a
right
to
wear
scotch
plaids
except
herself
spent
all
my
pocket
money
for
this
week
so
i
ca
buy
another
ribbon
till
next
saturday
i
shall
have
to
go
about
in
pink
miau
i
be
such
a
good
little
i
sure
different
colors
make
me
good
or
bad
do
laugh
at
me
i
mean
it
i
a
different
person
according
to
what
i
wear
for
a
short
time
the
girls
loitered
about
on
the
roof
enjoying
the
novelty
of
their
position
and
particularly
the
fact
that
they
were
on
unlicensed
ground
and
would
undoubtedly
get
into
trouble
if
they
were
caught
by
dominica
or
anastasia
naughty
peachy
to
play
the
maids
a
trick
took
down
the
row
of
towels
folded
them
neatly
and
placed
them
in
a
pile
behind
the
cistern
chuckling
over
the
prospect
of
consternation
when
she
came
up
to
fetch
them
and
found
them
missing
i
owe
her
something
for
breaking
my
pink
alabaster
vase
she
announced
she
an
awful
smasher
with
her
duster
just
goes
surging
ahead
over
our
mantelpiece
and
sends
our
ornaments
flying
pompeii
pots
went
to
smithereens
yesterday
now
signorina
anastasia
you
wo
find
your
towels
in
too
big
a
hurry
i
guess
i
paid
you
out
she
pay
out
if
she
catches
us
up
here
suggested
delia
who
was
anxious
not
to
forfeit
her
exeat
had
we
better
be
getting
a
move
on
words
of
wisdom
my
child
fall
from
your
lips
like
pearls
and
diamonds
the
same
sage
thought
was
occurring
to
your
humble
servant
anastasia
has
what
is
commonly
called
a
tart
tongue
and
an
inconvenient
and
inconsiderate
habit
of
reporting
trifles
at
headquarters
it
would
be
quite
unnecessary
of
her
to
mention
to
miss
rodgers
that
she
had
seen
us
here
but
i
believe
she
go
out
of
her
way
to
do
it
i
sure
she
would
bad
luck
to
her
lead
on
macduff
let
descend
from
the
highlands
to
the
lowlands
we
may
find
further
sport
farther
afield
i
not
at
the
end
of
my
resources
yet
i
an
idea
or
two
more
in
my
head
nodded
peachy
escorting
her
friends
down
the
staircase
to
the
comparative
safety
of
the
back
yard
there
was
no
doubt
that
peachy
was
in
an
exceedingly
mischievous
mood
and
ready
for
any
prank
which
came
to
hand
she
dodged
with
her
followers
successfully
past
the
kitchen
door
without
attracting
the
hostile
attention
of
anastasia
or
any
other
of
the
servants
she
was
bent
on
exploring
a
patch
of
the
garden
which
was
only
accessible
from
the
rear
of
the
scullery
she
had
observed
it
from
the
of
the
roof
and
had
decided
that
by
climbing
on
to
a
low
shed
it
would
be
quite
possible
to
scale
the
wall
which
divided
the
grounds
of
the
villa
camellia
from
those
of
its
next
door
neighbor
the
girls
had
always
been
extremely
curious
about
the
villa
sutri
from
their
dormitory
windows
they
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
its
green
shutters
and
walls
set
away
among
a
thick
grove
of
trees
and
they
had
decided
that
its
garden
looked
immensely
superior
to
their
own
the
estate
belonged
to
count
sutri
who
often
spent
part
of
the
winter
and
spring
among
his
orange
groves
and
his
flowery
pergolas
he
was
supposed
to
have
a
reputation
for
gardening
and
rumors
of
his
wonderful
exotics
had
circulated
round
the
school
none
of
the
girls
however
had
ever
actually
been
inside
the
grounds
peachy
project
was
of
course
extremely
audacious
and
had
the
count
been
at
home
she
would
hardly
have
dared
to
let
it
materialize
she
had
heard
clark
mention
on
sunday
that
their
neighbor
had
started
for
a
cruise
in
his
yacht
and
that
he
would
probably
be
away
for
a
considerable
time
the
villa
will
be
shut
up
and
only
a
few
gardeners
left
about
the
place
declared
peachy
and
if
i
know
anything
of
italian
gardeners
they
all
be
sitting
smoking
inside
the
so
we
trouble
ourselves
to
worry
about
them
it
the
opportunity
of
a
lifetime
i
saw
the
whole
thing
in
a
flash
from
the
roof
there
a
shed
on
our
side
of
the
wall
and
a
shed
on
his
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
step
over
and
get
down
nothing
could
be
simpler
i
just
aching
to
explore
that
garden
delia
still
thinking
of
her
exeat
demurred
and
even
irene
valor
slightly
quailed
oh
come
on
be
sports
tempted
peachy
you
never
get
such
a
chance
in
your
lives
again
never
so
they
hesitated
and
were
lost
and
finally
followed
their
leader
up
the
low
sloping
roof
of
the
shed
as
peachy
had
prophesied
it
was
really
remarkably
easy
they
had
only
to
scale
quite
a
low
piece
of
wall
and
drop
on
to
the
roof
of
the
shed
on
the
other
side
then
scramble
down
into
count
sutri
garden
in
less
than
five
minutes
the
feat
was
accomplished
and
three
rather
awed
but
delighted
girls
were
speeding
along
a
green
alley
in
quest
of
adventure
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
being
a
beautiful
garden
it
was
more
carefully
kept
than
that
of
the
villa
camellia
and
contained
choicer
and
rarer
flowers
there
were
glorious
tanks
of
and
there
were
pergolas
of
creepers
and
the
statues
and
arbors
utterly
eclipsed
even
those
of
a
public
park
it
was
evidently
the
count
favorite
hobby
and
he
had
spared
no
expense
in
laying
out
the
grounds
rather
fearful
of
being
caught
by
some
chance
gardener
the
girls
walked
on
holding
themselves
in
readiness
to
dive
away
if
necessary
and
make
a
quick
escape
do
you
feel
like
adam
and
eve
in
paradise
queried
delia
tremulously
not
a
bit
because
they
never
got
back
after
they
were
once
turned
out
i
wish
we
could
annex
this
place
and
add
it
on
to
the
villa
camellia
the
count
ca
want
it
while
he
away
the
girls
wandered
about
in
breathless
enjoyment
stolen
waters
are
sweet
and
somebody
else
garden
seemed
much
more
attractive
than
their
own
they
did
not
dare
to
venture
too
near
the
villa
and
kept
carefully
away
from
anything
that
looked
like
a
grotto
or
a
in
which
they
might
find
a
gardener
seated
enjoying
his
cigarette
at
the
end
of
a
rose
pergola
however
peachy
made
a
discovery
it
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
flight
of
steps
leading
down
to
a
door
in
the
ground
she
stood
gazing
at
it
with
curiosity
now
i
wonder
what
that
is
she
exclaimed
illustration
wonder
what
that
is
she
exclaimed
looks
like
the
entrance
to
a
mausoleum
shuddered
delia
or
the
strong
room
where
the
count
keeps
his
money
laughed
irene
i
do
believe
it
either
i
should
be
surprised
if
it
the
passage
leading
to
the
sea
i
know
there
is
one
in
the
sutri
garden
to
get
down
to
the
bathing
cove
how
priceless
if
we
happened
to
light
upon
it
is
that
door
open
i
going
to
see
peachy
ran
down
the
steps
turned
the
handle
and
somewhat
to
her
own
astonishment
found
the
door
unlocked
she
was
peering
into
a
long
dark
tunnel
at
the
end
of
which
could
be
distinguished
a
faint
glint
of
light
this
was
indeed
an
adventure
it
seemed
a
deed
of
daring
to
explore
such
hidden
depths
but
she
was
out
to
take
risks
that
afternoon
come
along
she
commanded
bracing
up
the
spirits
of
her
more
timorous
comrades
holding
one
another
arms
particularly
tightly
the
three
entered
the
doorway
and
began
to
walk
along
the
underground
passage
it
sloped
sharply
downwards
and
was
rough
under
foot
but
the
farther
they
descended
the
brighter
grew
the
light
in
front
of
them
presently
they
had
stumbled
out
of
the
darkness
and
were
emerging
from
a
tunnel
at
the
foot
of
the
cliffs
and
stepping
out
on
to
the
sandy
shore
of
a
little
cove
it
had
always
been
a
great
grievance
at
the
villa
camellia
that
the
school
had
no
bathing
place
and
the
girls
had
greatly
coveted
the
creek
which
was
the
exclusive
property
of
their
neighbor
count
sutri
to
find
themselves
on
a
level
with
the
sea
facing
the
lapping
waves
was
exactly
what
they
had
hoped
they
ran
along
the
sand
in
huge
delight
to
the
very
edge
of
the
water
it
was
really
a
beautiful
cove
there
were
groups
of
rocks
with
smooth
pools
amongst
them
and
in
the
silvery
sand
were
numbers
of
tiny
fragile
shells
very
pretty
and
delicate
and
just
the
thing
for
a
collection
it
a
shame
it
should
all
belong
to
one
man
who
probably
hardly
ever
uses
it
flamed
peachy
now
if
only
we
could
all
come
down
here
to
bathe
would
it
be
a
stunt
the
cove
is
really
mostly
under
the
garden
of
the
villa
camellia
say
it
ought
to
belong
to
us
it
ours
for
the
moment
at
any
rate
said
irene
yes
is
it
great
we
got
it
all
to
ourselves
rejoiced
delia
dancing
along
the
beach
with
outstretched
arms
like
an
incarnation
of
zephyr
or
a
spring
vision
of
a
she
skimmed
over
the
sand
almost
as
if
she
were
flying
but
as
she
reached
the
largest
group
of
rocks
her
exalted
mood
suddenly
dissipated
and
her
high
spirits
came
down
to
earth
with
a
thud
sitting
on
the
other
side
of
the
rock
calmly
smoking
a
cigar
was
a
individual
in
a
tweed
coat
and
a
soft
hat
the
creek
which
they
had
imagined
was
their
private
paradise
was
occupied
after
all
delia
fled
back
to
her
friends
this
time
on
wings
of
fright
and
communicated
her
awful
discovery
it
must
be
count
sutri
gasped
peachy
he
ca
have
started
off
in
his
yacht
after
all
agreed
irene
i
do
he
saw
me
but
i
not
sure
about
it
panted
delia
breathlessly
whether
he
did
or
he
did
we
better
scoot
quick
opined
peachy
so
three
agitated
girls
dashed
back
over
the
sands
and
into
the
dark
tunnel
and
hurried
as
fast
as
they
could
up
the
underground
passage
expecting
every
moment
to
hear
a
footstep
behind
them
and
a
voice
demanding
to
know
what
they
were
doing
trespassing
upon
the
premises
at
the
top
of
the
tunnel
a
horrible
surprise
awaited
them
the
door
through
which
they
had
entered
was
shut
and
bolted
at
first
they
could
hardly
believe
their
ill
luck
they
groped
for
the
handle
in
the
darkness
and
pushed
and
pulled
and
turned
and
tugged
but
all
in
vain
they
even
thumped
on
the
door
and
called
hoping
to
attract
the
attention
of
a
gardener
but
there
was
no
reply
they
were
hopelessly
locked
inside
the
underground
passage
now
thoroughly
frightened
they
were
almost
in
tears
we
shall
have
to
go
back
to
the
cove
faltered
irene
and
show
ourselves
to
count
sutri
and
ask
him
to
take
us
back
somehow
gulped
peachy
we
in
for
the
biggest
row
of
our
lives
with
miss
rodgers
choked
delia
there
was
certainly
nothing
else
to
be
done
time
was
passing
quickly
and
unless
they
could
return
at
once
to
the
villa
camellia
they
would
be
late
for
preparation
very
sadly
and
soberly
they
walked
back
along
the
seashore
to
the
rocks
explain
peachy
urged
the
others
and
peachy
though
she
did
not
relish
the
task
thus
thrust
upon
her
acknowledged
that
she
was
the
instigator
of
the
whole
affair
and
therefore
responsible
for
helping
her
companions
out
of
a
decidedly
awkward
situation
the
gentleman
in
the
soft
hat
was
still
sitting
under
the
shadow
of
the
rock
smoking
but
he
rose
and
threw
away
his
cigar
as
the
deputation
of
three
advanced
to
address
him
peachy
in
her
very
best
italian
began
to
stammer
out
an
explanation
and
excuses
he
listened
for
a
moment
or
two
then
shook
his
head
and
interrupted
sorry
i
do
speak
much
italian
i
afraid
i
do
quite
understand
you
american
gasped
peachy
her
face
one
broad
smile
of
relief
we
we
thought
you
were
count
sutri
i
have
that
honor
i
only
plain
mr
bond
i
taken
the
villa
though
for
two
months
can
i
be
of
any
service
to
you
we
americans
too
sparkled
peachy
at
least
delia
and
i
are
at
school
at
the
villa
camellia
up
there
i
i
sorry
to
say
trespassing
here
we
climbed
over
the
wall
into
your
garden
and
came
down
the
passage
to
the
shore
and
now
the
door
locked
and
we
get
back
again
and
it
nearly
preparation
time
added
delia
desperately
mr
bond
eyes
twinkled
with
amusement
i
take
you
back
he
offered
it
was
hard
luck
to
find
the
door
locked
i
hardly
explored
the
place
properly
myself
yet
i
came
down
in
the
lift
the
lift
exclaimed
irene
in
surprise
yes
here
it
is
and
a
very
convenient
arrangement
too
said
mr
bond
leading
the
way
into
an
artificial
cave
close
at
hand
here
to
the
girls
amazement
was
a
perfectly
modern
and
ascenseur
nicely
upholstered
and
lighted
by
electricity
mr
bond
ushered
his
visitors
inside
closed
the
door
pressed
a
button
and
immediately
they
shot
aloft
landing
ultimately
in
a
kiosk
in
count
sutri
garden
at
the
top
of
the
cliff
feeling
as
if
a
magician
had
used
occult
means
to
transport
them
back
to
safety
the
girls
gazed
round
highly
delighted
to
find
themselves
out
of
the
cove
their
host
to
whom
they
hastily
confided
some
details
of
how
they
had
penetrated
into
his
premises
fetched
a
ladder
and
by
its
aid
they
mounted
to
the
roof
of
the
shed
and
skipped
over
the
wall
on
to
the
top
of
their
own
you
wo
tell
miss
rodgers
begged
peachy
waving
a
to
their
rescuer
after
they
had
all
protested
their
gratitude
i
guess
i
know
how
to
keep
a
secret
he
laughed
i
wo
betray
you
hope
you
be
in
time
there
goes
your
school
bell
you
run
it
fine
but
i
believe
you
just
do
it
if
you
hustle
up
three
breathless
girls
with
minds
much
too
agitated
to
apply
themselves
properly
to
french
translation
slipped
into
the
villa
camellia
at
the
eleventh
hour
and
answered
present
as
their
names
were
read
on
the
peachy
disheveled
hair
drew
down
a
rebuke
from
miss
bickford
but
this
was
such
a
very
minor
evil
that
she
took
it
meekly
smoothed
the
offending
with
her
fingers
and
composed
her
dimples
to
an
expression
of
docile
humility
we
got
out
of
that
very
well
she
purred
in
private
afterwards
thanks
to
mr
bond
and
the
lift
agreed
irene
i
guess
i
not
going
to
try
anything
so
risky
again
declared
delia
it
was
the
fix
of
my
life
i
be
down
with
nervous
prostration
should
wonder
if
i
raise
a
temperature
peachy
proctor
you
may
coax
and
tease
as
you
like
but
nothing
you
say
will
ever
induce
me
to
climb
that
wall
and
go
into
count
sutri
garden
again
it
not
worth
the
thrills
sorry
to
be
a
crab
but
i
mean
it
chapter
xiv
the
villa
bleue
delia
good
resolution
remained
only
half
fulfilled
for
after
all
she
visited
count
sutri
cove
again
this
time
however
it
was
in
a
perfectly
orthodox
fashion
and
mrs
bond
meeting
miss
morley
at
the
house
of
an
american
resident
in
fossato
invited
the
whole
school
to
come
and
view
the
garden
on
sunday
afternoon
and
clad
in
their
best
dresses
the
girls
paraded
in
through
the
gate
and
were
shown
the
beauties
of
the
lovely
grounds
they
were
taken
in
relays
down
in
the
lift
to
the
creek
by
the
sea
and
afterwards
entertained
with
and
biscuits
on
the
terrace
in
front
of
the
villa
which
was
all
very
interesting
and
delightful
though
not
nearly
so
exciting
as
the
surreptitious
peep
which
the
naughty
trio
had
previously
obtained
on
their
own
account
mr
bond
might
indeed
be
silent
on
the
subject
of
that
afternoon
adventure
but
the
expedition
into
his
grounds
had
been
only
a
part
of
peachy
pranks
in
her
game
of
follow
the
leader
and
for
one
of
her
sins
at
any
rate
she
was
to
be
called
to
account
the
cistern
on
the
top
of
the
roof
supplied
a
tap
on
the
upper
landing
from
which
anastasia
one
of
the
chambermaids
was
accustomed
to
draw
water
with
which
to
fill
the
bedroom
jugs
on
the
morning
after
the
events
just
narrated
she
took
her
can
as
usual
but
was
utterly
horrified
when
she
turned
the
tap
to
find
the
water
running
red
she
was
intensely
superstitious
and
immediately
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
she
was
the
victim
of
witchcraft
so
she
flung
her
apron
over
her
head
commenced
to
sob
and
deplored
the
early
death
which
would
probably
overtake
her
she
sat
on
the
landing
making
quite
a
scene
prophesying
evil
to
the
other
servants
who
crowded
round
to
condole
and
marvel
and
showing
the
bewitched
water
in
her
jug
with
a
mixture
of
importance
and
horror
the
girls
who
occupied
rooms
on
the
upper
landing
were
duly
thrilled
and
after
debating
every
possible
or
impossible
solution
of
the
mystery
were
on
the
point
of
carrying
the
tale
to
miss
rodgers
when
peachy
came
hurrying
along
i
only
just
heard
do
go
to
the
den
about
it
if
you
love
me
do
i
guess
i
know
what
happened
the
water
bewitched
if
you
any
sense
left
in
your
silly
head
come
with
me
on
to
the
roof
and
we
look
at
the
cistern
we
soon
find
out
the
matter
callie
lend
me
your
that
a
saintly
girl
anastasia
though
somewhat
protesting
allowed
herself
to
be
persuaded
and
went
with
peachy
first
to
the
kitchen
floor
and
then
up
the
iron
staircase
to
the
roof
approaching
the
cistern
peachy
climbed
on
to
its
edge
lowered
her
and
presently
fished
up
a
wet
and
draggled
scarlet
ribbon
which
stained
her
fingers
red
as
she
held
it
out
to
anastasia
astonished
gaze
i
guess
it
this
that
has
been
bleeding
inside
the
tank
and
has
stained
the
water
she
explained
but
signorina
i
ask
how
it
place
itself
there
demanded
the
still
puzzled
chambermaid
in
her
halting
english
then
overmastering
native
superstition
she
burst
into
laughter
oh
oh
oh
it
is
no
magic
but
you
signorina
who
hid
my
towels
i
go
to
tell
mees
rodgers
yes
you
shall
get
into
very
big
scrape
no
anastasia
do
tell
implored
peachy
it
was
only
a
joke
look
here
are
you
fond
of
chocolates
i
had
a
box
sent
me
yesterday
and
you
shall
have
them
all
it
wo
do
any
good
to
tell
miss
rodgers
will
it
you
not
come
on
to
this
roof
again
and
touch
my
towels
conceded
anastasia
doubtfully
never
i
promise
faithfully
then
i
not
tell
good
you
a
white
angel
i
square
the
girls
and
get
them
not
to
mind
washing
in
pink
water
for
a
day
or
two
it
ought
to
improve
their
complexions
so
we
just
say
nothing
at
all
about
it
at
headquarters
that
settled
anastasia
your
english
is
improving
wonderfully
i
guess
i
teach
you
some
american
next
it
the
finest
language
in
the
world
botheration
i
soused
callie
i
do
know
what
she
say
about
it
i
out
of
one
scrape
into
another
the
whole
time
well
i
rather
face
callie
than
miss
rodgers
anyhow
she
may
storm
but
she
ca
give
me
bad
marks
or
stop
my
next
exeat
come
along
anastasia
we
take
the
ribbon
with
us
to
show
as
a
trophy
it
will
give
them
a
little
bit
of
a
surprise
downstairs
if
i
not
mistaken
owing
to
luck
and
to
the
kindness
of
anastasia
peachy
pranks
did
not
on
this
occasion
meet
with
any
punishment
irene
who
had
been
greatly
fearing
an
exposure
of
the
whole
escapade
once
more
breathed
freely
if
the
matter
had
come
to
the
ears
of
miss
rodgers
the
three
girls
would
certainly
have
been
gated
and
irene
was
particularly
anxious
not
to
lose
her
approaching
exeat
it
was
her
turn
to
go
to
tea
at
the
villa
bleue
and
she
was
looking
forward
greatly
to
the
occasion
it
would
be
her
first
visit
for
she
had
forfeited
her
privilege
earlier
in
the
term
when
she
and
lorna
lost
themselves
among
the
olive
groves
much
to
their
satisfaction
the
buddies
were
invited
together
in
company
with
mary
sheila
monica
and
winnie
who
were
also
on
the
good
conduct
list
of
course
there
was
considerable
prinking
in
front
of
the
careful
adjusting
of
hair
ribbons
and
other
trifles
of
toilet
before
the
girls
considered
themselves
in
party
trim
and
ready
to
do
credit
to
the
villa
camellia
escorted
by
miss
brewster
who
acted
chaperon
or
policewoman
as
sheila
insisted
on
calling
her
they
walked
in
orderly
file
down
the
eucalyptus
avenue
to
the
town
past
the
hotel
along
the
esplanade
and
up
a
steep
incline
to
the
villa
bleue
the
hospitable
little
parsonage
seemed
an
exact
materialization
of
the
personality
of
its
owners
canon
and
clark
were
both
small
and
smiling
and
charitable
and
particularly
kind
and
their
tiny
unpretentious
dwelling
with
its
sunny
aspect
and
its
flowers
and
its
pet
birds
was
absolutely
in
keeping
with
their
tone
of
mind
from
some
houses
seem
to
emanate
certain
mental
atmospheres
as
if
they
reflected
the
sum
total
of
the
thoughts
that
have
collected
there
and
sensitive
visitors
receive
subconscious
impressions
of
chilly
magnificence
intellectual
activity
or
a
spirit
of
general
tolerance
the
villa
bleue
always
felt
radiant
with
kind
and
cheery
impulses
and
its
walls
seemed
almost
to
shine
as
the
girls
secure
of
a
welcome
parted
from
miss
brewster
and
ran
up
the
steps
to
the
pleasant
veranda
clark
made
them
at
home
at
once
she
had
six
cosy
waiting
for
them
and
a
plateful
of
most
delicious
almond
taffy
and
she
installed
them
to
sit
and
admire
the
view
while
she
talked
and
put
them
at
their
ease
schoolgirls
are
notoriously
bashful
visitors
and
in
certain
circumstances
all
six
would
have
been
mum
as
mice
and
entirely
devoid
of
conversation
except
a
conventional
yes
or
no
but
with
dear
clark
beaming
face
and
manner
to
disarm
their
shyness
they
were
perfectly
natural
and
enjoyed
themselves
as
entirely
as
if
they
were
at
a
dormitory
tea
or
a
sorority
supper
the
best
part
about
clark
was
that
she
had
the
happy
knack
of
forgetting
her
age
and
throwing
herself
back
into
the
mental
environment
of
sixteen
she
was
certainly
not
a
stiff
hostess
indeed
her
treatment
of
her
guests
was
less
conventional
than
that
adopted
by
rachel
moseley
at
the
prefects
parties
she
laughed
and
chatted
and
asked
questions
about
the
school
till
in
a
few
minutes
the
girls
were
chattering
like
sparrows
and
behaving
as
if
they
had
known
her
for
years
tea
was
set
out
on
little
basket
tables
in
the
veranda
and
there
were
all
the
delicious
things
for
which
the
villa
bleue
had
gained
a
just
reputation
brown
scones
and
honey
potato
cakes
scotch
shortbread
buttered
oatmeal
biscuits
iced
lemon
sandwich
cake
and
chocolate
fingers
when
tea
was
taken
away
and
the
basket
tables
were
once
more
free
clark
produced
dainty
cards
and
scarlet
pencils
and
organized
a
competition
it
was
entitled
nursery
rhymes
and
contained
twenty
questions
to
be
answered
by
the
competitors
these
ran
as
follows
nursery
rhymes
competition
who
made
cock
robin
shroud
who
was
exhausted
by
family
cares
who
disliked
insects
who
showed
an
interest
in
horticulture
who
summoned
an
orchestra
who
pursued
matrimonial
intentions
without
the
parental
sanction
who
showed
religious
intolerance
who
took
a
joint
that
did
not
belong
to
him
who
deplored
the
loss
of
hand
gear
whose
salary
was
restricted
owing
to
slackness
in
work
what
animal
pursued
horological
investigations
who
made
the
record
high
jump
who
wore
a
superfluity
of
jewelry
whose
culinary
efforts
were
temporarily
confiscated
who
pulled
pussy
from
the
well
who
slept
instead
of
attending
to
business
who
exhibited
sanctimonious
satisfaction
over
a
meal
who
lost
a
number
of
domestic
animals
who
had
an
accident
during
the
performance
of
their
duty
who
was
mutilated
by
a
bird
some
of
the
questions
seemed
easy
and
some
were
difficult
the
girls
sat
puzzling
over
them
and
writing
the
answers
when
they
got
inspiration
irene
scribbled
away
delightedly
but
lorna
who
had
almost
forgotten
the
nursery
rhymes
of
her
childhood
was
in
much
mystification
and
only
filled
in
a
few
of
the
vacant
spaces
numbers
and
proved
the
most
baffling
and
no
one
was
able
to
solve
all
twenty
after
allowing
a
considerable
laxity
in
respect
of
time
clark
rang
the
bell
and
declared
the
competition
closed
the
girls
changed
cards
and
waited
with
interest
while
their
hostess
read
out

answers

capabilities
of
her
host
oh
yes
please
tell
us
a
story
agreed
the
others
we
like
it
better
than
anything
i
have
one
inside
my
desk
which
is
just
ready
to
send
off
to
a
magazine
if
it
wo
bore
you
to
listen
to
it
i
read
it
aloud
and
let
you
judge
whether
it
has
any
interest
in
it
or
not
an
audience
of
schoolgirls
ought
to
be
severe
critics
as
a
rule
they
omnivorous
readers
of
fiction
if
you
turn
it
down
i
shall
tear
it
up
oh
but
we
sha
begin
thus
urged
canon
clark
fetched
a
manuscript
from
his
study
and
after
passing
round
the
plate
of
taffy
to
sweeten
his
narrative
as
he
put
it
he
sat
down
in
his
on
the
veranda
and
began
to
read
the
luck
of
dacrepool
i
had
known
jack
musgrave
out
east
we
had
chummed
at
mandalay
messed
together
at
singapore
hunted
big
game
up
in
kashmir
and
shot
tigers
in
bengal
and
when
we
said
as
he
boarded
the
steamer
at
madras
it
was
with
a
cordial
invitation
on
his
part
that
i
should
look
him
up
if
ever
i
happened
to
penetrate
into
the
remote
corner
of
cumberland
where
his
family
acres
were
situated
for
a
year
or
two
my
affairs
kept
me
in
india
and
nothing
seemed
more
unlikely
than
that
for
the
present
at
any
rate
jack
and
i
should
cross
paths
again
but
by
one
of
those
strange
chances
which
sometimes
occur
in
this
world
i
found
myself
on
the
christmas
eve
of
standing
on
the
platform
of
holdergate
station
having
missed
the
connection
for
scotland
and
with
the
pleasing
prospect
before
me
of
spending
the
night
and
possibly
if
trains
were
not
available
the
ensuing
christmas
day
at
the
one
very
inn
in
the
village
it
was
then
that
i
remembered
that
holdergate
was
the
nearest
station
to
dacrepool
grange
and
that
if
jack
memory
still
held
good
i
might
find
a
hearty
welcome
and
spend
a
pleasant
evening
recalling
old
times
and
discussing
past
shots
instead
of
putting
up
with
the
inferior
accommodation
offered
by
the
landlady
of
the
arms
as
no
one
either
at
the
station
or
in
the
village
seemed
willing
to
vouchsafe
me
definite
information
as
to
whether
the
owner
of
dacrepool
was
at
home
or
abroad
parrying
my
inquiries
with
such
scant
courtesy
and
in
so
uncouth
and
unintelligible
a
dialect
as
to
be
scarce
understood
i
resolved
to
chance
it
and
with
some
difficulty
hiring
a
farmer
gig
i
started
out
on
a
drive
over
the
bleak
moorlands
which
seemed
to
stretch
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
in
a
dim
vista
of
brown
heath
and
distant
fell
it
was
a
dreary
and
unseasonable
evening
with
a
damp
mist
rising
from
the
sodden
ground
and
occasional
falls
of
sleet
mingled
with
rain
that
chilled
one
to
the
bone
i
buttoned
my
coat
closely
round
my
throat
and
braced
my
nerves
to
meet
the
elements
hoping
i
might
find
my
reward
at
the
end
of
my
journey
and
inwardly
cursing
every
mile
of
the
rough
road
but
even
cumberland
miles
can
not
wind
on
forever
and
my
jehu
at
length
drew
up
at
a
massive
stone
gateway
which
he
assured
me
formed
the
entrance
to
dacrepool
grange
there
was
neither
light
nor
sound
in
the
lodge
nor
did
any
one
come
out
in
answer
to
our
impatient
calls
so
we
had
perforce
to
open
the
gates
for
ourselves
they
creaked
on
their
rusty
hinges
as
if
they
had
not
been
unclosed
for
many
a
day
and
when
i
noted
the
neglected
drive
where
the
overhanging
trees
swept
our
faces
as
we
passed
i
began
to
fear
that
i
had
come
on
a
fool
errand
and
that
i
should
find
the
house
shut
up
and
my
friend
abroad
on
this
point
however
my
driver
reassured
me
to
home
theer
a
light
i
yon
winder
he
said
pointing
with
his
whip
where
a
faint
streak
of
yellow
shone
like
a
beacon
into
the
surrounding
gloom
the
moon
was
struggling
through
the
clouds
and
i
could
dimly
discern
the
outline
of
the
quaint
gabled
front
of
the
house
with
its
mullioned
windows
and
masses
of
clinging
ivy
dismounting
at
the
old
stone
porch
i
seized
the
knocker
and
beat
a
mighty
tattoo
there
was
no
reply
even
the
light
had
disappeared
from
the
window
almost
simultaneously
with
the
approach
of
our
carriage
wheels
and
though
i
hammered
for
fully
five
minutes
i
failed
to
obtain
the
slightest
response
to
my
knocks
i
was
on
the
point
of
turning
away
in
despair
and
driving
back
in
the
gig
to
holdergate
when
a
sound
of
footsteps
was
heard
within
together
with
an
unbolting
and
unbarring
the
door
was
opened
about
six
inches
on
the
chain
and
a
woman
peeped
cautiously
out
into
the
darkness
i
at
once
proclaimed
my
identity
and
my
errand
but
by
the
light
of
the
candle
which
she
held
in
her
hand
she
looked
me
up
and
down
with
a
glance
of
keen
distrust
and
evident
disfavor
am
i
to
know
it
is
as
you
say
she
replied
guardedly
and
without
making
any
move
to
grant
me
admittance
fetch
your
master
i
exclaimed
with
some
heat
thrusting
my
card
into
her
hand
should
know
my
name
at
any
rate
though
he
seems
to
have
trained
you
in
strange
notions
of
hospitality
to
keep
a
guest
standing
on
the
doorstep
on
a
bitter
evening
in
december
grumbling
under
her
breath
she
went
away
and
i
was
half
inclined
to
follow
her
example
and
quit
this
very
unpromising
spot
when
a
quick
step
resounded
in
the
hall
the
door
was
flung
open
wide
and
i
was
dragged
forcibly
into
the
house
by
my
friend
jack
who
hailed
me
with
such
unfeigned
delight
and
enthusiasm
that
there
could
be
little
doubt
of
the
genuineness
of
his
welcome
sprung
upon
us
at
a
queer
time
as
it
happens
old
man
but
if
you
do
mind
taking
we
spend
a
ripping
night
together
he
cried
hauling
me
into
the
where
a
pretty
fairy
of
a
girl
sprang
up
to
greet
us
is
my
sister
bessie
and
i
talked
about
you
so
often
that
she
give
you
as
big
a
welcome
as
i
do
it
only
a
poor
best
we
can
show
you
in
the
way
of
entertainment
but
you
make
allowances
when
i
tell
you
how
i
situated
and
what
we
lack
in
kind
we
must
make
up
in
good
will
good
enough
for
you
will
be
good
enough
for
me
i
replied
heartily
submitting
to
be
relieved
of
my
coat
and
installed
in
the
best
chair
by
the
blazing
fire
a
pleasant
change
indeed
from
the
cold
and
the
sleet
outside
must
not
think
our
guests
usually
receive
such
a
churlish
reception
said
jack
laughing
a
little
the
fact
is
we
took
you
for
the
bailiffs
i
sorry
to
say
i
outrun
the
constable
it
really
not
my
fault
for
the
old
place
was
mortgaged
to
its
last
penny
when
it
fell
to
me
but
as
the
case
stands
i
enduring
a
kind
of
siege
dare
put
my
nose
out
of
my
own
door
for
fear
i
should
be
served
with
writs
and
have
to
smuggle
what
supplies
we
can
beg
or
borrow
through
the
kitchen
window
it
a
queer
kind
of
christmas
to
spend
and
a
poor
lookout
for
the
new
year
for
i
afraid
the
old
place
is
bound
to
go
in
the
end
though
i
have
vowed
to
stick
to
it
as
long
as
i
can
hold
it
and
bessie
has
vowed
to
stick
to
me
though
she
might
have
a
more
cheerful
home
elsewhere
if
she
liked
there
precious
little
to
offer
you
in
our
larder
but
perhaps
we
can
furnish
up
something
in
the
way
of
supper
ca
we
bessie
miss
musgrave
laughed
merrily
harper
must
imagine
himself
back
in
camp
she
replied
hope
he
can
manage
to
subsist
on
porridge
and
cheese
and
tinned
provisions
for
i
do
think
we
have
anything
better
to
offer
him
i
would
have
subsisted
on
a
far
poorer
diet
to
remain
within
sight
of
those
bright
eyes
and
i
endeavored
to
convince
my
host
and
hostess
that
i
desired
nothing
more
than
to
be
treated
as
one
of
themselves
with
such
success
that
i
seemed
to
drop
at
once
into
the
family
circle
and
never
spent
a
pleasanter
or
more
jovial
evening
in
my
life
jack
and
i
sat
up
late
after
bessie
had
retired
chatting
of
bygone
days
and
past
adventures
till
the
jungles
and
plains
seemed
almost
more
real
than
the
cheery
blaze
of
the
fire
before
us
but
the
talk
came
round
at
last
to
the
affairs
of
the
moment
not
there
any
plan
by
which
you
could
raise
the
wind
jack
i
inquired
a
one
i
tried
every
end
up
but
there
seems
no
way
out
of
the
trouble
unless
indeed
we
could
find
sir
godfrey
treasure
he
ancestor
of
mine
rather
a
back
number
considering
he
died
somewhere
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
but
a
restless
old
gentleman
for
he
is
still
said
to
have
a
trick
of
haunting
the
house
and
according
to
popular
tradition
hoping
to
be
able
to
point
out
the
of
a
treasure
he
stowed
away
it
genuine
treasure
believe
so
he
went
off
to
fight
in
the
civil
wars
and
hid
the
family
plate
and
jewels
in
a
secure
place
which
nobody
knew
of
but
himself
he
had
not
the
sense
to
leave
any
record
of
the
spot
and
when
he
was
killed
at
naseby
his
secret
died
with
him
and
the
valuables
unless
as
i
sometimes
suspect
the
old
chap
had
previously
pledged
them
were
not
forthcoming
nor
have
they
ever
been
heard
of
since
he
ever
appeared
to
you
he
i
only
wish
he
would
the
hoard
would
be
a
jolly
windfall
to
me
if
i
could
manage
to
light
upon
it
but
i
not
the
kind
who
goes
about
seeing
ghosts
i
too
plain
and
by
half
and
though
i
often
hear
mysterious
taps
on
the
panels
of
my
bedroom
i
prosaically
set
it
down
to
rats
and
mice
now
you
a
psychic
sort
of
a
fellow
the
seventh
son
of
a
seventh
son
if
he
wants
to
make
himself
visible
perhaps
you
may
get
a
sight
of
him
i
afraid
it
more
than
ever
i
shall
there
no
clew
at
all
left
as
to
the
of
the
treasure
i
inquired
an
old
rhyme
so
obscure
as
to
be
quite
unintelligible
he
who
plucks
a
rose
at
yule
will
bring
back
luck
to
dacrepool
even
you
with
your
fondness
for
antiquities
and
rummaging
strange
things
out
of
old
books
can
scarcely
make
anything
of
that
i
should
say
i
shook
my
head
for
the
riddle
seemed
quite
unreadable
and
as
we
had
already
sat
up
until
long
past
midnight
i
begged
for
my
candle
and
proposed
to
defer
our
conversation
until
the
morning
jack
declaring
that
none
of
the
beds
in
the
damp
old
house
was
fit
to
sleep
in
without
a
week
of
previous
airing
insisted
upon
giving
up
his
room
to
me
and
passing
the
night
himself
on
the
sofa
and
in
spite
of
my
protestations
i
was
forced
to
acquiesce
in
his
plans
for
my
comfort
left
alone
i
looked
with
some
curiosity
round
the
gloomy
chamber
where
the
flashed
on
the
carved
with
its
faded
yellow
damask
curtains
and
lit
up
the
tapestry
that
adorned
a
portion
of
the
upper
part
of
the
walls
but
scarcely
illumined
the
dark
corners
which
lay
beyond
there
were
quaint
old
presses
and
chests
roomy
enough
to
hide
a
dozen
ghosts
in
and
a
portrait
of
a
gentleman
in
the
elaborate
costume
of
the
stuart
period
seemed
to
look
down
upon
me
with
strangely
haunting
eyes
spooky
enough
place
i
murmured
by
the
spirits
of
numerous
generations
no
doubt
well
i
undertake
they
wo
disturb
me
for
i
am
and
mean
to
sleep
like
a
log
i
am
an
old
traveler
and
was
soon
in
bed
and
enjoying
a
slumber
but
my
dreams
were
wild
for
i
seemed
now
to
be
driving
furiously
over
the
moorland
pursuing
ever
the
phantom
of
pretty
bessie
who
with
her
bewitching
smile
was
luring
me
into
the
fog
and
darkness
and
now
to
be
barring
the
front
door
to
defend
her
from
some
unknown
assailant
whose
perpetual
rapping
rang
like
an
echo
through
my
brain
with
the
impotent
strength
of
dreamland
i
struggled
vainly
to
close
the
door
which
was
opening
slowly
to
admit
the
nameless
horror
i
seemed
to
feel
a
hot
breath
on
my
cheek
and
with
a
wild
shriek
i
woke
to
find
the
moonlight
streaming
in
through
the
broad
window
falling
in
a
white
shaft
across
the
floor
while
the
last
embers
of
the
fire
were
smoldering
to
ashes
upon
the
hearth
i
sat
up
in
bed
with
that
feeling
of
broad
awakeness
and
alertness
which
comes
to
us
sometimes
and
caught
my
breath
as
i
listened
for
through
the
stillness
of
the
night
came
the
unmistakable
sound
of
a
gentle
tapping
from
behind
the
paneling
of
the
wall
it
was
not
continuous
but
more
as
one
might
rap
at
the
chamber
door
of
a
sleeping
person
waiting
every
now
and
then
to
hear
if
one
had
obtained
a
response
an
intense
and
vivid
sensation
came
over
me
that
i
was
not
alone
in
the
room
that
there
was
some
presence
other
than
my
own
personality
which
was
striving
in
some
way
to
force
itself
upon
my
consciousness
and
arrest
my
attention
was
it
only
my
fancy
or
were
the
moonbeams
actually
shaping
themselves
into
a
human
form
till
against
the
dark
background
of
the
fireplace
i
seemed
to
see
the
misty
shadowy
outline
of
a
figure
so
vague
and
ethereal
that
even
as
i
looked
it
appeared
to
melt
again
into
the
moonlight
and
cease
to
exist
with
every
nerve
on
the
stretch
i
strained
my
eyes
to
gain
a
clearer
impression
a
passing
cloud
left
the
room
for
a
few
moments
in
darkness
but
as
the
beams
shone
out
full
and
clear
once
more
that
shadowy
figure
seemed
to
gather
substance
and
i
felt
as
if
some
unknown
force
were
compelling
my
attention
and
chaining
my
every
sense
in
a
mute
endeavor
to
establish
some
chord
of
connection
between
me
and
the
dim
spirit
world
which
floats
forever
round
us
now
waxing
now
waning
the
vision
grew
till
i
fancied
i
caught
a
glint
of
armor
for
an
instant
a
wild
imploring
glance
met
my
own
and
a
transparent
finger
pointed
to
the
paneling
below
the
arras
but
as
i
sprang
from
the
bed
the
vision
faded
swiftly
away
leaving
me
standing
on
the
floor
in
the
calm
moonlight
doubting
the
evidence
of
my
senses
and
half
convinced
that
i
must
still
have
been
in
the
continuance
of
my
dream
yet
as
i
looked
something
in
the
carved
paneling
struck
my
notice
and
following
the
direction
in
which
the
spectral
finger
had
pointed
i
saw
that
the
dragons
and
the
twisted
scrolls
were
united
in
the
center
by
a
tudor
rose
in
an
instant
there
flashed
across
my
mind
the
old
saying
which
jack
had
quoted
he
who
plucks
a
rose
at
yule
will
bring
back
luck
to
dacrepool
what
impulse
urged
me
i
can
not
say
but
compelled
by
some
seemingly
irresistible
suggestion
i
seized
the
sculptured
rose
and
wrenched
at
it
with
all
my
strength
there
was
a
dull
thud
followed
by
a
harsh
grinding
noise
and
the
whole
of
the
paneling
slid
slowly
back
revealing
a
cavity
behind
where
half
hidden
by
the
accumulations
of
dust
and
cobwebs
i
could
catch
a
sight
of
silver
tankards
and
masses
of
plate
enough
to
make
the
mouth
of
a
collector
water
with
envy
still
scarcely
certain
whether
i
was
sleeping
or
waking
i
put
in
my
hand
and
drew
out
a
bag
filled
with
something
heavy
and
even
as
i
did
so
the
rotten
mildewed
canvas
broke
with
the
strain
and
a
stream
of
golden
coins
descended
with
a
clatter
upon
the
floor
like
a
maniac
i
rushed
to
my
door
and
hallooed
lustily
for
jack
who
roused
by
my
shouts
came
hurrying
up
in
scanty
attire
with
a
revolver
in
one
hand
and
a
poker
in
the
other
is
it
old
man
thieves
or
bailiffs
just
hold
till
i
come
ca
you
neither
i
replied
as
i
hauled
him
in
with
triumph
i
believe
i
have
had
a
visit
from
your
esteemed
ancestor
and
as
a
christmas
gift
allow
me
to
introduce
you
to
the
family
treasure
there
was
no
mistake
about
it
it
was
real
enough
and
as
the
christmas
bells
came
chiming
through
the
frosty
air
we
turned
out
bags
of
gold
piles
of
silver
and
priceless
jewels
warranted
to
redeem
dacrepool
grange
twice
over
if
necessary
and
sending
jack
into
a
very
ecstasy
of
joy
jove
old
chap
he
exclaimed
owe
it
all
to
you
here
i
slept
in
this
room
for
years
and
never
paid
any
heed
to
the
raps
and
taps
though
i
heard
them
often
enough
while
the
treasure
was
under
my
very
nose
only
waiting
to
be
discovered
then
you
come
along
with
your
eyes
and
the
spirit
if
spirit
it
was
is
able
to
convey
to
you
the
secret
it
been
trying
to
get
off
its
mind
for
hundreds
of
years
you
saved
me
from
the
bankruptcy
court
and
a
debt
of
gratitude
you
find
i
sha
lightly
forget
it
was
a
very
jovial
christmas
which
we
spent
that
day
for
the
news
of
the
find
got
abroad
at
daylight
and
we
were
promptly
visited
by
the
butcher
and
baker
bringing
stores
of
good
cheer
and
profuse
apologies
for
past
misunderstandings
even
the
severe
old
servant
relapsed
into
smiles
as
she
bore
in
a
smoking
sirloin
of
beef
spirits
rose
to
the
wildest
pitch
and
little
bessie
who
persisted
in
calling
me
the
savior
of
the
family
credit
could
scarcely
do
enough
to
show
her
gratitude
jack
wanted
me
to
share
the
best
of
the
jewels
with
him
and
was
so
annoyed
at
my
refusal
that
i
could
only
gain
peace
by
a
hint
that
i
should
sometime
ask
him
for
something
more
valuable
still
and
i
got
my
way
for
my
unexpected
visit
lengthened
out
to
a
stay
of
some
weeks
during
which
pretty
bessie
gratitude
had
time
to
ripen
into
a
warmer
feeling
so
in
the
end
it
was
quite
a
different
treasure
which
i
bore
away
from
dacrepool
grange
and
i
feel
equally
with
jack
that
i
have
cause
to
remember
that
strange
christmas
eve
and
to
render
my
thanks
to
old
sir
godfrey
who
now
sleeps
soundly
in
his
grave
secure
in
the
accomplishment
of
his
mission
having
rid
his
soul
of
the
burden
of
his
secret
and
restored
luck
to
dacrepool
is
it
true
asked
sheila
as
canon
clark
folded
up
his
manuscript
well
i
can
hardly
call
it
a
personal
reminiscence
but
you
must
allow
for
author
license
old
historic
houses
sometimes
have
secret
and
dreams
are
undoubtedly
strange
things
it
all
founded
upon
legends
which
i
have
heard
clark
and
i
first
met
in
an
ancient
grange
not
at
all
unlike
dacrepool
did
we
bess
and
if
we
did
find
treasure
behind
the
paneling
we
certainly
ought
to
have
done
so
now
i
extremely
sorry
to
have
to
hurry
you
but
i
promised
miss
morley
that
you
should
be
back
at
school
by
half
past
six
and
i
undertook
to
escort
you
through
the
town
i
hope
you
all
come
and
have
tea
with
us
some
afternoon
next
term
and
we
have
another
competition
do
say
to
clark
give
the
italian
rivederci
instead
because
that
means
not
a
parting
greeting
but
we
see
one
another
again
chapter
xv
peachy
birthday
delia
watts
walking
one
afternoon
along
the
lemon
pergola
came
across
a
small
group
of
camellia
buds
ensconced
in
a
cozy
corner
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
by
the
fountain
hello
you
found
a
dandy
place
here
you
look
so
comfy
may
i
join
on
she
chirped
said
jess
cordially
pushing
irene
farther
along
to
make
room
come
and
squat
down
dearie
and
add
your
voice
to
the
powwow
we
just
discussing
something
fearfully
urgent
and
important
do
you
know
it
be
peachy
birthday
next
week
of
course
i
know
nobody
could
room
with
peachy
and
not
hear
about
that
she
the
most
excited
girl
on
earth
she
been
promised
a
gold
and
a
morocco
and
i
ca
tell
you
what
else
and
she
just
living
till
she
gets
them
i
wish
it
was
my
birthday
jealous
do
be
such
a
pig
responded
jess
you
got
your
fun
in
the
holidays
you
ca
have
things
twice
over
what
we
were
talking
about
was
this
the
sorority
ought
to
rally
somehow
and
give
peachy
a
surprise
ca
we
get
up
a
special
stunt
rather
put
me
on
the
committee
please
could
we
get
leave
for
a
dormitory
tea
i
know
miss
rodgers
rather
frowned
on
them
last
term
but
perhaps
if
we
wheedled
miss
morley
she
say
we
promise
to
clear
up
and
not
make
any
mess
and
to
finish
promptly
before
prep
time
that
ought
to
content
her
what
votes
every
hand
ascended
with
enthusiasm
good
for
you
delia
complimented
jess
we
have
had
a
dormitory
tea
for
just
ages
not
in
fact
since
aggie
upset
the
i
think
miss
morley
forgotten
that
now
though
you
must
do
the
asking
yourself
you
our
champion
wheedler
if
anybody
can
soften
miss
morley
hard
heart
it
will
be
you
tell
her
peachy
will
be
homesick
and
we
feel
it
be
our
duty
to
cheer
her
up
a
little
i
pitch
it
as
strong
as
i
can
said
delia
but
of
course
it
no
use
going
too
far
peachy
does
look
a
homesick
subject
in
need
of
cheering
i
afraid
miss
morley
may
snort
if
i
put
it
on
that
score
i
better
just
explain
we
want
to
have
a
stunt
i
believe
she
catch
on
leave
it
to
me
and
i
try
my
best
to
manage
her
we
give
you
carte
blanche
then
i
waddle
off
now
delia
success
mostly
depended
upon
tact
she
judged
that
if
she
asked
miss
morley
tired
at
the
end
of
a
busy
morning
she
would
probably
meet
with
a
curt
refusal
but
that
if
she
found
her
seated
in
her
own
soothed
with
afternoon
tea
and
reading
a
delectable
book
her
sympathy
would
be
much
more
readily
aroused
on
this
occasion
delia
judgment
was
correct
after
a
perfectly
harmonious
interview
with
the
principal
she
scurried
back
to
her
fellow
camellia
buds
her
face
one
satisfied
grin
she
said
my
dear
we
may
ask
elvira
for
a
special
teapot
and
a
plate
of
bread
and
butter
and
we
may
give
antonio
three
lira
apiece
to
buy
us
cakes
we
may
do
what
we
like
so
long
as
the
room
is
tidy
again
before
prep
she
send
a
prefect
at
to
inspect
if
the
place
is
in
a
muddle
it
be
the
last
time
so
we
better
be
careful
for
i
could
see
she
meant
that
we
in
luck
cried
irene
giving
a
bounce
of
rapture
it
great
yummy
i
thought
you
congratulate
me
smirked
delia
now
let
get
busy
and
decide
what
sort
of
a
stunt
we
mean
to
have
is
peachy
to
know
or
is
it
to
be
a
surprise
that
the
question
she
have
to
be
told
and
invited
and
all
the
rest
of
it
but
she
need
hear
any
details
beforehand
i
vote
we
all
arrange
to
come
in
fancy
costume
that
would
really
be
a
stunt
we
shall
have
to
tell
peachy
no
you
must
we
have
a
costume
all
ready
prepared
for
her
like
the
wedding
garment
in
the
parable
she
have
nothing
to
do
but
slip
it
on
if
peachy
was
looking
forward
to
her
own
birthday
her
friends
were
anticipating
the
happy
event
with
enthusiasm
they
had
decided
to
hold
the
festivities
in
her
dormitory
but
had
required
her
to
give
a
solemn
pledge
not
to
enter
the
room
after
so
as
to
give
them
a
free
hand
during
the
before
they
met
and
held
a
decoration
bee
nine
determined
girls
who
have
prepared
their
materials
can
work
wonders
in
a
short
time
and
in
ten
hurried
minutes
they
accomplished
a
vast
amount
mary
lend
a
hand
and
help
me
stand
on
the
dressing
table
she
wo
know
the
place
when
she
sees
it
are
we
all
busy
bees
it
begins
to
look
rather
nice
does
it
do
tug
this
chain
it
tearing
now
you
done
it
i
flatter
myself
she
get
the
surprise
of
her
life
with
flags
paper
chains
and
garlands
of
flowers
the
decorators
contrived
to
make
dormitory
look
absolutely
they
borrowed
a
table
from
another
bedroom
placed
the
two
together
covered
them
with
a
cloth
and
spread
forth
the
cakes
which
antonio
had
been
commissioned
to
buy
elvira
will
fetch
us
the
teapot
and
the
bread
and
butter
at
four
we
can
yank
into
our
costumes
in
a
few
seconds
so
we
need
waste
much
time
do
let
miss
darrer
keep
you
dawdling
about
the
studio
urged
agnes
no
fear
of
that
the
moment
the
bell
goes
it
will
be
pencils
she
can
hold
forth
to
the
others
if
she
wants
to
talk
after
school
by
the
by
everybody
jealous
of
us
i
know
the
seniors
are
grumbling
like
anything
because
they
think
of
having
a
bedroom
tea
for
phyllis
it
their
own
fault
they
have
another
birthday
amongst
them
this
term
that
the
grievance
and
miss
morley
wo
give
leave
for
a
dormitory
stunt
unless
somebody
birthday
she
firm
on
that
point
we
certainly
all
the
luck
the
camellia
buds
pursued
their
art
studies
that
afternoon
with
a
certain
abstraction
peachy
worked
with
her
left
wrist
poised
so
that
she
could
obtain
a
perpetual
view
of
the
new
gold
watch
that
had
arrived
by
post
that
morning
delia
frittered
her
time
shamelessly
esther
was
guilty
of
writing
surreptitious
messages
to
joan
upon
the
edges
of
her
chalk
copy
of
apollo
and
irene
usually
interested
in
her
work
had
a
fit
of
the
fidgets
the
moment
the
bell
sounded
and
the
class
was
dismissed
they
bundled
their
pencils
into
their
boxes
and
left
the
studio
with
almost
indecent
haste
only
an
hour
and
a
half
altogether
for
our
stunt
does
leave
us
much
time
to
be
polite
remarked
aggie
smarting
under
a
rebuke
administered
by
miss
darrer
who
had
restrained
their
stampede
and
insisted
upon
an
orderly
retreat
it
all
very
well
for
people
to
saunter
elegantly
when
they
nothing
particular
to
do
i
dare
say
the
italians
look
dignified
but
we
ca
stalk
about
as
if
we
were
perpetually
carrying
on
our
heads
american
girls
have
more
energy
than
that
i
just
ready
to
fly
to
bits
declared
delia
prancing
down
the
passage
like
a
playful
kitten
i
give
everybody
five
minutes
to
get
on
their
costumes
decreed
jess
peachy
must
stay
outside
in
the
passage
and
wait
i
tinkle
my
swiss
when
you
all
to
come
in
peachy
pulling
a
long
face
of
protest
took
her
stand
obediently
in
the
corridor
while
her
three
roommates
entered
dormitory
their
fancy
dresses
were
lying
ready
on
their
beds
and
they
whisked
into
them
with
the
utmost
haste
there
is
my
cap
on
straight
jess
you
look
fine
i
guess
we
keep
the
crowd
waiting
we
earn
our
livings
as
artistes
any
day
is
that
elvira
oh
thanks
put
the
teapot
down
there
please
what
a
huge
plate
of
bread
and
butter
we
never
eat
it
mary
if
you
ready
you
might
be
uncovering
the
grub
the
girls
had
laid
everything
in
preparation
for
their
feast
and
to
protect
their
dainties
from
flies
had
put
sheets
of
tissue
paper
over
the
table
mary
lifted
these
deftly
but
as
she
removed
them
her
smug
satisfaction
changed
to
a
howl
of
dismay
instead
of
the
tempting
dainties
which
they
had
placed
there
with
their
own
hands
stood
a
circle
of
bricks
and
stones
for
a
moment
all
three
gazed
blankly
at
the
awful
sight
then
they
found
speech
our
beautiful
cakes
where
are
they
who
done
this
oh
the
who
been
in
how
they
wherever
have
they
put
them
have
they
eaten
them
oh
what
a
shame
what
we
to
do
it
was
indeed
a
desperate
situation
for
loud
thumps
at
the
door
proclaimed
the
advent
of
the
visitors
who
seemed
likely
to
be
provided
with
a
decidedly
barmecide
feast
delia
however
had
an
inspiration
she
stooped
on
hands
and
knees
and
foraged
under
the
beds
announcing
by
a
jubilant
screech
that
she
had
discovered
the
lost
property
it
did
not
take
long
to
move
away
the
stones
and
to
transfer
the
plates
from
the
floor
to
the
table
after
which
three
much
flustered
hostesses
opened
the
door
and
gushed
a
welcome
to
their
guests
it
was
rather
a
motley
group
who
entered
irene
as
a
nun
in
waterproof
and
hood
agnes
as
a
red
cross
nurse
esther
a
turk
with
a
towel
for
a
turban
joan
a
sportsman
in
her
gymnasium
knickers
sheila
in
a
tricolor
cap
represented
france
and
lorna
was
draped
with
the
union
jack
jess
with
a
plaid
arranged
as
a
kilt
made
a
sturdy
highlander
mary
was
an
irish
colleen
while
delia
in
a
wrapper
ornamental
with
fringes
of
tissue
paper
stood
for
carnival
a
white
dressing
jacket
trimmed
with
green
leaves
and
a
garland
of
flowers
were
waiting
for
peachy
and
when
the
latter
was
popped
on
her
head
she
was
promptly
proclaimed
queen
o
the
may
very
much
flattered
by
these
preparations
in
her
honor
the
guest
of
the
occasion
took
her
place
at
the
table
i
absolutely
astounded
she
announced
where
did
you
get
all
this
spread
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
antonio
was
to
go
and
buy
it
it
too
topping
for
words
we
thought
it
had
gone
out
of
the
window
a
moment
ago
said
jess
explaining
their
horrible
predicament
as
she
wielded
the
teapot
the
camellia
buds
listened
aghast
somebody
had
evidently
been
playing
a
shameful
trick
upon
them
it
mabel
or
bertha
no
no
they
have
taken
the
cakes
quite
away
instead
of
only
hiding
them
then
it
must
be
winnie
or
ruth
quite
likely
they
knew
we
were
having
the
party
the
wretches
we
pay
them
out
afterwards
what
a
mean
thing
to
do
they
were
honest
at
any
rate
and
did
take
so
much
as
a
biscuit
they
have
heard
about
it
if
they
had
well
that
ends
well
and
we
better
clear
the
dishes
while
we
can
have
another
piece
of
iced
sandwich
mary
no
thanks
i
really
do
want
any
more
the
camellia
buds
having
disposed
of
the
feast
and
having
yet
half
an
hour
of
the
birthday
party
left
on
their
hands
decided
to
hold
what
they
called
a
mixed
recitation
stunt
they
sat
in
a
circle
on
the
floor
and
counted
out
till
the
lot
fell
upon
one
of
them
whose
pleasing
duty
it
became
to
act
entertainer
for
the
next
five
minutes
when
she
was
entitled
to
hand
the
part
on
to
somebody
else
fate
aided
perhaps
by
a
little
gentle
maneuvering
gave
the
first
turn
to
jess
i
adore
poetry
but
i
never
can
remember
it
by
heart
she
protested
so
do
expect
me
to
a
piece
please
no
i
not
trying
to
get
out
of
it
i
do
my
bit
the
same
as
everybody
else
stop
giggling
and
listen
because
i
going
to
tell
you
something
spooky
it
a
real
highland
story
it
happened
to
an
aunt
of
mine
are
you
ready
well
then
be
quiet
because
i
going
to
begin
i
have
an
aunt
who
lives
in
the
highlands
her
name
is
jessie
yes
i
named
after
her
some
of
her
family

had
the
gift
of
second
sight
but
not
all
of
them
her
grandmother
had
it
very
strongly
and
used
to
foretell
the
strangest
things
and
they
always
came
true
aunt
jessie
was
a
seventh
child
that
always
supposed
to
give
people
the
power
of
seeing
visions
if
she
been
the
seventh
child
a
seventh
child
then
she
have
been
a
wife
and
foreseen
the
future
but
she
was
that
exactly
she
came
very
near
to
it
once
though
and
that
what
i
want
to
tell
you
about
uncle
gordon
was
going
to
london
and
the
day
before
he
started
auntie
was
sitting
alone
in
the
garden
she
had
been
very
well
so
she
was
just
leaning
back
in
a
resting
she
was
asleep
she
was
looking
at
the
view
and
thinking
how
lovely
it
all
was
she
could
see
right
across
the
moor
and
down
the
valley
where
the
river
ran
the
heather
was
in
blossom
and
it
was
a
glorious
sight
suddenly
it
seemed
as
if
everything
became
blurred
and
dark
as
if
a
mist
were
before
her
eyes
a
patch
cleared
through
the
midst
of
this
and
she
could
see
the
valley
below
as
if
she
were
looking
through
an
enormous
telescope
the
river
had
burst
its
banks
and
was
flowing
all
over
the
line
and
through
the
flood
came
the
train
and
dashed
into
the
water
she
saw
this
vision
only
for
a
moment
then
it
passed
she
rubbed
her
eyes
and
wondered
if
it
was
a
dream
she
decided
it
was
a
warning
she
very
superstitious
most
highland
people
are
she
did
want
uncle
gordon
to
go
next
day
by
the
little
train
that
ran
down
the
valley
but
she
knew
if
she
told
him
her
he
would
only
laugh
at
her
so
she
pretended
she
wanted
to
do
some
shopping
at
aberfylde
a
town
fifteen
miles
away
where
the
local
railway
joins
the
main
line
she
told
uncle
gordon
that
if
they
motored
there
together
she
could
see
him
off
on
the
london
express
and
then
have
a
day
shopping
so
he
agreed
and
they
went
in
the
car
there
was
a
tremendous
storm
in
the
night
and
it
was
still
raining
when
they
started
auntie
spent
the
day
in
aberfylde
and
motored
back
and
when
she
reached
home
she
noticed
the
valley
had
turned
into
a
lake
the
terrific
rain
had
swollen
all
the
streams
and
made
the
river
burst
its
banks
and
the
line
was
flooded
and
it
was
impossible
for
the
train
to
run
so
her
really
did
come
true
after
all
she
ever
so
proud
of
it
and
wrote
it
all
down
so
that
she
should
forget
it
that
my
story
now
it
somebody
stunt
let
count
out
again
fortune
cast
the
lot
this
time
on
agnes
who
wrinkled
up
her
forehead
and
protested
she
did
know
anything
to
tell
but
when
urged
remembered
something
she
had
heard
during
the
summer
holidays
it
true
too
she
assured
them
we
were
staying
at
tarana
we
had
a
villa
there
water
was
very
scarce
and
we
used
to
have
two
barrels
of
it
brought
every
day
on
donkeyback
by
a
woman
whose
business
it
was
to
act
as
carrier
her
name
was
luigia
and
she
was
very
picturesque
looking
and
had
the
most
beautiful
dark
eyes
though
she
always
looked
fearfully
sad
daddy
is
fond
of
sketching
and
he
painted
a
picture
of
her
standing
with
her
donkey
under
the
vines
we
guessed
somehow
that
she
had
a
history
and
we
asked
sareda
our
cook
about
her
sareda
knew
everybody
in
the
place
she
was
a
dear
old
gossip
she
got
quite
excited
over
luigia
story
she
said
it
had
been
the
talk
of
tarana
at
the
time
luigia
used
to
be
a
lovely
girl
when
she
was
young
and
she
was
quite
wealthy
for
a
peasant
because
she
owned
a
little
lemon
grove
on
the
hillside
she
inherited
it
from
her
father
who
was
dead
of
course
because
she
was
beautiful
and
a
village
heiress
she
soon
found
a
sweetheart
and
became
engaged
to
francesco
a
fisherman
who
lived
down
on
the
marina
everything
was
going
on
very
happily
and
the
wedding
was
fixed
when
suddenly
it
was
found
there
was
something
wrong
with
luigia
glorious
eyes
she
went
to
a
doctor
in
naples
and
he
told
her
that
unless
a
certain
operation
were
performed
she
would
go
blind
if
she
went
to
paris
to
a
specialist
whom
he
named
her
sight
might
be
saved
poor
luigia
sold
her
lemon
grove
in
a
hurry
to
get
the
necessary
money
and
packed
up
and
started
for
paris
immediately
she
was
away
six
months
and
she
came
back
penniless
but
seeing
as
well
as
ever
she
trudged
all
the
way
from
liparo
to
tarana
along
the
coast
road
because
she
could
not
afford
to
take
the
train
when
she
walked
into
her
own
village
the
first
thing
she
saw
was
a
wedding
party
leaving
the
church
she
stopped
to
watch
and
as
the
procession
passed
her
who
should
the
bridegroom
prove
to
be
but
her
own
faithless
sweetheart
francesco
she
screamed
and
fainted
and
some
kindly
neighbors
took
her
in
and
cared
for
her
she
got
work
afterwards
in
the
village
but
she
did
not
find
a
husband
because
her
lemon
grove
was
sold
and
these
peasants
will
not
marry
a
wife
without
a
dowry
no
wonder
she
looked
so
sad
we
were
always
frightfully
sorry
for
her
sheila
who
was
the
next
entertainer
recited
a
ballad
and
delia
also
spoke
a
piece
an
amusing
episode
of
child
life
which
she
rendered
with
much
humor
the
next
turn
was
irene
and
the
girls
who
were
in
a
mood
for
listening
clamored
for
a
story
i
have
any
or
original
adventures
she
declared
my
aunts
never
have
psychic
experiences
and
the
people
who
brought
us
things
to
the
door
in
london
were
interesting
in
the
least
if
you
like
romance
though
i
remember
a
tale
in
a
little
old
old
book
that
belonged
to
my
great
grandmother
it
was
supposed
to
be
true
and
i
dare
say
it
may
have
really
happened
more
than
a
hundred
years
ago
just
as
babes
in
the
wood
really
happened
in
norfolk
in
elizabethan
times
it
about
a
girl
named
mary
howard
her
father
and
mother
died
when
she
was
only
four
years
old
and
she
was
left
an
orphan
she
was
heiress
to
a
very
great
property
and
her
uncle
john
howard
was
made
her
guardian
she
also
had
another
uncle
dallas
her
mother
brother
but
he
lived
in
calcutta
and
she
had
never
seen
him
john
howard
wished
to
get
hold
of
mary
estates
for
himself
so
he
laid
a
careful
plot
first
he
sent
all
the
servants
away
including
her
nurse
betty
morris
who
was
devoted
to
her
betty
offered
to
stay
on
without
wages
but
when
this
was
refused
she
became
suspicious
and
wrote
a
letter
to
dallas
warning
him
to
look
after
his
sister
child
but
it
took
many
months
in
those
days
for
a
letter
to
get
to
calcutta
and
meantime
howard
was
pursuing
a
wicked
scheme
soon
afterwards
betty
heard
that
her
charge
had
been
stolen
by
gypsies
for
the
sake
of
her
amber
beads
and
could
not
be
found
anywhere
what
had
really
happened
was
worse
even
than
betty
had
feared
howard
had
hired
a
sailor
who
was
in
desperate
need
of
money
and
bribed
him
to
decoy
the
child
away
take
her
to
the
seaside
and
there
drown
her
robert
the
sailor
fulfilled
the
first
part
of
his
bargain
but
not
the
second
he
carried
little
mary
into
a
remote
part
of
wales
but
he
did
not
do
her
any
harm
instead
he
became
extremely
fond
of
her
and
determined
to
save
her
from
her
uncle
so
he
bought
a
passage
in
a
vessel
bound
for
new
zealand
and
took
her
to
sea
with
him
pretending
she
was
his
daughter
she
was
a
sweet
gentle
little
creature
and
soon
became
a
favorite
on
board
among
the
crew
was
a
maori
boy
named
duaterra
whose
father
was
a
great
chief
in
new
zealand
the
captain
for
some
offense
ordered
this
boy
to
be
flogged
and
duaterra
could
not
forgive
the
indignity
he
planned
a
terrible
revenge
when
they
reached
new
zealand
he
persuaded
the
captain
and
crew
to
land
in
his
father
territory
then
summoning
his
savage
friends
he
ordered
a
general
massacre
and
killed
them
all
saving
only
robert
and
little
mary
robert
had
been
good
to
him
and
had
given
him
tobacco
and
duaterra
adored
mary
and
called
her
his
mocking
bird
the
maoris
plundered
and
burnt
the
ship
after
they
had
murdered
the
crew
but
they
were
kind
to
robert
and
mary
and
built
a
native
house
for
them
here
they
lived
for
four
years
for
they
had
no
opportunity
to
escape
robert
married
the
chief
daughter
and
settled
down
as
a
member
of
the
tribe
but
he
became
very
anxious
about
little
mary
he
knew
that
duaterra
looked
upon
her
as
his
prospective
bride
and
he
could
not
bear
to
think
of
the
lovely
child
ever
becoming
the
wife
of
a
savage
one
day
a
marvelous
opportunity
occurred
for
sending
mary
home
a
ship
put
in
to
obtain
fresh
water
and
on
the
vessel
happened
to
be
an
old
friend
of
robert
named
john
morris
actually
the
brother
of
betty
morris
mary
former
nurse
robert
told
john
the
whole
story
and
begged
him
to
take
the
little
girl
to
england
and
deliver
her
into
hands
he
paid
for
her
passage
with
the
money
which
howard
had
given
him
as
a
bribe
and
which
as
he
could
not
use
money
in
new
zealand
he
had
kept
buried
in
the
ground
mary
was
carried
on
board
ship
when
she
was
fast
asleep
at
night
and
poor
robert
cried
like
a
child
at
parting
from
her
john
morris
proved
a
faithful
friend
he
took
mary
to
london
and
sent
a
message
to
his
sister
betty
who
was
then
living
in
devonshire
when
she
arrived
she
was
able
to
identify
her
nursling
and
to
tell
john
that
dallas
had
arrived
from
calcutta
and
had
offered
a
large
reward
for
the
recovery
of
his
niece
so
mary
was
placed
under
the
guardianship
of
her
mother
brother
who
took
good
care
both
of
her
and
her
estates
and
the
wicked
uncle
was
so
overcome
with
shame
when
the
story
of
his
crime
got
about
that
he
went
crazy
and
ended
his
days
in
a
lunatic
asylum
and
the
best
place
for
him
too
commented
jess
he
must
have
been
a
brute
i
dare
say
things
like
that
really
happen
before
there
were
daily
papers
to
publish
photos
of
lost
children
and
when
the
maoris
in
new
zealand
were
still
savages
look
here
my
hearties
do
you
realize
it
we
got
exactly
ten
minutes
to
clear
up
before
rachel
arrives
on
the
rampage
gracious
help
me
out
of
these
duds
rachel
would
never
let
me
hear
the
end
of
it
if
she
caught
me
as
a
may
queen
i
know
her
sarcastic
tongue
squealed
peachy
thanks
just
fifty
thousand
times
for
my
birthday
party
it
been
absolutely
prime
and
i
never
enjoyed
anything
as
much
for
years
sorry
to
send
you
others
into
the
cold
cold
world
but
i
afraid
you
have
to
scoot
and
change
chapter
xvi
concerning
juniors
though
all
the
camellia
buds
had
keenly
enjoyed
peachy
birthday
festivities
they
were
none
of
them
satisfied
to
allow
the
mystery
of
the
hiding
of
their
cakes
to
remain
unsolved
they
questioned
elsie
who
was
often
an
envoy
between
themselves
and
the
rest
of
the
transition
but
elsie
professed
utter
ignorance
and
assured
them
that
the
particular
girls
whom
they
suspected
had
been
playing
tennis
during
the
whole
of
their
recreation
and
could
not
possibly
have
had
time
or
opportunity
to
enter
dormitory
unnoticed
by
some
of
their
companions
we
have
seen
them
declared
elsie
besides
they
have
boasted
about
it
whoever
the
trick
was
it
was
ours
if
you
want
my
opinion
i
should
say
ask
some
of
those
juniors
they
absolute
imps
and
ready
for
anything
this
was
quite
a
new
view
of
the
case
the
camellia
buds
had
fixed
the
mischief
so
certainly
on
the
rival
sorority
that
they
had
never
thought
of
the
younger
girls
peachy
catching
olive
doris
and
natalie
the
trio
whom
she
had
named
her
triplets
taxed
them
solemnly
with
the
crime
they
burst
out
laughing
we
you
neatly
were
you
all
this
time
guessing
it
was
us
i
expect
you
had
a
hunt
for
those
cakes
peachy
focussed
a
stern
eye
upon
their
giggling
faces
and
hypnotized
them
into
attention
now
what
mean
by
such
impudence
how
dare
you
go
into
our
dormitory
juniors
are
to
play
tricks
on
their
seniors
that
was
bumped
into
my
head
when
i
was
a
kid
and
i
bump
it
jolly
well
into
yours
the
trio
pouted
we
thought
you
called
yourself
our
fairy
godmother
said
olive
sulkily
well
so
i
do
not
much
fairy
about
it
or
godmother
either
you
do
nothing
for
us
now
you
ungrateful
little
wretches
have
we
settled
bertha
and
mabel
for
you
do
you
get
your
biscuits
all
right
at
lunch
now
oh
yes
but
but
what
you
have
given
us
a
candy
party
for
ages
broke
out
natalie
you
keep
all
your
cakes
and
fun
to
yourselves
you
promised
us
all
sorts
of
things
we
do
think
fairy
godmothers
are
any
use
snorted
olive
ta
ta
we
off
to
a
some
people
make
a
mighty
palaver
over
next
to
nothing
sneered
doris
as
the
trio
linked
arms
and
tore
away
peachy
stood
looking
after
them
with
wrinkled
brows
she
was
a
peppery
little
person
and
her
temper
was
up
for
the
moment
all
the
same
doris
parting
shot
struck
home
unfortunately
it
was
true
the
camellia
buds
had
proclaimed
themselves
as
fairy
godmothers
limited
had
adopted
juniors
with
much
flourish
of
trumpets
had
certainly
fought
a
crusade
and
defended
them
against
injustice
and
infringement
of
their
rights
and
then
and
then
alack
in
the
excitement
of
other
matters
had
almost
forgotten
all
about
them
peachy
remembered
clearly
that
for
the
first
week
of
her
championship
she
had
made
a
point
of
speaking
daily
to
olive
doris
and
natalie
now
for
a
full
fortnight
she
had
scarcely
nodded
to
them
at
the
breakfast
table
they
had
certainly
had
no
opportunity
of
pouring
their
childish
woes
into
the
sympathetic
and
motherly
ear
which
she
had
quite
intended
should
be
always
open
to
them
i
a
wretched
memory
she
ruminated
remorsefully
poor
kiddies
they
really
got
rather
a
grievance
though
they
need
have
been
so
cheeky
the
young
imps
i
guess
i
better
call
a
meeting
of
the
camellia
buds
and
see
what
to
be
done
i
do
believe
any
of
us
have
taken
any
notice
of
them
just
lately
nine
philanthropists
reminded
of
past
schemes
of
benevolence
blushed
uneasily
and
tried
to
revive
interest
in
their
protégées
they
always
seemed
very
busy
with
and
other
things
and
not
exactly
hankering
after
us
urged
agnes
in
excuse
they
could
have
come
to
us
if
they
wanted
of
course
added
mary
that
was
entirely
the
pact
said
peachy
driving
in
her
tacks
with
firm
hammer
we
offered
to
them
and
then
forgot
all
about
them
no
wonder
they
think
us
frauds
what
to
be
done
about
it
get
some
more
cakes
somehow
and
ask
them
all
to
a
party
suggested
irene
enthusiastically
we
have
been
pigs
i
promised
désirée
to
paint
something
in
her
album
and
the
book
been
in
my
drawer
for
weeks
and
i
never
touched
it
how
are
we
going
to
get
the
cakes
wheedle
antonio
again
i
suppose
we
need
have
any
ourselves
if
there
are
two
slices
apiece
for
the
kids
it
will
do
we
must
keep
some
of
our
biscuits
from
lunch
so
that
we
can
seem
to
be
eating
something
ourselves
peachy
you
can
coax
him
you
always
leave
it
to
me
antonio
is
so
easy
to
manage
sometimes
he
an
absolute
pharisee
and
wo
buy
me
so
much
as
a
single
bit
of
candy
i
do
what
i
can
those
poor
kids
shall
have
a
treat
if
it
costs
me
my
last
dollar
we
owe
them
something
decent
antonio
whose
lapses
from
duty
were
only
occasional
and
who
had
been
reprimanded
lately
by
miss
rodgers
who
suspected
his
delinquencies
proved
deaf
on
this
occasion
to
peachy
blandishments
he
protested
with
quite
aggravating
virtue
that
it
was
as
much
as
his
place
was
worth
to
smuggle
even
a
solitary
and
that
for
the
future
he
must
no
more
be
the
conveyor
of
contraband
sweet
stuff
stumped
in
that
quarter
mourned
peachy
but
i
not
going
to
let
this
beat
me
i
been
cultivating
a
friendship
with
the
cook
laugh
i
thought
it
might
come
in
useful
some
day
i
gave
her
my
blue
butterfly
brooch
i
had
two
of
them
and
i
took
a
of
her
in
her
sunday
clothes
and
she
was
immensely
pleased
and
flattered
i
have
developed
it
yet
by
the
by
but
i
will
and
print
her
two
copies
and
mount
them
if
that
does
melt
her
heart
into
sparing
me
a
little
butter
and
sugar
it
ought
to
we
can
square
it
this
way
none
of
us
ten
must
eat
any
butter
or
sugar
at
breakfast
or
tea
then
we
have
a
real
right
to
have
it
given
us
afterwards
do
pull
faces
you
can
have
marmalade
or
jam
what
sybarites
you
are
agreed
the
camellia
buds
sorrowfully
accepting
the
sacrifice
but
could
the
juniors
contribute
some
butter
too
added
sheila
it
might
be
noticed
if
too
many
went
without
besides
it
the
hostesses
who
ought
to
provide
the
party
not
the
guests
benedicta
the
cook
was
vulnerable
especially
in
view
of
the
exercised
by
the
heroic
ten
she
made
a
hasty
calculation
of
the
amount
of
butter
they
would
normally
have
consumed
added
a
package
of
sugar
and
lent
them
a
pan
and
a
spoon
peachy
carried
away
these
spoils
chuckling
and
hid
them
carefully
behind
the
then
she
racked
her
brains
and
composed
what
she
considered
a
suitable
and
telling
invitation
to
all
who
love
a
fairy
fête
i
beg
you
come
and
do
be
late
we
offer
fun
that
will
not
wait
the
time
is
fixed
for
four
you
have
to
squat
upon
the
floor
we
ask
you
all
but
ca
do
more
our
is
small
but
handy
indeed
we
think
the
place
most
dandy
we
going
to
try
and
make
you
candy
so
leave
your
game
of
and
come
and
make
a
friendly
call
you
find
a
welcome
for
you
all
from
your
fairy
godmothers
peachy
wrote
her
effusion
upon
a
sheet
torn
from
her
best
pad
folded
it
sought
out
olive
and
handed
it
to
her
telling
her
to
pass
it
round
the
form
the
juniors
grinned
at
its
contents
they
had
felt
themselves
neglected
but
were
quite
ready
to
forgive
past
omissions
on
the
strength
of
a
present
invitation
better
late
than
never
decreed
doris
i
suppose
we
go
it
sounds
as
if
it
might
be
rather
nice
agreed
the
others
so
once
more
the
camellia
buds
were
placed
in
the
position
of
hostesses
owing
to
the
difficulty
of
the
catering
they
judged
it
best
to
make
the
candy
before
the
very
eyes
of
their
guests
so
that
they
might
see
for
themselves
how
little
there
was
of
it
and
not
grouse
if
the
supply
only
ran
to
one
bit
apiece
otherwise
they
might
think
we
had
first
go
and
only
given
them
the
leavings
remarked
peachy
who
was
a
born
diplomat
they
had
counted
on
borrowing
the
which
the
seniors
used
for
brewing
their
coffee
but
at
the
last
moment
they
found
the
bottle
of
methylated
spirit
was
empty
what
a
nuisance
there
no
time
to
send
for
more
never
mind
we
be
let
light
a
and
cook
on
that
we
must
manage
somehow
we
certainly
ca
disappoint
them
not
after
all
this
fuss
the
back
of
the
as
being
a
particularly
retired
and
secluded
spot
was
chosen
as
the
rendezvous
and
when
the
nineteen
juniors
interested
and
appreciative
came
fluttering
up
the
garden
they
were
met
by
scouts
conducted
round
commanded
to
squat
in
a
circle
on
the
ground
and
requested
to
make
less
noise
want
the
whole
of
the
school
to
butt
in
warned
jess
then
keep
quiet
ca
you
much
taffy
you
get
if
rachel
catches
us
your
only
chance
is
to
lie
low
you
little
sillies
rachel
playing
tennis
giggled
evelyn
carr
there
are
other
prefects
as
well
as
rachel
pull
yourselves
together
and
do
get
so
excited
the
juniors
who
had
been
talking
at
the
top
of
their
voices
squealing
and
otherwise
raising
the
echoes
restrained
their
transports
and
contented
themselves
with
whispers
and
giggles
the
camellia
buds
were
fetching
fuel
which
they
had
purloined
from
the
gardener
they
commenced
to
build
a
before
very
long
the
flames
were
dancing
up
now
the
hostesses
in
their
enthusiasm
to
be
hospitable
had
foolishly
forgotten
that
it
is
one
thing
to
stir
a
pan
over
a
methylated
spirit
lamp
and
quite
another
to
hold
it
over
a
peachy
agnes
and
mary
tried
in
turns
and
scorched
their
hands
egged
on
by
the
interested
circle
watching
their
performance
make
a
big
bonfire
and
let
it
die
down
and
put
the
pan
in
the
hot
ashes
just
as
we
cook
chestnuts
proposed
irene
it
was
at
least
a
feasible
suggestion
anything
seemed
better
than
open
failure
before
those
nineteen
pairs
of
expectant
eyes
volunteers
went
off
for
fresh
supplies
of
wood
which
was
soon
crackling
merrily
but
alas
the
camellia
buds
being
rather
overwrought
and
flustered
with
their
experiments
did
not
calculate
on
the
fact
that
the
smoke
of
their
bonfire
would
give
away
their
secret
rachel
had
handed
her
tennis
racket
to
phyllis
and
was
taking
a
turn
among
the
orange
trees
to
try
to
memorize
her
recitation
for
the
elocution
class
the
world
a
stage
and
all
the
men
and
women
merely
players
they
have
their
exits
and
their
entrances
and
one
man
in
his
time
plays
many
parts
she
repeated
then
catching
sight
of
the
gray
cloud
rising
from
the
back
of
the
hello
what
giovanni
burning
he
set
those
orange
trees
on
fire
if
he
does
mind
abandoning
shakespeare
rachel
stalked
away
to
investigate
and
surprised
the
candy
party
by
a
sudden
appearance
in
their
midst
good
gracious
girls
whatever
are
you
doing
here
she
demanded
in
idiomatic
if
hardly
strictly
classical
english
at
the
unwelcome
sight
of
the
head
prefect
the
juniors
one
and
all
simply
stampeded
and
i
regret
to
say
that
the
more
timid
of
the
camellia
buds
followed
their
example
peachy
irene
lorna
delia
and
jess
stood
their
ground
however
we
we
were
only
giving
those
kids
a
little
fun
answered
peachy
in
dead
silence
rachel
reviewed
the
pan
its
contents
and
the
blushing
faces
before
her
then
she
said
rather
dangerous
fun
if
that
tree
catches
it
will
set
the
in
a
blaze
next
you
know
your
fire
drill
well
each
fetch
a
bucket
of
water
and
put
this
out
right
turn
quick
march
at
the
words
of
command
the
luckless
five
fled
to
the
house
and
into
the
back
hall
where
the
fire
buckets
were
kept
they
returned
with
what
speed
they
could
and
thoroughly
soused
their
bonfire
rachel
assured
herself
that
it
was
safely
out
then
commenced
further
inquiries
we
did
mean
any
harm
explained
peachy
much
on
the
defensive
we
were
only
trying
to
amuse
those
juniors
they
never
have
a
chance
to
get
hold
of
the
tennis
courts
and
they
tired
of
eternal
and
they
rather
a
thin
time
of
it
we
started
taking
them
up
because
they
were
so
bullied
bertha
and
mabel
used
to
snatch
their
biscuits
away
from
them
at
lunch
rachel
face
was
a
study
bertha
and
mabel
snatched
their
biscuits
she
repeated
yes
we
stopped
that
though
never
saw
it
they
took
jolly
good
care
you
should
why
did
you
come
and
tell
peachy
looked
embarrassed
well
if
you
really
want
to
know
she
blurted
out
you
so
aloof
and
superior
nobody
cares
to
come
and
tell
you
anything
we
managed
it
by
ourselves
rachel
winced
as
if
peachy
had
struck
her
a
blow
i
sorry
if
if
that
how
i
seem
to
you
she
faltered
i
must
have
failed
utterly
as
head
girl
if
you
ca
confide
in
me
the
prefects
want
to
be
the
friends
of
all
the
school
peachy
shrugged
her
shoulders
eloquently
i
do
quite
see
where
the
friendship
comes
in
she
murmured
you
bag
the
best
tennis
courts
and
have
the
best
dormitories
and
give
your
own
stunts
there
you
never
ask
any
of
us
to
them
do
you
now
no
i
afraid
we
do
admitted
rachel
still
in
the
same
constrained
almost
bewildered
manner
we
really
never
thought
of
it
the
four
camellia
buds
listening
to
their
friend
outspoken
comments
expected
an
explosion
of
wrath
from
the
head
prefect
but
rachel
only
told
them
to
take
the
buckets
back
to
the
house
and
that
too
she
added
pointing
to
the
pan
peachy
stooped
and
picked
it
up
turned
to
go
then
delivered
herself
of
a
last
manifesto
it
our
own
butter
and
sugar
that
we
saved
from
breakfast
and
tea
so
please
do
blame
anybody
else
i
blame
myself
most
whispered
rachel
as
she
was
left
alone
the
immediate
result
of
the
incident
was
a
prefects
meeting
at
which
the
head
girl
full
of
compunction
stated
the
facts
of
the
case
to
her
fellow
officers
we
thought
we
were
doing
our
duty
but
it
is
enough
just
to
act
as
police
she
urged
those
girls
in
the
transition
were
on
the
right
track
in
getting
hold
of
the
juniors
though
perhaps
they
did
it
in
the
wrong
way
this
school
is
really
united
we
all
divided
up
into
our
own
sororities
and
we
not
doing
enough
for
one
another
got
to
alter
it
somehow
or
confess
ourselves
failures
do
any
of
us
seniors
really
the
little
ones
i
sure
i
do
yet
we
ought
to
be
elder
sisters
to
them
that
the
real
function
of
prefects
not
just
to
help
to
keep
order
do
you
agree
sybil
erica
phyllis
and
stella
were
conscientious
girls
and
when
the
matter
was
thus
stated
they
saw
it
from
rachel
new
point
of
view
they
were
ready
and
willing
to
talk
over
plans
they
decided
amongst
other
developments
that
with
miss
morley
permission
they
would
invite
the
juniors
in
relays
to
dormitory
teas
in
order
to
win
their
confidence
and
establish
more
friendly
relations
with
them
the
transition
were
also
to
be
cultivated
and
their
opinion
asked
on
the
subject
of
festivities
and
other
school
affairs
about
which
the
prefects
had
never
before
deigned
to
consult
them
the
altered
attitude
promised
a
far
more
healthy
and
satisfactory
state
and
miss
morley
to
whom
rachel
hinted
some
of
their
reasons
for
offering
hospitality
readily
agreed
and
allowed
the
juniors
to
be
entertained
with
cakes
and
tea
upon
the
veranda
the
seniors
gave
us
a
simply
time
confided
désirée
to
irene
afterwards
we
cream
puffs
and
almond
biscuits
and
preserved
ginger
and
we
played
games
for
prizes
but
do
think
we
liked
it
any
better
than
your
candy
parties
the
prefects
are
awfully
kind
to
us
now
but
it
was
you
who
took
us
up
we
ca
forget
chapter
xvii
the
league
there
was
an
old
established
custom
at
the
villa
camellia
that
on
the
evening
of
the
last
day
of
march
unless
that
date
happened
to
fall
on
a
sunday
the
pupils
were
allowed
special
license
after
supper
and
regardless
of
ordinary
rules
might
disport
themselves
as
they
pleased
until
bedtime
irene
who
had
not
yet
been
present
on
one
of
these
occasions
heard
hints
on
all
sides
of
coming
fun
mingled
with
mystery
peachy
twice
began
to
tell
her
something
but
was
stopped
by
delia
joan
and
sheila
seemed
to
be
holding
perpetual
private
committee
meetings
elsie
spent
much
time
in
jess
cameron
dormitory
and
wonder
of
wonders
esther
cartmell
was
seen
walking
arm
in
arm
with
mabel
hughes
though
irene
asked
many
questions
from
various
friends
as
to
the
nature
of
the
evening
amusement
she
could
get
no
certain
information
they
laughed
evaded
direct
answers
made
allusions
to
things
she
did
not
understand
and
whisked
away
like
very
much
puzzled
and
not
altogether
pleased
she
sought
her
buddy
they
all
gone
mad
she
assured
lorna
i
ca
get
a
word
of
sense
out
of
peachy
esther
was
almost
nasty
and
jess
shut
the
door
in
my
face
what
the
matter
with
them
have
i
developed
spots
or
a
squint
why
have
i
suddenly
become
a
leper
lorna
who
was
busy
with
french
translation
shut
her
dictionary
with
a
bang
i
no
patience
with
them
she
groused
it
because
you
english
i
suppose
we
shall
have
to
get
up
a
stunt
of
our
own
just
out
of
retaliation
but
i
sick
of
the
whole
business
what
you
mean
why
it
become
a
sort
of
custom
to
make
this
a
nationality
night
the
american
girls
all
band
together
and
so
do
the
south
africans
and
the
australians
and
the
scotch
girls
are
a
clique
of
their
own
they
play
jokes
on
every
one
else
and
sometimes
it
almost
gets
to
fighting
between
the
sororities
sororities
are
forgotten
for
the
time
being
your
dearest
chum
in
the
camellia
buds
will
turn
against
you
if
it
a
question
of
scotch
or
english
or
american
or
british
i
advise
you
to
put
away
everything
you
value
the
south
africans
came
into
my
cubicle
last
year
and
smeared
my
cold
cream
over
my
pillow
of
course
your
bed
will
be
filled
with
brushes
and
boots
and
any
hard
oddments
they
can
find
lying
about
you
wo
be
able
to
find
anything
in
the
morning
the
place
is
an
absolute
muddle
how
horrid
yes
it
is
horrid
i
ca
see
the
fun
of
it
myself
practical
jokes
can
go
too
far
in
my
opinion
and
some
of
those
juniors
get
so
rough
they
hurt
each
other
i
keep
out
of
it
only
it
wise
to
stay
and
defend
your
own
cubicle
or
you
find
your
blanket
hidden
and
your
soap
gone
do
the
seniors
join
in
no
they
barricade
themselves
in
their
bedrooms
and
have
some
private
fun
but
they
leave
us
to
do
as
we
like
it
the
transition
and
juniors
who
play
the
tricks
of
course
the
seniors
must
know
what
going
on
because
they
used
to
do
the
same
themselves
but
they
just
shut
their
eyes
oh
said
irene
thoughtfully
and
because
a
thing
has
always
been
must
it
always
be
ca
it
ever
be
altered
are
we
to
do
nothing
but
play
tricks
on
the
last
night
of
march
it
ought
to
be
altered
i
a
jolly
good
mind
to
go
to
rachel
and
tell
her
my
views
about
it
she
been
much
nicer
lately
than
she
used
to
be
perhaps
she
listen
if
she
does
there
be
no
harm
done
at
any
rate
will
you
come
with
me
i
do
like
going
by
my
little
lonesome
the
two
girls
tapped
at
the
door
of
dormitory
and
fortunately
found
the
head
prefect
within
and
alone
she
received
them
quite
graciously
and
listened
with
interest
to
what
lorna
had
to
say
i
so
thankful
you
told
me
she
said
in
reply
i
agree
with
you
absolutely
it
time
this
silly
business
was
put
a
stop
to
we
prefects
have
held
back
because
we
did
want
to
be
but
i
believe
you
really
voice
the
opinion
of
a
good
many
girls
i
used
to
get
very
tired
of
it
when
i
was
in
the
transition
myself
if
miss
rodgers
found
out
some
of
the
tricks
that
are
played
she
never
let
us
have
the
holiday
again
ca
we
persuade
them
to
do
something
else
instead
something
really
jolly
we
must
i
think
about
it
leave
it
to
me
i
been
turning
it
over
in
my
mind
for
some
time
though
my
ideas
never
crystallized
i
have
some
scheme
ready
i
can
depend
on
you
two
to
support
me
in
the
transition
rather
rachel
reporting
the
interview
to
her
fellow
prefects
found
them
entirely
in
agreement
they
were
dissatisfied
with
many
things
in
the
transition
and
junior
forms
and
this
nationality
evening
was
considered
the
limit
something
seemed
to
be
needed
at
the
present
crisis
to
weld
together
the
various
factions
of
the
villa
camellia
and
turn
them
into
one
harmonious
whole
the
prefects
were
aware
that
the
various
sororities
were
really
rival
societies
and
that
though
they
might
give
great
fun
and
enjoyment
to
their
respective
members
they
were
productive
of
jealousy
rather
than
union
we
want
a
common
motive
said
rachel
an
inspiration
if
possible
i
believe
some
sort
of
a
league
would
do
it
something
outside
ourselves
and
bigger
than
just
the
little
world
of
school
something
that
even
the
smallest
juniors
could
join
and
in
which
girls
who
have
left
could
still
take
an
interest
it
dawning
on
me
i
believe
i
got
it
going
to
call
it
league
we
get
everybody
to
join
and
fix
its
first
festival
for
the
of
march
it
should
just
take
the
wind
out
of
those
silly
nationality
tricks
i
speak
to
miss
rodgers
and
ask
her
to
let
us
have
a
parade
and
dance
with
prizes
for
the
best
costumes
they
love
that
anyhow
i
call
a
meeting
in
the
gym
and
put
it
to
them
i
believe
it
will
catch
on
the
pupils
at
the
villa
camellia
were
not
overdone
with
public
meetings
they
responded
therefore
with
alacrity
to
the
notice
which
rachel
after
obtaining
the
necessary
permission
from
the
authorities
pinned
upon
the
board
in
the
hall
they
were
all
a
little
curious
to
know
what
she
wanted
to
talk
to
them
about
a
few
anticipated
a
scolding
but
the
majority
expected
some
more
pleasant
announcement
rachel
wrought
up
but
she
does
look
like
jawing
us
was
the
verdict
of
peachy
who
had
passed
the
head
prefect
in
the
corridor
some
of
the
seniors
constituted
themselves
stewards
and
arranged
the
audience
to
their
satisfaction
with
juniors
on
the
front
benches
and
the
transition
behind
when
everybody
was
seated
rachel
stepped
on
to
the
platform
and
rang
the
bell
for
silence
her
cheeks
were
pink
with
excitement
and
there
was
a
little
thrill
of
nervousness
in
her
voice
as
if
she
were
forcing
herself
to
a
supreme
effort
but
this
passed
as
she
warmed
to
her
subject
girls
she
began
i
asked
you
to
come
here
because
i
want
to
have
a
talk
with
you
about
our
school
life
you
all
agree
with
me
that
we
love
the
villa
camellia
it
a
unique
school
i
do
suppose
another
exactly
like
it
in
the
whole
world
why
it
so
peculiar
is
that
we
a
set
of
girls
in
the
midst
of
a
country
we
ourselves
are
collected
from
different
continents
some
are
americans
some
english
some
from
australia
or
new
zealand
or
south
africa
but
we
all
talk
the
same
tongue
and
we
bound
together
by
the
same
race
traditions
large
schools
in
england
or
america
take
a
great
pride
in
their
foundation
and
they
play
other
schools
at
games
and
record
their
victories
we
ca
do
that
here
because
there
are
no
foreign
teams
worth
challenging
so
we
always
had
to
be
our
own
rivals
and
have
form
matches
in
a
way
it
has
been
altogether
good
for
us
we
got
into
the
bad
habit
of
thinking
of
the
school
in
sections
instead
of
as
one
united
whole
i
even
heard
squabbles
among
you
as
to
whether
california
or
cape
colony
or
new
south
wales
are
the
most
places
to
live
in
now
instead
of
scrapping
we
ought
to
be
glad
to
join
hands
if
you
think
of
it
it
a
tremendous
advantage
to
grow
up
among
girls
from
other
countries
and
hear
their
views
about
things
it
ought
to
keep
you
from
being
narrow
at
any
rate
you
get
fresh
ideas
and
rub
your
corners
off
what
i
want
you
particularly
to
think
about
is
this
it
the
duty
of
all
people
to
cling
together
if
they
ever
had
any
differences
it
time
they
forgot
them
the
world
seems
to
be
in
the
at
present
and
there
are
many
strange
prophecies
about
the
future
black
and
yellow
races
are
increasing
and
growing
so
rapidly
that
they
may
be
ready
to
brim
over
their
boundaries
some
day
and
swamp
the
white
civilizations
ought
to
be
prepared
and
to
stand
hand
in
hand
to
help
one
another
i
been
reading
some
queer
things
lately
one
is
that
a
new
continent
is
slowly
rising
out
of
the
pacific
ocean
lemuria
they
call
it
and
some
day
hundreds
of
years
hence
there
may
be
land
there
instead
of
water
and
people
living
on
it
they
say
too
that
the
center
of
gravity
of
both
the
british
empire
and
the
united
states
is
moving
towards
the
pacific
sydney
may
grow
more
important
than
london
and
san
francisco
than
new
york
when
the
trade
routes
make
them
fresh
pivots
of
energy
another
funny
thing
i
read
is
that
as
the
world
is
changing
a
new
race
seems
to
be
emerging
travelers
say
that
the
modern
children
in
australia
do
look
in
the
least
like
english
children
or
french
children
or
any
european
nation
they
are
a
fresh
type
america
has
been
populated
by
people
from
practically
all
the
older
countries
but
i
read
that
children
who
are
being
born
there
now
differ
in
their
head
measurements
from
babies
of
the
older
races
perhaps
some
of
you
may
be
interested
in
this
and
some
of
you
may
only
be
bored
but
what
i
want
to
rub
in
is
that
if
a
new
and
perhaps
superior
race
is
evolving
it
surely
part
of
our
work
to
help
it
on
here
we
all
are
girls
from
england
america
and
the
british
colonies
of
the
same
race
and
speaking
the
same
language
let
us
make
an
league
and
pledge
ourselves
that
wherever
we
go
over
the
face
of
the
world
we
will
carry
with
us
the
best
traditions
we
out
for
peace
not
war
and
peace
comes
through
sympathy
the
women
of
those
great
eastern
nations
the
chinese
the
japanese
and
the
hindoos
who
are
only
just
awakening
to
a
sense
of
freedom
will
look
to
us
westerners
for
their
example
ca
we
hold
out
the
hand
of
sisterhood
to
them
and
teach
them
our
highest
ideals
so
that
in
the
centuries
to
come
they
may
be
our
friends
instead
of
our
enemies
it
a
case
of
up
the
white
man
burden
we
stand
together
not
as
scotch
or
canadians
or
new
zealanders
or
americans
but
as
good
the
apostles
of
peace
not
i
going
to
ask
every
girl
in
this
room
to
join
the
league
be
various
activities
in
connection
with
it
we
have
decided
all
yet
but
we
hope
one
of
them
will
be
to
establish
a
correspondence
between
this
school
and
other
schools
in
england
and
the
colonies
and
in
america
we
like
to
write
letters
to
their
prefects
and
hear
what
they
are
doing
and
have
copies
of
their
school
magazines
it
would
be
like
shaking
hands
over
the
ocean
then
why
should
we
correspond
with
girls
in
missionary
schools
in
india
or
china
or
japan
think
how
exciting
to
have
letters
from
them
and
read
them
aloud
we
should
hear
all
about
their
eastern
lives
and
all
kinds
of
interesting
things
well
these
are
schemes
yet
that
need
a
little
time
to
establish
i
something
much
nearer
to
put
before
you
miss
rodgers
has
given
us
seniors
leave
to
hold
a
dance
on
the
of
march
from
to
here
in
the
gym
we
invite
every
girl
who
joins
the
league
to
come
nationality
costumes
will
be
welcomed
there
will
be
first
second
and
third
prizes
for
the
best
dresses
the
judges
will
take
into
consideration
the
scantiness
of
the
materials
available
but
they
wish
to
announce
that
any
girl
found
guilty
of
borrowing
articles
for
her
costume
without
the
leave
of
their
owners
will
be
disqualified
and
further
that
any
member
of
the
league
convicted
of
playing
practical
jokes
will
be
expelled
from
the
dance
the
prefects
think
it
wise
and
necessary
to
mention
that
though
the
evening
of
march
has
been
set
aside
as
a
holiday
and
certain
rules
have
been
relaxed
the
school
is
nevertheless
bound
to
preserve
its
usual
code
of
good
manners
and
every
girl
is
put
on
her
honor
to
behave
herself
sure
i
need
not
say
more
for
you
surely
understand
me
and
agree
that
when
miss
rodgers
has
allowed
us
to
have
this
fun
we
ought
not
to
abuse
her
kindness
will
every
one
who
ready
to
join
the
league
and
wants
to
come
to
the
dance
hold
up
her
hand
almost
every
girl
in
the
room
responded
to
rachel
invitation
some
the
ones
were
attracted
by
the
ideals
of
the
league
itself
others
were
merely
anxious
not
to
be
left
out
of
the
festivities
it
was
a
long
time
since
the
school
had
had
a
fancy
ball
there
had
been
private
carnivals
in
the
dormitories
but
not
a
public
official
affair
at
which
everybody
could
compete
in
the
way
of
dresses
rumor
spread
like
round
the
room
it
was
whispered
that
miss
morley
herself
meant
to
come
disguised
as
hiawatha
that
miss
rodgers
had
offered
a
gold
as
first
prize
and
that
there
were
yards
of
gorgeous
materials
in
the
storeroom
to
be
had
for
the
asking
the
thrill
of
these
manifold
possibilities
was
sufficient
to
eclipse
the
attractions
of
their
former
intentions
for
the
evening
amusement
it
was
really
more
interesting
to
evolve
costumes
than
plan
tricks
every
true
daughter
of
eve
loves
to
look
her
best
and
womanhood
even
in
the
bud
can
not
withstand
the
supreme
magnet
of
clothes
little
doris
parker
south
african
hoyden
as
she
was
voiced
the
general
feeling
when
she
confessed
i
meant
to
give
those
australians
a
hot
time
of
it
they
may
thank
their
stars
for
the
league
though
i
rather
glad
i
sha
have
to
tease
natalie
because
she
my
chum
we
both
going
together
as
southern
hemispheres
it
be
ripping
fun
the
camellia
buds
who
had
been
temporarily
estranged
by
the
impending
national
divisions
returned
to
the
friendly
atmosphere
of
their
sorority
and
lent
one
another
garments
for
the
fête
it
a
good
thing
rachel
put
a
stopper
on
commandeering
commented
delia
mabel
was
simply
shameless
at
the
carnival
had
anybody
told
sybil
and
erica
knew
and
rachel
is
really
as
blind
as
we
thought
at
any
rate
she
awake
now
and
a
far
nicer
prefect
than
she
used
to
be
by
the
by

to
draw
lots
as
to
who
may
borrow
out
of
the
theatrical
property

oh
goody
i
hope
i
win
there

the

comes
my

thank

you

what
i
call

i
share
my
last

the
contents
of
miss
morley
theatrical
property
box
apportioned
strictly
by
lot
did
not
go
far
among
girls
miss
rodgers
allowed
two
of
the
prefects
with
a
teacher
to
make
an
expedition
into
fossato
and
rummage
the
shops
for
some
yards
of
cheap
gay
materials
imitation
lace
and
bright
ribbons
which
they
were
commissioned
to
buy
on
behalf
of
certain
of
their
schoolfellows
but
most
of
the
dancers
had
to
contrive
their
costumes
out
of
just
anything
that
came
to
hand
often
exercising
an
ingenuity
that
was
little
short
of
marvelous
acting
upon
rachel
suggestion
many
of
them
personified
various
continents
or
countries
the
stars
and
stripes
of
the
american
flag
were
conspicuous
and
there
were
several
red
indians
with
painted
faces
and
feathers
in
their
hair
sheila
mary
esther
and
lorna
repeated
the
costumes
they
had
worn
at
the
tableau
and
went
as
representatives
of
canada
south
africa
india
and
new
zealand
but
peachy
lent
her
cowboy
costume
to
rosamonde
and
turned
up
as
longfellow
evangeline
in
gray
puritan
robe
and
neat
white
cap
a
part
which
though
very
becoming
did
not
accord
with
her
mischievous
twinkling
eyes
not
much
maiden
about
you

delia
why
not
asked
peachy
calmly
i
guess
poor
evangeline
was
always
on
the
weep
no
doubt
she
had
her
lively
moments
sometimes
i
showing
her
at
her
brightest
and
best
you
ought
to
give
thanks
for
a
new
interpretation
of
her

tremendously
by
robing
in

good

kangaroo
girls
arrayed
fantastically
in
all
the
colors
of
the
rainbow
made
a
delectable
sight
as
they
paraded
round
the
gymnasium
the
prefects
had
shirked
the
difficult
and
delicate
task
of
judging
and
had
called
in
miss
rodgers
and
miss
morley
to
decree
who
were
to
receive
the
prizes
perhaps
they
also
found
the
decision
too
hard
for
they
chose
a
dozen
of
the
best
put
them
to
the
public
vote
and
counted
the

the
gold
wristlet
watch
was
of
course
a
myth
and
the
rewards
were
mere
trifles
but
the
principals
had
risen
to
the
occasion
sufficiently
to
contribute
to
the
entertainment
by
providing
lemonade
between
the
dances
which
in
the
opinion
of
the
girls
was
a
great
addition
to
the
festivities
and
made
the
event
seem
more
like
a
real
party
before
they
separated
the
league
formed
an
enormous
circle
round
the
room
and
each
clasping
her
neighbor
hand
all
joined
in
the
singing

roared
the
familiar
chorus

having
thus
worked

dormitories
and
went
to

without
breaking
their
pledge
of
good
behavior
rachel
returning
from
her
round
of
supervision
heaved
a
sigh
of
immense
relief
i
was
dreading
this
evening
she
confided
to
sybil
i
was
so
afraid
they
forget
their
promises
and
begin
that
rowdy
teasing
i
believe
we
broken
the
tradition
of
that
thank
goodness
i
hope
it
may
never
be
revived
again
thanks
to
the
league
and
may
go
on
and
flourish
long
after
have
left

the
opening
of

at
the
villa
camellia
bearing
as
it
did
missives
from
most
quarters
of
the
globe
was
naturally
a
great
daily
event
some
of
the
girls
were
lucky
in
the
matter
of
correspondence
peachy
received
numerous
letters
and
others
were
not
so
highly
favored
poor
lorna
was
generally
left
out
altogether
her
father
wrote
to
her
occasionally
but
she
had
no
other
friend
or
relation
to
send
her
even
a
she
accepted
the
omission
with
the
sad
patience
which
was
her
marked
characteristic
her
affection
for
irene
had
been
an
immense
factor
in
her
school
life

but
she
was
still
very
different
from
other

kept
her
old
barrier
of
shy
reserve

were

referred

lorna
had
only
been
languidly
polite
over
them
but
later
she
grew
interested
articles
may
not
be
as
good
as
your
own
but
they
are
better
than
nothing
at
all

the
various

sorted
out
any
which
she
might
hand
on
to
her
chum
not
home
letters
yours
are
sacred
mummie
darling
and
she
care
to
hear
about
aunt
doreen
attack
of
rheumatism
there
are
two
she
may
like
and
this
lovely
long
stave
from
dona
lorna
dear
i
told
you
about
my
cousin
dona
anderson
she
at
brackenfield
college
she
older
than
i
am
but
somehow
we
always
been
such
friends
i
like
her
far
and
away
the
best
out
of
that
family
she
does
find
time
to
write
very
often
because
she
in
the
sixth
and
a
prefect
and
it
keeps
her
busy
and
besides
she
never
has
been
much
of
a
scribbler
i
have
heard
from
her
for
months
this
is
ever
such
a
jolly
letter
though
if
you
care
to
look
at
it
thanks
said
lorna
accepting
the
offer
yes
i
remember
you
told
me
about
her
she
must
be
rather
a
sport
i
wish
she
were
at
the
villa
camellia
instead
of
in
england
and
dona
thinks
there
is
any
other
school
in
the
world
except
hers
but
lorna
had
opened
the
sheets
and
was
already
reading
as
follows
githa
brackenfield
college
march
renie
dear
i
been
meaning
to
write
to
you
for
ages
mother
told
me
the
news
of
how
you
all
packed
off
to
naples
and
she
sent
me
the
address
of
your
school
i
do
hope
you
like
it
and
have
settled
down
i
always
wanted
you
to
come
to
brackenfield
you
know
joan
is
here
now
it
her
first
term
and
radiantly
happy
she
a
clever
little
person
at
her
work
and
we
think
she
going
to
be
great
at
games
of
course
she
only
in
new
girls
junior
team
but
she
done
splendidly
already
ailsa
was
looking
on
yesterday
and
complimented
her
afterwards
we
had
quite
a
good
hockey
season
the
coll
played
hawthornden
last
week
and
when
the
whistle
went
for
time
the
score
was
in
our
favor
an
immense
triumph
for
us
because
never
had
the
luck
to
beat
them
before
and
we
were
feeling
desperate
about
it
they
were
so
of
winning
too
do
you
get
any
hockey
at
fossato
or
is
it
all
tennis
we
a
rather
decent
gymnastic
display
a
while
ago
mona
and
beatrice
are
very
keen
on
gym
practice
and
they
did
some
really
neat
on
the
bars
also
side
vaulting
the
juniors
gave
country
dances
in
costume
and
of
course
that
sort
of
thing
is
always
clapped
by
parents
we
working
hard
now
for
the
concert
ailsa
and
i
have
to
sing
a
duet
and
we
both
terrified
hope
we
sha
break
down
and
spoil
the
show
i
enjoying
this
year
at
brackenfield
most
immensely
it
lovely
being
a
prefect
i
was
fearfully
scared
when
first
the
empress
sent
for
me
and
told
me
i
was
to
be
a
school
officer
but
got
on
swimmingly
thanks
largely
to
ailsa
i
think
of
course
we
still
inseparable
we
always
have
been
since
our
first
term
at
ethelberta
when
i
smuggled
the
mice
into
no
to
scare
mona
out
of
the
dormitory
and
leave
room
for
ailsa
i
go
nearly
every
week
to
the
tamarisks
it
cheers
auntie
up
to
see
me
she
rather
lonely
since
elaine
was
married
by
the
by
you
asked
me
what
had
become
of
miss
norton
little
nephew
eric
you
admired
his
photograph
so
much
with
those
lovely
golden
curls
of
course
they
cut
off
now
ever
so
much
stronger
and
has
gone
to
a
preparatory
school
i
still
send
him
books
and
things
and
he
writes
me
sweet
letters
i
planning
to
coax
mother
to
let
me
invite
nortie
to
bring
him
to
us
for
part
of
the
summer
holidays
i
do
want
to
lose
sight
of
the
dear
little
chap
now
for
home
news
leonard
is
in
india
and
likes
the
life
there
and
larry
is
at
cambridge
peter
and
cyril
are
still
at
bede
and
getting
on
well
their
letters
are
full
of
nothing
but
football
though
nora
baby
girl
is
a
darling
and
michael
is
still
very
sweet
though
he
growing
rather
an
imp
you
know
we
always
describe
ourselves
as
an
rambling
family
well
one
of
us
is
rambling
in
your
direction
marjorie
is
making
a
tour
in
italy
with
some
friends
of
hers
the
prestons
is
she
lucky
the
last
she
sent
me
was
from
rome
and
she
said
they
were
going
on
to
naples
so
it
just
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
that
you
may
see
her
i
wish
i
could
have
come
out
for
easter
and
had
a
peep
at
you
i
like
to
see
oranges
really
growing
on
orange
trees
perhaps
ailsa
going
to
ask
me
for
the
holidays
though
they
have
a
country
cottage
in
cornwall
and
it
would
be
there
write
and
tell
me
about
your
southern
school
when
you
have
time
i
love
to
hear
do
you
have
to
speak
italian
there
well
i
must
stop
now
and
do
my
prep
there
a
junior
tapping
at
the
door
too
and
wanting
to
see
me
prefects
do
get
much
time
to
themselves
with
best
love
your
affectionate
coz
dona
anderson
what
a
jolly
letter
commented
lorna
as
she
handed
it
back
yes
dona
is
a
dear
i
used
to
want
to
go
to
brackenfield
but
i
well
last
year
and
mother
said
it
was
too
strenuous
a
school
for
me
is
it
a
joke
that
marjorie
is
in
italy
what
fun
if
she
were
to
turn
up
some
day
i
have
a
kind
of
feeling
that
i
going
to
see
her
getting
quite
excited
lorna
did
not
reply
irene
correspondence
was
after
all
only
a
matter
of
half
importance
to
her
indeed
the
thought
of
that
lively
family
of
cousins
brought
out
so
sharply
the
contrast
of
her
own
loneliness
that
she
almost
wished
she
had
never
heard
of
them
why
did
other
people
get
all
the
luck
in
life
what
the
matter
you
very
glum
said
irene
nothing
i
ca
always
be
sparkling
can
i
i
suppose
not
but
i
thought
you
be
interested
in
marjorie
coming
how
can
i
be
interested
in
some
one
i
never
seen
snapped
lorna
walking
abruptly
away
irene
looked
after
her
and
shook
her
head
i
put
my
foot
in
it
somehow
she
ruminated
you
never
know
how
to
take
lorna
a
thing
that
pleases
her
one
day
annoys
her
the
next
certainly
what
you
call
this
morning
it
was
getting
very
near
the
end
of
the
term
now
and
all
the
girls
were
talking
eagerly
about
going
home
before
they
separated
for
their
vacation
however
there
was
to
be
one
more
of
miss
morley
delightful
excursions
next
term
would
be
too
hot
to
do
much
sightseeing
so
those
of
the
pupils
who
had
not
yet
been
shown
the
wonders
of
the
neighborhood
were
to
have
the
chance
of
a
visit
to
the
greek
temples
at
pæstum
it
would
be
a
longer
expedition
even
than
to
vesuvius
and
as
many
were
anxious
to
take
part
it
was
arranged
to
hire
a
motor
to
accommodate
about
girls
and
several
teachers
the
lucky
ones
were
of
course
well
drilled
beforehand
in
the
history
and
architecture
of
the
place
and
knew
how
a
greek
colony
had
settled
there
about
the
year
and
had
built
the
magnificent
doric
temples
which
with
the
sole
exception
of
those
at
athens
are
the
finest
existing
ruins
of
the
kind
miss
rodgers
had
limited
the
excursion
to
seniors
and
transition
thinking
it
too
long
and
fatiguing
a
day
for
the
juniors
all
the
prefects
were
going
while
the
camellia
buds
with
the
exception
of
esther
and
mary
who
had
been
before
were
also
included
in
the
party
this
is
one
thing
you
would
get
at
any
rate
in
an
ordinary
english
school
said
lorna
i
do
suppose
the
brackenfield
girls
are
taking
excursions
to
greek
temples
there
are
any
greek
temples
in
england
for
them
to
go
and
see
silly
laughed
irene
well
abbeys
or
castles
or
anything
ancient
from
dona
accounts
that
sort
of
thing
is
not
in
their
line
they
concentrate
on
games
hockey
is
all
very
well
but
give
me
our
orange
groves
and
the
blue
sea
but
i
sometimes
hanker
for
a
really
hockey
match
do
you
like
the
villa
camellia
of
course
i
do
what
the
matter
lorna
i
believe
you
jealous
of
brackenfield
no
i
not
though
i
sure
i
right
in
fancying
you
rather
be
there
than
here
how
absurd
you
are
am
i
all
right
call
it
absurd
if
you
want
are
you
going
to
sit
next
to
me
in
the
irene
looked
conscious
i
promised
peachy
but
you
can
sit
the
other
side
you
know
oh
no
thanks
if
you
made
arrangements
already
i
sure
i
want
to
interfere
with
them
i
would
spoil
sport
for
worlds
you
are
the
limit
am
i
indeed
perhaps
you
rather
not
have
me
for
a
buddy
any
more
for
gracious
sake
stop
talking
nonsense
you
the
weirdest
girl
ever
met
snapped
irene
then
to
avoid
an
open
quarrel
she
walked
away
leaving
her
chum
in
the
depths
of
misery
lorna
knew
her
own
temper
was
at
fault
but
she
was
in
a
touchy
mood
and
laid
the
blame
on
fate
if
i
had
a
nice
home
like
other
girls
and
had
been
going
there
for
ripping
holidays
and
had
brothers
and
cousins
to
write
to
me
i
be
different
she
excused
herself
quite
forgetting
that
however
much
we
may
be
handicapped
the
molding
of
our
character
is
after
all
in
our
own
hands
as
it
was
she
sulked
and
when
the
arrived
although
irene
beckoned
her
to
a
place
beside
herself
and
peachy
she
took
no
notice
and
waited
till
everybody
else
had
scrambled
in
the
result
of
this
was
that
she
finally
found
herself
seated
away
from
all
her
own
friends
and
next
to
clark
the
wife
of
the
british
chaplain
who
by
miss
morley
invitation
had
joined
the
excursion
perhaps
on
the
whole
it
was
just
as
well
clark
was
what
the
girls
called
a
perfect
dear
and
a
few
hours
in
her
company
was
a
restful
mind
tonic
she
had
a
cheery
manner
and
chatted
upon
all
sorts
of
pleasant
subjects
so
that
after
a
time
lorna
began
to
forget
her
and
even
to
volunteer
a
remark
or
two
instead
of
confining
her
conversation
to
monosyllables
certainly
any
girl
must
have
been
hard
to
please
who
did
not
enjoy
herself
the
motor
drive
was
one
of
the
loveliest
in
italy
they
passed
through
glorious
scenery
all
the
more
beautiful
as
it
was
the
blossoming
time
of
the
year
and
flowers
were
everywhere
on
a
marshy
plain
as
they
reached
pæstum
the
fields
were
spangled
with
the
little
white
wild
narcissus
growing
in
such
tempting
quantities
that
miss
morley
asked
the
driver
to
stop
the
and
allowed
all
to
dismount
and
pick
to
their
hearts
content
is
the
scent
of
them
heavenly
said
lorna
burying
her
nose
in
a
bunch
of
sweetness
luscious
agreed
clark
i
think
the
old
greeks
must
have
gathered
these
to
weave
garlands
for
their
heads
when
they
went
to
their
festivals
i
glad
tourists
are
safe
here
now
this
marsh
just
where
we
standing
used
to
be
a
tremendous
haunt
of
brigands
and
any
travelers
coming
to
see
the
ruins
ran
the
chance
of
being
robbed
my
father
had
his
purse
taken
years
ago
do
look
frightened
the
government
have
put
all
that
down
at
last
the
neighborhood
of
naples
has
improved
very
much
since
i
was
a
girl
i
remember
pickpockets
used
to
be
quite
common
on
the
quay
at
santa
lucia
and
nobody
troubled
to
interfere
you
can
walk
to
the
boat
nowadays
and
carry
a
without
fearing
every
moment
it
will
be
snatched
but
the
driver
was
urging
the
necessity
of
pushing
on
so
all
took
their
seats
again
and
in
due
course
reached
pæstum
the
girls
had
of
course
seen
photographs
of
the
place
beforehand
yet
even
these
had
hardly
prepared
them
for
the
stately
magnificence
of
the
three
great
temples
that
suddenly
broke
upon
their
vision
their
immense
size
their
loneliness
far
from
town
or
city
and
their
glorious
situation
betwixt
hill
and
blue
sea
almost
took
the
breath
away
and
filled
the
mind
with
glowing
admiration
for
the
genius
of
greek
architecture
the
rows
of
fluted
doric
columns
tapering
symmetrically
towards
the
roof
were
like
beautiful
lily
stems
supporting
flowers
the
mellow
yellow
tone
of
the
stone
was
varied
by
the
ferns
and
acanthus
which
grew
everywhere
around
and
the
sunshine
falling
on
the
rows
of
delicate
shafts
seemed
to
linger
lovingly
and
invest
them
with
a
halo
of
golden
light
what
must
these
temples
have
been
when
the
world
was
young
said
miss
morley
if
we
could
only
get
a
glimpse
of
them
as
they
were
more
than
two
thousand
years
ago
think
what
processions
must
have
paced
down
those
glorious
aisles
priests
and
singers
and
worshipers
all
crowned
with
flowers
the
rose
gardens
of
pæstum
used
to
be
famous
among
the
roman
poets
the
marvel
is
that
the
stones
have
stood
all
these
centuries
of
time
it
seems
as
if
art
and
beauty
have
triumphed
over
decay
the
party
had
brought
lunch
baskets
and
they
now
sat
down
on
the
steps
of
the
temple
of
neptune
to
enjoy
their
picnic
fortunately
the
grounds
of
the
ruins
were
enclosed
by
railings
so
they
were
preserved
from
the
attentions
of
a
group
of
beggar
children
who
had
greeted
the
arrival
of
the
with
outstretched
palms
and
torrents
of
entreaties
for
soldi
and
who
were
hanging
about
the
gate
evidently
waiting
for
any
fresh
opportunity
that
might
occur
of
asking
alms
four
lean
and
hungry
dogs
however
had
managed
to
slip
into
the
enclosure
and
made
themselves
a
nuisance
by
sitting
in
front
of
the
picnickers
and
keeping
up
an
incessant
chorus
of
loud
barking
the
girls
tried
to
stop
the
noise
by
throwing
them
fragments
of
sandwiches
but
their
appetites
were
so
insatiable
that
they
would
have
consumed
the
whole
luncheon
and
have
barked
for
more
so
miss
morley
tired
of
the
noise
finally
chased
them
off
the
premises
with
her
umbrella
they
as
bad
as
wolves
and
as
for
the
children
they
shameless
they
been
taught
to
look
upon
tourists
as
their
prey
if
you
go
near
the
gate
dozens
of
little
hands
are
poked
through
the
railings
and
an
absolute
shriek
of
arises
it
spoils
people
enjoyment
to
be
so
terribly
pestered
by
beggars
and
the
more
you
give
them
the
more
they
ask
they
having
a
try
at
somebody
else
now
remarked
rachel
watching
the
crowd
of
small
heads
leave
their
vantage
ground
of
the
railings
and
surge
round
a
carriage
which
drove
up
some
other
tourists
are
coming
to
see
the
sights
two
gentlemen
and
three
ladies
very
glad
i
expect
to
show
their
tickets
and
get
through
the
gate
out
of
the
reach
of
that
rabble
they
walking
this
way
they
must
be
rather
annoyed
to
find
a
school
in
possession
of
the
place
the
strangers
also
carried
luncheon
baskets
and
seemed
seeking
a
spot
for
a
picnic
they
were
filing
past
the
group
on
the
steps
when
irene
suddenly
sprang
up
why
marjorie
marjorie
she
exclaimed
joyfully
do
you
know
me
the
handsome
girl
thus
addressed
looked
puzzled
for
a
moment
then
her
face
cleared
with
recognition
renie
you
grown
out
of
all
remembrance
to
think
of
meeting
you
here
of
all
places
i
with
some
friends
the
prestons
we
on
a
six
weeks
tour
in
italy
i
went
to
see
your
mother
in
naples
yesterday
what
a
jolly
flat
you
have
there
is
this
absolutely
glorious
having
the
time
of
my
life
i
should
think
you
are
by
the
look
of
you
laughed
irene
dona
wrote
and
told
me
you
were
coming
to
italy
but
i
never
expected
to
find
you
here
if
miss
morley
will
let
me
may
i
bring
my
lunch
along
and
join
your
party
for
a
little
while
there
are
ten
dozen
things
i
want
to
ask
you
of
course
come
and
share
our
sandwiches
we
plenty
to
spare
having
received
the
required
permission
irene
went
away
to
talk
to
her
cousin
considerably
to
the
admiration
of
most
of
her
chums
and
decidedly
to
the
envy
of
one
lorna
who
had
settled
herself
by
her
side
on
the
steps
was
not
pleased
to
be
deserted
she
could
never
quite
forgive
irene
for
having
so
many
friends
the
brooding
cloud
that
had
temporarily
dispersed
settled
down
again
when
the
girls
got
up
to
explore
the
temple
she
marched
glumly
away
by
herself
all
the
beauty
and
wonder
and
loveliness
of
the
scene
was
lost
upon
her
for
the
sake
of
a
foolish
fit
of
jealousy
she
was
spoiling
her
own
afternoon
she
was
sitting
upon
a
fallen
piece
of
masonry
very
wretched
and
indulging
in
a
private
little
weep
when
a
footstep
sounded
on
the
stone
pavement
and
somebody
came
and
sat
down
quietly
beside
her
it
was
clark
and
she
had
the
tact
to
take
no
notice
as
lorna
surreptitiously
rubbed
her
eyes
she
knew
far
more
about
the
girls
at
the
villa
camellia
than
any
of
them
suspected
and
she
had
a
very
shrewd
suspicion
what
lay
at
the
bottom
of
lorna
mind
a
skillful
remark
or
two
turned
the
conversation
on
to
the
topic
of
the
holidays
it
nice
to
go
home
is
it
lorna
gave
a
grunt
even
if
you
miss
your
friends
i
suppose
so
and
it
pleasant
to
think
they
may
miss
you
i
do
flatter
myself
they
do
that
burst
out
lorna
they
so
happy
they
never
think
about
clark
you
do
know
my
home
i
nobody
nobody
except
my
father
the
others
have
brothers
and
sisters
and
friends
and
all
they
want
and
i
have
nothing
except
your
father
added
clark
how
about
him
sometimes
when
two
people
are
left
lonely
they
can
make
the
world
blossom
again
for
one
another
is
it
time
you
began
to
take
your
mother
place
ca
you
set
yourself
these
holidays
to
give
him
such
a
bright
cheerful
daughter
that
he
hardly
want
to
part
with
you
when
you
go
back
to
school
would
you
rather
missed
you
than
your
chums
he
closer
to
you
than
they
are
ask
yourself
if
you
were
to
lose
him
is
there
one
of
your
friends
who
could
mean
as
much
to
you
i
sometimes
think
that
girls
who
are
brought
up
at
are
apt
to
lose
the
right
sense
of
value
of
their
own
relations
their
companions
and
the
games
fill
their
lives
and
they
go
back
for
the
holidays
almost
like
visitors
in
their
own
homes
when
they
leave
school
they
dissatisfied
and
restless
because
they
never
been
accustomed
to
suit
themselves
to
the
ways
of
the
household
and
have
no
niche
into
which
they
can
fit
the
old
round
of
is
over
and
they
have
been
trained
for
nothing
but
community
life
take
my
advice
and
make
your
niche
now
while
you
have
the
opportunity
show
your
father
you
want
him
and
that
he
your
best
friend
and
he
begin
to
realize
that
wants
how
old
are
you
nearly
sixteen
in
another
year
or
so
you
should
be
able
to
live
with
him
altogether
and
be
the
companion
to
him
that
he
needs
you
say
you
envy
girls
with
many
brothers
and
sisters
but
there
another
side
to
that
if
you
the
only
child
you
get
the
whole
of
the
love
remember
you
all
your
father
has
and
let
him
see
that
you
care
a
greater
thing
to
be
a
good
daughter
than
to
be
the
favorite
of
the
school
if
you
keep
that
object
in
view
you
ought
to
have
many
years
of
happiness
before
you
i
know
i
was
forgetting
that
side
of
it
said
lorna
slowly
think
it
over
then
for
its
worth
considering
a
woman
may
have
many
brothers
and
sisters
she
can
have
another
husband
or
another
child
but
it
only
one
father
or
mother
she
get
and
the
bond
is
a
close
one
is
that
irene
waving
to
us
what
is
she
calling
we
to
come
on
with
the
party
yes
indeed
we
ought
to
be
moving
along
we
shall
only
just
have
time
to
explore
the
other
temples
before
we
must
start
back
in
the
chapter
xix
in
capri
april
the
beautiful
april
of
southern
italy
was
spent
before
the
villa
camellia
broke
up
for
the
holidays
there
were
the
usual
examinations
at
which
distressed
damsels
with
agitated
minds
and
fingers
sat
at
desks
furnished
with
piles
of
foolscap
and
cudgeled
their
brains
to
supply
facts
to
fill
the
sheets
of
blank
paper
there
was
the
reading
out
of
results
with
congratulations
to
those
who
had
succeeded
and
glum
looks
from
miss
rodgers
to
those
who
had
failed
then
followed
the
bringing
down
of
boxes
the
joyful
flutter
of
packing
the
last
breakfast
and
the
final
universal
exodus
dear
old
thing
do
miss
me
a
little
hope
you
have
a
ripping
time
be
a
sport
and
write
to
me
wo
you
hold
me
down
somebody
i
ready
to
fizz
over
you
wo
forget
me
dearie
all
right
just
so
long
as
we
know
lorna
who
had
anticipated
previous
vacations
as
simply
a
relief
from
the
toil
of
lessons
went
home
to
naples
with
quite
altered
feelings
from
those
of
former
occasions
she
was
determined
that
if
it
possibly
lay
in
her
power
she
would
make
her
father
enjoy
the
time
she
spent
with
him
in
spite
of
injustice
and
cruel
wrong
there
might
surely
be
some
happy
hours
together
and
she
would
win
him
to
live
in
the
present
instead
of
continually
brooding
over
the
past
the
immense
terrible
pathos
of
the
situation
appealed
to
the
deepest
chords
in
her
nature
her
father
was
still
in
the
prime
of
his
years
a
handsome
clever
man
who
might
have
done
much
in
the
world
was
it
yet
too
late
lorna
sometimes
had
faint
budding
hopes
that
in
some
fresh
country
his
wrecked
career
might
be
righted
and
that
he
might
make
a
new
start
and
rise
triumphant
over
the
ruin
of
other
days
he
was
glad
to
see
her
there
was
no
doubt
about
that
the
knowledge
that
she
now
shared
his
secret
placed
her
on
a
different
footing
it
was
a
relief
to
him
to
have
some
one
in
whom
he
could
confide
some
one
who
knew
the
reason
for
his
hermit
mode
of
living
and
above
all
who
believed
in
his
innocence
insensibly
lorna
presence
acted
upon
him
for
good
the
nervous
hunted
look
began
to
fade
out
of
his
eyes
and
sometimes
he
actually
smiled
as
she
recounted
the
doings
of
the
camellia
buds
or
other
happenings
at
school
daddy
she
said
once
could
we
go
out
to
australia
or
america
or
somewhere
where
nobody
would
know
us
and
make
a
fresh
life
for
ourselves
a
gleam
of
hope
flitted
for
a
moment
over
the
sad
face
i
thought
of
that
lorna
perhaps
i
been
too
morbid
it
seemed
to
me
that
every
englishman
must
know
of
what
i
had
been
accused
and
i
had
no
credentials
to
offer
now
with
a
five
years
reference
from
the
ferroni
company
in
naples
i
might
have
a
chance
of
a
job
in
australia
it
worth
considering
for
your
sake
child
if
not
for
mine
during
the
whole
of
the
first
week
of
the
holidays
lorna
amused
herself
as
best
she
might
in
their
little
lodgings
in
naples
while
her
father
was
at
the
office
she
read
or
sewed
or
played
on
a
wretched
old
piano
which
had
little
tune
in
it
but
was
better
than
nothing
the
evenings
were
her
golden
times
for
then
they
would
go
out
together
sometimes
into
the
italian
quarters
of
the
city
or
sometimes
by
tram
into
the
suburbs
where
there
were
beautiful
promenades
with
views
of
the
sea
in
these
walks
she
grew
to
be
his
companion
and
instead
of
shrinking
from
him
as
in
former
days
she
met
him
on
a
new
footing
and
gave
him
of
her
best
together
they
planned
a
home
in
a
fresh
hemisphere
and
talked
hopefully
of
better
things
that
were
perhaps
in
store
for
them
over
the
ocean
and
so
life
went
on
and
father
and
daughter
might
have
realized
their
vision
and
have
emigrated
to
another
continent
where
no
one
knew
their
name
or
their
former
history
and
have
made
a
fresh
start
and
won
comparative
success
but
dame
fortune
who
sometimes
has
a
use
for
our
past
however
bitterly
she
seems
to
have
mismanaged
it
interfered
again
and
with
fateful
fingers
the
dice
it
certainly
did
not
seem
a
fortunate
circumstance
but
quite
the
reverse
when
the
grandchildren
of
their
landlady
who
occupied
the
above
their
rooms
sickened
with
measles
lorna
had
never
had
the
complaint
and
it
was
of
course
most
important
that
she
should
not
convey
germs
back
to
the
villa
camellia
so
it
was
a
vital
necessity
to
move
her
immediately
out
of
the
area
of
infection
signora
fiorenza
harassed
but
sympathetic
suggested
a
visit
to
capri
where
her
sister
signora
verdi
who
owned
a
little
orange
farm
and
had
a
couple
of
spare
bedrooms
would
probably
take
her
in
for
the
remainder
of
the
holidays
which
would
give
the
necessary
quarantine
before
returning
to
the
school
carson
jumped
at
the
opportunity
and
lorna
was
told
to
pack
her
bag
but
daddy
daddy
she
remonstrated
i
do
want
to
leave
you
just
when
we
happy
together
must
i
run
away
do
measles
matter
i
rather
have
them
and
stay
here
i
would
indeed
do
be
silly
lorna
miss
rodgers
would
thank
you
to
start
an
epidemic
of
course
you
must
go
to
capri
it
a
splendid
opportunity
signora
verdi
has
a
nice
little
villa
cheer
up
child
i
tell
you
what
i
do
i
take
you
myself
stay
over
sunday
and
come
again
and
spend
the
next
with
you
i
can
get
an
extra
day
or
two
of
holiday
if
i
want
and
the
casa
verdi
is
a
quiet
spot
quite
out
of
the
way
of
tourists
we
can
have
the
orange
groves
to
ourselves
and
see
nobody
if
i
catch
the
early
boat
i
not
likely
to
be
troubled
with
english
trippers
that
one
good
business
daddy
you
darling
oh
that
would
be
glorious
i
go
to
the
north
pole
if
you
come
too
two
with
you
in
capri
what
fun
have
the
time
of
our
lives
to
poor
lorna
who
so
seldom
had
the
opportunity
of
enjoying
family
outings
this
visit
indeed
was
an
event
she
packed
her
bag
joyously
and
was
all
excitement
to
start
following
his
usual
custom
of
avoiding
the
vicinity
of
english
people
carson
decided
not
to
go
to
capri
by
the
ordinary
steamer
that
conveyed
but
to
secure
passages
in
a
cargo
vessel
which
was
crossing
with
supplies
to
lorna
the
mode
of
conveyance
was
immaterial
she
would
have
sailed
cheerfully
on
a
raft
if
necessary
she
rather
enjoyed
the
picturesque
neapolitan
tramp
steamer
with
its
cargo
of
wine
barrels
and
packing
cases
and
its
crew
of
seamen
talking
and
gesticulating
with
all
the
excitability
of
their
southern
temperament
the
voyage
across
the
blue
bay
was
longer
than
that
to
fossato
and
she
sat
in
a
cozy
nook
among
the
casks
and
watched
first
the
white
houses
of
naples
fading
away
then
the
distant
mountains
of
the
coast
then
the
gay
sails
of
the
fishing
craft
that
plied
to
and
fro
over
the
water
it
was
sunset
when
they
reached
the
beautiful
island
of
capri
a
pink
ethereal
sunset
that
flooded
headland
and
rock
orange
orchard
and
vineyard
in
a
faint
and
luminous
opal
glow
their
vessel
anchored
outside
the
quay
of
the
marina
grande
and
signaled
for
a
boat
to
take
them
off
a
little
skiff
put
out
from
the
beach
and
into
this
they
and
their
luggage
were
transferred
the
transparent
crystal
water
over
which
they
rowed
was
clear
as
an
aquarium
and
alive
with
gorgeous
medusæ
whose
pink
tentacles
seemed
to
flash
with
the
colors
of
the
sunset
to
gaze
down
at
them
was
like
watching
a
flock
of
flitting
across
a
background
of
undulating
green
they
landed
at
the
jetty
walked
to
the
shore
and
after
securing
a
carriage
started
on
a
long
drive
uphill
to
the
of
signora
verdi
capri
betwixt
the
glow
of
the
fading
sunset
and
the
light
of
the
rising
full
moon
was
a
veritable
land
of
romance
with
its
domed
houses
set
in
a
mass
of
vines
and
lemon
trees
and
the
luscious
scent
of
its
many
flowers
wafted
on
the
evening
air
it
seemed
no
less
attractive
in
the
morning
when
after
drinking
their
coffee
in
a
arbor
that
stood
at
the
bottom
of
their
landlady
orange
grove
they
wandered
away
through
the
and
up
on
to
the
open
hillside
here
flora
had
surely
played
a
trick
to
plant
golden
genista
against
the
intense
sapphire
blue
of
a
capri
sea
and
she
must
have
emptied
her
apron
all
at
once
to
have
spangled
the
rough
grass
with
cistus
anemone
and
starry
asphodel
below
them
lay
a
stretch
of
rugged
rocks
and
turquoise
bay
with
no
sound
to
break
the
silence
but
the
tinkling
of
or
the
piping
of
a
little
boy
who
practiced
a
rustic
flute
as
he
minded
his
flock
to
poor
carson
wearied
with
the
noise
and
clamor
of
naples
it
was
a
veritable
paradise
a
haven
of
refuge
a
breathing
space
in
the
dreary
pilgrimage
of
his
sad
life
on
the
top
of
this
sunlit
islet
he
gained
a
short
period
of
peace
and
rest
before
he
once
more
shouldered
his
heavy
burden
if
i
could
live
all
my
days
here
lorna
who
knows
i
might
learn
to
forget
he
said
wistfully
oh
dad
we
must
find
a
way
out
somehow
you
ca
go
on
like
this
it
killing
you
why
have
we
to
suffer
under
this
unjust
accusation
why
should
some
one
else
do
a
shameful
deed
and
shift
the
blame
on
to
you
is
there
no
plan
by
which
you
could
clear
your
name
i
asked
myself
that
question
lorna
through
many
black
hours
but
i
never
hit
on
an
answer
i
hate
the
man
who
wronged
you
she
sobbed
passionately
yes
i
hate
him
hate
him
hate
him
and
all
belonging
to
him
is
it
wicked
to
hate
i
ca
help
it
when
it
my
own
father
honor
that
at
stake
oh
daddy
daddy
if
i
could
only
even
i
be
content
it
seems
so
hard
to
let
the
wicked
prosper
and
just
do
nothing
why
should
some
people
have
all
the
laughter
of
life
and
others
all
the
tears
lorna
parted
reluctantly
from
her
father
on
monday
morning
he
sailed
by
a
very
early
boat
so
that
the
sun
had
not
yet
risen
high
as
after
watching
his
vessel
leave
the
harbor
she
turned
from
the
marina
to
walk
back
to
the
casa
verdi
half
of
the
little
town
was
still
asleep
there
were
no
signs
of
life
in
the
hotel
where
the
wistaria
was
blooming
in
a
purple
shower
over
the
veranda
and
green
shutters
barred
the
lower
windows
of
most
of
the
villas
a
few
peasant
people
were
stirring
about
three
girls
as
straight
as
greek
goddesses
were
coming
down
the
steep
path
from
anacapri
with
orange
baskets
on
their
heads
and
their
hands
full
of
posies
of
pink
cyclamen
a
mother
with
a
child
clinging
to
her
skirt
was
taking
an
earthenware
pitcher
to
the
well
for
water
a
persistent
bell
in
the
little
church
of
costanzo
was
calling
some
to
prayers
and
others
were
starting
the
ordinary
routine
of
the
day
attending
to
animals
cutting
salads
in
their
gardens
spreading
out
or
getting
ready
the
hand
barrows
on
which
they
sold
their
wares
in
the
gleaming
morning
light
the
beautiful
island
seemed
more
than
ever
like
a
radiant
jewel
set
in
a
sapphire
sea
lorna
had
left
the
winding
highroad
and
was
taking
a
short
cut
up
flights
of
steep
steps
between
the
flowery
gardens
of
villas
where
geraniums
grew
like
weeds
and
every
bush
seemed
a
mass
of
scented
blossoms
she
was
passing
a
small
eastern
house
whose
gatepost
bore
the
attractive
title
of
la
carina
when
she
suddenly
heard
her
own
name
called
and
turning
round
startled
and
surprised
what
should
she
see
peeping
over
the
cactus
hedge
but
the
smiling
face
and
blonde
bobbed
locks
of
irene
the
amazement
was
mutual
hello
what
are
you
doing
in
capri
what
are
doing
here
i
staying
up
on
the
hill
and
we
staying
at
this
villa
to
think
of
meeting
you
sporting
is
it
come
inside
the
garden
i
ca
talk
to
you
down
there
in
the
road
that
her
chum
should
actually
also
have
come
to
capri
for
the
holidays
seemed
a
marvelous
piece
of
luck
to
lorna
we
decided
quite
in
a
hurry
explained
irene
dad
heard
this
little
place
was
to
let
furnished
and
took
it
for
three
weeks
the
camerons
have
taken
that
big
pink
house
over
there
with
the
umbrella
pine
in
the
garden
peachy
is
staying
with
them
is
it
absolutely
ripping
i
was
only
saying
yesterday
i
wished
you
were
here
too
and
my
cousin
marjorie
anderson
and
her
friends
are
stopping
at
the
hotel
just
down
below
we
having
the
most
glorious
times
all
together
here
vincent
vin
you
remember
meeting
lorna
at
school
she
actually
staying
in
capri
no
do
go
lorna
sit
down
and
talk
now
i
found
you
i
mean
to
keep
you
we
not
generally
up
so
early
but
dad
wants
to
catch
the
first
steamer
he
has
to
get
back
to
naples
this
morning
my
father
has
gone
already
by
a
sailing
vessel
then
you
are
alone
oh
i
say
you
must
spend
most
of
your
time
with
us
it
a
lucky
chance
that
has
blown
you
our
way
is
it
we
seem
quite
a
cluster
of
camellia
buds
in
capri
so
lorna
who
had
expected
a
very
quiet
not
to
say
dull
visit
at
the
casa
verdi
during
her
father
absence
found
herself
instead
in
the
midst
of
hospitable
friends
who
extended
cordial
invitations
to
her
for
every
occasion
by
all
means
let
your
friend
join
us
agreed
beverley
in
answer
to
her
daughter
urgent
request
we
heard
so
much
about
lorna
in
your
letters
she
seems
a
nice
girl
i
remember
i
was
quite
struck
with
her
when
i
saw
her
at
your
school
carnival
one
more
or
less
makes
no
difference
for
picnics
it
must
certainly
be
slow
for
her
up
there
with
only
an
italian
landlady
to
talk
to
poor
child
capri
was
an
idyllic
place
for
the
beautiful
climate
perfect
at
this
season
of
the
year
made
living
out
of
doors
a
delight
every
day
the
various
friends
met
together
and
either
went
for
excursions
or
passed
happy
hours
in
each
other
gardens
the
camerons
had
several
young
people
staying
with
them
as
well
as
peachy
and
the
party
at
the
hotel
proved
a
great
acquisition
this
consisted
of
captain
hilton
preston
and
his
sister
joyce
their
married
sister
kathleen
and
her
husband
frank
roper
and
marjorie
anderson
who
was
traveling
under
their
chaperonage
they
were
fond
of
the
sea
and
had
at
once
made
arrangements
to
hire
a
boat
and
a
boatman
for
their
visit
so
that
they
might
have
as
much
pleasure
as
possible
on
the
water
during
their
short
stay
we
sha
be
able
to
paddle
about
on
the
mediterranean
when
we
get
home
said
captain
preston
with
mock
tragedy
my
leave
will
soon
be
up
and
i
shall
be
off
to
india
again
it
a
case
of
enjoy
while
the
season
invites
us
these
rocks
and
bays
and
coves
are
simply
magnificent
we
decided
to
go
to
the
blue
grotto
who
cares
to
join
us
this
was
an
expedition
which
could
only
be
undertaken
when
the
sea
was
absolutely
calm
so
as
even
the
mediterranean
may
be
treacherous
and
sudden
squalls
can
lash
its
smooth
surface
into
waves
it
was
wise
to
take
advantage
of
a
cloudless
day
we
start
early
so
as
to
arrive
there
before
the
steamer
and
have
the
grotto
to
ourselves
instead
of
going
in
with
a
rabble
of
tourists
decreed
hilton
preston
four
boatfuls
of
us
will
be
a
big
enough
party
agreed
vincent
they
say
the
best
light
is
at
about
eleven
the
group
of
friends
therefore
set
off
from
the
marina
in
their
various
craft
the
row
along
the
base
of
the
precipitous
craggy
shore
was
most
beautiful
the
water
swarmed
with
and
and
on
the
rocks
at
the
edge
of
the
waves
grew
gorgeous
madrepores
and
other
frutti
di
mare
the
blue
grotto
is
one
of
the
wonders
of
italy
but
to
explore
it
is
not
a
particularly
easy
matter
for
its
entrance
is
scarcely
three
feet
in
height
my
have
we
got
to
squeeze
under
there
exclaimed
peachy
wonderingly
looking
at
the
tiny
space
at
the
foot
of
the
crag
through
which
they
would
be
obliged
to
pass
not
in
these
boats
of
course
said
vincent
the
skiffs
are
waiting
and
if
we
just
leave
it
to
the
boatmen
they
show
us
how
to
manage
the
tiny
craft
that
were
in
readiness
for
visitors
now
came
forward
and
the
party
was
transferred
to
them
three
passengers
were
taken
in
each
skiff
and
were
required
to
lie
flat
on
their
backs
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
the
boatman
paddled
to
the
entrance
of
the
grotto
then
also
lying
on
his
back
he
directed
the
skiff
into
a
low
passage
working
his
way
along
by
pulling
at
a
chain
which
was
fastened
to
the
roof
of
the
rocky
corridor
in
a
short
space
of
time
they
shot
into
an
enormous
cavern
feet
in
length
and
over
feet
in
height
here
for
a
moment
or
two
all
seemed
dazzled
but
as
their
bewildered
vision
gradually
grew
accustomed
to
the
light
they
saw
that
everything
in
the
grotto
walls
sea
or
any
objects
appeared
of
a
heavenly
blue
color
the
faces
of
their
friends
their
own
hands
the
water
when
they
scooped
it
up
and
dropped
it
again
all
were
turned
to
sapphire
while
articles
under
the
sea
gleamed
with
a
beautiful
silver
shade
the
girls
bared
their
arms
and
enjoyed
dipping
them
to
obtain
this
effect
the
glorious
blue
of
the
cave
was
indescribable
i
feel
like
a
mermaid
at
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
exulted
peachy
or
a
cherub
in
the
sky
said
jess
why
is
it
blue
though
asked
lorna
because
of
the
refraction
of
light
explained
beverley
from
the
next
boat
we
see
a
kind
of
concentrated
reflection
of
the
sky
sent
to
us
under
the
sea
if
it
were
a
gray
day
outside
it
would
be
gray
in
here
too
some
people
think
that
the
mediterranean
has
risen
and
that
once
the
water
in
this
grotto
was
much
lower
so
that
boats
could
sail
in
and
out
of
it
quite
easily
do
you
see
that
over
there
it
leads
to
some
broken
steps
and
a
passage
that
tradition
says
wound
up
through
the
cliff
right
to
the
villa
of
tiberius
perhaps
it
was
a
secret
way
by
which
he
thought
he
might
escape
if
danger
threatened
him
how
i
love
to
explore
it
sighed
irene
it
only
goes
a
little
way
before
it
is
blocked
it
hardly
worth
landing
to
look
at
it
be
careful
renie
if
you
lean
over
the
edge
of
the
boat
so
far
you
be
upsetting
us
and
although
we
might
look
very
delightful
and
silvery
objects
under
the
water
i
not
at
all
anxious
to
offer
myself
for
the
experiment
why
do
they
enlarge
the
entrance
asked
vincent
because
nobody
is
sure
whether
by
doing
so
they
might
or
might
not
spoil
the
beautiful
effect
of
blue
light
in
the
grotto
it
too
risky
a
venture
to
try
besides
in
present
conditions
the
boatmen
make
a
great
deal
of
money
by
taking
tourists
into
the
grotto
if
it
were
very
easy
to
get
in
they
could
not
charge
so
much
it
a
little
mine
of
wealth
to
the
capri
fisherfolk
now
though
years
ago
they
used
to
say
the
place
was
haunted
and
tell
terrible
tales
about
it
they
said
fire
and
smoke
had
been
seen
issuing
from
the
entrance
that
creatures
like
crocodiles
crept
in
and
out
that
every
day
the
opening
expanded
and
contracted
seven
times
that
at
night
the
sirens
sang
sweetly
there
that
any
young
fishermen
who
ventured
to
sail
near
disappeared
and
were
never
seen
again
and
that
the
place
was
full
of
human
bones
what
a
gruesome
record
declared
vincent
i
agree
with
renie
though
i
like
to
explore
that
passage
with
a
strong
bicycle
lamp
or
an
electric
torch
who
knows
what
we
might
find
if
we
looked
about
a
coin
that
tiberius
had
dropped
out
of
his
pocket
or
one
of
the
hairpins
or
a
crocodile
tooth
at
least
yes
i
must
positively
come
again
mater
just
to
prove
the
truth
of
your
stories
silly
boy
laughed
his
mother
i
expect
every
stone
of
the
place
has
been
well
turned
over
in
search
of
treasure
trust
the
fisher
people
not
to
lose
a
chance
now
our
stay
here
limited
by
the
official
tariff
to
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
if
we
stop
any
longer
we
shall
have
to
pay
our
dues
a
second
time
if
you
ready
so
am
i
tell
the
first
boat
to
go
on
do
forget
we
must
lie
on
our
backs
again
to
scrape
through
the
entrance
chapter
xx
the
cameron
clan
lorna
had
never
realized
before
how
much
of
life
can
be
compressed
into
a
few
days
the
interval
between
her
father
departure
for
naples
and
his
return
for
the
was
spent
almost
entirely
with
her
friends
it
marked
for
her
an
altogether
new
phase
of
existence
she
had
read
in
books
about
jolly
families
of
brothers
and
sisters
and
parties
of
young
people
but
her
own
experience
was
strictly
limited
to
school
here
in
capri
for
the
first
time
she
tasted
the
delights
of
which
she
had
often
dreamed
and
found
herself
cordially
included
in
a
charmed
circle
though
the
beverleys
were
mainly
responsible
for
thus
taking
her
up
the
camerons
also
offered
much
kindness
the
cameron
clan
as
they
called
themselves
consisted
of
father
mother
jess
and
two
brothers
angus
and
stewart
and
almost
every
evening
the
young
folk
would
meet
at
their
villa
and
gather
round
a
wood
fire
in
the
salon
though
the
days
were
so
warm
the
nights
were
chilly
and
it
was
cheerful
to
watch
the
blazing
logs
what
times
they
had
together
it
was
an
established
rule
that
everybody
contributed
some
item
to
the
general
entertainment
and
in
spite
of
fierce
denials
even
the
least
accomplished
were
compelled
to
perform
it
brought
out
quite
unexpected
talent
peachy
who
had
always
declared
her
music
was
up
to
anything
charmed
the
company
by
lilting
darkie
melodies
or
pathetic
indian
songs
captain
preston
remembered
conjuring
tricks
which
he
had
learned
in
india
roper
proved
a
genius
at
relating
short
stories
and
cameron
could
recite
old
ballads
with
the
fervor
of
a
medieval
minstrel
the
walls
of
the
italian
salon
seemed
to
melt
away
and
change
to
a
wild
moorland
or
a
northern
castle
as
she
declaimed
fair
helen
of
kirconnell
the
lament
of
the
border
widow
bartrum
dirge
or
the
braes
o
yarrow
modern
people
want
more
poetry
in
their
veins
she
insisted
i
no
patience
with
the
stuff
most
of
them
read
there
more
romance
in
one
of
those
stories
of
ancient
times
than
you
find
in
a
whole
boxful
of
the
latest
library
books
people
were
ashamed
of
their
feelings
then
and
they
put
them
into
beautiful
words
nowadays
it
seems
to
me
neither
the
feelings
nor
the
language
to
clothe
them
in
i
a
century
or
two
too
late
i
ought
to
have
lived
when
the
world
was
younger
if
his
wife
adored
her
native
ballads
cameron
on
his
part
had
a
good
stock
of
scottish
songs
and
would
trill
them
out
in
a
fine
baritone
voice
the
audience
joining
with
enthusiasm
in
the
choruses
of
such
favorites
as
bonny
dundee
charlie
is
my
darling
and
over
the
sea
to
skye
there
a
ring
about
jacobite
melodies
that
absolutely
grips
you
said
beverley
begging
for
wha
wad
na
fecht
for
charlie
and
farewell
manchester
perhaps
it
in
my
blood
for
my
ancestors
were
jacobites
one
of
them
was
a
beautiful
girl
in
and
sat
on
a
balcony
to
watch
her
prince
ride
into
faircaster
the
cavalcade
came
to
a
halt
under
her
window
and
looked
up
and
saw
her
and
asked
her
to
dance
at
the
ball
that
was
being
given
that
night
in
the
town
she
was
greatly
set
up
by
the
honor
and
handed
the
tradition
of
it
down
the
family
as
something
that
must
never
be
forgotten
oh
i
have
fought
for
the
laddie
myself
if
i
been
a
man
in
his
days
is
the
spirit
of
personal
loyalty
dead
we
give
patriotic
devotion
to
our
country
but
love
such
as
that
of
an
ancient
highlander
for
his
hereditary
chief
seems
absolutely
a
thing
of
the
past
while
their
elders
entertained
the
circle
with
northern
legends
or
border
ballads
the
young
people
also
did
their
share
and
contributed
such
choice
morsels
as
ghost
stories
adventures
in
foreign
lands
or
weird
tales
of
the
occult
stewart
who
was
an
omnivorous
reader
of
magazines
tried
to
demonstrate
the
romance
of
modern
literature
though
he
could
never
convince
his
mother
of
its
equality
with
favorites
marjorie
anderson
who
had
a
sweet
voice
loved
soldier
ditties
and
caroled
them
much
to
the
admiration
of
captain
preston
who
always
managed
to
contrive
to
get
a
seat
near
her
particular
corner
of
the
fireside
i
believe
those
two
are
match
whispered
peachy
to
irene
one
evening
so
do
i
they
met
first
when
marjorie
was
at
school
dona
told
me
all
about
it
and
it
was
quite
romantic
they
have
seen
more
of
each
other
only
after
the
armistice
his
regiment
was
ordered
out
to
india
home
on
leave
now
he
wrote
to
marjorie
all
the
time
he
was
away
regularly
she
tremendous
friends
with
his
sisters
and
they
asked
her
to
join
them
on
this
tour
looks
suspicious
does
it
rather
i
hope
it
will
really
come
off
answered
peachy
looking
sympathetically
at
the
attractive
pair
whose
chairs
always
seemed
to
gravitate
together
she
pretty
and
his
brown
eyes
are
the
twinkliest
i
ever
seen
yes
i
prepared
to
give
them
my
blessing
i
only
wish
he
get
on
with
it
why
does
somebody
give
him
a
push
over
the
brink
and
make
him
propose
he
marking
time
and
for
two
cents
i
tell
him
so
myself
i
guess
his
eyes
would
pop
out
but
i
should
care
be
alarmed
i
promise
i
wo
interfere
but
onlookers
see
the
most
of
the
game
and
with
an
affair
like
this
under
my
very
nose
i
be
mad
if
they
do
up
captain
preston
was
hardly
likely
to
conduct
his
under
full
fire
of
inquisitive
eyes
but
he
generally
managed
to
appropriate
marjorie
on
walks
or
excursions
they
strolled
out
together
to
admire
the
moon
hunted
for
orchids
on
the
hills
searched
the
beach
for
shells
and
saw
enough
of
one
another
society
to
satisfy
the
most
ardent
matchmakers
it
was
an
established
fact
that
these
two
should
always
sit
together
in
boat
or
carriage
but
the
rest
of
the
party
revolved
like
a
kaleidoscope
lorna
sometimes
found
herself
escorted
by
stewart
or
angus
sometimes
by
charlie
or
michael
foard
the
friends
who
were
staying
with
them
and
oftener
still
by
vincent
beverley
whose
fair
hair
blue
eyes
and
merry
face
so
like
irene
specially
attracted
her
she
was
so
unaccustomed
to
have
a
cavalier
at
all
that
it
seemed
wonderful
to
her
that
any
one
should
take
the
trouble
to
carry
her
basket
pick
flowers
that
grew
out
of
her
reach
help
her
up
difficult
steps
or
hand
her
into
a
rocking
boat
this
new
aspect
of
the
world
was
very
sweet
insensibly
it
affected
her
lorna
growing
so
pretty
commented
peachy
to
irene
she
a
queer
girl
at
school
she
goes
about
looking
almost
plain
and
as
dreary
as
an
owl
she
suddenly
jumped
into
life
here
anybody
who
had
seen
the
two
sides
of
her
would
believe
the
difference
when
she
animated
she
nearly
beautiful
i
do
think
she
ever
been
really
appreciated
at
the
villa
camellia
replied
irene
mums
likes
her
immensely
she
says
there
so
much
in
her
and
that
she
only
wants
to
bring
her
out
as
for
vin
his
head
turned
he
made
me
vow
faithfully
to
engineer
that
he
sits
next
to
lorna
in
the
boat
are
you
going
with
stewart
well
i
promised
michael
if
he
a
particularly
good
boy
i
let
him
row
me
in
the
little
skiff
i
dare
say
charlie
will
be
angry
but
i
ca
help
it
the
foards
are
as
alike
as
buttons
in
looks
but
the
younger
one
is
so
infinitely
nicer
than
the
other
tuesday
wednesday
and
thursday
had
slipped
blissfully
by
except
for
the
few
hours
daily
during
which
the
steamer
from
naples
visited
capri
with
promenade
deck
filled
with
tourists
the
little
island
was
wonderfully
quiet
and
by
keeping
away
from
the
marina
grande
or
the
highroads
it
was
possible
to
avoid
other
if
they
were
not
on
the
sea
the
clan
as
the
whole
party
liked
to
call
themselves
generally
went
up
the
hills
to
escape
civilization
the
natives
had
begun
to
know
them
and
though
they
might
be
offered
oranges
figs
or
dates
by
street
vendors
they
were
not
continually
pestered
to
take
carriages
engage
guides
or
donkeys
or
buy
picture
or
long
strings
of
coral
irene
loved
occasional
excursions
into
the
white
town
on
the
rock
the
strict
rules
and
convent
seclusion
of
the
villa
camellia
had
given
her
no
opportunity
of
sampling
shops
at
fossato
so
except
for
her
holiday
at
naples
this
was
her
first
experience
of
marketing
in
italy
the
unfamiliar
money
and
measures
were
of
course
confusing
but
the
quaint
little
cakes
the
lollipops
wrapped
in
fringed
tissue
paper
of
gay
colors
the
sugar
hearts
the
plaited
baskets
the
inlaid
boxes
the
mosaic
brooches
the
beads
and
the
hundred
and
one
cheap
trifles
spread
forth
on
stalls
or
in
windows
fascinated
her
and
drew
many
lire
from
her
purse
she
only
knew
a
few
words
of
colloquial
italian
but
she
used
these
to
the
best
advantage
and
made
up
the
rest
with
nods
and
smiles
a
language
well
understood
by
the
kindly
people
of
capri
to
whom
a
gesture
is
as
eloquent
as
a
whole
sentence
vincent
whose
talents
ran
more
towards
prowess
at
football
than
a
gift
for
languages
would
often
escort
his
sister
and
conducted
his
bargaining
by
pointing
to
what
he
wanted
and
counting
the
price
in
lire
on
his
five
fingers
an
operation
that
caused
fits
of
amusement
to
the
shopkeepers
with
whom
the
fair
young
englishman
became
quite
a
favorite
as
long
as
vincent
could
see
what
he
wished
for
on
sale
and
indicate
it
with
a
finger
he
got
along
all
right
but
matters
grew
complicated
if
he
tried
to
explain
himself
one
day
his
mother
having
run
short
of
methylated
spirit
for
her
teakettle
sent
him
with
a
bottle
to
buy
some
more
he
looked
the
words
up
in
a
dictionary
entered
a
chemist
and
demanded
alcohol
for
burning
in
his
best
italian
the
assistant
seemed
mystified
but
suddenly
a
light
flooded
his
intelligent
face
he
flew
to
a
series
of
neat
little
drawers
behind
the
counter
rummaged
about
and
in
much
triumph
produced
an
alcock
porous
plaster
which
he
vehemently
assured
vincent
would
be
sure
to
burn
and
was
a
real
english
medicine
imported
with
great
trouble
and
expense
and
certain
to
cure
the
ailment
from
which
he
was
suffering
how
vincent
would
have
got
out
of
the
tangle
or
convinced
the
chemist
assistant
that
he
was
not
in
need
of
medical
aid
is
uncertain
but
at
that
moment
irene
who
was
walking
with
lorna
in
the
square
spied
him
through
the
window
and
brought
her
chum
to
the
rescue
lorna
italian
was
excellent
she
soon
unravelled
the
matter
returned
the
porous
plaster
to
the
disappointed
assistant
and
explained
to
vincent
that
the
local
name
for
methylated
spirit
was
spirito
and
that
it
was
generally
procured
from
an
oil
colorman
how
was
i
to
know
grumbled
vincent
dramatically
a
fellow
goes
by
the
dictionary
it
always
called
in
rome
and
in
some
other
places
pacified
lorna
who
was
still
laughing
at
the
mistake
and
i
bought
it
at
a
chemist
myself
in
naples
come
along
round
the
corner
and
we
find
the
right
shop
i
had
my
own
bottle
filled
there
yesterday
so
i
know
where
to
go
on
the
friday
cameron
who
by
universal
consent
had
constituted
herself
organizer
of
the
various
joint
expeditions
sent
out
invitations
for
a
grand
gathering
of
the
clan
to
go
and
view
the
ruins
of
the
villa
of
tiberius
this
was
one
of
the
principal
sights
of
the
island
and
as
the
preston
party
were
not
staying
over
the
following
week
it
would
have
seemed
a
pity
for
them
to
miss
it
it
a
case
of
taking
and
going
for
the
day
said
stewart
delivering
his
messages
at
the
various
villas
the
piazza
in
the
town
those
who
like
to
come
up
by
the
funicular
can
do
so
we
wait
for
them
i
think
the
mater
will
take
the
train
and
save
herself
some
of
the
climb
she
does
like
these
endless
steps
and
it
certainly
a
pull
from
our
place
to
the
town
it
worth
while
walking
down
to
the
marina
to
get
the
railway
beverley
roper
and
joyce
preston
joined
cameron
in
taking
advantage
of
the
little
ferrovia
funicolare
that
connected
the
harbor
with
the
town
and
arrived
on
the
piazza
cool
and
fresh
compared
with
those
who
had
preferred
to
toil
up
the
steep
path
i
told
you
to
come
with
me
renie
child
chided
beverley
look
how
hot
you
are
already
you
be
quite
overdone
before
we
get
to
the
summit
oh
mums
darling
i
not
tired
i
saved
the
fare
and
bought
this
swanky
little
cane
instead
look
is
it
dinky
protested
irene
proudly
exhibiting
her
newly
purchased
treasure
it
has
a
leather
strap
and
a
tassel
and
a
knob
that
one
can
suck
you
baby
laughed
her
mother
we
shall
have
to
buy
you
a
tin
trumpet
i
do
believe
you
out
of
the
nursery
yet
tin
trumpet
mums
darling
oh
you
given
me
such
an
idea
purred
irene
running
to
michael
foard
and
whispering
some
communication
into
his
sympathetic
ear
which
caused
him
to
walk
back
to
a
certain
street
stall
and
purchase
nine
tin
whistles
with
which
the
younger
members
of
the
party
armed
themselves
and
immediately
began
a
desperate
attempt
to
reproduce
the
bluebells
of
scotland
hugely
to
the
entertainment
of
the
natives
who
flocked
to
their
doors
all
smiles
and
amused
exclamations
bairns
i
think
shame
of
you
declared
cameron
they
take
us
for
a
wandering
circus
put
those
unmusical
instruments
in
your
pockets
till
we
clear
of
the
town
i
never
heard
a
poor
scottish
air
so
mangled
you
may
practice
your
band
on
the
hills
and
scare
the
goats
do
play
it
in
my
ears
again
till
you
catch
the
proper
tune
the
musicians
after
their
first
burst
of
enthusiasm
was
expended
were
glad
to
save
their
breath
for
the
climb
when
houses
were
left
behind
their
way
wound
between
high
walls
up
up
up
along
a
paved
pathway
among
orange
groves
till
at
last
the
allotments
disappeared
and
they
were
on
the
open
hillside
among
the
low
shrubs
and
the
rough
grass
and
the
beautiful
flowers
irene
running
up
a
bank
in
quest
of
broke
her
new
cane
into
four
pieces
but
was
somewhat
consoled
by
a
stick
which
michael
cut
her
from
a
chestnut
tree
it
has
a
knob
to
suck
he
laughed
but
i
tie
a
stick
of
peppermint
on
to
the
end
of
it
if
you
like
do
tease
me
or
i
throw
a
squashy
orange
at
you
i
thought
you
were
fond
of
peppermint
so
i
am
and
if
there
another
of
those
creamy
neapolitans
left
in
your
pocket
i
accept
it
and
forgive
you
right
you
are
o
queen
there
are
two
here
does
your
majesty
prefer
a
purple
paper
or
a
green
the
ruins
which
formed
the
goal
of
their
expedition
were
the
remains
of
a
once
splendid
villa
erected
by
the
emperor
tiberius
and
used
constantly
by
him
until
his
death
in
most
of
the
party
were
disappointed
to
find
them
as
peachy
expressed
it
so
very
ruiny
it
was
difficult
to
picture
what
the
original
palace
must
have
been
like
for
nothing
was
left
of
all
the
grandeur
but
crumbling
walls
over
which
nature
had
scattered
ferns
and
flowers
at
the
very
top
some
of
the
old
masonry
had
been
used
to
build
a
tiny
church
this
was
closed
but
peeping
through
the
grille
in
the
door
the
visitors
could
catch
glimpses
of
roof
and
of
little
model
ships
placed
as
votive
offerings
by
the
sailors
in
gratitude
for
preservation
from
danger
at
sea
outside
this
chapel
was
a
great
stone
monument
built
so
near
the
edge
of
the
cliff
that
when
sitting
on
its
steps
one
could
look
down
a
sheer
drop
of
several
hundred
feet
into
the
blue
waters
below
the
view
from
here
was
magnificent
and
as
the
clan
in
turns
scanned
the
neighboring
coast
of
italy
with
field
glasses
they
believed
they
could
even
distinguish
the
greek
temples
at
pæstum
the
girls
described
the
glorious
excursion
they
had
taken
there
from
school
you
were
lucky
to
be
able
to
go
all
the
way
by
commented
cameron
dad
and
i
went
there
on
our
honeymoon
years
and
years
ago
and
traveled
all
the
way
from
naples
by
a
terrible
little
jolting
train
that
carried
and
as
well
as
passenger
carriages
i
sha
ever
forget
that
journey
we
had
to
leave
the
station
at
and
when
we
came
downstairs
we
found
it
was
a
pouring
wet
day
it
was
only
the
fact
that
the
sleepy
looking
waiter
at
our
hotel
must
have
roused
himself
at
to
prepare
our
coffee
and
that
we
did
not
like
to
ask
him
to
do
it
again
another
morning
that
forced
us
to
set
off
in
the
rain
i
never
felt
so
disinclined
for
an
excursion
in
my
life
dad
said
afterwards
if
i
given
him
the
least
hint
have
joyfully
relinquished
it
but
each
thought
the
other
wanted
to
go
so
off
we
set
all
the
way
to
cava
it
simply
streamed
and
we
sat
in
our
corners
of
the
carriage
secretly
calling
ourselves
idiots
and
wondering
how
we
were
going
to
look
over
temples
in
a
deluge
but
our
heroism
was
rewarded
for
just
as
the
train
crossed
the
brigand
marsh
the
rain
stopped
and
the
sun
shone
out
and
the
effect
of
blue
sky
and
clouds
was
simply
glorious
we
had
a
great
joke
at
pæstum
a
mosquito
had
stung
me
badly
on
one
lid
so
that
i
looked
as
if
i
had
a
black
eye
it
was
most
uncomfortable
and
painful
i
remember
well
a
party
of
french
tourists
were
going
round
the
temples
and
as
they
passed
us
they
glanced
at
my
eye
and
then
at
daddy
a
husband
of
three
weeks
standing
and
they
murmured
something
to
one
another
i
could
catch
their
words
but
quite
plainly
they
were
saying
these
dreadful
english
evidently
given
her
a
black
eye
poor
thing
that
how
they
treat
their
wives
the
french
people
went
on
to
the
second
temple
and
dad
and
i
sat
down
to
eat
our
lunch
we
were
fearfully
annoyed
by
dogs
that
sat
in
front
of
us
and
watched
every
mouthful
and
barked
incessantly
did
they
trouble
you
too
how
funny
they
must
surely
be
the
descendants
of
our
dogs
who
inherited
a
bad
habit
dad
got
so
utterly
exasperated
that
he
said
he
must
and
would
get
rid
of
them
so
he
seized
my
umbrella
shook
it
furiously
at
them
and
yelled
out
in
the
most
awful
and
voice
he
could
command
just
at
that
moment
the
french
tourists
came
back
round
the
corner
they
turned
to
one
another
with
nods
of
comprehension
as
if
they
were
saying
did
i
tell
you
so
see
what
a
brute
he
really
is
and
they
cast
the
most
sympathetic
glances
at
me
as
they
filed
by
is
that
true
daddy
cameron
lazily
removed
his
cigarette
it
a
stock
story
my
dear
that
you
told
against
me
for
the
last
twenty
years
i
wo
say
that
it
not
exaggerated
go
on
telling
it
if
you
like
my
back
broad
enough
to
bear
it
shall
i
return
good
for
evil
well
as
i
walked
through
the
town
waiting
till
you
came
up
by
the
funicular
i
saw
one
of
the
tarantella
dancers
and
i
engaged
the
whole
troupe
to
come
to
the
house
and
give
us
a
performance
you
said
you
wanted
to
see
them
will
our
friends
here
honor
us
with
their
company
and
help
to
act
audience
it
seemed
an
appropriate
ending
to
such
a
delightful
day
and
all
the
party
readily
accepted
the
invitation
after
twilight
fell
they
assembled
at
the
camerons
villa
and
took
their
places
in
the
salon
which
had
been
temporarily
cleared
of
some
of
its
furniture
the
tarantella
dancers
who
were
accustomed
to
give
their
small
exhibition
to
visitors
brought
their
own
orchestra
with
them
a
thin
youth
who
played
the
violin
a
stout
individual
who
plucked
the
mandolin
and
an
enthusiast
who
twanged
the
guitar
the
performers
were
charmingly
dressed
in
the
old
native
costumes
of
the
country
the
men
in
soft
white
shirts
green
sleeveless
velvet
coats
red
plush
knickers
silk
stockings
and
shoes
with
scarlet
bows
while
the
girls
wore
gay
skirts
striped
sashes
lace
fichus
and
aprons
and
gold
beads
round
their
shapely
throats
they
danced
several
sprightly
measures
waving
tambourines
and
rattling
castanets
or
twining
silk
scarves
together
while
the
musicians
fiddled
and
strummed
their
hardest
then
six
of
them
stood
aside
and
the
two
principal
artists
advanced
to
do
a
star
turn
romeo
sang
an
impassioned
love
song
with
his
hand
on
his
heart
while
juliette
plucked
at
her
apron
and
appeared
doubtful
of
the
truth
of
his
protestations
then
the
funny
man
had
his
innings
he
sat
in
a
chair
with
a
shoe
in
his
hand
and
tried
to
smack
the
head
of
a
humorist
who
knelt
in
front
but
always
managed
neatly
to
avoid
his
blows
the
whole
being
punctuated
by
vigorous
exclamations
in
italian
and
much
energetic
music
from
the
orchestra
a
pretty
girl
sauntered
next
on
to
the
scene
and
sang
in
a
rather
peacock
voice
a
little
ditty
lamenting
the
weather
at
which
a
cavalier
came
to
the
rescue
and
chanting
his
offer
of
help
sheltered
her
with
a
huge
green
umbrella
under
which
they
proceeded
to
make
love
and
finally
executed
a
dance
beneath
its
friendly
shade
the
whole
of
the
little
performance
was
very
graceful
and
attractive
savoring
so
thoroughly
of
southern
italy
and
showing
the
courteous
manners
and
winning
smiles
to
the
utmost
advantage
the
dancers
themselves
seemed
to
have
enjoyed
it
and
stood
with
beaming
faces
as
they
bowed
their
adieux
and
thanked
the
audience
for
their
kind
attention
are
they
just
too
perfect
commented
peachy

to
wear
a
velvet
bodice
and
a
green
skirt

border

want
to

chapter
xxi
the
blue
grotto
very
early
on
saturday
morning
carson
returned
to
capri
in
a
sailing
vessel
having
taken
advantage
of
a
night
crossing
and
arriving
with
the
dawn
lorna
had
bidden
her
friends
a
temporary
for
the
refusing
all
kind
invitations
of
bring
your
father
to
see
us
or
tell
him
he
must
join
the
clan
she
felt
that
her
excuses
for
him
were
of
the
flimsiest
she
said
he
was
tired
unwell
and
needed
absolute
rest
and
solitude
and
begged
them
to
forgive
her
if
she
spent
the
time
with
him
alone
and
though
they
replied
that
they
could
understand
his
desire
for
quiet
she
was
conscious
that
they
thought
she
might
at
least
have
volunteered
an
introduction
lorna
knew
only
too
well
that
if
her
father
was
aware
there
was
the
slightest
danger
of
meeting
english
people
he
would
probably
insist
upon
taking
the
next
boat
back
to
naples
it
was
the
consciousness
of
complete
isolation
that
gave
the
value
to
his
holiday
she
told
him
indeed
that
she
had
met
some
of
her
school
friends
and
had
taken
walks
with
them
but
she
mentioned
that
they
were
staying
down
below
nearer
the
marina
and
that
they
were
not
in
the
least
likely
to
come
up
to
the
casa
verdi
let
us
take
our
books
daddy
she
suggested
and
go
and
sit
on
the
hillside
as
we
did
last
sunday
it
was
quiet
on
that
ledge
of
the
crag
and
away
from
everybody
the
rest
did
you
good
and
i
sure
you
enjoyed
it
lying
on
the
cliff
among
the
flowers
with
blue
sky
above
and
blue
sea
beneath
poor
carson
allowed
himself
a
temporary
relaxation
he
smoked
his
pipe
and
read
his
paper
and
for
a
little
while
at
least
the
hard
lines
round
his
mouth
softened
and
his
anxious
eyes
grew
easy
he
finished
his
italian
journal
lay
idly
watching
the
scenery
chatted
dozed
and
finally
stretched
out
his
hand
for
one
of
lorna
books
it
happened
to
be
an
anthology
of
poetry
which
irene
had
lent
her
and
which
contained
one
of
the
ballads
that
cameron
had
recited
to
the
assembled
clan
it
had
struck
lorna
fancy
and
she
was
trying
to
learn
it
by
heart
carson
turned
over
the
pages
read
a
few
of
the
pieces
and
was
closing
the
little
volume
when
his
eye
chanced
to
light
upon
the
name
written
on
the
title
page
its
effect
upon
him
was
like
a
charge
of
electricity
david
beverley
he
gasped
david
beverley
lorna
great
heavens
by
all
that
sacred
where
did
you
get
this
illustration
all
that
sacred
where
did
you
get
this
book
why
dad
what
the
matter
irene
lent
me
the
book
it
belongs
to
her
father
her
father
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
your
friend
father
is
david
beverley
why
not
dad
whispered
lorna
looking
with
apprehension
into
his
haggard
excited
face
she
guessed
even
before
he
spoke
what
the
answer
was
going
to
be
david
beverley
is
the
man
who
ruined
my
life
the
blow
which
had
fallen
was
utterly
overwhelming
for
a
moment
lorna
fought
against
the
knowledge
like
a
drowning
man
battling
with
the
waters
oh
dad
surely
there
some
mistake
it
be
is
it
some
other
beverley
perhaps
i
know
his
writing
only
too
well
there
no
possibility
of
a
mistake
besides
i
saw
him
in
naples
at
the
end
of
february
i
forgotten
the
shock
it
gave
me
why
turning
almost
fiercely
upon
lorna
did
you
tell
me
your
schoolfellow
name
before
have
you
all
this
time
been
making
friends
with
your
father
enemy
i
thought
i
often
talked
about
renie
faltered
poor
lorna
perhaps
i
never
mentioned
her
surname
oh
dad
dad
is
it
really
true
it
too
horrible
to
be
believed
lying
in
the
soft
capri
grass
with
the
pink
cistus
flowers
brushing
her
hot
cheeks
lorna
raged
impotently
against
the
tragedy
of
a
fate
which
was
changing
the
dearest
friendship
of
her
life
into
a
feud
irene
the
only
one
at
school
who
had
sympathized
and
understood
her
who
had
behaved
with
a
delicacy
and
kindness
such
as
no
other
person
had
ever
shown
her
who
had
taken
her
into
her
home
circle
and
given
her
the
happiest
time
she
had
ever
had
in
her
shadowed
girlhood
irene
with
her
merry
gray
eyes
and
her
bright
sunny
hair
the
very
incarnation
of
genuine
affection
irene
her
roommate
her
buddy
her
chosen
confidante
how
was
it
possible
ever
to
regard
her
as
an
enemy
yet
had
she
not
vowed
a
solemn
oath
to
hate
all
belonging
to
the
man
who
had
so
desperately
injured
them
oh
the
world
seemed
turning
upside
down
loyalty
to
her
father
and
love
for
her
friend
dragged
different
ways
and
in
the
bitter
conflict
her
heart
was
torn
in
two
carson
haunted
to
the
verge
of
insanity
by
the
terror
of
discovery
was
now
obsessed
with
the
one
idea
of
escape
from
beverley
he
no
longer
felt
safe
on
the
island
any
moment
he
dreaded
to
meet
faces
that
would
betray
recognition
of
his
past
the
calm
and
content
of
his
visit
were
utterly
shattered
and
a
sudden
violent
impulse
urged
him
to
return
to
naples
capri
is
not
large
enough
to
hold
myself
and
david
beverley
he
declared
we
go
back
by
the
night
boat
lorna
meantime
we
borrow
signor
verdi
skiff
and
paddle
about
among
the
rocks
i
feel
easier
on
water
than
on
land
i
like
the
sense
of
a
space
of
ocean
round
me
you
ca
suddenly
meet
a
man
when
you
plenty
of
can
you
no
no
dad
said
lorna
trying
to
soothe
him
we
can
walk
down
the
steps
to
the
cove
and
get
the
skiff
and
be
quite
away
from
everybody
once
we
are
on
the
sea
she
was
ready
to
humor
his
every
whim
for
in
the
blackness
of
her
trouble
nothing
seemed
at
present
to
really
matter
the
whirling
eddies
of
her
thoughts
rushed
through
her
brain
in
a
perpetual
series
of
questions
and
answers
must
hate
strike
the
death
knell
of
love
surely
the
only
thing
to
do
with
an
injury
is
to
forgive
it
would
revenge
wipe
out
the
wrong
or
in
any
way
solve
anything
no
there
would
only
be
one
more
wrong
done
in
the
world
to
go
on
in
circles
of
hatred
and
misery
curses
like
chickens
come
home
to
roost
and
getting
even
may
bring
its
own
punishment
our
only
chance
is
to
go
away
and
start
afresh
in
a
new
country
she
sobbed
at
the
other
side
of
the
pacific
we
might
forget
but
no
renie
renie
if
i
go
to
the
back
of
beyond
i
sha
forget
you
and
all
you
been
to
me
the
memory
of
you
darling
will
last
until
the
end
of
my
life
carson
found
signor
verdi
working
in
his
allotment
obtained
leave
from
him
to
use
the
skiff
and
climbing
down
the
flight
of
steep
steps
cut
in
the
rock
reached
the
cove
where
the
boat
was
beached
on
the
shingle
he
had
been
an
expert
oarsman
from
his
college
days
and
understood
neapolitan
waters
so
in
a
short
time
he
and
lorna
were
skimming
gently
over
the
surface
of
the
blue
sea
keeping
well
away
from
rocks
and
out
of
currents
but
within
reasonable
distance
of
the
land
sometimes
they
rowed
and
sometimes
they
drifted
hardly
caring
in
what
direction
they
steered
so
long
as
they
circled
round
the
island
their
only
object
was
to
stop
out
on
the
sea
and
as
they
had
brought
a
picnic
basket
with
them
there
was
nothing
to
urge
their
return
until
sunset
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
they
had
coasted
below
monte
solaro
and
found
themselves
approaching
the
entrance
that
led
to
the
blue
grotto
in
the
mornings
when
the
steamer
brought
its
crowd
of
tourists
there
was
generally
quite
a
little
fleet
of
skiffs
to
be
seen
here
but
now
with
the
exception
of
a
solitary
boat
the
famous
cavern
was
deserted
to
avoid
passing
too
near
to
even
this
one
craft
carson
steered
away
from
the
shore
but
turned
his
head
in
consternation
for
loud
and
unmistakable
cries
of
help
were
ringing
over
the
water
and
the
occupants
frantically
waving
handkerchiefs
were
evidently
doing
their
utmost
to
attract
his
attention
common
humanity
demanded
that
he
must
at
least
go
and
see
what
was
the
matter
so
he
reluctantly
altered
his
course
in
a
boat
close
to
the
entrance
of
the
grotto
were
several
young
people
and
lorna
instantly
recognized
angus
stewart
jess
michael
and
peachy
they
appeared
in
much
anxiety
and
directly
they
were
within
hailing
distance
they
called
out
their
news
beverley
and
vincent
and
irene
have
gone
inside
the
grotto
and
they
do
seem
able
to
get
out
again
we
can
hear
them
shouting
for
help
the
party
in
their
british
imprudence
had
not
brought
a
boatman
and
they
were
uncertain
what
to
do
their
own
barque
was
too
large
to
go
through
the
narrow
opening
into
the
cavern
and
they
looked
hopefully
at
carson
little
skiff
we
do
know
what
happened
gulped
jess
they
went
in
to
explore
the
roman
passage
just
by
themselves
they
been
gone
such
a
long
time
volunteered
the
others
listen
said
peachy
for
from
out
the
low
entrance
of
the
grotto
floated
a
faint
echoing
ghost
of
a
shout
lorna
glanced
imploringly
at
her
father
he
did
not
hesitate
for
a
moment
the
man
who
had
injured
him
was
inside
the
cavern
perhaps
in
deadly
danger
and
he
was
going
to
risk
his
own
life
and
his
to
save
him
and
risk
there
undoubtedly
was
a
breeze
had
arisen
and
agitated
the
surface
of
the
water
so
that
the
ingress
was
smaller
than
ever
and
more
difficult
to
compass
when
waves
lashed
the
tideless
mediterranean
even
the
capri
fishermen
shunned
entering
the
grotto
for
they
knew
its
perils
only
too
well
telling
lorna
to
lie
flat
on
her
back
carson
took
the
same
position
and
with
infinite
difficulty
managed
to
maneuver
the
skiff
into
the
rocky
entrance
there
was
barely
room
for
each
wave
bumped
it
against
the
roof
but
by
clinging
to
the
chain
he
worked
his
way
along
and
shot
through
into
the
lake
within
on
the
right
of
the
cavern
three
figures
holding
a
light
stood
on
a
kind
of
while
a
skiff
drifting
far
off
in
the
shadows
told
its
own
tale
carson
rowed
at
once
to
retrieve
the
truant
boat
and
towed
it
back
to
its
owners
we
thought
we
had
tied
it
securely
explained
beverley
we
were
utterly
aghast
when
we
came
back
and
found
it
had
drifted
it
would
have
been
a
horrible
experience
to
stay
here
all
night
if
the
sea
rose
we
might
even
have
been
imprisoned
for
days
we
were
fools
to
come
but
i
did
realize
the
danger
the
sea
is
much
rougher
already
said
carson
it
be
a
ticklish
matter
to
get
out
again
and
the
sooner
we
do
it
the
better
will
you
go
first
and
i
follow
on
after
it
like
you
lorna
to
come
to
rescue
us
i
always
called
you
my
good
angel
choked
irene
as
she
entered
the
skiff
i
thought
just
now
i
was
never
going
to
see
you
again
in
this
world
let
get
out
of
this
horrible
place
as
fast
as
we
can
it
like
dante
inferno
i
never
been
so
frightened
in
all
my
life
one
after
the
other
the
two
skiffs
started
on
their
risky
exit
from
the
grotto
scraping
and
bumping
against
the
roof
with
the
water
on
a
level
with
the
gunwale
one
wave
indeed
overflowed
and
soused
them
but
the
next
moment
they
sighted
the
sky
and
grazing
through
the
entrance
they
gained
the
open
water
it
was
only
when
in
the
clear
afternoon
daylight
he
turned
to
thank
his
rescuer
that
a
flash
of
recognition
flooded
beverley
face
cedric
houghten
you
you
he
stammered
as
if
almost
disbelieving
the
evidence
of
his
own
eyes
yes
it
is
i
but
having
seen
me
forget
me
returned
carson
his
dark
face
flushed
and
his
hand
on
the
oar
it
the
one
favor
you
can
do
me
for
saving
you
let
me
vanish
as
i
came
and
do
try
to
follow
me
i
only
hope
we
may
never
cross
each
other
paths
again
cedric
come
back
yelled
beverley
as
the
skiff
shot
away
man
alive
we
been
searching
for
you
for
years
do
you
know
that
proved
your
innocence
come
back
i
say
and
let
me
tell
you
it
was
late
that
evening
after
a
very
long
talk
with
beverley
that
lorna
father
explained
to
her
the
circumstances
that
had
cleared
his
name
david
had
no
more
embezzled
the
money
than
i
and
thank
god
he
has
no
idea
i
ever
distrusted
him
when
a
further
sum
went
fenton
set
a
trap
and
discovered
to
his
infinite
grief
that
it
was
his
own
son
who
had
been
robbing
the
firm
it
practically
broke
him
and
he
has
retired
from
all
active
share
in
the
business
now
they
packed
young
fenton
off
to
new
zealand
to
try
farming
instead
of
finance
but
he
not
doing
any
good
there
fenton
it
seems
was
most
anxious
to
find
me
and
right
the
injustice
done
me
but
i
had
hidden
myself
so
well
under
an
assumed
name
in
naples
that
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
trace
me
they
advertised
in
the
agony
column
of
but
i
avoided
english
papers
so
never
saw
the
advertisements
my
efforts
to
escape
notice
were
only
too
successful
and
although
i
did
know
it
i
was
actually
defeating
my
own
ends
by
my
caution
if
as
i
intended
i
had
started
for
a
new
continent
i
might
so
completely
have
broken
all
links
with
my
old
life
that
i
might
have
gone
to
my
grave
in
ignorance
that
my
innocence
was
proved
it
was
only
the
marvelous
chance
of
this
afternoon
meeting
that
cleared
up
the
tangle
i
can
look
the
world
in
the
face
again
now
and
not
fear
the
sight
of
an
englishman
oh
the
joy
of
having
got
one
honor
back
untarnished
next
best
to
that
is
to
know
it
was
not
my
friend
who
had
wronged
me
the
belief
in
his
treachery
was
half
the
bitterness
of
those
dreadful
years
capri
has
been
a
fortunate
island
for
us
lorna
it
truly
called
the
of
naples
and
i
shall
love
it
to
the
end
of
my
days
i
can
take
my
old
name
again
now
and
be
proud
of
it
you
lorna
houghten
in
future
not
lorna
carson
what
a
triumph
to
write
to
our
relations
and
tell
them
the
glorious
news
i
feel
like
a
man
let
loose
from
slavery
to
lorna
also
this
happy
consummation
of
all
their
troubles
seemed
a
relief
almost
too
great
for
expression
that
irene
her
own
renie
should
be
the
daughter
of
her
father
favorite
friend
and
therefore
a
hereditary
as
well
as
a
chosen
chum
was
a
special
delight
for
it
welded
the
links
that
bound
them
together
the
future
shone
rosy
and
she
felt
that
wherever
her
life
might
be
cast
the
beverleys
would
always
remain
part
and
parcel
of
it
perhaps
the
triumph
she
appreciated
most
of
all
was
the
introduction
of
her
father
to
the
cameron
clan
no
more
hiding
in
corners
and
avoiding
the
very
sound
of
a
british
voice
henceforth
they
might
hold
up
their
heads
with
the
rest
and
take
again
their
true
position
she
was
proud
of
her
father
now
that
the
black
cloak
of
despair
had
dropped
away
from
him
his
old
happier
nature
shone
out
and
he
seemed
suddenly
ten
years
younger
to
present
him
into
the
intimate
circle
of
her
friends
realized
her
dearest
wish
it
been
a
wonderful
said
peachy
standing
with
her
girl
friends
on
the
quay
to
wave
to
the
monday
morning
steamer
that
bore
some
of
their
relations
back
to
naples
and
business
here
lorna
with
a
new
name
