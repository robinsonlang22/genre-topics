alice
gwin
elma
bessie
bessie
yes
mother
replied
bessie
challoner
you
be
late
for
school
child
if
you
are
not
quick
bessie
shouted
her
father
at
the
top
of
his
voice
from
below
stairs
bessie
late
as
usual
i
am
really
going
father
i
am
just
ready
was
the
eager
reply
bessie
caught
up
her
sailor
hat
shoved
it
carelessly
over
her
mass
of
thick
hair
and
searched
frantically
round
her
untidy
bedroom
for
the
string
bag
which
contained
her
schoolbooks
oh
bessie
you
get
into
a
scrape
said
judy
one
of
her
younger
sisters
dancing
into
the
room
why
you
are
late
i
hear
the
schoolbell
ringing
it
will
stop
in
a
moment
do
worry
me
judy
cried
bessie
do
you
know
where
my
bag
is
judy
ran
into
the
middle
of
the
room
turned
round
and
began
to
laugh
ecstatically
do
you
know
where
it
is
you
little
have
you
put
it
hiding
yes
yes
yes
screamed
the
child
jumping
up
and
down
in
her
joy
then
if
you
do
give
it
to
me
at
once
i
but
judy
had
dodged
her
and
was
out
of
the
room
up
to
the
attic
flew
the
child
and
after
her
dashed
bessie
the
bag
was
found
in
the
corner
of
the
bessie
aimed
a
frenzied
blow
at
judy
who
once
again
dodged
her
then
the
schoolgirl
ran
downstairs
and
was
out
of
the
house
bessie
for
shame
said
her
brother
who
was
standing
smoking
his
cigarette
in
a
very
lazy
manner
in
the
garden
why
you
never
get
full
marks
do
said
bessie
i
feel
quite
hunted
between
you
all
she
had
got
on
the
highroad
now
and
could
walk
away
in
peace
she
was
a
tall
girl
somewhat
at
present
with
a
face
which
showed
abundance
of
intellect
large
dreamy
eyes
a
wide
mouth
a
flat
nose
a
long
chin
bessie
was
certainly
not
at
all
a
pretty
girl
but
notwithstanding
this
fact
there
were
few
of
all
the
pupils
at
middleton
school
who
approached
her
in
popularity
she
was
clever
without
being
a
scrap
conceited
and
was
extremely
doing
her
work
for
the
pleasure
of
doing
it
and
not
because
she
wanted
to
outstrip
a
schoolfellow
she
was
conscientious
too
and
would
have
scorned
to
do
a
mean
or
shabby
thing
but
she
was
hopelessly
untidy
careless
to
a
fault
late
for
school
half
her
days
getting
into
countless
scrapes
and
getting
out
of
them
as
best
she
could
the
butt
of
her
class
as
well
as
the
favorite
always
true
to
herself
and
indifferent
to
the
censures
or
the
praise
of
her
well
bess
is
that
you
do
wait
for
me
called
out
a
panting
voice
in
the
distance
late
as
she
was
bessie
stopped
it
was
never
her
way
to
leave
a
in
the
lurch
a
girl
with
dancing
eyes
and
rosy
cheeks
came
panting
and
puffing
round
the
corner
i
just
caught
a
sight
of
the
red
ribbon
with
which
you
tie
your
hair
she
said
i
am
so
glad
you
are
late
i
am
too
and
i
am
quite
ashamed
of
myself
why
in
the
world
should
you
be
ashamed
of
yourself
alice
asked
bessie
i
do
suppose
you
meant
to
be
late
of
course
not
but
i
shall
lose
my
mark
for
punctuality
and
you
know
bessie
i
am
feverishly
anxious
to
get
a
move
and
to
to
win
the
scholarship
at
the
midsummer
bessie
yawned
slightly
come
on
alice
she
said
i
am
disgracefully
late
as
usual
and
we
need
not
make
matters
worse
i
suppose
we
must
wait
in
the
hall
now
until
prayers
are
over
it
too
bad
said
alice
i
tell
you
afterward
how
it
happened
bessie
i
am
glad
you
waited
for
me
they
always
scold
you
so
much
for
being
late
that
they
will
not
take
so
much
notice
of
me
may
i
slip
into
my
place
in
form
behind
you
if
you
like
said
bessie
they
entered
the
great
schoolhouse
turned
down
a
long
corridor
deposited
their
hats
and
jackets
on
the
pegs
provided
for
the
purpose
and
went
into
the
schoolroom
just
when
the
pupils
were
filing
into
their
different
classes
both
girls
had
marks
against
their
names
for
unpunctuality
alice
frowned
and
fidgeted
turned
scarlet
glanced
nervously
at
her
but
bessie
took
the
matter
with
her
wonted
calm
soon
she
forgot
all
about
it
she
became
absorbed
in
her
different
studies
each
one
of
which
she
had
prepared
with
extreme
attention
as
she
answered
question
after
question
her
great
full
dreamy
eyes
seemed
to
lighten
with
hidden
fire
her
face
lost
its
plainness
the
intellect
in
it
transformed
it
one
or
two
other
girls
in
the
class
watched
her
with
a
slight
degree
of
envy
bessie
was
very
high
up
in
the
school
as
usual
she
quickly
rose
to
the
head
of
the
form
this
position
she
kept
without
the
slightest
difficulty
during
lesson
after
lesson
alice
muddled
already
by
that
mark
for
unpunctuality
got
through
her
work
badly
as
bessie
rose
in
the
class
alice
went
down
at
the
end
of
the
morning
work
the
two
girls
were
far
as
the
poles
asunder
i
ca
think
how
you
do
it
said
alice
coming
up
to
bessie
during
recess
and
linking
her
hand
through
her
arm
you
never
seem
to
mind
disgrace
at
all
of
course
i
mind
disgrace
answered
bessie
come
out
into
the
playground
wo
you
alice
we
ca
talk
in
here
they
went
out
and
began
pacing
up
and
down
the
wide
quadrangle
devoted
to
the
purpose
other
girls
passed
them
two
and
two
each
girl
talking
to
her
special
companion
how
very
handsome
gwin
harley
looks
this
morning
said
alice
pausing
in
her
grumbling
to
gaze
at
a
slender
and
lovely
girl
who
passed
them
walking
with
another
somewhat
plain
girl
of
the
name
of
elma
lewis
i
wish
she
was
not
such
friends
with
elma
said
bessie
i
like
gwin
very
much
indeed
i
suppose
every
one
in
the
school
does
catch
elma
not
making
up
to
her
said
alice
why
you
know
gwin
is
as
rich
as
ever
she
can
be
she
has
a
of
her
own
i
can
not
make
out
why
she
comes
to
middleton
school
because
it
is
the
best
school
in
the
neighborhood
said
bessie
somewhat
proudly
it
is
not
a
question
of
money
nor
of
anything
but
simply
of
learning
we
learn
better
at
middleton
school
than
anywhere
else
there
are
better
teachers
and
but
such
a
rum
lot
of
girls
said
alice
of
course
we
all
go
in
sets
and
our
set
is
quite
the
nicest
in
the
school
but
all
the
same
i
wonder
a
rich
man
like
harley
allows
gwin
to
come
here
gwin
and
elma
drew
up
at
that
moment
in
front
of
the
other
two
bessie
said
gwin
i
saw
you
carrying
everything
before
you
this
morning
but
she
added
hastily
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
i
shall
never
be
a
great
learned
genius
like
you
but
i
shall
admire
geniuses
all
the
same
now
i
want
to
say
that
elma
is
coming
to
tea
with
me
this
afternoon
and
will
you
both
come
as
well
we
have
a
good
deal
to
talk
over
bessie
face
lightened
i
should
like
it
very
much
indeed
she
said
but
you
know
i
must
get
through
my
studies
first
oh
you
wo
take
long
over
them
yes
but
i
shall
answered
bessie
there
is
a
very
stiff
piece
of
german
to
translate
this
afternoon
i
can
manage
french
and
mathematics
of
course
and
oh
do
begin
to
rehearse
your
different
studies
said
gwin
holding
up
her
hand
in
a
warning
attitude
i
do
care
in
the
least
what
you
learn
bessie
i
want
you
to
come
because
she
added
you
are
such
an
honest
creature
why
should
not
i
be
honest
said
bessie
opening
her
eyes
wide
i
have
never
had
any
temptation
to
be
anything
else
my
dear
bessie
you
are
too
painfully
said
elma
gwin
meant
that
your
nature
is
transparent
it
is
a
beautiful
trait
in
any
character
well
bessie
will
you
come
or
will
you
not
interrupted
gwin
yes
i
come
i
manage
it
somehow
said
bessie
i
ca
resist
the
temptation
and
you
too
alice
said
gwin
turning
to
alice
denvers
who
was
watching
bessie
with
envious
eyes
i
do
suppose
mother
will
let
me
i
am
ever
so
vexed
said
alice
but
why
not
dear
you
have
nothing
special
to
do
well
i
had
a
bad
mark
for
unpunctuality
and
what
does
that
signify
but
listen
i
have
gone
down
several
places
in
class
father
and
mother
are
so
particular
they
seem
to
think
my
whole
future
life
depends
upon
my
position
in
school
of
course
i
know
we
are
not
very
rich
like
you
here
she
flushed
and
hesitated
gwin
harley
flushed
also
when
you
talk
like
that
she
said
i
feel
quite
ashamed
of
being
well
off
i
often
long
to
be
poor
like
like
dear
little
elma
here
as
she
spoke
she
patted
her
somewhat
squat
little
companion
on
her
arm
but
never
mind
girls
i
am
not
one
of
those
who
intend
to
throw
away
all
my
money
that
is
one
reason
why
i
want
to
have
a
good
talk
this
afternoon
you
must
come
alice
you
simply
must
but
there
is
another
reason
said
alice
kitty
malone
is
coming
kitty
malone
who
in
the
name
of
fortune
is
she
oh
a
wild
irish
girl
truly
wild
i
should
think
with
that
name
malone
ohone
i
seem
to
hear
the
refrain
somewhere
now
is
there
a
song
called
malone
there
is
a
song
called
widow
malone
said
bessie
do
you
know
it
you
read
all
about
it
in
lorrequer
but
who
is
kitty
malone
alice
i
say
a
wild
irish
girl
and
what
has
she
got
to
do
with
you
she
is
coming
to
board
with
us
she
is
going
to
join
the
school
and
mother
is
to
have
the
charge
of
her
a
precious
bore
i
shall
find
it
when
did
you
say
she
was
coming
asked
gwin
eagerly
i
expect
she
is
at
home
by
now
she
was
to
arrive
this
morning
delightful
said
gwin
clapping
her
hands
she
shall
come
too
i
want
beyond
anything
to
become
acquainted
with
a
real
aborigine
and
of
course
any
girl
called
kitty
malone
hailing
from
the
must
belong
to
that
species
bring
the
wild
irish
girl
with
you
by
all
means
alice
and
now
as
you
have
no
manner
of
excuse
i
say
for
the
present
she
kissed
her
pretty
hand
lightly
to
the
two
girls
and
went
on
her
way
once
more
accompanied
by
her
faithful
satellite
elma
is
she
fascinating
said
alice
are
you
quite
in
love
with
her
bessie
dear
me
no
answered
bessie
challoner
i
never
fall
in
love
in
that
sort
of
headlong
fashion
but
all
the
same
she
added
i
admire
gwin
very
much
only
i
do
wish
she
would
not
take
up
with
elma
so
do
i
said
alice
it
was
very
kind
of
her
to
ask
us
continued
bessie
and
i
for
one
shall
be
delighted
to
go
i
have
not
the
least
doubt
that
in
a
big
house
of
that
sort
they
have
encyclopædia
and
i
want
to
look
up
the
article
on
magnetic
iron
oh
what
in
the
world
for
cried
alice
i
am
interested
in
magnets
and
but
there
alice
why
should
i
worry
you
with
the
sort
of
things
that
delight
me
i
am
going
and
that
is
all
right
you
will
be
sure
to
come
too
wo
you
alice
yes
i
must
manage
it
somehow
and
as
gwin
has
asked
kitty
malone
it
wo
make
it
quite
so
difficult
i
know
mother
would
not
let
me
leave
kitty
this
afternoon
for
it
is
from
the
money
point
of
view
a
great
thing
for
us
her
coming
her
people
are
quite
well
off
although
they
are
irish
they
live
in
an
old
castle
on
the
coast
of
donegal
and
kitty
has
never
been
out
of
the
country
in
which
she
was
born
they
are
paying
mother
very
well
to
receive
her
and
mother
is
ever
so
pleased
of
course
it
horrid
for
me
for
she
will
be
my
companion
morning
noon
and
night
we
are
even
to
sleep
in
the
same
room
it
was
that
that
made
me
late
for
school
this
morning
and
got
me
that
horrid
horrid
mark
for
unpunctuality
but
why
i
do
understand
said
bessie
well
you
see
i
put
it
off
until
the
last
minute
i
know
it
was
all
my
fault
but
i
would
not
empty
the
cupboard
in
the
corner
of
the
room
although
mother
told
me
to
do
so
at
intervals
for
the
past
week
well
mother
came
in
this
morning
and
found
it
choke
full
you
know
the
sort
of
thing
full
to
bursting
so
that
the
door
would
shut
and
she
said
that
i
should
empty
it
before
i
went
to
school
i
told
her
i
should
be
late
and
mother
said
it
was
a
just
punishment
for
me
did
i
bless
kitty
malone
but
of
course
i
set
to
work
and
i
scrambled
out
the
things
somehow
of
course
i
am
in
hot
water
and
father
is
so
terribly
particular
but
i
will
try
and
come
yes
i
try
and
come
and
bring
kitty
very
well
if
you
are
going
we
may
as
well
go
together
said
bessie
gwin
never
mentioned
the
hour
she
had
tea
but
i
suppose
if
we
are
at
harley
grove
by
five
it
will
do
yes
i
should
think
so
said
alice
in
a
dubious
voice
it
is
a
pity
she
did
not
mention
the
hour
there
she
is
still
hobnobbing
with
elma
i
just
run
across
the
quadrangle
and
ask
her
alice
left
her
companion
obtained
the
necessary
information
from
gwin
and
came
back
again
she
says
if
we
are
with
her
sharp
at
five
it
will
do
quite
well
and
we
are
to
stay
until
nine
then
we
can
all
go
home
together
delicious
said
bessie
i
love
being
out
late
i
hope
there
will
be
a
moon
and
that
there
wo
be
many
clouds
in
the
sky
for
i
want
to
examine
the
position
of
some
of
the
planets
did
i
tell
you
alice
that
uncle
john
has
a
telescope
through
which
i
can
see
the
asteroids
what
on
earth
are
they
cried
alice
yawning
as
she
spoke
oh
the
very
small
planets
then
my
dear
i
hope
you
will
see
them
but
really
bessie
i
run
round
nature
as
you
do
your
intellect
is
quite
overpowering
one
moment
you
want
to
get
up
information
with
regard
to
magnetic
iron
ore
and
the
next
you
confound
me
with
some
awful
observation
about
asteroids
bessie
i
shall
be
late
for
dinner
and
then
no
chance
of
going
to
the
fair
gwin
this
afternoon
well
if
you
do
go
call
for
me
shouted
bessie
after
her
i
wait
for
you
until
four
then
i
start
off
by
myself
yes
yes
i
come
if
i
can
and
bring
kitty
also
if
i
can
be
sure
you
do
fail
i
look
out
for
you
alice
put
wings
to
her
feet
and
set
off
running
down
the
dusty
road
and
bessie
more
soberly
returned
home
chapter
ii
the
blarney
stone
alice
home
was
nearly
half
a
mile
from
the
school
it
was
a
big
commonplace
suburban
house
standing
at
a
corner
it
had
a
small
garden
in
front
and
a
larger
one
at
the
back
but
neither
at
front
nor
back
were
the
gardens
tidily
kept
they
were
downtrodden
by
the
constant
pressure
of
many
feet
and
were
further
ornamented
at
intervals
by
sheds
and
kennels
for
fred
and
philip
denvers
were
devoted
to
all
sorts
of
pets
there
was
also
a
at
one
end
and
a
little
place
where
denvers
tried
to
keep
fowls
alice
at
intervals
had
sighed
for
a
tennis
lawn
but
whenever
she
dared
to
mention
the
idea
she
was
hooted
by
her
big
brothers
who
did
not
want
the
garden
to
be
made
in
the
least
bit
as
they
expressed
it
ornamental
but
tennis
is
ornamental
said
alice
beastly
game
remarked
fred
only
meant
for
girls
just
to
give
them
an
opportunity
of
hobnobbing
together
and
talking
gossip
and
making
up
mischief
you
talk
in
the
most
ridiculous
unfair
way
said
alice
in
indignation
but
she
did
not
dare
to
mention
the
subject
of
the
tennis
court
again
and
the
boys
still
continued
to
build
fresh
sheds
and
introduce
new
animals
on
this
occasion
as
alice
walked
up
to
the
house
she
was
met
by
fred
who
ran
out
to
meet
her
in
some
excitement
i
say
alice
he
cried
she
come
and
she
is
a
rum
who
has
come
asked
alice
not
not
kitty
malone
no
one
else
at
your
service
kitty
malone
ohone
cried
fred
and
oh
is
she
irish
you
come
along
and
see
her
i
never
saw
anything
like
her
before
why
fred
i
did
think
you
cared
for
girls
nor
do
i
as
a
rule
but
this
one
oh
i
say
she
is
a
jolly
sort
why
she
been
down
in
the
kitchen
and
up
in
the
attics
she
knows
every
one
in
the
house
already
and
do
you
know
what
she
is
doing
now
sitting
in
the
with
the
window
wide
open
grinning
down
at
you
and
she
has
got
pointer
in
her
arms
you
know
pointer
dirty
old
fellow
well
she
caught
him
up
the
moment
she
came
in
and
insisted
on
bringing
him
upstairs
and
he
has
taken
to
her
as
if
he
had
known
her
ever
since
he
was
a
puppy
mean
of
him
is
it
but
i
declare
i
blame
him
oh
there
you
are
kitty
malone
fred
raised
his
laughing
face
to
encounter
another
as
laughing
a
face
at
that
moment
grinning
from
ear
to
ear
are
you
alice
called
a
voice

you
the
one
i
am
to
sleep
with

to
that
sort
of
thing

thought
alice
she
liked
frank
jolly
girls
but
she
was
not
quite
prepared
for
kitty
she
entered
the
house
flung
down
her
bag
of
books
and
ran
upstairs
to
the
the
next
moment
she
found
herself
in
the
firm
embrace
of
a
girl
a
little
taller
than
herself
a
slim
very
pretty
very
untidy
very
overdressed
girl

alice

kitty
clapping
her
hands
and
winking
broadly
at
fred
alice

to
leave
the
room
we
may
as
well
go
together
said
kitty
following
her
and
slipping
her
hand
through
her
arm
do
you
know
she
said
when
i
first
came
to
the
house
i
could
scarcely
breathe
why
it
nothing
but
a
nutshell
i
never
saw
such
a
deeny
dawn
of

place

the
whole
course
of
my
life
how
many
of

to
the
window
and
let
me
have
a
good
squint
at
you
as
kitty
spoke
she
dragged
alice
forward
put
her
facing
the
light
and
stood
herself
with
her
back
to
it
she
began
to
make
a
careful
scrutiny
calling
out
her
remarks
aloud
eyes
passable
forehead
mouth
pretty
well
complexion
not
bad
for
england
hair
oh
i
say
kitty

said
alice
are
those
your
manners
in
ireland
what
a
wild
country
it
must
be
dear
darling
jolly
old
place
said
kitty
dancing
up
and
down
and
you
really
give
me
to
understand
that
people
make
remarks
on
one
another
in
that
sort
of
fashion
said
alice
darting
away
from
her
companion
and
pouring
some
water
into
a
basin
to
wash
her
hands
well
yes
love
they
do
when
they
like
and
they
do
when
they
do
like
we
are
free
and
easy
folk
i
can
tell
you
and
we
have
a
gay
time
i
tell
you
all
about
father
and
the
old
castle
and
the
dogs
and
the
cows
and
the
cats
and
the
rabbits
and
the
mice
when
we
have
a
spare
moment
that
brother
of
yours
fred
is
not
half
a
bad
old
chap
and
i
saw
a
nice
little
gossoon
coming
in
just
now
with
his
books
under
his
arm
what
his
name
oh

philip

the
youngest
he

two
at
home
pat
and
laurence
and
oh
i
shall
miss
laurie
dear
old
chap
i
must
not
think
of
him
kitty
face
underwent
a
swift
change
the
brightness
went
out
of
it
just
as
if
a
heavy
cloud
had
swept
away
the
sun
the
big
very
handsome
eyes
so
dark
as
to
be
almost
black
grew
full
of
sudden
tears
the
exquisitely
curved
lips
trembled
she
turned
her
head
aside
and
looked
out
of
the
window
at
that
moment
it
seemed
to
alice
that
she
saw
beneath
kitty
wild
eccentric
manners
a
heart
of
gold
she
only
caught
a
glimpse
of
it
for
the
next
moment
the
girl
was
chatting
away
in
the
most
light
frivolous
extraordinary
style
the
sounded
through
the
house
and
the
pair
went
down
to
dinner
i
like
to
sit
near
you
please
denvers
said
kitty
philip
place
was
always
near
his
father
this
had
been
a
custom
ever
since
he
had
been
a
baby
kitty
now
ensconced
herself
in
the
little
boy
chair
am
i
taking
anybody
seat
she
asked
looking
up
only
mine
said
phil
never
mind
little
gossoon

to
sit
near
denvers
because

do
understand
you
must
allow
me
to
eat
my
dinner
miss
malone
you
see
i
have
a
good
deal
of
carving
to
do
and
besides
i
am
a
busy
man
said
denvers
in
a
voice
for
it
was
difficult
to
resist
the
roguish
glances
of
kitty
eyes
and
the
sort
of
affectionate
way
in
which
she
cuddled
up
to
her
host
side
oh
i
wo
talk
much
she
said
glancing
with
her
flashing
eyes
round
at
the
entire
party
but
you
see
i
am
quite
a
stranger
and
oh
my
the
place
does
seem
lonely
you
are
all
so
stiff
i
can
not
quite
understand
it
is
it
the
english
fashion
please
mr
denvers
well
you
see
answered
denvers
from
the
other
end
of
the
table
we
do
know
you
yet
but
i
am
sure
all
the
same
we
shall
be
very
good
friends
said
denvers
may
i
give
you
a
glass
of
wine
wine
bless
you
i
a
teetotaller
said
kitty
why
it
is
habits
of
intoxication
you
be
putting
into
me
i
never
take
anything
but
water
or
milk
when
i
can
get
it
and
it
is
miss
malone
you
going
to
call
me

it
for
if

i
tell
you
frankly
that
i
die
entirely
i
must
be
kitty
from
this
moment
or
kitty
malone
or
anything
of
that
sort
but
kitty
something
it
must
be
now
is
it
settled
fair
and
square
kitty
shall
i
be
here
my
hand
on
my
heart
i
die
if
i
called
miss
malone
fred
burst
into
roars
of
laughter
i
say
he
cried
what
an
extraordinary
girl
you
are
well
and
so
are
you
an
extraordinary
boy
said
kitty
oh
dear
me
i
am
hungry
do
you
mind
handing
me
over
the
potatoes
why
you
do
mean
to
say
you
peel
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
why
do
you
have
them
in
their
jackets
potatoes
are
generally
mashed
or
peeled
or
something
of
that
sort
in
england
said
denvers
i
see
kitty
he
added
ah
bless
you
now
for
calling
me
that
what
is
it
you
want
to
say
dear
mr
denvers
i
see
we
shall
have
a
good
deal
to
teach
you
he
said
and
then
he
too
burst
into
a
fit
of
laughter
and
so
the
merry
somewhat
rollicking
meal
proceeded
alice
alone
would
not
succumb
to
the
fascinations
of
the
irish
maiden
she
sat
holding
herself
somewhat
stiff
feeling
a
good
deal
disgusted
wondering
what
bessie
challoner
would
say
what
gwin
harley
would
think
anticipating
in
advance
elma
sneers
kitty
however
subjugated
and
denvers
and
the
two
boys
completely
as
to
pointer
he
would
not
leave
her
side
as
her
long
white
taper
fingers
touched
the
top
of
his
grizzled
head
he
looked
at
her
with
eyes
of
unutterable
love
what
have
you
done
to
the
dog
said
fred
at
last
he
felt
almost
afraid
in
his
great
admiration
of
the
bewitching
stranger
only
given
him
a
taste
of
blarney
was
the
reply
tell
me
now
fred
were
you
ever
in
ireland
no
answered
fred
ah
i
thought
as
much
if
you
had
been
and
if
you
had
kissed
the
blarney
stone
why
then
it
nothing
could
withstand
you
what
is
the
blarney
stone
asked
fred
do
you
know
that
much
why
you
are
an
ignoramus
out
and
out
well
i
tell
you
it
a
stone
on
blarney
castle
set
low
down
in
the
wall
five
or
six
feet
from
the
top
and
to
kiss
it
why
that
is
no
easy
matter
for
you
have
to
be
held
by
your
heels
and
let
hang
over
the
wall
and
if
you
can
get
some
one
to
hold
you
tight
very
tight
mind
you
slide
down
and
you
reach
the
stone
and
you
kiss
it
and
from
that
moment
oh
glory
but
you
carry
everything
before
you
there
not
a
man
a
woman
nor
a
child
no
nor
a
beastie
either
that
can
resist
you
you
bewitch
i
have
no
doubt
kitty
you
kissed
the
stone
said
denvers
why
then
it
yes
sir
she
answered
raising
her
big
eyes
and
then
dropping
them
again
with
an
inimitable
expression
what
a
queer
little
girl
you
are
he
said
you
are
very
amusing
but
i
think
we
must
tame
you
a
bit
you
wo
do
that
sir
they
call
me
the
wild
irish
girl
at
home
and
the
wild
irish
girl
i
be
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
if
it
schooling
i
want
why
i
have
it
but
taming
no
thank
you
kitty
jumped
from
her
seat
and
began
to
dance
a
sort
of
improvised
irish
jig
about
the
room
do
you
know
the
jig
she
said
dancing
up
to
fred
as
she
spoke
no
he
answered
are
you
trying
it
on
now
yes
jump
up
my
hearty
and
i
teach
you
in
a
twinkling
here
watch
me
point
your
toes
so
turn
round
pirouette
as
we
call
it
now
then
put
your
hand
on
your
hip
courtesy
to
me
and
come
back
again
how
it
done
oh
fred
i
soon
have
you
as
beautiful
a
broth
of
a
boy
as
if
you
were
born
in
old
ireland
fred
my
son
it
is
time
for
you
to
go
back
to
college
said
his
father
kitty
we
are
very
pleased
to
have
you
here
and
you
are
a
very
amusing
girl
but
you
know
life
is
not
all
play
kitty
pulled
a
long
face
fred
darted
a
laughing
glance
at
her
and
ran
off
kitty
and
alice
at
last
found
themselves
alone
you
disapproving
of
me
a
good
bit
are
you
alice
said
kitty
going
up
to
the
other
girl
and
taking
both
her
hands
in
hers
well
i
think
you
are
very
odd
said
alice
and
do
you
want
me
to
be
quite
sober
and
tame
and
to
have
all
the
spirit
knocked
out
me
alanna
no
but
we
do
do
exactly
as
you
do
in
this
country
and
you
think
you
tame
me
into
your
pattern
i
do
know
about
that
i
do
understand
you
kitty
you
will
after
a
bit
alice
it
here
i
am
for
sure
and
a
gray
sort
of
land
it
is
why
the
sun
does
even
shine
oh
does
it
said
alice
angrily
it
ridiculous
to
talk
in
that
strain
about
this
country
we
have
much
finer
weather
than
you
have
in
ireland
do
be
cross
darling
i
mean
it
metaphorically
you
see
we
live
a
gay
life
over
there
we
have
a
joke
about
everything
and
the
wit
that
runs
out
of
our
mouths
why
it
like
flashes
of
lightning
oh
we
have
a
good
time
in
the
old
country
and
when
you
come
and
stay
with
me
at
castle
malone
you
say
so
for
yourself
now
then
what

you
want
to
do
this
afternoon

must
look
over
my
lessons

good
few

way
alice
said
denvers
who
came
into
the

that
moment

a
bad
mark
for
unpunctuality
this
morning

your
place
in

said
denvers

scrap
tired
said
kitty
i
as
gay
as
a
lark
and
as
fresh
as
a
daisy
i
hope
it
rather
a
big
swell
party
for
i
have
got
some
awfully
pretty
dresses
i
want
to
make
myself
look
smart
you
can
tell
me
how
they
manage
these
sort
of
things
in
england
i
all
agog
to
go
yes
alice
you
may
go
said
denvers
but
kitty
my
dear
if
i
were
you
i
would
let
them
down
lightly
what
do
you
mean
dear
mrs
denvers
do
startle
them
too
much
they
are
not
accustomed
to
such
such
frankness
as
you
are
disposed
to
give
i
bewitch
said
kitty
beginning
again
to
dance
with
light
fantastic
measure
up
and
down
the
room
i
bewitch
one
and
all
i
have
made
up
my
mind
i
did
kiss
the
blarney
stone
for
nothing
chapter
iii
is
that
the
girl
kitty
and
alice
went
up
to
their
bedroom
where
kitty
began
to
unpack
her
trunks
and
toss
her
dresses
about
they
were
all
new
and
most
of
them
were
gay
she
had
scarcely
a
dress
in
the
entire
collection
what
will
you
do
with
those
said
alice
who
saw
nothing
to
admire
in
the
fantastic
clothes
and
much
to
condemn
alice
had
not
the
smallest
love
for
dress
and
at
this
period
of
her
life
she
considered
any
pains
taken
over
clothes
a
sheer
waste
of
time
but
do
you
like
them
said
kitty
i
thought
girls
loved
pretty
dress
aunt
honora
says
so
and
so
did
aunt
bridget
when
she
came
to
see
us
at
castle
malone
a
month
ago
when
she
heard
i
was
going
to
england
she
said
then
my
dear
kitty
you
must
titivate
up
it
will
never
do
for
them
to
see
you
not
looking
as
bright
as
a
sunbeam
and
as
gay
as
a
cricket
it
colors
you
want
kitty
and
rich
materials
and
spangles
and
jewels
and
beads
and
all
the
other
and
father
said
to
aunt
bridget
then
now
biddy
said
he
just
get
what
right
for
the
child
for
she
has
a
notion
and
no
more
have
i
what
worn
in
that
foreign
place
england
so
aunt
bridget
said
wink
as
good
as
a
word
and
i
dress
her
up
in
dashing
style
so
she
took
the
measure
of
my
chest
and
the
round
of
my
waist
and
the
length
of
my
skirt
and
she
saw
how
many
inches
i
wanted
in
the
sleeve
and
she
said
leave
the
rest
to
me
kitty
and
of
course
i
did
and
in
three
weeks
time
down
came
a
trunk
that
would
make
your
eyes
shine
even
to
look
within
it
oh
was
it
just
the
darling
entirely
here
one
of
the
dresses
now
what
do
you
think
of
that
as
kitty
spoke
she
pulled
out
a
pink
made
up
with
innumerable
ruffles
and
frills
and
laces
and
embroidery
a
really
very
pretty
dress
for
quite
a
gay
party
but
totally
unsuitable
for
a
schoolgirl
of
kitty
malone
age
why
it
a
long
dress
said
alice
how
old
are
you
kitty
it
fifteen
i
be
my
next
birthday
darling
well
and
is
there
anything
wrong
about
fifteen
i
always
thought
it
was
a
jewel
of
an
age
yes
but
this
dress
is
long
why
there
a
train
to
it
oh
mercy
me
so
there
is
said
kitty
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
never
even
tried
on
the
skirt
i
was
so
bamboozled
and
overexcited
with
the
others
a
train
to
be
sure
oh
wo
i
bewitch
entirely
let
me
try
it
on
darling
have
you
got
a
long
anywhere
not
in
this
room
answered
alice
it
is
not
necessary
not
necessary
well
now
i
should
say
it
the
one
thing
you
ought
to
have
in
every
room
a
long
that
you
can
see
yourself
in
from
top
to
toe
why
half
your
elegance
is
lost
if
you
can
not
see
how
you
look
your
own
self
is
there
one
in
any
other
room
in
mother
i
think
and
where
that
room
situated
my
jewel
asked
kitty
oh
at
the
other
end
of
the
passage
but
really
kitty
kitty
however
was
off
alice
stayed
in
her
room
too
disgusted
to
follow
her
something
must
be
done
to
put
a
stop
to
this
she
thought
of
course
mother
wo
keep
a
girl
of
that
sort
why
she
a
regular
wild
indian
i
shall
be
ashamed
to
take
her
out
this
afternoon
but
at
that
moment
a
high
voice
accompanied
by
peals
of
laughter
was
heard
shouting
for
alice
alice
mavourneen
come
along
this
minute
alice
come
quick
quick
why
it
enthralling
i
am
you
never
saw
anything
like
me
before
did
you
oh
the
blarney
stone
what
it
has
done
for
me
come
alice
come
come
quick
what
can
be
the
matter
called
denvers
from
downstairs
has
anything
happened
oh
it
only
me
dear
denvers
do
come
up
this
minute
my
dear
ducky
woman
and
see
me
i
found
a
dress
with
a
train
to
it
in
my
trunk
a
new
dress
from
dublin
and
i
in
it
and
beautiful
i
look
come
up
and
see
me
i
gazing
at
myself
in
your
glass
i
never
saw
anything
so
lovely
in
the
whole
course
of
my
life
denvers
and
alice
now
both
appeared
upon
the
scene
kitty
in
her
new
dress
with
a
train
nearly
a
foot
on
the
ground
was
stepping
backward
and
forward
before
the
long
glass
in
denvers
wardrobe
her
eyes
were
flashing
with
merriment
and
delight
her
small
arched
feet
were
dancing
a
de
in
and
out
of
the
many
flounces
which
befrilled
the
end
of
the
pink
dress
well
do
you
like
it
called
kitty
how
do
you
think
i
look
did
you
ever
see
anybody
more
elegant
in
all
your
born
days
oh
if
only
the
dear
old
dad
could
see
me
i
feel
as
if
i
must
kiss
myself
here
she
commenced
blowing
kisses
vigorously
at
the
gay
figure
reflected
in
the
glass
come
kitty
said
denvers
you
are
not
going
out
in
that
dress
and
why
not
my
dear
denvers
why
should
i
go
out
and
captivate
the
natives
that
what
a
pretty
girl
is
made
for
not
in
this
country
said
denvers
in
a
somewhat
severe
voice
it
can
not
be
done
kitty
you
are
much
too
young
to
wear
a
dress
of
that
sort
while
you
are
with
me
you
must
expect
to
be
guided
by
my
taste
and
wishes
but
dear
denvers
aunt
bridget
ordered
it
well
of
course
dear
you
can
wear
it
at
castle
malone
but
not
here
at
least
not
out
of
doors
yes
my
child
it
is
a
very
pretty
dress
but
i
do
understand
what
is
right
for
girls
to
appear
in
you
must
have
something
quieter
kitty
then
come
along
and
choose
for
me
said
kitty
who
was
as
as
she
was
and
volatile
come
straight
and
choose
for
alice
poor
child
is
troubled
with
the
sulks
what
do
you
mean
said
alice
indignantly
but
is
it
true
darling
you
have
such
a
frown
between
your
brows
and
it
does
improve
you
there
cheer
up
alice
honey
why
it
the
best
of
friends
i
want
to
be
with
you
but
you
do
like
me
not
a
bit
i
win
you
yet
alice
aroon
but
at
the
present
moment
you
saying
in
your
heart
a
nasty
forward
girl
that
is
and
i
am
ashamed
that
i
am
that
my
schoolfellows
should
see
me
with
the
likes
of
her
come
come
kitty
no
more
of
this
said
denvers
if
you
are
going
out
you
have
no
time
to
lose
yes
let
me
see
your
wardrobe
i
think
this
dress
is
the
best
but
you
are
not
expecting
me
to
go
out
in
the
open
air
without
a
body
said
kitty
and
there
nothing
but
a
skirt
to
this
i
suppose
i
may
wear
one
of
my
pretty
blouses
yes
that
skirt
and
a
nice
blouse
will
do
now
then
get
ready
both
of
you
as
quickly
as
you
can
kitty
remember
i
expect
your
things
to
be
put
away
tidily
to
be
sure
why
then
it
would
be
a
shame
to
spoil
all
these
pretty
garments
i
put
them
away
in
a
jiffy
and
come
down
looking
as
neat
as
a
new
pin
alice
who
had
brushed
out
her
hair
put
on
a
clean
collar
and
a
pair
of
cuffs
was
now
standing
waiting
for
her
friend
look
here
she
said
suddenly
will
you
be
long
putting
away
your
things
and
dressing
not
very
long
darling
but
i
must
curl
my
fringe
over
again
i
wish
you
would
wear
a
fringe
kitty
none
of
the
nice
girls
do
at
the
school
is
it
give
up
my
fringe
i
would
answered
kitty
what
a
show
i
be
why
look
at
my
forehead
it
too
high
for
the
lines
of
pure
beauty
now
when
the
fringe
comes
down
just
to
here
why
it
perfect
aunt
bridget
said
it
was
and
she
a
rare
judge
i
can
tell
you
she
was
a
beauty
in
her
youth
one
of
the
dublin
beauties
and
you
ca
go
to
any
city
for
fairer
women
than
are
to
be
found
in
dublin
i
tell
you
what
it
is
alice
i
see
you
are
in
a
flurry
to
be
off
can
i
overtake
you
you
can
said
alice
suddenly
you
can
come
to
me
at
bessie
challoner
house
bessie
challoner
what
a
pretty
name
challoner
i
like
that
answered
kitty
looking
thoughtful
and
where
her
house
aroon
what
part
of
the
neighborhood
is
it
situated
in
come
here
to
the
window
and
i
show
you
when
you
leave
this
house
you
turn
to
the
right
and
walk
straight
on
until
you
come
to
cherry
lodge
that
the
name
of
the
house
bessie
and
i
will
be
waiting
for
you
well
then
off
you
go
and
i
wo
keep
you
many
minutes
alice
ran
out
of
the
room
she
found
her
mother
waiting
for
her
downstairs
oh
mother
said
alice
she
too
dreadful
come
now
no
whispering
about
me
behind
my
back
called
a
gay
voice
over
the
stairs
i
thought
it
would
be
something
of
that
sort
not
fair
out
with
your
remarks
in
front
of
me
and
nothing
behind
kitty
kitty
go
back
and
dress
you
incorrigible
child
called
denvers
mother
said
alice
my
dear
alice
said
her
mother
you
will
soon
learn
to
like
that
poor
child
she
has
a
great
deal
that
is
good
in
her
and
then
she
is
so
pretty
pretty
muttered
alice
oh
i
see
you
bewitched
like
the
rest
of
them
she
left
the
house
feeling
more
uncomfortable
depressed
and
angry
than
she
had
done
for
several
years
denvers
was
a
lawyer
and
made
a
fairly
good
income
but
his
large
family
and
the
education
of
his
boys
had
strained
his
resources
to
such
an
extent
that
he
was
very
glad
to
accept
the
liberal
sum
which
father
was
paying
for
her
alice
knew
all
about
this
and
at
first
was
more
than
willing
to
help
her
family
in
every
way
in
her
power
she
did
not
murmur
at
all
when
she
was
asked
to
give
up
half
of
her
room
to
the
irish
girl
she
was
quite
willing
to
take
her
under
her
patronage
to
show
her
round
to
try
to
get
friends
for
her
among
her
own
schoolfellows
in
short
to
make
her
happy
but
then
alice
had
never
pictured
any
one
in
the
least
like
kitty
malone
she
had
imagined
a
somewhat
plain
shy
awkward
girl
who
would
lean
upon
her
who
would
give
her
unbounded
affection
and
follow
her
lead
in
everything
now
this
sparkling
racy
daring
kitty
was
by
no
means
to
her
mind
there
was
not
the
least
doubt
that
kitty
would
not
be
guided
by
anybody
that
she
would
never
play
second
fiddle
and
there
was
also
a
dreadful
fear
down
deep
in
poor
alice
heart
that
she
would
fascinate
her
school
fellows
instead
of
disgusting
them
and
that
alice
own
dearest
friends
would
leave
her
in
favor
of
the
stranger
she
walked
very
slowly
therefore
a
frown
between
her
brows
discontent
and
jealousy
in
her
heart
bessie
was
waiting
for
her
at
the
gate
why
alice
called
out
bessie
how
late
you
are
we
sha
get
to
harley
grove
by
five
i
ca
help
being
late
it
is
a
blessing
you
see
me
now
answered
alice
i
wonder
you
waited
for
me
bessie
well
my
dear
answered
bessie
i
would
much
rather
walk
with
you
than
take
a
solitary
ramble
by
myself
i
thought
she
added
you
were
going
to
bring
that
new
irish
girl
with
you
has
she
come
has
she
not
come
answered
alice
oh
bessie
bessie
it
is
because
of
her
i
am
late
oh
bessie
she
is
quite
too
dreadful
how
so
asked
bessie
she
is
the
most
extraordinary
wild
reckless
absolutely
unladylike
vulgar
person
i
ever
came
across
in
the
whole
course
of
my
life
what
a
lot
of
adjectives
laughed
bessie
i
shall
be
quite
curious
to
see
her
from
your
description
she
must
be
a
monster
she
is
a
monster
a
human
monster
answered
alice
and
the
worst
of
it
is
bessie
that
in
some
extraordinary
way
she
has
fascinated
both
father
and
mother
and
even
fred
fred
who
hates
girls
as
a
rule
they
are
all
so
taken
up
with
this
blessed
kitty
malone
that
they
do
mind
her
perfectly
savage
manners
i
can
tell
you
i
am
quite
miserable
about
it
poor
alice
answered
bessie
in
a
sympathetic
tone
i
suppose
then
dear
she
is
not
coming
with
us
oh
yes
she
is
she
is
following
us
she
could
not
find
anything
quiet
enough
to
put
on
quiet
enough
to
put
on
what
do
you
mean
oh
my
dear
her
wardrobe
is
beyond
description
she
absolutely
wanted
to
come
to
poor
gwin
quiet
little
tea
party
in
a
dress
fit
for
a
ball
flounced
and
frilled
and
laced
and
ribboned
and
with
a
train
to
it
absolutely
a
train
although
she
is
not
fifteen
yet
bessie
could
not
help
laughing
i
am
sorry
she
is
fond
of
dress
she
answered
i
ca
bear
that
sort
of
girl
oh
you
positively
loathe
her
bessie
i
quite
pity
you
at
the
thought
of
having
to
walk
with
her
this
afternoon
my
dear
alice
we
must
make
the
best
of
it
answered
bessie
and
i
do
suppose
she
will
quite
kill
me
she
will
be
amusing
at
any
rate
amusing
enough
to
those
who
have
not
got
to
live
with
her
day
and
night
answered
alice
in
a
very
discontented
voice
oh
and
here
she
comes
she
added
and
look
she
is
running
and
racing
down
the
road
and
waving
her
hands
to
us
oh
bessie
it
is
intolerable
do
you
pity
me
what
is
that
the
girl
cried
bessie
how
very
how
very
what
asked
alice
how
very
pretty
she
is
pretty
said
alice
in
a
tone
of
such
withering
scorn
that
bessie
could
not
help
gazing
at
her
friend
in
astonishment
chapter
iv
tiffs
all
around
kitty
skirt
was
all
that
was
correct
and
proper
it
reached
just
to
her
ankles
and
her
remarkably
small
and
feet
were
encased
in
the
neatest
possible
tan
boots
but
the
blouse
of
light
pink
silk
all
bedizened
with
bunches
of
ribbons
and
lappets
of
lace
was
in
alice
eyes
almost
as
painfully
unsuitable
as
the
trained
skirt
kitty
wore
a
little
cap
of
velvet
on
her
head
her
hair
of
the
softest
cloudiest
black
true
irish
hair
was
piled
up
in
a
thick
mass
behind
in
front
it
waved
and
curled
round
her
white
forehead
kitty
was
very
tall
and
child
as
she
still
was
in
years
had
a
more
formed
figure
than
most
girls
of
her
age
she
was
drawing
on
her
tan
gloves
now
and
unfurling
a
parasol
of
tussore
silk
with
a
heavy
lace
fall
i
do
hope
i
smart
enough
she
said
panting
slightly
as
she
spoke
is
this
one
of
your
schoolfellows
yes
my

her
eyes

name

bessie

if
i

miss
it

but
miss

stiff
i
hope
i
may
be
kitty
to
you
and
then
you
wo
object
to
being
bessie
to
me
not
a
bit
answered
bessie
heartily
but
we
are
a
little
late
and
had
better
walk
on
as
fast
as
we
can
gwin
harley
lived
in
a
beautiful
house
about
two
miles
away
and
the
girls
turned
down
a
path
which
led
across
some
fields
in
the
direction
of
harley
grove
the
time
of
year
was
toward
the
end
of
may
and
the
weather
was
perfect
kitty
who
had
been
silent
for
a
time
now
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
field
threw
both
her
hands
to
her
sides
let
her
parasol
drop
on
the
ground
and
opened
her
mouth
wide
have
you
gone
quite
mad
asked
alice
in
a
severe
tone
mad
is
it
said
kitty
not
i
am
taking
in
some
of
the
air
here
she
began
to
breathe
very
deeply
and
with
considerable
noise
why
my
ducky
girls
the
pair
of
you
i
was
fairly
suffocated
in
that
bandbox
of
a
house
now
the
breeze
here
is
fine
and
fresh
and
i
want
to
fill
my
lungs
is
there
any
objection
oh
none
i
am
sure
answered
bessie
but
you
really
did
look
most
extraordinary
i
am
glad
no
one
was
passing
at
the
moment
said
alice
what
would
they
have
thought
does
it
matter
what
they
think
asked
kitty
we
never
mind
what
anyone
thinks
of
us
in
ireland
ah
the
dear
old
place
how
i
pine
for
it
there
now
my
lungs
are
full
and
we
can
go
on
again
she
picked
up
her
parasol
and
began
to
stride
forward
is
she
a
horror
whispered
alice
to
bessie
hush
answered
bessie
she
only
does
it
to
amuse
us
the
thing
is
to
take
very
little
notice
we
soon
tame
her
down
is
it
taming
me
you
after
called
back
kitty
well
then
never
do
that
for
i
come
of
a
wild
lot
and
i
have
always
been
called
wild
kitty
from
the
moment
i
could
speak
but
there
no
harm
in
me
not
a
bit
now
then
i
walk
as
sober
as
you
please
what
shall
we
talk
about
is
there
anything
you
would
like
to
ask
us
said
bessie
i
am
sure
then
darling
i
do
think
there
is
would
you
like
to
ask
me
some
questions
i
as
open
as
day
i
lay
bare
all
the
thoughts
of
my
secret
soul
to
the
pair
of
you
if
you
care
to
hear
them
i
do
know
that
we
do
said
bessie
you
see
we
have
got
to
make
your
acquaintance
yet
kitty
ah
now
it
nice
of
you
to
call
me
kitty
and
that
a
very
pretty
little
voice
you
have
soft
and
winning
how
is
it
you
say
some
of
those
words
i
ca
get
my
tongue
round
them
but
i
dare
say
i
will
after
a
bit
would
you
like
to
know
what
kind
of
place
we
are
going
to
asked
bessie
oh
i
wait
until
i
get
there
answered
kitty
i
suppose
it
like
all
other
places
there
a
house
and
some
girls
and
if
we
are
asked
to
tea
why
we
get
tea
and
they
think
me
no
end
of
an
oddity
and
i
think
them
a
lot
of
muffs
but
that
do
matter
oh
my
dears
if
you
only
saw
old
ireland
and
if
you
only
knew
the
free
life
we
have
there
and
the
beautiful
air
that
comes
blowing
in
from
the
broad
atlantic
why
it
smothered
i
be
in
this
queer
place
i
doubt
if
i
stay
long
i
write
to
father
and
ask
him
to
take
me
back
again
i
would
if
i
were
you
said
alice
stoutly
now
what
do
you
mean
by
that
aroon
i
mean
said
alice
who
had
now
almost
lost
control
over
her
temper
that
if
you
go
on
as
you
have
done
since
you
came
here
we
shall
none
of
us
like
you
and
i
for
one
shall
be
delighted
when
you
return
to
ireland
as
alice
spoke
kitty
charming
face
suddenly
lost
its
brilliant
color
it
became
white
and
her
dark
eyes
flashed
with
an
angry
fire
she
stood
perfectly
still
for
a
moment
then
began
to
walk
on
a
little
faster
than
before
you
have
hurt
her
alice
said
bessie
you
should
not
have
said
that
i
do
care
she
made
me
do
it
she
is
intolerable
still
you
had
no
right
to
speak
as
you
did
remember
she
is
a
stranger
here
bessie
ran
after
kitty
and
tried
to
slip
her
hand
through
her
arm
but
the
irish
girl
made
an
impatient
movement
and
shrugging
her
shoulders
walked
on
quicker
than
before
oh
leave
her
alone
whispered
alice
let
us
talk
about
things
that
interest
us
why
should
all
lives
be
upset
by
her
there
she
is
going
on
in
front
let
us
fall
back
and
talk
about
interesting
things
have
you
finished
your
work
yet
oh
yes
i
had
a
great
deal
to
do
this
afternoon
i
do
hope
alice
that
gwin
wo
mind
if
i
ask
her
to
let
me
go
into
the
library
i
must
take
a
peep
into
encyclopædia
it
is
such
a
chance
oh
i
am
sure
she
wo
mind
replied
alice
gwin
is
the
soul
of
good
nature
i
only
dread
what
she
will
think
oh
you
need
not
dread
anything
said
kitty
suddenly
turning
round
and
coming
back
to
the
girls
i
sha
be
here
long
do
be
afraid
please
kitty
said
bessie
do
mind
what
alice
said
just
now
she
was
vexed
because
we
are
not
quite
accustomed
to
manners
like
yours
you
will
soon
get
into
our
ways
you
know
never
never
cried
kitty
well
at
any
rate
do
mind
about
it
now
do
you
think
you
will
like
your
school
life
no
i
shall
just
hate
it
what
a
pity
that
will
be
but
i
sure
you
do
know
what
you
are
saying
you
are
vexed
with
alice
and
i
do
wonder
alice
you
were
very
hard
on
her
oh
never
mind
answered
kitty
do
ask
her
to
apologize
i
can
go
home
again
i
do
want
to
be
with
people
who
have
made
up
their
minds
to
dislike
me
all
the
folks
at
home
love
me
and
here
tears
dropped
from
her
eyes
splashing
down
her
cheeks
in
bright
round
pearls
i
did
mean
to
vex
you
said
alice
who
was
disconcerted
at
this
evident
grief
i
dare
say
i
shall
get
accustomed
to
you
after
a
bit
i
mean
i
do
not
really
want
you
to
go
home
kitty
face
underwent
a
change
rapid
as
a
flash
of
lightning
if
you
want
to
make
friends
alice
it
as
right
as
rain
she
cried
i
know
i
was
vexed
but
it
is
over
now
yes
it
is
over
i
am
willing
to
be
friends
if
you
are
willing
of
course
said
alice
and
i
know
i
ought
not
to
have
spoken
as
i
did
but
you
do
manage
to
fret
me
dreadfully
i
never
saw
a
girl
exactly
like
you
before
it
is
all
right
now
you
really
want
to
be
friends
answered
kitty
and
i
will
try
to
be
as
dull
as
you
please
here
she
paused
and
seemed
to
consider
there
no
use
she
continued
after
a
moment
i
mean
i
must
be
myself
whatever
happens
i
must
be
genuine
please
alice
let
me
be
genuine
for
a
week
if
at
the
end
of
that
time
you
find
me
intolerable
why
i
be
off
do
say
anything
about
that
said
bessie
everything
is
quite
new
to
you
and
alice
did
speak
unkindly
but
please
kitty
do
be
angry
if
i
say
something
oh
no
i
wo
be
angry
with
you
you
a
real
duck
cried
kitty
well
we
english
girls
are
not
quite
accustomed
to
your
sort
of
way
we
are
quieter
here
and
more
reserved
perhaps
you
had
better
oh
i
know
exactly
what
the
end
of
that
pretty
little
speech
is
going
to
be
said
kitty
but
i
can
not
i
must
be
kitty
malone
or
nothing
i
was
born
that
way
why
bless
you
it
is
in
our
race
aunt
bridget
was
just
the
same
when
she
was
young
and
so
was
aunt
honora
and
even
father
oh
and
and
laurie
if
you
only
saw
laurie
and
pat
oh
i
wish
you
knew
laurie
if
you
saw
him
you
would
say
there
is
a
broth
of
a
boy
in
the
world
he
is
one
the
girls
had
now
reached
the
avenue
gates
at
harley
lodge
and
the
ran
out
to
open
them
a
few
moments
later
they
found
themselves
in
sight
of
the
pretty
modern
mansion
which
harley
had
lately
purchased
the
door
was
opened
by
a
butler
in
very
correct
livery
and
the
young
folk
were
shown
into
a
handsome
at
the
other
side
of
a
broad
hall
there
was
no
one
in
the
room
when
they
entered
and
kitty
walked
straight
up
to
a
glass
let
into
the
wall
and
began
to
survey
herself
with
intense
satisfaction
she
had
by
this
time
forgotten
the
rebuff
which
alice
had
given
her
tears
had
only
added
to
the
brightness
of
her
eyes
and
her
momentary
fit
of
vexation
and
temper
had
deepened
the
color
in
her
blooming
cheeks
she
nodded
to
herself
with
smiles
of
intense
satisfaction
pushed
her
velvet
cap
in
a
slightly
more
coquettish
way
over
her
mass
of
black
curls
and
began
once
again
to
dance
a
very
graceful
de
in
front
of
the
glass
i
do
think
i
have
nice
feet
she
said
and
just
at
that
moment
the
door
was
opened
and
gwin
harley
and
elma
lewis
entered
the
room
gwin
statuesque
graceful
dressed
in
the
most
suitable
manner
made
a
perfect
contrast
to
poor
excitable
kitty
kitty
words
had
been
plainly
audible
and
alice
flushed
deeply
with
vexation
why
then
i
had
better
introduce
myself
said
kitty
who
was
by
no
means
abashed
are
you
miss
harley
you
have
got
a
very
nice
looking
glass
let
me
tell
you
it
shows
off
the
figure
to
perfection
gwin
could
not
help
coloring
in
surprise
and
astonishment
i
am
kitty
malone
at
your
service
continued
kitty
shall
i
drop
you
a
courtesy
in
the
true
irish
way
some
of
us
bob
like
this
so
and
some
of
us
step
back
like
this
here
kitty
performed
a
very
elaborate
and
very
graceful
courtesy
then
stood
upright
and
laughing
heartily
showed
rows
of
pearly
teeth
gwin
held
out
her
hand
may
i
introduce
my
friend
elma
lewis
elma
this
is
miss
malone
kitty
malone
i
wo
be
called
miss
malone
said
the
incorrigible
kitty
wo
you
all
come
upstairs
now
girls
said
gwin
who
perceived
that
both
alice
and
bessie
were
annoyed
by
kitty
manners
if
we
take
off
our
things
we
can
go
into
the
library
and
have
a
good
game
before
tea
or
would
you
prefer
a
walk
well
i
for
one
am
tired
said
kitty
the
fact
is
she
continued
these
boots
are
somewhat
tight
they
awfully
becoming
you
know
are
they
but
they
do
squeeze
a
little
just
across
the
toes
how
ever
as
aunt
honora
says
feels
no
pain
and
i
am
desperate
proud
of
my
feet
shall
we
all
look
at
our
feet
and
see
which
has
got
the
prettiest
pair
i
do
think
we
will
just
at
present
said
gwin
if
you
are
tired
you
must
take
your
boots
off
have
you
not
just
come
from
ireland
bless
you
yes
answered
kitty
i
only
arrived
the
place
is
as
new
to
me
as
it
can
be
up
to
the
present
i
do
think
much
of
it
although
you
have
got
a
lovely
house
miss
harley
fine
and
airy
with
plenty
of
big
rooms
i
suppose
you
have
got
money
have
you
i
believe
we
have
said
gwin
in
some
astonishment
and
a
haughty
note
coming
into
her
voice
ah
now
do
begin
to
be
proud
and
stiff
exclaimed
kitty
it
is
quite
wonderful
every
one
i
speak
to
here
seems
to
take
me
the
wrong
way
what
in
the
world
do
you
all
mean
i
thought
when
i
came
to
england
that
people
would
say
now
that
a
remarkably
pretty
girl
i
am
sure
she
irish
by
the
twinkle
in
her
eye
and
the
roll
of
the
brogue
in
her
voice
but
we
like
her
all
the
better
for
that
but
bless
my
heart
that
not
the
way
you
taking
me
every
time
i
open
my
lips
somebody
seems
to
think
i
have
said
something
wrong
upon
my
word
it
a
nice
state
of
things
and
i
the
darling
of
my
old
father
if
aunt
honora
and
aunt
bridget
were
here
they
would
soon
put
matters
straight
and
laurie
dear
darling
old
laurie
if
he
saw
his
kitty
put
upon
would
he
give
it
to
you
all
we
none
of
us
want
to
put
upon
you
miss
malone
said
gwin
harley
malone
yes
said
gwin
firmly
it
is
the
custom
here
to
call
girls
by
their
surnames
for
a
little
until
we
get
to
know
them
but
i
am
sure
she
added
kindly
you
will
soon
be
kitty
with
us
all
for
i
see
you
are
very
nice
although
you
have
not
quite
our
ways
ah
there
that
is
all
i
want
you
to
say
answered
kitty
with
a
profound
sigh
and
now
i
go
upstairs
and
slip
off
my
bits
of
boots
for
they
are
a
trifle
tight
can
you
lend
me
a
pair
of
your
shoes
miss
harley
yes
with
pleasure
replied
gwin
and
turning
she
led
the
way
out
of
the
room
the
rest
of
the
evening
passed
off
better
kitty
became
a
little
subdued
and
satisfied
herself
with
talking
less
and
casting
ravishing
glances
of
delight
and
roguish
entreaty
first
at
one
girl
and
then
at
the
other
it
was
extremely
difficult
to
withstand
her
for
her
voice
was
low
and
singularly
sweet
her
eyes
were
beautiful
she
could
not
do
an
ungraceful
thing
she
was
altogether
like
a
bright
flashing
meteor
and
soon
she
began
to
exercise
an
extraordinary
fascination
both
over
bessie
challoner
and
gwin
harley
having
got
over
her
first
astonishment
gwin
began
to
take
a
sincere
interest
in
the
pretty
stranger
the
lovely
expression
of
her
coral
lips
made
her
long
to
kiss
them
and
to
assure
the
irish
girl
that
she
for
one
would
be
her
friend
but
the
next
instant
kitty
said
something
so
very
much
against
the
grain
that
gwin
felt
as
much
repulsed
as
a
moment
before
she
was
delighted
immediately
after
tea
bessie
went
off
to
the
library
to
hunt
up
her
darling
encyclopædia
now
that
she
has
gone
exclaimed
gwin
we
are
not
likely
to
get
her
back
for
some
time
what
a
remarkably
earnest
student
she
is
the
earnest
student
interrupted
kitty
i
thought
that
was
the
name
of
a
religious
book
i
think
father
has
got
it
at
home
perhaps
so
replied
gwin
but
we
always
call
it
to
bessie
she
is
wonderfully
clever
she
gets
on
splendidly
at
school
taking
everything
before
her
i
am
certain
she
is
the
kind
of
girl
who
will
make
her
mark
by
and
by
i
hate
studies
said
kitty
in
her
low
humorous
voice
i
am
sorry
for
that
answered
gwin
for
if
you
come
to
school
you
wo
be
at
all
popular
if
you
do
not
care
for
your
books
popular
how
do
you
mean
is
it
with
the
teachers
or
with
the
girls
well
with
both
i
fancy
then
i
tell
you
what
exclaimed
kitty
i
like
to
bet
with
you
that
you
are
wrong
that
i
be
the
most
popular
girl
in
the
whole
of
the
school
with
the
teachers
yes
with
the
teachers
and
the
scholars
as
well
you
must
be
very
conceited
exclaimed
elma
who
had
sat
silent
during
the
greater
part
of
the
evening
taking
kitty
in
however
all
the
same
conceited
no
more
than
you
are
cried
kitty
but
i
know
my
powers
and
i
have
not
kissed
the
blarney
stone
for
nothing
oh
you
need
not
tell
us
that
ridiculous
story
over
again
said
alice
but
i
should
like
to
hear
it
cried
gwin
you
really
would
not
gwin
it
is
too
absurd
we
must
show
kitty
now
she
has
come
to
live
among
us
what
is
real
wit
and
what
is
not
her
way
of
talking
is
only
silly
gwin
knit
her
brows
and
looked
pained
i
would
rather
not
correct
her
now
she
said
in
a
gentle
voice
then
she
added
her
eyes
sparkling
with
sudden
eagerness
would
it
not
be
a
good
opportunity
for
talking
over
the
rules
of
our
society
girls
oh
yes
cried
elma
yes
but
is
it
well
to
here
she
bent
forward
and
began
to
whisper
vigorously
in
gwin
ear
yes
i
think
so
answered
gwin
i
would
i
really
would
said
elma
i
am
certain
alice
agrees
with
me
i
can
guess
what
you
are
saying
cried
alice
and
i
do
agree
most
heartily
and
i
can
guess
what
you
are
saying
exclaimed
kitty
starting
to
her
feet
with
flashing
eyes
you
do
want
to
talk
about
your
society
or
whatever
it
is
because
i
am
present
well
discuss
it
without
me
find
my
way
to
the
library
poor
dear
bessie
is
the
only
decent
one
among
you
and
i
shall
go
and
sit
with
her
how
do
you
know
i
wo
take
up
with
literature
just
to
spite
you
all
i
can
do
anything
i
have
a
mind
to
and
that
you
will
soon
find
to
your
cost
she
ran
out
of
the
room
as
she
spoke
slamming
the
door
behind
her
there
that
a
comfort
cried
alice
breathing
freely
for
the
first
time
did
you
ever
girls
in
all
your
lives
see
a
more
terrible
creature
what
is
to
be
done
why
she
will
disgrace
us
all
at
school
you
know
what
a
very
nice
set
we
are
in
at
present
oh
an
excellent
set
said
elma
in
a
sarcastic
voice
you
know
elma
that
we
do
belong
to
the
nicest
set
in
the
school
and
i
am
sure
gwin
your
father
you
need
not
drag
father
in
cried
gwin
father
likes
all
the
people
i
like
but
surely
began
alice
gwin
looked
at
her
gravely
then
she
nodded
i
am
not
quite
certain
yet
she
said
but
i
think
it
highly
probable
that
i
shall
take
up
that
poor
wild
little
kitty
at
least
she
is
fresh
she
speaks
out
her
mind
plainly
and
there
is
a
great
deal
to
admire
about
her
then
listen
gwin
cried
alice
if
she
is
taken
into
our
special
society
i
will
resign
will
you
really
alice
what
if
i
ask
you
to
stay
it
is
hard
to
refuse
you
dear
but
you
scarcely
know
what
all
this
means
to
me
i
am
rubbed
the
wrong
way
i
do
understand
myself
but
frankly
gwin
you
are
not
going
to
ask
kitty
malone
to
join
our
society
what
if
it
does
her
good
but
ought
we
not
to
think
of
the
others
she
is
a
perfect
stranger
to
us
all
at
present
but
she
wo
be
long
bless
the
child
she
has
no
reserve
in
her
and
i
do
want
to
help
her
poor
little
girl
well
we
need
not
decide
that
point
at
present
do
let
us
vote
to
leave
her
out
cried
alice
no
alice
we
will
leave
the
point
undecided
now
let
us
set
to
work
and
begin
to
form
our
rules
for
really
we
have
no
time
to
lose
but
what
are
we
to
do
without
bessie
exclaimed
alice
whatever
happens
we
can
not
do
without
bessie
challoner
she
will
be
the
life
and
soul
of
the
whole
society
shall
we
send
for
her
gwin
no
kitty
is
with
her
and
they
had
better
not
be
disturbed
what
a
difference
kitty
makes
cried
alice
i
did
think
we
should
have
had
a
delightful
and
heavenly
evening
and
it
has
been
all
ruction
from
first
to
last
because
you
dislike
her
so
much
alice
said
gwin
well
i
do
said
alice
i
ca
abide
her
but
do
i
show
my
dislike
so
plainly
she
added
rather
any
one
can
see
it
in
the
curl
of
your
lip
and
the
expression
in
your
eyes
and
then
you
say
such
terribly
withering
things
to
the
poor
girl
you
try
to
crush
her
well
if
i
may
say
what
i
think
cried
elma
kitty
malone
seems
to
me
to
be
a
very
unpleasant
vulgar
girl
and
i
can
not
imagine
why
she
has
been
sent
here
oh
as
to
her
vulgarity
said
alice
who
suddenly
felt
forced
to
defend
herself
against
elma
spiteful
speeches
kitty
comes
of
a
very
old
family
and
her
father
is
as
rich
as
ever
he
can
be
they
live
in
a
wonderful
castle
in
county
donegal
just
overhanging
the
sea
and
from
what
i
learn
are
considered
county
people
father
was
very
pleased
to
have
her
and
whatever
she
is
she
is
a
lady
by
birth
so
she
is
rich
remarked
elma
in
a
low
voice
well
at
any
rate
she
continued
after
a
pause
she
is
very
pretty
pretty
cried
gwin
i
should
just
think
she
is
she
has
the
most
lovely
face
i
ever
saw
girls
it
is
quite
true
what
she
says
she
will
fascinate
any
number
of
people
that
dashing
daring
way
of
hers
will
go
down
with
numbers
yes
she
will
make
a
revolution
in
middleton
school
i
am
certain
chapter
v
incorrigible
kitty
harley
library
was
a
beautiful
room
it
was
lined
with
books
from
floor
to
ceiling
and
these
books
had
been
selected
with
the
greatest
care
standard
works
of
all
sorts
and
in
three
languages
were
to
be
found
on
certain
bookshelves
also
modern
works
both
poetry
and
prose
with
some
of
the
best
novels
of
the
day
bessie
challoner
never
envied
rich
people
she
cared
nothing
whatever
for
fine
dresses
nor
for
carriages
and
horses
nor
for
the
luxurious
life
of
the
wealthy
but
she
did
envy
gwin
harley
the
use
of
her
father
library
and
when
she
entered
the
room
now
with
that
delicious
faint
smell
of
leather
which
all
libraries
possess
she
sniffed
first
with
ecstasy
and
then
climbing
on
the
ladder
secured
the
volume
of
the
encyclopædia
which
she
required
and
seating
herself
at
one
of
the
center
tables
was
soon
lost
in
the
fascinations
of
her
subject
after
a
time
a
little
cough
very
gentle
however
caused
her
to
raise
her
head
and
there
standing
before
her
was
kitty
malone
kitty
long
arms
had
dropped
to
her
sides
and
she
had
pushed
back
her
masses
of
dark
hair
there
was
a
pathetic
expression
about
her
rosy
lips
and
tears
trembled
on
her
long
eyelashes
why
what
is
it
kitty
what
do
you
want
asked
bessie
ah
then
it
good
to
hear
you
say
that
word
aroon
said
kitty
i
want
to
sit
near
you
i
wo
speak
no
not
a
syllable
hush
will
be
the
only
word
with
me
hush
hush
hush
you
can
go
on
with
your
beloved
reading
and
i
stay
near
you
that
all
i
require
why
then
just
a
shelter
i
need
and
nothing
more
read
away
bessie
my
honey
and
i
do
nothing
to
interrupt
you
but
why
have
you
left
the
others
asked
bessie
never
mind
dear
now
i
just
sit
quietly
here
and
contemplate
you
while
you
are
studying
bessie
sighed
impatiently
she
then
bent
again
over
her
book
and
began
to
devour
the
pages
kitty
watched
her
with
marked
interest
i
wonder
if
it
will
be
my
fate
to
have
to
take
up
with
literature
in
sober
earnest
she
said
to
herself
i
who
can
never
abide
a
book
oh
to
be
back
again
in
the
dear
old
place
i
should
not
be
a
bit
surprised
if
laurie
is
out
fishing
now
and
pat
with
him
and
oh
suppose
they
are
bringing
in
the
trout
and
the
creatures
are
leaping
and
struggling
as
they
come
to
shore
and
father
is
going
round
to
feed
the
dogs
why
the
thought
is
enough
to
madden
me
oh
then
why
did
i
ever
leave
home
i
do
care
for
books
nor
for
being
clever
nor
for
how
she
works
to
be
sure
how
earnest
she
looks
she
has
got
a
very
fine
forehead
although
it
is
miles
too
high
she
ought
to
wear
a
fringe
it
would
improve
her
wonderfully
i
will
cut
her
hair
some
day
if
she
will
let
me
i
will
cut
it
and
curl
it
i
have
got
the
dearest
little
jewel
of
a
pair
of
curling
tongs
that
ever
was
seen
aunt
honora
sent
it
to
me
in
a
box
with
a
spirit
lamp
all
complete
when
i
got
the
rest
of
my
things
i
just
exercise
those
little
tongs
on
dear
nice
bessie
i
do
wish
she
would
not
be
so
devoted
to
that
book
she
might
talk
oh
i
am
lonely
i
think
i
fidget
a
bit
kitty
moved
her
chair
creaking
it
ominously
but
bessie
had
got
to
a
most
thrilling
part
of
her
subject
and
kitty
might
have
creaked
the
library
down
before
she
would
have
roused
her
companion
attention
now
if
i
sigh
perhaps
that
will
do
it
thought
kitty
she
opened
her
mouth
and
let
some
profound
sighs
come
up
from
the
depths
of
her
heart
but
they
only
depressed
her
still
more
and
had
no
effect
whatever
on
bessie
i
think
i
hate
intellectual
people
muttered
the
irish
girl
she
jumped
to
her
feet
i
must
do
something
to
rouse
her
or
i
shall
go
mad
she
is
the
nicest
of
them
all
much
i
wish
she
would
speak
to
me
why
should
i
break
my
heart
and
why
should
she
simply
go
on
devouring
that
stupid
book
here
i
know
what
i
do
i
just
toss
down
one
of
the
big
volumes
it
will
make
a
clatter
and
she
will
have
to
look
up
perhaps
i
let
it
drop
just
the
tiniest
bit
in
the
world
on
the
corner
of
her
toe
that
will
finish
her
here
kitty
laughed
excitedly
pushed
out
her
arm
and
knocked
over
a
huge
volume
which
certainly
fell
a
good
deal
more
than
a
tiny
bit
on
poor
bessie
foot
oh
kitty
what
have
you
done
cried
bessie
you
have
quite
hurt
me
i
wish
you
would
not
drop
the
books
about
there
darling
i
had
to
do
it
pray
forgive
me
said
kitty
you
had
to
do
it
answered
bessie
do
you
mean
that
you
did
it
on
purpose
why
then
yes
love
that
what
i
do
mean
exactly
i
did
it
because
i
wanted
you
to
talk
to
me
and
you
think
of
nothing
but
that
book
it
is
such
a
chance
answered
bessie
and
i
wanted
to
find
out
for
myself
all
about
that
wonderful
magnetic
iron
you
know
it
never
loses
its
power
it
is
potent
for
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
years
and
oh
do
tell
me
any
more
or
i
lose
my
senses
dear
bessie
what
does
magnetic
iron
ore
matter
bessie
i
awfully
unhappy
every
one
is
so
unkind
to
me
promise
you
be
my
friend
wo
you
bessie
looked
up
and
then
she
saw
something
so
touching
in
kitty
face
that
she
closed
her
book
with
a
reluctant
sigh
to
devote
herself
the
next
moment
with
all
the
sympathy
she
possessed
to
her
companion
i
am
sure
you
are
suffering
kitty
and
i
am
sorry
for
you
she
said
i
fetch
my
hat
and
we
go
out
for
a
little
oh
what
a
darling
you
are
answered
kitty
a
moment
or
two
later
the
girls
were
walking
across
the
garden
they
soon
reached
a
shady
path
at
the
further
end
and
now
kitty
said
bessie
i
mean
to
lecture
you
a
little
anything
in
the
world
you
like
darling
i
quite
agreeable
aunt
honora
and
aunt
bridget
lecture
me
and
so
does
the
dear
old
dad
sometimes
but
i
always
say
when
they
have
finished
that
it
is
like
water
on
a
duck
back
it
rolls
off
without
making
the
least
bit
of
impression
and
then
they
laugh
and
say
that
i
am
the
queerest
mixture
they
ever
came
across
and
that
they
had
best
leave
me
to
nature
but
perhaps
i
listen
to
you
bessie
i
wish
you
would
said
bessie
i
am
sure
she
added
speaking
with
great
earnestness
that
you
are
a
very
nice
girl
kitty
but
at
the
same
time
you
are
wild
oh
i
pride
myself
on
that
said
kitty
in
her
frankest
of
voices
but
i
wish
you
would
not
kitty
for
it
really
is
nice
not
nice
now
what
may
you
be
meaning
by
that
aroon
well
there
is
a
sort
of
dignity
which
i
think
a
really
well
girl
ought
to
possess
oh
my
dignity
is
it
said
kitty
she
stepped
away
from
her
companion
drew
down
her
face
to
a
ridiculous
length
nearly
closed
her
eyes
and
folded
her
hands
demurely
across
her
breast
is
that
pleasing
you
mavourneen
she
said
is
it
dignified
and
sober
enough
poor
kitty
malone
looks
now
oh
kitty
you
will
joke
about
everything
kitty
immediately
changed
her
mood
no
i
wo
she
said
i
am
really
awfully
obliged
to
you
you
know
what
all
this
has
been
to
me
father
said
i
was
growing
too
wild
yes
the
darling
dad
did
he
agrees
with
you
down
to
the
core
of
his
heart
and
he
said
i
must
go
to
england
and
be
taught
manners
but
bless
you
they
have
a
job
i
told
him
so
when
i
was
going
i
said
it
the
hearts
of
the
teachers
i
be
breaking
and
dad
said
no
you
wo
kitty
aroon
you
be
a
good
girl
and
you
try
to
please
your
old
dad
and
you
come
back
a
beautiful
perfect
lady
he
said
it
with
tears
in
his
eyes
he
did
the
darling
and
i
promised
and
down
on
my
knees
i
went
and
asked
god
to
help
me
but
dear
like
the
froth
of
the
inside
me
the
fun
and
the
mischief
and
the
nonsense
and
the
ways
that
you
think
queer
but
all
the
same
those
ways
delight
the
good
folk
at
home
must
i
really
give
them
up
bessie
must
i
to
a
certain
extent
said
bessie
or
you
will
have
a
lot
of
enemies
here
kitty
and
you
wo
be
at
all
happy
how
i
wish
i
lived
with
you
bessie
challoner
you
a
broth
of
a
girl
that
you
are
you
have
not
taken
a
dislike
to
me
just
because
of
the
fun
bubbling
up
in
my
heart
no
dear
on
the
contrary
i
like
you
extremely
ah
you
precious
duck
of
a
darling
it
is
a
good
squeeze
you
would
like
if
i
gave
it
to
you
well
i
am
not
very
fond
of
being
kissed
but
if
you
must
kitty
i
must
dear
i
must
for
the
heart
in
me
is
full
to
the
brim
now
then
stand
still
and
i
catch
you
up
close
to
my
heart
there
that
better
poor
bessie
gave
some
breaths
for
the
firmness
in
fact
the
ferocity
of
kitty
embrace
quite
hurt
her
for
a
moment
there
said
kitty
that
the
way
we
hug
in
old
ireland
now
i
a
sight
better
and
i
let
go
so
you
do

kitty
only

it
again

that

it
i
wish
you
could
see
aunt
honora
and
aunt
bridget

one
another
why

noise
they
make
when
they
get
together
and
the
way
they
kiss
oh
dear
i
hope
some
day
you
come
to
ireland

do
tempt
me
by
these
descriptions
replied
bessie
but
now
kitty
will
you
promise
just
to
be
a
little
quieter
to
keep
in
all
those
irrepressible
and
really
i
must
say
it
dear
at
the
risk
of
hurting
you
those
silly
words
but
then
i
silly
myself
said
kitty

expect
wisdom

of
nonsense

and
simple

first
to
last
but

do
want
to
be
something
better

do
want
to
lead
a
good
life
a
good
life

never
thought
there
was
anything
bad
in
me
you
want
to
learn
for
instance
no
that
i
do
darling
you
do
want
to
learn
kitty
then
what
is
the
good
of
coming
to
middleton
school

said
kitty
i
do
anything
for
father
father
said
i
was
to
learn
and
that
i
was
to
get
manners
now
i
think
your
manners
are
perfect
i
model
myself
on
you
dear
that
i
will
will
you
teach
me
your
manners
bessie
challoner
i
do
all
i
can
to
help
you
kitty
and
you
be
my
real
faithful
friend
yes
only
please
not
i
wo
dear
i
wo
but
when
i
meet
you
allow
me
just
once
well
if
it
will
break
you
in
it
will
it
will
it
will
enable
me
to
bear
alice
i
am
not
the
sort
to
hate
people
but
i
soon
get
to
hate
her
it
an
awful
affliction
that
i
have
got
to
live
with
the
denvers
not
that
denvers
is
bad
nor
denvers
poor
dear
nor
fred
but
alice
i
like
to
get
alice
over
to
ireland
to
castle
malone
i
could
punish
her
a
bit
if
i
put
her
into
laurie
hands
but
there
well
kitty
time
is
going
said
bessie
it
is
a
bargain
that
i
help
you
to
learn
some
of
our
english
ways
and
that
you
in
order
to
pay
me
try
to
be
gentle
yourself
and
to
restrain
some
of
your
wild
words
i
try
i
do
my
very
very
best
you
see
when
i
get
to
middleton
school
what
a
proper
respectable
sort
of
girl
i
become
and
you
work
hard
too
wo
you
kitty
for
i
know
it
will
do
you
a
great
deal
of
good
and
i
am
sure
you
are
very
intelligent
well
i
can
take
in
most
things
only
it
no
end
of
a
bother
i
am
certain
you
will
succeed
if
you
try
said
bessie
then
it
a
bargain
is
it
you
try
to
learn
a
great
deal
and
you
will
do
your
best
to
get
better
mannered
why
of
course
i
will
i
hate
learning
and
i
do
want
to
be
bothered
with
lessons
but
there
nothing
under
the
sun
i
would
do
for
those
i
love
and
i
love
father
and
i
love
you
too
bessie
challoner
they
are
calling
us
we
must
go
into
the
house
said
bessie
do
yield
to
me
on
one
point
cried
kitty
what
is
that
let
us
go
back
to
the
house
with
our
arms
round
each
other
waists
it
will
show
alice
that
we
have
come
to
an
understanding
i
do
care
twopence
about
miss
harley
nor
about
that
other
girl
i
do
remember
her
name
but
i
want
alice
to
see
us
why
it
mad
with
jealousy
be
come
along
aroon
here
my
arm
firm
round
your
waist
now
let
us
dance
up
to
the
house
oh
kitty
kitty
you
are
incorrigible
cried
poor
bessie
and
a
feeling
of
despair
certainly
visited
her
at
that
moment
chapter
vi
the
a
few
days
after
the
events
related
in
the
last
chapter
alice
denvers
bessie
challoner
elma
lewis
and
gwin
harley
met
once
more
at
pretty
home
to
discuss
the
rules
of
a
little
society
which
they
were
drawing
up
among
themselves
the
nicest
girls
in
their
set
were
to
be
invited
to
join
but
the
important
subject
of
the
rules
was
first
to
be
discussed
gwin
drawn
up
a
plan
which
she
now
submitted
to
her
eager
companions
the
most
important
thing
of
all
is
the
name
she
said
i
thought
of
calling
it
early
rising
devoted
to
study
society
oh
twice
too
long
said
bessie
who
could
be
bothered
saying
all
these
words
you
know
when
we
are
in
the
rush
of
we
can
not
be
bothered
talking
of
the
rising
devoted
to
study
it
would
never
never
do
we
must
express
what
we
mean
in
a
single
word
if
necessary
then
let
us
get
one
said
gwin
you
have
not
the
least
idea
what
a
headache
i
had
last
night
searching
in
the
dictionary
and
cudgelling
my
brains
but
a
sensible
word
which
would
express
all
our
meaning
i
could
not
get
let
us
think
what
our
meaning
clearly
is
said
elma
do
you
know
that
yet
exclaimed
bessie
the
society
is
to
be
formed
as
an
incentive
to
make
us
work
extra
hard
you
know
she
added
i
always
think
the
motives
of
are
quite
wrong
oh
do
listen
to
the
words
of
miss
wisdom
said
elma
in
a
very
mocking
tone
bessie
big
gray
eyes
flashed
for
a
moment
with
indignation
but
she
soon
recovered
her
usual
calm
i
think
the
motives
of
school
are
wrong
she
repeated
there
are
prizes
offered
and
there
is
a
lot
of
emulation
and
how
could
we
live
without
emulation
cried
alice
why
it
is
the
very
breath
of
life
but
the
desire
of
each
to
excel
the
other
is
not
surely
why
we
are
sent
to
school
continued
bessie
we
are
sent
to
school
because
our
parents
want
us
to
learn
something
they
do
want
us
specially
to
get
prizes
although
they
are
glad
when
we
do
because
they
suppose
that
we
have
accomplished
some
of
the
objects
of
our
school
life
but
their
real
wish
is
that
we
should
know
english
history
and
history
generally
that
we
should
be
well
acquainted
with
geography
that
we
should
speak
french
fluently
and
understand
german
so
as
to
be
able
to
converse
in
that
tongue
and
to
read
the
literature
oh
do
listen
to
the
bookworm
cried
elma
in
short
continued
bessie
that
we
should
become
accomplished
women
that
is
undoubtedly
the
real
object
of
school
well
we
are
not
gainsaying
it
said
gwin
we
all
know
dear
bessie
what
you
feel
about
learning
it
is
the
breath
of
life
to
you
it
is
i
rejoice
in
it
said
bessie
a
good
vigorous
tussle
with
a
tough
subject
is
the
keenest
pleasure
which
i
can
possibly
have
but
the
rest
of
us
are
not
made
the
same
way
continued
gwin
now
i
like
my
studies
very
much
that
is
in
moderation
when
i
am
learning
and
mastering
french
and
getting
through
my
music
creditably
and
in
short
going
through
the
usual
curriculum
of
work
i
feel
interested
but
i
also
have
a
delightful
sense
that
if
i
work
for
so
many
hours
i
am
entitled
to
play
for
so
many
hours
oh
bother
the
play
interrupted
bessie
you
see
bessie
challoner
that
is
the
difference
between
us
i
like
work
just
to
form
part
of
my
life
but
not
the
whole
you
want
work
to
form
the
whole
of
your
life
yes
that
i
do
said
bessie
but
now
to
return
to
the
society
interrupted
elma
we
all
know
that
it
wo
be
the
slightest
effort
to
bessie
to
join
but
she
will
be
a
good
incentive
to
the
rest
of
us
she
will
always
be
at
the
top
of
the
tree
at
the
head
of
her
class
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
she
require
to
be
told
to
get
up
early
because
she
always
does
i
tell
you
what
interrupted
bessie
let
us
put
things
into
our
rules
which
will
be
a
for
me
too
for
instance
now
i
am
untidy
well
yes
just
a
little
bit
said
gwin
her
eyes
dancing
it
more
than
a
little
bit
said
bessie
oh
gwin
you
do
know
what
a
nuisance
it
is
to
keep
my
room
in
order
and
sometimes
i
forget
the
things
dear
mother
tells
me
and
i
am
impatient
with
poor
little
judy
who
takes
i
must
say
a
fiendish
delight
in
putting
my
things
in
hiding
now
our
rules
might
include
tidiness
of
person
and
order
generally
it
no
trouble
to
me
to
keep
my
books
in
order
nor
my
mind
in
order
but
i
do
hate
washing
my
hands
before
every
meal
and
brushing
my
hair
and
doing
it
up
in
a
fashionable
roll
at
the
back
of
my
head
oh
my
dear
child
said
elma
do
you
imagine
for
a
moment
that
that
excrescence
at
the
back
of
your
head
is
fashionable
i
never
saw
anything
more
dowdy
dowdy
is
it
said
bessie
i
spent
five
minutes
over
it
this
morning
and
twisted
it
up
three
times
in
order
to
give
it
that
horrid
little
handle
of
a
jug
look
which
you
all
aspire
to
well
well
i
suppose
we
need
add
to
our
rules
that
the
girls
who
belong
to
the
society
are
to
be
fashionable
it
would
be
a
really
good
idea
if
we
did
said
elma
i
can
not
see
why
schoolgirls
should
be
a
lot
of
frumps
our
society
is
to
effect
a
certain
object
which
can
never
be
acquired
unaided
in
a
great
school
like
middleton
we
want
to
be
as
ladylike
as
refined
as
nice
as
if
we
belonged
to
a
very
small
and
select
school
we
get
the
best
teaching
at
middleton
but
i
do
suppose
we
get
the
best
manners
well
let
us
add
all
these
things
to
the
rules
said
gwin
and
let
us
begin
to
put
them
down
at
once
first
as
to
the
name
until
we
can
think
of
a
better
we
must
call
it
the
improvement
society
a
hateful
word
said
bessie
the
yes
it
does
sound
priggish
said
elma
well
i
dare
say
some
one
will
have
genius
enough
to
think
of
a
more
flashy
and
brilliant
name
said
gwin
but
for
the
present
we
will
call
it
the
improvement
for
that
is
exactly
what
it
means
now
then
for
the
rules
as
gwin
spoke
she
drew
in
front
of
her
a
sheet
of
foolscap
paper
and
dipping
her
pen
in
ink
looked
eagerly
at
her
three
young
companions
rule
she
said
for
goodness
sake
cried
bessie
let
rule
apply
to
study
do
let
down
lightly
with
regard
to
tidiness
and
fashionable
hair
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
yes
we
will
begin
about
the
most
important
matters
first
said
gwin
here
she
began
to
write
rapidly
in
pencil
i
must
copy
this
out
in
my
best
and
most
copperplate
hand
presently
she
continued
but
while
we
are
correcting
matters
and
getting
down
our
rules
somehow
pencil
will
do
well
rule
shall
it
be
something
like
this
girls
members
of
this
society
are
expected
to
aim
for
the
top
of
the
class
in
each
branch
of
their
study
at
middleton
school
they
are
expected
to
gain
at
least
one
prize
at
the
midsummer
examination
that
sounds
rather
like
emulation
coming
in
interrupted
bessie
it
must
come
in
bessie
it
must
said
elma
we
must
have
something
to
work
for
i
thought
the
love
of
the
thing
began
poor
bessie
oh
bessie
challoner
do
shut
up
yes
gwin
that
first
rule
goes
very
well
said
elma
we
are
to
aim
for
the
top
of
the
class
and
we
are
to
secure
at
least
one
prize
each
hurrah
for
the
mutual
improvement
society
now
then
let
us
get
to
rule
ii
that
applies
to
deportment
said
gwin
members
of
the
mutual
improvement
society
are
to
aim
at
ladylike
manners
they
are
to
refrain
from
slang
in
conversation
and
they
are
to
refuse
to
make
friends
with
girls
who
indulge
too
largely
in
that
special
form
of
vulgarity
poor
kitty
malone
but
she
does
not
talk
slang
said
bessie
she
talks
ireland
and
ireland
and
england
are
as
far
apart
as
the
poles
rule
continued
gwin
relates
to
tidiness
and
now
bessie
comes
your
tug
of
war
members
of
the
society
must
engage
to
keep
their
home
things
in
perfect
order
as
well
as
their
school
desks
they
must
be
neat
in
their
persons
exquisitely
clean
with
regard
to
hands
and
teeth
and
tidy
with
regard
to
hair
i
do
think
i
join
said
bessie
nonsense
bessie
it
was
you
who
told
us
to
put
all
this
in
i
as
a
matter
of
course
always
do
these
things
said
gwin
looking
very
sweet
and
the
essence
of
young
ladyhood
as
she
spoke
oh
yes
you
dear
old
thing
you
are
perfect
but
you
do
live
in
the
sort
of
ramshackle
house
we
do
said
bessie
however
never
mind
i
am
quite
agreeable
to
go
in
for
the
and
now
is
there
anything
else
oh
yes
there
is
said
elma
and
i
think
it
is
a
most
important
thing
members
of
the
society
as
far
as
they
possibly
can
are
to
adhere
to
fashionable
dress
to
hair
done
in
a
stylish
manner
and
in
short
to
that
distinction
of
appearance
which
ought
to
characterize
the
lady
of
the
present
day
well
done
elma
said
gwin
that
is
a
capital
rule
it
is
a
hateful
rule
said
bessie
i
really
do
think
i
can
join
i
do
know
what
fashionable
clothes
are
i
never
study
the
fashions
i
have
not
the
slightest
idea
whether
sleeves
are
worn
stuck
out
to
the
size
of
a
balloon
or
to
the
arm
all
i
ask
for
in
a
sleeve
is
that
it
should
be
comfortable
all
i
ask
for
in
a
dress
is
that
i
should
not
know
i
have
it
on
i
like
to
be
warm
in
winter
and
cool
in
summer
more
i
do
not
ask
for
then
the
rule
will
do
you
a
wonderful
lot
of
good
said
gwin
and
now
is
it
decided
if
so
we
will
draw
up
the
rules
in
proper
form
and
i
tell
you
what
said
bessie
i
have
thought
of
a
name
and
a
good
one
too
let
us
call
the
society
the
society
well
done
said
gwin
that
will
be
capital
and
now
is
there
to
be
a
subscription
or
is
there
not
oh
certainly
said
alice
it
would
make
it
much
more
distinguished
and
prevent
too
many
girls
asking
to
join
we
want
to
have
the
society
rather
select
do
we
i
suppose
so
said
gwin
but
i
do
think
that
really
depends
upon
the
amount
of
the
subscription
what
do
you
say
to
half
a
guinea
girls
alice
looked
thoughtful
and
elma
face
turned
rather
pale
but
she
was
the
first
to
say
she
thought
gwin
suggestion
an
admirable
one
then
that
is
all
right
said
gwin
and
i
will
set
to
work
to
write
out
the
rules
as
neatly
as
i
can
after
they
are
all
set
out
in
due
form
we
can
see
if
there
are
any
improvements
to
be
suggested
gwin
set
to
work
bending
low
over
her
foolscap
paper
and
alice
offered
to
help
her
elma
and
bessie
wandered
out
of
the
room
and
soon
their
conversation
turned
to
the
subject
of
kitty
bessie
stood
up
warmly
for
the
irish
girl
as
elma
called
her
she
has
a
lot
of
good
in
her
said
bessie
warmly
she
would
be
a
splendid
girl
if
she
were
tamed
down
a
little
i
really
do
think
we
want
to
take
much
of
the
fire
out
of
her
but
if
she
would
only
restrain
some
of
her
wild
speeches
it
would
be
all
the
better
for
if
she
remains
as
frank
as
she
is
at
present
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
she
can
not
help
making
enemies
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question
bessie
said
elma
dropping
her
voice
to
a
low
tone
is
it
true
that
kitty
malone
is
rich
rich
echoed
bessie
i
really
can
not
tell
you
i
thought
you
might
happen
to
know
as
you
have
made
such
chums
with
her
she
is
your
greatest
friend
now
at
middle
ton
school
is
she
not
certainly
not
replied
bessie
what
do
you
mean
by
asking
me
such
a
strange
question
elma
alice

far
and
away
my
greatest
friend
and
after
alice
i
like
gwin
best
oh
everybody
likes
gwin
harley
said
elma
who
could
help
it
she
is
so
beautiful
to
look
at
and
she
has
such
a
delightful
lovely
home
i
can
not
see
that
her
having
a
lovely
delightful
home
has
anything
to
do
with
our
liking
her
said
honest
bessie
not
to
you
perhaps
answered
elma
and
a
queer
look
came
into
her
eyes
i
thought
you
would
be
sure
to
be
able
to
tell
me
if
kitty
were
rich
she
said
again
after
a
pause
i
can
not
you
must
ask
alice
she
lives
with
alice
she
has
plenty
of
pretty
dresses
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
but
i
do
know
anything
about
her
having
money
i
will
run
into
the
house
this
minute
and
ask
alice
said
elma
do
of
course
if
you
are
anxious
but
i
can
not
imagine
what
difference
it
makes
to
you
no
it
does
but
i
am
just
curious
on
the
subject
i
wo
keep
you
long
elma
dashed
into
the
house
she
presently
came
back
i
have
found
out
all
about
it
she
said
all
about
what
asked
bessie
what
i
went
into
the
house
for
how
forgetful
you
are
bessie
i
was
wondering
if
i
might
steal
into
the
library
said
bessie
i
did
not
get
all
the
information
i
wanted
about
magnetic
iron
ore
but
well
what
is
it
elma
kitty
malone
is
rich
very
rich
and
i
ca
see
that
it
matters
said
bessie
i
mean
to
us
oh
but
it
matters
a
good
deal
you
do
understand
i
shall
certainly
vote
that
we
ask
her
to
join
the
society
you
will
cried
bessie
a
look
of
great
pleasure
came
into
her
eyes
then
i
am
really
glad
for
to
join
such
a
society
would
do
kitty
more
good
than
anything
else
in
the
world
only
the
nicest
girls
will
belong
and
she
will
get
at
once
into
the
best
set
she
is
as
wild
as
she
can
be
but
she
has
got
plenty
of
honor
and
if
she
once
gave
her
word
that
she
would
do
a
certain
thing
no
one
would
do
it
better
let
us
have
her
by
all
means
let
us
put
it
to
the
vote
as
soon
as
we
go
back
to
the
house
said
elma
come
bessie
no
slinking
away
in
the
direction
of
that
fascinating
library
they
have
nearly
copied
the
rules
and
we
are
to
read
them
over
and
make
comments
i
think
it
will
be
a
delightful
society
said
bessie
i
am
sure
it
will
do
me
good
it
is
meant
to
do
us
all
good
said
elma
i
should
rather
think
it
will
be
how
i
shall
hate
that
terrible
effort
to
get
to
the
head
of
my
class
not
that
i
am
stupid
or
dislike
my
lessons
that
would
be
the
nice
part
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
said
bessie
but
oh
the
fashionable
sleeves
and
the
stylish
hair
oh
dear
i
often
feel
inclined
to
have
my
hair
cut
short
well
bessie
you
would
be
a
fool
if
you
did
said
elma
your
splendid
hair
why
it
nearly
down
to
your
knees
yes
and
that
the
bother
said
bessie
for
mother
insists
on
my
brushing
it
out
every
night
for
at
least
ten
minutes
and
all
that
time
is
taken
from
my
books
i
tell
you
elma
i
would
gladly
change
with
you
elma
locks
were
very
thin
and
straggly
and
she
could
not
help
coloring
at
this
compliment
but
at
that
moment
alice
appeared
on
the
balcony
to
tell
the
other
two
girls
that
the
rules
were
ready
and
that
they
might
return
to
the
house
they
did
so
and
the
rules
were
then
read
carefully
over
by
elma
on
this
occasion
criticized
by
gwin
alice
and
bessie
and
finally
carried
as
far
as
the
original
members
of
the
society
were
concerned
the
next
important
thing
was
to
put
to
the
vote
who
was
to
be
asked
to
join
and
who
was
to
be
excluded
several
girls
were
named
and
among
them
elma
suddenly
introduced
the
name
of
kitty
malone
now
what
do
you
mean
by
that
said
alice
her
eyes
flashing
angrily
if
kitty
joins
the
society
i
for
one
will
resign
but
you
can
not
dear
said
gwin
in
her
placid
voice
remember
you
are
one
of
the
founders
you
are
bound
to
uphold
the
society
now
for
at
least
one
term
of
its
natural
life
at
the
end
of
that
time
you
are
permitted
to
resign
but
certainly
not
before
then
as
i
presume
i
have
a
vote
with
regard
to
the
election
of
members
i
certainly
do
not
wish
for
kitty
malone
said
alice
i
think
the
votes
must
go
by
the
wishes
of
the
majority
replied
gwin
does
any
one
else
want
her
i
do
said
elma
holding
up
her
hand
and
i
think
it
would
be
good
for
her
said
bessie
dear
me
bessie
how
spiteful
of
you
to
say
that
cried
alice
but
i
do
think
it
alice
i
do
truly
why
bessie
asked
gwin
well
you
know
there
are
the
sort
of
things
mentioned
in
our
rules
which
would
just
give
kitty
the
sort
of
restraint
she
wants
began
bessie
yes
i
think
i
begin
to
understand
you
bessie
i
too
will
vote
that
she
is
asked
to
join
said
gwin
alice
looked
very
sulky
but
did
not
say
anything
further
and
soon
afterward
the
girls
broke
up
their
conference
chapter
vii
elma
kitty
malone
was
admitted
to
a
low
form
at
middleton
school
her
acquirements
being
the
reverse
of
distinguished
this
fact
did
not
give
her
the
smallest
sense
of
discomfort
on
the
contrary
she
was
pleased
and
although
her
were
all
younger
and
smaller
than
herself
she
soon
became
a
sort
of
queen
among
them
laughing
and
joking
with
them
and
flying
round
the
playground
with
half
a
dozen
small
girls
at
her
heels
feasting
them
with
unlimited
chocolate
and
telling
them
stories
she
soon
got
through
her
somewhat
easy
lessons
and
was
wilder
and
more
incorrigible
than
ever
the
only
sober
moments
she
seemed
to
enjoy
were
when
she
was
with
bessie
for
bessie
challoner
took
a
sincere
interest
in
her
and
was
very
anxious
to
get
her
into
a
higher
form
where
she
would
be
with
girls
nearer
her
own
age
and
would
thus
be
forced
to
submit
to
more
discipline
than
she
could
enjoy
with
the
younger
girls
bessie
also
hoped
great
things
from
the
society
and
soon
told
kitty
that
she
was
to
be
asked
to
become
a
member
i
will
certainly
join
when
i
am
asked
answered
kitty
i
have
not
the
least
idea
what
you
are
all
driving
at
but
i
become
a
member
if
to
be
in
the
same
society
with
you
my
darling
duck
of
a
girl
bessie
then
read
her
a
copy
of
the
rules
why
then
you
ca
expect
me
to
adhere
to
the
first
of
them
was
kitty
answer
it
no
it
no
to
that
bessie
i
would
tell
a
lie
for
any
earthly
thing
and
i
could
not
drive
myself
to
the
head
of
that
class
why
i
would
take
the
place
from
sweet
little
agnes
moore
for
all
the
world
why
it
tears
i
bring
to
the
pretty
eyes
of
the
creature
oh
i
could
get
ahead
of
her
i
just
as
lief
be
at
the
tail
just
as
lief
but
kitty
have
you
no
ambition
well
no
dear
i
do
think
i
have
i
never
could
see
the
fun
of
taking
a
prize
from
another
it
no
use
i
be
in
the
society
not
the
least
bit
well
all
the
same
it
would
do
you
good
said
bessie
for
you
know
you
love
your
father
and
you
said
you
would
try
to
acquire
knowledge
to
please
him
oh
where
the
good
of
reminding
me
of
that
said
kitty
looking
very
thoughtful
and
somewhat
pensive
why
did
you
come
out
with
it
bessie
aroon
it
fretting
the
heart
out
of
me
you
are
dear
old
dad
nothing
i
would
do
for
him
i
am
glad
i
did
remind
you
kitty
for
you
know
you
have
come
here
to
learn
ah
dear
i
shut
my
ears
if
you
talk
any
more
in
that
sort
of
way
said
kitty
if
i
must
learn
i
must
but
do
be
reminding
me
of
it
there
a
good
creature
it
play
out
of
school
if
it
work
in
much
work
you
do
kitty
why
i
always
see
you
laughing
and
winking
and
twinkling
your
eyes
and
pushing
your
feet
about
pushing
my
feet
about
and
is
it
to
keep
them
in
a
corner
i
would
pretty
feet
like
mine
why
they
are
meant
to
be
seen
that
the
only
reason
why
i
object
to
a
long
dress
because
it
does
not
show
so
much
of
the
feet
and
ankles
ah
sure
it
dear
little
ankles
i
have
as
neat
and
trim
as
you
please
kitty
you
are
getting
wilder
than
ever
well
darling
i
cool
down
if
you
just
let
me
give
you
one
of
my
big
hugs
i
really
ca
my
ribs
are
quite
sore
you
must
not
do
it
i
told
you
you
might
once
a
week
but
no
oftener
kitty
sank
down
on
the
nearest
chair
and
looked
comically
miserable
go
on
with
the
next
rule
bessie
she
said
after
a
moment
i
want
to
belong
to
the
because
it
close
to
you
i
be
darling
what
the
next
rule
bessie
read
it
out
to
her
why
now
it
the
pink
of
a
lady
i
am
myself
said
kitty
i
was
always
told
i
was
i
do
mind
that
rule
in
the
least
there
wo
be
much
of
a
there
if
kitty
malone
is
to
be
a
lady
why
a
lady
she
is
i
wish
you
could
hear
aunt
honora
and
aunt
bridget
talking
about
our
ancient
family
and
our
long
and
royal
descent
go
on
bessie
not
so
bad
as
taking
the
prize
from
poor
little
agnes
what
rule
rule
iii
was
read
aloud
to
kitty
who
shook
her
head
solemnly
several
times
now
to
be
frank
with
you
she
said
there
only
one
bond
between
alice
and
me
and
that
is
we
do
make
a
froth
of
the
things
in
our
drawers
and
if
we
are
both
to
struggle
against
our
besetting
infirmity
it
will
go
hard
with
us
but
there
it
will
be
fun
to
see
her
struggling
to
be
tidy
and
all
to
no
purpose
i
think
i
join
on
that
account
i
shall
like
to
see
her
fighting
her
drawers
i
know
if
i
put
to
it
i
can
keep
mine
twenty
times
tidier
i
am
now
coming
to
rule
said
bessie
this
she
read
aloud
with
some
qualms
for
she
disliked
it
so
very
much
herself
kitty
eyes
flashed
with
pleasure
now
that
is
after
my
own
heart
she
cried
fashionable
dresses
are
they
and
hair
done
up
in
style
mavourneen
mavourneen
you
will
have
to
wear
a
fringe
kitty
burst
into
peals
of
laughter
oh
bessie
she
said
i
have
just
been
longing
to
attack
that
head
of
yours
i
bring
my
little
tongs
along
and
i
curl
up
such
a
lovely
fringe
on
your
great
intellectual
forehead
you
do
nothing
of
the
kind
said
bessie
clasping
her
hands
over
her
head
to
protect
her
thick
long
hair
but
you
must
mavourneen
you
must
if
you
join
the
society
oh
it
beautiful
you
look
and
i
tell
you
what
it
is
bessie
lend
you
the
patterns
of
my
new
sleeves
those
that
are
all
crinkled
from
above
the
elbow
down
to
the
wrist
and
puffed
ever
so
much
at
the
top
with
little
tucks
and
little
insertions
and
little
kitty
i
wo
listen
to
you
for
another
moment
i
shall
try
to
dress
as
neatly
as
i
can
and
perhaps
i
must
twist
my
hair
into
a
more
stylish
coil
at
the
back
of
my
head
but
beyond
that
i
absolutely
refuse
to
go
well
it
a
delicious
rule
said
kitty
malone
and
i
hope
i
work
you
round
after
a
bit
bessie
it
seems
but
fair
that
if
i
yield
to
you
with
regard
to
the
other
rules
you
ought
to
yield
to
me
about
rule
iv
i
am
sure
if
i
do
take
the
prize
from
poor
little
agnes
moore
and
if
i
never
speak
a
word
of
slang
and
if
i
keep
my
abominable
drawers
as
neat
as
a
new
pin
and
all
my
clothes
in
perfect
order
that
you
on
your
part
ought
to
wear
a
good
thick
heavy
fringe
and
have
your
hair
pointed
out
ever
so
far
at
the
back
in
the
way
it
is
worn
in
the
present
day
love
to
do
it
and
you
have
magnificent
hair
bessie
aroon
so
you
have
i
must
ask
you
to
leave
me
now
kitty
was
bessie
answer
you
are
a
very
funny
girl
and
there
is
a
great
deal
that
i
like
in
you
but
i
can
not
neglect
my
studies
even
for
you
oh
bother
your
studies
answered
kitty
bessie
however
was
quite
in
earnest
and
kitty
had
to
leave
her
the
next
day
there
was
another
meeting
at
gwin
harley
house
and
the
members
of
the
society
were
formally
initiated
into
the
mysteries
of
what
they
had
undertaken
about
ten
girls
joined
in
all
and
it
was
decided
to
limit
the
number
to
these
until
the
end
of
the
present
term
in
addition
to
the
four
chief
rules
it
was
also
clearly
understood
that
the
members
were
all
to
be
absolutely
faithful
the
one
to
the
other
that
no
member
of
the
society
was
to
speak
against
another
member
on
the
contrary
she
was
to
uphold
her
through
thick
and
thin
to
help
her
if
possible
to
aid
her
in
moments
of
difficulty
and
to
rejoice
with
her
in
moments
of
triumph
once
a
week
the
members
were
to
meet
at
each
other
houses
there
they
were
to
have
tea
together
to
discuss
the
rules
if
necessary
but
at
any
rate
to
have
a
pleasant
time
as
the
summer
advanced
picnics
were
to
be
inaugurated
on
saturdays
and
fun
of
some
sort
or
another
was
to
be
the
vogue
kitty
who
had
dressed
herself
for
this
auspicious
occasion
in
a
dress
of
the
palest
blue
with
a
silver
sheen
running
in
zigzag
lines
all
over
it
whose
black
hair
was
curled
up
on
her
forehead
and
coiled
fantastically
round
the
back
of
her
head
whose
eyes
were
shining
and
wreathing
themselves
in
all
sorts
of
smiles
could
scarcely
restrain
her
spirits
while
the
rest
of
the
girls
were
debating
on
the
rules
finally
gwin
laid
a
little
box
on
the
table
and
asked
the
new
members
to
subscribe
their
each
each
girl
dropped
her
and
sixpence
into
the
box
with
the
exception
of
elma
who
coloring
a
little
said
she
would
bring
it
to
gwin
the
next
day
no
one
made
any
remark
as
it
was
well
known
in
the
school
that
elma
was
anything
but
well
off
and
gwin
privately
resolved
to
subscribe
for
her
without
saying
anything
about
it
then
the
girls
had
tea
in
gwin
own
private
and
afterward
they
wandered
about
the
lawns
and
returned
home
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
on
this
occasion
elma
found
herself
side
by
side
with
kitty
malone
kitty
was
walking
quietly
she
had
exhausted
some
of
her
emotions
during
the
hours
that
she
had
played
tennis
and
laughed
and
chatted
with
the
other
members
of
the
society
and
when
elma
put
her
hand
on
her
arm
and
looked
up
at
her
and
kitty
stopped
short
and
said
in
her
hearty
frank
voice
and
what
may
you
be
wanting
with
me
elma
is
it
a
favor
i
can
do
you
because
if
it
is
i
am
sure
you
are
welcome
to
it
with
all
the
pleasure
in
life
you
are
a
girl
kitty
said
elma
i
always
felt
that
from
the
very
first
shall
we
drop
a
little
behind
the
others
the
fact
is
i
do
want
every
one
to
hear
what
i
am
going
to
say
to
you
if
it
is
a
secret
darling
do
tell
it
to
me
said
kitty
for
i
can
not
keep
it
i
always
say
so
quite
frankly
i
say
to
each
person
who
comes
to
me
with
a
private
confidence
nothing
in
kitty
malone
for
kitty
malone
is
a
sieve
oh
but
it
would
never
do
for
you
to
be
that
said
elma
who
was
somewhat
alarmed
and
secretly
greatly
disgusted
a
girl
is
not
worth
her
salt
if
she
tells
what
is
confided
to
her
by
another
girl
and
of
course
now
that
you
have
become
a
member
of
the
society
if
you
are
found
blabbing
any
of
our
secrets
at
middleton
school
i
know
what
will
happen
i
wonder
what
would
happen
cried
kitty
it
would
be
quite
nice
to
find
out
do
tell
me
elma
how
can
i
when
you
do
understand
said
elma
you
would
be
wanting
in
all
honor
none
of
us
ten
girls
would
speak
to
you
again
would
bessie
challoner
the
darling
certainly
not
she
could
not
none
of
us
could
i
should
like
that
said
kitty
thoughtfully
i
did
not
know
when
i
joined
the
that
i
was
to
be
burdened
with
secrets
and
am
i
not
to
explain
to
any
of
the
other
girls
why
i
am
moving
heaven
and
earth
to
get
to
the
very
head
of
the
class
am
i
not
to
breathe
the
real
reason
when
i
am
taking
poor
little
agnes
moore
place
and
breaking
her
heart
the
pretty
lamb
is
that
so
you
certainly
are
not
said
elma
dear
me
kitty
what
a
very
extraordinary
specimen
you
are
well
do
scold
me
for
pity
sake
said
kitty
i
am
so
sick
of
every
one
telling
me
that
i
am
an
extraordinary
specimen
in
ireland
they
think
i
am
a
very
fine
specimen
but
here
oh
it
nothing
but
holding
up
of
hands
and
rolling
up
of
eyes
and
dear
let
us
get
out
of
her
way
and
dear
how
queer
she
looks
in
her
grand
clothes
and
and
do
stop
talking
kitty
you
are
the
most
awful
rattlepate
there
now
on
you
go
said
poor
kitty
i
a
rattlepate
am
i
it
seems
that
i
can
never
speak
but
i
get
into
somebody
black
books
you
do
get
into
mine
i
am
sure
said
elma
but
i
think
you
ought
to
be
greatly
obliged
to
me
for
telling
you
what
is
your
plain
duty
with
regard
to
the
society
it
is
just
like
a
secret
society
our
rules
are
our
own
and
not
a
soul
who
is
not
a
member
must
know
anything
about
them
well
i
wo
tell
said
kitty
when
i
say
a
thing
i
stick
to
it
i
wo
split
there
i
that
flat
and
i
suppose
i
am
obliged
to
you
elma
yon
ought
to
be
answered
elma
why
what
a
terrible
scrape
you
would
have
got
into
and
now
then
kitty
i
have
something
else
to
tell
you
well
and
what
is
it
asked
kitty
first
are
you
not
pleased
that
you
are
a
member
of
the
society
to
be
sure
i
am
i
think
it
is
awfully
nice
of
all
you
girls
to
ask
me
to
join
it
is
a
great
distinction
continued
elma
a
new
girl
like
you
one
who
is
not
known
a
bit
in
the
school
out
of
the
whole
school
we
have
only
selected
ten
including
the
founders
and
you
are
one
you
ought
to
think
yourself
in
rare
luck
so
i
do
and
you
ought
to
be
very
grateful
so
i
am
but
do
you
know
whom
you
ought
to
be
grateful
to
well
i
suppose
to
bessie
not
a
bit
of
it
it
is
to
me
you
ought
to
be
grateful
but
for
me
you
would
not
be
a
member
of
the
society
but
for
you
elma
no
was
it
you
who
got
me
asked
to
join
i
was
the
one
who
insisted
on
your
being
asked
to
join
us
i
put
it
plainly
to
bessie
and
to
gwin
and
they
quite
agreed
with
me
alice
was
the
only
one
who
voted
against
you
oh
just
like
her
spiteful
thing
said
kitty
coloring
with
annoyance
well
i
am
sure
elma
i
am
obliged
to
you
and
if
anything
i
can
do
i
am
coming
to
that
said
elma
it
not
much
but
if
you
could
could
what
why
i
do
anything
is
it
one
of
my
gowns
you
want
to
borrow
no
no
what
extraordinary
ideas
you
hare
oh
there
you
begin
again
said
kitty
i
never
can
speak
right
well
what
can
i
do
for
you
elma
if
you
could
just
until
next
monday
if
you
could
lend
me
some
some
money
said
elma
coloring
as
she
spoke
her
voice
faltering
and
her
eyes
seeking
the
ground
chapter
viii
the
little
house
in
constantine
road
kitty
stared
at
her
companion
for
a
moment
then
she
put
her
hand
into
her
pocket
and
took
out
a
very
fat
sealskin
purse
she
opened
it
and
held
it
out
to
elma
help
yourself
she
said
elma
looked
into
the
purse
golden
sovereigns
lay
there
in
delicious
rows
there
must
have
been
at
least
fifteen
sovereigns
in
the
purse
take
as
many
as
you
like
said
kitty
you
are
heartily
welcome
you
do
mean
it
you
ca
replied
elma
turning
very
pale
why
what
are
you
hesitating
about
you
said
you
wanted
some
money
dear
heart
alive
everybody
wants
money
in
ireland
we
are
always
borrowing
one
from
the
other
take
as
many
of
those
yellow
boys
as
you
fancy
and
say
no
more
about
it
i
am
obliged
to
you
kitty
said
elma
i
think
you
are
quite
splendid
but
can
i
do
you
really
mean
it
can
i
take
five
five
bless
you
take
them
all
if
you
want
them
i
have
only
to
write
to
the
dear
old
man
at
home
and
ask
him
to
send
me
a
fiver
or
a
tenner
and
he
do
it
you
need
have
no
qualms
and
but
when
must
i
give
them
back
whenever
you
like
you
do
really
require
them
on
monday
do
you
i
do
require
them
at
any
special
date
pay
me
when
it
is
convenient
here
you
may
as
well
have
ten
i
could
not
it
is
too
much
said
elma
she
put
her
hands
behind
her
back
her
teeth
were
chattering
and
she
was
trembling
all
over
she
was
afraid
that
kitty
must
read
her
through
and
through
oh
what
is
the
use
of
bothering
cried
kitty
malone
if
you
take
ten
take
eight
let
me
see
that
leaves
me
seven
over
seven
sovereigns
i
do
ever
want
to
spend
any
money
here
of
course
i
may
require
a
new
dress
when
the
fashions
change
i
must
keep
strictly
up
to
date
now
that
i
have
joined
the
but
in
case
i
do
i
just
send
a
wire
to
aunt
bridget
in
dublin
and
she
send
me
over
a
beauty
ah
she
a
dear
old
soul
aunt
bridget
is
there
elma
do
take
the
money
and
be
quick
about
it
elma
feeling
sick
and
low
hating
herself
as
she
had
never
hated
herself
before
dipped
her
greedy
fingers
into
kitty
sealskin
purse
and
soon
extracted
eight
of
the
golden
sovereigns
these
she
slipped
into
her
pocket
i
can
not
tell
you
how
grateful
i
am
to
you
she
said
not
another
word
cried
kitty
i
have
forgotten
all
about
it
already
now
shall
we
have
a
run
i
want
to
catch
up
to
bessie
i
have
not
had
a
word
with
her
for
the
whole
of
the
day
elma
no
longer
required
to
keep
kitty
malone
in
the
background
she
had
now
gained
her
object
hoping
against
hope
to
extract
from
half
a
sovereign
to
fifteen
shillings
from
the
irish
girl
she
suddenly
found
herself
the
lucky
possessor
of
eight
whole
sovereigns
never
in
the
whole
course
of
her
life
had
elma
possessed
anything
approaching
such
a
sum
her
mother
was
very
poor
she
had
only
one
sister
a
daily
governess
all
elma
people
were
hard
up
as
the
expression
goes
and
elma
herself
only
attended
middleton
school
because
an
aunt
paid
her
school
fees
hardly
ever
could
the
girl
secure
even
half
a
crown
for
her
own
pleasure
she
hated
poverty
she
detested
the
small
privations
which
slender
means
involved
she
was
in
no
sense
of
the
word
a
high
refined
character
on
the
contrary
there
was
something
small
in
her
nature
something
little
about
her
she
had
ever
cringed
to
the
wealthy
she
had
made
friends
with
gwin
harley
who
was
rich
and
generous
but
also
very
conscientious
and
with
abundance
of
common
sense
a
glance
had
told
elma
that
she
could
never
ask
gwin
to
lend
her
money
but
kitty
innocent
frank
generous
kitty
had
proved
an
all
too
easy
prey
at
that
moment
elma
despised
kitty
as
much
as
she
was
grateful
to
her
the
eight
pounds
which
she
might
return
whenever
she
liked
lay
lightly
in
her
pocket
she
almost
danced
in
her
excitement
and
sense
of
triumph
of
course
kitty
would
never
tell
that
went
without
saying
and
in
the
meantime
she
was
rich
beyond
her
wildest
dreams
the
girls
had
joined
forces
when
they
came
up
to
the
stream
which
led
across
a
wide
field
called
the
willow
meadow
kitty
linked
her
hand
inside
bessie
arm
and
elma
and
alice
walked
side
by
side
well
exclaimed
alice
how
did
you
get
on
with
her
elma
with
whom
asked
elma
oh
need
you
ask
that
detestable
kitty
malone
i
saw
you
sucking
up
to
her
and
wondered
why
i
wish
you
would
not
use
such
horrid
vulgar
words
alice
said
elma
you
know
you
are
really
breaking
the
rules
of
the
we
are
requested
not
to
make
use
of
slang
i
forgot
said
alice
but
if
it
comes
to
that
she
continued
i
believe
i
shall
have
to
leave
the
society
if
i
can
never
express
my
feelings
with
regard
to
kitty
malone
but
do
you
really
dislike
her
as
much
as
ever
asked
elma
who
shabby
and
mean
as
she
was
in
her
poor
little
soul
could
scarcely
bring
herself
to
run
down
generous
kitty
just
then
dislike
her
cried
alice
i
hate
her
there
i
suppose
that
flat
and
plain
enough
it
certainly
is
but
you
do
mean
to
say
it
is
impossible
elma
that
you
see
anything
to
like
in
her
well
of
course
answered
elma
who
wished
to
propitiate
alice
for
her
nature
was
to
be
all
things
to
all
men
i
can
see
at
a
glance
that
she
is
not
your
style
she
has
not
got
your
cleverness
and
refinement
dear
alice
oh
bother
cried
alice
but
all
the
same
she
was
pleased
and
when
elma
tucked
her
small
hand
inside
of
her
arm
alice
did
not
shake
her
off
any
one
can
see
that
continued
elma
lewis
but
i
do
think
she
is
quite
so
bad
as
you
paint
her
alice
alice
private
opinion
of
elma
was
that
she
was
a
little
toad
and
she
now
managed
to
extricate
herself
from
the
smaller
girl
clasp
i
shall
never
like
her
she
said
there
is
no
good
in
your
praising
her
to
me
if
you
mean
to
be
her
friend
you
must
do
so
from
a
double
motive
how
uncharitable
of
you
cried
elma
coloring
crimson
as
she
spoke
oh
i
can
guess
it
very
well
my
dear
pursued
alice
but
for
you
she
would
not
be
a
member
of
the
what
would
have
been
a
delightful
society
a
pleasure
to
the
best
girls
at
middleton
school
will
be
nothing
whatever
but
a
ridiculous
farce
a
scene
of
high
comedy
something
contemptible
now
that
kitty
malone
has
joined
it
but
for
you
she
would
never
have
been
asked
to
join
why
did
you
do
it
elma
for
no
reason
in
particular
answered
elma
that
is
certainly
not
true
and
you
know
it
i
can
not
think
why
you
speak
to
me
in
that
tone
said
elma
what
have
i
done
to
you
that
you
should
think
so
badly
of
me
oh
i
do
think
badly
of
you
elma
not
specially
but
i
have
always
seen
that
whatever
you
did
you
did
with
a
reason
in
your
own
way
you
are
clever
you
are
extremely
worldly
wise
there
are
certain
people
who
would
commend
you
but
you
are
not
like
the
rest
of
us
you
are
not
like
gwin
for
instance
nor
like
bessie
nor
like
me
yes
i
will
frankly
say
so
i
am
better
than
you
elma
i
have
not
got
your
double
motives
for
everything
you
are
only
a
girl
now
i
do
know
what
you
will
be
when
you
are
a
woman
the
thought
of
the
eight
sovereigns
so
comfortably
reposing
in
her
pocket
made
elma
able
to
bear
this
very
direct
attack
she
determined
to
take
it
there
was
no
use
whatever
in
quarreling
with
alice
accordingly
she
said
cheerfully
you
may
think
what
you
like
of
me
ally
but
i
hope
in
the
course
of
years
that
you
will
find
i
am
not
so
bad
as
you
paint
me
shortly
afterward
the
girls
parted
and
each
went
on
her
way
to
her
special
home
bessie
ran
briskly
up
the
short
avenue
which
led
to
her
house
waving
farewells
to
her
companions
as
she
did
so
alice
and
kitty
were
obliged
to
content
themselves
one
with
the
other
and
elma
in
the
highest
her
heart
bubbling
over
with
bliss
departed
in
the
direction
of
her
own
humbler
residence
she
had
to
walk
quite
a
mile
and
a
half
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
she
found
herself
in
a
much
poorer
part
of
the
large
suburb
where
middleton
school
was
situated
the
houses
here
were
of
a
humble
description
not
even
semidetached
but
standing
in
long
dismal
rows
a
good
many
of
them
backing
on
to
a
these
houses
boasted
of
no
small
gardens
but
ran
flush
with
the
road
they
were
built
of
the
universal
yellow
brick
and
were
about
as
ugly
as
they
could
well
be
elma
paused
at
no
constantine
road
as
she
did
so
a
high
rasping
and
fretful
voice
screamed
to
her
from
an
upper
window
you
are
later
than
ever
elma
and
mother
has
been
fretting
herself
into
hysterics
do
come
in
at
once
and
be
quick
about
it
elma
mounted
the
two
or
three
steps
which
led
to
the
hall
door
and
pulled
the
bell
with
considerably
more
energy
than
was
her
wont
the
sovereigns
were
in
her
pocket
they
made
all
the
difference
to
her
between
misery
and
happiness
she
entered
the
house
in
high
what
is
it
carrie
she
called
to
the
fretful
voice
which
was
now
approaching
nearer
the
next
moment
a
girl
appeared
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
it
very
easy
for
you
to
ask
what
is
it
cried
its
owner
speaking
in
high
dudgeon
you
promised
to
be
in
between
five
and
six
and
it
is
now
between
seven
and
eight
here
is
all
my
chance
of
an
evening
fun
knocked
on
the
head
it
just
like
you
elma
that
it
is
oh
never
mind
now
please
do
scold
me
said
elma
what
is
it
about
mother
has
she
been
bad
again
oh
it
the
usual
thing
she
has
had
one
of
those
dismal
letters
from
father
i
ca
imagine
why
she
thinks
anything
about
them
it
came
just
when
we
were
all
sitting
down
to
dinner
and
she
began
to
cry
in
that
feeble
sort
of
fashion
oh
do
carrie
she
will
hear
you
said
elma
pray
go
back
to
your
room
and
i
be
with
you
in
a
minute
i
have
something
to
tell
you
you
wo
be
quite
so
miserable
when
you
hear
my
news
carrie
stared
at
elma
and
then
slowly
backed
until
she
reached
a
very
minute
bedroom
which
she
and
elma
shared
together
elma
ran
briskly
upstairs
turning
to
her
right
she
knocked
at
a
certain
door
waited
for
an
answer
but
none
came
then
turned
the
handle
and
went
in
the
venetian
blinds
were
down
here
and
the
form
of
a
woman
was
seen
lying
in
the
center
of
a
big
bed
is
that
you
elma
said
a
voice
and
then
the
head
was
buried
once
more
in
the
pillows
and
no
further
notice
whatever
was
taken
yes
mother
i
am
here
answered
elma
i
was
thinking
you
might
like
something
nice
for
your
supper
a
crab
or
a
lobster
or
something
of
that
sort
which
would
be
your
preference
mother
a
crab
or
a
lobster
muttered
lewis
you
might
as
well
ask
me
if
i
should
like
a
bottle
of
champagne
or
some
caviare
one
is
about
as
likely
to
be
forthcoming
as
the
other
i
tell
you
you
may
choose
said
elma
i
have
my
hat
still
on
and
i
go
as
far
as
the
fishmonger
and
bring
in
either
a
lobster
or
a
crab
lewis
raised
herself
on
her
elbow
as
elma
spoke
what
are
you
dreaming
about
she
said
where
have
you
got
the
money
never
mind
i
have
got
the
money
which
would
be
your
preference
oh
crab
dear
crab
i
like
it
when
it
well
dressed
but
then
maggie
never
can
do
anything
properly
i
dress
it
on
this
occasion
said
elma
you
shall
have
a
good
supper
crab
and
salad
and
there
mother
do
keep
up
heart
again
you
give
way
too
much
ah
child
said
poor
lewis
i
have
had
another
terrible
letter
he
says
he
is
starving
he
can
not
get
work
i
made
the
greatest
possible
mistake
in
allowing
him
to
leave
the
country
you
could
do
nothing
else
said
elma
with
a
little
stamp
of
her
foot
you
know
he
would
not
help
you
in
any
way
he
had
to
leave
but
there
mother
you
shall
tell
me
the
dismal
news
after
tea
you
will
feel
ever
so
much
better
when
you
have
partaken
of
the
dainty
meal
i
mean
to
get
for
you
lewis
did
not
say
anything
further
elma
bent
down
touched
her
parent
on
her
brow
with
the
lightest
possible
caress
and
then
stepped
on
tiptoe
out
of
the
room
poor
mother
she
muttered
it
is
surprising
the
kind
of
things
that
comfort
one
she
is
soothed
at
the
thought
of
crab
for
supper
with
salad
well
that
is
all
right
she
will
be
as
amiable
and
petting
to
me
as
possible
for
the
rest
of
the
day
now
then
for
carrie
a
loose
untidy
badly
hung
together
girl
like
carrie
is
a
trial
to
any
sister
however
i
know
the
sort
of
thing
that
pleases
her
i
must
be
very
careful
of
my
i
shall
not
spend
it
lightly
but
in
giving
my
family
small
unexpected
surprises
it
will
be
doing
me
an
immensely
good
turn
elma
now
entered
the
room
where
carrie
was
fuming
up
and
down
well
what
have
you
to
say
for
yourself
miss
she
cried
when
her
younger
sister
put
in
an
appearance
only
that
i
am
very
sorry
carrie
but
to
be
honest
with
you
i
quite
forgot
that
you
wanted
to
go
out
this
afternoon
did
i
not
tell
you
that
i
was
engaged
to
tea
at
gwin
harley
you
are
forever
with
that
odious
girl
said
carrie
gwin
harley
an
odious
girl
what
in
the
world
do
you
mean
what
i
say
oh
of
course
i
have
seen
her
and
i
know
she
pretty
or
some
people
would
think
her
so
in
my
opinion
she
vastly
too
stuck
up
and
so
sam
raynes
says
sam
saw
her
last
sunday
in
church
and
he
said
she
was
a
bit
his
style
oh
pray
do
quote
sam
raynes
to
me
said
elma
well
carrie
of
course
i
had
tea
with
gwin
and
of
course
she
about
the
nicest
girl
in
the
world
and
kitty
malone
was
there
that
scamp
of
an
irish
girl
oh
she
not
so
bad
when
you
get
to
know
her
better
and
alice
denvers
was
there
and
bessie
challoner
we
had
quite
a
nice
time
of
course
i
told
you
about
that
society
that
i
have
joined
well
there
are
about
ten
girls
members
now
quite
the
elite
of
the
school
i
believe
we
shall
do
a
vast
lot
of
good
what
does
it
matter
to
me
said
carrie
stamping
her
foot
i
have
lost
my
pleasant
afternoon
with
sam
he
and
his
sister
promised
to
meet
me
i
was
to
go
with
them
to
the
crystal
palace
oh
it
too
provoking
carrie
still
fumed
up
and
down
the
room
and
i
have
such
a
dull
time
she
continued
those
children
are
quite
past
bearing
they
wear
the
very
life
out
of
me
see
what
that
little
imp
of
a
claude
did
to
my
dress
this
afternoon
as
carrie
spoke
she
held
up
a
decidedly
shabby
dress
which
bore
a
huge
rent
at
one
side
he
caught
it
in
his
nasty
little
boot
said
the
girl
he
was
scrambling
up
on
my
knee
and
made
such
a
fuss
and
there
happened
to
be
a
tiny
hole
and
then
he
wriggled
and
wriggled
and
made
it
worse
and
worse
the
skirt
is
not
fit
to
wear
i
do
know
what
i
shall
do
i
really
have
not
a
blessed
farthing
to
buy
myself
another
new
thing
elma
made
a
careful
calculation
how
much
was
that
stuff
a
yard
she
asked
suddenly
what
does
it
matter
elma
it
worn
out
now
and
there
an
end
of
it
you
can
not
buy
me
another
gown
so
where
the
good
of
talking
but
perhaps
i
can
said
elma
dubiously
my
dear
elma
what
do
you
mean
well
i
am
not
quite
certain
of
course
said
elma
and
it
would
have
to
be
very
cheap
very
cheap
indeed
but
what
color
would
you
like
carrie
oh
blue
said
carrie
rather
light
in
shade
i
love
blue
and
sam
says
i
look
sweet
in
it
if
you
begin
to
quote
sam
again
i
do
think
i
give
you
sixpence
for
anything
you
know
perfectly
well
that
i
loathe
and
detest
him
oh
that
your
way
said
carrie
you
think
it
is
very
fine
to
detest
all
the
young
men
in
our
set
but
i
tell
you
sam
is
a
right
good
fellow
and
he
has
his
ideas
as
much
as
anybody
he
is
going
to
get
a
raise
too
at
christmas
and
are
you
engaged
to
him
carrie
asked
elma
suddenly
not
yet
oh
we
do
think
of
any
such
thing
but
i
like
to
go
with
him
he
is
great
fun
and
so
is
florrie
florrie
does
mind
a
bit
how
often
she
acts
gooseberry
elma
went
and
stood
by
the
window
she
looked
gloomily
out
how
shabby
and
sordid
her
home
was
how
miserable
everything
seemed
carrie
was
really
a
trial
to
any
sister
elma
wondered
if
in
the
future
she
would
have
to
tolerate
sam
raynes
as
her
a
sick
feeling
crept
over
her
she
was
not
a
particularly
refined
girl
but
in
her
school
life
she
associated
with
girls
of
a
totally
different
caliber
from
poor
carrie
and
a
shudder
ran
through
her
frame
as
she
thought
over
her
sister
if
you
mean
anything
by
that
talk
about
a
new
frock
you
had
better
speak
out
plainly
said
carrie
if
you
can
really
give
me
money
to
get
the
stuff
something
pretty
and
cheap
i
could
buy
it
there
is
still
plenty
of
time
put
on
your
hat
and
we
go
out
at
once
said
elma
carrie
rushed
to
her
wardrobe
took
down
her
frowzy
hat
stuck
it
on
her
towzled
head
drew
a
pair
of
gloves
up
her
arms
and
announced
herself
ready
the
two
girls
ran
briskly
downstairs
lewis
called
from
her
bedroom
after
them
where
are
you
two
going
she
said
am
i
to
be
left
alone
in
the
house
no
maggie
is
in
the
kitchen
called
out
carrie
oh
i
am
sick
of
being
by
myself
and
i
want
my
supper
i
must
go
out
to
choose
the
crab
mother
said
elma
oh
the
crab
replied
lewis
in
a
mollified
tone
if
you
are
going
really
to
get
one
elma
be
sure
you
see
that
it
has
plenty
of
coral
in
it
and
choose
nice
crisp
lettuce
i
care
nothing
for
crab
without
lettuce
all
right
mother
i
manage
said
elma
the
girls
found
themselves
in
the
street
so
you
are
going
to
get
mother
crab
and
lettuce
for
supper
cried
carrie
then
i
suppose
after
all
you
do
mean
to
give
me
money
to
buy
stuff
for
a
new
dress
yes
i
do
carrie
if
you
only
have
patience
i
said
i
would
and
there
an
end
of
it
but
how
have
you
got
the
money
never
you
mind
i
have
got
it
carrie
walked
on
her
spirits
rose
and
she
began
to
talk
in
her
high
staccato
voice
allowing
each
person
who
passed
to
hear
what
she
was
saying
this
is
thursday
she
said
i
shall
get
up
at
daylight
morning
and
i
shall
cut
out
the
dress
and
put
it
in
hand
i
am
always

between
four
and
five
in
the
afternoon
so
i

and
sam

i

have
a
jolly
time
together
in
the
park
on
sunday

said
elma
and
then
we
can
call
at
macpherson
on
our
way
home
they
have
sweet
things
at
macpherson
said
carrie
you
really
are
a
very
old
thing
elma
i
am
glad
you
think
so
said
elma
her
lips
parted
in
a
slightly
satirical
smile
carrie
now
beaming
all
over
with
assisted
in
the
choosing
of
the
crab
she
further
volunteered
to
carry
this
luxury
home
and
suggested
that
radishes
would
be
a
great
addition
to
the
lettuce
is
there
anything
else
you
think
mother
would
like
asked
elma
oh
a
bottle
of
really
good
guinness
stout
said
carrie
capital
carrie
why
you
are
getting
quite
a
head
for
housekeeping
we
give
mother
such
a
good
supper
and
it
will
do
her
a
world
of
good
poor
old
dear
so
it
will
said
jubilant
carrie
having
purchased
the
materials
for
an
appetizing
meal
the
girls
now
entered
a
large
establishment
which
being
supported
by
people
of
extremely
slender
means
could
only
afford
to
indulge
in
the
cheapest
articles
carrie
desired
the
shopman
to
exhibit
cheap
materials
in
different
shades
of
blue
she
finally
selected
one
turquoise
in
color
and
wonderfully
pretty
which
cost
the
large
sum
of
sevenpence
per
yard
she
ordered
the
required
length
to
be
cut
and
elma
took
out
her
purse
to
pay
for
it
she
did
not
at
all
want
her
sister
to
see
how
many
sovereigns
that
purse
contained
and
turned
her
back
slightly
as
she
laid
one
on
the
counter
well
how
you
got
it
baffles
me
cried
carrie
pray
do
speak
so
loud
said
elma
they
really
will
think
that
i
stole
it
if
you
go
on
giving
me
those
sort
of
staccato
rises
of
your
eyebrows
it
all
the
better
for
you
that
sovereign
has
got
you
a
new
dress
so
it
has
and
you
are
an
old
darling
said
carrie
i
tell
sam
all
about
you
on
sunday
elma
by
the
way
what
a
good
idea
you
like
to
come
with
us
there
sam
cousin
maurice
a
capital
fellow
maurice
jones
oh
no
do
speak
of
him
said
elma
she
gave
a
shudder
and
turned
her
head
aside
the
materials
for
the
dress
were
purchased
even
down
to
the
linings
and
buttons
and
carrie
holding
her
parcel
tucked
comfortably
under
her
arm
started
home
elma
accompanying
her
carrie
was
so
excited
and
delighted
with
her
dress
that
she
had
no
time
even
to
think
of
the
wonderful
problem
as
to
how
elma
had
got
the
money
when
they
reached
the
house
elma
ran
into
the
kitchen
and
prepared
to
dress
the
crab
she
did
so
well
and
when
the
dainty
little
meal
was
upon
the
table
ran
upstairs
to
bring
her
mother
down
now
mother
get
up
at
once
she
said
get
up
oh
i
ca
said
lewis
i
have
got
such
a
splitting
headache
but
the
crab
is
downstairs
and
i
have
dressed
it
myself
just
in
the
way
you
like
best
i
have
brought
in
a
little
cayenne
pepper
too
for
i
know
you
do
care
for
crab
without
it
and
the
lettuce
is
wonderfully
crisp
and
fresh
and
there
are
some
radishes
oh
and
carrie
reminded
me
that
you
would
not
care
for
crab
without
your
stout
i
know
said
lewis
in
a
plaintive
voice
your
father
would
never
allow
me
to
touch
crab
or
lobster
without
stout
ah
but
those
good
old
days
are
gone
not
quite
mother
for
there
is
a
bottle
of
guinness
waiting
at
your
disposal
oh
is
there
said
lewis
she
raised
herself
on
her
elbow
then
i
think
i
go
down
she
said
well
make
yourself
smart
mother
i
shall
be
waiting
for
you
and
so
will
carrie
chapter
ix
the
and
the
middleton
school
which
consisted
of
from
six
to
seven
hundred
girls
was
kept
in
a
state
of
discipline
not
so
much
by
punishments
as
by
a
very
strict
code
of
honor
there
were
certain
things
which
no
middleton
girl
who
respected
herself
would
ever
dream
of
doing
there
were
other
things
which
she
would
do
as
a
matter
of
course
for
instance
she
would
uphold
her
school
through
thick
and
thin
allowing
no
outsider
to
run
it
down
to
be
a
member
of
middleton
school
insured
her
friendship
with
all
the
other
girls
in
the
school
the
de
of
this
celebrated
day
school
was
exceptionally
strong
even
in
its
members
met
as
friends
never
forgetting
that
they
were
at
one
time
schoolfellows
in
one
of
the
best
and
most
thorough
colleges
of
learning
in
the
whole
of
england
as
the
fees
for
instruction
were
necessarily
low
and
as
the
school
was
therefore
open
to
all
classes
of
girls
from
the
very
rich
to
those
who
had
but
limited
means
a
rule
and
a
very
strong
one
was
that
all
money
and
class
distinctions
were
to
be
absolutely
abolished
the
girls
so
long
as
they
belonged
to
the
school
were
absolutely
on
the
same
footing
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
their
might
be
very
far
removed
the
one
from
the
other
among
the
most
emphatic
rules
of
the
school
a
rule
which
if
it
were
disobeyed
would
cause
ostracism
on
the
part
of
the
girls
and
the
gravest
reprimand
not
to
say
a
chance
of
expulsion
on
the
part
of
the
teachers
was
the
borrowing
of
money
money
was
supposed
not
to
be
mentioned
between
the
girls
and
as
to
a
poor
girl
borrowing
from
a
rich
it
was
considered
about
the
blackest
crime
which
could
take
place
in
middleton
school
now
elma
knew
this
fact
perfectly
well
and
when
she
took
the
eight
pounds
from
kitty
malone
she
was
aware
of
the
grave
risk
which
she
ran
more
depended
on
her
keeping
up
a
good
character
in
the
school
than
her
companions
were
at
all
aware
of
she
was
sent
to
middleton
school
by
an
aunt
who
to
a
certain
extent
had
adopted
her
her
mother
could
not
possibly
afford
to
pay
the
fees
small
as
they
were
elma
knew
well
as
she
lay
down
to
sleep
that
night
that
if
the
little
transaction
between
herself
and
kitty
were
known
she
would
be
practically
ruined
for
life
no
other
girl
belonging
to
the
school
would
lend
money
even
if
it
were
asked
for
so
strong
was
the
feeling
on
this
head
but
kitty
knew
nothing
about
it
she
had
not
been
long
at
middleton
and
the
subject
had
not
been
mentioned
to
her
elma
sincerely
trusted
to
kitty
never
alluding
to
it
kitty
had
promised
not
to
tell
and
elma
believed
wild
and
erratic
as
she
was
that
when
her
word
was
once
given
she
would
respect
it
when
she
had
asked
kitty
to
lend
her
money
she
had
intended
only
to
take
half
a
sovereign
she
wanted
this
in
order
to
pay
her
subscription
to
the
society
but
when
kitty
generously
opened
her
purse
and
told
her
to
help
herself
the
temptation
had
proved
far
too
strong
before
she
quite
knew
what
she
was
doing
she
had
taken
eight
sovereigns
had
put
herself
absolutely
into
power
and
had
run
the
chance
of
being
ruined
for
life
still
that
first
night
she
slept
soundly
and
awoke
in
the
morning
with
a
sense
of
bliss
she
had
still
a
little
over
seven
sovereigns
not
her
own
and
yet
in
one
sense
quite
her
own
for
kitty
had
said
there
was
no
hurry
about
the
replacing
of
the
money
oh
yes
she
was
quite
certain
that
no
one
would
find
out
she
opened
her
sleepy
eyes
yawned
and
saw
carrie
sitting
at
the
window
busily
employed
cutting
out
her
dress
elma
remarked
crossly
at
the
blaze
of
light
oh
do
say
you
mind
it
you
old
dear
cried
carrie
i
ca
see
unless
i
have
plenty
of
light
and
it
most
important
how
i
cut
this
sleeve
i
mean
it
to
be
puffy
and
yet
not
too
puffy
and
the
elbows
must
fit
exactly
in
the
right
place
what
a
pity
it
is
elma
that
you
and
i
are
not
the
same
sort
of
figure
i
am
nearly
double
as
big
as
you
it
would
be
so
convenient
if
you
could
be
my
model
then
i
might
fit
my
things
like
a
glove
ah
well
i
suppose
there
nothing
perfect
in
the
world
elma
turned
on
her
other
side
if
you
talk
to
me
any
more
she
said
i
shall
become
so
cross
as
to
be
unbearable
go
on
with
your
dress
if
you
must
but
do
speak
elma
returned
to
the
land
of
dreams
and
carrie
cut
and
snipped
and
basted
and
pinned
until
it
was
time
for
her
to
go
downstairs
to
breakfast
elma
got
up
at
her
usual
hour
ate
her
breakfast
with
scarcely
a
remark
and
started
for
school
when
she
got
there
the
different
members
of
the
society
were
hanging
about
the
doors
the
school
was
not
yet
opened
and
the
girls
who
belonged
to
the
society
nodded
to
one
another
and
whispered
and
smiled
among
the
party
waiting
at
the
door
were
alice
denvers
kitty
malone
and
bessie
challoner
gwin
harley
had
not
yet
arrived
it
was
never
gwin
stately
way
to
be
either
too
early
or
too
late
for
school
she
generally
appeared
on
the
scene
driving
up
in
her
pretty
little
phaeton
just
as
the
clock
struck
nine
the
other
girls
always
made
way
for
this
dainty
little
turnout
and
gwin
would
spring
carelessly
to
the
ground
give
a
direction
to
the
smart
tiger
who
sat
behind
and
who
immediately
took
the
reins
and
then
turning
with
a
gay
nod
to
her
companions
would
enter
the
school
with
them
gwin
was
certainly
the
pride
of
the
school
the
girls
who
were
not
her
absolute
friends
looked
at
her
with
awe
wonder
and
admiration
the
girls
who
were
her
friends
bragged
of
the
fact
to
their
companions
it
was
a
pleasure
even
to
look
at
gwin
for
although
she
never
overdressed
herself
she
was
always
so
wonderfully
dainty
her
neat
little
shoes
her
lovely
stockings
the
fine
quality
of
her
cambric
handkerchiefs
the
delicate
scent
which
clung
to
them
the
glossy
braids
of
her
ever
exquisitely
arranged
hair
and
the
very
set
of
that
perfectly
plain
sailor
hat
with
its
band
of
white
ribbon
were
all
the
acme
of
perfection
oh
they
all
betokened
wealth
and
taste
taste
and
wealth
no
wonder
the
girls
worshiped
gwin
she
never
boasted
of
her
wealth
she
never
brought
it
prominently
forward
but
for
all
that
it
pervaded
her
from
the
top
of
her
head
to
the
point
of
her
pretty
bronze
shoes
kitty
now
gave
gwin
an
earnest
and
longing
look
there
was
a
peculiar
expression
about
kitty
face
a
sort
of
new
thoughtful
look
as
though
something
was
worrying
her
and
causing
her
to
cudgel
her
brains
to
quite
a
remarkable
extent
kitty
malone
had
never
yet
been
affected
with
shyness
nor
was
she
shy
now
just
as
gwin
carriage
appeared
and
the
other
girls
made
way
for
it
as
was
their
wont
and
elma
approached
quite
close
to
alice
meaning
to
make
some
remark
to
her
what
she
never
afterward
remembered
kitty
ran
straight
up
to
gwin
and
clasped
her
by
the
hand
i
want
to
say
something
to
you
very
badly
she
began
how
do
you
do
kitty
answered
gwin
in
her
pleasant
voice
you
want
to
say
something
to
me
but
the
bell
has
just
rung
we
must
go
into
school
i
mean
after
school
continued
kitty
can
i
walk
with
you
during
recess
oh
but
please
gwin
cried
elma
at
that
point
you
promised
to
walk
with
me
do
you
remember
yes
and
you
promised
to
walk
with
me
miss
harley
exclaimed
a
girl
of
the
name
of
marcia
tyndal
but
it
is
so
important
gwin
pleaded
kitty
bringing
that
peculiar
irish
quality
into
her
voice
which
it
was
difficult
to
resist
ah
now
do
gwin
she
continued
do
let
me
walk
with
you
just
during
this
recess
the
others
may
have
you
for
every
other
recess
until
christmas
but
do
let
me
be
with
you
just
for
i
think

kitty
said
gwin
elma
you
wo
mind
will
you
marcia
you
and
i
can
have
instead
of
is
it
a
bargain
oh
i
do
mind
said
marcia
tyndal
in
a
good
natured
voice
shrugging
her
fat
shoulders
as
she
spoke
then
the
girls
trooped
into
school
prayers
began
and
immediately
afterward
they
all
assembled
at
their
different
classes
kitty
was
restless
and
nervous
she
could
not
settle
to
her
work
she
was
more
and
inattentive
even
than
usual
the
younger
girls
who
delighted
in
her
and
quite
prided
themselves
on
having
her
in
their
class
nudged
her
in
vain
kitty
whispered
one
little
girl
quite
three
years
kitty
junior
if
you
do
open
your
history
book
you
wo
have
your
lesson
ready
when
miss
worrick
comes
oh

cried
kitty
in
a
low
voice
bother
me
annie
asthore

teased

something
in
the
back
of
my
head
something

back
of

head
whispered
annie
yes

but
hush
alanna
i
ca

bothering
me
entirely
there
if

stupid
history

what

we
doing
mary
davies
oh
it
about
charles
the
first
poor
martyr
shame
to
england
to
cut
off
his
head
kitty
bent
over
her
book
but
soon
her
erratic
fancy
had
started
off
in
another
direction
she
was
sent
to
the
bottom
of
the
class
when
the
history
lesson
came
on
and
was
looked
at
with
growing
disfavor
by
miss
worrick
a
particularly
painstaking
and
earnest
young
teacher
really
miss
malone
if
this
sort
of
thing
goes
on
i
must
report
you
she
said
it
is
pure
inattention
if
you
wish
to
take
any
position
in
the
school
you
must
make
up
your
mind
that
while
in
school
you
must
work
and
while
out
of
school
i
must
play
retorted
kitty
ah
then
little
of
the
play
i
get
if
i
had
my
share
of
the
play
i
could
do
my
share
of
work
come
you
must
not
answer
me
said
miss
worrick
now
sit
down
and
read
up
that
chapter
in
your
history
you
will
not
be
allowed
to
go
out
during
recess
this
morning
not
go
out
during
recess
cried
kitty
in
horror
but
it
most
important
ah
now
do
let
me
out
just
excuse
me
wo
you
i
be
as
good
as
gold
and
better
but
excuse

really

was
to

would
be
awfully
if

with
her
you

me
out
wo
you
please
say
yes
i
do
not
understand
you
miss
malone
when
i
say
a
thing
i
mean
it
you
are
not
to
go
out
during
recess
kitty
bright
face
fell
the
cloud
which
had
more
or
less
hovered
round
her
during
the
entire
morning
deepened
she
sank
into
her
seat
with
a
heavy
sigh
never
mind
kitty
we
all
of
us
have
to
stay
in
sometimes
whispered
little
mary
davies
take
a
chocolate
out
of
my
pocket
darlin
and
do
talk
to
me
any
more
was
kitty
answer
i
am
sad
past
bearing
not
to
see
gwin
when
i
had
arranged
it
all
but
i
will
i
must
there
take
a
second
chocolate
if
you
want
it
they
are
full
of
cream
but
just
leave
me
to
my
own
thoughts
for
a
bit
i
am
so
worried
i
do
know
whether
i
am
on
my
head
or
my
heels
silence
girls
no
whispering
called
the
mathematical
teacher
who
now
came
on
the
scene
poor
kitty
morning
began
badly
and
it
certainly
was
destined
to
go
on
badly
none
of
her
lessons
were
prepared
with
the
slightest
care
she
went
down
lower
and
lower
in
class
and
each
teacher
gave
her
an
imposition
or
some
other
punishment
when
recess
came
she
alone
in
the
whole
class
was
required
to
remain
in
the
room
the
rest
of
the
girls
looked
at
her
with
pity
she
such
an
old
dear
although
quite
the
idlest
and
most
ignorant
person
i
ever
came
across
said
mary
davies
to
her
companions
yes
whispered
another
little
girl
with
fat
rosy
cheeks
and
round
eyes
but
did
you
ever
taste
such
chocolate
creams
why
they
must
cost
a
halfpenny
apiece
i
do
love
to
sit
next
to
her
she
says
i
may
dive
my
hand
into
her
pocket
as
often
as
i
like
oh
she
an
old
love
echoed
all
the
girls
but
what
a
pity
it
is
that
she
wo
learn
she
does
not
want
to
learn
said
mary
davies
learning
would
spoil
her
she
is
a
pet
meanwhile
in
the
playground
gwin
harley
waited
in
vain
for
kitty
to
join
her
does
any
one
know
where
kitty
malone
is
she
said
addressing
one
of
the
girls
in
kitty
class
she
is
kept
in
for
an
imposition
she
did
not
know
her
history
and
miss
worrick
said
she
was
to
stay
in
answered
mary
davies
oh
well
i
suppose
i
can
see
her
another
time
said
gwin
at
that
moment
she
met
elma
anxious
eyes
elma
was
just
about
to
dart
to
the
side
of
her
friend
when
to
the
amazement
of
all
the
girls
kitty
walked
calmly
across
the
playground
oh
gwin
i
must
speak
to
you
it
is
about
alice
you
know
you
and
alice
are
great
friends
things
get
worse
and
worse
and
they
are
almost
past
bearing
last
night
i
heard
her
sobbing
in
bed
she
sobbed
and
sobbed
and
at
last
i
could
stand
no
more
of
it
and
sprang
out
of
bed
and
bent
over
her
and
said
is
it
about
me
you
are
crying
and
she
said
yes
kitty
it
is
and
i
said
why
yes
kitty
what
has
poor
kitty
done
to
you
am
not
happy
answered
alice
you
came
everything
has
changed
you
have
made
my
home
miserable
to
me
i
do
like
your
ways
you
made
up
your
mind
never
to
be
friends
with
me
i
asked
said
alice
wish
you
would
go
away
she
sat
up
in
bed
then
with
her
face
and
looked
at
me
ever
so
earnestly
mother
that
you
would
rather
go
to
some
other
house
that
you
wo
stay
here
i
never
could
stand
vulgar
girls
and
you
are
one
oh
gwin
i
felt
so
mad
you
do
think
me
a
vulgar
girl
do
you
tell
me
the
whole
said
gwin
in
a
low
voice
oh
there
is
not
much
more
alice
was
in
a
regular
temper
she
buried
her
face
in
the
clothes
and
though
i
tried
pinching
her
and
pulling
her
and
petting
her
even
not
another
word
would
she
utter
now
you
must
see
for
yourself
gwin
that
if
this
sort
of
thing
goes
on
i
shall
have
to
return
home
and
then
the
old
dad
will
be
fretted
and
he
will
think
that
i
do
want
to
learn
manners
nor
to
get
learning
into
me
oh
dear
i
do
want
to
fret
him
although
i
hate
england
i
have
just
been
wondering
if
you
would
speak
to
alice
yes
certainly
answered
gwin
i
her
words
were
interrupted
miss
malone
do
i
see
you
in
the
playground
said
a
stern
voice
miss
worrick
had
appeared
on
the
scene
why
then
yes
miss
worrick
you
do
it
a
fine
day
is
it
and
the
air
is
most
refreshing
said
kitty
in
her
most
impertinent
tones
do
you
know
that
you
have
distinctly
disobeyed
me
i
forbade
you
to
leave
the
schoolroom
during
recess
how
dared
you
do
so
there
was
much
daring
about
it
i
walked
to
the
door
opened
it
and
came
out
i
had
made
a
previous
engagement
and
it
was
not
at
all
convenient
to
break
it
i
told
you
so
at
the
time
did
i
not
for
answer
miss
worrick
took
kitty
by
the
arm
and
led
her
across
the
playground
i
must
take
you
to
miss
sherrard
she
said
i
can
not
manage
a
disobedient
girl
like
you
she
opened
a
side
door
and
still
holding
kitty
by
the
arm
led
her
down
a
long
passage
and
into
a
small
room
where
she
desired
her
to
wait
while
she
fetched
the
miss
sherrard
was
a
little
woman
but
she
had
a
native
dignity
which
is
beyond
and
above
all
mere
personal
appearance
she
had
a
keen
and
commanding
eye
a
somewhat
pale
face
an
upright
little
figure
she
was
not
only
short
in
stature
but
slight
nevertheless
there
was
not
a
mistress
in
the
great
school
who
did
not
hold
her
in
awe
as
well
as
admiration
and
not
a
girl
with
the
exception
perhaps
of
kitty
malone
who
did
not
do
her
reverence
when
the
door
was
shut
behind
kitty
she
drummed
impatiently
on
the
bare
mahogany
table
near
which
she
had
been
placed
then
walked
to
the
window
and
looked
out
from
her
position
she
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
gwin
harley
pacing
up
and
down
the
playground
with
elma
lewis
she
saw
alice
come
up
and
talk
to
gwin
she
noticed
that
gwin
and
elma
paused
then
that
alice
slipped
to
the
other
side
of
gwin
and
the
three
walked
slowly
up
and
down
as
they
walked
they
talked
alice
nodded
her
head
once
or
twice
elma
made
emphatic
grimaces
gwin
alone
looked
quiet
calm
and
stately
they
are
talking
about
me
thought
the
irish
girl
and
an
angry
feeling
rose
in
her
heart
is
it
for
this
i
have
left
the
dear
old
dad
and
the
beautiful
home
and
the
animals
and
aunt
bridget
and
aunt
honora
oh
is
it
for
this
i
have
left
dear
old
ireland
may
her
heart
be
blessed
to
come
here
to
be
slighted
to
be
made
little
of
to
be
joked
at
am
i
kitty
malone
or
am
i
somebody
else
oh
my
heart
will
break
my
heart
will
break
miss
malone
i
am
sorry
to
hear
this
of
you
said
a
very
calm
very
distinct
and
withal
very
kind
voice
just
at
kitty
back
kitty
turned
abruptly
and
said
aloud
oh
and
did
you
overhear
me
she
then
involuntarily
dropped
a
courtesy
to
the
miss
sherrard
shut
the
door
behind
her
i
am
sorry
she
began
to
learn
from
miss
worrick
that
you
are
showing
insubordination
and
disobedience
why
then
now
and
wo
you
let
me
tell
my
own
story
in
my
own
way
said
kitty
in
spite
of
herself
miss
sherrard
gave
an
involuntary
smile
it
soon
vanished
but
kitty
had
caught
the
glint
in
the
eye
and
the
tremble
round
the
lips
why
then
i
see
at
a
glance
that
you
have
the
kind
heart
she
said
you
thought
to
keep
it
in
but
i
saw
it
breaking
out
just
then
you
let
me
tell
my
own
story
wo
you
that
seems
fair
enough
said
miss
sherrard
she
seated
herself
as
she
spoke
on
one
of
the
bare
comfortless
chairs
and
looked
full
up
at
kitty
kitty
was
dressed
according
to
rule
iv
of
the
society
she
wore
a
decidedly
fashionable
dress
the
sleeves
well
puffed
out
at
the
shoulders
fitting
nicely
at
the
elbows
and
with
ruffles
of
lace
real
lace
round
the
wrists
round
kitty
throat
also
there
were
ruffles
of
lace
the
neck
of
her
dress
was
cut
a
little
low
showing
the
soft
full
contour
of
her
throat
her
waist
was
clasped
with
a
belt
of
solid
silver
and
in
front
she
wore
a
great
bunch
of
the
has
a
scent
which
when
once
it
assails
the
nostrils
can
never
afterward
be
forgotten
miss
sherrard
in
spite
of
herself
gave
a
little
sniff
quick
as
lightning
kitty
saw
it
and
detached
the
bunch
of
roses
from
her
belt
now
will
you
have
them
she
said
ah
do
now
just
to
please
me
kitty
malone
they
came
all
the
way
from
old
ireland
this
morning
stay
i
pin
them
into
the
front
of
your
dress
hold
easy
a
moment
dear
woman
and
you
have
as
neat
a
little
bunch
as
ever
you
clapped
your
two
eyes
on
miss
sherrard
could
not
help
once
again
letting
that
ghost
of
a
smile
play
round
her
lips
and
then
vanish
but
really
she
said
oh
thank
you
for
the
roses
yes
they
are
very
sweet
yes
delicious
she
bent
her
head
and
sniffed
quite
audibly
ah
then
are
they
refreshing
and
are
they
melting
the
anger
down
in
your
heart
say
they
are
now
say
they
are
you
see
you
never
had
an
wild
irish
girl
to
manage
before
well
and
what
is
it
you
want
with
me
i
be
as
civil
as
you
please
and
as
willing
to
listen
to
the
words
of
wisdom
if
only
you
let
me
first
tell
my
own
story
it
is
only
fair
that
you
should
be
allowed
to
tell
your
own
tale
said
miss
sherrard
but
please
understand
that
i
am
very
angry
miss
worrick
story
has
amazed
me
do
you
know
kitty
malone
of
what
you
are
accused
well
i
do
and
i
do
but
i
should
like
to
hear
the
crime
spoken
of
by
your
pretty
lips
what
is
it
something
black
of
course
black
things
are
always
laid
to
the
door
of
kitty
malone
the
crime
miss
malone
is
the
very
grave
sin
of
disobedience
you
must
know
that
in
a
great
school
of
this
kind
if
there
were
not
perfect
obedience
there
would
be
no
order
at
all
true
for
you
it
looks
like
it
but
then
as
far
as
i
can
see
and
i
have
watched
all
the
girls
pretty
closely
of
late
i
am
the
only
black
sheep
now
i
should
think
that
one
black
sheep
in
a
great
big
orderly
place
of
this
kind
would
make
a
sort
of
diversion
you
would
all
be
after
her
and
joking
at
her
and
thinking
which
of
you
could
get
her
under
control
well
i
am
the
black
sheep
and
i
suppose
i
am
sorry
do
talk
any
more
kitty
listen
to
me
yes
what
is
it
you
have
been
disobedient
you
were
very
inattentive
over
your
history
lesson
not
knowing
it
at
all
miss
worrick
says
as
a
matter
of
fact
you
did
not
even
trouble
to
open
your
book
and
when
the
time
came
for
you
to
go
through
your
lesson
you
were
not
able
to
answer
a
single
question
for
this
extreme
carelessness
she
desired
you
to
stay
in
the
schoolroom
during
morning
recess
she
said
you
pleaded
hard
that
she
would
excuse
you
not
liking
to
take
the
punishment
which
you
richly
deserved
but
miss
worrick
very
justly
insisted
on
her
word
being
obeyed
what
then
was
her
astonishment
to
see
you
in
the
playground
walking
calmly
up
and
down
with
gwin
harley
yes
dear
and
what
else
could
you
expect
answered
kitty
what
else
could
i
expect
i
do
understand
well
was
it
likely
now
that
i
would
stay
in
that
close
stifling
schoolroom
when
the
sun
was
shining
and
there
was
a
bird
on
a
tree
outside
singing
to
me
as
loud
as
ever
it
could
and
i
had
made
an
arrangement
with
gwin
harley
to
walk
up
and
down
with
her
during
recess
and
the
darling
girl
had
put
off
two
others
for
me
and
was
waiting
for
me
do
you
think
it
was
about
natural
that
i
should
disobey
miss
worrick
whom
i
never
cared
twopence
for
and
go
out
to
gwin
harley
whom
i
love
of
course
i
knew
i
was
disobedient
and
i
supposed
she
would
punish
me
but
i
did
think
she
would
have
me
up
for
you
to
lecture
me
you
behaved
very
badly
indeed
said
miss
sherrard
and
you
are
now
talking
in
an
extremely
silly
way
kitty
bowed
her
head
the
light
went
out
of
her
eyes
her
face
turned
pale
what
punishment
will
you
invent
to
torture
me
with
she
said
at
last
in
a
low
voice
i
suppose
i
have
done
wrong
and
i
am
willing
to
take
the
punishment
what
is
it
of
course
you
must
be
punished
said
the
it
would
never
do
to
allow
disobedience
is
the
school
you
see
kitty
oh
bless
you
bless
you
for
calling
me
by
my
christian
name
muttered
kitty
malone
kitty
i
am
inclined
to
take
you
into
my
confidence
are
you
indeed
i
declare
you
an
old
dear
you
have
come
to
school
to
learn
have
you
not
not
a
bit
of
it
answered
kitty
i
came
to
school
to
please
the
old
dad
your
father
yes
the
dear
old
dad
the
dearest
the
best
in
the
world
but
what
did
he
send
you
here
for
well
i
suppose
to
get
knowledge
and
manners
ah
bad
luck
to
them
and
i
suppose
also
to
tame
me
down
a
bit
he
said
he
never
could
manage
that
at
castle
malone
miss
sherrard
once
more
gave
that
faint
involuntary
smile
your
father
sent
you
here
she
said
to
put
you
under
discipline
while
you
are
in
this
school
my
dear
girl
you
must
obey
me
and
also
the
other
teachers
if
you
are
disobedient
the
other
girls
will
be
disobedient
and
then
where
should
we
all
be
it
would
be
a
lark
muttered
kitty
with
sparkling
eyes
do
interrupt
and
please
listen
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
send
you
back
to
castle
malone
in
disgrace
i
should
be
sorry
to
have
to
write
to
your
father
in
order
to
tell
him
that
his
kitty
whom
he
loves
his
bright
pretty
lovable
daughter
can
never
learn
manners
nor
accomplishments
nor
be
tamed
in
the
very
least
there
are
from
six
to
seven
hundred
girls
in
this
school
who
all
now
know
about
your
very
daring
act
of
disobedience
were
i
not
to
punish
you
they
would
be
astonished
and
some
of
them
might
even
go
to
the
length
of
copying
your
behavior
you
see
this
for
yourself
do
you
oh
i
see
it
plain
enough
answered
kitty
plain
as
a
pikestaff
what
the
punishment
to
be
miss
sherrard
hesitated
once
more
she
looked
at
kitty
kitty
eyes
were
as
bright
as
stars
you
need
not
be
afraid
said
the
pupil
in
an
encouraging
voice
i
am
nothing
of
a
coward
i
take
anything
in
reason
is
it
a
flogging
you
are
thinking
of
ordering
for
me
oh
no
we
never
flog
in
this
school
said
miss
sherrard
in
a
shocked
voice
why
then
if
it
is
something
in
the
shape
of
learning
a
lesson
it
will
go
cruel
with
me
i
do
care
for
learning
and
i
am
afraid
kitty
that
i
must
give
you
the
kind
of
punishment
which
all
the
school
may
know
about
all
the
school
now
knows
of
your
disobedience
and
it
must
also
be
well
aware
of
your
punishment
good
gracious
this
sounds
exciting
answered
kitty
i
am
to
have
a
punishment
that
all
the
school
will
know
about
yes
it
is
this
morning
just
before
recess
you
are
to
go
up
to
miss
worrick
and
tell
her
before
the
entire
school
that
you
are
sorry
you
disobeyed
her
you
are
then
to
offer
to
stay
in
during
the
play
hour
if
that
all
said
kitty
it
is
not
much
of
a
bother
i
am
to
say
i
am
sorry
and
i
am
to
stay
in
you
wo
object
to
my
bringing
i
hear
of
no
conditions
answered
miss
sherrard
starting
to
her
feet
go
away
now
my
dear
girl
and
please
remember
that
your
father
sent
you
here
to
learn
that
i
trust
you
will
learn
and
that
you
will
also
endeavor
to
be
good
to
to
please
me
kitty
kitty
eyes
filled
with
sudden
tears
you
are
very
kind
she
murmured
i
know
i
should
soon
learn
to
love
you
you
would
mind
letting
me
give
you
a
hug
would
you
i
will
certainly
kiss
you
dear
but
no
demonstration
please
kitty
i
know
you
have
a
warm
heart
but
do
let
it
lead
you
into
mischief
there
is
much
for
you
to
learn
in
england
as
i
doubt
not
there
would
be
much
for
an
english
girl
to
learn
in
your
country
ah
but
it
is
the
dearest
land
in
all
the
world
said
kitty
i
am
sure
it
is
to
you
but
say
no
more
now
i
will
speak
to
miss
worrick
she
will
expect
you
to
do
what
i
have
desired
chapter
paddy
the
next
day
there
was
a
whisper
through
the
school
that
kitty
malone
was
about
to
do
public
penance
she
had
already
made
more
or
less
sensation
in
that
part
of
the
school
where
she
worked
in
her
own
class
the
girls
as
has
already
been
stated
adored
her
but
the
other
girls
also
looked
at
her
with
interest
they
admired
her
dress
her
free
careless
gait
her
upright
erect
figure
and
the
bright
happy
glance
in
her
eyes
they
all
thought
her
charming
and
the
expression
of
her
face
was
often
so
comical
the
shrug
of
her
shoulders
so
ludicrous
that
at
a
glance
she
set
the
girls
tittering
on
this
special
occasion
she
sat
down
between
her
favorite
mary
davies
and
agnes
moore
and
whispered
to
the
former
ah
then
darling
it
is
not
your
place
i
be
taking
sure
my
head
is
bothered
entirely
but
i
have
got
all
kinds
of
nice
things
about
me
do
you
know
that
i
sat
up
late
last
night
putting
a
pocket
in
the
left
side
of
my
dress
as
well
as
the
right
so
now
the
girl
on
each
side
of
me
can
have
as
many
chocolates
as
she
has
a
fancy
for
you
dive
in
your
hand
whenever
you
feel
the
least
bit
inclined
for
a
sweetie
agnes
and
you
do
the
same
mary
davies
and
mary
you
might
pass
one
on
now
and
then
to
that
poor
little
thin
katie
trafford
at
the
other
end
of
the
class
it
was
certainly
impossible
for
a
girl
like
kitty
malone
not
to
be
popular
and
the
other
girls
valued
her
and
thought
themselves
highly
privileged
to
be
in
the
same
class
with
her
dunce
as
she
was
kitty
had
learned
her
lessons
a
little
better
but
the
thought
of
the
public
confessions
which
she
was
about
to
make
rested
heavy
on
her
soul
it
made
her
restless
and
her
lessons
although
they
had
been
better
prepared
gained
her
no
more
marks
than
on
the
previous
day
i
wonder
how
i
ought
to
do
it
she
whispered
more
than
once
to
agnes
moore
to
do
what
asked
agnes
who
was
a
very
earnest
little
student
and
whose
dream
was
that
she
might
get
a
remove
at
the
end
of
the
term
about
what
kitty
i
wish
you
would
not
interrupt
me
oh
bother
it
dear
have
a
chocolate
wo
you
what
are
your
lessons
compared
to
my
perplexities
what
ought
i
to
say
ought
i
to
drop
a
courtesy
or
go
on
my
knees
there
was
an
old
romance
which
i
found
in
the
garret
at
home
and
when
the
heroine
did
wrong
she
always
dropped
upon
her
knees
and
folded
her
hands
and
raised
her
eyes
toward
heaven
is
that
the
way
i
ought
to
do
it
do
do
kitty
you
make
me
laugh
and
then
i
be
sent
down
please
do
talk
to
me
any
more
kitty
turned
her
attention
to
mary
davies
would
you
mary
go
on
one
knee
or
on
two
if
you
dip
your
hand
down
to
the
very
bottom
of
my
pocket
you
find
some
caramels
some
people
like
them
better
than
chocolate
creams
you
must
not
talk
to
me
any
more
or
i
get
into
disgrace
whispered
mary
in
a
low
frightened
voice
look
miss
worrick
has
come
into
the
room
now
do
open
your
history
book
there
a
dear
girl
kitty
bent
her
curly
head
over
her
book
she
was
really
interested
in
the
cruel
fate
of
the
but
at
that
moment
she
saw
nothing
but
the
picture
she
was
conjuring
up
each
moment
before
her
excited
imagination
the
tall
girl
asking
pardon
of
the
little
teacher
was
the
girl
to
go
on
her
knees
it
really
would
be
better
thought
kitty
i
be
lower
than
her
then
it
does
seem
ridiculous
that
the
big
should
ask
pardon
of
the
little
and
oh
miss
worrick
i
beg
your
pardon
were
you
speaking
to
me
i
was
kitty
stand
up
i
am
just
going
to
lecture
the
history
lesson
began
kitty
did
no
better
than
yesterday
it
came
to
an
end
the
mathematical
teacher
took
her
class
and
then
the
great
bell
was
rung
for
recess
just
at
the
moment
when
its
last
note
echoed
through
the
vast
school
miss
worrick
came
a
step
forward
into
the
room
and
held
up
her
hand
to
arrest
the
movement
of
the
classes
she
looked
at
kitty
with
an
expectant
expression
kitty
returned
her
gaze
and
said
nothing
kitty
malone
felt
glued
to
her
seat
for
a
moment
every
nerve
seemed
paralyzed
her
face
became
crimson
her
eyes
filled
with
ready
tears
she
looked
down
the
great
tears
splashed
upon
the
desk
before
her
at
that
instant
she
encountered
the
vindictive
and
delighted
glance
of
alice
denvers
kitty
had
confided
all
her
trouble
to
alice
on
the
previous
night
and
alice
at
the
time
had
pretended
to
give
a
little
sympathy
but
where
was
her
sympathy
now
i
hate
her
thought
the
irish
girl
no
one
else
would
be
glad
to
see
me
so
miserable
you
have
something
to
say
to
me
have
you
not
miss
malone
said
miss
worrick
in
her
stiff
precise
voice
kitty
staggered
to
her
feet
i
do
want
to
say
it
a
bit
she
grumbled
come
forward
my
dear
come
forward
kitty
left
the
protection
of
her
desk
and
staggered
across
the
room
miss
worrick
had
mounted
a
little
platform
all
the
other
teachers
stood
waiting
and
the
girls
waited
also
kitty
looked
round
the
eyes
in
each
face
seemed
multiplied
fourfold
the
room
seemed
to
be
all
eyes
she
longed
for
the
mountains
for
her
father
for
laurie
for
the
old
home
she
hated
the
school
she
hated
england
why
was
she
to
be
publicly
disgraced
oh
it
is
very
wrong
indeed
to
ask
me
to
do
it
she
cried
then
the
following
words
rushed
out
miss
worrick
i
am
sorry
i
disobeyed
you
yesterday
and
i
stay
in
class
yes
i
will
stay
but
i
hate
every
one
of
you
and
i
hate
england
and
i
wish
i
was
back
again
in
dear
old
ireland
oh
dear
oh
dear
oh
dear
why
was
i
ever
sent
into
this
horrid
cold
freezing
land
oh
my
heart
is
broken
my
heart
is
broken
kitty
sobs
were
distinctly
heard
across
the
great
schoolroom
she
returned
to
her
seat
miss
worrick
with
a
wave
of
her
hand
dismissed
the
rest
of
the
girls
kitty
bent
her
head
low
down
upon
the
desk
before
her
and
sobbed
louder
and
louder
at
last
she
felt
a
hand
resting
lightly
on
her
shoulder
i
know
i
did
it
dreadfully
miss
worrick
she
said
but
it
was
so
bad
why
did
you
make
me
why
did
you
make
me
there
kitty
it
is
over
now
and
you
will
never
disobey
your
teacher
again
as
long
as
you
live
said
a
kind
voice
and
kitty
raised
her
eyes
to
see
not
the
face
of
miss
worrick
but
that
of
the
oh
miss
sherrard
how
could
you
make
me
do
it
she
sobbed
it
in
me
none
of
the
malones
could
beg
anybody
pardon
and
i
could
go
on
my
knees
when
the
moment
came
because
they
felt
stiff
they
had
no
joints
in
them
i
could
not
do
it
properly
no
i
could
not
you
did
it
dear
but
not
very
well
you
did
it
however
and
you
have
learned
your
lesson
now
come
with
me
into
my
private
you
and
i
will
have
lunch
together
and
i
will
excuse
you
from
any
more
lessons
kitty
malone
never
forgot
that
next
hour
miss
sherrard
was
an
ideal
she
had
the
keenest
sympathy
with
girls
in
her
long
experience
she
had
met
girls
of
every
shade
of
character
the
bold
the
ambitious
the
timorous
the
idle
the
frivolous
the
noble
the
earnest
she
knew
all
about
the
christian
girl
as
well
as
the
pagan
girl
all
about
the
girl
who
had
a
terrible
battle
with
her
own
evil
pro
pensities
and
the
girl
whose
nature
was
so
amiable
so
gentle
so
sweet
that
life
would
be
comparatively
easy
for
her
but
although
she
had
been
of
the
great
middleton
school
now
for
several
years
she
had
never
before
met
quite
such
an
extraordinary
specimen
as
kitty
malone
where
however
others
would
see
nothing
but
a
spirit
of
frivolity
a
love
of
admiration
dress
pleasure
in
kitty
miss
sherrard
peeped
below
the
surface
and
discovered
some
really
noble
qualities
she
determined
to
be
very
gentle
to
this
wild
willful
girl
to
take
her
in
short
as
she
was
oh
i
wonder
you
care
to
speak
to
me
said
kitty
when
her
sobs
having
ceased
she
stood
looking
in
miss
sherrard
private
room
you
are
not
to
be
the
subject
of
our
conversation
at
all
for
the
present
kitty
said
miss
sherrard
lunch
is
ready
and
you
must
be
hungry
would
you
like
to
go
into
my
room
it
is
just
next
to
this
and
wash
your
hands
and
brush
out
your
hair
kitty
looked
at
miss
sherrard
small
and
hands
she
was
fastidious
to
a
remarkable
degree
about
her
personal
appearance
i
dare
say
my
hair
is
somewhat
untidy
she
said
i
might
as
well
take
a
squint
at
myself
in
the
glass
i
never
like
to
look
ugly
is
my
nose
very
red
miss
sherrard
never
mind
about
your
appearance
said
miss
sherrard
who
could
not
help
feeling
slightly
annoyed
at
what
she
considered
such
a
very
irrelevant
remark
i
expect
i
am
a
fright
said
kitty
standing
up
and
talking
half
to
herself
and
half
for
the
benefit
of
the
crying
always
spoils
me
now
i
knew
a
girl
at
home
and
the
more
she
cried
the
prettier
she
got
she
used
to
let
her
tears
roil
down
her
cheeks
in
great
drops
and
never
attempted
to
wipe
them
away
and
her
nose
never
got
red
and
her
eyes
only
got
bigger
and
quite
dewy
now
as
to
me
when
i
cry
my
nose
kitty
will
you
please
remember
that
i
am
waiting
for
lunch
interrupted
miss
sherrard
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
answered
kitty
she
ran
into
the
next
room
examined
herself
critically
in
the
glass
arranged
her
hair
dipped
her
hands
into
hot
water
and
came
back
looking
spruce
bright
pretty
and
once
more
restored
to
the
highest
i
said
yesterday
that
i
would
love
you
she
said
as
she
seated
herself
at
the
other
side
of
the
appetizing
board
oh
what
a
dear
little
pie
i
wonder
is
it
pigeon
pie
no
it
is
lamb
pie
answered
miss
sherrard
will
you
help
yourself
kitty
cut
herself
a
generous
slice
i
like
all
sorts
of
good
things
she
said
i
am
sure
i
was
meant
to
do
nothing
in
life
but
dress
well
and
look
pretty
and
have
the
nicest
food
to
eat
and
how
dare
you
interrupted
miss
sherrard
her
words
coming
firm
and
strong
the
expression
on
her
kind
face
arrested
the
idle
girl
silly
remarks
what
do
you
mean
asked
kitty
i
mean
this
miss
malone
that
you
are
a
girl
with
a
considerable
amount
of
ability
oh
now
that
i
have
not
got
with
a
considerable
amount
of
ability
continued
miss
sherrard
and
with
a
great
many
talents
talents
i
thought
talents
meant
genius
now
i
have
always
and
always
been
told
that
i
was
a
dunce
of
the
dunces
it
not
joking
me
you
are
is
it
miss
sherrard
no
kitty
i
am
in
very
sober
earnest
you
have
been
sent
to
me
to
make
something
of
you
well
my
dear
woman
i
am
afraid
you
wo
make
much
the
fact
is
i
am
wild
through
and
through
i
come
of
a
wild
stock
i
wish
you
could
see
us
at
home
and
laurie
and
you
must
tell
me
about
your
home
afterward
said
miss
sherrard
but
now
i
have
something
to
say
about
yourself
as
she
spoke
miss
sherrard
drew
her
cup
of
coffee
to
the
side
of
the
table
leaned
back
and
looked
fixedly
into
the
bright
and
lovely
face
of
the
girl
who
sat
opposite
her
you
have
read
your
bible
have
you
not
she
said
my
bible
cried
kitty
yes
i
read
it
every
day
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
why
you
do
suppose
we
are
a
lot
of
heathens
at
castle
malone
do
you
miss
sherrard
father
has
prayers
every
morning
and
we
all
troop
in
every
one
of
us
into
the
big
hall
oh
i
wish
you
could
see
the
hall
and
the
pictures
of
my
ancestors
and
afterward
you
shall
tell
me
about
them
interrupted
miss
sherrard
so
you
do
read
your
bible
every
day
then
i
dare
say
you
happen
to
know
the
beautiful
story
or
rather
parable
spoken
by
christ
himself
about
the
talents
yes
i
love
that
story
only
i
do
think
it
applies
specially
to
me
for
i
have
not
got
any
have
not
you
perhaps
i
can
find
that
you
have
kitty
gazed
at
her
mistress
very
earnestly
what
is
it
i
am
good
in
she
asked
after
a
pause
is
it
my
english
bless
you
they
tell
me
it
awfully
irish
it
certainly
is
kitty
then
i
do
know
any
music
although
i
can
sing
and
whistle
oh
i
can
whistle
anything
there
not
an
air
that
laurie
plays
it
he
that
has
the
genius
for
music
bless
the
boy
but
there
not
an
air
he
plays
that
i
ca
whistle
it
right
up
and
down
and
with
variations
too
yes
my
dear
yes
but
i
was
not
thinking
of
this
special
talent
now
let
me
tell
you
something
that
you
have
got
what
please
speak
you
have
plenty
of
money
i
never
thought
that
was
a
talent
cried
kitty
i
should
think
it
a
very
great
and
responsible
talent
you
have
been
given
that
money
to
do
something
for
god
he
wants
you
to
use
it
for
him
then
also
you
have
a
very
bright
attractive
loving
manner
oh
i
feel
every
word
i
say
it
not
manner
said
kitty
you
suppose
i
a
hypocrite
do
you
no
i
think
on
the
contrary
you
are
very
sincere
we
will
now
admit
that
you
have
got
two
talents
you
have
got
money
and
you
have
got
a
pleasant
manner
i
think
also
that
you
have
got
a
third
and
i
may
be
able
to
prove
to
you
that
you
have
got
a
fourth
dear
me
this
is
most
entertaining
exclaimed
kitty
so
i
have
really
got
two
talents
and
you
think
i
have
more
what
is
the
third
i
do
wish
to
make
you
vain
but
you
have
yes
i
must
tell
you
a
remarkably
pretty
face
ah
now
what
a
darling
you
are
i
always
thought
you
were
sweet
what
part
of
me
do
you
admire
most
the
eyes
or
the
mouth
i
have
the
real
irish
eyes
i
know
yes
that
the
color
and
my
eyelashes
are
they
long
we
need
not
discuss
your
beauty
piece
by
piece
said
miss
sherrard
you
are
pretty
and
i
am
willing
to
admit
it
now
a
bright
face
like
yours
with
an
attractive
manner
is
a
gift
then
besides
you
have
you
will
be
astonished
when
i
say
this
lots
of
becoming
dress
which
adds
to
the
charm
of
your
appearance
kitty
if
you
were
all
you
might
be
if
you
would
use
that
money
which
god
has
given
you
that
beauty
which
god
has
given
you
that
attractive
manner
which
god
has
given
you
all
for
his
service
why
you
could
do
a
great
deal
in
the
world
you
could
make
it
a
better
place
a
brighter
place
a
happier
place
now
my
dear
child
your
father
has
trusted
you
to
me
he
wrote
to
me
a
great
deal
about
you
before
you
came
to
middleton
school
dear
old
dad
cried
kitty
he
loves
you
with
all
his
heart
i
should
think
so
the
darling
blessed
man
may
the
saints
preserve
him
as
your
father
feels
so
strongly
about
you
and
as
i
promised
him
to
do
what
i
could
for
his
child
will
you
help
me
kitty
will
you
remember
that
you
are
equipped
for
the
battle
of
life
much
more
bravely
much
more
strongly
than
most
of
the
other
girls
in
middleton
school
use
your
beauty
for
him
dear
use
your
attractive
manner
for
him
you
make
me
feel
very
solemn
said
kitty
she
rose
i
will
try
and
think
about
it
she
said
i
wish
i
was
not
quite
such
a
giddypate
but
i
try
and
think
about
it
miss
sherrard
kissed
her
and
now
i
want
you
to
do
something
more
she
said
you
wo
be
able
to
be
a
better
girl
than
you
were
in
the
past
if
you
do
pray
to
god
to
help
you
and
when
you
pray
kitty
ask
him
to
teach
you
to
restrain
your
feelings
a
little
not
to
let
them
all
rush
to
the
surface
to
keep
a
little
back
thus
you
will
gain
strength
of
character
and
and
be
all
the
better
for
it
my
child
you
are
very
good
to
me
said
kitty
i
do
mind
what
i
do
for
those
i
love
i
suppose
now
you
would
wish
me
to
learn
my
lessons
perfectly
every
day
i
certainly
should
and
to
to
turn
poor
little
agnes
moore
from
the
head
of
her
class
well
kitty
i
can
not
say
anything
about
that
ii
you
do
better
work
than
agnes
moore
you
will
get
to
the
head
of
the
class
and
she
will
go
down
but
i
doubt
your
being
able
to
do
so
for
agnes
is
a
very
clever
and
a
very
diligent
little
pupil
but
i
want
you
dear
soon
to
get
out
of
that
class
for
it
is
a
great
deal
too
young
for
you
i
want
you
to
be
with
girls
of
your
own
age
we
are
yet
one
month
to
the
end
of
the
term
by
the
end
of
term
i
want
to
be
able
to
tell
you
that
you
have
got
a
remove
and
now
dear
remember
i
shall
watch
you
and
yes
i
shall
pray
for
you
you
are
very
good
to
me
repeated
kitty
and
she
walked
out
of
miss
sherrard
presence
with
her
head
lowered
and
a
mist
before
her
eyes
for
the
next
few
days
kitty
was
strangely
thoughtful
she
did
not
speak
nearly
so
much
as
usual
she
felt
inclined
to
go
away
by
herself
and
she
was
much
puzzled
about
her
talents
miss
sherrard
words
had
made
quite
a
deep
impression
she
learned
her
lessons
with
care
and
had
every
chance
so
her
teachers
told
her
of
a
remove
at
the
end
of
term
even
alice
found
less
to
say
against
her
kitty
began
to
look
on
her
school
life
as
something
roseate
and
delightful
but
all
these
things
were
to
come
to
a
speedy
end
on
a
certain
afternoon
she
got
home
to
find
alice
out
and
denvers
seated
in
the
with
a
great
basket
of
mending
before
her
oh
what
a
lot
of
work
would
you
like
me
to
help
you
said
kitty
very
much
dear
but
what
kept
you
so
late
oh
here
is
a
letter
for
you
a
letter
cried
kitty
eagerly
oh
it
is
from
laurie
hurrah
hurrah
she
forgot
all
about
her
offer
to
help
denvers
with
her
darning
tossed
the
letter
in
the
air
two
or
three
times
and
then
sank
down
on
the
nearest
ottoman
to
read
it
these
were
the
words
on
which
her
eyes
rested
dear
old
kitterkins
i
have
got
into
the
greatest
bother
of
a
mess
that
ever
assailed
a
poor
gossoon
and
if
you
ca
help
me
old
girleen
well
i
shall
be
done
brown
as
the
saying
is
the
whole
matter
concerns
paddy
the
poor
creature
has
been
getting
queerer
and
queerer
lately
and
father
has
been
ever
so
much
worried
about
him
i
did
know
a
word
of
this
mind
you
at
the
time
but
learnt
it
afterwards
and
it
makes
my
bit
of
a
frolic
all
the
blacker
i
can
tell
you
father
got
milligan
to
go
and
see
paddy
in
his
cabin
at
the
top
of
sleeve
nohr
and
the
doctor
said
that
the
poor
old
boy
was
going
off
his
head
as
fast
as
he
could
and
we
must
be
careful
not
to
give
him
any
shock
well
but
to
come
to
my
part
of
it
you
know
that
coat
of
his
and
what
diversion
we
have
had
out
of
it
from
time
to
time
you
made
one
of
the
patches
yourself
do
you
remember
kitty
we
always
told
him
that
in
each
patch
he
had
concealed
a
sovereign
well
hot
as
the
days
are
he
has
been
wearing
that
coat
and
a
figure
of
fun
he
did
look
the
mahoney
boys
and
pat
and
i
thought
we
would
take
a
rise
out
of
him
so
one
night
when
he
was
asleep
we
stole
up
to
his
lair
and
got
hold
of
the
precious
coat
we
bundled
it
up
and
were
off
with
it
we
had
to
cross
the
lake
in
the
old
boat
with
a
hole
in
the
bottom
in
order
to
get
home
in
time
and
what
do
you
think
happened
up
came
a
squall
the
boat
was
upset
and
paddy
coat
sank
to
the
bottom
of
the
lake
we
swam
to
the
shore
and
thought
it
would
be
an
easy
matter
to
fish
up
the
old
coat
on
the
following
morning
but
although
we
dragged
and
dragged
and
pat
and
i
both
dived
down
to
the
bottom
a
good
dozen
of
times
the
coat
had
sunk
in
the
deep
mud
and
we
could
not
find
it
no
nor
a
sign
of
it
well
of
course
our
one
hope
was
that
no
one
should
know
but
what
was
our
horror
to
be
confronted
by
no
less
a
person
than
himself
you
know
that
craze
he
has
about
never
speaking
well
he
spoke
to
us
and
pretty
sharp
too
and
told
us
he
knew
we
had
taken
the
coat
and
did
he
look
thunders
and
daggers
at
us
and
we
funked
it
so
awfully
yes
i
will
confess
it
kits
your
brave
laurie
funked
it
like
anything
for
did
really
look
like
a
roadman
at
last
there
was
no
help
for
it
we
had
to
out
with
the
truth
oh
did
he
raise
a
yell
louder
than
anything
you
ever
heard
and
then
i
told
him
that
if
i
could
not
get
back
the
coat
i
would
give
him
ten
pounds
for
certain
by
saturday
next
he
said
if
i
did
he
would
lie
quiet
for
a
bit
and
not
tell
the
governor
so
i
want
you
like
a
blessed
girleen
to
lend
me
the
money
send
it
off
the
very
instant
you
read
this
for
if
you
do
the
saints
alone
know
what
will
happen
we
are
certain
to
be
sent
to
a
school
in
england
at
least
i
am
from
what
you
tell
me
kitterkins
of
that
place
i
should
think
it
would
break
our
hearts
to
smithereens
now
look
sharp
and
send
the
money
your
loving
brother
laurie
oh
dear
exclaimed
kitty
starting
to
her
feet
do
you
mind
my
going
out
at
once
mrs
denvers
certainly
not
my
love
tea
will
be
ready
at
five
are
you
going
far
only
to
elma
lewis
house
i
want
to
see
her
it
is
awfully
important
but
elma
lives
quite
two
miles
from
here
oh
that
does
not
matter
i
am
sure
to
find
my
way
it
is
most
urgent
said
kitty
she
rushed
out
of
the
room
pinned
on
her
hat
and
a
moment
later
was
walking
down
the
street
as
fast
as
she
could
go
she
crossed
a
field
and
a
common
and
after
a
time
got
into
that
part
of
the
town
where
elma
lived
by
dint
of
asking
half
a
dozen
children
and
three
or
four
policemen
she
at
last
reached
constantine
road
and
presently
found
the
right
house
she
ran
up
the
steps
and
sounded
a
rattling
on
the
knocker
the
moment
she
did
so
a
girl
with
a
mop
of
untidy
red
hair
peeped
up
at
her
from
the
area
below
come
and
open
the
door
at
once
called
kitty
why
do
you
keep
a
lady
waiting
the
girl
soon
appeared
tying
on
her
cap
and
apron
as
she
did
so
i
thought
as
they
was
all
out
for
the
day
she
began
oh
miss
i
beg
your
pardon
kitty
notwithstanding
her
rather
rude
words
presented
a
very
charming
spectacle
as
she
stood
on
the
steps
she
was
dressed
not
only
in
the
height
of
the
fashion
but
wore
such
a
perfectly
captivating
little
toque
at
the
back
of
her
head
as
to
fire
the
fancy
and
take
the
little
wit
which
she
possessed
out
of
lewis
maggie
had
never
seen
anything
so
captivating
nor
so
ravishing
a
wild
desire
to
make
a
toque
like
it
to
put
on
her
own
towzled
locks
on
the
following
sunday
caused
her
to
stare
so
hard
at
kitty
with
her
mouth
wide
open
that
she
did
not
hear
a
word
that
young
lady
was
saying
are
you
in
a
dream
asked
kitty
malone
i
want
to
see
miss
elma
lewis
is
she
at
home
miss
helma
no
miss
that
she
ai
replied
maggie
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
miss
but
it
it
the
bonnet
at
the
top
of
your
head
my
bonnet
said
kitty
yes
miss
oh
i
do
beg
your
pardon
miss
i
was
took
all
of
a
heap
yes
miss
i
attending
now
but
oh
if
you
would
just
turn
your
head
a
little
you
must
be
mad
said
kitty
but
her
eyes
began
to
sparkle
do
listen
to
me
she
continued
it
most
important
is
miss
elma
not
at
home
no
miss
she
out
for
the
day
and
so
is
the
missus
and
miss
carrie
they
all
out
in
their
different
ways
and
they
has
left
me
at
home
to
drudge
i
the
household
drudge
miss
and
no
wonder
took
with
anything
so
pretty
do
you
mind
telling
me
miss
if
them
wiolets
is
real
oh
the
violets
in
my
toque
are
those
what
you
are
staring
at
said
kitty
well
now
i
tell
you
what
i
do
i
give
you
the
whole
bunch
if
you
let
me
come
into
the
house
and
write
a
letter
to
elma
and
if
you
further
faithfully
promise
that
you
will
give
it
to
her
the
instant
she
comes
home
to
be
sure
i
will
miss
come
right
along
in
oh
what
a
beautiful
young
lady
you
is
every
one
tells
me
i
am
beautiful
thought
kitty
it
really
is
very
pleasant
i
am
more
flattered
here
than
i
was
in
ireland
people
told
me
there
i
had
a
face
like
cream
and
roses
or
cream
and
strawberries
and
father
used
to
say
that
i
had
washed
it
in
the
fairies
dew
and
laurie
would
tell
me
that
i
was
a
bouncing
girl
and
no
mistake
but
then
aunt
honora
was
always
saying
dear
beauty
is
only
skin
deep
and
do
be
set
up
by
it
child
handsome
is
that
handsome
does
kitty
oh
how
she
would
deave
me
with
that
old
proverb
but
here
they
seem
to
think
beauty
is
a
talent
and
i
ought
to
be
desperately
proud
of
it
oh
faith
but
why
do
i
think
of
these
things
when
my
precious
duck
of
a
laurie
is
in
the
mess
he
has
got
into
he
go
to
england
to
break
his
heart
the
darling
not
a
bit
of
it
not
while
his
kitty
has
her
wits
about
her
meanwhile
maggie
conducted
this
ravishing
and
welcome
visitor
into
the
tiny
furnished
her
with
pen
ink
and
paper
and
then
began
to
hover
about
near
the
door
in
order
to
get
another
view
of
the
lovely
cap
kitty
bent
her
head
over
the
sheet
of
paper
and
indited
a
letter
in
hot
and
furious
haste
dear
elma
i
am
so
sorry
but
i
must
ask
you
to
return
that
eight
pounds
to
me
immediately
i
want
it
for
laurie
he
has
got
into
trouble
and
requires
it
so
do
keep
me
waiting
a
single
minute
if
you
can
help
it
i
am
so
sorry
you
are
out
but
will
you
bring
it
to
me
the
instant

home

is
of
the
most
vital
importance
i
am
in
dreadful
trouble
and
nothing
else
will
save
laurie
yours
in
great
haste
kitty
malone
having
written
the
letter
kitty
looked
round
for
an
envelope
maggie
also
searched
to
right
and
left
but
could
not
find
one
but
it
will
be
all
right
miss
she
said
i
lay
it
just
as
it
is
flat
out
on
the
table
and
miss
helma
will
see
it
the
moment
she
comes
in
thank
you
answered
kitty
and
now
i
must
go
be
sure
you
give
it
to
her
her
the
instant
she
returns
and
tell
her
to
come
straight
to
me
with
the
money
for
i
must
send
it
off
whatever
happens
it
is
a
money
transaction
and
you
understand
do
you
what
is
your
name
maggie
miss
well
you
understand
maggie
that
any
transaction
connected
with
money
is
very
important
like
the
bank
of
england
miss
yes
to
be
sure
and
oh
miss
forgive
me
but
you
promised
me
them
wiolets
to
be
sure
i
did
kitty
snatched
them
from
her
toque
flung
them
to
maggie
who
caught
them
in
an
ecstacy
and
a
moment
later
was
running
home
as
fast
as
she
could
chapter
xi
in
carrie
bedroom
of
the
lewis
family
the
first
who
came
home
that
special
evening
was
carrie
she
walked
straight
into
the
little
where
kitty
malone
letter
lying
on
top
of
the
blotter
immediately
attracted
her
attention
it
need
not
be
said
that
she
instantly
read
it
and
not
only
once
but
twice
ha
ha
elma
i
have
got
you
into
my
power
at
last
she
said
to
herself
so
that
accounts
for
the
money
now
what
did
you
borrow
it
from
that
queer
irish
girl
for
but
now
that
i
know
a
thing
or
two
i
may
be
able
to
draw
on
you
to
a
considerable
extent
return
it
not
you
you
are
not
likely
to
but
i
think
i
be
able
to
frighten
you
i
shall
certainly
do
my
utmost
it
will
be
seen
from
these
remarks
that
carrie
was
by
no
means
an
amiable
girl
she
ran
up
to
her
room
took
off
her
hat
and
surveyed
herself
in
the
pale
blue
dress
which
had
been
purchased
with
some
of
poor
kitty
money
she
then
returned
to
the
and
folding
up
the
letter
deliberately
put
it
into
her
pocket
as
she
was
doing
so
maggie
came
in
to
lay
the
tea
oh
lor
miss
carrie
cried
the
as
she
spread
the
cloth
upon
the
table
whatever
become
of
that
bit
of
writin
that
was
lyin
atop
of
the
blotter
here
what
bit
of
writing
asked
carrie
turning
calmly
round
and
surveying
her
oh
a
letter
miss
i
do
know
what
was
in
it
but
it
was
a
money
transaction
as
important
as
the
bank
of
england
and
it
was
to
be
give
to
miss
helma
the
very
instant
she
come
did
you
see
it
miss
when
you
come
in
no
i
did
said
carrie
promptly
i
saw
no
letter
of
any
kind
here
the
blotter
there
is
nothing
on
it
it
may
have
got
between
the
folds
however
she
took
up
the
thick
pad
of
and
shook
it
but
no
letter
dropped
out
there
she
said
i
have
not
the
least
doubt
that
fido
jumped
on
the
table
and
took
it
up
and
ate
it
oh
lor
miss
you
do
think
so
i
should
not
be
surprised
fido
can
never
resist
paper
he
is
always
pulling
it
about
and
chewing
it
maggie
looked
frantically
under
the
table
for
even
stray
pieces
of
the
letter
but
she
could
not
find
any
if
he
had
ate
it
she
said
at
last
fixing
carrie
with
a
very
determined
stare
if
he
had
ate
it
he
would
have
left
some
bits
about
i
do
believe
it
i
believe
you
took
it
miss
carrie
oh
miss
for
shame
and
it
was
as
important
as
the
bank
of
england
a
money
transaction
miss
what
ought
not
to
be
trifled
with
i
ca
read
writin
though
i
can
read
books
fair
enough
but
the
young
lady
was
awful
put
about
what
young
lady
asked
carrie
you
had
better
tell
me
everything
oh
it
was
that
irish
young
lady
miss
malone
she
come
here
with
the
most
beautiful
on
no
it
was
wot
they
calls
a
talk
and
the
wiolets
in
it
they
might
growed
i
could
smell
and
she
come
in
distracted
like
and
writ
the
letter
and
told
me
i
was
to
give
it
to
miss
helma
the
very
moment
she
returned
and
that
miss
helma
was
to
take
her
the
money
what
money
is
more
than
i
can
tell
for
i
did
think
miss
helma
ever
had
any
and
she
said
it
was
an
important
transaction
and
i
said
it
like
the
bank
of
england
miss
and
she
said
to
be
sure
why
miss
carrie
you
have
not
gone
and
hid
the
letter
you
that
would
be
real
mean
of
you
look
here
said
carrie
what
did
you
say
about
those
violets
why
she
gave
to
me
miss
she
took
out
of
her
cap
and
she
give
to
me
and
i
was
to
give
the
letter
to
miss
helma
it
was
a
fair
and
honest
bargain
and
i
must
keep
my
part
of
it
miss
would
you
like
some
roses
to
put
with
the
violets
said
carrie
making
a
careful
calculation
roses
miss
that
would
be
prime
and
very
seasonable
would
they
miss
yes
violets
and
roses
look
very
pretty
together
and
i
pin
them
into
your
hat
and
furbish
it
up
and
look
here
maggie
you
can
go
out
with
your
young
man
on
sunday
i
manage
it
i
can
i
will
stay
at
home
oh
miss
carrie
you
do
mean
it
yes
i
do
i
manage
it
but
i
do
it
only
on
a
condition
what
is
that
miss
that
you
do
every
ask
me
another
question
with
regard
to
that
letter
and
that
you
never
never
on
any
account
breathe
a
word
of
it
to
elma
if
you
do
why
oh
miss
it
do
seem
fair
poor
honest
maggie
walked
to
the
window
and
struggled
for
a
few
minutes
with
her
temptation
the
thought
however
of
roses
to
add
to
the
violets
the
thought
also
of
joe
whom
she
dearly
loved
to
walk
with
her
on
the
following
sunday
proved
far
too
seductive
she
struggled
with
her
enemy
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
she
fell
once
and
for
all
i
have
the
roses
miss
carrie
i
ca
resist
them
and
the
thought
of
joe
on
sunday
joe
is
so
passionate
loving
miss
i
ca
resist
and
then
maggie
rushed
out
of
the
room
she
flew
to
her
attic
threw
herself
by
the
side
of
her
bed
and
burst
into
sobs
but
i
ought
to
done
it
she
said
several
times
i
ought
to
done
it
if
it
wor
for
the
roses
and
for
joe
i
stood
up
to
her
but
as
it
is
i
was
too
tempted
but
all
the
same
i
ought
to
have
done
it
no
i
ought
to
done
it
meanwhile
carrie
up
in
her
bedroom
was
thinking
hard
here
indeed
was
a
revelation
so
elma
possessed
eight
pounds
or
nearly
eight
for
carrie
knew
that
her
blue
dress
and
the
lobster
and
the
lettuces
and
the
stout
had
not
cost
a
great
deal
of
that
valuable
sum
of
money
at
the
present
moment
she
concluded
making
a
careful
computation
in
her
mind
for
she
was
a
smart
enough
girl
in
certain
ways
at
the
present
moment
elma
must
possess
the
sum
of
seven
pounds
or
thereabouts
what
in
the
world
did
that
irish
girl
lend
it
to
her
for
what
an
utter
fool
she
must
have
been
but
as
to
elma
paying
it
back
as
to
elma
getting
rid
of
those
riches
carrie
thought
she
saw
her
way
of
preventing
that
in
order
to
do
so
however
it
was
that
elma
should
not
see
poor
kitty
passionate
little
appeal
to
her
for
although
elma
was
anything
but
an
amiable
girl
carrie
was
certain
that
mere
fright
would
make
her
return
the
money
carrie
stayed
some
time
in
her
room
she
was
thinking
out
a
plan
how
could
she
prevent
elma
returning
the
money
to
kitty
malone
she
considered
rapidly
never
before
had
she
felt
so
full
of
energy
and
of
resource
it
suddenly
occurred
to
her
as
extremely
unlikely
that
elma
would
carry
about
so
much
money
on
her
person
suppose
she
carrie
had
a
thorough
good
hunt
for
it
now
on
the
spot
suppose
she
found
it
then
would
it
not
be
her
duty
by
taking
possession
of
it
to
guard
elma
from
giving
it
away
carrie
made
up
her
mind
quickly
she
determined
to
have
a
search
for
the
money
at
once
in
the
somewhat
bedroom
there
were
not
a
great
many
and
carrie
began
her
search
systematically
elma
and
she
had
a
little
set
of
drawers
each
there
were
no
locks
to
these
drawers
with
all
her
faults
elma
absolutely
trusted
her
own
family
it
never
occurred
to
her
even
in
her
worst
moments
that
carrie
would
examine
her
drawers
she
also
believed
that
maggie
was
perfectly
honest
carrie
now
began
to
search
she
opened
elma
drawers
and
looked
through
them
soon
she
found
what
she
sought
for
in
the
small
drawer
at
the
top
corner
was
a
little
parcel
it
felt
heavy
carrie
opened
it
and
there
lay
seven
shining
sovereigns
there
were
also
a
couple
of
shillings
and
a
few
pence
but
carrie
eyes
were
principally
fixed
upon
the
sovereigns
bright
and
new
they
looked
almost
as
if
they
had
just
come
from
the
mint
carrie
danced
a
pirouette
there
and
then
i
have
found
the
treasure
she
gasped
now
i
must
take
it
where
it
will
be
safe
i
know
what
i
do
i
give
it
to
sam
raynes
to
keep
for
elma
it
will
be
a
nice
excuse
for
seeing

more
of
me
if
he
supposes
i
am
wealthy
yes
i
take
it
to
sam
he
shall
keep
it
for
me
flushed
excited
her
heart
beating
high
carrie
once
more
pinned
on
her
hat
she
ran
downstairs
as
she
passed
through
the
hall
her
mother
was
letting
herself
in
with
a
latchkey
my
dear
carrie
she
said
you
are
not
going
out
again
at
this
hour
of
night
i
sha
be
long
mother
i
am
just
going
into
summer
terrace
to
see
the
raynes
i
wish
you
would
not
go
out
so
late
carrie
it
really
is
but
carrie
had
slammed
the
door
without
even
waiting
for
her
last
words
she
soon
reached
the
terrace
which
was
within
three
minutes
walk
of
her
own
house
florrie
raynes
let
her
in
my
dear
carrie
she
said
what
do
you
want
oh
you
naughty
girl
you
knew
sam
would
be
in
well
i
want
to
speak
to
him
can
i
see
him
just
for
a
moment
gasped
carrie
panting
and
breathless
pushing
the
hair
from
her
forehead
as
she
spoke
yes
come
right
in
said
florrie
you
need
not
apologize
he
is
only
having
a
cigar
and
he
be
right
pleased
to
see
you
as
she
spoke
she
opened
the
door
of
a
small
and
pushed
carrie
in
slamming
it
behind
her
the
echo
of
her
rude
laughter
as
she
performed
this
unladylike
feat
was
heard
down
the
passage
sam
was
seated
in
front
of
an
open
window
smoking
a
cigar
when
he
saw
carrie
he
removed
it
from
his
mouth
and
came
forward
in
a
somewhat
nonchalant
way
to
meet
her
now
car
he
said
what
up
any
news
can
we
have
a
jolly
time
next
sunday
yes
answered
carrie
panting
slightly
and
for
as
many
other
sundays
as
you
like
see
here
sam
i
can
not
wait
a
minute
now
you
know
you
once
told
me
that
i
was
a
frivolous
little
thing
that
i
was
extravagant
and
all
that
now
what
will
you
say
if
i
ask
you
to
put
seven
pounds
in
the
bank
for
me
seven
pounds
cried
sam
my
word
where
in
the
world
did
you
get
it
car
it
out
of
my
savings
replied
carrie
well
i
must
say
sam
gave
her
a
look
of
the
broadest
admiration
he
had
ever
yet
bestowed
upon
her
you
can
bank
it
for
me
can
you
not
yes
that
i
can
but
i
say
car
would
you
like
me
to
speculate
with
it
i
might
double
it
you
know
oh
do
what
you
like
with
it
only
keep
it
safe
answered
carrie
i
shall
want
to
draw
a
little
of
it
from
time
to
time
now
sam
i
ca
wait
another
moment
she
laid
the
money
on
the
table
sam
large
and
somewhat
fat
hand
closed
greedily
over
it
and
the
next
moment
it
was
conveyed
to
his
waistcoat
pocket
this
will
come
in
very
handy
for
myself
he
muttered
but
carrie
did
not
hear
the
words
she
ran
home
breathless
and
excited
she
thought
she
had
managed
splendidly
chapter
xii
the
spotted
leopard
kitty
was
miserable
that
night
an
irish
girl
has
always
her
ups
and
downs
she
is
either
up
in
the
seventh
heaven
of
bliss
or
she
is
down
almost
below
the
ordinary
earth
in
misery
kitty
was
suffering
from
an
intense
revulsion
of
spirits
laurie
was
in
trouble
he
was
the
best
brother
in
all
the
world
he
was
kitty
idol
there
never
was
anybody
more
reckless
more
passionate
more
than
laurie
malone
and
kitty
had
always
been
with
him
heart
and
soul
always
from
the
time
that
they
had
been
little
tots
together
and
now
laurie
was
in
danger
the
best
broth
of
a
boy
might
be
condemned
to
go
to
a
school
in
england
he
might
be
condemned
to
the
misery
the
want
of
freedom
which
she
was
now
enduring
oh
she
must
save
him
at
any
risk
she
could
do
so
she
could
send
him
ten
pounds
she
would
have
exactly
that
sum
in
her
possession
if
only
elma
returned
the
eight
which
she
had
lent
her
it
did
not
occur
to
kitty
as
at
all
difficult
for
elma
to
return
the
money
she
had
never
yet
know
money
difficulties
herself
and
when
elma
had
asked
for
the
loan
of
it
she
imagined
that
she
could
have
it
back
at
any
time
if
this
was
not
the
case
it
would
not
greatly
matter
but
now
of
course
laurie
letter
altered
the
complexion
of
everything
kitty
was
too
unsettled
and
anxious
to
stay
quiet
for
a
single
moment
she
fidgeted
alice
who
was
busily
engaged
preparing
her
lessons
for
the
following
day
kitty
she
said
when
that
erratic
young
person
had
jumped
up
to
lean
her
body
half
out
of
the
window
for
the
twentieth
time
if
you
can
not
sit
still
yourself
you
ought
to
have
some
thought
for
me
what
am
i
to
do
if
you
keep
rushing
to
the
window
and
back
again
to
your
seat
every
couple
of
minutes
i
am
looking
for
elma
said
kitty
for
elma
lewis
do
you
expect
her
yes
and
on
a
matter
of
vital
importance
oh
do
talk
to
me
please
alice
if
she
does
come
soon
i
believe
my
heart
will
burst
that
is
exactly
like
one
of
your
exaggerated
statements
said
alice
people
hearts
do
burst
oh
if
you
only
would
stay
quiet
i
believe
that
herself
turning
round
the
corner
cried
kitty
bending
out
so
far
now
that
it
was
a
wonder
she
was
not
overbalanced
really
kitty
you
make
my
heart
stand
still
said
alice
you
will
fall
out
if
you
are
not
careful
oh
for
goodness
sake
do
stoop
out
any
further
it
not
her
said
kitty
popping
in
her
head
i
was
only
stooping
far
enough
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
boots
elma
always
wears
such
horrid
shabby
boots
and
her
feet
are
too
large
by
the
way
alice
what
do
you
think
of
these
shoes
do
you
like
them
with
straps
across
and
little
rosettes
i
do
like
anything
in
the
way
of
dress
at
the
present
moment
said
alice
i
want
quiet
and
peace
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
do
anything
while
you
fidget
as
you
do
kitty
jumped
with
a
bang
into
the
nearest
chair
opened
a
novel
and
tried
to
read
it
upside
down
if
she
is
in
time
i
wo
be
able
to
send
the
letter
and
then
alice
do
you
mind
my
interrupting
you
for
a
moment
what
time
does
the
last
post
go
the
pillar
outside
the
gate
is
cleared
at
twelve
said
alice
it
is
only
nine
now
you
do
happen
to
be
able
to
tell
me
when
a
letter
cleared
at
twelve
would
reach
castle
malone
i
can
not
tell
you
forgive
me
kitty
i
can
not
stay
in
the
room
any
longer
i
am
going
to
our
bedroom
alice
gathered
up
her
books
and
swept
out
of
tho
room
when
she
reached
the
bedroom
she
shut
and
locked
the
door
kitty
was
now
left
alone
in
the
for
and
denvers
were
spending
the
evening
out
she
was
glad
of
this
as
she
could
lean
as
far
out
of
the
window
as
she
dared
and
there
was
no
one
to
shout
at
her
she
could
also
pace
up
and
down
the
room
which
she
presently
did
with
the
rapidity
and
eagerness
of
a
young
tigress
oh
to
be
back
again
at
castle
malone
what
was
laurie
doing
now
suppose
paddy
really
told
her
father
about
laurie
squire
malone
was
extremely
kind
to
kitty
there
was
no
saying
what
he
would
not
do
for
kitty
were
she
in
trouble
but
laurie
and
pat
were
different
matters
he
had
fits
of
them
only
fits
mind
you
for
he
was
too
irish
in
his
character
too
ever
to
keep
his
anger
long
but
in
these
fits
he
often
made
strange
resolves
and
when
these
resolves
were
made
as
a
rule
he
carried
them
out
he
was
too
proud
to
change
his
mind
if
once
he
decided
that
the
boys
were
to
go
to
school
to
england
to
school
they
must
go
to
prison
kitty
termed
it
tears
rose
in
her
bright
eyes
they
rolled
down
her
cheeks
oh
why
was
not
elma
in
time
how
dreadful
how
dreadful
if
she
kitty
missed
the
post
she
was
in
this
state
of
fret
and
worry
when
fred
entered
the
room
fred
hated
all
girls
with
the
exception
of
kitty
malone
he
could
not
be
said
by
this
time
to
hate
her
for
he
admired
her
very
much
indeed
the
moment
she
saw
him
she
called
out
to
him
to
come
in
ah
then
fred
it
is
you
come
along
in
she
cried
you
be
a
drain
of
a
comfort
not
much
but
still
a
drain
oh
fred
it
i
who
am
in
the
trouble
entirely
you
would
think
it
to
look
at
me
but
i
am
dear
me
kitty
i
am
sorry
said
fred
what
up
has
alice
been
teasing
you
as
usual
oh
bother
alice
as
if
i
minded
her
little
pinpricks
it
that
darling
laurie
in
ireland
he
has
got
into
trouble
the
broth
of
a
boy
that
he
is
she
then
related
what
had
occurred
in
connection
with
paddy
coat
and
the
poor
old
coat
is
in
the
bottom
of
the
lake
she
added
and
the
lake
is
feet
deep
in
mud
just
at
the
bottom
and
anything
that
falls
with
a
weight
into
it
would
sink
and
sink
oh
they
will
never
find
the
coat
till
the
day
of
judgment
and
it
full
of
beautiful
money
and
paddy
has
lost
the
little
grain
of
sense
he
ever
possessed
and
laurie
will
be
sent
to
one
of
those
prisons
to
prison
cried
fred
but
surely
your
father
oh
i
mean
a
school
it
all
the
same
do
interrupt
me
fred
when
my
mind
is
full
i
must
rattle
off
the
speech
somehow
and
he
wants
you
to
send
him
ten
pounds
yes
and
have
you
got
ten
pounds
to
send
him
to
be
sure
i
have
i
have
ten
pounds
ten
i
am
an
awful
girl
for
spending
money
i
bought
a
whole
pound
worth
of
chocolate
yesterday
i
only
wish
i
had
the
money
now
instead
but
poor
little
agnes
moore
and
the
other
girls
in
my
class
they
do
love
chocolate
and
they
quite
seem
to
fatten
them
i
bought
the
chocolates
and
i
have
got
ten
shillings
in
my
pocket
but
you
showed
me
a
whole
purseful
of
gold
the
other
day
said
fred
well
it
gone
fred
and
it
is
gone
but
i
know
who
could
help
me
to
find
it
if
i
could
catch
a
sight
of
her
and
who
is
that
asked
fred
elma
lewis
elma
lewis
do
you
like
her
i
ca
say
that
i
like
her
no
i
do
think
i
do
but
she
would
help
me
if
i
could
only
get
to
see
her
then
do
you
want
me
to
go
to
her
house
and
tell
her
so
why
fred
that
a
splendid
idea
you
are
a
jewel
a
darling
a
duck
let
me
fetch
my
hat
and
you
and
i
will
go
together
but
i
do
know
my
lessons
yet
it
is
that
beastly
german
i
have
pages
to
translate
it
is
such
rot
oh
what
does
the
german
matter
think
of
the
misery
poor
laurie
is
in
just
stay
where
you
are
fred
i
be
back
in
a
minute
kitty
dashed
upstairs
two
or
three
steps
at
a
time
and
thundered
a
loud
tattoo
on
the
locked
door
of
alice
bedroom
you
can
not
come
in
whoever
you
are
cried
alice
from
within
yes
but
i
must
alice
aroon
let
me
in
jewel
that
you
are
i
want
my
hat
and
gloves
and
jacket
nothing
else
do
for
goodness
sake
let
me
in
alice
asthore
but
alice
was
obdurate
once
let
kitty
in
she
would
never
be
able
to
get
rid
of
her
again
and
her
lessons
must
be
learned
they
were
specially
difficult
and
required
all
her
attention
then
if
you
wo
cried
kitty
whose
quick
temper
was
beginning
to
rise
at
least
fling
the
things
out
of
the
window
you
know
you
must
not
go
out
at
this
hour
if
you
wo
give
them
to
me
said
kitty
i
go
without
them
you
are
not
to
have
them
you
are
not
to
go
out
it
is
right
called
alice
who
felt
strong
in
the
cause
of
virtue
kitty
rattled
violently
on
the
handle
for
a
moment
longer
and
then
rushed
downstairs
again
to
where
fred
was
waiting
i
ca
get
my
hat
she
said
but
it
does
matter
i
go
as
i
am
now
kitty
dress
was
more
picturesque
than
suitable
she
had
on
a
crimson
blouse
and
a
skirt
bedizened
with
many
ribbons
and
frills
the
blouse
had
only
elbow
sleeves
and
was
cut
rather
low
in
the
neck
nothing
could
be
more
becoming
to
the
dancing
eyes
the
cheeks
the
head
of
dark
hair
lend
me
a
cap
of
yours
fred
there
a
darling
called
kitty
and
we
be
off
alice
is
in
one
of
her
tantrums
and
she
wo
let
me
into
our
room
nor
give
me
my
hat
and
jacket
if
your
mother
were
there
it
would
be
all
right
fred
only
thought
that
kitty
looked
remarkably
pretty
it
did
not
occur
to
him
as
at
all
queer
that
she
should
want
to
walk
a
couple
of
miles
in
this
erratic
dress
he
went
downstairs
accommodated
her
with
a
small
cap
which
bore
the
college
coat
of
arms
in
front
and
the
two
were
soon
hurrying
along
the
roads
at
a
rapid
rate
in
the
direction
of
house
there
were
two
ways
to
elma
home
one
way
was
by
crossing
a
wide
common
cutting
off
a
certain
corner
walking
down
a
and
so
by
a
series
of
short
cuts
reaching
constantine
road
by
the
other
and
slightly
longer
way
you
had
to
pass
an
open
thoroughfare
in
the
center
of
which
blazed
with
its
shining
lights
and
its
gay
exterior
a
large
called
the
spotted
leopard
now
the
spotted
leopard
was
by
no
means
a
nice
place
to
pass
at
night
men
considerably
the
worse
for
drink
were
apt
to
linger
about
the
doors
gossiping
and
idle
fellows
would
congregate
just
by
this
special
corner
ready
to
take
up
any
bit
of
fun
or
nonsense
which
might
be
coming
meaning
no
special
mischief
but
being
decidedly
disagreeable
to
meet
at
night
fred
was
as
careless
a
schoolboy
as
could
be
found
in
the
length
and
breadth
of
great
britain
kitty
was
equally
reckless
perhaps
more
so
if
that
were
possible
that
special
evening
fred
decided
that
they
would
not
take
the
short
cut
across
the
common
a
beastly
lonely
place
at
this
hour
of
night
he
said
and
the
road
is
so
uneven
and
there
are
no
lamps
we
go
round
by
the
leopard
you
do
mind
do
you
kit
never
a
bit
answered
kitty
come
along
fred
stretch
your
legs
i
must
get
to
see
elma
lewis
as
quickly
as
possible
fred
walked
fast
and
kitty
laughed
and
talked
and
danced
by
his
side
now
that
she
was
in
action
she
forgot
her
fears
her
volatile
spirits
rose
once
again
to
a
height
she
entertained
fred
with
numerous
stories
relating
to
paddy
laurie
and
pat
and
invited
him
to
come
to
castle
malone
for
the
whole
of
the
summer
holidays
assuring
him
that
the
fishing
would
be
splendid
the
cycling
superb
the
riding
such
as
would
make
your
eyes
water
and
the
shooting
and
the
hunting
when
that
season
began
all
that
could
stimulate
the
least
ambitious
of
boys
and
when
kitty
spoke
she
was
apt
to
illustrate
her
words
dancing
now
in
front
of
her
companion
now
keeping
by
his
side
now
lingering
a
little
behind
him
all
the
time
gesticulating
with
eyes
and
lips
and
gay
motions
she
was
like
a
restive
young
colt
beautiful
excitable
the
boy
felt
that
he
had
never
had
such
a
charming
companion
before
all
went
well
and
kitty
bizarre
dress
her
hair
tossed
wildly
over
her
head
and
hanging
partly
down
her
shoulders
her
little
feet
encased
in
the
shoes
with
the
rosettes
and
steel
buckles
the
frills
on
her
gay
skirt
her
bare
arms
failed
to
attract
any
special
attention
but
when
they
got
into
the
neighborhood
of
the
spotted
leopard
a
blaze
of
light
fell
full
across
her
she
was
a
remarkable
enough
figure
to
be
out
at
this
hour
and
when
joined
to
the
somewhat
peculiar
spectacle
the
boys
for
they
were
little
more
who
had
congregated
round
this
special
corner
saw
the
college
cap
on
her
head
they
made
a
rush
forward
and
the
next
moment
had
surrounded
her
they
began
to
laugh
and
to
make
facetious
remarks
it
was
all
done
in
a
second
kitty
stood
stock
still
as
if
some
one
had
shot
her
he
gay
manner
ceased
on
the
instant
she
drew
herself
erect
and
the
next
moment
aimed
a
blow
straight
from
the
shoulder
at
the
nearest
of
the
men
knocking
him
over
as
completely
as
though
he
had
been
a
ninepin
then
taking
hold
of
fred
arm
who
had
come
to
her
rescue
although
the
poor
lad
had
not
the
least
idea
what
to
do
marched
away
her
face
as
crimson
as
her
gay
silk
blouse
well
kitty
you
did
that
splendidly
he
said
the
impertinent
wretches
do
speak
to
me
about
them
answered
kitty
but
just
then
she
came
face
to
face
with
a
more
serious
obstacle
this
was
no
less
a
person
than
miss
worrick
herself
now
if
there
was
a
prim
mistress
in
the
whole
length
and
breadth
of
england
it
was
matilda
worrick
she
liked
girls
to
be
neatly
dressed
she
could
not
bear
to
see
them
out
at
what
she
called
inclement
hours
she
would
have
thought
it
the
height
of
impropriety
for
kitty
and
fred
to
walk
together
at
such
an
hour
but
when
in
addition
to
this
kitty
went
out
in
a
dress
which
miss
worrick
would
have
thought
very
unsuitable
for
home
when
she
wore
a
boy
college
cap
on
her
head
and
when
she
had
so
far
distinguished
herself
as
to
have
been
for
a
moment
the
center
of
a
lot
of
low
noisy
rough
men
miss
worrick
felt
that
the
moment
had
come
for
her
to
interfere
she
grasped
kitty
malone
firmly
by
the
arm
what
are
you
doing
miss
malone
she
said
how
dare
you
be
out
at
this
hour
how
dare
you
interfere
answered
kitty
who
excited
already
could
not
for
a
moment
brook
miss
worrick
interference
i
shall
march
you
straight
home
said
the
mistress
if
miss
sherrard
knew
of
this
she
would
expel
you
from
the
school
you
are
a
very
wicked
girl
fred
denvers
you
can
go
home
or
go
on
with
your
walk
just
as
you
like
but
i
have
charge
of
miss
malone
she
belongs
to
the
middleton
school
and
i
must
see
her
home
before
i
go
a
step
further
poor
kitty
felt
staggered
i
really
meant
no
harm
she
said
i
can
not
imagine
what
you
are
talking
about
i
could
not
get
my
hat
and
jacket
and
as
it
was
most
important
that
i
should
see
elma
lewis
fred
promised
to
take
me
to
her
house
please
do
ask
me
to
return
now
with
you
miss
worrick
i
really
can
not
come
but
miss
worrick
was
inexorable
she
grasped
kitty
very
firmly
by
the
arm
turned
abruptly
in
the
direction
of
home
and
walked
forward
with
a
firm
step
there
was
no
help
for
it
kitty
malone
must
accompany
her
they
soon
found
themselves
back
again
at
the
denvers
house
and
denvers
were
out
but
miss
worrick
inquired
for
alice
ask
miss
alice
to
come
to
me
immediately
she
said
to
the
servant
the
girl
looked
pityingly
at
kitty
who
was
a
prime
favorite
with
her
and
then
went
away
to
fulfill
her
errand
the
instant
alice
got
this
somewhat
startling
message
she
forgot
her
lesson
unlocked
her
bedroom
door
and
flew
downstairs
as
fast
as
she
could
miss
worrick
was
standing
in
the
center
of
the
kitty
was
leaning
up
against
one
of
the
kitty
face
was
red
her
hair
was
tossed
in
wild
confusion
and
her
dark
eyes
seemed
to
flash
fire
alice
said
miss
worrick
coming
straight
up
to
alice
when
she
appeared
i
must
ask
you
to
take
charge
of
kitty
malone
why
so
asked
alice
in
some
astonishment
just
do
what
i
say
your
father
and
mother
are
out
kitty
is
not
to
return
to
school
until
she
hears
from
miss
sherrard
in
the
absence
of
your
parents
i
put
her
in
your
charge
alice
she
has
behaved
disgracefully
and
i
shall
have
the
great
pain
of
reporting
what
i
have
just
witnessed
to
our
so
saying
miss
worrick
walked
quickly
out
of
the
room
and
out
of
the
house
well
thank
goodness
she
gone
the
old
cat
cried
kitty
now
kitty
what
have
you
done
said
alice
oh
this
is
terrible
fresh
scrapes
we
seem
to
live
in
constant
hot
water
what
is
the
matter
now
you
headstrong
and
dreadful
girl
nothing
is
the
matter
replied
kitty
absolutely
nothing
it
is
all
a
storm
in
a
teacup
but
if
any
one
is
to
blame
you
are
the
one
i
cried
alice
what
next
well
you
are
you
would
not
give
me
my
hat
and
jacket
i
have
a
nice
plain
hat
and
a
jacket
to
match
i
should
have
put
them
on
if
you
had
not
locked
our
bedroom
door
and
prevented
my
coming
into
the
room
which
is
just
as
much
mine
as
yours
as
it
was
imperative
for
me
to
see
elma
lewis
immediately
i
asked
fred
if
he
would
walk
round
with
me
to
her
house
and
i
wore
his
college
cap
when
we
were
passing
the
leopard
a
lot
of
rough
rude
boys
rushed
out
and
began
to
make
impertinent
remarks
about
my
dress
i
just
gave
one
of
them
a
black
eye
and
knocked
him
over
the
next
moment
i
found
myself
under
the
fire
of
miss
worrick
anger
and
small
wonder
said
alice
kitty
what
is
to
be
done
before
you
came
here
i
thought
myself
a
respectable
girl
all
we
middleton
girls
did
and
now
for
such
a
fearful
thing
to
happen
why
it
will
be
all
over
the
place
in
the
morning
they
will
talk
of
it
everywhere
oh
kitty
you
have
disgraced
me
for
ever
here
alice
burst
into
tears
good
gracious
cried
kitty
what
are
you
crying
about
i
did
nothing
it
was
the
rude
men
or
boys
or
whatever
you
like
to
call
them
who
were
to
blame
you
did
nothing
going
out
in
that
dress
cried
alice
that
red
blouse
and
your
arms
bare
and
with
fred
college
cap
on
your
head
i
should
not
be
a
bit
surprised
if
fred
were
expelled
he
will
certainly
get
into
an
awful
scrape
oh
dear
oh
dear
i
can
not
imagine
what
you
are
talking
and
crying
about
said
kitty
but
there
i
have
got
a
headache
and
am
going
to
bed
i
suppose
there
is
no
chance
of
my
oh
poor
laurie
what
a
wicked
girl
elma
lewis
is
kitty
rushed
up
to
her
room
not
that
she
was
frightened
that
was
not
her
way
but
she
saw
that
disagreeable
things
might
be
pending
in
the
meantime
her
most
anxious
thoughts
were
for
laurie
what
would
happen
if
she
could
not
send
him
the
money
by
an
early
post
chapter
xiii
coventry
early
the
next
morning
denvers
was
a
good
deal
surprised
by
receiving
a
letter
from
miss
sherrard
it
ran
as
follows
dear
denvers
i
have
just
heard
an
extraordinary
story
from
miss
worrick
with
regard
to
kitty
malone
she
met
kitty
with
your
fred
at
a
late
hour
last
night
just
outside
the
leopard
she
was
not
wearing
an
outdoor
jacket
and
had
the
college
cap
on
her
head
in
consequence
she
was
spoken
to
impertinently
by
some
men
outside
the
and
when
miss
worrick
came
up
had
just
knocked
one
of
them
down
miss
worrick
says
further
that
kitty
showed
her
great
impertinence
and
in
short
that
the
whole
affair
was
wrong
and
disgraceful
it
is
my
painful
duty
to
look
thoroughly
into
this
matter
and
i
should
be
glad
if
you
would
bring
miss
malone
to
middleton
school
this
morning
in
order
that
i
may
do
so
yours
very
truly
emma
sherrard
my
dear
alice
said
denvers
as
her
daughter
entered
the
room
what
does
this
letter
mean
alice
read
miss
sherrard
letter
hastily
it
is
exactly
as
i
feared
mother
she
said
exactly
as
you
feared
alice
what
do
you
mean
i
always
told
you
that
kitty
would
be
certain
to
get
into
trouble
sooner
or
later
well
she
got
into
trouble
last
night
but
what
occurred
what
occurred
said
fred
who
came
into
the
room
at
that
moment
i
thought
you
would
be
talking
about
poor
kitty
i
will
tell
you
exactly
what
did
occur
mother
but
first
i
want
to
say
something
else
kitty
is
just
as
nice
a
girl
as
we
ever
had
in
the
house
she
has
not
a
low
nor
a
small
thought
in
her
but
she
is
excitable
and
she
has
high
spirits
and
yesterday
evening
when
i
went
into
the
i
found
her
there
alone
and
in
no
end
of
a
fret
because
one
of
her
brothers
in
ireland
had
got
into
trouble
he
had
written
to
her
but
she
would
not
tell
me
what
he
said
for
some
extraordinary
reason
which
none
of
us
know
it
seems
that
elma
lewis
can
get
him
out
of
his
trouble
i
can
not
pretend
to
explain
what
this
means
but
such
is
the
fact
poor
kitty
was
wild
to
see
elma
and
she
asked
me
if
i
would
walk
over
to
her
house
with
her
of
course
i
promised
to
do
so
for
it
was
difficult
not
to
be
to
the
poor
thing
at
what
hour
was
this
fred
interrupted
denvers
it
was
rather
late
i
will
own
mother
about
nine
go
on
my
dear
boy
what
happened
then
now
it
is
alice
turn
to
get
into
your
black
books
continued
fred
darting
a
malicious
look
at
his
sister
she
does
like
kitty
and
nothing
that
kitty
can
do
or
say
is
right
in
alice
eyes
fred
interrupted
alice
mother
you
have
no
right
to
listen
to
him
i
am
bound
to
hear
both
sides
of
this
story
alice
said
denvers
fred
shall
tell
his
side
first
go
on
my
boy
when
i
arranged
to
go
with
kitty
she
ran
upstairs
to
the
bedroom
which
she
shares
with
alice
to
get
her
jacket
and
hat
but
alice
had
locked
the
door
and
would
let
her
in
i
heard
her
crying
out
and
begging
of
alice
to
do
so
or
at
least
if
she
would
not
to
throw
her
hat
and
jacket
out
of
the
window
but
no
good
nature
was
not
to
be
expected
from
my
amiable
sister
so
then
kitty
ran
down
again
and
said
that
as
the
night
was
warm
it
really
did
matter
a
bit
and
she
asked
me
to
lend
her
a
cap
i
took
one
from
the
peg
in
the
hall
never
seeing
that
it
was
one
of
the
college
caps
with
the
in
front
and
kitty
popped
it
on
and
off
we
set
we
neither
of
us
gave
a
thought
to
her
dress
and
we
walked
as
fast
as
possible
chatting
and
laughing
all
the
way
all
went
well
till
we
got
in
front
of
that
horrid
leopard
and
there
were
several
lads
round
the
door
i
suppose
dress
attracted
them
as
well
as
her
pretty
face
and
all
in
a
minute
they
surrounded
her
such
awful
cheek
but
do
you
think
kitty
would
put
up
with
their
impudence
i
never
saw
a
girl
like
her
she
just
aimed
a
blow
straight
at
one
of
the
fellows
and
knocked
him
over
as
if
he
were
a
ninepin
i
can
tell
you
she
had
the
laugh
on
her
side
and
i
believe
we
would
have
heard
anything
more
about
it
if
that
mean
spiteful
old
cat
miss
worrick
had
been
coming
round
the
corner
she
ran
up
to
kitty
and
took
possession
of
her
and
marched
her
off
home
and
put
her
forsooth
into
alice
custody
that
the
explanation
of
miss
sherrard
letter
mother
dear
dear
said
denvers
it
was
a
most
imprudent
thing
to
do
but
of
course
the
poor
child
meant
no
harm
i
should
rather
think
she
did
cried
fred
the
one
you
ought
really
to
blame
is
alice
no
one
would
have
looked
at
kitty
nor
thought
of
her
one
way
or
the
other
if
alice
had
let
her
get
her
hat
and
jacket
but
what
was
she
to
do
when
she
was
locked
out
of
her
own
bedroom
but
she
know
very
well
that
she
was
breaking
rules
said
denvers
none
of
the
middleton
girls
are
allowed
to
go
out
so
late
in
the
evening
except
with
a
suitable
escort
and
she
certainly
ought
not
to
have
gone
in
the
dress
you
have
described
my
boy
it
was
all
thoughtlessness
but
she
will
get
into
sad
trouble
i
fear
of
course
it
was
thoughtlessness
said
fred
and
the
poor
thing
was
bothered
dreadfully
bothered
about
that
brother
in
ireland
i
see
mother
said
alice
that
you
are
determined
to
take
part
whatever
happens
she
has
bewitched
you
like
all
the
rest
of
the
household
whom
have
i
bewitched
now
asked
kitty
who
entered
the
room
just
then
oh
my
poor
dear
child
said
denvers
you
have
got
into
a
terrible
scrape
see
this
letter
which
i
have
just
received
from
your
kitty
eagerly
seized
the
letter
she
was
looking
pale
and
not
like
her
usual
self
there
were
heavy
black
lines
under
her
eyes
the
poor
girl
had
spent
most
of
her
night
crying
the
thought
of
laurie
was
resting
on
her
soul
she
was
very
anxious
about
him
and
in
consequence
very
miserable
i
always
said
that
i
hated
england
she
cried
coloring
as
she
spoke
oh
i
know
dear
denvers
that
you
are
a
jewel
and
as
to
fred
he
is
no
end
of
a
darling
and
denvers
is
as
nice
as
a
man
could
be
but
there
alice
and
she
does
like
me
and
miss
worrick
ca
bear
me
and
half
the
girls
at
school
do
understand
me
and
for
the
matter
of
that
i
do
care
for
them
and
i
do
understand
your
stiff
proper
english
ways
i
am
far
and
away
too
wild
for
england
in
ireland
we
would
only
laugh
at
such
a
thing
as
happened
last
night
what
does
it
matter
what
sort
of
dress
i
go
out
in
and
at
what
hour
i
go
if
i
am
doing
right
all
the
time
i
wanted
to
do
something
for
laurie
for
my
dear
dear
laurie
who
is
in
terrible
trouble
please
denvers
let
me
go
home
again
let
us
both
go
to
miss
sherrard
this
morning
and
tell
her
that
it
is
all
no
use
kitty
malone
was
born
wild
and
wild
she
will
remain
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
let
me
go
home
please
let
me
go
home
my
poor
child
i
must
not
yield
to
you
said
denvers
you
have
been
sent
to
us
to
be
made
oh
do
begin
it
cried
kitty
do
begin
to
talk
about
all
the
things
you
have
got
to
make
me
and
which
to
be
plain
none
of
you
will
ever
succeed
in
doing
for
i
was
not
half
nor
a
quarter
as
wild
in
ireland
i
was
considered
in
some
ways
the
steady
one
of
the
family
but
here
why
i
am
provoked
every
minute
of
the
day
and
i
i
ca
stand
it
much
longer
well
sit
down
now
and
eat
your
breakfast
said
denvers
for
we
must
soon
hurry
off
to
school
miss
sherrard
will
want
to
see
us
immediately
after
prayers
kitty
seated
herself
but
she
had
little
appetite
for
her
food
why
do
you
eat
said
fred
who
sat
next
to
her
let
me
help
you
to
some
of
this
porridge
it
jolly
well
done
this
morning

you
always

you

i
have
got
a
lump
in
my
throat
and
i
ca
swallow
answered
kitty

the
same
fred
there
are
some
chocolates
in
my
room
if
you
like
to
steal
up
in
the
middle
of
the
day
in
case
i
am
locked
up
as
twenty
to
one
i
shall
be
for
this
misdemeanor
there
are
some
chocolates
and
some
rock
and
toffee
you
find
them
in
my
drawer
in
the
corner
i
spent
a
whole
sovereign
on
sweets
as
i
told
you
a
few
days
ago
oh
thanks
kitty
you
are
a
brick
whispered
fred
back
in
return
you

take
as
many
as
you
like
fred
old
boy
for
you
are
a
comfort
to
me
i
tell
laurie
about
you
when
i
go
back
to
ireland
come
come
my
dears
no
whispering
said
denvers
kitty
if
you
do
care
for
your
breakfast
perhaps
you
will
go
up
to
your
room
and
make
yourself
tidy
for
school
oh
am
i
not
tidy
now
asked
kitty
jumping
up
and
running
to
the
glass
in
the
overmantel
to
survey
herself
by
the
way
do
you
like
my
frock
it
is
quite
new
do
you
think
this
crimson
cotton
with
the
white
sash
very
effective
it
is
cool
and
yet
it
gay
i
belong
to
the
tug
oh
i
must
not
mention
that
i
never
did
know
such
a
place
for
awful
secrets
as
england
i
am
drawn
up
every
minute
by
remembering
that
i
must
not
mention
something
but
how
do
you
like
my
dress
mrs
denvers
well
dear
i
prefer
quieter
colors
but
we
will
say
nothing
more
about
it
just
now
get
your
hat
kitty
put
on
your
outdoor
shoes
and
your
gloves
and
come
down
immediately
for
it
is
time
for
us
to
start
as
soon
as
kitty
had
left
the
room
alice
turned
to
her
mother
are
you
going
to
encourage
her
in
all
her
follies
she
asked
my
dear
alice
i
do
encourage
her
in
her
follies
but
there
is
no
use
in
pulling
the
poor
child
up
short
every
moment
she
expresses
herself
quite
correctly
when
she
says
that
she
is
wild
she
is
not
broken
in
but
to
break
in
kitty
malone
too
thoroughly
might
also
break
her
heart
and
that
would
never
do
break
her
heart
i
do
believe
she
has
got
one
said
alice
but
there
i
ca
talk
any
longer
on
the
subject
it
occurred
to
her
that
if
she
started
immediately
for
school
she
might
call
for
bessie
challoner
and
tell
her
what
had
occurred
sympathy
would
be
very
sweet
and
alice
determined
to
secure
it
if
possible
accordingly
she
left
the
house
and
at
about
a
quarter
to
nine
found
herself
at
bessie
house
bessie
was
standing
on
the
steps
drawing
on
her
gloves
why
alice
what
has
brought
you
she
cried
and
where
is
kitty
oh
do
mention
kitty
if
you
do
want
to
rile
me
beyond
endurance
said
alice
i
always
do
rile
you
when
i
mention
her
answered
bessie
but
where
is
she
all
the
same
with
mother
she
is
coming
to
school
with
mother
with
your
mother
to
middleton
school
what
do
you
mean
only
that
mother
has
to
bring
her
she
has
got
into
no
end
of
a
row
has
she
oh
i
am
sorry
said
bessie
come
out
bessie
said
alice
it
is
a
little
early
to
get
to
school
but
we
may
as
well
walk
slowly
and
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
as
we
go
along
this
alice
did
enlarging
much
upon
kitty
dress
her
crimson
blouse
her
bare
arms
the
college
cap
on
her
head
and
her
little
shoes
with
the
buckles
and
rosettes
she
must
have
looked
very
pretty
said
bessie
bessie
you
really
are
enough
to
distract
any
one
do
you
see
the
impropriety
of
it
do
you
see
that
this
will
get
all
over
the
place
people
will
say
that
a
middleton
girl
dressed
so
unsuitably
so
loudly
that
oh
do
you
see
it
i
do
see
anything
in
it
except
a
silly
foolish
girlish
act
uncommonly
like
kitty
malone
said
bessie
you
are
determined
to
make
mountains
out
of
molehills
alice
no
i
am
not
said
alice
anyhow
she
added
in
a
tone
of
triumph
miss
sherrard
thinks
it
disgraceful
and
so
does
miss
worrick
i
suppose
you
will
not
go
against
the
opinions
of
your
own
mistresses
will
you
bessie
no
no
only
i
am
sorry
said
bessie
at
that
moment
the
two
girls
reached
the
school
gwin
harley
was
just
driving
up
in
her
and
elma
as
usual
was
hovering
near
come
here
elma
said
bessie
we
have
something
to
tell
you
what
is
it
asked
elma
eagerly
it
is
this
cried
alice
kitty
malone
has
got
into
the
most
awful
scrape
she
went
out
last
night
with
fred
in
her
red
blouse
you
know
that
silk
blouse
she
is
so
fond
of
wearing
i
know
it
is
sweetly
pretty
said
elma
oh
there
you
are
praising
everything
she
does
well
anyhow
she
wore
it
and
her
arms
were
bare
to
the
elbow
and
she
stuck
one
of
the
college
caps
on
her
head
what
will
butler
say
she
went
with
fred
to
see
you
by
the
way
elma
she
seemed
in
an
awful
hurry
to
find
you
she
was
in
trouble
about
her
brother
and
she
said
you
could
help
her
oh
nonsense
said
elma
but
she
had
an
uncomfortable
feeling
as
the
words
were
said
her
thoughts
naturally
flew
to
the
eight
pounds
which
kitty
had
lent
her
was
it
possible
that
kitty
wanted
that
lovely
that
beautiful
money
back
again
elma
had
felt
almost
as
if
she
were
living
in
fairyland
from
the
time
that
money
had
been
in
her
possession
she
would
part
with
it
whenever
the
day
came
with
extreme
reluctance
well
she
said
i
can
not
imagine
what
she
wanted
with
me
but
what
happened
some
rough
boys
outside
the
leopard
were
rude
to
her
and
she
knocked
one
of
them
down
then
miss
worrick
came
up
and
took
her
back
to
our
house
and
miss
sherrard
has
written
this
morning
to
say
that
mother
is
to
bring
kitty
up
to
school
and
that
she
must
have
the
whole
thing
explained
there
a
nice
state
of
things
at
that
moment
the
great
gong
was
heard
and
the
girls
were
obliged
to
troop
into
the
school
prayers
were
conducted
as
usual
in
the
great
hall
and
elma
gwin
alice
and
bessie
looked
in
every
imaginable
corner
for
a
sight
of
kitty
malone
she
was
not
present
however
and
they
were
obliged
afterward
to
go
to
their
without
having
caught
sight
of
her
beaming
and
brilliant
face
meanwhile
denvers
and
kitty
were
waiting
for
miss
sherrard
in
the
private
kitty
went
to
the
window
and
looked
out
i
like
miss
sherrard
she
said
turning
to
denvers
as
she
spoke
i
am
really
sorry
to
annoy
her
it
is
about
a
fortnight
ago
since
she
spoke
to
me
in
this
very
room
she
spoke
so
kindly
and
told
me
that
i
had
got
talents
i
was
astonished
for
i
thought
she
meant
cleverness
and
i
have
always
been
told
that
i
am
a
dunce
she
said
that
she
knew
i
had
good
abilities
and
that
besides
i
had
plenty
of
other
talents
nice
dress
and
good
looks
kitty
colored
and
flashed
a
glance
at
denvers
she
also
spoke
about
my
money
as
a
talent
oh
dear
i
felt
when
i
left
her
and
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
be
good
but
it
seems
useless
more
than
useless
oh
my
poor
money
my
poor
money
i
have
got
none
of
it
left
now
or
at
least
scarcely
any
my
dear
child
no
money
exclaimed
denvers
impossible
when
you
spoke
to
me
last
you
had
about
fifteen
pounds
kitty
my
dear
it
is
wrong
for
you
to
squander
money
in
that
fashion
but
i
have
squandered
it
denvers
not
really
i
have
not
got
it
with
me
it
is
true
but
most
of
it
is
safe
only
i
must
not
talk
about
that
there
another
secret
for
you
what
an
awful
place
england
is
oh
dear
dear
i
am
in
a
muddle
about
everything
i
ca
bear
to
stand
in
this
room
and
remember
miss
sherrard
talk
fancy
her
saying
that
even
my
dress
was
a
talent
now
there
something
in
favor
of
my
nice
red
cotton
and
my
dear
red
silk
blouse
and
fancy
her
saying
still
more
that
my
looks
my
pretty
face
was
a
talent
denvers
do
you
think
me
pretty
very
very
very
pretty
no
kitty
dear
not
so
wonderfully
pretty
as
that
but
you
have
an
attractive
face
miss
sherrard
is
quite
right
beauty
is
a
gift
although
it
used
to
be
my
idea
that
the
less
girls
were
told
about
their
looks
the
better
oh
but
that
all
exploded
love
cried
kitty
in
these
days
girls
are
told
when
they
are
pretty
just
as
much
as
they
are
told
when
they
are
clever
now
i
not
clever
not
a
bit
i
a
dunce
an
out
and
out
dunce
but
at
any
rate
i
got
a
pretty
face
and
i
promised
that
i
would
use
my
talents
for
for
the
best
here
she
lowered
her
face
and
a
thoughtful
and
beautiful
expression
came
into
the
great
big
eyes
but
it
no
use
she
added
i
am
bothered
entirely
every
day
of
my
life
and
i
am
just
going
from
bad
to
worse
hush
kitty
you
must
not
talk
in
that
way
hark
i
think
i
hear
miss
sherrard
step
as
denvers
spoke
the
door
was
slowly
opened
and
miss
sherrard
accompanied
by
miss
worrick
came
in
miss
sherrard
was
just
about
to
speak
but
before
she
could
utter
a
word
kitty
rushed
to
her
i
have
failed
darling
i
have
failed
entirely
she
gasped
out
i
meant
to
do
right
but
i
did
wrong
i
have
become
worse
and
worse
although
i
can
not
see
the
wrong
myself
but
miss
worrick
has
found
it
out
i
want
to
give
up
the
school
darling
and
to
go
back
to
old
ireland
they
do
think
so
badly
of
me
in
old
ireland
and
they
let
me
dress
as
i
like
and
go
out
when
i
like
and
and
i
am
not
fit
for
england
dear

to
dad
and

him

him

am
a
failure
as
far
as
england
is
concerned

old
man

sorry
but
he
understand
let
me
go
home
again
please
miss
sherrard

me
go
home
no
kitty
i
shall
do
nothing
of
the
kind
answered
miss
sherrard
you
must
not
kiss
me
just
now
my
dear
no
i
am
not
pleased
at
all
you
did
very
wrong
to
go
out
as
late
as
you
did
last
night
you
broke
one
of
the
strictest
rules
of
the
school
and
have
brought
discredit
upon
us
all
miss
worrick
will
you
please
relate
exactly
what
occurred
miss
worrick
now
stood
up
and
made
as
much
as
she
possibly
could
of
poor
kitty
little
escapade
in
front
of
the
spotted
leopard
the
story
so
described
made
anything
but
a
pleasant
picture
miss
sherrard
who
was
tenacious
with
regard
to
the
school
and
most
anxious
that
each
and
all
of
her
girls
should
bear
the
highest
character
for
quiet
and
orderly
behavior
was
deeply
annoyed
kitty
she
said
i
have
always
been
strangely
unwilling
to
punish
you
i
have
never
ceased
to
remember
that
you
have
not
been
brought
up
like
most
of
the
girls
here
that
you
have
enjoyed
a
freer
wilder
life
on
that
account
i
have
tried
to
be
very
patient
with
you
my
dear
but
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
i
have
no
alternative
now
i
must
punish
you
and
severely
for
the
next
week
you
are
to
stay
in
during
the
morning
recess
and
after
school
is
over
will
remain
here
day
by
day
to
learn
different
tasks
which
will
be
set
you
further
my
dear
and
this
i
am
sure
will
be
the
most
severe
part
of
your
punishment
your
school
companions
are
absolutely
forbidden
to
speak
to
you
and
you
must
give
your
word
of
honor
that
you
will
hold
no
communication
with
any
of
them
until
the
week
has
expired
this
very
severe
sentence
made
poor
kitty
quite
collapse
she
sat
down
on
the
nearest
chair
and
her
rosy
face
turned
pale
oh
i
can
not
give
my
word
of
honor
she
gasped
i
must
speak
i
must
at
least
speak
to
elma
lewis
you
are
not
to
speak
to
any
of
your
companions
with
the
exception
of
alice
denvers
in
whose
house
you
live
said
miss
sherrard
kitty
if
you
disobey
me
i
shall
have
to
expel
you
and
then
indeed
you
will
be
disgraced
for
life
my
dear
you
must
bow
to
my
authority
you
are
to
speak
to
no
girl
in
the
school
i
trust
to
your
honor
to
obey
me
in
this
particular
if
you
are
expelled
and
it
will
certainly
happen
if
i
find
that
you
are
not
keeping
your
word
you
will
be
branded
for
life
chapter
xiv
the
lost
packet
after
parting
with
kitty
miss
sherrard
went
back
to
the
school
as
she
did
so
she
said
a
few
words
to
miss
worrick
the
result
of
this
was
that
all
the
girls
were
summoned
to
appear
in
the
great
central
hall
when
there
they
were
told
very
briefly
miss
sherrard
standing
by
her
desk
as
she
spoke
that
miss
malone
was
in
disgrace
miss
malone
has
done
something
which
obliges
me
to
put
her
into
coventry
for
a
week
said
the
her
schoolfellows
are
forbidden
to
have
any
intercourse
with
her
if
she
attempts
to
speak
to
any
girl
belonging
to
middleton
school
with
the
exception
of
alice
denvers
in
whose
house
she
is
living
that
girl
holds
communication
with
her
at
her
own
peril
such
a
girl
stands
a
grave
chance
of
being
expelled
from
the
school
miss
sherrard
then
descended
from
her
platform
and
the
usual
work
of
the
morning
went
on
it
may
easily
be
guessed
that
kitty
malone
and
kitty
malone
only
was
the
subject
of
conversation
during
recess
what
had
she
done
why
was
miss
sherrard
so
very
severe
on
her
it
was
not
often
that
a
middleton
girl
was
given
such
a
very
terrible
punishment
alice
who
knew
all
about
it
and
bessie
who
knew
a
little
were
therefore
in
immense
request
girls
came
up
to
these
two
in
groups
to
find
out
what
was
the
matter
and
when
they
heard
from
alice
the
very
glaring
account
of
what
kitty
had
really
done
on
the
previous
night
they
listened
with
open
mouths
giving
vent
to
their
feelings
in
different
ways
the
larger
number
pronounced
kitty
conduct
to
be
the
height
of
all
that
was
disgraceful
is
it
true
said
one
that
she
really
wore
the
college
cap
oh
what
will
butler
say
if
he
finds
it
out
alice
you
can
not
mean
that
she
had
bare
arms
bare
from
the
elbows
oh
impossible
but
alice
said
another
tell
me
did
she
really
really
knock
one
of
those
horrid
boys
down
yes
like
a
ninepin
so
fred
says
replied
alice
oh
it
was
disgraceful
do
talk
of
it
any
more
my
cheeks
burn
whenever
i
think
of
it
but
after
all
alice
said
gwin
who
came
up
at
that
moment
tone
sounded
quiet
stately
penetrating
it
rose
above
the
din
which
the
other
girls
were
making
after
all
alice
do
you
think
that
you
were
to
blame
too
why
did
you
not
let
kitty
get
into
your
room
and
hers
if
she
wanted
to
go
for
a
walk
it
was
surely
natural
enough
to
ask
for
her
hat
and
jacket
you
refused
to
give
them
to
her
of
course
i
refused
said
alice
who
did
not
at
all
wish
to
share
any
of
poor
kitty
blame
kitty
knew
perfectly
well
that
she
was
breaking
one
of
the
school
rules
as
well
as
one
of
our
home
rules
by
going
out
at
such
an
hour
it
was
between
nine
and
ten
as
to
her
going
without
her
hat
and
jacket
such
an
idea
never
entered
my
wildest
dreams
no
bad
as
i
thought
kitty
i
did
not
think
her
bad
enough
for
that
there
is
no
excuse
for
her
she
is
well
punished
and
for
my
part
i
can
not
but
rejoice
for
my
part
said
gwin
gravely
i
am
extremely
sorry
i
like
kitty
i
like
her
much
she
has
her
faults
of
course
she
is
different
from
any
of
the
rest
of
us
she
is
wild
and
daring
and
eccentric
but
she
is
also
the
soul
of
honesty
and
candor
she
is
very
affectionate
and
very
generous
she
has
not
been
brought
up
in
the
least
as
we
have
been
things
we
think
wrong
are
not
considered
wrong
by
kitty
malone
as
she
herself
expresses
it
she
is
a
little
bit
wild
oh
i
am
sorry
for
her
dreadfully
sorry
and
i
think
miss
sherrard
has
been
too
severe
i
wonder
at
miss
sherrard
i
thought
she
understood
kitty
she
spoke
to
mother
so
kindly
about
her
yesterday
she
said
there
was
a
great
deal
of
good
in
the
irish
girl
as
she
called
her
and
also
said
that
she
was
very
glad
that
i
was
her
friend
although
miss
sherrard
does
not
know
any
of
the
rules
of
the
society
she
naturally
knows
that
we
have
formed
it
she
told
me
that
she
could
not
express
how
pleased
she
was
at
our
having
asked
kitty
to
become
a
member
girls
i
wish
i
could
speak
to
miss
sherrard
i
think
i
will
it
will
break
kitty
heart
to
be
kept
in
coventry
for
a
week
i
doubt
if
she
has
a
heart
said
alice
it
is
all
very
fine
to
talk
of
her
affectionate
ways
for
my
part
i
call
them
nothing
but
impetuous
she
is
vain
conceited
and
selfish
and
provided
she
gets
her
own
way
does
not
care
what
prejudices
she
rides
roughshod
over
oh
i
have
no
patience
with
her
but
said
bessie
challoner
who
was
standing
stolidly
by
looking
very
determined
and
very
quiet
what
did
kitty
want
out
at
that
hour
kitty
with
all
her
faults
would
not
break
the
rules
unless
she
had
a
strong
motive
what
could
have
been
the
matter
and
why
did
she
want
to
see
you
elma
said
gwin
can
you
throw
any
light
on
the
subject
elma
colored
first
and
then
turned
pale
several
pairs
of
eyes
were
immediately
fixed
on
her
one
girl
looked
at
the
other
and
a
few
nodded
significantly
elma
observed
the
looks
and
turned
away
in
hot
fear
i
do
know
what
she
wanted
with
me
she
muttered
the
rest
of
the
school
hours
passed
as
usual
and
just
before
dinner
when
the
great
school
broke
up
for
the
day
kitty
was
still
the
subject
for
conversation
gwin
lingered
a
little
behind
the
others
and
bessie
stopped
to
ask
why
she
was
doing
so
i
have
almost
made
up
my
mind
she
said
to
plead
with
miss
sherrard
for
kitty
oh
gwin
how
noble
of
you
i
respect
you
i
do
from
my
heart
but
i
tell
you
what
would
it
not
be
better
for
us
to
do
something
of
this
sort
why
should
not
all
the
girls
plead
for
her
that
would
seem
more
effective
and
stronger
would
it
not
suppose
we
wrote
a
letter
a
sort
of
and
sent
it
to
miss
sherrard
begging
of
her
to
forgive
kitty
this
time
and
taking
upon
ourselves
the
responsibility
of
her
future
conduct
oh
i
say
gwin
could
we
not
do
it
it
is
a
splendid
thought
said
gwin
much
much
better
than
my
talking
to
miss
sherrard
alone
look
here
bessie
could
we
not
manage
to
have
a
meeting
of
the
at
my
house
this
evening
oh
there
elma
i
ask
her
at
once
elma
come
here
elma
who
was
just
shouldering
her
books
preparatory
to
leaving
the
school
turned
when
she
heard
gwin
voice
what
is
it
gwin
she
asked
her
manner
was
a
little
nervous
gwin
hastily
repeated
bessie
daring
suggestion
oh
i
come
of
course
said
elma
but
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
apathy
in
her
tone
and
i
will
secure
alice
i
am
getting
quite
to
dislike
alice
though
said
bessie
gwin
promised
to
write
to
the
other
girls
at
once
and
it
was
finally
arranged
that
a
meeting
should
be
held
at
harley
grove
that
evening
between
four
and
five
elma
walked
home
alone
musing
much
over
the
aspect
of
affairs
i
wonder
what
kitty
did
want
with
me
she
said
to
herself
doubtless
it
had
something
to
do
with
that
money
kitty
was
in
despair
so
it
seems
oh
there
fred
denvers
perhaps
he
can
tell
me
something
hullo
fred
elma
stopped
fred
was
on
his
way
from
college
he
was
whistling
a
gay
air
and
did
not
see
elma
until
he
had
almost
reached
her
side
hullo
elma
he
answered
how
are
you
oh
i
am
very
well
fred
thank
you
but
have
you
heard
about
kitty
malone
how
everybody
does
cry
out
kitty
malone
it
will
soon
be
sung
by
the
birds
in
the
air
said
fred
kitty
malone
kitty
malone
what
the
matter
with
her
now
oh
she
has
got
into
the
most
awful
scrape
of
course
you
know
what
occurred
last
night
rather
said
fred
i
was
with
her
i
say
elma
she
is
about
the
pluckiest
girl
i
ever
met
did
she
hit
out
straight
from
the
shoulder
and
did
that
fellow
go
down
like
a
ninepin
i
do
believe
he
is
able
to
see
out
of
his
eye
why
that
little
hand
of
hers
is
as
hard
as
iron
who
taught
her
the
art
of
boxing
like
that
she
a
born
fencer
she
a
splendid
girl
i
never
met
any
one
like
her
elma
did
not
feel
so
much
annoyed
at
this
praise
of
kitty
as
alice
would
have
been
but
all
the
same
it
was
scarcely
gratifying
to
her
after
reflecting
for
a
moment
during
which
fred
was
preparing
to
continue
his
swinging
pace
toward
his
home
she
said
suddenly
but
where
was
she
going
fred
fred
big
blue
eyes
lit
up
with
a
sudden
light
of
intelligence
what
a
fool
i
am
he
said
you
perhaps
can
throw
light
on
this
mystery
she
wanted
to
see
you
elma
i
can
not
imagine
what
about
you
know
how
fond
she
is
of
her
brother
laurie
well
it
seems
that
laurie
got
into
some
sort
of
scrape
and
kitty
poor
girl
she
was
in
a
way
about
it
fretting
like
any
thing
and
she
said
no
one
could
help
her
but
you
can
you
tell
me
what
she
wanted
with
you
she
was
in
a
rare
hurry
to
get
to
your
house
of
course
i
can
not
tell
answered
elma
who
could
be
responsible
for
the
vagaries
of
kitty
malone
i
thought
i
would
ask
you
i
thought
perhaps
you
would
know
of
course
they
are
talking
about
it
at
school
and
they
are
wondering
what
i
can
have
to
do
with
it
it
is
anything
but
pleasant
for
me
i
can
tell
you
oh
you
manage
well
enough
you
fight
your
own
battles
well
what
have
they
done
with
her
at
the
school
you
look
quite
mysterious
i
forgot
i
had
never
mentioned
it
to
you
they
have
sent
her
to
coventry
miss
sherrard
has
done
it
we
are
none
of
us
to
speak
to
her
for
a
week
whew
said
fred
rounding
his
lips
for
a
prolonged
whistle
well
that
wo
bother
kitty
much
i
do
suppose
talking
to
you
would
be
much
of
a
loss
to
her
but
you
do
understand
fred
it
the
disgrace
and
gwin
harley
thinks
it
will
break
her
heart
and
but
i
must
not
tell
you
any
more
i
must
hurry
home
poor
kitty
anyhow
there
no
embargo
put
on
my
talking
to
her
said
fred
to
himself
poor
old
kit
poor
old
girl
i
make
it
up
to
her
if
i
can
fred
ran
home
as
fast
as
he
could
and
elma
continued
her
way
there
no
doubt
of
it
she
said
to
herself
she
wants
that
money
she
will
manage
coventry
or
not
to
ask
for
it
she
promised
me
faithfully
that
she
would
never
tell
that
i
borrowed
it
from
her
but
being
an
irish
girl
she
is
scarcely
likely
to
keep
her
word
now
that
she
is
in
trouble
for
some
unknown
cause
she
is
certain
to
blab
it
out
did
she
not
say
herself
that
she
could
never
keep
a
secret
oh
dear
what
an
awful
mess
i
have
got
into
if
it
gets
to
be
known
that
i
borrowed
eight
pounds
from
kitty
i
shall
be
expelled
if
there
is
a
rule
that
the
middleton
governors
are
strict
about
it
is
that
by
which
the
girls
are
forbidden
to
borrow
money
from
one
another
and
eight
pounds
is
such
a
large
large
sum
all
my
future
will
be
ruined
if
this
is
known
i
had
better
give
her
back
all
the
money
that
is
left
and
at
once
it
would
be
the
safest
plan
i
can
at
any
rate
let
her
have
seven
sovereigns
and
perhaps
if
she
has
that
she
will
not
say
anything
whatever
about
the
matter
how
miserable
i
shall
feel
without
it
but
anything
anything
is
better
than
the
dreadful
fact
getting
to
miss
sherrard
ears
that
i
broke
one
of
the
strictest
rules
of
the
school
and
borrowed
eight
pounds
from
kitty
the
society
would
never
again
have
anything
to
do
with
me
i
should
have
the
poorest
chance
of
remaining
in
the
school
it
would
get
to
aunt
charlotte
ears
yes
yes
all
my
future
depends
on
keeping
this
thing
dark
i
must
get
rid
of
that
dreadful
money
as
quickly
as
possible
i
thought
my
luck
was
going
to
turn
but
it
is
far
too
good
to
be
true
that
i
might
keep
such
a
large
sum
of
money
safely
poor
kitty
yes
of
course
i
sorry
for
her
but
she
is
certain
to
tell
on
me
she
would
think
nothing
of
getting
me
into
the
most
terrible
scrape
i
i
am
bound
to
think
of
myself
first
at
this
point
in
her
meditations
elma
reached
the
house
in
constantine
road
she
ran
up
the
steps
let
herself
in
with
a
latchkey
and
went
straight
to
her
room
she
opened
the
drawer
where
she
kept
precious
sovereigns
and
put
in
her
hand
to
take
out
the
little
paper
parcel
more
than
once
since
she
had
possessed
this
money
had
elma
examined
that
little
packet
getting
up
early
in
the
morning
to
gloat
over
it
looking
at
it
the
last
thing
at
night
but
always
taking
care
that
carrie
should
be
sound
asleep
it
gave
her
comfort
the
comfort
almost
of
a
miser
to
gaze
at
her
gold
she
used
to
forget
at
these
supreme
moments
that
the
gold
was
in
reality
not
hers
at
all
she
used
to
forget
everything
but
the
delightful
sense
of
possession
she
felt
as
if
she
could
never
spend
the
money
as
if
she
must
hoard
it
and
hoard
it
just
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
looking
at
it
she
knew
the
exact
corner
of
the
drawer
where
she
kept
it
no
one
ever
dared
to
meddle
with
drawers
she
kept
the
rest
of
the
family
more
or
less
in
awe
of
her
as
to
maggie
she
was
honest
as
the
day
but
what
was
the
matter
search
as
she
would
she
could
not
find
the
precious
little
packet
she
looked
frantically
here
there
and
everywhere
soon
she
had
removed
the
drawer
from
its
case
and
had
tumbled
all
the
contents
on
her
bed
nowhere
was
the
money
to
be
found
elma
face
turned
white
as
a
sheet
she
trembled
from
head
to
foot
in
the
midst
of
her
meditations
carrie
entered
the
room
my
dear
elma
what
is
the
matter
she
cried
a
glance
had
shown
her
what
was
really
wrong
a
smile
crossed
her
face
she
walked
deliberately
across
the
room
and
flung
herself
on
her
bed
how
hot
it
is
she
said
with
a
pant
dear
me
carrie
why
are
you
so
incorrigibly
lazy
said
elma
not
that
i
care
i
am
in
dreadful
trouble
i
you
look
like
it
said
carrie
what
is
the
matter
i
am
looking
for
some
money
money
what
money
are
you
likely
to
have
well
it
so
happens
that
i
have
some
a
good
deal
carrie
have
you
seen
it
have
i
seen
what
asked
carrie
in
a
provokingly
drawling
voice
why
my
money
how
did
you
think
i
got
that
dress
that
dress
which
you
are
racking
through
at
such
a
furious
pace
carrie
was
attired
in
the
pale
blue
it
was
carrie
way
to
have
a
dress
and
to
wear
it
morning
noon
and
night
destroying
all
its
freshness
the
was
already
dirty
and
how
do
you
think
i
got
that
dress
that
you
made
such
a
fuss
about
if
i
had
not
money
to
pay
for
it
i
am
sure
i
could
tell
and
what
more
i
did
care
said
carrie
what
is
vexing
you
now
elma
oh
what
a
commotion
you
are
making
in
your
poor
drawer
i
have
just
lost
seven
sovereigns
and
carrie
i
see
by
your
face
that
you
do
know
something
about
it
is
it
possible
that
you
stole
the
money
how
dare
you
accuse
me
of
such
a
thing
said
carrie
flaring
up
in
apparently
most
righteous
indignation
in
reality
she
was
enjoying
herself
immensely
she
had
made
up
her
mind
not
to
tell
elma
the
truth
at
present
by
and
by
she
would
tell
after
she
had
well
frightened
her
sister
but
certainly
not
yet
i
know
nothing
whatever
about
it
she
said
caring
little
for
the
lie
which
she
was
telling
i
am
sorry
you
have
lost
it
but
how
did
you
get
it
elma
was
silent
shutting
up
her
lips
tightly
the
sounded
and
the
girls
went
down
to
their
midday
meal
carrie
soon
perceived
that
elma
was
in
real
trouble
with
all
her
low
idle
careless
and
unprincipled
ways
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
she
was
fond
of
her
sister
she
made
up
her
mind
to
visit
sam
raynes
that
evening
and
get
him
to
return
the
money
poor
old
elma
she
said
to
herself
i
do
want
to
be
too
hard
on
her
it
is
not
the
fun
i
expected
when
she
looks
at
me
with
such
miserable
eyes
it
would
certainly
not
do
for
her
to
get
talking
to
maggie
you
leave
the
matter
to
me
i
may
have
a
clue
she
said
when
dinner
was
over
but
rest
assured
on
one
point
maggie
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
nor
has
mother
here
carrie
ran
upstairs
to
put
on
her
things
preparatory
to
returning
to
her
pupils
elma
was
now
alone
the
hour
was
three
at
four
she
was
to
meet
gwin
harley
and
the
rest
of
the
girls
in
the
meantime
she
knew
she
could
not
possibly
have
any
peace
of
mind
until
the
seven
sovereigns
were
discovered
lewis
had
gone
up
as
usual
to
her
room
to
lie
down
she
had
a
headache
and
was
in
very
low
spirits
elma
glanced
at
her
once
or
twice
and
determined
not
to
worry
her
but
maggie
she
considered
her
lawful
prey
she
had
given
carrie
no
promise
and
felt
sure
that
maggie
and
carrie
between
them
were
at
the
bottom
of
the
mystery
she
determined
to
go
into
the
kitchen
and
terrify
maggie
into
confession
that
young
woman
was
busy
giving
sundry
touches
to
the
charming
toque
with
which
she
intended
to
electrify
her
young
man
on
the
following
sunday
maggie
said
elma
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
oh
lor
miss
how
you
startled
me
cried
maggie
she
jumped
up
as
she
spoke
dropping
kitty
violets
to
the
floor
they
were
so
natural
so
beautiful
so
exactly
like
the
real
flowers
that
more
than
one
girl
had
remarked
upon
them
and
among
these
had
been
elma
as
they
lay
on
the
kitchen
floor
she
stooped
now
to
pick
them
up
where
did
you
get
these
she
asked
in
a
sharp
voice
oh
miss
helma
they
mine
and
you
have
no
right
to
was
the
quick
reply
where
did
you
get
them
maggie
you
a
bad
girl

must
have
stolen
them
i
steal

like
that
said
maggie
turning
first
crimson
and
then
very
white
they
was
give
to
me
by
the
young
irish
lady
by
miss
malone
miss
kitty
malone

the
prettiest
young
lady
i
ever
clapped
eyes
on
she
give
to
me
herself

maggie
said
elma
the
violets
do
matter

us
talk
of
something
else
do
you
know
anything
about
some
money
which
i
keep
in
my
drawer
upstairs
now
look
me
straight
in
the
eyes
i
miss
that
money
and
you
know
i
can
call
in
the
police
and
have
your
boxes
searched

you
know
anything
about
it
if
you
tell
me
the
truth
i
be
merciful
to
you
last
night
i
had
seven
sovereigns
in
my
drawer
but
now
they
are
gone

you
touch
them
maggie
tell
me
the
truth
and
at
once
i
touch
your
money
miss
i
did
know
you
had
any
that
i
did
poor
maggie
face
was
a
study
perplexity
despair
indignation
swept
over
it
in
a
sort
of
terror
miss
helma
you
cruel
to
talk
to
me
like
that
she
cried
me
touch
your
money
no
that
i
did
oh
miss
is
it
the
money
miss
malone
come
about
is
it
gone
a
wild
hope
flashed
through
elma
brain
to
be
discarded
the
next
moment
could
kitty
have
come
to
the
house
and
visited
her
room
and
taken
away
her
own
money
herself
what
do
you
mean
about
miss
malone
she
cried
she
come
here
miss
oh
miss
helma
do
look
at
me
so
scornfully
she
came
here
yesterday
and
asked
for
you
and
when
i
told
her
you
was
out
she
writ
a
letter
and
said
you
was
to
have
it
the
moment
you
come
in
and
that
it
was
as
important
as
the
bank
of
england
yes
that
she
did
and
she
laid
it
on
the
blotter
in
the
she
was
the
prettiest
young
lady
i
ever
set
eyes
on
and
she
took
them
violets
out
of
her
cap
and
give
them
to
me
she
was
in
an
awful
way
and
said
she
wanted
to
see
you
on
a
most
important
matter
i
do
know
what
she
wrote
in
the
letter
but
it
may
have
been
about
the
money
miss
of
course
it
was
about
the
money
said
elma
who
felt
more
and
more
uncomfortable
each
moment
but
where
is
the
letter
maggie
why
did
i
not
get
it
you
ask
miss
carrie
that
miss
she
come
in
and
oh
but
i
tell
any
more
but
you
must
and
shall
said
elma
she
took
hold
of
maggie
fiercely
by
her
arm
dragged
her
forward
to
the
light
and
looked
her
full
in
the
eyes
now
tell
me
every
single
thing
you
know
or
i
summon
the
police
this
moment
she
said
thus
adjured
maggie
fell
on
her
knees
and
made
an
ample
confession
chapter
xv
gwin
harley
scheme
elma
felt
nearly
driven
to
distraction
all
her
future
depended
on
the
character
which
she
was
able
to
maintain
at
school
she
did
not
and
she
knew
it
belong
to
the
best
class
of
girls
who
attended
middleton
school
elma
father
was
a
man
of
bad
reputation
he
had
long
ago
disgraced
his
family
and
had
been
obliged
to
go
to
australia
lewis
was
better
born
than
her
husband
and
when
trouble
came
a
sister
who
had
been
much
shocked
at
her
marrying
lewis
came
to
her
aid
she
did
not
do
much
for
her
but
she
did
something
this
sister
a
certain
mrs
steward
the
wife
of
a
clergyman
in
buckinghamshire
promised
to
look
after
elma
who
was
the
cleverest
and
most
presentable
of
the
two
girls
lewis
begged
that
elma
should
not
be
taken
away
from
her
and
mrs
steward
angry
with
herself
for
what
she
termed
her
folly
had
yet
yielded
to
her
sister
entreaties
she
said
she
would
give
elma
what
would
be
better
than
a
fortune
namely
a
education
and
if
when
her
education
was
finished
she
showed
intelligence
and
above
all
a
good
sterling
moral
character
she
would
do
what
she
could
to
place
her
in
life
her
present
intention
was
after
elma
had
gone
through
a
course
of
instruction
at
middleton
school
to
send
her
to
girton
thus
enabling
her
by
and
by
to
take
a
really
good
position
as
teacher
all
these
things
elma
knew
well
she
was
an
ambitious
girl
she
earnestly
desired
to
secure
a
good
position
for
herself
in
life
she
hated
her
sister
carrie
ways
and
detested
the
grumbling
weak
sort
of
character
which
she
could
not
but
see
that
her
mother
possessed
all
the
same
she
was
not
really
scrupulous
nor
it
was
only
that
the
little
mean
ways
and
the
petty
shifts
which
went
on
in
the
small
house
in
constantine
road
sorely
fretted
her
her
intercourse
with
girls
like
gwin
harley
and
bessie
challoner
could
not
but
raise
her
standard
carrie
manners
and
ways
disgusted
her
more
and
more
each
day
now
as
she
put
on
her
hat
and
prepared
to
walk
to
harley
grove
she
could
not
help
thinking
with
great
bitterness
of
the
calamity
which
had
come
upon
her
she
was
naturally
intensely
selfish
and
had
no
idea
of
sacrificing
herself
on
this
occasion
no
matter
to
what
subterfuge
she
must
be
obliged
to
stoop
she
would
never
never
let
any
of
the
middleton
girls
know
that
she
had
broken
the
rule
of
the
school
and
borrowed
money
from
kitty
for
a
middleton
girl
to
borrow
money
at
all
was
a
black
crime
but
for
any
one
to
take
advantage
of
kitty
innocence
her
her
wild
daring
reckless
ways
would
make
the
crime
all
the
blacker
elma
were
such
a
sin
to
be
discovered
would
be
if
not
expelled
from
the
school
which
was
extremely
likely
at
any
rate
tabooed
on
the
spot
by
all
the
nice
girls
who
went
there
above
all
things
she
longed
for
and
esteemed
popularity
such
a
course
of
treatment
would
be
intolerable
as
a
matter
of
course
mrs
steward
would
be
told
of
her
niece
transaction
mrs
steward
would
say
like
father
like
daughter
she
would
cease
to
patronize
elma
the
fees
for
her
schooling
would
be
withdrawn
and
elma
herself
must
sink
to
the
level
which
carrie
had
long
ago
reached
it
can
not
be
she
thought
whatever
happens
i
must
keep
this
miserable
story
from
the
ears
of
the
girls
and
mistresses
at
the
present
moment
i
am
fairly
safe
wild
and
reckless
as
kitty
is
she
would
not
dare
to
hold
intercourse
with
any
of
the
middleton
girls
now
alice
is
the
only
one
allowed
to
speak
to
her
and
alice
she
will
certainly
not
confide
in
for
she
so
cordially
hates
her
yes
i
know
perfectly
well
what
i
am
going
to
harley
grove
for
gwin
is
full
of
sympathy
for
kitty
so
is
bessie
challoner
romantic
and
silly
they
both
are
but
alice
at
least
will
be
on
my
side
i
will
oppose
the
petition
which
the
girls
intend
to
send
to
miss
sherrard
kitty
must
not
be
set
at
liberty
until
i
can
return
her
the
money
carrie
has
it
beyond
doubt
what
she
has
done
with
it
i
do
know
but
most
likely
i
shall
be
able
to
give
it
back
to
kitty
having
made
up
her
mind
elma
walked
briskly
forward
she
would
she
felt
certain
be
very
unpopular
if
she
opposed
the
vote
which
unless
she
did
something
to
prevent
it
would
be
carried
by
the
majority
in
favor
she
was
anxious
to
see
some
of
the
other
girls
it
was
that
a
majority
should
be
against
kitty
not
for
her
when
she
arrived
at
the
avenue
which
led
to
harley
grove
she
met
alice
and
a
moment
later
two
other
girls
of
the
names
of
matilda
and
jessie
forbes
came
pantingly
up
oh
do
wait
for
us
they
cried
seeing
elma
and
alice
linger
for
a
moment
at
the
gate
alice
said
elma
before
they
join
us
i
want
to
speak
to
you
are
you
for
kitty
or
against
her
how
do
you
mean
asked
alice
in
some
wonder
i
mean
are
you
going
to
vote
that
this
petition
should
be
sent
to
miss
sherrard
or
are
you
not
i
am
going
to
vote
against
it
of
course
said
alice
with
a
short
laugh
well
i
am
on
your
side
i
wish
to
say
so
you
elma
i
thought
you
would
never
oppose
gwin
harley
you
are
one
of
those
people
who
know
where
their
bread
is
buttered
why
do
you
take
my
part
on
this
occasion
because
said
elma
flushing
deeply
for
hardened
little
sinner
as
she
was
she
had
not
perfect
control
over
her
emotions
because
i
think
kitty
richly
deserves
what
she
has
got
it
would
never
do
to
have
this
sort
of
thing
going
on
at
the
school
but
look
here
alice
if
the
petition
is
not
to
be
sent
to
miss
sherrard
we
must
try
and
have
a
majority
on
our
side
why
should
we
not
secure
matilda
and
jessie
forbes
i
never
thought
of
that
said
alice
but
really
elma
now
i
come
to
consider
it
as
far
as
i
personally
am
concerned
i
do
much
care
it
matters
very
little
to
me
whether
kitty
gets
out
of
coventry
or
not
i
shall
have
to
speak
to
her
however
the
tide
turns
you
do
seem
strangely
eager
on
the
subject
when
i
join
a
certain
side
i
do
wish
it
to
be
the
losing
one
said
elma
as
calmly
as
she
could
hullo
matilda
how
out
of
breath
you
are
you
need
not
have
run
so
fast
you
could
see
that
we
were
waiting
for
you
well
you
see
said
jessie
forbes
who
was
also
panting
as
she
came
up
we
have
never
yet
been
to
harley
grove
is
it
not
a
very
grand
place
elma
was
it
not
kind
of
gwin
to
ask
us
and
oh
of
course
we
are
full
of
sympathy
for
that
poor
dear
kitty
malone
why
do
you
pity
her
asked
elma
coldly
because
the
poor
darling
did
know
any
better
does
it
not
seem
silly
to
make
such
a
fuss
about
such
a
trifle
i
ca
imagine
why
miss
sherrard
has
been
so
very
severe
i
do
agree
with
you
at
all
said
elma
i
think
kitty
richly
deserves
her
punishment
of
course
she
added
i
do
want
to
be
really
hard
on
her
but
unless
she
is
made
to
feel
shame
when
she
does
an
and
extraordinary
thing
like
she
did
last
night
she
will
go
on
doing
similar
deeds
and
get
the
whole
school
into
disgrace
oh
dear
yes
said
jessie
that
is
perfectly
true
and
i
should
not
like
father
to
know
that
one
of
the
middleton
girls
had
been
spoken
to
by
a
rude
boy
in
the
street
i
really
believe
he
would
take
us
both
from
the
school
if
you
think
so
said
elma
you
ought
to
oppose
the
petition
are
you
going
to
elma
certainly
but
you
are
a
friend
of
hers
are
you
not
of
course
i
am
i
am
very
fond
of
her
and
you
oppose
it
for
her
good
undoubtedly
altogether
for
her
good
and
miss
sherrard
does
know
what
is
right
said
matilda
in
a
thoughtful
voice
miss
sherrard
was
never
a
severe
teacher
we
all
love
her
dearly
and
she
is
very
fond
of
kitty
said
elma
i
know
that
for
a
fact
yes
and
so
do
i
know
it
to
my
cost
said
alice
shrugging
her
shoulders
she
walked
up
the
avenue
as
she
spoke
jessie
ran
after
her
what
side
are
you
going
to
take
alice
she
asked
miss
sherrard
replied
alice
shortly
meanwhile
elma
had
slipped
her
hand
gently
through
matilda
arm
and
looking
up
into
the
face
of
the
taller
girl
said
in
her
most
insinuating
voice
i
do
think
painful
as
it
is
that
we
ought
to
take
miss
side
gwin
is
so
enthusiastic
poor
dear
and
so
is
bessie
challoner
that
they
are
certain
to
be
led
away
by
their
feelings
now
miss
sherrard
is
the
most
sympathetic
and
kindest
of
she
would
not
have
given
kitty
so
severe
a
punishment
without
reason
that
is
true
said
matilda
only
of
course
you
see
elma
i
want
to
go
against
gwin
i
am
so
terribly
anxious
to
become
her
friend
i
admire
her
so
immensely
i
do
think
there
any
other
girl
in
the
school
to
equal
her
i
should
think
there
is
said
elma
with
sudden
warmth
i
am
sorry
she
has
taken
kitty
malone
part
poor
kitty
we
certainly
all
think
her
charming
but
if
father
were
to
hear
of
it
you
would
not
like
him
to
take
you
from
the
school
now
said
elma
just
when
you
have
such
a
good
chance
of
the
literature
scholarship
i
should
think
not
it
would
be
a
dreadful
blow
but
he
would
be
oh
i
can
not
tell
you
how
shocked
he
would
be
and
he
would
be
more
shocked
would
he
not
if
he
heard
that
you
had
taken
kitty
part
and
had
signed
the
petition
against
miss
sherrard
of
course
i
never
thought
of
that
i
declare
elma
you
are
clever
i
will
mention
what
you
say
to
jessie
and
tell
her
that
she
must
go
against
the
petition
elma
felt
that
she
had
won
her
point
there
would
be
at
least
four
girls
against
gwin
motion
and
probably
others
would
follow
their
example
when
the
girls
arrived
at
the
house
they
were
shown
immediately
into
gwin
pretty
private
study
gwin
was
standing
by
the
open
window
she
had
a
book
in
her
hand
but
was
not
reading
it
she
was
looking
anxiously
out
there
was
a
perplexed
expression
on
her
fine
face
and
her
large
deep
gray
eyes
were
full
of
emotion
i
am
so
glad
you
have
come
she
said
when
she
saw
the
girls
i
hope
all
the
girls
will
be
present
the
more
i
think
of
this
affair
the
more
certain
i
am
that
it
will
be
the
ruin
of
kitty
malone
elma
looked
sympathizingly
at
her
friend
alice
frowned
matilda
and
jessie
did
not
know
where
to
look
nor
what
to
say
if
they
had
not
met
alice
and
elma
they
would
have
certainly
gone
heart
and
soul
with
gwin
in
the
matter
sit
down
wo
you
girls
said
gwin
tea
will
be
ready
in
a
moment
are
you
not
thirsty
yes
it
a
very
hot
day
said
jessie
somewhat
timidly
and
you
had
a
long
walk
but
it
was
really
kind
of
you
to
come
we
wo
do
anything
until
some
more
of
the
society
arrive
but
perhaps
my
letters
have
not
reached
the
others
oh
i
know
the
hodgsons
are
coming
said
matilda
forbes
because
i
met
them
i
am
glad
of
that
ah
and
here
is
bessie
bessie
challoner
at
this
moment
entered
the
room
she
shook
hands
with
the
forbes
girls
whom
she
had
not
met
before
that
day
nodded
to
alice
and
going
up
to
gwin
began
to
whisper
in
her
ear
gwin
looked
more
anxious
all
the
same
i
am
determined
to
do
it
she
said
i
am
certain
miss
sherrard
will
be
very
angry
said
bessie
had
you
really
better
gwin
i
certainly
had
better
i
am
not
afraid
of
miss
sherrard
nor
twenty
miss
sherrards
when
i
think
i
have
a
righteous
cause
she
does
not
know
kitty
as
well
as
i
know
her
ah
here
you
are
she
said
as
the
hodgsons
two
rather
dowdy
but
affectionate
girls
came
quickly
into
the
room
what
this
gwin
cried
mary
the
elder
something
wrong
with
that
irish
girl
what
can
be
up
i
will
explain
everything
to
you
after
we
have
had
tea
ah
here
it
comes
gwin
walked
to
the
table
where
the
footman
now
placed
tea
and
cakes
and
began
to
dispense
the
refreshments
the
girls
stood
round
her
chatting
munching
cake
and
drinking
tea
the
afternoon
sun
poured
into
the
room
outside
it
was
cool
and
shady
gwin
went
to
the
window
and
drew
down
the
green
venetian
blinds
now
that
is
cooler
she
said
have
you
all
had
enough
yes
thank
you
answered
one
or
two
gwin
rang
the
bell
and
the
servant
came
to
remove
the
tea
equipage
and
now
to
business
said
gwin
what
i
briefly
propose
to
do
is
this
kitty
malone
is
in
trouble
as
a
member
of
the
society
the
rest
of
the
society
is
bound
to
support
her
i
am
most
anxious
that
she
should
get
all
the
support
in
our
power
she
is
not
like
any
of
us
she
has
been
differently
brought
up
what
she
did
last
night
was
the
result
of
impetuosity
and
overzeal
she
was
troubled
about
her
brother
and
for
some
extraordinary
reason
thought
that
elma
could
help
her
elma
can
you
throw
any
light
on
the
matter
none
whatever
answered
elma
in
a
stout
voice
she
went
out
with
the
college
cap
on
and
without
her
jacket
and
for
that
reason
some
rough
rude
boys
talked
to
her
and
she
knocked
one
of
them
down
in
trying
to
defend
herself
and
so
got
into
a
terrible
scrape
miss
worrick
it
seems
witnessed
the
transaction
and
she
told
miss
sherrard
miss
sherrard
was
very
much
annoyed
and
has
put
kitty
into
coventry
for
a
week
we
are
none
of
us
allowed
on
pain
of
instant
dismissal
to
speak
to
her
now
my
proposal
is
this
that
we
write
a
little
petition
and
each
of
us
sign
it
and
then
that
i
take
it
to
miss
sherrard
i
want
to
ask
miss
sherrard
to
allow
the
members
of
the
society
to
speak
to
kitty
i
want
to
ask
her
to
allow
us
all
to
do
our
best
during
her
week
punishment
to
show
her
that
this
wild
and
erratic
way
will
not
go
down
in
england
i
want
her
to
allow
us
to
do
our
utmost
by
kindness
to
overcome
kitty
wild
nature
i
have
scarcely
any
doubt
girls
that
miss
sherrard
will
approve
of
our
scheme
well
i
for
one
approve
of
it
most
heartily
said
bessie
challoner
i
believe
severity
would
ruin
a
girl
like
kitty
you
can
not
drive
her
she
must
be
led
thank
you
bessie
i
knew
you
would
feel
with
me
and
now
girls
i
will
put
this
thing
to
the
vote
all
who
are
in
favor
of
the
scheme
hold
up
their
hands
the
forbes
girls
looked
tremblingly
with
flushed
cheeks
and
glittering
eyes
at
elma
and
alice
their
hands
went
half
up
and
then
dropped
again
into
their
laps
it
was
the
fear
of
their
father
displeasure
which
prevented
their
going
altogether
with
gwin
the
hodson
girls
immediately
held
up
their
hands
but
alice
elma
matilda
and
jessie
plainly
showed
that
they
did
not
mean
to
sign
the
petition
is
this
possible
said
gwin
in
a
vexed
voice
i
surely
thought
there
was
not
elma
you
must
be
at
the
head
of
this
what
is
your
reason
for
not
joining
us
alice
looked
as
if
she
were
about
to
speak
but
elma
jumped
at
once
to
her
feet
i
do
join
you
because
i
do
not
agree
with
you
dear
gwin
i
believe
miss
sherrard
knows
a
great
deal
better
than
we
do
what
is
good
for
a
girl
i
am
certain
she
will
be
much
annoyed
by
our
interfering
and
for
my
part
i
think
a
week
in
coventry
will
do
kitty
malone
no
harm
i
am
surprised
and
disappointed
in
you
elma
said
gwin
alice
what
is
your
feeling
oh
i
absolutely
agree
with
elma
said
alice
i
think
it
would
be
a
rare
comfort
to
take
any
means
to
subdue
and
crush
out
of
sight
even
for
one
week
that
most
obnoxious
person
kitty
malone
the
unfortunate
part
is
that
i
shall
have
to
do
with
her
even
during
her
week
in
coventry
but
surely
said
gwin
in
some
astonishment
you
two
forbes
girls
can
have
nothing
to
say
against
kitty
it
can
not
injure
you
in
any
way
that
we
should
plead
for
the
mitigation
of
her
punishment
well
the
fact
is
this
said
jessie
standing
up
as
she
spoke
and
looking
very
miserable
father
is
most
particular
he
is
almost
faddy
you
know
gwin
and
if
he
ever
heard
that
a
girl
from
the
school
did
exactly
what
kitty
did
last
night
i
mean
that
she
went
out
so
late
against
rules
and
was
dressed
in
such
a
queer
way
and
was
obliged
to
knock
down
a
rude
boy
in
order
to
protect
herself
why
i
think
he
would
take
us
from
school
then
if
father
also
heard
that
we
had
gone
against
miss
sherrard
authority
we
oh
i
can
not
say
it
exactly
as
i
ought
but
gwin
i
would
rather
not
sign
that
paper
all
right
answered
gwin
in
some
vexation
then
my
scheme
falls
through
four
against
and
four
for
we
have
only
one
other
member
of
the
except
poor
kitty
herself
and
she
i
am
afraid
can
not
come
as
she
is
ill
with
a
bad
cold
well
i
shall
see
miss
sherrard
alone
and
must
take
my
chance
yes
if
you
please
that
would
be
much
the
best
plan
said
jessie
sinking
down
into
her
seat
with
a
sigh
of
relief
soon
afterward
the
little
party
at
gwin
harley
house
separated
there
was
a
feeling
of
restraint
over
them
which
gwin
guests
seldom
experienced
they
were
not
at
one
it
was
impossible
to
talk
any
longer
on
the
subject
with
which
their
hearts
were
full
gwin
was
anxious
to
prepare
the
exact
arguments
she
intended
to
use
with
miss
sherrard
she
looked
relieved
when
elma
made
the
first
move
of
departure
alice
jumped
up
also
with
alacrity
gwin
she
said
i
think
you
are
doing
wrong
to
interfered
in
this
matter
a
little
punishment
will
do
kitty
malone
no
more
harm
than
it
does
any
other
girl
of
course
it
not
pleasant
punishment
never
is
take
my
advice
and
allow
kitty
malone
to
shift
for
herself
gwin
made
no
reply
at
all
to
this
she
gave
alice
a
cold
nod
and
the
four
girls
who
now
formed
the
opposition
left
the
house
to
all
chance
of
my
friendship
with
gwin
said
jessie
forbes
rather
miserably
as
they
walked
up
the
avenue
oh
never
mind
jessie
you
did
the
right
thing
said
alice
what
is
the
good
of
toadying
i
hate
toadies
if
you
are
ever
to
become
a
friend
of
gwin
harley
you
will
see
that
she
hates
them
also
although
perhaps
i
am
wrong
to
say
that
here
she
glanced
somewhat
significantly
at
elma
elma
colored
and
turned
her
head
aside
when
they
reached
the
top
of
the
avenue
the
girls
turned
each
to
go
their
several
ways
elma
hurried
home
as
fast
as
she
could
i
must
get
that
money
by
hook
or
by
crook
this
evening
she
said
to
herself
i
wonder
where
carrie
has
hidden
it
bad
as
she
is
she
would
certainly
not
steal
it
from
me
oh
it
is
safe
of
course
and
i
must
get
it
and
manage
to
convey
it
to
kitty
and
then
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
do
care
how
soon
the
poor
thing
gets
out
of
coventry
when
elma
reached
home
the
first
person
she
saw
was
carrie
carrie
was
standing
on
the
steps
of
the
shabby
little
villa
in
constantine
road
talking
to
a
young
man
elma
never
condescended
to
have
anything
to
do
with
raynes
giving
him
a
very
cold
nod
now
she
was
about
to
enter
the
house
when
carrie
caught
her
arm
and
stopped
her
why
do
you
speak
to
sam
she
said
sam
this
is
my
sister
elma
how
do
you
do
said
elma
i
am
sorry
i
can
not
wait
now
i
want
to
see
mother
there
no
use
in
your
going
in
if
it
mother
you
want
pursued
carrie
she
has
gone
out
for
the
evening
duncan
has
asked
her
to
tea
i
am
glad
of
it
a
little
change
will
do
her
good
i
wo
keep
you
now
car
said
raynes
turning
to
carrie
and
giving
her
a
somewhat
clumsy
nod
he
looked
askance
at
elma
and
the
next
moment
had
clattered
down
the
steps
and
turning
the
corner
was
out
of
sight
what
a
creature
said
elma
i
wonder
you
have
anything
to
do
with
him
carrie
i
think
even
for
my
sake
seeing
that
aunt
charlotte
is
doing
so
much
for
me
now
stop
that
said
carrie
i
wo
have
a
word
of
abuse
against
sam
he
suits
me
very
well
i
not
a
fine
lady
and
i
never
mean
to
be
a
fine
lady
i
shall
be
very
comfortable
as
his
wife
some
day
and
i
want
you
to
abuse
him
whether
you
like
him
or
not
he
is
going
to
be
your
and
why
elma
how
tired
you
look
i
am
tired
and
worried
and
i
want
to
speak
to
you
said
elma
to
speak
to
me
answered
carrie
a
little
alarm
coming
into
her
voice
in
spite
of
herself
what
for
anything
special
are
you
prepared
to
make
me
a
present
of
another
dress
i
could
do
with
a
white
one
now
the
weather
is
getting
so
very
hot
and
sam
would
like
me
in
white
white
with
pink
ribbons
would
be
a
change
or
mauve
mauve
ribbons
look
so
sweetly
cool
with
white
i
am
not
going
to
listen
to
any
of
your
nonsense
said
elma
i
want
to
ask
you
a
straight
question
where
is
my
money
your
money
what
do
you
mean
what
i
say
i
have
heard
the
whole
story
from
maggie
and
i
can
bring
her
as
a
witness
you
have
put
that
money
in
hiding
and
i
want
it
at
once
there
carrie
like
a
dear
old
soul
do
own
up
let
me
have
the
money
without
any
more
delay
of
course
you
have
not
stolen
it
i
know
you
have
not
but
you
have
hidden
it
i
wish
you
would
give
it
back
now
if
i
ca
return
it
to
its
rightful
owner
i
shall
get
into
worse
trouble
do
let
me
have
the
money
back
carrie
face
also
now
became
pale
i
wish
i
could
she
said
in
a
frightened
voice
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
really
want
it
back
why
of
course
you
have
spent
it
oh
if
you
have
i
am
ruined
ruined
for
life
no
i
have
not
spent
it
but
the
fact
is
i
what
a
little
wretch
that
maggie
was
to
tell
she
could
help
herself
i
made
her
now
speak
out
carrie
oh
we
need
not
go
indoors
where
is
the
money
please
please
carrie
let
me
have
it
at
once
elma
troubled
face
her
trembling
hands
the
anxiety
depicted
all
over
her
nervous
little
figure
could
not
but
show
carrie
that
there
was
something
serious
in
the
wind
well
she
said
i
am
awfully
sorry
i
i
just
did
it
in
a
fit
of
mischief
i
read
that
letter
which
kitty
malone
wrote
to
you
and
it
seemed
to
throw
light
on
some
of
your
actions
which
had
puzzled
me
of
late
i
went
to
your
drawer
and
found
the
money
and
thought
i
would
give
it
to
sam
to
keep
for
you
to
sam
raynes
cried
elma
backing
a
few
steps
her
voice
assuming
a
tone
of
terror
yes
do
be
careful
elma
or
you
fall
right
down
into
the
area
why
should
i
lend
it
to
sam
raynes
lend
it
well
well
it
all
the
same
i
asked
him
to
keep
it
for
me
i
go
to
him
at
once
and
get
it
said
elma
preparing
to
run
down
the
steps
carrie
caught
her
by
the
arm
i
awfully
sorry
she
said
but
it
no
use
he
he
says
we
can
not
have
it
for
a
week
perhaps
a
fortnight
he
is
doing
a
little
deal
with
it
as
he
expresses
it
he
says
perhaps
we
have
it
back
doubled
what
can
you
mean
carrie
elma
knew
nothing
whatever
about
speculation
that
which
leads
so
many
astray
had
not
yet
entered
into
her
life
you
need
not
look
so
miserable
wo
you
like
to
have
it
back
again
not
seven
pounds
but
fourteen
and
sam
says
this
will
probably
be
the
case
in
a
week
or
a
fortnight
or
at
any
rate
in
a
month
from
now
elma
threw
up
her
hand
in
despair
if
i
have
to
wait
a
month
for
the
money
she
said
i
may
as
well
never
have
it
oh
carrie
what
have
you
done
you
have
ruined
me
ruined
me
carrie
i
can
not
lead
a
low
common
life
like
yours
i
am
not
fit
for
it
oh
aunt
charlotte
will
never
do
anything
more
for
me
after
this
kitty
wants
the
money
and
i
can
not
give
it
to
her
oh
carrie
to
think
that
you
should
have
ruined
my
life
poor
elma
covered
her
face
with
her
trembling
hands
and
went
into
the
house
she
entered
the
shabby
little
and
sank
into
the
nearest
chair
carrie
stood
near
her
in
real
perplexity
and
agitation
what
a
pity
you
did
confide
in
me
when
you
brought
it
home
she
said
of
course
i
did
really
want
to
do
you
an
ill
turn
elma
but
you
were
so
sly
and
secretive
and
and
i
thought
i
would
have
my
joke
you
do
know
how
precious
dull
my
life
is
and
when
i
saw
that
letter
and
felt
that
you
were
keeping
a
nice
little
hoard
of
money
all
private
and
without
the
knowledge
of
your
sister
it
was
just
too
much
for
me
and
i
took
it
to
sam
because
i
did
know
where
to
hide
it
safe
in
this
house
the
thing
that
matters
said
elma
is
the
fact
that
i
can
not
get
it
back
but
i
must
get
it
i
must
see
sam
raynes
at
once
tell
me
why
it
is
so
bad
said
carrie
you
must
confide
the
whole
thing
to
me
now
there
no
use
in
keeping
secrets
from
your
sister
thus
adjured
and
because
she
was
almost
distracted
poor
elma
did
tell
she
described
as
well
as
she
could
the
terrible
position
she
would
be
in
at
middleton
school
if
the
whole
of
this
transaction
were
known
she
managed
to
a
certain
extent
to
open
carrie
eyes
although
i
can
not
see
what
they
would
be
so
angry
about
said
carrie
you
were
offered
the
money
and
you
accepted
it
you
never
wanted
to
keep
it
you
would
have
given
it
back
some
time
and
even
if
you
did
keep
that
irish
girl
out
of
it
for
a
month
what
would
it
have
mattered
but
there
i
see
you
are
in
a
state
and
i
am
sure
i
do
want
to
ruin
your
life
you
with
your
notions
must
not
have
all
your
ambitions
dashed
to
the
ground
we
go
together
to
see
sam
and
try
to
find
out
what
can
be
done
yes
let
us
go
at
once
said
elma
in
feverish
haste
i
wanted
to
take
the
money
to
kitty
at
present
she
can
not
tell
on
me
but
she
is
quite
certain
to
do
so
if
i
do
return
it
to
her
at
once
let
us
go
down
to
see
sam
now
all
right
answered
carrie
come
along
i
dare
say
we
find
him
at
home
i
hope
we
shall
five
minutes
later
the
girls
were
standing
outside
the
door
of
the
raynes
very
humble
dwelling
it
was
opened
by
florrie
raynes
herself
hullo
carrie
what
do
you
want
now
she
cried
oh
and
lewis
with
a
mocking
emphasis
on
the
word
miss
to
what
do
we
owe
the
honor
of
this
visit
i
want
to
see
your
brother
said
elma
brusquely
he
has
got
some
money
of
mine
which
i
must
ask
him
to
have
the
goodness
to
return
at
once
money
said
florrie
opening
her
eyes
rather
wide
well
you
can
see
him
for
yourselves
but
if
it
money
that
is
lent
to
sam
i
i
rather
pity
the
girl
who
wants
to
get
it
back
from
him
again
sam
is
a
very
whale
on
money
he
always
swallows
it
wholesale
with
these
anything
but
encouraging
words
florrie
threw
open
the
door
of
the
shabby
little
where
sam
with
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
was
lying
at
his
ease
he
started
up
when
he
saw
the
girls
removed
his
pipe
and
going
up
to
carrie
laid
his
hand
familiarly
on
her
shoulder
well
car
so
you
could
not
do
without
me
he
said
with
a
smile
the
fact
is
this
answered
elma
my
sister
has
told
me
that
she
gave
you
seven
pounds
a
couple
of
nights
ago
to
keep
for
her
that
money
happens
to
have
been
lent
to
me
and
i
want
it
back
immediately
i
have
come
for
it
will
you
give
it
to
me
please
sam
drew
in
his
breath
preparatory
to
giving
a
long
whistle
highty
tighty
he
cried
you
have
very
grand
airs
miss
elma
lewis
but
i
did
know
that
money
was
borrowed
ho
ho
this
puts
a
very
unpleasant
complexion
on
things
when
dear
old
car
brought
it
to
me
i
thought
i
might
do
what
i
liked
with
it
did
you
not
give
me
to
understand
as
much
car
here
he
gave
carrie
a
perceptible
wink
she
was
very
much
under
his
influence
and
immmediately
too
her
cue
well
yes
sam
she
answered
i
did
say
you
might
speculate
with
it
if
you
liked
of
course
you
did
my
little
girl
and
i
took
the
hint
and
did
speculate
with
it
and
a
pretty
little
deal
i
made
so
if
you
have
patience
miss
elma
you
will
get
your
money
back
doubled
then
you
will
be
able
to
return
the
principal
and
have
a
nice
little
of
your
own
now
what
do
you
say
to
that
are
you
awfully
obliged
to
me
i
say
replied
elma
that
i
want
the
money
immediately
i
can
not
wait
until
you
have
doubled
it
as
you
call
it
whatever
you
mean
by
that
please
let
me
have
it
at
once
raynes
i
must
have
it
i
i
am
afraid
you
ask
for
the
impossible
said
sam
in
a
careless
tone
i
have
speculated
with
the
money
and
the
returns
will
come
in
perhaps
in
a
week
perhaps
a
fortnight
perhaps
longer
i
say
again
that
you
ought
to
be
obliged
to
me
it
is
not
every
fellow
who
would
take
so
much
trouble
poor
elma
gave
him
a
despairing
glance
there
was
evidently
nothing
more
to
be
got
out
of
him
she
left
the
house
without
a
word
carrie
followed
her
into
the
street
oh
elma
do
look
so
miserable
said
carrie
what
is
the
good
of
sinking
into
despair
do
talk
to
me
said
elma
pushing
her
sister
hand
away
you
have
ruined
me
that
is
the
sort
of
sister
you
are
and
i
would
have
done
anything
for
you
carrie
when
i
rose
myself
and
improved
myself
in
the
social
scale
when
i
got
my
post
as
teacher
i
would
have
done
all
in
my
power
to
aid
you
and
mother
but
now
now
we
must
all
sink
together
oh
carrie
to
think
that
i
should
be
ruined
by
my
own
sister
chapter

paddy
old
coat
it
was
a
moonlit
evening
in
the
county
donegal
and
there
was
a
broad
bar
of
silver
shining
in
burnished
splendor
across
the
beautiful
lake
coulin
two
boys
were
standing
on
the
edge
of
the
lake
a
little
boat
was
lying
at
their
feet
one
the
taller
of
the
two
was
standing
with
his
hand
up
to
his
ear
listening
intently
ah
then
pat
ca
you
stop
that
shuffling
he
cried
to
his
younger
companion
i
ca
listen
if
you
keep
whistling
and
moving
your
feet
it
is
about
time
for
daneen
to
appear
kitty
is
sure
to
send
the
tinos
dear
old
girl
father
takes
care
to
keep
her
well
supplied
there
i
hear
dan
horn
he
is
coming
through
the
gap
cried
pat
his
face
lighting
up
stay
there
laurie
and
i
run
to
meet
him
just
be
at
the
other
side
of
haggart
glen
when
i
get
up
the
younger
boy
put
wings
to
his
feet
and
the
next
moment
was
out
of
sight
the
older
boy
thrusting
both
his
hands
deep
into
his
pockets
stood
staring
straight
before
him
into
the
silver
light
caused
by
a
full
moon
the
white
radiance
lit
up
his
young
person
his
pronounced
features
and
handsome
face
there
were
gloomy
depths
in
his
big
black
eyes
although
the
slightest
movement
the
faintest
play
of
expression
would
cause
them
to
dance
with
vitality
and
fun
the
petulant
expression
round
lips
curved
and
cut
with
the
delicacy
of
a
cameo
was
very
manifest
the
lad
was
built
in
almost
herculean
mould
so
broad
were
his
shoulders
so
upright
and
tall
his
young
figure
with
his
head
thrown
back
the
listening
attitude
on
his
face
his
black
hair
swept
from
his
forehead
he
looked
almost
like
a
young
god
all
was
expectancy
eagerness
in
his
attitude
if
only
kitty
is
true
it
will
be
all
right
he
muttered
ah
then
what
a
fool
i
was
when
i
allowed
the
other
fellows
to
tempt
me
to
play
that
practical
joke
on
old
i
do
think
the
governor
minds
anything
else
but
he
can
not
stand
our
making
fun
of
that
poor
old
chap
never
again
will
i
do
such
a
thing
i
would
not
have
father
know
this
matter
for
all
the
world
hullo
there
comes
pat
i
wonder
if
he
has
got
my
letter
nothing
nothing
and
worse
than
nothing
sang
out
pat
extending
two
empty
hands
as
he
approached
no
letter
for
me
cried
laurie
he
stepped
out
of
the
light
and
striding
up
to
his
brother
laid
one
of
his
big
hands
on
the
slighter
shoulder
no
letter
but
did
you
really
meet
daneen
of
course
i
did
do
grip
me
so
hard
old
chap
he
had
only
one
letter
in
his
pocket
and
that
was
for
aunt
honora
two
newspapers
for
father
and
a
heap
of
circulars
nothing
else
whatever
but
are
you
certain
sure
surely
kitty
would
not
fail
a
gossoon
when
he
was
in
trouble
i
tell
you
laurie
there
was
nothing
from
her
nor
from
any
one
except
that
one
letter
for
aunt
honora
but
perhaps
you
hear
in
the
morning
laurie
made
no
reply
his
hands
dropped
to
his
sides
the
next
moment
he
dived
into
his
trousers
pocket
and
extracted
a
few
coins
have
we
enough
for
a
telegram
i
wonder
he
said
ah
to
be
sure
why
we
can
send
one
now
for
sixpence
and
i
have
tenpence
here
i
wire

once
i
say
pat
we
must
go
to
the
nearest
post
office
and
we
will
start
now
do
you
mind
we
can
row
across
the
coulin
and
anchor
the
boat
at
the
opposite
side
and
then
it
is
only
eight
miles
across
the
mountains
to
ballyshannon
but
james
dunovan
will
have
shut
up
the
office
exclaimed
pat
and
if
we
are
absent
from

will
father
say
old
jim
knows
us
he
open
fast
enough
when

telegram
after
the
office
is

serious
business

country

go
to
the
post
office
at
once
and

the
very
first
thing
in
the
morning

young
lingering
for

waiting
and
aunt
bridget
will
make
a
fuss
you

we
are
not

at
night
bother
cried
laurie
well
then
we
must
go
home
first
what
a
nuisance
we
have
a
bite
and
then
slink
out
the
dad
can
think
we
have
gone
to
bed
why
pat
old
boy
i
met
and
he
was
like
a
mad
man
he
told
me
he
had
collected
all
that
money
for
his
funeral
what
apes
we
were
to
touch
the
coat
sure
it
unlike
kitty
not
to
write
said
pat
she
is
the
last
in
the
world
to
leave
a
fellow
in
the
lurch
do
i
know
that
who
fault
it
is
it
is
hers
poor
old
girl
something
has
happened
to
the
letter
now
pat
let
us
get
supper
over
for
we
have
no
time
to
lose
as
laurie
spoke
he
fastened
the
little
boat
securely
by
a
rope
to
a
stone
near
by
and
then
the
lads
turned
their
backs
upon
the
lake
and
strode
into
the
darkness
of
a
narrow
mountain
defile
the
path
was
steep
and
they
had
to
scramble
up
doing
so
with
the
agility
of
young
ponies
it
is
the
thought
of
that
bothers
me
entirely
said
laurie
after
a
pause
i
do
want
to
have
it
lying
on
my
soul
upon
my
honor
i
do
that
i
turned
the
poor
old
chap
brain
still
crazier
oh
the
money
will
come
along
before
saturday
said
pat
and
you
know
you
told
him
he
must
wait
until
saturday
do
you
worry
laurie
come
on
i
tell
ye
there
the
gong
sounding
at
the
castle
the
deep
notes
of
a
very
sonorous
old
gong
were
distinctly
borne
on
the
breeze
the
boys
ran
hurrying
and
panting
a
few
moments
later
they
had
climbed
an
almost
inaccessible
rock
had
tumbled
over
each
other
up
a
lawn
and
entered
a
huge
hall
where
supper
was
spread
squire
malone
was
seated
at
the
head
of
the
table
down
both
sides
were
crowded
guests
and
different
retainers
squire
malone
cousins
all
of
them
some
to
the
fifth
or
sixth
removed
miss
honora
malone
was
at
the
foot
of
the
table
and
miss
bridget
presided
at
the
tea
tray
at
one
of
the
sides
sit
down
you
lads
roared
the
squire
when
he
saw
his
sons
you
have
been
keeping
us
waiting
now
take
your
places
and
fall
to
the
boys
dropped
into
the
seats
reserved
for
them
without
a
word
they
were
hungry
and
enjoyed
the
abundant
fare
provided
miss
honora
began
to
address
them
with
a
volley
of
words
ah
then
boys
she
said
it
is
ashamed
of
you
i
am
why
should
you
come
in
to
supper
like
that
without
your
hair
brushed
or
your
hand
washed
and
looking
as
rough
as
a
pair
of
young
colts
look
at
me
now
how
neat
i
am
i
have
changed
my
dress
for
the
evening
as
she
spoke
she
glanced
at
her
thin
arms
bare
to
the
elbow
and
touched
the
gold
chain
that
encircled
her
scraggy
throat
you
never
get
dublin
manners
you
two
she
continued
and
what
will
you
do
when
you
go
into
society
ah
it
is
enough
to
break
the
heart
to
look
at
ye
laurie
winked
boldly
at
her
pat
laughed
and
helped
himself
so
some
potatoes
dennis
called
out
the
lady
addressing
her
brother
do
you
agree
with
me
that
it
is
very
bad
manners
on
the
part
of
the
boys
to
come
to
supper
without
so
much
as
washing
their
hands
or
brushing
their
hair
ought
they
not
to
put
on
evening
clothes
now
that
they
are
almost
assuming
manhood
estate
oh
leave
alone
honor
was
the
reply
boys
will
be
boys
and
castle
malone
is
liberty
hall
time
enough
a
few
years
hence
to
put
on
that
style
i
like
as
they
are
rough
diamonds
no
doubt
but
diamonds
all
the
same
the
old
man
looked
fondly
at
his
sons
he
was
a
figure
with
hair
what
will
you
do
lads
when
i
send
you
to
england
to
school
he
said
england
father
said
pat
turning
pale
it
would
kill
me
to
leave
the
soil
on
which
i
was
born
ah
now
father
i
could
not
live
through
it
and
as
to
laurie
why
he
would
laurie
you
know
what
you
would
do
oh
father
joking
said
laurie
but
his
face
went
a
little
white
and
as
he
drained
off
a
great
glass
of
water
his
hand
trembled
a
trifle
it
would
not
be
for
the
making
of
our
happiness
father
he
said
just
glancing
at
his
father
pat
is
right
it
would
about
kill
us
both
you
young
beggars
kill
you
indeed
cried
the
squire
well
i
have
not
made
my
plans
yet
i
am
thinking
of
it
and
you
may
as
well
know
it
i
have
sent
the
girleen
away
and
if
you
ca
stand
what
she
can
why
i
do
think
you
have
much
grit
in
you
as
to
pat
when
he
a
little
older
he
have
to
prepare
for
the
army
ay
and
that
a
fine
polishing
up
said
aunt
bridget
bridling
as
she
spoke
and
arranging
the
set
of
her
very
fashionable
sleeve
my
jewel
of
a
lad
you
know
what
life
is
like
then
you
think
a
deal
of
your
clothes
and
of
the
sort
of
thing
that
will
kill
the
girls
then
why
if
you
know
how
to
manage
and
with
my
help
i
dare
say
i
can
contrive
it
for
you
you
get
easily
into
the
very
height
of
dublin
society
and
be
petted
and
spoiled
and
coaxed
no
end
i
wonder
now
how
that
girleen
is
conducting
herself
sometimes
dennis
when
i
look
at
you
and
think
how
your
heart
is
wrapped
up
in
her
and
how
she
is
so
to
speak
the
jewel
of
your
eye
and
the
core
of
your
heart
i
wonder
how
you
had
the
courage
to
let
her
go
do
you
worry
me
about
it
cried
the
squire
i
did
it
for
her
good
laurie
where
are
you
off
to
i
have
had
about
enough
supper
answered
laurie
pat
also
scrambled
to
his
feet
you
are
as
a
pair
of
young
cubs
as
i
ever
came
across
cried
miss
honora
now
really
angry
why
the
syllabub
is
coming
on
soon
and
the
trifle
and
the
cream
that
i
whipped
myself
well
pat
you
have
to
mend
your
manners
when
you
get
into
the
army
and
as
to
you
laurie
you
never
be
as
good
a
squire
as
your
father
try
hard
as
you
may
a
loud
laugh
at
the
head
of
the
table
interrupted
the
good
lady
flow
of
words
honora
my
woman
you
are
talking
to
the
air
called
out
the
squire
the
boys
are
out
of
earshot
bless
ca
you
let
be
they
are
hearty
lads
and
i
do
think
i
send
either
of
them
out
of
the
country
unless
they
happen
to
displease
me
meanwhile
the
lads
had
gone
down
to
the
lake
unshipped
the
little
boat
and
were
by
this
time
half
across
the
coulin
they
soon
reached
the
opposite
shore
jumped
to
land
pulled
up
the
boat
fastened
it
and
started
along
a
long
narrow
and
mountainous
path
which
was
the
shortest
cut
to
ballyshannon
they
walked
so
quickly
and
the
hill
was
so
steep
that
they
had
little
or
no
time
for
words
nor
were
they
boys
who
talked
much
when
they
were
alone
laurie
was
given
to
his
own
meditations
pat
was
always
planning
some
scheme
which
should
circumvent
aunt
honora
who
lived
with
them
and
annoy
aunt
bridget
who
nearly
lived
with
them
although
not
quite
aunt
bridget
was
the
most
fashionable
member
of
the
family
her
real
home
was
in
dublin
she
was
the
one
who
had
worked
upon
the
squire
feelings
until
he
had
decided
to
send
kitty
to
an
english
school
pat
was
not
fond
of
either
of
his
aunts
but
he
disliked
aunt
bridget
the
most
after
an
brisk
walking
they
reached
ballyshannon
knocked
up
the
postmaster
who
had
gone
to
bed
asked
him
to
let
them
in
and
confided
to
him
what
they
wanted
he
was
a
irishman
and
was
soon
as
much
interested
in
the
telegram
which
laurie
was
to
send
as
the
boy
was
himself
you
have
heard
what
a
scrape
i
have
got
into
said
laurie
about
that
poor
mad
fellow
said
james
dunovan
yes
some
other
fellows
and
i
stole
his
coat
away
in
a
fit
of
frolic
that
day
when
we
were
out
in
the
crazy
boat
on
the
coulin
a
sudden
breeze
got
up
and
the
boat
upset
and
the
coat
bad
luck
to
it
sank
to
the
bottom
like
a
stone
we
have
tried
to
get
it
up
but
it
is
all
no
go
it
has
got
right
into
the
mud
and
not
all
the
boys
in
ireland
could
move
it
if
the
squire
heard
we
had
played
a
trick
on
he
would
just
do
what
i
do
want
him
to
and
what
may
that
be
master
laurie
why
jim
he
would
banish
me
to
england
you
think
of
that
ah
to
be
sure
sir
and
it
would
be
a
hard
punishment
entirely
and
all
for
a
boy
freak
but
how
can
you
circumvent
him
sir
that
the
puzzle
for
old
is
as
sly
a
fellow
as
walks
he
knows
his
power
with
the
squire
there
a
story
about
but
i
have
not
got
the
rights
of
it
anyhow
the
squire
is
always
trying
to
help
him
if
he
can
not
get
his
coat
in
which
he
has
hidden
all
his
money
he
will
go
raving
mad
about
the
country
and
the
squire
will
soon
get
at
the
bottom
of
the
mischief
oh
that
all
right
answered
laurie
i
saw
there
was
no
help
for
it
and
i
took
into
my
confidence
he
promised
if
i
gave
him
ten
pounds
by
saturday
next
to
let
the
matter
of
the
coat
slip
by
he
said
he
would
never
tell
i
wonder
now
if
the
craychur
is
to
be
trusted
muttered
jim
in
a
thoughtful
tone
oh
yes
he
is
jim
do
you
meet
trouble
halfway
if
once
he
gets
the
money
everything
will
be
as
right
as
possible
but
this
must
go
off
and
you
must
see
to
it
for
me
i
do
that
sir
and
welcome
the
very
moment
the
office
opens
its
doors
in
the
morning
how
soon
do
you
think
it
will
reach
my
sister
well
to
be
sure
i
expect
in
about
half
an
hour
or
an
hour
at
the
most
i
often
think
i
like
to
see
them
messages
along
the
wires
do
you
believe
as
they
go
by
the
wires
sir
oh
i
suppose
so
i
do
bother
my
head
about
it
now
then
jim
hand
us
a
form
and
we
fill
it
in
what
do
you
think
we
had
best
say
pat
make
it
strong
said
pat
yes
i
know
that
laurie
stood
biting
the
end
of
his
pencil
and
considering
the
blank
form
which
jimmy
had
provided
him
with
we
must
make
it
powerful
strong
he
said
after
a
pause
if
dad
hears
this
we
two
are
about
done
pat
he
the
easiest
old
boy
in
the
world
but
when
once
he
takes
the
bit
between
his
teeth
he
is
just
like
slieve
loon
our
new
mare
but
i
must
not
keep
you
up
jim
you
are
wanting
to
get
back
to
your
bed
it
do
matter
sir
do
you
hurry
yourself
i
told
the
wife
it
was
two
of
the
young
gentlemen
from
castle
malone
and
she
said
i
was
to
mind
how
much
time
i
spent
with
you
it
was
only
proper
respect
to
the
family
all
right
jim
now
then
pat
what
shall
i
say
hurry
up
said
pat
if
you
not
sleepy
i
am
and
the
whole
house
will
be
locked
up
if
we
are
not
quick
i
cracked
a
pane
of
glass
in
our
window
on
purpose
this
morning
said
laurie
i
thought
it
might
turn
out
convenient
pat
laughed
laurie
his
face
flushed
bent
over
the
telegraph
form
after
a
time
during
which
beads
of
perspiration
stood
out
on
his
forehead
the
following
message
was
transcribed
miss
kitty
malone
care
of
denvers
franklin
avenue
middleton
london
wake
up
old
girleen
hurry
with
the
laurie
that
the
time
of
day
he
said
you
read
it
jim
can
you
make
out
the
address
plain
yes
to
be
sure
answered
jim
very
well
sir
this
shall
go
i
am
sorry
you
in
trouble
sir
but
i
know
the
squire
sends
a
lot
of
money
to
miss
kitty
for
he
is
always
coming
here
for
postal
orders
oh
i
am
safe
to
have
it
said
laurie
well
jim
and
long
life
to
you
the
boys
left
the
office
and
retraced
their
steps
across
the
mountain
they
had
gone
about
halfway
home
when
they
were
interrupted
by
a
curious
sort
of
sound
something
between
a
croon
and
a
chant
it
came
nearer
and
nearer
and
the
next
moment
a
grotesque
figure
showed
clearly
in
the
moonlight
this
was
no
other
than
paddy
himself
he
was
a
tall
man
with
a
long
shaggy
beard
penthouse
eyebrows
and
eyes
which
were
lit
now
with
a
fitful
and
uncertain
gleam
he
was
dressed
in
rags
his
hat
was
pushed
far
back
on
his
head
his
hair
streamed
over
his
shoulders
the
savage
and
yet
creature
stopped
now
before
the
two
boys
i
say
paddy
it
is
all
right
said
laurie
going
up
to
him
and
laying
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
you
get
the
tin
i
promised
either
morning
or
the
day
after
i
have
just
sent
a
telegram
to
the
girleen
in
england
why
kitty
would
let
you
suffer
no
not
if
it
were
to
break
her
heart
a
wild
and
yet
softened
look
came
into
the
man
eyes
it
is
because
of
the
girleen
i
fretting
he
said
listen
you
two
i
feel
fit
to
die
sometimes
when
i
think
the
coat
is
lost
and
it
is
all
on
account
of
the
girleen
herself
why
it
was
she
put
in
the
last
patch
and
a
bit
of
gold
was
hidden
in
it
yes
and
she
sewed
it
round
with
her
own
pretty
hands
the
darling
we
get
back
the
coat
some
day
see
if
we
do
said
laurie
and
meanwhile
paddy
you
are
safe
to
have
your
money
on
saturday
all
right
if
i
do
said
paddy
if
not
it
is
all
wrong
i
go
to
squire
malone
yes
i
go
to
squire
malone
but
i
wait
until
saturday
i
promise
that
much
and
i
keep
my
word
you
keep
your
word
for
kitty
sake
said
laurie
the
man
nodded
again
his
eyes
softened
and
changed
in
expression
the
next
moment
he
had
turned
on
his
heel
and
was
out
of
sight
i
do
believe
the
only
person
he
cares
for
in
the
world
is
kitty
said
laurie
do
you
remember
when
he
was
so
ill
he
would
only
allow
kitty
to
visit
him
i
say
pat
we
must
get
back
that
coat
somehow
but
in
the
meantime
the
ten
pounds
will
keep
matters
quiet
chapter
xvii
we
are
both
in
the
same
boat
gwin
had
explained
all
her
points
and
miss
sherrard
had
listened
to
her
with
indulgence
sympathy
and
comprehension
they
were
seated
together
in
miss
sherrard
charming
little
i
am
glad
you
take
such
an
interest
in
kitty
she
said
when
the
girl
had
stopped
speaking
i
do
she
is
uncommon
she
is
unlike
anybody
else
said
gwin
harley
i
hope
she
added
looking
anxiously
at
the
that
you
will
feel
it
right
so
far
to
mitigate
her
punishment
as
to
allow
the
girls
to
talk
to
her
this
seems
just
the
time
for
a
society
of
this
sort
to
help
its
members
there
a
great
deal
in
what
you
say
gwin
but
all
the
same
to
my
regret
i
am
obliged
distinctly
to
refuse
your
request
gwin
face
which
had
been
slightly
flushed
now
turned
pale
she
rose
to
her
feet
do
be
hurt
with
me
dear
said
the
mistress
in
a
gentle
voice
i
admire
you
for
your
kindness
gwin
and
i
can
also
see
the
thing
from
your
point
of
view
but
all
the
same
middleton
school
is
a
very
important
one
there
are
from
six
to
seven
hundred
girls
here
most
of
these
girls
have
got
parents
all
have
got
guardians
and
friends
it
would
not
do
for
them
to
know
that
such
a
wild
and
reckless
act
as
kitty
malone
has
perpetrated
should
be
passed
over
without
a
severe
punishment
kitty
will
live
through
this
week
of
isolation
and
be
all
the
better
for
it
at
the
end
of
that
time
you
girls
can
do
all
in
your
power
to
help
her
for
this
one
week
i
must
insist
on
her
living
in
coventry
she
will
do
her
lessons
of
course
for
it
would
not
be
at
all
wise
to
give
her
a
holiday
but
no
girl
belonging
to
the
school
with
the
exception
of
alice
must
speak
to
her
i
am
sorry
and
you
will
forgive
me
for
saying
without
any
disrespect
to
you
that
i
think
you
are
wrong
answered
gwin
she
now
held
out
her
hand
to
miss
sherrard
miss
sherrard
took
it
and
pressed
it
gently
you
are
a
very
good
girl
gwin
and
i
wish
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
that
i
could
grant
your
request
meanwhile
kitty
had
returned
to
the
denvers
house
in
a
whirl
of
passionate
protest
and
indignation
she
could
not
understand
why
she
had
been
punished
the
sin
she
had
committed
did
not
seem
to
be
any
sin
at
all
to
her
what
did
it
matter
how
she
dressed
or
when
she
went
out
the
fact
that
she
had
broken
a
very
strict
rule
of
middleton
school
did
not
affect
her
she
was
now
seriously
unhappy
the
fetters
with
which
she
was
surrounded
tortured
her
how
could
she
live
through
the
terrible
week
of
isolation
and
what
made
her
more
wretched
than
anything
else
was
the
fact
that
she
could
not
see
elma
in
order
to
get
the
money
from
her
to
send
to
laurie
kitty
and
laurie
had
always
been
more
than
ordinary
friends
the
thoughts
of
each
were
known
to
the
heart
of
the
other
if
there
was
one
person
in
the
wide
world
whom
kitty
loved
with
passion
almost
with
idolatry
it
was
her
handsome
brother
laurie
the
bare
idea
that
laurie
should
plead
to
kitty
to
help
him
and
that
kitty
would
be
obliged
to
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
his
entreaties
was
enough
to
madden
the
reckless
girl
the
whole
of
that
afternoon
she
spent
in
her
bedroom
pacing
up
and
down
like
a
young
caged
tiger
denvers
went
to
talk
to
her
but
kitty
would
not
speak
she
would
pour
out
her
troubles
to
no
one
her
proud
irish
heart
felt
as
if
it
would
burst
from
misery
but
she
would
not
stoop
to
the
sympathy
of
those
who
she
felt
could
not
possibly
understand
her
of
all
the
denver
family
she
liked
fred
the
best
and
when
he
ventured
to
knock
at
her
door
in
the
course
of
the
evening
she
did
not
refuse
to
open
it
to
him
come
along
downstairs
at
once
kitty
said
fred
holding
out
his
hand
to
her
i
would
rather
stay
where
i
am
fred
asthore
i
say
it
a
beastly
shame
to
have
you
treated
like
this
oh
do
begin
to
sympathize
with
me
said
kitty
if
you
do
cry
the
ocean
full
of
tears
i
am
holding
them
back
hard
now
you
know
what
a
thing
it
is
when
an
irish
girl
fairly
gives
way
well
they
beastly
hard
on
you
but
i
sure
i
would
not
cry
if
i
were
you
said
fred
i
just
be
too
proud
but
come
downstairs
to
my
den
kitty
i
have
made
it
awfully
comfortable
your
den
said
kitty
her
eyes
lighting
up
have
you
got
one
yes
it
not
in
the
house
it
in
the
garden
at
the
further
end
it
a
shed
but
i
have
made
it
waterproof
and
i
have
got
a
little
lamp
an
oil
one
and
we
can
sit
there
and
have
a
jolly
talk
for
a
moment
kitty
eyes
sparkled
with
renewed
hope
and
i
have
still
got
some
chocolates
in
my
drawer
she
exclaimed
we
might
eat
them
together
and
have
a
real
good
time
but
oh
that
money
it
the
money
that
bothering
me
entirely
oh
dear
dear
i
let
the
whole
thing
out
if
i
talk
any
more
to
you
fred
fred
it
the
true
comfort
you
are
to
me
and
i
never
forget
it
to
the
longest
day
i
live
but
i
go
to
that
shed
with
you
gossoon
asthore
for
if
i
did
i
let
out
everything
but
why
should
you
let
out
everything
said
fred
something
bothering
you
and
you
keeping
it
all
to
yourself
but
i
promised
i
would
tell
and
i
do
want
to
break
my
word
i
said
when
she
asked
me
i
ca
keep
secrets
but
then
it
was
put
in
such
a
way
that
i
must
keep
it
i
ca
go
with
you
fred
pray
ask
me
again
to
you
and
thank
you
thank
you
kitty
ran
into
her
room
shut
the
door
locked
it
and
retreated
to
the
window
to
be
as
far
as
possible
from
fred
insinuating
voice
and
ways
and
denvers
were
out
again
that
night
and
the
time
dragged
terribly
kitty
wondered
how
she
was
to
live
through
a
whole
week
of
this
torture
i
promised
elma
that
i
would
not
tell
about
her
asking
me
for
that
money
she
said
to
herself
i
wish
i
had
said
so
now
but
she
seemed
so
earnest
and
i
really
thought
nothing
of
it
at
the
time
oh
dear
dear
i
wonder
she
does
not
bring
it
to
me
she
must
be
the
meanest
of
the
mean
i
never
liked
her
but
now
i
hate
her
poor
poor
dear
old
do
i
know
what
he
is
feeling
and
what
laurie
is
feeling
my
broth
of
a
boy
my
laurie
asthore
oh
to
think
that
he
is
in
trouble
and
i
ca
help
him
how
i
wish
i
was
back
in
ireland
now
this
will
break
my
heart
it
will
break
my
heart
tears
filled
her
eyes
but
she
was
too
proud
to
let
them
roll
over
i
will
keep
them
back
if
i
die
for
it
she
said
to
herself
i
am
kitty
malone
and
they
will
break
my
heart
if
this
goes
on
but
i
cry
no
that
i
wo
while
these
thoughts
were
coursing
through
the
poor
girl
brain
there
came
another
knock
at
the
door
an
insistent
and
somewhat
fierce
one
this
time
the
handle
was
sharply
turned
and
the
clear
voice
of
alice
was
heard
open
the
door
at
once
please
kitty
she
said
kitty
crossed
the
room
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
and
allowed
alice
to
enter
i
must
beg
of
you
kitty
said
alice
not
to
lock
the
door
again
and
why
not
pray
you
locked
it
last
night
it
was
on
account
of
that
i
am
now
in
all
this
trouble
really
kitty
you
are
quite
too
ridiculous
as
if
i
were
the
cause
of
your
trouble
you
are
in
trouble
because
you
disobeyed
a
strict
rule
and
my
locking
the
door
or
not
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
it
you
are
quite
the
most
tiresome
inconsistent
girl
i
ever
came
across
well
it
is
nothing
to
you
what
i
am
said
kitty
she
sank
down
on
a
chair
by
the
side
of
her
little
bed
as
she
spoke
her
expression
was
so
her
face
so
pale
the
droop
of
her
eyes
so
pathetic
that
alice
was
slightly
touched
in
spite
of
herself
i
am
going
to
see
bessie
challoner
she
said
if
you
were
different
i
would
not
leave
you
oh
never
mind
me
pray
all
the
same
i
would
not
leave
you
kitty
for
remember
i
am
the
only
girl
belonging
to
the
school
who
may
speak
to
you
for
the
next
week
but
really
your
ways
are
so
unpleasant
and
i
so
infinitely
prefer
your
absence
to
your
company
retorted
kitty
so
you
may
go
with
quite
an
easy
mind
thanks
awfully
replied
alice
with
a
sneer
her
momentary
had
dried
up
like
the
dew
she
put
on
her
hat
wrapped
a
shawl
round
her
shoulders
and
left
the
room
kitty
returned
to
her
place
by
the
window
it
was
now
between
eight
and
nine
she
had
refused
both
dinner
and
tea
and
was
in
consequence
feeling
weak
and
faint
there
was
a
giddy
sensation
in
her
head
to
which
she
was
not
accustomed
she
did
not
connect
it
with
the
fact
that
she
was
starving
and
wondered
what
was
the
matter
with
her
she
was
too
excited
and
wretched
to
feel
her
ordinary
appetite
she
had
gone
through
a
great
deal
and
her
nerves
were
reminding
her
of
the
cruel
trick
she
was
playing
on
them
it
was
very
dull
in
her
room
the
gas
jet
shed
a
hideous
glare
over
the
place
the
room
in
itself
was
by
no
means
pretty
for
the
paper
was
the
worse
for
wear
and
the
paint
was
nearly
worn
through
to
the
woodwork
the
hangings
to
the
windows
and
to
the
two
little
beds
were
of
an
ugly
drab
color
and
the
view
out
of
these
windows
only
revealed
a
narrow
street
at
kitty
own
home
she
had
a
bedroom
in
the
castle
end
the
paper
hung
in
ribbons
the
door
was
draughty
the
bedstead
rickety
and
old
but
what
a
view
there
was
from
the
windows
a
view
of
lake
coulin
and
the
mountains
in
the
distance
and
the
park
lying
verdant
and
green
between
the
lake
and
the
house
what
a
breeze
blew
in
at
those
windows
oh
i
should
never
be
dull
if
i
were
locked
up
in
the
dear
old
bedroom
at
home
thought
the
girl
but
here
here
it
is
enough
to
madden
one
and
yet
i
must
stay
here
for
i
can
not
talk
to
the
others
i
will
not
allow
fred
to
guess
my
secret
oh
what
a
miserable
unhappy
wretched
girl
i
am
i
am
a
prisoner
oh
if
only
laurie
saw
me
dear
laurie
the
darling
the
treasure
that
he
is
it
would
break
his
heart
if
he
knew
what
i
am
suffering
there
were
no
books
at
all
interesting
to
kitty
in
the
room
so
she
could
not
while
away
the
lagging
hours
with
a
novel
as
a
rule
the
arranging
of
her
wardrobe
the
trying
on
of
her
many
dresses
gave
her
pleasant
occupation
but
she
was
in
no
humor
to
make
herself
smart
that
evening
i
suppose
the
love
of
dress
is
a
sin
she
said
to
herself
although
it
is
one
of
the
rules
of
the
society
that
the
girls
are
to
be
fashionably
dressed
anyhow
it
seems
to
have
been
my
undoing
for
if
i
had
only
gone
out
in
somber
ugly
attire
last
night
i
might
have
the
money
now
for
my
darling
laurie
and
this
heavy
heavy
weight
would
be
off
my
mind
and
i
should
not
be
in
disgrace
at
middleton
school
not
that
that
much
matters
she
went
to
the
window
flung
it
open
and
looked
out
it
was
a
clear
starlit
night
she
could
see
the
sky
from
between
the
long
rows
of
houses
she
looked
up
at
it
and
then
put
in
her
head
again
i
shall
suffocate
if
i
stay
any
longer
in
this
room
she
said
to
herself
after
all
why
should
i
obey
miss
sherrard
she
spoke
about
my
word
of
honor
but
i
have
not
given
it
i
was
silent
i
was
silent
on
purpose
if
i
could
only
see
elma
and
get
my
money
back
all
would
be
right
and
i
could
really
bear
the
rest
of
this
terrible
week
i
have
a
great
mind
to
risk
it
and
go
to
her
no
sooner
had
the
thought
entered
the
head
of
the
wayward
girl
than
she
proceeded
to
act
upon
it
she
put
on
a
long
cloak
which
reached
nearly
to
her
feet
a
little
cap
of
blue
cloth
was
secured
over
her
mass
of
curling
hair
and
then
going
cautiously
across
the
room
she
took
the
key
out
of
the
lock
unfastened
the
door
shut
it
behind
her
locked
it
from
the
outside
put
the
key
in
her
pocket
and
ran
downstairs
if
the
servants
or
alice
come
up
they
will
think
i
have
gone
to
bed
what
fun
if
i
keep
alice
out
of
her
bed
for
an
hour
or
two
laughed
kitty
she
was
now
once
more
in
high
excitement
and
pleasure
it
never
took
long
to
raise
her
volatile
spirits
i
hope
fred
wo
be
about
i
do
want
to
get
the
poor
darling
into
mischief
she
said
to
herself
there
was
no
one
in
sight
however
the
younger
children
were
away
in
another
part
of
the
house
and
denvers
were
out
the
servants
were
in
the
kitchen
alice
was
with
bessie
challoner
and
fred
was
down
in
his
shed
mourning
the
absence
of
kitty
whose
bright
ways
were
fascinating
him
more
and
more
it
all
right
thought
the
girl
she
left
the
house
and
a
few
moments
later
was
walking
at
a
rapid
pace
in
the
direction
of
constantine
road
the
thought
of
her
disobedience
of
the
daring
of
her
own
act
but
added
zest
and
pleasure
to
her
walk
how
happy
i
shall
be
when
i
get
the
money
she
said
to
herself
coax
fred
or
denvers
to
get
me
a
postal
order
and
send
it
to
laurie
at
once
oh
what
a
weight
will
be
off
my
mind
why
i
almost
feel
inclined
to
turn
good
again
the
walk
to
constantine
road
was
a
long
one
and
kitty
on
this
occasion
was
determined
to
avoid
the
neighborhood
of
the
spotted
leopard
in
preference
she
took
the
short
cut
across
the
common
it
was
very
lonely
here
but
she
had
no
fear
of
ghosts
or
bogies
she
walked
with
her
upright
young
carriage
her
quick
alert
dancing
step
it
was
ten
however
before
she
reached
constantine
road
she
ran
up
the
steps
of
no
and
rang
the
bell
the
door
was
opened
to
her
by
the
servant
maggie
oh
miss
malone
cried
that
young
woman
is
that
yourself
miss
i
has
got
into
the
most
terrible
trouble
maggie
face
was
flushed
and
blistered
with
crying
they
has
took
away
my
wiolets
miss
and
i
call
it
a
bitter
cruel
shame
never
mind
that
now
maggie
answered
kitty
i
want
to
see
miss
elma
is
she
in
that
she
is
miss
and
she
sha
escape
you
this
time
come
right
into
the
parlor
and
i
send
her
down
to
you
kitty
danced
into
the
house
as
far
as
her
appearance
now
went
she
had
never
known
a
sorrow
nor
a
care
in
her
life
she
stood
in
the
center
of
the
room
waiting
impatiently
for
elma
to
appear
maggie
having
shut
her
in
went
cautiously
upstairs
elma
and
carrie
were
in
their
bedroom
carrie
was
already
in
bed
maggie
who
seemed
to
scent
mischief
all
round
thought
she
would
now
act
with
considerable
guile
she
knocked
a
low
and
gentle
knock
on
the
panel
of
the
door
elma
came
to
open
it
what
is
it
maggie
miss
helma
will
you
come
outside
on
the
landing
for
a
minute
elma
went
out
i
have
a
bit
of
news
about
that
money
miss
if
you
come
right
down
to
the
i
tell
you
there
news
about
my
money
maggie
oh
impossible
but
hope
ever
ready
to
dawn
in
the
human
breast
could
not
help
rising
now
on
poor
horizon
it
all
seemed
utterly
impossible
but
what
earthly
sense
would
there
be
in
maggie
telling
a
lie
i
was
just
getting
into
bed
she
said
ca
you
tell
me
here
no
miss
it
not
me
at
all
it
news
of
the
money

if
you

and
be
quick
about
it
well

as
well
go
is
there

go
and
find
out
miss

elma
sam
raynes

repented

able
to
find

all
and

to
me
this
is
nice
what
the
matter
elma
called
carrie
from
her
bed
nothing

be
back
in
a
few
moments
elma
hastily
refastened
her
dress
put
up
her
hands
to
her
hair
to
smooth
it
and
tripped
downstairs
full
of
expectation
and
hope
maggie
had
relit
the
gas
in
the
elma
bounded
into
the
room
well
sam
she
exclaimed
then
she
stepped
back
a
couple
of
paces
she
was
confronted
not
by
sam
but
by
kitty
malone
herself
kitty
cried
elma
there
was
a
faintness
in
her
voice
which
kitty
had
no
time
to
remark
yes

i
have
come
i
have
broken
my
word
of
honor
but
after
all
i

and
i
am
unable
to
explain
laurie

have
the
money
he

me
to
help
him
about
something
and
i
must
send
it
to

said
elma
i
would
do
anything
in
all
the
world
to
let
you
have
it
back
but
it
is
my
fault
what
did
you
spend
it
on
dress
oh
in
different
ways
elma
had
made
up
her
mind
not
to
tell
about
carrie
and
sam
raynes
i
let
her
think
that
i
spent
the
money
on
finery
she
said
to
herself
she
is
sympathizing
about
dress
i
let
her
think
that
kitty
hands
had
dropped
to
her
sides
a
look
of
despair
filled
her
face
what
is
to
be
done
she
said
i
never
thought
for
a
moment
you
could
not
let
me
have
it
back
you
shall
have
it
in
a
week
that
i
promise
you
faithfully
but
a
week
will
be
no
good
elma
oh
elma
elma
laurie
will
suffer
for
this
they
will
take
his
freedom
from
him
he
will
be
like
a
chained
lion
he
will
lose
his
spirit
perhaps
perhaps
he
will
die
i
can
not
stand
it
elma
i
can
not
kitty
covered
her
face
with
both
her
hands
and
the
tears
which
with
difficulty
she
had
been
keeping
back
all
the
evening
burst
forth
in
torrents
kitty
did
not
cry
as
an
english
girl
might
she
cried
with
the
wild
passionate
sobs
of
those
who
have
seldom
exercised
elma
was
dreadfully
frightened
do
stop
kitty
she
said
you
make
so
much
noise
mother
and
carrie
will
hear
you
carrie
will
come
down
what
if
she
does
cried
kitty
oh
laurie
laurie
this
will
break
your
heart
you
are
ruined
ruined
for
life
there
are
more
than
laurie
ruined
for
life
it
seems
to
me
said
elma
kitty
i
am
ever
so
sorry
but
if
you
will
only
be
patient
i
will
try
and
think
of
some
plan
of
helping
you
now
please
please
promise
me
one
thing
you
wo
tell
that
i
asked
you
for
this
money
why
not
i
must
tell
some
one
i
must
get
the
money
somehow
but
you
made
me
a
promise
you
would
not
tell
it
is
very
wrong
to
break
a
promise
i
do
care
whether
it
is
right
or
wrong
i
can
not
keep
this
secret
elma
i
must
remember
laurie
perhaps
denvers
will
lend
me
the
money
i
must
think
of
laurie
first
please
kitty
listen
to
me
if
you
will
promise
to
keep
my
secret
manage
to
get
you
the
money
somehow
but
how
elma
oh
i
think
out
some
plan
do
promise
me
that
you
keep
my
secret
it
would
be
my
ruin
if
it
were
known
do
promise
kitty
do
please
i
can
not
said
kitty
she
walked
restlessly
to
the
door
i
must
go
she
said
if
i
do
they
will
discover
that
i
am
out
and
if
they
do
you
get
into
an
awful
scrape
oh
it
does
matter
i
ca
be
worse
off
than
i
am
my
one
hope
now
is
that
they
will
expel
me
then
i
have
to
return
to
ireland
and
perhaps
i
may
coax
father
not
to
be
too
hard
on
laurie
then
kitty
you
have
quite
made
up
your
mind
to
tell
all
about
me
i
think
so
i
can
not
imagine
why
it
matters
but
it
does
and
i
must
give
you
the
reason
i
did
wrong
dreadfully
wrong
ever
to
ask
you
for
that
money
i
broke
one
of
the
strictest
rules
of
the
school
what
do
you
mean
it
is
one
of
the
strictest
rules
of
middleton
school
that
no
schoolgirl
must
ask
another
to
lend
her
money
the
governors
are
terribly
particular
if
it
is
ever
known
i
shall
be
most
likely
expelled
anyhow
my
character
will
be
gone
and
i
shall
be
ruined
for
life
oh
kitty
you
have
not
such
a
hard
life
as
i
have
do
have
pity
on
me
kitty
stood
silent
she
was
thinking
deeply
you
promise
wo
you
repeated
elma
i
ca
say
i
scarcely
know
what
i
am
doing
at
the
present
moment
then
listen
to
me
if
you
tell
about
the
money
i
tell
about
this
visit
there
do
you
see
now
we
are
quits
you
tell
that
would
be
mean
of
you
yes
i
tell
that
you
broke
your
parole
but
i
never
gave
it
oh
that
is
only
begging
the
question
kitty
miss
sherrard
understood
that
you
had
given
it
when
you
came
here
you
broke
it
you
get
into
a
terrible
scrape
and
you
spoke
to
me
elma
so
you
too
will
get
into
a
scrape
kitty
tears
stopped
like
summer
rain
and
a
flash
of
sunshine
flew
across
her
charming
face
poor
elma
you
will
be
in
hot
water
too
she
said
what
a
muddle
everything
is
in
you
see
kitty
we
must
cling
together
for
we
are
both
in
the
same
boat
i
do
my
utmost
to
get
you
that
money
i
am
sure
i
can
manage
somehow
but
you
must
not
tell
all
right
i
keep
the
secret
until
after
school
elma
she
left
the
house
and
elma
returned
to
carrie
who
were
you
talking
to
all
that
time
exclaimed
carrie
that
unfortunate
girl
kitty
malone
you
mean
to
say
she
was
here
yes
she
came
about
the
money
i
am
miserable
about
it
i
promised
to
get
it
for
her
by
hook
or
by
crook
how
can
i
manage
look
here
said
carrie
after
a
pause
during
which
she
was
sitting
up
in
bed
and
thinking
intently
you
say
that
kitty
malone
is
very
rich
yes
of
course
she
is
she
has
more
money
than
she
knows
what
to
do
with
why
i
tell
you
carrie
the
day
she
lent
me
those
eight
sovereigns
i
saw
fifteen
in
her
purse
fancy
a
girl
having
fifteen
sovereigns
just
to
do
what
she
liked
with
i
could
scarcely
realize
it
i
took
the
money
before
i
knew
what
i
was
doing
she
did
tempt
me
so
sorely
when
she
showed
me
her
purse
oh
i
not
a
bit
surprised
said
carrie
if
i
had
been
in
your
shoes
i
have
taken
the
whole
fifteen
sovereigns
just
as
soon
as
the
eight
but
listen
to
me
elma
i
have
a
plan
in
my
head
i
talk
it
over
with
sam
perhaps
we
can
get
the
money
but
there
no
saying
i
talk
it
over
with
sam
i
wish
you
would
not
i
would
rather
not
get
it
through
his
means
what
a
dislike
you
have
to
him
i
have
he
is
not
good
enough
for
you
carrie
oh
carrie
dear
i
vow
and
declare
that
i
work
for
you
and
mother
i
work
my
very
fingers
to
the
bone
i
do
anything
for
you
only
do
marry
that
horrid
fellow
how
excitable
you
are
elma
and
queer
sam
suits
me
very
well
oh
if
you
do
want
his
help
you
need
not
have
it
remember
it
is
your
scrape
not
mine
it
is
your
scrape
too
carrie
you
stole
the
money
and
gave
it
to
sam
raynes
you
are
a
thief
and
you
have
ruined
your
sister
if
you
begin
abusing
me
i
shall
certainly
not
stay
awake
any
longer
said
carrie
i
dead
with
sleep
as
it
is
now
do
put
out
the
candle
like
a
good
girl
i
off
to
the
land
of
nod
carrie
pulled
the
clothes
over
her
head
and
struggled
down
among
the
pillows
elma
stood
and
stared
out
of
the
window
i
wonder
if
i
could
do
it
she
said
at
last
to
herself
it
might
be
the
best
plan
and
gwin
is
very
kind
and
very
rich
i
wonder
if
i
dare
anything
seems
better
than
my
present
predicament
chapter
xviii
i
can
not
help
you
elma
scarcely
slept
that
night
at
an
early
hour
on
the
following
brilliant
summer
morning
she
stole
softly
out
of
bed
glanced
for
a
moment
at
carrie
as
she
lay
sleeping
the
sleep
of
the
just
with
her
towzled
hair
tossed
about
the
pillow
and
then
getting
deftly
into
her
own
clothes
left
the
room
without
arousing
the
sleeper
she
had
made
up
her
mind
very
definitely
what
to
do
without
even
waiting
to
get
any
breakfast
she
unfastened
the
hall
door
opened
it
and
stepped
out
into
the
full
radiance
of
the
summer
morning
a
quick
walk
brought
her
in
a
little
over
half
an
hour
to
harley
grove
when
she
went
up
the
ponderous
flight
of
steps
which
led
to
the
principal
door
of
the
mansion
a
clock
far
away
struck
the
hour
of
seven
it
is
terribly
early
she
said
to
herself
terribly
early
to
disturb
her
but
it
is
my
only
chance
i
must
have
time
i
can
not
rush
this
thing
if
she
can
help
me
i
believe
she
will
and
anyhow
i
do
no
harm
by
what
i
intend
to
say
to
her
elma
rang
the
bell
but
her
early
summons
was
not
immediately
attended
to
presently
a
servant
girl
who
looked
as
if
she
might
be
one
of
the
unbolted
and
unbarred
the
door
and
opened
it
a
few
inches
when
she
saw
a
girl
in
all
probability
a
schoolgirl
standing
outside
she
opened
it
a
little
further
and
her
jaw
dropped
in
some
astonishment
i
have
come
here
said
elma
to
know
if
i
can
see
miss
harley
immediately
on
very
special
business
i
do
know
miss
i
am
sure
answered
the
girl
who
was
a
stranger
in
those
parts
i
ca
say
that
you
can
see
miss
harley
now
for
i
think
she
is
fast
asleep
and
in
bed
miss
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
or
i
would
not
disturb
her
said
elma
i
have
brought
a
note
with
me
can
you
manage
in
some
way
to
have
it
delivered
to
her
i
can
wait
downstairs
in
any
of
the
rooms
until
i
get
her
answer
as
elma
spoke
she
slipped
a
little
note
into
the
hand
at
the
same
time
placing
in
it
one
of
her
own
most
valuable
and
very
few
and
far
between
shillings
can
you
manage
it
for
me
she
said
it
is
really
of
the
utmost
importance
a
shilling
was
a
small
bribe
but
the
housemaid
was
young
and
she
looked
again
once
or
twice
at
elma
who
could
wear
a
most
pleasing
expression
when
she
chose
and
then
ushering
her
into
a
small
room
to
the
left
of
the
wide
entrance
hall
departed
slowly
upstairs
on
her
errand
while
she
was
away
elma
fidgeted
walking
from
end
to
end
of
the
little
room
into
which
she
had
been
admitted
all
depended
or
so
she
imagined
on
her
note
reaching
its
destination
she
knew
gwin
kind
heart
she
was
certain
that
if
gwin
received
the
note
however
tired
and
sleepy
she
was
she
would
at
least
see
her
for
a
few
minutes
elma
had
worded
it
craftily
i
am
in
great
trouble
she
had
written
it
is
connected
with
kitty
malone
i
see
my
way
to
helping
kitty
if
you
gwin
can
help
me
but
i
must
see
you
now
at
once
let
me
come
to
your
bedroom
i
would
not
disturb
you
if
it
were
not
a
matter
of
life
or
death
this
note
sufficiently
startling
in
its
contents
was
given
by
the
to
gwin
own
special
maid
the
girl
after
some
deliberation
said
she
would
venture
to
give
it
to
gwin
early
as
the
hour
was
accordingly
she
stole
into
the
shaded
bedroom
drew
up
one
of
the
blinds
and
when
gwin
opened
her
sleepy
eyes
presented
her
with
the
little
note
on
a
salver
there
a
young
lady
a
miss
lewis
waiting
downstairs
she
brought
this
note
and
begged
that
it
should
be
delivered
to
you
at
once
miss
i
ventured
under
the
circumstances
to
wake
you
as
the
young
lady
seemed
from
all
accounts
to
be
in
a
desperate
way
what
can
it
mean
said
gwin
she
sprang
up
in
bed
tore
open
the
note
and
read
the
contents
is
my
cold
bath
in
the
room
simpson
she
asked
of
her
maid
yes
miss
in
your
well
i
shall
dress
at
once
go
down
please
to
miss
lewis
and
tell
her
that
i
be
ready
to
see
her
in
my
study
in
twenty
minutes
the
maid
departed
on
this
errand
which
brought
much
relief
to
poor
elma
in
less
than
the
time
named
she
was
summoned
by
gwin
maid
to
come
with
her
to
miss
harley
study
there
a
moment
later
she
and
gwin
were
clasping
each
other
hands
gwin
was
in
a
long
white
her
hair
streaming
over
her
shoulders
well
to
be
sure
elma
she
exclaimed
you
are
an
early
bird
now
what
do
you
want
with
me
i
am
full
of
curiosity
you
are
in
trouble
and
it
is
something
connected
with
kitty
malone
yes
said
elma
i
am
desperate
and
i
have
come
on
a
desperate
errand
gwin
can
you
manage
somehow
or
other
in
some
fashion
to
let
me
have
the
use
of
eight
pounds
for
for
say
a
fortnight
gwin
harley
gasped
not
only
at
the
magnitude
of
the
sum
demanded
but
also
at
elma
audacity
in
asking
for
it
you
want
eight
pounds
she
exclaimed
but
elma
you
know
the
rule
oh
yes
i
know
the
rule
and
it
is
because
i
am
fairly
desperate
i
apply
to
you
you
might
lend
the
money
to
my
sister
carrie
or
perhaps
mother
would
be
best
it
might
be
managed
so
that
i
did
appear
to
borrow
it
i
would
not
ask
for
it
if
if
the
trouble
were
not
terrible
and
and
the
secret
belongs
to
another
what
do
you
mean
it
belongs
partly
to
kitty
malone
i
can
not
help
you
said
gwin
decidedly
why
oh
gwin
i
did
not
know
you
could
be
so
cruel
you
do
understand
elma
i
am
surprised
that
you
should
ask
me
how
could
i
break
one
of
the
strictest
rules
of
the
school
oh
but
you
need
not
really
break
it
i
mean
it
could
be
managed
in
this
way
would
not
your
father
lend
mother
the
money
you
need
not
do
it
at
all
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
ask
him
you
must
tell
me
everything
elma
this
is
most
mysterious
why
do
you
want
money
is
it
for
yourself
you
must
tell
me
every
single
thing
i
can
not
tell
you
because
the
secret
is
not
mine
you
say
kitty
is
mixed
up
with
this
yes
yes
and
you
will
not
tell
why
i
can
not
i
wish
i
could
then
elma
i
also
must
be
firm
i
can
not
help
you
you
will
not
ask
your
father
how
could
i
it
would
be
a
subterfuge
the
whole
thing
would
be
a
subterfuge
i
must
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
i
am
sorry
elma
for
i
see
you
are
in
great
trouble
but
i
am
powerless
then
i
am
ruined
said
elma
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
the
tears
trickled
slowly
between
her
fingers
i
wish
i
could
help
you
said
gwin
kindly
is
there
any
other
way
no
other
way
i
want
eight
pounds
for
a
fortnight
i
want
it
desperately
you
could
manage
to
let
me
have
it
without
breaking
the
rules
of
the
school
but
you
will
not
i
am
truly
sorry
but
i
will
not
oh
gwin
if
you
would
only
trust
me
we
were
always
friends
were
we
not
yes
answered
gwin
slowly
i
have
always
liked
you
elma
we
were
friends
continued
elma
wiping
the
tears
passionately
from
her
cheeks
and
i
did
think
last
night
when
i
was
in
such
trouble
that
perhaps
you
could
come
to
my
aid
i
thought
you
would
trust
me
without
my
telling
you
everything
i
can
not
elma
said
gwin
again
why
elma
now
looked
steadily
into
gwin
face
gwin
looked
gravely
into
hers
after
a
time
gwin
spoke
slowly
because
she
said
forgive
me
elma
you
are
not
trustworthy
oh
said
elma
she
turned
first
pale
and
then
red
there
is
no
use
in
my
staying
she
said
after
a
pause
i
am
sorry
i
got
you
up
so
early
oh
that
does
not
matter
said
gwin
in
an
altered
tone
i
would
do
what
i
could
to
help
you
but
i
can
not
do
the
impossible
i
see
that
i
was
mistaken
in
you
not
at
all
replied
gwin
you
found
me
what
i
have
always
been
i
am
naturally
careful
i
never
jump
to
wild
conclusions
i
am
not
impulsive
i
have
liked
you
and
i
shall
go
on
liking
you
in
the
future
even
though
i
am
not
trustworthy
yes
i
shall
like
you
for
what
you
are
you
have
always
been
nice
to
me
and
i
wish
to
be
nice
to
you
please
understand
that
this
will
make
no
difference
and
you
wo
tell
what
i
came
about
no
i
shall
never
mention
it
now
must
you
go
i
must
said
elma
the
full
morning
light
fell
upon
her
face
as
she
spoke
and
gwin
noticed
that
it
looked
small
pinched
and
thin
you
must
have
some
breakfast
first
she
said
she
walked
across
the
room
and
sounded
the
bell
the
servant
appeared
in
a
moment
order
breakfast
to
be
served
here
this
morning
said
miss
harley
for
two
please
the
maid
withdrew
gwin
opened
the
window
and
looked
out
i
am
very
sorry
for
kitty
she
said
after
a
pause
elma
did
not
reply
after
a
time
she
said
slowly
did
you
see
miss
sherrard
last
night
i
did
but
it
was
useless
she
wo
retract
her
mandate
a
sigh
of
relief
came
from
elma
lips
the
servant
again
appeared
with
breakfast
gwin
poured
out
tea
for
her
friend
elma
drank
a
cup
her
throat
felt
dry
she
saw
no
way
out
of
her
difficulty
she
could
scarcely
bring
herself
to
eat
a
few
moments
later
she
was
on
her
way
back
from
harley
grove
she
hesitated
whether
to
go
straight
to
the
school
and
wait
there
until
nine
or
to
return
to
constantine
road
after
a
little
reflection
she
decided
on
the
latter
course
she
reached
home
hot
and
weary
between
eight
and
nine
carrie
was
seated
at
the
breakfast
table
a
letter
lay
on
elma
plate
why
elma
what
have
you
been
doing
out
and
about
at
this
unearthly
hour
said
carrie
as
she
cracked
the
shell
of
an
egg
by
no
means
fresh
where
is
mother
remarked
elma
as
she
seated
herself
at
the
table
she
has
a
bad
headache
i
have
sent
up
her
breakfast
are
you
going
to
see
her
no
i
think
not
i
shall
just
have
time
to
eat
something
not
that
i
am
specially
hungry
and
then
start
for
school
there
a
letter
on
your
plate
why
do
you
read
it
i
know
it
from
aunt
charlotte
well
well
and
you
are
interested
in
aunt
charlotte
more
than
i
am
said
carrie
do
read
your
letter
elma
somewhat
languidly
tore
open
the
envelope
the
next
moment
she
uttered
an
exclamation
and
her
face
went
first
red
and
then
pale
aunt
charlotte
writes
to
say
she
is
coming
here
good
gracious
said
carrie
she
does
want
me
to
stay
in
does
she
oh
no
but
this
is
terribly
awkward
why
so
elma
why
should
you
ask
her
to
lend
you
the
money
ask
aunt
charlotte
i
may
as
well
put
my
hand
into
the
fire
well
suppose
i
were
to
help
you
said
carrie
after
a
time
you
carrie
how
could
you
but
suppose
i
were
to
i
am
not
the
sort
of
person
who
does
anything
for
nothing
what
would
you
give
me
if
i
got
you
out
of
this
but
how
could
you
get
me
out
of
it
why
i
suppose
by
giving
kitty
the
money
carrie
you
talk
nonsense
unless
indeed
you
were
to
persuade
sam
raynes
oh
it
useless
to
worry
poor
sam
he
has
speculated
with
that
money
and
if
he
doubles
it
we
shall
have
it
back
i
think
when
that
time
comes
the
very
least
you
ought
to
do
elma
is
to
give
me
half
of
the
balance
over
and
above
what
you
borrowed
that
would
be
three
pounds
ten
for
me
quite
a
nice
little
sum
it
would
keep
me
in
ribbons
gloves
and
boots
for
a
bit
i
get
such
a
very
small
salary
well
the
money
has
not
been
doubled
it
time
enough
to
talk
of
our
chickens
when
they
are
hatched
said
elma
she
rose
from
her
seat
looking
despairingly
at
the
open
letter
which
she
held
in
her
hand
after
all
i
may
as
well
take
this
up
to
mother
she
said
one
moment
before
you
go
elma
would
you
like
me
to
help
you
or
would
you
not
if
you
could
help
me
carrie
of
course
i
should
be
obliged
and
what
is
the
punishment
they

inflicted
upon
that
irish
lass
oh

me
carrie
i

about

yesterday
she

none
of
us

speak
to
her
all
the
same
you
did
speak
to
her
last
night
do
forget
yes
i
could
not
help
myself
but
if
it
was
found
out
it
would
go
hard
with
us
both
then
i
am
the
one
to
interfere
said
carrie
i
do
my
best
elma
and
trust
to
you
to
make
it
up
to
me
when
i
have
got
you
out
of
this
scrape
i
wish
you
would
do
something
carrie

it
awful
to
think
of
aunt
charlotte

now
if

kitty

sure
to
tell
and
then
it
will
be
all
over
the
school
they
wo
blame
her
so
much
as
they
blame
me
oh
dear
dear
if
you
would
do
something
well
i
promise
that
i
just
will
said
carrie
now
go
off
to
school
with
an
easy
mind
chapter
xix
kitty
tells
the
truth
early
the
next
morning
kitty
received
her
telegram
it
certainly
was
not
at
all
calculated
to
soothe
her
she
was
restless
and
miserable
before
now
her
hands
shook
so
violently
that
she
could
scarcely
eat
her
breakfast
alice
acted
somewhat
the
part
of
a
jailer
she
had
to
convey
the
disgraced
girl
to
middleton
school
i
am
ill
i
wo
go
said
kitty
bursting
into
tears
you
had
much
better
come
kitty
said
alice
speaking
almost
kindly
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
really
pitied
poor
kitty
at
that
moment
if
you
will
only
take
your
punishment
patiently
it
will
soon
be
over
and
i
know
for
a
fact
she
continued
that
many
of
the
girls
are
only
too
anxious
to
make
it
up
to
you
by
and
by
oh
it
not
that
said
kitty
it
is
because
i
am
so
wretched
i
have
a
great
trouble
at
home
but
there
there
no
use
in
talking
to
you
about
it
alice
so
you
always
say
answered
alice
whenever
i
want
to
be
the
least
bit
good
to
you
you
put
me
off
but
never
mind
i
am
sure
i
can
do
without
your
friendship
anyhow
i
think
you
must
come
to
school
unless
you
are
so
ill
that
mother
will
be
obliged
to
send
for
the
doctor
oh
i
do
want
that
said
kitty
i
never
had
a
doctor
in
my
life
if
you
wait
for
me
alice
i
go
upstairs
and
put
on
my
hat
she
rushed
to
her
room
flung
herself
on
her
knees
for
a
moment
by
her
bedside
and
uttered
a
frantic
prayer
to
heaven
oh
god
in
your
mercy
keep
laurie
from
doing
anything
desperate
cried
the
unhappy
girl
she
then
joined
alice
downstairs
her
face
was
white
there
were
heavy
black
lines
under
her
eyes
she
had
never
looked
prettier
more
pathetic
more
likely
to
win
sympathy
from
the
other
girls
at
prayers
that
morning
all
eyes
were
directed
to
kitty
malone
she
was
not
allowed
to
sit
with
the
others
but
was
given
a
place
on
the
bench
with
the
teachers
here
she
faced
the
rest
of
the
school
it
would
have
been
a
cruel
position
for
another
girl
but
it
did
not
matter
to
kitty
for
she
saw
no
one
present
her
eyes
with
that
queer
inward
look
in
them
were
gazing
straight
not
at
the
scene
before
her
but
at
the
old
home
in
ireland
the
squire
whom
she
so
passionately
loved
roused
to
the
last
extremity
of
anger
the
boy
whose
heart
was
hers
crushed
trapped
imprisoned
his
liberty
taken
from
him
kitty
trembled
from
head
to
foot
she
could
scarcely
restrain
her
terrible
emotion
after
school
she
accompanied
the
others
to
the
classroom
but
in
absolute
silence
she
was
given
her
usual
lessons
to
do
but
at
a
table
by
herself
her
punishment
was
to
be
carried
out
in
all
its
fullness
but
dreadful
as
it
would
seem
to
most
it
did
not
touch
her
at
all
her
head
ached
her
eyes
felt
dim
laurie
telegram
which
lay
in
her
pocket
seemed
to
scorch
into
the
very
depths
of
her
heart
she
had
not
even
been
allowed
to
answer
it
the
whole
weight
of
her
trouble
lay
unrelieved
upon
her
the
poor
child
was
unaccustomed
to
such
anguish
and
her
was
in
danger
moment
by
moment
of
giving
way
as
she
strove
to
get
that
dull
piece
of
english
history
into
her
head
as
she
endeavored
to
follow
the
rules
of
syntax
as
the
knowledge
that
she
never
never
to
the
longest
day
of
her
life
would
understand
what
was
meant
by
the
possessive
case
alongside
with
these
feeble
little
efforts
to
follow
her
lessons
ran
the
dark
thought
of
how
by
what
possible
means
she
could
help
laurie
and
more
and
more
as
the
time
went
on
she
felt
that
she
could
not
keep
her
promise
to
elma
elma
had
been
cruel
to
her
she
had
borrowed
her
money
when
she
knew
she
had
not
the
most
remote
chance
of
paying
it
back
she
had
spent
it
according
to
her
own
saying
in
the
most
frivolous
way
now
for
the
first
time
kitty
learned
to
despise
dress
how
could
elma
spend
the
money
which
was
to
save
laurie
in
anything
so
contemptible
as
ribbons
and
finery
kitty
looked
down
at
her
own
clothes
her
perfect
little
shoes
peeped
out
from
beneath
the
frill
of
her
dress
notwithstanding
her
misery
she
was
as
neat
as
usual
in
her
attire
but
now
she
had
no
heart
to
appreciate
gay
clothes
good
looks
pretty
ribbons
any
of
the
things
which
usually
delighted
her
laurie
seemed
to
cry
to
her
she
fancied
she
could
hear
his
voice
coming
across
the
waters
to
her
ears
laurie
who
had
always
trusted
to
her
who
strong
as
he
was
was
not
quite
so
strong
as
kitty
when
scrapes
and
troubles
were
about
oh
if
only
she
could
go
to
him
if
only
she
might
relieve
her
feelings
and
tell
the
exact
truth
to
miss
sherrard
what
kept
her
back
nothing
whatever
but
the
thought
of
elma
she
had
given
elma
a
promise
and
tempted
as
she
was
she
must
not
break
it
as
this
thought
came
to
her
she
remembered
that
she
had
only
promised
elma
to
keep
the
secret
until
after
morning
school
that
time
would
soon
be
up
once
miss
sherrard
knows
i
am
certain
she
will
help
me
thought
kitty
though
i
do
want
to
excuse
myself
yet
i
know
that
a
great
deal
of
the
blame
of
my
proceedings
will
be
lifted
from
my
shoulders
to
elma
why
should
i
go
through
all
the
suffering
and
elma
sit
there
looking
so
calm
and
quiet
and
still
as
these
thoughts
rushed
through
kitty
mind
she
glanced
up
for
the
first
time
and
calmly
surveyed
the
great
room
full
of
her
as
if
with
one
impulse
all
the
girls
raised
their
eyes
and
looked
back
at
her
there
was
pity
on
most
of
the
faces
amusement
on
a
few
curiosity
on
a
few
others
but
on
elma
face
alone
was
an
expression
of
intense
anxiety
and
misery
kitty
had
the
kindest
heart
in
the
world
the
moment
she
saw
this
expression
the
idea
of
betraying
elma
melted
from
her
mind
she
does
look
wretched
she
said
to
herself
i
must
not
speak
to
her
i
dare
not
and
yet
yet
i
should
like
her
to
know
that
i
am
not
going
to
be
hard
on
her
kitty
tore
off
a
piece
of
her
exercise
book
and
managed
when
she
thought
no
one
would
see
to
write
a
little
note
to
elma
in
this
she
said
do
be
afraid
elma
i
have
made
up
my
mind
not
to
tell
this
note
she
twisted
up
and
as
the
girls
were
going
to
the
playground
for
recess
managed
to
flash
an
intelligent
glance
toward
elma
elma
approached
close
to
her
table
kitty
stretched
out
her
hand
and
fingers
were
just
about
to
close
over
the
note
when
by
an
unlucky
chance
there
came
a
breeze
through
the
window
and
the
note
for
some
inconceivable
reason
fluttered
from
kitty
hand
to
the
floor
in
an
instant
miss
worrick
had
seen
it
she
was
just
stepping
forward
when
elma
like
a
flash
caught
it
up
and
tore
it
into
fragments
she
would
not
for
the
world
have
the
note
seen
miss
worrick
filled
with
anger
came
up
to
kitty
you
are
a
bad
girl
the
worst
girl
i
know
she
said
you
are
not
even
honorable
did
you
not
give
your
parole
that
you
would
not
hold
communication
with
another
girl
in
the
school
and
yet
you
have
been
trying
to
communicate
with
elma
lewis
by
means
of
writing
writing
is
not
speaking
said
kitty
now
standing
up
very
erect
and
proud
and
replying
to
miss
worrick
as
pertly
as
she
could
do
answer
me
miss
you
grow
worse
and
worse
elma
lewis
do
you
know
anything
about
that
note
kitty
looked
full
at
elma
if
she
was
going
to
be
true
to
elma
would
elma
be
equally
true
to
her
i
know
nothing
about
it
said
elma
promptly
kitty
eyes
filled
with
withering
scorn
an
expression
of
disdain
curled
her
pretty
lips
you
are
quite
certain
elma
kitty
malone
seems
to
have
a
great
anxiety
to
communicate
with
you
can
you
throw
any
light
on
the
scrape
she
has
got
into
i
know
nothing
whatever
about
her
secrets
i
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
them
said
elma
in
an
agitated
voice
which
she
endeavored
in
vain
to
render
calm
gwin
harley
who
had
stopped
on
her
way
out
of
the
classroom
paused
to
listen
to
elma
words
kitty
face
was
now
white
as
death
she
did
not
glance
at
elma
she
was
looking
the
other
way
leave
us
girls
said
miss
worrick
the
next
moment
the
great
classroom
was
empty
with
the
exception
of
miss
worrick
and
kitty
malone
kitty
was
standing
upright
as
a
dart
take
me
to
miss
sherrard
i
want
to
speak
to
her
she
said
i
am
certainly
going
to
take
you
to
her
you
are
a
very
very
wicked
girl
i
doubt
not
you
will
be
expelled
oh
i
hope
i
shall
said
kitty
i
should
like
nothing
in
all
the
world
better
you
would
you
are
quite
incorrigible
do
you
know
you
wretched
girl
what
it
means
no
answered
kitty
i
wait
for
you
to
tell
me
what
does
it
mean
miss
worrick
that
you
are
tainted
for
life
disgraced
for
life
wherever
you
go
it
will
be
always
remembered
to
you
that
your
conduct
was
so
bad
at
school
that
you
were
obliged
to
be
expelled
but
that
wo
matter
in
old
ireland
said
kitty
with
a
hollow
forced
laugh
yes
it
will
it
will
break
your
father
heart
there
are
no
people
so
proud
as
the
irish
they
can
stand
a
good
deal
but
any
cloud
on
their
honor
ah
you
are
right
cried
kitty
standing
still
and
a
queer
change
coming
over
her
face
our
honor
no
one
ever
touched
that
yet
it
will
have
a
nice
blow
when
you
are
dismissed
from
middleton
school
said
miss
worrick
glad
to
find
a
point
in
kitty
hitherto
invulnerable
armor
come
with
me
at
once
you
bad
girl
i
must
explain
your
conduct
to
miss
sherrard
i
have
something
on
my
own
account
to
say
to
miss
sherrard
answered
kitty
in
a
proud
voice
something
which
will
explain
a
good
deal
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
but
i
scarcely
think
any
words
of
yours
can
remove
the
stigma
on
your
character
but
come
i
have
no
time
to
argue
with
you
further
miss
worrick
now
led
the
way
into
miss
sherrard
little
miss
sherrard
was
standing
near
the
window
she
turned
quickly
when
she
saw
miss
worrick
and
a
displeased
and
withal
a
troubled
glance
filled
her
eyes
as
they
rested
upon
kitty
anything
fresh
she
said
turning
to
the
teacher
with
a
weary
expression
in
her
voice
only
just
what
i
expected
said
miss
worrick
with
bitterness
kitty
malone
is
not
to
be
trusted
yesterday
she
gave
her
word
of
honor
i
did
interrupted
kitty
kitty
my
dear
allow
your
teacher
to
speak
she
gave
her
word
of
honor
or
equivalent
to
it
that
she
would
submit
to
the
punishment
which
you
rightly
inflicted
upon
her
well
i
found
her
just
now
in
the
act
of
smuggling
a
note
into
elma
lewis
hand
oh
but
this
is
very
bad
kitty
said
miss
sherrard
did
you
not
know
what
your
word
of
honor
meant
i
never
promised
anything
replied
kitty
you
spoke
but
i
was
silent
pardon
me
my
dear
that
is
begging
the
question
you
were
told
that
you
were
not
to
communicate
with
any
of
your
your
silence
signified
consent
kitty
i
am
ashamed
of
you
as
you
know
so
much
you
may
as
well
know
all
said
kitty
desperation
in
her
tone
i
did
far
worse
than
you
think
last
night
i
went
out
again
after
dark
by
myself
to
see
elma
lewis
i
had
an
interview
with
her
i
talked
to
her
and
she
talked
to
me
that
was
not
exactly
her
fault
for
i
forced
her
to
speak
now
you
know
how
very
bad
i
am
expel
me
if
you
wish
i
know
you
will
after
this
i
am
in
dreadful
disgrace
i
only
wish
i
were
dead
leave
us
miss
worrick
said
miss
sherrard
the
door
was
closed
behind
the
governess
and
the
taking
one
of
kitty
cold
hands
led
her
to
a
seat
near
herself
on
the
sofa
there
is
more
behind
she
said
kitty
you
must
tell
me
the
truth
i
long
to
tell
you
answered
kitty
a
short
time
back
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
conceal
it
because
the
telling
would
make
another
girl
miserable
miserable
for
life
now
my
feelings
are
changed
i
am
glad
that
you
are
at
last
willing
to
confide
in
me
said
miss
sherrard
in
a
kinder
tone
tell
me
everything
kitty
and
as
quickly
as
you
can
thus
counseled
kitty
reserve
absolutely
gave
way
the
whole
miserable
story
was
quickly
revealed
elma
lewis
request
for
money
generous
response
laurie
passionate
and
anguished
letter
desire
to
help
him
her
reasons
which
had
almost
driven
her
mad
for
seeking
elma
her
desperate
resolve
at
last
to
go
to
her
late
at
night
then
elma
passionate
beseeching
of
her
to
keep
the
secret
promise
that
she
would
do
so
until
after
morning
school
that
day
then
her
further
resolve
when
she
saw
the
look
of
misery
on
elma
face
to
keep
it
altogether
even
at
the
cost
of
breaking
laurie
heart
then
elma
conduct
when
the
note
was
discovered
i
scorn
her
now
said
kitty
i
do
regard
any
promise
i
ever
made
to
her
i
am
glad
to
tell
she
is
false
cowardly
and
i
scorn
her
miss
sherrard
you
know
everything
expel
me
if
you
must
yes
i
know
everything
replied
miss
sherrard
she
sat
still
for
a
few
moments
lost
in
anxious
thought
she
blamed
kitty
still
but
she
also
deeply
pitied
her
her
feelings
toward
elma
were
so
strong
that
she
could
scarcely
trust
herself
to
speak
of
them
at
the
present
moment
my
honor
is
gone
and
my
heart
is
broken
continued
kitty
of
course
you
will
expel
me
after
this
and
indeed
i
want
to
go
home
please
miss
sherrard
let
me
go
home
i
can
not
stay
any
longer
at
school
my
dear
kitty
said
miss
sherrard
i
am
very
sorry
for
you
i
am
certainly
glad
at
last
to
know
the
truth
you
poor
child
have
been
more
sinned
against
than
sinning
i
can
not
tell
you
what
i
think
about
elma
such
a
girl
does
more
mischief
in
a
school
than
twenty
like

dear

crying
kitty
kitty
what
is
it
i
feel
nearly
mad
laurie
is
in
such
trouble

i
not
at
least
answer
his
telegram
yes

a
telegraph
form
fill
in
what
you
like
i
will
send
it
at
once
to
the
post
office
miss
sherrard
would
it
be
possible
for
you
to
lend
me
the
money
miss
sherrard
shook
her
head
i
could
not
do
it
kitty
nor
would
it
be
right
your
brother
has
done
distinctly
wrong
and
if
you
telegraph
to
him
now
i
hope
you
will
counsel
him
to
go
straight
to
your
father
and
confess
everything
there
is
never
the
least
use
in
concealment
where
is
concerned
my
dear
but
kitty
eyes
had
now
blazed
again
with
renewed
passion
you
are
not
a
malone
nor
an
irishwoman
she
cried
you
do
not
know
ireland
or
you
would
not
speak
in
that
tone
i
counsel
laurie
to
tell
father
what
he
did
to
poor
paddy
i
counsel
him
to
say
that
he
took
the
old
man
coat
stole
it
from
him
miss
sherrard
you
know
father
laurie
did
it
it
is
true
in
a
fit
of
bravado
but
father
would
never
understand
he
would
be
furious
wild
le
would
punish
him
severely
oh
i
must
get
that
money
somehow
in
some
fashion
kitty
you
are
speaking
disrespectfully
said
miss
sherrard
and
i
can
not
allow
it
i
am
sorry
for
you
my
dear
you
are
dreadfully
overcome
at
present
go
home
now
i
will
see
you
again
in
the
afternoon
poor
kitty
left
the
room
without
even
bidding
her
teacher
chapter
xx
an
in
her
own
room
the
miserable
child
fell
on
her
knees
and
gave
way
to
a
burst
of
passionate
weeping
she
cried
as
she
had
never
cried
in
the
whole
course
of
her
life
before
her
tears
seemed
as
though
they
could
not
cease
she
was
so
exhausted
at
last
that
kneeling
by
her
little
bed
she
fell
into
a
sound
sleep
in
her
sleep
she
dreamed
that
she
was
home
again
but
all
was
confusion
worry
distress
laurie
was
going
to
a
school
in
england
laurie
heart
was
broken
old
paddy
was
dead
the
squire
was
so
upset
and
so
angry
that
he
would
not
even
allow
kitty
herself
to
comfort
him
aunt
honora
was
grumbling
and
going
from
room
to
room
in
the
old
castle
aunt
bridget
was
talking
about
dress
and
scolding
kitty
with
regard
to
the
state
of
her
wardrobe
kitty
head
ached
and
she
felt
a
sense
of
irritation
and
it
so
pretty
said
aunt
honora
those
ruffles
round
the
skirt
are
done
in
such
a
dainty
manner
and
oh
i
wo
disturb
you
if
allow
me
just
to
take
the
pattern
i
can
in
a
moment
do
move
move
kitty
opened
her
eyes
in
some
bewilderment
and
gazed
full
into
the
fat
and
somewhat
red
face
of
carrie
lewis
it
was
carrie
voice
she
had
heard
piercing
through
her
dreams
it
was
carrie
who
was
bending
by
her
side
and
holding
up
a
length
of
her
skirt
in
her
hand
oh
do
move
pray
i
have
just
got
the
set
of
it
it
very
curious
and
very
fashionable
i
know
sam
would
like
it
awfully
who
are
you
and
what
do
you
want
said
kitty
jumping
to
her
feet
and
confronting
her
unwelcome
visitor
with
flushed
cheeks
and
sparkling
eyes
i
knocked
at
your
door
several
times
and
you
did
answer
said
carrie
so
then
i
opened
it
softly
and
came
in
and
you
were
by
your
bed
sound
asleep
and
your
skirt
did
look
so
very
fashionable
that
i
was
tempted
oh
yes
i
have
taken
the
pattern
in
my
mind
eye
i
alter
my
blue
i
can
easily
get
a
bit
more
of
the
stuff
to
match
and
it
will
make
it
quite
il
but
who
are
you
said
kitty
who
had
never
laid
eyes
on
carrie
before
i
elma
sister
now
you
know
elma
sister
said
kitty
but
what
have
you
come
to
my
room
for
what
do
you
want
here
to
speak
to
you
i
want
to
help
you
if
you
let
me
to
help
me
said
kitty
languidly
i
would
much
rather
you
went
away
you
can
not
help
me
you
know
nothing
whatever
about
me
i
am
in
great
great
trouble
and
i
would
much
rather
be
alone
you
would
not
rather
be
alone
if
you
could
be
helped
said
carrie
i
know
all
about
it
you
have
got
a
brother
in
ireland
who
has
got
into
a
scrape
bless
you
i
know
all
about
the
scrapes
of
young
men
now
poor
sam
raynes
he
yes
what
is
it
miss
malone
i
wish
you
would
leave
me
said
kitty
in
a
haughty
tone
i
am
not
friends
with
elma
just
now
and
i
would
rather
not
see
any
of
her
family
yes
but
i
think
you
see
me
when
i
tell
you
my
errand
said
carrie
in
no
way
abashed
by
kitty
manner
she
crossed
the
room
as
she
spoke
and
deliberately
placing
herself
in
the
one
the
room
possessed
crossed
her
legs
and
leaning
back
looked
fixedly
at
kitty
very
well
if
you
wo
go
then
i
must
said
kitty
i
understand
english
people
they
talk
a
great
deal
about
manners
but
no
irishwoman
none
that
i
ever
heard
of
would
dream
oh
bosh
stop
all
that
said
carrie
in
her
rudest
voice
i
have
come
here
to
help
you
and
i
see
that
i
must
explain
myself
you
want
some
money
do
you
yes
but
i
can
not
get
it
answered
kitty
oh
my
dear
do
just
stay
still
a
moment
what
a
sweet
little
shoe
did
you
get
it
at
any
shop
here
no
answered
kitty
interested
for
the
moment
in
spite
of
herself
aunt
honora
bought
these
in
grafton
street
dublin
they
have
the
nicest
shoes
in
that
special
shop
of
any
place
i
know
do
you
like
it
oh
it
is
quite
sweet
it
is
the
way
the
heel
is
arranged
and
that
little
buckle
well
never
mind
about
my
shoes
now
said
kitty
pushing
the
attractive
little
foot
well
in
under
her
skirt
what
is
it
you
have
come
to
say
please
say
it
and
then
go
i
will
if
you
wish
me
to
look
here
i
know
all
about
your
story
you
are
in
dreadful
trouble
and
so
is
elma
but
i
do
declare
i
think
poor
elma
trouble
much
worse
than
yours
you
know
nothing
about
it
cried
kitty
with
passion
elma
in
worse
trouble
oh
if
you
only
could
guess
i
guess
well
enough
said
carrie
and
so
does
elma
you
want
money
which
evidently
as
a
rule
is
as
plentiful
to
you
as
blackberries
on
the
hedges
in
september
and
you
think
because
you
can
not
lay
your
hand
on
that
money
immediately
the
whole
world
is
going
to
change
but
let
me
tell
you
that
elma
and
i
want
money
far
far
more
badly
than
you
have
any
idea
of
until
you
gave
elma
that
eight
pounds
we
neither
of
us
ever
in
our
lives
had
so
much
in
our
possession
i
did
give
it
you
make
a
mistake
i
lent
it
oh
it
is
all
the
same
elma
had
it
and
for
practical
purposes
it
was
just
as
valuable
as
if
it
were
really
her
own
well
i
want
her
to
give
it
back
to
me
now
i
surely
have
a
right
to
ask
for
my
own
money
back
again
no
you
have
not
not
without
reasonable
notice
she
asked
you
to
lend
her
some
money
she
never
asked
for
eight
pounds
you
let
her
take
it
you
said
she
might
have
as
much
as
she
liked
when
she
explained
the
position
of
things
to
me
i
said
you
were
a
rare
fool
not
to
take
the
whole
fifteen
you
must
be
a
very
queer
girl
said
kitty
astonished
at
this
remarkable
specimen
of
young
ladyhood
am
i
i
do
know
i
am
frank
and
i
am
generally
i
know
if
any
one
does
where
the
shoe
pinches
bless
you
it
would
do
you
good
to
open
your
eyes
you
do
know
what
poverty
means
a
little
house
a
disgusting
little
house
shabby
paper
dirty
ceilings
floors
the
drains
wrong
the
as
likely
to
poison
us
as
not
an
invalid
mother
oh
have
you
a
mother
then
i
am
sure
you
are
not
to
be
pitied
interrupted
kitty
little
you
know
what
good
is
a
mother
who
is
in
bed
most
of
the
day
a
father
who
well
i
need
not
mention
him
he
is
not
in
the
country
at
any
rate
no
education
to
speak
of
no
dress
worth
considering
toil
toil
from
morning
till
night
and
life
a
mere
scramble
a
scramble
for
bread
without
butter
that
what
our
life
is
kitty
had
ceased
to
fidget
she
even
sank
down
on
the
corner
of
the
nearest
chair
her
pretty
figure
her
dress
her
whole
appearance
from
the
crown
of
her
head
to
the
sole
of
her
foot
betokened
what
the
other
girl
could
never
aspire
to
never
hope
to
have
abundance
of
money
and
yet
at
the
present
moment
kitty
was
breaking
her
heart
for
want
of
money
no
wonder
carrie
was
puzzled
kitty
own
eyes
were
opened
to
an
extent
they
had
never
been
opened
before
yes
our
life
is
a
rough
one
continued
carrie
very
rough
indeed
but
i
do
grumble
i
was
brought
up
to
it
and
use
is
half
the
battle
as
perhaps
you
do
know
but
you
ought
you
get
accustomed
to
doing
without
your
eight
pounds
after
a
bit
and
never
give
it
another
thought
oh
no
that
i
wo
said
kitty
now
jumping
to
her
feet
in
her
indignation
and
it
is
not
for
myself
it
is
for
oh
never
mind
who
it
is
for
you
want
it
and
you
think
the
world
is
going
to
stand
still
because
you
can
not
get
it
well
the
world
stand
still
i
who
am
quite
used
to
doing
without
money
can
assure
you
as
to
the
truth
of
that
fact
would
you
like
to
know
now
how
i
spend
my
days
i
teach
some
horrid
children
in
a
small
private
school
from
ten
to
one
each
morning
and
then
in
the
afternoon
i
go
to
a
family
and
teach
some
more
little
brats
and
i
am
scarcely
paid
anything
for
all
this
toil
starvation
wages
i
call
it
and
i
hate
it
hate
it
but
i
have
my
consolations
i
am
not
overparticular
very
small
pleasures
content
me
and
there
a
fellow
whom
i
love
a
fellow
whom
you
love
echoed
kitty
is
it
a
brother
bless
you
i
not
likely
to
put
myself
out
about
a
brother
not
that
i
have
one
and
so
much
the
better
thank
goodness
there
a
man
whom
i
love
and
a
right
jolly
fellow
he
is
his
name
is
sam
raynes
he
is
not
one
of
your
fine
gentlemen
not
he
he
is
rough
and
ready
and
he
has
his
joke
and
he
is
too
handsome
although
some
people
admire
red
hair
but
anyhow
i
fond
of
him
and
he
fond
of
me
and
some
day
i
do
know
when
when
we
can
scrape
enough
together
we
are
going
to
set
up
housekeeping
you
are
going
to
marry
is
that
it
said
kitty
yes
some
day
we
marry
now
you
see
that
a
bit
of
fun
for
me
and
i
can
go
out
with
sam
on
bank
holidays
and
on
sunday
afternoons
just
like
any
other
girl
with
her
young
man
bless
you
i
do
mind
i
wonder
what
all
this
is
leading
up
to
said
kitty
with
a
slight
yawn
of
course
it
is
very
interesting
to
you
but
i
do
care
about
your
young
man
no
more
you
do
you
haughty
little
minx
and
i
would
bother
you
about
him
for
with
all
his
faults
he
too
good
to
have
words
wasted
about
him
to
a
little
independent
chit
of
a
thing
like
you
but
as
i
was
saying
i
not
talking
for
nothing
i
leading
up
to
something
now
i
am
content
enough
with
our
lot
but
elma
is
elma
is
quite
different
from
me
she
has
got
a
great
deal
of
refinement
about
her
has
she
indeed
said
kitty
in
a
voice
of
scorn
yes
she
has
and
you
need
contradict
me
she
a
very
clever
girl
is
elma
i
do
say
that
she
always
as
straight
as
a
die
i
pretend
that
she
is
but
she
is
a
clever
girl
and
she
is
fond
of
her
books
and
she
likely
to
get
on
that
is
if
you
do
spike
her
guns
what
do
you
mean
oh
well
it
only
an
expression
of
mine
i
heard
sam
use
it
last
week
i
often
copy
his
phrases
they
so
fine
and
full
of
flourish
well
now
if
you
do
spoil
sport
elma
will
get
into
an
altogether
different
circle
from
your
humble
servant
mother
and
i
will
go
one
way
and
elma
another
elma
with
her
grand
notions
and
her
sort
of
airs
will
rise
in
life
she
heartily
welcome
to
go
her
own
way
and
i
wish
her
godspeed
for
she
is
the
only
sister
i
have
got
i
do
understand
interrupted
kitty
if
you
let
me
speak
i
soon
explain
you
do
suppose
that
girls
such
as
i
am
are
often
to
be
seen
at
middleton
school
well
i
have
not
seen
any
like
you
said
kitty
gazing
from
head
to
foot
at
her
very
peculiar
visitor
no
more
you
have
bless
you
and
i
not
the
least
offended
by
your
very
frank
stare
sam
admires
me
and
that
enough
for
me
now
elma
looks
a
lady
does
she
i
suppose
so
said
kitty
in
a
dubious
tone
you
suppose
so
indeed
let
me
tell
you
that
elma
is
a
born
little
lady
a
real
lady
and
she
looks
it
every
inch
of
her
that
is
why
she
goes
to
middleton
school
but
now
who
do
you
think
pay
for
her
how
can
i
tell
do
you
think
mother
or
father
or
i
now
who
do
you
think
does
i
should
be
interested
to
know
your
thoughts
i
can
not
really
tell
you
miss
lewis
oh
it
does
sound
fine
to
hear
you
miss
lewising
me
my
name
is
carrie
i
prefer
to
call
you
miss
lewis
highty
tighty
we
are
haughty
well
the
person
who
pays
for
elma
is
our
aunt
charlotte
a
certain
mrs
steward
wife
of
the
reverend
john
steward
rector
of
bartholomew
buckinghamshire
there
a
grand
enough
name
for
you
and
i
suppose
being
a
clergyman
you
consider
that
he
is
a
gentleman
and
that
his
wife
is
a
lady
aunt
charlotte
happens
to
be
own
sister
to
mother
and
when
elma
made
her
little
complaint
to
her
she
took
pity
on
her
and
now
she
pays
all
her
expenses
at
middleton
school
and
if
elma
does
well
and
nothing
disagreeable
comes
to
aunt
charlotte
ears
she
will
send
her
presently
to
newnham
or
girton
think
of
that
i
elma
will
be
a
college
girl
she
will
be
an
undergraduate
of
one
of
the
universities
and
some
day
a
graduate
and
then
she
will
get
a
post
as
mistress
or
mistress
of
something
or
other
but
if
you
tell
on
her
and
make
things
bad
and
the
truth
gets
out
you
look
pale
are
you
ill
i
am
all
right
said
kitty
she
staggered
across
the
room
and
poured
some
water
into
a
glass
i
did
not
eat
much
lunch
she
continued
and
i
am
never
mind
go
on
well
continued
carrie
if
nothing
comes
to
aunt
charlotte
ears
to
turn
her
mind
the
other
way
elma
will
be
all
right
she
will
move
in
your
sphere
yes
she
will
whether
you
like
it
or
not
she
is
just
so
clever
she
is
able
to
do
anything
so
i
have
come
to
say
that
i
hope
to
goodness
you
wo
split
on
her
for
it
would
be
mighty
cruel
of
you
you
would
ruin
her
for
life
and
that
would
be
a
nice
consolation
for
you
when
you
came
to
die
she
did
not
steal
your
money
remember
you
gave
it
to
her
i
lent
it
to
her
oh
how
you
will
harp
upon
that
but
you
did
tell
her
to
a
day
when
she
was
to
pay
it
back
again
no
i
certainly
did
not
but
of
course
i
expected
that
she
would
return
it
to
me
when
i
asked
for
it
and
then
she
spent
it
on
dress
spent
it
on
dress
what
do
you
mean
she
told
me
so
oh
naughty
naughty
little
elma
said
carrie
shaking
her
forefinger
in
a
very
knowing
manner
she
did
like
to
tell
about
sam
and
so
she
made
up
that
story
did
she
well
it
was
an
untruth
she
did
spend
that
money
on
dress
she
well
i
will
tell
you
i
stole
it
from
her
you
gasped
kitty
backing
away
in
horror
yes
good
gracious
how
scared
you
are
you
do
understand
the
larks
of
girls
like
me
i
did
mean
any
harm
i
took
it
and
gave
it
to
sam
to
keep
for
her
then
said
kitty
coming
close
up
to
carrie
her
lips
parted
the
color
flooding
her
cheeks
her
eyes
full
of
light
then
of
course
you
carrie
oh
i
carrie
now
am
i
yes
you
are
but
never
mind
then
you
carrie
can
get
it
back
for
me
so
i
will
all
in
good
time
my
pretty
little
dear
you
shall
have
the
money
if
you
are
willing
to
wait
say
a
month
there
no
use
at
all
in
that
said
kitty
her
voice
sounding
faint
and
far
away
i
am
afraid
there
must
be
as
far
as
that
eight
pounds
is
concerned
the
fact
is
sam
is
speculating
with
the
money
and
when
we
get
it
back
it
will
be
doubled
elma
and
i
will
divide
the
profits
between
us
and
you
shall
have
your
eight
pounds
back
now
i
think
i
have
told
you
everything
except
and
having
told
me
i
wish
you
would
go
away
said
kitty
i
know
that
you
have
bettered
matters
in
any
way
of
course
i
am
sorry
for
elma
but
it
is
only
right
that
you
should
know
something
it
would
be
well
also
for
elma
to
know
the
truth
i
told
her
yesterday
when
i
went
to
your
house
that
i
would
keep
her
secret
until
after
morning
school
good
gracious
you
have
not
blurted
out
the
truth
wait
till
you
hear
when
i
was
at
school
this
morning
i
was
oh
so
miserable
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
but
never
mind
you
would
not
understand
no
no
of
course
not
pray
proceed
i
was
thinking
how
soon
i
might
tell
nice
sort
of
creature
you
are
why
will
you
interrupt
me
said
kitty
but
then
i
looked
at
elma
and
i
saw
that
she
seemed
very
anxious
and
miserable
and
wretched
as
i
was
i
made
up
my
mind
to
be
kind
to
her
i
said
to
myself
i
will
keep
her
secret
and
and
i
wrote
her
a
note
to
tell
her
so
you
would
not
understand
if
i
said
any
more
but
but
immediately
after
morning
school
she
she
was
false
to
me
utterly
false
you
ask
her
when
you
see
her
how
she
received
that
letter
i
wrote
to
her
at
the
risk
of
getting
into
terrible
trouble
myself
i
have
been
angry
furious
beside
myself
and
now
miss
sherrard
knows
everything
you
do
mean
it
said
carrie
her
florid
face
had
turned
perfectly
white
she
bit
her
lip
and
looked
out
of
the
window
after
a
time
she
looked
back
again
at
kitty
and
said
slowly
you
are
very
cruel
and
you
have
ruined
elma
but
after
all
it
is
partly
my
fault
i
ought
not
to
have
taken
that
money
now
look
here
shall
i
tell
you
what
i
really
came
for
if
you
would
do
so
quickly
and
then
go
you
wo
be
in
such
a
hurry
to
part
from
me
when
you
know
the
truth
now
then
listen
you
want
some
money
i
think
i
see
a
way
to
getting
it
for
you
do
you
really
yes
i
do
that
is
if
you
on
your
part
will
do
what
i
want
i
will
do
anything
to
get
the
money
i
want
to
send
it
to
laurie
if
i
can
this
evening
there
nothing
i
would
not
give
you
i
will
remember
that
small
promise
presently
said
carrie
in
a
frank
voice
but
now
let
me
tell
you
what
my
plan
is
you
have
a
great
many
clothes
have
you
not
yes
but
please
do
bother
me
about
them
now
i
was
always
fond
of
pretty
dress
but
i
should
not
care
if
i
had
to
wear
rags
at
the
present
moment
if
only
i
might
get
that
eight
pounds
if
them
your
sentiments
said
carrie
you
very
soon
can
have
your
wish
what
in
the
world
do
you
mean
why
this
if
you
just
allow
me
to
take
the
pick
of
your
wardrobe
i
can
take
away
the
things
and
sell
them
i
soon
bring
back
the
eight
pounds
yes
and
for
that
matter
ten
too
sell
my
clothes
said
kitty
she
stared
at
the
other
girl
as
if
she
did
not
believe
the
evidence
of
her
own
senses
yes
did
you
never
hear
of
a
pawnshop
you
dear
little
wiseacre
a
pawnshop
do
you
think
i
would
allow
my
clothes
to
go
to
a
pawnshop
i
know
nothing
whatever
about
it
but
i
make
you
the
proposal
i
will
transact
the
business
for
you
if
you
allow
me
ten
per
cent
upon
it
i
can
get
you
the
money
oh
carrie
it
seems
such
a
bitter
shame
said
kitty
her
face
was
crimson
she
went
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
opened
the
window
and
put
out
her
head
she
wanted
the
cool
air
to
soothe
her
scorched
cheeks
her
heart
was
thumping
in
her
breast
had
matters
indeed
come
to
this
that
she
kitty
malone
was
to
pawn
her
pretty
dresses
her
trinkets
her
whatnots
alas
she
could
not
do
it
i
have
often
had
to
do
it
said
carrie
i
know
just
how
to
manage
if
you
allow
me
to
select
the
most
suitable
of
your
things
i
bring
you
back
the
money
in
no
time
you
are
sure
said
kitty
beginning
to
yield
certain
sure
positive
but
you
must
allow
me
ten
per
cent
i
know
nothing
about
percentage
but
you
may
take
every
scrap
that
is
over
after
you
have
got
me
the
eight
pounds
very
well
that
a
liberal
offer
said
carrie
now
then
i
may
as
well
take
a
look
at
your
clothes
oh
it
seems
such
an
awful
thing
to
do
said
kitty
are
you
sure
quite
sure
that
no
one
will
find
it
out
not
a
bit
of
it
that
is
if
you
be
quick
and
not
allow
that
other
girl
alice
you
call
her
to
come
into
the
room
i
lock
the
door
said
kitty
she
rushed
across
the
room
with
new
hope
turned
the
key
and
came
back
again
to
carrie
i
never
heard
of
anything
quite
so
extraordinary
in
my
life
she
said
and
you
you
call
yourself
a
lady
no
i
do
i
call
myself
a
lump
of
a
girl
well
perhaps
you
are
but
to
pawn
one
things
do
you
mean
that
i
will
never
see
them
again
oh
yes
whenever
you
like
to
return
the
money
they
be
kept
safe
enough
for
you
if
you
do
return
the
money
of
course
they
belong
to
the
pawnbroker
but
you
have
lots
of
time
to
think
of
that
look
here
i
pawn
them
for
a
month
that
will
give
you
heaps
of
time
to
look
round
so
it
will
said
kitty
and
are
you
quite
quite
certain
that
i
shall
have
the
money
oh
yes
if
you
wo
talk
so
much
only
act
now
then
open
your
wardrobe
kitty
unlocked
the
door
of
the
mahogany
wardrobe
which
she
shared
with
alice
and
carrie
began
to
pull
her
choice
little
garments
about
kitty
went
and
stood
by
the
window
do
you
want
to
know
what
i
am
taking
said
carrie
do
you
want
to
make
a
selection
no
i
leave
it
all
to
you
i
ca
bear
to
see
them
take
take
what
you
want
goodness
what
a
girl
thought
carrie
to
herself
here
an
opportunity
for
me
she
made
a
hasty
and
very
wise
selection
choosing
the
richest
dresses
the
most
stylish
jackets
skirts
shoes
ribbons
gloves
clipping
the
feathers
out
of
the
hats
and
the
flowers
from
the
toques
throwing
in
some
of
the
finest
cambric
handkerchiefs
and
then
taking
a
sheet
of
brown
paper
which
she
had
put
into
a
basket
on
her
arm
when
she
left
home
she
folded
the
things
into
it
and
fastened
her
parcel
with
stout
string
here
i
am
she
said
and
this
is
my
parcel
i
have
looked
through
your
wardrobe
your
clothes

neat
fine
some
of
them
gaudy
but
all
good
i
can
get
from
three
to
four
pounds
for
this
lot
but
why
do
you
take
enough
to
get
the
eight
pounds
said
kitty
who
had
quite
made
up
her
mind
by
this
time
i
could
not
carry
any
more
now
then
open
your
quick
my
oh

can
not
part
with
my
jewels
you
must
if
you
want
your
eight
pounds
by

my
pawnbroker
he

pounds
for

little
parcel

alice
denvers
coming
up
the
road
with
that
other
fine
young
lady
bessie
challoner
where
your
kitty
face
was
like
a
sheet
i
have
not
any
jewels
she
said
or
scarcely
any
worth
mentioning
i
did
bring
any
jewels
with
me
but
here
my
watch
will
that
do

beauty

your
own
counsel

then

off
to
the
pawnshop
and
you
shall
have
the

revoir
an

chapter
xxi
the
lady
from
buckinghamshire
mrs
steward
was
a
great
contrast
to
lewis
mrs
steward
was
a
tall
thin
rather
woman
lewis
was
fat
and
dumpy
decidedly
untidy
in
appearance
with
a
melancholy
air
and
a
habit
of
constantly
indulging
in
low
weeping
mrs
steward
looked
as
if
she
had
never
wept
in
her
life
she
sat
upright
as
a
dart
her
movements
were
quick
her
manners
independent
she
had
a
vivacious
eye
a
somewhat
short
nose
thin
lips
and
a
very
decided
manner
mrs
steward
and
lewis
had
a
long
conversation
in
the
untidy
ugly
little
parlor
while
they
waited
for
elma
to
return
from
school
maggie
had
been
going
in
and
out
glancing
with
some
apprehension
at
the
lady
and
then
whisking
back
to
her
kitchen
to
sigh
profoundly
and
mourn
for
the
violets
which
were
no
longer
in
her
possession
i
should
like
something
to
eat
said
mrs
steward
to
her
sister
i
thought
i
would
come
to
you
for
lunch
caroline
have
you
got
anything
in
the
house
a
lamb
chop
or
even
cold
lamb
and
salad
will
do
quite
nicely
my
dear
charlotte
said
lewis
laying
her
fat
tremulous
hand
upon
her
sister
firm
but
thin
arm
do
you
think
it
likely
that
we
often
have
lamb
chops
or
even
cold
lamb
and
salad
for
lunch
it
is
true
that
since
the
australian
meat
came
in
we
can
now
and
then
indulge
in
a
very
small
joint
of
lamb
for
sundays
but
certainly
on
no
other
day
ah
charlotte
you
little
know
the
poverty
to
which
your
poor
sister
is
subjected
i
know
all
about
it
said
stewart
shaking
herself
angrily
and
my
plain
answer
to
you
is
this
as
you
sow
you
must
reap
what
else
did
you
expect
when
you
married
that
fool
of
a
man
james
lewis
lewis
made
a
great
endeavor
to
rise
from
the
sofa
she
made
a
further
effort
to
look
dignified
but
all
she
could
really
accomplish
was
to
burst
into
a
fresh
wail
of
low
weeping
and
to
murmur
under
her
breath
charlotte
you
are
cruel
to
me
you
are
cruel
i
do
mean
to
be
my
dear
but
really
caroline
you
do
annoy
me
have
you
no
spunk
at
all
in
your
composition
are
you
still
fretting
your
heart
out
for
that
man
well
you
see
i
love
him
said
the
poor
wife
the
parting
from
my
dear
husband
was
a
terrible
trial
i
think
of
him
at
all
hours
both
day
and
night
i
often
have
an
uncontrollable
desire
to
join
him
in
australia
pray
yield
to
it
said
mrs
steward
in
the
calmest
of
voices
and
when
you
go
take
that
great
lout
of
a
caroline
with
you
she
is
as
like
you
in
appearance
as
one
pea
is
like
another
i
am
ashamed
of
you
now
let
us
turn
to
a
more
congenial
topic
little
elma
i
am
glad
to
say
is
made
of
very
different
stuff
oh
elma
is
a
good
girl
said
lewis
at
that
moment
maggie
came
into
the
room
have
you
ordered
your
servant
to
prepare
any
lunch
for
me
said
mrs
steward
well
really
lewis
looked
imploringly
and
with
a
vacant
eye
at
maggie
there
the
remains
of
the
salt
beef
mum
said
that
small
worthy
dropping
a
bob
of
a
courtesy
as
she
spoke
i
could
touch
it
said
mrs
steward
with
a
shudder
have
you
got
a
fresh
egg
in
the
house
oh
my
dear
nothing
of
the
kind
a
fresh
egg
fresh
eggs
are
worth
their
weight
in
gold
we
have
a
stale
egg
if
you
do
mind
that
mrs
steward
indulged
in
another
shudder
even
more
violent
than
the
last
my
good
girl
she
said
then
pray
get
me
a
cup
of
tea
and
some
thin
toast
and
be
quick
about
it
see
that
the
tea
is
really
strong
and
the
cream
fresh
cream
murmured
lewis
but
maggie
had
withdrawn
well
now
that
is
comfortably
settled
said
mrs
steward
and
i
can
tell
you
what
really
brought
me
to
town
i
have
come
about
elma
indeed
and
what
about
her
i
mean
to
take
her
from
you
to
take
elma
away
from
me
my
own
dear
child
oh
now
come
caroline
do
sicken
me
with
your
false
sentiment
it
is
a
precious
good
thing
for
elma
that
she
has
got
an
aunt
ready
and
willing
to
help
her
i
have
just
arranged
to
send
her
to
a
german
school
her
english
i
should
say
was
fair
and
she
will
be
taken
as
she
will
thus
have
the
advantage
of
learning
german
i
heard
of
this
through
a
great
friend
of
mine
fräulein
van
brunt
she
is
going
to
germany
herself
next
week
and
will
take
elma
if
you
can
spare
her
if
i
can
spare
her
but
it
will
break
my
heart
such
a
sensible
girl
as
she
is
said
poor
lewis
come
come
carrie
no
more
nonsense
when
i
explain
all
the
advantages
you
will
see
for
yourself
how
it
is
that
elma
should
go
the
school
is
in
the
harz
mountains
a
splendid
place
magnificent
air
and
all
the
rest
if
elma
stays
there
for
two
years
i
will
then
have
her
home
and
send
her
to
girton
as
i
promised
i
will
further
arrange
that
she
spends
her
holidays
with
me
as
i
think
really
here
mrs
steward
glanced
round
the
shabby
room
i
think
that
the
less
she
remains
with
her
own
family
for
the
present
the
better
i
see
what
you
mean
i
am
beneath
my
own
child
beneath
her
well
it
is
a
painful
thing
to
say
but
as
you
put
it
so
frankly
i
must
reply
in
the
affirmative
replied
mrs
steward
ah
who
is
this
now
the
door
was
flung
open
and
carrie
very
red
about
the
face
and
with
her
parcel
under
her
arm
entered
the
room
her
intention
was
to
ask
her
mother
to
accompany
her
to
the
pawnshop
it
had
not
been
the
first
nor
the
second
nor
the
third
time
that
the
unfortunate
lady
had
been
obliged
to
pawn
her
things
carrie
thought
that
her
parent
could
make
a
better
bargain
than
she
could
herself
and
she
hoped
that
she
would
have
been
in
time
to
transact
this
little
business
before
the
arrival
of
her
aunt
she
now
gave
a
start
of
dismay
and
dropping
the
parcel
sank
down
on
the
nearest
chair
as
she
did
so
kitty
watch
and
chain
tumbled
out
of
the
front
of
her
dress
where
she
had
very
insecurely
fastened
them
the
watch
was
a
lovely
one
with
an
enameled
back
studded
with
pearls
and
the
chain
was
made
of
gold
owing
to
a
warning
glance
from
carrie
lewis
refrained
from
saying
a
word
but
mrs
steward
had
no
idea
of
keeping
her
emotions
to
herself
you
i
presume
are
carrie
she
said
looking
at
her
niece
come
here
carrie
and
speak
to
your
aunt
carrie
advanced
as
if
she
were
treading
on
buttered
eggs
she
held
out
one
dimpled
hand
gingerly
how
do
you
do
my
dear
allow
me
to
congratulate
you
on
the
acquisition
of
that
very
lovely
little
watch
and
that
splendid
chain
now
i
am
devoured
with
curiosity
to
know
who
has
given
them
to
you
surely
not
your
mother
surely
caroline
with
all
your
faults
you
have
not
oh
dear
me
no
said
lewis
carrie
indulged
in
a
loud
laugh
bless
us
aunt
she
cried
do
you
suppose
mother
can
afford
to
give
me
these
no
i
she
grew
red
and
turned
away
lewis
fidgeted
on
her
seat
and
appeared
thoroughly
uncomfortable
i
do
not
wish
to
pry
into
your
secrets
caroline
said
mrs
steward
favoring
the
untidy
and
girl
with
a
glance
full
of
reprehension
you
are
at
liberty
to
wear
handsome
watches
and
chains
made
of
the
best
gold
if
your
mother
cares
to
see
you
with
things
so
unsuitable
to
your
class
and
appearance
your
doings
in
life
are
no
affair
of
mine
but
now
as
you
happen
to
be
my
niece
will
you
have
the
kindness
to
go
immediately
into
the
kitchen
and
tell
maggie
or
whatever
the
name
of
your
servant
is
to
hurry
with
that
tea
and
toast
carrie
was
only
too
glad
to
dart
from
the
room
she
picked
up
her
parcel
and
resorted
to
the
kitchen
oh
miss
carrie
i
do
wish
you
would
help
me
said
maggie
who
was
flying
distractedly
about
there
the
kitchen
fire
all
but
out
and
the
lady
ordered
toast
as
crisp
as
you
please
i
do
believe
we
can
do
it
for
her
would
she
be
content
with
thin
bread
and
butter
curled
in
rolls
oh
of
course
she
would
and
must
said
carrie
she
is
in
no
end
of
a
temper
and
for
my
part
i
do
wish
to
humor
her
yes
of
course
maggie
i
cut
the
bread
and
butter
and
make
it
into
rolls
and
you
see
to
the
tea
thank
you
miss
i
sure
i
much
obliged
and
perhaps
miss
you
would
mind
taking
it
into
the
for
her
eyes
do
fasten
on
to
you
that
fierce
that
i
get
all
of
a
tremble
and
as
likely
as
not
i
drop
the
tray
carrie
laughed
and
being
at
heart
in
her
own
way
helped
maggie
with
some
vigor
to
prepare
the
tea
at
last
a
meal
which
could
not
be
remarked
for
its
abundance
was
forthcoming
and
was
brought
into
the
i
ordered
toast
said
mrs
steward
in
an
angry
voice
i
am
sorry
aunt
charlotte
said
carrie
but
the
fire
happened
to
be
out
in
the
kitchen
you
see
she
added
somewhat
spitefully
we
are
obliged
to
economize
with
coals
and
we
do
keep
a
fire
up
in
the
middle
of
the
day
well
i
am
really
so
famished
that
i
am
content
with
anything
said
the
good
lady
pour
me
out
a
cup
of
tea
at
once
my
dear
and
just
put
the
bread
and
butter
where
i
can
reach
it
carrie
did
so
winking
at
her
mother
as
she
arranged
the
tray
the
next
moment
lewis
went
out
into
the
passage
carrie
followed
her
closing
the
door
behind
their
guest
mother
i
want
you
to
come
with
me
to
the
sign
of
the
three
balls
what
in
the
world
for
carrie
i
have
got
to
pawn
some
things
some
beautiful
things
and
i
am
to
get
ten
per
cent
on
the
commission
i
shall
turn
over
a
nice
little
bit
of
money
and
you
can
have
your
favorite
supper
you
will
come
wo
you
mother
and
i
give
you
half
a
crown
into
the
bargain
oh
dear
dear
said
lewis
i
wish
she
had
not
come
she
never
helps
me
in
any
way
all
she
does
is
to
scold
me
and
make
me
more
depressed
than
i
am
already
and
she
blames
me
so
for
marrying
your
poor
father
carrie
as
if
i
could
help
that
now
and
what
do
you
think
she
is
going
to
do
she
says
she
is
going
to
take
elma
from
us
and
a
good
thing
too
said
carrie
carrie
what
an
unnatural
girl
you
are
do
you
mean
to
say
you
would
be
glad
to
part
from
your
sister
i
would
because
i
am
fond
of
her
and
she
has
got
into
the
most
awful
scrape
at
school
do
you
put
any
spoke
in
her
wheel
mother
for
goodness
sake
at
that
moment
the
latchkey
was
heard
in
the
lock
and
elma
herself
appeared
on
the
scene
oh
good
gracious
elma
cried
carrie
darting
up
to
her
sister
and
beginning
to
whisper
vigorously
into
her
ear
what
said
elma
with
a
start
of
dismay
so
soon
yes
yes
she
been
here
for
nearly
an
hour
she
is
devouring
rolled
bread
and
butter
and
tea
in
the
at
present
she
asked
for
toast
yes
interrupted
lewis
who
now
came
up
and
began
also
to
whisper
yes
and
fresh
eggs
and
cream
and
lamb
chops
and
cold
lamb
and
salad
i
never
heard
of
anything
so
unreasonable
my
poor
head
is
in
an
awful
whirl
but
she
has
come
about
you
elma
she
wants
to
take
you
away
with
her
she
wants
to
take
me
away
with
her
exclaimed
elma
starting
and
her
pale
face
flushing
and
you
had
better
go
elma
and
be
quick
about
it
said
carrie
giving
her
a
warning
glance
i
do
know
what
all
this
means
said
elma
her
heart
beating
uncomfortably
fast
but
i
had
better
go
in
and
see
aunt
charlotte
yes
my
love
yes
and
while
you
are
talking
to
her
i
what
do
you
say
carrie
you
and
i
might
go
out
upon
that
little
matter
of
business
might
we
not
to
be
sure
mother
an
excellent
thought
if
you
stay
here
i
run
upstairs
and
fetch
your
bonnet
veil
and
mantle
in
a
twinkling
go
in
to
aunt
charlotte
elma
do
for
goodness
sake
make
yourself
of
use
more
depends
on
it
than
you
think
if
she
hears
us
whispering
and
mattering
in
the
hall
she
be
out
upon
us
elma
instinctively
put
up
her
two
hands
to
smooth
back
her
hair
she
straightened
her
already
perfectly
neat
little
jacket
and
drawing
herself
up
to
her
full
height
entered
the
little
elma
was
a
perfect
contrast
to
her
untidy
mother
and
her
frowzy
sister
however
poorly
dressed
she
was
always
the
pink
of
neatness
she
was
full
of
agitation
now
and
nervous
fear
but
not
a
trace
of
these
emotions
could
be
visible
in
her
manner
and
appearance
she
went
up
to
her
aunt
charlotte
who
for
her
part
held
out
both
her
arms
and
drawing
the
girl
down
printed
a
kiss
upon
her
cheek
i
am
really
glad
to
see
you
elma
exclaimed
mrs
steward
sit
near
me
my
dear
it
is
a
pity
you
were
not
in
when
i
arrived
it
was
the
least
you
might
have
done
for
your
aunt
elma
you
had
my
letter
this
morning
oh
my
poor
child
i
have
gone
through
a
dreadful
hour
these
vulgar
relations
of
yours
grow
worse
and
worse
my
mother
and
sister
murmured
elma
yes
it
is
a
terrible
affliction
for
you
but
my
dear
i
am
going
to
relieve
you
from
the
strain
i
your
aunt
am
coming
to
the
rescue
there
elma
pour
me
out
another
cup
of
tea
and
i
will
tell
you
everything
elma
raised
the
teapot
she
filled
her
aunt
cup
with
fresh
tea
added
a
little
milk
and
brought
it
to
her
side
thank
you
my
dear
now
elma
you
may
consider
yourself
a
made
girl
made
echoed
elma
turning
her
white
face
to
mrs
steward
yes
made
what
would
you
say
to
going
abroad
elma
eyes
brightened
do
you
mean
on
the
continent
yes
i
do
my
dear
child
to
no
less
a
place
than
the
harz
mountains
i
have
heard
of
a
most
charming
school
fifty
times
better
than
middleton
school
and
you
are
to
go
there
my
dear
elma
at
my
expense
you
will
go
as
and
you
thus
acquire
perfect
german
think
what
that
will
mean
for
you
i
propose
to
leave
you
in
germany
for
two
years
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
you
will
return
and
go
to
girton
i
being
responsible
for
all
your
expenses
my
dear
your
fortune
is
made
i
have
further
arranged
with
your
poor
unfortunate
mother
that
you
spend
the
holidays
with
me
as
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
you
can
associate
any
longer
with
such
a
person
nor
with
that
frowzy
young
woman
who
calls
herself
your
sister
elma
did
not
speak
this
news
which
would
have
delighted
her
at
another
and
less
harassing
moment
was
now
fraught
with
perplexity
and
alarm
at
the
same
time
she
thought
she
saw
in
it
a
possible
means
of
escape
suppose
aunt
charlotte
took
her
away
at
once
before
kitty
had
time
to
tell
what
she
knew
before
middleton
school
had
time
to
ring
with
the
news
of
her
dishonor
oh
if
so
she
might
indeed
be
saved
am
i
to
go
immediately
she
asked
choking
down
a
strangled
sob
in
her
throat
or
am
i
to
stay
at
middleton
school
till
the
end
of
the
term
well
dear
that
is
the
awkward
part
for
of
course
you
are
working
very
hard
for
a
prize
are
you
not
i
am
working
for
a
small
scholarship
answered
elma
if
i
succeed
in
my
examination
i
shall
obtain
a
scholarship
in
english
literature
worth
ten
pounds
a
year
for
three
years
that
would
be
a
very
large
sum
to
me
aunt
charlotte
a
large
sum
to
you
i
should
think
it
would
be
a
large
sum
to
anybody
said
mrs
steward
in
a
severe
tone
ten
pounds
is
quite
a
fortune
for
any
young
girl
pray
do
begin
to
speak
of
money
in
that
disparaging
sort
of
way
elma
it
ill
suits
your
circumstances
my
love
but
now
dear
i
am
sorry
to
disappoint
you
i
have
heard
of
an
admirable
escort
a
certain
fräulein
van
brunt
is
going
to
the
harz
mountains
next
monday
it
will
therefore
be
necessary
for
me
to
take
you
back
to
buckinghamshire
elma
oh
aunt
charlotte
i
am
glad
burst
from
elma
lips
glad
to
leave
your
mother
and
sister
said
mrs
steward
looking
severely
at
the
young
girl
after
all
they
are
the
last
people
you
ought
to
associate
with
but
still
natural
ties
my
dear
elma
oh
i
am
sorry
to
leave
them
i
am
sorry
to
go
i
am
both
glad
and
sorry
gasped
poor
elma
i
have
been
worried
and
am
glad
to
get
out
of
everything
worried
i
suppose
with
that
dreadful
sister
and
your
poor
muddled
mother
her
unfortunate
habit
of
weeping
has
reduced
the
little
brain
she
possessed
to
a
state
of
pap
of
course
i
know
she
is
not
well
off
but
all
she
absolutely
could
offer
me
in
this
house
was
a
stale
egg
and
not
even
toast
oh
i
scorn
to
complain
but
i
know
this
is
not
your
wish
elma
your
ideas
were
always
very
different
my
dear
child
elma
did
not
say
anything
she
was
fidgeting
with
her
hand
making
a
slight
noise
with
the
teaspoon
which
she
was
tapping
against
a
saucer
the
noise
was
irritating
to
mrs
steward
nerves
that
calm
of
manner
which
i
trust
you
will
acquire
after
you
have
had
the
advantages
which
i
am
giving
you
will
soon
show
you
how
very
unpleasant
those
little
tattoos
and
small
noises
are
elma
remarked
the
good
lady
taking
the
teaspoon
severely
out
of
her
niece
hand
yes
my
dear
you
are
to
come
with
me
that
is
of
course
what
do
you
mean
by
course
aunt
charlotte
after
i
have
seen
your
miss
sherrard
do
you
want
to
see
miss
sherrard
asked
elma
a
note
of
alarm
in
her
voice
certainly
and
i
am
going
immediately
to
the
school
you
will
not
be
admitted
into
the
admirable
school
in
germany
without
a
testimonial
from
your
present
teacher
and
i
am
going
to
miss
sherrard
in
order
to
secure
one
it
will
of
course
be
merely
a
matter
of
form
my
asking
for
it
for
your
conduct
has
always
been
admirable
admirable
in
the
extreme
miss
sherrard
has
written
to
me
about
you
from
time
to
time
and
always
spoke
of
you
with
affection
and
admiration
she
said
your
abilities
were
good
your
moral
character
without
a
flaw
i
will
just
step
across
to
the
school
now
elma
and
if
you
like
you
can
accompany
me
elma
hesitated
she
did
not
yet
know
what
had
taken
place
but
when
she
had
last
seen
kitty
there
was
a
flash
in
her
eyes
the
reverse
of
assuring
she
could
only
hope
against
hope
that
nothing
had
yet
taken
place
that
kitty
had
still
kept
her
miserable
secret
if
miss
sherrard
knew
nothing
she
would
of
course
give
her
an
excellent
character
and
she
herself
would
leave
middleton
school
that
afternoon
and
forever
then
indeed
she
might
snap
her
fingers
at
kitty
and
her
distress
she
would
be
saved
just
at
the
very
moment
when
she
thought
her
ruin
most
imminent
chapter
xxii
stunned
and
cold
come
elma
what
are
you
looking
so
thoughtful
about
asked
mrs
steward
in
an
impatient
voice
nothing
aunt
charlotte
replied
elma
rising
to
her
feet
i
am
ready
to
go
she
added
she
sighed
as
she
spoke
you
must
give
up
that
unpleasant
habit
my
dear
child
nothing
irritates
me
more
than
hearing
people
sigh
it
always
seems
as
if
they
were
discontented
and
ungrateful
to
providence
now
what
have
you
for
instance
to
sigh
about
a
singularly
fortunate
girl
a
girl
who
possesses
an
aunt
who
is
willing
to
take
a
mother
duties
upon
her
shoulders
if
it
were
that
wretched
vulgar
carrie
now
or
even
my
poor
sister
herself
but
you
elma
do
let
me
think
that
you
are
ungrateful
to
me
or
i
wash
my
hands
of
you
on
the
spot
oh
i
am
nothing
of
the
kind
indeed
aunt
charlotte
replied
elma
i
always
have
felt
that
you
you
were
more
than
good
to
me
well
my
dear
that
as
it
should
be
i
honor
your
feelings
i
often
say
to
myself
and
to
your
remember
he
is
not
your
real
uncle
elma
but
your
my
dear
husband
the
rector
of
bartholomew
i
say
elma
does
show
gratitude
for
all
i
am
doing
for
her
i
shall
once
and
for
all
give
up
the
human
race
i
shall
never
again
expect
right
feeling
from
any
one
but
of
course
you
are
grateful
elma
you
will
be
the
comfort
of
my
old
age
you
will
be
as
my
own
child
to
me
i
i
sometimes
think
my
dear
that
when
your
education
is
finished
and
you
are
turned
into
a
refined
woman
i
will
keep
you
with
me
you
shall
be
my
companion
my
housekeeper
the
one
who
is
to
read
aloud
to
me
to
sit
with
me
in
the
long
evenings
when
my
sight
begins
to
fail
my
eyes
do
ache
at
times
my
dear
i
have
thought
of
all
that
you
will
be
my
adopted
child
not
that
i
can
leave
you
anything
in
my
will
but
i
would
provide
a
home
for
you
while
i
am
left
in
this
tabernacle
of
the
flesh
what
do
you
say
elma
eh
it
is
too
soon
to
say
anything
at
present
answered
elma
to
whom
this
prospect
was
the
reverse
of
charming
to
live
as
her
aunt
unsalaried
companion
could
not
be
attractive
to
her
but
she
wisely
concluded
that
sufficient
unto
the
day
was
the
evil
thereof
and
she
had
yet
to
be
educated
and
brought
to
that
calm
of
spirit
and
strain
of
intellect
which
would
satisfy
aunt
charlotte
come
now
at
once
said
the
good
lady
who
suddenly
from
being
in
a
very
cross
temper
became
in
the
best
of
humor
we
have
just
nice
time
to
go
across
to
the
school
and
then
after
we
have
seen
miss
sherrard
to
return
here
for
you
to
pack
your
things
what
do
you
say
elma
to
our
both
staying
in
london
it
would
be
a
pleasant
treat
for
you
and
there
may
be
a
few
little
things
necessary
to
add
to
your
wardrobe
which
i
shall
have
much
pleasure
in
providing
you
with
elma
you
are
in
rare
luck
when
i
think
of
all
i
am
doing
for
you
i
feel
that
you
have
indeed
much
to
be
thankful
for
yes
aunt
charlotte
echoed
elma
but
her
voice
sounded
faint
and
she
brought
out
her
words
with
an
effort
leaning
on
her
niece
arm
mrs
steward
now
pursued
her
way
to
middleton
school
alas
her
journey
there
quickly
dissipated
her
lately
acquired
she
had
not
gone
one
hundred
yards
before
she
complained
of
the
dust
of
the
roads
she
had
not
gone
two
before
her
anger
was
great
at
the
length
of
the
way
and
when
she
found
that
it
was
necessary
to
mount
uphill
her
complaints
became
loud
grievances
in
short
by
the
time
she
really
arrived
at
the
school
she
was
in
as
bad
a
temper
as
elma
had
ever
seen
her
in
what
it
is
to
have
a
great
girl
like
you
hanging
on
to
one
dependent
on
one
she
cried
it
was
most
inconsiderate
of
caroline
to
marry
as
she
did
and
she
now
even
complains
when
i
blame
her
for
it
she
is
an
extraordinary
person
if
she
had
remained
single
she
might
have
been
living
comfortably
with
me
at
bartholomew
rectory
and
you
and
carrie
would
never
have
been
in
the
world
plaguing
your
relatives
well
you
see
we
are
in
the
world
said
poor
elma
who
felt
that
she
must
just
show
the
faintest
spark
of
spirit
we
did
not
ask
to
be
born
she
added
so
i
do
see
that
we
are
to
be
blamed
mrs
steward
favored
her
with
a
sharp
glance
elma
she
said
if
you
indulge
in
pertness
i
shall
wash
my
hands
of
you
now
here
we
are
have
the
goodness
to
ring
the
bell
the
great
school
door
was
opened
presently
by
a
and
mrs
steward
inquired
in
a
tart
voice
if
miss
sherrard
was
in
she
is
replied
the
girl
but
she
is
particularly
engaged
at
this
moment
oh
is
that
you
miss
lewis
she
continued
miss
sherrard
is
just
sending
for
you
miss
but
i
do
think
the
messenger
has
gone
yet
i
run
and
stop
him
will
you
walk
inside
a
messenger
for
me
murmured
elma
she
felt
terribly
uncomfortable
her
face
grew
whiter
than
ever
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
tell
your
mistress
that
i
wish
to
speak
to
her
at
once
said
mrs
steward
that
i
am
in
a
hurry
and
can
not
be
kept
waiting
pray
mention
my
name
mrs
steward
from
rectory
buckinghamshire
the
girl
promised
to
do
so
and
withdrew
she
soon
returned
to
say
that
miss
sherrard
would
be
pleased
to
see
both
mrs
steward
and
miss
lewis
in
her
private
room
i
wish
to
see
miss
sherrard
alone
said
mrs
steward
remain
where
you
are
elma
mrs
steward
sailed
out
of
the
room
and
poor
elma
sank
down
on
the
nearest
chair
if
miss
sherrard
has
sent
for
me
she
must
know
something
thought
the
wretched
girl
oh
how
am
i
to
live
through
it
she
will
tell
aunt
charlotte
and
then
all
my
prospects
are
over
meanwhile
mrs
steward
sailed
down
the
passage
with
a
dignity
and
majesty
of
demeanor
which
impressed
miss
sherrard
neat
handmaid
considerably
the
next
instant
she
was
ushered
into
the
presence
miss
sherrard
looked
troubled
she
came
forward
to
meet
mrs
steward
very
gravely
and
motioning
with
her
hand
to
a
chair
asked
her
to
seat
herself
mrs
steward
stared
for
a
moment
at
the
and
the
stared
back
at
her
at
last
mrs
steward
said
glibly
i
am
sorry
to
take
up
any
of
your
valuable
time
miss
sherrard
but
i
think
i
can
explain
my
errand
in
a
few
words
i
am
about
to
remove
my
niece
elma
lewis
from
the
school
indeed
i
am
heartily
glad
to
hear
it
answered
miss
sherrard
visible
relief
both
in
her
tone
and
face
what
an
extraordinary
remark
for
you
to
make
but
i
will
pass
it
by
for
i
am
in
a
considerable
hurry
i
have
heard
of
an
admirable
school
in
germany
to
which
i
intend
to
send
my
niece
not
that
i
have
the
least
objection
to
your
mode
of
teaching
miss
sherrard
nor
to
this
very
celebrated
school
but
of
course
when
it
comes
to
foreign
languages
you
can
not
compare
england
to
the
continent
certainly
not
answered
miss
sherrard
who
was
now
staring
at
the
other
lady
in
some
wonder
it
is
my
intention
to
remove
elma
continued
mrs
steward
for
although
it
is
not
quite
the
end
of
term
yet
the
harz
mountains
are
some
distance
away
and
it
would
not
be
possible
for
a
young
girl
who
has
at
present
no
knowledge
of
the
german
language
to
go
so
far
without
an
escort
miss
sherrard
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
that
an
escort
has
been
found
a
suitable
escort
and
elma
will
leave
england
next
week
under
these
circumstance
i
propose
to
take
her
back
to
my
husband
rectory
in
buckinghamshire
morning
and
she
will
leave
the
school
now
indeed
i
repeat
that
this
is
a
most
fortunate
coincidence
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
said
miss
sherrard
your
remarks
seem
to
me
the
reverse
of
flattering
but
i
have
no
time
to
ask
you
to
explain
them
what
i
have
really
come
about
is
this
it
is
necessary
for
elma
to
have
a
certificate
from
her
present
mistress
in
order
to
be
admitted
into
the
very
school
in
germany
where
i
propose
to
place
her
will
you
kindly
give
me
a
testimonial
in
my
niece
favor
miss
sherrard
just
say
anything
you
can
to
the
credit
of
her
character
and
general
attainments
from
your
many
letters
to
me
i
judge
that
you
have
a
very
high
opinion
of
the
dear
girl
and
i
trust
now
that
i
am
doing
so
much
in
starting
this
young
girl
in
life
that
i
shall
not
go
unrewarded
the
care
of
the
young
is
a
sad
trial
miss
sherrard
and
i
doubt
not
that
the
looking
after
elma
will
worry
me
considerably
but
i
am
not
one
to
shirk
my
duties
and
i
am
willing
to
take
all
this
responsibility
and
for
the
future
to
regard
that
young
girl
as
if
she
were
indeed
my
own
child
but
i
must
have
the
testimonial
so
will
you
kindly
write
it
at
once
miss
sherrard
had
been
sitting
with
her
hands
clasped
in
her
lap
while
mrs
steward
was
speaking
once
she
had
lowered
her
eyes
but
during
the
greater
part
of
the
time
they
were
fixed
upon
the
good
lady
face
a
look
of
consternation
almost
akin
to
despair
flitted
now
over
the
teacher
expressive
countenance
when
at
last
mrs
steward
ceased
to
speak
miss
sherrard
still
remained
for
nearly
half
a
minute
quite
silent
you
will
perhaps
oblige
me
by
writing
the
testimonial
said
mrs
steward
in
a
very
haughty
voice
then
she
added
perceiving
that
something
was
wrong
and
finding
it
impossible
to
guess
what
i
dare
say
you
are
annoyed
at
elma
leaving
the
school
so
unexpectedly
no
no
nothing
of
the
kind
said
miss
sherrard
i
have
told
you
twice
mrs
steward
that
i
am
glad
very
glad
of
this
your
words
surprise
me
but
of
course
you
will
write
my
time
is
precious
i
have
not
a
moment
to
lose
miss
sherrard
now
stood
up
i
can
not
give
elma
lewis
a
testimonial
with
regard
to
conduct
the
words
came
out
quietly
firmly
distinctly
mrs
steward
sprang
to
her
feet
you
can
not
give
my
niece
a
testimonial
with
regard
to
conduct
she
gasped
do
you
know
what
you
are
saying
what
you
are
doing
miss
sherrard
perfectly
well
mrs
steward
in
your
letters
to
me
you
have
invariably
spoken
of
elma
conduct
as
excellent
miss
sherrard
you
surely
forget
yourself
you
can
not
be
well
you
must
be
mistaking
elma
for
one
of
your
other
pupils
she
has
always
been
an
exemplary
girl
you
can
not
give
her
a
testimonial
with
regard
to
conduct
am
i
to
believe
the
testimony
of
my
own
ears
i
am
deeply
sorry
i
have
seldom
been
more
grieved
about
anything
i
am
told
that
elma
has
accompanied
you
here
if
you
will
permit
me
i
will
send
for
her
and
explain
how
matters
really
stand
in
your
presence
oh
this
is
intolerable
said
mrs
steward
clasping
and
unclasping
her
hands
in
her
agitation
the
wicked
girl
what
has
she
done
pray
send
for
her
at
once
miss
sherrard
if
she
has
done
anything
really
disgraceful
i
wash
my
hands
of
her
if
you
her
mistress
can
not
give
her
a
certificate
do
you
suppose
that
my
husband
and
i
will
take
her
up
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
say
madam
in
this
emergency
to
really
help
elma
would
be
a
christian
act
she
may
have
been
tempted
beyond
her
strength
but
you
will
be
better
able
to
decide
when
you
know
the
circumstances
as
miss
sherrard
spoke
she
rang
the
bell
when
the
servant
appeared
she
desired
her
to
bring
elma
immediately
into
her
presence
a
moment
later
the
young
girl
entered
the
room
she
gave
a
wild
and
frightened
glance
first
at
her
aunt
then
at
miss
sherrard
then
stepping
forward
fell
on
her
knees
has
kitty
told
you
she
gasped
yes
elma
get
up
you
can
not
kneel
to
me
rise
this
minute
you
wicked
girl
said
mrs
steward
elma
staggered
to
her
feet
it
is
all
up
then
she
murmured
i
know
everything
elma
said
miss
sherrard
the
knowledge
has
come
to
me
as
a
painful
surprise
your
aunt
has
just
asked
me
to
give
you
a
testimonial
with
regard
to
character
i
am
bitterly
pained
to
say
that
i
must
refuse
to
do
so
but
what
does
it
all
mean
cried
mrs
steward
and
why
am
i
to
be
kept
in
the
dark
any
longer
elma
stop
twirling
your
thumbs
stand
back
now
miss
sherrard
i
have
paid
the
school
fees
for
elma
lewis
for
the
last
four
years
so
i
presume
i
am
entitled
to
know
all
about
her
tell
me
what
has
occurred
of
what
she
is
accused
miss
sherrard
then
briefly
related
the
story
which
had
been
told
to
her
by
kitty
it
was
exactly
the
sort
of
tale
which
would
affect
a
woman
of
mrs
steward
caliber
disagreeably
she
listened
with
a
face
when
the
had
finished
she
said
abruptly
what
do
you
propose
to
do
now
it
will
be
necessary
for
me
to
explain
the
whole
circumstances
of
elma
to
the
entire
school
said
miss
sherrard
this
is
necessary
for
the
sake
of
kitty
malone
at
what
hour
do
you
propose
to
make
this
very
pleasant
exhibition
of
my
niece
after
prayers
morning
i
sent
for
you
elma
continued
miss
sherrard
to
tell
you
as
i
thought
you
ought
to
be
prepared
thank
you
answered
elma
her
head
bowed
on
her
breast
she
felt
stunned
and
cold
the
dreadful
blow
had
fallen
but
the
acute
misery
which
was
immediately
to
follow
was
not
at
present
awakened
within
her
come
elma
said
mrs
steward
she
turned
to
leave
the
room
just
as
she
reached
the
door
she
looked
back
at
miss
sherrard
after
you
have
exposed
elma
and
ruined
her
character
for
life
you
will
doubtless
expel
her
she
said
i
hope
not
i
think
not
in
any
case
she
leaves
the
school
for
i
pay
no
more
fees
come
elma
chapter
xxiii
stars
and
moon
and
god
behind
during
the
long
walk
home
to
constantine
road
the
elder
and
the
younger
lady
maintained
an
absolute
silence
as
soon
as
they
got
to
the
house
mrs
steward
turned
to
elma
for
the
first
time
and
spoke
find
out
immediately
if
your
mother
is
in
if
she
is
tell
her
i
wish
to
see
her
go
do
stare
at
me
elma
went
without
a
word
her
mother
was
in
and
so
was
carrie
mother
said
elma
aunt
charlotte
wants
to
see
you
why
my
dear
elma
what
is
the
matter
how
queer
you
look
do
mind
about
me
mother
pray
the
expression
of
my
face
is
not
worth
considering
aunt
charlotte
is
waiting
for
you
in
the
lewis
gave
a
profound
sigh
how
very
unreasonable
of
charlotte
she
said
she
will
doubtless
be
expecting
more
tea
and
cream
and
fresh
eggs
and
other
impossibilities
oh
go
mother
and
stop
talking
said
elma
lewis
dragged
herself
up
from
the
sofa
on
which
she
was
reclining
i
really
do
know
what
the
world
is
coming
to
she
said
even
my
own
children
are
turning
out
quite
disagreeable
to
me
dear
dear
what
it
is
to
be
a
mother
how
little
those
who
are
fortunate
in
not
possessing
children
understand
the
burden
she
went
downstairs
slowly
and
elma
turned
to
carrie
carrie
was
standing
with
her
back
to
her
she
was
making
up
something
in
well
elma
she
said
looking
up
at
her
sister
what
is
up
everything
is
up
said
elma
what
do
you
mean
everything
is
up
and
everything
is
over
what
are
you
doing
with
that
paper
carrie
i
am
folding
up
the
money
i
have
just
got
for
kitty
malone
the
money
you
have
got
for
kitty
malone
has
has
sam
raynes
returned
the
sovereigns
bless
you
poor
sam
ca
do
impossibilities
no
this
money
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
sam
i
am
folding
it
up
and
giving
her
a
little
account
with
it
we
got
exactly
eleven
pounds
eleven
shillings
for
the
clothes
and
the
watch
and
chain
she
can
redeem
them
all
within
a
month
if
she
likes
here
is
the
pawnbroker
receipt
tell
her
to
keep
it
until
she
does
she
can
redeem
them
whenever
she
cares
to
pay
back
eleven
pounds
eleven
shillings
with
interest
my
commission
at
ten
per
cent
is
one
pound
three
shillings
and
tenpence
that
leaves
a
balance
of
ten
pounds
seven
shilling
and
twopence
it
will
doubtless
get
her
nicely
out
of
her
difficulty
she
ought
to
be
thankful
to
me
to
her
dying
day
look
here
elma
if
you
are
worried
about
things
and
i
can
guess
what
is
the
matter
pretty
well
for
i
happen
to
know
that
kitty
malone
made
a
clean
breast
of
your
secret
not
long
ago
you
will
be
glad
to
get
out
of
the
house
here
take
this
money
to
her
and
be
off
you
elma
still
did
not
speak
that
cold
stunned
feeling
was
pressing
round
her
heart
she
did
not
much
care
whether
she
was
in
the
house
or
not
just
at
that
moment
however
a
loud
slam
of
the
front
door
caused
both
the
girls
to
run
to
the
window
mrs
steward
had
sailed
down
the
steps
mrs
steward
with
her
long
train
streaming
behind
her
was
walking
up
constantine
road
the
next
instant
lewis
burst
into
the
room
well
elma
she
cried
this
is
a
pretty
state
of
things
your
aunt
has
told
me
everything
what
a
miserable
woman
i
am
please
do
scold
me
said
elma
i
have
had
enough
scolding
during
the
last
hour
to
last
me
my
life
say
what
you
like
to
me
but
your
aunt
says
she
washes
her
hands
of
you
how
are
you
to
be
educated
how
are
you
to
live
how
are
you
to
support
yourself
i
do
know
i
do
think
it
much
matters
do
talk
in
that
silly
way
elma
of
course
it
matters
she
says
too
that
you
are
to
be
publicly
exposed
at
middleton
school
and
your
conduct
i
must
say
i
could
not
make
out
what
she
was
talking
about
i
do
see
that
you
did
anything
very
wrong
but
your
conduct
is
to
be
proclaimed
to
the
school
and
that
you
are
to
be
if
not
expelled
something
like
it
elma
this
is
enough
to
take
all
my
senses
away
never
mind
now
mother
we
can
talk
it
all
over
presently
said
elma
give
me
the
money
carrie
and
let
me
go
carrie
handed
her
sister
the
little
parcel
without
a
word
elma
walked
slowly
out
of
the
room
a
moment
later
she
found
herself
on
the
dusty
road
she
reached
the
top
of
the
ugly
street
and
then
paused
to
look
around
her
to
her
right
lay
the
peaceful
valley
in
which
middleton
school
was
situated
a
little
further
away
was
the
open
country
beautiful
verdant
full
of
summer
splendor
gwin
harley
house
could
be
seen
in
the
distance
if
only
gwin
had
been
my
friend
this
morning
all
these
terrible
things
need
not
have
happened
thought
elma
i
have
nothing
to
thank
gwin
for
i
have
nothing
to
thank
kitty
for
i
am
a
miserable
forlorn
forsaken
girl
there
is
nothing
before
me
but
the
most
wretched
life
shall
i
go
to
see
kitty
does
kitty
deserve
anything
at
my
hands
i
have
got
ten
pounds
seven
shillings
and
twopence
in
my
pocket
why
should
i
not
go
right
away
with
the
money
i
do
think
kitty
would
prosecute
me
and
if
she
did
would
it
matter
i
am
so
hopeless
that
i
do
think
anything
much
worse
could
happen
to
me
i
know
i
could
not
stand
being
publicly
exposed
at
the
school
i
can
not
have
those
hundreds
of
eyes
fixed
on
me
i
who
have
always
been
looked
up
to
respected
who
belonged
to
the
society
i
can
not
can
not
bear
it
why
should
kitty
have
this
money
she
has
treated
me
badly
she
promised
not
to
tell
she
had
no
right
to
break
her
word
i
can
not
see
her
at
present
no
i
can
not
elma
walked
down
the
road
she
longed
beyond
words
to
get
into
a
fresh
place
to
be
where
there
was
no
chance
of
meeting
a
middleton
girl
she
walked
faster
and
faster
presently
she
found
herself
at
the
little
station
she
had
not
an
idea
where
to
go
nor
what
to
do
she
had
no
luggage
with
her
it
would
look
queer
her
going
away
without
even
a
handbag
it
would
look
very
much
as
if
she
were
running
away
all
the
girls
belonging
to
middleton
school
had
to
wear
a
badge
on
their
hats
and
elma
would
therefore
be
known
she
would
be
recognized
as
one
of
the
pupils
nevertheless
she
thought
she
would
risk
it
for
the
longing
to
go
away
got
stronger
and
stronger
the
railway
station
happened
to
be
rather
empty
at
this
time
she
looked
around
her
hastily
saw
no
one
that
she
knew
about
and
went
into
the
she
hastily
made
up
her
mind
to
take
a
ticket
for
a
large
seaport
town
a
few
miles
distant
she
asked
for
a
single
ticket
to
saltbury
inquired
when
the
next
train
came
up
and
a
few
moments
later
found
herself
on
the
right
platform
waiting
for
it
it
came
in
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
elma
took
her
seat
in
a
compartment
she
was
relieved
to
find
that
she
was
in
the
company
of
a
woman
who
was
just
returning
to
her
own
home
from
doing
some
marketing
at
middleton
she
did
not
take
any
notice
of
elma
who
crouched
up
in
the
opposite
corner
and
sat
looking
out
at
the
country
the
woman
left
the
carriage
at
the
next
station
and
elma
continued
her
journey
for
the
rest
of
the
way
alone
she
got
to
saltbury
within
an
hour
and
stepped
out
on
to
the
platform
she
had
been
at
saltbury
before
with
her
mother
and
carrie
they
had
once
spent
a
week
there
when
lewis
had
a
note
in
her
pocket
which
she
resolved
to
devote
to
a
treat
at
the
seaside
elma
wondered
if
she
might
venture
to
go
to
the
little
cottage
in
the
suburbs
of
saltbury
where
she
had
spent
this
week
after
reflection
however
she
thought
that
it
would
not
be
wise
to
venture
for
if
she
were
missed
it
would
be
very
easy
to
trace
her
to
saltbury
and
then
this
cottage
would
be
the
first
to
seek
for
her
in
accordingly
she
went
into
the
more
thronged
and
populous
part
of
the
town
the
expensive
season
had
not
yet
begun
and
she
presently
went
into
a
neat
little
house
with
apartments
written
on
a
card
in
the
window
she
asked
for
a
bed
for
the
night
the
landlady
a
young
woman
immediately
said
she
could
accommodate
her
and
took
elma
upstairs
to
the
top
of
the
house
to
show
her
a
neat
little
bedroom
you
can
have
this
for
half
a
crown
a
night
miss
she
said
are
you
likely
to
make
a
long
stay
i
do
know
answered
elma
i
ca
be
sure
i
want
the
room
for
one
night
and
then
i
let
you
know
very
well
miss
that
quite
satisfactory
and
i
can
get
in
anything
you
like
in
the
way
of
food
if
you
happened
to
wish
for
a
miss
oh
no
a
bedroom
will
be
enough
answered
elma
i
do
not
care
to
go
to
the
expense
of
a
you
left
your
luggage
i
suppose
miss
at
the
railway
station
elma
colored
and
then
turned
pale
no
she
said
i
have
not
brought
any
luggage
with
me
the
woman
stared
opening
her
eyes
very
wide
now
giving
elma
a
full
and
particular
attention
which
she
had
not
hitherto
vouchsafed
to
her
she
said
nothing
further
and
elma
went
downstairs
i
go
down
to
the
beach
for
a
little
she
said
you
might
have
some
tea
ready
for
me
when
i
come
back
i
am
very
tired
and
should
like
some
tea
and
toast
and
a
hegg
miss
or
anything
of
that
sort
no
thank
you
just
tea
and
toast
please
nothing
more
the
woman
stared
after
her
as
she
went
down
the
street
elma
got
as
far
as
the
beach
she
then
sat
down
on
a
bench
and
gazed
out
at
the
waves
the
tide
was
coming
in
the
beach
at
saltbury
was
celebrated
and
children
were
playing
about
amusing
themselves
gathering
shells
making
and
otherwise
disporting
themselves
after
the
manner
of
their
kind
a
little
boy
was
wading
far
out
elma
watched
him
with
eyes
she
wondered
vaguely
how
long
he
would
be
allowed
to
wade
and
how
deep
he
might
go
he
got
as
far
as
his
knees
and
then
turned
back
as
he
was
going
back
he
fell
wetting
himself
and
crying
out
lustily
elma
continued
to
gaze
at
him
with
eyes
which
scarcely
saw
he
thinks
he
is
hurt
she
said
to
herself
that
he
has
had
a
terrible
misfortune
how
little
he
knows
what
real
pain
means
and
what
real
misfortune
is
here
am
i
with
money
in
my
pocket
which
does
not
belong
to
me
having
run
away
from
home
disgraced
for
life
miserable
for
life
oh
what
shall
i
do
it
had
been
a
very
hot
day
but
the
evening
was
chilly
and
elma
shivered
as
she
went
back
to
her
lodgings
in
south
street
she
had
brought
away
no
wraps
with
her
and
her
thin
cotton
dress
was
not
sufficient
to
keep
out
the
chill
of
the
sea
breezes
she
thought
she
would
be
glad
to
get
under
shelter
to
go
to
bed
to
wrap
herself
up
and
cover
her
face
and
court
sleep
when
she
got
to
the
door
however
the
young
landlady
who
was
evidently
waiting
for
her
came
out
on
to
the
steps
if
you
please
miss
she
said
i
am
really
very
sorry
but
my
husband
thinks
what
said
elma
that
as
you
have
no
luggage
miss
you
know
it
ai
customary
for
us
to
take
in
ladies
without
luggage
then
you
mean
said
elma
turning
very
white
and
pale
yes
miss
i
ever
so
sorry
you
ca
give
me
the
room
even
for
one
night
we
ca
really
miss
but
i
can
pay
in
advance
said
elma
eagerly
i
ever
so
sorry
miss
but
another
lady
came
just
as
you
left
and
she
had
a
box
and
a
handbag
and
everything
proper
and
as
she
wanted
the
room
very
badly
and
as
we
had
her
before
we
have
let
it
to
her
miss
i
am
sure
i
am
very
sorry
not
to
oblige
but
i
dare
say
there
are
a
great
many
other
apartments
down
this
road
miss
thank
you
said
elma
it
does
not
matter
at
all
she
spoke
with
a
voice
of
ice
pride
a
remnant
of
pride
came
to
her
aid
she
would
not
let
the
woman
see
how
distressed
she
was
miss
said
the
young
landlady
i
real
sorry
not
to
oblige
oh
it
does
matter
said
elma
i
dare
say
i
can
manage
she
walked
down
south
street
knowing
that
the
landlady
was
watching
her
as
she
disappeared
she
soon
came
to
a
corner
where
four
roads
met
where
should
she
go
what
could
she
do
where
was
she
to
have
shelter
for
the
night
it
occurred
to
her
that
after
all
there
was
nothing
now
left
to
her
but
to
return
to
middleton
she
hurried
up
to
the
railway
station
and
asked
when
the
next
train
would
start
a
porter
who
was
standing
just
inside
the
station
informed
her
that
the
last
train
for
middleton
had
left
five
minutes
ago
the
next
will
be
at
seven
morning
he
said
thank
you
answered
elma
she
would
not
allow
any
of
the
dismay
on
her
face
to
appear
after
all
it
is
too
absurd
that
i
ca
have
shelter
she
said
to
herself
when
i
have
over
ten
pounds
in
my
pocket
what
can
the
landlady
have
meant
surely
if
i
pay
my
way
that
is
all
that
is
necessary
but
all
the
same
she
did
not
like
to
go
and
inquire
at
any
other
lodging
she
could
not
stand
meeting
once
again
the
stony
stare
of
a
landlady
when
she
explained
that
she
had
no
luggage
none
at
all
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
might
go
into
a
shop
and
buy
some
and
a
small
handbag
but
she
rejected
the
idea
almost
as
quickly
as
it
came
to
her
it
would
only
waste
the
money
she
said
to
herself
and
where
is
the
use
i
suppose
i
can
manage
to
spend
the
night
somewhere
thank
goodness
it
is
a
fine
summer
night
i
might
do
worse
than
spend
it
in
the
open
air
she
wandered
away
and
presently
passing
a
small
restaurant
went
in
and
ordered
a
cup
of
tea
for
herself
and
some
bread
and
butter
she
drank
the
tea
but
found
that
to
eat
choked
her
the
outlook
before
her
was
more
miserable
moment
by
moment
she
was
driven
to
such
despair
that
it
seemed
of
very
little
consequence
to
her
whether
she
succeeded
in
getting
away
from
middleton
school
from
the
censorious
eyes
of
the
whole
of
her
world
or
not
everything
was
up
with
her
she
kept
repeating
that
moodily
drearily
under
her
breath
everything
was
up
she
had
not
a
friend
in
the
wide
wide
world
having
finished
her
meager
meal
she
went
out
again
into
south
street
she
was
horrified
when
she
saw
the
name
at
one
end
of
the
street
she
did
not
want
to
pass
by
that
neat
little
house
which
contained
that
snug
little
bedroom
where
she
had
hoped
to
cover
her
eyes
from
the
light
and
court
sleep
in
order
to
get
rid
of
her
misery
for
a
few
hours
she
had
now
reached
the
neighborhood
of
the
shore
the
tide
was
nearly
full
in
the
great
broad
expanse
of
beach
was
covered
the
children
had
all
gone
home
to
supper
and
to
bed
the
stars
were
coming
out
in
the
sky
a
full
moon
was
riding
in
majesty
across
the
heavens
it
seemed
to
elma
fine
as
the
night
was
that
the
sea
moaned
in
an
unreasonable
and
very
dreadful
manner
she
had
to
press
her
hands
to
her
ears
to
shut
away
the
sound
of
that
moaning
sea
she
determined
to
go
inland
there
was
plenty
of
time
plenty
she
could
get
back
to
the
station
by
seven
in
the
morning
wait
for
the
first
train
which
returned
to
middleton
and
reach
the
school
after
all
in
time
for
her
exposure
she
turned
her
steps
now
countrywise
and
after
walking
for
a
mile
or
two
found
that
she
was
too
weary
to
go
any
further
she
crept
inside
a
narrow
opening
in
a
hedge
and
got
into
a
field
here
she
was
absolutely
alone
not
a
human
being
was
in
sight
as
far
as
she
could
tell
there
was
not
a
living
creature
near
she
felt
the
grass
it
was
heavy
with
dew
she
had
always
heard
that
it
was
very
dangerous
to
sit
down
on
grass
soaked
with
dew
but
danger
now
was
of
no
moment
to
her
it
would
be
rather
nice
to
be
ill
it
would
be
rather
nice
to
die
she
had
nothing
left
to
live
for
her
whole
life
had
been
a
mistake
she
had
tried
hard
to
get
away
from
her
own
set
the
set
in
which
she
was
born
she
had
made
a
mess
of
it
she
had
failed
her
own
set
the
the
vulgar
the
low
were
the
only
ones
who
could
claim
her
who
could
touch
her
who
could
have
anything
in
common
with
her
how
terribly
shocked
miss
sherrard
had
been
at
what
she
had
done
how
disgusted
how
coldly
terribly
cruel
aunt
charlotte
had
been
but
her
mother
had
thought
very
little
about
it
and
carrie
would
love
her
just
as
much
after
her
disgraceful
conduct
as
she
had
done
before
i
belong
to
them
and
they
belong
to
me
thought
poor
elma
my
ambitions
were
wrong
i
shall
sink
now
and
become
a
second
carrie
no
i
shall
never
marry
a
sam
raynes
but
i
shall
become
a
sour
old
maid
perhaps
i
shall
do
charring
some
day
there
is
no
saying
i
did
wrong
to
try
to
raise
myself
i
she
never
saw
where
her
fault
lay
she
was
not
really
repentant
for
her
the
consequences
were
terrible
but
the
sin
did
not
trouble
her
after
a
time
terribly
exhausted
and
weary
she
lay
down
just
as
she
was
on
the
soaking
wet
grass
and
fell
asleep
she
had
been
chilled
and
tired
before
she
slept
but
when
in
the
very
middle
of
the
night
she
awoke
she
had
never
known
anything
like
the
bitter
cold
which
she
experienced
she
could
not
at
first
remember
where
she
was
but
all
too
soon
memory
with
a
flash
returned
to
her
she
remembered
all
the
events
of
yesterday
she
knew
that
she
was
a
runaway
that
she
had
stolen
money
in
her
pocket
she
might
be
arrested
and
put
in
prison
there
was
no
saying
what
awful
fate
lay
before
her
in
the
dead
of
night
lying
there
she
became
really
frightened
she
almost
felt
as
if
she
could
scream
aloud
in
her
terror
how
empty
the
world
seemed
how
hollow
she
wished
the
stars
overhead
would
not
blink
at
her
she
wished
the
moon
would
go
behind
a
cloud
she
felt
as
if
god
himself
was
looking
at
her
through
the
face
of
the
moon
and
she
did
not
like
it
she
covered
her
face
with
her
cold
and
trembling
hands
and
tried
to
shut
away
what
she
felt
might
be
the
face
of
god
himself
i
have
been
a
very
wicked
girl
she
moaned
and
now
for
the
first
time
she
thought
not
so
much
of
the
consequences
as
of
the
sin
tears
rained
from
her
eyes
she
sat
up
and
covered
her
face
god
help
me
please
god
do
be
too
angry
with
me
i
am
the
most
miserable
girl
in
the
world
she
faltered
after
that
frightened
cry
or
prayer
she
felt
more
comfortable
and
now
staggering
to
her
feet
she
saw
standing
about
ten
yards
away
and
looking
at
her
fixedly
out
of
its
large
and
luminous
eyes
a
brown
cow
there
were
several
more
cows
in
the
field
and
this
one
had
come
up
and
was
gazing
inquiringly
at
her
the
motherly
creature
could
not
imagine
what
desolate
and
queer
young
thing
this
was
up
and
awake
in
the
middle
of
the
night
such
creatures
as
elma
in
the
cow
experience
were
not
to
be
seen
at
these
inclement
hours
it
lashed
its
long
tail
slowly
from
side
to
side
and
kept
gazing
at
her
and
elma
looked
at
it
and
her
nervous
terrors
grew
worse
the
cow
had
horns
suppose
it
came
near
and
tried
to
horn
her
she
was
not
a
country
girl
and
did
not
understand
country
creatures
a
bitter
cry
of
abject
terror
rose
from
her
lips
she
darted
past
the
animal
rushed
out
by
the
way
she
had
come
into
the
field
and
found
herself
once
more
on
the
highroad
the
cow
its
curiosity
very
faintly
tickled
by
the
appearance
of
elma
on
the
scene
placidly
resumed
its
feeding
and
the
terrified
girl
ran
as
if
she
had
wings
to
her
feet
up
the
highroad
in
after
days
she
was
never
able
to
tell
how
she
spent
the
remainder
of
that
night
but
the
longest
hours
only
herald
in
the
dawn
and
at
last
the
sun
arose
and
the
worst
of
her
fears
were
over
the
sun
warmed
her
and
took
away
the
dreadful
feeling
of
chill
which
she
was
experiencing
she
wandered
about
sitting
down
now
and
then
too
feeble
too
tired
too
utterly
depressed
to
have
room
even
for
active
fears
and
at
last
the
time
came
when
she
might
again
present
herself
at
the
station
chapter
xxiv
sunshine
again
when
carrie
left
her
kitty
malone
was
buoyed
up
with
a
certain
degree
of
hope
carrie
had
spoken
with
confidence
she
had
assured
her
that
her
clothes
were
worth
money
never
before
much
as
she
prized
pretty
things
had
they
seemed
so
valuable
in
poor
kitty
eyes
if
carrie
would
really
keep
her
word
it
would
be
possible
for
kitty
to
send
laurie
the
money
which
he
wanted
that
evening
could
she
do
this
her
worst
anxieties
would
be
laid
to
rest
and
she
felt
that
it
would
be
even
possible
for
her
to
try
to
be
good
once
more
as
things
were
at
present
she
cared
nothing
at
all
about
being
either
good
or
bad
every
thought
of
her
mind
was
fixed
upon
laurie
if
he
were
saved
she
would
be
good
if
not
if
he
indeed
the
darling
of
her
heart
went
to
the
dogs
nothing
mattered
kitty
was
too
restless
and
miserable
to
go
down
to
the
rest
of
the
family
she
walked
up
and
down
up
and
down
her
bedroom
watching
and
longing
for
carrie
now
and
then
she
would
rush
to
the
window
putting
out
her
head
and
shoulders
and
half
her
body
to
watch
if
by
any
chance
carrie
might
be
coming
up
the
street
that
fat
young
woman
now
represented
all
kitty
hopes
when
darkness
set
in
however
when
the
hours
first
struck
nine
and
then
ten
poor
kitty
gradually
saw
the
last
star
in
her
firmament
expire
without
doubt
carrie
had
failed
to
pawn
the
things
and
i
thought
them
so
good
whispered
kitty
to
herself
aunt
bridget
would
be
sure
to
choose
nice
and
expensive
things
perhaps
they
were
too
good
for
the
people
who
come
to
the
pawnbroker
for
their
clothes
that
must
be
the
reason
but
i
wonder
carrie
did
not
come
back
to
tell
me
presently
alice
bustled
into
the
room
and
opening
the
door
of
the
large
wardrobe
which
the
girls
shared
between
them
began
to
make
active
search
for
a
neat
little
jacket
which
she
wanted
to
put
on
she
was
going
out
for
the
evening
and
wished
to
wear
it
when
she
was
returning
home
search
as
she
would
however
she
could
not
find
it
and
presently
turned
to
ask
kitty
if
she
had
seen
it
dear
me
no
answered
kitty
starting
and
blushing
is
it
not
in
the
wardrobe
no
replied
alice
and
i
remember
i
hung
it
on
this
peg
where
can
it
possibly
have
disappeared
to
do
you
know
anything
about
it
kitty
by
the
way
how
wonderfully
empty
the
wardrobe
looks
have
you
been
putting
your
clothes
back
into
your
boxes
kitty
who
had
been
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
looking
the
very
picture
of
despair
now
burst
into
a
hearty
peal
of
laughter
what
are
you
laughing
about
asked
alice
i
am
awfully
afraid
it
has
happened
she
cried
what
do
you
mean
why
that
your
jacket
has
gone
to
the
pawn
kitty
cried
alice
looking
at
the
irish
girl
in
some
alarm
have
you
gone
mad
no
alice
but
i
am
dreadfully
afraid
all
the
same
that
it
has
happened
indeed
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
it
kitty
laughed
again
she
often
cried
when
she
laughed
and
now
the
tears
ran
down
her
cheeks
well
this
is
too
funny
she
gasped
between
her
paroxysms
of
mirth
i
do
think
it
funny
at
all
i
think
you
must
have
taken
leave
of
your
senses
kitty
please
explain
yourself
i
will
try
to
alice
oh
do
frown
at
me
so
horribly
or
i
shall
go
off
into
fits
of
laughter
again
this
is
the
simple
truth
i
wanted
money
very
very
badly
i
could
not
get
it
and
carrie
lewis
carrie
lewis
who
is
she
asked
alice
oh
do
be
so
ridiculous
alice
of
course
you
know
who
carrie
lewis
is
she
is
elma
sister
she
came
here
how
very
interesting
what
a
nice
set
of
people
you
seem
to
be
getting
to
know
i
was
aware
that
you
were
acquainted
with
any
of
the
lewises
except
elma
well
i
am
acquainted
with
carrie
now
and
i
rather
like
her
she
is
great
fun
much
more
fun
than
you
are
she
is
vulgar
of
course
but
really
that
does
not
matter
she
called
to
see
me
and
as
i
happened
to
want
money
she
suggested
pawning
some
of
my
things
for
me
i
conclude
she
took
your
jacket
by
mistake
with
the
rest
alice
was
so
stunned
absolutely
by
this
news
that
no
words
would
come
to
her
she
stared
at
kitty
her
face
growing
whiter
and
more
each
moment
then
without
vouchsafing
a
syllable
of
reply
she
left
the
room
banging
the
door
behind
her
there
i
have
given
her
a
good
settler
thought
kitty
and
for
a
moment
the
feeling
that
alice
was
as
uncomfortable
as
she
was
herself
gave
her
a
certain
sense
of
satisfaction
the
last
post
brought
a
letter
from
laurie
it
was
brief
and
was
written
in
frantic
hurry
and
despair
my
dear
kitty
wrote
the
boy
what
has
come
to
you
i
am
looking
for
a
letter
by
every
post
but
none
arrives
i
shall
not
be
able
to
give
the
money
i
promised
him
on
saturday
and
i
know
he
will
not
keep
my
secret
any
longer
when
father
hears
it
all
is
up
if
i
receive
that
money
by
saturday
morning
i
shall
run
away
to
laurie
the
letter
fluttered
from
poor
kitty
fingers
to
the
floor
she
felt
stunned
there
was
a
cold
weight
now
at
her
heart
which
made
it
almost
impossible
for
her
to
move
or
even
think
if
laurie
did
not
get
the
money
by
saturday
morning
he
would
run
away
to
sea
this
was
thursday
evening
there
was
still
time
just
time
to
save
him
oh
if
only
carrie
would
come
how
dreadful
how
terrible
of
her
to
fail
kitty
at
such
a
moment
as
this
laurie
was
just
the
sort
of
boy
to
do
what
he
said
the
longing
to
go
to
sea
had
been
one
of
the
innermost
cravings
of
his
heart
for
many
years
if
he
did
so
the
squire
would
never
forgive
him
his
career
would
be
ruined
bad
and
awful
as
an
english
school
in
kitty
opinion
would
be
the
fate
which
he
now
had
mapped
out
for
himself
would
be
much
worse
the
cruel
cruel
sea
might
even
drown
him
kitty
might
never
behold
her
laurie
again
he
was
the
joy
of
her
heart
and
the
light
of
her
eyes
she
uttered
a
piercing
cry
and
fell
down
by
her
bedside
she
lay
so
for
the
greater
part
of
an
hour
then
struggling
to
her
feet
got
into
bed
without
undressing
and
pulled
the
bedclothes
well
over
her
head
when
alice
came
in
very
late
that
evening
she
thought
that
kitty
was
asleep
and
did
not
disturb
her
but
all
during
the
long
hours
of
that
miserable
night
poor
kitty
lay
awake
her
heart
beating
loud
terrible
visions
passing
before
her
eyes
toward
morning
she
fell
into
a
troubled
sleep
to
awake
again
quite
early
her
head
ached
badly
her
pulses
beat
too
quickly
she
could
not
stand
her
hot
bed
any
longer
springing
up
she
went
into
the
bathroom
turned
on
the
cold
water
and
refreshed
herself
with
a
bath
she
felt
really
desperate
and
quite
impervious
to
all
ideas
of
discipline
she
made
up
her
mind
to
go
to
the
lewises
knock
up
carrie
and
demand
an
account
of
the
property
which
she
had
confided
to
her
on
the
previous
day
even
still
there
was
just
just
time
to
save
laurie
for
if
she
could
catch
the
early
post
he
would
receive
his
money
on
saturday
morning
kitty
found
herself
at
constantino
road
between
seven
and
eight
the
blinds
of
carrie
bedroom
window
were
still
down
for
the
lewises
were
not
early
risers
maggie
however
was
up
and
when
kitty
rang
the
bell
she
opened
the
door
for
her
miss
malone
she
cried
i
want
to
see
miss
carrie
at
once
cried
kitty
is
she
up
maggie
not
she
miss
she
sound
asleep
and
in
bed
but
i
run
up
and
tell
her
that
you
are
here
please
come
into
the
miss
malone
maggie
threw
open
the
door
of
this
luxurious
apartment
and
then
ran
upstairs
to
inform
carrie
of
kitty
unexpected
arrival
now
what
can
be
up
thought
carrie
surely
she
is
satisfied
i
did
very
well
for
her
she
dressed
herself
hastily
and
in
five
minutes
was
standing
by
side
what
is
it
she
asked
are
you
not
pleased
elma
took
you
the
money
did
she
not
she
must
have
stayed
with
one
of
the
middleton
school
girls
for
the
night
for
she
never
returned
home
but
she
took
you
the
money
i
thought
i
did
very
well
by
you
were
you
not
satisfied
she
took
me
the
money
cried
kitty
turning
pale
no
that
she
did
not
i
never
had
any
money
what
do
you
mean
carrie
what
i
say
answered
carrie
oh
do
sit
down
kitty
you
look
quite
ghastly
i
gave
elma
ten
pounds
seven
shillings
and
twopence
to
give
you
i
got
eleven
guineas
for
your
things
including
the
watch
and
chain
after
i
deducted
my
ten
per
the
balance
for
you
was
ten
pounds
seven
and
twopence
i
thought
you
would
be
delighted
did
she
not
take
you
the
money
early
yesterday
evening
no
i
have
never
seen
her
but
she
left
here
quite
early
on
purpose
she
said
she
was
going
straight
to
your
house
i
sent
you
plenty
of
money
did
i
not
how
much
did
you
say
asked
kitty
putting
her
hand
up
to
her
forehead
in
a
distracted
way
ten
pounds
seven
and
twopence
you
only
really
wanted
eight
pounds
did
you
not
i
had
a
little
money
of
my
own
and
eight
pounds
would
have
done
said
kitty
in
a
low
voice
but
here
she
sprang
forward
and
gripped
carrie
by
the
arm
what
does
it
mean
carrie
what
does
it
mean
elma
never
came
near
me
i
never
never
saw
her
last
night
you
never
saw
her
elma
never
went
to
you
no
never
do
you
think
i
would
tell
an
untruth
i
never
saw
her
not
since
early
school
yesterday
oh
carrie
tell
me
what
it
means
i
can
not
i
must
say
it
looks
very
queer
said
carrie
she
frowned
turned
her
back
partly
upon
kitty
and
supporting
her
fat
chin
on
one
of
her
dimpled
hands
began
to
think
deeply
the
more
she
thought
the
less
she
liked
the
aspect
of
affairs
carrie
what
does
it
mean
cried
kitty
reiterating
her
words
in
a
kind
of
frenzy
of
agitation
oh
stop
talking
to
me
for
a
minute
kitty
i
must
think
this
out
carrie
walked
to
the
window
pulled
up
the
blinds
threw
the
sash
up
and
allowed
the
fresh
morning
air
to
blow
upon
her
hot
face
after
a
time
she
turned
round
and
faced
kitty
you
may
well
look
pale
she
said
i
confess
i
am
as
bewildered
as
you
are
yourself
of
course
elma
may
have
been
taken
ill
she
had
a
dreadful
shock
yesterday
how
you
are
silly
to
talk
like
that
do
you
know
you
mean
because
i
told
about
her
well
it
turned
out
very
badly
as
badly
as
possible
you
did
tell
and
when
you
did
so
you
ruined
her
if
you
had
only
kept
that
precious
story
to
yourself
even
for
hours
little
elma
would
have
been
made
made
for
life
but
you
ruined
her
oh
do
please
tell
me
what
you
mean
my
head
is
going
round
in
a
whirl
i
can
scarcely
follow
you
you
can
pull
yourself
together
if
you
like
this
is
what
happened
i
told
you
did
i
not
yesterday
that
aunt
charlotte
pays
elma
fees
at
middleton
school
i
think
so
but
i
do
quite
remember
that
is
so
like
you
i
always
said
you
were
selfish
think
what
you
like
carrie
but
please
tell
me
everything
oh
i
quite
willing
this
is
the
story
aunt
charlotte
came
here
yesterday
she
had
heard
of
a
splendid
school
in
germany
where
elma
was
to
be
sent
as
she
wanted
elma
to
leave
middleton
school
at
once
as
she
had
found
an
escort
to
take
her
to
germany
but
before
elma
could
be
admitted
into
this
new
school
it
was
necessary
for
her
to
have
a
certificate
from
miss
sherrard
now
you
see
daylight
do
you
my
aunt
mrs
steward
went
to
see
miss
sherrard
taking
elma
with
her
elma
did
not
know
that
you
had
put
a
match
to
the
mine
and
of
course
aunt
charlotte
knew
nothing
about
it
when
miss
sherrard
was
asked
to
give
elma
a
certificate
for
conduct
she
refused
of
course
the
mine
exploded
elma
was
called
in
and
all
your
nice
miserable
story
told
to
aunt
charlotte
elma
is
to
be
publicly
exposed
at
middleton
school
and
aunt
charlotte
has
washed
her
hands
of
her
forever
there
that
what
you
have
done
we
have
much
to
thank
you
for
have
we
not
kitty
face
had
grown
whiter
and
whiter
you
blame
me
very
much
for
what
i
am
not
to
be
blamed
for
she
said
after
a
pause
that
what
you
think
you
an
irish
girl
and
you
think
nothing
of
a
promise
you
promised
elma
you
would
not
tell
you
lent
her
the
money
and
you
promised
you
would
not
tell
about
it
you
broke
your
promise
and
you
have
ruined
her
for
life
there
that
what
has
happened
i
wish
you
joy
of
the
nice
state
your
conscience
must
be
in
you
are
very
bitter
to
me
carrie
but
you
can
not
quite
see
my
side
of
the
question
i
would
not
have
told
about
elma
if
elma
had
been
in
the
least
true
to
me
but
she
was
not
not
a
bit
all
the
same
i
am
terribly
terribly
sorry
for
her
i
would
not
have
got
her
into
this
scrape
if
i
had
known
ay
you
had
no
thought
you
see
you
just
blurted
out
everything
i
am
very
miserable
said
poor
kitty
she
clasped
her
trembling
hands
together
and
tears
slowly
welled
into
her
beautiful
eyes
carrie
watched
her
with
anxiety
there
now
i
like
you
she
said
after
a
pause
you
look
awfully
pretty
with
those
tears
in
your
eyes
and
pretty
do
i
said
kitty
for
a
moment
a
pleased
smile
flitted
across
her
face
but
then
it
faded
the
present
anxiety
was
too
intense
for
her
to
give
much
thought
to
her
personal
appearance
where
can
elma
be
she
said
ah
that
the
dreadful
part
i
do
know
she
went
out
of
the
house
with
your
money
she
evidently
never
took
it
to
you
i
am
sure
i
can
not
think
what
has
happened
to
her
and
my
money
is
gone
said
kitty
so
it
seems
that
is
unless
we
can
find
elma
it
is
all
very
dreadful
very
horrible
i
suppose
the
plain
english
of
the
matter
is
this
here
carrie
gulped
something
down
in
her
throat
that
she
she
stole
your
money
and
has
run
away
with
it
carrie
you
can
not
think
so
it
is
what
i
have
to
think
answered
carrie
it
is
a
mighty
unpalatable
truth
i
can
tell
you
i
suppose
now
your
next
step
will
be
to
prosecute
her
to
send
the
police
after
her
and
have
her
locked
up
then
you
will
ruin
me
too
for
sam
raynes
not
that
he
is
overparticular
nor
that
he
cares
twopence
about
refinement
or
anything
of
that
sort
would
not
care
to
marry
a
girl
whose
whose
sister
was
put
in
prison
that
your
next
step
is
it
kitty
malone
i
wo
stop
to
listen
to
you
said
kitty
you
are
too
terrible
she
ran
to
the
door
opened
it
and
the
next
moment
found
herself
in
the
street
she
walked
fast
ugly
words
repeating
themselves
in
her
ears
carrie
had
been
very
blunt
and
had
given
the
petted
girl
some
home
truths
to
think
about
had
she
really
been
unkind
in
telling
about
elma
oh
what
was
right
and
what
was
wrong
what
was
the
matter
could
she
ever
ever
in
the
whole
course
of
her
existence
have
a
light
heart
again
she
walked
up
the
street
little
caring
what
she
was
doing
or
where
she
was
going
at
the
next
corner
she
came
plump
upon
elma
herself
who
was
coming
slowly
very
slowly
in
the
direction
of
constantine
road
when
she
saw
her
poor
kitty
gave
a
sudden
shout
oh
elma
she
said
how
glad
i
am
how
glad
i
am
what
do
you
mean
said
elma
her
voice
was
faint
i
thought
i
might
never
see
you
again
i
thought
i
do
know
what
i
thought
but
you
have
come
back
i
ran
away
and
i
have
come
back
again
said
elma
you
can
punish
me
if
you
like
kitty
things
can
never
be
much
worse
than
they
are
here
she
staggered
and
would
have
fallen
had
not
kitty
held
her
up
how
dreadfully
bad
you
look
but
oh
the
relief
of
seeing
you
again
said
kitty
where
have
you
been
what
have
you
done
i
scarcely
know
what
i
have
done
or
where
i
have
been
i
have
a
noise
in
my
head
a
queer
noise
my
head
aches
so
badly
it
seems
as
if
it
would
never
leave
off
again
i
am
going
to
school
and
they
are
going
to
expose
me
it
was
all
because
you
told
kitty
and
here
is
nearly
all
your
money
elm
a
put
her
hand
into
her
pocket
i
must
tell
you
everything
kitty
for
nothing
really
matters
now
i
meant
to
take
that
money
i
meant
to
steal
it
all
but
when
it
came
to
the
point
i
found
i
could
not
here
is
most
of
it
back
i
spent
three
shillings
on
my
fare
to
saltbury
and
back
and
sixpence
on
tea
last
night
that
leaves
ten
pounds
three
and
eightpence
here
count
it
wo
you
kitty
take
it
in
your
hand
here
are
the
ten
sovereigns
and
the
three
shillings
and
the
sixpence
and
twopence
have
you
got
them
all
right
i
must
owe
you
the
balance
but
i
pay
you
soon
soon
elma
voice
sounded
weaker
and
weaker
kitty
clasped
the
money
her
small
fingers
closed
over
it
her
eyes
grew
bright
a
flaming
color
rose
into
each
of
her
cheeks
and
it
was
as
if
new
life
was
put
into
her
how
bad
you
look
she
cried
but
oh
how
happy
i
am
to
have
this
money

a
moment

you
meant
to
do

and

as
possible
here
elma
come
into
the
restaurant
and
wait
kitty
had
clutched
hold
of
elma
arm
and
now
she
dragged
her
into
a
large
restaurant
which
they
were
just
passing
the
next
moment
elma
found
herself
seated
by
a
small
marble
table
kitty
was
ordering
tea
or
something
elma
could
not
quite
make
out
what
nor
did
she
care
everything
was
dreamy
and
unreal
to
her
i
be
back
in
a
minute
elma
cried
kitty
her
flashing
eyes
smiled
as
they
glanced
at
elma
elma
tried
to
smile
back
but
could
not
the
next
moment
kitty
was
out
of
the
place
she
was
back
again
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
have
done
it
she
cried
and
my
heart
is
as
light
as
a
feather
i
have
sent
off
the
postal
order
to
laurie
he
will
be
saved

so
comforting
and
we

a
little
over
two
pounds
for
ourselves

ourselves

elma
why
of
course

divide
it
and
have
a
jolly
time
are
you
going
to
have
your
breakfast
i
as
hungry
as
a
hawk
as
kitty
spoke
she
poured
out
a
cup
of
tea
added
milk
to
it
and
pushed
it
toward
elma
elma
drank
it
off
and
when
she
had
done
so
the
confused
feeling
in
her
head
got
a
little
better
kitty
then
began
to
speak
in
a
low
excited
whisper
let
us
do
something
she
said
let
us
do
something
quite
mad
and
wild
and
jolly
we
have
got
out
of
our
scrape
you
have
but
i
am
in
it
up
to
my
neck

be
a
jolly
girl

you
think
because

am
happy
again
that

am
going
to
leave

all
this
misery
particularly
after
that
nice
blunt
determined
carrie
of
yours
telling
me
that
it
was
my
fault
and
that
i
would
repent
it
to

elma
her
eyes
sparkling
kitty
it
is
wonderful
of
you

me
up
oh

am
not
the
sort
of
girl
to
give
up
a
friend
when

is
in
trouble
you
have
made
it
right
for
me
and

sun

shining
again
and
i

sound
tempting
i
wish

not
ache
so
badly

be
better
when

the
seaside
perhaps
so
and
then

us
go
to
the
railway
station
it
is
not
far
off
kitty
eager
and
impetuous
words
earned
the
day
and
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
time
the
girls
found
themselves
speeding
away
to
saltbury
we
have
indeed
burned
our
boats
now
said
kitty
with
a
laugh
we
have
both
run
away
now
they
have
something
really
to
scold
us
about
but
never
mind
i
never
felt
more
jolly
in
my
life
chapter
xxv
kitty
forever
but
kitty
happiness
was
very
for
long
before
they
got
to
saltbury
elma
was
really
so
ill
that
she
could
not
hold
up
her
head
kitty
had
never
seen
such
severe
illness
before
she
was
not
easily
frightened
she
had
plenty
of
pluck
when
a
real
emergency
arose
and
she
now
determined
to
do
her
best
for
her
companion
it
is
all
the
worry
and
the
misery
she
has
undergone
thought
kitty
to
herself
but
now
that
my
mind
is
at
rest
she
will
see
what
a
good
friend
i
can
be
to
her
when
they
got
to
saltbury
she
immediately
ordered
a
cab
and
desired
the
man
to
drive
her
to
the
nearest
hotel
oh
kitty
gasped
poor
elma
they
wo
take
us
in
because
we
have
no
luggage
you
know
i
manage
it
said
kitty
no
luggage
what
does
that
matter
she
followed
elma
into
the
cab
and
a
few
moments
later
the
girls
found
themselves
at
the
door
of
a
neat
little
inn
facing
the
sea
kitty
jumped
out
and
went
straight
to
the
bar
i
want
a
nice
quiet
bedroom
she
said
with
two
beds
in
it
certainly
miss
said
the
woman
glancing
into
kitty
bright
face
it
must
be
a
very
quiet
room
continued
kitty
for
my
companion
is
ill
she
has
a
bad
headache
and
we
must
send
for
a
doctor
immediately
yes
miss
i
send
the
porter
out
to
bring
in
your
luggage
that
the
annoying
part
said
kitty
we
have
no
luggage
the
woman
looked
dubious
and
turned
to
glance
at
a
man
who
approached
two
young
ladies
want
a
room
she
said
in
a
low
voice
one
of
them
is
ill
and
they
have
no
luggage
then
in
that
case
miss
i
am
very
sorry
began
the
man
but
kitty
interrupted
him
do
say
those
words
she
began
i
know
exactly
what
you
are
going
to
say
but
please
do
we
have
no
luggage
for
we
we
have
run
away
from
school
there
now
i
have
confided
in
you
here
father
card
he
will
be
responsible
for
us
please
show
us
to
your
very
best
room
immediately
as
kitty
spoke
she
took
a
card
out
of
her
sealskin
purse
and
handed
it
to
the
woman
dennis
malone
castle
malone
county
donegal
was
inscribed
on
the
small
piece
of
pasteboard
it
evidently
had
a
good
effect
but
a
still
greater
effect
was
produced
by
the
sparkling
and
lovely
eyes
of
the
handsome
girl
who
spoke
in
a
tone
of
quiet
assurance
father
will
be
so
grateful
to
you
for
taking
us
in
she
continued
it
would
be
terrible
you
know
if
you
allowed
us
to
wander
about
the
streets
i
am
going
to
telegraph
to
him
now
and
he
will
arrive
here
i
have
no
doubt
within
the
next
hours
i
have
not
much
money
with
me
added
kitty
frankly
but
father
will
bring
plenty
plenty
when
he
arrives
again
the
man
and
woman
whispered
together
and
now
approving
and
interesting
glances
turned
in
kitty
direction
the
woman
presently
said
very
well
miss
we
do
our
best
for
you
will
you
follow
me
miss
she
took
kitty
and
elma
upstairs
and
showed
them
into
the
best
room
in
the
house
in
a
very
short
time
poor
elma
found
herself
in
bed
with
kitty
bending
over
her
kissing
her
now
and
then
and
whispering
kind
words
in
her
ears
i
have
managed
beautifully
with
the
people
of
the
hotel
whispered
kitty
and
now
darling
you
be
made
so
comfortable
i
am
going
to
make
up
to
you
for
for
what
carrie
said
i
did
but
you
did
nothing
it
was
i
who
was
bad
very
bad
cried
elma
oh
do
begin
to
get
remorseful
now
while
you
are
ill
wait
at
least
until
you
are
better
i
have
ordered
some
fruit
and
jelly
and
ice
and
i
have
asked
the
landlady
is
she
a
dear
to
send
for
the
doctor
it
seems
like
a
dream
said
elma
is
it
possible
that
everything
has
changed
so
completely
and
you
you
kitty
malone
you
to
whom
i
have
acted
so
badly
are
good
to
me
yes
yes
i
mean
to
be
good
to
you
but
do
begin
to
fret
about
your
sins
until
you
are
better
leave
unpleasant
things
alone
go
to
sleep
elma
go
to
sleep
kitty
went
out
of
the
room
and
stood
and
reflected
for
a
few
moments
on
the
landing
here
a
state
of
things
kitty
said
to
herself
but
on
the
whole
i
rather
like
it
i
knew
i
should
be
good
in
emergencies
i
felt
that
it
was
in
me
i
am
afraid
poor
elma
is
going
to
be
downright
ill
i
suppose
i
did
wrong
to
run
away
perhaps
i
did
but
i
am
so
relieved
about
laurie
that
nothing
else
seems
to
matter
now
i
will
telegraph
immediately
to
the
dear
old
dad
and
ask
him
to
come
right
away
here
at
once
when
i
see
him
and
know
that
laurie
is
really
saved
i
just
tell
him
everything
oh
yes
that
is
the
only
only
thing
to
do
kitty
went
straight
to
the
nearest
post
office
and
in
an
incredibly
short
space
of
time
the
following
message
was
being
carried
across
the
wires
to
castle
malone
at
the
sign
of
the
red
doe
you
will
be
surprised
father
but
i
have
run
away
from
school
i
will
tell
you
everything
when
i
see
you
i
am
here
with
a
sick
girl
who
has
also
run
away
we
have
very
little
money
and
i
your
kitty
want
you
dreadfully
come
to
me
as
quickly
as
you
can
kitty
malone
bless
him
said
the
girl
to
herself
he
may
be
angry
for
a
minute
but
this
message
will
bring
him
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
now
that
it
has
gone
off
i
wonder
ought
i
to
let
them
know
at
middleton
kitty
reflected
earnestly
over
this
problem
she
quickly
however
made
up
her
mind
to
keep
her
secret
to
herself
a
little
suspense
will
be
rather
good
for
alice
than
otherwise
she
thought
and
although
mr
and
denvers
may
be
anxious
about
me
they
can
but
telegraph
to
father
and
as
he
will
know
my
address
already
it
wo
put
him
into
a
taking
miss
sherrard
too
can
bear
it
and
as
to
carrie
i
am
really
sorry
for
poor
old
carrie
and
i
should
not
much
mind
having
her
here
but
i
think
until
father
comes
i
will
look
after
elma
my
lone
self
as
they
say
in
ireland
having
made
up
her
mind
kitty
went
back
to
the
hotel
and
asked
the
landlady
with
whom
she
was
now
great
friends
to
send
for
the
best
doctor
in
the
neighborhood
marchand
arrived
in
the
course
of
the
morning
and
pronounced
elma
to
be
ill
but
not
alarmingly
so
your
young
friend
is
suffering
from
considerable
shock
he
said
and
has
evidently
also
taken
a
severe
cold
but
with
care
and
nursing
she
will
in
all
probability
soon
get
relief
that
is
if
the
strain
from
which
she
is
suffering
is
taken
off
her
mind
oh
i
think
i
can
manage
that
answered
kitty
nodding
to
the
doctor
in
a
very
bright
and
frank
way
her
eyes
were
shining
like
stars
the
color
in
her
cheeks
the
set
of
her
beautiful
head
on
her
lovely
neck
the
very
arrangement
of
her
clothes
fairly
bewitched
that
good
man
he
had
seldom
seen
such
sparkling
eyes
nor
such
a
beautiful
dimpled
mouth
kitty
manner
completely
won
marchand
over
to
her
side
as
it
had
already
done
the
good
people
at
the
hotel
after
getting
innumerable
directions
from
the
doctor
she
went
downstairs
to
consult
with
her
land
lady
now
stacey
she
said
i
must
buy
lots
of
things
and
i
wonder
if
you
can
help
me
i
have
telegraphed
to
father
to
come
here
but
until
he
does
i
have
only
this
much
here
she
opened
her
purse
and
tumbled
the
contents
on
to
the
landlady
palm
stacey
started
back
in
some
astonishment
really
this
was
a
very
fascinating
young
lady
but
she
had
never
met
anybody
quite
so
so
out
of
the
common
you
can
reckon
it
up
if
you
like
said
kitty
you
will
see
that
it
does
not
come
to
two
pounds
now
do
you
know
of
a
shop
that
would
trust
me
give
me
credit
i
mean
for
some
things
what
sort
of
things
miss
oh
clothes
and
a
couple
of
trunks
you
see
we
are
not
respectable
without
trunks
are
we
oh
yes
miss
malone
you
are
but
do
you
know
of
such
a
shop
please
think
very
hard
mrs
stacey
williamson
round
the
corner
will
oblige
you
to
any
extent
miss
if
you
mention
my
name
then
i
go
there
immediately
thank
you
how
very
nice
you
are
said
kitty
of
course
i
ought
not
to
be
nice
to
you
miss
for
it
ai
right
no
that
it
ai
to
encourage
runaways
when
you
know
our
story
you
will
be
quite
glad
you
encouraged
us
laughed
kitty
then
perhaps
you
confide
in
me
miss
kitty
colored
and
thought
for
a
moment
i
think
father
must
know
it
first
she
said
and
now
i
must
rush
away
to
get
the
things
that
poor
elma
requires
during
the
course
of
that
day
it
could
scarcely
be
said
that
kitty
malone
was
without
luggage
for
two
new
trunks
presently
made
their
appearance
full
to
the
brim
with
all
sorts
of
dainty
clothing
both
for
elma
and
herself
elma
she
cried
dancing
into
the
i
have
got
two
of
the
most
charming
hats
you
ever
laid
eyes
on
mine
is
sweetly
becoming
to
me
and
i
am
sure
yours
will
suit
you
equally
well
they
are
both
big
white
leghorns
with
great
bunches
of
black
feathers
in
front
they
look
sweet
with
our
new
muslin
dresses
mine
is
pink
but
i
thought
blue
would
suit
you
best
i
expect
dad
evening
at
the
latest
and
i
am
going
to
meet
him
at
the
station
in
my
new
hat
and
dress
there
will
be
no
doubt
about
his
forgiving
me
when
he
sees
me
in
them
just
then
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
and
kitty
rushing
to
open
it
found
a
telegram
awaiting
her
she
tore
it
open
and
read
the
following
words
starting
from
dublin
by
the
with
you
dennis
malone
there
did
i
say
he
was
a
darling
the
best
best
darling
in
the
world
cried
the
excited
girl
oh
wo
he
have
a
mille
afaltha
wo
he
elma
i
am
almost
beside
myself
i
do
know
what
you
are
talking
about
said
elma
what
do
you
mean
by
those
queer
words
mille
oh
they
are
the
irish
for
a
hundred
thousand
welcomes
we
put
them
over
our
arches
and
everything
when
people
are
coming
home
oh
they
do
speak
a
half
nor
a
quarter
of
what
our
hearts
are
full
of
oh
father
father
the
joy
the
joy
your
poor
little
kitty
feels
at
the
thought
of
seeing
your
darling
face
again
that
night
again
kitty
lay
awake
although
elma
slept
strange
thoughts
strange
and
new
were
coursing
through
the
young
girl
brain
everything
had
been
a
failure
and
yet
she
felt
bright
and
happy
and
like
her
old
self
once
more
it
is
the
thought
of
seeing
father
she
said
to
herself
i
was
never
fit
for
england
england
and
its
ways
will
never
suit
me
never
never
but
when
i
see
father
i
shall
be
all
right
oh
to
think
that
he
is
really
coming
and
that
laurie
is
saved
i
must
of
course
tell
father
everything
but
he
wo
be
angry
with
laurie
when
i
tell
him
the
story
in
my
own
way
accordingly
early
the
next
morning
kitty
dressed
herself
in
the
fascinating
leghorn
hat
and
slipped
on
the
pink
muslin
dress
and
with
a
bunch
of
roses
at
her
belt
sallied
forth
to
the
railway
station
she
soon
found
the
right
platform
and
paced
up
and
down
in
a
fever
of
impatience
waiting
for
the
train
as
she
was
doing
so
flaunting
her
pretty
little
person
in
a
somewhat
aggressive
way
and
causing
some
ladies
to
gaze
at
her
with
anything
but
approval
a
hand
was
laid
on
her
arm
and
turning
she
saw
to
her
amazement
the
extremely
indignant
faces
of
miss
sherrard
and
miss
worrick
well
kitty
after
this
said
miss
sherrard
oh
please
do
scold
me
just
now
said
kitty
with
a
little
gasp
wait
until
he
comes
until
who
comes
father
i
am
expecting
him
by
this
train
i
am
relieved
at
that
said
miss
sherrard
i
shall
have
a
painful
tale
to
tell
him
so
you
may
miss
sherrard
you
may
tell
him
everything
but
please
let
me
tell
him
my
story
first
you
must
you
shall
i
insist
the
girl
eyes
were
flashing
she
was
trembling
all
over
just
when
her
happiness
seemed
to
be
at
its
height
for
miss
sherrard
and
miss
worrick
to
appear
oh
and
there
the
train
she
cried
he
will
be
here
in
a
minute
let
me
see
him
first
oh
the
train
is
stopping
and
there
he
is
i
see
him
at
the
very
end
there
he
is
with
his
white
hair
and
let
me
go
let
me
go
she
rushed
from
miss
sherrard
retaining
arm
and
flew
up
the
platform
and
a
moment
later
the
owner
of
the
pink
dress
and
leghorn
hat
was
being
clasped
tightly
tightly
to
the
breast
of
the
old
gentleman
almost
a
king
in
his
way
who
had
suddenly
stepped
on
to
the
platform
father
you
protect
me
they
have
come
they
have
followed
me
you
will
let
me
tell
you

story

how
my
heart
is
beating
why

kitty
kitty
my
own
what

it
kit
i
say

what
is
wrong

now
that

story

there

we
are
staying
at
the
sign
of
the
red
doe

that

first
and
then
you
will
see
them
introduce
me
to
them
kitty
and
calm
yourself
come
kitty
come
yes
father
yes
it
is
all
right
kitty
terrible
excitement
subsided
leaning
on
her
father
arm
she
approached
the
platform
where
miss
sherrard
and
miss
worrick
both
looking
rather
confused
were
standing
this
is
my
father
miss
sherrard
said
kitty
introducing
dennis
malone
who
took
off
his
hat
with
a
grand
sweep
i
am
relieved
to
see
you
began
miss
sherrard
pardon
me
one
moment
madam
said
malone
but
kitty
here
would
like
to
tell
me
her
story
first
you
are
her
the
lady
with
whom
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
corresponding
i
am
and
i
have
a
very
very
painful
tale
to
tell
you
you
shall
tell
me
your
story
afterward
here
the
owner
of
castle
malone
caught
sight
of
miss
worrick
and
gave
her
a
bow
even
more
deferential
than
he
had
bestowed
upon
the
i
am
sorry
to
put
you
off
even
for
a
few
moments
ladies
he
said
but
you
see
this
little
girl
she
she
must
come
first
however
badly
she
has
behaved
she
she
is
my
only
girl
you
understand
and
i
i
must
hear
her
story
first
will
you
meet
us
both
within
an
hour
at
the
sign
of
the
red
doe
then
everything
can
be
explained
i
wonder
if
that
dreadful
girl
is
to
go
unpunished
in
the
end
said
miss
worrick
to
miss
sherrard
as
they
both
slowly
went
to
the
nearest
hotel
to
wait
until
the
time
arranged
to
meet
kitty
and
her
father
at
the
sign
of
the
red
doe
it
seems
like
it
said
miss
sherrard
but
what
a
splendid
old
man
perhaps
after
all
it
may
be
the
best
thing
for
kitty
malone
not
to
punish
her
miss
worrick
oh
miss
sherrard
i
can
not
approve
of
your
very
lax
opinions
surely
punishment
for
such
terrible
yes
she
behaved
badly
but
not
so
badly
as
elma
i
think
we
must
wait
to
hear
the
whole
story
explained
at
present
we
are
more
or
less
in
the
dark
and
now
kit
what
is
it
said
the
squire
when
he
and
his
daughter
were
ensconced
in
the
little
at
the
sign
of
the
red
doe
do
you
mind
if
i
give
you
one
of
my
real
big
hugs
first
said
kitty
to
be
sure
not
alanna
oh
acushla
macree
it
is
like
flowers
in
may
to
see
you
again
there
i
am
better
now
said
kitty
after
she
had
bestowed
one
of
her
most
violent
hugs
upon
her
father
let
me
sit
on
your
knee
and
i
will
tell
you
everything
at
the
best
it
was
a
sad
story
a
story
full
of
full
of
impulse
full
of
passion
and
although
kitty
tried
hard
to
make
part
of
it
as
light
as
possible
the
squire
eyes
blazed
and
a
thundering
note
came
into
his
voice
as
he
listened
that
a
bad
girl
kitty
he
cried
and
you
ought
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
but
that
exactly
it
father
that
what
i
am
coming
to
if
you
wo
let
me
have
anything
to
do
with
elma
why
why
you
must
punish
me
terribly
i
want
you
to
let
me
to
let
me
make
elma
my
real
friend
that
sort
of
girl
your
friend
not
if
i
know
it
said
the
squire
but
please
father
do
let
me
plead
for
her
i
have
done
her
injury
and
she
she
has
never
had
advantages
like
the
rest
of
us
then
kitty
began
to
coax
and
few
very
few
people
could
coax
like
this
irish
girl
not
only
with
her
voice
but
with
her
eyes
with
a
smile
here
and
a
frown
there
she
set
herself
to
bring
old
squire
malone
to
her
way
of
thinking
and
as
always
from
the
time
she
was
a
tiny
child
she
had
been
able
to
twist
this
old
lion
round
her
little
finger
so
she
twisted
him
now
you
have
got
to
do
it
father
she
said
at
last
you
have
got
to
forgive
laurie
and
you
have
got
to
forgive
elma
and
bless
the
boy
it
was
just
like
his
recklessness
why
did
he
come
and
tell
me
he
was
afraid
of
his
old
father
was
he
well
father
you
know
you
are
very
fierce
when
you
like
tut
tut
kitty
do
you
begin
to
scold
no
i
wo
not
if
you
yield
to
me
full
and
free
forgiveness
for
the
whole
three
of
us
for
your
kit
bless
you
child
i
have
forgiven
you
already
ay
did
i
know
it
did
i
say
he
was
a
dear
old
thing
now
laurie
you
wo
say
a
word
to
him
i
give
him
a
right
good
scolding
why
then
dad
your
scolding
never
did
anybody
any
harm
your
bark
is
worse
than
your
bite
you
know
but
there
will
be
no
school
in
england
for
him
that
what
i
mean
well
it
does
seem
to
have
succeeded
with
you
asthore
no
more
it
did
why
it
was
breaking
the
heart
in
me
entirely
so
you

kitty
flung
open
the
door
and
the
of
middleton
school
and
her
subordinate
found
it
closed
behind
them
they
had
a
short
interview
with
squire
malone
very
short
it
ended
by
miss
sherrard
and
the
squire
shaking
hands
most
heartily
you
did
your
best
for
her
and
i
am
awfully
obliged
to

said
the
squire
but
after
all
she
is
too
wild
for
england
she
had
better
stay
in
her
own
land
i
believe
you
are
right
said
miss
sherrard
