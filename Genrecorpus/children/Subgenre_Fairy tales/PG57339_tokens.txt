the
fox
that
wanted
nine
golden
tails
chapter
i
he
was
a
japanese
fox
and
although
he
looked
just
like
any
other
fox
he
knew
a
few
things
that
his
american
brothers
have
never
heard
about
even
to
this
day
one
of
these
things
was
that
if
he
lived
to
be
one
hundred
years
old
without
ever
being
chased
by
a
dog
he
could
become
a
beautiful
woman
if
he
lived
for
five
hundred
years
and
never
a
dog
pursued
him
he
could
be
changed
into
a
mighty
wizard
who
would
know
more
than
any
man
on
earth
but
better
than
all
after
a
thousand
years
of
peace
he
would
turn
into
a
celestial
fox
and
have
nine
golden
tails
now
a
beautiful
woman
does
very
well
in
her
place
and
it
is
a
great
honor
to
be
a
wise
man
but
a
fox
with
nine
golden
tails
is
the
most
wonderful
thing
in
all
the
world
for
that
reason
when
the
fox
was
very
young
only
about
sixty
or
he
thought
he
would
refuse
to
be
changed
into
either
a
woman
or
a
wizard
and
would
wait
for
his
thousandth
birthday
there
are
enough
pretty
women
and
wise
men
in
the
world
now
he
explained
to
his
friends
of
the
forest
the
pretty
women
make
the
trouble
and
the
wise
men
try
to
straighten
it
out
and
they
are
both
kept
busy
they
don
t
have
half
as
much
fun
as
a
but
as
the
years
went
by
he
grew
so
tired
of
skulking
and
hiding
about
and
being
nothing
but
a
common
gray
fox
that
he
almost
decided
to
compromise
the
matter
after
all
there
are
worse
things
in
the
world
than
pretty
women
he
said
scratching
his
ear
and
wise
men
have
their
what
settled
the
question
quite
suddenly
was
a
most
exciting
adventure
he
had
just
when
he
had
begun
to
think
he
was
cunning
enough
to
outwit
all
the
dogs
on
the
island
of
japan
now
he
had
had
a
great
deal
of
experience
in
this
line
and
it
was
no
wonder
he
flattered
himself
his
dodging
tactics
were
perfect
his
ear
was
so
trained
he
could
hear
a
dog
barking
miles
away
and
he
could
smell
a
pack
of
hounds
even
further
than
he
could
hear
them
besides
when
he
looked
at
their
tracks
he
knew
exactly
how
long
it
had
been
since
they
passed
that
way
and
as
he
had
many
acquaintances
among
the
birds
and
bees
and
butterflies
they
too
often
gave
him
timely
warning
he
had
also
traveled
extensively
and
knew
all
the
safe
places
for
a
fox
to
stop
at
last
after
enduring
many
hardships
and
sleeping
in
swamps
and
on
beds
of
nettles
and
sometimes
having
to
run
all
night
and
not
sleep
at
all
and
being
forced
to
move
so
many
times
that
he
never
had
any
home
feeling
he
had
discovered
the
most
delightful
spot
imaginable
it
was
a
beautiful
wood
toward
the
north
of
the
island
where
the
gnarled
old
trees
were
so
thick
and
crooked
and
the
weeds
so
tall
that
the
sun
never
touched
the
ground
and
it
was
so
dark
and
gloomy
there
men
said
it
was
the
home
of
gnomes
and
goblins
and
no
one
could
be
induced
to
pass
through
it
even
the
little
streams
gurgled
hoarsely
and
their
waters
were
black
and
the
great
owls
couldn
t
tell
when
it
was
night
and
so
hooted
throughout
the
day
and
bats
were
always
flying
about
with
shrill
screams
as
many
wild
creatures
looking
for
peace
found
their
way
here
and
never
again
went
out
of
the
forest
he
had
much
good
company
there
were
foxes
bears
birds
deer
monkeys
rabbits
squirrels
pigeons
ducks
and
a
host
of
tiny
things
like
worms
beetles
scorpions
mice
ants
lizards
centipedes
frogs
grasshoppers
eels
snails
crabs
and
caterpillars
and
also
a
wild
hen
and
her
mate
who
had
a
very
hard
time
ever
raising
a
family
a
pouyou
brought
all
the
way
from
south
america
with
the
initials
of
a
sailor
who
would
never
see
it
again
cut
on
its
brown
shell
armor
crickets
that
the
japanese
call
grass
larks
and
that
sing
more
sweetly
there
than
any
place
in
the
world
a
tortoise
so
many
hundreds
of
years
old
he
didn
t
remember
when
he
was
born
a
rusty
old
crocodile
who
called
himself
and
a
parrot
that
had
known
the
misery
of
living
in
a
cage
until
once
the
door
was
left
open
then
he
went
away
without
saying
and
flew
straight
over
the
hills
and
rivers
and
rice
fields
until
he
lit
on
a
tree
in
this
wood
how
he
chuckled
when
he
knew
he
had
reached
the
land
he
had
so
often
heard
about
the
land
the
birds
call
napatantutu
which
in
their
language
means
stay
here
always
and
at
first
he
thought
it
a
great
joke
to
scream
look
out
and
a
few
other
human
words
not
so
polite
and
throw
all
the
animals
in
a
panic
but
after
he
had
been
there
a
while
he
either
reformed
or
forgot
how
men
talked
and
so
bothered
them
no
more
the
tortoise
having
lived
longer
than
any
of
the
others
had
had
time
to
find
out
more
and
he
said
there
was
a
huge
monster
in
a
part
of
the
wood
that
was
neither
man
nor
beast
but
more
dangerous
than
either
its
eyes
were
bright
as
any
glass
its
scales
were
hard
as
any
brass
he
declared
and
when
it
roared
the
whole
earth
grew
dark
with
the
smoke
from
its
steaming
nostrils
and
when
it
laughed
a
flame
came
out
of
its
mouth
that
lit
up
the
sky
and
this
terrible
thing
was
called
a
dragon
it
goes
without
saying
they
were
all
very
careful
to
keep
away
from
the
particular
place
where
the
dragon
was
said
to
live
and
as
none
of
them
had
ever
seen
it
they
were
not
sure
it
was
there
the
snail
had
been
heard
to
stoutly
declare
he
wouldn
t
run
from
it
anyway
but
as
the
reminded
him
it
was
very
easy
to
be
brave
before
you
saw
it
coming
but
he
had
heard
of
snails
that
got
in
such
a
hurry
they
left
their
houses
behind
them
the
bear
asked
the
very
important
question
how
many
legs
has
a
dragon
and
when
the
tortoise
said
it
must
have
at
least
a
million
since
a
centipede
had
a
hundred
the
bear
was
comforted
for
as
he
wisely
told
the
fox
one
need
not
be
afraid
of
anything
if
it
has
more
than
four
legs
now
there
wasn
t
much
difference
between
day
and
night
in
napatantutu
for
both
were
happy
times
and
they
could
eat
when
they
wished
and
sleep
when
they
wished
and
they
didn
t
have
to
do
anything
unless
they
liked
to
do
it
sometimes
they
would
eat
and
sleep
all
day
and
at
night
when
the
green
eyes
of
the
owls
shone
like
lanterns
and
the
fireflies
lit
up
the
wood
with
their
little
lamps
they
would
meet
in
a
wonderful
dell
all
lined
with
moss
softer
than
velvet
carpet
and
there
they
would
romp
and
play
until
morning
the
frogs
would
sit
in
a
solemn
circle
on
toadstools
the
worms
because
they
wanted
to
see
what
was
going
on
would
crawl
up
on
the
grand
stand
which
was
the
pouyou
s
back
the
ants
would
hold
wee
pink
and
blue
flowers
over
them
for
parasols
because
they
tried
to
be
fashionable
the
monkey
was
always
the
clown
the
quiet
tortoise
the
judge
and
the
fox
was
the
mischief
maker
but
too
sly
to
ever
be
caught
in
his
tricks
the
frog
liked
to
show
how
far
he
could
jump
the
deer
always
wanted
to
run
a
race
the
monkey
would
put
up
a
target
for
them
to
throw
at
the
bear
would
dance
on
his
hind
legs
while
the
crickets
and
the
grasshoppers
were
the
band
and
when
the
circus
was
over
the
porcupine
would
invite
them
to
a
party
or
if
they
grew
tired
of
fun
and
frolic
the
pouyou
would
tell
them
stories
about
a
land
far
beyond
the
sun
s
nest
where
the
birds
and
butterflies
the
parrots
and
lizards
were
redder
than
red
and
greener
than
green
and
again
of
a
wide
world
of
water
with
houses
that
rocked
all
the
time
floating
on
it
but
where
these
houses
came
from
or
where
they
went
he
had
been
too
sick
to
find
out
although
he
had
been
in
one
for
many
sad
months
and
when
the
thunder
rumbled
and
flashes
of
lightning
shot
through
the
leaves
and
the
owls
shut
their
eyes
in
terror
and
the
poor
little
fireflies
put
out
their
lights
they
would
whisper
to
each
other
that
the
dragon
was
around
and
scamper
away
and
hide
until
morning
and
then
when
it
was
daylight
they
wouldn
t
be
a
bit
frightened
and
each
one
would
say
the
other
ran
first
and
he
only
ran
because
some
one
behind
pushed
him
and
he
couldn
t
help
it
and
they
would
pooh
pooh
and
declare
in
a
chorus
they
didn
t
believe
there
was
any
such
thing
as
a
dragon
but
the
fox
who
was
usually
a
big
talker
never
had
anything
to
say
except
once
when
he
told
them
quite
seriously
he
hoped
there
was
a
real
true
live
dragon
but
no
one
believed
him
they
did
not
know
that
when
he
was
a
baby
fox
only
about
the
size
of
a
cat
and
lived
in
the
fertile
plain
of
sweet
flags
one
cool
and
dewy
night
his
mother
made
a
bed
of
leaves
behind
a
log
and
as
she
cuddled
him
close
to
her
warm
bosom
she
told
him
how
to
know
if
the
dogs
were
anywhere
around
she
said
when
the
wind
brought
him
a
hot
breath
out
of
a
cold
nose
a
breath
that
smelt
like
it
had
a
bark
in
it
he
must
listen
with
both
ears
and
after
that
if
he
heard
a
sound
that
was
neither
hungry
nor
angry
but
came
full
tilt
out
of
a
throat
just
bursting
with
joy
he
would
know
that
the
dogs
were
on
his
trail
for
they
only
chased
animals
for
the
fun
of
catching
them
and
because
a
fox
was
so
cunning
it
was
great
sport
to
run
him
down
and
if
he
saw
strange
tracks
in
which
had
lodged
a
caterpillar
s
hair
or
an
ant
s
egg
the
dogs
had
passed
the
day
before
but
if
the
tracks
were
bare
the
feet
that
made
them
were
not
far
away
and
she
added
if
he
were
smart
enough
to
never
never
let
the
dogs
get
after
him
when
he
was
a
thousand
years
old
a
dragon
would
give
him
nine
golden
tails
it
was
true
no
one
had
ever
seen
a
fox
with
more
than
one
tail
but
in
the
kojiri
or
tails
of
ancient
things
which
was
written
on
the
bark
of
the
oldest
trees
it
had
always
been
told
that
there
would
be
one
fox
who
would
in
this
way
become
the
hero
of
his
race
and
perhaps
he
would
be
that
very
one
if
he
learned
to
be
clever
and
careful
and
as
his
mother
was
the
wisest
fox
on
earth
he
knew
that
she
knew
what
she
was
talking
about
and
he
was
glad
now
to
hear
there
was
a
dragon
handy
in
fact
napatantutu
was
exactly
the
kind
of
a
home
the
fox
was
looking
for
dragon
and
all
and
he
was
quite
sure
he
could
pass
a
thousand
quiet
years
here
without
ever
hearing
the
bark
of
a
dog
he
no
longer
jumped
at
the
sound
of
every
crackling
twig
or
put
his
ear
to
the
ground
before
he
sat
down
to
rest
and
often
he
would
lie
for
hours
on
some
cool
knoll
licking
his
paws
and
thinking
up
some
prank
to
play
on
his
neighbors
and
he
grew
fat
and
saucy
and
lazy
and
whisked
his
one
insignificant
tail
proudly
as
he
walked
but
alas
there
came
an
end
to
these
delightful
days
late
in
the
afternoon
of
his
hundredth
birthday
as
he
stood
watching
two
ants
wage
a
fierce
battle
over
a
grain
of
rice
close
behind
him
he
heard
a
sound
that
made
his
very
blood
run
cold
he
raised
his
head
and
sniffed
the
air
then
stood
trembling
the
dogs
he
groaned
as
a
second
time
and
nearer
now
came
the
awful
noise
and
he
darted
like
an
arrow
through
the
forest
chapter
ii
now
nio
kuro
a
prince
and
the
most
famous
hunter
in
the
kingdom
had
come
in
his
boat
down
the
river
that
ran
through
the
haunted
wood
with
him
he
had
brought
many
servants
and
his
pack
of
trained
leopards
with
which
he
hunted
and
which
were
swifter
and
had
keener
scent
than
any
dogs
possibly
nio
kuro
had
never
heard
of
this
forest
or
it
may
have
been
that
he
became
so
excited
when
the
leopards
started
on
their
wild
chase
that
he
forgot
to
be
afraid
of
goblins
at
any
rate
he
dashed
headlong
into
the
wood
encouraging
his
leopards
with
loud
shouts
and
his
servants
after
a
moment
s
hesitation
followed
him
the
fox
was
crashing
through
the
underbrush
just
ahead
of
his
pursuers
now
tearing
his
way
through
hanging
vines
and
again
leaping
over
rocks
and
streams
the
leopards
came
closer
and
closer
behind
him
on
they
flew
through
swamps
and
thickets
into
thorn
bushes
and
bramble
patches
and
across
deep
ravines
and
not
even
the
wind
could
keep
up
with
them
at
last
the
poor
fox
was
tired
out
his
legs
were
torn
and
bleeding
he
had
left
bunches
of
his
fur
on
many
a
bush
and
thorn
his
feet
were
bruised
and
lame
and
his
breath
almost
gone
too
late
he
found
that
he
had
slept
too
much
and
eaten
too
much
during
the
long
comfortable
days
he
had
spent
in
his
new
home
and
that
he
could
not
run
as
once
he
did
when
he
was
thin
and
lithe
and
his
legs
were
hard
and
his
feet
like
rubber
panting
gasping
his
tongue
hanging
out
foam
dripping
from
his
mouth
he
went
blindly
on
in
irregular
leaps
the
leopards
were
gaining
on
him
every
moment
already
he
could
feel
the
hot
breath
of
the
spotted
leader
burn
his
flanks
and
he
knew
his
time
had
come
never
no
never
would
he
be
a
fox
with
nine
golden
tails
he
would
merely
die
a
cruel
death
and
his
one
poor
bushy
tail
would
be
carried
away
as
a
trophy
his
body
torn
to
pieces
by
savage
beasts
as
this
sad
picture
rose
up
before
him
he
made
one
last
long
leap
for
liberty
and
then
his
trembling
legs
could
carry
him
no
further
driven
to
bay
he
snarled
angrily
and
backing
up
against
the
trunk
of
a
great
hollow
tree
turned
to
fight
his
last
battle
then
a
strange
thing
happened
at
that
very
moment
a
huge
and
horrible
creature
he
knew
at
once
must
be
the
dragon
rose
between
him
and
the
maddened
leopards
its
body
was
covered
with
shining
silver
scales
that
crackled
like
burning
logs
as
it
moved
its
ears
were
big
black
wings
that
flapped
like
sails
its
great
claws
had
nails
as
long
and
sharp
as
knives
its
double
tongue
was
two
flames
its
glaring
eyes
seemed
balls
of
fire
and
its
long
tail
curled
and
writhed
like
a
mighty
snake
there
has
been
a
mistake
the
dragon
breathed
and
its
words
came
out
in
smoke
you
were
one
hundred
years
old
this
morning
and
as
you
have
never
in
all
your
life
had
to
run
from
a
dog
you
should
have
been
given
the
chance
to
become
a
beautiful
woman
if
you
give
me
the
chance
now
panted
the
fox
there
is
nothing
i
want
so
much
as
to
be
a
woman
even
an
ugly
one
will
when
the
prince
who
could
not
keep
up
with
the
chase
appeared
on
the
scene
he
found
the
leopards
with
their
tails
tucked
between
their
legs
and
their
heads
hanging
down
there
was
no
fox
anywhere
but
the
most
beautiful
girl
he
had
ever
seen
stood
before
him
for
a
time
nio
kuro
could
only
look
at
her
for
he
was
dumb
with
astonishment
she
blushed
and
drew
her
long
black
hair
over
her
face
until
he
could
barely
see
the
tip
of
her
nose
and
her
little
red
mouth
then
she
knelt
before
him
his
attendants
now
came
running
up
for
he
had
outstripped
them
all
and
they
too
stopped
speechless
with
their
mouths
open
the
prince
did
not
heed
them
he
bent
down
over
the
mysterious
maiden
and
so
far
forgot
his
manners
that
he
took
both
her
small
hands
in
his
and
raised
her
to
her
feet
for
he
wanted
to
see
her
face
again
and
the
more
he
looked
at
her
the
lovelier
she
seemed
to
him
who
are
you
o
fairest
one
he
asked
rapturously
who
is
your
illustrious
father
and
what
is
your
honored
name
but
she
gazed
about
her
in
a
puzzled
way
and
shook
her
head
i
do
not
know
she
answered
the
prince
frowned
at
her
strange
reply
for
he
could
scarcely
believe
his
ears
and
he
even
pinched
himself
under
his
silken
tunic
to
be
sure
he
was
not
dreaming
but
she
was
so
pretty
he
could
not
be
angry
with
her
and
as
he
looked
into
her
soft
brown
eyes
his
frown
changed
into
a
smile
and
he
said
in
a
very
gentle
voice
are
you
lost
are
there
other
hunters
here
who
have
brought
you
with
them
and
now
you
wait
for
them
to
return
i
am
all
alone
she
told
him
he
was
so
surprised
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
at
last
he
stammered
perhaps
you
are
only
teasing
me
or
it
may
be
that
you
are
afraid
of
me
because
i
am
a
stranger
but
no
harm
shall
come
to
you
through
me
that
i
promise
you
i
am
nio
kuro
a
prince
of
the
land
where
the
day
begins
forgive
my
rudeness
in
speaking
to
you
but
will
you
not
let
me
guard
you
and
take
you
back
to
your
friends
i
have
no
friends
and
nowhere
to
go
she
sighed
but
whence
do
you
come
o
sweetest
creature
in
all
the
kingdom
cried
the
bewildered
prince
again
she
shook
her
head
i
belong
to
the
forest
she
said
simply
henceforth
you
shall
belong
to
me
the
prince
declared
and
so
he
took
her
back
to
his
bamboo
castle
as
his
bride
there
every
one
wondered
at
this
fair
maid
of
the
forest
but
no
one
could
find
out
who
were
her
parents
or
where
her
home
had
been
or
anything
about
her
and
the
prince
was
so
charmed
with
her
grace
and
beauty
he
never
bothered
his
head
about
these
questions
that
so
worried
other
people
she
loved
him
and
he
loved
her
and
that
was
all
he
cared
to
know
about
her
for
the
prince
was
a
very
clever
man
he
bought
her
the
loveliest
gowns
of
purple
and
yellow
satin
all
embroidered
in
roses
and
green
leaves
and
jeweled
butterflies
and
she
had
servants
to
wait
upon
her
and
fan
her
and
a
red
and
gold
jinricksha
to
ride
in
he
called
her
a
queer
japanese
word
which
means
wild
flower
for
he
said
she
grew
and
blossomed
in
the
forest
and
he
transplanted
her
and
made
her
a
princess
but
that
was
just
his
own
pet
name
for
her
and
he
ordered
that
throughout
the
land
where
the
day
begins
she
should
be
known
as
the
princess
hoshi
or
the
star
princess
and
he
gave
a
great
supper
and
invited
all
the
people
of
his
kingdom
to
it
and
in
the
center
of
the
table
was
a
cake
so
big
it
looked
like
a
mountain
and
around
it
were
blooming
all
the
joyous
and
lucky
flowers
while
out
in
the
court
was
a
maple
tree
covered
with
what
every
one
thought
at
first
was
autumn
leaves
but
these
leaves
turned
out
to
be
little
cakes
of
every
color
under
the
sun
and
each
guest
was
given
a
red
paper
bag
filled
with
them
to
carry
home
no
wonder
they
were
all
glad
the
prince
had
found
a
princess
hoshi
and
wished
him
and
his
star
princess
long
life
and
much
joy
it
is
true
there
were
some
who
as
soon
as
they
got
away
nodded
their
heads
knowingly
as
they
munched
their
cakes
and
said
the
princess
was
an
odd
person
and
perhaps
the
prince
would
one
day
wish
he
had
left
her
in
the
forest
now
a
bamboo
castle
is
a
charming
place
to
live
there
were
wind
bells
hung
all
along
the
eaves
and
they
tinkled
with
the
whisper
of
every
passing
breeze
and
the
windows
were
of
paper
so
that
when
the
princess
wanted
to
look
out
of
doors
all
she
had
to
do
was
to
poke
a
hole
in
one
of
them
with
her
finger
and
by
putting
one
eye
there
she
could
see
everything
that
was
passing
and
no
one
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
and
there
were
hundreds
of
mats
on
the
floor
of
every
room
and
these
were
soft
and
cool
to
walk
upon
even
in
doyo
or
the
period
of
greatest
heat
and
the
prince
went
all
the
way
to
the
town
of
hirosaki
to
get
her
a
bronze
mirror
that
she
might
see
how
pretty
she
was
and
she
often
looked
in
it
he
also
brought
her
a
fluffy
little
dog
but
she
screamed
and
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
so
in
its
place
he
gave
her
a
red
cat
without
any
tail
that
purred
pleasantly
whenever
she
touched
it
at
night
she
slept
on
a
pillow
of
shining
black
wood
and
on
it
were
sprawling
straggling
letters
of
gold
that
spelled
the
name
of
the
baku
for
the
baku
in
japan
has
the
body
of
a
horse
the
face
of
a
lion
the
trunk
and
tusks
of
an
elephant
the
tail
of
a
cow
and
the
feet
of
a
tiger
and
it
eats
up
evil
dreams
in
fact
it
never
eats
anything
else
and
yet
it
is
always
fat
so
not
only
did
the
princess
have
everything
comfortable
and
agreeable
while
she
was
awake
but
even
in
her
sleep
only
sweet
dreams
could
come
to
her
and
on
summer
evenings
when
there
wasn
t
any
moon
the
prince
would
have
many
paper
lanterns
lit
and
hung
in
the
garden
and
lamps
that
looked
like
flowers
would
be
swung
in
the
trees
and
then
he
would
have
his
servants
who
had
been
busy
all
day
catching
them
in
nets
turn
out
thousands
of
fireflies
with
their
little
golden
lights
all
glowing
and
the
garden
would
be
changed
into
fairyland
the
princess
would
sit
in
an
arbor
fringed
with
wistaria
blossoms
and
sip
her
tea
while
some
of
her
maidens
would
sing
for
her
and
others
with
much
bowing
and
waving
of
fans
would
dance
in
a
slow
and
solemn
fashion
and
again
when
the
moon
was
a
big
soft
bright
ball
and
the
clouds
were
very
blue
she
and
the
prince
and
her
maidens
would
go
to
the
pavilion
in
the
center
of
the
garden
and
climb
the
many
steps
to
the
top
where
there
was
a
room
called
the
place
of
peace
and
the
prince
would
tell
his
in
the
lovely
language
of
the
land
that
the
sun
was
a
golden
crow
and
the
moon
a
jeweled
hare
and
of
how
princess
splendor
the
dear
daughter
of
the
moon
once
ran
away
and
when
her
mother
called
her
she
climbed
home
on
a
moonbeam
crying
silver
tears
and
all
her
tears
took
wings
and
flew
down
to
earth
and
turned
into
fireflies
but
the
princess
would
have
thoughts
they
could
not
understand
and
ask
questions
that
would
make
even
nio
kuro
smile
once
she
said
to
him
quite
seriously
did
you
ever
see
a
dragon
certainly
he
answered
there
were
many
of
these
wriggling
creatures
made
of
red
and
yellow
and
pink
and
green
paper
with
lanterns
for
eyes
carried
in
the
festival
procession
last
year
they
were
very
paper
dragons
she
cried
scornfully
i
mean
live
i
have
read
of
them
and
seen
many
pictures
of
them
he
told
her
there
was
one
called
riu
gu
the
dragon
king
of
the
world
under
the
sea
and
when
he
sneezed
the
waters
would
jump
up
and
tumble
over
each
other
in
mighty
waves
and
every
time
the
dragon
caught
cold
many
a
fishing
boat
went
down
but
that
was
years
and
years
ago
and
now
all
the
dragons
are
and
she
only
laughed
and
said
no
more
but
she
knew
better
perhaps
the
trouble
was
she
knew
too
much
to
be
a
princess
and
that
was
why
she
at
last
got
dreadfully
bored
but
for
many
months
everything
went
on
beautifully
at
bamboo
castle
and
the
prince
and
wild
flower
were
deliciously
happy
it
was
very
nice
to
have
a
magnificent
home
and
a
lake
full
of
gold
fish
and
a
shady
garden
where
fountains
trickled
drops
of
music
and
little
crystal
streams
rushed
over
the
rocks
and
sang
to
the
lilies
on
their
banks
and
it
was
pleasant
to
wear
lovely
clothes
and
eat
sharks
fins
and
birds
nest
soup
and
bamboo
shoots
and
lotus
bulbs
and
other
delicacies
that
only
very
rich
people
can
have
in
japan
and
she
was
glad
to
think
she
wasn
t
a
fox
hiding
out
in
brier
patches
always
listening
for
dogs
and
sometimes
hungry
surely
it
was
much
better
to
be
a
princess
than
a
fox
then
gradually
a
change
came
over
her
and
although
she
had
everything
she
wanted
she
was
no
longer
happy
sometimes
in
the
day
when
she
lingered
by
the
lake
and
watched
the
little
gold
fish
dart
about
like
flames
in
the
clear
water
and
jump
up
on
the
bank
to
get
the
lard
cakes
and
rice
balls
she
had
brought
them
she
sighed
and
for
no
reason
at
all
scolded
the
mincing
lady
who
carried
a
gorgeous
parasol
over
her
and
again
in
the
starlit
night
when
she
walked
in
the
perfumed
garden
and
listened
to
the
musical
drip
drip
of
the
fountain
and
heard
the
frogs
calling
to
each
other
from
the
lotus
pools
there
came
to
her
the
memory
of
an
enchanted
land
where
bats
circled
and
shrieked
and
great
owls
squatted
solemnly
on
the
knotty
branches
of
the
trees
winking
and
blinking
and
never
sleeping
and
a
mighty
dragon
with
glaring
eyes
and
shining
scales
lived
in
a
hollow
tree
and
strange
to
say
when
she
remembered
this
dark
and
lonely
forest
her
own
garden
seemed
to
her
but
a
stupid
place
after
a
while
she
grew
tired
of
living
in
a
house
even
if
it
was
a
bamboo
castle
and
whenever
she
went
out
having
men
carry
her
about
in
a
stuffy
chair
and
she
longed
for
the
shade
of
the
wood
the
sound
of
the
hoarsely
gurgling
streams
for
a
run
in
the
early
morning
through
the
grass
for
the
hum
of
the
bees
the
smell
of
the
dead
leaves
and
a
nap
on
a
mossy
bank
so
she
fretted
and
grew
so
discontented
that
ugly
lines
crept
in
between
her
brows
the
rose
all
went
out
of
her
cheeks
and
she
was
so
cross
the
prince
was
once
heard
to
say
he
had
married
a
nettle
in
place
of
a
wild
flower
she
slapped
her
servants
quarreled
with
her
which
in
japan
is
an
awful
thing
to
do
and
was
altogether
as
disagreeable
as
a
woman
could
be
the
prince
was
patient
he
stood
it
for
a
long
time
without
saying
a
word
and
tried
in
every
way
to
please
his
royal
lady
one
day
he
asked
is
there
nothing
fair
one
would
make
you
kind
and
sweet
again
if
anything
will
make
you
happy
only
say
what
it
is
and
i
will
go
even
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
for
after
thinking
a
moment
the
princess
answered
take
me
back
to
the
forest
where
you
found
me
if
i
could
only
see
that
dear
place
again
i
would
be
content
ever
after
but
leave
the
cruel
leopards
behind
she
added
quickly
there
is
much
game
there
he
said
regretfully
but
she
frowned
and
stamped
her
little
foot
angrily
you
shall
not
kill
anything
she
declared
if
you
do
you
will
break
my
perhaps
it
were
best
not
to
hunt
there
he
acknowledged
thinking
of
the
evil
spirits
that
were
said
to
roam
this
forest
it
is
the
land
of
roots
and
the
home
of
darkness
why
do
you
want
to
go
there
now
that
you
are
out
of
it
i
should
think
you
would
want
to
stay
but
she
began
to
cry
and
got
in
such
a
temper
that
he
was
willing
she
should
have
her
way
so
he
had
his
boat
brought
out
and
made
ready
the
next
morning
he
and
the
princess
with
only
the
rowers
to
keep
them
company
started
on
their
long
journey
the
princess
was
silent
and
whenever
he
spoke
to
her
she
answered
him
so
angrily
that
he
ceased
to
try
to
talk
to
her
so
they
sat
on
the
deck
never
saying
a
word
until
the
fifth
morning
when
they
stopped
at
the
very
spot
he
had
moored
his
boat
the
day
he
had
found
her
and
brought
her
away
with
him
chapter
iii
when
the
princess
looked
into
the
mysterious
land
where
not
a
sound
was
heard
she
gathered
up
her
rich
silken
skirt
in
both
hands
and
jumping
ashore
ran
as
fast
as
her
feet
would
carry
her
over
the
same
ground
where
once
the
leopards
had
chased
her
when
she
was
a
fox
she
lost
one
of
her
sandals
her
hair
that
was
fastened
high
on
her
head
with
fans
and
golden
pins
slipped
down
on
her
shoulders
and
the
jeweled
clasp
at
her
waist
dropped
off
but
she
never
stopped
or
looked
behind
the
prince
followed
as
fast
as
he
could
but
so
fleet
of
foot
was
she
that
she
left
him
far
behind
and
when
she
reached
the
big
tree
with
the
hollow
trunk
she
fell
down
before
it
crying
oh
most
powerful
dragon
make
me
a
fox
again
for
now
i
know
it
is
better
to
be
a
fox
than
a
then
out
of
the
hollow
tree
came
the
same
hideous
creature
she
had
seen
before
and
when
it
opened
its
yawning
mouth
its
teeth
shone
like
ivory
spears
and
she
thought
it
was
about
to
swallow
her
but
the
dragon
only
looked
at
her
and
sniffed
scornfully
until
the
smoke
from
its
nostrils
darkened
the
air
and
when
the
prince
came
in
search
of
wild
flower
only
a
gray
fox
darted
through
the
tangled
weeds
and
bushes
and
was
lost
in
the
deep
dark
wood
the
prince
looked
after
it
longingly
oi
oi
he
cried
which
is
the
japanese
way
of
saying
hello
would
that
i
had
my
leopards
with
me
then
would
i
give
chase
and
catch
you
my
fine
but
he
had
no
time
to
bother
with
a
fox
when
his
loved
one
was
lost
in
this
queer
and
dangerous
place
and
he
rushed
frantically
about
the
forest
calling
wild
flower
wild
flower
dear
wild
flower
but
though
he
sought
her
for
many
days
and
all
the
rowers
joined
in
the
hunt
he
never
saw
her
again
so
he
went
back
to
the
bamboo
castle
very
sad
and
lonely
but
every
one
there
tired
of
her
airs
and
her
temper
said
she
was
a
witch
and
he
was
well
rid
of
her
when
he
thought
over
how
peevish
she
had
become
he
was
inclined
to
agree
with
them
and
finally
he
married
a
pretty
and
amiable
little
princess
and
wild
flower
was
forgotten
and
out
in
the
shadowy
depths
of
a
certain
wood
a
cunning
gray
fox
smiled
until
he
showed
his
shining
teeth
when
a
saucy
bird
mocking
the
prince
s
call
repeated
wild
flower
wild
flower
dear
wild
flower
in
its
merry
song
then
he
lay
down
and
rolled
over
in
the
wet
leaves
and
licked
his
fur
contentedly
i
m
glad
i
m
out
of
that
he
said
now
i
ll
wait
until
the
thousand
years
are
up
nothing
will
satisfy
me
except
to
be
a
fox
with
nine
golden
with
never
a
regret
he
went
back
to
the
old
life
and
hunted
mice
and
creeping
things
when
he
got
hungry
and
when
there
was
neither
moon
nor
stars
ran
through
the
black
night
to
the
farm
house
far
beyond
the
edge
of
the
forest
and
came
back
in
the
gray
of
the
morning
with
his
lips
all
bloody
and
his
paws
as
well
the
signs
of
his
midnight
feast
in
the
chicken
yard
the
wonderful
wood
so
dark
so
still
so
cool
put
on
patches
of
color
with
the
passing
month
and
in
the
few
spots
where
the
sunshine
sometimes
crept
the
trees
grew
vivid
with
the
burning
glory
of
autumn
or
pale
and
cold
with
the
first
blue
blossoms
of
spring
then
softly
pink
with
azalea
blooms
or
bright
as
a
glowing
sunset
with
the
flowers
of
peach
and
cherry
and
in
the
period
of
greatest
light
the
leaves
would
cover
the
ground
and
make
soft
beds
where
all
the
wild
things
could
sleep
snug
and
warm
during
the
period
of
greatest
cold
as
for
the
fox
though
he
was
a
bit
quarrelsome
the
years
passed
pleasantly
and
peacefully
no
one
ever
again
came
there
to
hunt
and
such
queer
things
had
been
whispered
abroad
about
what
happened
in
this
pathless
country
where
lived
such
strange
creatures
as
never
man
had
seen
that
travelers
went
far
out
of
their
way
rather
than
pass
through
it
and
on
stormy
nights
when
the
wind
howled
and
windows
rattled
and
the
trees
swayed
and
groaned
people
all
over
the
island
barred
their
doors
tight
and
fast
for
they
said
the
spirits
of
the
wood
are
out
and
they
lit
incense
sticks
to
keep
them
from
coming
in
and
as
they
sipped
their
tea
told
stories
about
the
weird
wood
a
favorite
one
was
that
a
beautiful
princess
was
kept
there
a
prisoner
by
a
cruel
dragon
and
of
how
a
mighty
prince
once
found
her
and
carried
her
away
to
his
castle
but
she
heard
the
dragon
calling
calling
calling
her
all
the
day
and
all
the
night
and
at
last
either
she
slipped
out
of
the
castle
and
went
to
him
or
else
he
came
and
stole
her
away
no
one
knew
just
which
way
it
was
and
while
other
brave
men
would
willingly
go
to
rescue
her
yet
they
all
agreed
what
was
the
use
for
the
dragon
would
get
her
again
and
they
would
have
their
trouble
for
nothing
so
she
had
been
there
now
for
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
years
but
was
still
young
and
lovely
so
the
story
ran
but
like
all
legends
it
got
a
little
twisted
in
the
telling
so
many
summers
and
winters
came
and
went
that
every
one
except
the
fox
forgot
to
count
them
at
last
a
famine
spread
over
all
the
land
it
was
the
period
of
greatest
heat
no
rain
had
fallen
for
many
a
week
the
earth
was
dry
as
a
dead
leaf
the
grass
turned
brown
the
streams
dried
up
the
birds
all
died
or
went
away
one
by
one
the
animals
perished
and
the
once
beautiful
napatantutu
was
grim
and
desolate
the
fox
was
now
five
hundred
years
old
his
coat
of
fur
was
whiter
than
when
he
was
young
his
legs
were
not
so
nimble
and
some
of
his
teeth
were
gone
he
searched
the
wood
for
food
and
water
and
could
find
neither
he
grew
so
thin
that
his
ribs
stuck
through
the
skin
so
weak
he
trembled
like
the
aspen
when
he
walked
the
pains
of
hunger
gnawed
him
day
and
night
and
he
felt
as
if
he
must
surely
die
then
he
mustered
up
all
the
strength
he
had
left
and
crawled
to
the
big
tree
with
the
hollow
trunk
there
he
fell
down
a
heap
of
skin
and
bones
and
called
feebly
for
the
dragon
when
this
terrible
creature
came
out
it
blew
fire
and
smoke
at
him
in
awful
wrath
i
thought
you
wanted
to
be
a
fox
with
nine
golden
tails
why
have
you
disturbed
me
it
thundered
a
fox
with
nine
golden
tails
is
a
nice
thing
to
talk
about
the
poor
fox
whimpered
but
a
wise
man
is
better
than
a
dead
fox
even
if
it
had
twenty
golden
tails
so
make
me
a
wizard
great
one
and
then
will
i
trouble
you
no
bah
cried
the
dragon
with
such
fury
that
the
flames
from
its
mouth
flew
up
to
the
top
of
the
hollow
tree
when
they
died
away
the
fox
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
in
his
place
stood
a
very
old
man
with
green
spectacles
and
a
bald
head
dear
me
this
is
most
peculiar
he
mumbled
as
he
pulled
his
long
gray
whiskers
thoughtfully
i
will
go
to
the
nearest
village
and
get
something
to
eat
then
i
ll
come
back
and
talk
to
that
dragon
a
while
if
i
can
find
out
some
of
his
secrets
i
will
make
myself
the
wisest
man
that
ever
lived
and
then
will
i
become
the
from
one
end
of
the
land
to
the
other
and
even
to
the
islands
far
off
the
coast
spread
the
fame
of
the
great
magician
who
lived
in
a
cave
on
the
sea
shore
princes
talked
about
him
in
their
castles
and
the
very
poorest
people
in
their
little
huts
as
they
counted
their
grains
of
rice
told
of
the
wonderful
wisdom
of
the
cave
man
as
he
was
called
he
can
do
many
strange
things
but
there
is
no
use
going
to
him
if
you
have
not
money
they
said
sadly
he
is
hungry
for
meanwhile
the
cave
man
waxed
rich
the
floor
of
his
cavern
home
was
strewn
with
shining
gold
ornaments
of
silver
and
ivory
were
on
the
walls
and
he
had
great
bags
of
glittering
jewels
and
treasures
of
untold
value
all
given
him
by
those
who
had
come
to
him
for
help
he
could
tell
when
it
would
rain
and
when
a
man
must
plant
his
crop
to
reap
a
full
harvest
where
money
was
hidden
if
it
had
been
stolen
and
who
had
taken
it
who
was
the
right
girl
for
a
man
to
marry
and
who
was
his
secret
enemy
he
knew
what
would
cure
the
sick
what
would
drive
away
evil
spirits
and
everything
that
any
one
could
ask
him
but
he
was
also
very
cruel
when
the
poor
sought
him
in
their
sorrow
he
took
away
their
last
cent
and
he
gave
neither
to
the
sick
nor
to
the
hungry
a
wise
man
is
greater
than
princes
or
kings
he
boasted
some
day
i
will
rule
the
land
and
all
men
shall
pay
tribute
to
and
he
grew
richer
and
richer
every
day
but
still
he
was
not
happy
no
matter
how
many
costly
and
beautiful
gifts
were
brought
him
he
was
never
satisfied
he
became
so
mean
and
miserly
that
at
last
the
good
king
said
we
must
rid
ourselves
of
this
man
too
long
have
i
borne
patiently
with
him
and
allowed
him
to
oppress
my
people
he
is
very
dangerous
if
left
alone
he
may
do
great
harm
and
become
the
curse
of
the
kingdom
he
has
wisdom
and
wealth
and
they
have
not
contented
him
what
will
he
want
next
our
heads
so
one
night
while
the
cave
man
slept
the
officers
of
the
king
crept
in
and
after
beating
him
with
their
spears
bound
him
hand
and
foot
and
carried
him
off
to
prison
all
the
gold
and
precious
stones
and
splendid
gifts
the
people
had
brought
him
were
sold
and
the
money
given
to
the
poor
and
there
was
feasting
and
rejoicing
everywhere
for
every
one
had
grown
to
hate
and
fear
him
you
might
have
done
much
good
the
king
told
him
but
you
worked
only
evil
i
shall
keep
you
in
prison
for
many
years
and
see
if
you
will
learn
to
be
good
and
happy
as
well
as
the
wizard
went
back
to
his
dark
little
cell
and
pulled
his
long
beard
all
the
night
long
when
the
sun
peeped
over
the
big
blue
mountains
the
next
morning
he
had
not
closed
his
eyes
like
many
men
wise
and
otherwise
he
knew
better
how
to
manage
other
people
s
affairs
than
his
own
he
had
not
been
able
to
bring
any
charms
away
from
the
cave
he
had
neither
money
nor
friends
and
in
vain
he
racked
his
brain
for
a
way
of
escape
from
his
gloomy
prison
i
hate
men
he
cried
fiercely
why
did
i
ever
become
one
they
are
nothing
but
stupid
animals
i
see
plainly
now
that
it
is
more
honor
to
be
even
a
common
gray
fox
than
the
wisest
man
in
the
world
oh
that
i
had
never
seen
that
miserable
dragon
but
it
did
no
good
to
talk
this
way
he
was
chained
fast
to
the
wall
in
a
horrible
dungeon
with
nothing
but
bread
and
water
to
live
on
and
the
thing
to
worry
about
now
was
how
to
get
out
just
as
he
was
trying
to
think
up
some
plan
there
came
the
sound
of
the
key
turning
in
the
rusty
lock
chapter
iv
the
next
moment
he
was
surprised
to
see
an
ugly
old
woman
coming
toward
him
she
was
dressed
in
a
purple
satin
gown
with
gold
birds
embroidered
upon
it
her
bony
fingers
sparkled
with
rings
a
long
chain
of
pearls
was
around
her
neck
and
he
knew
by
the
crown
on
her
head
that
it
was
the
herself
i
have
heard
that
you
were
very
wise
she
said
peering
at
him
if
that
is
true
why
don
t
you
get
out
of
this
dark
hole
ah
i
could
he
moaned
shaking
his
head
sadly
but
my
charms
are
all
in
the
cave
i
have
there
a
key
that
will
unlock
any
door
a
mantle
that
will
make
the
wearer
invisible
to
mortal
eyes
a
root
that
will
cure
any
disease
a
piece
of
money
that
the
one
who
carries
it
will
never
have
an
empty
pocket
and
there
too
is
the
famous
pearl
that
will
make
the
woman
who
wears
it
seem
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
the
the
old
woman
crept
closer
to
him
what
did
you
say
about
a
pearl
she
whispered
breathlessly
ah
it
is
a
pearl
fit
for
a
queen
he
said
pursing
up
his
lips
it
is
big
as
the
egg
of
a
swan
shaped
like
a
perfect
pear
and
white
as
a
dragon
s
tooth
the
woman
who
wears
it
hung
around
her
neck
all
men
will
adore
she
will
always
be
young
always
the
loveliest
lady
that
was
ever
the
eyes
of
the
queen
glittered
greedily
where
is
that
pearl
wizard
she
asked
grasping
his
arm
so
tightly
that
her
fingers
dug
into
his
flesh
but
the
wizard
only
smiled
the
wise
man
tells
not
all
he
knows
he
answered
she
caught
him
by
the
shoulders
and
shook
him
fiercely
speak
speak
she
commanded
tell
me
where
you
keep
this
priceless
pearl
or
i
will
have
your
tongue
torn
out
by
the
that
would
be
a
pity
he
said
calmly
then
the
pearl
would
never
be
found
and
no
woman
would
have
the
glory
of
being
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
the
the
old
woman
screwed
up
her
wrinkled
face
and
tapped
her
foot
impatiently
on
the
stone
floor
then
she
said
with
a
cunning
leer
if
that
pearl
were
mine
so
great
is
the
power
of
beauty
i
would
rule
the
land
in
place
of
my
the
king
then
would
you
be
my
chief
counsellor
and
next
to
me
in
authority
which
surely
would
be
better
than
spending
all
your
years
in
a
dark
dungeon
where
no
one
will
ever
hear
of
your
wisdom
you
could
live
in
my
palace
and
have
many
servants
to
wait
upon
you
and
if
i
were
the
most
beautiful
woman
you
could
become
the
richest
man
in
the
kingdom
it
would
be
a
sad
thing
for
the
pearl
to
crumble
away
and
never
be
worn
by
a
woman
and
also
for
the
great
cave
man
to
die
a
wretched
death
perhaps
of
hunger
in
this
dirty
if
i
were
only
free
i
could
bring
you
the
pearl
the
wizard
answered
no
one
save
me
can
ever
get
it
for
it
is
watched
by
a
dragon
with
eyes
that
are
always
open
and
teeth
that
are
sharp
and
the
queen
looked
at
the
door
she
had
just
unlocked
i
have
the
key
she
said
thoughtfully
but
there
is
not
only
the
jailer
without
but
many
guards
that
you
must
you
have
much
gold
he
suggested
and
yet
that
pearl
is
worth
more
to
a
woman
than
all
the
gold
and
jewels
of
the
earth
it
will
bring
her
everything
her
heart
she
shook
her
head
i
can
not
buy
all
the
guards
she
told
him
some
of
them
are
old
and
faithful
servants
of
the
king
you
must
find
some
other
you
speak
of
ways
as
if
they
were
easy
to
find
he
grumbled
and
his
heart
again
felt
heavy
in
his
breast
they
should
be
for
a
wise
man
she
tauntingly
replied
surely
you
must
have
left
your
wits
in
the
cave
too
but
i
must
be
off
the
king
gives
a
banquet
in
honor
of
his
bride
who
is
called
the
fairest
creature
of
the
flowery
kingdom
and
she
likes
that
better
than
the
name
of
stay
cried
the
wizard
quickly
the
way
is
found
know
you
the
weed
with
the
purple
flower
that
has
crimson
dots
on
its
petals
a
weed
with
glossy
pointed
leaves
that
grows
by
every
wayside
and
sends
out
a
strange
perfume
after
the
sun
goes
down
the
queen
nodded
well
squeeze
the
juice
from
the
stem
of
this
weed
a
few
drops
of
that
in
the
wine
and
all
the
castle
will
fall
into
sleep
so
deep
that
though
i
rode
away
on
a
prancing
steed
no
one
would
hear
me
see
that
my
keepers
drink
of
that
wine
then
open
my
door
unloose
my
chains
and
leave
the
rest
to
the
old
woman
cackled
in
her
thin
shrill
voice
suddenly
she
stopped
and
looked
at
him
suspiciously
but
you
will
return
she
questioned
you
will
bring
that
precious
pearl
to
me
if
you
stayed
away
you
would
be
searched
for
in
every
corner
of
the
land
you
could
not
escape
my
vengeance
no
matter
how
clever
you
were
the
officers
of
the
king
would
one
day
find
you
even
as
they
found
you
this
time
and
when
you
were
caught
your
head
would
be
brought
back
to
court
remember
my
words
cave
man
if
you
play
me
only
let
me
get
out
and
if
i
do
not
return
you
are
welcome
to
the
head
of
the
wisest
man
in
the
kingdom
he
told
her
but
you
must
give
me
seven
days
three
to
go
three
to
come
back
and
one
day
to
persuade
the
dragon
to
give
me
the
pearl
for
he
is
a
jealous
monster
and
ugly
when
he
is
roused
it
will
not
be
an
easy
matter
to
get
him
to
give
me
his
treasure
and
no
one
can
steal
it
from
him
after
the
sun
has
set
on
the
seventh
day
i
will
stand
before
you
wearing
my
magic
mantle
i
will
slip
by
the
soldiers
and
the
guards
like
a
puff
of
wind
and
no
one
will
see
me
pass
no
one
hear
my
footsteps
and
because
this
time
i
will
have
all
my
charms
with
me
no
man
can
harm
me
and
i
will
bring
you
the
greatest
gift
that
was
ever
given
to
a
still
chuckling
to
herself
the
old
woman
unlocked
the
door
of
the
little
cell
and
slipped
away
when
she
had
gone
the
wizard
laughed
until
his
chains
rattled
then
he
lay
down
on
the
hard
floor
and
fell
into
a
peaceful
sleep
that
night
the
banquet
in
the
king
s
palace
was
a
merry
affair
and
when
the
rejoicing
was
at
its
height
the
came
in
and
said
let
us
send
wine
to
all
the
servants
and
to
the
jailers
and
even
to
the
guards
without
that
they
may
all
drink
to
the
health
of
the
lovely
good
good
cried
the
king
as
he
raised
his
cup
on
high
every
one
in
the
whole
city
shall
have
food
and
drink
let
it
be
given
freely
to
but
the
eyes
of
many
were
already
so
heavy
that
they
forgot
to
cheer
his
words
and
soon
one
by
one
they
fell
over
as
they
sat
eating
and
rolled
upon
the
floor
at
last
even
the
king
was
overcome
and
went
fast
asleep
in
his
great
carved
chair
with
his
crown
awry
and
all
of
the
servants
having
had
much
wine
lay
at
their
posts
like
dead
men
when
all
was
still
the
ran
to
the
prison
and
taking
the
keys
from
the
waist
of
the
sleeping
jailer
unlocked
the
wizard
s
cell
he
was
expecting
her
and
he
cried
impatiently
you
were
long
in
coming
the
people
everywhere
will
soon
be
astir
and
they
will
capture
me
and
bring
me
again
to
the
king
if
they
meet
me
on
my
way
to
the
for
he
did
not
want
her
to
know
that
he
was
going
straight
to
the
haunted
forest
while
he
talked
she
had
unfastened
his
chains
with
trembling
hands
go
go
she
entreated
there
is
not
a
moment
to
be
lost
even
now
the
fireflies
are
putting
out
their
lights
and
waiting
for
the
dawn
see
here
is
gold
to
pay
for
your
journey
and
food
to
last
you
for
a
week
hurry
back
to
me
with
the
wonderful
pearl
and
when
i
am
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
the
land
you
shall
be
the
greatest
when
i
return
you
shall
be
in
truth
the
fairest
woman
men
ever
looked
upon
he
promised
solemnly
then
he
wrapped
his
cloak
about
him
and
bowed
himself
from
her
presence
when
he
was
out
of
sight
of
the
old
lady
he
laughed
to
himself
and
ran
like
a
shadow
through
the
sleeping
town
on
and
on
he
went
over
the
fertile
plain
of
sweet
flags
and
through
the
long
fields
of
waving
rice
never
once
stopping
to
get
his
breath
until
he
stood
on
the
bank
of
the
river
there
he
found
a
boat
fastened
to
the
shore
and
soon
he
was
rowing
up
the
stream
with
all
his
might
but
not
yet
was
he
safe
because
so
many
people
throughout
the
country
knew
the
cave
man
and
hated
him
he
was
in
constant
fear
of
being
seen
in
the
daytime
he
hid
in
the
tall
rushes
on
the
river
bank
and
slept
and
all
the
night
he
plied
his
oars
with
feverish
zeal
until
his
hands
were
blistered
and
his
back
about
to
break
once
a
party
of
fishermen
came
so
close
to
the
reedy
shore
where
he
lay
trembling
that
he
could
hear
every
word
they
said
and
what
he
heard
did
not
make
him
any
more
comfortable
the
king
has
offered
a
great
price
for
the
head
of
the
cave
man
said
one
and
men
are
hunting
all
over
the
island
for
him
even
if
he
were
a
needle
they
would
find
him
on
the
night
of
the
great
banquet
he
cast
a
spell
on
the
court
and
caused
every
one
to
fall
asleep
then
he
opened
his
prison
door
and
ran
away
now
the
king
will
know
no
peace
until
he
is
dead
and
whoever
brings
his
head
to
the
city
will
be
a
rich
man
for
i
wish
i
could
be
the
lucky
one
said
another
i
ve
been
looking
in
every
boat
for
it
seemed
to
the
frightened
cave
man
they
must
hear
his
heart
beating
so
near
he
was
and
perhaps
they
would
had
they
not
been
so
busy
talking
when
at
last
they
went
away
he
did
not
dare
to
move
for
a
long
time
and
that
night
he
rowed
harder
and
faster
than
ever
when
the
morning
of
the
sixth
day
dawned
he
cried
aloud
for
joy
for
in
the
dim
light
he
saw
the
familiar
shadows
of
napatantutu
when
he
had
come
nearer
even
within
the
shade
of
the
great
trees
and
the
overhanging
vines
he
leaped
out
of
the
boat
and
as
soon
as
his
feet
had
touched
the
ground
started
toward
the
home
of
the
dragon
he
had
thrown
away
his
cloak
his
food
his
gold
for
he
no
longer
had
need
of
them
once
more
he
was
to
be
free
in
the
wood
all
was
silent
and
lone
not
even
a
bird
was
stirring
as
he
sped
over
the
cool
wet
grass
the
daylight
had
not
yet
crept
through
the
thick
leaves
and
once
he
stumbled
over
a
dead
log
and
rolled
headlong
into
a
muddy
hole
the
only
light
he
saw
came
from
a
frog
who
had
filled
himself
with
fireflies
and
they
now
shone
through
his
round
stomach
like
a
shaded
lamp
as
he
slept
under
a
sheltering
bush
the
darkness
was
just
stealing
away
when
he
came
to
the
big
hollow
tree
and
knocked
twice
alas
most
powerful
one
i
am
here
again
he
cried
as
the
dragon
writhed
slowly
out
it
is
quite
as
bad
to
be
a
wise
man
as
a
pretty
woman
one
is
stupid
the
other
useless
a
fox
is
a
far
finer
creature
than
either
of
them
so
make
me
a
fox
again
o
mightiest
of
living
things
and
this
time
will
i
be
content
for
the
thousand
years
to
will
you
never
be
satisfied
snorted
the
dragon
you
are
not
willing
to
be
what
nature
made
you
and
you
don
t
like
anything
i
do
for
you
still
as
you
have
not
yet
been
chased
by
a
dog
i
must
grant
your
wish
but
the
next
time
you
get
into
trouble
you
needn
t
come
to
me
remember
that
and
a
moment
later
a
gray
fox
ran
past
the
hollow
tree
and
with
mighty
leaps
and
bounds
went
crashing
through
the
thicket
chapter
v
again
the
fox
went
back
to
his
old
sly
ways
and
for
a
time
was
quite
pleased
to
be
only
a
fox
and
live
in
beautiful
napantatutu
of
men
and
men
s
ways
he
had
quite
enough
he
was
often
heard
to
say
and
he
would
cock
his
head
to
one
side
and
wink
and
grin
every
time
he
thought
of
the
poor
old
lady
who
was
still
waiting
for
her
pearl
the
animals
came
and
went
and
their
children
and
their
grandchildren
and
their
and
still
he
lived
on
most
foxes
would
have
been
happy
to
have
such
a
quiet
comfortable
time
in
an
enchanted
land
and
wouldn
t
have
found
anything
to
worry
about
but
after
a
few
hundred
years
he
again
got
restless
and
tired
and
nothing
was
good
enough
for
him
he
spent
all
his
time
planning
what
he
would
do
when
he
was
a
fox
with
nine
golden
tails
he
talked
of
nothing
else
and
became
the
greatest
bore
in
the
forest
and
he
made
so
much
fun
of
the
peacock
saying
it
wore
painted
feathers
that
the
poor
bird
got
ashamed
to
spread
its
tail
soon
he
was
shunned
by
all
of
the
animals
the
frog
hopped
away
when
it
saw
him
coming
the
grasshopper
whirred
up
to
the
top
of
the
tallest
tree
the
owls
rolled
their
eyes
at
him
flapped
their
wings
and
away
they
went
and
even
the
lazy
old
tortoise
that
every
day
came
out
to
take
its
nap
in
a
little
spot
of
sunshine
tried
to
crawl
away
in
a
hurry
when
it
heard
him
coming
and
sometimes
in
its
haste
rolled
all
the
way
down
the
river
bank
year
by
year
he
went
from
bad
to
worse
he
found
fault
with
everybody
and
everything
and
was
so
cross
that
after
a
while
he
didn
t
have
a
single
friend
he
not
only
quarreled
with
all
of
his
neighbors
and
snapped
and
snarled
at
every
one
who
spoke
to
him
but
he
greedily
swallowed
any
little
helpless
creatures
that
crossed
his
path
so
that
at
last
all
of
the
animals
hated
him
even
more
than
they
feared
him
then
too
he
refused
to
have
anything
to
do
with
any
other
foxes
that
found
their
way
into
the
peaceful
wood
and
made
their
lives
miserable
with
his
airs
you
are
nothing
but
common
beasts
he
told
them
haughtily
you
will
never
have
even
one
golden
tail
while
i
will
one
day
be
the
wonder
of
the
hadn
t
you
better
wait
until
you
get
your
fine
tails
before
you
brag
so
much
asked
one
saucy
young
fellow
it
may
not
be
any
better
than
being
a
woman
or
a
wizard
or
even
an
old
gray
a
fox
with
nine
golden
tails
is
the
most
magnificent
thing
that
was
ever
seen
or
heard
about
he
snarled
i
will
be
the
king
of
beasts
and
even
men
will
worship
me
and
he
walked
away
switching
his
one
bushy
tail
angrily
and
he
could
only
console
himself
by
thinking
what
a
sad
thing
it
was
not
to
be
appreciated
they
are
all
jealous
of
me
he
told
himself
as
he
didn
t
often
get
a
chance
to
talk
to
any
one
else
and
he
fretted
and
fumed
from
morning
until
night
counting
the
years
that
must
pass
and
he
grew
old
and
thin
worrying
because
the
days
were
so
long
but
everything
comes
if
you
only
wait
long
enough
and
at
last
the
day
came
when
he
was
a
thousand
years
old
he
had
stayed
all
night
by
the
hollow
tree
so
that
he
would
be
on
hand
early
in
the
morning
and
long
before
it
was
day
he
began
to
knock
and
bark
and
call
for
the
dragon
even
before
the
sun
had
touched
the
treetops
the
dragon
came
out
rubbing
its
eyes
sleepily
how
dare
you
wake
me
up
cried
the
angry
creature
blowing
out
fire
and
sparks
and
smoke
until
it
looked
like
a
volcano
this
is
my
thousandth
birthday
and
i
want
my
nine
tails
of
gold
whined
the
fox
you
are
a
blithering
old
bother
roared
the
dragon
you
don
t
know
what
you
want
and
you
don
t
want
anything
after
you
get
it
well
this
is
your
last
visit
to
me
don
t
let
me
ever
see
you
with
another
snort
it
raised
its
forked
tail
all
covered
with
silver
scales
high
above
its
head
opened
its
huge
mouth
and
yawned
furiously
then
it
slowly
wriggled
back
into
its
dark
bed
and
standing
without
was
a
fox
with
nine
big
bright
glittering
golden
tails
never
never
had
such
a
thing
been
seen
by
man
or
beast
even
the
fox
was
stunned
for
a
moment
when
he
found
what
had
happened
to
him
then
he
puffed
out
with
pride
until
he
almost
burst
and
held
his
head
so
high
that
he
nearly
fell
over
backward
he
stood
alone
the
wonder
of
the
whole
world
his
first
thought
was
to
run
and
show
himself
to
all
the
animals
of
the
forest
and
he
started
to
skip
joyfully
away
but
alas
he
was
as
one
rooted
to
the
spot
now
he
found
to
his
horror
that
his
golden
tails
were
so
heavy
he
could
not
walk
much
less
run
he
had
never
thought
about
this
and
he
stood
trembling
in
his
tracks
wondering
just
what
he
would
do
about
it
besides
although
he
knew
they
must
be
very
beautiful
he
could
only
twist
his
head
far
enough
around
to
see
the
tip
end
of
one
of
them
and
he
wanted
so
to
see
them
all
and
know
how
very
grand
he
really
did
look
he
kept
lifting
up
first
one
foot
and
then
another
and
straining
and
tugging
in
his
struggle
to
trot
off
and
let
himself
be
seen
but
never
again
would
he
be
able
to
run
through
the
cool
weeds
and
leap
over
the
streams
and
roll
in
the
soft
moss
and
kick
up
his
heels
in
rustling
beds
of
leaves
for
nine
tails
of
gold
were
an
awful
load
to
carry
as
he
grew
more
used
to
them
he
found
he
could
manage
to
totter
along
with
slow
and
painful
steps
but
it
was
very
hard
work
but
when
he
thought
of
what
the
other
poor
animals
would
think
and
say
when
they
beheld
him
in
all
his
glory
he
again
puffed
out
with
pride
after
all
if
he
couldn
t
get
about
very
well
now
he
would
have
all
of
them
to
wait
upon
him
so
it
didn
t
much
matter
all
he
need
do
was
to
stand
up
and
be
admired
it
is
true
he
wasn
t
a
bit
comfortable
for
the
tails
were
like
lead
and
already
his
poor
back
was
aching
but
still
one
would
be
willing
to
have
to
be
the
most
splendid
creature
on
earth
there
never
had
been
there
never
again
would
be
anything
like
him
he
was
the
one
superb
ornament
of
the
world
he
kept
repeating
this
to
himself
with
much
satisfaction
and
if
he
couldn
t
walk
he
could
ride
in
the
future
on
the
backs
of
his
adoring
slaves
and
perhaps
that
was
better
as
the
fox
strutted
feebly
and
slowly
through
the
leaves
and
over
the
dewy
grass
where
he
had
once
scampered
and
frolicked
suddenly
he
saw
a
procession
of
all
the
creatures
of
the
wood
with
the
monkey
ahead
coming
to
meet
him
for
they
were
very
curious
to
know
if
he
would
get
his
golden
tails
he
stopped
and
stood
silent
and
haughty
waiting
for
them
they
gathered
around
him
but
said
never
a
word
and
so
he
cried
out
shrilly
behold
your
king
i
am
the
most
wonderful
animal
in
all
the
world
never
again
on
land
or
on
sea
will
there
be
bird
or
beast
or
fish
or
fowl
that
can
compare
with
me
stupid
things
that
you
are
fall
down
and
worship
now
what
the
animals
saw
was
not
anything
beautiful
or
wonderful
but
just
the
same
old
gray
fox
with
his
back
bald
in
patches
his
legs
trembling
and
his
body
twisted
crooked
by
the
weight
of
nine
stiff
yellow
tails
that
stuck
out
behind
him
and
the
more
they
looked
at
him
the
funnier
figure
he
cut
as
he
ended
his
proud
speech
he
tried
to
spread
his
magnificent
tails
and
strut
as
he
had
seen
the
peacock
do
but
he
toppled
over
backward
and
kicked
and
squirmed
in
his
efforts
to
get
on
his
feet
again
at
this
the
animals
set
up
a
shout
that
echoed
through
the
forest
the
monkey
laughed
until
he
had
to
hold
on
to
the
limb
of
a
tree
by
his
tail
to
keep
from
falling
off
the
bear
grinned
at
first
and
then
let
out
loud
ha
ha
s
the
hen
cackled
the
owls
the
crickets
chirped
the
pigeons
with
such
glee
they
gurgled
and
choked
the
rooster
crowed
the
parrot
shrieked
the
peafowl
screamed
the
ducks
squawked
the
frogs
croaked
and
young
bellowed
until
the
earth
shook
the
fox
was
at
first
dazed
then
he
thought
that
he
was
so
marvelous
an
object
they
had
all
gone
crazy
at
the
sight
of
him
and
he
waited
for
them
to
come
to
their
senses
when
they
had
quieted
down
a
bit
he
said
scornfully
foolish
things
of
the
wood
i
am
not
going
to
hurt
you
if
you
obey
me
i
shall
treat
you
kindly
but
you
must
find
me
the
daintiest
food
and
carry
me
everywhere
i
wish
to
go
now
hurry
and
get
me
my
but
the
animals
saw
that
a
fox
with
nine
golden
tails
was
but
a
helpless
thing
not
as
much
to
be
feared
as
the
spry
and
snappy
old
fellow
they
had
known
for
so
many
years
so
some
of
them
laughed
and
some
of
them
sat
down
to
watch
him
obey
me
he
screamed
his
tongue
hanging
out
with
rage
there
never
before
was
anything
made
like
no
because
you
are
useless
said
the
tortoise
a
fox
with
nine
golden
tails
is
the
greatest
thing
in
the
world
he
went
on
not
noticing
the
tortoise
how
do
we
know
they
are
not
brass
tails
asked
the
owl
and
winked
wisely
and
who
is
going
to
keep
them
polished
asked
the
practical
ant
who
was
known
as
a
good
housekeeper
who
hooted
the
owl
not
i
said
the
grasshopper
promptly
for
he
was
afraid
of
work
the
fox
puzzled
helpless
and
angry
could
only
grit
his
teeth
and
glare
at
them
a
spider
remembering
how
he
had
killed
her
whole
family
with
a
blow
of
his
paw
crept
up
and
stung
his
leg
the
wee
soft
rabbits
that
he
knew
were
such
toothsome
dainties
hopped
around
him
and
laid
back
their
pretty
pink
ears
and
sniffed
the
fat
and
fuzzy
little
chickens
who
had
been
taught
to
hide
under
mother
s
wing
and
hold
their
breath
when
he
came
in
sight
now
flapped
their
baby
wings
under
his
very
nose
and
then
ran
away
and
cried
peep
peep
at
him
and
the
monkey
giggled
and
threw
a
nut
that
hit
one
of
his
fine
tails
a
sounding
whack
for
once
the
quick
wit
of
the
fox
deserted
him
he
could
only
turn
up
his
nose
and
snarl
slowly
for
he
was
trying
with
all
his
might
to
plan
what
to
do
next
he
was
the
richest
fox
in
the
world
the
only
living
creature
with
nine
golden
tails
but
what
good
were
they
to
him
if
these
silly
creatures
would
not
wait
on
him
and
worship
him
in
all
the
years
he
had
lived
among
them
he
had
been
greedy
and
selfish
and
cross
and
ugly
and
now
he
had
not
a
single
friend
but
he
didn
t
blame
himself
he
blamed
them
and
the
rage
shut
up
within
him
boiled
and
bubbled
until
he
foamed
at
the
mouth
how
he
hated
every
one
of
them
oh
if
he
could
only
take
off
his
golden
tails
long
enough
to
whip
the
saucy
monkey
and
how
very
nice
one
of
those
downy
little
chicks
would
taste
i
have
all
the
gold
in
the
wood
he
said
at
last
i
am
your
king
and
you
are
too
stupid
to
know
only
men
are
ruled
by
a
man
because
he
has
gold
said
the
wise
old
tortoise
we
know
better
had
you
been
brave
and
kind
and
good
we
would
now
be
proud
of
you
but
you
have
thought
only
of
yourself
now
help
yourself
you
have
all
that
you
wanted
be
as
it
is
daylight
i
don
t
see
very
well
said
the
owl
blinking
but
it
doesn
t
seem
to
me
that
you
are
any
handsomer
with
your
nine
golden
tails
than
you
were
with
your
old
gray
the
fox
started
could
he
believe
his
ears
not
any
handsomer
than
any
common
fox
he
who
had
nine
wonderful
glittering
tails
of
purest
gold
you
are
jealous
of
me
jealous
jealous
he
barked
but
as
the
animals
did
nothing
but
laugh
a
great
fear
came
over
him
perhaps
after
all
his
tails
were
put
on
wrong
it
had
really
been
quite
dark
when
the
dragon
came
out
and
as
he
was
not
used
to
giving
away
golden
tails
he
might
have
made
a
mistake
and
stuck
them
on
backward
something
surely
was
the
matter
with
them
he
must
go
to
the
river
at
once
and
see
for
himself
but
he
who
had
once
been
so
light
of
foot
that
he
hardly
left
a
track
in
the
softest
mud
as
he
skipped
along
now
found
it
very
very
hard
to
get
across
the
little
strip
of
grass
and
weeds
that
lay
between
him
and
the
forest
mirror
he
put
forth
every
bit
of
his
strength
and
swayed
and
tottered
along
and
all
the
animals
followed
him
scampering
and
laughing
and
pushing
and
shoving
each
other
and
when
he
at
last
reached
the
bank
squirm
and
twist
as
he
would
he
could
not
get
a
glimpse
of
himself
he
screwed
his
head
around
until
his
throat
hurt
he
twisted
his
thin
body
until
his
ribs
stuck
out
he
stood
on
three
legs
and
fell
over
on
his
nose
trying
to
stand
on
two
but
always
the
tails
seemed
to
turn
around
the
wrong
way
and
the
very
best
he
could
do
was
to
see
one
of
them
the
animals
kept
making
fun
of
him
as
they
watched
him
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
them
politely
asked
the
bear
do
you
have
to
wear
them
all
the
time
quacked
the
goose
oh
no
he
is
going
to
lend
them
to
the
tortoise
sometimes
snickered
the
monkey
the
fox
who
had
almost
tied
himself
into
a
knot
in
his
efforts
to
throw
a
proper
shadow
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
notice
them
one
tail
is
enough
for
me
screamed
the
peacock
as
he
spread
his
shimmering
fan
and
danced
until
he
got
so
he
had
to
stop
my
grandmother
who
was
nine
hundred
if
she
was
a
day
told
me
it
wasn
t
any
fun
to
be
better
than
anybody
else
said
the
parrot
snapping
his
bill
one
got
so
dreadfully
but
the
fox
only
turned
his
head
first
to
one
side
and
then
to
the
other
in
his
struggle
to
find
out
how
he
looked
he
strained
and
tugged
until
his
tongue
hung
out
and
water
dripped
from
his
jaws
he
tried
so
hard
to
move
his
stiff
tails
that
his
muscles
cracked
and
all
the
time
he
kept
backing
out
out
until
he
stood
on
the
very
tip
edge
of
the
high
bank
but
he
was
so
busy
looking
for
his
shadow
that
he
never
thought
about
anything
else
and
suddenly
the
dirt
crumbled
under
his
feet
and
without
a
moment
s
warning
he
tumbled
backward
into
the
river
with
such
a
mighty
splash
and
splutter
that
all
the
animals
got
a
shower
when
he
hit
the
water
he
struck
out
with
all
four
of
his
feet
for
he
was
a
good
swimmer
but
the
tails
of
gold
were
like
iron
weights
upon
his
back
and
he
only
churned
the
water
into
foam
as
he
kicked
and
snorted
then
with
one
great
struggle
that
sent
the
ripples
flying
in
every
direction
he
shot
down
like
a
torpedo
to
the
very
bottom
of
the
deep
river
and
he
never
came
up
again
the
animals
shrieked
and
ran
to
the
river
bank
the
stork
who
had
been
standing
on
one
leg
all
the
morning
took
down
his
other
in
a
hurry
and
hopped
over
into
the
rushes
where
he
stretched
his
long
neck
as
far
as
ever
he
could
and
peeped
into
the
muddy
stream
the
monkey
wrapped
his
tail
around
a
bush
to
keep
from
falling
as
he
screwed
up
one
eye
and
tried
in
vain
to
see
what
had
become
of
the
fox
toppled
off
the
bank
in
his
fright
and
made
another
splash
a
fish
not
knowing
what
to
make
of
so
much
noise
jumped
out
in
the
grass
and
turned
a
somersault
the
owl
snapped
both
his
glassy
eyes
but
saw
nothing
the
bullfrog
dived
down
as
far
as
he
could
and
came
up
coughing
and
choking
but
the
fox
golden
tails
and
all
was
gone
forever
he
made
a
plunge
where
the
stream
was
deep
and
saw
too
late
his
blunder
for
he
had
hardly
time
to
peep
before
his
foolish
head
went
under
sadly
said
the
tortoise
who
prided
himself
on
knowing
a
lot
of
real
poetry
but
the
rabbit
winked
his
long
ears
and
whispered
to
the
ant
good
riddance
once
again
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
years
went
by
as
they
always
do
if
you
wait
a
while
every
animal
that
had
known
the
poor
fox
had
been
dead
a
long
time
and
those
that
came
after
them
told
this
tale
as
i
have
told
it
to
you
only
they
weren
t
quite
certain
it
was
true
and
some
of
the
young
beasts
said
it
was
nothing
but
a
fairy
story
but
one
day
a
pearl
fisher
came
up
the
river
in
his
little
boat
and
while
he
was
diving
down
in
the
deepest
part
of
the
water
he
found
a
object
sticking
up
in
the
mud
and
when
he
had
brought
it
ashore
and
washed
and
scrubbed
it
he
found
it
was
a
tail
of
pure
gold
hardly
believing
his
good
fortune
he
took
it
away
with
him
and
many
wise
men
looked
at
it
through
spectacles
and
microscopes
and
weighed
it
and
thumped
it
and
tasted
it
and
wrote
long
papers
about
it
filled
with
so
many
big
words
that
no
one
ever
read
them
and
you
may
see
this
very
same
tail
looking
rather
old
and
rusty
in
one
of
the
museums
of
a
foreign
city
and
beside
it
is
a
card
telling
that
this
is
undoubtedly
the
golden
feather
that
the
great
king
of
japan
once
wore
in
his
crown
which
shows
that
even
very
wise
people
sometimes
make
mistakes
but
it
was
the
fairy
godmother
to
the
poor
pearl
diver
who
sold
it
for
so
much
money
that
he
was
able
to
buy
a
cozy
little
bamboo
cottage
for
his
family
and
to
ever
after
give
them
as
much
as
they
wanted
to
eat
and
so
one
of
the
tails
of
the
fox
did
some
good
in
the
world
after
all
the
end
