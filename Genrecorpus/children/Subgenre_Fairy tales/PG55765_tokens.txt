chapter
i
the
knight
once
upon
a
time
there
might
have
been
seen
a
gentle
knight
riding
across
the
plain
he
was
clad
in
armour
of
proof
and
on
his
arm
he
carried
a
silver
shield
a
shield
it
was
that
brave
men
had
carried
before
him
for
there
were
great
dints
upon
it
which
were
as
a
witness
of
great
fights
that
had
been
fought
now
the
knight
himself
had
never
yet
been
in
battle
but
he
seemed
as
one
who
could
bear
himself
bravely
so
well
did
he
sit
upon
his
horse
and
so
stout
of
limb
he
was
on
his
breast
he
wore
a
cross
red
as
blood
in
token
that
he
was
vowed
to
serve
the
lord
christ
who
had
died
for
him
and
on
his
shield
was
yet
another
cross
to
be
as
it
were
a
sign
that
this
service
should
be
a
defence
to
him
in
all
dangers
somewhat
sad
of
look
he
was
not
as
though
he
had
fear
in
his
heart
but
rather
as
one
upon
whom
had
been
laid
the
burden
of
a
great
task
and
such
in
truth
there
was
for
queen
gloriana
had
sent
him
upon
a
great
enterprise
and
all
his
heart
was
full
of
the
thought
of
how
he
should
best
accomplish
it
and
the
task
was
slay
the
great
dragon
beside
the
knight
a
lady
was
riding
on
an
ass
as
white
as
snow
very
fair
she
was
but
she
hid
her
fairness
under
a
veil
which
was
brought
low
over
her
face
she
was
clad
also
in
a
garment
of
black
and
she
too
was
somewhat
sad
of
look
nor
indeed
without
cause
she
came
of
a
royal
stock
being
descended
from
ancient
kings
and
queens
who
had
held
wide
sway
in
their
land
until
this
same
dragon
had
driven
out
their
ancient
house
and
had
cruelly
wasted
all
their
realm
the
third
of
this
company
was
a
dwarf
who
lagged
behind
wearied
it
may
be
with
the
weight
of
the
bag
in
which
he
bore
this
fair
lady
s
gear
while
the
three
to
wit
the
knight
and
the
lady
and
the
dwarf
passed
on
the
sky
was
suddenly
covered
with
clouds
and
there
began
to
fall
a
great
storm
of
rain
so
that
they
were
fain
to
seek
some
shelter
gladly
then
did
they
espy
a
wood
hard
by
that
promised
so
thickly
grown
it
was
a
shelter
from
the
rain
tall
were
the
trees
and
spreading
wide
with
shady
branches
so
that
neither
sun
by
day
nor
star
by
night
could
pierce
through
and
all
about
were
paths
and
ways
worn
as
by
the
treading
of
many
feet
which
seemed
to
lead
to
the
abodes
of
fairer
place
of
shelter
as
it
seemed
there
scarce
could
be
so
they
passed
along
the
birds
singing
sweetly
the
while
overhead
were
trees
of
many
kinds
trees
of
the
forest
and
of
the
orchard
the
cedar
and
the
oak
and
the
elm
with
the
vine
clinging
to
its
stem
the
yew
for
bows
and
the
birch
for
arrows
and
the
fruitful
olive
so
fair
was
the
place
and
so
full
of
delights
that
the
travellers
took
no
heed
of
the
way
by
which
they
went
so
it
came
to
pass
that
they
strayed
from
the
path
by
which
they
first
entered
the
wood
nor
could
they
win
to
it
again
when
once
they
had
left
it
so
many
were
the
ways
and
so
like
the
one
to
the
other
after
a
time
when
they
had
taken
counsel
together
it
seemed
best
to
choose
the
way
which
seemed
most
trodden
by
the
feet
of
travellers
as
being
the
likeliest
to
lead
to
a
certain
end
when
they
had
followed
this
awhile
they
came
to
a
great
cave
deep
in
the
very
thicket
of
the
wood
here
the
knight
sprang
from
his
horse
and
gave
to
the
dwarf
his
spear
thinking
that
he
should
not
need
it
but
his
sword
he
kept
then
said
the
lady
una
for
that
was
her
name
be
not
overbold
sir
knight
there
may
be
mischief
here
of
which
you
know
nothing
peril
which
gives
no
sign
of
itself
even
as
a
fire
which
burns
without
smoke
hold
back
i
pray
you
till
you
have
made
some
trial
of
the
the
knight
made
reply
fair
lady
it
were
a
shame
to
fall
back
for
fear
of
a
shadow
the
cave
doubtless
is
dark
but
where
there
is
courage
there
is
not
wanting
a
light
for
the
then
said
the
lady
again
nay
nay
sir
knight
i
know
this
place
by
repute
though
i
thought
not
of
it
before
this
wood
in
which
we
are
lost
is
the
wood
of
wandering
this
cave
which
you
see
before
you
is
the
den
of
error
a
monster
hateful
both
to
god
and
man
beware
therefore
beware
and
the
dwarf
cried
out
aloud
in
his
fear
fly
sir
knight
fly
this
is
no
place
for
mortal
but
the
knight
would
not
be
persuaded
he
stepped
into
the
cave
and
the
light
of
day
shining
from
without
on
his
armour
showed
him
dimly
the
monster
that
was
within
hideous
it
was
to
behold
half
a
serpent
and
half
a
woman
and
all
as
foul
as
ever
creature
was
upon
the
earth
or
under
it
all
the
length
of
the
cave
she
lay
her
tail
wound
in
many
coils
and
in
every
coil
there
was
a
deadly
sting
and
all
round
her
was
a
brood
of
young
ones
many
different
shapes
they
had
but
hideous
all
and
as
soon
as
the
light
from
the
knight
s
armour
glimmered
through
the
darkness
they
fled
for
shelter
to
the
mouth
of
their
dam
the
monster
wakened
from
her
sleep
curled
her
tail
about
her
head
and
rushed
to
the
cavern
s
mouth
but
seeing
one
armed
from
top
to
toe
in
shining
mail
would
have
turned
again
but
the
knight
leaped
at
her
fierce
as
a
lion
leaps
upon
his
prey
and
barred
her
backward
way
with
his
sword
first
she
darted
at
him
her
great
tail
and
threatened
him
with
the
deadly
sting
that
lay
in
it
but
he
not
one
whit
dismayed
aimed
at
her
head
a
mighty
blow
her
head
it
wounded
not
but
glanced
on
to
the
neck
with
force
so
great
that
for
a
while
the
great
beast
was
stunned
then
coming
to
herself
she
raised
her
body
high
from
the
ground
and
leaped
upon
the
knight
s
shield
and
wrapped
his
body
round
with
huge
folds
then
una
seeing
in
how
sore
plight
he
was
cried
out
now
show
sir
knight
what
you
are
put
out
all
your
force
and
above
all
things
back
your
force
with
faith
and
be
not
faint
strangle
this
monster
or
surely
she
will
strangle
you
greatly
was
his
heart
stirred
within
him
with
grief
and
anger
and
knitting
all
his
strength
together
he
gripped
the
creature
by
the
throat
so
mightily
that
she
was
constrained
to
loosen
the
bonds
which
she
had
cast
about
him
and
yet
it
had
cost
him
dear
to
come
so
close
to
the
monster
so
foul
she
was
and
of
this
foulness
the
worst
was
this
that
she
caused
to
come
forth
out
of
her
mouth
as
in
a
flood
the
brood
which
had
taken
shelter
therein
at
the
first
serpents
they
were
like
to
their
dam
small
indeed
but
full
of
venom
and
they
swarmed
over
him
twining
themselves
about
his
arms
and
legs
so
that
he
could
not
strike
a
blow
nor
even
move
so
in
some
still
eventide
a
shepherd
sitting
to
watch
his
flock
is
suddenly
assailed
by
a
cloud
of
gnats
feeble
creatures
they
are
and
slight
their
sting
but
they
suffer
him
not
to
rest
the
knight
was
in
a
strait
more
dire
for
these
evil
creatures
had
power
to
do
him
a
more
grievous
harm
but
he
thought
to
himself
shall
i
be
vanquished
in
this
fashion
he
was
somewhat
moved
by
the
danger
wherein
he
stood
but
more
ashamed
that
he
should
be
overcome
in
so
foul
a
fashion
so
resolved
in
his
heart
that
he
would
put
all
his
strength
into
a
stroke
either
to
win
or
to
lose
he
gathered
himself
together
and
struck
the
monster
with
a
blow
so
fierce
that
he
shore
the
head
from
the
body
and
she
fell
dead
upon
the
ground
then
said
the
lady
una
well
indeed
have
you
carried
yourself
sir
knight
surely
you
were
born
under
a
lucky
star
seeing
that
you
have
overcome
so
terrible
a
foe
you
are
worthy
of
these
arms
wherewith
you
are
clad
so
is
your
first
adventure
brought
to
a
good
result
god
grant
that
you
have
many
such
in
the
time
to
come
and
that
they
may
be
brought
to
as
happy
an
then
the
knight
sprang
upon
his
horse
and
the
lady
una
mounted
again
her
ass
and
the
dwarf
followed
as
before
and
now
they
kept
with
steadfast
purpose
to
the
one
way
which
they
saw
to
be
most
trodden
turning
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
how
fair
soever
the
path
might
seem
so
at
last
they
came
to
the
outskirts
of
the
wandering
wood
and
journeyed
once
more
across
the
plain
chapter
ii
archimage
and
duessa
so
the
two
the
knight
and
the
lady
rode
on
the
dwarf
following
as
before
after
a
while
they
chanced
to
meet
an
old
man
by
the
road
he
was
clothed
in
black
and
barefooted
and
he
had
a
long
white
beard
and
a
book
was
hanging
from
his
belt
a
very
wise
old
man
he
seemed
sober
and
even
somewhat
sad
and
as
he
went
along
he
seemed
to
be
praying
and
now
and
again
he
would
beat
upon
his
breast
saying
god
be
merciful
to
me
a
sinner
he
made
a
humble
reverence
to
the
knight
and
the
knight
in
his
courtesy
made
his
salute
and
said
sir
do
you
know
of
any
adventure
that
a
christian
man
may
undertake
my
son
said
the
old
man
how
should
one
who
lives
in
his
cell
and
tells
his
beads
and
does
penance
for
his
sins
know
aught
of
wars
and
enterprises
by
which
glory
may
be
won
nevertheless
i
can
tell
of
a
very
evil
man
who
dwells
in
these
forests
and
wastes
all
the
ah
cried
the
knight
it
is
for
such
an
adventure
the
setting
right
of
wrong
that
i
seek
bring
me
to
this
villain
s
dwelling
and
i
will
reward
you
willingly
said
the
old
man
will
i
guide
you
thither
but
the
way
is
long
and
and
surely
said
the
lady
una
you
are
wearied
with
your
late
encounter
i
take
it
that
he
who
lacks
rest
lacks
strength
however
stout
of
limb
he
be
take
your
rest
then
with
the
sun
and
begin
your
new
work
with
the
new
this
is
wise
counsel
sir
knight
said
the
old
man
and
wise
counsel
ever
wins
the
day
the
day
is
far
spent
come
then
and
take
such
poor
entertainment
as
my
home
can
with
this
the
knight
was
well
content
so
they
followed
the
old
man
to
his
dwelling
it
was
a
lowly
hermitage
in
a
valley
close
to
the
forest
with
a
chapel
hard
by
and
by
this
chapel
a
brook
crystal
clear
humble
was
their
fare
but
the
rest
after
the
day
s
toil
made
it
sweet
enough
as
also
did
the
old
man
s
talk
for
he
discoursed
of
many
things
and
many
men
saints
and
popes
and
the
great
deeds
which
they
had
done
then
as
the
night
drew
on
and
sleep
began
to
fall
upon
their
eyes
he
showed
them
the
places
where
they
should
lodge
for
the
night
now
this
old
man
who
seemed
so
pious
and
good
with
his
long
white
beard
and
his
prayers
and
his
beating
of
his
breast
was
really
a
wicked
magician
so
soon
as
he
had
taken
his
guests
to
their
lodgings
he
went
to
his
study
where
he
kept
his
books
of
charms
with
other
contrivances
of
his
art
and
taking
one
of
these
books
from
the
shelf
on
which
it
stood
opened
it
and
began
to
mutter
some
dreadful
words
which
it
were
a
great
sin
for
anyone
to
write
or
read
with
these
he
brought
up
from
their
in
the
lower
parts
of
the
earth
a
very
legion
of
evil
spirits
to
these
he
gave
a
part
of
his
evil
work
to
do
and
some
of
this
work
he
kept
to
himself
and
the
work
was
this
to
cheat
the
hearts
of
those
whom
he
wished
to
deceive
with
false
dreams
and
visions
what
these
were
it
is
best
not
to
tell
let
it
be
enough
to
say
that
they
wrought
such
doubts
concerning
the
lady
una
in
the
heart
of
the
knight
that
as
soon
as
the
morning
dawned
he
rose
from
his
bed
and
clothed
himself
with
all
haste
and
crying
for
the
dwarf
that
he
should
bring
him
his
horse
rode
away
as
fast
as
the
beast
could
carry
him
he
had
not
ridden
many
miles
before
there
met
him
a
paynim
knight
a
tall
warrior
and
a
strong
he
was
armed
from
top
to
toe
and
carrying
a
great
shield
on
which
were
written
in
scarlet
letters
the
words
which
being
interpreted
mean
without
with
him
there
rode
a
fair
lady
clad
also
in
scarlet
with
ornaments
of
gold
and
necklaces
of
coral
and
on
her
head
a
persian
cap
set
round
with
crowns
of
gold
her
horse
also
had
gay
trappings
and
her
bridle
was
set
with
bells
of
gold
which
tinkled
bravely
as
she
rode
so
soon
as
she
saw
the
knight
she
said
to
her
companion
see
now
here
comes
your
enemy
make
no
sooner
had
she
spoken
but
he
stuck
spurs
in
his
horse
and
rode
at
the
knight
nor
did
the
knight
hold
back
from
the
fray
for
he
also
put
his
spear
in
rest
and
charged
so
the
two
met
fully
and
fairly
with
so
fierce
a
shock
that
the
two
horses
stood
as
it
were
struck
to
stone
and
the
riders
were
borne
backwards
in
their
saddles
holding
each
of
them
in
his
hand
his
broken
spear
then
the
saracen
drew
his
sword
from
the
scabbard
and
addressed
himself
again
to
the
fray
so
did
the
christian
also
blow
for
blow
did
they
deal
one
to
the
other
till
the
sparks
flew
from
their
shields
and
when
they
chanced
to
strike
home
the
blood
flowed
forth
and
dyed
the
earth
under
their
feet
after
a
while
cried
the
saracen
now
curse
upon
that
cross
which
keeps
your
body
from
harm
you
had
been
dead
long
since
but
for
that
magic
power
for
all
that
i
bid
you
now
beware
and
keep
safe
your
head
if
it
may
so
saying
he
dealt
a
blow
so
fierce
that
it
shore
away
half
the
christian
s
crest
yet
glancing
down
upon
the
shield
harmed
him
no
more
yet
was
it
not
struck
in
vain
for
it
roused
him
of
the
red
cross
to
such
rage
that
he
made
a
more
than
like
reply
full
on
the
saracen
s
helmet
he
dealt
his
stroke
right
through
the
steel
it
passed
and
cleft
the
head
so
that
the
saracen
fell
a
dead
man
from
his
horse
when
the
lady
saw
her
champion
fall
not
a
moment
did
she
stay
to
see
how
it
had
fared
with
him
either
to
tend
his
wounds
or
to
weep
for
his
death
but
fled
away
as
fast
as
her
horse
could
carry
her
then
the
knight
crying
to
the
dwarf
that
he
should
pick
up
the
dead
man
s
shield
to
be
a
memorial
of
the
fight
rode
after
her
and
overtaking
her
bade
her
halt
you
have
no
cause
to
fear
fair
lady
he
said
illustration
the
red
cross
knight
and
sansfoy
then
she
turning
back
cried
aloud
fair
sir
have
mercy
on
an
unhappy
woman
much
was
he
moved
to
see
her
humbleness
for
she
was
beautiful
to
look
on
and
richly
clad
as
one
of
noble
birth
might
be
lady
said
he
be
of
good
heart
it
pitieth
me
to
see
you
in
such
distress
tell
me
now
who
you
are
and
whence
you
come
and
who
was
this
your
champion
sir
she
answered
weeping
the
while
i
have
suffered
much
from
evil
fortune
i
was
the
only
daughter
of
an
emperor
who
had
wide
dominion
over
the
land
of
the
west
setting
his
throne
where
flows
the
famous
stream
of
tiber
being
such
i
was
betrothed
in
my
early
youth
to
the
only
son
and
heir
of
a
most
wise
and
mighty
king
never
surely
was
prince
so
fair
and
faithful
as
he
never
one
so
gentle
and
debonair
but
alas
ere
the
day
appointed
for
our
marriage
came
my
lord
fell
into
the
hands
of
cruel
enemies
and
was
most
foully
slain
when
this
ill
news
came
to
me
i
said
to
myself
now
will
i
at
least
do
due
honour
to
the
dear
body
of
him
whom
i
so
i
set
forth
from
my
father
s
house
upon
this
quest
long
did
i
wander
over
the
world
a
virgin
widow
nor
did
i
find
that
for
which
i
sought
at
last
i
chanced
to
meet
this
saracen
who
now
lies
dead
upon
the
plain
he
constrained
me
to
go
with
him
and
would
fain
have
won
me
for
his
wife
but
i
ever
said
him
nay
and
now
he
lies
dead
an
evil
man
he
was
one
of
an
evil
brotherhood
of
the
eldest
sansjoy
the
youngest
and
this
sansfoy
of
middle
age
between
the
be
contented
fair
lady
answered
the
knight
you
have
done
well
you
have
found
a
new
friend
and
lost
an
old
foe
friend
be
he
ever
so
new
is
better
i
trow
than
foe
new
or
so
the
two
rode
on
he
making
merry
with
gay
talk
as
became
a
courteous
knight
and
she
with
much
modest
show
of
bashfulness
after
a
while
they
came
in
their
journey
to
two
fair
trees
which
spread
their
branches
across
the
road
lovely
trees
they
seemed
and
fair
was
the
shade
which
they
cast
yet
was
the
place
held
in
of
all
the
never
did
shepherd
sit
beneath
them
to
rest
or
play
upon
his
oaten
pipe
for
all
men
held
it
to
be
unlucky
ground
but
of
this
the
good
knight
knew
nothing
so
the
sun
being
now
high
in
heaven
and
of
so
fierce
a
heat
that
a
man
might
scarcely
abide
it
he
dismounted
and
bade
the
lady
do
likewise
so
that
they
might
rest
awhile
and
anon
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
might
pursue
their
journey
so
the
two
sat
them
down
and
talked
now
the
knight
being
in
a
merry
mood
said
to
himself
surely
this
is
the
fairest
of
women
it
is
meet
that
she
should
be
so
saying
he
plucked
a
branch
which
he
would
have
shaped
into
a
garland
for
the
lady
s
head
then
lo
from
the
place
where
the
branch
had
been
plucked
came
trickling
drops
of
blood
and
there
issued
forth
a
lamentable
voice
which
said
stranger
tear
not
in
this
cruel
fashion
the
tender
human
limbs
which
are
covered
by
the
bark
of
this
tree
fly
also
from
the
place
fly
lest
haply
the
same
fate
should
come
upon
you
as
came
upon
me
in
this
place
both
on
me
and
on
the
dear
lady
also
who
was
my
much
was
the
knight
astonished
to
hear
such
words
and
for
a
while
he
stood
speechless
then
he
said
what
ghost
is
this
from
the
world
below
what
wandering
spirit
that
talks
in
this
strange
fashion
then
there
came
this
answer
no
ghost
am
i
from
the
nether
world
nor
wandering
spirit
of
the
air
i
was
a
man
fradubio
by
name
as
now
i
am
a
tree
being
charmed
by
the
arts
of
a
wicked
witch
but
i
am
yet
a
man
for
i
feel
the
winter
cold
and
the
summer
heat
in
these
branches
even
as
a
man
might
then
said
the
knight
tell
me
now
fradubio
be
you
tree
or
man
how
you
came
to
suffer
in
this
fashion
it
is
good
for
a
man
to
tell
his
trouble
he
who
hides
it
in
his
heart
makes
his
griefs
to
be
twice
as
then
did
fradubio
tell
his
tale
know
stranger
that
i
suffer
this
trouble
through
the
arts
of
a
false
sorceress
duessa
by
name
nor
i
only
for
she
has
brought
many
knights
into
a
like
evil
case
in
my
youth
which
indeed
is
not
long
passed
i
loved
a
fair
lady
whom
you
may
see
not
indeed
in
the
fashion
of
a
lady
but
as
yonder
tree
which
joins
its
branches
with
these
once
upon
a
time
when
i
was
riding
abroad
with
her
i
chanced
to
meet
a
knight
who
also
had
a
fair
lady
for
a
companion
a
fair
lady
i
called
her
and
so
she
seemed
but
she
was
in
truth
this
same
false
witch
duessa
said
the
strange
knight
i
do
declare
that
this
lady
is
the
fairest
dame
in
all
the
world
and
this
i
will
make
good
with
my
sword
and
spear
against
all
the
for
the
witch
had
cast
her
spells
over
him
and
deceived
him
and
when
i
put
forth
the
same
challenge
for
my
own
lady
we
fell
to
fighting
and
he
fared
so
ill
that
he
fell
by
my
hand
so
now
there
were
two
fair
ladies
for
so
it
seemed
fraelissa
who
was
fair
in
truth
and
duessa
who
by
her
wicked
arts
had
made
herself
so
to
seem
and
i
knew
not
to
which
i
should
give
the
prize
of
beauty
for
it
seemed
the
due
of
each
but
while
i
doubted
this
wicked
witch
raised
by
evil
arts
such
a
mist
as
made
fraelissa
s
face
to
lose
all
its
fairness
which
when
she
had
accomplished
she
cried
see
now
how
this
false
dame
has
lost
her
beauty
for
indeed
it
was
but
borrowed
many
has
she
deceived
in
time
past
even
as
now
she
has
deceived
when
i
heard
this
i
would
fain
have
killed
the
fair
lady
that
had
been
my
true
love
but
this
the
false
duessa
feigning
compassion
would
not
suffer
only
with
her
magic
arts
she
changed
her
into
that
tree
which
you
see
yonder
now
you
must
know
that
for
every
witch
be
she
as
crafty
as
she
may
there
is
one
day
in
every
year
when
she
is
constrained
to
take
her
true
shape
and
on
this
day
i
chanced
to
see
duessa
as
she
was
in
truth
old
and
foul
of
hue
fouler
than
one
had
thought
woman
could
be
nor
did
she
fail
to
perceive
that
i
had
discovered
the
truth
though
indeed
i
sought
to
bear
myself
as
before
having
it
in
my
mind
secretly
to
escape
and
fly
from
her
company
so
she
practised
upon
me
the
same
wicked
arts
that
she
had
used
with
my
fraelissa
changing
me
into
the
semblance
of
a
tree
and
here
we
stand
banished
from
the
company
of
men
and
wasting
weary
days
and
but
said
the
knight
how
long
shall
this
endure
what
is
the
appointed
end
of
your
sufferings
we
must
here
abide
till
we
shall
be
bathed
in
a
living
well
fradubio
made
answer
can
i
find
this
same
well
asked
the
knight
that
shall
be
as
the
fates
may
decree
said
fradubio
all
this
called
herself
and
knew
it
for
truth
she
fainted
for
fear
but
the
time
for
the
discovering
of
her
falseness
was
not
yet
chapter
iii
the
fortunes
of
una
while
the
knight
was
thus
faring
the
lady
una
was
not
a
little
troubled
that
she
should
have
been
so
left
by
her
champion
never
did
she
cease
to
search
for
him
wandering
the
while
over
plain
and
forest
and
mountain
and
not
one
whit
afraid
however
desolate
they
were
on
a
certain
day
she
lighted
off
the
ass
on
which
she
was
wont
to
ride
and
laid
herself
down
to
rest
in
a
solitary
place
under
the
shadow
of
a
tree
she
took
the
covering
from
her
head
and
laid
aside
her
black
cloak
her
faithful
beast
grazed
hard
by
for
there
was
much
grass
in
the
place
as
she
lay
there
rushed
out
of
the
wood
with
which
the
meadow
was
circled
about
a
furious
lion
wild
he
was
with
hunger
and
was
hunting
for
prey
and
when
he
saw
the
royal
maid
he
ran
greedily
at
her
with
open
mouth
as
if
he
would
have
devoured
her
but
when
he
came
near
and
saw
what
manner
of
maid
she
was
all
his
rage
departed
from
him
he
kissed
her
weary
feet
and
licked
with
his
tongue
her
lily
hands
crouching
down
before
her
as
if
to
show
himself
her
servant
at
the
first
sight
of
the
beast
the
lady
una
was
not
a
little
afraid
but
when
she
saw
how
gently
he
bore
himself
she
sighed
and
said
see
now
how
this
lion
who
is
the
king
of
the
forest
forgets
his
hunger
and
his
rage
in
pity
of
my
sad
state
while
he
who
was
my
champion
leaves
me
to
wander
so
she
spake
till
she
could
speak
no
more
for
very
tears
and
the
lion
meanwhile
stood
looking
upon
her
the
lady
was
of
a
brave
shut
up
her
sorrows
in
her
heart
and
mounted
on
her
steed
again
and
set
out
once
more
upon
her
quest
it
was
a
long
and
weary
way
which
she
went
through
divers
places
where
there
were
no
inhabitants
and
still
the
lion
went
with
her
ready
to
guard
her
against
all
dangers
while
she
slept
he
watched
over
her
and
when
she
awaked
he
awaited
her
command
watching
her
eyes
so
that
he
might
discern
her
pleasure
after
long
journeying
in
which
they
saw
no
sign
of
the
presence
of
man
they
came
to
a
place
which
from
the
wearing
of
the
grass
seemed
to
be
trodden
by
human
feet
and
in
no
long
time
the
lady
espied
a
woman
who
was
following
the
path
with
slow
steps
and
carrying
on
her
head
a
pitcher
of
water
the
lady
cried
to
her
tell
me
now
my
friend
whether
there
may
be
any
dwelling
near
to
hand
where
i
may
rest
awhile
but
the
woman
answered
her
never
a
word
seeming
as
if
she
could
neither
understand
nor
speak
but
when
turning
her
eyes
she
saw
the
lion
by
the
lady
s
side
she
threw
down
her
pitcher
and
fled
as
fast
as
her
feet
could
carry
her
not
once
did
she
look
behind
her
but
fled
as
if
for
her
life
till
she
came
to
the
house
where
she
dwelt
with
her
mother
a
blind
woman
not
a
word
did
she
say
but
her
fear
was
plain
to
see
and
the
old
woman
perceived
that
there
was
some
great
danger
at
hand
so
when
they
two
had
shut
the
door
they
hid
themselves
in
the
darkest
corner
of
the
cottage
in
a
short
space
of
time
came
una
and
her
lion
to
the
door
thereat
the
lady
knocked
but
when
no
one
answered
and
the
time
was
passing
the
lion
in
his
impatience
rent
the
with
his
claws
and
let
her
in
no
further
hurt
did
he
and
when
una
had
with
much
gentle
speech
allayed
the
women
s
fear
they
laid
themselves
down
to
sleep
but
when
the
night
was
far
spent
there
came
one
to
the
door
demanding
entrance
and
when
this
was
not
speedily
given
him
using
many
oaths
and
curses
he
was
a
sturdy
thief
by
name
kirkrapine
that
is
to
say
robber
of
churches
and
this
indeed
was
his
trade
he
was
wont
to
steal
away
the
ornaments
of
churches
and
to
strip
off
from
the
images
of
the
saints
the
vestments
with
which
they
were
clad
and
to
purloin
the
robes
of
the
priests
and
to
break
open
the
boxes
in
which
were
put
the
alms
for
the
poor
no
small
share
of
the
plunder
did
he
bring
to
the
house
where
una
lay
that
night
for
he
was
the
lover
of
the
old
woman
s
daughter
and
he
could
never
give
her
enough
of
gold
and
jewels
and
precious
things
but
whether
the
old
woman
knew
of
the
matter
none
can
tell
though
it
might
have
seemed
that
such
doings
were
not
to
her
mind
seeing
that
she
told
her
beads
and
prayed
both
by
day
and
by
night
nine
hundred
paternosters
would
she
say
daily
and
of
ave
marias
twice
as
many
thrice
in
the
week
also
did
she
sit
in
ashes
thrice
three
times
she
fasted
from
all
food
and
drink
and
she
wore
sackcloth
nearest
to
her
skin
now
when
this
same
kirkrapine
found
that
for
all
his
cursing
he
could
not
win
an
entrance
for
indeed
though
the
women
heard
him
they
were
hindered
from
rising
by
fear
of
the
lion
he
let
fly
furiously
at
the
door
and
brake
it
down
and
would
have
entered
but
as
he
was
about
to
cross
the
threshold
the
beast
thinking
that
his
lady
was
in
danger
sprang
at
him
and
brought
him
to
the
ground
and
so
tore
him
that
he
died
which
having
done
the
lion
came
back
to
his
place
by
the
lady
s
side
and
watched
her
as
before
when
the
day
broke
the
lady
una
rose
from
her
place
and
went
forth
from
the
cottage
and
journeyed
onwards
still
seeking
the
knight
and
the
lion
went
with
her
the
old
woman
also
and
her
daughter
so
soon
as
the
house
was
clear
of
its
guests
rose
up
but
when
they
found
kirkrapine
lying
dead
before
the
door
great
was
their
grief
and
greater
still
their
anger
this
they
cried
the
savage
beast
has
done
and
they
followed
with
all
the
speed
they
might
use
and
so
overtook
her
harm
her
they
might
not
for
they
feared
the
lion
and
when
they
had
cursed
her
loud
and
long
they
turned
back
to
go
to
their
own
house
as
they
went
they
met
a
knight
fully
clad
in
armour
but
yet
he
was
no
knight
but
only
the
wizard
archimage
who
had
taken
upon
himself
by
help
of
his
wicked
arts
the
semblance
of
the
knight
the
false
knight
asked
them
whether
they
had
seen
a
lady
journeying
alone
yea
the
old
woman
answered
such
i
have
seen
an
evil
woman
she
is
and
much
harm
hath
she
and
she
told
a
piteous
tale
of
the
things
which
she
had
suffered
this
done
she
showed
him
the
way
by
which
he
must
go
if
he
would
overtake
the
lady
and
he
having
thanked
her
with
due
courtesy
rode
on
nor
was
it
long
before
he
overtook
the
lady
una
for
she
having
but
an
ass
for
her
steed
travelled
slowly
when
she
saw
him
and
noted
the
red
cross
on
his
shield
and
the
like
emblem
on
his
breast
she
said
to
herself
now
god
be
thanked
i
see
my
true
champion
again
and
she
rode
to
meet
him
and
greeted
him
with
friendly
words
saying
where
have
you
been
these
weary
days
my
lord
i
have
fared
ill
without
your
company
and
she
told
him
of
all
the
troubles
and
dangers
through
which
she
had
passed
on
the
other
hand
the
false
knight
spoke
her
fair
for
this
cause
i
left
you
dearest
lady
that
i
might
seek
an
adventure
of
which
archimage
told
me
and
how
i
might
deal
with
a
felon
who
had
done
great
harm
to
many
gallant
knights
and
indeed
i
did
deal
with
him
so
that
he
shall
hurt
such
knights
no
more
i
pray
you
fair
lady
to
pardon
me
that
i
left
you
awhile
even
for
such
cause
and
to
take
me
once
more
as
your
faithful
servant
and
illustration
the
lady
una
and
the
lion
so
the
two
rode
on
together
they
had
not
travelled
many
miles
when
they
saw
coming
to
them
riding
at
the
full
speed
of
his
horse
a
knight
fully
armed
when
he
came
near
they
saw
that
he
was
a
man
of
very
fierce
aspect
and
that
he
carried
on
his
shield
the
name
fierce
as
he
was
of
look
he
grew
fiercer
yet
when
he
perceived
the
false
knight
s
shield
how
it
had
the
badge
of
the
red
cross
not
a
word
did
he
speak
but
he
laid
his
spear
in
rest
and
rode
fiercely
forward
sorely
dismayed
was
archimage
and
loath
to
meet
the
stranger
in
battle
for
indeed
he
was
not
used
to
bearing
arms
yet
could
he
not
hold
back
for
very
shame
the
lady
una
also
looked
at
him
that
he
should
bear
himself
bravely
but
it
fared
ill
with
him
and
indeed
it
would
have
fared
worse
but
that
his
steed
being
no
less
timorous
than
himself
held
back
in
the
onset
so
that
the
shock
of
their
meeting
was
the
less
fierce
nevertheless
he
was
thrown
to
the
ground
where
he
lay
helpless
and
without
defence
the
strange
knight
leapt
lightly
from
his
horse
and
made
as
though
he
would
have
slain
his
adversary
ha
he
cried
so
he
that
slew
the
brave
knight
sansfoy
my
brother
has
come
by
his
deserts
sansfoy
he
slew
and
by
sansloy
he
shall
be
slain
then
he
began
to
unlace
the
man
s
helmet
as
he
lay
upon
the
ground
but
the
lady
una
cried
oh
sir
knight
hold
your
hand
is
it
not
enough
that
you
have
vanquished
him
he
lies
there
at
your
mercy
therefore
have
mercy
upon
him
verily
there
is
not
in
the
whole
world
a
truer
knight
than
but
the
stranger
had
no
mind
to
hold
his
hand
for
indeed
he
had
no
compassion
within
his
heart
but
when
he
had
ended
the
unlacing
of
the
helmet
and
was
now
ready
to
strike
he
saw
the
hoary
head
and
wrinkled
face
of
archimage
and
cried
what
is
this
that
i
see
archimage
luckless
sire
by
what
have
you
come
across
me
in
this
fashion
is
the
fault
with
me
or
with
you
that
i
should
have
dealt
with
a
friend
as
though
he
were
an
enemy
so
he
spake
but
not
a
word
did
the
wizard
answer
he
lay
in
a
swoon
and
the
shadow
of
death
was
on
his
face
and
now
the
lady
una
had
come
and
was
looking
into
the
old
man
s
face
sore
dismayed
she
was
and
sore
vexed
for
he
whom
she
had
taken
for
her
champion
was
a
deceiver
nor
could
she
divine
how
she
might
escape
from
the
hand
of
this
paynim
knight
and
now
she
had
to
bear
yet
another
grief
for
when
sansloy
laid
a
rude
hand
upon
her
and
bade
her
descend
from
her
steed
and
caught
away
her
veil
that
he
might
look
upon
her
face
the
lion
not
enduring
to
see
his
mistress
so
handled
and
treated
sprang
at
the
knight
but
alas
what
was
he
to
withstand
a
knight
clad
in
armour
of
proof
with
spear
and
sword
soon
did
sansloy
thrust
him
through
with
the
iron
point
so
that
the
faithful
beast
fell
dead
upon
the
ground
and
the
lady
was
left
helpless
and
without
defence
chapter
iv
of
what
befell
at
the
house
of
pride
the
knight
rode
on
with
the
false
fidessa
not
knowing
that
she
was
indeed
the
witch
duessa
who
had
changed
the
unhappy
fradubio
into
a
tree
after
a
while
they
came
to
a
road
which
was
manifestly
much
frequented
of
men
and
following
this
beheld
before
them
a
very
stately
palace
come
said
duessa
let
us
seek
shelter
here
for
i
am
weary
with
my
journeying
and
the
day
is
far
it
was
indeed
a
very
noble
house
cunningly
built
of
bricks
laid
artfully
together
without
mortar
it
had
very
lofty
walls
but
they
were
as
slight
as
they
were
high
overlaid
with
shining
gold
with
many
towers
rising
from
them
and
goodly
galleries
disposed
among
them
and
spacious
windows
no
one
could
blame
the
skill
of
the
architect
that
had
planned
it
or
of
the
builders
that
had
raised
it
up
so
fair
it
was
to
look
upon
yet
it
was
passing
strange
that
it
had
been
built
in
a
place
so
ill
chosen
to
wit
upon
a
sandy
hill
so
that
the
foundations
were
ever
slipping
away
from
it
and
when
the
winds
blew
upon
it
it
was
shaken
most
perilously
and
the
lower
parts
for
all
that
they
were
painted
so
as
to
make
a
very
brave
show
were
ruinous
and
old
they
passed
by
the
porter
whose
name
was
malvenu
which
being
interpreted
is
ill
come
without
challenge
and
so
came
into
the
hall
this
was
right
richly
arrayed
with
arras
and
and
was
filled
from
end
to
end
with
a
great
crowd
of
people
of
all
sorts
and
degrees
waiting
all
of
them
for
a
sight
of
the
lady
of
the
house
these
also
they
passed
as
being
guests
to
whom
special
honour
was
due
and
so
were
brought
into
the
presence
of
the
lady
where
she
sat
with
as
fair
and
a
company
of
knights
and
dames
about
her
as
ever
was
seen
upon
the
earth
high
on
a
throne
splendid
in
royal
robes
and
ornaments
of
gold
and
jewels
costly
beyond
all
count
sat
the
lady
fair
she
was
so
fair
that
throne
and
robes
and
gold
and
gems
were
as
nothing
in
comparison
with
her
beauty
under
her
feet
was
a
great
dragon
and
in
her
hand
she
held
a
shining
mirror
of
brass
and
her
name
was
lucifera
she
was
indeed
the
queen
of
pride
and
all
her
brave
show
was
a
false
seeming
and
her
kingdom
a
kingdom
of
unrighteousness
the
knight
not
knowing
what
the
lady
truly
was
and
false
duessa
to
whom
all
these
things
were
well
pleasing
being
introduced
by
a
certain
usher
of
the
court
vanity
by
name
bowed
themselves
low
before
the
throne
and
the
knight
said
lady
we
are
come
to
see
your
royal
state
and
to
prove
the
report
of
your
great
majesty
which
has
gone
through
all
the
i
thank
you
said
the
lady
but
in
a
disdainful
way
for
she
did
not
so
much
as
cast
her
eyes
upon
them
nor
did
she
bid
them
rise
on
the
other
hand
the
knights
and
ladies
set
themselves
with
much
heartiness
to
entertain
the
the
knights
were
right
glad
to
welcome
among
them
a
companion
so
fair
and
so
stalwart
and
to
the
dames
the
false
duessa
was
well
known
nevertheless
the
knight
was
but
ill
pleased
that
the
lady
lucifera
should
show
such
scant
courtesy
to
a
stranger
she
is
overproud
he
thought
to
himself
and
there
is
too
much
of
vain
show
in
these
her
while
he
was
thus
thinking
the
lady
rose
suddenly
from
her
place
and
said
that
she
would
ride
abroad
and
bade
call
for
her
coach
a
stately
coach
it
was
like
to
that
which
as
it
was
said
of
old
queen
juno
rode
with
six
peacocks
spreading
out
great
starry
tails
for
horses
six
steeds
had
this
queen
also
but
they
were
but
ill
matched
and
on
each
of
them
did
ride
one
of
the
six
counsellors
who
advised
her
in
affairs
of
state
and
the
six
were
idleness
and
gluttony
and
lust
and
avarice
and
envy
and
anger
the
false
duessa
followed
close
after
the
lady
lucifera
for
she
was
of
a
kindred
spirit
but
the
knight
though
he
knew
not
all
the
truth
yet
held
aloof
from
the
rout
not
liking
their
company
when
they
had
tarried
awhile
in
the
fields
breathing
the
fresh
air
of
the
they
turned
back
to
the
palace
there
they
found
a
saracen
knight
newly
come
who
carried
on
his
shield
the
name
he
was
and
as
one
who
bore
a
grudge
against
his
fellows
but
when
he
saw
how
the
page
of
the
knight
carried
a
shield
on
which
was
written
the
name
of
then
was
he
filled
with
fury
and
sprang
upon
the
lad
and
wrenched
it
from
him
which
the
knight
perceiving
being
ill
content
so
to
lose
the
trophy
which
he
had
won
in
fair
fight
ran
at
the
saracen
and
recovered
that
which
was
his
own
already
had
they
drawn
their
swords
to
fight
out
their
quarrel
hand
to
hand
when
the
queen
lucifera
interposed
her
high
command
sirs
she
said
i
command
you
on
pain
of
my
high
displeasure
to
forbear
if
you
will
you
shall
prove
in
fair
fight
to
whom
this
shield
for
which
i
perceive
you
contend
in
right
belongs
meanwhile
i
bid
you
be
at
i
beg
your
pardon
noble
queen
said
the
saracen
for
that
i
have
thus
broken
the
peace
of
your
court
in
truth
i
could
not
refrain
myself
when
i
saw
this
false
knight
possessing
the
shield
of
the
brave
whom
he
slew
not
in
fair
fight
but
by
magic
arts
ay
and
not
possessing
it
only
but
that
he
might
do
it
dishonour
commanding
that
it
should
be
publicly
so
spake
sansjoy
but
the
knight
said
nothing
he
was
a
man
of
deeds
not
of
words
only
he
threw
his
gauntlet
on
the
ground
to
be
a
pledge
that
he
would
meet
his
adversary
in
the
field
then
for
evening
was
now
come
all
sat
down
to
the
banquet
right
royally
did
they
feast
for
gluttony
was
steward
that
night
and
ordered
their
meat
and
drink
and
when
they
had
feasted
to
the
full
they
betook
themselves
to
their
beds
and
sloth
was
their
chamberlain
but
before
she
slept
duessa
made
sansjoy
aware
that
she
was
no
friend
to
the
knight
chapter
v
how
the
knight
leaves
the
castle
of
pride
it
is
ever
the
way
with
noble
hearts
that
they
can
not
rest
till
they
have
fully
accomplished
that
which
they
purpose
to
do
so
all
night
long
the
knight
considered
with
himself
how
he
should
most
wisely
bear
himself
in
the
morrow
s
fight
and
so
considering
he
waited
till
the
morning
light
should
shine
upon
the
earth
so
soon
therefore
as
the
sun
appeared
in
the
sky
he
rose
from
his
bed
and
arrayed
himself
in
his
armour
making
ready
for
his
combat
with
the
saracen
this
done
he
descended
into
the
castle
hall
where
there
was
already
gathered
a
great
crowd
of
men
who
had
come
to
see
what
the
issue
of
the
day
should
be
there
were
musicians
making
melody
on
harps
and
viols
and
bards
who
were
ready
to
celebrate
in
song
the
strength
and
valour
of
him
who
should
win
the
victory
after
him
by
no
great
space
of
time
came
the
saracen
clad
in
chain
armour
fierce
was
his
look
as
though
he
would
strike
fear
into
his
adversary
but
the
knight
was
of
a
temper
which
no
looks
could
dismay
then
the
pages
brought
in
two
cups
of
wine
from
greece
and
mingled
therein
spices
from
farthest
india
for
such
was
the
custom
of
the
place
it
was
to
kindle
the
champions
courage
forsooth
but
neither
christian
nor
saracen
i
take
it
had
need
of
such
encouragement
and
as
they
drank
they
sware
a
solemn
oath
that
they
would
duly
observe
the
laws
of
honourable
war
this
done
the
queen
lucifera
came
with
a
great
train
of
knights
and
ladies
and
took
her
seat
upon
the
throne
which
had
been
set
for
her
with
a
great
canopy
over
it
before
her
was
an
open
space
railed
in
on
every
side
that
none
should
be
near
either
to
help
or
to
hinder
the
champions
over
against
the
queen
was
set
another
throne
of
less
account
and
dignity
on
this
was
set
false
duessa
and
on
a
tree
hard
by
was
hung
the
shield
of
sansfoy
and
a
laurel
crown
which
should
be
the
conqueror
s
meed
and
now
was
heard
the
shrill
note
of
a
trumpet
and
the
two
champions
addressed
themselves
to
the
battle
each
man
carried
his
shield
on
his
left
arm
and
took
his
sword
in
his
right
hand
for
such
was
the
order
of
the
fight
that
for
a
speedier
issue
they
should
lay
aside
their
spears
and
take
at
once
their
swords
both
knights
were
sturdy
and
brave
and
long
they
fought
without
advantage
gained
stroke
was
answered
with
stroke
while
the
sparks
flew
from
either
shield
and
each
helmet
showed
the
dints
where
the
steel
had
been
broken
through
neither
did
this
champion
or
that
escape
without
harm
for
the
blood
was
seen
to
flow
out
and
dye
their
coats
of
mail
but
neither
suffered
such
a
wound
as
to
hinder
him
from
the
fight
nor
did
the
crowd
that
watched
them
know
which
would
prevail
and
now
it
chanced
that
the
saracen
as
he
shifted
his
place
caught
the
sight
of
his
brother
s
shield
where
it
hung
upon
the
tree
to
be
the
conqueror
s
prize
the
sight
stirred
him
to
a
double
rage
ah
brother
he
cried
dost
thou
sit
so
long
by
that
dark
lake
of
death
the
while
thy
shield
hangs
here
to
be
the
prize
of
victory
go
caitiff
so
he
cried
as
he
turned
him
to
the
knight
go
and
tell
him
that
i
have
redeemed
his
shield
from
and
as
he
spoke
he
smote
upon
the
crest
of
the
knight
a
mightier
stroke
by
far
than
he
had
ever
dealt
twice
did
the
knight
reel
as
he
stood
twice
was
he
ready
to
fall
while
all
that
watched
were
assured
that
the
battle
was
indeed
won
and
lost
and
the
false
duessa
cried
aloud
well
done
sansjoy
the
shield
is
yours
and
i
and
but
when
the
knight
heard
the
voice
of
the
he
knew
not
yet
her
true
raised
himself
from
his
swoon
and
his
faith
that
had
waxed
weak
grew
strong
again
and
the
chill
departed
from
his
limbs
wrath
and
shame
and
love
wrought
such
new
strength
within
him
that
he
struck
his
foe
with
a
stroke
so
mighty
that
it
brought
him
to
his
knee
ah
thou
miscreant
he
cried
go
now
and
take
yourself
your
message
to
this
dear
brother
and
tell
him
that
the
conqueror
has
his
but
when
he
would
have
dealt
yet
another
blow
and
so
ended
the
fight
beyond
all
doubt
lo
there
was
a
dark
cloud
over
all
the
place
and
the
saracen
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
he
called
him
aloud
but
there
came
no
answer
the
darkness
had
swallowed
him
up
then
the
false
duessa
came
down
from
her
seat
and
entreated
him
with
many
words
o
most
valiant
knight
that
ever
lady
chose
for
her
champion
abate
now
your
rage
your
adversary
lies
low
be
content
with
your
but
not
one
whit
was
his
wrath
diminished
willingly
would
he
have
driven
his
deep
into
the
body
of
his
enemy
so
finishing
his
work
but
nowhere
could
he
espy
him
while
he
stood
wondering
the
trumpets
sounded
again
now
with
a
note
of
victory
and
heralds
came
and
paid
him
homage
making
low
obeisance
to
him
and
giving
into
his
hands
the
shield
after
this
they
took
him
to
the
queen
where
she
sat
upon
her
throne
and
he
bending
his
knee
before
her
made
proffer
of
his
service
which
she
accepted
with
much
courtesy
of
thanks
this
done
she
returned
to
the
palace
having
the
knight
by
her
side
the
people
following
with
loud
shouts
and
much
rejoicing
and
now
because
his
wounds
were
not
without
much
cost
of
pain
had
he
won
this
laid
him
in
a
bed
and
bound
up
his
hurts
pouring
in
oil
and
wine
the
while
the
musicians
made
sweet
music
to
comfort
him
in
his
sickness
while
he
thus
lay
duessa
resorted
to
a
certain
witch
of
whom
she
had
knowledge
and
told
her
of
how
the
christian
knight
had
slain
sansfoy
and
now
had
stricken
sansjoy
to
death
and
prayed
her
help
so
the
two
returned
together
to
where
the
saracen
lay
still
covered
with
the
magic
cloud
they
bound
up
his
wounds
and
laid
him
in
the
witch
s
car
and
carried
him
to
hell
to
the
dwelling
of
æsculapius
now
this
æsculapius
was
a
great
physician
in
the
days
of
old
and
because
he
had
brought
to
life
again
a
certain
man
who
had
been
unjustly
slain
he
had
suffered
grievous
punishment
he
could
not
die
for
he
was
of
immortal
race
but
he
had
been
struck
down
to
hell
with
a
thunderbolt
there
he
had
lain
age
after
age
striving
if
it
might
be
to
heal
his
own
hurts
to
him
therefore
the
witch
and
duessa
brought
sansjoy
and
prayed
him
that
he
would
recover
him
of
his
deadly
hurt
nay
nay
said
he
you
ask
what
may
not
be
you
tempt
me
to
do
again
the
very
thing
for
which
i
suffer
all
this
pain
shall
i
again
with
a
like
deed
renew
the
wrath
of
him
that
so
dealt
with
me
the
witch
made
answer
what
more
can
you
suffer
than
you
have
suffered
already
you
hope
for
nothing
what
then
should
you
fear
you
are
in
this
lowest
deep
is
there
a
lower
to
which
you
can
fall
deny
not
my
prayer
rather
show
the
power
which
has
given
you
your
great
renown
in
heaven
and
on
earth
and
in
hell
be
it
so
he
said
so
they
brought
the
knight
and
the
great
physician
used
all
his
arts
applying
to
the
man
s
wound
all
the
healing
powers
that
he
knew
then
duessa
having
accomplished
her
purpose
so
far
as
it
might
be
done
journeyed
back
to
the
palace
of
pride
but
when
she
came
thither
she
found
that
the
knight
had
departed
now
the
cause
of
his
going
was
this
he
was
not
indeed
fit
for
travel
nor
had
his
wounds
been
duly
healed
but
he
might
not
stay
having
heard
what
his
faithful
dwarf
had
told
him
and
the
thing
was
this
that
there
were
dungeons
beneath
this
fair
castle
with
all
its
splendid
furnishing
in
which
lay
a
crowd
of
prisoners
in
most
miserable
plight
men
of
the
old
times
and
of
the
new
such
as
were
nimrod
the
great
hunter
and
the
lords
of
babylon
and
nineveh
and
great
chiefs
of
rome
all
who
by
wicked
pride
had
sinned
against
god
and
man
this
had
the
watchful
dwarf
espied
and
when
the
knight
heard
the
tale
he
would
tarry
no
longer
but
that
very
hour
while
it
was
yet
dark
for
it
would
have
gone
ill
with
him
had
he
been
espied
he
fled
from
the
castle
by
a
he
fled
and
lo
it
was
so
full
of
the
corpses
of
men
that
he
and
the
dwarf
could
scarce
make
their
way
for
though
the
castle
was
fair
in
all
its
public
parts
those
that
were
secret
were
foul
beyond
all
thinking
chapter
vi
the
lady
una
and
the
satyrs
though
the
wizard
archimage
was
an
ill
companion
for
the
lady
una
yet
was
sansloy
by
whom
he
was
overthrown
a
worse
they
had
not
travelled
together
far
when
he
said
lady
deign
i
pray
you
to
show
me
that
fair
face
of
yours
i
would
fain
know
for
whom
i
have
done
battle
yours
i
ween
is
such
beauty
as
the
old
villain
whom
i
overthrew
was
not
worthy
to
take
in
and
when
she
answered
him
not
a
word
he
stretched
forth
a
lawless
hand
and
would
have
torn
the
veil
from
her
face
then
she
cried
aloud
ay
said
he
cry
if
you
will
there
is
none
to
help
you
but
even
while
he
spoke
there
came
running
out
of
the
wood
which
was
hard
by
a
great
multitude
of
strange
creatures
fauns
and
satyrs
half
man
and
half
beast
they
were
dancing
and
making
merry
in
the
forest
which
is
their
natural
and
when
they
heard
the
cry
one
said
to
another
this
is
the
cry
of
some
mortal
in
distress
and
it
has
the
note
of
a
woman
s
voice
let
us
see
what
is
the
so
they
made
all
haste
to
the
place
from
which
the
cry
came
and
when
the
saracen
beheld
them
he
was
sore
afraid
such
creatures
he
had
never
seen
in
all
his
life
so
he
sprang
upon
his
horse
and
fled
as
fast
as
he
could
nor
indeed
was
the
lady
una
wholly
quit
of
her
fears
so
it
may
chance
that
when
a
wolf
carries
off
a
lamb
and
drops
it
for
fear
of
a
lion
the
lamb
may
be
in
no
better
case
but
when
the
strange
creatures
saw
by
the
lady
s
face
that
she
was
sore
afraid
they
tried
to
show
their
goodwill
towards
her
they
threw
themselves
upon
the
ground
and
kissed
her
feet
and
sought
to
show
her
that
they
were
her
dutiful
servants
so
gathering
courage
she
raised
herself
from
the
earth
on
which
she
had
thrown
herself
in
fear
and
distress
and
made
signs
that
she
would
go
with
them
so
they
led
her
through
the
wood
dancing
and
shouting
and
singing
and
some
strewed
branches
of
trees
on
the
ground
before
her
and
one
who
was
a
chief
among
them
put
a
crown
of
olive
leaves
about
her
head
so
they
led
her
to
their
chief
sylvanus
and
he
waked
from
his
sleep
by
their
shouting
came
forth
to
meet
them
leaning
on
a
staff
of
cypress
wood
and
having
a
rope
of
ivy
knitted
about
his
middle
when
he
saw
her
much
did
he
marvel
who
she
could
be
this
is
not
venus
he
said
to
himself
for
venus
never
was
in
so
sober
a
mood
no
nor
diana
for
i
see
not
her
bow
and
arrows
and
the
buskins
up
to
her
and
while
he
stood
and
wondered
the
nymphs
flocked
in
to
see
nymphs
of
the
fountains
and
the
woods
and
they
whose
lives
are
bound
to
a
single
tree
living
while
it
lives
and
dying
when
it
dies
nor
were
they
less
astonished
but
they
were
ill
pleased
that
one
so
fair
should
come
among
them
who
of
the
wood
folk
they
said
to
themselves
will
think
of
us
when
this
mortal
maid
is
near
many
days
lady
una
tarried
with
this
strange
folk
and
not
unwillingly
for
it
was
as
it
were
a
breathing
time
giving
her
rest
from
the
long
toil
of
her
journey
and
while
she
tarried
she
strove
to
the
utmost
to
teach
them
something
of
the
christian
faith
but
ever
she
had
much
ado
to
keep
them
from
the
worshipping
of
herself
and
when
she
had
scarcely
kept
them
from
this
they
turned
to
worship
her
ass
after
a
while
there
came
into
these
parts
a
certain
knight
satyrane
by
name
so
called
because
he
was
the
son
of
a
prince
among
the
satyrs
but
his
mother
was
of
the
race
of
men
he
was
brought
up
in
the
woods
far
from
all
human
company
nor
did
he
learn
letters
or
any
craft
whatsoever
but
only
to
be
ever
of
a
good
courage
and
to
banish
fear
so
he
would
lay
his
hand
on
lions
and
bears
and
tame
the
wild
bulls
of
the
forest
riding
on
them
as
one
might
ride
upon
a
horse
and
he
grew
to
be
so
swift
of
foot
that
he
would
overtake
the
roebuck
in
his
flight
tis
said
that
once
when
his
mother
came
to
see
him
for
she
had
gone
back
to
dwell
with
her
own
kind
she
saw
him
carrying
in
his
arms
the
cubs
of
a
lioness
which
he
had
carried
away
from
their
dam
while
the
creature
in
its
rage
followed
him
roaring
aloud
yet
dared
not
spring
so
well
did
all
the
beasts
of
the
forest
know
and
fear
him
when
he
grew
to
years
of
manhood
he
was
not
content
with
the
conquest
over
wild
beasts
or
with
life
in
the
wood
far
from
man
he
went
therefore
into
distant
lands
seeking
adventures
in
which
he
acquitted
him
so
well
that
no
man
could
boast
of
having
overthrown
him
yet
it
was
his
custom
from
time
to
time
to
return
to
his
old
to
see
his
old
father
and
to
rest
awhile
from
his
labours
and
so
coming
now
he
chanced
to
find
the
lady
una
sitting
with
a
company
of
the
forest
folk
around
her
teaching
them
holy
things
much
he
marvelled
to
see
how
fair
she
was
and
more
did
he
marvel
at
the
wise
and
gracious
words
that
came
from
her
lips
for
indeed
by
this
time
being
by
nature
of
a
lively
wit
he
had
himself
learnt
many
things
so
he
gladly
sought
her
company
and
would
fain
be
her
disciple
and
learn
the
ways
of
righteousness
and
peace
from
her
lips
after
certain
days
the
lady
una
seeing
that
this
satyrane
was
an
honourable
knight
and
worthy
of
trust
said
to
him
i
would
fain
go
on
with
journeyings
if
haply
i
may
find
my
lady
he
made
answer
i
am
bound
to
do
your
pleasure
it
shall
be
as
you
so
having
watched
for
a
time
when
the
forest
folk
were
away
he
took
her
through
the
forest
till
they
came
to
the
plain
beyond
when
the
day
was
now
far
spent
they
spied
a
traveller
on
the
road
and
judging
from
his
look
and
garb
that
he
had
come
from
far
hastened
towards
him
hoping
that
they
might
by
chance
hear
something
that
would
help
them
in
their
quest
he
was
an
old
man
of
low
estate
as
it
seemed
his
garments
worn
and
soiled
with
much
dust
from
the
road
his
sandals
torn
with
much
travelling
and
his
face
bronzed
by
the
sun
as
if
he
had
travelled
long
in
arabian
or
indian
land
a
staff
he
carried
in
his
hand
and
on
his
shoulders
hung
a
wallet
in
which
he
carried
such
things
as
were
needed
for
his
journey
satyrane
said
to
him
friend
have
you
aught
to
tell
me
of
wars
and
adventures
in
these
or
in
foreign
parts
for
indeed
you
seem
to
have
come
a
long
way
nay
answered
the
stranger
i
am
a
simple
man
and
know
nothing
of
such
then
said
the
lady
una
tell
me
now
whether
you
have
seen
or
heard
aught
of
the
champion
whom
i
am
seeking
he
bears
a
red
cross
on
his
the
old
man
answered
fair
lady
truly
i
have
seen
such
an
one
with
these
eyes
and
a
sorry
sight
it
was
for
he
lay
dead
upon
the
when
the
lady
una
heard
these
words
she
fell
to
the
earth
in
a
swoon
when
satyrane
with
much
care
had
brought
her
back
to
life
she
said
friend
tell
me
all
that
you
know
one
who
has
borne
the
greater
pain
may
well
endure
the
the
old
traveller
answered
on
a
certain
evil
day
it
was
and
i
am
grieved
that
i
ever
lived
to
see
i
chanced
to
be
passing
on
my
way
i
saw
two
knights
contending
fiercely
together
one
was
a
saracen
and
the
other
bore
a
red
cross
on
his
shield
and
he
that
carried
this
device
was
oh
to
think
cried
the
lady
una
that
he
should
be
thus
overcome
he
that
was
so
stout
and
brave
how
could
such
an
evil
chance
befall
that
i
know
not
fair
lady
said
the
old
man
i
can
but
relate
the
thing
which
i
saw
with
mine
then
said
satyrane
tell
me
now
old
man
where
is
the
saracen
knight
that
did
this
deed
is
he
far
from
hence
or
near
at
hand
the
old
man
made
answer
you
may
find
him
not
far
from
here
i
left
him
but
a
short
time
ago
sitting
by
a
fountain
where
he
washed
his
the
knight
satyrane
having
further
inquired
by
what
way
he
should
go
made
all
haste
to
find
the
saracen
fearing
lest
haply
he
should
have
departed
and
indeed
he
found
him
sitting
by
the
fountain
side
under
the
shade
of
a
tree
for
it
was
sansloy
the
same
that
had
overthrown
archimage
and
satyrane
cried
aloud
rise
from
your
place
accursed
miscreant
you
that
by
some
unknightly
craft
and
treachery
have
slain
the
knight
for
i
know
well
that
you
could
not
have
overcome
him
in
fair
fight
rise
up
and
either
maintain
your
cause
in
arms
or
confess
your
the
saracen
when
he
heard
these
words
rose
quickly
from
his
place
and
put
his
helmet
on
his
head
and
took
his
shield
upon
his
arm
and
drew
near
to
his
adversary
but
first
he
said
truly
you
have
been
sent
hither
in
an
evil
hour
to
fight
a
quarrel
that
is
not
yours
and
indeed
you
blame
me
for
a
deed
which
i
have
not
done
the
knight
i
slew
not
nor
indeed
did
i
engage
in
fight
with
him
someone
who
falsely
bore
his
arms
i
overthrew
but
come
now
if
you
may
not
fight
in
his
quarrel
fight
in
your
then
the
two
men
came
together
in
fierce
encounter
when
they
were
at
the
hottest
of
the
fray
the
lady
una
came
to
the
place
for
satyrane
had
left
her
behind
in
his
haste
and
when
she
saw
the
saracen
she
said
to
herself
now
what
shall
i
do
if
this
false
villain
should
get
the
upper
hand
of
satyrane
and
the
thought
struck
such
terror
into
her
heart
that
she
straightway
turned
and
fled
from
the
place
and
the
old
traveller
who
had
told
the
false
tale
of
the
slaying
of
the
knight
followed
her
for
indeed
he
was
none
other
than
archimage
chapter
vii
of
the
giant
orgoglio
when
the
false
duessa
came
back
to
the
palace
of
pride
from
the
journey
which
she
had
made
in
the
matter
of
sansjoy
she
found
that
the
knight
had
departed
thereupon
she
set
out
without
delay
being
altogether
unwilling
that
he
should
escape
out
of
reach
of
her
nets
nor
indeed
was
it
long
before
she
found
him
sitting
by
the
side
of
a
spring
in
the
shade
of
a
tree
he
had
put
off
his
armour
by
reason
of
his
weariness
and
of
the
heat
of
the
day
you
did
ill
to
leave
me
in
that
ill
place
sir
knight
she
said
for
ill
i
found
it
to
be
even
as
you
did
then
he
excused
himself
with
courteous
words
and
so
peace
was
made
again
between
the
two
now
the
spring
by
which
the
knight
was
taking
his
rest
was
not
as
other
springs
but
there
lay
a
curse
upon
it
because
the
nymph
which
dwelt
therein
had
fallen
out
of
favour
with
her
mistress
diana
and
the
cause
of
her
so
falling
was
this
on
a
certain
day
as
diana
and
her
train
were
following
the
chase
the
nymph
of
this
spring
being
wearied
with
the
heat
and
toil
of
the
day
sat
herself
down
to
rest
with
this
her
mistress
being
very
keen
in
her
hunting
was
ill
pleased
maid
she
cried
you
are
dull
and
slow
such
then
shall
these
waters
be
for
ever
ay
and
whosoever
shall
drink
of
of
this
the
knight
knew
nothing
but
because
the
waters
were
crystal
clear
and
cold
and
his
thirst
was
great
he
drank
a
great
draught
and
as
he
drank
the
powers
of
body
and
soul
grew
faint
and
feeble
but
by
slow
degrees
and
unperceived
ere
long
there
came
to
his
ears
a
loud
bellowing
sound
which
made
the
trees
to
tremble
and
the
very
earth
to
shake
the
knight
leapt
from
the
ground
and
would
have
armed
himself
but
yet
such
was
the
working
of
that
magic
spring
was
strangely
slow
certain
it
is
that
ere
he
could
don
his
armour
or
thrust
his
arm
into
the
fitting
of
his
shield
there
came
stalking
along
with
mighty
stride
the
most
fearsome
giant
that
ever
was
seen
on
the
face
of
the
earth
his
stature
was
thrice
that
of
man
and
in
his
right
hand
he
carried
an
oak
tree
which
he
had
torn
from
the
earth
by
its
roots
it
served
him
for
a
staff
whereon
to
stay
his
steps
and
for
a
mace
with
which
to
slay
his
foes
so
soon
as
he
spied
the
knight
he
came
against
him
with
the
oak
tree
lifted
in
his
hand
on
the
other
hand
the
knight
made
a
vain
show
of
battle
but
the
strength
had
departed
from
his
arm
and
the
heart
in
him
failed
for
fear
he
lifted
his
sword
indeed
but
he
had
no
power
to
strike
then
the
giant
aimed
at
him
a
mighty
blow
such
as
would
have
levelled
to
the
ground
a
tower
of
stone
verily
but
for
the
grace
and
help
of
god
it
had
ground
him
to
powder
but
he
leapt
from
under
it
yet
its
very
wind
laid
him
prostrate
on
the
ground
when
the
giant
saw
him
lie
helpless
in
this
fashion
he
lifted
his
hand
again
as
if
to
slay
him
but
the
false
duessa
who
for
her
own
ends
would
not
have
the
knight
perish
in
this
fashion
cried
aloud
o
orgoglio
greatest
of
all
creatures
under
the
sun
slay
him
not
but
make
him
your
thrall
and
the
giant
listened
to
this
prayer
he
took
the
knight
in
his
arms
and
carried
him
to
his
castle
and
there
threw
him
into
a
dungeon
that
had
been
dug
deep
into
the
earth
there
he
lay
for
a
while
with
such
scant
provision
of
meat
and
drink
as
sufficed
to
keep
the
life
in
him
the
faithful
dwarf
had
seen
his
master
fall
for
he
had
the
knight
s
in
charge
while
the
beast
was
grazing
in
the
meadow
hard
by
and
now
the
giant
having
departed
with
his
prisoner
he
gathered
together
the
arms
and
the
armour
for
these
orgoglio
had
left
lying
on
the
ground
as
taking
no
account
of
such
things
there
was
the
helmet
and
the
cuirass
and
the
greaves
and
the
shield
with
the
cross
upon
it
and
the
sad
to
behold
now
that
there
was
none
to
wear
or
wield
them
he
laid
them
on
the
back
of
the
and
so
departed
he
had
not
gone
far
before
he
met
the
lady
una
herself
when
she
saw
him
and
the
and
the
burden
which
it
bore
there
was
no
spirit
left
in
her
so
that
she
fell
without
sense
to
the
ground
willingly
would
the
faithful
dwarf
have
died
knowing
what
ill
tidings
he
bore
and
seeing
how
ill
they
were
taken
nevertheless
he
did
not
lose
heart
but
with
much
pain
and
care
sought
to
recover
the
lady
from
her
swoon
thrice
did
he
bring
her
back
to
life
and
thrice
she
fell
as
one
dead
to
the
ground
at
last
when
the
spirit
within
her
had
somewhat
recovered
itself
she
said
with
faltering
tongue
tell
me
now
faithful
friend
the
whole
story
from
the
beginning
how
it
is
that
i
see
these
relics
of
the
bravest
knight
that
ever
was
verily
fortune
has
spent
all
her
spite
upon
him
and
me
worse
than
that
which
i
feel
in
my
heart
i
can
not
hear
begin
your
tale
and
carry
it
to
the
very
end
if
haply
it
shall
be
in
aught
less
dreadful
than
what
i
fear
so
much
i
shall
have
then
the
dwarf
rehearsed
from
the
beginning
all
that
had
befallen
the
knight
from
the
time
of
their
parting
the
deceits
of
archimage
and
the
wiles
of
the
false
duessa
and
the
fate
of
the
two
lovers
who
had
been
changed
to
trees
and
the
palace
of
pride
and
the
combat
with
sansjoy
and
how
the
knight
had
been
taken
unprepared
by
the
giant
orgoglio
to
these
things
the
lady
listened
with
attentive
ear
and
when
the
dwarf
had
ended
his
tale
she
said
verily
i
will
seek
him
as
long
as
i
live
lead
on
and
show
me
the
way
that
i
must
so
they
travelled
both
together
they
had
not
journeyed
far
before
they
met
a
knight
riding
on
the
way
with
his
squire
behind
him
never
was
there
more
gallant
warrior
or
more
gallantly
arrayed
his
armour
shone
like
the
sun
and
across
his
breast
he
wore
a
baldrick
richly
adorned
with
precious
stones
costly
were
they
all
but
one
among
them
shone
most
excellently
a
great
diamond
like
to
the
head
of
a
fair
lady
brighter
than
all
the
rest
even
as
the
star
of
evening
is
brighter
than
all
the
hosts
of
heaven
his
sword
hung
from
his
side
in
a
sheath
cunningly
made
of
ivory
its
hilt
was
of
burnished
gold
and
its
buckle
also
of
gold
the
crest
of
his
helmet
was
a
great
dragon
with
wings
spread
out
on
either
side
and
above
the
crest
a
plume
which
waved
to
and
fro
as
an
almond
tree
waves
its
blossoms
in
the
breath
of
spring
but
the
great
marvel
of
his
equipment
was
his
shield
it
was
not
made
of
iron
or
of
brass
as
are
the
shields
of
common
men
but
of
one
great
diamond
only
it
was
covered
up
from
sight
when
he
would
dismay
some
huge
monster
or
strike
with
fear
some
great
array
of
the
enemy
then
he
would
show
its
brightness
no
power
of
man
no
enchantments
strong
and
subtle
as
they
might
be
could
prevail
against
it
or
diminish
aught
of
its
power
for
indeed
it
was
made
by
the
greatest
magician
that
ever
lived
upon
the
earth
even
merlin
the
gallant
knight
spake
full
courteously
to
the
lady
una
asking
if
he
could
help
her
or
serve
her
in
aught
oh
sir
she
answered
my
sorrow
is
so
great
that
it
is
past
all
remedy
what
would
it
profit
to
tell
the
tale
tis
best
to
hide
it
in
my
heart
nor
stir
the
hidden
nay
lady
answered
the
knight
i
doubt
not
that
your
grief
is
great
but
i
would
counsel
you
to
tell
the
tale
for
all
it
is
so
sad
pain
is
ever
lessened
be
it
ever
so
great
by
wise
counsel
and
he
who
will
not
reveal
his
trouble
may
never
find
so
they
spake
together
he
persuading
her
to
reveal
her
sorrow
and
she
unwilling
to
bring
it
to
the
light
till
at
last
yielding
to
his
words
of
wisdom
she
told
her
tale
i
am
the
daughter
she
said
the
only
child
of
a
king
and
queen
whose
kingdom
lies
far
by
the
river
euphrates
long
did
they
reign
in
great
prosperity
till
a
great
dragon
bred
in
the
lakes
of
tartary
wasted
their
land
till
there
was
nothing
left
of
all
that
belonged
to
them
save
the
one
castle
in
which
they
dwelt
and
to
this
the
dragon
has
laid
siege
now
for
the
space
of
four
years
many
knights
have
taken
in
hand
this
enterprise
to
subdue
the
dragon
and
to
deliver
those
whom
he
oppresses
from
every
country
under
heaven
have
they
come
brave
men
and
famous
for
great
deeds
but
they
have
failed
one
and
all
for
want
of
faith
or
for
the
hidden
weakness
of
some
secret
sin
they
have
fallen
before
him
at
last
there
came
to
our
land
a
report
of
certain
famous
knights
that
had
been
bred
in
this
realm
of
fairy
land
thereupon
i
betook
myself
thither
even
to
the
court
of
queen
gloriana
who
dwells
in
the
city
of
renown
hoping
that
i
might
there
find
some
faithful
knight
who
should
deliver
my
father
and
mother
from
the
power
of
the
tyrant
nor
did
i
go
in
vain
it
was
my
good
fortune
to
find
a
gallant
knight
who
was
fit
and
willing
to
undertake
this
task
unproved
indeed
he
was
but
he
was
of
a
fair
body
and
a
noble
soul
it
was
he
who
set
forth
upon
this
enterprise
of
his
prowess
i
saw
full
many
a
proof
yea
the
sword
and
the
spear
which
you
see
on
the
back
of
yonder
steed
might
tell
if
they
could
speak
of
the
great
deeds
which
he
has
wrought
but
by
ill
chance
he
encountered
a
most
false
magician
by
whose
arts
he
was
betrayed
first
this
vile
creature
made
division
between
my
knight
and
me
so
that
he
misdoubted
of
my
faith
next
he
delivered
him
to
the
wiles
of
a
certain
false
woman
duessa
by
name
and
she
has
betrayed
him
into
the
hands
of
a
great
and
terrible
giant
orgoglio
by
name
and
in
this
giant
s
dungeon
he
now
lies
pining
to
death
this
is
my
grief
sir
knight
and
greater
surely
never
woman
your
grief
is
indeed
great
answered
the
stranger
knight
but
be
of
good
cheer
i
will
never
leave
you
till
i
have
set
your
champion
free
come
now
let
us
bring
this
matter
to
an
so
they
rode
on
together
with
the
dwarf
for
their
guide
the
name
of
the
gallant
knight
who
bore
the
shield
of
diamond
was
arthur
chapter
viii
of
the
deeds
of
prince
arthur
when
they
had
travelled
a
score
of
miles
or
so
they
came
to
a
castle
which
was
built
very
high
and
strong
thereupon
the
dwarf
cried
out
this
is
the
place
in
which
my
good
lord
lies
a
prisoner
the
thrall
of
the
giant
thereupon
the
prince
arthur
alighted
from
his
steed
and
said
to
the
lady
una
stay
here
madam
and
await
the
issue
of
this
day
s
then
at
his
bidding
the
squire
came
near
to
the
wall
of
the
castle
he
found
the
gates
fast
shut
with
no
warder
to
guard
them
nor
was
there
any
to
answer
when
he
called
then
the
squire
took
in
his
hand
a
bugle
that
he
bore
that
hung
by
his
side
with
a
chain
of
gold
decked
with
gay
tassels
it
was
a
bugle
of
wondrous
power
for
three
miles
it
could
be
heard
and
there
came
out
of
space
three
answers
to
its
blast
nor
could
anyone
in
whose
heart
there
was
aught
of
falsehood
endure
to
hear
it
without
dismay
nor
could
any
bolt
or
bar
however
stout
they
might
be
withstand
its
summons
this
bugle
then
prince
arthur
s
squire
sounded
before
the
giant
s
castle
and
it
was
shaken
straightway
from
the
foundation
to
the
topmost
towers
and
the
doors
flew
open
of
their
own
accord
the
giant
himself
was
much
troubled
at
the
sound
and
came
with
staggering
steps
as
one
smitten
with
a
sudden
fear
to
see
what
it
might
mean
and
after
came
the
false
duessa
riding
on
a
beast
with
fiery
tongues
for
such
a
monster
the
giant
had
given
her
for
her
own
prince
arthur
without
delay
addressed
himself
to
the
fight
nor
did
the
giant
draw
back
being
persuaded
that
no
mortal
man
could
stand
up
against
him
and
prevail
he
thought
indeed
to
slay
him
with
a
single
blow
and
lifted
up
his
mighty
club
but
the
prince
was
wise
and
wary
and
lightly
leaping
aside
he
escaped
the
stroke
unhurt
for
he
thought
it
no
shame
to
use
his
craft
against
brute
strength
as
for
the
club
so
missing
its
aim
it
sank
deep
into
the
earth
making
a
furrow
a
yard
deep
and
more
the
giant
pulled
at
it
amain
seeking
to
lift
it
for
another
stroke
but
could
not
prevail
so
fast
was
it
buried
the
knight
therefore
had
him
at
a
disadvantage
and
smote
him
with
his
sword
so
deadly
a
stroke
that
it
shore
off
his
arm
loud
did
he
bellow
with
fear
and
pain
and
duessa
seeing
her
champion
in
sore
distress
made
the
great
beast
on
which
she
sat
advance
against
the
knight
but
now
prince
arthur
s
squire
a
gallant
warrior
worthy
of
such
a
lord
stood
forth
and
with
his
single
sword
barred
the
way
in
high
disdain
to
be
hindered
by
so
weak
a
foe
duessa
yet
again
urged
on
the
beast
but
still
the
squire
stood
firm
he
would
not
give
place
a
single
step
lest
the
enemy
should
so
gain
an
advantage
against
his
lord
then
duessa
had
recourse
to
her
magic
arts
for
she
took
of
the
magic
juices
which
she
ever
carried
with
her
and
sprinkled
them
upon
the
youth
and
quenched
his
courage
and
robbed
him
of
his
strength
so
that
he
could
neither
see
nor
stand
so
he
fell
all
his
length
upon
the
earth
and
the
beast
laid
his
deadly
claws
upon
his
neck
and
would
have
crushed
the
life
out
of
him
but
the
knight
perceiving
his
evil
plight
turned
quickly
from
his
own
adversary
and
addressed
himself
to
the
beast
for
indeed
it
grieved
him
much
that
his
faithful
squire
should
have
come
into
such
peril
of
his
life
so
lifting
high
the
sword
with
which
he
had
smitten
the
giant
he
smote
the
beast
upon
one
of
its
heads
making
the
blood
pour
out
amain
but
when
the
beast
writhing
to
and
fro
in
its
pain
would
have
shaken
duessa
from
her
seat
upon
its
back
and
she
cried
out
in
her
fear
the
giant
came
to
her
help
he
was
indeed
of
no
common
nature
nor
was
he
disabled
by
the
wound
which
would
have
bereft
all
other
creatures
of
strength
in
the
one
hand
which
was
left
to
him
there
dwelt
the
strength
of
the
two
and
now
being
free
to
use
again
his
club
of
oak
he
lifted
it
up
high
and
dealt
such
a
blow
at
prince
arthur
s
shield
that
it
brought
him
to
the
ground
but
now
by
this
very
stroke
the
knight
s
deliverance
was
wrought
for
the
covering
was
torn
from
the
shield
by
its
violence
and
all
its
brightness
was
revealed
with
so
great
a
splendour
did
it
blaze
into
the
giant
s
eyes
that
he
dropped
his
arm
and
let
fall
the
club
with
which
he
was
ready
to
slay
his
adversary
the
beast
also
was
blinded
by
that
brightness
and
fell
reft
of
its
senses
on
the
ground
nor
when
duessa
cried
aloud
to
the
giant
in
her
fear
could
he
render
effectual
help
with
stroke
after
stroke
the
prince
lopped
from
him
limb
after
limb
till
he
lay
dead
upon
the
ground
and
then
this
marvel
came
to
pass
this
creature
which
had
seemed
so
vast
seemed
to
vanish
away
as
for
duessa
she
sprang
from
off
the
beast
and
would
have
fled
away
upon
her
feet
but
this
the
squire
would
not
suffer
for
pursuing
her
with
speedy
feet
he
laid
hold
of
her
and
brought
her
back
to
the
prince
to
await
his
judgment
and
now
the
lady
una
who
in
fear
and
trembling
had
watched
the
combat
from
a
distance
came
near
and
thanked
both
knight
and
squire
for
the
good
service
which
they
had
rendered
i
can
not
repay
you
she
said
may
heaven
give
you
your
reward
and
with
usury
suffer
me
to
say
one
thing
let
not
this
false
woman
depart
for
indeed
she
is
the
cause
of
all
the
mischief
that
has
been
then
prince
arthur
said
to
his
squire
take
this
woman
in
charge
i
will
go
seek
the
so
he
departed
on
this
errand
and
entering
the
castle
sought
someone
of
whom
he
might
inquire
no
one
did
he
find
and
though
he
called
aloud
there
was
none
to
answer
at
last
there
came
forth
an
old
man
leaning
on
a
staff
with
which
he
guided
his
steps
for
the
sight
of
his
eyes
had
failed
him
long
since
and
carrying
a
great
bunch
of
keys
but
all
of
them
overgrown
with
rust
his
name
was
ignaro
a
reverend
sire
he
seemed
and
the
knight
asked
him
with
all
courtesy
who
are
they
that
dwell
in
this
place
and
where
may
they
be
found
i
can
not
tell
he
said
then
the
prince
asked
again
where
then
is
the
knight
whom
the
giant
orgoglio
holds
in
thrall
i
can
not
tell
said
he
again
nor
did
he
say
any
other
words
the
prince
s
anger
rose
at
this
foolishness
but
he
checked
it
as
should
a
courteous
knight
and
taking
the
keys
from
the
old
man
s
hand
essayed
to
open
the
doors
nor
did
they
delay
to
yield
great
riches
he
found
of
gold
and
tapestry
finely
wrought
and
much
splendid
furnishing
but
the
floor
was
foul
with
blood
vainly
did
he
search
through
all
the
chambers
the
prisoner
he
could
not
find
at
last
he
came
to
an
iron
door
it
was
fast
locked
nor
was
there
a
key
upon
the
bunch
that
would
open
it
but
in
the
door
there
was
a
grating
of
iron
bars
through
this
he
called
aloud
dwells
there
anyone
in
this
place
for
i
will
set
him
free
to
this
there
came
a
low
voice
making
this
reply
who
is
that
who
comes
three
months
have
i
lain
in
this
foul
dungeon
and
if
you
bring
me
death
itself
i
would
choose
it
rather
than
to
stay
in
this
when
the
prince
heard
these
words
he
was
overcome
with
horror
and
pity
not
the
less
gathering
up
all
his
strength
he
smote
the
door
and
brake
it
from
its
hinges
but
when
the
opening
was
made
lo
on
the
other
side
was
no
floor
but
only
a
deep
pit
dark
as
night
from
which
there
came
up
a
loathsome
smell
but
neither
the
pit
nor
the
darkness
nor
the
vile
stench
abated
the
prince
s
courage
with
much
pains
and
toil
he
drew
up
the
prisoner
from
the
pit
sadly
wasted
was
he
he
could
not
stand
upon
his
feet
and
his
eyes
deep
sunk
in
the
sockets
could
not
bear
to
look
upon
the
light
and
his
arms
that
had
been
so
staunch
and
strong
in
the
old
time
were
wasted
to
the
bone
so
the
prince
carried
him
to
the
castle
door
and
when
the
lady
una
saw
him
she
was
filled
with
pity
and
ruth
and
would
have
comforted
him
welcome
my
lord
she
cried
whom
i
have
so
long
desired
to
see
soon
shall
you
have
a
recompense
for
all
that
you
have
dear
lady
he
made
answer
we
will
not
speak
of
the
evil
that
is
past
only
let
us
beware
that
we
fall
not
into
it
again
for
indeed
there
is
engraven
in
my
heart
as
with
a
pen
of
iron
this
true
saying
happiness
may
not
abide
in
the
heart
of
mortal
as
for
the
false
duessa
they
were
content
to
strip
her
of
her
robes
and
ornaments
and
fouler
creature
to
behold
there
never
was
then
the
knights
and
the
squire
and
the
lady
una
tarried
awhile
in
the
castle
where
they
found
all
things
that
they
needed
so
they
took
for
sundry
days
a
rest
from
their
toil
chapter
ix
of
the
house
of
holiness
the
time
was
now
come
when
having
rested
sufficiently
the
knight
must
set
forth
again
and
prince
arthur
being
bound
for
another
land
must
bid
his
companions
farewell
then
said
the
lady
una
tell
us
now
your
name
and
nation
for
it
would
be
a
great
loss
not
to
know
to
whom
we
owe
so
great
a
fair
lady
said
he
you
ask
me
that
which
it
passeth
my
wit
to
answer
this
only
do
i
know
that
so
soon
as
i
was
born
i
was
taken
by
a
knight
of
fairyland
to
timon
now
the
wisest
as
he
was
once
the
most
expert
in
arms
among
living
men
by
him
to
be
brought
up
in
all
virtuous
lore
and
noble
accomplishment
to
his
house
the
great
merlin
would
often
come
for
he
had
the
chief
charge
of
my
upbringing
and
he
when
i
asked
him
of
my
family
answered
be
content
you
are
the
son
and
heir
of
a
king
as
shall
be
made
manifest
in
due
and
how
said
the
lady
una
came
you
here
seeking
adventure
you
bid
me
renew
an
unspeakable
grief
he
answered
there
was
a
time
when
i
laughed
at
the
name
of
love
and
thought
scorn
of
all
that
suffered
from
its
power
but
there
came
a
time
when
i
myself
confessed
it
on
a
certain
day
being
wearied
out
with
sport
i
laid
me
down
to
sleep
and
in
my
sleep
i
dreamt
a
dream
the
queen
of
fairyland
stood
by
my
side
and
told
me
that
she
loved
me
and
would
show
her
love
when
the
time
should
come
such
was
my
dream
whether
it
was
false
or
true
i
know
that
never
in
this
world
did
man
see
so
fair
a
sight
or
hear
words
so
sweet
and
when
i
woke
i
vowed
in
my
heart
that
i
would
seek
her
and
never
rest
till
i
had
found
her
nine
months
have
i
sought
her
but
in
the
lady
una
said
happy
queen
of
fairies
that
has
found
so
gallant
a
champion
and
the
knight
said
o
sir
to
whom
i
owe
my
life
if
ever
man
was
worthy
of
such
love
you
are
surely
he
and
now
the
time
was
come
when
they
must
part
prince
arthur
gave
to
the
knight
a
box
of
diamonds
set
in
gold
wherein
were
drops
of
a
wondrous
liquid
of
a
virtue
so
excellent
that
it
could
heal
the
most
grievous
wounds
and
the
knight
gave
to
the
prince
a
book
in
which
the
gospels
were
written
in
golden
letters
they
had
not
journeyed
far
when
they
were
aware
of
a
knight
in
complete
armour
riding
towards
them
as
fast
as
his
horse
could
gallop
he
seemed
to
be
flying
from
an
enemy
or
from
some
dreadful
thing
for
ever
and
anon
he
cast
a
look
behind
him
as
though
an
enemy
were
close
at
his
heels
when
he
came
near
they
saw
that
his
head
was
uncovered
and
that
his
hair
bristled
with
fear
while
his
face
was
as
pale
as
death
and
that
round
his
neck
was
a
rope
of
hemp
which
indeed
ill
agreed
with
his
shining
armour
but
he
made
no
account
so
overcome
with
fear
was
he
either
of
rope
or
of
arms
the
knight
rode
as
fast
as
he
could
so
as
to
meet
him
as
he
fled
and
said
to
him
tell
me
sir
knight
what
has
befallen
you
from
whom
do
you
flee
never
have
i
seen
knight
in
such
evil
not
a
word
did
the
stranger
speak
but
stood
staring
widely
out
of
stony
eyes
but
after
a
while
he
gathered
strength
to
speak
but
full
low
and
with
faltering
words
for
the
love
of
god
he
said
gentle
knight
hinder
me
not
he
comes
see
he
comes
after
me
as
fast
as
he
can
but
the
knight
held
him
fast
and
using
now
comfort
and
now
reproach
at
last
put
some
little
heart
into
him
so
that
he
could
tell
his
tale
and
the
tale
was
i
chanced
of
late
to
be
in
company
with
a
gentle
knight
sir
terwin
by
name
he
was
a
man
of
good
repute
for
courage
and
skill
in
arms
but
he
fared
ill
in
one
matter
in
that
he
loved
a
fair
lady
who
had
but
little
love
for
him
but
rather
took
pleasure
in
seeing
him
languish
and
lament
on
a
certain
day
as
we
were
coming
away
from
the
lady
s
he
had
been
paying
her
court
and
had
been
most
disdainfully
met
a
stranger
who
greeted
us
courteously
and
as
we
fared
on
together
told
us
many
wonderful
tales
of
great
adventures
when
he
had
in
this
way
won
our
regard
he
inquired
with
a
show
of
friendship
of
our
condition
and
when
he
had
heard
the
same
and
knew
that
we
suffered
not
a
little
distress
in
this
matter
of
love
for
i
too
was
not
less
troubled
in
this
respect
than
was
my
friend
he
began
to
talk
to
us
in
the
most
gloomy
fashion
taking
from
us
all
hope
of
relief
and
in
the
end
counselling
us
to
end
our
troubles
with
death
and
that
we
might
do
this
the
more
easily
he
gave
to
me
this
rope
and
to
sir
terwin
a
rusty
knife
with
this
said
knife
sir
terwin
unhappy
man
that
he
was
forthwith
slew
himself
but
i
whether
i
was
more
faint
of
heart
or
more
fortunate
i
know
not
fled
away
with
all
i
would
see
this
fellow
said
the
knight
and
deal
with
him
according
to
his
nay
said
the
other
whose
name
was
trevisan
i
counsel
you
not
to
go
within
hearing
of
his
speech
so
powerful
is
he
to
and
when
the
knight
was
urgent
to
go
sir
trevisan
answered
to
do
your
pleasure
friend
i
will
show
the
place
but
i
myself
would
sooner
die
than
so
they
two
rode
together
and
the
lady
una
with
them
till
they
came
to
the
place
it
was
a
gloomy
cave
in
the
side
of
a
rock
on
the
top
of
which
there
sat
an
owl
making
a
doleful
screech
by
the
side
of
the
cave
were
stocks
of
trees
without
leaf
or
fruit
but
with
the
carcases
of
men
hanging
upon
them
and
on
the
ground
beneath
were
other
bodies
which
had
fallen
down
by
lapse
of
years
sir
trevisan
would
have
fled
when
he
saw
the
place
but
the
other
would
not
suffer
it
they
entered
the
cave
and
saw
the
man
sitting
on
the
ground
within
his
grisly
hair
fell
in
long
locks
about
his
neck
and
his
eyes
were
deadly
dull
and
his
cheeks
sunken
as
if
it
were
with
hunger
and
grief
his
garments
were
dirty
and
patched
being
fastened
together
with
thorns
and
on
the
ground
beside
him
there
lay
the
corpse
of
a
man
newly
slain
whose
blood
had
not
yet
ceased
to
flow
from
the
wound
then
said
the
knight
what
say
you
wicked
man
why
you
should
not
be
straightway
judged
for
the
evil
deed
which
you
have
done
what
words
are
these
stranger
said
the
man
and
what
judgment
is
this
why
should
he
live
who
desires
to
die
is
it
against
justice
that
a
man
should
have
his
due
or
again
to
speak
of
charity
rather
than
justice
is
it
not
well
to
help
him
over
that
comes
to
a
great
flood
or
to
free
the
feet
that
stick
fast
in
the
mire
he
that
lies
there
enjoys
the
rest
which
you
desire
and
can
not
have
somewhat
painful
the
passage
it
can
not
be
denied
yet
how
great
and
how
sweet
the
rest
is
it
not
well
to
endure
short
pain
for
so
long
a
happiness
sleep
after
toil
port
after
stormy
seas
ease
after
war
death
after
life
what
better
can
you
ask
nay
answered
the
knight
the
time
of
a
man
s
life
is
ordered
no
one
may
shorten
it
at
his
will
no
nor
any
soldier
quit
the
post
at
which
he
has
been
say
you
so
replied
the
other
if
all
things
have
their
appointed
end
who
shall
deny
that
the
end
which
you
shall
yourself
set
is
of
the
things
appointed
by
fate
remember
also
this
the
longer
the
life
the
more
the
sin
and
the
more
the
sin
the
greater
the
punishment
once
you
have
missed
the
right
who
has
not
missed
it
further
you
stray
and
have
you
not
strayed
sir
knight
bethink
you
what
you
have
endured
and
what
you
have
done
amiss
what
of
the
lady
whom
you
swore
to
champion
and
so
shamefully
deserted
what
of
the
false
duessa
to
whom
you
so
basely
pledged
yourself
does
not
the
law
say
he
that
sins
shall
die
die
therefore
as
becomes
a
brave
man
without
delay
and
of
your
own
the
knight
was
greatly
troubled
by
these
words
for
indeed
there
were
many
things
of
which
his
conscience
accused
him
so
that
he
trembled
and
grew
faint
which
when
the
fiend
perceived
he
showed
him
a
picture
in
which
was
set
forth
the
sufferings
of
lost
souls
and
after
this
perceiving
him
to
be
yet
more
confounded
he
brought
to
him
a
sword
and
poison
and
a
rope
bidding
him
choose
the
death
by
which
he
would
rather
die
and
when
the
knight
took
none
of
these
he
put
into
his
hand
a
sharp
knife
once
and
again
did
the
knight
lift
it
up
as
if
to
strike
but
when
the
lady
una
saw
it
she
snatched
the
knife
out
of
his
hand
crying
fie
fie
on
thee
faint
hearted
is
this
the
battle
which
you
promised
to
fight
against
the
dragon
of
the
fiery
mouth
come
away
let
not
these
idle
words
dismay
your
heart
you
are
chosen
to
a
great
work
why
should
you
despair
surely
mercy
rejoices
against
judgment
and
the
greater
the
need
the
greater
the
grace
come
let
us
leave
this
accursed
then
the
knight
rose
up
and
departed
and
when
the
fiend
saw
him
depart
he
took
a
halter
and
put
it
round
his
neck
and
was
fain
to
hang
himself
but
this
he
could
not
do
many
times
had
he
essayed
the
same
but
had
ever
failed
as
they
journeyed
on
the
lady
una
perceived
that
her
knight
for
all
that
he
was
healed
of
his
sickness
was
feeble
and
faint
and
unfit
for
combat
if
such
should
come
in
his
way
now
she
knew
of
an
ancient
house
of
rest
which
was
in
those
parts
where
he
might
have
refreshment
and
recover
his
strength
the
hostess
name
was
cælia
which
being
interpreted
is
heavenly
and
she
had
three
and
speranza
and
charissa
the
last
a
matron
with
fair
children
the
others
maidens
promised
in
marriage
there
the
knight
tarried
many
days
much
discipline
did
he
endure
for
the
removing
of
his
faults
and
weaknesses
and
much
comfort
also
was
ministered
to
him
and
many
things
was
he
taught
and
when
his
heart
had
been
thus
strengthened
and
purified
then
did
the
lady
cælia
commend
him
to
the
care
of
a
most
venerable
sire
who
was
chief
among
her
ministers
the
same
showed
him
many
fair
and
noble
sights
and
last
of
all
on
a
mountain
side
a
way
that
was
both
steep
and
long
and
at
the
end
of
the
way
a
fair
city
whose
walls
were
builded
high
of
pearls
and
all
manner
of
precious
stones
and
as
the
knight
gazed
thereat
he
saw
angels
ascending
thereto
and
descending
therefrom
then
said
he
to
his
guide
tell
me
sir
what

he
is
the
new
jerusalem
which
god
has
built
as
a
for
his
verily
said
the
knight
i
thought
that
cleopolis
the
abode
of
the
great
gloriana
was
the
fairest
of
all
cities
but
this
does
far
excel
yea
answered
the
holy
man
that
is
true
beyond
all
doubt
and
yet
this
same
cleopolis
is
worthy
to
be
the
abode
of
all
true
knights
and
the
service
of
queen
gloriana
a
most
honourable
thing
and
you
fair
sir
have
chosen
a
good
part
rendering
thus
obedience
to
her
command
and
succouring
on
her
behalf
this
distressed
lady
and
i
give
you
this
counsel
when
you
have
won
your
great
victory
and
have
hung
your
shield
high
among
the
shields
of
the
most
famous
knights
of
the
world
then
turn
your
thoughts
to
better
things
wash
your
hands
clean
from
the
stain
of
blood
for
blood
though
it
be
shed
in
a
righteous
cause
must
make
a
stain
so
shall
you
tread
the
steep
and
narrow
path
which
leads
to
this
fair
city
the
new
jerusalem
there
is
a
mansion
prepared
for
you
thus
you
shall
be
numbered
among
the
saints
and
shall
be
the
friend
and
patron
of
the
land
which
gave
you
birth
having
for
your
style
and
title
saint
george
of
then
said
the
knight
dare
i
hope
being
such
as
i
am
to
attain
to
such
a
grace
yea
said
the
sage
others
of
the
like
degree
have
so
but
must
i
leave
behind
all
the
delights
of
war
and
love
be
content
answered
the
sage
in
that
joy
are
all
joys
but
said
the
knight
if
this
world
is
so
vain
a
thing
why
should
i
turn
to
it
again
may
i
not
abide
here
in
peace
till
i
can
set
forth
on
that
last
voyage
nay
said
the
sage
that
may
not
be
thou
must
maintain
this
lady
s
cause
and
do
the
work
that
has
been
committed
to
you
but
now
learn
the
secret
of
your
birth
you
are
of
the
ancient
race
of
british
kings
but
a
fairy
stole
you
from
your
cradle
and
laid
you
in
a
furrow
there
a
certain
ploughman
found
you
and
designing
to
bring
you
up
to
his
own
craft
called
you
george
which
is
by
interpretation
worker
of
the
so
the
knight
went
back
to
cælia
s
abode
not
a
little
comforted
and
encouraged
chapter
x
of
the
slaying
of
the
dragon
the
time
was
now
come
when
the
knight
must
perform
the
task
which
he
had
taken
in
hand
he
departed
therefore
from
the
house
of
rest
nor
had
he
journeyed
far
when
the
lady
una
said
to
him
see
now
the
brazen
tower
in
which
my
father
and
mother
are
imprisoned
for
fear
of
the
dragon
and
lo
there
is
the
watchman
on
the
wall
waiting
for
good
scarcely
had
she
spoken
when
they
heard
a
dreadful
sound
of
roaring
and
looking
they
saw
the
dragon
lying
on
the
sunny
side
of
a
hill
and
he
was
like
a
hill
himself
so
great
he
was
nor
did
he
fail
to
note
the
glitter
of
arms
for
he
was
a
watchful
beast
and
made
all
haste
to
meet
his
enemy
then
said
the
knight
to
una
the
hour
is
come
stand
aside
on
yonder
hill
where
you
may
watch
the
battle
and
be
safe
meanwhile
the
dragon
came
on
half
flying
and
half
on
foot
such
haste
did
he
make
never
was
seen
upon
the
earth
so
terrible
a
beast
he
looked
like
to
a
mountain
as
he
came
so
much
of
the
earth
did
he
cover
so
high
did
he
rear
himself
in
air
so
broad
a
shadow
did
he
cast
he
was
covered
all
over
with
scales
as
of
brass
or
iron
fitting
so
close
together
that
neither
edge
of
sword
nor
point
of
spear
could
pierce
them
on
either
side
he
spread
out
two
great
wings
like
to
the
sails
of
some
tall
ship
behind
was
a
great
tail
wound
in
a
hundred
folds
and
covering
full
three
furlongs
huge
knots
it
had
each
like
to
a
shield
and
at
the
end
were
two
great
stings
armed
each
with
deadliest
poison
but
more
cruel
even
than
the
stings
were
his
claws
so
mighty
were
they
and
so
sharp
to
rend
asunder
all
that
they
should
touch
and
yet
more
cruel
than
his
claws
was
his
monstrous
head
with
rows
of
teeth
strong
as
iron
set
in
either
jaw
while
out
of
his
throat
came
forth
a
smoking
breath
with
sulphurous
stench
deep
set
in
his
head
were
his
two
great
eyes
large
as
shields
and
burning
with
wrath
as
with
fire
like
to
two
broad
beacons
set
upon
a
hill
to
give
warning
of
the
foe
s
approach
to
all
the
shires
around
such
was
the
dragon
to
behold
and
as
he
came
on
he
might
be
seen
to
rear
his
neck
as
in
pride
while
his
scales
bristled
with
dreadful
sight
which
made
even
the
knight
s
bold
heart
grow
cold
for
a
space
with
fear
but
not
the
less
boldly
did
he
address
himself
to
the
fight
laying
his
spear
in
rest
he
charged
with
all
his
might
full
on
the
monster
s
carcase
struck
the
spear
but
could
not
pierce
those
scales
so
stout
and
closely
set
they
were
only
so
shrewd
was
the
blow
that
the
dragon
felt
the
shock
within
never
had
such
been
dealt
to
him
before
though
he
had
met
many
a
gallant
knight
in
combat
so
he
spread
wide
his
wings
and
lifting
himself
in
air
circled
round
till
swooping
down
he
seized
knight
and
steed
with
his
claws
and
lifted
them
from
the
earth
for
a
whole
s
length
he
carried
them
but
then
was
constrained
to
loose
them
so
fierce
the
struggle
which
they
made
so
you
may
see
a
hawk
when
he
has
pounced
upon
some
bird
that
is
too
heavy
for
his
flight
carry
his
prey
awhile
but
is
then
constrained
to
drop
him
from
his
claws
again
did
the
knight
so
restored
to
the
earth
charge
his
foe
again
did
the
spear
glance
aside
though
there
was
the
force
as
of
three
men
in
the
blow
yet
was
not
the
thrust
all
in
vain
so
fierce
was
the
shock
that
the
dragon
was
constrained
to
raise
his
wing
and
there
where
the
flesh
was
bare
of
shelter
the
spear
point
made
a
grisly
wound
the
beast
caught
the
spear
shaft
with
his
claws
and
brake
it
short
but
the
head
stuck
fast
while
the
blood
poured
out
amain
then
in
his
rage
he
vomited
forth
great
flames
of
fire
and
bending
round
his
tail
caught
the
knight
s
horse
by
the
legs
and
he
fiercely
struggling
to
free
himself
threw
his
rider
to
the
ground
ill
content
with
this
fall
for
it
seemed
as
a
dishonour
to
him
he
snatched
his
his
spear
he
had
been
smote
the
dragon
on
his
crest
the
crest
did
not
yield
to
the
blow
so
stoutly
was
it
cased
about
but
the
creature
felt
the
shock
through
all
his
mighty
frame
yet
again
the
knight
smote
him
and
once
more
the
sword
glanced
aside
as
if
from
a
rock
of
adamant
yet
was
not
the
labour
spent
in
vain
for
now
the
beast
seeking
to
avoid
his
enemy
would
have
raised
himself
in
air
but
that
the
wounded
wing
could
not
perform
its
office
then
in
his
fury
he
brayed
aloud
and
vomited
forth
from
his
throat
so
fierce
a
flame
that
it
scorched
the
face
of
the
knight
and
set
his
beard
on
fire
and
seared
his
flesh
through
his
armour
grievous
was
the
pain
and
scarcely
to
be
borne
not
less
than
that
which
hercules
of
old
endured
when
the
fiery
robe
steeped
in
the
centaur
s
blood
wrapped
him
round
he
stood
astonished
and
helpless
and
when
the
dragon
saw
how
he
fared
he
dealt
him
a
great
blow
with
his
tail
and
so
brought
him
headlong
to
the
ground
then
indeed
it
had
gone
ill
with
him
but
for
the
happy
chance
that
behind
him
there
was
a
spring
which
sent
forth
a
stream
of
water
silvery
bright
and
of
great
virtue
for
the
healing
of
all
wounds
and
sicknesses
men
in
the
old
time
before
the
dragon
had
wasted
the
land
called
it
the
well
of
life
and
though
it
was
now
for
the
most
part
forgotten
yet
had
it
not
lost
its
healing
powers
it
could
restore
him
that
was
wasted
with
sickness
ay
and
raise
the
dead
there
was
no
spring
on
earth
that
could
be
matched
with
it
but
of
this
the
dragon
was
should
he
know
of
such
things
when
he
saw
his
adversary
fall
headlong
into
the
water
he
clapped
his
wings
for
joy
this
the
lady
una
saw
from
the
hill
whereon
she
sat
watching
the
fight
sorely
did
it
dismay
her
nevertheless
she
did
not
wholly
lose
her
hope
but
prayed
all
night
to
god
that
it
might
yet
be
well
with
the
knight
when
the
next
morning
dawned
in
the
sky
she
looked
and
lo
her
champion
stood
all
refreshed
and
ready
for
the
fray
nor
did
the
dragon
draw
back
from
the
encounter
straightway
the
knight
lifting
high
his
sword
dealt
a
great
blow
at
the
monster
s
crest
and
this
time
whether
the
sacred
spring
had
given
a
keener
edge
to
the
steel
or
had
put
new
strength
into
the
arm
which
wielded
it
it
did
that
which
never
steel
had
done
before
for
it
made
a
great
yawning
wound
then
the
dragon
wrought
to
fury
by
the
pain
lifted
his
tail
high
over
his
head
and
brought
down
upon
his
adversary
the
deadly
double
sting
which
lay
in
the
end
through
the
shield
it
made
its
way
and
fixed
itself
in
his
shoulder
grievous
was
the
smart
but
the
knight
thinking
only
of
victory
and
honour
did
not
flinch
beneath
it
but
gathering
all
his
strength
shore
off
the
furthest
joints
of
the
tail
so
that
not
the
half
of
it
was
left
but
not
yet
was
the
battle
won
for
now
the
dragon
laid
his
two
mighty
claws
upon
the
knight
seizing
his
foot
with
one
and
his
shield
with
the
other
sorely
was
he
now
beset
for
though
with
a
blow
of
his
sword
he
rid
himself
of
the
one
claw
the
other
held
him
fast
at
the
same
time
there
burst
forth
from
the
monsters
mouth
such
blasts
of
fire
such
clouds
of
smoke
that
he
was
constrained
to
retire
a
little
backward
and
so
retiring
he
slipped
in
the
mire
and
fell
yet
the
matter
turned
to
his
good
for
the
same
spring
of
life
refreshed
and
healed
him
as
before
nor
did
the
dragon
dare
to
come
near
for
he
could
not
have
aught
to
do
with
a
thing
so
pure
and
holy
and
so
the
second
day
came
to
its
ending
this
night
also
did
the
lady
una
pray
for
her
knight
throughout
the
hours
of
darkness
and
the
morning
found
her
watching
as
before
but
with
the
third
day
came
a
speedy
end
to
that
fierce
encounter
the
dragon
full
of
rage
to
be
so
baulked
of
his
prey
ran
at
the
knight
with
mouth
wide
open
as
if
to
swallow
him
alive
and
he
was
not
slow
to
seize
the
occasion
for
his
foe
had
laid
bare
before
him
its
most
vital
part
right
into
the
monster
s
mouth
he
drove
his
sword
with
all
the
strength
that
was
in
him
nor
had
he
need
to
strike
again
for
the
monster
fell
as
falls
some
cliff
which
the
waves
of
the
sea
for
many
years
have
worn
away
high
and
strong
it
seems
to
stand
but
it
falls
far
and
wide
in
sudden
ruin
there
is
no
need
to
tell
in
many
words
how
the
king
and
queen
of
that
land
came
forth
from
their
prison
with
great
gladness
and
how
the
people
of
the
land
rejoiced
to
be
rid
of
so
foul
a
tyranny
and
how
the
lady
una
seemed
to
be
fairer
than
ever
when
she
came
forth
in
her
robe
of
state
and
how
the
knight
and
she
were
duly
betrothed
fain
would
i
stay
said
the
knight
but
i
am
under
promise
to
queen
gloriana
to
serve
her
for
six
years
against
the
so
be
it
said
the
king
of
the
land
go
keep
your
promise
as
becomes
a
noble
knight
and
know
that
when
you
shall
return
you
shall
have
my
daughter
to
wife
and
my
kingdom
also
for
this
i
have
ever
purposed
in
my
heart
that
he
who
should
deliver
it
from
the
foul
tyranny
should
have
it
for
his
own
for
none
could
be
more
chapter
xi
of
sir
guyon
and
the
lady
medina
archimage
did
not
suffer
long
from
his
overthrow
by
sansloy
for
he
had
devices
at
his
command
by
which
he
could
recover
himself
from
all
sicknesses
howsoever
sore
they
might
be
and
being
recovered
he
set
himself
to
do
some
hurt
to
the
knight
who
by
this
time
had
bidden
farewell
to
the
lady
una
and
was
journeying
to
render
service
to
queen
gloriana
as
he
was
travelling
with
this
purpose
in
his
heart
he
came
upon
a
very
noble
knight
clad
in
armour
from
top
to
toe
who
was
riding
slowly
along
the
road
reigning
back
his
horse
s
pace
to
suit
the
steps
of
a
venerable
pilgrim
who
journeyed
by
his
side
archimage
laid
his
hand
upon
the
neck
of
the
knight
s
horse
and
said
sir
knight
i
pray
you
to
help
one
who
is
sadly
in
need
of
succour
for
himself
and
for
another
of
whom
he
is
in
and
while
he
spoke
he
made
great
pretence
of
fear
and
trouble
trembling
and
weeping
speak
on
answered
sir
guyon
for
this
was
the
knight
s
name
speak
on
and
i
will
not
fail
to
help
you
and
the
other
of
whom
you
oh
sir
said
archimage
i
am
a
squire
and
i
have
a
lady
in
charge
to
deliver
her
to
her
parents
but
there
is
a
certain
knight
who
hinders
me
i
know
not
what
i
shall
do
and
she
goes
in
deadly
fear
that
some
great
harm
will
happen
to
and
where
is
the
lady
asked
sir
guyon
come
sir
the
false
squire
made
answer
and
i
will
bring
you
to
so
the
two
went
together
and
found
a
lady
sitting
under
a
tree
weeping
sore
with
her
garments
all
dishevelled
and
torn
fair
lady
said
sir
guyon
it
troubles
me
much
to
see
you
in
this
plight
but
take
heart
i
will
surely
call
him
who
has
done
you
any
wrong
to
strict
account
but
let
me
hear
your
so
she
told
him
her
tale
and
when
she
had
ended
he
said
but
who
is
this
man
by
what
name
or
by
what
signs
shall
i
know
him
his
name
said
she
i
know
not
but
this
i
know
that
he
rode
upon
a
steed
of
dappled
grey
and
that
he
carried
a
shield
of
silver
with
a
red
cross
upon
now
by
my
head
cried
sir
guyon
i
know
this
same
knight
and
i
wonder
such
that
he
should
have
behaved
so
ill
he
is
a
good
knight
and
a
true
and
i
hear
has
won
great
renown
in
the
cause
of
a
fair
lady
i
was
myself
present
in
the
queen
s
court
when
he
took
this
task
upon
himself
which
he
has
now
performed
with
great
honour
nevertheless
i
will
try
him
in
this
matter
and
he
must
needs
either
show
that
he
is
free
from
blame
or
make
due
now
she
that
made
all
this
show
of
grief
was
the
false
duessa
and
archimage
had
found
her
wandering
in
miserable
plight
after
prince
arthur
had
dealt
with
her
as
has
been
told
above
and
having
found
her
he
decked
her
out
with
robes
and
ornaments
and
made
her
to
appear
passing
fair
such
arts
he
had
this
he
did
because
she
helped
him
much
when
he
would
tempt
a
knight
into
evil
ways
and
now
squire
said
sir
guyon
can
you
lead
me
to
the
place
where
the
knight
of
whom
you
make
this
complaint
may
be
found
that
can
i
said
archimage
and
he
led
him
to
a
shady
valley
hard
by
in
the
midst
of
which
was
a
stream
both
clear
and
cold
and
on
the
bank
of
the
stream
sat
a
knight
with
his
helmet
unlaced
who
drank
of
the
water
as
one
who
was
resting
after
a
long
journey
sir
said
archimage
yonder
is
the
evil
knight
he
would
fain
hide
himself
from
the
punishment
of
his
then
sir
guyon
addressed
himself
to
the
fight
and
the
knight
likewise
but
ere
they
encountered
each
other
they
stayed
their
hands
pardon
me
fair
sir
that
i
had
set
my
spear
against
the
sacred
badge
which
you
bear
upon
your
and
i
too
answered
the
knight
would
likewise
crave
pardon
for
like
violence
to
that
fair
image
of
a
maiden
which
is
your
then
they
held
converse
together
sir
guyon
told
his
tale
but
when
he
had
ended
it
he
looked
and
lo
the
false
squire
the
deceiver
archimage
had
fled
knowing
that
his
device
had
come
to
naught
and
now
the
pilgrim
that
bore
sir
guyon
company
came
up
and
when
he
saw
the
knight
he
said
fair
son
god
give
you
praise
and
peace
for
ever
you
indeed
have
won
your
place
but
ours
is
yet
to
his
be
the
praise
answered
the
knight
by
whose
grace
i
am
what
i
so
they
parted
with
much
courtesy
going
each
his
several
way
after
a
while
they
came
to
a
fair
castle
by
the
sea
where
the
lady
medina
had
her
dwelling
sir
guyon
toiling
painfully
on
foot
because
when
he
was
helping
an
unhappy
traveller
a
knave
had
stolen
away
his
horse
this
lady
medina
was
one
of
three
sisters
and
of
the
three
elissa
was
the
eldest
and
perissa
the
youngest
these
two
were
always
at
variance
not
a
little
with
medina
but
still
more
with
each
other
and
she
being
always
of
an
equal
mind
and
wise
conduct
had
the
chief
authority
in
the
place
though
indeed
their
father
had
left
it
to
the
three
in
equal
shares
elissa
had
for
lover
a
certain
sir
hudibras
a
famous
knight
but
in
deeds
scarce
equal
to
his
high
repute
he
had
a
most
mighty
body
and
sturdy
limbs
but
his
wit
was
small
perissa
s
knight
was
sansloy
of
whom
mention
has
already
been
made
never
was
man
more
reckless
indeed
more
careless
of
right
and
wrong
so
soon
as
these
two
heard
that
a
stranger
knight
was
come
to
the
castle
then
they
issued
forth
to
fight
with
him
their
ladies
following
yet
such
was
their
folly
that
even
on
the
way
they
fell
out
and
joined
in
deadly
fray
to
the
great
disturbance
of
the
house
much
did
sir
guyon
marvel
as
entering
the
hall
he
saw
the
fray
this
said
he
to
himself
must
have
an
end
and
carrying
his
shield
on
his
left
arm
and
with
his
right
hand
unsheathing
his
sword
he
ran
in
between
the
two
they
with
one
consent
turned
their
arms
against
him
just
as
a
bear
and
tiger
in
the
desert
plains
of
africa
when
some
traveller
comes
in
sight
leave
their
strife
and
fall
upon
him
with
one
mind
it
was
a
strange
fight
indeed
and
sir
guyon
had
fared
ill
but
for
his
surpassing
strength
and
courage
and
even
these
might
have
failed
him
in
a
conflict
so
unequal
but
that
the
lady
medina
hearing
in
her
bower
of
what
had
befallen
ran
forth
with
bare
bosom
and
dishevelled
hair
and
fell
on
her
knees
and
besought
them
to
abate
their
strife
now
my
lords
she
cried
by
the
mothers
that
bare
you
and
by
the
love
that
you
have
for
your
fair
ladies
and
by
the
knighthood
to
which
you
owe
your
homage
i
beseech
you
to
put
away
this
fury
and
to
be
at
peace
among
so
she
besought
them
and
though
the
two
sisters
stood
by
not
helping
a
whit
but
rather
stirring
up
each
her
champion
to
fiercer
wrath
she
prevailed
the
knights
let
fall
their
swords
and
bowed
their
heads
before
her
and
vowed
to
do
her
bidding
then
she
fearing
that
their
resolve
might
be
unstable
bound
them
by
a
treaty
which
they
on
their
part
swore
on
their
knightly
honour
that
they
would
keep
for
all
time
to
come
this
done
she
bade
them
all
both
knights
and
ladies
to
a
fair
banquet
and
when
they
had
had
enough
of
meat
and
drink
she
said
tell
us
sir
knight
on
what
errand
you
are
come
and
what
end
you
then
said
sir
guyon
what
you
ask
brings
to
my
mind
that
great
queen
fairest
and
best
of
all
that
are
in
the
wide
world
she
is
wont
to
make
a
great
feast
on
the
first
day
of
the
new
year
to
which
come
all
knights
that
seek
adventure
and
desire
to
gain
honour
for
themselves
at
this
feast
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
i
was
present
and
it
came
to
pass
that
this
pilgrim
whom
you
have
bidden
with
me
to
your
feast
stood
forth
before
the
queen
and
made
his
complaint
of
a
certain
wicked
fairy
that
wasted
the
land
wherein
he
dwelt
and
wrought
great
damage
to
its
inhabitants
and
when
he
had
ended
the
queen
set
this
task
to
me
unworthy
as
i
am
nor
did
i
refuse
to
take
it
in
hand
now
the
name
of
this
wicked
fairy
is
acrasia
three
times
has
the
moon
waxed
and
waned
since
that
day
and
i
have
already
seen
full
proofs
of
the
mischief
which
she
works
to
subdue
her
therefore
and
to
bring
her
captive
into
the
presence
of
queen
gloriana
is
the
purpose
which
i
set
before
then
the
night
being
now
far
spent
all
the
guests
betook
themselves
to
sleep
chapter
xii
how
sir
guyon
came
into
great
peril
many
perils
did
sir
guyon
encounter
which
it
would
take
too
long
time
to
tell
nor
were
there
perils
only
of
battle
such
as
befell
in
the
meeting
of
pagan
knights
and
the
like
for
such
he
was
well
prepared
never
did
sturdier
champion
lay
spear
in
rest
or
wage
war
at
close
quarters
with
his
sword
force
could
not
overcome
him
but
he
could
be
led
astray
by
fraud
so
it
was
when
in
his
journeyings
he
came
to
a
broad
water
which
seemed
to
bar
his
way
while
he
stood
at
the
water
s
brink
wondering
how
he
might
win
his
way
farther
suddenly
there
was
seen
hard
by
a
little
boat
rowed
by
a
fair
damsel
when
he
had
told
his
need
she
said
be
content
fair
sir
step
you
aboard
and
i
will
take
you
to
the
place
which
you
so
sir
guyon
nothing
doubting
stepped
into
the
boat
but
when
he
would
have
taken
his
guide
the
pilgrim
with
him
he
was
denied
nay
nay
said
the
damsel
we
have
not
space
for
the
old
man
on
this
and
even
while
she
was
speaking
the
boat
was
already
far
from
the
land
for
indeed
it
was
a
magic
craft
nor
could
he
even
say
farewell
the
two
had
pleasant
converse
awhile
for
the
damsel
was
gay
and
debonair
and
the
knight
courteous
nevertheless
he
somewhat
misliked
her
manner
and
when
in
a
short
space
they
came
to
the
other
side
of
the
water
he
perceived
that
he
had
been
led
astray
and
was
not
a
little
displeased
lady
said
he
you
have
done
me
a
wrong
this
is
not
the
place
which
i
sought
i
did
not
think
when
i
followed
your
bidding
that
you
would
so
deceive
sir
knight
she
answered
he
that
will
travel
by
water
can
not
always
command
his
way
winds
and
waves
will
not
answer
to
his
call
the
sea
is
wide
and
tis
easy
to
go
astray
thereon
yet
here
methinks
you
may
abide
awhile
in
so
sir
guyon
stepped
upon
the
shore
though
he
was
but
to
find
himself
in
such
a
plight
nevertheless
he
could
not
but
perceive
that
it
was
a
right
pleasant
place
to
which
he
had
come
for
the
ground
was
covered
with
flowers
and
the
trees
were
green
with
the
fresh
leaves
of
spring
and
the
sweet
singing
of
birds
was
heard
on
every
side
and
fairer
and
more
pleasant
than
all
else
was
the
damsel
of
the
boat
nevertheless
sir
guyon
was
ever
on
the
watch
nor
would
he
suffer
himself
to
be
beguiled
maybe
he
said
to
himself
this
fair
dame
designs
to
turn
me
from
my
quest
why
did
she
as
by
design
part
me
from
my
guide
why
did
she
turn
me
aside
from
the
way
in
which
i
desired
to
go
this
was
more
i
doubt
not
than
an
idle
she
on
the
other
hand
perceived
that
she
had
failed
of
her
intent
and
was
in
truth
as
willing
that
he
should
go
as
he
was
eager
to
depart
so
after
a
while
she
said
fair
knight
i
perceive
that
it
irks
you
to
abide
in
this
place
suffer
me
therefore
to
carry
you
to
the
other
well
content
he
stepped
into
the
boat
and
was
ferried
across
in
the
shortest
space
of
time
so
he
passed
through
this
peril
it
seemed
without
hurt
save
indeed
that
he
had
lost
his
guide
for
the
damsel
in
her
craft
took
him
to
a
place
far
from
where
the
guide
had
been
left
and
this
losing
of
the
guide
was
as
will
be
seen
a
very
sore
hurt
indeed
after
a
while
he
came
to
a
gloomy
valley
covered
in
on
all
sides
from
the
light
of
heaven
with
the
thick
branches
of
trees
and
here
in
the
deepest
and
darkest
shade
he
saw
sitting
a
man
of
a
most
uncouth
and
savage
aspect
having
his
face
all
dark
with
smoke
and
his
eyes
bleared
and
the
hair
of
his
head
and
his
beard
covered
with
soot
his
hands
were
black
as
the
hands
of
one
who
works
in
a
forge
and
his
nails
were
like
to
claws
he
had
an
iron
coat
all
rusty
above
but
underneath
of
gold
and
finely
wrought
with
curious
devices
though
indeed
it
was
covered
with
dust
and
grime
in
his
lap
he
had
a
mass
of
golden
coin
which
he
counted
turning
over
each
piece
as
if
he
would
feed
his
eyes
with
the
delight
of
seeing
them
round
about
him
were
great
heaps
of
gold
some
of
them
of
rude
ore
not
yet
smelted
in
the
furnace
and
some
smelted
newly
in
great
squares
and
ingots
and
others
in
round
plates
without
device
but
for
the
most
part
they
bore
the
devices
of
ancient
kings
and
cæsars
when
the
man
beheld
sir
guyon
he
rose
as
in
great
fear
as
if
he
would
hide
this
precious
store
from
a
stranger
s
eyes
and
began
to
pour
it
into
a
great
hole
that
was
thereby
but
sir
guyon
leaping
forward
caught
him
by
the
hand
and
though
he
was
not
a
little
dismayed
by
the
things
which
he
saw
restrained
him
man
he
said
if
indeed
man
you
are
why
sit
you
here
apart
hiding
these
piles
of
wealth
and
keeping
them
from
being
rightly
used
by
men
truly
answered
the
man
you
are
bold
and
careless
of
yourself
thus
to
trouble
me
know
that
i
am
the
god
of
this
world
the
greatest
god
under
heaven
mammon
by
name
from
me
come
riches
and
renown
powers
and
honours
and
all
things
which
men
covet
upon
earth
know
then
that
if
you
will
serve
me
all
these
mountains
of
riches
shall
be
yours
and
if
these
do
not
content
you
i
will
give
you
tenfold
mammon
answered
the
knight
in
vain
do
you
boast
your
godhead
in
vain
do
you
offer
me
your
gifts
keep
them
for
such
as
covet
such
idle
things
and
look
for
a
more
fitting
servant
i
am
of
those
who
regard
honour
and
strive
for
kingdoms
fair
shields
and
steeds
gaily
bedight
and
shining
arms
are
pleasant
to
my
do
you
not
perceive
answered
mammon
o
foolish
knight
that
money
can
furnish
all
these
things
in
which
you
delight
shields
and
steeds
and
arms
it
can
provide
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
ay
and
crowns
and
kingdoms
also
i
can
throw
down
into
the
dust
him
that
sits
upon
the
throne
and
i
can
lift
up
to
the
throne
him
that
lies
in
the
but
i
said
sir
guyon
have
other
thoughts
of
riches
that
infinite
mischiefs
spring
from
and
debate
and
bloodshed
no
crowns
nor
kingdoms
are
yours
but
you
turn
loyal
truth
to
treason
you
break
the
sacred
diadem
in
pieces
and
rend
the
purple
robe
of
kingship
it
is
of
you
that
castles
are
surprised
great
cities
sacked
and
burned
and
kingdoms
overthrown
then
mammon
waxed
wroth
and
cried
why
then
are
men
so
eager
to
obtain
a
thing
so
evil
why
do
they
so
complain
when
they
have
it
not
and
when
they
lose
it
so
upbraid
and
when
the
knight
answered
these
questions
by
telling
of
how
in
the
old
time
man
was
content
without
riches
and
how
he
had
been
corrupted
by
the
lust
of
gold
and
silver
mammon
replied
nay
my
son
let
be
these
stories
of
ancient
days
you
who
live
in
these
latter
times
must
be
content
to
take
your
wage
for
the
work
you
do
come
now
you
shall
have
what
you
will
of
these
riches
and
if
you
like
them
not
then
you
are
free
to
refuse
only
if
you
refuse
blame
me
not
then
said
the
knight
for
being
but
mortal
man
he
was
touched
by
the
sight
of
great
riches
i
would
not
take
aught
that
is
offered
me
unless
i
know
that
it
has
been
rightly
got
how
can
i
be
assured
that
you
have
not
taken
these
things
unlawfully
from
the
rightful
owner
nay
cried
mammon
that
is
but
idle
talk
never
did
eye
behold
these
things
never
did
hand
handle
them
i
have
kept
them
secret
both
from
heaven
and
from
but
said
the
knight
what
place
is
large
enough
to
hold
such
store
or
safe
enough
to
keep
it
from
robbery
come
and
see
answered
mammon
and
the
knight
followed
him
but
he
had
done
more
wisely
to
stay
behind
mammon
led
him
through
the
depths
of
the
wood
till
they
came
to
a
secret
way
which
was
hollowed
out
in
the
earth
this
they
entered
and
followed
awhile
till
they
came
to
where
it
opened
out
into
a
wide
plain
across
the
plain
there
was
a
broad
highway
which
led
to
the
dwelling
of
pluto
on
either
side
of
this
road
were
dreadful
holding
an
iron
whip
and
strife
with
a
bloody
knife
in
his
hand
and
revenge
and
treason
and
jealousy
fear
also
was
there
ever
trembling
and
seeking
in
vain
where
he
might
hide
himself
and
sorrow
crouching
in
darkness
and
shame
hiding
her
face
from
every
eye
so
they
came
at
last
to
a
narrow
door
which
stood
fast
shut
with
one
which
was
yawning
wide
open
hard
by
the
narrow
door
was
the
door
of
riches
and
the
wide
the
door
of
hell
this
opened
to
mammon
of
its
own
accord
and
sir
guyon
followed
him
fearing
nothing
but
behind
the
knight
there
followed
close
a
monstrous
fiend
watching
him
that
he
might
do
him
to
death
if
he
should
lay
a
covetous
hand
or
cast
a
longing
eye
on
anything
he
might
see
for
such
was
the
law
of
the
place
the
walls
and
the
floor
and
the
roof
were
all
gold
but
covered
with
dust
and
decay
and
piled
up
on
every
side
were
huge
chests
of
iron
bound
all
of
them
with
double
bands
and
on
the
floor
were
the
bones
of
dead
men
who
in
time
past
had
sought
to
win
some
spoil
for
themselves
and
so
had
come
by
their
death
but
not
a
word
did
sir
guyon
speak
so
they
came
to
a
great
door
of
iron
this
too
opened
to
them
as
of
its
own
accord
and
showed
such
a
store
of
wealth
as
could
not
be
seen
in
all
the
world
beside
then
mammon
turned
to
the
knight
and
said
see
now
the
happiness
of
the
world
here
is
that
for
which
men
strive
and
struggle
lo
i
lay
before
you
all
that
you
can
the
knight
answered
i
do
refuse
your
proffered
grace
i
seek
not
to
be
made
happy
in
such
fashion
i
set
before
mine
eyes
another
happiness
i
seek
another
end
i
would
spend
my
life
in
brave
deeds
i
desire
rather
to
be
lord
of
them
who
have
riches
than
to
have
them
for
mammon
gnashed
his
teeth
to
hear
such
an
answer
for
he
had
thought
that
the
sight
would
overcome
the
soul
of
any
mortal
man
and
that
being
so
overcome
the
knight
would
be
his
prey
but
not
yet
did
he
give
up
all
hope
he
led
him
into
yet
another
chamber
in
which
were
a
hundred
furnaces
all
ablaze
and
at
every
furnace
strange
creatures
busy
at
work
some
worked
the
bellows
which
raised
the
fire
to
white
heat
and
some
scummed
off
the
dross
from
the
molten
gold
and
some
stirred
it
with
great
ladles
but
when
they
saw
the
shape
of
mortal
man
they
all
ceased
from
their
work
and
looked
at
him
with
wondering
eyes
and
he
was
not
a
little
dismayed
to
see
them
so
foul
and
hideous
were
they
to
behold
then
mammon
spoke
again
see
now
what
mortal
eye
has
never
seen
before
you
would
know
whence
come
the
riches
which
men
so
fervently
desire
look
here
you
see
their
source
and
origin
here
is
the
fountain
of
the
world
s
whole
wealth
think
and
change
your
mood
lest
haply
hereafter
you
may
wish
and
not
be
able
to
said
the
knight
mammon
once
more
i
refuse
the
thing
which
you
offer
i
have
all
that
i
need
why
should
i
ask
for
more
suffer
me
to
follow
my
own
great
was
mammon
s
wrath
to
hear
his
offers
so
refused
but
he
would
try
yet
another
temptation
he
took
the
knight
into
a
very
lofty
spacious
chamber
in
which
was
assembled
a
great
company
of
people
from
every
nation
under
heaven
all
of
them
were
pressing
forward
with
great
uproar
to
the
chamber
s
upper
end
where
upon
a
dais
was
set
a
lofty
throne
on
the
throne
there
sat
a
woman
gorgeously
attired
clad
in
such
royal
robes
as
never
were
worn
by
earthly
prince
right
fair
of
face
was
she
to
behold
of
such
a
beauty
that
she
seemed
as
it
were
to
make
a
brightness
in
the
chamber
but
the
beauty
was
not
indeed
her
own
it
was
but
a
pretence
cunningly
devised
to
delude
the
hearts
of
men
in
her
hand
she
held
a
great
chain
of
which
the
upper
end
was
fastened
to
the
sky
and
the
lower
went
down
into
hell
all
the
crowd
that
thronged
about
her
sought
to
lay
hold
of
this
same
chain
hoping
thereby
to
climb
to
some
high
estate
some
were
fain
to
rise
by
the
help
of
riches
and
some
by
flattery
and
some
by
help
of
friendship
but
all
thought
only
of
themselves
and
they
that
were
high
kept
others
down
and
they
that
were
low
would
not
suffer
others
to
rise
every
man
was
against
his
fellow
then
said
sir
guyon
what
means
this
that
i
see
what
is
this
throng
that
crowds
about
the
lady
s
throne
and
the
lady
who
is
she
mammon
answered
that
fair
lady
about
whom
these
people
crowd
is
my
own
dear
daughter
her
name
is
philotime
which
being
interpreted
is
love
of
honour
she
is
the
fairest
woman
on
the
earth
could
you
but
see
her
in
the
upper
air
for
the
darkness
of
the
place
hides
her
beauty
her
if
you
will
you
shall
have
to
wife
that
she
may
advance
you
to
high
i
thank
you
sir
said
the
knight
for
the
honour
which
you
design
for
me
but
i
am
only
mortal
man
and
not
fit
match
for
an
immortal
mate
and
were
it
otherwise
my
troth
is
given
to
another
and
it
would
ill
become
a
loyal
knight
to
break
his
again
was
mammon
greatly
moved
to
wrath
but
he
hid
it
in
his
heart
and
led
the
knight
into
a
garden
full
of
herbs
and
trees
not
such
as
earth
puts
forth
in
the
upper
air
to
delight
the
souls
of
men
but
such
as
have
about
them
the
atmosphere
of
death
the
cypress
was
there
and
the
black
ebony
and
hemlock
which
unjust
athens
gave
in
old
times
to
socrates
wisest
of
mortal
men
these
were
gloomy
to
behold
but
in
the
midst
was
a
tree
splendid
with
apples
of
gold
hercules
planted
it
with
the
apples
which
he
won
from
the
garden
of
the
daughters
of
atlas
and
it
bore
fruits
which
were
the
occasions
of
strife
such
as
that
which
discord
threw
among
the
guests
at
the
of
peleus
and
thetis
for
the
fairest
was
written
on
it
hence
came
the
strife
of
the
goddesses
and
the
judgment
of
paris
and
the
stealing
of
helen
and
the
bringing
to
the
ground
of
the
towers
of
troy
much
did
the
knight
marvel
to
see
the
tree
for
it
spread
its
branches
far
and
wide
across
the
garden
and
even
beyond
the
garden
s
bounds
for
it
was
compassed
about
with
a
great
mound
and
the
knight
desiring
to
see
all
that
could
be
seen
of
so
strange
a
place
climbed
upon
the
bank
and
looked
and
lo
there
flowed
below
it
a
dark
and
dismal
stream
which
men
call
the
river
of
wailing
in
this
he
saw
many
miserable
creatures
and
one
he
noted
especially
who
was
always
clutching
at
the
fruit
which
hung
from
the
tree
and
making
as
though
he
would
drink
from
the
stream
and
still
the
fruit
seemed
to
draw
back
from
his
hand
and
the
water
from
his
mouth
the
knight
seeing
him
so
tormented
asked
him
who
he
was
and
how
he
came
to
be
in
such
a
plight
i
am
tantalus
answered
the
wretch
the
most
miserable
of
all
men
in
old
time
i
feasted
with
the
gods
and
now
i
die
of
hunger
and
looking
a
little
further
he
saw
one
who
sought
to
wash
in
the
stream
hands
covered
with
filth
but
for
all
that
he
washed
they
were
not
one
whit
the
cleaner
and
when
the
knight
inquired
of
him
who
he
might
be
he
answered
i
am
pontius
pilate
most
unjust
of
judges
i
condemned
most
unrighteously
the
lord
of
life
to
die
and
washed
my
hands
to
show
that
i
was
innocent
of
his
blood
but
in
truth
i
was
most
then
mammon
coming
to
him
again
said
will
you
not
even
now
take
of
the
good
things
which
i
offer
you
for
yet
there
is
time
but
sir
guyon
was
aware
of
his
guile
and
would
not
take
me
back
he
said
to
the
place
from
which
i
came
and
mammon
was
constrained
to
obey
for
it
was
not
permitted
to
him
to
keep
the
knight
or
any
man
against
his
will
he
led
him
back
therefore
to
the
upper
air
but
as
soon
as
sir
guyon
felt
the
wind
blow
upon
his
face
for
want
of
food
and
sleep
he
fell
into
a
swoon
and
lay
without
sense
upon
the
ground
chapter
xiii
of
two
pagan
knights
while
sir
guyon
was
beholding
the
wonders
of
the
house
of
mammon
his
faithful
guide
the
pilgrim
was
seeking
him
and
came
by
happy
chance
or
leading
of
the
powers
above
to
the
place
where
he
lay
sore
troubled
he
was
to
see
him
in
so
sore
a
plight
for
indeed
he
lay
as
one
that
was
dead
nevertheless
feeling
his
pulse
with
trembling
hand
the
pilgrim
found
that
it
still
did
beat
thereat
greatly
rejoicing
he
tended
him
with
all
care
and
kindness
while
he
was
busy
with
this
tending
he
lifted
his
eyes
and
saw
two
knights
riding
towards
him
clad
in
bright
armour
and
an
old
man
pacing
by
their
side
the
two
were
brothers
pyrochles
and
cymochles
by
name
and
the
old
man
was
archimage
well
he
knew
who
they
were
for
sir
guyon
had
done
battle
with
the
two
in
the
time
past
and
had
vanquished
them
nor
did
he
doubt
that
the
old
man
for
all
his
reverend
looks
was
a
wicked
sorcerer
and
they
too
knew
who
he
was
and
that
the
knight
who
lay
upon
the
ground
was
their
whilom
adversary
sir
guyon
and
first
sir
pyrochles
cried
aloud
old
man
leave
that
dead
man
to
us
a
traitor
and
a
coward
he
was
while
he
was
yet
alive
and
now
he
lies
dishonoured
nay
sir
knight
answered
the
pilgrim
you
do
wrong
so
to
revile
the
dead
he
was
a
true
knight
and
valiant
in
the
field
as
none
know
more
surely
than
then
said
the
other
pagan
cymochles
old
man
you
dote
and
indeed
what
know
you
of
knighthood
and
valour
all
is
not
gold
that
glitters
nor
are
all
good
knights
that
know
how
to
set
spear
in
rest
and
use
the
sword
let
a
man
be
judged
by
his
end
there
he
lies
dead
on
the
field
and
the
dead
are
nothing
pyrochles
spoke
again
ay
he
is
dead
and
i
must
forego
the
vengeance
that
i
vowed
to
have
upon
him
nevertheless
what
i
can
that
will
i
have
i
will
despoil
him
of
his
arms
why
should
a
dead
body
be
arrayed
in
so
noble
a
fashion
nay
sir
knight
cried
the
pilgrim
i
pray
you
not
to
do
so
foul
a
deed
tis
a
vile
thing
to
rob
the
dead
surely
it
would
better
befit
a
noble
knight
to
leave
these
things
to
be
the
ornament
of
his
what
tomb
cried
pyrochles
in
his
rage
the
raven
and
the
kite
are
tomb
enough
for
such
as
thus
speaking
he
laid
a
rude
hand
upon
sir
guyon
s
shield
and
cymochles
began
to
unlace
his
helmet
but
while
they
were
so
busied
they
chanced
to
spy
a
knight
of
gallant
mien
and
bravely
accoutred
riding
towards
them
with
a
squire
behind
him
who
carried
a
spear
of
ebony
and
a
covered
shield
and
archimage
so
cunning
was
he
knew
him
from
afar
and
he
cried
to
the
two
brothers
rise
prepare
yourselves
for
battle
here
comes
the
sturdiest
knight
in
all
the
world
prince
arthur
many
a
pagan
has
he
laid
low
in
battle
you
must
use
all
your
skill
to
hold
your
own
against
so
the
two
made
themselves
ready
for
battle
and
now
the
strange
knight
rode
up
and
with
all
courtesy
made
his
salute
to
the
company
to
which
greeting
the
two
brothers
made
but
a
churlish
return
he
said
to
the
pilgrim
tell
me
reverend
sir
what
misfortune
has
befallen
this
knight
did
he
die
in
course
of
nature
or
by
treason
or
in
fair
fight
said
the
pilgrim
he
is
not
dead
but
in
a
swoon
that
has
the
likeness
of
then
prince
arthur
turning
to
the
two
brothers
said
with
all
courtesy
valiant
sirs
who
i
doubt
not
have
just
complaint
against
this
knight
who
lies
here
dead
or
seeming
dead
upon
the
ground
will
you
not
abate
your
wrath
awhile
i
would
not
challenge
your
right
but
would
rather
entreat
your
pardon
for
this
helpless
but
who
are
you
said
cymochles
that
make
yourself
his
daysman
who
are
you
that
would
hinder
me
from
wreaking
on
his
vile
carcase
the
vengeance
which
i
should
have
required
had
he
lived
the
man
is
dead
but
his
offence
still
it
is
but
true
said
the
prince
that
evil
lives
after
death
and
that
the
curse
goes
down
even
to
the
third
and
fourth
generation
so
stern
is
the
judgment
of
god
but
yet
the
knight
who
raises
his
hand
against
the
dead
sins
against
his
but
pyrochles
made
reply
stranger
you
make
yourself
a
sharer
in
the
dead
man
s
and
as
he
spoke
he
lifted
his
great
sword
and
dealt
a
blow
which
but
that
the
prince
s
horse
swerved
aside
had
surely
laid
him
on
the
earth
he
reeled
somewhat
in
the
saddle
but
so
true
was
his
seat
still
kept
his
place
great
was
his
wrath
at
such
treacherous
attack
traitor
he
said
you
have
broken
the
law
of
arms
so
to
strike
without
challenge
given
and
you
shall
suffer
such
penalty
as
so
speaking
he
thrust
his
spear
and
thought
with
that
one
thrust
to
end
the
battle
and
so
indeed
it
would
have
fallen
out
but
for
sir
guyon
s
shield
which
the
pagan
carried
yet
even
through
this
with
its
seven
folds
did
the
pass
and
pierced
pyrochles
shoulder
and
drove
him
bleeding
to
the
earth
when
cymochles
saw
what
had
happened
he
leapt
forward
in
great
wrath
crying
now
by
mahomet
cursed
thief
you
shall
pay
for
this
blow
and
smote
him
on
the
crest
so
mightily
that
he
had
no
chance
but
to
leave
his
saddle
else
had
his
head
been
cleft
in
twain
now
was
the
prince
in
no
small
distress
for
what
could
he
do
with
his
spear
alone
against
two
stalwart
knights
for
sword
he
had
none
and
they
too
were
both
fully
armed
and
well
skilled
in
fight
unwounded
one
and
the
other
wounded
indeed
but
only
made
thereby
more
furious
bravely
did
he
bear
himself
and
bravely
held
his
own
wounding
now
this
adversary
and
now
that
yet
did
not
himself
escape
without
hurt
for
cymochles
wounded
him
sorely
in
the
side
so
that
the
blood
flowed
out
amain
and
when
the
brothers
saw
it
they
rejoiced
greatly
thinking
that
the
end
had
come
but
now
the
pilgrim
seeing
that
the
prince
was
hard
bested
and
all
for
want
of
a
sword
came
near
and
put
sir
guyon
s
blade
into
his
hand
saying
my
son
god
bless
your
right
hand
use
the
sword
as
he
that
owns
it
would
have
used
right
glad
was
the
knight
to
have
this
help
and
advanced
himself
with
new
courage
to
his
task
he
smote
first
this
brother
and
then
that
and
both
so
fiercely
that
though
they
were
two
against
one
they
could
not
hold
their
own
but
began
to
give
way
only
the
prince
was
at
this
disadvantage
that
when
pyrochles
held
out
against
him
the
shield
of
sir
guyon
with
the
likeness
of
queen
gloriana
on
it
his
hand
retreated
and
forebore
the
stroke
once
and
again
was
the
pagan
saved
thereby
from
instant
doom
but
for
all
that
the
appointed
hour
drew
nigh
cymochles
thinking
to
end
the
battle
smote
the
prince
upon
the
hauberk
so
fierce
was
the
blow
that
it
broke
the
links
of
the
mail
in
twain
and
made
the
prince
to
reel
as
he
had
never
reeled
before
but
his
courage
rose
all
the
higher
and
his
strength
seemed
to
be
doubled
high
in
the
air
he
lifted
sir
guyon
s
sword
and
smote
the
pagan
s
helmet
so
fiercely
that
he
shore
it
in
two
and
the
steel
pierced
to
the
brain
so
that
he
fell
dying
to
the
ground
when
pyrochles
beheld
what
had
befallen
his
brother
he
was
so
filled
with
rage
that
he
cast
away
all
caution
and
care
and
rushed
in
madman
s
fashion
upon
the
prince
and
now
might
be
seen
how
an
evil
deed
finds
its
recompense
the
sword
which
the
pagan
carried
was
in
truth
the
prince
s
own
which
had
been
filched
from
him
by
craft
now
archimage
had
warned
the
knight
before
saying
use
not
this
blade
against
its
rightful
lord
it
will
not
serve
your
and
well
he
knew
that
he
spoke
the
truth
but
pyrochles
had
laughed
him
to
scorn
saying
you
think
too
much
old
man
of
magic
charms
and
yet
now
he
found
that
the
old
man
s
words
were
true
so
perceiving
that
he
smote
to
no
purpose
he
threw
the
sword
down
and
leapt
upon
the
prince
and
caught
him
round
the
middle
and
thought
to
throw
him
to
the
earth
but
he
strove
to
no
purpose
for
the
prince
surpassed
him
both
in
strength
and
in
skill
so
that
he
was
thrown
to
the
ground
whereon
he
lay
helpless
as
a
bittern
in
the
claws
of
an
eagle
full
of
rage
he
was
but
he
did
not
move
nor
cast
a
look
upon
his
conqueror
but
the
prince
full
of
courtesy
and
kindness
said
pagan
this
is
an
evil
day
for
you
but
if
you
will
give
up
your
false
faith
and
yield
yourself
to
be
my
liegeman
for
ever
i
will
give
you
life
in
reward
for
your
courage
and
blot
out
from
my
memory
all
your
fool
cried
the
pagan
in
his
rage
i
defy
your
gift
use
your
fortune
as
you
will
slay
me
for
i
would
not
live
at
your
and
the
prince
much
against
his
will
smote
him
that
he
died
and
now
sir
guyon
waking
from
his
swoon
saw
the
pilgrim
at
his
side
and
cried
out
with
joy
dear
friend
for
lack
of
whose
guidance
i
have
wandered
long
how
gladly
do
i
see
you
again
but
where
are
my
shield
and
my
sword
then
the
pilgrim
told
him
what
had
befallen
and
the
knight
rendered
his
thanks
to
the
prince
right
courteously
and
he
as
courteously
received
them
chapter
xiv
of
queen
acrasia
all
day
the
two
journeyed
together
with
much
sweet
converse
and
when
it
was
evening
they
came
to
a
fair
castle
of
which
the
gate
was
fast
barred
so
the
prince
bade
his
squire
wind
his
horn
under
the
castle
wall
which
thing
he
did
with
such
a
will
that
a
watchman
straightway
looked
forth
from
an
upper
storey
but
the
gate
was
barred
as
before
what
want
you
strangers
he
asked
we
seek
shelter
for
the
night
answered
the
squire
fly
cried
the
man
fly
my
friends
for
your
lives
willingly
would
i
give
you
shelter
but
this
is
no
safe
abiding
place
so
closely
and
fiercely
do
our
enemies
assail
us
truly
many
knights
coming
as
you
have
come
this
day
have
perished
and
while
he
was
speaking
a
thousand
villainous
creatures
swarmed
up
from
all
the
rocks
and
caves
about
armed
in
the
strangest
fashion
some
with
pikes
and
some
with
clubs
and
some
with
stakes
hardened
in
the
fire
fiercely
they
rushed
at
the
knights
and
their
company
and
for
a
while
drove
them
back
by
mere
force
of
numbers
but
soon
they
were
forced
to
fly
and
though
they
came
again
and
again
yet
before
the
night
fell
they
departed
and
left
the
travellers
in
peace
and
now
the
castle
gate
was
opened
wide
and
the
lady
of
the
place
alma
by
name
coming
to
the
door
with
a
fair
company
of
knights
and
dames
bade
them
welcome
then
she
showed
them
her
castle
which
was
marvellously
in
all
its
parts
there
was
a
noble
hall
in
which
the
there
was
already
gathered
a
goodly
company
of
knights
and
entertained
and
a
library
where
there
was
a
great
store
of
goodly
books
and
all
other
things
which
the
heart
of
man
could
desire
on
the
morrow
sir
guyon
and
his
guide
set
forth
again
but
prince
arthur
tarried
behind
desiring
to
help
the
lady
alma
against
the
enemies
who
sought
to
take
her
castle
and
this
he
did
in
such
a
fashion
that
she
was
troubled
no
more
with
them
yet
of
his
great
deeds
i
will
not
further
speak
being
rather
concerned
with
the
doings
of
sir
guyon
who
was
indeed
now
come
to
the
accomplishment
of
his
task
first
they
came
to
a
great
water
where
there
was
a
ready
prepared
for
their
coming
in
this
they
embarked
and
set
forth
a
stout
ferryman
being
at
hand
to
manage
the
craft
two
days
they
sailed
and
saw
no
land
but
on
the
third
day
as
the
light
began
to
dawn
in
the
east
they
heard
the
sound
of
a
great
roaring
now
the
pilgrim
held
the
tiller
and
steered
the
craft
to
him
said
the
ferryman
pilgrim
steer
an
even
course
there
is
a
dangerous
place
which
we
must
pass
across
the
one
side
is
a
great
whirlpool
and
a
ship
that
comes
too
near
it
is
sure
to
sink
and
on
the
other
a
great
rock
of
magnet
which
if
we
keep
not
a
due
distance
will
draw
us
to
itself
steer
then
so
that
we
may
not
fall
into
this
danger
or
into
right
skilfully
did
the
pilgrim
steer
and
great
was
the
need
the
whirlpool
indeed
showed
no
sign
of
what
had
happened
there
before
for
all
was
swallowed
up
in
its
depths
but
on
the
rock
they
saw
the
ribs
of
ships
which
had
been
broken
upon
it
and
the
bones
of
men
lying
in
its
clefts
and
birds
of
prey
mews
and
cormorants
and
the
like
sat
watching
for
such
spoils
as
should
come
right
willingly
did
they
pass
from
that
place
of
death
and
when
the
ferryman
plying
his
oars
with
sturdy
strength
had
rowed
awhile
sir
guyon
cried
pointing
with
his
hand
i
see
land
yonder
steer
thereto
good
nay
said
the
ferryman
it
is
not
so
that
is
no
land
which
you
see
but
what
men
call
the
wandering
islands
many
men
have
come
to
their
deaths
through
them
they
seem
firm
ground
fairly
grown
with
trees
and
grass
and
flowers
but
let
a
man
once
set
his
foot
upon
them
he
can
never
recover
it
so
they
journeyed
on
in
a
straight
course
and
in
so
doing
came
to
one
of
these
islands
whereon
they
espied
a
fair
lady
sitting
on
the
rock
she
sat
and
she
had
a
little
boat
hard
by
come
hither
my
friends
she
said
i
have
somewhat
here
which
i
would
show
you
and
which
you
would
willingly
but
sir
guyon
said
nay
nay
we
are
otherwise
minded
this
is
the
lady
of
the
lake
who
caused
me
to
be
parted
from
my
so
they
passed
on
and
took
no
heed
but
when
after
a
while
they
passed
hard
by
another
island
on
which
sat
a
maiden
in
sore
distress
as
it
seemed
sir
guyon
s
heart
was
moved
for
was
it
not
a
good
knight
s
part
to
succour
ladies
in
distress
steer
thither
he
cried
not
so
this
damsel
in
distress
is
but
a
show
no
damsel
she
but
some
ill
creature
ready
to
devour
any
that
she
may
so
they
passed
on
nor
did
they
halt
when
passing
by
a
pleasant
bay
they
heard
a
sound
of
sweet
singing
o
guyon
such
was
the
song
which
they
heard
flower
of
chivalry
most
famous
of
all
knights
upon
earth
turn
thy
bark
hither
and
rest
listen
not
said
the
pilgrim
they
do
but
seek
to
lure
you
to
your
these
things
past
they
came
to
the
place
for
which
they
were
bound
and
the
pilgrim
said
this
sir
knight
is
the
place
where
you
must
contend
for
the
mastery
take
your
arms
and
make
yourself
ready
for
the
hour
of
trial
is
at
and
now
the
ferryman
drove
the
boat
upon
the
shore
and
sir
guyon
and
his
guide
stepped
out
upon
the
sand
straightway
they
heard
a
hideous
bellowing
as
of
savage
beasts
and
soon
the
beasts
themselves
came
in
view
threatening
as
if
they
would
devour
them
but
no
sooner
did
the
pilgrim
hold
out
his
staff
than
they
ceased
their
roaring
and
humbled
themselves
to
the
ground
and
now
they
came
to
the
bower
of
bliss
a
place
most
daintily
adorned
with
all
that
could
please
the
eye
the
porch
by
which
they
entered
was
of
ivory
cunningly
adorned
with
carved
work
in
which
was
told
the
story
of
jason
and
medea
how
he
sailed
in
the
good
ship
and
how
he
won
the
love
of
the
king
s
daughter
and
how
she
helped
him
to
win
the
fleece
of
gold
from
the
dragon
which
guarded
it
and
how
she
fled
with
him
over
the
sea
and
when
they
had
passed
through
the
porch
they
came
to
a
very
fair
meadow
adorned
with
the
fairest
trees
and
flowers
and
the
meadow
being
passed
they
came
to
another
gate
where
there
sat
a
comely
damsel
who
pressed
the
clusters
of
a
vine
which
hung
above
her
head
into
a
cup
this
cup
she
proffered
to
the
knight
and
he
suspecting
evil
in
all
that
seemed
most
fair
and
pleasant
took
it
from
her
hand
and
threw
it
violently
on
the
ground
so
that
it
was
broken
into
many
pieces
and
all
the
liquor
was
spilt
illustration
sir
guyon
and
the
men
in
bestial
shapes
many
other
tempting
sights
did
they
see
and
all
the
knight
passed
by
unscathed
the
pilgrim
not
ceasing
on
occasion
to
give
counsel
and
warning
so
at
last
they
came
to
the
most
sacred
place
of
the
bower
where
the
queen
herself
acrasia
by
name
had
her
abode
fair
she
was
beyond
all
words
and
daintily
arrayed
and
at
her
feet
there
lay
a
goodly
knight
asleep
he
was
of
goodly
aspect
just
come
to
the
years
of
manhood
with
the
down
newly
sprung
upon
his
cheeks
and
his
lips
his
arms
hung
idly
on
a
tree
hard
by
but
his
shield
was
without
an
emblem
as
if
he
had
put
away
the
purpose
of
his
life
sir
guyon
and
the
pilgrim
drew
near
none
seeming
to
heed
them
so
occupied
were
they
with
the
pleasures
of
the
place
and
then
the
pilgrim
threw
over
the
queen
and
the
knight
a
net
which
he
had
cunningly
prepared
for
that
same
purpose
fast
did
it
hold
them
for
all
their
struggles
neither
force
nor
art
could
avail
them
though
they
strove
with
all
their
might
the
queen
being
thus
captured
they
bound
her
with
chains
of
adamant
for
nothing
else
could
hold
her
safely
but
the
knight
they
soon
set
free
for
he
was
of
a
noble
nature
though
it
was
much
decayed
by
evil
ways
and
he
was
willing
to
take
to
himself
good
advice
and
counsel
and
the
beauty
and
glory
of
the
bower
did
they
deface
and
spoil
the
goodly
carvings
they
broke
in
pieces
and
cut
down
the
pleasant
groves
as
for
the
beasts
when
the
pilgrim
raised
his
staff
over
them
they
left
their
bestial
shapes
and
came
back
to
their
own
for
indeed
they
were
men
whom
this
same
evil
queen
had
changed
to
the
forms
and
thoughts
of
beasts
so
did
sir
guyon
perform
the
command
of
queen
gloriana
chapter
xv
britomart
sir
guyon
returned
to
rest
awhile
in
the
castle
of
the
lady
alma
where
also
he
had
prince
arthur
for
companion
acrasia
he
sent
to
queen
gloriana
under
a
strong
guard
lest
perchance
her
friends
and
followers
of
whom
there
was
great
multitude
should
seek
to
deliver
her
after
a
while
the
two
knights
set
out
again
on
their
journey
many
good
deeds
they
did
helping
the
weak
and
setting
right
the
things
that
were
wrong
it
happened
on
a
certain
day
that
they
espied
a
knight
riding
towards
them
with
an
aged
squire
by
his
side
who
seemed
too
weak
for
the
burden
which
he
bare
the
knight
had
a
shield
with
the
device
of
a
lion
on
a
field
of
gold
sir
guyon
said
to
prince
arthur
let
me
i
pray
you
have
this
so
he
put
his
spear
to
rest
and
charged
and
the
stranger
did
likewise
they
met
full
and
fair
sir
guyon
s
spear
so
fast
and
furious
was
the
onset
was
like
to
pierce
the
stranger
s
shield
but
this
it
did
not
avail
to
do
nor
did
it
drive
the
stranger
from
his
seat
nevertheless
he
was
somewhat
shaken
on
the
other
hand
sir
guyon
himself
was
carried
back
ere
he
was
aware
nigh
upon
a
spear
s
length
behind
the
crupper
of
his
saddle
yet
without
hurt
to
life
or
limb
nevertheless
his
anger
was
great
for
never
since
the
day
when
he
first
bore
arms
as
a
knight
had
he
been
dismounted
in
such
fashion
and
indeed
if
he
had
known
the
whole
truth
of
the
matter
his
anger
had
been
both
less
and
greater
less
because
the
spear
by
which
he
had
been
overthrown
was
of
the
magic
sort
and
greater
because
the
knight
by
whom
he
had
been
overthrown
was
no
man
but
a
maid
even
the
famous
britomart
full
of
rage
he
was
and
hot
to
do
away
his
disgrace
as
leaping
from
the
ground
he
drew
his
sword
and
now
the
pilgrim
in
great
haste
came
between
the
knight
and
his
purpose
for
being
a
holy
man
and
wise
he
perceived
that
there
was
some
marvellous
power
in
that
same
this
indeed
he
did
not
disclose
for
it
was
not
lawful
so
to
do
but
he
made
other
pretence
nay
sir
knight
it
were
ill
advised
to
seek
amends
with
your
sword
for
the
mischance
of
your
spear
if
haply
your
steed
swerved
somewhat
to
the
side
or
your
page
was
somewhat
careless
in
the
ordering
of
your
equipage
why
should
you
be
so
carried
away
by
wrath
for
remember
you
have
no
quarrel
with
this
with
such
prudent
counsels
did
the
pilgrim
pacify
sir
guyon
s
wrath
thus
concord
was
made
between
the
two
in
which
the
prince
also
was
joined
when
they
had
journeyed
awhile
prince
arthur
and
sir
guyon
set
off
on
an
adventure
of
their
own
to
rescue
some
fair
lady
in
distress
but
britomart
finding
that
they
two
would
suffice
for
that
enterprise
on
which
her
own
mind
was
in
nowise
set
rode
on
without
company
until
she
came
to
a
fair
castle
with
a
meadow
before
the
gate
on
which
she
saw
six
knights
setting
upon
one
he
was
not
a
little
pressed
by
such
odds
yet
in
nowise
dismayed
indeed
the
six
dared
not
to
stand
up
against
him
face
to
face
so
shrewd
were
the
blows
which
he
dealt
them
but
sought
to
take
him
at
a
disadvantage
from
behind
britomart
endured
not
to
see
such
knavish
work
but
setting
spurs
to
her
horse
and
crying
aloud
have
done
with
such
foul
tricks
made
all
haste
to
help
and
when
they
ceased
awhile
from
the
attack
she
said
to
the
single
knight
how
comes
it
sir
that
you
do
battle
in
such
fashion
and
at
such
odds
sir
he
made
answer
these
six
would
have
me
swear
that
the
lady
of
this
castle
hard
by
is
fairer
than
the
lady
whom
i
love
now
that
i
utterly
refuse
i
had
sooner
die
than
break
my
plighted
word
in
such
a
then
said
one
of
the
six
speaking
for
his
fellows
in
this
castle
which
you
see
there
dwells
a
lady
of
such
a
beauty
that
none
in
all
the
world
can
be
compared
with
her
she
has
ordained
this
law
that
any
knight
coming
to
this
place
if
he
have
no
already
shall
vow
himself
to
her
service
but
if
he
have
such
a
then
he
shall
confess
that
she
is
of
less
grace
and
beauty
or
failing
so
to
do
shall
do
battle
with
by
heaven
cried
britomart
this
is
a
hard
choice
and
tell
me
pray
if
this
knight
be
obedient
to
this
same
law
what
reward
shall
he
have
he
shall
have
the
lady
s
fair
regard
but
tell
us
sir
for
you
a
that
said
britomart
i
answer
not
whether
i
have
such
or
have
not
i
pay
no
such
homage
as
you
ask
to
your
lady
rather
i
take
up
this
good
knight
s
cause
against
and
even
while
she
spoke
she
rode
at
one
of
the
six
and
laid
him
low
upon
the
ground
and
then
at
another
and
then
again
at
a
third
with
the
like
end
meanwhile
the
knight
had
discomfited
the
fourth
and
the
two
that
were
left
were
fain
to
sue
for
peace
see
said
britomart
how
truth
and
honour
prevail
then
was
britomart
taken
into
the
castle
and
received
with
great
honour
yet
she
misliked
the
place
and
the
company
for
that
they
both
seemed
unduly
given
over
to
ease
and
luxury
nor
would
she
doff
her
armour
nor
indeed
do
aught
but
raise
the
visor
of
her
helmet
and
when
the
lady
of
the
place
seeing
that
the
stranger
was
very
fair
and
of
a
noble
presence
bore
herself
as
one
greatly
enamoured
she
departed
in
great
discontent
the
six
knights
would
fain
have
stopped
her
going
and
one
of
them
gardanté
by
name
shooting
with
an
arrow
for
to
come
to
closer
quarters
was
not
to
his
mind
wounded
her
in
the
side
but
he
and
his
companions
received
manifold
more
hurt
than
they
gave
not
only
from
britomart
but
from
the
strange
knight
and
sir
guyon
also
for
they
hearing
the
tumult
came
to
her
help
as
they
journeyed
it
came
into
sir
guyon
s
mind
to
inquire
of
his
companion
concerning
her
condition
and
how
she
came
to
be
wandering
in
these
parts
britomart
was
not
a
little
disturbed
by
this
questioning
for
a
while
she
was
silent
and
could
make
no
answer
but
trembled
and
blushed
no
knight
but
a
very
woman
but
when
the
passion
had
passed
and
she
had
gathered
her
strength
together
she
said
sir
knight
i
would
have
you
know
that
from
a
child
i
have
been
trained
in
things
of
war
to
carry
a
shield
and
to
put
spear
in
rest
that
the
life
of
ease
which
women
for
the
most
part
follow
pleased
me
not
and
as
for
fingering
the
fine
needle
and
the
slender
thread
by
heaven
i
had
sooner
be
struck
dead
by
a
foeman
s
spear
and
so
all
my
heart
being
set
on
deeds
of
arms
and
perilous
adventures
by
sea
and
by
land
wheresoever
they
might
be
met
i
came
from
my
own
country
which
men
call
the
greater
britain
into
this
land
for
it
was
told
me
that
in
this
same
fairy
land
many
such
adventures
were
to
be
found
and
much
glory
and
honour
won
thereupon
and
now
courteous
sir
i
would
ask
you
one
question
know
you
perchance
of
one
artegall
for
he
has
done
me
a
wrong
for
which
i
would
fain
requite
him
scarcely
had
she
spoken
the
words
when
she
fain
would
have
called
them
back
but
sir
guyon
taking
them
up
with
no
small
heat
made
answer
fair
warrior
surely
you
do
ill
to
accuse
so
true
and
loyal
a
knight
as
is
sir
artegall
with
truly
of
all
who
have
ever
taken
part
in
tilt
or
tourney
there
is
not
one
that
stands
in
better
repute
than
he
it
were
indeed
the
greatest
of
marvels
that
he
should
do
an
unworthy
act
or
even
think
in
his
heart
an
unworthy
thought
and
if
you
have
come
with
such
a
purpose
in
your
heart
then
i
say
that
you
have
journeyed
far
on
a
false
now
britomart
in
her
secret
heart
was
glad
to
hear
such
praises
of
sir
artegall
for
indeed
as
will
be
seen
she
loved
him
and
it
was
her
woman
s
craft
by
speaking
ill
of
him
to
his
friends
so
to
call
forth
his
praises
and
when
with
this
thought
in
her
heart
she
had
again
uttered
some
injurious
words
concerning
him
sir
guyon
answered
it
would
be
well
lady
that
you
should
listen
to
reason
in
this
matter
truly
he
is
not
one
whom
you
can
compel
by
force
to
do
this
thing
or
that
for
there
is
not
i
take
it
a
knight
upon
earth
that
can
match
him
in
equal
fight
and
indeed
for
what
you
ask
me
where
is
sir
artegall
to
be
found
i
can
not
tell
you
he
is
not
one
who
will
remain
for
long
time
in
any
certain
place
rather
he
wanders
round
the
world
seeking
occasion
for
great
deeds
by
which
he
can
help
to
right
such
as
suffer
britomart
was
greatly
pleased
to
hear
such
praises
of
the
knight
still
she
dissembled
the
matter
and
said
whether
it
be
easy
or
hard
to
find
the
man
i
know
not
but
at
least
i
would
know
how
i
may
profitably
seek
him
tell
me
some
mark
by
which
i
may
know
him
the
manner
of
his
shield
the
fashion
of
his
arms
the
bearing
of
his
steed
and
other
things
by
which
i
may
certainly
know
the
man
should
i
chance
to
encounter
then
sir
guyon
told
her
all
that
she
would
know
and
she
listening
to
all
that
he
said
found
it
most
welcome
to
her
heart
chapter
xvi
of
merlin
s
magic
mirror
there
was
a
certain
king
of
old
time
in
the
land
of
deheubarth
which
men
now
call
south
wales
his
name
was
ryence
and
he
had
for
his
principal
counsellor
one
merlin
who
was
a
great
magician
this
merlin
made
by
his
art
a
wonderful
mirror
which
was
so
contrived
that
he
who
looked
in
it
could
see
anything
from
the
lowest
parts
of
the
earth
to
the
highest
part
of
the
heavens
if
only
it
concerned
him
if
a
foe
contrived
any
evil
against
him
if
a
friend
had
used
any
falsehood
in
respect
of
him
there
he
could
see
it
plainly
set
forth
this
mirror
merlin
gave
to
the
king
for
a
protection
that
if
at
any
time
an
enemy
should
invade
his
dominions
he
should
know
of
his
design
before
tidings
could
come
to
him
from
without
and
so
should
be
able
to
be
beforehand
with
him
never
had
prince
a
more
noble
present
nor
one
more
worthy
of
reward
for
there
could
be
no
treason
within
the
realm
or
enmity
without
but
that
it
came
straightway
to
the
king
s
knowledge
now
britomart
was
the
daughter
of
king
ryence
and
it
chanced
on
a
certain
day
that
she
came
into
his
closet
for
he
kept
nothing
secret
from
her
seeing
that
she
was
his
only
child
and
the
heir
of
his
kingdom
and
there
saw
merlin
s
mirror
she
had
seen
it
indeed
not
once
or
twice
only
and
knew
its
virtues
there
came
into
her
head
the
thought
that
she
might
see
therein
the
image
of
the
man
who
should
be
her
husband
such
a
thought
maidens
are
wont
to
entertain
and
britomart
being
her
father
s
only
child
and
knowing
that
she
would
one
day
come
to
the
kingdom
was
the
more
curious
in
this
regard
nor
had
she
had
to
that
time
any
thought
of
one
man
more
than
of
another
so
looking
into
the
mirror
she
saw
a
very
comely
knight
armed
he
had
the
visor
of
his
helmet
up
showing
a
face
that
would
strike
fear
into
an
enemy
and
be
loving
to
a
friend
he
was
tall
of
stature
and
bore
himself
with
a
manly
grace
for
his
crest
he
had
a
hound
couchant
and
his
armour
seemed
of
ancient
fashion
massive
and
strong
to
look
at
on
it
was
written
in
old
letters
these
words
the
arms
of
achilles
which
artegall
did
the
shield
was
of
seven
folds
and
it
bore
an
ermilin
crowned
white
on
a
field
of
blue
the
maiden
looked
and
liked
well
what
she
saw
and
went
her
way
not
was
the
simplicity
of
her
she
had
seen
with
her
eyes
the
fate
that
should
rule
the
fortunes
of
her
life
that
keen
archer
love
had
wounded
her
with
his
arrow
but
she
knew
it
not
yet
from
that
day
she
began
to
droop
no
longer
did
she
carry
herself
with
princely
pride
sad
and
solemn
was
she
and
full
of
fancies
yet
knew
not
why
that
she
ailed
somewhat
she
was
well
aware
but
thought
it
was
not
love
but
some
passing
mood
of
melancholy
such
was
she
by
day
and
at
night
when
she
laid
herself
down
to
rest
sleep
fled
far
from
her
eyes
she
kept
a
sorrowful
watch
as
the
hours
of
the
night
went
by
and
she
watered
her
couch
with
her
tears
and
if
when
nature
was
worn
out
with
these
long
watchings
she
fell
into
some
brief
slumber
then
some
fearful
dreams
would
come
and
bring
with
them
a
worse
unrest
one
night
her
nurse
glaucé
by
name
caught
her
in
her
arms
as
she
was
leaping
from
her
bed
and
held
her
down
by
force
ah
my
child
she
cried
how
is
it
that
you
are
in
this
evil
plight
what
is
it
that
has
changed
your
cheerful
mood
to
this
sadness
surely
there
is
some
cause
for
these
troubles
that
haunt
you
by
night
and
drive
away
sleep
from
your
eyes
and
in
the
days
when
your
equals
in
age
disport
themselves
you
mope
in
solitary
corners
and
have
no
enjoyment
of
your
princely
life
i
doubt
much
whether
the
cause
be
not
love
yet
if
the
love
be
worthy
of
your
race
and
royal
that
it
is
i
seem
to
myself
to
read
by
many
signs
and
i
do
swear
most
solemnly
to
help
you
away
dear
child
with
your
fears
neither
danger
or
death
shall
keep
me
from
bringing
you
due
then
she
caught
the
maid
in
her
arms
and
embraced
her
in
all
tenderness
and
chafed
her
limbs
to
drive
away
the
cold
and
kissed
her
eyes
still
entreating
that
she
should
show
the
secret
of
her
heart
for
a
while
the
maid
was
silent
then
she
said
dear
nurse
why
should
you
grieve
for
me
is
it
not
enough
that
i
must
die
must
you
die
also
talk
not
of
dying
cried
the
nurse
never
was
wound
yet
for
which
no
salve
could
be
found
the
god
who
has
wounded
you
has
i
doubt
not
in
his
quiver
another
arrow
for
your
lover
s
so
they
talked
together
the
maid
would
have
it
that
there
was
no
remedy
for
her
trouble
the
old
nurse
still
steadfastly
affirmed
that
the
cure
could
easily
be
found
at
last
the
damsel
told
the
secret
of
her
grief
as
it
seemed
to
her
alas
dear
mother
she
said
it
is
no
living
man
whose
image
dwells
in
my
heart
and
makes
this
pain
it
is
but
the
shadow
and
semblance
of
a
knight
i
saw
him
one
day
in
the
magic
mirror
of
the
king
my
father
this
is
the
baited
hook
which
as
some
foolish
fish
i
swallowed
it
is
this
thought
that
brings
me
to
my
is
this
all
my
daughter
cried
the
nurse
then
is
nothing
strange
or
against
nature
here
why
should
you
not
set
your
heart
on
one
who
seemed
so
worthy
of
your
love
oh
mother
answered
the
girl
i
seemed
to
myself
like
the
greek
boy
of
old
who
saw
his
own
face
in
the
fountain
and
perished
nay
cried
the
nurse
he
was
but
the
lover
of
a
shadow
and
rightly
faded
into
a
flower
but
of
this
image
which
you
saw
there
is
be
sure
a
substance
somewhere
and
there
are
arts
by
which
it
may
be
found
and
now
dear
child
let
me
give
you
my
counsel
if
you
can
banish
this
thought
from
your
mind
till
the
convenient
time
be
come
then
do
so
if
it
is
too
strong
for
you
then
i
vow
and
promise
that
by
one
means
or
another
i
will
find
this
very
knight
whose
image
you
the
maid
was
somewhat
encouraged
by
these
words
and
slept
awhile
but
on
the
morrow
and
as
the
days
went
by
the
old
trouble
came
again
and
glaucé
seeing
that
neither
words
nor
prayers
nor
strange
spells
of
the
magic
art
for
such
she
tried
were
of
any
avail
judged
that
some
other
remedy
must
needs
be
found
what
this
remedy
might
be
she
long
doubted
in
herself
at
last
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
who
had
made
the
mirror
that
is
to
say
the
wise
magician
merlin
might
tell
her
in
what
land
the
knight
of
the
image
might
dwell
for
though
he
dwelt
in
farthest
ind
yet
find
him
she
would
forthwith
these
two
that
is
to
say
glaucé
and
the
maiden
britomart
disguised
themselves
in
mean
attire
that
no
one
might
learn
their
purpose
and
betook
themselves
to
maridunum
where
in
a
cave
which
he
had
hollowed
out
for
himself
beneath
the
earth
so
as
to
escape
from
the
curious
eyes
of
men
merlin
had
his
abode
when
they
were
come
to
the
place
they
stood
awhile
without
in
doubt
and
fear
whether
they
had
done
well
in
making
so
bold
a
venture
at
last
the
maid
moved
by
love
which
is
ever
bold
led
the
way
and
glaucé
following
they
stood
within
the
cave
there
they
found
the
magician
busy
on
some
wonderful
work
for
he
was
writing
strange
characters
on
the
ground
the
spells
by
which
he
bound
the
spirits
of
the
earth
to
his
service
he
was
not
one
whit
moved
at
their
coming
of
which
indeed
he
was
aware
beforehand
for
indeed
by
his
art
he
knew
the
secret
thoughts
of
others
nevertheless
he
made
as
though
he
knew
not
their
errand
saying
tell
me
now
on
what
business
you
are
come
then
glaucé
answered
blame
us
not
kind
sir
that
we
have
thus
disturbed
you
in
your
solitude
coming
thus
unbidden
but
the
need
was
speak
on
said
merlin
then
she
began
three
months
have
passed
since
this
maiden
here
began
to
sicken
of
some
strange
disease
what
it
is
and
whence
it
began
i
know
not
only
this
i
know
that
unless
you
can
find
some
remedy
she
must
shortly
the
magician
smiled
at
her
woman
s
craft
knowing
well
that
she
had
in
her
heart
that
which
she
would
not
tell
madam
he
said
i
take
it
from
what
you
say
that
this
damsel
has
more
need
of
the
physician
s
art
than
of
any
skill
of
mine
they
who
may
find
a
remedy
for
their
trouble
elsewhere
do
ill
to
have
recourse
to
the
magic
the
old
dame
was
not
a
little
disturbed
by
these
words
but
yet
was
loath
to
show
her
true
purpose
sir
she
said
the
trouble
has
taken
too
strong
a
hold
on
this
maiden
s
life
that
the
physician
s
art
could
work
a
cure
i
fear
me
much
that
some
bad
spell
has
been
cast
upon
her
some
witch
or
evil
spirit
has
done
this
thing
therefore
it
is
that
we
seek
your
when
he
heard
these
words
merlin
could
no
more
contain
himself
but
laughed
aloud
glaucé
he
said
what
avails
this
pretence
by
which
you
seek
to
hide
your
purpose
and
you
fair
britomart
why
have
you
thus
disguised
yourself
in
mean
attire
as
the
sun
hides
himself
behind
a
cloud
you
have
come
by
the
ordering
of
fate
to
the
very
place
where
you
shall
find
the
help
which
you
the
maiden
hearing
her
name
so
called
blushed
a
rosy
red
but
the
nurse
not
one
whit
dismayed
but
rather
taking
heart
at
merlin
s
words
said
sir
if
you
know
our
troubles
and
indeed
what
is
there
that
you
do
not
know
have
pity
upon
us
and
help
us
in
our
merlin
sat
silent
awhile
for
many
thoughts
were
in
his
mind
at
last
he
spoke
most
noble
maid
who
have
learned
to
love
in
this
strange
fashion
be
not
dismayed
by
this
hard
beginning
of
your
life
it
was
no
chance
look
o
britomart
in
the
mirror
of
the
king
your
father
but
the
unchanging
course
of
the
purposes
of
heaven
that
showed
you
this
image
believe
me
it
is
no
that
you
love
this
noble
knight
submit
yourself
therefore
to
the
purposes
of
god
and
be
content
to
do
his
then
said
glaucé
tell
us
man
of
wisdom
what
means
she
shall
use
what
ways
she
shall
take
to
find
this
man
or
has
she
no
need
of
toil
but
may
sit
still
while
her
fate
is
fashioned
for
her
the
fates
answered
merlin
are
firmly
fixed
not
the
less
it
becomes
those
whom
they
concern
to
do
their
own
endeavour
and
to
be
with
then
he
told
britomart
the
true
name
and
lineage
of
sir
artegall
how
that
he
was
son
to
gorloïs
king
of
cornwall
in
time
past
and
brother
to
cador
then
king
of
the
same
land
then
he
turned
to
britomart
and
opened
to
her
the
future
how
she
should
be
wife
to
sir
artegall
and
how
from
them
would
come
a
line
of
kings
who
should
reign
with
great
glory
many
things
that
should
come
to
pass
in
after
days
both
good
and
evil
did
merlin
unfold
to
her
chapter
xvii
how
britomart
took
to
arms
from
merlin
s
cave
these
two
britomart
and
glaucé
her
nurse
went
back
to
their
own
home
there
they
consulted
together
many
days
how
they
might
best
carry
out
their
purpose
of
seeking
sir
artegall
at
last
glaucé
said
my
daughter
i
have
conceived
in
my
heart
a
scheme
somewhat
bold
i
must
confess
yet
such
as
may
be
accomplished
if
you
are
both
brave
and
prudent
and
above
all
things
it
is
in
good
accord
with
the
conditions
of
these
present
days
you
must
know
that
the
good
king
uther
has
of
late
made
war
against
the
pagan
brothers
octa
and
oza
who
are
newly
come
to
this
country
from
the
lands
which
lie
about
the
northern
sea
and
has
won
a
great
victory
over
them
and
their
people
and
that
all
britain
is
now
in
a
great
flame
of
war
my
counsel
therefore
is
seeing
that
armed
men
are
everywhere
let
us
make
ourselves
as
armed
men
let
our
hands
weak
though
they
be
by
nature
learn
to
handle
the
spear
and
the
sword
nor
shall
we
fail
therein
for
there
are
no
scholars
so
apt
as
they
who
have
need
for
their
teacher
and
indeed
my
daughter
you
are
one
who
should
easily
learn
such
matters
for
you
are
both
tall
and
strong
and
need
practice
only
which
being
had
you
should
be
as
truly
martial
a
maid
as
you
could
wish
nor
is
such
a
thing
unknown
in
the
race
from
which
you
come
such
was
the
bold
boadicea
who
reigned
in
old
time
over
the
iceni
for
she
made
haughty
rome
to
tremble
before
her
and
others
as
gwendolen
and
emmilen
hear
also
this
thing
which
i
saw
with
my
own
eyes
on
the
battlefield
at
menevia
where
king
uther
last
fought
against
the
pagan
hosts
there
was
a
saxon
virgin
who
thrice
struck
to
the
earth
the
great
ulfin
himself
verily
she
had
slain
him
as
he
lay
but
that
caradoc
held
her
hand
and
caradoc
himself
had
much
ado
to
escape
from
her
without
tell
me
i
pray
you
her
name
said
britomart
they
call
her
angela
the
nurse
made
answer
and
she
is
as
fair
as
she
is
strong
she
is
the
leader
of
a
tribe
who
are
more
to
be
feared
than
all
other
saxons
they
call
themselves
much
was
the
maiden
moved
by
this
tale
so
that
she
made
her
resolve
unknown
to
her
father
to
take
upon
herself
all
the
duties
and
adventures
which
were
fitting
to
a
knight
and
she
said
to
her
nurse
see
glaucé
that
you
have
all
things
ready
that
are
convenient
to
my
new
and
this
glaucé
did
with
all
readiness
and
care
fortune
also
helped
in
the
matter
for
about
this
time
a
band
of
britons
being
abroad
on
a
foray
took
a
great
spoil
of
saxon
goods
and
among
them
goodly
armour
decked
with
gold
and
arms
of
proof
which
belonged
to
the
saxon
queen
angela
these
spoils
king
ryence
commanded
to
be
hung
up
in
the
chapel
of
his
palace
that
they
might
be
a
memorial
for
all
time
of
the
great
victory
which
god
had
given
to
his
arms
into
this
same
chapel
glaucé
led
the
maiden
britomart
late
in
the
night
when
no
one
was
near
and
taking
down
the
armour
clad
her
in
it
and
she
gave
her
the
arms
also
chief
among
these
being
a
wonderful
spear
which
king
bladud
had
made
by
magical
arts
many
years
before
this
virtue
it
had
that
whosoever
might
be
struck
by
the
point
thereof
could
not
stay
in
his
saddle
but
must
be
borne
to
the
ground
and
when
glaucé
had
so
furnished
the
maiden
with
due
equipment
of
war
then
she
took
for
herself
such
arms
and
armour
as
befitted
a
squire
and
put
them
on
this
done
they
left
the
place
by
secret
ways
unseen
of
any
thus
did
it
happen
that
britomart
came
in
guise
of
a
knight
into
the
company
of
sir
guyon
and
the
knight
not
long
after
this
they
parted
from
each
other
for
the
knight
had
an
errand
of
his
own
and
britomart
was
bent
on
the
finding
of
sir
artegall
many
miles
did
she
ride
and
through
many
lands
did
she
travel
till
at
last
she
came
to
the
shore
of
the
sea
there
she
lighted
from
off
her
horse
and
bade
glaucé
unlace
her
helmet
and
sat
down
upon
a
rock
to
rest
awhile
and
refresh
herself
with
the
breeze
that
blew
from
off
the
waves
and
as
she
sat
she
thought
within
herself
ah
me
how
like
is
love
to
this
restless
sea
how
shall
my
frail
bark
escape
where
there
are
so
many
dangers
and
no
certain
guide
so
she
spake
to
herself
sighing
the
while
weep
she
would
not
for
tears
she
thought
did
not
become
a
knight
but
glaucé
comforted
her
calling
to
her
mind
what
merlin
had
prophesied
about
the
things
to
come
nor
were
these
words
in
vain
but
there
soon
befell
a
thing
which
roused
her
more
than
many
words
she
spied
a
knight
in
shining
armour
riding
towards
her
in
all
haste
with
his
spear
in
rest
as
one
that
had
some
hostile
purpose
quickly
she
mounted
her
horse
and
bade
glaucé
lace
her
helmet
and
addressed
herself
without
delay
to
battle
now
by
the
time
she
had
put
her
shield
in
place
and
made
ready
her
spear
the
knight
was
close
at
hand
sir
knight
said
he
know
you
that
you
travel
on
this
road
against
my
strict
commands
i
suffer
not
any
to
pass
by
this
way
others
who
have
so
trespassed
have
come
by
their
death
therefore
i
counsel
you
to
go
back
while
there
is
yet
she
made
answer
in
few
words
let
them
fly
who
have
need
for
flight
you
may
frighten
children
with
your
words
as
for
passing
by
this
way
i
am
prepared
to
do
it
even
without
your
leave
verily
i
will
pass
or
scarcely
had
she
spoken
when
the
stranger
knight
rode
at
her
with
his
spear
in
rest
he
smote
her
full
on
the
breast
and
she
bowed
her
head
so
fierce
was
the
stroke
till
it
touched
the
crupper
of
her
saddle
but
her
was
deadlier
by
far
the
passed
through
his
shield
and
through
his
cuirass
and
glancing
thence
pierced
his
left
side
the
power
of
the
stroke
bore
him
from
the
saddle
and
laid
him
bleeding
on
the
ground
where
he
lay
wallowing
in
his
blood
so
fell
the
knight
sir
marinell
upon
the
shore
which
he
called
his
own
and
britomart
rode
on
and
as
she
went
she
saw
pearls
and
precious
stones
of
every
kind
and
ingots
of
gold
half
buried
in
the
sand
much
she
wondered
to
see
such
riches
but
she
would
not
descend
for
a
single
hour
what
were
jewels
or
precious
stones
or
gold
to
her
that
they
should
hinder
her
in
her
quest
the
story
of
sir
marinell
briefly
told
is
this
his
mother
was
a
daughter
of
nereus
god
of
the
sea
and
his
father
a
mortal
man
he
was
reared
up
in
arms
and
became
a
great
and
famous
knight
and
he
had
for
his
possession
this
same
shore
a
place
in
which
nature
of
her
own
will
had
set
much
riches
pearls
and
precious
stones
and
the
like
and
to
which
by
the
ordering
of
nereus
great
store
of
the
treasure
which
the
sea
swallows
up
through
shipwreck
was
brought
for
his
daughter
made
request
of
the
same
for
her
son
this
coast
then
he
most
jealously
guarded
against
all
comers
and
being
as
has
been
said
valiant
and
strong
and
expert
in
arms
and
also
because
he
knew
the
place
and
was
able
to
take
a
unawares
he
seemed
to
be
invincible
many
knights
seeking
to
pass
along
the
coast
for
indeed
the
fame
of
its
treasures
was
spread
abroad
were
slain
and
yet
more
being
vanquished
in
battle
for
life
s
sake
submitted
themselves
to
him
and
became
vassals
and
servants
to
him
one
hundred
knights
men
of
name
all
of
them
were
so
bound
to
his
service
in
the
end
sir
marinell
what
with
the
multitude
of
his
riches
and
the
pride
of
having
so
many
knights
of
renown
at
his
beck
and
call
became
not
a
little
puffed
up
and
his
mother
knowing
that
the
wise
man
had
said
of
old
pride
goeth
before
a
fall
would
fain
know
how
he
might
be
kept
from
mischief
so
she
went
to
a
certain
god
of
the
sea
proteus
by
name
who
had
the
gift
of
foretelling
things
to
come
and
proteus
said
to
her
my
daughter
keep
this
thy
son
from
all
womankind
for
from
a
woman
he
shall
have
a
deadly
and
the
mother
taking
these
words
to
be
spoken
of
woman
s
love
set
her
son
s
mind
against
all
such
things
and
did
most
carefully
keep
him
from
all
company
of
women
and
he
to
do
her
pleasure
obeyed
her
in
this
matter
yet
could
not
so
escape
his
fate
and
this
fate
was
all
the
harder
because
this
knight
was
beloved
of
a
fair
and
virtuous
maiden
florimell
by
name
whom
he
might
have
wedded
much
to
his
joy
and
profit
of
this
same
florimell
more
shall
be
told
hereafter
britomart
after
having
thus
vanquished
sir
marinell
still
went
on
her
quest
and
came
at
night
to
the
castle
of
a
certain
malbecco
to
this
same
place
there
had
also
come
earlier
by
the
space
of
an
hour
or
so
two
other
knights
sir
paridell
and
sir
satyrane
it
was
this
same
satyrane
that
helped
the
lady
una
in
her
wanderings
when
she
was
parted
by
evil
chance
from
the
knight
to
them
sir
paridell
s
squire
had
said
my
lords
you
will
not
find
entertainment
here
the
master
of
this
castle
malbecco
by
name
is
a
mere
churl
and
hates
all
company
and
this
for
two
reasons
the
first
of
these
reasons
is
that
his
mind
is
wholly
set
on
riches
and
he
hates
all
doings
by
which
they
may
seem
to
be
wasted
and
the
second
is
that
he
being
old
and
crabbed
is
wedded
to
a
very
fair
young
wife
whom
he
would
fain
keep
from
the
sight
of
all
eyes
but
his
own
verily
he
keeps
her
as
in
when
sir
paridell
heard
the
squire
s
story
he
said
why
do
we
suffer
this
old
dotard
to
behave
himself
in
this
churlish
fashion
twere
better
to
kill
the
villain
and
spoil
his
nay
said
sir
satyrane
who
was
a
loyal
and
true
knight
and
would
fain
bear
himself
honestly
to
all
men
we
will
first
gently
entreat
this
man
to
give
us
entertainment
and
if
he
will
not
listen
to
gentle
words
then
will
we
threaten
him
for
some
who
heed
not
fair
words
will
take
account
of
foul
and
if
we
accomplish
nothing
either
by
entreaties
or
by
threats
then
we
will
make
our
way
into
his
dwelling
by
force
and
deal
with
him
as
he
so
be
it
said
sir
paridell
and
coming
to
the
gate
he
knocked
sir
porter
he
said
two
knights
seek
shelter
and
now
the
porter
was
malbecco
himself
for
it
was
his
custom
to
play
the
porter
s
part
he
answered
all
in
this
house
my
friend
are
now
gone
to
their
beds
and
the
keys
have
been
taken
to
the
master
of
the
house
and
he
also
is
in
his
bed
nor
is
there
anyone
so
bold
that
would
venture
to
wake
him
from
his
sleep
i
pray
you
therefore
to
be
patient
and
to
seek
entertainment
the
two
knights
were
not
a
little
wroth
at
this
fellow
s
churlishness
but
knew
not
what
they
should
do
for
he
took
no
heed
neither
of
blandishments
nor
of
threats
and
while
they
parleyed
with
him
the
sky
was
overcast
and
there
came
so
bitter
a
blast
of
wind
and
so
fierce
a
storm
of
rain
and
hail
that
they
were
constrained
to
depart
and
seek
shelter
in
a
little
hut
that
was
near
at
hand
being
a
sty
for
pigs
while
they
were
faring
as
best
they
could
in
this
place
there
came
another
knight
to
the
castle
gate
he
also
sought
for
entertainment
and
was
denied
and
he
also
under
compulsion
from
the
storm
sought
shelter
in
the
hut
and
when
the
place
being
indeed
already
filled
he
was
not
suffered
to
enter
he
fell
into
a
great
rage
nay
said
he
this
will
i
not
suffer
either
i
will
lodge
with
you
or
you
shall
be
dislodged
choose
then
whether
of
these
two
things
ye
will
the
two
knights
scarce
knew
how
they
should
answer
him
they
liked
not
to
deny
him
lodging
and
they
liked
not
to
yield
to
his
boasting
but
of
the
two
paridell
was
the
less
disposed
to
take
the
matter
patiently
who
is
this
fellow
said
he
who
talks
to
me
as
though
he
were
rating
a
dog
in
a
kennel
of
a
truth
if
he
is
a
dog
of
spirit
he
would
rather
die
than
lie
like
a
coward
in
a
so
saying
he
issued
forth
and
came
to
blows
with
the
stranger
and
doubtless
mischief
had
been
done
but
that
the
good
satyrane
made
peace
between
them
this
done
they
agreed
together
to
punish
the
lord
of
the
castle
for
his
churlishness
so
they
went
back
to
the
gate
and
paridell
cried
aloud
hark
sir
porter
whoever
you
are
if
you
open
not
this
gate
then
we
will
burn
this
place
and
all
that
is
therein
with
when
malbecco
heard
this
perceiving
that
they
were
in
earnest
he
ran
with
all
speed
and
called
to
them
from
the
castle
walls
bear
with
me
fair
sirs
he
cried
and
pardon
me
seeing
that
i
am
so
these
loutish
knaves
of
mine
know
not
their
duty
and
fail
to
attend
as
they
should
upon
when
they
heard
this
the
knights
consented
to
let
the
matter
be
though
they
believed
not
a
word
of
what
the
man
had
said
so
they
entered
the
castle
being
within
the
walls
they
rid
themselves
of
their
armour
for
they
were
fain
to
dry
their
garments
at
the
fire
and
lo
when
the
last
come
of
the
three
took
off
his
helmet
the
hair
which
was
of
golden
hue
broke
loose
from
its
tie
and
fell
down
to
her
feet
like
the
sunbeams
that
fall
from
a
cloud
and
when
she
doffed
her
coat
of
mail
and
let
down
the
pleated
frock
she
had
tucked
up
for
convenience
sake
in
riding
then
it
was
plain
to
see
that
she
was
a
woman
and
indeed
the
very
fairest
of
women
for
in
sooth
this
last
come
of
the
three
knights
was
britomart
chapter
xviii
sir
scudamore
and
amoret
britomart
riding
forth
on
the
day
following
from
malbecco
s
castle
came
to
a
fountain
whereby
a
knight
was
lying
stretched
upon
the
ground
his
cuirass
and
his
helmet
and
his
spear
lay
near
him
and
his
shield
on
which
was
the
emblem
of
love
as
a
boy
with
wings
was
thrown
carelessly
on
the
ground
he
lay
with
his
face
upon
the
ground
and
it
seemed
as
if
he
were
asleep
so
that
britomart
of
her
courtesy
held
back
lest
perchance
she
should
wake
him
but
as
she
stood
she
heard
him
groan
and
after
break
forth
into
bitter
complaining
o
god
he
cried
who
rulest
in
bliss
among
thy
saints
why
sufferest
thou
such
cruel
deeds
to
be
done
hast
thou
no
care
for
the
cause
of
the
innocent
is
thy
justice
asleep
what
doth
it
profit
a
man
to
do
righteously
if
righteousness
find
no
reward
never
was
there
on
earth
a
creature
more
gracious
than
my
amoret
and
lo
for
seven
months
the
tyrant
busirane
holds
her
in
prison
and
all
forsooth
because
she
will
not
deny
her
scudamore
and
i
this
same
scudamore
am
safe
and
sound
and
yet
can
help
her
not
at
all
then
he
burst
forth
into
a
storm
of
sobs
so
shaken
and
disturbed
was
he
with
the
torment
of
his
grief
that
britomart
feared
that
he
might
even
die
so
stooping
down
she
touched
him
lightly
on
the
shoulder
whereat
he
starting
up
looked
to
see
what
had
happened
and
finding
that
it
was
but
a
stranger
knight
he
threw
himself
again
upon
the
ground
then
said
britomart
sir
knight
whose
sorrow
seems
to
overpass
your
patience
i
would
counsel
you
to
submit
your
will
to
the
providence
of
god
remember
if
you
will
that
virtue
and
faith
are
mightier
than
the
very
worst
of
sorrows
surely
he
who
can
not
bear
the
burden
of
this
world
s
distresses
must
not
think
to
live
for
life
is
a
distressful
thing
and
now
tell
me
what
this
villain
of
whom
you
speak
has
done
maybe
this
hand
of
mine
may
help
you
to
win
relief
and
then
said
the
knight
ah
me
it
is
idle
to
complain
of
what
may
not
be
cured
i
fear
me
much
that
there
is
no
remedy
for
this
trouble
how
can
we
deliver
my
amoret
from
the
dungeon
in
which
this
tyrant
holds
her
and
all
because
she
will
not
accept
his
love
nor
be
false
to
me
for
indeed
he
has
fortified
the
place
with
such
magic
charms
that
no
power
of
man
can
overcome
nevertheless
said
britomart
we
will
make
our
why
should
you
die
for
me
said
the
knight
it
is
enough
that
i
should
perish
who
deserve
it
nay
cried
britomart
life
is
not
lost
if
the
fame
that
dies
not
be
bought
with
so
at
last
she
persuaded
him
to
rise
from
the
ground
his
armour
she
helped
him
to
put
on
and
his
horse
which
had
strayed
away
she
brought
back
to
him
then
they
set
off
for
the
magician
s
castle
which
was
but
a
away
but
when
they
were
arrived
lo
there
was
no
gate
no
nor
porter
nor
watchman
but
in
the
porch
there
was
a
flaming
fire
and
a
great
smoke
of
sulphur
so
fierce
was
the
fire
and
so
thick
the
smoke
that
they
were
compelled
to
fall
back
to
run
into
danger
without
thought
sir
knight
said
britomart
is
becoming
to
a
beast
not
to
a
man
let
us
think
therefore
how
we
may
most
prudently
deal
with
this
alas
answered
sir
scudamore
for
this
was
the
knight
s
name
here
you
see
the
doleful
straits
in
which
i
stand
this
is
the
trouble
of
which
i
complained
by
no
cleverness
or
strength
or
valor
may
these
flames
be
quenched
for
no
man
can
undo
the
enchantments
by
which
they
have
been
kindled
leave
me
to
my
complaints
fair
amoret
must
dwell
as
before
in
this
evil
prison
and
scudamore
must
die
of
by
heaven
cried
britomart
it
were
a
shameful
thing
to
give
up
some
noble
purpose
for
fear
of
danger
without
some
venture
made
let
us
make
a
trial
at
the
least
and
see
what
shall
come
to
and
as
she
spoke
the
bold
maiden
threw
her
broad
shield
before
her
face
and
pointing
her
sword
straight
in
front
of
her
threw
herself
upon
the
fire
and
behold
the
flames
straightway
parted
asunder
leaving
a
space
in
the
middle
through
which
she
passed
as
a
flash
of
lightning
passes
through
the
clouds
and
when
sir
scudamore
saw
how
she
had
traversed
the
fire
safe
and
untouched
he
essayed
to
follow
her
but
whether
it
was
that
there
was
a
certain
jealousy
in
his
heart
or
some
less
pure
desire
or
some
lack
of
faith
to
him
the
flames
yielded
not
one
jot
his
pride
and
fierceness
availed
him
nothing
he
was
constrained
to
return
most
piteously
burnt
greatly
was
he
troubled
at
this
defeat
so
that
he
threw
himself
on
the
ground
and
groaned
aloud
in
the
bitterness
of
his
heart
britomart
meanwhile
had
made
her
way
into
the
palace
of
the
enchanter
the
first
chamber
was
a
wondrous
place
all
its
walls
being
covered
with
tapestries
picturing
the
triumphs
of
love
many
a
strange
tale
of
the
gods
might
there
be
seen
and
with
the
gods
was
shown
a
great
multitude
of
men
and
women
both
of
high
degree
and
low
kings
and
queens
and
knights
and
ladies
and
peasants
and
women
who
worked
with
their
hands
for
love
has
no
respect
of
person
and
there
are
none
but
feel
his
power
and
round
about
the
tapestries
was
woven
a
border
of
broken
bows
and
shivered
arrows
and
through
them
flowed
as
it
were
a
river
of
blood
at
the
end
of
the
chamber
was
an
altar
and
on
the
altar
was
set
the
image
of
a
boy
blindfolded
was
he
and
in
his
hand
he
held
a
deadly
bow
with
an
arrow
set
and
on
his
shoulders
he
carried
a
quiver
and
some
of
the
shots
were
tipped
with
gold
and
some
with
lead
and
under
his
foot
was
a
dragon
which
had
been
smitten
through
with
a
dart
under
his
feet
was
written
this
inscription
the
conqueror
of
the
all
this
the
maid
beheld
and
also
she
saw
that
over
every
door
in
the
chamber
and
there
were
many
such
doors
the
words
were
written
be
bold
but
over
one
door
at
the
very
end
of
the
chamber
were
these
words
to
be
seen
be
not
much
she
marvelled
to
see
no
living
creature
for
the
whole
place
was
silent
and
empty
but
the
day
being
now
far
spent
she
lay
down
to
sleep
but
was
careful
to
keep
her
arms
close
at
hand
should
need
arise
she
slept
not
untroubled
first
there
was
the
sound
of
a
great
trumpet
but
whether
it
were
blown
for
victory
or
for
warning
she
knew
not
and
after
the
trumpet
there
was
a
great
storm
of
wind
with
thunder
and
lightning
and
after
the
lightning
an
earthquake
and
after
the
earthquake
a
great
stench
and
smoke
of
sulphur
yet
was
not
britomart
one
whit
dismayed
then
as
she
wondered
what
these
things
might
mean
a
great
whirlwind
blew
throughout
the
house
and
the
door
over
which
the
words
be
not
were
written
flew
open
of
its
own
accord
and
out
of
it
there
issued
a
marvellous
array
first
came
fancy
in
likeness
of
a
lovely
boy
and
after
him
desire
and
then
doubt
ever
looking
about
him
with
restless
eyes
and
danger
and
fear
who
ever
kept
his
eye
on
danger
and
hope
in
the
semblance
of
a
happy
maiden
and
suspicion
and
grief
and
fury
and
many
more
which
it
were
long
to
name
one
by
one
thrice
did
they
march
round
the
chamber
and
then
returned
to
that
within
from
which
they
had
come
forth
and
when
the
last
had
passed
through
the
door
shut
as
it
had
opened
at
the
first
of
its
own
accord
and
when
the
maid
would
have
passed
through
it
she
found
it
locked
fast
against
her
and
beyond
all
her
strength
to
open
then
finding
that
she
could
do
nothing
by
force
she
had
recourse
to
craft
purposing
not
to
depart
from
the
chamber
till
the
next
night
should
come
and
with
the
night
the
same
procession
of
figures
should
come
forth
and
so
it
fell
out
and
when
the
door
opened
next
of
its
own
accord
then
britomart
went
boldly
in
not
one
single
figure
did
she
see
of
all
that
wondrous
company
there
was
no
living
creature
in
the
chamber
save
one
lady
of
woeful
aspect
whose
hands
were
bound
fast
together
while
round
her
waist
was
a
chain
which
bound
her
to
a
pillar
and
before
her
sat
the
enchanter
making
strange
characters
which
were
among
the
devices
of
his
art
in
blood
he
drew
them
and
the
blood
seemed
to
be
drawn
from
the
woeful
lady
s
heart
by
an
arrow
which
was
fastened
in
her
side
when
the
enchanter
saw
the
maid
he
cast
his
magic
book
in
haste
to
the
ground
and
drawing
from
his
vest
a
murderous
knife
made
as
though
he
would
have
thrust
it
into
the
lady
s
side
but
the
maid
caught
his
hand
and
mastered
him
not
so
completely
did
she
quell
him
but
that
with
a
sudden
wrench
he
turned
the
dagger
upon
her
and
struck
it
into
her
chest
it
was
but
a
shallow
wound
but
it
moved
her
wrath
and
she
drawing
forth
her
sword
dealt
him
a
mighty
blow
so
that
he
fell
half
dead
upon
the
ground
but
as
she
made
ready
to
smite
him
again
the
woeful
lady
cried
slay
him
not
for
if
he
die
then
am
i
here
fast
bound
for
ever
for
only
he
that
has
bound
can
full
wroth
was
britomart
to
spare
so
foul
a
wretch
nevertheless
for
the
lady
s
sake
she
held
her
hand
and
said
o
wicked
man
death
or
that
which
is
worse
than
death
if
such
there
be
is
the
due
reward
of
your
crimes
nevertheless
you
may
live
if
you
will
restore
this
lady
to
her
first
to
this
the
wretch
so
reprieved
beyond
all
hope
gave
a
willing
consent
and
taking
up
his
book
began
to
reverse
his
evil
charms
many
a
dreadful
thing
did
he
read
which
the
lady
heard
with
trembling
seeing
that
they
had
brought
her
to
this
evil
plight
and
all
the
while
britomart
stood
with
her
sword
drawn
over
his
head
ready
to
smite
him
if
he
should
fail
of
his
promise
and
now
all
the
house
began
to
shake
around
them
and
the
doors
to
rattle
yet
was
not
the
maid
dismayed
but
watched
the
villain
as
he
undid
the
charm
and
now
the
chain
was
broken
from
off
the
lady
s
hands
and
that
which
did
bind
her
to
the
pillar
was
severed
and
the
pillar
itself
fell
into
ruins
and
the
steel
by
which
her
was
drained
away
came
forth
from
the
wound
no
one
drawing
it
and
the
wound
itself
was
closed
and
the
lady
herself
restored
to
her
first
estate
when
she
found
herself
thus
whole
again
she
poured
out
her
heart
in
thanks
to
the
maid
throwing
herself
upon
the
ground
before
her
gentle
lady
said
britomart
it
is
reward
enough
to
have
done
you
this
service
and
now
forget
your
trouble
and
take
comfort
to
yourself
and
comfort
also
the
true
knight
who
has
suffered
so
much
for
your
right
glad
was
amoret
to
hear
such
kindly
words
of
the
man
whom
she
loved
then
did
britomart
take
the
chain
with
which
amoret
had
been
bound
and
bind
the
enchanter
with
it
and
this
was
a
fit
beginning
of
the
punishment
which
was
to
fall
upon
him
this
done
they
turned
to
depart
and
as
they
passed
through
the
enchanter
s
abode
lo
all
the
grace
and
glory
had
departed
from
it
all
the
fair
picturings
were
defaced
and
when
they
came
to
the
fiery
porch
the
flames
were
vanished
and
the
place
was
like
to
a
torch
that
is
half
burned
but
as
nothing
in
the
world
is
without
trouble
so
to
their
great
trouble
they
found
no
one
awaiting
them
neither
did
amoret
see
sir
scudamore
nor
britomart
her
squire
chapter
xix
of
sir
paridell
and
others
it
was
in
truth
a
great
deliverance
that
britomart
had
worked
for
the
lady
amoret
nevertheless
this
same
lady
was
somewhat
in
doubt
how
she
should
bear
herself
to
her
deliverer
for
on
the
one
hand
she
was
well
aware
that
all
her
love
and
homage
was
due
to
sir
scudamore
nor
was
there
aught
in
her
heart
that
hindered
her
from
rendering
it
it
should
be
told
indeed
that
she
was
not
only
betrothed
to
this
same
scudamore
but
verily
wedded
only
it
had
come
to
pass
on
the
very
when
the
guests
were
somewhat
overtaken
with
wine
that
the
enchanter
busyrane
had
entered
the
palace
and
under
cover
of
a
jest
had
carried
her
away
into
captivity
so
now
she
said
to
herself
this
is
a
very
noble
knight
and
it
irks
me
to
show
him
any
discourtesy
yet
on
the
other
hand
i
fear
me
much
lest
i
should
seem
in
any
wise
disloyal
to
my
own
dear
lord
for
she
knew
not
that
britomart
was
a
maid
and
britomart
on
her
part
desiring
that
the
secret
should
not
be
known
bore
herself
with
a
certain
freedom
nothing
unseemly
did
she
say
or
do
but
none
had
guessed
her
to
be
what
she
was
as
they
journeyed
together
they
came
to
a
castle
where
a
great
company
of
knights
and
ladies
had
assembled
to
hold
a
tournament
now
it
was
a
custom
of
tournament
that
every
knight
entering
the
lists
bore
the
colours
of
some
lady
and
averred
that
she
was
the
fairest
of
all
ladies
and
that
he
would
prove
it
with
spear
and
sword
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
knights
were
gathered
together
and
the
master
of
the
ceremony
asked
of
each
his
lady
s
name
a
certain
young
and
lusty
knight
cried
out
my
lady
is
the
fair
amoret
and
that
i
will
avow
with
spear
and
when
britomart
heard
these
words
she
was
not
a
little
wroth
nevertheless
she
dissembled
her
anger
and
said
only
i
am
loath
to
make
strife
but
this
young
man
must
needs
make
good
his
words
so
they
jousted
together
and
the
knight
was
easily
overthrown
being
thus
made
to
suffer
for
coveting
that
which
was
not
his
but
britomart
seeing
that
he
was
a
brave
man
and
being
herself
as
courteous
as
she
was
strong
cast
about
how
she
could
save
his
honour
she
said
therefore
to
the
master
of
the
ceremony
let
me
have
this
knight
for
my
and
as
she
spoke
she
doffed
her
helmet
and
her
golden
hair
which
had
been
cunningly
coiled
up
within
fell
down
to
her
very
feet
all
that
stood
by
both
ladies
and
knights
were
not
a
little
amazed
some
said
this
is
wrought
by
magic
others
this
is
bellona
s
self
that
has
come
among
mortal
as
for
the
young
knight
he
worshipped
her
as
though
she
were
divine
and
the
fair
amoret
all
her
doubts
being
removed
was
knit
to
her
in
the
closest
bonds
of
affection
and
tenderness
the
next
morning
they
departed
together
from
the
castle
the
one
ever
cherishing
in
her
heart
the
thought
of
sir
artegall
and
the
other
of
sir
scudamore
after
a
while
they
were
aware
of
two
knights
riding
towards
them
having
each
a
lady
at
his
side
ladies
indeed
they
were
not
save
in
outward
appearance
for
one
was
the
false
duessa
the
other
was
called
até
which
name
by
interpretation
is
strife
than
whom
there
is
no
more
baleful
creature
under
the
sun
and
she
has
her
dwelling
hard
by
the
gates
of
hell
many
ways
are
there
by
which
a
man
may
go
into
that
place
but
none
by
which
he
may
come
forth
and
the
walls
on
every
side
are
hung
with
the
rent
robes
and
broken
sceptres
of
kings
shivered
spears
and
shields
torn
in
twain
spoils
of
babylon
and
of
rome
relics
of
great
empires
that
have
been
and
are
no
more
até
herself
was
hideous
to
behold
if
one
could
see
her
as
she
was
in
truth
but
now
she
was
fair
to
look
at
for
she
had
put
on
as
can
all
evil
things
the
semblance
of
beauty
the
knight
who
rode
by
her
side
was
a
certain
blandamour
gallant
and
strong
and
most
expert
in
arms
but
of
a
fickle
and
inconstant
heart
and
he
that
was
companion
to
the
false
duessa
was
sir
paridell
when
sir
blandamour
saw
from
afar
britomart
and
amoret
he
said
to
sir
paridell
see
you
my
friend
that
knight
with
a
lady
by
his
side
there
is
a
fair
adventure
for
you
but
sir
paridell
for
now
they
were
near
enough
to
discern
the
fashion
of
britomart
s
arms
perceived
that
this
knight
bore
the
like
scutcheon
to
one
by
whom
he
had
of
late
been
worsted
in
battle
nor
was
he
minded
to
tempt
his
fate
again
i
know
that
knight
full
well
sir
blandamour
he
said
he
proved
his
skill
on
me
and
i
count
it
folly
when
he
who
has
escaped
a
danger
challenges
it
then
i
replied
sir
blandamour
will
try
my
fortune
take
you
meanwhile
this
dame
in
and
he
laid
his
spear
in
rest
and
charged
britomart
on
her
part
made
ready
to
receive
him
and
gave
him
an
uncouth
welcome
scarce
had
they
met
than
he
found
himself
lying
helpless
on
the
ground
meanwhile
his
conquering
adversary
rode
on
not
deigning
so
much
as
to
say
a
single
word
when
his
companions
saw
in
what
an
evil
plight
he
was
they
hastened
to
his
help
and
put
him
on
his
steed
for
mount
himself
he
could
not
and
held
him
up
as
he
rode
he
was
that
he
had
ventured
so
much
and
won
so
little
after
that
they
had
journeyed
awhile
they
saw
two
knights
coming
towards
them
across
the
plain
when
sir
blandamour
perceived
them
he
grieved
more
than
ever
for
his
late
mishap
for
he
saw
that
one
of
them
was
his
old
enemy
sir
scudamore
knowing
him
to
be
such
by
the
device
that
he
wore
to
wit
the
god
of
love
with
his
wings
spread
out
on
this
side
and
on
that
here
he
said
to
himself
is
evil
fortune
yonder
is
my
enemy
and
i
am
so
bruised
with
this
late
encounter
that
i
can
not
do
battle
with
then
he
said
to
sir
paridell
my
friend
will
you
of
your
affection
do
somewhat
for
me
even
as
i
have
done
for
you
my
hurts
keep
me
back
from
battle
but
i
have
just
cause
of
enmity
against
yonder
knight
will
you
therefore
maintain
this
my
cause
against
him
sir
paridell
answered
trouble
not
yourself
there
is
a
proverb
that
the
left
hand
rubs
the
right
as
you
have
fought
for
me
so
will
i
for
forthwith
he
laid
his
spear
in
rest
and
charged
swift
as
an
arrow
from
a
bow
nor
was
sir
scudamore
slow
to
make
himself
ready
so
they
met
in
fierce
encounter
and
with
so
great
a
shock
that
both
were
driven
from
their
saddles
and
they
lay
stretched
upon
the
ground
sir
scudamore
was
soon
on
his
feet
again
and
said
to
the
other
laggard
why
lie
you
so
long
but
sir
paridell
lay
tumbled
in
a
heap
without
sense
or
speech
all
unheeding
of
his
adversary
s
reproach
then
his
companion
ran
to
him
and
unlaced
his
helmet
and
loosened
his
coat
of
mail
and
so
brought
him
back
to
feeling
but
not
a
word
did
he
speak
then
said
sir
blandamour
false
knight
you
have
overcome
by
craft
a
better
man
than
yourself
it
is
well
for
you
that
i
am
not
in
such
good
case
that
i
can
avenge
to
this
sir
scudamore
made
no
answer
though
there
was
great
anger
in
his
heart
then
the
false
duessa
not
seeing
how
her
ends
would
be
served
by
a
quarrel
between
these
two
would
have
made
peace
between
them
but
on
the
other
hand
até
made
up
a
fresh
contention
for
she
turned
sir
scudamore
against
amoret
slandering
that
true
lady
with
false
tales
of
how
she
had
given
her
love
to
a
stranger
knight
who
indeed
was
none
other
than
britomart
nor
was
she
content
with
this
but
she
made
a
quarrel
also
between
paridell
and
blandamour
and
the
contention
between
these
two
grew
so
hot
that
they
were
ready
to
do
battle
with
each
other
what
had
been
the
end
thereof
none
can
say
but
by
good
luck
there
came
that
way
a
certain
squire
who
was
well
known
to
both
and
not
a
little
beloved
by
them
no
easy
thing
was
it
for
him
to
get
hearing
from
the
two
so
full
of
fury
were
they
yet
at
the
last
he
persuaded
them
to
stay
their
hands
this
done
he
said
brave
knights
you
ought
to
be
at
peace
and
not
at
variance
there
are
those
that
seek
your
harm
and
you
would
do
well
to
ally
yourselves
against
thus
he
persuaded
them
to
swear
friendship
again
so
being
reconciled
they
pursued
their
journey
after
a
while
they
saw
two
knights
and
two
ladies
with
them
and
they
sent
on
their
squire
to
inquire
who
these
might
be
and
when
the
squire
came
back
to
his
company
he
said
these
are
two
famous
knights
brave
cambell
and
stout
triamond
and
the
ladies
are
cambina
who
is
wife
to
cambell
and
canacé
who
is
wedded
to
triamond
but
would
it
please
you
gentle
sirs
to
hear
their
story
for
i
know
it
well
and
it
is
worth
the
hearing
sir
blandamour
answered
speak
so
the
squire
told
this
tale
that
follows
chapter
xx
the
story
of
canacé
and
the
three
brothers
there
was
a
great
lady
in
fairyland
agapé
by
name
who
had
three
sons
born
all
of
them
at
one
birth
and
the
names
of
the
three
were
priamond
diamond
and
triamond
also
she
had
a
daughter
cambina
by
name
now
the
lady
agapé
greatly
desired
to
know
how
long
her
sons
should
live
for
they
having
a
mortal
for
their
father
must
needs
die
some
day
whereas
she
being
of
fairy
race
was
immortal
having
therefore
this
thought
in
her
mind
she
made
her
way
to
the
place
where
the
three
fates
sit
by
the
distaff
spinning
the
lines
of
life
one
sister
draws
out
the
thread
and
another
turns
the
spindle
and
yet
another
sitting
by
with
the
shears
in
her
hand
cuts
the
thread
when
the
due
time
is
come
deep
in
the
hidden
places
of
the
earth
was
the
dwelling
of
the
three
and
the
way
thereto
was
dark
and
hard
to
find
but
agapé
had
in
her
heart
all
the
wisdom
of
fairyland
nor
did
she
fail
to
accomplish
her
purpose
when
she
had
come
to
the
place
she
sat
awhile
and
watched
the
sisters
at
their
work
at
last
having
seen
all
that
they
did
she
declared
why
she
had
come
i
have
three
sons
she
said
mortal
men
though
i
myself
am
immortal
and
i
greatly
desire
to
know
how
long
they
will
one
of
the
sisters
she
that
held
the
shears
was
very
angry
when
she
heard
these
words
you
have
done
ill
she
said
in
coming
here
on
this
errand
these
things
are
not
for
anyone
mortal
or
immortal
to
know
you
deserve
to
be
smitten
with
the
curse
of
and
your
children
with
illustration
agapé
approaching
the
dwelling
of
the
fates
agapé
was
greatly
frightened
at
these
words
still
she
held
to
her
purpose
and
with
many
prayers
and
entreaties
prevailed
upon
her
that
held
the
spindle
for
she
was
less
hard
of
heart
than
the
sister
who
held
the
shears
to
show
her
the
threads
of
the
three
youths
when
she
saw
them
she
cried
i
pray
you
draw
them
out
longer
and
of
a
stouter
nay
said
the
sister
think
you
o
foolish
one
that
the
purposes
of
the
fates
may
be
changed
as
are
the
purposes
of
men
it
is
not
so
what
they
decree
stands
fast
for
ever
the
gods
may
not
move
it
by
one
hair
no
nor
the
ruler
of
the
gods
then
answered
agapé
if
this
be
so
if
you
can
not
add
one
jot
to
the
thread
of
any
man
s
life
still
there
is
a
boon
which
you
can
give
me
i
see
the
thread
of
my
eldest
son
and
it
is
i
perceive
the
shortest
of
the
three
grant
that
when
it
is
cut
with
the
shears
it
may
be
added
to
the
thread
of
the
second
and
that
in
like
manner
when
the
thread
of
the
second
is
cut
it
may
be
joined
to
the
third
so
shall
he
have
a
treble
portion
and
yet
the
whole
shall
not
have
been
the
sisters
said
this
shall
be
thereupon
the
lady
agapé
departed
to
her
own
home
she
told
her
sons
nothing
of
this
journey
which
she
had
taken
or
of
the
things
which
she
had
seen
and
heard
or
of
the
boon
which
had
been
granted
to
her
in
the
matter
of
their
lives
but
she
said
to
them
not
at
that
time
only
but
after
whenever
she
could
find
occasion
o
my
sons
be
careful
and
walk
in
safe
ways
but
above
all
things
love
one
another
whatever
may
and
this
they
did
all
their
lives
never
was
there
any
strife
between
them
but
only
great
friendship
and
concord
of
which
the
most
signal
proof
is
now
to
be
told
there
was
a
fair
lady
in
those
parts
canacé
by
name
who
was
wiser
than
all
the
women
of
her
day
she
knew
all
the
powers
of
nature
and
could
see
beforehand
the
things
that
should
come
to
pass
and
knew
the
speech
of
beasts
and
birds
and
as
she
was
wise
above
all
others
so
also
did
she
excel
in
goodness
to
these
things
she
added
also
a
singular
beauty
so
that
many
lords
and
knights
of
the
land
came
to
woo
her
to
these
she
bare
herself
rightly
courteously
but
favoured
none
no
not
so
much
as
by
a
word
or
a
look
but
it
came
to
pass
as
is
the
way
in
such
matters
that
the
more
she
held
herself
aloof
the
more
eagerly
did
these
lords
and
knights
urge
their
suit
upon
her
and
not
a
few
quarrels
came
about
on
her
account
one
suitor
meeting
another
in
battle
now
this
canacé
had
a
brother
cambell
by
name
as
brave
and
stout
a
knight
as
ever
lived
and
he
seeing
that
great
mischief
might
arise
out
of
these
quarrels
concerning
his
sister
caused
all
her
wooers
to
come
together
and
made
this
proclamation
among
them
ye
lords
and
knights
that
seek
my
sister
canacé
in
marriage
choose
now
from
among
yourselves
the
three
whom
you
judge
to
be
the
boldest
and
most
skilful
in
battle
among
you
and
let
them
meet
me
in
combat
man
by
man
and
it
shall
be
that
whosoever
of
the
three
shall
prevail
over
me
shall
have
my
sister
to
now
this
cambell
was
as
has
been
already
said
a
brave
knight
and
a
stout
yet
for
all
his
strength
and
courage
he
had
scarcely
dared
to
stand
up
in
this
fashion
against
so
many
for
indeed
it
might
well
come
to
pass
such
are
the
chances
of
battle
that
one
or
other
might
prevail
over
him
not
being
the
better
man
but
by
reason
of
some
accident
but
there
was
that
which
encouraged
him
to
dare
so
much
to
wit
a
magic
ring
which
his
sister
had
given
him
it
was
a
ring
of
many
virtues
but
the
chief
of
them
all
was
this
that
if
he
who
wore
it
should
be
wounded
this
ring
straightway
staunched
the
bleeding
now
this
matter
of
the
magic
ring
and
its
marvellous
virtues
was
known
to
all
and
the
suitors
of
the
lady
canacé
were
for
the
most
part
terrified
by
it
so
that
they
would
not
venture
on
the
battle
fair
she
is
without
doubt
they
said
but
it
would
be
a
fool
s
part
to
venture
life
even
for
nevertheless
there
were
three
among
them
who
were
not
of
this
way
of
thinking
and
these
three
were
the
brothers
priamond
diamond
and
triamond
they
all
loved
the
princess
and
yet
so
brotherly
were
they
in
heart
and
mind
that
there
was
not
a
thought
of
anger
or
jealousy
among
them
let
her
choose
said
they
between
us
and
we
will
be
content
with
her
choice
or
if
the
judgment
be
left
to
the
sword
then
let
him
be
preferred
who
shall
overcome
this
her
brother
so
the
three
addressed
themselves
to
the
battle
in
the
order
of
their
age
first
came
priamond
the
eldest
a
stout
knight
to
hold
his
place
but
he
was
not
so
strong
to
strike
as
are
some
he
loved
to
fight
on
foot
and
his
arms
were
the
spear
and
the
next
to
him
was
diamond
he
was
one
to
deal
mighty
blows
but
he
was
not
so
good
in
holding
his
ground
whether
he
were
on
horseback
or
on
foot
he
cared
not
so
that
he
had
his
in
hand
for
with
this
he
loved
to
fight
last
of
all
came
triamond
there
was
no
man
better
than
he
whether
to
stand
or
to
strike
the
fight
on
horseback
pleased
him
best
and
his
arms
were
spear
and
shield
on
a
set
day
the
lists
were
prepared
barriers
were
made
to
keep
off
the
press
of
the
people
at
one
end
sat
six
judges
who
should
see
that
all
things
were
done
decently
and
in
order
and
that
neither
this
warrior
nor
that
should
take
undue
advantage
and
at
the
other
was
set
the
fair
canacé
on
a
stage
that
she
might
see
the
battle
and
herself
be
seen
the
first
that
came
into
the
lists
was
sir
cambell
noble
was
his
mien
and
assured
his
look
as
of
one
that
knew
certainly
that
he
should
prevail
after
him
advanced
the
three
brothers
bravely
attired
and
shining
in
arms
each
with
his
banner
borne
before
him
thrice
did
they
bow
themselves
before
the
fair
canacé
and
then
a
blast
of
the
trumpet
gave
the
signal
for
battle
first
of
the
three
to
meet
sir
cambell
came
priamond
well
skilled
in
arms
were
the
two
and
for
long
they
fought
without
advantage
to
one
or
the
other
mighty
the
blows
that
they
dealt
but
both
had
watchful
eyes
and
ready
skill
to
turn
the
deadliest
stroke
aside
the
first
gain
fell
to
sir
priamond
for
his
spear
whether
by
good
fortune
or
by
skill
it
were
hard
to
say
passed
by
his
adversary
s
shield
and
pierced
the
shoulder
where
a
joint
of
the
armour
gave
it
access
deep
was
the
wound
and
though
no
blood
flowed
was
the
virtue
of
the
magic
stung
the
warrior
to
the
quick
with
keenest
pain
there
are
whose
spirit
is
quelled
with
pain
but
sir
cambell
was
not
of
these
the
smart
did
but
rouse
his
courage
to
the
utmost
and
put
new
strength
into
his
arm
straightway
he
drave
his
spear
close
underneath
sir
priamond
s
shield
and
smote
him
on
the
thigh
the
coat
of
mail
did
not
stay
it
but
that
it
made
a
grisly
wound
and
the
stout
knight
tottered
with
the
blow
even
as
an
old
oak
withered
and
sapless
rocks
with
every
blast
of
the
wind
nor
did
cambell
fail
to
use
the
occasion
he
smote
him
yet
again
upon
the
side
making
another
deadly
wound
and
though
the
spear
brake
with
the
blow
he
did
not
abate
his
onset
but
drave
the
shaft
through
the
visor
of
sir
priamond
s
helmet
and
laid
him
low
upon
the
ground
so
fell
the
first
of
the
three
brothers
yet
did
not
his
soul
depart
but
by
virtue
of
the
gift
of
the
fates
it
passed
into
the
bodies
of
the
two
that
yet
remained
making
them
stronger
and
more
eager
for
the
fray
nevertheless
when
sir
diamond
addressed
himself
to
the
battle
the
lists
having
been
cleared
afresh
and
the
trumpet
sounded
a
second
time
he
fared
no
better
than
his
brother
for
a
while
the
two
stood
face
to
face
giving
and
receiving
equal
blows
but
without
advantage
either
to
the
one
or
to
the
other
but
then
a
great
gust
of
wrath
swept
through
sir
diamond
s
soul
driving
away
all
thought
but
of
how
he
might
most
speedily
avenge
his
brother
and
indeed
the
very
soul
of
the
brother
stirred
within
him
so
he
lifted
high
his
mighty
swinging
it
over
his
head
and
bringing
it
down
on
his
adversary
with
all
the
force
that
was
in
his
body
and
surely
had
the
blow
fallen
as
it
was
meant
there
had
been
an
end
of
strife
no
magic
ring
had
availed
to
stay
so
dreadful
an
onset
it
had
crushed
out
sir
cambell
s
life
whether
with
or
without
the
shedding
of
blood
but
fortune
helped
him
in
his
need
for
judging
where
the
axe
would
fall
he
swerved
aside
so
that
the
stroke
missed
the
mark
and
the
striker
s
right
foot
slid
from
under
him
so
we
may
see
a
hawk
strike
at
a
heron
with
all
his
might
so
strong
is
the
blow
that
it
would
seem
as
if
nothing
could
turn
it
aside
but
the
heron
a
wary
bird
sees
it
come
and
lightly
avoids
it
so
that
the
hawk
is
brought
to
the
ground
ere
the
force
of
his
onset
is
sped
so
fared
it
with
sir
diamond
not
only
so
but
while
he
reached
forward
with
his
left
arm
to
recover
himself
he
left
his
side
unguarded
by
the
shield
which
thing
sir
cambell
did
not
fail
to
perceive
for
swinging
his
axe
he
smote
him
between
the
topmost
rings
of
the
coat
of
mail
and
the
lowest
rings
of
the
helmet
which
spot
is
ever
dangerous
to
the
warrior
how
well
soever
he
be
armed
there
did
sir
cambell
smite
sir
diamond
with
an
arm
so
sure
and
deadly
that
he
shore
his
head
from
his
body
and
now
ensued
the
fiercest
fight
of
all
yea
and
also
the
strangest
well
might
a
man
wonder
to
see
how
sir
cambell
stood
up
neither
faint
nor
weary
for
all
that
he
had
been
changing
blows
for
the
space
of
an
hour
and
more
yet
did
he
seem
even
fresher
and
brighter
than
at
his
first
taking
of
arms
just
as
some
great
serpent
wakes
from
the
long
sleep
of
winter
when
the
warm
breath
of
spring
has
touched
him
and
throws
off
the
ragged
skin
of
his
old
estate
and
raises
himself
in
the
sunshine
with
all
the
glory
of
his
youth
renewed
such
freshness
and
vigour
did
the
magic
ring
work
in
calling
out
all
the
strength
that
he
had
for
all
the
magic
in
the
world
had
not
availed
to
help
a
coward
or
a
sluggard
against
him
stood
a
worthy
foe
with
the
might
of
three
stout
champions
in
his
heart
and
in
his
limbs
once
and
again
yea
many
times
did
it
seem
that
this
or
that
warrior
had
prevailed
now
was
cambell
beaten
to
his
knee
till
all
the
company
thought
he
must
needs
lose
the
day
and
now
was
triamond
stretched
upon
the
ground
like
to
one
who
has
received
a
mortal
wound
and
once
indeed
the
two
lay
together
at
full
length
as
though
they
had
been
dead
the
judges
rose
from
their
place
and
the
marshals
of
the
lists
came
forward
as
to
carry
the
two
corpses
to
the
appointed
place
and
the
fair
canacé
cried
out
in
her
despair
for
it
seemed
as
if
both
brother
and
lover
had
been
taken
from
her
at
once
but
lo
in
a
moment
the
two
were
standing
on
their
feet
again
and
addressing
themselves
anew
to
the
battle
what
had
been
the
end
whether
the
virtue
of
the
magic
ring
had
overcome
the
triple
might
of
him
in
whom
dwelt
the
spirits
of
three
brave
men
who
can
say
for
now
there
was
heard
such
a
clamour
such
a
confusion
of
voices
such
a
shouting
of
men
and
wailing
of
women
and
shrill
crying
of
children
that
all
turned
their
faces
to
look
and
the
two
champions
by
common
consent
stayed
their
hands
till
they
could
see
what
strange
things
had
happened
and
indeed
it
was
a
marvellous
sight
that
they
saw
there
came
speeding
along
the
ground
fast
as
a
that
rides
the
sky
a
chariot
richly
adorned
with
gold
and
purple
in
the
persian
fashion
two
lions
from
the
forest
drew
it
mighty
beasts
such
as
could
not
be
surpassed
for
strength
and
fierceness
in
any
land
but
now
they
had
forgotten
their
savageness
to
obey
the
pleasure
of
their
driver
and
this
was
a
lady
of
wonderful
beauty
and
not
less
wise
than
fair
for
she
had
been
taught
all
the
arts
of
wholesome
magic
by
the
fairy
her
mother
in
her
right
hand
she
carried
a
wand
with
two
serpents
twined
about
it
and
in
her
left
a
cup
filled
to
the
brim
with
nepenthe
the
wondrous
drink
of
which
he
that
tastes
straightway
forgets
all
grief
and
anger
and
care
this
was
the
lady
cambina
daughter
of
agapé
and
sister
to
sir
triamond
and
she
knowing
by
her
art
in
what
deadly
peril
her
dear
brother
stood
came
to
his
help
all
the
people
made
a
way
for
her
to
pass
so
that
she
could
approach
the
lists
these
first
she
struck
with
her
wand
and
they
fell
at
the
stroke
then
she
said
to
the
two
champions
cease
now
your
strife
and
be
at
and
when
they
would
not
hear
but
made
as
if
to
renew
the
battle
she
cast
herself
upon
her
knees
and
besought
them
with
many
prayers
and
tears
to
cease
from
their
anger
and
when
they
still
hardened
their
hearts
she
smote
them
lightly
with
her
wand
so
soon
as
they
felt
the
touch
the
swords
dropped
from
their
hands
then
as
they
stood
astonished
not
knowing
what
had
befallen
them
she
gave
the
cup
first
to
one
and
then
to
the
other
and
they
as
being
consumed
by
mighty
thirst
drank
each
a
mighty
draught
straightway
the
magic
liquor
turned
all
their
strife
to
love
they
clasped
hands
and
plighted
troth
to
each
other
and
swore
that
they
would
be
friends
for
ever
and
such
indeed
they
were
to
the
end
of
their
days
ay

cambell

the
fair
canacé
chapter
xxi
the
story
of
florimell
it
has
been
related
before
how
sir
guyon
and
prince
arthur
parted
company
with
britomart
with
the
purpose
of
relieving
a
fair
lady
in
distress
now
the
name
of
this
same
lady
was
florimell
she
was
courted
by
many
knights
of
high
degree
but
her
love
was
given
to
sir
marinell
the
same
that
was
overthrown
by
britomart
in
the
passage
by
the
sea
but
he
on
his
part
had
no
thought
for
her
being
mindful
of
his
mother
s
counsel
that
he
should
hold
himself
aloof
from
all
womankind
so
fast
did
florimell
fly
for
she
was
in
grievous
fear
that
the
two
knights
who
followed
with
intent
to
give
her
help
could
by
no
means
overtake
her
after
a
while
the
strength
of
the
white
palfrey
on
which
she
rode
wholly
gave
out
and
she
alighting
made
her
way
on
foot
a
thing
which
she
had
never
done
in
all
her
life
before
so
delicately
bred
was
she
but
need
teaches
many
lessons
this
being
chief
among
them
that
fortune
holds
the
lots
of
all
in
equal
scales
and
has
no
respect
of
persons
so
travelling
she
came
to
a
hillside
from
which
looking
down
she
espied
a
valley
thickly
covered
with
trees
and
through
the
a
thin
vapour
of
smoke
issuing
forth
here
she
said
to
herself
is
a
dwelling
of
man
where
haply
i
may
find
shelter
and
so
she
bent
her
steps
thither
and
after
a
while
reached
the
place
being
now
sorely
spent
with
trouble
and
weariness
a
dwelling
there
was
but
of
the
humblest
kind
a
little
cottage
built
with
reeds
and
wattled
with
sods
of
grass
in
this
there
dwelt
a
witch
woman
most
sparely
did
she
live
careless
of
all
common
things
for
her
mind
was
wholly
given
to
her
art
for
the
better
and
more
secure
practice
of
which
she
lived
far
from
all
neighbours
when
florimell
came
in
the
witch
was
sitting
on
the
ground
and
was
so
busied
with
one
of
her
enchantments
that
she
was
taken
wholly
unawares
at
the
first
she
was
overcome
with
fear
for
she
would
not
that
any
should
surprise
her
while
she
was
busy
with
her
art
then
her
fear
changing
to
anger
as
indeed
it
is
commonly
wont
to
do
she
cried
in
a
loud
voice
stranger
what
mischief
has
brought
you
hither
here
of
a
truth
you
will
find
no
florimell
answered
mother
be
not
angry
with
a
simple
maid
who
has
been
brought
to
your
dwelling
by
hard
chance
and
asks
only
for
leave
to
rest
and
as
she
spoke
the
tears
came
trickling
down
her
cheeks
and
she
heaved
a
sigh
so
softly
and
sweetly
that
there
could
be
no
creature
so
hard
and
savage
that
would
not
have
pitied
her
even
the
witch
for
all
that
her
soul
was
given
to
mischief
was
much
moved
at
the
sight
and
sought
to
comfort
her
in
such
rude
fashion
as
she
knew
for
even
in
her
the
sight
of
such
beauty
and
virtue
moved
the
hidden
sense
of
womanhood
so
wiping
the
tears
from
the
damsel
s
eyes
she
bade
her
rest
awhile
this
she
was
nothing
loath
to
do
and
sat
down
upon
the
dusty
floor
as
a
bird
spent
with
tempest
cowers
upon
the
ground
after
a
while
she
began
to
set
aright
the
garments
that
she
wore
and
to
put
in
order
her
golden
hair
all
this
the
witch
woman
saw
with
wonder
that
still
waxed
greater
and
greater
is
this
a
mortal
maid
she
said
to
herself
or
one
of
diana
s
train
this
same
witch
woman
had
a
son
very
dear
to
her
and
in
a
sort
the
comfort
of
her
age
but
a
lazy
loon
always
idling
away
his
time
and
loath
to
follow
any
honest
trade
he
was
abroad
when
florimell
came
to
the
cottage
and
when
he
returned
he
was
not
a
little
amazed
to
see
so
fair
a
creature
sitting
by
his
mother
s
hearth
but
the
maiden
bore
herself
so
meekly
fitting
herself
to
the
low
condition
of
the
place
that
she
soon
ceased
to
be
strange
to
mother
and
son
this
was
a
thing
to
be
desired
yet
it
had
in
it
this
discomfort
that
the
witch
s
son
began
to
love
her
he
would
bring
gifts
for
her
such
as
birds
which
he
taught
to
speak
her
name
and
squirrels
which
he
said
were
as
with
himself
and
flowers
to
make
garlands
for
her
head
all
these
she
graciously
received
nevertheless
she
was
not
a
little
troubled
in
her
heart
for
she
could
not
but
perceive
the
love
which
the
young
man
bore
her
therefore
she
determined
in
herself
to
depart
by
this
time
her
palfrey
was
well
rested
from
its
weariness
for
indeed
the
young
man
the
son
of
the
witch
had
tended
it
with
all
care
early
therefore
one
morning
she
put
its
strappings
on
the
beast
and
so
departed
great
was
the
anger
of
the
witch
and
her
son
when
they
knew
that
florimell
was
gone
as
for
the
disappointed
lover
his
fury
passed
all
bounds
he
beat
upon
his
breast
and
scratched
his
face
and
tore
his
flesh
with
his
teeth
when
his
mother
saw
him
in
so
evil
a
plight
she
did
all
that
she
could
to
comfort
him
tears
and
prayers
she
used
and
charms
and
herbs
of
might
but
all
were
of
no
avail
when
she
saw
this
fearing
lest
in
his
despair
he
should
bring
himself
to
a
violent
end
she
said
within
herself
i
must
bring
the
creature
so
she
called
out
of
the
cave
a
hideous
beast
that
served
her
it
was
a
creature
likest
to
a
hyena
for
its
back
and
sides
were
covered
with
spots
but
never
was
seen
anything
that
could
be
matched
with
it
so
fierce
of
aspect
was
it
and
so
swift
the
witch
said
to
him
follow
this
woman
and
do
not
leave
following
till
you
so
the
monster
followed
florimell
and
as
she
rode
leisurely
soon
overtook
her
when
she
saw
him
she
set
spurs
to
her
palfrey
and
he
so
long
as
he
was
fresh
and
full
of
breath
kept
her
out
of
the
creature
s
reach
but
when
his
breath
failed
him
then
the
monster
drew
near
this
florimell
perceiving
leapt
from
her
saddle
and
fled
away
on
her
feet
now
it
chanced
that
she
was
close
to
the
seashore
and
she
being
minded
to
be
drowned
rather
than
be
overtaken
by
so
foul
a
beast
ran
to
the
very
edge
of
the
waves
there
by
good
hap
she
saw
a
little
shallop
lying
in
which
the
fisherman
an
old
man
and
poor
lay
asleep
the
while
his
nets
were
drying
into
this
she
leapt
and
pushing
off
the
shallop
with
an
oar
was
safe
awhile
the
monster
would
not
venture
on
the
sea
for
it
was
not
to
his
liking
and
so
set
out
to
return
to
his
mistress
the
witch
to
tell
her
how
his
quest
had
failed
but
first
he
turned
upon
the
palfrey
and
rent
it
scarcely
had
the
beast
done
this
when
there
came
that
way
a
gallant
knight
sir
satyrane
by
name
the
same
that
had
befriended
the
lady
una
in
her
distress
he
seeing
the
palfrey
lie
dead
upon
the
ground
knew
it
for
that
on
which
the
lady
florimell
had
been
wont
to
ride
also
he
found
the
golden
girdle
which
she
had
been
wont
to
wear
for
it
had
fallen
from
her
in
the
haste
of
her
flight
these
things
greatly
troubled
him
and
when
looking
round
he
also
saw
the
monstrous
beast
which
had
pursued
her
standing
by
his
fear
was
changed
to
anger
and
he
flew
upon
it
and
dealt
it
many
blows
with
all
his
might
many
wounds
did
he
give
it
causing
much
blood
to
pour
out
of
its
carcase
but
the
beast
he
subdued
not
with
such
spells
had
the
witch
woman
fortified
it
against
all
assault
at
the
last
he
threw
away
his
sword
for
in
truth
the
steel
seemed
to
avail
nothing
against
the
creature
s
hide
and
caught
it
in
his
arms
as
if
he
would
have
crushed
the
life
out
of
it
also
he
took
the
girdle
of
florimell
and
bound
the
beast
with
it
never
in
truth
had
it
known
such
constraint
for
in
a
moment
all
its
rage
was
quelled
and
it
followed
him
meek
as
a
lamb
which
the
shepherd
has
rescued
from
the
lion
s
mouth
and
this
without
doubt
it
had
continued
to
do
but
for
this
chance
that
sir
satyrane
was
called
away
upon
another
adventure
he
spied
a
giantess
riding
on
a
dappled
grey
steed
holding
before
her
a
squire
fast
bound
with
chains
of
wire
and
a
knight
pursuing
her
therefore
he
made
haste
to
put
himself
in
her
way
she
would
have
passed
him
by
but
he
would
not
suffer
it
running
at
her
with
his
spear
thereupon
she
was
constrained
to
deal
with
him
and
would
have
smitten
him
with
a
great
mace
of
iron
which
she
carried
in
her
hand
and
with
which
she
had
already
slain
not
a
few
but
ere
she
could
deal
the
blow
his
spear
came
full
upon
her
shield
so
great
was
the
shock
that
her
horse
staggered
to
and
fro
but
she
was
not
moved
one
whit
in
her
place
nor
was
the
shield
broken
rather
the
shaft
of
the
spear
was
shivered
on
it
for
all
it
was
big
and
strong
nor
did
she
delay
to
strike
him
with
the
mace
of
iron
full
on
his
helmet
s
crest
she
smote
him
and
that
so
sturdily
that
he
bowed
his
head
upon
his
breast
and
reeled
to
and
fro
like
to
a
drunken
man
which
the
giantess
perceiving
caught
him
in
her
arms
and
put
him
on
the
saddle
before
her
for
the
squire
she
had
already
cast
to
the
ground
then
truly
had
sir
satyrane
been
in
an
evil
plight
but
for
the
knight
that
was
pursuing
he
indeed
seeing
what
had
chanced
made
the
greater
haste
to
overtake
her
but
she
not
desiring
another
battle
or
because
she
especially
feared
the
other
knight
threw
sir
satyrane
to
the
ground
and
thus
he
was
delivered
but
meanwhile
the
witch
s
monster
had
departed
chapter
xxii
of
the
false
florimell
the
monster
sped
on
as
fast
as
it
could
to
the
dwelling
of
its
mistress
the
witch
woman
when
she
saw
it
she
perceived
how
it
was
bound
with
florimell
s
girdle
at
this
she
rejoiced
greatly
and
showed
the
thing
to
her
son
thinking
that
he
also
would
rejoice
see
said
she
this
thankless
creature
has
not
escaped
behold
her
but
he
was
otherwise
minded
surely
he
cried
she
is
dead
this
fairest
of
all
maidens
and
it
seemed
as
if
he
would
have
torn
the
very
heart
out
of
his
breast
so
mad
was
he
with
anger
and
grief
that
he
would
have
slain
his
mother
where
she
stood
only
she
hid
herself
in
a
secret
place
where
she
was
wont
to
call
up
the
evil
spirits
which
served
her
and
now
she
summoned
them
to
her
help
telling
them
what
had
come
to
pass
counsel
me
she
said
for
my
son
is
distraught
with
anger
and
grief
and
love
and
either
he
will
lay
violent
hands
on
himself
or
he
will
slay
me
though
i
have
done
my
very
best
to
serve
and
help
so
the
spirits
took
counsel
together
in
the
matter
and
by
their
advice
her
own
wicked
wit
helping
she
contrived
a
marvellous
thing
she
set
herself
to
make
another
florimell
a
false
maid
like
in
all
things
to
the
true
so
far
as
concerned
shape
and
outward
semblance
the
substance
of
which
she
made
her
was
snow
which
she
gathered
in
a
secret
glade
of
the
thracian
hills
the
spirits
of
the
mountains
having
revealed
to
her
the
place
this
snow
she
tempered
with
fine
mercury
and
virgin
wax
which
had
never
been
touched
with
fire
these
she
mingled
with
vermilion
so
making
a
rosy
red
in
the
cheeks
and
for
eyes
she
set
two
lamps
whose
fire
was
marvellously
attempered
to
the
likeness
of
life
and
hair
she
made
of
golden
wire
more
marvellously
light
than
ever
was
hair
of
woman
and
for
life
to
make
this
dead
mass
move
and
dead
it
was
for
all
its
put
one
of
the
spirits
which
served
her
a
wicked
spirit
was
this
none
more
wicked
or
crafty
or
with
a
more
cunning
art
to
take
the
semblance
of
goodness
there
was
no
need
to
teach
him
how
to
bear
himself
this
he
knew
already
there
was
no
subtlety
or
craft
in
all
the
wit
of
woman
with
which
he
was
not
acquainted
such
was
the
false
florimell
this
creature
she
arrayed
in
some
of
the
garments
which
the
true
florimell
had
left
behind
her
and
so
brought
her
to
her
son
where
he
lay
groaning
on
the
earth
see
my
son
she
said
the
maid
herself
has
come
back
to
and
when
he
saw
her
he
leapt
from
the
ground
and
would
have
caught
her
in
his
arms
but
she
held
back
for
the
spirit
within
her
knew
well
how
women
bear
themselves
in
such
a
case
neither
seeming
too
fond
yet
giving
such
encouragement
as
might
the
more
confirm
him
in
his
passion
such
was
the
charge
which
the
witch
woman
laid
upon
him
one
day
as
the
son
was
walking
with
the
false
florimell
in
the
wood
there
chanced
to
come
by
a
certain
knight
with
a
squire
attending
him
and
now
it
must
be
said
who
this
fellow
was
for
indeed
he
was
no
true
knight
it
has
been
already
told
how
that
sir
guyon
when
he
was
helping
a
traveller
in
distress
had
his
horse
and
his
spear
also
stolen
from
him
the
thing
was
done
by
a
vain
fellow
bragadocchio
by
name
who
seeing
the
horse
and
spear
ready
to
his
hand
thought
that
by
taking
them
he
might
make
himself
into
a
veritable
knight
little
had
he
of
his
own
but
a
ready
tongue
but
this
same
tongue
was
no
small
help
with
the
more
foolish
sort
he
then
mounting
the
steed
and
taking
the
spear
in
hand
rode
on
and
so
vain
was
he
and
full
of
that
he
hoped
to
be
courteously
received
for
what
he
seemed
to
be
and
in
this
notion
his
first
adventure
confirmed
him
as
he
rode
along
he
saw
a
man
sitting
idly
on
a
bank
and
he
said
to
himself
here
is
one
whom
i
will
make
captive
to
my
with
that
he
smote
his
steed
upon
the
flank
and
set
his
spear
in
rest
and
charged
the
man
when
he
saw
him
coming
on
fell
flat
on
the
ground
for
fear
and
cried
for
mercy
holding
up
his
hands
at
this
bragadocchio
took
a
wonderful
conceit
of
his
own
strength
and
courage
who
are
you
caitiff
he
cried
you
are
not
worthy
to
breathe
the
air
along
with
honest
men
prepare
for
death
or
yield
yourself
to
be
my
prisoner
for
ever
tis
no
small
favour
that
i
give
you
time
to
answer
the
man
cried
hold
your
hand
my
lord
i
am
your
thrall
so
be
it
said
the
sham
knight
your
fate
has
baulked
my
will
and
given
you
life
when
i
had
purposed
death
so
be
it
life
i
give
you
fall
on
the
ground
and
kiss
my
stirrup
so
pay
your
then
the
wretch
threw
himself
on
the
ground
and
kissed
the
stirrup
and
declared
himself
to
be
bragadocchio
s
man
for
a
while
he
held
his
master
in
great
respect
but
when
he
found
out
how
hollow
was
his
show
of
courage
then
he
grew
bolder
and
practised
upon
him
for
his
own
ends
trompart
was
his
name
which
being
interpreted
means
deceiver
a
worthy
squire
he
was
for
such
a
knight
they
had
not
long
companied
together
when
they
chanced
to
meet
archimage
who
was
looking
out
for
some
to
help
him
in
his
evil
designs
he
coming
close
to
trompart
said
to
him
under
his
breath
who
is
this
mighty
warrior
who
has
a
spear
only
and
no
sword
said
trompart
he
is
indeed
a
mighty
warrior
as
for
his
sword
he
has
made
a
vow
that
he
will
use
none
till
he
shall
be
avenged
for
a
certain
wrong
that
has
been
done
to
him
meanwhile
his
spear
is
enough
he
can
do
to
death
with
that
as
many
as
he
then
archimage
louting
low
before
him
told
a
false
tale
about
the
knight
and
sir
guyon
which
when
bragadocchio
had
heard
he
cried
with
a
loud
voice
old
man
tell
me
where
these
false
knights
are
hiding
themselves
i
will
soon
punish
them
for
all
their
that
will
i
do
without
delay
answered
archimage
and
will
help
you
also
when
you
come
to
deal
with
them
meanwhile
i
would
give
you
this
counsel
that
you
give
no
odds
to
your
adversaries
but
provide
yourself
with
a
sword
before
you
do
battle
with
them
for
indeed
they
are
sturdy
old
man
said
bragadocchio
you
dote
doubtless
your
wits
have
failed
you
by
reason
of
age
or
you
would
not
judge
of
a
man
by
his
coat
of
mail
or
his
sword
a
man
be
he
indeed
a
man
can
quell
a
host
without
sword
or
shield
little
do
you
know
what
this
right
hand
of
mine
has
achieved
but
they
who
have
seen
it
can
tell
if
they
not
a
little
abashed
was
archimage
at
these
high
words
well
he
knew
in
his
heart
that
whoso
should
do
battle
with
the
knight
or
sir
guyon
would
need
all
his
arms
and
yet
he
feared
to
offend
this
knight
then
bragadocchio
said
further
once
upon
a
time
i
slew
seven
knights
with
one
sword
and
i
took
a
great
oath
having
done
this
never
again
to
use
a
sword
in
battle
unless
it
should
be
the
sword
of
the
very
noblest
knight
in
all
the
wait
you
for
that
said
archimage
then
you
shall
have
it
by
at
this
time
tis
the
sword
of
prince
arthur
and
it
flames
like
a
burning
fire
lo
i
go
to
fetch
and
as
he
spoke
he
vanished
into
air
what
is
this
thought
the
two
to
themselves
in
sore
dismay
for
they
liked
little
to
have
aught
to
do
with
such
a
sword
and
they
fled
from
the
place
as
fast
as
they
could
to
hide
themselves
in
a
wood
which
was
near
at
hand
this
they
had
scarcely
reached
when
they
heard
the
clear
ringing
of
a
horn
thereupon
bragadocchio
leapt
from
his
horse
and
hid
his
coward
head
in
a
thicket
as
for
trompart
he
was
not
easily
moved
but
abode
in
his
place
to
see
what
should
happen
soon
there
came
into
the
glade
where
they
were
a
very
fair
lady
dressed
in
huntress
fashion
she
had
a
fair
white
tunic
with
an
edge
of
gold
and
gilded
buskins
and
a
in
her
hand
and
on
her
shoulder
a
bow
and
a
quiver
filled
with
arrows
and
all
about
them
flowed
loosely
down
her
golden
hair
when
she
spied
trompart
she
said
saw
you
a
hind
with
an
arrow
in
her
right
haunch
if
so
tell
me
which
way
she
went
that
i
may
follow
up
the
but
while
she
was
speaking
she
saw
the
bush
stir
in
which
bragadocchio
lay
hid
and
thinking
it
was
some
beast
of
prey
would
have
shot
an
arrow
into
it
but
trompart
cried
forbear
i
pray
you
whether
you
be
nymph
or
mortal
maid
that
is
no
mark
for
your
arrows
my
master
a
famous
knight
rests
awhile
under
the
so
she
stayed
her
hand
and
bragadocchio
came
forth
from
his
on
his
hands
and
knees
and
after
stood
up
making
as
if
he
had
been
newly
roused
from
sleep
after
this
they
talked
awhile
and
when
the
lady
had
passed
on
bragadocchio
said
to
trompart
i
had
from
my
birth
this
grace
not
to
fear
any
mortal
thing
but
of
the
heavenly
powers
and
of
the
fiends
in
hell
i
do
stand
i
do
honestly
confess
in
great
dread
and
when
i
heard
that
horn
i
took
it
for
some
signal
from
the
sky
and
hid
myself
for
fear
and
now
let
us
depart
such
was
bragadocchio
the
false
knight
who
came
upon
the
son
of
the
witch
woman
as
he
was
walking
in
the
wood
with
the
false
florimell
when
he
saw
the
two
and
perceived
that
the
lady
was
very
fair
to
look
upon
and
that
he
who
was
with
her
was
no
man
of
war
he
rode
up
with
his
spear
in
rest
crying
clown
how
is
this
this
lady
is
my
love
gainsay
it
if
you
dare
the
churl
dare
not
answer
him
a
word
but
yielded
the
damsel
to
him
and
he
mounting
her
upon
trompart
s
horse
rode
on
not
a
little
proud
of
the
valiant
deed
which
he
had
done
nor
had
he
ridden
long
when
there
came
in
view
a
stranger
knight
who
cried
ho
there
yield
the
damsel
to
me
i
have
a
better
right
than
you
sorely
dismayed
was
bragadocchio
at
such
a
challenge
but
dissembled
his
fear
saying
think
you
sir
knight
to
steal
away
with
words
what
i
have
won
by
many
blows
yet
if
you
will
have
trial
of
my
strength
or
prove
your
own
let
it
be
turn
your
horse
said
the
stranger
or
i
will
strike
you
dead
so
be
it
answered
bragadocchio
if
nothing
else
will
content
you
let
us
then
retire
our
horses
for
a
furlong
either
way
and
tilt
together
as
is
the
so
they
turned
their
horses
and
retired
each
a
furlong
s
length
but
bragadocchio
came
not
again
but
fled
away
as
fast
as
his
horse
could
carry
him
chapter
xxiii
sir
satyrane
s
tournament
by
sundry
adventures
which
there
is
no
need
to
set
forth
in
their
place
the
girdle
of
florimell
came
into
the
possession
of
sir
satyrane
who
forthwith
resolved
to
hold
in
honour
of
it
a
great
tournament
in
this
same
tournament
there
should
be
so
he
proclaimed
two
contests
first
a
contest
of
knights
who
should
joust
with
each
other
so
showing
who
excelled
in
strength
and
courage
second
a
contest
of
fair
ladies
she
who
should
most
fittingly
wear
the
said
girdle
being
adjudged
the
most
excellent
the
beginning
of
the
tournament
was
that
sir
satyrane
came
forth
from
his
pavilion
holding
in
his
hands
an
ark
of
gold
this
ark
he
opened
with
much
solemnity
and
drew
forth
from
it
the
girdle
a
wondrously
fair
thing
it
was
curiously
embossed
with
pearls
and
precious
stones
they
were
all
costly
things
but
the
workmanship
was
costlier
yet
this
he
held
up
for
the
general
view
and
all
eyes
were
drawn
to
it
for
indeed
it
was
a
thing
greatly
to
be
admired
nor
was
there
one
in
all
that
company
but
said
in
his
heart
happy
the
knight
who
shall
win
so
fair
a
prize
happy
the
dame
who
shall
be
deemed
to
wear
it
most
the
girdle
having
been
thus
displayed
in
the
sight
of
all
the
concourse
the
knights
disposed
themselves
for
the
jousting
and
first
of
all
sir
satyrane
came
forth
holding
in
his
hand
the
great
spear
which
he
was
wont
to
wield
no
man
in
those
days
bore
one
greater
or
indeed
so
great
he
was
the
challenger
and
it
became
him
thus
to
be
first
in
the
field
behind
him
were
ranged
the
knights
of
fairyland
owning
allegiance
all
of
them
to
the
great
queen
gloriana
on
the
other
side
was
ranged
a
great
company
of
knights
who
had
come
from
all
parts
first
of
these
rode
up
a
pagan
knight
sir
bruncheval
surnamed
the
bold
he
jousted
with
sir
satyrane
whose
mastery
of
arms
had
been
tried
in
many
battles
fierce
was
their
onset
so
fierce
that
neither
could
resist
the
other
but
both
were
tumbled
on
the
plain
holding
indeed
their
spears
in
their
hands
but
not
able
to
move
them
so
much
as
a
hair
when
sir
ferramont
saw
his
leader
in
this
plight
he
set
spurs
to
his
horse
and
rode
forth
against
him
came
out
sir
blandamour
putting
all
his
strength
into
his
stroke
but
his
strength
availed
him
nothing
for
he
was
tumbled
on
the
ground
he
and
his
horse
together
and
when
sir
paridell
rode
forth
to
his
rescue
he
fared
no
better
the
next
in
turn
to
contend
was
bragadocchio
but
the
thing
was
not
to
his
liking
and
he
stood
still
in
doubt
what
he
should
do
or
rather
in
fear
thereupon
sir
triamond
vexed
indeed
that
a
knight
should
bear
himself
so
basely
but
rejoicing
in
the
occasion
rode
forth
with
his
spear
in
rest
and
charged
on
sir
ferramont
with
all
his
might
so
sure
was
the
stroke
that
both
man
and
horse
were
laid
prostrate
on
the
ground
nor
could
they
lift
themselves
again
for
a
space
and
when
sir
devon
rode
forth
from
the
fairyland
array
he
fared
no
better
nor
did
sir
douglas
nor
sir
palimord
when
in
turn
they
made
trial
of
him
either
they
were
stretched
on
the
plain
or
went
sorely
wounded
by
this
time
sir
satyrane
had
woke
out
of
the
swoon
in
which
he
had
lain
so
long
looking
round
he
was
sorely
dismayed
to
see
the
havoc
which
sir
triamond
had
wrought
among
the
knights
of
queen
gloriana
truly
he
said
to
himself
i
had
rather
been
dead
than
laid
here
helpless
while
such
deeds
were
then
gathering
strength
he
laid
hold
of
his
spear
which
lay
close
beside
him
his
horse
also
by
good
fortune
was
at
hand
mounting
therefore
he
rode
forth
again
to
where
the
brave
triamond
was
carrying
all
before
him
not
a
man
could
stand
up
against
him
so
heavy
were
his
strokes
so
deadly
was
his
hand
but
now
there
came
a
stay
to
his
achievements
sir
satyrane
smote
him
on
the
side
with
his
great
spear
and
the
point
made
a
most
grievous
wound
so
grievous
was
it
that
though
he
was
not
forthwith
overthrown
he
was
fain
to
withdraw
himself
from
the
field
then
the
challengers
ranged
over
the
lists
claiming
to
be
conquerors
and
indeed
no
one
was
ready
to
take
them
in
hand
and
now
the
night
fell
and
the
trumpets
sounded
a
retreat
that
day
therefore
sir
satyrane
was
adjudged
to
have
won
the
prize
on
the
second
day
of
the
tournament
sir
satyrane
rode
forth
with
queen
gloriana
s
knights
following
him
to
challenge
all
comers
and
on
the
other
side
also
were
many
famous
warriors
eager
all
of
them
to
win
the
prize
for
himself
but
sir
triamond
was
not
one
of
these
his
wound
was
so
grievous
that
it
hindered
him
from
making
a
trial
of
arms
so
he
was
constrained
to
stand
aside
but
it
grieved
him
sorely
this
his
close
friend
sir
cambell
perceiving
said
to
himself
i
can
not
cure
his
hurt
nor
undo
the
thing
which
has
been
done
but
this
i
can
do
i
can
win
honour
for
therefore
he
took
sir
triamond
s
arms
none
knowing
neither
sir
triamond
himself
nor
anyone
else
for
he
said
to
himself
if
i
fare
ill
in
this
matter
the
blame
will
not
fall
on
my
he
went
therefore
to
fight
no
one
doubting
that
he
was
the
veritable
triamond
when
he
was
come
he
found
sir
satyrane
full
of
joy
and
triumph
for
no
one
was
able
to
stand
up
against
him
at
him
therefore
he
charged
with
his
spear
in
rest
nor
did
sir
satyrane
on
his
part
draw
back
from
the
encounter
with
so
great
a
shock
did
they
meet
that
both
were
driven
from
their
saddles
to
the
ground
rising
therefore
they
drew
both
of
them
their
swords
and
fought
therewith
such
a
fight
as
had
scarce
been
seen
before
in
that
land
and
now
sir
satyrane
s
horse
for
by
this
time
they
had
both
again
mounted
their
steeds
chanced
to
stumble
so
that
his
rider
was
cast
to
the
ground
this
sir
cambell
perceiving
was
not
slow
to
seize
the
occasion
but
dealt
him
so
sore
a
blow
on
the
crest
of
his
helmet
that
he
fell
to
the
ground
then
sir
cambell
leapt
from
his
steed
and
would
have
spoiled
him
of
his
arms
but
this
which
indeed
is
a
custom
of
the
battlefield
rather
than
of
the
tourney
the
knights
who
were
of
sir
satyrane
s
party
would
not
suffer
hastening
to
their
comrade
s
help
they
closed
his
adversary
in
so
close
a
ring
that
though
he
laid
about
him
most
bravely
yet
could
he
not
deliver
what
could
one
against
so
many
so
he
was
taken
prisoner
and
led
away
it
chanced
somehow
that
the
news
of
what
had
befallen
sir
cambell
came
to
sir
triamond
where
he
lay
in
his
bed
in
a
moment
of
time
he
leapt
therefrom
wholly
forgetting
his
wound
and
sought
for
his
armour
he
sought
but
he
found
it
not
for
indeed
cambell
was
wearing
it
at
the
very
time
but
the
arms
and
armour
of
sir
cambell
he
found
these
he
donned
without
delay
and
issued
forth
to
take
such
chance
as
might
befall
him
there
he
saw
his
friend
and
companion
cambell
as
he
was
led
away
captive
in
the
midst
of
a
great
press
of
knights
and
the
sight
moved
him
to
great
wrath
he
thrust
himself
into
the
thickest
of
the
press
and
smote
down
all
that
were
in
his
way
till
he
came
to
where
cambell
was
led
a
prisoner
between
two
knights
fiercely
did
he
assail
these
two
and
they
for
their
own
lives
sake
were
constrained
to
let
him
go
then
he
seizing
a
sword
from
one
of
them
laid
about
him
with
all
his
might
for
both
his
own
wrong
and
the
wounding
of
his
friend
stirred
a
great
wrath
in
him
so
these
two
made
great
havoc
over
all
the
field
till
the
trumpet
sounded
the
end
of
the
battle
for
that
day
by
common
consent
the
prize
of
the
day
was
adjudged
to
these
two
cambell
and
triamond
but
to
which
of
the
two
was
doubtful
for
they
strove
together
each
advancing
the
other
s
cause
so
that
the
matter
was
postponed
on
the
third
and
last
day
of
the
tournament
many
valiant
deeds
were
done
not
without
great
hurt
and
damage
to
many
that
contended
in
the
field
there
might
be
seen
that
day
full
many
a
shivered
shield
and
swords
strewn
upon
the
ground
horses
also
running
loose
without
their
riders
and
squires
helping
their
lords
who
were
in
evil
plight
but
for
the
most
part
the
knights
of
the
queen
fared
the
better
and
among
the
knights
there
was
not
one
that
fought
with
better
success
than
the
brave
sir
satyrane
now
and
again
his
fortune
failed
him
but
ever
it
returned
again
and
he
was
the
best
stay
and
support
of
his
side
but
when
it
was
now
past
noon
there
came
forth
from
the
other
side
a
strange
knight
whom
no
one
knew
strange
he
was
and
strange
was
his
disguise
for
all
his
armour
was
covered
with
moss
from
the
wood
and
his
horse
had
trappings
of
oak
leaves
and
on
his
shield
which
had
ragged
edges
was
written
this
motto
sans
he
as
soon
as
he
had
come
upon
the
field
charged
the
first
knight
that
was
in
his
way
this
was
the
stout
sir
sanglier
a
valiant
man
well
approved
in
many
battles
but
now
he
was
laid
low
at
the
very
first
encounter
and
after
him
sir
brianor
came
to
a
worse
fate
for
he
was
killed
outright
seven
knights
one
after
the
other
he
overthrew
and
when
his
spear
was
broken
then
he
worked
no
less
damage
with
his
sword
shields
and
helmets
he
broke
through
and
wasted
all
the
array
of
knights
as
a
lion
wastes
a
flock
of
sheep
so
satyrane
and
his
party
were
turned
to
flight
for
indeed
no
man
could
stand
before
him
and
when
they
would
find
out
his
name
no
one
knew
it
so
that
they
were
constrained
to
call
him
the
savage
knight
but
he
was
in
truth
sir
artegall
it
was
said
by
a
wise
man
of
old
time
that
no
man
should
be
accounted
happy
before
the
end
because
it
can
not
be
known
what
change
of
fortune
may
befall
him
and
so
it
proved
that
day
with
sir
artegall
for
when
the
sun
was
laid
low
in
the
heavens
but
before
the
trumpet
had
sounded
there
came
forth
from
the
ranks
of
the
queen
s
knights
a
stranger
first
he
charged
at
sir
artegall
and
tumbled
him
backwards
over
his
horse
s
tail
with
so
heavy
a
fall
that
he
had
small
desire
to
rise
again
this
when
sir
cambell
saw
he
charged
with
all
his
might
and
he
too
could
be
seen
lying
on
the
plain
in
like
manner
fared
sir
triamond
when
he
would
have
avenged
his
friend
s
disgrace
nor
did
sir
blandamour
succeed
where
these
had
failed
many
another
famous
knight
was
overthrown
that
day
yet
without
loss
of
honour
for
they
had
to
yield
to
the
enchanted
spear
of
britomart
so
when
the
trumpet
sounded
on
the
third
day
of
sir
satyrane
s
great
tournament
the
honour
rested
with
the
knights
of
queen
gloriana
chapter
xxiv
of
florimell
s
girdle
the
tournament
being
ended
the
next
thing
in
order
to
be
done
was
to
adjudge
the
prizes
for
the
first
day
the
prize
was
given
to
sir
satyrane
as
has
been
told
before
because
having
been
first
at
the
beginning
he
was
also
first
at
the
end
for
the
second
day
sir
triamond
was
held
to
have
excelled
all
others
cambell
indeed
was
victor
but
then
triamond
had
saved
him
from
imprisonment
and
he
who
saves
the
victor
is
without
controversy
first
of
all
for
the
third
day
the
prize
was
adjudged
to
britomart
or
as
men
called
her
the
knight
of
the
ebony
spear
for
who
she
was
in
truth
no
one
knew
nor
could
this
judgment
be
disputed
for
whereas
the
savage
knight
had
overthrown
all
others
so
was
he
overthrown
by
her
and
this
third
prize
was
held
to
be
the
most
honourable
of
all
and
the
knight
to
whom
it
was
given
the
first
of
all
and
because
by
good
right
beauty
and
valour
go
together
there
must
needs
be
a
trial
of
the
dames
who
should
be
reckoned
the
fairest
with
the
girdle
of
florimell
for
prize
first
came
sir
cambell
leading
his
wife
the
fair
cambina
clad
in
a
veil
which
covered
her
from
head
to
foot
which
being
taken
away
such
was
her
beauty
that
all
hearts
were
won
nevertheless
when
sir
triamond
coming
next
showed
his
wife
canacé
they
were
not
less
moved
by
the
sight
and
some
greatly
admired
the
false
duessa
when
sir
paridell
led
her
forth
before
the
company
for
some
hearts
are
moved
by
one
thing
and
some
by
another
nor
did
the
lady
lucida
whose
champion
was
sir
ferramont
want
for
worshippers
nor
indeed
did
any
one
of
the
hundred
dames
assembled
in
that
place
lack
some
to
champion
her
yet
doubtless
the
great
number
of
the
votes
had
been
given
to
amoret
when
britomart
led
her
forth
but
that
she
also
was
surpassed
in
the
common
judgment
by
sir
blandamour
s
florimell
not
the
true
florimell
it
must
be
understood
but
the
false
which
the
witch
woman
had
made
for
in
comparison
of
her
all
others
seemed
but
base
even
as
the
stars
seem
to
grow
dull
when
the
moon
is
shining
at
her
full
this
said
they
all
is
no
mortal
creature
but
an
angel
from
even
so
when
some
cunning
smith
overlays
base
metal
with
covering
of
gold
he
lays
upon
it
so
fair
a
gloss
that
it
seems
to
surpass
the
true
gold
itself
so
they
who
had
looked
upon
the
true
florimell
thought
to
themselves
the
dame
is
fairer
than
ever
before
for
ever
it
is
that
false
things
do
seem
to
excel
the
true
so
weak
and
false
are
the
judgments
of
men
then
by
common
consent
the
girdle
was
adjudged
to
her
as
being
the
fairest
of
all
but
lo
when
they
thought
to
bind
it
round
her
waist
they
could
not
prevail
to
do
it
so
soon
as
they
fastened
it
it
seemed
to
loose
itself
and
fall
away
as
if
there
was
some
secret
hindrance
and
want
of
fitness
and
so
it
fared
with
many
other
dames
when
they
assayed
the
same
when
they
would
have
girt
the
thing
about
their
waists
they
could
not
however
fast
it
seemed
to
be
it
was
soon
seen
to
be
loose
then
a
certain
squire
who
thought
scorn
of
women
cried
aloud
surely
this
is
a
sorrowful
sight
that
out
of
so
many
fair
dames
not
one
can
fit
to
herself
the
girdle
of
beauty
shame
on
the
man
who
thought
of
this
fatal
device
may
he
never
find
fair
lady
to
love
him
at
which
saying
all
the
knights
laughed
loud
and
all
the
ladies
frowned
and
now
the
gentle
amoret
coming
last
of
all
that
company
took
the
girdle
in
her
hands
and
put
it
around
her
waist
and
lo
it
fitted
to
a
marvel
but
the
false
florimell
snatched
it
away
as
if
in
anger
and
would
have
clasped
it
round
her
own
waist
she
clasped
it
but
it
fitted
as
ill
as
before
nevertheless
it
was
adjudged
to
her
as
her
right
for
such
the
common
voice
had
been
and
she
herself
was
assigned
to
the
knight
of
the
ebony
spear
that
is
to
britomart
but
she
was
nay
nay
she
said
all
thinking
that
it
was
the
knight
of
the
ebony
spear
that
spoke
i
am
no
light
of
love
i
am
still
steadfast
to
my
own
then
she
was
adjudged
to
the
savage
knight
but
he
had
already
departed
in
great
wrath
and
then
to
triamond
but
he
was
faithful
to
his
canacé
and
after
triamond
to
sir
satyrane
he
indeed
was
well
content
but
then
arose
great
strife
and
like
enough
there
had
been
a
drawing
of
swords
but
for
this
strange
happening
sir
satyrane
stood
forth
and
said
surely
we
have
had
enough
of
battles
why
should
we
fight
again
the
old
quarrels
let
the
fair
lady
choose
for
herself
surely
the
love
that
comes
of
her
will
is
the
sweetest
of
all
to
this
they
all
consented
and
so
the
choice
was
given
to
the
false
florimell
long
looked
she
upon
each
gallant
knight
for
it
seemed
as
if
she
would
willingly
have
pleased
them
all
but
at
the
last
she
turned
to
bragadocchio
for
he
also
stood
among
the
rest
and
said
this
is
the
man
i
choose
great
was
the
wrath
of
all
the
company
of
knights
for
they
knew
not
how
fitting
it
was
that
the
false
beauty
should
choose
the
valour
that
was
false
chapter
xxv
of
britomart
and
artegall
britomart
grew
not
a
little
weary
of
these
strivings
of
knights
and
dames
therefore
she
departed
taking
with
her
the
lady
amoret
for
she
was
still
bent
on
finding
the
knight
of
the
mirror
an
unlucky
maid
she
was
in
truth
thus
seeking
one
who
had
been
her
adversary
to
whom
she
had
been
so
near
though
she
knew
it
not
great
was
her
grief
and
great
also
her
toil
for
neither
grief
nor
toil
did
she
spare
thinking
that
could
she
find
him
there
would
be
both
an
end
of
her
own
toil
and
a
solace
for
her
grief
the
gentle
amoret
also
who
was
her
companion
had
a
sorrow
of
her
own
for
she
sought
for
her
scudamore
but
he
unhappy
man
had
his
heart
full
of
hatred
and
revenge
for
that
evil
hag
whose
name
was
até
or
strife
had
poisoned
it
with
suspicion
the
very
one
who
had
best
served
him
he
hated
most
even
britomart
neither
could
glaucé
for
she
went
with
him
serving
him
as
a
squire
abate
his
rage
for
all
that
she
could
say
and
now
as
though
the
evil
counsels
of
strife
had
not
wrought
trouble
enough
for
him
he
must
needs
put
another
burden
on
his
soul
as
they
journeyed
on
the
night
came
upon
them
unawares
very
heavy
with
cloud
and
rain
they
seeking
some
place
where
they
might
find
shelter
perceived
upon
a
steep
hillside
what
seemed
to
be
a
poor
man
s
cottage
and
underneath
there
ran
a
little
stream
but
the
water
was
muddy
and
thick
and
had
an
evil
smell
as
they
came
near
they
heard
the
sound
of
hammers
and
judged
that
it
must
be
a
blacksmith
s
forge
entering
in
they
found
the
goodman
of
the
place
busy
with
his
work
he
was
of
a
mean
and
wretched
aspect
spent
it
would
seem
with
weariness
his
eyes
were
hollow
and
his
cheeks
fallen
in
like
to
one
who
had
been
many
months
in
a
prison
cell
his
face
was
begrimed
with
smoke
and
his
beard
ragged
as
if
neither
comb
nor
shears
had
ever
passed
upon
it
rude
were
his
garments
and
hanging
in
rags
and
his
hands
were
blistered
with
burning
with
nails
long
left
unpared
care
was
his
name
and
his
trade
was
the
working
of
wedges
of
iron
to
what
purpose
they
could
serve
neither
he
nor
anyone
knew
such
are
the
idle
doubts
and
fears
which
care
drives
into
the
hearts
of
men
nor
was
it
he
alone
that
was
busy
with
this
toil
six
stout
workers
stood
about
the
forge
all
with
huge
hammers
in
their
hands
which
they
plied
in
order
much
did
sir
scudamore
wonder
to
see
their
work
but
when
he
had
watched
it
awhile
he
asked
them
of
its
purpose
saying
what
make
you
but
they
answered
not
a
word
nor
did
they
hold
their
hands
for
a
moment
the
bellows
blew
like
to
a
cold
blast
from
the
north
and
the
din
of
the
hammers
ceased
not
when
the
knight
saw
that
no
one
answered
he
laid
himself
down
upon
the
floor
seeking
to
rest
his
weary
limbs
glaucé
did
the
like
and
sore
was
her
need
of
rest
for
she
was
old
and
feeble
and
they
had
journeyed
that
day
a
long
and
weary
way
she
slept
indeed
but
to
sir
scudamore
there
came
no
sleeping
now
he
would
lie
on
this
side
now
on
that
now
he
lay
in
one
place
now
in
another
anon
he
would
rise
from
his
place
and
then
lie
down
again
but
every
change
was
to
no
purpose
and
every
place
seemed
full
of
pain
also
the
dogs
howled
and
barked
all
the
night
long
and
the
cocks
crowed
and
the
owls
hooted
and
if
by
chance
slumber
came
down
upon
his
eyes
then
one
of
the
workers
smote
his
headpiece
with
a
hammer
for
they
indeed
rested
not
all
the
night
as
morning
drew
near
he
fell
into
a
sleep
so
utterly
wearied
was
he
but
sleep
was
worse
than
waking
for
it
brought
evil
thoughts
of
those
whom
he
was
most
bound
to
love
and
trust
the
next
day
sir
scudamore
and
glaucé
serving
him
as
his
squire
started
betimes
from
the
house
of
care
for
his
was
the
dwelling
where
they
had
spent
the
night
after
a
while
they
espied
a
knight
sitting
beside
a
wood
while
his
horse
grazed
in
the
field
hard
by
the
man
mounted
so
soon
as
he
saw
them
and
rode
forward
as
did
also
sir
scudamore
but
when
the
two
were
near
enough
that
each
could
discern
what
arms
the
other
wore
the
knight
of
the
wood
lowered
his
spear
and
turned
his
horse
aside
saying
gentle
scudamore
pardon
me
i
pray
you
that
i
had
unknowingly
almost
trespassed
against
you
i
blame
you
not
answered
sir
scudamore
such
happenings
may
well
be
to
knights
who
seek
for
adventures
but
sir
as
you
call
me
by
my
name
may
i
be
bold
enough
to
ask
you
yours
the
other
made
answer
i
pray
you
pardon
me
if
i
withhold
my
name
for
a
time
the
time
serves
not
that
i
should
make
it
known
may
it
please
you
to
call
me
the
for
thus
i
am
commonly
sir
scudamore
said
this
place
seems
to
suit
well
the
arms
which
you
are
pleased
to
wear
but
tell
me
have
you
any
special
purpose
to
serve
that
you
abide
in
this
place
sir
replied
the
other
be
it
known
to
you
that
a
stranger
knight
did
me
but
the
other
day
a
great
shame
and
dishonour
and
i
wait
till
i
can
take
vengeance
on
tell
me
answered
sir
scudamore
who
it
is
that
wronged
his
name
said
the
savage
knight
is
unknown
yet
he
himself
is
known
to
many
especially
by
the
ebony
spear
which
he
carries
it
was
but
the
other
day
that
with
this
spear
he
overthrew
all
that
met
him
in
the
tourney
and
reft
from
me
the
honour
of
the
day
not
only
so
for
of
these
things
a
knight
may
not
complain
but
he
took
from
me
the
fairest
lady
that
ever
was
and
withholds
her
then
sir
scudamore
knew
that
he
spoke
of
britomart
who
as
he
thought
had
taken
from
him
his
love
all
his
heart
was
full
of
rage
and
he
cried
out
now
by
my
head
this
is
not
the
first
time
of
this
knight
s
playing
an
unknightly
part
for
i
know
him
by
this
same
spear
which
he
bears
from
me
also
did
he
carry
away
my
love
if
you
purpose
to
take
vengeance
on
him
i
will
give
you
all
the
help
that
i
so
these
two
agreed
to
join
together
in
wreaking
their
wrath
on
the
knight
of
the
ebony
spear
that
is
to
say
on
britomart
while
they
were
communing
together
on
this
matter
they
saw
in
the
distance
a
knight
riding
slowly
towards
them
somewhat
strangely
attired
and
bearing
strange
arms
whom
approaching
they
perceived
to
be
the
very
one
of
whom
they
were
speaking
then
said
sir
scudamore
i
beseech
you
sir
savage
knight
that
as
i
was
first
wronged
so
i
may
first
take
vengeance
and
if
i
fail
then
the
lot
comes
to
illustration
sir
scudamore
overthrown
by
britomart
to
this
the
other
gave
his
assent
thereupon
sir
scudamore
charged
at
her
with
all
his
might
and
at
his
horse
s
top
speed
which
she
perceiving
made
herself
ready
and
gave
him
so
rough
a
welcome
that
she
smote
to
the
ground
both
horse
and
man
and
this
so
strongly
that
neither
had
any
mind
to
rise
therefrom
this
sir
artegall
perceiving
felt
in
himself
a
yet
greater
anger
than
before
and
laying
his
lance
in
rest
charged
also
with
all
his
strength
but
he
also
was
laid
upon
the
ground
for
there
was
nothing
that
could
withstand
the
enchanted
spear
nevertheless
he
fared
better
than
his
fellow
in
that
he
rose
lightly
from
the
ground
and
drawing
his
sword
leapt
fiercely
at
his
adversary
so
sore
were
his
strokes
that
though
she
was
on
horseback
she
was
constrained
to
give
place
before
him
as
they
turned
this
way
and
that
it
chanced
that
a
blow
which
sir
artegall
aimed
at
the
princess
glancing
down
the
corslet
which
she
wore
lighted
on
the
back
of
her
horse
wounding
him
so
sorely
upon
the
back
in
the
rear
of
the
saddle
that
she
was
compelled
to
alight
not
a
whit
was
she
dismayed
at
this
mischance
and
casting
down
her
enchanted
spear
betook
herself
to
use
sword
and
shield
and
now
the
fortune
of
the
fight
changed
somewhat
for
he
was
not
a
little
spent
by
long
fighting
on
foot
and
she
having
been
mounted
hitherto
had
the
advantage
hence
it
followed
that
she
drove
him
backwards
and
even
so
heavy
were
her
blows
wounded
him
through
his
coat
of
mail
and
now
behold
another
change
she
was
in
her
assault
and
her
breath
began
to
fail
and
he
on
the
other
hand
reserved
his
strength
and
dealt
his
blows
as
thick
as
the
hailstones
fall
upon
a
man
who
came
so
near
to
slaying
the
fairest
creature
in
all
the
world
still
was
the
battle
waged
between
these
two
but
ever
sir
artegall
grew
the
stronger
and
britomart
the
weaker
at
last
he
dealt
a
stroke
that
had
it
been
aimed
aright
had
surely
gone
near
to
slay
her
but
by
good
chance
it
did
but
shear
away
the
visor
of
her
helmet
so
that
her
face
could
plainly
be
seen
somewhat
reddened
indeed
by
long
toil
and
with
the
sweat
standing
on
it
in
great
drops
but
yet
fair
beyond
all
comparison
and
at
the
same
time
her
hair
its
band
being
broken
fell
down
as
it
were
a
river
of
gold
flowing
about
her
already
had
the
knight
lifted
his
hand
to
strike
again
but
when
he
saw
the
fair
face
and
golden
hair
his
arm
was
as
it
were
benumbed
his
sword
dropped
from
his
hand
and
he
himself
fell
upon
his
knees
surely
he
said
to
himself
this
is
some
goddess
that
i
see
before
she
stood
indeed
in
great
wrath
for
she
had
been
in
sore
straits
and
anger
ever
follows
close
on
fear
and
made
as
if
she
would
strike
him
but
he
could
do
nothing
but
ask
for
pardon
nor
was
sir
scudamore
less
amazed
for
he
had
by
this
time
recovered
from
his
swoon
when
he
saw
the
sight
and
now
glaucé
glad
at
heart
to
see
again
the
mistress
whom
she
had
missed
so
long
drew
near
and
made
her
a
reverence
saying
truly
i
rejoice
to
see
you
safe
after
so
many
toils
and
dangers
and
now
dear
daughter
as
you
love
me
grant
these
knights
a
so
be
it
britomart
made
answer
thereupon
they
lifted
up
their
visors
so
that
their
faces
could
be
seen
and
when
britomart
looked
on
the
face
of
artegall
behold
it
was
the
very
countenance
of
the
knight
whom
she
had
seen
long
since
in
the
magic
mirror
and
as
she
saw
it
her
haughty
spirit
abated
she
could
never
again
lift
hand
against
him
nay
when
she
thought
to
use
her
tongue
and
reproach
him
with
angry
words
even
her
tongue
failed
her
and
now
sir
scudamore
greatly
rejoiced
to
know
that
all
his
fears
and
suspicions
were
false
drew
near
and
said
surely
it
makes
me
glad
sir
artegall
to
see
you
who
were
wont
to
despise
all
dames
bow
yourself
before
one
in
so
lowly
a
and
when
britomart
heard
the
name
of
artegall
her
heart
leaped
within
her
breast
nor
for
all
her
feigning
could
she
hide
the
gladness
which
she
felt
then
said
glaucé
again
gentle
knights
be
thankful
for
the
happy
chance
which
has
brought
so
strange
an
ending
to
your
fears
and
troubles
here
is
no
thief
that
would
take
away
from
you
the
ladies
whom
you
love
and
you
sir
artegall
who
call
yourself
the
savage
knight
count
it
no
shame
that
a
maid
has
so
bravely
held
her
own
against
you
and
strive
no
longer
against
love
which
is
the
very
crown
of
knighthood
and
you
fair
lady
turn
away
your
wrath
if
there
is
fire
in
your
heart
let
it
be
the
fire
of
britomart
blushed
deep
to
hear
these
words
and
sir
artegall
was
glad
at
heart
and
now
sir
scudamore
who
was
divided
between
hope
and
fear
concerning
his
amoret
spoke
saying
pardon
me
if
i
ask
you
for
tidings
of
my
amoret
i
know
that
you
delivered
her
at
no
small
peril
from
the
enchanter
s
prison
where
is
she
for
i
would
seek
her
as
is
indeed
my
bounden
britomart
answered
sir
knight
it
grieves
me
much
that
i
can
not
tell
you
what
you
seek
to
know
after
i
had
delivered
her
from
the
enchanter
as
you
know
i
kept
her
safe
and
truly
there
never
was
companion
more
dear
to
me
than
she
but
one
day
as
we
travelled
we
lighted
from
our
steeds
by
the
wayside
to
rest
awhile
then
i
laid
myself
down
to
sleep
but
when
i
woke
from
my
sleep
she
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
i
called
her
i
sought
her
far
and
near
but
nowhere
could
i
find
her
or
hear
tidings
of
when
sir
scudamore
heard
these
words
he
was
greatly
troubled
and
stood
like
to
a
man
who
has
received
a
mortal
blow
but
glaucé
said
be
not
discouraged
fair
sir
hope
still
for
the
best
why
should
you
trouble
yourself
in
vain
little
comfort
did
he
take
of
these
words
but
when
britomart
said
truly
you
have
great
cause
for
trouble
yet
take
comfort
by
the
light
of
day
i
swear
that
i
will
never
leave
you
till
i
find
and
give
her
back
to
you
then
was
he
not
a
little
comforted
for
he
had
a
great
trust
that
what
britomart
promised
she
would
surely
perform
then
they
all
journeyed
together
to
a
castle
that
was
near
sir
artegall
being
their
guide
there
they
rested
till
their
wounds
were
healed
and
their
strength
repaired
meanwhile
sir
artegall
paid
court
to
britomart
who
after
much
persuasion
though
indeed
she
was
not
unwilling
in
her
heart
consented
to
take
him
for
her
husband
nevertheless
their
marriage
could
not
be
yet
because
sir
artegall
was
bound
on
a
great
adventure
which
he
must
needs
carry
through
nor
could
she
refuse
to
allow
him
to
depart
seeing
that
his
honour
was
bound
in
the
matter
only
it
was
agreed
that
when
three
months
had
waxed
and
waned
then
he
should
return
so
the
knight
departed
britomart
going
with
him
for
a
part
of
his
journey
full
loath
was
she
to
leave
him
finding
ever
new
occasions
for
delay
and
when
these
were
all
spent
then
with
a
heavy
heart
did
she
return
to
the
castle
for
she
also
had
business
in
hand
even
to
seek
together
with
sir
scudamore
for
the
lost
amoret
chapter
xxvi
of
the
fortunes
of
amoret
it
shall
now
be
told
how
the
fair
amoret
was
lost
she
and
britomart
riding
away
from
the
place
where
sir
satyrane
had
held
his
tournament
chanced
in
their
journey
upon
a
wood
there
it
seemed
good
to
them
to
rest
awhile
britomart
being
not
a
little
wearied
with
fighting
in
the
lists
fell
fast
asleep
but
amoret
walked
in
the
wood
as
she
walked
a
giant
rushed
out
of
a
thicket
hard
by
and
seized
her
she
cried
aloud
but
britomart
heard
her
not
so
deep
was
she
in
slumber
a
horrible
monster
to
behold
he
was
feeding
on
the
raw
flesh
of
men
and
beasts
with
a
face
red
as
blood
and
two
great
ears
like
to
the
ears
of
an
elephant
he
was
covered
with
shaggy
hair
and
in
his
hand
a
young
oak
with
sharp
snags
that
had
been
hardened
in
the
fire
till
they
were
as
steel
he
carried
her
through
the
wood
to
his
cave
and
threw
her
in
for
a
while
she
lay
without
sense
then
being
somewhat
recovered
she
heard
someone
sighing
and
sobbing
and
inquired
who
it
was
that
spoke
then
that
other
said
listen
unhappy
one
and
i
will
tell
you
my
story
from
which
you
may
learn
in
what
plight
you
yourself
are
twenty
days
have
i
dwelt
in
this
dreadful
place
and
in
these
twenty
days
have
i
seen
seven
women
slain
and
devoured
and
now
he
has
for
store
three
only
yourself
and
me
and
an
old
woman
yonder
and
of
these
three
he
will
surely
devour
one
and
if
you
ask
my
history
it
is
this
i
am
daughter
to
a
lord
of
high
degree
and
it
happened
to
me
to
love
a
squire
of
low
degree
of
low
degree
he
was
but
so
comely
as
to
be
a
fit
mate
for
the
proudest
lady
in
the
land
nevertheless
my
father
loving
me
well
after
his
fashion
and
seeking
my
advancement
would
have
none
of
him
but
i
being
steadfast
in
my
mind
made
a
resolve
to
flee
far
from
my
home
and
take
with
my
lover
such
a
lot
as
fortune
might
bring
on
a
certain
day
therefore
it
was
appointed
that
i
should
meet
him
at
a
certain
place
to
which
place
i
came
but
he
alas
was
not
there
then
this
monster
found
me
and
carried
me
away
as
an
eagle
carries
off
a
after
they
had
talked
awhile
lo
the
monster
himself
came
back
to
his
cave
and
amoret
as
soon
as
she
saw
him
leapt
from
her
place
which
chanced
to
be
near
to
the
mouth
of
the
cave
and
fled
away
on
her
feet
as
fast
as
she
could
and
the
monster
perceiving
her
flight
pursued
her
fleet
of
foot
was
she
but
it
had
fared
ill
with
her
but
for
a
happy
chance
which
brought
her
help
beyond
all
hope
as
shall
now
be
told
there
dwelt
in
those
parts
a
famous
huntress
belphœbe
by
name
this
belphœbe
was
own
sister
to
amoret
that
day
she
was
following
the
chase
pursuing
leopards
and
bears
of
which
beasts
there
was
a
great
multitude
in
those
woods
with
her
were
her
companions
the
forest
nymphs
and
also
a
gentle
squire
who
was
her
lover
now
the
squire
chanced
to
be
separated
from
the
rest
of
his
company
and
so
came
to
the
very
place
where
the
monster
was
in
chase
of
amoret
by
this
time
he
had
overtaken
her
and
caught
her
up
in
his
arms
and
when
the
squire
perceived
it
and
set
upon
him
seeking
to
deliver
her
out
of
his
hands
the
villain
used
this
crafty
device
when
the
squire
would
have
thrust
at
him
with
the
which
he
carried
then
the
monster
would
shield
himself
with
the
body
of
amoret
and
when
the
squire
held
back
his
blow
or
when
the
blow
chanced
to
fall
ever
so
lightly
on
the
dame
then
the
monster
laughed
aloud
so
they
two
contended
awhile
but
at
the
last
the
squire
dealt
his
adversary
a
shrewd
blow
and
wounded
him
sorely
but
this
did
not
abate
his
rage
for
throwing
amoret
on
the
ground
he
set
upon
the
squire
so
fiercely
with
his
club
that
the
man
had
much
ado
to
save
himself
from
being
beaten
down
nor
can
it
be
known
what
had
been
the
issue
for
now
belphœbe
hearing
the
sound
of
the
strokes
through
the
wood
and
guided
by
her
ear
drew
near
holding
her
bow
in
her
hand
with
an
arrow
upon
the
string
ready
to
be
despatched
when
the
monster
saw
her
he
knowing
how
deadly
was
her
aim
turned
and
fled
nor
did
she
fail
to
pursue
swift
of
foot
was
she
and
ere
he
could
reach
his
cave
she
smote
him
on
the
back
of
the
neck
with
an
arrow
he
fell
to
the
ground
with
a
great
crash
and
when
she
came
up
thinking
to
put
an
end
to
him
lo
he
was
already
dead
thereupon
she
went
into
the
cave
and
while
she
wondered
that
a
place
could
be
so
foul
she
heard
a
whispering
and
a
low
sort
of
groaning
then
she
said
to
herself
are
these
spirits
that
suffer
in
this
place
of
dread
and
darkness
and
afterwards
aloud
if
there
be
any
here
let
them
come
forth
if
only
they
be
free
to
thereupon
æmilia
stood
up
from
the
place
where
she
had
been
lying
and
told
her
story
come
forth
said
belphœbe
when
she
heard
the
tale
haply
i
may
give
you
so
she
led
her
to
the
place
where
she
had
left
the
squire
and
the
fair
amoret
and
now
there
befell
an
evil
chance
which
brought
about
no
small
trouble
amoret
was
in
a
piteous
plight
as
may
easily
be
believed
for
first
she
had
been
affrighted
almost
to
death
by
the
monster
and
then
she
had
been
sorely
bruised
when
he
cast
her
so
roughly
to
the
ground
so
she
lay
as
one
without
life
and
the
gentle
squire
was
full
of
compassion
when
he
saw
her
hurts
especially
the
wound
which
he
himself
had
made
with
his
when
the
monster
held
her
before
him
as
a
shield
and
now
belphœbe
coming
back
from
the
cave
saw
him
looking
at
her
as
it
might
be
in
lover
s
fashion
and
a
great
pang
of
jealousy
and
anger
moved
in
her
heart
at
first
she
thought
to
slay
them
both
with
the
arrow
which
she
held
in
her
hand
but
keeping
herself
back
from
this
she
cried
is
this
then
the
faith
you
keep
and
with
the
word
she
turned
her
face
and
fled
into
the
wood
the
squire
knowing
that
he
was
wrongly
blamed
made
haste
to
follow
her
yet
overtaking
her
he
did
not
dare
to
come
near
and
when
he
would
have
told
her
the
truth
she
would
not
listen
but
made
as
if
she
would
slay
him
with
an
arrow
so
after
having
long
followed
her
in
vain
he
turned
back
and
finding
a
solitary
place
in
the
depth
of
a
forest
made
there
a
cabin
for
himself
where
he
dwelt
in
most
unhappy
sort
his
weapons
of
war
he
broke
and
vowed
never
to
use
them
again
also
he
swore
a
great
oath
that
he
would
never
more
speak
to
woman
his
garments
which
were
of
the
seemliest
fashion
he
cut
into
the
strangest
shape
and
his
hair
he
suffered
to
grow
as
it
would
and
fall
untrimmed
about
his
shoulders
so
he
lived
for
many
days
it
chanced
one
day
that
a
turtle
dove
which
also
had
lost
its
mate
came
near
and
as
if
it
could
understand
what
was
in
his
heart
behaved
in
a
most
friendly
and
familiar
fashion
and
this
it
did
again
and
again
the
bird
would
sit
upon
the
branch
of
a
tree
hard
by
and
sing
to
him
and
he
by
way
of
guerdon
for
its
song
would
share
with
him
such
slender
meals
as
he
had
on
a
certain
day
he
brought
out
from
a
certain
place
certain
gifts
which
belphœbe
had
bestowed
upon
him
in
the
days
when
the
affection
between
them
was
yet
unbroken
among
these
was
a
ruby
of
the
finest
water
with
a
gold
setting
in
the
shape
of
a
heart
and
a
chain
of
gold
fastened
to
the
setting
this
jewel
he
took
and
binding
it
with
a
riband
of
his
lady
s
colour
tied
it
round
the
neck
of
the
dove
and
solaced
his
mind
by
gazing
on
it
but
no
sooner
had
the
bird
felt
the
jewel
tied
about
his
neck
than
he
spread
out
his
wings
and
flew
away
not
a
little
troubled
was
he
at
this
matter
for
he
had
lost
not
the
companionship
of
the
bird
only
but
the
jewel
also
so
was
his
trouble
not
a
little
increased
but
the
bird
flew
in
a
straight
line
to
the
abode
of
belphœbe
and
found
her
sitting
in
an
arbour
taking
rest
from
the
toils
of
the
chase
for
she
still
followed
in
the
ways
of
a
huntress
though
in
truth
she
was
not
a
little
troubled
that
she
had
lost
her
lover
so
soon
as
she
saw
the
bird
she
spied
the
jewel
about
his
neck
and
knew
it
for
her
own
gift
and
the
riband
also
wherewith
it
was
bound
thereupon
she
rose
from
her
place
and
would
have
caught
it
in
her
hand
but
the
bird
flew
away
for
a
short
space
it
flew
and
then
tarried
for
a
space
and
then
when
belphœbe
came
near
flew
away
once
more
so
it
drew
the
lady
on
from
place
to
place
ever
seeming
ready
to
be
caught
yet
ever
again
escaping
till
it
brought
her
to
the
place
where
the
squire
dwelt
in
his
unhappiness
there
it
perched
on
his
hand
and
sang
a
song
sweet
and
sad
as
if
to
suit
his
sorrowful
estate
so
spent
was
he
with
grief
and
trouble
that
the
lady
knew
him
not
but
only
saw
that
he
was
in
great
misery
yet
judged
that
he
had
fallen
into
it
from
better
things
thereupon
she
said
unhappy
man
what
has
brought
you
into
this
evil
plight
if
it
is
heaven
s
will
then
we
must
submit
but
if
it
is
of
man
s
wrongdoing
then
may
the
wrong
be
set
right
but
if
it
is
of
your
own
will
know
that
no
man
should
so
neglect
the
gifts
of
god
who
wills
that
all
should
be
o
lady
answered
the
squire
surely
it
is
no
one
but
yourself
that
has
brought
me
into
this
and
he
showed
her
the
whole
truth
so
peace
was
made
again
between
the
two
chapter
xxvii
of
sir
artegall
and
the
knight
sanglier
it
is
now
time
that
the
story
of
sir
artegall
should
be
told
how
he
was
bred
up
in
the
ways
of
justice
now
this
story
as
it
was
commonly
reported
was
this
astræa
who
was
the
goddess
of
justice
found
him
when
he
was
a
child
playing
with
other
children
of
a
like
age
she
liking
him
well
and
finding
him
innocent
and
without
guile
took
him
away
with
her
to
a
solitary
place
where
she
as
yet
she
lived
upon
the
there
instructed
and
trained
him
to
be
such
an
one
as
she
desired
she
taught
him
to
weigh
right
and
wrong
in
equal
scales
and
to
measure
out
equity
according
to
the
rule
of
conscience
and
because
there
were
no
men
in
the
place
she
taught
him
to
seek
experience
of
the
right
way
among
the
beasts
of
the
forest
for
these
also
oppress
their
own
kind
also
she
caused
him
to
be
instructed
in
the
use
of
arms
in
which
use
he
became
in
due
time
most
expert
so
that
he
came
to
be
held
in
high
repute
as
being
one
who
could
not
only
distinguish
most
truly
between
right
and
wrong
but
could
also
maintain
the
same
by
force
of
arms
also
she
gave
him
a
sword
of
great
repute
which
jupiter
himself
had
used
in
his
war
against
the
titans
chrysaor
was
its
name
which
being
interpreted
is
sword
of
of
finest
temper
was
it
and
beautiful
to
behold
also
she
gave
her
servant
to
attend
upon
was
his
name
this
same
talus
wielded
an
iron
flail
with
which
to
thresh
out
falsehood
and
separate
the
truth
this
artegall
being
now
come
to
years
of
manhood
betook
himself
as
was
the
wont
of
all
worthy
knights
in
those
days
to
the
court
of
queen
gloriana
and
she
gave
him
as
the
task
which
he
should
accomplish
the
succouring
of
a
distressed
lady
irene
by
name
from
whom
a
tyrant
whom
men
called
grantorto
withheld
the
heritage
which
was
rightly
hers
for
she
judged
that
there
was
no
man
who
could
better
discern
the
right
and
having
discerned
it
could
more
effectually
cause
it
to
prevail
so
it
came
to
pass
that
he
and
talus
who
was
his
squire
rode
off
on
their
errand
on
their
way
they
saw
as
sorry
a
sight
as
ever
was
seen
by
mortal
eyes
a
squire
sitting
upon
the
ground
in
most
doleful
fashion
and
hard
by
him
lying
on
the
ground
the
headless
corpse
of
a
lady
it
was
indeed
a
piteous
thing
to
see
the
gay
apparel
of
the
dead
most
cruelly
drenched
in
blood
now
tell
me
cried
sir
artegall
by
what
foul
mischance
this
dreadful
thing
has
oh
sir
answered
the
squire
as
i
sat
here
with
the
lady
whom
i
love
there
came
riding
by
a
knight
who
had
in
his
company
this
fair
dame
whom
you
see
lying
here
and
whether
he
was
taken
with
the
sight
of
my
love
or
was
weary
of
his
own
i
know
not
but
this
he
said
ho
fellow
let
us
make
and
when
i
denied
his
request
and
the
two
ladies
also
cried
out
upon
him
then
he
threw
down
the
dame
his
companion
on
the
ground
and
lawlessly
taking
away
from
me
my
own
set
her
upon
his
horse
and
when
his
lady
saw
what
he
had
done
and
how
he
was
riding
away
she
followed
him
as
fast
as
she
could
and
laying
hold
of
his
arm
cried
out
leave
me
not
in
this
fashion
slay
me
rather
and
he
in
a
fury
drew
his
sword
and
with
a
single
stroke
shore
off
her
head
even
in
the
place
where
now
she
lies
and
now
he
has
gone
taking
my
love
with
tell
me
said
sir
artegall
by
which
way
he
went
tell
me
also
by
what
signs
i
may
know
but
fair
sir
the
squire
made
answer
he
has
gone
so
long
that
you
can
scarce
hope
to
overtake
him
yet
if
you
would
know
the
way
he
rode
across
the
and
he
pointed
with
his
hand
to
the
course
which
the
knight
had
followed
as
for
the
marks
know
that
he
carried
on
his
shield
a
broken
sword
on
a
field
of
blood
and
indeed
it
seemed
to
be
a
fitting
follow
him
said
sir
artegall
to
his
page
talus
and
the
page
followed
him
swift
as
a
swallow
flies
over
a
field
nor
was
it
long
before
he
overtook
the
sanglier
he
was
bade
him
come
back
with
him
and
answer
for
his
deed
no
little
scorn
did
the
knight
feel
to
be
so
commanded
and
setting
down
the
lady
whom
he
carried
on
his
steed
rode
at
the
page
talus
with
all
his
force
full
on
the
body
he
struck
him
but
moved
him
no
more
than
a
rock
is
moved
by
some
stone
that
is
thrown
at
it
on
the
other
hand
talus
dealt
him
such
a
blow
that
he
laid
him
prostrate
on
the
ground
ere
he
could
recover
himself
talus
had
seized
him
in
an
iron
grip
and
forced
him
to
follow
him
the
lady
also
though
she
would
have
fled
in
her
fear
following
so
they
came
to
sir
artegall
what
is
this
that
you
have
done
said
sir
artegall
nay
said
the
knight
i
did
it
not
i
am
guiltless
of
the
blood
of
this
dame
and
this
i
will
prove
on
the
body
of
this
false
squire
if
he
will
meet
me
hand
to
now
the
squire
was
not
of
such
prowess
as
to
meet
so
doughty
a
knight
then
said
sir
artegall
this
is
a
doubtful
cause
which
it
were
not
well
to
try
by
arbitrament
of
battle
will
you
therefore
commit
the
matter
to
me
and
abide
by
my
judgment
and
sentence
to
this
they
both
consented
then
said
sir
artegall
since
each
of
you
denies
that
this
lady
came
by
her
death
through
his
deed
and
each
claims
the
living
lady
as
his
own
my
judgment
is
that
both
the
living
and
the
dead
shall
be
equally
divided
and
each
shall
have
his
part
both
of
one
and
of
the
other
also
i
decree
that
if
either
of
you
two
shall
reject
this
my
sentence
he
shall
carry
this
head
as
a
penance
for
twelve
months
by
way
of
witness
that
he
brought
about
her
sir
sanglier
gladly
accepted
the
doom
but
the
squire
was
for
he
really
loved
the
dame
who
had
been
reft
from
him
nay
said
he
i
would
rather
by
far
that
she
should
live
though
i
lose
tis
well
said
squire
cried
sir
artegall
and
now
i
perceive
that
you
are
indeed
guiltless
in
this
matter
as
for
you
sir
knight
who
care
so
little
for
the
living
or
the
dead
take
this
head
and
carry
it
for
a
twelve
months
space
to
be
a
witness
of
your
shame
and
sir
sanglier
was
ill
content
with
this
sentence
and
would
have
refused
to
abide
by
it
only
when
he
saw
talus
approaching
with
intent
to
compel
him
he
made
his
submission
for
he
knew
by
experience
how
great
was
his
strength
then
said
the
squire
oh
sir
you
have
done
me
such
service
as
i
can
never
repay
let
me
therefore
attend
you
as
your
squire
and
that
without
fee
or
not
so
sir
artegall
made
answer
i
am
well
content
to
be
as
i
am
do
you
follow
your
own
affairs
as
for
me
talus
here
will
be
sufficient
for
my
chapter
xxviii
of
other
adventures
of
sir
artegall
as
sir
artegall
with
talus
following
rode
on
he
met
a
dwarf
who
was
travelling
with
all
the
speed
that
he
could
use
stay
awhile
he
said
for
i
have
somewhat
to
ask
of
and
the
dwarf
though
somewhat
loath
could
not
but
yield
now
the
dwarf
s
name
was
dony
and
he
served
the
fair
florimell
not
a
little
of
his
discourse
therefore
concerned
the
said
florimell
he
told
how
marinell
was
recovered
of
the
grievous
wound
which
britomart
had
given
him
and
how
he
was
to
wed
the
fair
florimell
say
you
so
cried
artegall
tell
me
therefore
when
the
marriage
shall
be
for
i
would
fain
be
present
at
the
in
three
days
time
as
i
am
informed
answered
the
dwarf
and
i
too
should
be
there
and
the
place
is
the
castle
by
the
seashore
only
there
is
a
hindrance
in
the
way
for
a
little
farther
on
from
this
place
a
cruel
saracen
keeps
the
bridge
by
which
one
must
needs
pass
much
harm
has
he
done
already
to
travellers
and
men
are
fain
to
shun
the
way
that
lies
tell
me
more
about
the
villain
said
sir
artegall
then
dony
set
forth
the
whole
matter
he
is
a
man
of
great
strength
and
expert
in
battle
moreover
he
is
not
a
little
helped
by
the
charms
with
which
the
wicked
witch
his
daughter
supports
him
thus
he
has
gathered
together
much
wealth
store
of
gold
and
lordships
and
farms
this
wealth
he
daily
increases
greatly
by
means
of
this
same
bridge
which
he
holds
by
force
of
arms
no
one
will
he
suffer
to
go
over
unless
he
first
pays
a
toll
be
he
rich
or
poor
if
the
traveller
be
poor
then
a
squire
whom
he
sets
over
this
business
extorts
from
him
this
tribute
as
for
the
richer
sort
these
he
deals
with
himself
men
call
him
pollenté
which
being
interpreted
is
powerful
and
the
name
is
fitting
for
much
power
he
has
and
besides
the
power
he
has
not
a
little
cunning
for
he
is
wont
to
fight
on
this
same
bridge
exceeding
long
is
it
and
narrow
and
full
of
pitfalls
which
he
knows
but
a
stranger
knows
not
and
often
it
happens
that
the
stranger
falls
through
one
of
these
said
pitfalls
into
the
river
beneath
and
while
he
is
confused
with
his
fall
pollenté
leaps
into
the
river
and
takes
him
at
a
disadvantage
and
either
slays
him
outright
or
causes
him
to
drown
then
he
takes
the
spoils
of
them
who
perish
in
this
fashion
and
brings
them
to
his
daughter
who
dwells
hard
by
thus
she
has
gathered
together
great
store
of
wealth
so
that
she
exceeds
even
kings
her
they
call
munera
very
fair
is
she
and
gorgeously
attired
many
lords
have
sought
to
have
her
for
a
wife
but
in
her
pride
she
thinks
scorn
of
them
this
is
the
story
which
dony
the
dwarf
told
to
sir
artegall
when
the
knight
heard
it
he
cried
now
by
my
life
i
will
go
none
other
way
but
this
god
helping
so
he
went
on
with
talus
and
the
dwarf
followed
when
they
came
to
the
bridge
there
came
to
them
an
villain
who
said
give
me
the
according
to
the
custom
of
the
place
here
answered
sir
artegall
is
my
and
therewith
dealt
him
such
a
blow
that
he
fell
dead
upon
the
ground
when
the
saracen
knight
saw
this
he
was
very
wrath
and
charged
at
sir
artegall
full
tilt
nor
did
sir
artegall
lag
behind
they
met
in
the
middle
of
the
bridge
where
there
was
a
trap
cunningly
devised
the
saracen
looked
that
his
adversary
should
fall
into
it
unawares
and
be
sorely
bruised
and
wounded
but
sir
artegall
having
been
forewarned
by
the
dwarf
leapt
into
the
river
clear
of
all
that
might
do
damage
to
horse
or
man
the
saracen
leapt
in
like
fashion
and
the
two
met
in
the
water
not
one
whit
less
hotly
than
had
they
been
on
the
dry
land
and
here
the
pagan
had
no
small
advantage
for
he
was
accustomed
to
fight
in
this
fashion
and
his
horse
also
could
swim
like
a
fish
sir
artegall
perceiving
that
the
odds
were
against
him
saw
that
he
must
close
with
his
adversary
without
delay
long
they
wrestled
together
and
sir
artegall
never
loosened
his
grip
one
whit
and
at
last
forced
him
from
his
saddle
so
that
he
no
longer
had
the
advantage
of
the
swimming
of
his
horse
and
yet
the
issue
of
the
fight
was
doubtful
awhile
for
the
saracen
was
both
brave
and
expert
in
arms
nevertheless
sir
artegall
had
the
better
breath
as
one
that
followed
temperance
in
all
things
and
so
prevailed
until
the
saracen
was
compelled
to
turn
from
the
river
to
the
land
hoping
so
to
escape
yet
even
as
he
lifted
his
head
from
the
stream
to
the
brink
the
knight
dealt
him
so
heavy
a
blow
that
it
clean
shore
the
head
from
the
neck
and
this
being
done
then
he
went
his
way
to
the
castle
where
the
pagan
s
daughter
dwelt
illustration
sir
artegall
and
the
saracen
here
he
was
denied
entrance
being
received
with
so
great
a
shower
of
stones
that
he
was
forced
to
retreat
then
he
sent
talus
bidding
him
compel
an
entrance
and
this
he
did
without
damage
to
himself
and
with
his
iron
flail
he
battered
the
door
so
fiercely
that
the
whole
place
shook
from
the
foundation
to
the
roof
all
who
were
within
were
greatly
dismayed
and
the
lady
munera
herself
came
out
and
stood
upon
the
castle
wall
when
she
saw
in
what
peril
she
was
she
used
all
the
devices
which
she
could
imagine
to
deliver
herself
first
she
besought
the
adversary
with
many
prayers
to
cease
from
his
indeed
she
was
not
wont
to
beseech
in
vain
then
she
tried
what
enchantments
could
do
and
of
these
she
had
a
great
store
at
her
command
and
when
she
found
that
prayers
and
enchantments
availed
nothing
she
thought
to
corrupt
the
man
with
great
gifts
she
caused
sacks
of
gold
and
precious
things
to
be
brought
and
poured
from
the
castle
wall
thinking
to
herself
that
he
would
surely
cease
from
his
battering
and
give
her
at
the
least
some
respite
and
delay
but
the
riches
moved
him
no
more
than
the
entreaties
and
enchantments
still
he
battered
with
his
iron
flail
till
he
broke
down
the
door
and
made
a
way
for
his
master
to
enter
no
one
dared
to
lift
a
hand
against
them
all
through
the
castle
they
moved
at
their
will
the
lady
munera
for
a
while
they
could
not
find
at
the
last
talus
than
whom
a
bloodhound
was
not
more
keen
to
scent
a
runaway
found
her
hidden
under
a
heap
of
gold
thence
he
drew
her
from
her
lair
pitying
her
not
at
all
for
now
even
sir
artegall
seeing
how
fair
she
was
had
some
compassion
in
his
heart
and
when
she
knelt
before
him
would
have
given
her
some
remission
of
the
penalty
but
there
was
no
such
thought
in
the
heart
of
talus
he
cared
for
naught
but
to
do
justice
to
the
full
so
he
took
her
by
the
waist
she
crying
loudly
the
while
and
cast
her
into
the
river
and
when
he
had
wrought
this
justice
upon
her
he
took
all
the
pelf
that
he
found
in
the
castle
and
ground
it
small
to
powder
and
threw
it
into
the
water
this
done
he
razed
the
castle
to
the
ground
destroying
it
utterly
so
that
no
one
in
days
to
come
should
think
to
set
it
up
again
after
this
sir
artegall
reformed
the
evil
customs
of
the
bridge
ordering
that
in
time
to
come
it
should
be
free
for
all
to
pass
over
this
good
deed
accomplished
they
journeyed
on
to
the
castle
by
the
sea
where
the
nuptials
of
sir
marinell
and
the
fair
florimell
were
to
be
celebrated
with
great
honour
there
were
great
feastings
and
rejoicings
to
which
an
infinite
concourse
of
lords
and
ladies
resorted
from
all
quarters
no
knight
that
was
held
in
repute
for
valour
and
deeds
of
arms
was
absent
when
the
banquet
which
was
furnished
with
all
rare
meats
and
drinks
that
the
heart
of
man
could
desire
was
finished
then
the
company
addressed
themselves
to
feats
of
arms
first
came
forth
sir
marinell
and
six
knights
with
him
declaring
to
hold
the
field
against
all
comers
in
right
of
florimell
and
to
affirm
that
she
was
the
fairest
of
all
the
ladies
upon
earth
against
these
there
came
from
all
parts
such
as
desired
to
try
their
fortune
in
the
were
debarred
many
feats
of
arms
were
wrought
that
day
many
knights
were
unhorsed
and
some
were
wounded
but
none
so
it
was
judged
by
common
consent
bore
themselves
more
bravely
than
did
sir
marinell
his
name
therefore
did
the
heralds
proclaim
as
the
champion
of
the
day
and
on
the
second
day
the
event
was
the
same
there
was
much
fighting
many
suffered
loss
and
overthrow
and
in
the
end
the
heralds
proclaimed
as
they
had
done
before
the
victory
of
sir
marinell
but
on
the
third
day
things
fell
out
otherwise
for
the
knight
pursuing
his
adversaries
when
he
had
put
them
to
flight
somewhat
rashly
was
surrounded
by
them
and
taken
prisoner
while
they
were
leading
him
away
it
so
chanced
that
sir
artegall
came
into
the
and
close
behind
him
followed
bragadocchio
who
had
in
his
company
the
false
florimell
when
sir
artegall
understood
what
mishap
had
befallen
sir
marinell
he
said
to
bragadocchio
i
would
fain
help
this
brave
knight
but
i
would
not
have
anyone
know
who
i
am
therefore
i
pray
thee
change
shields
with
and
bragadocchio
full
willingly
did
so
thinking
that
he
might
thus
win
to
himself
renown
without
cost
or
danger
sir
artegall
therefore
taking
bragadocchio
s
shield
set
upon
the
knights
who
were
leading
away
sir
marinell
there
were
a
hundred
in
all
of
these
fifty
assailed
him
and
the
other
fifty
stayed
behind
to
guard
the
prisoner
but
for
all
that
there
were
so
many
they
could
not
stand
against
him
the
fifty
who
assailed
him
he
speedily
put
to
flight
and
the
fifty
who
would
have
kept
the
prisoner
did
not
hinder
sir
artegall
from
setting
him
free
then
sir
marinell
being
delivered
and
armed
anew
for
they
had
taken
his
arms
from
him
the
two
joined
their
forces
and
drove
their
adversaries
out
of
the
field
there
was
not
one
among
them
who
could
hold
up
his
head
or
make
a
stand
against
them
when
sir
artegall
had
accomplished
this
then
he
gave
back
the
shield
to
bragadocchio
who
had
stayed
to
see
the
issue
of
the
day
keeping
with
him
the
false
florimell
after
this
the
trumpets
sounded
and
the
judges
rose
up
in
their
place
and
summoned
the
company
saying
hear
all
ye
knights
who
have
borne
arms
and
know
to
whom
the
prize
of
valour
is
then
came
forth
the
fair
florimell
from
the
place
where
she
sat
as
queen
of
the
tourney
that
she
might
give
to
each
knight
his
proper
guerdon
and
to
him
who
should
be
held
to
have
best
acquitted
himself
the
first
prize
of
all
loudly
did
they
call
for
the
stranger
knight
who
had
wrought
such
prodigies
of
valour
and
strength
in
delivering
sir
marinell
he
did
not
come
forward
but
in
his
stead
bragadocchio
presented
himself
with
the
shield
bearing
the
device
which
all
men
a
sun
shining
in
a
field
of
gold
when
the
company
saw
this
they
thinking
that
this
was
indeed
the
champion
set
up
a
great
shout
and
the
trumpets
sounded
and
florimell
rose
up
and
greeted
him
most
graciously
thanking
him
for
his
championship
but
all
this
praise
turned
the
vain
fellow
s
mind
not
for
your
sake
madam
said
he
but
for
my
own
dear
lady
s
sake
did
i
this
adding
other
words
such
as
could
not
pass
the
lips
of
a
true
knight
then
he
called
to
trompart
his
squire
saying
bring
forth
the
fairest
of
all
dames
thereupon
trompart
led
forth
the
false
florimell
for
he
had
her
in
keeping
hidden
by
a
veil
from
the
common
sight
great
was
the
astonishment
of
the
company
when
they
saw
her
this
surely
is
florimell
they
said
to
themselves
or
if
it
be
not
then
it
is
one
fairer
than
never
were
men
more
perplexed
than
the
guests
that
day
nor
was
sir
marinell
himself
less
amazed
than
the
rest
and
as
he
gazed
the
more
and
more
steadfastly
did
he
believe
that
this
false
florimell
was
indeed
the
true
but
now
sir
artegall
who
stood
in
the
press
of
the
crowd
closely
disguised
heard
the
false
boaster
s
words
and
could
not
contain
himself
any
more
but
came
forth
and
cried
with
a
loud
voice
false
boaster
strutting
thus
in
borrowed
plumes
and
doing
dishonour
to
others
with
your
lies
verily
when
each
shall
have
his
due
great
will
be
your
disgrace
tis
true
that
the
shield
which
you
bear
was
this
day
borne
by
him
who
delivered
sir
marinell
but
yours
was
not
the
arm
which
struck
the
blow
and
now
hold
forth
your
sword
and
let
it
show
what
marks
of
battle
it
bears
and
if
you
bear
in
your
body
the
mark
of
a
wound
let
this
company
behold
it
nay
boaster
this
is
the
sword
which
won
the
victory
and
these
the
wounds
which
were
endured
in
the
winning
and
here
he
showed
his
sword
which
bore
the
dint
of
many
a
blow
and
the
wounds
which
he
carried
on
his
arms
and
his
body
and
he
further
said
as
for
this
florimell
of
yours
i
warrant
she
is
no
true
dame
but
only
a
fit
companion
for
such
as
then
he
took
the
true
florimell
by
the
hand
and
led
her
she
blushing
the
while
for
the
colour
on
her
fair
face
was
of
roses
mixed
with
lilies
and
set
her
by
the
side
of
the
false
and
then
lo
a
great
marvel
the
false
dame
melted
away
as
snow
melts
in
the
sunshine
in
a
moment
naught
remained
of
her
save
only
the
empty
girdle
which
once
had
compassed
her
waist
so
on
a
day
of
storm
we
see
a
rainbow
spanning
the
sky
with
all
its
goodly
colours
and
in
a
moment
it
vanishes
from
our
sight
so
did
this
lovely
creature
the
false
florimell
vanish
from
before
the
eyes
of
that
company
and
now
sir
artegall
took
up
the
golden
girdle
which
alone
remained
of
all
that
fair
show
for
this
indeed
was
true
while
all
else
was
false
this
he
presented
to
the
true
florimell
and
she
forthwith
fastened
it
about
her
waist
many
a
fair
dame
before
had
essayed
to
do
it
but
not
one
had
found
it
truly
and
rightly
fit
but
the
end
of
these
things
was
not
yet
for
now
sir
guyon
came
forth
from
the
crowd
to
claim
his
own
good
steed
which
as
has
been
told
had
been
stolen
from
him
in
time
past
by
this
false
thief
with
one
hand
he
seized
the
golden
bit
and
with
the
other
he
drew
forth
his
sword
from
its
sheath
for
he
would
have
smitten
the
knave
with
a
deadly
blow
but
that
the
press
hindered
him
for
now
there
was
a
great
tumult
in
the
place
thereupon
sir
artegall
came
forth
and
would
fain
know
how
the
knight
had
been
robbed
of
his
horse
then
sir
guyon
told
the
story
how
while
he
was
busy
setting
right
a
grievous
wrong
some
knave
had
stolen
his
horse
and
now
said
he
i
challenge
the
knave
who
robbed
me
of
it
to
deadly
so
he
spoke
but
bragadocchio
held
back
he
had
no
liking
for
such
things
then
said
sir
artegall
this
is
truly
the
law
of
knighthood
that
if
one
man
claim
a
thing
and
offer
to
make
good
his
claim
by
might
of
arms
and
the
other
will
not
the
judgment
goes
against
the
latter
by
default
nevertheless
for
further
and
clearer
discovery
of
the
truth
can
you
who
claim
this
horse
as
your
own
declare
some
tokens
in
proof
to
this
answered
sir
guyon
most
truly
i
can
such
a
token
there
is
a
black
spot
in
the
beast
s
mouth
like
in
shape
to
a
horse
s
but
when
they
thought
to
look
into
his
mouth
so
as
to
discern
the
token
he
wounded
first
one
and
then
another
so
sorely
that
they
were
like
to
die
from
no
one
would
he
suffer
such
a
thing
but
when
sir
guyon
called
him
by
his
hearing
the
voice
stood
still
as
if
he
had
been
bound
and
suffered
them
to
open
his
mouth
so
that
all
could
see
the
mark
as
it
had
been
described
nay
more
he
would
follow
sir
guyon
breaking
the
band
with
which
he
was
tied
and
frisked
right
gaily
ay
and
bent
his
knee
then
said
sir
artegall
now
it
may
be
plainly
discerned
that
the
horse
is
indeed
yours
take
it
therefore
with
its
saddle
of
gold
and
let
this
boaster
go
horseless
till
he
can
win
a
steed
for
much
was
bragadocchio
moved
to
be
so
shamed
in
the
presence
of
all
that
moved
that
for
a
while
he
laid
aside
his
very
cowardice
and
broke
forth
into
angry
words
against
sir
artegall
the
knight
made
as
if
he
would
have
slain
the
knave
with
his
sword
but
sir
guyon
stayed
him
sir
said
he
it
would
ill
suit
your
dignity
to
vent
your
wrath
on
such
a
knave
as
this
the
meetest
punishment
for
him
is
to
be
put
to
open
shame
in
the
sight
of
all
this
but
talus
was
not
minded
to
let
the
knave
escape
so
easily
he
caught
him
by
the
neck
and
led
him
out
of
the
hall
and
shaved
his
beard
and
reft
away
his
shield
and
blotted
out
the
escutcheon
and
defaced
all
his
arms
nor
did
the
false
squire
trompart
fare
better
though
he
cunningly
had
essayed
to
fly
for
talus
overtook
him
and
served
him
in
the
like
way
so
may
all
makers
of
falsehood
fare
chapter
xxix
sir
artegall
does
justice
the
marriage
of
sir
marinell
and
the
fair
florimell
having
been
duly
celebrated
with
much
rejoicing
and
great
festivity
sir
artegall
set
forth
again
upon
his
travels
on
his
way
which
for
a
while
lay
by
the
seashore
he
came
upon
two
men
who
were
wholly
taken
up
with
a
great
quarrel
they
were
brothers
as
might
clearly
be
seen
by
the
likeness
between
them
near
them
stood
two
fair
dames
who
would
fain
have
reconciled
them
but
the
brothers
took
no
heed
of
their
words
whether
they
spoke
gently
or
in
threatening
fashion
between
them
stood
a
strong
chest
bound
about
with
bands
of
iron
it
seemed
to
have
been
much
battered
whether
by
the
violence
of
the
sea
or
by
the
chances
of
long
travel
from
foreign
parts
it
was
indeed
for
this
that
the
two
seemed
to
be
contending
for
now
the
one
and
now
the
other
would
lay
his
hands
upon
it
so
did
they
come
to
blows
but
the
two
damsels
had
so
far
hindered
them
from
coming
to
this
extremity
not
the
less
were
they
bent
on
trying
their
cause
by
the
sword
it
seemed
as
if
it
could
not
be
decided
in
any
other
fashion
but
when
they
were
on
the
point
to
do
so
notwithstanding
all
that
the
damsels
could
say
or
do
then
did
sir
artegall
appear
sirs
said
he
are
you
content
to
tell
me
the
cause
of
your
strife
to
this
the
two
gave
a
common
consent
sir
said
the
was
his
our
father
who
was
a
knight
milesio
by
name
divided
between
us
by
his
testament
his
estate
that
is
to
say
two
islands
which
you
see
yonder
one
is
but
a
little
mount
but
in
years
past
it
was
fully
as
long
and
broad
as
that
which
you
see
on
the
other
side
of
the
bay
to
me
he
bequeathed
that
island
which
you
see
to
be
so
small
for
the
sea
as
years
have
passed
by
has
wasted
it
and
in
so
doing
has
largely
increased
the
other
for
what
the
waves
took
away
from
my
land
they
added
unto
his
there
is
also
this
to
be
told
i
was
betrothed
to
that
fair
lady
who
stands
yonder
philtera
by
name
and
with
her
i
was
to
receive
a
goodly
dowry
so
soon
as
we
should
be
linked
together
in
bonds
of
wedlock
my
younger
brother
whose
name
is
amidas
was
betrothed
to
that
other
dame
whom
you
see
yonder
lucy
by
name
she
had
but
small
dower
but
much
of
that
which
is
far
wit
goodness
now
when
the
lady
philtera
saw
that
my
lands
had
been
greatly
decayed
and
the
lands
of
my
brother
not
less
increased
she
deserted
me
and
betook
herself
to
my
brother
who
that
he
might
receive
her
deserted
his
own
betrothed
to
wit
the
fair
lucy
thereupon
this
damsel
in
her
unhappiness
thinking
it
better
to
die
than
to
suffer
such
a
contumely
and
pain
threw
herself
into
the
sea
but
while
she
floated
among
the
waves
being
i
take
it
buoyed
up
by
her
clothing
she
chanced
upon
this
chest
which
you
see
and
now
there
befell
her
what
has
often
befallen
others
in
like
case
she
who
had
thought
death
to
be
better
than
life
when
she
saw
his
terrors
close
at
hand
changed
her
mind
and
desired
to
live
catching
hold
therefore
of
this
chest
she
clung
to
it
and
after
much
tossing
by
the
sea
was
at
last
thrown
upon
my
island
and
i
chancing
at
that
time
to
be
walking
on
the
shore
espied
her
and
she
being
by
this
time
much
spent
with
hunger
and
cold
and
little
able
to
help
herself
i
did
so
to
speak
save
her
from
death
and
she
being
not
a
little
grateful
for
this
same
help
bestowed
upon
me
the
dowry
which
fortune
had
given
her
to
wit
the
chest
on
which
she
had
chanced
and
what
was
far
more
precious
her
own
self
when
we
had
opened
the
chest
we
found
in
it
a
great
store
of
treasure
and
took
it
for
our
own
use
but
now
this
damsel
philtera
maintains
that
this
chest
is
hers
by
right
that
she
was
bringing
it
from
foreign
lands
that
she
might
deliver
it
to
her
husband
and
that
she
suffered
shipwreck
by
the
way
whether
this
be
so
or
no
i
can
not
say
but
this
i
do
maintain
that
whatever
by
good
fortune
or
by
the
ordering
of
god
has
been
brought
into
my
hands
is
verily
mine
i
not
having
in
any
wise
contrived
the
same
my
land
he
has
and
also
my
betrothed
though
of
that
i
take
no
count
but
my
good
luck
he
shall
not
have
to
this
the
younger
of
the
two
made
this
answer
as
for
the
two
islands
it
is
as
my
brother
has
said
i
do
not
deny
the
truth
but
as
for
this
chest
and
the
treasure
therein
which
has
been
cast
by
the
sea
upon
his
island
that
i
do
affirm
to
belong
to
the
lady
philtera
my
wife
as
she
can
prove
by
most
certain
signs
and
tokens
and
i
do
claim
that
it
be
straightway
rendered
up
to
sir
artegall
said
it
were
no
hard
thing
to
decide
this
matter
if
you
would
refer
it
to
the
judgment
of
some
just
man
are
you
content
so
to
do
yes
said
the
two
with
one
voice
you
shall
be
a
judge
between
us
and
we
will
abide
by
the
judgment
that
you
shall
then
lay
down
your
swords
under
my
feet
said
sir
artegall
and
they
laid
them
down
then
sir
artegall
turning
himself
to
the
younger
of
the
two
brothers
said
to
him
tell
me
now
by
what
right
you
hold
for
yourself
and
withhold
from
your
brother
the
land
which
the
sea
has
taken
from
him
and
added
to
you
i
do
so
the
man
made
answer
because
the
sea
bestowed
it
upon
you
are
in
the
right
said
sir
artegall
it
is
yours
keep
then
turning
himself
to
the
elder
he
said
bracidas
by
what
right
do
you
hold
this
treasure
of
which
your
brother
and
his
wife
affirm
and
not
without
reason
that
it
is
theirs
i
hold
it
said
he
because
the
sea
bestowed
it
upon
you
also
are
in
the
right
said
sir
artegall
it
is
yours
keep
then
speaking
to
both
he
thus
declared
his
sentence
that
which
the
sea
has
taken
is
his
own
none
who
before
possessed
it
has
claim
upon
it
he
may
bestow
it
as
he
will
the
land
which
he
took
from
sir
bracidas
he
gave
to
sir
amidas
let
it
therefore
remain
in
his
hand
the
treasure
which
he
took
from
sir
amidas
or
from
the
lady
philtera
his
wife
he
gave
to
sir
bracidas
let
him
also
keep
the
matter
being
settled
the
knight
went
on
his
way
after
a
while
he
espied
a
great
rout
of
people
and
turned
aside
from
the
road
that
he
might
discover
what
it
might
mean
when
he
came
near
he
saw
a
great
crowd
of
women
in
warlike
array
with
weapons
in
their
hands
and
in
the
midst
of
them
he
saw
a
knight
with
his
hands
tied
tightly
behind
his
back
and
a
halter
about
his
neck
his
face
was
covered
but
his
head
was
bare
it
was
plain
that
the
man
was
about
to
be
hanged
and
as
they
went
the
women
reviled
him
in
bitter
words
when
sir
artegall
came
near
he
said
tell
me
pray
what
this
may
to
this
they
gave
no
answer
but
made
as
if
they
would
assault
him
then
at
the
knight
s
bidding
talus
went
among
them
and
with
a
few
strokes
of
his
iron
flail
sent
them
flying
hither
and
thither
then
he
took
the
knight
who
would
otherwise
have
been
put
to
death
and
brought
him
to
sir
artegall
sir
turpine
unhappy
man
so
chanced
that
he
knew
the
how
came
you
into
this
evil
plight
how
is
it
that
you
suffered
yourself
to
be
thus
enslaved
by
women
who
should
rather
be
subject
to
men
sir
turpine
was
sore
ashamed
and
confounded
and
could
say
but
little
in
his
excuse
for
himself
but
this
was
the
story
which
he
told
i
was
desirous
as
was
indeed
my
knightly
duty
to
find
some
adventure
which
would
be
praiseworthy
in
itself
and
also
bring
me
to
honour
and
i
heard
a
report
that
there
was
a
proud
amazon
who
was
accustomed
to
defy
all
the
knights
of
queen
gloriana
some
she
had
put
to
shame
and
some
she
had
slain
and
the
cause
of
her
rage
was
this
she
had
loved
the
bold
bellodant
and
when
he
disdained
her
then
her
love
was
turned
to
hatred
not
towards
him
only
but
towards
all
knights
to
whom
she
worked
as
indeed
she
still
works
all
the
mischief
that
she
can
devise
any
whom
she
can
subdue
either
by
force
or
fraud
she
treats
in
the
most
evil
fashion
first
she
takes
from
them
their
arms
and
armour
and
then
she
clothes
them
in
women
s
garments
and
compels
them
to
earn
their
bread
by
women
s
work
spinning
and
sewing
and
washing
and
the
like
and
all
the
food
that
she
gives
them
in
recompense
is
but
bread
and
water
so
as
to
disable
them
from
taking
their
revenge
and
if
anyone
is
of
so
manly
a
mind
that
he
sets
himself
against
her
pleasure
him
she
causes
to
be
hanged
out
of
hand
on
that
gibbet
which
you
see
yonder
and
in
this
case
i
stood
for
when
she
overcame
me
in
fight
then
she
put
me
into
that
base
service
of
which
i
have
spoken
and
when
i
refused
then
she
sent
me
with
that
rabble
of
women
whom
you
dispersed
that
i
might
be
done
to
by
what
name
do
they
call
this
amazon
said
sir
artegall
and
where
does
she
dwell
her
name
answered
sir
turpine
is
radigund
a
princess
is
she
of
great
power
and
pride
well
tried
in
arms
and
skilled
in
battle
more
than
i
could
have
believed
had
i
not
known
it
by
my
own
then
said
sir
artegall
by
the
faith
which
i
owe
to
my
queen
and
the
knighthood
which
i
bear
i
will
not
rest
till
i
have
made
trial
of
this
same
amazon
and
have
found
out
for
myself
what
she
has
of
strength
and
skill
and
now
sir
turpine
put
off
these
unseemly
clothes
which
you
wear
and
come
with
me
that
you
may
see
how
my
enterprise
shall
prosper
and
whether
i
shall
avenge
the
cause
of
knighthood
upon
this
to
which
request
sir
turpine
consented
with
all
his
heart
chapter
xxx
radigund
radigund
the
amazon
dwelt
a
mile
or
so
from
the
place
where
the
gallows
had
been
set
up
in
a
city
which
she
had
called
radigone
after
her
own
name
on
the
walls
of
the
city
were
set
watchmen
to
warn
the
queen
of
the
coming
of
strangers
one
of
these
espied
sir
artegall
and
his
company
and
gave
warning
accordingly
saying
i
see
three
strangers
one
of
them
is
a
knight
fully
armed
and
the
others
have
a
warlike
look
thereupon
all
the
people
ran
in
haste
to
arm
themselves
like
to
bees
when
they
come
forth
in
a
swarm
from
their
hive
and
radigund
herself
as
a
man
came
forth
from
her
palace
meanwhile
the
three
drew
near
to
the
city
gate
and
when
the
porter
thinking
scorn
of
them
because
they
were
so
few
did
not
trouble
to
open
to
them
the
gate
they
beat
upon
it
with
many
blows
threatening
the
man
also
that
he
should
suffer
much
for
his
insolence
when
the
queen
heard
this
she
fell
into
a
great
rage
and
cried
open
the
gate
these
fellows
shall
soon
know
to
what
a
city
they
have
come
so
the
porter
threw
wide
the
gate
and
the
three
pressed
forward
meaning
to
pass
through
but
lo
of
a
sudden
there
fell
upon
them
such
a
storm
of
arrows
that
they
had
perforce
to
halt
these
women
said
sir
artegall
are
stout
fighters
let
us
be
careful
what
we
and
when
they
halted
the
rout
set
upon
them
more
fiercely
than
ever
as
for
queen
radigund
when
she
saw
sir
turpine
and
knew
that
he
had
escaped
from
the
doom
which
she
had
decreed
for
him
and
was
now
dealing
blows
to
her
women
she
was
carried
away
with
rage
and
flew
at
him
headlong
as
a
lioness
flings
herself
at
an
ox
and
dealt
him
so
fierce
a
blow
as
brought
him
headlong
to
the
ground
and
when
she
saw
him
lying
she
set
her
foot
upon
his
neck
with
intent
to
make
him
pay
with
his
life
for
his
disparagement
of
her
authority
so
does
a
bear
stand
over
the
carcase
of
an
ox
and
seem
to
pause
awhile
to
hear
its
piteous
crying
when
sir
artegall
saw
what
had
befallen
sir
turpine
he
made
all
haste
to
help
him
and
dealt
the
queen
so
mighty
a
blow
that
it
reft
her
of
her
senses
nay
but
that
she
somewhat
broke
its
force
for
she
was
expert
in
arms
it
had
laid
her
dead
upon
the
ground
for
a
while
she
lay
without
speech
or
hearing
then
recovering
herself
she
would
have
assailed
him
with
all
her
might
for
never
before
had
she
endured
such
disgrace
but
when
her
maidens
saw
it
for
a
great
company
armed
for
battle
accompanied
her
they
thrust
themselves
between
for
they
deemed
that
she
was
not
wholly
in
fit
condition
for
fighting
thus
were
sir
artegall
and
queen
radigund
perforce
kept
apart
as
for
the
rest
talus
with
his
iron
flail
drove
them
hither
and
thither
breaking
their
bows
and
marring
their
shooting
and
they
fled
before
him
as
sheep
fly
from
a
wolf
when
evening
came
queen
radigund
bade
the
trumpeters
sound
a
recall
so
that
the
soldiers
should
cease
fighting
all
the
people
she
made
pass
back
into
the
city
and
she
caused
all
them
that
were
wounded
to
be
carried
to
houses
where
their
hurts
might
be
healed
then
sir
artegall
caused
his
tent
to
be
pitched
on
the
open
plain
not
far
from
the
gate
of
the
city
there
he
and
sir
turpine
took
their
ease
but
talus
as
was
his
custom
kept
watch
all
the
night
but
radigund
was
with
what
had
happened
that
day
never
before
had
her
pride
been
so
rebuked
she
could
not
rest
but
cast
about
in
her
mind
how
she
could
avenge
herself
for
the
shame
which
had
been
put
upon
her
that
day
and
that
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
after
a
while
she
made
this
resolve
in
her
mind
that
she
would
meet
the
knight
in
single
combat
and
make
trial
of
his
strength
for
that
her
people
should
suffer
such
waste
and
ruin
as
she
had
seen
that
day
was
a
thing
not
to
be
endured
then
she
asked
for
one
of
her
maidens
clarin
by
name
whom
she
judged
to
be
most
trustworthy
and
fit
to
do
her
errand
and
said
to
her
clarin
go
quickly
and
bear
a
message
to
the
stranger
knight
who
has
so
distressed
us
this
day
saying
that
i
will
meet
him
in
single
combat
that
we
may
see
whether
he
or
i
be
the
better
say
also
that
these
are
my
conditions
if
i
overcome
him
then
he
shall
render
me
obedience
and
be
bound
for
ever
to
my
service
and
i
if
he
should
vanquish
me
do
promise
to
do
the
same
go
therefore
taking
with
you
six
of
your
fellows
arrayed
as
finely
as
may
be
that
they
may
be
witnesses
of
this
covenant
take
with
you
also
wine
and
meats
that
he
may
eat
verily
if
i
have
my
will
he
shall
sit
hungry
many
a
day
so
the
damsel
did
as
she
was
bidden
taking
with
her
six
companions
and
meat
and
drink
also
when
she
came
to
the
gate
of
the
city
she
bade
the
trumpeter
blow
a
blast
for
warning
to
the
knights
and
when
talus
came
forth
she
said
that
she
would
fain
speak
with
his
master
so
being
brought
with
her
companions
into
the
tent
she
delivered
to
him
the
message
of
the
queen
sir
artegall
received
her
right
courteously
and
when
she
had
without
betook
himself
to
sleep
the
next
day
the
two
adversaries
made
themselves
ready
for
battle
sir
artegall
was
accoutred
as
knights
commonly
are
not
so
queen
radigund
she
wore
a
purple
cloak
embroidered
with
silver
with
ribands
of
diverse
colours
nicely
ordered
upon
it
this
cloak
for
easier
motion
she
shortened
to
her
thighs
but
when
she
pleased
she
could
let
it
fall
to
her
heels
she
had
for
defence
of
her
body
a
cuirass
of
buskins
she
had
finely
embroidered
with
bars
of
gold
at
her
side
she
had
a
scimitar
hanging
to
a
most
gorgeous
belt
her
shield
was
finely
decked
with
precious
stones
it
was
like
the
moon
when
it
is
at
the
full
in
this
guise
she
came
out
of
the
city
gate
a
noble
sight
to
see
about
her
was
a
bodyguard
of
maidens
some
of
whom
made
music
with
shawms
and
trumpets
her
people
had
pitched
a
pavilion
for
her
where
she
might
rest
till
the
fight
should
begin
after
this
sir
artegall
came
out
of
his
tent
fully
armed
and
first
entered
the
lists
nor
did
radigund
long
delay
to
follow
him
and
when
the
lists
had
been
barred
against
the
crowd
for
a
great
multitude
of
people
were
gathered
to
see
the
issue
of
the
battle
the
trumpets
sounded
the
signal
and
the
combat
began
the
queen
charged
first
in
the
most
furious
fashion
as
if
she
would
have
done
her
adversary
to
death
out
of
hand
but
he
having
had
much
experience
in
such
matters
was
not
carried
out
of
himself
by
her
rage
but
was
content
to
defend
himself
from
her
assault
the
greater
was
her
fury
the
more
calmly
did
he
bear
himself
but
when
her
strength
began
to
fail
her
then
he
took
the
other
part
even
as
a
smith
when
he
finds
the
metal
grow
soft
plies
his
hammer
with
all
his
might
even
so
did
sir
artegall
deal
blow
upon
blow
as
if
she
were
an
anvil
and
the
sparks
flew
from
her
armour
and
from
her
shield
also
for
with
this
she
guarded
herself
in
right
skilful
fashion
from
his
assault
but
now
things
began
to
go
ill
with
her
for
off
this
same
shield
the
knight
with
one
stroke
shore
away
a
full
half
so
that
her
side
for
half
its
length
was
exposed
yet
not
one
whit
was
she
dismayed
but
smiting
him
with
her
scimitar
wounded
him
on
the
thigh
making
the
blood
flow
amain
loud
did
she
boast
when
she
saw
the
blood
thinking
that
she
had
wounded
him
to
death
but
he
provoked
by
her
boasting
struck
at
her
with
all
his
might
and
when
she
put
her
shield
to
ward
the
blow
lo
this
was
shattered
altogether
and
fell
in
pieces
on
the
plain
next
as
she
was
thus
left
without
defence
he
smote
her
again
this
time
upon
the
helmet
so
that
she
fell
from
her
horse
and
lay
upon
the
plain
like
to
one
that
was
dead
when
he
saw
her
lying
thus
he
leapt
from
his
steed
and
unlaced
her
helmet
with
intent
to
sever
her
head
from
her
body
but
when
he
had
unlaced
her
helmet
lo
her
face
was
discovered
to
him
so
fair
it
was
even
though
covered
with
blood
and
sweat
that
he
stood
amazed
it
was
as
when
a
traveller
sees
the
face
of
the
moon
through
a
foggy
night
and
at
the
sight
all
the
cruel
purpose
departed
out
of
his
heart
so
great
was
his
pity
that
he
threw
his
sword
from
him
for
indeed
there
is
no
heart
so
hard
but
that
the
sight
of
beauty
will
soften
it
as
he
stood
thus
astonished
she
recovered
herself
from
her
swoon
and
saw
the
knight
standing
by
her
side
without
a
weapon
then
she
lifted
herself
from
the
ground
and
flew
upon
him
with
all
her
former
rage
he
indeed
could
but
ward
off
her
blows
with
his
shield
as
well
as
he
could
and
now
being
without
hope
he
entreated
her
to
withhold
her
hand
not
so
said
she
till
you
have
yielded
to
me
your
shield
in
token
of
nor
could
he
refuse
so
to
do
he
had
overcome
her
in
fair
fight
yet
now
was
he
himself
overcome
by
his
own
misdoing
for
he
had
of
his
own
accord
given
up
his
sword
and
so
lost
that
which
he
had
attained
then
she
struck
him
on
the
shoulder
with
the
flat
of
her
sword
in
token
that
he
was
from
henceforth
her
subject
as
for
the
unhappy
sir
turpine
he
was
indeed
born
under
an
unlucky
star
for
they
took
him
back
to
the
place
from
which
he
had
escaped
and
there
hanged
him
shamefully
by
the
heels
talus
they
could
not
take
for
all
that
they
sought
to
lay
hands
upon
him
he
laid
about
him
so
unmercifully
with
his
flail
that
they
were
right
glad
to
let
him
escape
many
did
he
wound
and
some
he
slew
the
rest
he
put
into
great
fear
yet
he
would
not
seek
to
rescue
his
lord
nay
said
he
to
himself
sir
artegall
has
yielded
himself
of
his
own
accord
and
i
must
e
en
let
him
queen
radigund
took
the
knight
who
had
thus
made
himself
her
subject
and
despoiled
him
of
all
his
arms
and
armour
and
put
upon
him
woman
s
clothing
with
a
white
apron
in
place
of
a
having
thus
arrayed
him
she
brought
him
into
a
great
chamber
on
the
walls
of
which
were
many
memorials
of
other
knights
whom
she
had
dealt
with
in
the
same
fashion
his
arms
and
armour
she
caused
to
be
hung
up
among
these
and
his
sword
lest
it
should
work
mischief
to
her
she
broke
in
twain
when
he
was
come
into
this
place
he
saw
sitting
there
many
brave
knights
whose
names
he
knew
right
well
bound
all
of
them
to
obey
the
amazon
s
law
and
spinning
and
carding
wool
this
they
did
under
constraint
for
they
were
bound
to
finish
their
task
by
the
appointed
time
nothing
being
given
them
whereon
to
dine
or
sup
but
what
they
could
earn
by
this
woman
s
work
the
queen
set
him
in
the
lowest
place
of
all
and
put
a
distaff
into
his
hands
and
bade
him
spin
flax
and
tow
truly
it
is
the
hardest
of
all
lots
to
be
a
woman
s
slave
but
he
consented
to
her
will
saying
to
himself
she
vanquished
me
in
battle
and
i
must
abide
by
my
own
after
a
while
the
queen
began
to
feel
the
beginning
of
love
for
the
knight
long
time
she
strove
against
it
thinking
shame
to
be
so
overcome
but
finding
that
her
passion
was
not
to
be
put
away
she
sent
for
the
same
clarin
whom
she
had
before
made
her
messenger
and
said
to
her
clarin
you
see
that
fairy
knight
who
has
been
made
my
subject
not
by
my
valour
but
by
his
own
honourable
mind
he
gave
me
my
life
when
it
was
lost
why
should
he
suffer
there
in
this
cruel
bondage
why
should
i
recompense
him
with
ill
for
so
good
a
deed
i
would
fain
give
him
his
freedom
yet
in
such
a
fashion
that
in
giving
it
to
him
i
may
win
his
free
goodwill
i
would
loose
him
and
yet
have
him
still
bound
to
me
not
with
the
bonds
of
violence
and
compulsion
but
of
benevolence
and
love
now
if
you
can
by
any
means
win
him
to
such
a
mood
but
without
discovering
mark
you
well
my
thought
you
will
win
a
goodly
reward
from
him
and
have
me
also
greatly
beholden
to
you
and
now
that
you
may
be
able
to
pass
freely
to
and
fro
i
give
you
this
ring
as
a
token
to
eumenias
was
the
keeper
of
the
knights
prison
go
then
my
clarin
use
to
the
best
all
thy
wits
employing
both
enticing
looks
and
fair
so
clarin
promising
that
she
would
use
her
best
endeavour
to
win
sir
artegall
to
such
thoughts
as
her
lady
desired
departed
on
her
errand
she
had
recourse
to
all
the
arts
she
knew
to
win
his
favourable
regard
and
one
day
she
said
to
him
sir
knight
you
have
had
but
an
evil
fortune
you
sit
drowned
in
despair
and
yet
you
might
raise
yourself
if
you
were
but
willing
to
something
he
was
in
doubt
what
this
speech
might
mean
and
so
made
answer
fair
damsel
that
you
regard
me
with
compassion
is
in
itself
a
kindness
for
which
i
am
in
your
debt
but
you
must
know
that
a
brave
heart
bears
with
equal
courage
fair
weather
and
foul
frowns
of
ill
fortune
or
smiles
of
prosperity
at
this
moment
my
life
is
overcast
with
cloud
yet
i
hope
for
sunshine
to
yea
answered
the
maiden
and
what
say
you
if
you
should
see
an
occasion
ready
to
your
hand
for
entering
on
better
things
truly
answered
sir
artegall
i
count
him
to
be
unworthy
of
good
fortune
who
should
not
promptly
take
such
occasion
so
that
it
come
within
his
then
said
clarin
why
do
you
not
set
about
to
win
your
liberty
by
seeking
the
favour
of
the
queen
tis
true
that
she
has
passed
her
days
in
war
yet
she
is
not
born
of
tigers
or
bears
she
scorns
the
love
of
men
yet
she
does
not
forget
that
she
is
herself
of
the
kindred
of
to
this
sir
artegall
replied
believe
me
fair
damsel
that
not
from
obstinacy
or
disdain
have
i
neglected
to
seek
her
favour
tis
lack
of
means
that
has
kept
me
back
from
so
doing
and
if
you
can
in
any
way
supply
this
lack
then
shall
i
be
bound
to
you
for
this
fish
bites
at
the
bait
said
the
damsel
to
herself
but
it
is
not
yet
surely
but
even
while
she
spoke
she
herself
foolish
maiden
that
she
was
was
caught
herself
for
as
a
fisher
who
while
he
seeks
for
the
prey
falls
into
the
brook
so
clarin
seeking
to
serve
her
mistress
s
ends
conceived
a
great
pity
for
this
captive
knight
and
from
pity
it
is
but
a
short
journey
to
love
but
her
love
she
durst
not
tell
neither
to
the
knight
lest
haply
she
should
be
disdained
nor
to
anyone
else
lest
that
by
any
means
it
should
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
queen
for
that
she
knew
would
mean
a
sure
sentence
of
death
therefore
she
kept
the
matter
in
her
heart
watching
for
such
occasion
as
might
arise
queen
radigund
growing
impatient
of
the
delay
bade
her
unfold
the
truth
how
have
you
fared
she
said
what
is
the
temper
of
the
man
has
captivity
brought
him
to
a
more
humble
mind
not
so
said
clarin
he
is
as
stern
and
obstinate
as
ever
he
scorns
all
offers
and
conditions
he
would
sooner
he
look
with
any
favour
on
those
who
have
done
him
so
great
a
wrong
this
in
brief
is
his
resolve
in
truth
these
are
his
very
words
my
body
may
be
thrall
to
the
queen
but
my
heart
is
when
she
heard
these
words
the
queen
fell
into
a
mighty
rage
but
coming
to
herself
and
perceiving
that
anger
would
profit
her
nothing
she
said
to
her
minister
clarin
what
remains
for
us
to
do
it
were
a
shame
to
have
laboured
in
vain
and
still
more
a
shame
to
sit
down
content
when
this
fellow
flouts
us
in
such
fashion
nevertheless
that
his
guilt
may
be
seen
to
be
the
greater
and
my
grace
the
more
admirable
i
will
bear
with
this
folly
of
his
till
you
shall
have
made
another
trial
of
him
and
you
i
charge
to
leave
nothing
that
can
be
done
or
said
to
work
upon
him
leave
nothing
unpromised
that
may
help
to
persuade
him
tell
him
that
he
shall
have
life
freedom
grace
and
store
of
gifts
for
by
gifts
even
the
hearts
of
gods
are
touched
and
to
these
promises
add
all
your
arts
and
woman
s
wiles
and
if
your
arts
avail
nothing
then
let
him
feel
the
weight
of
your
hand
diminish
his
victuals
maybe
he
is
too
proudly
fed
put
more
labour
upon
him
and
with
harder
conditions
let
him
lodge
less
softly
lying
upon
straw
do
aught
that
may
abate
his
courage
and
his
pride
put
a
chain
of
cold
iron
upon
him
and
deny
him
all
that
he
may
desire
and
when
you
have
done
all
this
tell
me
how
he
bears
himself
if
need
be
i
will
deal
with
him
not
as
a
lover
but
as
a
all
this
clarin
heard
and
made
pretence
to
fulfil
her
lady
s
commands
but
her
mind
was
turned
to
quite
another
thing
that
is
to
say
to
play
her
mistress
false
and
to
gain
the
knight
s
love
for
herself
to
him
therefore
she
made
as
great
a
show
of
goodwill
as
she
could
telling
him
that
she
was
making
suit
for
him
to
the
queen
that
she
should
set
him
at
liberty
but
that
she
could
not
persuade
her
the
more
i
entreat
her
she
said
the
sterner
and
the
harsher
she
then
from
the
knight
she
would
go
to
the
queen
and
say
the
more
grace
i
show
the
more
haughty
and
unbending
is
as
for
sir
artegall
he
spoke
the
woman
fair
but
never
did
he
depart
from
his
loyalty
to
his
own
fair
lady
chapter
xxxi
how
sir
artegall
was
delivered
while
sir
artegall
lay
thus
in
evil
plight
under
the
tyranny
of
queen
radigund
the
lady
britomart
was
in
no
small
distress
of
mind
for
now
the
latest
date
that
had
been
fixed
for
his
return
was
long
past
and
yet
no
tidings
of
him
had
come
sometimes
she
thought
that
some
mishap
had
befallen
him
in
his
adventure
and
sometimes
that
his
false
foe
had
entrapped
him
and
this
was
the
most
grievous
fear
of
he
had
bestowed
his
love
upon
another
she
knew
no
ill
of
him
nor
ever
had
heard
any
yet
could
she
not
forbear
to
think
now
she
blamed
herself
and
now
she
condemned
him
as
being
faithless
and
untrue
then
again
she
would
think
to
herself
surely
i
have
miscounted
the
time
and
she
reckoned
the
days
and
weeks
and
months
again
and
indeed
the
days
were
as
weeks
and
the
weeks
were
as
months
also
she
considered
within
herself
what
she
should
do
should
she
send
someone
to
search
for
him
and
yet
who
could
go
on
such
an
errand
but
herself
she
could
not
rest
in
her
dwelling
no
place
could
please
her
yet
that
which
displeased
her
least
was
a
certain
window
which
looked
towards
the
west
for
it
was
from
the
west
that
sir
artegall
was
due
to
come
it
chanced
then
that
as
she
sat
at
this
same
window
on
a
certain
day
she
saw
someone
approaching
at
full
speed
no
sooner
did
she
see
him
though
she
could
not
discern
his
face
than
she
said
to
herself
this
is
someone
from
my
and
truly
when
he
came
nearer
she
perceived
that
it
was
sir
artegall
s
groom
talus
the
sight
filled
her
heart
both
with
hopes
and
with
fears
nor
could
she
stay
in
her
place
but
ran
forth
to
meet
him
crying
where
is
your
lord
is
he
far
from
here
has
he
lost
or
has
he
won
talus
albeit
he
was
made
of
iron
and
was
without
feeling
of
pain
and
sorrow
yet
was
conscious
within
himself
that
his
news
was
ill
and
stood
silent
as
if
he
would
rather
that
she
should
discern
his
tidings
than
that
he
should
declare
them
then
she
said
take
courage
talus
tell
me
what
you
have
to
tell
be
it
good
or
be
it
then
he
answered
if
i
must
tell
my
evil
tidings
so
be
it
my
lord
lies
in
wretched
how
came
that
to
pass
said
britomart
did
the
tyrant
his
enemy
vanquish
him
not
so
quoth
talus
no
tyrant
man
did
vanquish
him
but
a
tyrant
great
was
the
rage
of
britomart
when
she
heard
these
words
and
you
are
not
ashamed
evil
newsmonger
to
come
here
with
such
tidings
of
your
lord
s
disgrace
and
she
turned
her
back
upon
him
seeking
her
own
chamber
and
there
with
much
she
spent
many
weary
hours
the
next
day
she
sought
out
talus
again
and
being
now
in
a
milder
mood
she
said
tell
me
now
plainly
how
came
sir
artegall
into
this
captivity
does
he
woo
this
tyrant
lady
ah
madam
answered
talus
he
is
in
no
state
to
woo
he
lies
in
thraldom
weak
and
wan
and
yet
for
the
truth
must
be
told
it
was
by
his
own
doing
that
he
came
into
this
then
britomart
s
anger
was
kindled
again
are
you
not
leagued
together
to
deceive
me
you
say
that
he
came
into
this
bondage
of
his
own
accord
is
he
not
then
false
then
talus
unfolded
the
whole
story
of
how
sir
artegall
fought
and
how
he
was
vanquished
not
by
the
strength
of
his
adversary
but
by
his
own
compassion
when
britomart
heard
this
same
story
she
was
so
to
speak
torn
asunder
by
anger
and
grief
nor
would
anything
content
her
but
that
she
must
straightway
put
on
her
armour
mount
her
horse
and
ride
forth
to
deliver
sir
artegall
talus
being
her
guide
after
they
had
ridden
for
a
space
they
came
upon
a
knight
who
was
riding
slowly
across
the
plain
a
man
well
stricken
in
years
and
of
a
very
modest
and
peaceable
bearing
he
saluted
britomart
right
courteously
and
she
though
in
her
sad
mood
she
would
sooner
have
remained
without
speech
answered
him
pleasantly
then
he
began
to
talk
of
many
things
and
she
though
wholly
occupied
in
her
mind
with
one
matter
to
wit
the
deliverance
of
sir
artegall
from
his
prison
made
such
replies
as
were
suitable
after
some
converse
he
said
friend
night
is
about
to
fall
and
there
are
tokens
of
rain
in
the
heavens
will
you
not
lodge
with
me
at
my
house
and
britomart
seeing
that
the
day
was
far
spent
consented
they
rode
therefore
to
the
knight
s
dwelling
which
was
indeed
hard
by
there
he
most
hospitably
entertained
them
both
with
good
cheer
and
pleasant
conversation
when
the
hour
of
rest
came
britomart
was
conducted
to
the
bower
where
she
should
sleep
there
she
found
grooms
who
offered
to
undress
her
but
she
would
not
doff
her
arms
for
all
her
host
s
entreaties
nay
she
said
i
have
vowed
a
vow
that
i
will
not
take
off
these
arms
till
i
have
taken
vengeance
for
a
great
wrong
that
has
been
done
to
when
she
made
this
answer
it
might
have
been
perceived
that
her
host
was
somewhat
troubled
nevertheless
he
took
his
leave
right
courteously
and
departed
britomart
watched
all
the
night
if
sleep
seemed
about
to
settle
for
a
moment
on
her
eyes
she
shook
it
off
with
a
right
resolute
will
and
talus
watched
also
outside
her
door
did
he
lie
in
no
small
trouble
of
mind
as
a
dog
that
keeps
guard
over
his
master
s
chamber
so
night
passed
but
about
the
dawn
when
the
cock
commonly
crows
for
the
first
time
britomart
perceived
that
the
bed
in
her
chamber
began
to
sink
through
the
floor
and
that
after
awhile
it
was
raised
again
and
while
she
waited
to
see
what
this
might
mean
though
indeed
it
was
clear
that
it
meant
treachery
of
some
sort
there
came
two
knights
to
her
chamber
door
with
a
rabble
rout
of
followers
after
them
but
these
came
on
a
vain
errand
talus
having
his
iron
flail
ready
to
his
hand
laid
about
him
with
a
right
goodwill
they
fled
before
him
both
knights
and
the
rabble
also
some
he
struck
to
the
ground
as
they
fled
and
others
as
they
strove
to
hide
themselves
in
dark
corners
of
the
house
now
the
true
story
of
the
matter
is
this
this
knight
who
seemed
so
gentle
and
courteous
was
one
dolon
a
man
of
great
cunning
and
of
an
evil
mind
he
had
been
a
knight
in
his
youth
yet
had
achieved
no
honour
only
by
his
craft
he
had
undone
many
men
who
were
better
than
himself
three
sons
he
had
of
the
same
temper
as
himself
full
of
fraud
and
guile
one
of
these
the
eldest
in
birth
guizor
by
name
had
been
slain
by
sir
artegall
in
battle
not
without
his
deserving
for
he
had
sought
to
compass
some
treachery
and
now
this
dolon
would
have
taken
vengeance
for
this
injury
britomart
he
took
for
sir
artegall
chiefly
by
reason
of
the
page
talus
with
the
iron
flail
whom
he
had
seen
in
his
company
the
next
day
so
soon
as
it
was
light
britomart
departed
and
when
the
two
knights
would
have
stayed
her
going
and
this
on
the
bridge
where
artegall
had
fought
pollenté
she
vanquished
them
and
one
she
caught
up
in
her
arms
and
carrying
him
to
the
bridge
end
cast
him
into
the
water
where
he
perished
miserably
after
journeying
awhile
britomart
with
talus
her
guide
came
to
the
city
of
queen
radigund
the
queen
when
she
was
advised
of
her
coming
was
greatly
rejoiced
for
she
had
not
had
the
great
joy
of
battle
for
many
days
and
it
always
pleased
her
greatly
to
have
experience
of
a
new
adversary
she
commanded
that
a
pavilion
should
be
set
up
outside
the
city
gate
for
the
there
britomart
rested
that
night
talus
keeping
watch
as
was
his
wont
at
the
door
the
townsfolk
also
kept
watch
upon
the
walls
at
sunrise
the
queen
caused
a
trumpet
to
be
blown
to
warn
the
stranger
that
the
hour
of
battle
was
come
such
warning
britomart
needed
not
for
she
had
slept
but
ill
so
troubled
was
she
in
heart
with
jealousy
and
anger
then
the
two
made
ready
for
the
combat
but
first
the
queen
would
have
her
adversary
bind
herself
to
perpetual
service
if
the
fortune
of
the
day
should
go
against
her
but
britomart
cried
i
will
have
no
such
conditions
no
terms
will
i
accept
but
such
as
are
prescribed
by
the
laws
of
chivalry
then
the
trumpets
sounded
again
and
the
two
ran
at
each
other
with
great
fury
it
seemed
to
them
who
looked
on
that
both
the
one
and
the
other
had
forgotten
all
their
skill
in
arms
so
possessed
were
they
with
rage
they
sought
not
to
ward
off
blows
but
only
to
strike
and
indeed
none
could
have
said
who
struck
the
harder
at
last
radigund
thinking
that
she
had
her
adversary
at
a
disadvantage
dealt
her
a
blow
with
all
her
might
saying
at
the
same
time
you
love
this
man
here
then
is
a
token
of
your
love
which
you
may
show
him
for
what
could
be
a
surer
proof
than
to
die
for
him
but
britomart
answered
have
done
with
idle
words
about
my
love
and
though
she
was
sorely
wounded
by
the
stroke
for
the
blade
breaking
through
the
of
her
armour
bit
to
the
bone
she
gave
in
return
even
more
than
she
had
received
the
sharpness
of
the
pain
gave
a
new
force
to
her
arm
and
she
struck
the
queen
so
fierce
a
blow
on
the
head
that
it
broke
through
her
helmet
and
laid
her
senseless
on
the
ground
nor
did
britomart
wait
for
her
adversary
to
recover
herself
but
urged
by
injured
love
and
pride
and
the
fresh
smarting
of
her
wound
with
one
blow
cleft
both
helmet
and
head
when
her
guards
perceived
this
dreadful
sight
they
fled
headlong
to
the
city
but
did
not
so
escape
for
talus
taking
up
his
flail
entered
at
the
gate
along
with
the
rout
of
fugitives
and
dealt
death
in
every
direction
small
need
had
they
i
ween
of
a
physician
on
whom
one
of
his
strokes
had
lighted
verily
he
had
destroyed
them
all
but
that
the
heart
of
britomart
was
moved
to
see
such
great
slaughter
hold
your
hand
she
cried
it
is
enough
then
she
commanded
that
someone
should
lead
her
to
the
prison
where
sir
artegall
was
kept
in
bonds
much
was
she
moved
to
see
these
knights
in
their
womanish
attire
plying
distaff
and
spindle
but
when
she
espied
sir
artegall
himself
and
saw
how
pale
and
wan
and
wasted
he
was
her
heart
was
broken
in
her
breast
bitterly
did
she
repent
of
her
unkind
suspicions
this
was
no
lover
of
women
whom
she
saw
before
her
in
so
sad
a
plight
then
she
bade
take
him
to
a
chamber
where
he
might
put
off
these
uncomely
garments
and
put
on
the
apparel
that
belonged
to
a
knight
and
take
again
his
arms
and
armour
of
which
there
was
a
great
store
in
the
place
not
a
little
rejoiced
was
she
when
she
saw
how
he
became
again
like
to
the
knight
whom
she
had
seen
long
since
in
the
magic
mirror
for
a
while
they
tarried
in
the
city
for
he
needed
to
rest
and
she
had
wounds
which
it
was
well
to
heal
and
she
being
now
queen
of
the
land
in
the
place
of
the
dead
radigund
wholly
changed
the
form
of
the
commonwealth
she
did
away
with
this
same
monstrous
rule
of
women
and
ordered
all
things
according
to
the
ordering
of
nature
and
showed
such
justice
and
wisdom
that
the
people
gladly
made
submission
to
her
government
the
knights
whom
she
found
in
the
she
set
free
and
made
them
rulers
in
the
city
having
first
caused
them
to
take
an
oath
to
be
loyal
to
sir
artegall
there
was
but
one
thing
that
troubled
her
to
wit
that
her
lover
must
now
proceed
on
the
errand
to
which
he
was
bound
this
he
did
in
not
many
days
time
talus
travelling
with
him
as
before
after
a
while
they
saw
a
damsel
on
a
palfrey
flying
as
fast
as
she
could
and
two
knights
pursuing
her
also
at
their
utmost
speed
they
saw
also
how
another
knight
was
riding
after
these
two
each
was
intent
on
his
own
business
the
two
knights
on
chasing
the
damsel
the
single
knight
on
chasing
the
two
the
damsel
seeking
if
by
any
means
she
could
escape
but
when
she
saw
sir
artegall
being
at
her
wits
end
she
turned
her
course
towards
him
hoping
that
he
might
give
her
help
the
foremost
of
her
knights
both
of
his
course
and
with
his
spear
in
rest
charged
sir
artegall
but
there
he
had
met
more
than
his
match
the
christian
was
both
stronger
and
more
skilful
in
arms
and
drove
him
out
of
the
saddle
full
two
spears
length
and
it
so
chanced
that
in
falling
he
lighted
on
his
head
and
so
was
killed
outright
meanwhile
his
companion
had
fared
as
ill
for
the
single
knight
overtaking
him
had
compelled
him
to
stand
and
do
battle
in
which
battle
he
was
defeated
and
slain
this
done
he
still
followed
and
taking
sir
artegall
for
the
other
pagan
charged
him
at
full
tilt
they
met
with
a
great
crash
and
both
their
spears
were
broken
and
though
neither
was
driven
from
his
saddle
yet
they
tottered
as
two
towers
which
an
earthquake
makes
to
rock
but
when
they
drew
their
swords
to
renew
the
combat
the
damsel
seeing
that
her
two
friends
were
like
to
come
to
as
ill
an
end
as
had
her
two
foes
ran
up
crying
out
oh
sirs
stay
your
hands
till
i
shall
tell
you
how
the
matter
stands
tis
i
that
have
been
wronged
and
you
have
brought
me
help
slaying
these
two
pagans
who
were
pursuing
me
these
lie
dead
upon
the
ground
what
quarrel
have
you
against
each
other
if
there
be
still
any
wrongdoer
or
cause
of
trouble
truly
it
is
when
the
two
heard
these
words
they
held
their
hands
and
lifting
up
the
visors
of
their
helmets
looked
each
in
the
other
s
face
and
when
sir
artegall
saw
the
last
comer
who
was
no
other
than
prince
arthur
he
was
sure
that
he
was
a
very
noble
knight
and
said
pardon
me
fair
sir
that
i
have
erred
in
lifting
my
hand
against
you
i
will
make
what
amends
you
talk
not
of
amends
answered
the
prince
i
was
in
equal
error
taking
you
for
this
dead
so
they
swore
friendship
and
made
a
covenant
of
mutual
help
then
said
sir
artegall
tell
me
sir
who
were
these
knights
that
have
come
by
this
bad
end
that
i
know
not
answered
the
prince
but
know
that
this
damsel
was
in
distress
and
that
i
sought
to
succour
her
but
doubtless
she
herself
will
unfold
the
whole
matter
to
then
the
damsel
told
her
story
know
sirs
she
said
that
i
serve
a
maiden
queen
of
these
parts
mercilla
by
name
a
lady
known
far
and
wide
and
envied
also
for
her
prosperity
and
her
goodness
enemies
she
has
and
chief
among
these
is
a
pagan
prince
who
is
bent
on
overthrowing
her
kingdom
yea
verily
and
on
slaying
her
sacred
self
to
this
wickedness
he
is
stirred
up
by
his
evil
wife
adikia
by
name
tis
she
who
trusting
in
her
power
moves
him
to
all
kinds
of
wrong
now
my
liege
lady
being
desirous
of
peace
and
willing
for
sake
of
it
to
give
up
something
of
her
just
right
sent
me
to
make
a
treaty
with
this
same
adikia
so
that
there
might
be
quietness
in
the
land
now
as
you
know
it
has
been
a
custom
of
all
time
that
such
messengers
have
liberty
to
come
and
go
without
hindrance
or
harm
but
this
evil
woman
without
any
offence
given
on
my
part
broke
forth
in
railing
upon
me
and
not
only
this
but
thrust
me
from
her
door
as
if
i
were
a
dog
yea
and
when
i
had
departed
she
sent
these
two
knights
after
me
to
take
me
prisoner
to
you
therefore
for
myself
and
for
the
queen
whose
messenger
i
am
i
render
you
most
hearty
when
they
had
heard
the
damsel
s
story
the
two
knights
sir
artegall
and
prince
arthur
counselled
together
what
should
be
done
in
this
matter
of
which
consultation
the
conclusion
was
that
they
should
punish
those
who
were
guilty
of
this
wrongdoing
that
is
to
say
the
sultan
and
his
wife
and
the
knights
who
lent
themselves
to
do
their
evil
will
further
they
concluded
to
carry
out
this
purpose
in
the
way
now
to
be
described
sir
artegall
should
disguise
himself
in
the
accoutrements
of
one
of
the
dead
pagan
knights
and
should
take
with
him
the
damsel
to
the
sultan
s
court
making
as
though
she
was
his
prisoner
sir
artegall
therefore
having
donned
the
armour
of
one
of
the
two
knights
took
the
damsel
with
him
as
being
a
prisoner
and
so
came
to
the
sultan
s
court
and
the
sultan
s
wife
who
chanced
to
be
looking
from
the
window
saw
them
and
did
not
doubt
but
that
her
errand
had
been
performed
and
sent
a
page
who
would
show
the
knight
what
he
should
do
the
page
therefore
brought
them
to
the
place
appointed
but
when
he
would
have
eased
sir
artegall
of
his
armour
the
knight
refused
for
he
feared
to
be
discovered
meanwhile
prince
arthur
coming
to
the
gate
of
the
city
sent
to
the
sultan
this
message
i
demand
that
there
be
delivered
to
me
the
lady
samient
was
the
damsel
s
being
the
ambassador
of
queen
mercilla
whom
you
wrongfully
detain
in
when
the
sultan
heard
this
message
he
was
filled
with
anger
and
commanded
that
his
armour
should
be
brought
this
he
straightway
put
on
and
mounted
his
chariot
this
same
was
armed
in
dreadful
fashion
with
iron
hooks
and
scythes
and
was
drawn
by
savage
horses
whom
he
was
wont
to
feed
on
the
flesh
of
men
the
poor
wretches
whom
in
his
cruelty
he
slew
he
was
wont
to
give
when
they
were
but
half
dead
to
these
beasts
in
this
guise
he
came
forth
from
the
city
gates
where
he
found
prince
arthur
awaiting
him
mounted
on
his
steed
with
talus
standing
at
his
stirrup
the
sultan
drove
straight
at
his
adversary
thinking
to
overthrow
him
by
the
rush
of
his
chariot
and
that
his
horses
would
trample
him
in
the
dust
but
the
prince
perceiving
his
design
withdrew
himself
a
pace
and
so
escaped
the
danger
nor
was
he
hurt
by
the
dart
which
the
sultan
cast
at
him
as
he
passed
this
also
he
avoided
and
it
was
well
that
he
did
so
else
of
a
certainty
it
had
pierced
either
him
or
his
horse
from
side
to
side
but
when
prince
arthur
sought
to
approach
the
sultan
the
horses
carried
the
chariot
out
of
his
reach
so
swift
of
foot
were
they
on
the
other
hand
the
sultan
having
a
store
of
darts
ready
to
his
hand
in
the
chariot
cast
them
at
the
prince
and
with
one
of
them
pierced
the
prince
s
cuirass
and
made
a
grievous
wound
in
his
side
so
did
the
combat
rage
between
these
two
the
prince
being
at
this
disadvantage
also
that
his
horse
could
not
endure
the
look
of
the
sultan
s
horses
so
fierce
and
fiery
of
aspect
were
they
at
the
last
finding
that
all
other
means
were
of
no
avail
he
drew
the
covering
from
his
thing
which
he
was
not
wont
to
do
save
in
the
last
held
it
so
that
the
light
shining
from
it
fell
full
on
the
eyes
of
the
sultan
s
horses
as
a
flash
of
lightning
did
it
fall
upon
them
and
they
straightway
turned
and
fled
nor
could
the
sultan
stay
their
flight
the
reins
were
of
no
avail
they
heeded
them
not
and
when
he
called
to
them
they
would
not
hear
over
hill
and
dale
they
carried
him
he
vainly
dragging
at
the
reins
and
cursing
aloud
while
the
chariot
swaying
from
side
to
side
tossed
him
to
and
fro
still
the
prince
followed
close
behind
but
still
found
no
opportunity
to
strike
nor
indeed
had
he
need
for
coming
to
some
rocky
ground
the
horses
overset
the
chariot
and
the
sultan
was
torn
in
pieces
by
his
own
contrivance
of
scythes
and
hooks
then
the
prince
took
up
his
shield
and
armour
from
where
they
lay
sorely
bent
and
broken
upon
the
ground
these
he
carried
back
to
the
city
and
hanged
them
on
a
tree
before
the
palace
door
when
the
wicked
wife
saw
what
had
happened
she
ran
down
from
her
chamber
like
to
one
mad
saying
to
herself
i
will
be
avenged
on
that
damsel
who
has
brought
upon
me
all
this
and
she
ran
knife
in
hand
to
the
place
where
she
had
been
put
but
sir
artegall
stayed
her
hand
and
she
being
made
yet
more
furious
ran
forth
into
the
woods
and
there
abode
in
the
some
men
a
tigress
sir
artegall
meanwhile
vanquished
the
sultan
s
knights
and
established
a
new
order
in
the
city
chapter
xxxii
of
the
knave
malengin
the
two
knights
delivered
the
city
when
they
had
ordered
it
anew
to
the
lady
samient
to
hold
for
queen
mercilla
this
done
they
would
have
departed
on
their
own
business
but
samient
was
not
content
that
they
should
depart
without
seeing
the
queen
and
this
overborne
by
her
entreaties
they
consented
to
do
as
they
journeyed
the
damsel
said
to
them
there
abides
in
this
region
a
very
sturdy
villain
who
is
wont
to
rob
all
the
country
round
about
and
carries
the
spoil
to
a
rock
which
he
makes
his
dwelling
and
to
this
place
no
man
can
get
so
hard
of
access
is
it
also
he
is
marvellously
light
of
hand
and
nimble
of
foot
smooth
of
face
and
so
subtle
in
his
talk
that
he
can
deceive
when
the
two
knights
heard
this
tale
they
desired
with
one
accord
that
the
damsel
should
take
them
to
the
place
where
this
villain
abode
that
would
i
willingly
do
said
she
only
that
the
going
thither
would
hinder
your
journey
to
queen
let
not
that
stay
you
said
the
prince
and
sir
artegall
gave
also
his
consent
so
they
travelled
onwards
together
after
a
while
the
damsel
said
to
the
knights
we
are
close
to
the
place
then
sir
artegall
and
prince
arthur
consulted
together
what
was
best
to
be
done
they
agreed
that
the
damsel
should
sit
by
the
robber
s
cave
and
raise
a
great
uproar
and
that
when
he
should
come
to
see
what
was
the
cause
of
the
disturbance
they
should
set
upon
him
and
hinder
his
return
so
the
lady
samient
went
to
the
cave
and
there
threw
herself
upon
the
ground
and
then
made
a
great
uproar
with
much
wailing
and
many
cries
of
grief
when
the
villain
heard
it
he
came
forth
from
his
den
thinking
that
something
had
come
in
his
way
a
dreadful
creature
he
was
to
see
with
hollow
eyes
and
long
curling
hair
which
fell
over
his
shoulders
and
a
most
uncouth
and
ragged
garment
in
his
hand
he
carried
a
long
staff
with
iron
hooks
at
the
end
of
it
and
on
his
back
he
bore
a
wide
net
this
he
used
not
for
fishing
in
the
brook
but
to
catch
such
prey
as
he
desired
on
the
dry
land
taking
them
unawares
when
the
damsel
saw
this
strange
creature
standing
close
by
her
she
was
not
a
little
dismayed
and
cried
out
for
help
in
good
earnest
but
he
with
guileful
words
would
have
persuaded
her
that
she
had
nothing
to
fear
and
then
while
she
listened
as
she
could
scarce
refrain
from
doing
suddenly
he
threw
his
net
about
her
and
lifting
her
from
the
ground
ran
with
her
to
his
cave
but
when
as
he
came
near
to
the
cave
mouth
he
saw
the
two
knights
barring
the
way
he
threw
down
on
the
ground
his
net
with
its
burden
and
fled
away
like
to
a
wild
goat
did
he
leap
from
rock
to
rock
and
he
ran
along
the
without
fear
into
places
where
sir
artegall
for
all
his
courage
durst
not
follow
him
so
the
knight
sent
his
iron
man
talus
to
follow
him
and
when
the
knave
saw
that
the
was
not
less
swift
of
foot
than
he
was
himself
and
did
not
grow
weary
or
scant
of
breath
then
he
left
running
on
the
hills
and
came
down
again
to
the
plain
and
here
he
had
recourse
to
a
new
device
changing
himself
into
various
shapes
first
he
made
himself
into
a
fox
but
talus
was
not
slow
to
hunt
him
as
a
fox
is
hunted
then
into
a
bush
but
the
iron
man
beat
the
bush
with
his
flail
and
from
the
bush
he
made
himself
into
a
bird
but
talus
threw
stones
at
the
bird
and
with
so
sure
an
aim
that
he
soon
brought
it
to
the
ground
as
if
it
had
been
itself
a
stone
this
talus
took
from
the
ground
and
brought
it
to
the
knights
and
gave
it
to
sir
artegall
saying
at
the
same
time
take
it
sir
knight
but
beware
hold
it
fast
and
lo
even
while
he
held
it
fast
it
was
changed
into
a
hedgehog
and
pricked
the
knight
s
hand
so
sorely
that
he
threw
it
away
and
the
villain
returned
to
his
own
shape
and
would
have
fled
but
when
talus
perceived
it
he
followed
and
overtook
him
and
led
him
back
then
did
he
change
himself
into
a
snake
but
this
talus
struck
so
heavily
with
his
iron
flail
that
he
broke
all
his
bones
and
left
him
dead
for
the
fowls
of
the
air
to
devour
after
this
they
came
to
the
palace
of
queen
mercilla
as
fair
and
noble
a
palace
as
was
ever
seen
upon
the
earth
the
porch
stood
open
day
and
night
so
that
all
comers
might
enter
in
but
a
warder
of
giant
form
sat
there
to
keep
from
entering
all
that
harboured
guile
or
malice
and
such
as
with
flattery
and
dissembling
work
such
harm
in
the
courts
of
kings
the
warder
s
name
was
awe
such
as
were
permitted
to
pass
in
were
marshalled
in
the
hall
by
another
warder
whose
name
was
order
there
they
saw
many
noteworthy
things
and
chief
of
all
the
queen
mercilla
herself
where
she
sat
on
her
throne
with
a
sceptre
in
her
hand
a
pledge
of
peace
and
clemency
and
under
her
feet
lay
a
great
lion
very
fierce
of
nature
but
wholly
tamed
in
that
presence
so
then
the
two
did
obeisance
and
stood
aside
while
the
queen
judged
affairs
of
state
and
ministered
justice
and
equity
to
her
people
of
all
these
affairs
the
chiefest
was
the
trial
of
a
great
lady
who
stood
before
the
throne
most
fair
and
royally
arrayed
many
accusations
were
brought
against
this
lady
the
prosecutor
being
one
zeal
nor
could
this
be
wondered
at
for
this
great
lady
was
no
other
than
the
false
duessa
it
was
surely
proved
against
her
that
she
had
deceived
knights
and
brought
them
to
shame
and
even
to
death
also
that
she
had
wrought
upon
two
vain
knights
blandamour
and
paridell
to
devise
hostility
against
queen
mercilla
herself
sir
artegall
was
so
moved
by
these
accusations
that
being
a
lover
of
justice
he
was
firm
in
taking
the
contrary
part
against
her
prince
arthur
on
the
other
hand
was
not
a
little
touched
by
the
pleadings
on
her
behalf
when
all
had
been
heard
on
either
side
queen
mercilla
gave
judgment
and
although
duessa
s
guilt
was
clear
beyond
all
doubt
yet
she
being
true
to
name
and
nature
did
not
adjudge
the
extreme
penalty
of
death
but
ordered
that
she
should
be
so
kept
as
not
to
do
any
mischief

chapter
xxxiii
of
the
lady
belgé
while
the
two
knights
tarried
at
the
court
of
queen
mercilla
being
entertained
by
her
in
the
most
liberal
fashion
there
came
two
youths
from
a
foreign
land
praying
for
help
for
their
mother
the
lady
belgé
it
was
a
piteous
story
that
they
told
before
the
queen
mercilla
and
all
the
knights
and
ladies
of
her
court
the
lady
belgé
had
been
in
former
days
among
the
most
fortunate
of
women
she
had
to
husband
a
most
worthy
and
noble
prince
of
wide
dominions
and
great
wealth
she
had
also
a
very
fair
progeny
even
seventeen
sons
fair
children
and
of
great
promise
anyone
who
saw
them
in
those
days
would
surely
have
said
that
not
niobé
herself
before
she
moved
the
wrath
of
apollo
and
diana
was
more
blessed
in
her
progeny
now
the
beginning
of
troubles
to
this
honourable
lady
was
that
her
husband
died
in
his
prime
before
any
of
his
children
had
come
to
such
an
age
that
they
could
fill
his
place
and
because
the
times
were
to
a
woman
s
rule
she
was
constrained
to
look
for
someone
who
should
give
her
help
and
protection
now
there
was
in
those
parts
a
monstrous
creature
geryoneo
by
name
son
of
that
geryon
who
was
slain
by
hercules
he
was
terrible
to
look
upon
and
marvellously
strong
for
he
had
three
bodies
joined
in
one
the
legs
and
arms
of
three
men
as
it
were
to
help
him
in
the
fighting
he
feigning
himself
to
be
just
and
kind
proffered
his
service
to
the
lady
belgé
while
she
was
yet
in
the
first
trouble
of
her
widowhood
undertaking
to
defend
her
against
all
enemies
both
from
within
and
from
without
this
proffer
she
gladly
accepted
and
he
for
a
time
kept
the
promise
which
he
had
made
well
and
loyally
but
having
established
himself
in
the
country
and
belgé
having
given
into
his
hands
all
the
power
he
began
to
bear
himself
most
cruelly
many
wrongs
did
he
do
to
this
most
unhappy
lady
but
of
all
the
wrongs
the
worst
was
this
that
he
took
of
her
children
one
after
another
to
offer
up
in
sacrifice
to
a
horrible
idol
which
he
had
made
of
his
father
geryon
twelve
had
he
taken
one
by
one
so
that
now
there
were
left
to
the
unhappy
mother
but
five
only
and
now
all
other
hope
having
been
lost
she
bethought
her
of
the
gracious
queen
mercilla
and
sent
her
two
eldest
sons
to
entreat
her
help
when
they
had
told
their
story
there
was
for
a
while
silence
in
the
court
no
one
caring
to
take
this
adventure
upon
himself
and
when
prince
arthur
saw
that
no
one
offered
himself
he
stood
forth
and
said
grant
me
leave
gracious
queen
to
succour
this
distressed
lady
readily
do
i
grant
it
said
the
queen
thereupon
he
began
straightway
to
prepare
himself
for
his
journey
for
he
would
not
lose
time
even
on
the
morrow
would
he
start
on
this
adventure
and
so
it
was
so
soon
as
the
next
morning
came
the
prince
set
forth
not
without
gifts
from
the
queen
sir
artegall
he
left
to
follow
his
own
business
but
the
two
young
sons
of
the
lady
belgé
went
with
him
guiding
him
on
his
way
it
was
but
a
short
journey
to
the
place
where
the
lady
belgé
dwelt
the
tyrant
had
shut
her
out
from
the
cities
of
her
land
and
from
all
the
pleasant
spots
she
had
her
abode
in
the
midst
of
marshes
and
fens
and
was
glad
to
find
shelter
in
them
from
the
cruelty
of
her
oppressor
in
such
a
dismal
region
did
prince
arthur
find
her
living
quite
alone
for
her
children
had
left
her
seeking
safety
elsewhere
and
she
herself
when
she
caught
sight
of
a
man
clad
in
armour
made
ready
to
fly
but
then
spying
her
own
two
sons
she
took
heart
and
looked
up
joyfully
for
she
knew
that
the
stranger
was
come
to
give
her
help
then
she
threw
her
arms
round
the
necks
of
the
two
lads
as
they
knelt
before
her
crying
oh
my
sweet
boys
now
i
seem
to
live
again
so
joyful
a
thing
is
it
to
see
you
surely
the
sun
shines
brighter
than
its
wont
thanks
to
your
coming
and
to
the
presence
of
this
noble
then
turning
to
prince
arthur
she
said
noble
sir
who
have
taken
all
this
trouble
to
help
a
miserable
woman
may
heaven
reward
you
for
your
goodness
reward
have
i
none
to
give
for
all
that
is
left
to
me
is
bare
life
and
that
life
so
full
of
misery
that
it
is
more
like
to
a
lingering
death
the
prince
was
not
a
little
moved
at
these
sorrowful
words
and
sought
to
comfort
her
take
heart
dear
lady
he
said
for
help
is
at
hand
and
these
your
troubles
will
have
an
end
but
now
come
with
me
and
find
some
spot
where
you
may
more
conveniently
dwell
than
in
this
miserable
ah
sir
she
answered
to
what
place
shall
i
go
the
enemy
dwells
in
my
palaces
my
cities
are
sacked
my
towers
are
levelled
with
the
ground
and
what
were
abodes
of
men
are
fields
where
the
wild
flowers
grow
only
these
marshes
the
abode
of
efts
and
frogs
are
left
to
nay
good
lady
answered
the
prince
think
better
things
than
these
we
will
find
some
place
to
harbour
us
and
if
it
yield
not
itself
willingly
then
will
we
compel
it
for
all
that
your
adversary
may
do
we
will
purchase
it
with
spear
and
shield
and
if
not
then
the
open
field
shall
give
us
welcome
earth
has
a
lodging
for
all
its
with
such
words
did
the
prince
encourage
her
so
that
she
made
ready
to
go
with
him
they
set
out
therefore
and
came
to
a
city
which
once
had
been
the
lady
belgé
s
own
but
had
been
taken
from
her
by
her
enemy
he
had
pulled
down
its
stately
towers
closed
its
harbour
marred
the
trade
of
its
merchants
and
brought
its
people
to
poverty
and
he
had
built
a
great
fort
from
which
he
dominated
the
place
for
a
while
the
city
had
resisted
his
tyranny
but
had
now
submitted
itself
to
him
so
purchasing
life
but
losing
all
else
that
is
worth
the
having
many
things
did
it
suffer
from
his
tyranny
but
of
all
that
it
endured
the
worst
was
this
that
it
was
compelled
to
offer
sacrifices
of
human
life
to
a
hideous
idol
which
the
tyrant
had
set
up
in
a
chapel
which
he
had
built
and
adorned
with
costliest
fittings
of
gold
and
ivory
in
this
city
he
had
put
a
strong
garrison
and
in
command
of
this
garrison
he
had
set
a
seneschal
a
very
stalwart
knight
who
had
vanquished
hitherto
all
the
knights
that
had
ventured
to
come
against
him
he
had
vanquished
them
and
when
he
had
them
in
his
power
he
had
dealt
with
them
in
the
most
shameful
fashion
illustration
prince
arthur
slaying
the
seneschal
when
the
lady
belgé
knew
the
place
she
said
to
the
prince
oh
sir
beware
what
you
venture
very
many
knights
have
been
undone
at
this
to
this
warning
he
paid
no
heed
but
riding
up
to
the
wall
of
the
city
called
to
the
watchmen
i
challenge
to
single
combat
the
seneschal
of
this
nor
did
the
man
delay
to
come
but
donning
his
armour
rode
forth
from
the
city
gate
the
two
combatants
met
in
full
tilt
in
the
open
field
charging
each
the
other
with
his
spear
full
upon
the
shield
but
the
spear
of
the
seneschal
made
no
way
of
so
pure
and
a
metal
was
the
prince
s
shield
broken
was
it
into
pieces
without
number
but
the
spear
of
the
prince
passed
through
the
pagan
s
cuirass
and
made
a
deep
wound
in
his
body
so
that
he
fell
from
his
horse
to
the
ground
there
the
prince
left
him
to
lie
for
he
was
dead
almost
before
he
touched
the
ground
and
rode
straight
to
the
fortress
seeking
entrance
but
as
he
rode
he
spied
three
knights
advancing
towards
him
at
the
top
speed
of
their
horses
all
three
charged
him
at
once
all
aiming
their
spears
at
one
place
in
his
armour
but
the
prince
did
not
swerve
from
his
straight
seat
in
his
saddle
no
not
by
a
hair
firm
as
a
tower
he
sat
and
with
his
spear
he
smote
that
one
of
the
three
who
had
the
middle
place
nor
was
his
smiting
in
vain
for
he
drove
the
spear
through
the
shield
and
through
the
side
of
the
man
so
that
he
fell
dead
on
his
when
his
fellows
saw
how
easily
he
had
been
overcome
they
fled
away
as
fast
as
their
steeds
could
carry
them
but
the
prince
followed
yet
faster
and
overtook
them
hard
by
the
city
gate
there
as
they
hasted
to
enter
one
hindered
the
other
and
the
prince
slew
the
hindmost
the
third
striving
to
shut
the
gate
in
his
adversary
s
face
was
hindered
by
the
carcase
of
his
companion
for
it
lay
in
the
way
so
he
fled
into
the
hall
which
stood
at
the
entering
in
of
the
gate
hoping
so
to
save
himself
but
the
prince
following
hard
after
him
slew
him
there
when
they
that
were
left
of
the
garrison
saw
how
it
had
gone
with
these
three
they
were
sore
afraid
and
fled
in
great
terror
escaping
by
a
postern
door
when
the
prince
found
no
more
to
oppose
him
he
returned
to
the
lady
belgé
and
brought
her
into
the
city
her
two
sons
being
with
her
many
thanks
did
she
render
for
the
good
service
which
he
had
done
her
when
the
tidings
of
what
had
befallen
the
seneschal
and
his
knights
came
to
the
sultan
he
was
carried
out
of
himself
with
rage
nevertheless
there
was
something
of
fear
mingled
with
his
rage
for
his
conscience
smote
him
with
the
thought
that
the
recompense
of
his
evil
deeds
was
at
hand
nevertheless
he
comforted
himself
with
this
there
is
but
one
of
them
and
he
can
not
always
therefore
he
armed
himself
also
he
took
with
him
all
the
followers
that
he
had
and
marched
to
the
gate
of
the
city
and
there
demanded
entrance
saying
yield
me
up
this
place
straightway
for
it
is
my
to
this
summons
the
prince
made
no
answer
but
rode
forth
through
the
gate
ready
armed
for
battle
and
being
on
the
farther
side
he
said
are
you
he
that
has
done
all
this
wrong
to
the
noble
lady
belgé
exiling
her
from
her
own
land
in
such
fashion
that
all
the
world
cries
shame
on
you
the
tyrant
answered
i
stand
on
my
own
right
what
i
have
done
that
will
i
justify
so
saying
he
ran
furiously
at
the
prince
beating
upon
his
armour
with
a
great
as
if
he
would
have
chopped
it
in
pieces
so
fierce
was
his
onset
that
the
prince
was
constrained
to
give
place
awhile
so
heavy
were
his
strokes
one
had
thought
they
would
have
riven
a
rock
asunder
also
he
had
the
advantage
of
his
threefold
form
three
pairs
of
hands
he
had
and
he
could
shift
his
weapon
from
one
to
the
other
as
occasion
served
so
crafty
was
he
and
so
nimble
that
an
adversary
scarce
could
know
where
and
when
he
should
defend
himself
but
the
prince
was
his
match
and
more
ever
he
watched
the
motion
of
his
hands
and
parried
the
blow
wherever
it
might
fall
and
the
tyrant
being
thus
baffled
again
and
again
roared
for
very
rage
till
at
the
last
gathering
up
all
the
strength
of
the
three
bodies
into
one
stroke
he
thought
to
fell
his
adversary
to
the
ground
what
had
happened
had
the
stroke
come
upon
the
man
none
can
say
but
it
lighted
on
the
horse
and
brought
him
to
the
ground
so
now
the
prince
was
constrained
to
fight
on
foot
and
the
giant
laughed
aloud
to
think
that
he
had
him
at
a
disadvantage
but
the
fortune
of
the
fight
went
not
so
now
this
arm
and
now
that
did
the
prince
shear
away
with
his
good
sword
and
he
himself
was
sheltered
safe
under
his
shield
so
faultless
was
its
temper
that
no
blow
could
shatter
it
and
ever
the
giant
was
more
and
more
carried
away
by
his
rage
till
at
the
last
offering
his
whole
side
to
the
attack
of
the
prince
he
was
brought
to
the
ground
a
corpse
nay
three
corpses
for
all
were
smitten
to
death
by
the
one
stroke
and
lay
a
bloody
heap
upon
the
plain
all
this
while
the
lady
belgé
watched
the
fortunes
of
the
fight
from
the
city
wall
with
her
two
sons
standing
on
either
hand
and
when
she
saw
the
issue
she
hastened
to
greet
him
the
people
of
the
city
also
who
had
waited
to
see
to
whom
the
victory
should
fall
hastened
to
do
him
homage
right
glad
were
they
to
be
rid
of
the
giant
s
tyranny
when
the
lady
belgé
had
rendered
the
prince
her
thanks
which
he
received
with
due
tis
not
the
strength
nor
courage
of
the
doer
said
he
but
the
justice
of
his
deed
that
should
be
looked
to
said
o
noble
sir
you
have
freed
me
from
my
chief
foe
nevertheless
there
remains
yet
something
to
be
done
i
pray
you
not
to
stay
your
victorious
arms
till
you
have
rooted
out
all
that
remains
of
this
vile
brood
and
established
my
peace
for
tell
me
lady
he
answered
what
is
this
that
remains
sir
she
answered
in
this
temple
hard
by
there
is
as
you
have
heard
a
monstrous
idol
which
this
tyrant
set
up
and
to
which
he
offered
up
sacrifices
taking
alas
of
my
dear
children
and
many
children
also
of
this
people
now
in
a
cavern
underneath
this
idol
there
lies
a
most
hideous
monster
which
is
wont
to
feed
upon
the
flesh
of
these
sacrifices
no
man
they
say
has
ever
looked
upon
its
shape
so
fearful
is
it
and
when
the
prince
heard
this
he
was
occupied
with
a
great
desire
to
deal
with
this
same
monster
and
demanded
that
the
queen
should
show
him
the
place
where
it
abode
it
is
beneath
the
altar
said
she
and
he
uncovered
his
shield
for
the
need
was
such
as
to
demand
the
help
the
idol
he
saw
but
not
the
monster
then
he
took
his
sword
and
with
the
naked
blade
he
struck
three
times
as
if
in
defiance
and
at
the
third
time
the
monster
came
from
out
its
hideous
it
was
to
see
huge
of
size
as
long
it
seemed
as
the
whole
chapel
with
the
face
of
a
woman
and
the
body
of
a
dog
its
claws
were
like
to
lion
s
claws
it
had
a
tail
with
a
deadly
sting
and
eagle
s
wings
nevertheless
for
all
its
strength
it
was
dismayed
to
see
the
knight
and
especially
the
burning
brightness
of
his
shield
it
would
have
fled
again
to
its
but
that
the
prince
would
not
suffer
seeing
then
that
it
had
to
fight
the
monster
flew
at
the
prince
s
shield
and
caught
it
with
its
claws
purposing
either
to
break
it
or
if
that
might
not
be
to
wrench
it
out
of
his
hands
long
did
they
struggle
together
but
at
the
last
the
prince
with
a
stroke
of
his
sword
shore
off
the
monster
s
claws
exceeding
loud
was
the
bellowing
which
it
made
seeming
to
make
the
whole
chapel
rock
to
its
foundations
next
it
struck
at
the
prince
with
its
great
tail
and
brought
him
to
the
ground
but
before
it
could
strike
a
second
blow
he
had
severed
the
last
joint
with
his
sword
last
of
all
it
raised
itself
on
its
great
wings
and
flew
at
his
head
doubtless
it
had
hurt
him
sore
but
that
he
held
his
shield
between
while
he
so
warded
off
the
attack
he
struck
full
at
the
monster
s
belly
and
so
did
it
to
death
great
was
the
rejoicing
in
the
city
when
the
people
knew
that
the
creature
which
had
oppressed
them
so
long
was
slain
they
crowned
the
prince
with
bays
and
led
him
through
the
streets
with
solemn
pomp
after
this
he
tarried
awhile
in
the
city
establishing
queen
belgé
on
her
throne
and
setting
all
things
in
due
order
till
the
time
came
when
he
had
to
depart
for
the
completing
of
his
task
chapter
xxxiv
of
sir
artegall
and
grantorto
while
these
things
were
doing
sir
artegall
set
forth
to
accomplish
his
task
having
talus
with
him
as
before
after
he
had
journeyed
awhile
he
overtook
an
old
man
who
was
travelling
alone
and
perceived
that
he
was
the
same
that
had
attended
the
lady
irene
when
she
came
to
the
court
of
queen
gloriana
he
had
been
a
famous
knight
in
his
day
but
had
long
since
foregone
the
use
of
arms
being
stricken
with
age
hail
sir
sergis
he
cried
there
lives
no
truer
knight
i
know
but
tell
me
what
is
your
errand
how
fares
the
lady
irene
how
comes
it
that
you
have
left
her
is
she
in
prison
does
she
yet
live
she
lives
answered
the
old
knight
but
she
is
in
sore
trouble
trusting
to
your
promise
that
you
would
come
to
be
her
champion
and
do
battle
with
him
who
was
oppressing
her
she
came
at
the
appointed
time
but
found
you
not
and
now
grantorto
has
thrown
her
into
prison
and
has
appointed
her
a
day
saying
that
if
by
that
time
no
champion
shall
appear
to
justify
her
and
prove
her
clear
of
the
crimes
of
which
she
is
accused
she
shall
suffer
sir
artegall
was
sorely
troubled
to
hear
these
words
knowing
that
she
suffered
these
things
through
his
default
verily
he
said
i
am
to
blame
for
this
fair
maiden
s
trouble
in
that
i
was
not
present
to
maintain
her
cause
but
as
you
know
i
was
not
wholly
to
blame
for
that
which
hindered
me
but
tell
me
how
many
days
has
the
tyrant
allowed
for
the
finding
of
this
champion
ten
days
he
has
given
answered
the
old
knight
but
he
knows
that
tis
only
a
form
for
he
guards
all
the
coasts
and
approaches
by
which
such
a
champion
might
come
indeed
he
counts
her
to
be
already
turn
again
dear
knight
said
sir
artegall
surely
if
i
live
she
shall
have
the
champion
whom
she
needs
within
the
appointed
time
so
they
two
went
on
together
as
they
rode
they
were
aware
of
a
great
rout
of
people
who
seemed
to
be
looking
on
at
some
affray
coming
nearer
they
perceived
a
number
of
rude
fellows
setting
on
a
single
knight
and
chasing
him
to
and
fro
as
if
they
would
make
him
prisoner
and
he
on
the
other
hand
sought
to
make
his
way
to
a
lady
who
might
be
seen
in
another
part
of
the
field
holding
up
her
hands
and
praying
for
help
wheresoever
he
turned
they
gave
way
before
him
yet
ever
returned
and
renewed
their
attack
and
so
great
were
their
numbers
pressed
him
sorely
so
harassed
was
he
with
their
assailing
that
he
threw
away
his
shield
a
most
dishonourable
thing
for
any
knight
to
do
and
one
that
marks
him
with
shame
without
end
when
sir
artegall
saw
in
what
an
evil
plight
the
man
stood
he
rode
forward
to
his
help
yet
he
was
himself
so
rudely
assailed
that
he
was
constrained
to
give
place
for
a
while
but
when
talus
began
to
use
his
iron
flail
then
the
multitude
fled
for
their
lives
being
scattered
as
the
wind
scatters
the
chaff
on
a
when
the
knight
had
given
thanks
for
his
deliverance
sir
artegall
said
to
him
what
is
the
occasion
of
this
uproar
who
are
you
and
who
are
these
villains
that
attacked
you
so
furiously
the
knight
answered
my
name
is
burbon
i
have
won
honour
as
a
knight
and
have
been
in
good
repute
till
of
late
trouble
has
overtaken
me
this
lady
is
by
name
fleur
de
lys
my
love
she
is
though
of
late
she
has
scorned
me
i
know
not
whether
by
her
own
choice
or
by
constraint
of
others
it
can
not
be
denied
that
she
was
once
betrothed
to
me
of
her
own
free
choice
but
a
certain
tyrant
whom
men
call
grantorto
won
her
by
gifts
and
lying
words
this
host
of
villains
he
sent
to
take
her
away
from
me
by
open
then
said
sir
artegall
i
see
sir
knight
that
you
have
suffered
grievous
things
yet
not
without
fault
of
your
own
but
let
us
first
rid
you
of
these
villains
that
done
we
can
make
a
settlement
of
other
this
then
they
did
talus
greatly
helping
with
his
flail
but
when
they
came
to
the
lady
who
had
been
left
by
them
who
had
taken
her
prisoner
they
were
in
no
little
doubt
in
what
mind
she
was
for
she
seemed
to
be
neither
glad
nor
sorry
one
thing
was
certain
to
wit
that
she
was
wondrous
fair
and
clad
in
splendid
robes
when
sir
burbon
lighting
from
his
horse
ran
to
her
and
would
have
clasped
her
in
his
arms
she
turned
from
him
in
high
disdain
begone
she
cried
and
touch
me
then
said
sir
artegall
fair
lady
you
cast
a
very
great
blemish
on
your
beauty
if
you
change
a
plighted
faith
is
there
aught
on
earth
so
dear
and
so
precious
as
faith
and
honour
love
surely
is
dearer
than
life
and
fame
is
more
to
be
desired
than
gold
but
a
plighted
troth
is
more
to
be
honoured
than
even
love
or
at
this
rebuke
the
lady
seemed
much
abashed
and
sir
burbon
lifting
her
in
his
arms
set
her
on
her
steed
nor
did
she
repulse
him
so
they
rode
away
but
whether
wholly
agreed
or
not
no
one
can
say
these
matters
being
accomplished
sir
artegall
with
sir
sergis
pursued
his
journey
till
they
came
to
the
seashore
there
by
good
fortune
they
found
a
ship
ready
equipped
for
sailing
this
they
hired
that
it
should
take
them
whither
they
would
and
embarking
in
it
found
wind
and
weather
serve
them
so
well
that
in
a
single
day
they
came
to
the
land
which
they
sought
there
they
saw
drawn
up
on
the
shore
great
hosts
of
men
who
should
hinder
them
from
landing
but
they
did
not
for
this
forego
their
purpose
so
soon
as
they
approached
so
near
to
the
shore
that
they
could
see
the
bottom
beneath
the
waves
talus
leapt
from
the
ship
into
the
sea
the
enemy
sought
to
overwhelm
him
with
stones
and
darts
but
he
heeded
them
not
at
all
wading
through
the
waves
he
came
to
the
shore
and
once
having
put
his
foot
upon
the
land
chased
all
the
multitude
away
even
as
an
eagle
chases
a
flock
of
doves
the
way
being
thus
made
clear
for
there
was
now
no
one
to
hinder
them
sir
artegall
and
the
old
knight
landed
and
made
their
way
to
a
city
that
was
hard
by
the
tyrant
grantorto
being
made
aware
of
their
coming
by
some
of
those
that
had
fled
from
talus
gathered
a
host
of
men
and
came
against
them
but
these
also
did
talus
discomfit
with
his
flail
pursuing
them
till
artegall
himself
bade
him
hold
his
hand
for
he
would
settle
the
quarrel
in
more
orderly
fashion
therefore
he
called
a
herald
and
bade
him
take
a
message
to
king
grantorto
to
this
purport
i
came
not
hither
to
fight
against
your
people
but
to
maintain
the
cause
of
the
lady
irene
against
you
in
single
combat
do
you
therefore
call
your
people
back
that
they
may
suffer
no
further
damage
but
fix
a
time
and
place
for
us
two
to
fight
together
in
the
cause
of
the
lady
that
night
he
pitched
his
tent
outside
the
city
and
would
suffer
none
to
come
near
him
only
sir
sergis
kept
him
company
and
gave
such
services
as
were
needful
now
the
lady
irene
had
not
heard
of
the
coming
of
sir
artegall
and
this
being
the
day
on
which
lacking
a
champion
who
should
defend
her
cause
it
was
appointed
for
her
to
die
she
arrayed
herself
in
squalid
garments
fit
for
such
occasion
and
prepared
herself
for
her
doom
but
her
mood
was
changed
to
joy
when
coming
to
the
appointed
place
she
found
sir
artegall
ready
to
do
battle
for
her
and
now
the
lists
having
been
made
ready
grantorto
came
forth
prepared
for
battle
he
was
clad
in
armour
of
iron
with
a
steel
cap
rusty
brown
in
colour
on
his
head
and
in
his
hand
he
carried
a
huge
he
was
of
mighty
stature
standing
up
as
a
giant
among
other
men
and
hideous
of
aspect
very
expert
in
arms
was
he
and
of
great
strength
no
man
had
ever
stood
against
him
in
fight
and
held
his
own
then
the
trumpets
sounded
and
the
two
met
fast
and
furiously
did
grantorto
rain
his
blows
upon
his
adversary
this
was
his
manner
of
fighting
to
wit
to
overbear
his
foe
by
the
fierceness
of
his
attack
giving
him
no
respite
or
but
of
this
sir
artegall
was
well
aware
and
bore
himself
accordingly
it
was
as
when
a
sailor
sees
a
storm
approaching
and
strikes
his
sails
and
loosens
his
so
did
sir
artegall
stoop
his
head
shunning
the
great
shower
of
blows
small
shame
it
is
to
stoop
if
a
man
shall
thereafter
raise
his
head
the
higher
for
a
time
indeed
it
might
seem
that
the
tyrant
would
prevail
so
heavy
was
the
shower
of
blows
that
he
poured
upon
him
and
so
many
the
wounds
which
the
great
made
even
through
his
armour
but
ere
long
the
occasion
came
for
which
the
knight
had
waited
when
the
tyrant
raised
his
arm
high
to
strike
what
should
be
he
hoped
a
mortal
blow
sir
artegall
smote
under
his
guard
and
drove
his
sword
deep
into
his
flank
so
that
the
blood
gushed
forth
in
a
great
stream
meanwhile
the
blow
of
the
had
fallen
and
despite
the
shield
which
the
knight
had
raised
to
defend
his
head
had
bitten
so
deep
that
the
giant
could
by
no
means
loose
it
again
then
sir
artegall
let
go
his
shield
and
struck
grantorto
on
the
head
with
such
strength
that
he
brought
him
to
the
ground
and
as
he
lay
with
yet
another
stroke
severed
his
head
from
his
body
then
all
the
people
glad
to
be
rid
of
the
tyrant
joyfully
hastened
to
pay
their
homage
to
queen
irene
so
she
was
established
on
her
throne
sir
artegall
tarried
awhile
to
order
all
things
in
peace
and
justice
talus
helping
much
in
the
seeking
out
and
punishment
of
offenders
chapter
xxxv
of
sir
calidore
and
the
lady
briana
as
sir
artegall
was
returning
from
his
latest
enterprise
he
met
a
certain
sir
calidore
who
was
in
high
repute
among
the
knights
and
dames
of
fairyland
for
his
courtesy
and
honesty
these
two
had
been
friends
in
old
time
and
now
were
right
glad
to
meet
hail
noble
sir
said
sir
calidore
tell
me
i
pray
you
how
you
have
prospered
in
your
and
when
the
other
had
unfolded
the
whole
matter
in
order
what
hindrances
he
had
encountered
and
what
success
he
had
achieved
in
the
end
happy
man
he
said
that
have
accomplished
so
great
an
enterprise
you
are
at
the
end
of
your
labours
but
i
am
but
beginning
mine
nor
do
i
know
where
to
begin
the
way
is
all
untried
i
know
not
what
dangers
await
me
nor
what
provision
i
must
what
then
is
this
enterprise
of
yours
said
sir
artegall
i
pursue
answered
the
other
the
blatant
beast
a
monster
that
having
been
nurtured
in
the
regions
below
has
now
come
forth
on
the
earth
to
be
the
plague
and
bane
of
men
my
task
is
to
follow
him
if
need
be
all
over
the
world
till
i
can
destroy
such
a
creature
i
myself
saw
said
sir
artegall
after
that
i
left
the
savage
island
it
seemed
to
have
full
a
thousand
tongues
and
with
all
of
these
it
bayed
and
barked
at
me
i
heeded
him
not
and
this
seemed
to
move
him
to
still
greater
doubtless
answered
sir
calidore
that
is
the
monster
which
i
go
on
and
prosper
said
sir
artegall
and
so
they
parted
in
all
friendship
and
amity
after
sir
calidore
had
travelled
a
mile
or
so
he
came
upon
a
squire
a
comely
youth
to
behold
whom
his
enemies
had
bound
to
a
tree
the
same
loudly
called
on
him
for
help
which
he
without
waiting
to
ask
questions
promptly
rendered
when
he
had
loosed
his
bonds
he
said
tell
me
unhappy
man
how
you
came
into
this
evil
plight
who
was
it
that
captured
you
and
bound
you
in
this
fashion
sir
knight
said
the
man
be
assured
that
it
was
by
misfortune
only
not
by
fault
committed
that
i
came
into
this
condition
not
far
from
this
place
there
is
a
very
strong
castle
where
they
keep
this
evil
custom
no
man
may
pass
along
the
the
road
so
lies
that
none
may
pass
without
leave
obtained
from
them
who
hold
the
payment
of
toll
and
the
toll
is
every
lady
her
hair
and
from
every
knight
his
as
shameful
a
custom
as
ever
came
to
my
ears
cried
sir
calidore
and
one
speedily
to
be
overthrown
but
tell
me
how
it
came
about
and
what
was
its
beginning
in
this
castle
the
squire
made
reply
there
dwells
a
certain
lady
briana
by
name
there
is
no
one
on
earth
more
proud
and
it
vexes
her
sorely
that
she
loves
a
certain
sir
crudor
and
that
he
will
not
deign
to
return
love
for
love
until
she
shall
make
for
him
a
mantle
lined
with
the
hair
of
ladies
and
the
beards
of
knights
and
she
to
gain
this
end
uses
the
castle
having
for
her
minister
in
the
matter
a
certain
maleffort
who
indeed
does
her
will
in
the
most
cruel
fashion
this
very
day
as
i
journeyed
by
the
road
with
the
lady
whom
i
love
this
maleffort
made
an
assault
upon
us
me
first
he
took
prisoner
for
i
could
not
withstand
him
so
strong
was
he
this
done
he
pursued
the
damsel
binding
me
to
this
tree
until
he
should
come
back
but
whether
he
has
found
her
or
not
i
know
while
he
was
yet
speaking
they
heard
a
loud
shriek
from
hard
by
and
looking
to
the
place
saw
the
knave
holding
a
lady
by
her
garments
and
about
to
shear
the
tresses
from
her
head
when
sir
calidore
saw
this
he
was
greatly
moved
with
wrath
the
squire
he
left
and
turned
to
pursue
the
villain
hold
he
cried
leave
that
evil
doing
and
turn
to
answer
me
the
fellow
trusting
in
his
strength
which
indeed
had
never
failed
him
answered
him
scornfully
who
said
he
are
you
that
defy
me
in
this
fashion
you
take
this
maiden
s
part
will
you
then
give
your
beard
though
it
be
but
little
for
her
locks
nay
nay
you
may
not
purchase
them
so
so
saying
he
ran
at
sir
calidore
in
a
mighty
rage
and
rained
upon
him
a
great
shower
of
blows
the
knight
who
was
well
skilled
in
arms
held
back
awhile
standing
on
his
defence
and
let
him
spend
his
strength
but
when
he
perceived
that
he
was
failing
somewhat
then
he
began
to
press
him
the
more
he
gave
way
the
more
strongly
he
assailed
him
at
last
the
fellow
lost
heart
and
turned
to
fly
hoping
to
gain
the
castle
and
find
shelter
so
he
fled
sir
calidore
pursuing
and
now
he
had
reached
the
gate
and
cried
aloud
that
they
should
open
to
him
without
delay
this
indeed
they
who
were
within
seeing
in
what
extremity
he
was
made
haste
to
do
but
even
as
he
stood
in
the
porch
sir
calidore
dealt
him
a
mighty
blow
with
his
sword
and
cleft
his
head
from
the
crown
to
the
chin
he
fell
down
dead
where
he
stood
and
when
they
would
have
shut
the
gate
they
could
not
for
the
carcase
blocked
the
way
and
sir
calidore
entering
in
slew
the
porter
where
he
stood
then
all
who
were
in
the
castle
set
at
him
but
in
vain
he
swept
them
aside
full
easily
as
an
ox
standing
in
a
meadow
on
a
summer
day
sweeps
away
the
flies
which
trouble
him
so
he
passed
from
the
porch
into
the
hall
where
the
lady
briana
met
him
and
assailed
him
with
angry
words
calling
him
villain
because
he
had
slain
her
steward
and
was
now
come
to
rob
her
of
her
possessions
nay
nay
fair
lady
he
made
answer
i
deserve
not
these
reproaches
i
came
to
abate
an
evil
custom
that
you
wot
of
such
things
do
dishonour
to
the
laws
of
courtesy
i
pray
you
therefore
of
your
own
accord
to
do
away
with
this
evil
rather
show
kindness
and
hospitality
to
all
such
as
pass
by
this
way
so
shall
you
gain
a
glory
that
is
better
far
than
earthly
these
words
did
but
make
her
wrath
more
strong
know
sir
she
cried
that
i
disdain
all
this
talk
of
kindness
and
courtesy
and
defy
you
to
the
i
hold
it
no
shame
answered
sir
calidore
to
take
defiance
from
a
lady
but
were
there
one
here
who
would
abide
the
trial
with
his
sword
gladly
would
i
prove
my
words
upon
then
the
lady
in
great
haste
called
to
her
a
dwarf
who
served
her
and
taking
from
her
hand
a
ring
of
gold
gave
it
to
him
saying
take
this
with
all
speed
to
sir
crudor
and
tell
him
that
there
is
a
knight
here
who
has
slain
my
steward
and
done
much
damage
to
my
people
for
it
had
been
agreed
between
them
that
when
urgent
need
should
arise
she
should
send
this
ring
so
the
dwarf
departed
with
the
ring
and
travelled
all
that
night
meanwhile
sir
calidore
abode
in
the
castle
the
lady
being
now
scornful
now
angry
and
he
enduring
her
moods
with
all
patience
and
courtesy
the
next
day
before
the
sun
rose
came
the
dwarf
bringing
a
message
from
sir
crudor
that
he
would
come
to
her
help
before
he
had
broken
his
fast
and
would
deliver
to
her
the
enemy
alive
or
dead
and
he
sent
his
helmet
as
a
true
token
greatly
did
the
lady
briana
rejoice
to
have
such
news
and
behaved
herself
more
scornfully
than
ever
to
sir
calidore
he
took
no
heed
of
her
ways
rather
rejoicing
that
he
should
have
someone
with
whom
to
settle
this
quarrel
so
he
donned
his
arms
and
waited
for
the
coming
of
sir
crudor
nor
did
he
wait
long
right
soon
did
he
espy
a
knight
riding
across
the
plain
this
said
he
to
himself
is
the
lady
briana
s
champion
and
without
staying
to
ask
of
anyone
who
this
might
be
he
rode
forth
to
meet
him
the
two
came
together
in
the
middle
of
the
plain
with
so
strong
a
shock
that
both
were
rolled
upon
the
ground
each
rider
with
his
horse
sir
calidore
rose
lightly
from
the
ground
while
his
adversary
still
lay
without
sense
or
speech
but
he
disdained
to
do
him
any
damage
it
would
ill
become
a
courteous
knight
to
strike
a
sleeping
foe
but
briana
where
she
stood
upon
the
castle
walls
thought
that
her
champion
was
dead
and
loudly
bemoaned
him
and
made
as
if
she
would
throw
herself
from
the
walls
to
the
earth
after
a
while
sir
crudor
raised
himself
from
the
ground
but
in
listless
fashion
like
to
one
who
can
scarcely
rouse
himself
from
sleep
but
when
he
saw
his
adversary
his
spirit
returned
to
him
as
before
and
he
renewed
the
fight
hoping
that
he
would
fare
better
on
foot
than
he
had
fared
on
horseback
long
did
they
fight
dealing
each
to
other
fearful
blows
not
once
so
fierce
were
they
did
they
pause
to
take
rest
at
the
last
when
as
if
by
common
consent
both
lifted
their
swords
high
in
the
air
to
deal
what
might
be
a
final
blow
and
so
finish
the
fight
either
for
this
champion
or
for
that
sir
calidore
being
more
nimble
and
quicker
of
sight
than
his
adversary
was
beforehand
with
him
and
struck
him
with
so
sharp
a
blow
upon
his
helmet
that
he
brought
him
to
his
knee
nor
did
he
fail
to
follow
up
his
advantage
but
redoubling
the
fierceness
of
his
strokes
brought
him
altogether
to
the
ground
as
he
lay
there
he
would
have
unlaced
his
helmet
and
given
him
his
but
the
vanquished
man
begged
for
mercy
then
sir
calidore
mastering
his
anger
such
was
his
courtesy
said
mercy
i
grant
with
all
goodwill
do
you
learn
not
to
treat
strangers
with
such
rudeness
this
ill
befits
a
knight
for
his
first
duty
is
to
conquer
himself
and
now
i
give
you
your
life
on
these
conditions
that
you
help
to
the
best
of
your
power
all
wandering
knights
and
also
give
aid
as
you
can
to
all
ladies
in
these
things
the
knight
being
thus
delivered
beyond
all
hope
from
the
fear
of
death
promised
to
do
and
swore
fealty
to
sir
calidore
as
being
his
liege
lord
for
all
his
life
all
this
time
the
lady
briana
was
looking
in
great
dismay
and
trouble
of
mind
and
now
sir
calidore
bidding
her
to
approach
told
all
that
had
been
agreed
between
him
and
sir
crudor
she
was
overcome
by
so
great
a
courtesy
and
thanked
him
with
all
her
heart
for
indeed
it
was
in
her
inmost
heart
that
she
was
moved
she
threw
herself
at
his
feet
and
declared
herself
to
be
wholly
bound
to
him
after
this
they
all
betook
themselves
to
the
castle
where
the
lady
entertained
them
in
most
joyous
fashion
the
banquet
ended
she
said
sir
calidore
i
do
bestow
this
castle
upon
you
freely
and
without
price
by
way
of
token
of
how
great
is
my
debt
to
then
answered
sir
calidore
lady
i
thank
you
for
this
gift
but
i
am
not
minded
to
take
any
hire
or
reward
for
any
good
deed
that
it
may
be
given
me
to
so
he
gave
the
castle
to
the
squire
that
he
and
the
damsel
might
dwell
there
and
when
he
had
tarried
there
certain
days
and
was
now
made
whole
of
his
wounds
he
went
forth
again
on
his
quest
chapter
xxxvi
of
the
valour
of
tristram
as
sir
calidore
went
on
his
way
he
saw
a
young
man
of
great
stature
fighting
on
foot
with
a
knight
on
horseback
not
far
from
these
two
stood
a
lady
clad
in
very
poor
array
sir
calidore
would
have
inquired
of
her
the
cause
of
the
strife
having
it
in
his
mind
to
part
the
two
combatants
if
this
might
be
done
but
before
he
could
come
at
the
place
the
youth
had
slain
the
knight
a
thing
at
which
he
wondered
not
a
little
this
same
youth
was
very
goodly
to
look
at
slender
in
shape
and
of
but
seventeen
years
or
so
as
it
seemed
but
tall
and
fair
of
face
he
was
clad
in
a
woodman
s
jacket
of
lincoln
green
embroidered
with
silver
with
a
huntsman
s
horn
hanging
by
his
side
he
had
a
dart
in
his
right
hand
and
in
his
left
a
what
means
this
said
sir
calidore
you
who
are
no
knight
have
slain
a
knight
a
thing
plainly
contrary
to
the
law
of
i
would
not
wish
answered
the
youth
to
break
the
law
of
arms
yet
would
i
break
it
again
sooner
than
suffer
such
wrong
as
i
have
of
this
man
so
long
as
i
have
two
hands
wherewith
to
defend
myself
the
quarrel
with
him
was
not
of
my
seeking
as
this
lady
can
tell
me
therefore
said
sir
calidore
how
things
fell
sir
knight
answered
the
lad
i
was
hunting
in
the
wood
as
i
am
wont
to
do
for
lack
of
graver
employment
for
which
my
years
are
not
fit
when
i
saw
this
knight
who
lies
dead
yonder
passing
over
the
plain
with
this
lady
in
his
company
he
was
on
horseback
but
she
followed
on
foot
and
when
she
lagged
behind
as
she
must
needs
do
so
rough
was
the
ground
then
he
smote
her
with
the
butt
of
his
spear
taking
no
heed
of
her
tears
and
prayers
this
sight
i
saw
with
no
small
indignation
and
being
moved
with
wrath
said
surely
sir
knight
you
should
rather
takeup
this
lady
to
ride
behind
you
than
make
her
travel
so
to
this
he
answered
in
angry
words
bidding
me
hold
my
peace
nor
meddle
with
things
that
concerned
me
not
or
said
he
i
will
whip
you
as
a
malapert
boy
should
be
whipped
so
after
some
angry
talk
he
struck
me
twice
with
his
spear
and
i
threw
at
him
a
dart
fellow
of
this
which
you
see
here
in
my
hand
nor
did
i
throw
it
in
vain
for
it
struck
him
beneath
the
heart
so
hard
that
presently
he
sir
calidore
was
not
a
little
pleased
with
his
manner
of
speech
so
bold
and
honest
was
it
and
he
admired
also
the
sturdiness
of
the
stroke
which
had
broken
to
such
effect
the
coat
of
mail
and
when
after
question
put
to
the
lady
he
found
that
it
was
even
as
the
lad
had
told
he
said
i
do
not
condemn
this
youth
but
rather
hold
him
free
of
blame
tis
the
duty
of
knights
and
indeed
of
all
men
to
bear
themselves
kindly
and
courteously
to
women
and
he
did
well
to
maintain
this
good
custom
but
now
i
would
have
you
tell
me
lady
if
you
will
how
it
came
about
that
the
man
whom
he
slew
treated
you
in
so
unseemly
a
fashion
sir
knight
answered
the
lady
i
am
loath
to
bring
accusations
against
the
dead
yet
i
must
needs
declare
the
truth
this
day
as
this
knight
and
i
were
passing
on
our
way
we
came
upon
a
glade
in
the
wood
where
there
sat
two
lovers
a
comely
knight
and
a
fair
lady
the
knight
my
companion
being
taken
with
the
lady
s
beauty
bade
me
dismount
and
when
i
was
unwilling
to
do
so
thrust
me
out
of
my
seat
with
violence
which
when
he
had
done
he
said
to
the
other
now
yield
me
up
that
dame
and
when
the
indeed
he
was
not
prepared
for
then
he
wounded
him
sorely
with
his
spear
this
he
did
though
the
other
had
proffered
to
do
battle
with
him
if
only
he
would
appoint
a
day
when
they
might
try
their
strength
on
equal
terms
meanwhile
the
lady
had
fled
into
the
wood
and
had
hidden
herself
to
such
good
purpose
that
when
my
knight
sought
to
find
her
he
spent
all
his
labour
in
vain
at
this
baulk
he
was
greatly
enraged
he
would
not
set
me
on
his
horse
again
but
constrained
me
to
follow
on
foot
smiting
me
with
his
spear
if
ever
i
lagged
behind
and
taking
no
heed
of
my
tears
and
complaining
so
we
went
on
till
we
fell
in
with
this
young
man
and
he
being
moved
with
pity
at
my
evil
plight
rebuked
the
knight
how
the
matter
ended
you
have
seen
for
this
boor
has
received
his
due
said
calidore
then
turning
to
the
lad
he
said
tell
me
now
who
you
are
and
how
you
came
to
be
in
this
place
never
did
i
see
greater
promise
in
anyone
and
i
would
help
you
to
bring
it
to
as
good
fulfilment
as
may
sir
knight
the
youth
made
answer
it
may
be
that
the
revealing
of
my
name
and
lineage
may
be
to
my
hurt
for
of
such
danger
i
have
been
warned
nevertheless
so
courteously
have
you
borne
yourself
to
me
that
i
will
tell
you
the
whole
truth
i
am
a
briton
tristram
by
name
son
of
good
king
meliogras
who
once
reigned
in
the
land
of
cornwall
he
dying
while
i
was
yet
of
tender
years
his
brother
took
the
kingdom
thereupon
my
mother
queen
emiline
conceiving
me
to
be
in
danger
from
this
same
uncle
thought
it
best
to
send
me
into
some
foreign
land
where
i
should
not
be
within
his
reach
if
the
thought
of
doing
me
a
mischief
should
arise
in
his
heart
so
according
to
the
counsel
of
a
wise
man
of
whom
she
inquired
in
her
perplexity
she
sent
me
from
the
land
of
lyonesse
where
i
was
born
to
the
land
of
fairy
where
no
one
knowing
who
or
what
i
was
none
would
seek
to
do
me
wrong
i
was
then
ten
years
of
age
and
i
have
abode
in
this
land
ever
since
not
wasting
my
days
in
vain
delights
but
perfecting
myself
in
all
the
arts
of
hunting
but
now
it
is
time
i
hold
to
look
to
higher
things
therefore
this
being
such
an
occasion
as
might
not
again
befall
i
would
entreat
of
you
that
you
advance
me
unworthy
though
i
be
to
a
squire
s
degree
so
that
i
may
duly
learn
and
practise
all
the
use
of
arms
and
for
this
i
have
this
beginning
to
wit
the
arms
of
this
knight
whom
i
slew
in
fair
sir
calidore
answered
fair
child
i
would
not
by
any
means
baulk
this
your
honourable
desire
to
follow
the
profession
of
arms
only
i
could
wish
that
i
could
set
you
to
some
service
that
should
be
worthy
of
you
kneel
therefore
and
swear
that
you
will
be
faithful
to
any
knight
whom
you
shall
serve
as
squire
and
be
true
to
all
ladies
and
never
draw
back
from
fear
of
any
deed
that
it
may
be
fitting
for
you
to
so
tristram
knelt
down
upon
his
knees
and
took
his
oath
to
do
according
to
these
words
thereupon
sir
calidore
dubbed
him
a
squire
and
he
bloomed
forth
straightway
in
all
joy
and
gladness
even
as
a
bud
opens
into
a
flower
but
when
tristram
besought
him
that
he
might
go
with
him
on
his
present
adventure
vowing
that
he
would
follow
him
to
the
death
sir
calidore
answered
i
should
be
right
glad
most
courteous
squire
to
have
you
with
me
so
that
i
might
see
the
valour
which
you
have
show
itself
in
honourable
achievement
but
this
may
not
be
i
am
bound
by
vow
to
my
sovereign
who
set
me
this
task
to
accomplish
that
i
would
not
take
anyone
to
aid
me
for
this
reason
i
may
not
grant
your
request
but
now
seeing
that
this
lady
is
left
desolate
and
is
in
need
of
safe
convoy
you
will
do
well
to
succour
her
in
this
her
this
service
the
youth
gladly
undertook
and
sir
calidore
taking
leave
of
him
and
the
dame
in
courteous
fashion
set
forth
again
on
his
quest
he
had
not
travelled
far
before
he
came
to
the
place
where
the
knight
who
had
been
so
discourteously
treated
by
him
whom
tristram
had
slain
lay
in
a
most
sorrowful
plight
he
was
bleeding
from
many
wounds
so
that
all
the
earth
about
him
was
red
and
the
lady
sat
by
him
weeping
and
yet
doing
all
that
she
could
with
careful
hands
to
dress
his
wounds
and
ease
his
pain
sir
calidore
when
he
saw
this
sorry
sight
was
moved
to
tears
from
which
scarce
refraining
himself
he
said
tell
me
sad
lady
if
your
grief
will
suffer
you
who
it
was
that
with
cruel
hand
wrought
such
mischief
to
a
knight
unarmed
for
surely
if
i
may
but
come
near
him
i
will
avenge
this
wrong
upon
the
lady
answered
fair
sir
this
knight
whom
you
see
here
and
i
sat
talking
in
lover
s
fashion
and
this
man
charged
him
unarmed
as
he
was
and
dealt
him
these
deadly
wounds
and
if
you
would
know
what
manner
of
man
he
was
he
was
of
tall
stature
clad
in
gilded
armour
crossed
with
a
band
of
blue
and
for
device
on
his
shield
he
had
a
lady
rowed
in
a
summer
barge
across
rough
when
sir
calidore
heard
this
he
was
assured
that
this
indeed
was
the
knight
whom
tristram
had
slain
and
he
said
lady
take
to
yourself
this
comfort
that
he
who
so
foully
wronged
your
knight
lies
now
in
yet
more
evil
case
i
saw
him
with
my
own
eyes
lying
dead
upon
the
earth
a
just
recompense
for
the
foul
wrong
that
he
did
to
your
fair
knight
and
now
bethink
you
what
we
may
best
do
for
this
wounded
man
how
you
may
best
convey
him
hence
and
to
what
she
thanked
him
for
his
courtesy
and
friendly
care
yet
knew
not
what
to
say
for
being
a
stranger
in
that
country
she
could
not
think
of
a
fitting
place
nor
could
she
ask
him
to
carry
the
wounded
man
this
he
did
not
fail
to
perceive
and
said
fair
lady
think
not
that
i
deem
it
a
disgrace
to
carry
this
burden
gladly
will
i
help
taking
therefore
his
shield
and
first
pouring
the
healing
balm
which
he
always
carried
with
him
for
such
needs
into
the
knight
s
wounds
he
put
him
thereon
and
bare
him
the
lady
helping
to
a
castle
that
was
hard
by
and
it
so
chanced
that
the
lord
of
this
castle
was
father
to
the
wounded
knight
a
man
far
advanced
in
years
who
had
been
a
famous
in
the
days
gone
by
and
was
of
most
courteous
and
hospitable
temper
aldus
was
his
name
and
his
son
s
name
was
aladine
great
was
his
grief
when
he
saw
his
dear
son
brought
home
in
such
a
plight
dear
boy
he
cried
and
is
the
pleasure
with
which
i
thought
to
welcome
you
to
this
your
home
turned
to
such
sorrow
nevertheless
he
put
a
brave
constraint
upon
his
sorrow
and
turned
himself
to
entertain
his
guests
with
all
hospitality
to
this
welcome
sir
calidore
made
a
courteous
return
but
the
lady
whose
name
was
priscilla
could
not
by
any
means
be
cheered
she
was
daughter
to
a
noble
lord
that
dwelt
hard
by
and
had
seen
and
loved
this
same
aladine
though
he
was
of
meaner
birth
and
smaller
estate
and
now
she
was
much
troubled
thinking
both
of
her
lover
s
perilous
state
and
of
how
her
father
would
take
the
matter
so
while
sir
aldus
entertained
sir
calidore
she
sat
and
tended
the
wounded
man
and
at
the
last
with
infinite
pains
brought
him
out
of
the
swoon
in
which
he
lay
and
restored
him
to
himself
the
next
day
when
sir
calidore
came
to
see
how
the
wounded
man
was
faring
he
found
him
not
a
little
bettered
in
state
of
body
but
anxious
in
mind
especially
for
his
lady
s
sake
because
of
the
displeasure
which
her
father
might
have
concerning
her
love
for
him
thereupon
he
told
to
sir
calidore
the
whole
story
of
his
love
and
besought
his
help
which
he
much
moved
by
pity
for
their
sorrowful
case
gladly
promised
that
he
would
give
this
promise
he
most
fully
did
perform
first
he
went
to
where
the
carcase
of
that
misbehaved
knight
lay
upon
the
ground
and
shore
the
head
from
the
body
this
he
took
in
his
hand
and
brought
the
lady
to
her
father
s
house
he
indeed
was
greatly
troubled
to
think
what
had
befallen
his
child
and
was
much
rejoiced
to
see
her
again
safe
and
sound
then
said
sir
calidore
your
daughter
was
like
to
suffer
wrong
from
an
evil
knight
but
he
suffered
for
his
evil
here
you
see
his
then
did
the
noble
lord
most
gladly
receive
her
again
to
her
home
and
sir
calidore
after
a
short
sojourn
departed
again
upon
his
quest
chapter
xxxvii
sir
calepine
and
the
lady
serena
as
sir
calidore
passed
on
his
way
he
came
upon
two
lovers
sir
calepine
and
the
lady
serena
as
they
sat
talking
together
they
were
abashed
to
see
him
and
he
being
the
very
soul
of
courtesy
made
most
humble
apology
for
so
disturbing
them
then
said
sir
calepine
sit
down
and
rest
awhile
and
let
us
talk
together
to
which
sir
calidore
courteously
assented
while
they
talked
the
lady
serena
tempted
by
the
fairness
of
the
place
and
seeking
to
make
a
garland
of
flowers
of
which
there
was
great
store
wandered
away
thereupon
the
blatant
beast
the
same
monster
which
sir
calidore
had
it
in
charge
to
seek
rushed
out
of
a
wood
that
was
hard
by
caught
her
in
his
mouth
and
carried
her
away
she
cried
aloud
to
the
two
knights
for
help
and
they
hearing
her
voice
started
up
to
succour
her
sir
calidore
being
the
more
swift
of
foot
of
the
two
overtook
the
beast
before
it
had
gone
far
thereupon
it
cast
down
the
lady
out
of
its
mouth
and
fled
nor
did
sir
calidore
delay
to
pursue
the
beast
the
lady
said
he
to
himself
will
be
cared
for
by
her
own
knight
but
as
for
me
i
must
not
abandon
my
how
he
fared
in
the
pursuit
will
be
told
hereafter
but
we
will
follow
in
the
meanwhile
the
fortunes
of
the
two
lovers
sir
calepine
found
the
lady
in
very
sad
plight
being
sorely
wounded
on
both
sides
by
the
monster
s
teeth
so
that
she
lay
upon
the
ground
in
a
swoon
as
if
she
were
dead
with
much
ado
he
brought
her
back
to
life
and
setting
her
on
his
horse
held
her
up
with
his
arms
till
they
could
find
some
place
where
she
might
rest
and
be
healed
of
her
wounds
so
they
journeyed
till
they
came
to
a
river
on
the
other
side
of
which
stood
a
fair
castle
in
which
he
hoped
that
he
might
find
shelter
but
when
he
came
to
the
water
s
edge
he
found
that
the
stream
could
scarce
be
forded
on
foot
while
he
doubted
what
it
were
best
to
do
there
came
a
knight
to
the
river
s
side
with
a
lady
riding
on
a
palfrey
by
his
side
thereupon
sir
calepine
with
all
due
courtesy
made
a
request
of
the
that
he
would
take
this
wounded
lady
to
the
other
side
not
so
replied
the
other
if
you
have
no
horse
of
your
own
you
shall
have
no
help
of
mine
go
on
foot
and
let
this
lady
do
the
same
or
if
you
like
it
better
carry
her
on
your
back
and
so
prove
yourself
a
the
lady
on
the
palfrey
was
much
displeased
at
the
rudeness
of
this
speech
and
pitying
the
plight
of
serena
would
have
helped
her
with
her
own
palfrey
for
this
courtesy
sir
calepine
thanked
her
but
being
very
angry
with
the
knight
would
have
none
of
her
help
stepping
down
therefore
into
the
river
he
held
himself
up
against
the
stream
with
his
spear
in
one
hand
and
with
the
other
hand
stayed
the
lady
on
his
horse
all
the
while
the
discourteous
knight
stood
on
the
bank
jeering
and
laughing
when
sir
calepine
had
won
in
safety
to
the
farther
bank
he
called
aloud
to
the
other
saying
unknightly
man
disgrace
to
all
who
bear
arms
i
defy
you
fight
if
you
dare
or
never
be
bold
to
bear
arms
but
the
fellow
took
no
heed
of
this
challenge
but
laughed
aloud
as
if
to
say
that
his
adversary
was
of
so
mean
estate
that
a
man
of
honour
need
not
trouble
to
regard
his
words
so
crossing
the
stream
he
came
to
the
fair
house
on
the
farther
bank
for
indeed
this
was
his
house
to
this
same
house
came
sir
calepine
for
indeed
there
was
no
other
house
where
he
could
find
shelter
and
asked
admittance
for
the
lady
s
sake
but
the
porter
said
we
find
no
lodging
here
for
any
wandering
knight
unless
he
is
willing
first
to
fight
with
the
master
of
the
and
who
is
he
said
sir
calepine
his
name
answered
the
porter
is
sir
turpin
a
mighty
man
and
a
great
fighter
he
bears
a
great
grudge
against
all
wandering
knights
by
reason
of
some
wrong
that
was
done
him
by
such
a
knight
in
time
then
said
sir
calepine
go
your
way
to
your
master
and
tell
him
that
a
wandering
knight
craves
shelter
for
a
wounded
lady
and
that
he
is
willing
to
fight
but
craves
that
sir
turpin
will
of
his
courtesy
postpone
this
issue
till
the
day
to
this
request
no
answer
other
than
had
first
been
delivered
was
made
and
sir
calepine
perforce
turned
away
not
knowing
what
else
he
could
do
all
that
night
he
sheltered
the
lady
under
a
bush
as
best
he
could
the
next
day
he
went
on
his
way
hoping
to
find
some
more
hospitable
place
and
walking
as
before
by
the
lady
s
side
but
he
was
not
suffered
to
proceed
far
for
sir
turpin
filled
with
hatred
and
malice
pursued
after
him
and
overtook
him
and
having
him
at
a
disadvantage
for
he
had
the
charge
of
the
lady
on
his
hands
went
near
to
slaying
him
slain
without
doubt
he
had
been
but
for
help
that
came
to
him
beyond
all
hope
a
savage
man
who
dwelt
in
the
wood
hearing
the
lady
s
cry
hastened
to
discover
what
had
befallen
he
was
as
a
brute
beast
and
had
never
before
felt
in
his
breast
any
touch
of
pity
but
now
seeing
the
knight
so
hardly
pressed
was
moved
to
help
him
neither
armour
had
he
nor
arms
being
wont
to
strike
with
such
things
as
came
to
his
hand
and
for
protection
he
had
a
magic
charm
which
from
his
birth
had
made
him
proof
against
all
wounds
he
took
no
thought
how
he
could
best
attack
sir
turpin
but
ran
at
him
with
great
fury
the
knight
struck
him
full
upon
the
breast
with
his
spear
but
made
no
wound
and
when
the
wild
man
s
fury
grew
greater
and
greater
and
he
caught
hold
of
the
knight
s
shield
and
the
knight
on
the
other
hand
perceived
that
neither
spear
nor
sword
availed
anything
against
him
then
sir
turpin
left
his
shield
and
his
spear
also
and
fled
nor
had
he
then
escaped
but
for
the
fleetness
of
his
steed
for
the
savage
also
was
the
fastest
of
runners
so
near
did
he
come
that
sir
turpin
shrieked
aloud
for
fear
a
most
unbecoming
thing
for
a
knight
to
do
nevertheless
by
the
speed
of
his
horse
he
escaped
to
his
castle
the
savage
man
therefore
seeing
his
labour
of
pursuit
to
be
vain
returned
to
the
place
where
he
had
left
the
knight
and
the
lady
both
he
found
in
very
evil
case
and
tended
them
with
all
care
staunching
the
bleeding
of
their
wounds
with
juices
of
healing
herbs
which
he
found
in
the
woods
also
he
took
them
to
a
dwelling
which
he
had
in
the
wood
hard
by
and
gave
them
such
entertainment
as
he
could
beds
of
leaves
on
which
to
sleep
and
wild
fruits
of
the
wood
for
food
for
the
savage
man
never
would
slay
any
living
creature
but
now
there
befell
these
lovers
a
great
mishap
sir
calepine
being
now
whole
of
his
wounds
was
wandering
in
the
wood
when
he
heard
the
cry
of
an
infant
which
a
bear
was
carrying
off
in
his
mouth
this
indeed
he
rescued
but
in
the
chase
went
so
far
that
he
wholly
lost
his
way
and
could
not
by
any
means
return
to
the
place
where
he
had
left
the
lady
serena
long
did
she
wait
for
his
coming
being
in
great
doubt
and
trouble
as
to
what
had
befallen
him
and
when
after
many
days
he
was
still
absent
she
purposed
to
leave
the
abode
of
the
savage
man
he
would
not
suffer
her
to
go
alone
but
clad
himself
in
sir
calepine
s
sword
the
knight
had
put
in
some
secret
so
set
forth
nor
indeed
was
ever
a
stranger
pair
seen
in
company
they
had
not
journeyed
far
before
by
great
good
fortune
they
met
prince
arthur
to
him
serena
told
all
that
had
befallen
her
and
sir
calepine
the
misdeeds
of
sir
turpin
and
the
wandering
away
of
the
knight
and
when
prince
arthur
had
heard
her
tale
he
said
you
i
will
bestow
with
a
good
and
wise
man
a
hermit
who
dwells
in
these
parts
my
squire
also
who
has
suffered
no
little
damage
i
will
leave
as
for
this
discourteous
knight
who
calls
himself
turpin
i
will
punish
him
and
this
he
did
in
most
effective
fashion
slaying
him
and
hanging
him
after
by
the
heels
upon
a
tree
that
others
might
take
warning
by
his
punishment
and
now
shall
be
told
what
befell
the
lady
serena
and
how
it
came
to
pass
that
she
and
her
lover
were
found
one
of
another
it
chanced
one
day
as
she
walked
in
the
wood
with
prince
arthur
s
squire
that
he
was
set
upon
by
two
knaves
and
she
doubting
to
what
end
the
battle
might
come
fled
away
on
her
feet
and
losing
her
way
could
not
by
any
means
return
to
the
hermit
s
abode
being
wearied
out
with
long
wandering
she
lay
down
in
the
wood
to
sleep
now
there
dwelt
in
those
parts
a
savage
tribe
which
was
wont
to
live
by
robbery
they
did
not
till
the
ground
nor
breed
cattle
nor
deal
in
merchandise
but
they
lived
by
spoiling
of
their
neighbours
goods
and
they
had
this
evil
custom
also
that
they
lived
on
the
flesh
of
men
devouring
all
strangers
whom
they
might
chance
to
find
within
their
borders
some
of
these
savages
as
they
wandered
in
the
forest
chanced
to
see
serena
as
she
lay
asleep
great
was
their
joy
to
see
her
not
for
her
beauty
but
because
she
would
make
they
thought
so
goodly
a
meal
first
they
debated
whether
they
should
wake
her
or
let
her
sleep
and
it
seemed
to
them
better
that
she
should
sleep
her
fill
she
will
be
the
better
they
said
for
her
also
they
agreed
together
that
she
should
be
offered
in
sacrifice
to
their
god
he
said
they
shall
have
her
blood
and
we
after
the
sacrifice
will
have
a
goodly
feast
on
her
this
they
set
about
to
do
and
having
built
an
altar
they
stripped
her
of
her
ornaments
and
robes
and
laid
her
upon
it
and
the
priest
stood
ready
to
slay
her
with
a
knife
of
stone
in
his
hand
when
their
evil
purpose
was
baulked
sir
calepine
by
some
happy
chance
had
come
to
this
same
grove
which
they
had
fixed
for
the
place
of
the
sacrifice
and
for
the
feast
which
was
to
come
after
he
was
still
searching
for
serena
and
having
travelled
far
that
day
had
laid
himself
down
to
sleep
and
now
there
being
a
great
noise
of
bagpipes
and
horns
for
with
these
they
celebrated
the
solemnity
he
started
up
and
looking
through
the
branches
that
were
about
him
saw
the
altar
set
and
the
woman
lying
on
it
and
the
priest
stretching
out
his
hand
to
slay
her
who
she
was
he
knew
not
but
ran
to
her
help
as
was
a
knight
s
duty
and
the
priest
he
slew
and
not
a
few
of
the
savages
that
were
gathered
round
and
the
rest
fled
like
to
doves
that
fly
before
a
hawk
so
did
sir
calepine
recover
the
lady
of
his
love
chapter
xxxviii
of
sir
calidore
and
pastorella
now
must
be
told
what
befell
sir
calidore
in
his
quest
for
many
days
he
pursued
unceasingly
the
blatant
beast
over
hills
and
through
valleys
through
forests
and
across
plains
he
made
his
way
and
wearied
not
the
monster
he
suffered
not
to
rest
nor
did
he
rest
himself
save
only
when
nature
commanded
for
he
feared
disgrace
if
haply
should
he
for
reason
of
sloth
forego
his
task
and
the
monster
should
escape
therefore
he
went
from
court
to
city
and
from
city
to
country
and
in
the
country
nothing
would
content
him
but
he
must
search
in
every
farm
on
a
day
while
he
thus
urged
the
pursuit
he
came
on
a
company
of
shepherds
who
were
playing
on
pipes
and
singing
country
ballads
the
while
their
flocks
fed
near
them
among
the
broom
bushes
with
their
flowers
of
gold
when
he
came
near
to
them
he
inquired
of
them
whether
they
had
chanced
to
see
such
a
beast
as
he
sought
they
answered
him
we
have
seen
none
such
in
this
country
nor
have
we
anything
that
threatens
harm
to
us
or
to
our
flocks
and
we
pray
to
the
good
god
that
he
will
keep
such
creatures
far
from
and
one
of
them
perceiving
that
the
knight
was
hot
and
weary
offered
him
drink
and
if
he
chanced
to
be
hungry
something
that
he
might
eat
this
courteous
offer
he
gladly
accepted
and
sat
him
down
well
content
with
such
simple
fare
as
suits
the
dweller
in
the
country
when
he
had
ended
his
meal
he
saw
a
fair
damsel
who
wore
a
crown
of
flowers
tied
with
ribbons
of
silk
being
clad
in
a
gown
of
green
which
she
had
worked
with
her
own
hands
she
sat
on
a
little
hillock
in
the
middle
of
the
company
with
company
of
lovely
maids
about
her
and
round
these
again
was
a
ring
of
shepherds
piping
and
singing
the
praises
of
their
queen
for
indeed
she
did
shine
as
a
queen
in
the
midst
of
her
subjects
fair
of
face
she
was
and
of
just
proportions
and
commended
her
beauty
to
all
beholders
by
the
modesty
of
her
carriage
there
was
not
one
in
the
place
but
honoured
and
not
a
few
sighed
for
her
in
love
but
she
had
no
liking
for
anyone
greatly
did
sir
calidore
admire
both
her
beauty
and
her
carriage
for
they
seemed
to
him
to
far
excel
the
shepherd
s
estate
surely
he
said
to
himself
this
may
be
a
princess
who
thus
disguises
her
high
and
even
while
he
thought
the
thought
in
his
heart
love
took
him
unawares
so
he
sat
musing
and
for
a
while
so
taken
was
his
heart
with
this
new
thought
forgot
the
chase
and
now
the
evening
was
come
and
it
behoved
the
shepherds
to
fold
their
flocks
so
there
came
an
aged
sire
melibæus
by
name
who
was
commonly
reputed
to
be
the
father
of
the
fair
was
her
name
so
indeed
it
was
believed
but
in
very
truth
he
had
found
her
as
an
infant
lying
in
an
open
field
and
taking
her
home
had
brought
her
up
as
his
child
for
child
of
his
very
own
he
had
none
the
old
man
said
night
falls
and
we
must
fold
the
nor
was
there
any
want
of
helpers
to
the
fair
pastorella
many
were
eager
to
manage
her
sheep
and
none
more
eager
than
corydon
then
melibæus
seeing
how
sir
calidore
sat
alone
seeming
to
have
no
place
of
abode
and
that
night
was
now
near
at
hand
said
to
him
fair
sir
i
have
but
a
humble
cottage
yet
is
this
a
better
lodging
than
the
bare
field
i
pray
you
to
take
up
your
abode
with
me
this
to
which
sir
calidore
gladly
agreed
for
indeed
there
was
nothing
that
he
more
desired
a
hearty
welcome
did
the
old
man
and
his
wife
accord
to
the
knight
shortly
after
the
fair
pastorella
came
back
from
folding
her
flock
and
they
all
sat
down
to
sup
in
high
content
and
had
much
pleasant
talk
concerning
the
shepherd
s
life
the
delights
of
which
old
melibæus
set
forth
let
those
who
will
seek
after
honour
and
wealth
and
the
good
things
of
this
world
i
am
content
with
what
i
have
my
nights
i
spend
in
quiet
sleep
my
days
in
honest
toil
i
take
good
care
that
the
fox
shall
not
harm
my
lambs
i
catch
birds
in
snares
and
fishes
with
hook
and
net
when
i
am
weary
i
rest
my
limbs
under
the
green
tree
when
i
am
thirsty
i
drink
of
the
brook
time
was
when
i
was
not
content
with
these
simple
things
but
must
raise
myself
above
my
fellows
and
seek
fortune
elsewhere
so
i
left
my
home
and
betook
myself
to
the
king
s
court
and
worked
for
hire
but
i
perceived
that
in
this
life
there
was
vanity
and
discontent
after
ten
years
therefore
had
passed
i
came
back
to
my
home
and
to
peace
and
i
have
learnt
to
love
it
daily
more
and
while
the
good
man
talked
the
knight
was
well
content
to
listen
much
he
liked
to
hear
such
speech
but
more
to
look
at
the
fair
pastorella
after
a
while
he
said
to
the
old
man
good
father
i
would
gladly
rest
a
while
in
this
peaceful
place
the
ship
of
my
life
has
of
late
been
greatly
tossed
by
tempestuous
winds
and
in
stormy
seas
let
it
therefore
find
haven
here
and
i
meanwhile
will
meditate
what
course
i
shall
follow
for
the
time
to
come
but
i
would
not
that
my
entertainment
should
be
a
burden
to
you
your
simple
fare
and
such
lodging
as
you
can
give
content
me
well
but
for
these
you
should
have
fair
so
saying
he
drew
from
his
pouch
a
great
store
of
gold
and
would
have
the
old
man
take
it
but
melibæus
pushed
it
from
him
i
desire
it
not
he
said
this
is
the
thing
that
breeds
such
mischief
in
the
world
but
if
you
are
content
to
abide
here
and
lead
our
shepherd
s
life
be
it
so
i
am
well
so
sir
calidore
abode
in
the
old
man
s
house
delighting
himself
with
the
daily
sight
of
the
fair
pastorella
and
bearing
her
company
whenever
he
could
find
excuse
very
high
courtesy
did
he
show
to
the
maid
but
she
having
been
used
to
more
lowly
things
held
it
in
but
light
esteem
this
the
knight
did
not
fail
to
perceive
so
he
doffed
his
knightly
attire
and
clad
himself
in
shepherd
s
dress
and
laid
aside
his
spear
for
a
shepherd
s
crook
one
had
thought
him
another
paris
when
for
œnone
s
sake
he
fed
her
flocks
on
the
phrygian
ida
so
did
the
shepherd
calidore
go
day
by
day
to
the
fields
with
pastorella
s
flock
he
kept
watch
against
the
wolf
while
the
maid
sported
and
played
and
at
is
the
might
of
would
essay
to
help
in
the
milking
of
the
ewes
these
things
were
little
to
the
liking
of
corydon
who
had
long
courted
the
maid
he
wore
a
scowling
face
and
would
complain
that
old
service
was
forgotten
and
bore
himself
in
most
injurious
fashion
calidore
on
the
other
hand
never
abated
one
jot
of
his
usual
courtesy
showing
no
sign
of
rancour
or
offence
but
rather
seeking
as
it
seemed
to
commend
his
rival
to
the
good
opinion
of
the
maid
so
when
they
danced
to
the
piping
of
colin
clout
and
the
others
would
have
calidore
lead
the
ring
the
knight
took
corydon
and
set
him
in
his
place
and
when
pastorella
took
the
garland
of
flowers
from
her
head
and
set
it
on
calidore
s
he
again
put
it
on
the
head
of
corydon
much
to
the
youth
s
content
another
time
when
the
shepherds
had
games
and
contests
of
skill
and
strength
the
prize
being
a
garland
which
the
fair
pastorella
had
twined
with
her
own
hands
corydon
stepped
into
the
ring
and
challenged
the
knight
to
a
bout
of
wrestling
he
was
himself
well
skilled
in
the
art
and
being
supple
and
strong
sought
to
put
his
rival
to
open
shame
but
he
was
much
mistaken
in
his
man
for
the
knight
far
excelled
him
both
in
strength
and
in
skill
and
gave
him
such
a
fall
as
broke
his
neck
nevertheless
when
pastorella
bestowed
on
him
the
crown
he
passed
it
to
corydon
saying
that
he
in
truth
deserved
it
more
and
that
he
had
prevailed
by
fortune
rather
than
by
skill
thus
did
the
knight
so
courteous
was
he
and
large
of
heart
win
the
fair
maiden
s
favour
but
there
was
nothing
which
advanced
him
more
than
that
which
is
now
to
be
told
on
a
certain
day
when
these
three
to
wit
pastorella
and
sir
calidore
and
the
shepherd
corydon
went
out
into
the
wood
to
gather
strawberries
a
tiger
suddenly
rushed
out
from
a
thicket
and
with
wide
gaping
mouth
ran
at
the
maid
she
seeing
herself
alone
for
her
companions
chanced
to
be
divided
from
her
cried
aloud
for
succour
and
when
corydon
who
was
the
nearer
of
the
two
heard
the
cry
he
ran
to
help
her
but
when
he
saw
how
fierce
a
beast
it
was
that
was
attacking
her
his
courage
failed
him
and
he
fled
putting
his
life
before
his
love
but
calidore
who
also
had
heard
the
crying
coming
not
far
behind
when
he
saw
the
tiger
and
the
maiden
held
in
his
claws
ran
at
the
beast
with
all
his
strength
and
first
striking
him
to
the
ground
with
such
a
blow
that
the
creature
could
not
stand
under
it
then
cut
off
its
head
and
laid
it
at
the
maiden
s
feet
small
wonder
is
it
that
she
gave
her
love
to
a
knight
so
courteous
and
so
bold
so
for
a
while
they
abode
in
great
content
save
that
sir
calidore
had
put
out
of
his
mind
the
quest
on
which
he
was
bound
concerning
which
quest
he
had
sworn
to
the
great
queen
gloriana
that
nothing
should
hinder
him
from
it
chapter
xxxix
the
end
of
sir
calidore
s
quest
it
chanced
one
day
that
while
sir
calidore
was
hunting
in
the
pleased
him
more
to
be
hunter
than
to
be
company
of
lawless
men
who
never
used
the
spade
or
plough
but
lived
by
the
spoiling
of
their
neighbours
fell
upon
the
shepherds
village
and
spoiled
their
houses
and
drove
away
their
flocks
many
of
the
men
they
slew
and
many
they
led
away
captives
among
these
was
old
melibæus
and
the
fair
pastorella
and
also
corydon
these
the
brigands
carried
away
to
an
island
where
they
dwelt
a
close
place
hidden
with
great
woods
round
about
meaning
when
occasion
offered
to
sell
them
to
merchants
who
dealt
in
such
wares
when
they
had
remained
in
ward
for
a
while
the
captain
of
the
brigands
seeing
pastorella
how
fair
she
was
conceived
a
great
love
for
her
and
when
she
spake
him
fair
would
have
had
her
marry
him
this
she
was
to
do
but
could
not
devise
any
other
means
to
stay
his
importunities
than
to
feign
a
sudden
sickness
while
she
was
making
this
pretence
there
came
to
the
island
a
company
of
slave
merchants
who
inquiring
whether
there
were
any
of
the
wares
in
which
they
dealt
were
brought
to
the
captain
sir
said
the
brigands
to
the
captain
here
be
the
merchants
twould
be
well
that
all
the
captives
whom
we
have
should
be
brought
out
and
sold
for
such
a
price
as
may
be
agreed
upon
and
the
money
divided
in
equal
to
this
the
captain
could
not
but
consent
the
captives
therefore
were
brought
forward
melibæus
and
corydon
and
the
others
and
the
merchants
set
a
price
upon
them
this
being
finished
said
one
of
the
brigands
there
is
yet
another
captive
a
very
fair
maid
for
whom
without
doubt
you
would
pay
much
money
so
beautiful
is
she
to
look
nay
cried
the
captain
that
maid
is
not
for
selling
she
is
my
wife
nor
has
anyone
any
concern
with
her
she
too
is
now
so
wasted
and
worn
with
sickness
that
no
one
would
be
willing
to
pay
for
her
a
price
however
so
he
took
them
to
the
chamber
where
she
abode
a
poor
place
it
was
gloomy
and
dark
and
the
maiden
was
wasted
and
wan
nevertheless
the
merchants
were
astonished
at
her
beauty
the
others
said
their
spokesman
are
but
common
wares
we
will
buy
them
if
you
will
but
on
this
condition
only
that
we
may
buy
this
maiden
and
he
named
for
her
a
price
of
a
thousand
pieces
of
gold
the
captain
s
wrath
was
much
moved
at
these
words
my
love
he
cried
shall
not
be
sold
with
the
others
you
may
do
as
you
will
but
to
her
i
nay
said
the
one
who
was
chief
among
the
brigands
you
do
us
great
wrong
we
have
our
equal
share
in
her
and
we
demand
that
she
be
sold
with
the
when
he
heard
this
the
captain
drew
his
sword
from
its
sheath
and
shouted
that
anyone
who
should
dare
lay
hands
on
her
should
straightway
die
on
this
there
followed
a
great
battle
but
first
they
slew
the
prisoners
lest
haply
they
should
turn
against
the
weaker
side
thus
did
old
melibæus
die
and
with
him
many
others
but
corydon
escaped
this
being
done
the
thieves
fought
among
themselves
and
soon
the
captain
who
was
ever
more
careful
of
pastorella
than
of
his
own
life
was
slain
and
she
being
wounded
with
the
same
stroke
by
which
he
was
bereft
of
life
fell
upon
the
ground
being
hidden
under
a
pile
of
dead
bodies
the
captain
being
dead
the
strife
of
which
he
was
the
beginning
and
the
chief
cause
soon
came
to
an
end
the
brigands
searching
among
the
dead
found
the
maid
still
lived
though
sorely
wounded
they
gave
her
therefore
such
care
as
could
be
found
in
so
rude
a
place
in
the
meanwhile
corydon
had
made
his
way
to
the
village
where
he
dwelt
and
there
he
encountered
the
knight
who
seeing
the
house
in
which
he
dwelt
utterly
spoiled
and
void
of
all
inhabitants
was
overwhelmed
with
trouble
and
fear
to
him
he
told
the
story
of
how
he
with
the
rest
had
been
led
into
captivity
and
how
the
brigands
had
fallen
out
among
themselves
and
how
the
captain
had
fought
with
the
others
and
had
been
slain
and
with
him
pastorella
for
so
the
shepherd
believed
for
a
while
sir
calidore
was
wholly
mastered
by
his
grief
yet
coming
to
himself
he
considered
that
corydon
had
not
seen
with
his
own
eyes
all
that
he
had
told
because
he
had
fled
away
before
the
strife
had
so
much
as
begun
and
so
hope
which
is
ever
hard
to
kill
in
the
hearts
of
men
sprang
up
within
him
and
he
made
a
great
resolve
that
he
would
find
her
if
she
yet
lived
or
avenge
her
if
she
had
died
he
therefore
said
to
corydon
come
now
and
show
me
the
place
where
these
brigands
dwell
which
thing
corydon
was
at
the
first
unwilling
to
do
for
he
was
not
minded
to
run
again
into
the
danger
from
which
he
had
escaped
nevertheless
sir
calidore
so
wrought
upon
him
that
he
consented
to
go
the
two
therefore
set
out
together
clad
in
shepherd
s
clothing
and
carrying
each
a
shepherd
s
crook
but
sir
calidore
had
donned
his
armour
after
a
while
they
saw
on
a
hill
which
was
not
far
away
some
flocks
and
shepherds
tending
them
and
approached
them
hoping
to
learn
something
about
the
matter
with
which
they
were
concerned
then
they
perceived
that
these
flocks
were
indeed
the
same
as
the
brigands
had
driven
away
for
corydon
knew
his
own
sheep
when
he
saw
them
and
wept
for
pity
being
in
grievous
fear
because
he
perceived
that
they
who
kept
them
were
none
other
than
the
brigands
themselves
these
however
were
but
ill
shepherds
for
they
lay
fast
asleep
corydon
would
have
had
sir
calidore
slay
them
as
they
slept
but
the
knight
hoped
that
he
might
gain
from
them
some
tidings
of
her
whom
he
was
seeking
so
waking
them
gently
he
gave
them
courteous
greeting
and
when
the
brigands
would
know
who
he
was
he
answered
that
he
and
his
companion
were
used
to
the
keeping
of
cattle
and
the
like
and
now
having
run
away
from
their
masters
sought
to
find
service
elsewhere
take
service
then
with
us
said
the
brigands
for
this
work
is
not
to
our
to
this
the
two
agreed
and
took
charge
accordingly
when
night
fell
the
brigands
took
them
to
the
cave
where
they
dwelt
there
sir
calidore
learnt
many
things
which
he
desired
to
know
and
chief
of
all
that
pastorella
was
yet
alive
at
midnight
when
all
were
sleeping
sound
sir
calidore
fully
armed
for
he
had
found
a
sword
though
but
of
the
meanest
sort
went
to
the
cave
wherein
dwelt
the
new
captain
of
the
band
it
was
indeed
barred
but
the
knight
soon
broke
down
the
bars
and
when
the
captain
roused
by
the
noise
came
running
to
the
entrance
slew
him
pastorella
being
within
was
at
the
first
not
a
little
alarmed
at
this
new
intruder
yet
was
greatly
comforted
to
see
again
her
own
lover
and
he
also
was
overcome
with
joy
and
catching
her
in
his
arms
kissed
her
most
tenderly
meanwhile
the
thieves
had
gathered
together
perceiving
that
some
new
danger
threatened
them
but
sir
calidore
standing
in
the
opening
slew
them
as
they
approached
in
the
end
he
utterly
vanquished
the
whole
company
and
spoiled
their
goods
as
for
the
sheep
he
gave
them
as
a
gift
to
corydon
the
fair
pastorella
he
bestowed
in
the
house
of
a
certain
sir
bellamour
and
the
lady
claribell
his
wife
now
must
be
told
the
true
name
and
lineage
of
this
same
maiden
pastorella
sir
bellamour
in
former
time
had
served
a
very
great
lord
of
those
parts
who
had
one
daughter
claribell
by
name
this
same
lord
had
promised
her
in
marriage
to
the
lord
of
pictland
which
was
the
neighbouring
dominion
thinking
that
the
two
domains
might
thus
be
conveniently
joined
together
claribell
meanwhile
loved
sir
bellamour
who
was
a
very
gallant
knight
so
fondly
did
she
love
him
that
she
consented
to
a
secret
wedlock
having
good
hopes
that
her
father
might
relent
but
when
he
continued
to
be
hard
of
heart
she
having
borne
a
maiden
babe
was
constrained
to
commit
the
child
to
a
woman
who
waited
upon
her
this
same
woman
taking
the
babe
into
the
field
laid
it
under
a
bush
and
having
hidden
herself
hard
by
waited
to
see
what
should
happen
for
she
trusted
that
someone
hearing
its
cry
would
take
it
up
but
first
she
noted
that
it
had
on
its
breast
a
little
spot
of
purple
colour
like
to
a
rosebud
after
a
while
the
shepherd
melibæus
passing
by
heard
the
voice
of
the
babe
and
taking
it
from
its
place
carried
it
home
to
his
wife
who
being
herself
childless
gladly
took
it
in
charge
and
reared
it
for
her
own
no
long
time
after
the
lady
claribell
s
father
died
and
left
to
her
all
that
he
had
and
she
having
now
no
cause
why
she
should
conceal
her
marriage
took
sir
bellamour
openly
for
her
husband
and
had
lived
with
him
in
great
content
until
the
coming
of
sir
calidore
into
those
parts
and
now
sir
calidore
bethought
him
of
his
quest
that
he
must
not
delay
its
accomplishment
any
longer
and
indeed
he
feared
lest
he
should
suffer
in
fame
because
he
had
put
it
aside
in
thinking
of
other
things
now
therefore
he
departed
leaving
pastorella
in
the
charge
of
the
lady
claribell
the
same
undertaking
this
care
most
willingly
for
the
maid
was
fair
and
gracious
and
was
altogether
one
to
be
loved
sir
bellamour
also
having
a
friendship
for
sir
calidore
with
whom
he
had
served
the
queen
gloriana
in
time
past
was
glad
to
help
him
in
this
fashion
it
chanced
on
a
day
that
the
lady
claribell
s
waiting
woman
melissa
by
name
being
the
same
that
in
time
past
had
served
her
in
the
matter
of
the
babe
was
doing
service
to
the
fair
pastorella
in
the
matter
of
her
attire
being
so
engaged
she
spied
the
mark
on
her
bosom
and
said
to
herself
surely
this
is
the
very
mark
of
a
rosebud
that
i
saw
on
the
lady
claribell
s
maiden
babe
and
the
years
of
her
age
as
far
as
may
be
guessed
agree
having
this
in
her
mind
she
ran
straightway
to
the
lady
her
mistress
and
unfolded
the
whole
matter
how
she
had
noted
the
mark
and
how
the
old
shepherd
had
taken
the
babe
from
the
ground
that
this
shepherd
and
his
wife
had
been
as
father
and
mother
to
the
maiden
was
of
common
knowledge
nor
did
the
lady
claribell
delay
to
search
out
the
matter
with
her
own
eyes
and
being
satisfied
that
this
was
indeed
her
very
child
took
her
to
herself
with
great
joy
as
did
also
her
husband
sir
bellamour
meanwhile
sir
calidore
pursued
the
blatant
beast
and
at
the
last
overtook
him
the
monster
having
spoiled
all
the
other
places
in
the
realm
was
wasting
the
church
robbing
the
chancel
and
fouling
the
altar
and
casting
down
all
the
goodly
ornaments
when
he
saw
the
knight
he
fled
knowing
that
he
was
in
peril
yet
could
he
not
escape
in
a
narrow
place
sir
calidore
overtook
him
and
compelled
him
to
turn
sore
was
the
conflict
between
these
two
for
the
beast
ran
at
the
knight
with
open
mouth
set
with
a
double
range
of
iron
teeth
between
which
were
a
thousand
tongues
giving
out
dreadful
cries
as
of
all
manner
of
beasts
tongues
of
serpents
also
spitting
out
poison
and
of
all
other
venomous
things
that
are
upon
the
earth
not
one
whit
dismayed
the
knight
ran
in
upon
him
and
when
the
monster
lifted
himself
up
on
his
hind
legs
and
would
have
rent
him
with
his
claws
he
threw
his
shield
between
and
held
him
down
vainly
did
the
beast
rage
and
strive
to
lift
himself
from
the
ground
the
more
he
strove
the
more
hardly
and
heavily
did
the
knight
press
upon
him
at
the
last
when
the
creature
s
strength
now
failed
him
the
knight
put
a
great
muzzle
of
iron
with
many
links
in
his
mouth
so
that
he
should
no
more
send
forth
those
evil
voices
and
to
the
muzzle
he
fastened
a
long
chain
with
which
he
led
him
he
following
as
a
dog
so
utterly
was
he
subdued
through
all
fairyland
he
led
him
the
people
thronging
out
of
their
towns
to
see
him
and
much
admiring
the
knight
who
by
his
great
strength
and
valour
had
subdued
so
foul
and
fierce
a
creature
tis
true
that
in
after
days
whether
by
some
evil
chance
or
by
the
folly
of
those
who
had
charge
of
the
monster
these
bonds
were
broken
for
even
now
the
creature
wanders
about
the
world
doing
great
harm
to
all
estates
of
men
for
it
must
be
known
that
his
name
is
slander
but
in
the
good
times
of
old
it
was
not
so
so
did
sir
calidore
fulfil
his
quest
and
afterwards
he
lived
in
all
happiness
as
became
so
brave
and
loyal
a
knight

his
wedded
wife

the
