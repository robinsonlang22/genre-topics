this
book
is
affectionately
dedicated
preface
the
story
contained
in
this
volume
is
a
record
of
youthful
struggles
not
only
in
the
world
without
but
in
the
world
within
and
the
success
of
the
little
hero
is
not
merely
a
gathering
up
of
wealth
and
honors
but
a
triumph
over
the
temptations
that
beset
the
pilgrim
on
the
plain
of
life
the
attainment
of
worldly
prosperity
is
not
the
truest
victory
and
the
author
has
endeavored
to
make
the
interest
of
his
story
depend
more
on
the
hero
devotion
to
principles
than
on
his
success
in
business
bobby
bright
is
a
smart
boy
perhaps
the
reader
will
think
he
is
altogether
too
smart
for
one
of
his
years
this
is
a
progressive
age
and
anything
which
young
america
may
do
need
not
surprise
any
person
that
little
gentleman
is
older
than
his
father
knows
more
than
his
mother
can
talk
politics
smoke
cigars
and
drive
a
horse
he
orders
one
stew
with
as
much
ease
as
a
man
of
forty
and
can
even
pronounce
correctly
the
villanous
names
of
sundry
french
and
german
wines
and
liqueurs
one
would
suppose
to
hear
him
talk
that
he
had
been
intimate
with
socrates
and
solon
with
napoleon
and
noah
webster
in
short
that
whatever
he
did
not
know
was
not
worth
knowing
in
the
face
of
these
manifestations
of
exuberant
genius
it
would
be
absurd
to
accuse
the
author
of
making
his
hero
do
too
much
all
he
has
done
is
to
give
this
genius
a
right
direction
and
for
politics
cigars
horses
and
one
stew
he
has
substituted
the
duties
of
a
rational
and
accountable
being
regarding
them
as
better
fitted
to
develop
the
young
gentleman
mind
heart
and
soul
bobby
bright
is
something
more
than
a
smart
boy
he
is
a
good
boy
and
makes
a
true
man
his
daily
life
is
the
moral
of
the
story
and
the
author
hopes
that
his
devotion
to
principle
will
make
a
stronger
impression
upon
the
mind
of
the
young
reader
than
even
the
most
exciting
incidents
of
his
eventful

in

by
jolly
i
got
a
bite
exclaimed
tom
spicer
a
rough
boy
who
sat
on
a
rock
by
the
river
side
anxiously
watching
the
cork
float
on
his
line
catch
him
then
quietly
responded
bobby
bright
who
occupied
another
rock
near
the
first
speaker
as
he
pulled
up
a
large
pout
and
without
any
appearance
of
exultation
proceeded
to
unhook
and
place
him
in
his
basket
you
are
a
lucky
dog
bob
added
tom
as
he
glanced
into
the
basket
of
his
companion
which
now
contained
six
fishes
i
have
caught
one
yet
you
do
fish
deep
enough
i
fish
on
the
bottom
that
is
too
deep
it
do
make
any
difference
how
i
fish
it
is
all
luck
not
all
luck
tom
there
is
something
in
doing
it
right
i
shall
not
catch
a
fish
continued
tom
in
despair
you
catch
something
else
though
when
you
go
home
will
i
i
afraid
you
will
who
says
i
will
did
you
tell
me
you
were
jack
who
is
going
to
know
anything
about
it
the
master
will
know
you
are
absent
i
shall
tell
him
my
mother
sent
me
over
to
the
village
on
an
errand
i
never
knew
a
fellow
to
jack
yet
without
getting
found
out
i
shall
not
get
found
out
unless
you
blow
on
me
and
you
would
be
mean
enough
to
do
that
and
tom
glanced
uneasily
at
his
companion
suppose
your
mother
should
ask
me
if
i
had
seen
you
you
would
tell
her
you
have
not
of
course
of
course
why
would
you
would
you
do
as
much
as
that
for
a
fellow
it
would
be
a
lie
a
lie
humph
i
would
lie
for
any
fellow
replied
bobby
stoutly
as
he
pulled
in
his
seventh
fish
and
placed
him
in
the
basket
would
you
no
i
would
then
let
me
tell
you
this
if
you
peach
on
me
i
smash
your
head
tom
spicer
removed
one
hand
from
the
fish
pole
and
doubling
his
fist
shook
it
with
energy
at
his
companion
smash
away
replied
bobby
coolly
i
shall
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
tell
tales
but
if
your
mother
or
the
master
asks
me
the
question
i
shall
not
lie
wo
you
no
i
wo
i
bet
you
will
and
tom
dropped
his
fish
pole
and
was
on
the
point
of
jumping
over
to
the
rock
occupied
by
bobby
when
the
float
of
the
former
disappeared
beneath
the
surface
of
the
water
you
got
a
bite
coolly
interposed
bobby
pointing
to
the
line
tom
snatched
the
pole
and
with
a
violent
twitch
pulled
up
a
big
pout
but
his
violence
jerked
the
hook
out
of
the
fish
mouth
and
he
disappeared
beneath
the
surface
of
the
river
just
my
luck
muttered
tom
keep
cool
then
i
will
fix
you
yet
all
right
but
you
had
better
not
let
go
your
pole
again
or
you
will
lose
another
fish
i
bound
to
smash
your
head
though
no
you
wo
wo
i
two
can
play
at
that
game
do
you
stump
me
no
i
do
want
to
fight
i
wo
fight
if
i
can
help
it
i
bet
you
wo
sneered
tom
but
i
will
defend
myself
humph
i
am
not
a
liar
and
the
fear
of
a
flogging
shall
not
make
me
tell
a
lie
go
to
sunday
school
do
you
i
do
and
besides
that
my
mother
always
taught
me
never
to
tell
a
lie
come
you
need
preach
to
me
by
and
by
you
will
call
me
a
liar
no
i
wo
but
just
now
you
told
me
you
meant
to
lie
to
your
mother
and
to
the
master
what
if
i
did
that
is
none
of
your
business
it
my
business
when
you
want
me
to
lie
for
you
though
and
i
shall
not
do
it
blow
on
me
and
see
what
you
will
get
i
do
mean
to
blow
on
you
yes
you
do
i
will
not
lie
about
it
that
all
by
jolly
see
that
horse
exclaimed
tom
suddenly
as
he
pointed
to
the
road
leading
to
riverdale
centre
by
gracious
added
bobby
dropping
his
fish
pole
as
he
saw
the
horse
running
at
a
furious
rate
up
the
road
from
the
village
the
mad
animal
was
attached
to
a
chaise
in
which
was
seated
a
lady
whose
frantic
shrieks
pierced
the
soul
of
our
youthful
hero
the
course
of
the
road
was
by
the
river
side
for
nearly
half
a
mile
and
crossed
the
stream
at
a
wooden
bridge
but
a
few
rods
from
the
place
where
the
boys
were
fishing
bobby
bright
impulses
were
noble
and
generous
and
without
stopping
to
consider
the
peril
to
which
the
attempt
would
expose
him
he
boldly
resolved
to
stop
that
horse
or
let
the
animal
dash
him
to
pieces
on
the
bridge
now
or
never
shouted
he
as
he
leaped
from
the
rock
and
ran
with
all
his
might
to
the
bridge
the
shrieks
of
the
lady
rang
in
his
ears
and
seemed
to
command
him
with
an
authority
which
he
could
not
resist
to
stop
the
horse
there
was
no
time
for
deliberation
and
indeed
bobby
did
not
want
any
deliberation
the
lady
was
in
danger
if
the
horse
flight
was
not
checked
she
would
be
dashed
in
pieces
and
what
then
could
excuse
him
for
neglecting
his
duty
not
the
fear
of
broken
limbs
of
mangled
flesh
or
even
of
a
sudden
and
violent
death
it
is
true
bobby
did
not
think
of
any
of
these
things
though
if
he
had
it
would
have
made
no
difference
with
him
he
was
a
boy
who
would
not
fight
except
in
but
he
had
the
courage
to
do
a
deed
which
might
have
made
the
stoutest
heart
tremble
with
terror
grasping
a
broken
rail
as
he
leaped
over
the
fence
he
planted
himself
in
the
middle
of
the
bridge
which
was
not
more
than
half
as
wide
as
the
road
at
each
end
of
it
to
await
the
coming
of
the
furious
animal
on
he
came
and
the
piercing
shrieks
of
the
affrighted
lady
nerved
him
to
the
performance
of
his
perilous
duty
the
horse
approached
him
at
a
mad
run
and
his
feet
struck
the
loose
planks
of
the
bridge
the
brave
boy
then
raised
his
big
club
and
brandished
it
with
all
his
might
in
the
air
probably
the
horse
did
not
mean
anything
very
bad
was
only
frightened
and
had
no
wicked
intentions
towards
the
lady
so
that
when
a
new
danger
menaced
him
in
front
he
stopped
suddenly
and
with
so
much
violence
as
to
throw
the
lady
forward
from
her
seat
upon
the
dasher
of
the
chaise
he
gave
a
long
snort
which
was
his
way
of
expressing
his
fear
he
was
evidently
astonished
at
the
sudden
barrier
to
his
further
progress
and
commenced
running
back
save
me
screamed
the
lady
i
will
do
be
scared
replied
bobby
confidently
as
he
dropped
his
club
and
grasped
the
bridle
of
the
horse
just
as
he
was
on
the
point
of
whirling
round
to
escape
by
the
way
he
had
come
stop
him
do
stop
him
cried
the
lady
whoa
said
bobby
in
gentle
tones
as
he
patted
the
trembling
horse
on
his
neck
whoa
good
horse
be
quiet
whoa
the
animal
in
his
terror
kept
running
backward
and
forward
but
bobby
persevered
in
his
gentle
treatment
and
finally
soothed
him
so
that
he
stood
quiet
enough
for
the
lady
to
get
out
of
the
chaise
what
a
miracle
that
i
am
alive
exclaimed
she
when
she
realized
that
she
stood
once
more
upon
the
firm
earth
yes
it
is
lucky
he
did
break
the
chaise
whoa
good
horse
stand
quiet
what
a
brave
little
fellow
you
are
said
the
lady
as
soon
as
she
could
recover
her
breath
so
as
to
express
her
admiration
of
bold
act
o
i
do
mind
it
replied
he
blushing
like
a
rose
in
june
did
he
run
away
with
you
no
my
father
left
me
in
the
chaise
for
a
moment
while
he
went
into
a
store
in
the
village
and
a
teamster
who
was
passing
by
snapped
his
whip
which
frightened
kate
so
that
she
started
off
at
the
top
of
her
speed
i
was
so
terrified
that
i
screamed
with
all
my
might
which
frightened
her
the
more
the
more
i
screamed
the
faster
she
ran
i
dare
say
good
horse
whoa
kate
she
is
a
splendid
creature
she
never
did
such
a
thing
before
my
father
will
think
i
am
killed
by
this
time
kate
had
become
quite
reasonable
and
seemed
very
much
obliged
to
bobby
for
preventing
her
from
doing
mischief
to
her
mistress
for
she
looked
at
the
lady
with
a
glance
of
satisfaction
which
her
deliverer
interpreted
as
a
promise
to
behave
better
in
future
he
relaxed
his
grasp
upon
the
bridle
patted
her
upon
the
neck
and
said
sundry
pleasant
things
to
encourage
her
in
her
assumed
purpose
of
doing
better
kate
appeared
to
understand
bobby
kind
words
and
declared
as
plainly
as
a
horse
could
declare
that
she
would
be
sober
and
tractable
now
if
you
will
get
into
the
chaise
again
i
think
kate
will
let
me
drive
her
down
to
the
village
o
dear
i
should
not
dare
to
do
so
then
if
you
please
i
will
drive
down
alone
so
as
to
let
your
father
know
that
you
are
safe
do
i
am
sure
he
must
feel
very
bad
and
i
may
save
him
a
great
deal
of
pain
for
a
man
can
suffer
a
great
deal
in
a
very
short
time
you
are
a
little
philosopher
as
well
as
a
hero
and
if
you
are
not
afraid
of
kate
you
may
do
as
you
wish
she
seems
very
gentle
now
and
bobby
turned
her
round
and
got
into
the
chaise
be
very
careful
said
the
lady
i
will
bobby
took
the
reins
and
kate
true
to
the
promise
she
had
virtually
made
started
off
at
a
round
pace
towards
the
village
he
had
not
gone
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
the
distance
when
he
met
a
wagon
containing
three
men
one
of
whom
was
the
father
the
gestures
which
he
made
assured
bobby
he
had
found
the
person
whom
he
sought
and
he
stopped
my
daughter
where
is
she
gasped
the
gentleman
as
he
leaped
from
the
wagon
she
is
safe
sir
replied
bobby
with
all
the
enthusiasm
of
his
warm
nature
thank
god
added
the
gentleman
devoutly
as
he
placed
himself
in
the
chaise
by
the
side
of
bobby
chapter
ii
in
which
bobby
blushes
several
times
and
does
a
sum
in
arithmetic
bayard
the
owner
of
the
horse
and
the
father
of
the
lady
whom
bobby
had
saved
from
impending
death
was
too
much
agitated
to
say
much
even
to
the
bold
youth
who
had
rendered
him
such
a
signal
service
he
could
scarcely
believe
the
intelligence
which
the
boy
brought
him
it
seemed
too
good
to
be
true
he
had
assured
himself
that
ellen
for
that
was
the
young
lady
name
was
killed
or
dreadfully
injured
kate
was
driven
at
the
top
of
her
speed
and
in
a
few
moments
reached
the
bridge
where
ellen
was
awaiting
his
arrival
here
i
am
father
alive
and
unhurt
cried
ellen
as
bayard
stopped
the
horse
thank
heaven
my
child
replied
the
glad
father
embracing
his
daughter
i
was
sure
you
were
killed
no
father
thanks
to
this
bold
youth
i
am
uninjured
i
am
under
very
great
obligations
to
you
young
man
continued
bayard
grasping
bobby
hand
o
never
mind
sir
and
bobby
blushed
just
as
he
had
blushed
when
the
young
lady
spoke
to
him
we
shall
never
forget
you
shall
we
father
added
ellen
no
my
child
and
i
shall
endeavor
to
repay
to
some
slight
extent
our
indebtedness
to
him
but
you
have
not
yet
told
me
how
you
were
saved
o
i
merely
stopped
the
horse
that
all
answered
bobby
modestly
yes
father
but
he
placed
himself
right
before
kate
when
she
was
almost
flying
over
the
ground
when
i
saw
him
i
was
certain
that
he
would
lose
his
life
or
be
horribly
mangled
for
his
boldness
interposed
ellen
it
was
a
daring
deed
young
man
to
place
yourself
before
an
affrighted
horse
in
that
manner
said
bayard
i
did
mind
it
sir
and
then
he
flourished
a
big
club
almost
as
big
as
he
is
himself
in
the
air
which
made
kate
pause
in
her
mad
career
when
my
deliverer
here
grasped
her
by
the
bit
and
held
her
it
was
well
and
bravely
done
that
it
was
father
not
many
men
would
have
been
bold
enough
to
do
what
he
did
added
ellen
with
enthusiasm
very
true
and
i
feel
that
i
am
indebted
to
him
for
your
safety
what
is
your
name
young
man
robert
bright
sir
bayard
took
from
his
pocket
several
pieces
of
gold
which
he
offered
to
bobby
no
i
thank
you
sir
replied
bobby
blushing
what
as
proud
as
you
are
bold
i
do
like
to
be
paid
for
doing
my
duty
bravo
you
are
a
noble
little
fellow
but
you
must
take
this
money
not
as
a
reward
for
what
you
have
done
but
as
a
testimonial
of
my
gratitude
i
would
rather
not
sir
do
take
it
robert
added
ellen
i
do
like
to
take
it
it
looks
mean
to
take
money
for
doing
duty
take
it
robert
to
please
me
and
the
young
lady
smiled
so
sweetly
that
bobby
resolution
began
to
give
way
only
to
please
me
robert
i
will
to
please
you
but
i
do
feel
right
about
it
you
must
not
be
too
proud
robert
said
bayard
as
he
put
the
gold
pieces
into
his
hand
i
am
not
proud
sir
only
i
do
like
to
be
paid
for
doing
my
duty
not
paid
my
young
friend
consider
that
you
have
placed
me
under
an
obligation
to
you
for
life
this
money
is
only
an
expression
of
my
own
and
my
daughter
feelings
it
is
but
a
small
sum
but
i
hope
you
will
permit
me
to
do
something
more
for
you
when
you
need
it
you
will
regard
me
as
your
friend
as
long
as
you
live
thank
you
sir
when
you
want
any
assistance
of
any
kind
come
to
me
i
live
in
boston
here

my
business
card
bayard
handed
him
a
card
on
which
bobby
read
bayard
booksellers
and
publishers
no
washington
street
boston
you
are
very
kind

i
want
you

ellen
i

be
delighted
to
show
you
the
city
to
take
you
to
the
athenæum
and
the
museum
thank
you
bayard
inquired
of
bobby
about
his
parents
where
he
lived
and
about
the
circumstances
of
his
family
he
then
took
out
his
memorandum
book
in
which
he
wrote
the
boy
name
and
residence
i
am
sorry
to
leave
you
now
robert
but
i
have
over
twenty
miles
to
ride

should
be
glad
to
visit
your
mother
and
next
time
i
come
to
riverdale
i
shall
certainly
do
so
thank
you
sir
my
mother

a
very
poor
woman
but
she
will
be
glad
to
see
you
now
good
by
robert
good
by
repeated
ellen
good
by
bayard
drove
off
leaving
bobby
standing
on
the
bridge
with
the
gold
pieces
in
his
hand
here
luck
said
bobby
shaking
the
coin
wo
mother
eyes
stick
out
when
she
sees
these
shiners
there
are
no
such
shiners
in
the
river
as
these
bobby
was
astonished
and
the
more
he
gazed
at
the
gold
pieces
the
more
bewildered
he
became
he
had
never
held
so
much
money
in
his
hand
before
there
were
three
large
coins
and
one
smaller
one
he
turned
them
over
and
over
and
finally
ascertained
that
the
large
coins
were
ten
dollar
pieces
and
the
smaller
one
a
five
dollar
piece
bobby
was
not
a
great
scholar
but
he
knew
enough
of
arithmetic
to
calculate
the
value
of
his
treasure
he
was
so
excited
however
that
he
did
not
arrive
at
the
conclusion
half
so
quick
as
most
of
my
young
readers
would
have
done
dollars
exclaimed
bobby
when
the
problem
was
solved
gracious
hallo
bob
shouted
tom
spicer
who
had
got
tired
of
fishing
besides
the
village
clock
was
just
striking
twelve
and
it
was
time
for
him
to
go
home
bobby
made
no
answer
but
hastily
tying
the
gold
pieces
up
in
the
corner
of
his
handkerchief
he
threw
the
broken
rail
he
had
used
in
stopping
the
horse
where
it
belonged
and
started
for
the
place
where
he
had
left
his
fishing
apparatus
hallo
bob
well
tom
stopped
him
did
you
i
did
you
were
a
fool
he
might
have
killed
you
so
he
might
but
i
did
stop
to
think
of
that
the
lady
life
was
in
danger
what
of
that
everything
i
should
say
did
he
give
you
anything
yes
and
bobby
continued
his
walk
down
to
the
river
side
i
say
what
did
he
give
you
bobby
persisted
tom
following
him
o
he
gave
me
a
good
deal
of
money
how
much
i
want
to
get
my
fish
line
now
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
some
other
time
replied
bobby
who
rather
suspected
the
intentions
of
his
companion
tell
me
now
how
much
was
it
never
mind
it
now
humph
do
you
think
i
mean
to
rob
you
no
ai
you
going
halveses
why
should
i
was
i
with
you
were
you
was
i
fishing
with
you
you
did
not
do
anything
about
stopping
the
horse
i
would
if
i
had
been
afraid
to
go
up
to
the
road
afraid
somebody
might
have
seen
me
and
they
would
have
known
that
i
was
hooking
jack
then
you
ought
not
to
share
the
money
yes
i
had
when
a
fellow
is
with
you
he
ought
to
have
half
it
is
mean
not
to
give
him
half
if
you
had
done
anything
to
help
stop
the
horse
i
would
have
shared
with
you
but
you
did
what
of
that
bobby
was
particularly
sensitive
in
regard
to
the
charge
of
meanness
his
soul
was
a
great
deal
bigger
than
his
body
and
he
was
always
generous
even
to
his
own
injury
among
his
companions
it
was
evident
to
him
that
tom
had
no
claim
to
any
part
of
the
reward
but
he
could
not
endure
the
thought
even
of
being
accused
of
meanness
i
tell
you
what
i
will
do
if
you
think
i
ought
to
share
with
you
i
will
leave
it
out
to
squire
lee
and
if
he
thinks
you
ought
to
have
half
or
any
part
of
the
money
i
will
give
it
to
you
no
you
do
you
want
to
get
me
into
a
scrape
for
hooking
jack
i
see
what
you
are
up
to
i
will
state
the
case
to
him
without
telling
him
who
the
boys
are
no
you
do
you
want
to
be
mean
about
it
come
hand
over
half
the
money
i
will
not
replied
bobby
who
when
it
became
a
matter
of
compulsion
could
stand
his
ground
at
any
peril
how
much
have
you
got
dollars
by
jolly
and
you
mean
to
keep
it
all
yourself
i
mean
to
give
it
to
my
mother
no
you
wo
if
you
are
going
to
be
mean
about
it
i
smash
your
head
this
was
a
favorite
expression
with
tom
spicer
who
was
a
noted
bully
among
the
boys
of
riverdale
the
young
ruffian
now
placed
himself
in
front
of
bobby
and
shook
his
clenched
fist
in
his
face
hand
over
no
i
wo
you
have
no
claim
to
any
part
of
the
money
at
least
i
think
you
have
not
if
you
have
a
mind
to
leave
it
out
to
squire
lee
i
will
do
what
is
right
about
it
not
i
hand
over
or
i
smash
your
head
smash
away
replied
bobby
placing
himself
on
the
defensive
do
you
think
you
can
lick
me
asked
tom
not
a
little
embarrassed
by
this
exhibition
of
resolution
on
the
part
of
his
companion
i
do
think
anything
about
it
but
you
do
bully
me
in
that
kind
of
style
wo
i
no
but
tom
did
not
immediately
put
his
threat
in
execution
and
bobby
would
not
be
the
aggressor
so
he
stepped
one
side
to
pass
his
assailant
tom
took
this
as
an
evidence
of
the
other
desire
to
escape
and
struck
him
a
heavy
blow
on
the
side
of
the
head
the
next
instant
the
bully
was
floundering
in
the
soft
mud
of
a
ditch
reply
was
more
than
tom
had
bargained
for
and
while
he
was
dragging
himself
out
of
the
ditch
our
hero
ran
down
to
the
river
and
got
his
fish
pole
and
basket
you
catch
it
for
that
growled
tom
i
all
ready
whenever
it
suits
your
convenience
replied
bobby
just
come
out
here
and
take
it
in
fair
fight
continued
tom
who
could
not
help
bullying
even
in
the
midst
of
his
misfortune
no
i
thank
you
i
do
want
to
fight
with
any
fellow
i
will
not
fight
if
i
can
help
it
what
did
you
hit
me
for
then
in
just
come
out
here
and
try
it
fair
no
and
bobby
hurried
home
leaving
the
bully
astonished
and
discomfited
by
the
winding
up
of
the
morning
sport
chapter
iii
in
which
the
little
black
house
is
bought
but
not
paid
for
probably
my
young
readers
have
by
this
time
come
to
the
conclusion
that
bobby
bright
was
a
very
clever
fellow
one
whose
acquaintance
they
would
be
happy
to
cultivate
perhaps
by
this
time
they
have
become
so
far
interested
in
him
as
to
desire
to
know
who
his
parents
were
what
they
did
and
in
what
kind
of
a
house
he
lived
i
hope
none
of
my
young
friends
will
think
any
less
of
him
when
i
inform
them
that
bobby
lived
in
an
old
black
house
which
had
never
been
painted
which
had
no
flower
garden
in
front
of
it
and
which
in
a
word
was
quite
far
from
being
a
palace
a
great
many
very
nice
city
folks
would
not
have
considered
it
fit
to
live
in
would
have
turned
up
their
noses
at
it
and
wondered
that
any
human
beings
could
be
so
degraded
as
to
live
in
such
a
miserable
house
but
the
widow
bright
bobby
mother
thought
it
was
a
very
comfortable
house
and
considered
herself
very
fortunate
in
being
able
to
get
so
good
a
dwelling
she
had
never
lived
in
a
fine
house
knew
nothing
about
velvet
carpets
mirrors
seven
feet
high
damask
chairs
and
lounges
or
any
of
the
smart
things
which
very
rich
and
very
proud
city
people
consider
absolutely
necessary
for
their
comfort
her
father
had
been
a
poor
man
her
husband
had
died
a
poor
man
and
her
own
life
had
been
a
struggle
to
keep
the
demons
of
poverty
and
want
from
invading
her
humble
abode
mr
bright
her
deceased
husband
had
been
a
day
laborer
in
riverdale
he
never
got
more
than
a
dollar
a
day
which
was
then
considered
very
good
wages
in
the
country
he
was
a
very
honest
industrious
man
and
while
he
lived
his
family
did
very
well
mrs
bright
was
a
careful
prudent
woman
and
helped
him
support
the
family
they
never
knew
what
it
was
to
want
for
anything
poor
people
as
well
as
rich
have
an
ambition
to
be
something
which
they
are
not
or
to
have
something
which
they
have
not
every
person
who
has
any
energy
of
character
desires
to
get
ahead
in
the
world
some
merchants
who
own
big
ships
and
big
warehouses
by
the
dozen
desire
to
be
what
they
consider
rich
but
their
idea
of
wealth
is
very
grand
they
wish
to
count
it
in
millions
of
dollars
in
whole
blocks
of
warehouses
and
they
are
even
more
discontented
than
the
day
laborer
who
has
to
earn
his
dinner
before
he
can
eat
it
bobby
father
and
mother
had
just
such
an
ambition
only
it
was
so
modest
that
the
merchant
would
have
laughed
at
it
they
wanted
to
own
the
little
black
house
in
which
they
resided
so
that
they
could
not
only
be
sure
of
a
home
while
they
lived
but
have
the
satisfaction
of
living
in
their
own
house
this
was
a
very
reasonable
ideal
compared
with
that
of
the
rich
merchants
i
have
mentioned
but
it
was
even
more
difficult
for
them
to
reach
it
for
the
wages
were
small
and
they
had
many
mouths
to
feed
mr
bright
had
saved
up
fifty
dollars
and
he
thought
a
great
deal
more
of
this
sum
than
many
people
do
of
a
thousand
dollars
he
had
had
to
work
very
hard
and
be
very
prudent
in
order
to
accumulate
this
sum
which
made
him
value
it
all
the
more
highly
with
this
sum
of
fifty
dollars
at
his
command
john
bright
felt
rich
and
then
more
than
ever
before
he
wanted
to
own
the
little
black
house
he
felt
as
grand
as
a
lord
and
as
soon
as
the
dollars
had
become
fifty
he
waited
upon
hardhand
a
little
crusty
old
man
who
owned
the
little
black
house
and
proposed
to
purchase
it
the
landlord
was
a
hard
man
everybody
in
riverdale
said
he
was
mean
and
stingy
any
man
would
have
been
willing
to
make
an
easy
bargain
with
an
honest
industrious
poor
man
like
john
bright
who
wished
to
own
the
house
in
which
he
lived
but
hardhand
although
he
was
rich
only
thought
how
he
could
make
more
money
he
asked
the
poor
man
four
hundred
dollars
for
the
old
house
and
the
little
lot
of
land
on
which
it
stood
it
was
a
matter
of
great
concern
to
john
bright
four
hundred
dollars
was
a
mint
of
money
and
he
could
not
see
how
he
should
ever
be
able
to
save
so
much
from
his
daily
earnings
so
he
talked
with
squire
lee
about
it
who
told
him
that
three
hundred
was
all
it
was
worth
john
offered
this
for
it
and
after
a
month
hesitation
hardhand
accepted
the
offer
agreeing
to
take
fifty
dollars
down
and
the
rest
in
payments
of
dollars
each
until
the
whole
was
paid
i
am
thus
particular
in
telling
my
readers
about
the
bargain
because
this
debt
which
his
father
contracted
was
the
means
of
making
a
man
of
bobby
as
will
be
seen
in
his
subsequent
history
john
bright
paid
the
first
fifty
dollars
but
before
the
next
instalment
became
due
the
poor
man
was
laid
in
his
cold
and
silent
grave
a
malignant
disease
carried
him
off
and
the
hopes
of
the
bright
family
seemed
to
be
blasted
four
children
were
left
to
the
widow
the
youngest
was
only
three
years
old
and
bobby
the
oldest
was
nine
when
his
father
died
squire
lee
who
had
always
been
a
good
friend
of
john
bright
told
the
widow
that
she
had
better
go
to
the
poorhouse
and
not
attempt
to
struggle
along
with
such
fearful
odds
against
her
but
the
widow
nobly
refused
to
become
a
pauper
and
to
make
paupers
of
her
children
whom
she
loved
quite
as
much
as
though
she
and
they
had
been
born
in
a
ducal
palace
she
told
the
squire
that
she
had
two
hands
and
as
long
as
she
had
her
health
the
town
need
not
trouble
itself
about
her
support
squire
lee
was
filled
with
surprise
and
admiration
at
the
noble
resolution
of
the
poor
woman
and
when
he
returned
to
his
house
he
immediately
sent
her
a
cord
of
wood
ten
bushels
of
potatoes
two
bags
of
meal
and
a
firkin
of
salt
pork
the
widow
was
very
grateful
for
these
articles
and
no
false
pride
prevented
her
from
accepting
the
gift
of
her
rich
and
neighbor
riverdale
centre
was
largely
engaged
in
the
manufacturing
of
boots
and
shoes
and
this
business
gave
employment
to
a
large
number
of
men
and
women
mrs
bright
had
for
several
years
closed
shoes
which
my
readers
who
do
not
live
in
shoe
towns
may
not
know
means
sewing
or
stitching
them
to
this
business
she
applied
herself
with
renewed
energy
there
was
a
large
hotel
in
riverdale
centre
where
several
families
from
boston
spent
the
summer
by
the
aid
of
squire
lee
she
obtained
the
washing
of
these
families
which
was
more
profitable
than
closing
shoes
by
these
means
she
not
only
supported
her
family
very
comfortably
but
was
able
to
save
a
little
money
towards
paying
for
the
house
hardhand
by
the
persuasions
of
squire
lee
had
consented
to
let
the
widow
keep
the
house
and
pay
for
it
as
she
could
john
bright
had
been
dead
four
years
at
the
time
we
introduce
bobby
to
the
reader
mrs
bright
had
paid
another
hundred
dollars
towards
the
house
with
the
interest
so
there
was
now
but
one
hundred
due
bobby
had
learned
to
close
and
helped
his
mother
a
great
deal
but
the
confinement
and
the
stooping
posture
did
not
agree
with
his
health
and
his
mother
was
obliged
to
dispense
with
his
assistance
but
the
devoted
little
fellow
found
a
great
many
ways
of
helping
her
he
was
now
thirteen
and
was
as
handy
about
the
house
as
a
girl
when
he
was
not
better
occupied
he
would
often
go
to
the
river
and
catch
a
mess
of
fish
which
was
so
much
clear
gain
the
winter
which
had
just
passed
had
brought
a
great
deal
of
sickness
to
the
little
black
house
the
children
all
had
the
measles
and
two
of
them
the
scarlet
fever
so
that
mrs
bright
could
not
work
much
her
affairs
were
not
in
a
very
prosperous
condition
when
the
spring
opened
but
the
future
was
bright
and
the
widow
trusting
in
providence
believed
that
all
would
end
well
one
thing
troubled
her
she
had
not
been
able
to
save
anything
for
hardhand
she
could
only
pay
her
interest
but
she
hoped
by
the
first
of
july
to
give
him
dollars
of
the
principal
but
the
first
of
july
came
and
she
had
only
five
dollars
of
the
sum
she
had
partly
promised
her
creditor
she
could
not
so
easily
recover
from
the
disasters
of
the
hard
winter
and
she
had
but
just
paid
off
the
little
debts
she
had
contracted
she
was
nervous
and
uneasy
as
the
day
approached
hardhand
always
abused
her
when
she
told
him
she
could
not
pay
him
and
she
dreaded
his
coming
it
was
the
first
of
july
on
which
bobby
caught
those
pouts
caught
the
horse
and
on
which
tom
spicer
had
caught
a
tartar
bobby
hastened
home
as
we
said
at
the
conclusion
of
the
last
chapter
he
was
as
happy
as
a
lord
he
had
fish
enough
in
his
basket
for
dinner
and
for
breakfast
the
next
morning
and
money
enough
in
his
pocket
to
make
his
mother
as
happy
as
a
queen
if
queens
are
always
happy
the
widow
bright
though
she
had
worried
and
fretted
night
and
day
about
the
money
which
was
to
be
paid
to
hardhand
on
the
first
of
july
had
not
told
her
son
anything
about
it
it
would
only
make
him
unhappy
she
reasoned
and
it
was
needless
to
make
the
dear
boy
miserable
for
nothing
so
bobby
ran
home
all
unconscious
of
the
pleasure
which
was
in
store
for
him
when
he
reached
the
front
door
as
he
stopped
to
scrape
his
feet
on
the
sharp
stone
there
as
all
considerate
boys
who
love
their
mothers
do
before
they
go
into
the
house
he
heard
the
angry
tones
of
hardhand
he
was
scolding
and
abusing
his
mother
because
she
could
not
pay
him
the
dollars
bobby
blood
boiled
with
indignation
and
his
first
impulse
was
to
serve
him
as
he
had
served
tom
spicer
only
a
few
moments
before
but
bobby
as
we
have
before
intimated
was
a
peaceful
boy
and
not
disposed
to
quarrel
with
any
person
so
he
contented
himself
with
muttering
a
few
hard
words
the
wretch
what
business
has
he
to
talk
to
mother
in
that
style
said
he
to
himself
i
have
a
great
mind
to
kick
him
out
of
the
house
but
bobby
better
judgment
came
to
his
aid
and
perhaps
he
realized
that
he
and
his
mother
would
only
get
kicked
out
in
return
he
could
battle
with
hardhand
but
not
with
the
power
which
his
wealth
gave
him
so
like
a
great
many
older
persons
in
similar
circumstances
he
took
counsel
of
prudence
rather
than
impulse
bear
ye
one
another
burdens
saith
the
scripture
but
bobby
was
not
old
enough
or
astute
enough
to
realize
that
hardhand
burden
was
his
wealth
his
love
of
money
that
it
made
him
little
better
than
a
hottentot
and
he
could
not
feel
as
charitably
towards
him
as
a
christian
should
towards
his
erring
weak
brother
setting
his
pole
by
the
door
he
entered
the
room
where
hardhand
was
abusing
his
mother
chapter
iv
in
which
bobby
gets
out
of
one
scrape
and
into
another
bobby
was
so
indignant
at
the
conduct
of
hardhand
that
he
entirely
forgot
the
adventure
of
the
morning
and
he
did
not
even
think
of
the
gold
he
had
in
his
pocket
he
loved
his
mother
he
knew
how
hard
she
had
worked
for
him
and
his
brother
and
sisters
that
she
had
burned
the
midnight
oil
at
her
clamps
and
it
made
him
feel
very
bad
to
hear
her
abused
as
hardhand
was
abusing
her
it
was
not
her
fault
that
she
had
not
the
money
to
pay
him
she
had
been
obliged
to
spend
a
large
portion
of
her
time
over
the
sick
beds
of
her
children
so
that
she
could
not
earn
so
much
money
as
usual
while
the
family
expenses
were
necessarily
much
greater
bobby
knew
also
that
hardhand
was
aware
of
all
the
circumstances
of
his
mother
position
and
the
more
he
considered
the
case
the
more
brutal
and
inhuman
was
his
course
as
our
hero
entered
the
family
room
with
the
basket
of
fish
on
his
arm
the
little
crusty
old
man
fixed
the
glance
of
his
evil
eye
upon
him
there
is
that
boy
marm
idling
away
his
time
by
the
river
and
eating
you
out
of
house
and
home
said
the
wretch
why
do
you
set
him
to
work
and
make
him
earn
something
bobby
is
a
very
good
boy
meekly
responded
the
widow
bright
humph
i
should
think
he
was
a
great
lazy
lubber
like
him
living
on
his
mother
and
hardhand
looked
contemptuously
at
bobby
i
am
not
a
lazy
lubber
interposed
the
insulted
boy
with
spirit
yes
you
are
why
do
you
go
to
work
i
do
work
no
you
do
you
waste
your
time
paddling
in
the
river
i
do
you
had
better
teach
this
boy
manners
too
marm
said
the
creditor
who
like
all
men
of
small
souls
was
willing
to
take
advantage
of
the
power
which
the
widow
indebtedness
gave
him
he
is
saucy
i
should
like
to
know
who
taught
manners
hardhand
replied
bobby
whose
indignation
was
rapidly
getting
the
better
of
his
discretion
what
growled
hardhand
aghast
at
this
unwonted
boldness
i
heard
what
you
said
before
i
came
in
and
no
decent
man
would
go
to
the
house
of
a
poor
woman
to
insult
her
humph
mighty
fine
snarled
the
little
old
man
his
gray
eyes
twinkling
with
malice
do
bobby
do
be
saucy
to
the
gentleman
interposed
his
mother
saucy
marm
you
ought
to
horsewhip
him
for
it
if
you
do
i
will
no
you
wo
replied
bobby
shaking
his
head
significantly
i
can
take
care
of
myself
did
any
one
ever
hear
such
impudence
gasped
hardhand
do
bobby
do
pleaded
the
anxious
mother
i
should
like
to
know
what
right
you
have
to
come
here
and
abuse
my
mother
continued
bobby
who
could
not
restrain
his
anger
your
mother
owes
me
money
and
she
does
pay
it
you
young
scoundrel
answered
hardhand
foaming
with
rage
that
is
no
reason
why
you
should
insult
her
you
can
call
what
you
please
but
you
shall
not
insult
my
mother
while
i
round
your
mother
is
a
miserable
woman
and
say
that
again
and
though
you
are
an
old
man
i
hit
you
for
it
i
big
enough
to
protect
my
mother
and
i
do
it
bobby
doubled
up
his
fists
and
edged
up
to
hardhand
fully
determined
to
execute
his
threat
if
he
repeated
the
offensive
expression
or
any
other
of
a
similar
import
he
was
roused
to
the
highest
pitch
of
anger
and
felt
as
though
he
had
just
as
lief
die
as
live
in
defence
of
his
mother
good
name
i
am
not
sure
that
i
could
excuse
bobby
violence
under
any
other
circumstances
he
loved
his
mother
as
the
novelists
would
say
he
idolized
her
and
hardhand
had
certainly
applied
some
very
offensive
epithets
to
her
epithets
which
no
good
son
could
calmly
hear
applied
to
a
mother
besides
bobby
though
his
heart
was
a
large
one
and
was
in
the
right
place
had
never
been
educated
into
those
nice
distinctions
of
moral
right
and
wrong
which
control
the
judgment
of
wise
and
learned
men
he
had
an
idea
that
violence
resistance
with
blows
was
allowable
in
certain
extreme
cases
and
he
could
conceive
of
no
greater
provocation
than
an
insult
to
his
mother
be
calm
bobby
you
are
in
a
passion
said
mrs
bright
i
am
surprised
marm
began
hardhand
who
prudently
refrained
from
repeating
the
offensive
language
and
i
have
no
doubt
he
was
surprised
for
he
looked
both
astonished
and
alarmed
this
boy
has
a
most
ungovernable
temper
do
you
worry
about
my
temper
hardhand
i
take
care
of
myself
all
i
want
of
you
is
not
to
insult
my
mother
you
may
say
what
you
like
to
me
but
do
you
call
her
hard
names
hardhand
like
all
mean
little
men
was
a
coward
and
he
was
effectually
intimidated
by
the
bold
and
manly
conduct
of
the
boy
he
changed
his
tone
and
manner
at
once
you
have
no
money
for
me
marm
said
he
edging
towards
the
door
no
sir
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
i
have
been
able
to
save
only
five
dollars
since
i
paid
you
last
but
i
hope
never
mind
marm
never
mind
i
shall
not
trouble
myself
to
come
here
again
where
i
am
liable
to
be
kicked
by
this
cub
no
marm
i
shall
not
come
again
let
the
law
take
its
course
o
mercy
see
what
you
have
brought
upon
us
bobby
exclaimed
mrs
bright
bursting
into
tears
yes
marm
let
the
law
take
its
course
o
bobby
stop
a
moment
hardhand
do
stop
a
moment
not
a
moment
marm
we
see
and
hardhand
placed
his
hand
upon
the
latch
string
bobby
felt
very
uneasy
and
very
unhappy
at
that
moment
his
passion
had
subsided
and
he
realized
that
he
had
done
a
great
deal
of
mischief
by
his
impetuous
conduct
then
the
remembrance
of
his
morning
adventure
on
the
bridge
came
like
a
flash
of
sunshine
to
his
mind
and
he
eagerly
drew
from
his
pocket
the
handkerchief
in
which
he
had
deposited
the
precious
gold
doubly
precious
now
because
it
would
enable
him
to
retrieve
the
error
into
which
he
had
fallen
and
do
something
towards
relieving
his
embarrassment
with
a
trembling
hand
he
untied
the
knot
which
secured
the
money
here
mother
here
is
dollars
and
he
placed
it
in
her
hand
why
bobby
exclaimed
mrs
bright
pay
him
mother
pay
him
and
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
by
and
by
dollars
and
all
in
gold
where
you
get
it
bobby
never
mind
it
now
mother
hardhand
covetous
soul
had
already
grasped
the
glittering
gold
and
removing
his
hand
from
the
latch
string
he
approached
the
widow
i
shall
be
able
to
pay
you
forty
dollars
now
said
mrs
bright
taking
the
five
dollars
she
had
saved
from
her
pocket
yes
marm
hardhand
took
the
money
and
seating
himself
at
the
table
indorsed
the
amount
on
the
back
of
the
note
you
owe
me
sixty
more
said
he
maliciously
as
he
returned
the
note
to
his
pocket
book
it
must
be
paid
immediately
you
must
not
be
hard
with
me
now
when
i
have
paid
more
than
you
demanded
i
do
wish
to
come
here
again
that
boy
impudence
has
put
me
all
out
of
conceit
with
you
and
your
family
replied
hardhand
assuming
the
most
benevolent
look
he
could
command
there
was
a
time
when
i
was
very
willing
to
help
you
i
have
waited
a
great
while
for
my
pay
for
this
house
a
great
deal
longer
than
i
would
have
waited
for
anybody
else
your
interest
has
always
been
paid
punctually
suggested
the
widow
modestly
that
true
but
very
few
people
would
have
waited
as
long
as
i
have
for
the
principal
i
wanted
to
help
you
by
gracious
exclaimed
bobby
interrupting
him
do
be
saucy
my
son
do
said
mrs
bright
fearing
a
repetition
of
the
former
scene
wanted
to
help
us
ejaculated
bobby
it
was
a
very
absurd
and
hypocritical
expression
on
the
part
of
hardhand
for
he
never
wanted
to
help
any
one
but
himself
and
during
the
whole
period
of
his
relations
with
the
poor
widow
he
had
oppressed
insulted
and
abused
her
to
the
extent
of
his
capacity
or
at
least
as
far
as
his
interest
would
permit
he
was
a
malicious
and
revengeful
man
he
did
not
consider
the
great
provocation
he
had
given
bobby
for
his
violent
conduct
but
determined
to
be
revenged
if
it
could
be
accomplished
without
losing
any
part
of
the
sixty
dollars
still
due
him
he
was
a
wicked
man
at
heart
and
would
not
scruple
to
turn
the
widow
and
her
family
out
of
house
and
home
mrs
bright
knew
this
and
bobby
knew
it
too
and
they
felt
very
uneasy
about
it
the
wretch
still
had
the
power
to
injure
them
and
he
would
use
it
without
compunction
yes
young
man
i
wanted
to
help
you
and
you
see
what
i
get
for
it
contempt
and
insults
you
will
hear
from
me
again
in
a
day
or
two
perhaps
you
will
change
your
tune
you
young
reprobate
perhaps
i
shall
replied
bobby
without
much
discretion
and
you
too
marm
you
uphold
him
in
his
treatment
of
me
you
have
not
done
your
duty
to
him
you
have
been
remiss
marm
continued
hardhand
growing
bolder
again
as
he
felt
the
power
he
wielded
that
will
do
sir
you
can
go
said
bobby
springing
from
his
chair
and
approaching
hardhand
go
and
do
your
worst
humph
you
stump
me
do
you
i
would
rather
see
my
mother
kicked
out
of
the
house
than
insulted
by
such
a
old
curmudgeon
as
you
are
go
along
now
do
bobby
pleaded
his
mother
i
am
going
and
if
the
money
is
not
paid
by
twelve
the
law
shall
take
its
course
and
hardhand
rushed
out
of
the
house
slamming
the
door
violently
after
him
o
bobby
what
have
you
done
exclaimed
mrs
bright
when
the
creditor
had
departed
i
could
not
help
it
mother
do
cry
i
can
not
bear
to
hear
you
insulted
and
abused
and
i
thought
when
i
heard
him
do
it
a
year
ago
that
i
could
stand
it
again
it
is
too
bad
but
he
will
turn
us
out
of
the
house
and
what
shall
we
do
then
do
cry
mother
it
will
come
round
all
right
i
have
friends
who
are
rich
and
powerful
and
who
will
help
us
you
do
know
what
you
say
bobby
sixty
dollars
is
a
great
deal
of
money
and
if
we
should
sell
all
we
have
it
would
scarcely
bring
that
leave
it
all
to
me
mother
i
feel
as
though
i
could
do
something
now
i
am
old
enough
to
make
money
what
can
you
do
now
or
never
replied
bobby
whose
mind
had
wandered
from
the
scene
to
the
busy
world
where
fortunes
are
made
and
lost
every
day
now
or
never
muttered
he
again
but
bobby
you
have
not
told
me
where
you
got
all
that
gold
dinner
is
ready
i
see
and
i
will
tell
you
while
we
eat
bobby
had
been
a
fishing
and
to
be
hungry
is
a
part
of
the
fisherman
luck
so
he
seated
himself
at
the
table
and
gave
his
mother
a
full
account
of
all
that
had
occurred
at
the
bridge
the
fond
mother
trembled
when
she
realized
the
peril
her
son
had
incurred
for
the
sake
of
the
young
lady
but
her
maternal
heart
swelled
with
admiration
in
view
of
the
generous
deed
and
she
thanked
god
that
she
was
the
mother
of
such
a
son
she
felt
more
confidence
in
him
then
than
she
had
ever
felt
before
and
she
realized
that
he
would
be
the
stay
and
the
staff
of
her
declining
years
bobby
finished
his
dinner
and
seated
himself
on
the
front
door
step
his
mind
was
absorbed
by
a
new
and
brilliant
idea
and
for
half
an
hour
he
kept
up
a
most
tremendous
thinking
now
or
never
said
he
as
he
rose
and
walked
down
the
road
towards
riverdale
centre
chapter
v
in
which
bobby
gives
his
note
for
sixty
dollars
a
great
idea
was
born
in
bobby
brain
his
mother
weakness
and
the
insecurity
of
her
position
were
more
apparent
to
him
than
they
had
ever
been
before
she
was
in
the
power
of
her
creditor
who
might
turn
her
out
of
the
little
black
house
sell
the
place
at
auction
and
thus
perhaps
deprive
her
of
the
whole
or
a
large
part
of
his
father
and
her
own
hard
earnings
but
this
was
not
the
peculiar
hardship
of
her
situation
as
her
devoted
son
understood
it
it
was
not
the
hard
work
alone
which
she
was
called
upon
to
perform
not
the
coarseness
of
the
fare
upon
which
they
lived
not
the
danger
even
of
being
turned
out
of
doors
that
distressed
bobby
it
was
that
a
wretch
like
hardhand
could
insult
and
trample
upon
his
mother
he
had
just
heard
him
use
language
to
her
that
made
his
blood
boil
with
indignation
and
he
did
not
on
cool
sober
second
thought
regret
that
he
had
taken
such
a
decided
stand
against
it
he
cared
not
for
himself
he
could
live
on
a
crust
of
bread
and
a
cup
of
water
from
the
spring
he
could
sleep
in
a
barn
he
could
wear
coarse
and
even
ragged
clothes
but
he
could
not
submit
to
have
his
mother
insulted
and
by
such
a
mean
and
contemptible
person
as
hardhand
yet
what
could
he
do
he
was
but
a
boy
and
the
great
world
would
look
with
contempt
upon
his
puny
form
but
he
felt
that
he
was
not
altogether
insignificant
he
had
performed
an
act
that
day
which
the
fair
young
lady
to
whom
he
had
rendered
the
service
had
declared
very
few
men
would
have
undertaken
there
was
something
in
him
something
that
would
come
out
if
he
only
put
his
best
foot
forward
it
was
a
tower
of
strength
within
him
it
told
him
that
he
could
do
wonders
that
he
could
go
out
into
the
world
and
accomplish
all
that
would
be
required
to
free
his
mother
from
debt
and
relieve
her
from
the
severe
drudgery
of
her
life
a
great
many
people
think
they
can
do
wonders
the
vanity
of
some
very
silly
people
makes
them
think
they
can
command
armies
govern
nations
and
teach
the
world
what
the
world
never
knew
before
and
never
would
know
but
for
them
but
bobby
something
within
him
was
not
vanity
it
was
something
more
substantial
he
was
not
thinking
of
becoming
a
great
man
a
great
general
a
great
ruler
or
a
great
statesman
not
even
of
making
a
great
fortune
self
was
not
the
idol
and
the
end
of
his
calculations
he
was
thinking
of
his
mother
and
only
of
her
and
the
feeling
within
him
was
as
pure
and
holy
and
beautiful
as
the
dream
of
an
angel
he
wanted
to
save
his
mother
from
insult
in
the
first
place
and
from
a
life
of
ceaseless
drudgery
in
the
second
a
legion
of
angels
seemed
to
have
encamped
in
his
soul
to
give
him
strength
for
the
great
purpose
in
his
mind
his
was
a
holy
and
a
true
purpose
and
it
was
this
that
made
him
think
he
could
do
wonders
what
bobby
intended
to
do
the
reader
shall
know
in
due
time
it
is
enough
now
that
he
meant
to
do
something
the
difficulty
with
a
great
many
people
is
that
they
never
resolve
to
do
something
they
wait
for
something
to
turn
up
and
as
things
are
often
very
obstinate
they
utterly
refuse
to
turn
up
at
all
their
lives
are
spent
in
waiting
for
a
golden
opportunity
which
never
comes
now
bobby
bright
repudiated
the
micawber
philosophy
he
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
he
did
not
believe
corn
would
grow
without
being
planted
or
that
pouts
would
bite
the
bare
hook
i
am
not
going
to
tell
my
young
readers
now
how
bobby
came
out
in
the
end
but
i
can
confidently
say
that
if
he
had
waited
for
something
to
turn
up
he
would
have
become
a
vagabond
a
loafer
out
of
money
out
at
the
elbows
and
out
of
patience
with
himself
and
all
the
world
it
was
now
or
never
with
bobby
he
meant
to
do
something
and
after
he
had
made
up
his
mind
how
and
where
it
was
to
be
done
it
was
no
use
to
stand
thinking
about
it
like
the
pendulum
of
the
old
clock
which
had
stood
for
fifty
years
in
a
farmer
kitchen
without
giving
its
owner
any
cause
of
complaint
bobby
walked
down
the
road
towards
the
village
with
a
rapid
step
he
was
thinking
very
fast
and
probably
that
made
him
step
quick
but
as
he
approached
squire
lee
house
his
pace
slackened
and
he
seemed
to
be
very
uneasy
when
he
reached
the
great
gate
that
led
up
to
the
house
he
stopped
for
an
instant
and
thrust
his
hands
down
very
deep
into
his
trousers
pockets
i
can
not
tell
what
the
trousers
pockets
had
to
do
with
what
he
was
thinking
about
but
if
he
was
searching
for
anything
in
them
he
did
not
find
it
for
after
an
hesitation
he
drew
out
his
hands
struck
one
of
them
against
his
chest
and
in
an
audible
voice
exclaimed
now
or
never
all
this
pantomime
i
suppose
meant
that
bobby
had
some
misgivings
as
to
the
ultimate
success
of
his
mission
at
squire
lee
and
that
when
he
struck
his
breast
and
uttered
his
favorite
expression
they
were
conquered
and
driven
out
marching
with
a
bold
and
determined
step
up
to
the
squire
back
door
bobby
ideas
of
etiquette
would
not
have
answered
for
the
meridian
of
fashionable
society
he
gave
three
smart
raps
bobby
heart
beat
a
little
wildly
as
he
awaited
a
response
to
his
summons
it
seemed
that
he
still
had
some
doubts
as
to
the
practicability
of
his
mission
but
they
were
not
permitted
to
disturb
him
long
for
the
door
was
opened
by
the
squire
pretty
daughter
annie
a
young
miss
of
twelve
o
bobby
is
it
you
i
am
so
glad
you
have
come
exclaimed
the
little
lady
bobby
blushed
he
did
know
why
unless
it
was
that
the
young
lady
desired
to
see
him
he
stammered
out
a
reply
and
for
the
moment
forgot
the
object
of
his
visit
i
want
you
to
go
down
to
the
village
for
me
and
get
some
books
the
expressman
was
to
bring
up
from
boston
for
me
will
you
go
certainly
miss
annie
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
go
for
replied
bobby
with
an
emphasis
that
made
the
little
maiden
blush
in
her
turn
you
are
real
good
bobby
but
i
will
give
you
something
for
going
i
do
want
anything
said
bobby
stoutly
you
are
too
generous
ah
i
heard
what
you
did
this
forenoon
and
pa
says
that
a
great
many
men
would
not
have
dared
to
do
what
you
did
i
always
thought
you
were
as
brave
as
a
lion
now
i
know
it
the
books
are
at
the
express
office
i
suppose
said
bobby
turning
as
red
as
a
blood
beet
yes
bobby
i
am
so
anxious
to
get
them
that
i
ca
wait
till
pa
goes
down
this
evening
i
will
not
be
gone
long
o
you
need
run
bobby
take
your
time
i
will
go
very
quick
but
miss
annie
is
your
father
at
home
not
now
he
has
gone
over
to
the
wood
lot
but
he
will
be
back
by
the
time
you
return
will
you
please
to
tell
him
that
i
want
to
see
him
about
something
very
particular
when
he
gets
back
i
will
bobby
thank
you
miss
annie
and
bobby
hastened
to
the
village
to
execute
his
commission
i
wonder
what
he
wants
to
see
pa
so
very
particularly
for
said
the
young
lady
to
herself
as
she
watched
his
receding
form
in
my
opinion
something
has
happened
at
the
little
black
house
for
i
could
see
that
he
looked
very
sober
either
bobby
had
a
very
great
regard
for
the
young
lady
and
wished
to
relieve
her
impatience
to
behold
the
coveted
books
or
he
was
in
a
hurry
to
see
squire
lee
for
the
squire
old
roan
horse
could
hardly
have
gone
quicker
you
should
not
have
run
bobby
said
the
little
maiden
when
he
placed
the
books
in
her
hand
i
would
not
have
asked
you
to
go
if
i
had
thought
you
would
run
all
the
way
you
must
be
very
tired
not
at
all
i
did
run
only
walked
very
quick
replied
he
but
his
quick
breathing
indicated
that
his
words
or
his
walk
had
been
very
much
exaggerated
has
your
father
returned
he
has
he
is
waiting
for
you
in
the
sitting
room
come
in
bobby
bobby
followed
her
into
the
room
and
took
the
chair
which
annie
offered
him
how
do
you
do
bobby
i
am
glad
to
see
you
said
the
squire
taking
him
by
the
hand
and
bestowing
a
benignant
smile
upon
him
a
smile
which
cheered
his
heart
more
than
anything
else
could
at
that
moment
i
have
heard
of
you
before
have
you
i
have
bobby
you
are
a
brave
little
fellow
i
came
over
to
see
you
sir
about
something
very
particular
replied
bobby
whose
natural
modesty
induced
him
to
change
the
topic
indeed
well
what
can
i
do
for
you
a
great
deal
sir
perhaps
you
will
think
i
am
very
bold
sir
but
i
ca
help
it
i
know
you
are
a
very
bold
little
fellow
or
you
would
not
have
done
what
you
did
this
forenoon
laughed
the
squire
i
did
mean
that
sir
answered
bobby
blushing
up
to
the
eyes
i
know
you
did
but
go
on
i
only
meant
that
you
would
think
me
presuming
or
impudent
or
something
of
that
kind
o
no
far
from
it
you
can
not
be
presuming
or
impudent
speak
out
bobby
anything
under
the
heavens
that
i
can
do
for
you
i
shall
be
glad
to
do
well
sir
i
am
going
to
leave
riverdale
leave
riverdale
yes
sir
i
am
going
to
boston
where
i
mean
to
do
something
to
help
mother
bravo
you
are
a
good
lad
what
do
you
mean
to
do
i
was
thinking
i
should
go
into
the
book
business
indeed
and
squire
lee
was
much
amused
by
the
manner
of
the
young
aspirant
i
was
talking
with
a
young
fellow
who
went
through
the
place
last
spring
selling
books
he
told
me
that
some
days
he
made
three
or
four
dollars
and
that
he
averaged
twelve
dollars
a
week
he
did
well
perhaps
though
only
a
few
of
them
make
so
much
i
know
i
can
make
twelve
dollars
a
week
replied
bobby
confidently
for
that
something
within
him
made
him
feel
capable
of
great
things
i
dare
say
you
can
you
have
energy
and
perseverance
and
people
take
a
liking
to
you
but
i
wanted
to
see
you
about
another
matter
to
speak
out
at
once
i
want
to
borrow
sixty
dollars
of
you
and
bobby
blushed
and
seemed
very
much
embarrassed
by
his
own
boldness
sixty
dollars
exclaimed
the
squire
i
knew
you
would
think
me
impudent
replied
our
hero
his
heart
sinking
within
him
but
i
do
bobby
you
want
the
money
to
go
into
business
with
to
buy
your
stock
of
books
o
no
sir
i
am
going
to
apply
to
bayard
for
that
just
so
bayard
is
the
gentleman
whose
daughter
you
saved
yes
sir
i
want
this
money
to
pay
off
hardhand
we
owe
him
but
sixty
dollars
now
and
he
has
threatened
to
turn
us
out
if
it
is
not
paid
by
noon
the
old
hunks
bobby
briefly
related
to
the
squire
the
events
of
the
morning
much
to
the
indignation
and
disgust
of
the
honest
man
the
courageous
boy
detailed
more
clearly
his
purpose
and
doubted
not
he
should
be
able
to
pay
the
loan
in
a
few
months
very
well
bobby
here
is
the
money
and
the
squire
took
it
from
his
wallet
and
gave
it
to
him
thank
you
sir
may
heaven
bless
you
i
shall
certainly
pay
you
do
worry
about
it
bobby
pay
it
when
you
get
ready
i
will
give
you
my
note
and
the
squire
laughed
heartily
at
this
and
told
him
that
as
he
was
a
minor
his
note
was
not
good
for
anything
you
shall
see
whether
it
is
or
not
returned
bobby
let
me
give
it
to
you
at
least
so
that
we
can
tell
how
much
i
owe
you
from
time
to
time
you
shall
have
your
own
way
annie
lee
as
much
amused
as
her
father
at
bobby
big
talk
got
the
writing
materials
and
the
little
merchant
in
embryo
wrote
and
signed
the
note
good
bobby
now
promise
that
you
will
come
and
see
me
every
time
you
come
home
and
tell
me
how
you
are
getting
along
i
will
sir
with
the
greatest
pleasure
and
with
a
light
heart
bobby
tripped
away
home
chapter
vi
in
which
bobby
sets
out
on
his
travels
squire
lee
though
only
a
plain
farmer
was
the
richest
man
in
riverdale
he
had
taken
a
great
fancy
to
bobby
and
often
employed
him
to
do
errands
ride
the
horse
to
plough
in
the
cornfields
and
such
chores
about
the
place
as
a
boy
could
do
he
liked
to
talk
with
bobby
because
there
was
a
great
deal
of
good
sense
in
him
for
one
with
a
small
head
if
there
was
any
one
thing
upon
which
the
squire
particularly
prided
himself
it
was
his
knowledge
of
human
nature
he
declared
that
he
only
wanted
to
look
a
man
in
the
face
to
know
what
he
was
and
as
for
bobby
bright
he
had
summered
him
and
wintered
him
and
he
was
satisfied
that
he
would
make
something
in
good
time
he
was
not
much
astonished
when
bobby
opened
his
ambitious
scheme
of
going
into
business
for
himself
but
he
had
full
faith
in
his
ability
to
work
out
a
useful
and
profitable
if
not
a
brilliant
life
he
often
said
that
bobby
was
worth
his
weight
in
gold
and
that
he
would
trust
him
with
anything
he
had
perhaps
he
did
not
suspect
that
the
time
was
at
hand
when
he
would
be
called
upon
to
verify
his
words
practically
for
it
was
only
that
morning
when
one
of
the
neighbors
told
him
about
bobby
stopping
the
horse
that
he
had
repeated
the
expression
for
the
twentieth
time
it
was
not
an
idle
remark
sixty
dollars
was
hardly
worth
mentioning
with
a
man
of
his
wealth
and
liberal
views
though
so
careful
a
man
as
he
was
would
not
have
been
likely
to
throw
away
that
amount
but
as
a
matter
of
investment
bobby
had
made
the
note
read
with
interest
he
would
as
readily
have
let
him
have
it
as
the
next
richest
man
in
the
place
so
much
confidence
had
he
in
our
integrity
and
so
sure
was
he
that
he
would
soon
have
the
means
of
paying
him
bobby
was
overjoyed
at
the
fortunate
issue
of
his
mission
and
he
walked
into
the
room
where
his
mother
was
closing
shoes
with
a
dignity
worthy
a
banker
or
a
great
merchant
mrs
bright
was
very
sad
perhaps
she
felt
a
little
grieved
that
her
son
whom
she
loved
so
much
had
so
thoughtlessly
plunged
her
into
a
new
difficulty
come
cheer
up
mother
it
is
all
right
said
bobby
in
his
usual
elastic
and
gay
tones
and
at
the
same
time
he
took
the
sixty
dollars
from
his
pocket
and
handed
it
to
her
there
is
the
money
and
you
will
be
forever
quit
of
hardhand
what
bobby
why
where
did
you
get
all
this
money
asked
mrs
bright
utterly
astonished
in
a
few
words
the
ambitious
boy
told
his
story
and
then
informed
his
mother
that
he
was
going
to
boston
the
next
monday
morning
to
commence
business
for
himself
why
what
can
you
do
bobby
do
i
can
do
a
great
many
things
and
he
unfolded
his
scheme
of
becoming
a
little
book
merchant
you
are
a
courageous
fellow
who
would
have
thought
of
such
a
thing
i
should
and
did
but
you
are
not
old
enough
o
yes
i
am
you
had
better
wait
a
while
now
or
never
mother
you
see
i
have
given
my
note
and
my
paper
will
be
dishonored
if
i
am
not
up
and
doing
your
paper
said
mrs
bright
with
a
smile
that
is
what
wing
the
boot
manufacturer
calls
it
you
need
go
away
to
earn
this
money
i
can
pay
it
myself
this
note
is
my
affair
and
i
mean
to
pay
it
myself
with
my
own
earnings
no
objections
mother
like
a
sensible
woman
as
she
was
she
did
not
make
any
objections
she
was
conscious
of
bobby
talents
she
knew
that
he
had
a
strong
mind
of
his
own
and
could
take
care
of
himself
it
is
true
she
feared
the
influence
of
the
great
world
and
especially
of
the
great
city
upon
the
tender
mind
of
her
son
but
if
he
was
never
tempted
he
would
never
be
a
conqueror
over
the
foes
that
beset
him
she
determined
to
do
her
whole
duty
towards
him
and
she
carefully
pointed
out
to
him
the
sins
and
the
moral
danger
to
which
he
would
be
exposed
and
warned
him
always
to
resist
temptation
she
counselled
him
to
think
of
her
when
he
felt
like
going
astray
bobby
declared
that
he
would
try
to
be
a
good
boy
he
did
not
speak
contemptuously
of
the
anticipated
perils
as
many
boys
would
have
done
because
he
knew
that
his
mother
would
not
make
out
of
things
which
she
knew
had
no
real
existence
the
next
day
hardhand
came
and
my
young
readers
can
judge
how
astonished
and
chagrined
he
was
when
the
widow
bright
offered
him
the
sixty
dollars
the
lord
was
with
the
widow
and
the
fatherless
and
the
wretch
was
cheated
out
of
his
revenge
the
note
was
given
up
and
the
mortgage
cancelled
hardhand
insisted
that
she
should
pay
the
interest
on
the
sixty
dollars
for
one
day
as
it
was
then
the
second
day
of
july
but
when
bobby
reckoned
it
up
and
found
it
was
less
than
one
cent
even
the
wretched
miser
seemed
ashamed
of
himself
and
changed
the
subject
of
conversation
he
did
not
dare
to
say
anything
saucy
to
the
widow
this
time
he
had
lost
his
power
over
her
and
there
stood
bobby
who
had
come
to
look
just
like
a
young
lion
to
him
coward
and
knave
as
he
was
the
business
was
all
settled
now
and
bobby
spent
the
rest
of
the
week
in
getting
ready
for
his
great
enterprise
he
visited
all
his
friends
and
went
each
day
to
talk
with
squire
lee
and
annie
the
little
maiden
promised
to
buy
a
great
many
books
of
him
if
he
would
bring
his
stock
to
riverdale
for
she
was
quite
as
much
interested
in
him
as
her
father
was
monday
morning
came
and
bobby
was
out
of
bed
with
the
first
streak
of
dawn
the
excitement
of
the
great
event
which
was
about
to
happen
had
not
permitted
him
to
sleep
for
the
two
hours
preceding
yet
when
he
got
up
he
could
not
help
feeling
sad
he
was
going
to
leave
the
little
black
house
going
to
leave
his
mother
going
to
leave
the
children
to
depart
for
the
great
city
his
mother
was
up
before
him
she
was
even
more
sad
than
he
was
for
she
could
see
plainer
than
he
the
perils
that
environed
him
and
her
maternal
heart
in
spite
of
the
reasonable
confidence
she
had
in
his
integrity
and
good
principles
trembled
for
his
safety
as
he
ate
his
breakfast
his
mother
repeated
the
warnings
and
the
good
lessons
she
had
before
imparted
she
particularly
cautioned
him
to
keep
out
of
bad
company
if
he
found
that
his
companions
would
lie
and
swear
he
might
depend
upon
it
they
would
steal
and
he
had
better
forsake
them
at
once
this
was
excellent
advice
and
bobby
had
occasion
at
a
later
period
to
call
it
to
his
sorrowing
heart
here
is
three
dollars
bobby
it
is
all
the
money
i
have
your
fare
to
boston
will
be
one
dollar
and
you
will
have
two
left
to
pay
the
expenses
of
your
first
trip
it
is
all
i
have
now
said
mrs
bright
i
will
not
take
the
whole
of
it
you
will
want
it
yourself
one
dollar
is
enough
when
i
find
bayard
i
shall
do
very
well
yes
bobby
take
the
whole
of
it
i
will
take
just
one
dollar
and
no
more
replied
bobby
resolutely
as
he
handed
her
the
other
two
dollars
do
take
it
bobby
no
mother
it
will
only
make
me
lazy
and
indifferent
taking
a
clean
shirt
a
pair
of
socks
and
a
handkerchief
in
his
bundle
he
was
ready
for
a
start
good
by
mother
said
he
kissing
her
and
taking
her
hand
i
shall
try
and
come
home
on
saturday
so
as
to
be
with
you
on
sunday
then
kissing
the
children
who
had
not
yet
got
up
and
to
whom
he
had
bidden
adieu
the
night
before
he
left
the
house
he
had
seen
the
flood
of
tears
that
filled
his
mother
eyes
as
he
crossed
the
threshold
and
he
could
not
help
crying
a
little
himself
it
is
a
sad
thing
to
leave
one
home
one
mother
especially
to
go
out
into
the
great
world
and
we
need
not
wonder
that
bobby
who
had
hardly
been
out
of
riverdale
before
should
weep
but
he
soon
restrained
the
flowing
tears
now
or
never
said
he
and
he
put
his
best
foot
forward
it
was
an
epoch
in
his
history
and
though
he
was
too
young
to
realize
the
importance
of
the
event
he
seemed
to
feel
that
what
he
did
now
was
to
give
character
to
his
whole
future
life
it
was
a
bright
and
beautiful
morning
somehow
it
is
always
a
bright
and
beautiful
morning
when
boys
leave
their
homes
to
commence
the
journey
of
life
it
is
typical
of
the
season
of
youth
and
hope
and
it
is
meet
that
the
sky
should
be
clear
and
the
sun
shine
brightly
when
the
little
pilgrim
sets
out
upon
his
tour
he
will
see
clouds
and
storms
before
he
has
gone
far
let
him
have
a
fair
start
he
had
to
walk
five
miles
to
the
nearest
railroad
station
his
road
lay
by
the
house
of
his
friend
squire
lee
and
as
he
was
approaching
it
he
met
annie
she
said
she
had
come
out
to
take
her
morning
walk
but
bobby
knew
very
well
that
she
did
not
usually
walk
till
an
hour
later
which
with
the
fact
that
she
had
asked
him
particularly
the
day
before
what
time
he
was
going
made
bobby
believe
that
she
had
come
out
to
say
good
by
and
bid
him
god
speed
on
his
journey
at
any
rate
he
was
very
glad
to
see
her
he
said
a
great
many
pretty
things
to
her
and
talked
so
big
about
what
he
was
going
to
do
that
the
little
maiden
could
hardly
help
laughing
in
his
face
then
at
the
house
he
shook
hands
with
the
squire
and
shook
hands
again
with
annie
and
resumed
his
journey
his
heart
felt
lighter
for
having
met
them
or
at
least
for
having
met
one
of
them
if
not
both
for
annie
eyes
were
so
full
of
sunshine
that
they
seemed
to
gladden
his
heart
and
make
him
feel
truer
and
stronger
after
a
pleasant
walk
for
he
scarcely
heeded
the
distance
so
full
was
he
of
his
big
thoughts
he
reached
the
railroad
station
the
cars
had
not
yet
arrived
and
would
not
for
half
an
hour
why
should
i
give
them
a
dollar
for
carrying
me
to
boston
when
i
can
just
as
well
walk
if
i
get
tired
i
can
sit
down
and
rest
me
if
i
save
the
dollar
i
shall
have
to
earn
only
more
to
pay
my
note
so
here
goes
and
he
started
down
the
track
chapter
vii
in
which
bobby
stands
up
for
certain
inalienable
rights
whether
it
was
wise
policy
or
penny
wise
and
pound
foolish
policy
for
bobby
to
undertake
such
a
long
walk
is
certainly
a
debatable
question
but
as
my
young
readers
would
probably
object
to
an
argument
we
will
follow
him
to
the
city
and
let
every
one
settle
the
point
to
suit
himself
his
cheerful
heart
made
the
road
smooth
beneath
his
feet
he
had
always
been
accustomed
to
an
active
busy
life
and
had
probably
often
walked
more
than
twenty
miles
in
a
day
about
ten
though
he
did
not
feel
much
fatigued
he
seated
himself
on
a
rock
by
a
brook
from
which
he
had
just
taken
a
drink
to
rest
himself
he
had
walked
slowly
so
as
to
husband
his
strength
and
he
felt
confident
that
he
should
be
able
to
accomplish
the
journey
without
injury
to
himself
after
resting
for
half
an
hour
he
resumed
his
walk
at
twelve
he
reached
a
point
from
which
he
obtained
his
first
view
of
the
city
his
heart
bounded
at
the
sight
and
his
first
impulse
was
to
increase
his
speed
so
that
he
should
the
sooner
gratify
his
curiosity
but
a
second
thought
reminded
him
that
he
had
eaten
nothing
since
breakfast
so
finding
a
shady
tree
by
the
road
side
he
seated
himself
on
a
stone
to
eat
the
luncheon
which
his
considerate
mother
had
placed
in
his
bundle
thus
refreshed
he
felt
like
a
new
man
and
continued
his
journey
again
till
he
was
on
the
very
outskirts
of
the
city
where
a
sign
no
passing
over
this
bridge
interrupted
his
farther
progress
unlike
many
others
bobby
took
this
sign
literally
and
did
not
venture
to
cross
the
bridge
having
some
doubts
as
to
the
direct
road
to
the
city
he
hailed
a
man
in
a
butcher
cart
who
not
only
pointed
the
way
but
gave
him
an
invitation
to
ride
with
him
which
bobby
was
glad
to
accept
they
crossed
the
milldam
and
the
little
pilgrim
forgot
the
long
walk
he
had
taken
forgot
riverdale
his
mother
squire
lee
and
annie
for
the
time
in
the
absorbing
interest
of
the
exciting
scene
the
common
beat
riverdale
common
all
hollow
he
had
never
seen
anything
like
it
before
but
when
the
wagon
reached
washington
street
the
measure
of
his
surprise
was
filled
up
my
gracious
how
thick
the
houses
are
exclaimed
he
much
to
the
amusement
of
the
butcher
we
have
high
fences
here
he
replied
where
are
all
these
folks
going
to
you
will
have
to
ask
them
if
you
want
to
know
but
the
wonder
soon
abated
and
bobby
began
to
think
of
his
great
mission
in
the
city
he
got
tired
of
gazing
and
wondering
and
even
began
to
smile
with
contempt
at
the
silly
fops
as
they
sauntered
along
and
the
gayly
dressed
ladies
that
flaunted
like
so
many
idle
butterflies
on
the
sidewalk
it
was
an
exciting
scene
but
it
did
not
look
real
to
him
it
was
more
like
herr
grunderslung
exhibition
of
the
magic
lantern
than
anything
substantial
the
men
and
women
were
like
so
many
puppets
they
did
not
seem
to
be
doing
anything
or
to
be
walking
for
any
purpose
he
got
out
of
the
butcher
cart
at
the
old
south
his
first
impression
as
he
joined
the
busy
throng
was
that
he
was
one
of
the
puppets
he
did
not
seem
to
have
any
hold
upon
the
scene
and
for
several
minutes
this
sensation
of
vacancy
chained
him
to
the
spot
all
right
exclaimed
he
to
himself
at
last
i
am
here
now
my
time
to
make
a
strike
now
or
never
he
pulled
bayard
card
from
his
pocket
and
fixed
the
number
of
his
store
in
his
mind
now
numbers
were
not
a
riverdale
institution
and
bobby
was
a
little
perplexed
about
finding
the
one
indicated
a
little
study
into
the
matter
however
set
him
right
and
he
soon
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
the
bookseller
name
over
his
store
bayard
he
read
this
is
the
place
country
shouted
a
little
ragged
boy
who
dodged
across
the
street
at
that
moment
just
so
my
beauty
said
bobby
a
little
nettled
at
this
imputation
of
verdancy
what
a
greeny
shouted
the
little
vagabond
from
the
other
side
of
the
street
no
matter
we
settle
that
matter
some
other
time
but
bobby
felt
that
there
was
something
in
his
appearance
which
subjected
him
to
the
remarks
of
others
and
as
he
entered
the
shop
he
determined
to
correct
it
as
soon
as
possible
a
spruce
young
gentleman
was
behind
the
counter
who
cast
a
mischievous
glance
at
him
as
he
entered
bayard
keep
here
asked
bobby
well
i
reckon
he
does
how
are
all
the
folks
up
country
replied
the
spruce
clerk
with
a
rude
grin
how
are
they
repeated
bobby
the
color
flying
to
his
cheek
yes
do
they
dew
they
behave
themselves
better
than
they
do
here
eh
greeny
eh
sappy
repeated
bobby
mimicking
the
soft
silky
tones
of
the
young
city
gentleman
what
do
you
mean
by
sappy
asked
the
clerk
indignantly
what
do
you
mean
by
greeny
i
let
you
know
what
i
mean
when
you
do
i
let
you
know
what
i
mean
by
sappy
good
exclaimed
one
of
the
salesmen
who
had
heard
part
of
this
spirited
conversation
you
will
learn
better
by
and
by
timmins
than
to
impose
upon
boys
from
out
of
town
you
seem
to
be
a
gentleman
sir
said
bobby
approaching
the
salesman
i
wish
to
see
mr
bayard
you
ca
see
him
growled
timmins
ca
i
not
at
this
minute
he
is
engaged
just
now
added
the
salesman
who
seemed
to
have
a
profound
respect
for
bobby
discrimination
he
will
be
at
liberty
in
a
few
moments
i
will
wait
then
said
bobby
seating
himself
on
a
stool
by
the
counter
pretty
soon
the
civil
gentleman
left
the
store
to
go
to
dinner
and
timmins
a
little
timid
about
provoking
the
young
lion
cast
an
occasional
glance
of
hatred
at
him
he
had
evidently
found
that
country
was
an
embryo
american
citizen
and
that
he
was
a
firm
believer
in
the
truths
of
the
declaration
of
independence
bobby
bore
no
ill
will
towards
the
spruce
clerk
ready
as
he
had
been
to
defend
his
certain
inalienable
rights
you
do
a
big
business
here
suggested
bobby
in
a
conciliatory
tone
and
with
a
smile
on
his
face
which
ought
to
have
convinced
the
uncourteous
clerk
that
he
meant
well
who
told
you
so
replied
timmins
gruffly
i
merely
judged
from
appearances
you
have
a
big
store
and
an
immense
quantity
of
books
appearances
are
deceitful
replied
timmins
and
perhaps
he
had
been
impressed
by
the
fact
from
his
experience
with
the
lad
from
the
country
that
is
true
added
bobby
with
a
smile
which
when
interpreted
might
have
meant
i
took
you
for
a
civil
fellow
but
i
have
been
very
much
mistaken
you
will
find
it
out
before
you
are
many
days
older
the
book
business
is
good
just
now
is
it
continued
bobby
without
clearly
comprehending
the
meaning
of
the
other
last
remark
humph
what
that
to
you
o
i
intend
to
go
into
it
myself
ha
ha
ha
good
you
do
i
do
replied
bobby
seemingly
unconcerned
at
the
taunts
of
the
clerk
i
suppose
you
want
to
get
a
place
here
sneered
timmins
alarmed
at
the
prospect
but
let
me
tell
you
you
ca
do
it
bayard
has
all
the
help
he
wants
and
if
that
is
what
you
come
for
you
can
move
on
as
fast
as
you
please
i
guess
i
will
see
him
added
bobby
quietly
no
use
no
harm
in
seeing
him
as
he
spoke
he
took
up
a
book
that
lay
on
the
counter
and
began
to
turn
over
the
leaves
put
that
book
down
said
the
amiable
timmins
i
wo
hurt
it
replied
bobby
who
had
just
fixed
his
eye
upon
some
very
pretty
engravings
in
the
volume
put
it
down
repeated
timmins
in
a
loud
imperative
tone
certainly
i
will
if
you
say
so
said
bobby
who
though
not
much
intimidated
by
the
harsh
tones
of
the
clerk
did
not
know
the
rules
of
the
store
and
deemed
it
prudent
not
to
meddle
i
say
so
added
timmins
magnificently
and
more
you
better
mind
me
too
bobby
had
minded
and
probably
the
stately
little
clerk
would
not
have
been
so
bold
if
he
had
not
some
people
like
to
threaten
after
the
danger
is
over
then
our
visitor
from
the
country
espied
some
little
blank
books
lying
on
the
counter
he
had
already
made
up
his
mind
to
have
one
in
which
to
keep
his
accounts
and
he
thought
while
he
was
waiting
that
he
would
purchase
one
he
meant
to
do
things
methodically
so
when
he
picked
up
one
of
the
blank
books
it
was
with
the
intention
of
buying
it
put
that
book
down
said
timmins
encouraged
in
his
aggressive
intentions
by
the
previous
docility
of
our
hero
i
want
to
buy
one
no
you
do
put
it
down
what
is
the
price
of
these
asked
bobby
resolutely
none
of
your
business
is
that
the
way
you
treat
your
customers
asked
bobby
with
a
little
sternness
in
his
looks
and
tones
i
say
i
want
to
buy
one
put
it
down
but
i
will
not
i
say
i
want
to
buy
it
no
you
do
what
is
the
price
of
it
cents
growled
timmins
which
was
just
four
times
the
retail
price
cents
that
high
put
it
down
then
is
that
your
lowest
price
asked
bobby
who
was
as
cool
as
a
cucumber
yes
it
is
and
if
you
do
put
it
down
i
kick
you
out
of
the
store
will
you
then
i
wo
put
it
down
timmins
took
this
as
a
stump
his
ire
was
up
and
he
walked
round
from
behind
the
counter
to
execute
his
threat
i
must
say
i
think
bobby
was
a
little
forward
and
i
would
have
my
young
readers
a
little
more
pliant
with
small
men
like
timmins
there
are
always
men
enough
in
the
world
who
are
ready
and
willing
to
quarrel
on
any
provocation
and
it
is
always
best
not
to
provoke
them
even
if
they
are
overbearing
and
insolent
as
timmins
certainly
was
hold
on
a
minute
before
you
do
it
said
bobby
with
the
same
provoking
coolness
i
want
to
buy
this
book
and
i
am
willing
to
pay
a
fair
price
for
it
but
i
happen
to
know
that
you
can
buy
them
up
in
riverdale
where
i
came
from
for
six
cents
no
matter
exclaimed
the
indignant
clerk
seizing
bobby
by
the
coat
collar
for
the
purpose
of
ejecting
him
you
shall
find
your
way
into
the
street
now
bobby
as
i
have
before
intimated
was
an
embryo
american
citizen
and
the
act
of
timmins
seemed
like
an
invasion
of
his
inalienable
rights
no
time
was
given
him
to
make
a
formal
declaration
of
rights
in
the
premises
so
the
instinct
of
was
allowed
to
have
free
course
timmins
pulled
and
tugged
at
his
coat
collar
and
bobby
hung
back
like
a
mule
and
for
an
instant
there
was
quite
a
spirited
scene
hallo
timmins
what
does
this
mean
said
a
voice
at
which
the
valiant
little
clerk
instantly
let
go
his
hold
chapter
viii
in
which
timmins
is
astonished
and
bobby
dines
in
chestnut
street
it
was
bayard
he
had
finished
his
business
with
the
gentleman
by
his
side
and
hearing
the
noise
of
the
scuffle
had
come
to
learn
the
occasion
of
it
this
impudent
young
puppy
would
let
the
books
alone
began
timmins
i
threatened
to
turn
him
out
if
he
did
and
i
meant
to
make
good
my
threat
i
think
he
meant
to
steal
something
bobby
was
astonished
and
shocked
at
this
bold
imputation
but
he
wished
to
have
his
case
judged
on
its
own
merits
so
he
turned
his
face
away
that
bayard
might
not
recognize
him
i
wanted
to
buy
one
of
these
blank
books
added
bobby
picking
up
the
one
he
had
dropped
on
the
floor
in
the
struggle
all
stuff
ejaculated
timmins
he
is
an
impudent
obstinate
puppy
in
my
opinion
he
meant
to
steal
that
book
i
asked
him
the
price
and
told
him
i
wanted
to
buy
it
added
bobby
still
averting
his
face
well
i
told
him
and
he
said
it
was
too
high
he
asked
me
cents
for
it
is
this
true
timmins
asked
bayard
sternly
no
i
told
him
fourpence
replied
timmins
boldly
by
gracious
what
a
whopper
exclaimed
bobby
startled
out
of
his
propriety
by
this
monstrous
lie
he
said
cents
and
i
told
him
i
could
buy
one
up
in
riverdale
where
i
came
from
for
six
cents
can
you
deny
that
it
a
lie
protested
timmins
riverdale
said
bayard
are
you
from
riverdale
boy
yes
sir
i
am
and
if
you
will
look
on
your
memorandum
book
you
will
find
my
name
there
bless
me
i
am
sure
i
have
seen
that
face
before
exclaimed
bayard
as
he
grasped
the
hand
of
bobby
much
to
the
astonishment
and
consternation
of
timmins
you
are
robert
bright
sir
my
brave
little
fellow
i
am
heartily
glad
to
see
you
and
the
bookseller
shook
the
hand
he
held
with
hearty
good
will
i
was
thinking
of
you
only
a
little
while
ago
this
fellow
calls
me
a
liar
said
bobby
pointing
to
the
astonished
timmins
who
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
the
cordial
reception
which
country
was
receiving
from
his
employer
well
robert
we
know
that
is
a
liar
this
is
not
the
first
time
he
has
been
caught
in
a
lie
timmins
your
time
is
out
the
spruce
clerk
hung
his
head
with
shame
and
mortification
i
hope
sir
you
will
he
began
but
pride
or
fear
stopped
him
short
do
be
hard
with
him
sir
if
you
please
said
bobby
i
suppose
i
aggravated
him
bayard
looked
at
the
gentleman
who
stood
by
his
side
and
a
smile
of
approbation
lighted
up
his
face
generous
as
he
is
noble
butler
this
is
the
boy
that
saved
ellen
indeed
he
is
a
little
giant
replied
butler
grasping
hand
even
timmins
glanced
with
something
like
admiration
in
his
looks
at
the
youth
whom
he
had
so
lately
despised
perhaps
too
he
thought
of
that
scripture
wisdom
about
entertaining
angels
unawares
he
was
very
much
abashed
and
nothing
but
his
silly
pride
prevented
him
from
acknowledging
his
error
and
begging
bobby
forgiveness
i
ca
have
a
liar
about
me
said
bayard
there
may
be
some
mistake
suggested
butler
i
think
not
robert
bright
could
lie
so
brave
and
noble
a
boy
is
incapable
of
a
falsehood
besides
i
got
a
letter
from
my
friend
squire
lee
by
this
morning
mail
in
which
he
informed
me
of
my
young
friend
coming
bayard
took
from
his
pocket
a
bundle
of
letters
and
selected
the
squire
from
among
them
opening
it
he
read
a
passage
which
had
a
direct
bearing
upon
the
case
before
him
do
not
know
what
bobby
faults
are
the
letter
said
this
i
do
know
that
bobby
would
rather
be
whipped
than
tell
a
lie
he
is
noted
through
the
place
for
his
love
of
truth
that
is
pretty
strong
testimony
and
you
see
bobby
that
what
the
squire
calls
you
your
reputation
has
preceded
you
bobby
blushed
as
he
always
did
when
he
was
praised
and
timmins
was
more
abashed
than
ever
did
you
hear
that
timmins
who
is
the
liar
now
said
bayard
turning
to
the
culprit
forgive
me
sir
this
time
if
you
turn
me
off
now
i
can
not
get
another
place
and
my
mother
depends
upon
my
wages
you
ought
to
have
thought
of
this
before
he
aggravated
me
sir
so
that
i
wanted
to
pay
him
off
as
to
that
he
commenced
upon
me
the
moment
i
came
into
the
store
but
do
turn
him
off
if
you
please
sir
said
bobby
who
even
now
wished
no
harm
to
his
discomfited
assailant
he
will
do
better
hereafter
wo
you
timmins
thus
appealed
to
timmins
though
he
did
not
relish
so
direct
an
inquiry
and
from
such
a
source
was
compelled
to
reply
in
the
affirmative
and
bayard
graciously
remitted
the
sentence
he
had
passed
against
the
offending
clerk
now
robert
you
will
come
over
to
my
house
and
dine
with
me
ellen
will
be
delighted
to
see
you
thank
you
sir
replied
bobby
bashfully
i
have
been
to
dinner
referring
to
the
luncheon
he
had
eaten
at
brighton
but
you
must
go
to
the
house
with
me
i
should
be
very
glad
to
do
so
sir
but
i
came
on
business
i
will
stay
here
with
timmins
till
you
come
back
the
truth
is
he
had
heard
something
about
the
fine
houses
of
the
city
and
how
stylish
the
people
were
and
he
had
some
misgivings
about
venturing
into
such
a
strange
and
untried
scene
as
the
parlor
of
a
boston
merchant
indeed
you
must
come
with
me
ellen
would
never
forgive
you
or
me
if
you
did
not
come
i
would
rather
rest
here
till
you
return
replied
bobby
still
willing
to
escape
the
fine
house
and
the
fine
folks
i
walked
from
riverdale
sir
and
i
am
rather
tired
walked
exclaimed
bayard
had
you
no
money
yes
sir
enough
to
pay
my
passage
but
franklin
says
that
penny
saved
is
a
penny
earned
and
i
thought
i
would
try
it
i
shall
get
rested
by
the
time
you
return
but
you
must
go
with
me
timmins
go
and
get
a
carriage
timmins
obeyed
and
before
bayard
had
finished
asking
bobby
how
all
the
people
in
riverdale
were
the
carriage
was
at
the
door
there
was
no
backing
out
now
and
our
hero
was
obliged
to
get
into
the
vehicle
though
it
seemed
altogether
too
fine
for
a
poor
boy
like
him
bayard
and
butler
whom
the
former
had
invited
to
dine
with
him
seated
themselves
beside
him
and
the
driver
was
directed
to
set
them
down
at
no
chestnut
street
where
they
soon
arrived
though
my
readers
would
no
doubt
be
very
much
amused
to
learn
how
carefully
bobby
trod
the
velvet
carpets
how
he
stared
with
wonder
at
the
drapery
curtains
at
the
tall
mirrors
the
elegant
chandeliers
and
the
fantastically
shaped
chairs
and
tables
that
adorned
bayard
parlor
the
length
of
our
story
does
not
permit
us
to
pause
over
these
trivial
matters
when
ellen
bayard
was
informed
that
her
little
deliverer
was
in
the
house
she
rushed
into
the
parlor
like
a
hoiden
school
girl
grasped
both
his
hands
kissed
both
his
rosy
cheeks
and
behaved
just
as
though
she
had
never
been
to
a
boarding
school
in
her
life
she
had
thought
a
great
deal
about
bobby
since
that
eventful
day
and
the
more
she
thought
of
him
the
more
she
liked
him
her
admiration
of
him
was
not
of
that
silly
sentimental
character
which
moonstruck
young
ladies
cherish
towards
those
immaculate
young
men
who
have
saved
them
from
drowning
in
a
horse
pond
pulled
them
back
just
as
they
were
tumbling
over
a
precipice
two
thousand
five
hundred
feet
high
or
rescued
them
from
a
house
seven
stories
high
bearing
them
down
a
ladder
odd
feet
long
the
fact
was
bobby
was
a
boy
of
thirteen
and
there
was
no
chance
for
much
sentiment
so
the
young
lady
regard
was
real
earnest
and
lifelike
ellen
said
a
great
many
very
handsome
things
but
i
am
sure
she
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
as
that
he
would
run
away
with
her
in
case
her
papa
was
unnecessarily
obstinate
she
was
very
glad
to
see
him
and
i
have
no
doubt
she
wished
bobby
might
be
her
brother
it
would
be
so
glorious
to
have
such
a
noble
little
fellow
always
with
her
bobby
managed
the
dinner
much
better
than
he
had
anticipated
for
bayard
insisted
that
he
should
sit
down
with
them
whether
he
ate
anything
or
not
but
the
rubicon
passed
our
hero
found
that
he
had
a
pretty
smart
appetite
and
did
full
justice
to
the
viands
set
before
him
it
is
true
the
silver
forks
the
napkins
the
finger
bowls
and
other
articles
of
luxury
and
show
to
which
he
had
been
entirely
unaccustomed
bothered
him
not
a
little
but
he
kept
perfectly
cool
and
carefully
observed
how
butler
who
sat
next
to
him
handled
the
spoon
fork
what
he
did
with
the
napkin
and
the
finger
bowl
so
that
i
will
venture
to
say
not
one
in
ten
would
have
suspected
he
had
not
spent
his
life
in
the
parlor
of
a
millionaire
dinner
over
the
party
returned
to
the
parlor
where
bobby
unfolded
his
plan
for
the
future
to
make
his
story
intelligible
he
was
obliged
to
tell
them
all
about
hardhand
the
old
wretch
exclaimed
bayard
but
robert
you
must
let
me
advance
the
sixty
dollars
to
pay
squire
lee
no
sir
you
have
done
enough
in
that
way
i
have
given
my
note
for
the
money
whew
said
butler
and
i
shall
soon
earn
enough
to
pay
it
no
doubt
of
it
you
are
a
lad
of
courage
and
energy
and
you
will
succeed
in
everything
you
undertake
i
shall
want
you
to
trust
me
for
a
stock
of
books
on
the
strength
of
old
acquaintance
continued
bobby
who
had
now
grown
quite
bold
and
felt
as
much
at
home
in
the
midst
of
the
costly
furniture
as
he
did
in
the
living
room
of
the
old
black
house
you
shall
have
all
the
books
you
want
i
will
pay
for
them
as
soon
as
i
return
the
truth
is
bayard
i
mean
to
be
independent
i
did
want
to
take
that
dollars
though
i
do
know
what
hardhand
would
have
done
to
us
if
i
had
ellen
said
i
ought
to
have
given
you
a
hundred
and
i
think
so
myself
i
am
glad
you
did
too
much
money
makes
us
fat
and
lazy
bayard
laughed
at
the
easy
of
the
lad
at
his
big
talk
though
big
as
it
was
it
meant
something
when
he
proposed
to
go
to
the
store
he
told
bobby
he
had
better
stay
at
the
house
and
rest
himself
no
sir
i
want
to
start
out
and
i
must
get
ready
you
had
better
put
it
off
till
the
next
day
you
will
feel
more
like
it
then
now
or
never
replied
bobby
that
is
my
motto
sir
if
we
have
anything
to
do
now
is
always
the
best
time
to
do
it
franklin
says
put
off
till
what
you
can
do
right
robert
you
shall
have
your
own
way
i
wish
my
clerks
would
adopt
some
of
franklin
wise
saws
i
should
be
a
great
deal
better
off
in
the
course
of
a
year
if
they
would
chapter
ix
in
which
bobby
opens
various
accounts
and
wins
his
first
victory
now
bobby
i
understand
your
plan
said
bayard
when
they
reached
the
store
but
the
details
must
be
settled
where
do
you
intend
to
go
i
hardly
know
sir
i
suppose
i
can
sell
books
almost
anywhere
very
true
but
in
some
places
much
better
than
in
others
bayard
mentioned
a
large
town
about
eighteen
miles
from
the
city
in
which
he
thought
a
good
trade
might
be
carried
on
and
bobby
at
once
decided
to
adopt
the
suggestion
you
can
make
this
place
your
headquarters
for
the
week
if
books
do
not
sell
well
right
in
the
village
why
you
can
go
out
a
little
way
for
the
country
in
the
vicinity
is
peopled
by
intelligent
farmers
who
are
well
off
and
who
can
afford
to
buy
books
i
was
thinking
of
that
but
what
shall
i
take
with
me
sir
there
is
a
new
book
just
published
called
wayfarer
which
is
going
to
have
a
tremendous
run
it
has
been
advertised
in
advance
all
over
the
country
so
that
you
will
find
a
ready
sale
for
it
you
will
get
it
there
before
any
one
else
and
have
the
market
all
to
yourself
wayfarer
i
have
heard
of
it
myself
you
shall
take
fifty
copies
with
you
and
if
you
find
that
you
shall
want
more
write
and
i
will
send
them
but
i
can
not
carry
fifty
copies
you
must
take
the
cars
to
b
and
have
a
trunk
or
box
to
carry
your
books
in
i
have
a
stout
trunk
down
cellar
which
you
shall
have
i
will
pay
for
it
sir
never
mind
that
bobby
and
you
will
want
a
small
valise
or
carpet
bag
to
carry
your
books
from
house
to
house
i
will
lend
you
one
you
are
very
kind
sir
i
did
not
mean
to
ask
any
favors
of
you
except
to
trust
me
for
the
books
until
my
return
all
right
bobby
bayard
called
the
porter
and
ordered
him
to
bring
up
the
trunk
in
which
he
directed
timmins
to
pack
fifty
wayfarers
now
how
much
will
these
books
cost
me
apiece
asked
bobby
the
retail
price
is
one
dollar
the
wholesale
price
is
one
third
off
and
you
shall
have
them
at
what
they
cost
me
cents
added
bobby
that
will
give
me
a
profit
of
cents
on
each
book
just
so
perhaps
timmins
will
sell
me
one
of
those
blank
books
now
for
i
like
to
have
things
down
in
black
and
white
i
will
furnish
you
with
something
much
better
than
that
and
bayard
left
the
counting
room
in
a
moment
he
returned
with
a
handsome
pocket
memorandum
book
which
he
presented
to
the
little
merchant
but
i
do
like
to
take
it
unless
you
will
let
me
pay
for
it
said
bobby
hesitating
never
mind
it
my
young
friend
now
you
can
sit
down
at
my
desk
and
open
your
accounts
i
like
to
see
boys
methodical
and
there
is
nothing
like
keeping
accounts
to
make
one
accurate
keep
your
books
posted
up
and
you
will
know
where
you
are
at
any
time
i
intend
to
keep
an
account
of
all
i
spend
and
all
i
receive
if
it
is
no
more
than
a
cent
right
my
little
man
have
you
ever
studied
no
sir
i
suppose
i
have
but
there
was
a
page
of
accounts
in
the
back
part
of
the
arithmetic
i
studied
and
i
got
a
pretty
good
idea
of
the
thing
from
that
all
the
money
received
goes
on
one
side
and
all
the
money
paid
out
goes
on
the
other
exactly
so
in
this
book
you
had
better
open
a
book
account
first
if
you
wish
i
will
show
you
how
thank
you
sir
i
should
be
very
glad
to
have
you
and
bobby
opened
the
memorandum
book
and
seated
himself
at
the
desk
write
account
at
the
top
of
the
pages
one
word
on
each
very
well
now
write
fifty
copies
of
wayfarer
at
cents
on
the
page
or
debit
side
of
the
account
i
am
not
much
of
a
writer
said
bobby
apologetically
you
will
improve
now
each
day
you
will
credit
the
amount
of
sales
on
the
right
hand
page
or
credit
side
of
the
account
so
when
you
have
sold
out
the
balance
due
your
debit
side
will
be
the
profit
on
the
lot
do
you
understand
it
bobby
thought
a
moment
before
he
could
see
through
it
but
his
brain
was
active
and
he
soon
managed
the
idea
now
you
want
a
personal
account
and
bayard
explained
to
him
how
to
make
this
out
he
then
instructed
him
to
enter
on
the
debit
side
all
he
spent
for
travel
board
freight
and
other
charges
the
next
was
the
profit
and
loss
account
which
was
to
show
him
the
net
profit
of
the
business
our
hero
who
had
a
decided
taste
for
accounts
was
very
much
pleased
with
this
employment
and
when
the
accounts
were
all
opened
he
regarded
them
with
a
great
deal
of
satisfaction
he
longed
to
commence
his
operations
if
it
were
only
for
the
pleasure
of
making
the
entries
in
this
book
one
thing
i
forgot
said
he
as
he
seized
the
pen
and
under
the
cash
account
entered
to
cash
from
mother
now
i
am
all
right
i
believe
i
think
you
are
now
the
cars
leave
at
seven
in
the
morning
can
you
be
ready
for
a
start
as
early
as
that
asked
bayard
o
yes
sir
i
hope
so
i
get
up
at
half
past
four
at
home
very
well
my
small
valise
is
at
the
house
but
i
believe
everything
else
is
ready
now
i
have
some
business
to
attend
to
and
if
you
will
amuse
yourself
for
an
hour
or
two
we
will
go
home
then
i
shall
want
a
lodging
place
when
i
am
in
the
city
perhaps
some
of
your
folks
can
direct
me
to
one
where
they
wo
charge
too
much
as
to
that
bobby
you
must
go
to
my
house
whenever
you
are
in
the
city
law
sir
you
live
so
grand
i
could
think
of
going
to
your
house
i
am
only
a
poor
boy
from
the
country
and
i
do
know
how
to
behave
myself
among
such
nice
folks
you
will
do
very
well
bobby
ellen
would
never
forgive
me
if
i
let
you
go
anywhere
else
so
that
is
settled
you
will
go
to
my
house
now
you
may
sit
here
or
walk
out
and
see
the
sights
if
you
please
sir
if
timmins
will
let
me
look
at
some
of
the
books
i
should
wish
for
anything
better
i
should
like
to
look
at
wayfarer
so
that
i
shall
know
how
to
recommend
it
timmins
let
you
replied
bayard
as
he
touched
the
spring
of
a
bell
on
his
desk
the
dapper
clerk
came
running
into
the
counting
room
to
attend
the
summons
of
his
employer
timmins
continued
bayard
with
a
mischievous
smile
bring
mr
bright
a
copy
of
wayfarer
timmins
was
astonished
to
hear
country
called
mister
astonished
to
hear
his
employer
call
him
mister
and
bobby
was
astonished
to
hear
himself
called
mister
nevertheless
our
hero
enjoyed
the
joke
the
clerk
brought
the
book
and
bobby
proceeded
to
give
it
a
thorough
critical
examination
he
read
the
preface
the
table
of
contents
and
several
chapters
of
the
work
before
bayard
was
ready
to
go
home
how
do
you
like
it
bobby
asked
the
bookseller
first
rate
you
may
take
that
copy
in
your
hand
you
will
want
to
finish
it
thank
you
sir
i
will
be
careful
of
it
you
may
keep
it
let
that
be
the
beginning
of
your
own
private
library
his
own
private
library
bobby
had
not
got
far
enough
to
dream
of
such
a
thing
yet
but
he
thanked
bayard
and
put
the
book
under
his
arm
after
tea
ellen
proposed
to
her
father
that
they
should
all
go
to
the
museum
bayard
acceded
and
our
hero
was
duly
amazed
at
the
drolleries
perpetrated
there
he
had
a
good
time
but
it
was
so
late
when
he
went
to
bed
that
he
was
a
little
fearful
lest
he
should
himself
in
the
morning
he
did
not
however
and
was
down
in
the
parlor
before
any
of
the
rest
of
the
family
were
stirring
an
early
breakfast
was
prepared
for
him
at
which
bayard
who
intended
to
see
him
off
joined
him
depositing
his
little
bundle
and
the
copy
of
the
wayfarer
in
the
valise
provided
for
him
they
walked
to
the
store
the
porter
wheeled
the
trunk
down
to
the
railroad
station
though
bobby
insisted
upon
doing
it
himself
the
bookseller
saw
him
and
his
baggage
safely
aboard
of
the
cars
gave
him
a
ticket
and
then
bade
him
an
affectionate
adieu
in
a
little
while
bobby
was
flying
over
the
rail
and
at
about
eight
reached
b
the
station
master
kindly
permitted
him
to
deposit
his
trunk
in
the
baggage
room
and
to
leave
it
there
for
the
remainder
of
the
week
taking
a
dozen
of
the
books
from
the
trunk
and
placing
them
in
his
valise
he
sallied
out
upon
his
mission
it
must
be
confessed
that
his
heart
was
filled
with
a
tumult
of
emotions
the
battle
of
life
was
before
him
he
was
on
the
field
sword
in
hand
ready
to
plunge
into
the
contest
it
was
victory
or
defeat
march
on
brave
youth
the
field
of
strife
with
peril
fraught
before
thee
lies
march
on
the
battle
plain
of
life
shall
yield
thee
yet
a
glorious
prize
it
was
of
no
use
to
shrink
then
even
if
he
had
felt
disposed
to
do
so
he
was
prepared
to
be
rebuffed
to
be
insulted
to
be
turned
away
from
the
doors
at
which
he
should
seek
admission
but
he
was
determined
to
conquer
he
had
reached
a
house
at
which
he
proposed
to
offer
the
wayfarer
for
sale
his
heart
went
pit
pat
pit
pat
and
he
paused
before
the
door
now
or
never
exclaimed
he
as
he
swung
open
the
garden
gate
and
made
his
way
up
to
the
door
he
felt
some
misgivings
it
was
so
new
and
strange
to
him
that
he
could
hardly
muster
sufficient
resolution
to
proceed
farther
but
his
irresolution
was
of
only
a
moment
duration
now
or
never
and
he
gave
a
vigorous
knock
at
the
door
it
was
opened
by
an
elderly
lady
whose
physiognomy
did
not
promise
much
good
morning
can
i
sell
you
a
copy
of
wayfarer
a
new
book
just
published
no
i
do
want
none
of
your
books
there
more
pedlers
round
the
country
now
than
you
could
shake
a
stick
at
in
a
month
replied
the
old
lady
petulantly
it
is
a
very
interesting
book
has
an
excellent
moral
bobby
had
read
the
preface
as
i
before
remarked
it
will
suit
you
for
you
look
just
like
a
lady
who
wants
to
read
something
with
a
moral
bravo
bobby
the
lady
concluded
that
her
face
had
a
moral
expression
and
she
was
pleased
with
the
idea
let
me
see
it
and
she
asked
bobby
to
walk
in
and
be
seated
while
she
went
for
her
spectacles
as
she
was
looking
over
the
book
our
hero
went
into
a
more
elaborate
recommendation
of
its
merits
he
was
sure
it
would
interest
the
young
and
the
old
it
taught
a
good
lesson
it
had
elegant
engravings
the
type
was
large
which
would
suit
her
eyes
it
was
well
printed
and
bound
and
finally
it
was
cheap
at
one
dollar
i
take
it
said
the
old
lady
thank
you
bobby
first
victory
was
achieved
have
you
got
a
dollar
asked
the
lady
as
she
handed
him
a
bill
yes
and
he
gave
her
his
only
dollar
and
put
the
two
in
its
place
prouder
than
a
king
who
has
conquered
an
empire
thank
you
bidding
the
lady
a
polite
good
morning
he
left
the
house
encouraged
by
his
success
to
go
forward
in
his
mission
with
undiminished
hope
chapter
x
in
which
bobby
is
a
little
too
smart
the
clouds
were
rolled
back
and
bobby
no
longer
had
a
doubt
as
to
the
success
of
his
undertaking
it
requires
but
a
little
sunshine
to
gladden
the
heart
and
the
influence
of
his
first
success
scattered
all
the
misgivings
he
had
cherished
two
new
england
shillings
is
undoubtedly
a
very
small
sum
of
money
but
bobby
had
made
two
shillings
and
he
would
not
have
considered
himself
more
fortunate
if
some
unknown
relative
had
left
him
a
fortune
it
gave
him
confidence
in
his
powers
and
as
he
walked
away
from
the
house
he
reviewed
the
circumstances
of
his
first
sale
the
old
lady
had
told
him
at
first
she
did
not
wish
to
buy
a
book
and
moreover
had
spoken
rather
contemptuously
of
the
craft
to
which
he
had
now
the
honor
to
belong
he
gave
himself
the
credit
of
having
conquered
the
old
lady
prejudices
he
had
sold
her
a
book
in
spite
of
her
evident
intention
not
to
purchase
in
short
he
had
as
we
have
before
said
won
a
glorious
victory
and
he
congratulated
himself
accordingly
but
it
was
of
no
use
to
waste
time
in
useless
and
bobby
turned
from
the
past
to
the
future
there
were
more
books
to
be
sold
so
that
the
future
was
times
as
big
as
the
past
he
saw
a
shoemaker
shop
ahead
of
him
and
he
was
debating
with
himself
whether
he
should
enter
and
offer
his
books
for
sale
it
would
do
no
harm
though
he
had
but
slight
expectations
of
doing
anything
there
were
three
men
at
work
in
the
shop
one
of
them
a
man
the
other
two
young
men
they
looked
like
persons
of
intelligence
and
as
soon
as
bobby
saw
them
his
hopes
grew
stronger
can
i
sell
you
any
books
asked
the
little
merchant
as
he
crossed
the
threshold
well
i
do
know
that
depends
upon
how
smart
you
are
replied
the
eldest
of
the
men
it
takes
a
pretty
smart
fellow
to
sell
anything
in
this
shop
then
i
hope
to
sell
each
of
you
a
book
added
bobby
laughing
at
the
badinage
of
the
shoemaker
opening
his
valise
he
took
out
three
copies
of
his
book
and
politely
handed
one
to
each
of
the
men
it
is
every
book
pedler
that
comes
along
who
offers
you
such
a
work
as
that
wayfarer
is
decidedly
book
of
the
season
you
do
say
so
said
the
oldest
shoemaker
with
a
laugh
every
pedler
that
comes
along
uses
those
words
precisely
do
they
they
steal
my
thunder
then
you
are
an
old
one
only
thirteen
i
was
born
where
they
do
fasten
the
door
with
a
boiled
carrot
what
do
they
fasten
them
with
they
do
fasten
them
at
all
there
are
no
book
pedlers
round
there
then
and
all
the
shoemakers
laughed
heartily
at
this
smart
sally
no
they
are
all
shoemakers
in
our
town
you
can
take
my
hat
boy
you
will
want
it
to
put
your
head
in
but
i
will
take
one
dollar
for
that
book
instead
the
man
laughed
took
out
his
wallet
and
handed
bobby
the
dollar
probably
quite
as
much
because
he
had
a
high
appreciation
of
his
smartness
as
from
any
desire
to
possess
the
book
wo
you
take
one
asked
bobby
appealing
to
another
of
the
men
who
was
apparently
not
more
than
years
of
age
no
i
ca
read
replied
he
roguishly
let
your
wife
read
it
to
you
then
my
wife
certainly
she
knows
how
to
read
i
will
warrant
how
do
you
know
i
have
got
a
wife
o
well
a
fellow
as
good
looking
and
good
natured
as
you
are
could
not
have
resisted
till
this
time
has
you
tom
added
the
oldest
shoemaker
i
cave
in
and
he
handed
over
the
dollar
and
laid
the
book
upon
his
bench
bobby
looked
at
the
third
man
with
some
interest
he
had
said
nothing
and
scarcely
heeded
the
fun
which
was
passing
between
the
little
merchant
and
his
companions
he
was
apparently
absorbed
in
his
examination
of
the
book
he
was
a
different
kind
of
person
from
the
others
and
bobby
instinctive
knowledge
of
human
nature
assured
him
that
he
was
not
to
be
gained
by
flattery
or
by
smart
sayings
so
he
placed
himself
in
front
of
him
and
patiently
waited
in
silence
for
him
to
complete
his
examination
you
will
find
that
he
is
a
hard
one
put
in
one
of
the
others
bobby
made
no
reply
and
the
two
men
who
had
bought
books
resumed
their
work
for
five
minutes
our
hero
stood
waiting
for
the
man
to
finish
his
investigation
into
the
merits
of
the
wayfarer
something
told
him
not
to
say
anything
to
this
person
and
he
had
some
doubts
about
his
purchasing
i
will
take
one
said
the
last
shoemaker
as
he
handed
bobby
the
dollar
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
gentlemen
said
bobby
as
he
closed
his
valise
when
i
come
this
way
again
i
shall
certainly
call
do
you
have
done
what
no
other
pedler
ever
did
in
this
shop
i
shall
take
no
credit
to
myself
the
fact
is
you
are
men
of
intelligence
and
you
want
good
books
bobby
picked
up
his
valise
and
left
the
shop
satisfied
with
those
who
occupied
it
and
satisfied
with
himself
eight
shillings
exclaimed
he
when
he
got
into
the
road
pretty
good
hour
work
i
should
say
bobby
trudged
along
till
he
came
to
a
very
large
elegant
house
evidently
dwelt
in
by
one
of
the
nabobs
of
b
inspired
by
past
successes
he
walked
boldly
up
to
the
front
door
and
rang
the
bell
is
whiting
in
asked
bobby
who
had
read
the
name
on
the
door
plate
colonel
whiting
in
replied
the
servant
who
had
opened
the
door
i
should
like
to
see
him
for
a
moment
if
he
is
busy
walk
in
and
for
some
reason
or
other
the
servant
chuckled
a
great
deal
as
she
admitted
him
she
conducted
him
to
a
large
elegantly
furnished
parlor
where
bobby
proceeded
to
take
out
his
books
for
the
inspection
of
the
nabob
whom
the
servant
promised
to
send
to
the
parlor
in
a
moment
colonel
whiting
entered
he
was
a
large
fat
man
about
fifty
years
old
he
looked
at
the
little
book
merchant
with
a
frown
that
would
have
annihilated
a
boy
less
spunky
than
our
hero
bobby
was
not
a
little
inflated
by
the
successes
of
the
morning
and
if
julius
cæsar
or
napoleon
bonaparte
had
stood
before
him
then
he
would
not
have
flinched
a
hair
much
less
in
the
presence
of
no
greater
magnate
than
the
nabob
of
b
good
morning
colonel
whiting
i
hope
you
are
well
this
beautiful
morning
bobby
began
i
must
confess
i
think
this
was
a
little
too
familiar
for
a
boy
of
thirteen
to
a
gentleman
of
fifty
whom
he
had
never
seen
before
in
his
life
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
bobby
had
done
a
great
deal
the
week
before
that
on
the
preceding
night
he
had
slept
in
chestnut
street
and
that
he
had
just
sold
four
copies
of
the
wayfarer
he
was
inclined
to
be
smart
and
some
folks
hate
smart
boys
the
nabob
frowned
his
cheek
reddened
with
anger
but
he
did
not
condescend
to
make
any
reply
to
the
smart
speech
i
have
taken
the
liberty
to
call
upon
you
this
morning
to
see
if
you
did
not
wish
to
purchase
a
copy
of
wayfarer
a
new
book
just
issued
from
the
press
which
people
say
is
to
be
the
book
of
the
season
my
young
readers
need
not
suppose
this
was
an
impromptu
speech
for
bobby
had
studied
upon
it
all
the
time
he
was
coming
from
boston
in
the
cars
it
would
be
quite
natural
for
a
boy
who
had
enjoyed
no
greater
educational
advantages
than
our
hero
to
consider
how
he
should
address
people
into
whose
presence
his
calling
would
bring
him
and
he
had
prepared
several
little
addresses
of
this
sort
for
the
several
different
kinds
of
people
whom
he
expected
to
encounter
the
one
he
had
just
got
off
was
designed
for
the
upper
crust
when
he
had
delivered
the
speech
he
approached
the
indignant
frowning
nabob
and
with
a
low
bow
offered
him
a
copy
of
the
wayfarer
boy
said
colonel
whiting
raising
his
arm
with
majestic
dignity
and
pointing
to
the
door
boy
do
you
see
that
door
bobby
looked
at
the
door
and
somewhat
astonished
replied
that
he
did
see
it
that
it
was
a
very
handsome
door
and
he
would
inquire
whether
it
was
black
walnut
or
only
painted
in
imitation
thereof
do
you
see
that
door
thundered
the
nabob
swelling
with
rage
at
the
cool
impudence
of
the
boy
certainly
i
do
sir
my
eyesight
is
excellent
then
use
it
thank
you
sir
i
have
no
use
for
it
probably
it
will
be
of
more
service
to
you
than
to
me
will
you
clear
out
or
shall
i
kick
you
out
gasped
the
enraged
magnate
of
b
i
will
save
you
that
trouble
sir
i
will
go
sir
i
see
we
have
both
made
a
mistake
mistake
what
do
you
mean
by
that
you
young
puppy
you
are
a
little
impudent
thieving
scoundrel
that
is
your
mistake
sir
i
took
you
for
a
gentleman
sir
and
that
was
my
mistake
ha
ha
ha
laughed
a
sweet
musical
voice
and
at
that
moment
a
beautiful
young
lady
rushed
up
to
the
angry
colonel
and
threw
her
arms
around
his
neck
the
jade
muttered
he
i
have
caught
you
in
a
passion
again
uncle
and
the
lady
kissed
the
old
gentleman
cheek
which
seemed
to
restore
him
at
once
to
himself
it
was
enough
to
make
a
minister
swear
said
he
in
apology
no
it
was
uncle
the
boy
was
a
little
pert
it
is
true
but
you
ought
to
have
laughed
at
him
instead
of
getting
angry
i
heard
the
whole
of
it
pert
said
bobby
to
himself
what
the
deuce
does
she
mean
by
that
very
well
you
little
minx
i
will
pay
the
penalty
come
here
master
pert
said
the
lady
to
bobby
bobby
bowed
approached
the
lady
and
began
to
feel
very
much
embarrassed
my
uncle
she
continued
is
one
of
the
men
in
the
world
ai
you
uncle
go
on
you
jade
i
love
him
as
i
would
my
own
father
but
he
will
sometimes
get
into
a
passion
now
you
provoked
him
indeed
i
had
the
least
idea
of
saying
anything
uncivil
pleaded
bobby
i
studied
to
be
as
polite
as
possible
i
dare
say
you
were
too
important
too
pompous
for
a
boy
to
an
old
gentleman
like
uncle
who
is
really
one
of
the
best
men
in
the
world
now
if
you
had
to
be
polite
you
would
have
done
very
well
indeed
i
am
a
poor
boy
trying
to
make
a
little
money
to
help
my
mother
i
am
sure
i
meant
no
harm
i
know
you
did
so
you
are
selling
books
to
help
your
mother
yes
she
inquired
still
further
into
the
little
merchant
history
and
seemed
to
be
very
much
interested
in
him
in
a
frolic
a
few
days
before
bobby
learned
from
her
colonel
whiting
had
agreed
to
pay
any
penalty
she
might
name
the
next
time
he
got
into
a
passion
now
young
man
what
book
have
you
to
sell
asked
the
lady
wayfarer
how
many
have
you
in
your
valise
eight
very
well
now
uncle
i
decree
as
the
penalty
of
your
indiscretion
that
you
purchase
the
whole
stock
i
submit
wayfarer
promises
to
be
an
excellent
book
and
i
can
name
at
least
half
a
dozen
persons
who
will
thank
you
for
a
copy
uncle
colonel
whiting
paid
bobby
eight
dollars
who
left
the
contents
of
his
valise
on
the
centre
table
and
then
departed
astounded
at
his
good
fortune
and
fully
resolved
never
to
be
too
smart
again
chapter
xi
in
which
bobby
strikes
a
balance
and
returns
to
riverdale
our
hero
had
learned
a
lesson
which
experience
alone
could
teach
him
the
consciousness
of
that
something
within
him
inclined
him
to
be
a
little
too
familiar
with
his
elders
but
then
it
gave
him
confidence
in
himself
and
imparted
courage
to
go
forward
in
the
accomplishment
of
his
mission
his
interview
with
colonel
whiting
and
the
gentle
but
plain
rebuke
of
his
niece
had
set
him
right
and
he
realized
that
while
he
was
doing
a
man
work
he
was
still
a
boy
he
had
now
a
clearer
perception
of
what
is
due
to
the
position
and
dignity
of
those
upon
whom
fortune
has
smiled
bobby
wanted
to
be
a
man
and
it
is
not
strange
that
he
should
sometimes
fancy
he
was
a
man
he
had
an
idea
too
that
all
men
are
born
free
and
equal
and
he
could
not
exactly
see
why
a
nabob
was
entitled
to
any
more
respect
and
consideration
than
a
poor
man
it
was
a
lesson
he
was
compelled
to
learn
though
some
folks
live
out
their
lifetimes
without
ever
finding
out
that
is
wealth
good
sir
makes
honorable
men
some
people
think
a
rich
man
is
no
better
than
a
poor
man
except
so
far
as
he
behaves
himself
better
it
is
strange
how
stupid
some
people
are
bobby
had
no
notion
of
cringing
to
any
man
and
he
felt
as
independent
as
the
declaration
of
independence
itself
but
then
the
beautiful
lady
had
told
him
that
he
was
pert
and
forward
and
when
he
thought
it
over
he
was
willing
to
believe
she
was
right
colonel
whiting
was
an
old
man
compared
with
himself
and
he
had
some
faith
at
least
in
theory
in
the
spartan
virtue
of
respect
for
the
aged
probably
the
nabob
of
b
would
have
objected
to
being
treated
with
respect
on
account
of
his
age
and
bobby
would
have
been
equally
unwilling
to
acknowledge
that
he
treated
him
with
peculiar
respect
on
account
of
his
wealth
or
position
perhaps
the
little
merchant
had
an
instinctive
perception
of
expediency
that
he
should
sell
more
books
by
being
less
familiar
at
any
rate
he
determined
never
again
to
use
the
flowery
speeches
he
had
arranged
for
the
upper
crust
he
had
sold
a
dozen
books
and
possibly
this
fact
made
him
more
willing
to
compromise
the
matter
than
he
would
otherwise
have
been
this
was
after
all
the
great
matter
for
congratulation
and
with
a
light
heart
he
hurried
back
to
the
railroad
station
to
procure
another
supply
we
can
not
follow
him
into
every
house
where
his
calling
led
him
he
was
not
always
as
fortunate
as
in
the
instances
we
have
mentioned
sometimes
all
his
arguments
were
unavailing
and
after
he
had
spent
half
an
hour
of
valuable
time
in
setting
forth
the
merits
of
the
wayfarer
he
was
compelled
to
retire
without
having
effected
a
sale
sometimes
too
he
was
rudely
repulsed
hard
epithets
were
applied
to
him
old
men
and
old
women
worried
out
by
the
continued
calls
of
pedlers
sneered
at
him
or
shut
the
door
in
his
face
but
bobby
was
not
disheartened
he
persevered
and
did
not
allow
these
little
trials
to
discompose
or
discourage
him
by
one
on
the
first
day
of
his
service
he
had
sold
eighteen
books
which
far
exceeded
even
his
most
sanguine
expectations
by
this
time
he
began
to
feel
the
want
of
his
dinner
but
there
was
no
tavern
or
eating
house
at
hand
and
he
could
not
think
of
leaving
the
harvest
to
return
to
the
railroad
station
so
he
bought
a
sheet
of
gingerbread
and
a
piece
of
cheese
at
a
store
and
seating
himself
near
a
brook
by
the
side
of
the
road
he
bolted
his
simple
meal
as
boys
are
very
apt
to
do
when
they
are
excited
when
he
had
finished
he
took
out
his
account
book
and
entered
dinner
cents
resuming
his
business
he
disposed
of
the
remaining
six
books
in
his
valise
by
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
and
was
obliged
to
return
for
another
supply
about
six
he
entered
the
house
of
a
mechanic
just
as
the
family
were
sitting
down
to
tea
he
recommended
his
book
with
so
much
energy
that
the
wife
of
the
mechanic
took
a
fancy
to
him
and
not
only
purchased
one
but
invited
him
to
tea
bobby
accepted
the
invitation
and
in
the
course
of
the
meal
the
good
lady
drew
from
him
the
details
of
his
history
which
he
very
modestly
related
for
though
he
sometimes
fancied
himself
a
man
he
was
not
the
boy
to
boast
of
his
exploits
his
host
was
so
much
pleased
with
him
that
he
begged
him
to
spend
the
night
with
them
bobby
had
been
thinking
how
and
where
he
should
spend
the
night
and
the
matter
had
given
him
no
little
concern
he
did
not
wish
to
go
to
the
hotel
for
it
looked
like
a
very
smart
house
and
he
reasoned
that
he
should
have
to
pay
pretty
roundly
for
accommodations
there
these
high
prices
would
eat
up
his
profits
and
he
seriously
deliberated
whether
it
would
not
be
better
for
him
to
sleep
under
a
tree
than
pay
fifty
cents
for
a
lodging
if
i
had
been
there
i
should
have
told
him
that
a
man
loses
nothing
in
the
long
run
by
taking
good
care
of
himself
he
must
eat
well
and
sleep
well
in
order
to
do
well
and
be
well
but
i
suppose
bobby
would
have
told
me
that
it
was
of
no
use
to
pay
a
quarter
extra
for
sleeping
on
a
gilded
bedstead
since
the
room
would
be
so
dark
he
could
not
see
the
gilt
even
if
he
wished
to
do
so
i
could
not
have
said
anything
to
such
a
powerful
argument
so
i
am
very
glad
the
mechanic
wife
set
the
matter
at
rest
by
offering
him
a
bed
in
her
house
he
spent
a
very
pleasant
evening
with
the
family
who
made
him
feel
entirely
at
home
they
were
so
kind
and
so
plain
spoken
before
he
went
to
bed
he
entered
under
the
book
account
by
sold
this
day
he
had
done
a
big
day
work
much
bigger
than
he
could
hope
to
do
again
he
had
sold
more
than
one
half
of
his
whole
stock
and
at
this
rate
he
should
be
out
of
books
the
next
day
at
first
he
thought
he
would
send
for
another
lot
but
he
could
not
judge
yet
what
his
average
daily
sales
would
be
and
finally
concluded
not
to
do
so
what
he
had
might
last
till
friday
or
saturday
he
intended
to
go
home
on
the
latter
day
and
he
could
bring
them
with
him
on
his
return
without
expense
this
was
considerable
of
an
argument
for
a
boy
to
manage
but
bobby
was
satisfied
with
it
and
went
to
sleep
wondering
what
his
mother
squire
lee
and
annie
were
thinking
of
about
that
time
after
breakfast
the
next
morning
he
resumed
his
travels
he
was
as
enthusiastic
as
ever
and
pressed
the
wayfarer
with
so
much
earnestness
that
he
sold
a
book
in
nearly
every
house
he
visited
people
seemed
to
be
more
interested
in
the
little
merchant
than
in
his
stock
and
taking
advantage
of
this
kind
feeling
towards
him
he
appealed
to
them
with
so
much
eloquence
that
few
could
resist
it
the
result
of
the
day
sales
was
fifteen
copies
which
bobby
entered
in
the
book
account
with
the
most
intense
satisfaction
he
had
outdone
the
boy
who
had
passed
through
riverdale
but
he
had
little
hope
that
the
harvest
would
always
be
so
abundant
he
often
thought
of
this
boy
from
whom
he
had
obtained
the
idea
he
was
now
carrying
out
that
boy
had
stopped
over
night
at
the
little
black
house
and
slept
with
him
he
had
asked
for
lodging
and
offered
to
pay
for
it
as
well
as
for
his
supper
and
breakfast
why
he
do
the
same
he
liked
the
suggestion
and
from
that
time
wherever
he
happened
to
be
he
asked
for
lodging
or
the
meal
he
required
and
he
always
proposed
to
pay
for
what
he
had
but
very
few
would
take
anything
on
friday
noon
he
had
sold
out
returning
to
the
railroad
station
he
found
that
the
train
would
not
leave
for
the
city
for
an
hour
so
he
improved
the
time
in
examining
and
balancing
his
accounts
the
book
sales
amounted
to
just
fifty
dollars
and
after
his
ticket
to
boston
was
paid
for
his
expenses
would
amount
to
one
dollar
and
fifty
cents
leaving
a
balance
in
his
favor
of
fifteen
dollars
he
was
overjoyed
with
the
result
and
pictured
the
astonishment
with
which
his
mother
squire
lee
and
annie
would
listen
to
the
history
of
his
excursion
after
four
that
afternoon
he
entered
the
store
of
bayard
bag
and
baggage
on
his
arrival
in
the
city
he
was
considerably
exercised
in
mind
to
know
how
he
should
get
the
trunk
to
his
destination
he
was
too
economical
to
pay
a
cartman
a
quarter
but
what
would
have
seemed
mean
in
a
man
was
praiseworthy
in
a
boy
laboring
for
a
noble
end
probably
a
great
many
of
my
young
readers
in
bobby
position
thinking
that
sixteen
dollars
which
our
hero
had
in
his
pocket
was
a
mint
of
money
would
have
been
in
favor
of
being
a
little
magnificent
of
taking
a
carriage
and
going
in
state
bobby
had
not
the
least
desire
to
swell
so
he
settled
the
matter
by
bargaining
with
a
little
ragged
fellow
to
help
him
carry
the
trunk
to
bayard
store
for
fourpence
how
do
you
do
mr
timmins
said
bobby
to
the
spruce
clerk
as
he
deposited
the
trunk
upon
the
floor
and
handed
the
ragged
boy
the
fourpence
ah
bobby
exclaimed
timmins
have
you
sold
out
all
clean
is
bayard
in
in
the
office
but
how
do
you
like
it
first
rate
well
every
one
to
his
taste
but
i
do
see
how
any
one
who
has
any
regard
for
his
dignity
can
stick
himself
into
everybody
house
i
could
do
it
i
know
i
do
stand
for
the
dignity
ah
well
there
is
a
difference
in
folks
that
a
fact
replied
bobby
as
he
hurried
to
the
office
of
bayard
leaving
timmins
to
sun
himself
in
his
own
dignity
the
bookseller
was
surprised
to
see
him
so
soon
but
he
gave
him
a
cordial
reception
i
did
expect
you
yet
said
he
why
do
you
come
back
have
you
got
sick
of
the
business
sick
of
it
no
sir
what
have
you
come
back
for
then
sold
out
sir
sold
out
you
have
done
well
better
than
i
expected
i
had
no
idea
of
seeing
you
till
night
and
i
thought
you
would
have
books
enough
to
begin
the
next
week
with
you
have
done
bravely
if
i
had
had
twenty
more
i
could
have
sold
them
before
night
now
sir
if
you
please
i
will
pay
you
for
those
books
dollars
and
fifty
cents
you
had
better
keep
that
bobby
i
will
trust
you
as
long
as
you
wish
if
you
please
sir
i
had
rather
pay
it
and
the
little
merchant
as
proud
as
a
lord
handed
over
the
amount
i
like
your
way
of
doing
business
bobby
nothing
helps
a
credit
so
much
as
paying
promptly
now
tell
me
some
of
your
adventures
or
we
will
reserve
them
till
this
evening
for
i
am
sure
ellen
will
be
delighted
to
hear
them
i
think
i
shall
go
to
riverdale
this
afternoon
the
cars
leave
at
half
past
five
very
well
you
have
an
hour
to
spare
bobby
related
to
his
kind
friend
the
incidents
of
his
excursion
including
his
interview
with
colonel
whiting
and
his
niece
which
amused
the
bookseller
very
much
he
volunteered
some
good
advice
which
bobby
received
in
the
right
spirit
and
with
a
determination
to
profit
by
it
at
half
past
five
he
took
the
cars
for
home
and
before
dark
was
folded
in
his
mother
arms
the
little
black
house
seemed
doubly
dear
to
him
now
that
he
had
been
away
from
it
a
few
days
his
mother
and
all
the
children
were
so
glad
to
see
him
that
it
seemed
almost
worth
his
while
to
go
away
for
the
pleasure
of
meeting
them
on
his
return
chapter
xii
in
which
bobby
astonishes
sundry
persons
and
pays
part
of
his
note
now
tell
me
bobby
how
you
have
made
out
said
mrs
bright
as
the
little
merchant
seated
himself
at
the
supper
table
you
can
not
have
done
much
for
you
have
only
been
gone
five
days
i
have
done
pretty
well
mother
replied
bobby
mysteriously
pretty
well
considering
that
i
am
only
a
boy
i
did
expect
to
see
you
till
night
i
sold
out
and
had
to
come
home
that
may
be
and
still
you
may
not
have
done
much
i
do
pretend
that
i
have
done
much
how
provoking
you
are
why
do
you
tell
me
bobby
what
you
have
done
wait
a
minute
mother
till
i
have
done
my
supper
and
then
i
will
show
you
the
footings
in
my
ledger
your
ledger
yes
my
ledger
i
keep
a
ledger
now
you
are
a
great
man
robert
bright
laughed
his
mother
i
suppose
the
people
took
their
hats
off
when
they
saw
you
coming
not
exactly
mother
perhaps
the
governor
came
out
to
meet
you
when
he
heard
you
were
on
the
road
perhaps
he
did
i
did
see
him
however
this
apple
pie
tastes
natural
mother
it
is
a
great
luxury
to
get
home
after
one
has
been
travelling
very
likely
no
place
like
home
after
all
is
done
and
said
who
was
the
fellow
that
wrote
that
song
mother
i
forget
the
paper
said
he
spent
a
great
many
years
in
foreign
parts
my
sake
bobby
one
would
think
by
your
talk
that
you
had
been
away
from
home
for
a
year
it
seems
like
a
year
said
he
as
he
transferred
another
quarter
of
the
famous
apple
pie
to
his
plate
i
miss
home
very
much
i
more
than
half
like
being
among
strangers
so
much
it
is
your
own
choice
no
one
wants
you
to
go
away
from
home
i
must
pay
my
debts
anyhow
do
i
owe
squire
lee
sixty
dollars
but
i
can
pay
that
it
is
my
affair
you
see
if
it
is
your
affair
then
i
owe
you
sixty
dollars
no
you
do
i
calculate
to
pay
my
board
now
i
am
old
enough
and
big
enough
to
do
something
you
have
done
something
ever
since
you
were
old
enough
to
work
not
much
i
do
wonder
that
miserable
old
hunker
of
a
hardhand
twitted
me
about
it
by
the
way
have
you
heard
anything
from
him
not
a
thing
he
has
got
enough
of
us
i
reckon
you
must
insult
him
bobby
if
you
happen
to
see
him
never
fear
me
you
know
the
bible
says
we
must
love
our
enemies
and
pray
for
them
that
despitefully
use
us
and
persecute
us
i
should
pray
that
the
old
nick
might
get
him
no
bobby
i
hope
you
have
forgot
all
your
sunday
school
lessons
i
was
wrong
mother
replied
bobby
a
little
moved
i
did
not
mean
so
i
shall
try
to
think
as
well
of
him
as
i
can
but
i
ca
help
thinking
if
all
the
world
was
like
him
what
a
desperate
hard
time
we
should
have
of
it
we
must
thank
the
lord
that
he
has
given
us
so
many
good
and
true
men
such
as
squire
lee
for
instance
added
bobby
as
he
rose
from
the
table
and
put
his
chair
back
against
the
wall
the
squire
is
fit
to
be
a
king
and
though
i
believe
in
the
constitution
and
the
declaration
of
independence
i
would
mind
seeing
a
crown
upon
his
head
he
will
receive
his
crown
in
due
time
replied
mrs
bright
piously
the
squire
the
crown
of
rejoicing
i
mean
just
so
the
squire
is
a
nice
man
and
i
know
another
just
like
him
who
bayard
they
are
as
near
alike
as
two
peas
i
am
dying
to
know
about
your
journey
wait
a
minute
mother
till
we
clear
away
the
supper
things
and
bobby
took
hold
as
he
had
been
accustomed
to
help
remove
and
wash
the
dishes
you
need
help
now
bobby
yes
i
will
mother
somehow
our
hero
visit
to
the
city
did
not
seem
to
produce
the
usual
effect
upon
him
for
a
great
many
boys
after
they
had
been
abroad
would
have
scorned
to
wash
dishes
and
wipe
them
a
week
in
town
has
made
many
a
boy
so
smart
that
you
could
touch
him
with
a
ten
foot
pole
it
starches
them
up
so
stiff
that
sometimes
they
do
know
their
own
mothers
and
deem
it
a
piece
of
condescension
to
speak
a
word
to
the
patriarch
in
a
blue
frock
who
had
the
honor
of
supporting
them
in
childhood
bobby
was
none
of
this
sort
we
lament
that
he
had
a
habit
of
talking
big
that
is
of
talking
about
business
affairs
in
a
style
a
little
beyond
his
years
but
he
was
modest
to
a
fault
paradoxical
as
it
may
seem
he
was
always
blushing
when
anybody
spoke
a
pretty
thing
about
him
probably
the
circumstances
of
his
position
elevated
him
above
the
sphere
of
the
mere
boy
he
had
spent
but
little
time
in
play
and
his
attention
had
been
directed
at
all
times
to
the
wants
of
his
mother
he
had
thought
a
great
deal
about
business
especially
since
the
visit
of
the
boy
who
sold
books
to
the
little
black
house
some
boys
are
born
merchants
and
from
their
earliest
youth
have
a
genius
for
trade
they
think
of
little
else
they
play
shop
before
they
wear
jackets
and
drive
a
barter
trade
in
jackknives
whistles
tops
and
fishing
lines
long
before
they
get
into
their
teens
they
are
shrewd
even
then
and
obtain
a
taste
for
commerce
before
they
are
old
enough
to
know
the
meaning
of
the
word
we
saw
a
boy
in
school
not
long
since
give
the
value
of
eighteen
cents
for
a
little
stunted
quince
boys
have
a
taste
for
raw
quinces
strange
as
it
may
seem
undoubtedly
he
had
no
talent
for
trade
and
would
make
a
very
indifferent
tin
pedler
our
hero
was
shrewd
he
always
got
the
best
end
of
the
bargain
though
i
am
happy
to
say
his
integrity
was
too
unyielding
to
let
him
cheat
his
fellows
we
have
made
this
digression
so
that
my
young
readers
may
know
why
bobby
was
so
much
given
to
big
talk
the
desire
to
do
something
worthy
of
a
good
son
turned
his
attention
to
matters
above
his
sphere
and
thinking
of
great
things
he
had
come
to
talk
great
things
it
was
not
a
bad
fault
after
all
boys
need
not
necessarily
be
frivolous
play
is
a
good
thing
an
excellent
thing
in
its
place
and
is
as
much
a
part
of
the
boy
education
as
his
grammar
and
arithmetic
it
not
only
develops
his
muscles
but
enlarges
his
mental
capacity
it
not
only
fills
with
excitement
the
idle
hours
of
the
long
day
but
it
sharpens
the
judgment
and
helps
to
fit
the
boy
for
the
active
duties
of
life
it
need
not
be
supposed
because
bobby
had
to
turn
his
attention
to
serious
things
that
he
was
not
fond
of
fun
that
he
could
not
or
did
not
play
at
a
game
of
round
ball
he
was
a
lucky
fellow
who
secured
him
upon
his
side
for
the
same
energy
which
made
him
a
useful
son
rendered
him
a
desirable
hand
in
a
difficult
game
when
the
supper
things
were
all
removed
the
dishes
washed
and
put
away
bobby
drew
out
his
pocket
memorandum
book
it
was
a
beautiful
article
and
mrs
bright
was
duly
astonished
at
its
gilded
leaves
and
the
elegant
workmanship
very
likely
her
first
impulse
was
to
reprove
her
son
for
such
a
piece
of
reckless
extravagance
but
this
matter
was
set
right
by
bobby
informing
her
how
it
came
into
his
possession
here
is
my
ledger
mother
he
said
handing
her
the
book
mrs
bright
put
on
her
spectacles
and
after
bestowing
a
careful
scrutiny
upon
the
memorandum
book
turned
to
the
accounts
fifty
books
she
exclaimed
as
she
read
the
first
entry
yes
mother
and
i
sold
them
all
fifty
dollars
but
i
had
to
pay
for
the
books
out
of
that
to
be
sure
you
had
but
i
suppose
you
made
as
much
as
ten
cents
apiece
on
them
and
that
would
be
let
me
see
ten
times
fifty
but
i
made
more
than
that
i
hope
how
much
the
proud
young
merchant
referred
her
to
the
profit
and
loss
account
which
exhibited
a
balance
of
fifteen
dollars
gracious
three
dollars
a
day
just
so
mother
now
i
will
pay
you
the
dollar
i
borrowed
of
you
when
i
went
away
you
did
borrow
it
of
me
but
i
shall
pay
it
mrs
bright
was
astonished
at
this
unexpected
and
gratifying
result
if
she
had
discovered
a
gold
mine
in
the
cellar
of
the
little
black
house
it
could
not
have
afforded
her
so
much
satisfaction
for
this
money
was
the
reward
of
her
son
talent
and
energy
her
own
earnings
scarcely
ever
amounted
to
more
than
three
or
four
dollars
a
week
and
bobby
a
boy
of
thirteen
had
come
home
with
fifteen
for
five
days
work
she
could
scarcely
believe
the
evidence
of
her
own
senses
and
she
ceased
to
wonder
that
he
talked
big
it
was
nearly
ten
when
the
widow
and
her
son
went
to
bed
so
deeply
were
they
interested
in
discussing
our
hero
affairs
he
had
intended
to
call
upon
squire
lee
that
night
but
the
time
passed
away
so
rapidly
that
he
was
obliged
to
defer
it
till
the
next
day
after
breakfast
the
following
morning
he
hastened
to
pay
the
intended
visit
there
was
a
tumult
of
strange
emotions
in
his
bosom
as
he
knocked
at
the
squire
door
he
was
proud
of
the
success
he
had
achieved
and
even
then
his
cheek
burned
under
the
anticipated
commendations
which
his
generous
friend
would
bestow
upon
him
besides
annie
would
be
glad
to
see
him
for
she
had
expressed
such
a
desire
when
they
parted
on
the
monday
preceding
i
do
think
that
bobby
cherished
any
silly
ideas
but
the
sympathy
of
the
little
maiden
fell
not
coldly
or
unwelcomely
upon
his
warm
heart
in
coming
from
the
house
he
had
placed
his
copy
of
the
wayfarer
under
his
arm
for
annie
was
fond
of
reading
and
on
the
way
over
he
had
pictured
to
himself
the
pleasure
she
would
derive
from
reading
book
of
course
he
received
a
warm
welcome
from
the
squire
and
his
daughter
each
of
them
had
bestowed
more
than
a
thought
upon
the
little
wanderer
as
he
went
from
house
to
house
and
more
than
once
they
had
conversed
together
about
him
well
bobby
how
is
trade
in
the
book
line
asked
the
squire
after
the
young
pilgrim
had
been
cordially
greeted
pretty
fair
replied
bobby
with
as
much
indifference
as
he
could
command
though
it
was
hard
even
to
seem
indifferent
then
and
there
where
have
you
been
travelling
in
b
fine
place
books
sell
well
there
very
well
in
fact
i
sold
out
all
my
stock
by
noon
yesterday
how
many
books
did
you
carry
fifty
you
did
well
i
should
think
you
did
added
annie
with
an
enthusiasm
which
quite
upset
all
bobby
assumed
indifference
fifty
books
yes
miss
annie
and
i
have
brought
you
a
copy
of
the
book
i
have
been
selling
i
thought
you
would
like
to
read
it
it
is
a
splendid
work
and
will
be
book
of
the
season
i
shall
be
delighted
to
read
it
replied
annie
taking
the
proffered
volume
it
looks
real
good
she
continued
as
she
turned
over
the
leaves
it
is
first
rate
i
have
read
it
through
it
was
very
kind
of
you
to
think
of
me
when
you
have
so
much
business
on
your
mind
added
she
with
a
roguish
smile
i
shall
never
have
so
much
business
on
my
mind
that
i
can
not
think
of
my
friends
replied
bobby
so
gallantly
and
so
smartly
that
it
astonished
himself
i
was
just
thinking
what
i
should
read
next
i
am
glad
you
have
come
never
mind
her
bobby
all
she
wanted
was
the
book
interposed
squire
lee
laughing
now
pa
then
i
shall
bring
her
one
very
often
you
are
too
bad
pa
said
annie
who
like
most
young
ladies
just
entering
their
teens
resented
any
imputation
upon
the
immaculateness
of
human
love
or
human
friendship
i
have
got
a
little
money
for
you
squire
lee
continued
bobby
thinking
it
time
the
subject
was
changed
he
took
out
his
gilded
memorandum
book
whose
elegant
appearance
rather
startled
the
squire
and
from
its
treasury
department
extracted
the
little
roll
of
bills
representing
an
aggregate
of
ten
dollars
which
he
had
carefully
reserved
for
his
creditor
never
mind
that
bobby
replied
the
squire
you
will
want
all
your
capital
to
do
business
with
i
must
pay
my
debts
before
i
think
of
anything
else
a
very
good
plan
bobby
but
this
is
an
exception
to
the
general
rule
no
sir
i
think
not
if
you
please
i
insist
upon
paying
you
ten
dollars
on
my
note
o
well
if
you
insist
i
suppose
i
ca
help
myself
i
would
rather
pay
it
i
shall
feel
so
much
better
you
want
to
indorse
it
on
the
note
i
suppose
that
was
just
what
bobby
wanted
indorsed
on
the
note
was
the
idea
and
our
hero
had
often
passed
that
expression
through
his
mind
there
was
something
gratifying
in
the
act
to
a
man
of
business
integrity
like
himself
it
was
discharging
a
sacred
obligation
he
had
already
come
to
deem
it
a
sacred
duty
to
pay
one
debts
and
as
the
squire
wrote
the
indorsement
across
the
back
of
the
note
he
felt
more
like
a
hero
than
ever
before
as
you
go
is
an
excellent
idea
john
randolph
called
it
the
philosopher
stone
added
squire
lee
as
he
returned
the
note
to
his
pocket
book
that
is
what
i
mean
to
do
just
as
soon
as
i
can
you
will
do
bobby
the
young
merchant
spent
nearly
the
whole
forenoon
at
the
squire
and
declined
an
invitation
to
dinner
only
on
the
plea
that
his
mother
would
wait
for
him
chapter
xiii
in
which
bobby
declines
a
copartnership
and
visits
b
again
after
dinner
bobby
performed
his
saturday
afternoon
chores
as
usual
he
split
wood
enough
to
last
for
a
week
so
that
his
mother
might
not
miss
him
too
much
and
then
feeling
a
desire
to
visit
his
favorite
resorts
in
the
vicinity
he
concluded
to
go
a
fishing
the
day
was
favorable
the
sky
being
overcast
and
the
wind
very
light
after
digging
a
little
box
of
worms
in
the
garden
back
of
the
house
he
shouldered
his
fish
pole
and
certainly
no
one
would
have
suspected
that
he
was
a
distinguished
travelling
merchant
he
was
fond
of
fishing
and
it
is
a
remarkable
coincidence
that
daniel
webster
and
many
other
famous
men
have
manifested
a
decided
passion
for
this
exciting
sport
no
doubt
a
fondness
for
angling
is
a
peculiarity
of
genius
and
if
being
an
expert
fisherman
makes
a
great
man
then
our
hero
was
a
great
man
he
had
scarcely
seated
himself
on
his
favorite
rock
and
dropped
his
line
into
the
water
before
he
saw
tom
spicer
approaching
the
spot
the
bully
had
never
been
a
welcome
companion
there
was
no
sympathy
between
them
they
could
never
agree
for
their
views
opinions
and
tastes
were
always
conflicting
bobby
had
not
seen
tom
since
he
left
him
to
crawl
out
of
the
ditch
on
the
preceding
week
and
he
had
good
reason
to
believe
that
he
should
not
be
regarded
with
much
favor
tom
was
malicious
and
revengeful
and
our
hero
was
satisfied
that
the
blow
which
had
prostrated
him
in
the
ditch
would
not
be
forgotten
till
it
had
been
atoned
for
he
was
prepared
therefore
for
any
disagreeable
scene
which
might
occur
there
was
another
circumstance
also
which
rendered
the
presence
decidedly
unpleasant
at
this
time
an
event
that
had
occurred
during
his
absence
the
particulars
of
which
he
had
received
from
his
mother
tom
father
who
was
a
poor
man
and
addicted
to
intemperance
had
lost
ten
dollars
he
had
brought
it
home
and
as
he
affirmed
placed
it
in
one
of
the
bureau
drawers
the
next
day
it
could
not
be
found
spicer
for
some
reason
was
satisfied
that
tom
had
taken
it
but
the
boy
stoutly
and
persistently
denied
it
no
money
was
found
upon
him
however
and
it
did
not
appear
that
he
had
spent
any
at
the
stores
in
riverdale
centre
the
affair
created
some
excitement
in
the
vicinity
for
spicer
made
no
secret
of
his
suspicions
and
publicly
accused
tom
of
the
theft
he
did
not
get
much
sympathy
from
any
except
his
pot
companions
for
there
was
no
evidence
but
his
bare
and
unsupported
statement
to
substantiate
the
grave
accusation
tom
had
been
in
the
room
when
the
money
was
placed
in
the
drawer
and
as
his
father
asserted
had
watched
him
closely
while
he
deposited
the
bills
under
the
clothing
no
one
else
could
have
taken
it
these
were
the
proofs
but
people
generally
believed
that
spicer
had
carried
no
money
home
especially
as
it
was
known
that
he
was
intoxicated
on
the
night
in
question
and
that
the
alleged
theft
was
only
a
ruse
to
satisfy
certain
importunate
creditors
everybody
knew
that
tom
was
bad
enough
to
steal
even
from
his
father
from
which
my
readers
can
understand
that
it
is
an
excellent
thing
to
have
a
good
reputation
bobby
knew
that
he
would
lie
and
use
profane
language
that
he
spent
his
sundays
by
the
river
or
in
roaming
through
the
woods
and
that
he
played
truant
from
school
as
often
as
the
fear
of
the
rod
would
permit
and
the
boy
that
would
do
all
these
things
certainly
would
steal
if
he
got
a
good
chance
our
judgment
therefore
of
the
case
was
not
favorable
to
the
bully
and
he
would
have
thanked
him
to
stay
away
from
the
river
while
he
was
there
hallo
bob
how
are
you
shouted
tom
when
he
had
come
within
hailing
distance
very
well
replied
bobby
rather
coolly
been
to
boston
they
say
yes
well
how
did
you
like
it
continued
tom
as
he
seated
himself
on
the
rock
near
our
hero
first
rate
been
to
work
there
no
what
have
you
been
doing
travelling
about
what
doing
selling
books
was
you
though
did
you
sell
any
yes
a
few
how
many
o
about
fifty
you
did
though
did
you
how
much
did
you
make
about
fifteen
dollars
by
jolly
you
are
a
smart
one
bobby
there
are
not
many
fellows
that
would
have
done
that
easy
enough
replied
bobby
who
was
not
a
little
surprised
at
this
warm
commendation
from
one
whom
he
regarded
as
his
enemy
you
had
to
buy
the
books
first
did
you
asked
tom
who
began
to
manifest
a
deep
interest
in
the
trade
of
course
no
one
will
give
you
the
books
what
do
you
pay
for
them
i
buy
them
so
as
to
make
a
profit
on
them
answered
bobby
who
like
a
discreet
merchant
was
not
disposed
to
be
too
communicative
that
business
would
suit
me
first
rate
it
is
pretty
hard
work
i
do
care
for
that
do
you
believe
i
could
do
something
in
this
line
i
do
know
perhaps
you
could
why
not
as
well
as
you
this
was
a
hard
question
and
as
bobby
did
not
wish
to
be
uncivil
he
talked
about
a
big
pout
he
hauled
in
at
that
moment
instead
of
answering
it
he
was
politic
and
deprecated
the
anger
of
the
bully
so
though
tom
plied
him
pretty
hard
he
did
not
receive
much
satisfaction
you
see
tom
said
he
when
he
found
that
his
companion
insisted
upon
knowing
the
cost
of
the
books
this
is
a
publisher
secret
and
i
dare
say
they
would
not
wish
every
one
to
know
the
cost
of
books
we
sell
them
for
a
dollar
apiece
humph
you
need
be
so
close
about
it
i
bet
i
can
find
out
i
have
no
doubt
you
can
only
you
see
i
do
want
to
tell
what
i
am
not
sure
they
would
be
willing
i
should
tell
tom
took
a
slate
pencil
from
his
pocket
and
commenced
ciphering
on
the
smooth
rock
upon
which
he
sat
you
say
you
sold
fifty
books
yes
well
if
you
made
fifteen
dollars
out
of
fifty
that
is
thirty
cents
apiece
bobby
was
a
little
mortified
when
he
perceived
that
he
had
unwittingly
exposed
the
momentous
secret
he
had
not
given
tom
credit
for
so
much
sagacity
as
he
had
displayed
in
his
inquiries
and
as
he
had
fairly
reached
his
conclusion
he
was
willing
he
should
have
the
benefit
of
it
you
sold
them
at
a
dollar
apiece
thirty
from
a
hundred
leaves
seventy
they
cost
you
seventy
cents
each
did
they
replied
bobby
yielding
the
point
enough
said
bob
i
am
going
into
that
business
anyhow
i
am
willing
of
course
you
are
suppose
we
go
together
suggested
tom
who
had
not
used
all
this
conciliation
without
having
a
purpose
in
view
we
could
do
nothing
together
i
should
like
to
get
out
with
you
just
once
only
to
see
how
it
is
done
you
can
find
out
for
yourself
as
i
did
do
be
mean
bob
mean
i
am
not
mean
i
do
say
you
are
we
have
always
been
good
friends
you
know
bobby
did
not
know
it
so
he
looked
at
the
other
with
a
smile
which
expressed
all
he
meant
to
say
you
hit
me
a
smart
dig
the
other
day
i
know
but
i
do
mind
that
i
was
in
the
wrong
then
and
i
am
willing
to
own
it
continued
tom
with
an
appearance
of
humility
this
was
an
immense
concession
for
tom
to
make
and
bobby
was
duly
affected
by
it
probably
it
was
the
first
time
the
bully
had
ever
owned
he
was
in
the
wrong
the
fact
is
bob
i
always
liked
you
and
you
know
i
licked
ben
dowse
for
you
that
was
two
for
yourself
and
one
for
me
besides
i
did
want
ben
thrashed
but
he
deserved
it
did
he
tell
the
master
you
were
whispering
in
school
i
was
whispering
so
he
told
the
truth
it
was
mean
to
blow
on
a
fellow
though
the
master
asked
him
if
i
whispered
to
him
of
course
he
ought
not
to
lie
about
it
but
he
told
of
you
at
the
same
time
i
know
it
but
i
would
have
licked
him
on
my
own
account
you
would
i
know
i
would
but
i
say
bobby
where
do
you
buy
your
books
at
bayard
in
washington
street
he
will
sell
them
to
me
at
the
same
price
wo
he
i
do
know
when
are
you
going
again
monday
wo
you
let
me
go
with
you
bob
let
you
of
course
you
can
go
where
you
please
it
is
none
of
my
business
bobby
did
not
like
the
idea
of
having
such
a
copartner
as
tom
spicer
and
he
did
not
like
to
tell
him
so
if
he
did
he
would
have
to
give
his
reasons
for
declining
the
proposition
and
that
would
make
tom
mad
and
perhaps
provoke
him
to
quarrel
the
fish
bit
well
and
in
an
hour
time
bobby
had
a
mess
as
he
took
his
basket
and
walked
home
the
young
ruffian
followed
him
he
could
not
get
rid
of
him
till
he
reached
the
gate
in
front
of
the
little
black
house
and
even
there
tom
begged
him
to
stop
a
few
moments
our
hero
was
in
a
hurry
and
in
the
easiest
manner
possible
got
rid
of
this
aspirant
for
mercantile
honors
we
have
no
doubt
a
journal
of
bobby
daily
life
would
be
very
interesting
to
our
young
readers
but
the
fact
that
some
of
his
most
stirring
adventures
are
yet
to
be
related
admonishes
us
to
hasten
forward
more
rapidly
on
monday
morning
bobby
bade
adieu
to
his
mother
again
and
started
for
boston
he
fully
expected
to
encounter
tom
on
the
way
who
he
was
afraid
would
persist
in
accompanying
him
on
his
tour
as
before
he
stopped
at
squire
lee
to
bid
him
and
annie
good
by
the
little
maiden
had
read
the
wayfarer
more
than
half
through
and
was
very
enthusiastic
in
her
expression
of
the
pleasure
she
derived
from
it
she
promised
to
send
it
over
to
his
house
when
she
had
finished
it
and
hoped
he
would
bring
his
stock
to
riverdale
so
that
she
might
again
replenish
her
library
bobby
thought
of
something
just
then
and
the
thought
brought
forth
a
harvest
on
the
following
saturday
when
he
returned
when
he
had
shaken
hands
with
the
squire
and
was
about
to
depart
he
received
a
piece
of
news
which
gave
him
food
for
an
hour
serious
reflection
did
you
hear
about
tom
spicer
asked
squire
lee
no
sir
what
about
him
broken
his
arm
broken
his
arm
gracious
how
did
it
happen
exclaimed
bobby
the
more
astonished
because
he
had
been
thinking
of
tom
since
he
had
left
home
he
was
out
in
the
woods
yesterday
where
boys
should
not
be
on
sundays
and
in
climbing
a
tree
after
a
bird
nest
he
fell
to
the
ground
i
am
sorry
for
him
replied
bobby
musing
so
am
i
but
if
he
had
been
at
home
or
at
church
where
he
should
have
been
it
would
not
have
happened
if
i
had
any
boys
i
would
lock
them
up
in
their
chambers
if
i
could
not
keep
them
at
home
sundays
poor
tom
mused
bobby
recalling
the
conversation
he
had
had
with
him
on
saturday
and
then
wishing
that
he
had
been
a
little
more
pliant
with
him
it
is
too
bad
but
i
must
say
i
am
more
sorry
for
his
poor
mother
than
i
am
for
him
added
the
squire
however
i
hope
it
will
do
him
good
and
be
a
lesson
he
will
remember
as
long
as
he
lives
bobby
bade
the
squire
and
annie
adieu
again
resumed
his
journey
towards
the
railroad
station
his
thoughts
were
busy
with
tom
case
the
reason
why
he
had
not
joined
him
as
he
expected
and
feared
he
would
was
now
apparent
he
pitied
him
for
he
realized
that
he
must
endure
a
great
deal
of
pain
before
he
could
again
go
out
but
he
finally
dismissed
the
matter
with
the
squire
sage
reflection
that
he
hoped
the
calamity
would
be
a
good
lesson
to
him
the
young
merchant
did
not
walk
to
boston
this
time
for
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
in
the
six
hours
it
would
take
him
to
travel
to
the
city
on
foot
the
profit
on
the
books
he
could
sell
would
be
more
than
enough
to
pay
his
fare
to
say
nothing
of
the
fatigue
and
the
expense
of
shoe
leather
before
noon
he
was
at
b
again
as
busy
as
ever
in
driving
his
business
the
experience
of
the
former
week
was
of
great
value
to
him
he
visited
people
belonging
to
all
spheres
in
society
and
though
he
was
occasionally
repulsed
or
treated
with
incivility
he
was
not
conscious
in
a
single
instance
of
offending
any
person
sense
of
propriety
he
was
not
as
fortunate
as
during
the
previous
week
and
it
was
saturday
noon
before
he
had
sold
out
the
sixty
books
he
carried
with
him
the
net
profit
for
this
week
was
fourteen
dollars
with
which
he
was
abundantly
pleased
bayard
again
commended
him
in
the
warmest
terms
for
his
zeal
and
promptness
timmins
was
even
more
civil
than
the
last
time
and
when
bobby
asked
the
price
of
moore
poems
he
actually
offered
to
sell
it
to
him
for
per
cent
less
than
the
retail
price
the
little
merchant
was
on
the
point
of
purchasing
it
when
bayard
inquired
what
he
wanted
i
am
going
to
buy
this
book
replied
bobby
moore
poems
yes
sir
bayard
took
from
a
glass
case
an
elegantly
bound
copy
of
the
same
work
morocco
full
gilt
and
handed
it
to
our
hero
i
shall
make
you
a
present
of
this
are
you
an
admirer
of
moore
no
sir
not
exactly
that
is
i
do
know
much
about
it
but
annie
lee
does
and
i
want
to
get
the
book
for
her
bobby
cheeks
reddened
as
he
turned
the
leaves
of
the
beautiful
volume
putting
his
head
down
to
the
page
to
hide
his
confusion
annie
lee
said
bayard
with
a
quizzing
smile
i
see
how
it
is
rather
young
bobby
her
father
has
been
very
good
to
me
and
to
my
mother
and
so
has
annie
for
that
matter
squire
lee
would
be
a
great
deal
more
pleased
if
i
should
make
annie
a
present
than
if
i
made
him
one
i
feel
grateful
to
him
and
i
want
to
let
it
out
somehow
that
right
bobby
always
remember
your
friends
timmins
wrap
up
this
book
bobby
protested
with
all
his
might
but
the
bookseller
insisted
that
he
should
give
annie
this
beautiful
edition
and
he
was
obliged
to
yield
the
point
that
evening
he
was
at
the
little
black
house
again
and
his
mother
examined
his
ledger
with
a
great
deal
of
pride
and
satisfaction
that
evening
too
another
ten
dollars
was
indorsed
on
the
note
and
annie
received
that
elegant
copy
of
moore
poems
chapter
xiv
in
which
bobby
air
castle
is
upset
and
tom
spicer
takes
to
the
woods
during
the
next
four
weeks
bobby
visited
various
places
in
the
vicinity
of
boston
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
had
paid
the
whole
of
the
debt
he
owed
squire
lee
he
had
the
note
in
his
memorandum
book
and
the
fact
that
he
had
achieved
his
first
great
purpose
afforded
him
much
satisfaction
now
he
owed
no
man
anything
and
he
felt
as
though
he
could
hold
up
his
head
among
the
best
people
in
the
world
the
little
black
house
was
paid
for
and
bobby
was
proud
that
his
own
exertions
had
released
his
mother
from
her
obligation
to
her
hard
creditor
hardhand
could
no
longer
insult
and
abuse
her
the
apparent
results
which
bobby
had
accomplished
however
were
as
nothing
compared
with
the
real
results
he
had
developed
those
energies
of
character
which
were
to
make
him
not
only
a
great
business
man
but
a
useful
member
of
society
besides
there
was
a
moral
grandeur
in
his
humble
achievements
which
was
more
worthy
of
consideration
than
the
mere
worldly
success
he
had
obtained
motives
determine
the
character
of
deeds
that
a
boy
of
thirteen
should
display
so
much
enterprise
and
energy
was
a
great
thing
but
that
it
should
be
displayed
from
pure
unselfish
devotion
to
his
mother
was
a
vastly
greater
thing
many
great
achievements
are
morally
insignificant
while
many
of
which
the
world
never
hears
mark
the
true
hero
our
hero
was
not
satisfied
with
what
he
had
done
and
far
from
relinquishing
his
interesting
and
profitable
employment
his
ambition
suggested
new
and
wider
fields
of
success
as
one
ideal
brilliant
and
glorious
in
its
time
was
reached
another
more
brilliant
and
more
glorious
presented
itself
and
demanded
to
be
achieved
the
little
black
house
began
to
appear
rusty
and
inconvenient
a
coat
of
white
paint
would
marvellously
improve
its
appearance
a
set
of
nice
blinds
would
make
a
palace
of
it
and
a
neat
fence
around
it
would
positively
transform
the
place
into
a
paradise
yet
bobby
was
audacious
enough
to
think
of
these
things
and
even
to
promise
himself
that
they
should
be
obtained
in
conversation
with
bayard
a
few
days
before
that
gentleman
had
suggested
a
new
field
of
labor
and
it
had
been
arranged
that
bobby
should
visit
the
state
of
maine
the
following
week
on
the
banks
of
the
kennebec
were
many
wealthy
and
important
towns
where
the
intelligence
of
the
people
created
a
demand
for
books
this
time
the
little
merchant
was
to
take
two
hundred
books
and
be
absent
until
they
were
all
sold
on
monday
morning
he
started
bright
and
early
for
the
railroad
station
as
usual
he
called
upon
squire
lee
and
informed
annie
that
he
should
probably
be
absent
three
or
four
weeks
she
hoped
no
accident
would
happen
to
him
and
that
his
journey
would
be
crowned
with
success
without
being
sentimental
she
was
a
little
sad
for
bobby
was
a
great
friend
of
hers
that
elegant
copy
of
moore
poems
had
been
gratefully
received
and
she
was
so
fond
of
the
beautiful
and
touching
melodies
that
she
could
never
read
any
of
them
without
thinking
of
the
brave
little
fellow
who
had
given
her
the
volume
which
no
one
will
consider
very
remarkable
even
in
a
little
miss
of
twelve
after
he
had
bidden
her
and
her
father
adieu
he
resumed
his
journey
of
course
he
was
thinking
with
all
his
might
but
no
one
need
suppose
he
was
wondering
how
wide
the
kennebec
river
was
or
how
many
books
he
should
sell
in
the
towns
upon
its
banks
nothing
of
the
kind
though
it
is
enough
even
for
the
inquisitive
to
know
that
he
was
thinking
of
something
and
that
his
thoughts
were
very
interesting
not
to
say
romantic
hallo
bob
shouted
some
one
from
the
road
side
bobby
was
provoked
for
it
is
sometimes
very
uncomfortable
to
have
a
pleasant
train
of
thought
interrupted
the
imagination
is
buoyant
ethereal
and
elevates
poor
mortals
up
to
the
stars
sometimes
it
was
so
with
bobby
he
was
building
up
some
kind
of
an
air
castle
and
had
got
up
in
the
clouds
amidst
the
fog
and
moonshine
and
that
aggravating
voice
brought
him
down
upon
terra
firma
he
looked
up
and
saw
tom
spicer
seated
upon
the
fence
in
his
hand
he
held
a
bundle
and
had
evidently
been
waiting
some
time
for
coming
he
had
recovered
from
the
illness
caused
by
his
broken
arm
and
people
said
it
had
been
a
good
lesson
for
him
as
the
squire
hoped
it
would
be
bobby
had
called
upon
him
two
or
three
times
during
his
confinement
to
the
house
and
tom
either
truly
repentant
for
his
past
errors
or
lacking
the
opportunity
at
that
time
to
manifest
his
evil
propensities
had
stoutly
protested
that
he
had
turned
over
a
new
leaf
and
meant
to
keep
out
of
the
woods
on
sunday
stop
lying
and
swearing
and
become
a
good
boy
bobby
commended
his
good
resolutions
and
told
him
he
would
never
want
friends
while
he
was
true
to
himself
the
right
side
he
declared
was
always
the
best
side
he
quoted
several
instances
of
men
whose
lives
he
had
read
in
his
sunday
school
books
to
show
how
happy
a
good
man
may
be
in
prison
or
when
all
the
world
seemed
to
forsake
him
tom
assured
him
that
he
meant
to
reform
and
be
a
good
boy
and
bobby
told
him
that
when
any
one
meant
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
it
was
now
or
never
if
he
put
it
off
he
would
only
grow
worse
and
the
longer
the
good
work
was
delayed
the
more
difficult
it
would
be
to
do
it
tom
agreed
to
all
this
and
was
sure
he
had
reformed
for
these
reasons
bobby
had
come
to
regard
tom
with
a
feeling
of
deep
interest
he
considered
him
as
in
some
measure
his
disciple
and
he
felt
a
personal
responsibility
in
encouraging
him
to
persevere
in
his
good
work
nevertheless
bobby
was
not
exactly
pleased
to
have
his
fine
air
castle
upset
and
to
be
tipped
out
of
the
clouds
upon
the
cold
uncompromising
earth
again
so
the
first
greeting
he
gave
tom
was
not
as
cordial
as
it
might
have
been
hallo
tom
he
replied
rather
coolly
been
waiting
for
you
this
half
hour
have
you
yes
ai
you
rather
late
no
i
have
plenty
of
time
though
none
to
spare
answered
bobby
and
this
was
a
hint
that
he
must
not
detain
him
too
long
come
along
then
where
are
you
going
tom
asked
bobby
a
little
surprised
at
these
words
to
boston
are
you
i
am
that
a
fact
you
know
i
spoke
to
you
about
going
into
the
book
business
not
lately
but
i
have
been
thinking
about
it
all
the
time
what
do
your
father
and
mother
say
o
they
are
all
right
have
you
asked
them
certainly
i
have
they
are
willing
i
should
go
with
why
did
you
speak
of
it
then
i
thought
i
would
say
anything
till
the
time
came
you
know
you
fought
shy
when
i
spoke
about
it
before
and
bobby
notwithstanding
the
interest
he
felt
in
his
companion
was
a
little
disposed
to
fight
shy
now
tom
had
reformed
or
had
pretended
to
do
so
but
he
was
still
a
raw
recruit
and
our
hero
was
somewhat
fearful
that
he
would
run
at
the
first
fire
to
the
good
and
true
man
life
is
a
constant
battle
temptation
assails
him
at
almost
every
point
perils
and
snares
beset
him
at
every
step
of
his
mortal
pilgrimage
so
that
every
day
he
is
called
upon
to
gird
on
his
armor
and
fight
the
good
fight
bobby
was
no
poet
but
he
had
a
good
idea
of
this
strife
with
the
foes
of
error
and
sin
that
crossed
his
path
it
was
a
practical
conception
but
it
was
truly
expressed
under
the
similitude
of
a
battle
there
was
to
be
resistance
and
he
could
comprehend
that
for
his
bump
of
combativeness
took
cognizance
of
the
suggestion
he
was
to
fight
and
that
was
an
idea
that
stood
him
in
better
stead
than
a
whole
library
of
ethical
subtilties
judging
tom
by
his
own
standard
he
was
afraid
he
would
run
that
he
would
stand
fire
he
had
not
been
drilled
heretofore
when
temptation
beset
him
he
had
yielded
without
even
a
struggle
and
fled
from
the
field
without
firing
a
gun
to
go
out
into
the
great
world
was
a
trying
event
for
the
raw
recruit
he
lacked
too
that
prestige
of
success
which
is
worth
more
than
numbers
on
the
field
of
battle
tom
had
chosen
for
himself
and
he
could
not
send
him
back
he
had
taken
up
the
line
of
march
let
it
lead
him
where
it
might
march
on
in
legions
death
and
sin
impatient
wait
thy
conquering
hand
the
foe
without
the
foe
within
thy
youthful
arm
must
both
withstand
bobby
had
great
hopes
of
him
he
felt
that
he
could
not
well
get
rid
of
him
and
he
saw
that
it
was
policy
for
him
to
make
the
best
of
it
well
tom
where
are
you
going
asked
bobby
after
he
had
made
up
his
mind
not
to
object
to
the
companionship
of
the
other
i
do
know
you
have
been
a
good
friend
to
me
lately
and
i
had
an
idea
that
you
would
give
me
a
lift
in
this
business
i
should
be
very
willing
to
do
so
but
what
can
i
do
for
you
just
show
me
how
the
business
is
done
that
all
i
want
your
father
and
mother
were
willing
you
should
come
were
they
not
bobby
had
some
doubts
about
this
point
and
with
good
reason
too
he
had
called
at
tom
house
the
day
before
and
they
had
gone
to
church
together
but
neither
he
nor
his
parents
had
said
a
word
about
his
going
to
boston
when
did
they
agree
to
it
last
night
replied
tom
after
a
moment
hesitation
all
right
then
but
i
can
not
promise
you
that
bayard
will
let
you
have
the
books
i
can
fix
that
i
reckon
replied
tom
confidently
i
will
speak
a
good
word
for
you
at
any
rate
that
right
bob
i
am
going
down
into
the
state
of
maine
this
time
and
shall
be
gone
three
or
four
weeks
so
much
the
better
i
always
wanted
to
go
down
that
way
tom
asked
a
great
many
questions
about
the
business
and
the
method
of
travelling
which
bobby
superior
intelligence
and
more
extensive
experience
enabled
him
to
answer
to
the
entire
satisfaction
of
the
other
when
they
were
within
half
a
mile
of
the
railroad
station
they
heard
a
carriage
driven
at
a
rapid
rate
approaching
them
from
the
direction
of
riverdale
tom
seemed
to
be
uneasy
and
cast
frequent
glances
behind
him
in
a
moment
the
vehicle
was
within
a
short
distance
of
them
and
he
stopped
short
in
the
road
to
scrutinize
the
persons
in
it
by
jolly
exclaimed
tom
my
father
what
of
it
asked
bobby
surprised
by
the
strange
behavior
of
his
companion
tom
did
not
wait
to
reply
but
springing
over
the
fence
fled
like
a
deer
towards
some
woods
a
short
distance
from
the
road
was
it
possible
tom
had
run
away
from
home
his
father
had
not
consented
to
his
going
to
boston
and
bobby
was
mortified
to
find
that
his
hopeful
disciple
had
been
lying
to
him
ever
since
they
left
riverdale
but
he
was
glad
the
cheat
had
been
exposed
that
was
tom
with
you
was
it
asked
spicer
as
he
stopped
the
foaming
horse
yes
sir
but
he
told
me
you
had
consented
that
he
should
go
with
me
replied
bobby
a
little
disturbed
by
the
angry
glance
of
spicer
fiery
eyes
he
lied
the
young
villain
he
will
catch
it
for
this
i
would
not
have
let
him
come
with
me
only
for
that
i
asked
him
twice
over
if
you
were
willing
and
he
said
you
were
you
ought
to
have
known
better
than
to
believe
him
interposed
the
man
who
was
with
spicer
bobby
had
some
reason
for
believing
him
the
fact
that
tom
had
reformed
ought
to
have
entitled
him
to
some
consideration
and
our
hero
gave
him
the
full
benefit
of
the
declaration
to
have
explained
this
would
have
taken
more
time
than
he
could
spare
besides
it
was
a
great
moral
question
whose
importance
spicer
and
his
companion
would
not
be
likely
to
apprehend
so
he
made
a
short
story
of
it
and
resumed
his
walk
thankful
that
he
had
got
rid
of
tom
spicer
and
his
friend
after
fastening
the
horse
to
the
fence
went
to
the
woods
in
search
of
tom
bobby
reached
the
station
just
in
time
to
take
the
cars
and
in
a
moment
was
on
his
way
to
the
city
chapter
xv
in
which
bobby
gets
into
a
scrape
and
tom
spicer
turns
up
again
bobby
had
a
poorer
opinion
of
human
nature
than
ever
before
it
seemed
almost
incredible
to
him
that
words
so
fairly
spoken
as
those
of
tom
spicer
could
be
false
he
had
just
risen
from
a
sick
bed
where
he
had
had
an
opportunity
for
long
and
serious
reflection
tom
had
promised
fairly
and
bobby
had
every
reason
to
suppose
he
intended
to
be
a
good
boy
but
his
promises
had
been
lies
he
had
never
intended
to
reform
at
least
not
since
he
had
got
off
his
bed
of
pain
he
was
mortified
and
disheartened
at
the
failure
of
this
attempt
to
restore
him
to
himself
like
a
great
many
older
and
wiser
persons
than
himself
he
was
prone
to
judge
the
whole
human
family
by
a
single
individual
he
did
not
come
to
believe
that
every
man
was
a
rascal
but
in
more
general
terms
that
there
is
a
great
deal
more
rascality
in
this
world
than
one
would
be
willing
to
believe
with
this
sage
reflection
he
dismissed
tom
from
his
mind
which
very
naturally
turned
again
to
the
air
castle
which
had
been
so
ruthlessly
upset
then
his
opinion
of
the
rest
of
mankind
was
reversed
and
he
reflected
that
if
the
world
were
only
peopled
by
angels
like
annie
lee
what
a
pleasant
place
it
would
be
to
live
in
she
could
not
tell
a
lie
she
could
not
use
bad
language
she
could
not
steal
or
do
anything
else
that
was
bad
and
the
prospect
was
decidedly
pleasant
it
was
very
agreeable
to
turn
from
tom
to
annie
and
in
a
moment
his
air
castle
was
built
again
and
throned
on
clouds
of
gold
and
purple
i
do
not
know
what
impossible
things
he
imagined
or
how
far
up
in
the
clouds
he
would
have
gone
if
the
arrival
of
the
train
at
the
city
had
not
interrupted
his
thoughts
and
pitched
him
down
upon
the
earth
again
bobby
was
not
one
of
that
impracticable
class
of
persons
who
do
nothing
but
dream
for
he
felt
that
he
had
a
mission
to
perform
which
dreaming
could
not
accomplish
however
pleasant
it
may
be
to
think
of
the
great
and
brilliant
things
which
one
do
to
one
of
bobby
practical
character
it
was
even
more
pleasant
to
perform
them
we
all
dream
great
things
imagine
great
things
but
he
who
stops
there
does
not
amount
to
much
and
the
world
can
well
spare
him
for
he
is
nothing
but
a
drone
in
the
hive
bobby
fine
imaginings
were
pretty
sure
to
bring
out
a
now
or
never
which
was
the
pledge
of
action
and
the
work
was
as
good
as
done
when
he
had
said
it
therefore
when
the
train
arrived
bobby
did
not
stop
to
dream
any
longer
he
forgot
his
beautiful
air
castle
and
even
let
annie
lee
slip
from
his
mind
for
the
time
being
those
towns
upon
the
kennebec
the
two
hundred
books
he
was
to
sell
loomed
up
before
him
for
it
was
with
them
he
had
to
do
grasping
the
little
valise
he
carried
with
him
he
was
hastening
out
of
the
station
house
when
a
hand
was
placed
upon
his
shoulder
got
off
slick
did
i
said
tom
spicer
placing
himself
by
side
you
here
tom
exclaimed
our
hero
gazing
with
astonishment
at
his
late
companion
it
was
not
an
agreeable
encounter
and
from
the
bottom
of
his
heart
bobby
wished
him
anywhere
but
where
he
was
he
foresaw
that
he
could
not
easily
get
rid
of
him
i
am
here
replied
tom
i
ran
through
the
woods
to
the
depot
and
got
aboard
the
cars
just
as
they
were
starting
the
old
man
come
it
over
me
quite
so
slick
as
that
but
you
ran
away
from
home
well
what
of
it
a
good
deal
i
should
say
if
you
had
been
in
my
place
you
would
have
done
the
same
i
do
know
about
that
obedience
to
parents
is
one
of
our
first
duties
i
know
that
and
if
i
had
had
any
sort
of
fair
play
i
would
have
run
away
what
do
you
mean
by
that
asked
bobby
somewhat
surprised
though
he
had
a
faint
idea
of
the
meaning
of
the
other
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
by
and
by
i
give
you
my
word
of
honor
that
i
will
make
everything
satisfactory
to
you
but
you
lied
to
me
on
the
road
this
morning
tom
winced
under
ordinary
circumstances
he
would
have
resented
such
a
remark
by
clearing
away
for
a
fight
but
he
had
a
purpose
to
accomplish
and
he
knew
the
character
of
him
with
whom
he
had
to
deal
i
sorry
i
did
now
answered
tom
with
every
manifestation
of
penitence
for
his
fault
i
did
want
to
lie
to
you
and
it
went
against
my
conscience
to
do
so
but
i
was
afraid
if
i
told
you
my
father
refused
up
and
down
to
let
me
go
that
you
would
be
willing
i
should
come
with
you
i
shall
not
be
any
more
willing
now
i
know
all
about
it
added
bobby
in
an
uncompromising
tone
wait
till
you
have
heard
my
story
and
then
you
wo
blame
me
of
course
you
can
go
where
you
please
it
is
none
of
my
business
but
let
me
tell
you
tom
in
the
beginning
that
i
wo
go
with
a
fellow
who
has
run
away
from
his
father
and
mother
pooh
what
the
use
of
talking
in
that
way
tom
was
evidently
disconcerted
by
this
decided
stand
of
his
companion
he
knew
that
his
bump
of
firmness
was
well
developed
and
whatever
he
said
he
meant
you
had
better
return
home
tom
boys
that
run
away
from
home
often
amount
to
much
take
my
advice
and
go
home
added
bobby
to
such
a
home
as
mine
said
tom
gloomily
if
i
had
such
a
home
as
yours
i
would
not
have
left
it
bobby
got
a
further
idea
from
this
remark
of
the
true
state
of
the
case
and
the
consideration
moved
him
tom
father
was
a
notoriously
intemperate
man
and
the
boy
had
nothing
to
hope
for
from
his
precept
or
his
example
he
was
the
child
of
a
drunkard
and
as
much
to
be
pitied
as
blamed
for
his
vices
his
home
was
not
pleasant
he
who
presided
over
it
and
who
should
have
made
a
paradise
of
it
was
its
evil
genius
a
demon
of
wickedness
who
blasted
its
flowers
as
fast
as
they
bloomed
tom
had
seemed
truly
penitent
both
during
his
illness
and
since
his
recovery
his
one
great
desire
now
was
to
get
away
from
home
for
home
to
him
was
a
place
of
torment
bobby
suspected
all
this
and
in
his
great
heart
he
pitied
his
companion
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
i
am
sorry
for
you
tom
said
he
after
he
had
considered
the
matter
in
this
new
light
but
i
do
see
what
i
can
do
for
you
i
doubt
whether
it
would
be
right
for
me
to
help
you
run
away
from
your
parents
i
do
want
you
to
help
me
run
away
i
have
done
that
already
but
if
i
let
you
go
with
me
it
will
be
just
the
same
thing
besides
since
you
told
me
those
lies
this
morning
i
have
much
confidence
in
you
i
could
help
that
yes
you
could
could
help
lying
what
could
i
do
you
would
have
gone
right
back
and
told
my
father
well
we
will
go
up
to
bayard
store
and
then
we
will
see
what
can
be
done
i
could
stay
at
home
sure
continued
tom
as
they
walked
along
together
my
father
even
talked
of
binding
me
out
to
a
trade
did
he
bobby
stopped
short
in
the
street
for
it
was
evident
that
as
this
would
remove
him
from
his
unhappy
home
and
thus
effect
all
he
professed
to
desire
he
had
some
other
purpose
in
view
what
are
you
stopping
for
bob
i
think
you
had
better
go
back
tom
not
i
i
wo
do
that
whatever
happens
if
your
father
will
put
you
to
a
trade
what
more
do
you
want
i
wo
go
to
a
trade
anyhow
bobby
said
no
more
but
determined
to
consult
with
bayard
about
the
matter
and
tom
was
soon
too
busily
engaged
in
observing
the
strange
sights
and
sounds
of
the
city
to
think
of
anything
else
when
they
reached
the
store
bobby
went
into
bayard
private
office
and
told
him
all
about
the
affair
the
bookseller
decided
that
tom
had
run
away
more
to
avoid
being
bound
to
a
trade
than
because
his
home
was
unpleasant
and
this
decision
seemed
to
bobby
all
the
more
just
because
he
knew
that
tom
mother
though
a
drunkard
wife
was
a
very
good
woman
bayard
further
decided
that
bobby
ought
not
to
permit
the
runaway
to
be
the
companion
of
his
journey
he
also
considered
it
his
duty
to
write
to
spicer
informing
him
of
his
son
arrival
in
the
city
and
clearing
bobby
from
any
agency
in
his
escape
while
bayard
was
writing
the
letter
bobby
went
out
to
give
tom
the
result
of
the
consultation
the
runaway
received
it
with
a
great
show
of
emotion
and
begged
and
pleaded
to
have
the
decision
reversed
but
bobby
though
he
would
gladly
have
done
anything
for
him
which
was
consistent
with
his
duty
was
firm
as
a
rock
and
positively
refused
to
have
anything
to
do
with
him
until
he
obtained
his
consent
or
if
there
was
any
such
trouble
as
he
asserted
his
mother
consent
tom
left
the
store
apparently
more
in
sorrow
than
in
anger
his
bullying
nature
seemed
to
be
cast
out
and
bobby
could
not
but
feel
sorry
for
him
duty
was
imperative
as
it
always
is
and
it
must
be
done
now
or
never
during
the
day
the
little
merchant
attended
to
the
packing
of
his
stock
and
to
such
other
preparations
as
were
required
for
his
journey
he
must
take
the
steamer
that
evening
for
bath
and
when
the
time
for
his
departure
arrived
he
was
attended
to
the
wharf
by
bayard
and
ellen
with
whom
he
had
passed
the
afternoon
the
bookseller
assisted
him
in
procuring
his
ticket
and
berth
and
gave
him
such
instructions
as
his
inexperience
demanded
the
last
bell
rang
the
fasts
were
cast
off
and
the
great
wheels
of
the
steamer
began
to
turn
our
hero
who
had
never
been
on
the
water
in
a
steamboat
or
indeed
anything
bigger
than
a
punt
on
the
river
at
home
was
much
interested
and
excited
by
his
novel
position
he
seated
himself
on
the
promenade
deck
and
watched
with
wonder
the
boiling
surging
waters
astern
of
the
steamer
how
powerful
is
man
the
author
of
that
mighty
machine
that
bore
him
so
swiftly
over
the
deep
blue
waters
bobby
was
a
little
philosopher
as
we
have
before
had
occasion
to
remark
and
he
was
decidedly
of
the
opinion
that
the
steamboat
was
a
great
institution
when
he
had
in
some
measure
conquered
his
amazement
and
the
first
ideas
of
sublimity
which
the
steamer
and
the
sea
were
calculated
to
excite
in
a
poetical
imagination
he
walked
forward
to
take
a
closer
survey
of
the
machinery
after
all
there
was
something
rather
comical
in
the
affair
the
steam
hissed
and
sputtered
and
the
great
walking
beam
kept
flying
up
and
down
and
the
sum
total
of
bobby
philosophy
was
that
it
was
funny
these
things
should
make
the
boat
go
so
like
a
race
horse
over
the
water
then
he
took
a
look
into
the
pilot
house
and
it
seemed
more
funny
that
turning
that
big
wheel
should
steer
the
boat
but
the
wind
blew
rather
fresh
at
the
forward
part
of
the
boat
and
as
philosophy
was
not
proof
against
it
he
returned
to
the
promenade
deck
which
was
sheltered
from
the
severity
of
the
blast
he
had
got
reconciled
to
the
whole
thing
and
ceased
to
bother
his
head
about
the
big
wheel
the
sputtering
steam
and
the
walking
beam
so
he
seated
himself
and
began
to
wonder
what
all
the
people
in
riverdale
were
about
all
them
as
has
paid
their
fare
please
walk
up
to
the
office
and
shouted
a
colored
boy
presenting
himself
just
then
and
furiously
ringing
a
large
hand
bell
i
have
just
settled
said
bobby
alluding
to
his
comfortable
seat
but
the
allusion
was
so
indefinite
to
the
colored
boy
that
he
thought
himself
insulted
he
did
not
appear
to
be
a
very
amiable
boy
for
his
fist
was
doubled
up
and
with
sundry
big
oaths
he
threatened
to
annihilate
the
little
merchant
for
his
insolence
i
did
say
anything
that
need
offend
you
replied
bobby
i
meant
nothing
you
lie
you
did
he
was
on
the
point
of
administering
a
blow
with
his
fist
when
a
third
party
appeared
on
the
ground
and
without
waiting
to
hear
the
merits
of
the
case
struck
the
negro
a
blow
which
had
nearly
floored
him
some
of
the
passengers
now
interfered
and
the
colored
boy
was
prevented
from
executing
vengeance
on
the
assailant
strike
that
fellow
and
you
strike
me
said
he
who
had
struck
the
blow
tom
spicer
exclaimed
bobby
astonished
and
chagrined
at
the
presence
of
the
runaway
chapter
xvi
in
which
bobby
finds
it
is
an
ill
wind
that
blows
no
one
any
good
a
gentleman
who
was
sitting
near
bobby
when
he
made
the
remark
which
the
colored
boy
had
misunderstood
interfered
to
free
him
from
blame
and
probably
all
unpleasant
feelings
might
have
been
saved
if
zeal
had
been
properly
directed
as
it
was
the
waiter
retired
with
his
bell
vowing
vengeance
upon
his
assailant
how
came
you
here
tom
asked
bobby
when
the
excitement
had
subsided
you
do
get
rid
of
me
so
easily
replied
tom
laughing
bobby
called
to
mind
the
old
adage
that
a
bad
penny
is
sure
to
return
and
if
it
had
not
been
a
very
uncivil
remark
he
would
have
said
it
i
did
expect
to
see
you
again
at
present
he
observed
hardly
knowing
what
to
say
or
do
i
suppose
not
but
as
i
did
mean
you
should
expect
me
i
kept
out
of
sight
only
for
that
darkey
you
would
have
found
me
out
so
soon
i
like
you
bob
in
spite
of
all
you
have
done
to
get
rid
of
me
and
i
was
a
going
to
let
the
darkey
thrash
you
you
only
made
matters
worse
that
is
all
the
thanks
i
get
for
hitting
him
for
you
i
am
sorry
you
hit
him
at
the
same
time
i
suppose
you
meant
to
do
me
a
service
and
i
thank
you
not
for
the
blow
you
struck
the
black
boy
but
for
your
good
intentions
that
sounds
better
i
meant
well
bob
i
dare
say
you
did
but
how
came
you
here
why
you
see
i
was
bound
to
go
with
you
anyhow
or
at
least
to
keep
within
hail
of
you
you
told
me
you
know
that
you
were
going
in
the
steamboat
and
after
i
left
the
shop
what
should
i
see
but
a
big
picture
of
a
steamboat
on
a
wall
it
said
gardiner
and
hallowell
on
the
bill
and
i
knew
that
was
where
you
meant
to
go
so
this
afternoon
i
hunts
round
and
finds
the
steamboat
i
thought
i
never
should
have
found
it
but
here
i
am
what
are
you
going
to
do
going
into
the
book
business
replied
tom
with
a
smile
where
are
your
books
down
stairs
in
the
cellar
of
the
steamboat
or
whatever
you
call
it
where
did
you
get
them
bought
of
course
did
you
where
well
i
do
remember
the
name
of
the
street
now
i
could
go
right
there
if
i
was
in
the
city
though
would
they
trust
you
tom
hesitated
the
lies
he
had
told
that
morning
had
done
him
no
good
had
rather
injured
his
cause
and
though
he
had
no
principle
that
forbade
lying
he
questioned
its
policy
in
the
present
instance
i
paid
part
down
and
they
trusted
me
part
how
many
books
you
got
twenty
dollars
worth
i
paid
eight
dollars
down
you
did
where
did
you
get
the
eight
dollars
bobby
remembered
the
money
tom
father
had
lost
several
weeks
before
and
immediately
connected
that
circumstance
with
his
present
ability
to
pay
so
large
a
sum
tom
hesitated
again
but
he
was
never
at
a
loss
for
an
answer
my
mother
gave
it
to
me
your
mother
yes
replied
tom
boldly
and
in
that
peculiarly
bluff
manner
which
is
almost
always
good
evidence
that
the
boy
is
lying
but
you
ran
away
from
home
that
so
but
my
mother
knew
i
was
coming
did
she
to
be
sure
she
did
you
did
say
so
before
i
ca
tell
all
i
know
in
a
minute
if
i
thought
your
mother
consented
to
your
coming
i
would
say
another
word
well
she
did
you
may
bet
your
life
on
that
and
your
mother
gave
you
ten
dollars
who
said
she
gave
me
dollars
asked
tom
a
little
sharply
that
was
just
the
sum
his
father
had
lost
and
bobby
had
unwittingly
hinted
his
suspicion
you
must
have
had
as
much
as
that
if
you
paid
eight
on
your
books
your
fare
to
boston
and
your
steamboat
fare
must
be
two
dollars
more
i
know
that
but
look
here
bob
and
tom
took
from
his
pocket
five
half
dollars
and
exhibited
them
to
his
companion
she
gave
me
thirteen
dollars
notwithstanding
this
argument
bobby
felt
almost
sure
that
the
lost
ten
dollars
was
a
part
of
his
capital
i
will
tell
you
my
story
now
bob
if
you
like
you
condemned
me
without
a
hearing
as
jim
guthrie
said
when
they
sent
him
to
the
house
of
correction
for
getting
drunk
go
ahead
the
substance
of
tom
story
was
that
his
father
drank
so
hard
and
was
such
a
tyrant
in
the
house
that
he
could
endure
it
no
longer
his
father
and
mother
did
not
agree
as
any
one
might
have
suspected
his
mother
encouraged
by
the
success
of
bobby
thought
that
tom
might
do
something
of
the
kind
and
she
had
provided
him
the
money
to
buy
his
stock
of
books
bobby
had
not
much
confidence
in
this
story
he
had
been
deceived
once
besides
it
was
not
consistent
with
his
previous
narrative
and
he
had
not
before
hinted
that
he
had
obtained
his
consent
but
tom
was
eloquent
and
protested
that
he
had
reformed
and
meant
to
do
well
he
declared
by
all
that
was
good
and
great
bobby
should
never
have
reason
to
be
ashamed
of
him
our
little
merchant
was
troubled
he
could
not
now
get
rid
of
tom
without
actually
quarrelling
with
him
or
running
away
from
him
he
did
not
wish
to
do
the
former
and
it
was
not
an
easy
matter
to
do
the
latter
besides
there
was
hope
that
the
runaway
would
do
well
and
if
he
did
when
he
carried
the
profits
of
his
trade
home
his
father
would
forgive
him
one
thing
was
certain
if
he
returned
to
riverdale
he
would
be
what
he
had
been
before
for
these
reasons
bobby
finally
but
very
reluctantly
consented
that
tom
should
remain
with
him
resolving
however
that
if
he
did
not
behave
himself
he
would
leave
him
at
once
before
morning
he
had
another
reason
when
the
steamer
got
out
into
the
open
bay
bobby
was
seasick
he
retired
to
his
berth
with
a
dreadful
headache
as
he
described
it
afterwards
it
seemed
just
as
though
that
great
walking
beam
was
smashing
up
and
down
right
in
the
midst
of
his
brains
he
had
never
felt
so
ill
before
in
his
life
and
was
very
sure
in
his
inexperience
that
something
worse
than
mere
seasickness
ailed
him
he
told
tom
who
was
not
in
the
least
affected
how
he
felt
whereupon
the
runaway
blustered
round
got
the
steward
and
the
captain
into
the
cabin
and
was
very
sure
that
bobby
would
die
before
morning
if
we
may
judge
by
the
fuss
he
made
the
captain
was
angry
at
being
called
from
the
pilot
house
for
nothing
and
threatened
to
throw
tom
overboard
if
he
did
stop
his
noise
the
steward
however
was
a
man
and
assured
bobby
that
passengers
were
often
a
great
deal
sicker
than
he
was
but
he
promised
to
do
something
for
his
relief
and
tom
went
with
him
to
his
state
room
for
the
desired
remedy
the
potion
was
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
table
spoonful
of
brandy
which
bobby
who
had
conscientious
scruples
about
drinking
ardent
spirits
at
first
refused
to
take
then
tom
argued
the
point
and
the
sick
boy
yielded
the
dose
made
him
sicker
yet
and
nature
came
to
his
relief
and
in
a
little
while
he
felt
better
tom
behaved
like
a
good
nurse
he
staid
by
his
friend
till
he
went
to
sleep
and
then
turned
in
upon
a
settee
beneath
his
berth
the
boat
pitched
and
tumbled
about
so
in
the
heavy
sea
that
bobby
did
not
sleep
long
and
when
he
woke
he
found
tom
ready
to
assist
him
but
our
hero
felt
better
and
entreated
tom
to
go
to
sleep
again
he
made
the
best
of
his
unpleasant
situation
sleep
was
not
to
be
wooed
and
he
tried
to
pass
away
the
dreary
hours
in
thinking
of
riverdale
and
the
dear
ones
there
his
mother
was
asleep
and
annie
was
asleep
that
was
about
all
the
excitement
he
could
get
up
even
on
the
home
question
he
could
not
build
castles
in
the
air
for
seasickness
and
castle
building
do
not
agree
the
gold
and
purple
clouds
would
be
black
in
spite
of
him
and
the
aerial
structure
he
essayed
to
build
would
pitch
and
tumble
about
for
all
the
world
just
like
a
steamboat
in
a
heavy
sea
as
often
as
he
got
fairly
into
it
he
was
violently
rolled
out
and
in
a
twinkling
found
himself
in
his
narrow
berth
awfully
seasick
he
went
to
sleep
again
at
last
and
the
long
night
passed
away
when
he
woke
in
the
morning
he
felt
tolerably
well
and
was
thankful
that
he
had
got
out
of
that
scrape
but
before
he
could
dress
himself
he
heard
a
terrible
racket
on
deck
the
steam
whistle
was
shrieking
the
bell
was
banging
and
he
heard
the
hoarse
bellowing
of
the
captain
it
was
certain
that
something
had
happened
or
was
about
to
happen
then
the
boat
stopped
rolling
heavily
in
the
sea
tom
was
not
there
he
had
gone
on
deck
bobby
was
beginning
to
consider
what
a
dreadful
thing
a
wreck
was
when
tom
appeared
what
the
matter
asked
bobby
with
some
appearance
of
alarm
fog
replied
tom
it
is
so
thick
you
can
cut
it
with
a
hatchet
is
that
all
that
enough
where
are
we
that
is
just
what
the
pilot
would
like
to
know
they
ca
see
ahead
a
bit
and
do
know
where
we
are
bobby
went
on
deck
the
ocean
rolled
beneath
them
but
there
was
nothing
but
fog
to
be
seen
above
and
around
them
the
lead
was
heaved
every
few
moments
and
the
steamer
crept
slowly
along
till
it
was
found
the
water
shoaled
rapidly
when
the
captain
ordered
the
men
to
let
go
the
anchor
there
they
were
the
fog
was
as
obstinate
as
a
mule
and
would
not
lift
hour
after
hour
they
waited
for
the
captain
was
a
prudent
man
and
would
not
risk
the
life
of
those
on
board
to
save
a
few
hours
time
after
breakfast
the
passengers
began
to
display
their
uneasiness
and
some
of
them
called
the
captain
very
hard
names
because
he
would
not
go
on
almost
everybody
grumbled
and
made
themselves
miserable
nothing
to
do
and
nothing
to
read
growled
a
gentleman
as
he
yawned
and
stretched
himself
to
manifest
his
sensation
of
nothing
to
read
eh
thought
bobby
we
will
soon
supply
that
want
calling
tom
they
went
down
to
the
main
deck
where
the
baggage
had
been
placed
now
our
time
said
he
as
he
proceeded
to
unlock
one
of
the
trunks
that
contained
his
books
now
or
never
i
am
with
you
replied
tom
catching
the
idea
the
books
of
the
latter
were
in
a
box
and
he
was
obliged
to
get
a
hammer
to
open
it
but
with
bobby
assistance
he
soon
got
at
them
buy
wayfarer
said
bobby
when
he
returned
to
the
saloon
and
placed
a
volume
in
the
hands
of
the
yawning
gentleman
best
book
of
the
season
only
one
dollar
that
i
will
and
glad
of
the
chance
replied
the
gentleman
i
would
give
five
dollars
for
anything
if
it
were
only
the
almanac
others
were
of
the
same
mind
there
was
no
present
prospect
that
the
fog
would
lift
and
before
dinner
time
our
merchant
had
sold
fifty
copies
of
the
wayfarer
tom
whose
books
were
of
an
inferior
description
and
who
was
inexperienced
as
a
salesman
disposed
of
twenty
which
was
more
than
half
of
his
stock
the
fog
was
a
godsend
to
both
of
them
and
they
reaped
a
rich
harvest
from
the
occasion
for
almost
all
the
passengers
seemed
willing
to
spend
their
money
freely
for
the
means
of
occupying
the
heavy
hours
and
driving
away
that
dreadful
which
reigns
supreme
in
a
steamer
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
the
fog
blew
over
and
the
boat
proceeded
on
her
voyage
and
before
sunset
our
young
merchants
were
safely
landed
at
bath
chapter
xvii
in
which
tom
has
a
good
time
and
bobby
meets
with
a
terrible
misfortune
bath
afforded
our
young
merchants
an
excellent
market
for
their
wares
and
they
remained
there
the
rest
of
the
week
they
then
proceeded
to
brunswick
where
their
success
was
equally
flattering
thus
far
tom
had
done
very
well
though
bobby
had
frequent
occasion
to
remind
him
of
the
pledges
he
had
given
to
conduct
himself
in
a
proper
manner
he
would
swear
now
and
then
from
the
force
of
habit
but
invariably
when
bobby
checked
him
he
promised
to
do
better
at
brunswick
tom
sold
the
last
of
his
books
and
was
in
possession
of
about
thirty
dollars
twelve
of
which
he
owed
the
publisher
who
had
furnished
his
stock
this
money
seemed
to
burn
in
his
pocket
he
had
the
means
of
having
a
good
time
and
it
went
hard
with
him
to
plod
along
as
bobby
did
careful
to
save
every
penny
he
could
come
bob
let
get
a
horse
and
chaise
and
have
a
ride
what
do
you
say
proposed
tom
on
the
day
he
finished
selling
his
books
i
ca
spare
the
time
or
the
money
replied
bobby
decidedly
what
is
the
use
of
having
money
if
we
ca
spend
it
it
is
a
first
rate
day
and
we
should
have
a
good
time
i
ca
afford
it
i
have
a
great
many
books
to
sell
about
a
hundred
you
can
sell
them
fast
enough
i
do
spend
my
money
foolishly
it
would
be
foolishly
i
have
sold
out
and
i
am
bound
to
have
a
little
fun
now
you
never
will
succeed
if
you
do
business
in
that
way
why
not
you
will
spend
your
money
as
fast
as
you
get
it
pooh
we
can
get
a
horse
and
chaise
for
the
afternoon
for
two
dollars
that
is
not
much
considerable
i
should
say
but
if
you
begin
there
is
no
knowing
where
to
leave
off
i
make
it
a
rule
not
to
spend
a
single
cent
foolishly
and
if
i
do
begin
i
shall
never
do
it
i
do
mean
to
spend
all
i
get
only
a
little
now
and
then
persisted
tom
do
spend
the
first
dollar
for
nonsense
and
then
you
wo
spend
the
second
besides
when
i
have
any
money
to
spare
i
mean
to
buy
books
with
it
for
my
library
humbug
your
library
yes
my
library
i
mean
to
have
a
library
one
of
these
days
i
do
want
any
library
and
i
mean
to
spend
some
of
my
money
in
having
a
good
time
and
if
you
wo
go
with
me
i
shall
go
alone
that
all
you
can
do
as
you
please
of
course
but
i
advise
you
to
keep
your
money
you
will
want
it
to
buy
another
stock
of
books
i
shall
have
enough
for
that
what
do
you
say
will
you
go
with
me
or
not
no
i
will
not
enough
said
then
i
shall
go
alone
or
get
some
fellow
to
go
with
me
consider
well
before
you
go
pleaded
bobby
who
had
sense
enough
to
see
that
tom
proposed
good
time
would
put
back
if
not
entirely
prevent
the
reform
he
was
working
out
he
then
proceeded
to
reason
with
him
in
a
very
earnest
and
feeling
manner
telling
him
he
would
not
only
spend
all
his
money
but
completely
unfit
himself
for
business
what
he
proposed
to
do
was
nothing
more
nor
less
than
extravagance
and
it
would
lead
him
to
dissipation
and
ruin
i
am
going
to
send
one
hundred
dollars
to
bayard
continued
bobby
for
i
am
afraid
to
have
so
much
money
with
me
i
advise
you
to
send
your
money
to
your
employer
humph
catch
me
doing
that
i
am
bound
to
have
a
good
time
anyhow
at
least
send
the
money
you
owe
him
i
bet
i
wo
well
do
as
you
please
i
have
said
all
i
have
to
say
you
are
a
fool
bob
exclaimed
tom
who
had
evidently
used
bobby
as
much
as
he
wished
and
no
longer
cared
to
speak
soft
words
to
him
perhaps
i
am
but
i
know
better
than
to
spend
my
money
upon
fast
horses
if
you
will
go
i
ca
help
it
i
am
sorry
you
are
going
astray
what
do
you
mean
by
that
you
young
monkey
said
tom
angrily
this
was
tom
spicer
the
bully
it
sounded
like
him
and
with
a
feeling
of
sorrow
bobby
resigned
the
hopes
he
had
cherished
of
making
a
good
boy
of
him
we
had
better
part
now
added
our
hero
sadly
i
willing
i
shall
leave
brunswick
this
afternoon
for
the
towns
up
the
river
i
hope
no
harm
will
befall
you
good
by
tom
go
it
i
have
heard
your
preaching
about
long
enough
and
i
am
more
glad
to
get
rid
of
you
than
you
are
to
get
rid
of
me
bobby
walked
away
towards
the
house
where
he
had
left
the
trunk
containing
his
books
while
tom
made
his
way
towards
a
livery
stable
the
boys
had
been
in
the
place
for
several
days
and
had
made
some
acquaintances
so
tom
had
no
difficulty
in
procuring
a
companion
for
his
proposed
ride
our
hero
wrote
a
letter
that
afternoon
to
bayard
in
which
he
narrated
all
the
particulars
of
his
journey
his
relations
with
tom
spicer
and
the
success
that
had
attended
his
labors
at
the
bank
he
procured
a
hundred
dollar
note
for
his
small
bills
and
enclosed
it
in
the
letter
he
felt
sad
about
tom
the
runaway
had
done
so
well
had
been
so
industrious
and
shown
such
a
tractable
spirit
that
he
had
been
very
much
encouraged
about
him
but
if
he
meant
to
be
wild
again
for
it
was
plain
that
the
ride
was
only
the
beginning
of
sorrows
it
was
well
that
they
should
part
by
the
afternoon
stage
our
hero
proceeded
to
gardiner
passing
through
several
smaller
towns
which
did
not
promise
a
very
abundant
harvest
his
usual
success
attended
him
for
wherever
he
went
people
seemed
to
be
pleased
with
him
as
squire
lee
had
declared
they
would
be
his
pleasant
honest
face
was
a
capital
recommendation
and
his
eloquence
seldom
failed
to
achieve
the
result
which
eloquence
has
ever
achieved
from
demosthenes
down
to
the
present
day
our
limits
do
not
permit
us
to
follow
him
in
all
his
peregrinations
from
town
to
town
and
from
house
to
house
so
we
pass
over
the
next
fortnight
at
the
end
of
which
time
we
find
him
at
augusta
he
had
sold
all
his
books
but
twenty
and
had
that
day
remitted
eighty
dollars
more
to
bayard
it
was
wednesday
and
he
hoped
to
sell
out
so
as
to
be
able
to
take
the
next
steamer
for
boston
which
was
advertised
to
sail
on
the
following
day
he
had
heard
nothing
from
tom
since
their
parting
and
had
given
up
all
expectation
of
meeting
him
again
but
that
bad
penny
maxim
proved
true
once
more
for
as
he
was
walking
through
one
of
the
streets
of
augusta
he
had
the
misfortune
to
meet
him
and
this
time
it
was
indeed
a
misfortune
hallo
bobby
shouted
the
runaway
as
familiarly
as
though
nothing
had
happened
to
disturb
the
harmony
of
their
relations
ah
tom
i
did
expect
to
see
you
again
replied
bobby
not
very
much
rejoiced
to
meet
his
late
companion
i
suppose
not
but
here
i
am
as
good
as
new
have
you
sold
out
no
not
quite
how
many
have
you
left
about
twenty
but
i
thought
tom
you
would
have
returned
to
boston
before
this
time
no
and
tom
did
not
seem
to
be
in
very
good
spirits
where
are
you
going
now
i
do
know
i
ought
to
have
taken
your
advice
bobby
this
was
a
concession
and
our
hero
began
to
feel
some
sympathy
for
his
companion
as
who
does
not
when
the
erring
confess
their
faults
i
am
sorry
you
did
not
i
got
in
with
some
pretty
hard
fellows
down
there
to
brunswick
continued
tom
rather
sheepishly
and
spent
all
your
money
added
bobby
who
could
readily
understand
the
reason
why
tom
had
put
on
his
humility
again
not
all
how
much
have
you
left
not
much
replied
he
evasively
i
do
know
what
i
shall
do
i
am
in
a
strange
place
and
have
no
friends
bobby
sympathies
were
aroused
and
without
reflection
he
promised
to
be
a
friend
in
his
extremity
i
will
stick
by
you
this
time
bob
come
what
will
i
will
do
just
as
you
say
now
our
merchant
was
a
little
flattered
by
this
unreserved
display
of
confidence
he
did
not
give
weight
enough
to
the
fact
that
it
was
adversity
alone
which
made
tom
so
humble
he
was
in
trouble
and
gave
him
all
the
guarantee
he
could
ask
for
his
future
good
behavior
he
could
not
desert
him
now
he
was
in
difficulty
you
shall
help
me
sell
my
books
and
then
we
will
return
to
boston
together
have
you
money
enough
left
to
pay
your
employer
tom
hesitated
something
evidently
hung
heavily
upon
his
mind
i
do
know
how
it
will
be
after
i
have
paid
my
expenses
to
boston
he
replied
averting
his
face
bobby
was
perplexed
by
this
evasive
answer
but
as
tom
seemed
so
reluctant
to
go
into
details
he
reserved
his
inquiries
for
a
more
convenient
season
now
tom
you
take
the
houses
on
that
side
of
the
street
and
i
will
take
those
upon
this
side
you
shall
have
the
profits
on
all
you
sell
you
are
a
first
rate
fellow
bob
and
i
only
wish
i
had
done
as
you
wanted
me
to
do
ca
be
helped
now
and
we
will
do
the
next
best
thing
replied
bobby
as
he
left
his
companion
to
enter
a
house
tom
did
very
well
and
by
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
they
had
sold
all
the
books
but
four
the
wayfarer
had
been
liberally
advertised
in
that
vicinity
and
the
work
was
in
great
demand
bobby
heart
grew
lighter
as
the
volumes
disappeared
from
his
valise
and
already
he
had
begun
to
picture
the
scene
which
would
ensue
upon
his
return
to
the
little
black
house
how
glad
his
mother
would
be
to
see
him
and
he
dared
believe
how
happy
annie
would
be
as
she
listened
to
the
account
of
his
journey
in
the
state
of
maine
would
she
be
astonished
when
he
told
her
about
the
steamboat
about
the
fog
and
about
the
wild
region
at
the
mouth
of
the
beautiful
kennebec
poor
bobby
the
brightest
dream
often
ends
in
sadness
and
a
greater
trial
than
any
he
had
been
called
upon
to
endure
was
yet
in
store
for
him
as
he
walked
along
thinking
of
riverdale
and
its
loved
ones
tom
came
out
of
a
grocery
store
where
he
had
just
sold
a
book
here
bob
is
a
ten
dollar
bill
i
believe
i
have
sold
ten
books
for
you
said
tom
after
they
had
walked
some
distance
you
had
better
keep
the
money
now
and
while
i
think
of
it
you
had
better
take
what
i
have
left
of
my
former
sales
and
tom
handed
him
another
ten
dollar
bill
bobby
noticed
that
tom
seemed
very
much
confused
and
embarrassed
but
he
did
not
observe
that
the
two
bills
he
had
handed
him
were
on
the
same
bank
then
you
had
ten
dollars
left
after
your
frolic
he
remarked
as
he
took
the
last
bill
about
that
and
tom
glanced
uneasily
behind
him
what
is
the
matter
with
you
tom
asked
bobby
who
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
his
companion
embarrassment
nothing
bob
let
us
walk
a
little
faster
we
had
better
turn
up
this
street
continued
tom
as
with
a
quick
pace
he
took
the
direction
indicated
bobby
began
to
fear
that
tom
had
been
doing
something
wrong
and
the
suspicion
was
confirmed
by
seeing
two
men
running
with
all
their
might
towards
them
tom
perceived
them
at
the
same
moment
run
he
shouted
and
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
he
took
to
his
heels
and
fled
up
the
street
into
which
he
had
proposed
to
turn
bobby
did
not
run
but
stopped
short
where
he
was
till
the
men
came
up
to
him
grab
him
said
one
of
them
and
i
will
catch
the
other
the
man
collared
bobby
and
in
spite
of
all
the
resistance
he
could
make
dragged
him
down
the
street
to
the
grocery
store
in
which
tom
had
sold
his
last
book
what
do
you
mean
by
this
asked
bobby
his
blood
boiling
with
indignation
at
the
harsh
treatment
to
which
he
had
been
subjected
we
have
got
you
my
hearty
replied
the
man
releasing
his
hold
no
sooner
was
the
grasp
of
the
man
removed
than
bobby
who
determined
on
this
as
on
former
occasions
to
stand
upon
his
inalienable
rights
bolted
for
the
door
and
ran
away
with
all
his
speed
but
his
captor
was
too
fleet
for
him
and
he
was
immediately
retaken
to
make
him
sure
this
time
his
arms
were
tied
behind
him
and
he
was
secured
to
the
counter
of
the
shop
in
a
few
moments
the
other
man
returned
dragging
tom
in
triumph
after
him
by
this
time
quite
a
crowd
had
collected
which
nearly
filled
the
store
bobby
was
confounded
at
the
sudden
change
that
had
come
over
his
fortunes
but
seeing
that
resistance
would
be
vain
he
resolved
to
submit
with
the
best
grace
he
could
i
should
like
to
know
what
all
this
means
he
inquired
indignantly
the
crowd
laughed
in
derision
this
is
the
chap
that
stole
the
wallet
i
will
be
bound
said
one
pointing
to
tom
who
stood
in
surly
silence
awaiting
his
fate
he
is
the
one
who
came
into
the
store
replied
the
shopkeeper
have
stole
any
wallet
protested
bobby
who
now
understood
the
whole
affair
the
names
of
the
two
boys
were
taken
and
warrants
procured
for
their
detention
they
were
searched
and
upon
tom
was
found
the
lost
wallet
and
upon
bobby
two
ten
dollar
bills
which
the
loser
was
willing
to
swear
had
been
in
the
wallet
the
evidence
therefore
was
conclusive
and
they
were
both
sent
to
jail
poor
bobby
the
inmate
of
a
prison
the
law
took
its
course
and
in
due
time
both
of
them
were
sentenced
to
two
years
imprisonment
in
the
state
reform
school
bobby
was
innocent
but
he
could
not
make
his
innocence
appear
he
had
been
the
companion
of
tom
the
real
thief
and
part
of
the
money
had
been
found
upon
his
person
tom
was
too
mean
to
exonerate
him
and
even
had
the
hardihood
to
exult
over
his
misfortune
at
the
end
of
three
days
they
reached
the
town
in
which
the
reform
school
is
located
and
were
duly
committed
for
their
long
term
poor
bobby
chapter
xviii
in
which
bobby
takes

leave
and
camps
in

woods
the
intelligence
of
bobby
misfortune
reached
bayard
in
boston
by
means
of
the
newspapers
to
the
country
press
an
item
is
a
matter
of
considerable
importance
and
the
alleged
offence
against
the
peace
and
dignity
of
the
state
of
maine
was
duly
heralded
to
the
inquiring
public
as
a
daring
robbery
the
reporter
who
furnished
the
facts
in
the
case
for
publication
was
not
entirely
devoid
of
that
essential
qualification
of
the
country
item
writer
a
lively
imagination
and
was
obliged
to
dress
up
the
particulars
a
little
in
order
to
produce
the
necessary
amount
of
wonder
and
indignation
it
was
stated
that
one
of
the
two
young
men
had
been
prowling
about
the
place
for
several
days
ostensibly
for
the
purpose
of
selling
books
but
really
with
the
intention
of
stealing
whatever
he
could
lay
his
hands
upon
it
was
suggested
that
the
boys
were
in
league
with
an
organized
band
of
robbers
whose
nefarious
purposes
would
be
defeated
by
the
timely
arrest
of
these
young
villains
the
paper
hinted
that
further
depredations
would
probably
be
discovered
and
warned
people
to
beware
of
ruffians
strolling
about
the
country
in
the
guise
of
pedlers
the
writer
of
this
thrilling
paragraph
must
have
had
reason
to
believe
that
he
had
discharged
his
whole
duty
to
the
public
and
that
our
hero
was
duly
branded
as
a
desperate
fellow
no
doubt
he
believed
bobby
was
an
awful
monster
for
at
the
conclusion
of
his
remarks
he
introduced
some
severe
strictures
on
the
lenity
of
the
magistrate
because
he
had
made
the
sentence
two
years
instead
of
five
which
the
writer
thought
the
atrocious
crime
deserved
but
then
the
justice
differed
from
him
in
politics
which
may
account
for
the
severity
of
the
article
bayard
read
this
precious
paragraph
with
mingled
grief
and
indignation
he
understood
the
case
at
a
glance
tom
spicer
had
joined
him
and
the
little
merchant
had
been
involved
in
his
crime
he
was
sure
that
bobby
had
had
no
part
in
stealing
the
money
one
so
noble
and
true
as
he
had
been
could
not
steal
he
reasoned
it
was
contrary
to
experience
contrary
to
common
sense
he
was
very
much
disturbed
this
intelligence
would
be
a
severe
blow
to
the
poor
boy
mother
and
he
had
not
the
courage
to
destroy
all
her
bright
hopes
by
writing
her
the
terrible
truth
he
was
confident
that
bobby
was
innocent
and
that
his
being
in
the
company
of
tom
spicer
had
brought
the
imputation
upon
him
so
he
could
not
let
the
matter
take
its
course
he
was
determined
to
do
something
to
procure
his
liberty
and
restore
his
reputation
squire
lee
was
in
the
city
that
day
and
had
left
his
store
only
half
an
hour
before
he
discovered
the
paragraph
he
immediately
sent
to
his
hotel
for
him
and
together
they
devised
means
to
effect
liberation
the
squire
was
even
more
confident
than
bayard
that
our
hero
was
innocent
of
the
crime
charged
upon
him
they
agreed
to
proceed
immediately
to
the
state
of
maine
and
use
their
influence
in
obtaining
his
pardon
the
bookseller
was
a
man
of
influence
in
the
community
and
was
as
well
known
in
maine
as
in
massachusetts
but
to
make
their
application
the
surer
he
procured
letters
of
introduction
from
some
of
the
most
distinguished
men
in
boston
to
the
governor
and
other
official
persons
in
maine
we
will
leave
them
now
to
do
the
work
they
had
so
generously
undertaken
and
return
to
the
reform
school
where
bobby
and
tom
were
confined
the
latter
took
the
matter
very
coolly
he
seemed
to
feel
that
he
deserved
his
sentence
but
he
took
a
malicious
delight
in
seeing
bobby
the
companion
of
his
captivity
he
even
had
the
hardihood
to
remind
him
of
the
blow
he
had
struck
him
more
than
two
months
before
telling
him
that
he
had
vowed
vengeance
then
and
now
the
time
had
come
he
was
satisfied
you
know
i
did
steal
the
money
or
have
anything
to
do
with
it
said
bobby
some
of
it
was
found
upon
you
though
sneered
tom
maliciously
you
know
how
it
came
there
if
no
one
else
does
of
course
i
do
but
i
like
your
company
too
well
to
get
rid
of
you
so
easy
the
lord
is
with
the
innocent
replied
bobby
and
something
tells
me
that
i
shall
not
stay
in
this
place
a
great
while
going
to
run
away
asked
tom
with
interest
and
suddenly
dropping
his
malicious
look
i
know
i
am
innocent
of
any
crime
and
i
know
that
the
lord
will
not
let
me
stay
here
a
great
while
what
do
you
mean
to
do
bob
bobby
made
no
reply
he
felt
that
he
had
had
more
confidence
in
tom
than
he
deserved
and
he
determined
to
keep
his
own
counsel
in
future
he
had
a
purpose
in
view
his
innocence
gave
him
courage
and
perhaps
he
did
not
feel
that
sense
of
necessity
for
submission
to
the
laws
of
the
land
which
age
and
experience
give
he
prayed
earnestly
for
deliverance
from
the
place
in
which
he
was
confined
he
felt
that
he
did
not
deserve
to
be
there
and
though
it
was
a
very
comfortable
place
and
the
boys
fared
as
well
as
he
wished
to
fare
still
it
seemed
to
him
like
a
prison
he
was
unjustly
detained
and
he
not
only
prayed
to
be
delivered
but
he
resolved
to
work
out
his
own
deliverance
at
the
first
opportunity
knowing
that
whatever
he
had
would
be
taken
from
him
he
resolved
by
some
means
to
keep
possession
of
the
twenty
dollars
he
had
about
him
he
had
always
kept
his
money
in
a
secret
place
in
his
jacket
to
guard
against
accident
and
the
officers
who
had
searched
him
had
not
discovered
it
but
now
his
clothes
would
be
changed
he
thought
of
these
things
before
his
arrival
so
when
he
reached
the
entrance
and
got
out
of
the
wagon
to
open
the
gate
by
order
of
the
officer
he
slipped
his
twenty
dollars
into
a
hole
in
the
wall
it
so
happened
that
there
was
not
a
suit
of
clothes
in
the
store
room
of
the
institution
which
would
fit
him
and
he
was
permitted
to
wear
his
own
dress
till
another
should
be
made
after
his
name
and
description
had
been
entered
and
the
superintendent
had
read
him
a
lecture
upon
his
future
duties
he
was
permitted
to
join
the
other
boys
who
were
at
work
on
the
farm
he
was
sent
with
half
a
dozen
others
to
pick
up
stones
in
a
neighboring
field
no
officer
was
with
them
and
bobby
was
struck
with
the
apparent
freedom
of
the
institution
and
he
so
expressed
himself
to
his
companions
not
so
much
freedom
as
you
think
for
said
one
in
reply
i
should
think
the
fellows
would
clear
out
not
so
easy
a
matter
there
is
a
standing
reward
of
five
dollars
to
any
one
who
brings
back
a
runaway
they
must
catch
him
first
no
fellow
ever
got
away
yet
they
always
caught
him
before
he
got
ten
miles
from
the
place
this
was
an
important
suggestion
to
bobby
who
already
had
a
definite
purpose
in
his
mind
like
a
skilful
general
he
had
surveyed
the
ground
on
his
arrival
and
was
at
once
prepared
to
execute
his
design
in
his
conversation
with
the
boys
he
obtained
the
history
of
several
who
had
attempted
to
escape
and
found
that
even
those
who
got
a
fair
start
were
taken
on
some
public
road
he
perceived
that
they
were
not
good
generals
and
he
determined
to
profit
by
their
mistake
a
short
distance
from
the
institution
was
what
appeared
to
be
a
very
extensive
wood
beyond
this
many
miles
distant
he
could
see
the
ocean
glittering
like
a
sheet
of
ice
under
the
setting
sun
he
carefully
observed
the
hills
and
obtained
the
bearings
of
various
prominent
objects
in
the
vicinity
which
would
aid
him
in
his
flight
the
boys
gave
him
all
the
information
in
their
power
about
the
localities
of
the
country
they
seemed
to
feel
that
he
was
possessed
of
a
superior
spirit
and
that
he
would
not
long
remain
among
them
but
whatever
they
thought
they
kept
their
own
counsel
bobby
behaved
well
and
was
so
intelligent
and
prompt
that
he
obtained
the
confidence
of
the
superintendent
who
began
to
employ
him
about
the
house
and
in
his
own
family
he
was
sent
of
errands
in
the
neighborhood
and
conducted
himself
so
much
to
the
satisfaction
of
his
guardians
that
he
was
not
required
to
work
in
the
field
after
the
second
day
of
his
residence
on
the
farm
one
afternoon
he
was
told
that
his
clothes
were
ready
and
that
he
might
put
them
on
the
next
morning
this
was
a
disagreeable
announcement
for
bobby
saw
that
with
the
uniform
of
the
institution
upon
his
back
his
chance
of
escape
would
be
very
slight
but
about
sunset
he
was
sent
by
the
superintendent
lady
to
deliver
a
note
at
a
house
in
the
vicinity
now
or
never
said
bobby
to
himself
after
he
had
left
the
house
now
my
time
as
he
passed
the
gate
he
secured
his
money
and
placed
it
in
the
secret
receptacle
of
his
jacket
after
he
had
delivered
the
letter
he
took
the
road
and
hastened
off
in
the
direction
of
the
wood
his
heart
beat
wildly
at
the
prospect
of
once
more
meeting
his
mother
after
nearly
four
weeks
absence
annie
lee
would
welcome
him
she
would
not
believe
that
he
was
a
thief
he
had
been
four
days
an
inmate
of
the
reform
school
and
nothing
but
the
hope
of
soon
attaining
his
liberty
had
kept
his
spirits
from
drooping
he
had
not
for
a
moment
despaired
of
getting
away
he
reached
the
entrance
to
the
wood
and
taking
a
cart
path
began
to
penetrate
its
hidden
depths
the
night
darkened
upon
him
he
heard
the
owl
screech
his
dismal
note
and
the
chant
his
cheery
song
a
certain
sense
of
security
now
pervaded
his
mind
for
the
darkness
concealed
him
from
the
world
and
he
had
placed
six
good
miles
between
him
and
the
prison
as
he
considered
it
he
walked
on
however
till
he
came
to
what
seemed
to
be
the
end
of
the
wood
and
he
hoped
to
reach
the
blue
ocean
he
had
seen
in
the
distance
before
morning
leaving
the
forest
he
emerged
into
the
open
country
there
was
here
and
there
a
house
before
him
but
the
aspect
of
the
country
seemed
strangely
familiar
to
him
he
could
not
understand
it
he
had
never
been
in
this
part
of
the
country
before
yet
there
was
a
great
house
with
two
barns
by
the
side
of
it
which
he
was
positive
he
had
seen
before
he
walked
across
the
field
a
little
farther
when
to
his
astonishment
and
dismay
he
beheld
the
lofty
turrets
of
the
state
reform
school
he
had
been
walking
in
a
circle
and
had
come
out
of
the
forest
near
the
place
where
he
had
entered
it
bobby
as
the
reader
has
found
out
by
this
time
was
a
philosopher
as
well
as
a
hero
and
instead
of
despairing
or
wasting
his
precious
time
in
vain
regrets
at
his
mistake
he
laughed
a
little
to
himself
at
the
blunder
and
turned
back
into
the
woods
again
now
or
never
muttered
he
it
will
never
do
to
give
it
up
so
for
an
hour
he
walked
on
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
a
great
bright
star
in
the
sky
then
he
found
that
the
cart
path
crooked
round
and
he
discovered
where
he
had
made
his
blunder
leaving
the
road
he
made
his
way
in
a
straight
line
still
guided
by
the
star
till
he
came
to
a
large
sheet
of
water
the
sheet
of
water
was
an
effectual
barrier
to
his
farther
progress
indeed
he
was
so
tired
he
did
not
feel
able
to
walk
any
more
he
deemed
himself
safe
from
immediate
pursuit
in
this
secluded
place
he
needed
rest
and
he
foresaw
that
the
next
few
days
would
be
burdened
with
fatigue
and
hardship
which
he
must
be
prepared
to
meet
bobby
was
not
nice
about
trifles
and
his
habits
were
such
that
he
had
no
fear
of
taking
cold
his
comfortable
bed
in
the
little
black
house
was
preferable
to
the
cold
ground
even
with
the
primeval
forest
for
a
chamber
but
circumstances
alter
cases
and
he
did
not
waste
any
vain
regrets
about
the
necessity
of
his
position
after
finding
a
secluded
spot
in
the
wood
he
raked
the
dry
leaves
together
for
a
bed
and
offering
his
simple
but
fervent
prayer
to
the
great
guardian
above
he
lay
down
to
rest
the
owl
screamed
his
dismal
note
and
the
still
repeated
his
monotonous
song
but
they
were
good
company
in
the
solitude
of
the
dark
forest
he
could
not
go
to
sleep
for
a
time
so
strange
and
exciting
were
the
circumstances
of
his
position
he
thought
of
a
thousand
things
but
he
could
not
himself
to
sleep
as
he
was
wont
to
do
at
last
nature
worn
out
by
fatigue
and
anxiety
conquered
the
circumstances
and
he
slept
chapter
xix
in
which
bobby
has
a
narrow
escape
and
goes
to
sea
with
sam
ray
nature
was
kind
to
the
little
pilgrim
in
his
extremity
and
kept
his
senses
sealed
in
grateful
slumber
till
the
birds
had
sung
their
matin
song
and
the
sun
had
risen
high
in
the
heavens
bobby
woke
with
a
start
and
sprang
to
his
feet
for
a
moment
he
did
not
realize
where
he
was
or
remember
the
exciting
incidents
of
the
previous
evening
he
felt
refreshed
by
his
deep
slumber
and
came
out
of
it
as
vigorous
as
though
he
had
slept
in
his
bed
at
home
rubbing
his
eyes
he
stared
about
him
at
the
tall
pines
whose
foliage
canopied
his
bed
and
his
identity
was
soon
restored
to
him
he
was
bobby
bright
but
bobby
bright
in
trouble
he
was
not
the
little
merchant
but
the
little
fugitive
fleeing
from
the
prison
to
which
he
had
been
doomed
it
did
not
take
him
long
to
make
his
toilet
which
was
the
only
advantage
of
his
primitive
style
of
lodging
his
first
object
was
to
examine
his
position
and
ascertain
in
what
direction
he
should
continue
his
flight
he
could
not
go
ahead
as
he
had
intended
for
the
sheet
of
water
was
an
impassable
barrier
leaving
the
dense
forest
he
came
to
a
marsh
beyond
which
was
the
wide
creek
he
had
seen
in
the
night
it
was
salt
water
and
he
reasoned
that
it
could
not
extend
a
great
way
inland
his
only
course
was
to
follow
it
till
he
found
means
of
crossing
it
following
the
direction
of
the
creek
he
kept
near
the
margin
of
the
wood
till
he
came
to
a
public
road
he
had
some
doubts
about
trusting
himself
out
of
the
forest
even
for
a
single
moment
so
he
seated
himself
upon
a
rock
to
argue
the
point
if
any
one
should
happen
to
come
along
he
was
almost
sure
of
furnishing
a
clew
to
his
future
movements
if
not
of
being
immediately
captured
this
was
a
very
strong
argument
but
there
was
a
stronger
one
upon
the
other
side
he
had
eaten
nothing
since
dinner
on
the
preceding
day
and
he
began
to
feel
faint
for
the
want
of
food
on
the
other
side
of
the
creek
he
saw
a
pasture
which
looked
as
though
it
might
afford
him
a
few
berries
and
he
was
on
the
point
of
taking
to
the
road
when
he
heard
the
rumbling
of
a
wagon
in
the
distance
his
heart
beat
with
apprehension
perhaps
it
was
some
officer
of
the
institution
in
search
of
him
at
any
rate
it
was
some
one
who
had
come
from
the
vicinity
of
the
reform
school
and
who
had
probably
heard
of
his
escape
as
it
came
nearer
he
heard
the
jingling
of
bells
it
was
the
baker
how
he
longed
for
a
loaf
of
his
bread
or
some
of
the
precious
gingerbread
he
carried
in
his
cart
hunger
tempted
him
to
run
the
risk
of
exposure
he
had
money
he
could
buy
cakes
and
bread
and
perhaps
the
baker
had
a
kind
heart
and
would
befriend
him
in
his
distress
the
wagon
was
close
at
hand
now
or
never
thought
he
but
this
time
it
was
not
the
risk
was
too
great
if
he
failed
now
two
years
of
captivity
were
before
him
and
as
for
the
hunger
he
could
grin
and
bear
it
for
a
while
now
or
never
but
this
time
it
was
escape
now
or
never
and
he
permitted
the
baker
to
pass
without
hailing
him
he
waited
half
an
hour
and
then
determined
to
take
the
road
till
he
had
crossed
the
creek
the
danger
was
great
but
the
pangs
of
hunger
urged
him
on
he
was
sure
there
were
berries
in
the
pasture
and
with
a
timid
step
carefully
watching
before
and
behind
to
insure
himself
against
surprise
he
crossed
the
bridge
but
then
a
new
difficulty
presented
itself
there
was
a
house
within
ten
rods
of
the
bridge
which
he
must
pass
and
to
do
so
would
expose
him
to
the
most
imminent
peril
he
was
on
the
point
of
retreating
when
a
man
came
out
of
the
house
and
approached
him
what
should
he
do
it
was
a
trying
moment
if
he
ran
the
act
would
expose
him
to
suspicion
if
he
went
forward
the
man
might
have
already
received
a
description
of
him
and
arrest
him
he
chose
the
latter
course
the
instinct
of
his
being
was
to
do
everything
in
a
straightforward
manner
and
this
probably
prompted
his
decision
good
morning
sir
said
he
boldly
to
the
man
good
morning
where
are
you
travelling
this
was
a
hard
question
he
did
not
know
where
he
was
travelling
besides
even
in
his
present
difficult
position
he
could
not
readily
resort
to
a
lie
down
here
a
piece
he
replied
travelled
far
not
far
good
morning
sir
and
bobby
resumed
his
walk
i
say
boy
suppose
you
tell
me
where
you
are
going
and
the
man
came
close
to
him
and
deliberately
surveyed
him
from
head
to
foot
i
can
hardly
tell
you
replied
bobby
summoning
courage
for
the
occasion
well
i
suppose
not
added
the
man
with
a
meaning
smile
bobby
felt
his
strength
desert
him
as
he
realized
that
he
was
suspected
of
being
a
runaway
from
the
reform
school
that
smile
on
the
man
face
was
the
knell
of
hope
and
for
a
moment
he
felt
a
flood
of
misery
roll
over
his
soul
but
the
natural
elasticity
of
his
spirits
soon
came
to
his
relief
and
he
resolved
not
to
give
up
the
ship
even
if
he
had
to
fight
for
it
i
am
in
a
hurry
so
i
shall
have
to
leave
you
not
just
yet
young
man
perhaps
as
you
do
know
where
you
are
going
you
may
remember
what
your
name
is
continued
the
man
good
naturedly
there
was
a
temptation
to
give
a
false
name
but
as
it
was
so
strongly
beaten
into
our
hero
that
the
truth
is
better
than
a
falsehood
he
held
his
peace
excuse
me
sir
but
i
ca
stop
to
talk
now
in
a
hurry
well
i
dare
say
you
are
i
suppose
there
is
no
doubt
but
you
are
master
robert
bright
not
the
least
sir
i
have
denied
it
yet
and
i
am
not
ashamed
of
my
name
replied
bobby
with
a
good
deal
of
spirit
that
honest
i
like
that
is
the
best
policy
added
bobby
that
cool
for
a
rogue
anyhow
you
ought
to
thought
of
that
afore
i
did
and
stole
the
money
i
did
i
never
stole
a
penny
in
my
life
come
i
like
that
it
is
the
truth
but
they
wo
believe
it
over
to
the
reform
school
laughed
the
man
they
will
one
of
these
days
perhaps
you
are
a
smart
youngster
but
i
do
know
as
i
can
make
five
dollars
any
easier
than
by
taking
you
back
where
you
come
from
yes
you
can
replied
bobby
promptly
can
i
yes
how
by
letting
me
go
eh
you
talk
flush
i
suppose
you
mean
to
give
me
your
note
payable
when
the
kennebec
dries
up
cash
on
the
nail
replied
bobby
you
look
like
a
man
with
a
heart
in
your
bosom
bobby
stole
this
passage
from
the
wayfarer
i
reckon
i
have
the
time
has
come
yet
when
sam
ray
could
see
a
in
distress
and
not
help
him
out
but
to
help
a
thief
off
we
will
argue
that
matter
interposed
bobby
i
can
prove
to
you
beyond
a
doubt
that
i
am
innocent
of
the
crime
charged
upon
me
you
do
look
like
a
bad
boy
i
must
say
but
ray
i
hungry
i
have
eaten
a
mouthful
since
yesterday
noon
thunder
you
do
say
so
exclaimed
sam
ray
i
never
could
bear
to
see
a
man
hungry
much
more
a
boy
so
come
along
to
my
house
and
get
something
to
eat
and
we
will
talk
about
the
other
matter
afterwards
sam
ray
took
bobby
to
the
little
old
house
in
which
he
dwelt
and
in
a
short
time
his
wife
who
expressed
her
sympathy
for
the
little
fugitive
in
the
warmest
terms
had
placed
an
abundant
repast
upon
the
table
our
hero
did
ample
justice
to
it
and
when
he
had
finished
he
felt
like
a
new
creature
now
ray
let
me
tell
you
my
story
said
bobby
i
do
know
as
it
any
use
now
you
have
eat
my
bread
and
butter
i
do
feel
like
being
mean
to
you
if
anybody
else
wants
to
carry
you
back
they
may
i
wo
but
you
shall
hear
me
and
bobby
proceeded
to
deliver
his
plain
unvarnished
tale
when
he
had
progressed
but
a
little
way
in
the
narrative
the
noise
of
an
approaching
vehicle
was
heard
sam
looked
out
of
the
window
as
almost
everybody
does
in
the
country
when
a
carriage
passes
by
thunder
it
the
reform
school
wagon
exclaimed
he
this
way
boy
and
the
man
thrust
him
into
his
chamber
bidding
him
get
under
the
bed
the
carriage
stopped
at
the
house
but
sam
evaded
a
direct
reply
and
the
superintendent
for
it
was
he
proceeded
on
his
search
heaven
bless
you
mr
ray
exclaimed
bobby
when
he
came
out
of
the
chamber
as
the
tears
of
gratitude
coursed
down
his
cheeks
o
you
will
find
sam
ray
all
right
said
he
warmly
pressing
proffered
hand
i
ai
quite
a
heathen
though
some
folks
around
here
think
so
you
are
an
angel
not
exactly
laughed
sam
our
hero
finished
his
story
and
confirmed
it
by
exhibiting
his
account
book
and
some
other
papers
which
he
had
retained
sam
ray
was
satisfied
and
vowed
that
if
ever
he
saw
tom
spicer
he
would
certainly
lick
him
for
his
sake
now
sonny
i
like
you
i
will
be
sworn
you
are
a
good
fellow
and
i
mean
to
help
you
off
so
just
come
along
with
me
i
make
my
living
by
browsing
round
hunting
and
fishing
a
little
and
doing
an
odd
job
now
and
then
you
see
i
have
got
a
good
boat
down
the
creek
and
i
shall
just
put
you
aboard
and
take
you
anywhere
you
have
a
mind
to
go
may
heaven
reward
you
cried
bobby
almost
overcome
by
this
sudden
and
unexpected
kindness
o
i
do
want
no
reward
only
when
you
get
to
be
a
great
man
and
i
am
dead
sure
you
will
be
a
great
man
just
think
now
and
then
of
sam
ray
and
it
all
right
i
shall
remember
you
with
gratitude
as
long
as
i
live
sam
ray
took
his
gun
on
his
shoulder
and
bobby
the
box
of
provisions
which
ray
had
put
up
and
they
left
the
house
at
the
bridge
they
got
into
a
little
skiff
and
sam
took
the
oars
after
they
had
passed
a
bend
in
the
creek
which
concealed
them
from
the
road
bobby
felt
secure
from
further
molestation
sam
pulled
about
two
miles
down
the
creek
where
it
widened
into
a
broad
bay
near
the
head
of
which
was
anchored
a
small
schooner
now
my
hearty
nothing
short
of
uncle
sam
whole
navy
can
get
you
away
from
me
said
sam
as
he
pulled
alongside
the
schooner
you
have
been
very
kind
to
me
all
right
sonny
now
tumble
aboard
bobby
jumped
upon
the
deck
of
the
little
craft
and
sam
followed
him
after
making
fast
the
skiff
to
the
schooner
moorings
in
a
few
minutes
the
little
vessel
was
standing
down
the
bay
with
a
fresh
wind
and
a
flowing
sheet
bobby
who
had
never
been
in
a
sail
boat
before
was
delighted
and
in
no
measured
terms
expressed
his
admiration
of
the
working
of
the
trim
little
craft
now
sonny
where
shall
we
go
asked
sam
as
they
emerged
from
the
bay
into
the
broad
ocean
i
do
know
replied
bobby
i
want
to
get
back
to
boston
perhaps
i
can
put
you
aboard
of
some
coaster
bound
there
that
will
do
nicely
i
will
head
towards
boston
and
if
i
do
overhaul
anything
i
will
take
you
there
myself
is
this
boat
big
enough
to
go
so
far
she
stand
anything
short
of
a
west
india
hurricane
you
afeard
are
you
o
no
i
like
it
the
big
waves
now
tossed
the
little
vessel
up
and
down
like
a
feather
and
the
huge
seas
broke
upon
the
bow
deluging
her
deck
with
floods
of
water
bobby
had
unlimited
confidence
in
sam
ray
and
felt
as
much
at
home
as
though
he
had
been
cradled
upon
the
briny
deep
there
was
an
excitement
in
the
scene
which
accorded
with
his
nature
and
the
perils
which
he
had
so
painfully
pictured
on
the
preceding
night
were
all
born
into
the
most
lively
joys
they
ate
their
dinners
from
the
provision
box
sam
lighted
his
pipe
and
many
a
tale
he
told
of
adventure
by
sea
and
land

felt
happy
and
almost
dreaded
the
idea
of
parting
with
his
rough
but
friend
they
were
now
far
out
at
sea
and
the
night
was
coming
on
now
sonny
you
had
better
turn
in
and
take
a
snooze
you
did
rest
much
last
night
i
am
not
sleepy
but
there
is
one
thing
i
will
do
and
bobby
drew
from
his
secret
receptacle
his
roll
of
bills
put
them
up
sonny
said
sam
i
want
to
make
you
a
present
of
ten
dollars
you
ca
do
it
nay
but
to
please
me
no
sir
well
then
let
me
send
it
to
your
good
wife
you
ca
do
that
nuther
replied
sam
gazing
earnestly
at
a
schooner
ahead
of
him
you
must
your
good
heart
made
you
lose
five
dollars
and
i
insist
upon
making
it
up
to
you
you
ca
do
it
i
shall
feel
bad
if
you
do
take
it
you
see
i
have
twenty
dollars
here
and
i
would
like
to
give
you
the
whole
of
it
not
a
cent
sonny
i
ai
a
heathen
that
schooner
ahead
is
bound
for
boston
i
reckon
i
shall
be
sorry
to
part
with
you
mr
ray
just
my
sentiment
i
hai
seen
a
youngster
afore
for
many
a
day
that
i
took
a
fancy
to
and
i
hate
to
let
you
go
we
shall
meet
again
i
hope
so
please
to
take
this
money
no
and
sam
shook
his
head
so
resolutely
that
bobby
gave
up
the
point
as
sam
had
conjectured
the
lumber
schooner
was
bound
to
boston
her
captain
readily
agreed
to
take
our
hero
on
board
and
he
sadly
bade
adieu
to
his
kind
friend
good
by
ray
said
bobby
as
the
schooner
filled
away
take
this
to
remember
me
by
it
was
his
jackknife
but
sam
did
not
discover
the
ten
dollar
bill
which
was
shut
beneath
the
blade
till
it
was
too
late
to
return
it
bobby
did
not
cease
to
wave
his
hat
to
sam
till
his
little
craft
disappeared
in
the
darkness
chapter
xx
in
which
the
clouds
blow
over
and
bobby
is
himself
again
fortunately
for
bobby
the
wind
began
to
blow
very
heavily
soon
after
he
went
on
board
of
the
lumber
schooner
so
that
the
captain
was
too
much
engaged
in
working
his
vessel
to
ask
many
questions
he
was
short
handed
and
though
our
hero
was
not
much
of
a
sailor
he
made
himself
useful
to
the
best
of
his
ability
though
the
wind
was
heavy
it
was
not
fair
and
it
was
not
till
the
third
morning
after
his
parting
with
sam
ray
that
the
schooner
arrived
off
boston
light
the
captain
then
informed
him
that
as
the
tide
did
not
favor
him
he
might
not
get
up
to
the
city
for
hours
and
if
he
was
in
a
hurry
he
would
put
him
on
board
a
pilot
boat
which
he
saw
standing
up
the
channel
thank
you
captain
you
are
very
kind
but
it
would
give
you
a
great
deal
of
trouble
said
bobby
none
at
all
we
must
wait
here
till
the
tide
turns
so
we
have
nothing
better
to
do
i
should
be
very
glad
to
get
up
this
morning
you
shall
then
and
the
captain
ordered
two
men
to
get
out
the
jolly
boat
i
will
pay
my
passage
now
if
you
please
that
is
paid
paid
i
should
say
you
had
worked
your
passage
you
have
done
very
well
and
i
shall
not
charge
you
anything
i
expected
to
pay
my
passage
captain
but
if
you
think
i
have
done
enough
to
pay
it
why
i
have
nothing
to
say
only
that
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
you
ought
to
be
a
sailor
young
man
you
were
cut
out
for
one
i
like
the
sea
though
i
never
saw
it
till
a
few
weeks
since
but
i
suppose
my
mother
would
not
let
me
go
to
sea
i
suppose
not
mothers
are
always
afraid
of
salt
water
by
this
time
the
jolly
boat
was
alongside
and
bidding
the
captain
adieu
he
jumped
into
it
and
the
men
pulled
him
to
the
pilot
boat
which
had
come
up
into
the
wind
at
the
captain
hail
bobby
was
kindly
received
on
board
and
in
a
couple
of
hours
landed
at
the
wharf
in
boston
with
a
beating
heart
he
made
his
way
up
into
washington
street
he
felt
strangely
his
cheeks
seemed
to
tingle
for
he
was
aware
that
the
imputation
of
dishonesty
was
fastened
upon
him
he
could
not
doubt
but
that
the
story
of
his
alleged
crime
had
reached
the
city
and
perhaps
gone
to
his
friends
in
riverdale
how
his
poor
mother
must
have
wept
to
think
her
son
was
a
thief
no
she
never
could
have
thought
that
knew
he
would
not
steal
if
no
one
else
did
and
annie
lee
would
she
ever
smile
upon
him
again
would
she
welcome
him
to
her
father
house
so
gladly
as
she
had
done
in
the
past
he
could
bring
nothing
to
establish
his
innocence
but
his
previous
character
would
not
bayard
frown
upon
him
would
not
even
ellen
be
tempted
to
forget
the
service
he
had
rendered
her
bobby
had
thought
of
all
these
things
before
on
his
cold
damp
bed
in
the
forest
in
the
watches
of
the
tempestuous
night
on
board
the
schooner
but
now
when
he
was
almost
in
the
presence
of
those
he
loved
and
respected
they
had
more
force
and
they
nearly
overwhelmed
him
i
am
innocent
he
repeated
to
himself
and
why
need
i
fear
my
good
father
in
heaven
will
not
let
me
be
wronged
yet
he
could
not
overcome
his
anxiety
and
when
he
reached
the
store
of
bayard
he
passed
by
dreading
to
face
the
friend
who
had
been
so
kind
to
him
he
could
not
bear
even
to
be
suspected
of
a
crime
by
him
now
or
never
said
he
as
he
turned
round
i
will
know
my
fate
at
once
and
then
make
the
best
of
it
mustering
all
his
courage
he
entered
the
store
timmins
was
not
there
so
he
was
spared
the
infliction
of
any
remark
from
him
hallo
bobby
exclaimed
the
gentlemanly
salesman
whose
acquaintance
he
had
made
on
his
first
visit
good
morning
bigelow
replied
bobby
with
as
much
boldness
as
he
could
command
i
did
know
as
i
should
ever
see
you
again
you
have
been
gone
a
long
while
longer
than
usual
answered
bobby
with
a
blush
for
he
considered
the
remark
of
the
salesman
as
an
allusion
to
his
imprisonment
is
bayard
in
he
is
in
his
office
bobby
feet
would
hardly
obey
the
mandate
of
his
will
and
with
a
faltering
step
he
entered
the
private
room
of
the
bookseller
bayard
was
absorbed
in
the
perusal
of
the
morning
paper
and
did
not
observe
his
entrance
with
his
heart
up
in
his
throat
and
almost
choking
him
he
stood
for
several
minutes
upon
the
threshold
he
almost
feared
to
speak
dreading
the
severe
frown
with
which
he
expected
to
be
received
suspense
however
was
more
painful
than
condemnation
and
he
brought
his
resolution
up
to
the
point
bayard
said
he
in
faltering
tones
bobby
exclaimed
the
bookseller
dropping
his
paper
upon
the
floor
and
jumping
upon
his
feet
as
though
an
electric
current
had
passed
through
his
frame
grasping
our
hero
hand
he
shook
it
with
so
much
energy
that
under
any
other
circumstances
bobby
would
have
thought
it
hurt
him
he
did
not
think
so
now
my
poor
bobby
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
continued
bayard
bobby
burst
into
tears
and
sobbed
like
a
child
as
he
was
the
unexpected
kindness
of
this
reception
completely
overwhelmed
him
do
cry
bobby
i
know
all
about
it
and
the
bookseller
wiped
away
his
tears
it
was
a
stroke
of
misfortune
but
it
is
all
right
now
but
bobby
could
not
help
crying
and
the
more
bayard
attempted
to
console
him
the
more
he
wept
i
am
innocent
bayard
he
sobbed
i
know
you
are
bobby
and
all
the
world
knows
you
are
i
am
ruined
now
i
shall
never
dare
to
hold
my
head
up
again
nonsense
bobby
you
will
hold
your
head
the
higher
you
have
behaved
like
a
hero
i
ran
away
from
the
state
reform
school
sir
i
was
innocent
and
i
would
rather
have
died
than
stayed
there
i
know
all
about
it
my
young
friend
now
dry
your
tears
and
we
will
talk
it
all
over
bobby
blew
and
sputtered
a
little
more
but
finally
he
composed
himself
and
took
a
chair
by
bayard
side
the
bookseller
then
drew
from
his
pocket
a
ponderous
document
with
a
big
official
seal
upon
it
and
exhibited
it
to
our
hero
do
you
see
this
bobby
it
is
your
free
and
unconditional
pardon
sir
why
it
will
all
end
well
you
may
depend
bobby
was
amazed
his
pardon
but
it
would
not
restore
his
former
good
name
he
felt
that
he
was
branded
as
a
felon
it
was
not
mercy
but
justice
that
he
wanted
truth
is
mighty
and
will
prevail
continued
bayard
and
this
document
restores
your
reputation
i
can
hardly
believe
that
ca
you
hear
my
story
then
when
i
read
in
one
of
the
maine
papers
the
account
of
your
misfortune
i
felt
that
you
had
been
grossly
wronged
you
were
coupled
with
that
tom
spicer
who
is
the
most
consummate
little
villain
i
ever
saw
and
i
understood
your
situation
ah
bobby
your
only
mistake
was
in
having
anything
to
do
with
that
fellow
i
left
him
at
brunswick
because
he
began
to
behave
badly
but
he
joined
me
again
at
augusta
he
had
spent
nearly
all
his
money
and
did
not
know
what
to
do
i
pitied
him
and
meant
to
do
something
to
help
him
out
of
the
scrape
generous
as
ever
i
have
heard
all
about
this
before
indeed
who
told
you
tom
spicer
himself
tom
asked
bobby
completely
mystified
yes
tom
you
see
when
i
heard
about
your
trouble
squire
lee
and
myself
squire
lee
does
he
know
about
it
he
does
and
you
may
depend
upon
it
he
thinks
more
highly
of
you
than
ever
before
he
and
i
immediately
went
down
to
augusta
to
inquire
into
the
matter
we
called
upon
the
governor
of
the
state
who
said
that
he
had
seen
you
and
bought
a
book
of
you
of
me
exclaimed
bobby
startled
to
think
he
had
sold
a
book
to
a
governor
yes
you
called
at
his
house
probably
you
did
not
know
that
he
was
the
chief
magistrate
of
the
state
at
any
rate
he
was
very
much
pleased
with
you
and
sorry
to
hear
of
your
misfortune
well
we
followed
your
route
to
brunswick
where
we
ascertained
how
tom
had
conducted
in
a
week
he
established
a
very
bad
reputation
there
but
nothing
could
be
found
to
implicate
you
the
squire
testified
to
your
uniform
good
behavior
and
especially
to
your
devotion
to
your
mother
in
short
we
procured
your
pardon
and
hastened
with
it
to
the
state
reform
school
on
our
arrival
we
learned
to
our
surprise
and
regret
that
you
had
escaped
from
the
institution
on
the
preceding
evening
every
effort
was
made
to
retake
you
but
without
success
ah
bobby
you
managed
that
well
they
did
look
in
the
right
place
replied
bobby
with
a
smile
for
he
began
to
feel
happy
again
by
the
permission
of
the
superintendent
squire
lee
and
myself
examined
tom
spicer
he
is
a
great
rascal
perhaps
he
thought
we
would
get
him
out
so
he
made
a
clean
breast
of
it
and
confessed
that
you
had
no
hand
in
the
robbery
and
that
you
knew
nothing
about
it
he
gave
you
the
two
bills
on
purpose
to
implicate
you
in
the
crime
we
wrote
down
his
statement
and
had
it
sworn
to
before
a
justice
of
the
peace
you
shall
read
it
by
and
by
may
heaven
reward
you
for
your
kindness
to
a
poor
boy
exclaimed
bobby
the
tears
flowing
down
his
cheeks
again
i
did
not
deserve
so
much
from
you
mr
bayard
yes
you
did
and
a
thousand
times
more
i
was
very
sorry
you
had
left
the
institution
and
i
waited
in
the
vicinity
till
they
said
there
was
no
probability
that
you
would
be
captured
the
most
extraordinary
efforts
were
used
to
find
you
but
there
was
not
a
person
to
be
found
who
had
seen
or
heard
of
you
i
was
very
much
alarmed
about
you
and
offered
a
hundred
dollars
for
any
information
concerning
you
i
am
sorry
you
had
so
much
trouble
i
wish
i
had
known
you
were
there
how
did
you
get
off
bobby
briefly
related
the
story
of
his
escape
and
bayard
pronounced
his
skill
worthy
of
his
genius
sam
ray
is
a
good
fellow
we
will
remember
him
added
the
bookseller
when
he
had
finished
i
shall
remember
him
and
only
that
i
shall
be
afraid
to
go
into
the
state
of
maine
after
what
has
happened
i
should
pay
him
a
visit
one
of
these
days
there
you
are
wrong
those
who
know
your
story
would
sooner
think
of
giving
you
a
public
reception
than
of
saying
or
doing
anything
to
injure
your
feelings
those
who
have
suffered
unjustly
are
always
lionized
but
no
one
will
know
my
story
only
that
i
was
sent
to
prison
for
stealing
there
you
are
mistaken
again
we
put
articles
in
all
the
principal
papers
stating
the
facts
in
the
case
and
establishing
your
innocence
beyond
a
peradventure
go
to
augusta
now
bobby
and
you
will
be
a
lion
i
am
sure
i
had
no
idea
of
getting
out
of
the
scrape
so
easily
as
this
innocence
shall
triumph
my
young
friend
what
does
mother
say
asked
bobby
his
countenance
growing
sad
i
do
not
know
we
returned
from
maine
only
yesterday
but
squire
lee
will
satisfy
her
all
that
can
worry
her
as
it
has
worried
me
will
be
her
fears
for
your
safety
when
she
hears
of
your
escape
i
will
soon
set
her
mind
at
ease
upon
that
point
i
will
take
the
noon
train
home
a
word
about
business
before
you
go
i
discharged
timmins
about
a
week
ago
and
i
have
kept
his
place
for
you
by
gracious
exclaimed
bobby
thrown
completely
out
of
his
propriety
by
this
announcement
i
think
you
will
do
better
in
the
long
run
than
you
would
to
travel
about
the
country
i
was
talking
with
ellen
about
it
and
she
says
it
shall
be
so
timmins
salary
was
five
hundred
dollars
a
year
and
you
shall
have
the
same
five
hundred
dollars
a
year
ejaculated
bobby
amazed
at
the
vastness
of
the
sum
very
well
for
a
boy
of
thirteen
bobby
i
was
fourteen
last
sunday
sir
i
would
not
give
any
other
boy
so
much
but
you
are
worth
it
and
you
shall
have
it
probably
bayard
gratitude
had
something
to
do
with
this
munificent
offer
but
he
knew
that
our
hero
possessed
abilities
and
energy
far
beyond
his
years
he
further
informed
bobby
that
he
should
have
a
room
at
his
house
and
that
ellen
was
delighted
with
the
arrangement
he
proposed
the
gloomy
threatening
clouds
were
all
rolled
back
and
floods
of
sunshine
streamed
in
upon
the
soul
of
the
little
merchant
but
in
the
midst
of
his
rejoicing
he
remembered
that
his
own
integrity
had
carried
him
safely
through
the
night
of
sorrow
and
doubt
he
had
been
true
to
himself
and
now
in
the
hour
of
his
great
triumph
he
realized
that
if
he
had
been
faithless
to
the
light
within
him
his
laurel
would
have
been
a
crown
of
thorns
he
was
happy
very
happy
what
made
him
so
not
his
dawning
prosperity
not
the
favor
of
bayard
not
the
handsome
salary
he
was
to
receive
for
all
these
things
would
have
been
but
dross
if
he
had
sacrificed
his
integrity
his
love
of
truth
and
uprightness
he
had
been
true
to
himself
and
unseen
angels
had
held
him
up
he
had
been
faithful
and
the
consciousness
of
his
fidelity
to
principle
made
a
heaven
within
his
heart
it
was
arranged
that
he
should
enter
upon
the
duties
of
his
new
situation
on
the
following
week
after
settling
with
bayard
he
found
he
had
nearly
seventy
dollars
in
his
possession
so
that
in
a
pecuniary
point
of
view
if
in
no
other
his
eastern
excursion
was
perfectly
satisfactory
by
the
noon
train
he
departed
for
riverdale
and
in
two
hours
more
he
was
folded
to
his
mother
heart
mrs
bright
wept
for
joy
now
as
she
had
before
wept
in
misery
when
she
heard
of
her
son
misfortune
it
took
him
all
the
afternoon
to
tell
his
exciting
story
to
her
and
she
was
almost
beside
herself
when
bobby
told
her
about
his
new
situation
after
tea
he
hastened
over
to
squire
lee
and
my
young
readers
can
imagine
what
a
warm
reception
he
had
from
father
and
daughter
for
the
third
time
that
day
he
narrated
his
adventures
in
the
east
and
annie
declared
they
were
better
than
any
novel
she
had
ever
read
perhaps
it
was
because
bobby
was
the
hero
it
was
nearly
ten
before
he
finished
his
story
and
when
he
left
the
squire
made
him
promise
to
come
over
the
next
day
chapter
xxi
in
which
bobby
steps
off
the
stage
and
the
author
must
finish
now
or
never
the
few
days
which
bobby
remained
at
home
before
entering
upon
the
duties
of
his
new
situation
were
agreeably
filled
up
in
calling
upon
his
many
friends
and
in
visiting
those
pleasant
spots
in
the
woods
and
by
the
river
which
years
of
association
had
rendered
dear
to
him
his
plans
for
the
future
too
occupied
some
of
his
time
though
inasmuch
as
his
path
of
duty
was
already
marked
out
these
plans
were
but
little
more
than
a
series
of
fond
imaginings
in
short
little
more
than
day
dreams
i
have
before
hinted
that
bobby
was
addicted
to
castle
building
and
i
should
pity
the
man
or
boy
who
was
not
who
had
no
bright
dream
of
future
achievements
of
future
usefulness
as
a
man
thinketh
so
is
he
the
psalmist
tells
us
and
it
was
the
pen
of
inspiration
which
wrote
it
what
a
man
pictures
as
his
ideal
of
that
which
is
desirable
in
this
world
and
the
world
to
come
he
will
endeavor
to
attain
even
if
it
be
no
higher
aim
than
the
possession
of
wealth
or
fame
it
is
good
and
worthy
as
far
as
it
goes
it
fires
his
brain
it
nerves
his
arm
it
stimulates
him
to
action
and
action
is
the
soul
of
progress
we
must
all
work
and
this
world
were
cold
and
dull
if
it
had
no
bright
dreams
to
be
realized
what
napoleon
dreamed
he
labored
to
accomplish
and
the
monarchs
of
europe
trembled
before
him
what
howard
wished
to
be
he
labored
to
be
his
ideal
was
beautiful
and
true
and
he
raised
a
throne
which
will
endure
through
eternity
bobby
dreamed
great
things
that
bright
picture
of
the
little
black
house
transformed
into
a
white
cottage
with
green
blinds
and
surrounded
by
a
pretty
fence
was
the
nearest
object
and
before
mrs
bright
was
aware
that
he
was
in
earnest
the
carpenters
and
the
painters
were
upon
the
spot
now
or
never
replied
bobby
to
his
mother
remonstrance
this
is
your
home
and
it
shall
be
the
pleasantest
spot
upon
earth
if
i
can
make
it
so
then
he
had
to
dream
about
his
business
in
boston
and
i
am
not
sure
but
that
he
fancied
himself
a
rich
merchant
like
bayard
living
in
an
elegant
house
in
chestnut
street
and
having
clerks
and
porters
to
do
as
he
bade
them
a
great
many
young
men
dream
such
things
and
though
they
seem
a
little
silly
when
spoken
out
loud
they
are
what
wood
and
water
are
to
the
steam
engine
they
are
the
mainspring
of
action
some
are
stupid
enough
to
dream
about
these
things
and
spend
their
time
in
idleness
and
dissipation
waiting
for
the
good
time
coming
it
will
never
come
to
them
they
are
more
likely
to
die
in
the
almshouse
or
the
state
prison
than
to
ride
in
their
carriages
for
constant
exertion
is
the
price
of
success
bobby
enjoyed
himself
to
the
utmost
of
his
capacity
during
these
few
days
of
respite
from
labor
he
spent
a
liberal
share
of
his
time
at
squire
lee
where
he
was
almost
as
much
at
home
as
in
his
house
annie
read
moore
poems
to
him
till
he
began
to
have
quite
a
taste
for
poetry
himself
in
connection
with
tom
spicer
continued
absence
which
had
to
be
explained
bobby
trials
in
the
eastern
country
leaked
out
and
the
consequence
was
that
he
became
a
lion
in
riverdale
the
minister
invited
him
to
tea
as
well
as
other
prominent
persons
for
the
sake
of
hearing
his
story
but
bobby
declined
the
polite
invitations
from
sheer
bashfulness
he
had
not
brass
enough
to
make
himself
a
hero
besides
the
remembrance
of
his
journey
was
anything
but
pleasant
to
him
on
monday
morning
he
took
the
early
train
for
boston
and
assumed
the
duties
of
his
situation
in
bayard
store
but
as
i
have
carried
my
hero
through
the
eventful
period
of
his
life
i
can
not
dwell
upon
his
subsequent
career
he
applied
himself
with
all
the
energy
of
his
nature
to
the
discharge
of
his
duties
early
in
the
morning
and
late
in
the
evening
he
was
at
his
post
bigelow
was
his
friend
from
the
first
and
gave
him
all
the
instruction
he
required
his
intelligence
and
quick
perception
soon
enabled
him
to
master
the
details
of
the
business
and
by
the
time
he
was
fifteen
he
was
competent
to
perform
any
service
required
of
him
by
the
advice
of
bayard
he
attended
an
evening
school
for
six
months
in
the
year
to
acquire
a
knowledge
of
book
keeping
and
to
compensate
for
the
opportunities
of
which
he
had
been
necessarily
deprived
in
his
earlier
youth
he
took
franklin
for
his
model
and
used
all
his
spare
time
in
reading
good
books
and
in
obtaining
such
information
and
such
mental
culture
as
would
fit
him
to
be
not
only
a
good
merchant
but
a
good
and
true
man
every
saturday
night
he
went
home
to
riverdale
to
spend
the
sabbath
with
his
mother
the
little
black
house
no
longer
existed
for
it
had
become
the
little
paradise
of
which
he
had
dreamed
only
that
the
house
seemed
whiter
the
blinds
greener
and
the
fence
more
attractive
than
his
fancy
had
pictured
them
his
mother
after
a
couple
of
years
at
bobby
earnest
pleadings
ceased
to
close
shoes
and
take
in
washing
but
she
had
enough
and
to
spare
for
her
son
salary
was
now
six
hundred
dollars
his
kind
employer
boarded
him
for
nothing
much
against
bobby
will
i
must
say
so
that
every
month
he
carried
to
his
mother
thirty
dollars
which
more
than
paid
her
expenses
eight
years
have
passed
by
since
bobby
we
beg
his
pardon
he
is
now
robert
bright
entered
the
store
of
bayard
he
has
passed
from
the
boy
to
the
man
over
the
street
door
a
new
sign
has
taken
the
place
of
the
old
one
and
the
reads
bayard
bright
booksellers
and
publishers
the
senior
partner
resorts
to
his
counting
room
every
morning
from
the
force
of
habit
but
he
takes
no
active
part
in
the
business
mr
bright
has
frequent
occasion
to
ask
his
advice
though
everything
is
directly
managed
by
him
and
the
junior
is
accounted
one
of
the
ablest
but
at
the
same
time
one
of
the
most
honest
business
men
in
the
city
his
integrity
has
never
been
sacrificed
even
to
the
emergencies
of
trade
the
man
is
what
the
boy
was
and
we
can
best
sum
up
the
results
of
his
life
by
saying
that
he
has
been
true
to
himself
true
to
his
friends
and
true
to
his
god
mrs
bright
is
still
living
at
the
little
white
cottage
happy
in
herself
and
happy
in
her
children
bobby
we
mean
mr
bright
has
hardly
missed
going
to
riverdale
on
a
saturday
night
since
he
left
home
eight
years
before
he
has
the
same
partiality
for
those
famous
apple
pies
and
his
mother
would
as
soon
think
of
being
without
bread
as
being
without
apple
pies
when
he
comes
home
of
course
squire
lee
and
annie
were
always
glad
to
see
him
when
he
came
to
riverdale
and
for
two
years
it
had
been
common
talk
in
riverdale
that
our
hero
did
not
go
home
on
sunday
evening
when
the
clock
struck
nine
but
as
this
is
a
forbidden
topic
we
will
ask
the
reader
to
go
with
us
to
bayard
house
in
chestnut
street
what
annie
lee
here
no
but
as
you
are
here
allow
me
to
introduce
robert
bright
they
were
married
a
few
months
before
and
bayard
insisted
that
the
happy
couple
should
make
their
home
at
his
house
but
where
is
ellen
bayard
o
she
is
bigelow
now
and
her
husband
is
at
the
head
of
a
large
book
establishment
in
new
york
bobby
dream
had
been
realized
and
he
was
the
happiest
man
in
the
world
at
least
he
thought
so
which
is
just
the
same
thing
he
had
been
successful
in
business
his
wife
the
friend
and
companion
of
his
youth
the
brightest
filament
of
the
bright
vision
his
fancy
had
woven
had
been
won
and
the
future
glowed
with
brilliant
promises
he
had
been
successful
but
neither
nor
all
of
the
things
we
have
mentioned
constituted
his
highest
and
truest
success
not
his
business
prosperity
not
the
bright
promise
of
wealth
in
store
for
him
not
his
good
name
among
men
not
even
the
beautiful
and
loving
wife
who
had
cast
her
lot
with
his
to
the
end
of
time
these
were
successes
great
and
worthy
but
not
the
highest
success
he
had
made
himself
a
man
this
was
his
real
success
a
true
a
christian
man
he
had
lived
a
noble
life
he
had
reared
the
lofty
structure
of
his
manhood
upon
a
solid
foundation
principle
it
is
the
rock
which
the
winds
of
temptation
and
the
rains
of
selfishness
can
not
move
robert
bright
is
happy
because
he
is
good
tom
spicer
now
in
the
state
prison
is
unhappy
not
he
is
in
the
state
prison
but
because
the
evil
passions
of
his
nature
are
at
war
with
the
peace
of
his
soul
he
has
fed
the
good
that
was
within
him
upon
straw
and
husks
and
starved
it
out
he
is
a
body
only
the
soul
is
dead
in
trespasses
and
sin
he
loves
no
one
and
no
one
loves
him
during
the
past
summer
mr
bright
and
his
lady
took
a
journey
down
east
annie
insisted
upon
visiting
the
state
reform
school
and
her
husband
drove
through
the
forest
by
which
he
had
made
his
escape
on
that
eventful
night
afterwards
they
called
upon
sam
ray
who
had
been
dead
sure
that
bobby
would
one
day
be
a
great
man
he
was
about
the
same
person
and
was
astonished
and
delighted
when
our
hero
introduced
himself
they
spent
a
couple
of
hours
in
talking
over
the
past
and
at
his
departure
mr
bright
made
him
a
handsome
present
in
such
a
delicate
manner
that
he
could
not
help
accepting
it
squire
lee
is
still
as
hale
and
hearty
as
ever
and
is
never
so
happy
as
when
annie
and
her
husband
come
to
riverdale
to
spend
the
sabbath
he
is
fully
of
the
opinion
that
mr
bright
is
the
greatest
man
on
the
western
continent
and
he
would
not
be
in
the
least
surprised
if
he
should
be
elected
president
of
the
united
states
one
of
these
days
the
little
merchant
is
a
great
merchant
now
but
more
than
this
he
is
a
good
man
he
has
formed
his
character
and
he
will
probably
die
as
he
has
lived
