i
you
are
the
comfort
of
my
life
effie
if
you
make
up
your
mind
to
go
away
what
is
to
become
of
me
the
speaker
was
a
woman
she
was
lying
on
a
sofa
in
a
shabby
little
parlor
the
sofa
was
covered
with
the
room
had
a
faded
paper
and
faded
chintz
covered
the
shabby
furniture
the
pleading
words
were
emphasized
by
her
tired
eyes
and
worn
face
she
looked
full
at
the
young
girl
to
whom
she
spoke
what
shall
i
do
without
you
and
what
will
your
father
say
i
have
made
up
my
mind
said
effie
i
do
want
to
be
unkind
to
you
mother
i
love
you
more
than
words
can
say
but
i
must
go
out
into
the
world
i
must
live
my
life
like
other
girls
you
had
none
of
these
ideas
until
you
met
dorothy
fraser
yes
i
have
had
them
for
a
long
time
dorothy
has
given
them
emphasis
that
all
dorothy
mother
did
not
like
her
to
go
away
but
now
she
is
glad
she
says
that
nothing
has
made
dorothy
into
so
fine
a
woman
as
taking
her
life
into
her
own
hands
and
making
the
best
she
can
of
it
before
i
go
mother
i
will
get
agnes
to
learn
all
my
duties
she
shall
help
you
she
is
nearly
fourteen
she
ought
to
be
of
use
to
you
ought
she
not
she
would
not
be
like
you
replied
staunton
she
is
very
young
remember
and
is
at
school
most
of
the
day
i
wo
argue
with
you
effie
but
it
tires
me
even
to
think
of
it
effie
sighed
she
bent
down
and
kissed
her
mother
her
words
had
sounded
hard
and
almost
defiant
but
there
was
nothing
at
all
hard
or
defiant
about
her
sweet
face
she
was
a
girl
and
looked
as
if
she
might
be
any
age
between
seventeen
and
twenty
there
was
a
likeness
between
her
and
her
mother
quite
sufficient
to
show
their
relationship
both
faces
were
softly
curved
both
pairs
of
eyes
were
dark
and
the
mother
must
have
been
even
prettier
in
her
youth
than
the
daughter
was
now
as
i
say
continued
staunton
it
fills
me
with
terror
to
think
of
doing
without
you
try
not
to
think
of
it
mother
i
am
not
going
yet
i
only
want
to
go
very
much
indeed
i
am
going
to
talk
to
father
about
it
i
want
to
have
the
thing
arranged
while
dorothy
is
here
here
effie
went
suddenly
on
her
knees
by
the
sofa
and
threw
one
young
arm
protectingly
round
her
mother
you
do
not
know
what
it
means
to
me
she
said
when
dorothy
talks
of
the
full
life
the
keen
interest
the
battle
the
thrill
of
living
i
feel
that
i
must
go
into
it
i
must
while
effie
was
speaking
staunton
looked
fixedly
at
her
there
are
moments
which
all
mothers
know
when
they
put
themselves
completely
out
of
sight
when
they
blot
themselves
out
as
it
were
this
time
had
come
to
staunton
now
after
a
pause
she
said
and
her
words
came
out
even
without
a
sigh
the
question
after
all
is
this
effie
what
will
your
father
say
when
he
thinks
it
out
carefully
he
will
be
pleased
replied
effie
he
must
be
interested
in
the
profession
i
want
to
take
up
how
often
oh
how
often
mother
has
he
groaned
and
sighed
at
the
bad
nursing
which
his
patients
get
you
know
you
have
always
said
and
he
has
said
the
same
that
i
am
a
born
nurse
wo
he
be
proud
and
pleased
when
i
come
home
and
tell
him
all
about
the
new
ways
in
which
things
are
done
in
london
hospitals
you
know
there
are
six
of
us
and
agnes
and
katie
are
growing
up
and
can
take
my
place
at
home
presently
of
course
i
know
that
father
is
quite
the
cleverest
doctor
in
whittington
but
nobody
gets
ill
here
and
it
is
quite
impossible
to
go
on
clothing
and
feeding
six
of
us
with
no
means
at
all
i
do
not
think
i
am
vain
mother
and
i
do
not
really
care
very
much
about
dress
but
mine
is
shabby
is
it
not
i
think
i
should
look
pretty
as
pretty
as
you
must
have
looked
long
ago
if
i
were
better
dressed
no
dress
can
change
your
face
said
staunton
with
sudden
passion
you
have
the
sweetest
and
dearest
face
in
the
world
to
me
when
you
go
away
the
sunshine
will
go
out
of
my
life
but
my
darling
my
darling
i
wo
you
shall
never
have
it
to
say
that
your
mother
stood
in
your
way
i
must
think
however
of
what
your
father
will
say
to
this
i
can
only
warn
you
that
if
there
is
one
person
your
father
dreads
and
dislikes
more
than
another
it
is
the
modern
girl
he
said
to
me
god
effie
has
none
of
that
hideous
modernity
about
her
she
is
fairly
she
does
not
think
about
girton
or
newnham
or
any
of
the
women
colleges
in
short
she
has
no
advanced
ideas
that
is
all
he
knows
replied
effie
the
fact
is
i
must
and
will
do
something
to
earn
my
living
you
are
sending
george
out
into
the
world
to
win
his
spurs
and
i
am
going
to
win
mine
in
what
way
asked
staunton
you
know
you
are
not
clever
dorothy
thinks
i
can
be
a
nurse
mother
may
she
come
and
see
you
and
talk
it
all
over
there
is
no
harm
in
talking
it
over
said
staunton
but
now
i
wish
you
would
go
upstairs
and
help
susan
to
put
the
children
to
bed
you
can
bring
baby
downstairs
if
you
like
and
i
will
undress
him
run
along
effie
run
along
there
a
good
child
oh
yes
mother
i
go
only
just
answer
me
one
question
first
may
dorothy
come
here
after
supper
what
is
the
use
of
my
seeing
her
your
father
is
the
one
to
decide
i
will
ask
father
to
stay
in
after
supper
i
do
think
he
will
a
message
has
come
from
the
watson
people
over
at
the
farm
watson
was
taken
bad
with
a
stitch
an
hour
ago
and
they
want
your
father
as
quickly
as
he
can
go
well
he
will
be
back
in
time
he
wo
spend
the
whole
evening
there
anyhow
dorothy
can
come
and
see
you
and
if
father
does
come
in
before
she
leaves
well
and
good
i
may
run
and
tell
her
to
come
may
i
not
wo
you
put
the
children
to
bed
first
and
bring
me
baby
oh
yes
yes
if
you
insist
i
do
effie
while
you
are
at
home
you
must
help
me
all
you
can
i
have
not
had
a
bit
of
strength
since
baby
was
born
it
is
perfectly
dreadful
to
feel
all
your
strength
going
and
to
know
that
things
are
at
sixes
and
sevens
and
however
hard
you
try
you
can
not
put
them
right
dear
me
effie
i
did
think
when
you
were
grown
up
that
you
would
stay
at
home
and
be
a
comfort
to
me
i
shall
be
a
greater
comfort
to
you
when
i
send
you
money
from
london
now
do
speak
another
word
i
will
put
the
children
to
bed
and
i
will
look
after
baby
myself
while
you
close
your
eyes
and
go
to
sleep
effie
pressed
her
warm
young
lips
on
the
older
woman
brow
and
then
ran
out
of
the
room
there
was
a
large
nursery
upstairs
where
everything
at
the
present
moment
was
as
effie
mother
had
said
at
sixes
and
sevens
the
nursemaid
a
young
girl
of
seventeen
was
not
up
to
her
duties
the
children
ruled
her
instead
of
her
ruling
the
children
effie
however
could
be
masterful
enough
when
she
liked
she
had
a
natural
sense
of
order
and
she
soon
put
things
straight
in
the
nursery
the
children
were
undressed
quickly
and
put
to
bed
and
then
effie
taking
the
baby
in
her
arms
asked
susan
to
go
downstairs
you
can
have
your
supper
she
said
i
will
look
after
baby
i
thought
my
missus
would
like
me
to
take
baby
to
her
said
the
girl
no
i
will
look
after
him
for
the
present
said
effie
mother
is
tired
and
she
must
sleep
run
away
susan
and
have
your
supper
and
come
back
here
as
quickly
as
you
can
yes
miss
effie
and
i
am
sure
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
you
a
wonderful
way
with
the
children
and
i
only
wish
i
could
learn
it
susan
left
the
room
pressing
the
baby
soft
curly
head
against
her
breast
effie
began
to
pace
up
and
down
with
it
the
baby
was
three
months
old
he
was
fractious
and
disinclined
to
sleep
but
when
his
sister
began
to
purr
a
soft
song
into
his
ear
an
old
nursery
rhyme
which
her
mother
had
sung
to
her
long
ago
his
eyes
closed
and
he
sank
off
into
peaceful
slumber
when
she
saw
that
he
was
quite
sound
asleep
effie
put
him
in
his
cot
drew
the
cot
near
the
crib
where
philip
a
little
boy
of
five
lay
and
bending
down
to
kiss
phil
said
you
are
to
be
baby
nurse
until
susan
comes
up
if
he
wakes
or
begins
to
cry
just
pat
him
on
his
back
i
am
most
anxious
that
mother
should
have
a
quiet
time
she
is
just
worn
out
and
if
she
hears
baby
cry
she
is
certain
to
send
for
him
now
phil
you
are
a
very
clever
little
man
when
you
like
i
trust
to
you
to
keep
baby
from
crying
until
susan
comes
back
that
i
will
replied
phil
in
a
voice
of
intense
importance
i
do
love
effie
he
said
effie
kissed
him
and
softly
left
the
room
she
ran
downstairs
and
began
to
help
the
servant
to
lay
supper
no
one
could
look
more
bright
than
effie
as
she
performed
the
thousand
and
one
duties
which
fell
to
her
lot
in
this
poor
home
staunton
was
poor
there
were
six
children
effie
was
the
eldest
daughter
it
needs
no
more
words
to
explain
her
exact
position
from
morning
to
night
effie
was
busy
very
busy
doing
what
she
herself
called
nothing
she
was
getting
discontented
with
her
life
a
feeling
of
discontent
had
stolen
over
her
ever
since
her
eldest
brother
george
had
gone
to
london
to
help
his
uncle
in
a
large
warehouse
for
months
the
dream
of
her
life
was
to
give
up
the
little
duties
near
at
hand
and
to
take
some
great
duties
which
nobody
wanted
her
to
do
far
away
from
home
she
was
quite
prepared
for
the
advice
which
her
friend
dorothy
fraser
who
lived
all
the
year
round
in
london
and
only
came
home
for
the
holidays
to
whittingham
was
able
to
give
her
effie
conscience
was
not
in
the
least
pricked
at
the
thought
of
leaving
her
mother
it
seemed
to
her
quite
right
had
she
not
to
make
the
most
of
her
youth
why
should
she
spend
all
her
young
days
in
looking
after
the
children
and
making
things
tolerable
for
her
father
and
mother
these
thoughts
kept
swiftly
passing
through
her
brain
as
she
noiselessly
laid
the
table
and
made
it
look
charming
and
pretty
when
all
was
done
she
took
up
a
little
frock
of
one
of
the
children
and
sitting
down
by
the
window
began
to
work
her
pretty
dark
head
was
bent
over
her
task
her
thick
curling
lashes
lay
heavy
on
her
rounded
cheek
staunton
who
had
been
having
a
doze
on
the
sofa
started
up
now
and
looked
at
her
oh
effie
dear
i
have
had
such
a
nice
sleep
she
said
with
a
little
sigh
i
am
ever
so
much
the
better
for
it
but
what
have
you
done
with
baby
i
have
put
him
to
sleep
mother
he
is
in
his
cot
now
as
comfortable
as
possible
how
good
of
you
effie
what
a
comfort
you
are
to
me
effie
smiled
i
think
i
hear
father
coming
in
she
said
and
supper
is
quite
ready
staunton
started
up
from
the
sofa
she
pushed
back
her
tumbled
hair
and
shook
out
her
somewhat
untidy
dress
now
let
me
make
you
trim
said
effie
she
ran
over
to
her
parent
put
back
her
gray
hair
with
an
affectionate
little
touch
and
then
kissed
her
mother
on
her
flushed
cheeks
you
look
better
for
your
nice
sleep
mother
she
said
so
i
am
darling
and
for
your
loving
care
replied
staunton
her
husband
came
into
the
room
and
she
took
her
place
before
the
supper
at
the
stauntons
was
a
nondescript
sort
of
meal
it
consisted
of
meat
and
vegetables
and
tea
and
cakes
and
puddings
all
placed
on
the
table
together
it
was
the
one
hearty
meal
staunton
allowed
himself
in
the
hours
at
the
children
early
dinner
he
only
snatched
a
little
bread
and
cheese
but
at
peaceful
seven
the
children
were
in
bed
the
house
was
quiet
the
toil
of
the
day
was
supposed
to
be
over
and
staunton
could
eat
heartily
and
enjoy
himself
it
was
at
this
hour
he
used
to
notice
how
very
pretty
effie
looked
and
how
sweet
it
was
to
see
her
sitting
like
a
little
mouse
on
one
side
of
the
table
helping
him
and
his
wife
in
her
affectionate
way
and
seeing
to
the
comforts
of
all
it
did
not
occur
to
him
as
even
possible
that
effie
could
carry
such
a
dreadful
thing
as
rebellion
in
her
heart
no
face
could
look
more
perfectly
happy
than
hers
was
it
possible
that
she
was
pining
for
a
wider
field
of
usefulness
than
the
little
niche
which
she
filled
so
perfectly
in
the
home
life
staunton
never
thought
about
it
at
all
effie
was
just
a
dear
little
girl
not
a
bit
modern
she
was
the
comfort
of
her
mother
life
and
for
that
matter
the
comfort
of
his
also
he
looked
at
her
now
with
his
usual
grave
smile
well
effie
useful
and
charming
as
usual
i
see
you
have
not
forgotten
my
favorite
dish
and
i
am
glad
of
it
for
i
can
tell
you
i
am
just
starving
i
have
had
a
hard
day
work
and
it
is
nice
to
feel
that
i
can
rest
for
this
evening
at
least
have
you
been
to
the
watsons
dear
inquired
staunton
they
sent
a
message
for
you
two
or
three
hours
ago
yes
i
met
the
farmer
in
the
high
street
and
went
straight
out
to
the
farm
watson
is
better
now
poor
soul
but
it
is
a
bad
case
the
heart
is
a
good
deal
implicated
i
shall
have
to
go
out
there
again
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
it
would
be
a
dreadful
thing
for
that
family
if
anything
happened
to
her
the
heart
is
it
heart
trouble
said
staunton
yes
yes
do
you
begin
to
fancy
that
your
case
is
the
least
like
hers
yours
is
only
functional
hers
is
organic
now
why
have
i
broken
through
my
rule
of
saying
nothing
about
my
patients
you
will
be
fancying
and
fretting
all
night
that
you
are
going
to
shuffle
off
this
mortal
coil
just
as
quickly
as
poor
watson
will
have
to
do
before
long
i
fear
why
effie
what
is
the
matter
why
are
you
staring
at
me
with
those
round
eyes
staunton
looked
also
at
effie
and
the
sudden
memory
of
her
recent
conversation
with
her
returned
by
the
way
she
said
if
you
are
likely
to
be
at
home
this
evening
john
effie
would
like
to
ask
her
friend
dorothy
fraser
to
come
in
for
an
hour
or
two
she
wants
to
introduce
her
to
you
she
is
one
of
those
modern
girls
is
she
not
said
the
doctor
oh
father
she
is
just
splendid
said
effie
if
you
only
knew
her
if
you
could
hear
her
speak
well
my
dear
do
get
into
a
state
and
above
all
things
learn
that
dreadful
habit
of
exaggeration
i
dare
say
miss
fraser
is
very
well
but
there
are
few
prodigies
in
the
world
my
little
effie
and
for
my
part
give
me
the
home
birds
they
are
the
girls
for
my
world
they
are
the
girls
who
will
make
good
wives
by
and
by
there
my
love
i
shall
be
pleased
to
welcome
any
friend
of
yours
so
ask
her
over
by
all
means
she
wo
mind
the
old
doctor
pipe
i
hope
oh
no
father
effie
could
not
help
smiling
she
knew
perfectly
well
that
dorothy
thought
it
no
harm
to
indulge
in
a
tiny
cigarette
herself
not
often
nor
every
day
but
sometimes
when
she
was
dead
beat
as
she
expressed
it
effie
had
to
keep
this
knowledge
of
her
delinquencies
to
herself
if
staunton
knew
that
dorothy
did
not
consider
smoking
the
unpardonable
sin
in
woman
he
would
not
allow
her
inside
his
doors
i
will
go
and
fetch
her
effie
said
jumping
up
and
putting
on
her
hat
she
is
longing
to
know
you
father
and
you
can
smoke
two
or
three
pipes
while
she
is
here
effie
left
the
room
staunton
looked
at
her
husband
i
doubt
if
dorothy
fraser
is
the
best
of
friends
for
our
effie
eh
said
the
doctor
taking
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
for
a
moment
what
ails
the
girl
oh
nothing
at
all
replied
staunton
effie
is
very
fond
of
her
and
i
believe
she
really
is
a
fine
creature
you
know
she
is
educating
her
two
brothers
what
is
she
doing
how
does
she
earn
her
living
oh
she
is
a
nurse
in
a
hospital
she
has
been
in
joseph
hospital
for
years
and
is
now
superintendent
of
one
of
the
wards
she
gets
a
good
salary
the
doctor
rubbed
his
hands
together
in
a
somewhat
impatient
way
you
know
my
opinion
of
lady
nurses
he
said
looking
at
his
wife
well
dear
make
the
best
of
dorothy
for
effie
sake
i
hear
the
steps
of
the
two
girls
now
you
will
do
what
you
can
to
be
agreeable
you
no
said
the
doctor
i
shall
growl
like
a
bear
with
a
sore
head
when
i
see
women
who
ought
to
be
content
with
sweet
home
duties
struggling
and
pining
to
go
out
into
the
world
the
last
words
had
scarcely
left
the
doctor
lips
before
the
door
was
opened
and
effie
accompanied
by
her
friend
entered
the
room
dorothy
fraser
was
about
years
of
age
she
was
tall
she
had
a
fair
calm
sort
of
face
her
eyes
were
large
and
gray
her
mouth
sweet
she
had
a
way
of
taking
possession
of
those
she
spoke
to
and
she
had
not
been
two
minutes
in
the
shabby
little
before
and
staunton
were
looking
at
her
earnestly
and
listening
to
her
words
with
respect
dorothy
sat
near
staunton
i
am
very
glad
to
know
you
she
said
after
a
pause
effie
has
talked
to
me
over
and
over
again
about
you
may
i
ask
how
long
you
have
known
effie
interrupted
staunton
well
exactly
a
week
replied
miss
fraser
i
have
been
home
a
week
and
i
am
going
to
stay
another
week
i
met
effie
the
night
i
came
home
and
but
one
can
cultivate
a
friendship
in
a
week
do
you
think
so
dr
staunton
perhaps
perhaps
said
the
doctor
in
a
dubious
voice
i
am
slow
in
making
friends
myself
it
is
the
way
of
country
folk
oh
pray
do
speak
of
yourself
as
staunton
and
do
run
down
country
folk
i
see
so
many
of
them
at
the
hospital
for
my
part
i
think
they
are
worth
twenty
of
those
poor
london
people
who
are
half
starved
in
body
and
have
only
learned
the
wicked
side
of
life
poor
creatures
said
staunton
i
wish
you
would
tell
us
something
about
the
hospital
my
dear
it
is
vastly
entertaining
to
hear
all
about
sick
people
no
now
pardon
me
said
the
doctor
you
will
do
nothing
of
the
kind
miss
fraser
there
are
not
many
sick
folk
about
here
but
what
few
there
are
i
have
got
to
look
after
and
my
thoughts
are
bothered
enough
about
them
and
their
sicknesses
so
i
would
rather
if
you
please
turn
our
conversation
to
people
who
are
not
ill
the
wife
here
is
a
bit
nervous
too
and
she
is
never
the
better
for
hearing
people
talk
about
what
they
call
cases
i
think
it
is
the
worst
thing
in
the
world
for
people
to
keep
talking
of
their
maladies
or
even
about
other
maladies
my
motto
is
this
you
are
ill
try
and
see
how
soon
you
can
get
well
again
and
when
you
are
well
try
to
keep
so
never
think
of
illness
at
all
miss
fraser
looked
fully
at
the
doctor
while
he
was
talking
a
slight
frown
came
between
her
eyebrows
effie
bright
dark
eyes
were
fixed
on
her
friend
illness
interests
me
of
course
dorothy
said
after
a
pause
but
i
wo
talk
of
it
there
are
many
other
things
as
you
say
just
as
vital
well
at
any
rate
said
staunton
miss
fraser
can
tell
us
how
she
came
to
be
a
nurse
for
my
part
interrupted
staunton
i
think
it
is
a
great
pity
that
girls
like
you
miss
fraser
should
take
up
that
sort
of
life
lady
girls
are
not
suited
to
it
for
one
who
is
fitted
for
the
life
there
are
fifty
who
are
not
if
you
could
only
guess
how
doctors
hate
to
see
lady
nurses
in
possession
of
a
case
she
is
a
fine
lady
through
it
all
she
thinks
she
is
not
but
she
is
do
you
suppose
she
will
wash
up
the
cups
and
plates
and
spoons
as
they
ought
to
be
washed
and
kept
in
a
sick
person
room
and
do
you
fancy
she
will
clean
out
the
grate
and
go
down
on
her
knees
to
wash
the
floor
your
fine
lady
nurse
wo
there
is
a
case
of
infection
for
instance
measles
or
scarlet
fever
and
the
nurse
comes
down
from
london
and
she
is
supposed
to
take
possession
but
one
of
the
servants
of
the
house
has
to
go
in
to
clean
and
dust
and
arrange
or
the
sickroom
is
not
dusted
or
cleaned
at
all
that
is
your
lady
nurse
and
i
say
she
is
not
suited
to
the
work
miss
fraser
turned
pale
while
the
doctor
was
speaking
you
must
admit
she
said
when
he
stopped
and
looked
at
her
you
must
admit
staunton
that
every
lady
nurse
is
not
like
that
if
you
have
an
infection
case
in
your
practice
send
for
me
i
think
i
can
prove
to
you
that
there
are
some
ladies
who
are
too
truly
women
to
think
anything
menial
or
beneath
them
she
colored
as
she
spoke
and
lowered
her
eyes
the
conversation
drifted
into
other
channels
after
a
time
dorothy
got
up
and
went
away
and
effie
yawning
slightly
went
up
to
her
room
to
go
to
bed
she
slept
in
a
little
room
next
to
the
nursery
instead
of
undressing
at
once
as
was
her
wont
she
went
and
stood
by
the
window
threw
it
open
and
looked
out
what
would
father
say
if
he
knew
my
thoughts
she
said
to
herself
he
despises
ladies
who
are
nurses
he
thinks
it
wrong
for
any
lady
girl
to
go
away
from
home
but
i
am
going
yes
i
am
going
to
london
dorothy
is
my
friend
she
is
about
the
grandest
noblest
creature
i
ever
met
and
i
am
going
to
follow
in
her
steps
mother
will
consent
in
the
end
mother
will
see
that
i
can
not
throw
away
my
life
dear
mother
i
shall
miss
her
and
father
awfully
but
all
the
same
i
shall
be
delighted
to
go
i
do
want
to
get
out
of
this
narrow
narrow
life
i
do
want
to
do
something
big
and
grand
oh
dorothy
how
splendid
you
are
how
strong
you
look
how
delightful
it
is
to
feel
that
one
can
live
a
life
like
yours
and
do
good
and
be
loved
by
all
oh
dorothy
i
hope
i
shall
be
able
to
copy
you
i
hope
effie
eager
thoughts
came
to
a
sudden
stop
a
tall
dashed
down
the
street
and
pulled
up
short
at
her
father
door
a
young
man
in
a
norfolk
suit
jumped
out
threw
the
horse
reins
to
his
groom
and
pulled
the
doctor
bell
furiously
effie
leaned
slightly
out
of
her
window
in
order
to
see
who
it
was
she
recognized
the
man
who
stood
on
the
doorstep
with
a
start
of
surprise
and
the
color
flew
into
her
face
he
was
the
young
squire
of
the
neighborhood
his
name
was
harvey
his
place
was
two
miles
out
of
whittington
he
was
married
his
wife
was
the
most
beautiful
woman
effie
had
ever
seen
and
he
had
one
little
girl
the
harveys
were
rich
and
proud
they
spent
the
greater
part
of
their
time
in
london
and
had
never
before
condescended
to
consult
the
village
doctor
what
was
the
matter
now
effie
rushed
from
her
room
and
knocked
furiously
at
her
father
door
father
do
you
hear
the
are
you
getting
up
she
called
yes
child
yes
answered
the
doctor
the
bell
downstairs
kept
on
ringing
at
intervals
effie
stood
trembling
on
the
landing
she
felt
positively
sure
that
something
dreadful
must
have
happened
may
i
go
down
stairs
and
say
you
are
coming
father
she
called
again
through
the
yes
i
wish
you
would
say
i
will
be
downstairs
in
a
minute
effie
ran
off
she
took
the
chain
off
the
heavy
hall
door
and
threw
it
open
is
staunton
in
asked
the
squire
he
stared
at
effie
white
trembling
face
his
eyes
were
bloodshot
his
hair
in
disorder
he
looked
like
a
man
who
is
half
distracted
yes
said
effie
in
as
soothing
a
voice
as
she
could
assume
my
father
will
be
down
in
a
minute
harvey
took
off
his
cap
you
are
miss
staunton
i
presume
pray
ask
your
father
to
be
as
quick
as
possible
my
little
girl
is
ill
very
we
want
a
doctor
to
come
to
the
grange
without
a
moment
delay
all
right
squire
here
i
am
said
the
hearty
voice
of
staunton
on
the
stairs
the
squire
shook
hands
with
him
made
one
or
two
remarks
in
too
low
a
voice
for
effie
to
hear
sprang
into
his
the
doctor
scrambled
up
by
his
side
and
a
moment
later
the
two
had
disappeared
effie
stood
by
the
open
hall
door
looking
up
and
down
the
quiet
village
street
the
great
man
of
the
place
had
come
and
gone
like
a
flash
the
thing
staunton
had
longed
for
dreamed
of
and
almost
prayed
for
had
come
to
pass
at
last
her
husband
was
sent
for
to
the
grange
effie
wondered
if
fortune
were
really
turning
her
wheel
and
if
from
this
date
they
would
be
better
off
than
they
had
been
dorothy
fraser
people
lived
in
the
house
nearly
opposite
from
where
effie
stood
she
could
see
a
light
still
burning
in
her
friend
window
the
thought
of
dorothy
raised
the
girl
state
of
excitement
almost
to
fever
pitch
she
longed
to
go
over
and
see
her
friend
she
knew
she
must
not
do
that
however
she
shut
the
hall
door
and
went
slowly
back
to
her
bedroom
she
wanted
to
sleep
but
sleep
was
far
away
she
lay
listening
during
the
long
hours
of
the
summer
night
and
heard
hour
after
hour
strike
from
the
church
clock
close
by
between
two
and
three
in
the
morning
she
dropped
off
into
a
troubled
doze
she
awoke
in
broad
daylight
to
start
to
her
feet
and
see
her
father
standing
in
the
room
get
up
effie
he
said
i
want
you
dress
yourself
as
quickly
as
you
can
there
was
an
expression
about
his
face
which
prevented
effie
uttering
a
word
she
scrambled
into
her
clothes
he
waited
for
her
on
the
landing
when
she
was
dressed
he
took
her
hand
and
went
softly
down
through
the
house
i
do
not
want
your
mother
to
be
disturbed
he
said
there
is
a
very
bad
case
of
illness
at
the
grange
what
is
it
father
asked
effie
well
i
fear
that
it
is
a
complication
of
scarlet
fever
and
diphtheria
the
child
will
have
an
awful
fight
for
her
life
and
at
the
present
moment
i
am
afraid
the
odds
are
terribly
against
her
oh
father
and
she
is
the
only
child
said
effie
yes
yes
i
know
all
that
but
there
is
no
use
in
going
into
sentiment
just
now
the
thing
is
to
pull
her
through
if
possible
now
look
here
i
can
send
to
london
of
course
for
a
nurse
but
she
would
not
arrive
for
several
hours
do
you
think
your
friend
miss
fraser
would
undertake
the
case
yes
i
am
sure
she
would
said
effie
that
just
like
you
women
said
the
doctor
impatiently
you
jump
to
conclusions
without
knowing
anything
at
all
about
the
matter
the
child
case
is
horribly
infectious
in
fact
i
shall
be
surprised
if
the
illness
does
not
run
right
through
the
house
the
mother
has
been
sitting
up
with
this
baby
day
and
night
for
the
last
week
and
they
were
so
silly
they
never
sent
for
a
doctor
imagining
that
the
awful
state
of
the
throat
was
due
to
hoarseness
and
that
the
rash
was
what
they
were
pleased
to
call
heat
the
folly
of
some
people
is
enough
to
drive
any
reasonable
man
to
despair
they
send
for
the
doctor
forsooth
when
the
child
is
almost
in
the
grip
of
death
i
have
managed
to
relieve
her
a
bit
during
the
night
but
i
must
have
the
services
of
a
good
nurse
at
once
go
over
and
awake
miss
fraser
effie
and
bring
her
to
see
me
if
she
has
the
pluck
she
gave
me
to
understand
she
had
she
will
come
in
as
a
until
i
get
somebody
else
and
now
look
here
the
case
is
so
infectious
and
your
mother
is
so
weak
just
now
that
i
am
going
to
devote
myself
altogether
to
it
for
the
next
few
days
i
am
going
to
take
up
my
abode
at
the
grange
and
i
shall
wire
to
my
old
friend
edwards
to
look
after
the
rest
of
my
patients
there
are
only
half
a
dozen
to
be
seen
to
and
he
will
keep
them
quiet
until
i
am
free
again
now
go
over
and
bring
miss
fraser
for
me
to
see
i
have
driven
down
on
the
and
will
take
her
back
with
me
if
she
will
come
run
along
effie
and
wake
her
up
chapter
ii
dorothy
fraser
was
sound
asleep
when
effie
rushed
into
her
little
room
get
up
said
effie
shaking
her
friend
by
the
shoulder
as
a
nurse
miss
fraser
was
accustomed
to
unexpected
disturbances
she
opened
her
eyes
now
and
gazed
at
effie
for
a
bewildered
moment
then
she
sat
up
in
bed
and
pushed
back
her
heavy
hair
why
effie
she
exclaimed
what
do
you
want
i
fancied
i
was
back
at
joseph
and
that
one
of
the
nurses
had
got
into
trouble
and
had
come
to
me
but
i
find
i
am
at
home
for
the
holidays
surely
it
is
not
time
to
get
up
yet
it
is
only
five
said
effie
it
is
not
the
usual
time
to
get
up
but
dorothy
father
wants
you
there
is
a
bad
case
of
illness
at
the
grange
very
bad
indeed
and
father
is
nearly
distracted
and
he
wants
to
know
if
you
will
help
him
just
for
a
bit
why
of
course
cried
dorothy
i
shall
be
delighted
i
knew
you
would
i
knew
you
were
just
that
splendid
sort
of
a
girl
miss
fraser
knit
her
brows
in
some
perplexity
do
effie
she
said
i
wish
you
would
not
go
into
such
ecstasies
over
me
i
am
only
just
a
nurse
a
nurse

to
be
at
the
beck
and

minute

street
said
effie
the
fact

oh

exclaimed
dorothy
i
can
not
dress
while
you
stand
here
talking
whatever
it
is
i
will
be
with
your
father
in
two
or
three
minutes
effie
ran
downstairs
again
fraser
who
had
let
her
in
had
gone
back
to
bed
effie
shut
the
frasers
hall
door
as
quietly
as
she
could
she
then
went
across
the
sunlit
and
empty
street
to
where
her
father
stood
on
the
steps
at
his
own
door
the
groom
who
had
driven
the
doctor
over
was
standing
by
the
horse
head
at
a
little
distance
well
said
staunton
she
has
fought
shy
of
it
has
she
no
she
is
dressing
said
effie
she
will
be
down
in
a
minute
or
two
good
girl
said
staunton
you
did
happen
to
mention
the
nature
of
the
case
no
no
answered
effie
but
the
nature
of
the
case
wo
make
any
difference
to
her
the
doctor
pursed
up
his
mouth
as
if
he
meant
to
whistle
he
restrained
himself
however
and
stood
looking
down
the
street
after
a
time
he
turned
and
glanced
at
his
daughter
now
effie
he
said
you
must
do
all
you
can
for
your
mother
let
her
get
anxious
there
is
nothing
to
be
frightened
about
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
if
mortal
man
can
pull
the
child
through
i
will
do
it
but
i
must
have
no
home
cares
as
well
you
will
take
up
that
burden
eh
little
woman
i
will
try
father
said
effie
just
then
dorothy
appeared
she
had
dressed
herself
in
her
costume
gray
dress
gray
cloak
gray
bonnet
the
dress
suited
her
earnest
and
reposeful
face
she
crossed
the
road
with
a
firm
step
carrying
a
little
bag
in
her
hand
well
staunton
she
said
i
hear
you
have
got
a
case
for
me
the
doctor
gazed
at
her
for
a
moment
without
speaking
bless
me
he
exclaimed
it
is
a
comfort
to
see
a
person
like
you
in
the
place
and
so
you
are
really
willing
to
help
me
in
this
emergency
why
of
course
said
dorothy
i
am
a
nurse
but
you
do
know
the
nature
of
the
case
yet
i
do
see
that
that
makes
any
difference
but
will
you
tell
me
and
it
is
your
holiday
pursued
the
doctor
gazing
at
her
you
take
many
holidays
in
the
year
i
presume
i
have
had
a
week
and
i
am
quite
rested
said
dorothy
i
always
hold
my
life
in
readiness
she
continued
looking
up
at
him
with
a
flash
out
of
her
dark
blue
eyes
anywhere
at
any
time
when
i
am
called
i
am
ready
but
what
is
the
matter
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
i
want
you
to
help
me
to
pull
a
child
back
from
the
borders
of
death
a
child
i
love
children
said
dorothy
what
ails
the
child
she
has
acute
scarlet
fever
and
diphtheria
no
precautions
have
been
taken
with
regard
to
sanitation
she
is
the
child
of
rich
people
but
they
have
been
wantonly
neglectful
almost
cruel
in
their
negligence
and
ignorance
the
mother
a
young
woman
is
nearly
certain
to
take
the
complaint
and
to
complicate
everything
there
is
another
baby
expected
before
long
now
you
understand
if
you
get
into
that
house
you
are
scarcely
likely
to
go
out
of
it
again
for
some
time
dorothy
stood
grave
and
silent
oh
dorothy
is
it
right
for
you
to
go
exclaimed
effie
who
was
watching
her
friend
anxiously
yes
said
dorothy
it
is
right
they
may
possibly
be
obliged
to
fill
my
place
at
joseph
i
was
only
considering
that
point
for
a
moment
after
all
it
is
not
worth
troubling
about
i
am
at
your
service
staunton
we
may
require
one
or
two
other
nurses
to
help
us
if
things
are
as
bad
as
you
fear
god
bless
you
said
the
doctor
something
very
like
moisture
came
into
his
eyes
he
began
to
blow
his
nose
violently
now
effie
you
will
do
your
best
at
home
he
said
turning
to
his
daughter
this
way
please
miss
fraser
effie
dear
said
dorothy
she
kissed
her
friend
the
doctor
and
the
nurse
walked
toward
the
he
helped
her
to
mount
and
then
drove
rapidly
down
the
street
the
vehicle
was
soon
out
of
sight
i
wonder
what
father
will
think
of
dorothy
after
this
thought
effie
to
herself
the
feeling
that
her
father
would
really
approve
of
her
friend
gave
her
much
consolation
she
went
back
into
the
house
and
as
it
was
now
five
decided
that
it
was
not
worth
while
to
return
to
bed
there
was
always
plenty
to
be
done
in
this
little
house
with
its
overflowing
inhabitants
and
effie
found
heaps
to
occupy
her
until
it
was
time
to
go
into
the
nursery
to
help
the
little
nursemaid
with
her
various
duties
the
children
always
hailed
effie
with
a
scream
of
delight
they
were
not
a
bit
afraid
of
her
for
she
was
the
most
indulgent
elder
sister
in
the
world
but
all
the
same
she
managed
to
make
them
obey
her
susan
was
sent
downstairs
to
get
her
breakfast
while
effie
saw
the
elder
ones
safely
through
the
process
of
dressing
she
took
the
baby
on
her
knee
and
removing
his
put
him
into
his
bath
and
dressed
him
herself
quickly
and
expeditiously
she
then
carried
him
into
her
mother
room
staunton
had
spent
a
troubled
night
is
that
you
effie
she
exclaimed
looking
at
her
daughter
and
oh
there
is
baby
how
sweet
he
looks
what
a
splendid
nurse
you
are
my
darling
and
what
a
wonderful
comfort
to
me
give
me
my
dear
little
man
i
will
take
care
of
him
while
you
see
about
breakfast
how
are
you
this
morning
mother
asked
effie
have
you
had
a
good
night
yes
pretty
well
i
had
one
or
two
bad
dreams
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
poor
watson
and
that
your
father
spoke
about
i
wonder
how
she
is
this
morning
now
mother
dear
said
effie
you
know
father
said
you
were
not
to
dwell
upon
that
you
must
turn
your
thoughts
away
from
illness
of
every
sort
i
thought
we
might
go
for
a
little
drive
in
the
gig
this
morning
but
your
father
will
want
the
gig
no
that
just
it
he
wo
what
do
you
mean
surely
he
will
go
out
as
early
as
he
can
to
see
mrs
watson
no
mother
said
effie
he
wo
not
i
have
something
to
tell
you
now
please
do
be
frightened
there
is
nothing
to
be
frightened
about
staunton
was
half
sitting
up
in
bed
she
had
thrown
a
little
pale
blue
shawl
round
her
shoulders
and
held
the
pretty
baby
in
her
arms
she
was
a
remarkably
woman
a
really
woman
for
her
age
but
weakness
was
written
all
over
her
the
weakness
of
a
frail
although
loving
spirit
and
the
weakness
of
extreme
bodily
illness
for
she
was
ill
far
more
ill
than
her
children
knew
the
greatest
anxiety
of
the
honest
doctor
life
was
connected
with
his
wife
physical
condition
effie
looked
at
her
mother
now
and
something
of
the
fear
which
dwelt
in
her
father
heart
seemed
to
visit
her
i
have
something
to
tell
you
she
said
but
it
is
nothing
that
need
make
you
the
least
bit
afraid
father
has
left
you
in
my
charge
he
says
i
am
to
look
after
you
and
to
do
all
in
my
power
to
help
you
but
what
can
you
mean
effie
has
your
father
gone
away
not
really
away
replied
effie
for
he
is
close
to
us
and
can
come
back
if
necessary
at
any
moment
but
the
fact
is
this
if
all
is
well
father
is
not
coming
home
for
two
or
three
days
in
one
way
you
will
be
pleased
to
hear
this
mother
you
know
how
you
have
wished
him
to
be
called
in
at
the
grange
at
the
grange
exclaimed
staunton
starting
up
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
that
the
harveys
have
sent
for
your
father
yes
mother
i
do
and
is
not
that
good
news
the
little
girl
is
very
ill
and
squire
harvey
came
over
to
fetch
father
last
night
that
time
when
the
bell
rang
so
suddenly
i
remember
said
staunton
i
made
sure
that
someone
came
from
the
watsons
no
it
was
the
squire
who
called
squire
harvey
father
went
there
and
found
the
little
girl
very
ill
he
came
back
again
this
morning
and
took
dorothy
fraser
out
with
him
as
nurse
and
he
saw
me
and
he
asked
me
to
tell
you
that
he
would
stay
at
the
grange
for
a
couple
of
days
until
he
could
pull
the
child
through
and
you
are
on
no
account
to
expect
him
home
but
you
are
to
keep
as
well
and
cheerful
as
possible
for
his
sake
and
edwards
from
boltonville
is
to
take
father
work
for
the
time
so
you
see
continued
effie
in
conclusion
that
the
horse
and
gig
will
be
at
liberty
and
we
can
go
for
a
drive
i
thought
we
might
go
to
boltonville
and
take
baby
and
buy
some
fruit
for
preserving
there
are
sure
to
be
heaps
of
strawberries
at
the
bolton
farm
if
we
drive
over
early
all
the
time
effie
was
speaking
staunton
kept
gazing
at
her
as
the
eager
words
flowed
from
the
young
girl
lips
the
heart
of
the
mother
seemed
to
faint
within
her
you
she
said
after
a
pause
her
voice
trembled
no
words
could
come
for
an
instant
you
she
went
on
effie
you
have
not
told
me
what
ails
the
child
she
is
very
ill
mother
that
goes
without
saying
but
what
ails
her
why
should
not
your
father
come
home
effie
thought
for
a
moment
i
will
tell
about
the
scarlet
fever
but
not
about
the
diphtheria
she
said
to
herself
mother
is
always
so
terrified
about
diphtheria
ever
since
poor
little
johnny
died
of
it
long
long
ago
she
wo
mind
scarlet
fever
so
much
why
do
you
speak
effie
exclaimed
her
mother
you
terrify
me
with
your
grave
and
silent
way
there
is
nothing
to
be
terrified
about
mother
but
you
are
weak
and
therefore
you
get
unduly
nervous
i
was
only
thinking
for
a
moment
whether
you
had
better
know
but
of
course
if
you
wish
it
you
must
be
told
the
child
at
the
grange
is
suffering
from
scarlet
fever
do
you
think
it
will
spread
father
is
very
anxious
i
heard
him
telling
dorothy
that
harvey
had
been
very
imprudent
you
know
how
young
she
is
mother
and
how
beautiful
and
she
has
been
with
this
dear
little
child
day
and
night
from
the
beginning
not
knowing
in
the
least
what
ailed
her
and
harvey
is
expecting
another
baby
and
of
course
father
is
anxious
i
should
think
he
is
cried
staunton
drawn
completely
out
of
herself
by
the
tragedy
conveyed
in
these
words
oh
poor
young
thing
poor
young
mother
i
wish
i
were
strong
and
well
myself
that
i
might
go
and
help
her
she
will
have
a
bad
time
she
will
have
an
awful
risk
when
her
baby
arrives
effie
well
my
darling
we
can
do
nothing
but
pray
for
them
all
there
is
one
who
can
guide
us
even
through
dark
days
go
down
effie
and
get
breakfast
and
then
come
back
to
me
i
am
very
tired
this
morning
and
will
lie
still
for
a
little
now
that
i
have
got
such
a
dear
useful
daughter
to
take
my
place
for
me
effie
put
on
a
bright
smile
and
turned
toward
the
door
as
she
was
leaving
the
room
her
mother
called
out
after
her
there
is
one
good
thing
there
is
no
diphtheria
in
the
case
nothing
terrifies
me
like
that
effie
shut
the
door
hastily
without
reply
chapter
iii
meanwhile
staunton
and
dorothy
drove
quickly
to
the
grange
it
was
still
very
early
in
the
morning
and
when
they
arrived
at
the
great
hall
door
it
was
opened
by
squire
harvey
himself
that
right
dr
staunton
he
exclaimed
i
am
so
glad
you
have
come
oh
and
i
see
you
have
brought
a
nurse
what
a
blessing
now
perhaps
you
will
induce
my
wife
to
take
some
rest
how
lucky
that
you
were
able
to
find
a
nurse
in
a
little
place
like
whittington
i
am
very
fortunate
indeed
replied
the
doctor
in
his
hearty
voice
nurse
fraser
has
been
trained
at
joseph
and
happens
to
be
staying
at
whittington
for
a
brief
holiday
she
has
most
kindly
consented
to
undertake
the
case
until
we
can
get
fresh
assistance
from
london
i
will
stay
as
long
as
i
am
wanted
said
dorothy
in
her
quiet
voice
if
i
can
be
shown
to
a
room
for
a
moment
to
take
off
my
bonnet
and
cloak
i
will
go
immediately
afterward
to
the
little
patient
dorothy
voice
was
perfectly
cool
and
calm
she
did
not
speak
in
the
constrained
whisper
which
the
poor
squire
thought
it
right
to
use
there
was
an
everyday
tone
in
her
voice
which
at
this
moment
was
absolutely
refreshing
and
the
sympathy
in
her
blue
eyes
just
gave
the
right
quality
to
the
cool
tones
the
doctor
looked
at
her
with
unconcealed
admiration
that
girl
is
one
in
ten
thousand
he
said
to
himself
she
will
keep
us
all
on
our
mettle
i
can
see
but
there
is
plenty
of
heart
underneath
that
cool
exterior
the
great
luxurious
house
looked
neglected
and
wretched
although
the
father
and
mother
were
up
and
one
or
two
servants
were
assisting
in
the
sickroom
the
greater
number
of
the
servants
were
still
in
bed
there
was
no
one
to
take
miss
fraser
to
a
room
and
the
squire
looked
round
him
in
hopeless
bewilderment
dorothy
saw
at
a
glance
that
she
must
take
matters
into
her
own
hands
i
do
not
want
to
trouble
you
she
said
i
can
put
my
cloak
and
bonnet
in
here
i
should
like
to
put
on
my
cap
and
apron
before
i
go
upstairs
she
opened
a
door
as
she
spoke
and
went
into
a
room
where
all
the
blinds
were
down
took
off
her
outdoor
things
and
taking
a
cap
out
of
her
bag
slipped
it
over
her
hair
tied
on
a
white
apron
and
then
stood
ready
and
capable
and
fresh
and
bright
before
the
squire
and
the
doctor
now
come
straight
upstairs
with
me
said
the
doctor
they
went
up
together
squire
harvey
followed
them
at
a
distance
when
the
doctor
reached
the
first
landing
he
opened
a
green
baize
door
shut
it
behind
him
and
walked
down
a
long
cool
corridor
which
led
in
the
direction
of
the
nurseries
now
look
here
he
said
turning
and
facing
dorothy
the
great
thing
that
we
have
both
to
do
is
to
keep
this
terrible
disease
from
spreading
one
or
two
of
the
servants
have
been
with
the
case
from
the
first
the
father
and
mother
have
been
in
and
out
of
the
room
as
freely
and
unconstrainedly
as
if
the
child
had
only
a
cold
the
matter
with
her
if
they
are
likely
to
take
the
infection
the
mischief
is
probably
done
already
but
on
the
chance
of
this
not
being
so
i
shall
beg
of
the
squire
to
come
into
this
part
of
the
house
as
seldom
as
possible
and
as
to
harvey
she
must
be
got
away
that
is
your
task
nurse
you
will
allow
me
to
call
you
nurse
wo
you
certainly
call
me
nurse
dorothy
i
like
that
name
best
i
am
called
that
by
the
children
at
st
joseph
very
well
i
am
sure
you
will
be
a
blessing
here
but
a
great
deal
of
tact
must
be
used
the
position
of
affairs
is
extremely
difficult
i
will
do
my
best
replied
the
nurse
the
doctor
gave
her
another
look
of
complete
satisfaction
and
they
entered
the
room
where
the
little
patient
lay
between
life
and
death
a
small
cot
had
been
drawn
almost
into
the
center
of
the
room
the
blinds
were
down
there
was
a
sense
of
desolation
and
a
heavy
smell
in
the
air
who
has
shut
these
windows
said
the
doctor
in
a
voice
of
disapproval
he
went
straight
across
the
room
drew
up
one
of
the
blinds
and
opened
the
window
two
or
three
inches
a
fresh
current
of
air
immediately
improved
the
close
atmosphere
when
he
spoke
and
when
he
and
nurse
fraser
came
into
the
room
a
young
woman
who
was
on
her
knees
by
the
side
of
the
cot
started
up
suddenly
and
gazed
at
them
out
of
a
pair
of
wide
blue
eyes
her
cheeks
were
deeply
flushed
her
lips
were
parched
and
dry
oh
doctor
she
said
staggering
toward
staunton
you
have
come
back
what
a
blessing
she
is
asleep
now
perhaps
she
is
better
the
doctor
went
over
and
looked
at
the
child
she
was
a
little
creature
of
not
more
than
five
years
of
age
in
health
she
may
have
been
pretty
she
probably
was
but
now
the
shadowy
little
face
the
emaciated
hands
the
hot
dry
cracked
lips
were
the
reverse
of
beautiful
they
were
all
that
was
pathetic
however
and
dorothy
heart
went
straight
out
to
the
baby
who
lay
there
in
such
suffering
and
weakness
the
doctor
looked
at
her
and
gave
a
significant
glance
toward
harvey
dorothy
took
her
cue
at
once
i
have
come
to
nurse
your
dear
little
girl
madam
she
said
staunton
has
brought
me
i
have
a
great
deal
of
experience
as
i
am
superintendent
of
one
of
the
children
wards
at
joseph
hospital
i
think
you
may
trust
your
little
girl
to
me
but
first
of
all
let
me
take
you
to
your
room
and
put
you
to
bed
put
me
to
bed
said
harvey
with
a
laugh
which
jarred
on
everyone
nerves
i
have
not
been
in
bed
for
nights
i
could
not
sleep
when
the
doctor
tells
me
that
freda
is
out
of
danger
then
i
may
be
able
to
sleep
but
not
before
not
before
whether
you
sleep
or
not
continued
dorothy
you
must
come
and
lie
down
you
are
completely
worn
out
and
can
do
no
good
whatever
to
the
child
in
your
present
condition
while
she
sleeps
it
is
surely
right
that
you
should
sleep
too
come
i
will
promise
to
call
you
if
you
are
wanted
yes
dear
madam
let
me
entreat
of
you
to
go
to
bed
said
the
doctor
the
door
was
opened
at
this
moment
and
the
squire
came
in
now
elfreda
he
said
coming
up
to
his
wife
you
will
go
and
take
some
rest
wo
you
she
looked
from
him
to
the
nurse
and
from
the
nurse
to
the
doctor
and
then
her
tired
bright
eyes
fell
upon
the
little
parched
face
lying
on
the
pillow
i
know
she
is
going
to
die
she
said
with
a
kind
of
broken
sob
i
can
not
leave
her
how
can
anyone
dare
to
ask
me
to
leave
my
little
child
just
now
her
agitation
became
more
terrible
each
moment
she
was
evidently
on
the
verge
of
hysterics
dorothy
walked
straight
from
the
nursery
to
a
sort
of
which
lay
beyond
there
was
a
small
bed
there
which
was
sometimes
occupied
by
the
a
tired
young
woman
was
standing
in
this
room
dorothy
gave
her
quick
directions
get
clean
sheets
and
make
this
bed
up
immediately
she
said
the
girl
started
but
looked
relieved
at
having
anything
explicit
to
do
she
ran
off
to
obey
and
dorothy
came
back
to
the
sickroom
hush
she
said
going
up
to
harvey
who
was
standing
shaking
from
head
to
foot
with
dry
sobs
you
must
not
give
way
like
this
it
is
very
wrong
remember
you
have
not
only
yourself
to
think
of
she
bent
forward
and
whispered
a
word
in
the
young
mother
ear
harvey
started
and
with
a
violent
effort
controlled
herself
i
see
that
you
must
not
be
separated
from
your
child
continued
dorothy
at
least
not
at
present
i
am
having
a
bed
made
up
for
you
in
the
where
you
will
be
within
call
ah
yes
that
better
said
the
poor
lady
that
much
better
come
then
at
once
said
dorothy
she
held
out
her
hand
harvey
crossed
the
room
she
and
dorothy
disappeared
into
the
in
ten
minutes
the
nurse
came
back
to
staunton
i
have
undressed
her
and
she
is
in
bed
she
said
she
is
very
weak
and
in
a
terribly
nervous
condition
she
ought
to
sleep
for
hours
will
you
prepare
a
composing
draught
for
her
it
once
yes
said
the
doctor
i
have
brought
some
medicines
with
me
he
went
out
of
the
room
and
returned
in
a
minute
or
two
with
a
small
dose
in
a
glass
dorothy
took
it
into
the
harvey
tired
eyes
were
shut
already
now
you
to
drink
this
said
dorothy
raising
her
head
slightly
drink
this
do
open
your
eyes
trust
lean
on
me
if
you
like
believe
me
that
nothing
would
induce
me
not
to
call
you
if
your
child
were
in
real
danger
but
you
must
sleep
now
sleep
and
try
to
believe
that
all
will
be
well
you
comfort
me
nurse
said
harvey
you
are
strong
i
somehow
believe
in
you
you
may
do
so
said
dorothy
she
bent
down
and
kissed
the
hot
lips
she
absolutely
forgot
that
she
was
only
the
nurse
and
that
the
tired
woman
in
the
bed
was
a
lady
of
high
position
at
such
a
moment
as
this
they
were
only
two
women
two
sisters
dorothy
waited
for
a
moment
to
see
the
sleeping
draught
take
effect
then
drawing
down
the
blind
she
left
the
room
closing
the
door
softly
behind
her
when
she
returned
to
the
nursery
staunton
was
bending
over
little
freda
who
had
opened
her
eyes
and
was
moaning
in
terrible
pain
the
fever
is
better
he
said
turning
to
the
nurse
the
feverish
stage
is
over
and
of
course
although
we
may
expect
and
must
guard
against
complications
there
is
no
reason
why
the
child
should
not
do
well
as
far
as
that
is
concerned
but
the
state
of
the
throat
is
the
real
anxiety
i
do
not
like
to
suggest
such
a
terrible
operation
as
tracheotomy
but
if
the
child
does
not
get
relief
before
long
i
fear
there
is
no
help
for
it
and
it
must
be
performed
dorothy
bent
down
and
examined
the
little
patient
carefully
i
have
had
a
good
deal
of
experience
in
these
cases
she
said
after
a
pause
and
have
found
she
mentioned
a
certain
remedy
which
could
be
inhaled
work
wonders
especially
in
the
cases
of
children
i
have
not
heard
of
it
said
staunton
knitting
his
brows
in
anxiety
but
it
sounds
simple
and
i
see
no
harm
in
trying
it
it
is
very
simple
said
dorothy
i
should
like
to
try
it
the
child
moaned
and
tossed
on
her
pillow
the
doctor
went
out
of
the
room
to
prepare
the
medicine
which
the
nurse
had
recommended
and
dorothy
called
one
of
the
frightened
servants
to
her
side
she
told
her
that
she
meant
to
take
the
child
up
and
walk
about
the
room
with
her
in
her
arms
while
she
is
out
of
bed
i
will
have
the
windows
closed
said
the
nurse
and
of
course
she
must
be
well
wrapped
up
in
blankets
she
may
drop
off
to
sleep
again
in
my
arms
anyhow
the
change
of
position
and
the
slight
movement
will
be
most
refreshing
to
her
will
you
make
the
bed
and
put
on
clean
sheets
while
i
am
walking
about
with
the
child
the
girl
promised
to
obey
it
is
very
infectious
ai
it
miss
she
said
suddenly
it
is
in
god
hands
replied
the
nurse
there
was
a
sound
in
her
voice
a
sort
of
thrill
of
strength
which
subjugated
the
girl
at
once
and
made
her
forget
her
fears
she
obeyed
the
nurse
directions
with
a
will
and
when
in
an
hour
time
staunton
returned
with
the
remedy
which
nurse
dorothy
had
suggested
he
scarcely
knew
the
sickroom
the
little
child
had
been
laid
back
again
in
bed
her
long
hair
was
combed
away
from
her
pale
worn
face
dorothy
had
plaited
it
neatly
the
little
face
was
washed
and
looked
almost
cool
compared
with
its
old
flushed
and
weary
condition
the
bed
was
neat
and
in
perfect
order
with
snowy
sheets
the
tired
little
head
rested
on
a
cool
pillow
dorothy
and
the
maid
had
removed
the
carpets
from
the
floor
and
the
room
was
sprinkled
with
a
disinfectant
two
of
the
windows
were
open
and
a
faint
sweet
breath
of
air
from
the
garden
outside
blew
into
the
room
why
nurse
this
is
an
admirable
change
said
the
doctor
it
is
necessary
replied
nurse
dorothy
there
is
no
chance
of
recovery
without
fresh
air
and
a
cool
quiet
calm
atmosphere
i
think
rhoda
she
looked
at
the
servant
as
she
spoke
will
help
me
with
this
case
and
i
should
like
as
few
other
people
as
possible
in
the
room
i
have
promised
harvey
to
call
her
if
there
is
any
change
for
the
worse
in
the
child
but
my
impression
is
she
will
soon
be
better
god
grant
it
said
the
doctor
what
a
blessing
a
good
nurse
is
he
thought
as
he
went
off
to
the
room
which
had
been
prepared
for
him
and
where
he
was
glad
to
take
an
hour
or
two
of
rest
chapter
iv
all
through
the
long
hours
of
that
day
dorothy
watched
by
the
sick
child
the
child
was
on
the
borderland
her
life
hung
in
the
balance
a
feather
weight
on
either
side
and
she
would
go
to
the
country
from
which
there
is
no
return
or
she
would
become
well
again
efforts
were
directed
to
turning
the
balance
in
the
scale
toward
life
notwithstanding
all
her
care
however
and
all
the
alleviations
which
she
used
the
sick
child
suffered
and
moaned
terribly
the
awful
state
of
the
throat
the
terrible
prostration
caused
by
this
form
of
blood
poisoning
were
no
light
foes
to
have
to
beat
and
conquer
but
unceasing
care
presently
produced
a
happy
result
and
toward
evening
the
high
temperature
went
down
a
couple
of
degrees
and
the
child
breathing
became
less
difficult
i
believe
she
will
recover
said
dorothy
looking
at
staunton
who
had
just
come
into
the
room
i
hope
you
agree
with
me
doctor
in
thinking
that
she
is
rather
better
yes
replied
the
doctor
she
is
better
she
is
less
feverish
and
her
breathing
is
easier
you
have
done
wonders
already
what
happy
news
for
her
poor
mother
i
am
so
glad
that
i
can
tell
her
that
the
child
is
really
better
said
dorothy
i
want
to
induce
her
to
give
the
little
creature
altogether
into
my
care
for
the
present
and
not
to
come
near
her
again
unless
a
change
for
the
worse
should
set
in
i
hear
harvey
stirring
now
in
the
next
room
so
she
may
be
in
at
any
moment
may
i
speak
to
her
doctor
do
you
give
me
leave
to
tell
her
that
her
child
is
on
the
mend
and
that
you
would
rather
she
kept
out
of
the
room
i
would
do
anything
in
the
world
to
keep
her
out
of
the
room
said
the
doctor
yes
i
give
you
full
leave
to
say
what
you
please
you
would
have
more
influence
with
her
than
i
should
have
i
am
almost
as
great
a
stranger
to
her
as
you
are
use
your
strongest
influence
nurse
do
what
you
can
i
believe
in
you
i
am
sure
she
will
do
the
same
i
go
into
the
day
nursery
and
wash
my
hands
before
i
see
harvey
said
dorothy
she
was
scarcely
a
moment
away
in
a
couple
of
minutes
she
was
standing
by
harvey
bed
exhausted
by
her
days
and
nights
of
watching
the
mother
had
slept
all
through
the
long
hours
of
the
day
she
opened
her
eyes
now
with
a
start
healing
sleep
had
done
wonders
for
her
the
dewy
look
of
youth
had
come
back
to
her
face
her
beautiful
blue
eyes
were
fixed
for
a
moment
on
dorothy
with
a
puzzled
expression
of
where
am
i
what
has
happened
she
asked
in
a
startled
voice
you
have
just
had
a
lovely
sleep
said
dorothy
you
be
all
the
better
for
it
and
who
are
you
i
can
not
quite
collect
my
thoughts
i
know
something
has
happened

are
you
i
can
not
remember
you

am
the
nurse
who
is
taking
care
of
your
dear
little
girl

is
better

said
harvey
she
sat
up
in
bed
and
clasped
her
hands
tightly

was
wrong
of
me
to
sleep
so
long
she
said
but
i
wo
be
a
moment
getting
dressed
i
must
go
back
to
the
child
at
once
will

come
to

room

dorothy

evening

a
week

depths
truly
yes

i
recollect
it
all
my
little
child
my
only
little
child
my
darling
my
treasure
oh
nurse

allowed
me
to

should
have
called

may
have
been
wanting
me
but
you
say

perhaps
staunton
oh
i

from
me
oh
my
head
my
poor
head

shall
go
mad

my
senses

harvey
said
dorothy
i
have
good
news
for
you
not
bad
freda
is
really
better
she
is
less
feverish
and
her
throat
does
not
hurt
her
so
badly
i
do
pretend
that
she
is
yet
out
of
danger
but
if
she
continues
to
improve
as
she
has
done
during
the
last
seven
or
eight
hours
she
will
be
out
of
danger
before
long
now
i
want
you
to
take
care
of
yourself
and
to
trust
your
child
to
me

i
can
not
give
the
child
up
to
anyone
you
must
not
keep
me
from
her
another
moment
i
am
not
a
bit
hungry
but
i
have
something
to
eat
in
her
room
if

it
to
me

my
darling

have
missed
me

such
a
child
for
her
mother

a
mother

her
child

mrs
harvey
poor
harvey
dazed
and
frightened
eyes
gazed
into
dorothy
strong
face
its
repose
its
calm
impressed
her
she
was
in
an
overstrung
and
highly
hysterical
state
she
burst
into
tears
i
do
trust
you
nurse
she
said
with
a
great
sob
i
trust
you
and
i
bless
you
i
know
my
dear
little
one
is
better
oh
thank
god
thank
the
great
and
good
god
but
dear
nurse
i
must
go
to
her
you
are
tired
and
i
am
quite
rested
and
refreshed
i
spend
the
night
with
the
child
and
you
can
go
to
bed
no
dear
madam
i
can
not
resign
the
care
of
the
child
to
anyone
i
am
using
a
certain
remedy
in
the
form
of
a
spray
which
no
one
in
this
house
understands
but
me
if
that
remedy
which
has
made
the
child
better
is
not
continued
unceasingly
during
the
whole
of
this
night
her
throat
will
get
as
bad
as
ever
and
there
will
be
no
hope
of
her
recovery
i
want
you
harvey
to
sleep
and
leave
the
child
in
my
care
i
wish
this
and
the
doctor
wishes
it
and
i
am
sure
if
you
asked
your
husband
he
would
tell
you
that
he
wished
the
same
you
are
not
required
to
do
anything
for
little
freda
and
it
is
your
duty
to
take
care
of
yourself
if
she
gets
worse
i
promise
to
come
for
you
i
promise
this
harvey
now
will
you
go
to
your
room
and
dress
and
then
go
downstairs
and
have
some
dinner
in
the
morning
i
expect
to
have
splendid
news
for
you
harvey
clasped
her
hands
in
perplexity
and
uncertainty
it
is
dreadful
to
keep
a
mother
from
her
child
she
said
and
yet
and
yet
and
yet
in
this
case
it
is
right
said
dorothy
you
must
remember
that
you
have
not
only
freda
to
think
of
there
is
your
husband
and
oh
yes
i
know
there
is
my
poor
little
unhappy
baby
but
i
can
not
love
it
as
i
love
freda
still
you
owe
it
a
duty
it
is
not
right
of
you
to
do
anything
to
risk
its
life
or
your
own
when
it
comes
to
you
you
will
see
how
dearly
you
love
it
now
please
let
me
take
you
to
your
room
but
may
i
not
take
one
peep
at
my
little
treasure
she
is
asleep
just
now
and
you
may
wake
her
please
let
me
take
you
to
your
room
harvey
staggered
to
her
feet
i
trust
you
nurse
she
said
with
a
wistful
sort
of
look
you
will
remember
your
promise
i
will
nothing
in
the
world
will
make
me
go
back
from
my
word
now
come
with
me
dorothy
led
harvey
away
they
walked
down
the
corridor
together
the
nurse
opened
a
baize
door
which
shut
away
the
nurseries
from
the
rest
of
the
house
and
a
moment
later
found
herself
standing
in
harvey
luxurious
bedroom
her
maid
was
there
and
dorothy
asked
her
to
help
her
mistress
to
dress
what
dress
will
you
wear
madam
asked
the
girl
anything
it
does
matter
what
replied
harvey
yes
it
matters
a
great
deal
said
dorothy
you
ought
to
wear
a
pretty
dress
i
think
it
is
your
duty
to
do
so
you
have
got
to
think
of
the
squire
nothing
will
please
him
and
reassure
him
more
than
to
see
you
coming
down
to
dinner
looking
bright
and
pretty
in
one
of
your
nice
dresses
really
nurse
you
amaze
me
began
harvey
but
then
the
shadow
of
a
smile
crept
into
her
eyes
i
do
think
you
would
talk
like
that
if
you
did
not
really
think
freda
would
get
well
she
exclaimed
suddenly
my
impression
is
that
she
will
get
well
replied
dorothy
now
please
put
on
one
of
your
pretty
dresses
that
pink
dress
with
the
lace
ruffles
martin
said
harvey
turning
to
the
maid
she
got
up
as
she
spoke
walked
across
the
room
and
put
her
arms
round
dorothy
white
neck
you
are
a
very
brave
woman
she
said
you
are
someone
to
lean
on
it
rests
me
to
lean
on
you
i
love
you
already
and
i
love
you
said
dorothy
in
her
simple
direct
fashion
god
has
given
you
to
me
to
take
care
of
just
now
and
i
fully
believe
that
your
sweet
little
girl
will
be
spared
to
you
now
i
see
you
are
going
to
be
very
brave
and
good
yourself
and
i
go
back
to
the
child
i
ought
not
to
be
too
long
away
from
her
all
through
the
night
that
followed
the
nurse
persevered
in
the
remedies
which
were
slowly
but
surely
undermining
the
awful
blood
poisoning
slowly
but
surely
as
the
hours
advanced
the
fell
disease
lost
its
power
the
choking
sensation
grew
less
and
less
in
the
throat
the
horrible
membrane
became
absorbed
and
the
child
exhausted
worn
to
a
little
shadow
dropped
toward
morning
into
a
peaceful
and
natural
sleep
from
my
heart
i
believe
i
have
conquered
thought
dorothy
she
sank
on
her
knees
by
the
bedside
she
felt
herself
never
before
had
she
nursed
a
case
like
this
never
before
had
she
gone
through
such
a
fight
with
death
the
child
was
far
gone
when
she
arrived
the
diphtheria
was
particularly
acute
and
the
poor
little
frame
was
already
terribly
weakened
by
the
sharp
attack
of
scarlet
fever
another
twelve
hours
and
nothing
would
have
saved
her
murmured
dorothy
oh
i
thank
thee
my
god
i
thank
thee
for
this
mercy
oh
what
a
joy
it
is
to
feel
that
i
can
give
this
child
back
to
her
mother
dorothy
remained
by
the
bedside
her
head
was
bowed
on
her
hands
someone
touched
her
on
her
shoulder
she
looked
up
and
met
the
keen
eyes
of
staunton
he
was
looking
dreadfully
pale
and
tired
himself
see
said
dorothy
rising
and
pointing
to
the
child
she
is
not
feverish
now
she
sleeps
sweetly
she
will
recover
said
the
doctor
thank
the
almighty
i
believe
she
will
certainly
recover
replied
dorothy
it
is
your
doing
nurse
with
god
blessing
she
answered
bowing
her
head
the
doctor
asked
her
one
or
two
more
questions
now
the
thing
is
to
keep
up
her
strength
said
dorothy
in
conclusion
she
must
have
every
imaginable
form
of
nourishment
but
that
can
be
done
for
i
mean
to
undertake
the
management
of
her
food
myself
please
staunton
will
you
tell
harvey
the
good
news
that
her
child
is
out
of
danger
yes
said
the
doctor
but
ought
not
that
to
be
your
own
reward
no
no
i
do
want
to
go
near
her
i
wish
you
to
do
all
in
your
power
to
keep
her
from
the
room
i
believe
that
when
she
knows
that
her
child
is
really
on
the
mend
she
will
be
guided
by
your
wishes
and
those
of
her
husband
i
have
a
kind
of
feeling
i
may
be
wrong
of
course
but
i
have
a
kind
of
feeling
that
god
will
stay
his
hand
in
this
matter
and
that
the
plague
will
not
spread
now
the
thing
is
to
think
of
the
mother
i
suppose
you
will
attend
to
her
when
her
baby
is
born
she
has
asked
me
to
do
so
then
do
you
think
said
dorothy
after
a
pause
for
reflection
do
you
think
you
might
leave
little
freda
to
me
i
am
willing
to
be
shut
up
in
this
part
of
the
house
with
the
child
and
one
of
the
maids
a
girl
called
rhoda
who
has
been
most
helpful
to
me
during
the
last
hours
if
you
are
wanted
doctor
you
are
on
the
spot
but
unless
there
is
occasion
do
you
think
it
would
be
best
for
you
not
to
come
into
this
room
it
would
be
certainly
the
safest
course
as
regards
the
mother
pursued
the
doctor
in
a
thoughtful
tone
you
are
a
wonderful
woman
nurse
go
and
consult
the
squire
chapter
one
day
a
week
after
the
events
related
in
the
last
chapter
staunton
suddenly
walked
into
the
little
parlor
where
effie
and
her
mother
were
sitting
together
effie
sprang
up
at
sight
of
him
some
needlework
over
which
she
had
been
busy
fell
to
the
floor
a
rush
of
color
came
into
her
cheeks
oh
father
father
she
exclaimed
how
delightful
it
is
to
see
you
again
oh
how
glad
we
are
is
little
freda
really
better
how
is
harvey
and
have
you
come
back
to
stay
father
i
ca
answer
such
a
lot
of
questions
all
together
child
said
the
doctor
with
a
smile
yes
i
have
come
home
to
stay
the
fact
is
i
am
tired
out
and
simply
with
doing
nothing
ever
since
that
blessed
angel
of
a
woman
dorothy
fraser
came
to
the
grange
there
has
been
little
or
nothing
for
me
to
do
yes
that
a
fact
i
am
with
doing
nothing
i
should
like
a
cup
of
tea
beyond
anything
make
it
strong
for
me
my
dear
strong
and
fragrant
the
kettle
is
boiling
said
effie
i
wo
be
a
minute
oh
it
is
delightful
to
have
you
back
she
ran
out
of
the
room
shutting
the
door
softly
behind
her
staunton
went
over
and
sat
on
the
sofa
by
his
wife
at
last
my
darling
he
said
putting
his
arms
round
her
i
am
safe
back
again
you
see
that
for
yourself
thank
god
thank
god
john
replied
staunton
i
have
missed
you
she
repeated
she
held
out
both
her
thin
hands
the
doctor
put
his
own
strong
sinewy
hands
round
them
he
clasped
them
tightly
oh
how
hot
you
are
she
said
starting
back
and
looking
anxiously
at
him
your
fingers
almost
burn
me
i
am
simply
tired
that
all
he
replied
tired
out
with
doing
nothing
i
do
believe
the
grange
is
a
wholesome
place
it
is
big
and
grand
and
richly
furnished
but
the
air
does
not
suit
me
i
suspect
there
is
something
wrong
with
the
drains
the
drains
are
probably
at
the
root
of
all
this
mischief
to
poor
little
freda
but
let
us
forget
all
that
now
let
me
look
at
you
wife
how
are
you
why
you
look
bonnie
bonnie
he
stretched
out
his
hand
and
passed
it
gently
over
his
wife
faded
cheek
i
have
been
thinking
of
you
morning
noon
and
night
he
said
you
have
never
been
out
of
my
thoughts
for
a
moment
you
and
the
children
that
dear
little
effie
in
particular
but
the
other
children
too
i
had
time
to
pause
and
consider
during
those
days
of
waiting
at
the
grange
and
i
could
not
help
remembering
that
if
anything
happened
to
me
there
were
five
children
unprovided
for
five
children
and
you
mary
with
the
strength
of
a
mouse
in
you
that
all
you
know
replied
staunton
with
a
little
show
of
spirit
i
am
better
i
have
made
wonderful
progress
during
the
last
few
days
you
ca
think
what
a
good
nurse
effie
has
been
the
most
considerate
the
most
thoughtful
the
most
kind
and
clever
darling
you
can
possibly
imagine
she
manages
the
whole
house
our
servants
would
do
anything
for
her
and
the
children
love
her
so
much
that
it
is
a
pleasure
to
them
to
obey
her
she
has
that
wonderful
and
invaluable
knack
in
a
woman
she
never
teases
or
worries
she
just
contrives
to
turn
people
round
her
little
finger
without
their
knowing
anything
about
it
themselves
but
now
do
let
us
talk
any
more
about
effie
and
me
i
want
to
hear
your
news
how
is
harvey
how
has
she
borne
the
death
of
her
poor
little
baby
it
lived
just
two
hours
after
its
birth
said
the
doctor
with
a
sad
look
on
his
face
the
shock
the
poor
mother
underwent
evidently
had
some
effect
upon
it
well
she
is
getting
on
splendidly
she
seemed
to
know
from
the
first
that
her
poor
little
baby
would
not
live
but
as
freda
is
doing
so
well
not
a
murmuring
word
has
passed
her
lips
she
is
a
sweet
young
woman
and
i
am
thankful
to
say
i
do
believe
she
took
a
scrap
of
infection
from
poor
little
freda
and
the
little
one
is
she
continuing
to
get
better
she
is
doing
magnificently
thanks
to
that
fine
creature
dorothy
fraser
i
never
came
across
such
a
woman
if
you
only
saw
mary
the
state
of
hopeless
confusion
of
pandemonium
for
it
really
amounted
to
that
of
that
wretched
house
the
morning
miss
fraser
arrived
if
you
could
only
have
seen
the
condition
of
the
sickroom
and
then
have
gone
into
it
two
hours
later
why
it
was
like
stepping
from
the
infernal
regions
into
paradise
the
order
of
the
sickroom
seemed
to
affect
the
whole
house
the
servants
ceased
to
be
in
a
state
of
panic
the
meals
were
properly
cooked
the
squire
came
back
to
his
normal
condition
and
harvey
became
quite
cheerful
in
short
except
for
the
loss
of
her
poor
little
one
she
seems
to
have
had
no
ill
effects
from
the
terrible
strain
she
has
undergone
little
freda
is
making
rapid
marches
toward
recovery
and
i
do
not
at
present
see
the
slightest
trace
of
the
disease
spreading
through
the
house
have
you
seen
freda
often
asked
staunton
no
that
good
soul
simply
forbade
it
i
was
like
wax
in
her
hands
of
course
her
reason
was
a
very
legitimate
one
or
i
should
not
have
submitted
to
it
for
it
would
not
have
been
safe
for
me
to
have
attended
to
harvey
coming
straight
from
the
child
room
all
is
now
going
on
well
at
the
grange
and
i
can
come
home
and
rest
i
wish
you
did
not
look
so
dreadfully
worn
out
said
staunton
oh
the
home
air
will
soon
pull
me
together
here
you
come
my
good
angel
and
the
tea
is
more
than
welcome
the
doctor
sank
back
in
his
deep
armchair
effie
placed
the
fragrant
tea
on
the
table
and
pouring
out
a
cup
brought
it
to
her
father
she
had
made
crisp
toast
as
well
but
he
did
not
care
to
eat
thank
you
child
he
said
i
am
not
hungry
the
meals
up
at
that
place
are
preposterous
nothing
short
of
preposterous
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
that
far
more
people
die
from
eating
too
much
than
from
eating
too
little
i
wonder
the
squire
has
a
scrap
of
digestion
left
heavy
meat
breakfasts
heavy
meat
luncheons
and
then
a
groaning
dinner
at
the
end
of
the
day
such
meals
and
practically
nothing
to
do
for
them
for
what
has
a
man
of
that
sort
to
occupy
his
time
beyond
what
one
would
call
well
this
tea
is
refreshing
i
will
go
for
a
walk
afterward
and
now
tell
me
effie
have
you
heard
anything
about
my
patients
edwards
called
this
morning
and
said
they
were
all
doing
well
said
effie
the
little
beels
have
got
but
i
do
not
think
anyone
else
is
of
course
poor
watson
is
much
as
usual
but
hers
is
a
chronic
case
ah
yes
poor
soul
the
doctor
gave
an
apprehensive
glance
toward
his
wife
i
can
not
call
to
see
watson
for
a
day
or
two
he
said
not
that
there
is
the
least
scrap
of
infection
for
i
changed
everything
before
i
came
home
but
in
her
state
it
would
not
do
to
make
her
feel
nervous
well
wife
and
daughter
it
is
good
to
see
you
both
again
and
now
i
am
going
out
for
a
stroll
the
doctor
left
the
room
effie
stood
by
the
table
she
was
putting
back
his
empty
cup
on
the
tray
and
preparing
to
take
the
things
into
the
kitchen
when
her
mother
spoke
what
is
the
matter
with
your
father
she
said
in
a
husky
voice
effie
slightly
turned
her
back
he
is
just
tired
she
answered
that
all
put
down
that
tray
effie
and
come
here
said
her
mother
effie
obeyed
yes
mother
she
said
now
mother
darling
you
are
not
going
to
get
nervous
no
no
i
am
not
nervous
said
staunton
her
lips
trembled
slightly
i
am
not
nervous
nothing
shall
make
me
show
nervousness
or
weakness

gone
through
a
great
deal
of
anxiety
has
he
not
all
his
life
been
exposed
to
infection
of
all
kinds
why
should
he
be
ill
now
besides

he
would
say

kind
of
talk

right
my

will
say

effie

one
life

which

many
others

said
staunton
i
know
what

do
not

i
rise
up
with
strength
to
meet
it
you
will
see
effie
dear
that
your
mother
is
no
coward
in
any
real
danger
you
are
a
dear
said
effie
you
are
the
best
and
most
unselfish
mother
in
the
world
i
feel
ashamed
of
myself
when
i
see
how
bravely
you
struggle
against
the
weakness
and
the
anxiety
which
must
be
yours
more
or
less
always
but
now
mother
dear
you
will
not
look
trouble
in
the
face
before

will
not
meet
it
halfway
if
you

garden

a
turn
before

us
talk
of
pleasant
things
and
be
cheerful
when
father
comes
home
oh
i
will
be
perfectly
cheerful
said
staunton
she
went
into
the
garden
at
the
back
of
the
little
cottage
and
began
with
nervous
energetic
fingers
to
pick
some
flowers
and
to
arrange
them
in
a
big
nosegay
we
will
put
these
in
the
center
of
the
she
said
i
should
like
to
have
everything
as
bright
and
cheerful
as
possible
for
your
father
yes
that
capital
said
effie
we
ought
to
have
something
particularly
good
for
him
to
eat
effie
but
mother
he
said
he
was
hungry
you
remember
how
he
complained
of
having
so
many
meals
at
the
grange
yes
yes
he
always
was
a
most
abstemious
man
but
i
know
what
he
never
can
resist
and
that
is
cold
raspberry
tart
and
cream
there
are
plenty
of
raspberries
ripe
in
the
plantation
i
will
gather
some
and
i
make
the
pastry
for
the
tart
myself
very
well
mother
but
is
it
well
for
you
to
fag
yourself
picking
those
raspberries
and
then
making
the
tart
i
want
to
make
it
i
should
love
to
make
it
i
used
to
be
famed
for
my
pastry
my
mother
used
to
say
have
a
light
hand
for
pastry
mary
i
remember
so
well
when
i
made
my
first
tart
i
was
just
fifteen
it
was
my
fifteenth
birthday
mother
showed
me
how
to
do
it
and
i
remember
how
the
water
ran
all
over
the
afterward
i
was
the
best
hand
at
pastry
in
the
house
yes
i
make
the
tart
myself
here
is
sixpence
effie
run
to
the
dairy
and
get
some
cream
and
listen
love
as
you
go
through
the
house
you
might
tell
jane
to
get
the
ready
all
right
mother
i
tell
her
to
put
it
in
the
larder
you
must
not
go
into
the
hot
kitchen
to
make
that
tart
very
well
child
i
remember
now
run
and
get
the
cream
effie
left
her
mother
standing
by
the
raspberry
plantation
she
was
pulling
the
ripe
raspberries
and
dropping
them
into
a
large
cabbage
leaf
which
she
held
her
slender
but
weak
figure
was
drawn
up
to
its
full
height
there
was
a
look
of
nervous
energy
about
her
which
effie
had
not
observed
for
many
a
long
day
the
curious
phase
into
which
her
mother
had
entered
had
an
alarming
effect
upon
the
young
girl
it
frightened
her
far
more
than
her
father
look
of
lassitude
and
the
burning
touch
of
his
hands
she
tried
to
turn
her
thoughts
from
it
after
all
why
should
she
become
nervous
herself
and
meet
trouble
halfway
she
went
across
the
village
street
and
entering
the
pretty
dairy
asked
for
the
cream
is
it
true
miss
staunton
that
the
doctor
has
come
back
again
asked
the
woman
of
the
shop
as
she
handed
her
the
jug
of
cream
across
the
counter
yes
pattens
it
is
quite
true
replied
effie
there
good
news
now
at
the
grange
harvey
is
doing
splendidly
and
little
freda
is
nearly
well
again
well
it
is
a
good
thing
the
doctor
can
be
spared
said
the
woman
we
want
him
bad
enough
here
and
it
seemed
that
he
should
have
been
sort
of
buried
alive
at
the
grange
he
is
only
able
to
be
spared
now
said
effie
because
he
has
secured
the
services
of
a
very
wonderful
nurse
oh
one
of
the
fraser
girls
said
the
woman
in
a
tone
of
contempt
those
newcomers
who
have
not
been
settled
in
the
place
above
a
year
for
my
part
i
do
hold
with
i
am
told
they
are
all
and
full
of
airs
and
that
they
need
a
sight
more
waiting
on
than
the
patients
themselves
when
you
get
a
into
the
house
you
have
to
think
more
of
the
nurse
than
of
the
patient
what
i
am
told
it
is
not
true
replied
effie
her
eyes
flashing
angrily
at
least
she
continued
it
is
not
true
in
the
case
of
nurse
fraser
you
must
get
my
father
to
talk
to
you
about
her
some
day
i
am
afraid
i
have
time
to
spare
now
mrs
pattens
effie
went
home
with
her
jug
of
cream
staunton
was
still
in
the
larder
making
the
raspberry
tart
effie
went
and
watched
her
as
her
long
thin
fingers
dabbled
in
the
flour
manipulated
the
roller
spread
out
the
butter
and
presently
produced
a
light
puff
paste
which
as
effie
expressed
it
looked
almost
as
if
you
could
blow
it
away
that
the
best
raspberry
tart
i
have
ever
made
said
staunton
now
we
will
put
it
in
the
oven
chapter
vi
the
raspberry
tart
was
put
in
the
oven
and
staunton
went
upstairs
to
her
own
room
she
was
a
woman
who
as
a
rule
utterly
disregarded
dress
she
gave
but
little
thought
to
her
personal
appearance
like
many
other
women
of
the
middle
class
she
had
sunk
since
her
marriage
from
the
trim
pretty
girl
to
the
somewhat
slatternly
matron
nothing
could
destroy
the
sweet
comeliness
of
her
face
however
but
in
the
struggle
for
life
she
and
fashion
had
fallen
out
fashion
went
in
one
direction
and
staunton
strayed
gently
in
another
she
did
not
mind
whether
her
dress
was
cut
according
to
the
mode
or
not
she
scarcely
looked
at
her
faded
but
still
pretty
face
now
and
then
this
trait
in
her
mother
character
vexed
effie
effie
adored
her
mother
she
thought
her
the
most
beautiful
of
women
and
anything
that
took
from
her
sweet
charms
annoyed
her
this
evening
however
staunton
made
a
careful
and
deliberate
toilet
she
removed
her
dowdy
black
dress
and
opening
a
drawer
in
her
wardrobe
took
out
a
soft
gray
silk
which
lay
folded
between
tissue
paper
and
sprigs
of
lavender
she
put
the
dress
on
and
fastened
soft
lace
ruffles
round
her
throat
and
at
her
wrists
the
dress
transformed
her
it
toned
with
all
her
faded
charms
she
put
a
real
lace
cap
over
her
still
thick
and
pretty
hair
and
going
down
to
the
little
parlor
sat
upright
on
one
of
the
chairs
near
the
window
which
looked
into
the
garden
effie
came
in
presently
and
started
when
she
saw
her
mother
why
mother
she
said
how
sweet
how
sweet
you
look
she
went
over
and
kissed
her
staunton
returned
her
embrace
very
quietly
it
is
for
your
father
she
said
he
would
like
me
to
look

am

bounded
into
the
room
at
this
moment

short
in
astonishment

asked
excitement
in
her
tone
no

white

once
mother
wishes

agnes
flung
herself
out
of
the
room
muttering
effie
looked
again
at
her
mother
she
did
not
notice
her
she
was
smiling
softly
to
herself
and
looking
out
at
the
garden
effie
felt
her
heart
sink
lower
and
lower
she
went
gravely
upstairs
put
on
her
blue
dress
brushed
out
her
bright
dark
hair
and
looking
her
sweetest
and
freshest
came
downstairs
again
staunton
was
still
sitting
by
the
window
her
cheeks
were
flushed
her
eyes
were
unusually
bright
she
looked
twenty
years
younger
than
she
had
done
two
hours
ago
she
looked
beautiful
the
soul
seemed
to
shine
out
of
her
face
when
effie
came
in
she
stood
up
restlessly
and
looked
at
the
supper
table
yes
she
said
it
is
just
as
he
likes
it
the
fragrant
coffee
the
raspberry
tart
and
the
jug
of
cream
the
eggs
the
brown
loaf
and
the
fresh
butter
a
simple
sort
of
meal
yes
quite
simple
and
very
wholesome
very
homelike
that
the
word
effie
there
never
was
such
a
homelike
sort
of
man
as
your
father
give
him
home
and
you
fill
his
heart
this
supper
table
is
just
what
he
will
like
best
he
does
not
care
for
things
he
is
he
is
the
best
of
men
effie
the
best
of
men
he
will
be
glad
to
see
you
in
your
nice
dress
mother
he
is
so
proud
of
you
he
thinks
you
are
so
lovely
so
i
am
in
his
eyes
said
staunton
in
a
wistful
voice
i
am
like
himself
and
this
dress
is
too
it
was
a
pretty
dress
when
it
was
made
up
let
me
see
that
was
twelve
years
ago
we
went
to
margate
for
a
week
and
he
bought
me
the
dress
he
took
great
pains
in
choosing
the
exact
shade
of
gray
he
wanted
it
to
be
silver
gray
he
said
his
mother
used
to
wear
silver
gray
when
she
sat
in
the
porch
on
summer
evenings
yes
this
dress
is
like
a
piece
of
old
lavender
it
reminds
me
of
the
past
of
the
sunny
happy
past
i
have
had
such
a
happy
life
effie
never
a
cross
word
said
never
a
dour
look
given
me
love
has
surrounded
me
from
the
moment
of
my
marriage
until
now
i
feel
young
and
i
am
going
to
be
happy
very
happy
the
children
must
look
their
best
too
run
up
darling
to
the
nursery
and
see
that
susan
is
doing
them
justice
they
are
pretty
children
every
one
of
them
worthy
of
your
father
now
let
me
see
would
not
a
few
roses
improve
this
table
that
great
jug
of
sweet
peas
in
the
middle
is
just
what
he
likes
but
we
might
have
roses
and
mignonette
as
well
go
and
gather
a
bunch
of
those
banksia
roses
which
grow
in
front
of
the
house
you
tire
yourself
mother
let
me
go
no
i
never
felt
stronger
than
i
do
i
like
to
pick
them
myself
staunton
went
out
of
doors
she
cut
great
sprays
from
the
banksia
rose
and
brought
them
back
with
her
she
placed
them
in
a
brown
jug
and
stood
the
jug
on
the
table
then
she
opened
both
windows
wide
and
left
the
door
ajar
there
was
the
sweetest
smell
wafted
through
the
room
the
sweet
peas
roses
mignonette
seemed
to
be
floating
in
the
air
the
children
all
came
down
dressed
in
their
sunday
frocks
they
looked
puzzled
uncomfortable
awed
one
and
all
asked
the
same
question
is
it
a
party
mother
are
any
visitors
coming
to
tea
no
no
replied
the
mother
to
each
in
his
or
her
turn
it
is
only
your
father
who
has
come
home
and
it
is
right
that
we
should
give
him
a
welcome
when
she
had
answered
the
last
of
the
children
staunton
entered
the
room
he
started
at
the
pretty
sight
which
met
his
eyes
the
room
and
the
temptingly
laid
out
supper
table
the
children
in
their
best
dresses
the
old
wife
in
her
gray
silk
looked
to
him
the
most
beautiful
sight
his
eyes
had
ever
rested
on
what
was
all
this
festival
about
he
drew
himself
up
hastily
a
sort
of
shudder
went
through
him
in
spite
of
his
efforts
his
voice
was
terribly
husky
are
we
going
to
have
company
he
asked
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
all
the
other
eyes
looked
back
at
him
he
knew
perfectly
well
even
before
the
children
burst
out
with
the
news
that
he
himself
was
the
company
you
have
come
back
father
and
mother
says
we
are
to
look
our
very
best
exclaimed
little
phil
all
right
phil
i
am
more
than
agreeable
replied
the
doctor
now
you
must
excuse
me
good
folk
i
am
bound
in
duty
to
do
honor
to
all
this
company
splendor
by
washing
my
hands
and
putting
on
my
coat
effie
you
may
fetch
the
coffee
said
her
mother
the
supper
that
followed
was
a
merry
meal
staunton
told
his
best
stories
they
were
capped
by
his
wife
effie
laughed
as
if
she
had
never
heard
them
before
and
the
children
made
themselves
riotously
agreeable
when
the
meal
was
at
an
end
staunton
and
his
wife
went
out
into
the
garden
at
the
back
of
the
house
he
drew
his
arm
round
her
waist
and
they
walked
up
and
down
together
on
the
little
rose
path
at
the
top
of
the
garden
effie
watched
them
from
the
parlor
window
there
was
a
queer
lump
in
her
throat
she
could
not
get
over
the
strange
sensation
of
nervousness
and
coming
disaster
the
foreboding
which
filled
her
could
not
be
fought
down
she
had
laughed
almost
against
her
will
at
but
now
she
ceased
to
smile
she
no
longer
made
the
faintest
attempt
to
be
cheerful
she
hated
the
pretty
room
and
the
and
the
roses
and
mignonette
the
children
were
idly
lolling
about
she
turned
and
spoke
almost
crossly
do
you
know
aggie
that
it
is
long
past
the
younger
children
hour
for
staying
up
ca
you
make
yourself
useful
for
once
and
go
up
and
put
them
to
bed
ca
you
come
effie
we
much
rather
have
you
said
little
phil
and
walter
the
brother
next
in
age
agnes

so
cross
she
pulls
our
hair
so
when
she
combs
it
out
i
do
you
bad
boys
exclaimed
agnes
coloring
high
wo
i
give
it
to
you
next
time
we
are
alone
for
saying
that
she
does
effie
she
does
indeed
said
little
phil
running
up
to
his
elder
sister
and
clasping
his
arms
round
her
light
blue
dress
do
phil
you
will
spoil
my
pretty
frock
she
cried
why
you
are
cross
too
he
answered
looking
up
at
her
he
was
so
startled
and
amazed
at
this
new
tone
in
effie
voice
that
words
failed
him
altogether
for
a
minute
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
a
castle
of
cards
had
tumbled
all
over
his
head
and
as
if
he
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
ruins
if
effie
were
going
to
turn
nasty
according
to
phil
idea
there
was
nothing
further
to
be
looked
for
in
life
walter
however
who
was
older
had
more
discernment
than
his
little
brother
effie
has
a
headache
he
said
ca
you
see
that
she
has
a
headache
we
be
very
good
indeed
effie
if
agnes
will
put
us
to
bed
come
along
then
said
agnes
scuttling
them
out
of
the
room
in
front
of
her
you
must
be
quick
about
it
for
i
have
not
half
prepared
my
lessons
now
then
out
you
go
the
children
disappeared
the
room
was
once
more
empty
except
for
the
silent
figure
who
stood
in
the
window
she
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
father
and
mother
walking
up
and
down
in
the
garden
presently
the
two
approached
the
house
staunton
went
straight
upstairs
to
her
room
and
the
doctor
returned
to
the
parlor
your
mother
is
very
tired
effie
he
said
in
a
grave
voice
he
sat
down
in
the
armchair
just
where
he
could
smell
the
and
the
banksia
roses
yes
he
continued
i
am
anxious
about
her
there
was
not
a
trace
now
of
any
of
the
jollity
which
had
marked
him
at
supper
his
face
was
gray
and
worn
his
voice
decidedly
husky
that
huskiness
in
her
voice
went
like
a
stab
to
effie
heart
she
shut
the
door
and
went
and
stood
by
his
side
do
you
think
you
had
better
go
upstairs
and
help
your
mother
to
get
to
bed
no
she
likes
best
to
be
alone
replied
effie
i
want
to
sit
by
you
what
is
the
matter
with
your
throat
my
throat
why
you
are
so
husky
i
am
dead
beat
that
the
truth
of
it
i
am
as
weak
as
a
cat
and
for
no
earthly
reason
do
bother
about
my
throat
it
will
be
all
right
after
i
have
had
a
good
night
rest
i
tell
you
effie
i
never
saw
a
child
so
ill
as
that
little
freda
harvey
that
woman
who
nursed
her
is
an
angel
an
angel
i
did
say
too
much
about
her
father
did
i
said
effie
with
a
little
note
of
triumph
coming
into
her
voice
even
in
the
midst
of
her
anxiety
that
you
did
my
darling
she
is
one
of
god
angels
and
i
say
bless
her
now
i
want
to
talk
about
your
mother
yes
father
said
effie
laying
her
hand
on
his
she
started
back
the
moment
she
did
so
the
evening
was
a
very
hot
one
and
touching
the
doctor
hand
was
like
clasping
fire
how
you
burn
she
exclaimed
that
weakness
he
said
i
shall
take
some
bromide
i
am
completely
shaken
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
now
effie
do
interrupt
me
i
wish
to
talk
to
you
of
your
mother
are
you
prepared
to
listen
of
course
father
she
has
been
talking
of
you
she
says
you
have
got
an
idea
into
your
head
that
you
ought
to
make
more
of
your
life
than
you
can
make
of
it
staying
at
home
and
being
the
blessing
of
the
house
and
the
joy
of
my
life
and
of
hers
oh
father
father
i
did
wish
it
said
effie
tears
springing
into
her
eyes
i
did
long
for
it
but
i
give
it
up
i
give
it
all
up
if
it
makes
you
and
mother
unhappy
but
it
does
my
dear
the
old
birds
can
not
expect
to
keep
the
young
ones
in
the
nest
for
ever
and
ever
your
mother
spoke
very
sensibly
i
never
saw
any
woman
so
altered
for
the
time
being
she
would
not
let
me
imagine
there
was
a
thing
the
matter
with
her
and
she
spoke
all
the
time
about
you
as
though
she
wanted
to
plead
with
me
your
father
to
give
you
a
happy
life
do
you
think
i
would
deny
it
to
you
my
dear
little
girl
no
father
you
have
never
denied
me
anything
i
have
never
denied
what
was
for
your
good
sweetheart
staunton
clasped
effie
to
his
breast
she
flung
her
arms
round
him
with
a
sudden
tight
pressure
easy
easy
he
exclaimed
you
are
me
my
breathing
certainly
feels
oppressed
i
must
have
taken
a
chill
i
get
off
to
bed
as
fast
as
i
can
no
child
you
need
not
be
alarmed
i
have
often
noticed
this
queer
development
of
hoarseness
in
people
who
have
long
breathed
the
poisonous
air
which
surrounds
diphtheria
and
scarlet
fever
but
in
my
case
the
hoarseness
means
nothing
now
effie
let
me
say
a
word
or
two
to
you
i
do
know
what
the
future
has
in
it
it
is
impossible
for
any
of
us
to
know
the
future
and
i
say
thank
god
for
the
blessed
curtain
which
hides
it
from
our
view
but
whatever
it
has
in
it
my
child
i
wish
you
to
understand
that
you
are
to
do
your
best
with
your
life
make
it
full
if
you
can
in
any
case
make
it
blessed
a
month
ago
i
will
admit
frankly
i
did
not
approve
of
after
my
wonderful
experience
however
with
dorothy
fraser
i
must
say
that
i
have
completely
changed
my
opinion
the
girl
with
heart
and
nerve
with
common
sense
with
an
unselfish
spirit
can
be
a
nurse
whatever
her
station
in
life
if
to
these
qualifications
she
adds
the
refinements
of
good
breeding
and
the
education
of
a
lady
she
is
the
best
of
all
hurrah
cried
effie
tears
filled
her
eyes
what
a
grand
triumph
for
dorothy
she
exclaimed
she
deserves
every
word
i
have
said
of
her
if
she
wishes
to
take
you
back
with
her
to
london
when
she
goes
if
that
is
what
is
now
at
the
bottom
of
your
heart
go
child
with
my
blessing
we
shall
miss
you
at
home
of
course
but
we
are
not
worth
our
salt
if
we
are
going
to
be
selfish
you
never
never
were
that
said
effie
now
i
have
one
more
thing
to
say
it
is
about
your
mother
i
have
never
really
told
you
my
true
fears
about
her
you
know
of
course
that
she
suffers
from
weakness
of
the
heart
at
present
that
weakness
springs
from
no
organic
source
but
of
late
there
have
been
symptoms
which
make
me
fear
that
the
functional
mischief
may
be
developed
into
the
more
serious
organic
form
of
disease
should
any
shock
be
given
her
it
is
that
fear
which
haunts
my
life
i
could
not
live
without
your
mother
child
effie
child
i
could
not
live
without
her
the
doctor
voice
suddenly
broke
he
bowed
his
head
on
his
hands
and
a
broken
sort
of
groan
escaped
his
lips
we
take
all
possible
care
of
her
said
effie
she
shall
not
have
any
pain
nor
fear
nor
anxiety
i
know
you
will
do
your
best
said
the
doctor
but
if
you
leave
her
i
never
leave
her
if
it
is
to
injure
her
there
i
have
promised
you
are
a
good
girl
i
trust
you
i
lean
on
you
your
mother
could
not
live
through
an
anxiety
a
great
fear
a
great
trouble
would
kill
her
it
sha
come
said
effie
god
grant
it
may
not
come
said
the
doctor
in
his
husky
voice
he
rose
suddenly
to
his
feet
i
must
go
to
bed
he
said
i
have
not
had
a
real
proper
sleep
for
nights
and
nights
by
the
way
effie
you
know
of
course
that
my
life
is
insured
for
a
thousand
pounds
if
if
at
any
time
that
should
be
needed
it
will
be
there
it
is
best
for
you
to
know
i
wish
you
would
not
talk
about
it
father
very
well
i
wo
but
talking
about
things
does
bring
trouble
any
nearer
i
hold
it
as
an
article
of
faith
that
each
man
should
arrange
all
he
can
for
the
future
of
his
family
arranging
for
the
future
never
hastens
matters
there
is
a
god
above
he
has
led
me
all
my
days
i
trust
him
absolutely
i
submit
to
his
mighty
will
the
doctor
left
the
room
his
broad
back
was
bowed
he
walked
slowly
effie
stood
near
the
door
of
the
little
parlor
watching
him
until
his
gray
head
was
lost
to
view
then
she
went
back
and
sat
on
the
old
sofa
with
her
hands
clasped
tightly
before
her
my
father
is
the
best
man
in
the
world
she
murmured
under
her
breath
i
never
met
anyone
like
my
father
so
simple
so
straightforward
so
full
of
real
feeling
so
broad
in
his
views
talk
of
a
sequestered
life
making
a
man
narrower
there
never
was
a
man
more
open
to
real
conviction
than
father
the
fact
is
no
girl
ever
had
better
parents
than
i
have
and
the
wonderful
thing
is
that
they
give
me
leave
to
go
and
take
their
blessing
with
me
it
is
wonderful
it
is
splendid
agnes
must
be
taught
to
do
my
present
work
i
train
her
for
the
next
three
months
and
then
perhaps
in
the
winter
i
can
join
dorothy
in
london
dear
father
he
is
nervous
about
mother
but
while
he
is
there
no
harm
can
come
to
her
i
do
not
believe
one
could
live
without
the
other
well
well
i
feel
excited
and
nervous
myself
i
had
better
follow
father
example
and
go
to
bed
chapter
vii
effie
little
room
faced
the
east
she
never
drew
down
her
blind
at
night
and
the
sun
was
shining
all
over
her
face
when
her
mother
came
in
the
next
morning
to
call
her
staunton
standing
in
her
nightdress
in
the
middle
of
the
room
called
effie
in
a
shrill
voice

the
world

the
matter

her
daughter
sitting
up
and
pushing
back
her
hair
from
her
eyes

trembled
all
over
as
she
spoke

a
purple
spot
on
one
cheek
the
other
was
deadly
pale
a
blue
tint
surrounded
her
lips

am

labored
way

she
tumbled

her
pretty
cheeks
were
flushed
with
sleep
her
eyes
bright
and
shining
turned
toward
the
eastern
light
for
a
moment
oh
mother
she
said
with
a
sudden
burst
of
feeling
do

us
keep
up
our
courage
nothing
will
save
him
if
we
lose
our
courage

fraser

as
she
will
she
will

it
he
has
been
murmuring
in
his
sleep
about
her
about
something
she
did
for
little
freda
clasping
his
throat
all
the
time
and
suffocating
one
glance
showed
me
what
ailed
him
when
i
awoke
this
morning
he
has
a
hard
fight
before
him
but
he
must
not
die

her
eyes

got
quickly
into
her
clothes
now
i
will
go
she
said
i
will
bring
dorothy
back
with
me
if
there
is
any
difficulty
said
staunton
if
she
hesitates
for
a
moment
you
must
remember
there

only
one
thing
to
be
done
yes

harvey
instead
of
her
do
you
understand
and
i
am
not
to
come
back
to
father
when
he
is
ill
said
effie
aghast
that
is
not
the
point
exclaimed
staunton
the
only
thing
to
be
considered
is
what
will
save
him
and
you
and
i
and
our
feelings
are
of
no
consequence
his
life
is
so
valuable
that

too
great
to
keep
it
go
child
go
if
you
can
come
back
come
if

worry
about
the
children
get
dorothy
as
quickly
as
possible
effie
buttoned
her
dress
and
pinned
on
her
hat
and
then
went
out
on
the
landing
where
are
you
going
child
why
do
you
go
downstairs
i
must
kiss
father
first
what
folly
why
should
there
be
this
delay
i
wo
be
a
minute
effie
turned
the
handle
of
the
bedroom
door
and
went
softly
into
the
room
her
father
was
lying
on
his
back
there
was
a
livid
look
about
his
face
great
beads
of
perspiration
stood
on
his
brow
his
eyes
were
closed
he
did
not
see
effie
when
she
came
into
the
room
but
when
she
bent
down
and
kissed
his
forehead
he
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
at
her
he
said
something
which
she
could
not
distinguish
he
was
too
hoarse
to
make
any
words
articulate
i
am
going
for
dorothy
she
said
with
a
smile
she
soon
make
you
better
god
bless
you
father
i
love
you
father
i
love
you
his
eyes
smiled
at
her
but
his
lips
could
not
speak
she
went
quickly
out
of
the
room
chapter
viii
it
did
not
take
effie
long
to
harness
the
old
horse
to
the
gig
she
had
often
driven
old
jock
and
this
part
of
her
task
did
not
put
her
out
in
the
least
she
had
a
curious
sense
as
she
was
driving
toward
the
grange
in
the
fresh
early
morning
air
of
the
complete
change
which
was
awaiting
her
she
was
quite
certain
that
one
door
in
her
life
was
shut
shut
forever
she
had
longed
for
change
it
had
come
at
last
with
a
vengeance
it
was
horrible
it
made
her
shudder
effie
was
a
thoroughly
healthy
girl
healthy
both
in
mind
and
body
but
now
a
sick
pain
was
over
her
she
did
not
care
to
think
of
the
real
terror
which
haunted
her
she
arrived
at
the
grange
between
six
and
seven
the
woman
at
the
lodge
ran
out
and
opened
the
gate
for
the
doctor
gig
in
some
surprise
she
thought
something
was
wrong
again
up
at
the
house
but
her
surprise
strengthened
to
astonishment
when
she
saw
that
effie
was
driving
the
horse
why

effie
what
is
the
matter
she
exclaimed
everyone
in
the
place

said
the
woman
falling
back
a
step
or
two
in
horror
effie
nodded
her
head
she
had
no
words
to
speak
she
whipped
up
jock
and
drove
quickly
down
the
avenue
a
was
on
her
knees
whitening
and
polishing
the
front
steps
effie
jumped
from
the
gig
and
asked
the
girl
to

someone
to

horse

any

the
men

and
into
the
house
she
had
never
been
at
the
grange
before
but
she
had
no
eyes
for
the
beauties
of
the
old
place
this
morning
there
was
something
too
awful
lying
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
for
any
external
things
to
affect
her
she
went
quickly
up
the
broad
front
stairs
and
paused
on
the
first
landing
how
was
she
to
discover
the
room
where
dorothy
and
little
freda
harvey
spent
their
time
together
she
was
about
to
turn
back
in
utter
bewilderment
when
to
her
relief
she
saw
another
servant
the
servant
stopped
and
stared
at
effie
effie
came
up
to
her
quickly

be
surprised
to

said

said
the
girl
she
turned
down
a
corridor

the
servant
walked
rather
slowly
and
in
a
dubious
sort
of
way
ca
you
hurry
said
effie
it
is
a
matter
of
life
and
death
the
girl
hastened
her
steps
a
little
effie
manner
frightened
her
presently
they
reached
a
baize
door
the
servant
pushed
it
open
but
stood
aside
herself
it
is
as
much
as
my
place
is
worth
to
open
this
door
she
said
it
is
here
the
infectious
case
is
and
miss
fraser

orders
are
that
the
door
is

the
servant
banged
to
the
baize
door
and
effie
found
herself
alone
she
ran
down
the
passage
and
opened
the
outer
nursery
door
it
was
quiet
and
still
in
perfect
order
the
blinds
down
and
the
windows
open
effie
in
spite
of
all
her
agitation
walked
on
tiptoe
across
this
room
a
door
which
led
into
another

half
open

chapter
ix
from
the
first
it
was
a
bad
case
the
throat
was
not
so
particularly
affected
but
the
weakness
was
extreme
all
imaginable
devices
were
resorted
to
to
keep
up
the
patient
strength
notwithstanding
all
human
precautions
however
that
strength
failed
and
failed
in
a
few
days
the
strong
man
was
like
an
infant
he
could
not
lift
a
finger
he
could
scarcely
turn
his
head
his
voice
was
completely
gone
his
stricken
soul
could
only
look
dumbly
into
the
world
through
his
eyes
those
honest
eyes
were
pathetic
dorothy
was
unremitting
in
her
attentions
she
took
complete
charge
from
the
very
first
edwards
came
and
went
but
he
gave
the
nursing
to
dorothy
she
had
prepared
herself
for
a
great
fight
she
had
hoped
to
conquer
but
on
the
third
day
of
the
doctor
illness
she
knew
that
the
battle
was
not
to
the
strong
nor
the
race
to
the
swift
in
short
the
good
doctor
was
called
to
render
up
his
account
his
short
span
of
mortal
life
was
over
one
evening
he
had
lain
perfectly
still
and
in
a
state
of
apparent
stupor
for
several
hours
dorothy
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
patient
it
is
strange
how
much
i
admire
him
she
said
to
herself
i
never
met
a
nobler
man
dorothy
come
here
said
the
doctor
she
went
at
once
and
bent
over
him
i
am
going
he
said
looking
at
her
yes
staunton
she
answered
he
closed
his
eyes
again
for
a
moment
the
wife
he
murmured
does
she
know
i
am
not
sure
said
dorothy
in
her
quiet
clear
voice
which
never
for
a
moment
sank
to
a
whisper
i
think
she
must
guess
i
have
not
told
her
she
had
better
know
said
the
doctor
will
you
bring
her
here
yes
i
go
and
fetch
her
at
once
dorothy
left
the
room
she
stood
for
a
moment
on
the
landing
the
task
which
lay
immediately
before
her
made
her
spirits
sink
she
knew
just
as
well
as
staunton
did
how
precarious
was
tenure
of
life
she
knew
that
a
sudden
shock
might
be
fatal
were
those
children
to
lose
both
parents
the
doctor
was
going
no
mortal
aid
now
could
avail
for
him
but
must
the
mother
also
leave
the
children
i
do
not
know
what
to
do
thought
dorothy
she
must
see
her
husband
they
meet
he
is
the
bravest
man
i
know
but
can
he
suppress
his
own
feelings
now
now
that
he
is
dying
no
no
it
is
too
much
to
ask
but
i
greatly
greatly
fear
that
if
he
does
not
the
shock
will
kill
her
dorothy
went
slowly
downstairs
she
was
generally
decisive
in
her
actions
now
she
trembled
and
a
terrible
nervousness
seized
her
when
she
reached
the
little
entrance
hall
and
was
about
to
open
the
door
of
the
parlor
where
she
expected
to
find
staunton
she
was
surprised
to
come
face
to
face
with
a
tall
bronzed
young
man
who
was
taking
off
his
hat
and
hanging
it
on
one
of
the
pegs
in
the
he
turned
and
started
when
he
saw
her
he
was
evidently
unfamiliar
with
nurses
and
sickness
his
face
flushed
up
and
he
said
in
a
sort
of
apologetic
way
surely
this
is
staunton
house
yes
said
dorothy
i
am
george
staunton
i
i
came
down
on
pressing
business
i
want
to
see
my
father
in
a
hurry
what
is
the
matter
he
stepped
back
a
pace
or
two
startled
by
the
expression
on
face
come
in
here
at
once
she
said
seizing
his
hand
she
dragged
him
into
the
the
moment
they
got
inside
she
deliberately
locked
the
door
you
have
come
just
in
time
she
said
you
must
bear
up
i
hope
be
brave
can
you
bear
a
great
shock
without
without
fainting
or
anything
of
that
sort
oh
i
wo
faint
he
answered
his
lips
trembled
his
blue
eyes
grew
wide
open
the
pupils
began
to
dilate
i
believe
you
are
a
brave
lad
said
dorothy
noticing
these
signs
it
is
your
lot
now
to
come
face
to
face
with
great
trouble
staunton
your
father
is
dying
good
god
merciful
god
said
the
lad
he
sank
down
on
the
nearest
chair
he
was
white
to
the
lips
dorothy
went
up
and
took
his
hand
there
there
she
said
you
be
better
in
a
moment
try
to
forget
yourself
we
have
not
any
of
us
a
single
instant
just
now
to
think
of
ourselves
i
have
come
down
to
fetch
your
mother
you
are
the
nurse
said
george
glancing
at
her
dress
yes
i
am
nursing
your
father

has
been
a
very
bad
case
diphtheria
a
very
acute
and
hopeless
case

your
mother
my
mother

i
mean
she

not
worse
than

but
her
life
is
bound
up
in
your
father
it
would
be
a
dreadful
thing
for
your
sisters
and
yourself
if
your
mother
were
to
die
your
coming
here
at
this
moment
may
mean
her
salvation

a
minute

brave

me
into
the
room
as
soon
as
you
can
dorothy
left
the
drawing
room
as
she
went
away
she
heard
the
young
man
groan
she
did
not
give
herself
time
to
think
she
opened
the
parlor
door
staunton
was
sitting
in
her
favorite
seat
by
the
window
her
face
was
scarcely
at
all
paler
than
it
had
been
a
week
ago
she
sat
then
by
the
window
looking
out
at
her
trouble
which
showed
like
a
speck
in
the
blue
sky
the
shadow
which
enveloped
her
whole
life
was
coming
closer
now
enveloping
her
like
a
thick
fog
still
she
was
bearing
up
her
eyes
were
gazing
out
on
the
garden
on
the
flowers
which
she
and
the
doctor
had
tended
and
loved
together
some
of
the
younger
children
had
clustered
round
her
knee
one
of
them
held
her
hand
another
played
with
a
bunch
of
keys
and
trinkets
which
she
always
wore
at
her
side
go
on
mother
said
little
marjory
aged
seven
do
stop
i
have
nearly
finished
said
staunton
but
not
quite
go
on
mother
i
want
to
hear
the
end
of
the
story
said
phil
staunton
did
not
see
dorothy
who
stood
motionless
near
the
door
they
got
so
tired
she
began
in
a
monotonous
sort
of
voice
so
dreadfully
tired
that
there
was
nothing
for
them
to
do
but
to
try
and
get
into
the
white
garden
a
repeated
phil
was
it
pretty
lovely
why
was
it
called
a
white
garden
asked
marjory
because
of
the
flowers
they
were
all
white
white
roses
white
lilies
snowdrops
chrysanthemums
all
the
flowers
that
are
pure
white
without
any
color
the
air
is
sweet
with
their
perfume
the
people
who
come
to
live
in
the
white
garden
wear
white
flowers
on
their
white
dresses
it
is
a
beautiful
sight
it
must
be
said
marjory
who
had
a
great
deal
of
imagination
are
the
people
happy
perfectly
happy
rested
you
know
marjory
they
are
peaceful
as
you
are
when
you
are
tucked
up
in
your
little
bed
i
like
best
to
play
and
romp
said
marjory
in
a
meditative
voice
but
then
you
see
i
am
never
tired
dorothy
is
standing
at
the
door
exclaimed
phil
come
in
dorothy
and
listen
to
mother
beautiful
story
do
you
want
me
asked
staunton
standing
up
she
began
to
tremble
the
children
looked
at
her
anxiously
dorothy
went
straight
up
and
took
her
hand
staunton
wishes
to
see
you
she
said
will
you
come
with
me
she
looked
anxiously
toward
the
door
staunton
put
up
her
hand
to
her
head
my
darlings
she
said
looking
at
the
little
pair
who
were
gazing
up
at
her
with
puzzled
faces
go
and
play
in
the
garden
and
do
forget
the
white
garden
about
which
we
have
been
speaking
she
stooped
down
and
deliberately
kissed
both
children
then
she
held
out
her
hand
to
dorothy
i
am
quite
ready
she
said
at
that
moment
george
entered
the
room
he
put
his
arms
round
his
mother
he
was
a
big
fellow
his
arms
were
strong
the
muscles
in
his
neck
seemed
to
start
out
his
eyes
looked
straight
into
his
mother
you
have
got
mother
i
am
george
he
said
come
let
us
go
to
my
father
together
staunton
tottered
upstairs
she
was
not
in
the
least
surprised
at
seeing
george
but
she
leaned
very
firmly
on
him
they
went
into
the
sickroom
and
when
george
knelt
down
by
his
father
bedside
staunton
knelt
by
him
the
doctor
was
going
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
valley
from
which
there
is
no
return
earthly
sounds
were
growing
dim
to
his
ears
earthly
voices
were
losing
their
meaning
earthly
sights
were
fading
before
his
failing
eyes
the
dew
of
death
was
on
his
forehead
staunton
whose
face
was
nearly
as
white
bent
down
lower
and
lower
until
her
lips
touched
his
hand
the
touch
of
her
lips
made
him
open
his
eyes
he
saw
his
wife
the
look
on
her
face
seemed
to
bring
him
back
to
earth
again
it
was
like
a
sort
of
return
wave
landing
him
high
on
the
shores
of
time
his
impulse
was
to
say
come
with
me
let
us
enter
into
the
rest
of
the
lord
together
but
then
he
saw
george
george
had
thrown
his
arm
round
his
mother
waist
let
me
keep
her
father
said
the
young
man
do
take
her
yet
let
me
keep
her
yes
stay
with
the
lad
mary
said
the
doctor
it
was
a
final
act
of
his
eyelids
drooped
over
his
dying
eyes
he
never
spoke
again
chapter
george
stayed
at
whittington
for
a
week
he
followed
his
father
to
the
grave
staunton
clung
to
him
with
a
sort
of
feverish
tenacity
whenever
he
came
into
the
room
her
eyes
followed
him
a
sort
of
wistful
contented
expression
came
into
them
when
he
sat
down
beside
her
during
all
the
time
george
was
in
the
house
she
never
broke
down
at
last
however
the
time
came
when
he
must
leave
her
i
must
go
back
to
my
work
he
said
but
you
are
coming
to
london
soon
then
i
be
with
you
every
evening
you
know
my
father
has
given
you
to
me
to
take
care
of
it
will
be
all
right
when
we
are
in
london
together
yes
my
boy
she
replied
it
will
be
all
right
then
i
complain
she
added
i
do
attempt
to
murmur
i
shall
go
to
him
but
he
can
not
return
to
me
and
i
have
got
you
george
and
he
gave
me
to
you
i
am
willing
to
stay
with
you
just
as
long
as
you
want
me
it
was
late
that
night
when
george
left
his
mother
room
effie
was
standing
in
the
passage
the
brother
and
sister
looked
at
each
other
effie
had
come
home
the
day
after
staunton
death
come
out
with
me
for
a
bit
effie
said
her
brother
they
went
into
the
garden
and
she
linked
her
hand
through
his
arm
dorothy
fraser
had
now
returned
to
her
duties
in
london
the
stauntons
were
to
go
up
to
town
as
soon
as
ever
the
cottage
could
be
sold
it
had
belonged
to
the
doctor
george
was
to
live
with
them
when
they
were
in
town
and
perhaps
effie
would
be
able
to
follow
the
great
wish
of
her
mind
there
was
just
a
possibility
that
she
might
be
able
to
be
trained
as
a
hospital
nurse
she
looked
up
at
george
now
you
have
been
such
a
comfort
to
us
she
said
dorothy
told
me
everything
and
i
know
that
if
you
had
not
come
just
at
the
opportune
moment
we
should
have
lost
our
mother
as
well
as
our
father
i
do
all
in
my
power
to
hurry
matters
so
that
we
can
come
to
london
before
the
winter
yes
said
george
he
was
a
finely
built
young
fellow
with
a
handsome
face
he
was
not
the
least
like
effie
who
was
dark
and
rather
small
like
her
mother
george
had
the
doctor
physique
he
had
great
square
shoulders
his
eyes
were
frank
and
blue
like
his
father
but
his
mouth
wanted
his
father
firmness
effie
he
said
i
do
know
how
i
am
to
bring
myself
to
confide
in
you
confide
in
me
she
said
with
a
little
start
we
always
did
tell
our
secrets
to
one
another
but
all
this
terrible
trouble
seems
to
have
put
childish
things
away
have
you
really
a
secret
george
to
tell
me
i
do
know
how
i
can
tell
it
to
you
he
replied
his
lips
quivered
he
looked
down
effie
clasped
his
arm
affectionately
you
know
i
would
do
anything
for
you
she
said
yes
i
know
you
are
the
best
of
girls
and
you
awfully
pretty
too
i
know
fred
lawson
will
think
so
when
he
sees
you
who
is
he
a
friend
of
mine
a
right
good
fellow
he
is
a
medical
student
at
joseph
hospital
i
have
often
met
him
and
he
has
talked
to
me
about
his
own
sisters
and
one
day
i
showed
him
your
photograph
and
he
said
what
a
pretty
girl
you
were
somehow
effie
i
never
thought
of
you
as
pretty
until
fred
said
so
i
suppose
fellows
do
think
how
their
sisters
look
although
they
love
them
very
dearly
but
when
fred
said
it
it
opened
my
eyes
dear
dear
why
am
i
talking
like
this
when
time
is
so
precious
and
i
effie
when
i
came
down
that
day
to
see
my
father
i
was
in
trouble
great
trouble
the
shock
of
seeing
him
seemed
to
banish
it
from
my
mind
but
it
can
not
be
banished
it
can
not
be
banished
effie
and
i
have
no
one
to
confide
in
now
but
you
you
must
tell
me
of
course
said
effie
she
felt
herself
turning
pale
she
could
not
imagine
what
george
trouble
was
the
night
was
dusk
she
raised
her
eyes
to
her
brother
face
he
avoided
meeting
them
he
had
a
stick
in
his
hand
and
he
began
to
poke
holes
in
the
gravel
how
much
money
have
we
got
to
live
on
he
asked
abruptly
how
much
money
have
we
to
live
on
repeated
effie
i
believe
when
all
is
collected
that
there
will
be
something
like
a
hundred
a
year
for
mother
and
agnes
and
katie
and
the
two
little
children
of
course
i
am
going
to
support
myself
and
you
are
naturally
off
our
hands
it
awful
said
george
it
awful
to
be
so
starvingly
poor
as
that
why
i
get
a
hundred
a
year
now
fancy
five
people
living
on
a
sum
on
which
i
never
can
make
both
ends
meet
what
is
the
matter
with
you
george
how
queerly
you
speak
you
knew
we
should
be
awfully
poor
when
father
died
you
are
going
to
pay
for
your
board
are
you
not
when
you
come
to
us
and
that
will
be
a
great
help
yes
of
course
i
vow
and
declare
that
i
give
mother
at
least
half
of
what
i
earn
well
that
will
be
fifty
pounds
a
great
help
my
idea
for
myself
is
but
effie
stopped
abruptly
she
saw
that
george
was
making
an
impatient
movement
i
tell
you
another
time
she
said
in
a
gentle
voice
you
have
something
now
to
tell
me
have
you
not
i
have
god
knows
i
have
i
want
to
get
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
somewhere
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
exclaimed
effie
george
might
just
as
well
have
asked
her
for
the
moon
i
do
understand
she
said
after
a
pause
no
and
i
never
want
you
to
effie
replied
the
young
man
i
tell
you
what
i
want
the
money
for
but
it
a
matter
of
life
and
death
i
thought
i
had
made
up
my
mind
a
husky
sound
came
into
his
throat
i
made
up
my
mind
to
tell
everything
to
my
father
when
i
came
down
that
night
i
could
have
told
him
it
was
not
a
sort
of
thing
to
talk
to
you
about
but
i
thought
i
could
tell
him
he
died
and
he
gave
me
mother
he
left
mother
with
me
you
know
perfectly
well
effie
that
our
mother
life
hangs
on
a
thread
you
know
she
must
not
have
a
shock
and
yet
effie
effie
if
i
do
get
that
she
will
have
such
a
shock
such
a
terrible
shock
that
it
will
send
her
to
her
grave
i
must
think
said
effie
i
can
not
answer
you
in
a
moment
is
there
no
earthly
way
you
can
help
me
i
must
be
helped
said
george
in
a
frantic
voice
i
have
got
six
weeks
longer
i
must
get
that
in
six
weeks
or
no
i
ca
tell
you
yes
you
must
try
i
wo
help
you
unless
you
try
well
then
here
goes
if
i
do
get
it
i
shall
have
to
go
to
george
voice
sank
to
a
hoarse
whisper
effie
could
not
suppress
a
cry
chapter
xi
then
you
have
done
something
wrong
said
effie
loosening
her
hold
of
her
brother
arm
and
backing
to
a
little
distance
he
could
scarcely
see
her
face
in
the
ever
increasing
darkness
but
he
noticed
the
change
in
her
voice
there
was
an
indignant
note
of
pained
and
astonished
youth
in
it
effie
had
never
come
face
to
face
with
the
graver
sins
of
life
the
word
prison
stunned
her
she
forgot
pity
for
a
moment
in
indignation
george
she
said
with
a
sort
of
gasp
father
left
mother
to
you
in
a
sort
of
way
he
gave
her
up
to
you
and
you
have
done
wrong
you
have
sinned
you
talk
just
like
a
girl
said
george
you
jump
at
conclusions
you
an
innocent
girl
living
in
the
shelter
of
home
know
as
little
about
the
temptations
which
we
young
fellows
have
to
meet
out
in
the
world
as
you
know
of
the
heavens
above
you
my
god
effie
it
is
a
hard
world
it
is
hard
to
keep
straight
in
it
yes
i
have
done
wrong
i
know
it
and
father
gave
mother
to
me
if
you
turn
away
from
me
effie
i
shall
go
to
the
bad
i
shall
go
to
the
worst
of
all
there
will
not
be
a
chance
for
me
if
you
turn
from
me
the
tone
of
despair
in
his
voice
changed
effie
frame
of
mind
in
a
moment
she
ran
up
to
him
and
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
i
wo
turn
from
you
poor
george
she
said
it
did
shock
me
for
a
moment
it
frightened
me
rather
more
than
i
can
express
but
perhaps
i
did
not
hear
you
aright
perhaps
you
did
not
say
the
word
you
do
mean
to
say
that
unless
you
get
that
impossible
sum
of
money
you
will
have
to
go
to
prison
george
before
god
it
is
true
said
george
i
can
not
i
wo
tell
you
why
but
it
is
as
true
as
i
stand
here
then
you
will
kill
our
mother
said
effie
i
know
that
and
father
left
her
to
you
george
it
can
not
be
i
must
think
of
something
my
head
is
giddy
we
have
not
any
money
to
spare
it
will
be
the
hardest
fight
in
the
world
to
keep
the
children
from
starvation
on
that
hundred
pounds
a
year
but
something
must
be
done
i
go
and
speak
to
the
trustees
who
are
the
trustees
asked
george
he
rose
again
to
his
feet
there
was
a
dull
sort
of
patience
in
his
words
watson
is
one
you
know
the
watsons
father
has
always
been
so
good
to
them
and
our
clergyman
jellet
is
the
other
yes
i
must
go
and
speak
to
them
but
what
am
i
to
say
you
must
not
betray
me
said
george
if
you
mention
that
i
want
the
money
all
will
be
up
with
me
in
any
case
there
may
be
suspicion
men
of
the
world
like
watson
and
jellet
would
immediately
guess
there
was
something
wrong
if
a
lad
required
such
a
large
sum
of
money
you
must
not
tell
them
that
want
it
how
can
i
help
it
oh
everything
is
swimming
round
before
my
eyes
i
feel
as
if
my
head
would
burst
think
of
me
said
george
think
of
the
load
i
have
got
to
bear
effie
glanced
up
at
him
his
attitude
and
his
words
puzzled
and
almost
revolted
her
after
a
time
she
said
coldly
what
hour
are
you
leaving
in
the
morning
i
want
to
catch
the
train
to
town
this
is
effie
i
sha
see
you
before
i
go
remember
there
are
six
weeks
before
anything
can
happen
if
anyone
can
save
me
you
can
it
is
worth
a
sacrifice
to
keep
our
mother
from
dying
yes
it
would
kill
her
said
effie
now
george
i
can
not
think
nor
counsel
you
at
present
i
feel
too
stunned
the
blow
you
have
given
me
has
come
so
unexpectedly
and
it
it
is
so
awful
but
i
get
up
to
see
you
off
in
the
morning
some
thought
may
occur
to
me
during
the
night
very
well
said
george
he
walked
slowly
down
the
garden
and
entering
the
house
went
up
to
his
own
room
effie
did
not
go
in
for
a
long
time
she
was
alone
now
all
alone
with
the
stars
she
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
path
often
and
often
her
father
steps
had
trodden
this
path
he
used
to
pace
here
when
he
was
troubled
about
a
sick
patient
when
his
anxiety
about
her
mother
arose
to
a
feverish
pitch
now
his
daughter
stood
on
the
same
spot
while
a
whirl
of
troubled
thoughts
passed
through
her
brain
it
had
been
her
one
comfort
since
that
awful
moment
when
dorothy
had
told
her
that
her
father
was
gone
to
feel
that
george
in
a
measure
at
least
took
that
father
place
george
had
always
been
her
favorite
brother
they
were
very
nearly
the
same
age
effie
was
only
two
years
younger
than
george
long
ago
george
had
been
good
to
the
little
sister
they
had
never
quarreled
they
had
grown
up
always
the
best
and
warmest
of
friends
their
love
had
been
true
as
true
as
anything
in
all
the
world
george
had
gone
to
london
and
the
first
tiny
spark
of
discontent
had
visited
effie
heart
she
would
be
so
lonely
without
her
brother
it
was
so
fine
for
him
to
go
out
into
life
her
own
horizon
seemed
so
narrow
then
dorothy
came
and
they
had
made
friends
and
dorothy
told
her
what
some
women
did
with
their
lives
effie
had
been
fired
with
a
sudden
desire
to
follow
in
dorothy
steps
then
had
followed
the
dark
cloud
which
seemed
to
swallow
up
her
wishes
and
all
that
was
best
out
of
her
life
george
at
least
remained
dear
brave
manly
george
the
brother
who
had
passed
out
of
childhood
and
entered
man
estate
her
father
last
message
had
been
to
george
he
had
given
her
precious
mother
into
george
care
it
seemed
to
effie
standing
out
under
the
stars
as
if
george
too
were
dead
the
old
george
was
really
dead
and
a
stranger
had
taken
his
place
this
stranger
wore
the
outward
guise
of
her
brother
he
had
his
eyes
his
figure
his
voice
had
the
same
tone
he
could
look
at
you
just
in
george
way
but
he
could
utter
terrible
words
which
george
had
never
known
anything
about
he
could
talk
of
and
he
could
propose
that
effie
should
rescue
him
at
the
risk
of
her
livelihood
oh
what
did
it
mean
how
was
she
to
bear
it
how
could
she
bear
it
she
clasped
her
hands
tears
filled
her
eyes
but
she
was
too
oppressed
too
pained
too
stunned
to
weep
long
presently
she
went
into
the
house
and
lay
down
on
her
bed
without
undressing
during
the
whole
of
that
terrible
night
effie
scarcely
slept
it
was
the
worst
night
in
all
her
life
toward
morning
she
dozed
a
little
but
sprang
up
with
a
start
fearing
that
george
had
gone
to
london
without
seeing
her
for
her
mother
sake
she
must
see
him
whatever
happened
her
mother
must
never
know
of
this
calamity
effie
got
up
washed
her
hands
and
face
smoothed
out
her
hair
and
went
downstairs
george
was
already
up
he
was
standing
in
the
little
parlor
he
turned
round
when
he
heard
his
sister
footsteps
and
looked
anxiously
at
her
what
a
brute
i
am
he
said
when
he
saw
the
expression
on
her
face
but
i
swear
before
god
effie
if
you
will
help
me
i
turn
over
a
new
leaf
i
never
do
a
wrong
thing
again
as
long
as
i
live
i
swear
it
do
swear
it
said
effie
it
seems
to
make
it
worse
to
do
that
if
you
did
wrong
once
you
may
again
do
swear
ask
god
to
help
you
i
do
know
that
i
have
been
praying
all
night
but
i
have
been
trying
to
well
effie
what
have
you
determined
to
do
he
asked
is
there
no
one
else
who
can
help
you
george
not
a
soul
i
have
only
one
friend
and
that
is
fred
lawson
oh
yes
i
remember
you
spoke
of
him
last
night
would
he
help
you
he
help
me
said
george
with
a
hysterical
laugh
why
he
is
the
chap
i
have
wronged
there
do
ask
me
any
more
if
you
can
help
me
i
am
saved
if
you
ca
say
so
and
i
go
straight
to
destruction
no
you
sha
do
that
george
i
have
thought
of
something
nothing
may
come
of
it
but
i
going
to
try
it
is
terribly
repugnant
to
me
but
i
would
sacrifice
much
to
save
my
mother
if
it
fails
all
fails
i
have
thought
said
george
eagerly
that
as
the
case
is
such
an
extreme
one
we
might
take
some
of
the
capital
there
is
a
thousand
pounds
a
quarter
of
that
sum
would
put
me
right
it
can
not
be
done
for
a
moment
said
effie
her
face
flushing
hotly
that
money
must
under
no
circumstances
be
touched
my
mother
and
the
children
depend
on
it
for
their
bread
i
do
know
what
is
to
be
done
then
said
george
in
a
hopeless
voice
you
must
trust
to
me
george
i
am
going
to
try
to
help
you
in
my
own
way
if
i
fail
i
fail
but
somehow
i
do
think
i
shall
if
i
have
any
news
i
will
write
to
you
soon
and
now
george
turned
and
kissed
effie
she
gave
him
her
cheek
but
her
lips
did
not
touch
his
she
was
willing
to
help
him
but
her
love
for
the
time
was
dead
or
dying
the
young
man
walked
hurriedly
down
the
village
street
effie
stood
in
the
porch
and
watched
him
his
shoulders
were
bowed
he
stooped
george
used
to
have
a
fine
figure
effie
used
to
be
proud
of
him
she
was
not
proud
of
her
brother
now
she
went
back
to
the
house
and
sat
down
listlessly
for
a
time
in
the
little
parlor
her
hands
were
folded
in
her
lap
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
the
end
of
all
things
had
come
presently
the
sound
of
the
children
voices
overhead
aroused
her
she
went
upstairs
and
helped
susan
to
dress
them
returning
to
the
everyday
duties
of
life
had
a
soothing
effect
upon
her
she
made
a
violent
effort
and
managed
to
put
her
trouble
behind
her
for
the
time
being
whatever
happened
her
mother
must
not
see
any
traces
of
it
when
the
baby
was
dressed
she
took
him
as
usual
to
her
mother
room
staunton
sat
up
in
bed
and
stretched
out
her
arms
to
receive
him
effie
gave
him
to
her
mother
who
began
to
kiss
his
little
face
hungrily
has
george
gone
effie
said
the
mother
yes
mother
dear
did
anyone
see
him
off
did
he
have
his
breakfast
yes
he
had
a
good
breakfast
i
got
it
ready
for
him
last
night
but
did
anyone
see
him
off
i
did
that
right
i
should
not
have
liked
him
to
have
had
his
last
meal
by
himself
i
miss
him
awfully
effie
dear
how
soon
do
you
think
we
can
go
to
london
as
soon
as
possible
mother
in
about
six
weeks
six
weeks
exclaimed
staunton
i
ca
live
without
george
for
six
weeks
oh
yes
you
can
mother
at
least
you
try
chapter
xii
when
effie
had
finished
the
many
small
duties
which
fell
to
her
share
in
the
household
economy
she
went
up
to
her
bedroom
and
hastily
changed
her
everyday
dress
for
her
best
one
she
did
not
take
long
about
this
task
her
small
face
looked
very
pale
and
thin
under
the
heavy
crêpe
on
her
hat
taking
up
her
gloves
she
ran
down
to
the
parlor
where
her
mother
was
sitting
staunton
was
busily
mending
some
stockings
for
george
a
pile
of
his
clothes
lay
on
the
table
by
her
side
i
thought
we
might
send
these
to
london
next
week
she
said
looking
up
as
her
daughter
entered
the
room
george
will
want
a
really
warm
greatcoat
for
the
winter
and
this
one
of
your
father
why
effie
my
dear
she
stopped
abruptly
and
gazed
up
at
effie
best
hat
where
are
you
going
my
love
she
said
i
thought
you
could
help
me
this
morning
i
am
going
out
mother
for
a
little
but
where
to
why
have
you
your
best
things
on
i
am
going
to
the
harveys
to
the
harveys
to
the
grange
staunton
shuddered
slightly
she
turned
her
head
aside
why
are
you
going
there
she
asked
after
a
pause
i
want
to
see
them
i
wo
be
long
away
please
mother
do
tire
yourself
over
all
that
mending
now
it
interests
me
my
dear
i
find
it
impossible
to
sit
with
my
hands
before
me
i
am
stronger
than
i
used
to
be
i
have
got
to
live
for
george
and
george
is
young
he
is
entering
life
he
must
not
be
saddled
with
an
old
ailing
mother
i
must
get
strong
i
must
get
back
my
youth
for
his
sake
do
be
long
away
effie
dear
i
wonder
you
like
to
go
to
the
harveys
under
the
circumstances
but
you
know
best
children
are
very
independent
nowadays
concluded
staunton
with
a
sigh
effie
went
up
to
her
mother
and
kissed
her
then
she
softly
left
the
room
the
day
was
a
particularly
fine
one
the
sun
shone
brightly
upon
the
little
high
street
effie
walked
quickly
she
soon
turned
into
a
shady
lane
the
lane
led
her
into
the
highroad
by
and
by
she
stopped
at
the
gates
of
the
grange
the
woman
of
the
lodge
came
out
when
she
saw
her
this
woman
had
been
fond
of
staunton
and
she
recognized
effie
effie
little
figure
her
heavy
black
dress
her
crêpe
hat
her
white
cheeks
and
dark
eyes
all
appealed
with
great
pathos
to
the
woman
she
ran
towards
her
with
outstretched
hands
miss
effie
my
dear
you
welcome
she
said
she
caught
little
white
hands
in
her
hard
ones
you
are
welcome
miss
effie
she
repeated
it
is
good
of
you
to
come
eh
dear
but
it
goes
to
the
heart
to
see
you
in
that
deep
black
come
in
and
rest
my
dear
young
lady
come
in
and
rest
i
can
not
just
now
jones
replied
effie
i
am
in
a
hurry
i
want
to
go
up
to
see
the
squire
on
business
and
how
is
your
mother
poor
lady
how
is
she
bearing
up
my
dear
wonderfully
said
effie
i
come
and
see
you
another
day
mrs
jones
eh
do
you
be
more
than
welcome
i
long
to
hear
all
about
the
doctor
poor
man
and
how
he
went
off
at
the
end
the
last
words
of
the
pious
are
always
worth
listening
to
i
be
glad
to
hear
particulars
if
you
can
give
me
half
an
hour
some
time
miss
effie
some
time
said
effie
she
walked
on
trembling
a
little
the
woman
words
and
her
eager
look
of
curiosity
were
dreadful
to
her
nevertheless
she
knew
that
her
father
under
similar
circumstances
would
have
been
very
patient
with
this
woman
by
and
by
she
arrived
at
the
heavy
front
door
of
the
old
grange
she
walked
up
the
steps
and
rang
the
bell
the
door
was
opened
almost
immediately
by
a
servant
in
livery
he
knew
effie
and
asked
her
in
is
the
squire
at
home
she
asked
i
am
not
sure
miss
but
i
inquire
will
you
step
in
here
while
i
go
to
ask
the
man
opened
the
door
of
a
little
sitting
room
effie
went
in
and
he
closed
it
softly
behind
him
after
what
seemed
a
very
short
time
she
heard
eager
steps
coming
along
the
hall
the
room
door
was
flung
open
and
squire
harvey
accompanied
by
his
wife
came
in
harvey
looked
like
a
shadow
but
her
sweet
face
had
a
tender
color
about
it
her
eyes
had
the
intensely
clear
look
which
long
illness
gives
she
was
better
but
she
looked
so
frail
and
delicate
that
effie
heart
went
out
to
her
my
dear
child
said
harvey
how
good
how
very
good
of
you
to
come
i
am
only
just
downstairs
edwards
only
allowed
me
down
yesterday
but
i
could
not
resist
coming
to
welcome
you
myself
you
come
into
my
sitting
room
it
is
just
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
hall
i
send
rhoda
upstairs
to
fetch
little
freda
she
will
be
so
enraptured
at
seeing
you
come
my
dear
now
that
we
have
got
you
we
wo
let
you
go
in
a
hurry
i
think
it
so
sweet
of
you
to
come
to
see
us
and
under
the
circumstances
do
you
think
it
is
sweet
of
her
walter
dear
squire
harvey
had
more
perception
of
character
than
his
wife
he
noticed
how
white
effie
face
grew
he
noticed
the
pathetic
trembling
of
her
hands
my
dear
he
said
perhaps
miss
staunton
wishes
to
see
me
by
herself
i
understood
from
the
servant
that
she
had
asked
for
me
yes
i
did
want
to
see
you
very
much
said
effie
of
course
dear
little
thing
interrupted
harvey
but
i
stay
while
you
talk
to
her
i
am
immensely
interested
in
you
miss
staunton
i
can
never
forget
as
long
as
i
live
what
you
and
yours
have
done
for
us
please
do
talk
of
it
now
said
effie
i
mean
i
know
how
kindly
you
feel
and
indeed
i
am
not
ungrateful
but
i
can
not
bear
to
talk
it
over
and
i
want
very
badly
please
to
say
something
to
the
squire
come
with
me
to
my
study
miss
staunton
said
the
squire
he
opened
the
door
and
effie
followed
him
be
sure
you
make
her
stay
walter
when
your
business
is
over
called
harvey
after
him
i
send
for
freda
to
my
boudoir
miss
staunton
must
stay
to
lunch
it
is
delightful
to
see
her
again
and
it
is
so
sweet
of
her
to
come
to
see
us
the
thin
high
voice
kept
calling
these
words
out
a
little
louder
and
a
little
louder
as
effie
followed
the
squire
down
one
long
corridor
after
another
until
at
last
they
entered
his
special
study
he
shut
the
door
at
once
and
offered
her
a
chair
if
i
can
do
anything
for
you
you
have
but
to
command
me
he
said
i
see
you
are
in
great
trouble
he
continued
pray
take
your
own
time
i
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
i
can
listen
to
you
as
long
as
ever
you
like
poor
effie
found
great
difficulty
in
using
her
voice
for
one
dreadful
moment
words
seemed
to
fail
her
altogether
then
she
gave
a
swift
thought
to
her
mother
to
george
and
her
resolve
was
taken
i
want
to
make
a
very
queer
request
of
you
harvey
she
said
it
may
not
be
possible
for
you
to
grant
it
for
my
father
sake
will
you
promise
that
you
will
never
tell
anyone
what
i
am
now
asking
you
if
you
do
find
it
convenient
to
grant
it
to
me
i
keep
your
secret
of
course
said
the
squire
but
permit
me
to
say
one
thing
before
you
begin
to
tell
it
to
me
there
not
the
slightest
fear
of
my
not
granting
it
there
is
nothing
that
you
can
possibly
ask
of
me
that
under
the
circumstances
i
should
think
it
right
to
refuse
now
pray
proceed
i
want
you
said
effie
she
gulped
down
a
great
lump
in
her
throat
and
proceeded
in
a
sort
of
desperation
i
want
you
to
lend
me
pounds
i
pay
you
interest
i
think
five
per
cent
is
fair
interest
i
pay
you
interest
on
the
money
and
return
it
to
you
by
installments
there
was
not
the
least
doubt
that
effie
request
startled
the
squire
the
amount
of
the
money
required
was
nothing
to
him
for
he
was
a
very
rich
man
but
the
girl
manner
her
evident
distress
the
look
of
shame
and
misery
on
her
face
surprised
him
he
guessed
that
she
was
borrowing
the
money
for
another
but
for
whom
i
can
see
you
are
in
trouble
he
said
in
his
kindest
tone
why
you
confide
in
me
as
to
the
money
make
your
mind
easy
you
shall
have
it
but
girls
like
you
do
as
a
rule
borrow
a
large
sum
of
money
of
this
kind
do
you
want
it
for
yourself
no
you
wo
tell
me
who
it
is
for
i
can
not
harvey
please
do
ask
me
i
wo
ask
you
anything
that
distresses
you
as
you
are
talking
of
money
you
will
forgive
me
for
saying
that
i
am
told
that
your
mother
is
left
badly
off
no
that
a
mistake
said
effie
she
has
money
my
father
left
her
very
well
off
for
a
man
in
his
position
he
insured
his
life
for
a
thousand
pounds
and
my
mother
had
a
little
fortune
of
her
own
which
brings
in
about
sixty
pounds
a
year
and
you
think
your
mother
well
off
with
that
said
the
squire
in
a
tone
of
almost
amused
pity
yes
for
a
woman
in
her
position
said
effie
in
almost
a
proud
tone
forgive
me
she
said
i
know
that
after
the
request
i
have
just
made
you
would
be
justified
in
asking
me
any
questions
but
i
would
rather
not
say
any
more
about
my
mother
if
you
lend
me
the
money
if
indeed
you
will
be
so
good
so
noble
when
can
i
have
it
when
do
you
want
it
i
must
have
it
before
six
weeks
are
up
but
the
sooner
the
better
you
shall
have
it
in
a
week
come
here
this
day
week
and
i
give
you
a
check
for
the
amount
a
check
said
effie
but
i
would
have
to
pass
that
through
bank
and
and
she
might
know
are
you
really
asking
for
this
money
without
your
mother
knowledge
miss
staunton
yes
my
mother
is
not
to
know
harvey
the
object
of
our
lives
is
to
keep
all
anxiety
from
our
mother
she
must
never
know
forgive
me
said
the
squire
after
a
pause
i
know
a
great
deal
about
business
and
you
very
little
would
it
not
be
best
to
open
an
account
in
your
own
name
i
am
told
that
you
propose
soon
to
go
to
london
i
would
introduce
you
to
my
bankers
there
who
would
be
very
glad
to
open
an
account
with
you
and
if
at
any
time
you
should
have
need
of
assistance
miss
staunton
you
would
give
me
the
privilege
of
helping
you
remember
but
for
me
and
mine
you
would
not
now
be
fatherless
you
must
see
that
you
have
a
claim
on
me
allow
me
to
fulfill
that
claim
in
the
only
possible
way
in
my
power
you
are
good
you
are
more
than
good
said
effie
rising
but
this
is
all
i
really
need
i
pay
you
the
interest
on
the
money
every
half
year
oh
that
does
matter
i
earnestly
wish
you
would
take
it
as
a
gift
thank
you
but
that
is
impossible
effie
stood
up
she
had
nothing
further
to
say
may
i
take
you
to
my
wife
room
now
said
the
squire
i
know
she
is
waiting
to
see
you
she
is
longing
to
be
friends
with
you
her
recovery
has
been
wonderful
and
as
to
little
freda
she
is
almost
herself
again
you
would
like
to
see
freda
would
you
not
yes
said
effie
but
not
i
must
hurry
back
to
my
mother
i
do
know
how
to
thank
you
harvey
will
you
please
tell
your
your
wife
that
i
can
not
stay
my
mother
wants
me
thank
you
thank
you
the
squire
himself
showed
effie
out
he
stood
for
a
moment
by
his
open
hall
door
watched
her
as
she
walked
slowly
down
the
avenue
that
is
a
plucky
little
thing
he
said
to
himself
now
what
in
the
world
does
she
want
that
money
for
not
for
herself
i
be
bound
i
do
hope
she
has
got
no
disreputable
relations
hanging
onto
her
well
at
least
it
is
my
bounden
duty
to
help
her
but
i
wish
she
would
confide
in
me
she
is
a
pretty
girl
too
and
has
a
look
of
the
doctor
about
her
eyes
where
is
miss
staunton
asked
harvey
coming
forward
vanishing
round
that
corner
my
love
returned
the
squire
the
fact
is
the
poor
little
thing
is
completely
upset
and
can
not
face
anyone
but
her
business
walter
what
did
she
want
ah
that
the
secret
she
made
me
swear
not
to
tell
anyone
it
is
my
opinion
elfreda
that
the
child
has
got
into
trouble
we
must
do
what
we
can
for
her
i
wish
she
would
come
here
and
be
freda
governess
said
harvey
the
squire
looked
at
his
wife
that
a
good
thought
he
remarked
and
we
might
give
her
a
big
salary
she
is
so
innocent
she
would
not
really
know
anything
about
it
we
might
give
her
two
hundred
a
year
and
then
she
could
help
her
mother
but
i
doubt
whether
she
would
leave
her
mother
she
seems
simply
bound
up
in
her
it
is
our
duty
to
help
her
said
harvey
whatever
happens
if
she
wo
come
to
us
we
must
think
of
some
other
way
yes
we
must
said
the
squire
chapter
xiii
in
less
than
six
weeks
the
stauntons
were
settled
in
london
george
had
taken
lodgings
for
them
in
a
cheap
part
of
bayswater
the
rooms
were
high
up
in
a
dismal
sort
of
house
there
were
a
sitting
room
and
three
small
bedrooms
george
occupied
one
effie
and
the
girls
another
staunton
the
baby
and
little
phil
the
third
it
seemed
to
effie
as
if
they
had
always
lived
in
this
uninteresting
house
looking
out
on
that
narrow
dismal
street
they
knew
nobody
their
lives
were
very
dull
staunton
occupied
herself
over
george
morning
noon
and
night
she
mended
his
clothes
with
scrupulous
care
she
washed
his
shirts
herself
and
took
immense
pride
in
bringing
the
fronts
up
to
a
wonderful
polish
there
was
not
a
young
man
in
the
city
who
went
to
his
daily
work
with
such
snowy
collars
as
george
such
neat
cuffs
such
a
look
of
general
finish
this
work
delighted
staunton
it
brought
smiles
to
her
eyes
and
a
look
of
satisfaction
to
her
face
effie
had
got
the
money
from
harvey
and
had
handed
it
without
a
word
to
george
he
took
it
his
face
flushed
all
over
tears
filled
his
eyes
he
said
god
bless
you
effie
you
are
the
bravest
best
sister
a
man
ever
had
and
then
he
went
out
of
the
room
and
out
of
the
house
he
never
asked
me
where
i
got
it
thought
poor
effie
and
now
the
interest
to
pay
and
how
can
it
possibly
be
taken
out
of
our
hundred
a
year
mother
must
never
never
know
but
how
is
that
interest
to
be
paid
the
stauntons
had
been
settled
about
a
fortnight
in
their
new
home
when
dorothy
came
to
pay
them
a
visit
she
was
very
busy
in
her
hospital
life
she
came
in
with
her
accustomed
eager
purposeful
walk
she
sat
down
on
the
nearest
chair
and
began
to
talk
cheerfully
to
the
children
and
sympathetically
to
staunton
as
soon
as
she
had
an
opportunity
however
she
drew
effie
aside
now
my
dear
she
said
looking
straight
into
effie
brown
eyes
when
are
you
coming
to
us
oh
if
i
could
come
exclaimed
effie
i
should
indeed
be
happy
but
i
do
see
any
chance
of
it
i
do
you
are
not
really
wanted
here
agnes
is
growing
a
big
girl
your
mother
is
devoted
to
your
brother
george
provided
he
comes
home
every
evening
she
scarcely
gives
a
thought
to
anyone
else
you
can
be
spared
effie
and
it
will
be
good
for
you
you
do
not
look
a
bit
the
same
girl
you
have
lost
your
somehow
you
are
very
young
it
is
wrong
to
have
a
look
like
that
when
one
is
only
twenty
you
ought
to
come
to
the
hospital
and
there
is
a
vacancy
now
for
a
probationer
if
you
can
take
it
if
i
dare
to
said
effie
but
it
does
not
seem
right
yes
i
believe
it
is
right
i
know
the
matron
of
joseph
hospital
so
well
that
i
think
i
can
arrange
with
her
that
you
should
spend
a
part
of
every
sunday
at
home
at
least
while
you
are
training
agnes
the
fact
is
effie
you
are
a
born
nurse
and
it
is
a
sin
to
lose
you
to
the
profession
i
should
like
to
come
beyond
anything
said
effie
it
is
the
very
highest
wish
of
my
heart
the
last
night
that
i
ever
saw
my
dear
father
he
spoke
to
me
on
this
subject
he
used
to
hate
but
you
won
him
over
dorothy
and
he
said
if
the
time
came
i
could
go
with
his
blessing
then
surely
that
settles
the
matter
exclaimed
dorothy
i
speak
to
staunton
before
i
leave
oh
no
do
mother
seems
quite
happy
and
comfortable
i
would
not
for
the
world
do
anything
to
upset
or
distress
her
if
it
upsets
and
distresses
her
you
must
give
it
up
that
all
said
dorothy
but
it
is
worth
sounding
her
on
the
subject
do
say
a
word
effie
i
speak
to
your
mother
about
it
effie
looked
puzzled
and
anxious
i
would
give
anything
to
go
she
murmured
to
herself
it
is
torture
to
live
on
here
thinking
of
nothing
but
how
to
make
a
hundred
pounds
a
year
pay
everything
that
is
expected
of
it
then
i
should
be
one
off
the
family
purse
for
all
my
expenses
would
be
paid
by
the
hospital
yes
surely
it
must
be
right
at
any
rate
i
allow
dorothy
to
speak
when
tea
was
over
george
who
had
come
in
and
was
as
usual
devoting
himself
to
his
mother
tried
to
coax
her
to
come
out
with
him
a
little
no
not
said
dorothy
suddenly
i
have
something
very
special
to
say
to
staunton
perhaps
you
would
stay
and
listen
too
george
george
did
not
mind
being
called
by
his
christian
name
by
dorothy
she
was
regarded
by
the
stauntons
as
part
and
parcel
of
the
family
i
do
anything
to
oblige
you
he
said
giving
the
handsome
nurse
a
look
of
genuine
admiration
come
mother
if
we
are
not
to
go
out
we
can
at
least
sit
near
each
other
he
drew
up
a
chair
close
to
his
mother
as
he
spoke
and
put
one
of
his
arms
round
her
neck
she
leaned
her
head
on
his
shoulder
and
sat
there
in
perfect
content
after
a
time
one
of
his
strong
hands
closed
over
hers
she
had
never
even
in
the
doctor
time
felt
more
warmly
and
happily
protected
yes
dorothy
what
have
you
to
say
she
remarked
george
and
i
are
all
attention
george
and
you
laughed
dorothy
i
never
saw
such
a
devoted
pair
why
you
are
just
like
a
pair
of
lovers
well
we
are
lovers
are
we
mother
said
the
son
yes
my
boy
she
replied
no
love
was
ever
stronger
than
that
which
binds
us
together
i
love
to
hear
you
say
that
remarked
dorothy
but
now
i
want
to
talk
on
quite
another
matter
i
am
very
anxious
about
effie
effie
said
staunton
just
glancing
at
her
daughter
what
about
her
she
seems
quite
well
are
you
well
effie
yes
mother
i
am
perfectly
well
replied
effie
oh
it
is
not
that
said
dorothy
a
touch
of
scorn
coming
into
her
voice
effie
may
be
well
in
body
but
she
is
just
starved
in
soul
starved
said
staunton
with
a
start
what
do
you
mean
dorothy
oh
never
mind
her
please
mother
said
effie
in
distress
i
am
all
right
really
no
she
is
not
continued
dorothy
she
is
not
right
in
the
way
i
should
like
to
see
her
right
the
fact
is
she
wants
a
change
poor
child
said
staunton
we
are
not
rich
enough
to
think
of
changes
the
sort
of
change
she
wants
will
not
cost
you
any
money
the
fact
is
i
want
her
to
become
what
heaven
has
intended
her
to
be
a
thoroughly
trained
hospital
nurse
there
is
a
vacancy
now
for
a
probationer
at
joseph
and
i
can
get
her
admitted
at
once
may
she
come
that
the
main
point
to
consider
staunton
looked
at
effie
effie
looked
back
at
her
mother
it
seemed
to
effie
at
that
moment
as
if
she
would
have
given
anything
for
her
mother
to
say
no
i
can
not
spare
her
on
the
contrary
staunton
said
in
a
calm
voice
i
leave
the
choice
entirely
to
effie
herself
if
she
thinks
she
can
be
spared
she
may
go
the
fact
is
effie
my
love
your
your
dear
father
spoke
to
me
on
this
subject
the
very
night
he
was
taken
ill
he
seemed
to
wish
it
then
that
is
if
you
cared
for
it
yourself
if
you
are
still
of
the
same
way
of
thinking
i
for
one
should
not
think
it
right
to
make
the
slightest
opposition
but
how
are
you
to
do
without
her
asked
george
in
some
dismay
oh
i
can
manage
i
am
not
the
helpless
old
woman
you
seem
to
consider
me
george
i
really
feel
better
and
stronger
every
day
the
more
i
do
for
you
the
less
of
an
invalid
i
seem
to
be
effie
has
been
quite
tiresome
lately
trying
to
manage
the
money
and
taking
all
care
off
my
hands
but
i
am
quite
capable
of
seeing
to
matters
myself
and
then
agnes
is
growing
a
big
girl
she
can
go
out
to
buy
what
i
shall
order
effie
looked
very
pale
she
sat
perfectly
still
for
a
moment
then
she
stood
up
very
well
mother
i
go
she
said
in
a
subdued
voice
when
can
you
be
ready
for
me
dorothy
she
continued
in
a
week
time
said
dorothy
there
are
certain
preliminaries
to
be
gone
through
but
i
will
send
you
a
paper
of
our
rules
you
must
fill
up
a
form
in
short
you
must
do
exactly
what
you
are
instructed
to
do
on
the
paper
you
will
probably
be
admitted
before
this
day
week
dorothy
said
a
few
more
words
and
then
took
her
leave
effie
accompanied
her
out
on
the
landing
i
think
you
make
a
mistake
in
letting
effie
go
mother
said
george
when
he
was
alone
with
his
mother
not
at
all
my
son
the
fact
is
fond
as
i
am
of
my
dear
effie
she
takes
almost
too
much
control
lately
of
our
money
affairs
i
shall
be
glad
to
get
them
into
my
own
hands
there
are
very
many
comforts
which
i
could
give
you
darling
which
are
simply
put
out
of
my
power
by
determination
to
keep
the
family
purse
george
said
nothing
he
stooped
to
kiss
his
mother
cheek
he
had
not
looked
at
matters
from
that
point
of
view
before
he
allowed
his
mother
fifty
pounds
a
year
which
was
half
his
present
income
and
it
suddenly
occurred
to
him
that
he
was
making
a
very
generous
allowance
and
that
he
should
have
a
full
share
of
the
benefit
what
i
have
been
thinking
is
this
said
staunton
out
of
the
fifty
pounds
a
year
which
you
dear
boy
give
us
we
ought
to
provide
a
certain
portion
of
your
wardrobe
you
really
want
new
shirts
i
suggested
to
effie
a
week
ago
that
i
should
like
her
to
buy
some
fine
lawn
as
i
wanted
to
make
them
for
you
and
she
said
at
once
that
we
could
not
afford
it
but
never
mind
dearest
when
mother
is
put
into
her
own
position
again
you
shall
have
the
best
shirts
of
any
young
man
in
the
city
now
george
was
really
satisfied
with
his
present
shirts
but
if
his
mother
chose
to
make
him
better
ones
he
did
not
care
to
oppose
her
he
hoped
that
he
would
be
asked
out
a
little
in
the
evenings
during
the
coming
winter
and
he
wondered
if
his
mother
could
possibly
squeeze
an
evening
suit
for
him
out
of
the
allowance
he
gave
her
he
did
not
express
this
thought
however
at
the
present
moment
and
as
effie
the
room
the
two
changed
the
conversation
george
went
out
for
a
little
and
effie
took
up
some
needlework
sitting
where
the
lamp
in
the
center
of
the
table
fell
full
upon
her
bright
brown
hair
i
wonder
effie
said
staunton
in
a
tone
of
almost
discontent
that
you
did
not
speak
to
me
before
now
on
this
subject
i
can
not
bear
to
think
that
a
child
of
mine
does
not
give
me
her
full
confidence
you
know
i
am
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
keep
you
drudging
and
toiling
at
home
when
you
yourself
long
for
a
wider
field
of
usefulness
yes
mother
i
know
that
said
effie
in
a
grave
voice
the
fact
is
she
continued
i
did
not
think
it
would
be
possible
for
you
to
spare
me
but
if
you
can
and
you
think
it
right
for
me
to
go
i
shall
of
course
be
delighted
for
i
have
long
had
my
heart
in
this
work
you
are
like
all
other
modern
girls
said
staunton
in
that
provokingly
inconsistent
way
which
characterized
her
you
are
not
satisfied
in
the
home
nest
well
well
i
have
got
my
boy
and
i
must
not
complain
oh
mother
dear
mother
you
have
got
us
all
effie
rose
from
her
chair
went
over
and
knelt
by
her
mother
side
i
would
give
anything
in
the
world
she
said
looking
full
at
staunton
for
you
to
say
that
you
are
going
to
miss
me
awfully
the
sight
of
her
pretty
face
softened
the
mother
heart
of
course
i
shall
miss
you
my
darling
she
said
you
always
were
the
best
of
girls
but
i
do
wish
to
stand
in
your
way
i
know
you
will
be
happy
where
your
heart
is
and
your
father
wished
it
that
in
my
opinion
settles
the
matter
well
i
have
a
week
said
effie
more
cheerfully
standing
up
as
she
spoke
i
must
do
all
in
my
power
to
instruct
agnes
i
must
teach
her
the
little
economies
which
i
have
been
trying
to
practice
no
you
need
not
do
that
effie
when
you
go
to
the
hospital
i
intend
to
resume
full
control
of
the
family
purse
effie
hesitated
and
looked
anxiously
at
her
mother
as
she
said
this
i
wish
it
my
love
so
there
no
use
in
discussing
the
matter
continued
staunton
i
know
exactly
what
we
have
got
to
spend
a
year
it
is
very
little
indeed
but
i
rather
fancy
i
am
as
good
a
manager
as
my
child
i
have
at
least
a
wider
experience
to
guide
me
out
of
that
income
dear
george
provides
a
third
it
seems
to
me
effie
that
we
should
give
him
rather
more
comforts
than
he
has
had
lately
for
this
generous
allowance
oh
mother
george
really
wants
for
nothing
i
can
not
agree
with
you
i
should
wish
him
to
have
beer
at
supper
every
night
i
do
not
think
it
can
be
managed
there
is
not
a
penny
to
spare
well
my
dear
we
will
see
it
is
also
only
just
that
a
proportion
of
his
money
should
be
devoted
to
providing
him
with
suitable
underclothing
oh
mother
mother
have
you
thought
of
the
thousand
and
one
things
which
are
required
for
the
children
and
yourself
surely
george
can
manage
to
buy
his
own
clothes
out
of
the
fifty
pounds
which
he
reserves
for
his
personal
expenses
that
so
like
a
girl
exclaimed
staunton
clasping
her
hands
she
knows
about
as
little
of
a
young
man
life
as
she
does
of
his
greek
and
latin
well
my
love
we
will
propose
no
changes
while
you
are
at
home
you
must
go
to
the
hospital
with
a
light
heart
taking
your
mother
blessing
with
you
a
light
heart
indeed
thought
poor
effie
when
she
reached
her
room
that
night
a
light
heart
with
mother
spoiling
george
as
hard
as
ever
she
can
i
wonder
how
the
others
are
to
fare
when
george
is
to
be
treated
like
a
prince
in
every
way
and
i
wonder
how
that
interest
is
to
be
met
oh
dear
oh
dear
but
it
shall
be
paid
somehow
well
i
suppose
i
am
doing
right
mother
would
not
have
been
content
with
this
state
of
things
much
longer
that
more
than
evident
and
then
my
dear
father
wished
it
yes
i
take
up
my
new
life
i
trust
it
will
bring
a
blessing
with
it
but
oh
mother
how
anxious
you
make
me
chapter
xiv
in
a
week
time
effie
found
herself
an
inmate
in
the
great
hospital
which
for
present
purposes
we
will
call
by
the
name
of
joseph
it
was
situated
in
the
east
of
london
dorothy
had
been
trained
here
and
was
now
superintendent
of
one
of
the
wards
effie
was
to
go
up
for
a
month
trial
at
the
end
of
that
time
she
would
be
paid
at
the
rate
of
twelve
pounds
the
first
year
and
twenty
pounds
the
second
her
training
would
take
two
years
a
certain
amount
of
her
uniform
would
be
also
provided
and
everything
found
for
her
with
the
exception
of
washing
she
did
not
soon
forget
the
evening
of
her
arrival
she
had
said
to
her
mother
had
kissed
the
children
had
given
agnes
all
final
directions
and
at
last
found
herself
in
the
cab
which
was
to
take
her
to
joseph
it
drew
up
presently
outside
one
of
the
large
entrance
doors
a
lady
who
was
called
the
home
sister
received
effie
very
kindly
and
offered
her
a
friendly
cup
of
tea
the
hour
of
her
arrival
was
about
four
in
the
afternoon
she
was
then
taken
up
to
her
own
room
and
instructed
how
to
put
her
cap
on
and
how
to
wear
her
new
uniform
in
the
neatest
and
most
compact
way
her
dress
was
a
pretty
lilac
check
and
she
wore
a
cap
with
a
frill
round
it
and
long
tails
at
the
back
her
apron
bib
was
high
to
the
collar
in
front
and
fastened
with
straps
which
crossed
at
the
back
nothing
could
be
neater
and
more
serviceable
than
the
dress
the
kind
sister
having
seen
that
effie
was
all
right
gave
her
a
friendly
smile
and
then
led
her
along
several
dim
passages
up
and
down
many
stairs
until
she
finally
found
herself
in
a
long
light
ward
where
from
thirty
to
forty
women
were
lying
in
bed
the
home
sister
introduced
effie
to
the
sister
of
the
ward
who
went
by
the
name
of
sister
kate
sister
kate
nodded
to
her
said
a
word
or
two
in
a
very
busy
voice
and
then
effie
found
herself
practically
on
the
threshold
of
her
new
life
the
sister
who
had
been
kind
to
her
during
tea
who
had
shown
her
to
her
room
and
instructed
her
how
to
dress
had
vanished
sister
kate
looked
far
too
busy
and
anxious
to
be
worried
by
questions
and
effie
capable
and
active
as
she
always
was
found
herself
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
with
nothing
to
do
and
overcome
by
strange
nervousness
she
was
too
much
embarrassed
to
be
of
real
use
her
face
was
burning
with
blushes
sister
kate
was
tired
with
her
long
work
there
was
a
great
deal
to
be
done
to
put
the
ward
straight
for
the
night
and
she
really
had
no
time
to
devote
to
the
probationer
the
women
lying
in
their
beds
seemed
to
have
eyes
and
ears
for
no
one
but
effie
between
sixty
and
seventy
eyes
turned
on
her
wherever
she
moved
whatever
she
looked
at
whatever
she
did
some
of
the
eyes
in
the
pale
and
harassed
faces
looked
kindly
and
interested
some
of
them
merely
amused
some
of
them
cross
and
discontented
effie
knew
that
these
women
would
be
querulous
and
even
rude
under
the
touch
of
strange
and
untutored
hands
at
last
the
night
nurses
arrived
the
bell
rang
and
sister
kate
came
forward
to
show
the
new
probationer
the
way
to
the
dining
hall
here
were
several
long
tables
where
the
nurses
all
dressed
exactly
alike
sat
down
to
supper
effie
took
her
place
and
quickly
discovered
that
the
others
were
far
too
tired
and
hungry
to
pay
any
attention
to
her
she
felt
too
excited
to
eat
and
sat
watching
the
faces
of
those
around
her
supper
was
immediately
followed
by
prayers
and
then
came
bed
first
evening
as
a
probationer
was
over
she
did
not
know
whether
to
cry
or
to
laugh
as
she
laid
her
head
on
her
pillow
the
reality
was
so
different
from
anything
her
fancy
had
painted
the
practical
character
of
the
work
the
absence
of
all
sentiment
the
real
illness
the
real
burden
of
humanity
seemed
to
press
down
upon
her
she
had
thought
a
week
ago
when
dorothy
proposed
that
she
should
come
to
joseph
of
the
delight
of
being
in
the
same
hospital
with
her
friend
but
she
now
discovered
that
she
was
unlikely
to
see
much
of
dorothy
even
though
she
lived
under
the
same
roof
dorothy
was
sister
of
a
ward
and
that
ward
was
not
the
one
where
effie
was
to
serve
her
probationership
she
had
the
comfort
of
a
very
small
room
to
herself
and
was
just
closing
her
eyes
in
sleep
when
the
handle
of
the
room
door
was
softly
turned
and
dorothy
looking
beautiful
in
her
sister
dress
of
soft
navy
serge
came
in
so
here
you
are
you
poor
little
thing
said
dorothy
bending
over
effie
and
kissing
her
i
have
just
come
in
for
one
minute
to
say
god
bless
you
you
have
come
the
ice
is
broken
you
have
a
fine
career
before
you
do
be
discouraged
by
what
you
saw
oh
i
am
so
lonely
said
effie
with
a
quiver
in
her
voice
i
was
sure
when
i
came
here
that
i
should
be
in
the
ward
with
you
dorothy
no
my
dear
that
was
not
possible
replied
dorothy
of
course
i
should
have
been
very
glad
if
it
could
have
been
arranged
but
i
had
no
voice
in
the
matter
as
it
can
not
be
dearest
try
to
believe
that
this
is
just
the
best
thing
that
could
have
happened
to
you
to
be
flung
at
once
as
it
were
on
your
own
feet
you
will
thus
gain
experience
without
having
a
crutch
like
me
to
lean
upon
i
know
the
first
night
is
very
bad
but
you
will
soon
learn
your
duties
and
become
intensely
interested
in
the
life
you
are
with
sister
kate
are
you
not
yes
said
effie
she
scarcely
spoke
to
me
i
never
felt
so
awkward
in
my
life
and
i
know
that
i
was
never
half
so
clumsy
of
course
said
dorothy
with
a
smile
do
i
know
the
feeling
well
it
all
passes
over
my
love
and
far
more
quickly
than
you
have
the
least
idea
of
remember
you
have
got
the
power
those
little
hands
are
capable
that
head
holds
a
steady
and
sensible
brain
why
effie
you
have
gone
through
far
worse
times
than
this
without
flinching
surely
surely
you
are
not
going
to
break
down
now
oh
i
wo
i
wo
said
effie
with
a
sob
but
i
felt
lonely
very
lonely
and
it
was
so
very
kind
of
you
to
come
to
see
me
of
course
i
have
come
to
see
you
i
am
only
too
delighted
to
do
anything
in
my
power
for
you
i
would
have
rushed
down
to
share
your
cup
of
tea
on
your
arrival
but
a
bad
case
was
just
being
brought
into
the
ward
and
i
could
not
leave
now
i
must
go
to
bed
myself
or
i
be
fit
for
work
effie
i
have
arranged
that
you
are
to
spend
every
second
sunday
at
home
oh
how
good
you
are
how
thankful
i
am
exclaimed
effie
dorothy
was
leaving
the
room
when
she
turned
back
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
you
are
very
lucky
to
be
under
sister
kate
she
said
there
is
not
a
nurse
in
the
whole
hospital
who
trains
as
she
does
and
her
probationers
always
get
the
best
certificates
at
the
end
of
the
two
years
of
training
she
looks
so
severe
and
hard
said
effie
she
is
a
little
severe
and
some
people
may
call
her
hard
but
she
has
a
tender
heart
under
all
that
strict
somewhat
cold
manner
and
then
she
is
so
just
my
dear
when
you
know
more
of
hospital
life
you
will
be
thankful
that
you
are
with
a
just
and
patient
sister
sister
kate
is
both
she
will
soon
recognize
you
effie
for
what
you
are
now
my
love
dorothy
went
away
and
soon
afterward
effie
fell
asleep
the
next
morning
she
was
awakened
by
a
bell
at
what
seemed
to
her
something
like
the
middle
of
the
night
she
had
to
dress
herself
quickly
and
then
go
into
the
ward
and
begin
her
duties
she
found
somewhat
to
her
surprise
that
she
had
to
begin
her
life
as
a
sort
of
she
had
to
scrub
floors
to
clean
grates
to
polish
handles
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
never
had
a
moment
to
herself
from
morning
till
night
her
feet
felt
very
sore
her
back
ached
once
or
twice
she
felt
so
dreadfully
fagged
that
she
wondered
if
she
could
keep
up
but
through
it
all
growing
greater
and
greater
as
the
days
went
on
there
came
a
sense
of
full
satisfaction
of
something
accomplished
something
done
of
the
feeling
that
she
was
being
trained
thoroughly
and
efficiently
so
that
at
the
end
of
her
time
of
probation
she
might
be
able
to
say
there
one
thing
which
i
can
do
when
the
first
sunday
came
she
was
glad
to
hurry
home
she
went
back
brimful
of
news
and
looked
forward
to
the
quiet
time
in
her
little
parlor
with
great
delight
staunton
was
glad
to
see
her
the
children
were
all
dressed
in
their
black
frocks
and
looked
neat
and
comfortable
george
was
in
the
room
it
seemed
to
effie
as
if
she
did
not
recognize
his
coat
she
wondered
if
it
could
possibly
be
a
new
one
she
arrived
at
home
a
little
before
the
midday
dinner
and
presently
the
landlady
came
in
to
lay
the
cloth
this
used
to
be
agnes
occupation
effie
did
not
say
anything
while
the
woman
was
in
the
room
but
when
she
went
out
she
remarked
on
this
change
oh
it
all
right
said
staunton
i
pay
half
a
crown
a
week
extra
and
the
landlady
now
waits
on
us
it
is
much
more
comfortable
i
assure
you
effie
and
worth
the
extra
bit
of
money
effie
colored
she
gave
agnes
a
reproachful
glance
but
did
not
say
anything
agnes
turned
her
back
with
a
little
sniff
why
effie
she
said
suddenly
how
coarse
your
hands
have
got
what
in
the
world
have
you
been
doing
effie
laughed
polishing
cleaning
and
scrubbing
she
said
in
short
doing
very
much
what
robinson
little
maid
of
does
down
in
the
kitchen
here
oh
dear
dear
exclaimed
agnes
if
those
are
a
nurse
duties
you
wo
catch
me
going
in
for
that
sort
of
profession
it
awfully
interesting
said
effie
i
have
of
course
to
begin
at
the
bottom
but
i
like
it
very
much
while
she
was
speaking
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
george
went
to
open
it
and
a
young
man
came
in
george
brought
him
up
to
introduce
him
to
his
mother
this
is
my
great
friend
fred
lawson
mother
he
said
effie
let
me
introduce
you
to
lawson
lawson
this
is
my
sister
effie
effie
bowed
she
felt
the
color
rushing
all
over
her
face
lawson
was
the
man
whom
george
had
wronged
in
some
mysterious
way
lawson
was
the
man
for
whom
that
dreadful
was
required
chapter
xv
they
all
sat
down
to
dinner
which
effie
further
noticed
was
a
great
deal
more
luxurious
than
when
she
held
the
purse
strings
there
was
a
nice
little
joint
of
roast
beef
yorkshire
pudding
and
one
or
two
vegetables
this
course
was
followed
by
an
apple
tart
and
custard
and
then
the
board
was
graced
with
some
russet
apples
and
walnuts
and
a
bottle
of
port
wine
effie
felt
such
a
sense
of
consternation
that
she
could
scarcely
eat
this
pleasant
food
but
staunton
george
lawson
and
the
younger
children
enjoyed
the
dinner
thoroughly
when
the
beef
was
taken
away
there
was
very
little
left
on
the
joint
and
as
to
the
fruit
tart
it
vanished
almost
as
soon
as
it
was
cut
effie
could
not
help
wondering
to
herself
how
a
year
could
meet
this
lavish
style
of
living
lawson
talked
very
pleasantly
during
dinner
after
glancing
toward
effie
several
times
he
suddenly
remarked
i
can
not
help
feeling
that
i
know
your
face
said
he
where
and
when
have
we
met
before
i
saw
you
last
night
said
effie
with
a
smile
you
saw
me
last
night
what
in
the
world
do
you
mean
yes
said
effie
do
you
remember
no
in
b
ward
you
came
in
to
stop
that
terrible
hemorrhage
from
the
lungs
from
which
she
was
suffering
b
ward
at
st
joseph
exclaimed
lawson
oh
my
dear
effie
now
i
beg
of
you
not
to
allude
to
horrible
things
at
dinner
exclaimed
staunton
no
mother
i
am
sorry
i
mentioned
it
effie
colored
up
what
have
you
to
do
with
st
joseph
said
lawson
i
am
a
probationer
in
b
ward
under
sister
kate
never
how
extraordinary
now
i
remember
you
are
the
girl
who
held
the
basin
so
you
really
are
a
probationer
a
fresh
one
have
you
been
there
long
just
a
week
well
let
me
congratulate
you
on
one
thing
you
held
that
basin
without
shaking
it
i
expect
you
have
got
plenty
of
nerve
of
course
i
knew
i
must
have
seen
you
before
i
never
forget
a
face
lawson
presently
went
out
with
george
for
a
walk
agnes
dressed
the
children
and
took
them
with
her
to
the
sunday
school
and
effie
was
alone
with
her
mother
come
and
sit
by
me
darling
said
staunton
it
is
so
very
nice
to
have
you
home
again
i
miss
you
very
much
my
dear
daughter
but
i
am
really
getting
better
george
wants
me
to
consult
davidson
at
joseph
hospital
he
thinks
that
your
dear
father
may
have
been
mistaken
about
my
heart
and
that
it
may
get
quite
strong
and
well
again
if
you
feel
better
i
do
think
i
would
consult
anyone
said
effie
trembling
a
little
well
dear
well
there
no
hurry
about
it
but
i
always
notice
effie
and
it
distresses
me
not
a
little
that
any
suggestion
of
george
you
are
likely
to
now
surely
that
is
scarcely
fair
to
him
dear
fellow
you
must
notice
my
love
how
cheerful
and
pleasant
we
have
made
this
room
george
insisted
on
my
getting
new
curtains
only
white
muslin
you
careful
child
they
cost
really
very
little
but
they
do
make
such
a
difference
in
the
effect
then
he
has
also
determined
that
i
shall
live
better
plenty
of
meat
and
a
little
port
wine
it
is
a
most
economy
my
dear
not
to
attend
to
one
diet
nothing
else
keeps
up
the
health
yes
mother
i
know
all
that
but
good
expensive
nourishing
things
have
to
be
paid
for
now
effie
do
let
me
hear
you
begin
that
dismal
plaint
do
you
really
mean
to
insinuate
that
i
your
mother
would
go
into
debt
for
things
oh
no
dear
mother
how
could
i
think
that
you
imply
it
my
love
by
your
manner
effie
sighed
it
was
hopeless
to
argue
or
remonstrate
she
felt
as
if
the
little
home
so
different
from
the
beloved
one
in
whittington
was
in
reality
constructed
over
a
volcano
any
day
it
might
collapse
the
weight
of
sorrow
which
pressed
against
her
heart
as
she
thought
of
this
of
her
father
of
the
old
life
quite
crushed
the
brave
spirit
for
the
moment
where
was
george
honor
how
dared
he
lead
his
mother
into
these
extravagances
when
he
knew
too
when
he
knew
effie
clasped
her
hands
tightly
together
she
restrained
her
emotions
with
an
effort
and
turned
the
conversation
to
indifferent
matters
staunton
was
certainly
in
better
spirits
there
was
a
little
color
in
her
cheeks
and
some
of
the
old
sweet
brightness
in
her
eves
when
george
had
been
absent
about
an
hour
she
grew
restless
and
she
left
her
seat
by
effie
side
and
going
to
the
window
looked
up
and
down
the
street
i
hope
the
rain
is
coming
on
she
said
he
forgot
to
take
an
overcoat
who
mother
george
but
really
mother
dear
he
is
sugar
he
wo
melt
there
you
are
again
effie
making
little
of
your
brother
it
so
happens
that
he
has
a
nice
new
coat
on
and
i
do
want
it
to
get
shabby
at
once
a
new
coat
how
did
he
buy
it
i
lent
him
a
little
money
for
the
purpose
he
did
go
into
debt
so
you
need
not
think
it
i
wonder
you
were
able
to
spare
the
money
oh
yes
some
of
my
dividends
fell
due
and
were
paid
on
monday
i
lent
george
three
pounds
i
think
he
has
got
a
wonderful
coat
for
the
money
he
will
pay
me
back
as
soon
as
he
gets
his
own
salary
ah
and
there
he
is
dear
fellow
and
that
young
man
lawson
effie
now
do
ring
the
bell
robinson
ought
to
have
tea
on
the
table
with
a
great
effort
effie
kept
from
making
remarks
which
she
knew
would
only
irritate
her
mother
she
said
to
herself
there
no
help
for
things
the
person
to
talk
to
is
george
he
ought
not
to
allow
mother
to
rush
through
her
money
in
this
way
i
wonder
if
i
am
doing
wrong
in
giving
up
my
to
the
hospital
but
no
i
do
think
i
am
mother
would
have
insisted
on
managing
the
money
in
any
case
robinson
appeared
with
the
there
was
a
little
jug
of
cream
and
a
shilling
madeira
cake
there
was
also
a
great
plate
of
thick
bread
and
butter
for
the
children
the
was
placed
on
the
table
and
george
and
lawson
took
their
tea
standing
effie
helped
them
lawson
looked
at
her
once
or
twice
and
thought
what
a
wonderfully
nice
face
she
had
how
true
her
eyes
were
how
good
she
seemed
altogether
she
altogether
of
different
metal
from
her
brother
thought
the
young
man
i
wish
with
all
my
heart
he
were
like
her
but
although
there
is
something
lovable
about
him
and
we
are
chums
of
course
yet
i
never
feel
quite
sure
of
myself
when
in
his
company
the
meal
which
followed
was
quite
merry
phil
and
marjory
had
gone
up
to
the
top
of
their
class
in
sunday
school
agnes
was
promoted
to
teach
a
class
of
very
little
children
katie
was
going
in
for
the
junior
cambridge
examination
and
eagerly
consulted
effie
about
some
books
which
she
was
obliged
to
procure
effie
promised
to
give
her
the
money
out
of
her
first
month
salary
but
that
will
be
some
time
off
she
said
for
i
am
only
going
through
my
month
trial
now
so
you
must
be
patient
katie
i
lend
you
the
money
said
george
stroking
his
sister
hair
he
looked
so
affectionate
and
handsome
and
so
manly
and
that
it
was
impossible
not
to
feel
pleased
with
him
eyes
quite
beamed
as
she
glanced
at
her
eldest
son
now
mother
i
am
going
to
sit
near
you
he
said
he
drew
his
chair
close
to
his
mother
and
began
to
talk
to
her
in
a
low
tone
effie
and
lawson
exchanged
a
few
words
over
hospital
work
he
would
make
an
enthusiastic
doctor
some
day
he
loved
the
profession
and
thought
it
the
noblest
in
the
world
he
reminded
effie
a
little
of
her
father
the
quick
hours
flew
all
too
fast
effie
time
was
up
she
went
back
to
the
hospital
with
a
curious
sense
of
uneasiness
but
equally
also
of
rest
and
refreshment
it
was
nice
to
think
that
george
had
such
a
good
friend
as
fred
lawson
chapter
xvi
two
months
passed
away
without
any
special
incident
effie
month
of
trial
being
over
she
was
now
established
at
joseph
as
a
regular
probationer
her
salary
of
twelve
pounds
a
year
began
from
the
day
her
second
month
commenced
all
those
qualities
which
dorothy
was
quite
sure
that
effie
possessed
were
coming
abundantly
to
the
fore
she
had
tact
she
had
courage
she
had
nerve
she
was
also
absolutely
unselfish
self
was
not
in
the
foreground
with
her
the
work
which
she
had
to
do
the
work
which
she
meant
to
carry
through
in
the
best
possible
manner
in
the
bravest
spirit
with
the
most
conscientious
sense
of
duty
ever
filled
her
mental
horizon
sister
kate
began
to
trust
effie
she
began
to
smile
at
her
now
and
then
and
to
give
her
not
quite
so
much
and
and
a
little
more
work
to
do
for
the
patients
themselves
the
patients
liked
to
call
effie
to
smooth
their
sheets
to
turn
their
pillows
to
give
them
their
drinks
one
or
two
of
them
when
they
had
an
odd
moment
began
to
make
little
confidences
to
her
she
learned
their
histories
almost
at
a
glance
she
also
studied
their
fancies
she
began
to
find
out
the
exact
way
robinson
liked
her
gruel
flavored
and
how
guiers
liked
her
pillows
arranged
effie
made
no
fuss
over
the
patients
fuss
and
favoritism
were
strongly
against
the
rules
but
notwithstanding
she
was
a
favorite
herself
more
than
one
pair
of
tired
eyes
looked
at
her
with
longing
and
refreshment
as
she
passed
and
more
than
one
pair
of
wearied
lips
smiled
when
she
came
near
two
months
went
by
in
this
fashion
very
very
quickly
as
such
busy
months
must
it
was
found
impossible
to
allow
effie
to
go
home
every
sunday
but
she
went
as
a
rule
every
second
one
things
seemed
to
be
going
fairly
straight
at
home
the
extravagance
she
had
noticed
on
her
first
sunday
was
not
repeated
to
the
same
extent
staunton
seemed
decidedly
better
and
effie
gave
herself
up
with
a
thankful
heart
to
her
work
it
was
now
the
middle
of
winter
close
upon
the
weather
outside
was
bitterly
cold
although
in
the
ward
effie
scarcely
felt
this
she
wore
her
neat
lilac
print
dress
just
the
same
in
winter
as
in
summer
one
day
about
a
week
before
christmas
when
a
thick
yellow
fog
was
shutting
out
all
the
view
from
the
high
ward
windows
effie
was
doing
something
for
no
a
poor
woman
of
the
name
of
martin
when
lawson
the
young
medical
student
came
suddenly
into
the
ward
he
had
been
sent
by
the
house
physician
to
take
notes
on
a
certain
case
this
case
happened
to
be
the
very
one
which
effie
was
attending
when
he
saw
effie
a
peculiar
expression
passed
over
his
face
it
was
against
the
strictest
of
all
rules
for
the
medical
students
ever
to
address
a
word
to
the
probationers
even
the
necessary
duties
required
of
them
had
to
be
conveyed
through
a
sister
or
a
ward
nurse
effie
was
helping
poor
no
to
drink
a
little
milk
and
soda
water
as
she
put
the
glass
back
in
its
place
lawson
came
close
to
her
he
said
abruptly
i
am
very
anxious
to
have
a
conversation
with
you
about
george
she
colored
crimson
when
he
addressed
her
yes
she
said
nurse
exclaimed
sister
kate
voice
at
that
moment
in
a
harsh
sharp
tone
go
at
once
and
make
up
the
fire
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
effie
went
off
trembling
and
disturbed
the
fact
of
lawson
having
specially
addressed
her
passed
out
of
her
mind
immediately
but
the
mention
of
george
name
filled
her
with
fear
it
was
the
first
time
in
her
hospital
life
that
she
absolutely
forgot
the
rules
laid
down
for
her
conduct
sister
kate
who
had
the
eyes
of
a
hawk
noticed
when
lawson
bent
over
to
speak
to
the
pretty
little
probationer
it
was
her
duty
to
correct
the
faintest
attempt
at
flirting
on
the
part
of
the
probationers
and
medical
students
she
felt
shocked
at
effie
who
was
fast
becoming
a
favorite
of
hers
permitting
such
a
thing
for
a
moment
and
when
next
effie
had
anything
to
do
for
her
quite
resumed
her
icy
manner
toward
her
no
required
some
special
attention
again
that
evening
she
was
feverish
and
not
going
on
well
she
called
effie
to
her
side
in
an
eager
voice
you
might
turn
my
pillow
again
for
me
dear
she
said
you
know
how
to
hitch
it
right
under
the
small
of
my
back
better
than
any
of
those
other
nurses
there
now
that
better
stoop
your
head
a
bit
love
i
believe
if
you
go
downstairs
into
the
hall
near
the
surgery
you
are
safe
to
see
that
young
doctor
he
is
sure
to
be
in
the
dispensary
about
this
time
and
you
might
catch
him
when
he
is
going
out
hush
said
effie
i
know
you
mean
kindly
but
you
ought
not
to
talk
like
that
oh
my
love
i
know
i
know
said
the
woman
with
a
wink
we
was
all
young
once
i
am
and
have
never
had
a
mate
i
missed
my
chance
when
i
was
young
do
you
miss
yours
nurse
effie
turned
pale
with
indignation
but
then
seeing
that
the
woman
meant
kindly
she
tried
to
smile
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
she
said
but
things
are
a
bit
the
way
you
think
she
then
went
off
to
perform
her
other
duties
sister
kate
spoke
to
her
sharply
nurse
she
said
i
hope
you
remember
the
rule
which
forbids
favoritism
i
noticed
that
you
stayed
longer
than
was
necessary
with
no
she
complained
a
good
deal
of
her
back
sister
and
i
was
arranging
her
pillows
for
her
do
try
to
deceive
me
said
sister
kate
you
know
perfectly
well
that
you
did
not
spend
all
that
time
arranging
a
pillow
now
go
and
help
to
bring
up
the
teas
effie
turned
to
her
duties
with
a
tingling
sensation
in
her
eyes
it
was
the
first
time
since
her
arrival
at
joseph
that
her
work
seemed
almost
impossible
to
her
her
heart
quite
ached
with
longing
to
know
what
lawson
had
meant
what
had
he
to
tell
her
about
george
as
she
thought
her
fears
grew
greater
and
her
memory
of
the
hospital
rules
less
and
less
she
determined
at
any
risk
to
try
and
see
lawson
that
evening
it
would
be
impossible
for
her
to
venture
down
into
the
central
hall
of
the
hospital
but
she
knew
for
certain
that
he
would
come
into
the
ward
again
late
that
evening
sister
kate
would
be
off
duty
at
nine
and
sister
alice
the
night
superintendent
was
not
nearly
so
strict
effie
hovered
about
near
the
door
she
knew
she
was
disobeying
rules
for
she
ought
to
have
gone
to
bed
soon
after
nine
no
one
noticed
her
however
the
night
nurses
were
all
busy
taking
up
their
different
duties
and
sister
alice
was
talking
to
the
house
physician
at
the
farther
end
of
the
ward
suddenly
effie
standing
near
one
of
the
doors
saw
lawson
coming
upstairs
she
ran
to
him
without
a
moment
hesitation
what
have
you
to
tell
me
about
george
she
said
he
colored
and
looked
almost
annoyed
when
she
spoke
to
him
i
can
not
tell
you
here
he
said
in
a
hasty
voice
are
you
going
home
next
sunday
no
it
my
sunday
in
unless
i
could
get
one
of
the
other
probationers
to
change
with
me
i
wish
you
would
manage
to
do
that
i
really
want
to
see
you
very
badly
if
you
go
home
on
sunday
i
call
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
and
then
i
can
walk
back
with
you
to
the
hospital
now
go
at
once
you
must
not
be
seen
talking
to
me
effie
flew
down
the
corridor
to
her
own
little
room
that
night
she
could
scarcely
sleep
she
felt
oppressed
with
all
kinds
of
forebodings
the
idea
of
her
having
broken
one
of
the
rules
and
in
fact
laid
herself
open
to
dismissal
never
once
entered
into
her
head
she
was
still
the
faithful
nurse
the
gentle
good
girl
who
would
give
up
her
whole
life
to
the
alleviation
of
the
sufferings
of
others
the
fact
of
effie
having
a
dual
life
of
having
a
nature
which
could
not
forget
the
old
home
ties
was
not
likely
however
to
be
recognized
in
the
hospital
the
next
morning
at
breakfast
she
noticed
that
one
or
two
of
the
probationers
giggled
a
little
when
they
saw
her
she
sat
down
in
her
usual
seat
and
one
of
the
girls
nudged
her
elbow
well
she
said
you
no
better
than
the
rest
of
us
what
in
the
world
do
you
mean
said
effie
coloring
scarlet
oh
do
be
so
sly
said
the
girl
with
a
poke
which
she
intended
to
make
playful
he
is
a
very
young
fellow
too
only
if
you
do
want
to
get
into
mischief
do
let
sister
kate
see
it
i
know
what
you
mean
said
effie
in
a
steady
voice
but
you
are
altogether
mistaken
i
scarcely
know
lawson
he
only
spoke
to
me
yesterday
because
he
happened
to
be
a
great
friend
of
my
brother
oh
the
usual
thing
laughed
the
girl
it
so
very
convenient
to
have
brothers
is
it
not
lucy
the
girl
addressed
as
lucy
grinned
and
effie
felt
very
uncomfortable
at
dinner
that
day
it
suddenly
passed
through
her
mind
that
she
must
by
hook
or
by
crook
induce
one
of
the
probationers
to
change
sundays
with
her
lucy
was
usually
a
girl
her
people
did
not
live
in
town
as
a
rule
she
spent
her
sundays
out
with
her
effie
went
up
to
her
when
she
had
a
moment
to
spare
lucy
she
said
i
wish
you
would
do
something
for
me
to
be
sure
i
will
effie
she
replied
anything
in
my
power
i
want
to
go
home
very
badly
next
sunday
do
you
think
it
would
be
possible
for
me
to
change
with
you
said
lucy
you
want
to
meet
lawson
i
know
your
sly
little
ways
no
indeed
it
is
not
true
began
effie
but
then
she
stopped
for
she
knew
it
was
true
she
would
meet
him
oh
how
little
lucy
knows
the
burden
that
is
pressing
on
me
thought
the
poor
girl
tears
suddenly
rose
to
her
pretty
brown
eyes
i
can
not
explain
things
to
you
she
said
i
would
if
i
could
you
must
believe
in
me
and
trust
me
i
have
a
great
deal
of
anxiety
oh
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
hospital
it
is
about
my
home
life
there
is
a
great
burden
laid
upon
me
i
want
very
much
to
go
home
on
sunday
indeed
lawson
has
little
to
do
with
the
real
burden
only
i
believe
he
can
tell
me
something
i
know
you
are
a
good
girl
began
lucy
who
became
grave
on
the
spot
of
course
you
shall
take
my
turn
if
sister
kate
will
allow
it
chapter
xvii
sister
kate
made
no
objection
and
effie
hurried
home
in
a
state
of
excitement
which
she
could
scarcely
restrain
staunton
did
not
expect
her
and
the
poor
girl
felt
her
heart
sink
low
in
her
breast
when
she
saw
that
her
unexpected
arrival
scarcely
gave
satisfaction
there
was
a
nice
white
cloth
on
the
table
and
a
large
bunch
of
flowers
in
a
pretty
jug
stood
in
the
center
an
attempt
at
dessert
again
graced
the
board
and
effie
noticed
that
a
bottle
of
sherry
and
a
bottle
of
port
stood
on
the
little
sideboard
she
felt
a
sense
of
dismay
even
mother
is
beginning
to
keep
things
from
me
she
said
to
herself
it
is
all
george
of
course
they
did
not
expect
me
home
so
they
are
having
a
particularly
good
dinner
is
it
possible
that
even
mother
would
try
to
deceive
me
oh
dear
dear
how
changed
all
our
life
is
now
that
father
is
no
longer
here
there
had
never
been
the
faintest
shadow
of
concealment
about
the
honest
doctor
and
while
with
her
husband
staunton
was
the
most
straightforward
woman
imaginable
but
alas
her
character
was
a
weak
one
she
was
now
completely
under
george
influence
and
george
had
learned
to
walk
in
those
crooked
paths
which
those
who
begin
to
do
wrong
are
always
tempted
to
follow
he
came
in
presently
looking
particularly
handsome
and
manly
he
had
on
a
nice
new
coat
and
his
beautifully
collar
showed
off
his
fresh
young
face
to
the
best
possible
advantage
staunton
called
him
up
at
once
for
effie
to
criticise
does
he
look
well
in
a
white
silk
tie
she
said
i
like
white
ties
better
than
colored
ones
for
him
and
they
are
not
so
expensive
either
for
i
can
wash
them
myself
i
wonder
all
that
washing
does
not
fag
you
mother
said
effie
before
staunton
could
reply
robinson
appeared
with
the
dinner
and
the
family
sat
down
to
an
excellent
meal
effie
saw
quite
plainly
that
it
would
be
useless
for
her
to
attempt
to
expostulate
staunton
after
her
first
start
of
unconcealed
dismay
was
very
affectionate
to
her
daughter
she
told
effie
that
she
thought
she
looked
a
little
pale
and
wondered
whether
all
that
nursing
was
not
too
much
for
her
no
mother
i
love
the
work
said
effie
but
that
is
not
the
question
my
love
said
staunton
shaking
her
head
the
question
is
this
is
it
undermining
your
health
well
in
any
case
i
should
have
to
earn
my
living
said
effie
i
could
not
possibly
afford
to
do
nothing
at
home
as
well
earn
it
as
a
nurse
as
in
any
other
way
and
i
love
nursing
beyond
anything
else
in
the
world
you
always
were
an
obstinate
dear
little
girl
was
she
not
george
but
after
all
effie
here
staunton
paused
and
looked
at
her
son
i
think
i
might
tell
effie
she
said
giving
him
a
bright
nod
oh
i
do
suppose
there
is
anything
to
make
a
fuss
over
replied
george
he
colored
as
he
spoke
and
looked
out
of
the
window
he
could
easily
hoodwink
his
mother
but
it
was
difficult
to
meet
effie
clear
eyes
and
not
to
feel
sure
that
she
was
reading
him
through
and
seeing
him
as
he
really
was
agnes
jumped
up
saying
it
was
full
time
to
go
to
sunday
school
she
carried
off
the
children
with
her
and
george
his
mother
and
effie
were
alone
sit
down
in
your
usual
chair
george
said
his
mother
he
did
so
bringing
up
the
port
wine
as
he
spoke
and
pouring
out
a
glass
which
he
insisted
on
his
mother
drinking
he
tossed
off
one
or
two
glasses
himself
after
which
his
eyes
grew
bright
and
steady
and
a
color
came
into
his
cheeks
yes
tell
effie
he
said
i
think
you
might
do
so
george
i
am
so
proud
of
you
no
mother
i
like
to
hear
you
describing
me
you
make
me
feel
such
an
awfully
fine
fellow
george
laughed
as
he
spoke
well
then
effie
said
his
mother
you
will
in
future
learn
to
appreciate
our
dear
george
as
he
deserves
the
fact
is
this
he
has
just
got
a
rise
in
his
salary
of
a
whole
hundred
a
year
george
is
now
earning
two
hundred
a
year
and
he
has
arranged
dear
fellow
to
give
me
one
hundred
a
year
in
order
that
i
may
have
those
little
comforts
which
he
thinks
i
require
is
that
really
true
said
effie
coloring
oh
what
splendid
news
she
looked
eagerly
at
george
as
she
spoke
she
longed
to
jump
up
throw
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
kiss
him
is
this
true
she
repeated
oh
i
am
so
glad
we
do
want
the
money
so
badly
george
stooped
to
flick
off
a
speck
of
dust
which
had
settled
on
his
immaculate
his
eyes
would
not
meet
effie
of
course
it
is
true
he
said
in
a
bravado
sort
of
voice
you
suppose
i
would
tell
mother
a
lie
do
you
oh
effie
how
could
you
doubt
him
said
staunton
almost
crying
no
mother
i
do
doubt
him
effie
replied
she
walked
to
the
window
her
momentary
pleasure
was
over
she
knew
just
as
well
as
if
george
had
told
her
that
the
whole
thing
was
a
fabrication
if
he
had
more
money
he
was
not
getting
it
in
his
situation
his
look
his
attitude
joined
to
the
few
words
lawson
had
said
to
her
made
effie
quite
certain
on
that
point
burning
words
half
rose
to
her
lips
but
she
checked
them
she
did
not
doubt
george
she
read
the
truth
in
his
eyes
what
fell
from
his
lips
was
nothing
staunton
kept
on
talking
we
shall
have
real
comforts
at
home
now
she
said
i
am
as
my
boy
says
a
wonderful
manager
the
best
in
all
the
world
interrupted
george
there
never
was
such
a
mother
staunton
eyes
quite
shone
with
pleasure
what
i
was
thinking
was
this
effie
she
continued
that
if
you
really
are
not
strong
enough
to
go
on
with
your
work
we
can
now
afford
to
keep
you
at
home
of
course
we
can
said
george
he
had
scarcely
said
these
words
half
turning
his
back
on
effie
as
he
spoke
when
the
room
door
was
opened
by
robinson
and
lawson
was
announced
when
he
saw
his
friend
george
suddenly
turned
pale
he
recovered
himself
in
a
moment
however
and
went
forward
to
meet
him
speaking
in
a
loud
and
bragging
voice
is
that
you
lawson
welcome
old
chap
we
did
not
expect
you
but
we
are
right
glad
to
see
you
of
course
you
will
stay
and
have
tea
with
us
wo
you
mr
lawson
said
staunton
in
her
sweet
voice
yes
certainly
said
lawson
he
had
given
effie
his
hand
when
he
came
into
the
room
but
he
scarcely
looked
at
her
he
sat
down
near
staunton
and
began
to
talk
to
her
in
his
usual
bright
way
she
yielded
after
a
moment
to
his
charm
lawson
was
a
young
fellow
with
a
great
amount
of
general
information
he
had
also
abundance
of
tact
and
he
knew
how
to
suit
his
words
to
requirements
when
george
saw
his
friend
talking
to
his
mother
he
went
up
to
effie
and
stood
near
her
come
to
this
end
of
the
room
he
said
abruptly
effie
followed
him
i
am
likely
to
make
quite
a
pile
of
money
he
said
speaking
in
a
low
voice
and
glancing
toward
his
mother
i
know
you
think
badly
of
me
it
awfully
hard
on
a
fellow
when
his
sister
thinks
badly
of
him
but
nevertheless
i
am
likely
to
be
in
a
real
good
way
of
business
soon
and
what
i
want
to
say
now
is
this
effie
i
am
anxious
to
pay
back
that
which
you
borrowed
for
me
i
wish
you
would
said
effie
well
i
dare
say
i
can
give
you
fifty
pounds
toward
it
this
week
squire
harvey
wo
require
the
whole
of
the
money
back
at
once
oh
he
does
require
it
at
all
said
effie
it
is
i
who
require
it
it
is
my
honor
and
the
honor
of
my
dead
father
that
demands
it
it
ought
to
be
paid
back
and
you
ought
to
do
it
do
speak
so
loudly
you
do
get
so
excited
about
things
said
george
effie
lowered
her
voice
lawson
as
he
talked
to
staunton
glanced
sharply
at
her
tea
was
brought
in
and
effie
had
to
take
her
place
at
the
george
words
had
made
her
feel
more
uncomfortable
than
ever
it
was
absolute
nonsense
to
suppose
that
he
could
be
earning
money
at
this
rate
after
tea
effie
had
to
go
back
to
the
hospital
mother
she
said
i
wo
see
you
now
for
a
fortnight
staunton
got
up
and
put
her
feeble
old
arms
round
her
neck
my
darling
she
said
take
care
of
yourself
overwork
yourself
remember
it
is
unnecessary
you
have
got
a
home
and
a
dear
noble
faithful
brother
to
provide
for
you
yes
effie
you
are
heartily
welcome
to
all
that
i
can
give
you
said
george
in
a
lofty
tone
effie
pressed
her
lips
to
her
mother
kept
her
arms
for
one
moment
round
her
neck
and
then
turned
away
with
tears
in
her
eyes
george
she
said
holding
out
her
hand
i
see
you
back
to
the
hospital
said
george
do
do
that
it
is
a
beautiful
evening
mother
would
like
you
to
take
a
walk
with
her
and
i
have
the
greatest
pleasure
in
seeing
miss
effie
home
if
she
would
let
me
said
lawson
george
hesitated
for
a
moment
for
some
reason
which
was
more
than
evident
he
did
not
want
effie
to
be
alone
with
his
friend
he
looked
at
his
mother
she
did
not
catch
his
eye
or
she
would
have
read
his
wish
by
instinct
the
evening
was
really
very
fine
and
she
liked
to
walk
round
the
square
leaning
on
george
arm
when
well
enough
too
she
liked
him
to
take
her
to
church
i
think
i
enjoy
a
little
walk
with
you
george
she
said
the
evening
is
quite
like
spring
wonderful
weather
for
so
near
christmas
the
air
is
as
mild
and
soft
as
milk
and
as
lawson
has
so
kindly
promised
to
see
effie
back
perhaps
you
come
all
right
said
george
effie
you
hear
from
me
perhaps
in
the
course
of
the
week
effie
went
downstairs
followed
by
lawson
as
soon
as
ever
they
got
out
he
looked
her
full
in
the
face
you
must
be
greatly
amazed
he
said
at
my
presuming
to
bother
you
about
your
family
affairs
oh
no
she
replied
i
think
you
are
kind
but
your
words
have
made
me
very
anxious
then
said
lawson
you
see
for
yourself
that
things
are
not
all
right
i
have
known
that
for
some
time
george
is
a
great
friend
of
mine
continued
lawson
we
saw
a
good
deal
of
each
other
when
he
first
came
to
town
he
was
a
right
jolly
sort
of
fellow
then
it
was
only
about
six
months
ago
that
all
of
a
sudden
he
seemed
to
change
i
suppose
he
took
up
with
some
bad
companions
but
i
really
ca
say
for
certain
but
what
about
him
now
said
effie
in
a
voice
almost
irritable
with
anxiety
have
you
anything
fresh
to
tell
me
you
heard
him
probably
say
to
your
mother
that
he
had
a
rise
of
salary
yes
the
fact
is
continued
lawson
i
know
that
not
to
be
true
effie
also
in
her
heart
of
hearts
knew
it
not
to
be
true
but
she
could
not
bear
to
hear
a
stranger
abuse
her
brother
how
can
you
be
sure
she
said
somewhat
inconsistently
how
can
i
be
sure
he
retorted
this
is
not
a
matter
of
sentiment
i
happen
to
know
george
is
working
with
a
relative
it
is
true
but
gering
is
one
of
the
hardest
men
in
the
city
everyone
who
understands
him
knows
the
system
on
which
he
works
and
a
relative
has
no
more
chance
with
him
than
another
george
will
have
to
take
his
rise
step
by
step
at
something
like
the
rate
of
ten
pounds
a
year
perhaps
he
has
told
your
mother
that
he
has
had
quite
a
large
rise
he
said
a
hundred
a
year
he
said
he
was
now
receiving
two
hundred
a
year
what
is
to
be
done
said
lawson
something
ought
to
be
done
to
stop
it
your
mother
will
certainly
live
beyond
her
means
and
then
you
will
all
get
into
no
end
of
a
mess
do
forgive
me
for
taking
an
interest
the
fact
is
george
was
a
great
friend
of
mine
once
oh
please
do
give
him
up
said
effie
if
good
men
turn
against
him
what
chance
has
he
poor
fellow
i
wo
if
you
wish
me
to
look
after
him
said
lawson
giving
her
a
quick
glance
at
this
moment
two
nurses
from
joseph
hospital
who
were
crossing
the
street
saw
effie
they
noticed
her
earnest
face
the
sparkle
in
her
eyes
they
also
observed
the
glance
which
the
handsome
young
medical
student
gave
her
the
women
nudged
one
another
smiled
and
went
on
effie
never
saw
them
let
us
walk
a
little
faster
said
lawson
who
was
not
so
unobservant
he
felt
vexed
that
the
women
should
see
him
with
effie
but
now
that
he
was
with
her
he
must
at
least
unburden
his
mind
george
told
me
said
effie
perhaps
it
is
not
wrong
to
repeat
it
to
you
that
he
is
likely
to
make
a
great
deal
of
money
did
he
did
he
tell
you
that
did
he
happen
to
say
how
much
well
he
spoke
as
if
money
were
very
easily
earned
said
effie
he
said
something
about
getting
fifty
pounds
this
week
i
must
tell
you
the
truth
said
lawson
there
no
help
for
it
your
brother
will
go
straight
to
the
bad
if
he
is
not
rescued
and
that
at
once
what
do
you
mean
oh
how
you
frighten
me
effie
face
was
as
white
as
a
sheet
i
am
ever
so
sorry
said
lawson
but
what
is
the
use
of
keeping
back
the
truth
george
has
had
no
rise
of
salary
indeed
if
he
is
not
careful
he
is
mother
has
gone
far
beyond
our
means
she
transcriber
note
text
of
this
paragraph
in
original
is
as
shown
and
ends
abruptly
at
this
point
then
how
does
he
get
his
money
he
gets
it
by
gambling
gambling
oh
no
oh
no
said
effie
she
had
the
horror
of
that
vice
which
a
girl
must
ever
have
it
is
true
said
lawson
it
gives
me
the
greatest
pain
to
tell
you
anything
so
bad
of
your
brother
but
there
no
help
for
it
but
how
do
you
know
interrupted
effie
i
know
by
the
best
of
evidence
i
have
had
my
suspicions
for
some
time
but
i
happened
to
see
him
coming
out
of
one
of
those
places
last
week
yes
i
must
tell
you
i
saw
him
coming
out
of
a
gambling
den
i
think
he
goes
night
after
night
at
present
he
is
winning
more
than
he
loses
but
that
is
always
the
game
for
drawing
fellows
on
it
must
be
stopped
said
effie
she
felt
quite
faint
and
sick
if
her
mother
knew
this
it
would
kill
her
on
the
spot
they
had
nearly
reached
the
hospital
and
effie
turned
and
faced
lawson
you
do
half
know
what
this
means
to
me
she
said
george
is
not
exactly
like
an
ordinary
brother
when
my
father
died
quite
suddenly
of
diphtheria
some
months
ago
he
left
my
mother
in
george
care
if
george
goes
to
the
bad
now
she
will
certainly
die
you
must
have
noticed
for
yourself
how
she
is
wrapped
up
in
him
yes
no
one
could
fail
to
notice
it
i
think
her
love
for
him
beautiful
and
he
loves
her
too
poor
fellow
that
is
his
great
redeeming
point
oh
i
do
call
it
real
love
said
effie
almost
with
passion
to
deceive
her
as
he
does
to
do
wrong
and
that
sort
of
wrong
oh
i
think
my
heart
will
break
tears
choked
her
voice
she
had
the
greatest
possible
difficulty
in
keeping
them
back
lawson
took
out
his
watch
you
are
not
late
he
said
let
us
take
a
turn
round
this
square
they
had
entered
an
square
where
there
were
very
few
people
they
walked
round
and
round
the
dismal
central
garden
for
some
time
lawson
talked
and
effie
listened
after
a
time
they
decided
that
george
perilous
downward
career
must
be
stopped
at
any
cost
lawson
said
he
would
make
it
his
business
to
see
george
the
following
evening
to
tell
him
quite
frankly
what
he
knew
and
in
short
to
compel
him
if
necessary
to
do
what
was
right
he
be
obstinate
said
effie
i
know
he
be
hard
to
deal
with
oh
what
shall
we
do
what
shall
we
do
i
am
quite
certain
that
already
my
mother
has
gone
far
beyond
our
means
she
has
been
half
careful
enough
since
i
left
her
if
george
stops
getting
money
in
this
way
she
wonder
and
question
i
doubt
very
much
whether
you
can
have
the
least
influence
over
him
what
is
to
be
done
do
be
so
said
lawson
he
requires
a
man
to
tackle
him
a
man
who
really
knows
the
temptations
young
fellows
meet
if
you
allow
me
to
say
so
miss
staunton
i
do
think
the
case
quite
hopeless
anyhow
you
may
be
quite
sure
i
do
my
best
for
him
thank
you
said
poor
effie
you
are
more
than
good
and
i
do
trust
you
she
hurried
back
to
the
hospital
but
to
her
dismay
when
she
got
there
found
that
she
was
a
quarter
of
an
hour
late
absolute
punctuality
in
returning
from
any
outdoor
pleasure
is
expected
from
all
nurses
she
hurried
upstairs
hoping
that
she
might
gain
her
room
put
on
her
cap
and
apron
and
return
to
the
ward
before
sister
kate
had
time
to
miss
her
this
might
have
been
the
case
for
sister
kate
had
been
very
much
occupied
with
some
anxious
cases
during
the
afternoon
had
not
one
of
the
nurses
who
had
a
spite
against
effie
for
being
prettier
and
cleverer
than
herself
drawn
sister
kate
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
young
probationer
was
behind
her
time
this
nurse
had
seen
effie
walking
with
lawson
immediately
her
spirit
of
jealousy
and
envy
was
up
in
arms
she
did
not
for
a
moment
consider
what
injury
she
might
do
the
poor
girl
by
her
false
and
unkind
words
nurse
staunton
is
late
she
said
i
do
know
how
i
am
possibly
to
get
the
ward
in
order
for
the
night
unless
i
have
some
help
i
must
speak
to
her
said
sister
kate
glancing
at
the
clock
and
looking
a
little
annoyed
this
was
her
sunday
to
go
out
either
i
can
not
let
the
rules
be
broken
in
this
way
let
me
know
as
soon
as
ever
she
comes
in
i
suppose
there
some
excuse
to
be
made
for
her
said
the
nurse
speaking
in
a
knowing
way
she
a
very
careful
good
sort
of
girl
but
there
times
when
the
best
of
us
forget
ourselves
the
woman
knew
that
sister
kate
would
interpret
her
words
as
she
wished
her
to
do
she
went
off
in
a
hurry
to
perform
her
duties
and
when
effie
entered
the
ward
sister
kate
received
her
with
marked
coldness
you
are
very
late
nurse
she
said
where
have
you
been
i
have
been
at
home
with
my
mother
was
your
mother
ill
is
that
your
excuse
for
being
behind
your
time
no
mother
was
well
better
than
she
has
been
for
some
time
then
why
are
you
late
the
fact
is
i
was
walking
with
a
friend
and
forgot
to
notice
the
hour
that
no
excuse
you
have
certainly
behaved
very
carelessly
and
have
put
the
other
nurses
out
by
not
being
in
time
to
take
your
duties
who
was
the
friend
with
whom
you
were
walking
sister
kate
had
no
right
to
ask
this
question
but
she
felt
much
provoked
at
the
moment
and
the
color
which
rushed
all
over
effie
face
excited
her
curiosity
perhaps
you
think
i
did
wrong
said
effie
looking
up
at
her
almost
defiantly
the
friend
was
lawson
he
knows
my
brother
very
well
he
was
talking
to
me
about
him
i
can
not
refuse
to
speak
to
him
when
i
see
him
out
of
doors
can
i
do
be
pert
nurse
you
know
it
is
one
of
the
strictest
rules
of
the
hospital
that
none
of
the
nurses
are
to
speak
to
the
medical
students
i
know
and
i
do
wish
to
speak
to
him
in
the
hospital
see
you
do
or
you
be
dismissed
at
once
in
fact
the
less
you
know
of
any
of
the
medical
students
the
better
for
you
i
am
very
sorry
that
this
young
man
knows
your
brother
i
should
not
have
had
anything
to
do
with
you
had
i
been
aware
of
this
fact
how
absurd
and
unjust
murmured
effie
under
her
breath
she
turned
away
she
felt
absolutely
cross
sister
kate
called
her
back
now
bustle
about
she
said
the
want
to
be
taken
away
the
women
are
perfectly
tired
of
waiting
to
be
settled
for
the
night
effie
moved
mechanically
about
her
duties
her
heart
felt
sick
she
did
not
think
she
could
remain
much
longer
under
sister
kate
care
if
she
treats
me
like
this
thought
the
proud
girl
i
can
not
endure
it
lawson
is
nothing
to
me
he
is
only
my
brother
friend
he
is
good
and
wants
to
help
us
in
an
hour
of
great
perplexity
what
shall
i
do
i
feel
tied
and
fettered
in
every
way
she
laid
her
head
on
her
pillow
only
to
burst
into
tears
she
cried
herself
to
sleep
all
the
world
seemed
black
to
her
chapter
xviii
effie
saw
very
little
of
dorothy
fraser
but
on
the
following
day
to
her
great
surprise
and
pleasure
as
she
was
leaving
the
dorothy
came
up
and
spoke
to
her
you
have
a
minute
to
spare
she
said
just
come
out
on
this
balcony
and
talk
to
me
effie
obeyed
her
what
do
you
want
with
me
dorothy
she
asked
i
wish
to
know
why
you
look
so
pale
and
worried
you
seem
to
have
displeased
sister
kate
too
effie
very
nearly
burst
into
tears
but
she
restrained
herself
i
tell
you
what
it
is
she
said
it
is
the
most
unjust
thing
she
then
mentioned
in
as
few
words
as
possible
the
circumstance
of
lawson
having
spoken
to
her
of
her
great
anxiety
about
george
and
of
her
having
walked
back
with
the
young
medical
student
from
her
home
on
the
previous
evening
dorothy
looked
very
grave
while
effie
was
speaking
it
is
unfortunate
she
said
this
is
just
the
sort
of
thing
that
injures
a
girl
at
the
commencement
of
her
hospital
life
but
it
is
so
ridiculous
and
unjust
said
effie
what
in
the
world
can
lawson
be
to
me
oh
nothing
of
course
my
dear
replied
dorothy
but
still
the
rules
can
not
be
too
strict
on
this
point
you
know
i
am
not
a
prude
but
all
girls
are
not
like
you
effie
and
in
short
sister
kate
is
in
the
right
someone
must
have
seen
you
walking
back
with
lawson
and
must
have
told
her
or
hinted
at
least
at
the
state
of
the
case
nothing
else
would
have
induced
her
to
question
you
she
had
no
right
to
speak
to
me
about
acquaintances
that
i
meet
out
of
the
hospital
strictly
speaking
she
has
no
right
that
why
i
say
she
must
have
got
a
hint
oh
well
never
mind
her
said
effie
i
wo
speak
to
lawson
again
unless
i
meet
him
out
of
doors
where
i
can
and
shall
whatever
sister
kate
may
say
effie
you
must
be
careful
i
do
want
to
think
of
myself
at
all
ca
you
see
how
miserable
i
am
about
my
mother
and
about
george
yes
it
is
a
most
wretched
business
i
am
more
sorry
for
you
than
i
can
say
oh
i
wish
something
could
be
done
said
effie
i
feel
tired
and
fettered
here
i
feel
almost
wild
i
can
not
devote
myself
to
my
necessary
duties
poor
child
said
dorothy
in
her
caressing
voice
let
me
think
i
must
help
you
in
some
way
suppose
i
go
to
see
your
mother
i
had
a
chance
of
having
the
whole
afternoon
to
myself
but
as
i
had
nowhere
in
particular
to
go
was
determining
not
to
avail
myself
of
it
but
now
i
can
be
of
use
to
you
oh
dorothy
would
you
really
go
to
see
mother
it
will
be
of
the
greatest
possible
use
you
have
such
tact
you
can
say
things
that
no
one
else
would
venture
to
say
and
then
if
only
you
could
see
george
i
take
the
thing
up
somehow
said
dorothy
you
sha
be
dragged
and
worried
to
death
you
dear
brave
little
girl
give
me
a
kiss
effie
and
go
back
to
your
work
between
lawson
and
me
we
will
pull
you
through
this
trouble
see
if
we
do
do
you
know
lawson
dorothy
know
him
of
course
i
do
he
is
one
of
the
very
nicest
fellows
here
as
good
as
gold
and
as
steady
as
a
rock
and
with
such
a
beautiful
enthusiasm
for
his
profession
he
make
a
splendid
doctor
by
and
by
yes
effie
do
mistake
me
it
is
not
the
man
i
object
to
it
is
the
fact
that
he
is
a
medical
student
and
that
you
are
a
nurse
so
many
bad
things
have
been
said
about
nurses
and
medical
students
that
all
nurses
worthy
of
the
name
have
to
make
up
their
minds
to
show
the
world
that
they
can
and
will
nurse
without
even
the
thought
of
flirtation
coming
into
their
head
you
right
of
course
said
effie
with
burning
cheeks
but
it
a
shame
it
horrible
how
can
anyone
think
i
wish
to
flirt
she
turned
away
she
was
obliged
to
go
back
to
her
duties
but
her
heart
felt
much
lighter
after
her
conversation
with
dorothy
that
afternoon
sister
kate
watched
effie
as
she
would
could
find
no
fault
with
her
she
was
attentive
tactful
kind
and
considerate
a
little
bit
of
her
old
pleasant
cheerfulness
had
also
returned
to
her
her
face
looked
less
careworn
the
fact
is
she
was
leaning
on
dorothy
and
felt
the
comfort
of
dorothy
strong
support
the
patients
were
only
too
glad
for
effie
to
do
things
for
them
and
no
who
was
very
weak
and
low
smiled
whenever
the
girl
approached
her
bedside
hold
my
hand
love
whenever
you
have
a
minute
to
spare
said
the
poor
creature
i
feel
low
like
awfully
low
i
am
going
down
down
and
it
supports
me
to
hold
your
hand
you
a
good
girl
anyone
can
see
that
i
try
to
be
said
effie
tears
springing
to
her
eyes
ah
it
well
to
be
good
continued
the
woman
when
we
come
to
lie
as
i
lying
now
we
think
a
sight
of
goodness
i
hope
you
soon
be
better
said
effie
never
my
love
never
again
i
going
out
that
what
is
happening
to
me
it
a
lonesome
thing
to
die
but
i
do
feel
so
lonesome
when
holding
your
hand
effie
came
to
the
poor
creature
as
often
as
she
could
once
again
the
fascination
of
the
life
she
so
dearly
loved
drew
her
out
of
herself
and
enabled
her
to
forget
the
heavy
home
cares
in
her
bedroom
that
night
sister
dorothy
paid
her
a
visit
well
effie
she
said
i
news
for
you
lawson
saw
george
last
night
he
spoke
to
him
quite
frankly
and
said
that
if
he
did
not
immediately
give
over
this
awful
gambling
he
go
and
see
his
cousin
mr
gering
and
what
did
george
say
asked
effie
oh
he
promised
as
faithfully
as
possible
that
he
give
it
up
lawson
seemed
quite
pleased
with
him
and
said
he
did
think
he
have
been
so
penitent
and
so
easily
influenced
as
he
has
been
but
will
he
give
it
up
questioned
effie
he
promised
to
of
course
he
is
anxious
at
not
being
able
to
earn
more
money
for
the
foolish
fellow
encouraged
your
mother
to
be
extravagant
and
now
there
are
several
debts
which
must
be
met
somehow
what
the
matter
with
you
effie
why
do
you
start
how
can
i
help
it
debts
would
kill
mother
perhaps
i
ought
to
tell
you
dorothy
you
have
been
so
good
to
me
and
i
trust
you
so
much
that
i
do
think
it
can
be
wrong
to
tell
you
any
trouble
which
concerns
me
no
of
course
it
is
speak
out
what
is
in
your
mind
effie
well
george
was
in
trouble
that
time
he
came
to
see
father
that
time
when
father
was
dying
he
owed
lawson
i
ca
tell
you
how
i
ca
tell
you
why
he
said
that
if
the
money
were
not
paid
back
within
six
weeks
that
he
george
oh
dorothy
how
can
i
say
it
that
he
have
to
go
to
to
he
said
he
must
have
the
money
i
felt
too
that
he
must
have
the
money
for
our
mother
sake
so
i
went
to
see
squire
harvey
and
he
he
lent
it
to
me
dorothy
sat
down
on
the
side
of
the
bed
effie
story
made
her
feel
very
grave
she
paused
for
a
moment
puzzled
what
to
say
he
lent
me
the
money
continued
effie
looking
straight
at
her
friend
with
her
bright
eyes
i
know
he
never
wants
it
back
again
but
he
must
have
it
back
oh
yes
he
must
have
it
back
exclaimed
dorothy
well
he
lent
it
to
me
continued
effie
with
a
sigh
and
i
thought
of
course
that
george
would
be
all
right
after
that
and
i
arranged
that
the
squire
should
have
his
interest
regularly
i
thought
my
own
salary
would
nearly
cover
that
it
ca
be
done
interrupted
dorothy
your
salary
barely
pays
for
your
washing
and
your
few
expenses
it
absolutely
impossible
that
you
can
live
here
without
a
penny
the
little
you
earn
must
go
to
yourself
then
there
nothing
for
it
said
effie
i
must
go
where
i
can
earn
more
i
hate
the
thought
beyond
all
words
but
i
must
i
must
do
it
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
would
give
up
your
life
as
a
nurse
do
you
think
for
a
moment
dorothy
that
i
give
it
up
willingly
it
makes
me
sick
to
think
of
relinquishing
what
has
been
my
dream
ever
since
i
was
a
little
girl
but
i
see
plainly
that
i
must
do
something
to
earn
money
to
help
mother
and
then
if
george
does
keep
straight
perhaps
we
may
all
be
happy
some
day
tears
choked
effie
voice
her
eyes
grew
dim
what
do
you
think
of
doing
dear
said
dorothy
in
a
gentle
voice
i
go
to
the
harveys
and
ask
them
to
take
me
as
a
governess
for
freda
i
fancy
somehow
that
they
might
be
induced
to
give
me
a
good
salary
something
like
fifty
or
sixty
pounds
a
year
and
i
can
teach
a
child
like
freda
very
well
indeed
for
her
father
saw
that
i
was
well
educated
there
nothing
else
for
it
i
can
see
that
but
it
breaks
my
heart
all
the
same
chapter
xix
dorothy
talked
a
little
longer
to
effie
when
at
last
she
left
her
the
poor
girl
felt
soothed
and
strengthened
she
dropped
off
to
sleep
to
dream
of
the
old
days
when
she
was
living
in
the
pretty
little
cottage
in
whittington
and
when
she
longed
so
earnestly
to
go
out
into
the
wide
world
effie
woke
long
before
it
was
time
to
get
up
she
thought
of
her
dream
and
sighed
heavily
to
herself
she
was
in
the
wide
world
now
with
a
vengeance
did
it
look
as
fair
as
as
fascinating
as
it
used
to
look
in
her
early
dreams
no
the
reality
was
bitter
enough
she
would
have
given
a
great
deal
at
that
heavy
moment
of
her
life
to
turn
back
the
page
and
be
a
child
at
home
again
the
nurses
bell
rang
and
she
got
up
quickly
next
week
she
was
to
take
her
turn
at
she
was
getting
on
well
and
notwithstanding
the
small
cloud
which
now
existed
between
her
and
sister
kate
sister
kate
knew
effie
value
there
are
nurses
and
nurses
many
girls
who
go
as
probationers
to
the
great
hospitals
are
thoroughly
unsuited
to
the
life
their
qualifications
are
not
those
essential
to
the
good
nurse
they
are
destitute
of
tact
of
presence
of
mind
of
that
tenderness
which
can
be
firm
as
well
as
gentle
but
effie
was
an
ideal
nurse
her
soft
and
gentle
ways
her
kind
yet
firm
glance
the
cleverness
she
showed
the
tact
she
displayed
all
proved
to
sister
kate
that
the
young
probationer
might
one
day
be
a
valuable
help
to
her
she
was
angry
with
effie
at
present
but
she
was
determined
to
leave
no
stone
unturned
to
help
the
girl
and
train
her
thoroughly
in
her
noble
profession
during
that
night
sister
kate
had
thought
of
effie
she
had
noticed
her
pale
face
during
the
past
day
the
sadness
in
her
eyes
the
heaviness
in
her
steps
and
her
heart
smote
her
a
little
a
very
little
i
do
believe
that
girl
could
do
anything
mean
or
underhanded
she
reflected
of
course
it
is
tiresome
that
she
should
know
any
of
the
medical
students
but
i
believe
i
can
trust
her
word
that
she
will
never
speak
to
this
young
man
except
out
of
the
hospital
accordingly
sister
kate
met
effie
the
next
morning
with
much
of
her
old
pleasantness
effie
sad
heart
bounded
again
in
her
breast
when
sister
kate
spoke
kindly
to
her
and
she
went
about
her
duties
with
the
determination
not
to
leave
even
the
smallest
matter
undone
thoroughly
but
carefully
she
went
through
all
the
minutiæ
of
those
everlasting
cleanings
and
brushings
at
last
her
morning
work
was
over
and
now
came
the
crucial
moment
when
she
must
speak
to
sister
kate
the
doctors
had
gone
their
rounds
the
patients
were
all
settled
for
the
morning
effie
came
up
to
sister
kate
in
one
of
the
corridors
can
you
spare
me
a
few
moments
of
your
time
she
asked
the
sister
looked
up
at
the
tall
clock
in
the
passage
do
you
want
to
see
me
about
anything
important
she
asked
yes
it
is
something
important
well
come
into
my
private
room
i
can
give
you
five
minutes
sister
kate
sat
down
effie
stood
before
her
i
try
and
tell
you
what
i
want
as
briefly
as
possible
she
said
i
wish
to
know
if
i
can
be
spared
to
go
out
this
afternoon
it
is
not
your
afternoon
out
what
do
you
mean
i
would
ask
if
it
was
necessary
the
fact
is
there
great
trouble
at
home
and
i
i
must
see
my
mother
and
perhaps
i
may
have
to
make
another
visit
sister
kate
frowned
i
do
wish
not
to
sympathize
with
you
of
course
she
said
after
a
pause
but
the
fact
is
nurses
should
detach
themselves
as
much
as
possible
from
the
nurse
who
really
gives
herself
up
to
her
splendid
calling
has
to
try
to
forget
that
she
has
a
home
she
has
to
remember
that
her
first
duties
consist
in
taking
care
of
her
patients
and
in
learning
her
profession
then
i
ca
be
a
nurse
said
effie
the
color
rushing
into
her
face
sister
kate
looked
at
her
and
shook
her
head
i
am
very
sorry
she
said
after
a
pause
the
fact
is
i
had
great
hopes
of
you
you
have
many
of
the
qualifications
which
go
to
make
a
splendid
nurse
i
wo
recount
them
here
i
had
as
i
said
great
hopes
of
you
but
your
words
now
make
me
fear
that
excellent
as
those
qualifications
are
they
are
overbalanced
by
what
asked
effie
by
sentimentality
by
nervous
overworry
about
matters
which
you
should
leave
in
other
hands
i
have
no
other
hands
to
leave
them
in
the
fact
is
home
duties
must
always
be
first
with
me
i
got
a
mother
and
several
young
brothers
and
sisters
i
am
the
eldest
daughter
i
can
not
let
my
mother
suffer
even
to
indulge
what
has
been
for
a
long
time
the
great
dream
of
my
life
it
is
very
probable
that
i
shall
have
to
give
up
being
a
nurse
how
can
you
you
are
engaged
here
for
three
years
i
must
beg
of
the
governors
of
the
hospital
to
let
me
off
the
case
is
a
special
one
the
trouble
under
which
i
am
suffering
is
most
unexpected
i
fear
i
greatly
fear
that
i
shall
be
obliged
to
leave
the
hospital
for
a
time
i
am
truly
sorry
to
hear
that
said
sister
kate
does
your
friend
miss
fraser
know
of
this
yes
i
hope
it
may
not
be
necessary
as
i
said
you
have
the
making
of
a
good
nurse
in
you
you
want
to
go
away
for
a
few
hours
well
i
try
and
manage
it
perhaps
when
you
go
home
and
see
your
people
you
will
find
that
it
is
unnecessary
for
you
to
sacrifice
yourself
to
this
extent
anyhow
you
can
have
from
two
till
five
now
go
and
much
in
train
for
the
afternoon
as
you
can
you
can
stay
out
from
two
till
five
i
hope
you
have
good
news
for
me
when
you
return
i
hope
i
shall
said
effie
but
her
heart
felt
low
she
had
little
expectation
of
being
able
to
continue
the
life
which
she
longed
to
perfect
herself
in
at
two
she
went
out
and
did
not
take
many
minutes
in
reaching
her
mother
door
staunton
looked
surprised
to
see
her
what
is
the
matter
effie
she
said
how
white
and
worn
you
look
why
have
you
come
back
i
wanted
to
see
you
mother
so
i
got
an
afternoon
off
duty
sister
kate
was
kind
i
begged
of
her
to
let
me
come
i
have
a
great
longing
to
see
you
well
my
dear
i
all
right
the
fact
is
i
get
better
and
better
staunton
was
seated
by
the
window
she
was
making
a
pinafore
for
little
marjory
her
needle
flew
in
and
out
of
the
stuff
she
was
trimming
the
pinafore
with
narrow
lace
effie
took
it
up
and
sat
down
by
her
mother
your
hands
tremble
mother
are
you
really
well
oh
yes
my
love
yes
you
look
at
me
as
if
you
thought
there
was
something
the
matter
have
you
effie
your
looks
frighten
me
do
let
them
frighten
you
dear
mother
you
know
the
greatest
longing
of
my
heart
is
to
help
and
serve
you
if
there
is
anything
worrying
you
you
tell
me
wo
you
i
will
said
staunton
she
paused
and
looked
at
her
daughter
there
nothing
worrying
me
she
said
after
a
pause
but
still
i
feel
a
little
bit
anxious
you
tell
me
wo
you
you
wo
scold
me
effie
as
if
i
could
mother
darling
well
perhaps
i
did
a
rash
thing
poor
dear
george
you
know
how
devoted
i
am
to
him
effie
oh
yes
mother
darling
anyone
can
see
that
well
the
fact
is
i
i
yielded
to
his
entreaties
perhaps
i
ought
not
to
tell
you
effie
perhaps
it
will
displease
him
yes
do
tell
me
said
effie
there
ought
not
to
be
any
secrets
in
one
family
i
ought
to
know
i
will
know
you
are
worried
about
something
and
i
will
know
what
your
burden
is
what
is
it
mother
i
tell
you
in
a
few
words
there
nothing
in
it
after
all
shortly
after
you
left
us
george
persuaded
me
to
put
my
money
into
the
city
bank
in
his
name
he
said
it
seemed
such
folly
to
have
two
accounts
for
such
very
small
sums
you
did
it
said
effie
her
face
turning
white
yes
yes
i
knew
you
would
reproach
me
i
wo
be
reproached
i
wo
i
will
not
say
a
word
dearest
dearest
mother
take
my
hand
your
hand
does
shake
so
now
tell
me
all
about
it
oh
it
nothing
my
love
really
only
yes
mother
only
only
this
morning
i
asked
george
to
fill
in
a
check
for
me
before
he
went
to
town
he
did
so
it
was
for
five
pounds
he
seemed
vexed
at
my
requiring
so
much
but
i
said
i
could
do
with
less
for
there
was
the
landlady
to
pay
and
the
butcher
has
been
so
troublesome
with
his
bills
i
could
do
with
less
than
five
pounds
and
george
drew
a
check
for
me
for
that
amount
i
sent
aggie
with
it
straight
to
the
bank
and
staunton
face
became
very
pale
her
hand
shook
more
violently
than
ever
yes
mother
said
effie
they
sent
it
back
effie
with
written
across
the
back
i
am
sure
there
must
be
a
mistake
but
they
told
aggie
that
george
had
overdrawn
his
account
and
that
they
could
cash
this
check
there
were
no
effects
that
was
it
no
effects
said
effie
her
face
scarlet
but
had
you
some
of
your
money
still
left
in
the
bank
yes
i
had
over
fifty
pounds
i
put
the
money
into
the
bank
in
name
over
a
week
ago
it
was
to
last
us
for
some
time
oh
effie
look
at
me
with
those
reproachful
eyes
i
feel
faint
effie
got
up
quickly
she
poured
some
into
a
wineglass
and
filling
it
up
with
water
brought
it
to
her
mother
to
drink
staunton
was
soon
better
the
passing
weakness
went
off
quickly
what
is
to
be
done
she
said
raising
her
eyes
to
her
daughter
oh
i
am
so
glad
you
do
scold
me
effie
of
course
i
do
mother
darling
you
must
have
money
you
ca
get
on
without
it
that
just
what
i
say
i
am
sure
i
am
as
saving
as
woman
could
be
but
the
expenses
are
so
heavy
yes
of
course
i
expecting
george
in
every
minute
said
staunton
he
has
very
likely
put
the
money
back
into
the
bank
now
he
is
doing
such
a
splendid
business
that
perhaps
he
drew
the
fifty
pounds
meaning
to
return
it
at
once
he
has
such
a
capital
head
for
making
money
really
i
never
knew
such
a
boy
i
dare
say
he
has
put
it
back
oh
mother
do
you
know
better
how
can
he
do
that
but
now
let
us
talk
of
something
else
here
agnes
that
right
agnes
will
you
get
some
tea
for
mother
she

and

agnes

kettle

fire

check
she
asked
effie
in
a
whisper
oh
yes

make
a
fuss
over
it
it
will
be
all
right
robinson
says
she
must
be
paid

weeks
rent
and
she
wo

on
any
longer

minute
longer
than
i
can
help
wo
you
have
a
cup
of
tea
first
effie
no
no
i
no
time
effie
ran
downstairs
and
went
out
into
the
street
she
felt
nerved
and
braced
now
the
moment
of
indecision
was
past
the
moment
for
definite
action
had
arrived
there
was
no
question
with
regard
to
her
duty
it
lay
plain
and
straight
before
her
she
happened
to
know
that
the
harveys
were
in
town
they
were
staying
in
eaton
place
she
took
an
omnibus
which
presently
brought
her
into
the
neighborhood
of
victoria
a
few
minutes
afterward
she
rang
the
bell
at
their
hall
door
a
whom
she
did
not
know
opened
it
is
harvey
at
home
asked
effie
i
believe
so
he
replied
but
i
not
sure
if
she
can
see
anyone
perhaps
she
will
see
me
if
you
give
her
my
name
said
effie
in
a
gentle
voice
say
miss
effie
staunton
please
and
that
i
am
anxious
to
see
her
on
pressing
business
the
man
withdrew
inviting
effie
as
he
did
so
into
the
hall
he
takes
me
for
a
servant
she
said
to
herself
well
what
matter
that
truly
is
only
a
pinprick
in
a
minute
or
two
he
returned
with
a
changed
expression
on
his
face
follow
me
upstairs
please
miss
he
said
my
mistress
will
see
you
effie
followed
him
up
some
low
stairs
her
feet
sank
into
the
rich
carpets
the
contrast
between
this
luxurious
house
and
the
severity
of
the
hospital
sickened
her
i
shall
choke
if
i
live
here
she
said
to
herself
but
then
she
crushed
all
thought
of
self
the
men
led
her
up
two
or
three
short
flights
of
stairs
at
last
he
knocked
at
a
door
before
which
a
rich
curtain
hung
a
voice
said
come
in
and
effie
found
herself
in
harvey
presence
she
was
seated
in
a
deep
armchair
her
maid
stood
before
her
holding
out
different
rich
brocades
and
silks
which
had
just
been
sent
round
for
her
to
see
that
will
do
carey
she
said
when
she
saw
effie
you
can
take
all
those
things
away
tell
madam
miller
that
i
have
decided
on
this
blue
silk
crépon
and
this
silk
i
call
round
to
be
fitted
morning
now
miss
staunton
i
sorry
to
have
kept
you
waiting
how
do
you
do
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
harvey
was
not
so
impulsively
glad
as
she
had
been
the
last
time
she
saw
effie
the
doctor
death
the
death
he
had
died
for
her
seemed
removed
into
the
background
her
existence
was
absorbed
in
pleasure
in
gayety
and
excitement
she
had
an
affectionate
kindly
nature
however
and
one
glance
into
effie
sad
eyes
softened
her
toward
the
poor
girl
well
what
can
i
do
for
you
she
said
how
are
you
why
you
are
a
nurse
you
are
in
nurse
dress
how
capital
what
a
splendid
idea
yes
i
am
a
probationer
at
joseph
said
effie
oh
my
dear
child
that
splendid
for
you
of
course
but
i
trust
you
have
brought
no
infection
in
your
clothes
no
said
effie
with
the
faintest
of
smiles
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
any
of
the
infectious
wards
i
am
quite
safe
i
want
to
speak
to
you
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
listen
to
you
my
dear
you
know
of
course
that
the
squire
and
i
take
the
deepest
interest
in
you
and
in
your
family
by
the
way
how
is
your
dear
mother
and
how
are
all
those
pretty
girls
and
boys
getting
on
effie
could
not
remember
that
harvey
had
ever
seen
her
mother
why
therefore
should
she
speak
of
her
as
dear
and
as
to
the
boys
and
girls
they
were
not
specially
remarkable
for
their
good
looks
and
if
they
were
harvey
knew
nothing
about
it
she
answered
these
conventional
inquiries
in
a
quiet
voice
i
hope
you
forgive
me
she
said
at
the
first
possible
pause
but
i
am
in
a
very
great
hurry
i
have
promised
to
be
back
again
at
joseph
at
five
and
it
nearly
four
now
may
i
tell
you
what
i
really
came
about
oh
yes
of
course
of
course
do
you
remember
before
i
came
to
london
the
very
kind
offer
you
and
the
squire
made
me
of
course
said
harvey
if
you
mean
our
wish
that
you
should
become
governess
to
little
freda
but
freda
goes
to
a
kindergarten
now
carey
takes
her
around
every
morning
and
rhoda
goes
to
fetch
her
at
dinner
time
the
life
seems
to
suit
her
very
well
of
course
we
did
wish
for
you
very
much
but
as
you
could
not
come
oh
no
doubt
you
have
chosen
wisely
harvey
yawned
she
stretched
out
her
hand
and
rang
the
bell
the
servant
appeared
almost
immediately
tea
for
two
she
said
and
be
quick
andrews
i
ca
wait
for
tea
said
effie
rising
i
am
very
much
obliged
i
only
came
to
say
that
circumstances
would
make
me
inclined
to
accept
your
offer
now
but
as
you
do
want
a
governess
there
nothing
more
to
be
said
oh
it
so
sweetly
good
of
you
miss
staunton
and
had
matters
been
different
we
should
have
been
pleased
well
if
you
must
go
where
did
you
say
your
mother
lived
a
long
way
from
here
but
do
give
me
her
address
i
should
be
so
pleased
to
drive
round
and
see
her
some
day
perhaps
she
would
go
for
a
drive
with
me
what
a
good
idea
yes
i
come
where
did
you
say
you
lived
effie
had
not
said
anything
harvey
held
out
her
limp
long
hand
miss
staunton
you
know
i
take
a
great
interest
in
you
she
exclaimed
chapter
xx
just
at
this
moment
the
door
was
opened
and
the
squire
came
in
he
was
of
different
stuff
from
his
wife
when
he
saw
effie
his
face
beamed
with
pleasure
and
he
held
out
a
big
hearty
hand
miss
staunton
he
exclaimed
why
this
is
a
pleasure
oh
you
must
not
run
away
you
must
sit
down
and
tell
me
all
about
yourself
been
longing
to
hear
about
you
how
is
your
brother
in
the
city
and
your
mother
i
do
hope
she
is
a
little
better
and
all
those
other
lads
and
lasses
sit
down
my
clear
child
i
insist
on
it
i
have
lots
of
things
to
say
to
you
harvey
who
was
standing
near
the
mantelpiece
came
gently
forward
when
the
squire
began
to
speak
she
looked
at
effie
with
new
interest
her
face
was
long
and
pale
she
had
no
color
in
her
lips
her
light
hair
was
very
fashionably
dressed
she
wore
a
dress
of
the
latest
mode
and
her
thin
fingers
were
loaded
with
rings
which
flashed
and
shone
whenever
she
moved
her
hand
effie
hated
those
flashing
rings
she
turned
her
head
so
that
she
need
not
see
them
harvey
began
to
talk
in
a
high
falsetto
voice
to
her
husband
do
you
know
my
dear
she
exclaimed
that
miss
staunton
has
just
been
so
kind
she
came
here
to
offer
her
services
for
freda
but
you
know
dear
freda
is
getting
on
so
capitally
at
the
kindergarten
that
why
what
in
the
world
is
the
matter
walter
matter
exclaimed
the
squire
in
his
hearty
voice
why
that
we
be
such
fools
as
to
reject
miss
staunton
offer
i
was
told
only
a
few
minutes
ago
that
that
kindergarten
is
simply
full
of
and
measles
children
sickening
with
them
and
going
home
almost
every
day
i
was
going
to
say
that
freda
must
be
moved
oh
i
should
think
so
indeed
said
harvey
and
measles
how
terrible
and
i
never
had
why
i
be
able
to
go
out
for
the
whole
season
i
do
hope
and
trust
the
dear
child
has
contracted
the
infection
dear
miss
staunton
of
course
you
come
it
is
exactly
what
we
like
best
how
soon
can
you
come
neither
nor
said
effie
but
if
you
really
wish
for
me
and
if
we
agree
as
regards
terms
the
day
after
what
do
you
mean
by
saying
if
we
agree
as
to
terms
asked
harvey
i
want
a
big
salary
said
effie
looking
up
bravely
at
the
two
who
were
watching
her
with
expression
i
want
to
come
to
you
and
to
leave
the
work
which
i
love
best
because
i
hope
you
may
be
induced
to
give
me
an
exceptional
salary
i
want
the
money
because
my
mother
and
my
my
young
brothers
and
sisters
are
almost
at
least
they
will
be
if
i
do
get
it
almost
starving
effie
spoke
in
jerks
she
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
keeping
back
her
emotion
it
was
dreadful
to
have
to
plead
with
these
rich
people
these
people
who
knew
nothing
whatever
of
her
sore
need
to
whom
money
was
so
plentiful
as
to
have
lost
its
freshness
its
desirability
its
charm
it
was
awful
to
look
into
their
faces
to
see
the
blank
stare
which
came
into
harvey
pretty
blue
eyes
and
to
notice
the
puzzled
expression
on
the
squire
face
you
ca
mean
that
he
exclaimed
you
ca
mean
there
any
chance
of
that
there
is
a
chance
of
it
but
not
if
i
come
here
i
know
how
kind
you
are
how
noble
you
have
been
to
me
i
come
to
freda
i
do
everything
for
her
i
teach
her
and
i
play
with
her
and
love
her
and
i
nurse
her
if
she
is
ill
but
oh
do
please
be
generous
and
give
me
as
big
a
salary
as
you
can
what
do
you
expect
what
do
you
think
fair
asked
the
squire
i
thought
i
know
it
seems
a
great
deal
but
i
thought
you
might
be
willing
to
give
me
sixty
pounds
a
year
bless
you
my
dear
child
exclaimed
the
squire
if
you
accept
it
we
give
you
a
hundred
and
fifty
no
i
could
accept
that
said
effie
it
is
not
fair
why
not
we
could
get
anyone
else
to
exactly
take
your
place
for
the
money
and
remember
we
have
plenty
of
money
i
take
a
hundred
a
year
because
i
am
in
sore
distress
said
effie
after
a
brief
pause
and
and
will
you
pay
me
monthly
and
may
i
have
my
first
month
salary
in
advance
i
would
ask
it
if
they
want
it
at
home
will
you
do
this
yes
with
pleasure
said
the
squire
i
insist
on
your
accepting
ten
pounds
a
month
that
will
be
one
hundred
and
twenty
a
year
now
will
you
have
a
check
or
shall
i
give
you
the
money
in
gold
and
notes
the
gold
will
be
the
most
acceptable
said
effie
oh
i
feel
so
ashamed
she
added
why
should
you
you
give
us
an
equivalent
besides
it
makes
matters
more
tolerable
i
can
not
forget
oh
do
walter
do
allude
to
that
awful
time
cried
harvey
the
squire
shut
up
his
lips
he
took
a
little
bundle
of
gold
out
of
one
of
his
pockets
and
put
ten
sovereigns
into
effie
hand
it
is
a
bargain
he
said
i
can
not
tell
you
how
relieved
we
are
you
be
with
us
the
morning
after
next
elfreda
my
love
we
must
tell
our
little
freda
what
a
pleasure
is
in
store
for
her
yes
i
am
more
than
delighted
exclaimed
harvey
this
plan
suits
me
in
every
way
you
wo
fail
us
miss
staunton
for
in
case
freda
by
any
chance
has
taken
that
awful
you
can
keep
her
in
isolation
from
the
very
first
oh
yes
said
effie
smiling
but
i
dare
say
she
is
all
right
she
shook
hands
with
her
new
employers
and
left
the
house
the
gold
was
in
her
pocket
she
felt
that
she
had
sold
herself
and
her
mission
in
life
for
ten
sovereigns
it
is
the
present
need
which
makes
the
thing
so
desperate
she
said
under
her
breath
if
george
has
drawn
all
the
money
they
have
absolutely
nothing
to
live
on
but
more
will
come
in
and
there
this
to
go
on
with
we
manage
somehow
now
she
returned
to
the
lodgings
but
before
she
went
upstairs
she
had
an
interview
with
the
landlady
what
do
you
charge
my
mother
for
rent
she
asked
well
miss
staunton
exclaimed
the
woman
with
the
dinners
and
one
thing
and
another
i
am
obliged
to
make
it
a
pound
a
week
that
is
a
great
deal
too
much
said
effie
i
do
suppose
it
is
too
much
for
your
rooms
but
it
is
more
than
we
can
afford
just
now
when
we
first
came
to
you
you
agreed
to
let
us
the
rooms
without
attendance
for
fifteen
shillings
a
week
we
can
not
by
any
possible
management
afford
to
pay
more
but
staunton
wished
for
attendance
miss
she
said
it
made
all
the
difference
there
was
half
a
crown
for
attendance
and
half
a
crown
extra
for
kitchen
fire
but
the
kitchen
fire
was
included
in
the
fifteen
shillings
a
week
then
there
was
late
dinner
surely
there
is
no
late
dinner
now
exclaimed
effie
oh
yes
miss
every
evening
staunton
requires
a
nice
little
bit
of
dinner
sent
up
when
he
comes
home
you
see
miss
it
is
quite
impossible
for
me
to
have
extra
fires
without
charging
for
them
certainly
well
i
do
think
there
will
be
any
extra
dinner
in
future
and
now
please
tell
me
exactly
how
much
is
due
to
you
four
pounds
miss
but
if
i
paid
one
on
account
i
sha
mind
waiting
i
be
really
sorry
to
dislodge
such
a
nice
lady
as
your
mother
miss
staunton
here
is
the
money
in
full
said
effie
will
you
give
me
a
receipt
oh
with
pleasure
miss
wo
you
sit
down
i
hope
miss
staunton
nothing
will
induce
your
good
mother
to
move
from
here
i
will
do
everything
in
my
power
to
make
her
comfortable
you
must
understand
said
effie
that
in
future
she
only
pays
fifteen
shillings
a
week
without
extras
my
sisters
agnes
and
katie
are
quite
old
enough
to
do
all
the
waiting
which
my
mother
requires
in
fact
they
must
do
so
for
we
ca
afford
to
pay
a
penny
more
am
i
to
understand
miss
that
there
no
late
dinner
certainly
not
very
well
i
am
sure
i
do
all
in
my
power
to
oblige
effie
left
her
putting
her
receipt
carefully
in
her
pocket
as
she
did
so
she
went
upstairs
and
entered
the
little
where
her
mother
was
now
pacing
quickly
and
restlessly
up
and
down
there
was
a
deep
flush
on
her
cheeks
and
a
look
of
despair
in
her
eyes
oh
effie
you
come
she
exclaimed
the
moment
she
saw
her
daughter
george
has
been
in
there
something
wrong
i
know
i
know
there
is
he
came
in
just
for
a
minute
and
he
kissed
me
and
said
he
was
coming
home
and
he
he
looked
he
stuffed
a
few
things
into
a
bag
and
said
i
was
to
expect
him
back
i
did
dare
ask
him
about
the
money
what
what
can
be
the
matter
effie
chapter
xxi
effie
did
all
in
her
power
to
soothe
her
mother
it
was
past
the
hour
for
her
return
to
joseph
but
under
the
present
circumstances
she
could
not
give
this
matter
a
thought
staunton
was
strung
up
to
a
terrible
condition
of
nervousness
she
walked
faster
and
faster
about
the
room
she
scarcely
spoke
aloud
but
muttered
words
under
her
breath
which
no
one
could
hear
at
every
footfall
on
the
stairs
she
started
sometimes
she
went
to
the
door
and
flung
it
open
sometimes
she
went
to
the
window
and
pressed
her
face
against
the
glass
darkness
set
in
and
the
lamps
were
lit
in
the
street
katie
went
to
the
window
to
pull
down
the
blinds
no
do
touch
them
said
staunton
fretfully
she
still
kept
staring
out
into
the
street
presently
she
called
effie
to
her
does
that
man
turning
the
corner
look
something
like
george
she
exclaimed
effie
looked
eagerly
no
that
not
george
she
said
agnes
you
have
better
sight
called
staunton
to
her
next
daughter
come
and
watch
with
me
we
are
sure
to
see
him
soon
it
be
that
he
has
gone
away
for
the
night
for
the
whole
night
is
that
him
look
at
that
man
that
one
crossing
the
road
that
one
in
the
waterproof
oh
how
hard
it
is
raining
if
george
is
out
much
longer
he
be
drenched
to
the
skin
aggie
look
and
you
katie
ca
you
watch
now
man
is
that
george
no
no
mother
answered
the
poor
children
in
affright
staunton
kept
on
making
exclamations
again
and
again
she
cried
out
hopefully
that
surely
george
was
coming
now
but
george
himself
never
really
appeared
effie
knew
that
she
would
get
into
hopeless
disgrace
at
joseph
no
matter
she
could
not
leave
her
mother
at
such
a
moment
each
instant
she
became
more
anxious
about
her
she
called
agnes
aside
and
told
her
that
she
had
put
a
stop
to
the
late
dinner
and
also
to
the
extra
attendance
but
as
probably
some
dinner
had
been
ordered
for
that
evening
she
had
better
go
down
and
bring
it
up
as
staunton
must
be
forced
to
eat
at
any
cost
agnes
tripped
out
of
the
room
and
presently
returned
with
a
couple
of
pork
chops
and
some
baked
potatoes
she
flung
them
down
on
the
table
exclaiming
that
the
tray
was
heavy
she
looked
cross
and
evidently
seemed
to
think
that
effie
was
making
a
great
fuss
over
nothing
why
ca
george
be
away
for
a
single
night
without
everyone
getting
into
such
a
state
she
murmured
effie
took
the
tray
from
her
and
gave
her
a
look
of
reproach
she
laid
the
cloth
herself
and
made
the
table
look
as
pretty
as
she
could
she
then
went
to
her
mother
drew
her
gently
but
firmly
away
from
the
window
and
making
her
sit
down
tried
to
coax
her
to
eat
staunton
looked
at
the
chops
with
dazed
eyes
those
were
for
george
she
exclaimed
what
a
shame
to
bring
them
up
before
he
has
come
into
the
house
they
be
cold
and
sodden
and
he
hates
his
food
sodden
you
do
suppose
i
going
to
touch
my
dinner
no
not
i
put
the
chops
down
in
the
fender
aggie
when
george
comes
in
i
always
ring
the
bell
twice
how
careless
of
robinson
effie
my
dear
i
do
think
we
can
stop
with
her
if
she
treats
us
in
this
fashion
it
perfectly
disgraceful
to
cook
george
food
before
he
is
ready
for
it
agnes
began
to
explain
that
george
was
not
coming
home
but
effie
silenced
her
with
a
look
she
saw
to
her
horror
that
her
mother
mind
was
beginning
to
wander
she
was
really
expecting
george
who
had
not
the
faintest
idea
of
coming
back
poor
effie
saw
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
humor
her
mother
she
put
the
food
inside
the
fender
and
then
going
to
a
davenport
in
a
corner
of
the
room
wrote
a
hasty
letter
to
dorothy
fraser
we
in
great
trouble
she
wrote
i
know
you
ca
come
i
know
it
is
absolutely
impossible
for
you
to
come
but
neither
can
i
go
back
to
joseph
this
evening
please
tell
sister
kate
make
any
excuse
for
me
you
like
say
anything
that
comes
into
your
head
my
career
as
a
nurse
is
ended
a
big
tear
dropped
from
effie
eyes
as
she
wrote
these
last
words
she
folded
up
the
letter
and
gave
it
to
agnes
agnes
she
said
you
must
take
this
at
once
to
hospital
oh
i
do
know
how
to
get
there
said
agnes
and
i
was
never
out
so
late
before
in
the
evening
i
am
sorry
to
have
to
send
you
stay
you
had
better
take
kate
with
you
it
would
be
better
for
the
two
of
you
to
be
together
put
on
your
hats
and
your
warm
jackets
do
be
longer
away
than
you
can
help
you
have
just
to
give
this
note
to
the
hall
porter
and
come
straight
back
you
must
take
the
red
omnibus
that
goes
along
oxford
street
and
effie
added
a
few
more
practical
directions
agnes
eyes
sparkled
at
the
thought
of
a
little
variety
in
her
dull
life
katie
ran
willingly
into
her
room
to
fetch
her
own
and
her
sister
hats
and
jacket
they
were
dressed
in
a
very
short
time
effie
heard
them
running
downstairs
and
listened
to
the
slam
of
the
hall
door
she
had
now
set
the
irrevocable
seal
to
her
own
act
she
had
deliberately
turned
her
back
on
the
life
that
she
loved
she
stood
for
a
moment
with
a
dizzy
feeling
in
her
head
then
with
a
little
prayer
which
she
sadly
needed
to
help
her
she
put
aside
all
regret
and
turned
with
a
brave
heart
to
face
the
dark
present
and
the
gloomy
future
staunton
stood
near
the
window
with
her
back
to
her
daughter
effie
listened
with
a
sick
heart
to
her
mutterings
she
knew
that
her
mother
could
not
possibly
get
better
if
she
refused
to
eat
she
was
wondering
what
to
do
and
how
she
could
dare
to
leave
her
when
a
quick
step
was
heard
running
up
the
stairs
and
the
next
moment
fred
lawson
came
in
effie
never
to
her
dying
day
forgot
the
feeling
of
relief
of
almost
joy
which
ran
through
her
heart
when
she
saw
his
clever
resolute
face
he
came
in
in
his
usual
quick
brisk
determined
way
stopped
short
a
little
when
he
saw
her
and
then
glanced
significantly
at
her
mother
staunton
had
turned
as
eagerly
as
effie
when
she
heard
the
quick
footsteps
now
her
face
was
an
absolute
blank
she
had
come
a
step
forward
her
hands
suddenly
fell
to
her
sides
my
mother
is
not
well
said
effie
she
upset
no
i
not
upset
you
greatly
mistaken
said
staunton
why
should
i
be
upset
there
not
a
happier
woman
in
christendom
than
i
am
it
true
my
beloved
husband
has
left
me
but
then
i
have
got
my
boy
there
never
was
a
braver
boy
how
do
you
do
lawson
pray
forgive
me
for
not
shaking
hands
with
you
when
you
came
into
the
room
the
fact
is
i
have
been
expecting
george
his
dinner
is
in
the
fender
the
landlady
did
very
wrong
indeed
to
send
it
up
before
i
rang
for
it
i
always
ring
twice
for
george
dinner
do
you
understand
it
is
a
good
plan
george
likes
his
meals
hot
and
tasty
no
wonder
he
earns
them
he
is
a
dear
good
fellow
he
is
getting
a
fine
salary
did
you
happen
to
meet
him
on
the
stairs
perhaps
you
passed
him
he
is
a
little
late
just
a
little
late
effie
can
you
tell
me
if
lawson
has
good
sight
if
he
has
perhaps
he
come
and
watch
by
the
window
i
watching
but
my
eyes
are
a
little
weak
at
times
i
might
not
see
george
when
he
is
really
there
will
you
come
and
see
lawson
he
ought
to
be
coming
now
my
dear
boy
my
dearest
my
boy
lawson
gave
effie
a
glance
in
a
moment
he
read
the
true
position
the
poor
weak
brain
had
suddenly
given
way
he
went
up
gently
to
staunton
and
took
one
of
her
hot
hands
in
his
when
george
comes
in
he
said
i
be
here
and
i
tell
him
about
his
dinner
i
know
he
be
late
and
you
must
wait
up
for
him
any
longer
come
miss
effie
will
put
you
into
bed
when
you

her
mother
to
undress
when
she
saw
her
lay
her
head
on
the
pillow
she
went
back
to
the
sitting
room
where
lawson
was
quietly
standing
i
happened
most
fortunately

said
the
moment

saw
her
to
have
some
packets
of
bromide
in
my
pocket
there

in
the
room
i
have
made
up
a
rather
strong
for
your
mother
if

it
she
will
sleep
peacefully
and
will
not
be
likely
to
wake
until

it
to
her
at
once
and
then
come
back
to
me
i
have
something
to
tell
you
effie
trembling
knees
could
scarcely
support
her
as
she
went
back

the
next
room

the
mother

good

great
comfort

me

to
the
hospital
it
was
a
mad
foolish
scheme
and
george
never
liked
it
you
are
a
great
comfort
to
me
and
a
great
comfort
to
your
dear
brother

give
him
his
dinner

when
he

to
sleep
dear
mother
staunton
drank
off
the
medicine
laid
her
head
on
her
pillow
and
closed
her
dim
dark
eyes
effie
watched
by
her
until
she
thought
she
was
dropping
asleep
pretty
little
marjory
was
lying
sound
asleep
in
the
same
bed
phil
opened
his
big
eyes
as
his
sister
passed
is
anything
the
matter
he
whispered
is
anything
wrong
with
george
pray
for
him
phil
said
effie
tears
suddenly
filling
her
eves
yes
yes
said
the
little
fellow
i
always
do
effie
went
into
the
next
room
you
have
plenty
of
pluck
have
you
said
lawson
when
he
saw
her
i
hope
so
i
had
need
to
have
yes
i
know
that
well
that
unfortunate
boy
has
put
his
foot
in
it
at
last
he
is
in
trouble
detectives
are
after
him
detectives
after
george
exclaimed
effie
what
can
you
possibly
mean
oh
do
tell
me
at
once
do
leave
me
in
suspense
sit
down
and
i
will
tell
you
try
not
to
agitate
yourself
try
to
listen
to
me
quietly
remember
that
a
brave
woman
can
always
control
her
nerves
effie
sat
down
when
lawson
bade
her
something
in
his
quiet
but
resolute
voice
soothed
her
impatience
she
looked
up
at
him
as
he
stood
by
the
mantelpiece
resting
one
arm
on
it
the
facts
are
these
he
began
at
once
staunton
has
been
going
wrong
for
a
long
time
i
know
it
i
know
it
well
interrupted
effie
yes
i
feared
that
you
knew
it
poor
fellow
soon
after
his
arrival
in
london
he
got
with
bad
companions
he
has
naturally
extravagant
tastes
they
introduced
him
to
some
of
those
gambling
saloons
given
a
weak
nature
the
love
of
money
for
the
pleasure
it
can
give
a
will
weakened
with
and
the
result
is
easy
to
forecast
george
has
been
going
from
bad
to
worse
for
months
past
he
has
sometimes
won
considerable
sums
of
money
and
these
successes
have
excited
him
to
try
again
with
this
devil
luck
as
the
saying
is
of
late
however
that
luck
has
turned
against
him
and
the
events
which
took
place
are
only
the
natural
consequences
effie
rose
slowly
from
her
seat
go
on
she
said
coming
up
to
lawson
what
took
place
go
on
please
i
am
quiet
i
am
prepared
for
anything
lawson
gave
her
a
look
of
admiration
you
are
a
brave
girl
he
said
briefly
the
world
would
be
a
better
place
if
there
were
more
like
you
in
it
well
what
took
place
is
this
staunton
won
heavily
at
cards
the
night
before
last
not
content
with
his
gains
however
he
persevered
until
the
luck
turned
against
him
before
he
left
the
gambling
saloon
he
had
lost
all
his
gains
and
was
in
debt
fifty
pounds
to
meet
that
debt
he
drew
your
mother
money
from
the
bank
yesterday
morning
i
know
said
effie
with
white
lips
mother
told
me
she
sent
agnes
to
the
bank
to
cash
a
small
check
agnes
was
told
that
george
account
was
overdrawn
yes
i
know
that
is
there
more
behind
surely
that
must
be
the
worst
alas
i
wish
it
were
this
morning
the
poor
fellow
while
engaged
in
his
duties
at
gering
office
met
with
the
temptation
for
which
he
was
so
ripe
it
was
a
horrible
one
he
knew
that
your
mother
had
not
a
penny
his
feeling
for
her
i
need
not
enter
upon
he
found
himself
in
the
room
with
an
open
till
and
took
fifty
pounds
out
of
it
soon
afterwards
he
made
an
excuse
to
leave
the
office
he
wandered
about
all
day
in
an
indescribable
state
of
misery
at
last
he
summoned
courage
to
go
to
the
bank
and
deposit
of
the
fifty
pounds
he
then
rushed
home
and
packing
his
things
prepared
to
run
away
he
said
he
was
certain
to
be
taken
if
he
stayed
and
simply
could
not
bring
himself
to
face
the
risk
he
went
to
waterloo
and
to
his
horror
discovered
that
he
was
watched
a
man
undoubtedly
a
detective
in
plain
clothes
was
following
him
from
place
to
place
the
man
watched
him
take
his
ticket
for
southampton
and
noticed
the
corner
in
which
he
deposited
his
bag
in
a
carriage
george
seemed
to
lose
his
head
at
this
crisis
he
managed
to
elude
the
detective
slipped
out
of
the
station
took
a
hansom
and
drove
straight
to
my
rooms
luckily
i
was
at
home
he
made
a
clean
breast
of
everything
to
me
he
is
in
my
rooms
now
and
safe
for
the
time
being
for
no
one
will
think
of
looking
for
him
there
i
want
you
to
come
with
me
at
once
to
see
him
for
there
is
not
a
moment
to
be
lost
in
deciding
what
is
best
to
be
done
yes
said
effie
i
will
come
she
felt
stunned
her
keenest
feelings
of
anguish
were
lulled
into
momentary
quiet
by
the
greatness
of
this
blow
i
will
write
a
note
to
agnes
she
said
she
is
out
i
had
to
send
her
to
the
hospital
to
say
that
i
could
not
return
there
then
she
added
her
face
turning
whiter
than
ever
if
my
mother
knows
of
this
it
will
kill
her
your
mother
is
the
person
to
be
considered
of
course
said
lawson
but
for
her
i
should
say
that
the
best
thing
possible
for
george
would
be
to
undergo
the
punishment
which
he
merits
as
it
is
however
matters
are
different
well
write
your
note
and
let
us
be
quick
that
strong
opiate
will
keep
your
mother
sleeping
quietly
until
the
morning
all
your
sister
has
to
do
is
to
watch
her
effie
drew
a
sheet
of
paper
toward
her
scribbled
a
few
hasty
lines
on
it
folded
it
up
and
left
it
where
agnes
could
see
it
the
moment
she
returned
then
she
followed
lawson
into
the
street
he
hailed
a
passing
hansom
and
they
drove
straight
to
his
rooms
on
the
embankment
the
feeling
of
a
dream
remained
with
effie
all
during
that
drive
she
kept
rubbing
her
eyes
and
saying
to
herself
it
only
a
dream
i
shall
awaken
presently
and
find
myself
back
at
st
joseph
the
hansom
drew
up
at
the
lodgings
and
lawson
preceded
effie
upstairs
he
threw
open
the
door
of
his
little
sitting
room
come
in
he
said
here
is
your
sister
staunton
he
sang
out
effie
entered
she
found
herself
in
a
small
bright
room
the
gas
was
turned
full
on
one
of
the
windows
was
open
a
fresh
breeze
from
the
river
came
in
george
was
seated
on
a
sofa
at
the
farthest
end
of
the
room
he
held
a
small
in
his
hand
and
was
making
imaginary
patterns
with
it
on
the
carpet
his
shoulders
were
hitched
up
to
his
ears
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
ground
effie
looked
at
him
she
said
george
i
am
here
i
have
come
he
did
not
make
any
response
she
gave
a
little
cry
when
he
took
no
notice
of
her
and
sank
down
helplessly
on
the
nearest
chair
lawson
strode
across
the
room
and
grasped
george
shoulder
look
here
staunton
he
said
you
have
got
to
pull
yourself
together
i
have
brought
your
sister
here
to
consult
what
is
best
to
be
done
look
up
old
chap
take
courage
all
is
lost
yet
now
try
and
tell
your
sister
everything
i
have
nothing
to
tell
her
said
george
he
raised
two
lackluster
eyes
and
fixed
them
with
a
sort
of
dull
stare
on
lawson
face
do
talk
folly
you
have
to
tell
her
what
you
told
me
you
know
the
position
you
are
in
you
may
be
arrested
at
any
moment
no
one
can
help
you
but
your
sister
do
turn
away
from
her
oh
i
understand
all
that
said
george
shrugging
his
shoulder
out
of
lawson
grip
i
know
well
enough
what
has
happened
i
have
gone
under
i
only
one
more
i
i
ca
help
it
i
have
nothing
to
say
lawson
looked
at
the
big
fellow
almost
in
despair
he
was
really
puzzled
what
to
do
this
was
the
moment
however
for
effie
to
take
the
initiative
she
sprang
suddenly
to
her
feet
dashed
the
tears
from
her
eyes
and
went
up
to
her
brother
she
fell
on
her
knees
by
his
side
and
put
her
soft
arms
round
his
neck
think
of
the
old
days
geordie
she
said
when
we
were
both
little
children
think
of
mother
and
father
and
the
little
old
house
and
the
apple
tree
in
the
garden
do
you
remember
the
day
when
that
ripe
red
apple
fell
and
we
ate
it
bite
about
when
effie
began
to
speak
george
trembled
he
avoided
her
eyes
for
a
moment
longer
then
he
gave
her
a
quick
furtive
glance
changed
voice
before
god
i
could
help
it
a
changed
voice
before
god
i
could
help
it
transcriber
note
these
two
fragmented
lines
appear
as
shown
at
this
point
in
the
original
text
lawson
stepped
softly
out
of
the
room
the
moment
he
had
done
so
george
said
eagerly
he
has
told
you
has
he
effie
nodded
then
i
need
go
over
it
let
talk
of
something
else
how
is
mother
she
is
very
ill
indeed
she
watched
for
you
all
the
evening
watched
for
me
but
i
told
her
i
should
be
back
yes
but
she
did
believe
you
or
she
forgot
it
anyhow
she
watched
for
you
and
when
you
did
come
her
mind
began
suddenly
to
wander
she
is
in
bed
now
she
is
very
very
go
on
said
george
hammer
it
in
hard
i
deserve
it
all
oh
george
why
will
you
talk
like
that
do
you
believe
in
my
love
for
you
i
believe
in
mother
love
it
the
only
thing
i
have
left
to
cling
to
i
believe
she
go
on
loving
me
even
after
this
i
do
truly
of
course
she
would
nothing
could
turn
her
love
from
you
now
you
let
us
consult
together
when
lawson
comes
into
the
room
there
nothing
to
be
done
nothing
i
perfectly
safe
to
be
committed
for
trial
and
then
i
shall
get
at
least
two
years
mother
will
die
and
i
shall
have
gone
under
forever
nonsense
i
have
a
thought
in
my
head
you
george
spoke
with
almost
contempt
you
always
thought
a
great
deal
of
yourself
effie
but
even
you
ca
pull
the
ropes
on
the
present
occasion
i
a
thief
and
i
must
suffer
the
penalty
that
the
long
and
short
of
it
effie
rose
suddenly
and
walked
to
the
door
she
called
lawson
he
came
in
at
once
i
think
george
will
talk
over
matters
now
she
said
but
before
we
begin
any
discussion
i
wish
to
say
what
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
do
i
do
know
gering
but
that
does
not
matter
i
mean
to
go
to
see
him
the
first
thing
morning
and
beg
of
him
not
to
prosecute
george
that
is
the
only
chance
for
mother
life
and
i
mean
to
try
it
chapter
xxii
when
effie
said
these
words
lawson
gave
her
a
startled
glance
and
george
sulkiness
seemed
to
vanish
magically
he
opened
his
lips
as
if
to
speak
then
closed
them
again
a
rush
of
color
spread
over
his
face
and
he
turned
his
head
aside
i
fear
it
is
impossible
that
you
can
do
the
least
vestige
of
good
miss
staunton
said
lawson
all
the
same
it
is
a
brave
thought
and
worthy
of
you
george
looked
round
when
lawson
said
this
he
fully
expected
effie
to
explain
herself
more
fully
to
argue
the
point
and
to
give
her
reasons
for
approaching
gering
to
the
surprise
of
both
the
men
however
she
was
silent
after
a
little
pause
she
said
turning
to
lawson
do
you
think
george
will
be
safe
here
until
the
morning
i
do
perfectly
safe
answered
lawson
then
i
will
say
i
will
come
to
you
george
if
i
have
news
in
the
morning
oh
you
wo
have
news
replied
george
there
never
was
such
a
hard
nut
to
crack
as
old
gering
effie
made
no
reply
she
said
to
her
brother
he
did
not
offer
to
kiss
her
but
he
took
her
hand
and
gave
it
a
silent
squeeze
it
seemed
to
effie
then
that
she
got
near
his
heart
lawson
took
her
downstairs
and
put
her
into
a
cab
you
are
only
wasting
your
time
in
going
to
gering
he
said
as
he
stood
for
a
moment
at
the
cab
door
i
must
waste
it
then
replied
effie
for
whatever
the
consequence
i
am
going
then
if
you
will
go
you
had
better
do
so
early
gering
is
always
at
his
office
by
nine
george
may
quite
possibly
be
arrested
morning
and
brought
before
the
magistrates
at
bow
street
at
ten
or
when
once
he
is
arrested
gering
can
do
nothing
the
law
then
takes
up
the
case
and
prosecutes
on
its
own
account
you
will
see
therefore
that
if
you
wish
to
save
your
brother
you
must
be
astir
betimes
i
quite
see
and
thank
you
very
much
said
effie
lawson
said
the
cab
rolled
away
and
effie
soon
found
herself
back
again
at
her
own
lodgings
she
ran
upstairs
to
find
that
her
mother
was
still
sound
asleep
she
sent
the
two
tired
girls
to
bed
and
lying
down
on
the
sofa
in
the
sitting
room
tried
to
sleep
she
had
left
her
mother
door
slightly
ajar
and
knew
that
she
would
hear
the
least
movement
in
the
room
all
was
perfect
stillness
however
and
presently
effie
fell
into
a
light
doze
she
awoke
long
before
the
dawn
of
day
thought
carefully
over
the
whole
complex
situation
and
then
rose
and
dressed
herself
she
slipped
softly
into
her
mother
room
the
opiate
was
still
taking
effect
staunton
face
looked
pinched
and
drawn
as
it
lay
on
the
pillow
there
were
blue
lines
under
the
eyes
and
a
blue
tint
round
the
lips
which
spoke
of
heart
trouble
but
just
at
the
present
moment
the
spirit
was
at
peace
and
the
body
resting
calmly
poor
mother
murmured
effie
poor
tried
faithful
heart
if
you
really
knew
what
i
know
you
could
not
survive
the

what
i
can
to
save

only
a
weak
girl
but
sometimes
girls
like
me

power

will
not
be
afraid
i
will
go
now
to
exercise
all
the
power
that
is
in
me
effie
left
the
room
she
went
to
the
one
where
her
sisters
slept
changed
her
dress
and
washed
herself
and
then
waking
agnes
to
tell
her
to
be
sure
to
look
after
her
mother
she
ran
downstairs
the
landlady
robinson
met
her
in
the
passage
why
surely
miss
staunton
she
said
you
are
not
going
out
on
a
raw
foggy
morning
like
this
without
breakfast
oh
i
ca
wait
for
breakfast
exclaimed
effie
i
have
some
tea
in
my
sitting
room

in
and
let
me
give
you
a
cup
miss
do
now
you
so
white
you
look
as
if
you
drop
thank
you
said
effie
after
a
little
pause
i
should
be
very
glad
of
a
cup
of
tea
she
added
the
landlady
bustled
her
into
her
little
sitting
room
seated
her
by
the
fire
and
would
not
leave
her
alone
until
she
had
swallowed
a
cup
of
tea
and
a
piece
of
toast
i
all
the
better
for
the
tea
said
effie
thank
you
very
much
the
kindness
cheered
the
poor
girl
she
looked
upon
it
as
a
good
omen
she
walked
quickly
up
the
narrow
street
which
led
into
the
larger
thoroughfare
and
was
soon
on
her
way
to
gering
office
in
leadenhall
street
she
arrived
there
just
as
the
clock
was
striking
nine
she
did
not
allow
herself
even
to
feel
nervous
but
walking
boldly
in
asked
to
see
gering
at
once
have
you
an
appointment
with
him
asked
the
clerk
whom
she
addressed
no
but
i
hope
he
will
see
me
without
that
my
business
is
very
pressing
what
is
your
name
miss
staunton
effie
hesitated
for
a
minute
then
she
said
abruptly
i
am
the
sister
of
george
staunton
who
is
a
clerk
here
the
moment
she
uttered
the
words
every
clerk
in
the
place
looked
up
with
interest
and
one
coming
up
in
a
somewhat
familiar
way
said
cavalierly
i
do
think
there
the
least
use
in
your
troubling
gering
i
may
as
well
tell
you
beforehand
that
he
certainly
wo
see
you
at
this
moment
a
man
came
out
of
an
inner
room
he
spoke
to
the
head
clerk
who
gave
him
a
bundle
of
letters
take
these
to
gering
at
once
he
said
effie
followed
this
man
with
her
eyes
the
other
clerks
stared
at
her
expecting
her
to
go
she
looked
at
the
one
to
whom
she
had
first
spoken
will
you
take
my
message
to
mr
gering
she
said
will
you
tell
him
that
effie
staunton
george
staunton
sister
wishes
to
see
him
on
most
important
business
there
was
much
distress
in
her
tone
but
withal
such
firmness
that
the
clerk
could
not
help
looking
at
her
with
admiration
i
would
gladly
take
your
message
miss
staunton
but
it
would
be
useless
i
know
beforehand
that
nothing
will
induce
gering
to
see
you
he
must
see
me
replied
effie
in
a
firm
voice
if
no
one
here
will
be
polite
enough
to
take
him
my
message
i
will
go
to
him
myself
before
one
of
the
clerks
could
prevent
her
effie
walked
across
the
large
room
opened
the
door
where
the
clerk
who
took
gering
his
letters
had
vanished
and
found
herself
the
next
moment
in
a
handsomely
furnished
room
where
a
portly
old
gentleman
was
seated
at
a
desk
he
looked
up
in
unfeigned
astonishment
when
he
saw
a
pretty
girl
standing
near
the
door
as
she
did
not
speak
for
an
instant
he
raised
his
voice
with
an
inquiry
may
i
ask
what
you
are
doing
here
he
said
i
have
come
to
speak
to
you
about
my
brother
said
effie
your
brother
what
do
you
mean
who
is
your
brother
george
staunton
then
miss
staunton
let
me
tell
you
that
you
have
taken
a
great
liberty
in
coming
to
see
me
you
have
forced
your
way
into
my
room
unannounced
i
must
ask
you
to
have
the
goodness
to
retire
as
quickly
as
you
came
if
you
do
not
leave
my
room
this
moment
i
shall
be
forced
to
compel
you
to
go
no
you
will
not
said
effie
no
that
is
not
like
you
you
would
not
willingly
be
unkind
to
a
suffering
and
innocent
girl
when
she
forces
herself
against
her
true
inclinations
against
her
real
modesty
to
seek
an
interview
with
you
i
come
in
great
sorrow
and
despair
and
you
are
not
the
man
who
will
treat
me
roughly
i
do
fear
it
you
like
to
say
harsh
words
but
your
heart
is
not
harsh
i
beg
of
you
therefore
to
listen
to
my
story
i
will
not
keep
you
long
you
are
a
very
queer
courageous
sort
of
girl
said
gering
after
a
pause
as
you
have
come
i
suppose
i
may
as
well
listen
to
you
but
please
understand
at
once
that
i
have
no
mercy
for
your
brother
that
his
career
here
is
ended
that
is
only
just
and
right
i
have
not
come
to
plead
with
you
to
take
george
back
i
know
that
that
would
be
asking
too
much
what
i
have
come
to
say
i
can
say
in
a
very
few
words
they
must
be
very
few
if
you
expect
me
to
leave
my
business
to
attend
to
them
effie
came
close
to
where
gering
was
seated
he
did
not
rise
nor
motion
her
to
a
chair
at
this
moment
the
clerk
who
had
refused
to
take
her
message
entered
the
room
leave
us
for
a
moment
power
said
gering
the
man
withdrew
immediately
thank
you
said
effie
then
she
added
abruptly
i
wo
keep
you
a
moment
i
will
tell
you
quite
simply
what
i
want
my
brother
george
has
behaved
very
badly
to
put
it
plainly
interrupted
gering
your
brother
george
is
a
scoundrel
you
may
call
him
any
names
you
please
said
effie
i
have
not
come
here
to
defend
him
i
know
that
he
stole
fifty
pounds
from
you
yesterday
oh
you
know
that
do
you
yes
pounds
of
that
money
he
put
into
the
city
bank
in
my
mother
name
that
pounds
you
can
have
back
within
an
hour
we
shall
then
be
in
your
debt
five
pounds
which
i
want
you
to
let
me
pay
you
back
i
have
just
secured
a
very
good
situation
as
a
governess
and
am
to
be
in
receipt
of
one
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
a
year
i
can
pay
you
back
the
money
in
about
a
month
time
out
of
my
own
salary
you
are
very
conscientious
said
gering
with
a
slight
sneer
and
i
shall
be
glad
to
have
my
money
back
if
that
is
all
your
business
perhaps
you
will
leave
me
no
it
is
not
all
my
business
i
want
you
to
forgive
george
not
to
prosecute
him
not
to
give
him
up
to
the
law
ah
i
thought
that
was
coming
and
why
pray
should
i
not
prosecute
the
young
rascal
do
you
think
he
richly
deserves
punishment
honestly
i
do
when
effie
said
this
gering
eyes
twinkled
for
the
first
time
eh
eh
he
exclaimed
i
am
glad
we
of
one
mind
on
that
point
we
both
doubtless
believe
that
punishment
would
be
good
for
him
we
do
then
why
deprive
him
of
anything
so
beneficial
because
of
my
mother
your
mother
is
there
a
mother
in
the
case
there
is
a
mother
who
lies
now
at
the
point
of
death
let
me
tell
you
her
story
i
have
read
my
letters
yet
miss
staunton
oh
never
mind
your
letters
let
me
tell
you
about
my
father
and
my
mother
four
months
ago
my
father
was
alive
he
was
a
country
doctor
he
was
very
good
everyone
loved
him
he
caught
diphtheria
and
died
my
mother
has
heart
disease
and
my
father
felt
sure
that
the
shock
of
losing
him
would
kill
her
he
loved
her
most
tenderly
when
he
lay
dying
he
was
certain
that
god
would
allow
them
both
to
leave
the
world
together
my
mother
was
kneeling
by
his
bedside
and
george
my
brother
knelt
there
too
and
my
brother
said
take
mother
away
father
and
then
father
said
to
mother
with
george
at
that
moment
something
strange
must
have
happened
all
my
mother
great
love
seemed
suddenly
directed
into
a
new
channel
her
love
for
george
since
that
moment
has
been
the
passion
of
her
life
he
was
not
no
indeed
interrupted
gering
no
and
he
yielded
to
temptation
and
got
into
trouble
and
and
lost
money
but
all
the
time
my
mother
has
been
imagining
that
he
is
the
best
and
steadiest
fellow
in
london
she
lives
in
a
sort
of
golden
dream
about
him
if
she
learns
the
truth
she
will
certainly
die
and
george
will
be
lost
he
will
then
as
he
himself
expresses
it
forever
he
wo
be
able
to
stand
the
thought
that
through
his
sin
and
weakness
he
has
killed
his
mother
i
should
hope
not
interrupted
gering
therefore
i
want
you
to
forgive
him
it
is
your
duty
my
duty
child
what
right
have
you
to
come
and
talk
to
me
about
my
duty
every
right
if
i
can
only
make
you
perform
it
you
are
either
impertinent
or
very
brave
young
lady
i
was
never
spoken
to
in
this
strain
before
well
you
see
it
is
a
matter
of
life
and
death
said
effie
i
mince
words
when
life
and
death
hang
in
the
balance
you
a
queer
girl
a
queer
girl
i
do
know
what
to
make
of
you
my
word
i
sorry
for
that
mother
of
yours
poor
soul
poor
soul
it
a
pity
she
did
bring
up
her
son
as
conscientiously
as
she
did
her
daughter
now
you
would
have
taken
fifty
pounds
out
of
my
till
no
said
effie
i
wish
you
were
a
boy
i
give
you
that
lad
place
within
an
hour
thank
you
but
i
do
think
i
should
care
to
have
it
will
you
come
now
and
do
your
duty
come
where
am
i
to
come
to
see
george
the
rascal
where
is
he
i
take
you
to
him
do
you
know
that
you
are
bullying
me
in
the
most
shameful
way
miss
staunton
i
know
that
you
have
a
very
kind
heart
answered
effie
at
this
moment
the
room
door
was
opened
and
power
came
in
again
fortescue
has
called
sir
tell
fortescue
that
i
ca
see
him
and
ford
has
sent
round
about
that
shipping
order
when
can
you
give
him
his
answer
some
time
this
afternoon
but
they
want
it
this
morning
well
they
ca
have
it
i
going
out
for
a
bit
come
along
miss
staunton
we
ca
let
the
grass
grow
under
our
feet
chapter
xxiii
there
come
moments
in
the
lives
of
all
of
us
when
we
feel
as
if
a
restraining
and
powerful
hand
were
pulling
us
up
short
we
have
come
to
a
full
stop
we
can
not
go
back
and
we
do
not
know
how
to
proceed
these
full
stops
in
life
journey
are
generally
awful
places
we
meet
there
as
a
rule
the
devil
and
his
angels
they
tear
us
and
rend
us
they
shake
us
to
our
very
depths
with
awful
and
overpowering
temptation
if
we
yield
it
is
all
over
with
us
we
rush
at
headlong
speed
downhill
but
on
the
other
hand
if
in
this
pause
we
turn
our
back
upon
the
devil
good
angels
come
in
his
place
they
whisper
of
hope
and
a
new
chance
in
life
even
for
us
when
effie
left
george
on
that
miserable
evening
and
when
lawson
retired
presently
to
his
room
the
young
man
found
that
he
had
come
to
such
a
fearful
place
of
trial
as
i
have
just
described
he
was
pulled
up
short
and
the
devil
was
tempting
him
at
one
side
was
the
devil
at
the
other
he
saw
the
face
of
his
mother
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
lie
down
and
sleep
he
fought
with
the
devil
all
night
in
the
morning
there
was
neither
victory
nor
defeat
but
the
young
smooth
face
looked
haggard
and
gray
and
the
upright
figure
was
bowed
lawson
came
into
the
sitting
room
for
a
moment
i
am
sorry
i
ca
stay
with
you
george
he
said
i
am
due
at
joseph
at
nine
have
you
made
any
plans
for
yourself
no
at
least
yes
i
had
an
awful
night
lawson
and
there
seems
to
be
but
one
end
to
it
what
is
that
i
must
give
myself
up
i
not
the
sort
of
fellow
to
play
the
hiding
game
successfully
i
safe
to
be
caught
sooner
or
later
i
deserve
punishment
too
i
been
doing
badly
for
months
what
i
deserve
it
seems
likely
i
have
in
short
i
think
i
better
make
a
clean
breast
of
everything
and
take
my
my
punishment
like
a
man
do
sit
down
for
a
minute
said
lawson
there
a
good
deal
in
what
you
say
and
if
you
had
only
yourself
to
consider
i
counsel
you
to
do
it
i
would
truly
but
there
your
mother
to
be
thought
of
my
mother
do
you
suppose
i
been
thinking
of
my
mother
all
night
it
is
the
thought
of
my
mother
that
maddens
me
maddens
me
i
say
look
here
lawson
there
only
one
thing
before
me
i
go
first
to
mother
and
tell
her
everything
straight
out
and
then
i
give
myself
up
you
will
said
lawson
with
a
start
of
sudden
admiration
upon
my
word
george
old
chap
i
did
think
you
had
the
grit
in
you
i
did
truly
then
you
approve
it
is
the
only
thing
to
be
done
she
must
hear
it
sooner
or
later
and
no
one
can
tell
it
to
her
as
you
can
all
right
i
go
to
her
before
my
courage
fails
me
george
left
the
room
without
even
saying
to
his
friend
when
he
left
the
house
he
turned
round
and
saw
the
man
whom
he
had
noticed
watching
him
the
day
before
at
waterloo
station
i
be
ready
for
you
soon
my
friend
but
not
quite
yet
muttered
the
young
man
he
walked
quickly
the
man
followed
him
at
a
respectful
distance
george
let
himself
into
his
mother
house
with
a
he
ran
up
to
the
little
sitting
room
agnes
was
bending
with
red
eyes
over
a
kettle
which
was
boiling
on
the
fire
she
was
making
a
cup
of
tea
for
her
mother
who
had
just
awakened
katie
was
cutting
bread
and
butter
and
phil
and
marjory
were
standing
by
the
window
marjory
was
saying
to
phil
i
george
will
be
turning
the
corner
and
coming
home
in
a
minute
hush
whispered
phil
hush
marjory
george
is
coming
back
any
more
at
this
moment
the
door
was
opened
and
george
came
in
marjory
gave
phil
a
scornful
glance
and
flew
to
her
big
brother
katie
flung
down
the
piece
of
bread
she
was
buttering
and
agnes
turned
from
the
fire
george
put
out
his
hand
to
ward
them
all
off
where
mother
he
asked
she
awake
but
she
has
been
very
ill
began
agnes
oh
george
george
do
be
careful
where
are
you
going
to
my
mother
answered
the
young
man
do
let
anyone
come
with
me
i
want
to
be
alone
with
her
he
went
straight
into
the
bedroom
as
he
spoke
and
shut
the
door
behind
him
staunton
was
lying
propped
up
high
by
pillows
the
powerful
opiate
had
soothed
her
but
the
image
of
george
still
filled
all
her
horizon
when
she
saw
him
come
into
the
room
she
smiled
and
stretched
out
her
weak
arms
to
clasp
him
he
came
over
knelt
by
her
and
taking
her
hot
hands
covered
his
face
with
them
you
come
back
my
boy
she
said
i
not
very
well
but
i
